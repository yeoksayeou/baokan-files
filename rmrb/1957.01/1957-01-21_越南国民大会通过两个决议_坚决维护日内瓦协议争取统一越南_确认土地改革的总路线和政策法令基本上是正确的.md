Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 20th: According to Vietnam News Agency, the 6th session of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam passed two resolutions on the struggle for the reunification of Vietnam and on land reform work at a plenary session held on the evening of the 18th.

The resolution on the struggle for the reunification of Vietnam once again declares that the position of the Vietnamese people is to resolutely respect and continue to implement the Geneva Accords, while also requiring the relevant parties to respect and continue to implement the Geneva Accords.

The resolution states: The National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam once again confirms that the position of the people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is to resolutely hold high the banner of peace and unity and continue to strive for the reunification of the country on the basis of independence and democracy through peaceful means. It recognizes that this struggle is a long and arduous revolutionary struggle, but it will surely be victorious.

The strength exerted by the unity and struggle of the entire people of North and South Vietnam is a decisive force in this struggle. The Geneva Accords are an important international legal basis to help us advance this struggle.

Based on the above reasons, the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam unanimously approves the government's policies in order to carry out the following tasks:

Strive to strengthen North Vietnam in all aspects so that it becomes a consolidated base for the struggle for national reunification; resolutely maintain and develop the struggle of the people of South Vietnam; strengthen external activities and strive for the support and assistance of the peace-loving people and governments of all countries in the world; at present, make the greatest efforts to intensify the struggle for the restoration and development of normal relations between North and South Vietnam.

The resolution went on to say that the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam welcomes all efforts made by patriotic Vietnamese people for the cause of national reunification and all contributions made. It welcomes all contacts and exchanges of views between individuals and groups in North and South Vietnam, as well as at home and abroad, in order to take joint action against the US imperialists and their clique of running dogs and to strive to build a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, prosperous and strong Vietnam.

The National Assembly believes that, legally, factually, and practically, the South Vietnamese government is bound by the Geneva Accords and has a responsibility to continue to implement these agreements. The French government is also a signatory to the Geneva Accords and also has a responsibility to continue to implement these agreements. But until now, the South Vietnamese authorities have continued to violate the Geneva Accords and continue to refuse to hold consultations with the North. The South Vietnamese authorities have violated the ardent wishes of the entire Vietnamese people. They must be held responsible before the people and the motherland for the continued division of Vietnam.

The resolution emphasizes that the National Assembly firmly believes that the struggle to achieve national reunification will inevitably achieve final victory.

The resolution on land reform work states: In North Vietnam, the land reform movement has now been basically completed, and the anti-feudal task in the North has been basically completed. The resolution confirms that the general line and policies related to land reform are fundamentally correct.

The resolution states that the National Assembly believes: "We will surely overcome all difficulties, expand our achievements, complete our tasks, victoriously complete land reform, and further consolidate North Vietnam, making it a solid base for the struggle to restore national unity."

    越南国民大会通过两个决议
    坚决维护日内瓦协议争取统一越南
    确认土地改革的总路线和政策法令基本上是正确的
    新华社河内20日电　据越南通讯社讯：越南民主共和国国民大会第六次会议18日晚上举行的全体会议一致通过了关于为恢复越南统一而斗争和土地改革工作的两个决议。
    为恢复越南统一而斗争的决议再一次宣布，越南人民的立场是坚决尊重和继续履行日内瓦协议，同时要求有关方面尊重和继续执行日内瓦协议。
    这个决议说：越南民主共和国国民大会再一次确认，越南民主共和国人民和政府的立场是坚决高举和平和统一的旗帜，继续为通过和平手段在独立和民主的基础上恢复国家统一而奋斗。它认识到这个斗争是一个长期而艰苦的革命斗争，但是一定会获得胜利。
    越南北部和南部全体人民的团结和斗争所发挥的力量，是这个斗争中的具有决定意义的力量。日内瓦协议是帮助我们推进这个斗争的重要的国际法律根据。
    根据上述理由，越南民主共和国国民大会一致批准政府政策，以便执行下列任务：
    努力在各方面加强北越，使它成为为国家统一而斗争的巩固的基地；坚决维持和发展南越人民的斗争；加强对外活动，争取全世界爱好和平的各国人民和政府的赞助和支持；在目前，进行最大的努力，为恢复并且发展越南北部和南部之间的正常关系而加紧进行斗争。
    决议接着说，越南民主共和国国民大会欢迎一切爱国的越南人为了全国统一的事业而进行的一切努力以及所作出的一切贡献。它欢迎在越南北部和南部以及国内和国外的个人和团体中间进行的一切接触和交换意见，以便采取联合行动反对美帝国主义者和他们的走狗集团并且为争取建成和平、统一、独立、民主、繁荣、强盛的越南而斗争。
    国民大会认为，在法律上、在事实上、在实践上，南越政府都受日内瓦协议的约束，并且有责任继续实施这些协议。法国政府也是日内瓦协议的签字国，也有责任继续实现这些协议。但是直到现在，南越当局仍然继续破坏日内瓦协议，继续拒绝同北方举行协商。南越当局违反了全体越南人民的热烈的愿望。他们必须在人民和祖国面前对延续越南分裂状态负责。
    决议强调说，国民大会坚决相信，实现全国统一的斗争必然会取得最后胜利。
    关于土地改革工作的决议说：在越南北部，土地改革运动目前已经基本上完成，北部的反封建任务已经基本上完成。决议确认有关土地改革的总路线和政策法令基本上是正确的。
    决议说，国民大会相信：“我们一定会克服一切困难，扩大成就，完成我们的任务，胜利地完成土地改革，进一步巩固越南北部，使它成为为恢复国家统一而斗争的巩固的基地。”
