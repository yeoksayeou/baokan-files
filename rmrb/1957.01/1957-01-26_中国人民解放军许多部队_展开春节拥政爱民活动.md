Xinhua News Agency, January 25th—Many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have launched Spring Festival activities to support the government and cherish the people.

    The units of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Nanjing area have dispatched working groups that are visiting local Party and government organs, factories, schools, agricultural production cooperatives, and residents, gaining an in-depth understanding of national construction and people's lives, and soliciting opinions on the troops. These working groups have been warmly welcomed by cadres of Party and government organs and the people. The troops of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Lüda area have been carrying out various activities to support the government and cherish the people since January 20. They introduced to the people the fine traditions, fighting history, and achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in supporting and defending national construction, inspected the troops' compliance with mass discipline, and discussed with local agricultural production cooperatives the troops' plans to support agricultural production this year. They also allocated some transport boats and vehicles to help Lüda solve transportation difficulties during the Spring Festival. The troops of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Xilingol League of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region braved the severe cold to vacate some houses to help some government cadres, workers, and residents solve the problem of housing shortages, so that the army, government, and people could jointly celebrate the Spring Festival.

    The People's Liberation Army stationed in Nanchang has also launched a month-long movement to support the government and cherish the people. On the 23rd, the leading organs of the garrison invited representatives from all walks of life to a forum to solicit their opinions on the troops. The leading organs of the garrison also called on officers not to compete with citizens for pork during the Spring Festival. Various garrison troops are preparing to carry out various joint celebration activities with people from all walks of life; the troops' film projection teams will screen films during the Spring Festival to entertain residents, government cadres, workers, and students.

    Many units of the People's Liberation Army Navy have initially completed the inspection of mass discipline and have taken concrete measures to further strengthen military-government and military-civilian unity in all aspects based on the opinions of local governments and the people. Last year, officers and soldiers of a certain unit helped local farmers and fishermen establish many production cooperatives and achieve bumper harvests. Recently, this unit has transferred a large number of officers to help these cooperatives carry out rectification work and launch winter production movements. (Attached picture)

    解放军驻南京地区部队各单位都派出了工作组，正在访问驻地党政机关、工厂、学校、农业生产合作社和居民，深入了解国家建设和人民生活的情况，并且征求对部队的意见。这些工作组普遍受到党、政机关干部和人民群众的热情欢迎。解放军驻旅大地区部队从1月20日起，已经分别展开拥政爱民的各种活动。他们向人民群众介绍中国人民解放军的优良传统、斗争历史、支援和保卫国家建设的成就，检查部队执行群众纪律的情况，并且同驻地农业生产合作社商定部队今年支援农业生产的计划。他们还拨出了一些运输艇和汽车，帮助旅大市解决在春节期间运输上的困难。解放军驻内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒盟地区的部队还冒着严寒腾出一部分房屋，帮助一些政府干部、工人和居民解决了缺少住屋的困难，使军、政、民共同欢度春节。
    中国人民解放军驻南昌部队也已开展了拥政爱民运动月。23日，驻军领导机关邀请了各界代表座谈，征求他们对部队的意见。驻军领导机关还号召军官们春节期间不和市民争购猪肉。各驻军部队正在准备和各界人民进行各种联欢活动；部队的电影放映队在春节期间将放映电影招待居民、机关干部、工人和学生。
    解放军海军许多部队对群众纪律的检查工作已经初步结束，并且根据当地政府和人民群众的意见，采取了从各方面进一步加强军政和军民团结的具体措施。某部官兵在去年曾经帮助驻地农民和渔民办了许多生产合作社，并且获得丰收，最近这个部队又抽调出大批军官去帮助这些合作社进行整社工作，开展冬季生产运动。（附图片）
