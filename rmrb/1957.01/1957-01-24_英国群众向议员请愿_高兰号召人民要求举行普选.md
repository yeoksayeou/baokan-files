Xinhua News Agency, London, January 23rd: According to TASS, London, January 22nd, many working people in London went to the Houses of Parliament on the 22nd to request meetings with parliamentarians, in order to express to them their firm opposition to the government's plan to raise rents and opposition to the continuous rise in prices. Representatives of working people elected by trade unions and mass meetings from various cities across the country also came to London to protest together with Londoners.
	The three representatives of the Bedwas coal mine (South Wales) brought a petition signed by 350 people. The petition stated: "We want peace and socialism, and we demand a higher standard of living. We demand the abandonment of the policy of raising rents. Down with the Conservatives."
	Another delegation of miners from South Wales also brought a petition demanding fundamental improvements in the living conditions of workers. Representatives of working people from Glasgow, Dundee, Edinburgh, and other cities also arrived in London with similar petitions.

Xinhua News Agency, London, January 23rd: According to TASS, London, January 21st, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, Gollan, delivered a speech at a mass meeting in Aberdare on the 20th, calling on the British working people to actively organize delegations to visit parliamentarians on the day of the resumption of Parliament on the 22nd, demanding an immediate general election.
	Gollan pointed out that the composition of the new cabinet pleased big business owners. He said that on the day the government announced the reshuffle, a widely circulated newspaper reported that there was jubilation on the stock exchange, and "everyone was happy that the old order had been restored in Downing Street and consolidated by the right wing."
	Gollan also called for launching a powerful movement to fight for higher wages and improved living conditions for the working people.

The Deputy General Secretary of the Communist Party, Matthews, emphasized at a mass meeting in Newcastle upon Tyne on the same day the need to change the direction of British foreign policy. He demanded that the delegations of British working people point this out to parliamentarians when they visit them on the 22nd.
	He said: "Britain should choose another path, a path that can guarantee our independence. Only this path can guarantee our status as a great power and help our country occupy its due place among the world's advanced peace-loving nations."
	He pointed out that taking this path requires refusing to yield to the United States, and instead being friendly and trading with the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, abandoning the oppression of colonial peoples, and reaching agreements on disarmament and European security.

    英国群众向议员请愿
    高兰号召人民要求举行普选
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社伦敦22日讯：伦敦许多劳动人民22日到议院大厦前要求会见议员，以便向他们表示坚决反对政府提高房租的计划和反对物价的不断高涨。由全国各个城市的工会和群众大会选出来的劳动群众的代表也来到了伦敦，同伦敦人一起提出抗议。
    贝德华斯煤矿（南威尔士）工人的三个代表带来了一份有三百五十个人签名的请愿书。请愿书说：“我们希望和平和社会主义，我们要求提高生活水平。我们要求放弃提高房租的政策。打倒保守党人。”
    另一个南威尔士矿工代表团也带来了请愿书，要求根本地改善劳动者的生活条件。格拉斯哥、敦提、爱丁堡和其他城市劳动群众的代表也带着同样的请愿书到了伦敦。
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社伦敦21日讯：英国共产党总书记高兰20日在亚伯达尔的群众集会上发表演说，号召英国劳动人民积极组织代表团在22日议会复会的日子去访问议员，要求立即举行普选。
    高兰指出新内阁的组成使大企业主高兴。他说，在政府宣布改组的那一天，有一家销路很广的日报报道说，交易所里一片欢腾，“大家都对唐宁街恢复旧秩序并且靠右派得到巩固感到高兴”。
    高兰还号召发动一个强大的运动来争取提高工资和改善劳动人民的处境。
    共产党副总书记马修斯同一天在泰因河上的纽卡斯尔的群众集会上强调必须改变英国的外交政策方针。他要求英国劳动人民的代表团22日访问议员的时候向议员们指出这一点。
    他说：“英国应该选择另一条道路，这条道路要能保障我们的独立。唯有这条道路能保证我国的大国地位，有助于我国在世界先进的爱好和平的国家中占应有的地位。”
    他指出，走这条道路，就要拒绝屈从美国，而同苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家友好和进行贸易，放弃对殖民地人民的压迫，达成裁军和欧洲安全协议。
