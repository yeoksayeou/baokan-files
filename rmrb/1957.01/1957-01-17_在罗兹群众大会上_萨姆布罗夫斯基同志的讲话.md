Xinhua News Agency, Luozi, January 16th: According to a report by the Polish News Agency, Zambrowski, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, spoke at a mass rally in Luozi on the 15th to welcome the Chinese government delegation.

    Comrade Zambrowski first welcomed the visit of the Chinese guests and praised China for playing a huge and growing role in today's world affairs. He pointed out that in the big family of socialist countries, with the Soviet Union and the powerful People's China, the Polish people are stronger and more confident in their daily work and struggle. He said that because we know that the great Chinese people are with us, our struggle for the just cause of socialism and the development of our country will be easier. The friendship and fraternal cooperation between all socialist countries is a great source of our strength. Our responsibility lies in defending this friendship as the most precious thing and resolutely fighting against all attempts to undermine it.

    Comrade Zambrowski said that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit clearly shows that Poland and People's China are linked by political and ideological ties. The cooperation between our two countries is constantly developing and consolidating, and we are linked by the common goal of building socialism.

    Zambrowski then expressed Poland's full support for the restoration of People's China's legitimate rights in the United Nations and the struggle to liberate Taiwan. He also expressed his great gratitude to the Chinese government for its opposition to the revival of German aggressive forces and its insistence on the inviolability of Poland's western border.

    Zambrowski pointed out that recent developments have once again shown that the friendship between China and Poland, as well as all socialist countries, is essential. He said that although the Cold War policy has suffered many setbacks in recent years, some imperialist blocs are still engaged in activities that endanger peace. This makes us realize that the struggle to defend peace still requires enormous efforts. This struggle requires, first and foremost, the more consolidated unity of all countries in the socialist camp and the closer cooperation and concerted action of all communist and workers' parties.

    Comrade Zambrowski said that we highly value the experience of the Chinese Communist Party, which has achieved historic victories in building socialism by adopting a wise policy that suits China's needs and conditions and establishing a solid connection with the people. We would like to tell our Chinese comrades that Poland will build socialism in a way that best suits our needs and conditions, and we are implementing the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, which is of equal importance to workers of all countries, in the best possible way.

    在罗兹群众大会上
    萨姆布罗夫斯基同志的讲话
    新华社罗兹16日电　据波兰通讯社报道，波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局委员萨姆布罗夫斯基15日在罗兹举行的欢迎中国政府代表团的群众大会上讲了话。
    萨姆布罗夫斯基同志首先对中国客人的访问表示欢迎，并且称赞中国在今天的世界事务中起着巨大的、不断增长的作用。他指出，在社会主义国家的大家庭中，有了苏联加上强大的人民中国，波兰人民在日常工作、斗争中就更加坚强和充满信心。他说，由于我们知道同我们一起的有伟大的中国人民，我们为社会主义的正义事业和我国的发展而进行的斗争就要容易些。所有社会主义国家之间的友谊和兄弟合作是我们的力量的巨大泉源。我们的责任就在于把这种友谊当作最珍贵的东西来保卫它，并且同打算削弱这种友谊的一切企图进行坚决的斗争。
    萨姆布罗夫斯基同志说，周恩来总理的访问清楚地表明，波兰和人民中国是由政治上、思想上的纽带联结在一起的。我们两国之间的合作正在不断地发展和巩固，我们是由建设社会主义的共同目的联结起来的。
    萨姆布罗夫斯基接着表示，波兰竭力支持人民中国恢复在联合国组织中的合法地位和解放台湾的斗争。他并且对中国政府反对德国侵略势力复活和主张波兰西部边界不可侵犯的态度，表示极大的感谢。
    萨姆布罗夫斯基指出，最近的事态发展再一次表明，中国和波兰之间以及所有社会主义国家之间的友谊是十分必要的。他说，尽管冷战政策在最近几年中遭受了许多失败，但是，某些帝国主义集团还在继续从事危害和平的活动。使我们知道，保卫和平的斗争仍然需要巨大的努力。这个斗争首先需要社会主义阵营所有国家更加巩固的团结以及所有共产党和工人党更加紧密的合作和行动一致。
    萨姆布罗夫斯基同志说，我们极其珍视中国共产党的经验，中国共产党由于采取了适合中国需要和条件的明智的政策，同人民建立了巩固的联系，在建设社会主义中获得了历史性的胜利。我们愿意告诉中国同志，波兰将通过按照最适合我们的需要和条件的方式建设社会主义，我们正在以尽可能好的方式实行对各国工人具有同等重要性的马克思列宁主义普遍真理。
