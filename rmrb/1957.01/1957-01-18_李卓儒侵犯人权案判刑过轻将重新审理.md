Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 17th: The case of Li Zhuoru, a cadre of the Guangzhou Municipal Sports Commission, who violated citizens' rights, will be reprocessed. On the 12th, the Guangdong Provincial Higher People's Court revoked the original judgment and sent the case back to the original trial court for retrial.

The defendant, Li Zhuoru, was the director of the Ershatou construction office of the Guangzhou Municipal Sports Commission. After losing public funds, he did not report to the public security and procuratorial organs, but illegally subjected Yi Xixi, a subordinate staff member, to personal searches, and took a series of measures such as restricting Yi Xixi's personal and communication freedom, and pursuing and struggling against him. Yi Xixi committed suicide after being greatly stimulated mentally. After Li Zhuoru's illegal incident was exposed, the Guangzhou Municipal Intermediate People's Court sentenced him to one year in prison with a one-year reprieve. Many people felt that the sentence was too light and demanded a retrial. The Guangdong Provincial Higher People's Court studied the opinions of the masses, revoked the original judgment, and sent the case back to the Guangzhou Municipal Intermediate People's Court for retrial.

    李卓儒侵犯人权案判刑过轻将重新审理
    据新华社广州17日电　广州市体育运动委员会干部李卓儒侵犯公民权利的案件将要重新处理。广东省高级人民法院12日已将原判撤消，把案件发还原审法院重新审理。
    被告李卓儒是广州市体育运动委员会二沙头工地筹建办公室主任。他在失窃公款后，不向公安、检察机关报告，竟非法地对所属工作人员易熙熙进行人身搜查，并对易熙熙采取了限制人身和通讯自由、追逼、斗争等一系列措施。易熙熙在精神受到很大刺激后自杀死亡。李卓儒的这一违法事件被揭发后，广州市中级人民法院对他判处徒刑一年，缓刑一年。许多群众认为量刑太轻，要求重新审理。广东省高级人民法院根据群众意见作了研究，撤消了原判，把这一案件发回广州市中级人民法院重新审理。
