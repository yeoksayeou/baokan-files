    (Our report) Sichuan's military and civilians are enthusiastically carrying out activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of armymen and to support the government to cherish the people. The provincial and municipal joint consolation groups will set off to console the wounded and sick soldiers and those undergoing recuperation. At the same time, grand consolation galas will be held to comfort the troops stationed there and their families. Xindu County has also trained a group of rural propaganda backbone elements to lead the masses in various townships and towns to carry out literary and artistic activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of armymen. Yibin City has also mobilized women and youths to clean courtyards and sew laundry for families of martyrs, armymen, and demobilized disabled soldiers. Various localities are also conducting universal inspections of preferential treatment and demobilization resettlement work. More than 400,000 copies of publicity materials on preferential treatment work have been distributed throughout the province. Many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Sichuan have sent inspection teams to visit local organs, residents, and agricultural cooperatives to check mass discipline and solicit opinions on the troops. The masses in various localities generally thanked the troops stationed there for helping them with production. Last year alone, the troops stationed in Mianyang, Aba, Jiangjin, and other places helped agricultural cooperatives with nearly 60,000 labor days; the troops stationed in Suining, Neijiang, Luzhou, and other places helped the masses accumulate 560,000 dan of fertilizer; and many agricultural cooperatives also received books, new agricultural tools, and recreational supplies donated by the troops. During the Spring Festival, the troops stationed in many places decided to do a good deed for the people, chopping firewood, carrying water, repairing roads, and sweeping courtyards for the masses.
