    The Heart of a Cooperative Member
    Xue Ya

    “No matter what you say, I’m leaving the cooperative.” Wu Chaohe, an old member of the Five-Star Agricultural Cooperative, said this and slumped into a chair, feeling like the frustration pent up inside him was about to burst.

    After the autumn harvest distribution plan for Sanlizhuang in Guan County, Shandong Province, was announced, the Party branch, in order to understand the opinions of the masses on the distribution and the agricultural cooperative, organized cooperative cadres and Party members to visit some cooperative members separately. Wu Chaohe, a member of the Five-Star Agricultural Cooperative, was one of those visited. Cadres and Party members lived in the same village as Wu Chaohe and usually knew about the difficulties of each family and the opinions of each cooperative member. However, they didn't have a clear understanding of this old cooperative member. This old member joined the cooperative in 1953, always worked hard, and had a good reputation, rarely expressing any opinions about others. He knew that if the cooperative was run well, his good days would not be far off. Although he was already sixty-eight years old, he stubbornly refused to let the cooperative provide him with the "Five Guarantees" and worked diligently, earning more than two hundred work points in 1955 alone, all recorded in the work point ledger. But how could he suddenly be talking about withdrawing from the cooperative!

    Wu Chaohe spoke again:

    “My person may leave the cooperative, but my heart will not. As long as you let me withdraw, I won’t take anything with me, no shares, no funds, nothing. I’ll leave it all in the cooperative.” This was even stranger. Who ever heard of withdrawing from a cooperative like that! Zhu Zihuai, the director of the agricultural cooperative, saw that he was still struggling to speak smoothly and comforted him:

    “Withdrawing is possible. But tell me, where did this anger come from?”

    “There’s no anger, the Communist Party points out a good path, but the guides are messing things up.”

    “The more you talk, the more confused I get. What exactly is your problem?”

    “This spring, we were short of food and borrowed money from the cooperative. The cadres said the cooperative was having difficulties and couldn’t provide funds. I thought it made sense. The cooperative has many difficulties, buying farm tools, repairing water conservancy, all of which require money. Individual difficulties are easier to overcome, so I just endured it! I sold my salt jar and kitchen cabinet, and then sold the bellows, finally scraping together a few dozen yuan to buy some grain. Then I thought, just eating isn't enough, I have to work to increase grain production!” At this point, he paused, reached out to wipe his eyes, and continued:

    “When you encounter such cadres, you can only swallow your bitterness. I’m not reaching out to them for food; I want to work. But how do you think the cadres treated me? They wouldn't let me work, and even if I worked, they wouldn't record my work points. I didn't listen to them. When has the Communist Party ever told people not to work! If they didn’t assign me work, I would go and collect manure myself. If they had just let me collect manure smoothly, that would have been fine, but who knew they would spread rumors saying I was a loafer, looking for easy work. See, they're not guiding our path; they're blocking it off.

    “Having no other option, I went to the city to find work. Who knew that I would collapse in a ditch on the edge of the city. Passers-by helped me up and wanted to take me to the hospital, saying I was sick. I knew in my heart that I was just dizzy from hunger, it wasn't a disease! I could only say it was an old ailment that would pass soon. What else could I say? Could I tell others, ‘I fainted from hunger’? No, our cooperative is an old cooperative, it’s the Five-Star Cooperative, and we can't let anyone say that an old member of the Five-Star Cooperative fainted from hunger! But what do you think our cadres did? The team leader and Party branch secretary took the money that everyone had worked so hard to earn and spent it recklessly themselves. The cooperative belongs to everyone; can we just watch those wastrels without saying a word? I couldn’t! I spoke up. This infuriated the cadres. So, they wouldn't let me use cooperative funds to buy food, wouldn't let me work, and even called me a loafer! For the sake of the cooperative, I could endure even harder days, but how can one live like this! I had no choice but to do this: first withdraw from the cooperative, and when they’re no longer in charge, I'll rejoin. I’m an old cooperative member, and no matter what, good or bad, I’m still a member.”

    When I was visiting Comrade Ji Xianxi, Deputy Secretary of the Liaocheng Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, he told me in detail about this incident, which he had recently investigated. He said that during the process of visiting cooperative members, the Sanlizhuang branch discovered a total of twenty-seven such cooperative members who spoke their minds. The branch quickly dealt with the matter, and the problems were resolved. However, Comrade Ji Xianxi still recorded the opinions of these twenty-seven cooperative members in detail in his notebook. Wherever he went, he would have people read the opinions of these twenty-seven cooperative members in detail at the cadre meetings before discussing what should be done. Comrade Ji Xianxi closed his notebook and said thoughtfully: Without understanding the ideological state of the masses, without understanding the hearts of the cooperative members, any leadership is just empty talk.

    The reason I recorded what Comrade Ji Xianxi said is simply to use it as a mirror for people to look at themselves.

    社员的心
    薛雅
    “说什么，我也不在社里了。”五星农业社的老社员吴潮河说完了这句话，往椅子上一躺，心里憋的那股气，都快出不来了。
    山东冠县三里庄的秋收分配方案公布以后，党支部为了了解群众对分配和农业社的意见，组织社干部、党员分别访问了一些社员。五星农业社的社员吴潮河，就是被访问的一个。干部、党员同吴潮河住在一个庄里，平时也知道一些哪家有什么困难，哪个社员有什么意见；可是，对这个老社员却不摸底。这个老社员1953年入社，从来劳动好，人品好，对于别人很少有过什么意见。他知道社办好了，自己的好日子就不远了。虽然他已经六十八岁了，硬不要社来“五保”他，自己一个劲儿劳动，1955年一年就挣了二百多元的劳动工分，都记在工分账上了。可是，他怎么倒闹起退社来了！
    吴潮河又说话了：
    “我人离社心不离社，只要让我退社，我什么也不带走，什么股份基金啦，啥都留在社里。”这更奇了，哪有退社像这样退法的呢！农业社的社长朱子怀看他还是说话气不顺，就安慰他说：
    “退社是可以的。你倒说说打哪儿来的这股子闷气？”
    “没有啥闷气，共产党指引的路好，可是引路人在那里胡摆弄。”
    “你越说我越胡涂了，你究竟有啥问题呀？”
    “今年春季缺口粮，向社里借款，干部说，社里有困难，支不出钱。我一想也对，社大困难多，买农具，修水利，哪样不要用钱，个人的困难好熬过，就克服点吧！先把咱的盐罐、厨柜卖了，又把风箱卖了，好容易凑了几十元，买了一些粮食。又一想，光吃不中用，得劳动增产粮食才行哪！”说到这里，他停了一下，伸手擦眼睛，又接着说：
    “遇到这样的干部，有苦处只好往肚里咽。我不是伸手向他们要吃的，我要劳动。你想干部怎样对我说呢？他们不叫我劳动，劳动了也不给记工分。我不听他们的话，共产党啥时候也没叫人不劳动！不给我派活，我就自己拾粪去。要是他们能叫我顺溜地拾粪倒也吧，谁知道他们又风言风语说我是二流子，找轻巧活儿干。你看，他们不是引咱的路，是把咱的路子都堵死了。
    “没有办法，我就跑到城里去找活儿干。谁知走到城边边上，就倒在沟里了。过路的人把我扶起来，要送我进医院，说我发了病。我心里明白，是饿晕了，哪里是什么病！我只好说是老病，过一会儿就好。我能说什么呢？我能告诉旁人‘我饿晕了’吗？不能，我们的社是老社，是五星社，说什么也不能让人说咱五星社的老社员饿晕啦！可你想我们的干部怎么样呢？队长、支部书记把大家辛苦得来的钱拿去，自己胡花了。社是大家的社，能看着败家子不说话吗？我不依！说了话。这可把干部惹恼了。就这样，他们不让我使社里的钱买口粮，不让我干活，还说我是二流子！为了社，再苦的日子也能过下去，这样的日子叫人怎样过呢！我只好这样办，先退社，等他们不当家了，我再入社。我是老社员，不管啥时候好坏也是个社员。”
    在我访问中共聊城地方委员会副书记籍献西同志的时候，他把最近下去调查到的这件事详细地告诉了我。他说，三里庄支部在访问社员的过程中，一共发现了二十七户这样的社员，都说出了心里的话。支部很快地作了处理，问题都解决了。可是籍献西同志仍然把这二十七户社员的意见，都详细地记录在他的记事本中。他到那里，就叫人在干部会上详细念这二十七户社员的意见，而后才讨论应当怎么办。籍献西同志合上了记事本，深思地说：不摸清群众思想状况，不了解社员的心，什么领导都是空话。
    我所以记录了籍献西同志所说的这件事，只是想把它作为一面镜子，让人们来照一照。
