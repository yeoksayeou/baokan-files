Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 21st: Last year, Hubei Province achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of grain and cotton. Can it continue to move forward this year and strive for an even greater harvest? Xinhua News Agency reporters interviewed the person in charge of Hubei Province's agricultural department on this issue.

The person in charge said that some people did have the idea of ​​"reaching the peak of production" after Hubei Province's bumper harvest of grain and cotton. Recently, various places have combined the summary of last year's production work and criticized this idea. The recent provincial agricultural work conference focused on discussing the issue of agricultural production potential. The conclusion reached was that Hubei Province's agricultural production potential has not only not been fully tapped, but is still very large, and the various favorable factors for increasing production are not less than before, but more. He pointed out that, judging from the yield per unit area of ​​grain last year, the province averaged only 420 jin per mu based on arable land, while many yielded 700 to 800 jin per mu. The average grain yield per mu in Xiaogan, Huangpi and other counties exceeded 800 jin. There were nearly 2,000 "thousand-jin cooperatives" in the province with a yield of 1,000 jin of grain per mu, and some high-yielding fields reached 2,000 jin per mu. Last year, the province averaged 44 jin of ginned cotton per mu, while many "hundred-jin ginned cotton townships" and more than 700 "hundred-jin ginned cotton cooperatives" emerged. Xiangyang Prefecture, which had the lowest cotton yield per unit area in the past, more than doubled its yield last year. The transition from unbalanced to balanced production is a great potential for increased production. He went on to say that Hubei Province's favorable factors for developing agricultural production are: Hubei Province is located on both sides of the Yangtze and Han Rivers, with fertile land, a mild climate, and abundant rainfall. In the past year, because many agricultural cooperatives were newly built and lacked experience in management, the utilization of these favorable natural conditions was limited to a certain extent. In the future, as agricultural cooperatives gain more experience in management, it will be possible to make fuller use of them. The province achieved the advanced stage of agricultural cooperation last autumn, and after a year of production practice and rectification, the agricultural cooperatives were further consolidated. The socialist principle of distribution according to work will further encourage the labor enthusiasm of the vast number of members. Due to last year's unprecedented bumper harvest, agricultural cooperatives' production investment this year is greater than in any year in history, which greatly strengthens their confidence in increasing production. Last year, the province launched a large-scale agricultural technology reform movement, which greatly improved the agricultural science and technology knowledge of leading cadres and farmers. Farmers in various places have also created many advanced production experiences.

The person in charge said that the above-mentioned factors, which are extremely beneficial to agricultural production, make it possible for Hubei Province to continue to win victories on the agricultural production front this year. Therefore, the provincial agricultural work conference determined that this year's agricultural production will take another step forward on the basis of last year's unprecedented bumper harvest, with a larger scale and greater increase in production than last year. In order to strive to complete or overfulfill this year's production plan, the province will launch a massive, large-scale production increase movement. Various places will continue to vigorously promote various production increase measures and technological reforms centered on the five production reforms (namely: changing one-season crops to two-season crops or two-season crops to three-season crops, changing dry land to paddy fields, changing to improved varieties, changing low-yield crops to high-yield crops, and changing sloping land to terraced fields) in accordance with local conditions; build farmland water conservancy projects and expand irrigation areas; broaden fertilizer sources and increase fertilizer application; carry out drought prevention, flood prevention, pest and disease prevention, animal epidemic prevention, and bird and animal damage prevention campaigns to overcome natural disasters; comprehensively implement comprehensive technical measures focusing on timely early sowing, appropriate close planting, full seedlings, and strong seedlings; promote new agricultural tools and strengthen the improvement of old agricultural tools. Finally, he emphasized that in order to smoothly launch this year's large-scale production increase movement, in addition to earnestly taking the above-mentioned measures, the key lies in the leadership of leading cadres at all levels. They should go deep into the rural areas, personally take action, starting from strengthening the leadership of the current winter production movement, launch a broad, in-depth, and lasting advanced producer movement on the agricultural production front, mobilize all positive factors, and strive to achieve the 1957 agricultural production increase plan.

### 去年粮棉空前丰收，能不能再跨进一步？  湖北农业战线今年要争取更大胜利  关键在于领导干部深入农村加强领导调动一切积极因素

    去年粮棉空前丰收，能不能再跨进一步？
    湖北农业战线今年要争取更大胜利
    关键在于领导干部深入农村加强领导调动一切积极因素
    新华社武汉21日电　去年获得粮、棉空前丰收的湖北省，今年能不能继续前进，争取更大的丰收？新华社记者就这个问题，访问了湖北省农业部门的负责人。
    这位负责人说，湖北省粮、棉丰收以后，确实有一些人产生了“增产到顶”的思想。近来，各地结合总结过去一年的生产工作，批判了这种思想。最近举行的全省农业工作会议，又着重地对农业增产潜力的问题进行了讨论。得出的结论是：湖北省农业增产的潜力不仅没有挖尽，而且还是很大，增产的各种有利因素不是比以前减少了，而是更多了。他指出，从去年粮食的单位面积产量来看，全省按耕地面积计算，每亩只有四百二十斤，而每亩产七百斤到八百斤的却很多。孝感、黄陂等县全县粮食每亩平均产量都超过了八百斤，全省每亩产一千斤粮食的“千斤社”将近有两千个，有些高额丰产田每亩产量达到了两千斤。去年全省棉花平均每亩产四十四斤皮棉，同时却出现了不少“百斤皮棉乡”和七百多个“百斤皮棉社”。过去棉花单位面积产量最低的襄阳专区，去年产量增加了一倍多。从产量不平衡到平衡，就是很大的增产潜力。他接着说，湖北省发展农业生产的有利因素是：湖北省处在长江、汉水两岸，土地肥沃，气候温和，雨量充沛。过去一年来，由于许多农业社刚刚建成，经营管理的经验不足，对于这些有利的自然条件的利用，受到了一定的限制。今后农业社的经营管理经验逐渐增多，就有可能更加充分地利用它们。全省在去年秋天实现农业高级合作化，而且经过去年一年的生产实践，经过整顿，农业社进一步巩固了。社会主义的按劳分配原则，将更加鼓舞广大社员的劳动积极性。由于去年获得空前丰收，今年农业社的生产投资比历史上任何一年都大，这就大大增强了增产的信心。去年全省开展大规模的农业技术改革运动，使领导干部和农民群众在农业科学技术上有很大提高。各地农民还创造了许多先进的生产经验。
    这位负责人说，上述对农业生产极为有利的因素，就有可能使湖北省在今年农业生产战线上继续获得胜利。因此，全省农业工作会议确定：今年的农业生产将在去年空前丰收的基础上再向前跨进一步，规模比去年更大，增产比去年更多。为争取完成或超额完成今年的生产计划，全省将开展一个规模巨大的大面积增产运动。各地将因地制宜继续大力推行以五项生产改革（即：一季作物改两季作物或两季作物改三季作物、旱地改水田、改用良种、低产作物改高产作物和坡地改梯田）为中心的各项增产措施和技术改革；兴修农田水利，扩大灌溉面积；广辟肥源，增施肥料；开展防旱、防涝、防病虫、防畜疫、防鸟兽害运动，战胜自然灾害；全面贯彻以适时早播、适当密植、全苗和壮苗为主的综合技术措施；推广新式农具，加强对旧式农具的改良工作。最后他强调指出，要使今年的大面积增产运动顺利地开展起来，除认真采取以上各项措施外，关键还在于各级领导干部的领导。他们应当深入农村，亲自动手，从加强当前的冬季生产运动的领导开始，在农业生产战线上开展一个广泛深入的、持久的先进生产者运动，调动一切积极因素，争取实现1957年的农业增产计划。
