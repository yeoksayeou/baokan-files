    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo dispatch: The Japan Socialist Party held its representative congress in Tokyo from the 17th to the 19th. Approximately six hundred people participated in the congress, including Socialist Party Diet members and local representatives.
    The plenary session on the 19th passed the Japan Socialist Party's 1957 action policy with an overwhelming majority. Before its passage, this policy had aroused fierce debate between the left and right factions within the Socialist Party and had undergone many revisions. These revisions are considered a victory for the left wing.
    The policy states that the Socialist Party will never recognize two Chinas and demands that Japan swiftly establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.
    The new policy establishes the principle of demanding the revision and abolition of unequal treaties and considers the American occupation of Okinawa to be "unjust oppression." The congress resolution criticized American foreign policy, accusing the American government of attempting to replace British and French imperialism in the Middle East, and that the United States had adopted a blatant policy at the beginning of this year of attempting to turn the Middle East into a military base to counter the Soviet Union.
    The congress issued a declaration stating that the Japan Socialist Party will "advance towards socialism through democracy" and that it will "overthrow the conservative regime and establish a vigorous Socialist Party regime."
    The congress also passed organizational activity policies, draft amendments to the party charter, and a five-year economic reconstruction plan. This economic plan advocates nationalizing Japan's basic industries and abolishing the "Defense Agency," and taking steps to increase Japan's trade with China, the Soviet Union, other socialist countries, and countries in Asia and Africa.
    The congress re-elected the leading cadres of the Japan Socialist Party, with most of them being re-elected. Mosaburo Suzuki was re-elected as Chairman of the Central Executive Committee, Inejiro Asanuma was re-elected as Secretary-General, Hiroo Wada was elected as Chairman of the Policy Deliberation Council, and Kanemitsu Hosako was elected as Chairman of the Diet Countermeasures Committee. The congress also elected forty members of the Central Executive Committee. According to a Socialist Party spokesperson, representatives of the former left wing hold a majority in the new Central Executive Committee.

    日社会党代表大会
    主张修改和废除不平等条约
    并要求政府迅速同中国建立外交关系
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本社会党从17日至19日在东京举行代表大会。参加大会的有社会党国会议员和地方代表约六百多人。
    19日的全体会议以压倒多数通过了社会党1957年的运动方针。这个方针在通过以前曾经引起社会党内部左右两派势力的激烈争辩，并且作了许多修改。这些修改被认为是左派的胜利。
    这个方针说，社会党决不承认两个中国，要求日本迅速同中华人民共和国建立外交关系。
    新的方针确定了要求修改和废除不平等条约的原则，并且认为美国占领冲绳是“不正当的压迫”。大会决议抨击了美国的外交政策，指责美国政府企图在中东代替英法帝国主义，美国在今年年初采取了一种明目张胆的试图把中东变为一个对付苏联的军事基地的政策。
    大会发表宣言声明，日本社会党要“通过民主主义走向社会主义”，它要“打倒保守政权，建立富有朝气的社会党政权”。
    大会还通过了组织活动方针、修改党章草案、五年重建经济计划等。这个经济计划主张把日本的基本工业收归国有和废除“防卫厅”，并且要采取步骤增加日本同中国、苏联和其他社会主义国家以及同亚非国家的贸易。
    大会改选了日本社会党的领导干部，大部分都连任。铃木茂三郎连任中央执行委员会委员长，浅沼稻次郎连任书记长，和田博雄当选政策审议会会长，细迫兼光当选国会对策委员会委员长。大会还选出了中央执行委员会的四十名委员。据社会党发言人说，在新的中央执行委员会中，前左派代表占多数。
