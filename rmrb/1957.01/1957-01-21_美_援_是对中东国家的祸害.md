U.S. "Aid" is a Scourge to Middle Eastern Countries
	Lin Xin

	Recently, the United States announced the "Eisenhower Doctrine," attempting, on the one hand, to more brutally suppress the national independence movements in Middle Eastern countries, and on the other hand, to more effectively seize the colonial interests of Britain and France in the Middle East and North Africa. However, in this era, the United States also realizes that simply using force to promote colonial policies is somewhat dangerous and unfavorable to the United States. Therefore, in addition to declaring the use of force in the Middle East, the "Eisenhower Doctrine" also emphasizes the so-called "aid" to Middle Eastern countries, wanting to use U.S. "aid" as bait, and after the Middle Eastern countries take the bait, use the big stick to beat them.

	So, what is U.S. "aid" all about? What has it actually done in the Middle East in the past? After understanding these things, it will not be difficult for people to see what the "military aid" and "economic aid" announced in the "Eisenhower Doctrine" really are.

	U.S. "aid" is divided into two types: military "aid" and economic and technical "aid." The vast majority of foreign aid funds allocated by the U.S. Congress are military "aid," that is, used to supply U.S. weapons and military engineering equipment, and to support the military economy of the recipient countries. U.S. military "aid" is attached to a series of enslaving military, political, and economic conditions. These conditions were first stipulated in the "Mutual Security Act" passed by the U.S. Congress, and then forced upon recipient countries through "bilateral agreements" concluded between the United States and the recipient countries.

	Currently, the Middle Eastern countries that receive U.S. military "aid" are Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan. At the same time, Turkey also received "economic aid" from the "Marshall Plan," and Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan also received "technical aid" from Truman's "Point Four Program." The amount of economic and technical aid is pitifully small compared to the amount of military aid. In fact, even these small amounts of economic and technical aid are not used to meet the economic needs of the recipient countries, but are basically still used for military purposes.

	The conditions of U.S. military aid are all colonial in nature, because this kind of aid forces the recipient countries to undertake a series of obligations that harm their national sovereignty and independence.

	According to the U.S. "Mutual Security Act," U.S. military aid is only used to strengthen U.S. "security," that is, to realize U.S. military strategic plans. The "bilateral agreements" stipulate that the recipient countries should effectively participate in the "collective security system," that is, various military aggression groups organized by the United States. In the Middle East region, Turkey participated in the North Atlantic Aggression Group, Pakistan participated in the Southeast Asia Aggression Group, and Turkey, Pakistan, Iraq, and Iran all joined the Baghdad Aggression Group. According to the Tehran "Ettela'at" newspaper, when Iran's ruling group was unwilling to quickly decide to participate in the Baghdad Pact, the United States even issued an ultimatum to Iran, saying that if Iran refused to join the Baghdad Pact, then the United States would cancel its "financial, technical and military assistance" to Iran and remove it from the list of "friends."

	Accepting U.S. "aid" requires providing cannon fodder for the United States. According to the "bilateral agreements," the recipient countries must "make full contributions to the development and maintenance of their own defense forces and the defense forces of the free world." In order to make this kind of "contribution," Turkey, from 1948 to 1954, allocated as much as three billion Turkish pounds to the military authorities alone, that is, direct military appropriations. This amount exceeds the "Marshall Plan" and "Mutual Security Act" allocations to Turkey during the same period by one time. According to the Turkish "Halkci" newspaper on March 18, 1955, Turkey has one division of troops per million people. If calculated by population, Turkey maintains more troops than any country in the North Atlantic Group. A report by a special delegation of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee published in 1956 also acknowledged that since 1945, Turkey's annual military expenditure has reached more than 40% of its budget, which "is unaffordable for the country's economy." The report also pointed out that the consequences of Turkey's economic militarization are inflation, high prices, and reduced foreign exchange reserves. Before Iran joined the Baghdad Pact, an unnamed advisor to the Iranian government on foreign policy issues told a reporter from the "Tehran Post" that Iran now "spends 60% of its budget on the army. ... Once it joins the Baghdad Pact, Iran will have to use its entire budget and oil revenues for the army."

	The "bilateral agreements" stipulate that these "aid" shall not be used for non-military purposes without the approval of the U.S. government; the United States "has the right to supervise the use of the aid provided under the agreement." This obligation requires the recipient countries to support a large number of U.S. military advisors, experts, and observers, etc. It is said that Turkey alone has more than five thousand U.S. military personnel. The Tehran "Ettela'at" reported on September 24, 1955, that there were more than 650 American military advisors in Iran. They often interfere in the internal affairs of these countries. Their high salaries add to the financial burden of these countries. For example, in Thailand, although there are fewer American military advisors than in Turkey, the cost of maintaining this group of American personnel is still more than the expenses of the Thai government to maintain six ministries, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of Cooperatives.

	The "bilateral agreements" also stipulate that the recipient countries must "cooperate" with the United States in terms of "trade control measures," that is, prohibit them from trading with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. It also stipulates that the import of goods from the United States, or the export of strategic materials from the recipient countries by the United States, should be "exempt from tariff treatment and exempt from domestic taxes." These obligations deepen the recipient countries' harmful dependence on the United States economically, so that the United States can sell its goods at high prices and buy the raw materials of the recipient countries at low prices as it pleases. The commodities imported by Turkey from the United States and other Western countries are 40% more expensive than the world market price, but the raw materials exported are far below the world market price.

	According to the "bilateral agreements," the recipient countries must strive to produce "raw materials and semi-finished products that are lacking or may be lacking in American resources" and transfer them to the United States at low prices. Since the United States prohibits countries receiving military aid from trading so-called strategic materials with socialist countries, the United States can transport the raw materials of these countries away at the lowest prices (such as Turkey's chromium, manganese, and copper ore). In this way, the United States not only recovers all the capital of "aid," but simply plunders the wealth of these countries under the guise of "aid." After the war, in order to supply the United States with strategic materials, Turkey had rapid development in the mining industry, but many other industrial enterprises went bankrupt under U.S. "aid." According to former Turkish Labor Minister Barlas, the implementation of the "Marshall Plan" in Turkey resulted in the closure of 412 industrial enterprises in Turkey. The oil in Iran and Iraq is of course a resource that the United States "lacks or may lack," but unfortunately, a considerable part of it is under British plunder. The United States is using "aid" and other methods to seize the oil resources controlled by Britain.

	Middle Eastern countries such as Afghanistan, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia, which refused to participate in aggression groups and refused to accept U.S. military "aid," once accepted "technical aid" from Truman's "Point Four Program." Fearing the opposition of Arab countries, the United States dared not give Israel formal military "aid," so Israel nominally only accepted "technical aid" from the "Point Four Program" and other U.S. financial assistance.

	Truman said that the "Point Four Program" was to "improve the living standards of people in backward countries." In fact, this is a blatant lie. Washington officials once undisguisedly admitted that the United States gave these countries economic and technical "aid" in order to prepare them to be pulled into the U.S. group, or to deal with the special circumstances of some countries. In short, this kind of aid was used to replace military "aid." Former "Marshall Plan" implementer Hoffman once said: "Military aid and economic aid are basically the same. ... Both are actually economic aid, but both are mainly for a military purpose." After the Point Four Program was incorporated into the "Mutual Security Act" in 1951, as the U.S. "New Republic" weekly said, the Point Four Program put on a military uniform. But the funds allocated by the United States for this kind of "aid" were much less than the overt military "aid."

	Although the bilateral agreements signed by the United States with countries receiving "Point Four Program" aid did not include those openly enslaving clauses stipulated in the military "aid" agreements, this kind of aid was still colonial in nature, and it opened the door for the intrusion of American capital and commodities. According to the bilateral agreements, technical assistance includes two main aspects: the "assistance" of experts and the "assistance" of finance.

	The "assistance" of experts is to have the U.S. government send a large number of "experts" to the mining, agriculture, forestry, transportation, medical and health, and cultural and educational departments of the recipient countries to serve as consultants. These "experts" enjoy full diplomatic privileges. Their actual task is to collect military, political, and economic intelligence of the recipient countries. In the Middle East, they pay special attention to oil resource intelligence in order to ensure that the United States can seize new oil exploration and mining rights. They not only interfere in the internal affairs of the recipient countries, but also carry out espionage activities. At the meeting of the Lebanese parliament on December 1, 1953, many parliamentarians exposed the fact that American "experts" were engaged in conspiracy activities. Parliamentarian Ajib Furzli said: The American personnel implementing the "Point Four Program" have gone beyond the scope of "assistance" and are conducting "espionage reconnaissance activities." He also discovered that the "Point Four Program" agency in Lebanon built underground supply depots for storing weapons and ammunition in the Tourbal district in order to carry out sabotage activities. The Egyptian "People's Daily" revealed on July 24, 1956, that the American experts who implemented the "Point Four Program" aid in Egypt were actually spies, and they were a serious danger to Egypt's independence.

	The "assistance" of finance is the provision of a small amount of "technical cooperation funds" by the United States. But it does not give money, but buys goods in the United States, so Truman said: "The Point Four Program" is "a good deal" for the United States. The recipient countries cannot get this fund unconditionally for nothing, and they must set up a "special development fund" themselves. Usually, the money allocated by the recipient countries themselves is more than the American assistance. According to the "bilateral agreements," the use of these two funds must be approved by the U.S. government representative implementing the "Point Four Program." In this way, the United States controls the finances and budget of the recipient countries. The more aid the United States provides, the tighter the control.

	These U.S. government representatives who implement the "Point Four Program" first decide to use these funds for purposes that meet U.S. military purposes, such as mining rare metals and other strategic raw materials, building strategic highways, and even building gendarmerie outposts in countries like Iran. Secondly, it is used for digging wells, building water conservancy projects, preventing pests, eradicating malaria, and building toilets. As for the allocation of funds involving industrial development, it is negligible. Obviously, the United States is unwilling to see the development of industry in Middle Eastern countries, and attempts to keep them forever in the position of sales markets for American industrial products and raw material producing areas, so as to become a source for the United States to extract huge profits. The Middle Eastern countries have not built a large factory under the U.S. "aid" after so many years of U.S. "aid." On the contrary, under the technical "assistance" of the United States, the economic situation of Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, and other countries has deteriorated.

	U.S. "aid" not only did not promote industrial development in Middle Eastern countries, but also played a destructive role in agricultural production. From 1953, the U.S. Congress added a new clause to the "Mutual Security Act." This new clause requires the U.S. government to use "aid" to promote the sale of "surplus" agricultural products. Most of these "surplus" agricultural products are shipped to Asia, especially the Middle East and Southeast Asia. The United States forced these countries to accept "surplus" grains, cotton, and tobacco. Even for cotton-producing countries such as Pakistan, which already felt that cotton sales were sluggish, the United States forced it to accept "aid" of "surplus" cotton. The result of the United States dumping surplus cotton on the world market has made Egypt lose its traditional major cotton sales market and increased the difficulty of Egypt's cotton exports.

	U.S. "aid" cannot promote industrial development, nor can it improve agricultural production, but it has become a tool for the United States to blackmail recipient countries. According to the 1951 "Mutual Security Act," whether it is military aid or economic and technical aid, as long as the U.S. President determines that providing these aid is no longer in line with "the interests and security of the United States," the provision of all or part of the aid will be stopped immediately. The United States has often threatened recipient countries with stopping "aid." The U.S. withdrawal of its proposal to aid Egypt in the construction of the Aswan High Dam proves that U.S. "aid" is by no means to help Middle Eastern countries build, but to achieve its ulterior motives.

	The U.S. military and economic and technical "aid" appropriations to Middle Eastern countries are simply a drop in the bucket compared to the profits it earns from unequal trade with the Middle East and the plunder of oil from the Middle East. However, the United States, this cruel plunderer, still shamelessly talks about its "aid" to Middle Eastern countries!

    美“援”是对中东国家的祸害
    林欣
    最近，美国宣布了“艾森豪威尔主义”，企图一方面更野蛮地镇压中东国家的民族独立运动，另一方面更有效地夺取英法在中东和北非的殖民利益。但是，在我们这个时代里，美国也意识到：单纯用武力推行殖民政策是有点危险的，对美国是不利的。因此，“艾森豪威尔主义”除了宣布在中东使用武力以外，还强调要对中东国家实行所谓“援助”，想用美“援”来做诱饵，等中东国家上钩以后，再用大棒来揍它们。
    那末，美“援”是怎么回事？它过去在中东究竟做了些什么？了解了这些之后，人们就不难看出“艾森豪威尔主义”中所宣布的“军事援助”和“经济援助”到底是什么货色了。
    美“援”分军事“援助”和经济技术“援助”两种。美国国会所拨出的援外款项绝大部分是军事“援助”，也就是说用来供应美国的武器和军事工程的装备，以及支持受援国的军事经济。美国的军事“援助”附有一系列军事、政治和经济的奴役性的条件。这些条件最先规定在美国国会通过的“共同安全法”中，然后通过美国和受援国缔结的“双边协定”，迫使后者接受。
    现在接受美国军事“援助”的中东国家有土耳其、伊朗、伊拉克和巴基斯坦。同时土耳其还接受了“马歇尔计划”的“经济援助”，伊朗、伊拉克和巴基斯坦还接受过杜鲁门“第四点计划”的“技术援助”。经济技术援助的数目比起军事援助的数目是少得可怜。其实就连这些少量的经济技术援助也不是用来满足受援国的经济需要，基本上仍然是用于军事的目的。
    美国军事援助的条件都是具有殖民主义性质的，因为这种援助迫使受援国承担一系列损害它们国家主权和独立的义务。
    根据美国“共同安全法”，美国的军事援助只是用来加强美国的“安全”，也就是说用来实现美国的军事战略计划。在“双边协定”中规定，受援国应该有效地参加“集体安全体系”，即美国组织的各种军事侵略集团。在中东地区，土耳其参加了北大西洋侵略集团，巴基斯坦参加了东南亚侵略集团，土耳其、巴基斯坦、伊拉克和伊朗都加入了巴格达侵略集团。据德黑兰“知识报”报道：当伊朗的统治集团不愿意很快就决定参加巴格达条约的时候，美国甚至向伊朗提出最后通牒说，如果伊朗拒绝参加巴格达条约，那末美国就将取消对伊朗的“财政、技术和军事援助”，并把它从“朋友”的名单上勾掉。
    接受美“援”必须为美国提供炮灰。根据“双边协定”，受援国必须“对其自身的防御力量和自由世界的防御力量的发展和维持作充分贡献”。为了作出这种“贡献”，土耳其从1948年到1954年这段时间内，仅仅拨给军事主管机关的款项，即直接军事拨款就达三十亿土镑。这个数目超过了同时期“马歇尔计划”和“共同安全法”给土耳其拨款的一倍。据1955年3月18日土耳其“哈尔克西报”统计，土耳其每百万人口就有一师军队，如果按人口计算，土耳其维持的军队，比北大西洋集团的任何一个国家的军队要多。1956年美国众议院外交委员会发表的一个特别代表团的报告书也承认：自从1945年以来，土耳其每年的军费开支已达到占它的预算的40％以上，而这“是该国经济所不能负担的”。这个报告书还指出，土耳其经济军事化的后果是通货膨胀、物价高涨和外汇储备减少。在伊朗参加巴格达条约以前，一个不愿说出自己姓名的伊朗政府外交政策问题的顾问对“德黑兰邮报”的记者说，现在伊朗“预算的60％是用于军队。……一旦加入巴格达条约，伊朗将不得不把它的整个预算以及石油收入用于军队”。
    “双边协定”规定：未经美国政府批准，不得将这些“援助”用于非军事的目的；美国“有权监督根据协定所给予的援助的使用情况”。这种义务使受援国家要养活一大批的美国军事顾问、专家和观察员等等。据说仅土耳其一国就有五千多名美国军事人员。1955年9月24日德黑兰“知识报”报道，在伊朗的美国军事顾问在六百五十名以上。他们经常干涉这些国家的内政。他们的高额薪金加重了这些国家的财政负担。例如在泰国，美国的军事顾问虽比在土耳其的要少，但维持这批美国人员的开支，仍然比泰国政府维持外交部、文化部、工业部、财政部、司法部和合作社部等六个部的费用还要多。
    “双边协定”还规定，受援国必须在“管制贸易措施”方面同美国“合作”，也就是说禁止它们同苏联和人民民主国家进行贸易。它还规定从美国输入货物，或者美国从受援国运出战略原料应该“免除关税待遇并豁免国内税”。这些义务就加深了受援国的经济对美国的有害依赖，从而使美国能称心如意地以高价售卖它的商品和低价购买受援国的原料。土耳其从美国等西方国家输入的商品比世界市场价格贵40％，但是输出的原料却远远低于世界市场的价格。
    根据“双边协定”，受援国必须努力生产“美国资源中缺乏或可能缺乏的原料和半制品”，并以低价转让给美国。由于美国禁止接受军事援助的国家同社会主义国家进行所谓战略物资的贸易，美国就能以最低的价格把这些国家的原料运走（例如土耳其的铬、锰、铜矿砂就是这样）。这样，美国不仅把“援助”的老本都捞回去了，而且简直是打着“援助”的幌子掠夺这些国家的财富。战后土耳其为了供应美国战略原料，在采矿工业方面有了迅速发展，但是许多其他的工业企业则在美国“援助”下破产了。据前土耳其劳工部长巴尔拉斯承认，在土耳其执行“马歇尔计划”的结果，使土耳其国内四百一十二家工业企业倒闭了。伊朗和伊拉克的石油当然是美国所“缺乏或可能缺乏”的资源，不过，可惜的是有相当大的部分在英国掠夺之下。美国正利用“援助”和其他方法来夺取英国所控制的石油资源。
    阿富汗、埃及、约旦、黎巴嫩和沙特阿拉伯等拒绝参加侵略集团并拒绝接受美国军事“援助”的中东国家，曾经接受了杜鲁门“第四点计划”的“技术援助”。由于害怕阿拉伯国家的反对，美国未敢给以色列以正式的军事“援助”，所以以色列在名义上也只接受“第四点计划”的“技术援助”和美国的其他财政援助。
    杜鲁门说，“第四点计划”是要“提高落后国家人民的生活水平”。其实这是漫天大谎。华盛顿的官员们曾经毫不隐讳地承认，美国给这些国家以经济技术“援助”，是为了把它们拉入美国集团作一些准备工作，或者对付一些国家的特殊情况，总之这种援助是用来代替军事“援助”的。前“马歇尔计划”执行人霍夫曼曾经说过：“军事援助和经济援助在基本上是一样的。……两者实际上都是经济援助，但两者主要地都是为了一个军事目的。”1951年当第四点计划并入“共同安全法”之后，正如美国“新共和”周刊所说的，第四点计划便穿上了军装。但是美国拨给这种“援助”的款项则比公开的军事“援助”要少得多。
    虽然美国同接受“第四点计划”援助的国家签订的双边协定，不包括军事“援助”协定中所规定的那些公开的奴役性的条款；但是这种援助仍然是殖民主义性质的，它为美国资本和商品的入侵打开了方便之门。根据双边协定，技术援助包括两个主要方面：专家的“援助”和财政的“援助”。
    专家的“援助”，就是由美国政府派遣大批“专家”到受援国的矿务、农林、交通运输、医药卫生和文化教育等等部门中去充当顾问。这些“专家”都享有充分的外交特权。他们的实际任务是搜集受援国的军事、政治和经济的情报。在中东，他们特别注意石油资源的情报，以便保证美国能攫取新的石油勘探权和开采权。他们不仅干涉受援国的内政，而且还进行特务间谍活动。在黎巴嫩议会1953年12月1日会议上，许多议员揭发了美国“专家”从事阴谋活动的事实。议员阿吉布·弗尔兹利说：执行“第四点计划”的美国人员，已越出了“援助”的范围，进行“间谍侦察活动”了。他还发现，在黎巴嫩的“第四点计划”机构为了进行破坏活动，在土尔包尔区建筑了储藏武器弹药的地下军需库。1956年7月24日埃及“人民报”揭露说，在埃及执行“第四点计划”援助的美国专家实际上是间谍，他们对埃及的独立是一种严重的危险。
    财政的“援助”，就是由美国提供一项数目不多的“技术合作基金”。但不是给钱，而是在美国购买货物，所以杜鲁门说：“第四点计划”对美国来说“是很好的买卖”。受援国并不能无条件白得这笔基金，它自己必须设立一项“特别开发基金”。通常是受援国自己拨出的钱比美国援助的还要多。根据“双边协定”，这两项基金的动用都要经执行“第四点计划”的美国政府代表的批准。这样，美国就控制了受援国的财政和预算。美国援助得愈多就控制得愈厉害。
    这些执行“第四点计划”的美国政府代表，首先决定把这些基金用于符合美国军事目的的用途，例如开采稀有金属等战略原料、修筑战略公路，甚至在伊朗那样用来建筑宪兵岗哨。其次是用于挖井、修水利、防止虫害、扑灭疟疾、盖造厕所等等。至于涉及工业发展方面的拨款，则是微不足道的。显然，美国是不愿意看到中东国家发展工业的，并且企图使它们永远处于美国工业品的销售市场和原料产地的地位，以便成为美国榨取巨额利润的一个源泉。美国“援助”了这么些年，中东国家没有在美国“援助”下建成一个大工厂。相反，土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦等国在美国的技术“援助”之下，经济情况每况愈下。
    美“援”不仅没有促进中东国家的工业发展，相反还对农业生产起了破坏作用。从1953年起，美国国会给“共同安全法”增加了一个新条款。这个新条款要求美国政府用“援助”来推销“剩余”农产品。这些“剩余”农产品大部分被运往亚洲，特别是中东和东南亚各国。美国迫使这些国家接受“剩余”的粮食、棉花和烟草等。甚至对巴基斯坦那样已经感到棉花滞销的产棉国，美国还强迫它接受“剩余”棉花的“援助”。美国在世界市场倾销剩余棉花的结果，使埃及失去了传统的主要棉花销售市场，增加了埃及棉花外销的困难。
    美“援”既不能促进工业发展，也不能提高农业生产，但是它却成为美国讹诈受援国的工具。根据1951年“共同安全法”，不论是军事援助还是经济技术援助，只要美国总统断定提供这些援助不再符合“美国的利益和安全”的时候，立即停止提供援助的全部或一部。美国曾经时常以停止“援助”来威胁受援国家。美国撤回关于援助埃及修建阿斯旺高水坝的建议，就证明美“援”决不是为了帮助中东国家建设，而是为了达到它不可告人的目的。
    美国给中东国家的军事和经济技术“援助”的拨款，比起它同中东进行不等价贸易和从中东掠夺石油而捞去的利润来，简直是沧海一粟。可是，美国这个残酷的掠夺者居然还厚着脸皮向中东国家大谈其“援助”哩！
