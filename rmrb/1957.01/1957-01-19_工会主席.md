    Chairman of the Trade Union
    Cao Baoming
    Two months ago, I ran into Old Sun in the park. He used to be the chairman of the trade union when I was reporting from the iron mine. The several section chiefs with him were all wearing gabardine or fine wool uniforms, but he was still in his blue cotton-padded clothes.
    Section Chief Liu, who loves to joke, said as soon as he saw me: "Don't think he looks so shabby. He's our big tycoon! He and his wife earn more than two hundred yuan a month, and they can't even spend it all. The coarse woolen uniform the company gave him is still kept, and he only wears it to meetings."
    Old Sun's wife immediately retorted: "Talk about savings, it's good enough if we don't run into debt!"
    I had spent more than a year with Old Sun and knew his temperament. At that time, he was still single and earned more than one hundred yuan a month. Every month after payday, some workers would come to him to talk about their financial difficulties. If some of the requests could not be covered by the regulations, he would take out his wage packet and "lend" ten or five yuan to the workers. As a result, he had little left each month except for buying books and newspapers. I wasn't familiar with his wife, so I didn't know if she was complaining or praising him. I couldn't help but smile and say, "Still the same old ways." Old Sun blushed when he heard this and said awkwardly, "No, no, this cotton-padded coat is warm and comfortable!..."
    This meeting reminded me of two things that happened to him in the past.
    Once, the workers raised many opinions with the leadership about their living conditions. The workers of the First Mine said: "There is a 'Dragon Beard Ditch' in Beijing, and we also have a 'Dragon Beard Ditch' in our dormitory area. The 'Dragon Beard Ditch' in Beijing has been turned into gardens and boulevards, but our 'Dragon Beard Ditch' is still the same old way, the pond in front of the door is dirty and smelly. We fight ore during the day and fight planes (mosquitoes) and tanks (bedbugs) at night." Later, Old Sun went to the residential area for an inspection and said to everyone: "The masses' criticism is very correct. In the past, we only mobilized the masses to do a good job in production and regarded these problems as trivial matters of life and did not pay close attention to solving them." Then he said: "I hope the workers will supervise the trade union to handle these things well in the future." The workers were very satisfied with his self-criticism. An old worker said: "Chairman Sun cares about our lives and will definitely become a big cadre in the future!"
    Who knew that a small problem would arise: A worker went to the branch trade union to ask for a house. Because there were many people and few houses, the trade union cadre said there was no way to solve it. He pointed at the cadre's nose and scolded: "What did Chairman Sun say? You, you are still so bureaucratic!" When the comrades of the branch heard about this, without even asking whether Old Sun had not explained it fully or whether the worker had misunderstood the meaning, they immediately got angry: "Who can't shout communism? Who can't buy favor with the masses? Okay, he can talk, let him come and solve it!" Later, at a Party meeting, the branch secretary brought up this matter again and said: "The workers all say that Chairman Sun will become a big cadre in the future, we bureaucrats are really useless!" Causing a burst of laughter. The Party committee secretary looked up at Old Sun, who immediately blushed and lowered his head to concentrate on taking notes. I also attended that meeting, and at that time, I felt very unfair for him. I had heard his speech, he had made it clear which problems could be solved but had not been solved, and which problems were difficult to solve temporarily. How could it be his fault that individual workers misunderstood his speech? However, he did not stand up to defend his correct opinion, which I found very strange.
    That night, it was almost eleven o'clock, and I saw that the light in his small room was still on, so I pushed the door open and saw him engrossed in reading at the table. He was reading "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, and Pay Attention to Methods of Work", with many red circles and dots drawn between the lines. When he saw me, he smiled and said: "It's really not easy to rely on the masses and implement the policy of the mass line. Although my speech that day was correct, there was still a problem. Before the speech, I did not unify the thinking among the cadres and turn the correct opinion into the opinion of the whole Party, and as a result, it was not the comrades who were less concerned about the lives of the masses who were isolated, but myself. Originally, I only intended to ask the administration to spend money to solve these problems, and did not consider mobilizing the masses to solve the problems that they could solve themselves. So the Party committee secretary said that although I had a good heart to solve the problem, I was a 'half-baked mass line'. ... Now, I am thinking of organizing workers for voluntary labor this Sunday to clean up the environmental hygiene of the dormitory. I don't know if it will work."
    On Sunday, Old Sun led some cadres and workers to work around the dormitory. Some shoveled soil, some filled ponds, and nurses in white clothes also sprayed "DDT" indoors. It was a lively scene. In less than a day, the pond was filled, and the dormitory was cleaned up. At this time, Old Sun rubbed the mud on his hands and walked around, saying: "This is just like helping farmers with production in the past, it's really interesting."
    On another occasion, one night, a worker from the First Mine was injured. As soon as Old Sun received the call, he rushed to the hospital, not even bothering to button his clothes. At that time, the worker needed a blood transfusion immediately. Several workers volunteered, but their blood types were not compatible, which worried the branch secretary. After Old Sun learned about this, he said to the doctor, "Check mine." He immediately gave the injured person 300 cc of blood. The next day, the Party committee heard about this and instructed the trade union to send him some maintenance expenses, but he refused to accept them. He said: "I can't spend all my money, keep this money for other uses!" Later, several reporters also heard about this and ran to talk to him about the situation at that time. They ran around several places but couldn't find him. They finally found him at the pithead, but he blushed and said: "Some people think that if you donate blood, your body will be deficient, but that's not the case at all. It's nothing. Besides, we didn't do a good job in labor protection, that's why the accident happened...".

    工会主席
    曹葆铭
    两个月前，我在公园里碰见老孙。他是我从前在铁矿山采访时的工会主席。和他同行的几个科长都是穿的华达呢或细毛呢制服，唯独他还是穿的一身蓝布棉衣。
    爱开玩笑的刘科长一见面就说：“你别看他穿的这么寒呛，他可是我们的大财主！两口子一个月挣两百多块，三个人花也花不完呢。公家发给他的那套粗呢制服，他还保存着，要开会才穿。”
    老孙的爱人马上分辩道：“还说存款呢，不拉饥荒就是好的！”
    我跟老孙相处过一年多，知道他的脾气。那时，他还是光身汉，一月挣一百多元。每月一关饷，有的工人来找他谈生活困难，他见有的在制度上不能开支，便掏出工资袋来，十元五元的“借”给工人。这样，除了买书报外，他每月所剩就不多了。我跟他爱人不熟，不知她是在嗔他呢，还是在夸他。我忍不住笑着说道：“还是老脾气。”老孙一听我这句话就脸红了，很不自然地说：“那里，那里，我这身棉袄，又暖和，又舒服！……”
    这次见面，使我想起他过去的两件事情。
    有一次，职工们为生活问题给领导上提了许多意见，第一分矿的工人说：“北京有个龙须沟，我们宿舍也有个龙须沟。北京的龙须沟已经变成了花园、大马路，我们的龙须沟还是老样子，门前的水塘又脏又臭。我们白天同矿石作战，夜里同飞机（蚊子）、坦克（臭虫）作战。”后来老孙就到住宅区去检查了一遍，并向大伙说：“群众批评的很对。我们过去就是光发动群众搞好生产，把这些问题都当做生活小事，没有抓紧解决。”接着又说：“希望工人们以后监督工会办好这些事情。”他这样一检讨，工人们都很满意，有个老工人说：“孙主席关心我们生活，将来一定要做大干部！”
    谁知接着就出了个小岔子：有个工人找分矿工会要房子，因为人多房子少，工会干事说没法解决。他就指着这个干事的鼻子骂道：“孙主席是咋讲的？你呀你，你还这么官僚主义！”分矿支部的同志一听说这事，也没问清是老孙讲的不全面呢，还是这个工人将意思领会错了，顿时就火了：“空喊共产主义，谁不会喊？谁不会向群众买好？好吧，他会讲，叫他来解决！”后来在一次党的会议上，支部书记又提起这事说：“工人都说孙主席将来要做大干部，我们这批官僚主义者真不行！”逗得一阵哄笑。党委书记抬起头来望了老孙一眼，老孙立时就满脸通红，很不自然地低着头只顾作记录。那次会我也参加了，当时，我心里很为他不平。我听过他的讲话，他对哪些是可以解决而没有解决的问题，哪些是暂时很难解决的问题，是说清楚了的，个别工人对他的讲话有误解，怎么能算在他头上呢？但是，他并没有站起来为自己的正确的意见辩护，我很奇怪。
    那天夜晚，快十一点钟了，我见他小屋里的灯还亮着，便顺手推门进去，见他正在桌旁专心读书。他读的是“毛泽东选集”里的“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”，字里行间还画了许多红圈点。他一见我，就笑了笑说：“要依靠群众，贯彻群众路线的方针，真不简单啊。我那天的讲话虽然是正确的，但是，还出了岔儿。在讲话之前，我没有在干部中把思想闹一致，把正确的意见变为全党的意见，结果被孤立的不是关心群众生活差的同志，而是我自己。原来我只打算叫行政上出钱来解决这些问题，没考虑发动群众来解决自己可以解决的问题。所以党委书记说我虽然怀着一付好心肠想解决问题，但却是个‘半拉子群众路线’。……现在，我想在这个星期天组织工人义务劳动，打扫宿舍的环境卫生，不知能不能行得通？”
    星期天，老孙领着一些干部和工人在宿舍周围干开了，大家铲土的铲土，填塘的填塘，穿着白衣服的护士还在室内喷射“滴滴涕”，干的挺红火。不到一天功夫，水塘填平了，宿舍也打扫的一干二净。老孙这时一边搓着手上的泥巴，一边走着说：“这就跟从前帮助农民生产一样，真有意思。”
    又有一次，在一个深夜里，一分矿有个工人受伤了。老孙一接到电话，忙得连衣服扣子也顾不上扣，就往医院跑。当时，这个工人需要马上输血，有好几个工人自动报名，但血型都不对，把支部书记愁得直搔头。老孙问清这个情况，便向医生说：“验验我的。”马上给伤员输了三百西西血。第二天，党委听说这事，便指示工会送了笔保养费给他，但他不肯收。他说：“我的钱用不完，把这钱留着作别的用吧！”后来，几个记者也听到这事，都跑去找他谈当时的情形，跑了几个地方都找不着他，好容易在坑口上找着他了，他却红着脸说：“有的人以为输了血，身体就亏了，其实完全不是那么回事。没什么。再说，我们劳动保护工作没做好，才出了事故……”。
