    The Struggle to Transform the Desert—A Visit to Egypt's Liberation Province
    By Our Correspondent Jiang Yuanchun

    It is said that thousands of years ago, the Nile River did not have only two tributaries flowing into the sea as it does now. At that time, there were seven tributaries in the Nile Delta, forming many lakes in the area near the sea. The pharaohs of ancient Egypt, in order to transform these lakes into arable land, cut off five of the seven tributaries of the Nile, leaving only the current two. As a result, a large amount of arable land was obtained near the sea, but at the same time, many fertile fields that were once irrigated by the Nile River gradually became deserts.
    It is said that the Liberation Province, where the Egyptian government is currently undertaking the work of transforming the desert into arable land, used to be the place where one of the Nile River's tributaries flowed. Fossilized bones of the ancient animal Mammoth have been discovered here, proving that life existed here in the past.
    The Liberation Province is located northwest of Cairo, bordering the western edge of the Nile Delta. The province is planned to cover an area of 1.4 million feddans (one feddan is equivalent to 6.3 mu in China); it extends from the suburbs of Cairo to near the port of Alexandria. From the map, the relationship between this province and the Nile Delta is like a silkworm cocoon attached to a ginkgo leaf. The vast majority of this province is still a desert, with only some short reeds and tamarisks growing in some places. The Egyptian government plans to turn this desert into arable land within fifteen years. In charge of this huge plan to conquer nature is Major Muhammad Magdi Hassani. He is the governor of the Liberation Province, a chubby, amiable person, and very friendly to the Chinese people.
    There are reasons why the Liberation Province has become the object of the Egyptian government's work to transform the desert and increase arable land. This area has some favorable conditions for carrying out this plan. This area is close to a tributary of the Nile River, making it easy to divert water from the Nile for irrigation. Moreover, exploration has proven that this area has abundant groundwater. The water source is about seven or eight meters below the ground, and wells can be dug to obtain water. The soil in this area does not contain alkali, so there is no need for flushing; it can be cultivated as long as there is water. In addition, this area is close to Cairo and Alexandria, making it easy to obtain support in terms of machinery, talent, and other aspects.
    Currently, 15,000 feddans of land have been reclaimed in the east of this future province. This reclaimed land is closest to the Nile River. It takes about two hours by car from Cairo to Umm Saber, the central village of the reclaimed area. First, take the desert highway directly to Alexandria, and then turn onto the special highway to the Liberation Province. The desert has undulating hills. In some places, the riverbeds of the past can still be faintly identified in the middle of a belt of sand dunes. After turning onto the highway to the Liberation Province, newly planted roadside trees appeared along the road. This seems to be a kind of eucalyptus tree, all still very small, but they have already survived. Soon after crossing a man-made canal, we arrived at Umm Saber.
      “Umm” means mother in Arabic. Umm Saber means "Saber's mother." This is the name of an Egyptian woman who sacrificed herself in the struggle against the British invaders in 1951, and it is now used to name the first village built in the Liberation Province. Here, just like in the city, there are policemen at the intersections managing traffic. The water tower and the minaret of a mosque stand above the village. Rows of bungalows are the villagers' homes. Young men and women walked back and forth on the street, appearing very busy.
    The entire Liberation Province will be divided into eighteen districts, each including eighteen villages and an industrial center. Four villages have already been built, and an industrial center is under construction. Each village will have about 150 farmer households. The village has houses, shops, clinics, tailors' shops, barbershops, public telephones, and mosques. In the first industrial center, cement pipe factories, sewing factories, tractor repair stations, ice-making plants, etc., have been built and put into production. In addition to supplying the needs of the province's construction, the products of these factories are also transported and sold to other places. The workers in the factories are recruited from all over the country.
    The villagers were moved from the Monufia province on the Nile Delta near the Liberation Province, because this province has the highest population density and the farmers have relatively rich farming experience. The immigrants are all married veterans, and the condition is that they must have no more than three children when they are recruited into the Liberation Province, and they must be healthy. After arriving in the Liberation Province, they first go to another village, Omar Shahin, nearby for six months of training. Men, women, and children are trained separately. Men receive technical training in industry or agriculture, according to their experience. Women receive training in household affairs, medical care, and agriculture. The children go to school. In addition to a primary school, this training center also has a secondary technical school, which recruits young people aged 15 to 18 with secondary school education from all over the country to train the technical cadres needed.
    During the six months of training for a group of villagers, excavators dig canals and ditches in the desert, and bulldozers level the undulating desert and build fields for cultivation. At the same time, construction workers are building a new village. These tasks are completed within six months. After the first phase of farmer training is completed, the land they are going to cultivate and the houses they live in are completed, and they move to the new village to settle down.
    After the farmers arrive in the new village, each household will be allocated five feddans of land. The current immigrants arrived last year.
    A truck took us for a tour of the reclaimed area. A large canal running through the entire area has been opened here from a canal east of the Nile River. This canal can currently irrigate 35,000 feddans of land. It is said that when the Aswan High Dam is completed in the future, two large canals running through the entire province will be excavated to supply the needs of the entire province. Currently, in the northwest of the Liberation Province, a team of people is excavating a canal extending in a southeast direction. Fifteen years later, it will meet the current canal developing from east to west somewhere. Many pumping stations have been set up along the excavated canal in order to pump water into smaller branch canals, and then send it to the fields for irrigation. In order to prevent water from seeping from the sandy soil, concrete channels have been made in some places, but most places have not been paved with concrete. Some ditches are currently transporting water. It can be seen that due to the loose soil, if these ditch banks are not protected, the ditch banks may collapse after a long time. In the reclaimed land, especially the newly reclaimed land, there is also a lot of silting of quicksand. Therefore, in my opinion, planting trees along the banks and planting fast-growing grass on the ditch banks to protect the ditch banks seems to be an urgent task. Some wells have also been opened here to utilize groundwater.
    Greenery has appeared everywhere on the reclaimed land. Here, cultivation and land reclamation are all done by machines. Bulldozers flatten a piece of land and pile up embankments about one meter high around it. The ditch between the two embankments can be watered for irrigation at any time. In places that were reclaimed earlier, the pasture grows very well. Large areas of land are planted with citrus, mangoes, and date palm trees. Although they are still young, they are growing well. It is said that mulberry trees are also being tested here. Some land is planted with peas, broad beans, strawberries, and wheat. Some land has been planted with peanuts, rice, and lemongrass, and has now been harvested. The agricultural policy of the Liberation Province is to plant fruits and vegetables on 60% of the land, obviously because these are crops that can obtain higher income. The remaining 20% of the land is planted with wheat and corn, and 20% of the land is planted with pasture. But the planting of cotton is prohibited. It is said that this is because they are afraid that the imperialists will be jealous when they see such a large area of cotton fields.
    The more newly reclaimed the land, the more obvious the phenomenon of insufficient fertility. On a piece of land that was just opened up last year, wheat has been sown, but the germination rate does not seem to be very high, and the growth is not good. The people who accompanied us on the tour said that these wheat crops could not be harvested. The Liberation Province authorities told us that the cost of reclaiming each feddan of land is 210 pounds. Currently, an income of 120 pounds per feddan per year can be obtained from land planted with vegetables, and about 70 pounds can be obtained from land planted with wheat. But this, of course, only refers to land that was reclaimed earlier. Obviously, in the first year or two after the new land is reclaimed, it is necessary to plan for losses, and it is only possible to obtain a surplus after the soil improvement reaches a certain level.
    On a new piece of land, a team of bulldozers is opening up new farmland. New roads and ditches are being extended forward. A new village is being built. The people of the Liberation Province are proud that they have created life in the desert and built a new life. They call their work an invasion of the desert, which is justified. The desert is engaged in a severe struggle with people's will to transform the desert, and people must conquer the desert. The weapons they rely on are water, science, their firm will and tenacious labor.
    The new reclamation area has a power station with a power generation capacity of 3,000 kilowatts, supplying the electricity needed by the entire area. A power station with a power generation capacity of 8,000 kilowatts is currently under construction. This power station will use Chinese machines. However, our foreign trade agency forgot to attach instruction manuals in Arabic or English to this machine, which caused great difficulties for the Egyptian installation workers. They were very happy to see the Chinese and led us to a machine produced by Shanghai Huatong Switch Factory that controls current and voltage, asking us to translate the square Chinese characters on it into English. But we, who do not understand electrical technology, could not help them.
    The Egyptian people are confident in completing this plan to transform the desert. Because, in Egyptian history, there have been many successful examples of conquering the desert. Three thousand years ago, the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Aman Mahat III was the first to use Nile water to open up the Fayoum Province, which still exists today, in the desert east of the Nile River south of Cairo. This land has become a unique oasis in the eastern desert of Egypt. More than ten years ago, a Greek excavated a canal in Gaftwardova, east of Alexandria, and cultivated a large number of fruit trees there, and invaded the desert year after year. Later, due to political reasons, this invasion stopped. The desert west of this land is also within the scope of the planned Liberation Province. When we returned to Cairo from Alexandria, we passed through Gaftwardova and saw that well-growing orchard. On the desert west of this orchard, a plant that looks like wormwood grows endlessly in the yellow sand, and people graze sheep here. This makes us believe that the Egyptian people will complete their plan to conquer the desert and achieve huge achievements far beyond what their predecessors had ever achieved. (Attached picture)

### 改造沙漠的斗争——访埃及解放省

    改造沙漠的斗争——访埃及解放省
    本报记者　蒋元椿
    据说，几千年以前，尼罗河并不是像现在这样只有两条支流入海的。那时候，在尼罗河三角洲上有七条支流，在现在靠海的地方形成了许多湖泊。古埃及的法老王为了变这些湖泊为耕地，切断了尼罗河七条支流中的五条，只剩下现在的两条。结果，在靠海的地方取得了大量的耕地，但是同时，从前有尼罗河水灌溉的许多良田，却渐渐成了沙漠。
    据说，现在埃及政府正在进行的改造沙漠为良田的解放省，从前就是尼罗河的一条支流经过的地方。在这里已经发现了古代动物猛玛的骨头化石，这证明在这里是有生命存在过的。
    解放省在开罗的西北面，紧贴着尼罗河三角洲的西部边缘。全省计划面积为一百四十万菲登（每菲登合中国的6.3亩）；从开罗近郊一直延伸到亚历山大港附近。从地图上看来，这个省同尼罗河三角洲的关系，就像是附在一片银杏叶上的一个蚕茧。这个省的绝大部分地区，现在还是一片沙漠，只在有些地方长着矮矮的莎草和柽柳。埃及政府计划在十五年之内，把这片沙漠变成为良田。负责这个巨大的征服自然计划的是穆罕默德·麦格迪·哈萨尼少校。他是解放省省长，是一个胖胖的、可亲的人，对中国人民非常友好。
    解放省这块地方之所以成为埃及政府进行改造沙漠、增加耕地工作的对象，是有原因的。这里具备着一些有利的条件，来进行这项计划。这一片土地靠近尼罗河的一条支流，便于从尼罗河引水灌溉。而且，勘探的结果，证明这个地区有丰富的地下水。水源离地面约七、八公尺，可以挖井取水。这个地区的土壤不含碱分，用不着经过冲洗，只要有水就可以耕种。此外，这一地区靠近开罗和亚历山大港，便于取得机器、人才等各方面的支援。
    现在，在这个未来的省的东面，已经开垦了一万五千菲登的土地。这片垦地最靠近尼罗河。从开罗到已开垦地区的中心村庄欧姆·萨贝尔，坐汽车要走两小时左右。先走直通亚历山大港的沙漠公路，然后再转上去解放省的专用公路。沙漠中丘岗起伏。有的地方，在一带沙丘中间，还隐约可以辨认出当年的河床。转上通解放省的公路以后，路旁就出现了新栽的行道树。这似乎是一种桉树，都还很小，但是已经成活。不久以后，越过一条人工开掘出来的水渠，我们就到了欧姆·萨贝尔。
      “欧姆”在阿拉伯文中的意思是母亲。欧姆·萨贝尔，就是“萨贝尔妈妈”。这是一位在1951年同英国侵略者作斗争中牺牲的埃及妇女的名字，现在被用来命名这个解放省第一个建成的村庄。这里现在暂时是解放省的行政中心。村里也像城市中一样，路口上有管理交通的警察。水塔和一座清真寺的尖塔，耸立在村庄上面。一列一列的平房，是村民的住屋。街上来来往往地走着青年男女，显得很忙碌的样子。
    整个解放省将被分为十八个区，每个区包括十八个村庄和一个工业中心。现在已经建成了四个村庄，一个工业中心正在继续建筑中。每个村庄将有一百五十户左右的农民。村庄里建筑有住房、商店、门诊所、裁缝铺、理发室、公用电话、清真寺。在第一个工业中心，已经建成并且开工生产的有水泥管厂、缝纫厂、拖拉机修理站、制冰厂等。这些工厂的产品除了供应本省建设需要以外，还运销到外地去。工厂的工人是从全国各地招收来的。
    村民是从靠近解放省的尼罗河三角洲上的蒙那菲亚省移来的，因为这个省的人口最密，农民的耕作经验也比较丰富。移民都是已婚的退伍军人，条件是在被吸收到解放省来时所有的孩子不超过三个，并且身体健康。他们来到解放省以后，先到附近的另一个村庄欧马·夏希恩受训六个月。男、女和孩子分别受训。男子按他们的经验，分别受工业或农业方面的技术训练。妇女受家事、医疗、农业方面的训练。孩子们在学校里上学。这个训练中心除了一所小学以外，还有一所中等技术学校，从全国各地招来中学程度的十五岁到十八岁的青年，培养所需要的技术干部。
    在一批村民受训的六个月期间，挖土机就在沙漠上开掘运河和沟渠，推土机在把起伏的沙漠夷平，筑成田垅，以便耕种。同时，建筑工人正在建筑一个新的村庄。这些工作都在六个月之内完成。一期农民训练完毕，他们要耕种的土地，他们住的房屋，也就都完成了，他们就搬到新村去定居。
    农民在到达新村以后，将被分给每户五个菲登的土地。现在的移民是去年才到达的。
    一辆卡车载着我们在已垦地区走了一转。这里已经从尼罗河东面的一条运河开了一条纵贯全区的大水渠。这条水渠目前可以灌溉三万五千菲登土地。据说，等将来阿斯旺高水坝建成之后，这里将挖掘两条纵贯全省的大水渠，供应全省所需。现在在解放省的西北部，已经有一队人在开掘一条向东南方向延伸的运河。十五年后，它将同目前由东向西发展的这条运河在某处会合。沿着已掘成的水渠设了许多抽水站，以便把水抽到较小的支渠里去，然后送到地里去灌溉。为了防止水从沙土中渗透，有些地方作了水泥的沟道，但是大多数地方并没有敷设水泥。有些水沟里正在输送水。可以看出，由于土质很松，如果不设法防护这些沟岸，日久以后，沟岸可能会坍塌。在已经开垦的地里，特别是新开垦不久的地里，流沙淤积的情形也很多。因此，在我看来，在岸旁植树和在沟岸上栽种生长迅速的草来保护沟岸，似乎是一种急待要做的工作。这里也已经开了一些井，来利用地下水。
    在已经开垦过的土地上，到处都出现了绿意。这里的耕作和开辟土地，都是用机器的。推土机把一片地推平，在四周堆成约一公尺高的地埂，两道地埂中间就是水沟，可以随时放水灌溉。开垦较早的地方，牧草长得很不坏。大片的土地上种着柑桔、芒果、枣椰树，虽然都还幼小，生长的情形都还不错。这里据说也在试验栽培桑树。有的地上种着豌豆、蚕豆、草莓、小麦。有的地种过花生、大米和香茅草，现在已经收割。解放省的农业政策是以60％的土地种植水果和蔬菜，显然因为这是可以得到较高收益的农作物。其余20％的土地种植小麦和玉米，20％的土地种牧草。但是禁止种植棉花。据说是因为怕帝国主义看了这样大面积的棉田而眼红。
    愈是新开垦的土地，地力不足的现象就愈明显。在去年刚开出来的一片地上，已经播种了小麦，但是发芽率似乎不很高，生长的情况也不好。陪我们参观的人说，这些小麦是不可能得到收成的。解放省当局告诉我们说，每菲登土地开垦所需的费用是二百一十镑。目前从种植蔬菜的土地上可得每年每菲登一百二十镑的收入，种小麦的地上约可得七十镑。但是，这当然只是指开垦较早的土地。显然，在新地开垦以后的一两年中，必须作赔本的打算，只有在土壤改良达到一定程度以后，才有可能得到盈余。
    在一片新的土地上，一队推土机正在开辟新的耕地。新的公路和水沟正在往前延伸。一个新的村庄正在兴建。解放省的人以他们已经在沙漠上创造了生命，建设了新的生活而自豪。他们把自己的工作称之为对沙漠的入侵，这是有道理的。沙漠同人的改造沙漠的意志在作着严酷的斗争，人必须征服沙漠。他们所依赖的武器就是水，就是科学就是他们的坚决的意志和顽强的劳动。
    新垦区有一个发电量为三千瓩的发电站，供应全区所需的电力。现在正在兴建一座发电量为八千瓩的电站。这个电站将用中国机器。可是，我们的对外贸易机关却忘了给这个机器附上有阿拉伯文或英文的说明书，以致给埃及安装工人带来了很大的困难。他们见到了中国人都很高兴，把我们领到一座上海华通开关厂出品的操纵电流、电压的机器旁边，要求我们把上面的方块汉字翻成英文。而我们这些不懂电气技术的人，却爱莫能助，无法帮他们的忙。
    埃及人民对于完成这个改造沙漠的计划是有信心的。因为，在埃及历史上，有过不少成功地征服了沙漠的例子。三千年以前，古埃及法老王阿曼·马哈特第三第一个利用尼罗河水，在开罗以南尼罗河东面的沙漠上开辟了至今犹存的法尤姆省。这块土地成了埃及东部沙漠上异葩独放的一片沃地。十多年以前，有一位希腊人在亚历山大港的东面加夫尔陀瓦地方，在沙漠中开挖了一条运河，在那里栽培了大量果树，并且年复一年地向沙漠入侵。后来由于政治上的原因，这种入侵才停止了。现在这片土地以西的沙漠，也在计划中的解放省范围之内。我们从亚历山大港回开罗的时候，经过加夫尔陀瓦，看到了那一片生长良好的果树园。在这片果园以西的沙漠上，黄沙中间一望无际地生长着一种颜色像艾草样的植物，还有人在这里牧放羊群。这使我们相信，埃及人民将完成他们的征服沙漠的计划，并且取得远远超过他们的先驱者所曾经取得的巨大的成就。（附图片）
