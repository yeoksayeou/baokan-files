	A Whimsical Comfort
	The French Resident Minister in Algeria, Lacoste, recently shouted at the Provincial Council of Dordogne in France: "We don't need the United Nations to solve the Algerian problem!"

	However, the facts disappointed Lacoste. Despite his unwillingness, the United Nations General Assembly will discuss the Algerian issue, and that day is getting closer and closer. Therefore, he devised a way to comfort himself. He said: "The leaders of the 'rebels'... are calling on international public opinion to condemn us because their fighters are tired." Then, he closed his eyes and exercised his whimsical ability, saying that he saw Algerian insurgents launching a "surrender movement" and heard a "prelude to a ceasefire."

	General Ély, Chief of Staff of the French Armed Forces in Algeria, must have smiled wryly after learning of Lacoste's fantasy. Because the activities of the Algerian insurgents have been increasing recently, and the French colonial army has been constantly attacked, General Ély had to convene an emergency meeting of senior military personnel in December last year to discuss countermeasures. However, shortly after the meeting, even the Bourdeaux airport near Algiers was attacked by the insurgents, the entire guard of the French colonial authorities was annihilated, and hangars and some aircraft and military trucks were burned. These facts are such a great irony to Lacoste's fantasy about the Algerian insurgents being "tired" of the struggle.

	Lacoste's fantasy may be due to a reason. The British magazine "New Statesman and Nation" published an Algerian dispatch by reporter Carroll last year, which wrote about the following fact: The French colonial authorities in Oran gleefully arranged a gathering to warmly welcome a group of French troops who had just been sent to Algeria; however, these guests threw empty "Coca-Cola" bottles at the reception staff and shouted: "Dirty colonialists, get out!" These French youths, who were forced to wear military uniforms, were already tired of the criminal act of killing the Algerian people before they even started. Lacoste may have found inspiration in similar facts and fantasized that the Algerian insurgents were also tired.

	Unfortunately for Lacoste, fantasy cannot replace reality after all. Therefore, Lacoste may indeed feel somewhat comforted at the moment he is fantasizing; but after he regains his senses, he will inevitably fall into greater sorrow. (Recorded)

### 狂想的安慰

    狂想的安慰
    法国在阿尔及利亚的驻节部长拉戈斯特最近在法国多尔多?省省议会上大叫道：“我们不需要联合国来解决阿尔及利亚问题！”
    可是，事实却使拉戈斯特感到很失望。尽管他满心不愿意，联合国大会还是要讨论阿尔及利亚问题，而且这日子已经越来越近了。因此，他想了一个办法来自我安慰一下。他说：“‘叛乱分子’的领袖之所以……呼吁国际舆论来谴责我们，是因为他们的战士已经厌倦了。”接着，他就闭起眼睛来发挥自己的狂想能力，说他看到了阿尔及利亚起义者正在开展一个“投降运动”，并且听到了一支“停火的前奏曲”。
    法国在阿尔及利亚的武装部队总参谋长埃利将军知道了拉戈斯特这种狂想以后，一定会苦笑几声。由于最近以来阿尔及利亚起义者的活动越来越加强，法国殖民军队不断受到袭击，埃利将军在去年12月不得不手忙脚乱地召集高级军事人员来开了一次紧急会议，商量应付的办法。然而在会议开过后不久，连阿尔及尔市附近的布尔多机场也受到了起义者的袭击，法国殖民当局的警卫队全部被歼灭，飞机库以及一些飞机和军用卡车也被烧毁了。这些事实，对拉戈斯特关于阿尔及利亚起义者已经“厌倦”的斗争那种狂想，该是多大的讽刺。
    拉戈斯特的狂想也许是事出有因的。英国“新政治家与民族”杂志在去年发表的记者卡洛尔的一篇阿尔及利亚通讯里曾经写过这样一件事实：奥兰市的法国殖民当局兴高采烈地安排了一次集会来隆重欢迎一批刚被派到阿尔及利亚来的法国军队；可是，这些客人们却用“可口可乐”的空瓶来扔掷招待人员，并且高声叫喊：“殖民主义的脏东西，滚出去！”这些被迫穿上军服的法国青年，对于杀害阿尔及利亚人民的罪恶勾当，还没有开始做就已经感到厌倦。拉戈斯特可能在类似的事实里找到了灵感，就狂想起阿尔及利亚起义者也已经厌倦了。
    对于拉戈斯特说来，可惜的是，狂想毕竟不能代替现实。因此，拉戈斯特在他正在狂想的一刹那，可能的确感到有所安慰；但是到神智稍一清醒以后，却难免陷在更大的悲哀里了。（录）
