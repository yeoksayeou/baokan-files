    On the Eve of the Polish Elections
    By Our Correspondent Xie Wenqing
    The Polish parliamentary elections, held every four years, will take place on January 20th. These elections are being held under the following circumstances: the implementation of the Six-Year Plan has achieved great success in socialist industrialization, but due to the tense international situation at the time and some shortcomings in the plan, the people's current interests were not taken into account enough while focusing on solving the people's long-term interests. In addition, some errors were made in investment and economic management due to lack of experience, resulting in imbalances between heavy and light industries, and between industry and agriculture, causing some economic difficulties. The Polish United Workers' Party and the government have long told the people about these situations truthfully, and have taken many effective measures to correct these errors. The resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party and the common election program of all parties were formulated under the guidance of this spirit. Therefore, the party and the government have gained the understanding of the people, and the people of Poland support the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session and the common election program.
    Before the election, the voices of the people trusting the Polish United Workers' Party and demanding the strengthening of socialist democracy can be heard everywhere, but occasionally there are individual negative complaints and malicious clamors. The election campaign began on November 29 last year. On that day, a conference of activists from all over Poland was held in Warsaw, at which Gomulka and the leaders of various parties delivered speeches. Comrade Gomulka said, "A free, independent, and autonomous Poland can only be a socialist Poland." This sentence touched the hearts of the Polish people. All Poles who know their national history understand that for more than a hundred years before the establishment of the people's Poland, Poland's national independence was never guaranteed, and it had been divided by the great powers three times. It was only after the Soviet October Revolution that Poland was recognized as an independent country. However, the anti-Soviet and anti-communist policies pursued by the Polish rulers at that time once again led to the fall of Poland under fascist occupation. It was only after the establishment of the people's Poland twelve years ago that Poland obtained guarantees of national independence and sovereignty, and in a short period of time transformed Poland from a backward agricultural country into a country with a strong heavy industry and defense industry. "Mistakes are not enough to explain our party's policies, what is enough to explain is the fact that the country has recovered from the ruins of war and economic decline... One or two trees cannot obscure the forest. Whoever only sees the mistakes in our party's activities sees nothing at all." Comrade Gomulka's words hit the fatal wounds of those malicious clamorers. Because during the current election campaign, counter-revolutionaries are using this to carry out activities. When they talk about Poland's current standard of living, they deliberately avoid the iron facts of the devastating destruction Poland suffered in the war and the four or five million unemployed left after the war, and deliberately compare it with those capitalist countries that live by exploiting colonies.
    On December 29, when voters in the second constituency of Warsaw met with the eight candidates, people raised various questions and demands related to the country's political and economic life to their candidates. Voters demanded that the new parliament fully exercise the powers given to it by the constitution and strengthen parliamentary supervision of the government to overcome bureaucracy. In addition, they also demanded the implementation of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the United Workers' Party. In this meeting, in addition to the legitimate demands of the vast majority of people, some people also raised the hackneyed tune of negating the achievements of the people's Poland in construction over the past ten years, and indirectly attempted to blame the candidates of the Polish United Workers' Party. This kind of clamor was immediately drowned out by a chorus of boos from the voters. Worker Tovnivsky stood up and said: "The factories and houses built by our party and the people for twelve years are all here, Warsaw stands before us, only the blind can't see these achievements. Okay, you say everything we did in the past was wrong, then please tell me, in Polish history which party and social system has given every worker full employment. Tell me!" When the provocateur was rendered speechless, the masses answered this easily answered question for him in a loud voice. But the provocateur was not reconciled, he turned his attack to the issue of the rule of law, desperately repeating the phenomena of destroying the rule of law that the party and the government had already criticized and that belonged to the past, saying that the parliament's responsibility was to supervise the government's compliance with the rule of law. Candidates Jaworski and the voters immediately told him that the parliament should of course supervise the government, but it was also the duty of every citizen to abide by the law. At the same time, rogues and adventurers must not be allowed to have the freedom to destroy the rule of law.
    With the progress of socialist construction, the scope of democracy in this Polish election has been greatly expanded. Each voter can freely elect the person he supports from the unified list of candidates. Therefore, the people's political enthusiasm has also been greatly improved. When nominating candidates, more than 60,000 people were nominated across the country. However, the constitution stipulates that only one member can be elected for every 60,000 residents, so it is of course impossible to accommodate and unnecessary to nominate so many candidates. After consultation between the representatives of the parties participating in the National Unity Front, it was jointly proposed to nominate 723 candidates. The names of these candidates have been distributed to various constituencies across the country, and voters will elect 459 of them through secret ballot. This election of Polish parliamentarians is jointly nominated by various parties and jointly campaigned. This was determined after full democratic consultation between the representatives of the parties. Because Poland is a socialist country under the dictatorship of the proletariat, only the working class party and other democratic parties that support socialism have the right to propose candidates for parliamentarians. The joint nomination of candidates by various parties participating in the National Unity Front is an important measure supported by the people of the whole country. Those reactionary forces who attempt to fish in troubled waters will naturally not relax their attacks on this point, and they talk a lot about "100%" democracy. At the voters' meeting in the first constituency of Warsaw, the reporter also heard people's merciless refutation of the "100%" democracy theorists. Voter Gochik replied: "You can't find 100% democracy anywhere in the world. In capitalist countries, only exploiters enjoy democracy. In our socialist country, exploiters and their agents have no democracy."
    Currently, a tense election campaign is being launched throughout Poland. Meetings between candidates and voters are one of the most important and common ways of election activity. Various propaganda posters and pamphlets of the common election program of various parties have been popularized to every corner of urban and rural areas. A staff member of the Central Election Commission said that the work of checking the voter list has now been completed, and many voters have personally gone to the election committee in their place of residence to check whether their names have been missed. He pointed out that now it is necessary to unite all socialist and patriotic forces and repel the provocateurs who appear in the election campaign with various slogans covering their true faces. A Polish friend, Moravsky, told the reporter that the reactionaries can only secretly put forward some slogans to confuse ordinary voters, but they cannot put forward any of their own political programs. The common election program of all parties is the only program supported by the people of the whole country. An old construction worker said: "The reactionaries not only dare not put forward their program, but also dare not say half a 'no' to the common election program, because they know that this program represents the will of the entire Polish people."
    The Polish people see very clearly that although the country currently has some economic difficulties, a relatively complete industrial system has been built after all. In the future, as long as it can be fully utilized, the people's Poland will be able to overcome difficulties and begin to progress smoothly within a year or two. When the party and the government told the people about these real situations truthfully, they received the complete understanding of the people. Not long ago, workers from more than a dozen factories collectively requested the government to issue national bonds in order to help the country overcome temporary economic difficulties. (Poland has only issued national bonds once in the past). Many workers have voluntarily donated their purchased national bonds, but the government believes that it is not necessary to do so at present, and the Minister of Finance has made an explanation to the people.) Recently, workers from more than a dozen large factories collectively announced that they would give up the bonuses and overtime pay that they had been owed in the past. Here, the working class once again demonstrated their enthusiasm for building socialism and their spirit of self-sacrifice to the motherland. Throughout Poland, in conversations, at meetings, and in newspapers and magazines, a common sentence is spoken and written everywhere: "Only a socialist Poland can be an independent, free, and happy Poland."

### 波兰大选的前夕

    波兰大选的前夕
    本报记者　谢文清
    四年一次的波兰议会选举将在1月20日举行。这次选举是在这样的情况下举行的：执行六年计划的结果在社会主义工业化方面已取得了巨大成就，但因当时国际形势紧张和计划中的一些缺点，在着重解决人民的长远利益的时候未能更多地照顾到人民的当前利益，加之因缺乏经验而在投资和经济管理中犯了一些错误，就产生了重工业与轻工业之间和工业与农业之间的不平衡，造成了一些经济困难。波兰统一工人党和政府早已把这些情况原原本本地告诉了人民，并已采取了许多有效的措施来改正这些错误。统一工人党八中全会的决议和各党派共同选举纲领，就是在这种精神指导下制定的。因此，党和政府已获得了人民的谅解，波兰全国人民都拥护八中全会的决议和共同选举纲领。
    在大选之前，到处可以听到人民信任波兰统一工人党和要求加强社会主义民主的呼声，但偶尔也有个别的消极埋怨和恶意叫嚣。选举运动是在去年11月29日开始的。那天在华沙举行了全波积极分子大会，会上哥穆尔卡和各党派的领袖都发表了演说，哥穆尔卡同志说：“自由、独立和自主的波兰只能是社会主义的波兰”。这句话触动了波兰人民的心弦。凡是知道自己民族历史的波兰人都明白：在人民政权波兰成立前的一百多年中，波兰的民族独立从来都是没有保障的，而且曾经三次遭到列强的瓜分。只是在苏联十月革命后，波兰才被承认是个独立国家。可是当时波兰统治者奉行的反苏反共政策，又曾把波兰国家沦亡于法西斯的占领下。只是在十二年前波兰的人民政权建立后，波兰才获得了民族独立和主权的保证，并且在短期内把波兰从一个落后的农业国变成了拥有强大重工业和国防工业的国家。“错误不足以说明我们党的政策，足以说明的是国家从战争的废墟和经济衰落中复兴起来这一事实……一两棵树遮蔽不了森林。谁只看到我们党活动中的错误，那就是什么也没有看到。”哥穆尔卡同志这些话正击中了那些恶意叫嚣者们的致命伤。因为在目前的选举运动中反革命分子正在利用这一点进行活动。他们在谈到波兰目前的生活水平时，有意避开波兰在战争中遭受的毁灭性的破坏和战后留下四、五百万失业者这些铁的事实，并且故意同那些靠剥削殖民地过活的资本主义国家对比。
    12月29日，华沙第二选区的选民同八个候选人会见时，人们向自己的候选人提出了有关国家政治经济生活的各种问题和要求。选民们要求将来新议会能充分履行宪法所给它的权力，加强议会对政府的监督，以克服官僚主义。此外，他们还要求实现统一工人党八中全会的决议。在这次会见中，除了绝大部分人的正当要求外，也有人提出否定人民波兰十多年来建设成就的滥调，并转弯抹角地企图责难波兰统一工人党的候选人。这种叫嚣当时就被选民们的一片“嘘”声所淹没了。工人托夫尼夫斯基站起来说：“我们党和人民十二年建设的工厂房屋都明摆在这里，华沙就站在我们面前，只有瞎了眼睛的人才看不见这些成就。好吧，你说我们过去一切都错了，那么请问你，在波兰历史上那个政党和社会制度曾给每个劳动者以充分的职业。你说说呀！”当那个挑衅者被问得哑口无言时，群众就用响亮的声音替他回答了这个很容易回答的问题。可是那个挑衅者还不甘心，他把攻击点转到法制问题上来了，拼命重复党和政府早已批判过了的、已经属于过去的破坏法制的现象，说什么议会的责任就是要监督政府遵守法制。候选人雅沃尔斯基和选民们立刻就告诉他议会当然要监督政府，但遵守法制也是每个公民的义务。同时决不容许流氓和冒险分子有破坏法制的自由。
    随着社会主义建设的进展，波兰这次大选的民主范围已相当扩大，每个选民可以从统一的候选人名单中自由选举他所拥护的人。因此人民的政治积极性也大大提高了。在提候选人时，全国各地竟提出了六万多名。但宪法规定每六万居民中才能选出一个议员，当然容纳不了，也不必要提这么多候选人。经参加民族统一阵线的各党派代表协商后，结果共同提出七百二十三个候选人，这些候选人的名字已被分布在全国各个选区，选民将以秘密投票方式从中选出四百五十九个。这次波兰议员的选举，是由各党派联合提名候选人并联合竞选的。这是各党派代表经过充分的民主协商后确定的。因为波兰是无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，只有工人阶级政党和拥护社会主义的其它民主党派才有权提出议员候选人。由参加民族统一阵线的各党派联合提出候选人名单，这是受到全国人民拥护的重要措施。那些企图混水摸鱼的反动势力自然不会放松对这一点的攻击，他们大谈什么“百分之百”的民主。在华沙第一选区的选民集会上，记者也听到了人们对“百分之百”的民主论者的无情的驳斥。选民高契克回答说：“走遍天下也找不到百分之百的民主。在资本主义国家只有剥削者享有民主。在我们社会主义国家，剥削者及其代理人就没有民主。”
    目前全波各地正在展开紧张的选举活动，候选人同选民的会见，是选举活动中最重要而普遍的方式之一。各种宣传画、各党派共同选举纲领的小册子等已普及到城乡的各个角落。中央选举委员会的一位工作人员说，目前选民名单的核对工作已经完毕，有许多选民还亲自到自己住地的选举委员会去查对是否会漏掉自己的名字。他指出现在应团结一切社会主义的和爱国的力量，击退在选举运动中出现的用各种口号掩盖着真实面貌的挑拨分子。一位波兰朋友莫拉夫斯基对记者说，反动派只能鬼鬼祟祟地提些迷惑普通选民的口号，但提不出任何自己的政纲。各党派的共同选举纲领是受到全国人民拥护的、唯一的纲领。一位老建筑工人说：“反动分子不但不敢提出他们的纲领，而且对共同选举纲领也不敢吐半个‘不’字，因为他们知道这个纲领代表着全体波兰人民的意志。”
    波兰人民看得很清楚，尽管国家目前有着若干经济困难，但毕竟已建成了较全面的工业体系，今后只要能充分利用，人民波兰在一两年内就能克服困难而开始顺利的进展。当党和政府把这些真实情况原本地告诉人民时，就得到了人民的完全谅解。不久以前，有十几个工厂的工人为帮助国家克服暂时的经济困难，曾集体请求政府发行国家公债。（波兰在过去只发行过一次公债）。有许多工人已自动捐献了自己购买的公债券，但政府认为目前还没有必要这样作，而由财政部长向人民作了说明。）最近又有十几个大工厂的工人集体宣布放弃过去欠发给他们的奖金和加班费等。在这里，工人阶级又一次表现了他们建设社会主义的热情和对祖国的自我牺牲精神。在全波兰，在言谈中，在集会上和在报刊上到处都说着、写着一句共同的话：“只有社会主义的波兰，才能是独立、自由和幸福的波兰。”
