Premier Daoud Khan's Speech

Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen:

I am deeply honored to be able to welcome our distinguished guests and friends, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their esteemed colleagues, on behalf of the Afghan government and people.

I am also personally very pleased to be able to gather with you all tonight. I hope that due to your visit, the friendly relations between Afghanistan and China will have a bright future.

It is a well-known fact that Afghanistan and China have maintained close trade and cultural ties for hundreds of years, and we are not strangers to each other. Fortunately, during these hundreds of years of contact between our two peoples, our relationship has never been damaged by differences and animosity. In the long past, whenever we met and visited each other, we both benefited and promoted mutual understanding and prosperity.

The scourge of the 13th century caused Afghanistan and China to suffer the same devastation. After that, contact was interrupted, and later, when sea transportation developed and the conditions of world trade underwent fundamental changes, we parted ways. For a long time thereafter, we knew almost nothing about each other's situation.

Today, we meet again in a resurgent and awakened Asia, and fortunately, we meet again in a spirit of friendship and good neighborliness.

With the mutual dispatch of permanent diplomatic representatives, the long-lost connection between us has been restored. I am very pleased to say that these relations have been in an atmosphere of sincerity and friendship from the very beginning.

Gentlemen, distinguished guests, neutrality is Afghanistan's traditional national policy. We believe that this policy, which is in line with the principles of the United Nations Charter, is an ideal moral foundation for promoting peace and understanding among all countries in the world, and a factor in the security and prosperity of our own people.

In fact, those who criticize neutrality are trying to find excuses for their own blocs. The current bloc system has clearly been a cause of discord, and these blocs are creating divisions, especially among the peoples of Asia and Africa. We give due care and respect to the principles of the Bandung Conference, and we also believe that adhering to these principles can not only guarantee the happiness and prosperity of member states but is also an important factor in world security and the prosperity of all mankind.

Finally, on behalf of the Afghan people, I sincerely wish the great Chinese people happiness and prosperity. I would like to reiterate that the Afghan government and people are willing to establish the most sincere friendly relations with the Chinese government and people on the basis of mutual respect and in the spirit of peace and constructive cooperation.

May our friendship last forever, and may our friendship contribute to international understanding and friendship.

I propose a toast:

To our distinguished guests,

To the friendship between Afghanistan and China,

To the progress and prosperity of the Chinese people,

To the health of His Excellency Mao Zedong.

### 达乌德汗首相的讲话

专栏：

    达乌德汗首相的讲话阁下、先生们：
    我能够代表阿富汗政府和人民欢迎我们的贵宾和朋友周恩来总理，贺龙副总理，以及他们的可敬的同行人员，感到非常荣幸。
    今晚我们能够同各位聚会，我个人也感到非常愉快。我希望，由于你们的访问，阿富汗同中国的友好关系会有美好的前途。
    大家都知道的事实是：阿富汗同中国保持了几百年的密切的贸易和文化联系，我们彼此并不陌生。幸运的是，在我们两国人民之间这几百年的接触当中，我们的关系从来没有被分歧和恶感所损害。在悠久的过去，每当我们会晤和互相访问的时候，我们彼此都得到好处，而且促进了彼此的了解和繁荣。
    十三世纪的祸害使阿富汗和中国蒙受了同样的蹂躏，在那以后，接触中断了，后来当海上交通发展起来和世界贸易状况发生根本改变的时候，我们分手了，在那以后的长时间内我们几乎彼此完全不了解对方的情况。
    今天，我们在重新兴起的、觉醒了的亚洲再度会晤了，而且非常幸运，我们又本着友好和睦邻的精神会晤了。
    随着互相派遣了常驻外交代表，我们之间长期失去的联系又恢复了。我非常高兴地说，这些关系从开始的时候起就是在真诚和友好的气氛中。
    先生们，贵宾们，中立是阿富汗的传统的国家政策。我们认为这种符合联合国宪章的原则的政策是促进和平和世界各国之间的了解的理想的道义基础，而且是我们自己的人民的安全和繁荣的因素。
    事实上，那些抨击中立的人们是想为他们自己的集团找借口。目前的集团体系显然一直是不和的原因，而且这些集团特别在亚非国家人民中间制造分歧。我们对万隆会议的原则给予应有的关怀和尊重，我们还认为，遵守这些原则不仅能够保证成员国的幸福和繁荣，而且是世界安全和全人类繁荣的重要因素。
    最后，我代表阿富汗人民诚挚地祝伟大的中国人民幸福和繁荣。我要重申一下，阿富汗政府和人民愿意在互相尊重的基础上并且本着和平和建设性合作的精神，同中国政府和人民建立最真诚的友好关系。
    愿我们的友谊长存，愿我们的友谊有助于国际谅解和友谊。
    我建议：
    为我们的贵宾们，
    为阿中两国的友谊，
    为中国人民的进步和繁荣，
    为毛泽东阁下的健康干杯。
