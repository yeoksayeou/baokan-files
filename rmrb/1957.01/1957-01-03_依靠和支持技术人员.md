Rely on and Support Technical Personnel
Jin Zaijun, Zhu Jianchu

After the joint state-private ownership transformation of the Jiaxing Minfeng Paper Mill, the mill implemented the light industry policy of continuously improving quality, increasing variety, reducing costs, meeting the needs of the people's livelihood, and supporting key construction projects. Over the past few years, it has created and imitated 17 kinds of special papers, such as blueprint paper, capacitor paper, tracing paper, and telephone cable insulation paper. At the same time, it has also explored some experiences in using grass to replace hemp and wood pulp to make paper. Currently, three types of grass—thatch, reed, and rice straw—have been applied to production, solving the difficulty of insufficient supply of paper-making raw materials and greatly reducing production costs. Calculating based on replacing hemp pulp with low-grade raw materials, 325,000 yuan has been saved.

In the process of trial-manufacturing new products and raw material substitutes, the Minfeng Paper Mill prominently focused on mobilizing the work of technical personnel, which played a significant role in the trial-manufacturing of new products and raw material substitutes.

Overcoming Sectarian Sentiments

Trial-manufacturing new products and raw material substitutes is a very meticulous and complex technical research task. Therefore, fully leveraging the enthusiasm of technical personnel and strengthening the unity between technical personnel and veteran workers are key to ensuring the completion of the task. To mobilize technical personnel, it is first necessary to overcome the sectarian sentiments towards technical personnel within the Party.

The sectarian sentiments towards technical personnel did exist among the cadres of the Minfeng Paper Mill. Shortly after the joint state-private ownership transformation, the Minfeng Paper Mill planned to promote a group of technical personnel to assume technical leadership positions. At that time, some cadres did not understand, saying: "They came out of school and don't understand anything. They learned a little something in front of the workers, and now they are promoted to manage the workers, which will affect the enthusiasm of the workers." "Technical personnel rely on three parts skill and seven parts connections to eat. Their technical knowledge is a set of empty theories and has no use." Some cadres had excessively high demands on technical personnel, requiring them to solve production problems immediately when they encountered them. If they could not solve them temporarily, they were criticized, which dampened their enthusiasm for going to the workshop. Some cadres believed that technical personnel were ideologically backward, had complex social relations, and were difficult to lead, and they discriminated against them politically. A workshop director praised an engineer who helped solve a key production problem, but the branch secretary believed that he had been close to capitalists in the past, and this praise was a loss of position and criticized the workshop director within the Party. Even when some technical personnel made progress in their thinking and contributions to production, and were评上了 [awarded] model workers, they were said to have been "hard-promoted by the leadership." In short, some cadres often only saw the negative side of technical personnel and did not see their progress and positive side. In this situation, some technical personnel were also very depressed, feeling that they were "second-class members of the working class."

The Party Committee of the Minfeng Paper Mill analyzed these situations, pointing out that ignoring the important role of technical personnel in production and ignoring their enthusiasm for building socialism were manifestations of a weak view of relying on the working class. They also used typical examples of engineers going deep into reality and helping workers solve production problems to educate cadres, affirming that the desire for progress was the positive mainstream of the technical personnel. Their negative and backward side required the party to actively unite them and help them carry out self-transformation. The Party Committee called on party members and cadres, especially members of the Party Committee, to take the lead in overcoming sectarian emotions and play a demonstration role in the work of uniting technical personnel.

After a series of political and ideological work, the sectarian emotions and one-sided views among the cadres were gradually overcome, the work of technical personnel was valued, their positions were properly arranged, and some necessary care was given to them politically and in their lives. This greatly stimulated the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the technical personnel, laying the foundation for the trial-manufacturing of new products and raw material substitutes.

Emphasizing Ideological Work

When the state's trial-manufacturing task was assigned, mobilizing technical personnel to actively complete this task was not just a technical work; it also required the Party organization to do ideological work and support it in various aspects. Most of the new products trial-manufactured by the Minfeng Paper Mill lacked technical data, and not all the technical conditions were available; moreover, the technical performance and specifications of the paper were very strict, and there were many difficulties in the trial-manufacturing process. In this situation, many technical personnel had a fear of difficulty and did not dare to boldly take responsibility for trial-manufacturing, believing that this was a thankless "extra burden." Workshop directors also had a sense of resistance, believing that "the workshop is a production factory, not a laboratory," and "if the production plan is not completed, we will be criticized, and if the trial-manufacturing is sloppy, we will just make a self-criticism."

The Party Committee criticized this fear of difficulty, pointing out that although there were many difficulties in trial-manufacturing new products and raw material substitutes, there were also favorable conditions: the factory had sufficient technical strength and had accumulated some production experience, and as long as we worked hard and studied, we could overcome the difficulties. At the same time, the Party Committee also vigorously mobilized technical personnel to study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and implement the six suggestions of Soviet experts on the paper industry, seeking ways to overcome difficulties from here. For example, in the trial-manufacturing of capacitor paper, the paper was as thin as bamboo membrane and required sulphate wood pulp, which had never been manufactured in China, and no information could be found in English or American books. Some technical personnel lacked confidence and had many concerns, while some model workers insisted on trial-manufacturing according to the proportion and analysis of Soviet paper samples. The Party Committee supported the positive opinions, and after dozens of large and small experiments, overcame the difficulties in raw materials and equipment, and finally succeeded in the trial-manufacturing. This gave the technical personnel a great education. Some said: "It's true that you have to learn as long as you live! You must honestly learn from the top Soviet technology."

In the trial-manufacturing of raw material substitutes, ideological work is also very important. For example, in the initial trial, the workshop generally believed that "you get what you pay for, and inferior raw materials make inferior goods." Without constant ideological work and without solving these problems, work could not be carried out smoothly.

At the same time, the Party Committee also supported the trial-manufacturing in various aspects. Before the trial-manufacturing, reasonable arrangements were made for the time and raw materials required for the new products. Every suggestion of the technical personnel was carefully studied and supported. If it did not work, explanations were made and properly handled. If it failed temporarily, they were encouraged to continue experimenting. This ensured the发挥 [play] enthusiasm of technical personnel. For example, in the trial-manufacturing of capacitor paper, copper filings fell into the pulp due to the metal blades during beating, which affected the conductive effect of the paper. Engineer Chen Zhiwei and others suggested adding stone pulp blades. The Party Committee instructed the administrative department to conduct experimental research, and the conclusion was that adding stone pulp blades could ensure the quality of the paper, but this measure required a long construction time. Therefore, the factory requested instructions from the Paper Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry while explaining the situation to comrades such as Chen Zhiwei. After the Industrial Management Bureau of the Paper Industry approved this measure, it was immediately implemented, ensuring the quality of the capacitor paper.

The trial-manufacturing tasks of new products and raw material substitutes were often挤掉 [squeezed out] by the production tasks of old products, which made the technical personnel participating in the trial-manufacturing work feel difficult. The factory leaders paid special attention to the arrangement of these two aspects of work, so that both aspects were the responsibility of special personnel, ensuring both the completion of the trial-manufacturing task of new products and the completion of normal production tasks. Facts have proved that the rich experience in the production of old products is the foundation for the trial-manufacturing of new products; the new experiences and new technologies obtained from the trial-manufacturing of new products have helped to improve the quality of old products.

Organizing a Technical Leadership Core

In the process of trial-manufacturing new products and raw material substitutes, if the technical personnel succeeded in trial-manufacturing in the laboratory, they needed to cooperate closely with all relevant departments of the factory to put it into large-scale trial-manufacturing. Therefore, organizing a technical leadership core to combine science and labor is a major issue in completing the task.

From the second half of 1954, the Minfeng Paper Mill organized a new product trial-manufacturing team. The team consisted of more than 20 people, including the main engineering and technical personnel and the 30-40 years experienced beating and papermaking master workers, and was specifically led by the deputy director of production. For each new product trial-manufacturing, the central laboratory first carefully studied the Soviet standards, identified the special performance and theoretical basis of the product, and after collective research and revision by the new product trial-manufacturing team, a small-scale pulping and papermaking experiment was carried out. On this basis, a large-scale trial-manufacturing plan was drawn up and submitted to the relevant workshop cadres and workers for discussion and supplementation, and then officially put into large-scale trial-manufacturing. This strengthened the cooperation between departments, strengthened the unity between workers and technical personnel, and also corrected the phenomenon of争功忌功 [competing for credit and fearing blame] when preliminary achievements were made in trial-manufacturing.

Implementing the "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy in the trial-manufacturing process is also very important. Whenever there was a major technical issue, the trial-manufacturing team organized the main forces of the entire factory to study and discuss it. For example, when trial-manufacturing tracing paper last year, key problems such as the difficulty of dewatering the suction box and high-viscosity pulp could not be solved. After learning from the Polish experience, although the situation improved, the moisture content of the felt rollers was still 94%. At that time, the workshop director suggested adding another vacuum pump to divide the suction box into two groups. This opinion aroused heated debate. Some doubted its effectiveness, and some worried that the suction of the vacuum pump was too large and would have side effects. After learning from the experience of the Jilin Paper Mill in using two pumps, the veteran workers and technicians of the workshop added the opinion of adding more plum blossom pumps, which finally reduced the moisture content and improved the uniformity and transparency of the paper. These technical disputes made everyone deeply feel that implementing the "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy on scientific and technical issues can achieve the purpose of "learning from each other, helping each other, learning from each other's strengths and making up for each other's weaknesses, and improving together."

In order to further consolidate the trial-manufacturing results, it is very beneficial to mobilize technical personnel to summarize technical operation experience after each new product trial-manufacturing. In 1955, the experience of "carrying out new product trial-manufacturing in three stages and nine steps, following a scientific order to carry out work" was summarized. After the successful trial-manufacturing of tracing paper in 1956, veteran workers and technical personnel were mobilized to discuss the experiences and lessons learned from the successful trial-manufacturing, and the technology department summarized twelve experiences in four aspects: raw material selection, raw material formulation, and operation. This not only benefits the future trial-manufacturing of new products, but also improves the technical and theoretical level of technical personnel and workers, enriches their production experience, and further promotes the combination of labor experience and science and technology.

    依靠和支持技术人员
    金在钧　朱建初
    嘉兴民丰造纸厂公私合营后，贯彻执行轻工业不断提高质量，增加品种，降低成本，满足人民生活需要，支援重点建设的方针，几年来，创造和仿造了晒图纸、电容器纸、描图纸、电话电缆绝缘纸等十七种特种用纸，同时还摸索到一些利用草类代替大麻和木浆制作纸张的经验；现在应用到生产上去的已有茅草、芮草、稻草三种，解决了造纸原料供应不足的困难，大大降低了生产成本。以低级原料代替麻浆计算，就节约了三十二万五千元。
    在试制新产品和原料代用品的过程中，民丰造纸厂突出地抓住了发动技术人员的工作，对试制新产品和原料代用品起了很大的作用。
    克服宗派情绪
    试制新产品和原料代用品，是一项十分细致复杂的技术研究工作。因此，充分发挥技术人员的积极性，加强技术人员同老工人的团结，是保证完成任务的关键。而要把技术人员发动起来，首先必须克服党内对技术人员的宗派情绪。
    对待技术人员的宗派情绪，在民丰造纸厂的干部中是曾经存在过的。公私合营不久，民丰造纸厂准备提拔一批技术人员担任技术领导工作。当时有些干部思想不通，说：“他们从学校里出来什么都不懂，在工人面前学到了一点东西，就提拔他们去管工人，会影响工人的积极性。”“技术人员是依靠三分本事、七分人事吃饭，技术上一套空洞理论，没啥作用。”有些干部对技术人员的要求又过高，遇到生产问题要求他们立刻解决，一时解决不了就加以批评，打击了他们下车间的积极性。有的干部认为技术人员思想落后，社会关系复杂，难领导，在政治上歧视他们。有个车间主任表扬了一位协助解决生产关键的工程师，支部书记认为他过去接近资本家，这种表扬失掉立场，在党内批评了车间主任。有的技术人员思想上有了进步，生产上有了贡献，评上了劳动模范，也被人说成是“领导上硬捧出来的”。总之，有一部分干部常常只看到技术人员的消极一面，没有看到他们的进步和积极的一面。在这种情况下，有些技术人员也很苦闷，感到自己是“副牌工人阶级”。
    中共民丰造纸厂党委会分析了这些情况，指出忽视技术人员在生产中的重要作用，忽视他们建设社会主义的积极性，就是依靠工人阶级的观点不强的表现。并且用工程师深入实际，帮助工人解决生产问题的典型事例教育干部，肯定要求进步是技术人员积极的主流的一面；而他们消极落后的一面，正需要我们去主动团结他们，帮助他们进行自我改造。党委号召党员干部，特别是党委委员带头克服宗派主义情绪，在团结技术人员的工作中起示范作用。
    经过一系列政治思想工作，逐步克服了干部中的宗派情绪和片面观点，重视了技术人员的工作，妥善安排了他们的职位，提升了十名工程师。在政治上和生活上也给予了一些必要的照顾。这就大大激发了技术人员的政治热情和生产积极性，为新产品和原料代用品的试验打下了基础。
    重视思想工作
    当国家试制任务下达后，发动技术人员积极完成这个任务，并不只是一桩技术工作，同样需要党组织作思想工作和从各方面来支持。民丰造纸厂试制的新产品，大都缺乏技术资料，技术条件也不是都具备了的；而且纸张技术性能、规格要求很严，试制中的困难很多。在这种情况下，不少技术人员存在着畏难情绪，不敢大胆负责地试制，认为这是吃力不讨好的“额外负担”。车间主任也有抵触情绪，认为“车间是生产工场，不是试验所”，“生产计划完不成要挨批评，试制马虎点最多检讨一下就行了”。
    党委批评了这种畏难情绪，指出试制新产品和原料代用品虽然困难很多，但也有有利条件：厂里的技术力量是充足的，也积累了一些生产经验，只要努力钻研，是能够克服困难的。同时，党委还大力动员技术人员学习苏联先进经验，贯彻苏联专家对造纸工业的六项建议，从这里来找寻克服困难的途径。例如试制电容器纸，纸张薄得像竹膜一样，需要用硫酸盐木浆，这种木浆中国从来没有制造过，英美书上也找不到一点资料。部分技术人员没有信心，顾虑很大；而有些劳动模范则坚持按苏联纸样配比、分析的结果来试制。党委支持积极意见，经过几十次大小试验，克服了原料上、设备上的困难，终于试制成功。这给技术人员很大的教育，有的说：“真是做到老、学到老啊！非得老老实实向苏联头等技术学习不可。”
    在原料代用品试制中，思想工作也是十分重要的。如在初试时，车间里普遍认为“一分价钱一分货，次等原料造次货”。没有经常的思想工作，不解决这些问题，是不能顺利开展工作的。
    同时，党委还从各方面支持试制。试制前对新产品所需时间、原料给以合理安排，对技术人员的每个建议都认真研究、支持，行不通的也要作解释，妥善加以处理；暂时失败了的，鼓励继续试验。这就保证了技术人员积极性的发挥。例如在试制电容器纸时，由于金属刀片在打浆时有铜屑落在纸浆内，影响纸起导电作用。工程师陈志蔚等建议添装石头浆刀，党委责成行政试验研究，结论是添装石头浆刀能保证纸张质量，但这个措施需要较长的施工时间。于是工厂一面向轻工业部造纸工业管理局请示，一面把情况向陈志蔚等同志说明。到造纸局工业管理批准了这个措施后，就立即着手实行，保证了电容器纸的质量。
    新产品和原料代用品的试制任务常常被老产品的生产任务挤掉，使参加试制工作的技术人员感到为难。厂领导就特别注意这两方面工作的安排，使两方面都有专人负责，既保证了新产品试制任务的完成，也保证了正常生产任务的完成。事实证明：老产品生产的丰富经验是试制新产品的基础；新产品的试制所得到的新经验、新技术，又帮助了老产品质量的提高。
    组织技术领导核心
    在试制新产品和原料代用品过程中，技术人员在实验室里试制成功了，要投入大规模试制，还需要和全厂有关部门密切配合。因此，组织技术领导核心，使科学与劳动相结合，是完成任务的一个重大问题。
    从1954年下半年起，民丰造纸厂组织了试制新产品小组。小组成员由主要工程技术人员和有三、四十年操作经验的打浆、造纸老师傅等二十多人组成，由生产副厂长具体领导。每试制一种新产品，先由中心试验室仔细研究苏联标准，找出产品特殊性能和理论根据，经试制新产品小组集体研究修正后，进行小型打浆抄纸实验。在这个基础上，再拟定大型试制计划，交给有关车间干部和工人讨论补充后，正式投入大型试制。这样做加强了各部门互相间的配合，加强了工人与技术人员间的团结，也纠正了试制获得初步成就时的争功忌功现象。
    在试制过程中贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针，也是很要紧的。每逢重大技术问题，试制小组就把全厂主要力量组织起来研究、讨论。如去年试制描图纸时，存在着吸水箱和高粘度浆料脱水困难等关键问题不能解决，学习波兰经验后，情况虽有改善，但毡辘上出的水分仍有94％。当时车间主任建议再添装一只真空泵，把吸水箱分成两组。这个意见引起大家热烈争论，有的怀疑效果不好，有的担心真空泵吸力过大，会产生副作用。经过学习吉林造纸厂使用两只泵的经验，车间老工人和技师又补充了多加梅花泵的意见，终于降低了水分，改进了纸张的匀度和透明度。这些技术上的争论，使大家深深感到：在科学技术问题上贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针，可以达到“互相学习，互相帮助，取长补短，共同提高”的目的。
    为了进一步巩固试制成果，在每种新产品试制后，发动技术人员总结技术操作经验，是很有好处的。1955年里总结了“试制新产品按三个阶段，九个步骤，遵循科学的秩序进行工作”的经验。1956年描图纸试制成功后，又发动老工人、技术人员座谈试制成功的经验教训，由工艺技术部门总结了原料选择、原料配方和操作等四个方面的十二条经验。这样作，不仅对今后试制新产品工作有利，而且也提高了技术人员和工人的技术理论水平，丰富了他们的生产经验，进一步促进了劳动经验和科学技术的结合。
