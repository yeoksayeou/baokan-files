Facing the Test

    Some cadres in Jiangsu Province are unwilling to be transferred to work in rural areas. In Pei County, a meeting of forty-one section and bureau chiefs was convened. After much mobilization, only two people volunteered. A cadre from the Suzhou Prefectural Water Conservancy Bureau said there were five fears about going to the countryside: first, fear of wind; second, fear of rain; third, fear of walking in the dark; fourth, fear of crossing bridges; fifth, fear of dog bites. In a word, fear of living a hard life. In Rugao County, some district cadres cried when they heard they were being transferred to the countryside.

    These comrades usually say that since they have joined the revolution, they will spare no sacrifice and are willing to go to the most difficult posts. However, when the country needs them to go to work posts that are more difficult than their current ones, they retreat. Going to the countryside and to difficult work posts is indeed a test for cadres. Facts have proven that some cadres cannot withstand this test.

    在考验面前
    江苏省部分干部不愿调到农村去工作。沛县召集四十一个科、局长开会，动员了半天，只有两个人报名。苏州专署水利局干部说下乡有五怕：一怕刮风；二怕下雨；三怕摸黑路；四怕过桥；五怕狗咬。一句话，怕过艰苦的生活。如皋县有的区干部听说要调到乡下去，哭了起来。
    这些同志平时都会说自己既然参加革命，是不惜任何牺牲的，是愿意到最艰苦的岗位上去的，可是当国家需要他到比现在艰苦一些的工作岗位上去的时候，他退缩了。到农村去，到艰苦的工作岗位上去，这的确是对干部的考验，事实证明，有些干部是经不起这种考验的。
