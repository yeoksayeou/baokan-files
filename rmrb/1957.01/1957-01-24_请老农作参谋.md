In the past, some places encountered subjectivist problems when promoting new farming techniques and increased production measures. One of the reasons for this was the failure to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, including neglecting the opinions of experienced farmers. Recently, some agricultural departments and agricultural production cooperatives in Shaanxi Province have paid special attention to consulting with experienced farmers for ideas on improving wheat field management. For example, the Zhangcun Agricultural Technology Extension Station in Shang County, seeing that some local wheat was not growing well, held discussions with experienced farmers to study remedial measures. The experienced farmers said that the land preparation work before sowing was rough, and after winter the weather was dry, so the wheat roots were not firmly established. Rolling the wheat could make the wheat roots tightly integrated with the soil. Later, some cooperatives tried it, and the effect was indeed good. Not long ago, the Chenguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hua County invited skilled experienced farmers to hold a "Zhuge Liang Meeting" (brainstorming session) to study the problem of protecting winter wheat seedlings. An experienced farmer expressed his opinion on the issue of "harrowing wheat." He said: Everyone knows the saying that "harrowing wheat in winter is better than applying fertilizer," but if the harrowing method is not correct, it may damage the wheat seedlings or pull out the wheat roots. At the same time, only dense wheat is suitable for harrowing, while sparse wheat is not suitable for harrowing but is suitable for rolling.

Consulting with experienced farmers as "advisers" in production, humbly listening to their opinions, and seriously studying them, can not only improve production and avoid some possible losses, but also strengthen unity within the agricultural cooperative, making experienced farmers as willing as young and middle-aged farmers to contribute their experience and wisdom to the collective cause of the cooperative.

    请老农作参谋
    有些地方过去在推行新的耕作技术和增产措施中出了一些主观主义的毛病，其原因之一，就是没有多虚心听取群众的意见，就中也忽视了老农的意见。最近，陕西省的一些农业部门和农业生产合作社在改善麦田管理上，特别注意请老农出主意。例如，商县张村农业技术推广站看到当地有的小麦长得不好，就去同老农座谈，研究补救办法。老农说，播种前整地工作粗糙，入冬后天旱，麦根扎的不稳，碾麦可以使麦根同土壤紧密结合。后来有的合作社试作了，效果的确良好。华县晨光农业生产合作社不久前邀请有本事的老农开了一个“诸葛亮会”，研究冬麦保苗问题。一位老农对于“耱麦”问题发表了自己的意见。他说：大家都知道冬季“耱麦胜似上粪”的说法，但是，耱的方法不对头，就可能伤麦苗，或者把麦根带出来。同时，只有稠麦适宜于耱，稀麦不适于耱，而适于碾。
    在生产中请有经验的老农作“参谋”，虚心倾听他们的意见，并且认真地加以研究，这样做，不仅可以把生产搞得更好，避免一些可能发生的损失，而且可以增强农业社内部的团结，使老农同青壮年农民一样乐于把自己的经验和智慧贡献给合作社的集体事业。
