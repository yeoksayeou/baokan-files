    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 30th. The French Republic's Senate on the 28th proposed amendments to the Mollet government's plan to establish a so-called "Sahara Region Joint Organization." This plan stipulates that the "Sahara region," currently belonging to Algeria, French West Africa, and French Equatorial Africa, will be extracted to become a single economic unit and, to some extent, a single administrative unit, in order to facilitate France's strengthening of its resource exploitation and political control over the region. This plan has been strongly opposed by the people of Algeria, French West Africa, and French Equatorial Africa.
    During the Republic Senate's discussion of this plan, French Prime Minister Mollet particularly emphasized the region's economic importance to France, noting that it has abundant mineral deposits, including oil, uranium, copper, iron, manganese, coal, and more.
    Mollet said that within a few years, this region would produce millions of tons of oil for France. He also said, "The Sahara, together with atomic energy, is one of the foundations of our independence."
    Because the Republic Senate proposed amendments to the French government's "Sahara Region Joint Organization" plan, the plan will be returned to the National Assembly for a third reading. Earlier, the National Assembly had already passed the plan in the first and second readings.

    反对法国政府鲸吞撒哈拉地区的阴谋
    新华社30日讯　巴黎消息：法国共和国参议院28日对摩勒政府关于成立所谓“撒哈拉地区联合组织”的计划提出了修正。这个计划规定，把目前分属阿尔及利亚、法属西非洲和法属赤道非洲的“撒哈拉地区”抽出来，成为单一的经济单位，并且在某种程度上成为单一的行政单位，以便于法国加强它对这个地区的资源榨取和政治控制。这个计划已经遭到阿尔及利亚、法属西非洲和法属赤道非洲人民的强烈反对。
    在共和国参议院讨论这个计划的时候，法国总理摩勒特别着重地指出这个地区对法国的经济重要性，这个地区有大量矿藏，包括石油、铀、铜、铁、锰、煤等。
    摩勒说，这个地区在几年内就会为法国生产数百万吨石油。他还说：“撒哈拉同原子能是我们独立的基础之一。”
    由于共和国参议院对法国政府的“撒哈拉地区联合组织”计划提出了修正，这个计划将退回国民议会进行三读审查。早先，国民议会已经一读、二读通过了这个计划。
