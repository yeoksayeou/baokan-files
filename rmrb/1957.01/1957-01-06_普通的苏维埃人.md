    Ordinary Soviet People
    Fire Chief
    On October 20th, Sergeant Smirnov, a fire squad leader from a Moscow fire brigade, received another Order of the Red Star.
    …It was a warm July night, and Smirnov, who was on vacation, was sleeping peacefully at home. However, due to the alertness of firefighters, he seemed to hear cries for help in his dream. So, he immediately got out of bed and rushed out.
    It turned out that a neighbor's house was on fire, and cries for "Help!" were coming from the window on the top floor—the fifth floor.
    Smirnov thought that his comrades would come to put out the fire soon, but he did not hesitate for a moment and immediately climbed up the fire escape ladder installed on the outside wall. It was terrible, the eaves of the wall were broken five meters away from the window, leaving only twenty or thirty centimeters wide. Smirnov pressed his chest against the wall in the swirling smoke, moving his feet towards the window.
    Smirnov finally reached the window. He quickly jumped into the room from the window and found a boy and an old lady, who were hiding in the corner of the room crying in despair. At this time, the door to the corridor was completely engulfed in smoke and fire, and they could not get out. Smirnov grabbed the boy with one hand and jumped out of the window. He carefully and nimbly carried the child across the dangerous narrow eaves, sent the child to the fire escape ladder, and then immediately returned and passed the dangerous road for the third time, rescuing the old lady as well. As soon as he and the old lady left the window, with a bang, the glass on the window shattered, and a tongue of fire spewed out from the window. --Just one second later and everything would have been over.
    The grandmother, grandson, and their savior Smirnov all safely reached the ground. Only at this time did Smirnov realize that he was barefoot.
    Passerby
    Not long ago, on the Second Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street in Moscow, just as a truck was driving fast, a "Victory" car suddenly drove out of an alley. It was about to crash! In order to avoid a car accident, the truck driver suddenly drove the car onto the sidewalk. However, there was a little girl walking on the sidewalk at this time. At that dangerous moment, a pair of quick hands quickly pushed the child into the doorway next to the sidewalk. The girl escaped danger, but the person was injured, and his left leg was broken. Enduring the severe pain, he sat up and asked in his first sentence: "Is the child okay?"
    This person is the Director of the Moscow People's Police Bureau, named Pyotr Pavlovich Matveyev. He happened to be passing by here.
    Switchman
    This incident happened near the Kreshchevka station. One day, while switchman Kinna was on duty, she suddenly found a boy walking on the track, and the train was only seven or eight meters away from him at this time. Kinna didn't hesitate at all and immediately ran to save him. The child was rescued, but Kinna herself fell under the wheels, and her legs were broken.
    Now, Kinna is lying in the hospital, and many people visit her every day. People from all over the Soviet Union write letters to express their condolences. (Attached picture)
    This photo shows Kinna and the five-year-old child Vega she saved.

    普通的苏维埃人
    救火队长
    10月20日，莫斯科一个救火队的分队长斯米尔诺夫中士的胸前又添上了一枚红星勋章。
    ……是一个和暖的7月的夜晚，正在休假的斯米尔诺夫安静地在家里睡觉。可是，由于救火人员的警觉，他在梦中似乎听到了求救的声音。于是，他马上从床上爬起来，冲了出去。
    原来是邻居失火，从那里的最高一层楼——五楼的窗子里发出了“救命”的呼声。
    斯米尔诺夫当时想到，自己的同伴们马上会来救火的，可是他并没有迟疑一下，马上顺着楼外墙上设置的救火梯爬了上去。真糟糕，在离窗子五公尺远的这段墙檐坏了，只剩二、三十公分宽了。斯米尔诺夫在团团烟雾中用胸口紧贴着墙，向窗口移动着脚步。
    斯米尔诺夫终于来到窗前，他迅速地从窗口跳进屋里，找到了一个男孩和一个老太太，他们两个正躲在屋角里绝望地哭泣。这时通往过道的门已经完全被烟火笼罩，走不出去了。斯米尔诺夫一手挟起男孩，跳出窗口。他谨慎敏捷地带着孩子越过了危险的窄墙檐，把孩子送到救火梯上以后马上又折回来，第三次通过险路，把老太太也救了出来。他和老太太刚离开窗口不远，砰的一声，窗上的玻璃就碎了，从窗口吐出了一股火舌。——只有一秒之差就什么都要完了。
    祖母、孙子和他们的救命人斯米尔诺夫都平安地下到了地面。只是在这个时候，斯米尔诺夫才发觉自己原来是光着脚的。
    过路人
    不久前，在莫斯科第二特维尔—雅木街上，正当一辆载重汽车飞快地行驶的时候，突然从小巷里驶出一辆“胜利”牌小汽车。眼看就要撞车了！载重汽车的司机为了避免车祸，把车一下子开上了人行道。可是，这时正好有一个小女孩在人行道上走。就在这危险的一刹那间，一双敏捷的手迅速地把孩子推进了人行道旁边的屋门口。女孩子脱险了，可是这个人受伤了，他的左腿断了。他忍着剧痛，欠起身来，第一句话就问：“孩子没事吧？”
    这个人是莫斯科民警局局长，名叫彼得·巴夫洛维奇·马特维也夫。他是偶然路过这里的。
    扳道员
    这件事发生在克?席夫卡车站附近。一天，当扳道员金娜正在值班的时候，忽然发现有一个男孩子在轨道上走，而这时火车离他只有七、八公尺远了。金娜一点也没犹豫，立刻跑上去救他。孩子是救下来了，可是金娜自己却倒在车轮底下，两条腿被压断了。
    现在，金娜躺在医院里，每天有很多人看望她，苏联各地的人都写信来慰问。（附图片）
    这张照片上就是金娜和她所救活的五岁孩子维加。
