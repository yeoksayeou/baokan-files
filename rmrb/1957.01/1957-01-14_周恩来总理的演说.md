Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Thanks Poland for its support and assistance to China. The people of China and Poland are comrades-in-arms advancing side by side towards the goal of communism. All who strive for peace and socialism are pleased and encouraged by the results of the Soviet-Polish talks.

Some errors and deviations that occurred in Poland's political and economic life in the past cannot obscure the great achievements that have been made, and these errors have now been resolutely corrected. The Polish people will surely be able to defeat the attempts of imperialist elements to strike at Poland's socialist cause under the guise of hypocritical slogans of "democracy" and "freedom." Dear Mayor of Warsaw, Comrade Dworski; Dear Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Comrade Cyrankiewicz; Dear Comrades and Friends:

As I begin my speech, I would like to first extend, on behalf of the Chinese people, warm and fraternal greetings to you, to the dear Polish people!

Two and a half years ago, I had the opportunity to visit your country and personally experienced the fraternal friendship of the Polish people towards the Chinese people. Now, at this grand gathering, I once again feel that the friendship between us is constantly developing.

In the two and a half years since then, cooperation between China and Poland, both in the cause of peace and in the areas of economy and culture, has greatly increased. In this cooperation, our two countries support each other. This cooperation has brought great benefits to the cause of socialist construction of our two peoples. In the future, we are willing to continue to develop this cooperation. Now, taking this opportunity to meet the Polish people in person, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude for the support that the Polish people have given to the Chinese people, thank Poland for its tireless efforts to restore China's legitimate representation in the United Nations, thank Poland for its assistance in ocean shipping, and thank Poland for its technical assistance in industrial construction.

Comrades, friends: As I stand on this podium, the strong impression of Sino-Polish friendship that I received during my first visit to Poland two and a half years ago returns to my mind. I also remember what Comrade Cyrankiewicz said at a similar meeting. He said: "We are separated by thousands of kilometers, our traditions and history are different; the languages we speak are different. But our hearts are close, and we understand each other. Because a common cause and a common struggle have linked us together." Yes, the people of China and Poland are united by our great struggle for the cause of communism, by the common ideological foundation of Marxism-Leninism, and by the spirit of proletarian internationalism. Our two countries are comrades-in-arms in the socialist camp advancing side by side towards the same goal of communism. This fighting friendship between us is noble, unbreakable, and constantly developing and consolidating. We, the Chinese people, cherish this friendship very much, and regard the continuous strengthening of the friendship between the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union as our highest international obligation.

We know from long-term personal experience that the victory of the Chinese revolution and construction is inseparable from the support and assistance of all socialist countries; at the same time, the cause of safeguarding world peace and promoting human progress is also inseparable from the unity and cooperation of all socialist countries. The Chinese government has entrusted me and my comrades to visit the three fraternal countries of the Soviet Union, Poland, and Hungary this time in order to express the Chinese people's deep desire to further strengthen this unity through direct contact with each other.

In our visit that has already begun, we are pleased to see that this is also the common desire of our fraternal countries, and that our mutual unity is being strengthened. Of course, in our mutual relations, there may sometimes be some abnormal states. However, socialist countries are basically interdependent and share common interests, and there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Therefore, this abnormal state can be eliminated. We, the Chinese people, welcome the results of the Soviet-Polish talks in November last year with great satisfaction. This meeting proved that any errors that occur in the mutual relations of socialist countries can be completely corrected through friendly consultation. Now, the whole world sees that in the mutual relations between the Soviet Union and Poland, some dark clouds have dissipated, some misunderstandings have been eliminated, and the Marxist-Leninist principles of national equality and proletarian internationalism have once again stood the test. This makes all those who strive for peace and socialism feel extremely gratified and encouraged. The last time I was in Poland, I was deeply impressed by the great achievements of the Polish people in reconstruction. The heavy destruction of Warsaw by Hitler's fascists during World War II is known to all. However, I personally saw that the heroic people of Warsaw had rebuilt Warsaw with the world-famous "Warsaw speed." The resolute efforts made by the Polish people, united under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, to restore and build their motherland cannot but move everyone who has been to Poland. Relying on this united effort, you have not only healed the serious wounds brought about by the Hitler occupation in a short historical period of less than twelve years, but also transformed an agricultural country into a socialist industrial country. Poland has freed itself from the exploitation and oppression of domestic and foreign capitalists and domestic landlords. Poland's international status has been greatly improved, and it continues to make significant contributions to the cause of peace in Europe and Asia. All these well-known facts fully demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system and encourage the Chinese people who are fighting for socialist construction and the defense of world peace.

Our China is a country with a large population and abundant resources. However, due to the long-term rule of feudalism and the aggression of imperialism, we are still backward in economic and cultural terms. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people are now united as one and are waging an arduous struggle to get rid of our backward state and to build an advanced socialist country. In many ways, Poland is still ahead of us, and we need to learn from you. Although our task is difficult, we have seen the unparalleled superiority and vitality of the socialist system from the achievements made by the Soviet Union, Poland, and other socialist countries. We believe that our socialist countries, through mutual assistance and cooperation, will surely be able to achieve common economic upsurge.

Of course, the road you have traveled is not without twists and turns, and without difficulties, just as we in China have also encountered certain twists and turns and difficulties in the process of development. We know that recently, at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party, some errors and deviations that had occurred in Poland's political and economic life in the past were exposed. However, these errors and deviations can in no way obscure the great achievements made by the Polish working class and the Polish people under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party in healing the wounds of war and building socialism in the past twelve years, and these errors have now been resolutely corrected. We, the Chinese people, have always been closely concerned about the future of Poland's socialist development and the struggle of the Polish people to maintain and improve the cause of socialist construction. Now, we are very happy to see that all the healthy forces in Poland who support socialism are uniting around the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party headed by Comrade Gomulka, and are working hard to promote the socialist cause in Poland.

The socialist system is a new social system, and the working class has managed the country for only a very short time in human history. Because there is not enough experience, it is impossible for us to make no mistakes at all. Mistakes have been made in the past, and mistakes may still be made in the future. In history, no matter which class has seized power, it has made many mistakes, but only the party of the working class and the state led by the working class can conscientiously expose and correct the mistakes in their work for the benefit of the people. This is where our proletarian dictatorship is incomparably superior to the dictatorship of all exploiting classes. We believe that after the mistakes and deviations of the past have been corrected, Poland's socialist cause will surely develop forward more soundly.

Imperialist elements attempt to attack Poland's socialist cause under the guise of hypocritical slogans of "democracy" and "freedom." But this attempt is futile. Comrade Gomulka is right to say: "The freedom of democracy can only belong to the working people who are building a new socialist system, and the enemies of socialism and the power of the working people cannot be allowed to use it." We, the Chinese people, also know from our own experience that only by resolutely implementing revolutionary dictatorship against the enemies of the working people can we guarantee the broadest people's democracy; only by relying on the broadest people's democracy can we implement the most effective dictatorship against the enemies; and only by correctly combining revolutionary dictatorship with the broadest people's democracy can we unite the largest number of people and build socialism. We believe that the Polish working class and the Polish people, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, adhering to the proletarian dictatorship, that is, adhering to socialist democracy, will surely be able to defeat any attempts at provocation and provocation by hostile forces from any direction.

Comrades, friends: In the past two months, I have visited the five countries of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Kingdom of

    周恩来总理的演说
    感谢波兰对中国的支持和援助。　　中、波两国人民是向着共产主义目标并肩前进的战友。　　一切为和平和社会主义而奋斗的人们都为苏波会谈的结果感到欣慰和鼓舞。
    过去在波兰政治和经济生活中发生的一些错误和偏向，不能掩盖已经取得的巨大成绩，而且这些错误现在已得到坚决纠正。　　波兰人民一定可以击破帝国主义分子以虚伪的“民主”和“自由”的口号来打击波兰社会主义事业的企图。亲爱的华沙市长德沃拉科夫斯基同志：亲爱的部长会议主席西伦凯维兹同志：亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    在我开始讲话的时候，我首先要以中国人民的名义向你们，向亲爱的波兰人民致热烈的、兄弟的敬礼！
    两年半以前，我曾经有机会访问过你们的国家，亲身体会到了波兰人民对中国人民的兄弟友谊。现在，在这样盛大的集会上，我又一次体会到我们之间的友谊正在不断地发展。
    两年半以来，中国和波兰无论在和平事业方面的合作和在经济和文化方面的合作都大大地增进了。在这种合作中我们两国是互相支持的。这种合作对我们两国人民建设社会主义的事业带来了很大的好处。在今后，我们愿意继续发展这种合作。现在，乘这个与波兰人民亲自见面的机会，我要特别对波兰人民给予中国人民的支持表示衷心的感谢，感谢波兰为恢复中国在联合国中的合法代表权所作的不倦努力，感谢波兰在远洋航运方面给我们的支援，感谢波兰在工业建设方面给我们的技术援助。
    同志们，朋友们：当我站在这个讲坛上的时候，两年半以前我第一次访问波兰的时候所得到的中波友谊的强烈印象又回到了我的眼前。我还记得在一次同样的大会上西伦凯维兹同志所说过的话。他说：“我们相隔有几千公里，我们的传统和历史是不同的；我们所说的语言是不同的。但是，我们的心是亲近的，我们是彼此了解的。因为共同的事业和共同的斗争把我们联系了起来。”是的，我们中国和波兰两国人民是由我们为共产主义事业而进行的伟大斗争团结在一起的，是由马克思列宁主义这个共同的思想基础团结在一起的，是由无产阶级的国际主义精神团结在一起的。我们两个国家是在社会主义阵营内向着共产主义这个同一目标并肩前进的战友。我们之间的这种战斗友谊是崇高的、牢不可破的、日益发展和巩固的。我们中国人民十分珍视这种友谊，并且把不断加强以苏联为首的各社会主义国家之间的友谊看成是我们最高的国际义务。
    我们从长期的切身经验中知道：中国革命和建设的胜利是同一切社会主义国家的支持和援助分不开的；同时，维护世界和平和促进人类进步的事业，也是同一切社会主义国家的团结和合作分不开的。中国政府这次委托我和我的同志们来访问苏联、波兰和匈牙利三个兄弟国家，就是为了要通过相互间的直接接触，来表达中国人民对于进一步加强这种团结的深切愿望。
    在我们已经开始的访问中，我们满意地看到这也是我们各兄弟国家的共同愿望，而我们相互之间的团结也正在加强。当然，在我们相互间的关系上，有时也会发生某些不正常状态。但是，社会主义国家在基本上是休戚相关、利害与共的，而不存在任何根本的利害矛盾和冲突的。因此，这种不正常状态是能够消除的。我们中国人民以十分满意的心情欢迎去年11月苏波会谈的结果。这次会谈证明，社会主义国家的互相关系中所发生的任何错误都是完全能够经过友好协商而得到纠正的。现在，全世界都看到，在苏联和波兰的相互关系上，一些阴云消散了，一些误解消除了，马克思列宁主义关于民族平等和无产阶级国际主义的原则再一次经受了考验。这使一切为和平和社会主义而奋斗的人们都感到极大的欣慰和鼓舞。我上次在波兰的时候，就对波兰人民恢复建设的伟大成就留下了难忘的印象。华沙在第二次世界大战期间受希特勒法西斯破坏的惨重是无人不知的。然而，我亲自看到英勇的华沙人民已经以举世闻名的“华沙速度”把华沙重建起来。波兰人民在波兰统一工人党领导下团结一致地为恢复和建设自己的祖国所作出的坚毅努力，使每一个到过波兰的人都不能不为之感动。依靠着这种团结一致的努力，你们在不到十二年的短短历史时期内，不仅医治了希特勒占领时期所带来的严重创伤，而且把一个农业国变为一个社会主义工业国。波兰已经摆脱了国内外资本家和本国地主的剥削和压迫。波兰的国际地位已经有了极大的提高，它不断对欧洲和亚洲的和平事业作出重大的贡献。所有这些众所周知的事实，充分地证明了社会主义制度的优越性，鼓舞了为建设社会主义和保卫世界和平而斗争的中国人民。
    我们中国是一个人口众多和资源丰富的国家。然而，由于长期受到封建主义的统治和帝国主义的侵略，我们在经济上和文化上直到现在还是落后的。中国人民现在正在中国共产党的领导下团结一致，为摆脱我们的这种落后状态，为建设一个先进的社会主义国家而进行艰苦的斗争。在许多方面，波兰还走在我们的前头，我们需要向你们好好地学习。虽然我们的任务是困难的，但是，从苏联、波兰和其他各社会主义国家所达到的成就中，我们看到了社会主义制度无比的优越性和生命力。我们相信，我们社会主义各国，通过互相的援助和合作，一定能够达到共同的经济高涨。
    当然，你们所经历的道路并不是没有曲折、没有困难的，正如我们中国在发展的过程中也曾遇到过某些曲折和困难一样。我们知道，最近，在波兰统一工人党的八中全会上，曾经揭发了过去在波兰政治和经济生活中发生过的一些错误和偏向。但是，这些错误和偏向无论如何也不能掩盖过去十二年内波兰工人阶级和波兰人民在波兰统一工人党领导下医治了战争创伤和建设了社会主义的巨大成绩，而且，这些错误现在已经得到坚决的纠正。我们中国人民一直密切地关怀着波兰的社会主义的发展前途，关怀着波兰人民为维护和改进社会主义建设事业而进行的斗争。现在，我们很高兴地看到，波兰的一切拥护社会主义的健康力量正团结在以哥穆尔卡同志为首的波兰统一工人党中央委员会的周围，为推进波兰的社会主义事业而努力。
    社会主义制度是一种新的社会制度，工人阶级管理国家在人类历史上还只有一个极短的时间。由于经验还不够，我们要完全不犯错误是不可能的。过去犯过错误，今后也还可能犯错误。在历史上，不论那一个掌握政权的阶级都犯过不少的错误，但是，只有工人阶级的政党和工人阶级领导的国家，才能够认真地为着人民的利益来揭发并且纠正自己工作中的错误，这就是我们无产阶级专政比一切剥削阶级的专政优越得不可比拟的地方。我们相信，在过去的错误和偏向得到了纠正以后，波兰的社会主义事业一定能够更健全地向前发展。
    帝国主义分子企图以虚伪的“民主”和“自由”的口号来打击波兰的社会主义事业。但是这种企图是徒然的。哥穆尔卡同志说得对：“民主的自由只能够属于建设社会主义新制度的劳动人民，不能容许社会主义和劳动人民政权的敌人来利用它。”我们中国人民也从自己的经验中知道，只有坚决地对劳动人民的敌人实行革命的专政，才能保证最广泛的人民民主；只有依靠最广泛的人民民主，才能够对敌人实行最有效的专政；而只有把革命的专政同最广泛的人民民主正确地结合起来，才能够团结最大多数人民，建设社会主义。我们相信，在波兰统一工人党领导下的波兰工人阶级和波兰人民，坚持无产阶级专政，也就是坚持社会主义民主，一定可以击破不管来自任何方面的敌对力量的任何挑拨和挑衅的企图。
    同志们，朋友们：在过去的两个月中，我曾访问了亚洲南部的越南民主共和国、柬埔寨王国、印度共和国、缅甸联邦、巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国五个国家，有机会接触了那里广泛阶层的人民。虽然这些国家的社会和政治制度是不同的，然而，他们的人民强烈地要求保卫世界和平、反对战争、要求维护民族独立、反对殖民主义的愿望是完全一致的。通过这次访问，我又一次亲身体验到了十六万万亚非人民曾经在万隆会议上表现出来的这种共同愿望。现在我又到欧洲我们的兄弟国家来访问，又亲身体验到了我们九万万社会主义国家人民团结一致建设社会主义、维护世界和平、反对帝国主义挑衅的决心。我深深感到社会主义的力量、民族独立的力量和世界上一切爱好和平的力量，远远超过了帝国主义侵略集团的力量。帝国主义侵略集团几个月以前对匈牙利进行的颠覆活动和对埃及发动的武装侵略，表现了帝国主义一时的猖狂。但是，现在大家都可以看到，在社会主义国家和世界上一切爱好和平的各国人民的坚决反击下，帝国主义在匈牙利的颠覆活动和对埃及的武装侵略都已经可耻地失败了。
    当然，帝国主义对于它们的失败是决不会甘心的。现在美国正在打着“艾森豪威尔主义”的旗子，企图代替英法的地位，奴役中近东人民，制造紧张局势。西德的复仇主义的军国主义势力的活动也更加猖狂起来。帝国主义国家对我们社会主义国家的破坏活动从来就没有停止过，现在更是变本加厉了。这种情况说明，为了保卫世界和平，全世界爱好和平的人民还需要同帝国主义进行长期的反复的斗争。但是，全世界人民都要和平，而不要和平的只是少数帝国主义国家中依靠侵略发财的垄断资本集团。只要我们社会主义国家和世界上一切爱好和平的力量团结一致，坚持斗争，和平和社会主义事业的最后胜利是谁也阻挡不了的。
    波兰人民共和国万岁！
    波兰统一工人党万岁！
    中波两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结万岁！
    世界人民大团结万岁！
    和平和社会主义万岁！　　　　　　　　　　（新华社）
