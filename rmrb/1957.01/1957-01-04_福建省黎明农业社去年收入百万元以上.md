(Our Fuzhou dispatch) Fujian Province's first "millionaire cooperative"—the Liming Agricultural Cooperative in Haicheng County—achieved a total income of over one million and two thousand yuan in 1956. The remuneration for each workday was over two yuan, and 91% of the cooperative members increased their income.

The cooperative has a total of one thousand two hundred and thirty-six households, located in the lower reaches of the Jiulong River, with fertile land and more than seven thousand seven hundred and sixty mu of paddy fields. Although the foundation was relatively good, the reason why the total income of the cooperative could reach more than one million yuan was mainly the result of the collective management of the advanced cooperative. This cooperative was threatened by drought in 1956. However, thanks to the construction of many water conservancy projects by the cooperative, the drought was basically eliminated. In addition, with the implementation of various advanced farming techniques, the average yield of rice per mu reached one thousand four hundred and fifty-five jin, an increase of 40% compared with 1955 when advanced cooperation was not realized, and an increase of 48% compared with the highest yield before the war. Sideline production also developed in 1956. For the first time, fish were raised in all the large and small rivers and harbors in the township, and more than 30,000 fish were raised in the cooperative. In addition to the income from pig breeding and orchards, the total income from sideline production for the year was nearly 130,000 yuan. At the same time, due to the implementation of the policy of running the cooperative diligently and frugally, relying on the members to tap local fertilizer resources, the production cost was reduced by about 30% compared with the past. Therefore, the actual income of the members increased rapidly. In 1956, the yield per unit area of rice increased by 16% compared with 1954, which was a relatively good year, while the income of a full laborer increased by more than double that time, and the average income of each full laborer in the cooperative was 320 yuan in 1956.

    福建省黎明农业社去年收入百万元以上
    本报福州电　福建省首次出现的“百万富翁社”——海澄县黎明农业社，1956年的总收入达到了一百万零二千多元，每个劳动日的报酬在两元以上，有91％的社员都增加了收入。
    全社共有一千二百三十六户，地处九龙江下游，土地肥沃，有七千七百六十多亩水田。虽然基础较好，但全社总收入所以能达到百万元以上，主要还是高级社集体经营的结果。这个社在1956年曾受到旱灾的威胁。可是由于社里兴修了许多水利工程，基本上消除了旱象。加上推行各项先进耕作技术，全社水稻每亩平均产量达到一千四百五十五斤，比1955年没有实现高级合作化的时候，增产了40％，比战前最高产量增加了48％。副业生产1956年也有了发展，全乡大小河港第一次养了鱼，全社共养鱼三万多尾。再加上养猪、果林等方面的收入，全年副业总收入近十三万元。同时，由于贯彻了勤俭办社的方针，依靠社员发掘地方肥源，生产成本比过去降低了30％左右。因此，社员的实际收入增加很快。1956年水稻单位面积产量，比年成较好的1954年增产16％，而一个全劳力的收入，却比那个时候增加了一倍以上，全社平均每个全劳力1956年收入了三百二十元。
