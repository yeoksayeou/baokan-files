Starting from "Is it Like Peking Opera?"
Du Shijun

On July 29th of last year, the People's Daily published an article by Comrade Wu Zuguang about the "Three Big Mountains" of Peking Opera, which touched upon the question of "Is it Like Peking Opera?". The gist of this article on this issue can be summarized as follows: the beginning and end of the Peking Opera "Three Big Mountains" do not resemble Peking Opera, hence the style is inconsistent. It would be better to simply abandon the question of "Is it Like Peking Opera?" to unify the entire style. This would create a new opera with national characteristics.

This statement sounds pleasing at first. Wouldn't it be great to get rid of a long-standing and confusing problem and create a new genre of opera? Unfortunately, it's not that simple. Even if this idea could be realized, what would happen to Peking Opera if Peking Opera workers were to create a new opera?

Why do Comrade Wu Zuguang and others have this proposition? The reason is probably this: it is difficult to reform Peking Opera and still make it look like Peking Opera; it is easy to reform Peking Opera and not have it look like Peking Opera. The former path is very narrow, while the latter path can be reckless. It is a pity that what comes out of this reckless charge does not resemble Peking Opera. Because it is not Peking Opera at all, there is no question of "resemblance." At best, this is just a replacement. It does not solve the problems inherent in Peking Opera itself.

This is not to say that I am against Peking Opera absorbing elements from other genres. However, absorption must be digested and transformed into its own flesh and blood. We only need to compare Peking Opera's "Chun Qiu Pei" and "Cui Ping Shan" with these two plays in Bangzi Opera to see the origins of Peking Opera's absorption of nutrients from Bangzi Opera. However, these two Peking Opera plays still resemble Peking Opera. Perhaps there were some parts that did not resemble Peking Opera at the beginning, or were like the "Three Big Mountains" today, with many parts that did not resemble Peking Opera, but the senior Peking Opera artists did not settle for this. After much painstaking effort, they finally achieved today's accomplishments. Peking Opera itself has thus been enriched and developed. Wouldn't it be easier to simply move it over and sing it as it is in Bangzi Opera? The senior artists did not do this. Because the principle is too obvious and simple, how could Peking Opera not resemble Peking Opera?

At present, new Peking Opera plays, especially those depicting modern life, will inevitably have parts that do not resemble Peking Opera. This is an inevitable phenomenon and is not a cause for concern. Stylistic inconsistencies will gradually be unified over time and through effort. However, the direction of this effort should not be taken lightly. If we simply let it become less and less like Peking Opera because there are phenomena that do not resemble Peking Opera, then it would be biased. This direction would be off by more than a hair's breadth, and the error will be more than a thousand miles.

In recent years, Peking Opera can be said to have been a great success, winning glory for the motherland. Recently, many old plays have been restored. And unhealthy and unreasonable things such as foot-binding and drinking on stage have been removed. Can we stop talking about reform? No.

Anything with life will degenerate and gradually die if it does not have the function of metabolism. This principle is clear to everyone. Peking Opera certainly cannot escape this law. As a work of art, such as a painting, it can be preserved in a museum for future generations to admire and learn from. As an art form, whether it is oil painting or watercolor painting, it will perish if it does not develop. Imagine, if we freeze Peking Opera as it is, wouldn't it really be like what "Old Lady Nine Catty" said: "Each generation is not as good as the last"? Some people have already lamented that "today's Tan (Fuying) is not as good as the former Tan (Xinpei)," so future Peking Opera audiences will regard reminiscing about Tan Fuying as a kind of enjoyment. Can we imagine what will happen if we continue to push this forward? In short, "Si Lang Visits His Mother" and "Luo Ma Lake" will never make Peking Opera immortal. The idea of treating Peking Opera as an antique and the idea of "replacement" mentioned earlier are like the North and South Poles, but they are equally harmful to Peking Opera itself.

Some people compare Peking Opera to "Tangram," which is a derogation rather than a compliment. Although "Tangram" makes people feel that it is very clever and interesting because it can display various patterns, art cannot rely on cleverness to create. No matter how you piece it together, it is always the same old thing, and people will get tired of it sooner or later. Many newly created Peking Operas before liberation gave people the feeling of "eating a mixed platter." Of course, Peking Opera's "boards" are not just seven pieces. There are also many "boards" that have not yet been used to the point of being clichéd. In terms of singing, such as the five-character sentence in the first section of "Yuan Men Zhan Zi," the half-cut tune of "Ting Ba Yan Lai Xiao Kai Huai," the chorus of Sheng and Jing, and the round singing of Sheng, Dan, and Jing in "Er Jin Gong." In terms of action, such as the movements of Fan Zhongyu and the woodcutter in "Wen Qiao," and the opening fight of "Yi Feng Shu" in "Yan Yang Lou," etc. There are many more. These are rarely seen, or even unseen, in other plays. But if it enters the "mixed platter," it will naturally have a day when it is overused. And this cannot be considered creation. Art without creation cannot be art. Like moving the singing method of raising the tone of "Shi Cai Jian Yu Qian Sui..." from the bottom to the top in "Yuan Men Zhan Zi" to "Chun Qiu Bi," or moving the singing method of "Jian Fen Tai Bu You Ren..." in "Mu Yang Juan" to "Su Wu Mu Yang," these are just ways of borrowing a corpse to return the soul. The same is true for the current problem of creating new plays. For example, a "Hunting Tiger" can use the reading of "Pu Deng E" from "Wu Ren Yi" to replace "Bao Jia Men." If another play also starts by reading "Pu Deng E," and the third also starts by reading "Pu Deng E," please imagine what the situation will be like? However, this method of piecing together the "Tangram" is still better than the previous two propositions, and it can still save the urgent situation for a while; although it is not a long-term solution.

So what is the long-term solution? If we can also borrow the not-so-appropriate metaphor of "Tangram," then what we need is to create the eighth, ninth, and so on... piece. This is the only way to make Peking Opera move forward and conform to the meaning of "bringing forth the new from the old."

What is this eighth piece? It resembles Peking Opera, it is Peking Opera, but it is not the original form of Peking Opera. To be more specific, we can give an example: many of the actions in "Luo Shengjiao" are moved from plays with water capture plots such as "Hua Hu Die" and "Ying Xiong Yi." However, there are also some actions that have not been seen in Peking Opera. Because this play is to show saving a person in the water, not two people fighting in the water, the water capture set cannot do the job, so new things are created. These actions may not be refined enough, but it can be seen as the prototype of the eighth piece.

In fact, Peking Opera, as well as any art form, cannot be very rich when it is first born. It must be gradually achieved through the accumulation of countless artists' efforts. According to legend, the tune of "Gui Fei Zui Jiu" was created by Mr. Mei Yutian, the ancestor of Mr. Mei Lanfang. The "Fan Xipi" singing style was created by Mr. Tan Xinpei, the ancestor of Mr. Tan Fuying. Today, these have become part of the original seven pieces. In those days, wouldn't they also appear in the form of the eighth piece? Examples like this are too numerous to mention.

The creation of this eighth piece must first rely on artists, especially old artists. Because if you are not familiar with the original seven pieces, it is difficult for the eighth piece to fall from the sky. However, the scope of this eighth piece is very broad, and all experts in drama, music, dance, fine arts, and lighting must lend a hand. But there is one prerequisite: you must be familiar with the original seven pieces.

Where should this eighth piece start? Where is the starting point for creating it? From the examples above, it can be seen that new things are created because the original ones are not enough. The saving of people in the water in "Luo Shengjiao" has been mentioned above. The tune of "Gui Fei Zui Jiu" was obviously created to express the mood of palace life. This play originally has no dramatic plot, but the poetry of the whole play is very strong. If these tunes were all replaced with the "Xiao Kai Men" and "Liu Yao Jin" that are common in Peking Opera, I am afraid that it would not be passed down to this day. From this, it can be inferred that the starting point for creating the eighth piece should be the script. Having a new script is equivalent to putting forward new requirements for the existing Peking Opera. In order to meet this requirement, new things will naturally be produced.

Speaking of this, it touches on the question of whether Peking Opera can express modern life. There are many people who say that Peking Opera cannot express modern life. Many people say that it is "frozen" and "rigid." We can look at this issue by reviewing the Ping Opera. In addition to singing, the costumes, props, and percussion of Ping Opera are mostly the same as those of Peking Opera. I have seen Ping Opera's "Hong Luan Xi." If you block your ears, it is difficult to distinguish how much difference there is from Peking Opera. And there are many small plays in Peking Opera, such as "Xiao Fang Niu," "Da Mian Gang," "Xiao Shang Fen," "Tan Qin Jia," "Da Ying Tao," and so on. Taking the ones mentioned here as an example, each one has its unique tune. Plays such as "Da Cheng Huang" and "Shuang Bei Deng" do not even have a single song. Using these (of course, not in their original form) to perform "Xiao Nv Xu" and "Liu Qiao Er," at the very least, it would have its own merits compared to Ping Opera, right?

The small plays mentioned above are only the plays of the three smalls (Xiao Sheng, Xiao Dan, Xiao Chou), but they are only a part of Peking Opera, and a small part. What about the rest of the large part? There is a "bridge" problem here. This "bridge" was broken in the Qing Dynasty. "Peng Gong An" and "Shi Gong An" were originally contemporary stories of the Qing Dynasty, but they wore Ming Dynasty costumes. Although there were also Qing Dynasty costume dramas such as "Huan Hai Chao" and "Ma Si Yuan," the number was originally small, and later they almost disappeared. Plays of the Republic of China era, such as "Qiang Bi Yan Ruisheng," although it caused a sensation in Shanghai, also died out quickly. The civilized dramas of Zhang Xiaoying and others were not the mainstream, so they could not last long. In fact, modern history such as "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," "Wuxu Coup," and "Hongxian Pseudo-Dynasty" are all excellent subjects for Peking Opera scripts. If this "bridge" can be built, the appearance of suits, Zhongshan suits, cheongsams, and even cadre uniforms on the Peking Opera stage will no longer feel abrupt. And in the process of building this "bridge," Peking Opera itself will inevitably grow stronger. As a Peking Opera audience, I sincerely hope that comrades with the ability in this area will bring out more things.

### 从“像不像京戏”谈起

    从“像不像京戏”谈起
    杜士俊
    去年7月29日人民日报发表了吴祖光同志一篇关于京戏“三座山”的文章，接触到了“像不像京戏”的问题。这篇文章中关于这问题的主旨可以概括如下：京戏“三座山”首尾不像京戏，因此风格不统一。不如索性抛开“像不像京戏”的问题，使整个风格统一起来。这样更会创造出一种具有民族特色的新歌剧来。
    这说法初听起来使人觉得痛快。既可以摆脱一个久久纠缠不清的问题，又可以出现一个新的剧种，岂不是好事？无奈，并不这样简单。就算这想法果真能实现吧，让京戏工作者去创造新歌剧，置京戏于何地呢？
    为什么吴祖光同志以及别的人们会有这种主张呢？那原因恐怕是在这里：改革京戏而仍要像京戏，这很困难；改革京戏而可以不像京戏，这就容易。前一条路窄的很，而后一条路却可以横冲直撞。只可惜这冲撞出来的东西不像京戏。因为它根本不是京戏，当然也就谈不到“像”了。这样搞，充其量也只是代替。解决不了京戏本身存在的问题。
    这样说，并不是反对京戏吸收其它剧种的东西。但吸收必须经过消化，变成自己的血肉才成。我们 只要把京戏“春秋配”、“翠屏山”和梆子中的这两出戏比较一下，便可看出京戏从梆子吸取营养的许多来龙去脉。不过京戏中的这两出戏仍然像京戏。也许当初有些不像京戏的地方，或者正像今天的“三座山”一样，有很多地方不像京戏，前辈的京戏艺人却不就此心安理得，经过许多苦心经营，终于达到今天的成就。京戏本身也因此而丰富了，发展了。若硬搬过来，就照梆子的原样来演唱，岂不省事？前辈艺人却不这样做。因为道理太明显而且简单了，京戏怎么能不像京戏？
    目前京戏的新剧目，特别是表现现代生活的新剧目，很难一下子就没有不像京戏的地方。这本是难免的现象，也是不足为虑的。风格上的不统一必须经过时间，经过努力才会逐渐统一起来。但这努力的方向却轻率不得。倘若因有不像京戏的现象而就此索性让它越不像京戏越好，则未免失之偏颇。这方向也就差之不只毫厘，谬之亦将不仅千里了。
    几年来京戏可以说轰轰烈烈，为祖国争光不少。最近又恢复了许多旧剧目。而且像踩跷、饮场等不健康的，不合理的东西都已去掉。是否就可以不再谈改革了呢？不行。
    任何有生命的东西，倘没有了新陈代谢的作用就会生机退化，渐趋死亡。这道理是大家都明白的。京戏当然也不能逃出这规律。作为一件艺术品，例如一张画，可以保存在博物院供后人欣赏学习。作为一个艺术种类，无论是油画或是水彩画，倘不发展就要灭亡。请设想，若把京戏原封不动地冻结起来，那岂不真会如“九斤老太”说的：“一代不如一代”了吗？早就有人发出过“今谭（富英）不如昔谭（鑫培）”的感慨，那么将来的京戏观众也会把回忆谭富英当成一种享受了。这样推下去，还堪设想吗？总之，“四郎探母”、“落马湖”绝不会使京戏长生不老的。把京戏当做古董的主张和前面所说的“代替”的主张，恰如南北两极，但其对京戏本身有害无益却是相同的。
    有人把京戏比做“七巧板”，这是贬而不是褒。“七巧板”虽因能摆出各种图样来，使人觉得它很巧，很有意思；艺术却不能靠巧来进行创造。拼来拼去总是那老一套，早晚会让人厌烦的。解放前有许多新编的京戏就有给人“吃拼盘”的感觉。京戏的“板”当然不仅七块。也有很多尚未用得陈腐不堪的“板”。在唱法上如：“辕门斩子”第一段的五字句，“听罢言来笑开怀”的半截腔，“二进宫”的生净齐唱及生旦净轮唱。在动作上如：“问樵”的范仲禹与樵夫的身段，“艳阳楼”的“一封书”开打等等多的很。这些都是在别的戏里很少见，甚至见不着的。但若一旦入了“拼盘”自然也会有用滥了的一天。并且这总不能算是创造。而艺术离开创造也就不成其为艺术。像把“辕门斩子”中的“适才间与千岁……”从底调翻高的唱法搬到“春秋笔”里，或把“牧羊卷”中的“见坟台不由人……”倒板转反二簧的唱法搬到“苏武牧羊”里，这都只是借尸还魂的办法。当前创造新剧目的问题上也同样如此。例如有一个“猎虎记”可以套用“五人义”的念“扑灯蛾”，来代替“报家门”。若再有一个别的什么戏也开场就念“扑灯蛾”，第三个也开场就念“扑灯蛾”，请想那将会成为什么局面？不过这个拼“七巧板”的办法总还比前两个主张强一些，总还可以救一时之急；虽然也不是长久之计。
    那么怎样是长久之计呢？假如我们也可借用“七巧板”这个不十分妥切的譬喻的话，则我们所需要的就是创造出第八块，第九块，第……块来。这样才能使京剧向前发展，才能符合“推陈出新”的意义。
    这第八块是什么呢？它像京戏，是京戏，却又不是京戏的原封原样。为了说的具体些，可以举个例子：“罗盛教”中有很多动作是从“花蝴蝶”、“英雄义”等有水擒情节的戏中搬过来的。但其中也有些动作是京戏中没有见过的。因为这戏是要表现在水中救一个人，而不是两人在水中相打，水擒的那一套不能胜任了，于是新的东西创造出来了。这些动作也许还不够精练，但做为第八块的雏形来看总是可以的。
    其实京戏以及任何艺术种类在初降生时都不可能是很丰富的。一定要经过无数艺术家的心血日积月累，才能逐渐有成就。据传说，“贵妃醉酒”的曲牌是梅兰芳先生的祖先梅雨田先生创造出来的。“反西皮”的唱腔是谭富英先生的祖先谭鑫培先生创造出来的。今天来看，这些都已成为原来七块之中的了。在当日又何尝不也是以第八块的姿态出现的呢？像这样的例子是不胜枚举的。
    这第八块的创造当然要首先依靠艺人，尤其是老艺人。因为倘不熟悉原来的七块，第八块是很难从天上掉下来的。可是这第八块包括的范围很广，所有的戏剧、音乐、舞蹈、美术、灯光等专家们都要伸一把手才行。但有一个先决条件，必须熟悉原来的七块。
    这第八块要从哪里开始呢？哪里是创造它的起点呢？从上面举的例子可以看出，新的东西是因为原有的不敷应用才创造出来的。“罗盛教”的在水里救人前面已经说过了。“贵妃醉酒”的曲牌显然也是为了表现后宫生活情调而产生的。这出戏本来没有什么戏剧性的情节，全剧的诗意却很浓厚。要把这些曲牌全都换成京戏中常见的“小开门”、“柳摇金”等，恐怕也不会传流到今天。由此可以推论出，创造第八块的起点应该是剧本。有了新的剧本就等于对现有的京戏提出了新的要求。为了满足这要求，新的东西自然会产生出来。
    谈到这里就接触到京戏能否表现现代生活的问题。说京戏不能表现现代生活的大有人在。有不少人都说它“凝固”了，“僵化”了。我们可以借评戏来看看这问题。评戏除了唱腔之外，服装、道具以及打击乐，大部与京戏相同。我曾看过评戏“鸿鸾禧”，假如堵上耳朵来看，很难分辨出和京戏的差异有多少。而且京戏中有很多小戏如：“小放牛”、“打面缸”、“小上坟”、“探亲家”、“打樱桃”等等多的很。就以这里所举的来说，每一出都有其独特的曲调。像“打城隍”、“双背凳”等戏更是连一句唱都没有。利用这些（当然不是原封不动）来演出“小女婿”“刘巧儿”等，最少也会与评戏各有千秋吧？
    以上所说的小戏只是三小（小生、小旦、小丑）的戏，不过是京戏的一部分，而且是一小部分。其余的一大部分怎么办呢？这里存在着一个“桥梁”问题。这“桥梁”在清朝就已经断了。“彭公案”、“施公案”本来都是清朝当代的故事，却穿着明朝的服装。虽也有“宦海潮”、“马思远”等清代服装戏。但为数本来就不多，后来更是差不多绝迹了。民国时代的戏，像“枪毙阎瑞生”虽曾在上海轰动一时，也很快就夭折了。张笑影等人的文明戏本非正流，也就不可能支持多久。其实近代史中如“太平天国”“戊戌政变”“洪宪伪朝”都是京戏剧本的上好题材。若能把这条“桥梁”搭上，京戏舞台上再出现西装、中山装、旗袍以至干部服，就不会再使人感到突兀了。而且在这搭“桥梁”的过程中，京戏本身也必然会长得更茁壮些。做为一个京戏观众，我衷心希望在这方面有能力的同志们多拿些东西出来。
