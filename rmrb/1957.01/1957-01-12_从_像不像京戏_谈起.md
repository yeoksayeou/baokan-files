Starting from "Is it Like Peking Opera?"
Du Shijun

On July 29th of last year, the People's Daily published an article by Comrade Wu Zuguang about the "Three Big Mountains" of Peking Opera, which touched upon the question of "Is it Like Peking Opera?". The gist of this article on this issue can be summarized as follows: the beginning and end of the Peking Opera "Three Big Mountains" do not resemble Peking Opera, hence the style is inconsistent. It would be better to simply abandon the question of "Is it Like Peking Opera?" to unify the entire style. This would create a new opera with national characteristics.

This statement sounds pleasing at first. Wouldn't it be great to get rid of a long-standing and confusing problem and create a new genre of opera? Unfortunately, it's not that simple. Even if this idea could be realized, what would happen to Peking Opera if Peking Opera workers were to create a new opera?

Why do Comrade Wu Zuguang and others have this proposition? The reason is probably this: it is difficult to reform Peking Opera and still make it look like Peking Opera; it is easy to reform Peking Opera and not have it look like Peking Opera. The former path is very narrow, while the latter path can be reckless. It is a pity that what comes out of this reckless charge does not resemble Peking Opera. Because it is not Peking Opera at all, there is no question of "resemblance." At best, this is just a replacement. It does not solve the problems inherent in Peking Opera itself.

This is not to say that I am against Peking Opera absorbing elements from other genres. However, absorption must be digested and transformed into its own flesh and blood. We only need to compare Peking Opera's "Chun Qiu Pei" and "Cui Ping Shan" with these two plays in Bangzi Opera to see the origins of Peking Opera's absorption of nutrients from Bangzi Opera. However, these two Peking Opera plays still resemble Peking Opera. Perhaps there were some parts that did not resemble Peking Opera at the beginning, or were like the "Three Big Mountains" today, with many parts that did not resemble Peking Opera, but the senior Peking Opera artists did not settle for this. After much painstaking effort, they finally achieved today's accomplishments. Peking Opera itself has thus been enriched and developed. Wouldn't it be easier to simply move it over and sing it as it is in Bangzi Opera? The senior artists did not do this. Because the principle is too obvious and simple, how could Peking Opera not resemble Peking Opera?

At present, new Peking Opera plays, especially those depicting modern life, will inevitably have parts that do not resemble Peking Opera. This is an inevitable phenomenon and is not a cause for concern. Stylistic inconsistencies will gradually be unified over time and through effort. However, the direction of this effort should not be taken lightly. If we simply let it become less and less like Peking Opera because there are phenomena that do not resemble Peking Opera, then it would be biased. This direction would be off by more than a hair's breadth, and the error will be more than a thousand miles.

In recent years, Peking Opera can be said to have been a great success, winning glory for the motherland. Recently, many old plays have been restored. And unhealthy and unreasonable things such as foot-binding and drinking on stage have been removed. Can we stop talking about reform? No.

Anything with life will degenerate and gradually die if it does not have the function of metabolism. This principle is clear to everyone. Peking Opera certainly cannot escape this law. As a work of art, such as a painting, it can be preserved in a museum for future generations to admire and learn from. As an art form, whether it is oil painting or watercolor painting, it will perish if it does not develop. Imagine, if we freeze Peking Opera as it is, wouldn't it really be like what "Old Lady Nine Catty" said: "Each generation is not as good as the last"? Some people have already lamented that "today's Tan (Fuying) is not as good as the former Tan (Xinpei)," so future Peking Opera audiences will regard reminiscing about Tan Fuying as a kind of enjoyment. Can we imagine what will happen if we continue to push this forward? In short, "Si Lang Visits His Mother" and "Luo Ma Lake" will never make Peking Opera immortal. The idea of treating Peking Opera as an antique and the idea of "replacement" mentioned earlier are like the North and South Poles, but they are equally harmful to Peking Opera itself.

Some people compare Peking Opera to "Tangram," which is a derogation rather than a compliment. Although "Tangram" makes people feel that it is very clever and interesting because it can display various patterns, art cannot rely on cleverness to create. No matter how you piece it together, it is always the same old thing, and people will get tired of it sooner or later. Many newly created Peking Operas before liberation gave people the feeling of "eating a mixed platter." Of course, Peking Opera's "boards" are not just seven pieces. There are also many "boards" that have not yet been used to the point of being clich√©d. In terms of singing, such as the five-character sentence in the first section of "Yuan Men Zhan Zi," the half-cut tune of "Ting Ba Yan Lai Xiao Kai Huai," the chorus of Sheng and Jing, and the round singing of Sheng, Dan, and Jing in "Er Jin Gong." In terms of action, such as the movements of Fan Zhongyu and the woodcutter in "Wen Qiao," and the opening fight of "Yi Feng Shu" in "Yan Yang Lou," etc. There are many more. These are rarely seen, or even unseen, in other plays. But if it enters the "mixed platter," it will naturally have a day when it is overused. And this cannot be considered creation. Art without creation cannot be art. Like moving the singing method of raising the tone of "Shi Cai Jian Yu Qian Sui..." from the bottom to the top in "Yuan Men Zhan Zi" to "Chun Qiu Bi," or moving the singing method of "Jian Fen Tai Bu You Ren..." in "Mu Yang Juan" to "Su Wu Mu Yang," these are just ways of borrowing a corpse to return the soul. The same is true for the current problem of creating new plays. For example, a "Hunting Tiger" can use the reading of "Pu Deng E" from "Wu Ren Yi" to replace "Bao Jia Men." If another play also starts by reading "Pu Deng E," and the third also starts by reading "Pu Deng E," please imagine what the situation will be like? However, this method of piecing together the "Tangram" is still better than the previous two propositions, and it can still save the urgent situation for a while; although it is not a long-term solution.

So what is the long-term solution? If we can also borrow the not-so-appropriate metaphor of "Tangram," then what we need is to create the eighth, ninth, and so on... piece. This is the only way to make Peking Opera move forward and conform to the meaning of "bringing forth the new from the old."

What is this eighth piece? It resembles Peking Opera, it is Peking Opera, but it is not the original form of Peking Opera. To be more specific, we can give an example: many of the actions in "Luo Shengjiao" are moved from plays with water capture plots such as "Hua Hu Die" and "Ying Xiong Yi." However, there are also some actions that have not been seen in Peking Opera. Because this play is to show saving a person in the water, not two people fighting in the water, the water capture set cannot do the job, so new things are created. These actions may not be refined enough, but it can be seen as the prototype of the eighth piece.

In fact, Peking Opera, as well as any art form, cannot be very rich when it is first born. It must be gradually achieved through the accumulation of countless artists' efforts. According to legend, the tune of "Gui Fei Zui Jiu" was created by Mr. Mei Yutian, the ancestor of Mr. Mei Lanfang. The "Fan Xipi" singing style was created by Mr. Tan Xinpei, the ancestor of Mr. Tan Fuying. Today, these have become part of the original seven pieces. In those days, wouldn't they also appear in the form of the eighth piece? Examples like this are too numerous to mention.

The creation of this eighth piece must first rely on artists, especially old artists. Because if you are not familiar with the original seven pieces, it is difficult for the eighth piece to fall from the sky. However, the scope of this eighth piece is very broad, and all experts in drama, music, dance, fine arts, and lighting must lend a hand. But there is one prerequisite: you must be familiar with the original seven pieces.

Where should this eighth piece start? Where is the starting point for creating it? From the examples above, it can be seen that new things are created because the original ones are not enough. The saving of people in the water in "Luo Shengjiao" has been mentioned above. The tune of "Gui Fei Zui Jiu" was obviously created to express the mood of palace life. This play originally has no dramatic plot, but the poetry of the whole play is very strong. If these tunes were all replaced with the "Xiao Kai Men" and "Liu Yao Jin" that are common in Peking Opera, I am afraid that it would not be passed down to this day. From this, it can be inferred that the starting point for creating the eighth piece should be the script. Having a new script is equivalent to putting forward new requirements for the existing Peking Opera. In order to meet this requirement, new things will naturally be produced.

Speaking of this, it touches on the question of whether Peking Opera can express modern life. There are many people who say that Peking Opera cannot express modern life. Many people say that it is "frozen" and "rigid." We can look at this issue by reviewing the Ping Opera. In addition to singing, the costumes, props, and percussion of Ping Opera are mostly the same as those of Peking Opera. I have seen Ping Opera's "Hong Luan Xi." If you block your ears, it is difficult to distinguish how much difference there is from Peking Opera. And there are many small plays in Peking Opera, such as "Xiao Fang Niu," "Da Mian Gang," "Xiao Shang Fen," "Tan Qin Jia," "Da Ying Tao," and so on. Taking the ones mentioned here as an example, each one has its unique tune. Plays such as "Da Cheng Huang" and "Shuang Bei Deng" do not even have a single song. Using these (of course, not in their original form) to perform "Xiao Nv Xu" and "Liu Qiao Er," at the very least, it would have its own merits compared to Ping Opera, right?

The small plays mentioned above are only the plays of the three smalls (Xiao Sheng, Xiao Dan, Xiao Chou), but they are only a part of Peking Opera, and a small part. What about the rest of the large part? There is a "bridge" problem here. This "bridge" was broken in the Qing Dynasty. "Peng Gong An" and "Shi Gong An" were originally contemporary stories of the Qing Dynasty, but they wore Ming Dynasty costumes. Although there were also Qing Dynasty costume dramas such as "Huan Hai Chao" and "Ma Si Yuan," the number was originally small, and later they almost disappeared. Plays of the Republic of China era, such as "Qiang Bi Yan Ruisheng," although it caused a sensation in Shanghai, also died out quickly. The civilized dramas of Zhang Xiaoying and others were not the mainstream, so they could not last long. In fact, modern history such as "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," "Wuxu Coup," and "Hongxian Pseudo-Dynasty" are all excellent subjects for Peking Opera scripts. If this "bridge" can be built, the appearance of suits, Zhongshan suits, cheongsams, and even cadre uniforms on the Peking Opera stage will no longer feel abrupt. And in the process of building this "bridge," Peking Opera itself will inevitably grow stronger. As a Peking Opera audience, I sincerely hope that comrades with the ability in this area will bring out more things.
