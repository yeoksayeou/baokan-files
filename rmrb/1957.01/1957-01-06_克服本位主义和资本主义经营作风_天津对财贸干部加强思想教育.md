Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin: Xinhua News Agency reporter Huang Jun reports: The Finance and Trade Work Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to raise the policy and ideological level of cadres in the finance and trade departments and overcome departmentalism and capitalist business practices, carried out an ideological review of financial and economic policies throughout the city's finance and trade system from September to December 1956. During the review process, all units fully promoted democracy and mobilized the masses. Leading cadres of the department stores, knitwear, and cultural procurement and supply stations personally visited factories with which they had close relationships to actively solicit opinions. The Vegetable, Food, and Grocery Company, the Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company, and other units invited representatives from agricultural and fishery production cooperatives, neighborhood committees, and small vendors to attend forums to hear their opinions on the commercial departments. Over 10,000 problems of various kinds were uncovered during the review, and these problems were carefully checked, analyzed, and studied. The policy and ideological levels of many cadres have now been raised, and work has begun to improve.

The Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Hardware and Machinery Company used to consider its own interests more when arranging production, implementing production and sales contracts, and controlling prices, while paying less attention to the difficulties of the other party, resulting in tense relations between industry and commerce. After this review and study, many cadres frequently go deep into the factories and consult with them on matters. In November 1956, one hundred tons of No. 10 iron wire produced by the Tianjin Iron Wire Factory had inconsistent colors. In the past, this would have resulted in rejection, but this time the inspector took the initiative to invite the factory's inspector to jointly analyze and study the situation on-site. They found that the problem was caused by inaccurate temperature control during galvanizing, which affected the appearance but did not affect the quality. Therefore, the purchasing station accepted the goods as usual, and the factory recorded the situation for future improvement. In October 1956, the Tianjin XinSheng Horse Steel Factory suspended work due to a shortage of materials. This station took the initiative to collect 127 tons of waste oil drums, iron sheet scraps, and other materials to support production, enabling the factory not only to complete its original plan for the fourth quarter but also to increase its production of cotter pins by 49,000 dozens. In terms of price control, the Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of the Hardware and Machinery Company also changed its past practice of focusing solely on its own profits. In September 1956, the Tianjin Wire Drawing and Nail Making Factory trial-produced shoe nails, and the cost was twice the normal cost of Qingdao products. Under this circumstance, the Tianjin Wire Drawing and Nail Making Factory proposed not to make any profit and requested that the purchasing and supply station be able to accept the goods. However, this station considered that its commercial profit from operating shoe nails was already too high, and in order to encourage the factory to produce new products, it ultimately gave up about half of its commercial profit to the factory.

Commercial departments dealing in vegetables and aquatic products have also begun to see significant improvements in their relations with farmers and fishermen. The Tianjin Municipal Company of the China Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company used to exercise excessive control over fishermen in terms of price control and market management, resulting in a phenomenon of competing with fishermen for profits. When fishermen sold fast-selling goods such as dried shrimp, peeled shrimp, and clam meat, the company would purchase them and resell them to retail units, earning a profit of 6% to 25%. This practice has now been changed, with retail units directly purchasing goods from fishermen, increasing fishermen's income. On December 16, 1956, fishermen from Nanbu Town, Hebei Province, transported more than 110,000 kilograms of peeled shrimp, earning over 7,000 yuan more. Due to the improvement of relations with fishermen, the daily supply of fish in Tianjin has increased from 400 to 500 kilograms to 2,000 to 3,000 kilograms, and the market is becoming increasingly active.

The relationship between retail stores and consumers has also greatly improved, with many large state-owned and joint state-private stores simplifying procedures to facilitate customers. Some small joint venture stores have begun to correct capitalist business practices such as short measures, inferior goods, and adulteration, which existed in the past. The Vegetable, Food, and Grocery Company has also abolished the inappropriate unified management of vegetables and changed to allowing retail stores to directly purchase goods from the market, thereby reducing five or six links and allowing citizens to eat fresh vegetables of the day.

The person in charge of the Finance and Trade Work Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China said that in order to strengthen the political work of the finance and trade departments, the review of policies and ideologies and business practices will be carried out as a regular task, generally once every six months, in order to specifically solve the problems existing in the implementation of policies by cadres.

### 克服本位主义和资本主义经营作风  天津对财贸干部加强思想教育

    克服本位主义和资本主义经营作风
    天津对财贸干部加强思想教育
    新华社天津电　新华社记者黄军报道：中共天津市委财政贸易工作部为了提高财政贸易部门干部的政策思想水平，克服本位主义和资本主义经营作风，从1956年9月份，到12月在全市财政贸易系统开展了有关财经政策的思想检查工作。检查过程中，各单位充分发扬了民主，发动了群众。百货、针织、文化等采购供应站的领导干部都亲自到和他们关系密切的工厂去访问，主动征求意见；蔬菜食品杂货公司、水产供销公司等单位邀请农业和渔业生产合作社、居民委员会及小商小贩的代表开座谈会听取他们对商业部门的意见。经过检查揭发出了一万多件各种各样的问题，对这些问题都进行了认真的查对与分析研究。现在许多干部的政策思想水平已经有所提高，工作也开始有了改进。
    中国五金机械公司天津采购供应站过去在安排生产、执行产销合同以及掌握价格等方面，考虑自己的利益多，照顾对方的困难少，工商之间的关系很紧张。经过这次检查学习后，许多干部经常深入工厂，遇事和工厂协商。1956年11月间，天津铁丝厂生产的一百吨十号铁丝，色泽不一致，如果过去遇有这种情况就拒收了事，但是这次验货员主动邀请工厂检验员共同深入现场分析研究，结果发现原来是在挂锌时火候不准，虽然有碍美观，但并不影响质量，因此，采购站照常接收了这批货，厂方也将研究情况记录下来作为今后改进的依据。1956年10月间，天津新生马钢厂停工待料，这个站就主动搜集废油筒、铁板边等一百二十七吨材料支援生产，使这个工厂不但完成了第四季度原订计划，还增产了插肖四万九千打。在掌握价格方面，五金机械公司天津采购供应站也改变了光从本身利润着眼的偏向，天津拔丝制钉厂在9月间试制鞋钉，成本高于青岛产品正常成本的两倍，在此情况下，天津拔丝制钉厂提出不要利润要求这个采购供应站能够收货，但是这个站考虑到自己经营鞋钉的商业利润本来过高，为了鼓励工厂生产新产品，最后仍将商业利润的大约一半让给了工厂。
    经营蔬菜和水产品的商业部门，在对待农民和渔民的关系上也开始有了显著的改善。中国水产供销公司天津市公司过去在掌握价格、市场管理等方面对渔民都抓得过死，存在着同渔民争利的现象。渔民出售海米、皮米、蚶米等畅销货时，这个公司就在统一收购后再转售给零售单位，从中获得6％到25％的利润。现在改变了这种作法，由零售单位向渔民直接进货，使渔民收入增加，1956年12月16日河北省南堡镇渔民运来皮米十一万多斤，因此就多卖了七千多元。由于对渔民关系的改善，现在天津市的鱼货上市量已由每天四、五百斤增加到二、三千斤，市场日益活跃。
    零售商店与消费者的关系也大为改善，许多大的国营和公私合营商店都在简化手续，便利顾客。一些小的合营商店过去有短尺缺秤、以次顶好、掺假使杂等资本主义经营作风的现在也都开始在纠正。蔬菜食品杂货公司还取消了不适当的统一经营蔬菜的办法，改由零售店直接向市场进货，因此减少了五、六道环节，使市民可以吃到当天的新鲜蔬菜。
    中共天津市委员会财政贸易工作部负责人说，为了加强财政贸易部门的政治工作，今后要把政策思想和经营作风的检查作为定期的工作，一般半年进行一次，以便具体地解决干部在执行政策上存在的问题。
