    Rescue Old Wooden Crates from the Fire
    This year I purchased a batch of goods in Shanghai that required wooden crate packaging, but I couldn't buy any after searching the entire city. It is said that this is mainly due to a lack of raw materials.
    However, in our company, many brand-new wooden crates are discarded in the open air, exposed to wind and rain, and rot and mold, with no one caring about them. In the end, they are simply burned as kindling. In other commercial departments, such large-scale waste of wooden crates can be found everywhere.
    I suggest that relevant departments establish old wooden crate recycling stations to utilize the recycled wooden crates, save timber for the country, and reduce the packaging costs of goods.

    把旧木箱从火堆里救出来
    今年我在上海购买了一批货物，需要木箱包装，但跑遍了全市也没买到，据说主要是缺乏原料。
    但是，在我们公司里，许多崭新的木箱却被扔在露天地里，被风吹雨打，腐朽霉烂，无人过问。最后干脆当作引火柴烧毁了。其它商业部门，像这样大量糟蹋木箱的，到处可以找到。
    我建议有关部门设立旧木箱收购站，将回收的木箱加以利用，为国家节约木材，降低商品的包装费用。北京五金公司　席连周
