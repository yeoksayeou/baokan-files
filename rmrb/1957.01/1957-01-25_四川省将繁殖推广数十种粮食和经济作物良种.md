Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 23rd. Dozens of excellent grain and cash crop seeds have attracted the attention and praise of visitors at the Sichuan Provincial Agricultural Exhibition, which opened on January 20th.

These fine varieties were discovered by the Sichuan Provincial Agricultural Department last year from agricultural cooperatives, state-owned farms, and agricultural experiment stations throughout the province. Most of them are fine rice varieties. For example, the late rice variety "Ka Er Gu" from Pi County has a short growth period and is very suitable for the needs of planting double-cropping rice in the cooler western Sichuan Plain. The mid-season rice variety "Xiao Ma Gu" from Xinfan County has the characteristics of drought resistance and cold resistance. It is suitable for planting in hilly and semi-mountainous areas with poor water conservancy conditions and barren land. The average yield per mu is more than 600 jin, which is more than 20% higher than that of ordinary mid-season rice. In addition, the rice varieties "Qing Gan Gu Er" from Shuangliu County and "He Gu" from Gusong County all have the advantages of high and stable yield, adaptability, and resistance to diseases and lodging.

In terms of sweet potatoes, the yield per mu of the fine variety "Hunan Shu" from Wan County reached more than 2,000 jin in the semi-alpine region.

In terms of cash crops, the "Da Huang Rapeseed" from Shehong County and the "Zao Huang Rapeseed" from Xinfan County are very suitable for farmers' requirements to increase the planting of one crop between the spring and winter crops, and can largely solve the contradiction of delaying the season due to increased planting.

The Sichuan Provincial Agricultural Department has decided to propagate, test, and promote the above-mentioned fine varieties in areas with suitable conditions this year.

    四川省将繁殖推广数十种粮食和经济作物良种
    新华社成都23日电　在1月20日开幕的四川省农业展览会上，数十种优良的粮食和经济作物种子，受到了观众的注意和赞扬。
    这些良种是四川省农业部门在去年从全省各地农业社、国营农场和农业试验站里发掘出来的，大多数是水稻的良种。例如，郫县的晚稻良种“卡耳谷”，生长期短，很适于气温较低的川西平原种植双季稻的需要；新繁县的中熟稻良种“小麻谷”，具有耐旱、耐寒等特点，适宜水利条件不大好和瘠薄的丘陵地和半山地种植，每亩平均产量有六百多斤，比一般中熟稻高两成以上。此外，双流县的“青秆谷儿”、古宋县的“河谷”等水稻良种，都具有产量高、稳定、不择地和抗病、抗倒伏等优点。
    在红薯方面，万县的良种“湖南苕”，在半高山地区的每亩产量达到了二千斤以上。
    在经济作物方面，射洪县的“大黄油菜”和新繁县的“早黄油菜”，很适于农民在大春和小春作物之间增种一季作物的要求，在很大程度上可以解决因增种而误季的矛盾。
    上述良种，四川省农业部门已决定在今年分别在有条件的地区加以繁殖、试验推广。
