Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 18th: The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party, newly elected at the Eighth National Congress, held its first plenary session in Rome from January 14th to 16th.

Comrades Arturo Colombi, a member of the Party's leadership, and Giorgio Amendola, Secretary of the Secretariat, delivered reports on rural issues and party organizational work, respectively. The plenary session discussed the two reports and adopted corresponding resolutions. In addition, the plenary session also appointed the leaders of the standing committees of the Central Committee and the editors of party journals, and approved the final draft of the resolutions passed by the Eighth Party Congress.

In his report entitled "The Situation in Agriculture and the Struggle Against Poverty," Colombi pointed out that the current characteristic of the rural situation in Italy is the deterioration of living conditions for the vast majority of farmers. He said that nearly half of Italian farmers have no land, or the land is so small that it cannot support their families. At present, there are 2.5 million landless hired farm laborers and 1.7 million small farmers with little land in the country, who are constantly threatened with complete bankruptcy. He emphasized that this part of the peasantry can and should become an ally of the working class in the struggle for socialism.

Colombi concluded by talking about the tasks of the Italian Communist Party in striving to improve the living conditions of the peasant masses. He announced that the Italian Communist Party is prepared to convene a national conference on land reform in the near future.

In his report, Amendola emphasized the need to mobilize the entire party to implement the resolutions of the Eighth National Congress.

When talking about the work of renewing party membership cards, Amendola said that renewing party membership cards will demonstrate the strength of the party. So far, the number of party members has consistently remained above two million, and the number of people joining the party every year is between 100,000 and 200,000. In 1957, despite the pressure exerted by the enemy, the prospects are still good.

    意共中央举行全会
    讨论农村问题及党的组织工作
    新华社18日讯　罗马消息：意大利共产党第八次全国代表大会上新选出的中央委员会在1月14日到16日在罗马举行了第一次全体会议。
    党的指导部委员阿尔图罗·科隆比和书记处书记乔治·阿门多拉在会上分别就农村问题和党的组织工作作了报告。全会讨论了这两个报告并且通过了相应的决议。此外，全会还任命了中央委员会各常设委员会的领导人和党机关刊物的编辑，批准了第八次党代表大会所通过的决议的最后定稿。
    科隆比在题为“农业方面的情况和为反对贫困而斗争”的报告中指出：目前意大利农村情况的特点是绝大多数农民生活条件恶化。他说，差不多有半数的意大利农民没有土地，或者是土地少得不能养家。现在，国内有二百五十万户无地的雇农，还有一百七十万户土地不多的小农，这些小农经常遭到完全破产的威胁。他强调指出：这部分农民可以而且应当成为工人阶级在争取社会主义的斗争中的盟友。
    科隆比最后谈到了意大利共产党在争取改善农民群众生活条件方面的任务。他宣布，意大利共产党准备在最近召开讨论土地改革问题的全国代表会议。
    阿门多拉在报告中强调必须动员全党来实现第八次全国代表大会的决议。
    阿门多拉在谈到换发党证的工作时说：换发党证将显示党的力量。到目前为止，党员人数始终保持在两百万人以上，每年入党的人有十万到二十万人之多。1957年，尽管敌人施行压力，前景仍然是良好的。
