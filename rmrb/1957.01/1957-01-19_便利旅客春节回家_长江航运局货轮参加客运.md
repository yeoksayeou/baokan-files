    新华社武汉18日电　长江航运管理局决定在春节前后抽调一些货轮参加客运，同时采取合理调整各航线船只、调整原有客轮铺位、客货轮开大舱载客等办法，以保证全线船只的客位比平时增加57％。
    按照运力安排，上海到苏北线从1月23日到26日将先后增加三艘货轮载客，客位将从现在的每天平均九千二百多个增加到一万三千六百多个。汉口到上海线从1月14日起已经增加了“民众”、“江明”两艘大客轮，平均每天载客量从平时的六百多人增加到一千四百多人。在汉口以上的航线上，从1月20日起将增加两艘货轮和三只客驳载客，每天平均载客量将增加50％左右。
    长江全线职工现在正在忙于准备春节客运。准备载客的货轮，船员们正在安装照明设备，增加卫生设施；多数港口的职工已经为旅客新购置和修补了上下船处的客梯、跳板、栏干、安全网等安全设备。
