Xinhua News Agency, January 1st: Xie Juezai, Minister of Internal Affairs of the People's Republic of China, delivered a broadcast speech on the Central People's Broadcasting Station on New Year's Eve to all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and to the families of martyrs, families of soldiers, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers throughout the country, congratulating them on the New Year of 1957. Xie Juezai said: Comrades, officers, and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army! The Party, the government, and the people of the whole country clearly know that any achievement made in the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland is inseparable from your immortal contributions. The people of the motherland love you, support you, support you, and place extremely high hopes on you. Although the current international situation is gradually easing, the imperialists are unwilling to let the people of the world live in peace, let alone let us carry out socialist construction. I hope that you will continue to be vigilant, strengthen modern military training, and strictly prevent any provocations by the imperialists. At the same time, I also hope that you will maintain close contact with your relatives at home and your comrades who have been demobilized and transferred to production and construction posts, communicate frequently, encourage each other, and encourage them to engage in labor production and work hard; especially for relatives and comrades on the agricultural production front, you should encourage them to settle down in agricultural production and actively build their hometowns.

    Xie Juezai said: Comrades, families of martyrs, families of soldiers, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers! The Party, the government, and the people of the whole country also know that all the achievements of the motherland are condensed with the blood and sweat of your relatives and yourselves. You have not only contributed to the country and the people in previous revolutionary wars and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, but also made remarkable achievements together with the people of the whole country in various production and work posts. You are indeed a strong and active force in my country's socialist construction. Now, our people across the country are actively responding to the call of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and enthusiastically participating in the socialist construction of the motherland. You all have considerable political awareness and are full of high enthusiasm for building the motherland. Therefore, the Party and the government attach special importance to and care for you. I hope you will "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory" and make greater contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland.
    Xie Juezai said: The Second Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee emphasized that all cadres and people in the country must practice increasing production and practicing economy, advocate the style of hard work and thrift, and resolutely oppose any extravagance and waste. Our comrades, families of martyrs, families of soldiers, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers all have the fine tradition of hard work and courage to overcome difficulties. We should carry forward this tradition and become models in responding to the Party's great call. We hope that you will be content with your work posts, do not care about status and treatment, and no matter what production or work post you are in, you must do your best and enjoy the fruits you should enjoy, and do not force the government and the people to meet requirements that cannot be met now. Xie Juezai said, I would like to say a few words especially to the demobilized soldiers in rural areas. As everyone knows, to build our country into a prosperous and strong socialist country, it is necessary for the people of the whole country to work together in all aspects. Socialism not only needs a strong industry, but also a strong agriculture. Industry and agriculture are interdependent. Most comrades understand this principle. You are content with agricultural production and have made remarkable achievements, becoming backbone members of the masses. However, a few comrades still have the phenomenon of not being content with agricultural production. Some of them do not see the prospects for agricultural production, and some of them shake their confidence when they encounter some difficulties in production. Of course, these are all wrong.
    Comrades, we also know that among our families of martyrs, families of soldiers, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers, there are indeed some comrades who have some difficulties in production and life that are difficult to overcome. The Party, the government, and the people have the responsibility to help you overcome these difficulties. In the past year, the Party, the government, and the people have made great efforts in preferential treatment and resettlement work and have achieved certain results. In terms of preferential treatment, with the realization of agricultural cooperation, various places have promoted the method of preferential workdays. For isolated, elderly, sick, and weak families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled soldiers who still cannot maintain their lives after implementing preferential workdays, the government also provides financial assistance to ensure that their lives can reach the level of ordinary commune members in the local area. In terms of resettlement of demobilized soldiers, the vast majority of demobilized soldiers have been properly resettled, and the difficulties they have in production and life have also been appropriately resolved. However, it is undeniable that there are still many shortcomings in our work, and some shortcomings are even very serious. For example, many places have not yet implemented the method of preferential workdays, and even in places where it has been implemented, there are still unreasonable phenomena such as assessing too few preferential workdays for families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled soldiers, and deducting too many workdays they do themselves. In the resettlement of demobilized soldiers, some problems such as insufficient labor, disease treatment, and marital disputes have not been well resolved. There are also many problems in the assessment of ranks and wage treatment for demobilized soldiers working in factories, mines, enterprises, and institutions. The existence of these problems has seriously affected the production and life of these comrades. Some things that should not have happened have even occurred. We must correct these things. Around the Spring Festival in 1957, a large-scale movement to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers will be launched throughout the country. Through this movement, the people and cadres of the whole country will be educated to strengthen the concept of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, thoroughly inspect the work of preferential treatment and resettlement, discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner, in order to lay a solid foundation for further strengthening this work.

    向解放军、志愿军、烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人的元旦广播词（摘要）
    新华社1日讯　中华人民共和国内务部部长谢觉哉元旦晚上在中央人民广播电台向中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军的全体官兵，全国的烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人发表广播讲话，祝贺1957年新年。谢觉哉说：中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军的官兵同志们！党、政府和全国人民清楚地知道，祖国社会主义革命和社会主义建设所取得的任何成就，都是和你们的不朽功勋分不开的。祖国人民热爱你们，拥护你们，支援你们，对你们寄予极高的希望。当前的国际形势虽然日趋缓和，但是，帝国主义是不甘愿世界人民过和平生活、更不甘愿我们进行社会主义建设的。希望你们继续提高警惕，加强现代化的军事训练，严防帝国主义的任何挑衅。同时，还希望你们同在家的亲人和复员、转业到生产建设岗位上的战友保持密切的联系，经常通信，相互勉励，鼓励他们好好地从事劳动生产，好好工作；特别是对在农业生产战线上的亲人和战友，更要鼓励他们安心农业生产，积极地建设自己的家乡。
    谢觉哉说：烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人同志们！党、政府和全国人民同样地知道，祖国的一切成就，也都凝结着你们的亲人和你们自己的血和汗。你们不仅过去在历次革命战争和抗美援朝战争中，都有功于国家，有功于人民，而且在各种生产和工作岗位上，又同全国人民一道，做出了显著的成绩。你们确实是我国社会主义建设中的一支强大的积极力量。现在，我们全国人民，正在积极地响应中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的号召，热烈地参加祖国的社会主义建设。你们都具有相当的政治觉悟，都富有建设祖国的高度热情，因此，党和政府对你们特别重视和关怀，希望你们“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，在祖国的社会主义建设事业中，能作出更大的贡献。
    谢觉哉说：党的二中全会强调指出，全国所有的干部和人民，必须厉行增产节约，提倡艰苦朴素的作风，坚决地反对任何铺张浪费的行为。我们烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人同志都有艰苦奋斗和勇于克服困难的优良传统，我们应当发扬这种传统，成为响应党的这个伟大号召的模范。我们希望你们安心自己的工作岗位，不要计较地位和待遇，不管是在什么生产或工作岗位上，都要尽自己能尽的力量，享受自己应该享受的果实，不要强求政府和人民满足现在还不可能满足的要求。谢觉哉说，我愿意特别向农村的复员军人同志们说几句话。大家知道，要把我国建设成为一个繁荣、富强的社会主义国家，必须要全国人民从各方面共同努力，社会主义不只需要有强大的工业，也需要有强大的农业，工业、农业是相互依靠的。这个道理，多数同志是了解的，你们安心于农业生产，并且已经取得了显著的成绩，成为群众中的骨干分子。但是，也有少数同志还存在着不安心于农业生产的现象。他们有的看不到农业生产的前途，有的在生产中遇到了一些困难就动摇了自己的信心。这当然都是不应该的。
    同志们，我们也知道，在我们烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人之中，确实也有一些同志在生产、生活等方面存在着一些自己难于克服的困难，党、政府和人民群众有责任帮助你们克服这些困难。过去的一年，党、政府和人民群众对优抚、复员安置工作做了很大的努力，取得了一定的成绩。在优抚工作方面，随着农业合作化的实现，各地推行了优待劳动日的办法，对实行优待劳动日后仍不能维持生活的孤、老、病、弱烈属、军属和残废军人，政府还给以财力补助，保证他们的生活能达到当地一般社员的水平。在复员安置工作方面，绝大多数复员军人都得到了妥善安置，他们在生产、生活中存在的困难问题，也大都得到了适当的解决。但是，也不可否认，我们工作中还存在着许多缺点，有些缺点甚至是非常严重的。比如，不少地方到现在还没有实行优待劳动日的办法，就是已经实行了的地方，也还有给烈属、军属、残废军人评定优待劳动日过少，扣除他们自做劳动日过多等不合理的现象。在复员安置工作中，有些复员军人同志所存在的劳力不足、疾病治疗、婚姻纠纷等问题，也没有很好的解决。在工厂、矿山、企业、机关中工作的复员军人，评定级别、工资待遇等方面也有不少问题。由于这些问题的存在，严重地影响了这些同志的生产和生活。甚至发生了一些极不应该发生的事情。对于这些，我们一定要加以纠正。1957年春节前后，将要在全国开展一次规模壮阔的拥军优属运动。通过这个运动，教育全国人民和干部，加强拥军优属的观念，彻底检查优抚和复员安置工作，发现问题，及时解决，以求给进一步加强这一工作打下稳固的基础。
