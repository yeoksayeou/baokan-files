    Has the Open Free Market "Screwed Up"?
    Chen Ji
    After the Xiaogan Special District of Hubei Province opened the free market in the third quarter of last year, the rural market became more active than before. Some previously unsalable local products have opened up sales channels. In the past, it was difficult to buy piglets in the market; since the opening of the free market, agricultural cooperatives throughout the district have purchased more than 30,000 piglets. The variety of goods on the market is greater than before. State-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives are also working hard to improve their own management.
    However, some cadres, seeing phenomena such as farmers blindly engaging in commerce, black markets for certain commodities, and some units vying to purchase materials in the market, believe that the "free market has been screwed up," that "opening it up is not allowed," and even suspect whether the policy of relaxing market controls is correct. They not only "see the trees but not the forest," but also only see the worm-eaten trees and not the healthy growing trees. They underestimate the achievements of relaxing market controls, one-sidedly exaggerate the shortcomings, and do not carefully analyze the reasons for these shortcomings.
    Activating the rural market is an important link in activating the urban and rural economy. To activate the rural market, work must be carried out in accordance with the nature and characteristics of the rural market. The rural market is basically a farmer's market. Because in this market, the objects of purchase and sale are mainly farmers, followed by handicraft producers, small traders, and peddlers. Organized farmers and handicraftsmen are small producers who have only recently shaken off private ownership. In addition to accepting the state's planned leadership in major commodities, they hope to conduct some free trade. Opening up the free market has already had the effect of increasing the production enthusiasm of farmers and handicraftsmen. At the same time, there are many kinds of agricultural and sideline products, the production and sales situation is complex, and the changes are great. It is impossible to rely solely on the state's plan for production and distribution, and it is necessary to use the free market to solve certain contradictions existing between production and consumption. In fact, quite a few effects have already been achieved in this regard.
    It cannot be denied that there are still some problems in the current rural market. These problems are precisely the result of the relevant leading departments not strengthening their leadership over the free market. Some state-owned commercial departments, institutions, and organizations rush to purchase materials in the free market, which also contributes to the chaos in the free market. There is no need to doubt the policy of opening up the free market; what is urgently needed now is to learn how to open up the free market and how to strengthen leadership over the free market using administrative and economic methods.
    Establishing farmers' trade service stations and trading houses is one of the important methods of managing the free market. Doing so can prevent some units from rushing to purchase materials in the market; can better grasp the prices in the market, so that the commodities traded by farmers will not experience drastic price increases or decreases, and maintain relatively fair and reasonable prices; and also greatly facilitate farmers to conduct trade and reduce the intermediate links in commodity circulation.

### 开放自由市场“搞糟了”吗？

    开放自由市场“搞糟了”吗？
    陈迹
    湖北孝感专区在去年第三季开放自由市场以后，农村市场比过去活跃了。原来滞销的一些土特产，已经打开了销路。过去在市场上很难买到小猪；从开放自由市场到现在，全区农业社已经购进三万多头小猪。市场上的商品品种比过去多了。国营商业和供销合作社也在努力改进自己的经营管理工作。
    可是，有些干部看到市场上出现了一些农民盲目经营商业、某些商品有黑市、有些单位争购物资等现象，就认为“自由市场搞糟了”，“开放不得”，甚至怀疑放宽市场管理的方针是否正确。他们不但“只见树木，不见森林”，而且只见虫蛀了的树木，不见健壮地生长着的树木。他们对放宽市场管理的成绩估计不足，片面地夸大了缺点，而且没有仔细分析产生这些缺点的原因。
    活跃农村市场是活跃城乡经济的重要一环。要活跃农村市场，必须按照农村市场的性质和特点进行工作。农村市场，基本上就是农民市场。因为在这种市场上，购销的对象主要是农民，其次是手工业生产者、小商小贩等。组织起来的农民和手工业者，是摆脱私有制不久的小生产者，他们除在主要商品方面能接受国家的计划领导外，是希望进行一些自由贸易的。开放自由市场，已经收到了提高农民和手工业者的生产积极性的效果。同时，农副产品种类繁多，产销情况复杂，变化大，单纯依靠国家的计划进行生产和分配是做不到的，需要利用自由市场来解决生产和消费间存在的某些矛盾。在这方面，事实上也已经收到了不少效果。
    不能否认，目前农村市场上还存在着若干问题。这些问题，正是有关领导部门没有加强对自由市场的领导的结果。有些国营商业部门、机关、团体等到自由市场上乱抢购物资，也助长了自由市场的混乱。怀疑开放自由市场的方针是没有必要的；目前迫切需要的是学会究竟应该怎样开放自由市场，怎样运用行政和经济的方法加强对自由市场的领导。
    设立农民贸易服务所、行栈等，是管理自由市场的重要方法之一。这样做，可以防止有些单位在市场上乱抢购物资；可以更好地掌握市场上的价格，使农民贸易的商品不会有暴涨暴落的情况，保持比较公平合理的价格；同时也大大便利农民进行贸易，减少商品流转的中间环节。
