The Story of White Cloth Scraps
Deng Baizhou

At breakfast time, a large group of people was gathered under the wall in front of the senior cooperative office, crowding to look at a newly posted list. Some were craning their necks, some were standing on tiptoes, some were laughing, and some were shouting. It was several times more lively than watching a play.

Mother-in-law Li was frying shredded radishes in front of the stove when she heard the commotion outside and went to the gate to take a look. As soon as she saw the scene, she couldn't help but walk forward.

It turned out to be a literacy list from the cooperative. Who was illiterate, how many characters they knew, and when they would no longer be considered illiterate were all clearly written on the list.

Mother-in-law Li was over sixty years old, and her eyesight wasn't good. Besides seeing the three large characters "Literacy List" at the top of the list, she could only see a series of blurry black dots. She asked the production team leader, Shi Sheng, who was standing next to her, "What does it say about me?" Before Shi Sheng could find her name, little devil Sanxi blurted out, "You? Fifty characters!"

Mother-in-law Li ignored Sanxi and seriously asked Shi Sheng, "Sanxi is always joking. Shi Sheng, take a look for me."

Shi Sheng looked carefully for a while before reading it to her word by word, and it was exactly what little devil Sanxi had said. Mother-in-law Li was silent for a moment, then asked Shi Sheng, "What about my daughter-in-law, Cuiying?" As soon as Sanxi heard this, he blurted out again, "Her? She knows much more than you!" He held out three fingers and shook them, saying, "Three hundred, several times more than you!"

Mother-in-law Li would have been fine if she hadn't heard this, but as soon as she did, her face changed. The wrinkles around her eyes seemed deeper and coarser, and her face was stern as she asked Shi Sheng, "Who wrote this list? Are they just scribbling nonsense in the room?" Shi Sheng smiled and replied, "Of course not! This was written by the literacy school teacher based on the cooperative's assessment. It can't be wrong!"

"Can't be wrong, huh! Please give them a message to come to my house." Mother-in-law Li said, pursed her lips, and turned away.

Mother-in-law Li walked into the kitchen, where her daughter-in-law, Cuiying, was clumsily trying to stir the shredded radishes in the pot with chopsticks. When Mother-in-law Li came out, she had only intended to take a quick look and go back in, so she had even taken the spatula with her. Cuiying had returned from the fields, and as soon as she entered the house, she smelled the burnt smell of radish shreds in the kitchen. She rushed into the kitchen to see, but didn't see her mother-in-law, and after searching for a long time, she couldn't find the spatula, so she panicked and had to use chopsticks as a spatula.

When Mother-in-law Li saw Cuiying's awkwardness, she didn't give her the spatula but instead asked urgently, "Did you participate in the last literacy assessment in the cooperative?" (Because Cuiying was the women's group leader) Cuiying looked up and saw her mother-in-law's expression, and she exclaimed in surprise, "Oh! Mother, the radish shreds are burning, why are you asking about literacy assessments? What's so important about that?"

Mother-in-law Li was angry and threw the spatula on the stove, saying, "I don't care if it's important or not, I just want to know who said I only know fifty characters?"

When Cuiying heard this, she started cleaning up the stove while laughing, "Oh! So that's what it's about. Last time at the cooperative meeting, everyone asked how many characters you knew, and I couldn't say for sure. Later, the cooperative director remembered that you had attended literacy school for a few nights, so you must know at least fifty characters. That's what the literacy school teacher wrote on the list. What's your problem with that?"

Mother-in-law Li's expression seemed to soften a little, but she still pressed further, "Who assessed your three hundred characters?" Cuiying said, "I counted them myself, one by one." Mother-in-law Li said, "Alright! You know how to count, count them for me after we eat."

After eating, Mother-in-law Li took out a not-so-thick small grid notebook from the house and tossed it to Cuiying, saying, "You count them!" Cuiying opened it and saw that it was densely filled with many characters. Some were things of daily use, such as "clothes," "bowls and chopsticks"; some were agricultural tools, such as "plow," "threshing machine"; some were body parts, such as "hands and feet," and so on. The characters were written so neatly and elegantly. Cuiying counted them, and there were as many as four hundred.

Cuiying couldn't believe that Mother-in-law Li had written them, nor could she believe that she could recognize them. She wanted to test her, so she randomly pointed to a few characters that she knew and asked her. Mother-in-law Li answered without any mistake—the pronunciation was correct, and the meaning was clear. This made Cuiying feel both embarrassed and confused. She had never seen her mother-in-law holding a book to read, nor had she seen her sitting at a table to write. What clever method did she use to master so many characters? She had to slowly ask her mother-in-law, and Mother-in-law Li couldn't help but laugh, telling her the story of her learning in detail.

"Last winter, the literacy school moved so far away, and I couldn't see the road clearly at night. What could I do to go to school? If I didn't study, everyone in the family would be able to read and see newspapers in the future, and I would be the only 'blind person' left. I wasn't willing to accept that. So I made up my mind to study on my own and compete with you. I asked someone to buy a pound of white cloth scraps and cut them into small squares. Every day, I went outside to ask people about one or two characters and asked them to write them on the small cloth pieces. After they wrote them for me, I would stick the small cloth pieces on the objects. For example, for the character 'clothes,' I would nail it on the clothes; for the character 'quilt,' I would nail it on the quilt; for the character 'hand,' I would stick it on my arm; for the character 'bowl,' I would stick it under the bowl. In this way, the characters followed the objects, and the objects followed the people, so I could practice the characters at any time. I practiced in the air with my fingers while walking; I practiced in the bowl with chopsticks while eating; I practiced on the water with a wooden pole while washing clothes; I practiced on my belly with my fingers while sleeping. After practicing again and again, I mastered the characters and then wrote them in the notebook. This way, not only did I remember the characters well, but I also wrote them well!..."

Cuiying listened quietly, gazing intently at her mother-in-law's expression, as if she were watching a stranger speak. And Mother-in-law Li's voice became louder and clearer as she spoke, and her expression became more energetic and vibrant. By the end, a young person's smile appeared on her face.

    白布屑的故事
    邓白洲
    吃早饭时候，高级社办公室前面的墙头下，围着一大群人，挤着看壁上新贴的一张榜。有的伸着脖子，有的颠起脚尖，有的在笑，有的在喊。真是比看把戏还热闹几倍。
    李四婆婆正在灶前炒着萝卜丝，听到外面的喧闹声，便赶到大门口张望。她一见这个场面，就脚不由己地往前走去。
    原来这是社里一张扫盲榜。谁是文盲，谁认识多少字，谁几时不算文盲，榜上都写得一清二楚。
    李四婆婆六十开外了，眼力不管用，除看清了榜的上端横排着“扫盲榜”三个大字外，以下的字就只看到一个个模糊的黑点点了。她就问站在旁边的生产队长石生道：“我呢，上面写些什么？”石生还没有找到她的名字，三喜小鬼就抢先叫道：“你吗？五十个字！”
    李四婆婆没理睬三喜，正正经经地又对石生说：“三喜小鬼专爱开玩笑，石生你给我看看。”
    石生仔细找了一会，才一字一字地念给她听，和三喜小鬼说的没差分毫。李四婆婆沉默了一下，又问石生道：“我媳妇翠英呢？”三喜一听又抢先说道：“她呀！那比你多多了。”他把手一伸，伸出三个指头摇晃着说：“三百个，比你多几倍哩！”
    李四婆婆不听这句话还好，一听脸色就不同了，眉角边的绉纹显得更多更粗，脸孔板得沉沉地问石生道：“这榜是谁写的？不是坐在房子里乱画符吧？”石生笑答道：“那还行！这是民校老师根据社里的摸底写的。错不了！”
    “错不了，哼！请你捎个口信，要他来我家打个转身。”四婆婆说完嘴巴一竖，扭转身就走了。
    四婆婆走进厨房，媳妇翠英正在横一下顺一下地用筷子往锅子里夹萝卜丝。原来李四婆婆出来时本只打算望一望就进去，所以连锅铲也拿出来了。翠英从地里回来，一进屋就闻到厨房里萝卜丝烧焦的气味，赶进厨房去看，没看到娘，找了半天又没找到锅铲，慌了手脚，就只好把筷子当锅铲用。
    李四婆婆看见翠英这个顽劲，也不把锅铲递给她，却声急气促的问道：“社里上次摸识字的底，你参加没有？”（因为翠英是妇女组长）翠英抬头见娘这副模样，有点骇怪似地喊道：“唉哟！娘呀，萝卜丝成了锅巴咧，还问什么识字摸底，这是件什么大事呐？”
    四婆婆生气了，把锅铲往灶上一甩，说道：“不管大不大，我只问谁说我只认识五十个字？”
    翠英一听，才一边收拾灶上的东西，一边笑道：“啊哟！原来这么一件事。上次社里开会，大家问你识多少字，我也说不出，后来还是社主任记性好，说你进过几夜民校，至少也认识五十个字了，民校老师就这样写上了榜。你有什么意见呐？”
    四婆婆脸色似乎缓和了一些，但还是进一步追问道：“你的三百个又是谁给摸的？”翠英道：“这是我自己一个一个算起来的。”四婆婆道：“好吧！你自己会算，吃了饭给我算算。”
    吃完饭，四婆婆从房子里取出一个不太厚的小方格本子来，往翠英身边一丢说：“你数数吧！”翠英翻开一看里面密密地写满了许多字。有的是日常生活用品之类的，如“衣服”啦，“碗筷”啦；如“犁耙”啦，“打谷机”啦；有的是身体上的名称，如“手脚”啦，等等。字字写得那么端端正正，清清秀秀。翠英一数，足足四百来个。
    翠英简直不能相信这是四婆婆写的，也不能相信她认得出。心里要想试试她，就随便指几个自己所认识的字问她，四婆婆答得没半点错——音正字义也明白。这一来，可把翠英弄得又尴尬又想不通。从没看见婆婆抱过书本念，也没看过她坐在桌上写，她是用什么巧妙的方法弄熟了这么多的字呢？她只好慢慢地追问婆婆，李四婆婆便忍不住笑起来，一五一十地讲出她学习的故事。
    “去年冬天，民校搬得那么远，我晚上看不清路，有什么办法上学呢？不学吗，以后一家人都会认字，看报，只剩下我一个‘瞎子’，我是不甘心的。于是我打定了主意，要自个学，同你比一比。我托别人上街买一斤白布屑，把它剪成一个个小方块，每天到外面找人问一两个字，请他们给我写在小布块上。人家给我写好了，我就把小布块贴在物件上。比如衣字吧，我就钉在衣上；被字吧，我就钉在被子上；手字吧，贴在手臂上；碗字吧，贴在碗底下。这样，字跟物件走，物件跟人走，就时时可以练字。走路用指头在空中练；吃饭用筷子在碗里练；洗衣用木杆在水上练，睡觉用指头在肚子上练。练来练去，字练熟了，我才往本子上写。这就不单字记得牢，也写得好哩！……”
    翠英静静地听着，全神贯注地瞧着婆婆的神态，仿佛她在瞧着一个陌生人说话那样。而李四婆婆则越说声音越嘹亮，神情越健旺、充沛。说到最后，她脸庞竟涌现了一股年轻人的微笑。
