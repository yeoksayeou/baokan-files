    The Soviet Union Strengthens Ideological Education in Universities

    (Dispatch from our newspaper) According to Soviet press reports, Party organizations, Communist Youth League organizations, and educators in Moscow, Leningrad, and other places have recently held many meetings to study the issue of strengthening ideological education in universities.

    At a meeting convened by the Moscow City Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, presidents and Party and League secretaries of Moscow universities emphasized the need to strengthen ideological education in universities and to strengthen the Party's leadership over the Communist Youth League in universities. In the past, due to some shortcomings in this work, a few students were sometimes easily influenced by bourgeois ideology and developed unhealthy sentiments.

    An editorial entitled "Educational Work in Higher Education Institutions," recently published in the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee's official journal "Party Life," pointed out that teachers have a great influence on students in universities, and Party organizations should mobilize teachers' enthusiasm to do a good job in ideological education for students. The editorial said: "After the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, the enthusiasm of young university students and their demand for a deeper and more comprehensive analysis of theory, policy, and current affairs have greatly increased. However, not all social science teachers can meet the students' growing demands. ... If a university student's questions are not answered, he will still look for answers. Evading answering students' questions naturally creates possibilities for rumors and relaxes the struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas that infiltrate from abroad through radio and newspapers."

    The editorial emphasized the importance of Party organizations in universities strengthening their leadership over the Communist Youth League and strengthening their ties with League members, because 80% to 90% of university students are League members. The editorial called on Party organizations in universities to specifically help the Communist Youth League overcome the phenomenon of detachment from reality in their work.

    The editorial also criticized some universities for neglecting discipline education, resulting in a slackening of discipline among students. The editorial pointed out that one of the most important conditions for improving cadre training work is to have strong discipline, strict systems, and strict requirements.

    To better train university students ideologically and in their daily lives, recent Soviet conferences and newspaper articles have discussed the necessity of changing the enrollment system. At a recent meeting convened by the Moscow City Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet Minister of Higher Education, Yelyutin, pointed out that the majority of students enrolled in universities should have engaged in production for at least two years or served in the military.

    苏联加强大学思想教育工作
    本报讯　据苏联报刊报道：莫斯科、列宁格勒等地的党组织、青年团组织和教育工作者，最近举行了许多会议研究加强大学中的思想教育工作问题。
    在苏联共产党莫斯科市委会召开的会议上，莫斯科各大学的校长和党、团组织的书记都强调要加强大学中的思想教育工作，加强大学中党对青年团的领导。过去，由于在这项工作中有些缺点，所以少数学生有时容易受资产阶级思想的影响，产生不健康的情绪。
    苏共中央机关刊物“党的生活”最近发表的一篇题为“高等学校中的教育工作”的社论指出：在大学中，教员对学生的影响很大，党组织应当发动教员的积极性，作好对学生的思想教育工作。社论说：“苏共第二十次代表大会以后，青年大学生的积极性和他们对更深入的、全面的分析理论、政策、时事问题的要求大大地提高了。但是，并不是所有的社会科学的教员都能满足学生们日益增长的要求。……如果大学生提的问题得不到解答，他还是要寻找答案的。回避回答学生的问题，这就自然而然为谣言创造了可能性，放松了对那些通过无线电、报刊从外国侵入的资产阶级和小资产阶级思想的斗争”。
    社论强调了大学中党组织加强对青年团的领导、加强同团员联系的重要性。因为大学生中有80％到90％都是团员。社论号召大学中的党组织要具体地帮助青年团克服工作中脱离实际的现象。
    社论还批评了某些大学忽视纪律教育，以致在学生中产生纪律松弛的现象。社论指出，改进培养干部工作的一个最重要的条件，就是要有坚强的纪律、严格的制度和严格的要求。
    为了使大学生在思想上和生活上有更好的锻炼，苏联有关会议和报刊的文章中，最近都谈到了改变招生制度的必要性。苏联高等教育部部长叶留金在最近苏共莫斯科市委召开的一次会议上指出：大学招收的大多数学生，都应当至少从事过两年生产，或在军队中服过役。
