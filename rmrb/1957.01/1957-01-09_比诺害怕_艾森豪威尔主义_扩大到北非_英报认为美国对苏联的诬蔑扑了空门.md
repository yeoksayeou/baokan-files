Xinhua News Agency, January 8th, New York News: French Foreign Minister Bidault, who arrived in New York from Paris on the 7th, when asked by reporters if he believed that "the Eisenhower Doctrine would expand to North Africa," replied: Currently, the entire situation in North Africa should be separated from the Middle East. "It is not part of the Middle East situation," but a "separate issue" with different problems.

Xinhua News Agency, London, January 8th: British newspapers, in their comments on Eisenhower's Middle East plan, expressed complex feelings: on the one hand, they had to express welcome, while at the same time appearing to have unspoken grievances.

The latest issue of "The Economist" magazine said, "Britain is temporarily unable to do anything else and can only stand aside, avoiding making things worse. It can only welcome the decision of the United States, which is unwilling to remain inactive."

Most conservative newspapers expressed welcome for the U.S.'s anti-Soviet attitude, but they pointed out that the Eisenhower plan, having chosen the so-called "Soviet aggression" as its target, did not "hit the mark."

The "Financial Times" said: The serious problems in the Middle East "are currently the issues of relations between Israel and the Arabs and the control of the Suez Canal." It said: "What is causing anxiety and danger is not a primary issue like a world conflict with the Russians, but secondary issues that, if not resolved for a long time, could gradually cause such a conflict."

The "Daily Sketch" said that the threat from the Soviet Union is non-existent. This newspaper believes that the United States should save Britain's rule in the Arab East, for example, by exerting pressure on Egypt. The newspaper sadly wrote that the Anglo-American alliance "was never consistent on the Suez issue.

Washington took a two-faced stance from the beginning and later showed open hostility. Now we see something that is very indifferent to Britain's vital interests."

    比诺害怕“艾森豪威尔主义”扩大到北非
    英报认为美国对苏联的诬蔑扑了空门
    新华社8日讯　纽约消息：7日从巴黎到达纽约的法国外交部长比诺，在记者问到他是不是相信“艾森豪威尔主义会扩大到北非”时，回答说：目前，北非的整个局势应该同中东分开。“它不是中东局势的一部分”。而是一个有着不同问题的“单独问题”。
    据新华社伦敦8日电　英国报刊在评论艾森豪威尔的中东计划的时候，表现了复杂的感情：一方面既不得不表示欢迎，同时又显得有苦说不出。
    最近一期“经济学家”杂志说，“英国暂时无力干别的，只好站在一边，避免再把事情弄糟，它也只能欢迎美国这个不愿再处于不活动状态的决定。”
    大部分保守的报纸表示欢迎美国的反苏态度，可是它们指出，艾森豪威尔计划选定所谓“苏联侵略”作为它的打击目标，结果并没有“击中要害”。
    “金融时报”说：中东的严重问题“在目前是以色列和阿拉伯之间的关系问题和苏伊士运河的控制权问题”。它说：“引起不安和危险的，并不是同俄国人发生世界冲突这样一个首要问题，而是那些如果长期不解决就可能逐步造成这种冲突的次要的问题。”
    “每日简报”说，来自苏联的威胁是不存在的。这家报纸认为，美国应当挽救英国在阿拉伯东方的统治，例如对埃及施加压力。报纸悲痛地写道，但是，英美同盟“在苏伊士问题上没有一次是协调一致的。
    华盛顿从一开始就采取了两面的立场，后来表现出公开的敌对态度。现在我们看到了某种对英国的切身重要的利益非常漠不关心的事情。”
