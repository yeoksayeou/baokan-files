    Seeing "Mi Sanxian" in Xi'an
    Jiang Che
    When I arrived in Xi'an, I was surprised by the people's passionate love for Qinqiang opera.
    At night, walking along the streets, one could often hear the melodious sounds of the Qin from teahouses and people singing loudly. No matter which Qinqiang opera theater you went to, it was always full of people. If there was a loudspeaker outside the theater, the front would be crowded with Qinqiang enthusiasts...
    One night, I found the Tongzhou Bangzi theater in a narrow alley. Inside, the ground was made of yellow earth, and the roof was a reed mat. The corridors were also filled with spectators, and above them, it was open to the sky, where you could see the stars. Watching the Tongzhou Bangzi, full of rural flavor, in such a rural-style theater would be a very pleasant experience.
    Tongzhou Bangzi is popular in Huayin and Dali areas of Shaanxi and is also called the East Road Qinqiang. It is said to be the oldest type of Qinqiang, but it has declined in recent decades, and few people can perform it. This time, the Shaanxi Provincial Bureau of Culture rescued this opera genre by excavating traditional plays and found old artists from various places to perform in Xi'an. According to the posters posted in front of the theater, the vast majority of these artists were in their sixties and seventies. Their stage names were very fresh, such as Meng Kaihua, Haiwazi, Maier, Baosenzi, Mi Sanxian, etc. That night, I watched "Broken Bridge" performed by the seventy-one-year-old Mi Sanxian (original name Zhu Linfeng) and the seventy-year-old Zhao Donglang.
    Unexpectedly, the seventy-one-year-old Mi Sanxian played the White Snake so beautifully. Coming on stage, she widened her eyes and looked around, sometimes staggering as if about to fall, sometimes covering her stomach with her hands, walking with difficulty. Her face revealed expressions of panic, fatigue, and pain, instantly presenting to the audience the image of a White Snake who was pregnant, full of worries, and chased by heavenly soldiers and generals. It wasn't until Qing'er appeared that we saw the White Snake felt the presence of a loved one, calling Qing'er while relaxing her whole body and falling to the ground...
    I had seen "Broken Bridge" before, but it had never given me such a profound impression. Some of the old artist's kneeling and standing up movements were indeed not agile enough, but from the entire performance, his every gesture and step could be said to be very accurate and beautiful. What was particularly touching was his meticulous and serious spirit on stage.
    The scene where the White Snake and Qing'er walked down the mountain was also very moving. They walked back and forth together from the left and right sides of the stage. At first, the White Snake supported Qing'er, singing softly, but the more she sang, the tighter it became, and the faster she walked. Later, she didn't need Qing'er's care at all. At that time, her light steps and the gesture of waving her hands were really beautiful. When I squinted my eyes to look, the stage looked like an eighteen or nineteen-year-old girl singing and dancing lightly. No wonder the people of eastern Shaanxi didn't call him by his real name, but called him Mi Sanxian!
    I heard that the tone of the East Road Qinqiang is the sharpest, but after listening to Zhu Linfeng sing the long passage of "Ten Hatefuls," I felt it was very clear and melodious, high-pitched but not harsh. It was just that he was already seventy-one years old, and some parts sounded a bit hoarse.
    The next day, I went to visit Zhu Linfeng. To my surprise, he was a lame man with a cane. The pair of reading glasses on his wrinkled face also covered the bright eyes I had seen the night before. He said to me, "I originally said I wouldn't perform 'Broken Bridge.' I don't know how many young girls have performed this play. It's no good for an old man like me to perform it again, but the comrades from the Bureau of Culture kept saying it was okay, you see..."
    Zhu Linfeng told me that during the Guangxu years of the Qing Dynasty, there were four Tongzhou Bangzi troupes, two of which often performed in Beijing. After the Revolution of 1911, the troupe owners fell from power, and the artists formed their own troupes. Later, the warlords forcibly took their opera trunks, and then there were those years of famine, so some died and some changed careers. Zhu Linfeng started learning opera in a training class when he was young, and his leg was crippled in 1927 when he followed Xie Zichang as a soldier and fought against the warlords. After that, he lived in a remote mountain village in Fuxian County, northern Shaanxi.
    The old man hadn't performed on stage for thirty years. He had grown a long beard, and although his eyes looked good, one of them was blind. When he heard that he and the old artists of his generation were to restore the lost Tongzhou Bangzi, he excitedly came to Xi'an and, along with Zhao Donglang and other four old men, shaved off their beards. Before shaving, they all took a photo, and they cherished and preserved the shaved beards as souvenirs.
    I asked him how he managed to make it difficult for the audience to see his bad legs on stage. He smiled and said, "I can't really explain it. Anyway, I feel energetic as soon as I get on stage and forget myself completely. I just think that the play should be done in a certain way, and I have to do it, and I don't feel the bad legs. I think my martial arts skills also have an influence!" Indeed, I heard that the old man still gets up to practice his skills before dawn sometimes.
    Since arriving in Xi'an, Mi Sanxian has encountered many happy things, twice so happy that he cried. One time was when he saw his fellow apprentices whom he had been separated from for decades and thought had already died. Everyone hugged each other and cried bitterly. The other time was when his daughter, who had been lost for more than twenty years, saw his name in the newspaper and sent a moving letter from the Fengcun Health Center in Dali County. The old man cried again, with mixed feelings of sorrow and joy.

### 在西安看“迷三县”

    在西安看“迷三县”
    江车
    到西安，我为西安的人们那样狂热地喜爱秦腔而吃惊了。
    夜晚，在街头走过，往往可以听到从茶馆里传出幽扬的琴声和听到有人引吭高歌；无论走到那个秦腔剧院里，人总是满满的，如果戏院门外放了个扩音器，那么门前就蹲满了秦腔迷……
    一个夜晚，我在一条窄巷里，找到了演同州梆子的剧场。场内是黄土地，顶上是席棚，两廊也都站满了观众，那上面是露天的，抬头就可以看到星星。在这样一个颇有农村风味的剧场里，看充满乡土气息的同州梆子该是一桩很写意的事了。
    同州梆子流行在陕西华阴、大荔一带，也称东路秦腔，听人说是秦腔里最老的一种，但近几十年却衰落得很少有人能演了。这次陕西省文化局为挽救这个剧种，发掘传统剧目，才从各地把老艺人们找来在西安公演。从戏院门前贴的海报上来看，这些艺人绝大多数是六七十岁的人了，那艺名有的很新鲜，如猛开花、海娃子、麦儿、宝森子、迷三县等，那一夜，我看的就是七十一岁的迷三县（原名朱林逢）和七十岁的赵东郎合演的“断桥”。
    想不到七十一岁的迷三县扮演的白娘子仍然俊丽动人。出场来，只见他圆睁双眼前后顾盼，一忽儿想踉跄地跌倒，一忽儿用手捂着肚子步履艰难，他的面部流露出惊慌、疲惫、痛楚的表情，一时把一个身怀有孕、满腹心事、又被天兵天将追赶着的白娘子的形象，在极短的时间内就呈现给观众了。直到青儿出场，我们才看到白娘子感到了亲人在旁，一边喊着青儿，一边混身松软下来跌坐在地上……。
    过去我看过“断桥”，但并没给我过如此深刻的印象。老艺人的某些跪倒起身等动作，确是有些不够利落，但从整个演出来看，他的一举手、一投足都可以说是十分准确和优美的，特别令人感动的是他在台上一丝不苟、郑重其事的精神。
    白娘子和青儿步行下山的一场戏也是十分动人的。他们一起由台的左右方往返着，起初白娘子还扶着青儿，一边轻声地歌唱着，但一路愈唱愈紧、愈走愈急，后来竟不用青儿的照顾。当时他那轻盈的步子，双手摇摆的姿态真是美极了，待我眯起眼睛来看时，台上宛如一个十八九岁的女郎在轻歌漫舞，莫怪陕东人民不叫他本名，却叫他迷三县！
    听人说东路秦腔的调子是最尖昂的，但听了朱林逢唱的大段“十可恨”，却觉得十分清晰婉转，虽高吭而不刺耳，只是他究竟已有七十一岁的高龄，有的地方显得有些沙哑罢了。
    第二天，我去看望了一下朱林逢。见了面，使我万分意外地，他竟是个扶着拐杖的跛脚人，而他多皱的脸上戴的一副老花镜，也把头天晚上我看到的他那灼灼发光的眼睛遮掩起来了。他跟我说：“俺本来说不演‘断桥’的，这出戏不知有多少小姑娘演过了，咱老汉再演这还行，文化局的同志尽说能行，你看……。”
    朱林逢告诉我，在前清光绪年间，同州梆子有四个班，有两个还常在北京演出，辛亥革命后，班主倒台，艺人们就自己成班，后来军阀强收了他们的戏箱，又搭上那些年闹饥荒，大家就死的死，改行的改行了。朱林逢从小入科班学戏，他的腿则是在1927年跟着谢子长当兵和军阀打仗时残废的。以后他就一直住在陕北鄜县的偏僻的山村里。
    老人已经有三十年没有登台演戏了，他已留了很长的胡子，眼睛虽然看上去很好，但有一只已失明。当他听到让他和他同代的老艺人们一起恢复演出失传的同州梆子时，他兴奋地来到西安，并和赵东郎等四个老汉一起剃掉了胡子，临剃前他们都照了个像，把剃下的胡子也都珍惜地保存着，留作纪念。
    我问他腿脚不好，何以在台上令观众不易看出的时候，他笑着说：“俺也有点说不上来，反正俺觉着一上了台就有了精神，把自己就全忘了。我只想戏该怎么做便都要做到了，腿脚不好也就觉不出来了。我看，我的武功好也有影响吧！”的确，到现在听说老先生有时还在天不亮时就起来练功。
    到了西安，迷三县碰到许多高兴的事，有两次高兴得都哭了。一次是看到了分别几十年、互以为早已死了的师兄弟们的时候，大家抱头痛哭了一场；一次是他失散了二十余年的女儿在报上看到他的名字，从大荔县冯村卫生所寄来一封令人感动的信的时候，老人又悲喜交加地痛哭了一场。
