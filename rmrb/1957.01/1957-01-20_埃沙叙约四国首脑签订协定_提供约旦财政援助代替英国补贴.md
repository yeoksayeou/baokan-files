Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 19th: The leaders of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Jordan, after holding talks in Cairo, today signed an agreement to provide financial aid to Jordan.

The agreement stipulates that Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria will jointly provide Jordan with 12.5 million Egyptian pounds in financial aid annually, with Egypt and Saudi Arabia each providing 5 million Egyptian pounds, and Syria providing 2.5 million Egyptian pounds. This financial aid is intended to replace the annual financial subsidies that Britain provides to Jordan. The Jordanian government had earlier stated that it would immediately abolish the enslaving British-Jordanian treaty after Jordan obtained financial aid from Arab countries to replace British financial subsidies.

Egyptian President Nasser, Saudi Arabian King Saud, Jordanian King Hussein and Prime Minister Nabulsi, and Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali began talks on the evening of the 18th. According to the Middle East News Agency, the issues discussed at the meeting were the general situation in the Middle East, Arab issues, and cooperation between Arab countries.

Prior to the meeting, Nasser had held separate talks with Saud and Hussein.

At another meeting held late on the 18th, Sabri, the Director of the Political Bureau of the Egyptian Presidential Palace and a member of the Egyptian delegation, presented a report on the results of the meetings held by Arab delegations some time ago.

It is reported that the King of Saudi Arabia will fly to Genoa, Italy today, from where he will travel by ship to New York for a visit to the United States.

    提供约旦财政援助代替英国补贴
    新华社开罗19日电　埃及、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚和约旦四国领导人在开罗举行会谈后，今天签订了一项向约旦提供财政援助的协定。
    这项协定规定，埃及、沙特阿拉伯和叙利亚每年将共同向约旦提供一千二百五十万埃镑的财政援助，其中埃及和沙特阿拉伯各提供五百万埃镑，叙利亚提供二百五十万埃镑。这项财政援助是用来代替英国每年给约旦的财政补贴的。约旦政府早些时候曾经声明，在约旦取得阿拉伯国家的财政援助以代替英国的财政补贴后，将立即废除奴役性的英国—约旦条约。
    埃及总统纳赛尔、沙特阿拉伯国王沙特、约旦国王侯赛尼和首相纳布西、叙利亚总理阿萨利从18日晚上开始会谈。据中东通讯社报道，会上讨论的问题是，中东的一般局势、阿拉伯问题和阿拉伯国家间的合作问题。
    在会议以前，纳赛尔曾经分别同沙特和侯赛尼举行了会谈。
    在18日深夜举行的另一次会议上，埃及总统府政治局局长、埃及代表团团员萨布里就前些时候阿拉伯各国代表团所举行的会议的结果提出了报告。
    据悉，沙特阿拉伯国王今天将乘飞机前往意大利的热那亚，从那里他将乘船到纽约去美国访问。
