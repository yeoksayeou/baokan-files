Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: According to TASS reports: The Kyrgyz Republic has been awarded the highest Soviet honor—the Order of Lenin—for its outstanding achievements in developing the production of sugar beets, cotton, and livestock products. On the 15th, at a grand meeting held in the National Opera and Ballet Theater in Frunze, the capital of the republic, Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, presented the Order of Lenin to the leaders of the republic.

At this meeting, attended by representatives of many working people from all over the republic and guests from other republics, Khrushchev, who was visiting the republic for the first time, delivered a speech.

Khrushchev first praised the great achievements made by the heroic labor of all the working people of the republic. He said that last year, the collective farms and state farms of the Kyrgyz Republic sold 395,000 tons more sugar beets than in 1955, with a harvest of 374 quintals per hectare. The state's cotton procurement plan has been overfulfilled, with a yield of 20.7 quintals of raw cotton per hectare, 3.6 quintals more than in 1955. The output of livestock products from the republic's collective farms and state farms has also increased.

Khrushchev said that the Kyrgyz people, like other peoples of Central Asia, have gone through a long and arduous historical road. In the past, this was a backward, uncultured, and impoverished nation. Landlords and capitalists cruelly plundered the working people.

However, under the Soviet system, the face of these republics has been completely changed! In the thirty-nine years of Soviet power, Kyrgyzstan, like other republics in Central Asia, has prospered as never before! The people of these republics have established their own industry and large-scale agriculture.

Khrushchev emphasized that this is the best illustration of the correctness of our party's policies and the correctness of the doctrine created by Marx and Lenin. This is a victory for Marxist-Leninist thought and a victory for the Leninist policy on nationalities of our party and government.

Subsequently, I. R. Razzakov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kyrgyzstan, spoke, thanking the party and government for awarding the highest award to the Kyrgyz Republic.

That evening, the working people of Frunze flocked to the "Spartak" Stadium and held a mass rally to celebrate the republic's receipt of the Order of Lenin.

At the meeting, Khrushchev once again congratulated Kyrgyzstan on winning the highest national award and wished the Kyrgyz people new achievements in building communism.

The participants in the meeting enthusiastically passed a letter of salute to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    吉尔吉斯共和国空前繁荣
    苏联党和政府授予列宁勋章
    赫鲁晓夫指出这是列宁主义民族政策的胜利
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社报道：吉尔吉斯共和国由于在发展甜菜、棉花、牧畜产品生产方面取得卓越的成就，荣获了苏联最高奖赏——列宁勋章。15日在共和国首都伏龙芝国家歌舞剧院举行的大会上，苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫把列宁勋章授给了共和国的领导人。
    在这个有共和国各地许多劳动人民代表和其他共和国客人参加的大会上，第一次来到这个共和国的赫鲁晓夫发表了演说。
    赫鲁晓夫首先称赞了共和国全体劳动人民的英勇劳动所获得的巨大成就。他说，吉尔吉斯共和国的集体农庄和国营农场去年比1955年多交售了三十九万五千吨甜菜，每公顷收割甜菜三百七十四公担。国家征购棉花的计划已经超额完成，每公顷能够收原棉二十点七公担，比1955年多收三点六公担。共和国的集体农庄和国营农场的畜牧业产品的产量也增加了。
    赫鲁晓夫说，吉尔吉斯人民像中亚细亚其他的人民一样，走过了一条漫长而艰巨的历史道路。过去，这里是一个落后的、没有文化的、贫困的民族。地主和资本家残忍地掠夺着劳动人民。
    但是，在苏维埃制度下，这些共和国的面貌已经完全改变了！吉尔吉斯在苏维埃政权的三十九年中，也像中亚细亚其他共和国一样空前地繁荣起来了。这些共和国的人民建立了自己的工业和大型农业。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，这最好不过地说明了我们党的政策的正确性，马克思和列宁创造的学说的正确性。这是马克思列宁主义思想的胜利，是我们党和政府的列宁主义民族政策的胜利。
    接着，吉尔吉斯共产党中央委员会第一书记伊·拉·拉凡科夫讲了话，他感谢党和政府给吉尔吉斯共和国的最高奖赏。
    这天傍晚，伏龙芝的劳动人民成群结队地来到“斯巴达克”运动场，举行了一个庆祝共和国荣获列宁勋章的群众大会。
    赫鲁晓夫在会上再一次祝贺吉尔吉斯荣获国家的最高奖赏，并且祝吉尔吉斯人民在建设共产主义方面取得新的成就。
    参加大会的人热情奋发地通过了向苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏联部长会议、苏联共产党中央委员会的致敬电。
