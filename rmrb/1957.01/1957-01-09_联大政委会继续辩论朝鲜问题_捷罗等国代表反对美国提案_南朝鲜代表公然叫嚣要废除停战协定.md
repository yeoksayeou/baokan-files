Xinhua News Agency, January 8th, New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee continued its debate on the Korean question on the 7th.

Under the manipulation of the United States, the South Korean representative, Yang Yu-chan, who was invited to attend the meeting, spoke first. He clamored for the abolition of the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement and the restoration of the "freedom of action" of South Korea and the so-called United Nations Command. Yang Yu-chan also demanded that so-called "free elections" be held in Korea under the supervision of one party to the Korean War—the United Nations.

Yang Yu-chan made unwarranted slanders against the Korean Armistice Supervisory Commission and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China.

The Czechoslovak representative, Winkler, condemned Yang Yu-chan's speech as insulting. He said that China has withdrawn a large number of troops from Korea. He also said that the United Nations report shows that South Korea is publicly and firmly demanding a substantial increase in its armed forces. Winkler said he would oppose the U.S. proposal on the Korean question.

The Romanian representative, Misincescu, said that the unification of Korea should first and foremost be a matter for the Koreans themselves to resolve. He said that the U.S. proposal is unrealistic, and Romania will vote against it. Misincescu condemned South Korea's continued attempts to eliminate the Democratic People's Republic of Korea by force.

The Indian representative, Menon, reported to the meeting on the situation of the Korean prisoners of war who went to India. When talking about the Korean unification issue, he said that Korea could only achieve unification with the consent of both North and South Koreans.

Menon expressed some doubts as to whether the U.S. proposal would help restore the unification of Korea. At the same time, he said that in order to maintain harmony, he would not propose amendments to the U.S. proposal.

The Sri Lankan representative, Perera, believed that the U.S. proposal had shortcomings. He said that the Sri Lankan delegation believes that a top-level meeting might resolve the problems that have been hindering a solution.

The Political Committee is scheduled to continue debating the Korean question on the 8th.

    捷罗等国代表反对美国提案
    南朝鲜代表公然叫嚣要废除停战协定
    据新华社8日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会7日继续辩论朝鲜问题。
    在美国操纵下被邀请出席会议的南朝鲜代表梁裕灿第一个发言，他叫嚣要废除1953年的朝鲜停战协定和恢复南朝鲜以及所谓联合国军司令部的“行动自由”。梁裕灿还要求在朝鲜战争的参加一方——联合国的监督下，在朝鲜举行所谓“自由选举”。
    梁裕灿对朝鲜停战监督委员会和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国进行了无端的污蔑。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表文克勒谴责梁裕灿的发言是侮辱性的。他说，中国已经从朝鲜撤退了大批军队。他又说，联合国的报告表明，南朝鲜却正在公然坚决要求大量增加它的武装部队。文克勒表示他将反对美国的朝鲜问题提案。
    罗马尼亚代表米辛契斯库说，统一朝鲜首先应该是朝鲜人自己来解决的事。他说，美国提案是不现实的，罗马尼亚将投票反对这个提案。米辛契斯库谴责南朝鲜还在企图以武力消灭朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。
    印度代表梅农向会议报告了前往印度的朝鲜战俘的情况。他在谈到朝鲜统一问题时说，只有得到南北朝鲜两部分朝鲜人的同意，朝鲜才能实现统一。
    梅农对美国提案能否有助于朝鲜恢复统一表示有些怀疑，同时，他又说，为了保持和谐，他将不对美国提案提出修正案。
    锡兰代表佩雷拉认为美国提案有不够之处。他说，锡兰代表团认为，一个最高级会议或许可以解决那些一直妨碍着解决的问题。
    政委会定在8日继续辩论朝鲜问题。
