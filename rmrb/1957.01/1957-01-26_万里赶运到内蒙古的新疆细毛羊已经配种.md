Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, January 25th: The first batch of Xinjiang fine-wool sheep, transported tens of thousands of miles to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region last autumn from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, has begun breeding. According to various breeding units, the Xinjiang sheep are highly adaptable and quickly become accustomed to the climate, water, and grass conditions of Inner Mongolia.

When the Xinjiang sheep arrived in Inner Mongolia last year after a three-month journey, it was already the season of whistling west winds and withered pasture, missing the opportunity to gain autumn fat and appearing somewhat thin. The Inner Mongolia state-owned farms and fine-wool sheep breeding stations quickly built sheds, stored fodder, and assigned special personnel to take care of them. Now, their physical strength has gradually recovered. The ewes have maintained a medium level of fatness, and the rams weigh approximately between 140 and 160 pounds, enabling them to safely survive the winter and spring.

In the Xilin Gol pasture, the conception rate of 1,024 Xinjiang ewes after mating reached over 97%. In addition, a group of Xinjiang rams were mated with Mongolian ewes, and the conception rate was also good. Around the Qingming Festival, this pasture will have more than 3,000 purebred fine-wool sheep and first-generation hybrid improved sheep of Xin(jiang)-Mongol(ian) descent.

The fine-wool sheep breeding stations established in Xilin Gol League, Bayannur League, and Yikezhao League, etc., used Xinjiang rams to breed with more than 7,000 local Mongolian ewes, with an estimated average conception rate of over 80%.

    万里赶运到内蒙古的新疆细毛羊已经配种
    新华社呼和浩特25日电　去年秋天从新疆维吾尔自治区万里赶运到内蒙古自治区的第一批新疆细毛羊，已经开始配种。据各饲养单位反映，新疆羊适应性很强，对内蒙古的气候水草等条件很快就习惯了。
    新疆羊去年经过三个月行程赶到内蒙古的时候，已经是西风萧杀，牧草枯黄的季节，错过了抓秋膘时机，显得有些消瘦。内蒙古国营牧场和绵羊良种培育站赶快修建棚舍，贮备饲草饲料，指定专人负责照料。现在，它们的体力已逐渐恢复。母羊保住了中等膘，公羊的体重大约在一百四十斤到一百六十斤之间，能够安全越冬渡春。
    在锡林郭勒牧场里的一千零二十四只新疆母羊，配种后受胎率达97％强。另外一群新疆种公羊同蒙古种母绵羊交配，受胎情况也较好。清明前后，这座牧场里将出现三千多只纯种细毛羊和新（疆）蒙（古）第一代杂种改良羊。
    设立在锡林郭勒盟、巴彦淖尔盟、伊克昭盟等地的绵羊良种培育站，用新疆种公羊给当地七千多只蒙古种母绵羊配了种，估计受胎率平均在80％以上。
