Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, January 2nd: The "Road to Happiness" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, actively developed sideline production and diversified operations after agricultural production suffered from disaster, ensuring that most members still increased their income.

The "Road to Happiness" Agricultural Cooperative suffered three consecutive floods in the summer of 1956, and grain output only reached 54.6% of the plan. In order to make up for the losses caused by the disaster and do a good job in production and disaster relief, the cooperative organized members to carry out a variety of sideline productions based on local natural conditions. More than 120 members have now gone into the mountains to clear thinned timber from the forest farm according to the national plan. More than 70 members have gone to a stone mountain near the cooperative to mine stones and supply them to factories for building houses. In addition to organizing male members to cut wild grass and female members to make straw ropes and weave kang mats, the cooperative also maintains close contact with nearby wineries, coal mines, sanatoriums, etc., and organizes members to work when these units need to build dormitories, install utility poles, or repair stoves. In this way, most members have work to do and can earn a certain income.

As a result of the cooperative's development of diversified sideline production, according to the year-end budget for 1956, each work day can be distributed with 1.19 yuan. The income of each of the 400 new cooperative member households increased by about 80% compared to 1955. Only the income of the old cooperative members decreased compared to the bumper harvest year of 1955, but with the addition of household sideline income, their lives are still very good.

    农业生产受灾减产，用副业生产弥补起来
    幸福之路社多数社员仍能增加收入
    新华社长春2日电　吉林省蛟河县幸福之路农业生产合作社在农业受灾后积极开展副业生产和多种经营，保证多数社员仍然增加了收入。
    幸福之路农业社1956年夏季连续遭受三次水灾，粮食产量仅达到计划的54.6％。为了弥补受灾损失，做好生产救灾工作，这个社根据当地的自然条件，组织社员开展了多种多样的副业生产。现在已有一百二十多个社员进山，根据国家计划去清理林场间伐林木。还有七十多名社员到社附近的一座石山上开采石头，供应工厂修建房舍。另外，这个社除组织男社员打野草和女社员打草绳、编炕席外，还和附近的葡萄酒厂、煤矿、疗养院等保持密切联系，当这些单位要修盖宿舍、安装电线杆子、修锅台等，就组织社员去做工。这样就做到大部分社员都有活干，都能获得一定的收入。
    这个社开展多种副业生产的结果，据1956年年末预算，全年每个劳动日能分到一元一角九分钱。有四百户新社员每户约比1955年增加收入80％左右。仅老社员比1955年丰收年成减少收入，但如加上家庭副业收入，生活仍然很不错。
