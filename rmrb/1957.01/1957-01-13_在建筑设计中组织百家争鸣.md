Organizing the Hundred Schools of Thought in Architectural Design
Li Zhengguan, Dean of the Civil Architectural Design Institute of the Ministry of Urban Construction

Architectural design is a creative labor based on modern science and art. It requires not only rich theoretical knowledge of natural and social sciences but also rich experience in real life. Any complex architectural design cannot be monopolized by the wisdom of one person and reach a perfect level. Therefore, organizing the "Hundred Schools of Thought" in architectural design to improve the quality of architectural design is an urgent problem to be solved.

Our Civil Architectural Design Institute has tried out two "solicitations" of design plans and used a competition and evaluation method to modify old drawings once. Organizing "solicitations" is actually organizing architectural design competitions. According to our understanding, this is a better way to organize the Hundred Schools of Thought in the architectural field. Although there are many shortcomings in the methods of "solicitation" due to lack of experience, the overall effect is good.

These two "solicitations" included one for draft standard designs for housing in 1957. Twenty-five people responded, submitting a total of thirty-seven plans. After evaluation, revision, and re-evaluation, after several repeated discussions and studies, seven people won first prize. The seven plans had different approaches, not only breaking the rigid floor plan layout of past standard designs but also achieving practicality, economy, and rationality. The other was for the design of the Ministry of Foreign Trade's Export Building. This project is located on a main road in Beijing, which is important for international appearances. It was originally designed by our institute's Fourth Studio, but in order to strive for perfection, the entire institute was mobilized for "solicitation." Thirty-three people responded, with forty-two plans. It was truly dazzling and beautiful. In the end, Tao Zongzhen's plan was selected.

One old drawing modification refers to the preliminary design of the Tianqiao Hotel in Beijing. Although this preliminary design had been reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Urban Construction, when we conducted an inspection in conjunction with the central government's instructions on saving steel and cement, we found that the original design used too much steel. We then organized forces to redo comparative plans on the principle that the original shape, height, and number of floors would not be significantly changed. After several repeated comparisons and studies, everyone agreed that the new plan was significantly better than the original plan. The traffic flow and lounge in the lobby of the new plan are clear and suitable, reducing the repetition of lobbies on each floor, making it economical and reasonable. Although the facade has not changed much, it is more comfortable and lighter than before, better expressing the character of an apartment-style hotel building. More importantly, the new plan has great economic significance in terms of building layout and structural arrangement. According to preliminary estimates, a total of more than 3,000 square meters of building area can be saved in four buildings, saving more than 200 tons of steel and 600 cubic meters of concrete. The total of the above three items can save the state more than 500,000 yuan, and there are 56 more rooms than the original plan.

Through these two "solicitations" and one old drawing modification, people were greatly shaken, old regulations and old practices were broken, and new opinions and new atmospheres emerged. Although a few older technicians were not active enough in participating in the competition, the mood of rubbing their fists and eager to try was always expressed in words. The young technicians were even more active, and new forces continued to emerge. Tao Zongzhen, mentioned earlier, graduated from the Department of Architecture of Tsinghua University in 1952. He was originally a fourth-level technician and has now been promoted to a ninth-level engineer. He has shown outstanding achievements in both "solicitations."

What should we pay attention to when organizing "solicitations" and launching the "Hundred Schools of Thought" in architectural design?

According to our experience, first, we must pay attention to the unity of new and old technical personnel. The former refers to students who have graduated from universities, colleges, and secondary technical schools in the past three to five years, and the latter refers to people who have been engaged in architectural design work before liberation or transferred from other industries after liberation. These two types of people have their own strengths and weaknesses. They are the main force in the design team. Most of them cooperate well, but some people still have some estrangement or opinions, and the unharmonious emotions seem to have increased in the "Hundred Schools of Thought." Some technical personnel, including a few responsible persons, have some resistance to "solicitation" in their thinking and emotions. When soliciting designs for the Ministry of Foreign Trade's Export Building, some architects said: "Calling on the little soldiers to solicit designs is an unprecedented joke!" They also said: "One solicitation, two solicitations, when will the solicitation end!" This kind of emotion is obviously not conducive to the "Hundred Schools of Thought." Therefore, it is very important to pay attention to strengthening unity, especially the unity of new and old technical personnel, in the "Hundred Schools of Thought."

Second, correctly treat the issue of collective wisdom and independent thinking. Organizing "solicitations" and launching the "Hundred Schools of Thought" requires the spirit of collective wisdom. Some designers do not allow others to offer opinions on their works. Even if they hear good suggestions, they are unwilling to modify them, as if accepting other people's opinions would make their "martial arts" seem not high and damage their "face." This is obviously wrong. However, collective wisdom is by no means a simple addition of many opinions, but the designer himself has no opinion, swaying with the wind, or even considering personal gains and losses, catering to and accommodating everywhere, and casually abandoning correct opinions, perfunctorily dealing with things. If this is the case, it is also a manifestation of a lack of responsibility and dedication. Therefore, the "Hundred Schools of Thought" in architectural design should promote mutual learning, allow mutual absorption of advantages, and several plans can be combined into one plan; but at the same time, it must also give the design leader the convenience and conditions for highly independent thinking and giving play to their own original spirit. It should not be restricted too strictly, otherwise, piecing together will only create a shabby and fragmented patchwork, damaging the integrity and unity of the architectural design. Therefore, when evaluating design plans, we should give participants as much time as possible to fully exhibit, comment, and defend, and each plan should be discussed, pointing out its advantages and disadvantages. Doing so can educate and exercise everyone, make the evaluation results more fair and reasonable, everyone is calm and peaceful, and reduce some unnecessary entanglements. In the past, we have not done enough in this regard.

Third, the direction of architectural design. Since the "Hundred Schools of Thought," this direction is inevitably involved. Since opposing waste and formalism in architecture in 1954, many architects have made good progress in paying attention to economy and applicability and opposing flashy things, but the question that follows is where is architectural design going? On this issue, many people feel depressed. We believe that the premise for solving this problem must be clear that there is a direction for architectural design, and that is applicability, economy, and beauty under possible conditions. The problem is that there are not many such works at present. But this is not something to worry about. Architectural design is originally a creation, not copying and transporting. It is impossible to find someone to give a typical demonstration, and everyone else will copy it. The "Hundred Schools of Thought" is precisely to give play to the wisdom of the vast number of architectural designers under this direction, organize them to correctly combine modern architectural technology, building materials, and construction conditions with the architectural forms that are popular with the people of our country and local people, and create applicable, economical, and beautiful architectural designs. If you deviate from this direction, it is equivalent to deviating from the party's policies, which is wrong. Therefore, in launching the "Hundred Schools of Thought" in architectural design, we must pay attention to guiding architectural designers to think along the direction proposed by the party, especially we must pay attention to guiding designers to always pay attention to practicing thrift and resolutely implement the long-term policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, and never spend money that can be avoided, and spend less money that can be spent less.

Fourth, leadership issues. The above-mentioned points are of course also an important part of leading the "Hundred Schools of Thought" in the architectural design field, but there are still some issues that need to be paid attention to in the "solicitation." The most important thing here is that we must always care about the situation of the "solicitation," be good at discerning the struggle between the new and the old, the advanced and the backward from the debate of differing opinions, resolutely support the former, and persuade and drive the latter. Ambiguous and accommodating attitudes are undesirable. Originally, there are two ways to do things. One is to do everything according to the old way. On the surface, it seems calm and stable, but the development of the cause and the development of people are unfortunately stagnated there, and progress is very slow. The other way is to open up and move the work, and people advance in an unconventional way in the contradiction, development, and change of innovation and conservatism, advanced and backwardness, and activity and passivity. This latter approach is what we advocate. Organizing "solicitations" and launching the "Hundred Schools of Thought" is precisely to achieve this requirement. How can it work if there is no determination to organize debates in the "solicitation" and "鳴" without "爭"!

In the past, we also had a situation in "solicitation" where we were afraid of failing and causing delays. Therefore, we adopted the method of first assigning the task to a special studio or person in charge, and then handling the solicitation, so that if the "solicitation" fails, there will be a special person responsible for the design. In this way, the relationship is complicated and things are difficult to handle. Later, it was changed to be handled by the institute uniformly, and the selected applicants would serve as the person in charge of the project design and be responsible for carrying out the design to the end.

It should also be explained that through "solicitation," organizing the "Hundred Schools of Thought" can improve design quality and the designers themselves. However, "solicitation" cannot become the only magic weapon for leading design work. It is not necessary to "solicit" every project that is received. Because in that case, the tasks will not be balanced, and the busy and idle will inevitably be uneven. Some special buildings require certain specialized knowledge that ordinary architects do not have. In order to design it, you must first learn it, so it is too late to use the "solicitation" method. Some buildings require urgent output time, and "solicitation" cannot be done. Therefore, we believe that "solicitation" has limitations and scope. In addition to the necessary time conditions, this is: 1. Buildings with high architectural art and technical requirements; 2. Buildings with commemorative and representative significance; 3. Important group arrangements (ie, general plan arrangements); 4. Important standard designs.

In addition, we should also encourage designers to strengthen scientific research and artistic cultivation, strive for hard study, encourage them to write books and articles, make reports, ask questions, and make proposals, and make the entire architectural community active.

    在建筑设计中组织百家争鸣
    城市建设部民用建筑设计院院长　李正冠
    建筑设计是建立在近代科学、艺术水平上的一种创造性的劳动，它不仅需要丰富的自然科学和社会科学的理论知识，而且需要丰富的现实生活的体验。任何一项比较复杂的建筑设计，决不是一个人的智慧所能包办、并达到尽善尽美的水平的。因此在建筑设计中组织“百家争鸣”，以提高建筑设计质量，是一个急待解决的问题。
    我们民用建筑设计院曾试办了两次设计方案“征稿”，并用竞赛评选的方法进行过一次旧图修改。组织“征稿”，实际上就是组织建筑设计竞赛。根据我们的认识，这是在建筑界组织百家争鸣的一种较好的形式。虽然由于没有经验，“征稿”的方式方法还有许多不妥之处，但从总的效果看，收获是良好的。
    这两次“征稿”，一次是征集1957年住宅标准设计草图，应征者二十五人，共投三十七个方案，经过评比、修正、再评比，数次反复讨论研究，获甲等奖的七人。这七个方案中处理方法都有不同，不但打破了过去标准设计中呆板的平面布局，并且做到适用、经济、合理。另一次是征集对外贸易部出口大楼的设计。这项工程地当北京市区要道，有关国际观瞻，原由我院四室负责设计，后为精益求精，发动全院“征稿”，应征者三十三人，方案四十二个，真是琳琅满目，美不胜收，最后选中了陶宗震的方案。
    一次旧图修改，指的是北京天桥宾馆的初步设计。这个初步设计虽然已经城市建设部审核批准，但当我们结合中央提出的节约钢材、水泥的指示进行检查时，发现原设计中钢筋使用过多。我们就组织力量，在原体形、高度、层数不作重大变更的原则下，重做比较方案。经过几次反复比较研究，大家一致认为新方案显著优于原方案。新方案门厅部分交通线路和休息室布置得清楚合适，减少了层层楼上门厅重复的现象，作到经济合理。立面虽未大动，但较前舒适轻快，更好地表现了公寓式旅馆建筑的性格。更重要的是，新方案在建筑布置和结构安排上都有极大的经济意义，经初步估算，四幢楼共可节约建筑面积三千多平方公尺，节约钢材二百多吨，混凝土六百立方公尺，以上三项合计可以为国家节约五十多万元，还比原方案多出了五十六个房间。
    通过这两次“征稿”和一次旧图修改，真是大大震动人心，打破了过去的旧章程、旧做法，出现了新舆论、新气象。老技术人员中虽然还有个别人参加竞赛不够积极，但磨拳擦掌、跃跃欲试的心情，是随时流于言表的。青年技术人员中更是活跃，新生力量不断涌现。前面提到的陶宗震同志，就是1952年清华大学建筑系的毕业生，原为四级技术员，现在已提为九级工程师，在两次“征稿”中都表现了突出的成绩。
    在建筑设计中组织“征稿”，发动“百家争鸣”，要注意一些什么问题呢？
    根据我们的体会，第一、要注意新老技术人员的团结问题。前者指最近三、五年内大学、专科和中等技术学校毕业的学生，后者指解放前即从事建筑设计工作或解放后转业的其他人员。这两种人互有长短，都是设计队伍中的主力，他们之间多数人合作还好，但也有些人存有某些隔膜或意见，在“百家争鸣”中不融洽的情绪似乎有所增长。有的技术人员，包括少数负责人员在内，在思想上和感情上，对“征稿”就有一些抵触。在征集对外贸易部出口大楼的设计时，有的建筑师就说：“叫小兵去征稿，开各院未有之笑例！”又说：“一征稿，二征稿，征得何时了！”这种情绪显然是不利于“百家争鸣”的。因此，在“百家争鸣”中注意加强团结，特别是新老‘技术’人员的团结，是很重要的。
    第二、正确地对待集思广益和独立思考的问题。组织“征稿”，发动“百家争鸣”，需要有集思广益的精神。有的设计人员不许别人对自己的作品提意见，听了很好的建议，也不愿动手修改，好像接受了人家的意见，就显得自己的“武艺”不高，有损“体面”，这显然是错误的。但是，集思广益决不是许多意见的简单加法，而设计人本身反而毫无主见，随风摇摆，甚至顾虑个人得失，到处附和迁就，随便放弃正确意见，马马虎虎应付了事。如果是这样的话，这也是一种缺乏责任心和事业心的表现。所以，建筑设计中的“百家争鸣”，要提倡互相学习，允许互相吸取优点，可以合数方案为一方案；但同时也必须给设计负责人以高度独立思考、发挥自己独创精神的便利和条件，不应限制过严过死，否则东拚西凑，只会作成一件寒伧破碎的百衲衣，损害了建筑设计的完整性和统一性。因此在评比设计方案时，要尽可能给以比较宽裕的时间，使参加者充分展览、评论和答辩，对每一方案都应加以讨论，指出优点、缺点。这样做，才能使大家得到教育和锻炼，使评比结果更为公平合理，人人心平气和，减少某些不必要的纠缠。过去我们在这方面做得还很不够。
    第三、建筑设计的方向问题。既然“百家争鸣”，必然牵涉到这个方向问题。自从1954年反对建筑中的浪费和形式主义倾向之后，许多建筑师在注意经济适用，反对华而不实方面，都有了良好的进步，但跟着来的问题是建筑设计往何处去？在这个问题上，许多人都感到苦闷。我们认为解决这个问题的前提，必须明确建筑设计的方向是有的，这就是适用、经济和在可能条件下的美观。问题是目前这样的作品还不很多。但这并不是什么令人发愁的事情，建筑设计本来就是创作，而不是抄袭和搬运，不可能找一个人来个典型示范，别人都去照样翻版。“百家争鸣”正是为了在这个方向底下，发挥广大建筑设计人员的智慧，组织他们正确地把近代建筑技术、建筑材料和施工条件，充分地同我国和当地人民群众所喜闻乐见的建筑形式结合起来，创造出适用、经济、美观的建筑设计来。如果离开了这个方向，就等于离开了党的政策，那是不对的。因此，在建筑设计中发动“百家争鸣”，必须注意引导建筑设计人员循着党所提出的方向思索，特别是必须注意引导设计人员经常注意厉行节约，坚决贯彻勤俭建国的长远方针，能不花的钱，一定不花，能少花的钱，一定少花。
    第四、领导问题。上面谈到的几点，当然也是领导建筑设计界“百家争鸣”的重要部分，但在“征稿”中还有一些问题需要注意。这里面最主要的就是必须时刻关怀“征稿”的情况，要善于从分歧意见的争论中，洞察新和旧，先进和落后的斗争，坚决支持前者，说服和带动后者。模棱两可，一味息事宁人的态度是要不得的。本来，事情就有两种做法，一种是一切照老样子办事，表面看来，风平浪静，四平八稳，但事业的发展、人的发展，却不幸地停滞在那里，进展很慢。另一种做法是把工作搞开、搞动、人们在革新和守旧，先进和落后，积极和消极的矛盾、发展、变动中破格前进。这后一种做法才是我们所提倡的。组织“征稿”，发动“百家争鸣”也正是为了达到这个要求。在“征稿”中没有组织争论的决心，“鸣”而不“争”怎么行呢！
      我们过去在“征稿”中还有一种情况，怕搞不成反而误事，因此采取了先将任务分配专室专人负责，然后再办理征稿的办法，以便“征稿”不成，也有专人负责设计。这样一来，关系复杂了，事情难办了。以后才改由院统一办理，应征入选者就担任工程设计负责人，负责将这项设计进行到底。
    还需要说明一下的是通过“征稿”，组织“百家争鸣”，可以提高设计质量和设计人员本身。但“征稿”却不能成为领导设计工作的唯一法宝，不论什么工程拿到手都要“征稿”，那也大可不必。因为那样一来，任务将无法平衡，忙闲必然不均，有些特殊性建筑，需要一般建筑师所没有的某些专门知识，为了设计它，还必须先学习它，这样用“征稿”办法便来不及。有些建筑出图时间要求火急，“征稿”也办不到。因此，我们认为“征稿”是有限度、有范围的。除了需要必要的时间条件外，这就是：一、建筑艺术和技术要求较高的；二、有纪念性和代表性的；三、重要的群体布置（即总平面布置）；四、重要的标准设计。
    此外，还应提倡设计人员加强科学研究和艺术修养，力求刻苦深造，鼓励他们著书立说，写文章作报告，提疑问、提倡议，把整个建筑界搞得活跃起来。
