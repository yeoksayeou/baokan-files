    The Vietnamese Table Tennis Team's Last Match in Beijing

    (Our Dispatch) The Vietnamese Table Tennis team held its last friendly match with the Beijing team yesterday afternoon before leaving Beijing. The result of the match was that the Beijing team won two to zero in the two women's singles matches, and nine to zero in the nine singles matches of the men's team competition.

    In the two women's singles matches, Wang Yuqin, the 1956 Beijing table tennis champion, took the initiative and won three to zero. In the match between Vietnam's Zheng Shirun and Beijing's Zhang Baodi, Zheng Shirun used backhand and forehand counterattacks against Zhang Baodi's powerful smashes, making it sometimes difficult for Zhang Baodi to receive the ball. As a result of the match, Zhang Baodi won three to zero.

    In the men's team competition, Beijing's Liang Yuhai adopted continuous smashes, while Vietnam's Nguyen Khac Thinh hit back and saved many dangerous balls from a long distance, winning continuous applause from the audience. Vietnam's Huang Deguang was good at both attack and defense. His forehand and backhand shots were sometimes difficult to tell whether they were smashes or receptions, sometimes catching the opponent off guard. The Beijing team all adopted proactive attacks and smashes, resulting in a nine to zero victory.

    The Vietnamese Table Tennis Team will leave Beijing on the 8th of this month to go to Shanghai first, and then go to Guangzhou, Nanning, Zhuzhou and other places to conduct friendly matches. (Jiang Guangyu)
