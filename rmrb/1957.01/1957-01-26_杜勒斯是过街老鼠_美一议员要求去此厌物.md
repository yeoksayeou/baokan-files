Xinhua News Agency, January 25th, Washington Dispatch: United States Representative Stewart Udall requested the replacement of US Secretary of State Dulles on the 24th.

In a statement on the Middle East issue, Udall said: "Recent developments have convinced me that Secretary of State Dulles has not only lost the trust of our allies, but Congress is also increasingly skeptical of his diplomatic approach." He said, "As a national leader, Dulles' role has been greatly diminished, and the President would be wise to replace him."

Udall stated that he would support Eisenhower's Middle East plan in Congress. At the same time, he believes that this plan does not address "the root cause of the unrest in the Middle East."

    杜勒斯是过街老鼠
    美一议员要求去此厌物
    新华社25日讯　华盛顿消息：美国众议院议员斯图尔特·尤德尔24日要求撤换美国国务卿杜勒斯。
    尤德尔在他就中东问题所发表的一项声明中说：“最近的事态演变已经使我确定地认为，国务卿杜勒斯不仅丧失了我们的盟国的信任，而且国会也愈来愈怀疑他在外交方面的作法了。”他说，“作为一个国家领导人，杜勒斯的作用已经大大缩小，总统如果撤换他才是明智的。”
    尤德尔表示他将在国会里支持艾森豪威尔的中东计划。同时，他认为，这个计划没有谈到“中东不安局势的根源”。
