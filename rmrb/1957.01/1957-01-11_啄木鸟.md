    Woodpecker

    In the winter in Beijing, birds have vanished without a trace. Apart from the crows dotted on the bare trees, only woodpeckers can still be seen. Especially in the western suburbs where there are more trees, the clear sound of woodpeckers "logging" outside the window can be heard. Sometimes when you walk through the woods, if you follow the sound, it will fly around the tree, which is also quite interesting.
    From the small subject of the woodpecker, we can also see the excellence of ancient Chinese science. As early as the "Erya," there were records of woodpeckers. The Erya Explanation of Birds says: "Lie, chops wood." The commentary states: "The mouth is like a awl, several inches long, often chopping trees to eat insects, hence the name." The notes in the Book of Birds say: "The wood-chopping bird nests in wood. Its beak is like a chicken's, several inches long. It often chops and eats tree borers. When its beak vibrates against the wood, the insects all move." Li Shizhen, in the Compendium of Materia Medica, after compiling the sayings of his predecessors, also said: "Woodpeckers are small like sparrows, large like crows, with faces like peach blossoms, beaks and feet are all green, with strong claws and sharp beaks. The beak is like an awl, several inches long. The tongue is longer than the beak, and its end has thorns. It pecks out the borers and uses its tongue to hook them out and eat them." These words are all derived from scientific observation and are not much different from today's ornithologists' descriptions of woodpeckers. In addition, the woodpecker's feet are very strong, each with four toes, two forward and two backward (some have three toes), making it easy to climb trees and stand horizontally on the trunk. Its tail feathers are tough and used to support and balance its body as it clings to trees. Its nest in the wood is a hole that it chops itself, first from the bark to the heartwood, then downward, accommodating a nest of five or six smooth, white small eggs. There are many kinds of woodpeckers. In the Hebei area, "small ones like sparrows" include the "small woodpecker" and "flower woodpecker" in the Dongling forest; "large ones like crows" include the "mountain woodpecker," also known as the "fire crow." A species that can be seen all year round in the Beijing area is the "green woodpecker."
    The woodpecker's beak is very powerful. "Records of Strange Things" says: woodpeckers "are popularly said to be transformed from the medicine-collecting officers of the God of Thunder." This must have been imagined from its beak resembling the pointed mouth of the God of Thunder. The oak tree, which Europeans consider to be very strong, is still easily pecked through by it. Therefore, European folklore has a story of woodpeckers collecting fairy grass roots, saying that woodpeckers carrying this grass root will cause the holes in the tree trunk to open. The woodpecker doesn't want the used grass root to fall into the hands of people, so it burns it. Therefore, people spread a piece of red cloth under the tree, tricking the woodpecker into thinking it is fire, so that the grass root falls down. People who have this grass root can break free from chains and open treasures. This story can be found in Grimm's German fairy tales.
    Woodpeckers spend the whole year drumming, relying on logging to find insects, ants, and larvae on the trees. It lives entirely on trees and rarely comes to the ground. Grimm, in another Prussian story, says: at the beginning of the world, all the birds followed God's instructions to dig rivers and seas, but only the woodpecker disliked the mud being dirty and refused to go. Therefore, God later punished it to peck at trees and forbade it from going to the riverbank to quench its thirst, only allowing it to drink rainwater. Regarding the woodpecker's ability to eat insects, the Record of Diverse Matters says: This bird can draw characters with its beak, causing the insects to come out by themselves. This also exhausts the ability of imagination.
    A species of woodpecker in California often embeds acorns tightly in the tree trunk. The tree trunk is filled with them, and from a distance, it looks as if it is nailed with shiny copper nails. It turns out that the acorn shell seals maggots, which are the food they store.

    啄木鸟
    何东辉
    在北京的冬季，百鸟遁踪匿迹，除了枯树上的点点寒鸦以外，只有啄木鸟还可以见到。特别是在树木较多的西郊，不仅窗外啄木鸟的伐木声清脆可听；你有时走过林间，如果闻声去追寻，它便绕树而飞，那也是饶有趣味的。
    从啄木鸟这样一个细小的题目上，也可以看到我国古时科学的卓越。早在“尔雅”里就有关于啄木鸟的记载。尔雅释鸟说：“鴷，斫木。”疏：“口如锥，长数寸，常斫树食虫，因名云。”禽经里的注说：“斫木鸟，巢木中，嘴如鸡，长数寸，常斫食树蠹，喙振木，虫皆动也。”李时珍在本草纲目里汇集了前人的说法以后，又说：“啄木小者如雀，大者如鸦，面如桃花，喙足皆青色，刚爪，利嘴，嘴如锥，长数寸，舌长于嘴，其端有针刺，啄得蠹，以舌钩出食之。”这一些话都是从科学的观察得来，并且比之今天禽类学家关于啄木鸟类的说明也相差不多。此外，啄木鸟的双足很坚强，各有四趾，两个向前，两个向后（也有三趾的），便于它爬树和横站在树干上。它的尾羽坚韧，用来支撑和平衡它攀在树上的身躯。它在木中的巢，是一个自己斫成的洞，先从树皮通到树心，再向下通，可以容纳一窠五、六个又光又白的小蛋。啄木的种类很多，在河北一带“小者如雀”的有东陵树林里的“小啄木”、“花啄木”；“大者如鸦”的有“山啄木”，又名“火老鸦”。在北京一带终年可见的一种是“绿啄木”。
    啄木鸟的喙非常厉害。“异物志”说：啄木鸟“俗云雷公采药吏所化也”，这想必是从它的喙想起了雷公的尖嘴。欧洲人认为十分强硬的橡树，也照样被它啄通。所以欧洲的民间传说里有啄木鸟采取仙草根的故事，说啄木鸟衔着这种草根就会让树身上的洞启开。啄木鸟不愿意让用过的草根落到人的手里，要把它烧掉。因此人们用一块红布铺在树底下，哄啄木鸟是火，让草根落下来。人有了这种草根能够解脱锁链，启开宝藏。这故事见格林的德国童话。
    啄木鸟终年像击鼓似的，靠伐木以寻食树上的虫蚁和幼虫。它完全生活在树上，很少到地上来。格林在另一个普鲁士故事里说：在开天辟地的时候，各种鸟都依照神的吩咐去开凿河、海，只有啄木鸟嫌泥巴脏，不肯去。因此神后来罚它去啄树木，不许它去河边池上解渴，只能仰饮雨露。关于啄木鸟吃虫子的本领，博物志说：此鸟能以嘴画字，令虫自出。这也竭尽了想像的能事。
    美国加利福尼亚的一种啄木鸟，往往把一颗颗橡实紧嵌在树干上，树身上被嵌得满满的，远看好似钉满了光亮的铜钉。原来橡实壳里封有蛆虫，是它们储藏的粮食。
