Xinhua News Agency, Łódź, January 16th: The people of Łódź welcomed the Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai as if it were a festival on the 15th.

That afternoon, after attending a luncheon hosted by the Chairman of the Łódź People's Council, the Chinese guests traveled by car to the Sports Hall to attend a grand mass rally. The approximately five-kilometer-long avenue from the City Hall to the Sports Hall was packed with welcoming crowds. Twenty Chinese and Polish national flags fluttered from the top of the Sports Hall. A Chinese banner reading "Long Live the People's Republic of China!" was hung high above the entrance to the hall.

Premier Zhou Enlai and others, accompanied by Zambrowski, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, and Tatarkovna, First Secretary of the Łódź Municipal Committee, entered the hall. At this moment, a thunderous applause erupted in the venue. People shouted, "Long live Polish-Chinese friendship!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!", and sang the folk song "Sto Lat."

Kazimierczak, Chairman of the Łódź People's Council, announced the opening of the meeting. Comrade Zambrowski delivered a speech welcoming the Chinese guests.

Amid thunderous applause, cheers, and the singing of "Sto Lat," Premier Zhou Enlai stepped onto the stage and delivered a speech to more than 5,000 people in the hall. Premier Zhou praised Łódź's revolutionary tradition, mentioning that the first Polish workers' organization was born in Łódź seventy-five years ago, and the armed uprising of Łódź workers fifty-two years ago, and the tense fighting days of the Second World War. The whole audience erupted in increasingly loud applause, and the atmosphere was extremely warm.

After the mass rally ended, the Chinese guests left the venue in the singing of "Sto Lat." The Polish people usually use this folk song to express their warm feelings for their dearest friends and brothers.

The number of welcomers along the streets where Premier Zhou and others' cars passed increased. Where the cars passed, the trams stopped, and passengers jumped out of the trams to cheer the guests. Some shop assistants also suspended business and went to the front of the shop to welcome the guests. Nurses in white work clothes were also unwilling to miss this opportunity, and peered out of the windows to see the Chinese comrades.

The guests' cars stopped in front of an apartment building, where they would visit an ordinary family. Premier Zhou and others got out of the cars and walked into the building surrounded by people. A middle-aged housewife, Kajur, opened the door to welcome the guests. Suddenly, Kajur's two rooms were filled with friends from China. Her husband was teaching at school, and her two-year-old child, Milczek, stared at the guests in a daze. When Premier Zhou Enlai kindly stroked his little face, he grinned. Premier Zhou carefully inspected the interior furnishings and inquired about the living conditions of the hosts. Finally, Milczek obediently smiled and took a photo with Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and others while holding a doll.

After leaving the apartment building, the Chinese guests were immediately surrounded by people from all directions again. Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long occasionally threw the bouquets in their hands to the crowded people. A fifteen-year-old girl, Trlinska, squeezed hard to get in front of Premier Zhou and said that she hoped to take a flower from a Chinese friend home to give to her parents. She proudly accepted a bouquet of carnations from Premier Zhou and waved goodbye with a smile.

The delegation's cars traveled along the main streets, and there were endless streams of people waving to the guests on every street.

The Chinese guests arrived at the train station. Tens of thousands of people had already gathered in the square in front of the train station and on the platforms. Premier Zhou Enlai and others waved goodbye to the countless smiling faces. Finally, the train carrying the Chinese dignitaries slowly started to move amidst the singing of "Sto Lat," returning to Warsaw.

At 5:00 p.m. that day, the Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai returned to Warsaw from Łódź, ending its visit to major cities in Poland.

    波兰罗兹市举行盛会欢迎我代表团
    据新华社罗兹16日电　罗兹市人民15日像过节日一样地热烈欢迎以周恩来总理为首的中国政府代表团。
    这天下午，中国客人们在出席了罗兹市人民会议主席举行的午宴以后，乘汽车前往体育大厅参加盛大的群众集会。从市政府到体育大厅约五公里长的大街两旁都挤满了欢迎的人群。体育大厅顶端飘扬着二十面中波两国国旗。大厅门前高挂着“中华人民共和国万岁！”的中文标语。
    周恩来总理等在波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局委员萨姆布罗夫斯基、罗兹市委会第一书记塔塔科夫纳等同志陪同下走进大厅。这时，会场上爆发了一阵雷鸣般的掌声。人们高呼：“波中友谊万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”，高唱民歌“斯托—拉特”。
    罗兹市人民会议主席卡齐米尔恰克宣布大会开始。萨姆布罗夫斯基同志致词欢迎中国客人。
    周恩来总理在雷鸣般的掌声、欢呼声中和“斯托—拉特”的歌声中登上讲台，向大厅里的五千多人发表演说。周总理赞扬了罗兹的革命传统，他提到七十五年前在罗兹曾经诞生了波兰第一个工人组织，提到了五十二年前罗兹工人的武装起义和第二次世界大战中那些紧张战斗的日子。全场爆发出一阵比一阵响亮的掌声，气氛十分热烈。
    群众大会结束以后，中国客人在“斯托—拉特”的歌声中离开会场。波兰人通常就是用这支民歌来表达他们对最亲爱的朋友、兄弟的热烈情感。
    在周总理等乘坐的汽车所经过的街道两旁，欢迎者有增无减。在汽车路过的地方，行驶着的电车停了下来，乘客跳下电车向客人欢呼。有些商店的店员们也暂停营业，走到门前欢迎客人。穿着洁白工作服的护士们也不愿意放过这个机会，而从窗口探出头来看看中国同志。
    客人们的汽车在一幢公寓大楼前面停了下来，他们要在这里访问一个普通的家庭。周总理等下了汽车，在人们的簇拥下走进了大楼。一位中年的家庭主妇卡茹尔开门迎接客人。顿时，卡茹尔的两间房子中挤满了来自中国的友人。她的丈夫正在学校教书，她两岁的孩子小米尔切克出神地望着来宾。当周恩来总理亲切地摸抚他的小脸时，他就咧嘴笑了。周总理细致地参观了室内的陈设，询问了主人的生活情况。最后，小米尔切克抱着洋囡囡很听话地微笑着同周恩来总理、贺龙副总理等拍了一张照片。
    走出公寓大楼以后，中国客人们立刻又被人们从四面八方包围起来。周恩来总理、贺龙副总理不时把手中的花束抛向拥挤的人群。十五岁的女孩特林斯卡使劲地挤到周总理面前说，她希望带一枝从中国朋友手中得到的花回家送给爸爸妈妈。她得意地从周总理手中接过了一束康乃馨花，笑嘻嘻地招手而去。
    代表团的汽车沿着主要街道行进，条条大街上都有络绎不绝的人向客人招手。
    中国客人来到了火车站。在火车站前广场上和站台上，早已万人云集。周恩来总理等向那无数的笑脸挥手告别。最后，载着中国贵宾的火车在“斯托—拉特”的歌声中徐徐开动，返回华沙去。
    当天下午五时，以周恩来总理为首的中国政府代表团从罗兹回到华沙，结束了在波兰各大城市的访问。
