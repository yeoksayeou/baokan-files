Party Committee Leadership Is Not Just a "Formality"
	Kong Sang

Now, no one says they disagree with implementing the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee in enterprises. However, there are still people who, under various pretexts, doubt the leadership of the Party committee. For example, some people say: "Apart from the factory director, most members of the Party committee do not understand production operations. How can they conduct discussions and make decisions on major enterprise production issues?" The implication is that when discussing major production and business issues, the so-called collective leadership of the Party committee is merely a formality, just going through the motions.

At first glance, these words seem reasonable, but upon closer reflection, the logic is insufficient.

If we use the relationship between famous actors and the audience to compare the relationship between experts and non-experts: Famous actors are stage artists, and the audience is generally considered laypeople, but they are connoisseurs. An actor, in addition to constantly learning from experts in the field, must also listen to the opinions of the audience, study what kind of singing they like and dislike; what kind of movements and expressions they like and dislike, and constantly improve his acting skills based on the audience's preferences. Only over time can he become a good actor. Experts in all fields of work, in order to better serve the people, must also, like actors, constantly absorb some specific experiences from the vast number of non-experts to enrich themselves. Among the Party committee members in an enterprise, the factory director certainly understands and is more familiar with production management operations than other members, but just as actors can learn from the audience and experts can learn from non-experts, then why can't a factory director report his work at a Party committee meeting and listen to everyone's opinions? Even if, at the beginning, everyone is a layman and cannot offer more insightful opinions, the fact that the Party committee has made a decision on your report shows that your work and plan have the support of the Party, and it will be much smoother to implement.

Moreover, the relationship between the factory director and other Party committee members is not entirely the same as the relationship between actors and the audience, or experts and non-experts. Because: First, other Party committee members are not completely ignorant of enterprise production management operations; they simply know less than the factory director. Second, the Party committee does not discuss purely technical and business matters, but rather major issues of principle and policy. The opinions of other members on the Party's policies and principles should be valued; they are in contact with the masses and understand their emotions and demands. When the Party committee discusses major issues in production management, they will offer opinions from different perspectives, making the factory director's report more in line with the Party's policies and more in line with reality.

In short, from whatever perspective, the statement that "the Party committee does not understand business" and that "the collective leadership of the Party committee is just going through the motions" is incorrect. Naturally, when discussing production and business issues, the Party committee should listen more to the opinions of the factory director, because in this respect, the factory director is generally more familiar than other Party committee members.

    党委领导并非走“过场”
    孔桑
    现在已经没有人说不同意在企业里实行党委领导下的厂长负责制了。不过，借着这样那样的理由来怀疑党委的领导的人，则还是有的。例如有人说：“除厂长以外，党委的多数委员不懂生产业务，怎能就企业生产的重大问题开展讨论，作出决议呢？”意思是说：在讨论重大的生产业务问题的时候，所谓党委集体领导，还不是形式主义的走个“过场”而已。
    乍一听来，这些话好像是有道理的，但仔细想想，就觉得道理很不够了。
    如果我们用名演员同观众的关系来比喻专家同非专家的关系：名演员是舞台艺术家，观众一般说是外行，但是鉴赏家。一个演员，除了经常向本行的专家学习以外，还必须倾听观众的意见，研究他们喜爱什么样的唱腔，不喜爱什么样的唱腔；喜爱什么样的身段和表情，不喜爱什么样的身段和表情，不断地根据观众的喜爱来改进自己的演技，久而久之，才能成为一个好演员。各方面工作的专家要想更好地为人民服务，也要像演员一样，经常吸收广大非专家的某些具体经验，来丰富自己。在企业的党委成员中，厂长确实比其他委员更懂得和熟悉生产管理业务，但是，既然演员可以向观众学习，专家可以向非专家学习，那末，作为一个厂长为什么就不可以在党委会上报告自己的工作，听听大家的意见呢？即使在开始的时候，由于大家都是外行，提不出更高明的意见来，但党委既然就你的报告作出了决定，就说明你的工作和计划得到了党的支持，执行起来就要顺利得多。
    况且，厂长同其他党委委员的关系，并不完全跟演员同观众、专家同非专家的关系一样。因为：一、其他党委并非完全不懂得企业生产管理业务，只不过是比厂长懂得少一些而已；二、党委会所讨论的并不是纯粹的技术和业务，而是具有方针性、政策性的重大问题。对党的政策和方针，其他委员的意见是应该重视的，他们跟群众有联系，了解群众的情绪和要求。党委会讨论生产管理上重大问题的时候，他们会从不同的角度提出意见，使厂长提出的报告更符合于党的政策，更符合于实际。
    总之，不论从哪一点来说，所谓“党委不懂业务”，“党委集体领导只是走个‘过场’”的说法，都是不正确的。自然在讨论生产业务问题时，党委会应当多多听取厂长的意见，因为在这方面，一般说厂长比其它党委委员是更熟悉些的。
