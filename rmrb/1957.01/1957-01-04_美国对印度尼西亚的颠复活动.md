    U.S. Subversive Activities Against Indonesia

    Recent events within Indonesia have attracted attention. Following three failed coup attempts by former Deputy Army Chief of Staff Lubis, former First Military Region Commander Simbolon launched a military rebellion in North Sumatra. The purpose of these coup plots was to overthrow the Sastroamidjojo government by force and change the government's foreign policy of peaceful neutrality. Clearly, these rebellious activities seriously endangered Indonesia's national security and unity and were fundamentally incompatible with Indonesia's national interests. Precisely because of this, the Lubis-Simbolon group's conspiracy was opposed by Indonesia's patriotic forces and declared bankrupt. This is a victory for the Indonesian government and people.

    However, the anti-government conspiracy fabricated by the Lubis-Simbolon group is not a purely domestic issue. According to facts revealed by Indonesian newspapers, it has been fully proven that imperialists stand behind this group, and the United States is one of the masterminds pulling the strings. In mid-September last year, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director Allen Dulles visited Jakarta, held talks with Lubis, and gave Lubis millions of dollars in funding. After this, Lubis's anti-government activities unfolded intensely. What is thought-provoking is that on November 15th and 16th, when Lubis launched his third coup, the U.S. embassy staff remained in their offices and residences all day. Similarly, American activity was also discovered before the Simbolon incident. A plane belonging to U.S. veteran officer Chennault suddenly landed in North Sumatra. The people on the plane promised aid to Simbolon on the condition of protecting American oil interests in North Sumatra, at least to the same extent as guaranteeing Dutch oil interests. After the Simbolon incident, the U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, during a visit to Indonesian government officials, openly stated that the United States might consider recognizing the Simbolon regime. Indonesian public opinion pointed out that all of this is a blatant interference in Indonesia's internal affairs by the United States, and the United States is attempting to use such means to change the political situation in Indonesia.

    Since Indonesia's independence, the United States has been hostile to this young republic. Especially after the general election last September, the growth of democratic and patriotic forces in Indonesia greatly shocked the United States. It openly clamored for "resolute efforts" to "save the Indonesian situation." Since then, the United States has intensified its subversive activities against Indonesia. It uses so-called private foundations such as the "Asia Foundation" to assist certain groups in conspiracies to overthrow the government. Now it is even supporting anti-government armed rebellions. This is the "friendship" that the United States touts towards Asian and African countries!

    From these events, the patriotic people of Indonesia have more clearly seen who their enemies are. We believe that the Indonesian people will unite to defeat all colonialist conspiracies, safeguard national independence and national unity, and enable their country to continue to move forward along the path of independent development.

### 美国对印度尼西亚的颠复活动

    美国对印度尼西亚的颠复活动
    最近在印度尼西亚国内发生的一些事件，引起了人们的注意。在前陆军副参谋长卢比斯三次阴谋政变失败之后，前第一军区司令西姆波朗又在北苏门答腊发动军事叛乱。这些政变阴谋的目的，都是想用武力推翻沙斯特罗阿米佐约政府，并改变政府所执行的和平中立的外交政策。很显然，这些叛乱活动严重地危害了印度尼西亚国家的安全和统一，同印度尼西亚的民族利益是根本不相容的。正是因为这样，卢比斯—西姆波朗集团的阴谋计划遭到了印度尼西亚爱国力量的反对而宣告破产了。这是印度尼西亚政府和人民的一个胜利。
    但是，卢比斯—西姆波朗集团所制造的反政府阴谋，并不是单纯的国内问题。根据印度尼西亚报纸所揭露的事实，已经完全证明，在这个集团的背后站着帝国主义者，而美国就是这个集团的幕后拉线人之一。去年9月中旬，美国中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯就曾到雅加达活动，和卢比斯举行会谈，并给了卢比斯几百万美元的经费。在这以后，卢比斯的反政府活动就紧张地展开了。耐人寻味的是：在卢比斯第三次发动政变的11月15、16两天，美国大使馆的人员反常地整天没有一个人离开办公室和住宅。同样的，在西姆波朗事件发生前，也发现有美国的活动。一架属于美国退伍军官陈纳德的飞机突然在北苏门答腊降落。坐这架飞机到那里去的人答应援助西姆波朗，条件是保障美国在北苏门答腊的石油利益，最低限度同保障荷兰的石油利益一样。西姆波朗事件发生后，美国驻印度尼西亚大使在拜会印度尼西亚政府人士时，更公然表示美国可能考虑承认西姆波朗的政权。印度尼西亚舆论指出，所有这些是美国对印度尼西亚内政的粗暴干涉，美国就是企图利用这种手段来改变印度尼西亚的政治局势。
    自从印度尼西亚独立以来，美国就敌视这个年轻的共和国。特别是去年9月普选以后，印度尼西亚民主力量和爱国力量的增长使美国大为震惊。它公然叫嚷“必须作出坚决的努力”来“挽救印度尼西亚的局势”。从此以后，美国就加紧了它对印度尼西亚的颠复活动。它利用所谓“亚洲基金会”等等私人的基金会援助某些集团来进行推翻政府的阴谋。现在它竟又支持反政府的武装叛乱。这就是美国高唱的对亚非国家的“友谊”！
    印度尼西亚的爱国人民从这些事件中已经更清楚地看到谁是他们的敌人。我们相信印度尼西亚人民必将团结起来击败一切殖民主义的阴谋活动，维护民族的独立和国家的统一，使自己的国家能够沿着独立发展的道路继续前进。
