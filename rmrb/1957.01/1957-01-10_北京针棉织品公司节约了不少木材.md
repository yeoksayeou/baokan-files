    Beijing Knitwear and Cotton Goods Company Saves a Lot of Timber
    Since the Beijing Knitwear and Cotton Goods Company implemented the method of unified management and centralized use of old packaging materials in the fourth quarter of 1954, it has saved the country a lot of timber. The company's packaging material management department often repairs used old wooden boxes for reuse; old wooden boxes that can no longer be used are dismantled into planks, sorted by length, and then processed into various wooden boxes for use. In this way, old box planks can generally be used two to three times. They once processed more than 30,000 wooden boxes for soap from small short planks (twelve inches to eighteen inches long) that were originally intended to be sold as firewood, saving more than 3,000 yuan in packaging costs. In 1955, they used old box planks to process 96,000 wooden boxes, which, calculated at 50 wooden boxes made from one cubic meter of raw wood, saved the country 1,920 cubic meters of timber. The company has also saved the country a lot of timber by improving the packaging of goods. Before 1954, cotton textiles were all packaged in wooden boxes, but later they switched to using cardboard boxes and burlap sacks. From 1955 to the present, using cardboard boxes instead of wooden boxes has saved more than 1,600 cubic meters of timber.　Sun Xingkui

    北京针棉织品公司节约了不少木材
    北京市针棉织品公司，自1954年第四季度实行了统一管理、集中使用旧包装用品的办法以后，已给国家节约了许多木材。该公司的包装用品管理部门，经常把已用过的旧木箱加以修理后再用；把不能再用的旧木箱拆成木板，按长短分类，以后再加工成各种木箱使用。这样，旧箱板一般能使用二至三次。他们曾把准备当劈柴出售的小短板（十二英吋至十八英吋长），加工成三万多只装肥皂的木箱，节省包装费三千多元。在1955年，曾利用旧箱板加工成木箱九万六千只，按每立方公尺元木制成五十只木箱计算，就给国家节约木材一千九百二十立方公尺。该公司在改进商品包装上，也给国家节省不少木材。在1954年以前，属于棉织品的商品，均用木箱包装，后来他们就改用纸箱、麻包皮包装。自1955年到现在，因用纸箱代替木箱，就节约木材一千六百多立方公尺。　孙兴魁
