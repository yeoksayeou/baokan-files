Pig down, which in the past was mostly used for fertilizing fields, can actually be mixed with cotton or ramie fibers to spin yarn for knitting sweaters and blankets.

The pig bristle factory affiliated with the Fuyang Prefectural Administrative Office's Agricultural Products Purchasing Bureau in Anhui Province successfully test-spun yarn in the fourth quarter of last year, based on the suggestion of pig bristle technician Zhang Guanzhu. The mixed yarn they spun using 80% pig down and 20% ramie, or 75% pig down and 25% cotton, had the same tensile strength as hand-spun wool from the Northwest, although the yarn count was slightly thicker. The yarn mixed with ramie and pig down also had a luster. Its cost is very low.

Pig down is the fine, soft downy hair on pigs, a byproduct of processing pig bristles. The Wuhu Pig Bristle Processing Factory has successfully used it in trial production of quilts. (Xinhua News Agency)

    用猪绒纺毛线
    过去大部分用以肥田的猪绒，其实可以同棉纤维或苎麻纤维混合纺成毛线，用来编织毛衣、毛毯。
    安徽省阜阳专署农产品采购局所属的猪鬃工厂，根据猪鬃技术员张贯珠的建议，去年第四季度就试纺成功了。他们用80％的猪绒和20％的苎麻，或者用75％的猪绒和25％的棉花纺出的混合毛线，同西北出产的手纺毛线相比，拉力一样，线支稍为粗一些，用麻和猪绒混纺的毛线还有光泽。它的成本很低。
    猪绒是猪身上的细软绒毛，是加工猪鬃的一种副产品。芜湖猪鬃加工厂曾成功地用它试作过被胎。　（新华社）
