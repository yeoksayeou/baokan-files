    On "Procedures"
    Xiao Su
    When handling a matter, one often has to go through certain procedures. Some procedures are necessary. For example, when going to a hospital to see a doctor, one must first register. If this registration procedure is eliminated, and all patients rush directly into the consultation room, it will make it impossible for the doctor to work. However, procedures are not laws set by God, but conceived by people. It would be very worrying if someone thought that as long as a set of procedures is established, everything will be fine, or that the more complicated the procedures, the better the work will be. Unfortunately, such examples are everywhere.
    Let's start with eating. There are two soy milk shops in Dongdan and Wangfujing where I often go for breakfast. In the past, when you went to drink soy milk, you sat down inside and called out, and someone would bring the soy milk. Now that's not possible. To have breakfast, you have to queue up to pay and get a ticket, and the line often stretches from the cashier's desk to the street. See, to have breakfast, you have to be so stressed!
    The unreasonable nature of procedures causes even greater harm in work. In an article published in the People's Daily not long ago, the director of a factory described procedures as follows: In his factory, "...if a worker proposes a rationalization suggestion or a measure needs to be taken in production, or a Soviet expert makes a suggestion, and if the required cost is more than 200 yuan and is not included in the annual plan, then according to the current system, the handling procedure will be like this: workshop review, process section review, transfer to the planning section, transfer to the construction section, application to add a construction plan, bureau approval, construction section transfers to the planning section, issues a manufacturing order, the manufacturing unit receives materials, manufactures, completes and cancels the order, and then receives the item. There are a total of twelve major procedures and dozens of minor procedures. What about the cycle? According to convention, it takes two months, not counting manufacturing time. If something goes wrong in the middle, then who knows how long it will take." Imagine, under the obstruction of these dozen or so major and minor procedures, where can employees go to unleash their creativity and enthusiasm?
    There are even more astonishing miracles than the above. According to the China Youth Daily, it takes 321 stamps on 27 documents from start to finish to process a set of cotton clothes at the Wangfujing Department Store of the Beijing Department Store Company! A cartoon published in the newspaper tells people: if these hundreds of stamps were printed on the fabric needed for this set of clothes, it would become a quite impressive printed fabric.
    I have no doubt that some people, when studying and formulating various work procedures, have good intentions, aiming to eliminate loopholes and losses that may occur in the work, and to do the work better; but due to inadequate consideration, they have neglected the harm that these procedures may bring. However, there are indeed others who, with the intention of "once and for all," attempt to use a set of complicated procedures to replace the detailed, laborious, but necessary political and economic work; when stipulating procedures, they only care about their own convenience, not the convenience of others, only seeking their own leisure and ease, regardless of the suffering of the masses.
    Excessive, bureaucratic procedures often conceal distrust of people, laziness and selfishness, and extravagant and luxurious habits.
    To eliminate the scourge of rampant procedures, we must first start by reforming the work system; and to reform the system, what should be respected first should not be commodities, official documents, facades, pomp and circumstance, and the convenience of individuals and small collectives, but those who implement the system and perform the procedures, those millions of ordinary people who are affected by these systems and procedures every day and every hour.
    Setting aside the needs and convenience of thousands upon thousands of people, setting aside their self-esteem and enthusiasm, and talking about systems and procedures, still wanting to do a good job, is truly like climbing a tree to catch a fish, and the distance from the goal will naturally become farther and farther.

### 谈“手续”

    谈“手续”
    萧溯
    办理一件事情，常得履行一定的手续。有些手续是必要的。比如去医院看病得先挂号，如果取消挂号这手续，让所有的病人都直接往诊疗室里涌去，那就会使医生无法工作了。但是，手续不是上帝定出来的律条，而是人想出来的。如果有人以为只要定出了一套手续，就万事大吉，以为手续越繁多，工作就会越好，那就很值得担忧了。不幸的是，这样的例子却是到处都有。
    先从吃饭方面说吧。东单和王府井有两家豆浆馆，是我常去吃早点的地方。从前，去喝浆，到屋里坐下，叫一声，就有人把浆端上来。现在可不行了。吃早点得先排队办理交钱领牌的手续，队伍往往从账桌前排到街上。你看，要吃早点，就得这么紧张！
    手续的不合理，在工作上造成的弊害更要大。某工厂厂长不久前在人民日报上发表的一篇文章里，有这么一段关于手续的描述：在他的工厂里，“……如果工人提出一件合理化建议或生产中需要采取一项措施，或是苏联专家提出一项建议，假定其所需费用在二百元以上，而年度计划又未列入，那么这件事情按照现行制度的规定，其处理程序将是这样：车间审查、工艺科审查、转计划科、转基建科、申请追加基建计划、局批、基建科转计划科、下制造令、承制单位领料、制造、完工销令、领用，共是十二道大手续，几十道小手续；其周期呢？按照惯例，不算制造时间也得两个月，如果当中出点岔子，那就不知道要多久了。”试想，在这十多道大手续、小手续的阻击之下，叫职工上那里去发挥创造性和积极性呢？
    还有比上面的事情更惊人的奇迹呢。据中国青年报载，北京市百货公司王府井百货商店加工一套棉衣，从开始到完成要在二十七张单据上打上三百二十一个图章！报上刊载的一张漫画告诉人们：如果把这三百几十个图章印在这套衣服所需的布料上，就成了一幅相当可观的印花布了。
    我毫不怀疑有些人在研究制定各种各样工作手续的时候，心肠是好的，是为了杜绝工作中可能发生的漏洞和损失，是为了把工作做得更好；只是由于考虑不周，忽视了这些手续可能带来的弊害。但是，也的确还有另一些人，他们抱着“一劳永逸”的打算，企图用一套繁杂的手续，来代替细致的、费力气的、但却是必要的政治工作和经济工作；他们在规定手续的时候，只顾自己方便，不与人方便，只图自己清闲省事，不管广大群众受折磨。
    过多的、繁文缛节的手续往往掩盖着对于人的不信任，掩盖着懒惰和自私，掩盖着铺张和骄奢的习气。
    要消灭手续泛滥的弊害，须先从改革工作制度始；而要改革制度，首先要尊重的，不应该是商品、公文、门面、排场以及个人和小集体的方便，而应该是那些执行制度、履行手续的人，是那些每天每时受这些制度和手续影响的千百万普通人。
    撇开千千万万人的需要和方便、撇开他们的自尊心和积极性，而谈制度和手续，还想把工作做好，那真如同缘木而求鱼，距离目的自然越来越远了。
