Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 11th: At a National Unity Front (formerly translated as "National United Front") election meeting in Warsaw's Third District attended by thousands of voters on January 9th, Polish United Workers' Party First Secretary Gomulka delivered a speech and answered many questions raised by voters.

Gomulka said that although there had been errors in economic policy, Poland's industrial and agricultural production had continued to grow over the past twelve years. Comparing the average per capita output of several major products in 1955 with 1938, steel increased from an average of 43 kg per person to 162 kg, coal from 1,054 kg to 3,463 kg, electricity from 106 kWh to 651 kWh, cotton fabrics from 9 meters to 21 meters, sugar from 15 kg to 36 kg, grain from 388 kg to 464 kg, and meat from 24.2 kg to 45 kg. Gomulka emphasized that these increasing figures convincingly demonstrated the superiority of the socialist economic system.

Gomulka analyzed the causes of Poland's current economic difficulties: the imbalance between the speed of industrialization and the supply of raw materials, the imbalance between industrial and agricultural development; too rapid wage increases last year (especially in the second half), far exceeding planned figures; the failure of certain economic sectors to complete plans for increasing labor productivity; and a trade deficit. He pointed out that these difficulties were difficulties encountered in advancement. All criticism should be constructive and should not negate everything from the past. He went on to say that the Party and the government were making every effort to overcome economic difficulties and improve the living standards of the working people. However, overcoming difficulties was the common task of the Party, the government, and all working people, and the way to further improve the living standards of the urban and rural working people was to produce more, save more, and do better.

When discussing the issue of accepting foreign loans, Gomulka said that Poland only accepts loans that do not have any political conditions attached. He said that foreign aid was secondary, and the main thing was to rely on ourselves. The people's government would never exchange national sovereignty for Western assistance.

Regarding the path and conditions for building socialism, he said that in essence, there is only one socialism. We should always remember that although countries have different conditions for building socialism, there are also common, consistent, and essential conditions. One of these is the leadership of socialist construction by the working class's Marxist-Leninist party.

He said that the new policy on handicrafts was not temporary, and if the socialist economy did not yet have the strength to take over and operate small-scale capitalist factories, then preserving them was in the interests of socialism.

Speaking of the future work of the parliament, Gomulka said that our party had pointed out that it was necessary to amend the provisions in the constitution regarding the parliament's right to supervise the activities of the government and state organs, by restoring the activities of the Supreme Audit Office under the parliament. Making some other amendments to the constitution would also be meaningful and beneficial.

Gomulka said that parliamentary candidates were selected by the election committee from candidates proposed by various gatherings, organizations, and people from all walks of life. Each party campaigned for the candidates it considered the best.

Gomulka asked voters to support the candidates of the National Unity Front. He said that the various parties participating in this election had put their candidates on a common electoral list. Each party had done its best to put its best people on the list first. These parties should be trusted. These parties determined the order of candidates through mutual understanding.

He also asked members of the Polish United Workers' Party and all those who sympathized with the Party to support the candidates of the Polish United Workers' Party. He emphasized that the Polish United Workers' Party had always played a leading role in people's Poland. He said, "We are the party of the working class, the party of the urban and rural working people, the party of people's Poland. No one can serve the working masses and people's Poland more loyally than we can. No one has suffered more for the cause of the working people than the thousands of most loyal members of our party. They should be trusted. Building socialism is not easy, and the Polish people will continue to advance along the path guided by the Polish United Workers' Party."

    在全国统一阵线华沙第三区选民集会上
    哥穆尔卡号召支持全国阵线候选人
    新华社华沙11日电　波兰统一工人党第一书记哥穆尔卡9日在全国统一阵线（即“全国阵线”，前译“民族统一阵线”）华沙第三区数千选民的集会上发表演说，回答了选民所提出的许多问题。
    哥穆尔卡说，虽然在经济政策上曾经有过错误，但是，在过去十二年中波兰的工农业生产还是不断地增长。拿1955年几种主要产品按人口平均的产量来同1938年比较，钢从平均每人四十三公斤增加到一百六十二公斤，煤从一千零五十四公斤增加到三千四百六十三公斤，电力从一百零六度增加到六百五十一度，棉织品从九公尺增加到二十一公尺，糖从十五公斤增加到三十六公斤，谷物从三百八十八公斤增加到四百六十四公斤，肉类从二十四点二公斤增加到四十五公斤。哥穆尔卡强调指出，这些增长的数字令人信服地表明了社会主义经济制度的优越性。
    哥穆尔卡分析波兰目前经济困难产生的原因是：工业化的速度同原料供应之间的不平衡，工业同农业发展之间的不平衡；去年（特别是下半年）工资增加太快，远远超过计划数字；某些经济部门没有完成提高劳动生产率的计划；以及对外贸易的入超。他指出，这种困难是前进中的困难。一切批评都应当是建设性的，不能抹煞过去的一切。他接着说，党和政府正在尽一切努力来克服经济困难、提高劳动人民生活水平。但是，克服困难是党、政府和全体劳动人民的共同任务，进一步提高城乡劳动人民生活水平的道路就是生产得更多、更省、更好。
    哥穆尔卡在谈到接受外国贷款问题的时候说，波兰只接受不附带任何政治条件的贷款。他说，外援是次要的，主要的是依靠自己。人民政权决不会用国家主权来换取西方的援助。
    关于建设社会主义的道路和条件的问题，他说，实质上社会主义只有一个。我们应当永远记住，尽管各国建设社会主义有着不同的条件，但是也有着共同的、一致的、必须具备的条件。其中之一就是由工人阶级的马克思列宁主义政党来领导社会主义建设。
    他说，手工业的新政策不是临时的，如果社会主义经济还没有力量来接管和经营小规模的资本主义工厂，那么保存它们是符合社会主义利益的。
    谈到未来议会的工作，哥穆尔卡说，我们的党已经指出，需要修改宪法中关于议会对政府和国家机关活动的监督权的规定，办法是恢复议会所属的最高监察院的活动。对宪法作一些其他修正也会是有意义和有益的。
    哥穆尔卡说，议会议员候选人都是由选举委员会从各种集会、组织和各界人士所提出的候选人当中选拔出来的。每个党为它所认为最好的候选人进行了竞选。
    哥穆尔卡要求选民支持全国统一阵线的候选人。他说，参加这次选举的各个政党，都把它们的候选人列在一个共同的选举名单上。每个政党都已经尽力首先把它的最优秀的人列在名单上。应该信任这些政党。这些政党在共同谅解下，确定了候选人的名次。
    他还要求波兰统一工人党党员和同情党的一切人们支持波兰统一工人党的候选人。他强调指出，波兰统一工人党过去一直在人民的波兰起着领导作用。他说，我们是工人阶级的政党，是城乡劳动人民的政党，是人民波兰的政党。没有人能够比我们更加忠诚地为劳动群众和人民的波兰服务。没有人为了劳动人民的事业比我党成千上万的最忠诚的党员受过更多的苦。应该信任他们。建设社会主义是不容易的，波兰人民将继续沿着波兰统一工人党所指引的道路前进。
