    More Actively Offer Criticism and Suggestions
    In July of last year, I wrote a piece criticizing the autumn gabardine produced by the Guangzhou Yongyan Dyeing and Weaving Factory for its poor quality. Clothes made from it would tear after only three days of wear. After receiving the piece, the People's Daily forwarded it to the Ministry of Textile Industry, which in turn forwarded it to the Guangzhou Textile Products Company. The company immediately sent personnel to conduct an inspection, which proved that the poor quality was indeed the case. The factory was asked to make a self-criticism and assume responsibility for compensation, and was also instructed to guarantee product quality in the future. I was overjoyed after receiving a reply on December 10th. Although this piece was not published, it did a good thing for consumers and for the people. In the future, I will more actively offer criticism and suggestions.

    更积极地提出批评建议
    去年7月间我写了一篇稿，批评广州市永艳染织厂出的秋薄呢质量不高，做了衣服穿不上三天就破了。人民日报接到这篇稿子就转给纺织工业部，纺织工业部转到广州市纺织品公司，公司随即派员进行检查，证明产品质量不高情况完全属实，并要这个厂作了检讨和负起赔偿责任，还责成这个厂今后要保证产品质量。我在12月10日接到回信后，感到很大的喜悦。这篇稿虽然没有刊登，却为消费者，为人民做了一件好事。今后我要更积极地提出批评建议。
