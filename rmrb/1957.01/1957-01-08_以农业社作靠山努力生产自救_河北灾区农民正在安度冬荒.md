Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 7th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Hua reports: Members of agricultural cooperatives in areas of Hebei Province that suffered floods last year are spending the winter famine peacefully. Because cooperatives have played a huge role in production and disaster relief, a new situation of no famine during the winter famine has emerged in the disaster areas.

According to statistics from the Hebei Provincial Production and Disaster Relief Committee, more than 4.5 million laborers in the disaster areas of Hebei Province are currently engaged in more than 100 kinds of sideline production. As of the end of last month, the income from sideline production for disaster victims has reached more than 113 million yuan. In Raoyang County, a heavily affected area, the income from organizing members to engage in sideline production by various agricultural cooperatives, plus the state's disaster relief funds, has completely solved the need for 24 million jin of winter famine rations and livestock feed for the county's 180,000 disaster victims. Cooperatives with better sideline production have also stored some grain for the spring famine. According to investigations by the Raoyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the current living standards of general cooperative members throughout the county have remained at pre-disaster levels.

Because agricultural cooperatives use labor in a unified manner, winter agricultural production activities have not been affected by the disaster. Agricultural cooperatives in disaster areas have adopted methods such as using strong laborers for agriculture, women, the elderly, and the weak for sideline production, going to the fields for production during the day, and developing sideline production in the evening. After completing the sowing of more than 30 million mu of wheat, they also winter-plowed most of the arable land, creating conditions for shortening the disaster period and overcoming the famine. At the same time, agricultural cooperatives in disaster areas have also drawn more than 400,000 laborers, and under the leadership and support of the state, completed more than 20 million cubic meters of dyke restoration and flood control projects, preparing for this year's agricultural production increase. Agricultural cooperatives in heavily affected areas have also drawn labor to make adobe bricks and organized members to help build more than 900,000 new houses for members.

According to inspections in various places, since the beginning of winter, there have been no phenomena of fleeing famine, begging for food, selling children, or people freezing and starving to death. Before liberation, in 1939, Xinquiao Village in Wen'an County suffered a flood. Of the village's more than 540 households, more than 320 fled the famine, and ten people froze and starved to death. Now, the agricultural cooperative has organized more than 1,800 male and female laborers to engage in sideline production, with a daily income of more than 500 yuan, which not only solves the difficulties of food and clothing during the winter famine for the entire village, but also leaves some to support spring agricultural production.

### 以农业社作靠山努力生产自救  河北灾区农民正在安度冬荒

    以农业社作靠山努力生产自救
    河北灾区农民正在安度冬荒
    新华社保定7日电　新华社记者张华报道：河北省去年遭受水灾地区的农业社社员们正在安度冬荒。由于合作社在生产救灾上发挥了巨大的优越性，灾区出现了冬荒不荒的新局面。
    据河北省生产救灾委员会统计，现在河北省灾区有四百五十多万劳动力开展着一百多种副业生产。截至上月底，灾民的副业收入已达一亿一千三百多万元。重灾区饶阳县各农业社组织社员开展副业生产的收入，再加上国家的赈济款，全县十八万灾民需要的两千四百万斤冬荒口粮和牲口饲料已经全部解决。副业生产较好的社，还存下了一些度春荒的粮食。据中共饶阳县委调查了解，目前全县一般社员都保持了灾前的生活水平。
    由于农业社统一使用劳力，冬季的农业生产活动也没因灾受到影响。灾区农业社采用壮劳力搞农业，妇女老弱搞副业，白天下地生产，晚上开展副业等办法，在完成了三千多万亩小麦的播种工作后，并且冬耕了大部分能耕的白地，给缩短灾期度过灾荒创造了条件。同时，灾区农业社还抽出四十多万个劳力，在国家的领导扶持下完成了两千多万立方公尺的复堤防洪工程，为保障今年农业增产作了准备。重灾区的农业社还抽出劳力打坯和组织社员帮工，帮助社员修盖好九十多万间新房。
    根据各地检查，入冬以来没有发生逃荒讨饭、卖儿卖女、冻饿死人的现象。文安县新桥村解放前1939年遭受水灾后，全村五百四十多户中，有三百二十多户外出逃荒，十人冻饿而亡。现在农业社组织一千八百多名男女劳力从事副业生产，每天收入五百多元，不仅解决了全村冬荒中的吃穿困难，还能剩下一些支持春耕生产。
