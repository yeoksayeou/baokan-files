Discussion on the Object of Adjustment in Civil Law
    Qi Meng

    In recent years, debates have arisen in civil law teaching in political and legal institutions in our country and in civil legislation work regarding whether the property relations adjusted by civil law belong to the economic base or the superstructure. The essence of this question is how the law, as one of the superstructures, affects the actual life of the people. If this problem cannot be resolved well and correctly, there will be no unified and correct interpretation in civil law teaching, which will affect the establishment of a complete and accurate civil law science in our country, and will also affect our country's ongoing civil law-making in accurately reflecting the actual life of our people. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to carry out discussions on this issue in our country at present.

    The "Political and Legal Research" magazine published six articles on this issue in its second, third, and fifth issues of 1956. Subsequently, the editorial department of the magazine organized two symposiums on this issue. The discussion of this issue aroused great interest and attention from comrades in relevant units.

    At the beginning of the discussion, most people looked for arguments about property relations in Marxist-Leninist classic works and Soviet jurisprudence works, and elaborated on them. Because everyone's understanding was not exactly the same, there were both consistent and different aspects in their application and development. The common ground was that everyone believed that civil law is a component of the law of the superstructure, and it adjusts certain social relations. Everyone also agreed that in socialist society, civil law mainly adjusts the property relations between socialist organizations, between socialist organizations and citizens, and between citizens (civil law also adjusts personal non-property relations related to property relations, such as copyright, etc.). This kind of property relation is generated by ownership and is related to the function of the law of value and the law of distribution according to work. The difference lies in the nature of property relations, whether they belong to the scope of the superstructure or the base, there are the following two different opinions.

    One opinion is that the main object adjusted by our country's civil law—property relations—is generated by ownership and is related to product distribution. Property relations should belong to the category of production relations, and this kind of property relation is not controlled by people's will or consciousness, it exists objectively, and it is a social material relation that develops according to its own laws. Since it is a social material relation and a production relation, it should be included in the economic base.

    Another opinion is that the object adjusted by civil law—property relations—is the legal manifestation of production relations, and since it is a legal manifestation, it should be the civil legal relations that constitute the norms of civil law, which belong to the category of law. The formation process of civil legal relations is controlled by the will or consciousness of both parties, therefore, it is also a social ideological relation. Since it belongs to the category of law and is a social ideological relation, it should belong to the scope of the superstructure.

    These two different opinions have three intersections in the debate. First, there are different understandings of ideological relations. The first opinion believes that ideological relations are social relations formed through the function of social consciousness; the second opinion believes that ideological relations are social relations formed through the function of the will of both parties. The reason for this intersection is mainly because comrades holding the second opinion believe that the formation process of civil legal relations is determined by the will of the parties in the same way as the formation process of ideological relations, so civil legal relations belong to social ideological relations; and the object of adjustment of civil law, property relations, is civil legal relations, so this kind of property relation belongs to ideological relations. Comrades holding the first opinion, on the other hand, want to use the fact that the formation of social ideological relations is through social consciousness to explain that the second opinion misunderstands social ideological relations, and refute the theoretical basis of the second opinion.

    Second, there are different understandings of the meaning of "adjustment." The first opinion believes that "adjustment" means "regulation" (that is, it has the functions of confirmation, consolidation, development, restriction, suppression, and elimination). The law can play a regulatory role in production relations, that is, play an adjustment role, in the same direction as economic laws; the second opinion believes that "adjustment" means "determination." Since the law cannot determine production relations, it cannot adjust production relations either.

    Third, there are different understandings of civil legal relations. The first opinion believes that legal relations are the specific implementation of civil law norms and are consistent with civil law. Law is a tool of class struggle, and civil law is a department of law. Therefore, civil legal relations are a tool, not the object of adjustment; the second opinion believes that the main content of civil legal relations is the rights and obligations of the parties, and civil law is precisely adjusting these rights and obligations. Therefore, civil legal relations are the object of adjustment. Here, the second opinion wants to explain that civil legal relations are the object of adjustment by saying that civil legal relations are independent of civil law norms; the first opinion, on the contrary, believes that civil legal relations are consistent with civil law norms, and legal relations are legal norms being specifically realized, that is, the result of legal norms adjusting social relations. Therefore, civil legal relations are not the object of adjustment by civil law.

    In addition, the first opinion believes that the economic content of property relations is the real form of property relations, that is, production relations; the legal garb of property relations is property legal relations, that is, the legal form that embodies property relations is civil legal relations. Legal relations are a special manifestation of social relations. Legal relations depend on legal norms, and legal norms adjust economic content through legal relations. The second opinion believes that property relations are the legal manifestation of production relations, are the civil legal relations that constitute civil law norms, and can be independent of civil law norms, therefore, they are adjusted by civil law.

    After the discussion unfolded, the issues involved were wider and deeper. Both sides of the debate not only cited new arguments from the recent Soviet jurisprudence circles, such as arguments on the relationship between legal relations and legal norms, but also began to touch on some practical issues in our country's real life, such as making some different specific analyses of adjustment, legal relations, etc. The intersection of the debate is also more concise and practical than at the beginning of the discussion, so recently it has focused on a major issue, that is, how civil law, as one of the superstructures, reacts to the economic base, that is, whether civil law directly acts on the economic base or indirectly acts on the economic base. There are two opinions on this issue.

    The first opinion is that civil law directly reacts to the economic base. But here there are also two somewhat divergent views.

    One is that civil law adjusts property relations (that is, production relations) through civil legal relations (that is, civil law in implementation), in other words, civil law directly reacts to the economic base through specific implementation to adjust production relations.

    They depict this process in this way. The property relations adjusted by civil law are the property relations that occur between people according to their own economic, cultural, and other needs. If this relationship complies with the provisions of civil law, civil law confirms the rights and obligations of the parties (that is, civil law puts on the garb of civil legal relations on this kind of property relation), and civil law uses the coercive power of the state to guarantee the realization of rights and the performance of obligations. If one party fails to perform its obligations and damages the legitimate rights of the other party, civil law intervenes and makes it bear certain civil liabilities; if the property relations that occur between people do not comply with the provisions of civil law, civil law does not confirm the rights and obligations of the parties and gives certain sanctions. As Engels pointed out in "Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy," "The function of civil law is essentially to recognize the normal economic relations that each individual has with each other under certain circumstances." The economic relations mentioned here are property relations. Civil law puts on the garb of civil legal relations on this kind of property relation. Civil law is precisely through this kind of civil legal relation (the legal form of property relations) that it adjusts property relations and directly reacts to the economic base.

    One is that civil law directly reacts to the economic base by constraining people's behavior.

    They depict this process in this way: In order to live, people must engage in production activities, and these activities cause production relations to be constantly updated. Civil law plays an adjustment role in this constantly updated process. Civil law is a rule of conduct guaranteed by the state's coercive power, and it can constrain people's behavior by stipulating rights and obligations or prohibitions, so as to realize the economic requirements of the ruling class, consolidate and develop production relations that are beneficial to the ruling class, and restrict and eliminate production relations that are not beneficial to the ruling class. Therefore, civil law directly reacts to the economic base by constraining the behavior of the parties.

    The second opinion is that civil law adjusts civil legal relations and indirectly acts on the economic base.

    They depict this process in this way. They believe that property relations are civil legal relations and also ideological relations because they are social relations formed through the will of the parties. For example, taking the buying and selling relationship, it must be through the will of both parties expressing willingness to buy and sell before it can occur, and before the civil legal relations of the rights and obligations of the parties can be formed. Civil law influences ownership relations, exchange relations, etc., by adjusting this kind of civil legal relation (such as adjusting ownership relations, buying and selling relations, etc.). Civil law influences the economic base by adjusting civil legal relations (that is, property relations), that is, by the state stipulating and protecting civil legal relations.

    Those who believe that civil law directly reacts to the economic base believe that the above description is logically untenable. To admit that civil law adjusts civil legal relations is equivalent to saying that civil law adjusts civil law itself. This underestimates the role of civil law in the economic base.

    Judging from the discussion situation at this stage, everyone focuses more on the nouns and concepts in Marxist-Leninist classic works, and less on specific analysis based on our country's actual situation. Therefore, in order to make this discussion achieve good results, it is necessary to combine Marxist-Leninist theories related to civil law with our country's specific actual situation for specific analysis.

    关于民法调整对象的讨论
    齐萌
    近年来，在我国政法院校民法教学中和在民事立法工作中，都发生过对民法所调整的对象财产关系是属于经济基础还是属于上层建筑的问题的争论。这个问题的实质，是作为上层建筑之一的法如何对人民实际生活起作用的问题。如果这一问题不能获得很好的正确的解决，就会在民法教学工作中，不能有统一的正确的解释，就会影响我国建立体系完整的、确切的民法科学，也会影响我国正在制订中的民法恰如其分地反映我国人民的实际生活。因此，目前在我国开展这一问题的讨论，有很大的现实意义。
      “政法研究”杂志在1956年第二、第三和第五期上，发表了关于这个问题的六篇论文。此后，该杂志编辑部又先后组织了两次关于这个问题的座谈会。这一问题的讨论引起了有关单位的同志们的极大兴趣和重视。
    讨论开始时，大都是从马克思列宁主义经典著作中，从苏联的法学著作中，找到有关财产关系的论据，加以阐述。因各人的体会不尽一样，运用和发挥起来，也就有一致的地方，有不同的地方。相同的地方是：大家都认为民法是上层建筑的法的一个组成部门，它是调整一定的社会关系的。大家也都同意，在社会主义社会中，民法主要调整社会主义组织相互之间、社会主义组织与公民之间、公民相互之间的财产关系（民法还调整与财产关系相联系的人身非财产关系，如著作权等）。这种财产关系，是由所有制产生，并且与价值规律和按劳分配规律的作用相联系。不同的地方是对财产关系的性质，是属于上层建筑还是属于基础的范围问题，有以下两种不同的意见。
    一种意见认为，我国民法调整的主要对象——财产关系，既是由所有制产生，又与产品分配相联系，财产关系应属于生产关系的范畴，而且，这种财产关系是不受人的意志或意识所左右的，是客观存在着的，是按其本身规律发展的社会物质关系。它既是社会物质关系，又是生产关系，因此，它应该包括在经济基础之内。
    另一种意见认为，民法调整的对象——财产关系，是生产关系在法律上的表现，既是法律表现，那末应是组成民法规范的民事法律关系，它属于法的范畴。而民事法律关系的形成过程是受双方当事人的意志或意识所左右的，因此，它又是社会思想关系。它既是属于法的范畴，又是社会思想关系，应属于上层建筑的范围。
    这两种不同的意见，在争论当中有三个交叉点。首先是对思想关系有着不同的理解。甲种意见认为思想关系是通过社会意识起作用而形成的社会关系；乙种意见认为思想关系是通过双方当事人的意志起作用而形成的社会关系。所以会发生这个交叉点，主要是由于持有乙种意见的同志，认为民事法律关系的形成过程同思想关系的形成过程同样是由当事人的意志起决定作用的，所以民事法律关系属于社会思想关系；而民法调整的对象财产关系即是民事法律关系，所以这种财产关系是属于思想关系的。而持甲种意见的同志，则想用社会思想关系的形成是通过社会意识一点，来说明乙种意见对社会思想关系了解错了，反驳乙种意见的理论根据。
    其次，是对“调整”的涵义的理解有所不同。甲种意见认为“调整”是“调节”（即有确认、巩固、发展和限制、抑止、消灭的作用）的意思，法律在同一经济规律方向内，是能对生产关系起调节作用，即起调整作用的；乙种意见认为“调整”就是“决定”的意思，法律既不能决定生产关系，也就不能调整生产关系。
    第三，是对民事法律关系的理解不同。甲种意见认为法律关系是民法规范的具体实施，与民法是一致的，法是阶级斗争的工具，民法是法的一部门，因此，民事法律关系是工具，不是被调整的对象；乙种意见认为构成民事法律关系的主要内容是当事人的权利与义务，民法正是调整这种权利与义务，因此，民事法律关系是被调整的对象。这里，乙种意见想以民事法律关系不依赖于民法规范而独立的说法，来解释民事法律关系是被调整的对象；而甲种意见恰好相反，认为民事法律关系与民法规范是一致的，法律关系是具体实现着的法律规范，也就是法律规范调整社会关系的结果，因此民事法律关系不是民法调整的对象。
    另外，甲种意见认为财产关系的经济内容是现实形态的财产关系，即是生产关系；财产关系的法律外衣是财产法律关系，亦即体现出财产关系的法律形式是民事法律关系。法律关系是一种社会关系的特殊表现形式。法律关系是依赖于法律规范的，而法律规范是通过法律关系来调整经济内容的。乙种意见认为财产关系是生产关系在法律上的表现，是组成民法规范的民事法律关系，是能离开民法规范而独立的，因此是由民法来调整的。
    讨论展开以后，涉及的问题较广较深。争论双方不但引用了最近苏联法学界的新的论证，如对法律关系与法律规范之间的关系的论证等，并且开始接触我国现实生活中的一些实际问题，如对调整、法律关系等，作了一些不同的具体分析。争论的交叉点也较开始讨论时更加扼要，更加实际，因而最近集中在一个主要问题上，即作为上层建筑之一的民法如何反作用于经济基础的问题，亦即民法是直接作用于经济基础，还是间接作用于经济基础的问题。关于这个问题有两种意见。
    甲种意见认为民法直接反作用于经济基础。但在这里也有两个多少有些分歧的看法。
    一是认为民法通过民事法律关系（即实施中的民法）调整财产关系（即生产关系），换句话说，即民法通过具体的实施，调整生产关系，直接反作用于经济基础。
    他们是这样来描绘这个过程的。民法所调整的财产关系，即是人们之间根据自己的经济、文化等需要所发生的财产关系，这种关系符合民法规定，民法就确认当事人的权利与义务（即民法给这种财产关系披上民事法律关系的外衣），并且民法借国家的强制力量来保证权利的实现和义务的履行，如有一方不履行义务，损害他方的正当权利，民法即加以干涉，使其负一定的民事责任；如果人们之间所发生的财产关系不符合民法的规定，民法就不确认当事人的权利与义务，还给以一定的制裁。这正如恩格斯在“费尔巴哈与德国古典哲学的终结”中所指出的，“民法的作用在本质上就是要把各个人彼此在一定情况下所有的正常经济关系确认起来”，这里提到的经济关系是财产关系，民法给这种财产关系披上民事法律关系的外衣，民法正是通过这种民事法律关系（财产关系的法律形式），调整财产关系，直接反作用于经济基础。
    一是认为民法通过约束人们的行为，直接反作用于经济基础。
    他们是这样来描绘这个过程的：人们为了生活，必须进行生产活动，这些活动使得生产关系不断更新，民法就是在这不断更新的过程中发挥调整作用的。民法是由国家强制力量保证实行的行为规则，可以用规定权利和义务或禁止的办法，来约束人们的行为，以实现统治阶级的经济要求，巩固与发展有利于统治阶级的生产关系，限制与消灭不利于统治阶级的生产关系。因此，民法是通过约束当事人的行为直接反作用于经济基础的。
    乙种意见认为民法调整民事法律关系，间接作用于经济基础。
    他们是这样来描绘这个过程的。他们认为财产关系是民事法律关系，也是思想关系，因为它是通过当事人的意志而形成的社会关系。比如拿买卖关系来说，一定要通过双方当事人的意志，表示愿意买与卖，才能发生，也才能形成当事人的权利与义务的民事法律关系。民法就是通过调整这种民事法律关系（如调整所有权关系、买卖关系等）来影响所有制关系、交换关系等。民法通过调整民事法律关系（即财产关系），即由国家规定与保护民事法律关系，来影响经济基础。
    认为民法直接反作用于经济基础的人，认为上面这样的描绘在逻辑上是讲不通的，如果承认民法调整民事法律关系，即等于说民法调整民法本身。这就低估了民法对经济基础的作用。
    就这一阶段的讨论情况来看，大家在马克思列宁主义的经典著作中的名词、概念上着眼多，而从我国实际情况出发作具体分析较少。因此，要使这次讨论能获得很好的效果，必须把马克思列宁主义有关民法的理论与我国的具体实际情况结合起来，作具体的分析。
