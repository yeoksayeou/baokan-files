Xinhua News Agency, 4th. American, British and French bourgeois news agencies and newspapers have paid close attention to the article "Once More on the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship" published in the "People's Daily" in Beijing on December 29th. News agencies in various countries have broadcast news, summaries, or commentaries about this article. Many important newspapers have published reports about this article in prominent positions and have published commentaries.

The strengthening of the international unity of the proletariat with the Soviet Union as its center, as proposed in the "People's Daily" article, has made a deep impression among commentators in various countries. Many commentaries have had to admit that the imperialists' illusions about a break in the firm unity between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union and the two Communist Parties have been completely shattered.

The British "Sunday Times" said that "in the foreseeable future," "China will stand firmly with Russia." The "Manchester Guardian" commented that China's entire argument is "advocating that (various) Communist Parties must maintain unity."

In addition, the interest of Western newspapers and news agencies is also concentrated on two issues: the advice given to the Yugoslav comrades in the People's Daily article, and the assessment of Stalin's merits and demerits, especially the comment that "Stalin's mistakes are only secondary compared to his achievements."

    美英法资产阶级报纸纷纷评论
    认为中苏坚强团结使帝国主义的幻想破灭
    新华社4日讯　美、英、法资产阶级通讯社和报纸非常注意12月29日北京“人民日报”刊载的“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”的文章。各国通讯社都播发了有关这篇文章的消息、摘要或述评。许多重要报纸以显著的地位刊登了关于这篇文章的报道，并且发表了评论。
      “人民日报”文章提出的加强以苏联为中心的无产阶级的国际团结，在各国评论员中间造成了深刻的印象。许多评论不得不承认：帝国主义关于中苏两国人民和两国共产党之间的坚固团结会发生破裂的幻想完全破灭了。
    英国的“星期日泰晤士报”说，“在可以看得到的将来”，“中国将同俄国坚决地站在一起”。“曼彻斯特卫报”的评论说，中国的整个论点是“主张（各国）共产党必须保持团结”。
    此外，西方报刊和通讯社的兴趣还集中在这样两个问题上，这就是人民日报文章中对南斯拉夫同志们提出的劝告，对斯大林功过的估计，特别是关于“斯大林的错误同他的成绩比较起来，只居于第二位的地位”的评论。
