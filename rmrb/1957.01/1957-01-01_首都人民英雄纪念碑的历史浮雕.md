The historical reliefs of the Monument to the People's Heroes in the Capital
Liu Kaiqu

    Forever commemorating our revolutionary martyrs! They waged magnificent struggles against imperialism, feudalism, and the rule of reactionaries. May our motherland forever enjoy independence, freedom, and happiness!

    Forever cherishing the memory of our revolutionary martyrs! Their heroic, arduous, and fearless revolutionary spirit will forever inspire our people to strive for the construction of socialism and the realization of a communist society under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    In order to commemorate and vividly represent the great deeds of the martyrs and preserve them for eternity, the Capital People's Heroes Monument Construction Committee decided to carve huge revolutionary historical reliefs in white marble on the monument.

    The revolutionary historical reliefs of the monument are installed on the grand Sumeru base of the monument. There are eight pieces: (1) Crossing the Yangtze River Victoriously, (2) Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Warfare, (3) Nanchang Uprising, (4) May 30th Movement, (5) May Fourth Movement, (6) Wuchang Uprising, (7) Jintian Uprising, (8) Burning Opium. To the left and right of "Crossing the Yangtze River Victoriously" are two decorative reliefs: (1) Supporting the Front Lines, (2) Celebrating Liberation. After more than ten months of effort by the sculptors, the full-size reliefs have been completed (the decorative reliefs are not yet finished), and the work of carving them in Fangshan white marble is currently underway. The reliefs are two meters high, with a total length of more than forty meters for the ten pieces, and depict more than one hundred and seventy figures.

    The position, number, and size of the reliefs on the monument were determined based on the architectural design of the monument. The historical period commemorated by the monument extends from 1949 back to 1840, that is, from the period of the Liberation War to the Opium War. Only ten subjects can be represented by the eight reliefs and two decorative reliefs. Which revolutionary historical events from the past century should be chosen as subjects? In order to determine subjects that could better represent this century of history, the artists studied the history of the past century, consulted with the famous historian Fan Wenlan and professors and scholars familiar with the conditions of the past century, and repeatedly solicited opinions from relevant parties across the country. After a long period of discussion and many changes, the subjects currently used were finally decided. Should a symbolic method or a narrative method with plot be used in the carving and expression? After several studies, it was decided to use a narrative method to express it. Because the subjects to be expressed included historical events from different eras, it would be very difficult to describe them in a symbolic way; secondly, in order to allow the masses of people to appreciate the magnificent revolutionary history of the martyrs from the perspective of the subjects expressed in the reliefs after the monument was erected, a narrative expression method was also appropriate. In order to better organize and explain the subject matter and plot more fully, the famous painters in Beijing, Wu Zuoren, Gu Yuan, Yan Han, Wang Shikui, Dong Xiwen, Ai Zhongxin, Li Zongjin, Feng Fasi, Xin Mang, etc., and sculptors were organized from the beginning to discuss and draft the reliefs. Sculptors and painters carried out unprecedented and profound work in Chinese history with unparalleled enthusiasm. Not only were many discussion meetings held on the drawings and subsequent eighth and quarter-scale sculpted drafts, but the drafts were also sent to relevant parties for comments and were publicly exhibited twice; during the process of sculpting the full-size reliefs, the sculptors also received assistance from the troops, historians, painters, and various other parties.

    The eight sculptors Liu Kaiqu, Zhang Songhe, Xiao Chuanjiu, Hua Tianyou, Wang Linyi, Fu Tianchou, Wang Bingzhao, and Zeng Zhushao shared the creation of the ten reliefs; at the same time, sixteen or seventeen young sculptors also undertook the indispensable assistance work in sculpting. Dozens of skilled stone carving artisans are performing the white marble stone carving work.

    The revolutionary historical reliefs of the monument are now basically completed. The artists who undertook the work feel infinite glory. Throughout the entire work process, the various opinions put forward by all parties across the country regarding the reliefs have not only helped the artists in their work but have also enabled them to recognize and appreciate many other beneficial things. The artists are very grateful.

    Editor's Note: The eight reliefs of the Capital People's Heroes Monument will be published in this newspaper's supplement starting today. (Attached picture)

    首都人民英雄纪念碑的历史浮雕
    刘开渠
    永远纪念着我们的革命先烈！他们轰轰烈烈地进行反帝、反封建、消灭反动派统治的斗争。让我们祖国永远获得独立、自由、幸福！
    永远怀念着我们的革命先烈！他们英勇、坚苦奋斗、不怕牺牲的革命精神，永远鼓舞着我们全国人民，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，为建设社会主义，走向共产主义社会而奋斗。
    为了纪念和具体而又形象地表现先烈们的伟大事迹，并留存千古，首都人民英雄纪念碑兴建委员会决定在纪念碑上以汉白玉刻制巨大的革命历史浮雕。
    纪念碑的革命历史浮雕是安装在纪念碑的大须弥座上的，共有八块：（1）胜利渡长江，（2）抗日游击战，（3）南昌起义，（4）五卅运动，（5）五四运动，（6）武昌起义，（7）金田起义，（8）焚毁鸦片。在“胜利渡长江”左右，有两块装饰性的浮雕：（1）支援前线，（2）庆祝解放。足尺浮雕经雕塑家们十个多月的时间努力创作，现均告完成（装饰浮雕尚未塑完），目前正在进行刻成房山汉白玉的工作。浮雕高为二公尺，十块共长四十公尺余，人物共有一百七十余个。
    纪念碑的浮雕地位、块数与大小尺寸，是根据配合纪念碑的建筑设计定出的。纪念碑所纪念的历史时期，自1949年起，上溯到1840年，即从解放战争时期到鸦片战争时期。八块浮雕和两块装饰浮雕，共只能表现十个题材，选择近百年中的哪些革命历史事迹作为题材呢？为了确定能够较好地代表这一百年历史的题材，艺术家们学习了近百年史，请了著名的历史家范文澜和熟悉近百年情况的教授与学者出主意，又曾多次地向全国各有关方面征求意见，中间经过长时间的讨论以至多次的更改，才决定现在所采用的题材。在雕刻的表现方法上，采用象征性的方法，还是采用有情节的叙述性的表现方法呢？经过若干次的研究，决定用叙述性的方法去表现。因为所需表现的这些题材是包括不同时代的历史事迹，用象征的方式去描写是有很多困难的；其次，为了在碑立起后，让千千万万的群众，能从浮雕所表现的题材角度上，体会到先烈们轰轰烈烈的革命历史情况，也以叙述性的表现方式为宜。为了能更好地把题材情节组织与说明得更充分，浮雕一开始就组织了在北京的著名画家吴作人、古元、彦涵、王式廓、董希文、艾中信、李宗津、冯法禩、辛莽等和雕刻家一起商议起稿。雕塑家和画家以无比的热情，进行了在中国历史上从未有过的巨大的深刻的工作。对画稿和以后的八分之一和四分之一的塑稿，不仅开了不少的讨论会，还将稿寄给各有关方面请提意见，并曾公开展览了二次；在足尺浮雕的塑造过程中，雕刻家们同样地得到了部队、历史家、画家与各方面的帮助。
    刘开渠、张松鹤、萧传玖、滑田友、王临乙、傅天仇、王丙召、曾竹韶八位雕塑家分担十块浮雕的创作；同时，前后有十六、七位青年雕塑家也担负了在塑造上不能缺少的协助工作。在汉白玉石刻工作中，有几十位技术优良的石刻艺人进行雕刻。
    纪念碑的革命历史浮雕现在基本上完成了。担任工作的艺术家们感觉到有无限的光荣。在整个工作过程中，全国各方面对浮雕所提的各种意见，使艺术家们不仅在工作上得到了帮助，也认识到和体会到了其它有关的许多有益的东西。艺术家们是十分感谢的。
    编者附记：首都人民英雄纪念碑的八块浮雕，今天起在本报副刊陆续刊载。（附图片）
