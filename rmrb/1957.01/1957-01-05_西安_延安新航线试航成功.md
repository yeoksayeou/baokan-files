Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 4th. The new Xi'an-Yan'an air route was successfully test flown on the 4th. The plane that took off from Xi'an today flew along the Xianyang-Songjiachuan highway and completed the 300-plus kilometer journey in only one hour and three minutes, landing safely at Yan'an Dongguan Airport. After the plane landed in Yan'an, tens of thousands of people surged into the airport to welcome the test flight personnel and view the aircraft.

Yan'an is a heroic city that people at home and abroad yearn for and admire. In recent years, many foreign guests have traveled there by car, braving the dust and wind, with the fastest journey taking more than a day. In order to facilitate transportation between Xi'an and Yan'an, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee suggested that the Civil Aviation Administration of China open a new air route between Xi'an and Yan'an. This test flight is for the future official opening of this new air route.

    西安——延安新航线试航成功
    新华社西安4日电　西安—延安的新航线在4日试航成功。今天从西安起飞的飞机，沿着咸（阳）宋（家川）公路只用一小时零三分钟就飞完了三百多公里航程，平安地降落在延安东关飞机场。这架飞机在延安降落以后，成千上万的人潮涌似地进入机场，欢迎试航人员并参观飞机。
    延安是中外人士向往和敬仰的英雄之城。几年来，曾有不少外宾乘坐着汽车风尘仆仆地前往参观，行程最快也要一天多。陕西省人民委员会为便利西安—延安的交通，曾建议中国民用航空局在西安—延安间新辟航线。这次试航，就是为了将来正式开辟这条新航线。
