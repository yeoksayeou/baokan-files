    Jordanian Minister of State Expresses
    Determination to Abolish the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 15th: Abdallah Rimawi, the Jordanian Minister of State and a member of the Jordanian government delegation participating in aid negotiations in Cairo, said on the 14th that the negotiations between Jordan and Egypt regarding the provision of financial assistance to Jordan were "very successful."
    He said that if Jordan can reach an agreement with Arab countries on the issue of aid, the Jordanian government will take action through diplomatic channels to abolish the British-Jordanian treaty. He pointed out that this treaty, which stipulates that Britain has the right to maintain military bases and station military personnel in Jordan, should be terminated. He said: "The cancellation of British bases (in Jordan) and the withdrawal of personnel are the national goals of Jordan. We are determined to achieve this goal."
    The Jordanian government delegation has concluded negotiations with the Egyptian government and is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia on the 15th for negotiations. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria have all previously expressed their willingness to provide financial assistance to Jordan to replace the approximately 12 million pounds sterling in annual financial subsidies that Britain gives to Jordan, thus enabling Jordan to abolish the British-Jordanian treaty.
    Rimawi also said that the financial assistance provided by Arab countries will be more than just financial assistance. "It will be a step towards unprecedented Arab unity... If Jordan ends the treaty signed with Britain, there will be nothing to prevent us from participating in the proposed Syrian-Egyptian federation."

    约旦国务大臣表示
    决心废除英约条约
    据新华社15日讯　开罗消息：在开罗参加援助谈判的约旦政府代表团团员、约旦国务大臣阿卜杜拉·里马维14日说，约旦同埃及进行的关于向约旦提供财政援助的谈判“非常成功”。
    他说，约旦要是能够同阿拉伯国家就援助问题达成协议的话，约旦政府将通过外交途径采取行动，来废除英国—约旦条约。他指出，应该结束这项规定英国有权在约旦保有军事基地和驻扎军事人员的条约。他说：“英国（在约旦）基地的取消和人员的撤退是约旦的民族目标。我们决心实现这个目标。”
    约旦政府代表团已经结束同埃及政府进行的谈判，预定在15日前往沙特阿拉伯谈判。埃及、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚三国过去都表示愿意向约旦提供财政援助，来代替英国给约旦的每年约一千二百万英镑的财政津贴，这样使约旦能够废除英国—约旦条约。
    里马维还说，阿拉伯国家所提供的财政援助将不仅仅是一种财政援助。“它将是走向阿拉伯空前团结一致的一步……如果约旦结束同英国签订的条约，那就没有东西能够阻止我们参加拟议中的叙利亚—埃及联邦。”
