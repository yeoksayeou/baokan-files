Sichuan and Shanghai People Praise the People's Liberation Army for Loving the People

This newspaper reports that before the Spring Festival, the people of Sichuan wrote letters to the Chengdu Military Region troops to thank them for their meritorious deeds in loving the people. Over the past few years, the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have always stood at the forefront of safeguarding the interests of the people. In the early days of liberation, after eliminating more than 700,000 Kuomintang bandits, they immediately devoted themselves to the struggle to help the people build their country. As "pioneers," they first participated in the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and then successively built the great projects of the Chengdu-Aba Highway and the Kangding-Tibet Highway. Last year, they not only purchased more than 700,000 yuan of patriotic bonds, but also donated 620,000 yuan to purchase tractors and new agricultural implements to support agricultural cooperation. In addition to actively helping the masses to rescue floods, they also donated more than 4.2 million yuan to help disaster victims. Many garrison troops voluntarily helped agricultural cooperatives to cultivate land, harvest crops, and accumulate fertilizer. Fourteen units alone supported agricultural cooperatives with nearly 600,000 workdays, and helped the masses in Neijiang, Suining, and Luzhou accumulate 560,000 dan of fertilizer. In addition, they also donated more than 30,000 books and a large number of cultural and recreational supplies to the masses. The troops stationed in the Liangshan, Aba, and Ganzi minority areas earnestly implemented the Party's ethnic policies, supported democratic reforms, and helped with production, road construction, medical treatment, and disaster relief, forming a deep friendship with the minority nationalities. Tibetan compatriots called them good soldiers of Chairman Mao, the sun during the day and the moon at night.

This newspaper reports that in the past year, the officers and soldiers stationed in Shanghai loved state property and actively helped the people in emergency rescue and disaster relief, which was deeply praised by the people.

The officers and soldiers of the 8th Company of a certain unit stationed in the suburbs, during an attack by a level 12 typhoon, bravely rescued 200,000 catties of wheat from a warehouse that was about to collapse. The officers and soldiers also repaired embankments and dredged canals on a stormy night, ensuring that 990,000 catties of rice and wheat were safe and sound. One night last year when a typhoon hit Shanghai, the officers and soldiers of the 4th and 6th Companies of a certain unit braved the wind and rain and walked more than 40 miles to repair 15,000 meters of river embankment, saving more than 1,000 mu of rice and more than 30,000 mu of cotton fields from loss.

The officers and soldiers also actively helped the people to fight fires. According to statistics from a certain unit of the Public Security Army, they fought a total of 74 fires last year. Soldiers of the 11th squad of a certain company stationed in Hongqiao, once discovered a fire during a thunderstorm. The entire squad immediately swam across a three-meter-deep stinking ditch and rushed to the fire site to put out the fire and rescued many valuables.

The people of Shanghai thanked the People's Liberation Army for their great help and sent a large number of letters of thanks to the leading organs of the troops stationed in Shanghai. A farmer in the western suburbs also composed a ballad: "The stars in the sky, the Big Dipper is the brightest; the heroes on earth, the People's Liberation Army is the strongest," to praise the heroic behavior and noble qualities of the People's Liberation Army.

    天上的星星  北斗星最亮
    地上的英雄  解放军最强
    四川上海群众赞扬解放军爱民
    本报讯　春节前夕，四川人民纷纷写信给成都军区部队感谢他们的爱民功绩。几年来，解放军官兵始终站在维护人民利益的最前列。解放初期，他们在消灭国民党土匪七十余万之后，立即投入帮助人民建设的斗争，作为“开路先锋”，他们首先参加兴修成渝铁路，然后又相继兴修了成阿公路、康藏公路的伟大工程。去年他们不但认购了七十多万元的爱国公债，而且捐献出六十二万元购买拖拉机和新式农具支援农业合作化。他们除积极帮助群众抢救水灾，还捐献了四百二十多万元救济灾民。许多驻军义务帮助农业社进行耕地收割积肥，仅十四个单位就支援农业社近六十万个劳动日，在内江、遂宁、沪州帮群众积肥五十六万担，此外还赠送了三万多册图书和大批文娱用品给群众。驻凉山、阿坝、甘孜少数民族地区部队认真执行党的民族政策，支援民主改革，帮助生产、修路、医病、救灾，同少数民族结成了深厚的友谊，藏族同胞称他们是毛主席的好战士，是白天的太阳黑夜的月亮。
    本报讯　去年一年来驻上海的部队官兵们热爱国家财产，积极帮助人民抢险救灾，深受人民群众的赞扬。
    驻在郊区的某部八连的官兵们，在一次十二级台风的侵袭中，奋不顾身地从将要倒塌的仓库中抢救出二十万斤小麦。官兵们还在暴风雨的夜晚修堤开渠，使九十九万斤米麦安全无损。去年台风袭击上海的一个夜晚，某部四连和六连的官兵们冒着狂风暴雨，步行四十余里，抢修了一万五千公尺的河堤，使附近一千多亩稻子和三万多亩棉田免遭损失。
    官兵们还积极地帮助人民群众救火，据公安军某部统计，他们去年救火共七十四次。驻在虹桥的某连十一班士兵，有一次在雷电交加的时候，发现了火警，全班士兵立即泅过了一条三公尺深的臭水沟，赶到失火地点，扑灭了火灾，抢救出许多贵重物品。
    上海人民感谢解放军给予他们的巨大帮助，给驻上海的部队领导机关寄了大批的感谢信，西郊有一位农民还编了一首歌谣：“天上的星星，要算北斗星最亮；地上的英雄，要算解放军最强。”来歌颂解放军的英勇行为和高尚品质。　　（张哲明）
