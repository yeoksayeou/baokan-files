    Xinhua News Agency, Krakow, January 14th. On the afternoon of the 13th, over 5,000 people from all walks of life in Krakow, a city of culture and history in Poland, gathered at the Sports Hall to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai.

    Most of those present were young people, and their emotions were particularly high. When Premier Zhou Enlai and others, accompanied by Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz and First Secretary of the Krakow Provincial Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party Drodner (previously incorrectly reported as First Secretary of the Krakow City Committee and Drodreul, respectively), entered the hall, everyone stood up and cheered and applauded for several minutes.

    Comrade Drodner first gave a speech at the meeting. When he said the phrase "heartfelt welcome to the representatives of the great Chinese people," the crowd stood up again and applauded, and sang the Polish folk song "May He Live Among Us for a Hundred Years."

    Chairman Cyrankiewicz then spoke (for a summary of the speech, see page 4). He talked about the development of friendly cooperation between China and Poland in the political, economic, and cultural fields.

    Afterwards, Premier Zhou Enlai spoke (for a summary of the speech, see page 4). As soon as his speech ended, the crowd stood up again and applauded, and shouted: "Long live People's China!" "Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!" Premier Zhou Enlai also shouted to everyone: "Long live the Polish people!" At this time, the Polish comrades present sang the folk song "May He Live Among Us for a Hundred Years" again, and then the entire audience stood up and sang the Internationale.

    Comrade Drodner delivered the closing remarks, saying: "There is a line in Polish folk songs that says: 'While we still live, Poland will not perish.' Now we can say: 'While we still live, Poland will not only not perish, but will also become more consolidated and prosperous on the road to socialism.'" The entire audience cheered again.

  　After the mass meeting, Krakow's artistic groups performed many touching artistic programs with strong local characteristics. These traditional artistic programs attracted the visiting Chinese dignitaries.

    Xinhua News Agency, Krakow, January 14th. The Presidium of the Krakow City People's Council held a banquet at 8:00 PM on the 13th to host Premier Zhou Enlai and the Chinese government delegation.

    Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz, Minister of Metallurgical Industry Żymajtys, Chairman of the Krakow Provincial People's Council Garting, and First Secretary of the Krakow City Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party Olchowski were all present as escorts.

    Acting Chairman of the Krakow City People's Council Garlicki said to the distinguished guests that Krakow is a city with a long history, ancient cultural traditions, and revolutionary traditions, and has experienced many patriotic and revolutionary people's uprisings in history. He raised his glass to congratulate the Chinese guests and the development of Sino-Polish friendship.

    Premier Zhou Enlai also raised his glass to congratulate the city of Krakow, which has a long history and revolutionary traditions, and has a modern industry like the Lenin Metallurgical Combine. He also wished the working people of Krakow great achievements in socialist construction. He also proposed a toast to the unbreakable and increasingly developing friendship between the Chinese and Polish peoples.
