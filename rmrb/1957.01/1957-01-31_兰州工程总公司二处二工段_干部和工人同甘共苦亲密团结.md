According to Gansu Daily, the leading cadres of the Second Engineering Section of the Second Engineering Division of the Lanzhou Engineering Corporation and its affiliated grassroots organizations have improved their leadership style, eating and living with the workers, sharing joys and hardships, making the relationship between leaders and the masses closer, and greatly changing the face of production.
    The party and mass cadres and administrative cadres of the Second Engineering Section did not originally have very close relations with the workers. They came to work and left work, and did not understand or care enough about the workers' thoughts and lives. After October last year, the party's general branch mobilized all cadres to improve their work style. The branch secretaries, captains, professional foremen, etc. of the team lived with the workers. In the evening, after the workers got off work, the general branch secretary, section chief, chairman of the trade union, and other cadres went to the workers' dormitories to talk with the workers about life, thoughts, and production, and solicit their opinions. The party branch's office could often see groups of workers. The cadre in charge of finance went to the workers' dormitory to handle reimbursement and payment matters, saving the workers' time.
    Living with the workers also made them more aware of the workers' actual difficulties, and they could immediately find ways to help solve the workers' difficulties. If the stoves in the workers' dormitories were bad or the windows leaked, the administration would fix them within a time limit. The trade union provided relief to 36 workers in the section who had financial difficulties. During the New Year, when the workers' families could not buy pork and scallions, the trade union uniformly bought a batch for the families to eat, and also visited sick workers and their families.
    Because of the leaders' concern for the workers in their thoughts and lives, the workers were deeply moved. Those who originally wanted to go home did not go, and those who wanted to find work elsewhere did not. By December last year, advanced producers accounted for 80% of the total number of employees in the section, and they completed more than twice the monthly plan, making up for the shortfall in the previous uncompleted plans, so that the section completed the annual plan with a surplus of 1.6%.

    兰州工程总公司二处二工段
    干部和工人同甘共苦亲密团结
    据甘肃日报消息　兰州工程总公司第二工程处第二工段和所属基层组织的领导干部，改进领导作风，跟工人群众同吃、同住，共甘苦，使领导跟群众关系更加密切，大大地改变了生产面貌。
    二工段党群干部和行政干部原来同工人关系不太密切，上班来下班去，对工人思想与生活情况了解关心不够。去年10月以后，党总支动员全体干部改进工作作风。队的支部书记、队长、专业工长等同工人住在一起。晚上，工人下班以后，总支书记、段长、工会主席和其他干部就到工人宿舍去，和工人们谈生活、谈思想、谈生产，征求工人们的意见。党支部的办公室里常常可以看到成群成伙的工人。管理财务的干部到工人宿舍去时，兼办报销和领款事项，节省了工人们的时间。
    跟工人生活在一起，对工人的实际困难也有了更多的了解，并可以即时设法帮助解决工人的困难。工人宿舍炉子不好、窗户漏风，行政上就限期修好。全段三十六户工人生活困难，工会就予以救济。新年时职工家属买不到大肉和葱，工会就统一买了一批给家属食用，同时还慰问了有病的工人和家属。
    由于领导干部在思想上、生活上对工人们的关怀，使工人深受感动，原来要回家的不回了，想到别处找工作的不找了。到去年12月份，全段先进生产者占到职工总数的80％，完成全月计划两倍以上，弥补了以前未完成计划的缺额，使全段超额1.6％完成了全年计划。
