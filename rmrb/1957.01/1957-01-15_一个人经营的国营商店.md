    A State-Owned Store Run by One Person
    In Xiaojiawan, Qingshan, Wuhan, there is a state-owned small store run by a single person. This small store is located in the home of a local farmer, with only an inconspicuous sign at the door that reads "Qingshan Retail Company Xiaojiawan Station." But it attracts many local workers and farmers.
    There are often more than a hundred kinds of goods displayed in this small store. As long as the market is not short of goods, you can buy them here. The person who runs this small store is named Zhang Dongsheng. He is very good at meeting the different needs of consumers. For example, he puts bread, biscuits, pastries, etc. on the counter very early every morning to sell to workers going to work and pupils going to school; in the morning or at noon, he prepares oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, soap, matches, etc. to sell to staff family members or farmers. He also often cuts cooked meat and pickles, pours wine, and marks the prices, so that workers can sit down and eat as soon as they get off work, buying as soon as they arrive. Because this small store provides many conveniences to workers and farmers, business is very prosperous, and people come to buy things one after another every day.
    Although this small store does not have a complete set of systems, the accounts are very clear. In addition to keeping the purchase requisition slips, Zhang Dongsheng only has a small notebook, recording the amount of money for the goods sold every day. He takes stock once every ten days and summarizes it once a month. There is money for what has been sold, and goods for what has not been sold. There has never been a mistake since it opened. The monthly expenses are only his salary and six yuan of rent, which is very much in line with the principle of thrift.
    Zhang Dongsheng is naturally very busy running the small store by himself. However, he often uses the time of buying and selling goods to understand the needs of consumers, and purchases goods according to the needs of consumers, so he can buy and sell well. Not only is there no backlog, but he can also complete the task every month. ·Chang Jiang·

    一个人经营的国营商店
    武汉青山肖家湾，有一个独人经营的国营小商店。这个小商店设在当地农民的家里，门口只有一块“国营青山零售公司肖家湾站”的不醒目的招牌。但它却吸引着当地许多工人和农民。
    陈列在这个小商店里的货物，经常有一百多种。凡是日常用品，只要市场上不缺货，在这里都可以买到。经营这个小商店的人，名叫张冬生。他很会根据消费者的不同要求，来满足他们的需要。比如：他每天早晨很早就把面包、饼子、糕点等摆在柜台里，卖给上班的工人和上学的小学生；上午或中午就把油、盐、酱、醋、肥皂、火柴等准备好，卖给职工家属或农民。他还常常把卤肉、咸菜切好，把酒打好，标上价格，让下班后的工人坐下就能吃，随到随买。因为这个小商店给了工人和农民许多方便，所以生意十分兴隆，每天来买东西的人总是接踵而来。
    这个小商店，虽然没有成套的制度，但账目却很清楚。张冬生除了保存进货的拨货单外，只有一个小本子，记着每天卖出去的货物的钱数。每十天盘存一次，每个月总结一次，卖了的就有钱，没有卖的就有货，开业以来从未出过一次差错。每月的开支，也只有他一人的工资和六元钱的房租，非常合乎节约原则。
    张冬生一个人经营小商店，自然是很忙的。但他常常利用买卖货物的时间去了解消费者的需要，根据消费者的需要进货，因而也就能买得进卖得出，不仅没有积压，还能月月完成任务。　·长江·
