    Relics of the Ancient Dian Kingdom

    At the ancient site of Shizhaishan in Jinning County, Yunnan Province, a gold seal bearing the inscription “Seal of the Dian King,” used by the descendants of the Chu general Zhuang Qiao – the ancient Dian kings – was discovered. More than two hundred other ancient artifacts were also found along with the seal. The vast majority of these were bronzes, but there were also ironware, gold objects, and agate beads and tubes.

    At each end of the ancient tombs at the site, there were male bronze figurines facing each other, east and west. Next to the bronze figurines were drum-shaped containers. Beside the containers were small bronze houses, the structure of which was a ground floor and an upper floor. The ground floor was used for raising livestock, and the upper floor was for human habitation. Regarding the attire of the figures, both men and women wore skirts, but no trousers, and all were barefoot. The livestock included cattle and horses.

    在遗址中古墓的两端，各有男铜俑东西相对。在铜俑的旁边有鼓形盛具器。在盛具器之旁又有小铜房子，其结构是一楼一底，底层饲养牲畜，楼上住人。人物的装束，不分男女都穿裙子，不穿裤子，全是赤足。牲畜有牛马等。　（丽琼　德娴）
