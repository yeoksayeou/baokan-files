Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 5th: The Chinese Communist Party's Pi County Committee and the Pi County People's Committee, in order to strengthen grassroots organizations in rural areas, decided on January 3rd to send more than 150 cadres from county-level government offices to work in rural areas long-term.

Among the cadres being transferred to the countryside, two are alternate members of the County Party Committee, fourteen are current deputy county heads, deputy directors, deputy bureau chiefs, or section chiefs, twenty-six are cadres equivalent to district committee level, and the rest are personnel who have worked in rural areas for a long time. After going to the countryside, some will take on Party work, and most will specifically take on the work of production, civil affairs, culture and education, and the township mutual aid cooperation committees under the township (town) People's Committees. After all of them go to the countryside, each of the sixteen townships in Pi County will now have an average of two district committee-level cadres and six to seven new general cadres.

At the same time, the Chinese Communist Party's Pi County Committee also decided that all members of the County Party Committee must work in rural areas for half a year out of the year.

Prior to this, the county-level government offices in Pi County were somewhat bloated, with some people having nothing to do. This phenomenon became even more prominent, especially after the merger of townships and the abolition of districts in 1956, when cadres from the original district-level organizations were transferred to the county. Some cadres complained about being "bloated cadres" because their departments' work was light; other cadres had low work enthusiasm after being transferred. More importantly, after the abolition of districts and merger of townships, the leadership strength at the township level was not strengthened, and their tasks became heavier.

    郫县抽出一百五十多名机关干部
    长期派到农村工作
    新华社成都5日电　中共四川郫县委员会和郫县人民委员会为加强农村基层组织，1月3日决定将一百五十多名县级机关的干部，长期派到农村去工作。
    这批调往农村工作的干部，其中有两名是县委候补委员，十四名是现任副县长、副部长、副局长或科长，二十六名是相当区委级的干部，其它的也都是曾经在农村长期工作过的人员。他们下乡后，有的准备担任党的工作，大部人员将具体担任乡（镇）人民委员会的生产、民政、文教和乡互助合作委员会的工作。他们全部下乡后，郫县十六个乡今后平均每乡将有区委级干部两人，新添一般干部六人到七人。
    与此同时，中共郫县委员会还决定，所有县委委员一年当中必须有半年时间在农村工作。
    在这以前，郫县县级机关机构有些臃肿，出现人浮于事的现象，特别是1956年并乡撤区，原来区级机构的干部上调到县以后，这种现象更加突出。有的干部因为部门工作清闲，埋怨自己是“臃肿干部”；有的干部上调后，工作情绪不高。而重要的是撤区并乡之后，乡一级的领导力量没有加强，他们的任务更重了。
