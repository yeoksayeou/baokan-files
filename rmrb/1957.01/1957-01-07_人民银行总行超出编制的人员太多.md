    The People's Bank of China Head Office has too many personnel beyond its authorized size
    Comrade Editor:
    The People's Bank of China's organization is bloated, with the current number of personnel exceeding the originally stipulated administrative quota by 332 people. Because the leadership has not paid enough attention to this problem, it has not been thoroughly resolved for a long time.
    In 1955, the Head Office had not only a large number of staff but also a large number of support personnel. Currently, there are 89 messengers, cleaners, and other support staff, accounting for 9.63% of the total number of cadres, with an average of one support staff member for every nine cadres. Each dormitory generally employs two people, one for security and one for cleaning. In the area where the General Administration Department of the Head Office is located, where there are often fewer than twenty parked vehicles, two people are also assigned to manage them. The nursery and kindergarten have a total of only 182 children, but the staff numbers 110, exceeding the authorized size by more than half.
    The Head Office's clinic currently has 30 staff members, including seven doctors and twelve nurses, in addition to general administrative personnel. However, not many people visit the clinic. For example, the gynecology department has one doctor and one nurse, but on average, fewer than seven patients visit the department each day.
    At a time when the whole country is streamlining organizations and reducing staffing levels, I hope that the leadership of the People's Bank of China Head Office can be determined to streamline its organizational structure.

### 人民银行总行超出编制的人员太多

    人民银行总行超出编制的人员太多
    编辑同志：
    中国人民银行的机构臃肿，现有人员超出原规定的行政编制人数三百三十二人。因为领导上对这个问题重视不够，长期以来没有获得彻底解决。
    1955年总行不仅工作人员多，而且所用勤杂人员也多。现有通讯员、清洁卫生员等八十九人，占干部总人数的9.63％，平均每九个干部就有一个勤杂人员。每个宿舍一般都用两个人，一个看门，一个打扫卫生。在总行行政司住的地方，经常存车不到二十辆，也设两个人来管理。托儿所和幼儿园一共只有一百八十二个儿童，工作人员就有一百一十人，超过编制一半以上。
    总行的医务所现有工作人员三十人，除一般行政管理人员外，有七个医生，十二个护士，而到医务所看病的人并不多，比如妇科设有一个医生、一个护士，但每天到该科看病的平均不到七人。
    在目前全国都在精简机构，紧缩编制的时候，我希望人民银行总行的领导上能下定决心，把自己机关的组织机构认真精简一下。
