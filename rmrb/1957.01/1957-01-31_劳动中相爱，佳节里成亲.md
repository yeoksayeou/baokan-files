    In the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative of Baicheng County, Jilin Province, which achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, more than twenty young couples will be married around the Spring Festival.

    Ren Shusheng, the secretary of the Youth League branch of this cooperative, promoted the advanced experience of planting two corn seedlings per hill last year and created the "five-touch" operation method, which saved 4,000 man-days of labor in the village's 2,700 hectares of corn planting, ensuring timely planting and achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest. He married Hu Xiuqin, the best female cooperative member in the village. They used their labor income to add three new houses.

    The father of female cooperative member Zhang Suzhi did not agree with her independent marriage to her loved one and wanted to drive her out. Zhang Suzhi said to her father, "If you want to drive me away, please give me my 1,500 work points to handle myself." Her father had to respect his daughter's opinion and agreed to their marriage.

    Many young men and women in this cooperative competed with each other in production last year. Some young women, when hoeing the ground, overtook the young men and deliberately buried love letters under the clods. The young men caught up, picked them up, and hid them in their arms. In this way, they established love from labor competitions and settled down together.

    This cooperative is located in the "eight hundred-li dry sea" area and has often suffered from droughts in the past. Cooperative Director Zong Dexiang said that in previous years, the cooperative's farmers mostly relied on government relief grain to survive in the spring. This situation has changed since the realization of cooperation last year. According to statistics, the cooperative dug 193 wells last year, and irrigating the land with well water increased the yield by 800 jin per hectare compared to dry land. The total income from agriculture and sideline occupations of the cooperative reached more than 220,000 yuan, with each labor day earning 1.8 yuan. Generally, a medium-sized labor force can earn 500 yuan a year, and all cooperative members have increased their income.

    劳动中相爱，佳节里成亲
    获得空前丰收的吉林省白城县东方红农业社，有二十多对青年男女，要在春节前后结婚。
    这个社的社员、青年团总支书记任树生在去年推广苞米一埯双株先进经验时创造了“五摸”作业法，使全村两千七百垧苞米播种工作节省了四千个人工，保证了适时播种，获得了空前丰收。他和全村劳动最好的女社员胡秀琴结婚了。她们俩人用劳动所得，添买了三间新房。
    女青年社员张素芝的父亲，不同意她和心爱的人自主结婚，要把她赶出去。张素芝向她父亲说：“如果要赶我，请把我挣的一千五百个劳动工分给我自己处理”，她父亲只好尊重女儿的意见，同意她们结婚。
    这个社的许多男女青年在去年的生产中互相比赛，有的女青年在锄地时赶到男青年的前面，故意把恋爱信埋在土块下面，男社员赶上去拾起来藏在怀里，他们就这样从劳动竞赛中建立起爱情，并且双双对对地安家立业了。
    这个社在“八百里旱海”境内，过去经常遭受旱灾。社主任宗德祥说，往年春天社里农民多半靠政府发救济粮过活。从去年实现了合作化以后，这种情况改变了。据统计：去年全社打井一百九十三眼，用井水浇地每垧比旱地增产八百斤粮食。全社农副业收入达二十二万多元，每个劳动日分一元八角，一般一个中等劳动力全年可收入五百元钱，全社社员都增加了收入。
