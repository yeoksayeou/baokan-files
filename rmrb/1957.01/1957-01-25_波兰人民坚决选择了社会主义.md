The Polish People Resolutely Chose Socialism
By Our Correspondent Xie Wenqing

	On January 20th, anyone in Warsaw who saw the voting situation could have predicted that the election results would be a complete victory for the National Unity Front led by the United Workers' Party. This is because the vast majority of voters did not hide their trust in the party of the working class. They responded to Comrade Gomulka's call: do not cross out any candidates. Many people did not even enter the voting booth but simply put their ballots directly into the ballot box. Although every voter had the right to cross out any or even all candidates, because it was a direct, free and secret election.
	Each ballot box was decorated with the red and white Polish national flag. The Polish national emblem hung on the wall behind the ballot box. Voters felt that their vote would affect the fate of their country. The election results showed that the Polish people support and trust the United Workers' Party, and the National Unity Front has achieved a complete victory. In the new parliament—the highest organ of state power—members of the United Workers' Party and left-wing progressives who support socialism hold an overwhelming majority.
	The political situation in Poland before the election was complex. The economic situation was difficult. For twelve years, especially since the Six-Year Plan, the Polish people, under the leadership of the United Workers' Party, have built an agricultural country into an industrial country with relatively complete industrial sectors and a strong national defense industry. However, some mistakes and shortcomings also occurred in the past work. After the United Workers' Party held its Eighth Plenary Session last October, it made significant efforts to consolidate its achievements and overcome the mistakes and shortcomings of the past, and received the support of the people. However, counter-revolutionary forces also took this opportunity to continue various destructive activities, attempting to achieve their heinous goal of restoring capitalism in Poland. They smeared and attacked the United Workers' Party. They attempted to use the United Workers' Party's self-criticism to write off all the achievements of the past twelve years. Factories, schools, and houses built by the People's Poland in the past twelve years are spread throughout the country, and millions of skilled workers and tens of thousands of engineers have been trained. These brilliant achievements, as obvious as the sun and the moon, are visible to anyone with eyes. The reactionary forces openly clamored for the abolition of the working-class party and the so-called "second stage of democratization" for the restoration of capitalism. They also put forward the inflammatory slogan of "100% democracy."
	As the election approached, the struggle between revolutionary and counter-revolutionary forces became even more acute. The leadership of the United Workers' Party told the people the real situation of the country and put forward its own political program. However, in addition to deception and rumors, the reactionary forces did not dare to publish their own political program, because they knew that their political program was unspeakable. According to the constitution, the State Council has the right to postpone the election again, but the United Workers' Party, which has a strong belief in its cause, decided to lead the people to hold the election immediately and considerably expanded the scope of democracy. After consultation with the parties participating in the National Unity Front, it was decided to nominate 723 candidates, allowing voters to elect 459 members of parliament from them (in the past, the number of candidates was equal to the number of members of parliament to be elected). In this way, each voter can elect three, five, or six members of parliament from five, eight, or nine candidates. In the preparation work, the most important thing was the decision of the various parties to jointly nominate candidates, that is, each party participating in the National Unity Front would nominate candidates according to the results of the consultation. The names of these candidates were printed on a unified ballot. The candidates of the United Workers' Party accounted for 53% of the unified list of candidates, the United Peasants' Party accounted for 25%, the Democratic Party accounted for 8%, and non-party and Catholics accounted for 14%. In order to conduct the campaign jointly, the parties also established consultation committees at all levels in November last year and issued a unified election program in December.
	When the election campaign began in early December last year, the counter-revolutionary forces launched a further offensive against socialism and patriotic forces, but the reactionaries still could not produce a positive program. All they could do was spread rumors and slander, while creating social unrest and anti-Soviet incidents in various parts of Poland. One of their slogans was "100% democracy," that is, counter-revolutionaries should also have democratic rights. They especially concentrated their efforts on attacking the candidates of the United Workers' Party, initially echoing the tune of "Radio Free Europe" of "don't vote," and later shouting "cross out the names of all communists except Gomulka from the ballot!" When these conspiracies were exposed, the counter-revolutionaries put forward a more vicious slogan: "Do not elect candidates who do not live in this electoral district." This slogan was likely to deceive some voters at the time, because the counter-revolutionaries said that "central-level candidates who do not live in this electoral district do not understand the local situation and requirements," and the names of the central leaders of the United Workers' Party were mostly assigned to various places as candidates. The counter-revolutionary propaganda offensive was so rampant that the National Unity Front had to launch a full counterattack immediately. Central-level candidates of the United Workers' Party, including members of the Political Bureau and secretaries of the Secretariat, went to various places to meet with their voters, answer various questions raised by the voters, and explain the party's policies to the voters. However, the counter-revolutionary forces took this opportunity to viciously attack the candidates of the United Workers' Party at the voter meetings. Unfortunately, some individuals within the United Workers' Party even opposed the party's candidates along with the counter-revolutionaries. By early January, the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution had entered a white-hot stage. At this time, the United Workers' Party and the United Peasants' Party jointly issued an agricultural program, winning over the peasants. Some individuals within the party who were engaged in anti-party activities, such as former Prime Minister Osóbka-Morawski, were either expelled from the party or disqualified as candidates. At the same time, Comrade Gomulka issued a call to the people in the final stage of the election campaign: "Do not cross out a single candidate." The proposal of this call reversed the entire situation and was a fatal blow to the reactionary propaganda. By mid-January, the counter-revolutionary offensive had reached the end of its rope. The call to "not cross out a single candidate" made the reactionary propaganda collapse. Because the election law stipulates that if no candidate is crossed out on the candidate list, it is equivalent to the first few people on the list (based on the number of members of parliament to be elected in that electoral district) being elected. Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Poland gave the Polish people great encouragement and confidence. The Polish people once again saw the representatives of 600 million friends expressing their support for them.
	"This election is an open competition between revolutionary and counter-revolutionary forces," is the common comment of many Polish comrades. The results of this election prove that in such a complex political situation, the Polish people can distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, resolutely support the United Workers' Party, and vote for the candidates of the National Unity Front. Despite the frantic agitation and sabotage of the election by domestic and foreign reactionary propaganda, the people still resolutely chose socialism.
	Among the more than 17.9 million voters, the number of participants reached 94.14% of the number of eligible voters, and the candidates of the National Unity Front received 98.4% of the votes. All the expectations of the reactionary forces came to naught. Among the more than 100 reporters who rushed from capitalist countries on the eve of the election, some were greatly disappointed. The voting on January 20th proceeded so quietly and orderly. The Polish and Czechoslovak journalists who interviewed with me suggested "having a few drinks" when the election was announced, because we had already determined that the socialist forces would achieve a complete victory at that time.
	This election is a victory for Polish socialism and a victory for the United Workers' Party. The new parliament will fully fulfill the powers conferred on it by the constitution and play a greater role in socialist construction. (Warsaw, 23rd)

    波兰人民坚决选择了社会主义
    本报记者　谢文清
    1月20日在华沙看到投票情形的人，当时就大体上已预见到选举的结果将是统一工人党领导的全国统一阵线的完全胜利。因为绝大多数选民都毫不隐瞒他们对工人阶级政党的信任。他们响应哥穆尔卡同志的号召：不划掉一个候选人。许多人根本不走进密室就把票投入票箱。虽然每个选民都有权划掉任何一个甚至全部候选人，因为这是直接、自由而秘密的选举。
    每个票箱都用波兰的红白两色国旗装饰着。票箱后面墙上挂着波兰的国徽。选民在投票时都会感到他这一票对祖国的命运的影响。选举结果表明：波兰人民拥护和信任统一工人党，全国统一阵线已获得了完全的胜利。在新的议会——国家最高权力机关中，统一工人党党员和拥护社会主义的左派进步人士占有压倒的多数。
    选举前的波兰政治情况是复杂的。经济情况是困难的。十二年来，特别是六年计划以来，波兰人民在统一工人党领导下已把一个农业国建设成为具有较完整工业部门的工业国，并拥有强大的国防工业。但是在过去的工作中也发生了一些错误和缺点。在统一工人党去年10月召开了八中全会以后，统一工人党为了巩固已得的成就和克服过去工作中的错误和缺点进行了重大的努力，并得到了人民的拥护。但是反革命势力也乘这个机会继续进行各种破坏活动，企图达到他们在波兰复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。他们污蔑和攻击统一工人党。他们企图利用统一工人党的自我批评而一笔勾销十二年来的一切成就。十二年来人民波兰建设的工厂、学校和住宅遍布全国，培养了数百万熟练工人和数万工程师。这些明显如日月的光辉成就，是有眼睛的人都看得见的。反动势力公开叫嚣要取消工人阶级政党和使资本主义复辟的所谓“民主化的第二阶段”。还提出了煽动性的“百分之百的民主”的口号。
    到了选举前夕，革命和反革命两种力量的斗争，就更加尖锐了。统一工人党领导上把国家真实情况都告诉了人民，并提出自己的政治纲领。但反动势力除了欺骗和造谣煽动外，却不敢公布自己的政纲，因为他们知道自己的政纲是见不得人的。本来按宪法规定，国务委员会有权把大选再推迟一些，可是对自己的事业具有坚强信念的统一工人党，还是决定领导人民即时举行大选，并且相当扩大了民主范围。经参加全国统一阵线的各党派协商后，决定提出七百二十三名候选人，使选民从中选举四百五十九个议员（过去是候选人同应选议员的数目相等）。这样每个选民便可从五个、八个或九个候选人中选举三个、五个或六个议员。在筹备工作中，最重要的是各党派统一提候选人的决定，即由参加全国统一阵线的各党派各自按协商结果提出候选人。这些候选人的姓名印在统一的选票上。统一工人党的候选人，在统一的候选人名单上要占53％，统一农民党占25％，民主党占8％，无党派和天主教占14％。为了共同进行竞选，各党派还在去年11月成立了各级协商委员会，并在12月发布了统一的选举纲领。
    在去年12月初选举运动开始的时候，反革命势力就进一步向社会主义和爱国力量发动攻势，但反动派仍然拿不出正面的纲领，他们所能作的只是造谣和诬蔑，同时在波兰各地制造社会骚乱和反苏事件。他们的口号之一是“百分之百的民主”，即反革命分子也应有民主权利。他们特别集中力量攻击统一工人党的候选人，起初是同“自由欧洲”电台合唱“不要去投票”的调子，后来又叫喊“从选票上划掉除哥穆尔卡以外一切共产党人的名字！”当这些阴谋被揭穿后，反革命分子就提出了一个更毒辣的口号：“不要选未住在本选区的候选人”，这个口号当时很可能欺骗一部分选民，因为反革命分子说什么“未住在本选区的中央级候选人不了解地方情况和要求”，而统一工人党中央负责人的名字却大部分分配在各地作为候选人。反革命的宣传攻势如此猖狂，使得全国统一阵线不得不立刻发起全力的反攻。统一工人党中央级的候选人，包括政治局委员、书记处书记等，都分赴各地同自己的选民会见，解答选民提出的各种问题，向选民解释党的政策。但反革命势力就利用这个机会在选民会见会上恶毒地攻击统一工人党的候选人。可惜的是在统一工人党内也竟然有个别人同反革命分子一起反对党的候选人。到1月上旬，革命和反革命的斗争，就进入到白热化的阶段。这时统一工人党和统一农民党又共同发布了农业纲领，争取了农民。党内个别进行反党活动的人，如前总理奥索布卡—摩拉夫斯基等，有的被开除党籍，有的被撤销了候选人资格。同时哥穆尔卡同志在选举运动的最后阶段又向人民发出了“不要划掉一个候选人”的号召，这个号召的提出扭转了整个形势，是给反动宣传的致命的一击。到1月中旬，反革命的攻势已是强弩之末了。“不划掉一个候选人”的号召，使反动宣传一蹶不振。因为选举法规定，如果候选人名单上未划掉一个候选人，就等于名单上的前几人（以该选区应选几个议员为准）当选了。周恩来总理的访波，又使波兰人民得到了很大的鼓舞和信心。波兰人民又一次看到了六亿朋友的代表对他们表示的支持。
    “这次选举是革命力量同反革命的公开竞赛”，这是许多波兰同志的共同评语。这次选举的结果证明：在如此复杂的政治局势中，波兰人民能分清敌我，坚决拥护统一工人党，投票选举全国统一阵线的候选人。尽管国内外的反动宣传声嘶力竭地进行鼓动，破坏选举，但人民仍然坚决选择了社会主义。
    一千七百九十多万选民中，参加投票人数达到合格选民数目的94.14％，全国统一阵线的候选人得到了98.4％的选票，统一工人党中央一级的候选人全部当选。反动势力的一切期望都成了泡影。选举前夕从资本主义国家赶来的一百多个记者中，有些人兴头大减。1月20日的投票，是那样安静而井然有序地进行。同我一起采访的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克记者们都建议在选举揭晓时“干它几杯”，因为当时我们已断定了社会主义力量将获得完全的胜利。
    这次选举是波兰社会主义的胜利，是统一工人党的胜利。新的议会将充分履行宪法赋予它的职权，为社会主义建设发挥更大的作用。（23日、华沙）
