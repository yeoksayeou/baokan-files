    Achievements of Ancient Chinese Pharmaceutics
    Hu Changhong
    Pharmaceutics is an important part of medical science and also a major professional course in modern pharmaceutical education. It studies the creation of dosage forms used in medical prevention and treatment and their preparation methods, so that drugs can exert the greatest effect in treatment. The great achievements of ancient China in pharmaceutics not only reflect the level of ancient Chinese medicine and culture, but also have a great impact on the current medical and health undertakings of the Chinese people.
    In ancient Chinese medical science, the origin of pharmaceutics was extremely early. From the earliest medical literature in China—"Suwen" and "Lingshu Jing"—there were already records of the preparation and application of decoctions, pills, powders, medicated wines, drinks, ointments, and other dosage forms. The earliest Chinese materia medica, "Shen Nong's Herbal Classic," records: "Medicinal properties are suitable for pills, powders, boiling in water, soaking in wine, frying into ointment, and some can be used in combination, and some cannot be added to decoctions or wine, all according to the properties of the medicine, and must not be violated." This shows that ancient China had already created various suitable medicines according to the nature of the drugs and medical needs, and had already achieved brilliant achievements in pharmaceutics.
    With the development of the motherland's medical science, dosage forms used in medical prevention and treatment have been continuously created and invented, scattered in ancient Chinese medical literature, especially in the medical prescription classics of past dynasties. The most complete collection of these is the "Compendium of Materia Medica" written by the great Chinese physician Li Shizhen (1518-1593 AD) in the Ming Dynasty. The book contains 1,892 kinds of medicines, including 11,096 empirical prescriptions from previous dynasties before the end of the Ming Dynasty in the appended prescriptions section. From the various medicines created throughout the dynasties collected in his book, we know that many of the various medicines used in modern medicine were invented in ancient China and have detailed preparation methods.
    Ancient China created various medicines, such as internal medicines, external medicines, and medicines for the five sense organs, and there are many items. The various dosage forms currently used in medical prevention and treatment, except for injections created in recent times and compression tablet machines created after the invention of machines, were all completely created and invented in ancient China. Moreover, the preparation of various medicines has been continuously improved and improved from medical practice since ancient times, and from the perspective of modern pharmaceutics, they all conform to scientific operating principles. The more prominent ones are:
    In internal medicines, for example, in the preparation of decoctions (medicinal soups), preparation operations such as decocting first and adding later, and re-decocting in a heavy pot (low-temperature concentration in water) were used early on to avoid damage and loss of the drug due to excessive and high heat, and there were also excellent preparation methods such as removing the residue and adding honey for flavoring. On the basis of further concentration of the decoction, the extract was created and invented. Not only are there water immersion, wine immersion, and the same method of extracting with water and extracting with alcohol as described in the current Chinese Pharmacopoeia, but also there are records of using raw medicine to mash juice, filter it, and boil it into ointment, similar to the advanced preparation method adopted by the Soviet Union of squeezing fresh raw medicine juice and evaporating it into extract. In the preparation of mixtures, various suspensions were used early on, and the application and curative effects of ancient Chinese medicines were combined. In the preparation of emulsions, there were not only the "Bian Que oil preparation method" with mechanically operated emulsions, but also emulsions using protein as an emulsifier, and the creation of seed emulsions widely used in Soviet medical treatment today. In the preparation of medicated wines, in addition to various preparation methods of brewing wine with medicine and soaking and boiling with wine, there were early extraction operations similar to the preparation of tinctures in the current Pharmacopoeia. In the preparation of powders, the invention of the water flying method has existed since ancient times in the crushing operation, and the excellent operation method of "repeatedly pounding and sieving until the color and texture are the same" in the mixing operation ensures the quality of the powder preparation. In particular, the creation of mian nang ji (面囊剂, flour-wrapped medicine) in the powder with malodorous and irritating drugs wrapped in flour for oral administration can be regarded as a major enlightenment in pharmaceutics, which is completely the same as the principle of modern capsule application. Other creations such as pills were not only invented extremely early in ancient Chinese medicine but also widely used. The selection of various binders and the invention of coating in the preparation of pills are completely the same as modern pharmaceutical operating principles. Moreover, pills have been sealed with wax shells since ancient times, which is an excellent creation for storage stability. If we can study the great medical science achievements of ancient times, we can gain great inspiration.
    In external medicines and medicines for the five sense organs, for example, in the preparation of external powders, chemical preparations prepared by alchemy methods and corrosive powders prepared by boiling mineral ash and wheat straw ash into caustic alkali were created very early. In the preparation of suppositories, various suppositories were created very early using lard, mutton fat, beeswax, and honey as the matrix. Whether in the creation of the dosage form or its preparation, there were outstanding creations. In the medicines for the five sense organs, the creation of tongue powders for local absorption was used early on, and as eye drops are sensitive to the sensation of the eye mucosa and cannot tolerate stimulation, there are early records of using clean water such as snow water for preparation, which meets the requirements for eye use. In the ancient use of fumigation agents, not only were they used for the treatment of patients who could not use needles (acupuncture) or medicine (oral medicine), but also early prescriptions included records of preventive medicines for burning smoke to remove mosquitoes and fumigating clothes to remove lice. The preparation of medicines closely integrates the medical thought of prevention first in ancient China. In the preparation of external and ophthalmic ointments, not only oil-based matrices are used, but also cream matrices are used to help the absorption of the main drug. This outstanding achievement in pharmaceutics is truly a glorious page in ancient Chinese medicine and science. Lard, mutton fat, beeswax, sesame oil, etc., are still included in the current Chinese Pharmacopoeia, and a beeswax-sesame oil mixed matrix is also included as a single ointment, which is completely the same as that used in ancient Chinese prescriptions, inheriting the excellent Chinese medical and cultural heritage, which also shows that many of these heritages still have great practical significance today. Other preparations such as plasters (gaoyao) have been prepared in China since ancient times using lead plasters (lead soap matrix), resin plasters (resin soap matrix) and mixed matrix plasters. In the preparation operation, attention was also paid to strictly observing the heat and frying until the water dripped into beads without breaking up to ensure complete saponification. In the prescription, drugs with a large specific gravity such as cinnabar and realgar are added and mixed in when the plaster is formed to prevent precipitation: aromatic drugs such as borneol and musk are added when the plaster is about to cool to prevent volatilization, all of which are operating methods that conform to scientific principles. The creation of hard plasters for external treatment of carbuncles and internal treatment of rheumatism and other diseases in ancient medical treatment, as well as its scientific preparation methods, have a unique creativity in ancient Chinese medicine and science.
    In addition, ancient China not only invented chemical preparations prepared by sublimation and refining 3,000 years ago, but also created tooth filling medicines made of white tin, silver foil, and mercury alloy in the Tang Dynasty. These achievements have extremely important significance for the development of world medical science. In the Northern Song Dynasty, starting from the ninth year of Xining of Emperor Shenzong, the Taiyi Bureau's Familiar Medicine Institute was established to print and distribute the "Tai Medicine Bureau Prescription," and later it was revised into the "Taiping Benefit the People and Rescue Bureau Prescription" during the Daguan period. This medical prescription classic was officially issued as a criterion for drug manufacturing, unifying the preparation methods of pills, powders, plasters, elixirs, and other medicines. This shows that ancient China had unified standards and norms in drug manufacturing, and there were further achievements in drug production, and at the same time, it reflects the outstanding contributions made by China since ancient times in drug manufacturing to the people's health undertakings.
    As for other achievements related to pharmaceutics, there are many records in the Compendium of Materia Medica. These achievements need to be further sorted out and promoted.
    Finally, it is worth mentioning that according to modern research, the earliest Chinese medical literature—"Suwen" and "Lingshu Jing"—are works of the Warring States period, which at least reflect the medical culture of the Zhou and Yin Shang dynasties in China. Therefore, the origin of the various medicines recorded in them should be earlier than the date of writing. The era of Gelin, who we have always called the ancestor of world pharmaceutics, was only equivalent to the late Eastern Han Dynasty in China. This makes us proud of the rich and outstanding medical and cultural heritage of the motherland. We must work hard to study, inherit, and carry forward it, so as to enrich and improve the existing level of medical science and make better and greater contributions to the people's health undertakings in China.

    我国古代药剂学的成就
    胡长鸿
    药剂学是医药科学中重要的一环，也是现代药学教育中主要的专业课程。它是研究医疗预防上用药剂型的创制和它的制备方法，使药物在治疗中能发挥最大的效用。我国古代在药剂学上的伟大成就，不仅反映了我国古代的医药文化水平，同时对目前我国人民的医药保健事业有很大的作用。
    在我国古代医药科学中，药剂学的创始是极早的。从祖国最早的医药文献——素问和灵枢经中，早就有了汤、丸、散、醴、饮、膏等药剂制备和应用的记载。在我国最早的本草著作——神农本草经中载有：“药性有宜丸者、宜散者、宜水煮者、宜酒渍者、宜膏煎者，亦有一物兼宜者，亦有不可入汤酒者，并随药性，不得违越。”这都说明了我国古代即根据药物的性质和医疗上的需要创用了各种适宜的药剂，在药剂学上早就有着辉煌的成就。
    随着祖国医药科学的发展，在医疗预防中用药剂型不断的创制发明，散见于我国古代医药文献中，尤以在历代医药方剂典籍中收载最多。而其中搜罗最为完备的，首推我国明代伟大的医药学家李时珍（公元1518—1593）所著的本草纲目。全书收载药品一千八百九十二种，其中附方一项，网罗了我国明末以前历代的经验方剂达一万一千零九十六条之多。从他这部著作中所汇集的历代创用的各种药剂，使我们知道现代在医药上采用的各种药剂，很多在我国古代早已发明，并有着详细的制备方法。
    我国古代创用了各种药剂，如内服药剂、外用及五官科用药剂中就有许多项目。目前医疗预防上应用的各种用药剂型，仅仅除了近世才创用的注射剂和机器发明后才创用的压制片机外，其余在我国古代都早已完备地创制和发明了。而且在各种药剂的制备上，自古就从医疗实践中不断地改进和提高，从现代药剂学观点看来，也都符合于科学操作原理。其中比较突出的有这些：
    在内服药剂中，例如煎剂（汤药）的制备上早就根据药物的性质有先煎后入和重釜再煎（隔水低温浓缩）等制备操作，避免药物受热过久和过高的破坏损失，也有去滓入蜜作为矫味用的优良制备方法。在煎剂进一步浓缩的基础上，创制发明了浸膏剂。不仅有水浸、酒浸和我国目前药典所载用水浸出、用酒精浸出相同的制法，并且有用生药捣汁滤净熬膏，类似苏联采用生鲜生药榨汁蒸发为浸膏的先进制备方法的记载。在合剂的制备中，早有了各种混悬剂的应用，在我国古代药剂中应用并兼具有疗效的特点。在乳剂的制备中，不仅有“扁鹊油剂法”借机械操作的乳剂，也有用蛋白作乳化剂的乳剂，且有目前苏联医疗上广用的种子乳剂的创制。在酒剂的制备中，除了有和药酿酒及用酒浸煮的各种制法外，且在浸出操作上早有与目前药典制备酊剂类同的制法。在散剂的制备中，其中粉碎操作自古就有水飞法的发明，在混合操作中有“反复捣筛至色理和同”的优良操作方法，保证了散剂制备的质量。尤以散剂中具有恶臭及刺激性药物用面裹服作面囊剂的创始，在药剂学上可以算是一大启明，与现代应用胶囊剂的原理完全相同。其它如丸剂的创制在我国古代医疗上不仅发明极早且应用极广。在丸剂制备上各种炼合剂的选用和包衣的发明，都和现代药剂学操作原理完全相同。而且丸剂自古就采用蜡壳固封的方法，对贮存的安定性上有着卓越的创造。我们如能很好的钻研古代伟大的医药科学成就，当能获得极大的启发作用。
    在外用及五官科用药剂中，例如外用散剂的制备，很早就有用炼丹方法制备的化学制剂和用矿灰、麦杆灰熬炼为苛性硷类的腐蚀用散剂的创制。在栓剂的制备上很早就用豚脂、羊脂、蜂蜡、蜂蜜作为基质，创用各种栓剂，无论在用药剂型的创始和它的制备上都有着卓越的创造。在五官科用药剂中，早就采用了舌用散剂作局部吸收用药的创制，且如滴眼剂由于眼粘膜感觉灵敏，不耐刺激，早有选用雪水等洁净水制备的记载，符合于眼用的要求。在古代熏烟剂的创用中，非但在不能用针（针灸）药（服药）的病患作为治疗用，且在古方中早有了烧烟去蚊和熏衣去虱的预防用药剂的记载，在药剂制备中密切地贯串着我国古代以预防为主的医学思想。在外用和眼用软膏剂的制备中，不仅采用油脂性基质，并且采用乳膏剂基质，有助于主药的吸收，这种药剂学上的卓越成就，实在是我国古代医药科学中辉煌的一页。其中如豚脂、羊脂、蜂蜡、麻油等在目前我国药典上都仍然把它收载在内，同时也收载了蜂蜡麻油混合基质作为单软膏，与我国古方中所用的完全相同，继承了我国优秀的医药文化遗产，从这里也说明了这些遗产中许多至今尚有着极大的实用意义。其它像硬膏剂（膏药）的制备，我国自古即采用了铅硬膏（铅肥皂基质）、树脂硬膏（树脂皂基质）和混合基质的硬膏。在制备操作上，也早就注意谨守火候，煎至滴水成珠不散，使皂化完全。在处方中有朱砂、雄黄等比重大的药物，在膏成的时候，投入搅和，用来防止沉聚：有龙脑、麝香等芳香性药物，在膏将冷的时候投入，用来防止挥散，都是符合于科学原理的操作方法。古代医疗上外治痈疽，内治风湿诸病内外兼治的硬膏剂的创用，以及它的科学的制备方法，在我国古代医药科学上更有着独特的创造性。
    此外，我国古代不仅在距今三千年前已发明了升炼制备的化学制剂，且在唐代已创用了白锡和银薄及水银合成的汞合金的齿用填充药剂。这些成就对世界医药科学的发展上，具有极重大的意义。在北宋时代神宗熙宁九年起曾设太医局熟药所，印行太药局方，以后在大观年间修订为太平惠民和济局方，这一部医药方剂典籍，当时官颁作为制药准绳，统一了丸、散、膏、丹等药剂的制备方法。这说明了我国古代在制药上曾有着统一的准则和规范，在药剂的生产上有着进一步的成就，同时也反映了我国自古以来在制药工作中，对人民保健事业所作的卓越贡献。
    至于其他有关药剂学方面的成就载在本草纲目的还很多。这些成就，都有待我们进一步的整理发扬。
    最后，值得提出的是根据现代考据，我国最早的医药文献——素问和灵枢经是战国时代的作品，它至少反映出我国周代和殷商时代的医药文化，因此其中所载各种药剂的创始当更早于所著年代。我们一向沿称为世界药剂学鼻祖的格林的时代，仅仅相当于我国后汉末年时期。使我们对祖国丰富卓越的医药文化遗产引以自豪。我们要努力学习、继承和发扬，以丰富和提高现有医药科学水平，使我国医药科学在我国人民保健事业中作出更好、更多的贡献。
