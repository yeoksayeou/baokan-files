    The Master of the Mine
    ——Remembering Miner Wang Guanhai
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Fang Chen
    Among the many model figures at the Tangshan Mine of the Kailuan Coal Mine, there is one who is particularly praised – Wang Guanhai.
    He is an underground transport worker who has worked at the Tangshan Mine for over ten years. People say he is as thrifty in the mine as he is at home, cherishing every nail and piece of wood.
    Since the mine launched the campaign to increase production and practice economy in March of the year before last, Wang Guanhai, whether underground or above ground, always picked up any old pit props or bolts he saw. Every time he went down the mine, he always carried an old burlap sack, and picked up waste steel and old machine parts he saw in the tunnels and put them in the sack. Whenever he had a moment to spare underground, he never wasted it. Every time he loaded coal from the chute into the coal carts, while other transport workers sat aside chatting, he used those ten or so minutes to pick up discarded waste materials underground. Therefore, every time he came up from the mine after his shift, he carried a burlap sack full of old materials, and he has not stopped doing this every day since March of the year before last. Among them, the waste steel and old machine parts he picked up alone amounted to more than 78,000 catties.
    Once, when he passed the No. 8 Eight-Eight-Four-Six coal mining face underground, he discovered a pile of discarded electric chute chain plates, iron base plates, and signal bells under the air duct. However, he didn't have a sack with him at the time, and his cotton coat pockets couldn't hold them. He was afraid of delaying production if he went back to get one, so in the end, he took off his cotton coat and raincoat, wrapped two large packages, and carried them all the way to the main roadway to be hoisted to the surface.
    Another time, he had already finished his shift, and people were rushing to take the first cage up the mine. At this time, he saw that the ditch in Eight-Lane was blocked by coal slurry, so he found an iron bar to clear the ditch. He heard a sound inside and thought: it would be such a pity if waste steel was lost here. So he took off his rubber shoes and went into the icy black ditch to scoop with his hands, and as a result, he retrieved five eight-pound old hammers, two or three sections of hanging chains from coal carts, and old iron shovel heads.
    Wang Guanhai often said, "You can't boil water if you're short even one piece of firewood, and a machine can't be used if it's missing even one screw." Therefore, he regards every small piece of equipment as very important. As long as he walks into the mining area, he always looks left and right, and picks up even the smallest things he sees. The west side of the conference room in the underground transportation area is an open space that used to be a garbage and slag dumping site. Every time he went to a meeting, he would take advantage of the time before people arrived to pick up waste steel in the garbage pile. If he saw small parts, he would pick them up and put them in his pocket; if he saw large pieces of scrap steel, he would pile them up. Last year, he picked up four or five hundred catties of waste steel and small parts in this one place alone. Many of these old materials, after processing, have been used as new materials.
    Wang Guanhai's actions to protect national property have educated many employees of the Tangshan Mine. Since last year, more than 130 advanced individuals like Wang Guanhai, who cherish national property, have emerged in the mine's underground transportation area alone.

    矿山的主人
    ——记矿工王官海
    新华社记者　方辰
    在开滦煤矿唐山矿的许多模范人物中，有一位特别受人赞扬的人——王官海。
    他是在唐山矿做了十多年工的井下运输工人，人们都说他在矿里和在家过日子一样俭省，对一钉一木都非常珍惜。
    自从前年3月这个矿开展增产节约以来，王官海不论是在井下或在井上，只要看见有一截旧坑木，一个螺丝帽，都要拣起来。他每次下井的时候总是带着一条旧麻袋，在巷道里看见了废钢铁，旧机器零件就拾起来装在麻袋里。他在井下只要有一点空也不白白过去，每次从溜煤咀往煤车里放煤的时候，别的运输工人都是坐在一旁聊天，他就利用这十几分钟的空隙拣一些丢弃在井下的废器材。因此，他每次下班从井下上来的时候，都背着满满一麻袋旧料，从前年3月到现在一天也没有中断过。其中光是他拣的废钢铁和机器旧零件，就有七万八千多斤。
    有一次，他在井下路过八道巷八八四六采煤掌子面，发现在风筒底下扔着一堆作废了的电溜子链子板、铁底板，还有信号铃等旧器材。可是当时没有带着麻袋，棉袄口袋里又装不下，回来再拿吧又怕耽误生产，最后他脱下棉袄和雨衣包了两大包，一直背到大巷里提升到地面上来。
    还有一次，已经下了班，人们都赶着坐头趟罐上井。这时他看见八道巷里的水沟被煤泥堵住了，就找了个铁条来扒通水沟，听见里面有响声，他想：要是废钢铁丢在这里面多可惜。于是他就脱下胶鞋到冰凉的黑水沟里去用手涝，结果从里面捞出来了五个八磅重的旧锤、两三截煤车上的挂链和旧铁锹头。
    王官海经常说：“做饭缺一根柴也烧不开锅，机器短一个螺丝钉也不能用。”因此，他把任何一个小器材都看得非常重要。只要他一走进矿区，总是左瞅瞅右瞅瞅，见到一点小东西就拾起来。井下运输区的会议室西边一片空地，是过去堆垃圾倒碴滓的地方，他每次去开会趁人们还没有到齐的时候，就在垃圾堆里拣废钢铁，见到小零件，就拾起来放进自己的口袋里；见到大块废钢废铁，就拾成堆。去年光在这一个地方他就拣了四、五百斤废钢铁和小零件。其中有很多旧器材经过加工以后，已经当作新料用了。
    王官海的这种爱护国家财产的行动，教育了唐山矿的许多职工。去年以来，光是这个矿的井下运输区里，就出现了一百三十多名像王官海那样爱护国家财产的先进人物。
