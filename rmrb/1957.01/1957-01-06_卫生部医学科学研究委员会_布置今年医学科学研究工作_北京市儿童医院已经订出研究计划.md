Ministry of Health Medical Science Research Committee
    Deploys This Year's Medical Science Research Work
    Beijing Children's Hospital Has Already Established a Research Plan

    This newspaper reports that the Ministry of Health Medical Science Research Committee, according to the State Council Science Research Planning Committee's drafted 12-year Scientific and Technological Long-Range Plan, has drafted a preliminary outline of the 1957 annual plan. The content includes: research on the prevention and treatment of diseases that are most harmful to the people; research on new antibiotics, drugs, and medical equipment; summarizing and promoting traditional Chinese medicine theories and experiences; comprehensive measures for occupational health and labor protection, as well as research on the prevention and treatment of major occupational diseases; and research on environmental hygiene, nutrition, and physical activities. In addition, there is also research on basic theoretical issues such as anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, and pathology. This initial draft was sent to relevant higher medical schools, research institutions, and medical prevention units across the country in early November of last year to widely solicit opinions. The Ministry of Health will also convene a plenary meeting of the Medical Science Research Committee in February to discuss and review the topics proposed by various units in order to conduct medical science research work in a planned manner.

    The Medical Science Research Committee of Beijing Children's Hospital has formulated the 1957 medical science research plan and topics. The topics planned for research by the hospital are common diseases that pose the greatest threat to children's health, such as: clinical analysis of neonatal pneumonia, clinical analysis of toxic dyspepsia, the therapeutic effect of traditional Chinese medicine on epidemic "type B" encephalitis, the therapeutic effect and observation of acupuncture on infantile paralysis, etc. In addition, research topics have also been established for various departments. Research on the physiological standards of children in China is also one of the hospital's key research topics in 1957.

    The hospital's 1957 scientific research plan was formulated under the personal leadership of President Zhu Futang, Vice President Xu Zhengwen, Wu Ruiping, and others. Professors Deng Jin?, Zhang Weixun, Meng Guangjun, and others from the hospital participated in the discussion. Recently, the hospital's Medical Science Research Committee has held continuous meetings, in addition to repeatedly studying the topics of medical science research, it also discussed how to allocate research time and the supply of books and materials; and formed grassroots groups to conduct specific research in groups; in addition, it is stipulated that group meetings will be held once a month in the future to check the progress of work, discuss research methods, exchange experiences, and conduct free discussions. The Standing Committee of the Hospital Research Committee also decided to hold a coordination meeting once a week to solve the difficult problems encountered in the research.

    卫生部医学科学研究委员会
    布置今年医学科学研究工作
    北京市儿童医院已经订出研究计划
    本报讯　卫生部医学科学研究委员会根据国务院科学研究规划委员会所制定的科学技术12年远景规划（草案）已拟订出1957年的年度计划纲要初稿。内容包括有：防治危害人民最严重的疾病的研究；研究新的抗生素、药物和医学器材；总结和发扬中医理论和经验；劳动卫生、劳动保护的综合措施以及防治主要职业病的研究；环境卫生、营养和体育活动的研究。此外，还有关于解剖、生理、生化、病理等基本理论问题的研究。这个初稿已于去年11月上旬发给全国有关的高等医药学校、研究机构和医疗预防单位，广泛征求意见。卫生部并将在2月召开医学科学研究委员会的全体委员会议，讨论并审核各单位提出的题目，以便有计划地进行医学科学的研究工作。
    北京市儿童医院医学科学研究委员会已制定1957年的医学科学研究计划和题目。该院计划研究的题目都是常见的、也是危害儿童健康最大的疾病，如：新生儿肺炎的临床分析、中毒性消化不良的临床分析、流行性“乙型”脑炎的中医疗效、针灸对小儿麻痹症的疗效和观察等，另外也订出了各科室的研究题目。对我国儿童生理标准的研究，也是该院1957年重点研究专题之一。
    该院1957年的科学研究计划是在诸福棠、徐政闻、吴瑞萍等正副院长的亲自领导下制定的。院内邓金?、张炜逊、孟广均等教授都参加了讨论。最近该院医学科学研究委员会曾连续召开会议，除对医学科学研究的题目反复进行研究以外，还讨论了如何分配研究时间和图书资料的供应等问题；并组成了基层小组，分组具体进行研究；此外还规定今后每月召开小组会一次，检查工作进行情况，讨论研究方法，交流经验，并展开自由讨论。该院研究委员会常务委员会并决定每星期开碰头会一次，解决在研究中所遇到的困难问题。
