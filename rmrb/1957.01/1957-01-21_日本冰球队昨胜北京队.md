    Japanese Ice Hockey Team Defeats Beijing Team Yesterday

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Japanese ice hockey team, relying on their skillful techniques, defeated the Beijing team by a score of 20-2 last night on the ice rink of the East Chang'an Street Sports Field in Beijing.

    At the start of the match, in the first eleven minutes of the first period, the Beijing team defended very tightly, causing many of the Japanese team's attacks to fail. The Japanese team's forwards used clever cross-covering tactics to press the Beijing team's goal. Number 3, Miyazaki Yoshihiro, cut in diagonally, lightly tapping the puck to the right; Number 5, Monji Takashi, followed up perfectly, swinging his stick sharply, and the puck flew into the goal, opening the scoring. Soon after, Number 18, Sakurai Shun, who was good at shooting cold shots, suddenly hit another goal for the Japanese team. At this time, the Beijing team launched a full counterattack, with Number 6, Wang Yingfu, and Number 5, Cui Yichang, taking advantage of the opponent's empty defense in the back, advancing side by side. Cui shot forcefully near the goal, and it went in! In the first period, the Japanese team led by 3-1. From the second period onwards, the Beijing team gradually showed signs of weakening, their speed slowed down, and they could not control the puck. The Japanese team became more and more courageous as they fought, scoring repeatedly. They scored nine goals in this period. In the last period, although the Beijing team scored another goal, they also conceded eight goals, resulting in a defeat of 2-20.

    The Beijing team lost because of poor basic skills; when dribbling, the body was too far from the puck, which was often snatched away by the opponent; and the team's cooperation was not good enough. The Japanese team's performance can be described as small and exquisite, brave and good at fighting.

    日本冰球队昨胜北京队
    本报讯　日本冰球队队员凭着熟练的技巧，昨天晚上在北京东长安街体育场的冰场上，以二十比二胜北京队。
    比赛开始，第一节的头十一分钟内，北京队防守很严密，使日本队的多次进攻遭到失败。日本队前锋运用巧妙的交叉掩护紧逼北京队大门。只见三号宫崎宜广斜线切入，把球轻敲右侧；五号门司尧正好跟上，挥棍急叩，球飞进了大门，首开纪录。不久，日本队善于射冷箭的十八号樱井俊又突然命中一球。这时北京队全力反攻，六号王应辅和五号崔颐昌乘对方后防空虚的机会，一左一右，双骑挺进。崔近门力射，进去了！第一节日本队以三比一领先。第二节起，北京队渐现不支，速度慢，球也控制不住。日本队则愈战愈勇，连连得分。这一节他们得了九个球。最后一节北京队虽又中一球，但也失了八球，结果以二比二十败阵。
    北京队输在基本技术差，运球时身体离球过远，常被对方抢走；队的合作也不够好。日本队的表演，可称得小巧玲珑，慓悍善战。
