    Confidential Documents on the Street
    To the Editor:
    In the streets of Lanzhou, various confidential documents are often found. This phenomenon shows that although many of our national cadres have received security education, their vigilance is still very poor.
    Zhang Guorui, of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee, lost a copy of the Commercial Department Party Group's request report to the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Committee's draft reply on November 27 last year. Later, it was picked up by the masses and handed over to the Provincial Committee.
    The Secretary of the CPC Lanzhou Donggang District Committee brought back three internal Party documents from the Municipal Committee on November 12 last year, and also lost the documents on the street. As a result, the masses picked them up and handed them over to the Public Security Bureau.
    Lu Wenkui, a cadre from the Organization Department of the CPC Gansu Wuzhong State Committee working in Lanzhou, lost all relevant cadre materials and Party committee introduction letters when he went out.
    Zhu Xiangmin of the Aviation Photography Team of the Ministry of Geology picked up an important military aerial map from the Lanzhou Airport Meteorological Observatory at 9:30 am on December 14 last year, and casually inserted it into his pants pocket, and then lost it on the way back.
    Similar examples can be cited. It can be seen that there are still many people who are negligent. This should be paid attention to in order to strengthen security education for cadres.

### 街头上的机密文件

    街头上的机密文件编辑同志：
    在兰州市的街头上，常常拾到各种各样机密文件。这种现象说明我们许多国家干部虽然都经过保密教育，可是警惕性还是很差。
    中共甘肃省委统战部张国瑞同志去年11月27日在路上丢失了商业厅党组给省委的请示报告一份及省委批示的底稿。后来由群众拾到交给省委。
    中共兰州东岗区委书记去年11月12日从市委带回三个党内文件，也把文件丢在街上了，结果也是群众拾到后送交公安局的。
    中共甘肃省吴忠州委会组织部派在兰州工作的干部陆文魁，出外时竟将全部有关干部材料和党委介绍信遗失了。
    地质部航空摄影队朱向民去年12月14日上午九时半从兰州飞机场气象台取了一个重要的军用航空图，随手插在裤袋里，于是在回来的路上丢失了。
    类似这样的例子还可以举出一些。可见麻痹大意的人还是不少。这一点应该引起注意，以加强对干部的保密教育。
                （刘立中）
