    Rhapsody
    My face is so clean, and yet you say it's covered in dust. Criticism and self-criticism, alas, it's such a headache! It's best to divide the labor and be responsible for our own parts, so as to avoid endless entanglements. Leaders: responsible for criticism. Those led: responsible for self-criticism!

    狂想曲我的脸这么干净，居然还说我满面灰尘。批评与自我批评，唉，实在令人头疼！最好分工负责，免得纠缠不清，领导：负责批评，被领导：负责自我批评！
