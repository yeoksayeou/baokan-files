Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the Eisenhower Middle East plan on the 7th, stating that this plan, which requests authorization to send troops to the Middle East and provide "economic aid" to the Middle East, is a continuation of a series of steps taken by the United States over the past many years. In this regard, Dulles listed the "Truman Doctrine" of 1947, the "Marshall Plan" of 1948, the North Atlantic Treaty signed in 1949, the war of aggression against Korea launched in 1950, the Southeast Asia Treaty signed in 1954, and the 1955 request to Congress to authorize the government to use force in the Taiwan region, etc. He said that although these steps differed in form, they had the "most fundamental common ground."

When discussing this new plan to control the Middle East by force, Dulles repeated the views in Eisenhower's message, emphasizing the importance of the Middle East region to Western countries. He also repeated the fabrication of so-called "countries controlled by international communism" launching "open armed aggression" in the Middle East, saying that if Congress does not approve this plan, it would be equivalent to giving the Middle East region to the communists. However, under questioning from the congressmen, Dulles also said that he currently had no reason to believe that Middle Eastern countries such as Syria, Egypt, or Jordan were already under "communist control," and that the United States currently had no concrete evidence to show that a "communist attack on the Middle East" was "imminent."

When talking about the relationship between the new plan and the United Nations, Dulles said that if the United States believes that the United Nations and the Security Council cannot take action because of the Soviet veto, the United States is prepared to use force in the Middle East on its own.

One congressman asked Dulles whether the U.S. government's plan would increase tensions in the Middle East, to which Dulles replied, "Tensions with the Soviet Union will at least increase temporarily."

Dulles stated that the planned "aid" to the Middle East would focus on military aspects, such as providing money to some Middle Eastern countries to establish "security forces" to suppress the people and national independence movements. He also said that the planned "economic aid" projects do not include funding Egypt to build the Aswan Dam.

Dulles said that after Eisenhower announced his Middle East plan, the initial reaction of Arab countries was "unfavorable." He expressed the hope that these countries would "welcome" the plan.

Dulles said that the U.S. government had not discussed this plan with Britain and France in advance, and so far, no official response to the U.S. plan has been received from these two countries.

    杜勒斯就侵略中东计划作证
    承认同美国历次侵略计划有共同点
    新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯7日在众议院外交委员会上就艾森豪威尔中东计划作证说，这个要求授权能出兵中东和给中东“经济援助”的计划，是美国过去多年来采取的一系列步骤的继续。在这方面，杜勒斯列举出1947年的“杜鲁门主义”、1948年的“马歇尔计划”、1949年缔结的北大西洋公约、1950年发动的侵略朝鲜战争、1954年缔结的东南亚条约以及1955年要求国会授权政府在台湾地区使用武力等等，他说，这些步骤虽然方式有所不同，然而却有着“最根本的共同点”。
    杜勒斯在谈论这个企图用武力来控制中东的新计划时，重复了艾森豪威尔咨文里的观点，强调中东地区对西方国家的重要性。他也重复了所谓“由国际共产主义控制的国家”在中东发动“公开武装侵略”的揑造，他说，如果国会不批准这个计划，就等于把中东地区送给共产党。但是，在议员们的质问下，杜勒斯又说，他目前并没有理由认为像叙利亚、埃及或者约旦这些中东国家已经处在“共产党的控制下”，美国目前也没有任何具体证据，能够说明“共产党对中东的攻击”已经“在望”。
    杜勒斯在谈到新计划同联合国的关系时说，如果美国认为联合国和安全理事会因为苏联的否决而不能采取行动，美国就准备径自在中东使用武力。
    有议员问杜勒斯，美国政府的计划是否会增加中东的紧张局势，杜勒斯回答说，“对苏联的紧张关系至少会暂时增加”。
    杜勒斯表示，计划中的对中东的“援助”将着重军事方面，例如出钱给中东一些国家建立镇压人民和民族独立运动的“安全部队”。他还说，计划中的“经济援助”项目里不包括出钱资助埃及修建阿斯旺水坝。
    杜勒斯说，在艾森豪威尔发表他的中东计划以后，阿拉伯国家的初步反应是“不利”的。他表示希望这些国家会“欢迎”这个计划。
    杜勒斯说，美国政府没有事先和英法讨论过这个计划，到目前为止，还没有收到这两个国家对美国计划的官方反应。
