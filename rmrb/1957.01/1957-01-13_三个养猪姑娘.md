In the pig farm of Taiyuan Agricultural Cooperative in Jingxian County, Anhui Province, there are three 17-year-old female feeders, all of whom are members of the Communist Youth League.

Young girls raising sows was still a new thing in the local area. According to the old views of the local farmers, raising sows was not honorable; only old and helpless people raised sows. Therefore, the newly built pig farm in the cooperative lacked feeders, and very few people were willing to go. The first female feeder to go to the pig farm, Lang Xinghua, was persuaded to go home by her mother in less than half a month because she was afraid of getting dirty, afraid of hardship, and afraid of being laughed at.

The young girl Wei Meizhen thought to herself: I am a member of the Communist Youth League, and I should go to the most needed and most difficult post in production. She told the Youth League organization about her willingness to become a feeder, and also made her request to the Party branch. Lang Dagui, a member of the Party branch committee, wanted to test whether she was truly determined, so he said to her: "Raising pigs is dirty and hard, you can't do it. I don't believe you know that until you go to the pig farm to see it." Wei Meizhen ran to the pig farm and watched for a long time. When she came back, she once again asked Lang Dagui, "The pig farm is not dirty or hard, it's about the same as being in the production team, let me go!" Finally, the cooperative management committee agreed to transfer her to be a feeder.

When Wei Meizhen started working at the pig farm, some older cooperative members said that she wouldn't be able to stay at the pig farm, that it was just "three days of novelty." Her mother also didn't approve of her raising pigs. But Wei Meizhen's determination was firm, and none of this could shake her in the slightest.

In the first few days of arriving at the pig farm, there were indeed many difficulties. If she fed the pigs too little, they wouldn't be full and would knock over the feeding basins; if she fed them too much, she would waste feed. Others could sweep the pigpens quickly, but she wasn't skilled, and she was slow, so she was anxious. One night, she secretly cried about it. Lang Dagui, a member of the Party branch committee, learned about this and went to ask her: "Are you frightened by the difficulties?" She replied, "I'm not afraid of difficulties, I'm just afraid of raising the pigs badly and not completing the task." Lang Dagui advised her not to be impatient and to slowly learn from the old feeders.

After a year of work, Wei Meizhen is already an excellent feeder. She knows what to feed the sow before it gives birth, what to feed it after it gives birth to piglets, and how to take care of the sow and piglets, etc. Now she can take care of six sows by herself. Whenever a sow gives birth to piglets, she is always happy to stay up day and night, unwilling to leave, sometimes adding grass to the pig and sometimes disinfecting the pig's teats. If the pigs have lice, she catches them or uses alcohol to kill the lice. Every day she carefully observes the eating habits of each pig she cares for, and if she finds anything abnormal, she immediately asks a veterinarian to treat it. Because of her careful feeding, the survival rate of piglets has also increased by 22%.

Wei Meizhen's success in raising pigs has changed the cooperative members' outdated views on raising sows, and now no one discriminates against young girls raising pigs. When Wei Meizhen is mentioned, everyone praises her as a good girl. As a result, many young men also want to go to the pig farm to become feeders. With the expansion of the pig farm, in October, two more girls the same age as Wei Meizhen came, one named Chen Baodi and one named Wei Meixian. They help each other, you let the pigs out, I sweep the pen, you watch the pigs, I collect manure, and they are all very happy. With the help of Wei Meizhen, Wei Meixian is now able to take care of ten sows, and Chen Baodi is also able to take care of five sows.

    三个养猪姑娘
    新华社记者　石正章
    在安徽省泾县太园农业社的养猪场里，有三个十七岁的女饲养员，她们都是青年团员。
    年青姑娘去养母猪，在当地还是一件新鲜事。按照当地农民的旧看法，养母猪是不光采的，只有年老无靠的人才养母猪。因此，社里新建的养猪场缺少饲养员，总是很少人愿意去。第一个到养猪场去的女饲养员郎杏花，因为怕脏，怕苦，又怕人笑话，没呆上半个月就被她妈妈劝回家了。
    年青的姑娘卫美珍心里想：我是个青年团员，应该到生产上最需要、最困难的岗位上去。她向团组织说出了自己去当饲养员的志愿，又向党支部提出自己的要求。党支部委员郎大桂想试试她是不是真正有决心，就对她说：“养猪又脏又苦，你干不来，不相信你先到养猪场去看看就知道了。”卫美珍跑到养猪场去看了半天，回来再一次向郎大桂要求说：“养猪场不脏不苦，和在生产队里差不多，让我去吧！”最后，社务管理委员会同意调她去当饲养员了。
    卫美珍进养猪场工作，有些年纪大的社员就说她在养猪场里蹲不下来，只不过是“三天新鲜”。她妈妈也不赞成她去养猪。但是卫美珍的决心已定，这一切都不能丝毫动摇她。
    初到养猪场的几天，实在也有不少困难。给猪喂料少了，猪吃不饱，把喂猪的盆都捣翻了；喂多了吧，又浪费了饲料。别人扫猪笼一下就扫好了，她不熟练，手脚慢，心里就着急，有一天晚上，她为此偷偷地哭了一顿。党支部委员郎大桂知道了这件事，便去问她：“给困难吓怕了吗？”她回答说：“不怕困难，只是怕把猪养坏了，完不成任务。”郎大桂就劝她不要性急，慢慢向老饲养员学习。
    经过一年来的工作，卫美珍已经是一个出色的饲养员了。她懂得在母猪分娩前应该给它吃什么，生过小猪以后给它吃什么，怎样看管母猪和小猪等等。现在她一个人能看管六只母猪了。每当母猪生小猪的时候，她总是高兴得日夜守候着，不肯离开一步，时而给猪添草，时而给猪的奶头消毒。猪生了虱子，她就给它捉，或者用酒精消灭虱子。她每天都细心地观察她看管的每一只猪的吃食情况，如果发现有不正常的，就立即请兽医来治疗。由于她细心饲养，小猪的成活率也提高了22％。
    卫美珍养猪获得了显著的成绩，改变了社员们对养母猪的陈旧看法，现在再没有人歧视年轻姑娘养猪了。一提起卫美珍，大家都称赞她是个好姑娘。这样一来，很多年轻小伙子也都想到养猪场去当饲养员了。随着养猪场的扩大，10月份又来了两个和卫美珍同年的姑娘，一个叫陈抱弟，一个叫卫梅仙。她们互相帮助，你放猪，我扫笼，你看猪，我拾粪，都忙得很高兴。在卫美珍的帮助下，现在卫梅仙已经能够看管十只母猪，陈抱弟也能够看管五只母猪了。
