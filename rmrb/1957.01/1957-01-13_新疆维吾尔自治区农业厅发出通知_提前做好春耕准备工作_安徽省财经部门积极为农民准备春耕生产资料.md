Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 12th. The Agricultural Department of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, in response to the neglect of preparations for spring plowing in agricultural areas, recently issued a notice requiring early preparation for spring plowing.

According to typical inspections by cadres of the Agricultural Department in some counties and districts in southern and northern Xinjiang, farmers started accumulating manure a month later than in previous years, and fertilizers needed for spring plowing are still generally lacking. Some areas in southern Xinjiang have mild climates and originally had the conditions to level land, dig springs, and repair canals, but no action has been taken. Some agricultural cooperatives have not yet carefully selected seeds to be used for spring sowing, and some have been poorly stored and have become moldy. In many areas, cotton seeds have not yet been ginned. The Agricultural Department believes that if these problems are not resolved in time, they will inevitably affect this year's agricultural production increase. The emergence of these phenomena is due, on the one hand, to the fact that rural cadres are busy with year-end distribution, rectification, merging, and conversion of cooperatives, and grain procurement; on the other hand, agricultural cooperative cadres and rural cadres have neglected the important task of preparing for spring plowing while carrying out the above-mentioned work.

Now that there are still more than two months before spring plowing in various parts of Xinjiang, the Agricultural Department requires all localities to first launch a mass manure accumulation campaign, and at the same time conduct an in-depth inspection of the preservation and storage of seeds, the repair of agricultural tools, the preparation of fodder and feed, and the feeding of draft animals, and solve the problems as soon as possible. All spring plowing preparation work that can be done, such as water conservancy construction and land leveling, should be seized upon in order to make preparations for this year's spring plowing in advance.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 12th. Financial and economic departments in Anhui Province are preparing production materials and funds needed for spring farming for farmers in advance.

A large number of new agricultural tools, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and sprayers purchased by the Anhui Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative in October and November of last year have been transported to supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the province. Among them, the pesticides and sprayers transported to various places have exceeded the planned supply volume for the first quarter of this year. The vast majority of the two thousand draft horses purchased by the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Inner Mongolia have also been transported to both sides of the Huai River. According to the needs of farmers, the total value of production materials supplied to farmers by the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the first quarter of this year will increase by more than 21% compared with the same period last year. Among them, the supply of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural machinery has increased the most.

The relevant departments have also made early preparations for the seeds needed by farmers. The Anhui Provincial Grain and Agricultural Products Purchasing Department has decided to transfer 9.05 million jin of cotton seeds from Anqing and Bengbu prefectures to supply areas lacking cotton seeds. The grain department decided to transfer a large number of rice seeds from Anqing Prefecture to support the conversion to rice cultivation in the Huaibei area.

The Anhui Provincial Branch of the Agricultural Bank of China has initially formulated agricultural loan targets. In the first half of this year, the bank will lend more than 14.8 million yuan to farmers to purchase chemical fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, and sprayers.

    新疆维吾尔自治区农业厅发出通知
    提前做好春耕准备工作
    安徽省财经部门积极为农民准备春耕生产资料
    新华社乌鲁木齐12日电　新疆维吾尔自治区农业厅针对农业地区忽视备耕工作的情况，最近发出通知，要求提前做好备耕工作。
    根据农业厅干部在南疆和北疆的一些县、区典型检查，农民群众动手积肥比往年迟了一个月，春耕所需要的肥料目前还普遍缺乏。南疆有些地区气候温和，本来有条件平整土地、掏泉修渠，但是也未动手。留作春播的种籽，有的农业社还没有精选，有的保管不良发生潮霉，棉花籽种很多地区还未轧出来。农业厅认为，这些问题如果不及时解决，必将影响今年农业增产。这些现象的产生，一方面是由于农村干部忙于年终分配、整社、并社、转社和征购粮食等工作；另一方面是农业社干部和农村干部进行上述工作时，对备耕这一重要工作有所忽视。
    现在新疆各地离春耕还有两个多月，农业厅要求各地首先展开一个群众性的积肥运动，同时对于种籽的保存和储备，农具的检修，饲草饲料的准备和耕畜的饲养情况，进行一次深入检查，及早地解决问题。凡能够做到的备耕工作，例如兴修水利，平整土地，都应该抓紧时机进行，以便提前做好今年的春耕准备工作。
    新华社合肥12日电　安徽省财经部门提早为农民准备春耕生产所需的生产资料和资金。
    安徽省供销合作社在去年10月和11月采购的新式农具、化学肥料和农药、药械，已经有大批运到省内各地供销合作社。其中运到各地的农药和药械，超过了今年第一季度的计划供应量。省供销合作社在内蒙古采购的两千匹耕马，绝大多数也运到了淮河两岸。省供销合作社根据农民的需要，今年第一季度供应农民的生产资料总值将比去年同期增加21％以上。其中化学肥料、农药和农械的供应量增加得最多。
    农民需要的种子，有关部门也及早作了准备。安徽省粮食和农产品采购部门已经确定从安庆、蚌埠两个专区调出九百零五万斤棉籽，供应缺少棉籽的地区。粮食部门决定从安庆专区调出大批水稻种子，支援淮北地区改种水稻。
    中国农业银行安徽省分行已经初步拟订了农业贷款的指标。
    今年上半年，银行贷给农民购买化学肥料、种子、农药和药械的款项将达一千四百八十多万元。
