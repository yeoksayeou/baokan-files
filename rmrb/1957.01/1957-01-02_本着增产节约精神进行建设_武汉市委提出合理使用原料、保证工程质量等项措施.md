Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 31st. 1957 will be a year of unprecedentedly intense, arduous, and complex production and construction tasks for Wuhan. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, at its plenary session held on the 29th and 30th, proposed to promote the spirit of hard work and plain living to meet the heavy tasks of 1957.

According to the plan, the total investment in key national construction projects in Wuhan in 1957 will be more than double that of 1956. However, investment in urban construction will be reduced in 1957, and the development of other undertakings will be difficult to fully adapt to the requirements of production and construction. This is a contradiction that, if not resolved well, will have an adverse impact on production and construction and people's lives. In addition, there are many difficulties in the supply of raw materials for production and construction, which require effective measures to overcome.

The Municipal Party Committee meeting believes that these difficulties are difficulties on the road of progress and can be overcome. The most effective way to overcome these difficulties is to continue to promote the tradition of hard work and plain living, resolutely implement the spirit of diligence and economy in construction, and extensively and deeply carry out mass movements for increasing production and practicing economy. Therefore, the meeting decided to make the development of the movement to increase production and practice economy the central task for the whole year of 1957, and all other work should be carried out in the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy.

The meeting, in response to the phenomena of extravagance and waste that are growing in various aspects, believes that to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, it is first necessary to carry out arduous ideological education work, that is, education on labor creating happiness and labor being glorious; at the same time, cadres and the people should be made aware that increasing production and practicing economy not only has economic significance, but more importantly, it will bring about a new social atmosphere of diligence and thrift. Various ideas that hinder the development of the movement to increase production and practice economy, such as thinking that "increasing production and practicing economy happens every year, and it's just a passing fad anyway"; only seeing the difficult side and not seeing the potential power of increasing production and practicing economy, and therefore lacking confidence, must also be criticized.

The meeting pointed out that the movement to increase production and practice economy in 1957 should pay attention to solving the following four problems: 1. Vigorously find and rationally use raw materials. 2. Increasing production and practicing economy must be carried out under the principle of ensuring quality and safety, and blind and reckless work should be opposed. 3. All departments must support rationalization proposals from improving management and strengthening technical organizational measures; from reforming existing working methods, systems, and institutions, increase production capacity, and improve work efficiency and quality. 4. Party organizations at all levels must actively and patiently lead the resolution of new problems that arise in the three links of production, supply, and sales.

    本着增产节约精神进行建设
    武汉市委提出合理使用原料、保证工程质量等项措施
    新华社武汉31日电　1957年将是武汉市的生产、建设任务空前紧张、艰巨和复杂的一年。中共武汉市委员会在29日和30日举行的全体会议，提出要发扬艰苦朴素的精神，迎接1957年的繁重任务。
    根据计划，1957年国家在武汉市的重点建设工程，投资总额将比1956年增加一倍以上。但是，城市建设的投资在1957年却有所削减，其他各项事业的发展也很难和生产建设的要求完全适应。这是一个矛盾，如果不能很好地解决，对生产建设事业和人民生活都将造成不利的影响。除此以外，生产建设事业在原材料的供应上也有不少困难，需要采取有效措施加以克服。
    市委会议认为，这些困难是前进道路上的困难，它们是可能克服的。而克服这些困难的最有效方法就是继续发扬艰苦朴素的传统，坚决贯彻勤俭建设的精神，广泛而深入地开展群众性的增产节约运动。因此，会议决定把开展增产节约运动作为1957年全年的中心工作，一切其他工作都要本着增产节约的精神来办理。
    会议针对当前各方面滋长着的铺张浪费、奢侈浮华的现象，认为开展增产节约运动首先必须进行艰苦的思想教育工作，即劳动创造幸福和劳动光荣的教育；同时使干部和人民认识增产节约不仅具有经济意义，更重要的是它将带来一种新的勤俭朴素的社会风气。对于各种各样的障碍增产节约运动开展的思想，如认为“增产节约，年年有之，反正是一阵风”；只看到困难一面，看不到增产节约的潜在力量，因而信心不足的思想等等，也必须予以批判。
    会议指出1957年的增产节约运动应当注意解决如下四个问题：一、大力寻找和合理使用原材料。二、增产节约必须在保证质量和安全的原则下进行，反对盲目乱干。三、各部门都要从改善管理、加强技术组织措施上支持合理化建议；从改革现有工作方法、制度、机构上，增加生产力量，提高工作效率和质量。四、党的各级组织必须积极地、不厌其烦地领导解决产、供、销三个环节间出现的新问题。
