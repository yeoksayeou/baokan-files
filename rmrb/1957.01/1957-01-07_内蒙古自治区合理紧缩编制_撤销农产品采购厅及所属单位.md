    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Rationally Reduces Staffing
    Abolishes the Agricultural Product Procurement Bureau and Subordinate Units
    (This newspaper dispatch) According to the Inner Mongolia Daily, in the spirit of increasing production, practicing economy, and streamlining organizations, the Agricultural Product Procurement Bureau of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and its subordinate procurement units in various leagues, banners, and counties were officially abolished on January 1st. Currently, all administrative and business work has been transferred to the supply and marketing cooperatives. This measure will save the expenses of more than 2,500 staff members and allow these personnel to be transferred to places where they are needed.
    Since its establishment in March 1956, the business activities of the Agricultural Product Procurement Bureau of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and its subordinate units have overlapped significantly with the business of the supply and marketing cooperatives. Originally, the procurement of agricultural and pastoral products could have been entirely completed by the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives. However, due to the emphasis on "aligning" with the Central Agricultural Product Procurement Department, a series of procurement departments were also established. As a result, procurement departments once competed with grassroots cooperatives to purchase agricultural and pastoral products. After the adjustment, the procurement departments were still unable to fully undertake the procurement work, and many agricultural and pastoral products still needed to rely on grassroots cooperatives for proxy purchases. In this way, an unnecessary procedure was added to the procurement process, and the turnover cost increased accordingly. In order to make up for the huge business administrative expenses, procurement departments in many areas adopted methods of downgrading and price suppression in the procurement process, causing economic losses to farmers.
    After the abolition of the Agricultural Product Procurement Bureau and its subordinate units, the procurement of agricultural and pastoral products is entirely undertaken by the supply and marketing cooperatives, eliminating unnecessary intermediate levels, reducing the phenomenon of downgrading and price suppression, and ensuring reasonable prices for farmers and herdsmen to sell their agricultural and pastoral products.

    内蒙古自治区合理紧缩编制
    撤销农产品采购厅及所属单位
    本报讯　据内蒙古日报消息：根据增产节约精简机构的精神，内蒙古自治区农产品采购厅及其所属各盟旗县的采购单位，已在1月1日正式撤销。目前，其行政及业务工作已全部划归供销社办理。这一措施将节约两千五百多名工作人员的开支，并能将这些人力调配到需要的地方去。
    内蒙古自治区农产品采购厅及其所属单位自1956年3月成立以来，其业务活动范围和供销社业务有很多重复。本来农牧产品采购工作完全可以由基层供销社完成的，但由于强调和中央农产品采购部“对口”，便也增设了一系列的采购部门。结果就一度出现了采购部门同基层社争购农牧产品的情况。经调整后，采购部门又不能全部担负起采购工作，许多农牧产品仍需依靠基层社代购。这样，在采购上就比过去多添了一道手续，随着周转费用也就增加了，许多地区的采购部门为了弥补庞大的业务行政开支，就在采购中采取压等压价的手段，致使农民在经济上受到损失。
    农产品采购厅及所属单位撤销后，农牧产品采购工作全部由供销社担当起来，取消了不必要的中间层次，而且也减少了压等压价现象，保证了农牧民出售农牧产品的合理价格。
