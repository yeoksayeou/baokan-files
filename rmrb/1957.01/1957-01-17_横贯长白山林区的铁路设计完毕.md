Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, January 15th. The survey and design of a forest railway, more than 200 kilometers long, in the Changbai Mountain forest area has now been completed.

	This railway, abbreviated as the Changlin Line, runs from Songshu Town in Linjiang County, Jilin Province, to Antu County. The Changlin Line traverses the Changbai Mountain forest area, passing through Daying District, Wanliang District, Beigang District, Xiaoyingzitun in Fusong County, and Antu District and Yanbian Sanatorium in Antu County. In addition to the dense forests, the area is also rich in products such as ginseng, matsutake mushrooms, medicinal materials, and various animal furs. Some areas also contain mineral deposits. After the completion of this railway, it will be more convenient to transport the mountain area's by-products to other places.

    横贯长白山林区的铁路设计完毕
    新华社长春15日电　长白山林区一条两百多公里长的林区铁路，现在已经勘测设计好了。
    这条铁路简称长林线，是从吉林省临江县的松树镇起到安图县止。长林线横贯长白山林区，沿途经过抚松县的大营区、万良区、北岗区、小营子屯、安图县的安图区及延边休养所等处。沿线各地除了一片茂密的森林以外，还盛产人参、元蘑、药材和各种兽皮等物产，有些地方还蕴藏着矿产。这条铁路修成以后，山区的副产品外运就更为便利。
