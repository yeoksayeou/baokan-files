    Impressions of China
    Yin Douxian, Head of the National Folk Art Troupe of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Director of the Art Bureau of the Ministry of Culture and Propaganda
    On October 21st, we crossed the Yalu River and set foot on Chinese soil. The sky was as clear as glass, and the water was crystal blue. This is characteristic of late autumn in Korea. The Yalu River, which flows through the border between Korea and China, reflected the bright Korean sky.
      The name "Yalu River" is as dear to us Korean people as a mother. Half of it belongs to China, and the other half to Korea. Just like the people of our two countries, Korea and China, it is forever inseparable. Just like the close friendship between Korea and China, it flows forever, eternally and inexhaustibly.
    Arriving in Andong, we changed trains and sped towards Shenyang. The smoke from the towering factory chimneys in the many cities the train passed caught our eye.
    At 3:00 PM on the 22nd, we arrived at Beijing Railway Station. As soon as we got off the train, we were surrounded by the welcoming crowd. Many of our comrades had been to China in 1954, and they were overjoyed to see their friends again, shouting loudly and embracing each other.
    Coming here, we didn't feel like we had arrived in a strange foreign country. We felt as warm and familiar as if we were in our own hometown.
    The first performance in Beijing was the opera "Chun Xiang Zhuan."
    On this day, Marshal Peng Dehuai, the Chinese people's dearest and closest friend, who had personally commanded the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield, also appeared in the audience.
      "Will this opera, with its language barrier, be a success or a failure?" As I sat in the audience and watched the stage, this thought never left my mind. During the intermission, I heard that many audience members had shed tears. Only then did I breathe a sigh of relief, because they not only understood it, but were also moved to tears.
    After the first performance, Chinese artists presented our comrades with beautiful flowers. Marshal Peng Dehuai personally went on stage, shook hands with each of our actors, and encouraged us with warm words.
    During the performances, I had the opportunity to visit the streets of Beijing and famous historical sites such as the Forbidden City, Jingshan Park, Beihai Park, the Temple of Heaven, Longevity Hill, and Zhongshan Park. During the visits, I learned about the ancient and beautiful Chinese culture. When visiting the Forbidden City, my first impression was that its structure was similar to that of Korea; however, its sheer scale could not help but amaze me, and the richness of the many precious objects displayed inside was truly astonishing.
    In the past, there were more than 40,000 servants in this palace, all for the sake of the emperor alone. The money the emperor spent on a single meal was enough for a peasant to eat for a year. The cost of Empress Dowager Cixi's birthday banquet was equivalent to the annual living expenses of 70,000 peasants, and there were more than 400 workers who specialized in making shoes for Empress Dowager Cixi alone. From this, it is not difficult to imagine the evils of the feudal system.
    But today, when the people are the masters of the country, this palace belongs to the people. It has become a museum marking the culture they have created, and a valuable relic marking the tradition of Asian culture.
    Our performances were also warmly welcomed in Nanjing and Shanghai. The ticket offices sold out several days' worth of tickets within two hours. Enthusiastic audiences often lined up in long queues in front of the theater before dawn in order to buy a ticket, waiting patiently. This enthusiastic welcome from the Chinese people moved our comrades, making us forget our fatigue, so much so that the performance dates in Nanjing and Hangzhou had to be extended by one day.
    Hangzhou is a beautiful place. Mentioning Hangzhou immediately brings to mind West Lake. West Lake is the scenic highlight of Hangzhou. Whether you are in the heart of the lake or on its shores, you will feel its enchanting beauty. The lake water changes with the seasons, and it is different in the morning, noon, and evening, as well as on cloudy and sunny days. Sometimes we sailed on the碧波 waves, singing boat songs, and sometimes we strolled under the weeping willows on the lake shore.
    Beijing was already experiencing early winter weather, and Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou were already in autumn, but in Guangzhou, it felt like summer.
    China is a country with a long history and a vast territory. In this country, there is so much fertile land, and at the same time, there are four different climates: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. And there is a population of 600 million!
    Before the public performance in Guangzhou, the Mayor of Guangzhou held a grand celebratory banquet to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the establishment of our troupe.
    According to Korean customs, people who go to a foreign land as guests must return to their own home to celebrate their birthday. This time, we let the troupe's significant birthday pass in Guangzhou, thousands of miles away.
    We didn't feel like we were guests in a foreign land at all. Instead, it was like celebrating our birthday in our own home.
    On the morning of December 4th, we arrived in Wuhan, where it was already winter. We drove to the Yangtze River wharf, where a speedboat was already waiting for us.
    Rowboats, sailboats, small steamers, and large steamers, one after another, were connected end to end, shuttling back and forth. From this, we can see the role of the Yangtze River in China's transportation. To the left of the direction of our steamer was the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge under construction. The Chinese people's desire of more than 50 years is about to be realized. After the completion of this bridge, it will open up roads to nine provinces. The scale of the Yangtze River Bridge is magnificent, and the scale of the project is known to the world.
    In Wuhan, I visited the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise, a factory with an annual output of 3.6 million tons of steel, the most modern mechanized equipment, and nearly 300,000 square meters, which is expected to be completed in 1957. After this factory is completed, more than 100,000 workers will work here. Various construction projects are currently underway in every city and village in China. After the completion of the second Five-Year Plan, it is not difficult to imagine how much the face of China will change.
    On December 12th, we left Wuhan and returned to Beijing. In these days, we did a lot of things and learned a lot of things. Among them, the most profound and unforgettable thing in our memory is the kindness and affection of the Chinese people. Everywhere we went, the people we met seemed like old friends we had not seen for many years, and we felt an indescribable joy. We talked freely together, and it was so hard to part when we said goodbye. Everywhere we went, we met Chun Xiang, Li Menglong, and Yue Mei. The tear-streaked face of Comrade Wei Zhuxia of the Shanghai Experimental Opera House who saw us off at the Shanghai Railway Station is something I will never forget. The people of our two countries have always had an inseparable blood relationship in the past. I deeply believe that there is no force that can interrupt this relationship. In the Chinese revolution, there was the blood of the Korean people; in our war against the American imperialist aggression, the Chinese people sent their dearest sons and daughters to help us with their blood; after the armistice, the Chinese people supported our economic recovery and construction work with spiritual and material resources. Today, the chimneys of Korean factories are emitting thick smoke, rusty machines are turning, museums are opening, cities are being built from the rubble, and the countryside is awakening from the ruins. To thank the Chinese people, the Korean people sent their art troupe to China.
    China, you will be even greater! Our motherland, you will be even more prosperous! The friendship between the people of Korea and China will flow forever like the waters of the Yalu River.

    中国印象
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国立民族艺术剧团团长  文化宣传省艺术局局长  尹斗宪
    10月21日，我们跨过了鸭绿江，踏上了中国的国土。天色像玻璃那样透明，水色碧清，这是朝鲜晚秋的特征，流经朝中两国国境的鸭绿江水，倒映出朝鲜明朗的天空。
      “鸭绿江”这名字，对我们朝鲜人民来说像母亲一样的亲切。她一半是中国的，另一半是朝鲜的，她正如我们朝、中两国人民一样，永远不可分离，它正如朝、中两国的亲密友谊一样，永远长春，永远源源不绝地流着。
    到安东，我们换了火车向沈阳奔驰。火车经过的许多城市，高耸着的工厂烟囱的炊烟，浮上我们的眼帘。
    22日下午三时，我们到达了北京车站。我们一下车就被欢迎我们的人群包围起来。我们中间，有许多同志曾在1954年来过中国，他们又见到了自己的朋友，高兴得大声嚷着，互相拥抱着。
    我们来到这里，不像是来到了生疏的异国，我们感觉好似是在自己家乡一样的温暖和亲切。
    在北京第一场演出的是唱剧“春香传”。
    这一天，我们朝鲜人民最熟悉和最亲近的朋友，亲自在朝鲜战场上指挥过中国人民志愿军的彭德怀元帅也出现在观众席里。
      “像这样语言隔阂的歌剧，到底是成功呢，还是失败？”当我坐在观众席上望着舞台的时候，这个念头一直没有离开我的脑子。在幕间休息的时候，听说有许多观众流泪了，那时，我才安心地叹了一口长气，因为，那不仅是看懂了，而且，还感动得掉下了眼泪。
    第一次演出结束后，中国的艺术家们把美丽的鲜花献给我们的同志，彭德怀元帅还亲自走上舞台，和我们的演员们一一握手，并且用温暖的话语鼓舞了我们。
    在演出期间，我有机会参观了北京的街道和故宫、景山公园、北海公园、天坛、万寿山、中山公园等名胜古迹。在参观中，我知道了古老而优美的中国文化。在参观故宫时，第一个印象是感到它的构造和朝鲜相仿；但是规模之庞大，不得不使我惊讶，里面所陈列的许多贵重物品，其内容的丰富又使我十分惊奇。
    过去，在这宫庭里有四万多个侍从，都是为了皇帝一人。皇帝一个人一餐所花的钱可以够一个农民吃一年。慈禧太后过生日时的一席饭相当于七万农民一年的生活费用，为慈禧太后一个人专门制鞋的工人就有四百多个。从这里不难想像出封建制度的罪恶。
    可是人民当了国家主人的今天，这宫庭已经属于人民了，它成了标志着他们所创造的文化的博物馆，成为标志着亚洲文化传统的宝贵遗物。
    我们的演出在南京、上海两地也同样受到了热烈的欢迎。售票处在两小时之内卖完了几天的票。热情的观众们为了要买到一张票常常在天亮以前就排成一条很长的行列站在剧场的前面耐心地等待着。中国人民的这种热情的欢迎感动了我们的同志们，使我们忘却了疲劳，以至在南京和杭州的演出日期不得不延长了一天。
    杭州是一个美丽的地方。提起杭州立刻使人联想到西湖。西湖是杭州的胜景，无论是在湖心还是在湖边，你都会感到它那迷人的景色。湖水的变幻四季不同，一天之中，早上、中午和晚上不同，阴天和晴天也有所不同。我们有时乘船荡漾在碧波之中，唱着船歌，有时在湖畔的垂柳下面散步。
    北京已经是初冬的天气，南京、上海和杭州也已经是秋天了，可是在广州却好像是夏天。
    中国是一个历史悠久幅员广阔的国家。在这个国度里有着这样多的良田沃土，在同一个时候又有着春、夏、秋、冬四种不同的气候，有着六亿之众的人口！
    在广州公演之前，广州市市长举行了盛大的庆祝宴会来庆祝我们剧团建立四周年的纪念日。
    按照朝鲜的风俗，去到外地作客的人们是一定要回到自己的家里过生日的。这次，我们让剧团的这个有意义的生日在万里以外的广州度过了。
    我们一点都不觉得是在异乡作客，反而像是在自己的家里过生日似的。
    12月4日晨我们到了武汉，那里已经是冬天了。我们乘汽车驶向长江码头，这时准备好了的汽艇早已在等候我们了。
    摇橹的小船、帆船、小汽船、大汽船一条条地首尾相连穿梭般的往来着。从这里可以看出长江在中国交通运输上所起的作用。在我们乘坐的汽船行驶方向的左面是正在兴建中的武汉长江大桥。中国人民五十多年的宿望快实现了，这座大桥建成之后将要打开通向九个省的道路，长江大桥规模之雄伟，工程之浩大是举世皆知的。
    在武汉，我参观了武汉钢铁联合企业，这个有着年产钢铁三百六十万吨、最新式机械化设备的将近三十万平方公尺的工厂，预计在1957年可以建成。在这个厂竣工之后将会有十万以上的工人在这里工作。各种建设事业，今天正在中国的每个城市和乡村里进行着。在第二个五年计划完成之后，中国的面貌将有多大的变化，现在是不难想像的。
    12月12日，我们离开武汉又回到了北京。在这些日子里，我们作了很多的事，学习到很多的东西。其中，在我们记忆里最深刻、最令人难忘的是中国人民的亲切多情。到每个地方我们所遇到的人都好像是久别多年的老友一样，感到一种说不出的喜悦。我们在一起尽情的畅谈，分别的时候又是那样的难舍。我们每到一处都遇到了春香、李梦龙和月梅。在上海车站上为我们送行的上海实验歌剧院的尉珠侠同志那副满是泪痕的脸是我永远不能忘记的。我们两国人民在过去的历史中一直有着不可分的血肉关系。我深深地相信，这种关系是没有任何力量可以使它中断的。在中国的革命中曾有过朝鲜人民的鲜血；在我们反对美帝国主义侵略的战争中，中国人民派遣了自己最心爱的儿女用鲜血来援助了我们；停战后，中国人民又在精神上物质上来支援我们的经济恢复和建设工作。今天，朝鲜工厂的烟囱里正在冒出浓烟，生了锈的机器正在转动，博物馆正在开放，城市正在瓦砾中兴建起来，农村正在废墟中苏醒过来。为了感谢中国人民，朝鲜人民派遣了自己的艺术团来到了中国。
    中国啊，你将会更加伟大！我们的祖国啊，你将会更加繁荣！朝中两国人民之间的友谊像鸭绿江的江水一样永远长流。
