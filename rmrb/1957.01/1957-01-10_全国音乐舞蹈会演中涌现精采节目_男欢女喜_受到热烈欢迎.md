Xinhua News Agency, January 8th: (By Xinhua News Agency reporter Shen Ding) The ancient folk dance "Male Joy, Female Delight," performed by the Shanghai delegation from January 4th to 7th at the National Professional Music and Dance Festival in Beijing, was requested to be repeated by the audience almost every time.

	Amidst the refreshing Jiangnan folk music, five couples, their faces half-covered by folding fans, came to the front of the stage. They danced in pairs.

	"Male Joy, Female Delight" is popular in the rural areas of Yixing, famous for its pottery production. Legend has it that long, long ago, there was a pair of lovers who could not freely love each other in life, and only had the chance to reunite after death. Therefore, their ghosts always danced together happily. To praise this steadfast love, people began to wear masks and dance to commemorate the couple, and called this dance "Male Joy, Female Delight."

	It is said that "Male Joy, Female Delight" has been popular for over a thousand years. Many local pottery workers and farmers are skilled performers of this dance.

    全国音乐舞蹈会演中涌现精采节目
    “男欢女喜”受到热烈欢迎
    据新华社8日讯　新华社记者沈鼎报道，古老的民间舞蹈“男欢女喜”，由上海市代表团从4日起到7日在北京参加全国专业团体音乐舞蹈会演演出，几乎每次都被观众要求重演。
    在清新的江南民间乐曲声中，五对男女用折扇半遮着脸来到台前。他们双双起舞。
    “男欢女喜”盛行在以出产陶器著名的宜兴农村里。相传在很久很久以前，有一对生前不能自由相爱的情人，死后才得相聚的机会，因此，他们的鬼魂总是在一起欢乐地舞蹈。为了歌颂这种坚贞的爱情，人们开始戴了假面跳着舞来纪念这对情人，并且把这个舞蹈称为“男欢女喜”。
    据说，“男欢女喜”已经流行上千年。当地许多陶器工人和农民都是表演这个舞蹈的好手。
