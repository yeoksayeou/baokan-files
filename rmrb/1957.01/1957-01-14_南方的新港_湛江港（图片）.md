The great Song Dynasty poet Su Dongpo inscribed the words "Tian Ya Hai Jiao" (Edge of the World) on a rock on the Leizhou Peninsula. At that time, this place was a remote and sparsely populated area. But now, there is a giant port that plays an increasingly significant role in developing foreign trade and supporting national construction—Zhanjiang Port—connecting China's southern gateway with overseas countries. Since May of last year, ten-thousand-ton ships from Czechoslovakia, Poland, Vietnam, and Sweden have entered the port, importing large quantities of materials, including oil pipelines, machine tools, steel rails, and auto parts.

Now, the first phase of the port's basic construction has been completed. The deep-water wharf, which can simultaneously berth two ten-thousand-ton ships, has already begun to handle goods, serving China's economic construction. The intermediate wharf and oil wharf, which can simultaneously berth three five-thousand-ton ships, are under active construction and will be fully completed this year. After the first phase of the project is completed, the second and third phases will continue. In the future, the port wharves can simultaneously berth fifteen ten-thousand-ton ships.

	On December 27th last year, more than 3,000 citizens of Zhanjiang warmly celebrated the official early use of Zhanjiang Port and welcomed the Polish ten-thousand-ton ship "Dombrowski" into the port.

	There is no crowding and noise on the wharf, no dust, and no people running and sweating with heavy loads. Instead, there are various electric trucks, electric shovels, and four-wheeled flatcars coming and going.

	Two railway lines run parallel through the legs of the gantry crane on the wharf. With a stretch of its long arm, the crane can grab things 25 meters away and accurately place them into the train.

	This year's Zhanjiang will be even more magnificent and beautiful. This is the new residential area of Zhanjiang. Schools, kindergartens, shops, post offices, and gardens for people to rest in will also be built here.

	Xiying, Zhanjiang City, which faces the sea, will become even more beautiful. A seaside park including a swimming pool, boating lake, viewing platform, children's playground, and coconut grove is about to be built. This is a corner of the future seaside park.

    南方的新港——湛江港
    宋朝的大诗人苏东坡，曾在雷州半岛的一块岩石上题了“天涯海角”四个字。那时，这个地方是人迹罕到的偏僻之区。可是现在，这里出现了在发展对外贸易和支援全国建设中起着日益显著作用的一个巨港——湛江港，使我国南方的大门和海外各国连结起来了。从去年5月以来，有捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、越南和瑞典等国的万吨轮船进港，进口了大批的物资，其中有输油管、机床、钢轨和汽车零件等。
    现在，建港的第一期基本工程已经完毕，可同时停泊两艘万吨轮船的深水码头，已经开始吞吐物资，为我国经济建设服务了。可同时停泊三艘五千吨轮船的中级码头和油码头正在积极施工，今年内可全部完成。第一期工程完成后，将继续进行第二、第三期工程。将来的港口码头可以同时靠泊万吨级的轮船十五艘。	    除署名者外均为陈福北摄影　（南方日报社稿）

    过去被人称为“苦力”的码头工人陈亚来，现在已经成为驾驶搬运机车的熟练司机了。
    去年12月27日，湛江市三千多市民在码头上热烈庆祝湛江港的正式提前使用，并欢迎波兰邓博夫斯基号万吨轮船驶入港口。
    在码头上没有拥挤和嘈杂，没有尘土弥漫，也看不到背负重载奔跑淌汗的人，这里穿梭往来的尽是各式各样的电搬车、电铲车和四轮平车。
    码头上有两条铁路从龙门式起重机的胯下并行通过。起重机的长臂一伸，可以把二十五公尺以外的东西抓起，准确地放进火车里。
    今年的湛江市将更加雄伟壮丽了。这是湛江市的新住宅区。在这里，还要建立学校、幼儿园、商店、邮局和供人们休憩的花园。
    湛江市临海的西营将变得更美丽。一个包括有游泳池、划船湖、观海台、儿童游乐场和椰树林的海滨公园即将兴建起来。这是未来的海滨公园的一角。
