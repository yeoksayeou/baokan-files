Introducing Our Country's Rich Medical Heritage
Kunming Holds Exhibition of Traditional Chinese Medicine

(Our Newspaper) The Kunming Traditional Chinese Medicine Exhibition has been well-received by the general public. Since its opening on October 7th last year, it has attracted over 90,000 visitors to date.

The exhibition is divided into three parts. The first hall comprehensively introduces the development and great achievements of traditional Chinese medicine, with a focus on the deeds of famous Yunnan doctors throughout history. These include Chen Fengdian, a chief doctor in the peasant uprising army at the end of the Ming Dynasty; Zhao Yun, who was taught herbal medicine by his Dai ethnic group mother-in-law; and Qu Huanzhang, the creator of Yunnan Baiyao (White Medicine). In addition, it introduces the use of torch lighting for epidemic prevention and pest control by ethnic minorities, and the “picking grass seeds” gold needle therapy. The second hall displays over a thousand types of Chinese medicinal herbs. The exhibition demonstrates that Yunnan has an extremely rich supply of medicinal materials. Yunnan produces over 80% of the various medicinal materials found in the country, with its output accounting for about one-third of the national total. Almost every region in the province produces medicinal materials. Previously, sand ginger was entirely imported, but now Yunnan-produced sand ginger can be seen at the exhibition. Guangmuxiang (Radix Aucklandiae), previously imported from India and Burma, has now been successfully introduced and cultivated in Lijiang, becoming "Yunnan Muxiang." The exhibited Poria cocos weighs 38 jin (approximately 19 kg), and it is not even the largest; a 50-plus jin one appeared at the Dali March Street Fair last year. In addition, there are special local medicinal materials such as Sanqi (Panax notoginseng), Cordyceps sinensis, betel nut, Danggui (Angelica sinensis), musk, bear bile, and rhinoceros horn, as well as "Green Leaf Indestructible" for bone setting and "Selaginella involvens" for hemostasis, which are highly effective medicinal herbs. The third hall introduces the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine through some typical cases, many of which are also from Yunnan. The exhibition also has an affiliated clinic, which has treated over 4,000 people to date.

This rich, vivid, and locally characteristic exhibition is very popular among the masses. The exhibition has accepted public feedback and decided to hold a touring exhibition in some special districts after its conclusion in Kunming. (Zhang Jiechun)

    介绍我国丰富的医学遗产
    昆明举行中医中药展览会
    本报讯　昆明市中医中药展览会受到广大群众的欢迎，自去年10月7日展出以来，到目前止观众已达九万多人。
    展览会共分三个部分。在第一馆中，除全面地介绍了祖国医学的发展情况和伟大成就外，并着重介绍了云南历代名医的事迹。其中有明末农民起义军中的正首医生陈凤典、受傣族丈母传授的草药医赵运和云南白药的创制者曲焕章等。此外，还介绍了少数民族燃点火把防疫灭虫和“挑草子”的金针疗法等。第二馆展出了一千来种中药和草药。从展览会上可以看出，云南药材是极其丰富的。全国各种药材，有80％以上云南都出产，产量约占全国的三分之一，全省几乎没有一个地区不产药材。砂仁以前是全靠进口的，现在在展览会上可以看到云南产的砂仁；广木香以前是从印度和缅甸进口的，现在已在丽江引种成功而成为“云木香”；展出的茯苓重达三十八斤，而这还不是最大的，去年大理三月街出现过五十多斤重的。此外，还有三七、冬虫夏草、槟榔、当归、麝香、熊胆和犀角等特产药材，以及接骨用的“绿叶打不死”、止血用的“卷柏”等疗效卓著的药草。第三馆以一些典型的病例介绍了中医中药的疗效，其中有许多例子也都是云南的。展览会还附设了一个门诊部，到目前止看病的人已有四千多。
    这个内容丰富生动而又具有地方特色的展览会，深受群众欢迎。展览会接受群众意见，已决定在昆明结束后，将到部分专区作巡回展出。　（章皆淳）
