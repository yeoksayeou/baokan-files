Xinhua News Agency, Krakow, January 13th: Premier Zhou Enlai visited Wawel, Poland's largest ancient palace, in Krakow, the ancient cultural city of Poland, this morning.

The ancient walls and roofs of Wawel were covered with皑皑 white snow, and the Five-Star Red Flag fluttered in the high sky. Premier Zhou Enlai expressed great interest in this ancient palace, which began to be built as early as the fourteenth century, and the ancient cultural relics displayed in it. He paid special attention to the atmosphere of real life revealed in those paintings and sculptures of religious stories. Here are wood carvings of religious stories such as the birth and ascension of Jesus carved by the Polish 18th-century sculptor Stwohao using linden wood. The images of the wood carvings are very realistic and very consistent with the principles of anatomy. Premier Zhou Enlai also carefully appreciated the architectural style of Wawel Palace. This is a very representative ancient building in Poland. The introducer told the guests that the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw adopted the architectural style of Wawel Palace in many places. Premier Zhou also visited in detail the coffins of ancient Polish heroes and cultural celebrities hidden in the basement of the Wawel Palace Cathedral.

After visiting Wawel Palace, Premier Zhou and Cyrankiewicz rode in the same car and toured the city with other members of the delegation. Along the streets through which the delegation's vehicles passed, there were dense crowds of people stretching as far as the eye could see. At this time, the whole city of Krakow turned out, men, women, old and young were on the streets where snowflakes were flying, warmly welcoming the Chinese guests. People waved to the delegation, and the cheers echoed everywhere with the delegation's vehicles. Large banners with "Long Live Sino-Polish Friendship!" and "Warmly Welcome Premier Zhou Enlai!" were hung everywhere on the streets. Many fathers held their children high, and the children waved their small hands happily to greet the Chinese guests. An old worker warmly shook the hands of the Chinese comrades and said to his young son: "Look! Our friends who live on the other side of the earth have come to visit us. Salute! Dear Chinese comrades." After touring Krakow, the delegation went to Nowa Huta and the Lenin Metallurgical Combine, more than ten kilometers away from Krakow, to visit.

    周总理参观波兰最大的古宫
    新华社克拉科夫13日电　周恩来总理今天上午在波兰文化古城克拉科夫参观了波兰最大的古宫瓦维尔。
    古老的瓦维尔的宫墙和屋顶上，复盖着皑皑的白雪，五星红旗在高空随风飘扬。周恩来总理对这座早在十四世纪就开始建立的古宫和其中陈列的古代文物表示了很大兴趣，他特别注意到在那些宗教故事的绘画和雕刻中，流露出来的现实生活的气息。这里有波兰十八世纪雕刻家斯特沃郝用菩提木雕刻的耶苏诞生、升天等宗教故事体裁的木雕。木雕的形象都非常逼真，十分合于解剖学的原理。周恩来总理还很细心地欣赏了瓦维尔宫的建筑风格。这是波古代很有代表性的建筑。介绍的人对客人说，华沙文化科学宫在许多地方都采用瓦维尔宫的建筑式样。周总理还详细地参观了在瓦维尔宫教堂地下室藏着的古代波兰英雄和文化名人的棺木。
    参观瓦维尔宫以后，周总理和西伦凯维兹同乘一辆汽车和代表团其他人员游览了市区。在代表团车辆经过的街道两旁，排列着一眼望不到头的、密密层层的人群。这时，克拉科夫市万人空巷，男女老少都在满天雪花飞舞的大街上，热烈欢迎中国的客人们。人们纷纷向代表团招手，车辆一过，欢呼声随着代表团的车辆到处荡漾。街道上到处挂着“中波友谊万岁！”“热烈欢迎周恩来总理！”的大幅标语。很多作父亲的把孩子高高举起，孩子们挥着小手欢喜地向中国客人致意。一位老工人热情地握着中国同志的手，对他的小儿子说：“看！我们住在地球那边的朋友们来看望我们来了。敬礼！亲爱的中国同志们。”游览克拉科夫以后，代表团前往离克拉科夫十多公里的诺瓦胡塔城和列宁冶金联合企业参观。
