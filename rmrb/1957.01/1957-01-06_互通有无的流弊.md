    The Drawbacks of Barter

    The practice of barter between Party A and Party B, exchanging goods they have, was originally a good thing when material supplies were tight. It mobilized some enterprises to exchange surplus and idle materials. However, this practice has been misunderstood by some units, resulting in a situation where if you want to get the surplus materials from another unit, you must prepare materials that others need in exchange.

    For example, the First Ministry of Machine Building urgently needed seamless steel pipes, while the Ministry of Petroleum Industry had more than 200 tons in surplus, but insisted on exchanging them for 15K steel plates. The First Ministry of Machine Building ultimately failed to make the deal because it did not have 15K steel plates. When Guangzhou General Machinery Factory was manufacturing sugar making machines, it had to use steel plates instead of these steel pipes because it could not exchange for them, resulting in waste.

    Due to the serious departmentalism and capitalist management viewpoints of some units, not only have they failed to dispose of their surplus and idle materials, but they have also created a false impression of material shortages; on the one hand, there is serious stockpiling, and on the other hand, there is a feeling of inadequacy. Now, this has even developed to the point where even wire nails, iron wire, lamp stands, and scales must be exchanged for goods.

    I suggest that the surplus materials of some departments should be managed and allocated uniformly by the competent authorities according to the principle of prioritizing urgency. The commercial departments should abolish the principle of barter exchange and should supply the needs of the market in a planned and purposeful manner.

### 互通有无的流弊

    互通有无的流弊
    甲乙双方互通有无，这种做法在材料供应紧张的情况下，动员了某些企业把多余呆滞物资，进行交换，本来是件好事。然而这种作法却被一些单位理解错了，结果形成你要想得到别的单位的多余物资，就非得准备有别人需要的物资去换不行。
    如第一机械工业部迫切需要无缝钢管，而石油工业部却多余二百多吨，但非要以十五K钢板来交换。第一机械工业部终因没有十五K钢板未能成交。广州通用机器厂在制造制糖机时，由于换不到这种钢管而不得不用钢板来代替，结果造成了浪费。
    由于某些单位有着严重的本位主义和资本主义的经营观点，不但没有处理自己的多余呆滞物资，且造成了物资不足的虚假现象；一方严重的积压，一方又感到不足，而现在又发展到连洋钉，铁丝，灯架，磅秤等，也非得拿货去换不行。
    我建议某些部门的多余物资，应由主管单位根据轻重缓急的原则，进行统一的管理和调拨。在商业部门应取消以物易物的交换原则，应有计划有目的地供应市场上的需要。
