Ice Fishing

    In the severe winter, the temperature in Qiqihar City drops to minus thirty degrees Celsius. Despite the biting cold, the fishermen of Qiqihar City are active on the Nenjiang River, braving wind and snow to engage in ice fishing.

    More than 300 fishermen from the city's four fishery production cooperatives, in order to ensure that people can eat fresh fish in winter, have purchased fishing gear worth more than 13,900 yuan this year, planning to catch 910,000 jin of fish in winter.

    After the river froze in October last year, they began to cast their nets and fish. In more than two months, they have caught 466,000 jin of fish, which has met market demand. Ding Fengling photographed (Qiqihar Daily manuscript)

    冰下捕鱼
    严冬季节，齐齐哈尔市的气温下降到零下三十度。在这寒气逼人的时候，齐齐哈尔市的渔民们却活跃在嫩江江面上，冒着风雪进行冰下捕鱼。
    全市四个渔业生产合作社的三百多名渔民，为了使人们能在冬季吃到鲜鱼，今年购置了价值一万三千九百多元的渔具，计划冬季捕鱼九十一万斤。
    去年10月封冻以后开始下网捕鱼，两个多月已捕获四十六万六千斤鱼，供给了市场需要。　　　　丁凤岭摄（齐齐哈尔日报稿）
