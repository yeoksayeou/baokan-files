Xinhua News Agency, January 25th - According to TASS reports: Some leaders of the Communist Party and government of the Soviet Union have made extensive and in-depth inspections of many collective farms and industrial enterprises in the past two weeks, and have contacted many agricultural laborers, workers and intellectuals in various places.

The Soviet leaders took advantage of the opportunity to award medals to some republics, border regions, states, and advanced laborers to conduct inspections in various places. They were Voroshilov, Bulganin, Khrushchev, Kaganovich, Malenkov, Mikoyan, Molotov, Suslov, Brezhnev, Aristov, Belyaev and others. During this period, they went to the eastern regions of the Russian Federation, and the Kazakh and Central Asian republics. Most of these places are newly reclaimed areas and new industrial bases, and are inhabited by many ethnic groups.

During their visits and tours in various places, the Soviet leaders learned in detail about the work, production and living conditions of the working people, and put forward some opinions on local industrial and agricultural production and various aspects of work.

When Khrushchev visited the Lenin Collective Farm in Kara-Suu District in Uzbekistan, he met with Musa Muhammadov, a representative of the Supreme Soviet of Uzbekistan and a well-known grape grower. He was very interested in the question of whether grapes are profitable in agriculture, and he believed that it is best to calculate the income per hectare of land to determine how much a crop earns. The chairman of the collective farm told him that last year the income from the collective farm's vineyard accounted for a quarter of the collective farm's annual income. Khrushchev expressed his satisfaction with this. When Khrushchev inspected the "Alamaikin" tribal state-owned farm in the Alato Mountains of Kyrgyzstan, he learned that only one kind of fodder beet was planted here. He pointed out that sugar beets with more nutrients and more sugar should be planted to feed livestock.

Voroshilov inspected a grain state-owned farm that had grown up two years ago on the banks of the Kaskelen River in Kazakhstan. He visited workers' residences, dairy farms, cowsheds, and granaries. Voroshilov also visited the Central Geological Museum of the Kazakh Academy of Sciences in Almaty, the capital of the republic. He had cordial talks with the scientists and hoped that they would make use of the rich mineral deposits here as soon as possible and more fully.

Bulganin talked with animal husbandry workers in the Chkalov and Lenin Collective Farms in the Kubyshev District of Tajikistan. He was very interested in the situation of livestock and feed bases, and was very concerned about the living conditions of the shepherds.

Suslov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, learned from the agricultural workers in the "Decemberist" state-owned farm in the Yershov District of Saratov Oblast that the farm, which was established more than two years ago after reclamation, harvested a large amount of grain last year. He asked the farm workers to do everything possible to develop the still backward animal husbandry here this year. Suslov also learned about the work of the workers' canteen in the Lenin District, the largest industrial area in Saratov.

Mikoyan visited the Khrushchev Collective Farm in the Mari District of the Turkmen Republic. He asked the farm management committee, the heads of the Party and the Communist Youth League about the completion of the cotton delivery plan and the prospects for the development of the collective farm, and learned about the work of the cotton planting team, the villagers, and the tractor drivers.

Aristov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, said to the leaders of the Sokolov Coal Mine in the Kustanai Oblast of Kazakhstan after visiting the open-pit mine that it is necessary to build a concentrator and a heating center as soon as possible, and to always pay attention to the working conditions of the miners and further build well-equipped houses.

The Soviet leaders were warmly received and welcomed everywhere they went like family members. The working people in various places were very enthusiastic and kind when they came into contact with them. Many people invited them to their homes as guests, or seized opportunities to talk with them on various occasions. When Molotov was in the Voronezh Oblast, he was invited to her home as a guest by Chernykh, the famous production team leader and socialist labor hero of the Stalin Collective Farm. When he arrived at this collective farm, many people came to talk with Molotov sincerely. The milkmaids invited him to the red corner (small club) of the dairy farm to tell him about their work. When Malenkov arrived at the Chebenika State Farm in the Chkalov Oblast, many farmers braved the severe cold and brought bread and salt to the station to greet him. After inquiring in detail about the workers' cultural living conditions, trade and food organization in various parts of the farm, he was invited to have dinner at his new home by an old worker, Zakharov, and they talked until late at night.

During their visits to various places, the Soviet leaders explained and interpreted the current domestic and foreign policies of the Party and the state to the working people. In addition to giving long speeches at the congresses of the republics and states to talk about these issues, they also tried their best to explain these aspects in mass meetings and individual talks in collective farms, farms, and factories. The working people in various places were satisfied that the leaders of the Soviet Party and government came to understand their work and living conditions. They all expressed that they would do their best to produce more products.

    了解劳动人民的工作、生产和生活情况
    苏联领导人深入下层视察工作
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联共产党和政府的一些领导人在过去的两个星期中，到许多农庄和工业企业作了广泛而深入的视察，同各地许多农业劳动者、工人和知识分子进行了接触。
    苏联领导人是利用到各地对一些共和国、边疆区、州和先进的劳动者授勋的机会进行视察的。他们是伏罗希洛夫、布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫、卡冈诺维奇、马林科夫、米高扬、莫洛托夫、苏斯洛夫、勃列日涅夫、阿里斯托夫、别利亚耶夫等。在这期间，他们分别到了俄罗斯联邦的东部地区、哈萨克和中亚细亚各共和国。那里大部分地方是新开垦区和新的工业基地，并且是多民族居住的地方。
    苏联领导人在各地访问和参观当中，详细了解了劳动人民的工作、生产和生活的情况，并且对当地工农业生产和各方面工作提出了一些意见。
    赫鲁晓夫在乌兹别克访问卡拉苏伊区列宁集体农场的时候，同乌兹别克最高苏维埃代表、著名的葡萄种植者穆萨穆哈麦多夫见了面。他对葡萄在农业中是不是有利可图的问题很感兴趣，他认为确定一种农作物赢利多少最好是统计每公顷土地上的收入。农庄主席告诉他说，去年农庄的葡萄园的收入占农庄全年收入的四分之一。赫鲁晓夫对这很表满意。当赫鲁晓夫在吉尔吉斯阿拉托山脉的“阿拉麦金”部落国营农场视察的时候，他知道这里只种植一种饲用甜菜，他指出应当种植更富营养、含糖很多的糖用甜菜来饲养牲畜。
    伏罗希洛夫在哈萨克视察了卡斯克伦河畔的一个两年前成长起来的谷物国营农场。他参观了工人的住宅、乳牛场、牛舍和谷仓等。伏罗希洛夫还在这个共和国的首都阿拉木图访问了哈萨克科学院中央地质博物馆，他同科学家们进行了亲切的交谈，希望他们尽快地和更加充分地把这里的丰富矿藏利用起来。
    布尔加宁在塔吉克古比雪夫区的契卡洛夫和列宁集体农庄，同畜牧工作者进行了谈话，他对牲畜和饲料基地的情况很感兴趣，并且对牧羊人的生活状况甚为关心。
    苏共中央书记苏斯洛夫在萨拉托夫州叶尔绍夫区“十二月党人”国营农场同农业工人的谈话中，知道这个两年多前垦荒后成立起来的农场去年收获了大量的谷物，他要求农场工人在今年必须用一切办法发展这里还落后的畜牧业。苏斯洛夫还在萨拉托夫最大的工业区——列宁区了解了工厂中工人食堂的工作情况。
    米高扬在土库曼共和国马里区参观了赫鲁晓夫集体农庄，他向农庄管理委员会、党和共青团的负责人问到完成棉花交售计划的情况和农庄发展的前景，了解了植棉工作队、庄员和拖拉机驾驶者工作情况。
    苏共中央书记阿里斯托夫在哈萨克库斯坦奈州参观索科洛夫煤矿的露天矿场以后对矿山的领导人说，必须尽快地建设选矿厂和电热中心，经常关心矿工的劳动条件和进一步建设设备良好的住宅。
    苏联领导人到处受到人们亲如家人的接待和欢迎。各地劳动人民同他们接触的时候都是十分热烈而亲切的。许多人请他们到自己家里去作客，或者在各种场合争取机会同他们进行谈话。莫洛托夫在沃罗涅日州的时候，被斯大林集体农庄的著名生产组长、社会主义劳动英雄契尔尼赫邀请到她家里去作客。到了这个集体农庄，许多人都来同莫洛托夫进行倾心的谈话，挤奶员把他请到奶牛场的红角（小型俱乐部）里，讲述她们的劳动情况。马林科夫到达契卡洛夫州的契别尼卡国营农场去的时候，许多农民冒着严寒带着面包和盐到车站上来迎接他。他在农场的各部分详细询问了工人文化生活条件、贸易和伙食的组织情况以后，被一位老工人扎哈罗夫邀请到他的新居去吃晚饭，他们一直谈到深夜。
    苏联领导人在各地访问的时候，把党和国家当前的对内和对外政策向劳动人民作了说明和解释。他们除了在共和国和州的大会上发表长篇演说来谈这些问题以外，还在农庄、农场和工厂的群众大会上和个别的谈话中，尽量来说明这些方面的问题。各地的劳动人民对苏联党和政府的领导人来了解他们的工作和生活情况感到满意。他们都表示将竭尽全力，争取生产更多的产品。
