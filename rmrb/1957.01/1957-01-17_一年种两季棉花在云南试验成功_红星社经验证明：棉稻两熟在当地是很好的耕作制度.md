Xinhua News Agency, Kunming – A successful trial of growing two seasons of cotton a year has been achieved at the Nujiang Agricultural Experiment Station in Yunnan Province.

In early spring 1956, the Nujiang Agricultural Experiment Station sowed nine fen of land with the "373" cotton, a fine Yunnan Province variety. By the time the cotton matured in August, 112 jin of ginned cotton had been harvested. Following this, the experiment station, based on local natural conditions, used the cotton seeds harvested from these nine fen of land for seedling cultivation and direct sowing, planting 160 mu of second-season cotton. These cotton plants are currently being harvested, and it is expected that the harvest will be completed by the end of January, with an estimated average yield of about 50 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Among them, the three and a half mu of cotton that has already been harvested has an average yield of up to 80 jin of ginned cotton per mu.

While sowing the second-season cotton, the original nine fen of cotton plants were pruned and fertilized, cultivated into ratoon cotton. The ratoon cotton was harvested earlier, and all of it was picked by the end of December. These nine fen yielded another 59 jin of ginned cotton.

The Nujiang Agricultural Experiment Station is located in the hilly area on the west bank of the Nujiang River, backed by the Gaoligong Mountains. The temperature here is relatively high throughout the year, with only two or three days of slight frost in winter. The mountain streams irrigate the experiment station’s land all year round. In the process of trying to grow two seasons of cotton, the experiment station made use of the above favorable conditions and adopted technical measures such as increasing fertilizer application and controlling pests and diseases.

This newspaper reports that the experience of the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative in Yongsheng County, Yunnan Province, proves that cotton-rice double cropping is an excellent farming system. Last year, this cooperative planted rice after cotton on more than 1,400 mu of cotton fields, averaging 80 jin of ginned cotton and more than 200 jin of rice per mu; the high rice yields even reached 500 jin.

This cooperative is located in the Jinsha River valley, at an altitude of more than 1,200 meters, with a frost-free period of about 300 days a year. The land is fertile and suitable for planting cotton and rice. Every year after the cotton bolls are picked after Minor Heat, the land is immediately plowed, and the seedlings are transplanted during Major Heat and the Beginning of Autumn, and harvested by the Beginning of Winter. Yi Guanghong, a local farmer, had tried planting rice after cotton in 1948, but it was not widely promoted; the yield was also low, with even the high-yielding ones only producing more than 40 jin of ginned cotton and 300 jin of rice per mu. In 1955, he introduced this experience, and more farmers began to try planting it. Last year, after the entire township became cooperative, the cooperative decided to plant it on a large scale and exchanged for the late-maturing and early-ripening fine variety "Maoxian Gu" from Binchuan County, which greatly increased the yield.

This farming system has many advantages, as it can increase income, reduce cotton pests and diseases, and solve the grain problem and livestock feed problem in cotton-producing areas.

### 一年种两季棉花在云南试验成功  红星社经验证明：棉稻两熟在当地是很好的耕作制度

    一年种两季棉花在云南试验成功
    红星社经验证明：棉稻两熟在当地是很好的耕作制度
    据新华社昆明电　一年种两季棉花，在云南省怒江农业试验场试验成功了。
    怒江农业试验场在1956年初春播种了九分地云南省的“三七三”棉花良种。到8月棉花成熟的时候，收获了一百一十二斤皮棉。接着试验场又根据当地的自然条件，用这九分地上收获的棉籽育苗、直播，种植了一百六十亩第二季棉花。目前这些棉花已经开始收获，大约到1月底才能收完，预计每亩平均产量可以达到皮棉五十斤左右。其中已经收完的三亩半棉花，平均每亩产皮棉高达八十斤。
    在播种第二季棉花的同时，原来的九分地棉花又被整枝和追肥，培育成了再生棉。再生棉收获时间较早，到12月下旬已经全部收摘完毕。这九分地又收了五十九斤皮棉。
    怒江农业试验场位于怒江西岸的丘陵地带，背靠高黎贡山余脉。这里全年气温较高，在冬季也只有两三天有微霜。山上的溪水终年不息地灌溉着试验场的土地。在试种两季棉花的过程中，试验场除利用以上有利条件，还采取了增施肥料、防治虫害等技术措施。
    本报讯　云南省永胜县红星农业社的经验证明，棉稻两熟是一种很好的耕作制度。去年，这个社在一千四百多亩棉田里种了棉后稻，平均每亩产皮棉八十斤，稻谷两百多斤；稻谷产量高的还有达五百斤的。
    这个社在金沙江的河谷里，海拔一千二百多公尺，一年无霜期约为三百天，土地肥沃，适合种植棉花和稻谷。每年小暑后摘了棉桃，立即耕犁，在大暑、立秋的时候把秧栽下，到立冬收割。当地农民易光鸿在1948年就试种过棉后稻，但没有推广；产量也较低，每亩产量高的也只有皮棉四十多斤，稻谷三百几十斤。1955年，他介绍了这一经验，才有较多的农民开始试种。去年全乡合作化以后，社里决定大面积种植，并到宾川县换来迟种早熟的良种“毛线谷”，使产量有很大的提高。
    这一耕作制度有许多优点，既可以增加收入，又可以减少棉花的病虫害，并可以解决棉花产区的粮食问题和牲口饲料问题。
