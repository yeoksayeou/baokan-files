Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 13th: The Shanghai Knitting and Cotton Weaving Factory has begun to gradually implement new product quality inspection standards, so that consumers can buy goods that are both beautiful and durable.

    In the past, all knitting and cotton weaving factories lacked definite quality standards. There were only standards for inspecting and accepting goods set by commercial departments. Some of these standards were excessively general, others were unreasonable, and a large proportion only focused on checking the appearance of the products, lacking supervision of the product's durability, etc. After these factories all became joint state-private enterprises at the beginning of last year, each industry, under the leadership of specialized companies, organized efforts to formulate new quality standards to be self-assessed by the industrial departments.

    The greatest characteristic of the new quality standards is that they not only reasonably stipulate the appearance quality of the products, but also stipulate the inherent durability of the products, etc.

    It is understood that this is only part of the measures taken by the Shanghai local textile industry this year to improve product quality. In order to improve product quality, the Municipal Textile Industry Bureau newly built eight experimental laboratories within the bureau and its affiliated specialized companies last year, and more than one hundred central factories also established laboratories last year. This year, more than one-third of the bureau's capital construction investment is earmarked for improving quality.

    既要美观又要耐用
    据新华社上海13日电　上海针棉织品工厂开始逐步试行新的产品质量检验标准，以便让消费者能买到既美观，又耐穿耐用的商品。
    以往，针棉织品工厂全部没有一定的质量标准。只有商业部门制定的检收货物的标准，这些标准有的过分笼统，有的不合理，而且，很大部分只注意检查产品的外观，对产品的坚牢度等缺少监督。去年初，这些厂全部公私合营以后，各行业都在专业公司领导下组织力量，制定了新的由工业部门自行考核的质量标准。
    新质量标准的最大特点是不仅合理地规定了产品的外观质量，同时规定了产品应有的坚牢度等。
    据了解：这只是上海地方纺织工业今年提高产品质量措施的一部分。为了改进产品质量，市纺织工业局去年在局和所属专业公司内新建了八个试验化验室，一百多个中心厂去年也设立了化验间；今年，全局的基本建设投资规定有三分之一以上用于提高质量方面。
