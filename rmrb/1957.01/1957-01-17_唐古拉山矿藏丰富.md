Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 16th - Geological exploration teams from the Northwest Geological Bureau and the Tibet Geological Bureau have conducted explorations in the Tanggula Mountain region on the border of Tibet and Qinghai for the past year. Preliminary results show that the region is extremely rich in mineral deposits.

The two iron ore deposits discovered by the exploration team in the Tanggula Mountains have both reached a thickness suitable for mining, and the ore veins are concentrated, of high grade, and widely distributed. Six oil-bearing structures were discovered in the southwest foothills of the Tanggula Mountains. These oil-bearing structures are generally well-sealed and structurally complete. A coalfield was discovered in the Shimagela area, 5,300 meters above sea level. The coal samples are lumpy and suitable for coking. Three crystal deposits were discovered in the glaciers of the Tanggula Mountains. The main mineral body of these crystals is white crystal, which is abundant and highly transparent, making it a good raw material for manufacturing optical instruments.

In addition, the exploration team also discovered various minerals such as lead, zinc, manganese, and gypsum.

    唐古拉山矿藏丰富
    新华社拉萨16日电　西藏、青海边境的唐古拉山地区，经西北地质局和西藏地质局地质勘察队一年来的勘察，初步证明矿藏十分丰富。
    勘察队在唐古拉山发现的两个铁矿床，都达到了可以开采的厚度，并且矿脉集中、品位高，分布范围广。在唐古拉山西南麓地区，发现了六个储油构造。这些储油构造一般都封闭良好，构造完整。在拔海五千三百公尺的士玛格拉地区，发现了煤田，煤苗都是块粒状，可供炼焦用。在唐古拉山的冰川里，发现了三个水晶矿床，这些水晶矿的主要矿体是白晶矿，储藏丰富，透明程度很高，是制造光学仪器的良好原料。
    此外，勘察队还发现铅、锌、锰、石膏等矿产多种。
