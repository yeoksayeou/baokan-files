Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 27th: At the recent Chengdu First Excellent Teacher Conference for Middle and Primary Schools, the Chengdu Education Bureau commended many schools and teachers who have adhered to the principle of thrift and economy in running schools.

Chengdu Junior Third Middle School, which was commended, is a model for implementing the principle of "spending less money, doing more, and doing things well." This school used the money to buy thirty sets of double-person experimental tables and chairs and made sixty sets of such tables and chairs by themselves. They spent more than 40 yuan to establish a meteorological observation station that originally required about 150 yuan. The school's sports equipment has increased from the original six types and eight pieces to eight types and twenty-six pieces in the past two years, all of which were self-made from self-purchased materials or used materials, which is estimated to save nearly 500 yuan. In the past year, the school has also adopted methods of saving office expenses to add more than 300 pieces of tools worth about 1,000 yuan to the school's metalworking and woodworking factories, so that each student has a set of basic metalworking or woodworking tools when attending practical classes.

The office expenses of all primary schools in the West District in January 1957 were also the surplus of the school's office expenses in 1956.

Many other schools have also made do and solved the difficulties of teaching equipment by themselves. For example, using thatched huts as classrooms and running schools in dilapidated temples; a corridor is both the teacher's cafeteria and the student's laboratory; a room is both an office and a dormitory; in teaching, using washbasins and earthenware bowls instead of experimental sinks, and using sandbags and meter sticks instead of experimental weights and levers, the schools are also run very well.

Some teachers who made teaching aids were also commended. For example, Li Yaobin, a physics teacher at the Tenth Middle School, prepared and created 110 pieces of intuitive teaching aids; Zhou Taijin, a teacher at the Thirteenth Middle School, also made ten kinds of relatively complex mathematics teaching aids such as "alignment theodolites," "slide rules," and "small plane tables" according to the needs of teaching.

The Education Bureau also commended the excellent work style of mutual support among many schools, thereby improving the utilization rate of school building equipment. In the second semester of 1956, many schools in Chengdu adopted the method of cooperating with each other and borrowing instruments and specimens to solve the difficulties of insufficient equipment. Many schools actively took out unused or less commonly used instruments from their schools to donate to other schools according to the principle of "using surplus to make up for deficiency." Ten schools in the city donated more than 170 instruments to other schools. Chengdu Sixteenth Middle School took the initiative to donate 44 instruments to other schools, including more valuable ammeters, voltmeters, vacuum pumps, and balances.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 27th: The recent Second Heilongjiang Provincial Excellent Teacher Representative Conference called on teachers throughout the province to strengthen the political and ideological education and labor education of students.

The conference rewarded 800 outstanding teachers from the province.

    成都市举行优秀教师会议
    表扬勤俭办学的学校和教师
    新华社成都27日电　在最近召开的成都市第一次中等、初等学校优秀教师会议上，成都市教育局表扬了许多坚持勤俭办学的学校和教师。
    受到表扬的成都初级第三中学，是贯彻“少花钱、多办事、事办好”原则的模范。这个学校用买三十套双人用的实验桌椅的钱，自己动手作了六十套这种桌椅。他们花了四十多元建立了原来需要一百五十元左右的气象观测站。这个学校的体育用具，两年来从原有的六种八件增加到八种二十六件，都是自购材料或利用旧材料自制的，估计节约近五百元。一年来，学校还采用节约办公用费的方法，为校内金工、木工工厂添置了三百多件价值一千元左右的工具，使每个学生上实习课时，都有一套金工或木工的基本工具。
    西城区所有的小学，1957年1月份的办公用费，也都是1956年学校办公费的节余。
    还有许多学校因陋就简，自己动手解决教学设备困难。例如：以茅草屋当教室，在破庙宇内办学校；一条过道，既是教师的食堂，又是学生的实验室；一间屋子，既是办公室，也是寝室；在教学上，用洗脸盆、瓦钵代替实验用的水槽，用沙袋、米突尺代替实验用的法码和杠杆，这样也把学校办得很好。
    一些制作教学用具的教师们也受到了表扬。如第十中学物理教师李尧彬，就配制和创制直观教具一百一十件；第十三中学教师周泰金，也根据教学上的需要，制作了“照准经纬仪”、“计算尺”、“小平板仪”等十种比较复杂的数学教学用具。
    教育局还表扬了许多学校之间的相互支援，因而提高校舍设备使用率的优良作风。1956年下学期，成都市许多学校采取彼此合作，互相借用仪器标本的办法，解决了设备不足的困难。许多学校根据“以有余补不足”的原则，积极拿出本校不用的或不常用的仪器来赠送其他学校。全市有十所学校共拿出一百七十多件仪器赠送给别的学校。成都第十六中学就主动拿出四十四件仪器赠给别的学校，其中有比较贵重的安培计、伏特计、抽气机和天平等。
    据新华社哈尔滨27日电　最近举行的黑龙江省第二次优秀教师代表大会，号召全省教师加强对学生的政治思想教育和劳动教育工作。
    这次会议奖励了全省八百位优秀教师。
