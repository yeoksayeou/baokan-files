    Visiting the Kucong People in the Primeval Forest
    The Jinping County ethnic minority visiting delegation, which will visit the Kucong people in the Ailao Mountains, left the county seat on the 23rd, and will arrive at its destination before the Spring Festival.
    The visiting delegation will celebrate the Spring Festival with the Kucong people on the edge of the primeval forest and with those who have settled down, and will publicize the Party's ethnic policies to them. After the Spring Festival, in addition to a small number of members staying behind to continue helping them with their work, most of the members will go deep into the misty, towering old-growth forests, using machetes to clear roads through the vines, kudzu, and mao bamboo, searching for those Kucong people who are still trapped in the forests and helping them to settle down.

    到原始森林访问苦聪人
    到哀牢山上去访问苦聪人的金平县民族访问团，23日离开县城，将在春节前赶到目的地。
    访问团将在原始森林的边缘和定居的苦聪人在一起欢度春节，并且向他们宣传党的民族政策。春节过后，除小部分团员留下继续帮助他们工作以外，大多数的团员将要钻进浓雾弥漫、树木参天的深山老林，用弯刀从藤葛、毛竹中开辟道路，寻找那些还困处在森林中的苦聪人，帮助他们定居下来。
