Worry Amidst Celebration

In Gucheng County, Hubei Province, there were one hundred and twelve agricultural cooperatives that were "production reduction cooperatives," but recently seventy-three of them suddenly became "production increase cooperatives." How could such a strange thing happen?

It turns out that when the agricultural cooperatives in Gucheng County were carrying out the 1956 distribution and final accounting, they mobilized the cooperative members to thoroughly take stock of the warehouses and check the accounts, and newly "discovered" a large amount of property that people did not know about. According to statistics from two hundred and ninety-eight cooperatives, a total of 740,000 jin of accumulated wheat, 2,170,000 jin of rice, and 1,500,000 jin of other miscellaneous grains were found, as well as 180,000 jin of cotton and 150,000 yuan in cash. Before the stocktaking and account checking, one hundred and twelve of these cooperatives were considered "production reduction cooperatives"; afterwards, seventy-three of them became "production increase cooperatives." After the Dongfeng Agricultural Cooperative carried out the stocktaking and account checking, each household received an average of 40 yuan more, and the household with the most received 110 yuan more.

This county is not the only one that has found a large amount of wealth. In the Jingzhou Special Zone of this province, two hundred and fifteen cooperatives have found that production teams collectively concealed more than 100,000 jin of grain in hidden yields and unclear inventories, and found two hundred and fifty-six items of omitted and misrecorded accounts. It is possible that some of these cooperatives have been able to remove the "production reduction cooperative" label thanks to the maintenance of stocktaking and account checking work!

People are happy for these cooperatives that have found a large amount of wealth, but at the same time, they are worried about their usual property management. While the crash stocktaking and account checking played a significant role, it is even more important to strengthen management on a regular basis. Managing all collectively owned property in an orderly manner, having a clear understanding of the cooperative's assets and liabilities—that is what a shrewd housekeeper does.

### 庆幸之中的担心

    庆幸之中的担心
    湖北省谷城县有一百一十二个社是“减产社”，可是最近其中的七十三个社忽然变成了“增产社”。怎么会有这样奇怪的事呢？
    原来谷城县各地农业社在进行1956年分配决算的时候，发动社员群众，彻底盘点了仓库，清查了账目，新“发现”了人们所不知道的大量资财。据二百九十八个社统计，共查出积存的小麦七十四万斤、稻谷二百一十七万斤、其他杂粮一百五十万斤，还有棉花十八万斤、现金十五万元。在清仓查账之前，这些合作社中有一百一十二个社被认为是“减产社”；之后，有七十三个社就变成“增产社”了。东升农业社清仓查账以后，平均每户又收入四十元，最多的一户又进钱一百一十元。
    查出大量财宝的，不止这个县。这个省的荆州专区有二百十五个社已查出生产队集体隐瞒产量和库存不清的粮食十万多斤，查出漏记和记错的账目二百五十六项。说不定在这些合作社里也有一些社幸赖清仓查账工作的维护而摘掉了“减产社”的帽子！
    人们一方面为这些查出了大量财宝的合作社庆幸，一方面为他们平时的财产管理状况担心。突击清仓查账固然起了很大作用，但是，平时加强管理更其重要。把集体所有的财产管理得有条不紊，对于全社的资产负债了若指掌，——这才是精明的管家人。
