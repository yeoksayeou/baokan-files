Title: What is “Intervening in Life”?

The phrase "intervening in life," when used together, seems to be a recent development. The first time I saw this term, it gave me a refreshing impression. At the time, everyone felt that our literary and artistic creation had a tendency to deviate from life. In order to change this situation and address the problem, emphasizing the necessity of "intervening in life" was indeed a smart move.

Yes, the so-called "intervening in life" probably has a meaning opposite to that of being detached from life. The essence of literary and artistic creation is to reflect life and transform life, and this "reflection" and "transformation" are, of course, a kind of intervention. Conversely, "intervening in life" probably means reflecting life and transforming life, and it seems that there is no other content besides this.

However, somehow, a term can become distorted after being used for a long time. Isn't that so? In the minds of some authors, this "intervening in life" has become synonymous with "exposing the dark side of life." Therefore, since not "intervening in life" violates the fundamental principles of socialist realism in literature and art, works that do not "expose the dark side of life" are not socialist realism literature and art. Look, works that "expose the dark side of life" may become fashionable again.

Here, I must state that I am not saying that literary and artistic works should not "expose the dark side of life"; nor am I saying that there is too much "exposure of the dark side of life" now, and that it has become a bias that must be stopped. No, on the contrary, since there is a dark side in life, it should be exposed. Moreover, the criticisms of some of our mistakes in current literary works are far from sharp enough, let alone too many. How much we need the real fire of criticism to burn away the "dark side" of life! I am only saying that "intervening in life" and "exposing the dark side of life" are not the same thing, and the phrase "intervening in life" is much broader in content than the phrase "exposing the dark side of life."

"Exposing the dark side of life" (while guiding people to fight against it) is naturally "intervening in life"; but isn't "praising the bright side of life" also "intervening in life"? In our practical work, we often say: promote strengths and overcome weaknesses to push our cause forward. I think it's not unprofessional to use these words in literature and art. "Praising the bright side of life," guiding people to cherish this bright side, learn from it, and fight for it, how can you say it's not "intervening in life"?

Moreover, any upright and discerning person can admit that in our lives, the "dark side" is not the dominant and fundamental thing, but the "bright side" is the dominant and fundamental thing. Since this is the case, then I still feel that "praising the bright side of life" is the main meaning of "intervening in life," and the primary task of literature and art (not each individual piece, but the entirety of literature and art). If we say this, someone may immediately shout: "Vulgar sociology, too simple!" No, the truth is often simple, but it is vulgar sociology or something even worse than vulgar sociology that always simplifies complex problems and complicates simple things.

More importantly, even when "exposing the dark side of life," one must have a deep understanding of the whole of life. The "dark side" cannot be simply "hunted," like a hunter going into the woods to hunt rabbits, selling one in the market after catching it. The "dark side" is not foreign either, grabbing a foreign bureaucrat and dressing him in Chinese cadre clothes, making him say a few Chinese words; nor does the person representing the "dark side" necessarily follow age, as in some works, young people are always advanced, old people are striving, and only middle-aged people who are neither old nor young have declining enthusiasm. ...Is what is "exposed" by this kind of method really the "dark side of life"? Not likely at all! To understand life, that is, to understand both the "dark side" and the "bright side." Life is a whole, and the "bright side" and "dark side" of life are always intertwined and constantly fighting. If you don't understand, don't love, and aren't interested in this "bright side," and yet you want to "expose the dark side of life" -- intervene in life, then I really don't know what the result of "intervening" in life will be. It's like a doctor who doesn't know what a healthy person looks like and yet wants to treat diseases, I'm afraid even the patient's ears and nose will be "cured" off.

No, saying that one doesn't understand, doesn't love, and isn't interested in the "bright side" is just a hypothesis. In fact, every author has a "bright side" that he understands, loves, and is interested in. This bright side is readily available, prepared long ago by the old world. The "bright side" valued by the bourgeoisie can immediately replace the true "bright side" of the working class and other working people. Then, in many cases (though not all), what such authors expose is precisely the true "bright side of life." Thus, the so-called "intervening in life," this beautiful banner, is not so easy to display.

I've gone too far, let's bring it back. What I most hope is that we still use the quality of the works -- first of all, the breadth and depth of reflecting life -- as the goal, and not make "exposing the dark side of life" fashionable!

### 何谓“干预生活”？

    何谓“干预生活”？
    马铁丁
    “干预生活”这四个字连在一起应用，好像只是近年来的事。最先看到这句术语的时候，给我一种清新的印象。当时，大家都感到，我们的文艺创作存在着脱离生活的倾向，为了改变这种情形，对症下药，强调一下“干预生活”的必要，确实是一桩聪明的举动。
    是的，所谓“干预生活”，恐怕也就是与脱离生活相对立的一种含义。文艺创作的特质，就是要反映生活、改造生活，这种“反映”和“改造”，当然也是一种干预。反过来，“干预生活”，恐怕也就是反映生活和改造生活的意思，除此以外，好像也找不到别的内容。
    可是，不知怎的，一句术语用得久了，有时就会走了样。不是吗？这个“干预生活”，在一部分作者的心目中，竟成了“揭露生活中的阴暗面”的同义语。于是乎，既然不“干预生活”就违反了社会主义现实主义文艺的根本原则，那么，不“揭露生活中的阴暗面”的作品，也就不是社会主义现实主义的文艺了。看吧，“揭露生活中的阴暗面”的作品，也许又要时兴了。
    这里非声明一下不可：我不是说，文艺作品不应当“揭露生活中的阴暗面”；也不是说，现在“揭露生活中的阴暗面”太多了，已经成为偏向，必须就此打住。不是的，正好相反，既然生活中有阴暗面，那就应该揭露，而且，现在的文学作品中对我们的一些错误批评得还远不算尖锐，更不算多。我们是多么需要那种真正的批评的烈火，把生活中的“阴暗面”给以烧毁呵！我只是说，“干预生活”和“揭露生活中的阴暗面”并不是相等的东西，“干预生活”这句话比“揭露生活中的阴暗面”这句话的内容广泛得多。
    “揭露生活中的阴暗面”（同时还要引导人们跟它作斗争），自然是“干预生活”；但，“赞扬生活中的光明面”，难道就不是“干预生活”吗？在我们的实际工作中，我们常说：发扬优点，克服缺点，才能把我们的事业推向前进。我想，这样的话用于文学艺术上，也未见得就是外行话。“赞扬生活中的光明面”，引导人们珍视这个光明面，向它学习，为它而斗争，怎能说不是“干预生活”呢？
    而且，任何正直而有判断力的人都可以承认：我们的生活中，并不是“阴暗面”是主导的、基本的东西，而“光明面”才是主导的、基本的东西。既然如此，那么，我还是觉得，“赞扬生活中的光明面”，才是“干预生活”的主要含义，才是文学艺术（不是单个的每一篇，而是文学艺术的整体）的首要任务。我们这样说，也许有人马上大喝一声：“庸俗社会学，太简单了！”不，真理常常是简单的，倒是庸俗社会学或者比庸俗社会学更糟糕的什么学才总把复杂的问题简单化，而又把简单的事情复杂化起来。
    更重要的问题是：就是“揭露生活中的阴暗面”吧，也得对整个生活有点深入的理解。“阴暗面”不能只靠“猎取”，如同猎人到树林子里去打兔子一样，打着一个就到市场上去出卖。“阴暗面”也不是外国来的，抓住一个外国的官僚主义者就让他穿上中国的干部服，说点中国话；代表“阴暗面”的人似乎也不一定以年龄为准，如同某些作品那样，年青人总是先进的，老年人是奋发的，只有不老不少的中年人才是热情衰退的。……靠这一类办法所“揭露”的，就真正是“生活中的阴暗面”吗？一万个不见得！要理解生活，就是说，既要了解“阴暗面”也要了解“光明面”。生活是一个整体，生活中的“光明面”和“阴暗面”总是纠结在一起，而且在不断地斗争着。假如你对这种“光明面”不了解，不爱，不发生兴趣，而又要去“揭露生活中的阴暗面”，——干预生活，那真不知道会把生活“干预”到怎样的结果了。正如一个医生，根本不知道健康人是什么样，却要去治病，那恐怕连病人的耳朵和鼻子都要被“治”掉了。
    不，说对于“光明面”不了解，不爱，不发生兴趣，只是一种假设，事实上，每个作者都有他所了解、所爱、所发生兴趣的“光明面”。这种光明面现成得很，旧世界早给预备好了，资产阶级所看中的“光明面”，立刻就可以代替工人阶级及其它劳动人民的真正的“光明面”。那么，在许多的场合下（尽管不是一切的场合下），这样的作者所揭露的，正好是真正的“生活中的光明面”。于是，那所谓“干预生活”这面标致的旗子，也就不大好亮得出来了。
    话说得远了，还是收回来吧。我最希望的是，还是以作品的质量——首先是反映生活的广度和深度，来作为追求的目标，不要以“揭露生活中的阴暗面”为时兴！
