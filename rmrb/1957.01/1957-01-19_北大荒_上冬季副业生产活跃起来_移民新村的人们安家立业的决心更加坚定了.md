    Winter Sideline Production Becomes Active in "Great Northern Wilderness"; The Determination of People in Immigrant New Villages to Settle Down and Establish a Career is Further Strengthened
    (Our Newspaper) News: Under the active leadership of the Chinese Communist Party committees and People's Committees at all levels in Heilongjiang Province, winter sideline production in more than 400 immigrant new villages in the "Great Northern Wilderness" has become active. Currently, the number of people participating in sideline production accounts for 30% to 50% of the total number of immigrants. For example, in Longjiang County, more than 1,400 immigrants have gone out to engage in sideline production, and 100 large carts have been dispatched. The Harbin Youth Collective Farm in Luobei County organized a sideline production team of 170 people, which arrived at the Hegang Coal Mine a month ago to participate in coal transportation. Twelve rubber-wheeled carts are also running for transportation. The villagers who stayed at home opened up production avenues locally, and organized more than ten kinds of small sideline production such as harvesting sheep grass, cutting branches, weaving baskets, and twisting straw ropes, according to different labor conditions.
    The labor enthusiasm of the immigrants is quite high, and they have obtained considerable income in a short period of time. The grass-cutting team of No. 9 New Village in Chuxiao Township, Yian County, can cut an average of about 200 bundles of grass per person per day. In the past two months, the whole village has cut more than 825,000 bundles of grass, worth more than 40,000 yuan. The women's production team led by Shi Cuiyun of No. 30 New Village in Xuri Township cut more than 400 carts of firewood in twelve days, which can be sold for more than 3,300 yuan. More than 800 reclamation team members from Fuyu County who went to the "93" Farm to work earned a total of more than 155,000 yuan in three or four months. The sideline income of immigrant new villages in Keshan County is expected to reach more than 160,000 yuan in three months, which is equivalent to about half of the total income of the immigrants. The No. 8 New Village production team, which participated in the construction project in Qiqihar City, was rated as a model production unit for exceeding the labor quota, and received a material reward worth 400 yuan. In the two production teams that went to the Fularji construction site, 32 people were rated as advanced producers.
    Due to the widespread development of winter sideline production, the income is increasing day by day, which has greatly encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the immigrants and further strengthened their determination to establish a family business in the Great Northern Wilderness. Some immigrants said excitedly: The Great Northern Wilderness is really a treasure land! (Gu Fei)

    “北大荒”上冬季副业生产活跃起来
    移民新村的人们安家立业的决心更加坚定了
    本报讯　在黑龙江省的中共各级党委和人民委员会的积极领导下，“北大荒”上的四百多个移民新村的冬季副业生产已经活跃起来。目前，参加副业生产的人数，已占移民总数的30％—50％。如龙江县出外搞副业的移民就有一千四百多人，并出动了一百台大车。萝北县的哈尔滨青年集体农庄由一百七十人组成的副业生产大队，早在一个月以前就到达鹤岗煤矿参加了运煤生产。十二台胶轮大车也跑开了运输。留在家里的庄员们，就地开辟生产门路，按着不同的劳动条件，组织起来打羊草、割条子、编筐、拧草绳等十多种小型副业生产。
    移民们的劳动情绪相当高涨，在短短的时间内就获得了可观的收入。依安县初晓乡第九号新村打草队，平均每人一天能打草二百捆左右。全村两个月来共打草八十二万五千多捆，价值四万多元。旭日乡第三十号新村石翠云领导的妇女生产队，十二天内即打烧柴四百多车，可卖三千三百多元。富裕县到“九三”农场做工的八百多名垦荒队员，三、四个月工夫共收入十五万五千多元。克山县的移民新村三个月内的副业收入预计可达十六万元之多，相当于移民总收入的一半左右。到齐齐哈尔市参加工程建设的第八新村生产队，因为超过了劳动定额还被评为模范生产单位，并获得价值四百元的物质奖励。到富拉尔基工地的两个生产队，有三十二人被评为先进生产者。
    由于冬季副业生产的广泛开展，收入一天比一天增多，这就大大鼓舞了移民们的劳动热情，更加坚定了他们在北大荒建立家业的决心。有的移民兴奋地说：北大荒真是块宝地呀！　　　　　（顾非）
