    Unchanged "Change"
    Not long ago, the United States sang a tune about wanting to "change" its foreign policy. Reston, the Washington chief correspondent for "The New York Times," known for his well-informed sources, wrote sensationally on December 27th of last year: "The United States is currently changing its foreign policy once again."

    Reston based this on the United States' two-faced approach in the Egyptian affair and some of Nixon's and others' appeasing speeches. He asserted that due to the Egyptian affair, the United States' "prestige" in the Middle East and Asia had "increased," and therefore, there were "new opportunities" in diplomacy, suitable for winning over "neutral countries, or countries that have not assumed obligations." Reston colorfully said: The United States is now "replacing personnel implementing foreign policy" and even "may withdraw troops from Europe," its policy "shift is clearly visible."

    However, Mr. Reston was fooled this time. Two or three days after his article was published, the United States' once-touted cries of "opposing colonialism" disappeared, and instead, it clamored for what it called the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The "Eisenhower Doctrine" openly declared to the world that the United States would use both guns and dollars to deal with the people of the Middle Eastern countries. It would neither "abandon" colonialism nor "change" its war policy. To illustrate that the United States' aggressive policy remained unchanged, Dulles also issued a special statement. He said that the United States' current "Eisenhower Doctrine" is a policy that has been inherited from the past "Truman Doctrine," "Marshall Plan," and "North Atlantic Treaty," and that they "have the most fundamental common ground."

    Reston originally wanted to put gold on the face of the United States' notorious aggressive policy so that it could deceive some people, but the Wall Street bosses insisted on revealing their true colonialist colors, which put the sycophantic American journalists in a dilemma.

### 原封不动的“改变”

    原封不动的“改变”
    不久以前，美国曾经唱过一阵它要“改变”外交政策的调子。以消息灵通著称的“纽约时报”驻华盛顿首席记者赖斯顿在去年12月27日就耸人听闻地写道：“美国目前正在再一次改变外交政策”。
    赖斯顿是拿美国在埃及事件中玩弄两面手法和尼克松等人的一些拢络人心的演说来做根据的。他断言：由于埃及事件，美国在中东和亚洲的“威信提高”了，因此，也就在外交方面有了“新的机会”，宜于改变政策去拉拢“中立国家，或者未承担义务的国家。”赖斯顿有声有色地说：美国现在正在“更换执行外交政策的人员”，甚至“有可能从欧洲撤出军队”，它的政策的“转变灼然可见”。
    可是，赖斯顿先生这回上当了。他的文章刊出之后没有两三天，美国一度标榜的“反对殖民主义”的叫喊就消声匿迹了，却大肆喧嚷要搞什么“艾森豪威尔主义”了。“艾森豪威尔主义”公开地向全世界说明，美国要一手拿枪，一手拿美元来对付中东国家人民，它既不“放弃”殖民主义，也不“改变”战争政策。为了说明美国的侵略政策不变，杜勒斯还特别发表了一个声明。他说，美国现在的“艾森豪威尔主义”，就是过去的“杜鲁门主义”、“马歇尔计划”、“北大西洋公约”以来一脉相承的政策，它们“有着最根本的共同点”。
    赖斯顿原想为美国臭名昭著的侵略政策脸上贴金，使它能够欺骗一些人，可是华尔街老板硬要露出殖民主义的本相来，这叫帮闲的美国记者们左右为难了。
