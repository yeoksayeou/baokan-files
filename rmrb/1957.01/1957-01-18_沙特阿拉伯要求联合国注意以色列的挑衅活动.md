Xinhua News Agency, New York, 17th. TASS reported from New York on the 16th: The representative of Saudi Arabia to the United Nations has handed the President of the Security Council and the Secretary-General of the United Nations a letter requesting the United Nations to note the provocative and armed aggression by Israeli armed forces against Saudi Arabia in the Gulf of Aqaba region.

The Saudi Arabian letter stated: Since the start of the armed aggression against Egypt, the situation in the Gulf of Aqaba has become serious due to a series of naval and air force attacks by Israeli armed forces against Saudi Arabian territory and territorial waters.

The letter listed examples of Israeli armed forces violating Saudi Arabian territory.

The Saudi Arabian letter also pointed out that Israeli military aircraft have recently frequently violated Saudi Arabian airspace.

The letter also said that these unreasonable acts of aggression and provocation show that Israel disregards the recent resolutions passed by the United Nations on the Middle East issue, and clearly violates international law, and violates the obligations stipulated in the United Nations Charter. It must be pointed out that Saudi Arabia has the legitimate right to retaliate against this aggression, and it will continue to do so.

    沙特阿拉伯要求联合国注意以色列的挑衅活动
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社纽约16日讯：沙特阿拉伯驻联合国代表交给安全理事会主席和联合国秘书长一封信，要求联合国注意以色列武装部队在亚喀巴湾地区对沙特阿拉伯所进行的挑衅和武装侵略行为。
    沙特阿拉伯的信里说：自从对埃及的武装侵略开始以来，亚喀巴湾的局势就由于以色列武装部队对沙特阿拉伯本土和领海进行了一系列的海空军袭击而严重起来。
    信件列举了以色列武装部队侵犯沙特阿拉伯领土的事例。
    沙特阿拉伯的信里还指出：以色列军用飞机最近经常侵犯沙特阿拉伯领空。
    这封信还说，这种无理的侵略和挑衅行动表明，以色列漠视联合国最近就中东问题所通过的决议，而且显然违背国际法，违背联合国宪章所规定的义务。必须指出，沙特阿拉伯有合法权利来还击这种侵略行动，它将继续这样作。
