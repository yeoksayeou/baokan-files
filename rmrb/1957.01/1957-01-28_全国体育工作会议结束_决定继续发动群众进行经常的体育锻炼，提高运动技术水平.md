Xinhua News Agency report:
    The 1957 National Sports Work Conference, jointly convened by the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission and the Ministry of Education, concluded in Beijing on the 19th, lasting nine days. Attendees included the heads of sports commissions from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions; cadres responsible for sports work from various education departments and bureaus; representatives from various sports associations; and personnel from other relevant departments.
    In summarizing the sports work of 1956 and proposing the tasks for 1957, the conference requested that sports commissions in various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions should continue to mobilize the broad masses to engage in organized and regular physical exercise in 1957; through the concrete implementation of competition systems, athlete ranking systems, referee ranking systems, and the gradual establishment of various sports associations, to better promote the development of mass sports activities and improve athletic skill levels; to strengthen the work of cultivating cadres, to run the existing sports colleges, sports schools, and short-term training classes well, and to cultivate a large number of sports activists.
    The conference requested that sports commissions at all levels earnestly improve leadership and delve into practical matters; strengthen political and ideological education work among athletes, promote collectivism and patriotism, overcome individualism, championism, and poor sportsmanship; practice thrift, give full play to the utilization rate of existing venues, appropriately reduce the number of athletes and staff participating in sports meets according to actual conditions, and shorten the duration of sports meets. The conference advocated a spirit of thrift and simplicity in carrying out sports activities and opposed extravagance and waste.
    The conference focused on studying the problems of promoting the "Labor and Defense System," carrying out school sports activities, and establishing sports associations in 1956. By 1956, 21 national sports associations had been established in industrial and other systems across the country, along with more than 36,000 grassroots sports associations, with over 4.3 million members. Under the organization of the sports associations, more than 3 million people regularly participated in "Labor and Defense System" exercises in 1956, and more than 700,000 people reached the various levels of "Labor and Defense System" standards (excluding the military system), which was nine times that of 1955. However, the quality of work in the various grassroots sports associations still varies greatly. In institutions of higher learning, in the second half of 1956, due to the relaxation of leadership and necessary ideological education when implementing free participation in extracurricular activities and free disposal of leisure time, students' extracurricular exercise was greatly affected, and the number of participants dropped sharply. Therefore, the conference proposed that in 1957, physical education classes in schools should be well integrated with extracurricular sports activities, unified under the leadership of the school. Extracurricular sports activity time should, in principle, be set at twice a week, each time lasting 45 to 90 minutes. At present, the teaching syllabus for school physical education classes is based on the "Labor and Defense System." In the future, all schools that are able to teach according to the main textbooks in the physical education teaching syllabus should promote the "Labor and Defense System." However, extracurricular activities should be carried out according to the principle of combining voluntary participation with leadership and organized exercise.
    The conference required that all sports associations already established in various regions should be actively strengthened under leadership in 1957. Schools that have not yet established sports associations should determine whether to establish them or not based on the specific situation.
    The conference believed that in factories, mines, enterprises, and government offices this year, the focus should be on carrying out broadcast exercises and a variety of sports activities, and gradually carrying out "Labor and Defense System" exercises according to conditions. In rural areas, the main focus this year should be on carrying out simple, easy-to-implement sports activities that are popular with farmers, according to specific conditions.
    At this conference, the heads of sports commissions from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions believed that when carrying out mass sports work, close contact and cooperation should also be maintained with relevant units such as education and health departments, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League.

    全国体育工作会议结束
    决定继续发动群众进行经常的体育锻炼，提高运动技术水平
    新华社讯　历时九天的1957年全国体育工作会议19日在北京结束，这次会议是国家体育运动委员会和教育部联合召开的。出席的有各省、市、自治区体育运动委员会的负责人，各教育厅、局负责体育工作的干部，各体育协会的代表和其他有关部门的人员。
    这次会议在总结了1956年的体育工作、提出1957年的工作任务时，要求各省、市、自治区体育运动委员会在1957年应该继续发动广大群众进行有组织的经常的体育锻炼；通过竞赛制度、运动员等级制度、裁判员等级制度的具体实施和各项运动协会的逐步建立，更好地推动群众性体育运动的开展和提高运动技术水平；加强培养干部的工作，办好现有的体育学院、体育学校和短期训练班，大批地培养体育积极分子。
    会议要求各级体育运动委员会切实改进领导，深入实际；在运动员中加强政治思想教育工作，提倡集体主义、爱国主义思想，克服个人主义、锦标主义和不良的体育道德作风；厉行节约，充分发挥现有场地的使用率，根据实际情况适当地减少参加运动会的运动员和工作人员的人数，缩短运动会的时间。在开展体育活动中提倡节约和朴素的精神，反对铺张浪费。
    会议着重研究了1956年在推行“劳卫制”、开展学校体育活动、建立体育协会等方面的问题。到1956年为止，全国已经建立了产业系统和其他系统的全国性体育协会二十一个，基层体育协会三万六千多个，体育协会的会员有四百三十多万人。在体育协会的组织下，1956年有三百多万人经常参加“劳卫制”锻炼，有七十多万人达到了“劳卫制”各级标准（不包括部队系统），为1955年的九倍。但是，各基层体育协会工作的质量差别还很大。在高等学校里，1956年下半年由于在实行自由参加课外活动和自由支配课余时间的时候，放松了领导和必要的思想教育，致使学生的课外锻炼受到了很大的影响，参加锻炼的人数骤然下降。因此，会议提出：1957年学校中的体育课应当和课外体育活动很好地结合，统一由学校领导。课外体育活动时间，原则上规定每周两次，每次四十五分钟到九十分钟。目前，学校体育课的教学大纲是以“劳卫制”为基础来编订的。今后凡是能够按照体育教学大纲中主要教材进行教学的学校，都应该推行“劳卫制”。但是，课外活动应该根据自愿和有领导、有组织的锻炼相结合的原则进行。
    会议要求各地在1957年内，对一切已经建立的体育协会，都应该采取积极态度加强领导。对于那些还没建立体育协会的学校，应当根据具体情况确定建立或不建立。
    会议认为，在厂、矿、企业、机关中，今年应以开展广播体操和多种多样体育活动为主，根据条件逐步开展“劳卫制”锻炼；在农村中，今年主要是根据具体条件开展简单易行又为农民所喜爱的体育活动。
    在这次会议上，各省、市、自治区体育运动委员会的负责人认为，在开展群众性体育工作的时候，还应该同教育、卫生部门、中华全国总工会和青年团中央委员会等有关单位取得密切的联系和合作。
