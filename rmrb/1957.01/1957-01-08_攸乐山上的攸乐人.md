    In the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in the south of Yunnan Province, on the east bank of the Lancang River, there is a high mountain covering hundreds of miles called Youle Mountain, famous for its "Pu'er tea." The residents of the mountain are called the Youle people. Numbering only a little over five thousand, they are one of the smallest ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture.

    I recently visited this tea mountain and saw the Youle people building their new life with confidence.

    Legend has it that hundreds of years ago, the Youle people were driven from the fertile plains by other ethnic groups to this deep mountain. They cut through thorns and brambles, planted tea trees, hunted tigers and leopards, and cultivated the mountain land. The Youle men are all brave hunters. Children as young as a few years old can use slingshots to shoot down birds. When they grow up, they carry a long knife and a gunpowder gun, roaming the mountains and forests, starting their hunting life and protecting the crops in the mountains.

    However, during the years of reactionary rule, the Youle people suffered long-term oppression from alien ruling classes. Before the tea leaves were even picked or the grain harvested, countless exorbitant taxes and levies came. The ruling class also monopolized the tea market on the mountain, swindling eight pounds of tea from the Youle people for one pound of salt or even less. Tea gardens were abandoned, and many people even painfully cut down tea trees to plant rice. When they were driven to the brink of desperation, the Youle people repeatedly took up arms to fight the reactionary rulers. When I arrived at the largest village on the mountain, Manya Village, I met the famous hunter Manka A'si, who had led the Youle people in their struggle against the reactionaries.

    In May 1942, the Youle people, led by Manka A'si, fought against hundreds of soldiers sent by the puppet county magistrate. More than twenty of the thirty-six villages on the mountain were destroyed, granaries were burned, and pigs and cattle were looted. But the Youle people did not succumb. In the mountain ravines and thickets, they ambushed the enemy with hunting muskets and long knives, resisting stubbornly for three or four months. The reactionary army finally retreated from the mountain due to heavy casualties.

    Now, the tea gardens that have been barren for many years have gradually regained their former appearance, and green leaves have grown again on the branches of the old tea trees. Two years ago, the state-owned tea company sent a purchasing team to buy tea from the Youle people at reasonable prices. The People's Government also gave the farmers tea-rolling machines, iron pots for frying tea, knives and sickles needed for reclaiming tea gardens, and loans to farmers short of food to buy provisions. In 1954, the entire mountain only produced more than 20,000 catties of tea, but in 1956, it had increased to 52,000 catties. In Manya Village, one hundred and fifteen households were left with only two houses after being burned down in 1942. Now, they have rebuilt their homes. The granaries are full of newly harvested rice. Herds of pigs and cattle roam the village. Women sit on the bamboo balconies weaving cloth. Men are busy weaving straw mats and building new houses. Last year, ten families in this village demolished their old houses and moved into new homes. When the new houses were completed, the Youle people held the traditional "piaoniu" (cow-slaughtering) ceremony. All the men, women, and children in the village wore brightly colored clothes, singing ancient and simple Youle songs to celebrate the owner's happy life.

    Manka A'si is now a member of the Autonomous Prefecture's Political Consultative Conference and the deputy director of the preparatory committee for the Youle Mountain Production and Culture Station. He excitedly told me about the new things that have happened on Youle Mountain in recent years. In the past, the Youle people's production tools were only a machete and a palm-sized hoe. In the spring, they cut down miscellaneous trees and weeds on the hillside, dug a pit with a hoe, and scattered seeds. The harvest was naturally very low. The year before last, the People's Government bought耕牛（oxen） and iron plows and gave them to the Youle people. Several villages used cattle to plow the land for the first time. In the past, the Youle people used their feet to thresh rice, their soles worn bloody, and each person could not thresh even a hundred catties a day. Now they have begun to use threshing machines sent by the People's Government to thresh rice. In 1956, the first mutual aid group of the Youle people was established in Manya Village. Although natural disasters were serious that year, the mutual aid group still had a bumper harvest of grain and cash crops. The fifteen families in this mutual aid group were very poor in the past, but now only one family is short of food.

    Next to Manya Village, a new area of houses has been built, with a trade team, a bank, a clinic, and a primary school. It is gradually forming the economic and cultural center of the entire mountain. The Youle people did not have their own market, and before liberation, they had to endure the fraud and exploitation of unscrupulous merchants. A large amount of "zijing" (紫梗), an important industrial raw material produced on Youle Mountain, was only used to make knife handles in the past because no one bought it. Now the trade team purchases cotton, "zijing," hides, and bones at reasonable prices, and the store sells various commodities needed by the Youle people. The salesman Ai Kan told me that when he came to the mountain to set up the trade team in 1954, no one had ever used a quilt, and they had to sleep by the fire pit to keep warm at night. Now cotton blankets and cotton wadding have become bestsellers, and more than 300 cotton blankets were sold in the fourth quarter of last year alone. He pointed to the sneakers on the shelf and said that in the past, the Youle people, men, women, and children, were barefoot all year round, but now more and more people are buying shoes to wear.

    In the past, when the Youle people got sick, they could only pray to the gods and send away ghosts. Now they receive free medical treatment in the clinic. Medical personnel often carry medicine bags over mountains and ridges, traveling around all thirty-six villages to treat the Youle people.

    The Youle people, together with the Dai and other ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna, equally manage the affairs of the autonomous prefecture. In the People's Committee of the Autonomous Prefecture, there are Youle members and section chiefs, and some serve as vice chairmen of the Autonomous Prefecture's Political Consultative Conference. Of the thirty-five cadres working on Youle Mountain now, eighteen are Youle people.

    Of course, the backward conditions left over from history cannot be completely eliminated in the short term. The Youle people's current productivity is still very low, their lives are still very poor, and they do not have their own written language or intellectuals. The Party and government leading organs of the Autonomous Prefecture are actively helping the Youle people establish a production and cultural station recently, helping the Youle people develop production and improve their culture.

    攸乐山上的攸乐人
    新华社记者　黄昌禄
    在云南省南边的西双版纳傣族自治州境内，澜沧江的东岸，有一座方圆几百里的高山，叫攸乐山，山上出产着闻名世界的“普洱茶”。山上的居民叫攸乐人。他们一共只有五千多人，是自治州内人数最少的成员之一。
    记者最近访问了这座茶山，看见攸乐人正在满怀信心地建设自己的新生活。
    相传在几百年前，攸乐人被其他民族从肥沃膏腴的平坝赶到这座深山里来。他们披荆斩棘，种植茶树，猎取虎豹，经营山地。攸乐人的男子都是勇敢的猎手。几岁的小孩就能用弹弓打下飞鸟，成年后随身带一把长刀，背一支火药枪，出没在山林野草间，开始打猎生活，保护山地里的庄稼。
    但是在反动统治的岁月里，攸乐人长期受着异族统治阶级的压迫。每年茶叶还没有采下树，粮食没有收回家，说不清的苛捐杂税便来了。统治阶级还垄断了山上的茶叶市场，用一斤盐或更低的代价骗取攸乐人八斤茶叶。茶园荒芜了，许多人甚至忍痛把茶树砍了种植稻谷。当被逼得无路可走的时候，攸乐人曾经多次拿起武器向反动统治者斗争。记者这次来到山上最大的曼雅寨的时候，就会见了曾经领导攸乐人和反动派斗争的著名猎手曼卡阿四。
    1942年5月，攸乐人在曼卡阿四的率领下，同伪县长派来的几百名官兵作战。全山三十六座村寨就有二十多寨被毁，谷仓被烧尽，猪牛被抢光。但攸乐人没有屈服，他们在山箐里、树丛中，用打猎的火药枪和长刀四处伏击敌人，顽强抵抗了三四个月。反动军队终因死伤太多而退下山去。
    现在，荒芜多年的茶园已经逐步恢复了昔日的面貌，枯老的茶树枝头重新长出了绿叶。两年以前，国营茶叶公司就派来了。收购小组，用合理价格向攸乐人购买茶叶。人民政府还送给农民以揉茶机、炒茶的铁锅、垦复茶园需用的砍刀和镰刀，贷款给缺粮的农民购买口粮。1954年全山才产茶叶两万多斤，1956年已增加到五万二千斤。曼雅寨一百一十五户人家，1942年被烧得只剩下两间房子。现在，他们已经重建起自己的家园。谷仓中盛满刚收的稻谷。寨里走着成群的猪牛。妇女在竹楼的晒台上坐着织布。男人们忙着编草排，盖新房。这个寨子去年有十一家人拆了旧屋搬入新居。新房落成时，举行了攸乐人传统的“剽牛”仪式，全寨男女老幼都穿上鲜艳的衣衫，唱着古老纯朴的攸乐歌，庆贺主人的幸福生活。
    曼卡阿四现在是自治州的政协委员、攸乐山生产文化站筹委会的副主任，他兴奋地给我讲述了攸乐山这几年发生的新事情。过去攸乐人的生产工具只有一把砍刀和一把巴掌大的锄头，春天在山坡上砍去杂树乱草，用锄挖个坑，撒下种籽。收成自然很低。前年，人民政府买了耕牛和铁犁送给攸乐人，有几个村寨第一次用牛犁地了。以前，攸乐人收稻谷时都用脚踩，脚板磨出血了，每人一天还打不了百斤，现在已经开始用人民政府送的打谷机打谷了。曼雅寨在1956年还成立了攸乐人的第一个互助组，虽然这年自然灾害严重，互助组的粮食和经济作物还是丰收了。这个互助组的十五家人，过去都非常穷苦，现在只有一家人缺粮了。
    在曼雅寨旁边，新盖起一片房屋，设有贸易小组、银行、卫生所和小学校，这里正在逐渐形成全山经济文化的中心。攸乐人没有自己的市场，解放前只好忍受奸商的欺诈剥削。攸乐山大量出产的重要工业原料紫梗，过去因无人购买只好用来胶刀把。现在贸易小组用合理价格收购棉花、紫梗和兽皮、兽骨，门市部里摆着攸乐人需要的各种商品。售货员艾砍告诉我，1954年他到山上来设立贸易小组时，还没有人用过被子，晚上只好睡在火塘旁取暖。现在棉毯和棉絮已经成为畅销货，单去年第四季度就卖出棉毯三百多条。他指着货架上的球鞋说，从前攸乐人男女老幼就终年赤足，现在越来越多的人买鞋穿了。
    攸乐人过去生了病只有求神送鬼，现在他们在卫生所里得到免费医治。卫生人员经常背着药包翻山越岭，巡回全山三十六寨给攸乐人治病。
    攸乐人同傣族和西双版纳其他民族平等地共同管理着自治州的事务。在自治州人民委员会里，有攸乐人的委员和科长，还有的担任自治州政协的副主席。现在攸乐山工作的三十五个干部中，有十八个是攸乐人。
    当然，历史上遗留下来的落后状态还不能在短期内全部消除。攸乐人目前生产力还很低，生活还很贫苦，没有自己的文字和知识分子。自治州的党政领导机关正在积极帮助攸乐人在最近成立生产文化站，帮助攸乐人发展生产，提高文化。
