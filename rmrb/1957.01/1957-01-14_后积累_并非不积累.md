    “Post-Accumulation” is Not Non-Accumulation
    Hu Daoyuan
    Currently, most handicraft cooperatives are working on adjusting wages to ensure that 90% of their members can increase their labor income on the basis of production development. This is something deeply welcomed by the majority of members. Cooperatives that have correctly adjusted wages have seen a general increase in the production enthusiasm of their members. The Tieye (Ironware) Production Cooperative in Cheng Guan District, Su County, Anhui Province, previously had low wages, with most members earning less than before joining the cooperative. This led to low production enthusiasm among members and the withdrawal of twenty-nine people. After the wage adjustment, not only did no one ask to withdraw, but even those who had withdrawn wanted to return. It is clear that conscientiously doing a good job in adjusting wages is an important measure to consolidate and develop handicraft cooperatives.

    However, some grassroots cooperatives have adopted incorrect practices when adjusting wages. Some members have made excessively high demands on the cooperatives. The Yutian Tieye (Ironware) Production Cooperative in Suichuan County, Jiangxi Province, even took out all the cooperative's accumulated funds since 1952 to distribute. They came up with a plan to "retroactively pay wages" in installments, where members who joined in a particular year would receive "retroactive wage payments" from the accumulated funds of that year. The Kezi (Seal Carving) Cooperative in Hohhot, where the wage level was not low, with first-grade workers earning an average monthly wage of forty yuan and eighth-grade workers earning nearly one hundred yuan, some members were still demanding higher wages, even threatening to withdraw if they didn't earn one hundred yuan per month. This cooperative did not have much accumulation to begin with, and its equipment needed to be supplemented and improved. If the accumulated funds were reduced according to the demands of some members, it would be impossible to improve production. Some members in Wuhan believed that the more wages increased, the better, and the longer the period of retroactive payment, the better. For example, the No. 6 Hesha (Cotton Yarn) Cooperative in Qiaokou District, with six-hour workdays, set the highest monthly wage at 180 yuan and the lowest at 129 yuan during wage adjustment, and wanted to retroactively pay from October of last year. However, this cooperative only had over four thousand yuan in working capital, and the monthly surplus during the peak season was only over five hundred yuan (including labor dividends, welfare funds, taxes, etc.). Some cooperative cadres in Wuhan who expressed different opinions on the excessively high demands of members were opposed by some members.

    Why have these incorrect practices and inappropriate demands arisen? The main reason is a one-sided understanding of the principles of income distribution of "wages first, then treatment, then accumulation" and "to each according to his work, more pay for more work," mistakenly interpreting "post-accumulation" as no accumulation, thinking that distributing public accumulation meant implementing this principle. In particular, in recent months, after newspapers and periodicals in various regions criticized some cooperatives for unreasonable income distribution and excessive accumulation, which reduced the labor income of many members compared to before joining the cooperative, causing difficulties in family life and leading to some members demanding withdrawal, many grassroots cooperatives have developed a phenomenon of overcorrection.

    Of course, some cooperatives in the past one-sidedly emphasized accumulation, and although they had accumulated a lot, they did not resolve the issue of medical treatment for members for a long time, and some even delayed installing doors and windows in the collective dormitories of members, and some even stipulated that 15% of the wages due to members should be deducted each month as accumulation. These practices were all wrong. These comrades only saw the benefits of more accumulation for the cooperative, but forgot that the collective interests of the cooperative should be combined with the personal interests of the members, forgot that the increase in members' labor income is a major sign of the superiority of the cooperative, and forgot that production would not be improved and the cooperative would not be consolidated and developed if the welfare problems of members were not appropriately resolved. Therefore, it is completely correct for these cooperatives to pay attention to appropriately reducing the proportion of accumulation during wage adjustment in order to ensure that members increase their labor income and handle some urgently needed welfare undertakings.

    Here, another situation must be explained. Not all cooperatives have low wages and high accumulation. Many cooperatives do not have high accumulation, and the income of members is not only higher than before joining the cooperative, but also higher than the income of workers in state-owned enterprises; some cooperatives have higher accumulation than usual, but the income of members is also very high. If these cooperatives still emphasize reducing accumulation during wage adjustment, or even distributing all the accumulated funds of the past few years, then that is not right. We know that the accumulation of the cooperative is the wealth collectively owned by the members and the material foundation for the cooperative to improve equipment and develop production. Because of China's economic backwardness, the living standards of members of handicraft cooperatives, like those of other workers, are generally higher than before, but still very low compared to many advanced countries, and must continue to be improved in the future. However, the living standards of members can only be continuously improved on the basis of continuously expanding reproduction; it is not enough to rely solely on reducing accumulation. To continuously expand the scale of production, there must be a certain amount of accumulation. Therefore, when specifically implementing the principle of income distribution of "wages first, then treatment, then accumulation," whether to reduce the current accumulation ratio and by how much must be determined according to the specific situation of each cooperative. We must oppose the practice of only considering long-term interests and ignoring the current living difficulties of members, and we must also oppose the practice of only considering improving the current living standards of members and ignoring the long-term interests of members. That is, we oppose both one-sidedly increasing the proportion of accumulation and one-sidedly reducing the proportion of accumulation, especially opposing the practice of abolishing accumulation.

    “后积累”并非不积累
    胡道源
    目前，大部分地区的手工业合作组织，都在着手调整工资，争取在发展生产的基础上，使90％的社员能够增加劳动收入。这是一件深受广大社员欢迎的事。凡是已经正确地调整工资的合作社，社员的生产积极性普遍提高。安徽省宿县城关区铁业生产合作社，过去由于工资偏低，多数社员劳动收入低于入社以前，社员生产热情不高，并且有二十九人退社。工资调整以后，不仅再没有人要求退社，连退社的人都要求回社。可见认真做好调整工资工作，是巩固和发展手工业合作社的一个重要措施。
    但是，在调整工资的时候，有些基层社采取了不正确的做法。有些社员向合作社提出了过高的要求。江西省遂川县雩田铁业生产合作社，竟把社里从1952年以来的积累都拿出来分了。他们研究出一个分期“补发工资”的方案，哪一年入社的社员就可以从哪一年的积累中得到“补发工资”。呼和浩特市刻字合作社，工资水平并不算低，一级工每月平均工资有四十元，八级工每月平均工资接近一百元，有的社员还在要求提高工资，甚至提出每月赚不到一百元就要退社。这个社积累本来不多，设备也有待补充和改进，如果按某些社员的要求，再把积累降低，就会无法改进生产。武汉市有的社员认为工资增加得越多越好，补发的时间越长越好。如礄口区第六合纱社，每日工时六小时，调整工资的时候，订出每月最高工资达一百八十元，最低的一百二十九元，并且要从去年10月份起补发。但是这个社的流动资金只有四千多元，旺季每月盈余不过五百多元（包括劳动分红、福利基金、税收等）。武汉市有的社干部对社员过高的要求提出不同意见，就遭到某些社员的反对。
    为什么会产生这种错误的做法和不恰当的要求呢？主要的原因，是对“先工资，次治病，后积累”和“按劳取酬，多劳多得”的收益分配原则作片面的理解，错误地把“后积累”理解为不要积累，以为把公共积累分掉才算贯彻执行了这个原则。特别是最近几个月来，各地报刊批评了某些合作社收益分配得不合理，积累过多，使许多社员劳动收入比入社以前减少，家庭生活发生困难，引起部分社员要求退社以后，许多基层社又产生了矫枉过正的现象。
    当然，过去有些合作社片面强调积累，虽然已经有了不少积累，而对社员疾病医疗问题长期不给解决，有的连社员集体宿舍的门窗也迟迟不给安装，有的甚至规定每月从社员应得工资中提成15％作为积累，这些做法都是不对的。这些同志只看到积累多对社有好处，而忘掉了合作社的集体利益应当跟社员的个人利益相结合，忘掉了社员劳动收入增加是合作社优越性的一个主要标志，忘掉了社员生活福利问题得不到适当解决就不会搞好生产，也不会使社得到巩固和发展。因此，这些合作社在调整工资的时候，注意适当降低积累比重，以便保证社员增加劳动收入和办理一些急需的福利事业，这是完全正确的。
    在这里必须说明另一种情况，并不是所有的合作社都是工资偏低、积累偏高。有许多合作社的积累并不高，而社员收入不仅比入社以前有所增加，并且比国营企业工人的收入也高；有些合作社的积累虽然比一般的高，但是社员的收入也很高。这些合作社在调整工资的时候，如果仍然强调降低积累，甚至把几年来的积累分光，那就不对了。我们知道，合作社的积累，是社员集体所有的财富，是合作社改进设备、发展生产的物质基础。由于我国经济落后，手工业合作社社员的生活水平，也像其他工人的一样，一般说来虽然比以前提高了，但是比起许多先进国家来还是很低的，今后还必须不断地提高。但是，只有在不断地扩大再生产的基础上才能不断地提高社员的生活水平，光靠降低积累是不行的。要不断地扩大生产的规模，就必须有一定的积累。所以，在具体执行“先工资、次治病、后积累”的收益分配原则的时候，是不是降低现在的积累比例？降低多少？都必须根据每个社的具体情况来决定。我们既要反对那种只要长远利益而不顾社员现在生活疾苦的做法，也要反对那种只顾提高社员目前生活水平，而不顾社员长远利益的做法。这就是既反对片面提高积累比重，又反对片面降低积累比重，尤其反对取消积累的做法。
