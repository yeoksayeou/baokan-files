　　Both Official and Merchant, Abuse of Public Office for Private Gain
　　U.S. Defense Department Assistant Secretary Robert Tripp Ross "took leave of absence" on January 11th, because he is suspected of using his position for personal gain.
　　It is said that the suspicion is based on the fact that the Defense Department signed a contract worth $830,000 with the Wynne Company of New York in November of last year, and Ross's wife is the general manager of this company. The Defense Department also signed contracts with other companies related to Ross's wife and brother-in-law, with a total contract amount of $5.3 million.

    美国防部助理部长罗伯特·特里普·罗斯在11日“请假离职”，原因是他有利用职权进行私肥的嫌疑。
    据说，嫌疑的根据是，国防部在去年11月同纽约的温恩公司订了一个八十三万美元的合同，而罗斯的妻子就是这个公司的总经理。国防部还同和罗斯的妻子及舅子有关的其他公司订了合同，全部合同款项达五百三十万美元。
