Xinhua News Agency, January 8th: To address the weak technical capabilities of local industries, five factories in Beijing are pooling the resources of their technical personnel and experienced veteran workers to organize research associations.

The five local state-owned and joint public-private factories involved are the Beijing Scientific Instrument Factory, the United Instrument Factory, the Toy Factory, the Golden Star Pen Factory, and the Tongli Zipper Factory. Although they are of different types, their main processes all involve die stamping. In the past, due to the small number of technical personnel and their relatively low technical level, each factory had many technical problems in mold manufacturing that could not be solved, affecting production efficiency and preventing product quality from being improved significantly. The Beijing No. 1 Local Industry Bureau helped these five factories organize their technical personnel and veteran workers to form a technical research association, using methods such as regular meetings and mutual visits to jointly solve the production technical problems of each factory. For example, the punches used by the Golden Star Pen Factory to punch small holes in pen nibs were originally made of sewing needles, which were not durable. After joint research, they were changed to special steel wire quenched with potassium cyanide. As a result, the hardness of the needles was increased, the lifespan was extended nine times, and the small holes punched were also very smooth. The zippers produced by the Tongli Zipper Factory were originally difficult to pull and unsightly, and there were frequent returns. The technical research association helped the factory improve the punching machines and punches and other molds. Now, the zippers produced are not only neat and bright in appearance, but also smooth and easy to pull.

Some good experiences from each factory have also been promoted as a result. For example, the Toy Factory helped the Golden Star Pen Factory mill gears, and the Scientific Instrument Factory helped the Toy Factory manufacture a small shaft material. In the past, these things had to be sent to Shanghai for processing.

Currently, the technical research association has also established contact with the Iron and Steel Institute to seek their assistance in improving technical capabilities. The No. 1 Local Industry Bureau plans to expand this research association and promote this experience.

    北京五个工厂在技术上互通有无
    通过技术研究会积极提高产品质量
    据新华社8日讯　北京市有五个工厂集中技术人员和老技术工人的力量，组织研究会，解决地方工业技术力量薄弱的问题。
    北京市科学仪器厂、联合仪器厂、玩具厂、金星金笔厂、同利拉锁厂五个地方国营、公私合营工厂，虽然类型不同，但是主要工序都是模具冲压。过去各厂因为技术人员少，技术水平又不高，在模具制造上都有许多技术问题不能解决，影响生产效率和产品质量不能很好提高。北京市第一地方工业局帮助这五个厂把技术人员和老技术工人组织起来，成立了一个技术研究会，用定期开会，相互参观等方式，共同解决各厂的生产技术问题。比如，金星金笔厂冲笔尖上小孔用的冲头原来是缝衣针制成的，不耐用，经过共同研究，改用特种钢丝加氰化钾淬火制成，结果针头的硬度提高了，寿命延长了九倍，冲出来的小孔还很光滑。同利拉锁厂原来制出的拉锁不好拉，不好看，经常有退货，技术研究会帮助这个厂改进了冲床和冲头等模具，现在制出的拉锁不仅外观整齐光亮，拉起来还轻滑。
    各厂一些好的经验也因此得到推广。如玩具厂帮助金星金笔厂铣制齿轮，科学仪器厂帮助玩具厂制造一种小轴材料。这些东西过去都是要送到上海去加工的。
    目前技术研究会还和钢铁学院取得联系，请他们帮助提高技术水平。第一地方工业局准备扩大这个研究会，并且推广这个经验。
