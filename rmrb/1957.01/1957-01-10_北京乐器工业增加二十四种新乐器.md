Xinhua News Agency, January 9th: The Beijing musical instrument industry added twenty-four new instruments last year.

    In the past, the upright pianos produced in our country only had eighty-five keys. The Beijing Musical Instrument Factory has now produced eighty-eight-key pianos. Many music-loving children often find the size of violins unsuitable. The Beijing Musical Instrument Factory has made three different sizes of violins for children according to the length of their arms and fingers.

    This factory has produced various special styles of organs. For example, the folding organ can be folded into a box, making it very easy to carry; there is also one that looks like an office desk, which can be used as an office desk, but when the middle drawer is opened, it becomes an organ. Woodwind instruments are difficult to make, and the Yihua Musical Instrument Factory successfully trial-produced three types of complex, beautiful-sounding clarinets last year. The six-stringed zither and xylophone made by the National Musical Instrument Factory were shipped to the border areas and were very popular.

    Beijing's musical instrument industry has developed from the repair industry. The orchestral instruments now produced can equip a full orchestra with all the instruments it needs, which has begun to change the situation of relying entirely on imported instruments. Domestically produced pianos and organs have also been exported.

    北京乐器工业增加二十四种新乐器
    据新华社9日讯　北京市乐器工业去年一年增加了二十四种新乐器。
    过去我国生产的立式钢琴只有八十五键，北京市乐器厂现在已经制成了八十八键的。许多喜好音乐的小朋友们往往嫌小提琴体积不合适。北京市乐器厂按照不同年龄儿童手臂和手指的长度，为他们制成了三种不同尺寸的儿童用的小提琴。
    这个工厂制出了各种特殊样式的风琴。例如，折叠式风琴可以折成一个箱子，携带很方便；还有一种看起来像一个办公桌，可以当办公桌用，可是打开当中抽屉就成了一架风琴。木管乐器是很难做的一种乐器，艺华乐器厂去年试制成功了三种构造复杂、音色优美的单簧管。民族乐器厂制成的六弦琴和铁琴运到了边疆，很受欢迎。
    北京市乐器工业是从修理行业发展起来的，现在生产的管弦乐器已能配齐一个管弦乐队所需要的全套乐器，这就开始改变了全部用进口乐器的状况。国产的钢琴、风琴并且已经出口。
