Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 4th: The Soviet and German Democratic Republic government delegations began talks on January 4th in the Kremlin.

Xinhua News Agency, January 4th: According to TASS, when the head of the German Democratic Republic government delegation, Grotewohl, arrived in Moscow on January 3rd, he said at the station that our two governments are starting friendly negotiations at the beginning of the new year in order to successfully safeguard peace in the future and further promote socialist construction.

Recently, the war instigators of the imperialist countries are wishfully hoping for a split in our socialist camp. This hope is completely unfounded. With unparalleled strength and sincere conviction, we say to all those who doubt this point: our friendship and fraternal cooperation are solid, unbreakable, and cannot be destroyed by any conspiracy. The foundation of this friendship and cooperation is the unwavering consistency of our interests and goals, and the principles of internationalism, equality, and mutual respect. The friendly alliance of peace-loving socialist countries is the most effective force against all provocations by imperialists, and we will jointly repulse such provocations in the future.

Our negotiations will also help achieve these goals. Our negotiations will strengthen our friendly relations, make the fraternal cooperation between our two countries more fruitful, and strengthen the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. This is the wish of our delegation.
