Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, January 7th - The Romanian newspapers on January 6th published the resolutions of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party held from December 27th to 29th, 1956.

The resolution pointed out that the Romanian national economy had made many achievements in 1956, which gradually improved the living standards of the working people. The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party decided that in the future, on the one hand, it will tirelessly continue to implement the policy of national socialist industrialization and the development of heavy industry—to build the foundation of socialism and socialist expanded reproduction—and on the other hand, it will pay attention to the task of constantly vigorously developing agriculture and consumer goods industries.

The plenary session decided to improve the current wage system in 1957. After the wage system is improved, the average wage will increase by 15%, and the wages of low-wage workers will increase even more. In 1957, due to the reform of the wage system, the increase in state-issued children's allowances, and the increase in low-level preferential pensions, employees will receive an additional benefit of 2.5 billion lei (Romanian currency).

The plenary session believes that in order to stimulate the development of agricultural production more forcefully than at present, it is necessary to abolish the system of establishing central reserves by implementing compulsory sales of most agricultural products, and replace it with a system of ordering and purchasing.

When talking about the draft national plan for 1957, the plenary session believed that, based on the experience of the first year (1956) of the second five-year plan, it is necessary to reduce certain investments stipulated in the instructions of the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party regarding the second five-year plan and delay the construction of certain projects. It is necessary to change the investment ratio of various sectors of the national economy and change the ratio of funds used for accumulation and consumption in order to adapt to the growing material and cultural needs of the working people.

The Central Committee believes that the draft national plan for 1957 meets the needs of the country's economic and cultural development. In 1957, investment will ensure the priority of heavy industry based on resources and economic possibilities, and also ensure the constant and vigorous development of agricultural production, the food industry, and the light industry.

The resolution said that in order to develop the material and technical base of agricultural production, the production of agricultural machinery should be doubled compared to 1956. More funds will be allocated to implement agricultural mechanization and water and soil improvement work. The production of mineral fertilizers will also be greatly increased.

In order to better supply urban and rural residents with commodities, the total commodity circulation of socialist trade will increase by approximately 4 billion lei compared to 1946. More than 1 billion lei will be allocated from central and local funds for the construction and repair of housing.

The plenary session believes that overcoming the phenomenon that agriculture lags behind the development of industry and behind the growth of economic needs and residents' needs is the central economic task of the Party, the people's democratic government, and the working people. Developing the production of major grains (corn and wheat) is a decisive condition for improving all sectors of agricultural production, especially animal husbandry. By 1960, the planting area of corn must reach 4 million hectares, and the planting area of wheat and rye must reach 3.5 million hectares.

The resolution then pointed out that during the second five-year plan, the socialist component in agriculture will greatly increase its role in increasing the production of marketable agricultural products and establishing national reserves. State-owned farms should become the largest grain producers in the next few years. Special attention should be paid to carrying out some organizational work to economically strengthen collective farms, production cooperatives, and agricultural mutual aid groups, expand them by absorbing new members, establish new cooperatives, and comprehensively develop cooperatives. The resolution also specifically pointed out that in order to implement the resolutions of the plenary session, the entire Party should make more efforts to improve organizational and political work among the masses and give play to the creative initiative of the masses.

The resolution also talked about the specific tasks of Party organizations, trade unions, and people's congresses.

    罗马尼亚工人党中央全会
    对经济发展问题作出重要决定
    今后将一方面继续执行社会主义工业化和发展重工业的政策；另一方面大力发展农业和消费品工业。改进现行工资制度，增加工资。废除对农产品的义务交售办法。克服农业的落后现象是目前的中心经济任务。
    新华社布加勒斯特7日电　1月6日，罗马尼亚各报刊载了罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会1956年12月27日到29日举行的全体会议的决议。
    决议指出，1956年罗马尼亚国民经济取得了很多成就，这使得劳动人民生活水平逐步提高。罗马尼亚工人党中央全会决定，今后将一方面不倦地继续执行国家社会主义工业化和发展重工业——建成社会主义和社会主义扩大再生产的基础——的政策，另一方面将重视经常大力发展农业和消费品工业的任务。
    全会决定在1957年改进现行的工资制度。改进工资制度后，平均工资将增加15％，而低工资工人的工资将增加得更多。1957年，由于工资制度的改革、国家发给儿童补助金的增加以及低额优抚金的增加，职工获得的额外好处共达二十五亿列伊（罗币）。
    全会认为，为了比目前更加有力地刺激农业生产的发展，必须废除通过对大部分农产品实行义务交售办法来建立中央储备的制度，而代之以定购和收购制度。
    在谈到1957年国家计划草案的时候，全会认为，根据第二个五年计划第一年（1956年）的经验，有必要削减罗马尼亚工人党第二次代表大会关于第二个五年计划指示中规定的某些投资和延缓某些工程项目的建设，有必要改变国民经济各部门的投资比例和改变用于积累和用于消费的资金的比例，以便适应劳动人民日益增长的物质和文化需求。
    党中央认为1957年度国家计划草案是符合国家的经济发展和文化发展的需要的。1957年度的投资，一方面根据资源和经济可能性保证重工业优先地位，另一方面也要保证经常地大力地发展农业生产、食品工业和轻工业的生产。
    决议说，为了发展农业生产的物质和技术基础，农业机器的生产量应比1956年增加二倍。将拨出更多的资金来实行农业机械化和水利土壤改良工作。矿质肥料的生产也将要大大增加。
    为了更好地供应城乡居民以商品，社会主义贸易的商品流通总额将比1946年增加约四十亿列伊。将从中央资金和地方资金中拨出十亿多列伊来用于建造和修理住宅。
    全会认为，克服农业落后于工业的发展和落后于经济需要和居民需要的增长的现象，是党、人民民主政府和劳动人民的中心经济任务。发展主要谷物（玉蜀黍和小麦）的生产是提高农业生产的各个部门、特别是畜牧业的决定性条件。到1960年必须使玉蜀黍的播种面积达到四百万公顷，使小麦和黑麦的播种面积达到三百五十万公顷。
    决议接着指出，在第二个五年计划期间，农业中的社会主义成分在增加商品农产品的生产和建立国家储备方面的作用会大大提高。国营农场在近几年内应成为最大的谷物生产者。应该特别注意进行一些组织工作，从经济上来加强集体农庄、生产合作社和农业互助组，用吸收新社员的方法来扩大它们，建立新的合作社和全面发展合作社。决议还特别指出，为执行全体会议的决议，全党应该多多努力改进对群众的组织工作和政治工作，发挥群众的创造积极性。
    决议还谈到党组织、工会、人民会议的具体任务。
