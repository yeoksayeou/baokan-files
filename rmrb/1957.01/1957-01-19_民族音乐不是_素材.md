		Folk Music is Not "Material"
		Sha Mei
		Some comrades used to take a negative attitude towards Chinese folk music. Now, faced with the facts, although they cannot but acknowledge it, their acknowledgement has not reached the proper level. For example, people often say, "Yes, we should learn from folk music. Folk music is indeed good material and can be used as a basis for creation."

		To regard Chinese folk music as mere material is to treat it too harshly. Is it reasonable to say that China originally had no houses, only wood, bricks, and tiles? In fact, China not only has houses, but the houses in the east, west, north, and south are all different, especially the pavilions and towers, which are unique to China! They were created by ourselves, not built using foreign designs.

		Chinese folk music, no matter how you look at it, is not just material. Even the most popular folk song like "Meng Jiangnu" possesses a complete form and a unified structure. At the very least, its introduction, development, climax, and conclusion are very clear. In particular, each piece has its own expression of content and emotion. How can we say it is material? It is clearly complete music, but it's uniquely Chinese music!

		Chinese folk music not only has its own unique complete forms, but also resembles some Western song forms. For example, the "Lazy Eyebrow" in Gaoqiang is a mixed ternary form (i.e., A+B+A+C+B+coda); the "New Water Order" aria is a ternary form (A+B+C); and the "Erlangshen" is a binary form (i.e., A+B). But this does not mean that it is Western music, because its appearance, spirit, and interest are all Chinese. Just like some stone-walled houses built against the mountains in southwestern China, they may appear somewhat Western in appearance from a distance, but their internal and structural forms are not at all like Western ones. Conversely, in some Western films, we often see old-fashioned thatched cottages in the countryside, which also look a bit like Chinese farmhouses. I think if I go inside to see, they must be different.

		In particular, some components in Western music, such as modulation, major and minor scales, long-distance intervals, unusual time signatures such as 5/4, triplets, etc., also exist in Chinese folk music. For example, the "Six Guards Palace Lyrics" of Gaoqiang is an aria that modulates six times in a row. "Dian Jiang Chun," "Yizhihua," "Duan Zheng Hao," and "Mian Da Xu" are arias in minor scales. The jump of an eleventh interval is found in "Qingluan Ao," and the 5/4 time signature is found in the Sichuan opera Erhuang board. However, when Western music adopts it, it becomes Western style, and when China adopts it, it becomes Chinese style, each with its own merits. Don't underestimate yourself.

		We should learn some advanced technologies from the West, but we must digest them, and only by being familiar with Chinese things can we digest advanced Western technologies. At the same time, some unique works of Chinese music are also models for us to learn from. As far as our talents are concerned, it cannot be said that there is no advanced technology to learn from. Otherwise, why are many good things from our predecessors not as good as theirs when we write them?

### 民族音乐不是“素材”

    民族音乐不是“素材”
    沙梅
    有些同志，过去对中国民族音乐的确是采取否定的态度，现在呢，在事实的面前，虽然不能不予以承认，但承认尚未达到应有的程度。比如说，常有人这样说：“是的，我们应该向民间音乐学习，民族音乐的确是很好的素材，大可以拿来作创作的根据。”
    把中国民族音乐当作素材看，这未免太苛待它了。如果说中国原来没有房子，有的只是些木料和砖瓦；这话通么？事实上中国不但有房子而且东西南北的房子还各有不同，尤其还有楼台亭阁，不过这是中国特有式的房子而已！是自己创造的，不是拿外国图样来盖的。
    中国的民族音乐无论怎样说也不是素材。即如像孟姜女那样最流行的一首民歌都具备了完整形式与统一的结构。至少它的起承转合是非常明确的。尤其每首曲子都有它内容与情绪的表达，怎能说它是素材呢？明明是完整的音乐，不过是中国独有的中国式音乐而已！
    中国的民族音乐不但有它独有的各种完整形式，而且也有些像西洋的某些曲体。比如高腔中的“懒画眉”系混合三段体（即A＋B＋A＋C＋B＋尾声）；“新水令”曲牌系三段体（A＋B＋C）；“二郎神”系两段体（即A＋B）。但这不等于它是西洋曲体的音乐，因为它的面貌、精神、趣味都是中国的。正如中国西南部倚山建筑的某些石墙房子，远远望去在外貌上似乎有点近于西洋式，但它的内部与结构的形式一点也不像西洋的。反之，从西洋的一些影片中，常常看到些农村的老式草屋，也有些像中国的农舍，我想进去看，一定也不相同的。
    尤其西洋音乐中某些构成部分，如转调，大小音阶，音程的远距离，不一般的拍子如5／4，三连音符等等，在中国民族音乐中也有的，如高腔的“六卫宫词”系一连转调六次的曲牌。“点绛唇”，“一枝花”，“端正好”，“棉搭絮”等是小音阶的曲牌。跳十一度音程有“青鸾袄”，5／4拍有川剧二簧板。不过，西洋音乐采用了它变成西洋式，中国采用了它变为中国式，各有千秋，不要妄自菲薄。
    西洋的某些先进技术，我们应向它学习，但须消化，而且只有熟悉了中国的东西才能消化西洋的先进技术。同时，中国音乐的某些独特作品，也是我们学习的典范。对我们的才能来说，其中也不能说毫无先进技术可取，否则，前人的许多好东西，为甚么我们写出没有他们那末好？
