Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 6th. More than seventy kinds of name-brand underwear, yarn, and socks in Shanghai will resume using the factories' dedicated trademarks starting this year, allowing consumers to choose these goods according to their preferences.

The various Shanghai yarns that were once commonly known as "China Department Store Brand" will, starting in January, first resume supplying seven brands including Queen, Globe, White Horse, and Xiao Nan. The familiar Goose, Chrysanthemum, Three Guns, and Monk Cap brands of undershirts have already been produced and will resume supply this summer. The hosiery industry department has decided to first restore more than fifty dedicated brands, such as White Cat, Little Daughter, Emerald Horse, and Golden Arrow.

The old brands of products such as undershirts, vests, and yarn were canceled after the products were processed and sold exclusively by state-owned commercial departments with unified materials and unified specifications in 1954. Although this facilitated the commercial department's arrangements for production and distribution of goods, consumers could not buy the goods they were familiar with and liked, and felt inconvenienced. Factories also no longer cared about the quality of their products because they had no dedicated trademarks. Some old name-brand goods gradually lost the characteristics of their original products after unified trademarks, unified materials, and specifications.

As the factories' dedicated brands are restored, the characteristics of various products will also be gradually restored.

    消费者又可以买到自己喜爱的商品了
    上海恢复供应七十多种名牌纺织品
    新华社上海6日电　上海有七十多种名牌内衣、绒线和袜子，今年开始恢复各厂专用商标，消费者又可以根据自己的爱好选购这些商品了。
    一度通称为“中百牌”的上海各种绒线，1月份起，首先恢复供应皇后牌、地球牌、白马牌、小囡牌等七种。人们熟悉的鹅牌、菊花牌、三枪牌、僧帽牌等十一种名牌汗衫，现在已经生产出来，今年夏天恢复供应。制袜工业部门决定先恢复白猫、小千金、翠马、金箭等五十多种专用牌号。
    汗衫、背心和绒线等产品的老牌号，都是在1954年产品由国营商业部门加工包销和统一用料、统一规格以后取消的。这样，对商业部门安排生产、分配货源虽然便利了，消费者却因此买不到自己熟悉喜爱的商品，感觉不便。工厂也因无专用商标，不再关心自己的产品质量。有些老名牌货，在统一商标，统一用料和规格以后，逐渐丧失了原有产品的特长。
    随着工厂产品的专用牌号恢复，各种产品的特长也要逐步恢复。
