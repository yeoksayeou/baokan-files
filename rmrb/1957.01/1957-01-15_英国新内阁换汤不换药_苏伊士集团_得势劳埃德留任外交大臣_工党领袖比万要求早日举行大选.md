Xinhua News Agency, London, January 14th. British Prime Minister Macmillan, after meeting with the Queen on the evening of the 13th, announced the list of the new cabinet. The members of the new cabinet include: Butler as Home Secretary and Lord Privy Seal, Lloyd as Foreign Secretary, Thorneycroft as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Duncan Sandys as Minister of Defence, etc.

The list of the new cabinet contains the following main facts:

First, Lloyd, who had very close ties to Eden's Suez adventure, continues to serve as Foreign Secretary. It is generally believed that this indicates that the government's Suez policy will not undergo fundamental changes.

Second, Butler serves as Home Secretary, while also holding the original positions of Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Commons. Butler, who competed with Macmillan for the position of Prime Minister after Eden's resignation, said in the "Sunday Express" on the 13th: "It would be foolish to say that I am not disappointed with the Queen's decision." He also said: "If it were not so, I would be insensitive." But he said he would support and help Macmillan.

Third, some members of the previous government have been promoted. Forty-seven-year-old Thorneycroft has been promoted from President of the Board of Trade to Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is a very important position. Sandys has been promoted from Minister of Housing and Local Government to Minister of Defence.

Fourth, a new ministry has been established - the Ministry of Power, headed by the newcomer Sir Percy Mills as Minister, in charge of all power resources, especially atomic energy production. Mills is not a member of parliament. He is an important figure in large enterprises, a spokesman for the British National Chamber of Commerce, former chairman of the National Federation of Machine Tool Trades Associations, and chairman of W. & T. Avery, Ltd. His new ministry will also take over responsibility for the steel industry from the Board of Trade.

Fifth, five other newcomers have joined the new cabinet, including Henry Brooke. Brooke, formerly Financial Secretary to the Treasury, has now been appointed Minister of Housing and Local Government.

Sixth, some former ministers have been excluded, including former Minister of Defence Anthony Head and other "moderate" members of the former cabinet. The Suez Group has always accused Head of lacking resolve and preparation in the Suez War.

Three of the excluded ministers were granted peerages today. These three are former Paymaster General Sir Walter Monckton, former Home Secretary and Minister for Welsh Affairs Major Gwilym Lloyd George, and former Minister of Works Buchan-Hepburn. This means that three by-elections will be held.

The new cabinet has a total of eighteen members, while Eden's cabinet had nineteen.

Xinhua News Agency, January 14th. London dispatch: British Labour Party left-wing leader Bevan demanded an early general election in the "News of the World" on the 13th. He wrote: Eden's replacement by Macmillan as British Prime Minister is just "a game of musical chairs." Eden could not continue in office because his policies had failed. And "the new government we are facing is mainly composed of old figures who are guilty of the same sins." Bevan asked: "What reason is there to hope that our country will have a better chance of recovery under the leadership of Mr. Macmillan than if, for example, Sir Eden were still in office?"

    英国新内阁换汤不换药
    “苏伊士集团”得势劳埃德留任外交大臣
    工党领袖比万要求早日举行大选
    新华社伦敦14日电　英国新首相麦克米伦13日晚上在晋见女王以后，宣布了新内阁的名单。新内阁成员包括：内政大臣兼掌玺大臣巴特勒，外交大臣劳埃德，财政大臣桑尼克罗夫特，国防大臣邓肯·桑迪斯等。
    新内阁的名单中包含下列主要事实：
    第一，和艾登的苏伊士冒险有非常密切联系的劳埃德，继续留任外交大臣。这里普遍认为，这表明政府的苏伊士政策不会有基本的改变。
    第二，巴特勒任内政大臣，同时兼任原先的掌玺大臣和下院领袖的职位。在艾登辞职后同麦克米伦一起竞争首相职位的巴特勒13日在“星期日快报”上说：“如果硬说我对女王的决定不感到失望，那是愚蠢的。”他又说：“假如不是这样的话，我就是不通人情了。”但是他说，他将支持和帮助麦克米伦。
    第三，前政府的一些成员被提升了。四十七岁的桑尼克罗夫特由贸易大臣改任财政大臣。财政大臣是一个很重要的职位。桑迪斯由住房和地方政府大臣改任国防大臣。
    第四，设立了一个新的部——动力部，由新人佩西·米尔斯爵士任大臣，掌管一切动力资源，特别是原子能生产。米尔斯不是议员。他是大企业的一个重要人物，是英国全国总商会的发言人、机器制造业和协作行业企业主全国联合会的前主席和伯明翰磅秤机器制造公司董事长。他的新部也将从贸易部接管关于钢铁工业的责任。
    第五，另有五个新人参加了新内阁，其中包括亨利·布鲁克。布鲁克以前是财务次官，这次被任命为住房和地方政府大臣。
    第六，有一些前大臣被排除出去，其中有前任国防大臣安东尼·赫德和前内阁中别的“温和派”分子。苏伊士集团一向指责赫德在苏伊士战争中缺乏决心和准备。
    在被排除的大臣中有三个人今天被授予贵族爵位。这三个人就是前会计大臣华尔特·蒙克顿爵士，前内政大臣兼威尔士事务大臣劳埃德—乔治少校和前工务大臣巴肯—赫伯恩。这也就是说，要举行三次下议员补缺选举。
    新内阁阁员共有十八名，而艾登内阁中却有十九名。
    新华社14日讯　伦敦消息：英国工党左翼领袖比万13日在“世界新闻报”上要求早日举行大选。他写道：英国首相的位置由艾登让给麦克米伦只是“按照音乐的节拍换椅子的玩意儿”。艾登之所以不能继续执政是因为他的政策已经破产。而“我们所面对着的新政府主要地仍然是由旧人物组成的，他们犯有同样的罪过。”比万问道：“有什么理由来希望，我们的国家在麦克米伦先生的领导下会比在譬如说艾登爵士仍任原职的情况下有较好的复原机会呢？”
