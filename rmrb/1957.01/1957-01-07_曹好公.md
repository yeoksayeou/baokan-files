	"Good Public Servant Cao"

	*A Night Traveler in Wind and Rain*

	On the night of December 7th, the cold wind grew stronger with each gust, and slanting raindrops silently fell on the pitch-black fields. A person with a burlap sack over their head hurried along the narrow ridges, clutching a flashlight. This was Cao Huibin, the director of the Heping Agricultural Cooperative and a Communist Party member. On this day, the leaders of each production team and many members had gone to the town to hand in public grain and sell surplus grain and had not yet returned. Cao Huibin was worried about the rice left in the fields and rushed to seven teams to urge everyone to hurry and gather it. He helped those production teams where only women and children were left at home to bring the rice from the fields into the houses before he felt relieved enough to go to sleep.

	The summer of 1956 was rainy, and typhoons struck the cooperative several times. Cao Huibin often received urgent notices from the township about rain conditions and approaching typhoons late at night. Each time, he immediately went to each production team without hesitation to tell everyone to take precautions early. When harvesting barley, Cao Huibin went to each team for the first time to report the news of wind and rain, urging everyone to rush the harvest. Many members did not believe him. The seventy-year-old farmer, Tu Fengshan, said with a chuckle, "Good Director, how can you know everything? Did the Heavenly Father tell you?" Cao Huibin said, "The Heavenly Father doesn't care about our affairs, the weather station told us." As he spoke, he began to help everyone carry the wheat, leading everyone to rush the harvest and avoid losses.

	This year, the cooperative achieved an all-around bumper harvest of wheat, rice, and cotton. 90% of the members increased their income. When talking about the bumper harvest of 1956, the members all affectionately mentioned how their director worked hard, braving wind and rain.

	*Our Good Public Servant Cao*

	The Heping Agricultural Cooperative is in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province. When I visited this cooperative, the members, when mentioning the cooperative director Cao Huibin, all said: Our Good Public Servant Cao truly deserves to be a good cadre educated by the Communist Party.

	At the home of female member Wang A'ping, she told me that if it hadn't been for Good Public Servant Cao, she wouldn't be alive today. It turned out that Wang A'ping had a miscarriage in March of last year, and her stomach ached all night, with a lot of bleeding. Her husband was so worried that he cried, but he had no money and nowhere to find a doctor. At dawn, a kind neighbor ran to find Director Cao to find a solution. As soon as Cao Huibin heard this, he hurried to the township government to make a phone call. In less than an hour, a doctor from the district health center arrived on a bicycle, giving injections and rescuing her, and after half a day of work, the bleeding finally stopped. Wang A'ping's husband pointed to the three boys beside him and said to me, "If the children's mother had any misfortune, our family would be miserable."

	Cao Huibin often visits the poor households and "five guarantee" households in the cooperative, helping them solve their difficulties at any time. Last spring, new member Chen Yongxing ran out of food. At that time, the cooperative also had no money. Cao Huibin went back and discussed it with his mother, taking out more than fifty catties of rice from his own home to help Chen Yongxing get through the spring famine. When the elderly, widowed, and childless people saw Director Cao coming, they were even more like seeing a relative. Some said that no one would grind their wheat, some said that the roof was leaking a little, and some said that they felt bored sitting all day and wanted to do some light work. Cao Huibin promptly told the team leaders about their requests, and the teams always took care of these people properly.

	In August, a typhoon damaged more than two hundred thatched houses in the Heping Cooperative. Cao Huibin is the secretary of the Party branch in the cooperative. At the branch meeting, he mobilized the Communist Party members to care about the suffering of the masses and help the members repair their houses. Those with more spacious housing should lend it to the masses for temporary residence. The cooperative allocated 20,000 catties of straw to help the members. In less than half a month, under the leadership of the Communist Party members, everyone worked together, and all the houses were repaired.

	The many things people told me made me understand how much love and respect the title "Good Public Servant" contains!

	*Go and Consult with the Masses*

	Last summer harvest, there was particularly much rain. How to safely harvest the more than one thousand acres of wheat that were growing with full ears was a big problem. Cao Huibin believed that this was the first test for the advanced cooperative. At that time, there was a general passive mood among the members of "waiting for the weather to clear." After Cao Huibin and other cooperative cadres studied the matter, they decided to go and consult with the masses separately. Cao Huibin went to ask several old farmers for advice, and the experienced old farmers offered many good suggestions. He also calculated an account with the members: if each mu yielded ten catties less, the cooperative would yield sixteen thousand catties less of wheat. Waiting for the weather to clear before harvesting would result in even greater losses. With this calculation, everyone became anxious and said they could no longer wait. The cooperative pooled the farmers' experience and decided to drain ditches and rush to harvest at the same time, distributing the harvest as it was gathered, and increasing temporary warehouses in each production team to solve the problem of insufficient warehouses. The members acted actively and in an orderly manner, completing the rush harvest in three and a half days, shortening the time by half compared to the original estimate, and achieving an unprecedented bumper summer harvest: the average yield of naked barley was 357 catties per mu, and the average yield of wheat was 226 catties per mu.

	Cao Huibin and the cooperative's main cadres are also good at listening to the masses' negative opinions and often change their original plans after accepting these opinions. Cao Huibin said: The opinions of the masses are always more thorough than what a few people can think of.

	*The More We Work, the More Energetic We Become*

	In the spring of 1956, when the Fourth Production Team had just been merged into the Heping Cooperative from another village, the members, based on their past poor production performance, all said that this team was "hopelessly backward" and worried that it would affect the entire cooperative.

	Cao Huibin felt that this view was incorrect and went to the team to gain an in-depth understanding. It turned out that the team was mainly suffering from "poverty." The twenty-six households had only two cows and no boats, and most of the members lived in poverty. Team leader Wang Ruisheng also had a difficult life and was worried that he would lose face in front of everyone if production did not go well. After Cao Huibin raised these issues for discussion at the management committee, the cooperative first began to solve the team's livelihood problems, issuing living loans to eighteen households. The cooperative also allocated cattle, horses, agricultural boats, farm tools, and fertilizer to support the team. The cooperative cadres strengthened political work in the team, increased the masses' awareness, and also paid attention to cultivating a group of activists. As a result, the team changed day by day, and the members became more and more energetic in production. The yield of the farmland cultivated by the team increased significantly compared to 1955.

	Cao Huibin often said to the cooperative cadres: Being able to understand the thoughts of the masses, understand their suffering, and help them solve their difficulties, and then explaining principles and policies to them, they will be able to listen, the masses can be mobilized, and the work can be done well.

	Cao Huibin himself is doing work in this way.

### “曹好公”

    “曹好公”
    新华社记者　顾平
    风雨夜行人
    12月7日夜晚，寒风一阵比一阵紧，倾斜的雨丝无声地落在漆黑一片的田野里。一个顶着麻袋的人，手里捏着电筒匆忙地走在狭窄的田埂上。这是和平农业社的主任、共产党员曹惠宾。这一天，各生产小队的队长和很多社员到镇上去缴公粮卖余粮还没有回来。曹惠宾担心留在场上的稻谷，跑了七个小队督促大家赶快收拾。他帮助那些只剩下妇女和小孩在家的生产队，把场上的稻谷收到屋里去以后，才安心地回去睡觉。
    1956年夏季多雨，台风几次侵袭这个合作社。曹惠宾经常在深夜接到乡里送来雨情和台风过境的紧急通知。每次，他都是从不迟疑地马上到各生产队关照大家及早预防。收割元麦的时候，曹惠宾第一次到各小队报告风雨的消息，催大家赶快抢收。很多社员不信他。七十岁老农民屠凤山笑呵呵地说：“好主任，你哪能样样晓得，莫非是天老爷告诉你的？”曹惠宾说：“天老爷不和我们讲交情，这是气象台告诉我们的。”说着他就动手帮大家挑麦，带领大家抢收，避免了损失。
    这一年，这个社的麦子、水稻和棉花获得全面丰收。90％的社员增加了收入。谈起1956年的丰收，社员们都要亲切地提到他们的主任是怎样顶风冒雨辛劳奔波的。
    我们的曹好公
    和平农业社在江苏省太仓县。我在这个社访问的时候，社员们一提到社主任曹惠宾，都说：我们的曹好公真不愧是共产党教育出来的好干部。
    在女社员王阿平家里，她告诉我说：要不是曹好公，她就活不到今天。原来王阿平在去年3月里流产了，肚子疼了一夜，血流的很多。她丈夫急得直哭，手里没有钱，请医生也没处请。天刚亮，好心的邻居跑去找曹主任想办法。曹惠宾一听就赶忙跑到乡政府打电话。不到一小时，区卫生所的医生骑车子赶来了，打针抢救，忙了半天，血才止住了。王阿平的丈夫指着身边的三个男孩对我说：“孩子的娘要有三长两短，我们一家可就苦啦。”
    曹惠宾常去访问社里的困难户和五保户，随时帮助他们解决困难。去年春天，新社员陈永兴断了口粮。那时社里也没有钱。曹惠宾就回去和娘商量，在自己家里拿出五十多斤大米帮助陈永兴渡过了春荒。那些孤寡的老人看见曹主任来了，更像是见了亲人。有的说麦子没人磨，有的说屋子有点漏雨了，也有的说整天坐着怪闷的想做点轻便活。曹惠宾随时把他们的要求告诉队长，小队里总是马上把这些人照顾得妥妥贴贴的。
    8月里，台风刮坏了和平社二百多间草房。曹惠宾是社里党分支的书记。他在支部大会上动员共产党员要关心群众疾苦，帮助社员修房子。住房较宽的要借给群众暂住。社里拨出了两万斤草帮助社员。不到半个月，在共产党员的带动下，大家一齐动手，所有的房子都修好了。
    人们和我谈到的许许多多事情，使我明白了“好公”这个称呼里包含着多少热爱和尊敬啊！
    去和群众商量
    去年夏收的时候，雨水特别多。怎样能把长得穗穗饱满的一千多亩麦子安全地收到家，是个大问题。曹惠宾认为这是对高级社的第一次考验。当时，社员中普遍存在着“等天好”的消极情绪。曹惠宾和其他社干部们研究以后，决定分头去和群众商量。曹惠宾去向几个老农请教，有经验的老农提出了不少好建议。他又和社员一起算了一笔账：如果每亩少收十斤，社里就要少收一万六千斤麦子。等天好再收，损失就要更大。这一算，大家着急了，都说不能再等。社里集中了农民的经验，决定一面开沟排水，一面抢收，随收随分，并在各生产队增加临时仓库，解决仓库不足的困难。社员们积极地有秩序地行动起来了，在三天半时间内抢收完毕，比原来估计的时间缩短一半，获得了夏熟的空前丰收：元麦平均每亩产量三百五十七斤，小麦平均每亩产量二百二十六斤。
    曹惠宾和社里的主要干部，也善于听群众的反面意见，经常在接受这些意见后，改变他们原来的计划。曹惠宾说：群众的意见总要比少数几个人想的周到得多。
    越干越有劲
    1956年的春天，第四生产队刚从外村并到和平社来的时候，社员们根据他们过去生产搞不好的情况，都说这个队是“死落后”，担心它会影响全社。
    曹惠宾觉得这样看不对头，就到这个队去深入了解。原来这个队主要是被“穷”害苦了。二十六户人家只有两头牛，没有一只船，大部分社员生活困难。队长王瑞生生活也很困难，担心生产搞不好，要在大家面前丢脸。曹惠宾把这些情况在管理委员会上提出讨论以后，社里首先着手解决这个队的生活问题，给十八户发了生活贷款。社里又拨了牛、马、农船、农具和肥料支持这个队。社干部们在这个队里加强政治工作，提高群众的觉悟，并且又注意培养了一批积极分子，这样，这个队就一天天地变了样，社员们在生产上越干越有劲，由这个队负责耕种的农田产量比1955年大大提高了。
    曹惠宾常向社里的干部讲：能够了解群众的思想，体贴群众的甘苦，帮助他们解决困难，再去向他们说道理，讲政策，他们就能听得进去，群众就能发动起来，工作就能做好。
    曹惠宾自己就是这样做工作的。
