Talking About Some Biases in Investigation and Research
    Yang Yaohui

Investigation and research work is one of the fundamental methods for implementing the mass line and preventing bureaucracy. However, we must have a correct and realistic attitude towards investigation work, otherwise it will often be counterproductive, or even harmful. I feel that there are some biases in the current investigation and research work that must be overcome.

The most important and most common bias is treating investigation and research work with a subjective attitude. Investigation and research work should collect materials from various aspects and analyze the facts in a realistic manner with an honest attitude. However, many comrades do not do this when conducting investigation and research. They first have a set of personal opinions in their minds, and then they always try to make the objective reality conform to their own or the leader's intentions. They do not go to the objective reality to test their subjective understanding, but intentionally collect some materials to confirm their own or the leader's views. Let me give an example! In July last year, the Xiangtan Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hunan Province organized a working group to investigate the increase in the mass purchase rate in Bailian Commune, Xiangtan, in order to prepare the sales plan for the third and fourth quarters. A total of 30 typical households were investigated, and the results showed that the purchase rate of 11 households decreased due to reduced income, and the purchase power of the 30 households only increased by 16% when calculated together. The comrades who conducted the investigation, seeing that the newspaper announced an increase rate of 30% in a certain place, and believing that with cooperativization, more than 90% of the farmers would increase their income, completely ignored the situation of the 11 households with reduced income, and only calculated according to the 19 households with increased income and affluent life, thus reaching the conclusion that the market sales volume was large, wide, and concentrated. Based on this conclusion, they blindly purchased goods in large quantities, resulting in stockpiles.

Incompleteness, lack of depth, and lack of systematicness are the second type of bias in investigation and research. The existence of things themselves has integrity and systematicness. Therefore, we must collect as much material as possible when we investigate. However, some comrades who conduct investigation and research, after grasping the main aspects, ignore other relevant aspects; pay attention to advanced people and young people, and ignore backward people and old people; only want to listen to positive opinions, and do not want to listen to negative opinions; listen more to what cadres and activists say, and less to heartfelt talks with the masses after hard work and deep investigation; go more to advanced areas, and less to remote and backward areas. As a result, they often regard the opinions of a few people as the opinions of the majority; treat the situation of a local area as the overall situation; and comprehensively promote experiences that are only applicable to individual areas.

The third type of bias is the lack of serious and conscientious identification, inspection, synthesis, and analysis of the collected data in the investigation; even hearsay, echoing what others say, and collecting a lot of materials without thinking. Only investigating, but not researching, and not carrying out the work of eliminating the false and retaining the true, and going from the superficial to the essential, in the final analysis, still cannot correctly reflect the essence of objective things. Because each person who provides materials has different attitudes and viewpoints on the issue, the materials we learn are not necessarily all reliable. If we do not objectively analyze the source, representativeness, and correctness of the materials, how can we draw practical conclusions, and how can we correctly guide the work? Therefore, we must investigate and study at the same time, and in the investigation, we must achieve "prudent thinking and clear discrimination" with a strict and correct attitude and a keen eye, and repeatedly compare and contrast the positive and negative details. Only in this way can we find the correct and useful things.

In addition, some comrades lack a clear purpose in conducting investigation and research, and after a hard investigation, they gain nothing; and some units do not use the information obtained from investigation and research, or cannot use it in practical work in a timely and good manner, failing to play a role in promoting and guiding the work.

Things are constantly changing and developing. In order to avoid repeating the mistakes of subjectivism and bureaucracy in future work, we should study the documents of the "Eighth National Congress," understand the importance of investigation and research, go deep into the masses, and go deep into reality to conduct systematic and thorough investigation and research, and establish investigation and research work as a system, making it an effective method for us to grasp the situation, test policies, and connect with the masses in our actual work. In this way, we can do a better job in all aspects and rapidly advance the cause of socialism.

    谈调查研究中的一些偏向
    杨耀辉
    调查研究工作是贯彻执行群众路线、防止官僚主义的根本方法之一。但是对待调查工作也必须要有正确的、实事求是的态度，否则往往事倍功半，甚至有害无益。我感到目前调查研究工作中有下列一些偏向必须克服。
    最主要、最普遍的一种是以主观主义的态度对待调查研究工作。调查研究工作应该是从多方面搜集材料，用老老实实的态度，对事实进行实事求是的分析。但是不少同志在作调查研究时却不是这样，他们事先在脑中先有一套个人主见，下去后总是想法把客观实际来迁就自己的或领导的意图；他们不是到客观实际中去检验自己的主观认识，而是有意地搜集一些材料来证实自己的或领导的主见。还是举一个例子来说吧！去年7月间，湖南湘潭专区供销社，为了编制第三、四季度销售计划，组织了一个工作组到湘潭白莲社去调查群众购买率上升情况，共调查了三十个典型户，调查结果发现其中有十一户因减少收入购买率下降，三十户合并计算购买力只上升16％。调查的同志因看到报纸上公布某地增涨率为30％，又认为合作化了，90％以上的农民都会增加收入的，他们便完全不顾十一户减少收入的情况，只按照十九户增加收入、生活富裕的户来计算，从而得出市场销售量大、面广、集中的结论。根据这个结论就盲目地大批进货，结果造成了积压。
    不全面、不深入、不系统，是调查研究中的第二种偏向。事物本身的存在是有着完整性和系统性的，因此我们调查搜集材料时，必须是愈全面愈好。但我们有些作调查研究的同志，抓住了主要方面，就忽视其他有关方面；注意了先进人、青年人，忽视了后进人、老年人；只愿听取正面的意见，不愿听取反面的意见；听干部积极分子说的多，艰苦深入群众谈知心话少；工作先进地区去的多，偏僻后进地区去的少；结果往往把少数人的意见，看成大多数人的意见；把局部地区的情况，当作全面情况来对待；把只适用于个别地区的经验全面来推广。
    第三种偏向是调查中对搜集的资料缺乏严肃认真的鉴别、检查、综合、分析；甚至道听途说，人云亦云，毫不思索地搜集一大堆材料。只调查，不研究，不进行去伪存真、由表及里的工作，归根到底，仍然是不能正确地反映客观事物的本质的。因为每个提供材料的人对问题的态度、观点各有不同，因此我们所了解到的材料不一定都是可靠的。如果我们不客观地分析材料的来源、代表性、正确性，怎样能做出合乎实际的结论，又怎样能正确地指导工作呢？因此我们必须做到边调查、边研究，在调查中以严格的正确的态度和敏锐的眼光做到“慎思明辨”，把正、侧面的各个细节反复对照、比较，只有这样才能找出正确的有用的东西。
    此外，有的同志在进行调查研究时，事先缺乏明确的目的性，辛辛苦苦地调查一场，一无所用；也有些单位对调查研究得来的资料，备而不用，或不能及时地、很好地运用到实际工作中去，起不到推动与指导工作的作用。
    事物是在不断变化和发展着的，为了避免今后工作中不重犯主观主义、官僚主义的错误，我们应该通过学习“八大”文件，领会调查研究的重要，深入群众、深入实际去进行系统的、周密的调查研究，把调查研究工作形成制度，使它成为我们在实际工作中掌握情况、检验政策、联系群众的有效方法。这样我们就能把各项工作做的更好，把社会主义事业迅速推向前进。
