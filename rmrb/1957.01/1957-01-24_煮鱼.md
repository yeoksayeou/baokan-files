    Boiling Fish

    There was a kind old man whose friend gave him several goldfish. He was very happy and kept them in a glass tank in his courtyard. At that time, the weather was very cold, and the house was already heated. One evening, he stood by the tank, admiring these beloved goldfish; suddenly, a thought struck him. He thought since the weather is so cold and people are wearing so many clothes and still shivering from the cold, wouldn't the fish freeze in the water? Thinking of this, he ran around like an ant on a hot pan, extremely anxious.

    Suddenly, as if he had awakened, he quickly ran into the house, brought out a large basin of burning charcoal, and placed it around the fish tank, the charcoal fire burning brightly. He thought to himself that this way, the fish would be like people and no longer afraid of the cold. He secretly rejoiced that he had done another good deed.

    That night, the old man slept very soundly. The next morning, when he ran to the tank full of joy, the several stiff goldfish were floating upside down on the surface of the water, having been boiled.

    The well-intentioned old man did not do a good deed! Dong Wenbing

    煮鱼
    有一个善良的老人，他的朋友送他几尾金鱼。他很高兴，把它们养在庭院的琉璃缸里。那时候天气很冷，屋里已经烤起火了。这一天傍晚，他站在缸边欣赏这些心爱的金鱼；蓦地心里一动，想起了天气这么冷，人穿着许多衣服，还冷得直哆嗦，鱼在水里，那不冻坏了吗？想到这儿，像热锅里蚂蚁似地跑来跑去，着急得不得了。
    突然他像醒悟了似的，赶紧跑进屋，端出了一大盆炭火，倒在鱼缸的周围，炭火熊熊地燃烧起来。他心里想，这样鱼将和人一样，不再怕冷了。他暗暗庆幸自己又办了一桩好事。
    这个晚上，老头睡得很甜香。第二天清早，当他满怀高兴跑到缸边去的时候，几尾直挺挺的金鱼已翻着肚皮倒浮在水面上，原来鱼都煮熟了。
    好心的老人并没有办好事！　董文炳
