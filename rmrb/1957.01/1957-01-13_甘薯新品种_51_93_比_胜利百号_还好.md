A new, superior sweet potato variety, "51-93," has been successfully bred by the East China Agricultural Science Institute. Its yield surpasses the "Victory No. 100," which is known for its high yield.

The variety breeding experts in the Horticulture Department of the East China Agricultural Science Institute conducted sexual hybridization in 1951 using "Victory No. 100" as the female parent and "Nanrui Sweet Potato" as the male parent, and selected "51-93" from their offspring. After five years of dedicated cultivation by sweet potato breeding experts such as Zhang Bitai and other researchers, it has been proven that the "51-93" variety has a higher yield than "Victory No. 100." Comparing the yields as percentages: in 1955, "51-93" exceeded "Victory No. 100" by 12.9%, and in 1956, it exceeded it by 26.21%. Moreover, the nutritional components contained in "51-93," such as starch, sugar, and Vitamin A, are richer than in "Victory No. 100," and the sweetness of the taste cannot be compared to "Victory No. 100." At the same time, "51-93" also has many advantages: such as strong adaptability, stable yield, and early maturity.

In 1956, the "51-93" sweet potato was trial-planted in more than 20 locations in East China. According to the partial reports received, it has broad development prospects. According to the experts who cultivated this variety: Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, except for the sweet potato varieties in South China which were relatively good, the sweet potato varieties in other regions were very chaotic and the yields were very low. During the war, the Japanese introduced "Victory No. 100" (originally named "Okinawa No. 100" in Japan, its male parent was the Chaozhou species from China, and the female parent was the American "Seven Fortunes"). Because of its high yield, it gradually squeezed out the local species. After liberation, due to the vigorous promotion in various places, "Victory No. 100" developed even faster, almost covering the entire North China Plain and the Yangtze River Basin. However, the emergence of excellent varieties such as "51-93" and "North China-117" will cause competition among sweet potato varieties; and the first to be eliminated may be "Victory No. 100."

    甘薯新品种“51—93”比“胜利百号”还好
    本报讯　据江苏新华日报报道：一种优良的甘薯品种——“51—93”甘薯，已由华东农业科学研究所选育成功。它的产量超过了以丰产闻名的“胜利百号”。
    华东农业科学研究所园艺系品种培育专家们，在1951年以“胜利百号”为母本，“南瑞苕”为父本，进行有性杂交，并在它们的后代中选出了“51—93”。经过甘薯选种专家张必泰等研究人员五年的辛勤培育，证明“51—93”品种，比“胜利百号”产量高。两者产量相比，如以百分比计：1955年“51—93”超过“胜利百号”产量12.9％，1956年超过26.21％；而且“51—93”所含的营养成分，如淀粉、糖、维生素甲等都比“胜利百号”丰富，味道的甜美，“胜利百号”更不能与它相比。同时“51—93”还具有许多优点：如适应性强、产量稳定、早熟等。
    1956年，“51—93”甘薯在华东二十多个点试种，据已收到的部分报告看，它有着宽广的发展前途。据培育这个品种的专家们说：抗战前，除了在华南地区的甘薯品种较优良外，其他地区的甘薯品种十分混乱，产量很低。战时日本人引进了“胜利百号”（日本原名“冲绳百号”，它的父本是我国的潮州种，母种是美国的“七福”）。因为它的产量高，逐渐排挤本地种。解放以后，由于各地大力推广，“胜利百号”发展更快，几乎遍及整个华北平原和长江流域。但“51—93”与“华北—117”等优良品种的出现，将引起甘薯品种的竞争；而最先被淘汰的，可能就是“胜利百号”。
