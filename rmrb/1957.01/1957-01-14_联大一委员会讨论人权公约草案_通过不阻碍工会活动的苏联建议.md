Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 11th (TASS): The Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued its discussion at this session of the draft human rights covenants, which had already begun at the ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly. So far, the committee has discussed the articles in the draft Covenant on Economic and Social Rights regarding the right to work, the right to favorable working conditions, and the right of working people to form trade unions.

During the discussion of these articles, colonialist countries attempted to undermine the basic regulations proposed by the United Nations Human Rights Commission. The U.S. representative stated that the United States would not sign the human rights covenants formulated by the United Nations and would not ratify them. However, he indicated that, despite the U.S. government's negative attitude towards the proposition of concluding international treaties that promote respect for human rights in all countries, the U.S. government would safeguard the interests of private business owners during the discussion of this treaty.

The British representative, Elliot, in discussing the articles on the right to work, suggested deleting the provision that states should take concrete measures to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to maintain themselves through work.

During the discussion of the articles on the right of working people to form trade unions, representatives of colonialist countries also opposed the Soviet proposal that countries ensure that union activities are not impeded, and also opposed other progressive regulations aimed at guaranteeing union rights.

Representatives from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, Egypt, Syria, Uruguay, Greece, India, Indonesia, and other countries opposed the attitude taken by the representatives of colonialist countries. With the support of the majority of countries, despite the dissatisfaction of the colonialist countries, the committee ultimately passed the Soviet proposal on guaranteeing that union activities are not impeded by a majority vote, and rejected amendments aimed at deleting many progressive regulations from the draft covenants. For example, the article on the right to work was passed with forty-eight votes in favor and seventeen abstentions (including the United States, Britain, France, and other countries).

    联大一委员会讨论人权公约草案
    通过不阻碍工会活动的苏联建议
    据新华社13日讯　据塔斯社纽约11日讯：联合国大会社会，人道及文化委员会本届会议继续讨论在联合国大会第九届会议就已经开始讨论的由人权委员会起草的人权公约草案。到现在为止，委员会已经讨论了经济和社会权利公约草案中关于劳动权、良好的劳动条件权利和劳动人民建立工会的权利的条款。
    在讨论这些条款的过程中，殖民主义国家企图破坏联合国人权委员会所提出的基本条例。美国代表说，美国将不在联合国制定的人权公约上签字，并且也不批准这个公约。但是他表明，尽管美国政府对缔结促进各国尊重人权的国际条约这种主张抱否定态度，但是在讨论这个条约时，美国政府将维护私营企业主的利益。
    英国代表埃利奥特在讨论关于劳动权的条文时，建议从条文中删去关于各国采取具体措施，保证每一个人有可能以劳动维持自身生活的规定。
    在讨论关于劳动人民建立工会的权利的条文时，殖民主义国家代表也反对苏联提出的关于各国保证不阻挠工会活动的建议，并且还反对其他旨在保证工会权利的进步条例。
    苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、波兰、埃及、叙利亚、乌拉圭、希腊、印度、印度尼西亚和其他国家的代表反对殖民主义国家代表所采取的态度。在大多数国家的支持下，尽管殖民主义国家不满，委员会最后仍以多数票通过了苏联关于保证不阻碍工会活动的建议，并且否决了旨在从公约草案中删去许多进步条例的修正案。例如，关于劳动权利的条文以四十八票赞成，十七票弃权（其中包括美英法等国）获得通过。
