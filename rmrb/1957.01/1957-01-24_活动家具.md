    Activity Furniture
    A set of activity furniture for field workers, housed in a cabinet, has recently been trial-produced by the joint state-private owned Songhua River Furniture Factory in Harbin.
    When surveying personnel go out to work, they only need to take this cabinet, which is less than one person tall and about two and a half feet wide. When lodging, they can take out a folding single bed, a two-drawer desk, and a chair from inside. The empty cabinet can also be divided into two halves with wooden boards, one half for hanging clothes and the other for storing materials and office supplies. The activity furniture is solid and not easily damaged by frequent handling, with a total weight of only 75 kilograms.
    The activity furniture was designed by Zhang Gongmin, a staff member and private-sector employee of the Songhua River Furniture Factory, based on the needs of the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Department. Although this set of furniture still needs some improvements, it has been technically assessed and considered basically successful. (Xinhua News Agency)

    活动家具
    供给野外工作人员使用的一套装在柜子里的活动的家具，最近在哈尔滨市公私合营松花江家具厂试制出来。
    勘探人员外出工作，只要带上这个不到一人高、约二尺五寸宽的柜子，在住宿的时候，就可从里面取出折叠着的一张单人床、一张两屉办公桌和一把椅子。空柜子还可以用木板隔成两半，一半用来挂衣服，一半用来装材料和办公用品。活动家具质地牢固，经常搬运不容易损坏，全重只有七十五公斤。
    活动家具是松花江家具厂的职员、私方人员张功民根据青海省石油勘探部门的需要而设计的。虽然这套家具还待作某些改进，但是经过技术鉴定认为基本是成功的。　（新华社）
