Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 22nd: Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Syrian President Kuwatly issued a joint statement in New Delhi on January 21st stating that the countries of the Middle East must be able to "develop in complete freedom, without any foreign control, according to their own characteristics and traditions—especially in the economic and social fields—in order to improve the living standards of their people." Only in this way can the Middle East problem be resolved.

The statement said that their talks in New Delhi last week showed that both sides held "extremely similar views on many international issues" and reaffirmed their belief in the Bandung Principles. The statement said that the non-alignment policy pursued by both countries can make the best contribution to peace and harmony.

The statement warned that if Israeli troops continue to delay their withdrawal from Egyptian territory and the Gaza Strip, then "a new crisis is very likely to be created."

The statement expressed hope that the United Nations would guarantee the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops behind the armistice lines.

The statement criticized the use of "military means" to solve Middle East problems and condemned the Baghdad Pact.

The statement called for encouraging "progressive forces seeking freedom and stability and striving to realize the national aspirations of the people of this region." The statement believes that interference by major powers through military treaties and alliances "is detrimental to the peace and stability of the Middle East."

The statement reiterated its support for the cause of all peoples in the world under foreign control to strive for freedom and independence, and expressed the hope that "without further delay" the Algerian people "will be able to exercise their right to self-determination and independence."

    反对以军事办法解决中东问题
    希望联合国保证以军撤到停战线后面
    新华社新德里22日电　印度总理尼赫鲁和叙利亚总统库阿特利21日在新德里发表联合声明说：中东地区的国家必须能够“完全自由地在不受任何外国的控制的情况下按照自己的特点和传统——特别是在经济和社会方面——进行发展，以便提高自己的人民的生活水平”，只有这样，中东问题才会获得解决。
    声明说，他们上星期在新德里所举行的会谈表明，双方“在许多国际问题上观点极其相近”，并且再一次地表明，他们相信万隆原则。声明说，两国所执行的不参加集团的政策能够对和平和和谐作出最好的贡献。
    声明警告说，如果以色列军队继续迟迟不撤出埃及领土和加沙地带，那末“就很可能造成新的危机”。
    声明表示希望联合国保证以色列军队完全撤退到停战线后面去。
    声明抨击了以“军事办法”来解决中东问题的作法，谴责了巴格达条约。
    声明要求鼓励“谋求自由和稳定、为实现这一地区的人民的民族愿望而努力的进步的力量”。声明认为，大国通过军事条约和同盟来进行干涉，“是有损于中东的和平和稳定的。”
    声明再一次表示支持全世界受外国控制的各国人民争取自由和独立的事业，并且表示希望“不再拖延地使”阿尔及利亚人民“有可能行使自决权和独立权”。
