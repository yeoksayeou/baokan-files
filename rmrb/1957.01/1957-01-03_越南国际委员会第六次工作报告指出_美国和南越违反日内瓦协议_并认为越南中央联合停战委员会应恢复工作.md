Xinhua News Agency, January 2nd: The International Commission in Vietnam today released its sixth working report, once again exposing various facts of South Vietnam and the United States violating the Geneva Accords, and emphasized that the Central Joint Ceasefire Commission organized by both sides in Vietnam and its affiliated institutions should resume work.

This report was jointly submitted by all members of the International Commission in Vietnam. The report described the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam from December 11, 1955, to July 31, 1956, and the work of the International Commission.

The report pointed out that the International Fixed Inspection Teams stationed in South Vietnam continued to discover during the reporting period that U.S. military aircraft and military personnel were still constantly and illegally entering South Vietnam. The teams also discovered that some combat materials were illegally entering South Vietnam from the sea, including some landing craft. The report also pointed out that South Vietnam is continuing to prevent the International Commission from effectively supervising South Vietnam's compliance with regulations concerning the entry of military reinforcements from outside the country, by restricting the freedom of movement and inspection convenience of the International Fixed Inspection Teams stationed in various parts of South Vietnam.

During the reporting period, the International Commission continued to receive numerous accusations regarding the persecution of former resistance personnel by the South Vietnamese side. However, due to the South Vietnamese side's constant obstruction, it was difficult for the International Commission to send mobile inspection teams to investigate. The South Vietnamese side also continued to refuse to implement the decisions repeatedly made by the International Commission in the past, demanding the release of certain illegally detained individuals.

The International Commission also emphasized in the report the issue of resuming the work of the Central Joint Ceasefire Commission of Vietnam and its affiliated institutions. After the French troops withdrew from South Vietnam on April 28, 1956, France withdrew its delegation attending the joint ceasefire institutions, and the South Vietnamese side continued to insist on refusing to participate in these institutions, thus the work of these institutions was interrupted for a long time. The International Commission believes that the Central Joint Ceasefire Commission of Vietnam and its affiliated institutions are an integral part of the machinery for implementing the Geneva Accords, and the suspension of its work is not conducive to the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords. The International Commission advocates that the Central Joint Ceasefire Commission of Vietnam and its affiliated institutions should resume work.

    越南国际委员会第六次工作报告指出
    美国和南越违反日内瓦协议
    并认为越南中央联合停战委员会应恢复工作
    新华社2日讯　越南国际委员会今天发表了第六次工作报告，又一次揭露了南越和美国违反日内瓦协议的种种事实，并且强调提出越南双方所组织的中央联合停战委员会和它的附属机构应该恢复工作。
    这个报告是越南国际委员会的全体委员联名提出的。报告叙述了从1955年12月11日到1956年7月31日在越南实施日内瓦协议的情况和国际委员会的工作。
    报告指出，驻南越的国际固定视察小组在报告期间继续发现美国的军用飞机和军事人员仍然不断地非法进入南越。小组也发现有若干作战物资非法从海上进入南越，其中包括若干登陆艇。这份报告并且指出，南越还正在继续通过限制分驻南越各地的国际固定视察小组的行动自由和视察的便利的办法，使国际委员会不能有效地监督南越遵守有关不从境外进入军事增援的规定。
    在报告期间，国际委员会继续收到关于南越方面迫害前抗战人员的大量指控。但是，由于南越方面的百般阻挠，国际委员会难以派出机动视察小组对此进行调查。国际委员会过去所一再作出的要求南越方面释放某些被非法拘禁的人的决定，南越方面也仍然拒绝执行。
    国际委员会在报告中也着重提出了越南中央联合停战委员会和它的附属机构恢复工作的问题。在1956年4月28日法国军队撤出南越后，法国就撤回了它出席各联合停战机构的代表团，而南越方面又继续坚持拒绝参加这些机构，因此，这些机构的工作被长期中断。国际委员会认为，越南中央联合停战委员会和它的附属机构是执行日内瓦协议的机器的一个组成部分，它的停止工作不利于日内瓦协议的继续实施。国际委员会主张，越南中央联合停战委员会和它的附属机构应该恢复工作。
