    In My Alley
    Yeqü
    One night of cold wind brought the northern cold wave to Jiangnan. The climate immediately changed from warm autumn to winter: a layer of white frost covered the roofs and rapeseed fields, and thin ice floes floated in the mountain streams. In my alley, I no longer hear the various sounds that come with the seasons: the clear songs of orioles, the murmurs of swallows, the monotonous and sharp noises of cicadas, and the tea-picking mountain songs of women and children, sometimes near and sometimes far, sometimes high and sometimes low; only the sound of wind blowing fallen leaves and the sound of sweeping fallen leaves.

    Just after finishing supper, the female worker was cleaning up the bowls, chopsticks, and table. Suddenly, a burst of wailing, mixed with sharp curses, came from the alley.
    "Bang! Bang! Bang!" Several sounds like doors and windows colliding violently.
    I listened carefully; it was coming from diagonally opposite my house in the alley.
    "Go and see! 'Crooked Mouth' is arguing with her father and mother again!" I said to the female worker, "They are arguing so fiercely, don't let it lead to someone getting hurt!"
    The female worker ran down the mountain, and I followed her out of the house.
    The first night I moved into this alley, at the end of the year before last, I heard the sound of arguing in the alley. Since then, amidst the sounds of arguing and cursing, I began to get acquainted with this person surnamed Tang – whom the people in the alley called 'Crooked Mouth.'

    I have always opposed using nicknames based on a person's natural physical defects, such as calling someone with pockmarks on their face "Pockface" or someone with a limp "Limpfoot." A person's physical defect is not their own fault. However, the people in the alley are already used to calling her that, as if besides 'Crooked Mouth' – the protagonist of the family's quarrels – she has no other name.
    'Crooked Mouth' was originally the daughter of a landlord's family in Shangsi Township, Hang County. For some reason, her biological parents sent her to a farmer surnamed Tang in this alley as an adopted daughter when she was very young. Several years ago, the old couple surnamed Tang found a son-in-law for 'Crooked Mouth,' and she gave birth to a son and is now pregnant again. At the end of last year, a high tide of cooperativization was launched in the suburban countryside, and 'Crooked Mouth' and her family joined the West Lake Production Cooperative at that time. However, although the countryside is undergoing socialist transformation and construction, the thinking of some people has not been able to keep up with the changes in society, far from it. According to most people's assumptions: since people who are usually unfamiliar with each other can all produce together, then can't one's own relatives, father, mother, son, and daughter, labor and live together? Despite rural cooperativization, 'Crooked Mouth' still quarrels with her parents. In winter, probably because it is the off-season for farming, the number of quarrels is particularly high.
    I walked to the middle of the mountain and stood on the stone steps, listening attentively.
    "Even though they are not your biological parents, they have raised you painstakingly as if you were their own daughter!" It was clearly the voice of their production team leader from the cooperative.
    "Doesn't everyone have to grow up?" 'Crooked Mouth' replied in a shrill voice.
    "Can you grow up without eating?" A woman's voice.
    "You can't say such heartless words!" Again, the production team leader's voice.
    …………
    The crying had stopped, and the voices gradually quieted down.
    The female worker closed the door and returned to the mountain. I greeted her and asked, "What's going on?"
    "It was really bad tonight; they even kicked the door down!" The female worker replied, "Crooked Mouth is arguing with her father and mother about dividing the family property again. Actually, she just wants to force the two old people out because she doesn't want to support them in their old age." The female worker said, sighing, "It's really not easy to eat the food of the younger generation!"
    The female worker and I returned to the house together. As usual, I spread out my books, and she spread out her needlework. From spring to winter, she never finishes making shoes and clothes for her three children. The female worker graduated from junior high school. Although she is only thirty years old, she has already tasted the bitterness of the world. She was unfortunately abandoned by her husband and forced to work outside to support her children. She has had opportunities to remarry, but for the sake of her children, she has rejected all possibilities of happiness.
    "Some young people these days are really not kind, they are very ungrateful to their parents and have no filial piety at all! Once they can earn money themselves, they plan for their own happiness, which is nothing more than getting married, starting a family, and then separating from their parents. In reality, when they separate, the older generation suffers, and the younger generation also suffers. Look! This 'Crooked Mouth,' when she gives birth to her second child next year, she will know. These two old people, even if they cannot do heavy labor, they can always help with some housework. The care of relatives is hard to buy with money! Which one of us wasn't raised by our elders? But now some people always say that old people are bad, feudal, and backward. Who is responsible for constantly educating young people? Parents don't dare to educate them! In the past, parents educated their children and didn't keep anything for themselves. Now, I'm afraid that old people, in order to protect themselves in their old age, have to keep a little something for themselves. The old kung fu teachers, people say they always keep the last punch a secret from their disciples." The female worker said, raising her head and looking at me with a hesitant expression, as if asking, "Am I right?"
    "We should mobilize public opinion to oppose the abuse of the elderly! We should carry out education on respecting the old and cherishing the young!" I said, looking at the female worker, "Didn't the production team leader say very well tonight? It's clear that the cooperative is also paying attention to carrying out education."
    "That's because he himself is also an old person! As the saying goes: Only when you raise children do you know your parents' heart!" The female worker said with a smile.
    I no longer spoke, my gaze fell on the book, but my mind could not get rid of the crying, cursing, and the words of each person, as well as what I said to the female worker. Although the alley was in the quiet of a winter night, my mind was filled with agitated thoughts.

### 在我住的巷子里

    在我住的巷子里
    野渠
    一夜冷风，把北方的寒流吹到了江南。气候立刻从暖和的秋天转为冬天：屋顶和油菜地上铺着一层白白的霜，山边小溪里浮起了薄薄的冰片。在我住的巷子里再也听不到各种各样跟随季节而来的声音：黄莺的清歌、燕子的呢喃、知了的单调而尖锐的噪声，以及似远似近时高时低的妇女和儿童的采茶山歌；只有风吹落叶，落叶扫地的声音。
    刚吃完夜饭，女工正收拾干净碗、筷、桌子。突然，巷子里传来一阵号哭声，夹杂着尖锐的咒骂声。
    “砰！砰！砰！”好几下像是门、窗激烈地撞碰的声音。
    我细听，是巷子里斜对面传来的。
    “快去看看！歪嘴巴又同她的爷、娘吵架了！”我对女工说：“吵得这么厉害，别弄出人命来啦！”
    女工跑下山去，我也跟着出了屋子。
    前年年底我搬到这巷子里的第一个晚上，我听见巷子里的吵架声，从此，在吵架声和咒骂声中，我开始熟识了这一个姓汤的——巷子里的人叫做歪嘴巴——人家。
    我向来反对把绰号取在一个人天生的肉体的缺陷上，比方把面孔上生有麻子的人叫“麻子”，把脚有点拐的人叫“拐脚”，一个人肉体上的缺陷并不是自己的罪过。无奈巷子里的人已经这么叫惯了，仿佛除了歪嘴巴——这个人家吵架的主角，她再也没有别的名字了。
    歪嘴巴原是杭县上泗乡一个地主人家的女儿，不知道为什么，很小的时候，她的亲生父母把她送给这巷子里的一个汤姓农民做养女。好几年前，汤姓老夫妻给歪嘴巴招了一个女婿，生了一个儿子，现在又怀着孕。去年年底，郊区农村掀起了合作化高潮，歪嘴巴一家也就在那个时候参加了西湖生产合作社。然而，尽管农村在进行着社会主义的改造和建设，有一些人的思想却还不是能跟得上社会的变革，远远不是如此。照一般人的设想：既然平常不熟悉的人家大家都能在一起生产，那么自己的亲人，父、母、子、女难道反不能在一起劳动，一起生活？尽管农村合作化，歪嘴巴却还是和她的爷娘吵架，在冬天大约是农闲的原故，吵架的次数特别多些。
    我走到半山腰，就站在石级上，侧耳听着。
    “虽说不是你的亲生爷娘，他们可是把你当亲生女儿一样，辛辛苦苦养大的！”分明是社里他们的生产队长的声音。
    “人哪一个不要长大的？”歪嘴巴尖声地回答着。
    “不吃饭能长大么？”一个女人的声音。
    “你可不能讲这样没良心的话！”又是生产队长的话声。
    …………
    哭声已经停止，话声也渐渐静下来了。
    女工关上了门，回到山上来，我迎面问她：“怎么啦？”
    “今夜闹的真厉害，连门也踢破啦！”女工回答我说：“歪嘴巴又和他的爷、娘闹分家，其实只不过要把两个老人逼出去，不愿意养老年人。”女工说着，叹了一口气，说：“吃年青人的饭真不容易啊！”
    我和女工一同回到屋子里，像惯常一样，我摊开书，她摊开针线活。她从春天到冬天，永远做不完三个儿女的鞋子、衣服。女工曾经高小毕业，虽然只有三十岁，已经尝尽了人间的辛酸。她不幸被丈夫抛弃，被迫着出外做活来养活她的儿女。嫁人的机会并不是没有，为了儿女，她却拒绝了还有幸福的一切可能。
    “现在有的年青人真不大厚道，对爷、娘都很薄，没有一点孝道！一天自己能挣钱了，就打算自己的幸福，无非是结婚、成家，接着就和爷、娘分家。实在，分了家，老的一辈果然苦，小的一辈也苦。你看罢！这歪嘴巴，明年她生出第二个孩子来，她会知道的。这两个老年人，即使不能做重劳动，可也总帮着做些家务。亲人的照应，是有钱也难买得到啊！我们哪一个人不是从上辈的手抚育下长大的？可是现在有的人说起来总是老年人不好，封建、落后，谁来负责经常教育年青人啊？父母也不敢进行教育！从前父母教育子女什么也不保留给自己，如今，恐怕做老年人的，为了防老，不能不替自己留一点后步了。过去的拳教师，人家说总要留最后一拳不告诉徒弟的。”女工说着，抬起头来，带着犹疑的神色，望了望我，好像问：“我的话对不对呵？”
    “应当动员社会舆论来反对虐待老年人！应当进行敬老慈幼的教育！”我望着女工说：“今晚那生产队长的话不是说的很好？可见社里也注意进行教育呢。”
    “那是因为他自己也是一个上了年纪的人啊！俗话说：养儿才知父母心！”女工笑着说。
    我不再出声了，视线落到书本上，而我的脑子里却还不能排除刚才这些哭声、咒骂声和各个人的话，以及我自己对女工说的话。虽然这时的巷子里是一片冬夜的宁静，在我的脑子里却有着激动的思绪。
