    Local Party Committees Must Strengthen Political Leadership Over Exploration Teams
    To the Editor:
    Since the People's Daily published the editorial "Support the Exploration Teams," various localities have paid attention to and resolved many problems regarding the supply of materials, equipment, and necessities needed by the exploration teams. However, the phenomenon of indifference still exists in the political and ideological leadership of the exploration teams. This is because the leading organs in charge of the exploration teams are generally located far away and are responsible for administrative and operational leadership in terms of the division of labor. The local Party committees are responsible for the political and ideological work of the exploration teams. However, some local Party committees and responsible authorities rely on each other and are indifferent to each other. Some Party committees, even when they do manage things, only manage things like collecting Party membership dues, approving the development of Party members, or simply maintaining contact.

    Due to the lack of political leadership, coupled with conditional limitations, and the long-term inability to hear political reports, the political atmosphere in some exploration teams is weak, and the ideological level of the staff cannot be improved. The most important thing is that collective leadership cannot play its due role, and leadership methods cannot be improved in a timely manner. For example, in one team of the East China Geological Bureau, the opinions of the four captains could not be unified for a long time regarding a problem that was not important, which of course affected the work.

    I hope to improve this situation.

### 地方党委要加强对勘探队的政治领导

    地方党委要加强对勘探队的政治领导编辑同志：
    自人民日报发表了“支援勘探队”的社论后，各地对勘探队所需要的物资、材料、生活用品的供应等方面是引起了重视，也解决了不少问题，但是在对勘探队的政治思想领导上却仍然存在着两不管的现象。因为勘探队的主管领导机关，一般都距离很远，在领导分工上是负责行政、业务领导；有关勘探队的政治思想工作，都是由当地党委负责领导。而有的地方党委和主管机关又互相依赖、互相都不管，有的党委虽然管了，但也仅仅是管一管收缴党费，批准发展党员，或者是互相联系联系而已。
    由于缺乏政治领导，加之条件限制，长期听不到政治报告，因而使有些勘探队政治空气薄弱，工作人员的思想水平不能提高，最主要的是集体领导不能发挥应有的作用，领导方法不能及时改进。如华东地质分局有一个队为着一个并不重要的问题，四个队长的意见却长期不能统一，这样当然会影响工作。
    我希望改进这一状况。
