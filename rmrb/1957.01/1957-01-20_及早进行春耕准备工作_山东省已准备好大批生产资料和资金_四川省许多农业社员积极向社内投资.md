Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 19th. Shandong Province has made early preparations for a large quantity of production materials and funds to support farmers' spring plowing.

　　According to the needs of agricultural production development this year, the Shandong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative plans to supply more than 100 million jin of chemical fertilizers and more than 70 million jin of various miscellaneous and granular fertilizers in the first quarter, both of which are about double the amount of the same period last year. At present, these fertilizers have been directly allocated to county supply and marketing cooperatives and grassroots cooperatives, and some areas have already supplied them to agricultural cooperatives and farmers. In order to enable the new-style farm tools supplied to farmers last year to play a better role in this year's spring plowing, the Jinan, Yantai, Weixian, and Dezhou storage and transportation stations of the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative have now stored approximately 2 million pieces of various large and small parts for new-style farm tools. Among them, there are 50,000 plows and shares for double-wheeled double-share plows alone. Local supply and marketing cooperatives are also preparing to allocate and supply 7,000 head of livestock to rural areas in the spring.

　　The Shandong Provincial Branch of the Agricultural Bank of China and local credit cooperatives have also prepared funds for farmers' spring plowing production. It is estimated that approximately 100 million yuan will be loaned to farmers to purchase production materials in the first half of this year. Among them, the amount of loans from credit cooperatives will increase by nearly 7% compared with the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 18th. After completing the 1956 income distribution work, agricultural cooperatives in many areas of Sichuan Province have seen their members actively invest in their cooperatives to support the expansion of production. According to incomplete statistics from more than 26,000 cooperatives in Neijiang and Leshan prefectures alone, members have reported contributing 8 million yuan in cash to their cooperatives in the past month.

　　In 1956, the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations in Sichuan Province increased by 16.6% compared with 1955. The lives of members of agricultural cooperatives in many areas have improved, and they have a considerable amount of cash remaining. Therefore, these agricultural cooperatives are encouraging members to freely invest in the cooperatives to expand the cooperatives' production, in order to ensure a continued increase in income in 1957. They also clarified that these investments will be returned during the autumn harvest distribution in 1957, and interest will be calculated according to the local credit cooperative interest rate. As a result, many members enthusiastically contributed cash to the cooperatives. After Zhang Jiguang, the director of the Dazhong Agricultural Cooperative in Gaolan Township, Jingyan County, and Zhang Guangbing, the production team leader, invested 400 yuan in the cooperative, they motivated another twelve member households to invest 1,067 yuan in the cooperative. The Huohua Agricultural Cooperative in Yujia Township, Rong County, originally estimated that members would freely invest more than 100 yuan, but has now received more than 200 yuan.

    及早进行春耕准备工作
    山东省已准备好大批生产资料和资金
    四川省许多农业社员积极向社内投资
    新华社济南19日电　山东省支援农民春耕生产用的大批生产资料和资金已经及早准备停当。
    山东省供销合作社根据今年农业生产发展的需要，第一季度计划供应的化学肥料达一亿多斤，各种杂肥和颗粒肥料七千多万斤，都比去年同期增加约一倍。目前，这些肥料已经直接调拨到各县供销社和基层社，有的地区已经供应到农业社和农民手中。为了使去年供应给农民的新式农具，能在今年春耕中更好地发挥作用，省供销合作社的济南、烟台、潍县、德州等七个储运站，现在已经储备了各种新式农具上用的大小零件约两百多万件。其中双轮双铧犁上的犁、铧就有五万个。各地供销社还准备在春季调剂和供应农村牲畜七千多头。
    中国农业银行山东省分行和各地信用社，也为农民春耕生产准备好了资金，今年上半年贷给农民购置生产资料的款项，预计共可达到一亿元左右。其中信用合作社的贷款数量，将比去年同期增加近7％。
    新华社成都18日电　四川省许多地区的农业社在结束1956年收益分配工作以后，社员纷纷向社里自由投资，支持自己的社扩大生产。仅据内江、乐山两个专区两万六千多个社的不完全统计，在最近一个月内，社员自报向社投放的现金就已经达到八百万元。
    1956年四川省农业和副业的总收入比1955年增加了16.6％。许多地区的农业社社员生活有了改善，还剩余不少现金。因此，这些农业社都鼓励社员向社自由投资，扩大社的生产，以保证1957年继续增加收入，并且讲明这些投资在1957年秋收分配中归还，以及按照当地信用社利率计算利息。于是，许多社员踊跃向社投放了现金。井研县高澜乡大众农业社社长张吉光和生产队长张光炳向社里投资四百元以后，带动另外十二户社员也向社里投资一千零六十七元。荣县于家乡火花农业社原估计社员自由投资一百多元，现在已经收到了两百多元。
