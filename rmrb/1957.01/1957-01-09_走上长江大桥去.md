Walking on the Yangtze River Bridge
Xu Chi

As my car came down from the Jianghan Bridge and rounded a large roundabout with lush flowers and trees in the center of the street, I saw an unexpected row of red steel beams emerging on the horizon. I had only been away for half a year, but look at this red array, so neat and tidy, stretching out, stretching out. As we drove closer, it gradually rose from the horizon into the sky. So magnificent! I don't know why so many photographs fail to capture its actual grandeur.

The magnificent Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has claimed the entire sky here. It has made the scenery between Phoenix Mountain and Turtle Mountain complex, strange, and extremely beautiful. I drove around Lotus Lake towards the construction site. The closer I got, the larger, higher, and redder the row of red steel became. Standing under the bridge, looking up, it was truly a rainbow spanning the sky.

It cannot but be an internally stirring thing to walk on the Yangtze River Bridge. Not in imagination, not on blueprints, but on the real Yangtze River Bridge. I walked step by step, on the wide, steady bridge, straight towards the center of the river.

Naturally, before long, everyone will be able to walk on the Yangtze River Bridge. In the future, the citizens of Wuhan and travelers from north and south will take it for granted and no longer be surprised. But at this moment, I cannot help but be pleasantly surprised and marvel at this spectacle!

I first walked on the lower-level railway bridge of this double-deck bridge, which meant walking within the heavily layered and massive steel framework. Everyone wore willow safety helmets. The sound of rivet guns echoed constantly. A young female technician named Sang Juan accompanied me and explained things to me. She held a piece of chalk in her hand, as if she wanted to write or draw something on her palm whenever she spoke.

"Half a chopstick placed outside the table won't fall because the half of the chopstick inside the table balances it with its weight. We use this method to assemble steel beams, called the cantilever method. We first erect a balance beam at the bridgehead, then extend it outwards, cantilevering it into the air..."

This technician, who had just graduated from Tianjin Railway School last year, explained to me, telling me that according to the plan, the left bank was to erect the steel beams to Pier No. 3, completing three spans of beams before the New Year, and the right bank was to erect them to Pier No. 8 before the New Year, all of which have been completed. Then, she told me about rivets. The rivets here are particularly long. There are thousands of rivets on each connecting plate. She used to be a rivet analyst. She could tell the quality of a rivet at a glance. She would remove the bad ones and observe their filling degree from their five cross-sections. She spoke with such relish and with such brilliance!

Finally, we climbed onto the upper-level highway bridge of the double-deck bridge. We walked onto the wide highway bridge surface. Suddenly, we realized that we were at such a high altitude, that we were actually on a rainbow in the clouds. Looking down at the Yangtze River, it flowed beneath our feet.

"If you drop something down, it will drift for a long time before it falls onto the water surface," Sang Juan said, describing the height of the bridge. This height is necessary to allow ten-thousand-ton ships to pass through.

At this time, we set off from the bridgehead tower and moved forward. In a few months, people will be able to take elevators up to this bridgehead tower, and then set off in this way as well. Immediately, you will notice the clouds, right beside you. The three towns of Wuhan surround you, but below. Sampans, sailboats, and steamers are all below. Flying white gulls are also below. The water undulates at the very bottom, undulating.

"Here is the sidewalk, the trolleybus lane, the car lane..."

The guide continued to explain. We walked to Pier No. 1, to Pier No. 2, and were just feeling pleased when a wooden sign appeared: "Danger Ahead, Visitors Please Stop." Because Captain Gan of the riveting team had instructed her to let me see everything, we continued to move forward. Pre-fabricated concrete bridge decks were being laid in front. Further ahead, there were only narrow wooden planks. Looking down from both sides, all that could be seen were the huge steel beams painted with red primer, regular yet complex, like spider webs, facing against the river water. Approaching the sky above Pier No. 3, a thirty-five-ton crane blocked the way. We crawled under its chassis and reached what was temporarily the end of this Yangtze River Bridge under construction, a wooden railing.

Holding onto the railing, we admired the beautiful scenery on the river.

The ruins of the Yellow Crane Tower, on the opposite bank, directly faced us. There was also a red array stretching from there towards the center of the river. That side stretched over, this side stretched over. In a few months, they will be connected together.

Directly below was a world of shimmering scales, rippling waves, and tiny boats. Pier No. 5 was already towering from the middle. But Pier No. 4 was still under construction underwater, showing extraordinary tension. Suddenly, the iron arm of the thirty-five-ton crane above my head began to turn. It lifted a large member, suspending it in mid-air. Please look, right in the heart of the Yangtze River, in the high air above the river, with the river wind blowing from all sides, and at the very forefront of the red array, standing upright are several lone steel members being assembled. And on these members are our erection workers, crawling, lying down, bending over, raising their arms high, looking calm and composed, and as strong as iron men.

Ah! Erection workers in the sky above the Yangtze River!

"They are the boldest," Sang Juan said, explaining to me again.

They are already very skilled now, so these members can be quickly installed, inserted, and assembled. The steel beams of a bridge, weighing tens of thousands of tons, all have to be assembled by them, one member at a time.

I saw the erection worker on this side inserting that diagonal brace into the lower chord, and the erection worker on that side climbing all the way up to the top of a lonely flagpole-like vertical brace from a soft rope ladder. The crane was lifting another member. I was watching with fascination. Suddenly, Sang Juan disappeared.

I had no choice but to look for her everywhere. When I found her, she was钻 (zuān) in the middle of a group of steel beams. She was there, high in the air, sticking to the steel beams, turning over and over again. Heavens! From the gaps in those steel beams, you could see the deep below, the sparkling water waves. At this moment, I realized the use of the chalk in her hand. When she picked out unqualified rivets, she circled them with chalk and then put a cross through them.

Later, I heard that President Sukarno had been spreading the word everywhere, saying that he had seen Chinese female engineering personnel working on the Yangtze River Bridge as well as men. It turned out that he had met Sang Juan.

### 走上长江大桥去

    走上长江大桥去
    徐迟
    当我驰车从江汉桥下来，绕着一个花木扶疏的街心的大转盘拐了一个弯，我看见了完全没有预想到的，迎面的一排红色的钢梁，浮现在地平线上。我离开不过半年，可是，请看这红色的行列，整整齐齐的，伸展着，伸展着。在驰近时，它从地平线渐渐地升上了天空。那样雄伟！不知为什么许多照片都显不出它实际上的雄伟来。
    雄伟的武汉长江大桥已占领了这里的整个天空。它使凤凰山和龟山之间的一片风景变得复杂、奇异，而且美极了。我绕着莲花湖向工地而去。越逼近它，那红色的钢铁的行列越大、越高、越红。到了桥下，抬头一看，真是一道长虹，横贯天际。
    这不能不是一件令人内心激动的事，走上长江大桥去。不是在想像中，不是在蓝图上，而是在真的长江大桥上。我一步一步地走，在宽阔的、稳稳当当的桥上，直向江心走去。
    自然啰，不用多久，谁都可以走上长江大桥去。将来，武汉市民和南北旅客都会习以为常，不再惊异的。可是，此刻我不能不惊喜莫名，叹为奇观！
    我先走上这双层大桥的下层的铁路桥，那是走在重重叠叠的巨大的钢铁的框架里。人人头戴柳条安全帽。不断传来铆钉枪声。一个年轻女郎，名叫桑娟的技术员，陪着我给我说明。她手拿着一段粉笔，似乎一说什么就想用粉笔在手心里写或画似的。
    “半只筷子放在桌子外面，不会掉，因为桌子里面那半只筷子用它的重量平衡了它。我们拼装钢梁也用这方法，叫做悬臂法，先在桥头架好平衡梁，然后架出去，悬空的架出去……”
    这个去年刚从天津铁路学校毕业的技术员给我解说，告诉我，按照计划，左岸要把钢梁架到三号墩，架完三孔梁过年，右岸架到八号墩过年，都已经完成了。然后，她又给我讲铆钉。这里的铆钉特别长。每一块连结板上有上千只铆钉。她原来是个铆钉分析员。她对铆钉一看，便知质量好坏。把坏的取下来，从它的五个横断面观察它的垫充程度，她讲得多末津津有味，多末神啊！
    最后，我们爬上了双层大桥的上层的公路桥。我们走上宽阔的公路桥面了。忽然间发现，我们是在这样的高空，原来是在云端里的长虹上了。俯视长江，它在我们脚底下流过。
      “如果丢下一个东西去，它飘飘荡荡，好半天好半天才落到水面”，桑娟说，形容桥的高。为了让万吨轮船通过，它这样的高度是必要的。
    这时，我们从桥头堡出发前行。几月后，人们都可以坐电梯升上这桥头堡，然后也这样出发。立刻，你将注意到云彩，它就在你身边。武汉三镇环抱着，却在下面。划子、帆船、汽轮都在下面。飞翔的白鸥也在下面。水在最下面波动着，波动着。
      “这里是人行道、无轨电车道、汽车道……”
    解说员又说起来了。我们走到一号墩，走到二号墩，正觉得赏心悦目，出现了一块“前面危险，请参观者止步”的木牌。因为拼铆中队的甘队长嘱吩过她了，要让我看一切，我们继续上前去。前面正铺设预制的混凝土桥面。再往前去，只有狭窄的木跳板了。从两侧看下去，只见涂着红丹漆的巨大钢梁，规则而又复杂，如一个个蜘蛛网，逆着江水。将近三号墩的上空时，一台三十五吨大吊车拦住了路。我们从它的底盘下钻过去，到了暂时是这建设中的长江大桥的一个尽头的木栏杆处。
    扶栏杆，我们观赏江上美景。
    黄鹤楼遗址，在对岸，正冲着我们。也有一个红色的行列从那里向江心伸展。那边伸展过来，这边伸展过去。不消几个月，便要连结在一起。
    直下是鳞?的世界，粼粼的水波，小小的舟楫。五号墩已从中高耸。但四号墩还在水下施工，看得出非凡紧张呢。忽然，我头顶那三十五吨大吊车的铁臂转动起来。它吊动了一根大杆件，把它吊在半空。请看，就在长江的江心，在江上的高空中，四面吹来江上的风，而在红色行列的最前端，挺立着几根正在拼装之中的孤零零的钢铁杆件。而在这些杆件上，是爬着的、卧着的、弯腰的、高举两臂的、神色自若的、坚强如铁汉的，我们的装吊工。
    啊！长江上空的装吊工！
      “他们胆最大”，桑娟说，又给我解说起来。
    他们现在已经很熟练了，所以这些杆件能够很快的安上、插上、拼上。一座桥的钢梁，几万吨重，都要他们这样一个个杆件拼装起来的。
    只见这边的装吊工把那斜杆插进下弦杆去，那边的装吊工从一道软软的绳梯一直爬到一根孤独的旗杆似的竖杆顶上。大吊车又在提升另一根杆件了。我正看得出神。忽然，桑娟不见了。
    我不得不四处找她。我找到她时，她钻在一组钢梁中间。她在那里，高空，贴着钢梁翻过来又翻过去。天啊！从那钢梁的空隙中，能看见深深的下面，亮光光的水波。这时，我才知道她手中的粉笔的用途。她挑出不合格的铆钉时，就用粉笔圈上，再打个叉。
    后来，我听说苏加诺总统曾经到处宣传，说他看见中国的女工程人员，在长江大桥上，工作得和男子一般，原来他遇见的正是桑娟。
