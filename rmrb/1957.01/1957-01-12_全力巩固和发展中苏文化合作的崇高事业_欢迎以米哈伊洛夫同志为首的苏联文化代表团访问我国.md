    Vigorously Consolidate and Develop the Noble Cause of Sino-Soviet Cultural Cooperation
    —Welcoming the Soviet Cultural Delegation Headed by Comrade Mikhailov to Visit Our Country
    Qian Junrui, Acting Minister of Culture
    The "Cultural Cooperation Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics," signed on July 5, 1956, by representatives of the Chinese and Soviet governments, and subsequently ratified by the two governments, is a milestone in the further development of Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation. The first sentence of this agreement states explicitly: "In order to further strengthen the profound brotherly friendship between the two peoples, promote the rapid development of cultural construction in both countries, and safeguard the cause of world peace and human progress, the two governments, deeply desiring to fully consolidate and develop the cultural cooperative relations between China and the Soviet Union in accordance with the principles of mutual respect for national sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, and equality and mutual benefit, have decided to sign this agreement." This stipulates the noble purpose of developing cultural cooperation between our two great socialist fraternal allies.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have consistently regarded consolidating and developing the friendly cooperation of the socialist camp, especially consolidating and developing Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation, as their highest international obligation. Experience has proven that cultural exchange and cooperation are indeed extremely important and effective ways to consolidate and develop such friendly cooperation. For more than seven years, China and the Soviet Union have sent many delegations in the fields of culture, art, science, education, journalism, sports, etc., which have greatly enhanced the profound friendship between our two peoples. In addition, exchanges and translations of publications, exchange screenings of films, holding various exhibitions, scientific and technological cooperation, etc., have all powerfully enhanced the mutual understanding and love between the two peoples, thus further developing the friendship between the two peoples. At the same time, in all our speeches, we have resolutely refuted all the shameless rumors and conspiracies that attempt to slander and undermine Sino-Soviet friendship. From this, it can be seen that the main starting point and main goal of our further development of cultural cooperation is to enhance Sino-Soviet friendship. This is in line with the fundamental interests of the people of our two countries and the people of the world. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, if the people of China and the Soviet Union unite, the unity of the people of the world will not be difficult. And the unity of the people of the world means the final collapse of imperialism and the final victory of world peace, democracy, and socialism. From this perspective, we Chinese people, especially Chinese cultural workers, should make even greater efforts in the future to comprehensively and systematically introduce the struggles and lives of the Chinese people to our great friends and brothers, the Soviet people. Every delegation we send to the Soviet Union should bear such a responsibility, to introduce the situation in China to the Soviet people in detail from a certain aspect and from a certain perspective. We usually call friends "acquaintances," and the best friends "soulmates," because true friendship must be based on mutual understanding. And cultural exchange is indeed the most powerful tool to enhance mutual understanding between the two peoples. We should work harder and more effectively to use this tool.
    Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation must also effectively serve the socialist and communist construction of the two great countries. After the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance in 1950, Comrade Mao Zedong told people: The consistent belief of the Chinese Communists is that the Soviet Union's economic, cultural, and other important construction experiences are models for the construction of the new China. Therefore, the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong called on us to humbly and conscientiously learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and scientific and technological knowledge. For more than seven years, our country has sent various delegations to the Soviet Union and a large number of students and interns, and introduced various Soviet publications, films, and broadcasts, all in order to achieve the goal of learning from the Soviet Union. Facts have proved that as long as we can truly learn from the Soviet Union diligently and conscientiously, while also thinking independently and combining it with China's reality, rather than dogmatically copying mechanically, how much help the Soviet Union's advanced experience and scientific and technological knowledge have already provided to our socialist economic and cultural construction! Now, the people of our country are working hard with unparalleled confidence and intense labor to complete and overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan and prepare for the implementation of the second Five-Year Plan. Our cultural construction will be based on economic construction and will closely cooperate with economic construction to develop victoriously forward. In all aspects of cultural construction, we should continue to conscientiously learn from the Soviet Union's advanced cultural and scientific knowledge, closely combine it with our own reality, and creatively apply it to the construction work of various departments. It must be affirmed that the Soviet Union is the first country in human history to build socialism, and in the cultural field, it is the first country to create socialist culture. In this regard, it has extremely great achievements and extremely rich experience. We must continue to work hard to absorb the fruitful results of Soviet cultural construction to enrich the treasure house of our socialist culture. Regarding the experience of Soviet cultural construction, we should analyze it, combine it with our own reality, apply their successful parts, and at the same time, learn from their failures so that we do not take or take fewer detours. On the other hand, we should also continue to introduce our ancient and modern culture to the Soviet cultural and scientific circles and the broad masses of the people in a planned and step-by-step manner. In this regard, our past work has not been done well enough, and we should treat it as a serious internationalist responsibility and do this work well in the future.
    Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation has always been an integral part of the great cause of safeguarding world lasting peace and promoting human progress. The cultures of China and the Soviet Union are both great cultures of the people. They both belong to the people, and they both take the interests of the people as their orientation. In a fighting posture, they resolutely and thoroughly oppose all oppression, exploitation, retrogression, and evil in human society, and infinitely loyally safeguard human peace, justice, progress, and happiness. Our purpose in increasing cooperation in the cultural field is to increase our strength a hundredfold, so as to facilitate our victorious carrying out of this great battle that determines the fate of all mankind. Especially today, when the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has become a solid and powerful world system, and the political and military conspiracies of the imperialist aggressive groups have been repeatedly defeated miserably, we must always be vigilant against the vicious ideological erosion of international reactionaries. The recent anti-Soviet, anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-peace wave incited by the imperialists is an attempt to undermine the unity of the socialist camp and the unity of the people of all countries in the great struggle for peace and democracy in ideology and politics. Therefore, the primary task of our current cultural cooperation must be to thoroughly expose and smash this shameless conspiracy, to further consolidate and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to further strengthen the unity of the peace-loving and justice-upholding people of all countries in the world, so as to safeguard world peace and the cause of human progress.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation aimed at realizing the above-mentioned noble tasks has made great progress. From 1949 to 1956, a total of twenty-one art troupes with a total of 1,219 people were invited to China for visits and performances; during the same period, a total of twenty-one art troupes with a total of 983 people were invited by the Soviet side to visit and perform in the Soviet Union. In the past eight years, our country has translated more than 12,400 kinds of Soviet books, with a total of more than 191 million copies printed, of which the number of copies of the Complete Works of Lenin, Selected Works of Lenin, and Complete Works of Stalin accounted for a very large proportion. Since 1951, our country has successively sent students to study in the Soviet Union, and a total of more than 6,300 people have been sent in the past six years. After completing their studies and returning to China, these students will become a strong backbone in our socialist construction. Soviet films play a great educational role for the working people of our country, especially for young people. From 1949 to 1956, our country translated and screened 405 Soviet films, including 189 feature films and 155 scientific and educational films. The advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union has played a significant role in promoting and guiding our country's socialist industrialization and the progress of the entire construction cause. It should be particularly pointed out that in 1956, when our country was making comprehensive plans for the development of scientific research, a group of outstanding Soviet scientists came to our country and helped us complete this huge project with their profound knowledge and rich experience. It should also be mentioned that the Soviet government and scientists have given us various valuable assistance in the extremely important work of conducting atomic energy research in our country. In the work of learning advanced science and technology from the Soviet Union, Soviet science and technology books and periodicals have given us very important help. From 1950 to 1956, our country imported a total of more than 54,000 kinds of science and technology books and periodicals from the Soviet Union, with more than 53.7 million copies.
    The Sino-Soviet Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed last year summarizes the experience of cultural exchanges between the two countries over the years, and stipulates the general task and specific tasks of "consolidating and developing cooperation between the two countries in science, technology, education, literature, art, health, sports, news, publishing, broadcasting, television and other undertakings." This agreement will undoubtedly advance the cultural exchanges and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union to a new stage that is more comprehensive, more systematic, and more in-depth.
    In order to exchange the instruments of ratification of the aforementioned agreement in Beijing, and at the same time, in order to negotiate and sign the 1957 Sino-Soviet Cultural Cooperation Implementation Plan in accordance with the Cultural Cooperation Agreement, the Soviet government specially dispatched a cultural delegation headed by Comrade Mikhailov, Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union, to our country. Cultural, educational, and scientific workers and the broad masses of the people of our country express their heartfelt and warmest welcome to the comrades of the delegation of our great fraternal country, and believe that their visit to our country will certainly make extremely valuable and encouraging contributions to the continued enhancement of the cultural cooperation between China and the Soviet Union and the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. Just as our Premier Zhou Enlai is visiting the Soviet Union, and the closest unity between our two countries is being further strengthened today, we cheer to our dearest Soviet brothers: Long live the eternal and unbreakable great friendship between China and the Soviet Union! May the noble cause of Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation developed on the basis of this great friendship be infinitely prosperous and flourishing!

    全力巩固和发展中苏文化合作的崇高事业
    ——欢迎以米哈伊洛夫同志为首的苏联文化代表团访问我国
    文化部代理部长　钱俊瑞
    1956年7月5日由中苏两国政府代表签订的、以后又经两国政府先后批准的“中华人民共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟文化合作协定”是中苏两国文化合作进一步发展的里程碑。这个协定开宗明义第一句就写道：两国政府“为了进一步加强两国人民兄弟般的深厚友谊，促进两国文化建设的迅速发展，维护世界和平和人类进步事业，深愿遵照相互尊重国家主权、互不干涉内政及平等互利的原则，全力巩固和发展中苏两国的文化合作关系，决定签订本协定。”这就规定了我们这两个伟大的社会主义的兄弟盟邦发展文化合作的崇高目的。
    中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，一贯地以巩固和发展社会主义阵营的友好合作，首先是巩固和发展中苏两国的友好合作作为自己的最高的国际义务。经验证明文化的交流和合作确乎是巩固和发展这种友好合作的极其重要和极其有效的道路。七年多来，中苏两国之间互相派遣了许多文化、艺术、科学、教育、新闻、体育等方面的代表团，大大地增进了我们两国人民的深厚友谊。此外如出版物的交流、翻译，电影的交换放映，各种展览会的举办，科学技术的合作，等等，都十分有力地增进两国人民的相互了解和敬爱，因而更加发展了两国人民之间的友谊。同时，在我们的一切言论中，曾坚决地驳斥了一切企图中伤和破坏中苏友谊的无耻造谣和阴谋诡计。由此可知，我们进一步发展文化合作的主要出发点和主要的目标都在于增进中苏友好。这是符合于我们两国人民和全世界人民的根本利益的。正如毛泽东同志所说，中苏两国人民团结起来了，全世界人民的团结就不困难了。而全世界人民的团结就意味着帝国主义的最后垮台和全世界和平、民主、社会主义的最后胜利。从这一方面来说，我们中国人民、首先是中国的文化工作者，今后应当更加努力做好向我们的伟大朋友和兄弟苏联人民全面地和系统地介绍中国人民的奋斗和生活的工作。我们每一个访苏代表团都应该担负起这样的责任，就某一个方面和从某一个角度，给苏联人民详尽地介绍中国的情况。我们通常称朋友为“相知”，称最好的朋友为“知己”，就因为真实的友谊必须以相互理解为基础。而文化交流确是增进两国人民相互了解最有力的工具。我们应当更加努力更加有效地使用这个工具。
    中苏两国的文化合作同时必须为着两个伟大国家的社会主义和共产主义的建设有效地服务。毛泽东同志在1950年签订中苏友好同盟互助条约之后就告诉人们：中国共产党人历来的信念是：苏联经济文化及其他各项重要的建设经验是新中国建设的榜样。因而党和毛泽东同志号召我们虚心地认真地学习苏联的先进经验和科学技术知识。七年多来我国派遣了各种访苏代表团和大量的留学生、实习生，介绍了各种苏联出版物、电影和广播，都是为了要达到学习苏联的目的。事实证明，只要我们真正能够勤勤恳恳地、同时又能独立思考，结合中国实际地学习苏联，而不是教条主义地生套强搬，苏联的各项先进经验和科学技术知识对于我国的社会主义经济文化建设，已经有了多么大的帮助！现在我国人民都在以无比的信心和紧张的劳动为着完成和超额完成第一个五年计划并且准备实行第二个五年计划而奋斗。我国的文化建设将在经济建设的基础上，并且密切地配合着经济建设，胜利地往前发展。我们在文化建设的各个方面今后仍然应当认真地学习苏联先进的文化科学知识，密切地结合我国的实际，创造性地把它们运用到各部门的建设工作中去。必须肯定：苏联是人类历史上开天辟地第一个建设社会主义的国家，在文化领域内它是第一个创造社会主义文化的国家，在这方面它有极其伟大的成果和无比丰富的经验。我们对于苏联文化建设的丰硕成果必须继续努力吸收，来充实我国社会主义文化的宝库。对苏联文化建设的经验，我们应当有分析地，结合着自己的实际，运用他们成功的部分，同时领取他们的失败的教训，使自己不走或者少走弯路。另一方面，我们还应当有计划有步骤地继续向苏联文化科学界和广大人民介绍我国古代的和现代的文化。在这一方面，我们过去的工作做得很不够，今后应当把它当作一项严重的国际主义的责任来做好这一工作。
    中苏两国的文化合作从来就是保卫世界持久和平和促进人类进步的伟大事业的一个组成部分。中苏两国的文化都是伟大的人民的文化。它们都属于人民，它们一切以人民的利益为归依。它们以战斗的姿态，坚决地和彻底地反对人类社会中的一切压迫、剥削、倒退和邪恶，无限忠诚地保卫着人类的和平、正义、进步和幸福。我们在文化方面增进合作目的就在于百倍增强我们的力量，以利于我们胜利地进行这一决定全人类命运的伟大战斗。特别在今天，当以苏联为首的社会主义阵营已经成为坚如磐石、强大的世界体系，帝国主义侵略集团的政治军事阴谋一次又一次地遭受惨败的时候，我们必须时刻戒备着国际反动派的恶毒的思想侵蚀。最近帝国主义者所煽动的反苏、反共、反人民、反和平的浪潮，就是妄图在思想上和政治上破坏社会主义阵营的团结，破坏各国人民在争取和平与民主的伟大斗争中的团结。因此，当前我们的文化合作必须以彻底揭露和粉碎这种无耻阴谋为首要的任务，以进一步巩固和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，进一步加强世界各国爱好和平与正义的人民的团结，来维护世界和平和人类进步事业。
    从中华人民共和国成立以来，以实现上述崇高任务为目的的中苏文化合作有了巨大的发展。从1949年到1956年应我国邀请来华访问演出的艺术团体共有二十一个，共一千二百一十九人；在同时期内，我国应苏方邀请到苏联作访问演出的艺术团体有二十一个，共九百八十三人。在过去八年中，我国翻译了苏联各种书籍一万二千四百多种，共印行一亿九千一百多万册，其中列宁全集、列宁选集和斯大林全集的发行数占了极大的比重。从1951年开始，我国陆续派遣留学生到苏联去学习，六年来共派遣了六千三百多人，这批学员学成归国，将要成为我国社会主义建设中的有力的骨干。苏联电影对我国劳动人民、特别是对青年起着极大的教育作用，从1949年到1956年，我国翻译和放映了苏联电影四百零五部，其中故事片一百八十九部，科学教育片一百五十五部。苏联先进的科学技术对于我国的社会主义工业化和整个建设事业的前进起着显著的推动和指导作用。特别应该指出的，1956年当我国对发展科学研究工作进行全面规划的时候，苏联派出了一批杰出的科学家前来我国，以他们渊博的知识和丰富的经验，帮助我们完成这一巨大的工程。也应该提到，苏联政府和科学家们对我国进行原子能研究这一极其重要的工作中所给予我们的各种宝贵的帮助。在向苏联学习先进的科学技术的工作中，苏联科学技术书刊给了我们十分重要的帮助，从1950年到1956年，我国从苏联进口的各类科学技术书刊共五万四千多种，五千三百七十多万册。
    去年签订的中苏文化合作协定总结了多年来两国文化交流的经验，规定了“巩固和发展两国间的科学、技术、教育、文学、艺术、保健、体育、新闻、出版、广播、电视等事业的合作”的总的任务和各项具体任务。这一协定无疑地将使中苏两国的文化交流和合作推进到更加全面、更加有系统、更加深入的新阶段。
    苏联政府为了在北京互换上述协定的批准书，同时为了根据文化合作协定谈判和签订1957年的中苏文化合作执行计划，特地派遣以苏联文化部长米哈伊洛夫同志为首的文化代表团来到我国。我国文化教育科学工作者和广大人民对于我们的伟大的兄弟国家的代表团同志们表示衷心的和最热烈的欢迎，并且相信他们这次访问我国，一定会对中苏两国的文化合作和中苏两国人民的伟大友谊的继续增进作出极有价值的和令人鼓舞的贡献。正当我国周恩来总理访问苏联，我们两国最亲密的团结正进一步加强的今天，我们向我们的最亲爱的苏联兄弟们欢呼：中苏两国的永恒的牢不可破的伟大友谊万岁！在这种伟大友谊的基础上发展起来的中苏文化合作的崇高事业无限昌盛和繁荣！
