Xinhua News Agency, 20th - New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly concluded its discussion on the issue of Israel's failure to completely withdraw its troops from Egyptian territory on the morning of the 19th. The Assembly adopted a proposal put forward by the Asian-African group of twenty-five nations with seventy-four votes to two, and two abstentions. The proposal "regrettably and with concern notes that Israel has not complied with the provisions of the General Assembly resolution requiring the aggressors to immediately withdraw their troops from Egyptian territory." The proposal recommends that the Secretary-General of the United Nations "continue his efforts to ensure that Israel fulfills the aforementioned resolution and completely withdraws its troops, and recommends that a report on the implementation of the aforementioned resolution be submitted to the General Assembly within five days."

The two votes against the proposal were cast by France and Israel, and the abstentions were by Costa Rica and Cuba.

Speaking at the General Assembly yesterday morning were representatives from Burma, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, France, Belgium, Panama, Ireland, Australia, and Israel.

U Pe Khin of Burma pointed out that negotiations to resolve disputes could only begin after a peaceful atmosphere was established in the Near East. He stressed that such an atmosphere could only be created after Israeli troops withdrew to the demarcation line.

The representatives of France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, Australia, and Israel criticized the twenty-five-nation proposal to varying degrees, particularly the part of the proposal that: regrettably and with concern notes that Israel has not complied with the provisions of previous General Assembly resolutions.

Dutch representative Schurmann supported the proposal put forward by the representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and certain other countries, namely that the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba should not be handed over to Egypt, but to "UN Special Forces."

French representative Georges-Picot defended Israel. He said that at present, it is "unwise" for one party to "force" another party to accept conditions that have been rejected in the past. He also said that restoring "the situation that is the root of the scourge" is "reckless".

The French representative even insisted that if Israel implemented the United Nations General Assembly resolution, it would be subjected to an "economic blockade". Therefore, the French representative requested "certain guarantees" from the United Nations General Assembly to ensure that Egypt "respects" freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal and the Gulf of Aqaba.

Georges-Picot finally stated that he would vote against the Asian-African group's proposal.

Israeli representative Eban demanded the rejection of the twenty-five-nation proposal and defended Israel's unwillingness to return the Aqaba Gulf region and the Gaza Strip, which it had seized in the aggression, to Egypt.

The representatives of Lebanon and Egypt spoke in support of the twenty-five-nation proposal. They pointed out that this proposal was the bare minimum requirement. Lebanese representative Malik said that "justification for aggression is not allowed". He said that "some representatives are attempting to broaden the discussion" in order to include the entire Palestinian issue, and he called for not confusing this issue with the simple and obvious issue - the need to ensure the implementation of the United Nations resolution on the withdrawal of aggressor troops.

Egyptian representative Fawzi condemned attempts to divert the Assembly's attention from the specific issue at hand (namely, ensuring the immediate and complete implementation of the General Assembly resolution on Egypt's suffering aggression). Fawzi said that the issue is very clear. Israel should withdraw its troops from the Egyptian territory it occupies. It should do so immediately and unconditionally.

Subsequently, a vote was held on the twenty-five-nation proposal.

    联大通过亚非集团提案
    以色列侵略军应立即全部撤出埃及
    建议哈马舍尔德在五天内报告以军执行决议情况
    新华社20日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会19日上午结束了关于以色列不全部撤退它在埃及领土上的军队的问题的讨论。大会以七十四票对两票和两票弃权，通过了亚非集团二十五个国家提出的一项提案。提案“遗憾地、不安地指出，以色列没有执行大会关于要求侵略者立即把军队从埃及领土撤退的决议的规定。”提案建议联合国秘书长“继续努力，保证使以色列履行上述决议，全部撤退军队，并且建议在五天内向大会提出关于上述决议执行情况的报告”。
    对这个提案投反对票的是法国和以色列，弃权的是哥斯达黎加和古巴。
    在昨天上午大会上发言的有缅甸、荷兰、哥斯达黎加、法国、比利时、巴拿马、爱尔兰、澳大利亚和以色列的代表。
    缅甸代表吴佩广指出，只有在近东建立起和平气氛以后，解决争端问题的谈判才可能开始。他强调说，只有在以色列军队撤到分界线以后，这种气氛才能够建立起来。
    法国、荷兰、比利时、爱尔兰、澳大利亚和以色列的代表在不同程度上批评了二十五国的提案，特别是批评提案中这一部分：遗憾地、不安地指出，以色列没有执行大会以前决议的规定。
    荷兰代表舒尔曼支持美国、英国、澳大利亚和其他某些国家的代表提出的主张，即不把加沙地区和亚喀巴湾交给埃及，而是交给“联合国特别部队”。
    法国代表乔治—皮科替以色列辩护。他说，在目前，如果一方“强迫”另一方接受过去已经被拒绝的那些条件，这种做法是“不智的”。他还说，恢复“作为祸害根源的局面”是“轻率的”。
    法国代表甚至硬说，以色列执行了联合国大会的决议，就会使以色列受到“经济封锁”。因此法国代表要求从联合国大会“获得一定保证”，使埃及“尊重”苏伊士运河和亚喀巴湾的航行自由。
    乔治—皮科最后表示要投票反对亚非集团提案。
    以色列代表伊班要求否决二十五国提案，并且为以色列不愿意把在侵略中强占的亚喀巴湾地区和加沙地区交还埃及一事辩解。
    黎巴嫩和埃及的代表发言支持二十五国提案。他们指出，这个提案是最起码的要求。黎巴嫩代表马利克说，“不允许为侵略辩护”。他说，“有些代表企图扩大讨论”，以便把整个巴勒斯坦问题也包括进去，他呼吁不要把这个问题和简单而明显的问题——必须保证执行联合国关于撤退侵略军的决议这个问题混为一谈。
    埃及代表法齐谴责有人企图转移大会对当前具体问题（即保证立即彻底执行大会关于埃及遭受侵略的决议）的注意。法齐说，问题是十分明显的。以色列应该把军队撤出它所占领的埃及领土。它应该立即无条件地做到这一点。
    随后，就二十五国提案举行了投票。
