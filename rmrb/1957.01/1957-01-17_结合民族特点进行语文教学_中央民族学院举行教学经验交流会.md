Combining Ethnic Characteristics in Chinese Language Teaching
Central Institute for Nationalities Holds Teaching Experience Exchange Conference

(Our Dispatch) The first teaching experience exchange conference of the preparatory course of the Central Institute for Nationalities concluded on the 11th after three days of discussions. The ten special reports presented at the experience exchange conference summarized the experiences of teachers in various subjects over the past three years in combining ethnic characteristics in teaching.

The preparatory course includes more than 1,400 students from 41 ethnic groups, including more than 800 Tibetan students. The experience and issues raised by Tibetan language teacher Jiangba Danda regarding Tibetan language teaching were given importance. In his report, Jiangba Danda analyzed the characteristics of the Tibetan language and systematically summarized how to cultivate Tibetan students who do not know Tibetan to be competent in general business within three years (assuming four hours of class per week): able to understand general Tibetan newspapers and magazines, able to write letters and reports, and have a basic understanding of classical Chinese. This specific experience is to first learn and master Tibetan phonetics and single characters, and then use the new words in the text to describe everyday things and write short sentences to allow students to accumulate vocabulary, and then use narratives, stories, etc. as texts to learn grammar.

Chinese language teachers Pan Zhenyu and Zhao Kang's papers introduced their experiences in teaching Chinese language based on the characteristics of Uyghur and Tibetan students, respectively. After analyzing the students' uneven cultural level and language difficulties, they proposed how to break down the difficulties, first teach phonetics and tones, learn Chinese pronunciation, then focus on learning to recognize and write Chinese characters, and then achieve a stage of speaking, reading, and writing in parallel; and pay attention to adopting comparative teaching methods, comparing the differences between Chinese and Tibetan/Uyghur in word order, parts of speech, and grammar to deepen students' understanding of the laws and characteristics of Chinese. Teacher Zhang Yinchen's report also summarized the laws and characteristics of ethnic minority students learning Chinese language from the correction and explanation of compositions.

The specific content of the ethnic student characteristics analyzed by the reporters aroused great interest among the attendees. However, some people believe that some reports do not have sufficient research on ethnic characteristics and the estimates are not appropriate. Some people believe that the so-called ethnic characteristics should also be observed from the aspects of ethnic language, customs, religious beliefs, and national common psychology.

Representatives from national institutes across the country attended this discussion.

    结合民族特点进行语文教学
    中央民族学院举行教学经验交流会
    本报讯　中央民族学院预科第一次教学经验交流会经过三天的讨论，已于11日结束。经验交流会上提出的十篇专题报告，总结了三年多来各科教师如何结合民族特点进行教学的经验。
    预科包括四十一个民族共一千四百多学生，其中藏族学生就有八百多人。藏语教员江巴丹达提出的关于藏语文教学工作的经验和问题受到重视。江巴丹达在报告中，分析了藏文的特点后，系统地总结了如何在三年内（以每周上课四小时计算），培养藏族学生从不认识藏文到能够胜任一般业务：可以看懂一般藏文报章杂志，会写信、写报道，略通文言文。这个具体经验就是先学习掌握藏语拼音和单字，进而运用课文生字描述日常生活事物，写出短句以便学生积累词汇，再以记事、故事等为课文学习文法。
    汉语文教员潘振宇和赵康的论文，介绍了分别就维、藏语学生的特点进行汉语文教学的经验。他们分析了学生们文化程度不齐和语言困难特点后，提出了如何分散难点，先教拼音和声调，学习汉语发音，再重点学习认写汉字，然后达到说读写并进的阶段；并且注意采取比较教学法，对照汉语同藏、维语在语序、词性和语法等方面的不同，来加深学生对汉语文规律特点的认识。教员张茵陈的报告还从作文批改和评讲中，总结了少数民族学生学习汉语文的规律和特点。
    报告者所分析的民族学生特点的具体内容，引起了到会者们很大兴趣。但是，有人认为，有的报告对民族特点研究不充分，估计不恰当。有人认为，所谓民族特点还应该从民族语言、风俗习惯、宗教信仰和民族共同心理等方面来观察。
    出席这次讨论会的有全国各地民族学院的代表。
