Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, January 5th: The Syrian Parliament voted 69 to 4 with 46 abstentions on the evening of January 4th, expressing confidence in the newly formed al-Assali cabinet. The People's Party and the Constitutional Bloc abstained from voting.

The Syrian Parliament held a four-and-a-half-hour debate on January 3rd on Prime Minister al-Assali's policy statement. The policy statement indicated that Syria would pursue a "policy of active neutrality," continue to oppose the Baghdad Pact, and achieve the goals of the National Covenant.

The newly formed National Front supports the cabinet. The National Front includes the National Party, the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party, the Democratic Bloc, and most independent members of parliament.
