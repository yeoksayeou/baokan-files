Xinhua News Agency, January 25th, New York: The United Nations Security Council concluded its discussion on the Kashmir issue on the 24th. The meeting passed a proposal from the United States, Britain, Australia, Colombia, and Cuba, which reaffirmed the UN resolution of March 1951, advocating for a plebiscite under UN supervision to resolve the issue of Kashmir's accession. The proposal stated that any actions taken by the Kashmir Constituent Assembly to determine the future form and affiliation of the region could not be considered as complying with the aforementioned resolution. The proposal also indicated that the Security Council would continue to consider this dispute.

During the vote, ten votes, including those of the United States, Britain, and France, were in favor, while the Soviet representative abstained.

Before the vote, the meeting continued its discussion. Indian representative Menon stated in his speech that India would not agree to this proposal because the Security Council had no right to accuse India, India had a responsibility to safeguard its own rights, and the Security Council had no right to prevent a decision made by an elected Constituent Assembly regarding Kashmir's accession to India.

Soviet representative Sobolev said that the Kashmir issue was not caused by the people of Kashmir but was artificially created by some countries that wanted to create disputes in this part of the world so that they could infiltrate the region for strategic reasons. The solution to the Kashmir issue should be formulated through peaceful negotiations between the relevant countries, and the Security Council should make such a recommendation.

    安理会结束关于克什米尔问题的讨论
    印度代表不同意五国提案对印度的指责
    索波列夫建议由有关两国进行和平谈判
    据新华社25日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会24日结束了关于克什米尔问题的讨论。会议通过了美国、英国、澳大利亚、哥伦比亚和古巴的一项提案，这个提案重申联合国1951年3月的决议，主张在联合国监督下举行公民投票来解决克什米尔的归并问题。提案认为克什米尔制宪议会为决定这个地区未来形式和隶属问题而采取的任何行动都不能算是遵守上述决议。提案并且表示安全理事会要继续考虑这个争端。
    在表决时，美、英、法等十票赞成，苏联代表弃权。
    在表决前，会议继续进行讨论。印度代表梅农在发言中表示，印度不会同意这个提案，因为安全理事会无权指责印度，印度有责任维护自己的权利，而且，安理会无权制止由一个选举出来的制宪议会作出的关于克什米尔归并于印度的决定。
    苏联代表索波列夫说，克什米尔问题并不是克什米尔人民引起的，而是由一些国家人为地制造出来的，那些国家想在世界的这个地方引起纠纷，以便它们为了战略原因而渗入这个地区。解决克什米尔问题的办法应该由有关两国通过和平谈判来制定，安全理事会应该提出这样的建议。
