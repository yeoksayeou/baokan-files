    Saved Paper,
    Wasted Cement
    The Jiangxi Province Taihe County Water Conservancy Bureau transported four tons of cement from the Gan River by civilian boat. When the boat arrived in Taihe, only nine bags of the four tons of cement remained intact; the rest had spilled throughout the boat because the packaging paper was too thin. When the wind blew, dust flew everywhere; when the waves hit, it was a wet mess, resulting in a great loss.
    It is said that the thin packaging paper was a result of the Jiangnan Cement Factory's effort to carry out a production increase and savings campaign, changing the packaging paper from seven layers to four layers. One can't help but ask: Saving paper but wasting cement, is this the right thing to do?　Kang Chu

### 节约了纸张  浪费了水泥

    节约了纸张
    浪费了水泥
    江西省泰和县水利局从赣江用民船运来四吨水泥。船到泰和，四吨水泥只剩九包是好的，其余都因包装纸太薄，撒满船舱。风一吹，到处尘土飞扬；浪一打，更是湿淋淋的一片，损失很大。
    包装纸薄，据说是江南水泥厂为了开展增产节约运动，把包装纸从七层改为四层了。人们不禁要问：节约了纸张，浪费了水泥，这难道是正确的做法吗？　康楚
