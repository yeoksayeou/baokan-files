Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 23rd: The Vietnam National Assembly unanimously passed a resolution expressing confidence in the government on the evening of the 22nd.

The resolution stated: "The National Assembly unanimously welcomes and fully trusts the government led by President Ho Chi Minh." The resolution believes that in the past period, the achievements of the Vietnamese government's work were "major and fundamental," and "mistakes and shortcomings were local and temporary."

The 22nd was a day spent by the Vietnam National Assembly in a warm atmosphere and with intense work. In the morning, afternoon, and evening, the National Assembly respectively discussed and passed four resolutions on national defense, culture and society, ethnicity, and foreign affairs. In the afternoon, representatives of the Democratic Party and the Socialist Party expressed the political attitudes of their parties to the Assembly. In the evening, Premier Pham Van Dong, on behalf of the Vietnamese government, gave a comprehensive answer to the questions raised during the three days of group discussions and eleven days of assembly discussions, thereby concluding the National Assembly's agenda for discussing government work.

Up to the 22nd, the nine resolutions passed by the National Assembly were all achieved through detailed, repeated discussions and unanimous approval. After the passage of each resolution, all the representatives responded with warm applause.

Yang De Xian, secretary of the Democratic Party representing the Vietnamese bourgeoisie, stated in a concluding speech on the afternoon of the 22nd that the Democratic Party supports the government's policies and guidelines. Nguyen Chan, secretary of the Socialist Party representing Vietnamese intellectuals, emphasized in a concluding speech that the Socialist Party fully agrees with the government's policies and guidelines. The secretaries of both parties emphasized in their speeches that the democratic discussions of the National Assembly fully demonstrate the superiority of the political system in North Vietnam. They both expressed that their parties will do their part in the struggle to consolidate North Vietnam and strive for the reunification of Vietnam.

Premier Pham Van Dong said in his speech that the unanimity of the National Assembly demonstrates the unanimity of the National Assembly, the people, and the government. This shows that the policies of the Labor Party and the government are basically correct. The National Assembly believes that we have achieved many victories in the past two years, and these victories are fundamental. Affirming this point is of particular importance at present. Pham Van Dong also said that the government is willing to accept the criticisms of the National Assembly and is willing to resolutely correct some shortcomings in its work. He mentioned that there are still many difficulties in Vietnam, mainly financial difficulties. He said that as long as all the people can unite and work together, any difficulty can be overcome. His speech was constantly interrupted by applause.

After the resolution expressing confidence in the government was passed, all the representatives stood up, applauded, and shouted slogans. Finally, President Ho Chi Minh stood up and said: "On behalf of the government, I thank the National Assembly and thank the people!"

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 23rd: The Vietnam National Assembly decided this afternoon to leave the issue of amending the constitution for the next meeting to discuss.

In a resolution passed this afternoon, the National Assembly agreed to the proposal of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly to amend the constitution and authorized a constitutional amendment committee to be responsible for studying and drafting the draft amendment to the constitution. This draft will be submitted to the next National Assembly meeting for study.

The resolution unanimously passed by the representatives pointed out that the current Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a progressive constitution, but because the situation has undergone major developments, the constitution passed in 1946 must be revised and supplemented, "so that it can reflect the current actual situation of our society, record new victories, and clearly point out the direction of revolutionary progress, so that it can become a more solid foundation for the struggle to build a consolidated North and a unified country."

The meeting also heard a report on improving the organization of the National Assembly this morning, and the representatives will discuss this issue tomorrow.

    越南国民大会一致通过信任政府的决议
    认为政府过去的工作成绩是主要的、基本的，错误和缺点是局部的、暂时的
    新华社河内23日电　越南国民大会22日晚一致通过对政府表示信任的决议。
    决议说：“国民大会一致通过热烈欢迎和完全信任由胡志明主席领导的政府”。决议认为：越南政府在过去一个时期的工作中，“成绩是主要的、基本的”、“错误和缺点是局部的、暂时的”。
    22日，越南国民大会在热烈的气氛和紧张的工作中度过了一整天。上下午和晚间，国会分别讨论和通过了关于国防、文化社会、民族和外交的四个决议；下午，民主党和社会党的代表向大会表示了两党的政治态度；晚间，范文同总理代表越南政府对国会的三天小组讨论和十一天大会讨论中的问题作了总的解答；从而结束了国会对政府工作讨论的议程。
    截至22日为止在国民大会通过的九个决议，都是经过详细、反复的讨论和全体一致的通过达成的。在每一个决议通过之后，全场代表都报以热烈的鼓掌。
    代表越南资产阶级的民主党的书记杨德贤，22日下午在总结性的讲话中，表示民主党拥护政府的政策路线。代表越南知识分子的社会党的书记阮阐，在总结性发言中强调社会党完全同意政府的政策路线。这两个党的书记在讲话中都强调指出，国会的民主讨论，充分证明了越南北部政治制度的优越性。他们都表示他们的党将在巩固越南北部、争取实现越南统一的斗争中，尽自己的一分力量。
    范文同总理在发言中说，国会的一致，表示了国会、人民同政府的一致。这表示了劳动党和政府的政策基本是正确的。国会认为我们两年来取得了许多胜利，这些胜利是基本的，确认这点，在目前具有特别的重要性。范文同还说，政府愿意接受国会的批评，并愿决心改正工作中的一些缺点。他提到目前越南还存在许多困难，主要是财经方面的困难。他说，只要全体人民能够团结一致，共同努力，任何困难都是可以克服的。他的发言不断被掌声打断。
    在对政府表示信任的决议通过后，全体代表起立鼓掌并欢呼口号。最后，胡志明主席起立说：“我代表政府感谢国会、感谢人民！”
    新华社河内23日电　越南国民大会今天下午决定把修改宪法的问题留给下一次会议讨论。
    国民大会在今天下午通过的决议中，同意国民大会常务委员会提出的修改宪法的建议，并且授权给一个修改宪法委员会来负责研究和起草修改宪法的草案。这个草案将提交给下一次国民大会会议研究。
    代表们一致通过的决议指出，越南民主共和国目前的宪法是一部进步的宪法，但是由于形势已经有了重大的发展，在1946年通过的宪法必须加以修改和补充，“使它能够反映我们社会目前的实际情况，记下新的胜利和明确地指出革命前进的方向，以便使它成为建设巩固的北方和统一国家斗争的更加稳固的基础。”
    会议在今天上午还听取了关于健全国民大会组织的报告，代表们将在明天就这个问题进行讨论。
