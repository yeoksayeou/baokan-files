    Wealth Running Away from the Chimney
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Gu Tiefeng
    Not long ago, a civil aviation passenger plane braved the severe cold and flew from Harbin to Shenyang. When the plane flew over Shenyang, the entire city was shrouded in thick smoke. The pilot could not see the runway at the airport and had to find another way, forcing him to land at Changchun Airport far away.
    In Shenyang, chimneys of factories and houses for heating are numerous, constantly spewing out thick black smoke every day. Whenever it is morning or evening, when the air pressure is low, the thick smoke fills the entire Shenyang. During the day, pedestrians often have black coal dust stuck in their nostrils; at night, the street lights are also dim; on the white snow, there is a layer of black coal dust.
    Soviet expert Dorokhin, who was experiencing his first winter in Shenyang, had seen smoke in the Soviet Union that was generally pale white or pale yellow, but the smoke in Shenyang was thick black. On the plane, in the office, and on the road, he saw the thick smoke permeating Shenyang. The thick smoke damages the health of the residents, wastes the country's coal. Who knows how much coal ran away in the smoke!
    One day, he walked out of his room and dug up a piece of snow in the yard, melting it into snow water for testing. As a result, the snow covering an area of one-quarter of a square meter contained 655 milligrams of pure carbon. This interesting chemical test proved that a lot of coal dust mixed in the smoke and fell to the ground. According to rough calculations, the coal dust lost in the smoke throughout the city during the winter is about 3,100 tons.
    After research, expert Dorokhin recently submitted a suggestion to the relevant departments of Shenyang: workers should be quickly taught coal-saving combustion methods, and dust collectors and other equipment should be added to the boilers to save coal for the country and improve the health of the residents. At present, the relevant departments in Shenyang are studying this suggestion.

### 从烟囱里跑掉的财富

    从烟囱里跑掉的财富
    新华社记者　顾铁风
    在不久以前，有一架民航客机冒着严寒从哈尔滨飞来沈阳。当飞机飞临沈阳市上空的时候，全城已经被浓烟笼罩起来，飞机驾驶员看不清飞机场上的跑道，只好另想主意，被迫降落在远远的长春飞机场。
    在沈阳，工厂和房屋采暖的烟囱林立，每天从烟囱里不断冒出漆黑的浓烟。每当早晨或晚上，遇到气压低的时候，浓烟便弥漫整个沈阳。白天，行人鼻孔里常常粘着漆黑的煤末；晚上，街头灯光也暗淡失色；皑皑白雪上，浮上一层黑色的煤末。
    第一次在沈阳过冬的苏联专家多罗欣，他在苏联见过的烟色一般是淡白、淡黄的，但是，沈阳的烟色是浓黑的。在飞机上、在办公室里、在马路上，他都看见弥漫着沈阳市的浓烟。浓烟，损害着居民的健康，浪费着国家的煤炭，不知有多少煤炭从烟里跑掉了！
    有一天，他走出寝室，在院子里挖出一块雪，溶化成雪水进行了化验。结果，在四分之一平方公尺面积上的积雪里，含有纯炭六百五十五毫克。这次有趣的化验证明，混杂在烟里吹落在地上的煤末很多。据粗略计算，冬季全市混在烟里跑掉的煤末，大约有三千一百多吨。
    多罗欣专家经过研究以后，最近向沈阳市有关部门提出了一项建议：应该迅速教会工人省煤的燃烧方法，并且在锅炉上增设除尘器等设备，为国家节省煤，增进居民的身体健康。目前，沈阳市的有关部门正在研究这个建议。
