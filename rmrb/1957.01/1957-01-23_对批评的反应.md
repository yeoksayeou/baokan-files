    Response to Criticism

    The article "Selling Vigilance" published in the People's Daily on December 13th made correct criticisms of us. We have conducted a review of this matter. In addition to requiring the comrades directly responsible to make the necessary self-criticisms, we will also take certain measures to improve the system so that similar incidents do not occur again.

    对批评的反应
    人民日报12月13日所登“出卖警惕性”一文，对我们提出的批评是正确的。我们就这件事进行了检查。我们除要直接负责的同志作必要的检讨外，还采取一定措施来改进制度，使不再出现类似的事件。
