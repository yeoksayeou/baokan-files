    Thoughtful and Thorough

    All seventy-nine demobilized soldiers in Xiangbo Township, Haiyang County, Shandong Province, have been properly resettled. Currently, except for eight demobilized soldiers who have been transferred by higher authorities to participate in work elsewhere, the remaining seventy-one demobilized soldiers are working and producing in the township.

    The cadres of this township are exceptionally good at being considerate and caring for the hardships of demobilized soldiers and helping them solve various difficulties. Demobilized soldiers Jiang Jingxu and Jiang Jingqi were older and had not yet married, and their lives were quite lonely. Township head Xiang Junxiu thought: Demobilized soldiers fought for the country and the people, and didn't marry when they were young. Now that they've demobilized, can we let them remain bachelors for the rest of their lives? -- No, we can't. Therefore, he found Jiang Yup, the Party branch secretary of Laobo Village, to discuss how to help them solve their marriage problems. As a result, he introduced them to two widows from the township, and they got married. Disabled soldier Wang Xianrui was unable to find a partner for more than three years after returning home because his house was not spacious enough. Township head Xiang Junxiu personally helped him tidy up the house and asked the director of the women's association of Fangwuxiang to introduce him to a girl named Jiang Xiufeng, and they got married. Now they are living a very happy life. Last autumn, demobilized soldier Xiang Yingxi suddenly became seriously ill, and his life was in danger. The township cadres quickly found someone to carry him to the county hospital for treatment, and he soon recovered. Now Xiang Yingxi is working very enthusiastically in the cooperative.

    During the preliminary distribution last autumn, there were fourteen demobilized soldiers in the township whose allocated grain was not enough to eat for the whole year because they had large families and few laborers. Each agricultural production cooperative gave them preferential treatment for nine hundred and eighty-five workdays, so that each demobilized soldier received an average of more than seven hundred jin of grain and more than thirteen yuan, and their lives were not difficult. Because the demobilized soldiers in this township received such care and consideration, they are very active in their work. They regard building a new socialist countryside as their glorious task.

    山东海阳县项泊乡的七十九名复员军人，都得到了妥善安置，现在除了有八名复员军人被上级调出参加工作以外，其余七十一名复员军人都在本乡工作和生产。
    这个乡的干部，在体贴关怀复员军人的疾苦，帮助解决各种困难方面，是十分出色的。复员军人姜经绪和姜经起，年纪大了还没有结婚，日子过得挺寂寞。乡长项俊秀想：复员军人为了国家、人民作战，年轻时没有结婚，现在复员回来啦，还能叫他们打一辈子光棍吗？——不能。于是，他就找到涝泊村党支部书记姜玉丕，商议一定要设法帮助他俩解决婚姻问题。结果，介绍本乡两个寡妇和他们结了婚。残废军人王贤瑞，因为房子不宽敞，回家三年多也没能找上对象。乡长项俊秀亲自帮着他整理了房子，又托房屋乡的妇代会主任给介绍了一个叫姜秀凤的姑娘和他结了婚。如今日子过得挺美满。去年秋天，复员军人项英习忽然得了急病，生命很危险。乡干部就赶紧找人把他抬到县卫生院医治，不久病就好了。现在项英习在社里劳动得非常带劲。
    去年秋天预分时，全乡有十四名复员军人，因为家口多、劳动力少，分到的粮食不够全年吃的。各个农业生产合作社就优待了他们九百八十五个劳动日，这样，每一个复员军人平均都分到了七百多斤粮食和十三元多钱，生活就没有困难了。这个乡的复员军人由于受到了这样的关怀和照顾，劳动都非常积极，他们把建设社会主义的新农村，看成是自己的光荣任务。
