Recently, the bosses peddling the "Eisenhower Doctrine" have called the Middle East, where the Anglo-French aggressors have lost their power, a "power vacuum." This is truly "disregard for others."

They only see themselves and not others. They only see resources, profits, and weapons, and not the power of "people." Sometimes their eyes also see a dark mass of people—they only see many people with two legs in a daze, but they do not see the power generated by people's awakening. Therefore, in estimating their adventurous "great cause," they always forget the "human" factor, so that the ending is a bloody nose, and they still don't understand the crux of their failure. This should be regarded as a common disease once suffered by reactionary gamblers at home and abroad. Moreover, this "disease" seems to be incurable for the reactionaries. Even though they have had many experiences of getting sick, they still have to get sick. This can be proved from the "vacuum theory" of the peddlers of the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The Middle East, which has hundreds of millions of awakened people who are determined to "shed the last drop of blood" to defend their national independence and sovereign dignity, is actually a "vacuum" in their hazy vision!

We do not want to cure the incurable diseases of the reactionaries, but some facts that have shown the truth cannot be removed from memory. When the Nazi thugs were arrogant and aggressive, the German poet Brecht wrote a poem "Warning to the Nazis." In that poem, the poet warned the Nazi thugs not to ignore the factors of people and people's thoughts and spirits: once your drivers, pilots, and soldiers understand that they are doing shameful things for you, then you will be finished. The poet's "good intentions" naturally cannot shatter the illusions of Hitler and his ilk, because when they hold a large number of killing weapons in their hands, they not only cannot see the possibility of their soldiers awakening, but especially cannot see the power of the crowd standing opposite them. Probably in their view, the Eastern European regions at that time, such as Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Ukraine, and other places, as well as the outskirts of Moscow, were "vacuum" zones. This is also really "disregard for others," but the result was that they sent themselves to the grave.

We know more intimately what happened on our land, and these things are not completely unrelated to the bosses who are currently selling the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The reactionary rulers of old China had arranged a comparison table of Chinese and Japanese weapons to prove the "correctness" of the "non-resistance doctrine," which was that they admitted that there was no one in China in the face of foreign invaders. But when the "surplus materials" of American imperialism were used to equip them to deal with the people at home, they seemed to have three heads and six arms and were "very powerful." However, they became even more unable to see the vast crowd opposing the civil war standing opposite them. I think that at that time, they and their masters looked at the vast liberated areas and the whole of China as a "vacuum." But as a result, they became a small group of "pitiable worms weeping in a corner," and even their master's bloody hand quickly retracted from the mainland. The result of "disregard for others" is like this.

History has given the reactionaries enough lessons. As long as the people's strength in one corner of the world grows and clears away the local garbage and dirty things, the reactionaries look at that area as a "vacuum" and clamor to "fill it." Seriously speaking, where can a "vacuum" be found on the world political stage? And is there such a thing as a "vacuum"? It is precisely the location of political groups that are divorced from the interests of the people that is close to a "vacuum," or they themselves are "vacuum." Haven't we heard a prophecy saying that the culprit who launched the invasion of Korea was an outwardly strong but inwardly weak "paper tiger"? Later facts proved it was right. There will never be a vacuum where there are awakened and acting people. If the peddlers of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" do not believe it, and insist on ignoring the people of the Middle Eastern countries, and insist on treating the Middle Eastern countries that have driven away the Anglo-French bandit forces as a "vacuum," and attempt to swagger in to "fill" it, then the end will inevitably not be better than the Anglo-French aggressor forces.

    目中无人
    思白
    最近，兜售“艾森豪威尔主义”的老板们把英法侵略者已丧失了势力的中东地区叫做“势力真空”，这真是“目中无人”了。
    只看到自己，看不到旁人。只看到资源、利润、武器，看不到“人”的力量。有时眼睛里也看到一片黑压压的人群——只是昏头胀脑地看到是许多有两只脚的人，却看不到人们由觉悟所产生的力量，因而他们在估计自己冒险的“伟业”中，总是忘记了“人”的因素，以致结局是碰得头破血流，还不明白自己失败的症结所在；这应该算是中外反动的赌徒们曾经患过的通病了。并且，这种“病”，对反动派说来，似乎是已入膏肓，永远也治不好的了。纵然已有过多次的害病经验，但他们仍然要害下去。这从“艾森豪威尔主义”兜售者的“真空论”就可以证明。有着千百万觉醒起来的人民，以“流尽最后一滴血”的决心来捍卫自己民族独立和主权尊严的中东地带，在他们迷蒙的视线里，却居然是“真空”！
    我们不想为反动派医治他们的不治之症，但有些显示过真理的事实，却无法从记忆里除去。当纳粹党徒凶焰万丈、咄咄逼人的时候，记得德国诗人勃莱特写过一首“警告纳粹”的诗篇。在那篇诗里，诗人警告纳粹党徒们不要忽视人和人的思想精神的因素：一旦你们的司机、飞行员、士兵都懂得了他们为你干的是可耻的勾当，那你们就会完蛋了。诗人的“好心”自然惊不破希特勒之徒的迷梦，因为当他们手里握着大批杀人武器的时候，他们不但看不到自己的士兵有觉悟起来的可能，而且尤其看不到站在他对面的人群的威力。大概在他们看来，当时的东欧地区像奥地利、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、乌克兰等等地方以及莫斯科近郊都是“真空”地带。这也实在是“目中无人”了，结果却把他们自己送进了坟墓。
    我们更亲切地知道在我们国土上发生过的事，这些事也不是与目前贩卖“艾森豪威尔主义”的老板完全无关。旧中国的反动统治者曾排列过中日武器对照表来证明过“不抵抗主义”的“正确”，那也就是他们在外寇面前自认中国无人。但当美帝国主义的“剩余物资”一旦把他们装备起来对付国内人民的时候，他们就好像有了三头六臂，是“很厉害”的了，然而他们也就更加看不到站在他们对面的反内战的广大人群。我想大约那时他们和他们的主人看着广大的解放区以及全中国也是一片“真空”。但结果他们自己变成了一小撮“向隅而泣的可怜虫”，连他们主人那只血淋淋的手也赶快从大陆上缩回去了，“目中无人”的结果就是如此。
    历史给予反动派的教训够多的了。只要世界上那一个角落的人民力量生长起来清除了当地的垃圾和肮脏东西，反动派就望着那一带是“真空”而嚷叫着要“填补”了。认真说来，世界政治舞台上哪里才能发现“真空”呢？以及有没有“真空”的东西呢？正是脱离了人民利益的政治集团所在地，才近于“真空”，或者他们本身是“真空”。我们不是听到过一句预言，说那个发动侵略朝鲜的罪魁是个外强中干的“纸老虎”吗？后来的事实证明是对的。有了觉悟并行动起来的人民的地方，绝不会有真空的。“艾森豪威尔主义”的贩子们如不相信，定要无视中东各国的人民，定要把赶走了英法强盗势力的中东各国当成“真空”，企图大摇大摆的前来“填补”，那下场必然不会比英法侵略军好些。
