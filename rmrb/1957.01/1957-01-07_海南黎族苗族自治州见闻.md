Observations in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture
季音

After crossing the towering mountains of central Hainan Island, we arrived in Tongshi, nestled in the heart of the Wuzhi Mountains, on an afternoon in late autumn in October. Only two or three years ago, this was almost entirely a barren mountain. Now, a flat square, department stores, cooperatives, schools, a small power plant... have roughly outlined the contours of a mountain city. The Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee, the CPC Autonomous Prefecture Local Committee and other agencies are located here.

This Tongshi city, crude in its urban form yet full of vitality, seems to be an epitome of the entire Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. After a brief visit to the Autonomous Prefecture, we felt this even more strongly.

A Rich and Beautiful Region

The Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture is located in the southern half of Hainan Island, including seven counties: Baisha, Ledong, Baoting, Qiongzhong, Dongfang, Yaxian and Lingshui. The prefecture has a population of nearly 580,000, with more than 340,000 Li people, more than 12,000 Miao people, and the rest being Hui and Han people. The richness of this area left a deep impression on us. In October, the Songhua River in the Northeast was already covered in snow, but here it was a sea of green, with sunshine filling the mountains, and the climate like spring. Rows and clusters of coconut trees, betel nut trees, rubber trees, coffee, sisal, lemongrass... and various unknown plants, like a huge green carpet, densely covered the earth. Rice here can be harvested two or three times a year; the continuous mountains are covered with towering primeval forests, full of precious trees such as Musheng, Kuzi, Qingmei, Yingge, and Yan zhi, and also produce famous red and white rattan, kapok, medicinal herbs, and deer antlers. The underground also contains rich mineral deposits. Local comrades told us that, according to a rough survey in 1955, 288 mineral deposits have been discovered in the prefecture, including many important metals.

The work of developing and utilizing these resources has now begun.

Grain Production Increases

The main effort of the people of the Autonomous Prefecture is focused on agriculture, because agricultural production is the main source of livelihood for the people of the Autonomous Prefecture. A responsible comrade of the Autonomous Prefecture told us: The socialist transformation of agriculture has achieved a decisive victory in the Autonomous Prefecture. At present, there are 83 advanced cooperatives and 17 elementary cooperatives in the prefecture, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounts for 88% of the total number of peasant households.

Although the living standards of the people of the Autonomous Prefecture have greatly improved since liberation, the standard of living is still very low and production technology is still very backward. In the past, most areas here used cattle to tread the fields and thresh grain, and used their hands to twist rice; they did not fertilize, weed, kill insects, or use artificial irrigation when planting. After the realization of cooperativization, many cooperatives have purchased threshing machines, cultivators, five-step plows, sickles and other farm implements. It is said that the method of treading fields with cattle has been basically eliminated in the first half of 1956. Many cooperatives have learned field operations such as weeding, fertilizing, catching insects, and draining water. This year, most areas of the Autonomous Prefecture have achieved a bumper harvest. The agricultural areas we passed were full of golden rice fields, and the late rice was even better than the early rice. According to statistics from the Prefectural People's Committee, 94.6% of the cooperatives' early rice production increased in 1956, with the highest increase being more than three times, and the vast majority of cooperative members increased their income.

Development of Cash Crops

In the Autonomous Prefecture, we also saw rubber plantations and large-scale tropical crop farms. Tropical crop farms are planted with various tropical crops with high economic value, such as lemongrass that can be used to refine spices, sisal used to make strong ropes, as well as cinchona and pepper being tested. The Autonomous Prefecture now grows about twenty kinds of tropical economic crops, with a planting area of tens of millions of mu. Comrades in the Autonomous Prefecture said that they had subjectivist shortcomings in the development of economic crops, simply emphasizing increasing grain production and neglecting the development of tropical economic crops. In fact, this is a very fundamental way to solve the poverty of minority farmers. From the perspective of the overall interests of the country, it is also very necessary to develop tropical economic crops. This shortcoming has now been corrected. They have formulated a seven-year economic crop development plan, and the large-scale development of economic crops has begun. In the future, larger coconut groves, rubber plantations, and tropical crop farms will appear here.

Widespread Establishment of Commercial Networks

A commercial network serving the people of the Autonomous Prefecture has been established in remote mountain villages. According to statistics, there are now 171 commercial purchase and sales organizations in the prefecture. In some small villages and towns of the Autonomous Prefecture, we often see these small shops. The Li and Miao people sell their or the cooperative's local products such as kapok, red and white rattan, ramie, betel nut, and tussah silk, and exchange them for various daily necessities. The Li and Miao people welcome today's commercial institutions for historical reasons. Before liberation, some merchants often entered the mountains in the Wuzhi Mountains to conduct deceptive "transactions", but the current commercial departments fully implement reasonable equal value exchange.

An important factor that enables the establishment of commercial networks is the development of transportation. In the past, the Autonomous Prefecture only had a dilapidated "Haiya Highway" to connect with the outside world. Most of the current transportation lines, large and small, were built after liberation.

Leap in Culture and Education

In Tongshi, we also saw some schools, one of which was a normal school. These schools were near where we were staying, and we could hear loud singing and the sounds of activity from the sports field from time to time. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we could not visit. A comrade from the Prefectural People's Committee told us that the development of culture and education is one of the biggest changes in the Autonomous Prefecture. Before liberation, there were only five elementary schools in Baoting, with 225 students, all children of landlords, and all farmers in the prefecture were illiterate. Now there are 525 elementary schools in the prefecture, with 1,484 classes and 54,148 students. There are five secondary schools with 2,177 students. What a huge leap!

Speaking of this, I would like to mention the cultural and artistic activities of the Autonomous Prefecture. The Li and Miao people here are very good at singing and dancing, and can compose beautiful and moving songs. In Guangzhou, we happened to see a performance by a song and dance troupe from here. The performance amazed the audience, and some international friends in the audience went backstage to congratulate and thank the performers. After arriving in the Autonomous Prefecture, we realized that the achievements of this song and dance troupe were not accidental, but that it had such fertile soil. In this small Autonomous Prefecture, there are now 54 amateur drama troupes and 148 clubs, in addition to two professional drama troupes. And outside this organized literary and artistic team, I wonder how many unorganized folk singers and dancers there are.

Decrease in Population Mortality Rate

Due to poor medical and health conditions, the mortality rate of people in the Autonomous Prefecture was high before liberation. At that time, there were only three incomplete small clinics in the seven counties, without a single bed or any modern medical equipment. Highly infectious diseases often ravaged the mountains, taking the lives of a large number of people every year. After liberation, the Party and government of the Autonomous Prefecture paid special attention to health here. Now the prefecture has established 46 medical institutions such as hospitals, health and epidemic prevention stations, leprosy prevention stations, and maternity and child health centers, with more than 300 beds and some modern equipment. Highly infectious diseases have been basically controlled. The prefecture has also established 277 new-style midwifery stations, which have significantly reduced the infant mortality rate. This is what the minority people here are most happy about.

Finally, I would like to say the most important point, that is, in the past few years, the Party's organization has developed in the Autonomous Prefecture, and ethnic minority cadres have grown up. In many leading agencies and work departments, there are an increasing number of ethnic minority cadres working. I don't want to cite a lot of specific figures in this regard. In the Autonomous Prefecture, we met many such newly grown ethnic minority cadres, whose characteristics are simplicity, diligence, and enthusiasm. Although language barriers prevent us from directly talking freely, the impression they left on us is as unforgettable as our other experiences in the Autonomous Prefecture.

    海南黎族苗族自治州见闻
    季音
    翻过了海南岛中部的崇山峻岭，我们在10月深秋的一个下午，来到了五指山腹地的通什。两、三年以前，这里几乎还是一无所有的一座荒山，现在，平坦的广场、百货商店、合作社、学校、小型发电厂，……已经粗粗地构成了一座山城的轮廓。海南黎族苗族自治州人民委员会、中共自治州地方委员会等机关，都设在这里。
    这座粗具城市雏形、并且充满生气的通什市，仿佛就是整个黎族苗族自治州的一个缩影。我们在自治州作了短促的访问之后，更有这样的感觉。
    富饶美丽的地区
    海南黎族苗族自治州在海南岛的南半部，共包括白沙、乐东、保亭、琼中、东方、崖县、陵水七个县，全州有近五十八万人口，黎族占三十四万多人，苗族一万二千多人，其余是回族和汉族。这一带的富饶，给我们留下了深刻的印象。10月，在东北的松花江边，该已经白雪迷茫了，但是这里却是遍野碧绿，阳光满山，气候如春。一排排、一簇簇的椰子树、槟榔树、橡胶树、咖啡、剑麻、香茅……，以及各种不知名的草木，像一幅巨大的绿色绒毯，密密地复盖着大地。这里的稻子一年可以收两季或三季；连绵的山岭上，遍生着参天的原始森林，长满着母生、苦子、青梅、英哥、胭脂等等的珍贵树木，还出产着著名的红白藤、木棉、药材和鹿茸。这里的地下更蕴藏着丰富的矿藏，当地同志告诉我们说，据1955年的粗略调查，全州已发现有二百八十八处矿藏，这些矿藏中包括许多重要的金属。
    开发、利用这些资源的工作，现在已在开始了。粮食产量增　加
    自治州人民的主要努力是放在农业方面，因为农业生产是自治州人民的主要生活来源。自治州的一位负责同志告诉我们：农业的社会主义改造在自治州已取得决定性胜利，现在全州已有八十三个高级社，十七个初级社，入社农户占总农户的88％。
    自治州人民的生活在解放后虽有很大提高，但生活水平还很低，生产技术还很落后，过去这里大部分地区是用牛踏田、踏脱粒，用手捻稻；种田不施肥，不除草，不杀虫，不用人工灌溉。在实现了合作化之后，很多合作社都购置了打谷机、中耕器、五一步犁、镰刀等等农具。据说用牛踏田的方法，在1956年上半年已经基本上消灭了。许多合作社学会了除草、施肥、捉虫、排水等田间操作。今年自治州的大部分地区获得了丰收。我们经过的农业地区，到处是一片片金黄色的稻子，晚稻比早稻还好。据州人民委员会统计，1956年，94.6％的合作社的早稻，都增产了，最高的社增产三倍以上，绝大部分社员增加了收入。
    经济作物发展
    在自治州，我们还看到了橡胶园和很大规模的热带作物农场。热带作物农场里栽种着经济价值很高的各种热带作物，如可以炼制香料的香茅草，制作坚韧绳索用的剑麻，还有在试种的金鸡纳霜、胡椒，等等。自治州现在种的热带经济作物约有二十余种，种植面积有数千万亩。自治州的同志说，他们在发展经济作物方面曾经有过主观主义的缺点，单纯强调增产粮食，忽视了发展热带经济作物，而实际上这是解决少数民族农民生活贫困的一个很根本的途径，从国家的整体利益来说，发展热带经济作物也非常需要。这个缺点现在已经纠正了。他们已制定了一个七年经济作物发展规划，大规模发展经济作物的工作已经开始。将来，更大的椰子林、橡胶园，以及热带作物场，将在这儿出现。
    商业网普遍建立
    为自治州人民服务的商业网，已经在偏僻的山乡里建立起来了。据统计商业购销机构现在全州已有一百七十一个。在自治州的一些小村镇里，我们时常看到这种小商店。黎族苗族人民把自己或社里生产的木棉、红白藤、山麻、槟榔、天蚕丝等土特产，送去出售，换回各种生活用品。黎族苗族的人民欢迎今天的商业机构是有历史原因的。解放前，五指山区常有一些商人进山来作欺骗“交易”，但是现在的商业部门完全实行合理的等价交换。
    使得商业网得以建立的一个重要因素是交通运输事业的发展。过去，自治州只有一条破破烂烂的“海崖公路”与外地联系。现在的大大小小的运输线绝大部分是解放以后修筑的。
    文化教育的飞跃
    在通什，我们还看到了一些学校，其中有一个是师范学校。这些学校就在我们住处的附近，那里不时地传来嘹亮歌声和运动场上的喧哗。可惜我们因时间所限，不能去参观。州人民委员会的一位同志对我们说，文化教育方面的发展，是自治州最大的变化之一。解放前，全州只有在保亭有五个小学，二百二十五个学生，都是地主子弟，全州的农民都是文盲。现在全州已有小学五百二十五个，一千四百八十四班，学生五万四千一百四十八名。中等学校有五个，学生二千一百七十七人。这是一个多么巨大的飞跃！
    说到这里，我想再提一提自治州的文艺活动。这里的黎族苗族人民非常擅长歌舞，能编出美丽动人的歌曲。在广州时，我们凑巧看到了从这里去的一个歌舞团的演出，这次演出使全场的人赞叹不绝，场上的一些国际友人，都到后台去向演员们祝贺致谢。到了自治州以后，我们才知道这个歌舞团的成就不是偶然的，原来它有着多么肥沃的土壤呵。在这个不大的自治州里，现在竟有着五十四个业余剧团，一百四十八个俱乐部，另外有二个职业剧团。而在这支有组织的文艺队伍之外，不知还有着多少无组织的民间歌舞家呢。人口死亡率降　低由于医药卫生条件太差，解放前自治州人的死亡率高。当时这里七个县只有三个残缺不全的小医务所，没有一张病床和一点近代医疗设备。烈性传染病经常在山区肆虐，每年都要夺去大批人的生命。解放之后，自治州的党和政府对这里的卫生特别重视。现在全州已建立了医院、卫生防疫站、麻疯防治站、妇幼保健所等医疗机构四十六个，有了三百多张病床和一些近代设备，烈性传染病已基本上控制住了。全州还建立了二百七十七个新法接生站，使婴孩的死亡率显著降低了，这是这里的少数民族人民最感到高兴的事情。
    最后，我还要说一说最重要的一点，这就是自治州几年来，党的组织发展了，民族干部成长起来了。在许多领导机关和工作部门里，都有了数量日益增多的少数民族干部在工作。在这方面我不想再举一大堆具体的数字。在自治州，我们遇到了不少这种新成长起来的少数民族的干部，单纯、勤劳、热情，是他们的特点，虽然言语的隔阂使我们不能直接畅谈，但是他们留给我们的印象正同我们在自治州的其他见闻一样是永不能忘的。（附图片）
