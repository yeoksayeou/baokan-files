	The Lesson of "Three Lamps and One Donkey"
	Zhong Qing
	The National Music and Dance Performance of Professional Troupes, eagerly awaited by dance workers nationwide, is currently being held in Beijing. Every art performance inevitably produces some excellent programs, and promoting and learning from these excellent programs is, of course, an indispensable and important part of the performance. However, how to promote and learn from excellent programs is a problem worth noting.
	In the first National Music and Dance Performance, excellent dance programs such as "Huagudeng (Flower Drum Lantern)," "Caichadeng (Tea-picking Lantern)," and "Paolü (Running Donkey)" appeared. In the fourth and fifth World Youth Festivals, programs such as "Lotus Dance," "Ordos Dance," and "Friendship Dance" won international honors. Therefore, a high tide of learning these excellent programs was set off in the national dance community. However, the result of promoting and learning these programs was that almost all programs staged by song and dance troupes across the country, regardless of size (including professional and amateur troupes), were inseparable from "Three Lamps and One Donkey" (referring to "Lotus Lantern," "Tea-picking Lantern," "Flower Drum Lantern," and "Running Donkey").
	There are quite a few song and dance troupes in our country. But judging from the programs staged, they are a bit monotonous. It is rare to see different types of song and dance troupes have their own different programs and unique artistic styles. Whether each song and dance troupe can have its own artistic style and characteristics is a matter of principle. An audience member who likes to watch dance performances may see "Lotus Dance" and "Tea-picking Butterfly Catching" more than twenty times in a short period of time. And precisely because of this, some programs that were originally very popular with the audience often end up boring the audience, and even causing protests.
	Thus, a strange phenomenon has arisen: some song and dance troupes do not create new programs for a long time, but can perform regularly; some choreographers do not create anything for a long time, but carry the title of "choreographer." Because these song and dance troupes do not create their own works, they can stage excellent programs created by others. Although these choreographers do not create their own works, they can take the excellent programs created by others and "adapt" or "process" them. Of course, this is not a bad thing, but often someone will put their own "choreographer" title on the results of others' hard work. Sometimes, a very good program is adapted beyond recognition. On closer inspection, this situation is contrary to the policy of promoting dance creation. One central art troupe used the content of such an evening party—Lotus Dance, Tea-picking Butterfly Catching, Running Donkey, Drumming Dance, Flower Drum Lantern—to perform for four full years, and none of these programs were truly created through their own artistic labor. But they were quite satisfied with the "richness and variety" and "superb level" of their programs, and many other groups had to come to them to "learn" these programs. In this way, these few "valuable" excellent programs were constantly being "learned," "processed," and staged in a cycle.
	The people who created and performed the excellent programs, because they wanted to satisfy everyone's desire to learn, often had to put aside their normal work and specialize in teaching the same program. For example, folk artists Zhou Guobao, Zhou Guozhen, etc., in order to cope with the endless requests to learn "Running Donkey," were almost constantly on the move. They were not only unable to carry out new creations, but also delayed their legitimate labor production. In addition, some actors, because they often have to tutor all kinds of comrades who come to "learn" specially, have to give up a lot of time for learning and rest.
	This National Music and Dance Performance of Professional Troupes will inevitably produce many new and excellent dance programs. We must accept the lessons of the past; put the focus of promoting and learning excellent programs on promoting creative experience and learning performance methods. Of course, learning programs is very important. We do not object to the practice of appropriately adapting or processing programs created by others to make them more complete, but this should not be the main or only thing. What everyone participating in the learning should take back is the advanced experience and methods in creation and performance, and combine these experiences and methods with the situation and characteristics of their own group to create their own excellent programs. Everyone should not learn a set of excellent programs and perform them for several years, and then wait for the next performance to "solve" the problem. If this is the case, then what will appear after the performance will not be a vigorous creative upsurge, but a new "Three Lamps and One Donkey" prevailing across the country.

    “三灯一跑”的教训
    钟情
    全国舞蹈工作者瞩目期待的全国专业团体音乐舞蹈会演正在北京举行。每一次艺术会演必然会出现一些优秀的节目，推广和学习这些优秀的节目当然是会演中不可缺少的重要内容之一。但是，应该如何推广和学习优秀节目却是一个值得注意的问题。
    在第一届全国音乐舞蹈会演中，曾经出现了“花鼓灯”、“采茶灯”、“跑驴”等优秀的舞蹈节目，第四、五两届世界青年联欢节上又有“荷花舞”“鄂尔多斯舞”、“友谊舞”等节目获得了国际荣誉。因此在全国舞蹈界掀起了学习这些优秀节目的高潮，可是推广和学习这些节目的结果是：全国无论大小歌舞团（包括专业的和业余的）上演的节目中几乎都离不了“三灯一跑”（指“荷花灯”、“采茶灯”、“花鼓灯”、“跑驴”）。
    我国的歌舞团为数是不少的。但从上演的节目来看，却有点千篇一律。很少看到不同性质的歌舞团有它们不同的节目和独特的艺术风格。而每一个歌舞团是否能有它自己的艺术风格和特点，却是一个原则性的问题。一个喜爱看舞蹈演出的观众，也许可以在一个不长的时间内看到二十次以上的“荷花舞”和“采茶扑蝶”。而正因为这样，往往使一些原来很受观众欢迎的节目，最后使观众看得厌烦了，甚至要提出抗议。
    于是，产生了这样一种奇怪的现象：有些歌舞团长期不编排新节目，却可以经常演出；有些编导长期不创作东西，却带着“编导”的头衔。因为这些歌舞团虽然自己不创作，但可以上演别人创作的优秀节目。这些编导虽然自己不创作，但可以把别人创作的优秀节目拿来“改编”或“加工”。当然这并不是什么坏事情，可是往往有人就把别人辛勤劳动的成果冠上自己“编导”的称号。有时也会把原来很好的节目改编得不成样子。仔细想起来，这种情况是和繁荣舞蹈创作的方针相违背的。有一个中央的艺术团体就用这样一个晚会的内容——荷花舞、采茶扑蝶、跑驴、打鼓舞、花鼓灯——整整演出了四年，而其中没有一个节目是真正通过他们自己的艺术劳动创作出来的。但是他们居然以自己节目的“丰富多采”和“水平超众”感到相当满意，反过来很多团体还要向他们来“学习”这些节目。就这样，这几个“宝贵”的优秀节目就不断循环的被“学习”着、“加工”着和上演着。
    创作和演出了优秀节目的人，因为要满足大家都要求学习的愿望，常常只得丢下正常的工作不干，专门去教同一个节目。比如民间艺人周国宝、周国祯等，他们为了应付源源不绝的学习“跑驴”的要求，几乎长年在奔波中，不但不可能再去进行新的创作，并且耽误了正当的劳动生产。另外，有些演员因为经常要辅导各式各样专门来“学习”的同志，而使自己必需放弃许多学习和休息的时间。
    这一次全国专业团体音乐舞蹈会演，必然又会出现很多新的优秀舞蹈节目，我们必须很好地接受过去的经验教训；把推广和学习优秀节目的重点放在推广创作经验和学习表演方法上。当然，学习节目是非常重要的，我们并不反对把别人创作的节目经过适当的改编或加工使之更完整的做法，但这不应该是主要的、唯一的。每一个参加学习的人要带回去的，应该是在创作和表演上的先进经验和方法，把这些经验和方法结合自己团体的情况和特点来创作自己的优秀节目。不应该大家都学一套优秀节目回去演上它几年，然后再等下一次会演来“解决”问题。如果是这样的话，那么在会演之后出现的将不会是蓬蓬勃勃的创作高潮，而又会是新的“三灯一跑”通行全国。
