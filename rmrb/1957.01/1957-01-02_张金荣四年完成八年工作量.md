Zhang Jinrong Completes Eight Years' Worth of Work in Four Years

    (Our dispatch) On December 26th at 1 PM, Zhang Jinrong, an advanced producer and foundry worker at the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, fulfilled his guarantee of completing eight years' worth of work in four years ahead of schedule. He has now proposed a new guarantee to complete another two years' worth of work this year.

    Over these four years, Zhang Jinrong has put in diligent labor to complete his plan ahead of schedule. He strictly abides by labor discipline, maintaining perfect attendance every month for the past four years and never being late or leaving early. He continuously learns from others to innovate his operating techniques to improve production efficiency and ensure product quality. From 1953 to 1955, he averaged 175% of his monthly work quota. Since 1956, he has been completing over 200% of his monthly work quota. The product quality has consistently been very good, with only four defective products in four years.

    In production, Zhang Jinrong pays close attention to saving, even making efforts to utilize the slightest amounts of sand, nails, and wire. Since 1956, he has not taken any new nails longer than three inches, and he never wastes any of the large amounts of sand used in casting. He often says, "Little things add up. We must cherish every bit of capital for building socialism."

    Zhang Jinrong also proactively helps other workers improve their operating techniques. Chen Qirong, who was transferred from the steelmaking department to work in casting, was not skilled in casting operations and often failed to meet his production quota. Later, with Zhang Jinrong's patient assistance, he quickly improved his operating techniques and frequently exceeded his production quota. After some workers learned from Zhang Jinrong's operating experience, their production efficiency generally increased by more than 30%.

    张金荣四年完成八年工作量
    本报讯　12月26日下午1时，戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂先进生产者、翻砂工张金荣提前实现了四年完成八年工作量的保证。他现在又提出要在今年再完成两年工作量的新保证。
    在这四年来，张金荣为提前完成计划付出了辛勤的劳动。他严格地遵守劳动纪律，四年来月月都是全勤，从来没有迟到早退过一次。他不断地向别人学习来革新自己的操作技术，以提高生产效率和保证产品质量。从1953年到1955年的三年中，他平均每月完成工时定额175％，1956年以来，每月完成工时定额200％以上。产品质量一贯很好，四年中仅出四件废品。
    在生产中，张金荣非常注意节约，即使是点滴的砂泥、铁钉和铅丝，也都设法利用。从1956年以来，就没有领过三寸以上的新铁钉，翻砂用的大量砂泥，也总是不浪费半点。他常说：“积少成多，我们要爱惜建设社会主义的每一点资财。”
    张金荣在生产上还主动地帮助其他工人提高操作技术。由炼钢部调来做翻砂的陈其荣，对翻砂操作技术不熟练，经常达不到生产定额，后来在张金荣的耐心帮助下，很快提高了操作技术，并且经常突破生产定额。有些工人学习了张金荣的操作经验后，生产效率也普遍提高了30％以上。
