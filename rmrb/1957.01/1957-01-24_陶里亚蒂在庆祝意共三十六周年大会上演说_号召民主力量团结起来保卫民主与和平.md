Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 21st: According to TASS, Togliatti delivered a speech at a mass rally in Milan on the 20th, celebrating the 36th anniversary of the founding of the Italian Communist Party.

　　The United States' offensive against socialist countries and national liberation movements is encountering increasingly large obstacles.

　　Togliatti analyzed the current international situation. He pointed out that imperialism's attempt to stop the liberation movement of colonial peoples by launching a war against the Egyptian people did not succeed. He said that the British and French imperialists who launched the invasion of Egypt had to retreat due to the firm stance taken by the Soviet Union, the pressure of world opinion, and the contradictions among the imperialists themselves. Now their countries are filled with serious economic and political crises. American imperialists, leading the imperialist camp, are trying their best to overcome its contradictions and strengthen their ruling position, attempting to push us into a cold war. They are instigating new offensives against socialist countries, attempting to expand the scale of this offensive, so that the spearhead of this offensive is also directed at the national liberation movements of the peoples who were formerly under colonial rule. However, they are encountering increasingly large obstacles and appear weaker than before.

　　Overcoming slackness in the people's movement, defending the freedom and interests of the working people.

　　Togliatti then spoke about the domestic situation in Italy. He pointed out that the broad working people still live in poverty, the threats to democratic achievements are deepening, and the leaders of the Christian Democratic Party are attempting to strengthen the power of large monopoly capital groups and strengthen clerical power. At present, the working people universally express dissatisfaction with the status quo and demand a change in this situation. They feel and are willing to fight to defend their freedom and vital interests. Togliatti pointed out, however, that there is currently some slackness in the people's movement.

　　In analyzing the reasons for this slackness, Togliatti said: "In the past two years, when we were striving to resolve various problems facing the workers' movement and the Italian people, we used forces too much from top to bottom: trying to achieve coordination and strive for certain agreements at the top, in parliament, while at the same time, the movement that should have been carried out from bottom to top was relaxed. As a result, one of the great achievements of the Italian workers' movement in recent decades—the unity between communists and socialists—has also loosened. Some hostile ideas and viewpoints have infiltrated the ranks of the people's movement, which is due to our failure to defend the fruits of our ideology and practice with the necessary force."

　　The socialist camp is the pillar in the struggle to defend peace.

　　Togliatti then spoke about some problems within the socialist camp. He criticized those who wavered because they saw that some socialist countries admitted to making mistakes and began to correct them. In his speech, he compared some people who recently demanded to withdraw from the party to dry twigs falling from a growing tree, saying: "They will never take root, never produce sap, and never create anything new."

　　Togliatti then spoke about the Hungarian event, pointing out that the enemy used the situation created by the mistakes made in that country to eliminate all socialist achievements. In this situation, the assistance of the Soviet army was necessary and urgent. He emphasized that if this assistance had not been provided at that time, the situation would have been unimaginable.

　　Togliatti pointed out that the countries of the socialist camp are the pillar in the struggle to defend peace and ease international tension. He said that these countries "are the decisive factor in any development of the international situation. This is a new and indestructible force." He also pointed out the existence of a "camp of peoples liberated from colonial oppression."

　　Togliatti said: "We, the workers' movement in capitalist countries, are the natural ally of this new world, and this world is also our natural ally in the struggle to defend peace against imperialism."

　　It is necessary to strengthen the ranks of the party and ensure the unity of the working class.

　　The final part of Togliatti's speech concerned the question of unity of action in the Italian workers' movement and the strengthening of the ranks of the Italian Communist Party. He pointed out that the resolutions of the Eighth Congress of the Italian Communist Party concern various basic issues in Italian economic and political life, and put forward a program for the unity of action for all those who are truly willing to fight for the interests of the working masses to change the current living conditions of our country, strive to reform Italian society, and promote it to advance along the socialist road. He said that the Socialist Party's congress will be held soon, and the question of uniting the forces of the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party will be the focus of this congress's work. He emphasized that if these forces are united on the basis of the position insisted upon by the leading group of the Social Democratic Party, then the Italian workers' movement and the people's movement will not move forward, but will be a very serious regression.

　　Togliatti called for the development of a large-scale mass movement, calling on all democratic forces in the country to unite to defend the interests of the working class and the broad masses of the people, and to defend freedom and peace.

　　Togliatti finally said, "In the past, in various situations and under the most difficult conditions, we were always moving forward bravely. Now, a situation has been created in the world and in Italy that makes it possible for us to look ahead calmly. We can believe that as long as we can reform and strengthen our party, we will be able to achieve greater and better achievements than we have already achieved."

    陶里亚蒂在庆祝意共三十六周年大会上演说
    号召民主力量团结起来保卫民主与和平
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社罗马21日讯：陶里亚蒂20日在米兰举行的庆祝意大利共产党成立三十六周年的群众大会上发表了演说。
    美国对社会主义国家和民族解放运动的进攻，碰到了越来越大的障碍。
    陶里亚蒂分析了目前的国际局势。他指出，帝国主义企图依靠对埃及人民发动战争来阻止殖民地人民的解放运动，没有达到目的。他说，发动侵埃战争的英法帝国主义者，由于苏联采取强硬的立场，由于世界舆论的压力和帝国主义者自己之间的矛盾而不得不退却。现在它们国内充满了严重的经济危机和政治危机。美国帝国主义者领导着帝国主义阵营，正在竭力克服它的矛盾和加强自己的统治地位，企图把我们推向冷战。他们对社会主义国家策动新的进攻，企图扩大这一进攻的规模，使这一进攻的矛头也针对着过去处在殖民主义统治下的人民的民族解放运动。但是，他们碰到了越来越大的障碍，显得比过去更衰弱了。
    克服人民运动中的松弛现象，保卫自由和劳动人民利益。
    陶里亚蒂接着谈到了意大利国内的局势。他指出，广大的劳动人民依然过着贫困的生活，民主果实受到的威胁在日益深重，天主教民主党的领导人正企图加强大垄断资本集团的权力和加强教权。目前，劳动人民对现状普遍表示不满，并且要求改变这种状况，他们感觉到并且愿意为了保卫自己的自由和切身利益而斗争。陶里亚蒂指出，但是目前在人民运动中间还存在着某种松懈情况。
    陶里亚蒂在分析造成这种松懈情况的原因时说：“在最近两年，我们在争取解决工人运动和意大利人民面临的各种问题的时候，过多地自上而下使用了力量：试图在上边，在议会中取得协调和争取达成一定的协议，而同时，应当是自下而上开展的运动放松了。这一来，意大利工人运动近几十年来的伟大成果之一——共产党人和社会党人之间的团结也松懈了。在人民运动的队伍里渗入了某些敌对思想和观点，这是由于我们没有能够用必要的力量保卫我们思想上和实践上的果实。”
    社会主义阵营是保卫和平斗争中的支柱。
    陶里亚蒂接着谈到了社会主义阵营内部的一些问题。他批评了那些因为看到某些社会主义国家承认犯了错误并且着手改正错误而发生动摇的人。他在演说里把最近某些要求退党的人比作成长中的大树上落下来的干丫枝，他说：“它们永远不会生根、不会生出汁液、不会创造任何新的东西”。
    陶里亚蒂接着谈到匈牙利事件，他指出，敌人利用了由于这个国家所犯的错误而形成的情势，想消灭全部社会主义成果。在这种情况下，苏联军队的援助是必要的和急迫的。他强调说明如果当时不进行这种援助，局面就会不堪设想。
    陶里亚蒂指出，社会主义阵营的国家是争取保卫和平和缓和国际紧张局势的斗争的支柱。他说，这些国家“是国际局势任何发展的决定性的因素。这是新的不可摧毁的力量”。他还指出存在着一个“从殖民压迫下解放出来的各国人民的阵营”。
    陶里亚蒂说：“我们，资本主义国家的工人运动，是这一新的世界的天然同盟者，而这个世界也是我们在争取保卫和平同帝国主义斗争中的天然同盟者”。
    必须加强党的队伍，保证工人阶级的团结。
    陶里亚蒂演说的最后部分谈到关于意大利工人运动中的行动一致问题和加强意大利共产党队伍的问题。他指出意大利共产党第八次代表大会的决议涉及意大利经济和政治生活中的各种基本问题，并且替一切真正愿意为劳动群众的利益改变我国目前的生活条件而奋斗、力求革新意大利社会以及促使它沿着社会主义道路前进的人们的行动一致提出了纲领。他说，社会党的代表大会不久即将举行，团结社会党和社会民主党的力量的问题将是这次代表大会工作的中心。他着重指出，如果这些力量是以社会民主党领导集团所坚持的立场为基础团结起来的，那末，意大利的工人运动和人民运动将不会前进，而会是十分严重的倒退。
    陶里亚蒂号召发展大规模的群众运动，号召国内一切民主力量团结起来，保卫工人阶级和广大人民的利益，保卫自由与和平。
    陶里亚蒂最后说，“过去，在各种情况下，并且在最困难的条件下，我们都是勇往直前的，现在，在全世界和在意大利已经造成了使我们有可能沉着地往前看的局面，我们可以相信，只要能革新和加强我们的党，我们就能够取得比我们已经取得的更大和更好的成就”。
