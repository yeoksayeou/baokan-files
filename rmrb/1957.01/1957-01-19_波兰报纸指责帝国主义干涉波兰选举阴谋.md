Xinhua News Agency, January 18th – TASS reports that the Soviet "Pravda" published on the 15th a Warsaw dispatch exposing the "Radio Free Europe's" sabotage of the Polish elections.

    The dispatch said that recently, "Radio Free Europe" has been spreading a large number of lies and slanders against People's Poland. This is related to the current election campaign in Poland. In order to realize the intentions of its imperialist masters, "Radio Free Europe" is engaging in despicable provocative agitation against the Polish people, attempting to obstruct voters from freely expressing their will. Polish newspapers are angrily exposing these tricks of the reactionaries.

    A recent article in "People's Tribune" titled "The Wolf Throws Off the Sheep's Clothing" said that "Radio Free Europe" has shifted from a deceptive and hypocritical propaganda offensive to openly opposing the Polish United Workers' Party in recent broadcasts. "Radio Free Europe" announced its "pre-election instructions" to Poland in a broadcast on January 9th. It is not difficult to see the purpose of this provocative activity. Polish newspapers pointed out that "Radio Free Europe" is trying to ensure that the new parliament does not include people elected by the people, and that it does not include people who can lead Polish society to continue advancing along the socialist road.

    Polish newspapers say that the threads of this series of activities of "Radio Free Europe" all lead to the other side of the ocean, to the United States. "Warsaw Life" justifiably asserts that "Radio Free Europe" has close ties with the US State Department and US espionage agencies.

    波兰报纸指责帝国主义干涉波兰选举阴谋
    据新华社18日讯　据塔斯社报道，苏联“真理报”在15日刊载了关于波兰报纸揭露“自由欧洲”电台破坏波兰选举的一篇华沙通讯。
    这篇通讯说，最近一个时期，“自由欧洲”电台向人民波兰散布大量的谎言和诽谤。这是同目前波兰的选举运动有关的。“自由欧洲”电台为了实现它的帝国主义主子的意图，对波兰人民进行卑鄙的挑拨性的煽惑，企图阻挠选民自由表示他们的意志。波兰报纸正在愤怒地揭露反动派的这些诡计。
    “人民论坛报”最近发表的题为“狼扔掉了羊皮”的文章说，“自由欧洲”电台在最近的广播中已经从欺骗和假仁假义的宣传攻势转到公开反对波兰统一工人党。“自由欧洲”电台1月9日在广播中对波兰宣布了它的“选举前的指示”。不难看出这种挑衅活动的目的。波兰的报纸指出，“自由欧洲”电台力图使新议会里没有人民推选出来的人，没有能领导波兰社会沿着社会主义道路继续前进的人。
    波兰报纸说，“自由欧洲”电台这一连串活动的线索都通到大洋彼岸，通到美国。“华沙生活报”有根据地肯定，“自由欧洲”电台是同美国国务院和美国间谍机关有着密切联系的。
