Xinhua News Agency, Berlin – The “Neues Deutschland” published an article by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, on December 30th. The article discusses the foreign policy of the German Democratic Republic, the issue of German unification, and the tasks of the party.

　　Ulbricht said that replacing the "policy of strength" with a policy of peace and mutual understanding is in the interest of the West German political leadership itself. This would also be more conducive to the cause of reunifying Germany.

　　Ulbricht emphasized that the Bonn government should bear full responsibility for maintaining the divided state of Germany. It is now necessary to create conditions that make it possible for Germany to restore unification. In this regard, the German people must act in unison to oppose German militarism, and the German Social Democratic Party bears a great responsibility in this regard. However, the West German Social Democratic Party has not done any practical work to organize the struggle against West German militarism.

　　Ulbricht pointed out that the workers' parties and trade union organizations of the whole of Germany must reach an agreement. First, reconciliation between the two Germanies must be achieved, and then interim solutions in the form of an alliance or federation should be sought, and efforts should be made to restore unification and implement genuinely democratic national assembly elections as much as possible. Therefore, whoever refuses negotiations between representatives of the two Germanies is against restoring German unification.

　　Ulbricht pointed out that the German Democratic Republic does not use socialist demands as a condition for unification. The prerequisite for German unification should be: West Germany's withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the abolition of West Germany's compulsory military service law, and the removal of militarists and revanchists from leading positions in the state and the military.

　　In the last part of the article, Ulbricht discussed the further development of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. He pointed out that the Socialist Unity Party of Germany must develop in accordance with the Leninist principles of party life. This will further strengthen the party, further strengthen the cooperation of all democratic forces within the National Front of Democratic Germany, and further consolidate the worker-peasant power of the German Democratic Republic.

    乌布利希在“新德意志报”著文
    主张用和解方法恢复德国统一
    新华社柏林电　“新德意志报”在12月30日发表了德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希的一篇文章，这篇文章谈到德意志民主共和国的外交政策、德国统一问题以及党的任务。
    乌布利希说，用和平和彼此谅解的政策来代替“实力政策”，是符合西德政治领导集团自身的利益的。这样也会更有利于重新统一德国的事业。
    乌布利希着重指出，波恩政府应该对保持德国的分裂状态负完全的责任。目前必须创造条件，使德国有可能恢复统一。在这方面，德国人民必须一致行动来反对德国军国主义，而德国社会民主党对这一点有很大责任。但是，西德社会民主党并没有做任何实际工作去组织反对西德军国主义的斗争。
    乌布利希指出，整个德国的工人阶级政党和工会组织必须达成协议。首先必须达成两个德国的和解，而后找寻联盟或联邦形式的临时解决办法，并且尽可能争取恢复统一和实行真正民主的国民议会选举。因此，谁拒绝两个德国的代表进行谈判，谁就是反对恢复德国统一。
    乌布利希指出，德意志民主共和国并没有以社会主义的要求来作为统一的条件。德国统一的前提应该是：西德退出北大西洋公约组织，废除西德的义务兵役法，解除军国主义者和复仇主义者在国家和军队中的领导职务。
    乌布利希在文章的最后一部分谈到进一步发展德国统一社会党的问题。他指出，德国统一社会党必须按照党内生活的列宁主义准则发展。这将使党得到进一步加强，使一切民主力量在民主德国全国阵线里的合作得到进一步加强，使德意志民主共和国的工农政权得到进一步巩固。
