Agricultural Cooperativization Brings Tremendous Changes

Jilin's Paddy Fields Grow Rapidly - One Year Equals Eighty Years

(Our Newspaper reports) The area of paddy fields developed in Jilin Province in 1956 is almost equal to the total area developed in the past eighty years. In 1875 (the first year of the Guangxu reign), farmers in Jilin Province began planting paddy fields in areas such as Yanbian and Tonghua. After a full eighty years (until 1955), the area of paddy fields opened up was only a little over 132,000 hectares. However, after the realization of advanced cooperativization in 1956, the area of paddy fields opened up was more than 131,000 hectares. This leap forward fully demonstrates the tremendous superiority of advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives.

Now, the province's paddy field area has increased to more than 264,000 hectares, accounting for 6% of the province's grain crop area. Rice production accounts for 16.2% of the province's total grain production, while in 1949, rice production only accounted for 3.4% of grain production. Although Jilin Province suffered severe flooding last year, it still increased rice production by 300,000 tons. This year, many agricultural producers' cooperative members are eating rice for the first time. They say: If it weren't for the cooperatives, how could low-lying areas become fertile fields? Some mountain slopes that could not grow rice in the past have now become productive paddy fields. Paddy fields have high yields, some even four times higher than dry land. Baicheng Prefecture, known as the "eight hundred li of arid sea," has achieved a bumper harvest because of well-drilling to combat drought. The total grain output of Baicheng County is nearly 400 million jin, an unprecedented bumper harvest. Irrigated land in this county yields more than 1,000 jin per hectare than non-irrigated land. Before liberation, Jilin Province had almost no irrigated dry land. In 1955, irrigated dry land had developed to 10,000 hectares, while in 1956, irrigated dry land developed to 50,000 hectares. This is a major change that has occurred since the realization of agricultural cooperativization. (Zhang Cai)

    农业合作化带来了巨大的变化
    吉林水田增长快　一年可抵八十年
    本报讯　吉林省1956年发展水田的面积，几乎等于过去八十年来发展水田的总面积。1875年（光绪元年），吉林省农民开始在延边、通化等地区种水田。经过整整八十年（到1955年），开成的水田面积也不过只有十三万二千多公顷。但在1956年实现高级合作化后，开成的水田面积却有十三万一千多公顷。这种飞跃的发展，充分显示了高级农业生产合作社的巨大优越性。
    现在，这个省的水田面积已增加到二十六万四千多公顷，占全省粮食作物面积的6％。水稻产量占全省粮食产量的16.2％，而在1949年水稻产量只占粮食产量3.4％。去年吉林省虽然遭受严重水灾，但仍然增产三十万吨水稻。今年，许多农业生产合作社社员第一次吃到了大米，他们说：要不是合作社，洼地怎能变良田。一些过去不能种水稻的山坡，如今变成丰产的水田。水田的产量很高，有的甚至比旱田高四倍。号称八百里旱海的白城地区，因为打井抗旱，获得了丰收。白城县粮食总产量近四亿斤，这是从来没有过的大丰收。这个县的水浇地，每公顷要比不浇的地增产一千多斤。解放以前，吉林省几乎没有旱田水浇地，1955年旱田水浇地已发展到一万公顷，而1956年旱田水浇地却发展到五万公顷。这是实现农业合作化以后才出现的大变化。　　　　　　　　　　　　（张采）
