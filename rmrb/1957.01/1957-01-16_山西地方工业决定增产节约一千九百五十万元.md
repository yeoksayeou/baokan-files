Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, January 15th: After investigation and research, local state-owned and jointly state-private factories and mines under the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry have initially determined that, based on this year's plan, they will increase production and conserve products and materials worth 19.5 million yuan throughout the year. These units will launch a production increase and economy campaign centered on improving product quality, reducing costs, and ensuring personal and equipment safety to achieve this task. This was decided at a forum of industrial bureau chiefs and local state-owned factory directors from various cities and regions in Shanxi Province, which closed on the 14th.

The industrial bureau chiefs and factory directors who attended the forum believed that many facilities in the local state-owned industrial system of Shanxi Province still have great potential. The utilization rate of equipment in the machinery industry, food industry, and chemical industry sectors is not high. As long as some equipment is balanced in industrial sectors such as iron and steel smelting, production can also be greatly increased. In particular, many factories and mines still have a large number of discarded waste products that can be utilized. They proposed that, based on equipment capacity, raw material supply, and market sales, many products such as raw coal, gypsum, pig iron, sulfur, caustic soda, bleaching powder, oxygen, and sodium sulfide can be greatly increased in production.

The industrial bureau chiefs and factory directors who attended the forum believed that the products of local state-owned and jointly state-private industries must be "high quality and low price," and product quality must be continuously improved and costs reduced. After studying the actual situation last year, the meeting determined that each factory and mine should formulate reasonable consumption quotas, and on the premise of ensuring product quality, continuously reduce raw material consumption, reduce defective and waste products, and increase the output rate and the percentage of acceptable products. The forum also proposed that each enterprise must reduce non-production personnel and transfer the personnel streamlined from old factories to new factories or workshops put into production this year. The enterprise management expenses of each factory and mine should be reduced by 10% to 25% compared with the actual expenditure of last year; workshop expenses should be reduced by 5% to 10% based on this year's plan.

    山西地方工业决定增产节约一千九百五十万元
    新华社太原15日电　山西省工业厅所属地方国营和公私合营厂矿，经过调查研究，初步确定在今年计划的基础上，全年增产节约价值一千九百五十万元的产品和物资。这些单位将开展一个以提高产品质量、降低成本、保证人身和设备安全为中心内容的增产节约运动，来实现这项任务。这是14日闭幕的山西省各市、专区工业局长和地方国营工厂厂长座谈会上决定的。
    参加座谈会的工业局长和厂长们认为，山西省地方国营工业系统的许多设备还有很大潜力。机械工业、食品工业和化学工业部门，设备的利用率都不算高。钢铁冶炼等工业部门只要平衡一些设备，也可以大大增产。特别是许多厂矿还有大量被抛弃了的废品可以利用。他们提出，根据设备能力、原料供应、市场销路等情况，原煤、石膏、生铁、硫磺、烧碱、漂白粉、氧气，硫化碱等许多产品都可以大量增产。
    参加座谈会的工业局长、厂长们认为，地方国营、公私合营工业的产品必须“物美价廉”，必须不断提高产品质量，降低成本。在研究了去年的实际状况以后，会上确定，各厂矿要制定出合理的消耗定额，在保证产品质量的前提下，不断降低原材料消耗，减少次品废品，提高出品率和正品率。座谈会还提出各企业必须减少非生产人员，把老厂中精简的人员调到今年投入生产的新工厂或车间里去。各厂矿的企业管理费用，要比去年的实际支出节约10％到25％；车间经费要在今年计划基础上节约5％到10％。
