    Polish Middle School Girls' Basketball Team's First Match
    Polish Team Wins 71-69
    (Our Newspaper's News) The Polish women's basketball team, invited to visit China, played its first friendly match in China against the Beijing team last night at the Beijing Gymnasium. As a result of the match, the Polish team defeated the Beijing team by a score of 71 to 69.
    The entire match was very exciting. After the referee blew the whistle, the Polish team's Dombrowska scored a free throw, opening the scoring at 1-0. The Beijing team immediately took advantage of the opponent's failure to retreat in time, and captain Zhou Yixian launched a sneak attack with three passes and two deliveries, scoring a goal. By the end of the first quarter, the score was 23-21, with the Polish team leading. At the beginning of the second quarter, the Beijing team used the forward to cut into the basket, combined with the guard's accurate mid-range shots, and scored more than ten points in a row. The Polish team's Olesewicz's accurate mid-range shots and center Kabaczynska's (No. 12) turning around under the basket also made it difficult for the Beijing team to defend. At the end of the first half, the score on the field was 37-40, and the Beijing team reversed the defeat into victory.
    The last quarter of the second half was the climax of the match. The Beijing team adopted a tight man-to-man defense tactic, and the score was once tied at 61-61 and 63-63. In the last three minutes, Beijing team's main players Yang Jie and Li Shaofen were penalized for five fouls, and the Polish team's Dombrowska scored consecutively, finally winning by two points against the Beijing team.
