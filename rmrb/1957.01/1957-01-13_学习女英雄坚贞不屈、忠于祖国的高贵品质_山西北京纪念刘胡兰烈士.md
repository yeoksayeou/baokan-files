Below were placed the sacrifices offered to the martyr by relatives and representatives of the youth from all walks of life in Shanxi Province.

The memorial ceremony was held in a solemn atmosphere. More than 10,000 people observed three minutes of silence for the martyr. The band played mourning music. The chief mourner, Tang Zhenhua, Secretary of the Wenshui County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the martyr's father, Liu Jingqian, the martyr's mother, Hu Wenxiu, and more than forty accompanying mourners paid their respects in front of the coffin. Then, representatives from all walks of life and student representatives from "Liu Hulan Middle School" presented wreaths to the martyr's coffin. Liu Shouren, the county magistrate of Wenshui County, read the memorial text in front of the coffin.

Next, Tang Zhenhua, Secretary of the Wenshui County Committee of the Communist Party of China, Lun Yun, Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and representatives from all walks of life spoke at the meeting. In their speeches, they called on young people to learn from Liu Hulan's noble qualities of being unyielding and loyal to the motherland and the people.

At twelve o'clock, the young people of Yunzhou West Village carried the coffin of Martyr Liu Hulan to the Liu Hulan Martyrs' Cemetery in the sound of mourning music and buried the martyr here amidst the sound of salutes.

Xinhua News Agency, 12th. Today, more than 1,500 young people in the capital held a meeting at the Tianqiao Theater to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Martyr Liu Hulan's sacrifice.

At the beginning of the memorial meeting, all the young people in the audience stood up and observed three minutes of silence for Martyr Liu Hulan with extremely grief-stricken hearts.

Zhang Jinlin, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Youth League, said: Liu Hulan's life, as Chairman Mao said, was "A Great Life, a Glorious Death." Her noble life is worthy of our eternal remembrance and learning. We must learn her great spirit of loyalty to the people and unyielding perseverance. We must also learn her noble qualities of loving life, loving work, and being hardworking and simple. Liu Hulan is only one of the millions of revolutionary martyrs. In our decades of revolutionary struggle, countless martyrs, like Liu Hulan, shed their blood and gave their lives. We must inherit and carry forward the glorious traditions of the revolutionary martyrs. Everyone should commemorate Liu Hulan and the millions of revolutionary martyrs who inspire us to advance victoriously with practical actions of diligence, conscientiousness, hard work, and study.

Huang Shaoqui, a lieutenant colonel from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, recalled the scene of burying Martyr Liu Hulan at the memorial meeting, saying: When we and the soldiers slowly walked to the Grand Temple where Liu Hulan was sacrificed, beside the guillotine with its curled blade, the ground was covered with blood. Many soldiers knelt down, silently picked up clods of earth congealed with the hero's blood, wrapped them in towels, and placed them on their chests. Speaking here, Lieutenant Colonel Huang Shaoqui took off his glasses, wiped his tears with a handkerchief, and the whole audience was enveloped in a sorrowful atmosphere. Finally, he encouraged the young people to turn the mourning for Martyr Liu Hulan into strength and to implement her spirit into their work and study, so as to build socialism better.

After the memorial meeting, the opera "Liu Hulan" was performed by the actors of the Central Experimental Opera House.

    刘胡兰烈士陵园的对面今天用白布扎起了灵棚，灵棚里停放着刘胡兰烈士的灵柩，灵柩上复盖着中国共产党党旗。灵前挂着刘胡兰烈士的巨幅画像，还放着今天早晨才从北京赶送来的毛主席的亲笔题字：“生的伟大死的光荣”。下面摆着烈士亲属和山西省各界青年代表献给烈士的祭品。
    祭悼仪式在庄严的气氛中举行。一万多人为烈士默哀三分钟。乐队奏起哀乐。主祭人、中共文水县委员会书记唐振华，烈士的父亲刘景谦、母亲胡文秀和四十多位陪祭人陆续到灵前致哀。接着，各界代表和“刘胡兰中学”的学生代表向烈士灵前献花圈。文水县县长刘守仁在灵前宣读了祭文。
    接着，中共文水县委员会书记唐振华、中国新民主主义青年团山西省委员会书记伦云和各界代表在大会上讲话。他们在讲话中号召青年们要学习刘胡兰坚贞不屈、忠于祖国和人民的高贵品质。
    十二时，云周西村的青年们抬着刘胡兰烈士的灵柩，在哀乐声中走向刘胡兰烈士陵园，并且在礼炮声中把烈士安葬在这里。
    新华社12日讯　今天，首都一千五百多青年在天桥剧场举行纪念刘胡兰烈士牺牲十周年大会。
    在纪念会开始的时候，全场青年怀着异常悲愤的心情，起立为刘胡兰烈士静默三分钟。
    青年团北京市委员会第二书记张进霖说：刘胡兰的一生正如毛主席说的一样：“生的伟大死的光荣”。她的崇高的一生是值得我们永远怀念和学习的。我们要学习她忠于人民、坚贞不屈的伟大精神，我们还要学习她热爱生活、热爱工作、艰苦朴素的高贵品质。刘胡兰只是千百万革命烈士中的一个，在我们几十年的革命斗争里，无数的先烈和刘胡兰一样流尽了鲜血，付出了自己的生命。我们要继承和发扬革命先烈的光荣传统，每个人都应该以勤勤恳恳、兢兢业业、努力工作、努力学习的实际行动来纪念刘胡兰，来纪念鼓舞我们胜利前进的千百万的革命先烈。
    中国人民解放军某部中校黄绍奎在纪念会上回忆安葬刘胡兰烈士的情景说：当我们和战士一起慢慢走到刘胡兰牺牲的大庙前，在那卷曲了锋刃的铡刀旁边，血迹满地。很多战士跪下来，默默的拿起凝着英雄鲜血的土块，用毛巾包起来放在胸口上。讲到这里黄绍奎中校把眼镜摘下来，用手绢擦着眼泪，全场也都笼罩在悲痛的气氛中。最后他勉励青年要把哀悼刘胡兰烈士的心情变为力量，将她的精神贯彻到工作和学习中去，把社会主义建设得更好。
