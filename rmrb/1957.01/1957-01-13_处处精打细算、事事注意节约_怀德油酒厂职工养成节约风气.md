The workers of the local state-owned Huai De Oil and Liquor Factory in Jilin Province are constantly educated on the spirit of hard work and have developed a good habit of thrift. Their slogan is: "Increasing production and practicing economy should not only focus on the big picture, but also start with the small things."

In the past, when discussing increasing production and practicing economy, some people always felt that "saving every year and cutting back every year, there is no more potential to tap." In fact, the potential in this area is still great. Fu Zhenyu of the liquor making workshop researched the method of "reusing connected wooden shovels," using two or three old shovel heads that had been used before and connecting them together for reuse, replacing new wooden shovels. After this method was promoted in various groups, the annual consumption of wooden shovels was reduced by 50%, saving the country more than 2,000 yuan.

In order to improve the quality of soybean oil, the oil extraction workshop had to add a refined oil process, but it was necessary to add a set of refined oil tanks and other equipment. However, the factory had difficulties investing in this equipment. Old technician Liu Handong used several large wooden barrels and two old steaming tanks to install a simple refined oil equipment to replace the refined oil tanks. This eliminated the residue in the oil and changed the phenomena of dark soybean oil and foaming. This saved more than 5,000 yuan in investment and ensured the quality of soybean oil.

The two main workshops of the factory burn 22,400 jin of coal every day. In the past, all the coal burned was raw coal from the Liaoyuan mine. Since changing to burning Pinggang crushed coal, the factory can save more than 9,200 yuan in fuel costs per year.

In this factory, no matter which workshop or group you go to, you will see the workers' actions to eliminate a bit of waste. The workers in the qu making workshop always check the qu boxes after get off work. If there are any broken ones, they will fix them themselves. After the liquor workers finish burning the large stove, they will pick out the unburned coal and put it back into the furnace to burn again. The workers who transport soybeans also bend down to pick up a grain of soybean that falls on the ground.

In order to save various expenses, the factory also organized an expense approval committee. All the expense plans proposed by the workshops must be discussed by everyone, so that the money that should be spent is spent, and the money that should not be spent is not spent.

### 处处精打细算、事事注意节约  怀德油酒厂职工养成节约风气

    处处精打细算、事事注意节约
    怀德油酒厂职工养成节约风气
    据吉林日报讯　吉林省地方国营怀德县油酒厂，经常向职工进行艰苦奋斗的教育，在广大职工中养成了节约的良好风气。他们的口号是“增产节约不但从大处着眼，还要从小处着手”。
    早先讨论增产节约，如果讨论到降低工具消耗定额的时候，有的人总觉得“年年节约，年年削减，再也没有什么潜力可挖了。”实际上这方面的潜力仍很大。制酒车间傅振玉研究出“木锹连接再用”的方法，把以前使用过的废锹头，两个或三个接在一起再使用，代替了新木锹。各个小组推广了这个方法后，全年能降低50％的木锹耗用量，给国家节省二千多元。
    为了提高豆油质量，制油车间要增设一道精油工序，不过必须添置一套精油罐等设备。但是要投资增设这个设备，眼时工厂还有困难。老技工刘汉东便利用几个大木桶和两个旧蒸罐安装了一个简易的精油设备，代替精油罐。这就消灭了油内含有的渣滓，改变了豆油色黑、起沫等现象。既节省了五千多元的投资，还保证了豆油的质量。
    全厂两个主要车间每天要烧二万二千四百斤煤。过去烧的全是辽源矿的原煤。自改烧平岗碎煤后，一年就可以节省九千二百多元的燃料费用。
    在这个厂子，无论走到那个车间或小组，都会看到职工们消灭点滴浪费的行动。制曲车间的工人们，下班后总是先检查一下曲匣子，如果有坏的就自己钉好；酒工们烧完大灶都要把没有烧透的煤拣出来再投炉重烧；运搬大豆的工人撒到地下的一粒大豆，也要躬腰拣起来。
    为了节省各项开支，工厂里还组织了经费审批委员会，凡是各车间提出的开支计划，都要经过大家讨论，做到了应花的钱便花，不应花的钱不花。
