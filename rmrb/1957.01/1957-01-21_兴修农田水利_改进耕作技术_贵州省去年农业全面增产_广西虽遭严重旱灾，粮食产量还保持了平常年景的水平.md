Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 20th. Guizhou Province's agricultural production achieved an overall increase in 1956. The total grain output of the province reached more than 9.7 billion jin this year, an increase of more than 13% compared with 1955. The total output of the main cash crop, flue-cured tobacco, reached 960,000 dan, an increase of about 150% compared with 1955. The output of rapeseed, sugar cane, cotton, tea and other crops also increased to varying degrees. Livestock and poultry also increased, except for hogs, horses, cattle, sheep, chickens and ducks. Due to the overall increase in production, about 85% of agricultural cooperatives and members in the province increased production and income, with an average of about 650 jin of grain per farmer.

The above information was announced by Chang Song, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee at the Fifth Guizhou Provincial Model Agricultural, Forestry and Water Conservancy Workers Congress on the 15th. Chang Song said that the fundamental reason for the overall increase in production in 1956 was the realization of primary agricultural cooperation throughout the province. On this basis, farmers of all ethnic groups displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm and launched a vigorous mass production movement. Last year, the province built and renovated farmland water conservancy, expanding the irrigated area by more than 3.12 million mu, and improving the irrigated area by 570,000 mu, which played an important role in overcoming disasters, draining waterlogging and preventing floods, and turned many slopes into terraces, ensuring increased production. This year, farmers of all ethnic groups also applied 50% to 100% more fertilizer than in 1955, basically eliminating the phenomenon of no fertilization.

Due to cooperation, farmers not only have the strength to overcome various natural disasters, but also can generally improve cultivation techniques. In addition, increasing the multiple cropping index and intensive cultivation are also important factors in achieving agricultural harvests. Last year, the multiple cropping area of the province reached more than 32% of the cultivated area, an increase of nearly 50% compared with 1955.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 20th. In the first year of realizing advanced agricultural cooperation in Guangxi Province – 1956, although it suffered a severe drought unseen in forty years, the total grain output still maintained the level of a normal year, a slight increase compared with the smooth 1952 grain output. This was mentioned by Xu Lin Village, Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in a report made at the Guangxi Provincial 1956 Annual Agricultural Meteorology Model Workers Congress on the 18th.

Xu Lin Village said that according to statistics from 4,023 agricultural cooperatives in 28 counties including Rong County, Guilin Special Zone, and Yongning and Baise in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, 62.1% of the cooperatives increased production. 10.34% of the cooperatives did not increase or decrease production, and only 27.56% of the cooperatives reduced production. Most members' income increased compared with when they did not join the advanced cooperatives in 1955. Although the output of various cash crops did not complete the plan, the output of sesame, flue-cured tobacco, ramie, tea and other crops increased compared with 1955. Last year, the afforestation area in the province was more than twice the afforestation area in the six years from 1950 to 1955.

Xu Lin Village analyzed that the main reason for achieving the above achievements was the great superiority brought about by advanced agricultural cooperation. He said that last year, the area of farmland benefiting from water conservancy projects built and improved throughout the province reached more than 9 million mu, which is equivalent to seven times the area benefiting from water conservancy projects completed in 1955, enabling 4.8 million mu of single-cropping rice fields to be converted to double-cropping rice. Advanced agricultural cooperatives have achieved great success in promoting advanced cultivation techniques, new agricultural tools, improved varieties and accumulating fertilizer. In particular, since the summer harvest last year, Guangxi has not had a thorough rain for five consecutive months, and more than 17 million mu of rice and dry land crops throughout the province have been threatened by drought. However, due to the timely organization of labor by agricultural cooperatives in various places to dig wells, open canals, build dams, and intercept rivers; in order to divert water into the higher-lying fields, some watered up one or twenty levels, and the members insisted on fighting the drought day and night, so that most of the drought-stricken crops were rescued or the losses were reduced.

Xu Lin Village said that another major change brought about by advanced agricultural cooperation was the eradication of the roots of capitalism in rural areas and the prevention of polarization of farmers. He said that if a disaster as serious as last year had occurred in the past, agricultural production would have been greatly reduced, and many farmers would have gone bankrupt; now, although there are still some households in difficulty in the agricultural cooperatives, they can all get proper arrangements and care from the cooperatives.

### 兴修农田水利　改进耕作技术  贵州省去年农业全面增产  广西虽遭严重旱灾，粮食产量还保持了平常年景的水平

    兴修农田水利　改进耕作技术
    贵州省去年农业全面增产
    广西虽遭严重旱灾，粮食产量还保持了平常年景的水平
    新华社贵阳20日电　贵州省1956年的农业生产获得全面增产。这一年全省粮食总产量达到九十七亿多斤，比1955年增产13％以上。主要经济作物——烤烟，总产量达到九十六万市担，比1955年增加一倍半左右。油菜籽、甘蔗、棉花、茶叶等作物的产量，也都有不同程度的增加，牲畜和家禽，除毛猪外，马、牛、羊、鸡、鸭也有所增加。由于全面增产，全省85％左右的农业社和社员都增加了生产，增加了收入，平均每个农民有口粮六百五十斤左右。
    上述情况是中共贵州省委书记处书记常颂15日在贵州省第五届农林水利劳动模范大会上代表省委宣布的。常颂说，1956年获得全面增产的根本原因是由于全省实现了初级农业合作化。在这个基础上，各族农民发挥了高度的劳动热情，掀起了轰轰烈烈的大生产运动。去年，全省兴修和整修农田水利，共扩大灌溉面积三百一十二万多亩，改善灌溉面积五十七万亩，对战胜灾害、排涝防洪，起到了重要作用，并且使不少坡地变成梯田，保证了增产。这一年，各族农民还比1955年多施了50％到一倍的肥料，基本上消灭了不施肥的现象。
    由于合作化，农民们不仅有力量战胜各种自然灾害，而且能够普遍地改进耕作技术。此外，提高复种指数、精耕细作等，也是获得农业丰收的另一重要因素。去年全省复种面积达到耕地面积的32％多，比1955年扩大近半倍。
    新华社南宁20日电　广西省在实现高级农业合作化的第一年——1956年，虽然遭受了四十年所没见过的严重旱灾，但是粮食总产量仍然保持了平常年景的水平，比风调雨顺的1952年粮食产量还略有增加。这是中共广西省委农村工作部副部长徐麟村18日在广西省1956年度农业气象劳动模范代表大会上所作的报告中提到的。
    徐麟村说，据容县、桂林两专区和桂西僮族自治州邕宁、百色等二十八个县的四千零二十三个农业社统计，增产社占62.1％。不增不减社占10.34％，减产社只占27.56％。大部分社员收入比1955年未入高级社时增加。各种经济作物产量虽有部分没有完成计划，但芝麻、烤烟、苎麻、茶叶等产量却比1955年增加了。去年全省造林面积比自1950年到1955年中六年造林面积还多一倍多。
    徐麟村分析获得上述成绩的主要原因，是高级农业合作化带来的巨大优越性。他说，去年全省兴修和改善的水利工程，受益农田面积达九百多万亩，相当于1955年完成水利工程受益面积的七倍，使四百八十万亩单季稻田得以改种双季稻。高级农业社在推广先进耕作技术、新式农具、良种和积肥等方面都获得了巨大的成绩。特别是从去年夏收以后，广西连续五个月没有下透雨，全省有一千七百多万亩水稻和旱地作物遭受干旱威胁，但是，由于各地农业社及时地组织劳动力打井、开渠、筑坝、拦河；为了引水进入地势较高的田地，有的戽水一、二十级，社员们不分日夜坚持抗旱斗争，使受旱的农作物大部分得到挽救，或减轻了损失。
    徐麟村说，高级农业合作化带来的另一重大变化是铲除了农村滋长资本主义的根子，防止农民向两极分化。他说，如果是过去遇到像去年那样严重的灾害，农业生产将要大大减少，将会有许多农户破产；现在，虽然农业社里还有一部分困难户，但是，都能得到社里的适当安排和照顾。
