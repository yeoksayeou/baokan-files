Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch. In 1956, national water conservancy construction work achieved great development. According to information learned from the ongoing National Water Conservancy Conference, the amount of work completed in national water conservancy infrastructure construction last year was greater than in any previous year. The basic construction work volume of the first Five-Year Plan is expected to be overfulfilled. Among the above-quota projects completed and basically completed last year were the Han River Dujiatai Diversion Project and the Huai River Meishan Reservoir Sheyang Port Sluice, which is technically more complex, and the dam of the Liaoning River Dahuo房 Reservoir, which can store nearly 2 billion cubic meters of floodwater, has also been closed. At the same time, the basic preparatory work for the massive Sanmenxia Reservoir is also nearing completion. The Huai River's Mozitan and Xianghongdian Reservoirs have also begun construction. In addition to this, many medium-sized reservoirs and irrigation projects with significant benefits have been completed throughout the country.

In 1956, the country also carried out basin planning for large and medium-sized rivers and conducted a large number of river surveys with the cooperation of relevant departments. It is understood that the Huai River basin plan and the draft plans for the Hai River and Liao River basins have been basically completed, and the planning points for the Yangtze River basin are also nearing completion. The implementation of these tasks provides a reliable basis for the planned development of water conservancy and the fundamental solution of water hazards in the future.

In 1956, national farmland water conservancy construction also achieved unprecedentedly rapid development. The newly increased irrigation area due to the construction of a large number of farmland water conservancy projects nationwide reached more than 150 million mu, which is equivalent to twice the total irrigation area expanded in the seven years since the national liberation. Furthermore, it overfulfilled the planned targets set by the first Five-Year Plan by 147% one year ahead of schedule.

In 1956, the area of ​​irrigation improved and the area of ​​flood prevention and drainage (including ditches and ridges) renovated, expanded, and repaired in the country also reached 75 million mu and 87 million mu respectively, both overfulfilling the annual planned tasks. Because all regions have attached importance to the leadership of soil and water conservation work, the newly added area of ​​soil erosion control in the country last year also reached 66,000 square kilometers, exceeding the total area of ​​soil erosion control completed in the past six years.

The development of water conservancy construction in various places and the great achievements made in farmland water conservancy work have played a great role in helping people in various places to overcome the serious floods, waterlogging, and droughts last year and ensure increased agricultural production.

    1956年水利建设成就空前巨大
    对战胜洪涝旱灾、保证农业增产起了很大作用
    新华社9日讯　1956年全国水利建设工作有很大发展。据从正在进行的全国水利会议上了解，去年全国水利基本建设完成的工作量比过去任何一年都大。第一个五年计划基本的建设工作量预计可以超额完成。在去年完成和基本完成的限额以上工程中，有汉江杜家台分洪工程和技术性较高的淮河梅山水库射阳港闸等工程，能拦蓄近二十亿立方公尺洪水的辽河大伙房水库的拦河坝也已经合龙。同时，规模巨大的三门峡水库的基本准备工作也已经接近完成。淮河磨子潭、响洪甸两座水库也开始兴建。除此以外，全国各地还完成了很多效益显著的中型水库和灌溉工程。
    全国在1956年还开展了大中河流的流域规划工作。并在有关部门的配合下进行了大量的河流普查工作。据了解，淮河流域规划和海河、辽河流域规划草案已基本完成，长江流域的规划要点也接近完成。这些工作的进行，对今后有计划的开发水利和根治水害提供了可靠的根据。
    全国农田水利建设工作，在1956年也得到了空前迅速的发展。全国因兴修大量农田水利工程而新增加的灌溉面积就达一亿五千多万亩，这个数字相当于全国解放以来七年间扩大的灌溉面积总数的一倍。并且超额147％提前一年完成了第一个五年计划规定的计划指标。
    1956年全国因改建、扩建和整修旧有灌溉工程而改善的灌溉面积和防涝排水（包括沟洫畦田）面积，也分别达到七千五百万亩和八千七百多万亩，都分别超额完成了年度计划任务。由于各地重视了对水土保持工作的领导，因此去年全国新增加的水土流失的控制面积也达到六万六千平方公里，超过了以往六年中完成的水土流失的控制面积的总和。
    各地水利建设工作的发展和在农田水利工作上取得的巨大成就，对各地人民在去年战胜严重的洪、涝、旱灾害并保证农业增产，都起到了很大作用。
