    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 11th: The Syrian government issued a statement on the evening of the 10th refuting President Eisenhower's message to Congress on his Middle East policy. The statement said that the Syrian government deeply believes that maintaining peace and security in the Middle East is purely the responsibility of the people of the region.
    The statement said that Eisenhower's request to Congress to grant him the power to use American armed forces in the Middle East is serious. The statement pointed out that there is no threat of international communism to the security and independence of Syria.
    The statement said that Syria disagrees with the argument that the economic interests of any one country or several countries entitle them to interfere in the affairs of the region to safeguard these interests. It said that this argument clearly violates the principle of sovereignty, which is the foundation of the United Nations Charter.
    The statement refuted Eisenhower's assertion that there was a power vacuum in the Middle East, saying that there was no "power vacuum" in the Middle East because the countries of the Middle East had already gained their freedom and independence.
    The statement also said that the recent Anglo-French aggression against Egypt has proved that the root causes of conflicts on Arab land, and the threats of aggression that may arise in the region, come from imperialism.

    叙利亚政府驳斥“艾森豪威尔主义”
    指出叙利亚并不存在共产主义的威胁
    对阿拉伯国家的侵略都来自帝国主义
    新华社11日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚政府10日晚上发表声明，驳斥美国总统艾森豪威尔的中东政策咨文。声明说，叙利亚政府深深地相信，保持中东的和平和安全纯粹是这个地区人民的责任。
    声明说，艾森豪威尔要求国会授给他在中东使用美国武装部队的权力是严重的。声明指出，对叙利亚的安全和独立并不存在什么国际共产主义的威胁。
    这篇声明说，叙利亚不同意这样的论据：任何一个国家或者几个国家的经济利益使得它们有权干预这个地区的事务以保障这些利益。它说，这个论据显然违反了主权原则，而尊重这个原则正是联合国宪章的基础。
    这篇声明在驳斥艾森豪威尔提出的所谓中东存在势力真空的论调时说，中东地区并不存在任何“势力真空”，因为中东各国已经获得了它们的自由和独立。
    声明还说，最近英法对埃及的侵略已经证明，在阿拉伯国土上发生冲突的根源，以及对这个地区可能产生的侵略威胁，都是来自帝国主义方面的。
