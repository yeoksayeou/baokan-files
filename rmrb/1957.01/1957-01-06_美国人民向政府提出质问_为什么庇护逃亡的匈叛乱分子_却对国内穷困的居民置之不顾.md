Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 5th – According to a TASS dispatch from New York on the 4th: American newspapers have published numerous letters from readers protesting against American agencies assisting the rebels who fled Hungary and are seeking asylum and support from various American institutions, while simultaneously ignoring the plight of unemployed workers, Black people, and Native Americans within the United States.

    The "Chicago Tribune" published a letter from a resident of Millrose, Illinois. This resident expressed strong dissatisfaction that Hungarian "refugees" were immediately being offered jobs when nearly three million American workers were unemployed.

    Reader Heller, in a letter to the "New York Post," protested the warm welcome given to "fascists and Nazis" who fled Hungary in America.

    Many letter writers questioned why American government officials did not show the same concern for Black Americans as they did for the fascist rioters in Hungary. Max of Jefferson City, Missouri, wrote in a letter to the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" that thousands of Black people come from the distant South to Northern cities, these people “often without a penny to their name and without any relatives to turn to.” "But the Red Cross was not there to greet them, and in most cases, when they try to find work, they find that doors are not open to them.”

    Reader Michael's letter, published in the Chicago "Daily Defender," urged people to pay attention to the difficult situation of ordinary Americans. He said: "We have many people deserving of sympathy right before our eyes... I would like to tell our responsible politicians that the most terrible iron curtain in the world is in West Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida."

    Many readers' letters also exposed the provocative clamor stirred up around the Hungarian counter-revolutionaries who fled to the United States. One reader pointed out the hypocrisy of this propaganda offensive, writing that the United States "did not notice the incidents of bombs being thrown at the homes of Black ministers, attacks on innocent Black people on buses, and the shooting of pregnant Black women" (referring to the recent acts of violence by white terrorists in the United States).

    美国人民向政府提出质问
    为什么庇护逃亡的匈叛乱分子
    却对国内穷困的居民置之不顾
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社纽约4日消息：美国报纸刊载了许多读者来信，抗议美国机关援助从匈牙利逃亡出来、向各式各样的美国机关申请庇护和要求支持的叛乱分子，而同时却对美国国内的失业工人、黑人、印第安人的悲惨境况置之不顾。
      “芝加哥论坛报”刊载了伊利诺斯州密尔罗斯城一个居民的来信。这个居民对于在将近三百万美国工人失业的时候马上给匈牙利“难民”介绍工作这一点非常不满。
    读者海勒在给“纽约邮报”的一封信中抗议从匈牙利逃出来的“法西斯分子和纳粹分子”在美国受到欢迎。
    许多写信的人提出质问，为什么美国政府人员不像关怀匈牙利的法西斯暴乱分子那样地关怀美国黑人。密苏里州杰斐逊城的马克斯在给“圣路易邮报”的信中写道，成千上万的黑人从遥远的南方来到北方的城市，这些人“常常身上不名分文、举目无亲”。“但是红十字会并没有在那里接待他们，在大多数情况下，当他们要寻找工作的时候，他们发觉，大门并没有为他们而开”。
    读者麦克尔的登载在芝加哥的“保卫日报”的一封信中促请人们注意普通美国人的艰难处境。他说：“我们眼前有许多值得同情的人……我想告诉我国的负责政治家们，世界上最可怕的铁幕是在西拉巴马、密士失必、佛罗里达。”
    许多读者来信还揭发了在逃到美国来的匈牙利反革命分子周围所煽起的挑衅性叫嚣。一个读者指出这种宣传攻势的虚伪性质，他写道，美国并“没有注意到：向黑人牧师的住宅投掷炸弹、攻击乘公共汽车的无辜黑人、向黑人孕妇开枪这些事件”（指最近美国发生的白人恐怖分子的暴行）。
