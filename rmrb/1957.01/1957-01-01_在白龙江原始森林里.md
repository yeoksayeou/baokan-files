    In the Primeval Forest of the Bailong River
    By Our Correspondent Yan Shugui
    The Bailong River, originating at the junction of Gansu and Qinghai provinces, rushes and roars through the mountains and valleys above Wudu. Except for a short distance downstream where wooden boats and rafts can pass, the middle and upper reaches are places where even the bravest boatmen dare not venture. Going upstream along the Bailong River from Zhouqu, all there are are rugged, uneven, and difficult goat trails. Due to the difficult transportation, many ancient forests distributed in the middle and upper reaches of the Bailong River still maintain their primeval state from centuries ago. In the forest area, the shaded side of each hillside is densely lined with towering trees, forming a vast and magnificent sea of trees. From the bottom of the hillside to an altitude of about 2,700 meters, a swath of green is formed by broad-leaved forests composed of Mongolian oak, red birch, purple birch, white birch, poplar, and other trees. Further up, to an altitude of about 3,600 meters, is another swath of unchanging brownish-green, which is formed by precious coniferous forests composed of fir and spruce. The highest places are alpine plants.
    In this area, there are many mountains that no one has ever visited, and only tigers, leopards, wild oxen, bears, and wild sheep appear here. For thousands of years, the trees here have always grown naturally. No one has dared to think about comprehensively surveying this forest area, let alone comprehensively developing it. This primeval forest, which contains a large amount of precious timber, has always been a blank spot in China's forestry books.
    However, this primeval forest, which has been sleeping for thousands of years, has begun to awaken in the people's era. Since 1953, hundreds of forestry surveyors, river channel surveyors, and river channel blasting workers have poured into the forest area in large numbers, embarking on large-scale survey and exploration work, and partial river channel blasting and repair work. White tents were erected on the hillsides and on the pebble-strewn river beaches. In the primeval coniferous forest belt and in the dense thickets, the sound of loggers' axes was heard for the first time. The footprints of forestry workers were left on the steep cliffs, alpine meadows, and quicksand riverbanks, and the sweat of the workers' labor was sprinkled. "No mountain is higher than our feet!" Encouraged by this heroic spirit, they overcame numerous difficulties, marched into the primeval forest, and collected data for the future development of this forest area.
    In order to ascertain the forest area and forest reserves, forestry surveyors fought on high mountains and steep slopes all day long, traversing through thickets and deep forests. Every day before dawn, they got up to eat and prepare for work. These brave pioneers climbed over several hills, wiped their sweat, and walked into the forest. Thus began a day of forest fieldwork. Selecting spots, cutting lines, measuring distances, burying markers, drawing maps, surveying, measuring trees... a series of tasks were carried out in a busy and intense manner. At twelve o'clock noon, they took out a few cold馒头 (mantou, steamed buns), ate some pickles, drank a few mouthfuls of cold water, and continued working. Until the evening, after working all day, they dragged their tired bodies and returned to the camp, one foot high and one foot low. Among these people, many were young students who had just come out of school, or young farmers who had grown up in the countryside. They had never climbed a mountain before. When they first arrived in the forest area, they were very unaccustomed to the life. Falling, stumbling, and sliding down the mountain for a few meters in a "train ride," each person couldn't remember how many times it happened each day. Many people couldn't climb even ten meters before they were out of breath. However, these forest surveyors did not complain in the face of difficulties. They faced the difficulties and bravely trained themselves. In a short period of time, they learned the skill of grasping some branches and stepping on rocks to climb cliffs, and became accustomed to carrying dozens of kilograms of luggage and walking forty or fifty kilometers of mountain roads a day. When working on high mountains, if they were thirsty, they could cleverly find a pool of clear water under the grass, and they could easily pick many wild fruits such as strawberries, Elaeagnus pungens, and wild plums to quench their thirst. When the grain could not be supplied according to the plan, they would cross several mountains to find Tibetan families and buy a yak to slaughter and eat themselves. When their clothes and shoes were torn, they would find a few threads and sew them up themselves. Through such tenacious labor, they successively completed 700,000 hectares of forest area reconnaissance work, completed forest surveys of nearly 400,000 hectares of forest land, and many forest farm re-inspections.
    On the main stream of the Bailong River, as well as its large and small tributaries, the river channel survey team collected a large amount of data to find the future timber transport routes. People living in mountainous areas usually call some goat trails that lean against mountains and rivers "immortal roads," and mountain mouths that extend from both walls to the river surface in the air are called "gates of hell." In order to find out the riverbed slope, width, flow, flow rate, geological, topographic, and hydrological conditions, as well as the size of the blasting and repair project, river channel surveyors often had to pass through many places that people had never been to, in addition to walking through these "gates of hell" and "immortal roads" that people regard as fearsome. In the river beach area, they often had to pass through many groves of Mao bamboo, thorns, and mixed wood forests that were three, five, or ten kilometers long. Because the thorns were too dense, people could not pass through, so they wrapped their heads and upper bodies in raincoats and cotton clothes and drilled inside. When encountering quicksand riverbanks made of pebbles, sand, and soil with poor cohesion, they often lay on them and crawled forward slowly with their hands and feet. On some mountain gullies, both banks are steep stone walls, making it difficult to climb over from above. They had to grab some branches and grass roots, go down to the bottom of the gully, and then hold a stick, taking care of each other, and wade through the rapids that were deep to their abdomen. In order to rush to complete some work, they sometimes spent the night in the mountains and fields that were ten to twenty kilometers away from the camp. At night, after a day of intense work, they found a big tree to set up a fire, melted some accumulated snow to boil water, and baked some dry food as dinner. Then they draped a coat and squatted by the fire to rest. The weather was very cold in the middle of the night, and when they were woken up by the cold, they stood up and moved around, drank some boiled water, and then squatted down again. "Fire warms the chest, wind chills the back," such bivouac life continued until the next day, when it was slightly bright, and they started working again. More than 1,500 kilometers of river channel reconnaissance work and more than 600 kilometers of river channel surveying work were completed so hard.
    In the past few years, the blasting engineering team has also carried out more than 100 kilometers of river channel blasting and repair work on the Bailong River, making many dangerous waterways unobstructed navigation channels. In the process of working and experimenting, they explored many experiences in fighting against known and hidden reefs. At the beginning of the work, they only knew how to build ordinary scaffolding and blast stones near the riverbank. Later, they researched how to build continuous scaffolding, extending the scaffolding to the known reef groups scattered in the river. They also researched the method of building cantilevered scaffolding. For hard rocks and soft large solitary rocks, they also summarized the method of drilling sleeved holes and setting off heavy cannons. Under such a series of methods for overcoming reefs, large solitary rocks of several hundred cubic meters in the river, and a series of known and hidden reefs, were blasted into fragments after blasting and became navigable channels for timber.
    In recent years, thanks to the efforts of forestry workers, charts and data on the development of the Bailong River primeval forest have been drawn up. These charts and data tell people an exciting fact: the Bailong River contains 50 million cubic meters of timber, more than 90% of which are precious coniferous forests. The forest area is 700,000 hectares, which is one of the major forest areas in the country. The annual output can reach ten times that of the main forest area of Gansu Province - the Tao River Forest Area. After a large amount of mining, the timber here can be harvested for seventy or eighty years.
    Now, in the office of the Xishui Forestry Industry Bureau, they are rushing to design the forest area roads; the design work for repairing the river channels and building forest area office and employee dormitories is also being intensely organized. Next year, thousands of people will carry out large-scale basic construction in this primeval forest. Partial production can be achieved in 1958. When all of them are put into production, tens of thousands of workers will carry out logging and transportation work in this primeval forest that has been silent for generations. At that time, the sounds of axes, saws, motors, and winches will play a magnificent symphony of labor. Thousands of industrial construction timber, one after another, flow along the Bailong River to Zhaohua in Sichuan, and then transferred by the Baocheng Railway to Xi'an, Lanzhou, Xining and other places to support the economic construction of the great Northwest of the motherland.

    在白龙江原始森林里
    本报记者　燕树桂
    白龙江，这条发源于甘肃青海交界处的河流，在武都以上一直在丛山峻岭中奔驰着，咆哮着。除下游很短距离通行木船木筏外，中上游是勇敢的船夫也不敢问津的地方。从舟曲沿着白龙江向上游走去，全是崎岖不平、艰险难行的羊肠小道。由于交通艰难，分布在白龙江中上游的许多古老的森林，仍然保持着千百年来的原始状态。林区，每个山坡的阴面，都密密地排列着参天的树木，组成一幅深远、壮丽的树的海洋。从山坡底层起到海拔二千七百公尺左右的地方，一抹绿色，那是由青杠、红桦、紫桦、白桦、杨树等阔叶林组成的林带。再上去到海拔三千六百公尺左右的地方，又是常年不变的一抹褐绿色，那是由冷杉、云杉这些珍贵的针叶林组成的林带。最高的地方，是高山植物。
    这个地方，有很多山岭从来没有人到过，只有虎豹野牛老熊野羊在这里出没。千百年来，这里的树木始终在自生自长着。没有人大胆地想过要全面调查这个林区，更没有人想要全面地开发这个林区。这个蕴藏着大量珍贵木材的原始森林，在我国林业书籍中，一直是一个空白点。
    但是，这个沉睡了千百年的原始森林，在人民的年代开始苏醒了，成千上百的林业调查人员、河道测量人员，和一些河道炸石职工，从1953年开始，大量地涌进了林区，着手大规模的调查勘测工作，和部分河道的炸修工作。在山坡上，在乱石堆积的河滩上，竖立起白色的帐篷。在原始的针叶林带，在密集的灌木丛中，首次发出伐木者斧子的响声。笔直的陡壁上，高寒的草地上，流沙河岸上，留下了林业人员的足迹，洒上了职工劳动的汗水。“高山再高，没有我们的脚板子高！”他们在这种豪言壮语的激励下，克服着重重困难，向原始森林进军，为今后开发这个林区搜集资料。
    为了查明森林面积、森林储藏量，林业调查人员整天战斗在高山陡坡上，穿行在灌木丛中，穿行在密林深处。每天天不明，他们就起床吃饭，进行准备工作。这些勇敢的开拓者，爬过了几个山头，拭着汗水向林子里走去。一天的森林野外生活就这样开始了。选点，砍线，测距，埋标，绘图，调查，测树……一系列的工作都在忙碌紧张中进行着。中午十二点钟，拿出几个冷馒头，加上一些咸菜吃一下，喝几口冷开水，再继续工作。一直到傍晚，工作了一天，拖着疲倦的身体，一脚高一脚低的返回营地。在这些人当中，很多人是刚由学校里出来的青年学生，或是农村里长大的青年农民，他们从来没有爬过山，初到林区，生活很不习惯，摔倒，跌跤，从山上滑下几公尺远的“坐火车”，每个人每天都记不清发生过多少次。很多人爬不到十公尺，就累得喘不上气来。可是，这些森林调查者没有在困难面前叫苦，他们迎着困难，勇敢地锻炼着自己。在很短的时间内，他们学会了抓着一些树枝踏上岩石攀上悬崖的技巧，习惯了背上几十公斤重的行李一天走四五十公里的山路。在高山上工作时，口渴了，可以巧妙地在草底下找到一潭清水，可以顺手摘到很多像草莓、羊奶子、野李子等解渴的野果。粮食不能按计划供应时，他们会翻过几个山头找到藏民家里买来一条牦牛，自己动手杀着吃。衣服鞋袜破了，他们自己会动手找几根线头把它补起来。经过这样顽强的劳动，他们先后完成了七十万公顷的林区踏勘工作，完成了近四十万公顷林地的森林调查工作，和很多林场的复查工作。
    在白龙江主流，以及它的大小支流上，河道勘测队为寻找将来木材流送的线路，搜集到了大量的资料。住在山区的人们，通常把些倚山傍河的羊肠小道叫做“神仙路”，把从两壁伸向河面上空的山嘴子叫做“鬼门关”。河道勘测者为了查明河床坡度、宽窄、流量、流速等地质地形水文情况以及炸修工程的大小，除了要走过这些人们视为畏途的“鬼门关”、“神仙路”外，还经常要通过许多人们从来没有到过的地方。在河滩地带，他们往往要穿过很多长三、五公里、十公里不等的毛竹林、倒勾刺、马牙刺的杂木林。由于荆棘过密，人无法通过，他们就用雨衣棉衣裹着头部和上身向里面钻。遇到卵石、沙、土混合而成的胶结性很差的流沙河岸，他们常常伏在上面，用手脚慢慢向前爬行。有的山沟两岸全是陡削的石壁，很难从上面爬过去。他们只得抓住一些树枝和草根，下到沟底，然后牵着一根棍子，互相照应着，从深及腹部的急流中淌过去。为了赶着完成一些工作，他们有时露宿在离开营地十几公里到二十公里的山野上。夜晚，在一天紧张工作后，找棵大树底下架起火，化一些积雪烧开水，烤些干粮，当作晚饭用。然后就披件大衣，蹲在火堆旁休息下来。深夜天气很冷，冻醒了，他们又站起来活动一下，喝些开水，再蹲下去。“火烤胸前暖，风吹脊背寒”，这样的露宿生活一直到第二天麻麻亮，又重新开始工作。一千五百多公里的河道踏勘工作和六百多公里的河道测量工作，就是这样艰苦地完成的。
    这几年当中，炸石工程队还在白龙江进行了一百多公里长的河道炸修工程，使许多险要的水路成为畅行无阻的航道。他们在一面工作一面试验的过程中，摸索出许多跟明礁暗礁作斗争的经验。工作开始时，他们只会搭一般的脚手架，炸掉靠近河边的石头，后来研究出搭连环架，把脚手架一直搭到散堆在河流当中的明礁群上，还研究出搭悬空架的方法，对于坚硬的岩石和松软的大孤石，又总结出打套眼放重炮的方法。在这样一系列战胜礁石的方法下，河流当中，几百方的大孤石，一连串的明礁和暗礁，经过爆破以后，就纷纷炸成了碎片，变成木材可以通行的航道。
    几年来，经过森林职工的努力，有关开发白龙江原始森林的图表和资料已绘制出来，这些图表资料告诉人们一个激动人心的事实：白龙江蕴藏着五千万立方公尺的木材，90％以上是珍贵的针叶林，林区面积有七十万公顷，是全国主要林区之一。年产量可以达到甘肃省主要林区——洮河林区的十倍。大量开采以后，这里的木材，可以采伐七八十年。
    现在，在西水森林工业局的办公室里，正在赶着设计林区公路；整修河道和修建林区办公室职工宿舍的设计工作，也在紧张地整理资料中。明年将有数千人在这个原始森林里，进行大规模的基本建设。1958年即可部分生产。等到全部投入生产后，在这个世世代代以来一直保持着寂静的原始森林里，将有数以万计的工人进行采伐和流送工作，那时候，斧子、锯子、马达、绞车的声音，将会奏起雄壮的劳动交响乐。成千上万根工业建筑用材，一根接着一根顺着白龙江流到四川昭化，再由宝成路转运到西安、兰州、西宁等地，支援祖国大西北的经济建设。（附图片）
