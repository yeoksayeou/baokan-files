Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 5th: The teachers of the newly built Wuhan Institute of Geodesy and Cartography, established last summer, plan to study fifty-nine topics related to surveying and mapping this year.

    At present, the teachers have already begun some scientific research work, some of which are theoretical problems, and some are special studies to solve technical problems raised by enterprise departments.

    The teachers are also conducting scientific research in areas such as "Photogrammetry," "Stereophotogrammetry," "Practical Astronomy," and "Gravitational Measurement and Geodesy" in conjunction with compiling teaching materials. Some teachers are also conducting research on teaching methods.

    In order to facilitate scientific research for the teachers, the institute has recently opened a teacher's research room, and also plans to organize manpower to translate important works from various countries, and to collect and organize surveying and mapping works from the motherland over the past fifty years.

    武汉测量制图学院开展科学研究工作
    据新华社武汉5日电　去年暑期新建的武汉测量制图学院的教师们，今年准备研究五十九个有关测量制图方面的题目。
    目前教师们已经开始一部分科学研究工作，其中有的是理论性问题，有的是为解决企业部门所提出的技术问题的专题研究。
    教师们还结合编写教材进行“摄影测量学”、“立体摄影学”、“实用天文学”、“重力测量与地球形状学”等方面的科学研究。有的教师并且进行教学方法的研究。
    为了便于教师们进行科学研究，学院最近开辟了教师研究室，还计划组织人力翻译世界各国有关的重要论著，搜集和整理祖国五十多年来测量制图的论著。
