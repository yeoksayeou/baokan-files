Column: Responses to Criticism

    The Stone Quarried by Disaster Victims Has Been Accepted
    A letter from the Fourth Construction and Installation Engineering Company of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry: The People's Daily criticized our construction site on November 29th of last year for not accepting the stone quarried by disaster victims, which affected the disaster victims' self-salvation through production. In response, we decided to accept all the quarried stone, and it has now been processed.

    Labor Protection Work Has Been Emphasized
    A letter from the Huaibei Salt Affairs Bureau: The criticism published in the People's Daily on August 6th of last year, that there were many work-related injuries at the Huaibei Saltworks and that the leadership only inspected but did not take measures, is correct. In order to strengthen labor protection work and reverse this phenomenon, our bureau has established a Labor Protection and Welfare Section and has changed the workers' work and rest schedules according to the seasonal differences in the Huaibei salt industry.

    Vehicle Crossing Time Has Been Shortened
    A letter from the Shandong Provincial Department of Transportation: After the People's Daily published the article "Difficult to Cross the Yellow River" on October 4, 1956, we have taken the following improvement measures: (1) Automobiles and horse-drawn carts are crossed from fixed docks respectively, overcoming the chaos of vehicles crowding on one ferry crossing. (2) The Luokou Ferry Cooperative and the state-owned transportation department have been merged to increase the number of ships. The transition time has now been greatly shortened.

    The System of Differential Treatment Has Been Abolished
    A letter from the Luoyang Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering: The People's Daily criticized our bureau on August 10, 1956, for charging different rent and utility fees for cadres' family members. Our bureau has dealt with this matter and abolished the system of differential treatment for cadres of different levels (eleven levels up and down).

    Work and Rest Schedule Has Been Adjusted
    A letter from the First Engineering Division of the Northeast Third Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering: The People's Daily criticized our division on August 22, 1956, for seriously encroaching on the spare time of employees and affecting their study and rest. We have studied this matter and adjusted the original work and rest schedule.
