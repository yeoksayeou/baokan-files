The Huangshan School and Huangshan
He Tianjian

The late Ming and early Qing dynasties were the period with the most "schools" of traditional Chinese painting. There were more than ten, such as the Lou Dong, Yu Shan, Jinling, Xin'an, Wu Men, and Yun Jian schools. Among them, the Huangshan School was particularly prominent. Although the Lou Dong, Yu Shan, and Yun Jian schools also "modeled mountains and waters" and "wrestled with nature," their temperament and intent could never escape the shackles of the past. They resembled a certain school of the Ming dynasty, or a certain school of the Yuan dynasty, or even a reproduction. Although Gong Banqian used two-meter-wide splashed ink and stippling techniques to depict natural scenery, breaking away from ancient conventions, there were not many changes. All the rainy mountain scenes looked very similar on the canvas. Ultimately, they were not as lively and original as the figures of the Huangshan School.

The most famous figures of the Huangshan School are Shi Tao, Mei Qing (Qu Shan), and Jian Jiang. I will now discuss these three.

Generally speaking, Shi Tao captured the spirit of Huangshan, Mei Qing captured the shadow of Huangshan, and Jian Jiang captured the essence of Huangshan.

Huangshan is the most changeable, one moment a sea of clouds, the next a clear haze, sometimes cold, sometimes warm, encompassing all four seasons within a few days, with unpredictable sunshine and rain throughout the day. Therefore, it is a treasure trove of landscape painting materials. But to encompass all of its aspects and make them your own, one must deeply understand the object and master advanced techniques. Shi Tao was capable of this. Shi Tao's paintings, in an era when the Four Wangs school was at its peak, created a "breakthrough" (破空) composition, breaking the "three-layered" or "two-layered" structural formulas of the Four Wangs, which was truly an innovation. His techniques of applying dots, ink, and brush strokes, which broke away from ancient conventions, were all original. His saying "The law is established by myself" in the "Bitter Gourd Monk's Painting Sayings" was indeed not empty boasting. His creative spirit is rare in the history of Chinese painting art between the Ming and Qing dynasties.

Then, where did the principles and methods of Shi Tao's paintings come from? Was it from profound research into the painting theories and techniques of the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties that he achieved such accomplishments? Or was it from extensive travel, seeing many mountains, and close contact with nature that he gained such profound experience? To be honest, to make art have flesh and blood and life, both are indispensable. Merely having the former deep research without the latter experience would result in dead experience without living principles. At best, it would be making a "mummy" of the ancients, merely a "relic" of history, and could never produce a Shi Tao. Conversely, merely having the latter experience without the former research would mean that the mind and learning lack the foundation of cultivation, and the skills would also lack the ability to absorb. Shi Tao possessed both, coupled with his passionate and profound sentiments, so he achieved such artistic results. I see Shi Tao's paintings as I see Sima Qian's "Records of the Grand Historian," full of changes and unconventional. His brushwork is both integrated and scattered, his ink is both dry and moist, and his composition is "adapted to the situation" (因势得体), "breaking through the void" (破空而来). This is the extraordinary aspect of Shi Tao's art.

Some critics believe that Shi Tao's paintings were most influenced by the mid-to-late Yuan and mid-Ming styles. I say: For a great painter, his achievements naturally come from accepting the traditions he loves, but his achievements are not necessarily built upon this alone, because tradition only provides us with the experience of principles and methods, but cannot give us the creation of artistic life. To put it bluntly: Shi Tao's paintings would not have been successful if he had not gone to Huangshan. Huangshan, from the White Dragon Pool to the Heavenly Capital, Purple Cloud, Lotus Flower, West Sea, Stone Bamboo Shoots, Beginning-to-Believe Peaks, as well as many unnamed ridges and streams, waterfalls, and pine, elm, cypress, and cedar trees, if you were to say they resemble the paintings of which generation or school, then all schools from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and early Qing dynasties would be represented. The scenery encompasses everything, but each painter has his own unique understanding, mainly because the painter has profound cultivation, and can complete the painting in one breath to achieve the wonderful state of being able to do whatever he wants. The spirit of Huangshan is concretely reproduced in Shi Tao's brush, so I say that Shi Tao captured the spirit of Huangshan. However, although he had plenty of vigor, his strength was still insufficient. Looking at his large paintings, the brushstrokes were still difficult to make vigorous and firm, and the composition was sometimes slightly loose. In all that I have seen, small paintings under six feet rarely have shortcomings. Perhaps this is because I have not seen many of Shi Tao's large paintings over eight feet.

Mei Qing's paintings, although forming his own school, have major flaws. What are the flaws? His brushstrokes, his aura, and his charm all lack variation, and seem to be the same. However, his broad brushstrokes are quite powerful and imposing. Mei Qing did have his achievements. Regarding his historical tradition, some say that it originated from Wang Shuming, but this is not an appropriate judgment. Strictly speaking, Mei Qing's paintings obtained only a portion of their brushstrokes from the Yuan people, while the majority came from "learning from nature and obtaining from the heart" (外师造化、内得心源).

Mei Qing's Huangshan paintings extracted the essence and charm from the external form and momentum. His paintings seem somewhat empty on the surface, but in essence, they are highly generalized. Therefore, I say that he captured the shadow of Huangshan.

Huangshan is a thousand doors and ten thousand households, yet it is also ever-changing. If you do not have exceptional talent, you cannot hope to make everything its own. Mei Qing recognized his own talent, and he used a generalized method to "extract," which was his wisdom. He saw that Huangshan had more stone bones and less soil, so he used Huang Gongwang's "vajra pestle" (later people praised Huang's powerful brushwork and called it "vajra pestle") to express the stone texture. He saw that each rock layer had pine trees, so he used the "accumulated dot method" to create a general layout. His brushstrokes were "relaxed" with solid energy, and "scattered" with orderly warp and weft, so they could make people feel bright, comfortable, and flowing.

Mei Qing's mind was extraordinary, he could write poetry and calligraphy, and he was a learned person. I have seen his large paintings over eight feet, with brushstrokes like swimming dragons and flying phoenixes, tigers crouching and steeds galloping, dry emerging from wet, soft emerging from hard, about to sink and float, about to break and continue. They integrated a simple style and flavor, giving people a sense of solemnity and dignity, which is something that can only be achieved by a person of great courage and breadth. The origin of his cultivation cannot be said to be not from Huangshan.

The paintings of the monk Jian Jiang are the most outstanding of the Xin'an School. His brush is like steel bars, and his ink is like sea water. He often expresses the form and volume of stones in a crisscrossing manner, but it feels solemn, upright, simple, clean, and methodical, without any loss of proportion. Of course, he studied ancient methods. Originally, he was not an ordinary monk, he had literary and artistic cultivation, and of course knew Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, and Ju Ran, but only with this, Jian Jiang could not become Jian Jiang. I have seen the full map he painted for Huangshan, but I only think it does not adapt to the whole appearance of Huangshan, and the changing appearance of Huangshan cannot be expressed naturally. However, he has a solemn mood, and he is not bound by whether it "resembles" Huangshan, which is also valuable. So where did Jian Jiang's style come from? I say it still comes from Huangshan. The stone walls around Bailongtan (White Dragon Pool) and west of Zhushafeng (Cinnabar Peak) in Huangshan are the model for Jian Jiang's stone method. The flat and straight posture, majestic and open, cannot be expressed using Guan Tong's "horizontal unraveling rope texture" (横解索皴). Jian Jiang's cun (texture stroke) method is not Guan Tong's horizontal unraveling rope texture, but the horizontal unraveling rope texture of the stone wall on the White Dragon Pool in Huangshan, which is Jian Jiang's own unique horizontal unraveling rope texture method.

In general, in the analogy of drinking: Shi Tao's relationship to Huangshan is like drinking wildly from a jar; Mei Qing's relationship to Huangshan is like smelling the aroma of wine; Jian Jiang's relationship to Huangshan is like selecting the finest wine to drink. These three are all good at "learning from nature" (师造化). Those who are good at learning from nature can obtain the emotions and spirit of nature. Those who are not good at learning from nature, although striving for likeness, may lose it, and what they get is the opposite, or becomes naturalism. The ancients said, "Read ten thousand volumes of books, travel ten thousand miles of roads" (读书万卷、行路万里), which is not a pedantic saying. Reading is accepting the experience of predecessors, and traveling is using this experience to do the work of verification, to do field experience. At the same time, we must also check our own talents, our own nature, whether it is suitable, whether it can be felt, and then we can prepare for brewing in art. At the beginning, the material can be broad, and after maturity, it is required to be simple, and simple means specialization. If we learn from Jian Jiang, we must learn his emotions. If we only learn his stone method, we will inevitably become stubborn in a small world. If we learn from Mei Qing, we must learn his flavor. If we learn his format, we will inevitably be bound by his formula. If we learn from Shi Tao, we can only read his paintings as books, carefully chewing and savoring, and then we can understand the mystery and get to the bottom of his secrets. Shi Tao's paintings, in terms of what he gained from "learning from the ancients" (师古人), the achievements of the Song, Yuan, and Ming masters are all the cornerstone of his techniques; in terms of what he gained from "learning from nature," the famous mountains and rivers in the north and south have all nurtured his mind. He received so much, so whatever Huangshan has, he also has, and however Huangshan is, he can also be.

When we go to nature, we should experience more, and never paint for the sake of painting. As soon as we arrive at a famous mountain, we immediately unfold the paper and wave the pen, and after painting, we forget the object we painted. This is the most inappropriate. When I went to Huangshan this time, I got the feeling that the Huangshan School, which is famous for writing about Huangshan, each person has their own strengths. After verifying each other, I felt that comprehension and experience are a primary condition for describing nature. We must first observe from all directions, and then look at each angle in connection, and at the same time combine what we know from a certain school or person to verify it, and then describe it. I think Shi Tao and the others probably also wrote about Huangshan in this way.

    黄山派和黄山
    贺天健
    明末清初，是国画“家派”最多的时期，如娄东、虞山、金陵、新安、吴门、云间等，不下十余种，其中以黄山派尤为突出，娄东、虞山、云间等虽则也曾“范山模水”“与自然肉搏”，而其气质与意度，无论如何终不能蜕解过去的束缚，看去不像明代的某家，即像元代的某派，甚至好像是一幅复制品。龚半千虽以二米的泼墨与浑点技法来图取自然景色，一破古来樊篱，但也变化不多，所有雨山雨景，在画面上，大同小异，终不如黄山派几位来得活灵、来得新颖。
    黄山派中最著名的是石涛、梅瞿山和渐江。我现在就来谈谈这三个人。
    总的来说，石涛得黄山之灵，梅瞿山得黄山之影，渐江得黄山之质。
    黄山变幻最多，一刻为云海，一刻为晴岚，一会儿寒，一会儿暖，数日内兼有四季，一天中晴雨无常，因此幻化多端，实在是山水画材的宝库，但要概括其所有而归之于我，则非深刻体会对象和掌握高度技巧不可，石涛就是能够这样的。石涛的画　在当时四王画派极盛的时代，而以“破空”的章法，打破四王“三叠”或“两叠”的结构公式，实为一种创举。他的突破古来樊篱的点法、墨法、笔法等等，都有独创性，他在“苦瓜画语录”中所说的“法自我立”一语，的确不是空口的矜夸。他的创造精神，在我国明清间绘画艺术史上是希有的。
    然则石涛画的理法，果自何来？是钻研宋、元、明画学和画法深邃而有如此成就？还是行路多、看山多、与大自然接触密切，而有如此渊博的体验？老实说，要使艺术有血有肉有生命，实在此两者缺一不可。仅有前者的深研，而无后者的体验，则徒有死经验，而无活理法，充其极，做古人的“木乃伊”，不过是历史的“弃物”，决不能完成一个石涛。反之，仅有后者的体验而无前者的钻研，则心胸学问无此修养基础，技能方面也将无有摄取的本领。石涛则两者兼备，加上他热烈深沉的情操，艺术上才有如此的成果。我看石涛画每每当作司马迁的“史记”看，变化多端，不拘一格。用笔则整散并运，用墨则燥湿相辅，制局则“因势得体”、破空而来，这是石涛艺术的非常之处。
    有人评石涛画，以为得元代中期、末期与明代中期画风影响为最多。我说：凡一个大画家，他的成就，当然由他接受所爱的传统而来的，但未必他的成就即由此而建立起来，因为传统仅给我们以理法的经验，而不能给我们以艺术生命的创造。直截讲一句话：石涛的画，如果他不到黄山，是不会成功石涛的画的。黄山从白龙潭上直至天都、紫云、莲华、西海、石笋、始信诸峰、以及许多无名的岭阜和涧流、泉瀑、以及松榉、柏杉诸树，你如要说像哪一代哪一家的画，那就是唐、宋、元、明、清初各家俱有。景物包罗万有，而画家却各有独得，主要更在于画家深刻的修养，一气呵成，才能达到得心应手之妙。黄山灵气，在石涛笔下是具体再现了，所以我说石涛是得黄山之灵。不过，他气虽有余，力尚不足，试看他的大幅画，笔力尚难作浑劲坚结之状，章法结构有的也稍松弛，凡我所见，六尺以下的小幅就少有缺点。这或者因为我不多见石涛八尺以上的大幅之故吧。
    梅瞿山的画，虽自成一家，但是有大病的，病在什么地方？他的笔态，他的气息，他的韵格，都少变化，看去好像千篇一律。然而他的阔笔，则颇有劲、颇有势。梅氏是有他的成就的。论其历史传统，有人说是胎化自王叔明的，实则这尚非适当的论断，严格而论，梅氏的画，得自元人的，不过是笔致上的一部分，而其大体是“外师造化、内得心源”而来的。
    梅氏之于黄山，是从外形气势，取其神态与韵味，他的画在表面上像是有些虚空，但在实质上是高度的概括性的。所以我说他是得黄山之影。
    黄山是千门万户而又是千变万化的，你如果没有槃槃大才，休想尽其所有皆归于我。梅氏是认识自己的才能的，他以概括的方法去“讨取”，是他的智慧。他看见黄山石骨多、土肉少，就用黄公望的“金刚杵”（后人称赞黄氏用笔有力谓之“金刚杵”），来表现石皴。他看见每一石层都有松群，就用“攒点法”来作总的敷设。他的用笔“松快”中有结实的精力，“散乱”中有整秩的经纬，所以能使人感觉明快、恬适而流动。
    梅氏的胸襟，是不寻常的，他能诗能书，是有学养的人。我看见他八尺以上的大幅，笔如游龙翔凤、虎卧骥奔，干从湿出，柔从坚出，将沉而浮，将绝而续。融合了朴质的风格和气味，给人以严肃、端庄的感觉，是有大魄力、大气概者。他的这种修养，论其来历，不能说不是从黄山来的。
    渐江和尚的画，是新安派中最矫矫者，他笔如钢条，墨如海色，每每纵横交织地表现石的体态和体积，但觉静穆、严正、朴实、恬洁、规步矩行，一些也不放失。当然，他是学过古法的，原来他不是一个寻常的和尚，他有文学艺术修养，当然知道荆、关、董、巨，但仅是这样，渐江是不能成其为渐江的。我看见过他为黄山画的全图，只嫌他并不适应黄山的全貌，黄山变幻的神态，自然更不能表现出来，但他有一种肃穆的情致，而并不拘于是否“像”黄山，这也是可贵的。那么渐江的风格究竟从哪里来的？我说还是从黄山得来的。黄山的白龙潭上、朱砂峰西一带石壁，即是渐江石法的范本。平直的体势，雄放排空，如果用关同的“横解索皴”来表现是不得其神的。渐江的皴法，不是关同的横解索皴，而是黄山白龙潭上石壁的横解索皴，是渐江自己独有的横解索皴法。
    总的说来，譬之于饮：石涛之于黄山，有如捧坛狂饮；梅瞿山之于黄山，有如鼻嗅酒香；渐江之于黄山，则是择醇而饮。这三人都是善于“师造化”的。善师造化，所以能得造化的情与神，不善师造化，虽力求形似，但恐或失，而所得到的偏偏相反，或成了自然主义。古人说的“读书万卷、行路万里”，并不是迂腐的说法。读书就是接受前人的经验，行路就是以此经验去做质证的功夫，做实地的体验。同时也要检查自己的才具，自己的本性，能不能适合，能不能感受，而后可在艺术上作酝酿的准备。开始时，取材不妨广博，而成熟后，则要求约守，约守即专精的意思。我们如果学渐江须学他的情态，如只学他的石法，必至固执一小天地。学梅瞿山须学他的风味，如果学他的格式，也必受其公式之束缚。学石涛，则只有把他的画当书读，细细咀嚼，细细玩味，而后神会意通，能得他奥窍的地方。石涛的画，论其“师古人”所得，则宋、元、明诸大家的成就都是他技法的基石；论其“师造化”所得，则南北名山大川都曾涵养其心胸，其所受如此，故黄山有什么，他便有什么，黄山怎样，他便也能怎样了。
    我们到自然界去，应该多多体验，千万不要为画而画，一到名山，便即展纸挥笔，画成便把所画对象也忘记了，这是最不相宜的。我这次到黄山去，得到一个感觉，便是写黄山而得名的黄山派诸人，各人有各人的长处，相证之下，觉得领会和体验，是描写自然界的一个首要条件，务必先从四面八方观察一下，再从每个角度联系地看去，同时结合所知道的某家某人，以此证验，然后再描写。我看石涛诸人或许也是这样地去写黄山的。
