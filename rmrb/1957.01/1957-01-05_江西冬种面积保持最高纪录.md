Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Jiangxi Province experienced drought in the winter of 1956, but the winter planting area still reached more than 21.12 million mu, no less than 1955 – the year with the highest winter planting area in the province's history.

Currently, agricultural cooperatives in various regions are continuing to carry out weeding, topdressing, drought resistance, and frost prevention activities to protect seedlings. In some areas of the Jiujiang and Shangrao Special Zones, early-sown rapeseed, barley, and wheat have already grown to a height of five inches.

Recently, more than 4,000 winter farmland water conservancy projects have commenced throughout the province. The number of people participating in winter construction projects in Xingguo, Ruijin, Jishui and other counties accounts for approximately 30% to 50% of the total labor force in each county. In addition to continuing to build small-scale water conservancy projects, various regions have also built some reservoirs with greater irrigation capacity. The number of reservoirs capable of irrigating more than 10,000 mu of paddy fields has increased tenfold compared to 1955. On the embankments along the shores of Poyang Lake and the main rivers, more than 100,000 laborers are also working intensely to carry out annual maintenance and reinforcement of the dikes. Winter plowing, pest control, fertilizer accumulation, and other winter production activities are also underway.

    江西冬种面积保持最高纪录
    据新华社讯　江西省1956年冬季遇旱，但是冬种面积仍然达到二千一百一十二万多亩，不下于1955年——全省历史上冬种面积最高的一年。
    现在，各地农业社正在继续展开锄草、追肥、抗旱、防冻等保苗活动。九江、上饶等专区有的地方早播的油菜、大麦、小麦已经苗高五寸了。
    近来，全省有四千多座冬修农田水利工程开工。兴国、瑞金、吉水等县参加冬修工程的人数约占各县全部劳动力的30％到50％。各地除了继续兴建小型水利工程以外，还修了一些灌溉能力较大的水库。能灌溉一万亩水田以上的水库数目就比1955年增加十倍。在鄱阳湖滨和主要江河两岸的圩堤上，还有十多万劳动力在紧张地进行堤防岁修加固工作。冬耕、灭虫、积肥等冬季生产活动也正在展开。
