    Baoji Hub Station First Phase Completed

    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 16th. The first phase of the Baoji Hub Station, equipped with twelve tracks, was completed in mid-January. In addition, "connecting lines" for the Longhai Railway to enter and exit the station have been built from both ends of the station. A circular "turning line" has also been built on the west side of the station near the Jinling River, for locomotives to turn around. A communication building inside the station, equipped with the latest equipment, is having some communication machinery installed.

    The construction of this station began after the Baoji-Chengdu Railway was connected in July of last year. The mechanical road construction team completed more than 200,000 cubic meters of earthwork and laid more than 21 kilometers of track. The second phase of the hub station will continue to be constructed in the first quarter of this year.

    The Baoji Hub Station was built to meet the needs of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. It is China's first new type of railway station for both electric and steam locomotives, and it will serve as the central hub for transportation at the other four stations near Baoji. The construction steps for the station are to first build the station equipment needed for steam locomotives, to meet the current transportation needs of the Baoji-Chengdu and Baoji-Lanzhou lines. The electric interlocking signals and power catenary network within the station will continue to be built later.

    宝鸡枢纽站首期工程建成
    据新华社西安16日电　设有十二股道的宝鸡枢纽站第一期工程，1月中旬已经建成。另外，从车站两头还修通了陇海铁路进出站的“联系线”；站场西面靠金陵河畔也修好一条圆形的“回转线”，供机车转头驶用；站内一座采用最新设备的通信大楼，正在安装部分通信机械。
    这座车站的建设工程是在宝成铁路去年7月份接轨以后开始的。机械筑路队共做了二十多万土方工程，铺设了二十一公里多的轨道。今年第一季度内，枢纽站的第二期工程将要继续施工。
    宝鸡枢纽站是适应宝成铁路的需要而修建的。它是我国第一座电气和蒸汽机车两用的新型火车站，它将对宝鸡附近其他四个车站的运输起着总枢纽的作用。建站的工程步骤是先把蒸汽机车所需的站场设备建好，满足宝成、宝兰两线目前运输的需要。站内的电气闭塞信号和电力接触线网等工程，将在以后继续建设。
