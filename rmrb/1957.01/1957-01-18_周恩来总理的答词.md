Esteemed Chairman Dobi, Esteemed Premier Kádár, Comrades, Friends:

    As we set foot on the soil of the Hungarian People's Republic, we would like to first express, on behalf of the Chinese people, our warm concern and sympathy to the Hungarian people. Under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, and relying on the fraternal and sincere assistance of the Soviet Union, the Hungarian people have crushed the counter-revolutionary restoration plot and defended the socialist cause of Hungary. The Chinese people clearly understand that this plot instigated by the imperialists was aimed not only at overthrowing the people's regime in Hungary but also at establishing a forward position in Eastern Europe and breaking the unity of socialist countries, thus seriously threatening our common cause of peace and socialism. Precisely for this reason, the Chinese people regard your struggle as our own struggle and your victory as our own victory. I would like, in the name of the Chinese people, to express our highest respect to the heroic Hungarian people who are in the midst of a difficult struggle.

    On the road to building socialism, your country has encountered temporary twists and turns and difficulties. The Chinese people fully understand that your struggle to correct the serious mistakes of the past and to protect the socialist cause from the sabotage of imperialists and counter-revolutionaries is extremely arduous. However, through the recent struggles, the people's democratic forces in Hungary have undergone a major exercise. This exercise, though severe, is very beneficial. We firmly believe that the Hungarian people, under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, will surely be able to overcome the current difficulties and continue to advance the cause of socialist construction. In this regard, you can fully count on the fraternal sympathy and support of the 600 million Chinese people.

    In the recent events in Hungary, it can be clearly seen that the imperialists attempted to open a gap from Hungary, break the unity of the socialist countries, in order to achieve their conspiracy of defeating the socialist countries one by one. However, the Hungarian events have most powerfully proved that the unity and mutual assistance of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is a reliable condition for ensuring the independence and security of the socialist countries. The fraternal friendship between socialist countries, formed because of the consistency of ideological foundations and goals of struggle, cannot be destroyed by any force.

    Long live the Hungarian People's Republic!
    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples!
    Long live the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live peace and socialism!

### 周恩来总理的答词

    周恩来总理的答词敬爱的主席道比同志，敬爱的总理卡达尔同志，同志们，朋友们：
    当我们踏上匈牙利人民共和国土地的时候，我们愿意首先代表中国人民向匈牙利人民表示亲切的关怀和同情。匈牙利人民在社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的领导下，依靠苏联的兄弟般的真诚援助，粉碎了反革命复辟的阴谋，保卫了匈牙利的社会主义事业。中国人民清楚地知道，帝国主义者策动的这个阴谋，不仅抱着推翻匈牙利的人民政权的目的，也抱着在东欧建立前哨阵地和破裂社会主义国家的团结的目的，因而严重地威胁着我们共同的和平和社会主义的事业。正因为这样，中国人民把你们的斗争看成是我们自己的斗争，把你们的胜利看成是我们自己的胜利。我愿意以中国人民的名义，向正处在艰苦斗争中的英勇的匈牙利人民表示崇高的敬意。
    在建设社会主义的道路上，你们的国家遇到了暂时的曲折和困难。中国人民充分地了解，你们为纠正过去时期的严重错误、保卫社会主义事业不受帝国主义和反革命分子的破坏而进行的斗争是十分艰巨的。但是，经过最近的斗争，匈牙利的人民民主力量得到了一次重大的锻炼。这种锻炼虽是严酷的，却是非常有益的。我们坚信，匈牙利人民在社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的领导下，一定能够克服当前的困难，把社会主义建设事业继续向前推进，在这方面，你们完全可以指望六万万中国人民的兄弟的同情和支持。
    在匈牙利最近经历的事件中，可以明显地看到帝国主义者企图从匈牙利打开一个缺口，破裂社会主义各国的团结，以达到他们各个击破社会主义国家的阴谋。但是，匈牙利事件最有力地证明了以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结互助是保证社会主义国家的独立和安全的可靠条件。社会主义国家由于思想基础和奋斗目标的一致而结成的兄弟友谊，是任何力量也破坏不了的。
    匈牙利人民共和国万岁！
    中匈两国人民之间牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义国家的团结万岁！
    和平和社会主义万岁！
