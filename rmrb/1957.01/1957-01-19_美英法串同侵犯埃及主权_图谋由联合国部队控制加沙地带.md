Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 18th - Washington diplomatic sources said on the 17th that the United States, Britain and France have reached an agreement in principle advocating that the United Nations Emergency Force control the Gaza Strip and the Straits of Tiran.

These sources said that the three countries' agreement includes the following four points:

(1) UN forces will remain in the Gaza Strip until the future of the area is permanently resolved by the United Nations.

(2) The United Nations Emergency Force will control the Straits of Tiran, allowing Israeli ships to pass through the Gulf of Aqaba.

(3) Israeli forces will withdraw to the 1948 armistice line.

(4) Oppose attempts by Asian and African countries to impose sanctions on Israel.

Egypt has repeatedly stated that the task of the United Nations Emergency Force is only to guarantee and supervise the withdrawal of the British, French and Israeli troops, and should not interfere in other matters. However, it is reported that the United States is rallying the delegations of Canada, Norway and certain Latin American countries to the United Nations to discuss proposals based on these ideas.

    美英法串同侵犯埃及主权
    图谋由联合国部队控制加沙地带
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：华盛顿外交界人士17日说，美英法三国已经在原则上获得协议，主张由联合国紧急部队来控制加沙地带和蒂朗海峡。
    这些人士说，三国的协议包括以下四点：
    （一）联合国部队将留在加沙地带，直到这个地带的前途由联合国作出永久性解决为止。
    （二）联合国紧急部队将控制蒂朗海峡，使以色列的船只能通过亚喀巴湾。
    （三）以色列部队将退到1948年停战线后面。
    （四）反对亚非国家对以色列实施制裁的企图。
    埃及曾经一再声明，联合国紧急部队的任务只是保证和监督英、法、以三国军队的撤退，而不应该干预其他问题。但是，有消息说，美国正在纠合加拿大、挪威和某些拉丁美洲国家驻联合国的代表团讨论以这些想法为基础的提案。
