Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 9th. A winter production upsurge has appeared in some parts of Shanxi Province. In the rural areas of six counties including Tunliu and Lu'an in the Changzhi area, about 70% of the labor force is currently participating in winter production activities. Farmers in Changzi and Xiangyuan counties, under the slogan of "carts and horses don't stop, people don't rest," have achieved an attendance rate of 90% to 94% of the total labor force.

Shanxi Province's winter production has adopted a method of giving equal emphasis to agriculture and sideline occupations, and combining agricultural cooperative's basic construction with increased current income. In fifty-six counties including Xi County, Zuoquan, and Lu'an, and in Datong City, the newly built terraced fields, reservoirs and other soil and water conservation projects during the winter will control soil erosion over an area of more than 700,000 mu. The small-scale water conservancy projects that have been completed and are under construction throughout the province can increase the irrigated area by 523,000 mu, accounting for 34% of this year's plan. Agricultural cooperatives in sixty-two counties, including Lingchuan and Yanggao, have earned a total income of more than 17.84 million yuan through operating various sideline occupations.

At the same time, agricultural cooperatives have adopted a method of production and operation that focuses on collective production by the agricultural cooperative, supplemented by decentralized operation by individual members or production teams (groups). In addition to collective production, members of the Majiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Yanggao County have also used income from sideline production to purchase a large number of daily necessities in the past two months.

Agricultural cooperatives have also implemented measures to encourage members to invest in fertilizer. After agricultural cooperatives throughout the province abolished the system of members sharing or contributing compulsory fertilizer and adopted the method of pricing according to quality or withdrawing part of the sideline income to purchase members' fertilizer with cash, they have already accumulated more than 600 million dan of fertilizer for spring plowing.

    山西部分地区出现冬季生产高潮
    农副业并重，基本建设和增加当前收入相结合
    新华社太原9日电　山西省部分地区已经出现冬季生产高潮。长治专区的屯留、潞安等六个县农村，目前有占70％左右的劳动力参加了冬季生产活动。长子、襄垣两县农民在“车马不停、人不闲”的口号下，出勤率达到劳动力总数的90％到94％。
    山西省冬季生产采取了农业和副业并重、农业社的基本建设和增加当前收入相结合的办法。隰县、左权、潞安等五十六个县和大同市，冬季新修的梯田、蓄水池等水土保持工程，将可以控制水土流失面积七十多万亩。全省已经完成和正在兴建的小型水利工程能够增加灌溉面积五十二万三千亩，占今年计划的34％。陵川、阳高等六十二个县的农业社，由于经营各种副业，共收入了一千七百八十四万多元。
    同时，各农业社在生产经营方式上、采取了以农业社集体生产为主，以社员个人或生产队（组）分散经营为辅的办法。阳高县马家庄农业社在最近两月内除了集体生产以外，社员们还利用副业生产的收入购买了大批生活日用品。
    农业社还实行了鼓励社员投资肥料的办法。全省农业社取消了社员分摊或交义务肥料的制度、采取了按质论价或抽出部分副业收入用现金购买社员肥料的办法以后，已经为春耕需要沤积了六亿多担肥料。
