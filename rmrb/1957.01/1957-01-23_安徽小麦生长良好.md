Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 22nd. The over 42 million mu of wheat in Anhui Province are generally growing well. In the main producing area of the Huaibei Plain, the wheat seedlings are already three to five inches tall. Elderly farmers say that such good wheat is rarely seen in many years.

The main reasons for the good wheat growth in Anhui Province are that agricultural cooperatives in various places have paid attention to selecting good varieties, implementing seed disinfection treatment, and sowing in a timely manner, reducing the phenomenon of missing seedlings. The few wheat fields with missing seedlings have also been replanted in time.

The rain and snow that fell in Anhui Province in the first half of January were very beneficial to wheat growth. At present, agricultural cooperatives in various places are actively strengthening the field management of wheat. According to incomplete statistics from the Provincial Agricultural Production Office, 10,220,000 mu of wheat (including a portion of rapeseed) across the province have already been top-dressed with fertilizer once, and 2,190,000 mu have been covered with grass and ash manure to prevent frost and protect seedlings. After the rain and snow, farmers in low-lying areas along the Huai River are digging ditches to drain water, protecting the normal growth of wheat.

    安徽小麦生长良好
    新华社合肥22日电　安徽省四千二百多万亩小麦，普遍生长良好。在主要产区淮北平原，麦苗已经有三、五寸高。老年农民说，这样好的小麦是多年少见的。
    安徽省小麦长得好的原因，主要是各地农业社注意选用良种，实行种子消毒处理，适时播种，减少了缺苗现象。少数缺苗的麦田，也都及时经过了补种。
    安徽省今年1月上半月所降的雨雪，对小麦生长很有利。目前各地农业社正在积极加强小麦的田间管理工作。据省农业生产办公室的不完全统计，全省已经有一千零二十二万亩小麦（包括一部分油菜在内）追施过一次肥料，用盖草、盖灰粪等办法来防冻保苗的也有二百一十九万亩。雨雪过后，沿淮河低洼地区的农民正在挖沟排水，保护小麦正常生长。
