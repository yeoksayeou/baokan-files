Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, January 10th: According to the head of the Ministry of Forestry's Tibet Forest Survey Team, who recently returned from the forest area, Tibet has very rich forest resources. After a preliminary survey, it is estimated that the total timber reserve is approximately 100 million cubic meters. The trees in each forest area are also growing very well, with coniferous trees averaging 30 meters in height. In the Bomi forest area, some trees are as high as 62 meters and have a diameter of 1.5 meters. The forest area on the south bank of the Yarlung Tsangpo River tributaries and on both sides of the Sechila Mountain has a reserve per hectare that is even better than some forest areas in Northeast China. The survey team discovered about 30 species of trees, including several with high economic value, such as lacquer trees, spruce, fir, and *Pinus densata*.

The Ministry of Forestry's Forest Survey Team entered Tibet last April. In the past nine months, they successively surveyed the main forest areas of Bomi, Gongbu, Yadong, and others. They crossed mountains and valleys, traveling more than 3,000 kilometers. With the enthusiastic help of the Party committees at all levels and the Tibetan people, they overcame various difficulties and completed the survey task last December.

    西藏地区森林资源非常丰富
    木材总蓄积量约有一亿多立方公尺
    新华社拉萨10日电　据最近从林区回来的林业部西藏森林踏查组负责人说：西藏地区森林资源很丰富，经过踏查后初步估计，木材总蓄积量约有一亿多立方公尺。各林区树木生长的情况也很好，针叶树平均有三十公尺高。在波密林区，有的树高达六十二公尺，直径达一公尺五。雅鲁藏布江南岸各支流和色齐拉山两旁的林区，每公顷的蓄积量比东北有些林区还好。经踏查组发现的树种约有三十多种，其中有经济价值较高的漆树、云杉、冷杉、密叶赤松等多种。
    林业部森林踏查组是去年4月进藏的，九个月来，先后踏查了波密、工布、亚东等主要林区。他们翻山越岭，往返三千多公里。在中共各级党委和藏族人民热情帮助下，他们克服了各种困难，在去年12月份完成了踏查任务。
