Poland held parliamentary elections on January 20th. The parliament is the highest authority in the Polish state and is elected every four years. This election is the third parliamentary election in People's Poland.

　　The first parliamentary election in Poland after the war was held in January 1947. At that time, the Polish people's regime had been established. Under the leadership of the Polish Workers' Party and the Polish government, a series of social reforms, such as land reform and the nationalization of major enterprises, had been implemented. Although these measures were supported by the broad masses of the people, the Polish reactionaries, headed by the "Polish Peasant Party," deliberately obscured these achievements. Mikolajczyk, the reactionary ringleader of the "Polish Peasant Party," used his position as Deputy Prime Minister to collude with foreign imperialist forces and carry out various sabotage activities against the Polish Workers' Party and the Polish people's regime. On the eve of the Polish parliamentary elections in January 1947, the "Polish Peasant Party," headed by Mikolajczyk, incited voters to boycott the vote and even used terror to intimidate voters. However, thanks to the resolute struggle of the democratic forces, headed by the Polish Workers' Party, against the reactionaries, the Polish general election was able to overcome various difficulties and proceed as scheduled. On January 19, 1947, the alliance of democratic parties, headed by the Polish Workers' Party, won a glorious victory in the parliamentary elections. The reactionary ringleader Mikolajczyk and his henchmen fled abroad due to the failure of their conspiracy. The victory of the first parliamentary election was of great significance for laying the foundation of the Polish people's democratic system and the subsequent development of socialist construction.

　　Poland's second parliamentary election was held on October 26, 1952. At that time, Poland's political and economic landscape had undergone great changes. The Three-Year Plan for the restoration of the national economy had been completed, and the Six-Year Plan for building the foundations of socialism had begun in 1950. The prestige of the Polish United Workers' Party among the masses had been unprecedentedly enhanced. In this election, 95.03% of the voters participated in the voting, of which 99.8% voted in favor of the candidates of the National Front. Of the 425 seats, the Polish United Workers' Party occupied 273 seats, the United Peasant Party occupied 90 seats, the Democratic Party occupied 25 seats, and non-party members occupied 37 seats.

　　The election held on the 20th of this month is the third election of the Polish Parliament. Since this election was held after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party, it is of particular importance.

　　This parliamentary election was conducted by residents of each electoral district, with one member of parliament elected for every 60,000 people, for a total of 459 members of parliament. The Polish United Workers' Party has done a great deal of work to prepare for this election. In this election campaign, representatives of various political parties and social organizations jointly formed the Central Consultative Committee and consultative committees at all levels to jointly discuss and propose a list of candidates. Finally, it was determined that there would be 723 candidates, of which members of the Polish United Workers' Party accounted for 53%, the United Peasant Party accounted for 25%, the Democratic Party accounted for 8%, and the remaining 14% were non-party members and representatives of progressive Catholic organizations. After the nomination work was completed, the candidates met with their voters separately. Finally, the voters voted.

　　This Polish parliamentary election has the following characteristics:

　　First, the number of electoral districts has increased. In the last election, there were 67 electoral districts, and this time there are 116. The reduction in the scope of the electoral districts makes it easier for voters to understand the candidates.

　　Second, all political parties, trade unions, cooperatives, youth organizations, and other mass social organizations, whether they are central representative organs or local representative organs, have the right to nominate candidates.

　　Third, the number of people on the candidate list last time was the same as the number of members to be elected, but this time the number of candidates on the candidate list is greater than the number of members to be elected. According to the new election law, in order to enable voters to make choices among the candidates, the number of people on the candidate list exceeds the number of members to be elected. For example, if a district is to elect five members of parliament, the candidate list will have six to eight candidates.

　　Poland's anti-democratic elements have tried to influence this election. They have attempted to use all kinds of methods, such as spreading rumors, writing black letters, distributing reactionary leaflets, conducting defamation, and using hooligans to coerce voters to cross out all the names on the ballot, or cross out the names of candidates from the Polish United Workers' Party. However, their tricks were finally exposed in front of the broad masses of voters. The election results have proved that no matter how hard the reactionaries try, they cannot stop the wheels of history from moving forward.

　　The victory of the National United Front in the general election shows that the Polish people trust and support the Polish United Workers' Party, which serves the people wholeheartedly, and shows that the Polish people resolutely support socialism.

　　The Western countries' attempt to use the Polish general election to undermine Poland's socialist construction has once again been defeated. (Jing)

    波兰的三次议会选举
    1月20日，波兰举行了议会选举。议会是波兰国家的最高权力机关，每四年选举一次。这次选举已是人民波兰的第三次议会选举了。
    战后波兰的第一次议会选举是在1947年1月举行的。那时波兰人民政权已经建立。在波兰工人党和波兰政府的领导下已经实行了一系列的社会改革，如土地改革、重要企业的收归国有。虽然这些措施受到了广大人民的拥护，但是，以“波兰农民党”为首的波兰反动派却故意抹煞这些成绩。“波兰农民党”的反动头子米科拉兹柯利用当时所窃据的副总理的职位，勾结外国帝国主义势力，对波兰工人党和波兰人民政权进行各种破坏活动。1947年1月波兰议会选举前夕，以米科拉兹柯为首的“波兰农民党”煽动选民抵制投票，甚至以恐怖的手段威吓选民。但是，由于以波兰工人党为首的民主力量对反动派进行坚决的斗争，使波兰大选能够克服种种困难如期进行。1947年1月19日，议会选举的结果，以波兰工人党为首的各民主党派联盟获得了光辉的胜利。反动头子米科拉兹柯和他的党羽们因阴谋失败而逃到国外。第一次议会选举的胜利对于奠定波兰人民民主制度和以后的社会主义建设的发展具有十分重要的意义。
    波兰的第二次议会选举是在1952年10月26日举行的。当时波兰的政治和经济面貌已发生了很大变化。恢复国民经济的三年计划已经完成，并从1950年开始了建设社会主义基础的六年计划。波兰统一工人党在群众中的威望有了空前的提高。在这次选举中，有95.03％的选民参加了投票，其中99.8％都投票赞成全国阵线的候选人。在四百二十五个议席中，波兰统一工人党占二百七十三个席位，统一农民党占九十个席位，民主党占二十五个席位，无党派人士占三十七个席位。
    本月20日举行的选举是波兰议会的第三次选举。由于这次选举是在波兰统一工人党八中全会以后举行的，因此具有特别重要的意义。
    这次议会选举由各选区居民按每六万人选议员一名，共选四百五十九名议员。波兰统一工人党为筹备这次选举进行了巨大的工作。在这次选举运动中，各政党和社会团体的代表共同组成中央协商委员会和地方各级的协商委员会，共同协商提出候选人的名单。最后确定候选人为七百二十三名，其中波兰统一工人党党员占53％，统一农民党占25％，民主党占8％，其余的14％是无党派人士和进步天主教团体的代表。在提名工作结束以后，各候选人曾分别同自己的选民进行了会见。最后选民进行投票。
    这次波兰议会选举具有这样一些特点：
    第一，选区数目增多了。上一次选举，选区是六十七个，这一次是一百一十六个。选区范围的缩小便于选民了解候选人。
    第二，各政党、工会、合作社、青年组织及其他群众性社会组织，不论它们是中央代表机关或地方代表机关，都有权提出候选人。
    第三，上次候选人名单上的人数同应选的议员一样多，这次候选人名单上的候选人则多于应选出的议员数目。根据新选举法，为了使选民能够在候选人中有所选择，候选人名单上的人数超过应选议员人数。比如一个区应选五个议员，而候选名单上则有六—八个候选人。
    波兰的反民主分子曾力图影响这次选举。他们企图利用各种各样的手法，如散布流言蜚语、写黑信、散发反动传单、进行诽谤，以及利用流氓分子胁迫选民把选票上的名字全部勾掉，或者勾掉波兰统一工人党候选人的名字。但是，他们的这些勾当，终于在广大的选民面前被识破了。选举结果已证明，反动分子尽管费尽心机，但他们却不能阻止历史的车轮前进。
    全国统一阵线在大选中取得胜利，说明了波兰人民信任和拥护忠心为人民服务的波兰统一工人党，说明了波兰人民坚决拥护社会主义。
    西方国家企图利用波兰大选来破坏波兰社会主义建设的阴谋又一次遭到了失败。　　　　（竞）
