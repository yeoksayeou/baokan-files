Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: According to TASS reports: The Soviet Union is actively preparing for the local Soviet elections to be held in the first half of March, and the nomination of candidates has already begun in many cities and villages.

　　In factories and mines, construction sites and institutions, collective farms, state farms and machine tractor stations, general meetings are being held to prepare for the elections. Among the candidates nominated by the working people are industrial innovators, advanced farm members, scientists and cultural workers, and Soviet soldiers.

　　This Soviet local Soviet election will elect approximately 1.5 million representatives to the Soviets of various regions, territories, autonomous regions, cities, districts, villages, and towns. The electoral districts have been divided into approximately 1.5 million. Representatives of the working people have formed election committees in various electoral districts and administrative units. More than 950,000 election committees have been formed in the Russian Federation, with approximately 4 million people participating in the work of these committees, nearly half of whom are women, and more than three-quarters are non-Party members. Compared with the previous (February 1955) local Soviet elections, the number of electoral districts has greatly increased. In the Russian Federation alone, more than 10,000 have been added, which is the result of population growth and the establishment of new administrative centers.

　　The organizational work before the Soviet local Soviet elections is unfolding on a massive scale. Tens of thousands of well-equipped houses will serve as polling stations; propaganda stations have been established everywhere, and propagandists are explaining the election regulations; Soviet representatives are reporting to voters.

　　(Editor's Note) The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is the highest organ of state power, and the local Soviets are local organs of Soviet state power organized within regions, provinces, states, districts, cities, and villages according to administrative divisions. The term of office of local Soviets is two years. The powers of local Soviets: ① To pass resolutions and issue instructions within the scope of the powers conferred by the laws of the Soviet Union, the member republics, and the autonomous republics. ② To maintain state order within their jurisdiction, preside over local economic and cultural construction matters, stipulate local budgets, and preside over the work of subordinate administrative organs.

    苏联积极筹备地方苏维埃选举
    许多城市和乡村开始候选人提名工作
    据新华社25日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联各地正在积极准备将在3月上半月举行的地方苏维埃选举，在许多城市和乡村中已经开始了代表候选人的提名工作。
    在各工厂和矿山，建筑工地和机关，集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站，都在举行准备选举的大会。劳动人民提出的候选人中，有工业革新者，先进的农庄庄员，科学家和文化工作者，苏军战士。
    这次苏联地方苏维埃选举一共要选出各个州、边疆区、专区、市、区、村和镇的苏维埃代表一百五十万人左右。选区已经划分为约一百五十万个。劳动人民的代表组成了各地选区和行政单位的选举委员会。俄罗斯联邦的九十五万多个选举委员会已经组成，约有四百万人参加了这些委员会的工作，他们中几乎有一半是妇女，四分之三以上是非党人士。和上届（1955年2月）地方苏维埃的选举相比，选区的数目大大地增加了。仅在俄罗斯联邦就增加了一万多个，这是人口增加和新行政中心的建立的结果。
    苏联地方苏维埃选举前的组织工作正在巨大的规模上展开。数万所设备完善的房子将作为投票站；到处建立了鼓动站，鼓动员们正在解释选举条例；苏维埃代表们在向选民作报告。
    （编者注）苏联最高苏维埃是国家最高政权机关，地方苏维埃是按照行政区域的划分，在边区、省、州、区、城市及乡村内组成的苏维埃国家政权地方机关。地方苏维埃任期二年。地方苏维埃的权限：①在苏联、盟员共和国及自治共和国法律所赋予的权限以内，通过决议并颁发指令。②维持其辖区内的国家秩序，主持当地经济及文化建设事宜，规定地方预算，主持所属管理机关的工作。
