Celebrating the New Year
    Ma Tieding

    A full ten years have passed. The New Year of 1947 is one I will never forget.

    In July 1946, the enemy launched a massive offensive. To seize combat opportunities and annihilate the enemy's active forces, we withdrew north from the Suwan (Southern Jiangsu and Anhui) Liberated Area to Shandong. As we crossed the Longhai Railway, 1946 was being left behind us; a round of red sun in the east slowly rose, and the dawn of 1947 came towards us.

    We, this group of news soldiers, were all young men and women under the age of thirty, kind and good.

    Xiao Ling, twenty-six years old, already had a full beard, and was from Anhui. He originally wanted to farm and study, living a stable life. Even after he had joined the revolutionary ranks for a long time, he was still very fascinated and intoxicated by Tao Yuanming's lines, "Picking chrysanthemums by the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the Southern Mountain." One year during the New Year, he wrote a couplet himself and pasted it on the door. The couplet was: "The mountain seems to have no road in the distance, the forest depths hold another sky," with the horizontal scroll writing three particularly striking characters: "Geng Du Zhai" (Farming and Reading Studio). However, the enemy invaded their hometown, burning, killing, and looting, doing everything. His "Geng Du Zhai" was also burned to the ground, reduced to ashes. His purpose for joining the revolutionary ranks, simply put, was for revenge. There is no Great Wall separating personal vendettas and public indignation; gathering countless personal vendettas can also be sublimated into public indignation. The revenge for the destruction of "Geng Du Zhai" had long faded in Xiao Ling's memory. Now he only hoped to add a drop of his own strength and talent to the revolutionary ocean of overthrowing the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and establishing a new China.

    Xiao Pang, a sixteen-year-old girl, had a face full of childishness, as if just awakened from a sound childhood sleep. An oversized military uniform, with sleeves covering her knees. She wasn't exactly marching, but jumping forward. She ran wild all the way, often composing little tunes and gesturing to ridicule people. She should have been studying at school, but the enemy launched a war, throwing her prematurely into the melting pot of adult life.

    Xiao Zhang, from Fujian, went to Shanghai alone to escape the enemy's search and arrest. On the streets and in the alleys, for a long time, he relied on gnawing on pancakes and fried dough sticks, living a vagrant life...

    Do we, this group of people, like war? Heaven only knows. How much we long for peace! We hope to have a peaceful New Year, with the family gathered around the stove, talking intimately; we hope to see a good movie or play in the theater during the New Year; no, even if it's just a few days of undisturbed, quiet rest. But marching, fighting, fighting, marching, due to excessive fatigue, to the extent that we forgot what fatigue meant. Enemy planes circled overhead, and the rumbling of artillery fire reached our ears. The dream of peace in the New Year, at that time, was indeed, temporarily, just a dream.

    Peace is a product of both sides. Relying on wishful thinking from one side cannot bear the fruit of peace. The enemy picked up their guns and aimed them at our chests. It was clear that two paths were for us to choose: one was to reverse the era and continue to return to a life of slavery like cattle and horses, and the other was to be masters. We are good people, but not cowards. We can only take up arms to fight against the enemy who has taken up arms. We understand the division between slaves and masters; we understand the true meaning of being a real person!

    The enemy's offensive against us was prepared, with "huge" capital—millions of troops, the US imperialists' continuous assistance, and hundreds of millions of people for them to plunder and exploit. All these capitals lacked the most valuable capital, which was the hearts of the people throughout the country. The hearts of the people throughout the country were not towards the enemy, but towards the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. The direction of the people's hearts determines that our enemy must be defeated, and can also be defeated.

    Time did not disappoint us. On the marching journey during the New Year, the good news of the victory in Southern Shandong came: annihilating an enemy rapid column, and another reorganized division. The large amount of American-made weapons sent by Chiang Kai-shek's army, we counted carefully and accepted them all without error.

    We stayed overnight in a farmer's home. To celebrate the New Year and the victory in Southern Shandong, we each received a pound of pork and a pound of white flour. We had a delicious meal of dumplings. Both working and excited, we were busy all night: those who edited drafts, those who sent telegrams..., quickly spreading the news, feature stories, and communications of the victory in Southern Shandong to all parts of the country, as a New Year gift for 1947!

    The dream of peace in war is now realized. Looking back: peace really did not come easily. Looking up: the enemy of peace is not sleeping soundly!

    Peace can be won and can also be guaranteed: it depends on our vigilance! Increase vigilance a thousandfold!

    过年
    马铁丁
    已经整整的过去了十年。1947年的过年，是我永记不忘的。
    1946年7月间，敌人大举进犯。为捕捉战机，歼灭敌人有生力量，我们由苏皖解放区北撤山东。当我们跨过陇海路的时候，正是1946年抛在我们的背后；东方一轮红日，慢慢升起，1947年的黎明向我们迎面走来。
    我们这一群新闻兵，都是三十岁以下的、良善的青年小伙子和小姑娘。
    小凌，二十六岁，已经满脸胡须，安徽人。他原想一面种田，一面读书，安安稳稳地过一生。就是在他参加革命队伍好久，他对陶渊明“采菊东篱下，悠然见南山”那样的诗句，还是非常神往和陶醉。也是一年过年，他就自写了一副春联贴在门上，那春联是：“山远疑无路，林深别有天”，横披写了特别醒目的三个大字：“耕读斋”。但是，敌人侵入了他们的家乡，烧杀抢劫，无所不为。他那“耕读斋”，也付之一炬，化为灰烬。他参加革命队伍的目的，说来简单，为了复仇。私仇和公愤之间，本无万里长城之隔，集无数私仇，也可以升华为公愤。复“耕读斋”被毁之仇，在小凌的记忆中，早已退色了。现在他仅仅希望在推翻国民党反动统治，建立新中国的革命海洋中，用自己的力量和才智，加进一滴。
    小庞，一个十六岁的小姑娘，满脸稚气，仿佛刚刚从童年的酣睡中唤醒。一件肥大的军服，袖筒遮过膝盖。她简直不是在行军，而是跳跃着前进的。一路撒野，常常编个小调什么的，指手画脚地挖苦人。她理应在学校里读书，敌人发动战争，过早地把她掷入成人的生活的熔炉。
    小张，福建人，为逃避敌人的搜捕，只身走到上海。在街头上，在里弄里，很长时间，靠着啃大饼、油条，流浪过日子……
    我们这批人，都喜欢战争吗？真是天知道。我们多么希望和平呵！我们希望太太平平过个新年，火炉旁一家团聚，曲膝谈心；我们希望新年中在戏院里看个好电影或好戏；不，那怕没有惊扰的、静静的休息几天也好。但是，行军、战斗，战斗、行军，由于过分疲劳，以致忘记了什么叫做疲劳。头上敌机在盘旋，耳朵里传来隆隆的炮声。新年里的和平之梦，在那时候，确确实实，暂时地还只是一个梦。
    和平，是双方面的产物，靠我们一个方面的单相思，那是结不了和平之果的。敌人拿起枪，对准了我们的胸膛。分明两条路让我们抉择：一条是时代倒转，继续回到牛马般的奴隶生活中去，一条是做主人。我们是善良的人，可不是懦夫，对拿起武器的敌人，我们只有拿起武器来战斗。我们懂得奴隶和主人的分野；我们懂得作为一个真正的人的真谛！
    敌人向我们进攻，那是有所准备的，有“巨大”的资本的——有几百万军队，有美帝国主义者源源不断的援助，有几亿人民供其搜括和剥削。所有这些资本中却缺少一件最宝贵的资本，那就是全国人民的心。全国人民的心，不是向着敌人，而是向着共产党、向着人民解放军。人心的向背，决定我们的敌人，必须打败，也是能够打败的。
    时间没有辜负我们，在新年的行军旅途中，传来了鲁南大捷的捷报：歼灭敌人一个快速纵队，又一个整编师。经过蒋介石军送来的大量美械武器，我们如数清点，照收无误。
    夜宿农家。为庆祝新年和鲁南大捷，我们每人发到一斤猪肉、一斤白面。美美地吃了一顿饺子。是工作、也是兴奋，我们又忙了一个通宵：编稿的编稿，发报的发报……，把鲁南大捷的新闻、特写、通讯迅速地传播到全国各地去，作为1947年的新年献礼！
    在战争中和平的梦想，现在是实现了。回过头来看看：和平真是来之不易。抬起头来看看：和平的敌人，并没有酣睡！
    和平可以争取得到、也是可以保障得住的：有赖我们的警觉！千百倍地提高警觉性！
