    Jiangxi Provincial Department of Navigation Initially Streamlines
    Over a Hundred Cadres Demoted Level by Level to Strengthen Grassroots
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Jiangxi Provincial Department of Navigation, in accordance with the spirit of streamlining the upper levels and strengthening the lower levels, is carrying out a self-initiated reorganization, and has decided to streamline and demote 25% to 30% of the total number of personnel in the entire department.

    In June of last year, the Department of Navigation established a Navigation Company specifically for managing business, and the organizational structure of the various affiliated administrative bureaus was also expanded. However, the tasks undertaken remained the same as before, resulting in overlapping institutions and a surplus of personnel. Some units, which originally only needed five departments, were expanded to seven departments and one office; some people, having no work to do, could only read newspapers. The department had departments for finance, planning, and secretarial work, and the Navigation Company also had these, but in reality, the scope of work was roughly the same. Furthermore, the Navigation Company had no branch companies under it, making command ineffective and work chaotic. Some cadres in the company reflected that they had neither authority over personnel nor financial control, and were completely in a passive position. Sometimes, when issuing instructions to various bureaus, they had to rely on the department to forward them. As a result, some originally simple problems were not resolved for a long time due to layer upon layer of review and differing opinions.

    The Party group meeting of the Department of Navigation and meetings of relevant departments discussed these situations, believing that the existing organizational structure must be changed, and initially determined a plan for streamlining the institutions. Starting in mid-November, reorganization work was carried out, and more than one hundred people who were streamlined were demoted layer by layer to strengthen various production units.

    江西省航运厅初步进行精简
    百余干部逐级下放充实基层
    本报讯　江西省航运厅根据精简上层，充实下层的精神，自上而下的进行整编工作，决定精简下放人员占全厅总人数25％到30％。
    去年6月间，航运厅增设了专门管理业务的航运公司，所属各个管理局的编制也有扩大。但是所担任的任务仍然和以前一样，因而弄得机构重叠，人多事少。某些单位本来只需设五个科室，但也扩大为七个科、一个室；有些人因为无工作可做，只好翻看报纸。厅里设有财务、计划、秘书等科，航运公司也有，实际上工作范围大致是相同的。航运公司下面又没有分公司，指挥不灵，工作混乱，公司有的干部反映既无人权，又无财权，完全处在被动地位，有时发指示到各个局，又必须依靠厅去转发。这样，有些原来是很简单的问题，由于层层核转，意见不一，长期得不到解决。
    航运厅的党组会议及有关部门的会议讨论了这些情况，认为必须改变现有组织机构，初步确定了精简机构的方案。从11月中旬开始就进行了整编工作，将精简下来的一百多人，逐层下放，充实到各个生产单位去。
