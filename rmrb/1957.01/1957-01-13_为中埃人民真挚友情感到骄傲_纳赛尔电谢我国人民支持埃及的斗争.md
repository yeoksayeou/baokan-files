Xinhua News Agency, 12th – Egyptian Republic President Nasser sent the following telegram in full to Burhan, President of the Sino-Egyptian Friendship Association: Mr. Burhan, President of the Sino-Egyptian Friendship Association in Beijing:
    I am very grateful to receive your earnest congratulatory telegram. The noble sentiments expressed in this telegram, sent at the time when the aggressors withdrew from Port Said, have profoundly moved me and all the Egyptian people. The heroism displayed by the sons of the heroic city of Port Said has added immortal words to the glorious history of the Arab nations. Egypt fought this battle confident that it would prevail because right and justice were on its side. Egypt, a nation that loves freedom and peace, fully knows how to defend its dignity and maintain its sovereignty. It has thwarted the plans of the imperialists and shattered their conspiracies. The enemy has discovered that the strength of the Egyptian people and its army is not to be trifled with. The Egyptian people and its army are determined to defend their independence and are willing to contribute their lives to uphold the prestige of their motherland. The Egyptian people are very pleased and grateful for the sincere feelings expressed by the Chinese people towards Egypt during Egypt's arduous struggle. The Egyptian people are proud of the sincere relationship between our two peoples. I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to you and the members of the Association for your sincere feelings. I sincerely wish you all happiness and wish the friendly Chinese people brilliant progress and prosperity.
      Gamal Abdel Nasser

    接到你的恳切的贺电，非常感激。你在侵略者从塞得港撤退的时候拍来的这份贺电所表示的崇高的感情极其深刻地感动了我和全体埃及人民。英雄的城市塞得港的儿子们所表现的英雄主义使阿拉伯国家的光辉史册上又增加了不朽的词句。埃及进行了这一场战斗，它确信自己将要获得胜利，因为公理和正义是在它的一边的。爱好自由与和平的埃及，充分知道如何维护它的尊严和保持它的主权。它已经挫败了帝国主义者的计划，粉碎了他们的阴谋，敌人发现，埃及人民和它的军队的力量是不可轻侮的，埃及人民和它的军队坚决不移地捍卫自己的独立，并且愿意为了维护祖国的威望而贡献自己的生命。对于中国人民在埃及艰苦斗争的时候对埃及表达的诚挚的感情，埃及人民感到非常高兴和感激。埃及人民为两国人民之间的真挚的关系感到骄傲。我谨向你和协会的会员致最衷心的谢意，感谢你们这种真诚的感情。我真诚地祝你们大家万分愉快，祝友好的中国人民取得光辉的进步和繁荣。
