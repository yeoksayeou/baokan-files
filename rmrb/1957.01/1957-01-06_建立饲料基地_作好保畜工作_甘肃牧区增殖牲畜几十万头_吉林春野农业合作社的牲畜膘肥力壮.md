Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd -- 1956 was the year with the largest increase in livestock in the pastoral areas of Gansu Province since liberation. All six counties in the province that are purely pastoral areas increased their livestock last year. Among them, five counties including the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County increased their livestock by more than 268,000 head. The newly added livestock in the Sunan Yugur Autonomous County are fat and strong. Many of the horses are one to two-year-old foals. At the beginning of liberation, this autonomous county had only 70,000 head of livestock, but now it has 280,000 head.

Last year, there was sufficient rainfall in the pastoral areas of Gansu, and the pasture grew well. The livestock protection work in various pastoral areas was also better than in previous years. Several pastoral counties that did not have animal husbandry and veterinary prevention stations in the past have now been established. Livestock diseases have been treated in a timely manner, reducing deaths. Most pastoral areas have opened up larger feed bases and are trying to plant pasture. Some counties have also uniformly divided seasonal pastures and implemented planned rotational grazing. Therefore, there has been a greater increase in livestock.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, January 3rd -- The Chunye Agricultural Cooperative in Zhujia Township was recently rewarded at the Jilin Province Yongji County Advanced Animal Husbandry Producer Representative Conference. None of the more than 440 head of livestock raised by this cooperative are of the fourth-class fatness, and 90% are of the first and second-class fatness. Everyone who has visited this cooperative praises their livestock for being strong and fat.

Soon after the establishment of the Chunye Advanced Agricultural Cooperative, it studied the problems existing in the livestock breeding and management work of the original primary cooperatives. They formulated a livestock production plan, improved organizational leadership, and determined that the entire cooperative should be led by a deputy director, and each production team should be led by a deputy captain responsible for the breeding and management of livestock. They also formulated various systems for livestock feeding, work, breeding, and hygiene. In addition to holding regular meetings to study the feeding and management of livestock, the director and members also frequently go to the breeding farms for on-site inspections, and promptly solve any problems discovered. The entire cooperative also promoted the feeding and management system of fixing fatness, quantity, time, and labor for livestock. An animal loving movement was carried out between teams. Therefore, the livestock fatness of this cooperative has increased rapidly.

    建立饲料基地　作好保畜工作
    甘肃牧区增殖牲畜几十万头
    吉林春野农业合作社的牲畜膘肥力壮
    新华社3日讯　1956年是甘肃省牧区解放以来牲畜增殖最多的一年。全省有六个县是纯牧业区，去年都增加了牲畜，其中天祝藏族自治县等五个县共增殖二十六万八千多头牲畜。肃南裕固族自治县新增殖的牲畜膘满肉肥，马群中很多是一岁到两岁的马驹。这个自治县解放初期只有七万头牲畜，现在已经有二十八万头。
    去年甘肃牧区雨水充足，牧草生长得好，各牧区的保畜工作也比往年好，原来没有畜牧兽医防治站的几个牧区县，去年都已经建立起来，牲畜疾病及时得到了治疗，减少了死亡。大部分牧区开辟了较大的饲料基地，试种牧草。有的县还统一划分四季牧场，进行了有计划的轮牧。因此，牲畜增殖较多。
    新华社长春3日电　朱家乡春野农业社最近在吉林省永吉县畜牧先进生产者代表会议上受到奖励。这个合作社饲养的四百四十多头牲口没有一头是四等膘，一、二等膘的占90％。凡是到这个社去过的人，都夸奖他们饲养的牲畜膘肥力壮。
    春野高级农业社成立后不久，就针对原来各初级社牲畜饲养管理工作中存在的问题作了研究。他们订出了畜牧生产计划，健全了组织领导，确定全社由一位副主任、各生产队由一位副队长负责领导牲畜的饲养管理工作，并且订出牲畜的饲养、使役、繁殖、卫生等各项制度。社里除定期开会研究对牲畜的饲养管理以外，主任、委员还经常深入饲养所进行实地检查，发现问题及时解决，全社还推行了牲畜的定膘、定量、定时、定工等饲养管理制度，队与队之间开展了爱畜运动，因此，这个社的畜膘上升很快。
