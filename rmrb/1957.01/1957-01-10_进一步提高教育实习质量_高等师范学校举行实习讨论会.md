    Further Improve the Quality of Education Internships
    Higher Normal Schools Hold Internship Discussion Meeting
    (Our newspaper dispatch) In order to further improve the quality of education internships in higher normal education and to normalize education internships, the Higher Normal Education Department of the Ministry of Education convened a discussion meeting on education internships in higher normal schools on the 7th of this month. The meeting will discuss the tasks and content of education internships, stipulate the number and duration of education internships, the organization and leadership of education internship work, and draft an education internship outline on the basis of the discussions.
    In the past few years, many achievements have been made in education internship work, such as enabling teachers to come into contact with the actual situation of middle schools, laying the foundation for implementing the policy of linking with the actual situation of middle schools and facing middle schools in the teaching and scientific research work of higher normal schools; and through internships, there have also been great gains in cultivating and consolidating students' professional thinking and education and teaching skills. The main shortcomings in the current education internship are that the quality is not high enough, and there are shortcomings such as being divorced from reality and formalism.
    This meeting was convened on the basis of extensively soliciting opinions on education internships at zonal symposiums. On the 7th, zonal reports on the discussion situation in each zone have begun, and group discussions will be held.

    进一步提高教育实习质量
    高等师范学校举行实习讨论会
    本报讯　为了进一步提高高等师范教育实习质量和使教育实习正常化，教育部高等师范教育司在本月7日召开了高等师范学校教育实习讨论会。会议将讨论教育实习的任务和内容，规定教育实习的次数和期间，教育实习工作的组织领导，并在讨论的基础上草拟教育实习大纲。
    几年来在教育实习工作中曾取得了不少成绩，如通过实习使教师接触中学实际情况，为高等师范学校教学和科学研究工作贯彻联系中学实际、面向中学的方针奠定了基础；通过实习，在培养和巩固学生的专业思想和教育、教学的技能和技巧方面，也有很大收获。目前教育实习中的主要缺点是质量还不高，以及存在着脱离实际和形式主义等缺点。
    这次会议是在分区座谈会上广泛征求对教育实习的意见的基础上召开的。7日已开始分区汇报各区讨论情况，并将进行小组讨论。
