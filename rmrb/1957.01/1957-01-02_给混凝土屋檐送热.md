    Sending Heat to Concrete Eaves
    At a little after four o'clock in the afternoon, Zheng Yukun, an electrical technician at the Baotou Steel construction site, received a call from the company's construction section, saying that the weather had suddenly turned cold and that the concrete eaves that had already been poured on the teaching main building of the Baotou Iron and Steel Industrial School were in danger of being damaged by the frost, and a solution had to be found immediately.
    After studying the situation, Zheng Yukun felt that heating by the method of current surface conduction could solve the problem, so he instructed the foreman, Liu Changxin, to make relevant preparations for heating.
    In the evening, when the workers heard that there was an emergency task, they scrambled to participate. Electricians Liu Hengbin and Yu Fu'en and a dozen others followed Foreman Liu to carry a transformer from a place several miles away. By the time they carried the transformer to the roof, it was already after nine o'clock.
    The cold wind blew harder and harder, and the thermometer pointed to minus eighteen degrees Celsius. Zheng Yukun took a look at the higher ground, and oh no! The reinforcing steel bars were all short sections and had to be welded together to conduct electricity. But the wind was strong, and there were no welding tools, and there was no time to weld hundreds of meters of reinforcing steel bar sections. At this moment, Foreman Liu suddenly thought, "Can't we burn off some waste wire sheathing with torches and temporarily wrap and connect the reinforcing steel bars with copper wire?" Everyone thought it made sense. Jin Wanshan searched for some wire ends downstairs and took them to the stove to burn off the insulation. Fang Chenglong and Feng Hongmao set up lighting. Some people arranged the transformer, and some arranged the reinforcing steel bars. After a while, Jin Wanshan brought a batch of copper wires, beaming, and said, "The copper wires are still soft, wrap them quickly!" Zheng Yukun was afraid of danger and told everyone to wrap them several times. Then, people quickly wrapped and connected the reinforcing steel bars.
    Time passed minute by minute, and when they were about to connect the power, they encountered another problem: If they cut off the power, the power station, such a large site, would only have one person on duty; if they didn't cut it off, the power couldn't be connected. At this critical moment, Foreman Liu's worried face turned into a smile, and he said, "Okay, there's a solution. There's a power switch in the winding machine room downstairs. We can temporarily move it and think of another solution by dawn." Before he finished speaking, Wang Bingheng and Liu Hengbin had already run down to connect the power.
    The clock pointed to after twelve o'clock, and the company manager and chief engineer arrived. The manager noticed that Zheng Yukun was still wearing only a single layer of trousers and asked with concern, "Old Zheng, are you cold? Here, put on my coat." "It's okay, it's not convenient to work with it on." Zheng Yukun replied while watching the transformer. The wind was still blowing hard, as if challenging the people. Suddenly, a strong current was connected and transmitted to all parts of the eaves through the wires, and the red line on the thermometer rose in bursts. At this time, people's faces brightened, and they were sure that the quality was guaranteed. It wasn't until eight or nine o'clock the next morning that Zheng Yukun and the others left the building.

### 给混凝土屋檐送热

    给混凝土屋檐送热
    下午四点多钟，包钢工地上的电气技术员郑玉昆，接到了公司施工科的电话，说天气突然变冷，包头钢铁工业学校教学主楼上已经打好的混凝土屋檐，有被冻坏的危险，必须马上想办法解决。
    郑玉昆研究了情况以后，觉得用电流表面传导的方法加热，能够顶事，便给工长刘长信布置了有关加热的准备工作。
    傍晚，工人们听说有了紧急任务，争着要去参加。电工刘恒斌和于福恩等十几个人，一溜烟地跟刘工长到几里远的地方抬变压器去了。当他们把变压器抬到楼顶上的时候，已经九点多钟。
    寒风越刮越大，温度计指在摄氏零下十八度。郑玉昆到高处一看，呀！钢筋全是些短节，要焊接起来才能通电。可是风又大，也没有焊接工具，要焊几百公尺长的钢筋节，时间也不允许。这时，刘工长突然想起来：“我们用火把一些废电线皮烧掉，用铜丝临时缠接钢筋不行吗？”大家觉得有道理。金万山到楼下搜寻了些电线头，拿到火炉上烧去了。方成龙和冯宏茂两人架设照明电灯。有的整变压器，有的摆钢筋。一会儿，金万山搞来一批铜丝，喜孜孜地说：“铜丝还软着呢，赶快缠吧！”郑玉昆怕有危险，告诉大家多缠几圈。接着，人们飞快地缠接钢筋。
    时间一分一秒地过去，当他们要接电源的时候，又遇到了难题：停电吧，那么大的现场，动力站只有一个人值班；不停吧，接不通电源。在这紧急的关头，刘工长发愁的面孔显出了笑容，说：“好了，有办法，楼下卷扬机房内有个电闸，暂时移用，到天明再想别的办法。”话还没有落音，王秉恒和刘恒斌已经跑下去接电源去了。
    时针指在十二点以后，公司经理和主任工程师等来了。经理发现郑玉昆还穿着单裤，关切地问：“老郑，冷吧，来，把我的大衣穿上。”“不要紧，穿上它工作不方便。”郑玉昆一边回答，一边注视着变压器。风，还是一股劲地刮着，它像是和人们挑战。顿时，强大的电流接通了，通过导线，传到了屋檐的各个部分，温度计上的红线一阵阵上升。这时人们的脸色开朗了，他们确信，质量有了保证。直到第二天八、九点钟，郑玉昆等才离开了大楼。
