    A Journey of a Thousand Li
    By Our Correspondent Hu Sisheng
    “May you live a hundred years, may you live a hundred years,
    You should live long;
    Sing it again, sing it again,
    You should live long.”
    This is an old Polish song known to every household. For generations, during the most exciting and joyful moments in personal life, such as birthdays, weddings, and festivals, Polish people sing this song to express their intense emotions. However, before last year, the scope of this song was limited to small family circles, and it was not heard in public places. But, during Premier Zhou’s visit to Poland, the melody of this song repeatedly echoed in the mass rallies welcoming Chinese guests and flew in the stations welcoming and sending off Chinese guests. I will never forget that at the tea party in Łódź, Comrade Tatarkówna, the First Secretary of the local Party committee, although in her fifties and with silver threads climbing onto her hairline, still led the singing of this song with such youthful spirit and excited tone; I also cannot erase from my memory such a moving scene: in the People’s Hall in Wrocław, more than 10,000 people, standing up and down, applauded Premier Zhou and others while singing the song "May you live a hundred years." In the meeting room of the Nowa Huta factory, after the factory director led the singing of this song, Premier Zhou was obviously moved, and he repeatedly said: "I wish everyone a long life." Polish comrades repeatedly explained to me that the reason why the Polish people repeatedly sang this song was because they regarded the Chinese guests as their closest brothers.
    Since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party in October last year, all aspects of national life in Poland have been undergoing a profound transformation. This transformation is to correct the mistakes and deviations in past work. When Premier Zhou spoke at mass rallies in Warsaw, Krakow, Wrocław and other places about the Chinese people's support for the Polish people in correcting mistakes and deviations with great courage and determination under the leadership of the United Workers' Party, so as to make Poland's socialist construction advance by leaps and bounds, his speech was always drowned in cheers and applause from the masses.
    During the thousand-mile journey of the visit, the confirmed achievements of Poland's twelve years of socialist construction left an unforgettable impression on Premier Zhou Enlai and others. After visiting the two largest textile factories and other places in Łódź, the Premier had such a conversation with Samborowski, member of the Political Bureau of the Polish United Workers' Party, and Tatarkówna, the First Secretary of the local municipal Party committee.
    Premier Zhou asked: "What is the situation of higher education here?"
    Tatarkówna replied: "There was not even one university here before the war, and now there are ten universities."
    Premier Zhou asked: "Who are studying in these schools?"
    Tatarkówna said: "The vast majority are the children of workers and peasants."
    Premier Zhou asked: "What is the employment situation here?"
    Samborowski replied: "Before the war, workers could only work two or three days a week, but now there is full employment long ago. On the contrary, we now feel a shortage of labor."
    Premier Zhou praised: "That's very good."
    At this time, Premier Zhou immediately said to the surrounding Polish journalists: "The employment rate in Łódź exceeds that of Manchester in England. We should have confidence, this is the superiority of socialism. Capitalism is bound to decline, and there is nothing to envy in this system. The socialist system is like the rising sun, it will become redder and redder day by day and shine to every corner of the world. The Chinese working class believes in this, and I think the Polish working class also believes in this." Indeed, facts are the most persuasive. Those who attempt to obliterate the achievements obtained by the Polish people's blood and sweat or who cannot see these achievements are becoming fewer and fewer in Poland.
    Although the Chinese guests' visits to various places were hasty, they still tried to learn as much as possible about the new things that have occurred in Poland in the recent period and the actual life of the Polish people. In the wagon factory in Wrocław, the Premier inquired in detail about the composition, tasks and roles of the newly established workers' committee, as well as the relationship between the workers' committee and the factory director, the Party committee and the trade union. The Premier learned that the factory director was not a member of the workers' committee; in the "Defenders of Warsaw" textile factory in Łódź, which has 4,000 workers, the chairman of the workers' committee, which was established on New Year's Day this year, said to the Premier: "We cooperate with the factory's administrative leaders to do our best to complete the production plan." The Premier immediately pulled him to drink a toast with the factory's Party committee secretary, trade union chairman and factory director. The wages, material life and other issues of Polish workers were also issues of great concern to the Chinese guests. When visiting the workers' and staff residential area, the Premier asked a female primary school teacher about her salary income and expenses. The young woman said that her and her husband's salaries together were 1,700 zlotys per month, the monthly rent was 150 zlotys, and the rest of the money was basically spent on food, because meat here costs 30 zlotys per kilogram, and bread costs 3 zlotys per kilogram, and this family already has three children. In the ancient city of Krakow with a history of more than a thousand years, the Premier and others visited the largest Wawel Cathedral in the city. Like the common characteristics of general churches, the direct feeling after entering this church is deep darkness and quiet. In this religious atmosphere, two young girls knelt there praying to God. Later, it was learned that a large proportion of the population in Poland still believes in religion.
    The Chinese government delegation's visit to Poland coincided with the approaching Polish parliamentary elections. On January 20, Poland will hold national parliamentary elections. It is in line with the actual situation to say that there is a relatively complex struggle between democratic and anti-democratic forces before and during this election. At the mass rallies in various cities welcoming the Chinese Premier, the central leaders who spoke on behalf of the Polish government to welcome the Premier were all designated as candidates for parliament in this city. Polish Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz is a parliamentary candidate for the city of Krakow. He also talked about the election issue at the mass rally in Krakow welcoming Chinese guests. In Łódź, Premier Zhou asked a housewife who she would vote for. The middle-aged woman replied firmly: "My husband, my son and I are all Party members, of course we will vote for the candidates of the United Workers' Party." However, the reporter himself also heard such surprising facts that individual Party members with Party membership cards actually opposed their own Party's candidates.
    On January 15, the Chinese government delegation returned to Warsaw after visiting various parts of Poland. At the banquet held by the Chinese Embassy that evening, Premier Zhou's speech received great attention. He said that the Chinese Communist Party supports the achievements made by the Polish people under the leadership of the United Workers' Party Central Committee headed by Gomulka after the Eighth Plenary Session.
    The visit of the Chinese government delegation to Poland has come to an end. During these days, I increasingly felt that the Chinese government delegation, through extensive contact with people from all walks of life in Poland, has opened up a more solid and broad road for better mutual understanding and mutual support in the common cause.
    Premier Zhou and others left Warsaw with the deep and sincere friendship of the Polish people towards the Chinese people. (16th)

    千里行程
    本报记者　胡思升
    “长命百岁，长命百岁，
    你应该长寿；
    再唱一次，再唱一次，
    你应该长寿。”
    这是一首波兰家喻户晓的古老歌曲，世世代代以来，在寿辰、婚礼、节日等个人生活中令人最兴奋愉快的时刻，波兰人就唱这首歌来表达自己感情激动的内心世界。但是，在去年以前，这首歌词唱的范围只限于家庭的小圈子内，在大庭广众的场所是听不到的。可是，这一次在周总理访问波兰的期间，这首歌的旋律一再地荡漾在群众欢迎中国客人的集会上、飞舞在迎送中国客人的车站上。我永远难忘，在罗兹的茶会上，该地党委第一书记塔塔科夫纳同志，虽然年已半百，银丝已爬上她的发际，她还是以那样青年的神态和激动的声调引声高唱这首歌；我也不能从记忆中抹去这样动人心弦的场面，在弗罗茨瓦夫的人民大厅内，前后上下一万多人起立向周总理等人，一面鼓掌，一面唱“长命百岁”这首歌曲。在诺瓦—胡塔工厂的会议室内，当厂长领头唱完这首歌后，显然周总理也感动了，他连续地说：“祝大家长命百岁”。波兰同志一再地向我解释，波兰人民所以一再地唱这首歌，是因为他们把中国客人看作最亲的兄弟。
    自从去年十月波兰统一工人党八中全会以来，在波兰国家生活的各个方面经历着一个深刻的转变。通过这个转变来改正过去工作中的错误和偏差。当周总理在华沙、克拉科夫、弗罗茨瓦夫等地的群众集会上讲到中国人民支持波兰人民在统一工人党的领导下以巨大的勇气和决心改正错误和偏差从而将使波兰的社会主义建设更大踏步前进的时候，他的讲话每次都被群众的欢呼声和掌声所淹没。
    千里路程的参观，波兰十二年来社会主义建设的肯定成就给周恩来总理等人留下了难忘的印象。在罗兹参观完两个波兰最大的纺织工厂等地方后，总理同波兰统一工人党政治局委员萨姆布罗夫斯基、当地市委第一书记塔塔科夫纳有这样的谈话。
    周总理问：“这里的高等教育事业情况怎样？”
    塔塔科夫纳回答说：“战前这里一个大学也没有，现在有十个大学。”
    周总理问：“什么人在这些学校里学习？”
    塔塔科夫纳说：“绝大部分是工人和农民的子女。”
    周总理问：“这里的就业情况怎样？”
    萨姆布罗夫斯基回答说：“战前工人每星期只能做二、三天工作，现在早就充分就业了，反之，现在感到缺乏劳动力。”
    周总理称赞说：“这很好。”
    这时，周总理马上对周围的波兰报刊记者说：“罗兹的就业比例超过英国的曼彻斯特。应该有信心，这是社会主义的优越性。资本主义是要没落的，这个制度是没有什么可以羡慕的。社会主义制度像东升的太阳，会一天天红起来并照耀到世界的每个角落。中国的工人阶级相信这一点，我觉得，波兰工人阶级也是相信这一点的。”的确，事实是最有说服力的，那些企图一笔抹煞由波兰人民血汗努力而得来的成就的人或看不清这种成就的人，现在在波兰是愈来愈少了。
    中国客人在各地的参观虽然仓促，但是仍然尽可能多地了解在最近一段时期以来在波兰发生的新的事物和波兰人民的实际生活。在弗罗茨瓦夫的车厢工厂，总理详细询问了最近成立的工人委员会的组成、任务和作用，以及工人委员会同厂长、党委会和工会的关系，总理了解到，厂长不是工人委员会的委员；在罗兹的有四千工人的“华沙保卫者”纺织工厂，今年元旦成立的工人委员会的主席向总理说：“我们和工厂行政领导合作一起尽力完成生产计划。”总理就马上拉他同工厂党委书记、工会主席和厂长一起干酒一杯。波兰工人的工资待遇、物质生活等问题，也是中国客人十分关心的问题。在访问工人职员住宅区的时候，总理向一位女小学教员询问工资收入和开支情况。这位青年妇女说，她和她丈夫的工资加在一起是每月一千七百兹罗提，每月房租是一百五十兹罗提，其余的款项基本上就花在伙食上面了，因为这里的肉需三十兹罗提一公斤，面包三兹罗提一公斤，而这个家庭已有三个小孩了。在有一千多年历史的古城克拉科夫，总理等人参观了该城最大的瓦维尔教堂，像一般教堂的共同特色一样，走进这个教堂后的直接感觉是深暗和幽静，在这种宗教气氛里，两个年轻的姑娘跪在那里向上帝祈祷。后来打听到，在波兰信教的人在全国人口中还占很大的比例。
    中国政府代表团访问波兰的期间，正是临近波兰议会选举的日子。1月20日，波兰全国将举行议会选举。如果说，这次选举前和选举期间民主和反民主力量有着比较复杂的斗争，是符合实际情况的。在各城市欢迎中国总理的群众集会上，代表波兰政府发言欢迎总理的中央领导人，都被指定是这个城市的议员候选人。波兰总理西伦凯维兹是克拉科夫市的议员候选人，他在克拉科夫市欢迎中国客人的群众集会上也谈到了选举的问题。在罗兹，周总理问一个家庭主妇投谁的票，那位中年妇女回答得斩钉截铁：“我、我丈夫和我儿子都是党员，我们当然投统一工人党候选人的票。”但是，记者本人也听到这样令人惊异的事实，有个别的有党证的党员竟反对自己党的候选人。
    1月15日，中国政府代表团从波兰各地参观后回到华沙了。在当晚中国大使馆举行的宴会上，周总理的发言受到了极大的重视。他说，中国共产党支持波兰人民在以哥穆尔卡为首的统一工人党中央领导下在八中全会以后所取得的成就。
    中国政府代表团在波兰的访问已经告一段落。在这些日子里，我愈来愈强烈地感到中国政府代表团在同波兰各方面人士广泛的接触中，已经为在共同的事业中更好地彼此了解、彼此支持开辟了更坚实宽广的道路。
    周总理等人带着波兰人民对中国人民那种深挚恳切的情谊离开了华沙。　（16日）
