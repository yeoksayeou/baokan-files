Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd: The National Professional Song and Dance Performance opened tonight simultaneously at the Capital Theater and the People's Theater in Beijing.

The "Shaanbei Group Dance" performed by the Shaanxi Province delegation and the "Northeast Group Dance" performed by the Liaoning Province delegation were full of distinct local characteristics. The choreographers of these two dances painstakingly collected many folk dances popular in the local areas. The "Shaanbei Group Dance" adopted the form of "Tichangzi" (a type of folk performance), while the "Northeast Group Dance" adopted "Errenzhuan" (a type of Chinese folk dance and performance) and "Dayangko" (a popular Chinese folk dance).

The delegation from the Ministry of Forestry Industry performed a unique "Stilt Dance."

The Jiangsu Province delegation performed the "Huaxiang Drum Dance," a dance from ancient legends.

Most of tonight's performances were dance programs. In addition, singers from the Shaanxi and Liaoning Province delegations sang folk songs from Shaanbei and Northeast China. Folk artists from Liaoning Province played folk music.
