The younger female textile workers' impressions of the tragic lives of female workers in the old society are gradually fading. New living conditions and free marriage have allowed many young women to plan their own happy family lives early on. However, among the 180,000 female textile workers in Shanghai, there are still some middle-aged female workers who feel lonely and depressed in their lives. The life experiences in the old society and prejudices about marriage have caused these older sisters to miss their youth. They hope for care and help.

More Important Than Appearance

At the Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill, many people know the story of a test worker named Jin. She is a person with a solitary disposition, silent eyes, working quietly. Every day after work, after eating, while the younger sisters in the dormitory are still laughing and joking, she covers her head with a quilt and goes to sleep alone. Life seems to have lost its joy for her. She is already in her thirties and has some smallpox scars on her face from childhood, and still doesn't have a partner. The younger sisters in the workshop and the female members of the trade union are very concerned about her marriage.

Last March, the trade union received a letter from the trade union of a slide projector factory, hoping that Shenxin No. 9 Factory would help introduce a girlfriend to a demobilized soldier. The other party was in his thirties. Huang Meifang, a warm-hearted female trade union member, immediately contacted the other factory. After learning about the demobilized soldier's situation, she felt that Sister Jin was quite suitable. She introduced everything about Jin in detail to the other party, who readily said: "What is important is not the appearance, but to see if she is good at production and if their personalities are compatible." Through the introduction, the two gradually became familiar with each other. From then on, this female worker no longer covered her head and went to sleep after work, and started to talk and laugh. She and the demobilized soldier established a happy family last National Day. Recently, she shyly told her younger sisters: they are going to have a child, and her husband is very considerate of her, and doesn't even let her wash the sheets and quilts herself.

More Help is Needed

In this Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill with nearly five thousand female workers, there are about one hundred such middle-aged, single female workers. Some comrades from the Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations of this factory are very concerned about the marriage problems of these female workers.

The warm-hearted female trade union member Huang Meifang is one of them. Huang Meifang has worked in the textile factory for more than ten years, and she told me a lot about the tragic experiences of female workers in the old society. Now, times have changed, living conditions have improved, and people's attitudes towards marriage have also changed. These older sisters who were delayed in their youth in the old society also long for a happy family life. However, they are not as lively and sociable as young girls. They need more help from their comrades.

In the past six months, the comrades of Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill have established contact with some factories and units in the city with more male workers. Through understanding and introduction, more than a dozen middle-aged female workers in the factory have met friends. Huang Meifang told me: All we do is to help them find a suitable partner, help both parties understand the situation, and then introduce them to each other. What happens next depends on the wishes of both parties.

He is Also My Child

At the State-owned No. 12 Cotton Mill, I met female worker instructor Wu Jinxiu. Tall, with a slightly thin face, she looks no more than thirty years old. Who would believe that she already has a thirteen-year-old child! She married at seventeen, and her husband died when she was twenty-two. Her mother-in-law blamed her for having a bad fate and "killing" her husband. Crying, she went to Shanghai to work. For nearly ten years, she has lived with her mother, depending on each other for survival; her son is studying at her mother-in-law's house in Wuxi, and she sends money back to raise him. Before liberation, she resented her bitter fate and never wanted to marry again, hoping that her son would grow up so that she would have someone to rely on in her old age. In the seven years since liberation, the society and factories have undergone earth-shaking changes, and she herself has joined the Communist Party, always taking the lead in production. She saw many sisters get married and have happy family lives. What about herself? She began to think about marriage.

Chen Guifang, the chairman of the workshop trade union, who has worked with Wu Jinxiu for ten years, is a warm-hearted person. Her husband has a good friend named Gao Zhengguang, who is about the same age as Wu Jinxiu. She decided to introduce these two people.

For nearly half a year after the introduction, the two had a very good relationship and were preparing to get married last National Day. However, when the time came, Wu Jinxiu hesitated and the wedding date was delayed... It was not until this year's New Year's Day that they finally got married. Before this, I met Wu Jinxiu and deliberately asked her: "Why didn't you want to get married on National Day?" Her face flushed and she whispered to me: "I was a little hesitant because of the child. One day, I wanted to test his attitude towards my child, so I deliberately said to him: I won't send money to the child anymore. He immediately said, we should send it, your child is also my child, we should let the next generation live a happier life. He also wanted me to bring the child to Shanghai to study. When he said that, I felt relieved. That's why I agreed to marry him."

People Who Are Afraid of Marriage

In the weaving workshop of this factory, Li Yuming, the chairman of the workshop trade union, told me a story about a middle-aged female worker who used to be afraid of marriage:

"Her name is Tang Xiaomei, she is thirty-six years old this year, she is very thin and honest. She got married in 1953 and is very happy now. In the past, if anyone advised her to get married, she would not listen. She said that she saw her mother was too miserable, the days were hard, not to mention, she was often beaten and scolded by her husband. She was afraid of living that kind of life, and felt that being single was more free and easy.

"In the past few years since liberation, she saw that other female workers had gotten married, their lives had improved, and husbands no longer beat and scold their wives. Gradually, she no longer refused people from mentioning marriage to her.

"Later, after several of us comrades discussed it, we decided to introduce Zhang Faxiang to her, who is her current husband. Zhang Faxiang also worked in this factory, and is now a cadre of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Textile Trade Union. He is a very good person, and a good match for Tang Xiaomei. Zhang Faxiang's ex-wife died and he has three children, the eldest daughter is already married. After they got married, the couple had a very good relationship. Tang Xiaomei treats Zhang Faxiang's ex-wife's children very well. After getting married, she often smiles, and is no longer like she used to be, avoiding people when she sees them."

    大姐们的婚事
    新华社记者　高洁
    年轻的纺织女工们对于旧社会女工悲惨生活的印象，逐渐地淡薄了。新的生活条件和自由的婚姻，使得许多年轻的姑娘，早就安排好了自己美好的家庭生活。但是，在上海十八万纺织女工中，还有一些在生活中感到孤独和苦闷的中年女工，旧社会的生活遭遇和婚姻的偏见，使得这些大姐们错过了青春。她们期望关怀和帮助。
    重要的不是外表
    在申新第九棉纺织厂，很多人都知道一个姓金的试验工的故事。她是一个性情孤癖的人，沉静的眼神，默默地工作；每天下了班，吃过饭，当宿舍里的小姊妹还在嘻嘻哈哈取笑作乐的时候，她却独自蒙上被头睡觉了。生活对她似乎失去了乐趣。她已经三十多岁了，脸上有些幼年出过天花的斑痕，到现在还没有对象。车间里的小姊妹和工会女工委员都很关怀她的婚姻大事。
    去年3月，工会收到一个幻灯厂工会写来的信，希望申新九厂帮助一个转业军人介绍女友。对方三十多岁。热心的女工委员黄梅芳立即到对方工厂联系。她了解了转业军人的情况以后，觉得金大姐挺合适。她向对方详细介绍了金的一切，对方很爽快地说：“重要的不是外表，要看生产好，性格合不合得来。”经过介绍，两人逐渐熟悉起来。从那时起，这个女工不再下了班就蒙头睡觉，变得有说有笑了。她同那位转业军人在去年国庆节建立了美好的家庭。最近，她羞答答地告诉小姊妹：他们将要有孩子了，丈夫很体贴她，连床单、被头也不让她自己洗。
    需要更多的帮助
    就在这个将近五千名女工的申新第九棉纺织厂，大约有一百名这样的中年、单身的女工。这个厂的党、团和工会组织的一些同志很关怀这部分女工的婚姻问题。
    热心的女工委员黄梅芳就是其中的一个。黄梅芳在纺织厂里做了十多年工，她告诉了我很多女工在旧社会的悲惨遭遇。现在，时代变了，生活改善了，人们对婚姻的观念也变了，这部分在旧社会耽误了青春的老大姐们，同样渴望着美好的家庭生活。但是，她们又不像年轻姑娘那样活泼、善于交际。她们需要同志们更多的帮助。
    申新第九棉纺织厂的这些同志，半年多来已经同本市一些男工多的工厂和单位建立了联系，经过了解、介绍，使厂里十多个中年女工结识了朋友。黄梅芳告诉我：我们所做的不过是负责帮助她们找到合适的对象，帮助双方了解情况，然后介绍他们认识。以后的事就看他们双方的心愿了。
    他也是我的孩子
    在国棉十二厂，我结识了女工教练员吴金秀。高高的身材，微微清瘦的脸庞，看上去不过三十岁上下。谁会相信她已经有了一个十三岁的孩子呢！她在十七岁结婚，二十二岁那年丈夫就死了。婆婆怪她命不好，“克”死了丈夫。她哭着到上海做工。将近十年了，她同自己的母亲住在一处，相依为命；儿子在无锡婆婆家念书，由她寄钱回去养育。解放以前，她怨自己命苦，再也不愿结婚，巴望儿子长大，将来老有所靠就行了。解放以后七年来，社会、工厂都起了翻天复地的变化，她自己也加入了共产党，生产中总是积极带头。她看到许多姊妹结了婚，家庭生活美满幸福，自己怎么办呢？她开始想到结婚。
    同吴金秀一起作了十年工的车间工会主席陈桂芳，是个热心的人，她的丈夫有个好朋友高正光，年纪同吴金秀差不多。她决心给这两个人介绍。
    介绍以后将近半年，两人感情很好，并且准备在去年国庆节结婚。但是，到时候吴金秀犹豫了，婚期延迟了下来……。一直到今年的元旦，他们终于结婚了。在这以前，我见到吴金秀，故意问她：“你为什么不肯在国庆节结婚呢？”她刷的脸红了起来，低声告诉我说：“我是为了孩子有些拿不定主意。有一天，我想试试他对我孩子的态度，故意对他说：我不给孩子寄钱了。他马上说，应该寄，你的孩子也就是我的孩子，我们应当让下一代生活得更幸福。他还要我把孩子接到上海来念书。他这样说，我也就放心了。我这才答应同他结婚的。”
    害怕结婚的人
    就在这个厂的织布车间，车间工会主席李玉明向我讲了一个原来害怕结婚的中年女工的故事：
    “她名字叫唐小妹，今年三十六岁，个子很瘦小，是个老实人，1953年结的婚，现在很幸福。过去，谁要是劝她结婚，她听也不要听。她说，她看到自己的母亲太惨了，日子苦不用说了，还经常挨丈夫打骂，她怕过那样的日子，觉得结婚不如一个人自由自在。
      “解放后这几年来，她看到别的女工都结了婚，生活好了，丈夫也不再打骂妻子。渐渐地，她不再拒绝人家向她提结婚的事了。
      “后来，我们几个同志商量以后，决定给他介绍张发祥，就是她现在的丈夫。张发祥也在本厂做过工，现在是中国纺织工会上海市委员会的干部，人很好，同唐小妹正配得上。张发祥前妻死了，有三个孩子，大女儿已经出嫁。他们结婚以后，夫妻感情很好。唐小妹待张发祥前妻的孩子非常好，结婚后，她时常笑迷迷的，再不像过去那样见了人就躲得远远的了。”
