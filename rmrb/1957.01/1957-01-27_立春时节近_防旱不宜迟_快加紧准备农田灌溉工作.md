Xinhua News Agency, January 26th: The Beginning of Spring (February 4th) is fast approaching, and due to the poor progress of farmland irrigation in northern provinces during the last winter, rainfall and snowfall have generally been scarce, and soil moisture is insufficient. In order to prevent spring drought and ensure increased agricultural production, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Water Resources jointly issued a notice on the 25th to step up preparations and promptly carry out spring farmland irrigation work.

The notice requires all localities to strengthen leadership, and according to local conditions, in conjunction with the current winter production, study and arrange spring farmland irrigation work, specifically incorporate this work into the spring plowing production plan, and adopt various effective measures to rely on agricultural cooperatives to actively carry it out. Before irrigation, all irrigation projects should be inspected and repaired as necessary, and attention should be paid to the configuration and repair of water lifting tools, and actively promote the waterwheels accumulated in the past. In order to avoid potential conflicts arising from water shortages during drought, and to fully utilize water resources to expand irrigation benefits, idle land can be irrigated as early as possible. During the irrigation period, it is necessary to insist on day and night irrigation, improve irrigation methods, increase irrigation efficiency, and at the same time educate farmers to cherish water and prevent waste.

The notice concludes by pointing out that closely integrating spring farmland irrigation work with agricultural cultivation measures is a necessary condition for ensuring increased production. Therefore, agricultural and water conservancy departments in various localities should closely cooperate and collaborate, and strengthen technical guidance to agricultural cooperatives, in order to facilitate increased production.

    立春时节近　防旱不宜迟
    快加紧准备农田灌溉工作
    据新华社26日讯　立春时节（2月4日）快要到来，而北方各省由于去年冬季农田灌溉工作开展较差，一般雨雪稀少，土壤底墒不足。为了防止春旱，保证农业增产，农业部和水利部在25日发出了加紧准备及时开展春季农田灌溉工作的联合通知。
    通知要求各地加强领导，根据当地情况，结合目前冬季生产，研究布置春季农田灌溉工作，把这一工作具体安排在春耕生产计划以内，采取各项有效措施，依靠农业社积极进行。在灌溉以前，应当对所有灌溉工程进行必要的检修，并且注意提水工具的配置检修，积极推销过去积存下来的水车。为了免除天旱用水紧张可能发生的矛盾，并且充分利用水源扩大灌溉效益，休闲地可以尽量提早灌溉。灌水期间，必须坚持昼夜灌溉，改进灌水方法，提高浇地效率，同时教育农民爱惜水量，防止浪费。
    通知最后指出，密切春季农田灌溉工作和农业耕作措施的结合，是保证增产的必要条件。因此，各地农业、水利部门应该密切配合协作，加强对农业社的技术指导，以利增产。
