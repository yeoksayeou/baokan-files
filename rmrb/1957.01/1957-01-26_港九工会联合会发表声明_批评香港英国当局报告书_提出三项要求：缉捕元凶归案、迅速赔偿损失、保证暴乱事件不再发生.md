Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 25th – Hong Kong News: The Hong Kong and Kowloon Trades Union Council issued a statement regarding the "Report on the Kowloon and Tsuen Wan Riots" by the British authorities in Hong Kong.

The statement pointed out that the report issued by the British authorities in Hong Kong touched upon some facts. "These facts are no different from the consistent atrocities of Kuomintang secret agents, which is sufficient to show that the Kowloon and Tsuen Wan riots were created by Kuomintang secret agents and could not have been done by just some 'triad figures'." The statement then criticized the report for "on the one hand, acknowledging the facts, but on the other hand, refusing to draw the conclusions that should be made based on the facts. This is a self-contradictory statement; objectively, it exonerates the Kuomintang secret agent murderers, which makes all workers and residents of Hong Kong deeply dissatisfied."

The statement said: Many of the residents in the resettlement areas are workers, and the majority of these residents are patriotic and also hope to live peaceful lives. Therefore, the report's claim that the riots were caused by a struggle between "left" and "right" factions, and that there was a background of "refugees" from the mainland, etc., "cannot but obscure the truth of the facts, and the actual effect is sufficient to cover up the crimes of Kuomintang secret agents."

The statement said: "Secondly, the report also believes that the losses of peaceful residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon were serious during this riot. Therefore, the spokesperson of the British authorities in Hong Kong has responsibly stated that consideration will be given to compensation for injuries (including those who died from injuries), losses, theft, and property damage caused by the riots. We believe that 'past experience, if not forgotten, is a guide for the future.' If the British authorities in Hong Kong can take this riot as a serious lesson, pursue and bring to justice the masterminds of this riot, and promptly take responsibility for compensating all the losses of the victims, then even if it is 'mending the fold after the sheep have been lost,' it is still a relatively responsible measure. However, it has been more than three months since the riot, and the compensation plan has not yet been announced. The grievances of the deceased worker compatriots have not been redressed, and the work of punishing the perpetrators and handling the aftermath is obviously slow." "We believe that the British authorities in Hong Kong should actively take responsibility, announce the compensation plan as soon as possible, so that the losses suffered by factories, shops, schools, studios, residences, and trade union halls and workers' welfare institutions affected by this riot can be compensated, and generous pensions should be given to the families of the deceased workers and residents, so that the future lives of the bereaved families can be properly taken care of."

The statement then severely criticized the statement by the British authorities in Hong Kong that "the danger of events similar to those that broke out in October still exists," pointing out that the British authorities in Hong Kong have a responsibility to "prevent troubles before they happen and quell crises before they erupt. Severely punishing the Kuomintang secret agent ringleaders is the way to eliminate the source of chaos. The masterminds who organized and planned the riots are still at large, which means the root of the disaster is still there. We believe that the responsibility for protecting the lives and property of Hong Kong residents rests entirely with the British authorities in Hong Kong." "We believe that the British authorities in Hong Kong must severely punish the masterminds of the riot, eliminate the root of the disaster, take effective security measures, and guarantee that riots will not happen again."

The statement finally reiterated three demands to the British authorities in Hong Kong: First, arrest the murderers and arsonists and bring them to justice to completely eliminate the root of the disaster. Second, promptly take responsibility for compensating the losses suffered by workers and residents in the Kowloon and Tsuen Wan riots, and provide generous pensions to the families of the victims. Third, guarantee that riots will not happen again, earnestly take effective security measures, and protect the safety of the lives and property of workers and residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

    港九工会联合会发表声明
    批评香港英国当局报告书
    提出三项要求：缉捕元凶归案、迅速赔偿损失、保证暴乱事件不再发生
    新华社广州25日电　香港消息：港九工会联合会就香港英国当局的“九龙及荃湾暴动报告书”发表了一项声明。
    声明指出，香港英国当局发表的报告书曾接触到一些事实，“这些事实与国民党特务一贯的暴行并无二致，这就足以说明九龙、荃湾暴乱是由国民党特务分子所制造的，绝非单是一些‘黑社会人物’所能干出来的”。声明接着批评了报告书“一方面承认了事实，但另一方面又拒绝了根据事实所应作出的结论，这是自相矛盾的说法；在客观上为国民党特务凶手开脱罪名，使全港工人居民深感不满。”
    声明说：徙置区的居民中有很多是工人，这些居民的大多数都是爱国的，大家也同样希望过和平生活。因此报告书所谓暴乱的引起是“左”“右”两派的斗争，又说有大陆来的“难民”的背景等等说法，“都不能不模糊了事实的真相，其事实效果适足以掩饰国民党特务分子的罪行。”
    声明说：“其次，报告书也认为在这次暴乱中港九和平居民的损失是严重的，因此，香港英国当局的发言人曾负责表示对于由暴乱所引起的伤害（包括因伤毙命者）损失、被窃及财产被破坏之赔偿加以考虑。我们认为‘前事不忘，后事之师’，香港英国当局如能以此次暴乱作为严重教训，对此次暴乱事件中的元凶祸首追缉法办，对受害者的一切损失迅速负责予以赔偿，则虽是‘亡羊补牢’，仍不失为比较负责的措施。但暴乱至今已三个多月，赔偿办法迟迟未见公布，死难工人同胞的沉冤未雪，惩凶及善后处理工作都显然是迟缓的”，“我们认为香港英国当局应该积极负起责任，早日公布赔偿办法，使此次暴乱受害的工厂、商店、学校、片场、住宅及工会会所与工人福利机构所受损失获得补偿，对死难工人居民优予抚恤，使遗属今后生活得到适当的照顾。”
    声明接着严厉地批判了香港英国当局“类似十月所爆发之事件，其危险仍常存在”的说法，指出：香港英国当局有责任“防祸患于未然，弭危机于未发。严惩国民党特务凶首，实为清除乱源之道。目前组织策划暴乱事件的元凶祸首仍然在逃，也就是祸机仍在。我们认为保障香港居民生命财产安全的责任全在于香港英国当局’，“我们认为香港英国当局必须严惩暴乱事件的元凶祸首，清除祸根，采取有效的治安措施，并保证暴乱事件不再发生。”
    声明最后向香港英国当局重申三项要求：一、缉捕杀人放火的元凶祸首归案法办，以彻底清除祸根。二、迅速负责赔偿此次九龙及荃湾暴乱事件中工人居民所受之损失，对被害死者遗属应优予抚恤。三、保证暴乱事件不再发生，认真采取有效的治安措施，保障港九工人居民生命财产的安全。
