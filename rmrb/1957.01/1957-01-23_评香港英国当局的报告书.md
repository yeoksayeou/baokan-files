A Critique of the Hong Kong British Authorities' Report

The Hong Kong British authorities recently published a report on the Kowloon riots of last October. While the report tries its best to exonerate Kuomintang secret agents and shirk the serious responsibility that the Hong Kong British authorities should bear for the riots, it cannot but acknowledge some well-known facts. These facts can only show that the riots were planned and organized by Kuomintang secret agents and that the Hong Kong British authorities have in practice adopted an attitude of shielding and even condoning these Kuomintang secret agents.

The culprits of the riots in the Kowloon area were Kuomintang secret agents. This was witnessed by countless residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon and clearly pointed out by many foreign journalists present at the time in their reports. Even this report by the Hong Kong British authorities cannot but mention that the "relevant masses" who first provoked the incident in the Kowloon urban area "largely included resettlement residents believed to be Kuomintang members," and that before the Tsuen Wan riots, there had been a "series of meetings" attended by "Kuomintang members," "the result of which was that the events in Tsuen Wan followed the same pattern." The report also acknowledges that rioters were generally "led by people carrying Kuomintang flags," and that large numbers of rioters causing disturbances everywhere in the Kowloon urban area were "led" by members of the 14K gang, which is a "semi-official political underground organization of the Kuomintang, whose members are mostly Kuomintang army personnel and junior officials." The report also mentions that the Tsuen Wan rioters had common identification marks and pre-arranged signaling methods. From these bits and pieces of affirmed facts in the report, it is not difficult to see that the riots were obviously created by Kuomintang secret agents, and had a political background and purpose. Even the London Times, in its editorial on October 23 last year, could not but point out that despite the various kinds of people who participated in the riots, "all the evidence proves that the Kowloon riots were planned by the Kuomintang secret service."

In order to cover up the responsibility of Kuomintang secret agents in planning and organizing the riots as much as possible, the report deliberately divides the entire incident in the Kowloon area into two unrelated parts: the riots in the Kowloon urban area and the riots in Tsuen Wan. At the same time, it tries to confuse the masterminds of the riots with those who were exploited, deceived, or even coerced into participating in the riots to varying degrees. The report tries its best to portray the Kowloon urban area riots and the Tsuen Wan riots as accidental coincidences, or even of different natures. It should be pointed out that the Tsuen Wan riots followed closely after the Kowloon urban area riots, and the report itself shows that the two riots had many things in common. For example, the rioters were all led by people carrying Kuomintang flags, Kuomintang 14K gang members, or those referred to as "Kuomintang members" in the report, were very active in the riots, and the spearhead of the riots was directed at patriotic and peaceful Chinese residents. It can be seen that the Kowloon urban area riots and the Tsuen Wan riots were both created by Kuomintang secret agents, closely linked together, and of the same nature.

Regarding the riots planned and organized by Kuomintang secret agents, the Hong Kong British authorities neither took the necessary precautions beforehand, nor adopted swift and effective measures afterward. The Hong Kong British authorities cannot but admit in the report that they were indeed at fault. For example, it mentions that "if the army had been called in to assist at an earlier stage, the situation could have been brought under control more quickly." The report also acknowledges that after the Tsuen Wan riots on October 11 last year, the police not only did not assume the responsibility of protecting the safety of people's lives and property, but instead withdrew from the riot site, allowing the rioters to "feel that the police were not confronting them, and were temporarily able to carry out activities in the city without being restrained." As a result, peaceful residents suffered significant casualties and losses. Therefore, the serious dereliction of duty by the Hong Kong British authorities cannot be excused for any reason.

Until now, people have not heard any news about the Kuomintang secret agent ringleaders who planned and organized the riots being caught and brought to justice. In fact, as long as the Hong Kong British authorities are determined to punish the perpetrators, the main criminals of the riots would not be difficult to find. The question is whether the Hong Kong British authorities will continue to implement their policy of shielding and condoning Kuomintang secret agents.

In recent years, Hong Kong and Kowloon have in fact become an increasingly large nest for Kuomintang secret agents, and a base for carrying out various sabotage activities against New China. Chinese property in Hong Kong has been repeatedly damaged and plundered. Many Kuomintang secret agents are trained in Hong Kong and then sent from Hong Kong to mainland China. The "Kashmir Princess" aircraft was destroyed by a time bomb planted by Kuomintang secret agents in Hong Kong. Kuomintang air force planes that harassed the Chinese coastal areas and were pursued used Hong Kong as a refuge. Despite repeated protests from the Chinese government and the Chinese people regarding these incidents, the Hong Kong British authorities have never taken responsible action. In the "Kashmir Princess" case, although the Hong Kong British authorities were forced to conduct some investigations and finally admitted that Kuomintang secret agent Zhou Ziming was the main culprit, they allowed this main culprit to escape safely to Taiwan, and sent other related criminals who had been arrested back to Taiwan. As for the Kuomintang air force plane that was chased and fled to Hong Kong, the personnel on board have also been sent back to Taiwan. These actions by the Hong Kong British authorities have aroused the indignation of the Chinese people and all justice-loving people in the world.

The reason why Kuomintang secret agents operating in Hong Kong and Kowloon are becoming increasingly unscrupulous, and dared to launch such serious riots in the Kowloon area last October, is completely inseparable from the consistent shielding and condoning by the Hong Kong British authorities. And the attitude of the Hong Kong British authorities in treating and handling these riots, including the report it recently published, can only show that the Hong Kong British authorities are still not prepared to abandon their consistent policy of shielding and condoning Kuomintang secret agents. This will inevitably further encourage the already rampant Kuomintang secret agents. The Hong Kong British authorities also admit in the report that "the danger of events similar to those that broke out in October still exists." But it attempts to attribute the root of this danger to the existence of "refugees from the mainland." This statement is not only to shirk its own responsibility for future similar events, but also to pave the way for Kuomintang secret agents to create new and more serious events. This attitude of playing with fire is very dangerous.

The report even refers to the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan as the "Kuomintang Government in Taiwan" and equates it with the Central People's Government of New China. The British side should understand that its practice of condoning and shielding Kuomintang secret agents in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and its attempt to create the so-called "two Chinas" conspiracy, are extremely unfriendly actions towards the Chinese people, and are resolutely opposed by the Chinese government and people.

More than three months have passed since the Kowloon riots. The people of all China and the world are watching how the Hong Kong British authorities will handle this incident. The Chinese people fully support the solemn protests and legitimate demands put forward in the statement issued by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 22. The Hong Kong British authorities should immediately arrest and severely punish the Kuomintang secret agents who created the Kowloon riots, properly compensate for the losses of all victims, including providing pensions to the families of the deceased, and effectively ensure the safety of the lives and property of Chinese residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and be responsible for ensuring that similar incidents do not happen again in the future.

### 评香港英国当局的报告书

    评香港英国当局的报告书
    香港英国当局最近发表了关于去年10月间九龙暴乱的报告书。报告书一方面极力设法开脱国民党特务分子的罪责和推卸香港英国当局对那次暴乱所应负的严重责任，可是另一方面却又不能不承认一些众所周知的事实，而这些事实只能表明那次暴乱是国民党特务分子所策划和组织的，表明香港英国当局对这些国民党特务分子实际上采取了包庇以至于纵容的态度。
    九龙地区暴乱的祸首是国民党特务分子，这是港九无数居民有目共睹的，也是当时在场的许多外国记者在报道中所明确指出的。这次香港英国当局的报告书也不能不提到：首先在九龙市区挑起事件的“有关的群众，大部包括徙置之居民被认为系国民党党员者”，而在荃湾暴乱发生前又曾经举行了有“国民党党员”参加的“一连串会议”，“其结果是荃湾发生之事均循同一模样”。报告书并且承认暴乱者普遍地“由携带国民党旗的人领导”，在九龙市区到处骚乱的大批暴徒系由14K党会员“率领”，而14K党是国民党的“半官式政治性的地下组织，其会员多系国民党陆军人员及低级官吏”。报告书还提到荃湾的暴乱者有着共同的识别标志和规定好的信号联系办法。从报告书中这些点点滴滴地加以肯定的事实中不难看出，那次暴乱显然是国民党特务分子所制造的、具有政治背景和目的的暴乱。就是伦敦泰晤士报在去年10月23日的社论中也不能不指出，尽管参加那次暴乱的有各种各样的人，可是“所有的证据证明，九龙的骚乱是国民党特务机关所策划的”。
    为了要尽可能地掩盖国民党特务分子策划和组织暴乱的责任，报告书一面故意把九龙地区的整个事件分成为九龙市区的暴乱和荃湾的暴乱两个不相关联的部分，一面又力图把暴乱的主谋者同在不同程度上被利用、被骗以至于被胁迫参加暴乱的人混淆起来。报告书极力想把九龙市区的暴乱和荃湾的暴动描写成为偶然凑合的，甚至是不同性质的。应该指出：荃湾的暴乱是紧随着九龙市区的暴乱而起的，而报告书本身也表明，两处暴乱有着许多共同之点。例如，暴乱者都是由手持国民党旗的人带头，国民党14K党分子或报告书中称为“国民党党员”的那些人在暴乱中都十分活跃，而暴乱的矛头又都是指向爱国的、和平的中国居民。由此可见，九龙市区的暴乱和荃湾的暴乱都是国民党特务所制造的、彼此紧密连结在一起的、性质相同的暴乱。
    对于国民党特务分子所策划和组织的暴乱，香港英国当局事先既没有作必要的预防，事后又没有采取迅速有效的措施。香港英国当局在报告书中也不能不多少承认自己确有失责之处。例如，它提到“倘能在较早时期，召请军队协助，则可更速将局面控制”。报告书也承认去年10月11日荃湾暴乱发生后，警察不但没有负起保护人民生命财产的安全的责任，相反地却从暴乱地点撤退，使暴徒“觉警察不向之对抗，暂能在该市展开活动，不受制阻”。从而使和平居民遭受了重大的伤亡和损失。因此，香港英国当局的严重失责，是不能以任何理由来辩解的。
    一直到现在，人们还没有听到策划和组织暴乱的国民党特务祸首落网法办的消息。其实，只要香港英国当局有惩凶的决心，暴乱的主要罪犯是不难找到的。问题在于香港英国当局是否将继续执行其包庇和纵容国民党特务分子的政策。
    这几年来，港九事实上已经日益成为国民党特务分子的一个巢穴，成为对新中国进行各种破坏活动的基地。中国的财产在香港一再遭到破坏和劫夺。不少国民党特务分子是在香港受特务训练然后从香港被派到中国大陆来的。“克什米尔公主号”飞机在香港被国民党特务分子装上的定时炸弹所破坏。骚扰中国沿海地区而遭到追击的国民党空军飞机把香港作为避难所。对于这些事件，尽管中国政府和中国人民曾经不断提出抗议，香港英国当局却从来没有作出负责的处理。在“克什米尔公主号”案件上香港英国当局虽然被迫不得不进行一些调查，并且在最后承认了国民党特务分子周梓铭是首犯，却又让这名首犯安然逃到台湾去。并且把其他已经逮捕的有关罪犯放回台湾。至于那一架被追击而逃到香港的国民党空军飞机，其机上人员也已经被送回台湾。香港英国当局的这种种做法，使中国人民和全世界主张正义的人民都感到愤慨。
    在港九活动的国民党特务分子所以越来越肆无忌惮，去年10月敢于在九龙地区掀起如此严重的暴乱，是同香港英国当局的一贯包庇和纵容完全分不开的。而香港英国当局对待和处理这次暴乱的态度，包括它最近所发表的报告书在内，又只能表明香港英国当局至今还不准备放弃它一贯包庇和纵容国民党特务分子的政策。这样就必然将使本来已经十分猖狂的国民党特务分子进一步得到鼓励。香港英国当局在报告书中也承认“类似十月所爆发之事件，其危险仍常存在”。但是它却企图把这个危险的根源说成是由于“来自大陆的难民”的存在。这种说法不仅是为今后发生类似事件时推卸自己的责任，而且是为国民党特务制造新的更严重的事件开辟道路。这种玩火的态度是十分危险的。
    这次报告书中还竟然把台湾蒋介石集团称为“台湾国民政府”，并且把它同新中国的中央人民政府相提并论。英国方面应该了解，它在港九纵容和包庇国民党特务分子的做法，它企图制造所谓“两个中国”的阴谋，是对中国人民极不友好的举动，是中国政府和人民所坚决反对的。
    九龙地区的暴乱已经过去三个多月了。全中国和全世界人民都在注视着香港英国当局对这次事件的处理。中国人民完全支持中国外交部1月22日声明中所提出的严正抗议和各项正当要求。香港英国当局应该立即逮捕并严惩制造九龙地区的暴乱事件的国民党特务分子，妥善赔偿一切受害者的损失，包括抚恤死难者的家属在内，并且切实保障港九中国居民生命财产的安全，负责保证今后不再发生类似事件。
