Zhou Enlai's Speech

Dear Comrade Gomułka, dear Chairman of the State Council Zawadzki, dear Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz, dear comrades and friends:

First of all, please allow me to express, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, our heartfelt gratitude to the Polish government and people for your sincere and warm welcome and reception, which fully demonstrates the deep brotherly friendship between our two peoples.

In recent years, the friendly relations between our two countries have greatly developed. We have engaged in close cooperation in economics, trade, culture, and technology. This cooperation has brought great benefits to the socialist construction of our two countries. There is no doubt that this friendly cooperative relationship between China and Poland, based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, will continue to be consolidated and developed in the future.

Since my first visit to Poland two and a half years ago, we have been very pleased to see that your country has made much progress in all aspects of socialist construction. Of course, you have also encountered some difficulties, just as we ourselves constantly encounter some difficulties. The Chinese people are very concerned about your construction endeavors, regarding your achievements as our achievements, and your difficulties as our difficulties. However, our difficulties are all difficulties in the course of progress, and these difficulties can be overcome by relying on the united efforts of the people. We are comrades-in-arms in the great cause of building socialism. The Polish people can always count on the support of the Chinese people, just as the Chinese people are convinced that we can always get your support.

Both of our countries are members of the socialist family. We have common ideals and common goals. In all fundamental aspects, we share common interests and are closely linked. The close unity and friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Polish people, and the close unity and friendly cooperation between socialist countries, not only conform to the vital interests of the people of our socialist countries, but also serve as a reliable guarantee for world peace and the progress of mankind.

In international affairs, both of our countries resolutely pursue a peaceful foreign policy. The Polish people have made great efforts to ease international tensions and safeguard European collective security. The Chinese people are particularly grateful for Poland's consistent support in China's struggle to safeguard its own sovereignty. The Chinese people unanimously appreciate Poland's important contribution to ensuring peace in the Far East and Asia. The joint efforts of our two countries and all peace-loving countries and people have definitely led to a relaxation of international tensions. At present, although this relaxation has been obstructed by international reactionary forces, we believe that with the joint efforts of our socialist countries and all peace-loving countries and people, the conspiracies of international reactionary forces will certainly not succeed, and the cause of safeguarding world peace will surely be victorious.

Dear comrades and friends, please allow me to thank you once again for your warm reception. I propose a toast:

    To the unbreakable brotherly friendship between China and Poland,
    To the solidarity between socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union,
    To world peace,
    To the health of the leading comrades of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish government,
    Cheers!

专栏：

    周恩来的讲话亲爱的哥穆尔卡同志，亲爱的国务委员会主席萨瓦茨基同志，亲爱的部长会议主席西伦凯维兹同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    首先，请允许我代表中国政府和人民向波兰政府和人民表示衷心的感谢，感谢你们给予我们的真诚而热情的欢迎和接待，这种欢迎和接待充分表现了我们两国人民之间的兄弟的深厚友情。
    近年来，我们两国的友好关系有了很大的发展。我们无论在经济、贸易或是在文化技术方面都进行了密切的合作。这种合作给我们两国的社会主义建设事业带来了极大的好处。毫无疑问，中波两国这种基于平等互利原则的友好合作关系，今后还会继续不断地巩固和发展。
    自从两年半以前我第一次访问波兰以来，我们十分高兴地看到你们的国家在建设社会主义的各个方面都获得了许多进展。当然，你们也遇到一些困难，正如同我们自己也不断遇到一些困难一样。中国人民非常关心你们的建设事业，把你们的成就看成是我们的成就，把你们的困难看成是我们的困难。但是，我们的困难都是前进中的困难，依靠人民群众团结一致的努力，这些困难是可以克服的。我们是建设社会主义的伟大事业中的战友，波兰人民永远可以指望中国人民的支援，正如同中国人民深信我们永远可以得到你们的支援一样。
    我们两国都是社会主义大家庭中的一员，我们有着共同的理想和共同的目标，我们在一切基本方面都是利害相关、休戚与共的。我们中波两国人民的亲密团结和友好合作，社会主义国家之间的亲密团结和友好合作，不但符合于我们社会主义各国人民的切身利益，而且也是世界和平和人类进步事业可靠的保证。
    在国际事务上，我们两国都坚决执行着和平的对外政策。波兰人民对于缓和国际紧张局势、维护欧洲集体安全，作了巨大的努力。中国人民特别感谢波兰在中国维护自己主权的斗争中所给予的一贯支持。中国人民一致赞赏波兰在保证远东和亚洲的和平方面所作出的重要贡献。我们两国和一切爱好和平的国家和人民的共同努力，曾经使国际紧张局势肯定地趋于和缓。目前，这种和缓局势虽然遭到了国际反动势力的阻挠，但是我们相信，在我们社会主义国家同一切爱好和平的国家和人民的共同努力之下，国际反动势力的阴谋是一定不会得逞的，维护世界和平的事业是一定要胜利的。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们，请允许我再一次感谢你们对我们的热情的接待。我提议：
    为中波两国牢不可破的兄弟友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义国家之间的团结，
    为世界和平，
    为波兰统一工人党和波兰政府的领导同志们的健康，
    干杯！
