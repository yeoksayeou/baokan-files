    An Example of Planned Mountain Construction

    Shiquanhu Village in Junan County, Shandong Province, formerly a hungry and impoverished mountain village, has now been transformed into a beautiful mountain village with grain, cotton, firewood, pocket money, convenient drinking water, and gardens full of melons and vegetables through the planned construction of the agricultural cooperative.

    On December 31, 1956, the Shandong Dazhong Daily published an editorial entitled "Congratulations to Shiquanhu." Shiquanhu is a small mountain village in Junan County. What great event has happened there that is worth celebrating?

    Shiquanhu was originally a very poor mountain village. In 1938, out of the village's twenty-eight households, thirteen worked as hired laborers, three as tenant farmers, four begged for food, and five "went to Guandong" (people from Shandong call fleeing famine to Northeast China "going to Guandong"), leaving only three households barely making ends meet at home. After liberation, the land reform was implemented, and mutual aid groups and cooperatives were organized, and people's lives gradually improved. In 1954, the average income per person in this small village was 820 jin of grain. However, in this small mountain ravine, "three days without rain leads to drought, and five consecutive days of rain leads to flooding." This still threatened further development of production and improvement of living standards. What should be done? In 1955, the Riguang Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative of Shiquanhu Village formulated a three-year plan (1955-1957) to rely on collective strength to plan and build the mountainous area and transform poor mountains into rich mountains.

    After two years of effort, the cooperative completed deep plowing, sand pressing, and terracing on a total of more than 350 mu of fields, and transformed more than 20 small plots of land into three large plots by cutting ridges and filling gullies. In the autumn of 1956, twelve cartloads of manure were applied per mu. These works have been completed or exceeded the targets for the last year of the three-year plan. The plan required the construction of three reservoirs in three years, and now two have been completed, using their stored water to irrigate 380 mu of land, accounting for more than 70% of the total cultivated area. In order to conserve water and soil, people built more than 100 "bundling mountain dikes" on barren mountains, built more than 450 "crescent weirs," and planted 300 mu of trees. The original plan was to open 100 mu of orchards and plant 6,500 fruit trees; now 200 mu of orchards have been opened and 7,200 trees have been planted.

    In 1956, under the threat of severe natural disasters, the total output of grain, cotton, and peanuts (the latter two are converted into grain) of the Riguang Cooperative was 188,000 jin, with an average yield of 360 jin per mu, an increase of 29 jin compared to 1955. The yield per unit area has reached 88% of the production target for the last year of the three-year plan.

    The Riguang Cooperative now has a total of 113 pigs raised publicly and privately, an average of two and a half per household, nearly twice the target of the three-year plan. The three-year plan requires the total income of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in 1957 to be more than 288,000 jin of grain; the total income in 1956 has reached 90% of this target.

    In this way, the three-year plan was basically completed in two years.

    Now, the Shiquanhu Cooperative branch of the Chinese Communist Party is leading the members in formulating the second three-year plan.

    In 1956, the Riguang Cooperative changed from a grain-deficient cooperative to a grain-surplus cooperative, and the income of every household in the cooperative increased. In the words of the cooperative members: Today's Shiquanhu Village is: there is grain, there is cotton, there is firewood for burning, there is pocket money, drinking water is convenient, and gardens are full of melons and vegetables!

    A poor, hungry, and cold small mountain village has become a beautiful paradise of abundance, which is indeed a great event worth celebrating.

    The Dazhong Daily's editorial believes that two experiences can be drawn from the construction of Shiquanhu Village. First, with cooperatives, farmers can rely on collective strength to gradually overcome the difficulties that cannot be overcome when working individually. Second, whether in mountainous areas or plains, as long as we formulate construction plans based on facts and resolutely implement the plans, we will surely achieve good results. The editorial especially praised the enthusiasm of the farmers in this mountain village for building socialism. The editorial said that the superiority of the cooperative must be brought into play by the people; the plan must be formulated and implemented by the people. When the Riguang Cooperative of Shiquanhu Village built its first reservoir, there were only forty-two male and semi-able-bodied laborers, who had to move 7,500 cartloads of stones and transport 20,000 cartloads of soil, while also carrying out winter and spring production. What a great difficulty this was! However, the difficulty did not scare the farmers of this cooperative, and they overcame the difficulty. It is precisely because they have such high socialist enthusiasm that they have achieved the victory of basically completing the three-year plan in two years.

    有计划地建设山区的榜样
    山东莒南县石泉湖村原来是一个饥饿的穷山村，经过农业社有计划的建设，现在已经变成有粮、有棉、有柴草烧、有零钱花、吃水便利、瓜菜满园的美丽山村了。
    1956年12月31日的山东大众日报发表了一篇社论，题目是“给石泉湖贺喜”。石泉湖是莒南县的一个小小的山村。它究竟有了什么值得庆贺的大喜事呢？
    石泉湖原来是一个很穷很穷的山村。1938年的时候，全村二十八户人家里，有十三户出外作雇工，三户当佃户，四户讨饭，五户“下了关东”（山东人把逃荒到东北叫“下关东”），只剩下三户勉强在家挨日子。解放了，土地改革实行了，互助组和合作社组织起来了，人们的日子才一步步好转了。1954年，这个小村庄每人平均收入八百二十斤粮食。可是，这个小山沟里，“三天不下雨旱死，五天连雨涝死”。这仍然是进一步发展生产和改善生活的威胁，怎么办呢？1955年，石泉湖村日光农林牧生产合作社订了个三年计划（1955—1957），要依靠集体力量有计划地建设山区，要变穷山为富山。
    经过两年的努力，这个社完成深翻地、压沙、整修梯田等措施的田共有三百五十多亩，并用削岭填沟的办法把二十多片小块土地改造成三大块。1956年秋季每亩上了十二车粪。这些工作都已完成或超过了三年计划最后一年的指标。计划要求三年里修建三座水库，现在已经完成两座，用它们的蓄水能浇地三百八十亩，占全部耕地面积的70％以上。为了保蓄水土，人们在荒山上垒起了一百多道“捆山约子”，筑起了四百五十多条“月牙堰”，栽植了三百亩的树木。原来计划开辟果园一百亩，栽种果树六千五百棵；现在已开辟了果园二百亩，栽上了七千二百棵树。
    1956年在严重的自然灾害的威胁下，日光合作社粮食和棉花、花生（后两者都按粮食折算）总产量是十八万八千斤，每亩平均产量是三百六十斤，比1955年增产二十九斤。单位面积产量已经达到三年计划最后一年生产指标的88％。
    日光社现在公养和私养的猪共有一百一十三头，每户平均两头半，接近三年计划指标的两倍。三年计划要求1957年农业、林业、牧业的总收入是二十八万八千多斤粮食；1956年的总收入已经达到这个指标的90％。
    这样，三年计划就在两年里基本上完成了。
    现在，中共石泉湖合作社支部正在领导社员们制定第二个三年计划。
    1956年日光合作社由过去的缺粮社变成了余粮社，并且全社户户增加了收入。用社员们的话来说：今天的石泉湖村是：有粮，有棉，有柴草烧，有零钱用，吃水便利，瓜菜满园！
    一个贫穷的、饥寒交迫的小山村变成了一个丰衣足食的美丽的乐园，这的确是一件值得庆贺的大喜事。
    大众日报的社论认为，从石泉湖村的建设中可以得出两条经验。第一、有了合作社，农民就能够依靠集体力量，逐步克服单干的时候不能克服的困难；第二、不论山区或平原，只要实事求是地作出建设计划，坚决地执行计划，就一定能够获得良好的成绩。社论特别赞扬了这个山村的农民建设社会主义的积极性。社论说，合作社的优越性，要人们去发挥；计划要人们去制定和执行。石泉湖村日光合作社建设第一座水库的时候，男整半劳动力只有四十二个，要搬七千五百车石头，运两万车土，同时还要进行冬季和春季生产，这是多么大的困难！可是，困难并没有吓住这个社的农民，困难被他们克服了。正因为他们有这样高昂的社会主义积极性，才取得了两年基本完成三年计划的胜利。
