Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 16th: The CPC Jiangsu Provincial Committee convened the Fourth District Committee Secretaries' Meeting, deciding to strengthen political and ideological work in agricultural production cooperatives.

The meeting, which lasted ten days, concluded on the 15th.

In Jiangsu Province, more than 8.16 million farm households have joined advanced agricultural production cooperatives, accounting for more than 90% of the total number of farm households. In 1956, the province suffered natural disasters more severe than those in 1954, but major agricultural and sideline production increased compared to 1954. However, after the realization of cooperativization in the province, some new contradictions and problems also emerged. Some Party organizations and cadres, in the high tide of the spring cooperativization movement, overestimated the "convenience" in work after cooperativization and relaxed political and ideological work. After the autumn harvest, when new problems and contradictions of the cooperatives gradually became exposed, some cadres lacked sufficient understanding of the superiority of cooperativization.

The meeting unanimously agreed that strengthening the Party's political and ideological work in cooperatives is the primary link in consolidating and improving cooperatives. It is necessary to enable cadres and Party members to correctly understand the superiority of cooperativization and unite and educate farmers to solve the problems and contradictions existing in the cooperatives together.

The secretaries of various district committees exchanged experiences at the meeting on strengthening political and ideological work and consolidating and improving agricultural cooperatives. In the Songjiang Special District, various counties conducted political and ideological work among cooperative members by summarizing the year's production and using detailed accounting methods. They ranked production achievements item by item, made specific analyses of natural disasters, and compared them with past disaster situations, enabling cadres and the masses to clearly recognize the superiority of cooperativization. They also calculated the state's support for the cooperatives, enabling everyone to correctly understand the great role of the worker-peasant alliance and state assistance in agricultural production. Guo Zhicheng, director of the Lianxing Agricultural Cooperative in Songjiang County, calculated an account: the entire cooperative's more than 3,000 mu of rice suffered typhoon and waterlogging disasters last year that were even greater than those in 1949, but the average yield per mu for the entire cooperative exceeded 1949 by 500 jin. He said: Without accounting, everything is muddled; with accounting, everything is clear. After accounting and comparison in the Songjiang Special District, cadres and the masses gradually overcame one-sided views such as only looking at bumper harvest years and not at normal years, only looking at spring plans and not at objective conditions, only looking at single-yield and not at total output, and only looking at current difficulties and not at future prospects. Everyone's enthusiasm was generally enhanced, and winter production flourished.

The meeting believed that while strengthening political and ideological work, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of democratic management of cooperatives and cultivate the independent ability of the cooperative management committee in business management. Under the guidance of the state, the management committee should formulate production, financial management plans of the cooperative according to its specific situation. Higher-level organizations should not interfere too much in the internal affairs of the cooperative. The management committee should be directly elected by the members' representative assembly, and any member can be elected as the director of the cooperative. The director should accept the supervision of the members and be re-elected if necessary. The members' representative assembly should establish a permanent system, holding a members' assembly or members' representative assembly at least once every quarter to review and deploy production and financial work for each quarter. Attention should be paid to absorbing old farmers to participate in the members of the management committee. After carrying out a large-scale discussion on "democratic management of cooperatives" last year, agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Jiangsu Province generally convened members' representative assemblies. Many cooperatives have seen a new atmosphere of good production, good management, and good relations, and moving examples of members loving the cooperative as their home. Cadres in these areas where democratic management of cooperatives has achieved significant results exchanged their experiences at the meeting.

The county committee members of various counties attending the District Committee Secretaries' Meeting believed that the key to improving rural work lies in improving the leadership of the county committee. The county committee must adhere to leading production and consolidating and improving cooperatives as the center of its work, and implement the principle of the secretary taking the lead and the whole party running the cooperatives. County committee leaders must face the grassroots, rely on the grassroots, and strengthen the construction of the Party's grassroots organizations. In the discussion, all counties generally made plans to transfer cadres to strengthen the grassroots.

Jiangsu Province has relatively convenient transportation, making it easy to concentrate cadres. The Provincial Committee has convened District Committee Secretaries' Meetings in recent years. Responsible cadres of county committees and regional committees also participated in this type of meeting, becoming the leading backbone of the conference. This type of meeting is actually a short-term training class. Provincial Committee leaders can fully understand the situation and problems in various aspects of actual work, unify policies and ideology, and avoid the shortcomings of layer-by-layer transmission and discounting when deploying work. The focus of this District Committee Secretaries' Meeting was to study the issue of further developing agricultural production and consolidating and improving agricultural cooperatives. Various regional committees and county committees also specifically studied future work deployments at the meeting. After the meeting, various rural tasks throughout the province will be rapidly unfolded.

### 加强党对农业社的政治思想工作  中共江苏省委员会召开第四次区委书记会议

    加强党对农业社的政治思想工作
    中共江苏省委员会召开第四次区委书记会议
    新华社南京16日电　中共江苏省委员会召开第四次区委书记会议，决定加强对农业生产合作社的政治思想工作。
    这次会议历时十天，已经在15日结束。
    江苏省现在参加高级农业生产合作社的农户有八百一十六万多户，占总农户的90％以上。1956年全省遭受了比1954年还重的自然灾害，而主要的农业、副业生产却比1954年有所增长。但是，全省实现合作化后也出现了一些新的矛盾和问题。有些党的组织和干部在春季合作化运动高潮中，过高地估计了合作化后工作上的“方便”，放松了政治思想工作。秋收以后，合作社新的问题和矛盾逐步暴露出来时，有些干部又对合作化的优越性认识不足。
    会议一致认为，加强党对合作社的政治思想工作是巩固和提高合作社的首要环节。要使干部、党员正确地认识合作化的优越性，团结和教育农民一起来解决合作社存在的问题和矛盾。
    各地区委书记在会议上交流了加强政治思想工作、巩固和提高农业合作社的经验。松江专区各县通过总结全年生产，用算细账的方法向社员进行政治思想工作。他们对生产成绩逐项排队，对自然灾害作了具体分析，并且和过去受灾情况比较，使干部和群众明确地认识到合作化的优越性。他们又算一算国家对合作社的支援，使大家正确认识工农联盟和国家援助对农业生产的重大作用。松江县联幸农业社主任郭志成算了一笔账：全社三千多亩水稻去年遭受了比1949年还大的台风和内涝灾害，但全社平均每亩产量超过1949年五百斤。他说：不算账糊里糊涂，一算账清清楚楚。松江专区经过算账对比，干部和群众逐步克服了只看丰收年景、不看通常年景，只看春天的规划、不看客观情况，只看单产、不看总产，只看眼前困难、不看以后远景等片面观点，大家的积极性普遍提高，冬季生产就蓬勃地开展起来。
    会议认为在加强政治思想工作的同时，必须坚持贯彻执行民主办社的方针，要培养社务管理委员会在经营管理上的独立能力。管理委员会应该在国家指导下，根据自己的具体情况，制定合作社的生产、财务经营管理计划。上级组织对社的内部事务不要干涉过多。管理委员会由社员代表大会直接产生，任何一个社员都可以被选为社长，社长应该接受社员的监督，并在必要时进行改选。社员代表大会应该建立常任制度，每季至少召开社员大会或社员代表大会一次，检查和部署每季度的生产和财务工作。在管理委员会成员中要注意吸收老农参加。江苏省各地农业生产合作社去年开展“民主办社”大讨论以后，普遍召开了社员代表大会。很多社出现了生产好、管理好、关系好的新气象和社员爱社如家的动人事例。这些民主办社获得显著效果的地区的干部，在会上交流了他们的经验。
    参加区委书记会议的各县县委委员认为，改进农村工作的关键在于改进县委的领导。县委必须坚持以领导生产和巩固、提高合作社作为工作的中心，并且执行书记动手，全党办社的方针，县委领导必须面向基层，依靠基层，加强党的基层组织建设。在讨论中，各县都大体作出了抽调干部充实基层的规划。
    江苏省交通比较方便，干部易于集中，省委在最近几年都召开了区委书记会议。各县县委和地委负责干部也参加这种会议，成为大会的领导骨干。这种会议实际上是个短期训练班，省委领导上可以充分了解实际工作中各方面的情况和问题，可以统一政策思想，并且在部署工作时避免了层层传达层层打折扣的缺点。这次区委书记会议的中心是研究进一步发展农业生产和巩固、提高农业社的问题。各地委和县委也在会议上具体地研究了今后的工作部署。会议以后，全省各项农村工作将迅速展开。
