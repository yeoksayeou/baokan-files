Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th - The Chinese medicine Clerodendrum trichotomum, commonly used to treat "rheumatic pain," is an effective drug for lowering blood pressure. This was discovered by Chinese and Western doctors in Shanghai in 1956 during their collaborative treatment of hypertension.

The team responsible for this research on Chinese medicine included Li Piguang and Ding Jimin, professors and physicians of internal medicine from the Shanghai Eleventh People's Hospital (Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital) and the Renji Hospital affiliated with the Shanghai Second Medical College, and eight others.

In the past year, the two hospitals used Clerodendrum trichotomum to treat a total of 171 hypertension patients (80% of whom were intellectual workers). After taking the medicine for two months, 130 of them experienced a decrease in blood pressure (an average reduction of diastolic blood pressure by more than 10 to 20 mmHg), and symptoms such as dizziness, palpitations, and insomnia were alleviated. Among them, the treatment effect was particularly significant for 78 people. It is also effective in treating patients with eye fundus changes caused by severe hypertension.

    中药臭梧桐可治高血压
    据新华社上海12日电　民间惯用的治疗“风湿痛”的中药臭梧桐是一种降低血压有效的药物。这是上海中、西医在1956年合作治疗高血压病中所发现的。
    担任这种中药研究的有上海市第十一人民医院（中医院）和上海第二医学院附属仁济医院的内科教授、医师李丕光和丁济民等十人。
    在去年一年中，两个医院用臭梧桐一共治疗了一百七十一个高血压病人（其中80％是脑力劳动者），他们在服药两个月以后，有一百三十人血压下降（平均降低舒张压十到二十毫米水银柱以上），头晕、心跳、失眠等症状减轻，其中有七十八人的治疗效果特别显著。对治疗因高血压较重而引起眼底变化的病人也有效。
