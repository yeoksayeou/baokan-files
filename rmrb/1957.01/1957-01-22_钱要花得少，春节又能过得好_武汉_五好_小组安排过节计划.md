Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 18th: Wuhan's "Five-Good" families are enthusiastically discussing plans for the Spring Festival. The "Five-Good" group of Quanan Lane, Liangdao Street, Wuhan, has received city-wide attention from "Five-Good" families for their approach to arranging the Spring Festival with the idea of "spending less money but still having a good Spring Festival." Many people have learned from their experience and made their own Spring Festival plans. The Wuhan Municipal Democratic Women's Federation also held a symposium for "Five-Good" activists to introduce their experiences.

The "Five-Good" group of Quanan Lane, Liangdao Street, consisting of thirty-two households, has been saving a few cents or a dime each day since last National Day to spend during the Spring Festival. They have now accumulated a total of 172 yuan. After careful calculation, they plan to spend 102 yuan for everyone to visit places of interest and buy "New Year's goods" during the Spring Festival, and the rest will be used for children's tuition or to buy public bonds. During the Spring Festival, they plan to change old customs by not entertaining guests, not giving gifts, not frying rice bubbles, not drying vermicelli, and not scalding bean curd threads, saving 122 jin of grain for the country. They also plan to help deaf, blind, and lonely elderly people living nearby before the Lunar New Year, and on the first day of the Lunar New Year, they will pay New Year's greetings to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and visit sister "Five-Good" groups. The plan also guarantees to do a good job in security and fire prevention work, and encourages loved ones not to be absent from work before and after the Spring Festival.
