Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 15th. Currently, all public transportation routes in Budapest, except for a few remote areas, have resumed operation. Every day, various vehicles fully loaded with passengers shuttle back and forth, giving people the feeling that life in Budapest is operating normally.

Budapest has fifty-five bus routes, seventy-one tram and trolleybus routes, and one underground tram line. As of the 14th, 1,500 tram carriages have been running on various lines, a number only 300 less than before the events of last October. All the buses of the bus company that are able to run are already on the routes, accounting for about 84% of the company's total buses, with the rest undergoing major overhauls.

Every day, from four or five o'clock in the morning, electric trains transport many suburban workers to the East and West railway stations in the city. Here, they are then transported to factories and offices by various buses and trams. After nine or ten o'clock in the morning, buses and trams carry housewives to the city center or various vegetable markets. Until eight or nine o'clock in the evening, public transportation in the city is still busy. Curfew in the city is from ten o'clock in the evening to four o'clock the next morning, and the electric train runs its last train at ten o'clock.

    布达佩斯公共交通恢复正常
    新华社布达佩斯15日电　目前，布达佩斯市内交通线路除了个别偏僻地区外已经全部恢复通车。每天，满载乘客的各种车辆川流不息地驶来驶去，使人感到布达佩斯的生活是正常地运转起来了。
    布达佩斯共有五十五条公共汽车线路，七十一条有轨和无轨电车线路和一条地下电车线路。从14日起，已经有一千五百节电车车厢在各条线路上行驶，这个数目只比去年十月事件前少三百节。公共汽车公司的汽车能够行驶的都已经在线路上行驶，约占公司全部汽车的84％，其余的正在进行大检修。
    每天从早上四、五点钟起，就有电气火车把许多住在郊区的职工运到市内的东、西两个火车站。他们在这里再由各路公共汽车和电车送到工厂和机关。到了上午九、十点钟以后，汽车和电车又载着主妇们到市中心或各个菜市。直到晚上八、九点钟，市内公共交通还忙碌着。市内从晚上十点到次晨四点戒严，电气火车在十点钟还开出最后的一班车。
