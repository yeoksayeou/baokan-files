    Self-Criticism Regarding the Destruction of Longquan Cultural Relics

    The People's Daily's criticism of our county's demolition of ancient pagodas and destruction of cultural relics (People's Daily, December 13th of last year) is correct. Due to the county party committee's lack of knowledge, insufficient study of policies, and the existence of bureaucracy, the relevant personnel were not stopped from demolishing three ancient pagodas and destroying the cultural relics within them. After the party newspaper's criticism, the county party committee immediately instructed Comrade Liu Yulan, a member of the county party committee, and Comrade Zhang Huiwu, the deputy county head, to convene several forums of relevant personnel, conduct several individual inquiries to verify the facts, and organize personnel to take various measures to track down the lost cultural relics. In addition, the county party committee also held an enlarged meeting of the standing committee to discuss and study this incident and learn from the lessons. In addition to assigning specific personnel to continue collecting the lost cultural relics, we will also strengthen the education of cadres and the masses and take measures to protect other existing cultural relics in our county.

    Currently, we are continuing to investigate and trace the process of pagoda demolition and the issue of responsibility. In order to enforce Party discipline and educate cadres, after the facts are clarified, the relevant personnel who destroyed these cultural relics will be given the punishment they deserve.

    关于破坏龙泉文物的检讨
    人民日报对于我县拆毁古塔破坏古物的批评（去年12月13日人民日报）是正确的。由于县委缺乏知识，学习政策不够，以及存在官僚主义，致对有关人员拆除三座古塔以及毁坏其中文物没有加以制止。在党报批评后，县委即责成县委委员刘玉兰同志和副县长张恢吾同志立即召开了几次有关人员座谈会，进行了数次个别了解，查对事实经过，组织人员采取多种办法追查散失文物。此外，县委还召开了常委扩大会议，对这事件进行讨论研究，接受教训。除指定专人继续收集散失文物外，并加强教育干部群众，采取措施保护我县现存其他文物。
    现在，拆塔的过程和责任问题，我们尚在继续了解追查中。为了严肃党纪，教育干部，待事实查清后，将给破坏这些文物的有关人员以应得的处分。　　　中共龙泉县委会
