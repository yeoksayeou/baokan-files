    In order to strengthen the ties between the Party and the people, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided that from the end of 1956 to February of this year, members and alternate members of the Provincial Committee, in conjunction with their work inspections, would go deep into rural areas, factories, mines, schools and meet with the masses, and give a report to the masses on the current situation and tasks or policy issues.
    The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party required that, in addition to current domestic and international affairs and current tasks, the content of the reports should also have different focuses depending on the different characteristics of rural areas, factories, mines, and schools, and the nature of the reporting person's work. In rural areas, the reports can focus on the main problems in current production and rectification, explain policies to the masses in the spirit of promoting positive factors and overcoming negative factors, and further enhance their socialist enthusiasm. In cities and industrial and mining enterprises, the emphasis should be on explaining the significance of building the country diligently and thriftily, increasing production and practicing economy, as well as policy issues related to current urban supply, handicraft production, and running cooperatives. In schools, in addition to explaining the current situation, the focus of the report should be determined according to the specific circumstances and ideological requirements of the teachers and students of each school.
