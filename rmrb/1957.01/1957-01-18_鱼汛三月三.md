Fish Spawning Season, March 3rd
Zhang Yongmei

    Untitled
    Misty drizzle… The drizzle is like a sea wave, submerging the mountains and erasing the villages. Only a mountain peak floats on the sea of fog; is that a small boat, rocking in the waves? Ten thousand golden threads from the mountain peak drag towards the fields and hills, my happy courtyard is right in the center of those ten thousand golden threads…

    Fish Spawning Season, March 3rd
    Fish spawning season, March 3rd, peach blossoms fly all over the beach, flower petals hang on the rope mooring the sail. Walking towards the peach blossom blooming shore, holding a green leaf and red flower umbrella, picking a few bundles of flowers, throwing them into the middle of the sea. The sea is dyed red, the waves—flying flames; ah, red flower fireworks, congratulating the fishermen for a bountiful year!

    鱼汛三月三
    张永枚
    无题蒙蒙白雾……白雾如海浪，淹没了群山，抹去了村庄。只有一座山尖，浮在雾的海上；那是一只小船，正在浪里摇荡？山尖万条金练，拖向田野山岗，我那幸福的庭院，就在万条金练中央……。	鱼汛三月三鱼汛三月三，桃花飞遍海滩，系帆的绳索上，花瓣挂一串。走向开桃花的海岸，打着绿叶红花的伞，拾几束花儿，投向海中间。大海染红了，浪——飞腾的火焰；啊，红的花火，贺渔家丰年！
