The Marriage Compulsion
　　Yu Tian
　　Lu Changjun, the chief of the secretariat section of the Gutian County Cooperative in Fujian Province, is engaged to the female switchboard operator, Yu Bingwen, but people are gossiping about it.
　　Two or three years ago, Section Chief Lu secretly fell in love with switchboard operator Yu. Of course, switchboard operator Yu had many adorable qualities, in addition to being young and beautiful, she also had a pure and kind heart. During her time with Section Chief Lu, she never thought that she and Section Chief Lu had any other relationship than that of superior and subordinate and comrades. In her view, she and Section Chief Lu had three incompatibilities: First, she was only seventeen years old at the time, not yet of marriageable age; second, her ideal lover was definitely not Section Chief Lu, because he was nearly forty years old, more than twice her age; third, and most heartbreakingly, she discovered that her superior had an ugly soul. In order to win her love, he often boasted in front of her about which level cadre he was and how much money he earned. Several times he called her in and tirelessly repeated guarantee after guarantee, saying that as long as she agreed to his demands, he would be willing to invest two sums of capital in her: one was a guarantee of joining the Communist Youth League, and the other was that money would not be a problem.
　　One day, in a very secluded place, Section Chief Lu took out a marriage application form that he had already written and asked switchboard operator Yu to stamp it with her seal. The girl was taken aback. She said, "I'm not old enough to get married, and I don't plan to deal with my marriage issues in such a muddled way." Section Chief Lu didn't believe this was the truth, so he didn't mind. But after only a few days, he found that she was starting to avoid him. In order to break the deadlock, he had to take another way to deal with her. He explained to her: "It's okay to disagree about our personal matter, but I hope that we can maintain normal comradely relations in the future." She didn't have anything against him in the first place, and how could a subordinate not see her superior? So she stopped avoiding him.
　　But soon, Section Chief Lu took out the application form again, asking her to stamp it and set a date for the wedding. It is said that switchboard operator Yu was overly emotional this time, and she tore the application form to shreds on the spot, scattering the pieces, almost making Section Chief Lu unable to save face.
　　However, Section Chief Lu had a lot of support in the Gutian County Cooperative. For example, some people with a "conscience" believed that Section Chief Lu was one of the most senior members of the cooperative, and even if he didn't have any merit, he still had worked hard, so he should have a satisfactory lifelong companion, especially someone who could be considerate and take care of him. They also believed that switchboard operator Yu's not loving Section Chief Lu was a manifestation of "bourgeois love views." The specific manifestations of bourgeois love views in her were "loving the young" and "loving the beautiful." Section Chief Lu also had a powerful ally, the chief of the cadre section. During the annual appraisal in 1954, the organization specially held a solemn appraisal meeting, and switchboard operator Yu's "bourgeois love views" were also listed as one of the appraisal procedures. In addition to the organizational cadres, the chief of the cadre section took the lead. He said that Yu Bingwen's love views were "bourgeois," and if she didn't correct them, she would ruin her future and be unable to join the Communist Youth League. At the end, he also announced that if Yu Bingwen did not accept the opinions, she would be handed over to the cadre meeting of the cooperative's board of directors for handling.
　　However, the result was still not as Section Chief Lu wished.
　　Section Chief Lu was, after all, a capable person. He had one last trump card. He warned Yu Bingwen with a gloomy and melancholic face: "If you don't agree to me, I will commit suicide immediately." A deputy section chief of the cadre section said it even more thoroughly and forcefully than Section Chief Lu, saying: If Section Chief Lu dies, you will bear all the responsibility. At this critical moment, what could Yu Bingwen do? She had no choice but to agree to marry Section Chief Lu. She endured all the pain and stamped her seal on a marriage application form drafted by someone else. But she didn't dare to look directly at the most glaring words in the application, "We are in love and willing to be husband and wife."
　　Now he and she are not yet married, she used "curing my leg disease before marriage" as a reason to urge Section Chief Lu to stay in a hospital in Shanghai. However, when Section Chief Lu's leg disease is cured and he returns to Gutian, if no one comes out to stop this act of forced marriage, perhaps Yu Bingwen will eventually be forced to become Section Chief Lu's wife.

    逼婚记
    雨田
    福建省古田县合作总社秘书科科长陆长钧已经和女收发员余秉文订婚了，可是人们却在纷纷议论。
    两、三年前，陆科长暗暗地爱上了余收发员。当然，余收发员有许多可爱之处，除了年青、漂亮以外，还有纯洁、良善的心地。在她和陆科长相处的日子里，她从来没有想到她和陆科长除了上下级和同志关系以外还有另外一种关系。在她看来，她和陆科长有三不合：第一，她当时仅有十七岁，还不到结婚年龄；第二，她理想中的爱人绝不是陆科长，因为他已经是近四十岁的人了，年龄相差一倍多；第三，使她最痛心的，是她发现自己的这位上级有一个丑恶的灵魂。他为了换取爱情常常在她面前夸耀他是哪一级干部，赚多少钱。有几次他把她叫去，不厌其烦地说了再说，一个保证又一个保证，只要她答应他的要求，他就愿意向她投放两笔资本：一笔是保证入团，另一笔是花钱不困难。
    某一天，在一个非常僻静的地方，陆科长拿出自己早已写就的一张结婚申请书要余收发员盖章。那位姑娘不禁大吃一惊。她说：“我还不到结婚年龄，而且不打算这样糊里糊涂处理自己的婚姻问题”。陆科长不相信这是真话，所以也不介意。可是没有过了几天，他已发现她开始躲避他了。他为了打开僵局，不得不采取另一种对付她的办法。他向她解释：“我们的个人问题不同意是可以的，但希望今后能够保留正常的同志关系”。她本来对他并没有什么过不去的事情，下级那能不见上级呢？因而她不再躲避他了。
    可是不久，陆科长又拿出那张申请书，要求她盖章，订期结婚。据说，余收发员这一次感情过分冲动，她当场把申请书撕得粉碎，片片飞扬，几乎弄得陆科长下不了台。
    可是，陆科长在古田县合作总社是大有人支持的。比如说，有几个抱着“良心”观点的人，都认为陆科长是社里数一数二的老资格，即使没有功劳也有苦劳，所以他应该有一个称心如意的终身伴侣，特别需要一个能够体贴、照顾他的人。他们还认为余收发员不爱陆科长就是“资产阶级恋爱观点”的表现。资产阶级恋爱观点在她身上的具体表现是“爱年青”、“爱漂亮”。陆科长还有一个有力的外援，那就是干部科科长。1954年年终鉴定时，机关特地举行了庄重的鉴定大会，余收发员的“资产阶级恋爱观点”也被列为鉴定程序之一。参加大会的除了机关干部以外，那位干部科长更是一马当先。他说，余秉文的恋爱观点是“资产阶级的”，不改正就要断送前途，更不能入团。临结束时，还宣布说：如果余秉文不接受意见，就交给合作社理事会干部大会处理。
    然而，结果还是没有能如陆科长的愿。
    陆科长毕竟算得是个有能耐的人。他还有最后一张王牌。他带着一副阴沉、忧郁的面孔向余收发员提出警告：“如果再不答应我，我就要立刻自杀”。干部科的一位副科长比陆科长还说得更透彻、更有力一些，他说：陆科长死了，你将负全部责任。在这千钧一发的时候，余秉文有什么办法想呢？她只好同意和陆科长结婚。她曾忍着一切痛苦在一张别人拟就的结婚申请书上盖上了自己的手章。但是她不敢正视申请书中最刺目的一段字迹，“我们之间，情投意合，情愿结为夫妇”。
    现在他和她还没有结婚，她借“治好腿病再结婚”为理由，促使陆科长到上海住了医院。然而，在陆科长腿病治好，回到古田的时候，如果再没有人出来制止这种逼婚行为，也许余收发员终将被迫成为陆科长的夫人了。
