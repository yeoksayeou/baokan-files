Invitations Arrive
Chen Yichao

On the eve of the Spring Festival, the soldiers of the Sixth Company of a certain unit of the Public Security Forces were overjoyed to receive an invitation to a joint celebration from the famous Si Jiqing Vegetable Production Cooperative of Beijing. In over a year of living together, the soldiers and the cooperative members had forged a close friendship.

Speaking of it, the cooperative members often cannot forget the support the Sixth Company soldiers gave them, and the Sixth Company soldiers also often recount the cooperative members’ friendship towards them.

The help the Sixth Company soldiers provided to the cooperative is endless. In the past, there was a section of road from the Si Jiqing Cooperative office to the middle of the road that was difficult to traverse. The members were often worried about accidents when they drove their carts full of vegetables to the market every day. After the Sixth Company stationed in Huangzhuang (a village of the Si Jiqing Cooperative), they quickly repaired this road. During the spring plowing last year, the cooperative was short of fertilizer, so the soldiers used their rest time after meals and holidays to help the cooperative dig more than 30,000 pits of fertilizer, braving the cold wind. When the cooperative was weeding the rice paddies, the soldiers would help whenever they had free time. The soldiers’ diligent and simple kindness deeply moved every member.

What the cooperative members cannot forget the most is the soldiers’ help in weeding the fields. Last summer, during the busy farming season, the sweet potato fields of the Si Jiqing Vegetable Production Cooperative’s youth production team were overgrown with weeds, and it was almost impossible to see a single sweet potato seedling. The team members were anxious but could not spare anyone to do the work. At this time, Zhang Shuqing, the Sixth Company commander, and his soldiers arrived. They worked under the scorching sun, pulling weeds until their hands bled. The team members felt very sorry and brought over tomatoes soaked in cold water, asking the soldiers to take a break and quench their thirst. However, no one stopped to accept this kindness. The team members had no choice but to urge the company commander to order the soldiers to rest. Coincidentally, as soon as the weeds in this sweet potato field were pulled, there was a thorough rain the next day, and the sweet potato seedlings visibly thrived.

When the Sixth Company soldiers needed help, the cooperative members always extended a hand of friendship. Last year, when the soldiers grew their own vegetables, the cooperative members picked the strongest green pepper and tomato seedlings and sent them over. The director of the cooperative even personally brought sorghum stalks to build tomato trellises. They were afraid that the soldiers would not know how to grow them, so they sent the cooperative’s technician. When the Sixth Company soldiers were building a kitchen, the cooperative provided carts to help transport materials. The people of Huangzhuang, both adults and children, were very concerned about the soldiers. If the soldiers’ clothes were blown away by the wind while they were washing and drying them, people would pick them up and return them. People even picked up the greatcoat buttons that the soldiers dropped on the road and hurried to return them.

Not long ago, the Sixth Company headquarters was about to leave Huangzhuang (a portion of the soldiers still lived there). On the night before they left, Wang Xiuqin’s mother, Aunt Wang, came to see Company Commander Zhang specifically. When she heard that the headquarters was really leaving, she talked and talked, and was very reluctant to leave. She even planned to invite the company commander to her house for a meal. After Company Commander Zhang politely declined her good intentions, she repeatedly told him, “When you come to the village again, be sure to come and sit at my house.”

Now, the invitation from the Si Jiqing Vegetable Production Cooperative inviting the Sixth Company to the Spring Festival celebration has arrived. Not only are the soldiers happy, but Company Commander Zhang is also very eager to see the old folks in Huangzhuang.

    请柬来了
    陈一超
    春节前夕，公安军某部六连的战士，接到了北京市有名的四季青蔬菜生产合作社联欢的请柬后，战士们个个高兴极了。在一年多的相处中，战士们和社员们已结成了亲密的友谊。
    提起来，社员们常常不能忘怀六连战士对他们的支援，六连战士也不时地述说社员们对他们的友情。
    六连战士对合作社的帮助是说不完的。过去，在四季青合作社办公室到马路中间有一段路很不好走，社员们每天赶着满载蔬菜的大车上市场的时候，经常担心怕在这里出事故。六连战士驻扎黄庄（四季青社的一个村）以后，很快就把这条路修好了。去年春耕的时候，社里很缺肥料，战士们便利用饭后休息和假日，冒着寒风帮助合作社挖了三万多坑肥。社里开稻田锄草，战士们只要一有空，就去帮忙。战士们这种勤劳而朴实的盛情，深深地感动了每一个社员。
    最不能使社员们忘情的，要算战士们帮助社员锄野草了。去年夏天，正当农忙的时候，四季青蔬菜生产合作社的青年生产队的白薯地里，杂草丛生，几乎望不到一根白薯苗。队员们干着急，就是抽不出人来。这时，六连连长张树清和他的战士们来了。他们在炎热的太阳底下做活，拔草拔得手都出了血。队员感到很过意不去，送来了用冷水浸的西红柿，请战士们休息一下，解解喝。可是没有一个人停下来接受这番盛意。队员们没了办法，急得要连长下命令让战士们休息。巧得很，这块白薯地的草刚拔完，第二天就落了一场透雨，白薯苗眼看着旺了起来。
    当六连战士们需要帮助的时候，社员们也总是伸出友谊的手来。去年战士们自己种蔬菜，社员们就拣了长得最茁壮的青椒、西红柿秧苗送来，合作社的社主任还亲自拿来了搭西红柿架子的高粱秆；他们怕战士们不会种，又派了社里的技术员来。六连战士们要盖厨房了，社里抽出大车来帮助运材料。黄庄人民，无论大人小孩，对战士们都非常关心，战士们洗晒的衣服被风刮到远处去，就有人给他们拾回来，甚至连战士掉在大路上的大衣扣子，人们也拾起赶着送来。
    不久以前，六连的连部要离开黄庄了（还有一部分战士住在那里），在他们要走的头一天晚上，社员王秀琴的母亲王大娘特意来看张连长，听说连部真要离开了，她谈了又谈，老舍不得走。她还打算请连长到她家去吃顿饭，当张连长婉言谢绝她的好意后，她还再三叮咛：“你们再来村里的时候，可到家坐坐。”
    现在，四季青蔬菜生产合作社邀请六连春节联欢的请柬来了，不但战士们个个欢喜，张连长心里也很想去看看黄庄的老乡们。
