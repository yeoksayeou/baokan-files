The Meixi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Linli County, Hunan Province, had a bumper harvest, and 92% of its members increased their income. However, not long ago, more than 120 households in this cooperative went out to engage in their own sideline production or business. The cooperative's winter production slackened.

What was the reason for this? The main reason was that the cooperative delayed the distribution of sideline income. Although it was eventually distributed, most members received more goods and less cash, and some households that had previously overdrawn even received no cash. The cooperative also failed to purchase the fertilizer accumulated by the members' families in a timely manner.

After the Meixi Agricultural Cooperative branch of the Chinese Communist Party discovered this problem, they calculated the accounts of increased production, labor, and fertilizer for the members, helped the cooperative formulate a winter production plan, and adjusted the labor organization and labor quotas. The cooperative also made unified arrangements for collective sideline occupations and members' family sideline occupations, and decided to take out 230 yuan from the sideline income to lend to members with particularly difficult living conditions, and also prepared to withdraw 2,000 yuan for members to celebrate the Spring Festival. As a result, the members' emotions were stabilized, all the outgoing members returned, and the entire cooperative's winter production was enthusiastically launched.

The lack of cash to spend is a practical difficulty, and difficulties must always be overcome. When the cooperative's leadership does not worry about this difficulty of the members, the members will only worry about their own livelihood and disregard the collective production of the cooperative. Conversely, when the leadership shows more concern for the members' living difficulties, the members will worry less about their own livelihood and put more effort into the collective production of the cooperative.

    外出社员的归来
    湖南省临澧县梅溪农业生产合作社农业生产丰收了，92％的社员增加了收入。但是，不久以前这个社里却有一百二十多户社员外出进行自己的副业生产，或者做生意。合作社的冬季生产松弛起来了。
    这是什么缘故呢？主要原因是合作社拖延了副业收入的分配，后来虽然分配下去了，但是多数社员分的实物多、现钱少，有些过去超支的农户甚至没有得到现钱。社员家里积的肥料，合作社也没有及时作价收买。
    中共梅溪农业社分支部发现了这个问题以后，向社员们算了增产、劳力、肥料等方面的账，帮助合作社订出了冬季生产计划，调整了劳动组织和劳动定额。合作社还统一安排集体副业和社员家庭副业，并且决定从副业收入里拿出二百三十元借给生活特别困难的社员，还准备抽出两千元给社员过春节。这样，社员的情绪安定了，外出的社员全部回来了，全社的冬季生产热烈地展开了。
    缺少现钱花，是个实际困难，而困难总得设法克服。当着合作社领导方面不替社员的这个困难操心的时候，社员们就会光为自己的生计操心，而把社里的集体生产撇下不管；反之，当着领导方面对于社员的生活困难表现了更多的关心的时候，社员们就会少为自己的生计操心，而多向合作社的集体生产上使劲。
