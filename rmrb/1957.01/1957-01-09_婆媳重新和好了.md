In the Xinqiu Coal Mine in Fuxin, people are spreading the story of a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationship that had been broken for five years being reconciled.

In the spring of 1948, nineteen-year-old Tong Guizhen married Zhao Lianchi, a miner. Zhao Lianchi's mother, Aunt Zhao, had a disabled hand and difficulty walking. Getting a daughter-in-law to help, she was happy every day. At that time, the old miner Zhao Weijia was still working in the mine. Half a year after his son's marriage, he was transferred to the Gaode Mine, and the old lady went with him. In the winter of 1950, Zhao Weijia retired and returned to his son's home from the Gaode Mine. By this time, Tong Guizhen had given birth to her first child. Because the house was small and couldn't accommodate everyone, the whole family moved to the west courtyard of Tong Guizhen's parents' home. After moving, the old lady suddenly discovered that two of her beloved Jiangxi porcelain plates were missing and said, "Such good things, gone just like that." This sentence made the daughter-in-law suspicious, and the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law started arguing, word for word, until Zhao Lianchi returned from work. From then on, there was a rift between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Even a small matter would lead to quarrels, and the relationship deteriorated. The daughter-in-law thought that her life was going well, and this old burden had been added, not only having to serve her every day but also being controlled by her. So, she demanded that Zhao Lianchi separate from the old woman. Zhao Lianchi disagreed, so she threatened divorce. Neighbors and the government tried to mediate, but it didn't work. Tong Guizhen didn't cook properly every day. The old lady's teeth were bad and she couldn't eat hard food, but she deliberately made it hard. The old lady was so worried that she cried and had no choice but to cook for herself. Although the family lived in the same house, no one paid attention to anyone else. Neighbors said that the Zhao family had no other option but to separate.

Zhao Lianchi was also worried about the family affairs while working, and he was listless all day. Once, he accidentally got an electric shock and rested for four months, nearly losing his life. Tong Guizhen saw the harm of family discord from her husband's accident. The union chairman often came to persuade her. Thus, Tong Guizhen's thinking began to change, and she didn't treat the old woman like an enemy as before. However, she still didn't talk to her mother-in-law.

Last June, the union organized a family liaison meeting, educating family members to serve their spouses well, take care of the elderly and children, and rewarded outstanding family members. Tong Guizhen was unexpectedly elected as the family group leader at the meeting. After the meeting, she watched the play "Household Affairs." Tong Guizhen felt that it was just like her own family. The family members watching the play commented, "Look! That woman is so wicked, lazy to work, and bullies her mother-in-law!" Although this was not said about her, she felt her face burning. After watching the play, she felt very heavy. When she returned home, she said to her husband, "This time, I must change!"

After being elected as the family group leader, Tong Guizhen's thinking became more open. She always wanted to talk to her mother-in-law, but she hadn't spoken for three or four years, and it was difficult to open her mouth all of a sudden, so she always wanted to find an opportunity. One day, the old lady was cooking porridge in a small pot. She saw this as an opportunity and turned around and said, "Mom! Your small pot is always bubbling over. Use my big pot!" The old lady had also wanted to talk to her daughter-in-law for a long time, but she always felt embarrassed. This time, seeing her daughter-in-law speaking, she was happy. She hurriedly said, "Put it there! Put it there!" In the evening, the son and daughter-in-law came to the old lady's room and asked to cook together from now on. The old lady shed tears and said, "We are so old, we don't know what tomorrow will bring. What can we do if we leave our children? Isn't it good to live together?" From then on, the whole family ate together again. The old lady's teeth were bad, so the daughter-in-law tried to make the food softer. The old lady's quilt hadn't been washed for several years, so Tong Guizhen took it over and washed it clean. Tong Guizhen had many children and didn't have time to study, so the old lady said, "I'll take care of the children for you, you go study!"

In December, Tong Guizhen was named an advanced family member of the Xinqiu Mine and then was named a "Five-Good" family member of Fuxin City and received a reward. Zhao Lianchi unloaded the burden in his mind, had energy at work, and also received a reward. Every evening, the house, which used to be dull and suffocating, was filled with laughter. The neighbors happily said: "The old Zhao family has really changed!"

    婆媳重新和好了
    电明
    在阜新新丘煤矿里，人们传颂着一个破裂五年之久的婆媳关系又重新和好的故事。
    1948年春天，十九岁的佟桂珍和矿工赵连池结了婚。赵连池的母亲赵大娘一只手残废，腿也不好使，娶了儿媳妇有了替手，每天乐得闭不上嘴。那时老矿工赵维甲还在矿里工作，在儿子结婚后半年，被调到高德矿工作，老太太也随着去了。1950年冬天，赵维甲退休养老了，就从高德矿搬回到儿子家来。这时，佟桂珍已生了第一个孩子，因为房子小，住不下，全家就搬到佟桂珍娘家的西院去住。搬完家后，老太太忽然发现自己两个心爱的江西瓷碟子不见了，就说：“那么好的东西说丢就丢了。”这一句话使媳妇多心起来，于是婆媳俩就你一句我一语吵起来，一直吵到赵连池下班回来才停息。从此婆媳之间有了隔阂，有一点小事，也要吵架，关系越闹越坏。媳妇想，自己日子过得好好的，多了这个老累赘，天天侍候她还不算，还得让她管着。于是就要赵连池和老人分家，赵连池不同意，她就闹离婚，邻居劝说、政府调解，都不行。佟桂珍每天做饭也不好好做，老太太牙口不好，吃不了硬的，她就偏做硬的。老太太愁的直哭，没办法，只好硬着头皮自己做饭。一家人虽然住在一幢房子里，可是谁也不理谁。邻居都说，老赵家除了分家，没有别的办法了。
    赵连池在工作时也挂念着家里的事，整天无精打彩。有一次不小心触了电，休养了四个月，险些丧了命。佟桂珍从这次丈夫的事故中看出了家庭不和睦的害处，工会主席又经常来劝说她，这样，佟桂珍思想开始有些改变，对老人不像先前那样当仇人一样了。可是跟婆婆还是不说话。
    去年6月，工会组织了家属联系会，教育家属要侍好爱人，照顾好老人和孩子，并奖励了优秀的家属。佟桂珍在会上出乎意料地被选为家属小组长。会后看剧——“家务事”，佟桂珍越看越像自己家里，看剧的家属们议论说：“看！那个妇女多歪，自己懒作活，还欺负老婆婆！”这句话虽然不是说她，可是她却感到脸上发烧。看完剧，心里很沉重，回到家就对丈夫说：“这回我可得变了！”
    佟桂珍被选上家属小组长后，思想更加开通了，总想跟婆婆说话，可是三、四年没有说过话，一下子也难张口，总想找个机会。有一天，老太太正用小锅熬粥，她一看这是机会，就转过身来说道：“妈！看你使小锅老冒出来，用我这个大锅吧！”老太太也早想跟媳妇说话，可是总觉得不好意思。这回看到媳妇说话了，心也乐了。忙说：“放那吧！放那吧！”晚上，儿子、媳妇来到老太太房里，要求以后一起做饭吃。老太太掉下眼泪说道：“我们这么大岁数了，有今天没明天，离开孩子过个啥呀，一起过还不好吗？”从此，全家老少又在一起作饭吃了。老太太牙口不好，媳妇就想办法把饭菜做得烂一些。老太太的被子好几年没洗了，佟桂珍就抱过去给拆洗得干干净净。佟桂珍孩子多，没空去学习，老太太就说：“我给你看孩子，你去学习吧！”
    12月，佟桂珍被评为新丘矿的先进家属，接着又被评为阜新市的
  “五好”家属，受到了奖励。赵连池在思想上卸下了包袱，工作有了劲，也受到了奖励。每天晚间，过去沉闷呕气的屋子里，传出了阵阵欢笑的声音。邻居们都高兴地说：
  “老赵家真变样了！”
