U.S. "Aid" Cannot Solve Western Europe's Oil Shortage
Wei Shensan

Since Britain, France, and Israel launched their invasion of Egypt, Western Europe has faced a serious oil shortage. Although the United States has already begun implementing its so-called emergency oil aid plan, materials revealed in Western newspapers indicate that the Western European oil shortage cannot be resolved in the short term.

I.

Due to the rapid development of industry and transportation, the importance of oil is increasing day by day. Oil consumption in capitalist countries has doubled on average in the past decade, while in Western Europe it has tripled. Many factories in Europe use oil instead of coal as fuel. For example, the number of factories in Britain currently using oil as fuel has doubled since 1952, and oil consumption in industry accounts for 42% of the country's total oil consumption.

Western Europe's own oil production is very low, only enough for 5% of its needs, so it must import large amounts of oil from abroad—mainly from the Middle East. According to a report published by the United Nations Statistical Office on December 12, 1956, among Western European countries, Portugal obtains 100% of its crude oil from the Middle East, Italy and France 94%, Belgium and Luxembourg 93%, West Germany 88%, Britain 84%, Sweden 82%, and the Netherlands 61%.

At the start of the invasion of Egypt, Western European countries generally had oil reserves sufficient for only two to three months. Therefore, countries began to reduce their oil consumption. The reduction in oil supply not only affected transportation but also seriously affected industry. For example, a 10% reduction in Britain's oil supply has already reduced steel production by 15,000 tons per week. The decline in production will also create more unemployment. British trade union leaders have predicted that the number of unemployed in Britain will soon double, reaching 500,000. The U.S. "Business Week" also pointed out that if the Western European oil shortage cannot be resolved soon, Western European industry will regress to the level of two and a half years ago, with production falling by 15%, and 4.5 million people will face the risk of being laid off.

II.

The invasion of Egypt blocked the Suez Canal, and the oil pipeline of the Iraq Petroleum Company was cut, depriving Western European countries of their normal sources of oil supply.

There are a total of 49 sunken ships in the Suez Canal, and Western newspapers estimate that it will take six months to a year to clear them all. A press release issued by Wheeler, the United Nations representative assisting Egypt in clearing the Suez Canal, on December 30, 1956, also stated that the canal clearance work will be carried out in three stages, and the second stage will not be completed until May of this year.

The extent of the damage to the three pumping stations in Syria along the oil pipeline from Iraq to the eastern Mediterranean coast is severe. According to Western newspapers' estimates, the complete restoration of these three pumping stations will take at least six months.

Therefore, the only way for Western European countries to obtain oil from the Middle East at present, besides the 325,000 tons per day obtainable through the ARAMCO oil pipeline, is to rely on tankers to transport oil around the Cape of Good Hope. However, due to the rapid growth in oil consumption in recent years, capitalist countries felt that there was a shortage of tankers even before the invasion of Egypt, and the transportation capacity will be reduced by 40% after tankers detour around the Cape of Good Hope. In order to solve the tanker shortage, Western countries are clamoring to build a large number of tankers. However, the three largest tanker manufacturing countries in the world, Britain, West Germany, and Japan, have already filled their tanker manufacturing order books until after 1960, and cannot accept any new orders in the near future. The tankers currently under construction in various shipyards are estimated to be completed by 1961, which is a drop in the bucket for solving the current transportation problem. The United States, which accounts for only 2.5% of the total tonnage in the capitalist world's tanker manufacturing industry, is even less capable of solving the tanker shortage. As for the Western countries' extravagant talk of manufacturing a large number of 60,000-ton supertankers to solve the oil transportation problem, it is even more unrealistic. Some European and American newspapers have pointed out that although there are five shipyards in the United States that can build large tankers, it will take more than a year to build just the first one; moreover, Western Europe does not even have ports that can accommodate 60,000-ton large tankers.

Western countries also boast that the United States has a large fleet of reserve ships that can help Western Europe solve the oil shortage transportation problem. However, according to a recent report in the British "Economist," the U.S. "Mothball" fleet only has 2,000 old "Liberty" and "Victory" type freighters, which can only be used to transport things like grain and coal. Although there are a few old T-2 type small tankers left over from World War II in the reserve fleet, they must be repaired for a period of time before they can go to sea.

In this situation, Western European countries have appealed to the United States for help in solving the oil shortage problem. In order to make a fortune by selling oil and further control Western European countries economically and politically, the United States has agreed to supply Western Europe with extra oil. But in fact, there are some insurmountable difficulties in using American oil to solve Western Europe's oil shortage, and it is not as easy as generally imagined.

III.

How much more oil can the United States produce at present? "U.S. News & World Report" once boasted that it could increase production by 2.2 million barrels per day. The U.S. "Business Week" estimates are lower: 1.5 million barrels per day, of which Texas will increase production by 1 million barrels per day; Louisiana by 300,000 barrels per day; Oklahoma by 125,000 barrels per day; and New Mexico by 45,000 barrels per day. However, the British "Economist" of December 8 last year pointed out that even the lower estimate of the U.S. "Business Week" is exaggerated. Louisiana's daily increase in production is not 300,000 barrels but 200,000 barrels, Oklahoma is not 125,000 barrels but 45,000 barrels, and Texas is not 1 million barrels but only 75,000 barrels.

According to more realistic estimates by some American economists, the United States cannot increase its daily oil production by more than 750,000 barrels. "New York Times" oil expert Kamiko recently admitted that the United States can only increase its daily production by 700,000 barrels without affecting its own economy, Venezuela can only increase its daily production by a maximum of 50,000 barrels, and Canada can only increase its daily production by 25,000 barrels. Of these increased oil production, 350,000 barrels will have to be set aside to make up for the oil that North America imported from the Middle East every day before the outbreak of the invasion of Egypt.

Not only that, but the difficulties in oil transportation in the United States are more serious than the difficulties in oil production increases. Oil shipped from the United States to Western Europe must first be transported from the oil-producing states to the Gulf of Mexico. According to U.S. newspaper estimates, even if the United States increases its existing oil pipeline transportation capacity and expands other transportation equipment, it can at most transport 800,000 barrels of oil per day to the Gulf of Mexico.

According to the "action plan" announced by the U.S. government to solve the Western European oil shortage, the United States ships only 500,000 barrels of oil from the Gulf of Mexico to Western Europe every day. According to recent estimates by "New York Times" oil expert Kamiko, Western Europe needs to import 1.25 million barrels of oil from the United States every day to fully meet its needs. Therefore, Western Europe currently lacks 750,000 barrels of oil per day, which is about 25% of its normal daily requirement (3 million barrels) before the outbreak of the invasion of Egypt.

The situation is very clear: Western Europe's oil shortage cannot be resolved in the short term. Arthur Fleming, director of the U.S. Defense Mobilization Agency, said: "As long as the Suez Canal remains blocked and the oil pipeline has not been repaired, this shortage cannot be overcome."

    美国的“援助”解决不了西欧石油荒
    卫慎三
    自从英法和以色列发动侵埃战争以后，西欧就面临严重的石油荒。虽然目前美国已经开始执行所谓石油援助的紧急计划，但是从西方国家报刊上所透露的一些材料中可以看出，西欧石油荒在短期内是不可能得到解决的。
    一
    由于工业和交通运输业的迅速发展，石油的重要性也一天比一天增加。资本主义国家石油消费量在过去十年中平均增加了一倍，而西欧却增加了两倍。欧洲的许多工厂都用石油来代替煤作燃料，例如英国目前使用石油作燃料的工厂就比1952年增加了一倍，石油在工业中的消费量占国内石油总消费量的42％。
    西欧本身石油产量很低，只够所需的5％，因此必须从国外——主要是中东输入大量石油。根据联合国统计局1956年12月12日发表的报告，西欧国家中，葡萄牙的原油100％取自中东，意大利和法国94％，比利时和卢森堡93％，西德88％，英国84％，瑞典82％，荷兰61％。
    侵埃战争开始时，西欧国家的石油贮存一般只够两三个月之用，因此各国就纷纷削减它们的石油消费量。石油供应减少后不仅影响交通运输业，而且还严重影响了工业。例如英国削减10％的石油供应后，已经使钢铁产量每周减少了一万五千吨。生产下降又会造成更多的失业。英国工会领袖已经预料，英国失业人数不久将要增加一倍，达到五十万人。美国的“商业周刊”也指出，如果西欧石油荒迟迟不能解决，西欧工业将会退到两年半以前的水平，生产下降15％，有四百五十万人将面临被解雇的危险。
    二
    侵埃战争使得苏伊士运河被堵塞了，伊拉克石油公司的油管被割断了，西欧国家就失去了正常的石油供应来源。
    苏伊士运河中共有沉船四十九艘，西方报刊估计要半年到一年的时间才能清除完毕。联合国协助埃及清理苏伊士运河的代表惠勒在1956年12月30日发表的新闻公报也说，清理运河的工作将分三个阶段进行，而第二个阶段要到今年5月才能完成。
    从伊拉克通往地中海东岸的输油管，在叙利亚境内的三个抽油站破坏的程度很严重。据西方报刊的估计，这三个抽油站的全部修复，至少要六个月的时间。
    因此，目前西欧国家要从中东取得石油，除了通过阿美石油公司油管每天能够得到三十二万五千吨以外，就只能依靠用油船绕道好望角来运输。但是，由于近年来石油消费量的迅速增长，资本主义国家早在侵埃战争前就感到油船不够用，而油船绕道好望角后运输能力又要下降40％。为了解决油船荒，西方国家正在叫嚷要赶造大批油船。但是，世界上三个最大的油船制造国英国、西德和日本，制造油船的订货单早已排到了1960年以后，在最近期内根本不能接受什么新订货。目前各国造船厂中正在赶造的油船，估计要到1961年才能全部完工，对解决当前的运输问题是远水解不了近渴。而美国在资本主义世界油船制造业中所占总吨位只有2.5％，更解决不了油船荒的问题。至于某些西方国家侈谈要制造大批六万吨的超级油船来解决石油运输问题，更是不现实的。有些欧美报刊已经指出，虽然美国有五家造船厂可以制造大油船，但光是第一艘就得造一年多；而且目前西欧连能容六万吨大油船的港口也没有。
    西方国家还吹嘘美国有一支庞大的船只预备队，可以帮助西欧解决石油荒的运输问题。但据英国“经济学家”最近的报道，美国的“毛斯堡”（译音）预备队中只有两千艘陈旧的“自由”型和“胜利”型货船，它们只能用来装运一些谷物和煤之类的东西。虽然预备队中也有几艘二次大战中留下来的T—2型破旧小油船，但是它们必须经过一段时间的修理后才能出海。
    在这种情况下，西欧各国为了解决石油荒问题，就纷纷向美国哀求帮助。美国为了卖油发财，并且想借此在经济上和政治上进一步控制西欧各国，就同意供给西欧额外的石油。但是事实上，要用美国石油来解决西欧的石油荒，存在着一些不可克服的困难，并不像一般想像的那样轻而易举。
    三
    美国在目前能够增产多少石油呢？“美国新闻与世界报道”曾经吹嘘说，每天可以增产二百二十万桶。美国“商业周刊”的估计则要低一些：每天一百五十万桶，其中得克萨斯州每天增产一百万桶；路易斯安那州每天增产三十万桶；俄克拉何马州每天增产十二万五千桶；新墨西哥州每天增产四万五千桶。然而，去年12月8日的英国“经济学家”指出，连美国“商业周刊”这个比较低的估计也是夸大的。路易斯安那州的每天增产量不是三十万桶而是二十万桶，俄克拉何马州不是十二万五千桶而是四万五千桶，得克萨斯州不是一百万桶而仅仅是七万五千桶。
    根据有些美国经济学家比较现实的估计，美国每天增产的石油不可能超过七十五万桶。“纽约时报”石油专家卡密考最近也承认，美国在不影响本身的经济情况下，每天只能增产七十万桶，委内瑞拉每天最多只能增产五万桶，加拿大每天只能增产二万五千桶。这些增产的石油中，有三十五万桶还要留下来弥补北美在侵埃战争爆发前每天由中东进口的石油。
    不但如此，美国在石油运输上的困难比石油增产的困难还严重。从美国运往西欧的石油必须先从产油各州运到墨西哥湾。根据美国报刊的估计，即使美国加大现有的油管运输能力以及扩充其他运输设备，充其量也只能每天输送八十万桶石油到墨西哥湾。
    按照美国政府宣布的解决西欧石油荒的“行动计划”，美国每天从墨西哥湾运往西欧的石油只不过五十万桶。而据“纽约时报”石油专家卡密考最近的估计，西欧每天需要从美国输入一百二十五万桶石油才能完全满足它的需要。因此，西欧目前每天尚缺石油七十五万桶，约等于侵埃战争爆发前每天正常需要量（三百万桶）的25％。
    情况很清楚，西欧的石油荒在短期内是不可能解决的。美国国防动员署署长阿瑟·弗莱明说：“只要苏伊士运河仍然被堵塞，油管仍然没有修复，这种缺货的情形是不可能克服的。”
