    Carrying Out Fodder Grass Reserve Work and Vigorously Building Livestock Sheds
    The Phenomenon of Weakness and Death of Draft Animals in Disaster Areas of Hebei Improves
    According to the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture, the phenomenon of weakness and death of draft animals in the disaster areas of Hebei Province due to insufficient feed and lack of shelter has recently improved. In the severely affected areas of Cangxian Prefecture, such as Hejian and Suning counties, the mortality rate of draft animals has greatly decreased. Some draft animals that were originally too weak to be used have now become strong and able to work.
    Various localities have mobilized agricultural cooperative members to carry out fodder grass reserve work and vigorously build livestock sheds to protect draft animals through the winter. Farmers in Chicheng County have stored more than 47.7 million catties of fodder grass by collecting and gathering wild grass and expanding the utilization of straw, which is enough for draft animals to eat until new grass grows. Shangdu, Guyuan and other counties have built more than 100,000 livestock sheds, which can accommodate more than 200,000 draft animals for the winter. More than 90% of the 20,000 livestock sheds that collapsed due to floods in Xingtai Prefecture have now been repaired. Various localities have also strengthened education on animal protection and love for animals among agricultural cooperative members, and have formulated regular inspection, evaluation, visits, and model selection systems in animal protection work.
    The state has strongly supported animal protection work in disaster areas. Transportation departments in various localities have given priority to organizing draft animals in disaster areas to engage in sideline transportation, and the number of draft animals put into transportation throughout the province has reached more than 100,000, achieving animal-raising-animal or animal-raising-people. In addition, in December of last year, the state also allocated more than 5.7 million yuan of draft animal relief funds and forage allocation loss subsidies. At the same time, a large number of folk veterinarians were organized to tour various disaster areas to provide free medical treatment.

    开展储备饲草工作大力修盖耕畜棚
    河北灾区耕畜瘦弱死亡现象好转
    据河北省农业厅了解，河北省灾区耕畜因草料不足和住所缺少而瘦弱死亡的现象最近有了好转。沧县专区河间、肃宁等县重灾区，耕畜死亡率已经大大下降；有些原来瘦弱得不能使用的耕畜，现在开始健壮起来能够干活了。
    各地发动了农业社社员开展储备饲草工作，大力修盖耕畜棚，以保护耕畜过冬。赤城县农民用打、搂黄草和扩大秸秆利用范围的办法，贮备了四千七百多万斤饲草，足够耕畜吃到新草生长的时候。商都、沽源等县已经修好耕畜棚十万多间，可以容纳二十多万头耕畜过冬。邢台专区因为水灾倒塌的两万多间耕畜棚，目前已经修复90％以上。各地还对农业社社员加强了保畜、爱畜的教育，并且在保畜工作中制定了定期检查、评比、参观、评模等制度。
    国家大力支持了灾区的保畜工作。各地交通运输部门都优先组织灾区耕畜搞起运输副业，全省投入运输的耕畜，曾达到十万头以上，做到了以畜养畜或以畜养人。另外，在去年12月，国家还拨发了五百七十多万元的耕畜救济款和草料调拨亏损补助费。同时，组织大批民间兽医巡回在各灾区实行免费医疗。
