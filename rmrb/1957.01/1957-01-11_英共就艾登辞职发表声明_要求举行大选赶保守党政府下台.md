Xinhua News Agency, London, January 10th. The Communist Party of Great Britain issued a statement on Eden's resignation. The statement said: "Eden has fallen—now, the entire Conservative government must also fall!"

The statement said: "The reckless adventure undertaken by the entire Conservative Party on the Suez Canal issue has brought tragic consequences to Britain. The full impact of this adventure is now beginning to manifest itself, and public anger towards those who should be held responsible is growing."

The statement went on to point out that only by launching a large-scale, united anti-Conservative movement led by the Labor Party can they force an immediate general election and bring about the complete defeat of the Conservatives.

It said: "This is what the Conservative leaders fear. They are sacrificing Eden, hoping that the government itself can continue to govern, but the Conservative Party's policies have not changed. The Conservatives still intend to make the working people bear the costs of the Suez War. They will continue to raise prices, cut wages, cause more unemployment, and continue to implement their plans to increase the rents of millions of tenants."

The statement said: "Now is the time to awaken the people of the country through mass rallies, demonstrations and various actions, demand a general election, and unite the workers of the country and all progressive forces to support a policy of peace and social progress."

The statement called on Communists and Labor to take action to drive the Conservatives out of power and make the petition to Parliament on January 22nd the strongest expression of the will of the people.

    英共就艾登辞职发表声明
    要求举行大选赶保守党政府下台
    新华社伦敦10日电　英国共产党就艾登辞职发表声明。声明说：“艾登下台了——现在，整个保守党政府也必须下台！”
    声明说：“整个保守党应该负责的在苏伊士运河问题上进行的疯狂的冒险已经给英国带来了悲惨的后果。这种冒险的全部影响现在开始表现出来，公众对那些应该负责的人们的愤怒情绪日益高涨。”
    声明接着指出，只要展开一个以工党为首的、声势浩大的团结一致的反保守党运动，就能迫使立即举行大选和使保守党人彻底溃败。
    它说：“这就是保守党领袖们所害怕的。他们牺牲艾登，希望政府本身能够继续执政，但是保守党的政策并没有改变。保守党人仍然打算使劳动人民负担苏伊士战争的费用。他们将使物价继续上涨，削减工资，使更多的人失业，继续执行他们的增加千百万房客的租金的计划。”
    声明说：“现在是时候了，应当通过大规模的集会、示威和各种行动来唤醒全国人民，要求举行大选和把全国的工人和一切进步力量团结起来支持和平和社会进步的政策。”
    声明要求共产党人和劳工采取行动，把保守党人赶下台，使全国在1月22日到议会去请愿的行动成为人民意志的最强有力的表示。
