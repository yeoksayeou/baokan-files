Title: Stepmother

　　Before the New Year, I went to my uncle's house to play. My little sister danced her braids and was affectionate with me for a while, then twisted my hand and sang:
　　“Little cabbage is yellow in the field, three or two years without a mother. Follow Daddy and live a good life, just afraid Daddy will marry a stepmother…”
　　In the childish singing, a deeper color was increasingly applied. The singer frowned, her big eyes were wet, and from those clear eyes, it could be clearly seen that this child had understood the meaning of the lyrics, was imagining the pain of the orphan and the cruelty of the stepmother according to her own thinking ability, and expressed sympathy and revealed hatred without stint. My sister's song led me into chaotic memories, making me painful and indignant, not because I had a childhood fate of losing my mother, but because I felt that there was still some indiscriminate scourge of stepmothers in society to this day.

　　When I was a child, I also liked to hum the song "Little Cabbage." At that time, I had already formed a prejudice: stepmothers are always cruel, at least not as good as biological mothers.

　　Sixteen years ago, my mother died, leaving behind my brother and me, who was just seven years old. Soon, a kind working woman became our stepmother. According to prejudice, we routinely thought this was a second misfortune. Everything after that would probably be like the process experienced by many similar families, with everything going wrong and the whole family disharmonious.

　　But my mother was thrifty. In addition to cooking three meals a day by herself, she also took care of all the needlework for the whole family, washing and scrubbing from morning till night. Although the family was poor, my mother could always prepare our cotton clothes when winter came. Clearly seeing that we were wearing warm clothes, some gossiping neighbors, especially the ladies in those big red gatehouses, still felt our clothes, saying they were thin and old, picking on my mother’s faults. We, in our naiveté, thought we were really wronged.

　　We had a little brother. What a lovely little brother! But this child did not receive any special treatment. Like us, he chewed sorghum, millet, and coarse flour steamed buns.

　　My brother grew up and married a sister-in-law. A mother-in-law and a daughter-in-law were originally not "close," and with a "stepmother," they became even less "close." So, they set up a separate kitchen. My brother's house was nearby, you could say “the sounds of chickens and dogs could be heard from each other,” but the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law "did not interact" all year round. Even so, quarrels over trivial matters of life were inevitable, and each time, my mother was always subjected to unfair ridicule.

　　My mother's back was hunched, her hair was white, and she suffered from rheumatism. Those calloused hands still worked tirelessly. But in the mouths of those gossiping neighbors and the ladies in the big red gatehouses, my mother was still a "step" mother, always comparing her to the mean "second wives" of wealthy families.

　　But my mother was kind after all, the clothes I wore were warm after all, and the love of a慈母 would always melt icy prejudice. One night, I was asleep when suddenly a few drops of water fell on my forehead. I woke up and saw my mother sitting beside me, mending my clothes, old tears hanging on her wrinkled face. At that time, I was so painful and so happy. My nose felt sore, my eyes were wet, and I sobbed and called out "Mom." She hurriedly turned her head away and wiped away her tears. We looked at each other and couldn’t say a word. I was so sympathetic and loved her so much. From that time on, we went through the difficult days that followed as close as blood relatives. My temperament also became cheerful, and my body and mind developed healthily. At the age of sixteen, I joined the People's Liberation Army and was already an adult who could distinguish right from wrong. Because I maintained a clear filial love for my mother, and because my father's life improved after joining the commune, my mother became even more thrifty and happier than before.

　　The Spring Festival is approaching again. My mother wrote to instruct me to go home for the New Year, and as usual, she asked about my well-being, every sentence warm and kind.

　　Dear readers, when you hear stories about stepmothers loving their stepchildren, you often conclude that these are new people and new things in the new society. If someone tells you that even in the past, there were some kind working women who treated children with similar fates as their own flesh and blood, wouldn't you agree that this is reasonable? Don't indiscriminately talk badly about stepmothers, because perhaps right next to you, a kind woman is suffering injustice because of your unfair words.

    继母
    礼褒仪
    年前，我到叔叔家去玩。小妹妹舞着小辫子和我亲热了一阵，就扭着我的手唱了起来：
    “小白菜呀地里黄，三岁两岁没有娘。跟着爹爹好好过，就怕爹爹娶后娘……”
    稚气的歌声中，越来越浓厚的涂上了深沉的色彩。唱歌的人皱着眉，大眼睛是湿润的，从那对明澄的眸子中可以明白地看出，这个孩子已经理解了歌词的含义，正按自己的思维能力，设想着孤儿的痛苦、后娘的狠毒，毫不吝啬地表达了同情，流露了憎恨。妹妹的歌引我走入杂乱的回忆，使我痛苦愤慨，这不是因为自己曾有着一段早年失母的命运，而是因为我觉得社会上直到现在还多少存在的那种无分别的鞭笞继母的舆论。
    我小的时候，也喜欢哼哼“小白菜”这首歌，那时，我已经形成了一个偏见：继母总是狠毒的，起码不比亲娘好。
    十六年前，妈妈死去了，抛下了哥哥和刚刚七岁的我。不久，一个善良的劳动妇女，做了我们的继母。按照成见，我们照例认为这是第二个不幸。以后的一切，大概要像常见的许多类似家庭所经历的过程一样，处处不顺心，全家不和睦。
    可是母亲是勤俭的，除了每日三餐要亲手做以外，还包揽了全家大小的针线活，洗洗涮涮从早忙到晚。家境虽然困难，冬天一到，母亲也总能把我们的棉衣准备停当。明明看到我们穿得很暖，但一些碎嘴的邻居特别是那些大红门楼里的太太们，还是摸着我们的衣服，薄呀旧呀的，挑剔母亲的不是，幼稚的我们，也就以为自己真的受了委屈。
    我们有了小弟弟。那是多么可爱的小弟弟啊！可是，这孩子并没有得到什么特殊的待遇，同我们一样，大口嚼着高粱、小米、粗面馍馍。
    哥哥大了，娶了嫂嫂。婆婆和媳妇，原就不“亲”，摊上个“后婆婆”，就更加“不亲”了。于是，他们另立了灶火门。哥哥家就在附近，可谓“鸡犬之声相闻”，但婆媳之间却终年“不相往来”。即使如此，也不免因生活琐事而发生争吵，而每次争吵，母亲总是受到不公正的奚落。
    母亲的背驼了，发白了，患了风湿症。那双起茧的手还是不停歇的劳动。但是，在那些碎嘴邻居和大红门楼里的太太底嘴里，我的母亲，依然是“后”母，总把她同那些有钱人家的刻薄的“续弦”相提并论。
    但是，母亲毕竟是善良的，我身上的衣服毕竟是暖的，慈母般的爱总会融化冰样的成见。一天夜里，我已入睡，忽然几滴水珠落在我的额上，醒来一看，母亲就坐在我的身边，给我补着衣服，在刻着皱纹的面颊上，挂着老泪。当时我是那样的痛苦，又是那样的幸福，鼻子酸了，眼睛湿润了，我抽搐地喊声妈妈，她忙扭过头去，揩干眼泪。我们相视着说不出一句话，我是那样的同情她和热爱她。从那时起，我们就以骨肉般的母子关系，亲密无间地挨过了以后的苦难的日子。我的性情也开朗了，身心在健康的发展。十六岁那年，我参加了解放军，已经是一个能够辨别是非曲直的大人了，由于我对母亲保持了明确的儿女的爱，由于父亲入社后生活在改善，我的母亲，比以前更加勤俭了，也更加愉快了。
    春节又快到了，母亲来信嘱咐我回去过年，又照常问寒问暖，句句热情亲切。
    亲爱的读者们，当你们听到有关继母疼爱前子的故事时，常常断定说那是新社会里的新人新事。假如有谁告诉你们，即使在过去的日子，也有些善良的劳动妇女，把同命运的孩子当作亲骨肉来疼爱，你们不会否认这是合乎情理的吧？不要无分别的乱讲继母的坏话吧，也许就在你的身边，一个善良的女人正因你的不公正的话而受了委屈。
