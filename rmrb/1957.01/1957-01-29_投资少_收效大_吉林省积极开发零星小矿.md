Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, January 28th. Small mineral deposits that were previously considered not worth exploiting are now being developed by local industrial departments in a guided and organized manner, which plays a significant role in supporting national construction and improving the lives of local people.

In Jilin Province, the eleven small mines that were exploited last year all involved small investments and yielded great returns. Last year, the Industry Section of Yitong County organized local unemployed workers to produce over 800 tons of iron-manganese powder for the petroleum industry's desulfurization process. The prospecting cost less than 100 yuan, but it created great value. After deducting wages of 10,000 yuan, it still turned over 5,000 yuan to the state. In the past, Shuangyang County used coal that was transported from Changchun, with transportation costs of 40 yuan per ton. However, by organizing unemployed miners in the county to mine coal from local small coal mines, the cost per ton was less than 20 yuan. Therefore, the county's fuel shortage problem has been greatly alleviated compared to the past.

This year, in addition to increasing the production of already exploited small mines, Jilin Province will also exploit seven more small mines according to the needs of the state. Yitong County plans to build a small iron smelting furnace with an annual output of 10,000 tons near an iron mine in the county, using indigenous methods to smelt iron and solve the state's shortage of iron oxide. Panshi, Ji'an, Huinan counties, and the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture have also decided to use indigenous methods to produce coke and extract sulfur from local mineral resources, to supply the needs of the national smelting, rubber, paper-making and other industrial sectors.

Currently, there are about 46 types of minerals in Jilin Province, both old and newly discovered, totaling more than 240 deposits. Except for a few types that are exploited by the state, most of these resources are scattered small mines. However, these mineral resources with small reserves are needed for national construction. Therefore, after research by relevant departments, it is believed that under the condition of not damaging national resources, these small mines can be exploited and managed by the provincial and county local industrial departments in a guided manner.

This year, the Jilin Provincial Department of Industry also plans to organize a certain amount of technical personnel to help small mines operated by various counties to carry out technical transformation, so as to achieve rational and effective utilization of these resources.

### 投资少　收效大  吉林省积极开发零星小矿

    投资少　收效大
    吉林省积极开发零星小矿
    新华社长春28日电　过去认为没有开采价值的小矿藏，由地方工业部门有领导有组织地进行开采，对支援国家建设和改善当地人民群众生活，作用很大。
    吉林省在去年开采的十一处小矿，都是投资很少，收效很大。伊通县工业科去年组织当地失业工人为石油工业部门生产了八百多吨脱硫用的铁锰粉，花去不到一百元的探矿费，却创造了很大的价值，除去工资开支一万元以外，还上缴给国家五千元。过去双阳县用煤，都是从长春运去的，一吨煤需要四十元运费，而组织本县失业矿工从当地小煤矿中开采的煤，每吨成本不到二十元。因此这个县城镇缺乏燃料的困难比过去大大减轻了。
    今年，吉林省除增加已经开采的小矿产量以外，还将根据国家需要另开采七处小矿。伊通县计划在本县一个铁矿附近，建立一个年产一万吨的小炼铁炉用土法炼铁，解决国家氧化铁不足的困难。盘石、辑安、辉南三个县和延边朝鲜族自治州，也决定采用土法，从当地矿产资源中进行炼焦和提炼硫磺，供应国家冶炼、橡胶、造纸等工业部门需要。
    目前，这个省旧有和新发现的各种矿物有四十六种约二百四十多处。这些资源中除少数几种由国家开采以外，大多数都是零星分散的小矿，但是这些埋藏量很少的矿产资源，又为国家建设所需要。因此经过有关部门研究，认为在不破坏国家资源条件下，这些小矿可以由省、县地方工业部门有领导地进行开采、经营。
    吉林省工业厅今年还计划组织一定技术力量，帮助各县经营的小矿进行技术改造，达到合理有效地利用这些资源。
