    Set More Examples

    After reading "The Frugal and Simple Director Su" (December 21, 1956, page 2), I was deeply moved. His spirit and style of hard work and simplicity, willingness to help others, and always thinking of saving for the country is a model for me to learn from. At the same time, I hope the newspaper will, while exposing extravagance and waste, and the lack of cherishing state property and other undesirable phenomena, publish more deeds of frugality and simplicity, and practicing economy, and set more examples, so that the broad masses of cadres and young people can emulate them in their work and life.

    多树立榜样
    看了“勤俭朴素的苏局长”（1956年12月21日二版）后，我很受感动。他那艰苦朴素、乐于帮助别人、处处为国家节约着想的品质与作风是我学习的榜样。同时我希望报纸在揭露铺张浪费、不爱惜国家资财等不良现象的同时，多刊登些勤俭朴素、厉行节约的事迹，多树立榜样，使广大干部和青年在工作和生活中向他们看齐。
