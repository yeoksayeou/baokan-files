Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 18th, via TASS: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union have issued a letter to agricultural workers, local organizations, and all agricultural workers, calling on them to strive for further achievements in agricultural production in 1957.

The CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers pointed out that inspired by the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Soviet working people, under the leadership of the Party, achieved great successes in developing industry and agriculture last year. The production of agricultural products in the Soviet Union increased last year. In this regard, the reclamation of 35.5 million hectares of wasteland was of decisive significance, enabling the Soviet Union to greatly increase its total grain harvest and reserves last year. In the past few years, the national procurement of 2 to 2.2 billion poods of grain was considered a great achievement. However, last year, agricultural workers sold more than 3.3 billion poods of grain to the state. In addition, the production and procurement of cotton, sugar beets, vegetables, and potatoes also increased significantly. The procurement of raw cotton alone increased by 481,000 tons compared to 1955. Due to the outstanding achievements in reclaiming wasteland, increasing grain and cotton production, and fulfilling the annual plan for delivering these two agricultural products to the state, the republics of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan, as well as the Altai, Krasnoyarsk, and Omsk regions and provinces of the Russian Federation, were awarded the Order of Lenin. At the same time, more than 90,000 agricultural workers in the reclaimed areas received government awards.

Significant achievements have also been made in the development of animal husbandry, especially in milk production. Last year, the total milk production of collective farms throughout the Soviet Union almost doubled compared to 1953. From 1945 to 1953, the average milk yield per cow in collective farms nationwide increased by only 67 kilograms, while in the 1955-1956 economic year, it increased by 337 kilograms. The annual plan for milk procurement and purchase was completed far ahead of schedule, with 28% more milk delivered to the state than in 1955. Last year, the Soviet Union's animal oil production increased by 20% compared to 1955, and by 45% compared to 1953. In the development of meat production, collective farms raised approximately 9 million pigs last year, more than double the number in 1955. Last year, the state procured and purchased 9% more livestock from all sources than in 1955.

In recent years, the work of Soviet state farms has also improved. Their deliveries of grain, milk, potatoes, vegetables, and other products to the state have increased year by year. Last year, they delivered 933 million poods of grain to the state, approximately three times the amount in 1955.

The letter stated that all these facts and figures demonstrate the immense potential and resources of our great, highly mechanized socialist agriculture. However, far from all collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms, and far from all regions, have fully utilized the existing opportunities to further increase agricultural production last year. The letter then detailed many shortcomings in agricultural production in various regions.

The letter stated that the CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers believe that if 1956 was the beginning of successfully completing the task of increasing agricultural production as stipulated in the Sixth Five-Year Plan, then 1957 can and should be a year of turning point in the further development of all agricultural sectors.

The letter stated that every district, every collective farm, and state farm must, based on an assessment of all possibilities and potentials, formulate a comprehensive plan to complete the agricultural production tasks stipulated in the Sixth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. It is necessary to further improve the leadership level of Party, Soviet, and agricultural organs in agriculture, enhance the enthusiasm of collective farm members for the public economy, strengthen labor discipline, and increase labor productivity in order to solve the task of completing the Sixth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

The letter criticized the recent lack of attention paid by some Party organizations and Soviet leaders to the selection and strengthening of leading cadres in collective farms and state farms, and demanded that collective farm chairmen discipline and severely punish those who do not treat their work sincerely and evade work. In order to further enhance the enthusiasm of collective farm members in the collective economy and strengthen labor discipline, the CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers also required each collective farm to carefully study the attitude of those collective farm members who evade work in the collective economy under various pretexts, expose the causes of this unhealthy phenomenon, and provide them with specific education.

The letter then stated that as our consumption of grain increases year by year, the issue of increasing grain production remains a most important and urgent task. It would be best if, in 1957, we could reclaim another four to five million hectares of wasteland without increasing machinery, by improving the use of tractors and other agricultural machinery, for sowing grain. In addition, we should once again very seriously re-examine the distribution of sowing areas so that we can increase the grain sowing area in 1957 by using the land more rationally.

The main task of agriculture is to increase the yield per unit area of various crops. This task should be said to be a national, nationwide task.

The letter also discussed the issues of further expanding the sowing area of sugar beets, potatoes, and vegetables, increasing the production of milk and meat, developing poultry farming in collective farms and state farms, increasing the yield of corn, etc., and proposed the task of improving the work of machine tractor stations, rationally using tractors, and launching construction with local materials in rural areas.

When discussing the improvement of this year's agricultural planning work, the letter pointed out that in carrying out this work, it is very important that every agricultural production unit should comprehensively and deeply expose and criticize shortcomings, more fully explore existing potentials, consider and fully adopt all advanced experiences and advanced working methods, and carefully study all suggestions in order to formulate specific measures that can enable each agricultural production sector to develop more rapidly. In addition, in carrying out this work, we should attract the broad masses of agricultural workers and experts to participate, rather than relying solely on a few leaders.

The CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers believe that in the future, it is still necessary to strive to further consolidate collective farms organizationally and economically, comprehensively develop the public economy of collective farms, increase labor productivity of collective farms, and on this basis, improve the material welfare of collective farm members.

The letter concluded by saying that 1957 should be a year of more vigorous development of Soviet agriculture. The CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers firmly believe that Soviet men and women collective farm members, workers of machine tractor stations and state farms, agricultural experts, and all agricultural workers will victoriously implement the tasks of developing all agricultural sectors put forward by the 20th Congress of the CPSU.

    苏共中央和部长会议发表告农业劳动者书
    号召争取今年农业生产获得新成就
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科16日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议发表告农业劳动者、地方机构和全体农业工作者书，号召他们努力争取使农业生产在1957年获得进一步成就。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议指出，苏联劳动人民为苏共第二十次代表大会的决议所鼓舞，在党的领导下去年在发展工农业方面取得了巨大成就。去年苏联的农产品生产增加了。在这方面，有决定性意义的是开垦了三千五百五十万公顷荒地，使得苏联在去年能够大大地增加谷物的总收获量和储备量。在过去几年中，全国征购到二十到二十二亿普特的谷物已经被认为是很大的成就，然而在去年，农业劳动者交售给国家的谷物就有三十三亿多普特。此外，棉花、甜菜、蔬菜和马铃薯的产量和征购量也大大增加了，其中，单是原棉的征购量就比1955年多四十八万一千吨。由于在开垦荒地、增加谷物和棉花生产以及完成向国家交售这两种农产品的全年计划方面获得了出色的成绩，哈萨克、乌兹别克、塔吉克、土库曼和吉尔吉斯等共和国以及俄罗斯联邦的阿尔泰、克拉斯诺雅尔斯克、鄂木斯克等边疆区和州都荣获了列宁勋章。同时，开垦地区还有九万多农业劳动者得到了政府的奖赏。
    在发展畜牧业特别是牛奶生产方面也获得了显著的成就。去年，全苏联集体农庄的牛奶总产量已经几乎增加为1953年的两倍。从1945年到1953年，全国集体农庄每头奶牛的平均出奶量只增加了六十七公斤，而在1955—1956年一个经济年度里就增加了三百三十七公斤。牛奶的年度征购和收购计划大大提前完成了，交售给国家的牛奶比1955年多28％。去年，苏联的动物油产量比1955年增长了20％，与1953年相比则增长了45％。在发展肉类生产方面，去年集体农庄共喂养了约九百万口猪，即比1955年增加了一倍多。去年国家从各方面征购和收购的牲畜要比1955年多9％。
    最近几年来，苏联的国营农场的工作也改善了。它们上缴给国家的谷物、奶类、马铃薯、蔬菜和其他产品年年都有增加。去年它们上缴给国家九亿三千三百万普特谷物，约为1955年的三倍。
    号召书说，所有这些事实和数字说明了，我们伟大的高度机械化的社会主义农业的潜力和资源是多么雄厚。但是，远不是所有集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场、远不是所有地区在去年都充分利用了现有的来进一步增加农产品的产量。号召书接着详细列举了许多地区农业生产方面的缺点。
    号召书说，苏共中央和苏联部长会议认为，如果说1956年是胜利完成第六个五年计划规定的农产品增产任务的开端，那末在进一步发展各农业部门方面，1957年能够是而且应该是发生转折的一年。
    号召书说，必须使每个区、每个集体农庄和国营农场，在估计一切可能性和潜力的基础上订出提前完成第六个五年计划所规定的农产品生产任务的周全计划。必须进一步提高党、苏维埃和农业机关对农业的领导水平，提高集体农庄庄员对公有经济的积极性、加强劳动纪律、提高劳动生产率，这样才能解决提前完成第六个五年计划的任务。
    号召书批评了一些党组织和苏维埃的领导人近来对选择和加强集体农庄和国营农场的领导干部的工作不够重视的缺点，并且要求对那些不诚诚恳恳地对待工作和规避工作的人，集体农庄主席加以规训和严加惩处。为了进一步提高集体农庄庄员在集体经济中的积极性，加强劳动纪律，苏共中央和苏联部长会议还要求每个集体农庄仔细研究那些以种种借口来规避集体经济中的工作的集体农庄庄员对待集体生产的态度的问题，揭发这种不健康现象的原因，并且对他们进行具体的教育。
    号召书接着说，由于我们对粮食的消费量一年一年在增加，增加谷物生产的问题今后仍然是一项最重要的和迫切的任务。最好是在1957年能在不增加机器的情况下靠改进对拖拉机和其他农业机器的使用来多开垦四、五百万公顷的荒地，以播种谷物。此外，还应该再一次十分认真地重新研究播种面积的分配问题，以便靠更合理地使用田地的办法能在1957年增加谷物播种面积。
    农业的主要任务是提高各种农作物的单位面积产量。这一任务应该说是全民的、全国的任务。
    号召书还谈到了进一步扩大甜菜、马铃薯和蔬菜的播种面积、增加牛奶和肉类的产量、发展集体农庄和国营农场中的养禽业、提高玉蜀黍的产量等问题，并且，提出改进机器拖拉机站工作、合理使用拖拉机、在农村中展开用当地物资进行建设的任务。
    在谈到改进今年农业计划工作的时候，号召书指出，在进行这件工作时，非常重要的是，每一个农业生产单位都应该全面而深刻地揭发和批评缺点，更充分地发掘现有的潜力，考虑和充分采用一切先进经验和先进工作方法，详细研究一切建议，以便拟定出能使每一农业生产部门都能更迅速地发展的具体措施。此外，在进行这件工作时，还应该吸引广大的农业劳动者和专家参加，而不单单依靠几个领导人。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议认为，今后还必须争取进一步从组织上和经济上来巩固集体农庄、全面发展集体农庄的公有经济，提高集体农庄的劳动生产率，并且在这个基础上提高集体农庄庄员的物质福利。
    号召书最后说，1957年应当成为苏联农业更加蓬勃发展的一年。苏共中央和苏联部长会议坚决相信，苏联男女集体农庄庄员、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工人、农业专家和全体农业工作者将胜利地执行苏共第二十次代表大会提出的关于发展所有农业部门的任务。
