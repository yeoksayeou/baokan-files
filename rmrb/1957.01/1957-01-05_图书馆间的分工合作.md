Since the Party and the government called for an advance towards science, society's utilization of books and materials and demands for library services have gradually increased; library staff have also become tense, demanding to strengthen their work and improve the quality of service to scientific work. The Ministry of Culture, which is in charge of provincial and municipal local libraries, and the Ministry of Higher Education, which is in charge of higher education institution libraries, have also separately convened meetings of their affiliated libraries to determine the direction and tasks of the libraries and to issue instructions on strengthening library services. The Chinese library community is showing an unprecedentedly active atmosphere.

Libraries are a huge force in academic and cultural undertakings. All academic and cultural undertakings cannot be separated from the services of libraries. However, at present, this force of libraries in our country is still very weak. Whether viewed from the number of libraries nationwide, the ratio of libraries to the population, the quantity of books in the country, the quality of the books, especially foreign language books and classics on modern science and technology, or the quality of library services nationwide, our libraries are far behind the requirements of today's rapidly progressing society. It is necessary to make China's libraries break away from the various backward states of today in order to exert their due enormous power.

One of the ways to break away from the backward state of libraries today is to strengthen the service capabilities of libraries on the existing basis, which is to solve the problem of division of labor and cooperation among libraries.

At present, Chinese libraries can be roughly divided into three systems: the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Higher Education, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This is only a classification of libraries in terms of administrative management or affiliation. Because a library is a business organization, and an academic business organization, the difference between libraries mainly lies in the service objects. Therefore, the division of labor and cooperation mentioned here is only considered from the business aspect of the library.

In the current backward state of Chinese libraries, no library can be allowed to work alone. In fact, no library can remain in a completely independent stage. Everyone must cooperate with each other through division of labor. In this process of division of labor and cooperation, large libraries with a long history and a strong foundation should shoulder more responsibilities. However, until now, except for some temporary and informal contacts between individual libraries, the vast Chinese library community is still doing its own thing in terms of work and business, without any contact with each other, and without good division of labor and cooperation. Some libraries, although they have the strength, are indifferent or even refuse to cooperate. To strengthen China's library resources and service capabilities today, it is necessary to thoroughly implement planned cooperation and division of labor.

Due to the limitations of manpower, financial resources, basic construction, and other conditions, except for the Beijing Library, no library can carry out a large amount of procurement. It must restrict its procurement according to the daily needs of its service objects. The principle of book procurement should be practical and realistic, and avoid greed for more, being fond of greatness, and being eager for success. Because the procurement of each library cannot but be subject to certain restrictions, the procurement of each library must be limited to the needs of the service objects, so it naturally tends to division of labor, and the division of labor of libraries in some aspects forms the specialization of libraries. The development of specialized libraries is worthy of warm welcome. To meet the needs of the march towards science and to welcome the arrival of China's cultural upsurge, the importance of specialized libraries will become increasingly significant.

The specialization of libraries means that the collection is specialized but not complete. To make up for this incomplete collection, libraries must exchange what they have with each other. One way to communicate what you have is to establish interlibrary loan relationships, which is a kind of cooperation. In many countries, interlibrary loan has developed into an important system in the library community, and interlibrary loan regulations like laws have been formulated, which are jointly observed by all libraries participating in interlibrary loan. Today, China's library community should emulate them and develop interlibrary loan on a large scale, making it an important system in library operations. To establish this system, all libraries must first jointly formulate enforceable interlibrary loan regulations. It should be pointed out that the main purpose of interlibrary loan is to provide the necessary reference for academic research and teaching, not to serve the needs of general reading. Therefore, the libraries that can establish or join interlibrary loan relationships should be limited.

Interlibrary loan can give full play to the role of books. It strengthens the power of book supply on the existing basis, making each library stronger, thereby strengthening the service power of libraries nationwide.

Interlibrary loan also has its limitations. One limitation is the distance between libraries that have established interlibrary loan relationships. In a small country, interlibrary loan can proceed smoothly without being limited by distance. However, in our country with a vast area, interlibrary loan cannot but encounter the difficulties of long-distance postal delivery or transportation. Therefore, in a country like ours, except for very special needs, interlibrary loan can only be regional, not national. That is to say, interlibrary loan is generally carried out between libraries within a region.

Regional interlibrary loan must be based on the regulations of the geographical area of the library. In a country with a vast area, in order to develop the national book resources and strength, a national library regional plan should be made, just as the development of national economic construction must make plans for economic regions, agricultural regions, industrial regions, and so on. The library geographical regional plan should be formulated according to the service nature of each library, book resources, and geographical distance between libraries, rather than according to the library's administrative system or affiliation. A reasonable library regional plan should enable all libraries in the region to further strengthen services and play a role.

Another way for libraries to communicate what they have is interlibrary exchange. Interlibrary loan is to satisfy what the other party does not have with what one party has without changing the ownership of the book. Interlibrary exchange is the mutual exchange of what each party has for what the other party does not have. It is a system that is prevalent all over the world today, and it is not limited to domestic libraries, but expands to the international scope. Until now, the Chinese library community has not yet developed the book exchange system. One reason for not developing may be that many libraries with more collections have not yet cleared out the books and cannot decide which books can be exchanged and which books cannot be exchanged. This is understandable. However, in individual cases, there is also such a regrettable phenomenon that fundamentally negates exchange and adopts a completely resistant attitude to exchange. The main function of book exchange is to realize the use value of books and make books fully used. Therefore, all personnel in charge of books have the responsibility to make all books get their place and make full use of them, instead of letting them sleep in the library or on the bookshelf. In the current situation of scarcity of book resources in China, it is not right not to give full play to the greatest role of all books.

Since liberation, due to various facilities, movements, system changes, and other reasons, the management of books has undergone tremendous changes. For example, due to the adjustment of departments and departments of higher education institutions, some institutions have a large number of books that are completely useless to their departments, and some institutions have obtained a large number of duplicate copies of books. These duplicate copies or books that are useless to oneself should be adjusted under the interlibrary exchange system. To enrich our book resources, we should quickly promote the interlibrary exchange system.

To provide convenience for interlibrary loan, a union catalog of libraries nationwide or regionally should be compiled for reference. China's existing collection of books is vast, with hundreds of thousands of types and tens of millions of volumes. The compilation of a union catalog is not an easy task. It must be fully prepared and mobilize the strength of all libraries to cooperate in carrying it out.

Compiling a union catalog of books will obviously have to wait for some time. But what should and can be done at present is publications such as new book catalogs. New book catalogs are of great use both for library operations and for the needs of readers. Libraries in all countries generally publish new book catalogs. For example, the German Democratic Republic has two types of new book catalogs that are published regularly. One is called "German National Bibliography", which specializes in the bibliography of works published in Germany and German works published abroad, divided into two volumes, A and B. Volume A publishes the catalogs of publications appearing on the book market; Volume B publishes the catalogs of new publications appearing outside the book market. The book catalog is divided into two versions, one is a general version for daily use, and the other is a library version, in which the library cuts out each publication in the catalog and pastes it on a card, which becomes a book card, which can save cataloging work. It is not difficult to imagine that this library version of the German National Bibliography must have saved a considerable amount of manpower, financial resources, and time spent on cataloging for libraries across the country. Another bibliography in the German Democratic Republic is "New Scientific Books", which publishes the names of new scientific books acquired by scientific libraries across the country, divided into two volumes, A and B. Volume A is natural science and technology; Volume B is social science. Both catalogs are compiled by the national library, that is, the "German National Bibliography" is compiled and printed by the German Library, and the "New Scientific Books" is compiled and printed by the German National Library.

The two types of catalogs mentioned above are exactly what our library community needs. We should compile our own, that is, the Chinese New Book Catalog, published on a periodical basis.

The Chinese New Book Catalog should be edited and printed by the Beijing Library. It is appropriate for a rich and powerful national library to compile and print a new book catalog.

Regarding the editing of the scientific new book catalog, there is currently no most appropriate institution. The procurement and acquisition of scientific books in our country are scattered in many research units (such as the research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and various enterprise departments) and libraries of various higher education institutions. So far, there is no huge scientific book collection center. Therefore, we have to seek a temporary solution. Since the Chinese Academy of Sciences Library purchases slightly more scientific books than any other library, it can temporarily be responsible for editing and printing under the assistance and support of scientific research units (including the research institutes of the Academy of Sciences) and libraries of higher education institutions across the country.

It can be affirmed that libraries and countless readers across the country will welcome the publication of these two new book catalogs.

Cooperation between libraries is diverse. In addition to the three specific tasks of interlibrary loan, interlibrary exchange, and new book catalogs pointed out here, many other cooperative activities can be added as the cooperative activities of libraries develop, such as editing various union catalogs, catalog indexes, reproduction work, reprint work, and so on.

    图书馆间的分工合作
    中国科学院副院长　陶孟和
    自从党和政府号召向科学进军以来，社会上对图书资料的利用和对图书馆服务的要求已经逐渐加多；图书馆的工作人员也紧张起来，要求加强自己的工作，增进为科学工作服务的质量。主管省市地方图书馆的文化部和主管高等院校图书馆的高等教育部，也分别召开了所属图书馆的会议，确定图书馆的方针任务，做出关于加强图书馆服务的指示。中国图书馆界呈现出空前活跃的气象。
    图书馆是学术文化事业里的一份巨大力量。一切学术文化事业都不能离开图书馆的服务。但是，目前我国图书馆的这份力量还十分薄弱。无论从哪一方面来看，从全国图书馆的数量，从全国图书馆和人口数量的比例，从全国藏书的数量，从全国藏书的质量，尤其是关于现代科学技术的外文图书典籍，或是从全国图书馆服务的质量来看，我们的图书馆还远远落在今天飞跃进步的社会的要求后面。必须使中国的图书馆摆脱今天的种种落后状态，才可以发挥它所应有的巨大力量。
    摆脱今天图书馆落后状态的途径之一，就是在现有的基础上加强图书馆的服务能力，就是要解决图书馆之间的分工合作的问题。
      目前中国图书馆大体上可以分为文化部、高等教育部和中国科学院的三个体系。这只是在行政管理上或隶属关系上对图书馆的分类。因为图书馆是一种业务机构，并且是学术性的业务机构，图书馆和图书馆之间的差别主要在服务对象方面，因此这里所说分工合作只是从图书馆业务方面着眼的。
    在今天中国图书馆的落后状态下，不能允许任何图书馆做单干户，事实上也没有一个图书馆能够停留在完全单干户的阶段，必须大家分工合作起来。而在这个分工合作过程中，大型图书馆，具有悠久历史和强大基础的图书馆尤其应该较多地担负一些责任。然而一直到现在，除了在个别的图书馆之间有了一些临时的非正式的联系外，中国广大的图书馆界在工作上、在业务上，还是各干各的，彼此之间没有联系，没有很好地分工合作。有的图书馆虽然自己有力量，但对合作表示冷淡甚至表示拒绝。为加强今天中国图书馆的资源和服务力量，就必须彻底地实行有计划的合作与分工。
    由于人力财力基本建设等种种条件的限制，除了北京图书馆以外，没有一个图书馆能够进行大量的采购的，它必须按照服务对象的日常需要，约束自己的采购。图书采购的原则应该是实事求是，切忌贪多务得，好大喜功。因为每个图书馆的采购不能不受到一定的限制，各图书馆的采购便须以服务对象所经常需用的为限，于是自然而然地趋于分工，而图书馆的分工在有些方面便形成图书馆的专业化。专业图书馆的发展是值得热烈欢迎的。为满足向科学进军的需要，为迎接我国文化高潮的到来，专业图书馆的重要性将日益显著。
    图书馆的专业化意味着收藏专精而不齐全。为补足这个收藏不齐全的现象，图书馆便必须在彼此之间互通有无。有无相通的一个方式便是建立馆际互借关系，这就是一种合作。在许多国家里，馆际互借已经发展成为图书馆界的重要制度，制定法律般的馆际互借条例，为一切参加馆际互借的图书馆所共同遵守。今天我国的图书馆界应该仿效它们，大规模地发展馆际互借，使它在图书馆业务上成为一项重要制度。为确立这项制度，首先必须由各图书馆共同商订可供执行的馆际互借条例。应该指出，馆际互借的主要目的是为学术研究与教学上参考的必需，而不是为普通阅读的需要服务。所以能够建立或加入馆际互借关系的图书馆应该是有限制的。
    馆际互借能充分发挥图书的作用，它在现有的基础上加强图书供应的力量，使每个图书馆都强大起来，从而壮大了全国图书馆服务的力量。
    馆际互借也有它的限制，一个限制就是建立互借关系的图书馆之间的距离问题。在一个小的国家里，馆际互借可以不受距离的限制，顺利进行。然而在我们这个地区辽阔的国家里，馆际互借便不能不遇到长距离的邮递或运输的困难。因此，在我们这样的国家里，除了极特殊的需要以外，馆际互借只能是区域性的，不可能是全国性的。这就是说，馆际互借一般地在一个区域以内的图书馆之间进行。
    区域的馆际互借必须根据图书馆地理区域的规定。在一个地区辽阔的国家里，为发展全国的图书资源和力量，应该做出全国图书馆区域规划，正如同发展国民经济建设必须对经济区域、农业区域、工业区域等等做出规划一样。图书馆地理区域规划应该按各图书馆的服务性质、图书资源、图书馆之间的地理距离等来考虑制定，而不是按图书馆行政系统或隶属关系制定的。一个合理的图书馆区域规划应该使所有在本区域内的图书馆都可以进一步加强服务，发挥作用。
    图书馆之间有无相通的另一种方式是馆际交换。馆际互借是在对图书所有权不变更的情况下，以一方之所有满足另一方之所无。馆际交换是两方相互地以其所有，易其所无。它是今天在全世界上盛行的一种制度，它不单限于国内图书馆之间，而且扩大范围到国际之间。一直到现在，中国图书馆之间还没有发展图书交换这个制度。没有发展的一个原因可能是因为许多收藏较多的图书馆至今还没有将图书清理出来，不能决定何书可以交换，何书不能交换。这是可以理解的。但是在个别的情况下，也有这样可惋惜的现象，就是根本否定交换，对交换采取完全抗拒态度。图书交换的主要功用就是实现图书的使用价值，使图书获得充分使用。因此，一切主管图书的人员都有责任使一切图书得其所，尽其用，而不是使它在书库里或书架上长眠。在今天中国图书资源贫乏的情况下，不使所有的图书发挥它最大的作用是不应该的。
    解放以来，由于各种设施、运动、制度变更等原因，图书的管理已经有了巨大的变动。如由于高等学校的院系调整，有的院校便拥有大量与自己的科系完全无用的图书，有的院校则获得大量的图书的复本。对于这些复本书或与己无用的图书，应该在馆际交换的制度下进行调整。为丰富我们图书的资源，应该赶快推行馆际交换制度。
    为提供馆际互借的便利，应该编出全国的或区域的各图书馆的联合目录供参考之用。中国现有藏书浩如烟海，种类以十万计，册数以千万计。联合目录的编制不是轻而易举的，必须有充分的准备，并且动员一切图书馆的力量，通力合作进行。
    编制图书联合目录显然还要等些时候。但目前应该并且可以进行的还有新书目录一类的刊物。无论为图书馆的业务或为读者的需要，新书目录都有大用。世界各国的图书馆一般都有新书目录刊行。例如民主德国就有两种新书目录，经常出版。一种名为“德意志国家图书目录”，专载在德国出版的著作和在国外出版的德文著作的书目，分甲乙二集。甲集刊载图书市场上出现的刊物目录；乙集刊载在图书市场以外新出现的刊物目录。图书目录分为两种版本，一种为普通版本，供日常使用，另一种为图书馆版，由图书馆将目录中的每种刊物裁剪下来，贴在卡片上即成为书卡，可以节省编目工作。不难想像，这个图书馆版的德意志国家图书目录一定为全国各图书馆节省了费在编目上的相当大量的人力、财力和时间。民主德国的另一种书目是“新科学图书”，刊载全国各科学图书馆新入藏的科学图书名称，分甲乙二集。甲集系自然科学、技术；乙集系社会科学。两种目录均由国家图书馆负责编订，即“德意志国家图书目录”由德意志图书馆编印，“新科学图书”由德国国家图书馆编印。
    像以上所说的两种目录正是我国图书馆界所需要的。我们应该编制自己的，就是中国新书目录，按期刊行。
    中国新书目录应该由北京图书馆负责编辑印行。由一个典藏富裕、力量雄厚的国家图书馆编印新书目录是适当的。
    关于科学新书目录的编辑，目前还没有最适当的机关。我国科学图书的采购和入藏，分散在许许多多研究单位里（如中国科学院和各企业部门的研究所）和各高等院校图书馆里，至今还没有一个巨大的收藏科学图书中心。因此只得谋一权宜办法。由于中国科学院图书馆采购科学图书比较其它任何图书馆略为多些，暂时可以由中国科学院图书馆在全国各科学研究单位（包括科学院各研究所在内）及高等院校图书馆协助支持之下，负责编辑印行。
    可以肯定，全国的图书馆和无数的读者都要欢迎这两种新书目录的出版。
    图书馆间的合作是多式多样的，除了这里所指出的馆际互借、馆际交换和新书目录三项具体工作以外，随着图书馆合作活动的发展，还可以增加许多其它的合作活动，如编辑各种各样的联合目录、目录索引、复制工作、翻印工作等等。
