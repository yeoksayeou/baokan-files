    Xin County Prefecture, Shanxi Province
    Introducing Soviet Fine Wool Sheep Breeds for Large-Scale Breeding

    (By Our Newspaper) Xin County Prefecture in Shanxi Province has successfully experimented with the introduction of Soviet Caucasian and Merino sheep breeds for breeding fine wool sheep over the past five years. Currently, the area has bred over 39,500 new fine wool sheep. The new breed of fine wool sheep are hybrid offspring born from artificially inseminating local ewes with the semen of the imported breeds. Their main advantages are high wool yield and good wool quality. Fine wool is mainly used for weaving high-grade woolen fabrics and fine serge. According to statistics, each first-generation improved sheep produces an average of 3.875 to 4.0625 pounds of wool per year, with the highest-yielding sheep producing 7 pounds annually. The third-generation improved sheep can produce 10 pounds of wool per year. The third-generation new fine wool sheep produces 8.5 pounds more wool per year than local sheep. Because of the excellent quality of the new fine wool sheep, each pound of wool is worth 50% more than local wool (local wool is priced at 80 cents to 1 yuan per pound, while the new breed's wool is priced at 1.2 to 1.5 yuan per pound). Wu Chenglai, a farmer in Wanglangou Village, Kelan County, earned 763 yuan in 1955 solely from raising fine wool sheep.

    The new fine wool sheep are cold-resistant, disease-resistant, and well-suited for raising in Xin County Prefecture. These sheep also have the advantage of being able to eat coarse feed, and their survival rate is high. According to statistics, from 1952 to the end of 1955, a total of 24,545 lambs were born, with 22,826 surviving, a survival rate of 93%.

    The new fine wool sheep are widely welcomed by farmers. It is estimated that by the end of May 1957, the number of new fine wool sheep in the area will have increased to over 60,000.

    山西省忻县专区
    引用苏联良种羊大量繁殖细毛羊
    本报讯　山西省忻县专区五年来试验引用苏联高加索种羊和美利奴种羊繁殖细毛羊成功。目前这个区已繁殖新种细毛羊达三万九千五百余只。新种细毛羊是用人工授精方法给当地母羊输精而生的杂交后代。它们的主要优点是产毛多，毛质好。细毛羊毛主要用途是纺织高等呢料和细毛哔叽。据统计，每只第一代改良羊一年平均产毛三斤十四两至四斤一两，最高的一只羊年产毛七斤。而第三代改良羊每只每年可产毛十斤。第三代新种细毛羊比本地羊每只每年可多产毛八斤半。由于新种细毛羊毛质优良，所以每斤毛比本地羊毛价高50％（本地羊毛每斤八角至一元，新种羊毛每斤一元二至一元五角）。岢岚县王兰沟村农民武成来1955年靠喂细毛羊就收入七百六十三元。
    新种细毛羊耐寒，抗病力强，正适于忻县专区饲养。这种羊还有能吃粗饲料的优点，成活率也高。据统计，从1952年至1955年底，共生羔两万四千五百四十五只，成活的就达到两万二千八百二十六只。成活率达93％。
    新种细毛羊受到农民的普遍欢迎，预计到1957年5月底，这个区新种细毛羊可繁殖到六万多只。
