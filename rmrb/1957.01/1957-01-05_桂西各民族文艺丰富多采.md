Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 2nd: More than fifty rich and colorful dance, music, and drama programs newly unearthed from the Zhuang, Yao, Miao, Dong, and other eight ethnic minorities in Guangxi Province added new content to the eleven-day "Second Ethnic Folk Art Performance Conference of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture".
	Among the performances appearing for the first time at the conference were the Zhuang "Yanchiu Dance," which has been passed down for four hundred years, the Miao "Kaluo Dance," which has not been performed for more than sixty years, as well as the Yi people's "Five Reed Pipe Dance" and the Yao people's "Bronze Drum Dance." These dances all preserve a strong ethnic style and characteristics. Mountain songs and folk songs from various ethnic minorities in the province were performed at the meeting. Among them were Yao ethnic mountain song choruses, and "Wuzhuan Mountain Songs" reflecting the Zhuang people's participation in the land revolutionary struggle. There were also "The Eighth Horn is Ripe" and "Gan Ba Ai," which rhythmically converted mountain songs into Zhuang ethnic song and dance. The new drama type "Hamae," adapted from the long-circulated myths of the Miao people in the Great Miao Mountains, and the performance of the Zhuang opera "Lazi Shu," also won praise from the audience.
	The conference ended on December 30, 1956.

    桂西各民族文艺丰富多采
    据新华社南宁2日电　广西省僮、瑶、苗、侗等八个少数民族新发掘的五十多个丰富多采的舞蹈、音乐和戏剧节目，给历时十一天的“桂西僮族自治州第二次民族民间文艺观摩会演大会”增添了新的内容。
    第一次出现在会演大会上的，有流传四百年的僮族“燕球舞”，有六十多年不舞了的苗族“卡洛舞”，以及倮倮人的“五笙舞”和瑶族的“铜鼓舞”等。这些舞蹈，都保存着浓厚的民族风格和特点。会上表演了省内各少数民族的山歌和民歌。其中有瑶族山歌合唱，有反映僮族人民参加土地革命斗争的“五篆山歌”。还有把山歌节奏化，编成僮族歌舞的“八角成熟了”和“甘八埃”等。根据大苗山苗族人民流传已久的神话，改编成的新剧种“哈埋”，和僮戏“腊纸书”的演出，也博得观众的好评。
    会演大会于1956年12月30日结束。
