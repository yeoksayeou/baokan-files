Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, January 15th: Marko, Chairman of the Albanian People's Assembly, hosted a banquet on the evening of January 14th to welcome the delegation of the Chinese National People's Congress headed by Peng Zhen, and the delegation of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee.

Present at the banquet were Lleshi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Albanian People's Assembly, Shehu, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and others.

Xu Yixin, Chinese Ambassador to Albania, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Albania were also invited to the banquet.

Marko delivered a welcoming speech, warmly welcoming the delegation's visit. He said: We thank you for this visit, which will be a contribution to strengthening the eternal friendship between Albania and China. The Albanian people and their representative body, the People's Assembly, will always be faithful to the unbreakable fraternal friendship and unity of the socialist camp.

Peng Zhen delivered a speech in response amidst warm applause. He said: After these few days of visits and tours, we have personally seen that the liberated Albanian people, under the leadership of the Labor Party and the government, and with the assistance of the Soviet Union, have built Albania into a new country where the working people are the masters. Peng Zhen then spoke of the enormous achievements Albania has made in industry, agriculture and all other fields since liberation. He said that in contact with Albanian comrades, we often hear you say that your country is a small country and that China has given you a lot of assistance. Comrades, no matter the size of a country, as long as it has the leadership of the Communist Party, its own people's regime, and the unity of the entire people, follows the direction of Marxism-Leninism, and advances along the path of peace, democracy, and socialism, it is glorious and worthy of respect. As for China's assistance to you, it is true that there is some. However, the assistance is very small. What is important is that your heroic Albanian people, relying on the unity and heroic struggle of your entire people, and relying on the support of the socialist countries led by the Soviet Union, have made great contributions and achievements in defending world peace, democracy, and socialism in extremely difficult conditions. This is worthy of congratulations and admiration. All our socialist countries, regardless of their size or population, need to support each other and be friendly and united.

Shehu then raised a glass to wish the friendship between socialist countries to continue to strengthen and consolidate.

The banquet was filled with an atmosphere of cordial fraternal friendship.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, January 15th: The delegation of the Chinese National People's Congress is currently visiting various parts of Albania in batches.

A group of delegates led by Peng Zhen, head of the delegation, accompanied by Marko, Chairman of the Albanian People's Assembly, and others, have already visited Shkodër in northern Albania for two days. They visited many factories and cultural and artistic institutions there, and also attended a mass welcome rally.

Another group of delegates, led by Zhang Bojun, deputy head of the delegation, visited Vlorë in southern Albania and Stalin City, one of Albania's largest oil-producing areas. Piristeri, Vice-Chairman of the Presidium of the Albanian People's Assembly, and others accompanied the delegates on their visits.

    马尔科首先致欢迎词，热烈欢迎代表团的访问。他说：我们感谢你们这一次的访问，它对加强阿、中永恒的友谊将是一个贡献。阿尔巴尼亚人民和他们的代表机关——人民议会将永远忠实于社会主义阵营牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊和团结。
    彭真在热烈的掌声中致答词。他说：经过这几天的访问参观，我们亲眼看到解放了的阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党和政府的领导下，在苏联的援助下，已经把阿尔巴尼亚建设成为一个劳动人民当家做主的新的国家。彭真接着谈到了阿尔巴尼亚解放以来的工、农业和各方面的巨大成就。他说，在同阿尔巴尼亚同志们接触中，常常听到你们说，你们的国家是一个小国，说中国给了你们许多援助。同志们，国不论大小，只要有共产党的领导，有人民自己的政权，有全国人民的团结一致，遵循着马克思列宁主义的方向，沿着和平、民主、社会主义的道路前进，就是光荣的，就是值得尊敬的。至于说中国对你们的援助，不错，是有一些。但是，援助是很小的。重要的，是你们英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民依靠着你们全国人民的团结和英勇斗争，依靠着以苏联为首的社会主义各国的支持，在极端困难的条件下，捍卫世界和平、民主、社会主义事业中所作出的巨大贡献和成就。这是值得祝贺和钦佩的。我们所有的社会主义国家，不论国家大小、人口多少，都是需要互相支持和友好团结的。
