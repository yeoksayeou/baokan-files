The CCP Anhui Provincial Committee has put forward a preliminary plan for adjusting institutions and streamlining staff throughout the province. Following the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the CCP Anhui Provincial Committee called on the province to launch an increase production and practice economy campaign and immediately began studying the work of increasing production and practicing economy in 1957. At a recent enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee, the CCP Anhui Provincial Committee and the responsible persons of the prefectural (municipal) and county committees jointly conducted research. In addition to making preliminary plans for increasing production and practicing economy in industry and agriculture, the meeting, based on the principle of streamlining the upper levels and strengthening the lower levels to overcome bureaucracy, improve work efficiency, and strengthen production leadership, studied and proposed a preliminary plan for adjusting institutions and streamlining staff. According to this plan, the existing institutions at all levels will be adjusted and merged. It is planned that provincial-level organs will be streamlined by an average of 30%, prefectural-level committees will be streamlined by 40% to 50%, provincial-level cities will generally be streamlined by about 10%, and counties will generally be streamlined by 20% to 30% depending on the situation (some counties with large institutions, such as Xuancheng County, should also increase the streamlining), and district-level institutions will be gradually abolished. The number of personnel at the township level will also be streamlined by an average of 28% according to the prescribed establishment. The meeting held that 20% to 30% of the personnel should be immediately transferred from the provincial, special, and county levels to the lower levels to strengthen the leadership of production and various tasks. The enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee believed that this streamlining of staff, in order to overcome bureaucracy, strengthen lower-level leadership, improve work efficiency, and develop production, must properly arrange the surplus personnel so that they can be properly placed and give full play to their strengths.
After the meeting, all localities are further studying and drafting specific plans based on the preliminary plan for streamlining staff proposed by the Provincial Party Committee, and submitting them to the Provincial Streamlining Committee for review and approval.

    安徽省委提出全省精简方案
    要求省、专区和县立即抽调20％至30％的人员到基层去
    本报讯　中共安徽省委员会已经提出在全省范围内调整机构、精简编制的初步方案。中共安徽省委在党的二中全会以后，即号召全省开展增产节约运动，并即着手研究1957年增产节约工作。在最近省委召开的扩大会议上，中共安徽省委和地（市）委、县委负责人，又共同进行了研究。会议除作出工农业等增产节约的初步方案外，并根据精简上层，充实下层，以克服官僚主义、提高工作效率、加强生产领导的方针，研究并提出了调整机构精简编制的初步方案。根据这一方案，对各级现有机构将实行调整和裁并。预定省级机关平均精简人员30％，地委级精简40％到50％，省辖市一般精简10％左右，各县根据不同情况，一般也精简20％到30％（机构庞大的某些县如宣城县等还应加大精简幅度），并逐步撤消区级机构，乡级人员根据规定编制，也平均精简28％。会议认为，应立即在省、专、县级各调出20％到30％的人员到下层去，加强生产和各项工作的领导。省委扩大会议认为，这次精简编制，既是为了克服官僚主义，充实下层领导，提高工作效率，发展生产，就必须妥善安排编余的人员，使其能够各得其所，充分发挥他们的力量。
    会后，各地正在根据省委提出的精简编制的初步方案，进一步研究并拟订具体方案，报请省整编委员会审查批准执行。
