    Like One Family
    In March 1956, Zhang Dashun came from his hometown in Shandong Province to Fangzheng County, Heilongjiang Province, with his six-year-old son, Xiao Fuzhu, and joined the local Red Star Agricultural Cooperative. In the cooperative, Lao Zhang worked very hard and never took a break. On August 4th, Zhang Dashun suddenly fell ill. The cooperative director, Liu Gui, immediately sent cooperative member Zhou Zhenjiang to fetch a doctor. After diagnosis, it was said to be acute gastroenteritis. That evening, the cooperative hurriedly sent someone to take Zhang Dashun to the county hospital by cart.

    The next day, when the cooperative management committee was discussing how to solve Lao Zhang's medical expenses, they raised the question of what to do with Xiao Fuzhu being alone at home. Director Liu Gui thought for a moment and said:
    "Xiao Fuzhu gets along very well with our Xiao Kaifu, so let him stay at my house for a few days."

    After Xiao Fuzhu arrived at Director Liu's house, he played very well with Xiao Kaifu during the day, but he cried very loudly at night. Director Liu was very worried. He thought: Is it because Xiao Fuzhu was used to sleeping with his dad, hugging him, and now he's crying because no one is taking care of him while he sleeps? So he hugged Xiao Fuzhu to sleep, and this time Xiao Fuzhu calmed down. In September, as the weather gradually turned cold, Director Liu went to the supply and marketing cooperative to buy cloth and cotton, and had his wife make a cotton-padded coat for Xiao Fuzhu.

    On the Mid-Autumn Festival, Director Liu carried a small basket of cooked eggs and led Xiao Fuzhu to the hospital. When Lao Zhang saw Director Liu leading Xiao Fuzhu and also wearing a new cotton-padded coat, tears rolled down his cheeks. After a long time, he said the first sentence to Director Liu: "Director Liu, you are truly my family." ·Long Jiang·

    亲如一家
    1956年3月间，张大顺领着一个六岁的儿子小福柱，由山东老家来到了黑龙江省的方正县，并参加了当地的红星农业社。在社里，老张干起活来特别下力气，从来没有歇过工。8月4日这一天，张大顺突然得了病。社主任刘贵马上派社员周振江去请大夫。经过诊断，说是急性肠胃炎，当天晚间，社里急忙派人赶车把张大顺送到了县医院。
    第二天，社管委会在研究解决老张的医药费时，提出小福柱一人在家怎么办？主任刘贵想了想说：
  “小福柱跟我们小开福很对劲，就让他先上我家去住几天吧。”
    小福柱到刘主任家后，白天跟小开福玩得很好，但晚间却哭得很厉害。刘主任很着急，他想：是不是小福柱跟他爸睡觉时搂惯了，现在睡觉没人管哭呢？于是他就搂着小福柱睡，这回小福柱才安静下来。到了9月，天气渐冷，刘主任就到供销社去买来了布和棉花，让老伴给小福柱作了一套棉衣。
    中秋节这天，刘主任提着一小筐熟鸡蛋，领着小福柱到医院去。当老张看到刘主任领着小福柱还穿上了新棉衣时，泪珠从眼眶里滚了出来，隔了好长时间，才向刘主任说出了第一句话：“刘主任，你真是我的亲人。”　·龙江·
