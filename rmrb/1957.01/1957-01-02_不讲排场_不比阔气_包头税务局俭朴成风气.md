    Not Emphasizing Extravagance, Not Competing in Ostentation:
    Baotou Tax Bureau Cultivates a Thrifty Style
    (Our report) According to the Baotou Daily, frugality and simplicity have become the norm in the Baotou Municipal Tax Bureau. From January to November 1956, the bureau saved the state over 3,350 yuan in administrative and operational expenses.
    The office equipment in the Baotou Municipal Tax Bureau is very simple. Over the years, the bureau has not added any new desks, chairs, or cabinets. The equipment they are currently using has been repaired and nailed repeatedly. Many employees work sitting on small stools without backs, and the desks they use are no more than two and a half feet long. Comrade Liu Chengde, who is responsible for general affairs, properly manages the bureau's property, making the most of every item.
    Many of the bureau's staff members are able to find ways to save money for the state. Over the years, Comrade Zhao Changzai, who operates the boiler, has managed to burn more than four tons of coal dust that the bureau had accumulated. He also makes his own brooms and fills cracks in the walls himself. Comrade Tang Renfu in the mailroom is an expert at reusing old envelopes, trying to reuse all incoming envelopes. In May 1956, the bureau staff sorted out old and discarded forms and paper from previous years and used them as office paper. They have not bought office paper for half a year. In order not to tie up state funds, the bureau handed over some materials they did not need to the state.
    The bureau has three directors, and their offices and dormitories are very simple. Deputy Director Ji Zhe's family of five lives in only one room. According to regulations, directors can travel by car for work, but Deputy Director Hu Boqi often takes public transportation when going to the new district. Zhao Zide, the office secretary, said, "Our directors neither emphasize extravagance nor are they special." Although the working conditions in the bureau are relatively difficult, the staff's morale is high.
    Why has the Baotou Municipal Tax Bureau maintained the tradition of diligence, thrift, and hard work for several years? Comrade Ji Zhe, the deputy director of the bureau, said: "The 'Three-Anti' and 'Five-Anti' movements were a profound education for our bureau's staff. Over the years, we have regularly educated our cadres on protecting public property, opposing extravagance and waste, and promoting a style of hard work and simplicity. Most comrades have the idea that we shouldn't emphasize extravagance or compete in ostentation, and we shouldn't spend money if it can be avoided."

    不讲排场　不比阔气
    包头税务局俭朴成风气
    本报讯　据包头日报报道：包头市税务局勤俭朴素已经成为风气。1956年1月到11月，该局共给国家节约了行政费和业务费三千三百五十多元。
    包头市税务局的办公设备很简朴。几年来，该局没有添设新的桌椅柜橱，现在用的这些设备，都是修了又修、钉了又钉。有许多工作人员坐着没有靠背的小板凳办公，用的桌子长不过二尺半。作总务工作的刘承德同志，对局内财产进行了妥善的保管，做到了物尽其用。
    该局的很多工作人员，都能够想办法为国家节约开支。几年来，该局积攒下的四吨多煤末子，烧锅炉的赵长在同志都想办法烧了，他还自己扎扫帚，自己抹房缝子。收发室的唐仁甫同志，是个利用旧信封的能手，所有外来的信封他都要想法再用一遍。1956年5月间，该局工作人员把几年来的废旧表格和废纸，整理出来作为办公用纸。他们已有半年没有买办公纸了。为了不积压国家资金，该局把一些自己不用的物资缴给了国家。
    该局有三个局长，他们的办公室和宿舍都很简朴。副局长纪哲同志一家五口人只住一间房子；按规定，局长外出工作可以坐小汽车，但副局长胡波起同志去新区，经常是坐共公汽车。办公室秘书赵子德同志说：我们的局长们，既不讲排场，又不特殊。该局的工作条件虽然比较艰苦，但是工作人员情绪很高。
    包头市税务局为什么几年来一直保持了勤俭节约、艰苦朴素的传统呢？该局副局长纪哲同志说：“三反”、“五反”运动对我局工作人员是一次深刻的教育。几年来，我们经常对干部进行爱护共公财产、反对铺张浪费、发扬艰苦朴素作风的教育。多数同志都有这样一种思想：不讲排场，不比阔气，可花可不花的钱就不花。
