    Lesseps Statue Falls
    On December 24th, the day after the Egyptian hero city of Port Said was liberated, with a thunderous crash, people blew up the statue of Frenchman Ferdinand de Lesseps, which had stood at the northern entrance of the Suez Canal since 1899.
    Lesseps was the founder of the former Suez Canal Company and a sentinel of the French colonialists. He was a notorious nouveau riche and one of the biggest speculators on the Paris Stock Exchange. In 1854, with the behind-the-scenes cooperation of Napoleon III, he obtained a ninety-nine-year lease for the excavation and management of the Suez Canal through bribery and diplomatic fraud.
    The real builders of the canal were not the French, but the Egyptian people. Twelve thousand Egyptians died in order to dig the canal. However, the Suez Canal, which the Egyptian people built with their blood and sweat on their own land, became the source of billions of dollars of wealth for Western plunderers. The former Suez Canal Company made a profit of more than 4.7 billion gold francs in sixty years, which is ten times the total cost of excavating the canal.
    However, the Egyptian people finally recovered the canal company and became the masters of their own canal. After driving away the British and French invaders, they cleared away the shameful symbol of colonialism—the Lesseps statue. They will erect a Statue of Liberty in this place to symbolize a new era of independence and freedom for the Egyptian people. (Attached pictures)

    勒赛普铜像倒下了
    12月24日，埃及英雄城市塞得港光复后的第二天，轰然一声，人们把从1899年以来一直矗立在苏伊士运河北口的法国人勒赛普的铜像炸翻了。
    勒赛普是前国际苏伊士运河公司的创办人，法国殖民者的哨兵。他是有名的暴发户，巴黎证券交易所最大的投机家之一。1854年，他在拿破仑第三的幕后合作下，用贿赂和外交上的欺诈，取得了开凿和管理苏伊士运河的九十九年租借权。
    运河的真正建造者不是法国人，而是埃及人民。埃及人民为了开凿运河，死亡了十二万人。但是，埃及人民在自己的土地上用血和汗凿成的苏伊士运河，却成了西方掠夺者亿万财富的来源。前国际苏伊士运河公司六十年来取得的利润高达四十七亿余金法郎，相当于开凿运河全部工程费用的十倍。
    但是，埃及人民终于收回了运河公司，成了自己的运河的主人。他们在赶走了英法侵略者后，清除了耻辱的殖民主义标志——勒赛普铜像，他们将在这个地方竖立自由神，以象征埃及人民独立自由的新纪元。（附图片）
