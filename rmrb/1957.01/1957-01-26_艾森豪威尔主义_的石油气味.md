    The Petroleum Smell of the "Eisenhower Doctrine"
    Wei Daoxu Wu Shenxian Yu Lisan
    In the special Middle East message that Eisenhower presented to the US Congress on January 5th, although filled with anti-Soviet and anti-communist clichés, it could not conceal the strong smell of petroleum. The message pointed out that the Middle East's oil reserves account for two-thirds of the capitalist world's total reserves. These rich oil deposits are precisely one of the targets of the Eisenhower Doctrine.
    I
    For nearly half a century, oil has become a wealth that American monopoly capital has been vying for. Regardless of whether it is inside or outside the United States, wherever there is oil, there is no shortage of the tentacles of American monopoly capital. Their oil leases and oil companies are located all over the world. They have oil investments in South America, Canada, Western Europe, Indonesia, India, Africa, Australia, and various countries in the Middle East. The scale and scope of American oil monopoly organizations are unprecedented.
    According to Citibank's August 1955 statistics, of the nineteen American manufacturing companies with assets of more than one billion US dollars, the oil industry accounted for ten. The total assets of these ten oil companies were 21.1 billion US dollars, while the combined assets of the other nine companies (steel, chemical, automobile, and aircraft, etc.) were only 18.7 billion US dollars. Among the 100 largest manufacturing companies in the United States, oil companies accounted for twenty. The total assets of these twenty oil companies were 23 billion US dollars, accounting for one-third of the total assets of the above-mentioned 100 companies.
    The New Jersey Standard Oil Company of Rockefeller, the American oil magnate, is the largest oil monopoly organization in the world, operating one-fifth of the capitalist world's oil; it has fourteen oil-producing areas, forty refineries, and three hundred and thirty-two branch companies worldwide. Its total operating income in 1954 was nearly six billion US dollars, exceeding the Canadian government's annual income and six times larger than the Venezuelan government's annual income. In 1954, the net profit of New Jersey Standard Oil Company was 585 million US dollars, which was more than the annual tax revenue of most countries in the world.
    American oil monopoly capitalists have also reached a frenzy in their capital exports overseas. In the twelve years from 1943 to 1955 alone, their overseas investment almost quadrupled. Currently, its total oil investment around the world is more than five billion US dollars, accounting for one-fifth of the total US overseas investment. The main oil-producing areas in the capitalist world are almost all under the control of American monopoly capitalists. Its oil investment in the Middle East accounts for 66% of the total investment of capitalist countries in the Middle East.
    II
    The rich oil reserves in the Middle East are regarded by American monopoly capitalists as the largest source of wealth they have encountered in recent decades. According to their latest estimates, the proven oil reserves in the Middle East have reached 230 billion barrels, about eight times the reserves in the United States, about twenty times the reserves in Venezuela, and accounting for 75% of the total reserves in capitalist countries.
    "US News & World Report" recently made such a statistic, that the average daily oil production of each oil well in the Middle East is 5,305 barrels, while the United States only has thirteen barrels, and Venezuela has 238 barrels. Among the oil wells drilled in the United States in 1955, an average of two out of every five oil wells were dry. Of the oil wells drilled in the Middle East in 1955, an average of only one out of six did not produce oil. Such a high oil production rate is rare anywhere in the world.
    The depth of general oil wells in the Middle East is less than 5,000 feet, while the depth of most oil wells in the United States has to reach 10,000 feet. In the Middle East, the average oil production per foot drilled is 13,000 barrels, while in the United States, the average oil production per foot drilled is less than 30 barrels, and even Venezuela, with its extremely rich oil production, only has 600 to 700 barrels.
    How can such a treasure not make American monopoly capital salivate? In 1928, with the support of the US government, the five major American oil companies broke through the British "Red Line Agreement" policy with the "Open Door" policy and entered the Middle East. Before 1933, the percentage of American capital in the total investment in Middle East oil was negligible. After the Second World War, American capital increased to 30%. In 1954, after the United States destroyed the Iranian oil nationalization, it announced the establishment of the so-called International Oil Consortium. The five major oil companies took 40% of Iranian oil from the British out of thin air. So far, Britain no longer has a monopoly oil company in the Middle East, while the United States has monopoly oil companies in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. American capital is expanding day by day. It is clear that British power has weakened in recent years, and American capital has gradually taken the lead.
    The seven major international oil cartels, led by the United States, have occupied all oil-producing land in the six major oil-producing countries in the Middle East (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Bahrain, and Qatar) in the form of leases. Oil leases account for 57% of the total area of ​​the six countries. Among them, the leases in Kuwait and Qatar account for 100% of the total area of ​​the two countries. The area of ​​American leases in Saudi Arabia reaches 1.14 million square kilometers, more than twice the size of mainland France, and equivalent to one-sixth of the US territory, which is the largest lease in history.
    American monopoly capitalists have extracted astonishing profits from Middle East oil. It is estimated that the profit from every dollar invested in Middle East oil is 2.5 times higher than the profit from oil investment in the Western Hemisphere. American monopoly capitalists can exploit 4,500 US dollars from each American oil worker every year, and 13,000 US dollars from each Venezuelan oil worker, but as much as 40,000 US dollars from each Kuwaiti oil worker. The average cost of extracting Middle East oil is only 0.75 to 2.4 US dollars per ton, while in the United States it costs 11 to 12 US dollars per ton. However, international oil cartels have raised the selling price of Middle East oil to the level of American oil, resulting in shockingly high oil profits. The capital of the Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO), which is completely controlled by American monopoly capitalists, is 500 million US dollars, while in 1955 alone, it made a profit of 530 million US dollars from the sale of crude oil alone, with a profit rate exceeding 100%. The capital of the Iraq Petroleum Company, in which American capital accounts for 23.75%, is 250 million US dollars, and it made a profit of 460 million US dollars in 1955, with a profit rate of 180%. The Kuwait Oil Company, in which American capital accounts for 50%, made a profit of 530 million US dollars in 1955, with a profit rate as high as 500%!
    III
    The reason why American monopoly capitalists can obtain such amazing profits in the Middle East is related to the US government's foreign expansion policy. Ten years ago, the United States engaged in the "Truman Doctrine," and now it has put forward the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine." The two successive presidents have spared no effort to exchange their reputations for oil for American monopoly capitalists, which shows how American oil monopoly capitalists are influencing the US foreign expansion policy.
    As everyone knows, the Eisenhower government has always been known as a "cabinet of big business," and among these big businesses, he has the closest relationship with oil monopoly capitalists. During the 1952 campaign, capitalists spent a total of 100 million US dollars to support Eisenhower, half of which was provided by oil capitalists (this time, the oil tycoon Rockefeller contributed the most to Eisenhower's campaign). After Eisenhower came to power, in order to repay the oil capitalists, he took a series of measures that were beneficial to the oil monopoly business. He first agreed to give the oil fields in the coastal shallows, with a shocking value of more than 300 billion US dollars, to the oil capitalists. Then, he dismissed or transferred the staff who drafted the Federal Trade Commission's oil report in 1952, because this book revealed some secrets of American oil monopoly capitalists extracting amazing profits in international oil cartels. Dulles, who represents Rockefeller's interests and served as chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation Committee, is the Secretary of State of the Eisenhower government. Hoover, a minor pawn of American oil capitalists who planned the invasion of Iran by American oil monopoly organizations in 1953, served as Under Secretary of State. Nelson Rockefeller, the young owner of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, is Eisenhower's special assistant and serves as chairman of the special committee that represents the President in formulating and researching the organizational work of government departments. Rockefeller's brother-in-law, Aldrich, chairman of Chase Bank (the host of Eisenhower's 1952 campaign), was sent to Britain as ambassador to take care of the oil interests of American capitalists overseas. Dillon, one of the founders of the American Middle East oil monopoly organization ARAMCO, served as the ambassador to France. Anderson, the boss of an oil company, became the Secretary of the US Navy, one of the largest customers of oil. Herman, president of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, served as an advisor to the National Security Council, the highest decision-making body in the United States. Vice President Nixon, who started out as an anti-communist, is also an agent for West Coast oil merchants in the United States.
    American oil capitalists not only influence government policies through some spokespersons they send to the government to hold important positions, but they also control government agencies that directly participate in policy decisions. During the Second World War, a "Wartime Oil Management Committee" was established, directly controlled by oil capitalists. In 1950, during the Korean War, a "National Defense Oil Management Committee" was established, presided over by Brown, the boss of Indiana Standard Oil Company. Although the "National Defense Oil Management Committee" is nominally a government agency, it does not receive government wages but receives subsidies from oil capitalists. The organization that currently acts as an outside activity organization for oil capitalists in Washington is called the "National Petroleum Council." Any government decision related to oil must first be consulted with the "National Petroleum Council" by the Secretary of the Interior, and it can only be implemented after the committee agrees.
    Eisenhower's relationship with oil is so deep that the interests of oil capitalists in the Middle East are naturally reflected in Eisenhower's foreign policy. The richness of Middle East oil cannot be found anywhere else in the world. The high profits of Middle East oil are also unparalleled. Although the Middle East oil was taken first by Britain, in recent years the United States has come from behind and taken the lead. Especially after the recent failure of Britain and France in the Middle East, the United States is likely to take the opportunity to completely monopolize Middle East oil.
    The Middle East has mostly deserts on the ground and more oil underground. The people of the Middle East have the right to use underground resources to compensate for the barrenness on the ground. The "Eisenhower Doctrine" cannot stop the just actions of the people of the Middle East to seek their own happiness with their own resources. His conspiracy is bound to fail.

    “艾森豪威尔主义”的石油气味
    卫道煦　吴慎娴　余立三
    在艾森豪威尔1月5日向美国国会提出的中东特别咨文里虽然充满了反苏反共的陈词谰调，但是却掩盖不住浓厚的石油气味。咨文指出中东的石油储藏量占资本主义世界全部储藏量的三分之二。这丰富的油藏正是艾森豪威尔主义的目标之一。
    一
    近半个多世纪以来，石油已成为美国垄断资本争相角逐的财富。不管美国国内国外，哪里有石油，哪里就少不了美国垄断资本的触角。他们的石油租借地和石油公司几乎遍及世界各地。他们在南美、加拿大、西欧、印度尼西亚、印度、非洲、澳洲以及中东各国都有石油投资。美国石油垄断组织规模之大，范围之广，是空前未有的。
    据美国花旗银行1955年8月的统计，美国十九家资产在十亿美元以上的制造业中，石油业就占了十家。这十家石油公司的总资产为二百一十一亿美元，而其他九家公司（钢铁、化学、汽车和飞机等）的资产合起来才只有一百八十七亿美元。在美国一百家最大的制造公司中，石油公司占了二十家。这二十家石油公司的总资产为二百三十亿美元，占上述一百家公司总资产的三分之一。
    美国石油大王洛克菲勒的新泽西美孚油公司是全世界最大的石油垄断组织，经营资本主义世界五分之一的石油；在全世界范围内共有十四个产油区、四十个炼油厂、三百三十二个分支公司。它1954年的营业总收入将近六十亿美元，超过加拿大政府的全年收入，比委内瑞拉政府的全年收入要大六倍。1954年新泽西美孚油公司的纯利为五万八千五百万美元，比世界上大多数国家的全年税收还要多。
    美国石油垄断资本家向海外的资本输出也已达到了疯狂的程度，仅仅从1943到1955年的十二年中，它的海外投资就几乎增加了四倍。目前它在世界各地的石油投资总额在五十亿美元以上，占美国海外投资总额的五分之一。资本主义世界中的几个主要产油区几乎全在美国垄断资本家控制之下。它在中东的石油投资占资本主义国家在中东投资总额的66％。
    二
    中东的丰富油藏是美国垄断资本家认为在近几十年来所遇到的最大的财富源泉。据他们最近的估计，中东已发现的石油蕴藏量达二千三百亿桶，约为美国蕴藏量的八倍，约为委内瑞拉的二十倍，占资本主义国家总蕴藏量的75％。
    “美国新闻与世界报道”最近曾作了这样的统计，即中东每个油井每天的平均产油量是五千三百零五桶，而美国只有十三桶，委内瑞拉为二百三十八桶。1955年美国钻探的油井中，平均每五个油井中有两个是干的。中东在1955年钻探的油井，平均每六个中只有一个不出油。这样高的出油率是世界上任何地方所少有的。
    中东一般油井深度都不到五千英尺，而在美国的油井深度大半都要到一万英尺。在中东每钻探一英尺的平均产油量是一万三千桶，而美国每钻探一英尺平均产油不到三十桶，石油产量极为丰富的委内瑞拉也只有六百到七百桶。
    这样的宝藏怎能不叫美国的垄断资本垂涎三尺呢？1928年美国五大石油公司在美国政府的支持下，用“门户开放”的政策冲破了英国的“红线协定”政策而打进了中东。1933年以前美国资本在中东石油全部投资中所占的百分比是微不足道的。二次大战后美国资本增加到30％。1954年美国破坏了伊朗石油国有化后，宣布成立所谓国际石油财团。五大石油公司平空从英国手中夺取了40％的伊朗石油。到目前为止，英国在中东已经没有独占的石油公司，而美国在沙特阿拉伯和巴林岛却有独占的石油公司。美国资本日在扩大中。很明显，英国势力几年来日见削弱，美国资本渐居领导地位。
    以美国为首的七大国际石油卡特尔在中东六个主要产油国（科威特、沙特阿拉伯、伊拉克、伊朗、巴林岛和卡塔尔）中以租借形式霸占了全部产油土地。六个国家土地的总面积中有57％是石油租借地。其中科威特和卡塔尔的租借地竟占它们两国总面积的100％。美国在沙特阿拉伯的租借地面积达一百一十四万平方公里，比法国本土还要大一倍多，等于美国国土的六分之一，是历史上空前的最大租借地。
    美国垄断资本家在中东石油上榨取了惊人的利润。据估计，中东石油投资中每一美元所带来的利润要比西半球石油投资的利润高二点五倍。美国垄断资本家每年从每个美国石油工人身上可以剥削到四千五百美元，从每个委内瑞拉石油工人身上可以剥削到一万三千美元，但是从每个科威特石油工人身上则可以剥削到四万美元之多。中东石油的开采成本平均每吨只合零点七五到二点四美元，而在美国则每吨要合到十一到十二美元。但国际石油卡特尔却把中东石油售价提高到美国石油售价的水平，因而石油利润高到惊人的程度。完全在美国垄断资本家控制下的阿美石油公司的资本为五亿美元，而1955年仅从出售原油一项中即获利五万三千万美元，利润率超过100％。美国资本占23.75％的伊拉克石油公司的资本为二万五千万美元，它1955年获利四万六千万美元，利润率为180％。美国资本占50％的科威特石油公司在1955年获利五万三千万美元，利润率高达500％！
    三
    美国垄断资本家所以能在中东获取如此惊人的利润是与美国政府的对外扩张政策有关。十年前美国就曾经搞过“杜鲁门主义”，而现在又抬出了所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”。前后两任总统都不惜以自己的身价为美国垄断资本家换取石油，足见美国石油垄断资本家是如何在左右着美国的对外扩张政策。
    大家知道，艾森豪威尔政府一向是以“大企业内阁”闻名于世的，而在这些大企业中他又和石油垄断资本家有着最密切的关系。1952年竞选中资本家们共破费了一亿美元为艾森豪威尔捧场，其中一半是石油资本家拿出来的（这次艾森豪威尔竞选又是石油大王洛克菲勒出钱最多）。艾森豪威尔上台后为了报答石油资本家，曾经采取了一系列有利于石油垄断事业的措施。他首先答应把轰动一时的价值在三千亿美元以上的海岸浅滩地区的油田奉送给石油资本家。接着又把1952年起草联邦贸易委员会石油报告一书的工作人员撤差或调职，因为这本书揭露了一些美国石油垄断资本家在国际石油卡特尔上榨取惊人利润的秘密。代表洛克菲勒利益并充当过洛克菲勒基金委员会主席的杜勒斯是艾森豪威尔政府的国务卿。1953年策划美国石油垄断组织侵入伊朗的美国石油资本家小走卒胡佛曾任副国务卿。美孚公司的少东家纳尔逊·洛克菲勒是艾森豪威尔的特别助理，并担任了代表总统拟订和研究政府各执行部门组织工作的特别委员会的主席。洛克菲勒的内兄大通银行董事长阿尔德里奇（1952年艾森豪威尔竞选的主持人）曾被派往英国担任大使以照顾美国资本家在海外的石油利益。美国中东石油垄断组织阿美石油公司的发起人之一狄龙曾任驻法大使。石油公司老板安德逊做了石油最大主顾之一美国海军部的部长。新泽西美孚油公司总裁赫尔曼做了美国最高决策机关国家安全委员会的顾问。以反共起家的副总统尼克松也是美国西岸石油商的代理人。
    美国石油资本家不仅仅是通过一些他们派到政府中担任要职的代言人来左右政府的政策，他们还控制有直接参与政策决定的政府机构。二次大战中曾经成立过一个“战时石油管理委员会”，由石油资本家直接控制。1950年朝鲜战争时又成立了一个“国防石油管理委员会”，由印第安纳美孚油公司老板布朗负责主持。“国防石油管理委员会”虽然名义上是政府机构，可是不领政府工资，却领石油资本家的津贴。目前充当石油资本家在华盛顿进行院外活动的组织名叫“全国石油委员会”。政府有关石油方面的任何决策必须先通过内政部长向“全国石油委员会”请教，委员会同意后才能付诸实施。
    艾森豪威尔和石油的关系是如此之深，因而石油资本家在中东的利益自然要反映在艾森豪威尔的对外政策里。中东石油之富在全世界找不到第二个地方。中东石油利润之高也是举世无双。中东石油虽被英国占先，但近几年来美国后来者居上，已挤进去居于领导地位，特别是最近英法在中东失败后，美国大有可能趁机完全独占中东石油。
    中东地面上多沙漠，地底下多石油，中东人民有权利用地下富藏来抵偿地面上的贫瘠。“艾森豪威尔主义”阻挡不住中东人民用自己的富源来谋求自己的幸福的正义行动。他的阴谋必然要失败。
