    From Frowning to Beaming with Joy
    Yang Zhaoshi, a member of the Fengshou Agricultural Cooperative in Haiyu Village, Minhou County, Fujian Province, is a young man with a lot of strength. Although he is very capable of hard work, he doesn't know how to do any technical farm work. Every year, after finishing the heavy work such as carrying soil, operating the waterwheel, and carrying rice, he is idle at home with nothing to do. Other technical tasks such as plowing fields, transplanting rice seedlings, and weeding all have to be done by hired labor. Therefore, his annual income is very low. In 1955, when he worked independently, the net income from his three mu of land was only more than nine hundred jin of grain, which was not even enough to feed his family of three! Because of this, his elderly parents frowned all day long.
    In the spring of 1956, after Yang Zhaoshi's family joined the advanced cooperative, the cooperative assigned him to do heavy work such as carrying soil, operating the waterwheel, and carrying fertilizer, based on his strength. He worked very hard, earning a total of more than 1,650 work points throughout the year. After deducting 2,045 jin of grain for the three family members' food, he also received 96 yuan, an increase of more than 123 yuan compared to when he worked independently in 1955. His father said with a beaming smile:
  “After joining the cooperative, not only does my son have support, but we two old people also have support.”

    从愁眉苦脸到喜笑颜开
    福建闽侯县海屿村丰收农业社社员杨昭仕，是个很有力气的青年人。他虽然很能干活，可是对技术性的农活却一样也不会做。每年，一做完挑土、车水、挑稻等粗活，就闲在家里没有事做了。其它如犁田、插秧、耘草等技术活，都得雇工来做。因此，每年的收入都很少。1955年单干的时候，三亩多田地纯收入只有九百多斤粮食，还不够家里三个人的口粮呢！为此，他年老的父母整天愁眉苦脸。
    1956年春，杨昭仕一家人参加了高级社以后，社里便根据他力气大的特点，分配他专门做挑土、车水、挑肥料等粗活。他干得很有劲，全年一共做了一千六百五十多个工分，劳动所得除留三个人的口粮二千零四十五斤外，还分到九十六元钱，比1955年单干时增加收入一百二十三元多。他父亲喜笑颜开地说：
  “入了社，不但孩子有依靠，我们两个老人也有依靠了。”
