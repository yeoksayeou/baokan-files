Xinhua News Agency, Moscow dispatch from TASS: The Soviet "Pravda" published an editorial on New Year's Eve, 1956, saying, "The past year of 1956 is an important milestone for mankind on their road of striving for lasting world peace." The fighters for peace saw a clear direction in the glorious and difficult path they have taken from the outlines of past events.

The editorial, titled "For the Victory of the Great Cause of Peace," said, "Consolidating and lasting peace is a beautiful ideal of mankind for generations. But this ideal has not been possible in the past. Peace has no practical pillar, and there are no obstacles to the exploiters who launch wars. Now this obstacle exists, that is, the great power of socialism and the unity of the working people of all countries. Mankind pins its hope for peace on the existence of the socialist camp, its unity and its ideological, political and economic power."

The editorial then pointed out that the growing national liberation movement in Asian and African countries has a huge impact on the development of the world situation and is constantly strengthening the forces of peace. The working class in capitalist countries and its vanguard, the Communist Party, unite the broad masses of democrats around themselves and fight for peace.

The editorial said that magnificent prospects have unfolded before all good people who are fighting for peace. The Soviet Union, following Lenin's policy of peaceful coexistence between countries, has put forward practical disarmament plans and formulated proposals to ease international tensions. The Soviet Union believes that after prohibiting nuclear weapons tests, reducing the number of armed forces and armaments of major powers, establishing strict and effective international supervision, and prohibiting and eliminating atomic and hydrogen weapons from armaments, armed forces and various armaments should be completely abolished, and countries should only retain police forces sufficient to maintain domestic security and protect borders. This is a path that is in the interests of the masses of people in all countries of the world.

Needless to say, the imperialist aggressor forces will attempt to lead mankind away from this path. The words of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are still very powerful today: "As long as capitalism still exists in the world, the reactionary forces representing the interests of capitalist monopoly organizations will still attempt to carry out military adventures and aggression in the future, and may still attempt to launch wars." Imperialism recently invaded Egypt, attempting to use force to stop the national liberation movement in Eastern countries. The counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary are an integral part of the imperialists' conspiracy against the peace and security of all countries.

The editorial emphasized that the imperialists' colonialist plans in Egypt were doomed to bankruptcy. Their evil conspiracy to instigate counter-revolution in Hungary has also gone bankrupt.

The editorial emphasized: "Maintaining vigilance against all conspiracies of the aggressors and uniting all peace forces is the guarantee of the victory of the cause of peace."

    为了伟大和平事业的胜利
    ——苏联真理报社论摘要
    新华社讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“真理报”在1956年除夕发表社论说，“已经过去的1956年是人类在他们为持久的世界和平而努力的道路上的一个重要里程碑”。为和平而奋斗的战士们从过去事件的轮廓中看到了自己所走的光荣而艰难的道路的明确方向。
    这篇题为“为了伟大和平事业的胜利”的社论说，“巩固和持久的和平是人类世世代代以来的美好的理想。但是这一理想过去一直没有实现的可能。和平没有实际的支柱，对发动战争的剥削者没有任何障碍。现在这种障碍已经有了，这就是社会主义的伟大力量和世界各国劳动人民的团结。人类把自己对和平的希望寄托在社会主义阵营的存在、它的团结一致以及它的思想的、政治的和经济的威力上”。
    社论接着指出亚非国家日益发展的民族解放运动对世界局势的发展起着巨大的影响，并且使和平的力量不断增强。资本主义国家的工人阶级和它的先锋队共产党把广大的民主人士团结在自己的周围，为和平而奋斗。
    社论说，在为和平而斗争的一切善良的人的面前展开了宏伟的远景。苏联遵循着列宁的各国和平共处的政策，提出了切合实际的裁军计划，拟定了缓和国际紧张局势的建议。苏联认为，在禁止试验核子武器、裁减大国的武装部队和军备的数量、建立严格有效的国际监督、禁止和从军备中取缔原子武器和氢武器以后，应当进一步完全取消武装部队和各种军备，各国只保留数量足够维持国内治安和保护国境的民警。这是一条符合世界各国人民群众利益的道路。
    不用说，帝国主义侵略势力将企图使人类离开这条道路。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的话今天仍然十分有力：“只要世界上还存在着资本主义，代表资本主义垄断组织的利益的反动势力今后就仍然会企图进行军事冒险和侵略，并且仍然可能企图发动战争。”帝国主义不久以前侵略了埃及，企图用武力来阻挡东方国家的民族解放运动。匈牙利反革命暴动是帝国主义者对各国和平和安全的整个阴谋的一个组成部分。
    社论强调指出，帝国主义在埃及的殖民主义计划注定是要破产的。它们在匈牙利鼓动的反革命的罪恶阴谋也破产了。
    社论强调说：“对侵略者的一切阴谋保持警惕和一切和平力量团结起来，这就是和平事业胜利的保证。”
