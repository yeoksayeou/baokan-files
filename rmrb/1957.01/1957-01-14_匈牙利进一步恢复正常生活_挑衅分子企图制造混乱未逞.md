Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 13th: Life in Hungary is continuing to normalize further. From January 10th, restrictions on power supply have been lifted in all cities and villages. This is because some mines have increased production for the first time since the events of October 23rd, and output has once again reached the planned level.

In various districts of the capital, Budapest, reconstruction work is continuing. In the Ferenc Körút district, 500 of the 830 houses destroyed in the events have been repaired so far. In two or three weeks, all damaged houses in the József Körút district will be repaired. The restoration of public transportation is also proceeding rapidly. In view of the continuous normalization of life, the business hours of shops, food stores, restaurants, and cafes in Budapest have been extended.

Recently, the workers' councils of most factories in the capital have been working hard to organize production so that the country can gradually overcome the current economic difficulties. However, some irresponsible provocateurs are creating difficulties and confusion in some workers' councils, causing divisions on issues related to wages, factory layoffs, and some personnel matters. Under their instigation, some workers' councils have announced their resignation. Thus, the provocateurs attempted to create strikes and provocations in factories without workers' councils. However, this attempt did not succeed.

The workers' council of the Csepel Iron and Steel United Factory announced its resignation a few days ago. Subsequently, the workers' councils of several departments of the factory also resigned. On the morning of the 11th, provocateurs took advantage of the resignation of the workers' council to instigate workers in several departments of the steel plant to stop work. They began to gather a group of people, first at the factory gate, then in front of the factory office building, to agitate for a demonstration and distribute provocative leaflets. They refused the order of the public security police to disperse, and several people even rushed into the office building, attempting to seize the police's weapons. In order to protect the building, the police had to use weapons to drive away the provocateurs, killing one person, seriously injuring another, and slightly injuring six.

The provocative incident caused work to stop in some factories, but the steelmaking plant and the pipe mill continued to work during the incident. After the provocative incident, all factories resumed work. The police arrested some people who did not work at the Csepel factory.

The irresponsible activities of the provocateurs have aroused the indignation of honest workers. Committee members and staff of workers' councils in many factories throughout the city (including the "Ganz" Railway Carriage Factory, whose production has returned to the level before the October 23rd events) condemned attempts to further hinder production and create unrest. They called on factory workers to continue to increase production.

### 匈牙利进一步恢复正常生活  挑衅分子企图制造混乱未逞

    匈牙利进一步恢复正常生活
    挑衅分子企图制造混乱未逞
    新华社布达佩斯13日电　匈牙利国内的生活正在继续进一步正常化。从1月10日起，动力供应的限制在一切城市和乡村都取消了，这是由于有些矿山在10月23日事件之后第一次增加了生产，产量再一次达到了计划规定的水平。
    在首都布达佩斯各个区，重建工作正在继续进行。在佩伦克—科鲁特区，到目前为止人们已经把在事件中被毁坏的八百三十座房屋修复了五百座。在两、三个星期内，约瑟夫—科鲁特区所有被破坏的房屋就将修复完毕。公共交通的恢复工作也在迅速进行。鉴于生活的不断正常化，布达佩斯的商店、食品店、饭馆和咖啡馆的营业时间都已延长了。
    最近以来，首都大多数工厂的工人委员会都在努力组织生产，以便使国家能够一步一步地渡过目前的经济困难。但是，有些不负责任的挑衅分子却在一些工人委员会中制造困难和混乱，使工人委员会在有关工资、工厂裁减职工和一些人事问题上发生分歧。有些工人委员会在他们的煽动下宣告辞职。于是，挑衅者就企图在没有工人委员会的工厂中制造罢工和挑衅事件。但是，这个企图并没有成功。
    切佩尔钢铁联合工厂的工人委员会在前几天宣布辞职。接着，这个工厂的几个部门的工人委员会也辞职了。11日早晨，挑衅者利用工人委员会的辞职在钢铁厂的几个部门内鼓动工人停工，并且开始纠集一批人首先在工厂大门口、然后在工厂办公大楼前面鼓动游行，并且散发挑衅性传单。他们拒绝公安警察要他们解散的命令，有几个人并且冲进了办公大楼，企图夺取警察的武器。警察为了保护大楼不得不使用武器来赶走挑衅分子，当时就打死了一人，另一人重伤，六个人轻伤。
    这次挑衅事件曾经使一些工厂的工作停顿下来，但是，炼钢厂和制管厂在挑衅事件发生的时候还在继续工作。挑衅事件过后所有的工厂都恢复了工作。警察逮捕了一些不是在切佩尔工厂工作的人。
    挑衅者的不负责任的活动激起了正直的劳动者的愤慨。全市许多工厂（其中包括生产已经回复到10月23日事件以前水平的“甘兹”铁路车辆工厂）工人委员会的委员和工作人员，都谴责进一步妨碍生产和制造不安的企图，并且号召工厂工人继续增加生产。
