The new American plan for aggression in the Middle East, known as the "Eisenhower Doctrine," was explained in more detail in President Eisenhower's message to Congress on January 5. This message, using a large amount of anti-Soviet and anti-communist clichés and lies that distort the situation in the Middle East as a smokescreen, asked the U.S. Congress to authorize Eisenhower to implement a four-point plan to so-called "protect" and "assist" Middle Eastern countries. The main content of this plan is to arbitrarily declare the Middle East region as its "sphere of influence," to "use U.S. armed forces" to "protect" this region; and at the same time use 400 million U.S. dollars to lure Middle Eastern countries to accept its enslaving "cooperation and assistance."

Dulles declared at a meeting of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on January 7 that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is a continuation and development of a series of aggressive plans implemented by the United States after World War II, such as the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty, and the Southeast Asia Treaty, all of which have "the most fundamental commonality."

What is the common purpose of these aggressive plans of the United States? Dulles had already explained it this way: "During the 19th century, the maintenance of peace and order was largely due to Britain. Britain's navy and its naval bases were sufficient to enable it to adapt to circumstances and act freely throughout the world." However, "the major events of the 20th century, especially the two world wars and their aftermath, have created a new situation. The United States has largely inherited the leadership responsibilities previously shared by several countries." Dulles said it so clearly that the United States' doctrines and plans after World War II were aimed at rebuilding the kind of situation in the 19th century where Britain could "adapt to circumstances and act freely" in other countries, and inherit and concentrate the rule of all other colonial countries over the world in the United States alone.

Eisenhower's message specifically applied Dulles's point of view to the Middle East. He wrote: "In the past few decades, many countries in that region have not been fully autonomous. Other countries have exercised considerable authority in that region." Now, Middle Eastern countries "are developing towards autonomy and independence," which has resulted in "unstable situations," and therefore "the responsibility undertaken by the United States has increased." How different is this view of the United States from the view of the people of the Middle East and the entire Asian and African region. The people of Asia and Africa hate foreign rule, firmly demand independence, and believe that the independence of Asian and African countries is the most important factor in maintaining peace; while the United States praises foreign rule that enslaves the people of Asia and Africa, believes that the independence of Middle Eastern countries is an "unstable situation," and requires foreign rulers to come to this region to "exercise authority." Therefore, after the recent disastrous defeat of the Anglo-French armed invasion of Egypt, the United States shouted that the weakening of Anglo-French colonial forces in the Middle East was a "vacuum," and it should quickly use American military and economic power to "fill" it.

This practice of the United States, as the Indian "Free Press" said, is to "replace the decadent and discredited colonialism of Britain and France in the Middle East with a new type of dollar imperialism." However, it should be pointed out that the "new" American imperialist policy of aggression is more sinister and despicable than the old-brand colonialism of Britain and France. In order to enslave and invade Middle Eastern countries, it can even shamelessly shout about "protecting" the "independence" of Middle Eastern countries.

Since the United States began implementing the "Truman Doctrine" in 1947, it has blown the horn of anti-Soviet and anti-communist, split the world, created the "Cold War," and, with the help of the so-called "big stick and carrot policy," forced many countries to follow it in expanding armaments and preparing for war. From expanding armaments and preparing for war, American monopoly capitalist groups earn more profits every year than they did during World War II. The imperialist forces of the United States are frantically expanding outwards. It has signed military treaties with more than forty countries, making many countries subject to American control to varying degrees. Dulles even shouted the slogan of "brink of war" in 1956, denounced "neutralism" as "immoral," and vehemently opposed peace. After the Suez Canal issue occurred, the United States took the opportunity to worsen the situation in the Middle East and encouraged Britain and France to embark on the road of war adventure. After the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt was stopped, the United States was afraid that the tension in the Middle East would ease, so it hurriedly came up with an "Eisenhower Doctrine." Bevan, one of the leaders of the British Labour Party, once pointed out that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" will be considered "another stage of the Cold War."

However, the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is more aggressive and dangerous than the previous "Cold War" policy of the United States, because it is actually a combination of the "Truman Doctrine" and Dulles's "brink of war" policy. The Eisenhower message beats the drums of anti-Soviet and anti-communist, the purpose is to deliberately spread tense atmosphere, so that it can create an excuse to interfere in Middle Eastern countries at any time.

The so-called "economic assistance plan" promoted by the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is in fact just a means for the United States to carry out aggression. Since the "Truman Doctrine" began to promote enslaving "U.S. aid" to Turkey and Greece, countries that accepted "U.S. aid" rarely did not suffer losses. Some countries were gradually pulled into a series of enslaving economic and military treaty shackles by the United States: their territory became American military bases, their resources and trade were controlled by the United States, their armies had to use American equipment and accept American training, and they were finally brought to the "brink of war" and lost their independence. Therefore, many countries are increasingly wary or deeply resentful of American "aid." The dollar has encountered many setbacks in the Middle East. Since 1953, the United States has repeatedly promoted the "Jordan River Water Utilization Plan" to Arab countries, but Arab countries believe that this is "a plan to establish foreign rule over our water sources and to facilitate American expansion in Arab countries," and therefore did not fall for it. The United States' plan to demand harsh political conditions from Egypt in the name of "aid" in building the Aswan Dam also failed. Therefore, the United States now has new methods, with the clanging of swords as a backing to force the promotion of its "aid plan." It is revealed that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" includes plans to revive the United States' past "Jordan River Water Utilization Plan," and at the same time, it is overstepping its authority to formulate a so-called "Nile River Development Plan" involving several African countries behind the countries concerned, and is also making gestures to some Middle Eastern countries individually. This is clearly not that the United States suddenly has a kind heart.

The "Eisenhower Doctrine" is proposed at this time because Britain and France have been discredited in the Egyptian incident, and the United States is attempting to take the opportunity to squeeze British and French forces out of the Middle East region. In the past few years, Britain's oil monopoly rights in the Middle East have fallen into the hands of the United States. Britain spent so much effort to occupy a seat in the Baghdad Pact, while the United States now has the possibility to completely drive Britain out of this group with one move. The Baghdad Pact has in fact become a bridgehead for the United States to use to promote the "Eisenhower Doctrine." It is natural that Britain and France feel dumbfounded about the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Under helpless circumstances, British and French officials have had to force themselves to smile and express "welcome," while the bourgeois newspapers in London and Paris have issued many arguments expressing dissatisfaction, suspicion, worry, and opposition to the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Facts will prove that the United States wants to "go it alone" in the Middle East, and Britain and France will not be willing to do so. Therefore, the United States' implementation of the greedy and insatiable "Eisenhower Doctrine" aggressive plan in the Middle East region not only seriously damages the independence and sovereignty of Middle Eastern countries, threatens peace in the Middle East, and will be strongly opposed by the people of Middle Eastern countries; but will also cause more suspicion and disputes within the imperialist camp, thereby making the American aggressive bloc even more isolated.

    “艾森豪威尔主义”的实质
    胡平
    被称为“艾森豪威尔主义”的美国侵略中东的新计划，已在1月5日的美国总统咨文中作了较详尽的解释。这个咨文以一大堆反苏反共的陈词滥调和歪曲中东局势的谎言作为烟幕，要求美国国会授权艾森豪威尔执行一个所谓“保护”和“援助”中东国家的四点计划。这个计划的主要内容，就是擅自宣布中东地区为它的“势力范围”，要“使用美国武装部队”来“保护”这个地区；同时利用四亿美元来诱迫中东国家接受它的奴役性的“合作和援助”。
    杜勒斯1月7日在众议院外交委员会会议上宣称，“艾森豪威尔主义”是第二次世界大战以后美国所实行的杜鲁门主义、马歇尔计划、北大西洋公约、东南亚条约等等一系列的侵略计划的继续和发展，它们都有着“最根本的共同点”。
    什么是美国这些侵略计划的共同目的呢？杜勒斯早就作过这样的解释：“在十九世纪期内，和平和秩序之维持，得力于英国之处良多，英国拥有的海军及其海军基地，足可使其在全世界各地随机应变，活动自如。”但是，“二十世纪发生的各项大事，特别是两次大战及其余波，已创立了一个崭新的局面。美国已大部分继承了以前是由数国分担的领导责任。”杜勒斯说得多么清楚，美国在二次大战后搞的这个主义那个计划，就是幻想重建十九世纪英国那种可以在别人的国家里“随机应变，活动自如”的局面，并且继承和集中其他所有殖民国家对世界各地的统治权于美国一身。
    艾森豪威尔的咨文就把杜勒斯的观点具体地应用到了中东地区。他写道：“过去几十年中，那个地区的许多国家都不是完全自治的。其他国家在那个地区行使了相当大的权威”，现在，中东国家“向自治和独立发展了”，结果就引起了“不稳定情况”，于是“美国承担的责任增加了”。美国的这种观点同中东和整个亚非地区人民的观点多么地截然相反。亚非人民痛恨外国统治，坚决要求独立，而且认为亚非国家取得独立是维护和平的最重要因素；而美国却歌颂奴役亚非人民的外国统治，认为中东国家取得独立就是“不稳定情况”，而必须外国统治者到这个地区来“行使权威”。因此，最近英法武装侵略埃及遭遇惨败后，美国就大喊大叫英法殖民势力在中东削弱是出现了什么“真空”，而要赶紧用美国的军事和经济力量去“填补”起来。
    美国的这个作法，正如印度“自由新闻”所说的，是想“用新式的美元帝国主义来代替英法在中东的腐朽的和名誉扫地的殖民主义”。但是，应该指出，“新式”的美国帝国主义侵略政策，比英法的老牌殖民主义更为阴险和卑鄙。它为了奴役和侵略中东国家，甚至能够厚颜无耻地叫喊什么“保护”中东国家的“独立”。
    美国自从1947年开始实行“杜鲁门主义”以来，就吹起反苏反共的号角，分裂世界，制造“冷战”，并借助所谓“大棒和胡萝卜政策”，强迫许多国家追随它扩军备战。从扩军备战中，美国垄断资本集团每年获得的利润比二次世界大战中还要高。美国的帝国主义势力疯狂地向外扩张，它已经同四十多个国家签订了军事条约，使许多国家在不同程度上受美国的控制。杜勒斯在1956年甚至喊出“战争边缘”的口号，谩骂“中立主义”为“不道德”的，极力反对和平。苏伊士运河问题发生之后，美国就借此恶化中东局势，鼓励英法走上战争冒险的道路。英法侵略埃及的战争被制止以后，美国害怕中东的紧张局势和缓下来，就赶急来了一个“艾森豪威尔主义。”英国工党领导者之一比万就曾指出，“艾森豪威尔主义”将被认为是“冷战的又一阶段”。
    但是，“艾森豪威尔主义”比美国以前的“冷战”政策具有更多的侵略性和危险性，因为它实际上是“杜鲁门主义”和杜勒斯的“战争边缘”政策的结合体。艾森豪威尔咨文中大擂反苏反共的战鼓，目的就是要故意散布紧张空气，以便它能制造随时干涉中东国家的借口。
      “艾森豪威尔主义”推销的所谓“经济援助计划”，事实上只是美国进行侵略的一种手段。自从“杜鲁门主义”向土耳其和希腊推销奴役性的“美援”开始，接受“美援”的国家很少不吃亏的。有些国家一步一步地被美国拉入了一系列的奴役性的经济条约和军事条约枷锁之中：国土变成美国的军事基地，资源和贸易被美国控制，军队必须使用美国装备和接受美国的训练，最后被带上“战争边缘”，而失去独立自主的权利。因此，许多国家越来越对美国的“援助”怀有戒心或深恶痛绝。美元在中东就碰过不少钉子。从1953年起，美国曾再三再四地向阿拉伯国家推销“利用约旦河河水计划”，但阿拉伯国家认为这是“一个建立外国对我们水源的统治以及便于美国在阿拉伯国家实行扩张”的计划，因而没有上当。美国以“援助”修建阿斯旺水坝为名向埃及索取苛刻的政治条件的计划，也未能得手。因此，美国现在就来了新的办法，刀剑铿锵地用军事威胁做后盾来强迫推销它的“援助计划”。据透露，“艾森豪威尔主义”中，就包括有复活美国过去的“利用约旦河河水计划”的打算，同时它又在背着当事国越俎代庖地拟订一个涉及非洲好几个国家的所谓“尼罗河开发计划”，另外还在向一些中东国家个别作出姿态。这显然不是美国突然有了好心肠。
      “艾森豪威尔主义”在现在这个时候提出来，是因为英法在埃及事件中声誉扫地，美国企图乘机把英法势力从中东地区排挤出去。过去若干年中，英国在中东的石油垄断权，已经落到美国手里去了。英国为了在巴格达条约中占一席位，不知费了多少手脚，而美国现在一举手就有把英国完全赶出这个集团的可能。巴格达条约实际上已变成了美国被利用来着手推行“艾森豪威尔主义”的桥头堡。英法现在对于“艾森豪威尔主义”感到啼笑皆非，这是很自然的。英法官方在莫可奈何的情况下，不得不强作欢颜表示“欢迎”，而伦敦和巴黎的资产阶级报纸对“艾森豪威尔主义”则发出了许多表示不满、怀疑、忧虑和反对的论调。事实将会证明，美国想在中东“单独干”，英法是不会甘心的。因此，美国在中东地区推行贪欲无餍的“艾森豪威尔主义”侵略计划，不但严重地损害中东国家的独立主权，威胁着中东的和平，将遭到中东各国人民的强烈反对；而且将在帝国主义阵营内部引起更多的猜忌和争吵，从而使美国侵略集团更加孤立。
