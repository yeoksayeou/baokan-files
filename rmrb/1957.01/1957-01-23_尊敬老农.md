Respecting Old Farmers
Lan Yunfeng

    In some agricultural production cooperatives, a tendency has emerged: valuing young people while neglecting older farmers. They neither involve older farmers in the leadership of the cooperative nor listen to their opinions much. In some agricultural cooperatives in Wuwei County, Anhui Province, older farmers have few opportunities to attend meetings, with some not having had a meeting in a year. Among the leading cadres of agricultural cooperatives, young people account for more than 60% in some cooperatives, adults account for more than 30%, and older people over forty years old account for less than 10% of the cooperative cadres. In the Matang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuhu County, there are thirty-three production teams and seventy-two production groups, with a total of two hundred and twenty-eight team leaders and group leaders. Among them, young people under twenty-five years old account for 54.4% of the total, adults account for 39%, and older farmers over forty years old only number fifteen, accounting for 6.6%. Among these, only Xu Liangcheng and Guo Deyi are older farmers around fifty years old. It is understood that the work of the older cooperative cadres is not bad; for example, the teams and groups led by Xu Liangcheng and Guo Deyi are doing very well in production, even better than some teams and groups led by young people. Chen Deru, the young team leader of the twelfth team of this cooperative, lacked production experience himself and did not listen to the opinions of the older farmers. Last year, during the harvesting of early rice and the transplanting of double-cropping late rice, the labor force was not organized well. Those who should have been watering the seedlings were not watering, and those who should have been pulling rice straw were not pulling, causing great losses. Some older farmers said, "The leader of production is an amateur, he doesn't see the old farmer's experience, he works hard blindly, he doesn't care if it's good or bad."
    What are the reasons for these phenomena? The main reason is that some people think that older people have "old brains," are "old conservatives," "old stubborns," etc. They always unilaterally believe that older people are "more backward" than young people. As a result, some young people, especially young cooperative cadres, look down on older people, don't pay attention to them in anything they do, and readily slap many labels on them. Consequently, some older people have neither the confidence to introduce their production experience nor the courage to speak their minds. Clearly seeing that young people are doing things wrong or not following the rules, they are unwilling to bring it up and get rebuffed, and can only stand there with a blank face and stroke their beards in silence. They say with great emotion, "Now it is the world of young people, we have nothing to say," and some also say, "Young people live happily, middle-aged people work to death, and old people are angered to death." In some agricultural cooperatives, young people and older people cannot unite with each other, which affects the production of the cooperative.
    Of course, some older people are not quick enough to accept new things, but we must not generalize and assume that old farmers are necessarily backward. Aren't many older people ahead of young people in production? We should also see that older people have these characteristics: they always consider things carefully, are unwilling to speak if they are not sure, and are unwilling to do things if they are not sure, making them more stable than young people. Some people have called these characteristics negative things such as "conservative" and "unenthusiastic," which is clearly wrong.
    We must not deny that older farmers have many advantages and special skills that young people do not possess. Older farmers are very familiar with production knowledge such as the seasonality of production, crop varieties, soil, climate, water conservancy, etc.; in life, they have excellent work styles of diligence and thrift, are shrewd and careful, understand hardship, and know how to manage a household; they also have certain work abilities and experience, and their temperament is generally more gentle than that of young people, and they are good at uniting the people around them, etc. Comrades who do rural work should not only not kick older farmers aside, but should also select some of them who are suitable to serve as cadres to participate in the leadership of the cooperative, and listen to their opinions and criticisms. For our vast number of young cooperative cadres and young cooperative members, it is not only important to respect older farmers and care for older farmers, but also to learn from them their rich production experience and life experience, in order to learn from others' strengths and make up for one's own shortcomings. Only in this way can we constantly enrich our knowledge, make ourselves progress faster, and at the same time, it will be conducive to the unity and production of the cooperative.

    尊敬老农
    蓝云峰
    在一些农业生产合作社里，出现了这样一种偏向：只重视青年人，不重视老年农民。既不吸收老年农民参加社的领导，也很少倾听他们的意见。安徽省无为县的一些农业社，老年农民很少有机会参加会议，有的一年来没有开过会。农业社的领导干部中，有些社青年占60％以上，壮年占30％以上，四十岁以上的老年担任社干部的不到10％。芜湖县马塘农业生产合作社共有三十三个生产队，七十二个生产小组，计有正副队长、组长二百二十八人。其中二十五岁以下的青年占总人数的54.4％，壮年占总人数的39％，四十岁以上的老年农民只有十五人，占6.6％，其中年到五十岁的老年农民只有许良成、郭德意两人。据了解，老年社干部工作并不坏，像许良成、郭德意两人领导的队、组生产都搞得很好，比一些青年人领导的队、组生产还强些。这个社第十二队青年队长陈德如，由于自己缺乏生产经验，又不倾听老农意见，去年在收割早稻和栽插双季晚稻的时候，劳动力就组织得不好，当车水保苗的不车水，当拉稻草的不拉稻草，造成了很大损失。有些老农说：“领导生产是门外汉，老农经验他看不见，辛辛苦苦死蛮干，是好是坏他不管”。
    产生这些现象的原因何在？主要是有些人认为老年人是“旧脑筋”、“老保守”、“老顽固”等等。总是片面的认为老年人比青年人“落后”些。于是，有些青年人，尤其是青年社干部就看不起老年人，做任何事情不把他们放在眼下，动不动还给他们扣上许多大帽子。结果，有些老年人既没有信心介绍自己的生产经验，更不敢说出自己心内的话，明明看到青年人干错了或做事不上规矩，也不愿意提出来去碰钉子，只有呆着脸翘着胡子闷在心里。他们很感慨地说：“现在是青年人的世界了，没有我们讲的话了”，也有的说：“真是快活死青年，累死中年，气死老年”。在一些农业社里，青年人和老年人互相间不能团结，以至影响到社的生产。
    当然，有些老年人接受新事物是不够快的，但决不能就此一概而论，认为老农民一定是落后的。有不少老年人在生产上不是跑到青年人的前面了吗？我们还应当看到老年人具有这样一些特点：遇事总是经过慎重的考虑，没有把握的话不愿讲，没有把握的事不愿干，比较青年人稳重。有些人把这些特点说成了“保守”、“不热情”等消极的东西，这显然是错误的。
    我们决不能够否认，老年农民有很多优点和特长是青年人不具备的。老年农民对生产的季节性、作物品种、土壤、气候、水利等等生产知识是很熟悉的；在生活上，他们具有克勤克俭、精打细算的优良作风，懂得艰难困苦，会当家过日子；他们还有一定的办事能力和经验，性情一般的较青年人温和，善于团结周围群众等等。作为做农村工作的同志，不但不能把老年农民一脚踢开，而且应该把他们中间一些适合担任干部的人选拔出来参加社内领导，多多听取他们的意见和批评。对我们广大青年社干部和青年社员来说，不仅要尊重老年农民，爱护老年农民，更重要的是向他们学习丰富的生产经验和生活经验，以取人之长，补己之短。只有这样，才会不断的丰富自己的知识，使自己进步得更快，同时也有利于社的团结和生产。
