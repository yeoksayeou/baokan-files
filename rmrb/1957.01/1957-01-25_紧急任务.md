    "Urgent Task"
    At the end of last year, the Aquatic Products Section of Hanyang County, Hubei Province, received an official letter from the Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau, stating: "The military region needs 1,000 jin of grass carp, carp, and crucian carp, each weighing more than five jin, to be delivered within two or three days...". The county's Aquatic Products Section immediately found a way to select fresh fish of the required varieties, quantities, and specifications from fresh fish production areas more than twenty li away from the county seat. They hired twelve people at a cost of one yuan and one jiao per dan to carry the fish to the county seat, and then transported them to Wuchang by civilian boat.
    After the fish were delivered to their destination, they were not weighed immediately. It wasn't until the next day that some nannies and family members came to divide them, one scale at a time. In the end, more than forty jin of fish were left and sent to the canteen of the Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau.
    Because the fish were divided in small portions and left overnight, the batch of fish lost more than sixty jin in weight. As for the price? It was two fen lower per jin than in the production area. What about the freight? The Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau took no responsibility.
    In this way, the several staff members of the county's Aquatic Products Section spent four days completing this "task" assigned by the Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau.
    Why does the Hubei Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau assign such tasks to lower levels? Jiang Xue

    “紧急任务”
    去年年底，湖北汉阳县水产科接到省水产局一份公函，内称：“军区需要每尾重五斤以上的青、草、鲤鱼一千斤，在两三日内设法送到……”。该县水产科立即设法从远离县城二十多里的鲜鱼产地，按公函中要求的品种、数量、规格，挑选了鲜鱼，并以每担工资一元一角雇了十二个人，挑运到县城，再用民船送到武昌。
    鱼送到目的地后，没有马上过秤。直等到第二天，一些保姆、家属才来一秤一秤地分。最后还剩下四十多斤鱼，送到了省水产局的食堂。
    由于鱼是零碎分的，加上放了一个晚上，结果这批鱼亏秤六十多斤。价钱呢？每斤比产地还低两分。运费呢？省水产局概不负责。
    就是这样，县水产科的几个工作人员费了四天的时间，算是完成了省水产局布置的这个“任务”。
    湖北省水产局为什么要向下级布置这样的任务呢？　江雪
