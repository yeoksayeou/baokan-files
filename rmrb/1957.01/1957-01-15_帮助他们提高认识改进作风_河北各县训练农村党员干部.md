    Helping Them Enhance Understanding and Improve Work Style
    Counties in Hebei Train Rural Party Member Cadres
    (Our Dispatch) The county committees of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province have begun training rural grassroots Party member cadres since December of last year. According to surveys in 42 counties including Mancheng, Qingxian, Chengde, Wanquan, and Wu'an, more than 9,000 grassroots Party member cadres have already been trained. Those participating in the training include secretaries and members of grassroots Party organizations, as well as responsible Party member cadres from government, mass organizations, and agricultural cooperatives.
    In recent years, rural Party member cadres in Hebei have played a significant role in building the cause of socialism. However, with the development of advanced cooperativization, many lack a correct understanding of the new situation and are unfamiliar with many of the Party's policies under the new circumstances. Some branches have confused the scope of work of the Party, government, and cooperatives, forming a situation of "cooperatives replacing the Party" and "cooperatives replacing the government," weakening the Party's leading role. In some areas, after the abolition of districts and consolidation of townships, due to the increased workload, many Party member cadres feel that their own ideological level cannot keep up with the needs of the work and lack working methods. Furthermore, many cadres believe that since advanced cooperativization has been achieved, everything will be easy to promote. They do not consult with the masses when encountering problems and only act subjectively, seriously committing the mistake of coercion and commandism. Still others feel that since advanced cooperativization has been realized and socialism has been built, they should take a break and rotate shifts, so they are not proactive in their work and are only busy earning work points for themselves. In order to overcome these ideological tendencies of grassroots Party member cadres, various counties have held training classes lasting fifteen to twenty days. In order to solve the problem that many Party members believe that the revolution was successful after advanced cooperativization and are unwilling to work or rotate shifts, the counties in Zhangjiakou Prefecture prominently carried out education on the arduousness of building socialism, causing many Party members to change their past erroneous ideas. Huang Wenji, a trainee in Chongli County, said: "In the past, I thought that the realization of advanced cooperativization meant the completion of socialism, and that I would no longer work in the future. After studying, I realized that there is still much work to be done in the future. When I go back to the village, I will properly educate Party members and take on the responsibility of building the cooperative." The trainees in Wu'an County, Handan Prefecture, due to clarifying the Party's tasks at the current stage and the principles of linking theory with practice and seeking truth from facts, many trainees automatically examined their own ideological shortcomings and found the root cause of not acting according to reality. Many trainees in various regions believe that to follow the mass line, it is necessary to firmly establish a mass viewpoint, consult the masses when encountering problems, and frequently accept the supervision of Party members and the masses, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and always pay attention to overcoming complacency and the bad tendency of acting arbitrarily.
    After returning to their villages from training, many trainees began to change their work style. Many Party member cadres responsible for cooperatives have reviewed and summarized their cooperative work over the past year, humbly listened to the opinions of the cooperative members, and laid the foundation for democratic cooperative management. In Wotou Village, Qingxian County, seven grassroots Party member cadres who thought there was nothing to do after advanced cooperativization became active in their work again after receiving training. Party member Tan Fengyuan took the lead in selling 400 catties of surplus grain and expressed his determination to fight to the end for the realization of socialism and communism. (Li Pu)

    帮助他们提高认识改进作风
    河北各县训练农村党员干部
    本报讯　中共河北省各县委员会，从去年12月起开始训练农村基层党员干部，据满城、青县、承德、万全、武安等四十二个县了解，现已训练基层党员干部九千多人。参加训练的除基层党组织的书记、委员外，还有政权、团体以及农业社的负责党员干部。
    河北农村的党员干部，几年来在建设社会主义事业上起了很大作用，但是随着高级合作化的发展，不少的人对新情况缺乏正确的认识，对党在新形势下的很多政策也不熟习。一些支部混淆了党、政、社的工作范围，形成了“以社代党”、“以社代政”，削弱了党的领导作用，有些地区在撤区并乡以后，由于工作任务的增大，许多党员干部感到本身思想水平赶不上工作需要，缺乏工作办法。还有不少的干部以为高级合作化了，一切事情都很好推行，遇事不和群众商量，只凭主观办事，严重地犯了强迫命令的毛病；更有的觉着实现了高级合作化，建成了社会主义，应当歇歇劲换换班了，于是工作不主动，只是忙着自己挣工分。为了克服基层党员干部这些思想倾向，各县都举办了十五至二十天的训练班，张家口专区各县为了解决许多党员认为高级合作化后革命成功而不愿再工作和换班的思想，突出地进行了建设社会主义艰巨性的教育，使许多党员改变了过去的错误想法。崇礼县学员黄文吉说：“过去认为实现高级合作化后，就是建成社会主义了，今后不再做工作了，学习后才知道今后工作还多哩，回村去要好好教育党员，把建社责任很好的担起来。”邯郸专区武安县的学员，由于明确了党在现阶段的任务和理论联系实际、实事求是的道理，很多学员都自动检查自己思想上的缺点，找出了不按实际办事的病根。许多地区的学员都认为，要走群众路线必须坚决树立群众观点，遇事向群众请教，经常接受党员群众的监督，开展批评和自我批评；时刻注意克服骄傲自满情绪和独断专行的不良倾向。
    学员们受训回村后，很多人开始转变自己的工作作风。不少在社里负责的党员干部检查总结了一年来的办社工作，虚心听取了社员的意见，打下了民主办社的基础。青县窝头村有七个在高级合作化后认为没事可干的基层党员干部，受训回去以后，工作又积极了起来。党员谭凤元带头卖余粮四百斤，并表示要为实现社会主义和共产主义奋斗到底。　（李朴）
