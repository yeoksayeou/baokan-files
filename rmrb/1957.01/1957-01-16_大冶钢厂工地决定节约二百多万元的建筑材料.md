Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 15th: The construction units responsible for the expansion project of Daye Steel Plant have initially drafted technical measures for saving building materials this year. According to these measures, steel, cement, and wood worth more than 2 million yuan can be saved this year.

Since the third quarter of last year, the builders of the Daye Steel Plant expansion project have carried out work to save building materials, and have promoted a number of effective advanced experiences and new technologies, saving more than 400 tons of steel, more than 500 tons of cement, and more than 1,000 cubic meters of wood. Considering the difficult material supply situation this year and the fact that the potential for saving building materials has not been fully exploited, they began compiling this year's saving technical measures in December last year. To this end, the Daye Branch of Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation established a steel-saving group and a construction planning group. The steel-saving group, in reviewing engineering drawings, put forward more than 80 rationalization proposals for modifying designs, which were approved by the design department, and can save 1,500 tons of steel.

    大冶钢厂工地决定节约二百多万元的建筑材料
    新华社武汉15日电　担负大冶钢厂扩建工程的施工单位，已经初步拟定出今年节约建筑材料的技术措施。根据这些措施，今年将能节约价值两百多万元的钢材、水泥和木材。
    大冶钢厂扩建工程的建筑者们，从去年第三季度以来开展了节约建筑材料的工作，曾经推行了多项行之有效的先进经验和新技术，节约了四百多吨钢材、五百多吨水泥和一千多立方公尺木材。他们考虑到今年材料供应困难的状况，以及节约建筑材料的潜力还没有充分发挥，从去年十二月就开始编制今年的节约技术措施。武汉冶金建筑总公司大冶分公司为此成立了节约钢材小组和施工规划小组。节约钢材小组在审核工程图纸中，并提出经设计部门同意的八十多条修改设计的合理化建议，能节约钢材一千五百吨。
