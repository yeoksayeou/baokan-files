Xinhua News Agency report:

    Return One, Settle One; Settle One, Unite One
    Hebei, Jiangsu, and Yunnan Properly Resettle Demobilized Soldiers
    According to Xinhua News Agency, over 98% of the demobilized soldiers who returned to Hebei Province in 1956 have been properly resettled, and the remaining personnel are also being resettled.
    In the work of resettling demobilized soldiers, the People's Committees and agricultural production cooperatives in various townships of Hebei Province put forward the slogan "Return one, settle one; settle one, unite one." Some of the demobilized soldiers who returned to their hometowns became leading cadres of townships and cooperatives, while others became work recorders, accountants, technicians, and health workers. Some demobilized soldiers who were weak and had insufficient labor were also given special care by the agricultural cooperatives. According to statistics from 106 counties including Zunhua, local agricultural cooperatives subsidized more than 210,000 workdays to more than 7,900 disabled soldiers of the third class and demobilized soldiers (including family members), ensuring that their living standards were not lower than those of ordinary members.
    Local governments helped demobilized soldiers returning to cities with specialized skills and a certain level of education to find employment, and also provided them with training and education so that they could quickly become familiar with their work.
    Some sick demobilized soldiers received treatment from the health departments. Another 414 disabled soldiers and demobilized soldiers who were elderly, frail, and had no one to support them were placed in provincial sanatoriums, convalescent homes, and reformatories.
    Because various localities attached great importance to the work of resettling demobilized soldiers, more than 40 model units for resettling demobilized soldiers, such as Kailuan Coal Mine and Da Xing Yarn Factory, and more than a dozen model counties and model townships, such as Funing County and Baixiang, emerged. More than 9,800 demobilized soldiers were elected as activists in socialist construction in production and work.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, of the 28,988 demobilized construction soldiers who returned to Jiangsu Province last year, more than 99% have now been properly resettled.
    More than 76% of the resettled demobilized soldiers participated in agricultural production. All the demobilized soldiers who returned to Dantu County joined agricultural production cooperatives. More than 3,900 demobilized soldiers who returned to Yancheng, Guanyun, and Lishui counties served as chairmen of agricultural cooperatives, production team leaders, accountants, technicians, and militia and security personnel. When resettling demobilized soldiers, many agricultural cooperatives made appropriate divisions of labor according to each person's specific circumstances and expertise.
    Some demobilized soldiers with certain technical expertise were assigned to work in various industrial and mining enterprises and other units. Many units prioritized the employment of demobilized soldiers. A few units were criticized and corrected by local party committees and governments for adopting an attitude of exclusion and refusal to accept demobilized soldiers.
    These demobilized soldiers generally maintained and carried forward the spirit of overcoming difficulties and forging ahead courageously, actively worked, and made many achievements in various tasks.
    Last year, the province allocated more than 860,000 yuan to subsidize many demobilized soldiers who had difficulties in production and life after returning to their hometowns. The counties under the Yangzhou Special District built more than 2,700 houses for demobilized soldiers. After more than 70 old Red Army soldiers and soldiers of the Old Third Division were demobilized and returned to their hometowns in Funing County, the local government also sent people to express their condolences.
    This newspaper reports that 99.6% of the large number of demobilized construction soldiers who returned to Yunnan Province in 1956 have been properly resettled.
    All localities have attached importance to the resettlement of demobilized soldiers. After March of last year, when a large number of demobilized soldiers returned to their hometowns one after another, various localities carried out resettlement according to the needs of the construction cause and their personal circumstances. The vast majority of demobilized construction soldiers maintained and carried forward the glorious tradition of the People's Army, and a large number of activists and backbone figures emerged in various construction undertakings. The demobilized construction soldiers who attended the county-level congress of activists in socialist construction for family members of revolutionary martyrs, family members of military personnel, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers alone numbered 5,990. Seven thousand six hundred and forty-eight demobilized construction soldiers in thirteen counties including Wuding, Yao'an, and Fumin in Chuxiong Special District participated in production cooperatives. Among them, more than 5,000 were elected as township cadres, township people's representatives, cooperative directors, various activists, and production models. (Yang Shuchang)

    回来一名安置一名　安置一名团结一名
    河北江苏云南妥善安置复员军人
    据新华社讯　1956年回到河北省的复员军人，98％以上已经得到妥善安置，其余人员也正在安置中。
    河北省各地乡人民委员会和农业生产合作社在安置复员军人工作中，提出了“回来一名安置一名，安置一名团结一名”的口号。回乡的复员军人有的当了乡和社的领导干部，有的当了记工员、会计、技术员和保健员。一些体弱和劳力不足的复员军人，也得到农业社的特别照顾。根据遵化等一百零六个县的统计，当地农业社共补助给七千九百多名三等残废军人和复员军人（包括家属）二十一万多个劳动日，保证他们的生活水平不低于一般社员。
    回到城市的具有专门技术和一定文化水平的复员军人，各地政府都帮助他们就业，并且对他们进行培养和教育，使他们很快地熟悉了业务。
    一些患病的复员军人得到了卫生部门的治疗。还有四百十四名年老体弱无人赡养的残废军人和复员军人，分别被收容在省休养院、疗养院和教养院里。
    由于各地对安置复员军人工作比较重视，出现了开滦煤矿、大兴纱厂等四十多个安置复员军人模范单位和抚宁县、柏乡等十几个模范县和模范乡。有九千八百多名复员军人在生产和工作中当选为社会主义建设积极分子。
    据新华社讯　江苏省在去年复员回来的二万八千九百八十八名复员建设军人中，目前已经有99％以上得到妥善安置。
    被安置的复员军人中有76％以上参加了农业生产。回到丹徒县的复员军人全部加入了农业生产合作社。回到盐城、灌云、溧水三个县的复员军人中有三千九百多人担任了农业社的社长、生产队长、会计、技术员和民兵、治安员。许多农业社在安置复员军人时，都根据各人的具体情况和专长适当分工。
    一些具有某种技术专长的复员军人，被安置到各工矿、企业等单位工作。许多单位都做到了优先录用复员军人。也有个别单位因为对复员军人采取排斥和拒绝接受的态度，受到了当地党委和政府的批评和纠正。
    这些复员军人在各项工作中一般都保持和发扬了军人克服困难、勇往直前的精神，积极工作，并且作出了许多成绩。
    去年全省拨出八十六万多元，补助许多回乡后在生产上和生活上有困难的复员军人。扬州专区所属各县就为复员军人建造了二千七百多间房屋。阜宁县有七十多名老红军和老三师的军人复员回乡后，当地政府还派人去慰问。
    本报讯　1956年回到云南省的大批复员建设军人，99.6％都已得到适当安置。
    各地对复员军人的安置工作是重视的。在去年3月以后，当大批复员军人陆续回乡时，各地都根据建设事业的需要和本人情况，分别进行安置。复员建设军人绝大部分都保持和发扬了人民军队的光荣传统，在各项建设事业中，涌现出了大批的积极分子和骨干人物。仅出席县级烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员建设军人社会主义建设积极分子大会的复员建设军人，就有五千九百九十人。楚雄专区的武定、姚安、富民等十三县七千六百四十八个复员建设军人参加了生产合作社。其中被选为乡干部、乡人民代表、社主任和各种积极分子、生产模范的有五千余人。　（杨树昌）
