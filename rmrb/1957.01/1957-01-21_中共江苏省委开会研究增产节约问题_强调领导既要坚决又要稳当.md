    The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Holds Meeting to Study Increase Production and Practice Economy
    Emphasizing That Leadership Should Be Both Resolute and Steady
    (Our Nanjing dispatch) The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a meeting of the municipal party secretaries of Nanjing, Xuzhou, and ten other cities, as well as the industrial directors of various regional committees, to study the issues of increasing production and practicing economy in industrial and mining enterprises.
    According to the reports from various cities, the leading cadres of factories and mines still have some ideological misgivings about carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy. Some believe that this year there will be difficulties with materials and insufficient tasks, making it impossible to increase production. Others think that increasing production and practicing economy is an old concept with nothing new. The meeting analyzed the reasons for these ideological concerns: some factory and mine cadres only consider the development of their own factories and rarely consider the connection between their factories and other aspects of economic construction, as well as the difficulty of raw materials. Therefore, after the tasks were reduced, the sentiment of "it is easy to start a project, but difficult to stop it" arose. The meeting believes that this year, systematic education on current events and policies must continue to be carried out among the cadres of factories and mines to improve their class consciousness and advocate the style of leading by example, being hardworking and simple, and sharing weal and woe with the masses. In this way, the movement to increase production and practice economy can be built on a solid foundation.
    The meeting also believes that this year, in carrying out the work of increasing production and practicing economy in factories and mines, several policy boundaries must be clearly defined. First, actively strive to increase production when conditions are available in terms of raw materials, power, and market. All enterprises should especially promote "good" and "saving," and oppose blindly pursuing a "gust of wind" regardless of conditions. Second, the technical transformation of enterprises must realistically consider the conditions of investment, materials, and labor, and make reasonable arrangements, especially for small factories and handicrafts in local industries. They should not emphasize modernization and mechanization but should pay attention to maintaining and fully utilizing existing equipment. Third, it is necessary to promote actively finding ways to solve the difficulties of raw materials, but oppose engaging in unscrupulous practices. The departmentalism of some factories currently concealing the bottom of their inventory must be overcome. Fourth, the issue of streamlining enterprise organizations must first be investigated and studied, and then specific arrangements should be made based on the situation of each factory, opposing blind and chaotic streamlining.

    中共江苏省委开会研究增产节约问题
    强调领导既要坚决又要稳当
    本报南京讯　中共江苏省委最近先后召开了南京、徐州等十二个市的市委书记和各地委工业部长会议，研究工矿企业增产节约问题。
    据各市反映，厂矿领导人员对开展增产节约运动，在思想上还有某些疑虑。有的认为今年材料困难，任务不足，无法增产；有的认为增产节约是老一套，没有什么新内容。会议分析这些思想顾虑的原因是：有些厂矿干部只考虑本厂发展，很少考虑本厂和经济建设中其他环节的联系和原材料的困难。因此在压缩任务之后，产生了“上马容易下马难”的情绪。会议认为今年必须继续在厂矿干部中进行系统的时事政策教育，提高干部的阶级觉悟，提倡以身作则艰苦朴素和群众同甘苦的作风，然后再进一步提高群众的觉悟。这样，增产节约运动才能建筑在稳固的基础上。
    会议还认为，今年在厂矿中开展增产节约工作，必须划清几道政策界限。第一、在原料、动力和市场有条件的情况下，积极争取增产。所有的企业都要特别提倡“好”和“省”，要反对盲目地不顾条件地“一阵风”。第二、对企业的技术改造必须实事求是地考虑投资、材料和劳动力等方面的条件，合理安排，尤其是地方工业的小厂和手工业，不应强调现代化和机械化，而应注意保养和充分利用现有设备。第三、提倡积极想办法解决原材料的困难，但是要反对不择手段的乱搞。目前有些工厂对外隐瞒仓底的本位主义思想必须克服。第四、企业机构的精简问题，必须先调查研究，然后根据各厂情况具体安排，反对盲目乱简。
