Xinhua News Agency, 29th. The People's Liberation Army units have drawn vehicles and ships to support transportation.

    The General Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has allocated fifteen covered vehicles, ready to participate in the busy passenger transport during the Spring Festival under the unified dispatch of the Beijing Automobile Transportation Company. In the past forty days, a certain motor vehicle unit has dispatched more than 16,000 vehicles, transporting more than 111,000 tons of construction materials for various construction sites in Beijing. In order to speed up vehicle turnover, the drivers also took the initiative to help workers load and unload materials. The troops stationed in Tianjin also sent 103 vehicles and 91 horse-drawn carts to support transportation in the city. From November last year to now, they have transported a total of 370,000 ton-kilometers of materials. The East China Sea Fleet of the Navy dispatched six landing ships in September last year to support emergency transportation on the Yangtze River. After completing their tasks recently, they returned to their original units. These landing ships sailed between important ports such as Shanghai, Hankou, Yichang, and Chongqing, with a total transport volume of 75,555,000 ton-kilometers in three months.
    PLA units have also postponed the shipment of many materials originally scheduled to be transported by rail during the Spring Festival until after the Spring Festival, so that the railway can carry more passengers and daily necessities for the people.

    抽调车辆船只听候调度
    解放军各部队支援交通运输
    新华社29日讯　中国人民解放军各部队抽调车辆、船只支援交通运输。
    中国人民解放军总后勤部已经拨出十五辆带篷的汽车，随时准备在北京市汽车运输公司的统一调度下，参加春节期间的繁忙客运。某汽车部队四十多天来，已经出动汽车一万六千多台次，为北京市各建筑工地运送建筑材料十一万一千多吨。驾驶员们为了加速车辆周转，还主动帮助工人装卸物资。驻天津部队也派出汽车一百零三辆和马车九十一辆支援市内运输。从去年11月到现在，他们共运输物资三十七万吨公里。海军东海舰队在去年9月间派出六艘登陆舰，支援长江紧急运输，最近在完成任务以后返回原部。这些登陆舰分别航行在上海、汉口、宜昌、重庆等重要港口之间，三个月中运输量共达七千五百五十五万吨公里。
    解放军各部队还把许多原定在春节期间由铁路运输的一些物资，推迟到春节以后起运，以便让铁路载运更多的旅客和人民日用必需品。
