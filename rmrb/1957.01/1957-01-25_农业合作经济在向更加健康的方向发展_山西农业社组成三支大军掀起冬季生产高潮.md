The agricultural cooperative economy is developing in a healthier direction.
Shanxi agricultural cooperatives form three armies to launch a winter production upsurge.

(Our report) According to the Shanxi Daily: The second year of the advanced agricultural cooperativization in Shanxi Province has seen a winter production upsurge that is now arriving in most regions. Compared with the winter production upsurge immediately following cooperativization in the winter of 1955, it has different characteristics, showing that the agricultural cooperative economy is developing in a healthier direction.

Simultaneously emphasizing and integrating sideline production, basic farmland construction, and spring plowing preparation, promoting the comprehensive development of the agricultural economy in a rich and varied manner, is the most significant characteristic of this province's previous stage of winter production. The conscientious implementation of this approach has been enthusiastically supported by the broad masses of cooperative members, thereby mobilizing their enthusiasm for participating in winter production. In the Changzhi area, 91% of agricultural cooperatives, after comprehensive planning for winter production, have organized over 90% of the male labor force and 40% of the female labor force to participate in the winter production movement. Among these laborers, approximately 45% are engaged in preparing for this year's agricultural production, 30% are dedicated to basic farmland construction, and 25% are engaged in sideline production. Although the proportion of laborers participating in various production activities in other regions' agricultural cooperatives may vary, they have all formed three armies, simultaneously marching towards spring plowing preparation, basic farmland construction, and sideline production.

The achievements in winter sideline production far exceeded those of the first winter of cooperativization. By the end of last December, with the exception of the Jinnan area, the average winter sideline income per cooperative member household in the other four special districts reached approximately ten yuan. In agricultural cooperatives that suffered from disaster and reduced production, winter sideline income was even higher. In Hequ, thirty cooperatives that suffered reduced production earned 21,208 yuan from sideline production in November and December, making up for 87.7% of the losses from last year's agricultural production reduction, with an average income of thirteen yuan per household; except for twelve cooperatives that did not fully make up for their losses due to severe disasters, the remaining eighteen cooperatives were transformed from reduced production cooperatives to increased income cooperatives. Thanks to the vigorous development of sideline production, coupled with state assistance, the difficulties faced by 98,000 seriously affected disaster victims and 270,000 lightly affected disaster victims in the Yanbei area in terms of food rations and winter clothing before this year's spring plowing and sowing have been basically resolved. In general increased production cooperatives, the development of winter sideline production not only met the needs of cooperative members for daily pocket money and preparing for the Spring Festival, but also enabled the various agricultural cooperatives in Huguan to use 23.7% of their winter sideline income to purchase 186 large livestock, 99,400 jin of chemical fertilizer and soybean cake, 19 double-shared plows, and over 3,000 pieces of old-fashioned farm tools.

Preparations for this year's agricultural production generally started earlier than last year. In terms of manure accumulation, a wave has been formed throughout the province. Huguan has accumulated an average of 74 dan and a half of fertilizer per mu of autumn land, accounting for 93% of the winter manure accumulation plan, while at the same time last year (referring to early January), only 55 dan had been accumulated. The entire Changzhi area has accumulated an average of 48 dan of fertilizer per mu of autumn field, reaching more than half of the original plan. Last year, the phenomenon of fertilizer not being delivered to the fields in many places after the start of spring directly affected the quality of autumn field sowing. While launching a manure accumulation upsurge, several counties in the Jinnan area organized labor to deliver fertilizer early. Counties such as Hejin, Jieyu, and Yongji adopted the method of accumulating and delivering fertilizer simultaneously, and have already delivered approximately 30% of the fertilizer to the fields.

Various localities also regard protecting livestock safely through the winter as an important part of preparing for this year's agricultural production. The universal early start and good execution of this task is a new phenomenon that has not appeared in previous winters. At the end of autumn and the beginning of winter, various counties made specific arrangements, and subsequently organized inspections and livestock protection observation and evaluation activities. The Xin County area originally had 2,247 cooperatives lacking 160 million jin of grass. Since the beginning of winter, 140 million jin of grass has been harvested, basically meeting the needs of livestock fodder. Various agricultural cooperatives in the Changzhi area have successively built over 10,000 new livestock pens, repaired over 22,700 old pens, and installed 92,000 curtains and 18,800 papered windows for the livestock pens, and installed over 9,000 stoves, turning cold pens into warm pens. In addition, the winter irrigation in the Yanbei area, the management of winter wheat fields in the Jinnan area, and the allocation of high-quality seeds are also more active than in previous years.

In terms of basic farmland construction, although the quantity is less than in the winter of 1955, special attention is paid to improving the quality of the projects. Before starting construction projects in many places, attention is generally paid to consulting with experienced farmers, combining top-down and bottom-up planning, careful surveying, and training technical personnel for agricultural cooperatives. In Yushi County, a total of 109 cooperatives organized over 9,500 laborers to participate in activities such as digging pits to plant trees, building terraced fields, and building reservoirs; to ensure improving the quality of the projects, 94% of the cooperatives implemented the "four fixed" contracting method and strictly established an acceptance system; by the end of last December, the completed projects could control soil erosion over an area of more than 100,000 mu. The progress of various projects is also relatively fast. The small-scale water conservancy projects that have been completed and are under construction throughout the province can increase the irrigated area by more than 800,000 mu, accounting for 53.3% of this year's plan; the Yanbei area has achieved greater results, expanding the irrigated area by 262,000 mu. Soil and water conservation construction work is no less than in the winter of 1955. Since the beginning of winter, the various projects completed in the Jinnan area can control soil erosion over an area of 969,000 mu; while from the winter of 1955 to the end of March last year, the projects completed to control soil erosion covered an area of 522,000 mu. According to incomplete statistics throughout the province, the soil and water conservation projects that have been completed and are under construction since the end of the autumn harvest can control an area of 3.59 million mu.

Another characteristic of the winter production upsurge in most areas that is different from the first winter of cooperativization is that cooperative members' household sideline businesses have developed, and a lot of fuel has been accumulated. According to statistics from 621 cooperatives in the Xin County area, since the beginning of winter, collectively operated sideline businesses account for 68%, and sideline businesses operated by cooperative members individually account for 32%. In particular, the enthusiasm of cooperative members for developing pig raising has soared to unprecedented heights. By the end of last November, Yuchi County had 190,000 pigs, an increase of more than 47,000 from the end of September; by the end of last year, Changzhi County had 180,000 pigs, an increase of 67% compared with the same period in 1955.

While organizing winter production, cooperatives also paid attention to rationally arranging the lives of cooperative members, which is an important aspect of ensuring the development of production. In terms of fuel accumulation, the achievements far exceeded those of the winter of 1955. In Yuchi County, each agricultural cooperative household has generally accumulated four to eight months' worth of fuel; in counties such as Linyi, Hongzhao, Fushan, Anze, and Shilu in the Jinnan area, 240 million jin of coal and firewood have been collected, averaging 1,400 jin per household, enough for four months of consumption.

Currently, in a small number of areas in Shanxi Province, due to lax leadership or poor overall arrangements for winter work, the winter production of some agricultural cooperatives is still in a state of spontaneous or semi-spontaneous development. This situation should be immediately inspected and corrected to catch up.

    农业合作经济在向更加健康的方向发展
    山西农业社组成三支大军掀起冬季生产高潮
    本报讯　据山西日报报道：山西省高级农业合作化第二年的冬季生产高潮，目前在大多数地区已经到来。它和1955年冬刚刚合作化以后的冬季生产高潮比较，有着不同的特点，显示出农业合作经济在向更加健康的方向发展。
    副业生产、农田基本建设、春耕准备等三项工作同时并重，互相结合，丰富多采地全面发展农业经济，是这个省前一段冬季生产的最显著特点。这个方针的认真贯彻执行，得到了广大社员群众的热烈拥护，由此调动了他们参加冬季生产的积极性。长治区91％的农业社，经过冬季生产全面规划，有90％以上的男劳力、40％的女劳力，有组织地投入冬季生产运动。在这些劳力中，约有45％的劳力是进行今年农业生产准备工作，30％的劳力专搞农田基本建设，25％的劳力经营副业生产。其它地区的农业社参加各种生产的劳力比例虽有不同，但都组成了三支大军，分别向春耕准备、农田基本建设、副业生产同时进军。
    冬季副业生产成绩，远远超过了合作化第一年冬季。到去年12月底，除晋南区以外，其它四个专区的冬季副业收入，平均每户社员达到十元左右。在受灾减产的农业社里，冬季副业收入更多。河曲三十个减产社，11、12两月，副业生产收入两万一千二百零八元，补起去年农业减产损失的87.7％，每户平均收入十三元；除十二个社因遭灾过重没有完全补起损失以外，其余十八个社都由减产社变成增收社。由于大力发展了副业生产，加上国家的扶助，雁北区九万八千重灾民，二十七万轻灾民，今年春耕播种前的口粮、寒衣困难，已经基本上解决。在一般增产社里，冬季副业生产的发展，不光满足了社员日常零花钱和准备过春节用钱等需要，壶关各个农业社，还用冬季副业收入的23.7％，购买大牲口一百八十六头，化学肥料和豆饼九万九千四百斤，双铧犁十九部，旧式农具三千多件。
    今年农业生产准备工作，一般比上一年提早了一步。在积肥方面，已在全省范围内形成热潮。壶关每亩秋地平均已积肥七十四担半，占冬季积肥计划的93％，而去年同期（指1月初），才积到五十五担。长治区全区每亩秋田已平均积肥四十八担，达到原计划的半数以上。去年开春以后有许多地方曾经发生肥料送不到地的现象，直接影响了秋田播种质量，晋南区若干县在掀起积肥热潮的同时，组织劳力提早送肥，河津、解虞、永济等县采用随积随送的办法，已经把30％左右的肥料送到地里。
    各地还把保护牲畜安全过冬，作为准备今年农业生产工作中的一项重要内容，普遍动手早，做得好，是往年冬季所没有出现过的新现象。秋末冬初，各县即具体布置，中途又组织检查和保畜观摩评比。忻县区原有两千二百四十七个社缺草一亿六千万斤，入冬以来已打草一亿四千万斤，基本上满足了牲畜饲草需要。长治区各个农业社，先后新建畜圈一万多间，补修旧圈两万二千七百多个，并给畜圈挂帘子九万二千个，糊窗户一万八千八百个，生火炉九千多个，冷圈变成暖圈。此外，雁北区的冬浇、晋南区的过冬麦田管理，以及调剂优良种籽等工作，也比往年活跃。
    在农田基本建设方面，在数量上虽然比1955年冬季减少，但特别注重了提高工程质量。不少地方在建设工程动工前，一般都注意和老农商量，上下结合全面规划，仔细勘察，训练农业社的技术人员。榆社全县一百零九个社共组织了九千五百多个劳力投入挖坑植树、修梯田、打蓄水池等活动；为保证提高工程质量，94％的社推行了“四定”包工办法，严格建立验收制度；到去年12月底，所完成的工程可控制水土流失面积十万多亩。各项工程的进展速度也是比较快的，全省已经完成和正在兴修的小型水利工程，可增加水浇地八十多万亩，占今年计划的53.3％；雁北区成绩较大，扩大水浇地二十六万二千亩。水土保持建设工作，并不亚于1955年冬季。晋南区入冬以来所完成的各项工程，可控制水土流失面积九十六万九千亩；而1955年冬到去年3月底，完成控制水土流失面积的工程是五十二万二千亩。全省不完全统计，在秋收结束以来，已经完成治理和正在动工的水土保持工程，可控制面积三百五十九万亩。
    多数地区出现的冬季生产高潮，还有和合作化第一年冬季不同的另一个特点，这就是社员家庭副业有了发展，积的燃料也很多。据忻县区六百二十一个社的统计，入冬以来的副业收入，集体经营的占68％，社员个人经营的占32％。特别是社员发展养猪的积极性空前高涨。榆次区到去年11月底，喂养毛猪达到十九万多口，比9月底前增加了四万七千多口；长治区去年年底养猪已达到十八万口，比1955年同期增加67％。
    合作社在组织冬季生产的同时，还注意了合理安排社员生活，这是保证发展生产的一个重要的方面，以积燃成绩来说，大大超过了1955年冬季。榆次区各个农业社，一般每户都已积下四至八个月的烧燃；晋南区临猗、洪赵、浮山、安泽、石楼等县，拉煤积柴二亿四千万斤，每户平均有一千四百斤，够四个月需用。
    当前山西省少部分地区，由于领导上抓的不紧，或者是整个冬季工作安排的不好，有些农业社的冬季生产还陷于自流或半自流状态，这种状况，应当立即检查纠正，迎头赶上。
