    The Rubber-Tapping Girl
    Huang Shan
    One clear morning, the eastern sun had just risen. In the dense rubber forest, clear singing could be heard. A group of young Miao girls, carrying buckets for holding latex, were tapping the trees for their sap, singing as they worked. The rubber tree bark was gently cut with knives, and the thick white sap seeped out like fresh milk. One girl secretly smiled, and the comparison amused all the girls. She said, "This latex is like grandma, even sweeter and more fragrant than grandma. Ah Ma, you are the youngest among us, come and taste it, is it fragrant?" Ah Ma refused to give in: "Sister Ah Xia, you are as old as the rubber tree. The rubber tree produces snow-white milk every day, but do you have as much milk as it?" Everyone laughed heartily, and Ah Xia's face turned as red as fire. She picked up her bucket and chased after Ah Ma, who ran away carrying a full bucket of latex.

    割胶的姑娘
    荒山一个晴朗的早晨，东方的太阳刚刚升起，在密密的橡胶林里，传来了清脆的歌声。一群年轻的苗族姑娘，手提着盛胶桶儿，正在割取树上的胶汁，边割边唱。橡胶树皮用刀儿轻轻地划破，渗出浓白的胶汁像鲜奶一样；一个姑娘偷偷笑了，一个比喻逗笑了所有的姑娘。她说，“这胶汁可像奶奶呀，它比奶奶还要甜香，阿玛呀，咱这些人中数你年小，你快来尝尝呀，香不香？”阿玛听了不肯让步：“阿夏姐，你年纪和胶树一般大，胶树天天流下雪白的奶，你的奶可有这么多？”大家都哈哈笑了，阿夏的脸儿红红的像火烧；她提起桶来朝阿玛追去，阿玛提着满桶胶汁跑了。
