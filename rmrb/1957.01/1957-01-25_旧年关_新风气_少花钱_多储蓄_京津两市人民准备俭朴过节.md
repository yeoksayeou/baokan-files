Xinhua News Agency, January 24th - The people of Beijing are promoting the fine tradition of hard work and thrift, changing the historical pattern of "more withdrawals than deposits" in bank savings business before the Spring Festival.

These days, as the Spring Festival approaches, the market is full of Spring Festival goods, allowing people to choose whatever they want. However, in larger savings offices, they are still as crowded as usual with people making deposits. Many workers and citizens are depositing all the money they can save into banks. In the ten days before the Spring Festival, bank deposit balances increased by 1.25 million yuan compared to the end of 1956. This is clearly different from the situation during the Spring Festival last year, when bank deposit balances decreased by 1.77 million yuan after offsetting deposits and withdrawals. In the twenty days before this year's Spring Festival, the number of deposits withdrawn by depositors was only one-third of the same period last year, and large withdrawals were even less frequent.

After entering the fourth quarter of last year, Beijing's bank savings business developed significantly. In many factories and enterprises, the number of people participating in savings reached more than 80% of the total number of employees. Deposits increased month by month, and by the end of the year, the deposit balance reached more than 166.66 million yuan. Many savings account holders have converted current deposits into fixed deposits, and 75% of the bank's deposit balance is in fixed deposits. This has extended the average use of this capital by the state from 91 days to 153 days.

The bank savings business has also been improved to adapt to this development trend. The savings professional meeting held in October last year decided to strengthen the publicity work of grassroots organizations and social connections. To facilitate the masses, many grassroots savings institutions have been added. Now there are 240 savings offices and 214 savings agencies in the city. In the urban area, there are an average of four savings units in every square kilometer.

According to the Tianjin Daily: A thrifty Spring Festival atmosphere is growing among the citizens of Tianjin. Many people are depositing money they don't need temporarily or have saved by buying things into banks. According to statistics from the Savings Department of the Municipal People's Bank, as of the 18th of this month, the city's people's savings deposits had reached 86.19 million yuan, an increase of 190,000 yuan compared to the end of last year, reversing the usual phenomenon of more payments than receipts before the Spring Festival in previous years.

After the Tianjin Business Office of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau paid salaries in January, more employees participated in savings than in any of the previous eight months. Sun Fengzhen, a cadre of the Tianjin Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, originally planned to withdraw 50 yuan of fixed savings and 48 yuan of zero-deposit lump-sum prize savings that had matured to buy a new overcoat for the Spring Festival. Later, she considered that she already had a coat and didn't need to buy a new one urgently, so she took out another two yuan and re-deposited the mature money together into a fixed deposit of 100 yuan. Su Shaozhen, a member of the No. 3 Embroidery Production Cooperative in Heping District, recently planned to buy more chicken, fish, and meat to eat on "Po Wu" (the fifth day of the Lunar New Year) and buy some clothes and accessories for her children, planning to spend a total of 80 yuan, because her husband, who had been unemployed for many years, got a job, and her salary also increased. After hearing the publicity about hard work and thrift, she decided to save more than 50 yuan and deposited the money into the bank at that time.

### 旧年关  新风气  少花钱  多储蓄  京津两市人民准备俭朴过节

    旧年关  新风气  少花钱  多储蓄
    京津两市人民准备俭朴过节
    新华社24日讯　北京人民发扬艰苦朴素的优良作风，改变了春节前银行储蓄业务上“取多存少”的历史规律。
    这几天春节已经临近，市场上的春节商品可说是样样俱全，任人选购。但是在较大的储蓄所里，却还是像平日一样挤满了存款的人，不少职工和市民把凡能节省的钱都存到银行里去了。春节前十天银行存款余额比1956年年底又增加了一百二十五万元。这同去年春节时的情形显然不同，那时银行存款余额除存取相抵外，还下降了一百七十七万元。今年春节前二十天提储户提取存款的数字，仅为去年同期的三分之一，大额提款更少。
    进入去年第四季度以后，北京的银行储蓄业务有了很大发展。不少工厂企业参加储蓄的人达到了职工总数的80％以上。存款逐月上升，到年底存款余额达到一亿六千六百六十六万多元。有不少储蓄户把活期存款改为定期存款，银行的存款余额中，有75％是定期存款。这就使得国家对于这笔资金的利用平均由九十一天延长到一百五十三天。
    银行储蓄业务也适应这种发展趋势作了改进。去年10月召开的储蓄专业会议，决定加强基层组织的宣传工作和社会联系。为了便利群众，增加了许多基层储蓄机构，现在全市有储蓄所二百四十个，储蓄代办所二百一十四个。在城区，平均每一平方公里内就有四个办理储蓄的单位。
    本报讯　据天津日报消息：在天津市市民中间，俭朴过春节的风气正在增长，不少人把暂时不用的或买东西节省下来的钱存到银行里。据市人民银行储蓄部统计：到本月18日，全市人民储蓄存款已达到八千六百一十九万元，比去年年底增长了一十九万元，改变了往年春节前照例付多收少的现象。
    北京电业局天津营业所1月份发薪后，职工参加储蓄的比以往八个月任何一月都多。天津市民主妇女联合会干部孙凤珍原来准备把已到期的定期储蓄五十元和零存整取有奖储蓄四十八元一起取出买一件新大衣过春节穿，后来她考虑已有外衣，不一定急着买新大衣，于是又拿出两元钱，和到期的钱一并转存了一百元的定期储蓄。和平区第三刺绣生产合作社社员苏绍珍最近因为她失业多年的丈夫有了工作，自己的工资也提高了，打算在今年春节多买些鸡鱼肉吃到“破五”，再给孩子们买点穿的戴的，计划一共花八十元。当她听了艰苦朴素的宣传以后，她就决定省出五十多块钱，当时就把这笔钱存到银行里了。
