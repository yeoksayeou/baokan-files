Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 23rd. According to a report by the Czechoslovak News Agency on the 22nd: The joint statement issued after the talks between the Czechoslovak Communist Party delegation and the French Communist Party delegation stated that the talks between the two parties were conducted in an atmosphere of friendship and fraternal unity. The delegations of the two parties exchanged views on the international situation, some issues of the international workers' movement, and the relationship between the people of Czechoslovakia and France. They also studied the issues of further developing the relationship between the two parties and exchanging experiences. They expressed satisfaction with the complete agreement of both parties on the issues discussed during the talks.

The first part of the joint statement discussed the current international situation. The statement pointed out that the aggression against Egypt launched by France and Britain using Israel had failed. The Algerian question also urgently needs a peaceful solution.

In Hungary, the counter-revolutionary riots instigated by international and domestic reactionaries have been defeated by the best forces of the Hungarian people. The Soviet Union's assistance to Hungary in this event is a historically significant achievement. The two parties stated that they fully support the efforts made by the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government.

The joint statement then condemned the "Eisenhower Doctrine," pointing out that it is an attempt by American monopoly capital to replace the colonialist robber position of British and French imperialists in the Near and Middle East.

The two parties support the efforts of the people of the Middle East and North Africa to obtain and consolidate national independence and sovereignty, and support their efforts to repel all new conspiracies of imperialist interference in their internal affairs.

The statement said that the United States and the West German group are taking advantage of the European people's concentration on the Middle East situation to accelerate West Germany's remilitarization. It has reached the point where the United States is considering equipping the West German army with atomic weapons, and the "European Atomic Energy Community" enables West Germany to manufacture weapons of mass destruction by relying on French uranium mines and French scientific inventions.

The Czech and French people have had very painful experiences with German militarism in the past, and they cannot but be deeply disturbed by the development of West Germany and the French government's support for the revival of German militarism. Therefore, the two parties condemn everything that contributes to the revival of West German militarism, just as they condemned the French and Czechoslovak bourgeoisie's surrender in Munich in 1938.

The two parties believe that countries bordering West Germany bear a particularly important responsibility in the struggle against the threat of revanchist forces. They have a serious political task of acting in unison to ensure that Germany no longer threatens their freedom and the peace of Europe.

The delegations of the two parties expressed that they fully value the efforts made by the German Democratic Republic and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to establish a democratic and peace-loving Germany. Only by abandoning the policy of West German remilitarization and only by reaching an understanding between the two Germanys can a correct solution to the German question be obtained that conforms to the national interests of the German people and their neighbors.

On the issue of easing international tensions, the two parties believe that the Soviet Union's proposal of November 17, 1956, on easing international tensions is of great significance.

The third part of the statement talked about the important significance of the activities of the Communist and Workers' Parties. The two parties believe that in the struggle for world peace, in the struggle of the working people in capitalist countries for rights and improved lives, and in the efforts of the people in socialist countries to build a new society, the activities of the Communist and Workers' Parties are of decisive importance. The closest unity of the worldwide communist movement on the basis of Marxist-Leninist principles and unwavering loyalty to proletarian internationalism are of very important significance. They welcome discussions and talks held by representatives of communist parties of various countries on this basis and in this spirit.

The world's reactionary forces are fully aware of the decisive role that a united international working-class movement can play in thwarting their plans. Therefore, it is exhausting all means to undermine this unity, weaken the communist parties of various countries, and disorient their members; therefore, it supports and propagates various revisionist tendencies.

The statement said that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the decisive force of the working-class movement and socialism throughout the world. It was and still is the center of the international communist movement and an inexhaustible source of common experience for all proletarian revolutionary parties. And the differences in the political and economic conditions of various countries, the differences in national characteristics, and the different traditions of the working-class movement are all factors that the communist parties of various countries must consider when formulating policies in order to successfully complete their missions.

The last part of the joint statement pointed out that although the current situation of Czech-French relations has improved to a certain extent, it is disproportionate to the traditional friendship between the two countries. The two parties will continue to work to further improve this relationship, which is in the interests of the people of both countries and is an important contribution to strengthening peace in Europe.

The delegations of the two parties unanimously agreed that the two fraternal communist parties should continue to strengthen their friendly ties with many years of tradition. In the course of their history, the two parties have repeatedly solved similar problems in the struggle against opportunism and sectarian tendencies and upholding the Leninist line. And now, they are also carrying out a joint struggle for the purity of Marxist-Leninist thought, against revision and distortion of Marxism-Leninism.

Although the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the French Communist Party work in different environments, mutual exchange of experience is still beneficial and effective for them. Therefore, the delegations of the two parties have decided to take measures to exchange experiences and strengthen cooperation.

    捷法两党代表团发表联合声明
    支持匈牙利社会主义工人党和革命政府。谴责“艾森豪威尔主义”。反对西德军国主义复活。世界共产主义运动的国际主义团结有非常重要的意义。苏联共产党是国际共产主义运动的中心。两党正在为马克思列宁主义思想的纯洁和反对修正主义而进行共同的斗争。
    新华社布拉格23日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社22日讯：捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表团和法国共产党代表团会谈后发表的联合声明说，两党之间的会谈是在友好和兄弟团结的气氛中进行的。两党代表团就国际局势，国际工人运动的一些问题，捷克斯洛伐克和法国人民的关系问题交换了意见。他们还研究了进一步发展两党之间的关系和交流的经验问题。他们对在会谈中在所讨论的问题上双方意见完全一致表示满意。
    联合声明的第一部分谈到了目前国际局势的问题。声明指出，法国和英国利用以色列发动对埃及的侵略已经失败。阿尔及利亚问题也迫切需要和平解决。
    在匈牙利，国际和国内反动派煽起的反革命暴乱已经被匈牙利人民最优秀的力量所击败。苏联在这次事件中对匈牙利的帮助是一个有历史意义的功绩。两党表示，它们充分支持匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府所作的努力。
    联合声明接着谴责了“艾森豪威尔主义”，指出它是美国垄断资本想取代英法帝国主义者在中近东的殖民主义强盗地位的一种企图。
    两党支持中东和北非人民获得和巩固民族独立和主权的努力，支持他们击退帝国主义干涉他们内政的一切新阴谋的努力。
    声明说，美国和西德集团正在利用欧洲人民集中注意中东情况之时来加速西德重新军国主义化。事情已经到了这样的地步：美国正在考虑用原子武器装备西德军队，“欧洲原子联营组织”使西德能够靠法国的铀矿和法国的科学发明来制造大规模毁灭性武器。
    捷法两国人民过去对德国军国主义有过非常惨痛的经验，他们对西德的发展和法国政府对德国军国主义复活的支持，不能不引起深切的不安。因此，两党谴责有助于西德军国主义复活的一切事情，正像它们在1938年谴责法国同捷克斯洛伐克的资产阶级在慕尼黑投降的行为一样。
    两党认为，在反对复仇主义势力的威胁的斗争中，同西德相邻的国家负有特别重大的责任。它们负有一致行动以确保德国不再威胁它们的自由和欧洲的和平的严重政治任务。
    两党代表团表示，它们充分重视德意志民主共和国和德国统一社会党为了建立一个民主的和爱好和平的德国所做的努力。只有放弃了西德重新军国主义化的方针，只有两个德国达成了谅解，才能获得符合德国人民和他们的邻国的民族利益的解决德国问题的正确办法。
    在关于缓和国际紧张局势的问题上，两党认为苏联1956年11月17日的关于缓和国际紧张局势的建议具有重大的意义。
    声明的第三部分谈到共产党和工人党活动的重要意义。两党认为，在争取世界和平的斗争中，在资本主义国家劳动人民争取权利、改善生活的斗争中，以及在社会主义国家人民建设新社会的努力中，共产党和工人党的活动都具有决定性的重要意义。全世界共产主义运动在马克思列宁主义原则的基础上取得最密切的团结、毫不动摇地忠于无产阶级国际主义，是有非常重要的意义的。他们欢迎各国共产党代表在这种基础上、本着这种精神举行讨论和会谈。
    世界反动势力充分意识到一个团结一致的国际工人阶级运动在挫败他们的计划方面所能起的决定性作用。因此，它正在用尽各种方法来破坏这种团结，削弱各国共产党、使它们的党员迷失方向；因此它支持并且宣传各种修正主义倾向。
    声明说，苏联共产党是全世界工人阶级运动和社会主义的决定性力量。它过去是而且现在仍然是国际共产主义运动的中心、是一切无产阶级革命政党共同经验的取之不尽的源泉。而各国的政治和经济条件的不同，民族特点的不同，工人阶级运动传统的不同，也都是各国共产党为了能够顺利完成自己的使命而在制订政策时必须考虑到的因素。
    联合声明的最后部分指出，捷法两国关系的目前情况虽然有了一定的改善，但是同两国的传统友谊也是不相称的。两党将继续努力来进一步改善这种关系，这是符合两国人民的利益的，并且也是对加强欧洲和平的一个重要贡献。
    两党代表团一致同意，两个兄弟共产党将要继续加强它们有了多年传统的友好联系。两党在它们历史过程中，在反对机会主义和宗派主义顷向、坚持列宁主义路线的斗争中，曾经多次解决类似的问题。而现在，它们也在为马克思列宁主义思想的纯洁，反对修正和歪曲马克思列宁主义而进行共同的斗争。
    虽然捷克斯洛伐克共产党和法国共产党在不同的环境下工作，但是，互相交流经验对它们还是有益的和有效的。因此，两党代表团已经决定着手采取措施来交流经验和加强合作。
