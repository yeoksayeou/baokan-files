    The Bike Speeds Down the Street
    Jinan Post Office Yun Qu

    Facing the morning breeze, bathed in the morning sun, my bike speeds down the streets in the early morning. A bag on my back, a basket on the bike, I deliver newspapers – people's daily spiritual nourishment. Pairs of eyes eagerly await, pairs of hands warmly receive the newspapers, as if greeting a dear friend.
    "Look! Xinjiang has discovered another largest oil field."
    "Ah! Our country has given birth to another mechanized factory."
    Looking at these joyful faces, my bike quickly rides forward.

    车儿飞奔在街道上
    济南邮局　云衢迎着晨风，披着朝阳，车儿飞奔在清晨的街道上。背上一包，车上一筐，我投递着报纸——人们每天的精神食粮。一双双眼睛殷切地盼望，一双双手儿亲切地接过报纸，像是接待亲爱的朋友一样。“看！新疆又发现
    一个最大的石油矿。”“啊！我国又诞生了
    一个机械化的工厂。”我看着这些欢欣的面庞，车儿飞快地骑向前方。
