After Reading "People Who Parrot Others"
　　Liu Yuxin

The People's Daily published a short article on November 22, 1956, on the third page, co-authored by Wang Quan and Sun Defu, entitled "People Who Parrot Others," which criticized a comrade who only stayed at home for less than six hours for making the mistake of listening to only one side of the story. I think this criticism is not entirely appropriate or comprehensive.

Of course, listening to only one side and believing it is wrong. Because the various things in real life are inherently extremely complex and tortuous, and the essence of things is often hidden within various phenomena. If you only hear a little or see a little, and fail to see the whole picture and the essence, you will see things in a biased way and even be misled by false appearances. Therefore, we should strive to be comprehensive in observing things and strive to see the essence through the phenomena. To achieve this, first, we must have a correct stance and correct thinking methods, otherwise we will see things that are originally "very good" as "very bad." Secondly, we must also have a working style that is good at going deep into reality for investigation and research. However, it is impossible to require everyone to do this. Therefore, our Party and government do not demand that all criticisms from below must be comprehensive and 100% correct, but rather welcome and value all opinions from the masses. Our Party and government have always regarded criticism from the masses as an important aspect of overcoming bureaucracy and improving work.

As a cadre of a state organ, it is completely necessary and correct to promptly report the situation and problems of the local Party's work that he saw when he returned to his hometown to the leading organs. Even if the situation he reflects has some discrepancies with the facts or is one-sided, he should not be blamed. Because the comrade who returns to his hometown has limited time to stay at home, limited contact, and limited level in all aspects, it is difficult to see things so comprehensively. However, no matter what, it is better to reflect his observations in accordance with normal procedures than to remain silent.

Of course, I must also say that as a person who reports the situation, he should not listen to only one side and believe it, and it is best to listen and see more, strive to be comprehensive, and truthfully report his observations to the leading organs without exaggeration.

    读了“人云亦云的人”以后
    刘俞新
    1956年11月22日人民日报第三版发表了一篇王权、孙德福合写的题为“人云亦云的人”的短文，批评了一个只在家里呆了不到六个小时的同志犯了偏听偏信的毛病。我认为这个批评是不尽妥当和不够全面的。
    偏听偏信当然不对。因为现实生活中的各种事物，本来是极其复杂曲折的，事物的本质往往是隐藏在各种现象里头。如果只是听到一点，或看到一点，而看不到全面和本质，就会把事情看偏，甚至被假象所迷惑。因此，我们观察事物应该力求全面，力求能够透过现象看到本质。要作到这一点，首先得有正确的立场和正确的思想方法，否则就会把本来是“好得很”的事，看成“糟得很”。其次还得有善于深入实际调查研究的工作作风。但是，不能要求所有的人都作到这样。因此，我们的党和政府并不苛求来自下面的批评意见都必须是全面的、百分之百正确的，而是对所有来自群众的意见都十分欢迎和重视。我们的党和政府一向把来自群众的批评意见作为克服官僚主义和改进工作的一个重要方面。
    作为一个国家机关的干部，能够把他回乡所看到的当地党的工作情况和问题及时地向领导机关反映，是完全必要和正确的。即使他所反映的情况同事实有些出入，有些片面，也不应该去责难他。因为回乡的同志在家里呆的时间有限，接触的面有限，各方面的水平有限，很难把事情看的那么全面。但是，不管怎样，他能够按照正常的程序把自己的所见所闻反映出来，总比缄默不言好。
    当然，话又得说回来。作为反映情况者来说，他应该不偏听偏信，最好能多听听，多看看，力求全面，毫不夸张，实事求是地把自己的所见所闻反映给领导机关。
