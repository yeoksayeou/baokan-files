Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, January 26th: The people of Lüda City will celebrate the Spring Festival with the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lüda through many rich and varied activities. Currently, a Young Pioneers art troupe composed of children is performing慰问 performances for the troops. Workers from some large factories in the city are also preparing to welcome the soldiers to visit the factories. Many middle and primary school students will also go to the army barracks to extend their regards to the People's Liberation Army.

The PLA troops stationed in Lüda and the people of Lüda have established extremely close ties. In the past year or so, the PLA troops stationed in Lüda have donated cash that could buy more than 1,000 double-wheeled double-shared plows, which were given to more than 160 agricultural producers' cooperatives near their garrisons. The soldiers also voluntarily helped the farmers with sowing, harvesting, and various field work. Sailors often braved dangerous seas to rescue fishermen when they were attacked by wind and waves. Many military doctors in the troops also often treated villagers for illnesses. One army medical worker, Kang Zhongqi, has cured more than 90 residents of their illnesses. When the wife of Liu Yanzhen, a worker in the Lüshun area, had a postpartum hemorrhage, three sailors with the same blood type volunteered to donate blood to save the life of the critically ill woman after hearing about the situation.

The PLA troops stationed in Lüda have also received support and love from the people of Lüda. Villagers often saved the newly harvested peanuts and sweet potatoes for the soldiers to taste the new crops. During festivals, the soldiers are also invited to visit villagers' homes. When the troops were short of vegetables, fishermen rowed small boats to buy vegetables for the troops from dozens of miles away. The women here usually competed to wash and mend clothes and socks for the soldiers, and the elderly cared for the young soldiers' health like their own children.

    旅大军民建立亲密联系
    新华社旅大26日电　旅大市人民将以许多丰富的活动项目和中国人民解放军驻旅大部队一起欢度春节。目前，一个由少年儿童组成的红领巾艺术团正在为部队作慰问演出，市内一些大工厂的职工也在准备接待战士们到工厂参观，许多中、小学的学生还将到驻军营房去慰问解放军。
    驻旅大部队和旅大人民之间建立了极其亲密的联系。近一年多来，驻旅大部队捐献了可买一千多台双轮双铧犁的现款，分别赠送给驻地附近的一百六十几个农业生产合作社。战士们还义务帮助农民们播种、收割和做各种田间工作。水兵们常在渔民受到风浪袭击的时候冒着危险出海抢救。部队中的许多军医还经常为村民们治病，一位军队的医务人员康忠琦已经为九十几个居民治好了病。旅顺地区的工人刘延镇的妻子产后大出血，血型相同的三个水兵听说这个情况后，立刻自愿前去输血，拯救了这个垂危产妇的生命。
    驻旅大部队的战士们也受到了旅大人民的支持与爱戴。村民们经常留着刚出地的花生和地瓜给战士们尝新，节日里，战士们还应邀到村民家里去作客。当部队蔬菜不足的时候，渔民们划着小船，到几十里以外为部队买菜。这里的妇女平时都抢着替战士们洗补衣服和袜子，老人们也像关心子女一样地关心年轻战士的寒暖。
