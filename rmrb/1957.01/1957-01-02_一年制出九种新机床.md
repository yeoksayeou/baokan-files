Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 31st - The Soviet-style medium-sized planer and Soviet-style double-column single-crank closed press, successfully trial-produced by the state-owned Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Factory in December 1956, have been technically appraised in detail and found to meet quality standards. Both of these machine tools are highly electrified. The medium-sized planer is manufactured according to Soviet new product drawings and can process workpieces under six meters and weighing ten tons.

Also successfully trial-produced in December was the 7256 gantry planer. This machine tool can plane large workpieces (castings and forgings) weighing up to twenty tons, and two vertical tool rests and two side tool rests can participate in planing simultaneously.
