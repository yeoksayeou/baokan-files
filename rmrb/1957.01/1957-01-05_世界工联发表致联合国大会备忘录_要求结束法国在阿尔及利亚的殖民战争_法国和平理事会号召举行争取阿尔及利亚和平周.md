Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 4th. According to TASS: The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) issued a memorandum to the United Nations General Assembly on January 3rd.

The memorandum stated that the WFTU, representing 88 million members, expressed satisfaction with the UN General Assembly's unanimous adoption of the decision to include the Algerian issue on the UN General Assembly's agenda.

The WFTU believes that only a complete ceasefire in Algeria can open the way for negotiations with the true representatives of the Algerian people who are fighting for dignity and freedom. Such negotiations can only succeed if the Algerian people's desire for independence is sincerely recognized. The World Federation of Trade Unions hopes that the United Nations will use all means to end the suffering of the Algerian people and the enslavement that has caused them so many sacrifices, and will fully support the national demands of the Algerians.

The memorandum also condemned the French government's destructive war against the Algerians, its police persecution, and the mass arrests of Algerians. Although the policy of strength has been undeniably bankrupt, the French authorities, regardless of their own statements, are still intensifying their suppression and taking increasingly cruel measures against those who condemn the war policy.

The memorandum concluded by saying that the WFTU deeply hopes that the United Nations will use its authority to end the bloodshed in Algeria and will take all necessary measures to ensure that the requirements of the United Nations Charter, which recognize the right of all peoples to self-determination and the peaceful settlement of disputes, are realized.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 3rd. According to TASS: The French National Peace Council has called on the French people to hold a Week of Action for Peace in Algeria across the country from January 20th to 27th.

The statement by the French National Peace Council pointed out that this call has received a broad response from the French people. It pointed out that more than two million French men and women have already signed national petitions calling for peace in Algeria.

    世界工联发表致联合国大会备忘录
    要求结束法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民战争
    法国和平理事会号召举行争取阿尔及利亚和平周
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社布拉格讯：世界工会联合会3日发表了致联合国大会的备忘录。
    备忘录说，世界工联代表八千八百万会员对联合国大会一致通过关于把阿尔及利亚问题列入联合国大会议程的决定表示满意。
    世界工联认为，只有在阿尔及利亚实现完全停火，才能打开道路同为尊严和自由而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民的真正代表举行谈判。这种谈判只有在忠诚地承认阿尔及利亚人民要求独立的愿望的情况下才能成功。世界工会联合会希望，联合国将利用一切手段，来终止阿尔及利亚人民的灾难和使他们遭受牺牲的奴役，并且完全支持阿尔及利亚人的民族要求。
    备忘录还谴责了法国政府对阿尔及利亚人进行毁灭性战争、警察迫害和大批逮捕阿尔及利亚人的行为。虽然实力政策已遭到无可争辩的破产，但是法国当局却不顾它自己所说过的话，仍然加紧镇压和采取越来越残酷的手段来对付那些谴责战争政策的人。
    备忘录最后说，世界工联深深希望，联合国将会利用它的权威来结束在阿尔及利亚的流血，并将采取一切必要的措施使联合国宪章的承认各民族自决权和用和平方法解决争端的要求得以实现。
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社巴黎3日讯：法国全国和平理事会号召法国人民从1月20日到27日在全国各地举行争取阿尔及利亚和平周。
    法国全国和平理事会的声明指出，这个号召得到了法国人民广泛的响应。它指出，目前已经有二百多万法国男女在全国请愿书上签了名，要求在阿尔及利亚建立和平。
