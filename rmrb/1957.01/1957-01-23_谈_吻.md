    On "Kiss"
    The Sichuan poetry monthly "Stars" published a poem titled "Kiss" in its January issue. I was quite surprised when I read it. Fortunately, this poem is not long, allow me to transcribe it below:
  Like holding a brimming goblet of grape wine
  I hold your pair of dimpled cheeks
  Drinking it all in one gulp
  Drunk, drunk!
  Like a bee clinging to the stamen of a rose
  I suck from your bright red
  Lips, drawing
  Honey, honey!
  Like twin apples
  Hanging on a green leafy branch
  We silently
  Kiss, kiss!
    The reason I was surprised is certainly not because the author wrote about love. Love is, and always will be, one of the important themes of literary creation. In China and abroad, in ancient and modern times, there have been many excellent works with love as their subject matter. People gain tremendous spiritual strength from these literary works reflecting love lives. What surprised me was why this poem is written so emptily, so boringly, so banally. I ask, what valuable thing can readers extract from this poem? This poem contains nothing but nauseating words and phrases. I see no great difference between this poem and the decadent music and erotic yellow poetry that has long been abandoned.
    Since the slogan of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend was put forward, works of various genres and styles have appeared more than before, and the scope of subjects has also expanded. This is a good phenomenon and should be welcomed. However, no matter how different the styles of literary works are, and no matter what subject matter is adopted, there is a principle that should be followed, that is, it must be beneficial to the people and should have healthy thoughts and feelings: it should either cultivate people's noble sentiments or improve people's aesthetic abilities. But what positive ideological significance and healthy emotion does this poem "Kiss" contain?
    Living in an era of earth-shattering revolutionary struggles and socialist construction, still facing infinitely rich real life, let us write more things with positive significance!

### 谈“吻”

    谈“吻”
    四川的诗歌月刊“星星”1月号上登了一首题名为“吻”的诗。我读了竟感到有些惊异。好在这首诗并不长，容我把它照抄在下面：
  像捧住盈盈的葡萄美酒夜光杯
  我捧住你一对酒窝的颊
  一饮而尽
  醉，醉！
  像蜂贴住玫瑰的蕊
  我从你鲜红的
  唇上，吸取
  蜜，蜜！
  像并蒂的苹果
  挂在绿荫的枝头
  我俩默默地
  吻，吻！
    我所以感到惊异，当然不是因为作者写的是爱情。爱情，它永远是文学创作的重要主题之一。我国和外国，古代和现代，都曾经出现过许多优秀的以爱情为题材的作品。人们从这些反映爱情生活的文学作品里，感受到巨大的精神力量。我所感到惊异的是，这首诗为什么竟写得这样空虚，这样无聊，这样陈腐。试问，读者能从这首诗里吸取到什么有价值的东西呢？这首诗除了一些使人感到肉麻的词句之外，再无其他。我看不出这首诗和早已被人唾弃的那种靡靡之音，逗人情欲的黄色诗词有什么太大的不同。
    自从提出百花齐放、百家争鸣的口号之后，各种体裁、各种风格的作品较之以前更多地出现了，题材的范围也扩大了。这是一种好现象，是应当欢迎的。但是，不管文学作品的风格如何不同，也不管采取何种题材，却有一条准则应当遵循，即必须有益于人民，应当具有健康的思想感情：或能培养人们的高尚情趣，或能提高人们的美感能力。可是像“吻”这首诗究竟含有什么积极的思想意义和健康的感情呢？
    生活在惊天动地的革命斗争和社会主义建设的时代，还是面对无限丰富的现实生活，多写一些具有积极意义的东西吧！
