    On "Under the Shanghai Eaves"—Letter to a Friend
    Li Jianwu
    Your letter mentioned "Under the Shanghai Eaves." Suddenly, it came alive before my eyes. "Under the Shanghai Eaves" is one of Xia Yan's masterpieces. He wrote several good plays about Shanghai, touching almost every corner, but "Under the Shanghai Eaves" is particularly meaningful to me. So, when you said that this play is going to be performed by the China Youth Art Theatre, my joy immediately overflowed.
    This is a group play where every character has their moment. It best illustrates the characteristics of Xia Yan's plays. It is a play worth learning from for the next generation of playwrights.
    Because firstly, his material always closely relates to life, and it is rare to see him make exaggerated or unrealistic mistakes. And Shanghai's alley life is the life he is most familiar with. He wrote about the face of this semi-colonial metropolis. There is no corner of Shanghai that he is unfamiliar with, especially the corners of the petty bourgeoisie. "Under the Shanghai Eaves" depicts these petty bourgeoisie living under the eaves and intellectuals who have been seriously tainted with petty-bourgeois habits.
    Because secondly, he never stands on the sidelines and lists facts when using materials. He has a purpose. He has put a lot of effort into selecting. His plays are concise and have the clearest feeling. This clear feeling is not only an achievement of skillful technique, but also a harvest of firm thought. In fact, we know that thought often determines the use of technique.
    At first glance at "Under the Shanghai Eaves," readers easily get the impression of a fragmented and then continuous picture. The reason is that this is a cross-section of a lane house, except for the loft, except for the small room at the top of the stairs (with the window facing us), every room is in front of us, and the stories of every room are in front of us. So, the stories sometimes proceed separately in form, and sometimes intersect (the small patio and back door therefore appear lively, and this is also the case in reality). The feeling of intersection easily produces the impression of fragmentation and continuity.
    Soon this impression will disappear. Soon, these life phenomena will be broken open, and a heartbreaking force will emerge, drawing us into the question of why these poor people are so pitiful. How did they become like this? Is it really the structure of the house that makes them have to live under the same roof?
    No! Absolutely not!
    A playwright can use anything to complete the thematic task he has arranged for himself. Xia Yan used the structure of Shanghai's lane buildings and even more so the overcast and rainy weather of Shanghai's plum rain season. The continuous rain "affects the mood of these residents."
    But is the "low pressure" limited to this?
    The playwright tells us that the story takes place in April 1937. Who can forget this year? Soon after, it was the July 7th Incident. Soon after, the earth-shattering heroic event of the Chinese Communist Party calling for resistance to Japan broke out. Before the incident, Shanghai, located on the front line of the anti-Japanese war, was in a period of low pressure even without the plum rain. The low atmospheric pressure is just a handy means for the playwright to create atmosphere. A far heavier low pressure, like the overcast and rainy weather, has been shrouded in the drama, proceeding along with the drama. A social evil's low pressure. And even more important is the political low pressure. The continuous rain increases boredom. It is color, but it is not the essence.
    I hope the director can emphasize this point. The playwright's consistent patriotism should be made clear on the basis of life.
    These poor people do have the weaknesses, and even the inferior traits, of the petty bourgeoisie in the semi-colonial metropolis, and the playwright has written about them all. But they are not completely without merit. Their suffering is inseparable from the contradictions in life. Not to mention the more important characters, just look at "Li Lingbei," the old newspaper vendor, to know that his alcoholism is directly related to the January 28th Incident. It is not that his son died in the January 28th Incident that broke his heart, but that he died in vain that broke his heart. Look at how Huang Jiamei, the clerk in a foreign firm, lost his job? Because he was stubborn and refused to serve the faces of compradors and foreign bosses. A stubborn person in this semi-colonial metropolis is either unemployed or, after being unemployed, suffers from hunger and cold. Who can say that the elderly and deaf Huang father is not stubborn? Who can say that Shi Xiaobao, this woman of unknown origin on the Shanghai beach, is not stubborn? They are all playing tragedies. And Yang Caiyu, this "virtuous" housewife, blames her ex-husband in the play for being "a weakling," forgetting that she is even more of a weakling. But, friend, is she willing to be the weakling she despises? It's not good to blame her completely. She leaves us with complex feelings. Alas! This is the hateful old society.
    Can we not associate this with the political crimes of the comprador class? Kuang Fu meets us, this disheveled ex-husband, who has been in prison for ten years, on the day he returns to the world.
    Even a revolutionary fighter as unyielding as him feels depressed in the play when facing the ugly life. Older people, weathered by life's storms, are most prone to shrinking back. But the playwright does not allow his play to fall into a low key. The times are not like that either. Not long after, the all-out war of resistance broke out! And the arduous cause of the war of resistance ended in victory. The playwright's keen eye saw the future. He is optimistic. Don't let his gray titles like "City of Sorrow" and "Under the Shanghai Eaves" fool us. They are just titles. They are not equal to the theme. The appearance of the "Little Teacher" shows that "the uncheerful sun" can break through the clouds at any time and shine on the world. The children's singing awakens the temporarily dusty mood of middle-aged people. Kuang Fu throws off the feeling of vicissitudes and returns to the revolutionary road. Private disputes are not important. Individual struggles are also useless. The love tragedy between Lin Zhicheng, Yang Caiyu, and Kuang Fu, even Lin Zhicheng himself, understands that it was created by the reactionary government and its pawns. He does not resent Kuang Fu's return. He regrets, he hates. It would be simple if he only hated himself. He would not place his high hopes on Kuang Fu at the end, saying: "He will also be very brave for us sufferers..." He has hope. At this time, Kuang Fu has become a possible symbol of salvation for this group of petty bourgeoisie sufferers. When the curtain falls, it is not only the children who are singing, but even the adults are singing together: "Let's unite to save the country! Save the country!"
    So, watching this play, only today watching this play, its subtle places will become obvious. The play does not directly write about Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary government, but through concrete life, it writes about its crimes everywhere. The play does not directly write about the Chinese Communist Party calling for resistance to Japan, but through Kuang Fu's activities and even the existence of the Little Teacher, we understand who supports this existence. Not to mention that Kuang Fu is very likely to be a communist (because the playwright was not allowed to explain it clearly in the play at that time). So, despite the low pressure, the comic tone exists. The song finally replaces the cry.
    A good script is not necessarily well-acted. For actors, "Under the Shanghai Eaves" is a test. The play does not take place in one room. Not every room has a scene at the same time, but when there is no scene, it must not only have a scene, but also not hinder another room from acting. To maintain the subtext on stage requires extremely deep work on the character's personality and living environment.

    论“上海屋檐下”——与友人书
    李健吾
    来信谈到“上海屋檐下”。忽然之间，它在我眼前活了起来。“上海屋檐下”是夏衍的杰作之一。他写了好几出关于上海的好戏，几乎碰到所有的角落，对我特别意味隽永的，要以“上海屋檐下”为最。所以你说这出戏最近要由中国青年艺术剧院演出，我的喜悦之情立刻就洋溢心头了。
    这是一出个个角色有戏的群戏。它最能说明夏衍剧作的特征。这是一个值得后一代剧作者向它学习的一个戏。
    因为第一，他的素材一向紧紧扣合生活，难得看见他有夸张失实的败笔。而上海里弄生活是他最熟悉的生活。他写出了这半殖民地大都市的面貌。上海没有一个角落他不熟悉，小市民角落尤其熟悉。“上海屋檐下”刻画的正是这些立人檐下的小市民和沾染上了严重小市民气息的知识分子。
    因为第二，他使用素材，决不置身局外，罗列事实。他有用意。他在选择上下过很大的工夫。他的戏很简练，也最有明净的感觉。这种明净的感觉，不仅是手法高明的成就，也是思想坚定的收获。实际我们知道，思想往往决定手法的使用。
    乍看“上海屋檐下”，读者容易得到一个断而复续的画面的印象。原因就在这是一个弄堂房子的横断面，除去搁楼之外，除去亭子间（窗户朝我们开）之外，间间房屋摆在我们面前，间间房屋的故事摆在我们面前。于是故事在形式上有时候各别进行，有时候交插进行（小天井和后门所以显得热闹，事实上也是如此）。交错感觉容易产生断而复续的印象。
    很快这个印象就会不存在的。很快就会破开这些生活现象，出来一种揪心的力量，把我们吸在这些可怜人之所以为可怜的问题本身上。他们怎么会这样的？难道真是房屋的构造使他们不得不立在同一屋檐之下吗？
    不！绝对不！
    一位剧作者为了完成他给自己安排下来的主题任务，没有不可以利用的东西。夏衍就利用了上海里弄楼房的结构，更利用了上海黄梅时节的阴雨。连绵不断的阴雨“影响了这些住户们的心境”。
    但是“低气压”仅止于此吗？
    剧作者告诉我们，故事发生在1937年4月。有谁能忘记这一年吗？不久之后，就是七·七事变。再不久，就爆发了中国共产党号召抗战的惊天动地的英雄事件。而事变以前，位于抗战前沿的上海，却正处在没有黄梅雨也处在低气压的时期。天气的低气压只是剧作者制造气氛的一种得心应手的手段罢了。一种远为沉重的低气压像阴雨一样，一直笼罩着戏剧，和戏剧一同进行。一种社会罪恶的低气压。而更主要的则是政治的低气压。阴雨的连绵增加烦闷。它是色彩，却不就是基本。
    我希望导演能把这一点强调出来。应该在生活基础上，明朗剧作者一贯的爱国主义精神。
    这些可怜人的确全有半殖民地大都市小市民的软弱性、甚至于劣根性，剧作者也都写出来了。但是他们不就完全没有可取之处。他们的苦恼是和生活上那些矛盾分不开的。比较重要的人物不去说了，看看“李陵碑”这个老报贩，就知道他的嗜酒直接和一二·八之战有关联，不是他的儿子死在一二·八之战使他心碎，而是白白死掉使他心碎。看看黄家楣这个洋行职员是怎样失业的？由于他倔强，不肯伺候买办和外国老板的嘴脸。性格倔强的人，在这半殖民地大都市，不是失业，就是失业之后，饥寒交迫。谁能说年迈耳聋的黄父不倔强吗？谁能说施小宝这个身分不明的上海滩头女人不倔强吗？他们都在演悲剧。而杨彩玉这个“循良的”家庭主妇，在戏里责备前夫是“一个弱者”，忘却了自己更是一个弱者。但是，朋友，她甘心作她所不屑的弱者吗？怪她，也不好全怪她。她给我们留下复杂的感想。呜呼！这就是可恨的旧社会。
    能不联想到买办阶级的政治罪恶？匡复和我们见面，这个蓬头垢面的前夫，是坐了十年牢狱、再到人世的一天。
    连他这样不屈不挠的革命志士，在戏里面对着丑恶的生活，也起了颓丧的心情。年纪大的人们，饱经风霜，最易畏缩不前。但是剧作者不许他的戏沦入低调。时代也不是这样的。不多几时之后，就爆发了全面抗战！而抗战的艰巨事业是以胜利结束的。剧作者的明眼看到了未来。他是乐观的。不要让他的“愁城记”、“上海屋檐下”这类灰色标题把我们骗了。它们只是标题而已。它们并不等于主题。“小先生”的出现说明了“不爽朗的太阳”随时可以冲破云团，普照天下。孩子们的歌声唤醒中年人一时蒙尘的心境。匡复丢开沧桑之感，回到革命道路去了。私人纠纷不足重轻。个别挣扎也无济于事。林志成和杨彩玉和匡复的三人之间的恋爱悲剧，就连林志成自己，也明白是反动政府和它的爪牙作成的。他不怨匡复回来。他后悔，他痛恨。仅仅恨自己，问题倒也简单了。他也不会在最后把厚望寄托在匡复身上说：“他一定也会很勇敢地为着我们这些受难的人……”他有了希望。匡复这时，对这群受难的小市民来说，成了解救他们的可能的征象。幕落时，不光是孩子们在唱，而是连大人也一同在唱：“大家联合起来救国家！救国家！”
    所以看这出戏，只有今天看这出戏，它的若隐若现的地方，也就昭然若揭了。戏里没有正面写蒋介石反动政府，但是通过具体生活，处处写到了它的罪行。戏里没有正面写号召抗战的中国共产党，但是通过匡复的活动、乃至小先生的存在，我们明白是谁支持这种存在。还不说匡复大有可能是一个共产主义者（因为当时不允许剧作者在剧中交代明白）。所以尽管气压低，喜剧情调是存在着的。歌声终于替代了哭声。
    是好剧本，不就一定好演。对演员来说，“上海屋檐下”正是一种考验。戏不在一个房间发生。间间房间不是同时有戏，然而没有戏的时候，不但必须有戏，还要不妨害另一房间作戏。在台上维持潜台词，需要对人物的性格和生活环境下极深的工夫。
