    Reflections on a Haircut
    Bao Chang
    A few days ago, I went to a barbershop.

    My reason for getting a haircut isn't for cosmetic purposes. It's simply that when my hair gets too long, I get it trimmed so as not to frighten people. Therefore, I always choose a barbershop of average quality. Generally, I get a haircut every twenty-odd days, and from cutting to styling, it costs no more than forty or fifty cents.

    Who knew that this time, the price would suddenly increase? The original fifty cents went up to sixty, and the original sixty went up to ninety. Why the increase? It is said that the barbering industry is currently losing money, and raising prices can increase revenue and reverse the crowding in barbershops.

    There are many reasons for price increases of individual items. Sometimes it's because, with the free market just opened, market management is lax, and some vendors are pushing up prices. This requires a separate solution. But the barbershop price increase mentioned above was issued by a welfare company in the form of an order, which makes one feel strange.

    If the barbering industry is losing money, why was it able to sustain itself for so long in the past, but now it can't, even with crowded customers? After investigation, the barbering industry was originally profitable. The losses are because, after the public-private partnership, the management organization became too large. The number of employees engaged in the barbering industry in Tianjin was originally only about 4,500. Once the public-private partnership was established, a barbering management office, six district general stores, and thirty-three manager districts were established, with more than 250 full-time cadres, including 123 transferred from the original enterprises. This aspect of expenditure increased to more than 200,000 yuan, accounting for 15.6% of the total expenditure of the barbering industry. No wonder the cashiers are still struggling, despite the crowded customers.

    I don't understand why some people always like to erect a framework and make the organization extremely complex, completely disregarding whether it is necessary. For example, the situation of the three tea general stores in Tianjin is also the same. Once the public-private partnership was established, many cadres were transferred, euphemistically called "detailed division of labor." Some only engage in receiving and dispatching drafts, and some only manage house repairs. In addition, a full-time cadre is also assigned to supervise the implementation of management systems and employee benefits. Up and down, left and right, a gathering of talents. In fact, there are only a little over a hundred tea shops in Tianjin. Insiders say that only a dozen or so strong cadres are needed in the general store. I wonder if the cadres of this tea general store have had a haircut recently? If they knew that the price had increased when they got a haircut, and knew that the price increase was due to the expansion of non-productive organizations, maybe they would feel something!

    Sometimes people often do things that are self-contradictory. On the one hand, they clamor for "enterprise" and "professionalization," but on the other hand, they insist on expanding non-productive expenditures in their own enterprises, the more the better. When their hair gets long, they know they need to cut it; but when the organization becomes complex, they don't seem to feel any harm at all.

    理发有感
    鲍昌
    前几天进了一次理发馆。
    我之理发，没有什么美容的要求，不外乎头发一长，就修剪一番，使之不让人望而生畏就行了。因此选择的理发馆总是中常者流。一般是二十几天理一次发，从剪发到吹风，不过四、五角钱一次。
    谁想到这一次理发，忽然涨价了。原来五角的提到六角，原来六角的提到九角。为什么涨？据说目前理发业赔钱，提高定价可以增加收入，且可扭转理发店的拥挤现象云云。
    个别物品涨价，原因很多。有的是由于自由市场刚一开放，市场管理松弛，一些商贩就哄抬价格。这是需要另外想办法解决的。但像上面说的理发业涨价，却是由福利公司一道命令颁布下来的，这就使人感到跷蹊了。
    如果说理发业赔钱，为什么过去那么长的时间内，一直能维持下来，而现在顾客拥挤的情况下，反而维持不下去呢？经调查，理发业本来是赚钱的，赔钱是因为公私合营后，管理机构搞得过于庞大了。天津市从事理发业的职工原只有四千五百人左右，一公私合营，就设立了一个理发管理处，六个区总店，三十三个经理区，脱产干部二百五十余人，其中从原企业中抽调了一百二十三人。这方面的开支加大到二十多万元，占了理发业全部开支的15.6％，无怪乎顾客尽管拥挤，柜房仍然拮据了。
    我不明白，为什么有些人总爱支个架子，把机构搞得庞杂无比，全不顾是否合乎需要。再比如天津市的三个茶叶总店，情况也是如此。一公私合营，便抽调了许多干部，美其名曰“分工细致”，有的只搞收发拟稿，有的只管房屋修缮，此外，督促执行管理制度和职工福利的，也设一专职干部。上下左右，济济一堂。其实天津全市的茶叶店只有一百零几户，内行人说：总店里只要十几个较强的干部就行了。不知道这个茶叶总店的干部们最近理发了没有？如果理发时晓得涨价了，并且知道涨价是由于扩大非生产机构而来的，也许会有所感吧！
    有时人常常要办些自我矛盾的事。一方面，嚷叫着“企业化”“专业化”，另一方面，偏要在自己企业中扩大非生产开支，越多越好。头发长了，他们知道要剪；把机构庞杂了，他们却好像一点不觉得有什么坏处。
