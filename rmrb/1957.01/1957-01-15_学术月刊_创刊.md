    "Academic Monthly" Launched
    (Our dispatch) Shanghai's philosophy, social science, and literature circles, encouraged by the Party's "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, have prepared a comprehensive academic journal – "Academic Monthly" – which was launched in Shanghai on January 10.
    Judging from the inaugural issue of the journal, the variety of articles is relatively diverse. This issue published several articles on issues currently being discussed in academic circles. For example, in Shen Zhiyuan's "My Views on the Nature of the Contradiction Between the Working Class and the Bourgeoisie at the Current Stage," he argues that the contradiction between the Chinese bourgeoisie and the working class has always had both antagonistic and non-antagonistic natures. Antagonism is the main and fundamental aspect, and "antagonism itself cannot be transformed into non-antagonism." Only after the overall joint state-private ownership of enterprises was the antagonistic contradiction fundamentally eliminated. "Now, only non-antagonistic contradictions remain." Regarding research in dialectical materialism, the journal published Feng Qi's "On the Singular, the Particular, and the General," in which the author expounds on the dialectical relationship between these three categories. The inaugural issue also published articles with original insights in scientific research. For example, in Li Yanong's "Explanation of 'Da Sou'," based on historical materials, he put forward his own views on the meaning of the terms "Sou" and "Da Sou" in ancient texts. He believes that "Sou" and "Da Sou" in ancient times not only referred to hunting but, more importantly, referred to military training, military exercises, and even combat. In addition, the journal has relatively novel columns, such as "Informal Discussions," "Research Materials," "Problem Discussions," "Reviews of Academic Works," and "Academic Trends."
    The publication of this journal will add a forum for debate for the academic circles in Shanghai and East China, and it will have a certain encouraging effect on local creative academic research activities.

    “学术月刊”创刊
    本报讯　上海市的哲学、社会科学和文学界人士，在党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针的鼓舞下筹办的综合性学术刊物——“学术月刊”，已于1月10日在上海创刊。
    从该刊的创刊号看，文章的品种是比较多样的。在这一期刊物上发表了几篇关于当前学术界尚在讨论的问题的文章。如沈志远在他的“我对于现阶段工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾性质问题的看法”中认为：我国资产阶级同工人阶级的矛盾历来都存在对抗的和非对抗的两种性质。对抗是主要的根本的，“对抗性本身是不能转化为非对抗性的”。全行业合营后，对抗性矛盾才基本上消灭了。“现在剩下来的只是非对抗性的矛盾了”。关于辩证唯物主义的研究方面，该刊发表了冯契的“论单一、特殊、一般”，作者阐述了这三个范畴之间的辩证关系。创刊号中还发表了在科学研究中有一得之见的文章。如李亚农在他的“‘大搜’解”中，根据史料，对古文中的“搜”、“大搜”一词的含义提出了自己的看法。他认为“搜”、“大搜”在古代不仅指打猎，更主要的是指练兵、军事演习甚至作战。此外，该刊还有比较新颖的栏目，如“丛谈”、“研究资料”、“问题讨论”、“学术论著评介”和“学术动态”等。
    这个刊物的出版，为上海和华东地区的学术界增加了一块争鸣的园地，对于当地创造性的学术研究活动将有一定的鼓励作用。
