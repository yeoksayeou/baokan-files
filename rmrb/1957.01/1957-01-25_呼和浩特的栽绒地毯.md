    Hohhot's Pile Carpets
    Wang Wen
    People who arrive in Hohhot for the first time know that it has specialties like sheepskin coats and Mongolian boots, but few know that it also has a famous specialty – pile carpets.
    The pile carpets produced in Hohhot are strong and moisture-proof. A carpet can be laid for more than a hundred years without wearing out. They are suitable for use in Mongolian yurts, as well as in magnificent halls. Moreover, the artisans can weave beautiful and moving patterns on the carpets, such as Dragon and Tiger Fight, Four Seasons Flowers, Five Ethical Relationships, Six Harmonies Returning to Spring, Eight骏马 (Eight Steeds), Lions Playing with Embroidered Balls, Phoenix Playing with Peonies, Prairie Scenery, the Great Wall at Badaling, Bai Lixi Herding Horses... These pile carpets have always been very popular in the grasslands, cities, and foreign markets.
    Hohhot has historically been the center for the collection and distribution of animal skins and furs from the Inner Mongolian grasslands, and the pile carpet craft developed in this ancient border city very early on. According to old artisans, the carpet craft flourished even more here by the end of the Qing Dynasty. By the beginning of the Republic of China, the number of workshops making pile carpets in the city gradually increased, and there were once as many as two to three hundred artisans weaving carpets.
    After the start of the Anti-Japanese War, Hohhot was occupied by Japanese imperialism, and the wool weaving craft was severely damaged. Carpet-making workshops closed down one after another. Some artisans fled to other places to participate in agricultural production, while others became peddlers.
    After liberation, the People's Government attached great importance to the production of pile carpets. In 1953, the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government collected a "Five Dragons Pattern" carpet produced in Hohhot in the past to participate in the National Folk Art and Craft Exhibition held in Beijing; the artisans elected the old artisan Shao Deyi to attend this exhibition. After the meeting, Shao Deyi also received a living allowance. However, this matter did not attract the attention of the local relevant departments, and this folk craft was on the verge of being lost in Hohhot.
    It was not until after the upsurge of socialist transformation came that pile carpets received the attention of the relevant departments and production was restored. However, only sixteen artisans were found, and the youngest of them was over thirty years old. These sixteen artisans joined the Hohhot Wool Textile Production Cooperative. They accepted the production task of 1,000 square feet of pile carpets for the first time and received the cooperative's mobile red flag.
    However, they have not yet taken in a single apprentice, and there are also difficulties in the supply of raw materials and the lives of the artisans. It is hoped that these issues will attract the attention of the local relevant departments and provide assistance.

    呼和浩特的栽绒地毯
    王温
    初到呼和浩特的人都知道这里有羊皮袄、蒙古靴等特产，却很少有人知道这里还有一种著名的特产——栽绒地毯。
    呼和浩特出产的栽绒地毯结实、隔潮，一块地毯铺一百多年也磨不烂，既适合在蒙古包里铺用，也适合在富丽堂皇的庭堂里铺用。而且艺人们能在地毯上织出龙虎斗、四季花、五伦图、六合回春、八骏马、狮子滚绣球、凤凰戏牡丹、草原风光、八达岭、百里奚牧马……许多美丽、动人的图案。这种栽绒毯一向很受草原、城市和国外市场的欢迎。
    呼和浩特历来是内蒙古草原皮毛集散的中心，栽绒地毯工艺很早以前就在这座边疆古城里发达起来。据老艺人谈，到清代末年地毯工艺在这里就更加繁盛了。到民国初年，市内制作栽绒地毯的作坊日益增多，织毛毯的艺人曾经多到二三百人。
    抗日战争开始后，呼和浩特在日本帝国主义占领之下，毛织工艺受到了严重摧残，制毛毯的作坊纷纷歇业。艺人们有的流往他乡参加了农业生产，有的做了小贩。
    解放后，人民政府很重视栽绒地毯的生产。1953年中央文化部在北京举行的全国民间美术工艺品展览会，搜集了呼和浩特过去出产的“五龙图案”地毯参加了展览；艺人们推选老艺人邵德义出席了这次展览会。会后，邵德义还得到了一笔生活补助费。可是这件事没有引起当地有关部门的注意，这种民间工艺品眼看就要在呼和浩特失传了。
    一直到社会主义改造高潮来到后，栽绒地毯才受到有关部门的注意，恢复了生产。但找到的艺人只有十六个，他们的年龄最小的也三十多岁了。这十六个艺人参加了呼和浩特市毛纺生产合作社。第一次接受了一千平方市尺栽绒地毯的生产任务，并得到社里的流动红旗。
    可是，他们目前一个徒工都还没有吸收，原料供应和艺人生活上也有困难。这些，都希望能引起当地有关部门注意予给帮助。
