    To My Friends in Beijing
    Lu Ning
    After more than nine days and a long journey of nearly five thousand kilometers, I came to Beijing from the southwestern frontier of our motherland—Yunnan. As far as I know, no one living in remote provinces does not consider it a happy thing to be able to come to Beijing. How we look forward to seeing Tiananmen Square with our own eyes, and to seeing Longxugou; and how we hope to bring some new knowledge and the deep friendship of the people of Beijing back to our relatives and friends. Every night, when I stand in front of the window of the high-rise hotel, facing the myriad lights of Beijing, I always think with gratitude: these lights also illuminate our Kunming and Mangshi, and our thousands of miles of borders in Yunnan, because we always follow Beijing's lead, always follow in the footsteps of the people of the capital!
    Precisely because we have great expectations of you, we also hope that you can understand us more. However, here, I want to say that many comrades working in Beijing do not have enough understanding of us, nor deep enough. After I came to Beijing, some people came to see me with strange feelings, wondering why I was not too different from Beijingers in appearance, dress, and language; in some people's minds, Yunnan people are probably still a bit strange. Some of the reports about Yunnan in the newspapers do not seem to truly write about the hearts of the people there and their hard work. When Kunming is mentioned, it seems that there is nothing else besides "spring all year round." You don't really understand the frontier. Don't imagine it as paradise, and don't think it's still some kind of "uncivilized land." Understand us more, comrades in Beijing, please come and see it if you have the opportunity.
    Of course, in recent years, many Beijingers have visited, traveled, and worked in our place, giving us a lot of help. But I also have some opinions about certain people: they go there with a certain sense of superiority. They pick up some things with a curious attitude, then dust themselves off and leave with big and small packages. For example, individual art groups or artists go to our place just to collect some materials to report back to Beijing. And after they leave, they don't pay any attention to us anymore. Here, please allow me to offer a crude opinion: the Yunnan flower lantern "Ten Sisters" and the dance "Tibetan Cavalry," which have been performed internationally, once took the hard work of some comrades working in the arts in Yunnan. They collected, sorted, and rehearsed, and the latter was even created. However, after the comrades in Beijing "processed" these programs, they abandoned the people and art groups who had really contributed, and didn't even ask how much Yunnan flavor the "Ten Sisters" in Beijing still had, even though it was labeled as "Yunnan Flower Lantern"!
    The above can be said to be my opinions to my friends in Beijing, the purpose of which is only to hope that the comrades in Beijing will understand us more and help us more. It is not easy for us to come to Beijing once, especially it is difficult to have the opportunity to talk about the opinions of friends in Beijing (these opinions are not necessarily just my own), so I wrote this short article, although our demands on the comrades working in Beijing may be a bit harsh.

    给北京的朋友们
    鲁凝
    经过九天多的时间，近五千公里的长途跋涉，我从祖国的西南边疆——云南来到了北京。据我所知，居住在边远省份的人们，没有哪个不把能到北京当成一件幸福的事。我们多么盼望亲自望一望天安门，看一看龙须沟；而我们多么希望能把一些新的知识和北京人民的深厚友谊给亲友们带回去。每晚，当我立在旅馆高楼的窗前，对着北京的万家灯火，我总会怀着感激的心情这样想着：这些灯火也照耀着我们的昆明、芒市，我们云南的几千里边界，因为我们总是跟着北京前进，总是跟着首都人民的步伐前进啊！
    正因为我们对你们抱着很大的希望，也就希望你们能更多地了解我们。可是，在这里，我想说在北京工作的很多同志，你们对我们了解是不够多，不够深的。我来到北京后，就曾经有人怀着奇怪的心情来看我，奇怪我为什么在外形上、装束上、语言上和北京人并没有太大的区别；在有些人的心里，云南人大概总还是有点奇形怪状的。报纸上刊载的关于云南的一些报道，似乎也还没有真正写出那儿的人民的心灵和他们辛勤的劳动。提起昆明，好像除了“四季如春”就再没别的了。你们没有真正地了解边疆。不能把那儿想像成天堂，也不要以为那儿还是什么“蛮荒之地”。更多地了解我们吧，北京的同志们，有机会就请去看看吧。
    当然，几年来，也有不少北京人到我们那儿去参观、旅行和工作过，给了我们不少帮助。不过对于某些人，我也还有点意见：他们是带着某种程度的优越感去的。他们以猎奇的态度拾掇起一些东西后，就拍拍屁股大包小包地背着走了。比如个别的艺术团体或艺术家，到我们那儿，就只是为了搜集些东西到北京汇报。而走了以后就再也不理我们了。在这里，请容许我提个粗鲁的意见：带到国际上去演出过的云南花灯“十大姐”和舞蹈“藏族骑兵队”，曾经花过一些在云南做艺术工作的同志们的心血。他们搜集、整理、排练，后者还是创作出来的。可是，在北京的同志把这些节目“加工”之后，就把原来真正出过力的人和艺术团体丢开了，甚至也没有问问北京的“十大姐”到底还有多少云南味，虽然标名为“云南花灯”！
    以上，可以说是我对北京的朋友们提出的意见，目的只不过是希望北京的同志们多了解我们一些，多帮助我们一些。我们不容易来一次北京，尤其很难有机会说说对北京朋友的意见（这些意见也不一定只是我个人的），因此就写了这篇短文，虽然我们对在北京工作的同志的要求可能苛刻了些。
