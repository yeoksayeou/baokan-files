Xinhua News Agency, January 27th, San Francisco dispatch: US Federal Judge Goodman rejected the request of Powell's defense lawyer, Willing, on the 25th. Willing requested the federal court to order the US State Department to issue him a passport to China.

Willing made this request in order to collect evidence in China regarding the US conducting bacteriological warfare, so as to defend the Powell couple who are being persecuted by the US government. The Powell couple are being accused of so-called "sedition" by the US government because they reported in the former "China Monthly Review" that the US conducted bacteriological warfare during the Korean War.

    美国阻挠鲍惠尔的辩护律师来中国
    新华社27日讯　旧金山消息：美国联邦法官古德曼25日拒绝了鲍惠尔的辩护律师威林的要求，他要求联邦法院命令美国国务院把前往中国的护照发给他。
    威林提出这个要求是为了到中国搜集有关美国进行细菌战的证据，以便为正在受到美国政府迫害的鲍惠尔夫妇进行辩护。鲍惠尔夫妇由于在前“密勒氏评论报”上报道了朝鲜战争期间美国进行了细菌战的情况，而被美国政府指控为犯有所谓“煽动叛乱罪”。
