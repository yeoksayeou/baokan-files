Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 30th - The first session of the Second Tianjin Municipal People's Congress closed on the 29th. The central task of Tianjin Municipality for 1957, as decided by the meeting, is to comprehensively and thoroughly launch the campaign to increase production and practice economy. It requires the total output value of local industry to increase by another 10.88% on top of the 31% increase this year, while reducing costs by 3%-5%. Other aspects of economic construction should also have corresponding growth.

At this meeting, the delegates raised more than 1,000 suggestions on the government's work. The delegates believed that the government's achievements were significant, but there were still serious bureaucratic phenomena in many areas of work. For example, some administrative institutions were large and bloated. In the seventeen bureaus of the Municipal People's Committee, personnel, general affairs, clerical, and logistical staff accounted for about 40% of the total number of people in these bureaus. The large administrative institutions have resulted in some organs having so-called "principled" leading cadres who are detached from practical affairs, making bureaucracy prevail and work procedures complicated and cumbersome. In order to change this situation, the meeting decided to streamline management personnel and non-production personnel to supplement production personnel, business personnel, and personnel engaged in practical work. At the same time, the meeting called for further implementation of democratic management of enterprises and the establishment of enterprise management committees with the participation of worker representatives in factories.

At the meeting, the delegates also discussed the issues of intellectuals, cooperative relations in joint state-private enterprises, as well as children's education, social atmosphere, and market supply, and raised criticisms and suggestions. University professor Li Helin said: "What we get most now is various preferential treatments, care, and respect, but we rarely get ideological help." Middle school principal Shen Huiru criticized some administrative leaders for focusing on the person rather than the matter when listening to the opinions of the masses, dismissing opinions based on the person who voiced them, and blocking the channels for expressing opinions. Chen Tongdu, a director of the Tianjin branch of the China Association for Promoting Democracy and a professor at Tianjin Normal College, requested that the party and government leaders in his unit provide positive education and direct assistance, and that cadres engaged in personnel work should not be afraid or unwilling to approach senior intellectuals because they are inferior to them in culture and business. How capitalists can improve their relationship with workers in joint state-private enterprises is a concern for the representatives of industrialists and businessmen. Bi Mingqi, the largest capitalist in Tianjin, said that the long-term exploitation of workers by capitalists and the resulting resentment are difficult to reverse all at once after the joint state-private ownership. We should work actively and appropriately make self-criticisms to the workers, striving to change the workers' perceptions of us.

The meeting reviewed the work of the Tianjin Municipal Higher People's Court and made resolutions on the 1,751 proposals submitted by the delegates and citizens.

The meeting elected the Mayor, Vice Mayors, and members of the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 30th - Heilongjiang Province held its Fifth Session of the First People's Congress from December 24th to 29th. This meeting made a resolution to extensively and thoroughly launch the campaign to increase production and practice economy throughout the province, based on the principles of "consolidating achievements, improving quality, focusing on development, and making overall arrangements."

In agriculture, the meeting called for relying on the labor enthusiasm of cooperative members on the basis of cooperativization to vigorously carry out the production increase campaign centered on improving cultivation techniques and increasing yield per unit area; vigorously developing animal husbandry; actively and systematically developing diversified operations; and planting various cash crops in appropriate proportions to comprehensively develop agricultural production. To this end, it is planned to increase the total grain output in 1957 by about 500,000 tons compared with 1956; the sown area will be 7.4 million hectares, an increase of 320,000 hectares compared with 1956; the number of livestock such as cattle, horses, and pigs in the province will increase by 400,000 head compared with 1956; and the total income from sideline production in the province is required to account for about 40% of the agricultural income in 1957.

In local industry, the meeting called for fully utilizing provincial resources in 1957 to vigorously exploit production and technical potential in order to further improve product quality, reduce costs, increase variety, and increase output.

The meeting called on all regions and departments to conscientiously summarize the past experiences and lessons of increasing production and practicing economy, proceed from actual conditions, quickly and specifically formulate plans for increasing production and practicing economy in 1957, and take effective measures to continue carrying out the socialist competition centered on increasing production and practicing economy.

The meeting elected Zhao Qufei, Chen Jianfei, and Wang Chunzheng as Vice Governors of Heilongjiang Province.

    迎接新的一年深入开展增产节约运动
    天津市和黑龙江省召开人民代表大会会议作出决定
    新华社天津30日电　天津市第二届人民代表大会第一次会议在29日闭幕。会议决定的天津市1957年中心任务是：全面深入地开展增产节约运动，要求地方工业总产值在今年增长31％的基础上再增长10.88％，同时降低成本3％—5％。经济建设事业的其他方面也要有相应的增长。
    在这次会议上，代表们对政府工作提出了一千多条意见。代表们认为，政府工作的成绩是巨大的，但是许多工作中还存在着严重的官僚主义现象。例如有些办事机构庞大臃肿，市人民委员会十七个局的人事、总务、文书、勤杂等服务性的人员就占到这些局总人数的40％左右。办事机构庞大，使有些机关出现不少脱离实际事务的所谓“原则”领导干部，使文牍主义盛行，工作手续复杂繁琐。为了改变这种情况，会议决定精简管理人员和非生产人员，以充实生产人员、业务人员和作实际工作的人员。同时，会议要求进一步实行企业的民主管理，在工厂里成立有工人代表参加的企业管理委员会。
    会上，代表们还就知识分子问题、公私合营企业中合作共事关系问题以及儿童教育、社会风气、市场供应等问题展开了讨论，并且提出了批评和建议。大学教授李河林说：“我们现在得到最多的是各种优待、照顾和尊重，但是很少得到思想上的帮助。”中学校长沈慧儒批评有些行政领导干部在听取群众意见时对人不对事，因人废言，堵塞了言路。中国民主促进会天津分会理事、天津师范学院教授陈同度要求他所在单位的党政领导人员给予正面的教育和直接的帮助，要求做人事工作的干部不要因为自己在文化业务上不如高级知识分子就不敢或不愿意同他们接近。在公私合营企业里资本家如何搞好和工人的关系，是工商业者代表们所关心的问题。天津最大的资本家毕鸣岐说，资本家长期剥削职工和由此所遗留下来的恶感，很难设想在公私合营以后就一下子扭转过来。我们应该以积极的工作，并且适当地向职工们作自我批评，争取把职工对我们的观感改变过来。
    会议审查了天津市高级人民法院的工作，同时对代表和市民们提出的一千七百五十一件提案作出了处理的决议。
    这次会议选举了天津市市长、副市长和市人民委员会的委员。
    新华社哈尔滨30日电　黑龙江省在12月24日到29日举行了第一届人民代表大会第五次会议。这次会议作出决议，要根据“巩固成绩、提高质量、重点发展、全面安排”的方针，在全省广泛深入地开展增产节约运动。
    在农业方面，会议要求在合作化的基础上，依靠社员群众的劳动积极性，努力开展以提高耕作技术、提高单位面积产量为中心的增产运动；大力发展畜牧事业；积极地有计划有步骤地发展多种经营，并按照适当比例种植各种经济作物，全面发展农业生产。为此，计划在1957年粮食总产量比1956年增加五十万吨左右；播种面积七百四十万公顷，比1956年增加三十二万公顷；全省牛、马、猪等牲畜比1956年增加四十万头；全省副业生产总收入要求占1957年农产收入的40％左右。
    在地方工业方面，会议要求在1957年内充分利用省内资源，大力发挥生产和技术潜力，以进一步提高产品质量、降低成本、增加花色品种、增加产量。
    会议要求各地区和各部门认真地总结过去增产节约的经验教训，从实际情况出发，迅速地具体制定1957年增产节约的计划，采取有效措施，继续开展以增产节约为中心的社会主义竞赛。
    会议增选了赵去非、陈剑飞、王春正三人为黑龙江省副省长。
