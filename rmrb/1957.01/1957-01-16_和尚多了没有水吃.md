Too Many Cooks Spoil the Broth

According to instructions from higher authorities, Taixian County, Jiangsu Province, has successively established so-called "three stations" and "three groups" with similar work natures in general districts—Agricultural Technology Extension Station, Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Station, Seed Station, Accounting Guidance Group, Agricultural Technology Extension Group of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and the soon-to-be-established Sericulture Group.

The District Agricultural Technology Extension Station is a comprehensive agricultural unit, whose main tasks are to promote agricultural science and technology and advanced production experience, do a good job in crop cultivation, livestock breeding and veterinary work, and strengthen agricultural accounting guidance. Therefore, the cadres of the Agricultural Technology Extension Station are also relatively well-equipped. In the past, under unified leadership, the work was carried out in an orderly manner. Since the establishment of these three stations and three groups, due to the same work nature of these stations and groups, there is a mutual dependency between them. For example, when Jiangduo District was promoting drug seed mixing for wheat seeds, the Extension Station believed that this was the responsibility of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Extension Group and did not need to interfere; the Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Extension Group felt that this was the responsibility of the Extension Station and did not interfere either. As a result, the promotion task was not completed well, resulting in a backlog of drugs and affecting wheat disease prevention and control.

Since so many work stations and work groups have been established in a district, they naturally have their work to do. When autumn planting began last year, Xia Guangxian, the township head of Xuzhu Township in Jiangduo District, received four urgent notices from the district concerning agricultural production work within two days: the Extension Station required improving the quality of autumn sowing to ensure a bumper summer harvest in 1957; the Supply and Marketing Cooperative Extension Group required completing the sales of pesticides; the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Station required the rational use and allocation of cattle power and hog epidemic prevention injections; and the Seed Station required the rapid promotion of improved wheat varieties. The content of these four notices was roughly the same, and all of them were mentioned in the document issued by the Extension Station.

Why has the original comprehensive District Agricultural Technology Extension Station become the current "three stations" and "three groups"? It is mainly due to the continuous increase of upper-level institutions. Originally, Taixian County only had one agricultural section, but now it is divided into agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry sections. As the upper-level institutions have expanded, some stations and groups below have also arisen accordingly.

If the cadres allocated to these added institutions are used to enrich and strengthen the comprehensive Agricultural Technology Extension Station and unify leadership, it can not only change the phenomenon of overlapping agricultural institutions and overstaffing, but also be more beneficial to the development of work. As one veterinary technician who originally worked at the Extension Station said: "Originally, there was only one extension station in each district, and the work was not only done in the same way, but also in an organized manner; now there are more stations and groups, but instead, too many cooks spoil the broth."

### “和尚多了没有水吃”

    “和尚多了没有水吃”
    江苏省泰县根据上级指示，在一般区相继建立工作性质差不多的所谓“三站”“三组”——农业技术推广站、畜牧兽医站、种子站、会计辅导组、供销合作社的农业技术推广组和即将建立的蚕桑组。
    区农业技术推广站是综合性的农事业单位，主要任务是推广农业科学技术和先进生产经验，搞好农作物栽培，做好家畜饲养和兽医工作，加强农业社会计辅导等工作。因此，农业技术推广站的干部配备得也比较齐全。过去，在统一领导下，工作有条不紊。自从成立了这三站、三组以后，由于这些站、组的工作性质相同，相互之间都存在着依赖思想。如蒋垛区在推广药剂拌麦种的时候，推广站认为这是供销社推广组的事，不必加以过问；供销社推广组呢，感到这是推广站的事，也没过问这件事。结果，推广任务完成得不好，形成药剂积压，还影响了麦类病害防治工作。
    一个区里既然设立了这么多工作站和工作组，自然也有他们的工作可做。去年开始秋种的时候，蒋垛区许朱乡乡长夏广贤在两天内就接到区里下达的有关农业生产工作的紧急通知四份：推广站要求提高秋播质量，保证1957年夏季丰收；供销社推广组要求完成农药推销任务；畜牧兽医站要求合理使用调配牛力和生猪防疫注射；种子站要求迅速做好小麦良种推广任务。这四份通知的内容大致相同，在推广站发出的那个文件里已经都谈到了。
    为什么会从原来的一个综合性的区农业技术推广站变成了现在的“三站”“三组”呢？主要是由上层机构不断加多而来的。原来泰县只有一个农业科，现在分成农、林、牧三个科，上层机构扩大了，下面的一些站和组也相应而生。
    如果把这些增添机构所配备的干部，用来充实加强综合性的农业技术推广站，统一领导，不但可以改变农事业机构重叠、人浮于事的现象，同时对工作开展会更加有利。正如原来在推广站工作的一个兽医技术干部说的：“原来每区只有一个推广站，工作不但同样干，而且干得有头绪；现在站、组多了，反而弄得三个和尚没水吃。”
