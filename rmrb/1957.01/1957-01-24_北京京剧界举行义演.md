Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch: The Beijing Peking Opera circles have resumed the traditional practice of holding charity performances for mutual aid before the Spring Festival. From the 21st to the 23rd, more than 400 actors and stage staff held a grand charity performance at the Guanghe Theater for three consecutive days to help impoverished artists in the profession. Veteran Peking Opera actors Xiao Changhua and contemporary famous actors Shang Xiaoyun, Ma Lianliang, and Ye Sheng Lan all participated in the performance.
    Such charity performances were formerly called "Wowo Tou Society" and have been passed down in Beijing's Liyuan (opera) circles for decades, but were interrupted after the "July 7th" Incident.

    北京京剧界举行义演
    据新华社23日讯　北京京剧界又恢复了每逢春节前举行义演互济的传统习惯。从21日至23日，有四百多演员和舞台工作人员在广和剧场连续举行了三天盛大的义演，救济同业中的贫苦艺人。京剧界前辈演员萧长华和当代名演员尚小云、马连良、叶盛兰都参加了演出。
    这样的义演早年叫“窝窝头会”，在北京梨园界相传几十年，在“七·七”事变以后中断了。
