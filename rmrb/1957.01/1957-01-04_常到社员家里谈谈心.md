Often Chat with Commune Members at Their Homes
In the Yumo District of Jinsha County, Guizhou Province, some commune members requested to withdraw from the cooperative. Some leaders of the cooperatives did not understand the reasons, but labeled these commune members as "troublemakers," "spontaneous," and "backward," and took various measures to restrict their withdrawal. After studying this issue, the staff of the Jinsha County Yumo District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party led the cooperative leaders to visit the homes of the commune members. Only then did they learn that some commune members wanted to withdraw from the cooperative because they were dissatisfied with the corruption in the cooperative; others wanted to withdraw because their legitimate demands were not met. In short, these people did not really want to abandon the path of collectivization. After the comrades of the District Committee helped the cooperative solve the problems that the commune members were concerned about, those commune members who wanted to withdraw no longer wanted to do so. This incident educated the cooperative leaders. They realized that subjectively presuming and arbitrarily labeling people could only make things worse.
Visiting commune members' homes and chatting with them is not only helpful in correctly resolving issues such as withdrawal from the cooperative; in resolving any issue that the commune members are concerned about, doing so will be of great benefit.

    常到社员家里谈谈心
    贵州省金沙县禹谟区有一些社员要求退社，有些合作社的领导人员不去了解是什么原因，就给这些社员扣上“挑皮”“自发”“落后”的帽子，并且采取种种办法限制他们退社。中共金沙县禹谟区委员会的工作人员研究了这个问题以后，就领导合作社的领导人员到社员家庭去访问。这才了解到，有些社员要退社，是因为对于社里有贪污现象不满；另一些要退社的社员，也是因为对他们的正当的要求得不到答复而不满。总之，这些人并不是真的不愿意走合作化的道路。区委会的同志帮助合作社解决了社员们所关心的问题以后，那些要求退社的社员就不想退社了。这件事教育了合作社的领导人员。他们认识到凭主观上的臆断乱扣帽子，只能把事情办得更糟。
    到社员家里去串串门，谈谈心，不单有助于正确地解决退社这样的问题；在解决任何为社员们所关心的问题的时候，这样做，都会有很大好处。
