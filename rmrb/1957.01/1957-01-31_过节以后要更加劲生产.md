On the eve of the Spring Festival, the vast majority of members of the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Liquan County, Shaanxi Province, were happily busy preparing for the New Year and sewing new clothes; however, a few members were still worried that they would not be able to celebrate the New Year. This was not because these people's income had decreased, but because of various objective reasons. For example, some had suffered from illness or bereavement, and others had blindly improved their lives in the past, spending too much.

Just as these people were worried, the cooperative helped them solve their difficulties. Those who should be taken care of were given care, those who needed to borrow money were lent money, and those who did not have wheat to get through the New Year were also given assistance. Cooperative member Wang Zhenji's mother, Liu Zhenxian, said with emotion: "The agricultural cooperative not only cured my son's illness, but also helped my family celebrate the Spring Festival. We will never forget this kindness for generations to come."

Now, these households in difficulty are, like other cooperative members, going to the market to buy what they need. They have all stated that after the Spring Festival, they will work hard to produce and strive for a greater harvest.

    过节以后要更加劲生产
    春节前夕，陕西醴泉县烽火农业社的绝大多数社员都高兴地忙着办年货、缝新衣；可是仍有个别社员担心自己过不了年。这倒不是这些人的收入减少了，而是有着种种客观原因。比如，有的因为遭了病、丧事故，有的是以往盲目改善生活，花费过多。
    正当这些人发愁的时候，社里帮助他们解决了困难，应该照顾的给予照顾，要借钱的也借了，没有麦过年的也给调剂了。社员王振吉的母亲刘真贤感动地说：农业社不仅给我儿子治好了病，还帮助我家过春节，我们世世辈辈忘不了这恩情。
    现在，这些困难户都和其他社员一样，上年集买回自己需要的东西，他们一致表示：过了春节以后，要努力生产，争取更大丰收。
