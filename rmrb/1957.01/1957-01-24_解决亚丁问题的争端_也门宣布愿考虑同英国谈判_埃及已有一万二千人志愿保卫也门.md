Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd, London Dispatch: The Yemeni Embassy in London announced on the evening of the 22nd that Yemen is willing to consider negotiations with Britain to resolve the dispute over Aden.

The Yemeni Embassy stated that the Yemeni government "does not object to reconsidering a meeting of officials from both sides, if the purpose of the meeting is to achieve a ceasefire between free Yemen and occupied Yemen, and to use this as a preliminary step leading to negotiations to resolve the entire issue."

However, a communique issued by the British Foreign Office on the same evening indicated that Britain is unwilling to resolve the entire Aden issue through negotiations. The British communique stated that the purpose of the meeting is only to "restore peace on the border."

The communique also expressed non-recognition of the British-occupied "Aden Protectorate" as Yemeni territory. The communique said that if the term "occupied Yemen" refers to the "Aden Protectorate," Britain "cannot accept it under any circumstances."

Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd, Cairo Dispatch: The Yemeni Ambassador to Egypt, Abu Taleb, announced on the evening of the 22nd that 12,000 Egyptians have volunteered to help Yemen resist British aggression. He said that 8,000 of them had registered at the Yemeni Embassy in Cairo, and the rest had registered in Liberation Province.

He pointed out that Britain is still taking hostile actions against Yemen, and so far there is no news of a ceasefire.

He added that the King of Yemen, Imam Ahmad, had suggested in December of last year to establish a border commission to resolve outstanding issues, but "such an institution is now insufficient to deal with problems of this magnitude."

Abu Taleb said that so far, Britain has not responded to Yemen's proposal to hold a plebiscite in the region.

    解决亚丁问题的争端
    也门宣布愿考虑同英国谈判
    埃及已有一万二千人志愿保卫也门
    新华社23日讯　伦敦消息：也门驻伦敦公使馆在22日晚间宣布，也门愿意考虑同英国进行谈判，来解决在亚丁问题上的争端。
    也门公使馆说，也门政府“不反对重新考虑由双方官员举行会议，如果会议的目的在于实现自由的也门和被占领的也门之间的停火，并且以此作为导致解决整个问题的谈判的初步步骤的话”。
    但是，英国外交部在同一天晚间发表的公报表明，英国不愿意通过谈判解决整个亚丁问题上的争端。英国的公报说，举行会议的目的只是“恢复边境的和平状态”。
    公报还表示不承认英国侵占的“亚丁保护地”是也门的领土。公报说，如果认为“被占领的也门”这个词语是指“亚丁保护地”而言，英国是“无论如何不能接受的”。
    新华社23日讯　开罗消息：也门驻埃及公使阿布·塔列布在22日晚间宣布，已经有一万二千个埃及人志愿报名去帮助也门抵抗英国侵略。他说，其中有八千个人是在开罗的也门公使馆报名的，其余的人是在解放省报名的。
    他指出，英国仍在对也门采取敌对行动，到现在为止还没有关于停火的消息。
    他又说，也门国王伊马姆·艾哈迈德在去年12月曾经建议设立一个边界委员会来解决悬而未决的问题，可是“这样的机构在现在已经不足以处理目前这样规模的问题了”。
    阿布·塔列布说，到现在为止，英国还没有答复也门提出的在这个地区举行公民投票的建议。
