Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Respectable Prime Minister, Your Excellencies, Gentlemen,

First of all, please allow me, on behalf of myself, Vice Premier He Long, and all the personnel accompanying me, to express our heartfelt gratitude to the government of the Kingdom of Afghanistan and the Afghan people. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to visit your magnificent country, and thank you for your grand welcome and warm reception. I represent the Chinese government and the Chinese people in extending our sincere respect and cordial greetings to the Afghan government and the Afghan people.

As the Prime Minister said, Afghanistan and China have had close ties in trade and culture for many centuries. Although the Pamir Plateau separates our two countries, our ancestors crossed the treacherous mountains and opened up the historically famous "Silk Road," engaging in friendly exchanges. Indeed, in the relationship between our two countries, there has never been war or conflict, but only friendship and sympathy.

In the past hundred years, both of our countries have suffered from colonialist aggression and oppression. However, just as the Pamir Plateau could not isolate our two countries, the forces of colonialism could not hinder the friendship between our two peoples. The Chinese people greatly admire the Afghan people's heroic struggle against colonialism. The victory of the Afghan people's struggle for national independence has inspired the Chinese people who are fighting for their own national independence. After our two peoples shook off the shackles of colonialism, the friendly relations between our two countries have developed on a new foundation.

Like many Asian and African countries, Afghanistan and China love peace and justice. Together with many other Asian and African countries, our two countries made joint efforts at the Bandung Conference to promote mutual understanding and cooperation among Asian and African peoples, to oppose colonialism, and to safeguard world peace. The Chinese people greatly respect Afghanistan's policy of being friendly with all countries on the basis of mutual respect. The Chinese people greatly admire Afghanistan's just stand in supporting Egypt's resistance against aggression. The Chinese people are also particularly grateful for the support Afghanistan has given us in restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

The Chinese people have always advocated developing friendly relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and particularly value friendship and cooperation with neighboring countries. We are very pleased to see that the relations between China and Afghanistan have developed well on the basis of mutual respect. We firmly believe that the common desire of our two peoples to further develop friendly cooperation between our two countries not only conforms to the interests of our two peoples, but is also conducive to peace in Asia and the world.

I propose:

To the health of His Majesty King Mohammed Zahir Shah of Afghanistan,

To the health of His Excellency Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud Khan of the Kingdom of Afghanistan,

To the prosperity and happiness of the Afghan people,

To the ever-increasing friendship between China and Afghanistan,

To peace in Asia and the world,

Cheers!

专栏：

    周恩来总理的讲话尊敬的首相殿下，阁下们，先生们，
    首先，请允许我以我个人和贺龙副总理以及同我同行的全体人员的名义，向阿富汗王国政府和阿富汗人民表示衷心的感谢，感谢你们使我们能够有机会访问你们壮丽的国家，感谢你们的隆重欢迎和热情接待。我代表中国政府和中国人民向阿富汗政府和阿富汗人民表示诚挚的敬意和亲切的问候。
    正如首相殿下所说的，在过去的许多世纪里，阿富汗和中国就曾经有过贸易和文化的密切联系。我们两国之间虽然有着帕米尔高原的阻隔，但是我们的祖先却翻越过险峻的山岭，开辟了历史上著名的“丝路”，进行了友好的往来。的确，在我们两国的关系中，从来没有战争和冲突，而只有友谊和同情。
    近百年来，我们两国都遭受到殖民主义的侵略和压迫。但是，正像帕米尔高原并不能隔绝我们两国一样，殖民主义的势力也不能妨碍我们两国人民之间的友谊。中国人民十分钦佩阿富汗人民对殖民主义的英勇斗争。阿富汗人民民族独立斗争的胜利鼓舞了为自己的民族独立而斗争的中国人民。当我们两国人民摆脱了殖民主义的束缚以后，我们两国的友好关系更在新的基础上发展了起来。
    同许多亚非国家一样，阿富汗和中国都热爱和平和正义。我们两国同许多其他亚非国家一起，在万隆会议上，为促进亚非人民的相互了解和合作，为反对殖民主义和维护世界和平，作了共同的努力。中国人民十分尊重阿富汗在相互尊重的基础上同一切国家友好的政策。中国人民十分钦佩阿富汗支持埃及反抗侵略的正义立场。中国人民还特别感谢阿富汗在恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位的问题上所给予我们的支持。
    中国人民一贯主张，在和平共处五项原则的基础上同一切国家发展友好关系，并且特别重视同毗邻国家的友好和合作。我们十分满意地看到，中阿两国的关系在相互尊重的基础上已经有了良好的发展。我们深信，我们两国人民进一步发展两国友好合作的共同愿望，不仅符合我们两国人民的利益，而且也有利于亚洲和世界的和平。
  我建议：
    为阿富汗国王穆罕默德·查希尔·沙阿陛下的健康，
    为阿富汗王国政府首相穆罕默德·达乌德汗殿下的健康，
    为阿富汗人民的繁荣和幸福，
    为中阿两国日益增进的友谊，
    为亚洲和世界的和平，
    干杯！
