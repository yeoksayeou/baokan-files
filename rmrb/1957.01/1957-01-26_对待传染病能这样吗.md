    To the Editor:
    With extreme anger, I expose to you the bureaucratic work style of the responsible cadres of the Health Department of the Kaixian People's Committee in Sichuan Province. On November 25 last year, the villages of Baiquan and Fengzhu in Baiquan Township, Yanshui District, Kaixian County, suddenly experienced an outbreak of diphtheria and pneumonia. The Yanshui District Office repeatedly requested the County Health Department to immediately send doctors for emergency treatment. However, Deputy Section Chief Luo of the department simply replied each time he received a phone call: "The county has no doctors; find your own solution!" Later, all the doctors from the district health center and the joint clinic, as well as some other doctors in the district, participated in the rescue efforts, but due to limitations in medical expertise, some patients could not be saved. According to a survey by the Yanshui District Office, as of December 15 last year, 502 people in Baiquan and Fengzhu villages (nearly half of the total population of the two villages) had contracted diphtheria and pneumonia, and 35 had died. Furthermore, more than a dozen people in Fengxiang and Zhonggu villages, which are close to Baiquan village, were also found to be infected. The Yanshui District Office repeatedly informed the County Health Department of this serious situation, but Section Chief Chen of the Health Department flatly replied: "Our county's doctors are not available; we cannot send them!" After this, another group of patients who could have been saved died.

### 对待传染病能这样吗

    对待传染病能这样吗编辑同志：
    我以极端愤怒的心情，向你们揭发四川省开县人民委员会卫生科负责干部的官僚主义作风。去年11月25日，开县岩水区白泉乡白泉、枫竹两个村，忽然发生白喉和肺炎传染病。岩水区区公所曾经数次请求县卫生科即速派医生前来抢救。但是，该科骆副科长每次接到电话时，只是回答：“县里没有医生，你们自己设法解决吧！”后来，区卫生所和联合诊所全部医生和区里其他一些医生都参加抢救，但仍因受医疗水平的限制，使得一些患者没有得到挽救。据岩水区区公所的调查统计，截至去年12月15日，白泉、枫竹两村患白喉和肺炎的已有五百零二人（将近两村总人口的一半），已经死亡的有三十五人。并且在接近白泉村的枫箱、钟鼓两个村，也发现有十几个人被传染了。岩水区区公所一再把这种严重的情况告诉县卫生科，谁知卫生科陈科长竟斩钉截铁地回答：“我们县里的医生没有空，不能派！”在这以后，又有一批本来可以挽救的病人又死去了。
