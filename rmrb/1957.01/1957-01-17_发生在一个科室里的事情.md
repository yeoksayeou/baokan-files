    In overcoming the difficulties of insufficient raw materials, the Supply Department of the Shenyang Fan Factory often held "Material Source Analysis" meetings. Before the meeting, they inventoried the materials in stock to find out what they had too much of and what they lacked. After the meeting, in order to find the missing materials, everyone from the department head to the porters used their abilities according to the methods researched in the meeting.
      A Valuable Meeting
    The Shenyang Fan Factory lacked ball bearings, and the manufactured fan parts could not be assembled and shipped. While the head of the supply department, Lin, was troubled by this, the ministry's supply bureau notified him to attend a meeting of supply department heads.
      "An opportunity!" Lin thought. During the meeting, he met with the heads of the supply departments of two ball bearing factories and requested support of three thousand sets of ball bearings. The two department heads replied, "We have difficulties now. Once we find electric motors and the production of ball bearings increases, we can provide even thirty thousand sets."
    Seeing their sincerity in helping, Lin asked, "That would be great. How many electric motors do you need?" After negotiation, and with the approval of the supply bureau, they signed a mutual assistance contract.
    Now, the two ball bearing factories are using thirty-two electric motors that the Shenyang Fan Factory had been holding in stock for more than three years to increase production by hundreds of thousands of sets of ball bearings. The Shenyang Fan Factory exchanged for three thousand sets of ball bearings from the increased production of the two ball bearing factories, and assembled and shipped one thousand five hundred fans ahead of schedule.
  One Should Emit Light and Heat
    The four porters of the Supply Department were always pondering a sentence said by the department head at the "Material Source Analysis" meeting: "One should emit light and heat."
    "Old Ma, what kind of light can we emit?" A porter said while sitting on a broken wooden box, "Come on, let's discuss it." Ma Zhongzhen naturally agreed, because he also wanted to take advantage of the break to discuss the idea he had come up with with everyone.
    "I think," Ma Zhongzhen said with a smile, "You have some wooden boxes at home, would you be willing for me to smash them?"
    "Old Ma, what are you joking about!"
    "It's not a joke, aren't you all sitting on good wooden boxes that have been smashed"? At this time, the porters all woke up.
    Now, the porters are careful when disassembling wooden boxes used for packaging electric motors. They also use their spare time to neatly store a large number of broken wooden boxes and more than a thousand catties of nails according to different sizes. The wooden boxes used for packaging the recent shipment of more than two thousand fans were all nailed together using the wood and nails they saved.
      One Cannot Only Think of Oneself
    Manufacturing fans cannot do without V-belts. However, the Shenyang Fan Factory lacked 30% and had 30% in stock. That is to say, 30% of the V-belt specifications were not suitable for needs.
    There were two different opinions in the Supply Department when solving this problem: Some people believed that the joint state-private rubber belt factory should disrupt their original plan according to the needs of our state-owned factory and produce suitable V-belts for us; however, more people advocated that one cannot only think of oneself and should also see the difficulties of others.
    Finally, the department's representatives first consulted with the joint state-private factory. As a result, the factory director said that they would find ways to overcome the difficulties and definitely help solve the need for V-belts.
    Seeing the spirit of this joint state-private factory to help others, the personnel of the fan factory's supply department were moved and sent people with a manual crane to actively help the factory adjust the unreasonable condition of the equipment installation, and also sent twenty sets of ball bearings to help repair the machine tools, fully exerting production potential and ensuring the supply of V-belts.

    发生在一个科室里的事情
    新华社记者　沈俊海
    沈阳扇风机厂供应科，在克服原材料不足的困难中，经常召开“料源分析”会议。会前，他们清点库存材料，想知道究竟多些什么，缺些什么？会后，为了找到缺少的材料，从科长到搬运工，就都按照会议上研究出来的办法，各显其能。
      有价值的会见
    沈阳扇风机厂缺少滚珠轴承，生产出来的扇风机零件不能装配出厂。这件事正在苦恼着供应科的林科长的时候，刚好部里供应局通知他参加供应科长会议。
      “有机会了！”林科长想。在会议期间，他会见了两个滚珠轴承厂的供应科长，要求支援三千套滚珠轴承。这两位科长回答他说：“现在有困难，等找到了电动机，滚珠轴承增产以后，要三万套都行。”
    林科长看他们有诚心帮助，便问：“那太好啦，你们要多少电动机？”他们经过协商，经供应局批准，签订了互助合同。
    现在两个滚珠轴承厂用沈阳扇风机厂积压了三年多的三十二台电动机，增产了几十万套滚珠轴承；沈阳扇风机厂从两个滚珠轴承厂增产部分里，换取了三千套滚珠轴承，把出产的一千五百台扇风机提前装配出厂了。
  有一分热发一分光
    供应科的四个搬运工，总捉摸着科长在“料源分析”会议上说的一句话：“有一分热，发一分光”。
    “老马，咱们能发什么光啊？”搬运工坐在破木箱上说：“来，研究研究。”马忠镇当然很同意，因为他也想趁着休息的机会，把他想出来的主意同大家研究一下。
    “我想”，马忠镇笑着说：“你们家里有些木箱子，我去把他砸碎了，你们愿意吗？”
    “老马，你开什么玩笑！”
    “不是玩笑，你们坐着的不都是砸碎了的好木箱子吗”？这时搬运工人们都醒悟过来了。
    现在，搬运工在拆卸包装电动机用的木箱子的时候都细心了。他们还利用业余时间，把过去拆坏了的大量木箱和一千多斤钉子，都按大小不同的规格整齐地保管起来。最近出厂的二千多台扇风机，包装用的木箱全是用他们节约下来的木板、钉子钉制起来的。
      不能只顾自己
    制造扇风机，离不开三角带。但是，沈阳扇风机厂缺30％，又积压了30％。这就是说，有30％的三角带规格不适合需要。
    供应科在解决这个问题的时候，有两种不同意见：有人认为公私合营橡胶机带厂应该根据我们国营工厂的需要，打乱他们原来计划，为我们生产适用的三角带；可是，有更多的人主张，不能只顾自己，也要看到人家的困难。
    最后，科的代表先找公私合营工厂商量商量。结果，这个工厂的厂长表示设法克服困难，一定帮助解决三角带的需要。
    扇风机厂供应科人员看见公私合营工厂这种肯帮助别人的精神，便感动地派人带着人力吊车，主动帮助这个工厂调整了设备安装不合理的状况，还送去二十套滚珠轴承，帮助检修了机床，充分发挥了生产潜力，保证了三角带的供应。
