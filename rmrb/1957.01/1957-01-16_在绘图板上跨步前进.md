Designing a 10,000-ton Ocean-Going Freighter

"Design a 10,000-ton ocean-going freighter!" The ship designers in Shanghai were attracted by this new task that might be included in the Second Five-Year Plan.

From the drawing boards of the civilian ship design institution in Shanghai, under the First Ministry of Machine Building's Shipbuilding Industry Administration, one can see that the changes in just a few short years are astonishing. Before 1954, what was depicted here were only barges, motorized junks, dredgers, and small inland river steamers. In 1954, the first coastal passenger-cargo ships designed by China itself appeared, namely the sister ships "Democracy No. 10" and "No. 11," with a displacement of more than 3,600 tons. In 1955, an oil tanker capable of carrying 4,500 tons of oil appeared. In 1956, a 5,000-ton coastal freighter also appeared here. Just as the technical design of this largest coastal freighter designed by China itself was being completed, the designers were preparing to "stride to the ocean."

The designers here, professors from Shanghai Shipbuilding College, and researchers from the Shipbuilding Science Research Institute have enthusiastically started preparing for the design of a 10,000-ton ocean-going freighter. They have already selected about twenty thesis topics, started collecting data, and plan to submit their work in the summer of 1957. Some are preparing to conduct a comprehensive comparative study of 10,000-ton freighters from various countries around the world in modern times, some want to propose design arguments for new hull structures, and some are preparing to study how to utilize advanced shipbuilding technology from around the world. Among all these enterprising topics, the research on the power plant for the 10,000-ton freighter is equally noteworthy. The designers will consider the possibility of using domestically produced steam turbines or heavy-duty diesel engines with tens of thousands of horsepower.

The development of China's power machinery industry is encouraging the ship designers. The coastal passenger-cargo ship designed in 1956 used domestically produced ship power equipment for the first time. Another smaller coastal passenger-cargo ship uses a 600-horsepower diesel engine recently trial-produced by the Shanghai Xinzhong Power Machinery Factory. A 5,000-ton coastal freighter uses a 2,400-horsepower single-flow steam engine that is being trial-produced by a shipyard in Shanghai. The chief engineer here told reporters that the news of a large steam turbine factory being built in Harbin has made the designer in charge of the power plant for the 10,000-ton freighter more inclined to advocate the design of China's first ocean-going giant ship powered by a steam turbine.

Catching Up with the World's Advanced Levels

In the water pool of the Shipbuilding Science Research Institute, interesting model competitions are often held. The model of the 4,500-ton oil tanker has undergone navigation tests under various conditions. It runs faster than several other models of the same tonnage and horsepower, proving that the hull lines of the oil tanker designed by the Chinese designers for the first time are excellent.

In the summer of 1956, a specialized committee organized by the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Communications, with the participation of Soviet experts, reviewed and approved the design of the 4,500-ton oil tanker, believing that the design of this oil tanker was relatively advanced and reached the world level in some aspects. This is a great encouragement for Chinese designers who have only recently begun to try designing ocean-going ships.

The designers collect shipbuilding publications and materials from various countries and visit ocean-going ships from various countries that sail to Shanghai. Even a newly shaped anchor in a foreign magazine's ship photo cannot escape their eyes. They discovered an article introducing this anchor in a German magazine "Ships and Harbors." It turned out that this was a new Spek type anchor that the Dutch shipbuilding industry began to use in 1956. They designed it successfully based on the shape seen in the photo and immediately adopted it in the construction design of the oil tanker this time.

The first 4,500-ton oil tanker designed by ourselves also thinned the outer end thickness of the blade according to the paper published by Romson in the Netherlands in 1952, which increased the propulsion efficiency.

"Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" on Steam Turbines

The Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory, which imitated the first 6,000 kW steam turbine according to Czechoslovakian drawings in 1955, immediately designed a 12,000 kW steam turbine by themselves with reference to several different Czechoslovakian drawings and has already successfully manufactured it. Now, drawings of another high-speed 750 kW steam turbine, completely independently designed by Chinese designers, are being sent to the workshop one by one.

This is a new type of steam turbine designed according to the new needs of small and medium-sized cities, large farms, industrial and mining enterprises, and construction units in China. The speed is more than double that of the 6,000 kW and 12,000 kW (6,500 revolutions per minute), and the entire steam turbine can be disassembled and transported on a car, or it can be modified and placed on a train as the power for a train power station.

In the absence of any ready-made drawings to imitate, the designers launched a discussion.

How many impellers should such a steam turbine have? The members of the design team spent a month calculating the different efficiencies of four, five, six, and seven impellers separately. The conclusion was that using six impellers was the most economical. After reviewing it, the chief designer believed that it was possible to consider using seven impellers with higher efficiency.

A special team for calculating technical data performed the calculation again. As a result, it was calculated that although the seven impellers had relatively high efficiency, they were labor-intensive and material-intensive, and lengthened the fuselage, which was not as cost-effective as six impellers. Finally, the design team's plan was adopted.

The design of the blade root was also determined after a debate. The designers went to Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places to study small, high-speed steam turbines produced by capitalist countries, and searched new materials from various countries for comparison. They found that the design of the blade root on a high-speed steam turbine in the United States was better. After studying it, they decided to refer to this better blade root structure for design. However, the process department disagreed, believing that adopting a new design would require a new set of tools and fixtures, which would increase manufacturing man-hours and difficulties. They requested that the design still follow the blade root structure of the blades produced in the factory. When the final review was conducted, professors from Jiaotong University and experts from the Electric Power Design Institute also participated in the discussion, studied the reasons of both sides, and believed that the time saved in the process could not compensate for the losses caused by the irrationality of the structure, and decided to absorb the advantages of the American design.

The attempt of independent design was successful. New and more varieties of steam turbines—25,000 kW steam turbines, steam turbine-driven large blast furnace blowers, and steam turbines for marine generators... are again placed in front of the first batch of steam turbine designers in New China.

Seeking Advice from Workers

The Harbin Boiler Factory needed a set of semi-automatic welding electrode manufacturing equipment. This task was assigned to the Shanghai Mechanical and Electrical Product Design Company.

No one had seen this equipment before, only a schematic diagram from the other party.

The designers ran to the Bin Cheng Welding Material Factory, which mainly used manual operation, to learn about the knowledge of manufacturing welding electrodes, and explored the laws of semi-automatic machinery from the manual operation of the workers. Experienced workers introduced their operating experience in detail. The worker in charge of the drying equipment told them: what temperature and time can dry the best quality welding electrodes. The designers therefore determined the turnover speed of the drying equipment they were designing.

The medicine mixing machine of Xinyi Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory also aroused the interest of the designers. They designed the mixing machine for welding electrode flux with reference to it. They even went to factories that manufacture "China" brand pencils and "Black and White" toothpaste to find the machinery and equipment needed for reference in the design.

The more than one hundred designers of the Shanghai Mechanical and Electrical Product Design Company are a new design force that was drawn from various joint state-private mechanical and electrical factories. In the previous period, they mainly conducted surveying and mapping design based on physical objects from the Soviet Union and other countries. Semi-automatic welding electrode manufacturing equipment is their first attempt at independent design. Now, they are about to start independently designing various small-sized hydro-generators for rural use with different capacities, which will be used as a unified model for the whole country. Many regions have sent designers to participate.

    在绘图板上跨步前进
    新华社记者　徐中尼　季群　贺昌华	设计万吨远洋巨轮
      “设计一万吨的远洋货轮！”上海的船舶设计师们被这个可能列入第二个五年计划的新任务吸引住了。
    从第一机械工业部船舶工业管理局所属在上海的一个民用船舶设计机构的绘图板上，可以看出短短几年的变化是惊人的。1954年以前，这里描画的还只是些驳船、机帆船、挖泥船和小型内河轮船。1954年，出现了第一种我国自己设计的沿海客货轮，就是排水量三千六百多吨的民主十号和十一号两艘姐妹轮。1955年，出现了一种装油四千五百吨的海上运油轮。1956年，这里又出现了载货五千吨的沿海货轮。当这艘我国自己设计的最大的沿海货轮刚刚完成技术设计的时候，设计师们又准备“跨到远洋去”了。
    这里的设计师、上海造船学院的教授和造船科学研究所的研究员们，都兴致勃勃地开始了设计万吨远洋货轮的准备工作，他们已经分别选定了约二十个论文题目，着手搜集资料，预定在1957年夏季交卷。有的准备把近代世界各国万吨级货轮作综合性比较研究，有的要提出新型船体结构的设计论据，有的准备研究如何利用世界先进的造船工艺……。在所有这些富有进取心的题目中，关于万吨货轮动力装置的研究同样令人注意，设计师将考虑采用国产的具有上万匹马力的汽轮机或是重型柴油机的可能性。
    我国动力机械工业的发展鼓舞着船舶设计师们。1956年设计的沿海客货轮，第一次采用了国产的船舶动力设备。另一种较小型的沿海客货轮采用了上海新中动力机厂最近试制成功的六百匹马力柴油机。一种五千吨沿海货轮，采用了上海一个造船厂正在试制的二千四百匹马力单流式蒸汽机。这里的主任工程师告诉记者说，哈尔滨新建一个大型汽轮机厂的消息，使得主持万吨货轮动力装置的设计师，更加倾向于设计我国第一艘用汽轮机发动的远洋巨轮的主张了。
      追上世界先进水平
    在造船科学研究所的水池里，经常举行着有趣的模型比赛。四千五百吨油轮的模型经过了在各种条件下的航行试验，它比其他几种同样吨位和马力的模型走得快，证明中国设计师第一次设计的油轮船体的线型是优良的。
    1956年夏天，第一机械工业部和交通部组织的一个有苏联专家参加的专门委员会，审查批准了四千五百吨油轮的设计，认为这艘油轮的设计是比较先进的，有些方面达到了世界水平。这对在最近几年才开始尝试设计海轮的中国设计师们是很大的鼓励。
    设计师们搜集各国的造船刊物、资料，参观航行到上海来的各国海轮。即使是外国杂志的轮船照片里有一个新形状的铁锚，也漏不过他们的眼睛。他们从一本德国的“船舶和港湾”杂志上发现了介绍这种铁锚的文章，原来这是荷兰造船工业在1956年开始采用的新的司贝克型铁锚。他们就根据照片上看到的形状设计成功了，这次在油轮的施工设计中马上加以采用。
    第一艘自己设计的四千五百吨油轮，还根据1952年荷兰罗姆森发表的论文，把叶片外端厚度改薄，增加了推进效率。	  关于汽轮机的“百家争鸣”
    1955年按照捷克斯洛伐克图纸仿造了第一台六千瓩汽轮机的上海汽轮机厂，设计师们紧接着参考捷克斯洛伐克几种不同的图纸，自己设计了一万二千瓩汽轮机，并且已经制造成功。现在，另一种完全由中国设计师们独立设计的高速的七百五十瓩汽轮机的图纸，正在一张张向车间发送。
    这是一种根据我国中小城市、大型农场和工矿、建筑单位的新需要设计的汽轮机新品种。转速比六千和一万二千瓩的高一倍多（每分钟六千五百转），整个汽轮机可以拆卸装在汽车上搬运，也可以改装以后安置在火车上作为列车发电站的动力。
    没有任何现成图纸可以仿照的情况下，设计师们展开了讨论。
    这样的汽轮机究竟应该有几个叶轮呢？设计组的人员花了一个月的时间分别计算了四个、五个、六个和七个叶轮的不同效率。结论是采用六个叶轮最经济。总设计师审查以后认为可以考虑采用效率更高的七个叶轮。
    一个专门计算技术数据的小组，再次进行了计算。结果，算出七个叶轮虽然效率比较高，但是费工费料，又加长了机身，不及六个叶轮合算。最后设计组的方案被采用了。
    叶根的设计，也是经过了一番争论以后才确定的。设计人员到无锡、常州等地去研究了资本主义国家出产的小型高转速汽轮机，又翻查了各国的新资料，进行比较，发现美国有一种高转速汽轮机上叶根的设计比较好。他们研究以后决定参考这种较好的叶根结构进行设计。可是，工艺科不同意，认为采用新的设计，要重新准备一套工夹具，增加了制造的工时和困难。要求仍旧照厂里生产的叶片叶根结构进行设计。当最后进行会审的时候，交通大学的教授和电力设计院的专家们也参加了讨论，研究了双方的理由，认为工艺上的省时，补偿不了结构上的不合理所引起的损失，决定吸取美国设计中的长处。
    自行设计的尝试成功了。新的更多品种的汽轮机——二万五千瓩汽轮机、汽轮机带动的大型高炉鼓风机和船用发电机的汽轮机……，又摆在新中国第一批汽轮机设计师的面前了。
          向工人讨教
    哈尔滨锅炉厂需要一套半自动化的电焊条制造设备。这个任务交到了上海市机电产品设计公司。
    谁也没有见过这种设备，只有对方交来的一份示意图。
    设计人员们跑到了主要是手工操作的斌诚电焊材料制造厂，学习制造电焊条的知识，从工人们的手工操作中摸索出半自动化机械的规律。有经验的工人详细介绍了他们的操作经验。管理烘干设备的工人告诉他们：多少温度和时间，可以烘出质量最好的电焊条。设计人员们因此确定了正在设计的烘干设备的周转速度。
    信谊化学制药厂的制药搅拌机，也引起了设计人员们的兴趣，他们参考着它设计了电焊条焊剂的搅拌机。他们甚至到制造“中华”牌铅笔和制造“黑白”牙膏的工厂里，去寻找设计中所需要参考的机器设备。
    上海市机电产品设计公司的一百多个设计人员，是从各个公私合营机电工厂中抽调集中起来的一支新的设计力量。前一时期他们主要是根据苏联和其他国家的实物进行测绘设计的。半自动化的电焊条制造设备是他们一次自行设计的尝试。现在，他们就要开始自行设计农村用的各种不同容量的小型水轮发电机，这种发电机并将作为全国统一的型号。许多地区都派了设计人员来参加。
