    Discussion on the Periodization of Ancient Chinese History

    At Shandong University
    The Scientific Research Committee of Shandong University and the Editorial Board of the "Wen Shi Zhe" (Literature, History, and Philosophy) magazine jointly held a symposium on the afternoon of January 6th. Combining the two articles recently published in newspapers and magazines: Guo Moruo's "The Han Dynasty Regime Severely Crushed Slave Owners" (see People's Daily, December 6, 1956) and Nikiforov's "On Several Common Regularities in the Transition from Slave Ownership to Feudalism in Different Countries" (see Historical Research, 1956, No. 10), a discussion was conducted on the periodization of ancient Chinese history.

    The following individuals spoke at the meeting: Tong Shuye, Wu Dakun, Wang Zhongluo, Gao Heng, Zhang Weihua, Zhao Lisheng, Shi Xizhe, Han Lianqi, and others.

    Professor Tong Shuye advocates the Western Zhou feudalism theory. Two years ago, he advocated that the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties were the beginning of feudal society. He believes that after the Zhou Dynasty destroyed the Yin, influenced by advanced economy and culture, productivity rapidly improved. On one hand, the slave system was still developing slowly; on the other hand, due to the enslavement of conquered Yin people and farmers of other tribes (also enslaving their own farmers), relatively widespread primitive serfdom gradually emerged. This relationship, combined with the patriarchal system and the enfeoffment system, formed a precocious patriarchal feudal society. He believes that Nikiforov's article has a complete and thorough theoretical system. However, he has several different opinions on this article. He disagrees with Nikiforov's statement that sometimes tenancy relations cannot explain anything and cannot indicate what the social system was like at the time. He believes that tenancy is an economic system that only appears under certain social conditions. He also believes that Nikiforov's point that rural communes in China's feudal era often took the form of clan communes, and that Chinese feudal society was patriarchal in nature, is completely correct; the argument that feudalism is often combined with the commune system has unique insights. However, he believes that the communes remaining in slave society and the communes rebuilt in the feudal era have different natures. The communes remaining in slave society are a continuation of the primitive communes; the communes re-established in the feudal era have an artificial nature. Regarding Guo Moruo's article, he said: Mr. Guo's view that Confucius's doctrine is a feudal theory is correct, but he disagrees with Mr. Guo's setting the beginning of the feudal era in the Warring States period, which would require treating Confucius's doctrine as an advanced ideology of slave society.

    Professor Wu Dakun advocates the Warring States feudalism theory. He believes that Nikiforov's article is worth studying, but he disagrees with Nikiforov's view that the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties were the beginning of Chinese feudal society. He analyzed the significance of the use of iron tools for the development of human history. He believes that during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, the discovery of iron and the widespread use of cheap iron tools made it possible for farmers to engage in individual production, thus disintegrating the original commune organization and leading to the emergence of feudal society. He said that iron tools alone cannot determine whether it is a feudal society; but if it is a feudal society, it must have iron.

    Professor Wang Zhongluo advocates that the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties were the beginning of Chinese feudal society. He said that if the Western Zhou or the turn of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods were said to be the beginning of Chinese feudal society, many historical issues (such as the flourishing of commerce in the Qin and Han Dynasties but its regression in the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, etc.) would be difficult to explain; if the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties were determined to be the beginning of feudal society, it would be easier to explain. Regarding the use of iron tools, he believes that iron can disintegrate rural communes, but iron was softer than bronze at the beginning, and even if iron was used in the Spring and Autumn period, it may not have been widely used by the Warring States period. Among the Han Dynasty tools unearthed, there are not only bronzes but also stone tools, which shows that iron may not have been widely used at that time. In his speech, Wang Zhongluo also raised different opinions on Guo Moruo's article. He believes that the slave system in the Han Dynasty had aristocratic characteristics, and the autocratic monarchy was relatively strong; the development of industry and commerce would disintegrate the countryside and affect the regime's exploitation target—small farmers. Therefore, it was natural for the Han Dynasty regime to crack down on slave owners, especially when the slave system crisis began, the crackdown was even heavier.

    Professor Gao Heng advocates the Western Zhou feudalism theory. He once examined this issue from the land rent system of the Zhou Dynasty. His speech was divided into three points: First, iron tools may have already been used in the Western Zhou. Second, the development from serfdom to tenancy is only possible with iron tools. However, in the early stages of feudal society (from slave system to serfdom), iron tools are not necessarily required. Third, although it is currently impossible to confirm whether there were iron tools in the Western Zhou Dynasty, even if there were no iron tools in the Western Zhou Dynasty, it still cannot be concluded that the Western Zhou could not be a feudal society.

    Professor Zhang Weihua disagrees with the Western Zhou feudalism theory, and does not fully agree with the Spring and Autumn and Warring States and Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties theories. He believes that the period from the Spring and Autumn and Warring States to the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties was a transition period from slave system to feudalism. During this period, the slave system still existed, and feudalism also developed. By the Southern and Northern Dynasties, feudalism was quite mature, but it cannot be said to be the beginning of feudal society. He said that it is difficult to say how many slaves there were in the Western Zhou Dynasty and what position production occupied; but it is certain that by the Western Han Dynasty, there were quite a few debt slaves, and it is not in line with the facts to say that the slave system did not develop. However, on the other hand, feudalism was also developing at the same time.

    Professor Zhao Lisheng advocates the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties feudalism theory. He believes that the Three Kingdoms Cao Wei was a clear beginning of feudal society. He fully agrees with Nikiforov's opinion. He believes that Guo Moruo's Warring States feudalism theory has a blood relationship with the Wei-Jin feudalism theory and is relatively close. However, he believes that Confucius's thought cannot be regarded as the representative and typical of feudal thought. He said that this is a misunderstanding, which is related to the "Down with the Confucian Shop" slogan put forward after the May Fourth Movement. Confucianism is a constantly changing system from slave system to feudalism, in which there are feudal elements. The characteristics of feudal society are natural economy, which is manifested in consciousness as mediocrity, stagnation, and tediousness. Confucius and Dong Zhongshu do not have these characteristics. Only the thought from Zheng Xuan to Kong Yingda is the culmination of feudal thought.

    Shi Xizhe advocates the Western Zhou feudalism theory. He believes that Nikiforov's article does not pay enough attention to the characteristics of China's slave system. He believes that to solve the problem of periodization of ancient Chinese history, one should grasp the unique aspects of ancient Chinese history. He put forward three opinions: First, it is necessary to determine the standards for slaves and serfs. Second, distinguish between Eastern slave systems and classical slave systems. Third, in-depth study of Marxist-Leninist classics is needed.

    Associate Professor Han Lianqi advocates the Wei-Jin feudalism theory. He believes that from the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, Chinese society developed along two paths, namely the slave system and the tenancy system. He expressed his opinion on the Confucian issue. He believes that the Warring States period was a slave society, and its superstructure was Legalism, not Confucianism. Confucius's thought was advanced at that time. There are two schools of Legalists: one is the Guan Zhong school, which emphasizes commerce and undervalues agriculture, representing the emerging slave owners and being the opposition faction; the other is the Shang Yang and Han Feizi school, which emphasizes agriculture and undervalues commerce, being the ruling faction.

    At Sichuan University
    At the end of 1956, the Chinese History Teaching and Research Group of the History Department of Sichuan University organized a symposium on the issue of the periodization of Chinese slave system and feudal system, with more than 300 participants.

    The focus of the discussion was the social nature of the Western Zhou Dynasty. Professor Xu Zhongshu believes that the Western Zhou Dynasty was a feudal society. He said that although there were no iron tools in the Western Zhou Dynasty, the level of productivity in agriculture at that time, in terms of production tools, production technology, fertilization technology, and yield, had reached the level of feudal society. He also emphasized the difference between the slave system and the feudal system, using the example of the slave society that existed in the Chinese border areas, to demonstrate the characteristics of the Western Zhou feudal system.

    Professor Hu Jianmin's opinion is completely opposite to Xu Zhongshu's, believing that the Western Zhou Dynasty was a slave society. The Western Zhou slave system was a continued development of the Yin Shang slave system. Based on the production conditions at that time, its degree of development still did not exceed the low-level form of ancient Eastern style. He believes that the Yin and Zhou period was still the Bronze Age, and primitive agriculture and family handicraft industry did not have significant development. From the social and economic foundation and superstructure of the Western Zhou Dynasty, no traces of feudalism can be found. He believes that the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods were the highest development stage of the slave system, and also the transitional stage from the slave system to the feudal system. Only after the Qin and Han Dynasties was it a feudal society. He believes that the crux of ancient history periodization research lies in the fact that there are relatively few problems in terms of historical materials. Although there is still a lack of key materials in this regard, there are already a large number of recognized materials; and there are relatively large problems in terms of theory, viewpoint, and method.

    Regarding the question of whether the productivity of the Western Zhou society was developed, Comrade Tang Jiahong, based on the production technology and yield per unit area of agriculture, the main production sector at that time, and comparing the Western Zhou, Spring and Autumn, Warring States and the same period in Europe, believes that the productivity level of the Western Zhou society was relatively high and not as primitive as Hu Jianmin said. However, he also expressed doubt about Xu Zhongshu's view that the level of productivity had reached that of feudal society at that time.

    Using the data from world ancient history combined with the research on ancient Chinese history, Comrade Wu Huaqian determined that the Western Zhou Dynasty was a stage where the primitive slave system was dominant.

    Several other comrades also spoke at the meeting, and they put forward their own views on issues such as the use of historical materials and the level of productivity in the Western Zhou Dynasty. (Jia Hong)

    中国古史分期问题的讨论
    在山东大学
    山东大学科学研究委员会和文史哲杂志编委会，在1月6日下午，联合举行了一次学术座谈会，结合了最近报刊上发表的两篇文章：郭沫若“汉代政权严重打击奴隶主”（见人民日报1956年12月6日）和尼基甫洛夫“论不同国家从奴隶占有制向封建制过渡的几个共同的规律性”（见历史研究1956年第10期），对中国古史分期问题进行了讨论。
    在会上先后发言的有：童书业、吴大琨、王仲荦、高亨、张维华、赵俪生、时希哲、韩连琪等人。
    童书业教授是主张西周封建说的。而在两年以前，他曾经主张魏晋南北朝是封建社会的开始。他认为：周灭殷以后，受先进的经济和文化的影响，生产力迅速提高，一面奴隶制关系还在缓慢地发展着，同时由于奴役被征服的殷国和其他部族的农民（也奴役自己的农民），逐渐发生了比较广泛的原始农奴制关系；这种关系与宗法制和分封制结合着，形成了早熟的宗法封建社会。他认为尼基甫洛夫的文章的理论系统是完备通达的。但对这篇文章有几点不同的意见。他不同意尼基甫洛夫同志所说，有的时候租佃关系不能说明任何问题，不能表明当时的社会制度是怎样的。认为，租佃关系是一种经济制度，只有在一定的社会条件下，才会出现。他又认为尼基甫洛夫同志指出中国封建时代的农村公社常取氏族公社的形式，指出中国封建社会的宗法性，这是完全正确的；关于封建制往往与公社制相结合的论点，有独特见解。但他认为残留在奴隶社会里的公社和封建时代重建起来的公社，有不同的性质。残留在奴隶社会的公社，是原始公社的继续；封建时代重新建立起来的公社，则带有人为性质。对于郭沫若先生的文章，他说：郭先生认为孔子学说是封建理论，这是对的，但郭先生把封建时代的开始定在战国，这就必须把孔子学说当作奴隶社会的先进思想，则不同意。
  　吴大琨教授是主张战国封建说。他认为尼基甫洛夫同志的文章值得学习，但他不同意尼基甫洛夫的魏晋南北朝是中国封建社会开始的说法。他分析了铁器的使用对人类历史发展的意义。认为，春秋战国时，铁的发现和便宜的铁器的被广泛使用，使农民有了从事个体生产的可能，因而瓦解了原有的公社组织，出现了封建社会。并说，单单有铁器，不能决定是否是封建社会；而是封建社会，则一定要有铁。
    王仲荦教授是主张魏晋南北朝是中国封建社会的开始。他说，如果把西周或春秋战国之交说成是中国封建社会的开始，好些历史问题（如秦汉商业发达到魏晋南北朝反而倒退了等等）便无法解释；如果定魏晋南北朝是封建社会的开始，便好解释了。关于铁器的使用，他认为铁可以瓦解农村公社，但铁在开始时，比青铜还柔软，即使春秋时已用铁，到战国时也不一定能普遍使用。在发掘出来的汉代工具中，不仅有青铜器，还有石器，这说明铁不一定已被当时广泛使用。王仲荦发言中，并对郭沫若先生文章提出了不同意见。他认为两汉奴隶制带贵族性质，专制主义王权较强；工商业的发展会瓦解农村，影响政权的剥削对象——小农。因此，汉代政权打击奴隶主是自然的，特别是奴隶制危机开始，也就打击更重。
    高亨教授主张西周封建说，他曾经从周代地租制度上考证过这个问题。他的发言分三点：一、西周可能已经使用铁器。二、从农奴制发展为佃农制，是必须有了铁器，才有可能。但是封建社会初期（从奴隶制发展到农奴制），就不一定非有铁器不可。三、西周时代有没有铁器现在虽无法肯定，但即使西周还没有铁器，也仍然不能断定西周就不可能是封建社会。
    张维华教授不同意西周封建说，也不十分同意春秋战国和魏晋南北朝的说法。他认为春秋战国到魏晋南北朝，是一个从奴隶制到封建制的过渡时期，在这时期内，奴隶制还存在，封建制也发展着。到南北朝封建制已相当成熟，但还不能说是封建社会的开始。他说，西周究竟有多少奴隶，生产占何地位，很难说；但肯定的说，到西汉，债务奴隶相当多，说奴隶制不发展，不合事实。但另一方面，封建制同时也发展着。
    赵俪生教授主张魏晋南北朝封建说。他认为三国曹魏是封建社会明显的开始。他完全赞同尼基甫洛夫的意见。他认为郭沫若先生的战国封建论，和魏晋封建论有血缘关系，比较接近。但他认为不能把孔子思想作为封建思想的代表和典型。他说，这是一种误会，这和“五四”运动后提出的“打倒孔家店”有关。儒家思想是奴隶制到封建制不断变化的体系，其中有封建的成分。封建社会的特征是自然经济，在意识上表现为平庸、停滞和烦琐的特点，孔子和董仲舒都不具备这特点，只有郑玄到孔颖达的思想，才是集封建思想的大成。
    时希哲主张西周封建说。他认为尼基甫洛夫的文章对中国的奴隶制特点注意不够，他认为要解决中国古史分期问题，应抓住中国古史特有的东西。他提出三点意见：一、要确定奴隶与农奴的标准。二、把东方奴隶制和古典奴隶制相区别。三、对马克思列宁主义的经典著作，要深入研究。
    韩连琪副教授是主张魏晋封建说的。他认为从春秋战国开始，中国社会分两条道路发展，即奴隶制和租佃制。他对儒家问题发表了意见。他认为，战国是奴隶社会，它的上层建筑是法家，而不是儒家。孔子的思想在当时是先进的。法家有两派：一是管子派，重商轻农，代表新兴奴隶主，是在野派；一是商鞅、韩非子派，重农轻商，是在朝派。　　　　（山东大学通讯组）
    在四川大学
    1956年底，四川大学历史系中国史教研组组织了一次中国奴隶制和封建制的分期问题的座谈会，参加的有三百余人。
    讨论的重点是西周的社会性质。徐中舒教授认为西周是封建社会。他说，西周虽然没有铁器，但从当时农业的生产工具、生产技术、施肥技术和产量来说，已达到了封建社会生产力的水平。他还着重地用中国边区存在过的奴隶社会为例，说明奴隶制和封建制的差别，论证了作为西周封建制的特征。
    胡鉴民教授的意见和徐中舒完全相反，认为西周是奴隶社会。西周奴隶制是殷商奴隶制的继续发展。依据当时的生产状况，其发展程度仍未超过古代东方式的低级形态。他认为殷周之际仍是青铜时代，原始农业和家庭手工业都没有显著的发展，从西周的社会经济基础和上层建筑上不能找出任何封建制的迹象。他认为春秋战国是奴隶制的最高发展阶段，也是奴隶制向封建制过渡阶段，秦汉以后才是封建制社会。他认为古史分期研究的症结，在于史料方面的问题比较小，这方面虽然还缺乏关键性的材料，但已有大量被公认的材料；而在理论、观点、方法方面的问题比较大。
    关于西周社会生产力是否发达的问题，唐家弘同志根据当时主要的生产部门——农业的生产技术和单位面积的产量，以西周、春秋、战国和欧洲的同一时期比较，认为西周社会生产力水平是较高的，并不如胡鉴民所说的那样原始。但对徐中舒的认为当时已达到封建社会生产力的水平，也表示怀疑。
    用世界古代史上的资料结合中国古史进行比较研究的结果，伍化千同志断定西周是原始奴隶制占优势的阶段。
    在会上发言的还有好几位同志，他们分别对史料的运用、西周的生产力水平等问题，提出了自己的见解。（嘉宏）
