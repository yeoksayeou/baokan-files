Economical and Practical Adobe Arch Buildings
Li Qian

Recently, two gray-yellow buildings have been newly built near the office building of the Xi'an Design Institute. The rooms are fitted with large glass windows, and the building has a beautiful corridor. These two buildings did not cost a single steel bar or a single jin of cement, and were built entirely of adobe and a small amount of brick and wood.

Since the second quarter of last year, due to the shortage of steel and cement, the situation of civil construction projects being suspended and waiting for materials has been very serious. In order to overcome this difficulty, the designers of the Xi'an Design Institute conducted several studies and proposed that ordinary dormitories and offices do not need to use mixed structures, and even bricks and wood should be used as little as possible. To be cautious, they went to ask Vice Mayor Yang Xiaochu for instructions. Vice Mayor Yang not only agreed with this opinion, but also suggested that they design some cave-style houses. The designers considered that Xi'an is a seventh-degree earthquake zone, so how to solve the problem of earthquake resistance when designing adobe arch cave dwellings? Vice Mayor Yang reminded them: "There are many cave-style houses among the people, you can study them and absorb the excellent building experience of the people." After that, they invited an old worker from Gansu Province who was very experienced in building cave dwellings.

The old worker said: "Our family's cave dwelling was built by my grandfather. After the earthquake in 1920, some bungalows collapsed, but the cave dwelling did not collapse, and people still live in it now." Although the designers believed the old worker's words, they were still not sure how much pressure the adobe arch roof could withstand. They asked the old worker to build an adobe arch and conducted an experiment, which proved that the ultimate strength of this kind of house is about 4,000 kilograms per square meter, far exceeding the load-bearing requirements of ordinary brick and wood structures.

After dispelling their concerns, the designers worked with the old worker to design a two-story adobe cave dwelling building. And with the help of the old worker, the house was quickly built.

This kind of house is very comfortable to live in. Its exterior does not show an arch shape, and the interior is plastered very beautifully. Each room has one or two large glass windows at both ends, with good air circulation and sufficient light, and there is no difference from ordinary brick and wood structure houses. And because its walls are thick, its heat preservation and sound insulation ability is better than ordinary houses, and it is very quiet to live in.

Building adobe cave dwelling buildings has many significant advantages over ordinary brick and wood structure buildings. First, more than 60% of the building materials are yellow clay. If it is promoted in areas with yellow clay, materials can be obtained locally, saving transportation costs. Second, the cost per square meter is only more than 26 yuan, which is 50% cheaper than mixed structure buildings and about 35% cheaper than brick and wood structure buildings. Third, this kind of building has strong fire resistance and is suitable for use as a warehouse for storing flammable materials in addition to being used as a dormitory.

After the completion of the adobe arch building, it has attracted attention from all aspects. The Jiangxi Province and Harbin City Design Institutes and the Luoyang City Visiting Group have all visited these two houses and asked the Xi'an Design Institute for blueprints to take back. Soviet design experts from Beijing who came to Xi'an also made a special visit to this new type of house, believing that it can be vigorously promoted. Now, some units in Xi'an are starting to build houses of this structure.

    经济适用的土坯拱楼房
    李茜
    最近，在西安市设计院的办公楼附近，新建起两幢灰黄色的楼房。房间里安着宽大的玻璃窗户，楼上有漂亮的走廊。这两幢楼房没有费一根钢材和一斤水泥，完全是用土坯和少量砖、木建筑起来的。
    去年第二季度以来，由于钢材和水泥供不应求，民用建筑停工待料的情况很严重。西安市设计院的设计人员为了克服这个困难，进行多次的研究，提出了普通的宿舍和办公室不必采用混合结构，甚至连砖和木材也尽量少用的方案。为了慎重起见，他们去请示杨晓初副市长。杨副市长不仅同意了这个意见，并且还建议他们设计一些窑洞式的房子，设计人员考虑到西安是七级地震区，设计建筑土坯拱的窑洞，怎样解决防震问题呢？杨副市长提醒他们说：“民间有很多窑洞式的房子，可以研究一下，吸取民间的优良建筑经验。”此后，他们就从甘肃省请来了一位对建筑窑洞很有经验的老工人。
    这位老工人说：“我们家的窑洞是祖父手上建起来的，经过1920年的地震，有些平房都倒了，窑洞没有倒，直到现在还有人住着。”设计人员虽然相信了老工人的话，但是，土坯拱屋顶究竟能承受多大压力，还不摸底。他们请老工人砌了一个土坯拱，做了一次试验，证实这种房子每平方公尺的极限强度达四千公斤左右，远远超过一般砖木结构房子承重的要求。
    设计人员打消顾虑以后，就和老工人共同研究，设计出两层的土坯窑洞楼房。并且在老工人的帮助下，很快地把房子建成了。
    这种房子住起来很舒服。它的外面不露拱形，里面粉刷得很漂亮，每间房子两端都有一两个大玻璃窗，空气流通，光线充足，和一般砖木结构的房子并无差别。又因为它的墙壁厚，保温、隔音的能力比一般房子还好，住起来很安静。
    建筑土坯窑洞楼房比一般砖木结构楼房，有很多显著的优点。第一，60％以上的建筑材料是黄粘土。如果在黄粘土的地区推广，可以就地取材，节约运费。第二、每平方公尺造价仅二十六元多，比混合结构的楼房便宜50％，比砖木结构的楼房便宜35％左右。第三、这种楼房防火性能强，除做宿舍外，还适于做储存易燃物资的仓库。
    土坯拱楼房建成以后，引起了各方面的重视。江西省和哈尔滨市设计院、洛阳市参观团，都参观了这两幢房子，并且向西安市设计院要了图纸带回去。从北京来西安的苏联设计专家也特意参观了这座新型房子，认为可以大力推广。现在，西安市有些单位正着手建筑这种结构的房子。
