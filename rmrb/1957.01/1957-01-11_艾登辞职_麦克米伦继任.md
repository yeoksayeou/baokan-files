Xinhua News Agency, London, 10th. British Prime Minister Eden resigned on the 9th. On the evening of the 9th, after chairing his last cabinet meeting at 10 Downing Street, he went to Buckingham Palace to submit his resignation to the British Queen.

In a personal statement issued after his resignation, Eden said his "health has not recovered sufficiently" to allow him to continue in his job.

It is believed here that the reason for Eden's resignation is the complete failure of the government's policy on the Suez issue and the further undermining of the already weakened British Empire's position in the Near and Middle East by the new U.S. Middle East plan. It is pointed out that this is the first step taken by the government and the Conservative Party in seriously re-evaluating their policies to deal with growing domestic discontent and instability within the government and the Conservative Party.

Recent developments have shown that some changes have become necessary. The sharp reduction in votes for the Conservative Party in the recent by-elections in Milton and Mobberley was a warning. If this happens elsewhere, the Conservative Party will certainly lose its parliamentary majority in the general election.

A recent opinion poll conducted by the "News Chronicle" also showed that at the end of December last year, 49% of the votes supported the Labour Party and 43% supported the Conservative Party; while in early November, 46% of the votes supported the Conservative Party and 45% supported the Labour Party.

(Editor's note) Eden succeeded Churchill as British Prime Minister on April 6, 1955. They are both leaders of the British Conservative Party. The Conservative Party defeated the Labour Party in the 1951 general election to become the ruling party. In the May 1955 general election, the Conservative Party won again. Elections for members of the British House of Commons are held every five years. However, due to political instability, general elections are often held earlier.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th. London dispatch: The British Queen today appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer Macmillan to succeed Eden as the new British Prime Minister.

### 艾登辞职  麦克米伦继任

    艾登辞职
    麦克米伦继任
    新华社伦敦10日电　英国首相艾登已经在9日辞职。9日晚，他在唐宁街十号主持了他最后一次内阁会议以后，去白金汉宫向英国女王提出了辞呈。
    艾登在辞职后发表的一项个人声明中说，他的“健康没有恢复到足以”使他继续担任他的工作。
    这里认为，艾登辞职的原因是政府对苏伊士问题的政策的彻底失败和美国提出的新中东计划进一步破坏了英帝国在中近东已经削弱的阵地。人们指出，这是政府和保守党在严肃地重新估计它们的政策以对付国内日益增长的不满，和对付政府与保守党内部的不稳时所采取的第一个步骤。
    最近的情况表明，进行某些改变已经成为必要的了。前些日子保守党在密尔敦、莫勃莱补缺选举中票数的急剧减少是一个警告。如果别的地方也出现这种情况，那末，保守党准会在大选期间失去它的议会多数。
      “新闻纪事报”最近举行的民意测验也表明，在去年12月底，支持工党的票数有49％，支持保守党的有43％；而在11月初的时候，有46％的票数支持保守党，45％支持工党。
      （编者注）艾登是在1955年4月6日接替丘吉尔担任英国首相的。他们都是英国保守党的领袖。保守党在1951年大选中击败了工党，而成为执政党。1955年5月大选结果，保守党仍获胜。英国下院议员选举，规定每五年举行一次。但由于政局动荡不定，常提前举行大选。
    新华社10日讯　伦敦消息：英国女王今天指定财政大臣麦克米伦继任艾登为英国新首相。
