These days, the city and suburbs of the capital are filled with a welcoming festive atmosphere. The unique atmosphere of the traditional festival, coupled with snowflakes dancing in the sky, foreshadowing a bumper harvest, fills the hearts of adults and children with an unspeakable joy and hope. In flower houses and flower shops, winter jasmine, wintersweet, roses, camellias, crabapples, daffodils and other fresh flowers are in full bloom, revealing the news that spring is coming soon.

Let People Enjoy the Festival
Several bustling streets are even more lively. The counters and windows of several thousand state-owned and joint state-private stores are decorated beautifully and uniquely. Everywhere there are colorful characters made of merchandise spelling out "Welcoming Spring" and "Happy Spring Festival," welcoming several times more customers than usual. Every day at dawn, many housewives get up early, carrying their pre-planned "New Year goods" lists, to go to retail stores or vegetable markets to buy things. Places selling firecrackers, New Year pictures, lanterns, and children's toys attract crowds of children all day long. Staff in service industries such as hairdressing, bathhouses, laundry, and tailoring are serving the last batch of late customers before the festival, ironing the last few clothes; after more than ten days of "tension," they finally feel incredibly relaxed.

In order to let people enjoy the Spring Festival, commercial workers have canceled various holidays for more than a week, transporting goods day and night, extending business hours, and adding hundreds of temporary sales stations, trying to expand the cargo yards and facilitate customer purchases. Many leading cadres are constantly touring between stores all day long, helping with the work.

Thanks to the enthusiastic support of farmers selling various sideline products to the city, the city's supply of pork, chickens, fish, shrimp, and vegetables this year has increased compared to last year, despite insufficient supplies of non-staple foods. Just before the Spring Festival, members of agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs were braving the cold, transporting freshly picked leek sprouts and other delicate vegetables from greenhouses into the city for citizens to use as dumpling fillings.

New Year's items are all prepared, and many families are discussing how to visit "Changdian" during the Spring Festival and what kind of kites and windmills to buy for their children. This annual grand gathering will be even larger this year. Here, people can not only buy various folk toys, handicrafts, and famous Beijing specialties, but also choose from various local and special products from other places in a newly opened free market. During the gathering, the local cultural center will also hold folk art performances such as stilt walking, wheelbarrow shows, and lion dances. Beijing Floriculture Company is also mobilizing various fresh flowers, preparing to display them here for visitors to enjoy.

Remembering the Farmers During the Festival
When the whole city is immersed in the joy of the festival, people have not forgotten the farmers. The city and countryside are closely connected. For a month, many trains and cars have been constantly transporting New Year goods and festival supplies to the countryside day and night. Many factories and handicraft production cooperatives began to rush-produce various durable goods such as children's hats and socks for farmers as early as late December last year. Dongxiaoshi Market, which is particularly closely connected with the countryside, saw unprecedented prosperity before the Spring Festival. It receives hundreds and thousands of farmers, rural vendors, and business personnel from county supply and marketing cooperatives who come to purchase "New Year goods" every day; in the past month or so, sales of goods have exceeded six million yuan, almost equaling the sales of a department store for a month, which is several times more than usual, more than half of which were transported and sold to the vast rural areas of Hebei, Shanxi and other provinces. On countless rows of cargo platforms, piled with farmers' favorite hairnets, velvet head ropes, children's hats, shoe flowers, hairpins, printed handkerchiefs, New Year pictures and small round mirrors and other commodities, colorful, like a beautiful colored picture. These goods are often sold out as soon as they are put out. The 30,000 dozen children's hats produced by eight hat-making production cooperatives in a month or so were almost all sold to the countryside in this way. The more than 10,000 printed handkerchiefs that were put on the market before the Spring Festival, with different colors printed with stories such as "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" and "Cowherd and Weaver Girl," were particularly popular among farmers and were really in short supply. All kinds of velvet head ropes and shoe flowers for girls have also been sold to the countryside in large quantities recently. Farmers are generally satisfied with the types, colors, and quality of goods supplied by this market during this year's Spring Festival.

In the Rural Areas of Beijing's Suburbs
In the rural areas of the capital's suburbs, bustling Spring Festival temple fairs and markets have sprung up, and farmers are busily rushing to the market to buy New Year goods. More than a thousand cooperative distribution points distributed in various townships have supplied the prepared brown sugar, meat, red paper for writing couplets, New Year pictures and other New Year goods to the farmers, of which there were more than 200,000 New Year pictures alone. In the remote Lucun Village in the Nanyuan District, the cleaning team composed of elderly people cleaned the streets of the whole village spotlessly before the Spring Festival. The central store, hung with New Year pictures, was simply transformed into a children's world every day, some helping their mothers buy things, and some jumping and singing in front of the counters. In the past four or five days, the store's daily sales have exceeded 1,000 yuan, more than double the usual amount. In the past, this place rarely supplied printed cloth, but this time more than a dozen bolts were added, which was very attractive. A female member named Jia Guizhi happily bought ten feet of floral serge before the festival, preparing to rush-make new clothes for her two children for the festival. The store's two mobile sales carts traveled around the nearby villages all day long, selling various non-staple foods, cotton cloth, daily necessities, and other items for the festival. Almost every household in the village hung newly purchased New Year pictures. The elderly especially like the heroic images of Liu Hulan and Huang Jiguang, hanging them high in the center of the room, looking at them carefully again and again. The young female member Cui Xiuying seems to be happier than anyone else these days, smiling from ear to ear whenever she sees someone, because she is getting married during the Spring Festival. Her mother, who is over sixty years old, only has this one daughter, and had long wanted to buy her more things in the town, but her daughter refused, saying: Everyone is saving on everything, and although marriage is a major event, you can't spend more money. Since this is the case, the mother is unwilling to quarrel with her daughter, but fortunately, the store in the village is well-stocked with everything, and she quickly prepared the dowry. The mother also specially bought three pounds of meat and more than ten pounds of flour, ready to entertain relatives and friends.

People are joyfully welcoming spring - another spring to prepare for a new bumper harvest.

    笑迎春
    卢恭敏
    这些日子，首都城内和郊区到处喜气迎人。传统节日所特有的气氛，加上天空飞舞着预兆丰年的雪花，使得成年人和孩童心头上都充满着一种说不出的欢乐和希望。花房和鲜花店里，迎春、腊梅、月季、茶花、海棠、水仙等鲜花正在盛开，向人们透露着春天快要到来的消息。
    让人们愉快地过节
    几条繁华的大街更加热闹了。几千家国营和公私合营商店的货柜和橱窗里，都陈设得美丽而别致。到处是以商品组成的“迎春”和“春节快乐”的彩色字样，迎接着比平常多几倍的顾客。每天天一亮，许多家庭主妇就匆忙起床，带着早已计划好的“年货”单，到零售店或菜市场买东西。在卖鞭炮、年画、灯笼和儿童玩具的地方，终日吸引着成群的孩子。理发、浴室、洗染、缝纫等服务行业的人员，在节前正为最后一批迟来的顾客服务，烫熨最后的几件衣服；接连十多天的“紧张”，总算过去了，他们觉得全身无比的轻松。
    商业工作者为了让人们愉快地过春节，一周多来，取消了各种休假，夜以继日地调运着商品，延长营业时间，还增设了成百个临时售货站，想办法扩大货场，便利顾客购买。许多领导干部一天到晚不停地巡回在商店之间，帮助工作。
    由于农民踊跃出售各种副业产品支持城市，在副食品供应不足的情况下，今年全市供应的猪肉、小鸡、鱼虾和蔬菜，都比去年增加了。就在春节前夕，郊区农业生产合作社的社员，还在冒着寒冷，把刚从温室摘下的韭黄等细菜运进城里，供应市民做饺子馅用。
    过节的东西都准备好了，许多家庭在商量着春节怎样逛“厂甸”，给孩子买什么样的风筝和风车。这个一年一度的盛大集会，今年规模更大了。在这里人们不但能买到各种民间玩具、工艺品和北京的著名特产，在新辟的一个自由市场上，还将可选购外地的各种土、特产品。集会期间，当地文化馆还要举办高跷、小车会、耍狮子等民间艺术表演。北京市花木公司也正在调集各种鲜花，准备在这里摆出来供游人欣赏。
    过节不忘庄稼人
    当整个城市沉浸在节日欢乐中的时候，人们并没有忘掉农民。城市和乡村紧密地相连着。一个月来，昼夜不断有许多列车和汽车，满载着年货和节日需用的商品运往农村。许多工厂和手工业生产合作社，早在去年12月下旬开始，就为农民赶制着小孩帽子、袜子等各种结实耐用的商品。同农村联系特别密切的东晓市市场，在春节前，出现了历史上没有过的繁荣景象。这里每天都接待着成百上千选购“年货”的农民、农村小贩和县供销社的业务员；最近一个多月，销售的商品在六百万元以上，差不多快抵上百货大楼一个月的销货额了，比平常增加了好几倍，其中有一多半运销到河北、山西等省广大农村去了。在数不清的一排排货台上，堆满了农民喜爱的发网、绒头绳、童帽、鞋花、发夹、印花手绢、年画和小圆镜等商品，五光十色，好像是一幅美丽的彩色图画。这些商品常常是刚摆出来就卖光了。八个制帽生产合作社一个来月生产的三万打童帽，几乎就这样的全部销到农村。春节前上市的一万多打印花手绢，上面用不同彩色印着“梁山伯与祝英台”“牛郎织女”等故事画，特别受到农民欢迎，真是供不应求。姑娘用的各色绒头绳和鞋花，近来也大量销到农村。农民对这个市场今年春节供应的商品种类、花色和质量，普遍感到满意。在京郊的农村里
    在首都郊区的农村里，热闹的春节庙会和集市纷纷出现了，农民熙熙攘攘忙着赶集买年货。分布在各乡的一千多个合作社分销处，已经把准备好的红糖、肉食、写对联用的红纸、年画等年货，供应到农民手里了，其中光年画就有二十多万张。在南苑区偏僻的鹿圈村，春节前，老年人组成的清洁队把全村街道打扫得干干净净。挂满年画的中心商店，每天简直像变成了儿童世界，有的在帮助妈妈买东西，有的就在货柜前不停地跳呀唱起来。四、五天来，这个店每天的销货额都在一千元以上，比平常增加一倍多。过去这里很少供应花布，这次新添了十几匹，很吸引人。一个叫贾桂芝的女社员，高兴地在节前买了一丈花哔叽，准备给两个孩子赶制新衣过节。店里的两部流动售货车，整日在附近的小村里流动，出售各种副食品、棉布、日用百货和其他过节用的商品。全村几乎家家户户都挂上了新买的年画。老年人特别喜欢刘胡兰、黄继光的英雄像，高高地挂在屋中央，仔细地看了又看。年轻的女社员崔秀英这些天好像比谁都高兴，一见人就笑得合不拢嘴，原来她要在春节结婚了。六十多岁的妈妈只有这一个闺女，老早就想到镇上给她多买些东西，可女儿不答应，说：大家事事都在节约，结婚虽是大事，也不能多花钱。既这样，妈妈也就不愿和女儿闹别扭，好在本村商店里啥货都准备得很全，很快就把嫁妆置备齐了。妈妈还特别买了三斤肉，十多斤面，准备招待亲朋。
    人们在欢笑着迎接春天——为新的大丰收作准备的又一个春天。
