On the Humanities and Language Research of Ethnic Minorities in the People's Republic of China
    Chinese Academy of Sciences, Linguistics Advisor of the Central Institute for Nationalities, Ge·Bi·Xie·Er·Jiu·Qin·Ke

(I)

China is a multi-ethnic country. It has dozens of ethnic minorities who speak various languages and have many different characteristics in terms of socio-economic development, culture, customs, and religious beliefs. These ethnic minorities are now actively participating, along with the Han people, in the socialist construction of their great motherland and consolidating its national defense.

Whether in China, the Soviet Union, or other countries, the general readership hopes to obtain accurate and scientifically verified reports on the ethnic composition of the residents of the People's Republic of China, their numbers, distribution locations, production activities, and material and spiritual culture. This is entirely understandable. However, it is regrettable that, to date, this perfectly reasonable hope has not been satisfied. Works on the humanities and linguistics of China's ethnic minorities are still very scarce, and many of the published works contain errors and shortcomings.

Now, in elucidating the humanities and language issues related to the new China, it is certainly no longer possible to rely on the works of the humanities and linguistics of old China. Moreover, it should also be considered that, whether it was the Qing Dynasty rulers, the Beiyang warlords or other warlords who replaced them, or the Kuomintang reactionaries who seized power in China in 1927, in implementing a policy of forced assimilation of China's ethnic minorities, they actually denied the fact that China had many independent nationalities that were distinct in history, culture, life, and language. Chiang Kai-shek, in his counter-revolutionary book "China's Destiny," absurdly referred to all ethnic groups living in China, except for the Han, as "clans." The Kuomintang reactionaries' "theory" on the national question was formed on such concepts.

As for how the Chiang Kai-shek clique actually resolved the national question, as is well known, it was no different from the appalling policies of oppression and exploitation implemented by the ruling groups of the Qing Dynasty and the Beiyang warlord era against China's various ethnic minorities.

The bankrupt rulers of old China, since they implemented such a reactionary policy, naturally did not think that much serious research was needed on China's ethnic minorities, their history, culture, life, and language. Therefore, with very few exceptions, we cannot find informative works on the humanities and linguistics of ethnic minorities in the pre-liberation writings in China. These scientific departments were not developed in old China.

Now, in describing the nationalities and languages of the People's Republic of China, the works of Western European and American authors can only be used critically, because these works do not reflect the current situation of these nationalities and languages, do not take into account the tremendous changes that have taken place in the lives of the people of all ethnic minorities in the People's Republic of China and in the development of their languages in recent years, and cannot take into account the new materials on the humanities and languages of China, because most of these materials have been accumulated in the years since the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Of course, some past reports on China's ethnic minorities were still useful to some extent at the time. These reports were compiled based on the works of different authors and were published in the "Encyclopedia Sinica" published in Shanghai in 1917. To some extent, useful materials on various languages of China can also be found in the summary articles by Maspero and other scholars, which were edited into "Les Langues du Monde" published in Paris in 1952. However, these articles also talk more about yesterday's situation than today's, for example, when talking about the languages of southern and southwestern China.

(II)

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China are realizing a national policy based on Marxist-Leninist principles throughout the country, and at the same time, they are encouraging the development of humanities and language research in China in many ways.

As early as the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in 1945, Comrade Mao Zedong instructed: "Their (ethnic minorities - author's note) languages, scripts, customs, habits, and religious beliefs should be respected." In the years after liberation, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government have repeatedly issued instructions on helping ethnic minorities who do not yet have their own written languages to create them, and helping ethnic minorities whose written languages are not yet perfect to reform them.

At the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, in the speeches of Comrade Liu Shaoqi and Comrade Zhou Enlai, as well as many other representatives, and also in the resolutions passed by the congress, the necessity of actively and comprehensively helping China's ethnic minorities was once again emphasized, including the necessity of helping them develop their languages and scripts.

In recent years, based on the decisions of the Party and the government, People's China has launched large-scale and in-depth research on the languages of China's ethnic minorities, and since 1956, it has also begun to study the lifestyles of ethnic minorities in all aspects, and to study their history and culture. It is enough to point out that in 1956 alone, seven large ethnic survey teams and seven larger language survey teams were working in areas inhabited by China's ethnic minorities to illustrate the issue.

The task of the ethnic survey teams organized by the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China is to collect materials on the history, life, culture, and socio-economic structures of ethnic minorities living in Northeast China, Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong, Yunnan, Sichuan, Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia.

The ethnic minority language survey teams organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Central Institute for Nationalities are now studying the languages and dialects of the Tibetan language family, the languages of the Mongolian language family (including the Tu, Dongxiang, and Bonan languages, which have not been studied until now and are only found in the People's Republic of China), the languages of the Turkic language family in Xinjiang and other languages, the unique languages of the Miao-Yao language family, the languages in Yunnan with various different structures, and also the Zhuang, Dong, and Shui languages (Guangxi, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Yunnan provinces), as well as the Li language of Hainan Island. Research on the languages of the ethnic groups in the mountainous areas of Taiwan, the so-called "Gaoshan" languages, has also begun among some Gaoshan people who now live on the Chinese mainland.

In the years after liberation, the work of studying the languages of various ethnic groups in China has advanced significantly. The study of specific languages and language families is progressing more and more each year. The research methods themselves are becoming clearer and more perfect, the number of languages studied is increasing, and the language research itself is gradually becoming more in-depth and more comprehensive.

At present, the rapid pace of scientific research on the languages of ethnic minorities in the People's Republic of China can be demonstrated by the following fact. In March 1954, the "Chinese Language and Writing" magazine published an article on the general situation of the languages and scripts of ethnic minorities in China written by two famous Chinese scientists, Professor Luo Changpei and Professor Fu Maoji. At the same time as the publication of this article, the "Overview Table of Ethnic Minority Languages and Scripts" edited by the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences was also printed.

From the time of publication of the above-mentioned works to the present, it has only been two and a half years, but based on the materials from these two and a half years of investigation and research, it is already possible to make some additions and corrections to the "Overview Table" of the Institute of Linguistics and the articles of Professor Luo Changpei and Professor Fu Maoji. These additions and corrections are related to both the Sino-Tibetan language family and the languages of other language families, including Mongolian and Turkic languages.

The independence of the Jingpo and Zaiwa languages, two very closely related languages of the Tibeto-Burman language family, has now been definitively affirmed. However, in the "Overview Table" of the Institute of Linguistics and the articles of the two scientists mentioned above, the relationship between these two languages is not clearly described. Now, the Zhuang and Buyi languages of Guangxi and Guizhou have been studied quite comprehensively, the boundaries of the dialects and sub-dialects of these two languages have been clarified, and special scientific seminars have been held for these two languages respectively. The meetings expressed their approval of the Zhuang and Buyi language script schemes that could achieve as much consensus as possible. In recent years, the language and script issues of the Dai people in China have also become clear; the two main Dai scripts commonly used in China, Dai Le script (Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture) and Dai Na script (Dehong Dai Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture), have been improved. At present, the study of the main dialects of the Miao language has been completed, and four Miao scripts have been developed. The characteristics of the Li language of Hainan Island have been clarified. In addition, some other issues related to various languages and their language branches and sub-branches – Yi, Mongolian, Mon-Khmer, and other languages – have also been clarified.

Detailed research on the Daur language has provided irrefutable evidence that this language should belong to the Mongolian language family (in the "Overview Table" of the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, it was listed under the Tungusic language branch). Due to the large-scale investigation and research on the Mongolian language in China in 1955 and 1956, some materials were obtained that were sufficient to supplement and correct the reports on the Mongolian language family in international Mongolian studies literature.

Recently, some problems in the dialectology of the Uyghur language in China have also been clarified, the problem of the Tajik language in China has become much clearer, and the situation of some Tungus-Manchu languages and other languages is also clearer than before.

In short, in People's China, the vigorous scientific research work systematically enriches our knowledge of the languages and scripts of ethnic minorities in China. At the same time, it also makes it easier for us to make fairly accurate classifications of these languages.

(III)

However, if Chinese linguists could utilize the research materials of historians and humanists who study China's ethnic minorities in their work, then the detailed and comprehensive study of ethnic minority languages would certainly be able to proceed more easily and achieve greater results. However, it is regrettable that the research work in the humanities and history in the institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Higher Education has been carried out too slowly; there is almost no connection between the work of humanists, historians, and linguists. As far as we know, the plans of the ethnic survey teams and linguistic survey teams in 1956 were not even discussed in detail and coordinated at a joint meeting of historians, humanists, and linguists engaged in the study of China's ethnic minorities.

Only on the basis of the joint work of historians, humanists, and linguists is it possible to make the most accurate classifications of China's nationalities and languages. The problem of the classification of China's nationalities, as well as the problem of the classification of their languages and dialects, has been quite complex until recently. Many ethnic minority languages belonging to different language families and language branches and which diverge greatly in phonology, grammar, and vocabulary are still relatively difficult to study. If detailed historical and humanistic investigations are not conducted on China's ethnic minorities who speak these languages, it will be difficult not only to determine their language classifications, but also to make their ethnic classifications.

Even in our era – the period of socialist construction in People's China – these ethnic minorities still retain many characteristics of the past in their socio-economic structures. Some of them seem to be still in the primitive society stage (the Oroqen people in Northeast China, some of the Va people in Yunnan Province, the Lhoba people in south-central Sichuan, the Gaoshan people in Taiwan); others still preserve quite obvious components characterizing the slave society system in their social development (individual branches of the Yi people in Sichuan, the Jingpo people in Yunnan); and still others seem to be going through different stages of feudal social development (the Yi people in Yunnan and Guizhou, the Dai people in Xishuangbanna Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan, the Tibetan people in Tibet, Qinghai, Sichuan, and other regions, and some ethnic minorities in Xinjiang).

However, when we understand the social development, life, and customs of these ethnic minorities in China, we can more often see a rather complex phenomenon of intermingling between individual characteristics that characterize different socio-economic structures. As some Chinese authors have justly pointed out, in the modern social structure of China's ethnic minorities, "it is difficult to find a typical example of a certain stage of social development" (see Fei Xiaotong, Lin Yaohua: "Research on the Social Nature of Ethnic Minorities," People's Daily, August 14, 1956).

Few of the old researchers paid attention to this extremely complex situation in the social structures of many ethnic minorities in China, and few paid attention to their interrelationships. However, in reality, only after detailed and comprehensive humanistic and historical investigations of China's nationalities, whether large or small, is it possible to truly determine their historical and modern relationships, which to a considerable extent can also explain their historical and modern interrelationships in terms of language.

This type of work by historians and humanists will certainly be of great significance to the experts who study the languages of ethnic minorities in the People's Republic of China. With the help of this type of work, linguists will be more confident in delineating the boundaries of the language and dialect distribution of certain ethnic groups, and will also be more confident and more correct in solving the problem of how many scripts and how many standard languages certain ethnic groups should have.

It is precisely due to the lack of authoritative historical and humanistic materials on the Yi people that the boundaries between Yi dialects are still difficult to determine. According to the materials in 1955, there were forty-three self-designations among the different branches of the Yi people in Yunnan Province alone. The Yi residents of Guizhou Province and Sichuan Province also have some different self-designations. Obviously, these self-designations are the self-identification markers of some clans, tribes, and clan-tribal alliances that existed at different times and even still exist today among the Yi people. The origin of these names should be analyzed from the historical relationships of the various branches of the Yi people, first of all by historians and humanists. Their joint cooperation with linguists will provide a reliable basis for solving humanistic and historical problems and elucidating linguistic problems.

The Hani people in Yunnan Province have twenty-three self-designations, which also illustrates that the clan-tribal composition of the Hani people is very complex. Due to the lack of reliable materials on this ethnic group, difficulties have been created for the work of linguists. At present, linguists are forced not only to analyze language relationships themselves, but also to analyze the humanistic relationships existing within this ethnic group.

Due to the lack of reliable humanistic and historical materials on the Miao-Yao ethnic group, it is still difficult to determine the language boundaries and dialect boundaries of these ethnic groups.

Correctly dividing nationalities and languages is extremely important for linguists engaged in creating and reforming ethnic minority scripts. Scientists should promote the natural union of tribes into ethnic groups when carrying out this work among those ethnic minorities in China that are relatively backward in development, and help the forgotten and oppressed ethnic minorities of the past to develop.

When creating new scripts or reforming old scripts for a certain ethnic group, and when determining the basic dialect and standard pronunciation of a unified national standard language, linguists should help the entire ethnic group to create and develop scripts and standard languages. They (the scientists) should not only start from individual tribes, because these tribes, under the conditions of a country developing towards socialism, are historically uniting into larger social wholes in accordance with historical laws. In linguistic work, it is necessary to take into account the trends of social development, and to use unified scripts and standard languages to promote and form this historically inevitable and completely lawful process. It would be unreasonable to cut the development of the languages of those ethnic groups that have lagged behind in their development due to poor historical conditions into overly fragmented pieces, and to divide their language commonalities too dispersedly. If this is done, it will be no different from the old, handicraft-style working methods adopted by some European missionaries who created scripts for ethnic minorities in southern China.

Here are two examples of past working methods that can illustrate the handicraft-style working method. To date, the Lisu people in Yunnan still use three scripts: one is the old square script currently used among a small number of residents, and the other two were created by missionaries and are mainly used among Lisu Christians and during worship services. The most commonly used of these scripts is the one created by missionaries, which consists of upright and inverted uppercase Latin letters. The second script created by the missionaries was formulated according to the system of Pollard, which was originally created for the Miao people in Sichuan and Yunnan, and it is completely different from modern alphabet systems. Pollard's script has no cursive script, cannot correctly express the phonetic composition of the language, is imperfect in terms of letter forms and education, and is difficult to master.

All three of these scripts exist only formally among the Lisu people, and have no prestige among the masses of residents. They are unreasonable in terms of education, phonetics, and letter forms. The creation of these scripts did not take into account the task of completing mass education, did not intend to be universally used among all Lisu people, but only took care of individual sub-dialects and some residents, artificially divided the Lisu people into three parts, and created disharmony, and sometimes even hostile relations, between these several parts of the residents.

In view of the historical lessons of creating three scripts for a unified Lisu ethnic group, in 1955 we suggested creating a new, unified script for the entire Lisu ethnic group, which should be such a script: it should be more reasonable in terms of phonetics, letter forms, and education, especially with its help, the Lisu ethnic group should be united and consolidated into a unified whole. Now, the plan for this new script has been formulated.

The second example. The Dai people in Yunnan Province are divided into two parts in terms of language (dialects) – Dai Le and Dai Na. However, due to different historical conditions, there have long been four scripts commonly used among the Dai people in China: Dai Le, Dai Na, Dai Beng, and Jinping, and tracing their origins, they all come from the Pali script of India. It is certainly unreasonable that there are four Dai scripts in Yunnan Dai residents with only two dialect areas. And the fifth script based on phonetic symbols created by a certain missionary for the Dai residents of Xinping County is, of course, completely unfounded.

Therefore, it should be recognized that the resolution passed at the symposium on Dai scripts held in Kunming in the autumn of 1955 – to retain only two scripts, Dai Le and Dai Na, among the Dai residents of the People's Republic of China, in order to adapt to the two main dialect areas of the Dai people in Yunnan – is completely correct.

The interrelationships between the various parts of the Dai people in the People's Republic of China were determined by Chinese linguists themselves. Here, there may be some issues that they have not considered. It would certainly be better if the Dai issue were solved jointly by historians, humanists, and linguists.

The humanistic, historical, and linguistic investigation and research of the ethnic minorities of the People's Republic of China still needs to be carried out for a long time. This investigation and research should promote the economic and cultural development of the ethnic minority areas of China as much as possible. If close and frequent contacts can be established between Chinese historians, humanists, and linguists, then this important scientific research work will achieve greater results.

Only under these conditions will the experts in Chinese social sciences be able to quickly and effectively complete the tasks assigned to them by the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

The Institute of Languages and Scripts of Ethnic Minorities in China was established at the end of 1956 by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It would be very reasonable to establish a humanistic center – the Institute of Humanities – as quickly as possible within the system of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, under which a large national humanities museum could also be organized.

These two institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, working in coordination with each other, will and will certainly maximize the rapid and comprehensive upsurge of the cultures of China's ethnic minorities.

As a Soviet scholar who has seen the flourishing of science in People's China for more than two years, I would like to wish my Chinese colleagues quick and greater achievements in completing the tasks assigned to them by the Communist Party of China.

    论中华人民共和国少数民族的人文和语言研究
    中国科学院  中央民族学院语言学顾问　格·彼·谢尔久琴柯
    （一）
    中国是一个多民族的国家。它拥有数十个操各种不同语言，并在社会经济发展、文化、风俗习惯和宗教信仰等方面有许多不同特点的少数民族。这些少数民族现在正和汉族人民一起积极参加自己伟大祖国的社会主义建设，巩固它的国防力量。
    不论是中国、苏联或其他国家的广大读者都很希望能够得到有关中华人民共和国居民的民族成分，他们的数字、分布地点、生产活动、物质和精神文化方面的一些准确的和经过科学检验的报道。这是完全可以理解的。但是，十分遗憾的是，到目前为止，这个完全合理的希望还没有得到满足。有关中国各少数民族的人文学和语言学方面的著作目前还很贫乏，而在已经发表的著作中则有不少错误和缺点。
    现在，在阐明有关新中国的人文和语言问题时，当然已经不能依靠旧中国的人文学和语言学的著作了。何况，还应该考虑到，不论是清朝统治者也好，不论是代替了他们的北洋军阀或其他军阀也好，不论是1927年在中国夺取了政权的国民党反动派也好，他们在对中国各少数民族实行强制同化政策时，实际上是否认了中国有许多在历史、文化、生活和语言方面各不相同的独立民族这一事实。蒋介石在他所写的那本反革命的“中国之命运”一书中把所有居住在中国的民族，除去汉族以外，都荒谬地称为“宗族”。国民党反动派关于民族问题的“理论”也就是在类似这样的概念上形成的。
    至于蒋介石分子如何在实际上解决民族问题，则如众所周知的那样，是同清朝和北洋军阀执政时期的统治集团对中国各个少数民族所实行的那种骇人听闻的压迫和剥削政策完全没有什么两样的。
    破了产的旧中国统治者，既然执行着如此反动的政策，自然不会认为对中国各少数民族，对他们的历史、文化、生活和语言还需要进行多少认真的研究。因此，除去极少数例外，我们在中国解放前的著作中找不到有关少数民族人文学和语言学方面的富有内容的作品。这些科学部门在旧中国本来就是没有得到发展的。
    现在在描写中华人民共和国的民族和语言时，对西欧和美国作者的著作也只能批判地利用，因为这些著作没有反映出这些民族和语言的现状，没有估计到近几年来，在中华人民共和国各少数民族人民生活中，在他们语言的发展中所发生的那些巨大变化，也不可能考虑到那些有关中国的人文和语言的新材料，因为这些材料的绝大部分都是在中华人民共和国成立以后的年代中积累起来的。
    当然，过去一些有关中国少数民族的报道，当时在某种程度上还是有用的，这些报道是根据不同作者的著作编成的，曾发表在1917年上海出版的“中国百科全书（Encyclopedia Sinica）”里。有关中国各种语言的在某种程度上说是有益的材料，也可以在马伯乐和其他学者的总结性文章中找到，这些文章被编辑在1952年巴黎出版的“世界的语言（Les Langues du Monde）”中。但是，这些文章也都是谈昨天的情况比谈今天的情况来得多，例如在谈中国南部和西南部的语言时就是这样。
    （二）
    中国共产党中央委员会和中华人民共和国中央人民政府在全国实现着建立在马克思列宁主义原则上的民族政策，与此同时并多方鼓励在中国发展人文和语言的研究工作。
    还在1945年所举行的中国共产党第七次代表大会上，毛泽东同志就指示说：“他们（少数民族——作者注）的言语、文字、风俗、习惯和宗教信仰，应被尊重。”在解放后的几年中，中国共产党中央委员会和中央人民政府曾不止一次地作出了关于帮助那些还没有自己文字的少数民族创立文字以及帮助那些文字还不完善的民族改革文字的指示。
    在中国共产党第八次全国代表大会上，在刘少奇同志和周恩来同志以及许多其他代表的发言中，同样还在大会通过的决议中，重又强调了积极和全面帮助中国各少数民族的必要性，其中包括帮助发展他们的语言和文字的必要性。
    近年来，人民中国在党和政府决议的基础上展开了大规模的和深入的研究中国各少数民族语言的工作，从1956年起还开始了从各方面研究少数民族的生活习惯，研究他们的历史和文化的工作。只要指出只是1956年就有七个大的民族调查队和七个更大的语言调查队在中国各少数民族居住地区工作着这一事实，就足以说明问题了。
    由中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会民族委员会所组织的民族调查队的任务，是收集居住在东北、贵州、广西、广东、云南、四川、西藏、新疆及内蒙古的少数民族的历史、生活、文化和社会经济结构的材料。
    由中国科学院和中央民族学院所组织的少数民族语言调查工作队，现在正研究藏语支的语言及其方言，蒙古语族的语言（包括到现在为止还没有被研究过而且只中华人民共和国才有的土族语、东乡语和保安语），新疆突厥语族的语言及其他语言，正在研究独特的苗瑶语族的语言，云南的那些具有各种不同结构的语言，同样还在研究僮、侗、水诸语言（广西、贵州、广东、云南诸省），以及海南岛的黎语。对台湾山区的民族的语言，所谓“高山”语的研究工作，也已经在现居中国大陆上的一些高山族人中间开始进行。
    在解放后的年代里，研究中国各个不同民族的语言的工作，显著地向前推进了。对各个具体语言和语族的研究，一年比一年有更大的进展。各种不同语言的研究法本身也在日益趋向明确和完善，所研究的语言的数量日渐加多，语言研究的本身也逐渐更深入和更全面。
    目前，中华人民共和国少数民族语言科学研究工作前进速度之快，可以由以下事实证明。1954年3月，在“中国语文”杂志上发表了中国两位有名的科学家罗常培教授和傅懋绩教授所写的一篇关于中国少数民族语言文字概况的文章。和发表这篇文章的同时，还印出了由中国科学院语言研究所编辑的“民族语文概况表”。
    从上面所提到的著作发表的时间算起，到现在一共才不过两年半，但根据这两年半调查研究的材料，已经可以对语言研究所的“概况表”和罗常培及傅懋绩两教授的文章作一些补充和订正了。这些补充和订正既和汉藏语系语言有关，也和其他语系的语言，包括蒙语诸语言和突厥语诸语言有关。
    藏缅语族的两种彼此十分接近的语言——景颇语和载佤语之间的某种独立性，现在已经确切地肯定了。但在语言研究所的“概况表”和上面提到的两位科学家的文章里，这两种语言的相互关系是介绍得很不清楚的。现在，广西和贵州的僮语和布依语已经研究得相当全面，这两种语言的方言和土语的界限已经明确，为这两种语言分别召开过专门的科学讨论会。会议上对尽可能取得一致的僮语和布依语文字方案表示了赞同。近年来，中国傣族的语言文字问题也清楚了；对中国通用的两种主要傣文——傣仂文（西双版纳傣族自治州）和傣?文（德宏傣族景颇族自治州），已经予以改进。目前，苗语主要方言的研究已经结束，并已制定了四种苗文。海南岛黎语的特点已经阐明。此外还弄清楚了其他一些与各种语言及其语支和次语支——彝语、蒙语、孟高棉语及其他语言有关的问题。
    对达呼尔语的详细研究，提供了不可反驳的证据，证明这种语言应属于蒙古语族（在中国科学院语言研究所的“概况表”里，它曾被列入通古斯语支）。由于1955和1956两年对中国蒙语进行了大规模的调查研究，因而获得了一些足以补充和订正国际间蒙古学文献中那些有关蒙古语族的报道材料。
    近来，中国维吾尔语方言学中的一些问题也得到了阐明，中国的塔吉克语问题变得清楚多了，某些通古斯满语和其他语言的情况也比以前更明确了。
    总之，在人民中国，蓬勃开展着的科学研究工作，系统地丰富了我们在中国各少数民族语言文字方面的知识。同时，还使我们易于对这些语言作出相当正确的分类。
    （三）
    但是，如果中国的语言学家在自己的工作中能够利用那些研究中国各少数民族的历史学家和人文学家的研究材料，那么，详细而全面的研究少数民族语言的工作一定能够进行得比较容易，并能得到更大成绩。然而遗憾的是，中国科学院和高等教育部各个机构中的人文历史方面的研究工作开展得太慢了；在人文学家、历史学家和语言学家的工作中几乎看不到联系。据我们所知，1956年民族调查队和语言学调查队的计划，都甚至于没有在从事研究中国少数民族的历史学家、人文学家和语言学家的共同会议上详细地讨论和取得相互配合。
    只有在历史学家、人文学家和语言学家共同工作的基础上，才有可能最正确地作出中国的民族和语言的分类。中国各民族分类问题，同样还有他们的语言和方言分类问题，直到最近还相当复杂。很多属于不同语系和语族并且在语音、语法和词汇方面分歧很大的少数民族语言，现在还比较难于研究。如果对操这些语言的中国各少数民族不作详细的历史人文调查，不仅很难确定他们的语言分类，而且也很难作出他们的民族分类。
    甚至在我们的时代——人民中国社会主义建设时期，这些少数民族在自己的社会经济结构中还保留着不少过去的特征。他们之中有一些好像还处在原始社会阶段（中国东北的鄂伦春人、云南省的一部分佧佤人、四川中南部的珞瑜人、台湾的高山人）；另外一些在自己的社会发展中还保存着相当明显地表征着奴隶社会制度的成份（四川彝族的个别支系、云南的景颇族）；还有一些则好像还在经历着封建社会发展的不同阶段（云南和贵州的彝族、云南西双版纳自治州的傣族，西藏、青海、四川及其他地区的藏族，新疆的某些少数民族）。
    但是，我们在了解中国的这些或那些少数民族的社会发展、生活和习惯的时候，更经常地可以在他们那里看到，在表征着不同社会经济结构的个别特点之间有一种相当复杂的错综现象。如同某些中国作者所公正地指出的那样，在中国少数民族的现代社会结构中“很难找到某一个社会发展阶段的典型例子”（见费孝通、林耀华：“关于少数民族社会性质的研究”，1956年8月14日人民日报）。
    在旧的研究工作者中，很少有谁注意到中国很多少数民族社会结构中的这种极其复杂的情况，很少有谁注意到他们彼此之间的相互关系。然而实际上，只有在对中国的不论是人多或人少的民族进行了详细而全面的人文历史调查之后，才有可能真正确定他们之间的历史的和现代的关系，这些关系在相当大的程度上也能说明他们语言方面的历史的和现代的相互关系。
    历史学家和人文学家的这类著作对研究中华人民共和国少数民族语言的专家们来说，一定能有很大意义。语言学家借助于这类著作就会更有信心地来划分某些民族的语言和方言分布的界限，也会更有信心、更正确地来解决某些民族应有几种文字和几种标准语的问题。
    正是由于缺少关于彝族的这种历史和人文方面的权威性的材料，彝语方言间的界限至今难于确定。根据1955年的材料，只是在云南省的不同支系的彝族就有四十三种自称。贵州省和四川省的彝族居民同样也有一些不同的自称。显然，这些自称是在不同时期，而且甚至在今天还存在于彝族中的一些氏族、部落和氏族部落联盟的自我标记。应当从彝族各个支系的历史关系中分析这些名称的来源的，首先是历史学家和人文学家。他们和语言学家的共同合作，将能对解决人文历史问题和阐明语言学问题提供可靠的基础。
    云南省的哈尼族有二十三个自称，这些自称同样说明了哈尼族的氏族部落组成是很复杂的。由于缺少有关这个民族的切实可信的材料，以致给语言学家的工作造成了困难，目前语言学家们被迫不仅要亲自分析语言的关系，而且还要分析存在于这个民族中的人文关系。
    由于缺少有关苗瑶族的切实可信的人文历史材料，因而至今还难于确定这些民族的语言界限和方言界限。
    正确地划分民族和语言，对从事创立和改革少数民族文字的语言学家来说，是极其重要的。科学家们在中国那些发展上比较落后的少数民族当中进行这一工作时，应当促进部落自然地联合为部族，帮助过去被遗忘的和被压迫的少数民族得到发展。
    在为某一民族创立新文字或是改革旧文字以及在确定统一的全民标准语的基础方言和标准音时，语言学家应当帮助整个的民族来创立和发展文字及标准语。他们（科学家们）不应该只从个别的部落出发，因为处在向社会主义发展的国家的条件下的这些部落，正合乎历史规律地统一为较大的社会整体。在语言学工作中必须考虑到社会发展的趋向，并且要借助统一的文字和标准语来促使这个历史上必然的、完全合乎规律的过程加速进行和形成。把那些由于历史条件不好，以致在自己的发展上落后了的民族的语言的发展切得过于零碎，把他们的语言共同性分得过于零散都将是不合理的。如果这样做，那就会同某些为中国南部的少数民族创立过文字的欧洲传教士所采用过的那种旧的、手工业式的工作方法没有区别了。
    这里举两个过去曾采用过的可以说明手工业式工作方法的例子。到目前为止，云南的傈僳族还使用着三种文字：一种是目前还在人口不多的居民中使用的旧方块字，另外两种是由传教士所创制的，主要在傈僳族基督教徒间及做礼拜时使用。这几种文字中最常使用的是传教士创制的那种由正的和倒的大写拉丁字母组成的文字。传教士造的第二种文字是按照柏格理的那个体系所制定的，这种文字最初是为四川和云南的苗族创制的，它和现代的字母系统完全不同。柏格理的文字没有草体，不能正确地表达语言的语音组成，从字母形式和教育学方面讲都不完善，并且很难掌握。
    所有这三种文字在傈僳族中只是形式地存在，在居民群众中并没有威信。它们在教育学、语音学和字母形式方面都是不合理的。这些文字的创制，没有考虑到要完成群众教育的任务，没有打算在全体傈僳族中普遍使用，而只是照顾了个别的土语和某些居民，它们把傈僳族人为地分成了三部分，并且造成了这几部分居民之间的不和睦的，有时甚至是敌对的关系。
    有鉴于为统一的傈僳族创立了三种文字的历史教训，我们在1955年曾建议为全傈僳族创立一种新的、统一的文字，这种文字应该是这样一种文字：在语音学、字母形式和教育学方面应当是较为合理的，特别是借助它应能把傈僳族联合和团结为统一的整体。现在，这种新文字的方案已经制定出来了。
    第二个例子。云南省的傣族在语言（方言）方面分为两部分——傣仂和傣?。但是，由于不同的历史条件，在中国的傣族中很早就通用着四种文字：傣仂，傣?，傣绷和金平，追溯它们的来源，则都是来自印度的巴利文。在只有两个方言区的云南傣族居民中，存在着四种傣文，这当然是没有什么理由的。而由某个传教士为新平县的傣族居民所创立的那种以注音字母为基础的第五种文字，当然更是完全没有依据的。
    因此，应该承认，1955年秋天在昆明召开的傣文问题讨论会上所通过的决议——在中华人民共和国的傣族居民中只保留两种文字，傣仂文和傣?文，以适应云南傣族的两个主要方言区——是完全正确的。
    中华人民共和国傣族各个部分之间的相互关系，是由中国语言学家自己确定的。这里，他们可能有些问题还没有考虑到。如果傣族问题是由历史学家、人文学家和语言学家共同解决的话，那当然会解决得更好。
    中华人民共和国各少数民族的人文历史和语言的调查研究，还需要进行很长时间。这一调查研究应当尽可能地促进中国少数民族地区经济和文化的发展。如果中国的历史学家、人文学家和语言学家之间能建立起紧密的和经常的接触，那末，这一重要的科学研究工作将取得更大的成绩。
    只有在这种条件下，中国社会科学的专家们才有可能迅速和有效地完成中国共产党第八次全国代表大会给他们提出的任务。
    中国科学院在1956年底已经成立了研究中国少数民族语言文字的研究所。在中国科学院系统里，尽可能迅速地成立人文学中心——人文研究所，那将是很合理的，在这个所的下面还可以组织全国性的大的人文博物馆。
    中国科学院的这两个研究所，在相互配合工作的条件下将会而且也一定会最大限度地促进中国各少数民族文化的迅速和全面的高涨。
    我，作为一个两年多来在人民中国看到科学蓬勃发展的苏联学者，愿祝我的中国同事们在完成中国共产党所交给他们的任务时，能取得迅速的更大的成就。
