One of the ills in the production management work of some enterprises is that there are too many non-production personnel, and many people are idle and panic-stricken.

In the Northwest, there is an engineering company with a total of 439 cadres of all levels, while there are only over 900 workers. On average, there is one cadre for every two workers. People say that this company is a "cadre company." In fact, its original name was "Northwest Building Structure Installation Company."

The Wuxi Wantai Bleaching Powder Factory has a total of 26 employees, of whom 15 are non-production personnel. People criticize this factory for putting on a big show with a small factory.

The larger the production management organization, the more production management costs increase, and the corresponding production costs will increase accordingly. The efficiency of production management is bound to decrease, and the problems of detachment from the masses and bureaucracy will also arise. The solution is to streamline the upper-level organizations and strengthen the lower-level organizations; or streamline the upper-level organizations and strengthen production forces. Recently, the Jingdezhen Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China called on 1,000 technical cadres familiar with ceramic production to return to production posts to create wealth for the country. Many people responded to this call and signed up enthusiastically. This is a very good example.

Some people doubt whether drawing personnel from upper-level organs to lower-level organizations will make the lower-level organizations larger. Judging from the facts in Jingdezhen, this doubt does not exist. The problem is that streamlining the organization is not a simple transfer of jobs, but a scientific arrangement of production forces from the perspective of developing production. If some units in the past have drawn too many technically skilled workers from production posts to take on production management work, thereby weakening the production team, then today we must be determined to draw out a part of these people to return to production posts as production backbones, to further improve and enhance production. Doing so is beneficial to both the whole and the individual. According to social needs and possibilities, our production cause must continue to develop. However, developing production does not mean blindly expanding production management organizations. Some people do not understand this point and mechanically apply some so-called modern management systems, resulting in documents circulating endlessly, things being pushed back and forth, and problems still piling up.

Of course, to rectify a once quite large production management organization into a streamlined and highly efficient organization, and to arrange for the transferred personnel appropriately, is not a simple matter. This requires a cautious attitude and meticulous ideological work, first to focus everyone's attention on the goal of doing a good job in production, and to be willing to return to production posts, and then for the leadership to carefully study and make unified arrangements so that those who are transferred from the management organs can all be in the right place and give full play to their strengths.

    回到生产岗位上去
    舟山
    有些企业在生产管理工作上的病害之一，就是非生产人员过多，不少人闲得发慌。
    西北有个工程公司，大小干部共有四百三十九人，而工人只有九百多人。平均每两个工人就有一个干部。人们说这个公司是“干部公司”。其实，它原有的名字叫做“西北建筑结构安装公司”。
    无锡市万泰漂粉厂全体职工共有二十六人，而非生产人员占到十五人。人们批评这个工厂说：小厂也摆大摊子。
    生产管理机构愈庞大，生产管理费用就愈多，生产成本就要相应地提高，而生产管理效率就不免要降低，脱离群众、官僚主义的毛病也就因此滋生。解决的办法，一是紧缩上层机构，充实下层组织；一是紧缩上层机构，充实生产力量。最近，中共景德镇市委会号召一千名熟悉陶瓷生产的技术干部回到生产岗位上去，为国家创造财富，许多人响应了这个号召，纷纷申请报名，这是一件很好的事例。
    有人怀疑：上层机关抽调人员到下层去，会不会使下层机构庞大起来呢？从景德镇的事实看来，这个怀疑是不存在的。问题在于，精简机构不是工作岗位的简单转移，而是要从发展生产着眼，科学地安排生产力量。如果有些单位在过去从生产岗位上过多地抽出了技术较高的工人担任生产管理工作，而削弱了生产队伍，那么今天就要下决心抽出一部分人重新回到生产岗位上去，作为生产骨干，进一步改进和提高生产。这样做，对于整体和个人都是有利的。根据社会需要和可能，我们的生产事业是要不断发展的，但是，发展生产并不等于盲目地扩大生产管理机构。有些人不了解这一点，机械地搬用什么现代化管理制度，结果公文团团转，事情推来推去，问题还是一大堆。
    当然，要把一个原来相当庞大的生产管理机构整顿成为一个精干的具有较高效率的机构，并且把抽调出来的人安排得适当，并不是一件简单的事。这就需要采取慎重的态度，进行细致的思想工作，先使大家的注意力集中到搞好生产的这一目标上去，愿意回到生产岗位，然后由领导方面仔细研究，统一安排，使调离管理机关的人都能各得其所，发挥所长。
