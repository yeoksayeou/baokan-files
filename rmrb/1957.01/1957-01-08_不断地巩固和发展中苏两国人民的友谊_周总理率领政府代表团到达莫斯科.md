As we set foot on the land of the great Soviet Union, I would like to first extend warm and fraternal greetings to the great Soviet people in the name of the Chinese government and the Chinese people.

The great Soviet Union is the first socialist country in human history to open up a new era. Under the leadership of the glorious Soviet Communist Party, the great Soviet people have achieved tremendous economic and cultural achievements under extremely difficult conditions. For forty years, you have been advancing towards the glorious road of communism with unyielding spirit. Your achievements embody the hope of mankind.

The Chinese people have achieved revolutionary victory along the path of the October Revolution. In the cause of striving for their own liberation and building socialism, the Chinese people have received sincere support and generous assistance from the Soviet Union. The peoples of China and the Soviet Union have formed an eternal, fraternal, and unbreakable friendship. The unity of China and the Soviet Union is not only the greatest interest of our two peoples but also the basic guarantee of world peace.

Recently, I visited five countries in South Asia. I personally witnessed the strong desire of the people of these countries for complete national independence, for peace, for friendship between the peoples of all countries, for building their own countries, and against colonialism. Although the imperialists have not abandoned their activities of aggression and subversion, the imperialists' conspiracies are doomed to failure in the close unity of China and the Soviet Union and all socialist countries, and in the common efforts of all peace-loving forces in the world. The universal desire of the people of all countries for peace and progress cannot be stopped by any force.

I sincerely thank you for the warm welcome you have given us in such cold weather. I congratulate the people of Irkutsk on achieving greater success in the great cause of communist construction.

Long live the eternal, fraternal, and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples!

Long live the great unity of the people of the world!
