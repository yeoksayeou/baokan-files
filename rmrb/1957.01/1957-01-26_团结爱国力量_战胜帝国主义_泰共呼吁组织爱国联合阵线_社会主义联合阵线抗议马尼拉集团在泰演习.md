Xinhua News Agency, January 24th, Bangkok Dispatch: According to Thai newspapers, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand issued a New Year's message to the Thai people on January 1st of this year, calling on all Thai political parties and patriots to unite and form a patriotic united front to defeat the threat of American imperialism to Thailand's independence.

The message listed a series of facts, accusing American imperialism of infringing upon Thailand's sovereignty and preventing Thailand from implementing an independent and autonomous policy. The message believes that the Thai people's ongoing struggle for economic, political, and cultural independence is the correct path. The message demanded that various forces in Thailand must end mutual infighting and that all existing patriotic forces in Thailand can cooperate equally under the banner of the Patriotic United Front to defeat imperialism. The message also called on the ruling Maran Kassila Free Party and the Coup Group to change their foreign and domestic policies.

On the 15th, Nai Thep Chotinuchit, leader of the Thai Economic Party and a member of parliament, expressed support at a press conference for the proposal put forward by the Communist Party of Thailand in this message regarding the establishment of a patriotic united front against imperialism. Nai Thep believes that in the future, the establishment of such a united front is achievable.

The Thai weekly "Fatherland" published an editorial on the 14th, expressing support for the proposal of the Communist Party of Thailand. The editorial said that the Thai people do not dislike communism but are concerned about the current threat to their national sovereignty. What the Thai people need now is national unity in order to strive for freedom and safeguard the honor of their country.

TASS, Bangkok, January 24th: According to the Thai "Liberty Communications," the Socialist United Front, recently formed by the Thai Economic Party, the Socialist Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Hyde Park Movement Party, strongly protested the military exercises of the Manila Treaty Organization that began in Thailand on the 23rd.

The newspaper also reported that these four parties will do their utmost to urge the Thai government to withdraw from the Manila Treaty Organization and demand the withdrawal of American military advisors from the Thai army.

(Editor's note) The leader of the Thai Economic Party is Nai Thep Chotinuchit, former Deputy Minister of Commerce of Thailand. Most of the members are teachers and company employees, advocating acceptance of all countries participating in the United Nations and peaceful coexistence among countries.

The leader of the Socialist Party is Nai Wisit Sripothara, and the members are mainly workers, peasants, and students. This party advocates establishing friendly relations with all countries and opposes Thailand's participation in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The leader of the Social Democratic Party is Nai Suthep Sajakun, who advocates "implementing policies in line with a democratic regime with the King as the head of state."

The leader of the "Hyde Park" Movement Party is Nai Phongthep Chotinuchit, the brother of the leader of the Economic Party. This party advocates implementing a policy of neutrality and peaceful coexistence.

The leader of the ruling Maran Kassila Free Party of Thailand is the current Prime Minister of Thailand, Luang Phibunsongkhram. All members of parliament who support the current Thai government and the entire military and police group participate in this party. The members of another ruling party, the Coup Group, are senior military officers, police officers, and participants in the former "1932 Bloodless Coup." The current Thai cabinet is basically composed of members of this group.
