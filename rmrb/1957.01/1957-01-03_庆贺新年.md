Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 2nd: Chinese People's Volunteer Army officers and soldiers celebrated the New Year together with the Korean people.

On New Year's Day, a lively garden party was held at the location of the Volunteer Army's leading organs. In addition to the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army's directly affiliated organs and troops, and some officers' families, Korean people from nearby residential areas also participated in the garden party. Amidst the deafening sounds of gongs and drums, they performed or watched folk art programs rich in national characteristics.

On New Year's Day, officers and soldiers of a certain Volunteer Army unit stationed in the West Coast area warmly welcomed the Korean farmers' New Year delegation from South Pyongan Province. This unit had helped the local people build the "South Pyongan Irrigation Project" in 1956, bringing them a bumper harvest. Volunteer Army frontline troops stationed in areas such as Shangganling and Ma Liangshan exchanged New Year's greetings, visited each other, and held joint celebrations with their Korean People's Army comrades-in-arms who were guarding the positions side-by-side. Volunteer Army troops stationed in other areas also invited representatives from local governments and people to celebrate together, and sent representatives to pay New Year's visits to local Korean governments and residents.

Personnel from the Korean-Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission also exchanged New Year's greetings.

Today, Volunteer Army officers and soldiers, and representatives of the Korean people, also went to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and Korean People's Army Martyrs' Cemetery to pay their respects and offer sacrifices.

Xinhua News Agency, January 2nd: University students from Beijing and foreign students held a New Year's party at the Beijing Hotel on New Year's Day.

More than six hundred international students from fourteen countries, including Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Vietnam, India, Indonesia, and Egypt, participated in the grand gathering.

At the meeting, Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Higher Education, and Wang Zhaohua, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, congratulated the international students and Chinese students, wishing them greater unity and more consolidated friendship in the new year.

Chinese and foreign students danced together. The Beijing University Students' Dance Troupe and Choir, and international students from Vietnam, Mongolia, India, and Indonesia, gave wonderful song and dance performances.

Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, January 2nd: The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Fujian Front troops and the Railway Corps troops constructing the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway celebrated the New Year together with the local people.

On New Year's Day, officers and soldiers of the duty troops guarding the coastline maintained strict vigilance throughout the day, prepared to strike at any harassing enemy. Where possible, the officers and soldiers unfolded celebrations for the New Year. Some units held group New Year's greetings. Some companies and platoons, carrying letters of appreciation and greetings, beat gongs and drums to offer New Year's greetings to their comrades-in-arms in brotherly companies and to the local government. Many organs and companies also sent representatives to participate in joint celebrations with workers, agricultural cooperative members, and students. The art troupe and soldiers' performance team of the troops stationed on Xiamen Island gave New Year's comfort performances for people from all walks of life.

Officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Railway Corps celebrated the New Year along the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway line, which they had completed a year ahead of schedule. On the morning of New Year's Day, officers and soldiers of the Railway Corps' leading organs jointly held a group New Year's greeting event with representatives from local party and government organs, and people's organizations. Representatives of the Railway Corps' leading organs also visited two advanced agricultural production cooperatives near their station. The members of these two agricultural cooperatives expressed their gratitude for the great support given to them by the officers and soldiers of the Railway Corps' leading organs. Around the New Year, the various units of the Railway Corps invited local cadres and the masses to participate in the film evenings or art evenings held by each unit.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 1st: The people of Chongqing celebrated the New Year in a simple atmosphere.

Today, the weather in Chongqing was sunny, and parks, theaters, and cinemas were very crowded, but the phenomenon of rows of cars parked in front of the entrances was gone. Many agency drivers also took the day off as usual. Responsible persons from many units, such as the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee and the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, collectively took public transportation to participate in group New Year's greetings and to visit the suburbs. All agencies canceled New Year's banquets and potluck dinners.

Because everyone paid attention to not spending too much money during the New Year, savings banks have reversed the usual phenomenon of paying out more than they took in at the end and beginning of the year. On December 31st alone, the savings banks in the central district took in more than twice as many deposits as usual. The savings banks in Wanglongmen, Taipingmen, and Jiefang Road took in more than 8,200 yuan more than usual on that day. The shops and vegetable markets throughout the city prepared a lot of goods and non-staple foods, but sales were normal, and foods such as chicken, fish, and duck were available from morning to night.
