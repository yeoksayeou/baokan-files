    Random Thoughts on Dance Music
    Chen Feng
    Good dance music, whether it is arranged based on a dance design or existing works, or whether the choreographer is inspired by certain musical pieces to create the dance, dance and music should be interdependent and complement each other. When a dance appears on the stage, music is the basis for the dance's expression.
    The simplicity and complexity of the music are only differences in performance form and do not determine its quality for the dance. For example, the Shaanxi folk dance "Lazy Woman Grabbing the Field" has very simple music, but it is very successful; only a few light gongs and drums set off the dance with great vitality.
    The combination of music and dance in "Flower and Youth" also achieves a considerable level of excellence, making people feel infinitely harmonious and intimate. It is not simply pursuing the unity of rhythm or merely a kind of Shaanxi musical color. In the performance, we also heard dance music with similar appearances, lacking personality and the characteristic of being closely related to the dance.
    But "Flower and Youth" makes people feel both affectionate and colorful; sometimes it makes you remember the dance from the music, and sometimes it makes you recall the music from the dance.

                            ＊
    Many people have opinions on the soundtrack of "Bombing the Bunker" by the Beijing Dance School, feeling that it is inappropriate to use an old piece of music, "General's Command," to accompany the dance. I have no objection if you say it is still insufficient and not ideal. But the cooperation between the two (performance and dancer) is not bad, and the character and atmosphere of the whole dance are highlighted in many places.
    This kind of cooperation is that the dancers have digested the music and gained inspiration from it; it is that the performers have grasped the dance and made better support.
                            ＊
    The music of Guangdong's "Hero Dance" is fresh and energetic, and the orchestration is also relatively successful. Unfortunately, this dance is not as ideal as its music.
    Their "Marrying a Bride" has a particularly strong atmosphere of life. Although the dance is very simple, just a wedding scene, some people reportedly think this doesn't count as a dance. I am a layman when it comes to dance and it is difficult to discuss. But the music has made me reluctant to leave (its shortcoming is that it is not coherent enough).
    Other examples, such as "March 3rd," "Bowl Dance," and "Red Flower Dance" (there are reportedly disputes about this dance), each have their own musical characteristics; giving me the impression that they have distinct southern colors and each has its own different characteristics and appearance, and they play a better role in setting off the dance.
                            ＊
    It is said that many people have expressed different views on the musical style of "Mr. Dong Guo" performed by the Beijing Dance School. I have watched this dance three or four times; I am often unconsciously drawn into the plot of the dance. Sometimes I also feel that it would be better if some places were more pure in style, but I always feel that it can still form a whole with the emotions of the dance. This shows that the composer, when designing his music, strongly demanded that the music express the plot. Secondly, the national characteristics of the music

    舞蹈音乐散谈
    陈枫
    好的舞蹈音乐，不管它是根据舞蹈设计或现成品而编曲，还是编舞者从某些乐曲获得启示而作舞。舞蹈和音乐两者应该是相依为命，相得益彰。当一个舞蹈在舞台上出现的时候，音乐便是舞蹈表现的依据。
    乐曲的简单和复杂，只是表现形式上的区别，并不决定它对舞蹈的好坏。像陕西的“懒婆娘抢场”，它的音乐非常简单，却很成功；当中只是那么几声轻巧的锣鼓，就把舞蹈衬托得很有生命。
    “花儿与少年”的音乐同舞蹈的结合，也达到相当的佳境，使人感到无限融洽和亲切。它不是单单追求节拍的合一，或者仅仅是一种陕西的音乐色彩。在会演中，我们也听到面貌仿佛的舞蹈音乐，它们缺乏个性，和舞蹈之间缺少血肉相关的特征。
    而“花儿与少年”却使人感到既情深又富色彩；有时使你从音乐记忆起舞蹈，有时使你从舞蹈追念音乐。
                            ＊
    有不少人对北京舞蹈学校的“炸碉堡”的配音有意见，觉得采用一首旧的乐曲“将军令”来配舞很不适当。如果说它还不足和不够理想，我没有意见。但是两者（演奏和舞者）配合得并不坏，整个舞蹈的性格和气氛，有好些地方还是突现出来的。
    这种合作，是舞者消化了音乐，从音乐获得了启发；是演奏者掌握了舞蹈，作了较好的支持。
                            ＊
    广东的“英歌舞”的音乐新鲜而又有活力，配器也比较成功。可惜这个舞蹈并不像它的音乐那么理想。
    他们的“娶新娘”的生活气息特别浓厚。虽然舞蹈非常简单，只是一段婚礼小景，据说有人认为这不算舞蹈。我对舞蹈是外行，很难论述。但是音乐却曾使我依恋不舍（它的缺点是不够连贯）。
    他如“三月三”、“碗舞”、“红花舞” （据说对这个舞蹈有争论）的音乐各有特点；使我有这样的印象，它们有着鲜明的南国色彩，又各有自己不同的特性与面影，并且较好地对舞蹈起着烘托的作用。
                            ＊
    据说许多人对北京舞蹈学校演出的“东郭先生”的音乐风格表示不同的看法。这个舞蹈，我看过三四次；常常是不知不觉被带到舞蹈的情节里面去了。有时也觉得有些地方在风格上更纯一些，那就更好些，但总感到它和舞蹈的情绪还能构成一个整体。这说明了作曲家在设计他的音乐时，是比较强烈地要求音乐表现情节的。其次，音乐的基调的民族特点有许多地方也还鲜明。
    有此两点好处，并且是一个新的尝试（用新的手法来写舞曲），我想还是值得重视的。
    搞出雷同的东西很方便，抄、剪，或者人云亦云并不费事；要创新可得花点力气。新而有缺点并不奇怪。吸收有益的意见，以便在新的创作中改进，对改变“三灯一跑”的状况可能是有意义的。
                                ＊
    上海的“剑舞”、“男欢女喜”，中央歌舞团的“孔雀”，江苏的“花扇舞”（笛子特别优美、准确），北京舞蹈学校的“炸碉堡”等舞蹈的音乐演奏很认真，认真就体现了舞蹈的深意；就产生美感。
    有些乐队的乐器声音不准，如煤矿文工团的“古典扇舞”中的二胡，北京舞蹈学校的“游春”、西北民族学院的“拉卜楞的节日”等的音乐可能是由于水平的限制，只能当弱点一步步克服。
    有些却是疏忽，像上海的“回旋鼓舞”的鼓点。这种疏忽，常常削弱了艺术的感染力，常常使观众难以安静地进入表演的深处。
    音乐演奏上的准确、优美、认真，本身没有什么目的；它准确地表达了舞蹈的精神，能使舞蹈更加完美感人。可马虎不得。
