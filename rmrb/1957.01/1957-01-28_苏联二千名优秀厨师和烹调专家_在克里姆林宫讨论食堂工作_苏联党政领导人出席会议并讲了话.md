Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 27th: Two thousand outstanding Soviet chefs and culinary experts held a meeting in the Kremlin from January 23rd to 26th to discuss improvements to public dining halls. The meeting was jointly convened by the Soviet commercial departments and the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions.

The meeting examined the shortcomings existing in the work of Soviet public dining halls, such as food that was not delicious in many public dining halls, monotonous daily menus, and excessive waiting times for employees to eat.

Speakers at the meeting put forward many suggestions for improving the work of public dining halls, including continuing to expand the number of public dining halls and implementing a system where customers personally collect and carry their food. This would reduce dining time by two times compared to service by waiters, and the number of diners could be increased accordingly.

The meeting also decided to expand the business of workers taking food home for meals and providing meals for workers' families. Dining in this way can make prices 10% cheaper than dining in the dining hall.

The meeting also discussed the mass production of vegetable washing and cutting machines in order to gradually automate the cooking process, as well as how to reduce lunch prices.

Soviet Communist Party and government leaders Bulganin, Voroshilov, Mikoyan, Molotov, Saburov, Suslov, and Khrushchev attended the closing meeting. Mikoyan spoke at the meeting.

    苏联二千名优秀厨师和烹调专家
    在克里姆林宫讨论食堂工作
    苏联党政领导人出席会议并讲了话
    新华社莫斯科27日电　苏联两千名优秀的厨师和烹调专家从1月23日到26日在克里姆林宫举行会议，讨论改进公共食堂的工作。会议是由苏联商业部门和全苏工会中央理事会联合召集的。
    会议检查了苏联公共食堂工作中存在的缺点，如许多公共食堂食物不鲜美，每天的菜单千篇一律，职工们在食堂等候用饭的时间过长等。
    在会上发言的人提出了许多改进公共食堂工作的建议，其中包括继续扩大公共食堂数量和实行食堂顾客亲自取菜端饭的制度，这样，用饭时间可以比由招待员服务减少两倍，食堂用饭的人数也可以相应增加。
    会议还决定扩大由工人们打饭回家进餐和供应工人家属用餐的业务。用这种方法进餐，可以使价格比在食堂用饭便宜10％。
    会议还讨论了大量生产洗切菜蔬的机器，以便使作饭过程逐步自动化的问题，和如何降低午餐价格的问题等。
    苏联共产党和政府的领导人布尔加宁、伏罗希洛夫、米高扬、莫洛托夫、萨布罗夫、苏斯洛夫、赫鲁晓夫出席了闭幕会议。米高扬在会上讲了话。
