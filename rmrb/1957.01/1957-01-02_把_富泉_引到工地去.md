    Bringing "Fuquan" to the Construction Site

    Snow, like goose down, covered the undulating mountains of Baiyun Ebo. When the wind blows, the swirling snowflakes are like a sea of fog. In this cold season, the spring water of Baiyun Bulag, called "Fuquan" (Rich Spring), gurgles and springs from the eyes of the spring, flowing along the bottom of the water covered with verdant green moss. Severe cold cannot dry it up, and frost cannot freeze it.

    Builders braved the cold, braving the wind and snow, to bring this "Fuquan" water to the construction site.

    As earthwork has just begun, there were not so many skilled workers yet, so everyone enthusiastically participated in the excavation work. Liu Guiqing, who attended the National Advanced Producers Representatives Conference, and his team, from the first shovel of soil, were full of energy. Encouraged by the slogan "Not afraid of the cold weather, use sweat to melt the snow-capped ice," they dug more than five cubic meters of frozen soil per person per day. The howling gale penetrated their old sheepskin coats, and their hands and feet were numb with cold, but they silently swung their picks and shovels, digging the earth. In the evening, back in the tent, in order to prevent frostbite, they gently washed their skin with salt water and chili water. After a night's rest, they went to excavate the frozen soil without complaint the next day.

    The strong worker Wang Zhuwu's team was assigned to the most difficult seamless rock. Here, it was impossible to drive in a pick or insert a drill. With great effort, they could not dig a spoonful of soil at a time. Liu Fuxiang, Wang Zhuwu, Wu Chunlan and others had swollen hands and broke six pick handles. Liu Fuxiang looked at the hard rock and discussed with everyone: "There is nothing difficult. Let's change the method. One person holds the drill, and one person swings the hammer. Can't we still dig it?"

    "Yes," the workers in the team said in unison. After this adjustment, they have now exceeded the quota.

    Severe cold and wind and snow cannot scare them. In the days of heavy snowfall, the sound of workers' shovels and picks still resounded throughout the grassland.

### 把“富泉”引到工地去

    把“富泉”引到工地去
    雪，像鹅绒似的盖着白云鄂博连绵起伏的山岭，一刮风，飘起的雪花像雾海似的。在这寒冷的季节里，白云布拉格的泉水，一股一股跳动着从泉眼里涌出来，沿着长满翠绿色青苔的水底流着，严寒干涸不了它，冰霜冻结不了它。
    建筑者们冒着寒冷，顶着风雪，把这股被称为“富泉”的水引到工地去。
    土方工程刚刚开始，技术工人还没有那么多技工活可做，大家都热火朝天的卷到挖土工程里。出席过全国先进生产者代表会议的刘桂清和他的小组，从第一锹土起就鼓足了劲，在“不怕天寒地冻，用汗水溶化雪山冰河”的口号鼓舞下，一天一个人挖五立方公尺多冻土。呼啸的狂风，吹透了他们的老羊皮上衣，手脚冻得发麻了，大家却一声不响的抡着洋镐，掀着土。晚上，回到帐棚里，为了防止冻伤皮肤，他们就用盐水、辣椒水轻轻地洗一洗，经过一晚的休息，第二天又毫无怨言的去开凿冻土了。
    壮工王铸武小组调到了最困难的无缝岩石上。这里，打不进镐，插不进钎，费九牛二虎的劲，一次挖不下一杓子土来。刘福祥、王铸武、吴春兰等人手都震肿了，还折断了六把镐柄。刘福祥看看坚硬的岩石，跟大伙商量说：“没有什么难的，我们换个方法，一人把钎子，一人抡锤，还开凿不了它呀。”
    “对。”小组工友都异口同声的说。这样调整以后，他们现在已经超过了定额。
    严寒、风雪吓不倒他们，在大雪飞扬的日子里，工地的工友们锹镐声还是响彻了草原。
