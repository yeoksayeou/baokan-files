Xinhua News Agency, January 24th, Cairo dispatch: Egyptian Intelligence Director Hatem stated on the evening of the 22nd that he opposes the "Suez Canal Users Association's" intention to give its member states' ships priority passage through the canal after it is reopened.

Hatem issued a statement following reports that the Suez Canal Users Association was studying the issue of granting its members priority passage through the canal in London. He pointed out that this claim completely violates the Constantinople Convention of 1888, which guarantees free navigation of the canal.

Hatem said that nowhere in the convention does it stipulate that any country's ships can be given priority passage through the canal at the expense of other countries' interests.

    “使用国协会”硬抢不成还想优先通航
    埃及情报司长说：休想！
    新华社24日讯　开罗消息：埃及情报司司长哈特姆22日晚上表示反对“苏伊士运河使用国协会”打算使它的会员国的船只在运河重新开放后能优先通过运河的主张。
    哈特姆发表声明，有消息说运河使用国协会正在伦敦研究给予它的会员国优先通过运河的问题。他指出，这种主张完全违反了1888年签订的关于保证运河自由通航的君士坦丁堡公约。
    哈特姆说，这个公约不论在那一条里都没有规定可以在损害别的国家利益的情况下让任何国家的船只优先通过运河。
