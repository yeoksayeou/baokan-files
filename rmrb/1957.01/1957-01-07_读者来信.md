    Reader's Letters
    The Top Imitates the Bottom; Everyone Does Their Own Thing
    Since January of last year, the Central Architectural Engineering Department's Central-South Regional Administration has newly established five divisions and one industrial enterprise joint company. Many of these units were established unnecessarily and redundantly. Why were they established? Mainly because the Central Architectural Engineering Department lacked serious and unified research and planning for the organizational structure of its affiliated units. The various responsible departments (bureaus) within the ministry simply emphasized the importance of their own system's business, excessively insisting that the organizational structure of affiliated units must "the top imitates the bottom." For example, if the ministry has a department (bureau/division) directly under the minister's leadership, it requires the regional administration to also set up a functional division separately. Before December of the year before last, the regional administration managed capital construction work through a Capital Construction Section. After the establishment of the Capital Construction Department in the ministry, it notified the region that it must strengthen leadership and change the section to a division. Because the ministry's Health Division is directly under the minister's leadership, it was also decided at the health work conference that each region must establish a division. After the Personnel and Education Conference, it was also stipulated that the original Personnel Division should be divided into Personnel and Education two divisions. A few days after the establishment of the Ministry's Transportation Bureau, it sent a telegram to the region instructing that the original Transportation Section should also be changed to a Transportation Division. The accounting conference stipulated that the region should set up an Accounting Division in addition to the original Finance Division...

    Because of the increase and expansion of these organizations, the staffing size inevitably had to be expanded. For example, the Transportation Section, which originally led and managed the overall transportation work, had no more than eighteen people at most. After being changed to a Transportation Division, it has now increased to one hundred and sixty people, and they still say they don't have enough people. The Bureau Enterprise Division, which originally belonged to the administration's three affiliated factories, only had nineteen people. After being changed to an Enterprise Joint Company, it increased to one hundred and three people. According to the manager of this unit, if based on the unit's business, at least fifty more people would need to be added. Other units are also the same.

    After these organizations were increased, work efficiency did not improve, but the levels of official document circulation increased. For example, if the various affiliated factories had something to ask for instructions from the Bureau's Production Enterprise Division, it would take no more than a week. Now, it must first be reported to the Enterprise Joint Company, and then the Joint Company forwards it to the Bureau. After going through the procedures of round-trip approval, printing, receiving, and sending, it takes more than twenty days. Because the organizations are divided too finely, some work is not clearly divided, and you push me, and I push you, kicking the ball back and forth. For example, regarding the issue of cadre study, the Personnel Division says: "Should be managed by the Education Division," and the Education Division says: "Should be managed by the Personnel Division."

    Because there are too many people and too little work, many things that should not be managed are managed, which restricts the enthusiasm of grassroots enterprises. For example, the original three affiliated companies were independent economic accounting units. With the establishment of the Joint Enterprise Company, they became internal accounting units. All plans, finances, production business, internal personnel transfers, etc., must be uniformly balanced, approved, and issued by the company. Therefore, some unit leaders only care about completing tasks, and rarely pay attention to other indicators. The expenses of so many personnel can only be incorporated into the enterprise cost because administrative expenses cannot be reimbursed. For example, the Central-South Iron Rolling Hardware Factory estimated a loss of six thousand yuan last year. Someone in the factory said: "We do not recognize this loss, because the enterprise company alone allocated more than ten thousand yuan to us for management fees." The Civil Engineering Company also has opinions because the health fees they turn in are not used for medical expenses, but are used by the Bureau's Health Division for the division's salary and miscellaneous expenses.

    I suggest that the Central Architectural Engineering Department should, in accordance with the State Council's instructions on streamlining staffing and reducing levels, seriously study the organizational structure and staffing quotas of each unit, and quickly abolish the organizational system of "the top imitates the bottom" and "everyone does their own thing."

    "Fourth-Class Cadres"
    Last year, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Postal and Telecommunications Administration requested its superiors to transfer many cadres from inland. Some of them were assigned jobs, and some were assigned to be "fourth-class cadres." The so-called fourth-class cadres are those who are "first-class for eating, second-class for getting off work, third-class for Sundays, and fourth-class for getting paid." The Hami Postal and Telecommunications Bureau already had enough cadres and did not ask the Administration for cadres, but the Administration assigned them two technicians, making them confused and not knowing what to have these two technicians do. The Artush Postal and Telecommunications Bureau already has three directors. This time, the Administration assigned them two more directors. How can one bureau use five directors? One switchboard operator was sent to raise horses because there was no work to do.

    These people were all selected from various postal and telecommunications bureaus in inland areas because of their good skills and strong abilities to support the construction of the border regions. They were full of enthusiasm and traveled thousands of miles, but who would have thought that they would become "fourth-class cadres" here? Luo Yansheng

    The Personnel Department's Difficulties
    One can often see articles criticizing the personnel department in the newspapers, especially the criticisms exposing overstaffing are becoming more frequent recently. We are engaged in cadre work, so we cannot ignore it, of course.

    Based on my many years of experience in cadre work, there are indeed many difficulties that cannot be appealed. This is not to say that we want to cover up our shortcomings and mistakes, nor is it to seek everyone's understanding and sympathy.

    There has long been an incorrect idea in the personnel department that this work is complicated, trivial, unrewarding, invisible in terms of achievements, and not able to learn skills. Therefore, many people are not at ease with this work. At the same time, there are indeed objective difficulties in the work.

    The first is that the plan is unstable and changes frequently: In the first half of 1955, the Shipbuilding Industry Administration of the First Ministry of Machine Building was ordered to streamline personnel, reducing several hundred people at once. After the anti-"Rightist" campaign in the second half of the year, it increased by several thousand people at once. Last year, there were more than ten new construction projects, and for a while there was a cry of "personnel shortage," and then a large-scale streamlining. It is easy to change the plan, but human problems are extremely difficult to deal with. In this way, the masses naturally accuse the personnel department of "bureaucratism and blindly transferring people." Our work is therefore in a passive position.

    The second is the departmentalism of business departments, disregarding the overall situation, making personnel transfers ineffective. The personnel department of the Shipbuilding Industry Administration transferred some people from the Jiangnan Shipyard to support the newly built Guangzhou Shipyard. The Jiangnan Shipyard not only refused to implement the transfer order, but also criticized the personnel department for being "subjective." And the Guangzhou Shipyard said that we could not allocate cadres according to the needs of the new factory, which is truly bureaucratism.

    Some business departments emphasize the needs of work, requiring more people, strong abilities, and smooth work. But the people who are transferred make a lot of noise, complaining that they have nothing to do, and demanding to be reallocated. But the business departments refuse to let them go. In this way, the hat of bureaucratism is put on again.

    The third is that some cadres are picky about regions and choose departments. They are unwilling to go to places they don't like. Southerners don't want to go to the north, and northerners are not used to the life in the south. People who are used to living in Shanghai are unwilling to go to small cities. In addition, they have to take care of their lovers and family members. If they are not careful, they scold the personnel department again.

    Finally, some people think that the personnel department is nothing more than allocating people, filling out forms, and reviewing cadres, reducing a political task to a routine task. In addition, some leaders do not pay attention to or support it, making the problem even more difficult to handle.

    Who is to blame? Where is the root of bureaucratism? We do not deny the shortcomings and errors in our work, and we also accept the accusations and criticisms of comrades. We also support the spirit of this central government's call for streamlining institutions. However, we also hope that leaders can do it themselves, instead of just shouting slogans for a while, like in the past, resulting in more and more bureaucracy. At the same time, think about those of us who are engaged in personnel work.

    上行下效　各搞一套
    中央建筑工程部中南地区管理总局，自去年1月份以来，新增设了五个处和一个工业企业联合公司。这些单位的增设有很多是不必要和重复的。为什么要增设呢？主要是由于中央建筑工程部对于所属各单位的机构设置缺乏认真和统一的研究布置，而部内各主管司（局）又单纯强调本系统的业务重要，对所属单位的机构设置过分强调必须“上行下效”的结果。如部内有个归部长直接领导的司（局处），就要求大区管理总局也必须单独设置一个职能处。前年12月份以前，大区管理局管理基本建设工作的是个基建科，部里基建司成立后，就通知大区也必须加强领导，改科为处；部卫生处因为是直接受部长领导的，因此在卫生工作会议上，也决定各大区必须设处；人事教育会议以后，也规定原有的人事处应该分设为人事和教育两个处；部运输局成立不几天，就向大区发电报，指示把原来的运输科也改为运输处；会计会议规定，大区除原有财务处以外还要再单设会计处……。
    因为这些机构的增加和扩大，人员编制也就必然要跟随着扩大。如原来领导和管理全局运输工作的运输科，人员最多时不超过十八人，改为运输处以后，到现在为止，已经增加到一百六十人，还说人不够。原来管理局所属三个附属工厂的局企业处，只有十九人，改为企业联合公司后，就增加到一百零三人。据这个单位经理说：如果照这个单位的业务最少还要再增加五十多人。其他单位也是如此。
    这些机构增加以后，工作效率并没有提高，公文运转的层次却增加了。如原来各附属厂有事情时直接请示总局生产企业处解决，时间最多不超过一个星期。现在，要先报企业联合公司，再由联合公司转报总局，经过往返批审、打印、收发等手续，就需要二十天以上。由于机构分的过细，有些工作划分不清，就你推我，我推你，互相踢皮球。如干部学习问题，人事处说：“应由教育处管”，教育处说：“应由人事处管。”
    由于人多事少，许多不应该管的事情也管起来了，限制了基层企业的积极性。如原来三个附属公司是独立经济核算单位，联合企业公司成立，他们就变成了内部核算单位，一切计划、财务，生产业务，内部人事调动等都要由公司统一平衡批审下达。所以有的单位负责人只管完成任务，其他指标就很少过问。这样多的人员的开支，因为行政无法报销，就只有摊入企业成本内。如中南轧铁五金厂去年预计亏损六千元，厂内有人说：“我们不承认这笔亏损，因为企业公司仅管理费一项就摊给我们一万多元”。土建公司也有意见，因为他们上缴的卫生费，不是做医务费用，而是被局卫生处作为处的工薪和公杂费开支了。
    我建议，中央建筑工程部应该根据国务院关于精简编制减少层次的指示精神，认真地研究一下各单位的组织设置和人员定额，赶快取消“上行下效”“各搞一套”的组织制度。　            何生
    “四等干部”
    新疆维吾尔自治区邮电管理局去年要求上级从关内给他们调来了很多干部，其中有一部分分配了工作，有一部分则被分配下去做了“四等干部”，所谓四等干部就是一等吃饭、二等下班、三等星期天、四等发工资。哈密邮电局的干部本已够用，也没向管理局要干部，可是管理局又分配给他们两名技术员，弄得他们莫名其妙，也不知让这两名技术员做什么好。阿图什邮电局已有三个局长，这次管理局又分配给他们两个局长；一个局怎么用得了五个局长呢？有一名话务员，因为没有工作做，竟被叫去养马。
    这些人都是关内各邮电局为了支援边疆建设，被选拔出来的技术好、能力强的干部。他们满怀热情，千里跋涉，可是，哪里想到竟在这里当起“四等干部”来了呢？                      罗衍生
    人事部门的苦衷
    在报纸上常常可以看到批评人事部门的文章，特别是最近揭发人浮于事的批评一天多过一天。我们是做干部工作的，当然不能置若罔闻。
    根据我多年在做干部工作中的体会，的确有不少苦衷无处申诉。这倒不是说要掩饰我们的缺点和错误，也不是要求得大家的谅解和同情。
    在人事部门长期存在着一种不正确的思想，认为这个工作繁杂、琐碎、出力不讨好，看不见成绩，学不到本领。因此很多人不安心这个工作。同时在工作中也的确有客观困难。
    首先是计划不稳定，变动多：第一机械工业部船舶工业管理局在1955年上半年奉令精简人员，一减就是好几百。下半年反“右倾”以后，一增就是好几千。去年十多个新建工程，一时在喊“人员紧张”，一时又在大量精简。计划改起来容易，可是人的问题却难办极了。这样，群众当然指责人事部门“官僚主义、盲目调人”。我们的工作因之也处于被动。
    第二是业务部门的本位主义，不顾整体，使人员调动不灵。船舶工业管理局人事部门从江南造船厂抽调一部分人支援新建的广州造船厂，江南造船厂不但不执行调令，反批评人事部门“主观”。而广州造船厂又说我们不能根据新厂的需要来调配干部，真是官僚主义。
    有些业务部门强调工作需要，人既要多，能力又要强，工作起来得心应手。但被调去的人又大吵大闹无事可作，要求重新分配工作。而业务部门又不放。这样，官僚主义的帽子又戴上来了。
    第三是有些干部挑地区、选部门，不乐意的地方就不愿去，南方人不愿到北方，北方人又不习惯南方的生活，在上海住惯了的人又不愿到小城市；再加上爱人、家属还得照顾。如果稍不周到，又骂人事部门。
    最后，有的人认为人事部门无非是调配人、填表、审干，把一个政治性的任务降为事务性的工作。再加上有的领导不重视不支持，问题就更难办了。
    到底怨谁呢？官僚主义的根源究竟在哪里呢？我们并不否认工作的缺点和错误，同时也接受同志们的指责和批评。这次中央号召精简机构的精神，我们也很拥护。不过，也希望领导能亲自动手，不要空喊一阵，像过去一样，结果越整越多。同时也替我们搞人事工作的人想一想。
