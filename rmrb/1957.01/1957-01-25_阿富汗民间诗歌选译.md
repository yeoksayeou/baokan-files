    Selected Translations of Afghan Folk Poetry

    (1) If my boyfriend gloriously sacrifices himself in battle, I will weave him a shroud with my own curly hair.

    (2) Since you value your individual life so much, – then how will you act facing the enemy's sharp sword in battle?

    (3) When you set off to fight, my dear, I wish to become a bright moon, illuminating your journey.
                * Since I personally send you to the battlefield, my dear, how can you still be a cowardly deserter?

    (4) These wounds, my friend, will not frighten me, I can heal your wounds with loving kisses. If you escape from the trenches unscathed, – then let my contempt become a sharp knife!

    (5) If your feet yield to fear, my female companions will despise me. Ah, rather let a bullet hit you, than have the news of your disgrace reach me.

    (6) I know why you are always uneasy here: because honor is there, on the border of the homeland defended by sharp swords. You have shamed yourself by fleeing from the sword; I truly regret, regret that I ever loved you!

    (7) If you fight the enemy and defeat him – wait, my kisses will be your medal.
                * If my friend is parched in battle, I will quench his thirst, with all the sweetness of my lips.

    (8) This is the kind of person I love: he can eliminate the enemy, and liberate my country from its shackles.
     (Translated by Lu Kanghua from the Russian version of "Afghan Poetry," the Russian translator is Alexandrov)

    Postscript: These folk poems were sung by Afghan women in the 17th-18th centuries, and they have not lost their brilliance to this day.

    阿富汗民间诗歌选译
    （1）假如我的男友在战斗里光荣捐躯，我就用自己的鬈发为他织一件殓衣。
    （2）既然你把个人生命看得如此贵重，——那末在斗争中面对敌人的利剑，你将会怎样行动？
    （3）当你出发去作战，我亲爱的，我愿变成一轮明月，照亮你的征途。
                ＊既是我亲自送你上战场，我亲爱的，难道你还能成为怕死的懦夫？
    （4）这些伤口，我的朋友，不会使我惊慌，用爱的蜜吻我能治愈你的创伤。如果你完整无恙从战壕里逃跑，——就让我的轻蔑，变成一把锋利的刀！
    （5）要是你的双脚对恐惧屈膝，我的女伴们会对我鄙弃。啊，宁愿让子弹打中你，也别传来你蒙上耻辱的消息。
    （6）我知道，为什么你在这儿总不安宁：因为荣誉在那儿，在那用利剑所捍卫的祖国边境。你从剑下逃归羞辱了自己；我真懊悔啊，后悔我曾爱过你！
    （7）如果和敌人撕杀，并且把他打败——你等着吧，我的亲吻将作为奖牌。
                ＊我的朋友在战斗中口干舌涸我就灌润他，用自己双唇的全部甘露。
    （8）这样的人我才爱：他能消灭敌人，又能把我的祖国从桎梏中解放出来。
     （卢康华选译自俄文版“阿富汗诗歌”，俄译者是阿历山大洛夫）
    附记：这些民间诗歌是阿富汗妇女在十七——十八世纪所唱的，直到现在，它们未失去光辉。
