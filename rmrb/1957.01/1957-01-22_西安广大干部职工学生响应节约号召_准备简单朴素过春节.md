    Xi'an's Broad Cadres, Workers, and Students Respond to the Call for Thrift
    Preparing to Spend a Simple and Plain Spring Festival
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The broad masses of working people in Xi'an are preparing to celebrate this year's Spring Festival in a simple and thrifty manner.
    Recently, the broad masses of workers, cadres, teachers, and students in many factories, construction sites, government offices, and schools in the Xi'an area have successively proposed to buy less or no pork during the Spring Festival; when entering or leaving the city, they generally do not take public buses unless there is an urgent matter; and they do not compete with ordinary residents for goods on the streets. Song Xiaodan, a worker and Communist Party member at the Dahua Textile Factory, proposed to the Party organization that he would not buy pork during the Spring Festival, and that he would explain the reasons to his family and not rush to buy pork. Many Party members in this factory have proposed to give the pork they do not buy to ordinary residents. The families of Jiaotong University's new Xi'an campus warmly responded to the Party's call to increase production and practice thrift, proposing to learn from the hard-working and simple lifestyle of the people of Xi'an, and to "eat whatever is available" this Spring Festival, without spending excessively.
    Youth League members Liang Peisheng, Zhang Gang, Wang Shuying, and eleven others, proposed five "Thrifty Spring Festival" initiatives to all League members and young people in the city in the early part of this month, guaranteeing that they would not be extravagant or wasteful during the Spring Festival, would not eat and drink extravagantly, and would not spend money recklessly; young people returning to their hometowns would not show off, act lavishly, or boast about their lives in front of the farmers, and would promote the Party's various policies to the masses everywhere. This initiative has received the support of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and has become a common action for League members and young people throughout the city.
    Saving coal for heating and cooking has also become a practical action for various government offices, organizations, schools, enterprises, and military units in Xi'an. According to the regulations of the Xi'an Municipal People's Committee, these units throughout the city should save 9,000 to 12,000 tons of coal for heating during this spring; and save 6,000 to 9,000 tons of coal for cooking in the first quarter. Recently, some residents have also proposed to no longer purchase the increased supply of coal that the government provides for them during the Spring Festival.
    All staff members of Xi'an's commercial and service industries are currently strengthening the transfer and transportation of Spring Festival supplies, and have decided to improve sales methods and appropriately extend business hours during the Spring Festival supply period to make it convenient for the masses to purchase. Some administrative management personnel of Xi'an's food, trade, and confectionery companies will also take time to participate in sales during the supply period, trying their best to ensure that the masses can buy holiday supplies and happily celebrate the Spring Festival.

    西安广大干部职工学生响应节约号召
    准备简单朴素过春节
    本报讯　西安市的广大劳动人民都准备简单朴素地欢度今年的春节。
    最近，西安地区的许多工厂、工地、机关和学校里的广大职工、干部和教师、学生，纷纷提出在春节期间少买或不买猪肉，进城和出外时，没有急事，一般不乘坐公共汽车，在街道上不和一般居民群众争购东西等。大华纺织厂工人、共产党员宋小旦，向党组织提出在春节不买猪肉，并要给家里人说清道理，也不要抢购猪肉。这个工厂的许多党员，都提出把自己不买的猪肉，让给一般居民群众。交通大学西安新校的家属们，热烈响应党的增产节约号召，提出要学习西安人民艰苦朴素的生活作风，在今年春节做到“有啥吃啥”，不过多地花销。
    青年团员梁培生、张刚、王淑英等十一人，在本月上旬向全市团员和青年，提出了“勤俭过春节”的五项倡议，保证在春节期间不铺张浪费，不大吃大喝，不乱花钱；回乡青年不在农民面前显体面、耍阔气、夸生活，到处向群众宣传党的各项政策。这个倡议得到青年团西安市委员会的支持，已成为全市团员和青年的普遍行动。
    节约烤火用煤和烧饭用煤，也成为西安市各机关、团体、学校、企业、部队等的实际行动。按照西安市人民委员会的规定，全市这些单位要在今春烤火期间节约九千至一万二千吨煤炭；在第一季度内节约六千至九千吨烧饭用煤。最近有些居民群众，也提出不再购买春节政府给他们增加供应的煤炭。
    西安市商业、服务业全体人员，最近正加强调运春节物资，并决定在春节供应期间改进售货方法，适当延长营业时间，使群众购买方便。西安市食品、贸易、糖业糕点等公司的一些行政管理人员，还要在供应期间抽空参加营业，尽量使群众买到节日用品，欢度春节。　（西安日报）
