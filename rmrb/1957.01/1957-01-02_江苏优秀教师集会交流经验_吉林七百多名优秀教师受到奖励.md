Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 30th - 1,102 outstanding middle and primary school teacher representatives from various parts of Jiangsu Province gathered from the 24th to the 29th at the Jiangsu Provincial Conference of Outstanding Middle and Primary School Teacher Representatives to exchange experiences in areas such as primary schools, preschool education, schools for the blind and deaf, normal schools, industrial and agricultural spare-time education, and middle schools.

　　Lü Lidao, a teacher at Juicheng Primary School in Juining County, is a young teacher who has only been teaching for two years. In the past year, he has created over 50 complex teaching aids, including water towers, tellurions, steam engines, and various calculators, in conjunction with his teaching. He is currently producing a complete set of natural science teaching aids. These aids can help students quickly understand many complex scientific principles.

　　Wang Bingheng, the principal of Nantong School for the Blind and Deaf, is an old teacher who has been teaching for 33 years and is now 65 years old. He led the teachers of the deaf department to change the old finger spelling method and adopted a new oral teaching method. Now, the teachers at this school can teach children just like they would normal children; as long as the teacher speaks to the children, the students can understand what the teacher is saying. Wang Bingheng also specifically helped the teachers of the blind department learn to use the new Braille teaching methods.

　　When compiling music textbooks such as music theory, sight-singing, sheet music, musical talks, music appreciation, singing conducting methods, and music teaching methods, Wen Huanna, a music teacher at Nanjing Normal School, paid attention to appropriately integrating some of the ethnic music materials she collected and researched to improve the quality of music teaching. She also created visual aids such as the "Staff Key Signature Teaching Aid."

　　The teaching and work experiences introduced by these outstanding teachers have been valued by the attendees.

　　This representative meeting also elected 94 representatives to attend the National Conference of Outstanding Middle and Primary School Teachers Representatives scheduled to be held in the second half of next year.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 31st - Xu Shou Xuan, Vice Governor of Jilin Province, awarded the "Outstanding Teacher of Jilin Province" medal to 767 outstanding teachers at the closing ceremony of the Second Jilin Provincial Conference of Outstanding Teacher Representatives on the 29th.

　　These awarded teachers were outstanding teacher representatives selected from middle and primary schools and industrial and agricultural spare-time schools in various parts of Jilin Province and the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture.

　　The awarded outstanding teachers love education and have achieved remarkable achievements in teaching. Many of them have also adhered to the principle of diligence and frugality in running schools. Sun Daojian, the principal of Pingdong Township Primary School in Siping City, risked his life to stay in the air-raid shelter to guard the school on the eve of liberation. After liberation, with the help of the People's Government and the masses, he personally built a broken temple into a complete primary school with more than 400 students and more than 30 school buildings. Most of the school's equipment and sports equipment were set up by Sun Daojian by mobilizing teachers and students. Kim Chang-ryong, a Korean teacher at Chatiaogou Primary School in Yanji County, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, has overcome difficulties and created more than 60 kinds of teaching aids, totaling more than 1,600 pieces, such as human skeletons, in his spare time over the years. In the classes he has been in charge of for the past eight years, there has never been a student who has repeated a grade.

　　The Second Jilin Provincial Conference of Outstanding Teacher Representatives began on the 23rd.

    江苏优秀教师集会交流经验
    吉林七百多名优秀教师受到奖励
    新华社南京30日电　江苏省各地一千一百零二名中等初等学校优秀教师代表，24日到29日在江苏省中、初等学校优秀教师代表会议上，交流了小学、幼儿教育、盲聋哑教育、师范、工农业余教育、中学等方面的工作和教学的经验。
    雎宁县雎城小学教师吕立道，是任教才两年的青年教师，他在近一年内结合教学制作了水塔、三球仪、蒸汽机和各种计算器等五十多件复杂的教具，现在他还在制作全套的自然学科的教具。这些教具能帮助学生很快地了解到许多复杂的科学原理。
    曾经任教三十三年现在已经六十五岁的老教师、南通市盲哑学校校长王秉衡，领导哑科教师改变旧的指语法，采用了新的口语教学法。现在这个学校的教师已经能够像对一般正常儿童上课一样，只要教师用嘴对着儿童讲，学生们都能看懂教师说的话。王秉衡还具体帮助盲科教师学会采用新盲字的教学方法。
    南京师范学校音乐教师温欢纳，在编写乐理、视唱、琴谱、音乐讲话、音乐欣赏、歌咏指挥法、音乐教学法等音乐教材时，注意把自己搜集研究的一些民族音乐资料适当地综合进去，提高音乐的教学质量。她还创作了“五线谱调号教具”等直观教具。
    这些优秀教师介绍的教学和工作经验，都受到了到会人员的重视。
    这次代表会议还选出了九十四名代表，准备出席预定在明年下半年举行的全国中、初等学校优秀教师代表会议。
    新华社长春31日电　吉林省副省长徐寿轩29日在吉林省第二届优秀教师代表会议闭幕式上，把“吉林省优秀教师”奖章授给了七百六十七名优秀教师。
    这些受奖的教师是从吉林省各地和延边朝鲜族自治州的中、小学和工农业余学校中选出的优秀教师代表。
    受奖的优秀教师热爱教育事业，在教学中获得了显著成就，有很多人还坚持勤俭办学的方针。四平市平东乡小学校长孙道肩在解放前夕，曾经冒着生命危险留在防空壕里看守学校。解放后，他在人民政府和群众帮助下亲自动手，把破庙建成为拥有四百多学生、三十多间校舍的完全小学。学校的设备和运动器械，大部是孙道肩发动教师和学生自己设置的。延边朝鲜族自治州延吉县茶条沟小学的朝鲜族教师金昌龙，几年来利用课余时间克服困难，制造了人体骨胳等六十多种共计一千六百多件教具。八年来在他所担任的班级里，没有出现过留级生。
    吉林省第二届优秀教师代表会议是从23日起举行的。
