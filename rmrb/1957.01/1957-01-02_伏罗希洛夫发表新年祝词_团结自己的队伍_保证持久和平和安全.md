Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 31st: According to TASS, Kliment Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, delivered New Year's greetings, extending New Year wishes on behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Soviet government, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the Soviet people.

He said that in 1956, the Soviet people achieved great successes. Encouraged by the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people overfulfilled the annual industrial plan and achieved a bumper harvest of agricultural products. The past year has seen much work done to improve the material well-being of the Soviet people, continuously develop culture, and enhance the enthusiasm of the working people. We have reason to be proud of our achievements, but we have not forgotten the shortcomings and difficulties that still need to be overcome on our road to victory.

Voroshilov said that the Soviet Union's active peaceful foreign policy played a very good role in the past year. The great People's Republic of China and the entire socialist camp are fighting alongside us for international peace and friendship. The people of Asia and Africa who are engaged in the struggle against colonial oppression and for independence regard the Soviet Union as a strong fortress of peace and freedom. The movement to defend peace is growing and consolidating day by day, and this movement has become a powerful force against warmongers. All this has aroused the fury and hostility of the imperialists. They invaded peaceful Egypt and instigated a counter-revolutionary riot in Hungary. However, the forces of peace are even stronger. The dangerous adventures of the imperialists were stopped. The Soviet people and all friends of peace and freedom have learned lessons from the events of the past year and will unite their ranks more closely to guarantee lasting peace and security. Comrade Voroshilov finally congratulated all the Soviet people on a happy New Year in 1957, wishing them achievements in all aspects. Voroshilov also extended New Year's greetings and best wishes to the fraternal people of socialist countries and the people of all countries.

    团结自己的队伍　保证持久和平和安全
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科12月31日讯：苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫发表新年祝词，代表苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏联政府和苏共中央委员会向苏联人民祝贺新年。
    他说，1956年苏联人民取得了巨大的成就。苏联人民在苏共二十次代表大会决议的鼓舞下，超额完成了工业年度计划，获得了农产品的丰收。过去一年为提高苏联人民物质福利和不断发展文化以及提高劳动人民的积极性做了不少的事情。我们有理由为我们所取得的成就而自豪，但是我们没有忘记在我们胜利的道路上还有尚待克服的缺点和困难。
    伏罗希洛夫说，苏联积极的和平外交政策在过去一年中发挥了很好的作用。伟大的中华人民共和国和整个社会主义阵营和我们一道为国际和平和友谊而斗争。欧亚两洲进行着反对殖民压迫和争取独立斗争的人民，把苏联看成是和平和自由的强大堡垒。保卫和平的运动日益成长和巩固，这种运动已经成了反对战争贩子的强大力量。所有这些引起了帝国主义分子的狂怒和敌视。他们侵犯了和平的埃及并且策动了匈牙利的反革命暴动。但是，和平力量更为强大。帝国主义分子危险的冒险行为被制止了。苏联人民和所有和平和自由的朋友们从去年的事件中吸取了教训，将更加紧密地团结自己的队伍以保证持久和平和安全。伏罗希洛夫同志最后祝贺苏联全体人民1957年新年快乐，祝贺他们在各方面获得成就。伏罗希洛夫还向社会主义国家的兄弟人民以及各国人民致新年的祝贺和美好的祝福。
