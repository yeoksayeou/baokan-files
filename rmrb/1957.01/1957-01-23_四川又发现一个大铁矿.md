Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 21st: The Sichuan Provincial Bureau of Geology has discovered another considerably large iron mine in southeastern Xichang. The ore body of this iron mine is six kilometers long and about two kilometers wide. This mine is a sedimentary deposit, and the pig iron smelted from its ore can be made into high-quality steel. This iron mine is even more important because it is located near the Panzhihua Iron Mine.

After a year of concentrated exploration last year, it has been proven that the ore layer of the Panzhihua Iron Mine is more than 200 meters thick at its thickest point and extends more than 700 meters underground at its longest. At the same time, two mining areas with reliable leads have been discovered on the periphery of the Panzhihua Iron Mine.

    四川又发现一个大铁矿
    新华社重庆21日电　四川省地质局在西昌东南又发现一个相当大的铁矿。这个铁矿的矿体长达六公里，宽约二公里。这个矿是沉积矿，用这个矿的矿石炼出来的生铁，可以炼成优质钢。这个铁矿因为邻近攀枝花铁矿，而显得更加重要。
    攀枝花铁矿经过去年一年的集中勘探，证明这个矿的矿层最厚的达二百多公尺，向地下延伸，最长的达七百多公尺。同时，在攀枝花铁矿外围又发现了两个有可靠线索的矿区。
