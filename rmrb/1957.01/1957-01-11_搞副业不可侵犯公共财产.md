	Engaging in Sideline Occupations Must Not Infringe Upon Public Property
	Recently, in Caopu and Baitabu in Donghai County, Jiangsu Province, where crystal is deposited, groups of male and female farmers have been digging for crystals day and night. Roads are often filled with ox carts loaded with crystals.
	According to the provisions of our country’s constitution, mineral deposits are owned by the whole people; the country’s public property is sacred and inviolable, and it is the duty of every citizen to cherish and protect public property. So why are local farmers privately mining state-owned crystals? It is said that they are digging for crystals as a sideline occupation to increase their income. Obviously, this practice is wrong. They regard the mineral deposits explored by the state with a large amount of funds as their private property. At the same time, the state's exploration task in this area has not yet ended. Due to their blind and chaotic digging, it is naturally difficult to provide accurate data for the calculation of mineral reserves, which also creates many difficulties for the country's future planned mining. Therefore, I suggest that the relevant local departments quickly stop this behavior of destroying state resources.　Peng Qisheng

    搞副业不可侵犯公共财产
    最近，在水晶蕴藏地江苏省东海县的曹浦和白塔埠各地，成群的男女农民日夜紧张地挖掘水晶，道路上常有满载水晶的牛车。
    根据我国宪法规定，矿藏属于全民所有；国家的公共财产神圣不可侵犯，爱护和保卫公共财产是每个公民的义务。那么当地农民为什么私自挖掘国家的水晶呢？据说，是把挖水晶当作搞副业，以增加收入。显然，这种作法是不对的。他们把国家用大量资金所勘探出来的矿藏视为私有了。同时，国家在这个地区的勘探任务还没有结束，由于他们的盲目乱挖，对矿藏储量的计算，自然很难提供准确的资料，对国家将来有计划地开采，也造成许多困难。因此，我建议当地有关部门迅速制止这种破坏国家资源的行为。　彭启胜
