    Automatic Doffing Device for Ring Spinning Frames

    (Our newspaper) This newspaper reports that, with the active support of the Party Committee and the Factory Director's office, Xue Jiting, a cadre of the Rationalization Proposal Committee of Qingdao State-owned Cotton Factory No. 6, and Li Rendong, a technician, and others, collectively researched and initially successfully trial-produced an automatic doffing device for ring spinning frames to replace manual doffing.

    This automatic doffing device for ring spinning frames is very clever. It consists of a special device powered by a motor to remove yarn tubes and insert wooden tubes. On top of the machine is a small iron box, like a funnel, for holding wooden tubes. To use this machine, simply install a track on the spine of the spinning frame and two electric wires below the track. During doffing, it moves continuously along this track, removing yarn tubes and inserting wooden tubes. It is sixteen inches long, eight inches wide, weighs a total of twenty kilograms including the one-eighth horsepower motor, and does not use many materials. The cost is only 500 yuan per unit.

    According to preliminary tests, this automatic doffing device can doff two yarn tubes per second. If a one-half or one-quarter horsepower motor is used, it can doff five yarn tubes per second, while a worker can currently only doff slightly more than one per second. (Attached picture)

    细纱自动落纱装置
    本报讯　青岛国棉六厂合理化建议委员会干部薛吉亭、技术工人李仁东等，在党委和厂长室的积极支持下，集体研究的代替人工落纱的细纱自动落纱装置初步试制成功了。
    这台细纱自动落纱装置很灵巧。它由一个马达劳动着拔管纱和插木管的特别装置，在机器的上边还装有像漏斗一样的一个盛木管的小铁箱。使用这种机器，只是在细纱机的龙骨上装设一条轨道，再在轨道的下面装上两条电线就行了。落纱的时候，它就沿着这条轨道不断地向前移动一边拔管纱一边插木管。它的面积长十六吋，宽八吋，连同八分之一马力的马达在内重量共二十公斤，并且用料不多，每台成本只五百元。
    据初步试验这架自动落纱装置每秒钟能落两个纱管，如果使用二分之一或四分之一马力的马达，每秒钟可落五个纱管，而现在一个工人每秒钟只能落一个多一点。（附图片）
