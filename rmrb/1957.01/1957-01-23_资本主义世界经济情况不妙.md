The capitalist world's economic situation is not good

    American prices rise
    "U.S. News & World Report" quoted official materials saying that at the end of 1956, the cost of living in the United States was 16% higher than in 1950. At the end of last year, the price of bread was 24% more expensive than in 1950, men's clothing was 12% more expensive, and housing construction costs were 41% more expensive.
    The magazine pointed out that prices have risen a lot since March 1956, but "the income of most residents has not increased." Due to rising prices, the sales of many kinds of daily necessities gradually became sluggish at the end of 1956. As a result, these commodities accumulated in the commercial network, causing production to contract.

    Large numbers of British workers are semi-unemployed
    Britain's growing economic difficulties are forcing thousands of workers to cut their weekly workdays or become homeless.
    The "Briggs Motor Bodies" factory in Dagenham announced the dismissal of another group of workers on the 15th. The number of workers dismissed has now reached about 2,400. "Austin Motor Company" also announced the dismissal of 300 workers on the 17th. The "Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft Company" factory will successively dismiss 500 to 600 workers.
    According to recent official data, there are now a total of 130,000 workers in Britain who are not working enough hours each week.

    France's foreign trade deficit increases
    According to materials from the French "Prospects Weekly," from 1955 to 1956, France's foreign trade deficit increased threefold, from 100 billion francs to 400 billion francs. During this period, French exports remained at their original level, while imports of foreign goods increased by 20%. The weekly specifically pointed out the increase in the dollar deficit in France's foreign trade. In the first eleven months of 1956, the dollar deficit increased by 228 million US dollars.

    Western Europe's oil supply faces crisis
    Becket, chairman of the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau Petroleum Committee," said at a press conference on the 14th that Western Europe's supply of diesel and fuel oil has "approached a crisis stage," with storage levels falling by one-third in a month.
    Becket also said that a survey by the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau" showed that the total oil storage in Western Europe on January 1 was 3.75 million tons. It is estimated that by February 11, it will be reduced to 2.5 million tons, which is only enough for the seventeen member countries of the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau" to consume for two weeks.

    资本主义世界经济情况不妙
     美国物价上涨
    “美国新闻与世界报道”引用官方材料说，1956年底美国的生活费用比1950年上涨16％。去年年底的面包价格比1950年贵24％，男子服装贵12％，住宅造价贵41％。
    杂志指出，1956年3月以来物价上涨了很多，可是，“大部分居民的收入却没有增加”。由于物价上涨，1956年末有许多种日用品销路逐渐不畅。因此这类商品就在商业网中积压起来，以至使得生产收缩。
    英国大批工人半失业
    英国日益增长的经济困难正促使成千上万的工人被迫削减每周的工作日或是流落街头。
    达金汉姆的“布列格斯汽车车身工厂”15日又宣布解雇一批工人。现在被解雇的工人已达两千四百人左右。“奥斯汀汽车公司”17日也宣布解雇三百个工人。“阿姆斯特朗·威特沃斯飞机公司”工厂将陆续解雇五百到六百工人。
    据最近的官方资料，英国现在总共有十三万工人每周都上不足工。
    法国对外贸易赤字增加
    据法国“展望周报”材料，从1955年到1956年，法国对外贸易赤字增加了三倍，从一千亿法郎增加到四千亿法郎。在这一时期，法国出口额依然停在原来水平上，而外国货物进口额却增加了20％。这家周报特别指出了法国对外贸易中美元赤字的增加。在1956年的前十一个月里，美元赤字增加了二亿二千八百万美元。
    西欧石油供应面临危机
    “欧洲经济合作局石油委员会”主席贝克特14日在记者招待会上说，西欧柴油和燃料用油的供应已经“接近危机阶段”，贮存量在一个月内下降了三分之一。
    贝克特还说，“欧洲经济合作局”的一次调查表明，1月1日西欧的石油总贮存量是三百七十五万吨。据估计，到2月11日就要减少到二百五十万吨，这个数量只够“欧洲经济合作局”的十七个成员国家消耗两个星期。
