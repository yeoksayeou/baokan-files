Xinhua News Agency, January 30th, New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the morning of the 29th to continue discussing the situation created by Israel's refusal to implement the United Nations resolution demanding the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli invading forces from Egyptian territory.

    Iraqi representative Jamali spoke first at the meeting, pointing out that Israel's demands to seize certain important areas of Egypt were unfounded. Jamali said that the practice of the "United Nations Emergency Force" occupying part of Egyptian territory – the Gaza Strip and the coast of the Gulf of Aqaba – was unacceptable because the United Nations armed forces were carrying out a completely different task, one that had nothing to do with occupation, but rather with the withdrawal of all aggressor troops from Egypt. Jamali urged the United Nations member states to condemn Israel's acts of aggression and to take resolute measures to implement the UN General Assembly resolution on the immediate withdrawal of all aggressor troops from Egypt.

    Subsequently, the head of the Soviet delegation, Kuznetsov, spoke. He emphasized that agreeing to Israel's demands would be tantamount to encouraging aggression. Kuznetsov condemned the plan to "internationalize" parts of Egyptian territory – the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba – which aimed to restore the colonial system, already rejected by the people, in Egypt and other countries in the Near East under a new guise.

    Kuznetsov said that Israel, with the support of the United States, was trying to use the bargaining chip gained through aggression to force Egypt to make concessions. He continued: "Any attempt to change the legal status of any part of Egyptian territory would be an act violating the armistice agreement and the United Nations Charter."

    Kuznetsov said that the United Nations Emergency Force could not be used to occupy Egyptian territory, or in a manner not expressly approved by the General Assembly resolution establishing the force. He said that the United Nations must take resolute measures to stop Israel's ongoing aggression against Egypt. The United Nations should issue a call against new plans to undermine Egypt's sovereignty and interfere in the internal affairs of Arab countries.

    Bolivian representative Quiroga-Galdo said that the General Assembly had no other path but to demand Israel's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Egyptian territory. Quiroga-Galdo advocated guaranteeing Israel's freedom of navigation in the Gulf of Aqaba through United Nations negotiations after Israel's withdrawal.

Xinhua News Agency, January 30th, New York Dispatch: At the beginning of the United Nations General Assembly afternoon session on the 29th, Saudi Arabian King Saud, who is currently on a state visit to the United States, delivered a brief speech. He said that his country adheres to the principles of international cooperation, peace, and common security, and opposes the principle of aggression.

    The Saudi Arabian King particularly pointed out the important role of the United Nations Charter and its provisions. He denounced "policies of hegemony through force." He pointed out that such policies create tension and are the main cause of the "Cold War." He went on to say that such policies are also the source of the arms race and the reason for armed conflicts in some parts of the world.

    The Saudi Arabian King finally called for the recognition of the right to self-determination for all nations.

    After a short break, the United Nations General Assembly turned to discuss the report of the Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee on the draft convention on the nationality of married women. The committee also passed the draft by a majority vote. The purpose of this draft is to oppose the unequal treatment of women in matters of nationality upon marriage, divorce, or a change in the husband's nationality.

    新华社30日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会29日上午举行全体会议，继续讨论以色列拒绝执行联合国要求以色列侵略军队立即无条件撤出埃及领土的决议而造成的局势问题。
    伊拉克代表贾马利在会上头一个发言，他指出以色列力图侵占埃及的某些重要地区的要求是毫无根据的。贾马利说，由“联合国紧急部队”占领埃及的一部分领土——加沙地区和亚喀巴湾沿岸的做法是不能容许的，因为联合国武装部队执行的完全是另一种任务，这种任务与占领无关，而是要所有侵略者的军队撤出埃及。贾马利敦促联合国各会员国谴责以色列的侵略行动，并且采取坚决措施履行联大关于立即从埃及撤退一切侵略军队的决议。
    随后，苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫发言。他强调指出，同意以色列的要求，就等于鼓励侵略。库兹涅佐夫谴责把埃及的一部分领土——加沙地区和亚喀巴湾——“国际化”的计划，这个计划的目的是要在新的招牌下在埃及和其他中近东各国恢复已经被人民所摈弃的殖民制度。
    库兹涅佐夫说，以色列正在美国的支持下，试图利用由于侵略而获得的讨价还价的本钱来迫使埃及让步。他接着说：“改变埃及任何部分领土的法律地位的任何尝试，都将是一种违反停战协定和联合国宪章的行为。”
    库兹涅佐夫说，不能利用联合国紧急部队来占领埃及领土，或以规定创立这支部队的大会决议所没有明文批准的方式来使用联合国紧急部队。他说，联合国必须采取坚决措施，制止以色列仍在进行的对埃及的侵略。联合国应该发出反对破坏埃及主权和干涉阿拉伯国家内政的新计划的呼声。
    玻利维亚代表基罗卡—加尔多说，大会除了要求以色列立即无条件地从埃及领土上撤兵外，别无其他道路。基罗卡—加尔多主张在以色列撤兵之后，通过联合国的谈判保证以色列可以在亚喀巴湾自由通航。
    新华社30日讯　纽约消息：在联合国大会29日下午会议开始时，正在美国作国事访问的沙特阿拉伯国王沙特发表了简短的演说。他说，他的国家奉行国际合作、和平和共同安全的原则，反对侵略的原则。
    沙特阿拉伯国王特别指出联合国宪章及其条款的重要作用。他指责“靠武力实行霸权的政策”。他指出，这种政策造成紧张局势，是“冷战”的主要原因。他接着说，这种政策还是扩充军备的根源，是世界上有些地区发生武装冲突的原因。
    沙特阿拉伯国王最后号召承认各民族的自决权。
    在短时间休息后，联合国大会转入讨论社会、人道及文化委员会提出的关于已婚妇女国籍的公约草案的报告。委员会并且以多数票通过了这个草案。这个草案的宗旨是反对妇女在结婚、离婚和丈夫改变国籍时在改变国籍问题上受到的不平等的待遇。
