    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Jiangsu Xinhua Daily: The Jinlian Agricultural Cooperative in Qingpu County, Jiangsu Province, recently averaged nearly five pigs per household and more than one pig per person. The cooperative has 313 households with 1,371 people. The number of pigs in pens recorded in December of last year was 1,513. Last year alone, pig raising increased the cooperative's net income by more than 62,000 yuan, accounting for 35.3% of the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations. 98% of the members increased their income.
    Raising more pigs not only directly increased the income of the members but also brought great benefits to the cooperative. Originally, the cooperative had 30 mu of small powdery soil fields with very poor soil quality, yielding only 80 jin of wheat and 300 jin of rice per mu. Since the cooperative started raising pigs, it applied 1,800 dan of pig manure, improving the soil. In 1956, each mu yielded 180 jin of wheat and 500 jin of rice.
    Last year, the cooperative sold as many as 452 meat pigs to the state, supporting national construction and supplying the needs of urban people's lives. At the same time, the amount of meat eaten by the members also doubled. The average person ate 12 jin of pork in the previous year, which increased to 24 jin last year. Ordinary members can eat meat twice a week.
    In the past, this cooperative rarely used substitute feed for raising pigs. Each meat pig had to eat 350 jin of staple grain (wheat, corn) and 50 jin of soybean cake. As a result, the cost was high and wasteful. In the previous year, the cooperative even lost more than 400 yuan in pig raising. Because "raising pigs doesn't make money," the members were unwilling to raise them. Later, the management committee discovered that Jin Menglin, an old member in his fifties, was raising pigs without feeding a lot of grain but using substitute feed, and the pigs were growing well. So, they summarized and promoted his experience. At the same time, they mobilized the masses to tap the potential of feed and found more than 60 kinds of substitute feed. For example, from Qingming to Lixia (from early April to early May), the bottom of every creek is covered with "spring pig grass." Every ten jin of "spring pig grass," after drying, can be equivalent to one and a half jin of bran. Last year, the cooperative salvaged and dried 100 dan of "spring pig grass," which was stored until winter to feed the pigs. In spring, summer, and autumn, the cooperative can salvage an average of 400 dan of wild grass and plant leaves, stems, and other substitute feed every day. In addition to feeding the pigs at that time, they can also store some for rainy days. In this way, the cost of raising pigs was greatly reduced, and the members' concerns about raising pigs not making money were eliminated.
    While collecting substitute feed, the cooperative also established 100 mu of feed base, of which 70 mu can be planted with five crops a year: The first crop of green vegetables is planted at "Winter Solstice" and harvested at "Awakening of Insects"; the second crop of green vegetables is planted at "Awakening of Insects" and harvested at "Grain Rain"; before the second crop of green vegetables is harvested, the third crop of pumpkins is intercropped at "Qingming"; after the second crop of green vegetables is harvested at "Grain Rain," the fourth crop of corn is intercropped in the pumpkin fields; after the pumpkins and corn are harvested at "Autumn Begins," the fifth crop of carrots is planted, harvested at "Winter Solstice," and then green vegetables are planted again... In this way, one mu of land can yield 134 dan of various pig feeds per year. The members said, "From March to October, we can get inexhaustible feed from the river, and from November to April, we can eat inexhaustible feed from the land."
    Will establishing a feed base affect grain production? They did a trial calculation: 100 mu of feed base will yield 50,000 jin less grain than originally planting rice and wheat, but the harvested feed can raise 800 pigs. The pig manure applied to the fields can yield more than 67,000 jin of grain. After offsetting the income and expenditure, it will still increase grain production by more than 17,000 jin.
    In terms of feeding management, in addition to collective raising by the cooperative and private raising by the members, the method of "public ownership and private raising" is also adopted, that is, the publicly owned piglets are handed over to poor members who cannot afford to raise pigs. Eight pigs are in one shed, and the cooperative subsidizes 1.5 fen of feed land per pig, with a feed cost of 21 yuan per pig. It is stipulated that they must grow to 110 jin within five months, accumulate 150 dan of pig manure, and record 1,400 work points. Those who overproduce will be rewarded according to a certain proportion, and those who reduce production will be compensated according to the specific situation. This method not only solved the cooperative's difficulty in lacking collective feeding experience but also stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses to raise pigs. It also made full use of the members' original pig raising equipment, saved the cooperative's expenses, tapped the potential of surplus labor, and saved every bit of dishwashing water and leftover food to feed the pigs.
    Now, the members of this cooperative have personally experienced the benefits of raising pigs and are no longer "afraid that raising pigs is not cost-effective" or "afraid of affecting labor income." This year, they also plan to increase the cumulative number of pigs raised from more than 6,800 last year to 10,752, continue to increase fertilizer accumulation, improve their lives, and supply the state with more meat pigs.

    金联社养猪多积肥多产粮多收入多
    经验证明：养猪对社员是合算的，饲料问题是可以解决的
    本报讯　据江苏新华日报报道：江苏青浦县金联农业社最近平均每户养猪近五头，每人养猪一头多。这个社共有三百一十三户，一千三百七十一人，去年12月份的养猪圈存数字是一千五百一十三头。去年单养猪一项，全社就增加纯收入六万二千余元，占农副业总收入的35.3％，98％的社员都增加了收入。
    多养猪，不仅直接增加了社员的收入，还给这个社带来了很大的好处。原来社里有三十亩小粉土田，土质很坏，每亩只收麦子八十斤，稻子三百斤。自从社里养猪以后，就上了一千八百担猪圈肥，改良了土壤，1956年每亩收麦子一百八十斤，稻子五百斤。
    去年全社售给国家的肉猪即达四百五十二头，支援了国家建设和供应了城市人民生活的需要。同时，社员吃肉的数量也增加了一倍。每人在前年平均吃猪肉十二斤，去年就增加到二十四斤。一般社员，每个星期都可以吃到两次肉。
    这个社过去养猪，很少使用代饲料。每头肉猪要吃三百五十斤主粮（麦子、玉米）、五十斤豆饼。结果，成本高，浪费大。前年，全社在养猪方面，还亏本四百多元。因为“养猪不赚钱”，社员都不愿养。后来，管委会发现五十多岁的老社员金梦林养的猪，不喂很多粮食而用代饲料，猪还长得很好，就总结和推广了他的经验。同时，发动群众挖掘饲料潜力，找到了六十多种代饲料。如从清明到立夏期间，每条浜的河底都长满“春猪草”。而每十斤“春猪草”，晒干后就能抵一斤半糠。去年，社里捞晒了一百担“春猪草”，一直贮藏到冬天还能喂猪。在春夏秋三季里，全社平均每天能捞到野草和植物叶、茎等各种代饲料四百担，除当时喂猪外，还能储存一些，以备雨天喂猪。这样，就大大降低了养猪成本，社员怕养猪不赚钱的顾虑也消除了。
    在采集代饲料的同时，社里还建立了一百亩饲料基地，其中有七十亩每年可以种五熟：即“冬至”种第一熟青菜，到“惊蛰”收；“惊蛰”种第二熟青菜，到“谷雨”收；第二熟青菜未收起，又在“清明”夹种第三熟南瓜；到“谷雨”收起第二熟青菜后，再在南瓜田里夹种第四熟玉米；到“立秋”收起南瓜、玉米以后再种第五熟胡萝卜，到“冬至”收起再种青菜……。这样，一亩田每年可收各种猪饲料一百三十四担。社员说：“3月到10月河里取不尽，11月到4月地上吃不完。”
    建立了饲料基地会不会影响粮食增产呢？他们试算了一下：一百亩饲料基地要比原来种稻、麦少收五万斤粮食，但所收的饲料可养八百头猪，这些猪圈肥上在田里，可多收六万七千多斤粮食。收支相抵，还增产一万七千多斤粮食。
    在饲养管理方面，除社里集体养和社员私人养以外，还采取了“公有私养”的方式，即把公有的苗猪交给养不起猪的贫困社员饲养，每八头猪为一棚，由社里贴给饲料地一分五厘，每头猪饲料费二十一元，规定在五个月内长到一百一十斤，积猪圈肥一百五十担，记工一千四百分，超产者按一定比例给予奖励，减产者分别具体情况酌情赔偿。这个办法，既解决了社里缺少集体饲养经验的困难，又启发了群众养猪的积极性，还充分利用了社员原有的养猪设备，节约了社里开支，发挥了剩余劳力的潜力，并把一点一滴的刷锅水、剩菜饭都节省下来喂猪。
    现在，这个社的社员们已经亲身体会到养猪的好处，不再“怕养猪不上算”、“怕影响劳动收入”了。他们今年还打算把养猪的累计数字由去年的六千八百多头增加到一万零七百五十二头，继续增积肥料、改善生活和供应国家更多的肉猪。
