Xinhua News Agency, January 20th dispatch: According to TASS reports, newspapers in Western European countries published and commented on the Sino-Soviet Joint Statement.

    Paris newspapers published on the morning of January 19th carried news about the Sino-Soviet Joint Statement in prominent positions. "Liberation" emphasized the important significance of this document. "Echo" particularly pointed out that the unity of the socialist camp in the face of the capitalist world is undoubtedly consolidated.

    Italian newspapers all summarized and published the Sino-Soviet Joint Statement. "Unità" wrote that this document "has enormous international significance because it touches upon all aspects of the current international situation." The newspaper emphasized that the basic spirit of the statement is the reaffirmation of the solidarity of the socialist camp confronting imperialist conspiracies, and the reaffirmation of the firm desire to maintain world peace.

    Italian bourgeois newspapers published excerpts of the statement and issued malicious commentaries attempting to diminish the significance of cooperation and friendship between socialist countries.

    The West German "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" wrote that the "agreement of views between the Soviet Union and China on ideological and foreign policy issues is beyond any doubt."

    British newspapers prominently carried news about the Sino-Soviet Joint Statement. The main focus of the newspapers was on the section of the statement that the Soviet Union and China are willing to support the people of the Near and Middle East and believe that the Egyptian government's demand for compensation from Britain, France, and Israel for all losses caused by their acts of aggression must be met.

    Dutch newspapers today prominently carried news of the Sino-Soviet Joint Statement. The Dutch "De Waarheid" reported on the joint statement in detail, with the headline: "Expressing in the name of 800 million people: The Soviet Union and China's consistent views on socialist and peaceful policies. The forces of peace far outweigh the forces of imperialism."

    意大利各报全都摘要刊载了中苏联合声明。“团结报”写道，这项文件“具有巨大的国际意义，因为它涉及了目前国际局势的一切方面。”这家报纸强调指出，再次肯定同帝国主义阴谋对抗的社会主义阵营的团结、再次肯定维护世界和平的坚定愿望，是声明的基本精神。
    意大利资产阶级报纸摘要刊载了声明内容，并且发表了别有用心的评论，企图缩小社会主义国家之间的合作和友好的意义。
