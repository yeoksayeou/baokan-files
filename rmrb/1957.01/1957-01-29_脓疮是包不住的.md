International Notes

    A Boil Cannot Be Wrapped Up
    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's mouth has gotten him into trouble again.
    On January 25, while continuing to testify on the "Eisenhower Doctrine" before the joint meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Military Committee, he said, "If I were an American boy, as you say, going to fight in the Middle East, I would rather not have French and British troops on either side of me. I think I would feel much safer that way." Dulles's words inadvertently revealed that the U.S.'s so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" is an aggressive plan to kick Britain and France out of the Middle East and go it alone. No wonder his words immediately aroused great resentment from the British and French bourgeois newspapers.
    In fact, the United States has been pursuing such a double-dealing policy in the Middle East in the past: on the one hand, it encouraged Britain and France to suppress the national independence movements of the Middle Eastern people, and sponsored their armed aggression against Egypt; on the other hand, it hoped that its two adversaries in the Middle East would suffer setbacks in their aggressive adventures, so that it could squeeze them out of the Middle East and establish its own rule there. The failure of the British and French aggression against Egypt meant that the United States' first objective was not achieved; the national independence movements in the Middle East were not only not suppressed, but became even more vigorous; however, the United States' second wish did not fail, and the influence of Britain and France in the Middle East was greatly weakened. As a result, Washington's plan to replace the British and French colonialists with its aggressive "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Middle East was born. Naturally, this ambitious U.S. aggression plan not only angered the people of the Middle East, but also stung its British and French "allies."
    London and Paris have long complained about the U.S.'s trickery in the Middle East. Many Western newspapers have pointed out that the U.S.'s Middle East policy of sacrificing Britain and France for its own benefit has deepened the rift between the U.S. and Britain and France. That is why U.S. Senator Fulbright's request for the White House to publish a "white paper" on recent U.S. Middle East policy was rejected by Dulles. Because such a "white paper," its content is not as white as its cover, it will not only expose the U.S.'s ferocious face more thoroughly to the people of the Middle East, but also increase the resentment of its British and French "allies" towards the U.S. Therefore, Dulles said: such a document would only "reopen newly healed wounds."
    Regardless of whether the wounds between the U.S. and Britain and France have healed, even if the surface scab has formed, there is obviously still a pus-filled blood clot with the stinky smell of petroleum gas inside the scab, then this boil is bound to be "reopened."

    脓疮是包不住的
    美国国务卿杜勒斯的嘴巴又惹祸了。
    1月25日他在参议院外交委员会和军事委员会的联席会议上继续为“艾森豪威尔主义”作证时说：“如果我是一个像你们所说的美国男儿，到中东去作战，我宁愿左右没有法国兵和英国兵，这样我想我会觉得安全得多”。杜勒斯的这番话无意中暴露了美国的所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”就是一个要在中东一脚踢开英法而单独干的侵略计划”。难怪他的话马上引起了英、法资产阶级报刊的极大愤懑。
    事实上，美国过去在中东就是实行这样一种两面三刀的政策：一方面鼓励英国和法国去镇压中东人民的民族独立运动，赞助它们对埃及进行武装侵略；另一方面则盼望它在中东的这两个敌手在侵略冒险中遭到挫折，以便可以把它们排挤出中东而在那里建立自己的统治。英、法侵埃失败，美国的前一个目的未能达到，中东的民族独立运动不但没有被镇压下去，而且更加高涨起来；但是美国的后一个愿望却没有落空，英法在中东的势力大为削弱。于是，华盛顿准备在中东取代英法殖民者的侵略计划“艾森豪威尔主义”就出笼了。很自然，美国这种野心勃勃的侵略计划不但激怒了中东人民，同时也刺痛了它的英法“盟友”。
    伦敦和巴黎方面对于美国在中东的诡计多端早就发出过不少怨言。许多西方报纸都曾指出，由于美国采取牺牲英法而给自己谋利的中东政策，已使得美国和英、法之间的裂痕加深了。这就是为什么美国参议员富布赖特要求白宫发表关于最近美国中东政策的“白皮书”，遭到了杜勒斯的拒绝。因为这样一本“白皮书”，它的内容并不像它的书皮那样洁白，它不仅会把美国的狰狞面目更彻底地暴露于中东人民的面前，而且势将增加它的英法“盟友”对美国的怨忿。所以杜勒斯说：这样的文件只会“把新结好的疮疤重新揭破”。
    姑勿论美国和英法之间的伤口是否已经结了疤，就算是表皮的疮疤已经结好了吧，但是这疮疤的里面显然还存在着一泡带有石油气味的腥臭的脓血，那末这个脓疮就是要“重新揭破”的。
