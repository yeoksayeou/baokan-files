Why is the Silk Production Situation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Not Good?
Sun Guang

Zhejiang and Jiangsu are China's two major silk producing areas. The output of raw silk accounts for two-thirds of the country's total output, and the amount of silk exported from Zhejiang has reached more than 40% of the country's total silk exports. Many silks, such as Zhejiang's "He He" brand raw silk, Gu Xiang satin, Lu Shan yarn, special Ge, brocade, and Jiangsu's Ku satin, double tube silk, etc., are very famous internationally. One ton of raw silk can be exchanged for eighty-eight tons of steel, and one ton of silk fabric can be exchanged for two hundred and forty tons of steel. In the few years since liberation, the silk exported from Zhejiang alone could be exchanged for the steel rails to lay one hundred and twenty-six Shanghai-Hangzhou railways.

Since 1954, various factories have continuously tried to produce new products, increase output and quality, and the sales of products have expanded day by day. Silk has been sold to sixty-eight countries. In 1955, Zhejiang's raw silk production increased by three and a half times compared with 1949, and silk fabrics increased by about 30% compared with 1949; Jiangsu Province's silk production also increased significantly compared with before. Despite this, silk production still far cannot meet domestic and international needs. However, since last year, the attendance rate of workers in silk reeling factories in Zhejiang and Jiangsu has generally declined, and the enthusiasm for production has been hindered by unreasonable processing methods, so the production situation is not good enough. For example, last year, Zhejiang's silk reeling factories did not complete the planned total output value and total output for the whole year.

Why has production decreased?

Currently, silk reeling factories in Zhejiang and Jiangsu are responsible for supplying raw materials by commercial departments, which entrust them with processing. The factories only receive processing fees. The price of raw materials, raw material freight, and storage fees are all reimbursed based on actual costs. However, the profit of each factory is determined based on the indicators of the sample factory. If it reaches or exceeds this indicator, it will make money; if it does not reach it, it will lose money. The sample factory has better equipment, the technical level of workers is generally above average, there are many engineers and technicians, and it operates on a single shift. The equipment of general processing factories is poorer, and in recent years, due to the increase in shifts, many new workers have been added, and the average technical level is low. Therefore, when processing the same quantity and quality of raw materials, the quantity and quality of products processed by general processing factories often do not reach the indicators of the sample factory. The finished product inspection standards of the sample factory and the processing factory are also different. The sample factory only checks the uniformity and fineness of the silk, while the processing factory must check the percentage of qualified products, physical indicators, strength elongation, etc.

This processing method is unreasonable, and it is reflected in the following aspects:

1. It encourages the non-economic accounting thinking of general processing factories. In order to reach the indicators of the sample factory and to make money, general processing factories have to arrange their plans in the most reliable way—finding good raw materials to reel high-grade silk. Good raw materials for high-grade silk are labor-saving and profitable, while inferior raw materials for low-grade silk are money-losing and laborious. Therefore, everyone considers saving raw materials and rationally utilizing raw materials very little. In Zhejiang, the phenomenon of everyone抢 (qiang - vying) for good raw materials has appeared. Often, a batch of cocoons is transferred from another place to this factory, and this factory thinks it is not good and asks to change it. Changing it back and forth wastes hundreds of yuan in freight at a time. Zhejiang has many cocoons, and every year it has to support Jiangsu and Guangdong. In principle, the cocoons from Jiaxing, which is closest to Jiangsu, should be transferred to Jiangsu, but the industrial departments disagree, so they have to transfer cocoons from Deqing or Hangzhou, which are half as far away from Jiaxing. Of course, necessary adjustments between regions are still unavoidable in order to match the patterns, but a large part of this is for "selection" to be transferred back and forth. In recent years, a lot has been wasted due to the roundabout transportation of raw materials.

2. Production is unstable, affecting workers' income. The sample indicators are not realistic, and the grade of silk is judged by the eye, so it is difficult for processing factories to complete their production tasks even if they think of many ways. In order to make money, factories, in addition to selecting good raw materials, easily make ideas on workers and increase quotas. Factory Director Wang of Wuxi Silk Reeling Factory No. 6 said: "Losing one grade for every 100 kilograms of silk will lose 90 yuan. In order to ensure the production of AA grade silk, the car speed must be reduced. If the car speed is slow, the output target cannot be completed." Wuxi Silk Reeling Factory No. 6 is a newly established joint venture factory, with new workers accounting for 45%. It lost 18,000 yuan in the first half of last year. Some factories have to rely on loans to pay wages. In the third quarter of last year, six of the sixteen silk factories in Zhejiang had losses. Some factories, when they have a lot of losses, increase production quotas, and when they have profits, they reduce quotas. If the quota is high, the workers cannot reach it, and their income decreases; if the quota is low, the workers exceed the quota too much, and the factory loses more. Therefore, in the past, the completion of quotas by silk reeling workers in Wuxi was "wave-like" and very unstable. In the first half of October last year, the workers of Jiangsu Province Meixin Silk Factory received an average of only 94.68% of their wages, reaching 104.97% in the second half of the month, 97.51% in the first half of November, and 103.3% in the second half of November. From the first quarter to the third quarter of last year, the wages of all production workers in Jiangsu Province were underpaid by more than 42,600 yuan (including hourly wages and absenteeism). Workers received less wages and often raised opinions to the trade union. Recently, silk factories in Jiangsu Province have implemented a new wage calculation method, and the workers' wages are more stable than before, but there is a situation of rather low than high.

3. It undermines the enthusiasm of workers to learn advanced experience. The work fees are announced very late each time. Commercial departments are afraid of losing money, so they often announce it after four or five months, the purpose is to wait until the new cocoons are reeled, to find out the bottom line of general processing factories, and actually want to calculate more accurately. During this period, the method of prepaying and contracting processing fees is adopted. This puts the factory's production management in a passive state. Factories and workers generally are not willing to learn and promote advanced experience, because they are afraid that after promoting advanced experience, improving labor productivity, and reducing costs, commercial departments will also correspondingly change the sample indicators. Therefore, some people say: "If we don't promote advanced experience, we may still have some profits. If we promote advanced experience, we may not even have this little profit!"

In order to change this situation, the industrial departments of Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces require that the industrial departments themselves control the raw materials, and the commercial departments purchase products based on quality grading and pricing. This opinion is worth considering. Comrade Chen Yun proposed in his speech at the "Eighth National Congress" that the purchasing and sales relationship between industrial and commercial enterprises should be changed. The processing and ordering method implemented by commercial departments to factories should be changed to a method in which factories purchase raw materials and sell goods. This method has been started to be tested in other industrial departments. According to the results of Shanghai's food industry's trial of self-sales, it has been very successful. The entire industry has gone from general difficulties to turning for the better, and products have changed from a large backlog to being in short supply. If this method can work in the food industry, which has a wide variety of products, then why can't it be implemented in the silk industry, which has a relatively simple variety? Even if this method has difficulties and cannot be implemented for the time being, the unreasonable parts of the current processing method should also be changed.

    江浙丝绸生产情况为何不好？
    孙光
    浙江和江苏是我国的两大丝绸产地，生丝产量占全国总产量的三分之二，浙江丝绸出口的数量已经达到全国丝绸出口量的40％以上。很多丝绸，如浙江的和合牌生丝、古香缎、卢山纱、特号葛、织锦，江苏的库缎、双管绢等等，在国际上都是很有名的。一吨生丝可以换八十八吨钢材，一吨丝织品可以换二百四十吨钢材。解放几年来仅仅浙江出口的丝绸，就可以换回铺设一百二十六条沪杭铁路的钢轨。
    1954年以来，各厂不断试制新产品，提高产量和质量，产品销路一天比一天扩大，丝绸已经销到六十八个国家。1955年，浙江生丝的产量比1949年增加三倍半，绸缎比1949年提高30％左右；江苏省丝绸产量也比以前大大增加。尽管如此，丝绸的产量还远远满足不了国内外的需要。可是从去年以来，浙江、江苏缫丝厂工人的出勤率却普遍下降，生产的积极性又受到不合理的加工办法所阻碍，所以生产情况不够好。例如去年浙江缫丝厂全年总产值和总产量都没有完成计划。
    为什么会减产呢？
    目前浙江、江苏缫丝工厂是由商业部门负责供应原料，委托它们加工。工厂只拿加工费。原料价格、原料运费和保管费都是实报实销的。而每个工厂的利润却是根据试样厂的指标来决定的，达到和超过这个指标的，就有钱赚，达不到的则赔钱。试样厂的设备比较好，工人技术水平一般都在中等以上，工程、技  术人员多，又是单班操作。一般加工厂的设备则较差，近年来，因为增加班次，新工人增加很多，平均技术水平低。所以，加工同样数量和质量的原料，一般加工厂加工出来的产品数量和质量，往往达不到试样厂的指标。试样厂的和加工厂的成品检验标准也不同，试样厂只检查丝的匀度和纤度，加工厂要检查正品率，物理指标，强力伸度等等。
    这个加工办法是不合理的，表现在以下几个方面：
    一、助长一般加工厂的非经济核算思想。一般加工厂为了达到试样厂的指标，为了赚钱，不得不把自己的计划安排在最可靠那一档上——找好原料缫高级丝。好原料缫高级丝，省力又赚钱，次原料缫低级丝，赔钱又费力。于是大家对节省原料，合理利用原料，考虑得很少。在浙江就出现了大家都抢好原料的现象。常常是一批茧子从别的地方调到这个厂，这个厂认为不好，又要求换。换来换去，一次就浪费几百元运费。浙江茧子多，每年都要支援江苏和广东。按理应该把离江苏最近的嘉兴的茧子调给江苏，但是工业部门不同意，只好把距离比嘉兴远一半的德清或杭州地区的茧子调出去。当然，为了搭配条纹，地区之间必要的调剂还是不可避免的，但这里有很大一部分是为了“挑选”才调来调去的。几年来，因为原料迂回运输，浪费不小。
    二、生产不稳定，影响工人收入。试样指标订得不切合实际，加上丝的等级又是凭眼睛来判断的，加工厂尽管想了很多办法，也很难完成生产任务。工厂为了赚钱，除了选好原料以外，很容易在工人身上打主意，提高定额。无锡缫丝六厂王厂长说：“每一百公斤丝降低一个等级就要赔九十元，为了保证出AA级丝，就得降低车速，车速慢了产量指标又完不成。”无锡缫丝六厂是个新合营厂，新工人占45％，去年上半年亏损一万八千元。有的工厂发工资都要靠贷款。去年第三季度浙江十六个丝厂有六个厂有亏损。有些工厂在亏损多的时候，就提高生产定额，有了盈余，再降低定额。定额高了工人达不到，收入就减少；定额低了，工人超额多，工厂亏损多。因此，过去无锡缫丝工人完成定额情况是“波浪式”的，很不稳定。江苏省美新丝厂去年10月上半月，工人平均只拿到工资的94.68％，下半月达到104.97％，11月上半月为97.51％，11月下半月是103.3％。江苏省去年一季度到三季度，全部生产工人的工资少支付了四万二千六百多元（包括计时工资、缺勤的在内），工人少拿了工资，经常向工会提意见。最近江苏省丝绸工厂执行了新的工资计算方法，工人的工资比以前平稳了，但又出现了宁低勿高的情况。
    三、打击工人学习先进经验的积极性。每次工缴公布得很迟。商业部门怕自己吃亏，往往是四、五个月后才公布，目的是等新茧开缫以后，摸一下一般加工厂的底，实际上是想算得更精确一些。在这期间采取预付和约付加工费的办法。这样，使工厂生产管理处于被动状态。工厂和工人们一般都不大愿意学习和推广先进经验，因为怕推广先进经验，提高劳动生产率，降低成本以后，商业部门也跟着相应地改变试样指标。所以，有的人说：“不推广先进经验，还可能有点利润，推广了先进经验，可能连这一点利润都没了！”
    为了改变这种情况，浙江和江苏省的工业部门要求由工业部门自己掌握原料，商业部门以按质分等论价的办法收购产品。这个意见是值得考虑的。陈云同志在“八大”发言中提出了应该“改变工商企业中的购销关系。应当把商业部门对工厂所实行的加工定货办法，改为由工厂购进原料、销售商品的办法”。这个办法已在其他工业部门开始试行。据上海食品工业试行自销的结果，是很成功的，全行业已由普遍困难走向好转，产品由大量积压变为供不应求。像食品工业这种产品种类繁多的行业都可以行得通，那么品种比较单纯的丝绸工业为什么不可以实行呢？这个办法即使有困难，暂时不能实行，现在加工办法里面的不合理部分，也是应该改变的。
