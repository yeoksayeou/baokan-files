The friendly visits of the Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai to various parts of Poland in recent days have become the focus of attention for the people of China and Poland. The Chinese government delegation has been warmly welcomed and cordially received by the Polish Party, government, and working people everywhere. Polish Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz said at a grand reception for the Chinese government delegation: "The People's Republic of Poland and the People's Republic of China are linked by unbreakable bonds of friendship, based on common ideals, common efforts to build a better new life, and the common struggle for peace." This sentence aptly expresses the Polish people's deep friendship towards the Chinese people.

Poland is an ancient European country with glorious traditions and rich culture. Poland has produced great geniuses such as Copernicus, Mickiewicz, and Chopin, who have made brilliant contributions to the world's cultural treasury. Although China and Poland are geographically far apart, the Chinese people have always held the Polish people, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition, in respect and admiration. At the same time, our people's decades-long struggle for liberation against domestic reactionaries and foreign imperialists has also won the sympathy and concern of the Polish people.

After the liberation of the Polish people and the victory of the Chinese revolution, the friendly relations between the people of China and Poland entered a new period of development. Poland was one of the first countries to recognize the People's Republic of China and announce the establishment of diplomatic relations with our country. In the early days of their domestic construction, the Polish people used great efforts to help the newly born New China engage in economic recovery and development. In recent years, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Poland in political, economic, and cultural fields, based on the spirit of proletarian internationalism, have been greatly developed and strengthened.

The governments of China and Poland have consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy. Having suffered from the disaster of war, the Polish people love peace and actively participate in the struggle to safeguard European and world peace. In the United Nations Organization, Poland, together with the Soviet Union and other countries, has continuously strived to enable the United Nations to play its due positive role. The Chinese people gratefully note that Polish representatives have actively supported the restoration of our country's legitimate status and rights in international affairs and supported our country's struggle to liberate Taiwan in the United Nations and other international organizations. In 1950, when the American aggressors invaded Korea and advanced towards the northeastern border of China, the Polish government and people repeatedly voiced their support for the Chinese and Korean people. At the Seventh United Nations General Assembly, the Polish delegation put forward positive suggestions for easing international tensions, which played a promoting role in the adoption of a resolution on the Korean ceasefire. In 1953, the Polish government and people, by participating in the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, helped the Korean armistice. In 1954, Polish representatives also participated in the Indochina International Commission, helping to restore peace in Indochina. The Polish commissioners and staff members who participated in the Korean armistice work, like the Czechoslovak commissioners and staff members, disregarded the unreasonable obstruction, coercion, insult, and intimidation of the American side, always adhered to a just position, and strived to supervise the armistice and maintain the implementation of the armistice agreement. The people of China and Korea and all peace-loving people in the world expressed their heartfelt admiration for the Polish commissioners' just work and valuable contributions.

Similarly, our country has also given full support to Poland and other fraternal countries in Eastern Europe for their just struggle to establish a European collective security system and oppose the rearmament of West Germany. In May 1955, Vice Premier Peng Dehuai participated in the eight-nation European conference held in Warsaw as an observer and expressed his full support for the Warsaw Treaty. This action of the Chinese government and people aroused great repercussions among the Polish people. The "Warsaw Life" newspaper believed that this was "the light of China's peace power shining on Europe."

The frequent mutual visits between the leaders of China and Poland in the past three years are of great significance for strengthening the understanding and cooperation between the two governments. In July 1954, our Premier Zhou Enlai, after attending the Geneva Conference, was invited to pay a friendly visit to Poland; in October of the same year, Vice Premier Chen Yi visited Poland for six days at the invitation of the Polish government. A delegation of the Polish government came to our capital, Beijing, in 1954 to participate in the celebration of the fifth anniversary of our National Day. Following Vice Premier Peng Dehuai and Vice Premier He Long's visits to Poland in 1955, Vice Chairman Zhu De visited Poland in early 1956. During their visits, the Chinese leaders conveyed the fraternal greetings of our people to the Polish people.

In the economic field, the cooperation between China and Poland is becoming closer day by day. The economic relations between our two countries are established and developed on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. In February 1950, China and Poland signed a barter contract and a barter protocol in Beijing, which was the first trade agreement we signed with an Eastern European people's democratic country since the founding of our country. Through trade relations, our country has obtained from Poland the steel, machine tools, transportation equipment, agricultural machinery, chemical raw materials, and daily necessities necessary for industrial and agricultural construction; Poland, on the other hand, has obtained from our country various minerals, agricultural products, and livestock products needed for socialist construction. Poland has provided our country with a complete set of equipment for two modern sugar refineries, and is now completing the technical design for a new and larger sugar refinery for our country.

With the increasing development of economic construction in both countries, the variety and turnover of goods exchanged between China and Poland are also constantly expanding. In 1956, the total trade volume between China and Poland increased by about 46% compared with 1951. The development of trade between China and Poland provides favorable conditions for ensuring the ever-increasing needs of the people of both countries in production and life and promoting the economic prosperity of both sides.

The regular navigation of Polish merchant ships between China and Poland is an important factor in the economic cooperation and trade development between the two countries. In 1950, there were only two irregularly sailing ships between the two countries. After the establishment of the Sino-Polish Shipping Company in 1951, the transportation of goods between the two countries has greatly developed. At present, the fleet of merchant ships traveling between the ports of China and Poland is the largest merchant fleet in Poland, with a carrying capacity of 8,000 to 10,000 tons per ship. These ships not only serve the exchange of goods between China and Poland, but also serve China's trade with other people's democratic countries and the shipping with some capitalist countries that have trade relations with China. This not only guarantees the implementation of trade agreements between our country and Eastern European fraternal countries, but also shatters the conspiracy of the US imperialism to "blockade" and "embargo" our country. Polish sailors have overcome the artificial obstacles set up by the imperialists and gloriously completed the shipping task. This courageous spirit is a moving manifestation of friendly assistance to the Chinese people.

The friendly cooperation between China and Poland has also had very good development in the cultural field. Since the signing of the cultural cooperation agreement between the two countries in Warsaw in 1951, the two countries have mutually dispatched various cultural delegations, art troupes, and artists for friendly visits, and have mutually held exhibitions of various kinds. As of the end of 1956, according to incomplete statistics, a total of 86 delegations from our country had visited Poland, and 66 delegations from Poland had visited our country. More than two million viewers have visited the Chinese exhibitions held in Poland. The people of our two countries respect each other's cultural traditions. In 1953, Poland responded to the call of the World Peace Council and commemorated the 2,230th anniversary of the death of the great Chinese poet Qu Yuan. The Chinese people have also successively commemorated the 410th anniversary of the death of the great Polish scientist Copernicus and the 50th anniversary of Madame Curie. Tens of thousands of Chinese audiences watched Polish films such as "The Last Stage," "The Youth of Chopin," and "The First Days." Chinese films "The White-Haired Girl," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," and "Letter with Feather" also left a deep impression on Polish audiences. In the first quarter of 1956, more than 700,000 Polish viewers watched 18 Chinese documentaries, feature films, and animated films.

Mutual publication of books and exchange of students are also effective ways of cultural exchange. Since liberation, Poland has published 50 Chinese works, totaling about one million copies, including the works of Chinese theorists, writers, and poets. Thirteen kinds of Comrade Mao Zedong's theoretical works have been published in Poland. The "Zhuangzi," written by the ancient Chinese philosopher Zhuang Zhou, was translated into Polish for the first time and published. At present, there are 114 Chinese students studying in Polish universities. There are 33 Polish students studying in Chinese universities.

In science, technology, post and telecommunications, and radio broadcasting, China and Poland have also signed relevant agreements, and cooperative relations are developing smoothly. The outstanding contributions of ancient Polish scholars in science are well known. Now, Poland has its own specialties in certain aspects of science and technology, such as coal mining, shipbuilding, construction, mathematics, and the invention and creation of electronic computers, which are worth learning by the Chinese people. The cooperation protocol between the two academies of sciences signed by the delegations of the two academies of sciences in Warsaw last October will play a significant role in the exchange of scientific and technological achievements between the two countries.

While strengthening friendly and cooperative relations, our people have always been concerned about the development of socialism in Poland and the efforts of the Polish people to maintain and improve socialist construction. The friendly visit of the Chinese government delegation this time once again expressed the Chinese people's concern for the Polish people. The talks between the government delegations of China and Poland will undoubtedly further strengthen the friendly cooperation between the two countries and promote the socialist construction of the two countries. The strengthening of the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Poland and the progress of socialist construction will be a valuable contribution to strengthening the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and to safeguarding the cause of world peace.

    日益发展的中波友好合作关系
    黎昂
    以周恩来总理为首的中国政府代表团这几天在波兰各地进行的友好访问，成了中波两国人民注意的中心。中国政府代表团到处受到了波兰党、政府和劳动人民的热烈欢迎和亲切接待。波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹在一次为中国政府代表团举行的盛大招待会上说：“波兰人民共和国和中华人民共和国之间有牢不可破的友谊的纽带联系着，这种友谊建立在共同的理想上，建立在为建设美好的新生活而进行的共同努力上，建立在争取和平的共同斗争上。”这句话恰当地表达了波兰人民对中国人民的深厚友情。
    波兰是欧洲一个古老的国家，有光荣的传统和丰富的文化。波兰人民当中曾经出现过像哥白尼、密茨凯维支、萧邦等这样一些伟大的天才，对世界文化宝库作出了辉煌的贡献。虽然中波两国在地理上相隔很远，但是，中国人民对于富有光荣的革命传统的波兰人民，一向怀着崇敬和钦佩的心情。同时，我国人民数十年来为反对本国反动派和外国帝国主义者而进行的解放斗争，也曾赢得了波兰人民的同情和关怀。
    波兰人民解放和中国革命胜利以后，中波两国人民的友好关系进入了一个新的发展时期。波兰是最先承认中华人民共和国并宣布同我国建立外交关系的国家之一。波兰人民在忙于他们国内建设的初期，就用了很大力量来帮助刚刚诞生的新中国从事经济的恢复和发展。几年来，以无产阶级国际主义精神为基础的中波两国在政治、经济、文化各方面的友好合作关系，已经大大地发展和加强了。
    中国和波兰两国政府都一贯地奉行着和平的对外政策。饱经战争灾难的波兰人民热爱和平，积极地参加了维护欧洲和世界和平的斗争。波兰在联合国组织中，和以苏联为首的社会主义国家以及其他国家一道，不断地为使联合国组织起到它应起的积极作用而努力。中国人民怀着感激的心情注意到，波兰代表在联合国和其他国际组织积极支持恢复我国在国际事务中的合法地位和权利，支持我国解放台湾的斗争。1950年，当美国侵略者进犯朝鲜并向中国东北边境推进的时候，波兰政府和人民不止一次地声援了中朝人民。在第七届联合国大会上，波兰代表团提出了争取缓和国际紧张局势的积极建议，对通过建议朝鲜停火的决议起了推动作用。1953年，波兰政府和人民用参加朝鲜中立国监察委员会和中立国遣返委员会的行动，帮助了朝鲜的停战。1954年，波兰代表又参加了印度支那国际委员会，帮助恢复印度支那的和平。参加朝鲜停战工作的波兰委员和工作人员，和捷克斯洛伐克委员和工作人员一样，不顾美国方面的无理阻挠、胁迫、侮辱和恫吓，始终坚持公正的立场，努力监督停战、维护停战协定的实施。中朝人民和全世界爱好和平的人民都对波兰委员的公正工作和宝贵贡献表示衷心的敬佩。
    同样，我国对波兰和东欧兄弟国家为建立欧洲集体安全体系和反对重新武装西德的正义斗争，也给予了充分的支持。1955年5月，彭德怀副总理以观察员身份参加了在华沙举行的欧洲八国会议，并且表示全力支持华沙条约。中国政府和人民的这一行动在波兰人民群众中引起了巨大的反响。“华沙生活报”认为，这是“中国的和平力量照耀着欧洲”。
    三年来，中波两国领导人之间频繁的相互访问，对于加强两国政府的了解和合作具有重大的意义。1954年7月，我国周恩来总理在参加了日内瓦会议以后，应邀对波兰进行了友好访问；同年10月，陈毅副总理又应波兰政府的邀请在波兰访问了六天之久。波兰政府代表团1954年来到了我国首都北京，参加了我国国庆五周年庆祝典礼。继彭德怀副总理和贺龙副总理在1955年先后访问波兰以后，朱德副主席又在1956年初对波兰进行了访问。中国领导人员在参观、访问期间向波兰人民转达了我国人民的兄弟问候。
    在经济方面，中波两国之间的合作一天比一天密切。我们两国间的经济关系是在平等、互利的原则上建立并发展起来的。1950年2月，中波两国在北京缔结了易货合同和易货议定书，这是我们建国以来第一次同东欧人民民主国家签订的贸易协定。通过贸易上的联系，我国从波兰取得了工农业建设所必需的钢材、工作母机、运输设备、农业机器、化工原料和人民日用必需品；波兰方面则从我国得到了社会主义建设所需的各种矿产品、农产品和畜产品。波兰已经提供给我国两个现代化的制糖厂的全套设备，现在又为我国完成了一个新的、规模更大的制糖厂的技术设计工作。
    随着两国经济建设的日益发展，中波双方货物交换的品种和周转额也在不断扩大。1956年我国和波兰的贸易总额已经比1951年增加了46％左右。中波两国贸易的发展，为保证两国人民在生产和生活上不断增长的需要、促进双方的经济繁荣，提供了有利的条件。
    波兰商船在中波之间的定期航行，是两国经济合作和贸易发展的重要因素。在1950年的时候，两国间只有两艘不定期航行的轮船往来。1951年成立了中波海运公司以后，两国间的货物运输就大大地发展起来。目前往来于中波两国港口的商船队，是波兰最大的商船队，每只商船的载运能力从八千吨到一万吨不等。这些船只不仅为中波两国的货物交换服务，也为中国同其他人民民主国家的贸易以及同某些与中国有贸易关系的资本主义国家的航运服务。这不但保证了我国同东欧兄弟国家之间的贸易协定的执行，而且粉碎了美帝国主义对我国“封锁”、“禁运”的阴谋。波兰海员们克服了帝国主义者树立的人为障碍，光荣地完成了航运任务，这种勇敢精神是对中国人民友好援助的动人的表现。
    中波两国的友好合作在文化方面也有着十分良好的发展。自1951年两国在华沙签订文化合作协定以后，五年多来，两国互相派遣了各种文化代表团、艺术团体和艺术家进行友好的访问，互相举办了各种性质的展览会。截至1956年底，据不完全统计，我国共有八十六个代表团访问了波兰，波兰也有六十六个代表团访问过我国。参观过在波兰举办的中国展览会的观众共达二百多万人。我们两国人民都尊重彼此的文化传统。1953年，波兰响应世界和平理事会的号召，纪念了中国伟大诗人屈原逝世两千二百三十周年。中国人民也相继纪念了波兰的伟大科学家哥白尼的四百一十周年忌辰和居里夫人的五十周年忌辰。成千上万的中国观众观看了波兰电影“最后的阶段”、“萧邦的青年时代”、“最初的日子”等。中国电影“白毛女”、“智取华山”、“鸡毛信”也给波兰观众留下了深刻的印象。在1956年第一季中，七十多万波兰观众看了十八部中国纪录片、故事片和动画片。
    互相出版书籍和互派留学生也是文化交流的有效方式。解放以来，波兰已经出版了五十种中国著作，共一百万册左右，其中包括中国的理论家、文学家和诗人的作品。毛泽东同志的理论著作已经在波兰出版了十三种。中国古代哲学家庄周的“南华真经”第一次翻译成波兰文出版。目前，我国派往波兰高等学校学习的学生共有一百一十四人。波兰派来我国高等学校留学的学生共有三十三人。
    在科学、技术、邮电、广播等方面，中波两国也签订了有关的协定，合作关系正在顺利地发展。波兰古代学者在科学上的卓越贡献是人所共知的。现在，波兰在科学技术的某些方面，如采煤、造船、建筑、数学、电子计算机的发明和创造等，都有自己的特长，值得我国人民学习。去年10月，两国科学院代表团在华沙签订的两国科学院合作议定书，将对两国科学技术成就的交流起重大的作用。
    在加强友好合作关系的同时，我国人民一直关怀着波兰社会主义的发展，关怀着波兰人民为维护和改进社会主义建设而进行的努力。这次中国政府代表团的友好访问，再一次表达了中国人民对波兰人民的关怀。中波两国政府代表团的会谈，无疑地会进一步加强中波两国的友好合作，促进两国的社会主义建设。中波两国人民兄弟友谊的加强和社会主义建设事业的进展，对于加强以苏联为首的社会主义国家的团结，对于维护世界和平事业，将是有价值的贡献。
