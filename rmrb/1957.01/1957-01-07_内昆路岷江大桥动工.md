Construction Progress

    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 6th. Construction began on the Minjiang Bridge on the Neikun Railway on the 4th. This is a challenging railway bridge spanning deep water. According to the design, three of the bridge's piers will be built on the riverbed in areas with a water depth of more than sixteen meters.

    The team building this bridge consists of experienced bridge construction personnel from the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction site and the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. The entire project, from design to construction, will be completed independently by Chinese technical personnel.

    The Minjiang River is one of the main tributaries of the Yangtze River. This tributary joins the Jinsha River in Yibin, southern Sichuan, before flowing into the Yangtze River. The Neijiang-Kunming railway, which is under construction from Neijiang, Sichuan, to Kunming, Yunnan, will cross the deep, fast-flowing Minjiang River via the Minjiang Bridge, pass through a tunnel, and then connect to the future Jinsha River Railway Bridge.

    The bridge is expected to be completed in the second half of this year.

    内昆路岷江大桥动工
    新华社成都6日电　内昆铁路岷江大桥4日动工兴建。这是一座艰巨的横跨深水的铁路桥。按照设计，这座桥有三个桥墩将建在水深十六公尺以上的江心地层上。
    承建这座桥的，是来自武汉长江大桥工地和宝成铁路的有经验的桥梁人员。这座桥从设计到施工，全部工程将由中国技术人员自己完成。
    岷江是长江的主要支流之一。这条支流在四川南部的宜宾同金沙江一起和长江会合。正在修建的从四川内江到云南昆明的铁路，将通过岷江大桥跨过水深流急的岷江江面，穿过一个隧道，然后通向未来的金沙江铁路大桥。
    这座桥预计在今年下半年建成。
