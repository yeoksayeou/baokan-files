At ten o'clock in the morning, I took a bus from Zagu'nao in western Sichuan, and arrived in Wenchuan County at 6:40 p.m.

Wenchuan, formerly known as Weizhou, is not a large place, but it has mountains and rivers. The mountains here have gradually become gentle, unlike the steep and peculiar mountains in the Zagu'nao area.

The station hostel was a newly built, beautiful and spacious building, but when I asked, it was already full of guests. At this time, the cafeteria was steaming with noodles being cooked, and the aroma of noodles and meat wafted over and over. I was already hungry and wanted to sit down and eat two bowls, but the passengers rushed to the cable bridge, so I picked up my package and followed closely behind. The cable bridge was made of bamboo ropes with wooden planks laid across it, suspended over the water. Walking on it felt shaky and unstable. Those who were used to it did not feel scared at all, but it was not so easy for me. Especially when walking in the middle of the bridge, the bridge was trampled by pedestrians and bounced up and down even more violently, making creaking noises. I held on to the bamboo ropes on the side and managed to get across. Walking on the cable bridge, I heard the passengers talking about the difficulty of finding accommodation. The small hotels in the city were also in short supply, which was why the passengers were rushing ahead.

When I got to the other side, it was already dark, and the shops on both sides were lit up. I went up to any shop with a hotel sign or lantern hanging over the door and asked, "Are there any rooms available?" I was disappointed in four or five places in a row.

I was almost at the end of the street, and I still hadn't found a place to stay.

Turning a corner, there was a small wooden storefront ahead, with a square red paper lantern hanging under the eaves, swaying from side to side in the wind. Although the light was very dim, I could clearly see two lines of calligraphy on the door: "Seek lodging before it gets late, look at the sky early when the rooster crows." In this remote mountain town, on this windy street, these two old sayings seemed particularly warm.

Looking inside the door, there was an old lady in her fifties sitting next to a table, her round, red face illuminated by the lamp. She was wearing a half-new blue cloth jacket; her mouth was a little sunken, but she always had the kind smile common to mothers. At first, she also said that the rooms were all full and there was no way to arrange accommodation. I repeatedly asked her to think of a way. She turned the vegetable oil lamp up a bit brighter, and held it up tremblingly, looking me up and down. Seeing that I was carrying three or four packages of all sizes in my hands, she said in a tone that was both concerned and scolding, "If you plan to stay at an inn, you should come earlier!" With that, she took the lamp and led me inside.

The wind blew the flame of the oil lamp crookedly, and she shielded it with her hand, walking into the fourth guest room next to the earthen wall. Pushing open a creaking small door, a large bed occupied half of the room. It seemed that the bed was already occupied by guests, and there were cart driver's tools on it. What was particularly eye-catching was the red tassel tied to the horse's neck. The old lady said, "How about staying in this room?" Actually, I had no opinion on the room, as long as I could lie down.

I put down my luggage and went out to find a food stall and ate a little something. When I returned to the inn, the travelers were all at rest. The courtyard was pitch black, and I vaguely saw the old lady hunching over, carrying grass to make a bed for me, looking very strenuous. I quickly went forward and took the grass, and walked to the door. I vaguely saw two more figures, bending over to flatten the straw on my newly made bed. The straw made a rustling sound and a smell of grass leaves that had been piled up for a long time.

These two people were undoubtedly the two cart drivers who would be sharing the room with me tonight. One was about thirty years old, with a long face, black and shiny skin, broad shoulders, and a blue cloth scarf wrapped around his head. At first glance, he was an honest and sincere peasant. The other was a little younger, with a pair of slightly protruding front teeth, wearing a blue uniform, with a pen stuck in his pocket, like a village cadre. As soon as they saw me come in, they looked at me, waved their hands, and chuckled twice. Then, as if they didn't need to be introduced to each other, they quickly took the grass and continued to make the bed for me. I felt an unspeakable warmth and gratitude in my heart. This small inn was just like my home.

Although I was very tired, I couldn't close my eyes and fall asleep. The two cart drivers sleeping on the big bed across from me were also wide awake, so we started chatting.

They were members of an agricultural cooperative in the Fifth District of Wenchuan County. This time, they were driving a cart to transport the burnt lime to the city to support basic construction. They talked in detail about their experience in developing sideline occupations and their determination to overcome difficulties. They also told me proudly that the fat black mule tied under the shed was the collective property of the cooperative. They said that this mule was full of energy. When going uphill or on bad roads, with a flick of the whip, it would run as fast as a swallow. ...

I listened and listened. At first, I was still looking at the starlight revealed above the roof tiles, but later, I fell asleep unconsciously.

The next day, just as it was barely light, they leaned over and whispered in my ear, "Comrade, get up quickly, it's dawn!" Because they knew I had to hurry back to Chengdu, and I had to get up early to buy a train ticket.

I quickly put on my clothes and went to the toilet. A faint white moonlight filled half of the small courtyard, and in the distance I could already hear a sparse crowing of roosters. ...

At the time of parting, I shook hands tightly with the two cart drivers. The black mule snorted loudly, and the wheels rolled on the stone road, heading north.

    投宿
    高原
    上午十点钟，由川西杂谷脑搭汽车，六点四十分就到了汶川县。
    汶川，古称威州，地方虽然不大，但有山有水，山势到了这里，已经逐渐平缓下来了，不像杂谷脑一带峥嵘奇突。
    车站旅社，是新修的很漂亮宽敞的楼房，问了问，已经住满了客人。这时，食堂里正热气腾腾地在煮面条，面香和肉香一阵一阵扑过来。我早已饿了，很想坐进去吃两碗，可是旅客们争先恐后地向索桥走去，我也就拎着包裹紧跟着走上了索桥。索桥，是竹绳上面横搭着木板悬在水上的，走上去摇摇欲坠，很不稳定，走习惯了的人，丝毫不觉得骇怕，可是对我来说，就不是那么容易了。尤其走在桥中央，桥被行人踩得上下颠簸得更加厉害，发出吱吱的响声，我扶着边边上的竹绳，好容易才走了过去。走在索桥上，听旅客们攀谈住宿的困难，城内几家小旅店，也供不应求，旅客们所以争先恐后，也正为此。
    上了对岸，天色已经暗了，两旁的店铺已经点上了灯火。凡是门檐上挂着旅店招牌或灯笼的，我都上前问一问：“还有房间没有？”接连四五家，都使我失望。
    街快走完了，住处还没有着落。
    一转弯，前面有一间小小的木板门面，一盏红纸的方灯，悬挂在屋檐下，被风吹得左右摆动。灯光虽然很弱，但却能清楚地看出门上两行墨笔字：“未晚先投宿，鸡鸣早看天”。在这偏僻的山城，在这凉风呼呼的街头，这两句老话好像使人感到特别亲切。
    再向门里一张望，桌子旁坐着一个五十多岁的老大娘，灯光照着她红通通的胖脸。她穿着一件半新的蓝布褂；嘴，虽嫌有些凹了进去，但总是带着母亲们共有的和善笑容。开始，她也说房间都住满了人，无法安插。我再三请她想想办法，她把菜油灯挑得亮一些，颤巍巍地拿着，朝我打量了一下，见我手里大大小小拎着三四个包裹，带着又关怀又像是责备似的口气说：“打算住客栈，就应该早些来嘛！”说着，拿着灯火，就引我向里面走去。
    风把油灯的光焰吹得歪歪斜斜的，她用手遮着，走进靠土墙边第四间客房。推开一扇吱吱发响的小门，里面一张大床已占去房间的二分之一，看样子，床上已经住了客人，上面放着赶马车的用具，特别引人注目的，是系在马脖子上的红色缨络。老大娘说：“就在这间房子里住怎么样？”其实，我对房子丝毫没有意见，只要能够躺下就可以了。
    我把行李放下，出去找了家食铺，胡乱吃了一点东西。回店的时候，旅客们都安息了。院子里一片漆黑，我隐约地看见老大娘伛偻着身体在为我抱草铺床，看样子非常吃力。我连忙上前把草接了过来，走到门口，模糊不清地又看见有两个人影，正弯着腰在为我新搭的床上摊平稻草。稻草发出簌簌的响声和一股堆压久了的草叶香味。
    这两个人，无疑就是今天晚上将和我同房的那两位赶马车的客人。一个有三十来岁，长方形的脸，黑而发光，宽宽的肩膀，头上围着一个蓝布帕子，一看就知道是个朴实诚笃的庄稼汉子。另一个年纪稍微轻一些，一对门牙向外微微的翘着，一身蓝制服，口袋上还插了一支钢笔，像个村干部。他们一看见我进来，朝我望了望，扎煞着手，嘿嘿笑两声之后，彼此好像都不需要介绍，便连忙把草接了过去，继续替我铺好。我心里有说不出的温暖和感激，这小旅店，简直像我家庭一样。
    虽然我很疲倦，但是，我却不能瞑目入睡。睡在我对面那张大床上两个赶马车的客人，也丝毫没有睡意，于是我们又攀谈开了。
    他们是汶川县第五区某农业社的社员，这次赶车，是为了把烧成的石灰，运到城里去支援基本建设。他们详细地攀谈起他们发展副业的经过和克服困难的决心，并且用夸耀的口气告诉我，拴在棚底下那匹膘满肉肥的黑骡子，是社里公有的财产，他们说这个骡子浑身都是劲，上坡、走烂路，鞭子一扬，就像燕子一样的飞跑。……
    我听着、听着，开始，眼睛还望着屋瓦上面露出的星光，后来，不知不觉便迷迷糊糊地睡着了。
    第二天，天才麻麻亮，他们便伏在我的耳旁低声地叫醒我：“同志，快起来吧，天已亮了！”因为他们知道我还要赶回成都，车票必须起早才能买到。
    我连忙披衣起来，走向厕所，一抹淡白的月影，照满了半个小院，远处已经稀稀疏疏听见一声两声雄鸡的啼叫了。……
    临别的时候，我和那两个赶马车的客人紧紧地握了一次手。那匹黑骡子连连地喷着响鼻子，车轮在石板路上轱辘辘地滚动着向北驰去了。
