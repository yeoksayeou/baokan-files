I was born twice in this harsh and lovely land. The first time I saw this land – it lay in boundless darkness. The darkness mixed many fairy tales into a jumble, and I myself didn't know how I survived. There was one fairy tale that was the most dismal – it described Tsarist Russia as a prison. Just as Gogol wrote, dead men crawled out of their graves in the darkness. But I used all my youth to defend the birth of the great dawn. I stumbled forward, and it was not in vain: when the golden sunlight of October shone on my head – the date of my second birth finally arrived. Only then did I step into this fairy tale, which I could only dream of before. I didn't notice how I suddenly crossed half the globe, nor did I notice how I spent so much time. I have passed through wind, snow, and flames, and I have fearlessly crossed the lies of the times. Millions upon millions of fearless hearts have cultivated my courage. I understand the greatness of man. I was not born in a dream, but live in reality. I live in a wonderful era, I spend my days in a human fairy tale. About this fairy tale, people before October could only dream of in the dark. But I saw how the dawn of human truth rose on this earth.

### 我降生了两次

    我降生了两次
    尼·吉洪诺夫在这严峻、可爱的土地上，我降生了两次。第一次我看到了这土地——它躺在茫茫的黑暗里。黑暗把许多童话混成一团，我自己也不晓得怎样活了过
  来。有个童话最阴惨——它描述沙皇俄国如监狱。正像果戈里写的那样，在黑暗里由坟墓中爬出死人。但我用了自己的全部青春，卫护了伟大黎明的诞生。我曾踉跄前进，这没有徒劳：当十月金黄色的阳光照耀在我的头上——第二个降生的日期终于来到。只有这时我才走进这童话，关于这点从前也只能梦想，我没注意怎样忽然踏过了半个地
  球，也没注意怎样度过了这许多时光。我曾经穿过风雪与烟火，也毫不畏惧地跨过了时代的谎言，千千万万颗无畏的心灵，培育了我的勇敢。我了解了人的伟大。我不是生在梦中，而是活在现实，我生活在一个美妙的时代，我在人类的童话中度日。关于这童话，十月前的人只能在黑暗里梦想。而我却看到，在这大地上如何升起了人类真理的曙光。
