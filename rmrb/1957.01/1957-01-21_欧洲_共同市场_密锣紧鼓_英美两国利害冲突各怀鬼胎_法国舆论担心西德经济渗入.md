Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak held preliminary talks with the British government on January 15 regarding the issue of establishing ties between Britain and the Western European "Common Market." It is reported that the treaty for establishing the "Common Market" is scheduled to be signed in Brussels on the 25th.

Spaak is the chairman of the "Government Conference" of six European countries (Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands). These six countries have been discussing the establishment of a "customs union" and the formation of a "Common Market" for some time. The plan to establish a Western European "Common Market" stipulates the gradual abolition of tariff barriers to allow for the "free movement of goods, capital, and labor" among participating countries.

Britain only recently decided to associate itself with this type of economic alliance. In early October of last year, Macmillan proposed that Britain associate itself with the emerging six-nation Western European "customs union" by participating in a so-called Western European "partial free trade area," while retaining the freedom to maintain its own relationships with countries outside the Western European region.

The United States Department of State issued a statement on January 15, expressing its welcome and support for the initiative to establish a Western European "Common Market."

The statement said that the United States is particularly concerned about aspects of the plan related to agriculture and the relaxation of import controls on goods payable in dollars. It is pointed out that the so-called agricultural aspect is the United States' attempt to use this plan to further dump surplus agricultural products into Western Europe.

On the same day, news from London stated that the reason the plan to establish a European "free trade area" was able to move Britain was that some British figures hoped that an economically self-sufficient Europe would eliminate the Old Continent's financial dependence on the United States, thus enabling European countries to break free from US policies and become more politically independent. The Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" said that the British government's "active cooperation" with the Western European "Common Market" "could provide new opportunities for leadership in Europe."

Regarding the "free trade" plan, Britain is particularly opposed to including agricultural products in the plan. Britain imports a large amount of agricultural products from Commonwealth countries, and Britain wants to maintain its "imperial preference system" with these countries.

According to a Paris dispatch, French public opinion has expressed concern about the serious consequences that the establishment of the European "Common Market" will bring to France's economy and sovereignty. Some commentators have even pointed out clearly that the abolition of tariff barriers will put many French business owners in an extremely dangerous situation due to increased competition from various countries, especially West Germany. West Germany will likely make extensive use of the French market to sell its industrial products.

In the National Assembly, the European "Common Market" plan has become the center of debate in recent days. Many members who agree with the plan in principle have expressed reservations and put forward some conditions for passing the plan. Due to the large number of people requesting to speak, the parliament had to postpone the debate to the 23rd, and possibly even to the 24th.

French Foreign Minister Pineau told the National Assembly on January 18 that the establishment of the "European Common Market" is the solution to the problems facing France. If France does not participate in this plan, it will fall into "isolation."

Pineau called on the National Assembly to "take swift action" to approve the plan, without requiring the government to put forward conditions to the participating countries, in order to promote "European unity" and deal with the "dangers around us."

### 欧洲“共同市场”密锣紧鼓  英美两国利害冲突各怀鬼胎  法国舆论担心西德经济渗入

    欧洲“共同市场”密锣紧鼓
    英美两国利害冲突各怀鬼胎
    法国舆论担心西德经济渗入
    据新华社讯　比利时外交大臣斯巴克15日同英国政府就建立英国同西欧“共同市场”的联系问题举行了初步会谈。据悉，建立“共同市场”的条约预定25日在布鲁塞尔签字。
    斯巴克是六个欧洲国家（比利时、法国、西德、意大利、卢森堡、荷兰）“政府会议”的主席。这六个国家一个时期以来一直在讨论建立一个“关税同盟”和成立“共同市场”。成立西欧“共同市场”的计划规定，逐步废除关税壁垒制度，以便使参加国的“商品、资金和劳动力自由运动”。
    英国不久以前才决定同这种经济同盟联系起来。在去年10月初，麦克米伦曾经提出过这样的主张：英国通过参加一个所谓西欧“局部自由贸易区”同正在建立的西欧六国“关税同盟”联系起来，同时英国有自由来保持它自己对于西欧地区以外的其他国家的关系。
    美国国务院15日发表声明，表示欢迎和支持建立西欧“共同市场”的倡议。
    声明说，美国特别关心这个计划里同农业有关的方面以及放宽对美元货物的入口管制方面等。据指出，所谓农业方面，就是美国企图利用这个计划进一步倾销剩余农产品到西欧。
    同一天，从伦敦传出的消息说，建立欧洲“自由贸易区”的计划所以能够打动英国，是因为英国一些人士希望经济上自给自足的欧洲将会消除旧大陆对美国财政上的依赖，这样，就会使欧洲国家的政治地位更能摆脱美国的政策而独立。保守党的“每日电讯报”说，英国政府同西欧“共同市场”的“积极合作，能够提供在欧洲领导的新机会”。
    在“自由贸易”计划方面，英国是特别反对把农产品包括在计划内的，英国从英联邦国家进口大量农产品，英国要保持同这些国家之间的“帝国优惠制”。
    另据巴黎消息，法国舆论对于成立欧洲“共同市场”将给法国的经济和主权带来的严重后果，表现了不安。有的评论员并且明白指出：废除关税壁垒制度，将使法国的许多企业主在来自各国、首先是西德的竞争日益增加的情况下，处于极为危险的境地。西德将有可能广泛地利用法国市场来销售自己的工业品。
    在国民议会里，欧洲“共同市场”计划成为近日来辩论的中心。许多在原则上赞同这个计划的议员都表示有所保留，并且提出了通过这个计划的一些条件。由于要求发言的人很多，议会不得不把辩论推迟到23日，甚至可能到24日才结束。
    法国外交部长比诺18日在国民议会上把建立“欧洲共同市场”说成是解决法国面临的问题的出路。法国如果不参加这计划，就会陷于“孤立”。
    比诺要求国民议会“迅速采取行动”，批准这个计划，而不应要求政府向各参与国提出条件，以便促进“欧洲团结”，对付“周围的危险”。
