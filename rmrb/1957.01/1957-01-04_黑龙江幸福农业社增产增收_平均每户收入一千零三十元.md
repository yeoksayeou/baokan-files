Heilongjiang Happiness Agricultural Cooperative Increases Production and Income
Average Income Per Household is One Thousand and Thirty Yuan

    (Reported by this newspaper) Since its establishment in 1953, the Happiness Agricultural Cooperative in Nenjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, has achieved bumper harvests year after year. In particular, in 1956, the first year of achieving advanced cooperativization, it achieved an all-round bumper harvest of various crops, creating a new record for high yields over large areas of dry land in the county. In 1956, the cooperative cultivated more than 611 hectares of land (excluding paddy fields). The actual harvest of 451 hectares of grain fields reached 2,200,740 jin, with an average yield per hectare increasing by more than 1,230 jin compared to 1955. In particular, the 160 hectares of wheat, all planted with the Gansu No. 96 improved variety, yielded 3,800 jin per hectare, an increase of 1,500 jin compared to the average yield of 2,300 jin per hectare in 1955.

    With the cooperative's overall bumper harvest, the income of the members also increased significantly. According to the distribution results, the total income of the cooperative was 192,234 yuan. After deducting public grain and production costs, and retaining 8% for the public accumulation fund and 1% for the public welfare fund, the net income distributed to the members was 125,925 yuan, accounting for slightly less than 66% of the total income. The total number of labor days in the cooperative in 1956 was 33,586, with an average of 3.70 yuan earned per labor day. The average income per household of the 122 cooperative members (excluding income from household sideline occupations) reached 1,030 yuan. Among them, the household with the highest income earned more than 4,600 yuan. Truly, every family has surplus grain and every household has surplus money. Even Guo's Village, which used to suffer from frequent disasters and poor harvests, also increased its income in 1956 after joining the cooperative. All 67 households in the village increased their income, except for a few who did not due to illness.

    While celebrating the first bumper harvest after cooperativization, the members thought of the strong support the state has given to the cooperative. In addition to fully paying off state loans, they also sold 1,550,000 jin of surplus grain to the state (exceeding the state's three-fix figure by 560,000 jin, or 176%) to support the country's socialist construction.

    黑龙江幸福农业社增产增收
    平均每户收入一千零三十元
    本报讯　黑龙江省嫩江县幸福农业社，从1953年建社以来，连年获得丰收；特别是1956年实现高级合作化的第一年，获得了各种作物的全面丰收，创造了全县旱田大面积高额产量的新纪录。这个社1956年耕种的六百一十一公顷多土地（水田未计算在内），其中四百五十一公顷的粮田实际收获量就达到了二百二十万零七千四百斤，每公顷的产量平均比1955年提高了一千二百三十多斤；尤其是种植的一百六十公顷小麦，全部种的是甘肃96号良种，每公顷产量提高到三千八百斤，比1955年每公顷平均产两千三百斤，多产了一千五百斤。
    随着社的全面丰产，社员们的收入也有了显著的增加。根据分配的结果，全社总收入为十九万二千二百三十四元，除去公粮和生产费用，再留8％的公积金、1％的公益金，分给社员的纯收入为十二万五千九百二十五元，占总收入的66％弱。全社1956年的总劳动日是三万三千五百八十六个，平均每个劳动日可分得三元七角钱。全社一百二十二户社员，平均每户社员收入（家庭副业收入不在内）达一千零三十元。其中收入最多的一户，在四千六百元以上。真是家家有余粮、户户有余钱。甚至连过去经常遭灾而收成不好的郭家屯，也由于1956年加入了这个社，全屯六十七户除个别户因病没有增加收入外，全都增加了收入。
    社员们在欢庆合作化后第一年的丰收声中，联想到国家给予合作社的大力支援。他们除全部交清国家贷款外，还出售给国家一百五十五万斤余粮（超过国家三定数字五十六万斤的176％），来支援国家的社会主义建设。　（蔺万良）
