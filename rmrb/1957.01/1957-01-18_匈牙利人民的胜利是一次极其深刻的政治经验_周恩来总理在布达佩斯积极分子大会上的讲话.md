    The Victory of the Hungarian People Is a Profound Political Experience
    Premier Zhou Enlai’s Speech at the Budapest Activists' Congress
    Dear Comrade Kádár, dear Comrade Dobi, dear comrades, friends:
    Recently, the Chinese people, like the people of other socialist countries and all progressive forces in the world, have been closely concerned with the arduous struggle of the Hungarian people to repel the frantic attacks of imperialism and domestic counter-revolutionaries. Now, with the help of the Soviet army, the Hungarian people have crushed the counter-revolutionary plot for restoration. The victory of this struggle proves that the Hungarian people, who have mastered their own destiny, can stand the test, and the attempt of imperialism and reactionary forces to reverse the wheels of history is definitely doomed to failure. At this moment, I am extremely excited and pleased to be able to represent the Chinese government and the Chinese people in personally extending our heartfelt congratulations and high respect to the fraternal and heroic Hungarian people.
    The Hungarian working people recognized that the counter-revolutionaries, who were waving the banner of patriotism, independence, and freedom, were by no means representatives of the Hungarian national interests, but direct successors to the Horthy fascist reign of terror.
    The Chinese people fully understand the dissatisfaction of the Hungarian people with the serious mistakes of past leaders. The demands of Hungarian workers, peasants, and intellectuals to correct these serious mistakes, to improve the socialist legal system, to soundly develop socialist democracy, and to strengthen unity and friendly cooperation with other socialist countries on the basis of national equality and mutual respect are completely justified. The purpose of these demands is not to shake the people's democratic dictatorship and the socialist system of the Hungarian People's Republic, but to more fully give play to the enormous superiority of socialist democracy to consolidate the Hungarian socialist system.
    However, as the facts have shown, while the Hungarian people were raising these legitimate demands, the imperialists and the Hungarian domestic and foreign counter-revolutionaries under their command took the opportunity to carry out their long-planned conspiracy. They took advantage of the Hungarian people's legitimate dissatisfaction to launch an armed rebellion, attempting to destroy the Hungarian people's socialist system and to restore the capitalist system and fascist reign of terror in Hungary. They also dragged some young intellectuals and working people who were unaware of the truth into their anti-people activities by using various demagogic slogans. The Nagy group at that time retreated step by step in the face of the counter-revolutionary forces, opened the way for the counter-revolutionary forces, and fell into the quagmire of counter-revolution. This caused the counter-revolutionaries to be rampant for a time, causing many communists and patriots to be brutally murdered under white terror, and the Hungarian people's socialist system and achievements were seriously threatened.
    However, the Hungarian people are, after all, a people who have suffered all kinds of hardships and have a glorious revolutionary tradition. The Hungarian working people still clearly remember the consequences of the counter-revolutionaries overthrowing the Soviet regime in Hungary in 1919. At that time, the imperialist reactionaries established Horthy's fascist dictatorship under the false slogans of "democracy and freedom." Under Horthy's reactionary rule, the Hungarian working people were subjected to cruel exploitation and oppression, a large number of patriots were massacred and persecuted, and finally, because the Horthy regime participated in Hitler's bloody adventure, Hungary was led to a national disaster. This time, the Hungarian working people have again learned through blood lessons that the counter-revolutionaries who wave the banner of patriotism, independence, and freedom are by no means representatives of the Hungarian national interests, but direct successors to the Horthy fascist reign of terror. Therefore, the patriotic people of Hungary reorganized their forces, formed the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government headed by Comrade Kádár, and with the assistance of the Soviet army, quickly crushed the heinous conspiracy of the counter-revolution.
    The victory of the Hungarian people in the struggle against the counter-revolutionary conspiracy has important significance in the world and is a great contribution to world peace.
    The victory of the Hungarian people in the struggle against the counter-revolutionary conspiracy has important significance in the world. The imperialists' conspiracy is by no means limited to realizing a counter-revolutionary restoration in Hungary, but also to open a gap from Hungary, destroy the unity of the socialist camp, and defeat all socialist countries one by one. The victory of the Hungarian people's struggle dealt a heavy blow to the imperialists' attempt to destroy the unity of the socialist camp and defeat socialist countries one by one. The victory of the Hungarian people also foiled the imperialists' conspiracy to turn Hungary into a source of war, and therefore is also a great contribution to world peace. It is precisely because of this that the struggle of the Hungarian people has received the sympathy and support of the socialist forces and all progressive forces in the world.
    The Hungarian people can count on the support of 600 million Chinese people as they undertake various arduous and glorious tasks.
    The Chinese people are very pleased to see that in Hungary, all healthy democratic forces headed by the working class are increasingly united around the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, and support the Party and government's political and economic measures. The political situation and economic life in Hungary are also gradually returning to normal. However, as the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government pointed out in its statement on January 5 regarding the most important tasks at present, there are still many arduous and complex tasks to be completed. The sabotage activities of the counter-revolutionaries have caused great losses and brought many economic difficulties. After the failure of the armed rebellion, the counter-revolutionaries are still attempting to continue their anti-people and anti-socialist activities through political incitement and creating chaos in the economy. In order to accomplish the most important tasks at present, the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government has put forward a series of necessary measures. These measures are to firmly rely on the working class and the broad masses of working people, unite all healthy forces that support socialism, strive to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, rectify and consolidate the socialist order, restore production and overcome difficulties, and educate the people to distinguish between right and wrong and between the enemy and ourselves. These measures show that the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government is determined to use all its strength to defend the achievements made in socialist construction over the past twelve years, and to systematically overcome all the mistakes that have hindered Hungary's socialist construction in the past few years. We believe that under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants’ Revolutionary Government, the Hungarian working people, headed by the working class, will certainly overcome various difficulties, quickly heal the wounds caused by the imperialists and counter-revolutionaries, and better realize the great task of socialist construction. In carrying out various arduous and glorious tasks, the Hungarian people can count on the support of 600 million Chinese people.
    The victory of the Hungarian people in repelling the attacks of imperialism and counter-revolutionaries is not only a profound political experience for the Hungarian people, but also for the people of all other socialist countries and the progressive movement throughout the world. The people of all socialist countries and the progressive humanity of the world can draw useful lessons from this event.
    The Hungarian event once again proves the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism regarding class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat. After overthrowing the rule of the exploiters, the working class must also implement revolutionary dictatorship and not be deceived by the false slogans of "democracy" and "freedom."
    The Hungarian event first of all once again proves the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism regarding class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, proving that the exploiting classes will not give up their positions without a fight, and proving that even after being overthrown, these classes will still rely on the support of imperialism to attempt to reimpose their reactionary rule on workers and peasants and working intellectuals. They have tried this in the past, and they will not give up this attempt now or in the future. In order to realize its great mission, the working class must not only overthrow the rule of the exploiters, but also suppress their resistance after overthrowing their rule, implement revolutionary dictatorship over them, and not be deceived by the false slogans of "democracy" and "freedom."
    The dictatorship of the proletariat, that is, the people's democratic dictatorship, must closely combine the dictatorship over the exploiters with the broadest democracy among the working people. Without close ties with the broad masses of working people, without their active support, there can be no dictatorship of the proletariat, or at least no consolidated dictatorship of the proletariat. To talk about "democracy" without the dictatorship of the proletariat is actually to stand on the side of the bourgeoisie and oppose the proletariat, and is actually to demand capitalism and oppose socialism.
    The past leaders of Hungary made many mistakes on the issue of people's democracy, and also made many mistakes on the issue of revolutionary dictatorship. Now, the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government has expressed its determination to resolutely correct these mistakes, and has clearly stated that the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants’ Revolutionary Government is a government of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The statement said, "In the Hungarian worker-peasant state of the dictatorship of the proletariat, democracy and freedom are given to the workers, working peasants, intellectuals loyal to the people, and all Hungarian citizens who abide by the law. Counter-revolutionaries and imperialist spies, those who attack the legitimate system of the Hungarian People's Republic and the main institutions of the Republic, and those who incite opposition to them, even if they use the slogan of democracy to cover up their counter-revolutionary activities, have not been given and cannot be given freedom. The law will always punish them most severely." This is completely correct.
    The victory of the Hungarian people also proves the importance of the unity of socialist countries, especially the friendship of the great Soviet Union. All problems in the relations between socialist countries can be resolved through friendly consultation.
    The victory of the Hungarian people also proves the importance of the unity of socialist countries, especially the importance of the friendship of the great Soviet Union for the people of other socialist countries.
    When the Hungarian people were in dire straits, when the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, representing the will of the people and the interests of the nation, requested Soviet assistance, the heroic Soviet people did not stand idly by, but sent troops to assist Hungary as they had helped the Hungarian people to gain liberation in the past. This proves the Soviet Union's loyalty to the principles of proletarian internationalism. The Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government correctly assessed in its statement of January 5 the important role played by the socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union, in helping the Hungarian people to overcome the counter-revolutionary offensive.
    In the past, there were indeed some problems to be resolved in the relations between Hungary and the Soviet Union, and these problems once hindered the normal relations between Hungary and the Soviet Union. The imperialists and counter-revolutionaries took advantage of this situation and tried their best to stir up narrow national sentiments, attempting to undermine the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. The mistakes made by socialist countries in their mutual relations in the past should be corrected, but the fraternal relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation between socialist countries is undeniably in a more important position. Moreover, all problems in the relations between socialist countries can be resolved through friendly consultation as long as the principle of national equality and the principle of proletarian internationalism are correctly combined.
    The declaration issued by the Soviet government on October 30, 1956, regarding the foundations for developing and further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, shows the Soviet Union's determination to eliminate certain abnormal phenomena in its relations with other socialist countries in the past. As far as Soviet-Hungarian relations are concerned, as the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government pointed out in its statement of January 5, most of the obstacles hindering normal relations between the two countries have been eliminated, and the existing problems will be resolved by the two countries through friendly negotiations in accordance with the friendly and fraternal alliance.
    The Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government declared that the basis of its foreign policy is the international solidarity of the working people, and the eternal alliance with the Soviet Union and all countries of the socialist camp. There is no doubt that this is not only in the interest of the Hungarian people, but also in the interest of the entire socialist camp and world peace, and the progress of all mankind.
    Imperialist aggressive forces are attacking the socialist camp and the anti-colonial national independence movement at the same time, but they are bound to fail.
    In recent times, imperialist aggressive forces have launched attacks on both the socialist camp and the anti-colonial national independence movement at the same time. Although their adventures in Hungary and Egypt have suffered shameful failures, they are not reconciled. The United States, the head of the imperialist aggressive forces, is still attempting to interfere in Hungary through the United Nations, and at the same time announced the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine," attempting to carry out economic enslavement and military intervention against the people of the Near and Middle East. These attempts at interference by the imperialists have been opposed by the broad masses of people and fair public opinion, and in the end, they are bound to fail. The recent series of events precisely proves the unprecedentedly powerful vitality of the socialist system, and also proves the irresistible force of the national independence movement. The world is definitely moving towards progress, not towards reaction. Even if the imperialist aggressive forces may be rampant for a while, they can in no way prevent the inevitable course of history.
    Comrades, friends, before I conclude my speech, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to you for the grand and thoughtful reception you have given to all members of our delegation even in the current difficult situation. This fully demonstrates the deep friendship of the Hungarian people towards the Chinese people. I would like to assure you once again that the 600 million Chinese people will always be closely united with the fraternal Hungarian people.
    Long live the Hungarian People's Republic!
    Long live the Hungarian people united to defend the socialist cause!
    Long live the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party!
    Long live the eternal and unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples!
    Long live the great unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live world peace!

    匈牙利人民的胜利是一次极其深刻的政治经验
    周恩来总理在布达佩斯积极分子大会上的讲话
    亲爱的卡达尔同志、亲爱的道比同志、亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    最近时期以来，中国人民，像其他社会主义国家的人民和世界上的一切进步力量一样，密切地关怀匈牙利人民为了击退帝国主义和国内反革命分子的猖狂进攻而进行的艰苦斗争。现在，匈牙利人民在苏联军队的帮助下，已经粉碎了反革命复辟的阴谋。这场斗争的胜利证明，掌握了自己命运的匈牙利人民是经得起考验的，帝国主义和反动势力扭转历史车轮的企图，已经肯定不能得逞了。在这个时刻，我能够代表中国政府和中国人民亲自向兄弟的英勇的匈牙利人民表示衷心的祝贺和崇高的敬意，感到无比的兴奋和愉快。
    匈牙利的劳动人民认识到打着爱国、独立、自由旗帜的反革命分子，绝不是匈牙利民族利益的代表者，而是霍尔蒂法西斯恐怖统治的直接继承人。
    中国人民完全能够理解匈牙利人民对于过去领导者的严重错误所感到的不满。匈牙利工人、农民和知识分子要求纠正这些严重错误，要求健全社会主义法制，要求健全地发展社会主义民主，要求匈牙利在民族平等和互相尊重的基础上同其他社会主义国家加强团结和友好合作，这些要求是完全正当的。这些要求的目的，不是为了动摇匈牙利人民共和国的人民民主专政和社会主义制度，而是为了更充分地发挥社会主义民主的巨大优越性来巩固匈牙利社会主义制度。
    但是，事实的经过说明，在匈牙利人民提出这些正当要求的同时，帝国主义者和在他们指使下的匈牙利国内外的反革命分子，就乘机进行了他们策划已久的阴谋活动。他们利用了匈牙利人民正当的不满情绪，发动了武装暴乱，企图摧毁匈牙利人民的社会主义制度，企图在匈牙利恢复资本主义制度和法西斯的恐怖统治。他们还通过各种煽惑人心的口号把一部分不明真象的青年知识分子和劳动人民拖进了他们反人民的勾当。当时的纳吉集团在反革命势力的进攻面前节节退让，为反革命势力开辟了道路，并且落到反革命的泥坑中去。这就造成了反革命分子的一时猖獗，使许多共产党人和爱国者在白色恐怖下惨遭杀害，使匈牙利人民的社会主义的制度和成果受到十分严重的威胁。
    但是，匈牙利人民毕竟是饱受过各种苦难和具有光荣革命传统的人民。匈牙利的劳动人民都还很清楚地记得，1919年反革命分子在匈牙利颠覆了苏维埃政权所带来的后果。当时，帝国主义反动派正是在虚伪的“民主和自由”的口号下建立了霍尔蒂的法西斯独裁。在霍尔蒂的反动统治下，匈牙利的劳动人民遭到残酷的剥削和压迫，大批爱国者遭到屠杀和迫害，最后还由于霍尔蒂政权参加了希特勒的血腥冒险而把匈牙利导向了民族灾难的境地。这次，匈牙利的劳动人民又经过血的教训而认识到，打着爱国、独立、自由的旗帜的反革命分子，绝不是匈牙利民族利益的代表者，而是霍尔蒂法西斯恐怖统治的直接继承人。因此，匈牙利的爱国人民重新整顿了自己的力量，组成了以卡达尔同志为首的社会主义工人党和工农革命政府，并且在苏联军队的协助下，迅速地粉碎了反革命的罪恶阴谋。
    匈牙利人民对反革命阴谋进行斗争的胜利，具有世界范围的重要意义，是对整个世界和平的巨大贡献。
    匈牙利人民在对反革命阴谋进行斗争中所取得的胜利，具有世界范围的重要意义。帝国主义者的阴谋决不限于在匈牙利实现反革命复辟，而且还要从匈牙利打开一个缺口，破坏社会主义阵营的团结，各个击破所有的社会主义国家。匈牙利人民斗争的胜利，使帝国主义者想破坏社会主义阵营团结和各个击破社会主义国家的企图遭到了沉重的打击。匈牙利人民的胜利也同时挫败了帝国主义者想把匈牙利变成战争策源地的阴谋，因此也是对整个世界和平的巨大贡献。正是因为这样，匈牙利人民的斗争受到了世界上社会主义力量和一切进步力量的同情和支持。
  匈牙利人民在进行各项艰巨而又光荣的任务的时候，可以指望六万万中国人民的支持。
    中国人民十分满意地看到，在匈牙利，以工人阶级为首的一切健康的民主力量越来越团结在匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的周围，支持党和政府的政治和经济措施。匈牙利的政治情况和经济生活也正在逐步地趋向正常。但是，正如匈牙利工农革命政府在1月5日就当前最主要的任务发表的声明中所指出的，目前还有许多艰巨复杂的任务需要完成。反革命分子的破坏活动造成巨大的损失，带来了经济上的许多困难。反革命分子在武装暴乱失败以后，还企图通过政治上的煽动挑拨和在经济上造成混乱的办法，继续他们反人民反社会主义的活动。为了完成当前最重要的任务，匈牙利工农革命政府已经提出了一系列必要的措施。这些措施就是坚决依靠工人阶级和广大劳动群众，团结一切拥护社会主义的健康力量，努力肃清反革命分子，整顿和巩固社会主义秩序，恢复生产和克服困难，在人民中进行分清是非和敌我的教育。这些措施说明，匈牙利工农革命政府下定决心，要用一切力量保卫过去十二年在社会主义建设中的成就，并且有步骤地克服在过去几年中阻碍匈牙利社会主义建设的一切错误。我们相信，在匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的领导下，以工人阶级为首的匈牙利劳动人民，一定会克服各种困难，迅速医治好帝国主义者和反革命分子所造成的创伤，更好地实现社会主义建设的伟大任务。在进行各项艰巨而又光荣的任务的时候，匈牙利人民可以指望六万万中国人民的支持。
    匈牙利人民击退帝国主义和反革命分子进攻的胜利不仅对于匈牙利人民，而且对于所有其他社会主义国家的人民和全世界的进步运动，都是一次极其深刻的政治经验。各社会主义国家的人民和全世界的进步人类都可以从这次事件中吸收有益的教训。
    匈牙利事件再一次证明了马克思列宁主义关于阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的基本原理。工人阶级在推翻剥削者的统治以后，还要实行革命的专政，不被虚伪的“民主”和“自由”的口号所欺骗。
    匈牙利事件首先再一次证明了马克思列宁主义关于阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的基本原理，证明了剥削阶级是不会不经过战斗就放弃自己的阵地的，证明了这些阶级甚至在被推翻以后，还要依靠帝国主义的支持企图重新把他们的反动统治加在工人和农民和劳动知识分子的身上。他们过去这样尝试过，现在和将来也不会放弃这种企图。工人阶级为了实现自己伟大使命就不仅要推翻剥削者的统治，而且还要在推翻了他们的统治之后镇压他们的反抗，对他们实行革命的专政，不被虚伪的“民主”和“自由”的口号所欺骗。
    无产阶级专政，也就是人民民主专政，必须把对剥削者的专政同劳动人民中最广泛的民主紧密结合起来。离开了同广大劳动人民的密切联系，离开了他们的积极支持，就不能有无产阶级专政，至少不可能有巩固的无产阶级专政。离开了无产阶级专政而高谈“民主”，实际上是站在资产阶级方面而反对无产阶级，实际上是要求资本主义而反对社会主义。
    匈牙利过去的领导者在人民民主的问题上犯了许多错误，在革命专政的问题上也犯了许多错误。现在，匈牙利工农革命政府已经表示决心，要坚决纠正这些错误，并且明确地声明，匈牙利工农革命政府是无产阶级专政的政府。声明中说，“在无产阶级专政的匈牙利工农国家里，民主和自由是给予工人、劳动农民、忠于人民的知识分子和遵守法律的全体匈牙利公民的。反革命分子和帝国主义间谍，进攻匈牙利人民共和国合法制度和共和国主要机构、煽动反对它们的那些分子，即使他们用民主的口号来掩饰自己的反革命活动，没有而且也不可能给他们自由。法律将永远最严厉地制裁他们。”这是完全正确的。
    匈牙利人民的胜利还证明了社会主义各国团结一致、特别是伟大苏联的友谊的重要性。社会主义各国相互关系方面的一切问题，都是可以通过友好协商求得解决的。
    匈牙利人民的胜利，还证明了社会主义各国团结一致的重要性，特别是伟大的苏联的友谊对于其他社会主义各国人民的重要性。
    当匈牙利人民处在水深火热的灾难中，当代表人民意志和民族利益的匈牙利工农革命政府要求苏联援助的时候，英勇的苏联人民并没有就此旁观，而是像过去帮助匈牙利人民获得解放一样地派出军队来援助匈牙利。这证明了苏联对于无产阶级国际主义原则的忠诚，匈牙利工农革命政府在1月5日发表的声明中正确地估价了各社会主义国家，特别是苏联，在帮助匈牙利人民战胜反革命的进攻方面所起的重要作用。
    过去在匈牙利和苏联之间的关系上的确存在着一些有待解决的问题，这些问题曾经妨碍了匈牙利和苏联的正常关系。帝国主义者和反革命分子利用了这种情况，竭力挑起狭隘的民族情绪，企图破坏以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结。社会主义各国过去在相互关系方面的错误是应该改正的，但是社会主义国家之间兄弟式的互助合作关系，却无可争辩地处于更加重要的地位。而且，社会主义各国在相互关系方面的一切问题，只要按照民族平等的原则和无产阶级国际主义的原则两者正确相结合的方针，都是可以通过友好协商求得解决的。
    苏联政府在1956年10月30日发表的关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言，说明苏联决心消除过去同其他社会主义国家的关系中的某些不正常的现象。就苏匈两国关系来说，正如匈牙利工农革命政府在1月5日的声明中所指出的，妨碍两国正常关系的大部分障碍已经消除，而现在存在的问题，两国将按照友好的、兄弟般的同盟关系，通过友好谈判来解决。
    匈牙利工农革命政府声明，它的外交政策的基础是劳动者的国际团结，是同苏联和社会主义阵营一切国家的永恒联盟。毫无疑问，这不仅符合于匈牙利人民的利益，也符合于整个社会主义阵营和世界和平、全人类进步的利益。
    帝国主义侵略势力正在同时进攻社会主义阵营和反殖民主义的民族独立运动，但是他们必然要遭到失败。
    最近一个时期以来，帝国主义侵略势力对社会主义阵营和反殖民主义的民族独立运动同时发动了进攻。尽管他们在匈牙利和埃及的冒险都遭到了可耻的失败，但是他们并不甘心。帝国主义侵略势力的首脑美国，还在企图通过联合国对匈牙利进行干涉，同时宣布了所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”，企图对中近东人民进行经济奴役和军事干涉。帝国主义者的这些干涉企图，已经遭到广大人民和公正舆论的反对，最后，也必然要遭到失败。最近一系列的事件，恰好证明了社会主义制度空前强大的生命力，也证明了民族独立运动的不可阻挡的力量。世界肯定地走向进步，而不是走向反动。帝国主义侵略势力即使可能有一时的猖獗，但是无论如何也阻止不了历史的必然进程。
    同志们、朋友们，在我结束我的讲话以前，我要向你们表示衷心的感谢，感谢你们即使在目前的困难情况下仍然给予我们代表团全体人员的隆重而周到的接待。这充分地说明了匈牙利人民对中国人民的深厚友谊。我愿意再一次向你们保证，六万万中国人民将永远同兄弟的匈牙利人民紧密地团结在一起。
    匈牙利人民共和国万岁！
    团结起来保卫社会主义事业的匈牙利人民万岁！
    匈牙利社会主义工人党万岁！
    中匈两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的兄弟友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义国家的伟大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
