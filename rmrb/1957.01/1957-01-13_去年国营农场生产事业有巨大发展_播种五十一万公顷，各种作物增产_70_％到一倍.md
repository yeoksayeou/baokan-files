Xinhua News Agency, 12th: In 1956, the growth rate of more than 450 national state farms across the country in terms of land reclamation, sown area, and output exceeded any year since national liberation.

Due to the active measures taken by state farms to sow crops on newly reclaimed wasteland and increase the multiple cropping index, the sown area reached 510,000 hectares, an increase of 80% compared to 1955. The increase in the yield of various crops increased by 70% to 100% compared to 1955. Compared with the production level of national agricultural cooperatives, the tremendous advantages of state farms in using large-scale collective management and machine cultivation, and adopting advanced technical measures in cultivation, are even more evident. According to statistics from the Ministry of Land Reclamation, the average yield of grain crops on national state farms last year exceeded that of national agricultural cooperatives by 12%, and cotton production exceeded it by 69%.

Among the total sown area of state farms, grain crops account for 60%, and the rest are economic crops such as soybeans, cotton, sugarcane, and rubber.

In 1956, the total area of wasteland reclaimed by state farms across the country reached 350,000 hectares, a figure exceeding the total area of wasteland reclaimed in the past three years. Some of these reclaimed wastelands were sown with rice and other crops that year and yielded good harvests.

The production of live pigs in national state farms also developed greatly last year. It is understood that the total number of live pigs in national state farms has reached 330,000, with an average of more than one pig per farm worker. The planned development of pig production not only helps people solve the problem of meat consumption, but also provides a large amount of fertilizer for farms, increasing a lot of income.

    去年国营农场生产事业有巨大发展
    播种五十一万公顷，各种作物增产70％到一倍
    新华社12日讯　1956年全国四百五十多个国营农场，在开荒、播种面积和产量等方面的增长速度，都超过了全国解放以来的任何一年。
    由于各国营农场积极采取了在当年开垦的荒地上播种和提高复种指数的措施，使播种面积达到了五十一万公顷，比1955年增长了80％，而各种作物产量的增长幅度，又比1955年提高了70％到一倍。如果同全国农业社的生产水平比较，就更看得出国营农场运用大面积集体经营和机器耕种以及在耕种中采用先进技术措施的巨大优越性。据农垦部的统计，去年全国国营农场粮食作物的平均产量超过全国农业社12％，棉花的产量超过69％。
    在国营农场的全部播种面积中，粮食作物要占到60％，其他都是种植的大豆、棉花、甘蔗和橡胶等经济作物。
    1956年全国国营农场开垦荒地的总面积达到三十五万公顷，这个数字超过过去三年所开垦的荒地面积的总和。在这些开垦的荒地中有一部分在当年就播种了稻谷和其他作物，并且收成很好。
    全国国营农场的生猪生产工作，在去年也有很大发展。据了解，现在全国国营农场拥有生猪的总数已达到三十三万头，平均每个农场职工有一头以上。有计划的发展生猪生产，不仅帮助人民解决肉食问题，还为农场提供大量肥料，增加了很多收入。
