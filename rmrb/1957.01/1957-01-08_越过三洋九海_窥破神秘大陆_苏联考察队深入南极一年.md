Xinhua News Agency, January 7th, via TASS, "Peace Village," Antarctica, January 5th: It has been a year since the Soviet diesel-electric ship "Ob" first appeared in the unexplored Antarctic continent, having traversed three oceans and nine seas. Now, guided by an "Il-12" aircraft, the "Ob" is approaching Antarctica for the second time.

In the past year, the expedition established the Antarctic Scientific Center of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the modern "Peace Village" geophysical observation station, amidst the ice and snow.

The expedition surveyed this vast oasis. The sled convoys carrying the expedition members, unprecedentedly towed by tractors, braved blizzards and headed into the heart of Antarctica, establishing the "Young Pioneer" scientific station.

Despite the astonishingly harsh climate, the scientists here conducted extensive and important scientific research on a total of fifteen projects this year. It is extremely difficult to list all the most interesting data collected over the past year. The researchers have learned much about the past and present geological conditions of this mysterious, ice-covered continent, its fauna and flora, atmospheric effects, and ice conditions.

Scientists, along with the expedition's flight personnel, have made many corrections to the map of the "Truth" coast.

Now, a new group of Soviet expedition members has begun the second part of the exploration plan, preparing to establish the "Vostok" and "Soviet" scientific stations. A large sledge convoy pulled by tractors has already penetrated two hundred kilometers into the interior, continuing towards the "Young Pioneer" scientific station, which will be used as an intermediate support base. A group of researchers measuring the thickness of the high-altitude ice sheet on the continent is conducting interesting explorations in various inland regions. Construction workers arriving on the "Ob" have begun building warm houses for those preparing to overwinter at the "Vostok" scientific station at the South Geomagnetic Pole.

    越过三洋九海　窥破神秘大陆
    苏联考察队深入南极一年
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社南极“和平村”5日讯：自从苏联柴油电动船“鄂毕号”经过三个大洋和九个海面，第一次出现在未经勘测的南极洲以来，已经一年。现在“鄂毕号”又在由一架“伊尔十二式”飞机引导下第二次驶近南极。
    过去一年中，考察队在冰天雪地中建立了苏联科学院的南极科学中心，现代化的“和平村”地球物理观察站。
    考察队勘测了这块巨大的绿洲，载着考察队的雪撬车队并且史无前例地在拖拉机的拖曳下冒着大风雪走向南极洲的腹地，建立了“少年先锋”科学站。
    尽管气候恶劣到惊人的程度，这里的科学家们在这一年中一共就十五种项目进行了广泛和重要的科学研究工作。要想列举在过去一年中所搜集的最有趣的资料是十分困难的。考察人员已经了解到许多关于这个被冰雪复盖着的神秘大陆过去和现在的地质情况，它的动物区系和植物区系，大气作用和冰层的情况。
    科学家们同考察队的飞行人员一道对“真理”海岸的地图作了许多修正。
    现在，一批新的苏联考察人员已经在开始进行考察计划第二部分的工作，准备建立“东方”和“苏维埃”科学站。一列由拖拉机牵引的大型雪橇车队已经深入腹地两百公里，继续向“少年先锋”科学站前进，这个科学站将被作为一个中间的辅助基地。一批测量这个大陆的高地冰层厚度的考察人员正在各腹地地区进行有趣的考察。乘“鄂毕号”到达的建筑工作者们已经开始替准备在南地磁极的“东方”科学站过冬的人们建立温暖的房屋。
