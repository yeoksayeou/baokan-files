    Don't Just Compare to Pre-Liberation
    In newspapers, to illustrate the progress of a certain aspect of our country's construction or the growth of some kind of industrial production, comparisons are often made between the present and pre-liberation, allowing people to see the speed and scale of socialist construction. This is very good. However, the level before liberation was very backward. I suggest that in addition to comparing with pre-liberation, we should also compare with the levels of other socialist countries and even capitalist countries. This would not only allow us to see the speed of development of our cause and inspire people, but also spur people to strive to catch up with the advanced levels of all countries in the world.

    不要只同解放前比
    报纸上为说明我国某项建设的进展或某种工业生产的增长，常常拿现在来同解放前对比，使人看到社会主义建设的速度和规模，这是很好的。但是解放前的水平是很落后的。我建议除了同解放前比，还要同其他社会主义国家甚至资本主义国家的水平比较。这样不但可以看出我们事业发展的速度，使人受到鼓舞，而且可以鞭策人们为赶上世界各国的先进水平而奋斗。
