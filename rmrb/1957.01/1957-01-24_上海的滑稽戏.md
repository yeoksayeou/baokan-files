    The youngest genre of Chinese opera, "comedy," is currently entering a thriving stage.

    This genre has a very large audience in Shanghai. The theaters showing comedies are almost always full, and some productions have been running continuously for several months with consistently strong ticket sales. The currently playing "Living Bodhisattva" has been running for a year and nine months continuously, a box office record unprecedented in the history of Chinese stage.

    Comedy developed from popular spoken drama and stand-up comedy performers absorbing folk storytelling from the Jiangnan region, and has only become a genre in the last ten years or so. Its scripts are mostly taken from social anecdotes and humorous folk tales.

    In mid-January, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture and the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Dramatists Association jointly held a popular spoken drama and comedy performance, in which all thirteen comedy troupes in Shanghai participated, performing fifteen comedies and the predecessor of comedy – stand-up comedy. The "Sanmao Engages in Business" performed by the Dazhong Troupe was one of the most warmly welcomed by the audience, especially the actor Wen Binbin, who played "Sanmao," whose unique performance style was unanimously praised. The "Sanmao" in the play is a kind and good person, but in the old society, bad luck always fell on him. Wen Binbin cleverly used witty language and exaggerated movements to vividly perform the despicable and ridiculous social aspects of the time. This play made the audience laugh countless times. But by the time the show ended, the audience was recalling and discussing the suffering of the exploited in the old society.

    The "Suzhou Two Constables," adapted by the Dagong Troupe from the Min opera "Refining the Seal," the actors not only maintained the original interesting plot, but also used more than ten kinds of tunes and dialects from various parts of Jiangnan to intersperse many jokes, creating a great comedic effect.

    This genre, which is good at performing comedies, farces, and satires, was previously considered "low taste" on the one hand, but on the other hand, many audiences loved it very much. After the liberation of Shanghai, the artists formed their own troupes and made some reforms in their performances. Recently, famous film directors Ying Yunwei and Shi Hui, and cartoonist Zhang Leping, have been helping them with directing and screenwriting work and designing character images. Lu Xun's famous novel "The True Story of Ah Q" and Lao She's new work "Looking West to Chang'an" have also been adapted into comedies.

    上海的滑稽戏
    中国戏曲艺术中最年轻的一个剧种“滑稽剧”，目前正在走上欣欣向荣的阶段。
    这个剧种在上海拥有极大数量的观众。上演滑稽剧的几家剧院几乎经常满座，有些剧目连续上演了好几个月卖座始终不衰。目前还在公演的“活菩萨”，曾经连续演了一年九个月，这样的卖座纪录在中国舞台史上是没有的。
    滑稽剧是通俗话剧滑稽演员吸收江南一带的民间说唱发展起来的，成为一种剧种才不过是最近十多年的事情。它的剧本大都取材于社会奇闻和滑稽有趣的民间故事。
    1月中旬，上海市文化局和中国戏剧家协会上海分会联合举办的通俗话剧、滑稽剧观摩演出中，上海十三个滑稽剧团全部参加演出了十五出滑稽剧和滑稽剧的前身——独脚戏。大众剧团演出的“三毛学生意”是博得观众最热烈欢迎的一个剧目，特别是饰演“三毛”的演员文彬彬，独特的表演手法受到一致好评。剧中的“三毛”是个善良好人，但是在旧社会中倒霉的事情总轮到他的头上。文彬彬却用俏皮的语言和夸张的动作，巧妙地把当时卑鄙可笑的社会相表演得淋漓尽致。这一出戏就让观众哄堂大笑了无数次。但是到散场的时候，观众却都在回忆和谈论旧社会中被剥削者的痛苦。
    大公剧团根据闽戏“炼印”改编的“苏州二公差”，演员们不仅保持了原来有趣的情节，并且运用十多种江南各地的曲调和方言穿插了许多笑料，造成了极大的喜剧效果。
    善于演喜剧、闹剧、讽刺剧的这个剧种，过去一方面被认为是“低级趣味”的，另一方面却有很多观众十分喜爱它。上海解放以后，艺人们组成了自己的剧团，并且在演出中作了一些改革。最近，著名的电影导演应云卫、石挥和漫画家张乐平等人都在帮助他们进行编导工作和设计角色形象，鲁迅的著名小说“阿Q正传”，老舍的新作“西望长安”，也都被改编成滑稽剧演出。（新华社）
