Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhu Jigong reports: Researchers at the North China Agricultural Science Institute have initially provided some methods for how to raise pigs collectively in rural areas.

Huang Daqi, who is in charge of this research work, has just returned from Dingxian. For more than two years, they have assisted the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Dingxian County, Hebei Province, a famous pig-producing area, in establishing collective pig farms, and have explored a set of experiences in developing collective pig farming. Based on the results of practice, they have also created a collective pig farming operation table. This operation table is marked with months and the twenty-four solar terms that farmers are accustomed to. According to local climatic conditions and agricultural production characteristics, the production links of each collective pig raising are indicated on the operation table.

Regarding how to open up feed sources, the operation table has detailed arrangements. For example, before the vernal equinox, it is required to comprehensively formulate rotation, intercropping, and stubble cropping plans on the feed base to fully utilize land fertility. Small ridges five feet wide can be vertically cut into two parts, a larger and a smaller one. At the vernal equinox, plant spring cabbage and spring spinach on the larger part, and plant wax gourds on the smaller part during the Grain Rain season. When the wax gourd seedlings grow and need more ground, the spring cabbage and spring spinach can be harvested. After the wax gourds are harvested, autumn cabbage, carrots, etc. can be planted on this land. These methods not only increase the yield per unit area but also enable the pigs to eat green and juicy feed all year round.

Daily management is also an important aspect. The table indicates that pigs are prone to poisoning during the hottest days of summer, so it is necessary to frequently seek out damp areas, set up sheds, and provide sufficient drinking water. From the Grain in Ear to the End of Heat, there is a lot of rainfall, and the incidence of dysentery and scabies in piglets is high, so it is necessary to drain the accumulated water in the farm, flatten the sewage pits, and often raise the pen and add soil. Keep warm in winter, and pay special attention to sows that are about to give birth and piglets before and after weaning. In spring and autumn, preventive injections of swine fever, swine erysipelas, and swine plague should also be carried out.

Agricultural scientific workers such as Huang Daqi have also gained some experience in pig farm design. The pig farm model they designed has been exhibited at the Hebei Provincial Agricultural Exhibition.

The five kinds of pig-raising utensils they created are also popular among farmers. The automatic water dispenser made of discarded iron barrels allows water to flow out automatically from the side of the barrel as long as the pig's mouth touches it, which is both clean and convenient. The combined neck and mouth pig stick is used during pig vaccination to solve the difficulty of catching pigs. There is also a disc-shaped divided feeding trough. The feed is poured down from the middle and distributed in the divided feeding troughs. When feeding, each feeding trough can only hold one piglet, so there will be no competition for food, and feed will not be wasted.

Huang Daqi said: The experience they provide is only based on the specific situation of Dingxian County, Hebei, and is not very complete, but as a method for collective pig raising in agricultural cooperatives, it is generally useful.

    怎样在农村中集体养猪？
    华北农业科学研究所研究人员初步摸到了一些办法
    新华社13日电　新华社记者朱继功报道：华北农业科学研究所的研究人员初步提供了一些怎样在农村中集体养猪的办法。
    负责这项研究工作的黄大器，刚从定县回来。两年多来，他们协助著名猪种产地——河北省定县的五星农业社建立集体养猪场，摸索了一套发展集体养猪的经验。他们并且根据实践的结果，制成了一种集体养猪作业表。这种作业表上面标有月份和农民所习惯的二十四个节令。根据当地气候条件和农业生产特点，在作业表上指明每个集体养猪的生产环节。
    关于怎样开辟饲料来源，作业表上就有详细的安排，例如春分前，在饲料基地上要求全面地制定轮作、间作和茬作计划，充分利用地力。可以将五尺宽的小畦纵割成大小两片，春分时在大的一片上种春白菜和春菠菜，到谷雨时节在小的一片上种北瓜。待北瓜幼苗成长需要更大的地面时，春白菜和春菠菜就可收获了，当北瓜收获后，接着在这块地上茬作大白菜、胡萝卜等等。这些办法既增加单位面积产量，又使猪群能终年吃到青绿多汁的饲料。
    日常管理工作也是个重要方面。表上指明：三伏天猪群容易中毒，必须经常寻水湿地，设凉棚，供给足够的饮水。芒种到处暑，雨量大，仔猪的痢疾和疥癣发病率高，应该排除场内积水，铺平污池坑，常常起圈垫土。冬季保暖，对将分娩的母猪和离乳前后的仔猪要格外注意，春秋季还要进行猪瘟、猪丹毒和猪肺疫的预防注射工作。
    黄大器等农业科学工作者对于猪场设计也取得了一些经验。他们设计的猪场模型曾经在河北省农业展览会上展出过。
    他们创制的五种养猪用具，也受农家的欢迎。用废铁桶做成的自动饮水器，只要猪的嘴一顶，水就能自动地从桶旁流出来，既清洁又方便。颈嘴联合套猪棍在猪的预防注射时使用，可以解除抓猪的困难。还有个圆盘形的分格食槽，饲料从中间倒下去，就分散在分格食槽里，进食时候，每个分槽只能容纳一头小猪，所以不会相互争食，浪费饲料。
    黄大器说：他们提供的这些经验只是根据河北定县的具体情况摸索出来的，不很完整，但是作为在农业社内进行集体养猪的一种办法，一般还是有用的。
