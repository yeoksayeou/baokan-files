    A Frugal and Thrifty Old Engineer
    Liu Kuihua
    In the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, there is a 53-year-old engineer named Wang Chuanjue. During the construction of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, he traveled over mountains and rivers, sparing no effort to find sections of lines in the remote mountains, improving the original design and saving the country more than 2.5 million yuan in funds.
    This veteran engineer, Wang Chuanjue, with 26 years of railway construction experience, was, along with other line engineers, traveling in the dense mountains and forests of Fujian Province, inspecting and appraising the line design of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway. Wang Chuanjue used his many years of work experience to survey and design, not willing to easily let go of a stream or valley. Whenever he walked through a construction site, he always carefully observed: Where is the best place to build the railway—economical and sturdy?
    One day, Wang Chuanjue came to the construction site near Dayuan Village in the Wuyi Mountains. At that time, in this 15-kilometer section, they were preparing to build a large tunnel 606 meters long, and also planned to excavate and fill more than 300,000 cubic meters of earth to build a station, having to split open several mountain peaks. Obviously, this was a huge engineering complex. Wang Chuanjue was immediately attracted to it. He calculated: excavating such a long tunnel would require two or three hundred soldiers and workers, working hard in the dark mountain cave for more than two hundred days, and how much money would so much earth filling and excavation work cost! Was it necessary to build the railway in this place? Then, he remembered that when he set out, the line engineer, Captain Tang Chuyuan, had talked about a comparative line design, which had fewer engineering quantities, could reduce the excavation of a long tunnel, and reduce some filling and excavation work. However, that line design had problems: it had to build a bridge as high as a thirteen-story building on the Futun River, and the line was 31.4 kilometers longer, so it was abandoned by the design department. Wang Chuanjue thought to himself, no matter if it has problems or not, let's take a look first. He invited a geological engineer who was on the same route to take a look at the geological conditions there.
    They walked downstream along the comparative line on the right bank of the Futun River. This line extended southward along the gently sloping bank. Wang Chuanjue praised this line as excellent while walking. But when they reached Yanjiace, the line crossed the Futun River and extended southeastward. They opened the design drawing and saw that it said they wanted to build a thirteen-story high bridge in this place! So Wang Chuanjue thought, if the line continued along the creek, wouldn't it be unnecessary to build a big bridge at all? They looked southward along the creek. In front of them, the mountains were undulating, and there was not even a rugged path. But the old engineer was not discouraged. Based on his many years of railway construction experience, he believed that in remote areas with sparse population, he might be able to find a better line. They decided to continue looking southward along the creek.
    The weather in the south in June and July was really hot. Wang Chuanjue and the geological engineer sweated profusely as they walked. The two of them went around the valley, and the sun was already setting. They had come out after eating breakfast, and they had not had lunch. The geological engineer could not stand it and went back first. Although Wang Chuanjue's stomach was also starving, he became more and more energetic as he walked. When the sun was about to set, he suddenly saw surveying red flags waving on the opposite bank of the creek. It turned out that the abandoned comparative line crossed the creek at Yanjiace and extended southeastward; and the adopted line—that is, the line that was to carry out huge projects in the Dayuan Village area of the Wuyi Mountains—bypassed the undulating mountains and came here. He was extremely happy. He discovered a new line, which did not require a huge project in the Dayuan Village area, but only needed to follow the abandoned comparative line, that is, walk along the creek of the Futun River for half the distance, and then pass through the valley he had walked through, and it would meet with the adopted line.
    Soon, he, together with some experts and technical personnel from the design department, thoroughly inspected this newly discovered line, and, together with the technical personnel from the design department, carried out surveying and alignment. From indoors to the field, he worked until late at night every day, and in just over four days, he measured this section of the line. According to this line, more than 1.9 million yuan was saved compared with the originally designed engineering line, and the construction period was shortened by more than two months.
    This is just one example of Wang Chuanjue's work. During the year and a half that Wang Chuanjue was building the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, he ran through the mountains for more than 160 days, traveled more than 600 kilometers of lines, and successively proposed and adopted ten rationalization proposals for improving line and roadbed slope designs, saving the country a total of more than 2.5 million yuan in construction funds.

    一位勤俭节约的老工程师
    刘葵华
    在中国人民解放军铁道兵部队里，有一位五十三岁的工程师，名叫王传爵。他在修建鹰厦铁路当中，跋山涉水，不辞辛劳，从荒山僻岭中找出一段段线路，改善原来的设计，共为国家节省了二百五十多万元的资金。
    这位有着二十六年铁路建筑经验的老年工程师王传爵，是和其他线路工程师一起，奔波在福建省的丛山密林中，检查和鉴定鹰厦铁路的线路设计的。王传爵用他多年的工作经验来勘察设计，一涧一谷也不肯轻易放过。每当走过一段工地的时候，他总是仔细地留意着：到底把铁路修建在什么地方好——又省钱，又牢固？
    有一天，王传爵来到武夷山区大源村一带的工地上，当时，在这个长十五公里的地段上，正准备修建一座长六百零六公尺的大隧道，还准备挖、填三十多万立方公尺土修建一个车站，要劈开几座山头。显然这是一个巨大的工程群。王传爵立刻被它吸引住了。他计算了一下：开挖这样一座长隧道，要两三百名战士和民工，在阴暗的山洞里进行二百多天的紧张劳动，而且这么多这么大的填挖工程，要用掉多少钱啊！难道铁路非修在这个地方不行吗？于是，他沿着线路走，越走越觉得在这么短的里程内，修建这样多的大工程是不合算的。他想起来了，在出发的时候，线路工程师唐楚沅大尉谈过这里曾经有一条设计比较线路，工程数量少些，可以少挖一座长隧道，可以减少一些填、挖方工程，但是那条线路设计有毛病，它必须在富屯溪上修建一座像十三层楼那么高的大桥，线路也长三十一点四公里，因此被设计部门放弃了。王传爵心里想道，不管它有没有毛病，先看看再说。他约了一位同路的地质工程师，跟他一起看看那里的地质情况。
    他们顺着富屯溪右岸的比较线向下游走去。这条线路一直沿着坡度很小的岸边向南伸进。王传爵一边走一边赞叹这条线路好极了。可是当他们走到严家册地方的时候，线路却在这里跨富屯溪向东南伸进了。他们翻开了设计图一看，原来就是说要在这个地方修建一座十三层楼高的大桥呀！于是王传爵想，如果线路继续沿着溪水向前去，那不就根本用不着修大桥了吗？他们顺着溪流向南望去，前面山峦起伏，连一条崎岖小道也没有。但是老工程师不泄气，他根据多年修建铁路的经验，认为在人烟稀少的偏僻地带，说不定也能找出一条更好的线路来。他们决定继续沿着溪边向南看去。
    南方的六、七月天气，可真够热的，王传爵和那位地质工程师，走一步一把汗。他们两人绕过山谷，太阳已经偏西了。他们是吃了早饭出来的，午饭也没吃。地质工程师支持不住，便先回去了。王传爵肚子虽然也饿得慌，却越走越精神焕发。在太阳将要落山的时候，他突然望见溪流的对岸有飘展着的测线红旗。原来，放弃的那条比较线在严家册那里跨过溪流，向东南伸展去；而采用的那条线路——即准备在武夷山区大源村一带进行浩大工程的那条线路，却绕过起伏的山岭，来到了这里。他高兴极了。他发现了一条新线路，这条线路不必在大源村一带进行浩大的工程，而只要沿着被放弃的比较线，即沿着富屯溪的溪流走半段，再穿过他走过来的山谷，就跟采用的那条线路正好接头了。
    不久，他就同一些专家和设计部门的技术人员详细地察勘了这段新发现的线路，并且和设计部门的技术人员一起进行测量定线。他从室内到野外，每天都工作到夜深，四天多就把这段线路测好了。按照这段线路修建，比原来设计的工程线路节省了一百九十多万元，并且缩短工期两个多月。
    这只是王传爵工作中的一个事例。王传爵在修建鹰厦铁路的一年半时间中，共在崇山峻岭间奔跑了一百六十多天，走过了六百多公里的线路，先后提出并被采纳了的关于改善线路和路基边坡设计的合理化建议十件，共为国家节省建设资金二百五十多万元。
