Xinhua News Agency, January 16th, New York: At the United Nations General Assembly Trusteeship Council meeting on January 15th, the Yemeni representative strongly condemned Britain's colonial occupation of Aden and Britain's acts of aggression against Yemen.

The Yemeni representative, Jiang Manti, said: "Aden and its surrounding territories are an integral part of the Kingdom of Yemen." He pointed out that Britain's occupation of Aden was an act of aggression against Yemen, and he demanded that Britain and Yemen resolve this issue directly, stating that if the issue could not be resolved, Yemen would submit the Aden issue to the United Nations. Jiang Manti pointed out that Britain, several years ago, used "cunning diplomacy and threats of force" to force the Yemeni government to sign a vague treaty, thereby gaining control over Aden. He said, "This treaty cannot be considered valid internationally, and it has never been recognized by Yemen."

Jiang Manti said, "Yemen has never recognized foreign rule in Aden, including British rule." He pointed out that Britain's actions were in violation of international law and the United Nations Charter.

Jiang Manti accused "the British government of now pursuing a policy of force in Aden and Cyprus, and of trampling on the right to national self-determination."

Jiang Manti also pointed out that Britain was attempting to organize a federation against the will of the people in order to extend its influence into southern Yemen. He said, "This is a new method of colonialism, aimed at strengthening British control over the region."

At the meeting that day, the Spanish representative also raised the issue of Britain's occupation of Gibraltar. Representatives from Argentina and Chile accused Britain of occupying the Falkland Islands. Representatives from Indonesia and India also protested at the meeting against the Netherlands' continued occupation of West Irian.

Xinhua News Agency, January 16th, Cairo: The Yemeni government suggested on January 15th that a referendum be held in the Aden Protectorate, supervised by the United Nations, to decide Aden's political future.

The Yemeni Minister to Egypt, Talib, told reporters that his government believed such a referendum was the best way to finally resolve the dispute between Britain and Yemen. The dispute has caused fierce border clashes in recent weeks. Talib said that the British offensive on the southern end of Yemen was still continuing on the 14th, with British Royal Air Force planes and British tanks attacking Harib inside Yemen all day on the 14th.

The so-called Aden Protectorate, which Britain uses to attack the Yemeni border, was originally part of Yemeni territory. This land, divided into eastern and western parts, covers 110,000 square miles, larger than the current Yemeni mainland, and was seized by Britain from Yemen over time. The Yemeni government has never agreed to cede these territories and has repeatedly demanded that Britain return them.

Talib said that his government was willing to accept the results of a referendum held in the protectorate, as long as it was guided by a neutral committee appointed by the United Nations.

Talib said that the issue of British aggression on the border could not be discussed between Yemen and the government of the British Aden Protectorate. He said: "Such an important issue must be discussed by our government and the British government in London. We will never discuss such issues with the Aden government."

Talib also said that the issue was much more important than merely demarcating borders. He pointed out: "The major issue lies in the political future of these protectorates and the necessity of granting those people the right to self-determination. That is why we believe this issue can be resolved through a referendum, rather than by a boundary commission."

    也门代表在联大托委会会议上
    指责英国占领亚丁侵略也门
    建议举行公民投票决定亚丁政治前途
    新华社16日讯　纽约消息：在联合国大会托管委员会15日会议上，也门代表强烈谴责英国对亚丁的殖民占领、英国对也门的侵略行为。
    也门代表疆曼蒂说：“亚丁和它的周围领土是也门王国的一个组成部分。”他指出英国占领亚丁是对也门的一种侵略行为，他要求英国同也门双方直接来解决这个问题，并且表示如果这个问题不能获得解决，也门将把亚丁问题提交联合国。疆曼蒂指出，英国在若干年前利用“狡猾的外交和威力威胁”迫使也门政府签订一个含糊的条约从而获得对亚丁的统治权，他说，“这个条约在国际上不能被认为是有效的，它从来没有受到也门的承认”。
    疆曼蒂说，“也门从来没有承认在亚丁的外国统治，包括英国统治在内。”他指出英国的行为是违反国际公法和联合国宪章的。
    疆曼蒂指责“英国政府现在正在亚丁和塞浦路斯执行武力政策，并且正在蹂躏民族自决权利”。
    疆曼蒂还指出，英国正在企图组织一个违反人民意志的联邦，以便把自己的势力扩充到也门南部来，他说：“这是一种新的殖民主义方法，目的是想加强英国对这个地区的控制。”
    在这天会议上，还有西班牙代表提出了英国占领直布罗陀的问题。阿根廷和智利代表指责英国占领福克兰群岛。印度尼西亚和印度代表也在会上对荷兰继续占领西伊里安提出抗议。
    新华社16日讯　开罗消息：也门政府15日建议在亚丁保护地举行由联合国监督的公民投票来决定亚丁的政治前途。
    也门驻埃及公使塔列布对报界说，他的政府认为这种公民投票是最后解决英国同也门的纠纷的最好办法。这种纠纷在最近几个星期中引起了激烈的边境冲突。塔列布说，英国对也门南端的进攻14日还在继续，14日英国皇家空军飞机和英国坦克整天都在攻击也门境内的哈里布。
    英国用来进攻也门边境的所谓亚丁保护地，本来是也门领土的一部分。这块土地分东、西两部分，共有十一万平方英里，比现在的也门本土还要大，它是英国先后从也门手里夺走的。也门政府从来没有同意割让这些领土，并且曾经屡次要求英国归还。
    塔列布说，他的政府愿意接受在这个保护地举行的公民投票的结果，只要这种公民投票是由联合国任命的一个中立委员会来指导的。
    塔列布说，也门和英国亚丁保护地政府之间不能讨论英国侵略边境的问题。他说：“这样重要的问题必须由我们的政府和伦敦的英国政府来讨论。我们决不同亚丁政府讨论这种问题。”
    塔列布还说，这个问题比仅仅是划分疆界的问题重要得多。他指出：“重大的问题在于这些保护地的政治前途和给予那些人民以自决权的必要性。这就是我们所以认为这个问题可以通过公民投票来解决，而不是由分界委员会来解决的原因。”
