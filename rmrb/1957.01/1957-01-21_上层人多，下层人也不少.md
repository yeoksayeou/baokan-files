Many People at the Top, and Not Few at the Bottom
Jin Sha

If you have a deeper understanding of the organizational structures and staffing of provinces, special districts, counties, and townships, you might ask: Is the policy of "streamlining the upper levels and strengthening the lower levels" correct?

This seems to be a question. Currently, there are several different opinions: one is "the lower levels need people, and the upper levels also need people"; another is that there are already quite a few people at the lower levels; and another is "there are too few people at the lower levels, and they need to be supplemented."

After visiting several provincial-level agencies and county and township organizations in Hebei Province, the reporter has this impression: there are many people at the top, and not few at the bottom either.

In recent years, Hebei Province's level one institutions have been continuously expanding, and the number of personnel has gradually increased. Taking the Hebei Provincial People's Committee as an example, in 1952, there were 20 directly affiliated departments and bureaus, while now there are 32. The number of administrative staff has also increased from more than 1,800 to more than 4,600. The number of provincial-level institutions, enterprises, and businesses has increased even more. For example, the state-owned commerce, grain, and purchasing systems had only 2,600 units in 1954, but now have increased to 9,300 units, and the number of personnel has also increased from 47,000 to 102,000.

However, the county's leading bodies are also constantly expanding. A comrade from the Hebei Provincial Compilation Committee said: In 1952, the general county people's government had only nine sections and offices, while now the county people's committee has seventeen sections and offices, and the number of staff has also increased by about 100% (county public security, taxation, procuratorate, court and other organs are not included).

This statement is based on facts. From the perspective of Ding County, the county's institutions and personnel are rapidly expanding and increasing. In 1955, the Ding County Committee of the Communist Party of China had a total of nine departments, sections, and offices, while in 1956 it had fifteen departments, sections, and offices, and the number of staff also increased from 57 to 122. The Ding County People's Committee has also developed from sixteen sections and offices to twenty sections and offices in the past year, and the number of personnel has increased from 130 to 186.

The county's commercial institutions and personnel have increased even more.

Are there few staff in the townships? No, there are also quite a few people in the townships. Xijianyang Township in Ding County is a large township with more than 2,000 households and more than 13,000 people. In addition to the eight full-time staff working in the township Party committee and the township people's committee, there are also 37 full-time staff in the nine agricultural production cooperatives. There are 66 townships of all sizes in Ding County, with a total of 395 township staff (excluding the staff of agricultural production cooperatives), an average of more than five full-time staff per township. There are even more commercial staff in rural areas. Dongting Town in Ding County is a medium-sized market town with a total monthly commercial turnover of 202,529 yuan, but there are 118 commercial staff, with an average work quota of only more than 1,700 yuan per staff member.

Judging from many situations, the county's personnel are also excessive. The Ding County Party Committee's organs were expanded after October last year. Although a lot of work has been done since October, many important tasks, such as the great development of cooperatives and the launch of the agricultural production increase campaign, were carried out before October. This shows that increasing the number of staff by more than 100% after October is worth studying. Among the newly added institutions, there is a nine-person communications team. According to a responsible comrade in the County Party Committee Office, this communications team could not have been added. Letters to the districts and townships are delivered by the post office. To deal with sending urgent letters, one or two messengers can be set up. Although Wang Chengjun, the secretary of the County Party Committee, said that it is better not to reduce the number of county personnel, he also admitted that the potential of the county's various departments is not small, and recently 67 staff members have been drawn to go to the countryside for a relatively long period of time (one year) to help with their work.

There are also a few more full-time staff in the townships, which can be reduced appropriately. Among the eight township staff in Xijianyang Township, Ding County, two do not necessarily have to be full-time staff. For example, the director of the township democratic women's federation can be a part-time staff member, working and producing at the same time. There are also too many full-time staff in agricultural production cooperatives, even the director of supervision is a full-time staff member.

However, many responsible persons in counties and townships now have a unclear understanding of this situation. After hearing about the central government's policy of "streamlining the upper levels and strengthening the lower levels," a responsible comrade from the Ding County Party Committee said: "There are not enough people in the county, and we need to transfer a group of people from the province to strengthen it." The cry of "lack of people" is even more intense among the township staff. The reporter visited the Party secretaries, deputy secretaries, and township heads of five townships, and they all suggested to the reporter that "there are too many things in the township and too few people, and the number of staff should be increased."

There are two ways to "streamline the upper levels and strengthen the lower levels." One is that there are too few staff at the "lower levels," and a group of staff needs to be transferred from the "upper levels" to supplement them; the other is that there are not few staff at the "lower levels," and there may even be a few too many. This is not a matter of transferring a group of staff from the "upper levels" to supplement the "lower levels," but rather using stronger staff streamlined from the "upper levels" to replace weaker staff at the "lower levels" and mobilizing the weaker staff in the townships to return to production posts. Judging from the current situation, the latter is of greater immediate significance. Among the full-time staff in the townships of Ding County, except for the Party secretary who was the original deputy secretary or member of the district committee, the others were all staff members of the small townships before the districts were abolished and the townships merged. It is very difficult for them to shoulder the work of large townships, and it is completely necessary to carry out an adjustment.

    上层人多，下层人也不少
    金沙
    如果你比较深入地了解省、专区、县和乡的组织机构和工作人员的情况以后，你可能会提出这样的问题：“精简上层，充实下层”的方针对吗？
    这好像是个问题。现在正有着这样几种不同的意见：一种是“下边要人，上边也要人”；一种是下边人员已经不少；一种是“下层人员太少，需要补充”。
    记者访问了河北省的几个省级机关和县、乡的组织以后，有这样一个印象：上层人多，下层人也不少。
    几年来，河北省一级机构是在不断地扩大着，人员在逐渐地增加着。以河北省人民委员会来说，1952年，直属厅、局有二十个，而现在有三十二个，行政编制人员也由一千八百多人增加到四千六百多人。省的事业、企业机构增加得更多。例如国营商业、粮食、采购等系统，1954年只有二千六百个单位，现在增加到九千三百个单位，人员也由四万七千名增加到十万二千名。
    但是县的领导机构同样是在不断地扩大着的。河北省编制委员会的一个同志说：在1952年，一般县的县人民政府只有九个科、室，而现在县人民委员会则有十七个科室，工作人员也增加一倍左右（县的公安、税务、检察、法院等机关还不包括在内）。
    这个说法是有根据的。从定县来看，县的机构和人员，就是在迅速地扩大和增加着的。中共定县委员会，1955年共有九个部、科、室，而1956年就有了十五个部、科、室，工作人员也就由五十七名增加到一百二十二名。定县人民委员会，一年来也由十六个科、室发展成二十个科、室，人员由一百三十人发展到一百八十六人。
    县的商业机构和人员增加得更多。
    乡的工作人员不多吧？不是的，乡的人员也不少。定县西建阳乡是个大乡，全乡有二千多户，一万三千多人，专职工作人员，除了在乡党委会和乡人民委员会工作的八名外，在九个农业生产合作社中还有三十七名。定县全县大小乡六十六个，乡的工作人员共有三百九十五名（农业生产合作社的工作人员不包括在内），平均每个乡有五个多专职工作人员。乡村商业工作人员更多。定县东亭镇是个中等集镇，每个月的商业营业总额二十万二千五百二十九元，但是商业工作人员却有一百一十八名，平均起来每个工作人员的工作定额才一千七百多元。
    从许多情况来看，县的人员同样过多。定县县委的机构是去年10月以后扩大的，10月以后虽然做了许多工作，但是不少重要工作，例如合作社大发展、开展农业增产运动，都是在10月以前进行的。这就说明了10月以后增加工作人员一倍多，就值得研究。在新增加的机构中，有一个九人的通讯班。据县委办公室的一个负责同志谈：这个通讯班是可以不增加的，给各区、乡的信件由邮局传递。为了应付送急件，可以设一两个通讯员。县委书记王成俊同志虽然说县的人员以不减为好，但也承认县各部门的潜力不小，最近就抽出六十七个工作人员比较长期地（一年）下乡帮助工作。
    乡的专职工作人员也多了一点，可以适当减少。定县西建阳乡八名乡的工作人员中，就有两名可以不必是专职工作人员。例如乡民主妇女联合会主任，就可以是兼职工作人员，一边生产一边工作。农业生产合作社中，专职人员也太多，连监察主任都是专职工作人员。
    但是现在有许多县、乡的负责人员，对这种情况是认识不清的。定县县委的一个负责同志听说到中央的“精简上层，充实下层”的方针以后，说过这样的话：“县的人不够，正需要从省抽调一批人来充实。”叫喊“人少”，在乡的工作人员中更加厉害。记者访问了五个乡的党委书记、副书记和乡长，他们都向记者提出了“乡的事情太多，人员太少，应该增加工作人员”的意见来。
    “精简上层，充实下层”有两种作法，一种是“下层”工作人员太少，需要从“上层”抽调一批工作人员来补充；一种是“下层”工作人员不少，甚至还多了点，这就不是从“上层”抽调一批工作人员来补充“下层”的问题，而是用“上层”精简下来的比较强的工作人员，来替换“下层”比较弱的工作人员和动员乡的比较弱的工作人员回到生产岗位上去的问题了。从目前情况来看，后一点迫切意义更大。定县各乡的专职工作人员中，除了党委书记是原来的区委副书记、区委委员外，其他都是撤区并乡以前的小乡的工作人员，要他们担负大乡的工作，是非常吃力的，完全有必要进行一次调整。
