    Shandong Immigrants Take Root in the Great Northern Wilderness
    More Than Seven Thousand Family Members Move to New Immigrant Villages Ahead of Schedule

    (Our Newspaper) News: The newly established Shandong immigrant villages in the "Great Northern Wilderness" have recently been filled with festive joy once again, as reclamation team members busily receive their families. Since the beginning of winter, more than two thousand households, totaling seven thousand five hundred and eighty-nine family members, have moved to the new villages. The pioneers originally planned to bring their families next year. This year, the Great Northern Wilderness has achieved a bumper harvest, with an average income of more than three thousand jin of grain per person, in addition to sideline income. Taking Zhonghe Township in Nehe County as an example, 47.7% of households have a net income of between 360 and 1,000 yuan, 37% between 250 and 350 yuan, and only 15.3% around 230 yuan, all significantly exceeding the income in their hometowns. Seeing this situation, the pioneers are even more eager to settle down here, and the original plan to have their families move next year has now been brought forward.

    In order to welcome the arrival of the families, the local government and agricultural cooperatives have long helped the pioneers prepare new houses, firewood, vegetables, and other necessities. For example, in the Sixth New Village of Dagemiao District in Zhaozhou County, fifty new houses were built, plastered with mud twice inside and out, and heated platforms were constructed. In addition, 600 jin of rations were left for each family member, two carts of firewood were prepared, and a large jar of pickled vegetables, potatoes, and cabbage, and other non-staple foods were prepared for every three people. Some places also arranged entertainment programs and slaughtered fat pigs to welcome their loved ones.

    In order to help the family members arrive smoothly at the new villages, Gannan, Lindian, Longjiang, Zhaozhou, Anda, and other counties successively sent fifty cadres and three hundred and thirty-one immigrant representatives back to Shandong to welcome them.

    During the migration, the family members' transportation and food expenses were all borne by the state. Reception stations were set up in Shenyang, Harbin, Jiamusi, and other places along the way, so they all arrived smoothly in their new hometowns. (Gu Fei)

    山东省移民在北大荒扎根
    七千多名家属提前迁到移民新村
    本报讯　在“北大荒”新建立起来的山东移民新村，近日来又呈现出节日的欢乐景象，垦荒队员们忙着接待自己的家属。入冬以来，迁至新村的家属已有两千多户共七千五百八十九人。拓荒者们原来计划明年才接家属，今年，北大荒获得了丰收，除副业收益外，每人平均可收入三千多斤粮食。以讷河县中和乡为例，纯收入在三百六十至一千元的户占47.7％，二百五十至三百五十元的户占37％，二百三十元左右的户仅占15.3％，都大大超过了原籍的收入。垦荒的人们看到这种情况，在这里安家立业的心情更加迫切，原计划明年才让家属迁来，现在要求提前实现了。
    为了迎接家属的到来，当地政府和农业社很早就帮助拓荒者准备好了新房、烧柴、菜蔬等。如肇州县大阁庙区第六新村，新盖了五十间房子，屋内外抹了两遍泥，又搭了火炕。另外，还给每个家属留下了六百斤口粮，准备了两车烧柴，给每三个人准备了一大缸咸菜和土豆、白菜等副食品。有些地方还赶排文娱节目、宰杀肥猪来迎接亲人。
    为了帮助家属顺利地到达新村，甘南、林甸、龙江、肇州、安达等县先后派出五十名干部、三百三十一名移民代表，回山东迎接他们。
    迁移中，家属的交通费和伙食费全由国家负担。在沿途的沈阳、哈尔滨、佳木斯等地都设有接待站，因而他们都顺利地到达了新的家乡。　（顾非）
