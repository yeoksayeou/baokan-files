Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 16th. Chinese Ambassador to Poland, Wang Bingnan, held a grand reception on the evening of the 15th to celebrate Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Poland. Polish Party and state leaders Gomułka, Zawadzki, Cyrankiewicz, Ochab, Chairman of the Polish Democratic Party Kulczyński, one of the leaders of the Polish United People's Party, Ozga-Michalski, and Speaker of the Polish Parliament, Dąbrowski, all attended the banquet.

Heads of diplomatic missions from various countries that have established diplomatic relations with our country also attended the banquet.

Ambassador Wang Bingnan expressed his welcome and gratitude to the guests attending the banquet.

Following this, Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech. He said, "We all know that since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Polish people, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, have corrected past leadership errors, consolidated the socialist system, strengthened the ties between the Party and the people, strengthened domestic and intra-Party unity, and further improved relations with socialist countries, especially with the Soviet Union, in accordance with the Leninist spirit of national equality and proletarian internationalism. These achievements are tremendous and are well-known facts. After visiting various parts of Poland, we have gained a deeper understanding of these achievements. The Chinese Communist Party supports these achievements."

Premier Zhou Enlai said, "In the past five days, we have not only visited Warsaw but also visited famous cities such as Krakow, Wrocław, and Łódź, and have come into contact with workers, youth, and women. Through these contacts, we have further seen the great achievements made by the Polish people in socialist construction under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party. The main manifestation of these achievements is the transformation of a former agricultural country into a socialist industrial country. During our visit, we also saw the Polish people's love for their motherland, their dedication to creative labor, and their desire for peace in Europe and the world. At the same time, we have seen the friendship of the Polish people towards the Chinese people and are deeply moved. We would like to assure our Polish brothers that in the cause of building socialism, the 600 million Chinese people will always be comrades and comrades-in-arms of the Polish people."

Premier Zhou Enlai exclaimed: "Long live the great Polish people! Long live the People's Republic of Poland!" He also proposed a toast to Marxism-Leninism, to the unity of socialist countries, to the correct leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, and to the health of Comrade Gomułka.

Comrades Gomułka, Zawadzki, and Cyrankiewicz also delivered brief speeches at the banquet.

Comrade Gomułka said that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Poland will further promote the development of friendly relations between Poland and great China. The strength of socialist countries lies in their unity and exploration of creative ideas. The transformation made by our Party's Eighth Plenary Session has consolidated our Party and created conditions for closer friendly relations between Poland and the Soviet Union and between the two parties. These resolutions have received full support not only within our Party but also among the Communist Parties of other countries, including the Chinese Communist Party. Our Party and the Chinese Communist Party share the same understanding of Marxist-Leninist internationalism and the unity of socialist countries. I propose a toast to great China, to the Chinese Communist Party, and to the leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong.

Comrade Zawadzki said that the Polish people received the Chinese delegation with deep sympathy. Common ideals and aspirations bind us together. He proposed a toast to the great Chinese people! To the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong!

Comrade Cyrankiewicz, in his speech, once again emphasized on behalf of the Polish government that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Poland will further strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries. He said that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Poland allows him to understand that the entire Polish people unanimously acknowledge the commonality of socialist ideas and the friendship and alliance between the people of socialist countries. One can also see the Polish people's unity in socialist construction, their solidarity with the peace camp, and their heartfelt welcome to the Chinese government delegation. Comrade Zhou Enlai said that the Chinese people will always be comrades-in-arms of the Polish people in socialist construction. We highly appreciate this. In terms of numbers, we cannot compare with the 600 million people and great China, but in the human will we all possess, we are the same. Every time we recall the dark days during the Hitler occupation, our eyes look towards our allies.

Comrade Cyrankiewicz finally proposed a toast to the Chinese government delegation, to the head of the delegation, to the outstanding leaders and fighters of the Chinese people who are fighting on the international stage for China's position, for peace, and for easing international tensions, and to Comrade Zhou Enlai.

    为周恩来总理访问波兰
    王炳南大使举行招待会
    波兰党和国家的领导人出席了宴会
    新华社华沙16日电　中国驻波兰大使王炳南在15日晚为周恩来总理访问波兰举行盛大招待会，波兰党和国家的领导人哥穆尔卡、萨瓦茨基、西伦凯维兹、奥哈布、波兰民主党主席库尔钦斯基，波兰统一农民党领导人之一奥兹加—密哈尔斯基和波兰议会议长邓博夫斯基等都出席了宴会。
    与我国建立了外交关系的各国驻波兰使节也出席了宴会。
    王炳南大使在宴会上表示欢迎和感谢出席宴会的来宾。
    接着，周恩来总理讲话。他说，我们大家都知道，从波兰统一工人党八中全会之后，波兰人民在波兰统一工人党领导之下，纠正了过去领导的错误，巩固了社会主义制度，密切了党同人民的联系，加强了国内和党内的团结，还根据列宁主义的民族平等和无产阶级国际主义的精神更加改善了同社会主义各国，首先是同苏联的关系，这些成绩是巨大的，是大家都知道的事实。我们在波兰各地访问后，也更进一步了解了这些成绩。中国共产党支持这些成绩。
    周恩来总理说，我们在过去五天中，不但访问了华沙，还访问了克拉科夫、弗罗茨瓦夫、罗兹等著名的城市，接触到工人、青年和妇女。在这些接触中，我们进一步看到了波兰人民在波兰统一工人党领导下，在社会主义建设中获得了巨大成就，这些成就的主要表现，就是把过去的农业国变成了社会主义的工业国。我们在访问中，也看到了波兰人民对祖国的热爱，对创造性劳动的努力，对欧洲和世界和平的热望。我们同时看到了波兰人民对于中国人民的友谊，并深为感动。我们愿向波兰的兄弟保证，在建设社会主义的事业中，六亿中国人民永远是波兰人民的同志和战友。
    周恩来总理高呼：伟大的波兰人民万岁！波兰人民共和国万岁！他并且建议为马克思列宁主义、为社会主义各国的团结、为波兰统一工人党的正确领导、为哥穆尔卡同志的健康干杯。
    哥穆尔卡、萨瓦茨基、西伦凯维兹等同志也在宴会上发表了简短的讲话。
    哥穆尔卡同志说，周恩来总理对波兰的访问将更加促进波兰和伟大中国之间的友谊关系的发展，社会主义国家的力量在于他们的团结和探讨创造性的思想，我党的八中全会所做的转变，巩固了我们的党，并为更加密切波苏两国和两党之间的友谊关系创造了条件。这些决议不但在我们党内得到了全力的支持，而且在其他国家的共产党中也得到了支持，其中包括中国共产党。我们党和中国共产党对马克思列宁主义国际主义和社会主义国家的团结的认识是一致的。我建议为伟大的中国、为中国共产党、为中国人民的领袖毛泽东干杯。
    萨瓦茨基同志说，波兰人民以深深同情的感情接待了中国代表团。共同的理想和志愿把我们结合在一起。他建议为伟大的中国人民干杯！为中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东同志干杯！
    西伦凯维兹同志在讲话中代表波兰政府再一次强调指出，周恩来总理对波兰的访问将使两国的友好关系更加密切。他说，周恩来同志在波兰的访问可以了解到波兰全体人民一致承认，社会主义思想的共同性和社会主义各国人民间的友谊和各国的联盟。也可以看到，波兰人民在社会主义建设中的一致，同和平阵营的团结以及对中国政府代表团的由衷的欢迎。周恩来同志曾说，中国人民永远是波兰人民在社会主义建设中的战友。我们对此予以很高的评价。在数量上，我们不能同六亿人民和伟大的中国相比，但是在人类所具有的意志上大家却是一样的。当我们每次记起在希特勒占领期间的黑暗日子时，我们的眼睛就看着我们的同盟者方面。
    西伦凯维兹同志最后建议为中国政府代表团、代表团团长，为在国际舞台上为中国的地位、为和平、为缓和国际紧张局势而斗争的中国人民的杰出领导人员和战士，为周恩来同志干杯。
