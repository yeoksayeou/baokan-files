    Recycling "Collapsible Crates"
    The First Ministry of Machine Building has decided to gradually promote the experience of the Dalian Machine Tool Plant in manufacturing and recycling "collapsible crates" within its affiliated professional systems starting this year.
    Every year, the packaging crates used by various industrial departments for their manufactured products consume a large amount of wood. Once the products are delivered to the ordering units, the packaging crates are mostly discarded. Therefore, organizing the recycling of packaging crates and processing them for reuse has always been a concern for various industrial departments, and some measures have been researched. The "collapsible crate" of the Dalian Machine Tool Plant is one of the better ones. According to calculations by the First Ministry of Machine Building, each "collapsible crate" can be used four to five times, saving about three-quarters of the wood. Because this type of "collapsible crate" can be folded into pieces, reducing its volume, it is convenient for recycling and also saves transportation capacity. Ordering units only need to promptly return the "collapsible crates" to the shipping units and pay a small rental fee, which can also save some funds. (Li Tiefu)

    回收“活页箱”
    第一机械工业部决定今年起在所属各专业系统中逐步推行大连机床厂制造和回收“活页箱”的经验。
    每年，各个工业部门制造产品的包装箱，都要耗费大量木材；一当产品运抵需货单位，包装箱大抵都作废了。因此，组织包装箱回收，进行加工利用，一直是各个工业部门都很关心的问题，并研究出一些措施，大连机床厂的“活页箱”就是其中较好的一种。据第一机械工业部计算，每个“活页箱”可以使用四次到五次，约可节约木材四分之三。由于这种“活页箱”可以折叠成件，能缩小容积，因而回收便利，也能节省运力。需货单位只要及时把“活页箱”退回发货单位，只需付少许租箱费，也能节约一部分资金。　（李铁夫）
