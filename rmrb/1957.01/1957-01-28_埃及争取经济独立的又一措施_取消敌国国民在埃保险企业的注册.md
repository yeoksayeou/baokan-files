Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 27th - According to the Middle East News Agency, the names of sixty-four insurance companies and agencies owned by nationals of enemy countries in Egypt were deregistered from the insurance company registry on the 26th, according to an order from the Egyptian Minister of Finance.

Their business will be transferred to the Egyptian Insurance Organization, composed of nine insurance companies.

Meanwhile, according to a statement by Egyptian Minister of Commerce Nuseir published in the "News" on the 26th, the decree recently signed by President Nasser stipulating that all foreign banks and insurance companies must be nationalized by Egyptian citizens "does not apply to industrial organizations engaged in industrial production with certain patent rights and trademarks." He said, "This law does not apply to foreign automobile companies that have factories in Egypt or oil companies that operate refineries in Egypt. Nor does it apply to travel, transportation, or aviation enterprises.

Nuseir also said that within the scope of this decree are only those purely commercial institutions that conduct "sole agency on commission or entrust others to distribute" business.
Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 26th - The Vice President of the National Bank of Egypt, Ela, said that international banks and United Nations organizations have confirmed that banks wholly owned and operated by Egyptian citizens are capable of engaging in various banking businesses both domestically and internationally.

Ela made these remarks on the 24th when meeting with reporters to discuss the issue of Egypt nationalizing foreign banks within its borders. He said that all Egyptians and their friends eagerly hope that Egypt's economy will break free from the control of imperialist countries.

He said that the activities of foreign banks within Egypt were detrimental to Egyptian interests. After nationalizing these banks, there will be sufficient funds available for Egyptian industrial and commercial enterprises to use and develop Egypt's economy.

He said that nationalizing the agencies of foreign companies will ensure that Egypt obtains what it needs from foreign countries at reasonable prices and will put an end to the phenomenon of secretly smuggling money out of Egypt through import and export. Egypt's balance of payments situation will also be improved as a result.

    埃及争取经济独立的又一措施
    取消敌国国民在埃保险企业的注册
    新华社开罗27日电　据中东通讯社报道，在埃及为敌国国民所拥有的六十四家保险公司和代理机构的名字在26日根据埃及财政部长的命令从保险公司注册簿上注销了。
    它们的业务将移交给由九家保险公司组成的埃及保险业机构。
    同时，据“消息报”26日刊载的埃及商业部长努赛尔的谈话说，最近纳赛尔总统签署的规定所有外国银行和保险公司必须收归埃及公民所有的法令，“并不适用于以某种专利权和商标进行工业生产的工业机构”。他说，“这种法律并不适用于在埃及建有工厂的外国汽车公司或者在埃及经营炼油厂的石油公司。它们也不适用于旅行、运输或航空企业。
    努赛尔还说，在这种法令的范围以内的，只有那些进行“委托独家代销或者委托别人经销”业务的纯粹商业性质的机构。
    新华社开罗26日电　埃及国家银行副总裁埃拉说，国际上的银行和联合国组织证实，完全由埃及公民经营的银行有能力从事它国内外的各种银行业务。
    埃拉在24日接见新闻记者时谈了埃及把境内的外国银行收归埃及公民所有的问题。他说，所有的埃及人和他们的朋友全都热烈希望埃及的经济摆脱帝国主义国家的控制。
    他说，埃及境内外国银行的活动有损于埃及利益。在把这些银行收归埃及公民所有以后，就有足够的资金供埃及的工商企业使用，发展埃及的经济。
    他说，把外国公司的代理机构收归埃及公民所有，将保证埃及以合理的价格从外国得到它所需要的东西，并且会结束那种通过进出口把钱偷偷运出埃及的现象。埃及的支付平衡的情况也将因此得到改善。
