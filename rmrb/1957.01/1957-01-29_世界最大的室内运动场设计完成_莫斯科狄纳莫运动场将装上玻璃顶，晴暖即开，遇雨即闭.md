Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 28th: According to Soviet newspapers, engineers in Moscow have recently completed a very bold and interesting design: to add a roof to the entire Dynamo Stadium. Once this stadium renovation plan is realized, it can accommodate 115,000 spectators, making it the world's largest indoor stadium.

An important part of this plan is the construction of three giant glass roofs, with a total area of 10,000 square meters, which is 2,800 square meters larger than a football field. The glass roof is movable. In winter, the roof is closed, and the indoor temperature is maintained at around 14 degrees Celsius. When the weather is warm, the roof is opened, and in the event of a shower, it can be closed within five minutes. In hot weather, ventilation equipment keeps the interior cool.

The stadium's football field will have year-round green grass, and the stadium will also have a cycling track. A huge stage will be built next to the west grandstand for concerts and other performances.

It is known that there are two very famous indoor stadiums in the United States, one is the Atlantic City Stadium, which can accommodate 40,000 people, and the other is the St. Louis Stadium, which can accommodate 20,000 spectators. Football matches cannot be held in these stadiums.

    世界最大的室内运动场设计完成
    莫斯科狄纳莫运动场将装上玻璃顶，晴暖即开，遇雨即闭
    新华社莫斯科28日电　据苏联报纸报道：莫斯科的工程师们最近完成了一个非常大胆而有趣的设计：把整个狄纳莫运动场加上顶盖。这个运动场改建的计划实现后可以容纳十一万五千名观众，将是世界上最大的室内运动场。
    这个计划的重要部分是建造三个巨大的玻璃顶，它的面积一共有一万平方公尺，比一个足球比赛场地的面积还要大两千八百平方公尺。玻璃顶可以移动。在冬天，顶是关闭的，室内温度保持在摄氏十四度左右。天气暖和的时候，顶盖就敞开着，遇到阵雨，它可以在五分钟内就闭上。天气酷热的时候，通风设备使场内能够保持凉爽。
    运动场的足球场将是常年碧绿的草地，运动场还将设自行车跑道。在紧挨着西看台的地方将建造一个巨大的舞台，供音乐会和其他演出之用。
    大家知道，在美国有两个很著名的室内体育馆，一个是大西洋城的体育馆，可以容纳四万人；另一个是圣路易体育馆，可以容纳二万名观众。这些体育馆内都不能进行足球比赛。
