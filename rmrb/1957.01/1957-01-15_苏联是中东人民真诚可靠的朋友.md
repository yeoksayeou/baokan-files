The so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" recently peddled by the United States to Middle Eastern countries is a vicious colonialist aggression plan. In order to conceal the aggressive nature of this plan, it has fabricated myths such as "preventing Soviet penetration" and "preventing the threat of communism," attempting to deceive the people of Middle Eastern countries.

However, historical records concerning the Middle East region clearly show that the long-term oppression and suffering of the Middle Eastern people is the result of Western colonialist aggression. The Soviet Union has never threatened any country, and it is the most sincere and reliable friend of the Middle Eastern people in their struggle to win and defend national independence. As Shukairy, former Syrian representative to the United Nations, said at the UN Political Committee in December 1955: "It is not the Soviet Union that is suppressing the North African liberation movement. It is not the Soviet Union that created the great tragedy of the Palestine problem. It is not the Soviet Union that is bombarding the southern territories of Yemen. It is not the Soviet Union that is attacking Buraimi in Saudi Arabian territory. All of this is the record of Western countries in the Middle East over the past 150 years."

In the early days of its founding, the Soviet Union resolutely abandoned the Tsarist Russian government's imperialist policy towards Eastern countries and actively supported the independence movements of all oppressed nations. In the Near and Middle East, Soviet Russia gave selfless support to the aspirations of the people of Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey to oppose colonialism and strive for national independence. In 1921, the Soviet Russian government signed a treaty of peace and friendship with Afghanistan, greatly promoting the Afghan people's struggle for national independence. The Soviet government abolished all unequal treaties imposed on Iran by Tsarist Russia and transferred a large amount of Russian property and equipment in Iranian territory to Iran. Soviet Russia and Turkey also signed a treaty of friendship and amity in the same year. Soviet Russia abolished all the enslaving treaties imposed on Turkey by the Tsarist government and gave Turkey great assistance.

The Soviet Union has always given special concern and support to the Arab people's struggle for national independence. As early as 1924, the Soviet Union condemned the British ruling clique's suppression of the Egyptian people's struggle for national independence. In 1947, when the Egyptian government requested the United Nations Security Council to demand the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt, only the Soviet representative firmly supported this just demand and pointed out that the occupation of the Nile Valley by foreign colonial troops must end. Egyptian President Nasser once pertinently pointed out: "After the Second World War, we deeply felt the Soviet Union's help to us. Whenever someone in the United Nations attempted to infringe on Egypt's freedom, the Soviet Union supported us." After the Second World War, the Soviet Union also supported Syria, Lebanon, and other Arab countries in achieving independence from the occupation of Western colonialists.

In the more than ten years since the war, Western imperialism, in order to restore its colonial rule in the Middle East, has launched a fierce offensive against the people of Middle Eastern countries, attempting to stifle the national independence movements of the Middle Eastern people. In 1950, the United States, Britain, and France issued a tripartite declaration, attempting to divide the Arab East into spheres of influence of imperialism and place the political, military, and economic affairs of Arab countries under the control of Western colonial countries. In 1951, the United States began to plan the "Middle East Command," attempting to pull Middle Eastern countries into a military group serving its aggressive interests. After the failure of the "Middle East Command" plan, Western colonial countries planned the Turkey-Pakistan military agreement in 1954 and the Turkey-Iraq military alliance in 1955, forming the Baghdad Pact group. Finally, Iran was also dragged into this aggressive group. Imperialism regarded the Baghdad Treaty Organization as a tool for splitting Arab unity, carrying out colonial expansion in the Middle East, and creating tension. In early 1956, the result of the meeting between the British and American leaders in Washington intensified their steps to interfere in Middle Eastern affairs. The people of the Near and Middle East countries, especially the Arab countries, waged incomparably heroic struggles to defend their national independence and sovereignty against Western colonialism. In these struggles, the people of the Near and Middle East have received the support of the Soviet Union countless times. At every critical juncture in the development of the Middle East situation, the Soviet government has stood firmly on the side of the people of Middle Eastern countries, constantly exposing the imperialist conspiracies to invade Middle Eastern countries and undermine peace in the Middle East. For example, the Soviet government's statement on February 13, 1956, pointed out that the Western colonial countries' conspiracy to plan military blocs and attempt to interfere in Middle Eastern affairs "is obviously contrary to the interests of peace and also violates the vital interests of the people of this region"; the Soviet government "will adhere to the principles of its peaceful foreign policy and will continue to support the cause of peace, safeguard the freedom and independence of Near and Middle Eastern countries and non-interference in their internal affairs, and will work with other relevant countries to consolidate the security of this region."

On the Suez Canal issue that occurred a few months ago, the Soviet Union's impartial and selfless stance of upholding justice and safeguarding peace once again proved that it is a faithful defender of peace in the Middle East. The Soviet Union, together with other peace-loving countries, firmly supported Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal and opposed the imperialist conspiracy of the United States, Britain, and France to carry out "international control" of the Suez Canal. The Soviet Union firmly advocated a peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue on the basis of respecting Egyptian sovereignty and tried its best to oppose the Western colonial countries' conspiracy of armed intervention in Egypt. And when Britain and France brazenly launched a war of aggression against Egypt in disregard of the condemnation of world public opinion, the Soviet Union made great efforts both inside and outside the United Nations, and finally, together with the world's peace forces, exerted the greatest pressure on British and French imperialism, thereby stopping the aggression and saving peace in the Middle East.

The Soviet Union not only sympathizes with and supports the struggle of the people of the Near and Middle East to safeguard national independence in terms of morality, but also provides economic support to the people of this region. Many Middle Eastern countries that have gained independence from colonial rule urgently need to develop their national economies to consolidate their independence, but Western colonial countries are unwilling to see the development of these countries' national economies and refuse to supply them with the production equipment they need; but the Soviet Union has developed truly equal and mutually beneficial economic cooperation relations with them. The Soviet Union has signed trade agreements with Afghanistan, Iran, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, and other Middle Eastern countries. All these trade agreements are conducive to the independent development of the national economies of Middle Eastern countries and conducive to the balance of their foreign trade. The Syrian "Vanguard" wrote in its commentary on the Soviet-Syrian trade agreement that this agreement is "the first step to liberate Syria from foreign monopoly." With the help of the Soviet Union, Afghanistan has established genuine national industries such as cotton mills, oil depots, mechanized granaries, and flour mills. In the spring of 1956, the governments of the Soviet Union and Egypt reached an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy, deciding that the Soviet Union would help Egypt build a nuclear physics laboratory equipped with a basic particle accelerator with an energy of three million electron volts. Last July, the Soviet Union and Egypt signed a cooperation agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy, specifically stipulating the construction of an experimental atomic reactor with a power generation capacity of 2,000 kilowatts equipped with scientific laboratories in Egypt. These all illustrate the Soviet Union's sincere assistance to the people of Middle Eastern countries, which is not attached to any political conditions.

While attacking the people of the Middle East with guns, cannons and dollars, the "Eisenhower Doctrine" tries its best to slander and vilify the Soviet Union, its purpose is very obvious. It wants to undermine the friendship between the Soviet Union and the people of Middle Eastern countries, so that the people of Middle Eastern countries cannot get the aid and support of the Soviet Union in the struggle against colonialism and safeguarding national independence, so that the United States can unscrupulously do whatever it wants in the Middle East, pursue colonialism, and dominate the people of the Middle East. However, the people of the Middle East can see clearly about this conspiracy of the United States. Egyptian President Nasser once said to American reporters: "Our public opinion does not believe you American reporters. You are trying to persuade us to believe that the Soviet Union is the enemy of the Egyptian people; no matter what you say in anti-Soviet propaganda, and no matter what you do, Egypt does not believe you." This reflects the opinions of all the people of Middle Eastern countries who are willing to safeguard their national independence and sovereignty.

    苏联是中东人民真诚可靠的朋友
    冯之丹
    美国最近向中东国家兜售的所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”，是一个凶恶的殖民主义侵略计划。它为了掩饰这个计划的侵略实质，凭空捏造出所谓“防止苏联渗入”、“防止共产主义威胁”等等神话，企图欺骗中东国家人民。
    但是，有关中东地区的历史纪录清楚地表明，中东人民长期遭受压迫和痛苦，是西方殖民主义侵略的结果；苏联从来没有威胁过任何国家，它是中东国家人民在争取和保卫民族独立斗争中的最真诚可靠的朋友。叙利亚前驻联合国代表舒凯里于1955年12月在联合国政治委员会上就说过：“镇压北非解放运动的不是苏联。制造巴勒斯坦问题这个大悲剧的不是苏联。轰击也门南部领土的不是苏联。袭击沙特阿拉伯领土布赖米的不是苏联。这一切都是过去一百五十年中西方国家在中东的纪录。”
    苏联在建国之初，就坚决摈弃了沙皇俄国政府对于东方各国的帝国主义政策，积极支持各被压迫民族的独立运动。在中近东，苏维埃俄国对于阿富汗、伊朗和土耳其人民反对殖民主义斗争和争取民族独立的愿望给予了无私的支持。1921年，苏俄政府同阿富汗签订了和平友好条约，大大地促进了阿富汗人民争取民族独立的斗争。苏维埃政府废除了沙皇俄国加诸于伊朗的一切不平等条约，并把伊朗领土上俄国所有的大量财产和设备转交给了伊朗。苏俄同土耳其也在同一年签订了友好敦睦条约。苏俄废除了沙皇政府所加于土耳其的一切奴役性条约，并给了土耳其很大的帮助。
    对于阿拉伯国家人民的争取民族独立斗争，苏联一向给予了特别深切的关怀和支持。1924年，苏联就曾谴责英国统治集团对埃及人民争取民族独立的斗争的镇压。1947年当埃及政府向联合国安全理事会提出英军撤出埃及的要求时，唯有苏联代表坚决地支持这一正义要求，并指出外国殖民军对尼罗河流域的占领必须结束。埃及总统纳赛尔曾经中肯地指出：“第二次世界大战以后，我们深深地感到苏联对我们的帮助，每当联合国内有人企图侵犯埃及的自由时，苏联就支持我们。”在第二次世界大战以后，苏联也同样支持了叙利亚、黎巴嫩等阿拉伯国家从西方殖民者的占领下取得独立地位。
    战后十多年来，西方帝国主义为了恢复它们在中东的殖民统治，对中东国家人民展开凶恶的进攻，企图扼杀中东人民的民族独立运动。1950年，美英法发表三国宣言，企图把阿拉伯东方分割为帝国主义的势力范围，把阿拉伯各国的政治、军事和经济事务置于西方殖民国家的控制之下。1951年，美国着手策划“中东司令部”，力图把中东国家拉入为它的侵略利益服务的军事集团。在“中东司令部”计划遭到失败以后，西方殖民国家在1954年又策划了土耳其—巴基斯坦军事协定，1955年策划了土耳其—伊拉克军事联盟，组成了巴格达条约集团。最后把伊朗也拖进了这个侵略集团。帝国主义把巴格达条约组织当作它们分裂阿拉伯国家团结、在中东进行殖民扩张和制造紧张局势的工具。1956年初，英美首脑在华盛顿会谈的结果，更加紧了它们干涉中东事务的步骤。中近东各国人民，特别是阿拉伯各国人民为保卫自己民族的独立和主权，同西方殖民主义者进行了无比英勇的斗争。在这些斗争中，中近东人民无数次地得到了苏联的支持。苏联政府在中东形势发展的严重关头，每次都坚定地站在中东国家人民方面，不断地揭露帝国主义侵略中东各国和破坏中东和平的阴谋。例如在1956年2月13日苏联政府发表的声明中就指出：西方殖民国家在中东策划军事集团和企图干涉中东事务的阴谋活动，“显然是违反和平的利益，并且也违反这个地区的人民的切身利益”；苏联政府“将坚守它的和平外交政策的原则，今后将继续支持和平事业，保卫中近东国家的自由独立和内政不受干涉，同时将同其他有关国家一起来努力使这个地区的安全获得巩固。”
    在几个月前发生的苏伊士运河问题上，苏联主持正义和维护和平的大公无私的立场，再一次证明了它是中东和平的忠实的维护者。苏联同其它爱好和平国家一道，坚决地支持埃及对苏伊士运河的主权，反对美英法帝国主义要想对苏伊士运河进行“国际管制”的阴谋计划。苏联坚决地主张在尊重埃及主权的基础上和平解决苏伊士运河问题，竭力反对西方殖民国家对埃及的武装干涉阴谋。而当英法悍然不顾世界舆论的谴责对埃及发动侵略战争的时候，苏联在联合国内外进行了巨大的努力，最后和全世界和平力量一起，对英法帝国主义施加了最大的压力，从而制止了侵略，拯救了中东的和平。
    苏联不仅道义上同情和支持中近东人民维护民族独立的斗争，并且在经济上也给予了这一地区人民以支援。许多从殖民统治下获得了独立的中东国家迫切需要发展它们的民族经济，以巩固它们的独立，但是西方殖民国家不愿意看到这些国家民族经济的发展，拒绝供给它们所需要的生产设备；而苏联却同它们发展了真正平等互利的经济合作关系。苏联同阿富汗、伊朗、埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、也门等中东国家都签订了贸易协定，所有这些贸易协定都是有利于中东各国民族经济的独立发展的，有利于它们对外贸易的平衡。叙利亚“先锋报”在评论苏叙贸易协定时写道：这个协定是使叙利亚“从外国垄断底下解放出来的第一步”。在苏联的帮助下，阿富汗建立了清棉工厂、油库、机械化谷仓和面粉厂等真正的民族工业。1956年春天，苏联和埃及两国政府就和平利用原子能问题达成了协议，决定由苏联帮助埃及建立一个装有能量三百万电子伏特的基本粒子加速器的核子物理实验所。去年7月间，苏埃两国又签订了一个和平利用原子能的合作协定，特别规定在埃及修建一个设有科学实验室的发电两千瓩的实验性原子反应堆。这些都说明了苏联对中东各国人民的真诚的援助，这种援助是不附带任何政治条件的。
      “艾森豪威尔主义”在拿着枪炮和美元向中东人民进攻的时候，竭力对苏联进行毁谤和诬蔑，其目的是十分明显的。它是想要破坏苏联同中东国家人民的友谊，使中东人民在反对殖民主义、维护民族独立的斗争得不到苏联的援助和支持，以便美国能在中东地区肆无忌惮地为所欲为，推行殖民主义，宰制中东人民。但是，对美国这个阴谋，中东人民是看得清楚的。埃及总统纳赛尔曾经对美国记者们说过：“我们的公众舆论不相信你们美国记者，你们企图说服我们去相信苏联是埃及人民的敌人；不管你们在反苏宣传中说了些什么，也不管你们做了些什么，埃及是不相信你们的。”这反映了所有愿意维护自己民族独立和主权的中东各国人民的意见。
