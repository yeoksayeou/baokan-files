At the banquet held by Ambassador Liu Xiao
Comrade Khrushchev's Speech
Stalin heroically and uncompromisingly defended the cause of Marxism-Leninism. May every Communist Party member fight like Stalin. Dear comrades, friends!

    Our gathering today is a grand festival, like a festival of spring. There is nothing better than like-minded people meeting intimately, talking frankly and sincerely, and feeling that their thoughts are in harmony with each other; what could be better than this? In my speech, I don't want to talk about international imperialism, its plans and conspiracies. Of course, some people will be surprised that Khrushchev is speaking without mentioning international imperialism. How can this be? (The hall is lively, applause) It must be admitted that it is not easy for me to do this, and it takes a strong will to restrain myself from talking about this topic. Today, our friendly gathering is so good, everyone is so happy, I don't want to spoil everyone's mood by talking about imperialism. (The hall is lively, applause)

    Recently, people in the West often accuse us of being "Stalinists" and "Stalin elements." We have said more than once about this, as we understand it, "Stalinist" and Stalin himself are inseparable from the great Communist Party member title. When it comes to the revolutionary cause, when it comes to defending the class interests of the proletariat in the revolutionary struggle, and opposing our class enemies, Stalin heroically and uncompromisingly defended the cause of Marxism-Leninism.

    We criticize Stalin, not because he was a bad Communist Party member. We criticize him because he had some deviations and shortcomings, because he made serious mistakes. These shortcomings were first seen by Lenin. Vladimir Ilyich once pointed out these shortcomings and mistakes of Stalin. However, Stalin forgot Lenin's warning in his later years. Stalin made some deviations and mistakes, which caused losses to our cause, which is of course not good. But even if he made mistakes and undermined the rule of law, Stalin was still convinced that he was doing this to protect the achievements of the revolution and the cause of socialism. This is Stalin's tragedy. But in the basic and main aspects (for Marxists-Leninists, the basic and main aspects are to defend the interests of the working class, to defend the cause of socialism, and to fight against the enemies of Marxism-Leninism), may (as the saying goes) God bless, every Communist Party member can fight like Stalin. (Stormy applause)

    The enemies of communism deliberately created the word "Stalinist" and wanted to make it a term of abuse. For all of us Marxists-Leninists, for us who have devoted our lives to the revolutionary struggle, and for the interests of the working class and its fighting vanguard - the Lenin Party, Stalin's name is inseparable from Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, every member of our Soviet Communist Party is willing to be as loyal to the cause of Marxism-Leninism and to the cause of striving for the interests of the working class as Stalin. (Applause)

    The enemies of communism are trying to seize on our criticism of Stalin's shortcomings and mistakes and use this criticism to achieve their own goals. They are trying to direct the criticism of the cult of personality of Stalin against the foundations of our system and against the foundations of Marxism-Leninism. But, gentlemen, this has never had any results, and there will be no results! You can't do this, just like you can't see your ears without a mirror. (Laughter, applause)

    Regarding this gathering of the delegations of our two great socialist countries, we have the right to call it a festival of spring, a festival of strengthening and prospering the eternal and unbreakable friendship between our brotherly peoples. This is a festival of great unity, because our views are consistent, our thoughts are consistent, we have a common will to fight to the end for the victory of the cause of the working class, for the victory of socialism and communism, and we all follow the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism. This is the most important point that brings the Soviet people and the Chinese people, the Soviet Communist Party and the Chinese Communist Party closer.

    Today, we pay tribute to the fraternal Chinese Communist Party for striving for the victory of Marxism-Leninism. (Warm applause) In our opinion, what does the victory of Marxism-Leninism mean? As everyone knows, the socialist system and the capitalist system are competing in the world. We firmly believe that socialism will definitely win in this competition.

    We often hear Western countries accuse us of our remarks about the inevitable demise of the capitalist system. These accusations are especially directed at some of my speeches. When we say that the capitalist system is going to perish, we have never asserted in the past and now that this is to be achieved through our taking violent measures. We believe that the capitalist system will step down from the stage of history as a result of internal power struggles, just like the demise of social formations before it, it will become obsolete and give way to new social formations that arise in the course of historical development. This kind of thing, for example, is like an old person will inevitably die, just like a pregnant woman will inevitably give birth, it is inevitable and impossible to prevent. The new is being born, and the old is dying. Of course, we will use our actions to build socialism and communism in our country to help the new things to win faster to a certain extent. The power of demonstration is a great power. (Warm applause)

    I propose a toast to the fraternal Chinese Communist Party, to its leadership, to the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, to Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Comrade Zhou Enlai, Comrade Zhu De, Comrade Chen Yun, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, Comrade He Long, and to all the members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party who have marched forward with us side by side and will continue to march together along the victorious road of Marxism-Leninism in the future. (Warm and prolonged applause)

    在刘晓大使举行的宴会上
    赫鲁晓夫同志的讲话
    斯大林英勇地、绝不妥协地捍卫马克思列宁主义的事业。但愿每一个共产党员都能像斯大林一样地战斗。亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    我们今天的聚会，是一个盛大的节日，就像春天的节日一样。志同道合的人在一起亲切地相会，坦率而恳切地交谈，感到彼此的思想融洽无问；有什么比这个更好的呢？我在讲话当中不想谈关于国际帝国主义、它们的计划和阴谋这方面的话题。当然，有些人会奇怪，赫鲁晓夫讲话而不提到国际帝国主义，这怎么成呢。（大厅内活跃，掌声）应该承认，这在我是不容易的事，需要很强的意志才能克制自己不谈这个话题。今天，我们友好的聚会是这样好，大家这样高兴，我不愿意谈论帝国主义而破坏大家的兴致。（大厅内活跃，掌声）
    最近，西方常有人指责我们是“斯大林主义者”，是“斯大林分子”。对这一点我们已经不只一次地说过，照我们的理解，“斯大林主义者”和斯大林本人是同伟大的共产党员称号不可分割的。当问题涉及革命事业、涉及在革命斗争中保卫无产阶级的阶级利益、反对我们阶级敌人的时候，斯大林英勇地、绝不妥协地捍卫马克思列宁主义的事业。
    我们批评斯大林，不是因为他是一个不好的共产党员。我们批评他，是因为他有一些偏差和缺点，是因为他犯了严重的错误。这些缺点是列宁最先看到的。弗拉基米尔·伊里奇曾经指出斯大林的这些缺点和错误。但是，斯大林在他的晚年忘记了列宁的警告。斯大林犯了一些偏差和错误，给我们的事业造成损失，这当然是不好的。但是，甚至犯了错误，破坏了法制，斯大林依然深信他这样做是为了保卫革命成果和社会主义事业。斯大林的悲剧也就在这里。而在基本的主要的方面（对马克思列宁主义者来说，基本的和主要的就是保卫工人阶级的利益，保卫社会主义事业，同马克思列宁主义的敌人作斗争），但愿（像俗语所说的那样）上帝保佑，每一个共产党员都能像斯大林一样地战斗。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    共产主义的敌人故意制造出“斯大林主义者”这个字眼，想使它成为诟骂语。对于我们所有马克思列宁主义者来说，对于我们这些毕生致力于革命斗争、为工人阶级及其战斗的先锋队——列宁党的利益而奋斗的人来说，斯大林的名字是同马克思列宁主义不可分割的。因此，我们苏联共产党的每一个党员都愿意像斯大林一样，忠于马克思列宁主义的事业、为工人阶级利益而奋斗的事业。（掌声）
    共产主义的敌人企图抓住我们对斯大林的缺点和错误的批评，利用这种批评来达到自己的目的。他们企图把对斯大林个人崇拜的批评引向反对我们制度的基础，反对马克思列宁主义基础。但是，先生们，这从来没有过任何结果，也不会有什么结果的！你们做不到这点，就像没有镜子你们看不到自己的耳朵一样。（笑声，掌声）
    关于我们两个伟大的社会主义国家代表团这次聚会，我们有权利把它叫做春天的节日，叫做我们兄弟人民之间永恒的、牢不可破的友谊加强和繁荣的节日。这是伟大团结的节日，因为我们的观点一致，我们的思想一致，我们有共同的意志要为工人阶级事业的胜利、为社会主义和共产主义的胜利斗争到底，我们都是遵循着马克思列宁主义学说。这是使苏联人民同中国人民，苏联共产党同中国共产党关系亲密的最主要之点。
    我们今天向争取马克思列宁主义胜利的兄弟的中国共产党致敬。（热烈的掌声）在我们看来，马克思列宁主义的胜利是什么意思呢？大家知道，社会主义制度和资本主义制度正在世界上进行着竞赛。我们坚信，社会主义在这个竞赛中一定获得胜利。
    我们常常听到西方国家指责我们关于资本主义制度必然灭亡的言论。这些责难特别是针对着我的一些演说的。当我们说资本主义制度将要灭亡的时候，我们过去和现在从来没有断言过这是要通过我们采取暴力措施来实现的。我们相信，资本主义制度由于内部力量斗争的结果将走下历史舞台，就像在它以前的社会形态的灭亡一样，自己过时了，就要让位给在历史发展过程中产生的新的社会形态。这种事情，举例说，就像衰老的人必将死亡一样，就像孕妇必将分娩一样，是必然的，是不可能防止的。新的在诞生，旧的在衰亡。当然，我们要用在我们国家里建设社会主义和共产主义的行动，在某种程度上帮助新东西更快地胜利。示范的力量是伟大的力量。（热烈的掌声）
    我提议为兄弟般的中国共产党，为它的领导，为中央委员会政治局，为毛泽东同志、刘少奇同志、周恩来同志、朱德同志、陈云同志、邓小平同志、贺龙同志，为曾经同我们并肩前进并在将来仍将共同沿着马克思列宁主义胜利大道前进的中国共产党中央委员会政治局全体委员们，干杯。（热烈的、长时间的掌声）
