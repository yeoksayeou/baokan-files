    Xinhua News Agency, London, 12th - Macmillan has moved from the Chancellor of the Exchequer's office at 11 Downing Street to the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street. He looked energetic when he entered the Prime Minister's residence, but British newspapers believe that the tasks awaiting him are "not easy."
    Reorganizing an unstable cabinet and "reuniting" the divided Conservative Party is one of the tasks Macmillan will undertake. He is in the process of organizing a new cabinet. He is taking action to eliminate signs of discord with Rab Butler, a "left-wing" leader with considerable influence within the Conservative Party. It is rumored that he may appoint Butler as Deputy Prime Minister or Foreign Secretary in order to gain Butler's support. However, Butler is opposed by the "Suez Group" within the Conservative Party.
    Macmillan also intends to quickly "repair" the rift between Britain and the United States. Three hours after taking office, he immediately met with Sir Harold Caccia, the British envoy who had lived in the United States for more than three years. This meeting was seen as a manifestation of his "determination to restore trust on both sides of the Atlantic." There are also reports that Eisenhower has resumed private exchanges with Macmillan, which will pave the way for Anglo-American talks. However, there are also reports that some radicals within the Conservative Party are putting pressure on the new Prime Minister to implement a more independent policy towards the United States.
    Finding ways to solve the sterling crisis, shortage of petroleum products, and price fluctuations caused by the invasion of Egypt are also serious problems facing Macmillan. Britain barely avoided the devaluation of the pound by borrowing a loan of 560 million U.S. dollars from the International Monetary Fund and a loan of 500 million pounds from the Export-Import Bank of the United States. However, some are asking: Where will the money be found to repay these two loans in three years?

### 麦克米伦新官上任  内政外交难关重重

    麦克米伦新官上任
    内政外交难关重重
    新华社12日讯　伦敦消息：麦克米伦已经从伦敦唐宁街十一号财政大臣办公室搬进了唐宁街十号首相官邸。他在进入首相官邸时精神奕奕，但是英国报纸认为，等待着他的任务“可不轻松”。
    改组不稳的内阁和使分裂着的保守党“重新团结起来”，是麦克米伦要着手的一项工作。他正在进行组织新内阁的活动。他正采取行动要消除同在保守党内有相当势力的“左翼”领袖巴特勒不和的迹象。传说他可能任命巴特勒为副首相或外交大臣，这样来取得巴特勒的支持。然而，巴特勒又是保守党内“苏伊士集团”反对的人物。
    麦克米伦还打算迅速“弥补”英美裂痕。他上任三小时后立即同在美国住了三年多的英国使节麦金斯会谈，这个会谈被认为是他“恢复大西洋两岸的信任的决心”的表现。还有消息说，艾森豪威尔已经同麦克米伦恢复了私人之间的来往，这将为英美会谈作出安排。但是，也有消息报道，一些保守党里的急进派正在向新首相施加压力，要它实施对美国更为独立的政策。
    设法解决侵埃行动造成的英镑危机、石油产品缺乏、物价波动，也是麦克米伦面临的严重问题。英国由于在美国向国际货币基金借了一笔五亿六千万美元的贷款，和向进出口银行借了一笔五亿英镑的贷款，才勉强使英镑没有贬值。但是，有人在问：从哪里去找钱在三年时间里偿还这两笔贷款呢？
