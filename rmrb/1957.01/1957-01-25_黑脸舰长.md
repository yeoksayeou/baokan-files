    "Black-Faced Captain"
    Lu Qiming
    The sunset dyed the calm, azure sea in brilliant colors, and the warships anchored in the bay shone like dazzling jewels. At this moment, I and the sailors were sitting around on the deck, chatting. We were deep in conversation when the engine mechanic Deng Shimin suddenly exclaimed with surprise: "Look, our captain's face has changed!" I and the sailors all looked at the captain and laughed.

    At this moment, Captain Xu stepped onto the deck from the ship's ladder. He was only twenty-six years old, with a strong and sturdy build. One sailor said that Captain Xu had to turn sideways to enter the wheelhouse. But now, he was walking unsteadily.

    "Captain, come and join us." Captain Xu slowly walked towards us. He waved his weak hand, smiling: "I'm already exhausted, who's still making fun of me, huh?" As he said this, the sailors pulled Captain Xu to sit on the anchor winch.

    Deng Shimin, a twenty-one-year-old young man who loves cleanliness and is very handsome, although he spends all day in the engine room, never has a single oil stain on his clothes. During breaks, he always dresses neatly. At this moment, hearing what the captain said, he immediately took a small, long oval mirror from his pocket and handed it to the captain: "If you don't believe me, look at yourself!"

    Captain Xu looked at everyone in disbelief, took the mirror, and, sure enough, he was right, his original round, fair face had turned black.

    The skin on his nose and cheeks had already peeled off, and only a pair of dark eyes shone in the glow of the setting sun. He looked at everyone again, touched his face, and joked:

    "I'm about to develop pessimistic thoughts!"

    "Why?" the sailors immediately asked.

    "Because I can't find a lover anymore!" He frowned, pretending to be sad: "Look at my black face, which girl would love me?"

    "No, you're wrong, Captain! Precisely because you've turned black, girls will love you even more! Because..."

    "That's right!" Sergeant Signalman Qian Qingshou said seriously, "The captain's face used to look like a ripe apple. Do you know how he got black? My work station today was right behind the captain. It's been terribly hot these days, but the captain has been standing on the command platform for twelve hours. Especially at noon, his feet feel like they're standing on hot bricks; the paint on the deck is all wrinkled by the sun. You tell me, people are made of flesh and blood, covered in skin, how can they stand it! At three o'clock in the afternoon, the captain ordered me to signal the fleet commander to designate our warship's berthing position. I was already waving the semaphore flags when the captain happened to step back a few steps, and the flag hit him in the face. He didn't even touch it. Later I asked him if it hurt, and guess what he said? He said, 'I didn't feel it!' See, the captain's face is numb from the sun!..."

    "Lunch had been open for ten minutes, and when I walked into the dining room, the captain's food hadn't been touched. I waited another five minutes, but the captain still didn't come down. I got anxious," Private First Class Communicator Hu Chenglin interjected, "So I took the food to the command platform. I said: 'Captain, eat quickly!' But the captain said: 'Navigator, check the ship's position... Heading seventy degrees, forward three...' See, he didn't even hear me calling him. There was nothing I could do, I pulled him, and he smiled and said: 'Little Hu, how can I leave my work to eat, wait a moment!' So, he didn't eat until three o'clock..."

    Before Hu Chenglin could finish speaking, several other officers and sailors wanted to speak, and the captain got anxious:

    "Stop talking, what's the point of saying all this!" Captain Xu was embarrassed by everyone's words and interrupted them with a commanding tone.

    "Captain, please bear with it a little longer, I haven't finished yet!" Qian Qingshou chimed in again, "Nowadays, girls love those who are wholeheartedly serving the people. Therefore, I guarantee, Captain, that you'll find a satisfactory good girl!..."

    Before Qian Qingshou could finish speaking, the sailors constantly echoed: "That's right!" "Absolutely correct!" followed by a burst of laughter.

    The laughter crossed the waves, passed through the sea breeze, and clear echoes rang out from the nearby valleys.

    “黑脸舰长”
    陆其明
    夕阳把平静的碧蓝大海映成五光十色，停泊在海湾里的军舰像宝石似的，辉映得闪闪夺目。这时候，我和水兵们正围坐在甲板上聊天。我们谈兴正浓，轮机兵邓石敏突然发出惊喜的叫声：“看，咱们舰长的脸色变啦！”我和水兵们不约而同地都望了望舰长，笑了起来。
    这时候，徐舰长已由船梯踏上甲板。他只有二十六岁，身体很结实魁梧。一个水兵说，徐舰长到舵房去，必须侧着身子才能走得进。但是现在，他走起路来却摇晃着。
    “舰长同志，到这儿来玩玩。”徐舰长慢吞吞地向我们走来。挥了挥无力的手，微笑着：“我已经累得够呛，谁还拿我寻开心，嗯？”说着，徐舰长被水兵们拉到锚机上坐下。
    邓石敏，是个二十一岁的最爱清洁、漂亮的小伙子，他虽然整天在机舱里转，可他衣服上从没有一点油斑，到休息时间，他总是穿得整整齐齐。这时候，他听到舰长这么一说，马上从裤袋里掏出一面长圆形的小镜子，递给舰长：“不信，你自己照照！”
    徐舰长不相信地看了看大家，拿过镜子一看，呀，一点不错，他那原来圆圆的、白里透红的脸上，已变成乌黑的了。
    在鼻尖和两颊上，已经脱了皮，只有一双乌黑眼睛在夕阳的辉耀下闪闪发光。他又瞅了瞅大家，摸摸脸蛋，打趣地说：
    “我要产生悲观思想啦！”
    “为什么？”水兵们立即追问开了。
    “因为我再也找不到爱人啦！”他绉了绉眉，装做伤心的样子：“你们看看，我这个黑脸儿，还有那一位姑娘爱我？”
    “不，你说得不对，舰长同志，正因为你变黑了，姑娘更会爱上你哩！因为……”
    “说得对！”中士信号兵钱庆寿一本正经地说，“舰长的脸过去也是长得像熟透的苹果。你们知道他是怎么黑的？我今天的工作位置就在舰长后面。这几天真热得怕人，但是舰长在指挥台上一站就是十二个小时，特别到了中午，脚像踏在火砖上；甲板上的油漆都晒绉了，你们说，人是肉做的、皮包的，怎受得了！下午三点钟，舰长命令我发信号请编队指挥员指定我们军舰停泊的位置，我已打着手旗，舰长不知怎么的刚巧往我身边退了几步，一下手旗打在他的脸上，他摸都没摸。后来我问他疼不疼，你们猜，他怎么回答，他说：‘我没有感觉到！’看，舰长的脸都晒麻木了！……”
    “午饭已开过十分钟了，我走进餐厅里一看，舰长的饭菜还没有动，我又等了五分钟，还是不见舰长下来，我急了，”上等兵通讯员胡成林抢着说，“我就把饭菜端到指挥台上去，我说：‘舰长，快吃饭吧！’但是舰长却说：‘航海长，测一下舰位，……航向七十度，前进三……’看，他听都没有听见我叫他，没办法，我拉了他一把，他才笑着说：‘小胡，你看我怎能丢下工作去吃饭，再等一刻吧！’这样，一直到三点钟才吃饭……”
    胡成林还没说完，又有几个军官和水兵要发言，舰长发急了：
    “别说啦，说这些干啥！”徐舰长给大家说得不大好意思，用命令的口气打断大家的话。
    “舰长同志，请忍耐着点儿，我还没说完呢！”钱庆寿又插上来说，“现在的姑娘最爱那些忠心耿耿为人民服务的人，因此，我担保你舰长同志，能找到一位称心如意的好姑娘！……”
    钱庆寿的话还没有说完，水兵中不断地发出附和声：“说得对！” “完全正确！”接着是一阵哄笑声。
    欢笑声越过海浪，穿过海风，附近山谷里传出清脆的回声。
