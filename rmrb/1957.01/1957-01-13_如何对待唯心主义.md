How to Treat Idealism
Zhang Dainian

Minister Lu Dingyi pointed out in his report "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend": "Among the people, there is not only the freedom to propagate materialism, but also the freedom to propagate idealism. As long as one is not a counter-revolutionary element, one has the freedom to propagate either materialism or idealism." This is a new proposition with profound significance, and it is a new explanation of the principles and methods of philosophical and theoretical struggle. Many comrades have already written a lot about their experiences on this issue. Mr. Zheng Xin, in his article "Opening up Idealism" (People's Daily, October 18, 1956), further put forward his detailed and insightful views. I would also like to talk about some of my own superficial views on this issue. I will discuss three issues here: (1) An assessment of the achievements of ideological transformation of philosophical workers since liberation; (2) The laws and characteristics of philosophical and theoretical struggle, that is, how to evaluate idealism; (3) The focus of "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" in philosophical thought.

(I)

Since liberation, intellectuals from the old China have undergone a series of ideological transformation movements, and their thinking has undergone fundamental changes. Many (though not all) famous idealist philosophers have abandoned their own idealist systems and become ardent supporters of Marxist philosophy; most natural scientists have also freed themselves from the domination of bourgeois philosophical viewpoints and accepted the guidance of dialectical materialism; ordinary intellectuals, with the exception of a very few, have also become enthusiastic supporters of Marxist philosophy. This is a change of great significance, a major event in Chinese intellectual history, and also a major event in human intellectual history, which future philosophical historians will certainly write about in detail.

Now we will only talk about the transformation of some idealists. Some famous idealist philosophers were indeed somewhat reluctant when they first studied Marxist philosophy at the beginning of liberation, and they really had a feeling of "cherishing one's own broom" for their old ideas. However, after learning and discussion, and after inner ideological struggle, they gradually changed. After a period of time, the change in quantity led to a change in quality, and many people's positions, viewpoints, and methods underwent a major transformation. In the old Chinese saying, they truly "abandoned their studies to learn," and reached the point of "joy and sincerity in their hearts." They truly recognized the absurdity and harm of idealism, and understood the correctness and effectiveness of materialism. They realized that only Marxist philosophy is the truth that conforms to the facts, and only it is the pointer that guides people to reach the highest ideals of mankind.

The transformation of many idealists into materialists proves what? This proves the great persuasiveness of Marxist truth, and it further proves the correctness of the Marxist proposition that social existence determines social consciousness. Since liberation, our economic system has been fundamentally changed, class relations have undergone earth-shaking changes, and social life has undergone essential transformations. The class roots of old idealism have gradually disappeared; the victory of the revolutionary cause has further proved the greatness of Marxist power and proved that Marxism is the only truth for saving the country and the people. These facts cannot but affect the consciousness of the old idealists. Thus, with the transformation of their political stance, they also entered the gate of Marxism and began to understand the theories of dialectical materialism and historical materialism with sympathetic eyes, and finally abandoned their past philosophical prejudices.

The transformation of many idealists since liberation is another great victory for Marxism on the philosophical front, a great achievement of the Chinese Communist Party's ideological work, and a brilliant result of the Chinese Communist Party's wise policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals.

In the process of ideological transformation, there have also been some shortcomings. Due to the prevalence of dogmatism, many transformed philosophical workers have been bound by dogmatism and dare not put forward their own original views based on the analysis of facts. At the same time, due to the short period of time, ideological transformation has also been not detailed and in-depth enough. This is manifested in the fact that many people's transformation has only achieved "abandoning their studies," and has not conducted a careful analysis and examination of what they learned in the past. During the "Three-Anti" movement, there was a slogan "Throw away the baggage." Later, the baggage was thrown away, but what exactly was inside the baggage was not carefully examined. The baggage in the mind is originally an internal thing, and it is not as easy to discard as discarding the baggage outside. It is necessary to check each item inside, remove the morbid items piece by piece with a knife, and still preserve the healthy items. This is a long-term process. The past ideological transformation had shortcomings in this regard. Nevertheless, in the process of ideological transformation, the prominent root causes of the old ideas of many intellectuals have been examined and removed. Therefore, the transformation of the majority of intellectuals from the old China is a sincere transformation, and this should also be recognized.

Mr. Zheng Xin also talked about the issue of ideological transformation in his article "Opening up Idealism." Mr. Zheng's views are sharp, but there are shortcomings, that is, the article underestimates the achievements of the ideological transformation of the old philosophical workers. Mr. Zheng said: "Since liberation, our political consciousness has generally improved, but our idealist academic thought has remained unchanged or has changed little. We are both materialists and idealists: we are materialists in public and idealists in the study. We are materialists in politics and idealists in academic thought. This is our contradiction." This situation does exist, but it is by no means a universal situation. According to my own observations and understanding over the years, the majority of idealists have indeed switched camps and stood on the side of materialism in their studies. However, Mr. Zheng's statement in his article that "the hidden idealist thoughts and the open political enthusiasm, 'two peaks facing each other, two rivers flowing separately,' do not interfere with each other" is not a realistic estimate.

What Mr. Zheng said probably has its factual basis, but it seems inevitable to regard local phenomena as general situations. In my opinion, the acceptance of Marxist philosophy by many philosophical workers from the old China is not superficial, not formalistic, but internal, and has undergone a process of internal ideological struggle.

Mr. Zheng's article believes that the policy of "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is an "ideological liberation" for the vast number of intellectuals who came from the old China. How should this so-called "ideological liberation" be understood? The article also said: "This gives those with idealist thoughts a feeling of unlimited freedom." It seems that the so-called "ideological liberation" refers to the freedom for idealists to defend their own views. On this point, my views are also somewhat different. I believe that if "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is a kind of "ideological liberation," then it should be a liberation from dogmatism, a liberation from those rules and regulations that hinder the development of thought, and from then on, creative thought can fly freely on the basis of facts. This is also the case for materialists. As for the freedom for idealist thoughts to be defended, that is secondary.

(II)

Mr. Zheng Xin's article talked about the evaluation of idealist philosophy and put forward many insightful views, with which I completely agree. In particular, Mr. Zheng pointed out that modern idealism "has its meticulous and in-depth side in epistemology (and logic), although it is distorted and one-sided." This is a pragmatic observation and is completely correct. Here, I will make some simple supplements on the issue of the evaluation of idealism.

The Chinese revolution was carried out under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and achieved brilliant success under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism. In the new society of new China, Marxist philosophy should be the dominant ideology, which is a matter of course. But why is idealism still allowed the freedom to propagate? This is related to the laws of the development of philosophical thought and the characteristics of philosophical and theoretical struggle.

The development of philosophy is a process of mutual struggle between materialism and idealism. Materialism has grown and developed in the struggle with idealism. Is this the case in class society, and what about in socialist society? After the success of the socialist revolution, will idealism naturally disappear, and only materialism will stand tall? Minister Lu Dingyi's article "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" gave us a clear answer: "There are also inconsistencies within the people. In thought, there are distinctions between materialism and idealism. This distinction will exist as long as classes exist, and it will exist even after classes are eliminated, and it will exist even in communist society." This shows that idealism not only has class roots, but also has epistemological roots. Even after the elimination of classes, idealism will still exist. In socialist society, the philosophical field will still be a situation of struggle between materialism and idealism.

Since idealism still exists, rather than letting it exist in a disguised and hidden form, why not make it public and give it the freedom to propagate? Making idealism public is more conducive to the unfolding of philosophical and ideological struggle, more conducive to the liveliness of thought, and more conducive to the improvement of theoretical level. This involves the role of idealism in the history of philosophy. Does idealism in the history of philosophy only play a negative and harmful role? In fact, it is not like that. Idealism also has its side that promotes the development of thought. It has seen many facts that materialists have overlooked, it has seen many phenomena that are not easy to explain, and it has paid more attention to many difficult problems that are not easy to solve. For example, the fact that the subject has an active role has often been ignored by past materialists, but idealists have observed it. Human understanding of objective things is a tortuous process, in which there are many phenomena that are not easy to explain and many problems that are not easy to solve, and idealists have also paid special attention to them. However, idealists have misinterpreted the facts they have seen and have exaggerated the difficult problems, and thus have fallen into error. However, the problems it raises still need to be studied. Therefore, the ideas and doctrines of idealism may help to enrich and improve materialist theory.

Philosophical and theoretical struggle has its characteristics. Philosophical and theoretical struggle is not a simple struggle of using force, but a detailed and in-depth struggle through theoretical analysis. A one-stroke approach cannot actually achieve the effect of solving ideological problems. In recent years, the criticism of idealism often has the problem of simplification. Sometimes, giving erroneous ideas a label of idealism is thought to have solved the problem, but in fact the problem has not been solved. Many of the arguments of idealism must be carefully analyzed and must be refuted sharply with powerful arguments. In this way, idealists can be made to admit defeat, and the content of materialism can be further enriched.

In short, allowing idealism the freedom to propagate not only does not harm the prestige of materialism, but can promote the prosperity of materialism.

(III)

Where is the focus of the "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" in the scope of philosophical thought? Is it just to allow idealism to propagate freely? I don't think so. In the process of socialist construction, and after the completion of socialist society, the "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" in the philosophical field is by no means just a contention between materialism and idealism, but more importantly a contention between different schools of thought within the materialist camp. It would be wrong to overemphasize the contention of idealism.

In socialist society, allowing idealism to participate in the "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is a brand-new proposition; under the guidance of the basic principles of Marxist philosophical materialism, different schools of thought can be established, which is also a brand-new and wise policy.

In recent years, a trend has been quite popular, that is, to try to make all thoughts and opinions conform to a certain standard. Only one answer is allowed for one question, and only one interpretation is allowed for one theory. If the answer or interpretation is comprehensive, that's fine; if it is inevitably one-sided, then there will be great drawbacks. It should be admitted that the correct conclusion to academic questions is often not obtained in a short period of time. Although there is only one truth, the process of reaching this one truth is often tortuous and complex. The debate of different opinions is a necessary path. Therefore, the emergence of different schools of thought with different methods and different views should be a law-abiding phenomenon.

The basic principles of materialism are firm and unshakable. However, things are constantly being renewed, and problems are emerging one after another. The content of objective reality is rich, complex, and intricate, including many different aspects. And the knowledge of each researcher is limited, and they inevitably have their own "views" and their own "blinds." The different doctrines of different schools of thought under the guidance of the basic principles of materialism should be reflections of different aspects of objective reality. These different doctrines, although different from each other, can also complement each other. Therefore, the establishment of schools of thought should be a powerful guarantee for the prosperity of academic research and the improvement of theoretical level.

Different schools of thought of materialist philosophy can and should form an alliance. In "On the Significance of Militant Materialism," Lenin taught us: "In order to carry out the work that militant materialists should carry out, in addition to forming an alliance with those thorough materialists who are not Communist Party members, they must also—even more so—form an alliance with those in modern natural science who tend to materialism and are not afraid to oppose the idealist and skeptical philosophical tendencies that are currently prevalent among the so-called 'intellectuals' and boldly defend and promote materialism." This is an instruction of great significance, and it is an instruction that still has practical significance today. Materialists of different identities (Party and non-Party) and different training (philosophers or natural scientists) should form an alliance; materialists who hold different views on specific issues should also form an alliance.

The alliance of materialists is of course an alliance to fight idealism. Although idealism is not necessarily the thought of the enemy, in the eyes of materialists, it cannot but be said to be an ideological enemy. Idealism is not necessarily based on the reactionary class stand; however, it can be used as a hiding place for the remnants of bourgeois decadent ideas. Therefore, the freedom to propagate materialism and the freedom for materialists to criticize idealist thoughts should be respected first.

In our new China, which is undergoing great socialist construction, Marxist materialism should be the dominant ideology, which guarantees the due position of scientific materialism. At the same time, allowing idealism to participate in the "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" guarantees the complete and full realization of freedom of thought. Our academic circles in China today are in an era of high scientific and ideological enthusiasm, and also in an era in which the people's thoughts are fully free. This is a great era full of infinite light.

    如何对待唯心主义
    张岱年
    陆定一部长在“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的报告中指出：“在人民内部，不但有宣传唯物主义的自由，也有宣传唯心主义的自由。只要不是反革命分子，不管是宣传唯物主义或者是宣传唯心主义，都是有自由的。”这是一个有深刻意义的新提法，这是关于哲学理论斗争的方针与方法的新说明。关于这个问题，许多同志已经写出了不少的体会。郑昕先生在“开放唯心主义”一文（1956年10月18日人民日报）中更提出了他的细致而透辟的见解。我也愿意谈一谈个人关于这个问题的一些粗浅的看法。这里谈三个问题：（一）关于解放以来哲学工作者思想改造成就的估计；（二）关于哲学理论斗争的规律与特点，即关于如何评价唯心主义的问题；（三）关于在哲学思想中“百家争鸣”的重点的问题。
                  （一）
    解放以来，从旧中国过来的知识分子经过了一系列的思想改造运动，思想上起了根本的变化。许多（虽然不是全数）著名的唯心主义哲学家都放弃了自己的唯心主义体系，而变成为马克思主义哲学的衷心支持者；多数的自然科学家也摆脱了资产阶级哲学观点的支配，而接受了辩证唯物主义观点的指导；一般的知识分子，除了极少数以外，也都成为马克思主义哲学的热烈拥护者。这是一个有重大意义的变化，这是中国思想史上的一件大事，同时也是人类思想史上的一件大事，将来的哲学史家在写这一段思想史的时候一定会大书特书的。
    现在我们仅谈谈一部分唯心主义者转变的情况。一些著名的唯心主义哲学家，在解放之初学习马克思主义哲学的时候，实在也有一些勉强，对于自己的一套旧思想实在也有“敝帚自珍”的心情。然而，经过学习与讨论之后，经过了内心的思想斗争之后，他们逐渐改变了。过了一段时间，数量的变化引起了性质的变化，许多人的立场，观点，方法，都有了一个大转变。用中国的老话来说，他们对于马克思主义哲学，真是“尽弃其学而学焉”，而且达到“中心悦而诚服也”的境地。他们确然认识了唯心主义的谬妄与危害，而领会到了唯物主义的正确与有效。他们认识到：惟有马克思主义哲学才是符合于事实的真理，才是引导人们达到人类最高理想的指针。
    许多唯心主义者转变为唯物主义者，这证明什么呢？这证明了马克思主义真理的巨大说服力，这更证明了马克思主义社会存在决定社会意识的命题的正确性。解放以来，我们的经济制度根本改变了，阶级关系经过了天翻地复的变革，社会生活有了本质的转化。旧唯心主义的阶级根源逐渐消失了；革命事业的胜利更证明了马克思主义力量的伟大，证明了马克思主义才是唯一的救国救民的真理。这些事实不能不影响旧的唯心主义者的意识。于是，随着他们的政治立场的转换，他们也就进入马克思主义的大门，开始以同情的眼光领会辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的理论，终于放弃了过去的哲学偏见。
    解放以来许多唯心主义者的转变，是马克思主义在哲学战线上的又一次的大胜利，是中国共产党的思想工作的巨大成就，是中国共产党的团结改造知识分子的英明政策的光辉的果实。
    在思想改造的过程中，也有过一些缺点。由于教条主义的流行，许多改造过来的哲学工作者都受到教条主义的束缚，不敢根据事实的分析提出自己的独创的见解。同时，由于时间的短暂，思想改造也有不细致不深入的地方。这个表现在，许多人的改造仅仅作到了“尽弃其学”，而对于旧日所学没有进行精细的分析与检查。“三反”运动的时候有一个口号是“丢掉包袱”。后来包袱是丢掉了，但那包袱里边到底有些什么东西，却没有来得及仔细检查。头脑中的包袱本来是内在的东西，本来不是像丢掉外边的包袱那样容易抛弃的，必须将其中的东西一一检查，病态的东西要用小刀一件一件的割除，而健康的东西却仍然应该保存下来。这是一个长期的过程。过去的思想改造在这方面是有缺点的。虽然如此，但是，在思想改造过程中，许多知识分子的旧思想的突出的病根还是检查出来了，还是割除了。所以，多数的从旧中国过来的知识分子的转变是衷心的转变，这也是应该承认的。
    郑昕先生在“开放唯心主义”的文章中也谈到思想改造的问题。郑先生所提出的见解是敏锐的，然而有美中不足的地方，就是，文章对于旧哲学工作者的思想改造的成果未免有估计不够之处。郑先生说：“解放以来，我们的政治觉悟普遍地提高了，但我们唯心主义的学术思想却原封未动或动得不多。我们既是唯物主义者又是唯心主义者：在公开的场合是唯物主义者，在书斋里是唯心主义者。在政治上是唯物主义者，在学术思想上是唯心主义者。这是我们的矛盾。”这所说的情况也是有的，然而决不是普遍的情况。据我自己几年来的观察与了解，多数的唯心主义者确已转换了阵营，在书斋中也站在唯物主义方面来了。然而，郑先生文章中所谓“隐藏着的唯心主义思想和公开的政治热情，‘两峰对峙，双水分流’，各不相搅”，也就不是符合实际情况的估计了。
    郑先生所讲的，大概也有其事实的根据，然而似乎不免以局部的现象当作一般的情况。据我看来，许多从旧中国过来的哲学工作者接受马克思主义哲学，不是表面的，不是形式主义的，而是内心的，是经过一番内在的思想斗争的。
    郑先生文章认为，百家争鸣的政策“对从旧中国走过来的广大知识分子是一个思想解放”。这所谓“思想解放”应该如何了解呢？文章中又说过：“这就给有唯心主义思想的人以无限自由的感觉”。似乎所谓“思想解放”乃是指唯心主义者获得辩护自己的观点之自由而言。关于这一点，我的看法也有些不同。我认为，假如说“百家争鸣”是一种“思想解放”，那应该是对于教条主义的解放，对于那些妨害思想发展的清规戒律的解放，从此创造性的思想可以在事实的基础上自由自在地飞翔。在唯物主义者也是如此。至于唯心主义思想得到了辩护的自由，那倒是次要的事情。
                  （二）
    郑昕先生的文章中谈到对于唯心主义哲学的评价的问题，提出了许多透辟的看法，这些是我完全同意的。尤其是，郑先生指出：现代的唯心主义，“在认识论（和逻辑）方面，有它细致和深入的一面，尽管是歪曲的、片面的”。这是实事求是的观察，是完全正确的。在这里，关于唯心主义的评价的问题，我再作一些简单的补充。
    中国革命是在马克思列宁主义指导之下进行，并在马克思列宁主义指导之下达到辉煌的成功的。在新中国的新社会中，马克思主义哲学应该是占统治地位的思想，这是当然的事情。然而为什么还允许唯心主义有宣传的自由呢？这就关联到哲学思想发展的规律以及哲学理论斗争的特点了。
    哲学的发展是唯物主义与唯心主义相互斗争的过程。唯物主义是在与唯心主义进行斗争之中成长发展起来的。在阶级社会中是如此，在社会主义社会中怎样呢？是否在社会主义革命成功以后，唯心主义就自然消灭，惟有唯物主义巍然独存呢？这个问题，陆定一部长的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的文章给我们以明确的回答：“人民内部也有不一致的地方，在思想上有唯物主义和唯心主义的分别，这种分别，在阶级还存在的时候会有，在阶级消灭以后还会有，一直到共产主义社会还会有。”这就说明了唯心主义不仅有阶级的根源，而且还有认识论的根源。在阶级消灭之后，唯心主义仍然会存在，在社会主义社会中，哲学领域内仍然是唯物主义与唯心主义斗争的局面。
    既然唯心主义还存在，与其让它在伪装的隐藏的形式下存在，何如使它公开化，给它以宣传的自由呢？唯心主义公开化，就更便利于哲学思想斗争的展开，更便利于思想的活跃，更便利于理论水平的提高。这里牵涉到唯心主义在哲学史中的作用的问题。唯心主义在哲学史上是否仅仅起消极的有害的作用呢？事实上不是那样。唯心主义也有它的助长思想发展的一面。它看到了许多唯物主义者所忽略的事实，它看到了许多不易解释的现象，它更注意到许多不易解决的困难问题。例如，主体有能动作用这件事实常为过去的唯物主义者所忽视，而唯心主义者却观察到了。人类认识客观事物，是一个曲折的过程，其中有许多不易解释的现象，有许多不易解决的问题，唯心主义者也特别注意到了。但是，唯心主义者曲解了所看到的事实，过分夸大了困难的问题，于是就陷入于错误之中。然而它所提出的问题还是需要加以研究的。所以唯心主义的思想学说可能有助于唯物主义理论的丰富与提高。
    哲学理论斗争有其特点。哲学理论斗争不是简单的运用强力的斗争，而是一种细致的深入的通过理论分析的斗争。一笔抹煞的办法实际上是不能达到解决思想问题的效果的。近几年来对于唯心主义的批判，往往有简单化的毛病。有时给错误的思想扣上一顶唯心主义帽子，就以为解决了问题，其实问题并没有解决。对于唯心主义的许多论点，是必须加以仔细的分析的，必须以有力的论证加以明锐的辩驳。这样，才能使唯心主义者认输，才能使唯物主义的内容更进一步地丰富起来。
    总之，容许唯心主义有宣传的自由，不仅无伤于唯物主义的威信，反而可以促进唯物主义的繁荣。
                  （三）
    哲学思想范围内的百家争鸣的重点何在？是否就在于容许唯心主义自由宣传呢？我以为不是的。在社会主义建设的过程中，在社会主义社会建成之后，哲学领域内的百家争鸣，决不仅是唯物主义与唯心主义之间的争鸣，而更重要的是唯物主义阵营内部的不同学派之间的争鸣。假如过分强调唯心主义的争鸣，那也是错误的。
    在社会主义的社会中，容许唯心主义参加“百家争鸣”，这是一个崭新的提法；在马克思主义哲学唯物主义的基本原则的指导之下，可以成立不同的学派，这也是崭新的英明的方针。
    近几年来，有一种风气颇为流行，就是，一切思想言论尽力求其合乎某种标准。一个问题只允许有一种答案，一个学说只允许有一个解释。假如那答案或解释是全面的，还好；假如不免有片面性，那就有很大的流弊了。应该承认，对于学术问题的正确结论，常常不是短时间内所能得到的。真理固然只有一个，但达到这一个真理的过程却往往是曲折的复杂的。不同意见的争论乃是必须经过的道路。因而，具有不同方法不同见解的不同学派的出现，应该是一种合乎规律的现象。
    唯物主义的基本原则是确定不移的。但是，事物更新不已，问题也就层出不穷。客观实际的内容是丰富的繁杂的错综的，包括众多不同的方面。而每一个研究者的见闻都是有限的，不免各有所“见”，各有所“蔽”。唯物主义基本原则指导之下的不同学派的不同学说，应该是客观实际的不同方面的反映。这些不同的学说，虽然彼此不同，却也可以互相补足。所以，学派的成立，应该是繁荣学术研究、提高理论水平的有力保证。
    唯物主义哲学的不同学派之间，可以而且应该结成一种联盟。列宁在“论战斗唯物主义底意义”中曾经教导我们说：“战斗唯物主义者为要执行自己所应执行的工作，除了与那些不是共产党员的彻底唯物主义者成立联盟之外，同样还必须——甚至更加必须——同现代自然科学中那些趋向于唯物主义，不怕反对现时在所谓‘知识人士’中盛行的唯心主义及怀疑主义哲学倾向而大胆捍卫和宣传唯物主义的人们成立联盟。”这是一个有非常的重大的意义的指示，这是一个到现在仍然有实际意义的指示。不同身分（党与非党的）不同训练（哲学家或自然科学家）的唯物主义者应该成立联盟；对于具体的问题持有不同的见解的唯物主义者也应该成立联盟。
    唯物主义者的联盟当然是对于唯心主义进行战斗的联盟。唯心主义虽然不一定是敌人的思想，然而在唯物主义者看来，却不能不说是思想上的敌人。唯心主义不一定以反动阶级立场为依据；然而却可以作为资产阶级腐朽思想残余的藏身所。所以，宣传唯物主义的自由，唯物主义者批评唯心主义思想的自由，是首先应该尊重的。
    在我们正进行伟大的社会主义建设的新中国，马克思主义的唯物主义哲学应当是占统治地位的思想，这就保证了科学的唯物主义的应有地位。同时，却又允许唯心主义参加“百家争鸣”，这又保证了思想自由的完全的充分的实现。我们今天的中国学术界，正处在一个科学思想高度昂扬的时代，也正处在一个人民的思想获得充分自由的时代。这正是充满了无限光明的伟大时代。
