Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, January 17th. The Chinese Art Troupe, after a thirty-day friendly visit to Burma, has returned to Kunming in batches over the past three days, the 15th, 16th, and 17th.

The head of the art troupe, Wu Wen, told reporters this afternoon: "The art troupe received meticulous hospitality from the Burmese government and people, and we have repeatedly expressed our gratitude to the Burmese government for this." He said that approximately more than 100,000 Burmese people watched the art troupe's performances. The Burmese people deeply love Chinese art. In Rangoon, when the art troupe performed in a theater that previously only accommodated a maximum of 5,000 people, it was packed with more than 7,000 people at one time.

    我访缅艺术团回国
    新华社昆明17日电　在缅甸进行了三十天的友好访问后，中国艺术团已经在15、16、17三天分批回到昆明。
    艺术团团长吴文今天下午告诉记者说：“艺术团受到了缅甸政府和人民无微不至的招待，对这一点我们曾经向缅甸政府再三地表示了感谢”。他说，大约有十万多缅甸人民观看了艺术团的演出。缅甸人民十分热爱中国艺术。在仰光，艺术团在一个过去最多只容纳过五千人的剧院里演出时，一次就挤满了七千多人。
