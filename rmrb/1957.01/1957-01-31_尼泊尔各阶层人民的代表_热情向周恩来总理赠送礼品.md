Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, January 29th (Delayed Dispatch) At a reception held by the Nepal-China Friendship Association on the afternoon of the 28th, representatives from all strata of the people presented Premier Zhou Enlai with a variety of gifts to express the Nepalese people’s friendship towards China. The gifts were diverse, including artworks created by Nepalese artists, writers, sculptors, and artisans, as well as hand-woven fabrics made by farming families, beautiful bouquets, and Nepalese specialty fruits.

    The representative of the Nepalese Women’s Association delivered a welcome speech while presenting the gifts, praising the achievements of Chinese women and inviting Ms. Soong Ching Ling to visit Nepal.

    The chairman of the Nepal-China Friendship Association, Poorna Bahadur, said in his welcome speech that the Chinese Premier's visit was an epoch-making event in the history of our two countries. He said: As the spirit of the Bandung Resolutions is increasingly consolidated, Asian countries should control their own destiny and should establish goodwill and exchange experiences in domestic development with each other. Bahadur said that the Chinese government's recent proposal to assist Nepal has confirmed this, and we thank the Chinese government for its assistance. He spoke of the long-standing friendship and cultural exchanges between the two countries, saying: "In the Nepalese language, when the word 'China' is used as an adjective, it means very good, beautiful, and very sweet, which shows the loving attitude of our people towards China and the Chinese people."

    In his reply, Zhou Enlai praised the work of the association and said that the task of developing friendship is not only the work of the government. The best way to consolidate the friendship between the two countries is to enable the people of both countries to have the fullest understanding and sympathy for each other. He also said, "Regardless of size, every country contributes to the common cultural treasure of mankind, and every country has advantages worth learning from other countries."

    Prime Minister Acharya and cabinet ministers attended the reception.

    据新华社加德满都29日电（迟到）在尼泊尔—中国友好协会28日下午举行的招待会上，各阶层人民的代表向周恩来总理赠送各种各样的礼物以表示尼泊尔人民对中国的友谊。礼物的种类多种多样，有尼泊尔的艺术家、作家、雕刻家和手工艺艺人创作的艺术品，也有农民家庭制造的手织布，美丽的花束和尼泊尔特产的水果。
    尼泊尔妇女协会的代表在赠礼时致欢迎词，称赞中国妇女取得的成就，并且邀请宋庆龄女士到尼泊尔访问。
    尼泊尔—中国友好协会的主席普尔纳·巴哈杜尔在致欢迎词的时候说，中国总理的访问在我们两国的历史上是一个划时代的事件。他说：由于万隆决议的精神日益巩固，亚洲国家应该自己掌握自己的命运，应该互相建立善意和交流国内发展的经验。巴哈杜尔说，中国政府最近关于援助尼泊尔的建议已经确证了这一点，我们感谢中国政府的援助。他谈到两国间悠久的友谊和文化交流，他说：“在尼泊尔的语言中，把‘中国’这个字眼作形容词用时，是表示非常好、美丽、非常甜蜜的意思，这说明我国人民对于中国和中国人民所抱的喜爱的态度。”
    周恩来在致答词时赞扬了协会的工作，并且说发展友谊的任务并不光是政府的工作。巩固两国友谊的最好方法，就是使两国人民彼此具有最充分的了解和同情。他又说，“国无论大小，每一国都对人类共同的文化宝库有所贡献，每一国都有值得别国学习的优点”。
    阿查里雅首相和内阁大臣们都出席了招待会。
