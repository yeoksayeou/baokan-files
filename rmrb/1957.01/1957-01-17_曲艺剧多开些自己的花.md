    Folk Art Drama Should Bloom More of its Own Flowers
    Tang Shi
    Not long ago, during the annual performance review of the Beijing Municipal Opera Troupe, I saw several plays performed by the Beijing Municipal Folk Art Troupe, and I felt I had a few small thoughts to share.
    I am not very familiar with folk art, but I have listened to it a few times. I think there are many good things in folk art programs. These traditional folk art programs have a very good foundation, whether in music or in the performers' performances. The language of the lines is also very concise and vivid, and the descriptions of the characters' psychology and personality are detailed and profound. For example, "Daiyu's Autumn Sorrow" has a very lyrical style, and it highlights Daiyu's aloof personality of not being content with mediocrity and her desire to pursue a pure love life. Both the writing of people and the scenery are unique. If these excellent folk art programs are adapted into folk art dramas and creatively arranged, they can be completely "established" on the stage.
    However, the Beijing Municipal Folk Art Troupe did not do this. Most of the folk operas they performed were adaptations of existing operas from other opera genres, and they also adopted the existing Pingju opera performance style in their performances!
    From the several plays I saw by the Beijing Municipal Folk Art Troupe: the performance of "Women's Representative" was quite successful. However, because this play was originally a spoken drama, the approach to this performance was basically also that of a spoken drama. The actors rarely used opera performance techniques on stage, and even less did they utilize the bold performance methods of folk art performers with their waving arms and sleeves; there were practically no body movements, and there were many naturalistic performances, such as bringing out a foot basin to wash feet on stage. "Borrowing the New Year" and "Hunting Birds" were performed by two young actors, and they performed them very movingly. However, both of these plays, from the repertoire to the performance, were basically from Shaoyang Flower Drum Opera, and the addition of some formulaic performances from Pingju opera further detracted from their appeal. As for "Meeting on the Road," it was in the style of Huangmei Opera plus Pingju opera performance, but it lost the original simple style of Huangmei Opera. In short, these plays were all transplanted from other opera genres, and these plays have become the representative works of the Beijing Folk Art Troupe and are included in the annual performance review, which cannot but make people feel regret!
    Why don't folk art workers adapt their many good and dramatic traditional folk art programs into folk operas for performance? Is it that they are greedy for ready-made things and specialize in adapting good plays from other opera genres? Is this the path that folk opera should take?

    曲艺剧多开些自己的花
    唐湜
    不久前，在北京市戏曲剧团举行的年终汇报演出中，我看到了北京市曲艺团演出的几个戏，觉得有一点小小的感想可以谈一谈。
    我对曲艺不是很熟悉的，但也听过几次。我觉得曲艺节目中有很多好东西。这些传统的曲艺节目，无论在音乐上或者演唱者的表演上，都有很好的基础。台词的语言也非常简练生动，对于人物的心理和性格的描写是细致入微的。例如“黛玉悲秋”，就很有抒情风格，而且把黛玉那种不甘庸俗的孤傲的性格和她的追求纯洁的爱情生活的愿望表现得很突出，写人写景都有独到的地方。如果把这些优秀的曲艺节目改成曲艺剧，创造性地作一番安排，是完全可以在舞台上“立”起来的。
    但是北京市曲艺团却没有这样做。他们演出的曲剧，大半都是搬演别的戏曲的现成戏，在表演上也采用了现成的评剧演法！
    从我所看到的北京市曲艺团的几个戏来说：“妇女代表”的演出是相当成功的。但是因为这个戏原来是话剧，这次演出的路子基本上也是话剧的。演员在舞台上很少运用戏曲的表演手法，更没有发挥曲艺艺人的那种挥臂舞袖的大胆的表演方法；身段简直等于没有，自然主义的表演倒不少，如在舞台上端出脚盆洗足等。“借年”和“打鸟”是两位年轻的演员演的，演得很动人。但这两个戏从剧目到表演基本上也是人家邵阳花鼓戏的，且由于羼入一些评剧表演中的公式化的演法，就更使它减色了。至于“路遇”则是黄梅戏的路子加评剧的表演，但又失去了黄梅戏原先的朴质的风格。总之这几个戏都是从别的剧种中移植过来的，而这几个戏却成了北京曲艺团的代表作，列入年终的汇报演出，这就不能不令人感到遗憾了！
    为什么曲艺工作者不把自己的那么多好的有戏剧性的传统曲艺节目编成曲剧上演呢？难道贪图现成，专门搬演别的剧种的好戏，是曲剧应该走的道路吗？
