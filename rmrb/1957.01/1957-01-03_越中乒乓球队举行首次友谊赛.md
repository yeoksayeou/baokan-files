Xinhua News Agency, December 31st – The table tennis teams of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and China clashed for the first time this afternoon in the competition hall of the Beijing Gymnasium. The Chinese team won all matches: five men's singles, one men's doubles, and one women's singles, each by a score of 3-0.

The Vietnamese team members all use a penhold grip. Their strength lies in the fact that each player can attack and defend. The Chinese team members have more tactical variations; they frequently use position-changing power shots combined with soft strokes to gain the initiative in the matches.

The results of today's matches are as follows: Men's Singles: Wang Chuanyao defeated Huang Deguan, Fu Qifang defeated Phan Huu Canh, Jiang Yongning defeated Nguyen Khac Thinh, Zhuang Jiafu defeated Bui Duc Long, Hu Bingquan defeated Yang Qixing; Men's Doubles: Wang Chuanyao and Fu Qifang defeated Huang Deguan and Bui Duc Long; Women's Singles: Sun Meiying defeated Trinh Thi Nhuan.

The table tennis team of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will hold two matches with the Beijing table tennis team on January 5th and 6th, 1957.

    越中乒乓球队举行首次友谊赛
    新华社31日讯　越南民主共和国乒乓球队今天下午同中国乒乓球队在北京体育馆的比赛馆中第一次交锋，中国队在五场男子单打、一场男子双打和一场女子单打比赛中，都以三比○获胜。
    越南队的队员都是横握球拍打球的，他们的优点是每个人都能攻能守。中国队队员的战术变化较多，他们经常用变换方位的猛抽结合轻打等办法在比赛中争取主动。
    今天各场比赛的结果如下：男子单打：王传耀胜黄德光，傅其芳胜潘友景，姜永宁胜阮克盛，庄家富胜裴德龙，胡炳权胜杨其兴；男子双打：王传耀、傅其芳胜黄德光、裴德龙；女子单打：孙梅英胜郑氏润。
