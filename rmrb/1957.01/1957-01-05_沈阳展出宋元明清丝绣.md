Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 3rd: The Northeast Museum began a month-long exhibition in Shenyang on New Year's Day featuring silk embroidery from the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Among the seventy-nine exhibits are many rare treasures, from which one can gain a general understanding of the development of brocade, kesi (cut silk tapestry), and embroidery techniques during the four dynasties of Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing.

Among the exhibits is the Song Dynasty brocade masterpiece "Ritual Phoenix Picture," which uses various bright colored threads to compose a scene of hundreds of birds paying homage to the phoenix. The dance of the birds and the blossoming of the magnolias are exquisitely crafted. There are also works by Zhu Kerou, a famous Kesi master representing the highest technology of Song Dynasty kesi, which are as precise and detailed as paintings. Song Dynasty embroidery masterpieces "Fairyland Crane Crossing", "Bamboo Plum Parrot", "Double Begonia Birds", and many silk fabrics specially made for Qianlong by the Jiangnan Weaving Factory of the Qing Dynasty are also exhibited here.

    沈阳展出宋元明清丝绣
    据新华社沈阳3日讯　东北博物馆从元旦开始，在沈阳举办为期一月的宋、元、明、清丝绣展览会。在七十九件展品中很多是稀有的珍品，从中可以了解到宋元明清四代的织锦、刻丝、刺绣等工艺的一个发展梗概。
    在陈列品中，有宋代织锦代表作“仪凤图”，它用各种鲜明的色线，组成百鸟朝凤的画面，其中群鸟的舞姿和玉兰花的怒放，极尽工巧之能事。还有代表宋代刻丝的最高技术的刻丝名家朱克柔的作品，精密细致俨如绘画。宋代刺绣代表作“瑶台跨鹤”“梅竹鹦鹉”、“海棠双鸟”，清代江南织造厂专为乾隆制作的不少丝织品，也在这里展出。
