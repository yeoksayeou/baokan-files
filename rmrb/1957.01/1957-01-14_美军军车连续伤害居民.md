Taiwan Situation

Xinhua News Agency report: According to Taiwan newspapers, Martinez, a corporal with the U.S. Air Force's 13th Air Force, drove a jeep recklessly in Chiayi City on the evening of the 25th of last month. On Zhongshan Road, Xinrong Street, and Minzu Road, he successively killed Jiang Rubin, an Air Force mechanic of the Chiang army, and three other citizens. After Martinez killed people in a speeding car, the U.S. 13th Air Force's Taiwan-based organization believed that the U.S. military enjoyed extraterritoriality in Taiwan and refused to hand him over to the Taiwan authorities' court for trial.

Shortly before the Chiayi tragedy, several Taiwan residents had already been run over and killed by U.S. military vehicles. For example, a level-two photographer from the U.S. "Taiwan Defense Command" drove a car and killed two women, Cai Yu and another, in Shilin Town, Taipei County. Chen Xiuqin, a seven-year-old elementary school girl from Xizhi Township, Taipei County, was run over and killed by a U.S. military truck traveling from Keelung to Taipei City. Xiang Chongwen, an elementary school student from Yangmei Town, Taoyuan County, had his left leg broken by a U.S. citizen driving a car and became disabled. These U.S. soldiers and U.S. citizens who drove and injured Taiwan residents are not subject to the sanctions of Taiwan authorities' laws.

    美军军车连续伤害居民
    新华社讯　台湾报纸消息，美国空军第十三航空队下士马丁尼兹，在上月二十五日晚上驾驶吉普车在嘉义市横冲直撞，在中山路、新荣街、民族路一连撞死蒋军空军机械士姜儒滨和另外三名市民。马丁尼兹飞车杀人后，美国第十三航空队驻台湾机构认为美军在台湾享有治外法权，拒绝把他交给台湾当局的法庭审理。
    在嘉义惨剧发生前不久，已经有台湾居民多人被美国军车辗死。如美军“协防台湾司令部”的一名二级摄影士驾车在台北县士林镇撞毙蔡玉等两名妇女。台北县汐止乡七岁的小学女生陈秀琴被由基隆开往台北市的美军大卡车辗死。台湾桃园县杨梅镇小学生向崇文被一名美侨驾车折断左腿，成为残废。这些驾车伤害台湾居民的美国军人和美侨，都不受台湾当局法律的制裁。
