Without machines, industry cannot develop. Therefore, the role of the machine manufacturing industry in socialist industrialization is as important as the heart to a person. Our country's machine manufacturing industry, as the heart of industry, is developing rapidly. Many dilapidated and backward factories that could only repair and assemble parts in the past have now been gradually transformed into modern machine manufacturing plants with a certain scale and capable of manufacturing machines themselves. New, large-scale modern machine manufacturing plants are being established one after another. New products are also constantly being added, and many new products have caught up with international advanced levels.

From 1953 to the present, 33 newly built and renovated machine manufacturing factories above the quota have been put into production in our country, which marks a major step forward in our country's machine manufacturing industry towards an independent and modern road. (Attached pictures)

	A new type of precision vertical lathe has been successfully trial-produced at the Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Plant. This lathe weighs 34 tons and can process large parts that are 1.6 meters high and more than 2 meters in diameter. It is an indispensable and important equipment for factories that manufacture machine tools, motors, mining machinery and other products. Ding Fengling (Qiqihar Daily)

	After the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant and the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant were put into production, according to the original design plan, the annual production capacity of generators in our country increased by 420,000 kilowatts. Now, these two factories have produced 15,000-kilowatt hydro-generator sets and 12,000-kilowatt turbo-generators. According to the current production capacity, these two factories can also produce hydro-generator sets with a unit capacity of 50,000 kilowatts and turbo-generators with a unit capacity of 25,000 kilowatts; while in 1947, the year with the relatively high generator output in our country before liberation, only more than 22,000 kilowatts of generators were produced, and none of them had a unit capacity exceeding 500 kilowatts. The picture shows the test run of a 12,000-kilowatt turbo-generator. Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Putao

	Passenger and cargo ship with a full load displacement of 2,648.8 metric tons.

	New type single-arm planer produced by Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Plant.

	Electric meters and instruments produced by Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory.

	The new "parallel winding machine" that has been put into production.

	The Shenyang Cable Factory, which was put into production not long ago, will account for two-thirds of the total number of cable and wire products in the country annually, and can produce several types of high-voltage cables and ultra-high-voltage cables that used to be imported. This kind of cable can send electricity to distant cities and villages. The picture shows one of the main workshops of the Shenyang Cable Factory - the bare wire workshop.

	In mid-July last year, the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant successfully trial-produced a heavy-duty plate feeder that our country had never produced before. This machine has a solid structure, a large load capacity, and can undertake heavy feeding tasks. It is suitable for various mines. The picture shows workers in the assembly workshop dismantling the successfully trial-produced feeder, preparing to transport it out. Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Piyong

	The Harbin Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory, which was put into production at the beginning of last year, has produced more than 1,700 specifications of precision measuring tools and cutting tools in the past two years, supplying the needs of manufacturing automobiles, machine tools, ships, locomotives, electric meters and other products. This is milling worker Wang Zengrong carefully processing cutting tools.

	During the period of my country's first five-year plan, there were more than 80 machine manufacturing factories above the quota planned to be constructed. Factories currently under construction produce tractors, locomotives, ships, machine tools, heavy machinery, and large generators. The picture shows the general assembly workshop of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant hoisting roof trusses. The parts produced in various workshops will be assembled into complete tractors here in the future.

	The modern Luoyang Ball Bearing Factory is under construction. After one year of construction, the various projects of this factory are nearing completion and are scheduled to be put into production this year. In the future, the ball bearings produced by this factory annually can be used for more than 100,000 tractors. The picture shows the installation of a new type of boring machine.

	In the emerging Harbin industrial zone, a brand new factory has appeared - the Harbin Boiler Factory. This factory specializes in manufacturing modern medium and high pressure boilers, has been basically completed, and began production in the third quarter of last year. The picture shows a corner of the interior of the main factory building.

    机器制造工业的新成就
    没有机器，工业就没法发展。所以，机器制造工业在社会主义工业化中的作用，正像心脏对于人一样的重要。作为工业心脏的我国机器制造业，正在迅速发展着。过去许多破烂落后、只能修配零件的工厂，现在已经逐步被改造成为具有一定规模，能自己制造机器的现代化机械制造厂。新的规模巨大的现代化机械制造厂正在一个接着一个建立起来。新的产品也在不断地增加，有许多新产品已经赶上了国际先进水平。
    从1953年到现在，我国已有三十三个限额以上的新建和改建的机器制造工厂投入生产，这标志着我国机器制造工业已经向独立的现代化的道路上迈进了一大步。（附图片）

    一种新式的精密立式车床已在齐齐哈尔第一机床厂试制成功。这台车床有三十四吨重，可以加工高一点六公尺、直径二公尺以上的大部件，它是制造机床、电机、矿山机械等产品的工厂不可缺少的重要设备。　丁凤岭摄（齐齐哈尔日报社稿）
    哈尔滨电机厂和上海电机厂投入生产后，按原设计方案，使我国发电机年产能力增加了四十二万瓩。现在，这两个厂已经生产一万五千瓩的水轮发电机组和一万二千瓩的汽轮发电机。按目前生产能力，这两个厂还可以生产单位容量五万瓩的水轮发电机组和二万五千瓩的汽轮发电机；而解放前我国发电机产量比较高的一年1947年生产的发电机，只有两万二千多瓩，其中单位容量没有超过五百瓩的。图为一万二千瓩汽轮发电机试车的情形。　新华社记者　杨溥涛摄
