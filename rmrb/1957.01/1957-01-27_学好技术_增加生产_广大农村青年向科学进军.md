    Learn Technology Well, Increase Production
    Broad Rural Youth March Towards Science
    Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The broad masses of rural youth throughout the country have extensively launched various activities to learn agricultural science and technology, which has played a significant role in developing agricultural production.
    After initially mastering agricultural science and technology, some rural youth in certain regions have created many new records for high yields. Wang Baojing, the youth director of the Fenghuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liquan County, Shaanxi Province, and the cooperative members, after adopting new technical measures in cornfields from deep plowing, seed selection, dense planting, detasseling, hybridization to irrigation, created a high yield record of 1,500 jin per mu of corn. Wang Baojing's high-yield experience with corn has been widely promoted throughout Shaanxi Province. According to statistics from only five counties, more than 97,000 young people have systematically studied this experience, and more than 800 youth production teams and planting groups striving for 1,000 jin of corn per mu have emerged. Yu Dagan, the youth director of the Guanghui Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dongying Township, Fuqing County, Fujian Province, after several years of meticulous experimentation, created the province's highest yield of 12,500 jin per mu of sweet potatoes. Young people have not only created high-yield records in production, but have also improved and created many novel farming tools, increasing efficiency by several to dozens of times. The green manure treading machine created by the Shangguan Village Technical Research Group in Shang'an Township, Quan County, Guangxi Province, can increase efficiency by twelve to twenty-two times. Many young people have learned operational methods such as pesticide pest control, foliar fertilization, and seedling planting. Some young people have also learned to use sprayers and have initially mastered the technology of repairing sprayers. In Hebei Province, nearly one million young people have learned the technology of artificial auxiliary pollination in cornfields, and artificial pollination has been carried out on 3.69 million mu of corn.
    Since the high tide of agricultural cooperation, the demand of the broad masses of rural youth to learn agricultural science and technology has been very urgent. They generally reflected: "Large cooperatives are good for increasing production, and we can only do it if we have technology." In Shanxi Province, 1.5 million rural youth participated in learning in 1956, and in Jiangxi Province, more than 50,000 people in the fourteen counties of Nanchang Prefecture alone participated in various learning organizations. Young people closely integrate technical learning with local production. Young people in corn-growing areas learned "artificial auxiliary pollination of corn"; young people in rice-growing areas promoted methods such as "small-seedling dense planting" and "new-style seedling fields." Many young people also actively learn from experienced old farmers. They go to the fields with old farmers and humbly ask them to guide their farming techniques. Young people are full of confidence in learning agricultural science and technology. "Learn technology well, increase production" and "marching towards agricultural science" have become the loudest slogans of the broad masses of rural youth.
    The activities of the broad masses of rural youth in learning agricultural science and technology have received strong support from the Communist Party, the Communist Youth League organizations, and agricultural cooperatives. Party organizations and agricultural cooperatives in various places have generally assigned special personnel to be responsible for leadership and have provided many favorable conditions for young people in their studies. Local Communist Youth League organizations have also cooperated with agricultural departments to adopt various methods such as contract teaching and learning, technical dissemination stations, technical training classes, technical research groups, planting groups, and agricultural technical schools to organize the broad masses of youth to learn technology. Some Communist Youth League organizations have also organized young people to visit, listen to reports from high-yield models, and hold discussions.

### 学好技术　增加生产  广大农村青年向科学进军

    学好技术　增加生产
    广大农村青年向科学进军
    新华社26日讯　全国各地广大农村青年，广泛展开了学习农业科学技术的各种活动，对发展农业生产起了巨大作用。
    有些地区的农村青年初步掌握农业科学技术以后，创造了许多丰产新纪录。陕西省醴泉县烽火农业生产合作社青年社主任王保京和社员一起，在玉米田里从深耕、选种、密植、去雄杂交到灌溉全部采用了新的技术措施以后，创造了玉米每亩一千五百斤的丰产纪录。王保京的玉米高额丰产经验已在陕西省各地普遍推广，仅据五个县的统计就有九万七千多青年系统地学习了这一经验，并且出现了八百多个争取亩产千斤玉米的青年生产队和种植组。福建省福清县东营乡光辉农业生产合作社青年社长余大干，经过了几年的精心试验，创制了甘薯亩产一万二千五百斤的全省最高产量。青年们不仅在生产上创造了丰产纪录，而且还改进和创造了许多新颖的耕作农具，提高了效率几倍到几十倍不等。广西省全县上安乡上灌村技术研究组创制的踩绿肥机，就可以提高效率十二倍到二十二倍。许多青年都学会了药剂除虫、根外施肥、育苗种植等操作方法。有些青年还学会了使用喷雾机，并且还初步掌握了修理喷雾机的技术。在河北省已有近百万青年学会了在玉米田里施行玉米人工辅助授粉的技术，施行人工授粉的玉米有三百六十九万亩。
    农业合作化高潮到来以后，广大农村青年学习农业科学技术的要求十分迫切。他们普遍反映：“社大好增产，有了技术才能办”。山西省在1956年有一百五十万农村青年参加学习，在江西省仅南昌专区的十四个县就有五万多人参加了各种学习组织。青年们都密切结合当地生产进行技术学习。在种植玉米地区的青年学习了“玉米人工辅助授粉”；水稻地区的青年推广了“小株密植”和“新式秧田”等方法。不少青年还积极向有经验的老农民学习，他们和老农民一起下地，虚心地请老农民指导耕种技术。青年们对学习农业科学技术充满了信心，“学好技术，增加生产”，“向农业科学进军”已成为广大农村青年最响亮的口号。
    广大农村青年学习农业科学技术的活动，得到了共产党和青年团组织以及农业社的大力支持。各地党组织和农业社普遍委派了专人负责领导，并且为青年提供了许多学习上的有利条件。各地团组织还协同农业部门采用了包教包学合同、技术传授站、技术训练班、技术研究组、种植小组和农业技术学校等各种方式，组织了广大青年学习技术。有的团组织还组织青年参观访问，听丰产模范报告和座谈。
