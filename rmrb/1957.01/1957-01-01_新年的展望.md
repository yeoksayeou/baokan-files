New Year's Prospects

    1957 has arrived. The people of our country, like the people of the world, are full of bright hopes for the new year.

    In the past year, the strength of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, the national independence movements of Asian and African countries, and the strength of all peace-loving and democratic forces around the world have grown tremendously.

    The most important international event of 1956 was the failure of the imperialist aggression plan against Egypt. The imperialist aggression group headed by the United States used economic power to oppress Egypt, interfered in Egypt's internal affairs, and forced Egypt to take the just action of nationalizing the Suez Canal Company. The governments of the United States, Britain, and France have been trying to seize the Suez Canal back from Egypt. Because of this attempt, British and French imperialists and Israeli aggressors brazenly launched a war of aggression against Egypt. However, their war adventure met with the resolute resistance of Egypt and the Arab countries, aroused the anger of peace-loving people all over the world, and deepened their domestic economic and political crises. Under the enormous pressure from all sides, especially from the Soviet Union, the British, French, and Israeli aggressor troops finally had to withdraw from Egyptian territory. Now, American imperialists are trying to replace British and French imperialists and restore colonial rule in Egypt. However, facts have fully proved that the anti-colonialist struggle of the oppressed peoples will surely win the final victory, and the colonialists' adventurous plans will inevitably go bankrupt. Due to the victory of Egypt's resistance, the liberation struggles of the oppressed nations have been greatly encouraged, imperialism has been greatly hit, and the internal contradictions of imperialism have also been sharpened.

    In 1956, imperialists took advantage of the opportunity of criticism and self-criticism within socialist countries to intensify their vicious anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-peace conspiracies. When the people of Hungary demanded that the government correct its mistakes in its work, the imperialists instigated Hungarian counter-revolutionaries to take the opportunity to create bloodshed, attempting to restore the reactionary regime of landlords and the bourgeoisie in Hungary. However, the strong forces of the socialist state and people crushed the counter-revolutionary offensive. In this way, imperialism suffered a serious defeat in Eastern Europe, just as it did in the Middle East.

    In 1957, imperialists will continue to carry out sabotage activities in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. However, their attempts to create new tensions will not succeed. On the contrary, due to the failure of imperialist aggression plans in 1956, we believe that the international situation will return to relaxation in 1957.

    1957 is the final year of our country's first Five-Year Plan. In this year, we will have full possibility to complete and over fulfill the various targets of national economic development.

    An extremely important aspect of our country's socialist cause—the great socialist transformation—was basically completed in 1956. Agricultural cooperation has been healthily realized nationwide, handicraft cooperation has also been basically completed, capitalist industry and commerce have achieved full-industry public-private partnership, and the socialist enthusiasm of the masses has been unprecedentedly high. Due to the criticism of right-leaning conservative ideas, all work has shown great progress.

    The total value of industrial production in 1956 increased by approximately 25%, which is the fastest growth rate in the past four years. The machinery manufacturing industry has made considerable progress in the past year, and its output value will increase by more than 51%. Among the 46 major products stipulated in the Five-Year Plan, the output of more than 20 products has reached the highest targets of the Five-Year Plan. This achievement is the result of the hard work of the working class and all the people of our country to increase production and practice economy.

    Agricultural production in 1956 suffered considerable losses because some areas suffered from severe disasters such as typhoons, floods, and droughts. However, due to the influence of the victory of agricultural cooperation throughout the country and the promotion of the high tide of increasing production, the output of major crops, especially grain and cotton, still increased. Grain output in 1956 increased by more than 20 billion jin compared to 1955. This shows that agricultural cooperation has demonstrated great superiority in the first year. It has already played a huge role in promoting our country's current agricultural production. Under the call of the Party and the government to strive for increased production, the peasants of our country fought against various disasters and worked diligently, achieving remarkable achievements.

    Basic construction in 1956 increased by about 64% compared to 1955, equivalent to the total workload of 1953 and 1954. All staff and workers on the basic construction front have made great efforts, so that the key projects stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan, especially the 156 projects, can be mostly completed as scheduled.

    In 1956, the labor productivity of state-owned industries increased by about 19.7% compared to 1955, and about 69% compared to 1952. In 1956, the average wage of staff and workers in various departments of the national economy increased by about 13% compared to 1955, and 33.5% compared to 1952. This fact shows that only on the basis of developing production and improving labor productivity is it possible to gradually improve people's lives.

    In 1956, the total retail sales of social commodities, the volume of railway freight turnover, etc. were also completed or over fulfilled. The production costs of the various industrial ministries of the Central Government decreased by an average of 7.3%.

    It can be determined that 1956 was a year in which our country's national economy tended to a comprehensive upsurge. Production and construction have greatly increased. People's lives have been improved to a certain extent, and the income of most peasants has also increased. All of these have laid a better foundation for the successful realization of the first Five-Year Plan.

    At this time of the year's renewal, looking back at the great achievements of the past year, our confidence in building socialism has become even stronger. But while seeing the achievements, we must also see the shortcomings in our work. Only in this way can we avoid arrogance and impetuosity and continue to move forward. In the great economic development of the past year, as the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out, there are components that are not completely interconnected in some aspects, and a small portion of investment and other expenditures were used inappropriately. We should sum up the experiences and lessons of the past year, rationally arrange this year's work, and put this year's annual plan on a fully reliable basis. We must ensure the completion and over fulfillment of the first Five-Year Plan, and actively prepare for the second Five-Year Plan.

    In arranging this year's plan, we should first pay attention to eliminating the phenomenon of separation between construction and production, so that each of our construction projects, especially key construction projects, is carefully considered; so that the auxiliary projects and various service facilities of the new industrial bases can be coordinated accordingly. In this way, after the completion of key construction projects, production can be carried out smoothly according to the planned plan, avoiding both excessive investment in non-productive construction and preventing the isolated acceleration of the speed of key construction projects. Secondly, we should eliminate the phenomenon of separation between production construction and the needs of people's lives. That is to say, the accumulation part of the national income used for construction—expanded reproduction—and the consumption part used for the needs of people's lives should have a correct proportion. It should be noted that the improvement of people's lives can only be gradual. The improvement of living standards should never exceed the possibility of the growth of production (especially the production of consumer goods). Our construction has made great progress, and people's lives have also been considerably improved compared to the past. But from the overall point of view, our economy is still very backward, and our material supply capacity is still very limited. Therefore, neither the speed of construction nor the speed of improving people's lives can be too fast. The state must have a certain accumulation, must ensure the proper handling of the most necessary and most important undertakings, and for some other projects, the speed should be appropriately slowed down. This is not for anything else, but for the overall interests of the people and the country.

    Our cause is always advancing. However, on the road forward, we may encounter some twists and turns, which is also very natural. Because the socialist cause we are engaged in is a great, arduous, and new cause unprecedented in the history of our country. It is inconceivable that we will always move forward without taking a few detours. However, after some twists and turns, overcoming shortcomings, we will learn the skills, and then we can move forward faster and achieve greater results.

    In order to ensure the complete realization of the 1957 national plan, we must base the development plans of various undertakings on a fully reliable basis, and we must carry out a universal movement of increasing production and practicing economy in industry, agriculture, commerce, and other aspects. Enterprises in industry that have raw materials and markets should strive to increase production within the scope permitted by the plan. Enterprises that urgently need the market but have some difficulties with raw materials should find ways to open up raw material sources, vigorously conserve raw materials on the premise of ensuring product quality, and strive to increase production. Enterprises with extremely difficult raw materials should carefully calculate, strictly economize, and further improve product quality and reduce costs. In all enterprises, non-production expenses must be reduced, and extravagance and waste must be eliminated. At present, there is still a lot of waste in central and local state organs, and measures should be taken immediately to vigorously streamline and economize. In the entire social life, we must advocate a diligent and thrifty style, especially leading staff members must care about the lives of the masses and share weal and woe with the masses. As long as we rely on the masses, work diligently and thriftily, and do all aspects of our work well, we will be able to further achieve new achievements.

    新年的展望
    1957年来到了。我国人民同全世界人民一样，对于新的一年满怀着光明的希望。
    在过去的一年中，以苏联为首的社会主义各国的力量、亚非各国民族独立运动的力量和全世界一切维护和平民主的力量，都有了巨大的增长。
    1956年国际间的最重要事件是帝国主义侵略埃及计划的失败。以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团用经济力量压迫埃及，干涉埃及内政，迫使埃及采取了收回苏伊士运河公司为国有的正义行动。美英法三国政府一直企图从埃及手中夺回苏伊士运河。由于这个企图，英法帝国主义者和以色列的侵略者悍然发动了对埃及的侵略战争。但是，他们的战争冒险遇到了埃及和阿拉伯各国的坚决反抗，激起了全世界爱好和平人民的愤怒，也加深了他们国内的经济危机和政治危机。在各方面巨大的压力特别是苏联的压力之下，英法和以色列的侵略军终于不得不从埃及的领土上撤退了。现在美帝国主义者正在企图代替英法帝国主义者，从新在埃及恢复殖民主义的统治。但是，事实已经完全证明，被压迫民族人民的反殖民主义的斗争必定会得到最后的胜利，殖民主义者的冒险计划必然彻底地破产。由于埃及抗战的胜利，被压迫民族解放斗争得到了巨大的鼓励，帝国主义受到了巨大的打击，帝国主义的内部矛盾也更加尖锐化了。
    在1956年内，帝国主义者利用社会主义国家内部展开批评和自我批评的时机，加紧地进行了凶恶的反共、反人民、反和平的阴谋活动。当匈牙利的人民群众要求政府纠正工作中的错误的时候，帝国主义者策动匈牙利的反革命分子乘机制造流血事件，企图在匈牙利恢复地主资产阶级的反动政权。但是，社会主义的国家和人民的坚强力量击溃了反革命的进攻。这样，帝国主义在东欧像在中东一样，遭到了严重的失败。
    在1957年，帝国主义者还将继续在中东和东欧进行破坏活动。但是他们制造新的紧张局势的企图，将不可能获得成功。相反，由于1956年帝国主义侵略计划的失败，我们相信，国际局势在1957年将从新走向和缓。
    1957年是我国第一个五年计划的最后一年。在这一年内，我们将有充分的可能完成和超额完成国民经济发展的各项指标。
    我国社会主义事业中极其重要的一个方面——伟大的社会主义改造，在1956年已经基本完成。农业合作化已经健康地在全国范围内基本上实现，手工业合作化也已基本上完成，资本主义工商业已经实现全行业公私合营，群众的社会主义积极性空前高涨。由于批判了右倾保守思想，各项工作表现了巨大的进步。
    1956年工业生产的总产值增长的速度约为25％，这是过去四年内增长速度最快的一年。机器制造业在上年度有了长足的发展，它的产值增长将达到51％以上。在五年计划规定的四十六种主要产品中，有二十多种产品的产量达到了五年计划的最高指标。这个成绩是我国工人阶级和全体人民辛勤努力增产节约的结果。
    1956年的农业生产，因为某些地区遭受了台风、水灾、旱灾等严重灾害，受到相当的损失。但是，由于全国农业合作化胜利的影响和增产高潮的推动，主要农作物特别是粮食和棉花的产量仍然有所增加。1956年的粮食产量比1955年增加了二百多亿斤。由此可见，农业合作化在第一年就表现了巨大的优越性。它对于我国目前的农业生产，已经起了巨大的推进作用。我国农民在党和政府努力增产的号召之下，向各种灾害作斗争，勤苦劳动，取得了显著成就。
    1956年的基本建设比1955年提高64％左右，相当于1953和1954两年工作量的总和。基本建设战线上的全体职工作了巨大努力，使第一个五年计划规定的重点工程，特别是一百五十六项工程，绝大部分可以如期完成。
    1956年国营工业的劳动生产率约比1955年提高19.7％，比1952年提高约69％。1956年国民经济各部门的工作人员平均工资比1955年提高13％左右，比1952年提高33.5％。这个事实说明，只有在发展生产、提高劳动生产率的基础上，才有逐渐改善人民生活的可能。
    在1956年，社会商品零售总额、铁路货运周转量等也都完成了或超额完成了计划。中央各工业部的生产成本平均降低了7.3％。
    可以确定地说，1956年是我国国民经济趋于全面高涨的一年。生产和建设都有了很大的增长。人民生活有了一定程度的改善，大部分农民的收入也有所增加。所有这些，都为胜利实现第一个五年计划打下了较好的基础。
    在这岁月更新的时候，回顾过去一年的巨大成就，我们建设社会主义的信心越发增强了。但是在看到成就的时候，也要同时看到工作中的缺点。这样我们才能不骄不躁，继续前进。在过去一年的经济的巨大发展中，如中国共产党第八届第二次中央全会所指出，在某些方面含有不完全互相衔接的成分，一小部分投资和其他开支使用得不恰当。我们应该总结过去一年的经验和教训，合理地安排今年的工作，把1957年的年度计划放在充分可靠的基础上。我们要保证完成和超额完成第一个五年计划，并且积极为第二个五年计划作好各种准备。
    在安排今年的计划中，首先应当注意消除建设和生产脱节的现象，使我们每一项建设，特别是重点建设，都经过周密的考虑；使新工业基地的辅助项目和各种服务性的设施，都能相应地配合进行。这样，在重点建设完成以后，就能够顺利地按照预定计划进行生产，既要避免把投资过多地使用在非生产性的建设上，又要防止孤立地加快重点建设的速度。其次，应当消除生产建设和人民生活需要之间脱节的现象。这就是说，国民收入中用于建设——扩大再生产的积累部分，和用于人民生活需要的消费部分，应该有正确的比例。要注意到人民生活的改善只能是渐进的。生活改善决不应该超过生产（尤其是消费资料生产）增长的可能性。我们的建设已经有了很大的进展，人民的生活比以前也已经有了相当的改进。但是从整个来看，我们的经济还很落后，物资的供应能力还很有限，因此，无论建设的速度和人民生活改善的速度都决不可以过快。国家必须有一定的积累，必须保证办好那些最必需最重要的事业，而对于其他的一些项目，应该适当地把速度放慢一些。这样做不是为了别的，而是为了人民和国家的全面利益。
    我们的事业永远是前进的。但是，在前进的道路上，有时会遇到某些曲折，这也是很自然的。因为我们所从事的社会主义事业，是我国历史上前所未有的一项伟大的艰巨的新事业。不能设想我们会一直前进，而不会走少许弯路。但是，经过了一些曲折，克服了缺点，我们就学到了本领，以后就可以更快地前进，取得更大的成绩。
    为了保证1957年国家计划的完满实现，我们必须把各项事业的发展计划建立在充分可靠的基础上，必须在工业、农业、商业及其它各个方面开展一个普遍的增产节约运动。工业中那些有原料有市场的企业，应当在计划许可的范围内努力增产。市场迫切需要而原料有些困难的企业，应当设法开辟原料来源，在保证产品质量的前提下，大力节约原材料，争取增产。原料十分困难的企业，应当精打细算，严格节约，进一步提高产品质量和降低成本。在一切企业中都必须减少非生产开支，杜绝铺张浪费现象。目前中央和地方的国家机关浪费现象仍然不少，应当立即采取措施，厉行精简节约。在整个社会生活中，要提倡勤俭朴素的风气，特别是领导工作人员必须关心群众生活，与群众共甘苦。只要我们依靠群众，克勤克俭，把各方面的工作都做到、做好，我们就能够进一步取得新的成就。
