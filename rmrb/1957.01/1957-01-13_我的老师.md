My Teacher
    Ma Ning

    Recently, a comrade mentioned to me that he was returning to Taiyuan. Speaking of Taiyuan, I couldn't help but think of my teacher, Comrade Luo Jianian, who worked there.
    In 1937, I transferred from a rural primary school to a private Shuren Primary School in the city. At the time, everyone said that this school was run by communists, a red school, and the principal, Luo Jianian, was a "communist element." I was young then and didn't quite understand. My impression of Teacher Luo was always one of hardship, simplicity, kindness, and approachability.
    Shortly after the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our hometown fell. On the very night the enemy was discovered, Teacher Luo Jianian led more than a dozen of us older students, bidding a sorrowful farewell to the school and moving to the western mountains. At night, the village was empty, without a single soul in sight. Our legs ached and were sore from walking. We didn't even dare to sit down and take a breath. Although Teacher Luo was an adult, he was very thin, especially his nearsighted eyes without glasses, which made it even more difficult for him to walk at night; but when crossing mountains and ridges, he always supported the younger students, fearing they would fall.
    One day, the rain fell incessantly from morning till night, and the turbid air made us feel even more tired. Everyone was drowsily huddled on a dirt pit, sleeping. At dusk, Teacher Luo woke us up and told us to get up and eat. After we drowsily finished a pot of porridge, we realized that Teacher Luo had not eaten anything. When the dry food was gone, there was nothing else to eat. What should we do? A few of us older children decided to sneak out and pick some wild apricots. When we brought the wild apricots to him, he waved his hand and said, "Don't sneak out casually in the future!" Then he bit open a wild apricot and chewed it. We asked him, "Teacher Luo, is it good?" He smiled and replied, "Not bad. As long as we have these apricots, we can survive!"
    During the war years, I hadn't heard from Teacher Luo for a long time. It wasn't until last year, through a chance encounter, that I met him in Taiyuan. At that time, he had just been transferred from the school to work as a leader at the Shanxi Provincial Museum. He squinted his nearsighted eyes at me, just like he did more than ten years ago, looking at me for a long time without recognizing me. When I said my name, he smiled and opened his eyes.
    "You still haven't gotten a pair of glasses?" I asked, wiping the rain off my glasses.
    "Yes, I haven't."
    "If your eyes are bad, you should get a pair to wear!"
    "I'm used to it. I can work without glasses."
    When I was his primary school student, he already suffered from severe nearsightedness. Now I'm wearing glasses, but he still hasn't. Is there really someone who is not influenced by their environment?
    In his living quarters, besides a narrow wooden plank bed supported by two wooden stools, there was only a small long table for writing. The wooden plank bed was covered with a cotton wadding mattress, a coarse white sheet, and a thin white cotton quilt. Three people standing in this room could barely turn around. When I saw his rolled-up trouser legs and cloth shoes splattered with mud, and then looked at my creaking leather shoes, I felt even more uneasy.
    Afterwards, a comrade who had been a student of Comrade Luo Jianian and was then the director of a factory in Shanxi told me that once they were at a meeting together. After the meeting, this comrade wanted to send him home in a car, but he insisted on not riding and walked back. Another comrade who had worked with him in the same area told me that he went out to meetings and always walked, no matter how far the road was. Once, after a meeting, it was already noon, and he still braved the summer heat and endured hunger, walking home from more than ten miles away. His wife asked him why he didn't eat something at a restaurant and then take the bus back. He said that walking back saved money and was more convenient.
    As the year draws to a cold end, I am reminded of the ancient saying, "Only when the year grows cold do we know that the pine and cypress are the last to wither." I deeply wish our beloved teacher well!

    我的老师
    马宁
    最近有一位同志跟我谈到他要回太原去。提起太原，我就不禁想起在那里工作的我的老师——罗家年同志来。
    1937年，我由一个乡村小学转学到城里一个私立树人小学校里。当时，大家都说，这所学校是共产党人办的，是个红色学校，校长罗家年就是一名“共产主义分子”。我那时年纪小，还不太懂。罗老师给我的印象始终是艰苦朴素、和蔼可亲的。
    抗日战争爆发后不久，我们的家乡就沦陷了。在发现敌人的当天晚上，罗家年老师带着我们十多个年纪较大一点的学生，沉痛地告别了学校向西山转移。夜里，村里空空荡荡，见不到一个人影。我们的两条腿走得又酸又痛。也不敢坐下来歇一口气。罗老师虽然是成年人了，他的身体却很瘦弱，特别是一双没有戴眼镜的近视眼，使他在夜里走路更感到吃力；但是在翻山越岭的时候，他却总要扶持着年龄较小的学生，深怕他们跌倒。
    有一天，雨从早到晚下个不停，浑浊的空气使我们愈加感到疲倦，大家都昏昏沉沉地挤在一个土坑上睡觉。黄昏时候，罗老师把我们叫醒了，要我们起来吃饭。当我们迷迷糊糊地把一锅稀饭吃光以后，才发觉罗老师什么都没有吃。干粮吃完了，旁的可吃的东西也没有，该怎么办呢？我们几个年纪较大的孩子决定悄悄溜到外面去采些野杏回来。当我们把野杏送给他时，他摆摆手说，“以后不要随便溜出去了！”随后他就咬开一只野杏咀嚼起来。我们问他：“罗老师，味道好不好？”他笑了笑回答说，“不错。只要有这样的杏子我们就能活下去！”
    在战争的日子里，好久我都没有听到过关于罗老师的消息。直到去年，因为一个偶然的机会，我在太原见到了他。那时他正由学校调到山西省博物馆来做领导工作不久。他和十多年前一样，眯缝起那双近视眼看着我，看了好久，还没有认出我这个突然到来的人。当我说出了我的名字时，他才笑了笑把两眼松开。
    “还没有配付眼镜戴啊？”我擦了擦自己眼镜上的雨水问他。
    “是啊，没有配。”
    “眼睛不好使，还是配付戴戴好啊！”
    “习惯啦，不戴眼镜也可以工作。”
    在我还是他的小学生时，他就已经患着深度近视眼病，现在我已经戴上近视眼镜了，他还没有戴。难道真的有一种人不受环境的左右吗？
    他的住室里，除了两只木凳支架着的一块窄窄的木板床外，只有一张用来写字的小长桌。木板床上铺着一条夹褥，一块粗白布单和一条薄薄的白棉被。三个人站在这个房里就有些转不过身来。我看到他那挽着的裤脚管和被泥水溅湿了的布便鞋，又看了看我那双咯吱咯吱作响的皮鞋的时候，我更感到有些不安了。
    事后，一位曾作过罗家年同志的学生、当时在山西一个工厂做厂长的同志告诉我说，有一次他们在一起开会，会完后，这位同志要派汽车送他回家，他坚持不坐，走回去了。又有一位和他在一个地区工作过的同志告诉我说，他外出开会，不管路有多远，总是步行。有一次开完会已是中午时分，他仍冒着暑热，忍着饥饿，从十多里远的地方走回家去。他爱人问他为什么不到饭铺里吃点东西再坐上公共汽车回来，他说，走回来是既省钱，又方便。
    岁暮天寒，我想起“岁寒然后知冬柏之后雕”的古话，我深深地为这位我们敬爱的老师祝福！
