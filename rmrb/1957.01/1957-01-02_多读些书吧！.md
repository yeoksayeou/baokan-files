    Read More Books!
    Gao Gejin
    Ah, how I wish I had the talent to read all the books in this library in a single day.
    Ah, how I wish I had a tremendous memory, so that I would never forget everything I have read throughout my life.
    Ah, how I wish I had the wealth to buy all these books for myself.
    Ah, how I wish I had such great wisdom, to convey everything written in the books to others.
    Ah, how I wish I could become so clever, so that I could write the same kind of works...
    This is a poem written by Dobrolyubov in his youth. In this poem, he expressed his strong interest in and urgent need for reading. This fervent desire was also fully embodied in his actual actions. In 1849 alone, when he was only thirteen years old, he read 410 books, averaging more than one or two books a day.
    How amazing and worthy of emulation this is! It was this Dobrolyubov who, in the short four years between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-five before his death, wrote more than a hundred rich and profound essays, highly combative and artistic, which were praised in unison by Marx and Engels, who were not easily given to praise. The remarkable achievements of this great Russian revolutionary democrat and literary critic were by no means accidental. His situation seems to confirm the two famous lines of Du Fu's poem: "Read ten thousand volumes, and write as if with divine help!"
    However, many of our comrades today severely lack interest in and the habit of reading. Recently, a reporter saw some phenomena below that are worth paying attention to: some county party secretaries, in a year, aside from reading party documents, only browsed a few comic books. Many cadres of the Communist Youth League also read very little, so that when contacting and talking with young people, they can only stay on a few abstract preachings. Not long ago, I also heard someone say that a college student said "Journey to the West" was a foreign work, and a young man who translated for a Soviet expert translated the idiom "胸有成竹" (xiōng yǒu chéng zhú, having a well-thought-out plan) into "there is a bamboo stick in the belly," and a drama actor wrote Gao Erji (Gorky) as a Chinese person when answering questions in a written test. When he walked out of the examination room, he smugly said to others: "I didn't know Erji was a Chinese, and I didn't even know his last name was Gao." This phenomenon of not loving to read and being poor in knowledge is so disproportionate to our country's cultural backwardness and the objective requirement to strive to advance towards science and culture and catch up with the world's advanced cultural level in a short period of time! Therefore, I feel that today, it is particularly necessary to advocate that everyone read, so that it becomes a good social atmosphere. Let people spend more of their leisure time on "learning, learning, and learning again," and not spend too much thought on eating, drinking, and having fun. Gorky believed that everything good he had was given to him by books. Every good book opens a window in front of people to understand the complex and ever-changing world, helping people to better transform the world. The true communist in Lenin's eyes is by no means a poor wretch who can only recite a few principles of communism, but someone who can critically absorb all the excellent cultural heritage of mankind. Mr. Lu Xun was proficient in many aspects of knowledge, both Chinese and foreign, ancient and modern, and was able to combine his own national characteristics to add many valuable and unique creations to our country's culture and art.
    Gogol ridiculed Petrushka-style reading in "Dead Souls." Although he had "the noble ambition of being studious," he had no practical gains at all. "He was reading desperately, although he didn't understand what the content was: whether it was 'Love Hero Adventure,' a primary school textbook, or a prayer book, he treated them all the same—he read them all very vigorously; if he were given a chemistry textbook—he probably wouldn't refuse it either. What pleased him wasn't what he was reading, but that he was reading, or perhaps rather, that he was reading on and on, that the letters could spell out words, which was very interesting, but the meaning of the words, he didn't understand and didn't care to." Petrushka wasted his life reading ten thousand volumes; this is of course not to be followed. Our proposition is to selectively, critically, extensively, and deeply hunt for knowledge from books, and to connect this knowledge with practical life for investigation and flexible application.

    多读些书吧！
    高歌今
    啊，我是多么希望拥有这样的才能，在一天之中把这个图书馆里的书都读光。
    啊，我是多么希望具有巨大的记忆力，要使一切我所读过的东西，终生都不遗忘。
    啊，我是多么希望拥有这样的财富，能够替自己买下这所有的书籍。
    啊，我是多么希望赋有这样巨大的智慧，要把书本中所写的一切东西都传达给别人。
    啊，我多么希望自己也能变成这样聪明，使我也能够写出同样的作品……
    这是杜勃罗留波夫少年时代所写的一首诗。他在这首诗中表示了他对读书的浓厚兴趣和迫切需要。这种热烈的愿望也充分体现在他的实际行动中。单是1849这一年，他才十三岁的时候，就读了四百一十种书，平均每天总在一两本以上。
    这是多么令人惊讶和值得仿效的事情啊！正是这个杜勃罗留波夫，才能在二十一岁到二十五岁逝世前这短短的四年中间，写下一百多篇内容丰富而又深刻，具有高度的战斗性和艺术性的辉煌论文，受到很不容易夸奖别人的马克思和恩格斯的同声称赞。这个伟大的俄国革命民主主义者和文艺批评家的卓越成就，决不是偶然的。他的情况真好似证实了杜甫的两句名诗：“读书破万卷，下笔如有神”！
    然而我们今天有不少的同志却十分缺乏读书的兴趣和习惯。最近有个记者在下面看到一些现象是值得重视的：有的县委书记一年除了看党的文件外，就只翻阅了几本连环画。不少青年团的干部也很少读书，以致在和青年接触和交谈的时候，只能停留在几句抽象的说教上。就在不久以前，我还听人说起有个大学生说“西游记”是外国作品，有位为苏联专家翻译的青年把“胸有成竹”这句成语译成“肚子里头有根竹棍子”，有个话剧演员在笔试时回答问题把高尔基写成中国人。他走出考场时还自以为是地对别人说：“尔基不姓高，吾尚不知其为中国人也。”这种不爱读书，知识贫乏的现象，和我国文化落后，急需努力向科学文化进军，在短期内赶上世界先进文化水平的客观要求是多么不相称啊！因此，我觉得在今天，特别需要提倡大家读书，使之成为一种良好的社会风气。让人们把闲暇的时间多用在“学习学习再学习”上，不要在吃喝玩乐上花费过多的心思。高尔基认为他的一切好的东西，都是书给他的。每一本好书都在人们面前打开了一扇认识复杂多变的世界的窗子，有助于人们更好地改造世界。列宁眼中的真正共产主义者，决不是那些只会背诵几条共产主义的原理原则的可怜虫，而是能够批判地吸收人类一切优秀文化遗产的人。鲁迅先生就是精通中外古今许多方面的知识，而又能够结合自己的民族特点，给我国文化艺术增添了很多宝贵的独特创造的。
    果戈里在“死魂灵”中嘲笑了彼得尔希加式的读书。他虽有“好学的高尚的志向”，但是一点实际收获也没有。“他在拼命的读书，虽然并不懂得内容是怎样：‘情爱英雄冒险记’也好，小学的初等读本或是祷告书也好，他完全一视同仁——都一样的读得很起劲；如果给他一本化学教科书，——大约也不会不要的。他所高兴的并非他在读什么，高兴的是在读书，也许不如说，是在读下去，字母会拼出字来，有趣得很，可是这字的意义，却不懂也不要紧。”彼得尔希加读书万卷，只是在浪费生命，这当然也是不足为训的。我们的主张是有选择、有批判、广泛而又深入地向书本猎取知识，并把这些知识和实际生活联系起来加以考察，灵活运用。
