Learning from the Excellent Construction Experience of the People
Lanzhou Waterworks Boldly Modifies the Original Design of the Intake Project, Using Folk Construction Experience to Shorten the Construction Period and Save Investment.
Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, January 4th: The two intakes of the Lanzhou Waterworks' water intake system are expected to have their construction time shortened by two-thirds and save more than one million yuan in investment because they adopted the folk's inherent method of building dams by mixing grass and soil for floating and sinking.
The water for the Lanzhou Waterworks is taken directly from the Yellow River. The original design of the intake project for the water entering the bucket-type pre-sedimentation tank required underwater construction in the Yellow River with a flow rate of 2.7 meters per second. This would have required 40 divers proficient in underwater blasting techniques, dozens of flat-bottomed iron boats, powered boats, and barges, as well as other steel and various equipment suitable for underwater construction, taking six months to complete. However, Lanzhou did not have this technology and equipment, and the construction time could not be delayed any further. After repeated studies by relevant provincial and municipal authorities, it was decided to use the folk method of building dams by mixing grass and soil, that is, to build a grass-and-soil cofferdam in the Yellow River at the intake, then pump the water out of the cofferdam and carry out land blasting construction.
The sixteen technicians who participated in the cofferdam construction project had been building grass-and-soil dams in the Qin Canal, Han Canal, and Tanglai Canal in northern Gansu for thirty or forty years. There were also 180 migrant workers who had built dams and more than 200 migrant workers from other places. They built two grass-and-soil cofferdams at the upstream and downstream intakes in just forty days. Now the upstream intake project has been completed, and the Yellow River water in the downstream intake cofferdam has been pumped out. Workers are carrying out rock blasting in the waterless cofferdam and will be completed soon. Judging from the current construction progress, it can be shortened by four months compared to the original plan. (Attached picture)

    学习民间的优良建设经验
    兰州自来水厂大胆修改进水口工程原来的设计，利用民间施工经验进行建设，缩短了工期，节省了投资。
    据新华社兰州4日电　兰州自来水厂取水系统的两个进水口，因为采用了民间固有的草土混合漂浮下沉筑坝法，使进水口施工时间预计可以缩短三分之二，并且可以节省投资一百多万元。
    兰州自来水厂的水直接取自黄河。河水进到斗槽式预沉池的进水口工程，原设计要在流速每秒二点七公尺的黄河水下施工，需要掌握水下爆破技术的潜水员四十人，平底铁船、动力船和驳船等几十只，以及其他钢材和适应水下施工的各种设备，需要六个月才能完工。但是兰州没有这些技术设备，施工的时间也不允许再拖延。经过省、市有关机关的多次研究，决定用民间的草土混合筑坝方法，即在进水口处的黄河里筑一道草土围堰，然后把围堰里的水抽干，进行陆地爆破施工。
    参加筑围堰工程的十六名技术员曾经在甘肃北部秦渠、汉渠和唐徕渠筑草土坝三、四十年，还有筑过坝的一百八十名民工和其他各地来的二百多名民工。他们在上下游两个进水口处，只用四十天的功夫就筑起了两个草土围堰。现在上游的进水口工程已经完工，下游的进水口围堰中的黄河水已经被抽干，工人们正在没有水的围堰内进行石方爆破，不久就可以完工。从现在的施工进度来看，可以比原计划缩短四个月。（附图片）
