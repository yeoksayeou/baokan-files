Welcoming the World Youth Festival

More Than Six Million Commemorative Medals

From July 28th to August 11th this year, the Sixth World Festival of Youth and Students will be held in Moscow. Some factories of the State Currency Issuance Administration of the Ministry of Finance of the Soviet Union are working hard to produce more than six million commemorative medals for the festival. One type is the festival badge, which looks like a small flower. Its center is a blue earth, inlaid with the gold words: "For Peace and Friendship." The circle outside the earth says, "Sixth World Festival of Youth and Students. Moscow, 1957." Further outside are five small petals of red, brown, orange-yellow, green, and yellow, symbolizing the world's five continents. Every participant of the festival will wear this badge.

Ninety Special Trains

Thirty thousand young people from various countries and one hundred and twenty-five thousand young people from various republics, border regions, and states of the Soviet Union will participate in the festival. In order to ensure that so many guests can smoothly go to Moscow to participate in the festival, the Soviet Passenger Transportation Administration plans to use ninety trains composed of all-metal carriages for transportation. Serving on these trains are the best crew teams composed of young people. They will study for two weeks in training classes to become familiar with the various programs of the festival, the economic and living conditions of the countries participating in the festival, and to learn some foreign languages necessary for serving foreign guests. These special trains will start from the Soviet border stations of Choch, Brest, Odessa, Otpor, Leningrad, Tashkent, Murmansk, etc., and end at the six major stations in Moscow. Temporary dormitories will be prepared for the guests at the terminal stations, and return tickets will be sold.

More Than 170,000 Tourist Guides

To facilitate the participants of the festival to visit Moscow, the Soviet Foreign Languages Publishing House has published 175,000 tourist guides in German, French, Spanish, Swedish, and many other languages. With such a tourist guide in hand, guests can visit the Moscow Metro, the All-Union Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition, the Tretyakov Gallery, and some museums and parks in Moscow without a guide. In addition, conversation manuals in Russian, English, French, German, Spanish, and Italian will also be published.

Raising More Pigeons

In order to have more pigeons—symbols of peace and friendship—flying over the Lenin Stadium (where the festival will be held) on the opening day of the festival, the youth and students of the Soviet Union have organized pigeon-breeding enthusiast clubs in many cities and villages since last year to raise more pigeons. Moscow's pigeon-breeding enthusiasts have decided to release 30,000 white pigeons on the opening day of the festival. The youth of Kiev have also decided to bring at least 3,000 pigeons to the festival. Participants from other parts of the Soviet Union will also bring many pigeons.

More Than 12,000 Sales Outlets

To facilitate the participants of the festival to purchase souvenirs and various items, the Soviet Ministry of Trade plans to set up more than 12,000 souvenir stalls, carts, and kiosks on various streets in Moscow during the festival. Some major department stores in Moscow will also set up many sales outlets made of special metal that can be easily disassembled and installed. (Zhang) (With picture)

    迎接世界青年联欢节
    六百多万枚纪念章
    今年7月28日到8月11日在莫斯科将举行第六届世界青年与学生联欢节，苏联财政部国家货币发行管理局的一些工厂，正在加紧赶制六百多万枚联欢节的纪念章，其中有一种是联欢节的徽章，很像一朵小花。它的中心是一个蓝色的地球，上面嵌着金字：“争取和平和友谊”，地球外面的圆圈上写着“第六届世界青年与学生联欢节。莫斯科，1957年”。再外面是五个红色、棕色、橙黄色、绿色和黄色的小花瓣，这象征着世界五大洲。联欢节的每一个参加者都要戴这个徽章。
    九十列专车
    世界各国的三万名青年和苏联各共和国、边疆区和州的十二万五千名青年将参加联欢节。苏联客运管理局为了使这么多客人顺利地到莫斯科去参加联欢节，准备用九十列由全金属车厢组成的客车来载运。在这些列车上服务的是由青年组成的最好的乘务组。他们将要在学习班里学习两个星期，以熟悉联欢节的各种节目、参加联欢节的各个国家的经济和人民生活情况，并且要学习为外国客人服务所必需的一些外国语。这些专车将以苏联国境乔奇、布列斯特、敖德萨、奥特波尔、列宁格勒、塔什干、摩尔曼斯克等车站为起点，以莫斯科的六个大车站为终点。在终点车站上为客人们准备好临时宿舍，并且出售回程的车票。
    十七万多本游览指南
    为了便利联欢节的参加者游览莫斯科，苏联外国文书籍出版局用德文、法文、西班牙文、瑞典文和许多别的文字出版了十七万五千本游览指南。客人们拿着这样一本游览指南，就可以不用向导来参观莫斯科地下铁道、全苏工业和农业展览会、特列季亚科夫画廊以及莫斯科的一些博物馆和公园。此外，还要出版俄文、英文、法文、德文、西班牙文和意大利文的会话手册。
    饲养更多的鸽子
    苏联的青年和学生为了在联欢节开幕的那一天有更多的鸽子——和平和友谊的象征——在列宁体育场（联欢节将在这里举行）的上空飞翔。从去年起，许多城乡的青年和学生就组织起养鸽爱好者俱乐部，饲养更多的鸽子。莫斯科的养鸽爱好者决定在联欢节开幕这天放出三万只白鸽子。基辅的青年也决定最少要带三千只鸽子到联欢节去，苏联其他各地的联欢节参加者也要带许多鸽子去。
    一万二千多个售货处
    苏联贸易部为了便利联欢节参加者购买纪念品和各种物品，准备在联欢节期间在莫斯科各个大街上设立一万二千多个出售纪念品的售货摊、手推车和商亭。莫斯科的一些主要百货商店也要设立许多用特种金属制造的、可以随时拆卸和安装起来的售货处。　（章）（附图片）
