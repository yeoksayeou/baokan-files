Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, 26th. Iranian Prime Minister Hossein Ala denied on the 25th that an American atomic base would be established in Iran. He told reporters at the airport upon returning to Tehran after attending the Baghdad Pact's four Muslim countries conference in Ankara: "I can assure you that we did not discuss this issue at all in Ankara."

Ala made the above statement after the Soviet Union issued a warning regarding the American plan to establish and station atomic forces in countries such as Iran.

Iranian Foreign Minister Ardalan, who accompanied Ala to the Ankara conference, said: There is no indication that Britain intends to withdraw from the Baghdad Pact. He said, "Our alliance is increasingly strong."

    伊朗首相保证不建美国原子基地
    新华社26日讯　德黑兰消息：伊朗首相侯赛尼·阿拉25日否认将在伊朗建立美国原子基地。他在安卡拉参加了巴格达条约四个穆斯林国家会议后回到德黑兰时在机场对新闻记者说：“我可以向你们保证，我们在安卡拉一点没有谈过这个问题。”
    阿拉是在苏联方面就美国计划在伊朗等国家建立和驻扎原子部队发出警告后作上述表示的。
    陪同阿拉出席安卡拉会议回来的伊朗外交大臣阿达兰说：没有迹象表明英国要退出巴格达条约。他说：“我们的联盟日益坚固”。
