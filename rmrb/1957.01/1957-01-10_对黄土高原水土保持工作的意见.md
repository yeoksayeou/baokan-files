    Opinions on Soil and Water Conservation in the Loess Plateau
    Luo Laixing
    Soil and water conservation in the Loess Plateau is one of the key measures to fundamentally control the Yellow River's water disasters and develop the Yellow River's water resources. It is directly related to the production development and people's lives in relevant areas of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. The state has invested and will continue to invest a large amount of funds to carry out this work. From 1953 to now, I have continuously participated in soil and water conservation investigation and research in the Loess Plateau. Regarding some of the more significant problems existing in this work over the past few years, I have some immature views that I would like to discuss.
    The Basic Causes of Soil and Water Loss
    The severity of soil and water loss in the Loess Plateau is rare in other parts of the world. Not only is the amount of loss large, but the area involved is also very wide. Soil and water loss refers to the loss of water and soil caused by external forces, especially hydraulic power, damaging the composition of the ground, that is, the erosion of soil-like deposits. Before human economic activities began, the process of erosion belonged to the category of natural erosion. Natural erosion is caused by various natural factors. During the erosion process, some natural factors promote the development of erosion, while others prevent it. Because natural factors have mutual constraints, the progress of natural erosion is generally very slow. However, after human economic activities began, especially after the rise of agriculture, unreasonable land use led to "accelerated erosion." As time goes on, the original natural factors that prevented erosion are damaged by human forces, gradually to the point of completely losing their function. The original natural factors that promoted erosion exert their effect, becoming more and more intense, causing rapid and massive soil and water loss, bringing great harm to the national economy.
    The current erosion in the Loess Plateau, its speed and quantity, is extremely alarming. This is the result of the unreasonable land use under the feudal system in China for thousands of years. At present, although agricultural production has begun to be collectivized, the production and management methods in most areas still maintain the past simple agricultural production, or even simple grain crop production. Some natural conditions in the Loess Plateau are poor, especially the continuous and severe soil and water loss. Simple agricultural production not only results in lower crop yields than in other areas, but also in unstable yields due to various natural disasters. At the same time, these areas have long lacked fuel, fodder, and fertilizer, so that it is still impossible to stop the masses from indiscriminately reclaiming, grazing, and felling. If the basic causes of this erosion are not eliminated, soil and water loss will continue to exist and develop even more severely.
    Considering the natural conditions and soil and water loss situation in the Loess Plateau, we should gradually change the current simple agricultural production and carry out diversified production combining agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry to make reasonable use of the land. The Loess Plateau is vast, and the natural and economic conditions vary from region to region. The proportion of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry and their development paths will naturally differ. This is the reason for carrying out the land rational utilization zoning work that will be mentioned below. In the process of gradually changing production and management methods, we should take care of grain production and retain farmland under the principle of not causing soil and water loss. On land where there are conditions for rapid production increase, we should adopt all relevant agricultural and water conservancy measures to continuously improve the yield of crops per unit area. However, on land where soil and water loss cannot be controlled by taking all soil and water conservation measures, we should not continue farming, otherwise we will still be taking the old road of "extensive planting with low yields." It should be affirmed that rational land use is the most fundamental way to eliminate the causes of soil and water loss. Under the small-scale peasant economy of feudal society, it was impossible to achieve rational land use. But today, on the basis of agricultural collectivization, it is possible to rationally use the land.
    The Guiding Principles for Carrying Out Soil and Water Conservation Work
    Soil and water loss always occurs when rainwater falls on the ground, carrying away the soil, causing water and soil to be transported from top to bottom, from the slope (including slopes between gullies and valley slopes) to the gully bed. Water flow is the driving force, and soil-like deposits are the object of erosion. Different types of land (different slope shapes, gradients, lengths, and different utilization in production, etc.) are subject to different types and degrees of erosion. Therefore, different soil and water conservation measures should be taken for different types of land in order to prevent soil and water loss and benefit production.
    At present, there are already many advanced agricultural production cooperatives with a good foundation that have adopted a variety of soil and water conservation measures according to land conditions. Unfortunately, in most counties in the relevant areas, soil and water conservation work is not tailored to local conditions to comprehensively arrange various soil and water conservation measures in the same area. What can be seen is that some places are full of terraces, some places are full of field ridges, some slopes are only afforested, and some gullies are only dammed. It is difficult to achieve results by using single soil and water conservation measures to fight against various soil and water loss phenomena.
    Many counties in Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu have universally built earth dams in gullies. These earth dams are divided into two categories: one is large and medium-sized dams, planned to intercept mud, store floodwater, and use reservoir water for irrigation or even power generation; the other is small dams, specially used for siltation for agricultural production. However, almost no other soil and water conservation measures are taken on the valley slopes above the earth dams and the ridge slopes and mound slopes of the land between the gullies. The number of earth dams built in these areas in the first half of 1956 was the largest. Building earth dams is labor-intensive and expensive. The earth dam in Qishilipu, Guanzi Township, Tianshui County, Gansu Province, with a height of 19 meters, used a total of 34,300 workdays. The earth dam in Anjiapu Gully, Dingxi County, invested about 40,000 workdays and more than 40,000 yuan in funds. The earth dam in Anjiagou, Huining County, invested 200,000 workdays. Due to the large amount of labor and funds invested in earth dams, other soil and water conservation measures on the valley slopes and ridge and mound slopes above the earth dams are rarely carried out. Some people think that carrying out multiple soil and water conservation work will create a contradiction of insufficient labor, which is actually a question of how to rationally allocate and use labor. If a large amount of labor is only used for dam construction, of course, there will be no power to carry out other soil and water conservation work.
    It should be pointed out that the situation of earth dams being washed away by floods is very serious. According to incomplete data, Shanxi Province had a total of more than 3,500 gully dikes and more than 1,000 dams washed away during the 1956 flood season; in the summer of 1956, 1,600 dams in Gansu were washed away. In Qingyang County, Gansu, of the 36 dams built in the spring of 1956, only one remained intact by the end of July of the same year. The report "Soil and Water Loss and the Effect of Soil and Water Conservation Measures in the Rainstorm of Jiuyuan Gully and Xindian Gully in Northern Shaanxi on August 8, 1956," compiled by the Northwest Yellow River Engineering Bureau, mentioned that there were a total of 84 small earth dams in the entire Jiuyuan Gully watershed. Before 1956, 14 of them had been silted up by sediment. On August 8, 1956, the area encountered a rainstorm that lasted a total of 275 minutes, with an average rainfall of 40.7 mm. As a result, 48 earth dams were silted up by sediment, 11 were partially washed away by floods, and 7 were completely washed away. If we calculate the investment and labor of all the earth dams that have been washed away in Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces over the past few years, the loss is astonishing! Some people believe that the earth dams in the Jiuyuan Gully watershed were washed away by floods and silted up by sediment because they encountered a rainstorm that was rare in a century. It should be explained that there is currently no scientific method to calculate the frequency of rainstorms in monsoon climate zones, especially the larger rainstorms in the Loess Plateau, which can occur once every few decades or even hundreds of years, or once every few years, or even continuously within a few years. Some people also believe that the destruction of earth dams is due to the lack of thorough site selection, correct dam design, and quality inspection of the project. Although these are also some of the reasons, the more important reason is that without other soil and water conservation measures in the vast catchment area above the dam, it is impossible to alleviate and reduce the speed and amount of surface runoff and the amount of sediment.
    At the same time, the situation of earth dams being silted up by sediment is also very terrible. The Jiuyuan Gully large dam built in Suide County, Shaanxi in 1953, with a dam height of 20 meters, had a sediment accumulation of 10 meters thick upstream of the dam in 1954 alone. After the flood on August 8, 1956, it had been completely silted up, and the top of the dam has now been raised by 4 meters. Undoubtedly, a large amount of sediment mainly comes from the slopes between gullies and the valley slopes of the gullies. If the erosion of the slopes is not controlled, the reservoir will soon be silted to death.
    Some people think that the purpose of building small earth dams is to hope for rapid siltation, because the crop yield on the silted land is very high. This method of "moving" the soil and fertilizer from the slope to the bottom of the gully in order to increase the crop yield on a small area of silted land and reduce the crop yield on a large area of slope farmland is not in line with the principles of soil and water conservation. The habit of building dams for siltation by the masses in northern Shaanxi is a product of the past small-scale peasant economy.
    Some people believe that building large earth dams can reduce gully bottom erosion, intercept floods and sediment, and use reservoir water for fish farming, irrigation, power generation, etc. It is undeniable that large earth dams have these effects, but they can only be realized under the conditions that the earth dam is not washed away by floods and is not silted up by sediment. Among the existing large dams in the Loess Plateau, how many have used reservoir water for fish farming, how many can generate electricity, how many can irrigate, how many fish have been raised, how much electricity has been generated, how much farmland has actually been irrigated, etc.? If we investigate, the situation is difficult to satisfy.
    Any type of earth dam has only two solutions after being silted up by sediment: one is to continue raising the top of the dam, and if it is silted up again, it can only be raised again; the other is to build earth dams upstream of it, and if the newly built earth dams are silted up again, new earth dams can only be built upstream of it. In October 1956, when I accompanied Professor Armand of the Soviet Academy of Sciences to Gansu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces for inspection, he also asked with suspicion, how long and where will this continue? Further, if the silted earth dam does not take the above two methods, then a step-by-step terraced land will be formed at the bottom of the gully, and after the flood overflows, it will definitely continue to be eroded. This is not a theoretical speculation, and there is already evidence of the fact. According to the statistics of the Jiuyuan Gully Soil and Water Conservation Station, in the flood on August 8, 1956, of the 18 siltation dams, the original sediment in the dams was partially washed away by the flood in 11 dams, totaling 14,667 cubic meters, and completely washed away by the flood in 7 dams, totaling 28,000 cubic meters. At the same time, the dam body was also damaged or washed away. In this way, even the flood interception, sediment interception, and gully bottom erosion prevention functions of the earth dam are lost.
    Some people believe that in order to reduce the sediment accumulation in the Sanmenxia Reservoir, which is about to be built, we must quickly build dams in the gullies of the Loess Plateau. But unfortunately, before the Sanmenxia Reservoir was built, a large number of earth dams built in the Loess Plateau before 1956 were either washed away, silted up, or had their reservoir capacity reduced by siltation, and would soon lose their sediment interception effect. If we want to make an overall plan, we should vigorously carry out slope management of the catchment area of the gullies before the Sanmenxia Reservoir is filled with water, reduce sediment loss, and then build a large number of dams in the gullies one or two years before the Sanmenxia Reservoir is about to be filled with water. Wouldn't it be more effective in intercepting sediment? Also, when a rainstorm comes in the gullies adjacent to the main stream of the Yellow River, sediment directly flows into the Yellow River, while in the gullies far away from the main stream of the Yellow River, the sediment carried by the flood will accumulate along the river valleys of the tributaries or tributaries of the tributaries of the Yellow River. Although it will still be input into the Yellow River in the end, it is far less rapid in time than the gullies adjacent to the main stream of the Yellow River. Is there no urgency in the region for building dams in the gullies?
    Some people also believe that biological measures are permanent for preventing soil and water loss, but they are too slow, and engineering measures are temporary, but they are very fast. The term "biological measures" is not very clear, and generally refers to forest soil and water conservation measures. Engineering soil and water conservation measures do not only refer to building dams at the bottom of the gully, but also slope engineering, such as building terraces, building ridges, and digging horizontal ditches. It is wrong to view biological measures and engineering measures as opposites. Any soil and water conservation measure has a certain effect, and building dams at the bottom of the gully should not be an exception. However, emphasizing a certain measure will not only fail to succeed, but also suffer failure. For example, even on slopes suitable for building terraces in the land between gullies, if the terrace surface does not take water eddies, horizontal plowing ditches, and other soil and water conservation farming methods, and if ridges are not built on the edges of the terraces, and shrubs are not planted on the slopes of the ridges, the terraces will be washed away by water. Even on barren slopes in gullies suitable for afforestation, saplings will be difficult to plant if horizontal ditches or horizontal steps (slope engineering) are not used for afforestation. Even if various measures have been taken on the valley slopes of the gullies, the valley slopes will not achieve the desired erosion prevention effect if they are not combined with various measures on the slopes of the land between the gullies. Even if the bottom of the gully is suitable for dam construction, the earth dam will be washed away by floods or silted up by sediment if it is not combined with various treatments on the valley slopes and the slopes of the land between the gullies.
    This is not a complete negation of the soil and water conservation effect of building dams at the bottom of the gully, because it is one of the comprehensive measures for soil and water conservation. What is opposed is the policy of simply building dams as soil and water conservation work, regardless of region, time, or conditions.
    I believe that the guiding principle of soil and water conservation work must be to combat soil and water loss phenomena comprehensively under the principle of rational land use, through production cooperative organizations, mobilizing the broad masses of the people, and taking comprehensive measures of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, water conservancy, field engineering, and gully engineering (including building earth dams and gully dikes at the bottom of the gully, etc.). Various soil and water conservation measures must be taken from top to bottom, taking care of both the slope and the gully, and step by step conserving and intercepting water and soil. The practice of only taking care of the tail and not the head, and only taking care of the bottom and not the top is wrong. The various soil and water conservation measures themselves must be fully coordinated. The practice of only valuing any one measure and ignoring other measures is wrong.
    How to Carry Out Soil and Water Conservation Work
    Soil and water conservation in the Loess Plateau is a vast and complex task, and the task is very arduous. However, on the basis of agricultural collectivization in China today, there are both conditions for rational land use and conditions for taking comprehensive measures for soil and water conservation. I think it is urgent to solve the following problems.
    First, carry out zoning work for soil and water conservation and rational land use in large areas. The direction of production development in the Loess Plateau should be the organic coordination of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry production departments. This is the only way to take the policy of soil and water conservation work with comprehensive measures of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, water conservancy, field engineering, and gully engineering. However, the vast Loess Plateau has different natural (climate, geology, geomorphology, hydrology, soil, vegetation, etc.) and economic (population density, labor force, economic development history, economic status, and production problems, etc.) conditions in each region. The degree of soil and water loss and its impact on the Sanmenxia Reservoir also vary. The combination of land types that are currently or have not been utilized in each region is even more different on the ground. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out zoning work for soil and water conservation and rational land use. This is an arduous scientific task. The Comprehensive Investigation Team for Soil and Water Conservation in the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has done this work in Jinxi, northern Shaanxi, and central Gansu from 1955 to 1956, and they have gained a lot of experience. However, this zoning must be in line with the national economic plan, and it also needs to be discussed in detail with the agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production departments before it can be formulated.
    Second, carry out planning work for soil and water conservation and rational land use in small gully watersheds. Select representative small gully watersheds with an area of 10 to 15 square kilometers in each zoning area of the above-mentioned zoning (some can use the existing ones selected by the soil and water conservation stations), so that the scope of the agricultural production cooperative's land is in line with the boundaries of the small gully watershed, and set up soil and water conservation stations in it to make a plan for soil and water conservation and rational land use in a typical small area. According to the labor conditions of the agricultural production cooperatives in the small gully watershed, complete this long-term plan within a relatively short period of time. Within this time limit, make phased implementation plans and instructions, especially within the first phase of the time limit, make annual implementation plan maps and instructions. All implementation plans must be unified in time and on the ground, but must not violate two principles: one is that various soil and water conservation measures are carried out from top to bottom, from the watershed of the land between the gullies to the slope, from the valley slope of the gully to the bottom of the gully. If there is a shortage of labor, do not build dams at the bottom of the gully first unless special circumstances are encountered; the other is the mutual combination of various soil and water conservation measures, especially the combination of engineering measures and forestry measures. The soil and water conservation stations in the typical small gully watershed should compile a soil and water conservation manual as soon as possible and distribute it to the relevant agricultural production cooperatives. The soil and water conservation stations should also carry out various relevant experiments and studies, especially the observation and testing of the effectiveness of various soil and water conservation measures, and constantly revise the implementation specifications of various soil and water conservation measures in the manual. It will not be successful to formulate a specification for any soil and water conservation measure to be applied throughout the Loess Plateau. This planning work also includes arduous scientific work. The Comprehensive Investigation Team for Soil and Water Conservation in the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River of the Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted this planning in Lishan and Xingxian in Shanxi and Dingxi and Huining counties in Gansu from 1955 to 1956, and gained some experience. However, this planning must be in line with the production conditions of the cooperatives, and still needs to be discussed and agreed upon by the local production leaders, soil and water conservation station staff, and agricultural production cooperative members before it can be formulated and implemented.
    Third, improve organizational structure and strengthen leadership. For several years, soil and water conservation work in the Loess Plateau has been led by the water conservancy department, whether at the central or local level. It can be seen that the guiding principles and steps of this work are to only value water conservancy engineering measures and ignore other measures, and only manage the bottom of the gully and not the slope. Naturally, the water conservancy department should carry out water conservancy engineering measures. The work belonging to the agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production departments cannot all be done by the water conservancy department. It is unfair to blame the water conservancy department in this regard.
    Soil and water conservation is a comprehensive work. The agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy departments should form a unified joint front and cannot fight alone. It is recommended that a special soil and water conservation agency be established by the State Council above the above-mentioned departments to coordinate leadership and directly assign soil and water conservation work tasks and funds to the localities. Provinces, special zones, and counties should also establish special soil and water conservation agencies to promote soil and water conservation work to the countryside. Soil and water conservation is a mass work. It is closely linked to various productions, and the masses will not fail to accept it. Soil and water conservation stations have the responsibility to conduct publicity and education to the masses, so that soil and water conservation knowledge is widely disseminated.

    对黄土高原水土保持工作的意见
    罗来兴
    黄土高原的水土保持工作，是根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的关键性措施之一，它直接关系到山西、陕西、甘肃三省有关地区的生产发展和人民生活。国家已经并且将要继续投入大量的资金，开展这一项工作。从1953年到现在，笔者连续参加黄土高原的水土保持调查研究工作，对于几年来在这项工作中所存在的一些比较重大的问题，有一些不成熟的看法，想提出来谈谈。
    水土流失的基本原因
    黄土高原水土流失的严重情况是世界上其他地区所少见的，不仅流失量很大，而且涉及面积很广。水土流失，就是指地面以外来的力量，特别是水力，破坏地面的组成物质所造成的水和土的流失，也就是土状堆积物的侵蚀。侵蚀发生的过程，在人类开始经济活动以前，属于自然侵蚀的范畴。自然侵蚀是由于各种自然因素所促成的，在侵蚀进行的过程中，某些自然因素促进侵蚀作用的发展，但是某些自然因素又防止侵蚀作用的发展。由于自然因素之间起着相互制约作用，所以自然侵蚀的进行一般是很缓慢的。但是在人类开始经济活动以后，特别是农业兴起以后，对土地的利用不合理，就会发生“加速侵蚀”。随着时间的推进，原来那些防止侵蚀的自然因素，受到人为力量的破坏，逐渐以至完全丧失它们的作用，原来那些促进侵蚀的自然因素，发挥它们的作用，愈演愈剧烈，造成急速的大量的水土流失，给国民经济带来很大的危害。
    现阶段黄土高原的侵蚀，它的速度和数量都极为惊人，这是我国几千年来封建制度下的不合理地利用土地的结果。目前，农业生产虽然已经开始合作化，但是生产经营方式，绝大多数地区还保持过去的单纯农业生产，甚至单纯粮食作物生产。黄土高原的某几项自然条件不好，特别是水土连续而严重的流失，单纯的农业生产，不只农作物的产量比其他地区低，而且由于多种的自然灾害，产量极不稳定。同时这些地区由于长期缺乏燃料、饲料和肥料，以致目前还无法停止群众滥垦、滥牧和滥伐的行为。如果产生这种侵蚀的基本原因不消除，水土流失将会继续存在并且将发展得更为严重。
    考虑到黄土高原的自然条件和水土流失情况，应该逐步改变现阶段的单纯农业生产，进行农、林、牧结合的多种生产，使土地得到合理利用。黄土高原面积辽阔，各地区的自然条件和经济条件的不同，农、林、牧各种生产的配置比重和它们的发展途径，自然会有差别，这就是下面将要提到的要进行土地合理利用的区划工作的理由。在逐步改变生产经营方式的过程中，应该照顾粮食生产，在不招致水土流失的原则下，保留农耕地。在有条件迅速增产的土地上，采用一切有关农业和水利的措施，使单位面积的农作物产量不断提高。但是在采取一切保持水土措施还无法控制水土流失的土地上，不应该继续农耕，否则就是仍然走过去的“广种薄收”的道路。应该肯定，对土地的合理利用才是最基本的消除水土流失原因的办法。在封建社会的小农经济制度之下，是不可能做到土地的合理利用的。可是在今天农业合作化的基础上，合理地利用土地已经是可能的了。
    开展水土保持工作的方针
    水土流失的进行，总是雨水落在地面，带动地面的土，使水和土从上而下、由坡面（包括沟间地坡面和沟谷谷坡）输送到沟床。水流是动力，土状堆积物是被侵蚀的对象。不同类型的土地（不同的坡形、坡度、坡长和生产上的不同的利用等因素）受到不同方式和不同程度的侵蚀。所以对不同类型的土地，应该采取不同的水土保持措施，才能防止水土流失而又有利于生产。
    目前已经有不少基础比较好的高级农业生产合作社，根据土地情况，采取了多种的水土保持措施。遗憾的是有关地区绝大多数县的水土保持工作，不是因地制宜，把多种水土保持措施在同一地域上来全面布置的。可以看到，总是某地全是梯田，某地全是地边埂，某些坡面又只是造林，某些沟谷只是修坝。这样采用单一的水土保持措施，要来同多种多样的水土流失现象作斗争，是很难收效的。
    山西、陕西、甘肃的许多县普遍在沟谷中修了土坝。这些土坝分两类，一类是大、中型的坝，计划可以拦泥、蓄洪，并利用库水来灌溉甚或发电的；另一类是小型的坝，专门用于淤地来从事农业生产的。而对土坝以上的沟谷的谷坡和沟间地的梁坡、峁（音卯，小山的圆顶）坡，几乎不采取任何其他保持水土的措施。1956年上半年这些地区所修的土坝数量最大。修土坝是费工而又费钱的。甘肃省天水县关子乡七十里铺的土坝，坝高十九公尺，共用三万四千三百个工日。定西县安家铺沟的土坝约投入四万多个工日，资金四万多元。会宁县安家沟的土坝投入二十万个工日。由于大量的劳动力和资金投向土坝，以致土坝以上的谷坡和梁、峁坡面的其他水土保持措施很少进行。有些人认为，进行多项的水土保持工作会产生劳动力不足的矛盾，实际上是劳动力如何合理分配使用的问题。如果把大量劳动力只用于修坝，当然就无力进行其他的水土保持工作。
    应当指出，土坝被洪水冲毁的情况是很严重的。根据不完全的资料，山西在1956年洪水期中共计冲毁谷坊三千五百多座，坝一千多座；1956年夏季甘肃的坝被冲毁一千六百多座。甘肃庆阳县1956年春季修的三十六座坝，到同年7月底只剩下一座没有被冲坏。西北黄河工程局编写的“1956年8月8日陕北韭园沟、辛店沟暴雨中的水土流失情况和水土保持措施效果”报告中提到：韭园沟全流域小型土坝共计八十四个，1956年以前就被泥沙淤平了十四个，1956年8月8日遭遇到总历时二百七十五分钟、流域平均四十点七公厘的一次暴雨，结果土坝被泥沙淤平的有四十八个，被洪水部分冲毁的有十一个，全部冲毁的有七个。如果计算一下几年来山西、陕西、甘肃三省所有被冲毁的土坝的投资和劳力，损失何等惊人！有些人认为韭园沟流域的土坝被洪水冲毁和被泥沙淤平，是由于遭遇到百年来少有的暴雨。应当说明，季候风气候地带的暴雨频率目前还没有科学方法可以推算，特别是黄土高原的较大暴雨，可以隔几十年甚至百多年一次，也可以隔几年就有一次，甚至在几年之内连续出现。有些人又认为，土坝的冲毁是由于没有周密地选择坝址、正确地设计坝身并检查工程质量等，这些虽然也是一部分原因，但是更重要的原因是坝以上的广大集水面积，如果不加其他的水土保持措施，是不能缓和并减少坡面径流速度、径流量以及泥沙量的。
    同时土坝被泥沙淤积的情况也是很可怕的。陕西绥德县1953年修的韭园沟大型坝，坝高二十公尺，仅1954年坝上游淤积的泥沙量就达十公尺厚，经过1956年8月8日的洪水，已经全部淤平，现在坝顶加高了四公尺。无疑的，大量的泥沙主要是来自沟间地的坡面和沟谷的谷坡，坡面的冲刷如果不加以控制，水库很快就会被淤死。
    有人认为修小型土坝的目的就是希望很快淤积，因为淤地的农作物产量很高。这种把坡面上的土壤和肥料“搬家”到沟底，为求得小面积淤地的农作物的增产，招致大面积坡田的农作物的减产的办法，是不符合水土保持原则的。陕北群众打坝淤地的习惯是过去小农经济制度下的产物。
    有些人认为修大型土坝可以减小沟底冲刷，拦洪、拦泥，并且可以利用库水养鱼、灌溉、发电等。不可否认，大型土坝是有这些效能的，但是要在土坝不被洪水冲毁和不被泥沙淤平的条件下才能实现。黄土高原现存的大型坝当中，已经利用库水来养鱼的有多少，能发电的有多少，能灌溉的有多少，养了多少鱼，发了多少电，实际灌溉了多少农田等等，如果调查一下，情况是难于使人满意的。
    任何类型的土坝，被泥沙淤平以后只有两个办法：一个办法是继续把坝顶加高，如果再被淤平也只有再加高；另一个办法是在它的上游再修土坝，新修土坝再被淤平也只有在它的上游再来修建新的土坝。1956年10月间笔者陪同苏联科学院阿尔曼德教授到甘肃、陕西、山西三省考察，他也很怀疑地提出，这样继续下去，要到何时何地为止？进一步看，如果淤平的土坝，不采取上述两个办法，那么沟谷底部将形成一级一级的台状地，再经洪水漫溢，一定将要继续被冲刷，这不是理论上的推测，事实已经有证明。根据韭园沟水土保持站统计的十八个淤地坝，在1956年8月8日的洪水中，坝内原存的泥沙量，部分被洪水冲走的有十一个，计达一万四千六百六十七公方，全部被洪水冲走的有七个，计达二万八千公方，同时坝身也被冲坏或冲走。这样就连土坝的拦洪、拦泥沙、防止沟底冲刷的效能也都丧失了。
    有些人认为，为了减少即将修建成的三门峡水库的泥沙淤积，不得不赶快在黄土高原沟谷中修坝。但可惜的是，三门峡水库还没有施工时，1956年以前黄土高原所修的大量土坝，其中一部分被冲毁了，一部分淤平了，一部分坝的库容已经被淤减，不久就要失去拦泥作用了。如果要作全盘打算，就应该在三门峡水库进水以前，大力开展沟谷的集水面积的坡面治理，减少泥沙流失，等到三门峡水库将要进水的前一、二年，再在沟谷中大量修坝，岂不更能起到拦泥的作用？还有，邻近黄河干流的沟谷，暴雨一来，泥沙直接泻入黄河，而远离黄河干流的沟谷，洪水所携带的泥沙，在黄河的支流或支流的支流的河谷中，沿途都要发生堆积，虽然最后仍然要输入黄河，但是在时间上就远不如邻近黄河干流的沟谷那么急速，难道沟谷中修坝在地域上没有先后缓急吗？
    有些人又认为，防止水土流失，生物措施是永久的，但是太慢，工程措施是暂时的，但是很快。“生物措施”一词含义不很清楚，一般是指森林保持水土的措施。工程保持水土措施也不是单指在沟底修坝，还有坡面工程，如修梯田、筑地埂、挖水平沟等。这样把生物措施和工程措施对立起来看，是不对的。任何一种水土保持措施，都具有一定的效能，沟底修坝也不应该例外。不过，强调某一项措施，不但不会成功，反而要遭受失败。例如，沟间地中即使适合于修梯田的坡面，如果梯田田面不采取水簸箕、水平犁沟以及其他保持水土的耕作方法，梯田田边又不加筑地埂，地埂坡上又不加栽灌木，梯田将会被水流冲毁。沟谷中即使适宜于造林的荒坡，如果不采取水平沟或水平阶（坡面工程）的造林方法，树苗将难于栽活。即使沟谷谷坡已经采取各种措施，如果不与沟间地坡面各种措施并进，谷坡将得不到应有的防冲效果。即使沟底适合修坝，如果不与沟谷谷坡和沟间地坡面各种治理相结合，土坝将会被洪水冲毁或被泥沙淤平。
    这不是完全否定沟底修坝具有水土保持的效能，因为它是水土保持综合措施中的一项。所反对的是，不看地域、不择时间、不管条件，而以单纯修坝作为水土保持工作的方针。
    笔者认为水土保持工作的方针，一定要在合理利用土地的原则下，通过生产合作组织，发动广大的人民群众，采取农、林、牧、水利以及田间工程和沟谷工程（包括沟底修土坝和谷坊等）的综合措施，来全面地同水土流失现象作斗争。各种水土保持措施，必须从上到下，既要照顾坡面又要照顾沟谷，对水和土要进行步步涵蓄、节节拦阻，只顾尾不顾头、顾下不顾上的做法是不对的。各种水土保持措施的本身之间，要全面配合，只重视任何一种措施，忽视其他措施的做法是不对的。
    如何进行水土保持工作
    黄土高原的水土保持是一个地域广大而性质复杂的工作，任务是十分艰巨的。不过，在我国今天农业合作化的基础上，既有条件合理利用土地，就有条件采取水土保持的综合措施。我认为，目前急需解决以下几个问题。
    第一、进行大地域的水土保持和土地合理利用的区划工作。黄土高原的生产发展方向应该是农、林、牧各生产部门的有机配合，这样才能采取农、林、牧、水利、田间工程和沟谷工程综合措施的水土保持工作的方针。但是辽阔的黄土高原，各地区的自然（气候、地质、地貌、水文、土壤、植物等）和经济（人口密度、劳动力数量、经济发展历史、经济现况以及生产上所存在的问题等）条件，都不相同，各地区水土流失的程度及其对三门峡水库的影响，也有差异，各地区目前已经或未经利用的土地类型，在地面上的组合更有区别，因此必须进行水土保持和土地合理利用的区划工作。这是一件繁重的科学工作。中国科学院黄河中游水土保持综合考察队于1955年到1956年间曾经在晋西、陕北、陇中等地区做过这种工作，他们已经取得了不少经验。但这种区划必须同国民经济规划符合，还需要农、林、牧各生产部门会商，作周详考虑以后再制定。
    第二、进行小沟流域的水土保持和土地合理利用的规划工作。在上述区划的每一分区内选择有代表性的面积十到十五平方公里的小沟流域（有些可利用现有水土保持站已经选定的），使农业生产合作社土地的范围同小沟流域的界线符合，并在其中设立水土保持站，做出典型小区的水土保持和土地合理利用的规划。根据小沟流域的农业生产合作社的劳动力条件，在一个较短的年限内来完成这个远景规划。在这个年限内，作出分期实施的计划和说明书，特别在第一期年限内，作出每年实施计划图和说明书。所有实施计划，在时间上同地面上要取得统一，但不能违背两个原则：一个是各种水土保持措施由上而下，从沟间地的分水岭到坡面，从沟谷的谷坡到沟底，如果劳动力缺乏，非遇到特殊情况，不先在沟底修坝；另一个是各种水土保持措施本身的相互结合，特别是工程措施和森林措施的结合。典型小沟流域内的水土保持站，应该尽快编制水土保持手册，分送有关的农业生产合作社。水土保持站还应该进行各种有关的试验研究，特别是各种水土保持措施效益的观察和试验，不断修正手册上的各种水土保持措施的实施规格。任何一种水土保持措施，要想制定一种规格来应用在整个黄土高原是不会成功的。这个规划工作也包括繁重的科学工作。中国科学院黄河中游水土保持综合考察队于1955到1956年曾经在山西的离山、兴县和甘肃的定西、会宁县做过这种规划，有了一些经验。但这种规划必须符合合作社的生产条件，仍然需要地方上的生产领导者、水土保持站工作人员和农业生产合作社社员共同会商同意以后，再制定并贯彻执行。
    第三、健全组织机构，加强领导力量。几年来，黄土高原的水土保持工作，不论中央或地方都是由水利部门领导的。可以看到，这项工作的方针和步骤，是只重视水利工程措施而忽视了其他措施，只治理沟底而不治理坡面。自然，水利部门应该进行水利工程措施，属于农、林、牧各生产部门的工作，不可能都要水利部门去干，在这方面苛责水利部门是不公道的。
    水土保持是一个综合性的工作，农、林、牧、水利各部门应该组成统一的联合阵线，不能孤军作战。建议在上述各部门之上，由国务院设立水土保持的专门机构，统筹领导，直接把水土保持工作的任务和经费交给地方；省、专区、县同样设立水土保持的专门机构，把水土保持工作向农村推动。水土保持是一项群众性的工作，它同各种生产是紧密结合的，群众不会不接受。水土保持站有责任向群众进行宣传教育，使水土保持知识普遍得到传播。
