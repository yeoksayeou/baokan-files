When many peasants lived individually, they often temporarily sold their revolving grain to meet urgent needs. However, at that time, the buying and selling were their own responsibility and did not concern others. But after they joined cooperatives, they would discuss the superiority of cooperatives from the perspective of the revolving grain problem.

In Datang Agricultural Cooperative, Lijingpu Township, Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, because of drought, ninety-seven cooperative members claimed they wanted to sell their revolving grain. Some cooperative members, especially middle peasants and those who were originally handicraftsmen, had the misconception that the income of these members who wanted to sell their revolving grain had decreased after joining the cooperative, and therefore complained that the cooperative was not good. These people did not fully calculate the accounts. The actual situation was that the income of the vast majority of people who wanted to sell their revolving grain had slightly increased compared to the previous year. Among them, most people had thin family assets and made large advances; some people did not include their income from working outside after joining the cooperative; some middle peasants carefully calculated later and found that not only did they not need to sell their revolving grain, but they could also receive dozens of yuan in cash. After the cooperative cadres helped them calculate the accounts specifically, those who nitpicked the cooperative on the revolving grain issue were also convinced.

However, the leading cadres of Datang Agricultural Cooperative did not just help the cooperative members who wanted to sell revolving grain to calculate their accounts and be done with it. They also helped the members who were preparing to sell revolving grain find ways to increase income and save money. Through specific arrangements, these members, relying on income from sideline occupations such as pig raising and income from cultivating overwintering crops, could not only buy back all the revolving grain but also have a surplus.

Other cooperatives where members sell revolving grain can conduct a specific study of this issue to see what difficulties those who sell revolving grain have and how they can be helped to buy back the revolving grain on time.

    周转粮产生的问题
    许多农民在单家独户过日子的时候，常常暂时卖出周转粮，以应急需。不过，那时的买和卖都由自己负责，不与别人相干。可是，在他们入了合作社以后，他们却会从周转粮问题上来谈论合作社的优越性。
    湖南宁乡县历经铺乡大塘农业社因为受了旱灾，有九十七户社员声称要出卖周转粮。有一部分社员，特别是中农和原来是手工业者的社员就产生了错觉，以为这些要卖周转粮的社员入社后收入减少了，因而埋怨合作社不好。这些人没有全面地算算账。实际情况是：绝大多数要卖周转粮的人，收入都比上一年稍有增加。他们之中，多数人的家底薄，预支多；有些人入社后外出做工收入没有计算进去；有的中农后来仔细一算，不但不需要出卖周转粮，而且还可以分到几十元现金。经过社干部帮助他们具体算账，那些在周转粮问题上挑合作社的毛病的人也心服了。
    但是，大塘农业社的领导干部并没有满足于帮助要出卖周转粮的社员算算账就完事，他们还帮助准备出卖周转粮的社员找出了增加收入和节约的办法，通过具体安排，这些社员依靠养猪等副业收入和培育越冬作物的收入，除了可以买回全部周转粮外，还有剩余。
    其他地方有社员出卖周转粮的合作社，都可以把这个问题作一番具体的研究，看看那些出卖周转粮的社员有什么困难，怎样才可以帮助他们把周转粮按时买回来。
