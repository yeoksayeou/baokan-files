Is the Speed of Agricultural Increase in Our Country Fast or Slow?

(Continued from yesterday)

Some people have this question: The degree of agricultural mechanization in our country is not high, the supply of chemical fertilizers is limited, and the construction of large-scale water conservancy projects has only just begun. Why is the speed of agricultural increase so fast compared with many countries?

Others have this question: Old China was a so-called "country of famine"; for nearly half a century, it was mired in the flames of war; and according to historical records, the restoration of agricultural production after the war was very difficult (for example, after the First World War, it took Germany sixteen years to restore its main grain production to pre-war levels, and France also took a long eleven years; after the Second World War, the agricultural production of countries such as Japan, West Germany, France, and Italy also took five or even seven years to recover to pre-war levels). Then why is the growth rate of agricultural production so prominent since the liberation of China?

To answer this question, it is necessary to discuss many aspects such as the entire national political system and economic system, which inevitably involves too much. Here, we only make the most concise analysis.

First of all, after the victory of the People's Liberation War, the broad masses of working farmers, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party, realized the reform of the land system throughout the country. This not only satisfied the wishes of the landless and land-poor peasants, but also meant that the more than 30 million tons of grain rent that they had to pay to the landlords every year now belonged to them. It is not difficult to imagine the enormous role this played in boosting farmers' enthusiasm for production and increasing investment in farmers' means of production.

Secondly, the success of the agricultural socialist transformation with world significance changed the old relations of production, established new labor organizations, and, under the vigorous leadership and assistance of the state, improved farmers' labor efficiency and production enthusiasm. In recent years, the number of farmers participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations has increased year by year. For example, in 1950, only 10.7% of farmers joined mutual aid and cooperation organizations. By 1952, it had increased to 40%, and in 1955, it had further increased to 63%. By June 1956, it had reached 91.7%, and all had become agricultural production cooperatives, most of which had become advanced cooperatives.

Countless examples prove that after the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives, more than 80% of the cooperatives increased production by 10%-30%. From a national perspective, in 1955, more than 630,000 cooperatives participated in the autumn harvest distribution, and by the end of the year, it had increased to more than 1.9 million, and the area collectively managed by cooperative farmers had reached more than one billion mu, accounting for about 64% of the total cultivated land area in the country. In this year, according to surveys in the main production areas of various crops, the yield per unit area of ​​cooperatives significantly exceeded that of general individual farmers: rice yielded 10% more, wheat 7% more, soybeans 19% more, and cotton 26% more.

Thirdly, there is the unprecedented great struggle against nature launched in recent years.

According to Zhu Kezhen's estimate in the book "Changes in China's Climate," within the eighteen provinces of China proper, from the first century AD to the nineteenth century, a total of 658 floods and 1,013 droughts occurred. According to Deng Yunte's estimate in the book "History of Famine Relief in China," from 1766 BC (the 18th year of Shang Tang) to 1937 AD, a total of 5,258 disasters including floods, droughts, locusts, hail, wind, epidemics, earthquakes, frost, and snow occurred in 3,703 years. After the disasters, as recorded in history, it was often "thousands of miles of red land, all crops destroyed," and "people ate grass and trees, and there were many abandoned children on the roads." Farmers called it "relying on the sky for food," and agricultural production had no guarantee.

After liberation, the Party and the government led hundreds of millions of people to carry out unremitting struggles against natural disasters with the greatest strength, and the results were even more significant, especially in the construction of water conservancy projects. Everyone knows that the Yellow River is one of China's major disasters. In 1934, during the Kuomintang rule, the maximum flood flow (based on the flow of Qinchang near Zhengzhou, the same below) was only 8,500 cubic meters per second, but the Yellow River breached its banks in Changyuan, Henan, inundating six counties. In 1935, the maximum flood flow was 13,300 cubic meters per second, and the Yellow River breached its banks again in Juancheng, Shandong, inundating more than a dozen counties in Shandong and Jiangsu, affecting more than 2 million people. But after the founding of the People's Republic of China, in 1954, the maximum flood flow reached 14,000 cubic meters per second, but the Yellow River was safe and sound.

Of course, we have not been established for long, and it is impossible to complete all the projects that need to be built quickly. Therefore, when we encountered such a major flood as in 1954, although the Yellow River was safe, the Yangtze River basin was also flooded. In the past, when farmers encountered disasters, they had no choice but to leave their homes and flee everywhere; but today, they rely on the collective strength to rush to plant and replant, and produce to save themselves from disasters. This greatly reduced the original losses. Although the disaster situation in 1954 was quite serious, the final production results, compared with the normal year of 1953, the harvest of major agricultural products could still reach the following proportions: rice 99, wheat 128, soybeans 91, miscellaneous grains 97, cotton 91. However, during the Kuomintang rule, such as in 1934, a flood also occurred, affecting eleven provinces including Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui. At that time, this was not the most serious disaster, but according to the subsequent survey by the so-called "Central Agricultural Experiment Station," the output of its agricultural products compared with normal years was as follows: rice 63, sorghum 73, corn 71, millet 75, soybeans 70, cotton 64.

Finally, it must also be pointed out that the broad masses of farmers who have been emancipated in recent years have paid amazing labor in the research and practice of increasing production technology.

The problem is obvious. Since 1949, the expansion of cultivated land area in my country has not been too much compared with the increase in output, and it only increased by 11 million hectares by 1955. However, the sown area has increased by nearly 20 million hectares for food crops alone, which is mainly the result of changing the cropping system and increasing the multiple cropping index. While expanding the sown area, there have also been outstanding performances in increasing the yield per unit area.

Rice, the national average yield per mu in 1949 was only 250 jin; by 1955, it had increased to more than 356 jin, an increase of 42%. As for individual regions, such as Chao'an County, Guangdong, the average yield per mu in the county in 1949 was only 577 jin, but in 1955 it rose to more than 1,017 jin, an increase of 76.3%. Therefore, this county was short of 24.82 million jin of grain in 1951, but by 1955, it had a surplus of 24.65 million jin. In 1955 alone, there were three counties with an average yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu in Guangdong Province alone.

Another example is cotton. Nationwide, the average yield of unginned cotton per mu in 1949 was only 21.4 jin, but in 1955 it increased to more than 35 jin, an increase of 66%. As for individual regions, such as the Manas River Basin in Xinjiang, when cotton was first planted in 1950, the average yield of seed cotton per mu was only 50.2 jin, but in 1955 it rose to more than 400 jin, an increase of more than seven times. Another example is Cixi County, Zhejiang, where the average yield of ginned cotton per mu in the county in 1950 was only 39 jin, but in 1955 it rose to 79 jin, an increase of 102.8%.

If you want to look at the effect of overall production increase, you can look at Anhui Province. This province was a well-known disaster area before liberation, and the production level was very low. In 1949, the province's total grain output was only 9.1 billion jin. In recent years, due to the harnessing of the Huai River, the development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and the reform of agricultural technology, the grain output in 1955 reached 22.7 billion jin, which not only increased by 150% compared with 1949, but also exceeded the province's target set by the Five-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule. Other products such as cotton, tea, and silkworm cocoons also exceeded the target.

Of course, the above examples can also illustrate another problem, that is, the level of agricultural production in our country in the early days of liberation was quite low; therefore, after effective rectification, the speed of its rise was relatively easy to stand out. However, precisely because the past production level was low, the production potential was also greater. With the realization of agricultural cooperation, the development speed of agriculture and its sideline industries will inevitably be further improved.

The facts are exactly like this.

In 1956, ten provinces in the central region, such as Jiangsu and Anhui, suffered severe typhoons and rainstorms during the busy farming season in May and June. Soon, the south experienced drought and the north experienced floods. According to the latest survey, the affected area was comparable to that of 1954. However, according to the estimate of the recently held National Agricultural Work Conference, the annual national food crops and economic crops such as cotton, oilseeds, and sugar crops not only greatly exceeded the output of 1954, but also significantly increased compared with the bumper harvest of 1955. Among them, grain increased by 5.4%, cotton increased by nearly 4%, and the output of rice, wheat, potatoes, miscellaneous grains, flue-cured tobacco, and tea in 1956 all exceeded the production targets for the last year of the First Five-Year Plan - 1957.

This is the most concrete manifestation of the superiority of agricultural cooperation. As mentioned earlier, in June 1956, the number of farmer households joining cooperatives reached 91.7% of the total number of households in the country. In 1954, it was only 10.9%. Therefore, in 1956, the country completed the expansion and improvement of irrigation for about 150 million mu of farmland, which greatly exceeded the total number completed in the six years after liberation. For example, in terms of changing the cropping system (such as changing single-season to double-season), Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Anhui provinces alone increased grain production by 7 billion jin.

It should be known that this is still the first year that agricultural cooperation has been basically realized nationwide, and it is still the result achieved under the circumstances that many rural workers lack experience in leading this relatively large-scale agricultural economy. In the future, not only will our work experience become richer, but also the increasingly developed national industry will be able to give agriculture more support. Therefore, it is entirely possible to continue to improve the speed of agricultural increase in our country. Therefore, according to the agricultural production targets stipulated in the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan, the total grain output will reach about 500 billion jin by 1962, an increase of about 30% compared with the original planned number for 1957, while in the First Five-Year Plan, 1957 only increased by 17.6% compared with 1952; as for cotton, it will reach about 48 million dan by 1962, an increase of 47% compared with the original planned number for 1957, while in the First Five-Year Plan, 1957 only increased by 25.4% compared with 1952. As for the overall aspect, by 1962, the total agricultural output value will increase by about 35% compared with the original planned number for 1957, which is a significant increase compared with the growth rate of 23.3% in the First Five-Year Plan.

However, it must also be recognized that our country has a large population and is increasing rapidly, and people's lives are constantly improving, and the demand is getting bigger and bigger. We need to increase agricultural production more, and we must not be blindly satisfied with the existing achievements.

    我国农业增产速度是快还是慢
    华恕
    （续昨）
    有人有这样的疑问：我国农业机械化的程度不高，化学肥料的供应有限，大规模水利工程的建设也刚开始不久，为什么同很多国相家比，农业增产的速度会这么快呢？
    还有人有这样的疑问：旧中国是一个所谓“灾荒的国度”；近半世纪以来，又长期陷于战争炮火之中；而根据历史的记载，战后农业生产的恢复，很不容易（如第一次世界大战之后，德国的主要谷物产量，经过了十六年之久，才恢复到战前水平，法国的主要谷物产量的恢复也经过了漫长的十一年；第二次世界大战之后，日本、西德、法国、意大利等国的农业生产，也都经过了五年甚至七年的时间，才恢复到战前的水平）；那么中国解放以后农业生产增长的速度为什么会这样突出呢？
    要解答这个问题，势必论及整个国家的政治体系、经济制度等许多方面，难免牵涉过广。在这里，我们只作最扼要的分析。
    首先要提出的是，在人民解放战争胜利之后，广大的劳动农民，在共产党的正确领导下，在全国范围内实现了土地制度的改革。这样，不但满足了无地少地的农民的愿望，而且使他们原来每年要为地主交纳的三千万吨以上的粮食的地租，从此归他们自己所有。不难想像，这对于鼓舞农民的生产积极性和增加农民的生产资料的投资，有着多么巨大的作用。
    其次是具有世界意义的农业社会主义改造的成功，改变了旧的生产关系，建立了新的劳动组织，在国家的大力领导和援助下，提高了农民的劳动效率和生产积极性。几年来，参加互助合作组织的农户，一年比一年增多。如在1950年时：加入了互助合作组织的农户，还只占总农户的10.7％，到1952年就增加到40％，1955年更增加到了63％。而1956年6月，已达91.7％，并且都已经成为农业生产合作社，大部分成了高级社。
    无数的事例证明，农业生产合作社建立以后，80％以上的社，都要增产10％—30％。从全国范围来说，如1955年参加秋收分配的社，共六十三万多个，年底，又增加到一百九十万多个，入社农户的集体经营的面积，已达十亿亩以上，占全国总耕地面积64％左右。这一年，据在各种农作物主要产区的调查，合作社的单位面积产量，显著地超过了一般个体农民：稻谷多产10％、小麦多产7％、大豆多产19％、棉花多产26％。
    再其次是几年来所发动的史无前例的对大自然的巨大的斗争。
    据竺可桢在“中国气候之变迁”一书中的估计，在我国本部十八省的范围内，自纪元一世纪至十九世纪，共发生水灾六百五十八次，旱灾一千零十三次。又据邓云特在“中国救荒史”一书中的估计，自纪元前1766年（商汤18年）至纪元后1937年的三千七百零三年内，共发生水、旱、蝗、雹、风、疫、地震、霜、雪等灾害五千二百五十八次。而灾荒之后，如史册所载，往往是“赤地千里、禾稼尽绝”，“人食草木，道多弃儿”。农民自称“靠天吃饭”，农业生产毫无保障。
    解放后，党和政府以最大的力量，领导亿万人民对自然灾害，进行了不懈的斗争，特别是在水利工程的建设上，成效更加显著。谁都知道，黄河是中国的大患之一，1934年国民党统治时期，洪水的最大流量（以郑州附近秦厂的流量为准，以下同）只有八千五百秒公方，黄河却在河南长垣决口四处，淹及六个县。1935年的洪水最大流量为一万三千三百秒公方，黄河又在山东鄄城大决口，淹及山东、江苏十几个县，受灾二百余万人。但是在中华人民共和国成立以后，1954年的洪水最大流量，达一万四千秒公方，黄河却安然无恙。
    当然，我们建国未久，还不可能把需要建设的工程，很快地就一一完成。因此遇到1954年那样的特大洪水时，黄河虽然无恙，但在长江流域，却也曾泛滥成灾。从前，农民遇到了灾荒，只有离乡背井，四处逃亡；而今天却是依靠集体的力量，抢种补种，生产救灾。这就大大地减轻了原有的损失。虽然1954年的灾情相当严重，但最后的生产成果，比起平常年景的1953年来，主要农产物的收成还能达到如下的比例：稻谷九十九、小麦一百二十八、大豆九十一、杂粮九十七、棉花九十一。可是，在国民党统治时期，如1934年亦曾发生水灾，波及鄂、湘、赣、皖等十一个省，当时这还不算最严重的灾情，但据所谓“中央农业实验所”事后的调查，其农产品的产量与平常年相比如下：稻谷六十三、高粱七十三、玉米七十一、小米七十五、大豆七十、棉花六十四。
    最后还必须指出的是几年来翻身后的广大农民，在增产技术的钻研和实践方面支付了惊人的劳动。
    问题很明显，自1949年以来，我国耕地面积的扩大比起产量的增长，不算太多，到1955年才增加了一千一百万公顷。可是播种面积，仅粮食作物就增加了近两千万公顷，这主要是改变耕作制度，增加复种指数的成效。而在扩大播种面积的同时，在单位面积产量的提高上，也有着出色的表现。
    水稻，1949年全国每亩平均产量才二百五十斤；到1955年就提高到三百五十六斤以上，增长了42％。至于个别地区，如广东潮安县，1949年全县平均每亩产量只有五百七十七斤，到1955年即上升到一千零十七斤多，增长了76.3％。因此这个县在1951年时，还缺粮二千四百八十二万斤，但到1955年就有余粮二千四百六十五万斤了。像这样全县每亩产量超过一千斤的县，仅1955年在广东一省就出现了三个。
    又如棉花，在全国范围内，1949年每亩平均产皮棉才二十一点四斤，到1955年即提高到三十五斤以上，增长了66％。至于个别地区，如新疆玛纳斯河流域，1950年初种棉花时，每亩平均产籽棉才五十点二斤，到1955年即上升到四百斤以上，增长了七倍多。又如浙江慈溪县1950年全县每亩平均才产皮棉三十九斤，到1955年就上升到七十九斤，增长了102.8％。
    如果要从全面增产的效果来看，可以看看安徽省。这个省，在解放以前，是出名的灾区，生产水平很低。1949年时，全省粮食产量只有九十一亿斤。几年来，由于修治了淮河，发展了互助合作组织，进行了农业技术的改革，1955年粮食产量达二百二十七亿斤，不但比1949年增长了150％，而且还提前两年超额完成了五年计划规定的这个省的指标，其他如棉花、茶叶、蚕茧等也都超额完成了任务。
    当然，以上这些事例也可以说明另外一个问题，那就是我国解放初期的农业生产水平是相当低的；因此，经过切实的整顿以后，其上升的速度，也就相对地易于突出。然而，正由于过去生产水平较低，所以生产的潜力也较大，随着农业合作化的实现，农业及其副业的发展速度，势必更加提高。
    事实正是这样。
    1956年，中部地区如江苏、安徽等十个省，正当五、六月间农事紧张的季节，遭受了严重的台风和暴雨的袭击。不久，南方发生干旱，北方发生水灾。最后调查，受灾面积与1954年不相上下。可是，据最近召开的全国农业工作会议的预计，全年全国粮食作物和棉花、油料、糖料等经济作物，不但大大超过了1954年的产量，而且比丰收的1955年，仍然显著增产。其中粮食增长5.4％，棉花增长将近4％，而且1956年的稻谷、小麦、薯类、杂粮和烤烟、茶叶的产量，都超过了第一个五年计划最后一年——1957年的生产指标。
    这就是农业合作化优越性的最具体的表现。前面说过，1956年6月，入社农户已达全国总农户91.7％。而在1954年时，还只有10.9％。所以在1956年内，全国大约完成了一亿五千万亩农田灌溉的扩大和改善的工程，这个数字，大大超过了解放六年中所完成的总数。又如在改变耕作制度方面（如单季改双季等），仅江苏、浙江、福建和安徽四个省，就因而增产粮食七十亿斤。
    应该知道，这还是全国范围内基本上实现了农业合作化的第一年，也还是在许多农村工作人员领导这种比较大规模的农业经济还缺乏经验的情况下所取得的成绩。以后，不但我们的工作经验日益丰富，而且越来越发达的国家工业，也越来越能给农业以更多的支援。因此，我国农业增产的速度的继续提高，是完全可能的。所以按照党中央对第二个五年计划建议中所规定的农业生产的指标，到1962年粮食的总产量要达到五千亿斤左右，比1957年的原计划数增长30％左右，而第一个五年计划中，1957年比1952年只增长17.6％；还有棉花，到1962年要达到四千八百万担左右，比1957年原计划数增长47％，而第一个五年计划中，1957年比1952年只增长25.4％。至于总的方面，到1962年农业增产总值要比1957年原计划数增长35％左右，这又比第一个五年计划增长23.3％的速度，有显著的提高。
    不过，也必须认识到，我国人口众多，增殖很快，人民生活也在不断改善，需要量越来越大。我们还需要更多增加农业生产，决不能盲目地满足现有的成绩。
                                  （完）
