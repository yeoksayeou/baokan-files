    Giving Full Play to the Power of the People's Representatives
    ——A Record of the People's Congress Meeting in Xindeng County
    Wu Ming
    The second session of the first People's Congress of Xindeng County, Zhejiang Province, was held on October 14, 1956. The meeting focused on summarizing the experience of the County People's Committee in various tasks over the past two years, examining the shortcomings in the work and the work style of cadres, and discussing and formulating the main tasks for 1957 and winter, and elected the county head, deputy county head, and members of the County People's Committee.
    Throughout the meeting, the spirit of fully promoting democracy and respecting the democratic rights of representatives was implemented, and the role of the organ of power was effectively brought into play in elections and the discussion and decision of major issues.
    One of the main gains of the meeting was the criticism of bureaucracy in the government's work and the establishment of a pragmatic work style. Judging from the many examples cited by the representatives, some cadres in the county had serious subjective tendencies in their thinking. For example, blindly changing farming methods was a prominent example. A representative from Gaoping Township pointed out that the promotion of continuous cropping of rice without considering the specific conditions in various places resulted in very little harvest from more than 3,000 mu of rice fields in the township. Representative Shen Fengying pointed out that Li Chuan, the head of the agricultural technology extension station, insisted last spring that our cooperative plant double-cropping rice in wheat fields, resulting in no harvest and a loss of more than 1,000 jin of rice seeds.
    Another gain of the meeting was the enhancement of the legal awareness of representatives and cadres and the further establishment of a democratic work style. Representatives criticized the failure to hold county and township People's Congress meetings and township People's Committee meetings on schedule. They also criticized and self-criticized the unclear responsibilities of Party, government, and cooperative cadres in the townships, and the failure of township political power to play its role. They believed that this was not in line with the provisions of the Constitution and laws, and must be corrected in the future. The criticism and self-criticism carried out at the meeting was very educational for the representatives. They reflected: "We have truly learned criticism and self-criticism at this meeting. In the future, we must use this weapon in our work as we did at this meeting." In addition, many representatives realized the democratic essence of our country through repeated discussions of candidates and elections.
    The reason why this meeting could be held well was primarily due to thorough preparation. Notices of the meeting and the preparation of proposals were issued more than ten days in advance. Representatives reflected: This time, we can not only properly arrange our work in advance, but also have enough time to widely solicit the masses' requirements for the conference. On the other hand, the main reports of the conference were printed in advance to solicit opinions from all parties. In particular, the government work report was sent to various departments, township People's Committees, and some democratic figures to solicit opinions, and was revised and supplemented three times in the County People's Committee and twice in the administrative meeting. As a result, the representatives were satisfied with the content of the report.
    Full democracy was promoted, criticism and self-criticism were carried out, and the work and cadre work style of the previous People's Committee were carefully examined at this meeting, basically achieving a free and unconstrained exchange of ideas. At first, some representatives were worried about conducting criticism. The leading comrades enlightened them in many ways to dispel their concerns. For example, Representative Chen Jiafu brought many opinions from elementary school teachers and was prepared to put them forward at the meeting, but hesitated. Later, seeing that the leadership of the meeting was very democratic, he put them forward without any worries. The conference immediately accepted the correct suggestions and criticisms put forward by the representatives and improved the work accordingly. For example, after the representatives criticized the government's work for being blind and not in line with the actual situation, the meeting emphasized the spirit of adapting to local conditions, adapting to the times, and giving play to the initiative of various places when discussing and formulating future tasks. Therefore, the tasks determined were more realistic, and the representatives felt that their power was truly respected. Full democracy was also manifested in the election of the county head, deputy county head, and members of the People's Committee. After the joint list was put forward, the representatives carefully reviewed each candidate, made necessary replacements for individual inappropriate candidates, and put forward more appropriate candidates after discussion. The representatives also criticized the shortcomings in the work of some candidates.
    Whether the meeting is held well or not is closely related to the leadership of the presidium. The presidium of this meeting fully played its core leadership role. All major issues were decided after unified research by the presidium and then submitted to the conference for discussion and approval. When deliberating on candidates, some representatives nominated Ma Wanhu as deputy county head, while others agreed that he should be a member. The number of people on both sides was similar, and they were at a standstill. After repeated study, the presidium timely put forward the reasons why Comrade Ma Wanhu should be nominated as a member, and it was smoothly adopted by the representatives. During group discussions, members of the presidium participated in the meetings of various groups to deeply understand the situation, discover problems, and study and solve them in a timely manner.
    This meeting was also led by the leadership to organize keynote speeches at the conference in a purposeful way. Eighteen representatives spoke at the meeting, covering various aspects, including criticism, suggestions, and the introduction of advanced production experiences. Through the keynote speeches at the conference, representatives from various strata introduced each other's work and production situation, strengthened unity and cooperation in work. Initially, rural representatives had many opinions on the fact that rice mill workers could not process a large amount of feed, believing that rice mill workers were not active enough in supporting agricultural production. The rice mill worker representative reported on the production situation at the conference, explaining that the factory's equipment was simple and it was indeed difficult to fully meet the needs of farmers for feed. At the same time, he represented all the factory's employees in guaranteeing that they would produce 50% more feed in 1957 than in 1956 to support farmers' need to raise 30,000 pigs. This eliminated the misunderstanding of the farmer representatives and strengthened the unity of workers and peasants and consolidated the worker-peasant alliance.
    In order to assist the representatives in implementing the resolutions of the conference among the masses, this meeting also absorbed township heads who were not county representatives to attend the meeting as nonvoting delegates, and after the conference, the township heads were given specific arrangements, requesting that each township convene a meeting of the People's Congress or the Township People's Committee to implement the resolutions of the County People's Congress, and to adhere to the People's Congress system and truly give play to the role of the organ of power.

    充分发挥人民代表的权力
    ——记新登县人民代表大会会议
    吴明
    浙江省新登县于1956年10月14日召开了第二届人民代表大会第一次会议。会议着重总结了县人民委员会二年来各项工作的经验，检查了工作中的缺点和干部的工作作风，并且讨论制定了1957年和冬季各项主要工作任务，选举了县长、副县长和县人民委员会委员。
    这次会议，自始至终贯串着充分发扬民主、尊重代表民主权利的精神，在选举和讨论决定重大问题上，切实发挥了权力机关的作用。
    会议的主要收获之一是批判了政府工作中的官僚主义，树立了实事求是的工作作风。从代表们列举的许多事例来看，这个县有些干部思想上的主观主义是很严重的，如盲目改变耕作方法就是一个突出的例子。高平乡代表提出，推广连作稻不考虑各地具体条件，致使该乡三千多亩稻田很少收成；沈凤英代表提出，农业技术推广站站长李川同志去年春天一定要我社在麦田中种双季稻，结果颗粒未收，还损失了一千多斤稻种。
    会议的另一个收获是，提高了代表和干部的法制观念，进一步树立了民主作风。代表们对不按期召开县、乡人民代表大会会议和乡人民委员会会议提出了批评，对乡的党、政、社干部职责不清，乡政权未能发挥作用等，也进行了批评和自我批评，认为这是不符合宪法和法律规定的，今后必须加以纠正。在会上开展批评和自我批评，对代表的教育很大，他们反映：“这次会上才真正学会了批评与自我批评，今后工作中必须和这次会议一样运用这一武器。”此外许多代表从反复讨论候选人和选举当中，体会到我们国家的民主实质。
    这次会议所以能开得好，首先是做了充分的准备工作。早在会前十几天就发出了开会和准备提案的通知。代表们反映：这回开会不但能事先妥善安排自己的工作，并且有充分的时间广泛征求群众对大会的要求。另一方面，大会的主要报告，都事先印出，广泛征求各方面的意见。特别是把政府工作报告，事先发给各部门、各乡人民委员会和一部分民主人士征求意见，又三次在县人民委员会和两次在行政会议上进行了修改补充。因而代表们对报告的内容感到满意。
    这次会议中充分发扬了民主，开展批评与自我批评，认真检查了上届人民委员会的工作和干部作风，基本做到了畅所欲言。最初有的代表对进行批评有顾虑，领导同志就多方启发，解除代表的顾虑。例如陈家福代表带来了很多小学教师的意见，准备在会上提出，但犹豫不决，后来看到大会领导很民主，就毫无顾虑地提出来了。大会对于代表提出的正确的建议和批评，都立即接受，并据以改进工作。如代表们批评政府工作有盲目性，不符合下情以后，会议在讨论制订今后任务时，就强调了因地制宜、因时制宜、发挥各地主动性的精神，因而确定的任务比较切合实际，代表也感到自己的权力真正受到了尊重。充分发扬民主，还表现在选举县长、副县长和人民委员会委员上。联合名单提出以后，代表对每个候选人都作了认真的审查，对个别不适当的候选人，进行了必要的更换，经过讨论，提出了更适当的候选人。代表们对某些候选人的工作缺点也提出了批评。
    会议开得好坏，同主席团的领导有很大关系。这次会议的主席团充分发挥了核心领导作用，一切重大问题都经过主席团统一研究后作出决定，再提交大会讨论通过。在酝酿候选人时，有些代表提名马万虎为副县长，有些代表却同意他为委员，两方面人数相仿，相持不下。主席团经过反复研究，及时提出马万虎同志应提为委员的理由后，便顺利地为代表所通过。小组讨论时，主席团成员分别参加各个小组的会议，深入地了解情况，发现问题，及时研究解决。
    这次会议还有领导有目的地组织了大会发言。在会上发言的有十八名代表，内容包括各个方面，有批评，有建议，也有先进生产经验的介绍。通过大会发言，各个阶层的代表相互介绍了工作和生产情况，加强了团结和工作上的配合。最初农村代表对米厂工人不能大量加工饲料有不少意见，认为米厂工人支援农业生产不够积极。米厂工人代表在大会上报告了生产情况，说明该厂设备简陋，全部满足农民对饲料的需要确有困难，同时也代表全厂职工提出保证，在1957年将比1956年多生产饲料50％，来支援农民养猪三万头的需要，这就消除了农民代表的误解，加强了工人和农民的团结，巩固了工农联盟。
    为了协助代表把大会决议贯彻到群众中去，这次会议还吸收了不是县代表的乡长列席会议，并且在大会结束后又给各乡乡长做了具体布置，要求各乡召开人民代表大会会议或乡人民委员会时贯彻县人民代表大会的决议，并且要坚持人民代表大会制度，真正发挥权力机关的作用。
