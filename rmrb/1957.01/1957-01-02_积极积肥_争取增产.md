    Hebei Takes Various Measures to
    Reward Members for Accumulating More Fertilizer
    The winter fertilizer accumulation campaign has already started in rural areas of Hebei Province. According to statistics from early December 1956, the province has already accumulated more than 129.7 billion catties of fertilizer. Chengde Prefecture, where the fertilizer accumulation campaign is progressing well, has already completed 74% of its winter fertilizer accumulation plan, with an average of about 4,000 catties of manure fertilizer per mu of cultivated land.
    Many agricultural cooperatives have adopted reasonable reward methods for winter fertilizer accumulation. For example, the cooperative contracts production to the teams, rewarding them for exceeding production targets, with fertilizer accumulated and used by the teams themselves. The cooperative also rewards individual members for accumulating fertilizer by combining cash payments with work points or cash payments with investments. They also give certain material rewards for breeding piglets, etc. These methods have all encouraged the enthusiasm of members for accumulating fertilizer. In Shijiazhuang Prefecture, the counties have adopted reward methods for raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer. Not only have they completed more than 90% of the annual pig-raising plan, but according to the understanding of Xinle and 20 other counties, they have also accumulated more than 9.6 billion catties of fertilizer.
    Before and after the start of the fertilizer accumulation campaign, agricultural cooperatives in various places cleared the dates for fertilizer accumulation, reasonably adjusted the prices of various types of soil and manure fertilizers, and dispelled the concerns of some members who believed that fertilizer accumulation was unrewarded or unreasonably rewarded. At the same time, agricultural cooperatives also paid attention to rationally arranging labor and mobilizing members to actively find ways to explore fertilizer sources. Lincheng County discovered that the accumulated fallen leaves in a deep mountain gully forest were more than a foot thick, so they mobilized members to use the leaves to make compost fertilizer. Forty-one agricultural cooperatives in Huangmi, Haozhuang and other townships are expected to use leaves to compost more than 44,000 cartloads of fertilizer.

    Mongolian Herdsmen Sell Sheep Manure to
    Actively Support Agricultural Production
    Mongolian herdsmen near the Jining-Erenhot Railway sell large quantities of sheep manure to supply rural areas outside the region as fertilizer. Since the official opening of the Jining-Erenhot Railway on January 4, 1956, Mongolian herdsmen in the Right Wing Rear Banner of Chahar, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, have transported 20 million catties of sheep manure to Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong and other provinces by rail. Recently, more than 30 counties in Shanxi and other provinces have signed contracts with the supply and marketing cooperative of this banner to continue purchasing more than 20 million catties of sheep manure fertilizer from the herdsmen.
    A large amount of sheep manure accumulates in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia every year, but it was not fully utilized in the past due to inconvenient transportation. After being transported out by train in 1956, selling sheep manure became an important sideline income for herdsmen. For example, in 1956, the income of herdsmen in the Right Wing Rear Banner of Chahar from selling sheep manure reached more than 180,000 yuan. According to some Han farmers in Shanxi Province who received the supply of sheep manure, this fertilizer is low in price and highly effective, and played a role in their agricultural production increase in 1956.

    "Everyone Accumulates Fertilizer, Every Household Composts"
    Xiangxiang County Launches Fertilizer Accumulation Upsurge
    The winter fertilizer accumulation work in Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, has formed a movement. All 754 agricultural cooperatives in the county have mobilized more than 70,000 people every day, and have currently accumulated more than 17 million dan of fertilizer.
    At the end of November and the beginning of December, the cooperatives understood the fertilizer accumulation situation and found that it was far from meeting the needs of this year's production. For example, the Xilin cooperative in Jinshi Township was still two-thirds short. The director of this cooperative immediately convened the management committee to find eight sources of fertilizer, formulate a fertilizer accumulation plan, and allocate the fertilizer accumulation task to the teams. Then, each team allocated the task to the households according to labor and population. On December 3, all more than 200 male and female laborers in the cooperative were fully投入into the fertilizer accumulation upsurge, and they picked more than 12,000 dan of pond mud on the first day.
    Some townships and cooperatives have also launched fertilizer accumulation competitions. The members of the advanced cooperatives in Meiqiao Township put forward the slogan "Everyone accumulates fertilizer, every household composts", and accumulated 40,000 dan of fertilizer in three days. In the competition, the members of the Yanjing cooperative in Lianhua Township scraped off all more than 1,800 field ridges, and also dug up the turf on the barren flats and swept up the leaves on the mountains, achieving "no (clumps of) weeds anywhere in the cooperative, and manure ponds in every field"; moreover, they have already turned over the more than 3,900 compost pits once.

    积极积肥  争取增产
    河北采取各种办法
    奖励社员多多积肥
    冬季积肥运动已经在河北省农村开展起来。据1956年12月上旬统计，全省已经积肥一千二百九十七亿多斤。积肥运动开展得较好的承德专区各县，冬季积肥计划已经完成74％，平均每亩耕地已有粪肥四千斤左右。
    不少农业社对冬季积肥采取了合理的奖励办法。例如社对各队包工包产，超产奖励，肥料以队为单位自积自用；社对社员个人积肥，采取给予现款与记工相结合或现款与投资相结合的处理办法；繁殖小猪给一定物质奖励等等。这些办法，都鼓舞了社员的积肥积极性。石家庄专区各县由于采取奖励养猪积肥的办法，现在不但已经完成全年养猪计划的90％以上，据新乐等二十个县了解，而且积了九十六亿多斤肥料。
    积肥运动开始前后，各地农业社清理了积肥的日期，合理地调整了各种土粪肥的价格，解除了部分社员认为积肥无报酬或报酬不合理的顾虑。同时，农业社还注意合理安排劳力，发动社员积极想办法挖掘肥源。临城县在一个深山沟的森林里发现积存的落叶有一尺多厚，就发动社员用树叶沤肥，皇迷、郝庄等乡的四十一个农业社，预计可以用树叶沤四万四千多车肥料。

    蒙族牧民出售羊粪
    积极支援农业生产
    集二铁路附近的蒙古族牧民出售大量羊粪，供应外地农村作肥料。自1956年1月4日集二铁路正式通车以来，内蒙古自治区察哈尔右翼后旗蒙古族牧民，通过铁路运到山西、河北和山东等省去的羊粪已经有两千万斤。最近，山西等省三十多个县又同这个旗的供销社订立合同，继续向牧民收购两千多万斤羊粪肥料。
    内蒙古牧区每年都积下大量羊粪，过去因为交通不便，没有充分利用。1956年由火车外运后，出售羊粪就成了牧民的一项重要副业收入。如察哈尔右翼后旗牧民1956年卖羊粪的收入达十八万多元。据得到羊粪供应的山西省一些汉族农民反映，这种肥料价格低，肥效大，对他们1956年的农业增产起了作用。　（新华社）
    “人人积肥，户户沤凼”
    湘乡县掀起积肥热潮
    湖南省湘乡县的冬季积肥工作已经形成运动。全县七百五十四个农业社，每天出动七万多人，目前已积肥一千七百多万担。
    各社在11月底12月初，了解积肥状况，发现离今年生产的需要还差得很远。如金石乡西林社还差三分之二；这个社的社主任立即召开管委会找出八种肥源，订出积肥计划，并把积肥任务分配到队；然后，各队把任务按劳力、人口分配到户。12月3日，全社二百多个男女劳动力全部投入积肥热潮，第一天就挑了一万二千多担塘泥。
    一些乡、社还开展了积肥竞赛。梅桥乡先进社社员们提出了“人人积肥、户户沤凼”的口号，三天积肥四万担。莲花乡盐井社社员们在竞赛中，把一千八百多条田塍都铲光了，还把荒坪上的草皮刨起来，把山上的树叶扫起来，做到了“全社遍地无（丛生）杂草，丘丘田里有粪凼”；而且，已经沤的三千九百多个凼子都翻了一遍。
