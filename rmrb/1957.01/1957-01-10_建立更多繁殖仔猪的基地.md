Establish More Bases for Breeding Piglets

Lechang and other places have good pig breeds for development

The pig breeding production in the famous high-quality pig breed producing areas of Guangdong Province, such as the Meihua District of Lechang County and the Lantang District of Zijin County, is rapidly recovering and developing. There are currently more than 19,000 pigs in Meihua District, Lechang County, with an average of 2.4 pigs per household, an increase of nearly 60% compared to 1955. Among them, the number of sows has increased by more than 14,000 compared to the first half of last year, breaking the historical record for the number of sows raised in this district. There are currently more than 3,600 sows in Lantang District, Zijin County, exceeding the 1956 increase target by 1.2%.

The development of pig breeding production in these high-quality pig breeding bases further meets the needs of pig breeds in various parts of the province. Since the second half of last year, Meihua District, Lechang County, has transferred more than 6,550 breeding pigs to other places. Wenchang, Changsa, and Wengtian, the three pig-producing areas of Wenchang County, are now vigorously carrying out the movement of "one sow per household, one large pig per two households."

Changzhi Area Universally Establishes Sow Stations

In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient pig sources, Changzhi Area of Shanxi Province has universally established sow stations, either by township or by agricultural production cooperative. The sow stations are also equipped with an appropriate number of boars. The piglets bred here are supplied to the entire township or cooperative. Most of the townships in the area now have a sow station. Thirty-five townships in Wuxiang County have achieved sow stations in every township. Because of the large number of piglets bred, the number of pigs raised in the area last year increased by 47% compared to the previous year.

One year of practice has proven that the universal establishment of sow stations has many advantages. First, it can solve the problem of pig sources. Before Wuxiang County established sow stations the year before last, only 3,500 piglets were bred. It is estimated that the thirty-five sow stations in the county can breed 35,000 piglets this spring. At that time, the county's pig breeding volume will increase fivefold compared to last year. If a region achieves self-breeding and self-raising, it is no longer necessary to purchase piglets from other places, which can also prevent the spread of swine fever. Establishing sow stations to breed a large number of piglets can also increase the sideline income of agricultural cooperatives and members. The sow station of the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Hexi Township, Gaoping County, raises 69 sows. Members can buy a piglet for 1.5 yuan (the outside price is 6 yuan). Raising it to a semi-grown pig can generate an income of 15 to 20 yuan. The cooperative can then raise it into a fattened pig, which can generate an income of about 15 yuan. Last year, the cooperative and its members earned a total of more than 6,400 yuan, with an average income of 14 yuan per household, which solved the problem of pocket money.

The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that the method of establishing sow stations in agricultural production cooperatives is a good way to vigorously develop pig breeding on the basis of cooperation and has decided to promote it throughout the province starting this year.

Rongchang and Neijiang Supply Large Quantities of High-Quality Piglets

Rongchang and Neijiang counties, the supply bases of high-quality piglets in Sichuan Province, transferred more than 80,000 piglets to other provinces and regions, including Tibet and Hubei, last year. This year, the two counties plan to supply more than 450,000 piglets, and the supply area will also be expanded.

The "White Pig" of Rongchang County and the "Black Pig" of Neijiang County are both famous pig breeds. These pigs grow quickly, grow large, have strong reproductive capabilities, and have particularly excellent pig bristles. Last year, the party and government leading organs of the two counties regarded mobilizing and helping farmers develop piglets as an important task. The number of sows in the two counties increased rapidly. There are currently more than 42,000 sows in Rongchang County, an average of one sow for every two households, creating the highest record for the number of sows raised in the county. In February last year, there were only 8,000 sows in Neijiang County, which developed to more than 28,000 by the end of the year, an average of one sow for every four households. At the same time, the two counties have correspondingly developed boars and established breeding stations with a focus. Due to the widespread implementation of double breeding and continuous breeding methods, the farrowing rate of sows has been improved.

This year, in addition to continuing to develop piglets in large quantities, the two counties are also preparing to implement variety identification and other work to improve the quality of piglets. (Xinhua News Agency)

    建立更多繁殖仔猪的基地
    乐昌等地优良猪种有发展
    广东省著名的优良猪种产区——乐昌县梅花区、紫金县蓝塘区等地的养猪生产，正在迅速恢复和发展。乐昌县梅花区现有生猪一万九千多头，平均每户养猪二点四头，比1955年增加近六成。其中母猪比去年上半年增加一万四千多头，突破这个区历史上饲养母猪数量的最高纪录。紫金县蓝塘区现有母猪三千六百多头，超额完成1956年增养任务1.2％。
    这些优良种猪基地养猪生产的发展，进一步满足了省内各地猪种的需要。乐昌县梅花区在去年下半年以来，已有六千五百五十多头猪种外调；文昌县文教、昌洒、翁田三个产猪区，现在正大力开展“一户一母猪，二户一大猪”运动。

    长治地区普遍建立母猪站
    山西省长治地区为了解决猪源不足的困难，普遍以乡或以农业生产合作社为单位建立了母猪站。母猪站里还备有适当数量的公猪。这里繁殖的仔猪供应全乡或全社。现在全区大部分的乡都有了一个母猪站。武乡县三十五个乡，已经做到乡乡都有母猪站。因为小猪繁殖的多，去年全区养猪头数比前年增加了47％。
    经过一年的实践证明，普遍建立母猪站的好处很多，首先是可以解决猪源问题。武乡县前年没有建立母猪站的时候，只繁殖小猪三千五百头，估计全县三十五个母猪站到今春可繁殖小猪三万五千头，那时全县养猪量将比去年增加五倍。一个地区做到自繁自养，不必再从外地购买小猪，这样又可以防止猪瘟疫的传染。建立母猪站大量繁殖小猪，还能增加农业社和社员的副业收入。高平县河西乡前进农业社的母猪站养母猪六十九头。社员用一元五角就可以买到一头小猪（外面的价格是六元一头），养成架子猪可收入十五元至二十元，社里再把它养成肥猪，又可以收入十五元左右。去年社和社员共收入六千四百多元，每户平均收入十四元，解决了零花钱的困难。
    中共山西省委认为在农业生产合作社建立母猪站的办法，是在合作化基础上大力发展养猪事业的一个好办法，决定从今年起，在全省范围内推广。　（白兴华）
    荣昌、内江大批供应良种仔猪
    四川省良种仔猪的供应基地荣昌和内江两县，去年共有八万多只仔猪调往省内外，包括西藏、湖北等地区。今年两县计划供应仔猪四十五万只以上，供应地区也将要扩大。
    荣昌县的“白猪”和内江县的“黑猪”，都是著名的猪种。这些猪长得快，长得大，繁殖力强，猪鬃质量特别优良。去年两县党、政领导机关把发动和帮助农民发展仔猪，作为一项重要的工作。两县母猪迅速增加。荣昌县现有母猪四万二千多只，平均每两户就有一只，创造了这个县饲养母猪数量的最高纪录。内江县去年2月份只有母猪八千只，到年底发展到了两万八千多只，平均每四户一只。同时，两县相应地发展了公猪，有重点地建立了配种站。由于普遍推行双重配种和连续配种的方法，提高了母猪的产仔率。
    今年两县除了继续大量发展仔猪以外，还准备实行品种鉴定等工作，提高仔猪的质量。（新华社）
