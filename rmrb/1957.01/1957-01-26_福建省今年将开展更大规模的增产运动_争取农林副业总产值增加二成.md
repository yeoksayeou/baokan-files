Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, January 23rd: This year, Fujian Province will launch a production increase movement on an even larger scale than in 1956. This decision was made at the recently concluded enlarged meeting of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The meeting called on the entire party and the broad masses of peasants in Fujian to mobilize and strive to increase the total output value of agriculture, forestry, and sideline production by 20% compared to last year. If this plan can be realized, the income of each farming household in the province will increase by approximately 68 yuan compared to last year.

Last year, although Fujian Province suffered continuous and severe disasters such as floods, droughts, winds, and pests, thanks to the basis of cooperativization, grain production was still able to complete the plan of 9 billion jin, an increase of 16% compared to 1955. Production in other areas also saw greater increases than in previous years. The meeting believes that Fujian, located in the subtropical zone, has very broad avenues for agricultural production and great potential. In addition to grain, the conditions for production in forestry, fishery, cash crops, orchards, tea, animal husbandry, and other aspects are very good. As long as leadership is strengthened, the work of consolidating agricultural production cooperatives is well done, and the policy of taking grain as the main focus while comprehensively developing production continues to be implemented, there is full confidence in achieving even greater victories in agricultural production in the second year after agricultural cooperativization.

The meeting pointed out that carrying out the production increase movement mainly relies on the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of cooperative members, and emphasized doing a good job in consolidating cooperatives. The basic requirements for consolidating cooperatives are to implement the two main principles of "equal pay for equal work" (i.e., the distribution issue of remuneration according to labor) and "sharing weal and woe" between cooperative cadres and members (i.e., the issue of close cadre-mass relations). In order to correct the shortcomings of the past in agricultural production plans, where certain production measures for agricultural cooperatives were stipulated too strictly and rigidly, mechanically stipulating crop planting requirements regardless of local conditions at the time, the meeting decided that in future production plans, local areas should be able to adapt to local conditions under the unified national plan, giving agricultural cooperatives a certain degree of flexibility. The state's production plan targets and procurement tasks should be simultaneously communicated to the cooperatives. Agricultural cooperatives and peasants can refer to the production plan targets proposed by the state and, combined with the situation of their own cooperatives, arrange their own production plans. What to plant and how much to plant are all determined by themselves. However, the state-allocated procurement tasks for various products must be guaranteed to be completed. In this way, cooperatives and peasants can have a clear understanding, making it easier to plan and arrange their own production according to their own needs and possibilities, and it can also guarantee the balance of the state plan. The province's requirements for each county should also be handled in accordance with this principle.

The enlarged meeting decided to carry out a rectification movement among cadres at all levels this year, and pointed out that this is an important guarantee for improving the relationship between cadres and the masses, consolidating cooperatives, and carrying out the production increase and thrift movement. The meeting also studied the methods of rectification and made some provisions.

The meeting also studied and arranged for the experimental work of streamlining and economizing, adjusting cooperative organization, and adjusting rural wage policies.

### 福建省今年将开展更大规模的增产运动  争取农林副业总产值增加二成

    福建省今年将开展更大规模的增产运动
    争取农林副业总产值增加二成
    新华社福州23日电　今年，福建省要开展一个比1956年规模更大的增产运动。这项决定是最近闭幕的中共福建省委扩大会议作出的。会议号召福建全党和广大农民动员起来，为争取今年农业、林业和副业生产的总产值共计比去年增加二成而斗争。这个计划如能实现，全省每一农户将比去年增加收入六十八元左右。
    去年福建省虽然连续遭受到水、旱、风、虫等严重灾害，但在合作化的基础上，粮食生产仍能完成九十亿斤的计划，比1955年增产16％，其他各方面的生产也都有较往年为多的增产。会议认为位居亚热带的福建，农业生产的门路十分广阔，潜力很大，除粮食外，林业、渔业、经济作物、果林、茶叶、牧畜业等多方面的生产条件是很好的，只要加强领导，做好对农业生产合作社的巩固工作，并继续贯彻以粮食为主全面发展生产的方针，完全有信心取得农业合作化以后第二个年度农业生产上的更大胜利。
    会议指出开展增产运动主要依靠广大社员的生产积极性。并强调做好巩固合作社的工作。巩固合作社的基本要求是贯彻“同工同酬”（即按劳取酬的分配问题）及社干部和社员“同甘共苦”（即密切干群关系问题）的两个主要原则。为了纠正过去在农业生产计划上对农业社某些生产措施规定得太严太死，不顾当时当地条件机械地规定作物种植要求的缺点，会议决定在今后生产计划上应在国家统一计划下使地方能因地制宜，给农业社一定的机动权利。国家的生产计划指标以及收购任务，要同时下达到合作社。农业社和农民可以参照国家提出的生产计划指标和结合本社的情况，安排自己的生产计划。要种什么，种多少，都由他们自己确定。但国家所分配的各项产品的征购任务，必须保证完成。这样既可使合作社和农民心中有数，便于按照自己的需要和可能计划安排自己的生产，也可以保证国家计划的平衡。省里对各县要求也按照这个原则办理。
    扩大会议决定今年要在各级干部中开展整风运动，并指出这是当前改善干部和群众的关系，巩固合作社和开展增产节约运动的重要保证。会议还研究了整风的方法，并做了若干规定。
    会议对精简节约，调整合作社组织，调整农村工资政策的试验工作也作了研究和安排。
