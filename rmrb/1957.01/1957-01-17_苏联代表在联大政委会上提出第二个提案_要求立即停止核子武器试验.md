Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th - The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee held a meeting on the 15th to continue discussing disarmament issues. The Soviet representative at the meeting presented a second proposal demanding that countries conducting atomic and hydrogen weapons tests immediately cease such tests.

British representative Noble spoke, stating that Britain would sympathetically consider the five points proposed by U.S. representative Lodge at the meeting on the 14th. According to Noble, an agreement had been reached on the issue of the level of armed forces of major powers, as both the Soviet Union and Western countries had suggested limiting the armies of the Soviet Union and the United States to 2.5 million, and the armies of France and Britain to 750,000. Regarding the U.S. proposal for international supervision of missiles, Noble advocated similar supervision of long-range submarines and long-range aircraft.

Noble put forward three British suggestions on the disarmament issue: the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee should give priority to discussing international supervision and inspection; research should be conducted quickly on supervising missiles and other selected weapons; and investigations should be conducted on the issue of nuclear weapon test explosions to determine whether it is possible to reach a separate agreement on limiting such tests.

However, Noble avoided discussing the immediate prohibition of the production and use of nuclear weapons and the cessation of testing such weapons. Like the U.S. representative, the basic emphasis of his speech was not on practical steps for disarmament, but only on stressing the need to first resolve the issue of inspection and supervision.

Belgian representative Langehove then spoke in support of the U.S. plan.

Indian representative Menon requested that the representatives of the five countries participating in the Disarmament Subcommittee be allowed to speak first in order to determine whether their opinions were the same. However, as the French and Canadian representatives participating in the Subcommittee indicated that they were not prepared to speak at that day's meeting, the meeting decided to adjourn temporarily and reconvene on the 16th.

Sources say that the United States and the countries supporting it hope to end the general discussion on the disarmament issue in the General Assembly as soon as possible. Although they have put forward several suggestions, they are unwilling to publicly discuss the actual steps to be taken for disarmament in the General Assembly.

    苏联代表在联大政委会上提出第二个提案
    要求立即停止核子武器试验
    新华社16日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会15日举行会议，继续讨论裁军问题。苏联代表在会上提出了第二个提案，要求进行原子武器和氢武器试验的国家立即停止这种试验。
    英国代表诺布尔发言，表示英国将同情地考虑美国代表洛奇在14日会议上提出的五点建议。照诺布尔说，在大国武装部队水平的问题上，由于苏联和西方国家都建议把苏联和美国的军队限于二百五十万人，法国和英国的军队限于七十五万人，双方已经达成了协议。谈到美国建议的对导弹实行国际监督时，诺布尔主张同时对远程潜水艇和远程飞机进行类似的监督。
    诺布尔提出了英国对于裁军问题的三点建议：联合国裁军小组委员会优先讨论国际监督和视察问题；赶紧研究监督导弹和其他选定的武器的问题；对核子武器试验性爆炸问题进行调查研究，以确定是否能够就限制这种试验单独达成协议。
    但是，诺布尔避而不谈立即禁止生产和使用核子武器以及停止试验这类武器的问题。和美国代表一样，他的发言的基本着重点不是放在裁军的实际步骤上，而只是强调首先要解决视察和监督问题。
    比利时代表兰根霍夫接着发言支持美国计划。
    印度代表梅农要求先让参加裁军小组委员会的五个国家的代表发言，以判别它们的意见是否一样。但是，由于参加小组委员会的法国和加拿大代表表示不准备在这一天会议上发言，会议决定暂时休会，到16日再开。
    有消息说，美国和支持它的国家希望尽快在大会上结束对裁军问题的一般讨论。它们虽然提出几点建议，但是并不愿意在大会上公开讨论采取裁军的实际步骤问题。
