Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 5th: According to a report by the Hungarian News Agency, after the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party's organ "People's Freedom" recently published in full the important theoretical article "Once Again on the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" from the Chinese "People's Daily," it published a lengthy commentary on January 4th titled "On Two Kinds of Contradictions."

"People's Freedom" wrote: "This newspaper article from China explores in a new way some issues that have been hotly debated in the international communist movement for a long time. This will certainly help to arrive at objective truth in the debate."

After briefly describing the main points of the "People's Daily" article, the newspaper wrote: "Now, we would like to emphasize only one of the issues – the issue of contradictions of different natures. We urge everyone to pay attention to this issue, because this kind of theoretical analysis can greatly help us understand the Hungarian events and draw correct lessons from these events."

The article described and commented on the theory of two major contradictions and contradictions among the people, and then emphasized: "No matter how complex the task of carefully analyzing the (Hungarian) October 23rd events may be, the fact remains that those who seek objective truth cannot deny that the point we quoted above is applicable to the essence of the Hungarian events. In fact, in addition to the antagonistic contradiction between us and our external enemies, there are also contradictions among the people at home. As a result, many people have forgotten the fundamental contradiction between the people's democratic system and imperialism, which constitutes the main contradiction. Therefore, after October 23rd, there were many honest and well-intentioned people in Budapest who took up arms against the policies that were being spurned, forgetting that by doing so they were endangering the existence of the people's democratic order and the workers' regime.

The article went on to say: As for those bourgeois elements who initially participated in the events under the banner of socialist democracy, they gradually abandoned their masks. This shows that the counter-revolutionary forces wanted to seize power, so the issue was no longer a contradiction among the people, but an acute antagonistic contradiction between us and the enemy.

The article concluded: "Unfortunately, there are still many among us who have not seen things so clearly. We believe that this expression of attitude by China, even if it has not convinced everyone, will cause many people to reflect deeply. This expression of attitude will also encourage everyone to measure the tragic events of the recent past in a new way."

    匈牙利“人民自由报”发表专文
    评论“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”
    认为文内关于不同性质的矛盾的问题，有助于理解匈牙利事件；10月23日之后，在布达佩斯就有很多正直和善意的人手执武器反对被人们唾弃的政策，而忘记了他们这样作就危害人民民主秩序和工人政权的存在。
    新华社布达佩斯5日电　据匈牙利通讯社报道：匈牙利社会主义工人党机关报“人民自由报”在最近全文刊载了中国“人民日报”那篇重要的理论性文章“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”以后，1月4日以“论两种矛盾”为题发表了评论这篇文章的长文。
      “人民自由报”写道：“中国这家日报的文章以新的方式探讨很久以来就在国际共产主义运动中展开热烈讨论的一些问题。这当然将有助于在争论中得出客观的真理。”
    报纸在扼要叙述了“人民日报”文章中的主要论点之后写道：“现在，我们愿意只强调指出其中一个问题——关于不同性质的矛盾的问题。我们促请大家注意这个问题，因为这种理论性分析能够大大有助于我们理解匈牙利事件并从这些事件中吸取正确的教训。”
    文章叙述和评论了关于两个主要矛盾以及人民内部矛盾的理论，然后强调指出：“不管对（匈牙利）10月23日事件进行仔细分析的任务多么复杂，但是事实仍然是：探求客观真理的人们不能否认我们上面所引述的这个论点对匈牙利事件的本质是适用的。事实上，除掉我们同我们的外部敌人之间的对抗性矛盾以外，在国内还存在着人民内部的矛盾。结果是很多人忘记了构成主要矛盾的人民民主制度和帝国主义之间的根本矛盾。因此，在10月23日之后在布达佩斯就有很多正直和善意的人手执武器反对被人们唾弃的政策，而忘记了他们这样作就危害人民民主秩序和工人政权的存在。
    文章接着说：至于在开始时以社会主义民主主义的口号参加事件的那些资产阶级分子，他们逐渐抛下了假面具。由此可见，反革命势力要夺取政权，因此问题不再是人民内部的一种矛盾，而是我们和敌人之间的一种尖锐的对抗性矛盾。
    文章最后说：“不幸，在我们之间仍然有很多人没有这样清楚地看清事物。我们认为中国的这种表明态度，即使还没有说服所有的人，却将使很多人深思熟虑一番。这种表明态度也将鼓励大家用新的方式来衡量不久之前的悲惨事件。”
