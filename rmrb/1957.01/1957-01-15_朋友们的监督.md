    Supervision from Friends
    Zhong Xun
    The United Front Work Inspection Group of the Taiyuan City Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) was jointly formed by the Taiyuan City Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), the China Democratic League (CDL), the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA), the Overseas Chinese Federation, and religious circles at the suggestion of the Taiyuan City Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The inspection group's activities began in mid-November 1956 and ended in early December. During the twenty days, they went deep into factories, government offices, schools, churches, and temples, contacted a wide range of people, and helped the Party and the government discover and solve many problems. This further strengthened the unity between the Party and the masses, and between the Party and the democratic parties.
    In early December, the United Front Work Inspection Group reported separately to the Municipal CPPCC. The reports showed that CPPCC members going deep into the grassroots, understanding the situation, discovering problems, and solving problems is of great significance for giving play to the democratic parties' role in supervising the Communist Party and for enhancing internal unity among the people. For example, the RCCK inspection group learned from the General Office of the Municipal People's Committee, the Municipal Bureau of Justice, and other units that the Party committees and leading cadres of these agencies had the shortcoming of providing more help to democratic party members in their work but less help in their thinking. They then personally exchanged opinions with the responsible persons of the Party committees of these agencies, which aroused the attention of the leaders of these units. Another example is the CNDCA inspection group, which, in nearly twenty days, not only earnestly followed the principles of adjusting public-private relations, promoting unity, and benefiting production, and inspected the United Front work of six joint public-private enterprises, but also strove to solve problems on the spot whenever they were discovered. For example, when the inspection group inspected the work of the joint public-private vehicle repair factory, they found that some private personnel were improperly assigned. Some of these people originally operated silk and cloth businesses, some worked in shoe material shops, and some had technologies such as copper and aluminum smelting, which were inconvenient for them to utilize here. After discovering this problem, the inspection group immediately studied it with the Party branch负责人 of the factory, and the Party branch adopted the inspection group's opinion and decided to apply to the Municipal Bureau of Industry and the Personnel Bureau to appropriately adjust the work of these individuals. And the discovery and solution of the problem of the Municipal No. 4 Middle School by the CDL inspection group is another more concrete and vivid example. According to Li Jisheng, deputy director of the CDL, he originally heard from CDL members in No. 4 Middle School that the relationship between Party members and CDL members in this school was relatively normal. However, after this inspection, he believed that there was a phenomenon of superficial harmony but actual discord here. This phenomenon was concentrated in the fact that the majority of teachers and staff had many opinions on the leadership style of Deputy Principal Liu Dongshan (a Party member). For example, Wei Mingting (a CDL member), the director of teaching affairs, said: "Compared with the Party cadres in other schools, Liu Dongshan treats people as different as summer and spring winds." The majority of teachers and staff said that his style was rigid and he was subjective in handling affairs. Some people also said that he lost his temper and lectured people at the New Year's tea party last year. However, the inspection group did not immediately confirm that these opinions were all correct. They solicited opinions from many parties and had a detailed conversation with Liu Huawen, deputy secretary of the school's Party branch. After the inspection group conducted a comprehensive study and comprehensive analysis of the situation, they directly talked to Liu Dongshan individually.
    How did Liu Dongshan evaluate the situation of the school? The inspection group believed that from a subjective point of view, he really wanted to improve the unity of the school. For example, he once expressed to the higher-level Party organization: "There are few Party members in No. 4 Middle School, and CDL members should be cultivated and used like Party members." And he really tried to do so. For example, of the eleven CDL members in No. 4 Middle School, nine were absorbed by the Party branch to listen to Party lectures. Whenever the CDL branch invited him to attend meetings, he tried to find time to attend. However, because Liu Dongshan focused too much on the good aspects of what he had done and ignored his own shortcomings, and because he heard a few good words of flattery from individual unhealthy people, he became unclear-headed. Under the control of this complacency, he often believed in himself too much and could not more humbly listen to the opinions of the masses. Faced with this situation, the friends of the CDL, in the spirit of being responsible for their work, truthfully reflected the opinions raised by the masses to him, and made serious criticisms to him, sounding the alarm that he must change his style. This sincere and serious criticism greatly helped Liu Dongshan face up to his shortcomings and some mistakes, and with the help of the school's Party branch, he publicly made a sincere review and a deeper self-criticism to the teachers and staff. He also said that he must change his style and improve unity in the future. Not only that, but the inspection group also helped the CDL members here criticize and clarify some confused ideas, such as confusing today's democracy with the old democracy, belittling the role of the CDL, and lacking a sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs.
    Summarizing the above examples, we can clearly see how important the supervision of our friends is to our Party, and this fact also powerfully illustrates how wise and correct the Party's policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" is.

    朋友们的监督
    钟迅
    政协太原市委员会统战工作检查团，是由中共太原市委会提议、由太原市民革、民盟、民建、侨联和宗教界等联合组成的，检查团的活动，从1956年11月中旬开始，到12月初结束，他们在历时二十天的时间里，深入工厂、机关、学校、教堂和寺院，联系了广泛的群众，帮助党和政府发现和解决了许多问题。从而进一步加强了党与群众、党与民主党派之间的团结。
    统战工作检查团，在12月初旬，分头向市政协做了汇报。从汇报的情况表明，政协委员深入下层，了解情况，发现问题，解决问题，这对发挥民主党派对共产党的监督作用，对增强人民内部的团结来说，是有重要意义的。例如，民革检查组，曾在市人民委员会办公厅、市司法局等单位了解到，这些机关的党委和领导干部，对民主党派成员有工作上帮助多、思想上帮助少的缺点之后，就亲自找这些机关的党委负责人交换意见，从而引起了这些单位领导干部的注意。又如民建检查组，在将近二十天的时间里，不仅认真的遵循着调整公私关系，搞好团结，以利生产的原则，对六个公私合营企业的统战工作情况做了检查，而且做到了随时发现问题，就力求就地解决。例如检查组在公私合营车具修造厂检查工作时，发现有些私方人员安排不当，这些人有的原经营绸布业，有的干鞋料庄，有的具有炼铜、铝等技术，在这里都不便发挥他们的作用。检查组发现这个问题以后，就立即和这个厂的党支部负责人做了研究，党支部并采纳了检查组的意见，决定向市工业局和人事局申请，来适当调整这几个人的工作。而民盟检查组，对市立第四中学问题的发现和解决，又是一个更具体生动的例子。据民盟副主任委员李济生说，原来他听到四中盟员们的反映，还说这个学校的党员和盟员的关系是比较正常的。可是经过这次检查，他认为这里是存有着貌合神离的现象的。这种现象，集中反映在多数的教职员，对刘东山副校长（党员）的领导作风有很多意见。如教导主任魏明亭（盟员）说：“刘东山待人和别的学校的党员干部比较起来，犹如夏日和春风的不同。”多数教职员说他作风生硬，办事主观。有人还说，在去年的新年团拜会上他还发脾气训人。但是，检查组并没有立刻证实这些意见都是正确的，他们从多方面征求了意见，并和学校党支部副书记刘化文做了详细的交谈，待检查组把情况做了全面研究和综合分析以后，才直接找刘东山做个别谈话。
    刘东山是怎样估计学校的情况呢，检查组认为，从主观愿望上看，他真是想把学校的团结搞好的。例如，他曾向上级党组织表示过：“四中的党员少，对待盟员应像对待党员那样培养和使用。而且他真的努力这样做了。如四中十一个盟员，就有九人被党支部吸收听党课。每逢盟的支部开会邀请他时，他都尽量抽出时间来去列席参加。但是，由于刘东山偏重的看到了自己做的好的方面，而忽视了自己还存在的缺点，加上再听到个别思想不健康的人奉承过他几句好话，就使自己的头脑也不清醒起来。在这种自满情绪支配下面，许多时候，就过多的相信了自己，而不能更虚心的听取群众的意见。面对着这种情况，民盟的朋友们以对工作负责的精神，把群众提出的意见，如实地反映给他，并向他提出了严正的批评，向他敲起了必须转变作风的警钟。这种诚恳严肃的批评，极大地帮助了刘东山正视自己的缺点和某些错误，他并在学校党支部的帮助下，公开的向教职员们做了诚恳的检讨和较深刻的自我批评。并且表示，今后一定要转变作风，搞好团结。不仅这样，检查组还帮助这里的盟员批判和澄清了一些糊涂观念，如把今天的民主和旧民主混为一谈，轻视盟的作用，缺乏主人翁的工作态度等等。
    综合以上事例，使我们可以清楚看到，朋友们的监督，对于我们党是具有多么重要的意义，而这事实也有力地说明，党所提出的“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，是多么英明正确。
