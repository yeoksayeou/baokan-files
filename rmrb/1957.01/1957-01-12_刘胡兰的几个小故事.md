A Few Short Stories About Liu Hulan
　　Teng Mingdao Han Jianmin

　　Little Sentry

　　Not long after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the reactionaries everywhere plundered the people's fruits of victory. The Yan bandits in Pingchuan, Jinzhong, sent a large number of troops to attack the people, claiming to "flood Pingchuan."

　　One autumn night in 1946, a team of more than fifty people came to the village. Liu Hulan heard that a team had come to the village and quickly ran to take a look. It turned out to be Old Han and his comrades from the county. Hulanzi happily said, "It's you! Just stay in our village!" Old Han quietly asked, "The Gouzi troops are only five miles to the west. Is it alright to stay here?" "Don't worry! I'll keep watch for you," Hulanzi guaranteed. Old Han smiled and said, "You're just a little girl, and the enemy is so close, and it's cold at night. No need." Hulan refused to accept this, saying, "Hey, don't look down on me because I'm young, I still have some courage. Even if the enemy comes, they won't pay attention to me."

　　That night, Hulan and four sentries secretly climbed under the embankment on the west side of the village. At the slightest movement, she would nudge the sentry next to her and gently say, "Comrade! Listen, what's that sound!"

　　At the fifth watch, the team set off, but Hulanzi was still standing there, eyes wide open.

　　Why Refused to Learn to Read?

　　When Hulanzi was little, one day she came home from school, and angrily said to her mother: "I'm not going to school anymore!" "Why?" "The children of rich families, without even asking, the teacher teaches them. When we ask, they hardly pay attention to us." "Then what are you going to do?" "I'll learn from you at home, teach me a few words a day, and I'm sure I can learn them." From then on, Hulan stopped going to school. Her mother taught her three words every day with paper blocks, and she learned while spinning cotton.

　　One day, her mother found that she had thrown these square word blocks everywhere and asked her, "What are you doing? If you want to learn, learn properly?" "The words you teach are useless." "What words do you want to learn?" "Write 'Eighth Route Army', 'Anti-Japanese Government' for me, and see if I can recognize them!"

　　Yunzhou West Village was an anti-Japanese guerrilla area. The Eighth Route Army and comrades working in the county often came to this village. Liu Hulan heard many revolutionary principles and stories from them. She wanted to learn from the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army.

　　"It All Depends on You Two"

　　In the late autumn of 1945, Hulan, along with Jin Xian and Fang Ze from the village, was training at the Nanbaizhuang Women's Cadre Training Class. When they first arrived, they were not used to the life, and some people were very uneasy.

　　One day at noon, just after class, Fang Ze said to Jin Xian in the toilet: "Hmph! What's the point of this? When we came, they said it was so good, but it's not as good as being at home, let's go back!" Hulan heard this. That night, Hulan found Fang Ze and Jin Xian and asked, "You want to go back?" "Yeah." "Why?" "It's unbearably hard." Hulan said, "It's only a few days in total, and you can't stand this hardship. How will you work in the future! I'm not going back, it all depends on you two!" Jin Xian and Fang Ze felt very embarrassed when they heard this and lowered their heads without saying a word. From then on, they never mentioned going home again.

　　Scored a Hundred Points

　　Hulan studied very hard. If there was anything she didn't understand, she would ask others. Even if she didn't recognize a single word, she wouldn't easily let it go. Once after class, she and several comrades were looking at the slogans on the wall in the classroom. One of them read: "Comrades, we must attach importance to learning." Hulan didn't recognize the words "attach importance," so she asked Yu Lan, who was standing next to her. Yu Lan said, "I don't recognize them either."

　　"Let's go ask the homeroom teacher!"

　　Some comrades said, "What's the hurry, let's put it aside for now, and ask the group leader when we report at night."

　　"No, let's go ask now."

　　As she spoke, Hulan ran to the homeroom teacher and finally figured out the word "attach importance."

　　During the term exam, she scored a hundred points.

    刘胡兰的几个小故事
    滕明道　韩健民
    小哨兵
    抗日战争胜利不久，反动派到处抢夺人民的胜利果实。阎匪在晋中平川，派了大批军队向人民进攻，扬言要“水漫平川”。
    1946年秋天的一个夜晚，村里来了一支五十多人的队伍。刘胡兰听说村上来了队伍，赶紧跑去一看，原来是县上老韩他们。胡兰子高兴地说：“原来是你们呀，就住在咱村吧！”老韩悄悄地问：“西面五里地就是勾子军，住这里不要紧吧！”“你们歇心吧！有我给你们放哨。”胡兰子保证说。老韩笑了笑说：“你还是个小女子，敌人离得这么近，夜里又冷，不用了。”胡兰不服气地说：“嘿，别看我年纪小，倒有点勇气，他敌人来了，也不注意我。”
    这夜，胡兰和四个哨兵，偷偷地爬在村西头的地堰下面。一有点动静，他就推推旁边的哨兵，轻轻地说：“同志！你听，是啥响哩！”
    五更时分，队伍出发了，胡兰子还是一眼不眨地站在那里。
    为什么不肯认字？
    胡兰子小的时候，有一天从学校回家，气嚷嚷地对妈说：“我不上学啦！”“为什么？”“人家有钱孩子，不用问，先生就教，咱问，人家还带理不理。”“那你打算咋办？”“我在家跟你学，一天教我几个字，准能认下。”打这以后，胡兰就不上学了。妈妈每天用纸块教三个字，她一面纺花一面学。
    这天，妈妈发现她把这些方字块扔的到处都是，问她：“你这作甚里？要学不好好学？”“你教的这些字没用。”“你要学甚字哩？”“你给我写‘八路军’、‘抗日政府’，看我认不认？”
    云周西村是个抗日游击地区。八路军和县上工作的同志，常上这村来。刘胡兰从他们那听到许多革命道理和故事。她要学习共产党和八路军。
    “就看你俩啦”
    1945年秋末，胡兰跟村上的金仙、芳则在南白庄妇女干部训练班受训，刚去的时候，生活过不惯，有些人很不安心。
    这天晌午，刚上罢课，芳则在厕所里对金仙说：“哼！这是作甚里，来的时候说的这好，那好，还不抵在家里，咱回吧！”这话被胡兰知道了。晚上，胡兰找到芳则和金仙，问：“你们想回啦？”“嗯”“为什么？”“苦的不行。”胡兰说：“统共也没几天，这些苦就受不住，往后怎么工作！我是不回，就看你俩啦！”金仙和芳则听了很不好意思，低下头说不出话来。打这以后，再也不提回家的事了。
    考了一百分
    胡兰学习很努力，有不懂的地方就问旁人，那怕是一个字不认识，她也不轻易放过。有一回下了课，她跟几个同志在课堂看墙上的标语，有一张上面这样写着“同志们，我们要重视学习。”胡兰不认得“重视”两字，就问站在她身边的玉兰，玉兰说：“咱也不认得。”
    “走，咱们去问问班主任吧！”
    有的同志说：“忙什么，先搁下吧，到夜里汇报的时候，问问组长算了。”
    “不，咱这就去问。”
    胡兰说着，就跑到班主任那儿，总算把“重视”这个字弄懂了。
    学期考试的时候，她考了一百分。
