Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th. Shanghai held a conference of grassroots trade union cadres attended by more than 14,000 people on the afternoon of the 15th. Zhang Qi, vice chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, proposed at the meeting that workers returning home for the Spring Festival this year should pay attention to achieving "seven musts" and "seven must nots."

He demanded that after returning home, workers must resolutely support the agricultural cooperation movement and not harm the peasants' enthusiasm for cooperation; they must encourage and help peasants to do a good job in agricultural production and not blindly bring relatives and friends to the city; they must abide by the laws and decrees of the local government and not disrupt local order; they must respect rural cadres and not one-sidedly criticize the shortcomings of rural cadres; they must take the initiative to unite with peasant brothers, humbly listen to peasants' opinions on industrial products, and not be arrogant; they must establish a hard-working and simple life style and not be extravagant and wasteful; they must be punctual in attendance and not be absent from work without reason. In short, when going to the countryside, they must say words that are beneficial to the worker-peasant alliance and do things that are beneficial to the worker-peasant alliance.

At the meeting, Yang Gufang, deputy director of the Shanghai Bureau Office of the CPC Central Committee, also introduced to the cadres present the current situation of rural work and the existing problems, so that everyone could have a correct understanding of the achievements of agricultural production and agricultural cooperation.

During the Spring Festival this year, in addition to organizing workers to have get-togethers with suburban peasants and inviting peasants to visit workers' cultural palaces and workers' clubs, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions also plans to organize more than 400 workers' representatives to visit and express sympathy to peasants in disaster areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui.

    上海市工会要求春节回乡工人
    注意巩固工农联盟
    新华社上海16日电　上海市在15日下午召开有一万四千多人参加的工会基层干部大会。市工会联合会副主席张祺在会上提出，今年春节回乡的工人应注意做到“七要”“七不要”。
    他要求工人回乡后，要坚决支持农业合作化运动，不要伤害农民的合作化积极性；要鼓励、帮助农民搞好农业生产，不要盲目把亲友带到城里来；要遵守当地政府的法令，不要破坏当地秩序；要尊重农村干部，不要片面批评农村干部的缺点；要主动团结农民兄弟，虚心倾听农民对工业产品的意见，不要骄傲自大；要树立艰苦朴素的生活作风，不要铺张浪费；要按时出勤，不要无故旷工。总之，到农村去要说有利于工农联盟的话，做有利于工农联盟的事。
    会上，中共中央上海局办公室副主任杨谷方还向到会干部介绍了当前农村工作的情况和存在的问题，使大家对农业生产和农业合作化的成就有一个正确的了解。
    今年春节期间，上海市工会联合会除了组织工人与郊区农民联欢，招待农民参观工人文化宫、工人俱乐部等活动以外，还准备组织四百多人的工人代表，分别前往江苏、浙江、安徽等地慰问灾区农民。
