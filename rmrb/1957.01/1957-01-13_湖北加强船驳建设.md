    Hubei Strengthens Ship and Barge Construction

    (Our Dispatch) To meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production development, the Hubei Provincial Inland Waterway Navigation Administration newly built and rebuilt more than 40 various types of ships and barges last year. Among the newly built ships and barges, there were Soviet jet-powered vessels, tugboats and barges, short-haul passenger and cargo ships, and small passenger liners, etc.

    These ships and barges were all designed according to the policy of "facing the inland rivers" and "developing the inland rivers." After these ships and barges were put into production, they played a considerable role in solving the contradiction between the large amount of cargo and the small transportation capacity on Hubei's inland rivers.

    湖北加强船驳建设
    本报讯　湖北省内河航运管理局，为了适应工农业生产发展的需要，去年新建和改建了各种船驳四十余艘。在新建的船驳中，有苏联喷水式船；有拖轮和驳船；有短航客货轮和小型客班轮等等。
    这些船驳，都是根据“面向内河”，“发展内河”的方针设计的，这些船驳投入生产后，对解决湖北内河货源多、运力小的矛盾起了相当大的作用。　（康国权）
