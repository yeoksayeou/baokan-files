    Snow
    Hou Dailin
    Snow is cold, but I love snow.
    I grew up experiencing cold seasons. I know that in cold seasons, it's just as cold without snow.
    Snow paves a crystal-clear road for the New Year, and the world after the snow is fresh and bright, a rare realm in the year. With snow, there are lush green wheat seedlings, and there will also be bright flowers. In the old society, it was not the snow that was hateful, but the darkness shrouded in the white snow. Think about it, how many Lin Chongs rushed to Liangshan on snowy nights? The dark days of the past are gone forever, and the delicate snowflakes shimmer with a pure white flame to the people.
    Children love snow the most. They make a snowball the size of a fist and roll it in the snow. After rolling it for a while, it becomes as big as a rice vat, and two or three children can't push it. They happily shout, "The lion is rolling an embroidered ball!" Children can also sweep the snow and pile it into a snowman, piling it high and big. "Look at the snowman's silly face!" They clap their hands and laugh. They can also pile up bears and New Year's old men. Ah! Piling up the New Year's old man means the Lunar New Year is coming. During the Lunar New Year, they can wear new clothes and shoes, and at night, carrying a vermilion lantern, they set off firecrackers on the snow, with loud bangs. Adults are not as stingy as they used to be, and they generously take out "lucky money" wrapped in red paper and distribute it to the children one by one. Although there is still snow on the roof, the inside and outside of the house are a blaze of red, completely bright. Who says snowy days are cold? Children just love snow.
    Innocent and pure children, stepping on the steps built by the New Year, gradually grow taller and bigger. They learn all kinds of labor from adults, and work tirelessly to protect peace. The wealth of labor harvested each year belongs to every child of different ages who has grown up in labor. The last scene of this natural calendar is the pure white snow. Let us write our new plans on the snow!

    雪
    侯岱麟
    雪是寒冷的，但是我爱雪。
    我是经历了寒冷的季节而长大的。我知道，在寒冷的季节里，没有雪也一样地寒冷。
    雪为新年铺下了晶莹的道路，雪后的世界清新明洁，这是一年里难得的境界；有了雪就有了绿油油的麦苗，也将会有鲜艳的花朵。在旧社会里，可恨的不是雪，而是那笼罩着白雪的阴暗。算一算，有多少个林冲在暴风雪的夜晚奔上梁山？旧日阴暗一去不复返了，娇怯的雪片，向人们闪烁着洁白的光焰。
    孩子们最喜欢雪了。团一只拳头般大的雪球，扔在雪地里滚，滚上半天，就有米瓮般大了，两三个孩子也推不动。他们愉快地喊道：“狮子滚绣球呀！”孩子们也可以把雪扫起来堆成雪人，堆得又高又大。“看，这个雪人的傻相！”他们拍着手笑了。他们也可以堆狗熊、堆新年老人。是啊！堆成新年老人就要过旧历年了。过旧历年可以穿新衣新鞋，夜里打着一盏朱红的灯笼，在雪地上燃放乒乒乓乓的爆竹，大人们也不像往日那样吝啬，都能慷慨地掏出用红纸包着的“压岁钱”，一一地分给孩子们。虽说房顶上还有积雪，而屋里屋外却是一片红火，彻底通明，谁说这有雪的日子寒冷？孩子们就喜欢雪。
    天真无邪的孩子们，踏着新年叠成的阶梯，渐渐长高了，长大了，他们从大人那里学会各式各样的劳动，为着保卫平安而不倦地工作着。每年收获的劳动财富，属于每一个在劳动中长成起来的，年龄不等的孩子们所有。这自然纪年历的最后一景，就是洁白的雪。让我们在雪上写出我们新的计划吧！
