    Cheng Zejia's Riveting Team
    On the construction site of the Lanzhou Refinery, there is a riveting team from Yumen Oil Mine led by Cheng Zejia. The team members are all young men. In the work of installing oil tanks, they learned advanced working methods from workers from East China and Northeast China, combined with their practical experience in Yumen Oil Mine, so they overfulfilled their tasks every month.

    成泽家铆工班
    在兰州炼油厂工地上，有一个来自玉门油矿的成泽家铆工班。这个班的人员都是年青小伙子。他们在安装油罐的工作中，向来自华东和东北的工人们学习先进的工作方法，结合他们在玉门油矿的实际经验，所以月月超额完成任务。
