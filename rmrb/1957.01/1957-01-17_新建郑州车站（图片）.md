    New Zhengzhou Railway Station
    Zhengzhou is the intersection of the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the Longhai Railway. In recent years, with the development of various construction projects, the passenger and freight transportation on these two railways has become increasingly busy, and the original Zhengzhou Railway Station has been unable to meet passenger transport needs. This is the newly built Zhengzhou Railway Station, which can accommodate more than 3,000 people and has now begun to receive passengers. Photo by Sha Sha (Contribution from Zhengzhou Daily)

    新建郑州车站
    郑州是京汉铁路和陇海铁路的交点，近几年来，随着各项建设事业的发展，这两条铁路的客货运输日益繁忙，原有的郑州车站，已经不能适应客运需要了。这是新建的郑州车站，它可容纳三千多人，现在已经开始接待旅客。　沙莎摄（郑州日报社稿）
