Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 25th: The Vietnam National Assembly passed a resolution on January 24th to improve the organization of the National Assembly. The resolution stipulates that before the Constitution is amended, the activities of the National Assembly, the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, and the National Assembly deputies will be strengthened first.

According to this resolution, by-elections will be held in North Vietnam this year to fill vacant seats; National Assembly deputies will strengthen their close ties with their constituents and the people in their residential areas in order to understand the people's situation and reflect the people's wishes to the National Assembly. Governments at all levels have the responsibility to help deputies understand the people's situation. In order to enable the deputies to work smoothly, deputies will be given a subsidy for activities.

The tasks and powers of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly have also been expanded compared to before. In the future, the temporary laws issued by the government, the appointment and removal of ministers, and the signing of treaties with foreign countries must first be approved by the Standing Committee before being submitted to the next National Assembly for approval. Members of the Standing Committee may not hold government positions concurrently.

The National Assembly will hold two sessions each year, and emergency meetings may be held when necessary.

The National Assembly meeting on the 24th also passed a resolution on the promulgation of the Trade Union Law and four decrees. The four decrees are: decrees on press code, freedom of assembly, right of association, and guarantees of personal freedom and inviolability of people's homes and letters.

In the resolution on the promulgation of the Trade Union Law, the National Assembly agreed with the government's proposal that it is necessary to promulgate the Trade Union Law, and instructed the government to conduct research and draft it.
