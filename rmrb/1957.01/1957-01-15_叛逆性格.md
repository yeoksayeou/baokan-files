Rebellious Personalities
　　Zhang Baoshen

In Russian literature and art, figures such as Onegin, Pechorin, Manilov, Beltov, Rodin, Lensky, and Oblomov have appeared. They form a typical gallery of "superfluous men."

In Chinese literature and art, figures such as Meng Jiangnu, Zhuo Wenjun, Zhu Yingtai, Bai Suzhen, Cui Yingying, Du Liniang, and Lin Daiyu have appeared. Since the discussion of "Dream of the Red Chamber," people have also given this typical gallery a name, calling it: "Rebellious Personalities."

The "superfluous man" or "rebellious personality" are common characteristics extracted from them. This phrase can explain their main aspects, but it can never explain or replace the entire content of these artistic images. Currently, some theorists only focus on "rebellious personality" when discussing these characters; as a result of the analysis, it seems that there is no difference between Lin Daiyu and Zhu Yingtai, and Cui Yingying and Du Liniang have become identical twins. Not long ago, a Sichuan opera troupe in Chengdu performed "The Return of the Soul," which was adapted under this guiding thought. In order to emphasize Du Liniang's rebellious personality, the adapter finally let her elope like Zhuo Wenjun. Similarly, Zhuo Wenjun, who recently appeared on the Beijing stage, can be seen as "Zhuo Wenjun" from the plots such as "elope" and "working in the wine shop", but in terms of the character's performance, it is difficult to see any difference between her and Cui Yingying, and even a shadow of Hongniang can be seen!

The characters created by our ancient great writers are both repetitive and not repetitive. The reason for the repetition is that as a great writer, as long as he is faithful to life, he will reflect the "contemporary hero" of that society; and the reason for not repeating is that these images are all characters with different personalities created by different writers. Although they were all rebels of the society at that time, they each had different personalities, different experiences, and different fates. Cui Yingying would not send winter clothes to Zhang Junrui, and Zhu Yingtai did not elope with Liang Shanbo like Zhuo Wenjun. The reason why these characters are different is not only due to their own different personalities, but also related to the different personalities and creative methods of the specific writers. Du Liniang's "Wandering in the Garden, Awakening from a Dream" is not only related to her personality, but also inseparable from the romantic creative method of Tang Xianzu, a writer full of fantasy.

These rich and colorful artistic images, which are worthy of our deep exploration, are simply generalized by some people with "rebellious personality." As a result, not only are the characteristics of these characters as "individuals" erased, but also various different schools of creation are rejected. It is said that when Tang Xianzu wrote legends, he often stood still for two hours to get a word; when he created "The Peony Pavilion," he even cried for Liniang under the bamboo at night. And we, with a light stroke, turn the awakening from a dream into an elopement, or starting from the concept of "rebellious personality," forcibly unify these gorgeous images. Wouldn't we be ashamed to face our ancestors!

    叛逆性格
    张葆莘
    在俄罗斯文学艺术作品中，出现过奥涅金、彼巧林、玛尼罗夫、别尔托夫、罗亭、连斯基、奥勃洛摩夫等形象。他们组成了一个“多余的人”的典型画廊。
    在我国文学艺术作品中，出现过孟姜女、卓文君、祝英台、白素贞、崔莺莺、杜丽娘、林黛玉等形象。自从讨论“红楼梦”以来，人们也为这个典型画廊取了个名字，称为：“叛逆性格”。
      “多余的人”或“叛逆性格”，都是从他（她）们身上抽出来的共同性，这句话能说明他（她）们的主要方面，却绝不能说明或代替这些艺术形象的全部内容。目前有些理论家们在谈到这些人物时，仅仅在“叛逆性格”上大作文章；分析的结果，似乎林黛玉和祝英台没有了区别，崔莺莺和杜丽娘也变成了一模一样的孪生姊妹。前不久，四川省某川剧团在成都上演的“还魂记”，就是在这种思想指导下改编的。改编者为了强调杜丽娘的叛逆性格，最后也让她和卓文君一样私奔了。同样，最近北京舞台上出现的卓文君，从“私奔”、“当炉”等情节还能看出是“卓文君”之外，就这个人物的表演来说，很难看出她和崔莺莺有什么区别，甚至还能看出了红娘的影子！
    我们古代那些伟大作家，所创造出来的人物形象，既是重复的，又不是重复的。其所以重复，是因为做为一个伟大的作家，只要他忠实于生活，就会反映出那个社会的“当代英雄”；而其所以又不重复，就是因为这些形象都是由不同的作家所创造的具有不同个性的人物。她们虽然都是当时社会的叛逆者，但却各有不同的性格，各有不同的经历，不同的命运。崔莺莺不会去给张君瑞送寒衣，祝英台也没有像卓文君那样跟梁山伯私奔。这些人物所以不同，除了由于她们自己的性格不同之外，和具体作家的不同的个性及创作方法各异也有关。杜丽娘的“游园惊梦”，除了和她的性格有关之外，与汤显祖这个富于幻想的作家的浪漫主义的创作方法也是分不开的。
    这些丰富多采，值得我们深深挖掘的艺术形象，被某些人简单地用“叛逆性格”就概而括之了。结果，既抹杀了这些人物做为“一个人”的特点，也排斥了创作上的各种不同的流派。据说，当年汤显祖写传奇时，为得一字，常痴立两小时；作“牡丹亭”时，还夜至竹下为丽娘哭泣过。而我们，轻轻一笔，惊梦就变为私奔，或从“叛逆性格”这一个概念出发，将这些瑰丽的形象，强求划一，面对祖先，岂不有愧！
