Fuzhou Electric News: An increase production and practice economy campaign is vigorously underway in the industrial system of Fuzhou City. To date, more than 20,000 workers in more than 70 factories across the city have joined the campaign. The director of the Fuzhou Fertilizer Factory vacated his housing to use it as a worker dormitory. The No. 2 Umbrella Factory reduced office expenses by 45%, which workers responded to very well. Leaders of the Fuzhou Chemical Factory personally organized various sections, offices, and workshops to calculate accounts and set eight targets for reducing consumption quotas, reducing workshop expenses by 30%, enterprise management fees by 13%, and saving labor by 3.1%, as well as 11 other savings targets. At the same time, thirty-nine measures were proposed to achieve the above-mentioned increase production and practice economy targets.

The enthusiasm of the workers in each factory is very high. Ten of the thirty-nine measures proposed by the Chemical Factory have been quickly implemented. The attendance rate of the Match Factory has increased from 86% to 93%. The No. 2 Umbrella Factory switched from hand-drawing drafts to printing, and one person can now do the work of nine people in the past, and the quality has also improved. Technicians at the Pharmaceutical Factory also used scrap iron to make a roller sieve separator, creating 800 yuan of wealth.

Many units have established economy teams. The Fujian Machinery Factory used more than 200 tons of iron filings to cast pig iron blocks, saving 8,000 yuan. The No. 2 Machinery Factory's economy team picked up waste materials from many places, recovering more than 13 tons of scrap iron in one week. Workers at the No. 3 and No. 4 Machinery Factories and the Agricultural Machinery Factory also collected tens of thousands of catties of waste metal.

    福州各工厂开展增产节约工作
    本报福州电　增产节约运动已经在福州市工业系统蓬勃地展开。到目前止，全市有七十多个工厂的两万多个职工投入了运动。福州肥料厂长腾出住房当职工宿舍，雨伞二厂减少办公费用45％，工人反映很好。福州化工厂领导人员亲自组织各股、室、车间算帐订出降低八项消耗定额，减少车间经费30％，企业管理费13％，节约劳动力3.1％等十一项节约指标，同时提出了三十九条实现上述指标的增产节约措施。
    各工厂职工劲头都很大，化工厂提出的三十九项措施迅速实现了十项。火柴厂出勤率由86％提高到93％。雨伞二厂改打画稿为印刷，一人就能做过去九人的工作，质量也有提高。制药厂技术人员还利用废铁制成了滚筒筛分离机各一部，创造了八百元财富。
    许多单位都成立了节约队，福建机器厂利用二百多吨铁屑铸成生铁块节约了八千元；机器二厂节约队多处拾废料，一个星期就找回了废铁等十三吨多；机器三、四厂和农械厂职工也收集废金属好几万斤。
