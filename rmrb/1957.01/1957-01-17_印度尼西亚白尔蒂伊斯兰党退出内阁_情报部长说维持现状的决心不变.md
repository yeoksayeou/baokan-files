Xinhua News Agency, January 16th: The Indonesian Cabinet issued a communique yesterday after a meeting, announcing that the Perti Islamic Party has withdrawn from the Cabinet, and has withdrawn Minister of State Wahid from the Cabinet.

The communique stated that the tasks previously entrusted to the Minister of State, including matters related to the struggle to recover West Irian, will henceforth be handled by the Minister of Information.

Indonesian Information Minister Sudibjo emphasized today that the Perti Islamic Party's withdrawal from the Cabinet will not affect the Cabinet's determination to maintain the status quo.

The "Indonesian Torch" newspaper said today that the Perti Islamic Party's withdrawal from the Cabinet was due to pressure from the "Wild Bull Division Committee" that engineered the coup in Central Sumatra, because most of the party's members are in Central Sumatra.

The communique issued by the Cabinet meeting yesterday also announced that, in order to implement the "Basic Law on Local Government" recently passed by the Parliament, the Cabinet meeting approved three government regulations, namely regulations on tax revenue being handled by autonomous regions, regulations on allocating subsidies to autonomous regions, and regulations for the State Council to handle issues regarding financial distribution. This committee was authorized to provide the government with opinions on the implementation of the law on the distribution of central and local finances.

    印度尼西亚白尔蒂伊斯兰党退出内阁
    情报部长说维持现状的决心不变
    据新华社16日讯　印度尼西亚内阁昨天在举行会议后发表公报宣布，白尔蒂伊斯兰党已经退出内阁，从内阁中撤回了国务部长瓦希德。
    公报说，以前托付给国务部长的任务，其中包括和收复西伊里安的斗争有关的事务，今后交给情报部长去处理。
    印度尼西亚情报部长苏迪比约今天着重指出，白尔蒂伊斯兰党的退出内阁对内阁要维持现状的决心不发生影响。
      “印度尼西亚火炬报”今天说，白尔蒂伊斯兰党的撤出内阁是由于受到在中苏门答腊制造政变的“雄牛师委员会”的压力，因为这个党的大多数党员是在中苏门答腊。
    内阁会议昨天发表的公报同时宣布，为了实现最近国会通过的“地方政府基本法案”，内阁会议同意三项政府条例，即关于税收交由自治区处理的条例，关于拨给自治区补助金等的条例和处理关于财政分配问题的国务委员会的条例。这个委员会曾经受权就实施关于中央和地方财政分配法案的问题向政府提出意见。
