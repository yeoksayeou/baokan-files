    A Tour of Vientiane
    By Our Correspondent Zhan Chao
    Vientiane possesses a special beauty. The capital city nestles closely on the east bank of the Mekong River, its urban area extending intermittently for more than twenty kilometers in length and five kilometers in width. A riverside highway traverses the entire city. Alongside the highway, banana trees with budding blossoms, slender and verdant longan trees, ancient and venerable locust trees, coconut trees laden with fruit, towering betel nut trees, and lush phoenix trees grow in a delightful jumble, complementing each other. In the deep shade of the trees, stand Lao-style houses. The vast majority are built on high stilts, and the front of the houses is often enclosed by trees or fences, forming a courtyard of varying sizes. Under the intense sunlight, the sight of these houses evokes a sense of coolness. Many streets are lined with towering trees, their dense foliage providing shade, and the occasional light green building adds to the city's poetic charm.
    The Mayor of Vientiane—a kind elder who once served as the Minister of Religious Affairs of the Kingdom—looked back at the city's construction plan behind him and told me that present-day Vientiane is two to three times larger than it was during the French colonial period and is continuing to grow. Over the decades, the French colonialists left almost nothing behind except for a few Western-style buildings for their offices and residences, a water tower, and a few tennis courts. The asphalt roads were only laid in the one or two years following Lao independence. As one walks through the streets of Vientiane, one can see traces of its expansion everywhere. Many new houses have been built, inhabited by Lao people, overseas Chinese, or other residents. The central vegetable market has been replaced by a much larger new vegetable market located further east, and some of the narrower streets in the commercial district have been converted into one-way streets, which began on the third day of my arrival. On a wasteland in the eastern part of the city, a new administrative area is planned, where new buildings such as the Kingdom Government Office Building, the Kingdom National Assembly Conference Hall, and the Kingdom Normal School have already been erected, while bulldozers continue to work not far away.
    Vientiane now has a population of over 50,000, including approximately 8,000 overseas Chinese. Many of them have been living here since their ancestors' time. Most of them understand Lao and get along well with the Lao people. Some have even intermarried and become relatives. Overseas Chinese are mainly engaged in commerce. On the streets of Vientiane, many shop signs are written in both Lao and Chinese, and the women mostly wear "sarongs," making it difficult to distinguish whether they are overseas Chinese or locals.
    The decades of brutal exploitation by the French colonialists left Laos' economy in a long-term state of backwardness, and Vientiane was no exception. Here, apart from a few semi-manual sawmills, shipyards, rice mills, and other factories, there is almost no industry to be seen. Even rice, fresh fish, and vegetables are imported from Thailand across the Mekong River.
    The commercial scene in Vientiane is quite lively. Since the route from South Vietnam was blocked, goods are mainly shipped from Bangkok and Hong Kong. The shop windows and shelves display goods from many countries, including American "Coca-Cola," French nylon, Thai sarongs, Indian silks, Japanese toys, West German radios, Hong Kong's Three-Five brand undershirts, and also many light industrial products made in China. It is said that Chinese products are cheap, beautiful, and durable, and are very popular among the Lao people and overseas Chinese. Therefore, the quantity and variety of imports have recently increased. Shanghai Golden Star pens, Yunnan ham canned goods, and Guizhou Maotai liquor have also been put on the market.
    In addition to supplying domestic needs, many of Vientiane's imported goods are re-exported. It is said that this is related to transportation price differences, but the main factor is the black market exchange rate of the US dollar.
    The cars on the streets of Vientiane will leave the deepest impression on any traveler. Not only are there many cars, but they are all the latest models from the United States and West Germany. The United States claims that its "aid" to Laos is unconditional, but it does not allow Laos to freely control the funds. Regarding cars, there is a true story circulating in Vientiane: Not long ago, several American businessmen came to Vientiane and were very dissatisfied to see many cars made in West Germany. As a result, the import of West German cars was restricted, and American cars flowed in continuously. Due to the sudden increase in cars, many vehicles have nowhere to park and are left day and night on the sidewalks.
    On the streets of Vientiane, one can also see other sights, such as the American, British, and French news agencies, which occupy a three-legged position in the city center. But the most attractive and representative of Vientiane are the magnificent and ingenious temples, each surpassing the other, fully demonstrating the Lao people's excellent creative genius and rich and colorful cultural heritage.
    The Lao people call temples "Wat." There are forty-three such "Wat" in the Vientiane urban area alone, among which the most famous are "Wat Sisaket," "Wat Ong Teu," "Wat Visoun," and "Wat Phra Keo," each with its own unique characteristics.
    "Wat Sisaket" is where the late Supreme Patriarch, who is well-known to every household in Laos, resided. This temple is built with solemnity and reverence. The walls of the main hall and the surrounding cloisters are carved with countless lotus petal-shaped niches, in which countless bronze Buddhas are enshrined, reminiscent of the Thousand Buddha Caves and Ten Thousand Buddha Caves of the Yungang Grottoes in China. Unfortunately, many Buddha statues have been stolen by colonialists.
    "Wat Ong Teu" is the royal temple, built with particular splendor. The main hall has a large bronze Buddha statue, as tall as two stories, called "Ong Teu" Buddha, which means a Buddha weighing millions of kilograms. Many royal ceremonies are held here. The main hall is very spacious, the floor is paved with patterned bricks, and covered with magnificent carpets.
    "Wat Visoun" is where the current Vice Supreme Patriarch resides. This temple has a unique style, is very grand in scale, and has very exquisite sculptures. The Vice Supreme Patriarch lives in a meditation room with a high platform next to the main hall. He and the Supreme Patriarch, who lives in the royal capital of Luang Prabang, jointly preside over the Buddhist affairs of the country.
    "Wat Phra Keo" is the only temple that does not require bare feet to enter. This temple is named after a crystal Buddha that was brought back from India. The Lao word "Phra Keo" means crystal. It is said that this precious Buddha statue is now in Thailand. Since the Kingdom of Laos became independent, this temple has been converted into a royal museum, displaying many valuable cultural relics from past dynasties. Because this magnificent building, with a history of more than six hundred years, has left a deep impression on the Lao people, it is still called "Wat Phra Keo" to this day.
    Every time I walk into these temples, I am deeply attracted by them. There, one can see the historical journey of this ancient country, which was once the cultural center of Southeast Asia in the thirteenth century, and see the excellent spiritual outlook of its people. (Attached photo)

    万象巡礼
    本报记者　展潮
    万象，具有它特殊的美。这个首都紧紧地傍依着湄公河的东岸，市区断断续续地延伸有二十多公里长、五公里宽。一条沿河公路横贯全市。公路旁边，含蕾将放的香蕉树、轻盈翠绿的龙眼树、老态龙钟的洋槐树、果实硕大的椰子树、超然挺立的槟榔树和枝叶茂盛的凤尾树，错杂地生长着，相映成趣。在树荫深处，是一幢幢富有老挝民族风格的房屋。它们绝大多数都是高柱脚式的，而且屋前常以树木或栏栅圈成一个或大或小的庭院。在强烈的阳光照射下，看到这些房屋，也会使人有种凉快的感觉。许多街道高树参天，浓荫遮地，点缀着一些淡绿色的楼房，更使这座城市增添了几分诗意。
    万象市长——一位过去当过王国宗教事务部长的和善的长者，回头看看他身后的那张市区建设图，告诉我说，现在的万象要比法国殖民者统治时期扩大两、三倍，并且继续在建设中。法国殖民者除了几座供他们办事和住宿的西式楼房、一个水塔、几处网球场外，几十年来几乎没有留下点什么。那些柏油路，还是老挝独立后，近一两年内才敷设起来的。在万象市街上走动的时候，处处都可以看得见它正在扩展的痕迹。这里新建了许多房屋，住着老挝人、华侨或其他人家。市中心的菜市已经被靠东一点的规模大得多的新菜市代替了，商业区里有些比较狭窄的街道也被改成单行线，是我到达的第三天开始实行的。市区的东部的一片荒地上，准备修建成一个新的行政区域，在那里已经矗立起王国政府办公大厦、王国国民议会会议厅、王国师范学校等新的建筑物，而铲土机还继续在不远的地方工作着。
    万象现在共有五万多人，其中华侨约有八千多人，他们很多是自祖辈起就开始在这里侨居的，大部都懂得老挝话，和老挝人民相处得很好，有的并互相婚配，结成了亲戚。华侨以经营商业为主。万象街头，许多商店的招牌都是寮文和中文并写的，而妇女们大多穿着“沙龙”，很难分别她们是华侨或者是本地人。
    法国殖民者几十年残暴的压榨，使老挝的经济长期处于落后的状态中，万象也不能例外。在这里，除了少数半手工的锯木、修船、碾米等工厂外，几乎看不到什么工业。甚至连白米、鲜鱼、菜蔬等，也是从湄公河对岸的泰国运进来的。
    万象的商场相当热闹。自从南越来路被阻滞以后，货物主要是从曼谷和香港两地运来。商店的橱窗、柜架上，陈列着许多国家的货物，有美国的“可口可乐”、法国的呢龙、泰国的纱龙、印度的绸缎、日本的玩具、西德的收音机、香港的三五牌背心，也有中国制造的许多轻工业品。据说中国用品既便宜、美观又耐用，很受老挝人民和华侨的欢迎，因此最近进口的数量和品种都有增加。上海金笔、云腿罐头和贵州茅台酒也上市了。
    万象进口的商品，除了供应国内需要之外，有许多又转运出口。据说，这跟运输差价有关，但主要却是美元黑市汇率在起作用。
    万象街头上的汽车会给任何一个旅客留下最深刻的印象。汽车不仅多，而且都是美国和西德等国最新型的出品。美国口口声声说它对老挝的“援助”是无条件的，但是却不让老挝自由支配各种款项。关于汽车，万象流传着这样的一个真实的故事：不久以前，有几个美国商人来到万象，看到很多西德出品的汽车，大为不满，结果西德汽车被限制进口，美国汽车源源而来。由于汽车骤然的增加，许多车辆没处放，日夜搁置在街头人行道上。
    在万象街头还可以看到别的一些景色，例如鼎足三分盘踞在闹市中心的美、英、法新闻处等等。但是最富于吸引力、也最足以代表万象的，却是那些结构宏丽而奇巧的庙宇，它们一座赛过一座，充分显示出老挝人民优秀的创造天才和丰富多采的文化遗产。
    老挝人民把庙宇叫作“瓦”。这种“瓦”，只在万象市区里就有四十三座，其中最著名的有“瓦细刹吉”、“瓦翁第”、“瓦维赛”、“瓦帕娇”等，它们各有各的特色。
    “瓦细刹吉”，是老挝家喻户晓的已故僧王卜居的地方，这座庙宇修建得庄严肃穆，正殿和四周回廊墙壁上开凿着无数荷花瓣状的神龛，里面供奉着数不清的铜佛，使人不由地联想起中国云岗石窟的千佛洞和万佛洞。可惜的是，有许多佛像已被殖民主义分子盗走了。
    “瓦翁第”是皇家的庙宇，修筑得特别富丽堂皇，正殿有一尊纯铜铸成的大佛像，足有两层楼高，名为“翁第”佛，是千万万斤重佛的意思。皇家有许多仪式都在这里举行，正殿大厅非常宽阔，地板用花砖砌成，铺着华丽的地毯。
    “瓦维赛”，是现今的副僧王居住的地方，这座庙宇又别具风格，规模也是十分宏大的，而且雕塑非常精美。副僧王就住在正殿旁边的一座筑有高台的禅室里。他和住在王都琅勃剌邦的僧王共同主持全国的佛教事务。
    “瓦帕娇”，是唯一一座不须要赤脚进去的庙宇。这座庙宇以从印度奉迎回来的一尊琉璃佛而得名。老挝话“帕娇”就是琉璃的意思。据说这座名贵的佛像现在在泰国。自从老挝王国独立以后，便把这座庙宇改成皇家博物馆，陈列着历代许多宝贵的文物。因为这座有着六百多年历史的巍峨的建筑物，在老挝人民心中留下很深刻的印象，因此直到现在仍旧被叫作“瓦帕娇”。
    每次当我走进这些庙宇的时候，都要被它们深深地吸引住。在那里，可以看到这个在十三世纪曾经是东南亚文化中心的古国的历史行程，看到它的人民优异的精神面貌。（附图片）
