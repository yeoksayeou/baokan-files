    New Inventions in Soviet Daily Necessities
    Fountain Pen Without Ink
    The windows of stationery stores in Moscow have recently featured a new type of fountain pen that has attracted attention. This is a fountain pen that does not need to be filled with ink. When in use, it only needs to draw in ordinary clean water, and ink will continuously seep from the nib, making writing very convenient. Inside the pen barrel, there is a block of ink ointment. When the pen draws in clean water, part of the ointment dissolves into ink. One block of ointment can dissolve into one liter of ink, equivalent to about seventeen ordinary bottled inks. Therefore, one block of ointment can be used for several years, and new ointment can be installed after it is used up.
    Au-to-ma-tic Shoe-Shining Machine
    There is a shoe repair shop in Moscow where customers enter with dusty leather shoes and come out a minute and a half later with their shoes bright and shiny.
    This is thanks to the automatic shoe-shining machine. It is a small cabinet. When customers need to shine their shoes, they simply place their feet in a certain position under the cabinet and insert a fifteen-kopeck coin into the small hole on the cabinet. The shoe-shining process then begins: a bristle brush first wipes away the dust from the shoes from left to right; a small bottle hanging in the center of the automatic device then dispenses an appropriate amount of liquid shoe polish onto the shoes; a cloth brush made of special yarn, installed on the other side, then evenly spreads the shoe polish over the entire surface of the shoe, making the shoes shine. The entire operation takes only one and a half minutes. Moreover, the shoe-shining machine uses colorless shoe polish, so leather shoes of any color, whether yellow or black, can be used.
    Bathhouse that Heats Water with Sunlight
    Recently, a bathhouse that does not require tickets and provides free bathing has appeared near Ashgabat.
    This bathhouse has no boiler room at all. It does not require any fuel, yet it receives a continuous supply of hot water at a suitable temperature. It uses sunlight as fuel. When water flows from the storage tank into the bathhouse, it passes through many pipes, which are placed on iron sheets painted black, with the iron sheets tightly covered with glass. The solar energy absorbed by the black surface heats the water in the pipes. This device can heat one hundred and fifty liters of cold water per hour.
    Automatic Film Advance Camera
    Among photography enthusiasts in the Soviet Union, there is recently good news circulating: the Soviet Union has produced a new type of camera—the "Leningrad" camera. It has a special feature: the photographer can use it to take ten scenes in a row without stopping to wind the film.
    This camera is equipped with an automatic device that advances the film by one frame each time the shutter is pressed, in preparation for the second exposure. This is of great value for quickly capturing precious scenes and composing large scenes.
    The camera is also equipped with other complete equipment, such as a linked contactor for flash, a linked regulator, and an optical device for correcting parallax.

    苏联日用品中的新发明
    不需要墨水的钢笔
    莫斯科出售文具的商店的橱窗里，最近出现了一种新型钢笔，吸引着人们的注意。这是一种不需要灌吸墨水的钢笔。在使用的时候，只须吸入普通的清水，笔尖上就能源源不断地渗出墨水来，书写起来非常方便。在这种钢笔的笔管里，装着一块墨水软膏，当钢笔吸入清水后，一部分软膏即溶化为墨水。一块软膏可以溶化为一公升墨水，相当于普通瓶装墨水十七瓶左右。因此一块软膏可以使用几年，而且用完后还可以再装新的软膏。
    自　动　擦　鞋　机
    莫斯科有这样一家修鞋店，顾客们穿着蒙着灰尘的皮鞋进去，隔一分半钟出来，皮鞋就变得起明发亮了。
    这是自动擦鞋机的功劳。它是一个不大的柜子，顾客需要擦皮鞋的时候，只要把脚放在柜下一定的地位，然后在柜上的小孔中投下一个十五戈比的硬币，刷鞋程序便开始了：一个毛刷首先自左到右擦去皮鞋上的灰尘；挂在自动装置中央的一个小瓶子接着流出适量的液状鞋油到鞋上；装在另一边的用特别的纱制成的布刷便把鞋油在整个鞋面上擦匀，把皮鞋擦得发亮。整个操作过程只需要一分半钟的时间。而且擦鞋机使用的是无色鞋油，因此，皮鞋不分黄黑，一律可以使用。
    用阳光烧水的浴池
    最近，在阿什哈巴德附近出现了一个不要买票的浴池，免费供人洗澡。
    这个浴池根本没有锅炉间，它不需要任何燃料，可是却源源不断地得到温度适宜的热水的供应。它是用阳光做燃料的。水从贮水罐流进浴池的时候，经过许多管子，这些管子放在漆成黑色的铁皮上，铁皮上面紧紧地复盖着玻璃。黑色的表面所吸收的太阳热能就使水管里的水变热。这种装置每小时可以烧热一百五十公升冷水。
    自动转动软片的照相机
    在苏联摄影爱好者们中间，最近流传着一个好消息：苏联新出产了一种新型照相机——“列宁格勒”照相机。它有一个特殊的性能，摄影者能够用它连照十个场面而不用停下来卷软片。
    这种照相机里安装着一个自动装置，每当按捺开关一次，这个自动装置就能够使软片转过一格，以备第二次再接受曝光。这对于迅速摄取宝贵的场面和拼摄大场面有很大的价值。
    这种照相机的其他设备也很齐全，例如它装有闪光灯用的联动接触器、联动调整器和纠正视差的光学装置等。　　　　（新华社）
