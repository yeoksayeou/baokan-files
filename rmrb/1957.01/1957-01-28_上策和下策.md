The slogan against waste has already been sounded. In all places where the masses have been fully mobilized, waste phenomena are difficult to flaunt in the streets, like "rats running across the street, everyone yelling 'kill them!'"

However, there is also a kind of waste that is easily overlooked. This is waste within the opposition to waste. The so-called waste within the opposition to waste, on a large scale, includes attention to saving raw materials but neglecting product quality, resulting in "Lin Daiyu type" machine tools and "Sunday shoes" type daily necessities; attention to saving gasoline but neglecting normal driving speed, thus turning cars into ox carts, and so on. These are relatively one-sided, have significant harm, and are therefore more familiar to people, who often use them as a warning. However, there is a kind of waste within the opposition to waste that is often unnoticed unless compared, and therefore receives little attention.

There is such a thing: the No. 3 workshop of Suzhou Huasheng Paper Mill discharges one thousand tons of "wastewater" into a small river every day. After testing, it was found that these "wastewater" contained 350 kilograms of pulp and chemical raw materials, worth 175 yuan. This means that the national property lost from the "wastewater" each year amounts to 58,000 yuan.

The waste phenomenon has been discovered, so how to plug this loophole? The technical staff proposed a plan to build a "wastewater recovery tower," estimated to cost 45,000 yuan.

It seems that this is not a bad plan. Investing 45,000 yuan can recover 58,000 yuan of wealth in a year. Isn't this an effective measure to oppose waste? However, Wu Shuiquan, the workshop duty officer, proposed another plan that only requires a wooden board and a rubber tube to recover the pulp and chemical raw materials from the "wastewater." In the end, Huasheng Paper Mill adopted Wu Shuiquan's plan and plugged the waste loophole of "wastewater" without spending a penny.

Here, it is not to criticize the technical staff who proposed the first plan; they tried every means to plug the "wastewater" loophole, and there is nothing to criticize. The lesson this gives us is that after the waste loophole is discovered, the choice of methods to plug the loophole needs to be cautious. Choosing the best strategy means spending less money, or even no money, to plug the loophole; choosing the worst strategy, although it also plugs the loophole, costs more money. Compared to the former, the latter is also a kind of waste; and this waste, because it is generated from plugging the waste loophole, is often not easily discovered.

For an enterprise leader, what is important is not only to discover waste loopholes and plug them, but also to adopt the most economical method of plugging the holes, preventing waste in plugging the holes. Is there a trick here? Yes. This is to mobilize the masses, think of more methods, compare them with each other, and see which method is more economical and effective.

    上策和下策
    吴滤
    反对浪费的口号，已经叫响了。凡是充分发动了群众的地方，“老鼠过街，人人喊打”，浪费现象是难招摇过市的。
    然而，也有一种浪费，却是容易被忽视的。这就是反对浪费中的浪费。所谓反对浪费中的浪费，从大的方面说，有注意了节约原材料，忽视了产品质量，因而出现了“林黛玉型”的机床，“礼拜鞋”之类的日用品；有注意了节约汽油，忽视正常的行车速度，因而汽车变成牛车等等。这些，都是片面性比较大，危害比较显著，因而也是人们比较熟悉，常常引以为戒的。但是，有一种反对浪费中的浪费，若不经过比较，往往看不出有什么浪费，却不大被人注意。
    有这样一件事情：苏州华盛纸厂三号车间每天有一千吨“废水”流到小河里去。经过测定，发现这些“废水”里有三百五十公斤纸浆和化学原料，值一百七十五元。这就是说，每年从“废水”中流失的国家财产达五万八千元。
    浪费现象是发现了，怎样来堵塞这个漏洞呢？技术人员提出的方案是建造“废水回收塔”，估计费用是四万五千元。
    看起来，这未尝不是一个好的方案，花四万五千元投资，一年就可以回收五万八千元财富，不是反对浪费的有效措施吗？然而，车间值班员吴水泉却提了另一个方案，只要用一块木板和一根橡皮管，就可以回收“废水”中的纸浆和化学原料。最后，华盛纸厂采纳了吴水泉的方案，没有花一个钱，就把“废水”这个浪费的漏洞堵住了。
    这里，倒不是批评提第一个方案的技术人员；他们想方设法，堵“废水”之漏洞，没有什么可以批评的。这件事给我们的教育是，浪费的漏洞发现之后，选择堵洞的方法却需慎重。选了上策，少花钱，甚至不花钱，就堵了漏洞；选了下策，虽然也堵了漏洞，却多花了钱。两者比较，后者也是一种浪费；而这种浪费，因为是堵浪费之漏洞而产生的，常常不易发现。
    对一个企业领导者说来，重要的，不只是发现浪费的漏洞，堵住它，而且是要采用最节约的堵洞的方法，防止堵洞中的浪费。这里有没有窍门呢？有的。这就是发动群众，多想些方法，相互比较，看看究竟哪个方法更节约，更有效。
