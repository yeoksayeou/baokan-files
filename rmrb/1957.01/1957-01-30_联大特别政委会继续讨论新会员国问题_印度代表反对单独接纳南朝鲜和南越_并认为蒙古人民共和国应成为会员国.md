Xinhua News Agency, January 29th, New York: Indian Representative Lal said at the United Nations General Assembly Special Political Committee meeting on the 28th that India opposes the separate admission of South Korea and South Vietnam into the United Nations, pointing out that this is a violation of the “Geneva spirit.” He asked if allowing part of each divided country to participate in the United Nations conforms to the goal of striving for unification proposed by the United Nations?

Lal also requested at the meeting that the Mongolian People's Republic be admitted as a member state of the United Nations. He said that India believes that excluding this country is "completely unrealistic and unfortunate."

He and the Syrian representative put forward a joint proposal suggesting that the recommendations made during this meeting, along with relevant documents, be submitted to the Security Council, and requesting the Security Council to consider all applications for joining the United Nations.

Indian Representative Lal said that if the committee does not pass this proposal, India will vote in favor of the Soviet proposal. This proposal calls for the admission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam into the United Nations, as well as the admission of South Korea and South Vietnam.

Czechoslovakia and Poland spoke in support of the Soviet proposal at the meeting on the 28th. Burma opposed the Soviet proposal and also opposed the US proposal.

    联大特别政委会继续讨论新会员国问题
    印度代表反对单独接纳南朝鲜和南越
    并认为蒙古人民共和国应成为会员国
    据新华社29日讯　纽约消息：印度代表拉尔28日在联合国大会特别政治委员会会议上说，印度反对联合国单独接纳南朝鲜和南越，他指出这是违反“日内瓦精神”的。他问道，如果允许每个分裂的国家的一部分参加联合国，这是否符合联合国提出的争取统一的目标呢？
    拉尔还在会上要求接纳蒙古人民共和国为联合国会员国。他说，印度认为，把这个国家排斥在外是“完全不现实的、不幸的”。
    他同叙利亚代表提出一个联合提案，建议把这次会议期间提出的建议连同有关文件一并交给安全理事会，并且要求安全理事会考虑所有要求参加联合国的申请。
    印度代表拉尔说，如果委员会不通过这个提案，印度将投票支持苏联的提案。这个提案要求接纳朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国参加联合国，同时也接纳南朝鲜和南越参加联合国。
    在28日会议上发言支持苏联提案的有捷克斯洛伐克和波兰。缅甸反对苏联提案，也反对美国提案。
