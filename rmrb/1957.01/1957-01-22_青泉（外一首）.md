    Azure Spring (and another poem)
    Sha Ling
    Azure Spring is like a bright eye of Lanzhou, shimmering with a touch of azure in the spring, bestowing tenderness upon the tourists... Wisps of azure willows stir gentle breezes, and the light wind scatters the fragrance of wildflowers; people from Jiangnan scoop up a handful of spring water to taste the early spring of the plateau. It is hard to say whether the scenery is intoxicating, or the tourists are all young, only spring can answer this.

    Goose Shoal is like coral on the water surface, Goose Shoal amidst the rolling waves... Some say: in ancient times, wild geese came here to seek spring. Day and night, they carried earth and dropped it into the Yellow River, building land to settle down and live; now Goose Shoal is lush with greenery, and the songs are like rolling waves... The wild geese do not know where they have flown, but hasn't spring already come to the banks of the Yellow River?

    青泉（外一首）
    沙陵青泉犹如兰州的一只明眸，春天里泛着一股青光，赠予了游客柔情……缕缕青柳撩起丝丝风，轻风撒开了野花香；来自江南的人，掬一把泉水，尝尝高原的早春。不知是风景醉人，还是游客个个年青，这只有春天才能回答。
    雁滩好像水面的珊瑚，滚滚波涛间的雁滩……有人说：远古的年代里，大雁到此寻觅春天。日夜衔土抛下黄河，筑起陆地安家生活；而今雁滩碧色丛丛，歌声像浪涛滚滚……大雁不知飞向何处，春天不已经来到黄河边？
