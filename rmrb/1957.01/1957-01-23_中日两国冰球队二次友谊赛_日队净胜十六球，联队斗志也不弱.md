    Second Friendly Match Between Chinese and Japanese Ice Hockey Teams
    Japanese Team Wins by Sixteen Goals, Joint Team Shows Strong Fighting Spirit
    (Our report) In the final game last night (January 22nd), the Japanese ice hockey team defeated the Beijing-Harbin joint team by a score of sixteen goals.
    Japanese right forward number eight, Shin-ichi Honma, is a brave general adept at attacking key positions. He scored six goals on his own throughout the game. The other Japanese team members also played more calmly yesterday than in the game against the Beijing team, allowing their team's skills to be fully utilized. The Japanese players all said that the joint team's skills were extraordinary. They had already seen this during warm-up activities, so they were extra careful in this game.
    The joint team, composed of ice hockey players from Harbin, a city renowned as an advanced collective, and athletes from Beijing, possesses considerable strength. The audience greatly praised their "drive," which reflects the fine qualities of courage and fearlessness of difficulties of the Chinese people. Although they failed to break through the opponent's goal due to their relatively poor basic skills, their morale was no less than that of the visiting team.

    中日两国冰球队二次友谊赛
    日队净胜十六球，联队斗志也不弱
    本报讯　日本冰球队昨晚（22日）最后一场比赛中，净胜北京、哈尔滨联队十六球。
    日本八号右前锋本间信一是一员最善于攻坚的勇将，全场他一人独得六个球。日本队其他队员昨天也打得比同北京队比赛时更加沉着，因此全队技术得以充分发挥。日本队员都说联队技术不比寻常，在作准备活动时他们就已经看出这点，所以他们对这场比赛也倍加小心。
    曾被誉为哈尔滨市先进集体的冰球运动员和北京市运动员所组成的联队实力较雄厚。观众很赞扬他们的“干劲”，这种“干劲”能够反映出我国人民勇敢、不怕困难的优良品质。尽管由于基本技术较差，他们没能攻破对方球门，但是士气是不亚于客队的。
