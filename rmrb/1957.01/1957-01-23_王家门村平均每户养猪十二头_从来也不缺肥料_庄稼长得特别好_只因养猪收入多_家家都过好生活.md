Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, January 19th: The Zhejiang Daily published on the 16th, in a front-page headline, a report by Du Dexin about Wangjiamen Village in Haining County, where each household averages twelve pigs and each person raises more than two pigs.

The report said that Wangjiamen, in Xieqiao Township, Haining County, is a small natural village with ten households and a total of fifty people, known throughout the county for raising a lot of pigs. They are a production team of the Huangdun Agricultural Producers' Cooperative. Last year, they raised and bred a total of 272 pigs; after selling some and eating three, the village still has 120 pigs, averaging twelve pigs per household and 2.4 pigs per person. Every family in the village has a sow.

Because every household in this production team raises pigs, they never have a fertilizer shortage; instead, they worry about not having enough space to store the manure. The village now has 2.5 pigs per mu of paddy field. Because there is plenty of manure, they use very little chemical fertilizer. Last year, the unit yield of crops such as rice and rapeseed planted by this production team exceeded the average level of the entire cooperative. They have also applied a lot of manure to the current winter crops. Others apply only five or six dan of manure per mu of land, but they have applied more than ten dan, so the wheat and rapeseed are growing particularly well.

Wangjiamen Village has a river harbor full of aquatic plants, which are exclusively for feeding pigs. They can be harvested and fed year round for eight months. The village is full of large vats too big to embrace, containing sweet potato vines, bean leaves, weeds, and other things pressed down with large stones. After these green fodders are fermented and softened, they become the main feed for pigs. Only sows and piglets are fed some refined feed like soybean cake. The farmers in this village use many kinds of green fodder; they have found that pigs love to eat them as long as they are fermented and cooked. Locally, there is a saying that "grass-fed pigs don't grow strong," but most of the "grass-fed pigs" they sell weigh between 150 and 200 jin.

Because they use green fodder to feed pigs, raising pigs is very profitable. Raising a meat pig can earn at least 20 to 30 yuan after deducting various costs (including labor). Raising sows is even more profitable, earning about 150 yuan per year per sow. Therefore, every family here is very wealthy. Wang Guirong, a pig-raising expert, sold forty fat pigs in one go in 1953, earning more than 24 million yuan in old currency. In that same year, Wang Guirong built a beautiful new three-bay house.

A farmer in this village said humorously, "Pigs are truly the best 'manure-making machines.' For example, using aquatic plants to fertilize the fields, they won't rot for ten days or half a month, but if pigs eat them, they turn into manure the next day, and the fertilizer effect is much better."

The pigs in Wangjiamen Village are raised privately by each household, and the purchase of feed is done through collective procurement and unified distribution. The procurement tasks are rotated by each household, which does not affect farm work. Cooking feed is also done by each household, taking up time in the morning and evening, so it takes up very little time from agricultural production.

### 王家门村平均每户养猪十二头  从来也不缺肥料　庄稼长得特别好  只因养猪收入多　家家都过好生活

    王家门村平均每户养猪十二头
    从来也不缺肥料　庄稼长得特别好
    只因养猪收入多　家家都过好生活
    新华社杭州19日电　浙江日报16日以一版头条的地位，刊载了杜德馨写的海宁县王家门村平均每户养猪十二头、每人养猪两头多的消息。
    这条消息说，海宁县斜桥乡王家门是一个小自然村，全村有十户人家，共五十口人，素以养猪多而闻名全县。他们是黄墩农业生产合作社的一个生产队，去年一年共饲养和繁殖了生猪二百七十二头；除去外卖和自己吃了三头以外，现在全村还养着生猪一百二十头，平均每户养猪十二头，每人二点四头。村里家家有母猪。
    这个生产队，因为户户养猪，从来不发生缺肥的问题，反愁粪肥没处盛放。村里现在每亩水田有两头半猪。因为粪肥多了，所以连化学肥料也很少用。在去年，这个生产队种植的水稻、油菜籽等作物的单位面积产量都超过了全社的平均水平。他们对现在的冬季作物也浇了很多粪肥，别人一亩田只浇五、六担粪，他们已浇了十多担，因此小麦和油菜都长得特别好。
    王家门村前有一条河港，里面长满了水草，这种草是专供猪吃的，随吃随捞，一年可吃八个月。村里到处是合抱不住的大缸，里面用大石块压着番薯藤、豆叶、野草等东西。这些青饲料发酵软化以后，就成了喂猪的主要饲料。只有母猪和小猪才喂给一点豆饼之类的精饲料。这村农民利用的青饲料，种类很多；他们发现只要经过发酵、煮熟，猪都很爱吃。当地有“吃草猪长不壮”的话，但是他们卖出的“吃草猪”，大部分都有一百五十到两百斤。
    由于用青饲料喂猪，养猪很赚钱。他们养一头肉猪，除去各种成本（包括所花的劳动）后，至少可赚二、三十元。养母猪的利润更多，每头一年能赚一百五十元左右。因此这里每家的生活都很富裕。养猪能手王桂荣在1953年一次就卖出了四十头肥猪，共卖得旧币两千四百多万元。就在那一年，王桂荣造了一幢漂亮的三开间新屋。
    这村的一个农民很有风趣地说：“生猪真是最好的‘造粪机器’，比方用水草壅田，十天半月都不烂，而给猪吃了，第二天就变粪，肥效也好得多。”
    王家门村的猪都由各户私养，对购买饲料采取集体采购统一分配的办法。采购任务由各户轮流，不影响农田的劳动。煮饲料也是各户抽早晚时间煮的，因此占用农业生产的时间很少。
