Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 12th—In many areas of Henan Province, handicraft workers use indigenous methods to smelt iron and steel, providing the country with tens of thousands of tons of steel annually. This method of smelting iron and steel using indigenous methods has attracted the attention of relevant departments.
    More than fifty counties in Henan Province are rich in iron ore. As early as before, in the mountain valleys and riverbanks of western and southern Henan, people used indigenous methods to smelt iron and steel to manufacture production tools and daily necessities. Last year, when the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry sent people to Henan Province to purchase scrap steel, they found handicraft workshops smelting iron and steel in Xinyang, Nanyang, Luoyang, Xinxiang and other regions. The raw materials for these workshops include iron sand flowing down from the upper reaches of various rivers and iron ore mined from the mountains. The Henan Provincial Handicraft Industry Federation is currently investigating the production situation. Last year, Xinyang Region smelted 2,700 tons of wrought iron, which sold very well. After slight improvements in equipment and technology this year, it is expected to produce around 10,000 tons.
    Henan Province has great potential for indigenous iron and steel smelting. Because its equipment is simple and raw materials are abundant, relevant departments, if actively supporting, can rapidly and extensively expand production. The indigenous blast furnace used in Xinyang Region to smelt pig iron can be made in just five working days, and its total value is only about 35 yuan; the low furnace used to smelt wrought iron can be made in only three working days, with a cost of only about 10 yuan. Other labor tools, such as wooden bellows, iron hammers, and iron rods, are very cheap and easy to manufacture. An indigenous blast furnace can produce 2,000 catties of pig iron in one day and one night, and a low furnace can smelt more than 1,200 catties of wrought iron in twelve hours. Recently, some indigenous blast furnaces have replaced hand-pulled wooden bellows with blowers, and the daily output has immediately increased from 2,000 catties to 3,000 catties.

    河南省土法炼铁潜力大
    原料充足，设备简单，成本低廉
    新华社郑州12日电　河南省许多地区的手工业者用土法炼铁炼钢，每年可以为国家提供上万吨的钢铁。这种用土法炼铁炼钢的办法已经引起了有关部门的注意。
    河南省五十多个县都蕴藏有铁矿。很早以前，豫西、豫南的山窝里和河岸旁，就有人用土法冶炼钢铁用来制造生产工具和生活资料。去年冶金工业部派人到河南省收购废钢铁的时候，在信阳、南阳、洛阳、新乡等专区，都找到了冶炼钢铁的手工业作坊。这些作坊的原料，有的是从各河上游飘流下来的铁砂，有的是从山上开采的铁矿石。河南省手工业联合社最近正在调查生产情况。去年信阳专区冶炼成的熟铁就有两千七百吨，销路很好。今年在设备、技术等方面略加改进以后，预计可以出产一万吨左右。
    河南省土法冶炼钢铁的生产潜力很大。由于它的设备简单，原料充足，有关部门如果积极扶持，能够迅速地、大规模地扩大生产。信阳专区冶炼生铁用的土高炉，只要五个劳动日就能做成一座，它的全部价值也不过三十五元左右；冶炼熟铁用的低炉只用三个劳动日就能做成，成本才十元左右。其他劳动工具如木风箱、铁锤、铁棍等都是非常便宜而又容易制造的。一座土高炉一天一夜就能出生铁两千斤，低炉十二小时能炼成熟铁一千二百多斤。最近有的土高炉用鼓风机代替了手拉的木风箱以后，日产量立即由两千斤提高到三千斤。
