I heard that Quanjude's turnover in 1956 increased by 70% compared to 1955, and Cuihualou almost increased by 100%. Although it is not known how the Beijing Hotel, Heping Hotel, and Donglaishun are doing, judging from the "grand occasion" in front of their doors, their business must be very prosperous. Looking at the account books of these restaurants, they record the names of the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Food Industry, the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations… and other government agencies. The banquets set by the above-mentioned agencies are of course for official receptions of foreign and domestic guests, and are by no means private social gatherings. But I feel that the trend of holding banquets is a bit excessive, so I would like to say a few words.

It is common courtesy, both in China and abroad, to hold banquets to entertain foreign guests, and there is nothing wrong with that. Moreover, in our hospitable country, it is not unusual to invite foreign guests to taste Chinese food, especially to appreciate the famous Peking roast duck and涮羊肉 (shuan yang rou, or mutton hotpot). Although there are some areas worth reviewing and reducing, I am willing to skip them.

As for holding banquets to entertain "domestic guests," there is more to discuss. Of course, some of these banquets are necessary. But some departments convene various administrative meetings and professional meetings, and the representatives are nothing more than directors of departments and bureaus, chiefs of divisions and sections, managers, and factory directors in charge of work. Somehow, once they arrive in Beijing, they become "guests" and are often treated to small and large banquets. This is mostly not due to the requirements of the "guests," but out of the enthusiasm of the "hosts." In addition, some schools hold banquets to celebrate the completion of construction or the graduation of students, some industrial and mining enterprises hold banquets to celebrate the completion of new construction or the successful trial production of new products, and some mass organizations hold banquets to promote friendship through sports and cultural activities... There are really many names. There are many reasons why these units hold banquets, but the main ones are nothing more than celebrating the victory of past work and wishing for the further development of future work. Especially for the former type of meeting, it is not enough to discuss the guidelines and policies, and finally, a dinner is added as a finishing touch, as if it would be incomplete without it.

After the central government issued the call for increasing production and practicing economy, some agencies still refused to stop, simply changing the name to "simple meal."

I am not against holding banquets and cocktail parties in general, but banquets and cocktail parties have no inevitable connection with our revolutionary work. During the 25,000-mile Long March, climbing snow-capped mountains and crossing grasslands, not only were there no dinners, but we ate tree bark and grass roots; during the War of Resistance Against Japan, running around in mountain gullies and living in thatched cottages, we never had dinners, and we only ate sorghum, millet, and sweet potatoes; but we still won in the end.

Some comrades may think that we are building socialism, the financial situation has improved, and there is plenty of money, so why not spend it? In fact, this is a manifestation of being a little dizzy by victory. Our country did not strike it rich overnight, and besides, does the construction of socialism not require a lot of funds? Isn't our country's capital still very limited? It cannot withstand this kind of extravagance and waste. In the eyes of the people, their casual banquets can only be regarded as wasteful behavior.

    设宴种种
    缪群
    听说，全聚德1956年的营业额比1955年增长了70％，萃华楼几乎是增长了100％。北京饭店、和平宾馆、东来顺如何虽不得而知，但从他们门前的“盛况”看起来，生意想也是十分兴隆的了。看一看这些饭店、菜馆的账簿，上面记着的是商业部、地质部、农业部、食品工业部、对外文化联络局……等机关的名字。以上这些机关的设宴，当然是因公招待外宾和内宾的，绝不会是私人酬酢。但我觉得，设宴之风有些过盛了，于是想说几句话。
  设宴招待外宾，在中外古今的礼节上都是常有的事情，无可厚非；而且以我们中国这样一个好客的国家，请外宾尝一尝中国菜的滋味儿，特别是请他们赏识一下著名的北京烤鸭和涮羊肉，实在也不算什么破格的事情。尽管其中也有一些值得检点节缩的地方，我也愿略过不谈。
    至于设宴招待“内宾”，值得谈论的地方就多了。其中当然也有一些宴席是必要的。但有些部门召集的各种行政会议、专业会议，会议的代表无非都是些厅、局长，处、科长，经理、厂长等负责工作人员。不知怎的，一到北京，他们就变成为“客人”了，往往飨以小宴大宴。这大都不是由于“客人”的要求，而是出于“主人”的热忱。此外，也有些学校为筹备建成或者学生的结业设宴，也有些工矿企业为新建落成或新产品试制成功设宴，也有些群众团体为增进文体活动的比赛友谊而设宴……。真是名目繁多。这些单位所以要设宴，道理很多，但主要的无非是庆祝过去工作的胜利，和预祝将来工作的进一步开展。尤其是前一类的会议，讨论了方针政策还嫌不够，最后还要以会餐一顿作为润色，仿佛不如此，就会美中不足似的。
    某些机关在中央发出增产节约的号召以后，还不肯罢休，只是把名目改为“便餐”罢了。
    我并不是一概反对举行宴会、酒会，但宴会、酒会跟我们的革命工作并无必然的联系。在二万五千里的长征中，爬雪山、过草地，不独没有会餐，吃的竟是树皮草根；在抗日战争中，跑山沟，住茅屋，也不曾会餐，吃的不过是高粱、小米、山药蛋；但是我们却终究胜利了。
    有些同志可能以为我们在建设社会主义了，财经状况好转了，钱有的是，不花干吗？其实这是被胜利冲得头脑有些昏昏然了的表现。我们的国家并没有在一个晚上发了横财，何况建设社会主义不是还需要大量资金吗？我们国家的资金不是还有限得很吗？那里招架得住这种大吃大喝的挥霍浪费。在人民眼里，他们的随便设宴只能算是败家子行径。
