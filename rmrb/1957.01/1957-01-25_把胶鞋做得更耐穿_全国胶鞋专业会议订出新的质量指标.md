To Make Rubber Shoes More Durable
National Rubber Shoe Professional Conference Sets New Quality Standards

(Our Newspaper's Report) The Daily Chemical Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry recently convened the Second Rubber Shoe Professional Conference to summarize last year's work and discuss specific measures for increasing production and practicing economy.

Last year, the quality of rubber shoes nationwide improved significantly. According to tests conducted at five factories, the wearing life of rubber shoes increased by approximately 17.8% to 50% compared to previous years. Over the past year, rubber shoe factories have designed more than 800 new designs and varieties based on different climates, seasons, and wearing objects, of which 347 have been officially put into production. Among them, children's shoes, men's and women's casual shoes, sandals, cotton shoes, women's semi-high heels, high boots for forest areas, etc., have been welcomed by consumers. However, some factories' products did not meet the standards. For example, the rubber shoes produced by State-owned Rubber Factory No. 8 can be worn for an average of 154 days, but some factories produce rubber shoes that can only be worn for 60 to 70 days, and some even break after 40 days. The factory with the highest utilization rate of cotton cloth reached 97%, while the lowest factory only utilized 75% of a bolt of cloth. This situation shows that the potential for increasing production and practicing economy in the rubber industry is very large. According to statistics, if rubber shoe factories across the country increase the average wearing days of rubber shoes by 15%, it would be equivalent to increasing production by 15 million pairs of rubber shoes; increasing the utilization rate of cotton cloth by 1% could save more than 7,000 bolts of cloth, which could be used to produce 800,000 pairs of rubber shoes.

The conference revised the quality indicators for rubber shoes. The new indicators stipulate that the average wearing time for sneakers produced by rubber shoe factories across the country should be more than 110 days for team trials and more than 145 days for student trials; labor shoes should be worn for an average of 100 days, and rubber-surface ingot shoes should be worn for more than 100 days by workers in fish markets. At the same time, the conference set the highest targets for 34 factories including Dahua, Zhengtai in Shanghai, and Rubber Factory No. 1 in Tianjin, requiring that the average wearing time for sneakers produced by these factories should reach more than 135 days for team trials, more than 170 days for student trials, 140 days for labor shoes, and an average of more than 120 days for ingot shoes. The utilization rate of cotton cloth is required to reach more than 86%.

The supply of raw materials for the rubber industry this year is relatively tight, but leading authorities and enterprises have expressed confidence in overcoming these difficulties.

### 把胶鞋做得更耐穿  全国胶鞋专业会议订出新的质量指标

    把胶鞋做得更耐穿
    全国胶鞋专业会议订出新的质量指标
    本报讯　轻工业部日用化学工业管理局最近召开了第二次胶鞋专业会议，总结去年的工作，并且讨论了增产节约的具体措施。
    去年，全国胶鞋的质量有很大改进。据五个厂的试验，胶鞋的穿着寿命比以前提高了17.8％到50％左右。一年来，各胶鞋厂根据不同的气候、季节，和不同的穿着对象，设计了八百多种新的花色品种，正式投入生产的有三百四十七种。其中童鞋、男女便鞋、凉鞋、棉鞋、女用半高跟鞋、林区用高统靴等等，都受到了消费者的欢迎。但是，也有些厂的产品没有达到标准。例如国营橡胶八厂生产的胶鞋，平均能穿一百五十四天，可是有些厂生产的胶鞋只能穿六十到七十天，个别的还有穿四十天就破的。棉布的利用率最高的厂达到97％，最低的厂一匹布只利用了75％。这种情况说明，橡胶工业增产节约的潜力是很大的。据统计，如果全国各胶鞋厂把胶鞋的穿着天数平均提高15％，就等于增产一千五百万双胶鞋；把棉布利用率提高1％，就可以节约七千多匹布，用这些布可以增产八十万双胶鞋。
    会议修改胶鞋的质量指标。新的指标规定：全国胶鞋厂生产的球鞋，球队试穿平均穿着一百一十天以上，学生试穿达到一百四十五天以上；力士鞋平均穿着一百天，胶面元宝鞋鱼市场工人试穿一百天以上。会议同时给上海的大中华、正泰和天津的橡胶一厂等三十四个厂订了最高指标，要求这些厂生产的球鞋，球队试穿平均达到一百三十五天，学生试穿达到一百七十天以上，力士鞋达到一百四十天，元宝鞋要达到平均穿着一百二十天以上，棉布利用率一律要求达到86％以上。
    今年橡胶工业的原材料供应比较紧张，但是领导机关和各企业都表示有信心克服这些困难。
