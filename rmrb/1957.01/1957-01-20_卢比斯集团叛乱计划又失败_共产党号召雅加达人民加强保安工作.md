    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 19th - "Indonesia News" reported today that the responsible authorities in the Indonesian capital had received specific reports that elements of the Lubis Group and other lawless elements had planned to launch illegal actions simultaneously in the city recently. The plan was originally fully arranged.
    After receiving the report, the Jakarta Garrison Command decided to launch a search on the 20th, but due to a leak, those plotting the mutiny hurriedly held a meeting to discuss countermeasures and transferred all important items elsewhere. After learning of this, the Garrison Command advanced the search to begin on the evening of the 16th. According to a spokesman for the Jakarta Garrison Command today, about twenty people have been arrested.
    "Indonesia News" said that the results of this search were extremely satisfactory.
    The Jakarta City Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party issued a statement today calling on the people of the capital to assist the Garrison Command in the measures taken to strengthen security and eliminate anti-republican groups, and to prepare for any incidents that the reactionaries may launch. The statement also called on the people of the capital to be vigilant and strengthen security in all streets and for all government agencies and important enterprises.
    The statement said that after suffering a series of defeats, the reactionaries are now trying to strike at the heart of the Republic of Indonesia—Jakarta.

    新华社雅加达19日电　“印度尼西亚新闻”今天报道，印度尼西亚首都负责当局曾经接到具体的报告说，卢比斯集团分子和其他一些不法分子曾经计划最近要在市内同时发动非法行动。这个计划本来一切都已安排成熟。
    雅加达卫戍司令部在接到报告后，决定在20日发动搜捕，但由于消息泄露，那些谋变的分子便急忙举行会议筹商应付，并且把一切重要物件转移他处。卫戍司令部在获悉之后，更提前在16日晚上开始发动搜捕。据雅加达卫戍司令部发言人今天说，已经逮捕约二十人。
    “印度尼西亚新闻”说这次搜捕成绩极令人满意。
    印度尼西亚共产党雅加达市委员会今天发表声明，号召首都人民协助卫戍司令部为加强保安和肃清反共和国集团所采取的措施，并且准备应付反动派可能发动的一切事变。声明还号召首都人民提高警惕，加强各街道和对各政府机关和重要企业的保安工作。
    声明说，反动派在遭受一连串失败之后，又在力图打击印度尼西亚共和国的心脏——雅加达。
