　　I went to visit the factory where seventy-three-year-old Communist Party member Yu Dequan worked, having heard so much about him. However, he had already gone to the Benxi Workers' Sanatorium for a rest. But, everyone knew him well when he was mentioned, and they respectfully called him "Old Yu."

　　Warehouse Director Li Guozhong enthusiastically led me to the warehouse. On wooden plaques on either side of the warehouse door were written a couplet: "Saving is for building socialism," "Utilizing waste is for liberating Taiwan." This was written in lime by Yu Dequan in 1954, and the writing had become blurred by the wind and rain. This warehouse was also built by Old Yu, leading a few temporary workers, using broken mats, scrap wood, and old nails pulled from wood planks left over from construction. As soon as the door was pushed open, it was like walking into a dazzling hardware store. Here, from the smallest screw caps to dozens of kilograms of gates, there were about a thousand varieties, all carefully classified and placed in wooden boxes on wooden shelves, one next to the other, and cards were established and recorded in the books.

　　I asked the warehouse director, "Did Old Yu collect all of these?" The warehouse director, as familiar as he was with himself, told me about Old Yu's past and present. This old mechanical worker, who started as an apprentice at the age of sixteen and suffered all kinds of torture in the old society, regarded the factory as his own home from the day he was liberated and re-entered his factory. In the first two years when the country was carrying out planned construction, he saw steel, iron pipes, and parts scattered all around the factory that had been discarded during the enemy puppet and Kuomintang rule... He suggested to the leadership that these were all state property produced by the workers' blood and sweat and should be managed! The factory director adopted his suggestion and decided to have him responsible for managing these materials. From that time on, he moved from his dormitory, which was several miles away from the factory, to live inside the factory. For seven or eight years, he got up early and went to bed late every day. As soon as he put down his rice bowl, he would go to the piles of junk to look for equipment. He never returned empty-handed. Last year, once he came back from the machine repair workshop and saw a screw in a broken porcelain bottle by the roadside. He took it out and brought it back as if it were a treasure. Whenever Old Yu had time, he used his repaired vise and wire brush to repair the equipment he had picked up. Those without caps were fitted with caps, and those with rust were brushed clean. From 1953 to last year, Old Yu recovered and repaired more than two thousand pieces of plumbing equipment and mechanical parts, more than three thousand two hundred and seventy kilograms of various screws, and more than ten thousand kilograms of non-ferrous metals.

　　Currently, more than four hundred tons of various stagnant materials in Old Yu's warehouse have been used for factory equipment maintenance and to support national construction. At the end of last year, the reduction workshop was being overhauled and urgently needed to replace eighteen acid and alkali resistant white stainless steel valves. The factory had no spare parts, and it would cost 300 yuan to buy one on the market, and it was not available for a while. At this time, Old Yu remembered more than forty white stainless steel valves that had been recovered in the warehouse but not yet repaired. He suggested that the factory director instruct the machine repair workshop to repair them. As a result, eighteen were repaired, completing the workshop overhaul task ahead of schedule. Another time, an explosion accident occurred in a workshop in the factory, requiring it to be repaired in a few days. The supply personnel were unable to buy materials from other places in time. More than one hundred and sixty plumbing parts and two hundred screws urgently needed for the repair were also found and solved from the parts he had repaired. In the past, workers thought that the parts repaired from waste materials were messy, rusty things, and they were reluctant to use them; now, they see that the materials in the warehouse are washed clean, and many materials that the supply department could not purchase for a long time have been supplied. They all say: This stagnant material warehouse has become a treasure house; some people even affectionately call it "Old Yu's warehouse." The equipment that the factory does not need is sold by the supply department to other factories. On the eve of the New Year, when the No. 2 turbine generator of Jilin Thermal Power Plant was put into production, more than five hundred heating radiators were needed, which were all solved from "Old Yu's warehouse." Recently, another batch of materials was sold to local industrial factories in Jilin City to process agricultural implements for farmers.

　　Since 1953, Old Yu has been elected as a labor model in Jilin City and Jilin Province every year. He also participated in the National Advanced Producers Representative Conference held last year. In the successive increase production and practice economy campaigns in Jilin City, all factories used him as an example to inspire and educate employees.

    爱厂如家的“于老”
    新华社记者　陈子林
    我慕名去七十三岁老共产党员于得泉所在的工厂访问，他已经到本溪工人疗养院休养去了。但是，一提到他人们都很熟悉，并且都很尊敬的称呼他为“于老”。
    仓库主任李国忠热情地把我领到仓库去。仓库门两旁木牌上写着一付对联：“节约是为建设社会主义”，“利废是为解放台湾”。这还是于得泉在1954年用石灰浆写的，经过风吹雨打，字迹已经模糊不清了。这座仓库也是于老领着几个临时工利用施工剩下的破席、碎木板和从木板上起出的旧钉子盖起来的。门一推开，就像走进了一个琳琅满目的五金商店。这里从最小的螺丝帽到几十公斤重的闸门，约有一千多种，都被细心地分成类，放在木架上一个挨着一个的木箱里，并且建立了卡片，记入账簿。
    我问仓库主任：“这些都是于老拣回来的吗？”仓库主任像熟悉自己一样，向我谈起了于老的过去和现在。这个从十六岁就开始当学徒，在旧社会受尽折磨的老机械工人，从得到解放重新走进自己的工厂那天起，就把工厂当作自己的家。还在国家有计划地进行建设的头两年，他看到工厂四周到处是敌伪和国民党统治时期扔下的钢材、铁管、零件……，就向领导上提出：这些都是工人用血汗生产出来的国家财产，应该管理啊！厂长采纳了他的建议，并且决定由他负责管理这些材料。从那时候起，他便由离工厂几里路远的宿舍搬到厂内来住了。七、八年以来，他每天都是起早睡晚，只要饭碗一放，就到各破烂堆里找器材。每次出去，他都没有空手回来过。去年，有一次他从机修车间回来见到路旁一块破瓷瓶内有根螺丝钉，就像珍宝一样把它取出带回来。于老一有空就利用自己修复的老虎钳和铁刷子，修理拣回来的器材。没帽的配上帽子，有锈的刷锈。从1953年到去年，被于老收回和修复的水暖器材和机械零件，有两千多件，各种螺丝三千二百七十多公斤，有色金属一万多公斤。
    目前，于老仓库内的各种呆滞器材，已经有四百多吨被用作厂内设备检修和支援国家建设去了。去年年底，还原车间大修理，急需更换十八个耐酸碱的白锈钢阀门，厂内没有备品，市场上买一个需要三百元，而且一时还买不到。这时，于老想起了以前回收在库内尚未修理的四十多个白锈钢阀门。他建议厂长责成机修车间修理。结果修复了十八个，提前完成了车间大修任务。另一次，厂内有个车间发生了爆炸事故，要求在几天内抢修好。供应人员去外地买材料来不及，检修中迫切需要的一百六十多个水暖零件和两百个螺丝，也从他修复的零件中找来解决了。过去工人们认为从废料中修复的零件，都是乱七八糟的生锈的东西，不乐意用；现在看到库内的材料洗刷一新，许多过去供应科长期无法采购的材料，得到了供应，都说：这个呆料库成了宝库了；有的人还亲切地叫它为“于老仓库”。厂内用不着的器材，就由供应科到外厂去推销。新年前夕，吉林热电厂二号汽轮发电机投入生产的时候，需要五百多件暖气片，都是从“于老仓库”解决的。最近又有一批材料被推销到吉林市地方工业工厂为农民加工农具。
    于老从1953年以来，年年被选为吉林市和吉林省劳动模范。去年召开的全国先进生产者代表会议他也参加了。吉林市各工厂在历次增产节约运动中，都以他为范例去鼓舞教育职工。
