    Sealed Core Sampler
    A sealed core sampler has recently been successfully trial-manufactured at the Caijiagang Mining Machinery Factory.
    The sealed core sampler, from the outside, looks like a tube 1.8 meters long and 83 centimeters in diameter. However, inside this tube, there are also 126 parts of various sizes that can seal the gas inside the borehole and bring it up, providing reliable gas data for mine construction. In the past, core samplers were not sealed, and the gas easily dissipated. If the gas grade is not accurately determined, the amount of ventilation required for the mine is often miscalculated; underestimation can easily lead to accidents, while overestimation can lead to waste of ventilation equipment.

### 密闭式岩心采取器

    密闭式岩心采取器
    密闭式岩心采取器，最近已在蔡家岗矿山机械厂试制成功。
    密闭式岩心采取器，从外表上看，是一种长一点八公尺、直径八十三公分的管子。但是在这管子里面，还有一百二十六个大小零件，可以在钻孔里就把瓦斯密封好带上来，给矿井建设提供可靠的瓦斯资料。过去，岩心采取器不是密闭式的，瓦斯很容易跑散。瓦斯的等级判不准，矿井需要的通风量就往往计算不准，算小了容易造成事故，算大了就要造成通风设备的浪费。
