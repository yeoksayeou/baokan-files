Intimate and Inseparable

    If you go to the Zhoushan Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office, the comrades there will tell you many stories about how the stationed troops actively supported the local area. What impressed the local party and government comrades the most was the support given by the troops stationed in Zhoushan to the local area during the fight against the typhoon in August last year.

    On July 29, the troops received an emergency typhoon warning and immediately stopped training for three days to help residents with the harvest. More than 17,000 mu of ripe rice was harvested by the soldiers before the typhoon struck. On August 1st and 2nd, when the typhoon struck, the leading comrades of the Zhoushan Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office were away on business. The leaders of the army troops stationed in Zhoushan and the naval troops on vacation took the initiative to go to the Prefectural Committee and jointly directed the fight against the typhoon and disaster relief in the Zhoushan area with the comrades of the Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office. Those days, they often went in the morning and didn't return to their units until midnight. Although the troops themselves were facing arduous tasks in resisting the typhoon, they told the local comrades: "We will fully support you, with people if you need people, boats if you need boats, and vehicles if you need vehicles." Hearing that more than 160 fishermen fishing in the Dongji District of Putuo County were trapped on Langgang Mountain, an isolated island, and were in a critical situation, the comrades of the Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office were worried about this. The navy and army troops took the initiative to send ships to deliver food to the trapped fishermen. At that time, the typhoon had not yet passed, and there were still force seven or eight winds at sea. According to regulations, ships were not allowed to leave the port. However, in order to rescue the fishermen brothers, the soldiers fought against the wind and waves for three days and two nights and finally delivered the food to Langgang Mountain. After the typhoon, the telephone lines on the islands in the Zhoushan area were broken and difficult to repair for a while, so the troops dispatched transportation to help the Commissioner's Office and the counties maintain communication. Hearing that the comrades of the Grain Bureau said that 40,000 jin of rice had been soaked in water, the troop leadership immediately notified the troops to stop eating good rice and receive the soaked rice instead. The army and navy troops also automatically launched a donation campaign, raising 23,000 yuan in cash and 4,900 pieces of clothing in a very short period of time, and jointly organized a delegation to express condolences and provide relief to the affected people.

Second Lieutenant and the Old Man

    At 3:12 PM on December 17 last year, the passenger train from Shangrao to Shanghai had not yet entered the station, but the platform was already crowded with waiting passengers. The northwest wind mixed with light drizzle blew against their faces; everyone on the platform was shivering with cold, their faces turning purple.

    An old man in a light blue coarse cloth robe, who looked to be in his sixties, was also waiting for the train on the platform. He sat on a stool, shrinking his neck and shivering with cold, his nose tip purple and red, and clear liquid running down. People all looked at the old man with sympathy. … Just then, a soldier in his mid-twenties wearing a second lieutenant's epaulets came over, handed his leather overcoat to the old man, and said kindly:

    "Old man, put on this coat!"

    The old man looked in astonishment at this unfamiliar officer who was not wearing very thick clothes himself, and hurriedly declined, saying, "I'm not cold, I'm not cold."

    "Still saying you're not cold!" The second lieutenant sounded both distressed and surprised, "Look how cold you are, come on, put it on quickly, so you don't get sick from the cold." He insisted on putting the leather coat on the old man's shoulders.

    "This..." The old man quickly straightened the coat, but he didn't know what to say.

    "What's the matter! Old man, put it on quickly! You can give it back to me when the train comes."

    The old man wrapped himself tightly in the leather coat, took two steps, and suddenly remembered that he hadn't asked the officer's name yet, but when he looked around, the second lieutenant had already gone to the other end of the platform.

    The train came, and the old man had warmed up, his face turning slightly red. He handed the leather coat back to the second lieutenant. The old man had just opened his mouth to say something, but he was immediately stopped by the second lieutenant:

    "Old man, get on the train quickly."

    The old man nodded. When he stood at the train door, he kept looking at the second lieutenant, expressing his gratitude in silent words. The second lieutenant watched him get on the train, and then smiled and ran with a soldier standing next to him towards the "hard seat sleeper car".

    Later, I found out that the second lieutenant's name was Wang Wenhou. (Jiang Huilong)

A Big Apple

    A few days ago, in the room where the telephone squad of a certain unit stationed in a village near Lüda lived, I found a big apple hanging next to the "Excellent Squad" award banner with a white string. The apple had the four green characters "Army and People as One" on it, which were not written with a pen or carved with a knife. What was going on?

    The comrades in the telephone squad told me: "This big apple was a gift from our landlord, Old Man Qu. Old Man Qu is sixty-two years old this year, and he treats us better than his own family. Whenever he eats something fresh, he always remembers us. The comrades on night sentry often hear Old Man Qu's kind reminders: 'It's cold, put on more clothes!'" When I visited Old Man Qu, he said: "The People's Liberation Army came to live in my house, I didn't have to carry burdens or touch a broom, and they helped me build walls and dig cellars. I really felt bad about it, how could I thank them? If I sent them something, they definitely wouldn't accept it, but there was really no way...

    "A few days ago, my eldest granddaughter bought five jin of apples from Dalian. I picked a big apple that was half red and half green, wrote the four characters 'Army and People as One' on the green side with a brush, and put it in the sun for two days. After it turned red, I wiped off the ink, and the green characters appeared on the apple. I sent this apple to the People's Liberation Army to show my appreciation."

    Old Man Qu packed the dried apple and the apples that his eldest granddaughter had bought in a small porcelain basin and sent them over. Of course, the soldiers refused to accept them. Old Man Qu had no choice but to pick out the apple with the writing and say, "Then you can keep this one!" When the soldiers saw this apple, they all scrambled to touch it first. They said to Old Man Qu, "We are determined to learn our skills well, improve our technology, and use practical actions to thank you." (Tian Fugui)

    拥政爱民——解放军的传统
    亲密无间
    你如果到舟山地委和专署去，那里的同志会给你讲出很多驻军主动支援地方的事。给地方党政机关同志印象最深的，是去年8月抗御台风斗争中驻舟山部队支援地方的行动。
    7月29日，部队接到了台风紧急警报，立即停止操课三天，帮助居民抢收。一万七千多亩成熟了的稻子在台风来袭之前被战士们抢收了。8月1日和2日台风来侵时，适逢舟山地委和专署负责同志因公外出，驻舟山陆军部队首长和正在休假的海军部队首长就主动到地委会去，和地委、专署的同志共同指挥舟山地区的抗御台风和抢险斗争。那几天他们经常是早上去，半夜里才回部队。虽然部队本身也面临着艰巨的抗御台风任务，但是他们却对地方同志说：“我们全力支援你们，要人有人，要船有船，要车有车。”听说在普陀县东极区捕鱼的一百六十多个渔民被困在孤岛浪岗山上，情况危急，地委和专署的同志们正在为这事着急，海军和陆军部队就主动派船给被困的渔民送食品。当时台风还没有过境，海上还有七、八级大风，按照规定，船只是不能出港的。但是为了救援渔民兄弟，战士们连续和狂风巨浪搏斗了三天两夜，终于把食品送上了浪岗山。台风过后，舟山地区岛上的电话线路都被刮断，一时不易修复，部队就抽出交通工具，帮助专署和县保持通信联络。听到粮食局的同志说有四万斤大米被水浸湿，部队领导机关就立即通知部队停止食用好米，领取遭水浸湿的米吃。陆海军部队还自动发起捐献，在很短时间内就筹集了现款两万三千元和衣服四千九百件，并且联合组织了慰问团，慰问和救济受灾人民。　						（胡奇坤）
    少尉和老人
    去年12月17日三点十二分，上饶开往上海的客车还没进站，站台上就挤满了候车的旅客。西北风夹杂着星星细雨，扑面吹来；站台里的人个个冻得脸色发紫。
    一个穿着浅蓝色粗布单长袍的老人，看来有六十多岁了，也在站台里等车。他坐在凳子上，缩着脖子，冻得身上打抖，鼻尖紫红，朝外直淌清水。人们都同情地望着这位老人。……正在这时，一个二十五、六岁佩着少尉肩章的军人走过来，把自己的皮大衣递到老人面前，亲切地说：
    “老大爷，你穿上这件大衣吧！”
    老人惊愕地望着这位穿得并不厚实的陌生军官，忙不迭地推辞道：“不冷不冷。”
    “还说不冷呢！”少尉像又是痛惜，又是奇怪，“你看你冻的，来，快披上，免得冻病了。”他硬把皮大衣披在老人肩上。
    “这……”老人连忙扶正大衣，嘴里却不知说什么是好。
    “这有什么！老大爷你快穿上吧！一会火车来了再还我。”
    老人紧紧用皮大衣裹着自己，走了两步，忽然想起，刚才还没问问那位军官叫什么名字，可是他四处寻找，少尉早已走到站台的另一头去了。
    火车来了，老人已经暖和过来，脸上变得微红，把皮大衣递还少尉。老人刚张嘴想说两句什么，立刻被少尉止住了：
    “老大爷，你快上车吧。”
    老人点点头。当他站到车门上，还一再望着少尉，用无声的言语，表达感激的心情。少尉瞧他上了车，才微笑着和跟他站在一起的一位战士朝着“硬席寝车”跑去。
    以后，我打听到这个少尉的名字叫王文厚。
                （姜惠龙）
    一个大苹果
    前些日子，我在驻旅大某村部队电话班住的屋子里，发现一个大苹果，用白线绳吊在“优胜班”的奖旗旁边。这个苹果上有“军民一家”四个绿色字，不是用笔写的，也不是用刀子刻的。怎么回事呢？
    电话班的同志们告诉我：“这个大苹果是房东曲老大爷送的礼物。老大爷今年六十二岁啦，对咱比亲人还亲，每逢吃点什么新鲜东西总是忘不了咱。夜间站岗的同志也常常会听到老大爷亲切的叮咛：‘天冷啦，多穿上点衣服！’”我去访问曲老大爷时，他说：“解放军打住我家来，扁担没上我的肩，扫帚没沾我的手，还帮我砌墙、挖菜窖。我心里真是过意不去，怎么样谢谢他们才好呢？送点什么吧，他们一定不肯接受，可真也没有办法……
    “前几天，我大孙女从大连买回家五斤苹果，我挑了个半红半绿的大苹果，在绿色的那面，用毛笔写上‘军民一家’四个字，放在太阳光下晒了两天，晒红了以后擦掉墨迹，苹果上就显出了绿色的字样。我就把这个苹果送给解放军表表心意。”
    老大爷把晒好的苹果和他大孙女买回来的苹果一起装在小磁盆里送去了，战士们当然不肯收。老大爷没办法，就把带字的那个苹果挑出来，说：“那你们留下这个吧！”战士们看到了这个苹果，都争着要先摸一摸。他们对老大爷说：“我们决心学好本领，提高技术，用实际行动来感谢你。”　　　　（田福贵）（附图片）
