Several Problems in Geographical Research Work
    Qi Yunfeng
    Geography is increasingly demonstrating its important role in human production activities. In our march towards nature, we must first have a full understanding of the natural environment (geographical environment). That is to say, we must have a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the natural elements (terrain, climate, rivers, lakes, oceans, soil, plants, animals, glaciers, etc.) that form the geographical environment, their mutual constraints and influences, and the laws of their movement and development. This huge task of reconnaissance and comprehensive analysis and research of nature is precisely the task that geographical science must undertake first. Following the development of natural survey and research, the formulation of development and construction plans will follow. To make the formulated plan conform to objective conditions and be feasible, in addition to considering the conditions and requirements of social production development and our subjective strength, we must also consider the deployment of work in accordance with the laws of motion of the natural environment itself. As for scientifically and comprehensively allocating social productive forces according to natural resources, population, and other historical and social conditions, and according to the requirements of social production development, so that the production structure of various departments and the production cooperation of various regions can fully move according to their internal laws, this is a complex, arduous, and urgent task for geographical science.

    Geographical science has developed to this day and has formed many independent scientific departments. First, according to the different research objects, fields, and methodological principles, as well as the connection with natural science or social science, it is divided into physical geography and economic geography. In the scientific fields of physical geography and economic geography, many independent scientific branches have also been formed. These scientific branches have formed independently developed scientific departments because they have specific scientific objects; at the same time, they have to form a geographical science complex because the research objects themselves have close internal connections. This also makes them mutually dependent and cooperate in the battle to march towards nature and develop social production.

    Since liberation, in the economic construction of our motherland, geographical scientists, together with personnel from other scientific departments, have made great efforts for national construction, and their footprints have spread almost all over the motherland. Whether it is the fundamental control of the Huai River, the investigation and compilation of the Yellow River control plan, the survey of the comprehensive development and utilization of the Yangtze River, the Heilongjiang River and many other large and small water systems, the survey and selection of important railway trunk lines, the survey and determination of shelterbelts, or the investigation and compilation of important urban construction plans, geographers have done a lot of important work. For example, building reservoirs for flood control and water storage involves a series of issues that require geographers to conduct scientific investigations and analyses. The construction of a reservoir will submerge some areas, so it is necessary to conduct accurate surveys and calculations of the losses due to submergence. The extent of the losses must be understood by understanding the specific conditions of the reservoir's topography, soil productivity, dam height, and backwater range, and these losses must be calculated according to detailed topographic maps based on contour intervals. Then compare the losses and benefits to determine whether the reservoir is suitable for construction. The size of the reservoir's benefits also needs to go through careful geographical investigation and analysis. For example, the size of the reservoir depends on the reservoir's topography and river flow, and the size of the river flow depends on the changes in rainfall upstream of the reservoir and the longer-term hydrological records. The irrigation area of the reservoir and its benefits to agricultural production increase, as well as the market for reservoir power and the economic benefits after the improvement of shipping, must be carefully investigated, analyzed, and calculated to determine the economic value of building the reservoir. The geographical work of building a reservoir is so complex, and it is conceivable how much geographical work is required for the investigation, research, and compilation of watershed plans involving many aspects. The efforts of geographers in recent years have provided many valuable scientific blueprints for our country's construction work.

    However, the geographical science work in our country is not only far behind the needs of construction, but also, in general, lags far behind the advanced level of the world. Up to now, our country's scientific geographical work related to topography, climate, hydrology, soil, etc., has not been able to extend to all parts of the country. For example, in terms of climate, the isobars, isohyets, and isotherms in most of the western half of the map are still blank. Many large rivers in the southwest with abundant hydropower resources have not been systematically hydrologically studied at all. As for the geographical distribution of plants and animals across the country and the research work of this type of geographical science, even less has been done.

    Geographical science work in our country has a vast field and broad development prospects; the geographical work before us is really complicated, and there are also many problems that need to be solved urgently. Here I put forward some personal opinions.

    Geography is a science that involves an extremely wide range. Chinese geography alone involves China's geology, topography, climate, hydrology, soil, plants, animals, as well as the development of China's industrial, agricultural, and transportation production, and even China's history, ethnicity, population, and social customs. If each researcher or institution collects, sorts out, and researches the materials required for the research work themselves (of course, this is also something that should and must be done), it will inevitably cause a waste of manpower. More importantly, due to the small number of people, the scope of collection is limited, the results are slow, and it cannot be systematically supplied. If a national data compilation agency is set up to centrally organize, uniformly compile and print, and periodically publish supplies, it will achieve twice the result with half the effort. Now, professors and researchers of economic geography have to spend a large part of their energy and time just collecting and sorting out relevant reference materials from newspapers and magazines every day. Moreover, they often neglect one thing for another, so that sometimes teaching materials or research content miss new materials, affecting the quality of teaching and research work.

    As for specialized scientific works and scientific journals, we should of course strengthen their manuscript collection, editing, and publishing work separately. At present, most geography-related journals are published quarterly, with only a few papers in each issue. Efforts should be made to change the quarterly publication to a bimonthly or even monthly publication as soon as possible, or to expand its content and volume. Some scientific journals and specialized academic works before liberation should also be reprinted and supplied as soon as possible.

    Whether it is scientific research work or geographical professional teaching work, there is a unanimous and very urgent need for a relatively detailed and complete map of our country; and our country's construction undertakings are expanding rapidly to all corners of the country, and the movement of construction personnel from all aspects is also becoming more and more frequent. A detailed and accurate map is also very much needed. The compilation and printing of maps involves many aspects. In order to get things done as soon as possible, the relevant parties can cooperate and collaborate. Other maps such as world maps, various wall charts, provincial, county, and city maps for scientific research and geographical teaching should also be published as soon as possible.

    Learning all the advanced geographical science and technology in the world depends to a large extent on timely organizing and introducing the geographical sciences of the major countries in the world. First of all, we must expand the introduction of the practical achievements and treatises of geographical science in the Soviet Union and other socialist camp countries, as well as the main scientific debates; in addition, we should also appropriately and timely introduce representative treatises and major scientific debates in the geographical activities of capitalist countries.

    In the scope involved in geographical science research, what should be kept secret? What can be made public? This was not clear in the past, and some materials that could be made public to facilitate research were also "confidential." This hindered the development of scientific research work, and I hope that the relevant parties will pay attention to improvement.

    地理学研究工作中的几个问题
    齐云峰
    地理学愈来愈显示出它在人类生产活动中有着重要作用，我们在向自然界进军的过程中，必须首先要求对自然环境（地理环境）有充分的了解。也就是说，我们必须对形成地理环境的各自然要素（地形、气候、河流、湖泊、海洋、土壤、植物、动物、冰川等）本身和它们相互制约、彼此影响的内在联系，以及它们运动发展的规律，有系统的全面的了解。这个对自然进行侦察活动并全面地分析和研究的巨大工作，正是地理科学所首先要担当的任务。随着对自然调查研究工作的开展，继之而来的是开发建设方案的制定。要使得所制定的方案合乎客观条件，切实可行，除了必须考虑社会生产发展的条件、要求和我们的主观力量外，还必须按照自然环境本身的运动规律来考虑工作部署。至于根据自然资源、人口以及其他历史和社会的条件，按照社会生产发展的要求，来科学地全面配置社会生产力，使各部门的生产结构和各地区的生产协作，能够依其内在规律充分地运动，那对于地理科学来说，更是复杂艰巨而迫切的任务。
    地理科学发展到今天，已经形成了许多独立的科学部门。首先按照研究对象、领域和所持方法论原则的不同，以及同自然科学或社会科学的联系，而划分为自然地理学和经济地理学。在自然地理和经济地理两门科学领域中，还形成了很多独立的科学分支。这些科学分支，都因为它们具有特定的科学对象，所以形成了独立发展的科学部门；同时也由于研究对象本身有密切的内在联系，而又不得不结成地理科学的综合体。这也就使得它们在向自然进军、发展社会生产的战斗中，互相依赖，分工合作。
    解放以来，在我们祖国的经济建设中，地理科学工作者同其他科学部门的人员一道，为国家建设作了很大的努力，他们的足迹几乎遍于祖国各地。不论是淮河的根治，治黄规划的调查编制，长江、黑龙江以及其他许多大小水系综合开发利用的勘查，重要铁路干线的选线调查，防护林带的勘查选定，或者是重要城市建设规划的调查和编订等，地理工作者都做了许多的重要工作。如防洪蓄水要修建水库，就有一系列问题，必须地理工作者作科学的调查和分析。水库的建筑要淹没一些地区，因此就必须对淹没损失进行精确的调查和计算。而计算损失的程度又得了解水库的地形、土壤的生产力、坝的高低和回水范围等具体情况，并且要根据详细的地形图，按等高距离计算出这些损失，然后比较损失和效益，决定水库是否宜于修筑。至于水库效益的大小，也同样要经过缜密的地理调查分析工作。如水库的大小需要看水库地形、河水流量，而河水流量的大小又得看水库上游降雨的变化和较长期内的水文记录。水库的灌溉面积和对农业保产增产的效益，以及水库电力的市场、航运改善后的经济效益等都得经过详细的调查、分析和计算，才能确定兴建水库的经济价值。兴建一个水库的地理工作就这样复杂，牵涉到许多方面的流域规划的调查、研究和编制所需要作的巨大地理工作就可想而知了。地理工作者几年来的努力，对于我们祖国的建设工作提供了不少宝贵的科学蓝图。
    但是，我国的地理科学工作，不仅远远赶不上建设的需要，而且就总的方面来看，还大大落后于世界先进的水平。一直到今天为止，我国有关地形、气候、水文、土壤等方面的科学地理工作，还没有能够扩及到全国各地。如在气候方面，地图上西半部大部地区的等压线、等雨线和等温线都还是空白。西南部许多水力资源丰富的大河，就根本没有作过系统的水文工作。至于全国植物、动物在地理上的分布和这类地理科学的研究工作就做得更少了。
    我国的地理科学工作有着广阔的园地和远大的发展前途；摆在我们面前的地理工作，真是头绪纷繁，同时也就有不少问题急待解决，这里我提出一些个人意见。
    地理这门科学涉及的范围极广，单就中国地理来说，就涉及到中国的地质、地形、气候、水文、土壤、植物、动物以及中国的工农和运输业生产的发展，乃至中国的历史、民族、人口和社会的风土习俗等。如果各研究人或机构都自己搜集整理研究工作所需的资料，（当然这也是应该和必须作的），就势必造成人力浪费，并且更重要的是由于人手少，以致搜集范围有限、收效慢和不能系统供应。如果设置一个全国性的资料汇编机构，集中整理，统一编印和定期出版供应，那就会事半功倍。现在教授和研究经济地理的人，每日仅搜集整理报章、杂志有关参考资料，就要付出很大一部分精力和时间。而且还常常顾此失彼，以致有时教材或研究内容漏补新的材料，影响教学和研究工作的质量。
    至于专门性的科学论著和科学学报，当然也要分别加强其集稿和编辑出版工作。现在有关地理方面的学报，大多每季一刊，每期不过几篇论文，应该早日争取变季刊为双月刊甚至月刊，或者扩大它的内容和份量。解放前的一些科学学报和专门性的学术论著，也应该及早翻印供应。
    不论是科学研究工作，还是地理专业的教学工作，对于一本较为详实完善的本国地图的需求，都一致感到十分迫切；而我国的建设事业，正日益迅速地扩及到全国各个角落，各方面建设人员的移动往还也愈来愈频繁，对于一本详细正确的地图，也是很需要的。地图的编印涉及到许多方面，为了早日把事情办好，可以由有关方面配合协作。其他如供科学研究和地理教学用的世界地图，各种挂图，省、县、市图，也要早日出版。
    学习世界一切先进地理科学技术，在很大程度上要依靠及时地组织介绍世界各主要国家的地理科学。首先要扩大介绍苏联和其他社会主义阵营各国的地理科学实践成就和论著，以及科学上的主要争论；此外，也应该适当地及时介绍资本主义国家地理学活动中具有代表性的论著和科学上的主要争论。
    在地理科学研究所涉及的范围中，那些应该保密？那些可以公开？这在过去不明确，有的可以公开便利于研究的资料也“保密”了。这就妨碍了科学研究工作的开展，希望有关方面注意改进。
