    Watch
    Bo Xiang
    Whenever I hear about government bonds, I get excited. Yes, over the past few years, I have formed an indissoluble bond with government bonds!
    Sometimes, people ask me, "Why do you buy so many government bonds?" I always stare at them for a long time, unable to speak. Indeed, even I don't know why!
    I remember my past life very clearly. Before liberation, in order to fight for the right to survive, I had to struggle on the line of life in my childhood. After liberation, like many other young people, I joined the revolution, and my life became stable from then on. With the development of the country's socialist construction, my salary has also gradually increased. In addition to my own living expenses and sending some money to my mother, I can save a sum of money every month. What should I do with this money? This question often churned in my mind. Before I found an answer, I had to deposit the money in the bank.
    Living in this great era, the motherland is undergoing tremendous changes every day, every hour, even every second. Thinking about the rapid development of the motherland, I deeply feel that I should make full use of my life. Therefore, I feel the need for a watch. With a watch, I can better grasp time and make full use of it. Sometimes, I stand in front of the glass counter of the department store, and when I see the brand-new watches, I can't help but be moved. From then on, I saved money to buy a beloved watch.
    The money saved is increasing day by day, and I can buy a watch; but I didn't buy it. I thought, can I make full use of time with a watch? Not necessarily. Without a watch, although there are some inconveniences in some aspects, I can still make full use of time. Take me, for example, a watch is not so urgently needed.
    I really like watching movies. When I see the molten steel pouring out of the furnace on the screen, when a new textile factory starts all its machines and weaves colorful fabrics, how excited I am! I feel as if I am not in the cinema, but beside the steelworkers and textile girls. How much money is needed to build a new steel industrial base! Thinking of this, I feel a sense of responsibility spontaneously: I should not only work hard, but also help the country's construction with the surplus money. A newly built textile factory can recover the entire investment in one year of production. The capital turnover is so fast, how good it would be if the country could use this money! Thinking of this, I was so excited, as if the question of the past few years had been answered: Yes, I should buy government bonds with the surplus money! In that year, I bought government bonds with all the money I had in the bank, and spent more than twenty yuan to buy myself an alarm clock.
    Since then, several years have passed. Every year, I always buy government bonds with my savings; until now, my hands are still bare, and there is still only that alarm clock at home.
    One day, it was snowing. I returned home after finishing a day's work, and when I sat by the small stove to warm myself, I felt how happy our life was! I picked up the bound volume of the "People's Daily" from October last year, and as I flipped through it, on the October 25th newspaper, suddenly, a piece of news deeply attracted me, it told me: Shanghai will build a modern watch factory. I closed the newspaper and fell into deep thought. My body seemed to rise into the air, taking me to the place where I used to live - Shanghai! I seemed to see that factory, so beautiful, so quiet, which is more like a most beautiful and ideal villa than a factory. In this "villa", watches made by ourselves will be produced.
    Speaking of watches, I can immediately recite the names of many world-famous watches, such as Rolex, Omega, Simm, Tissot..., but in the department store counter, which watch is made by ourselves! How good it would be if we could make watches ourselves! Now, this ideal is about to be realized.
    I put down the bound volume of newspapers, and picked up the "People's Daily" on the second to last day of 1956, which published Chairman Mao's order on the issuance of the 1957 National Economic Construction Bonds. How much should I buy this year? I calculated and decided to buy 200 yuan of government bonds based on my financial situation.
    A message to the comrades who will be working in this watch factory: When you produce the first batch of domestically produced watches, please keep one to sell to me; for the past few years, I have bought government bonds with my savings, precisely to buy beautiful domestic industrial products, including a domestic watch!

    手表
    伯翔
    一提起公债，我总是那样地眉色飞舞。是的，几年来，我已经与公债结下了不解之缘！
    有时候，有人问我：“你买了这么些公债干吗？”我总要对他看半天，久久地说不出话来。确实，连我自己也不知道干什么！
    过去的生活我是记得很清楚的。解放前，为了争取生存的权利，幼年时期的我，不得不在生命线上挣扎。解放了，我和许许多多的青年一样，参加了革命，从此生活安定下来了。随着国家社会主义建设的发展，我的工资也逐步提高，除了自己的生活费用和寄给母亲一部分钱外，每月都可以余下来一笔钱。我要这些钱干什么呢？这个问题常常在我的脑海里翻腾不已，在没有找到答案以前，只好把钱存在银行里。
    生活在这个伟大的时代，祖国每日每时甚至每一秒钟都在发生着巨大的变化。想到祖国一日千里发展的形势，我深深地感到应该充分利用自己的生命，于是，我感到需要一只手表。有了表，就可以更好地掌握时间，充分利用时间。有时，我站在百货公司的玻璃柜台前面，看到一只只崭新的手表，心里不免为之一动。从那时起，我就把钱存起来，准备买一只心爱的表。
    存的钱一天天多起来，可以买一只表了；可是我没有买。我想，有了表是不是可以充分利用时间呢？未必是这样。没有表，虽然在某些方面有些不便，但照样可以充分利用时间，拿我来说，手表并不是多么迫切需要的。
    我很喜欢看电影。当我在银幕上看到融融的高炉倾倒出沸腾的钢水的时候，当一个新的纺织厂开动它的全部机器织出一匹匹彩色鲜艳的花布的时候，我的心情是多么的激动呵！我仿佛觉得我不是在电影院里，就在钢铁工人和纺织姑娘的身旁。建设一个新的钢铁工业基地需要多少钱呵！想到这里，我油然地产生了一种责任感：不仅应该好好地工作，而且应该以多余的钱帮助国家建设。一个新建的纺织厂开工生产一年，就可以收回全部的投资。资金周转得这样快，要是让国家来利用这笔钱该是多么好呵！想到这里，我心里是那样的兴奋，好像是几年来的问题找到了答案：是的，应该把多余的钱买公债！就在那一年，我把存在银行里的钱都买了公债，而给自己花了二十多块钱买了一只闹钟。
    从那以后，已经过去几年了。每一年，我总是把积存的钱都买了公债；直到现在，我手上还是光光的，家里也还是那只闹钟。
    一天，天正飘着雪花。我做完一天的工作回到家里，当我坐在小火炉旁烤火的时候，我感到我们的生活是多么幸福！我随手拿起去年10月份的“人民日报”合订本来，翻着翻着，在10月25日的报纸上，突然，有一条消息深深地吸引了我，它告诉我：上海将兴建一个现代化的手表制造厂。我阖上报纸，跌进深深的思潮里，身体仿佛凌空而起，把我带到我曾经生活过的地方——上海！我似乎看到了那个工厂，是那样的美丽，是那样的宁静，这与其说是一个工厂，还不如说是一座最漂亮最理想的别墅。就在这座“别墅”里，将要生产出我们自己制造的手表。
    提起手表，我立刻可以背出许许多多世界有名的表的名字，像罗莱克斯、亚米茄、西姆、天梭……，可是在百货公司的柜台里，有哪一种表是我们自己制造的呢！要是我们自己能制造出手表来，那该是多么好呢！现在，这个理想就要实现了。
    我放下报纸合订本，随手又拿起1956年倒数第二天的“人民日报”，上面刊载着毛主席颁布的关于发行1957年国家经济建设公债的命令。今年该买多少呢？我盘算了一下，根据自己的经济情况，决定买二百元公债。
    寄语将在这个手表制造厂里工作的同志们：当你们生产出第一批国产手表的时候，请你们留一只卖给我；几年来我把积存的钱都买了公债，正是为了买漂亮的国产工业品，其中也包括一只国产手表！
