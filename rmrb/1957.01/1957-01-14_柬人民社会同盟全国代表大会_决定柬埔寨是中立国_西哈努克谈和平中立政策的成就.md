Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 13th: The Fourth National Congress of the Cambodian People's Socialist Community opened on the 12th in the conference hall of the Royal Palace. At 8 o'clock, King Suramarit and the Queen came to address the congress. Subsequently, Prince Sihanouk delivered a general political report, followed by a lively debate.

Approximately four thousand people attended the congress, including individuals from outside the Community. This National Congress allowed other parties and ordinary people to express their opinions at the meeting. Foreign diplomatic envoys to Cambodia also attended the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 13th: The Fourth National Congress of the Cambodian People's Socialist Community yesterday passed a resolution, declaring "Cambodia is a neutral country."

The resolution stated, "Cambodia does not form any military or ideological alliance with other countries, and does not invade other countries. However, when Cambodia is invaded by another country, it reserves the right to self-defense and, if necessary, may request United Nations forces or the armies of friendly countries to repel the invading forces."

This resolution was made after heated discussions by the representatives. Prince Sihanouk, Chairman of the People's Socialist Community, repeatedly spoke at the congress to expound Cambodia's neutral policy. He said: Our neutral policy is a matter of national security. Cambodia cannot participate in the Southeast Asia military alliance. He said, "If we join a military alliance, the communists will resist us before we resist the communists."

He also said: "Cambodia's neutral policy should be legally announced internationally so that our neutral policy can be internationally guaranteed. Whoever invades Cambodia should be subject to international sanctions."

One representative asked whether Cambodia could also sign a treaty with Western countries to abide by the Five Principles. Sihanouk said that Western countries are unwilling to sign a treaty to abide by the Five Principles. Therefore, we can only make the neutral policy into law and require international recognition in the future, just as Austria recently declared its neutrality and requested Cambodia to recognize it.

Many representatives also unanimously requested in their speeches that the parliament should pass the neutral policy into law and base it on the Five Principles and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference.

Yesterday's conference also discussed issues such as amending the constitution and unanimously resolved to include the National Congress of the People's Socialist Community in the constitution; to determine the election procedures for provincial and Kyoto councilors; and to decide to continue using the name "Cambodia" and the "Three Towers" flag.

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 13th: In his political report at the Fourth National Congress of the People's Socialist Community on the 12th, Prince Sihanouk expounded the achievements of the Cambodian government's peaceful neutral policy.

Sihanouk said that he had made diplomatic visits to many countries with considerably different political systems and established friendships with these countries on a solid foundation. These countries respect Cambodia's independence and neutrality.

Moreover, the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia (especially the Soviet Union) have also agreed to provide Cambodia with unconditional technical and material assistance.

Sihanouk said that Cambodia has now achieved the normalization of relations with the two blocs, and they have agreed to meet peacefully on Cambodian soil and simultaneously help Cambodia improve the living standards of the Cambodian people.

Sihanouk continued, not only that, but Premier Zhou Enlai's recent visit, the establishment of various delegations, the implementation of aid methods from People's China and the Soviet Union, the improvement of Cambodia's relations with the United States, and the decision of this friendly great power to continue to assist our Cambodia (although Cambodia is pursuing a neutral policy), the continuous development of Cambodia's relations with France, all of this shows that, due to patience, sincerity, and courage, Cambodia has, if not playing a bridging role between the two blocs, at least provided favorable factors for their coexistence.

    柬人民社会同盟全国代表大会
    决定柬埔寨是中立国
    西哈努克谈和平中立政策的成就
    据新华社金边13日电　人民社会同盟第四届全国代表大会12日在王宫中的会议厅开幕。八时，苏拉玛里特国王和王后前来向大会致词。随后西哈努克亲王作了总的政治报告，接着进行了热烈的辩论。
    参加代表大会的约有四千人，其中有同盟以外的人士。这届全国代表大会准许其他党派和普通人在会上发表意见。各国驻柬埔寨的外交使节也参加了会议。
    据新华社金边13日电　柬埔寨人民社会同盟第四届全国代表大会昨天通过决议，确定“柬埔寨是中立国”。
    决议说，“柬埔寨不同其他国家结成任何军事上和意识形态上的联盟，不侵犯别国，但柬埔寨受到别国侵略时，保留自卫权，在必要时并可要求联合国军队或者友好国家军队击退侵略军。”
    这个决议是经过代表们进行热烈讨论后作出的。人民社会同盟主席西哈努克亲王在大会上曾经多次发言阐述柬埔寨的中立政策。他说：我们的中立政策是有关国家安全的问题。柬埔寨不能参加东南亚军事联盟。他说，“如果我们参加军事联盟，不是我们抵御共产党，共产党先抵御我们了。”
    他又说：“柬埔寨的中立政策应该向国际上作合法公布，这样做使我们的中立政策能得到国际保障，谁侵略柬埔寨就要受到国际制裁。”
    一位代表问道，柬埔寨是否也可以同样和西方国家订约遵守五项原则。西哈努克说，西方国家不愿意订约遵守五项原则。所以我们只能把中立政策通过成为法律，将来要求国际上公认，就像最近奥地利宣布中立后，要求柬埔寨予以承认一样。
    许多代表在发言中也一致要求国会应该通过中立政策成为法律，并且以五项原则和万隆会议的十项原则为根据。
    昨天的大会还讨论关于修改宪法等问题，并且一致决议把人民社会同盟全国代表大会列入宪法；确定省议员和京都议员的选举手续；并且决定仍然采用“柬埔寨”国名和“三塔”国旗。
    据新华社金边13日电　西哈努克亲王12日在人民社会同盟第四届全国代表大会上作的政治报告中，阐述了柬埔寨政府和平中立政策的成就。
    西哈努克说，他对政治制度相当不同的许多国家进行了外交访问，同这些国家在巩固的基础上建立了友谊。这些国家尊重柬埔寨的独立和中立。
    不仅如此，苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克（特别是苏联）还同意无条件地给予柬埔寨技术和物质援助。
    西哈努克说，现在柬埔寨已经做到了同两个集团关系的正常化，它们已经同意在柬埔寨国土上和平地会面，并且双方同时帮助柬埔寨提高柬埔寨人民的生活水平。
    西哈努克接着说，不仅如此，周恩来总理最近的访问，各种代表团的设立，人民中国和苏联援助办法的实施，柬埔寨同美国关系的改善以及这个友好的大国决定继续援助我们柬埔寨（虽然柬埔寨实行着中立政策），柬埔寨同法国的关系不断在发展，这一切表明，由于忍耐、诚意和勇气，柬埔寨已经做到在两个集团之间，如果说不是起着桥梁作用，也至少对它们的共处提供了有利的因素。
