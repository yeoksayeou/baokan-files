Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 23rd – The factories under the Shenyang First Bureau of Industry are mutually adjusting and fully utilizing idle equipment to overcome the equipment shortages of some factories. To date, the factories have adjusted and utilized 221 pieces of idle equipment. Shenyang Red Brick Factory No. 1 transferred an old lathe from another factory and established a repair team. Now, if a machine part in this factory fails, the repair team can immediately repair it, and it no longer needs to be taken to an outside factory for repair, thus avoiding work stoppages. The Shenyang Marble Factory and the Shenyang Litian Forging Factory transferred eight pieces of idle old equipment, which strengthened weak links, and greatly increased the production of marble and shovels.

To complete this year’s national production plan, the factories under this bureau of industry need to add 360 new pieces of equipment, but the higher authorities only allocated 61 pieces. To overcome the equipment shortage, the bureau of industry conducted a survey of idle equipment in each factory. According to the survey data from 78 factories, there are a total of more than 1,100 pieces of idle old equipment such as lathes, drilling machines, presses, and electric motors. After appraisal, more than 930 pieces of idle equipment can continue to be used for several years after being repaired or slightly repaired.

In the past, many factories did not pay enough attention to the management of idle equipment. Some factories placed idle equipment in the open air, exposed to wind and rain, causing the equipment to rust and become damaged; workers in some factories arbitrarily dismantled machine parts from idle equipment, making the equipment incomplete. Therefore, the First Bureau of Industry decided that several factories, such as the Shenyang Deyuhe Machine Repair Factory, should specialize in repairing idle equipment to facilitate mutual adjustment and full utilization. It also required all factories to take measures to attach importance to the management of idle equipment.

    沈阳第一工业局充分利用闲置设备
    新华社沈阳23日电　沈阳第一工业局所属工厂相互调剂和充分利用闲置设备，克服部分工厂设备不足的困难。到目前为止，各工厂调剂和动用的闲置设备已经有二百二十一台。沈阳市红砖一厂从别厂调剂来一台旧车床，成立了一个修理小组。现在，这个工厂的机件一旦发生故障，可以立刻由修理小组修理，不再停工拿到外厂修理了。沈阳市大理石厂、沈阳市力田锻造厂调剂来八台闲置旧设备，加强薄弱环节以后，大理石、铁锹的产量都大大增加。
    这个工业局所属各工厂为完成今年国家生产计划，需要增加三百六十台新设备，但是上级机关只拨给六十一台，为克服设备不足的困难，工业局对各工厂闲置设备进行了调查。据七十八个工厂的调查材料，闲置的车床、钻床、压力机和电动机等旧设备共计有一千一百多台。经过鉴定，有九百三十多台闲置设备不加修理或稍加修理以后，还可以继续使用好几年。
    许多工厂过去对于闲置设备的保管工作极不重视。有的工厂把闲置设备放在露天地里，风吹雨淋，使设备生锈损坏；有的工厂工人随意到闲置设备身上拆卸机件，使设备残缺不全。因此，第一工业局决定沈阳市德玉合机修厂等几家工厂专门修复闲置设备，以便相互调剂和充分利用，并且要求各工厂采取措施重视对闲置设备的保管工作。
