Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 24th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Shaoshan reports: In the first year of realizing agricultural cooperativization last year, more than 85% of agricultural co-ops in Liaoning Province increased production, and more than 80% of members increased their income. The remaining co-ops experienced no increase or decrease in production, or a decrease. So far, no co-op in the province has been found to have disintegrated. It is expected that co-ops that have not increased production will also be further consolidated and improved after the rectification work that is about to begin comprehensively.

The main characteristics of the successful operation of most agricultural co-ops in Liaoning Province are good internal management and sound labor organization, production responsibility systems, and financial systems. According to statistics from the Liaoning Provincial Department of Agriculture, 80% to 90% of the co-ops in the province have established and implemented scientific management systems such as "labor quotas," "contracting work to households and rewarding for exceeding production," "financial contracting," and "graded quotas and piece-rate payment." Many co-ops have also carried out unified planning for labor, land, and production. Due to the implementation of these systems, the labor enthusiasm of the members has been greatly stimulated. Last year, the labor utilization rate in the province increased by about 20% to 30% compared with 1955. In organizing and mobilizing members to participate in production work, the co-ops also carried out various forms of socialist labor emulation campaigns. Last spring, after fourteen famous large co-ops in the province initiated the emulation campaign, it received a wide response throughout the province. According to a survey of 7,290 co-ops in twenty-eight cities and counties, 5,720 co-ops also carried out labor emulation between teams and groups within the co-op.

Last year, Liaoning Province promptly overcame the extravagance and waste in agricultural co-ops and implemented the policy of running co-ops diligently and frugally. There are now more than 10,000 agricultural co-ops in the province, most of which were advanced co-ops expanded from small co-ops last year. Due to the larger scale of the co-ops and the lack of management experience in large co-ops, a chaotic situation once emerged in the initial stage. Many co-ops blindly launched basic construction, resulting in serious extravagance, waste, and ostentation. However, under the timely guidance and assistance of party and government leading organs at all levels, this chaotic situation was quickly reversed. After the joint directive of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on running co-ops diligently and frugally was issued in April, Liaoning Province conscientiously implemented it everywhere, re-examined the co-ops' financial expenditure plans, streamlined the co-ops' institutions, and reduced the number of management personnel within the co-ops who were detached from production. According to typical investigations by relevant departments, after re-examining the financial plans and reducing non-productive expenditures, the co-ops ensured that more than 60% of the total income was distributed to the members. At the same time, the tendency of many co-ops to specialize in a single product and neglect sideline production was also quickly changed, and diversified operations were carried out. More than 60% of the co-ops in the province ensured that the income of more than 90% of the members increased. The reason for this, in addition to increased agricultural production, was that sideline production was generally also very good. In Xingcheng County, the income from sideline production of the Tongyi Agricultural Co-op accounted for about half of the co-op's total income, and 99% of the members increased their income compared with before joining the co-op.

The implementation of the mass line's policy of democratic co-op management is also one of the important reasons for the successful operation of most agricultural co-ops in Liaoning Province. In these co-ops, the members' congress and the members' representative meeting can generally be convened on time. The leading cadres of the co-op constantly absorb the opinions of the members and improve the co-op's management work. The Yixian Hongguang Agricultural Co-op held a total of four members' congresses from the spring plowing to the autumn harvest last year; at each meeting, the members put forward many rationalization proposals and overcame the difficulties existing in the co-op at that time. For example, during the spring plowing, the members proposed to tap fertilizer sources from various aspects, which solved the problem of the whole co-op lacking manure fertilizer for more than 500 mu of land, and saved more than 5,000 yuan in expenses for buying chemical fertilizers.

    85％的社增加生产，80％的社员增加收入
    辽宁省农业社办得好
    主要特点是善于经营管理和坚持民主办社
    新华社沈阳24日电　新华社记者杨绍山报道：在去年实现农业合作化的头一年中，辽宁省85％以上的农业社增加了生产，80％以上的社员增加了收入。其余的社产量不增不减，或者减了产。到目前为止，全省还没有发现那一个社有散伙垮台的现象。预计没有增产的社经过即将全面开始的整顿工作，也能够得到进一步的巩固和提高。
    辽宁省大多数农业社办得很成功，主要的特点是社内的经营管理搞得好，劳动组织、生产责任制度、财务制度等都比较健全。据辽宁省农业厅统计，全省有80％到90％的社建立和实行了“劳动定额”、“包工包产、超产奖励”、“财务包干”和“分级定额、按件计酬”等科学的管理制度。许多社还进行了劳力、土地、生产的统一规划工作。由于这些制度的贯彻执行，大大发挥了社员的劳动积极性。去年全省劳动力利用率比1955年提高了20％到30％左右。各社在组织和发动社员参加生产工作中，还开展了不同形式的社会主义劳动竞赛运动。去年春天，全省十四个著名的大社倡议开展竞赛以后，在全省范围内得到了广泛的响应。据二十八个市、县七千二百九十个社的调查，有五千七百二十个社还开展了社内的队和队、组和组之间的劳动竞赛。
    去年辽宁省及时克服农业社的铺张浪费现象，贯彻了勤俭办社的方针。全省现有农业社一万多个，其中绝大部分是去年由小社扩并建成的高级社。由于社的规模较大，而且缺乏大社的经营管理经验，初期曾一度出现混乱局面。许多社盲目展开基本建设，铺张浪费、摆大摊子的现象很严重。但是，在各级党、政领导机关及时指导和帮助下，这种混乱局面很快就得到了扭转。4月间，中共中央和国务院关于勤俭办社的联合指示发布之后，辽宁省各地都认真地加以贯彻，重新审查了社的财务开支计划，精简了社的机构，减少了社内脱离生产的管理人员。据有关部门典型调查，各社在重新审查财务计划，削减非生产性开支以后，做到了把总收入的60％以上分配给社员。同时，许多社生产单一化、忽视副业生产的倾向也很快得到改变，开展了多种经营。全省有60％以上的社做到90％以上的社员增加收入，其原因除了农业增产以外，一般副业生产也搞得很好。兴城县同意农业社副业收入占全社总收入一半左右，99％的社员都比入社前增加了收入。
    群众路线的民主办社方针的贯彻，也是辽宁省大多数农业社办得成功的重要原因之一。在这些社中，社员大会和社员代表会议一般都能按时召开。社的领导干部随时吸收社员的意见，改进社的经营管理工作。义县红光农业社从去年春耕到秋收总共开了四次社员大会；每次会上，社员们都提出不少合理化建议，克服了当时社内存在的困难。如春耕中，社员们提议从多方面挖掘肥源，解决了全社缺少五百多亩地粪肥的问题，节省了五千多元买化学肥料的开支。
