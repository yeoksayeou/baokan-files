Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 25th - Seoul dispatch: The South Korean opposition Democratic Party's members of the National Assembly today proposed a "warning" to Syngman Rhee in the National Assembly, launching the fiercest attack against him in his nine years as president.

    In the proposal, Democratic Party members condemned Syngman Rhee for forcing the amendment of the constitution to enable his re-election as president; for "abusing the constitution and laws," and privately using the police to interfere in general and local elections in order to "maintain his own power forever." These assembly members pointed out that Syngman Rhee has turned South Korea into "a country of terror."

    The proposal also attacked Syngman Rhee's economic policies, arguing that they "were a failure except for a few privileged people," causing "the complete destruction of South Korea's national economy and people's livelihood."

    The South Korean National Assembly, where the Liberal Party holds a majority, rejected this "warning" proposal.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 26th - Seoul dispatch: The internal strife within Syngman Rhee's army is intensifying, centering around the assassination of Kim Chang-yong, the head of the Army Special Operations Unit. So far, more than ten generals and officers have been arrested in connection with this case, including Lieutenant General Kang Mun-bong, the former commander of the Second Army Group.

    Kang Mun-bong continued to deny any connection to the assassination of Kim Chang-yong in Syngman Rhee's military court on the 24th. He admitted that he "wanted to get rid of him (Kim Chang-yong) through legal means" because Kim Chang-yong ignored the command system; he and his subordinates abused their interrogation powers, greatly damaging the morale of the army; they used coercive means to illegally obtain military supplies and then sell them on the black market; Kim Chang-yong had made some unfounded false reports about senior generals to Syngman Rhee, and used false information to turn people against each other for his own benefit.

    After Kim Chang-yong was assassinated on January 30 last year, Heo Tae-young, the commander of the Seoul area of Rhee’s army was the first to be arrested after assassins pointed to him as mastermind of the assassination; Heo Tae-young was sentenced to death. When Heo Tae-young's death sentence was about to be carried out, his wife, Hwang Un-ha, accused Kang Mun-bong of being the mastermind of the assassination.

    In the interrogation on the 22nd and 23rd, Kang Mun-bong said that the accusation against him was a "well-planned and rehearsed play," and he knew about this plan even before he was arrested. He said that this was fabricated by the Army Special Operations Unit and his enemies in the army, including Army Chief of Staff Lee Hyung-geun. Hwang Un-ha's implication of him was instigated by the Army Special Operations Unit and others. Hwang Un-ha hoped to use this to exempt her husband from the death penalty.

    According to Heo Tae-young's confession, former Syngman Rhee's Army Chief of Staff Chung Il-kwon was also involved in the case. After Kim Chang-yong was assassinated, Chung Il-kwon was transferred to the powerless position of Joint Chiefs of Staff in June of last year.

    李承晚太专横受到猛烈攻击
    南朝鲜军队内部争权夺利倾轧愈烈
    据新华社平壤25日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜反对党民主党的国会议员今天在国会提出“警告”李承晚的提案，对李承晚进行了他当总统九年来最猛烈的一次攻击。
    民主党议员在提案中谴责李承晚强迫修改宪法，使自己重新当选总统；“滥用宪法和法律”，私自利用警察干涉普选和地方选举，以便“永远保持他自己的势力”。这些议员们指出，李承晚已经把南朝鲜变成“一个恐怖的国家”。
    这项提案还攻击了李承晚的经济政策，认为这种政策“除了对少数有特权的人外，是一个失败”，造成了南朝鲜“国民经济和人民生计的整个破坏”。
    自由党占多数的南朝鲜国会否决了的这项“警告”案。
    新华社平壤26日电　汉城消息：李承晚军队的内部倾轧，围绕着陆军特务部队长金昌龙被暗杀的案件愈演愈烈。到现在为止，因为这个案件而被捕的已经有前第二集团军司令姜文奉中将等将领和军官十多人。
    姜文奉24日在李承晚的军事法庭上继续否认他同暗杀金昌龙的事件有关。他承认他“想用合法的手段把他（金昌龙）赶走”，因为金昌龙不理睬指挥系统；他和他的部下并且滥用侦讯的权力，大大损害了军队的士气；他们用高压手段非法获得军需品，然后在黑市上出卖；金昌龙曾经向李承晚作过一些有关高级将领的毫无根据的假报告，并且利用假情报使人们互相反对来从中取利。
    金昌龙在去年1月30日被暗杀以后，首先是被刺客指为主谋人的李承晚陆军汉城地区兵事司令许泰荣等被捕，许泰荣并且被判处死刑。在许泰荣的死刑将要执行的时候，他的妻子黄云夏又控告姜文奉是暗杀事件的主谋人。
    姜文奉在22日和23日的审讯中说，对他的控告是一幕“计划周道、排练好了的戏”，甚至在他被捕以前他就知道了这个计划。他说，这是由陆军特务部队和他在陆军中的敌人捏造出来的，其中包括陆军参谋总长李亨根在内。黄云夏把他牵连进去，就是由陆军特务部队和其它一些人唆使的。黄云夏希望能借此免除她的丈夫的死刑。
    据许泰荣的口供，前任李承晚陆军参谋总长丁一权也和这一案件有关。在金昌龙被刺杀后，丁一权已经在去年6月被调任为有职无权的联合参谋总长。
