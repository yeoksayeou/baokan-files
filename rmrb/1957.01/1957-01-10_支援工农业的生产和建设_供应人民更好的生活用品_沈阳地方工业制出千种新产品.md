    Supporting Industrial and Agricultural Production and Construction; Supplying the People with Better Daily Necessities
    Shenyang Local Industry Produces a Thousand Kinds of New Products

    (Based on Shenyang Daily) This newspaper reports that according to incomplete statistics, Shenyang's local industries (including locally state-owned, joint state-private, and handicraft cooperative industrial enterprises) successfully trial-produced a total of 1,010 new products last year. They also improved and increased more than 4,600 new styles and specifications of products, strongly supporting socialist construction and helping the people improve their lives.

    Among the new products trial-produced, 195 kinds were supplied to industrial production, accounting for over 19%. These included corundum, hard alloy drill bits (for coal mining), snake skin hoses, manual bridge cranes, bleached rice straw pulp, tartaric acid, 1/10,000th-gram balances, and high-grade filter paper. Thirty-three kinds served agricultural production, accounting for over 3%. These included wooden waterwheels, hillside plows, threshing machines, grain hullers, granular fertilizer machines, tree planting machines, and soybean cake pulverizers. One hundred and twenty-seven kinds served basic construction, accounting for over 12%. These included blueprint paper, construction glass tubes, vibrators, machine-made hollow bricks, cinder tiles, and architectural models. Six hundred and sixteen kinds served people's livelihood and cultural and educational undertakings, accounting for over 60%. These included hanging gas lamps, baking soda, zipper galoshes, dried apples, champagne, Beijing-style "Eight Delicacies" pastries, dacron-collared shirts, convertible tables, new toys, science education models, and arts and crafts displays. In addition, new products accounting for over 3% of the total were needed by scientific research and other departments.

    Many of the new products successfully trial-produced last year were previously supplied by imports. The refractive glass trial-produced by the joint state-private Chengde Glass Factory was assessed by the Changchun Film Studio to have reached the level of Soviet imports in terms of luminosity and heat resistance, but the price was six times lower than that of imports. The blueprint paper successfully trial-produced by the joint state-private Tianxingheng Adhesive Paper Factory can print many drawings at once. According to staff at the Coal Mine Design Institute, using blueprint paper can help them save the working time of 200 drafters and greatly improve work efficiency. Some new products are welcomed by consumers because of their good quality and low price.

    On the other hand, facts show that there are still many shortcomings in the work of trial-producing new products in various enterprises. Some enterprises have not yet established a normal trial-production system and procedures, lack dedicated leadership, and sometimes prolong the trial-production period. Many of the new products successfully trial-produced last year were temporary orders, and preparations were not sufficient. Only a little over 100 kinds were included in the plan, lacking planning, so some new products that had been put into trial production were squeezed out midway. More seriously, some enterprises unilaterally pursue quantity in the trial production of new products while ignoring the timely supply to the market. Therefore, consumers react that it is all thunder and no rain, seeing trial-produced samples but not being able to buy them for a long time. These shortcomings need to be overcome this year.

    支援工农业的生产和建设　供应人民更好的生活用品
    沈阳地方工业制出千种新产品
    本报讯　据不完全统计，沈阳市地方工业（包括地方国营，公私合营、手工业合作社营工业企业）在去年一年里，共试制成功一千零十种新产品，改进与增加了四千六百多种新式样新规格的产品，有力地支援了社会主义建设和帮助人民改善生活。
    在试制的新产品中，供应工业生产的有金钢沙、硬质合金钻头（采煤用）、蛇皮管、手动桥式起重机、稻草漂白纸浆、酒石酸、万分之一天平、高级过滤纸等一百九十五种，占19％强；为农业生产服务的有木制水车、山地犁、打场机、脱谷机、颗粒肥料机、植树机、豆饼粉碎机等三十三种，占3％以上；为基本建设服务的有晒底纸、建筑玻璃管、震动器、机制空心砖、炉灰瓦、建筑模型等一百二十七种，占12％强；为人民生活和文化教育事业服务的有挂式瓦斯灯、小苏打、拉链胶鞋、苹果干、香槟酒、京式八件、胶领衬衣、三用桌、新玩具、科学教育模型以及工艺陈列品等六百十六种，占60％强。此外，还有占总数3％以上的新产品，是为科学研究等部门所需要的。
    在去年试制成功的新产品当中，有很多是过去靠进口供应的。公私合营成德玻璃厂试制的折射玻璃，经长春电影制片厂鉴定，光度和耐热能力达到了苏联进口货的水平，但售价却比进口货低六倍。公私合营天兴恒胶纸厂试制成功的晒底纸，一次可影印许多图纸，据煤矿设计院的工作人员谈，用晒底纸可以帮助他们节省二百名描图员的工作时间，并大大提高工作效率。有些新产品由于质量好、价格低，受到消费者的欢迎。
    另一方面事实表明，各企业的试制新产品工作也还存在许多缺点：一部分企业尚未建立起正常的试制制度和程序，缺乏专责领导，时而拖长试制期；去年试制成功的新产品，很多是临时订货，准备工作不充分，列入计划的只有一百多种，缺乏计划性，因而有些已投入试制的新产品中途被挤掉；较严重的是有的企业在试制新产品上片面追求数量，而忽视了对市场的及时供应，因此消费者反应干打雷不下雨，看到了试制样品，但迟迟买不到。这些缺点，是需要在今年加以克服的。　（据沈阳日报）
