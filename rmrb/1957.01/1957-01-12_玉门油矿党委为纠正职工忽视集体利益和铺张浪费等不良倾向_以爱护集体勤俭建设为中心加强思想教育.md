    Yumen Oil Mine Party Committee Strengthens Ideological Education Centered on Cherishing the Collective and Frugal Construction to Correct Unhealthy Tendencies Such as Employees Neglecting Collective Interests and Extravagant Waste

    (Our report) According to reports, the Yumen Oil Mine Party Committee recently decided to conduct a concentrated education among all employees, focusing on promoting the fine traditions of hard work, plain living, and frugal construction.

    According to the investigation by the Yumen Oil Mine Party Committee, some unhealthy tendencies have emerged among some employees. First, some people overemphasize personal interests in their work, while neglecting collective interests. For example, during the wage reform, many people made various unreasonable demands. When their demands were not met, they became passive and went on strike, cried and made trouble, or took long vacations. Some comrades who have newly joined the workforce feel that their job positions are not satisfactory and complain that the organization does not take care of their "future." Some individuals even refuse to go to work for a long time and refuse to accept work assignments. Among leaders at all levels and some employees, extravagance and a love of ostentation have become the norm. In capital construction and production, the phenomenon of wasting materials is also very serious. Now, even family members of laboring people from the countryside are unwilling to engage in labor. On the issue of unity, some employees are very arrogant and overbearing when interacting with comrades, full of arrogance, and incidents of fighting and brawling occur from time to time. In addition, there are also phenomena of moral corruption, violation of laws and regulations, non-compliance with social order, lack of concern for public property, and lax labor discipline.

    The reason for the emergence of the above-mentioned unhealthy tendencies is that Yumen Oil Mine has developed rapidly, and the number of new workers has increased sharply, bringing non-working-class ideas into the ranks of the workers. There are also some bad elements who have infiltrated the enterprise. At the same time, in the process of the oil mine's great development, many people have developed feelings of pride and complacency, believing that they have worked hard and deserve to enjoy themselves. More importantly, the leaders of this mine have underestimated the new problems and have not strengthened political and ideological work in a timely manner. The tendency to ignore politics has developed to some extent, and many leading cadres do not pay attention to the work of people, and often adopt simple and hasty methods when carrying out work. They consider problems more from a technical perspective and rarely consider political factors and political effects. This has led many party organizations to relax their political and ideological leadership in production. In the activities of the trade union, the Party, and the League, only plans, Party building, League building, etc. are discussed, and self-criticism is rarely carried out through organizational life to conduct self-education among employees.

    In order to correct the above-mentioned unhealthy tendencies, the Yumen Oil Mine Party Committee decided to conduct a concentrated education among all employees for a relatively long period, focusing on promoting the fine traditions of hard work, plain living, and frugal construction. It is necessary to advocate hard work, plain living, and love of labor; to advocate among leading cadres the style of sharing weal and woe with the masses; to conduct education on the subordination of personal interests to collective interests and the subordination of immediate interests to long-term interests, and to oppose the tendency to ignore politics; to conduct communist moral education, to advocate cherishing public property, abiding by labor discipline and public order, and to combine this with legal and disciplinary education; and to conduct systematic class education for Party members, probationary Party members, League members, and activists.

    In order to effectively strengthen the political and ideological education of employees, the Yumen Oil Mine Party Committee requires all cadres, Party members, League members, and activists to assume the responsibility of ideological education. Adopt various forms and use all possible opportunities to educate the masses, constantly publicize the Party's policies, and improve the political consciousness of the masses. Establish a system of workers' political classes and Party and League classes. Strengthen the group activities of the Party, the League, and the trade union, and ensure that the Party, the League, and the trade union can hold at least one group meeting each month for criticism and self-criticism and ideological mutual assistance.

    玉门油矿党委为纠正职工忽视集体利益和铺张浪费等不良倾向
    以爱护集体勤俭建设为中心加强思想教育
    本报讯　最近，玉门油矿党委决定在全矿职工中集中进行一次以发扬艰苦朴素、勤俭建设的优良传统为主要内容的教育。
    根据玉门油矿党委的调查，目前在部分职工中产生了一些不良倾向。首先是有些人在工作中过分强调个人利益，而忽视集体利益。如在工资改革中，不少人提出种种不合理的要求，当满足不了要求时，便消极怠工、大哭大闹、请长假。有些新参加工作的同志觉得工作岗位不称心时，就埋怨组织不照顾他的“前途”，个别人竟长期不上班，拒绝接受工作。在各级领导机关和部分职工中，讲阔气，喜排场已经成为风气。在基本建设和生产中，浪费器材的现象也很严重。现在连刚从农村来的劳动人民出身的家属，也不愿意从事劳动。在团结问题上，一部分职工和同志相处时，很不谦虚，盛气凌人，骄气十足，斗殴打架的事件也时有发生。另外，也发生道德败坏、违法乱纪、不遵守社会秩序、对公共财产不关心、劳动纪律松弛等现象。
    所以会产生上述不良倾向，是因为玉门油矿发展很快，新工人骤然增加，把非工人阶级思想带到工人队伍里来了。也还有个别坏分子混进了企业。同时，在油矿大发展的过程中，不少人增长了骄傲自满情绪，认为自己劳苦功高，应该享受一下。而更重要的是这个矿的领导人员对新问题估计不足，没有及时加强政治思想工作。不问政治的倾向有所发展，许多领导干部不注意作人的工作，在进行工作时往往采取简单急躁的办法，看问题时从技术角度考虑多，不去或很少考虑政治因素和政治效果。这样就使得不少党组织放松了生产中的政治思想领导。在工会、党、团的活动中，只讨论计划、建党、建团等，则很少通过组织生活来展开批评与自我批评，进行职工的自我教育。
    为纠正上述不良倾向，玉门油矿党委决定，在一个较长的时期内，向全体职工集中进行以发扬艰苦朴素、勤俭建设的优良传统为主要内容的教育。提倡艰苦朴素，热爱劳动；在领导干部中提倡与群众共甘苦的作风；进行个人利益服从集体利益、眼前利益服从长远利益的教育，反对不问政治的倾向；进行共产主义道德教育，提倡爱护公共财物，遵守劳动纪律与公共秩序，结合进行法纪教育；向党员、预备党员、团员和积极分子进行系统的阶级教育。
    为切实加强对职工的政治思想教育工作，玉门油矿党委要求全体干部、党、团员和积极分子们都担负起思想教育工作的责任。采取多种多样形式，利用一切可能利用的机会向群众进行教育，随时宣传党的政策，提高群众政治觉悟。建立工人政治课和党团课制度。加强党、团与工会的小组活动，保证党、团与工会每月至少能召开一次小组会用作开展批评与自我批评，进行思想互助。　（据甘肃日报）
