Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 4th—According to Antara News Agency: Lieutenant Colonel Wahab Makmur, commander of the Second Infantry Regiment of the First Military Region, has already handed over the command of the First Military Region, which he had once taken over, to Lieutenant Colonel Djanting, the commander of the First Military Region, on the 3rd. This handover was presided over by Colonel Subroto, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Army.

After Simbolon launched the rebellion, President Sukarno ordered Djanting, the former Chief of Staff of the First Military Region, to take over as commander of the First Military Region. When Djanting was unable to take over, Makmur took over. Makmur had already taken measures to take over as commander of the First Military Region two days before Djanting drove Simbolon away. Now Makmur has expressed his acceptance of Djanting's leadership.

However, the relationship between two regiments in North Sumatra and the commander of the First Military Region remains to be resolved. Gaharu, commander of the First Infantry Regiment stationed in Aceh, and Samosir, commander of the Third Infantry Regiment stationed in Tarutung, have both announced that they do not recognize the leadership of the commander of the First Military Region and are only subject to the leadership of the Supreme Commander and the Army Chief of Staff.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 4th—According to the Medan "Patriot Newspaper," quoting Medan official sources, former First Military Region Commander Simbolon has contacted the American Mobil Oil Company in northern Sumatra, requesting assistance in fleeing abroad. Simbolon is still hiding in Tarutung, the location of the headquarters of the Third Regiment of the First Military Region, north of Tarutung, North Sumatra.

The commander of the First Military Region has ordered the Third Regiment to hand over Simbolon.

    京廷中校正式接管第一军区
    西姆波朗要美孚油公司帮他逃到外国
    新华社雅加达4日电　据安塔拉通讯社讯：第一军区第二步兵团团长瓦哈布·马克慕尔中校已经在3日把他一度接管的第一军区司令的职权交给第一军区司令京廷中校。这个交接工作是在印度尼西亚陆军副参谋长苏布罗图上校主持下进行的。
    在西姆波朗发动叛变以后，苏加诺总统曾经下令前第一军区参谋长京廷接任第一军区司令职务，在京廷无法接任时，由马克慕尔接任。在京廷赶走西姆波朗之前两天，马克慕尔已经采取了接任第一军区司令的措施。现在马克慕尔已经表示接受京廷的领导。
    但是，在北苏门答腊还有两个团同第一军区司令间的关系尚待解决。驻在亚齐的第一步兵团团长加哈鲁和驻在打板奴里的第三步兵团团长沙莫西尔都宣布不承认第一军区司令的领导，只受最高统帅和陆军参谋长的领导。
    据新华社雅加达4日电　据棉兰“爱国者报”从棉兰官方人士得到消息说，前第一军区司令西姆波朗已经和苏门答腊北部的美国美孚油公司联系，要求帮助他逃到外国去。西姆波朗现在还藏在北苏门答腊打板奴里北部的第一军区第三团司令部所在地的打鲁栋。
    第一军区司令已命令第三团把西姆波朗交出来。
