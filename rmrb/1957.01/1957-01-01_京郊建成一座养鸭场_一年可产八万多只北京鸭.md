    A Duck Farm Built in the Suburbs of Beijing
    Producing Over 80,000 Beijing Ducks Annually
    (Our Newspaper) A state-owned duck farm for centralized breeding and large-scale production of Beijing Peking ducks was completed at the end of 1956 on the banks of the Liangshui River in the southern suburbs of the capital. The entire farm is now officially in production.
    This is currently the largest duck farm in our country for centralized breeding of Beijing Peking ducks, covering an area of more than one hundred mu, with over three hundred duck houses, raising more than ten thousand ducks of various sizes. The entire Peking duck production, from breeding, laying eggs, hatching, fattening, to force-feeding finished products and processing and slaughtering, is completed here.
    Based on the existing equipment conditions of this farm, the annual output can reach more than 80,000 ducks. Starting from January 1957, the Beijing Peking ducks produced by this farm will be supplied to the people of the capital. (Tang Xinggeng)

    京郊建成一座养鸭场
    一年可产八万多只北京鸭
    本报讯　一座集中饲养、大量生产北京填鸭的国营养鸭场，已经于1956年末在首都南郊凉水河畔建成。现在全场已正式投入生产。
    这是我国目前集中饲养北京填鸭的最大的一座养鸭场，共占地一百多亩，有鸭舍三百余间，饲养着大、小鸭子一万多只。整个填鸭生产，从育种、产卵、孵化、育肥，到填喂成品和加工屠宰等工作，都在这里完成。
    根据这个场的现有设备条件，年产量可达到八万只以上。从1957年1月开始，这个场生产的北京填鸭，就要供应首都人民了。（唐兴赓）
