Xinhua News Agency, January 28th – The campaign to support the government and cherish the people by the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Beijing is deepening. In recent days, troops stationed in various districts of Beijing have generally invited representatives from local Party and government organs and various sectors of the people to hold discussion meetings to solicit opinions. On the 24th, troops stationed in Daliubukou held a joint army-civilian symposium. In a cordial atmosphere, they put forward some criticisms and suggestions to each other, and decided to hold such army-civilian heart-to-heart talks frequently in the future to further strengthen army-government and army-civilian relations.

The visiting activities of the troops stationed in various districts have in recent days penetrated into factories, schools, agricultural production cooperatives, street offices, as well as the homes of revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, and street residents. Troops stationed in the Nanyuan District are adopting the method of dividing areas of responsibility to visit local residents, inspect mass discipline, and solicit opinions on the troops. They are also inviting leaders of nearby factories and agricultural production cooperatives to give reports to the troops. On the 23rd, troops stationed in the Xidan District dispatched male and female officers to visit neighbors near their station. During the visits, people from all districts praised the troops for their concern for the people, their active support for municipal construction, and their humble virtue of giving priority to the people in allocating New Year goods. Farmers in the suburbs also universally thanked the troops for helping them with production.

At present, joint army-civilian celebration activities in various districts of Beijing are unfolding widely in various forms. Tonight, the General Political Department's Cultural Troupe will present the Soviet drama "Dania" for the first time for the people of the Xisi District. The army and people of the Xidan District celebrated together with singing and dancing until late at night on the 26th. In addition, some troop units have organized congratulatory teams to extend New Year greetings to local Party and government organs and people from all walks of life during the Spring Festival.

    新华社28日讯　中国人民解放军驻北京各部队的拥政爱民活动正在深入展开。连日来，北京市各区驻军都普遍邀请当地党、政机关和各界人民代表举行座谈会，征求意见。24日，大六部口某部驻军举行了军民座谈会，在亲切的气氛中相互提出了一些批评和建议，并且决定今后要常开这样的军民谈心会，以便进一步密切军政、军民关系。
    各区驻军的访问活动这几天已经深入到工厂、学校、农业生产合作社、街道办事处以及烈属、军属和街道居民的家里。南苑区驻军正在采取分区包干的办法访问驻地居民，检查群众纪律和征求对部队的意见，并且邀请附近的工厂、农业生产合作社的领导人向部队作报告。西单区驻军23日就派出男女军官访问了驻地附近的邻居。在访问中，各区人民都盛赞驻军关怀人民、积极支援市政建设和把年货优先让给人民的谦让美德，郊区农民还普遍感谢驻军帮助他们生产。
    目前，北京市各区的军民联欢活动正在以多种多样的形式广泛展开。今晚，总政文工团演出的苏联名剧“达尼娅”首次为西四区人民献演。西单区军民在26日晚歌舞联欢到深夜。此外，有些部队单位还组织贺节队，准备春节期间向驻地党、政机关和各界人民贺年。
