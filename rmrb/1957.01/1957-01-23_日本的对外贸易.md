Japan's foreign trade saw rapid growth in 1956, along with the increase in productivity.

According to estimates by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry: If the production index of 1950 is taken as 100, the overall industrial index for 1956 will reach 249.4%. In terms of trade, according to the "Asahi Shimbun", Japan's trade exports have increased by an average of about 400 million US dollars per year since 1952. The export volume in 1955 was 2.01 billion US dollars, an increase of 23% compared to 1954; according to statistics from the Ministry of Finance, the export volume in 1956 reached 2.5 billion US dollars, an increase of 24.4% compared to 1955, setting a post-war record high.

The reason for Japan's economic development is that Japanese monopoly capital accumulated a large amount of capital and obtained huge profits through US military orders during the Korean War, through the annexation of small and medium-sized enterprises using the "tight monetary policy" since 1954, and through the exploitation of the working class via labor productivity improvement campaigns. This has continuously renewed and expanded production equipment, thereby strengthening production and export capabilities.

The rapid increase in Japan's foreign exports shows that Japan has regained its competitive strength in the international capitalist market. This can be clearly seen from its trade activities in the Sterling Area. Since 1954, Japan's exports to the Sterling Area have increased significantly. Japanese goods have been very active in markets such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Burma, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, New Zealand, Australia, British Africa, and Argentina. Among them, Japan's exports to India have increased from 43.86 million US dollars in 1954 to 84.73 million US dollars in 1955, and reached 46.835 million US dollars in the first half of 1956; exports to British Africa have increased from 45.98 million US dollars in 1954 to 83 million US dollars in 1955, and reached 39.79 million US dollars in the first half of 1956.

In recent years, Japan's capital exports to Asia and Latin America have also become active. According to data from the Foreign Exchange Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Finance: as of August 1956, Japan had 44 investments in Asia, totaling 10.225 million US dollars; and 29 investments in Latin America, totaling 9.521 million US dollars. Japan is also planning to further strengthen investment in these regions through technical assistance and the provision of equipment. Therefore, Japanese newspapers now rarely talk about "Japan-US joint development of Southeast Asia" or Japan-US joint development of backward areas. Instead, they talk more about how to strengthen joint development of mines and factories with countries such as India, Burma, Thailand, Ceylon, and the Philippines, and how to jointly run the Minas steel plant in Brazil with an annual output of 400,000 tons of steel. This can be understood as Japan beginning to demand equal opportunities with the United States and the United Kingdom in Southeast Asia and other regions.

After the war, Japan has always regarded Southeast Asia and Latin America as its main markets. As countries in these regions have been developing national industries recently, it has affected the content of Japan's exports. Before the war, cotton textiles accounted for 50% of Japan's total exports, while metals only accounted for 7% and machinery only accounted for 8%. However, from the export content between January and October 1956, textiles accounted for 34%, metals accounted for 14%, and machinery accounted for 18%. In order to strengthen exports to these regions, Japan has continuously updated and expanded production equipment in recent years. The focus of investment is on basic industries such as shipbuilding, machinery manufacturing, steel, metals, electricity, and shipping, as well as the chemical industry. According to a survey by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, among 978 companies, investments in expanding equipment in 1956 may reach 473.7 billion yen, an increase of 20% compared to 1955, a two-fold increase compared to 1951, and 80 billion yen more than 1953, which was known as the highest investment record after the war.

As is well known, Japan is a country with a high level of industrialization but lacks domestic raw materials and has a narrow market. Under the constraints of the US embargo policy, Japan regards the Southeast Asian and Latin American markets as its economic lifeline. The problem today is whether the rapidly expanding industrial equipment, productivity, and export volume can be resolved in these two markets.

According to the "Asahi Shimbun", the Japanese government estimates that the trade volume in 1957 will only reach 2.62 billion US dollars, an increase of only 6% compared to 1956. This raises the question of whether the export volume in 1957 can match the production equipment and productivity that suddenly expanded in 1956.

From many perspectives, it is not easy for Japan to enter the Southeast Asian market on a large scale. Although this region accounts for half of the world's population, the market is extremely small due to the long-term cruel exploitation by imperialism and the long-standing economic power of countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. In recent years, competition has become more intense due to the entry of countries such as West Germany and Belgium. Therefore, although Japan has used great efforts in recent years, its investment in Southeast Asia is only over 10 million US dollars, while the US investment in Asia is 600 million US dollars, and the UK investment in Indian industrialization is over 700 million US dollars. The difference in strength is vast. In terms of trade, although Japan's exports to Southeast Asia in 1956 were almost the same as the 480 million US dollars in 1955, its proportion in Japan's total exports has dropped from 27% in 1955 to 20% in 1956. This shows that exports to Southeast Asia have slowed down.

Looking at the Latin American market. This region was originally a traditional market for countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. After the war, the United States squeezed in, making the competition very fierce. From the perspective of capital export, the United States invested in the oil industry after the war. After 1950, the scope of investment expanded to manufacturing and mining. By 1953, the US investment in Latin America had reached 6 billion US dollars, accounting for 60% of US overseas investment. Recently, the World Bank and the US Export-Import Bank have also exported capital to this region in the form of loans, reaching 400 to 500 million US dollars annually. It can be said that, so far, the main economic sectors of Latin American countries are under the control of US capital. The United Kingdom, West Germany, France, and other countries are making various efforts to restore their traditional markets. For example, West Germany's industrial circles have formed a "Brazil Five-Year Plan Investigation Group" to study development and investment issues; France is also planning to provide Brazil with equipment for hydroelectric power generation, essential oil, dockyards, cement, chemical products, and copper factories; the United Kingdom is preparing to establish a motorcycle factory in Brazil; Italy is planning to establish a machinery factory in Mexico, etc. In the context of the absolute advantage of the United States and the sharp struggle between the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, Italy and other countries attempting to restore their traditional markets, Japan's capital exports in this region have been greatly hindered. From the perspective of trade exports, compared with the United States' exports to Latin America accounting for 41% of the region's total imports and Western European countries accounting for 29%, Japan only accounts for 3% to 4%, which is an insignificant figure. But this does not mean that Japan cannot expand trade or export capital to Latin America in the future, but from the overall situation, the extent of expansion is considerably limited.

What about Japan's exports to the United States? On the one hand, the United States prohibits Japan from expanding trade with its close neighbor China, and on the other hand, it restricts Japan's exports to the United States in every possible way. The recent deadlock in negotiations on textile trade between the US and Japan illustrates the contradiction between restriction and counter-restriction. Today, Japan's exports to the United States have fallen from 6% of US imports before the war to 3.8%, while the United States' exports to Japan average 30% of Japan's imports each year.

Today, the problems existing in the Japanese economy are not only market problems. Domestically, there are also problems such as insufficient raw materials, steel, electricity, and transportation capacity resulting from the expansion of production equipment, especially the problem of raw materials. Japanese monopoly capitalists have begun to worry about this.

Starting from such an economic background, since the spring of 1956, Japanese big capitalists have begun to attach importance to Japan-China and Japan-Soviet trade, which shows that they are more eager for the markets and raw materials of China and the Soviet Union. The Japan-China Export-Import Association, which reflects the intentions of the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry and big capitalists, recently formulated a "Summary of Prospects for Japan-China Trade from 1958-1962". According to this plan, by 1962, Japan's trade export and import volume with China will each reach 526 million US dollars, which is 19 times the export volume and 6 times the import volume in 1955. At the same time, Japan-Soviet trade may reach 250 million US dollars within five years. However, all these beautiful prospects depend on whether Japan can get rid of the US embargo policy and implement independent foreign trade.

    日本的对外贸易
    吴学文
    1956年日本对外贸易随着生产力的提高有了迅速增长。
    据日本通商产业省估计：如以1950年的生产指数为一百，1956年的产业总合将达到249.4％。在贸易方面，据“朝日新闻”报道：从1952年起，日本的贸易输出额每年平均增加四亿美元左右。1955年的输出额是二十亿一千万美元，比1954年增加了23％；据大藏省的统计，1956年的输出额达到二十五亿美元比1955年增加24.4％，创战后的最高纪录。
    日本经济所以能够发展，是因为日本的垄断资本在通过朝鲜战争期间的美国军事订货，通过1954年以来的“紧缩金融”政策对中小企业的吞并，通过提高劳动生产率运动对工人阶级的掠夺等，集累了大量资本，获得了庞大利润，不断更新和扩充了生产设备，从而加强了生产和对外输出的力量。
    日本对外输出的迅速增加，说明日本已经恢复了在资本主义国际市场上的竞争力量。这可以从它在英镑区的贸易活动中清楚地看出来。从1954年起，日本向英镑区的输出额有显著的增加。在香港、新加坡、缅甸、印度、巴基斯坦、锡兰、新西兰、澳大利亚、英属非洲和阿根廷等市场上，日本商品显得非常活跃。其中如日本对印度的输出额，已从1954年的四千三百八十六万美元增至1955年的八千四百七十三万美元，而1956年上半年已达到四千六百八十三万五千美元；对英属非洲的输出额，已从1954年的四千五百九十八万美元增至1955年的八千三百万美元，而1956年上半年已达到三千九百七十九万美元。
    日本对亚洲和拉丁美洲地区的资本输出，近年来也开始活跃起来。据日本大藏省外汇局资料称：到1956年8月为止，日本在亚洲的投资有四十四件，计一千零二十二万五千美元；在拉丁美洲的投资有二十九件，计九百五十二万一千美元。日本还在计划通过技术援助和提供装备等方式进一步加强对这些地区的投资。因此，日本报刊上现在很少再谈“日美共同开发东南亚”、日美共同开发落后地区的问题，而谈得多的是如何加强日本和印度、缅甸、泰国、锡兰、菲律宾等国共同开发矿山和开办工厂，如何同巴西合办年产四十万吨钢材的米纳斯制钢厂等问题了。这可以理解为日本已经开始在东南亚等地区向美、英等国要求机会均等。
    战后，日本一直把东南亚和拉丁美洲看成是他的主要市场。由于这些地区的国家近来都在发展民族工业，因而影响了日本的输出内容。战前，在日本的输出总额中有50％是棉纺品，金属只占7％，机器只占8％。但从1956年1月至10月间的输出内容来看，纤维品占34％，金属占14％，机器占18％。日本为了加强对这些地区的输出，几年来不断的更新和扩充了生产设备。投资的重点是造船、机器制造、钢铁、金属、电力和海运等基础工业和化学工业部门。据通商产业省调查，在九百七十八个公司中，1956年内用在扩充设备上的投资可能达到四千七百三十七亿日元，比1955年增加20％，比1951年增加了二倍，比被称为战后投资最高纪录的1953年还多了八百亿日元。
    如所周知，日本是个有高度工业水平但国内缺乏原料和市场狭小的国家。在美国禁运政策的束缚下，日本把东南亚和拉丁美洲市场看成是它的经济生命线。今天的问题是迅速扩张起来的工业设备、生产力和输出量是否能在这两个市场上求得解决。
    据“朝日新闻”报道：日本政府估计1957年的贸易额只能达到二十六亿二千万美元，仅比1956年增加6％。这里就发生了1957年的输出额和1956年突然扩张起来的生产设备和生产力是否能相适应的问题。
    从许多条件来看，日本想大举进入东南亚市场并非容易。这个地区虽然人口占世界的一半，但因长年来受到帝国主义的残酷剥削以及英、美等国家的经济势力盘踞已久，所以市场极为狭小。近年来，由于西德和比利时等国的进入，显得竞争更加剧烈。因此，几年来日本虽然用了很大力量，但在东南亚的投资也只不过是一千多万美元，而美国在亚洲的投资是六亿美元，英国在印度工业化的投资计七亿美元以上，力量相差悬殊。在贸易方面，1956年日本对东南亚的输出额虽然和1955年的四亿八千万美元相差无几，但从它在日本全部输出额中的比重来看，已从1955年的27％，降至1956年的20％。这说明向东南亚的输出出现了迟钝现象。
    再看拉丁美洲的市场。这个地区本来是英、德、法等国的传统市场，战后美国又挤了进来，竞争得十分剧烈。从资本输出来看，美国在战后便向石油业投资，1950年以后，投资的范围扩充到制造业和矿业等部门。到1953年，美国向拉丁美洲的投资已达六十亿美元，占美国海外投资的60％。最近，世界银行和美国输出入银行又以借款方式向这个地区输出资本，每年将达四、五亿美元。可以说，到目前为止，拉丁美洲诸国的主要经济部门是在美国资本的控制之下。英、西德、法等国，为了挽回它们传统的市场，正在多方努力。如西德的产业界已组成“巴西五年计划调查团”，着手研究开发与投资问题；法国也在计划向巴西提供水力发电、精油、船坞、水泥、化学制品、铜等工厂的设备；英国准备在巴西设立摩托车工场；意大利计划在墨西哥设立机器工厂等。在美国的绝对优势和英、法、西德、意等企图挽回传统市场而进行了尖锐斗争的情况下，日本在这个地区的资本输出，受到了很大阻力。从贸易输出上来看，和美国向拉丁美洲的输出占这个地区全部输入额的41％、西欧国家占29％相比，日本只占3％—4％，是个微不足道的数字。但这并不是说，日本今后向拉丁美洲就不能扩大贸易或输出资本了，只是从整个形势来看，扩大的程度是受到相当的限制的。
    日本向美国的输出又怎样？美国一方面禁止日本和它的近邻中国扩大贸易，同时又百般限制日本向美国的输出。最近美日间在纺织品贸易上的谈判呈现僵局，就说明了限制与反限制的矛盾。今天，日本向美国的输出已从战前占美国输入额的6％降至3.8％，而美国向日本的输出平均每年占日本输入额的30％。
    今天，在日本经济中存在的问题，不仅是市场问题。在国内，还有随着扩充生产设备而来的原料、钢材、电力、运输力等不足的问题，其中尤其紧张的是原料问题。日本的垄断资本家已经开始为此大伤脑筋。
    从这样一个经济背景出发，1956年春天以来，日本的大资本家对日中、日苏贸易开始重视，这表明他们对中、苏的市场和原料更加渴望。反映日本通商产业省和大资本家意图的日中输出入协会，最近制定了一个“从1958—1962年日中贸易展望概要”。根据这个计划，到1962年，日本对中国的贸易输出入额将各达五亿二千六百万美元，为1955年输出额的十九倍、输入额的六倍。同时，日苏贸易也可能在五年之内达到二亿五千万美元。但是，所有这些美好的前景，都要看日本是否能摆脱美国的禁运政策，实行自主的对外贸易而定。
