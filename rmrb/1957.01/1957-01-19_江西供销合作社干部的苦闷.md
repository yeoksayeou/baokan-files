    The Distress of Jiangxi Supply and Marketing Cooperative Cadres

    Some Party and government organs in Jiangxi Province have turned the supply and marketing cooperatives into their "treasure chests," arbitrarily demanding money and personnel from the cooperatives, causing great difficulties in the business management of the cooperatives. For example, the wages of two correspondents from the CPC Dayu County Committee and one correspondent from the CPC Taihe County Committee are paid by the local county supply and marketing cooperatives. After the CPC Nanchang Prefectural Committee transferred two cadres from the Nanchang Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative office in November 1954, the supply and marketing cooperative has continued to pay the wages and various public expenses of these two cadres to this day. The CPC Fuliang County Committee even decided that the wages of cooks in credit cooperatives and township people's committees should be borne by the supply and marketing cooperatives. Most strangely, when Fuliang County needed money to build an auditorium, the county committee demanded that the Fuliang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative deduct a portion of money from the peasants when purchasing firewood to hand over to the county committee for the construction of the auditorium. Before the funds were fully deducted, the county committee took the supply and marketing cooperative's deposits from the People's Bank.

    The practice of frequently drawing supply and marketing cooperative cadres to engage in "central work" is also very common. In the Shangrao Special District, as many as 785 supply and marketing cooperative cadres were drawn to engage in agricultural cooperative work and anti-rebellion work. The No. 2 District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Ruichang County in Jiujiang Special District was once drawn so empty that it had to suspend business for three days. The CPC Ruichang County Committee, due to the construction of houses, also transferred two skilled business personnel from the supply and marketing cooperative to act as purchasing agents for building materials, which greatly affected the business of the supply and marketing cooperative.

    These phenomena have made many supply and marketing cooperative cadres in Jiangxi Province feel very distressed: the county committee's decisions must of course be implemented; implementing these decisions, in turn, affects the implementation of the economic accounting system within the supply and marketing cooperative. The worst thing is that when people are drawn away, there is no one to do the work of the supply and marketing cooperative, and the business is greatly affected. Therefore, it is hoped that the relevant departments in Jiangxi Province will quickly correct this phenomenon.

### 江西供销合作社干部的苦闷

    江西供销合作社干部的苦闷
    江西省一些党政机关，把供销社当成了他们的“百宝箱”，随便向供销社要钱、要人，使供销社在经营管理上发生很大困难。如中共大庾县委会的两名通讯员、泰和县委会的一名通讯员的工资，都是由当地县供销社支付的。中共南昌地委会在1954年11月把南昌专区供销社办事处的两个干部抽调走后，至今还由供销社支付这两个干部的工资和各项公杂费用。中共浮梁县委会就曾决定：信用合作社、乡人民委员会等单位炊事员的工资，由供销社负担。最奇怪的是浮梁县要修盖礼堂没有钱，县委会就要浮梁县供销社在收购木柴时，扣农民的一部分钱来交给县委会修建礼堂，没等把款扣足，县委会就从人民银行里把供销社的存款拿走。
    供销社的干部经常被抽去搞“中心工作”也是很普遍的。上饶专区抽调供销社干部去搞农业社工作和肃反工作的，即达七百八十五人。九江专区瑞昌县二区供销社曾被抽得不留一人而停止营业三天。中共瑞昌县委会因修建房屋，也抽调供销社两个熟练的业务人员去充当购买材料的采购员，使供销社的业务受到很大影响。
    这些现象使江西省内许多供销合作社干部都感到很苦闷：县委的决定当然要执行；执行了这些决定，又影响到供销社内经济核算制的贯彻。最糟糕的是人被抽走了，供销社的工作没有人搞，业务受到很大影响。因此，希望江西省的有关部门迅速纠正这种现象。		　　郝广成
