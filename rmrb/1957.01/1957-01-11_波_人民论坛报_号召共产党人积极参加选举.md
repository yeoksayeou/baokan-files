Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 8th: The "People's Tribune" published an editorial on the 7th entitled "Communists March to the Forefront of the Election Struggle."

The editorial stated: "The general election is only two weeks away, and the election campaign should be developing to its climax. Many meetings and candidate meetings with voters have been held throughout Poland, but party organizations and many party activists have not actively participated in the election campaign, and the party has not been able to mobilize all party members to join the election campaign."

The editorial pointed out, "We are not people who only talk the talk, we just want to tell the truth to the masses. We don't want to buy votes. We want to strengthen national sovereignty, expand democracy in our social and national life, and build socialism according to the characteristics of the Polish nation, thereby improving people's living standards as quickly as possible. But this requires labor and time. Members of the Polish United Workers' Party can tell society and voters clearly: the facts of the two months since October have proved that our words and deeds are consistent. So why haven't party organizations and many party members actively joined the battle? It is clear that the main responsibility lies with the party leadership and the Central Consultative Body for launching the propaganda work too late, and to this day has not issued enough propaganda materials. Our 'People's Tribune' is not without responsibility either. The reason why we have not carried out the election propaganda well is also due to other reasons, that is, some communists are depressed, some have lost their direction, and some are complacent because of the achievements of October. Many party organizations showed great enthusiasm before and after October, but more than once weakened afterward, and personal disputes occurred, which were detrimental to the party's political activities during the election. Without political struggle, the election will not be won by itself."

The democratization of political life and free elections stipulated by the election law are being used by the enemies of socialism to achieve their own goals. At the beginning of the election campaign, we had facts to prove that the vicious enemies of socialism tried to sneak into the list of candidates for deputies of the National Unity Front. The enemy is not sleeping, this is not empty talk, but a fact. Therefore, although all the healthy forces of the people of the whole country are on our side, we still cannot rest easy. Now the enemy has started another activity. The enemy slanders our candidates, attacks our candidates with the dirtiest tricks, and tries to make the party member candidates lose the election. In some places, there are shouts against the central candidates. Some people holding party membership cards also issue such shouts. It should be made clear that the party cannot tolerate such hostile behavior against the leadership, against the party, against the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, and against Polish October, regardless of what they are disguised as, and regardless of their motives for opposing the party and opposing the central candidates. Because they are disgusted with socialism. Our party organizations and all party members should be keenly aware of this. We must make it clear to the voters that Poland cannot move towards capitalism or return to the past."

The editorial finally called on the whole party to fully mobilize, fully carry out election activities together with the members of the National Unity Front, expose and eliminate the activities of the enemy, and fully unite to win the election victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 9th: The "People's Tribune" published an article yesterday by Bolesław Wojciechowski entitled: "January 20 in Poland and Abroad." The article said that all over the world, our friends and the enemies of socialism and Poland are closely watching the results of the parliamentary elections to be held on January 20. On this day, the Polish public will undergo another test of their unity and political maturity. The parliamentary elections can and should consolidate socialist democracy and stabilize the domestic situation, thereby strengthening European peace and the socialist camp, which requires people to answer the plots of those who disrupt the elections and oppose the candidates of the United Workers' Party with their voting actions. Poland's international prestige also depends on January 20. It is clear that the victory of the National Unity Front will increase the real possibility of successfully solving our country's economic difficulties, both in terms of domestic and international cooperation.

The article continued, "Any idea of ​​Poland having a special 'mission' within the socialist camp is irrelevant to us. We do not pretend to create a 'model' for anyone. Nor do we preach the 'superiority' of our path to socialism over the path chosen by other socialist countries. We only say - and the facts prove it - that only by following Poland's own path to socialism can we strengthen Polish socialism and Poland's unity with the socialist camp. This path is not readily available and easy. We are in the midst of difficulties in finding a type of Polish socialism suitable for our traditions, characteristics, character, and conditions. We are looking for new and effective forms of the people's parliamentary system, striving to make the parliament undertake the role of the highest body supervising the government (which is the guarantee of socialist democracy), and also undertake the role of constantly helping the government solve various important problems."

The article pointed out: "Since October 1956, Poland's foreign friends have observed everything that has happened in our country with great hope, but also with some concern. What makes them worry? That is the phenomenon of confusion, anarchy, and nationalism that has emerged here, which is particularly manifested in the events in Bydgoszcz and Szczecin. Many friends abroad are concerned about the future of socialist democratization in Poland, and they are worried about whether our country will abandon the socialist road and become a center of unrest and conflict. Let us say openly that we do not in the slightest underestimate any of the above-mentioned phenomena, some of which could have been prevented in time, but some are also inevitable after such a major shock. We are resolutely fighting all such phenomena. The new leadership of the party and the government openly stated that it needs the support of the public. On the other hand, the reason why our leadership dared to hold elections so soon after the great shock of October is because the party and the government trust the patriotic and progressive forces. Despite past mistakes, the socialist system has taken root in Polish soil in the past decade. We firmly believe in the socialist creativity of our country's workers, intellectuals, and youth, and firmly believe in the ability and political wisdom of farmers and the vast majority of the people to handle problems. The nationalistic sentiments that have recently emerged in our country have nothing in common with socialist patriotism and national self-esteem."

    波“人民论坛报”号召共产党人积极参加选举
    同民族统一阵线成员一道，揭露和消除敌人的活动，争取议会选举的胜利，从而巩固社会主义民主，加强欧洲和平和社会主义阵营。
    新华社华沙8日电“人民论坛报”7日发表了题为“共产党人走上选举斗争的前线”的社论。
    社论说：离大选只有两个星期了，选举运动应该发展到最高潮。在全波各地已经举行了许多会议和候选人同选民的会见，但是党的组织和许多党的积极分子还没有积极参加选举运动，党还没有能够同全体党员一起投入选举运动。
    社论指出，我们不是光说不作的人，我们只是想把真理告诉群众。我们不愿意去购买选票。我们要加强国家主权，要扩大我们社会和国家生活中的民主，要根据波兰民族的特点来建设社会主义，从而尽快地提高人民生活水平。但是这需要劳动和时间。波兰统一工人党的党员可以向社会和选民说清：十月之后两个多月来的事实，已经证明我们的言行是一致的。那么，为什么党组织和许多党员还没有积极投入战斗呢？很清楚，其主要责任是党的领导和中央协商机关展开宣传工作太迟了，到今天还没有发出足够的宣传资料。我们的“人民论坛报”也不是没有责任的。我们所以没有好好开展选举的宣传，还有其它的原因，那就是有些共产党人消沉，有些人失掉了方向，而有些人则因十月的成就而高枕无忧。许多党组织在十月前后表现了巨大积极性，以后却不止一次地削弱了，并且发生了个人纠纷，这都是不利于党在选举期间的政治活动的。不进行政治斗争，选举是不会自己胜利的。
    选举法所规定的政治生活的民主化、自由选举等，正被社会主义的敌人利用来达到他们自己的目的。在选举运动初期，我们就有事实证明，当时社会主义的凶恶敌人就企图潜入民族统一阵线的议员候选人名单。敌人没有睡觉，这不是空话，而是事实。因此虽然全国人民的一切健康力量都在我们这边，我们仍然不能高枕无忧。现在敌人开始了另一种活动。敌人诬蔑我们的候选人，用最肮脏的伎俩攻击我们的候选人，企图使党员候选人落选。在某些地方，则有反对中央候选人的叫嚣。有些持有党证的人也发出这种叫嚣。应该说清楚，党不能容忍这种反领导、反党、反八中全会、反波兰十月的敌对行为，而不管他们用什么伪装着，也不管他们反党、反中央候选人的动机是什么。因为他们是厌恶社会主义的。我们党组织和一切党员都应该敏锐地注意这一点。要向选民说清楚，波兰不可能走向资本主义或者回到过去的年代。
    社论最后号召全党充分动员，同民族统一阵线成员一道充分展开选举活动，揭露和消除敌人的活动，充分团结起来争取选举的胜利。
    新华社华沙9日电　“人民论坛报”昨天登载了波列斯瓦夫·沃伊切茨基的一篇文章，题目是：“1月20日在波兰国内外”。文章说，在全世界各地，我们的朋友以及社会主义和波兰的敌人都在密切注视着将在1月20日举行的议会选举的结果。在这一天，波兰公众将经受另一次对他们的团结和政治成熟性的考验。议会选举能够而且应该巩固社会主义民主和稳定国内局势，从而加强欧洲和平和社会主义阵营，这就需要人们用自己的投票行动来回答那些破坏选举和反对统一工人党候选人的人的图谋。波兰的国际威信也取决于1月20日。很清楚，民族统一阵线的胜利，无论在国内和国际合作方面，都将增加顺利解决我国经济困难的真正的可能性。
    文章接着说，任何所谓波兰在社会主义阵营内有其特殊“使命”的思想都是同我们不相干的。我们一点也不妄想为任何人建立一种“样式”。我们也不宣扬我们走向社会主义的道路对于其他社会主义国家所选择的道路的“优越性”。我们只是说——事实也证明如此——只有沿着波兰自己的道路走向社会主义，才能加强波兰的社会主义和波兰同社会主义阵营的团结。这种道路并不是现成的和容易的。我们正在困难中寻找适合于自己的传统、特点、性格和条件的波兰的社会主义类型。我们正在寻找人民议会制度的新的有效的形式，努力使议会担负起监督政府的最高机关的作用（这是社会主义民主的保证），并且也担负起经常帮助政府解决各项重要问题的作用。
    文章指出：从1956年10月以来，波兰的国外朋友抱着很大的希望，但是也带着些担心来观察我国所发生的一切。使他们担心的是什么呢？这就是我们这里产生的一些混乱、无政府状态和民族主义的现象，这特别表现在比得哥煦和什切青的事件中。国外许多朋友关心波兰社会主义民主化的前途，他们担心我国会不会放弃社会主义道路而变成不安和冲突的中心。让我们公开说，我们丝毫也不轻视任何上述那些现象，其中有些原是可以及时防止的，但有些也是这样一个大震动之后难免的现象。我们正在同一切这类现象进行坚决的斗争。党和政府新的领导公开指出，它需要公众的支持。另一方面，我们的领导所以敢于在十月这个大震动之后不久就举行选举，是因为党和政府信任爱国和进步的力量。尽管过去有过错误，社会主义制度在过去十年里已经在波兰土地上生了根。我们深信我国工人、知识分子和青年的社会主义创造性力量，深信农民和绝大多数人民的处理问题的能力和政治智慧。我国最近出现的民族主义情绪是同社会主义爱国主义和民族自尊心没有共同之点的。
