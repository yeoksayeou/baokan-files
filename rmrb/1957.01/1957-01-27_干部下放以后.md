    After Cadres are Transferred Downward
    Reports in various newspapers have already covered a lot about streamlining institutions and transferring cadres downward. However, there is little discussion about the work situation of these cadres after they are transferred downward, how they delve into the masses, integrate with the masses, and how they cooperate closely with local cadres to carry out work. I hope newspapers will report more on these situations.

    干部下放以后
    精简机构，下放干部，这方面的情况各报报道得已经不少。但是这些干部下放以后，工作情况怎么样，他们怎样深入群众，和群众打成一片，怎样和当地的干部密切合作，开展工作，却谈得很少。希望报纸多报道这些情况。
