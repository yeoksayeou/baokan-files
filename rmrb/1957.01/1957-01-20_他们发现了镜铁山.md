    They Discovered Jingtieshan
    By Our Reporter Liu Bang
    On the banks of the surging Shule River, on the boundless Gobi Desert, and on the year-round snowy peaks of the Tole Mountains, the Qilian Mountains Comprehensive Survey Team left its footprints everywhere. Over the past three years, they have found hundreds of mineralized occurrences and mineral deposits in this area, providing the country with exploration bases for important minerals such as copper, iron, lead, zinc, and nickel. They have also mapped a total of 100,000 square kilometers of geological maps of various scales in the Qilian Mountains area. From a team of only eight or nine geological personnel, it has developed into a geological survey team of hundreds of people.
    In 1954, the geological personnel, carrying maps, compasses, and hammers, set out for the snowy mountains and Gobi Desert with beautiful hopes.
    This year was the first year of hard exploration. They fought against the treacherous cliffs, as well as wild animals, hunger, thirst, cold, and their own lack of experience and knowledge. Their hammers knocked on every test pit, and their tongues licked countless rocks. Finally, not long after setting out, they found a medium-sized deposit. Victory strengthened their confidence; however, the majestic, vast, and profound Qilian Mountains still had many areas that were geologically blank, and there were still millions of rocks waiting for geologists' wisdom to explore.
    The summer of 1955 was coming to an end. But the mineral deposits they were looking for were still nowhere to be found! The ministry and bureau were also particularly concerned. What to do?
    An important issue was raised by Team Leader Fan Yi. He emphatically pointed out: Hard work and endurance are the characteristics of our geological survey personnel, but relying solely on this cannot obtain the mineral deposits we need; we must closely combine scientific survey methods with the work methods of mobilizing and relying on the masses.
    After this, when people's representatives' meetings were held in various counties along the mountains, the team sent people to publicize the significance of the masses reporting mineral deposits. When the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County convened meetings of district and township cadres, the team's staff also went to explain the common knowledge of how to identify ores. After this, hunters from the Qilian Mountains were repeatedly invited into tents; shepherd boys also frequently became guests of the survey team. Thus, touching deeds appeared: An Guanbushijia, the county head of the Sunan Yugur Autonomous County, personally selected several good horses and, together with Team Leader Fan Yi and Engineer Yan Jinan, crossed the primeval forest area, walked into knee-deep muddy grasslands, and climbed the 4,500-meter-high snow ridge to survey a mineral information location. Soon, a giant lead-zinc mine was discovered with the help of the masses; copper, nickel, fluorite, barite and other mineral deposits were also surveyed one after another. The difficult situation was gradually opened up by the power of the masses. However, the mineral deposits that the country most urgently needed had not yet been found!
    Originally, when the central government convened the National Resources Conference in 1951, it had hoped to find an iron mine in the Northwest. In the past four or five years, how many geological personnel had put in tremendous efforts to meet the needs of the country. However, until the summer of 1955, the iron mine still had not been found.
    One morning in the autumn of 1955, Engineer Yan Jinan, together with technician Chen Hongyu and Yan Shaohua, went to the Qilian Mountains. That day, they walked more than sixty kilometers. Night fog enveloped the mountains, and the surroundings were pitch black. The hands of the luminous watch told people that it was already 11 o'clock at night, and they still had not found a place to stay. Even though they were experienced geological personnel, they could not help but worry at this time.
    "Woof woof woof!" Someone was imitating a dog's bark, and then everyone started imitating. After a while, the real barking of dogs could be faintly heard from three or four miles away. They followed the sound.
    That night, they stayed in a Tibetan's tent. The elderly Tibetan woman warmly cooked and boiled water for them. Late at night, just as they were about to lie down to rest, a Tibetan man in his forties entered the tent.
    "I want to report a mineral deposit!" he said.
    He was Chai Ang A la Shiden. His long hunting life made him familiar with every mountain, deep ditch, and river valley within hundreds of miles around. Thirteen years ago, during the rule of the reactionary government, he had led the way for the Northwest Geological Survey Team at that time. In one place, they found a piece of black, hard, and heavy stone. However, the people from the survey team left without saying anything. Time had passed for thirteen years, and Chai Ang A la Shiden had almost forgotten about this matter. But tonight, when he heard that Chairman Mao had sent people to explore for treasures, he hurriedly ran to the tent where Engineer Yan Jinan was staying and told them everything that had happened thirteen years ago.
    "Is it this kind of stone?" Yan Jinan took out a specimen he was carrying and gave it to Chai Ang A la Shiden. He took it and estimated its weight in his palm, and replied casually, "That's it!"
    The next day, following the route pointed out by Chai Ang A la Shiden, Engineer Yan led the survey team, climbed one snowy mountain after another, and slid across one ice river after another. They walked for two whole days. In the evening, they were suddenly attracted by a purplish-black, glittering thing underground. They knocked it down with a hammer and took a look, hey! It turned out to be shiny iron ore. They climbed up along the mountain gully, and the ore became more and more abundant, and the pieces became larger and larger. Looking up at the cliffs, the dark red iron ore outcrops appeared dazzling in the oblique rays of the setting sun. The first ore body of a giant iron mine in the Qilian Mountains was discovered in this way!
    That night, when they returned to the campsite, the cook hurriedly reported an unfortunate piece of news: the iron pot they had brought was broken by a yak.
    "We found an iron mine, what does it matter if an iron pot is broken!" the young technician Yan Shaohua shouted and jumped at the cook.
    A few days later, they and the personnel sent by the ministry and bureau to support them continued to find several large ore bodies, and with the unique sense of pride of geological survey personnel, they gave these nameless treasure mountains a name: Jingtieshan (Mirror Iron Mountain). A few days later, the good news of the discovery of Jingtieshan spread all over the country.
    1955 was thus recorded as a "year of harvest" in the history of this survey team. But if compared with 1956, that was nothing. In this year, the team mapped geological maps of different scales totaling 47,000 square kilometers, almost equal to the sum of the past two years; in this year, the team discovered more than sixty mineralized occurrences and mineral deposits, including fifteen kinds of minerals such as copper, iron, lead, zinc, and tungsten. On some very promising non-ferrous metal mines, geological personnel and workers, braving the wind and snow of the severe winter, are further engaged in exploration; a pyrite-type vein extending hundreds of kilometers is gradually being discovered and confirmed. What is particularly worth mentioning is that when I visited this team, in addition to the team leader and engineers, it was unexpectedly difficult to find someone familiar with the history of this team. It turned out that those "old soldiers" from 1954 and 1955 had been transferred to support the newly established exploration teams as the mining areas they surveyed increased. The vast majority of those currently performing combat missions in the team are "new recruits." However, this has not weakened the team's combat effectiveness, because the excellent tradition has been retained and is continuing to be carried forward, that is: the combination of scientific survey methods and the mass line work method.

    他们发现了镜铁山
    本报记者　柳梆
    在波浪滔滔的疏勒河畔，在平沙万里的戈壁滩上，在终年积雪的托赖高峰，到处留下了祁连山综合普查队的足迹。三年来，他们在这个地区内，找到了百数十个矿化现象的矿点，为国家提供了铜、铁、铅、锌、镍等重要矿产的勘探基地。他们还在祁连山地区测绘了各种比例尺总数达十万平方公里的地质图。从只有八、九名地质人员的队伍，发展成为一支数以百计的地质普查队伍。
    1954年，地质人员背着图囊、罗盘和铁锤，怀着美好的希望，开始向雪山戈壁进军。
    这一年，是辛勤摸索的第一年。他们同险恶的削壁悬崖作过斗争，也同豺狼猛兽，同饥渴寒冷，同自己的经验学识不足作过斗争。他们的铁锤敲过了每一个探坑，舌头舔过数不尽的岩石。终于，出发不久就找到了一个中等类型的矿床。胜利增强了他们的信心；然而巍峨、博大、湛深的祁连山，还有许许多多地方是地质上的空白地带，还有千千万万块石头在等待着地质师的智慧去探索。
    1955年的夏天快要过去了。可是要找的矿藏还没有着落呢！部里局里也格外关心。怎么办呢？
    一个重要的问题由樊毅队长提出来了。他强调地指出：吃苦耐劳是我们地质普查人员的特点，但是光凭这一点并不能得到我们所需要的矿藏；必须把科学的普查方法和发动群众、依靠群众的工作方法紧紧地结合起来。
    在这以后，沿山各县召开人民代表会议时，队里就派人去宣传群众报矿的意义。天祝藏族自治县召集区乡干部会议，队里的工作人员也去讲解怎样识别矿石的常识。在这以后，祁连山的猎户屡次被邀请到帐篷里来；牧羊的娃娃也经常成为普查队的座上嘉宾。于是，感人的事迹出现了：肃南裕固族自治县的安官布什加县长，亲自选择了几匹好马，偕同樊毅队长和严济南工程师，穿过原始森林地带，走进泥泞没膝的草地，爬上四千五百公尺高的雪岭，去踏勘一个矿产情报地点。不久，一个巨型的铅锌矿在群众的协助下被发现了；铜、镍、萤石、重晶石等矿藏也先后被勘查出来。困难的局面逐渐被群众的力量打开了。但是，国家最迫切需要的矿藏还没有找到哩！
    原来，1951年中央召开全国资源会议的时候，曾希望能在西北找一个铁矿。四、五年以来，先后有多少个地质人员，为了满足国家的需要，曾付出了巨大的劳动。然而直到1955年夏天，铁矿还是没有找到。
    1955年秋天的一个早晨，严济南工程师偕同技术员陈鸿玉和鄢少华到祁连山里去。这天，他们足足走了六十多公里的路程。夜雾笼罩着群山，周围是一片漆黑。夜光表的指针告诉人们已经是深夜十一点了，他们还没有找到地方住宿。尽管是有经验的地质人员，这时也不免要发愁。
    “汪汪汪！”不知是哪个在学狗叫，接着大家都学开了。半晌，三、四里外居然隐隐地传来了真正的狗叫声。他们就循着这声音摸去。
    这天夜里，他们一行都宿在藏民的帐篷里。藏族的老大娘亲热地为他们做饭烧水。夜深了，他们刚要躺下来休息，一个四十上下的藏族壮汉钻进了帐篷。
    “我要来报一个矿！”他说。
    他就是柴昂阿来什登。长期的狩猎生活，使他熟悉周围几百里的每个山头、深沟和河谷。十三年前反动政府统治时期，他曾替当时的西北地质考察团带过路。在一个地方，他们找到了一块又黑又硬又重的石头。然而考察团的人什么没说就走了。时间过去了十三年，柴昂阿来什登把这事都快忘掉了。但是今夜当他听说毛主席派来探宝的人，匆匆忙忙地跑到严济南工程师住的帐篷里，一五一十把十三年前的那桩事告诉了他们。
    “是不是这种石头？”严济南把随身携带的一块标本拿给柴昂阿来什登。他接过来放在掌上估了一下重量，随口答道：“就是它！”
    次日，按照柴昂阿来什登指出的路线，严工程师带着那个普查小组，爬过了一座雪山又一座雪山，滑过了一道冰河又一道冰河。整整走了两天。傍晚，他们突然被地下一处紫黑色的，光闪闪的东西吸引住，用锤子敲下来一瞧，嘿！原来正是亮晶晶的铁矿石。他们沿着山沟往上爬，矿石越来越多，块也越来越大。抬头仰望悬崖，暗红色的铁矿露头在夕阳斜照中，显得绚烂夺目。祁连山里巨型铁矿的第一个矿体就这样被发现了！
    当天夜里他们回到宿营地的时候，炊事员急着报告一个不幸的消息：带来的铁锅被牦牛摔碎了。
    “找到了个铁矿，打破了个铁锅算什么！”年青的技术员鄢少华连嚷带跳地冲着炊事员说。
    几天以后，他们和部、局派来支援的人员又继续找到几个大矿体，并且以地质普查人员特有的自豪感给这些无名的宝山起个名字叫镜铁山。几天以后，发现镜铁山的喜讯在全国各地传开了。
    1955年就这样以“丰收年”被记入这个普查队的历史。但是如果和1956年比较起来，那又算不了什么。这一年，这个队测绘了不同比例尺的地质图达四万七千平方公里，几乎相等于过去两年的总和；这一年，这个队发现的矿化现象的矿点达六十多处，包括铜、铁、铅、锌、?等十五种矿产。在一些很有希望的有色金属矿山上，地质人员和工人们冒着严冬的风雪，在进一步地从事查勘；一条迤逦几百公里的黄铁矿类型的矿脉走向正在逐渐被发现和证实着。特别值得一提的是：当我访问这个队的时候，除了队长和工程师以外，要找一个熟悉这个队的历史的人，竟然遇到意想不到的困难。原来1954年和1955年的那些“老战士”，已经随着他们普查出来的矿区的日益增多，纷纷被调去支援新成立的勘探队了。现在在队上执行战斗任务的绝大部分是“新兵”。然而，这并没有削弱这个队的战斗力，因为优良的传统一直被保留下来，并且还在继续发扬着，那就是：科学的普查方法和群众路线的工作方法相结合。
