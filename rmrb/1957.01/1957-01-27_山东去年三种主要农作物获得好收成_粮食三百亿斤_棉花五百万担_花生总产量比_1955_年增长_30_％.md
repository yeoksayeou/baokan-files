Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 26th: At a recent conference of agricultural section (bureau) chiefs from various special districts (cities) convened by the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture, many representatives cited vivid facts to illustrate the great achievements made in production last year after the province realized agricultural cooperativization.

Yang Jie, Director of the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture, said that according to preliminary statistics, the province's total grain output (including soybeans) reached 30 billion jin last year, an increase of 11% compared to 1955; total cotton output reached approximately 5 million dan, an increase of 19% compared to 1955; and total peanut output reached 2.7 billion jin, an increase of 30% compared to 1955. The output of these three major crops also exceeded the original planned targets for 1957. The increase in grain production was achieved despite a reduction of more than 3 million mu of grain fields due to the increased planting of cash crops. He said: Without the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization and the subsequent upsurge of agricultural production, it would have been impossible to achieve such a harvest as last year. Thanks to the establishment of more than 70,000 agricultural cooperatives throughout the province, with 95% of farmers joining the cooperatives, and more than 360,000 members learning various agricultural techniques, the scale of implementing various yield-increasing measures last year far exceeded any previous year. Compared to 1955, the irrigated area in the province expanded threefold, the planting area of high-yield crops expanded by nearly one-quarter, the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu of farmland increased by 23%, the planting area of various improved crop varieties expanded by one-third, the intercropping area expanded threefold, and the inter-planting area expanded fourfold. The areas of farmland implementing other measures such as close planting, soil improvement, and pest and disease control also saw significant increases compared to the past.

Last year, Shandong Province experienced relatively severe natural disasters. Many representatives recounted the superiority displayed by agricultural cooperatives in overcoming natural disasters. Last year, agricultural cooperatives in low-lying, flood-prone areas constructed 7.04 million mu of ditches and raised fields, agricultural cooperatives in plain areas constructed 8.94 million mu of raised fields, and agricultural cooperatives in mountainous and hilly areas built a large number of ponds, dams, reservoirs, and other soil and water conservation projects. As a result, although the rainfall during the flood season in the province slightly exceeded that of 1953, the flood-affected area decreased by 68% compared to 1953. Wang Chao, the agricultural section chief of the Changwei Special District, said that the Changwei Special District suffered continuous severe disasters such as wind, hail, water, and insects last year. Through the timely rescue efforts of agricultural cooperatives in various places, the total grain output of the entire special district still increased by 14.85% compared to 1955.

The speeches of the representatives from the Liaocheng and Heze special districts were particularly interesting. In the past, these two special districts had extensive cultivation practices, and the yield per unit area of various crops was very low. However, in the first year after realizing agricultural cooperativization, the situation changed greatly. As a result of implementing various agricultural yield-increasing measures in the Liaocheng Special District, the average grain yield per mu reached 260.36 jin last year, an increase of 21.7% compared to 1955. The area of the Heze Special District affected by floods last year increased by two and a half times compared to 1955, and the area of grain fields decreased by 500,000 mu. However, the total grain output still increased by 5.86% compared to 1955. In 1955, the average cotton yield per mu in this special district was only 29 jin of ginned cotton, but last year it increased to 41.5 jin. In the past, farmers in these two special districts rarely had the habit of raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer, and therefore the amount of fertilizer applied to farmland was very low. With the development of the cooperativization movement, by the end of last year, the number of pigs raised in the Liaocheng and Heze special districts was two times and three times higher, respectively, than at the end of 1955.

The speeches of many representatives also showed that after the province realized agricultural cooperativization, the number of high-yield agricultural cooperatives that achieved a yield of 1,000 jin of grain, 100 jin of ginned cotton, or 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu of farmland greatly increased compared to 1955. The agricultural section chief of the Jining Special District cited more than a dozen agricultural cooperatives with large areas of high yields, including the Dengta Agricultural Cooperative in Sishui County, which averaged 1,013 jin of wheat per mu, and the Sunge Agricultural Cooperative in Jinxiang County, which averaged 1,040 jin of rice per mu. In 1955, only a few agricultural cooperatives in the province achieved a high yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu on average. However, last year, in the Heze Special District, which has always been known as a "low-yield cotton area," there were 110 agricultural cooperatives, with more than 6,000 mu of cotton fields averaging 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu.

### 山东去年三种主要农作物获得好收成  粮食三百亿斤　棉花五百万担  花生总产量比1955年增长30％

    山东去年三种主要农作物获得好收成
    粮食三百亿斤　棉花五百万担
    花生总产量比1955年增长30％
    新华社济南26日电　在山东省农业厅最近召开的各专署（市）农业科（局）长会议上，许多代表列举生动的事实说明，去年全省实现农业合作化以后在生产上取得的巨大成就。
    山东省农业厅厅长杨节说，根据初步统计，去年全省粮食总产量（包括大豆）达到三百亿斤，比1955年增长11％；棉花总产量达到五百万担左右，比1955年增长19％；花生总产量达到二十七亿斤，比1955年增长30％。这三种主要作物的产量，还都超过了原订的1957年计划指标。其中粮食产量的增长，还是在因增种经济作物而减少了三百多万亩粮田的情况下获得的。他说：如果没有农业合作化高潮和随之而来的农业生产高潮，要得到像去年这样的收成是不可能的。由于全省有了七万多个农业社，95％的农户入了社，以及有三十六万多名社员学习了各种农业技术，去年推行各项增产措施的规模远远超过已往任何一年。同1955年比较，去年全省灌溉面积扩大了三倍，高产作物的种植面积扩大了近四分之一，每亩农田的平均施肥量增加了23％，各种作物良种的种植面积扩大了三分之一，间作面积扩大了三倍，套作面积扩大了四倍。其他如密植、改良土壤、防治病虫害的农田面积，也都比过去大有增加。
    去年山东省的自然灾害比较严重，许多代表讲述了农业社在战胜自然灾害方面所显示的优越性。去年这个省低洼易涝地区的农业社修筑沟洫畦田七百零四万亩，平原地区的农业社修筑畦田八百九十四万亩，山区和丘陵地区的农业社兴修了大量塘坝、水库和其它水土保持工程，因此全省汛期降雨量虽然略超过1953年，但是水灾面积却比1953年减少68％。昌潍专署的农业科长王超说，去年昌潍专区连续遭受风雹、水、虫等严重灾害，经过各地农业社及时抢救，全专区粮食总产量还是比1955年增加了14.85％。
    聊城、菏泽两个专署的代表的发言，特别使人感到兴趣。这两个专区过去耕作粗放，各种农作物的单位面积产量都很低，可是在实现农业合作化以后的第一年，情况就大大改变了。聊城专区推行各项农业增产措施的结果，去年粮食每亩平均产量达到两百六十点三六斤，比1955年增长了21.7％。菏泽专区去年遭受水灾的面积比1955年增加了两倍半，而且减少了五十万亩粮田，可是粮食总产量还是比1955年增长了5.86％。1955年这个专区的棉田平均每亩只收皮棉二十九斤，而去年增加到了四十一点五斤。过去这两个专区的农民很少有养猪积肥的习惯，因而农田施肥量很少；随着合作化运动的发展，到去年年底，聊城、菏泽两专区的养猪头数比1955年年底分别多了两倍和三倍。
    在许多代表的发言中还表明，全省实现农业合作化以后，获得每亩农田产一千斤粮食或一百斤皮棉或一万斤甘薯的高额丰产农业社比1955年大大增多了。济宁专署农业科长举出十多个大面积高额丰产的农业社，其中有每亩小麦平均产一千零一十三斤的泗水县灯塔农业社，每亩水稻平均产一千零四十斤的金乡县孙阁农业社等。1955年全省还只有少数农业社获得平均每亩产一百斤皮棉的高额产量，可是在去年，光是一向被称为“棉花低产地区”的菏泽专区，就出现了一百一十个农业社，六千多亩棉田平均每亩产一百斤皮棉。
