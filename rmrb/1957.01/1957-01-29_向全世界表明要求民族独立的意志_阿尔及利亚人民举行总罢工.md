    Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, 28th: The Algerian people today responded to the call of the Algerian National Liberation Front and held a general strike. This morning, Algiers was almost devoid of pedestrians. All shops were tightly shuttered. Although French soldiers later forced the shops open, the shop assistants refused to do business and some simply left the premises. Since last night, many municipal transport workers have left their posts. This morning, the buses that were running were driven by Europeans under the surveillance of French soldiers, but there were only a few passengers inside.
    The French colonial authorities acted as if facing a formidable enemy. It is estimated that 15,000 French soldiers and police officers patrolled the streets incessantly. Armored vehicles guarded intersections. Military helicopters circled continuously over the city.
    In order to block news during the United Nations' discussion of the Algerian question, the French colonial authorities cut off telegram and telephone communications between Algeria and the rest of the world starting today.
    In Constantine and some other cities, the strike also took place as scheduled. Among the 350,000 Algerian workers in France, some also responded to the call for a strike today. In Paris alone, half of the Algerian workers participated in the strike.
    The Algerian National Liberation Front called for an eight-day general strike to show the world the Algerian people's strong will for national independence during the United Nations' discussion of the Algerian question.

    向全世界表明要求民族独立的意志
    阿尔及利亚人民举行总罢工
    新华社28日讯　阿尔及尔消息：阿尔及利亚人民今天响应阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的号召，举行总罢工。阿尔及尔市今天早晨几乎见不到一个行人。所有店铺都紧闭着大门。以后尽管法国兵把店门打开，店员还是拒绝做生意，有的干脆离开了铺子。从昨天晚上起，许多市内交通员工就离开了工作。今天早晨行驶的公共汽车是欧洲人在法国兵监视下驾驶的，但是里面只有寥寥几个乘客。
    法国殖民当局如临大敌一般。据估计有一万五千个法国士兵和警察川流不息地在街上巡逻。装甲车守着十字路口。在城市上空，不停地盘旋着军用直升飞机。
    法国殖民当局为了在联合国讨论阿尔及利亚问题期间封锁新闻，从今天起断绝了阿尔及利亚同世界各地的电报和电话往来。
    在君士坦丁市和别的一些城市，罢工也按期举行。在法国的三十五万阿尔及利亚工人中，今天也有一部分人响应了罢工的号召。光在巴黎就有一半阿尔及利亚工人参加了罢工。
    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线号召举行八天总罢工，是为了在联合国讨论阿尔及利亚问题期间向全世界表明阿尔及利亚人民要求民族独立的坚强意志。
