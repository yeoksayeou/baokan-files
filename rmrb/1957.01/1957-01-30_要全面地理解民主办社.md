    To Comprehensively Understand Democratic Cooperative Management
    The Gansu Daily recently initiated a discussion on democratic cooperative management. In organizing this discussion, the newspaper paid attention to both promoting democracy and educating cooperative members to respect leadership and abide by labor discipline. In an article written by Han Junqing, director of the Xianfeng Vegetable Production Cooperative in Lanzhou, published on January 19, this issue was addressed.
    Han Junqing wrote: During the rectification of the cooperative, the Xianfeng Cooperative examined the democratic work style of its staff. Before the examination, the leadership clearly stated that the purpose of examining the democratic work style of the staff was to improve work, not to "attack" people. However, after examining the work style, some staff members (a deputy director and some team and group leaders) showed discouragement and asked to resign. Later, the cooperative summarized the work of the past year, both reviewing the shortcomings in the work and affirming the achievements in the work. The negative emotions of those who requested "resignation" were finally changed, but the ideological problem was not completely resolved.
    Why did this happen? The director said that this is largely related to the fact that cooperative members do not have a comprehensive understanding of the democratic cooperative management policy.
    Han Junqing said: During the rectification, the most opinions were given by cooperative members to team and group leaders, and all the opinions given were about shortcomings. This has a great impact on the emotions of the cooperative's staff. Some staff members said: Before the emphasis on promoting democracy, it seemed that the cooperative's achievements were great; once democracy is promoted, the cooperative is like a "mess," and they have no intention of being cadres! The author said that this is greatly related to the one-sidedness of our publicity. In the rectification of the cooperative, we only paid attention to democracy and did not pay attention to centralization, and did not mobilize cooperative members to examine whether they abide by labor discipline on the basis of examining the democratic work style of the leadership. Therefore, after promoting democracy, cooperative members no longer listen to instructions.
    The cooperative director finally said that his understanding of the full content of democratic cooperative management is not clear enough. "What kind of policy and ideological boundaries should be clarified in the future to fully implement democratic cooperative management?" He hopes that comrades from various places will further study this issue.

### 要全面地理解民主办社

    要全面地理解民主办社
    甘肃日报最近发起了关于民主办社的讨论。在组织这个讨论的过程中，该报注意了既发扬民主、又教育社员尊重领导和遵守劳动纪律的问题。1月19日报纸发表的兰州市先锋蔬菜生产合作社主任韩俊卿写的文章中，就谈到了这个问题。
    韩俊卿写道：先锋合作社在整社过程中，检查了工作人员的民主作风。在检查以前，领导方面曾经明确说明，检查工作人员的民主作风，为的是改进工作，不是“整”人。但是，在检查作风以后，有些工作人员（一个副主任和一些队长、组长）表现灰心丧气，要求辞职。后来，合作社总结了一年来的工作，既检讨了工作中的缺点，也肯定了工作中的成绩。那些要求“辞职”的人的消极情绪总算改变了，但是，思想上的问题并没有完全解决。
    为什么会出现这种情况呢？这位主任说，这是同社员没有全面地认识民主办社方针有很大关系。
    韩俊卿说：在整社中，社员给队长、组长提的意见最多，并且提的全部是缺点。这对于合作社的工作人员的情绪有很大影响。有的工作人员说：没有强调发扬民主的时候，看起来合作社的成绩很大；这一发扬民主，合作社里就像“一团糟”了，还有什么心思当干部！作者说，这同我们宣传上的片面性有很大关系。我们在整社中，只注意民主，没有注意集中，没有发动社员在检查领导方面的民主作风的基础上来检查自己是不是遵守劳动纪律。因此，在发扬民主以后，社员们便不听指挥了。
    这位合作社主任最后说，在他的思想上，对于民主办社的全部内容还不够明确，“今后应该明确一些什么样的政策思想界限，全面贯彻执行民主办社呢？”他希望各地同志们进一步研究这个问题。
