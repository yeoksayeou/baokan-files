    The Nation's Only Shui Inhabited Area
    Establishment of Sandu Shui Autonomous County

    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, January 2nd: Sandu Shui Autonomous County, the only Shui inhabited area in the country, located in southeastern Guizhou Province, was formally established today.

    The first session of the First People's Congress of Sandu Shui Autonomous County, which closed today, elected Meng Kaijiang (Shui) as County Head, Pan Yizhi (Shui), Wei Guoqi (Shui), Wang Laosi (Miao), Meng Shihua (Shui, female), Wang Yuan (Buyi), and Wei Zuochen (Shui) as Deputy County Heads, and elected twenty members of the County People's Committee; Yang Shengshu (Shui) was elected as President of the County People's Court.

    The meeting listened to and approved the report on the main work over the past seven years and future work opinions made by Zhai Xuming, Deputy Secretary of the CCP Sandu County Committee, on behalf of the County Committee. He pointed out that Sandu has basically achieved advanced agricultural cooperativization, with continuous increases in grain production and gradual increases in farmers' income. The achievements are inseparable from the county's cultivation and promotion of 982 cadres from various ethnic groups, mainly Shui. He asked farmers of all ethnic groups in the county to implement the policy of "running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and running cooperatives democratically," and strive to increase grain production by 10% this year compared to last year.

    One hundred and fifty-six representatives from seven ethnic groups, including Shui, Miao, Buyi, Han, Yao, Dong, and Zhuang, were very concerned about their autonomy. Many representatives traveled over mountains to bring the opinions of the voters to the meeting.

    The meeting lasted six days. During the meeting, Sandu City was crowded with people, and more than 20,000 people came spontaneously from the countryside to celebrate.

    全国唯一的水族聚居区
    三都水族自治县成立
    新华社贵阳2日电　在贵州省东南部全国唯一的水族聚居区，今天正式成立了三都水族自治县。
    今天闭幕的三都水族自治县第一届人民代表大会第一次会议，选出蒙开江（水）为县长，潘一志（水）、韦国奇（水）、王老四（苗）、蒙世花（水、女）、王元（布依）、韦佐臣（水）为副县长，选举了二十名县人民委员会委员；选出杨盛术（水）为县人民法院院长。
    会议听取和通过了中共三都县委员会副书记翟旭明代表县委作的七年来主要工作情况和今后工作意见的报告。他指出三都已基本实现高级农业合作化，粮食连年增产，农民收入逐渐增多。这些成绩的取得是同全县培养和提拔了本地以水族为主的各民族干部九百八十二人分不开的。他要求全县各族农民贯彻“勤俭办社，民主办社”方针，争取今年粮食产量比去年增加一成。
    包括水、苗、布依、汉、瑶、侗、僮等七个民族的一百五十六名代表，十分关心自己的自治权。许多代表不辞翻山越岭赶来，把选民的意见带给大会。
    会议历时六天。会议期间，三都城里人山人海，由乡间自动前来庆祝的群众有二万多人。
