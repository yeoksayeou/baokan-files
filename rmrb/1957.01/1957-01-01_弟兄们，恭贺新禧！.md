Brothers, Happy New Year!
Soviet Writer Bo Lievoi

In the morning, every time we sit at home and open the day's newspaper, still smelling of ink, after reading the news about our country's life, we immediately start looking for news from China. This has become a habit. Although Beijing and Moscow are thousands of miles apart, we always feel that Beijing is close at hand. The joy of distant China is our joy, the sorrow of China is our sorrow, and the anger of China is our anger.

This friendship between the Soviet people and the Chinese people did not arise today or yesterday. I remember when I was a member of the Communist Youth League, I paid close attention to the news in the newspapers about the large-scale class struggles in Shanghai, the heroic struggles of the Guangzhou Commune, and the miraculous Long March of the Chinese Red Army. Mayakovsky's "The Best Poem" was one of our favorite poems in our youth. At that time, in the "Female Proletarian" textile factory where I grew up, there was hardly a party where no one went on stage to recite these lines:
	I shout loudly,
		disrupting
			the tone of the poem,
	my voice louder than
		a loudspeaker: Comrades!
	Shanghai
		has been taken
			by the workers
	and soldiers of Guangzhou!

These lines may not be completely historically accurate in their description of the events, but they moved us. And we, the Communist Youth League members of Tver, applauded the Chinese comrades just as enthusiastically as the creamery workers and textile workers of Yaroslavl mentioned in the poem.

I also remember that we Communist Youth League members in that factory's Lenin Club decided to make a statement about the events in China. The events in China felt close to us at that time. We decided to stage a play about Chinese life. So we adapted Lu Xun's novel "The True Story of Ah Q" into a script and staged it. But we were not satisfied with the ending of the novel. So our Ah Q did not die; in the last scene of the play, he became a Communist Party member and went to Guangzhou to join the ranks of the Guangzhou Commune to fight. At the end of the play, he held a large red flag fluttering in the wind and led all the members of the theater group present to rush towards the barricades made of tables and benches. People in China may laugh when they read this. But this naive performance expressed our country's youth's love for the Chinese working people and their belief in their ultimate victory.

Later, at the most critical moment of World War II, when the battle on the Volga River determined the fate of our motherland, and the Western allies were still leisurely sewing the last button on their soldiers' overcoats, forcing us to fight and bleed against the full force of fascism, we also felt the support of the Chinese People's Liberation Army there, in besieged Stalingrad. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, with its heroic battles, tied the hands of our eastern enemy, the Japanese samurai. Therefore, we Soviets are always happy to congratulate the friendly Chinese people on every victory they have achieved under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party.

Last year, I was fortunate enough to travel to many places in People's China. I have been to the South and the North, to the huge construction sites on the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, and to the agricultural cooperatives where people celebrated the victory of the first autumn after collectivization. I have also been to workers' dormitories, farmers' homes, and scholars' offices. I met many respected Chinese writers and journalists. It was a wonderful trip, and everywhere I saw people actively building their future, full of socialist enthusiasm, full of socialist ideals, and as united as a rock. Wherever we went, in the city or in the countryside, we saw friends: friends of our people, friends of our culture, friends of our literature. We saw exhibitions about Soviet achievements and the crowds of people next to the exhibits. In the homes of ordinary workers, we saw books about the Soviet Union. The books were worn out and tattered, one could say they had never left the "battlefield." Everywhere, in the offices of world-renowned scholars, on the sailboats of the "water people" of Guangzhou, on trains and airplanes, on the breezy rooftops of factories under construction, in the caissons of the Yangtze River bridge piers, we heard words of respect and concern for our Soviet country, for our achievements and experiences; I think the Chinese comrades who visit our country will also get the same impression from us. The love between our two peoples is mutual love, which is the happiest kind of love.

I returned home with a large notebook. Now I am trying to write a book to tell the Soviet people what I saw in China. It is so that those who read the book in the future will be as if they have traveled to China with us: they will also see what we saw, get to know the people we met, admire the magnificent construction projects and the fertile fields of the South and the North, see the achievements of the young agricultural cooperatives, and appreciate your traditional dramas; they will also stroll with us through the Tianqiao Market in Beijing, and solemnly sit in the hall where the Chinese intellectual community commemorates Lu Xun. I want all the readers of this book to fall in love with the Chinese people, just like the three Soviet literary and art workers who traveled in China with us.

There were people of eight nationalities on the plane I took when I left Beijing. As is usually the case when setting out on a journey, we introduced ourselves to each other. Although we were different people, including two travelers from West Germany, a French Catholic priest, and a Swedish businessman, we all unanimously – each in our own way – talked about the great cause that China is now undertaking. The enormous scale and lofty purpose of this cause equally moved all of us.

I am very happy because I am able to speak to Chinese readers through the esteemed "People's Daily" and express a Soviet person's most heartfelt respect. He wants to raise a full glass at the New Year for the glorious brotherly Chinese people, for their Communist Party, for their heroic present and bright future.

Brothers, I wish you a Happy New Year!

### 弟兄们，恭贺新禧！

专栏：

    弟兄们，恭贺新禧！
    苏联作家　波列沃伊
    早晨，每当我们坐在家中翻开当天的还带有油墨气味的报纸，读过关于我国生活的新闻以后，总是立刻就开始寻找来自中国的消息。这已经习以为常了。虽然北京和莫斯科相距万里，但我们总觉得北京近在咫尺。遥远的中国的欢乐也就是我们的欢乐，中国的悲伤也就是我们的悲伤，中国的愤怒也就是我们的愤怒。
    苏联人民对中国人民的这种友情不是今天或是昨天才产生的。我记得，当我还是共青团员的时候，我就很留心报纸上刊载的上海的大规模的阶级斗争，广州公社的英勇奋斗和中国红军的神奇的长征的消息。马雅可夫斯基的“最好的诗”是我们青年时代最喜欢的一首诗。当时在我所成长起来的地方——“女无产者”纺织工厂里，差不多没有一次晚会没有人登台朗诵这几句诗的：
   我高声大喊，
        打乱了
            诗的声调，
   嗓门比大喇叭
          还高：同志们！
   上海
     被广州的工人
            和军队
    攻下了！
    这些诗句对事件的描述，可能在历史上并不完全真实，但是它们却使我们激动。而我们这些特维尔的共青团员们为中国同志鼓掌的热烈程度，丝毫也不亚于诗中提到的雅罗斯拉夫里的制奶油工人和纺织工人。
    我还记得，我们这些共青团员们在那个工厂的列宁俱乐部里，曾决定对中国发生的事件有所表示。中国的事件在当时就使我们感到亲切。我们决定上演一个关于中国生活的话剧。因此我们就把鲁迅的小说“阿Q正传”改编成剧本，搬上了舞台。可是小说的结局不能使我们满意。于是我们的阿Q并没有死去，在剧的最后一幕他变成了一个共产党员，到广州参加广州公社的队伍去战斗。在剧的结尾，他手举一面迎风招展的大红旗，引导着所有在场的戏剧小组的组员们，冲向用桌子和板凳堆成的街垒。在中国，人们读到这里也许会发笑的。但是，在这天真的演出中，却表达出我国青年对中国劳动人民的爱和相信他们最后必获胜利的信心。
    后来，在第二次世界大战的最严重的时刻，当伏尔加河上的战斗决定我们祖国的命运，而西方同盟者还在不慌不忙地为自己士兵的军大衣缝上最后的一枚纽扣，迫使我们要同法西斯的全部力量作战而流血的时候，我们在那里，在被包围的斯大林格勒，也感到了中国人民解放军的支持。中国人民解放军以英勇的战斗缚住了我们东方的敌人——武士道的日本的双手。因此，我们苏联人现在总是高兴地祝贺友好的中国人民在光荣的共产党领导下所获得的每一个胜利。
    去年，我曾幸运地在人民中国旅行过不少地方，我到过南方和北方，到过长江和黄河上的巨大建筑工地，到过人们庆祝合作化后第一个秋天的胜利的农业合作社。我还到过工人的宿舍、农民的家和学者的办公室。我结识了中国许多德高望重的作家和新闻工作者。这是一次再好不过的旅行了，到处我都看见了积极建设自己的未来、充满了社会主义热情的人民，充满了社会主义的理想的人民，团结得像磐石一般的人民。无论我们走到哪里，在城市或是乡村，我们看到的都是朋友：我国人民的朋友，我们的文化朋友，我们的文学朋友。我们曾看到关于苏联成就的展览和展览品旁边的人群。在普通劳动者的家里，我们看见了关于苏联的书。书都读烂了，磨破了，可以说它是一直都没有离开过“战斗”。到处，在举世闻名的学者的办公室里，在广州“水上人家”的帆船上，在火车里和飞机上，在那微风吹拂的、正在建筑的厂房顶上，在长江桥墩的沉箱里，我们都听到了一些对我们苏维埃国家、对我们的成就和经验的敬重和关切的话；我想，访问我国的中国同志们也会从我们这里得到同样的印象吧。我们两国人民彼此间的爱是互爱，这是一种最幸福的爱情。
    我带着一大本笔记回到家里。现在我正在试写一本书，把我在中国所看到的告诉苏联人民。为的是使将来看到这本书的人就像跟我们一起在中国旅行过一样：也会看见我们所看到的东西，认识我们所结识的人，观赏宏伟的建设工程和南方北方的良田，看到年轻的农业合作社的成就，欣赏你们的传统的戏剧；也会同我们一道逛北京的天桥市场，庄重地坐在中国知识界纪念鲁迅的大厅里。我要让这本书的所有读者都像我们三个曾在中国旅行的苏联文艺工作者一样，爱上中国人民。
    我离开北京时所乘的飞机上有八个民族的人。像通常上路的情况一样，我们互相介绍了。虽然我们是些不同的人，我们中间有两个西德的旅行者、一个法国的天主教神甫、一个瑞典商人，可是我们都一致地——各人有各人的方式——谈到了中国现在所进行的伟大事业。这种事业的巨大规模和崇高目的同样感动了我们大家。
    我非常高兴，因为我能够通过敬爱的
  “人民日报”同中国读者谈话，并表达一个苏联人的最衷心的敬意。他要在新年的时候为光荣的兄弟的中国人民，为他们的共产党，为他们英雄的现在和美好的将来而满满地干上一杯。
    兄弟们，祝你们新年快乐！
