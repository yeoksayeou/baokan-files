The Disadvantages of "Fighting Alone"—A Major Lesson in the Construction of New Industrial Zones
By Our Correspondent Long Chun

In June 1955, the Ministry of Coal Industry decided to build a new coal industrial base in the Pingdingshan area of Henan Province based on geological exploration. On September 8th of that year, the first pair of mine shafts—No. 2 mine shaft—began construction. Subsequently, on November 1st and November 7th, the No. 3 and No. 4 mine shafts also broke ground one after another.

As many people know, Pingdingshan is a small place that cannot be found on the map. In the past, there was no city, no railway, and no power station here. The roads were also not accessible. Before the construction of the three pairs of mine shafts two years ago, the Ministry of Railways did not come to build railways, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry did not come to build power stations, and the Ministry of Coal Industry did not build roads to the various mine shafts in advance, nor did they build a sufficient number of employee residences and necessary living welfare facilities. The local industrial departments also did not establish a base for producing local building materials such as bricks, tiles, lime, and stone… Under such almost completely unprepared circumstances, the shaft engineering of the three pairs of mine shafts was carried out in isolation. Some people call this construction method "dancing with a bare pole." Because this project lacked the cooperation of departments such as railways and electricity; the main body of the mine area—the shaft engineering—was fighting alone without the support of auxiliary projects and living welfare facilities.

What was the result of "dancing with a bare pole"?

Because there was no railway, all equipment and building materials had to be transported by trucks and handcarts after arriving in Xuchang. At the beginning of construction, it was the rainy season, and the roads were muddy on the long transportation line of more than 60 kilometers from Xuchang to Pingdingshan, and cars broke down everywhere. Movement was even more inconvenient on the small roads leading to the mine shafts. When it rained, even if the materials and equipment were transported to the mining area, they could not reach the shaft entrance. Last January, the highway was renovated and connected to the mining area, but the number of cars was limited, and the roads to the mine shafts were not good, so it was still necessary to use a large number of handcarts. The number of handcarts serving the construction reached more than 5,000 at its peak. Not only was transportation within the mining area dependent on handcarts, but long-distance transportation from Xuchang to Pingdingshan was also inseparable from handcarts. Moreover, for a considerable period of time, no local building material base or repair shop was established here, and even a few bricks, some lead wires, and a few parts had to be purchased and transferred from other places. Relying on such backward transportation tools to transport so much equipment and materials often failed to meet the needs of construction. Transportation costs also increased significantly as a result. The price of many building materials transported to the construction site was 50% to 100% higher than the factory price. Some bricks transported from Xinxiang cost as much as 14 cents apiece.

Because there was no electricity, problems arose in hoisting, lighting, drainage, and ventilation during mine construction. At the beginning of the three pairs of mine shafts, manual windlasses were used to hoist the excavated soil and rock; below 30 meters, automobile cranes were used; when automobile cranes were truly powerless, small steam windlasses were used. Lighting was provided by gas lamps and storage battery lamps; drainage was done with buckets; and air supply was done with diesel air compressors. Shaft sinking could only be done with hand picks and hand hammers. Lathes and welding machines in the repair shop also had to be started with diesel generators. These practices increased construction costs and delayed project progress.

Because an appropriate number of employee residences and necessary living welfare facilities were not built before construction began, life became difficult for the large number of mine construction workers who arrived in Pingdingshan one after another. Those who came first could squeeze into the homes of farmers in nearby villages, while those who came later had to live in cowsheds and mills, and some could only sleep under the eaves. Without bed boards or benches, some workers took the backboards used for mine construction to make them. The poor living conditions increased the number of illnesses, and good treatment could not be obtained. In addition, the workers were scattered in the countryside, making it inconvenient to travel at night or in bad weather, making it even more difficult to ensure attendance. Some working faces in some mines had experienced work stoppages due to workers not being able to come. It was difficult to purchase non-staple foods and daily necessities; it was difficult to take a bath and see a doctor; and watching movies and plays was out of the question. The workers complained a lot, and many could not concentrate on their work for a considerable period of time, and some even left without saying goodbye.

Under such circumstances, many problems naturally arose. The responsible comrades of the Pingdingshan construction department summarized the consequences of this isolated construction method into the following sentences: "More money was spent, people were exhausted, the quality of the project was not good, and we wanted to be fast but couldn't be!"

Due to the lack of electricity, backward production methods were adopted in the mine construction in the first few months; due to the lack of railways, a large number of cars and handcarts were used for transportation; due to the failure to establish large-scale mechanized brick and tile factories, most of the building materials relied on handicraft production or were transferred from other places; coupled with shortcomings in design and management, the construction cost of Pingdingshan coal mine was very high, and the phenomenon of overspending was very serious. By the end of last June, the shaft costs of the main shaft and one auxiliary shaft of the No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 mine shafts were more than double the planned cost, averaging 232% of the original plan. In other words, the money spent on the four shafts could have built nine identical shafts. The money wasted for the country was far more than a few thousand or tens of thousands of yuan!

The reason why the three pairs of mine shafts in Pingdingshan were constructed in isolation was mainly because the relevant departments of the central government attempted to use this method to speed up mine construction. However, the facts show that this goal has not been achieved. From the start of construction to the end of last June, the average monthly shaft sinking speed of the No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 mine shafts was only a dozen to twenty meters (the design quota was thirty meters, and some other areas exceeded this number). Yang Zhan, director of the Pingdingshan Coal Mine Preparatory Office, and Shi Bin, director of the Pingdingshan First Mine Construction Engineering Office, both believe that if these three pairs of mine shafts had not been rushed to start construction in the second half of the year before last, but had concentrated on building some auxiliary projects and made the necessary preparations, and then started the shaft engineering in January and February of last year, not only would the project progress be guaranteed, but it might have been done even better.

Now, the "dancing with a bare pole" in Pingdingshan is coming to an end. The railway is about to open to traffic, the temporary power station built by the Ministry of Coal Industry has started generating electricity, and some employee residences and living welfare buildings have also been built. The entire project has initially shaken off the passive and chaotic situation. However, the construction of this new industrial zone has caused no small loss to the country due to the lack of overall planning by the relevant departments of the central government. This lesson is painful. Moreover, the permanent power station in Pingdingshan has not yet been determined when it will be built by the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, but the Pingdingshan coal mining area is a key project for national construction. Another new pair of mine shafts started construction at the end of last year, and at least one pair of mine shafts will be put into production this year. Relying solely on the existing temporary power station cannot meet the electricity needs. This problem still needs to be quickly resolved by the relevant departments of the central government.

    “孤军作战”害处多
    ——新工业区建设的一个重大教训
    本报记者　龙春
    1955年6月间，煤炭工业部根据地质勘探情况，决定在河南省平顶山地区建设一个新煤炭工业基地。这年9月8日，第一对矿井——二号矿井就开工建设了。紧接着，在11月1日和11月7日，三号、四号两对矿井也先后破土开工。
    许多人都知道，平顶山是一个从地图上找不到的小地方。过去，这里既没有城市，也没有铁路、电站，公路也没有通到这里。前年三对矿井开工以前，铁道部没有来修铁路，电力工业部没有来修电站，煤炭工业部也没有先修好通往各对矿井的道路，没有建起适当数量的职工住宅和必要的生活福利设施，地方工业部门也没有在这里建立生产砖、瓦、石灰、料石等地方建筑材料的基地……在这种几乎是毫无准备的情况下，三对矿井的井筒工程就孤军作战地干起来了。有人把这种建设方法叫做“光杆跳舞”。因为这项工程没有铁道、电力等部门的配合；矿区的主体工程——井筒工程，也没有辅助工程、生活福利设施的配合而孤军奋斗。
      “光杆跳舞”的结果怎样呢？
    因为没有铁路，所有设备和建筑材料运到许昌以后，都要靠汽车和人力车运输。开工当时，正是雨季，从许昌到平顶山六十多公里漫长的运输线上，道路泥泞，汽车到处抛锚。通往各对矿井的小路，行动更加不便，下雨的时候，材料、设备即便运到矿区，也到不了井口。去年1月，公路才翻修完毕，并且通到矿区，但是汽车数量有限，通往矿井的道路不好，所以不得不仍旧大量使用人力车。为建设服务的人力车——架子车，最多的时候曾经达到五千多辆。不但矿区内依靠人力车运输，从许昌到平顶山的长途运输中也离不开架子车。加以在相当长的时间内，这里没有建立起地方建筑材料基地，没有修建起机修厂，几块砖，几根铅丝，几个零件，也都要到外地去采购和调运。靠这样一些落后的运输工具来运输这么多的设备和材料，便经常供不上施工的需要。运费也因此大量增加。许多建筑材料运到工地的价格，比出厂价格高出50％以至一倍以上。从新乡运来的砖，有的竟贵到一角四分钱一块。
    因为没有电力，矿井建设中的提绞、照明、排水、通风等工作都发生了问题。三对矿井开始的时候，都是由人绞辘轳来提升挖起的土和?石；到三十公尺以下，改用汽车起重吊车；当汽车吊车实在无能为力的时候，又换成小型蒸汽绞车。照明，用汽灯、蓄电池灯；排水，用吊桶；供风，用柴油压风机。开挖井筒，只好用手镐掘进，手锤打眼。修配厂的车床和电焊机等，也只好用柴油发电机来启动。这样一些做法，既增加了施工费用，也延缓了工程进度。
    因为开工以前没有修建适当数量的职工住宅和必要的生活福利设施，大批建井工人陆续到达平顶山以后，生活就发生了困难。先来的还可以挤在附近几个村庄的农民家里，后来的只好住牛棚、磨房，有的人还只能睡在屋檐下。没有床板、凳子，有的工人就把建井用的背帮板拿去改制。居住条件不好，生病的增多，也不能得到很好的治疗。加以工人都散住农村，夜间或遇到风雨行动不便，出勤率便更难保证。有的矿井的一些工作面曾经发生过因工人来不了而停止作业的现象。购买副食品、日用品困难；洗澡，看病困难；至于看电影、看戏，就更谈不到了。工人们怨声载道，不少人在相当长的时间内不能安心工作，有的人甚至不辞而别。
    在这样的情况下，自然会发生许多问题。平顶山建设部门的负责同志把这种孤军作战的建设方法的恶果归纳成下面几句话：“钱多花了，人累坏了，工程质量不好，想快又没有快了！”
    由于缺乏电力，开始几个月的矿井建设采用了落后的生产方法；由于没有铁路，运输中大量使用汽车和人力车；由于没有建立起大型机制砖瓦厂等，建筑材料大部分依靠手工业生产或从外地调运；加以设计、管理等方面存在缺点，平顶山煤矿建设工程成本很高，超支现象十分严重。到去年6月底止，二、三、四这三对矿井的主井和一个副井，井筒成本都比计划高出一倍以上，平均起来相当于原计划的232％。也就是说，四个井筒所花的钱，可以建设同样的九个井筒。为国家浪费的金钱，绝不止几千、几万元！
    平顶山的三对矿井所以采取孤军作战的方式进行建设，主要是因为中央有关部门企图用这样的办法来加快矿井建设速度。但是，事实表明，这个目的并没有达到。从开工到去年6月底，二、三、四这三对矿井每月建井速度平均只有十几公尺到二十公尺（设计定额是三十公尺，其他地区有的还超过了这个数字）。平顶山煤矿筹备处主任杨展、平顶山第一建井工程处处长施斌等都认为，如果这三对矿井在前年下半年不急于开工，而是集中力量修建些辅助工程，作好必要的准备工作，去年一、二月间再开始井筒工程，不但工程进度可以保证，而且可能搞得更好一些。
    现在，平顶山的“光杆跳舞”已接近尾声，铁路已快通车，煤炭工业部修建的临时电站已经发电，职工住宅、生活福利建筑也修建了一些，整个工程初步摆脱了被动、混乱的局面。但是，这个新工业区的建设，由于中央有关部门缺乏统盘安排，已经为国家造成不小的损失。这个教训是惨痛的。而且，目前平顶山的永久电站，电力工业部还没有确定何时建设，但是平顶山煤矿区属于国家建设的确保项目，去年年底又有一对新矿井开工，今年至少将有一对矿井投入生产，仅仅依靠现有的临时电站不能供应电力的需要。这个问题仍然需要中央有关部门迅速设法解决。
