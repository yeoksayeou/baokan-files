Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 27th – In Henan Province, one of China's main wheat-producing areas, farmers have overcome the drought that has lasted for more than four consecutive months since last autumn. Now, in most areas, the wheat seedlings have green leaves and thick roots, and are vigorously tillering.

When wheat was sown last autumn, there had been no thorough rain in Henan Province for more than a month. While engaging in intense autumn harvesting, agricultural cooperatives in various places did everything possible to ensure that most of the province's wheat fields were sown in a timely manner. Since the beginning of winter, the drought has continued to develop, and the province has launched a mass anti-drought wheat watering campaign. The various small-scale farmland water conservancy projects built in the first half of last year have for the first time demonstrated their irrigation effectiveness. In Nanyang Prefecture, which had no irrigation habits in the past, agricultural cooperatives leveled the land and purchased waterwheels for the first time, irrigating more than 80% of the wheat fields that should have been irrigated. In Xinxiang Prefecture, which has better water conservancy conditions, the area of wheat fields irrigated last winter was more than double that of the winter of 1955. After the province experienced widespread snowfall in mid-January this year, all localities launched a heat wave of snow accumulation on wheat fields. Inspired by the slogan "A load of snow, a load of grain," farmers in Luoning County transported an average of fifty loads of snow per labor force to the wheat fields.

While fighting drought to protect seedlings, agricultural cooperatives in various places also applied fertilizer to the wheat seedlings. In Xinyang Prefecture, 5.12 million mu of wheat fields were fertilized with an average of 6,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. In Xuchang Prefecture, the wheat fields that had been fertilized were applied with an average of three large carts per mu. Most of these fertilizers were highly effective manure and human excrement, and their quality far exceeded that of previous years.

    去年兴修的农田水利大显功效
    河南大部地区小麦生长良好
    新华社郑州27日电　我国小麦主要产区之一的河南省，农民战胜了去年秋季以来连续四个多月的干旱，现在大部地区麦苗叶绿根粗，分蘖旺盛。
    去年秋季播种小麦的时候，河南省就有一个多月没有下过透雨。各地农业社在紧张秋收的同时，想尽一切办法保证了全省大部分麦田适时播种。入冬以来，旱象继续发展，全省又展开了群众性的抗旱浇麦运动。各地在去年上半年兴修的各种小型农田水利工程，这时就首次发挥了灌溉的效能。过去没有灌溉习惯的南阳专区，农业社第一次平整土地，添购水车，灌溉了应当灌溉的麦田面积的80％以上。在水利条件较好的新乡专区，去年冬季灌溉过的麦田比1955年冬季增加一倍多。今年1月中旬全省普遍降雪以后，各地又都掀起了麦田积雪的热潮。洛宁县农民在“一担雪、一担粮”的口号鼓舞下，平均每个劳动力向麦田里运雪达五十担。
    在抗旱保苗的同时，各地农业社还给麦苗追施了肥料。信阳专区的五百一十二万亩麦田，平均每亩追施了六千斤肥料。许昌专区追施过肥料的麦田，平均每亩施了三大车。这些肥料大部是功效很高的厩肥和人粪尿等，质量远远超过往年。
