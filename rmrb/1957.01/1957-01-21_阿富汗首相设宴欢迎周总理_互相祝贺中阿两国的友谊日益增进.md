Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, January 20th -- When the Prime Minister of Afghanistan and the Premier of China spoke at a banquet on January 19th evening, they both particularly emphasized promoting mutual understanding and cooperation.

Prime Minister Daud Khan of Afghanistan held a banquet at the Forty Columns Palace in Kabul last night to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai. This building was only recently completed, and many people consider it very meaningful that this time the first official banquet was held here to welcome envoys of goodwill and friendship. The embroidery of King Zahir Shah's portrait embroidered by Chinese artists and hung in the hall attracted the attention of the guests and received much praise.

Prime Minister Daud Khan delivered a speech at the banquet, welcoming the Chinese guests. He pointed out that Afghanistan has maintained close trade and cultural ties with China for hundreds of years. In the past contacts between the peoples of the two countries, there has never been damage caused by differences and animosity.

He said that neutrality is Afghanistan's traditional national policy. We believe that this policy, which is in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, is an ideal moral foundation for promoting peace and understanding among all countries in the world, and is a factor for the security and prosperity of our own people. He also said that adherence to the principles of the Bandung Conference can not only guarantee the happiness and prosperity of member states, but also is an important factor for world security and the prosperity of all mankind.

When Premier Zhou Enlai spoke, he also pointed out that in the relations between China and Afghanistan, there has never been war or conflict, only friendship and sympathy. After the people of the two countries freed themselves from the shackles of colonialism, the friendly relations between the two countries are developing on a new basis.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that the Chinese people highly respect Afghanistan's policy of friendship with all countries on the basis of mutual respect. The Chinese people greatly admire Afghanistan's just position in supporting Egypt in resisting aggression. The Chinese people also especially thank Afghanistan for the support it has given us in the issue of restoring the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that the Chinese people have always advocated developing friendly relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and pay special attention to friendship and cooperation with neighboring countries. We are very pleased to see that the relations between China and Afghanistan have had good development on the basis of mutual respect.

After the banquet, Premier Zhou Enlai went among senior Afghan officials and military officers as well as diplomatic corps personnel and talked with many people. The Egyptian Ambassador to Afghanistan, Karara, thanked Premier Zhou Enlai for specifically mentioning Egypt in his speech. Premier Zhou Enlai replied: Egypt has been standing at the forefront of the opposition to colonialism since the Bandung Conference, and it is Egypt that should be thanked. At this time, the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to Afghanistan, Fuad Khatib, interjected and said, and Egypt's struggle has also achieved victory. The three people laughed heartily together.
