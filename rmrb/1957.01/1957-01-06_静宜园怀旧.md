Nostalgia for Jingyi Garden
    侯岱麟

    I remember in elementary school there was a teacher who was very considerate of us children, repeatedly assigning the topic "Remembering Childhood" several times a semester. At first, everyone was quite interested, but later it became boring because we were only about ten years old at the time, and it was really hard to find outstanding and beautiful material to write about childhood so often at that age. For example, getting beaten, which is indeed a lot and very deep in children's memories, but who would be interested in writing about such unpleasant and unseemly things? In desperation, we had to make things up. Once, I made up a short story about catching crickets, roughly: In early autumn, my sister and I went to play in the meadow and accidentally touched a half-rotten brick under the grass, suddenly startling a small grasshopper, which was frightened and jumped around wildly. "What is this? So small, and it can jump?" I thought to myself, and subconsciously bent down, stretched out a small, dirt-stained palm, tiptoed toward it, my sister quietly following behind. Later, I crawled on the grass and pounced several times without catching it, completely forgetting that I had just put on a new pair of pants today. Finally, I calmed down, and with a sudden lunge, smack, I hit the shiny, black, jumping grasshopper with my palm, and couldn't help but shout happily, "Sister, come here, I caught it!" Who knew she was jumping and clapping behind me! I carefully, slowly opened my palm and looked, uh! It was flat. How disappointing! My sister pouted and followed beside me, I lowered my head and looked at my new pants, walking home dejectedly.

    This was more than twenty years ago, and I hadn't thought about it for more than twenty years. Unexpectedly, recently I read in the newspaper that Jingyi Garden in Xiangshan was open to the public, which brought me back to the hazy dream of more than twenty years ago.

    At the northeastern foot of Jingyi Garden in Xiangshan is my alma mater, "Xiangshan Children's Welfare Institute." It taught me many skills and interesting knowledge: the history class contained many small stories and big stories. The impression "Battle of Feishui" gave me has not been forgotten to this day; geography class was like traveling around the world, reaching the Alaska Peninsula without leaving the classroom, riding a dog-pulled sled, galloping on the vast, snow-covered plain. The next day, I ran to the tropical ocean, and suddenly a flying fish jumped out, skimming over the desk. How I wished it could land on my little deck! However, what I liked most was natural science class. Actually, I wasn't interested in the natural science textbook. What I liked was going to Jingyi Garden to collect specimens.

    In order to go to Jingyi Garden, I often stared blankly at the campus wall. I thought: how spacious and free it would be if all the walls in the world were pushed down! People create walls like silkworms create cocoons, limiting themselves, how boring. I instinctively climbed the wall to break free, climbed, climbed, and climbed with all my might, but I didn't climb out. Instead, I was caught by the "gentle" training director and given a good beating with a board.

    The wall prevented me from going to Jingyi Garden, and the "training" board threatened me from trampling on the wall's back again, but I still wanted to go out. Once, I fantasized in front of the wall's door: I stood in front of the door like an ancient magician, pinching my fingers, muttering spells learned from fairy tales, eagerly hoping for the tightly closed door, expecting it to suddenly open wide. Unexpectedly, after chanting spells for a long time, the door remained coldly closed. I couldn't help but feel resentful: "Stupid wood, not even as good as stone!" From then on, I changed my mind in natural science class, proposing to collect specimens more than once. I thought: I don't need you to agree every time, I'll be happy as long as you agree once. In the end, my wish came true.

    Although I proposed to collect specimens, I collected the least. Once out of the campus, I was like a little leopard out of a cage, jumping and leaping under the pine forest. I ran to the Water Curtain Cave above the source of Glasses River to collect stalactites. Water rushed down from the top of the Water Curtain Cave, and the water droplets burst into lines, truly like pearl curtains. I was afraid that the teacher would come looking for me, so I knocked on the stalactites while scouting outside, but the misty water curtain obscured my view, making me feel uneasy, so I kept hurriedly knocking around. Who knew I had broken all the stalactites, what use was that? So I ran out, bypassed the small family, and ran into Jianxinzhai; after leaving Jianxinzhai, I circled the green glazed pagoda a few times, without seeing anything special, and then crossed Xiangshan Sanatorium, aimlessly wandering in the jungles and valleys. Of course, I still remembered to collect something. But when I looked at the collection time, the girls had the biggest harvest. They collected many beautiful butterflies, colorful mountain flowers, and strange wild grasses, and also had pockets full of fat pine nuts; and what about me? Apart from the two crickets hidden in the paper tube, I could only hand in a small piece of quartz. However, I was satisfied with this visit to the garden.

    On the evening of the same day I came back from collecting specimens, I got a paper box, lined it with a thick layer of soil, put the crickets inside, and stuffed it under the bed before going to sleep. I didn't have any dreams, but an unexpected "nightmare" woke me up from my deep sleep. It turned out that our beautiful, but not gentle, female dormitory teacher was holding a board and hitting my butt! I woke up in shock, hiding in the corner of the bed against the wall, my body curled up like a fetus, looking at her with fear and hate, she dragged the paper box out from under the bed aggressively, pointed at my nose with the board and said: "What is this thing you brought back? You wretched little devil!" With a wave of her hand, she threw my paper box out the window. None of my roommates heard the crickets singing, but they were awakened by the unpleasant sound of the wooden board hitting my butt. No one dared to breathe loudly, but as soon as she left, everyone looked at me and giggled quietly.

    I couldn't fall asleep for a long time, tossing and turning, thinking: Didn't the homeroom teacher tell us that hitting and scolding people are not good behaviors?

    Now that I'm older, I can recall many childhood stories. Writing at random, I end up not writing about good things, but writing about fragments of trivial things about being beaten, which I didn't want to write about in the first place, thinking about it makes me laugh. I hope that the children now don't have this kind of memory like me; I hope that the teachers now are as beautiful as Jingyi Garden, so that the children who have grown up will always remember you.

    静宜园怀旧
    侯岱麟
    记得小学里有一位很能体贴小学生的老师，一学期中重复几次地写出“忆儿时”的题目。起初大家还很感兴趣，到后来也就兴味索然了，因为我们那时也不过才十岁左右，以这样的年纪经常回忆儿时，的确很难找出出色漂亮的材料。譬如挨打吧，在儿童记忆里确是很多，也很深，但谁又有兴致写这种不愉快又不体面的事情呢？不得已，只好瞎凑。有一回，我凑了一小段捉蟋蟀的故事，大意是：初秋时节，我同妹妹到草地里去玩，无意中碰了草下的半块烂砖头，猛然惊起一只小草虫，它被吓得乱跳乱窜。“这是什么呀？这样小，还会蹦？”我心里一面想，一面下意识地弯下腰去，伸出一只沾有泥土的小手掌，蹑着脚向它追去，妹妹也在后面悄悄地赶来。后来我又爬在草地上，连续地扑了几次都没扑着，完全忘记了今天才穿上一条新裤子。最后，我沉住气，唬地往前一纵身，啪的一掌，打在那只乌黑油亮的能跳的小草虫的身上，快乐地不由得叫起来：“妹妹来呀，我捉住了！”那知她正在我背后跳着拍手喊好呢！我小心翼翼地、慢慢地翻开小手掌一看，呀！它成了扁的啦。真扫兴！妹妹咕嘟着嘴跟在我的身旁，我低着头望着新裤子，没精打彩地走回家去。
    这已是二十多年以前的事了，二十多年来没有想起过，不料近日读报，看到了香山静宜园开放的消息，才又把我引回到二十多年以前的朦胧梦境里。
    香山静宜园的东北脚下，有我的母校“香山慈幼院”。它教给我很多本领和有趣的知识：历史课里蕴藏着许许多多的小故事，大故事，“淝水之战”给我的印象，到现在还没有忘掉；上地理课真像周游列国一样，不出教室就到了阿拉斯加半岛，乘着狗拉的雪橇，奔驰在白茫茫的一望无垠的雪原里。过了一天，又跑到了热带的海洋里，突然窜出一条飞鱼，掠过书桌，我多么希望它能落在我这块小甲板上呀！然而，最使我喜欢的还是自然课。其实，我对自然课本并不感兴趣，我所喜欢的是到静宜园里去采集标本。
    为了要到静宜园去，我常常对着校园的围墙发呆。我想：如果把世界上所有的墙壁都推翻，该有多么空阔、自由！人造了墙就像蚕造的茧，自己限制自己，多没意思。我曾为了要冲出墙去，本能地往墙上爬，爬，使劲爬，结果没爬出去，却被那表面看来还“温文尔雅”的训育主任抓回去，切实地打了一顿板子。
    墙限制着我不能到静宜园去，“训育”的板子威胁着我不能再践踏墙的脊背，可是我仍然想出去。有一次我对着围墙的门发出幻想：我像古代魔术师一样地站在门前，掐着手指，口里咕噜着从童话中学来的咒语，热望那紧闭的门，期待它豁然洞开。想不到念了半天咒，那门依然冷冷地紧闭着。我禁不住怨愤起来：“愚蠢的木头，连石头都不如！”从此以后，我才在自然课上转念头，不只一次地提议去采集标本。心里想：不用每次都答应，只要答应一次我就喜欢。结果，还是如愿了。
    虽然是我提议去采集标本，可是我采集的最少。出了校园，就像小豹子出了笼一样，在松林下又窜又跳。我跑到眼镜河水源上的水帘洞里去采钟乳石，水从水帘洞顶上奔泄下来，水珠迸散成一条条的线，真像是珍珠帘。我怕老师追来找我，一边敲钟乳一边向外侦视，可是那水雾迷蒙的水帘又隐蔽着使我看不清楚，心里实在不踏实，就不住地匆忙乱敲，那知钟乳都让我敲碎了，这还有什么用？于是我跑出来，绕过小家庭，跑进见心斋；出了见心斋又围着绿琉璃塔转了几转，也没看出个名堂，就又越过香山疗养院，毫无目的地游荡在丛林溪壑中。当然，也还想起要采集点什么东西的。但到集合的时候一看，女生的收获最大，她们采集了很多美丽的蝴蝶，色彩鲜艳的山花和奇异的野草，而且还有装满了衣服口袋的肥实的松子；而我呢？除了藏在纸筒里的两只蟋蟀而外，只能交出一块小小的石英石。然而，我已满足了这一次的游园。
    采集标本回来的当天晚间，我弄来了一个纸盒子，里面铺了一层厚实的泥土，把蟋蟀撒在里面，塞在床底下就睡了。我什么梦也没有作，竟有意外的“噩梦”把我从酣睡中惊醒。原来是我们那位爱漂亮的、但并不温柔的女舍监老师，正举着板子打我的屁股呢！我惊醒起来，惶惑地躲在靠墙的床角间，身子拘缩得像个胎儿，又是怕又是恨地望着她，她气势汹汹地从床底下拉出那只纸盒子来，用板子指着我的鼻子说：“这是弄来的什么东西？该死的小鬼！”说着一挥手，就把我的纸盒子扔出窗外去了。和我同室的同学谁也没听见蟋蟀的歌唱，却被她那不悦耳的木板打屁股的声音给吓醒了，谁也没敢大声喘口气，可是她刚一出门，大家就望着我嗤嗤地小声地笑起来。
    我有好半天没有睡着，翻来复去地想：级任老师不是对我们说，打人骂人都不是好行为吗？
    现在年龄大了，可以回忆许多儿时的故事了，信笔一写，偏又不写好事，竟把当初不愿写的挨打的片断琐事写出来，想想也觉好笑。但愿现在的孩子们不再像我似的有这一类的记忆；但愿现在的老师都像静宜园一样美丽，让长大了的孩子永远怀念着你们。
