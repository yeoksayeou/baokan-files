Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd: A People's Liberation Army relief medical team, recently returned from completing its mission, treated more than 8,600 patients free of charge in the disaster areas of Fucheng and Jingxian counties in Hebei Province, starting in late September last year. They brought back the gratitude and praise of the people.

	This relief medical team, composed entirely of military medical personnel, went deep into the rural areas for more than three months, investigated illnesses, and diagnosed and treated patients door-to-door. Regardless of day or night, they would immediately make house calls whenever there were patients. Sometimes they would set out after breakfast and work until 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening before having their second meal. While diligently treating the disaster victims, they also carried out propaganda work, greatly encouraging the disaster victims' enthusiasm for production and self-salvation.

    一支为灾民免费治病的解放军医疗队
    据新华社3日讯　最近完成任务回来的一支中国人民解放军救灾医疗队，从去年9月下旬起深入河北省阜城、景县一带灾区，共免费治好了八千六百多个病人。他们带回了人民的感激和赞扬。
    这支全部由军队的医务工作者组成的救灾医疗队，在三个多月中，深入农村，调查病情，挨门逐户地诊断治疗；不论白天黑夜，只要有病人就立即出诊。有时早饭后出诊，一直工作到晚上八、九点钟才吃第二顿饭。他们一面勤勤恳恳地给灾民治病，一面进行宣传工作，大大鼓励了灾民生产自救的热情。
