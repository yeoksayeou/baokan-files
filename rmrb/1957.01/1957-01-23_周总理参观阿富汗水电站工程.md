Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, January 22nd – Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice-Premier He Long, and their entourage visited the Sorobi Hydroelectric Power Station project on January 21st. This is one of the massive projects Afghanistan is building in a topographically complex area.

This hydroelectric power station began construction at the end of 1951 with technical assistance from West Germany. It is located in the gorge of the lower Kabul River, about eighty kilometers east of Kabul. The hydroelectric power station will be completed in another two months, at which time it will be able to generate 22,000 kilowatts. This is more than double Afghanistan’s current power generation and will serve as a power source for industrial development and the city of Kabul. A group of Soviet experts is currently drafting a specific plan to build another dam ten kilometers upstream of the hydroelectric power station using local materials, which will enable Afghanistan to obtain another 22,000 kilowatts of electricity.

It is said that four such projects can be built along this river.

The West German chief engineer used a chart to explain the construction of this project to the Chinese guests. Soviet experts also explained the dam construction plan to the guests. Premier Zhou Enlai raised many practical questions about these projects and had a long conversation with the German engineer, who had once worked in Fujian, about the problem of sedimentation in the reservoir lake. The German engineer said that no satisfactory solution to this problem has been proposed in the world to date. Premier Zhou Enlai said, "This is also a big problem in China." Zhou Enlai and his party, led by the chief engineer, visited the sluice gates, tunnels, and power station.

The Chinese guests' motorcade traveled from Kabul to Sorobi for more than two hours. They drove along the banks of the Kabul River, passing through the vast Kabul Basin surrounded by small mountains covered with snow, as well as fields covered with snow, many mud houses with high walls, and caravans consisting of Bactrian camels and donkeys.

This road was entirely built by Afghanistan itself and was carved out of steep cliffs. The road was sometimes close to the river and sometimes climbed to dizzying heights.

In several places, villagers wearing headscarves and shawls gathered by the roadside and raised their hands to greet the guests. The workers at the hydroelectric power station construction site also welcomed the Chinese guests.

### 周总理参观阿富汗水电站工程

    周总理参观阿富汗水电站工程
    新华社喀布尔22日电　周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和随行人员1月21日参观了索罗比水电站工程。这是阿富汗在地形复杂的地区建设的巨大工程之一。
    这个水电站是从1951年年底开始在西德的技术援助下修建的，它位于喀布尔东约八十公里的喀布尔河下游的峡谷中。再过两个月，水电站就要完工了，那时能发电二万二千瓩。这比阿富汗目前发电量要多一倍以上，它将作为工业发展和喀布尔市的动力来源。有一批苏联专家正在拟订具体计划用当地材料在水电站上游十公里处另外建筑一个水坝，它将使阿富汗再得到二万二千瓩的电。
    据说沿着这条河可以修建四座这样的工程。
    西德总工程师用一个图表向中国客人们说明建设这个工程的情况。苏联专家也向客人们说明了筑坝的计划。周恩来总理提出了许多关于这些工程的实际问题，并且同这位一度曾经在福建工作过的德国工程师就防止蓄水湖沉淀的问题进行了长时间的交谈。这位德国工程师说，世界上迄今还没有对这个问题提出令人满意的解决办法。周恩来总理说：“这也是中国的一个大问题。”周恩来等一行人在总工程师的引导下，参观了水闸、隧道和发电站。
    中国客人的车队从喀布尔到索罗比共行驶了两个多小时。他们沿着喀布尔河岸走，经过了复盖着皑皑白雪的小山所环抱的广阔的喀布尔盆地，也经过了为积雪掩盖的田野、许多筑有高墙的泥屋，以及由单峰骆驼和毛驴组成的商队。
    这条公路完全是阿富汗自己修筑的，是沿着峭壁开出来的，道路一会儿紧靠着河边，一会儿又爬到令人眩目的高处。
    在好几个地方，扎着头巾、包着围布的村民聚在路边，举起手来向客人们致意。水电站工程工地的工人们也对中国客人们表示欢迎。
