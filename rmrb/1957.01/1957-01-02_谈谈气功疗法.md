    Talking about Qigong Therapy
    Xu Yulin
    The so-called "Qigong" now, is also called internal kung fu, or internal alchemy, or quiet cultivation guidance, breathing exercises, etc. with different names, and there are various cultivation methods. Because the ancients systematically studied the relationship between adjusting "breathing" and improving physical health, preventing diseases, and prolonging life from daily life, most of the cultivation methods are related to breathing, and are collectively called Qigong. Ancient Chinese physicians had unique research on Qigong. Although the term "Qigong" is rarely seen in Chinese medicine books, there are many places that talk about the principles of Qigong. Traditional Chinese medicine has always attached great importance to Qi transformation in treating diseases. For example, the Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine says: "To treat diseases, one must seek the root," and "All diseases are born of Qi." The so-called "Qi" here refers to the external "six Qi" (wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, fire) that the human body feels and the internal "seven emotions" (joy, anger, sorrow, worry, fear, fright, thought) of the human body. For example, when it comes to regulating Qi, there is the Great Treatise on Regulating the Spirit with Four Qi; when it comes to unblocking Qi, there is the Treatise on the Flow of Life Qi. Other things such as how to confirm the relationship between pulse and disease through breathing and how to achieve "getting rid of the old and embracing the new" (i.e. metabolism) are discussed separately in the Treatise on the Pulse of Ordinary People and the Treatise on Shifting Essence and Changing Qi. Because Chinese physicians deeply realized that in addition to diet, attention should also be paid to adjusting "Qi" and "blood" to improve human health and maintain and prolong human life, the main theory of ancient Chinese medicine is also based on "Qi" and "blood."
    Not only doctors, but also Confucian, Buddhist, and Taoist scholars attach great importance to the study of Qigong. In many works, you can find words about practicing stillness and nourishing life. Mencius said: Qi "is nourished directly without harm." The so-called direct nourishment is to make breathing follow nature; Lao Tzu said: "Continuous existence, use it without diligence," which means that breathing should be natural when opening and closing, and the breath should be changed from coarse to fine, from fine to subtle, continuous; Zhuangzi said: "The breath of a true person is with the heel, and the breath of the crowd is with the throat," which means that people who can protect their health generally breathe deeply and long, and when the skill reaches the extreme, it can reach the heel (that is, body breathing). People who are generally weak breathe short and shallow, and can only reach the throat; the Diamond Sutra says: "One should abide nowhere and produce the mind," which means to eliminate distracting thoughts, harmonize breathing, and make the mind bright and pure. The famous doctor Hua Tuo said, "Breathing guidance, exhaling the old and taking in the new, is for longevity," which further explains the principle of using appropriate breathing to promote blood circulation and prolong life. In addition, the works of Zhou Lianxi, Wang Yangming, Zhang Sanfeng, Sun Simiao, Ma Danyang, and others also mention the role of Qigong in many places. Later, there are more and more schools of Qigong, but no matter which school it is, most of them use breathing exercises as a starting point.
    The practice of Qigong therapy does not necessarily pay attention to posture (but some believe that posture must be paid attention to in clinical treatment of diseases). It can be done whether living, walking, sitting, or lying down. Generally, there are sitting and lying postures. Sitting postures are divided into double lotus, single lotus, natural lotus, and flat sitting; lying postures are divided into supine, left lateral, and right lateral, and sitting postures are the most common. But no matter which method is adopted, a special state of alertness must be maintained when practicing. Therefore, the environment, method, and content of the exercise must be based on the formation of this state. That is to say, the environment for practicing should be quiet, the mind should be concentrated when practicing, and attention should be paid to regulating breathing. The so-called concentration is to eliminate distracting thoughts, to achieve no hearing, no sight, and a peaceful mood. At this time, it may be because most of the cerebral cortex is in an inhibited state, which in turn allows it to use the opportunity to rest to repair its own mechanism. At the same time, it may also be because the connection between the cerebral cortex and local lesions is temporarily cut off, which may stop the vicious cycle formed by pathological stimulation and reflection, and enhance the recovery ability of local tissues. The so-called regulating breathing is to promote metabolism in the body. Due to the special and regular breathing exercises under specific Qigong methods, several foci of excitation are raised in the cerebral cortex, and these foci of excitation affect the subcortical centers (mainly the internal organs) to produce excitement, which results in stimulating the functions of digestion, circulation, respiration, hematopoiesis, endocrine and other organs, nutrition, exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen, and metabolism, so that tissue regeneration function, physique, physical strength, etc. are also improved. However, it should be noted that only paying attention to adjusting breathing will not achieve the above effects. Breathing must be adjusted while entering stillness, because only by improving the nervous system mechanism first can the function of the nervous system be supported in turn. We know that under the command and restraint of the nervous system, various organs are interrelated, interdependent, and mutually constrained. Because of this, the subcortical center of the cerebral cortex builds a new benign connection through continuous practice. On the one hand, it sends out reflexes, and on the other hand, it receives the stimulation of practice operations and physical signs. This new benign connection gradually replaces the vicious cycle of lesions through repeated operations. That is to say, by practicing, the overall concentration of strength is strengthened to overcome the lesions that occur in the local part of the whole.
    In short, Qigong therapy is a method in which people use the inherent physiological properties of the unified and complete organism itself, use concentrated thinking and adjusted breathing to create an artificial "protective condition," and at the same time create a condition of "overall strengthening," and combine them for health care and treatment. It can be said that Qigong therapy is a good overall self-healing method.
    Many facts have proven that Qigong therapy has better effects on chronic diseases that general medicine cannot or cannot easily cure, such as neurasthenia, peptic ulcer, gastric ptosis, and sexual dysfunction. However, the use of Qigong therapy should generally be carried out under the guidance of Qigong experts and doctors. If it is blindly tried, it may also cause dizziness, eyes looking up, and blood going up, etc.
    Methods of cultivating the body and mind like Qigong were used by the ancients as personal cultivation. Now, we should explore, study, and sort out this valuable heritage left by our ancestors, and promote it so that everyone can use Qigong therapy to exercise their bodies, prevent and treat diseases, and better serve socialist construction.

    谈谈气功疗法
    徐玉林
    现在所谓的“气功”，或叫内功，或叫内丹，或叫静养导引、吐纳法等等不同的名称，而且有多种多样的修养方法。由于古人从日常生活中系统地研究了调整“呼吸”同增进身体健康、防治疾病、延长寿命之间的关系，所以绝大多数的修养方法都与呼吸有关，而统称叫气功。我国古代医家对气功有着独特的研究。虽然“气功”二字在中医书籍中不多见，但是谈到气功原理的地方特别多。中医治病一向是非常重视气化的。如黄帝内经中说：“治病必求其本”，“百病生于气”。这里所谓的“气”，是指人体所感受的外界的“六气”（风、寒、暑、湿、燥、火）和人体内在的“七情”（喜、怒、悲、忧、恐、惊、思）。又如讲到调气，则有四气调神大论；讲到通气，则有生气通天论。其他如怎样从呼吸定息以证实脉动同疾病的关系，怎样做到“去故就新”（即新陈代谢），则在平人气象论，移精变气论中都分别有所论述。由于我国医学家深刻地认识到，增进人体健康、维持和延续人的生命，除了饮食以外，还要注意调整“气”和“血”，所以我国古代的医学的主要理论，也是以“气”和“血”为基础的。
    不仅医家重视气功的研究，儒、释、道家也很重视气功的研究。在许多著作里都可以找到关于习静养生的话。孟子说：气“以直养而无害。”所谓直养，就是使呼吸循乎自然；老子说：“绵绵若存，用之不勤”，就是说呼吸时开阖自然，做到气息由粗而细，由细而微，绵绵不绝；庄子说：“真人之息以踵，众人之息以喉”，就是说一般能够保护身体健康的人，他们的呼吸深而且长，功候到极深的时候，可以到达足跟（即体呼吸），一般比较柔弱的人，他们的呼吸短而且浅，只能到达喉头；金刚经说：“应无所住而生其心”，就是说要泯除杂念，调和呼吸，使心地光明纯洁。名医华陀说，“呼吸导引，吐故纳新，为寿而已”，更进一步说明了用适当的呼吸来促进血液循环，延长寿命的道理。此外，周濂溪、王阳明、张三丰、孙思邈、马丹阳等的著作中也有不少地方谈到了气功的作用。而后，气功的派别也越来越多，但不论是那一派，大多数以练习呼吸为入手法门。
    气功疗法的修习不必重视姿式（但也有认为在临床治疗疾病时必须重视姿式的）。无论住、行、坐、卧都可以作。一般有坐式和卧式。坐式有双盘膝、单盘膝、自然盘膝、平坐之分；卧式有仰卧、左侧卧、右侧卧之分，而以坐式最为普通。但不论采用那一种方式，练功的时候都必须保持一种特殊的醒觉状态。因此，环境和练功的方法以及练功的内容都必须以这一状态的形成为依归。也就是说练功的环境要幽静，练功的时候要思想集中，同时要注意调节呼吸。所谓思想集中，就是要摒除杂念，做到耳无所闻、目无所见，心情恬淡，这时，可能是由于大脑皮层大部分处于抑制状态，进而使之利用所获得的休息的机会去进行本身机制的修复。同时，也可能是由于大脑皮层同局部病灶的联系也被暂时切断了，这就有可能中止病变刺激和反射形成的恶性循环，使局部组织的恢复能力增强。所谓调节呼吸，就是促进体内的新陈代谢。由于在特定的气功方法下进行特殊而规律的呼吸运动，这就又在大脑皮层兴起了若干的兴奋灶，这些兴奋灶又影响皮层下中枢（主要是内脏）发生兴奋现象，结果激发了消化、循环、呼吸、造血、内分泌等器官的机能、营养、二氧化炭和氧的交换和代谢作用，使组织再生机能、体质、体力等等也得到了改善。但是，应当说明，仅仅注意了调整呼吸是不会收到上述功效的，必须在入静的同时，也进行呼吸的调整，因为只有先改善了神经系统机制，才能反过来再去支持神经系统的功能。我们知道，在神经系统的指挥和节制下，各器官是互相联系、互相依赖、互相约制着的，正因为这样，大脑皮层下中枢通过不断练功，架起了一种新的良性联系，它一方面发出反射，一方面又接受练功操作和体征现象的刺激，如此反复进行，这种新的良性联系便逐渐取代了病变的恶性循环。这就是说，通过练功加强了整体集中力量去克服发生在整体局部的病变。
    总之，气功疗法是人们利用统一完整机体本身内在的生理性能，用集中思想、调整呼吸创造一个人为的“保护条件”，同时又创造了一个“整体加强”的条件，并使之结合起来，用于保健和治疗。可以说：气功疗法是一个良好的整体自医疗法。
    目前许多事实证明：气功疗法对于一般医学上不能或不易治好的慢性病，如神经衰弱、胃溃疡、胃下垂、以及性机能障碍等有着较好的功效。不过，气功疗法的使用，一般应在气功专家和医生的指导下进行，如果盲目试行，也可能引起头晕、眼睛往上看，血脉上行等毛病。
    像气功这一类的修养身心的方法，古人用来作为个人的修炼。现在，我们应当发掘、研究和整理祖先留下的这一宝贵遗产，并加以推广，使大家能运用气功疗法锻炼身体、防治疾病，更好地为社会主义建设服务。
