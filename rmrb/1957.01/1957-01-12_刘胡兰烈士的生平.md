    The 12th of January has arrived. Ten years ago today, the Party's good daughter, Liu Hulan, heroically dedicated her young life to the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people.
    Liu Hulan was from Yunzhou West Village, Wenshui County, Shanxi Province. She was born on October 8, 1932, into a middle-peasant family. Liu Hulan's birth coincided with an era in which millions of working people in our country were enduring immense suffering.
    In 1936, when Liu Hulan was just four years old, the Kuomintang reactionary government was fervently engaged in anti-communist and treasonous activities. Japanese imperialism had already crossed the Great Wall, extending the flames of aggression into the Chinese interior. In 1937, under enemy attacks, Yan Xishan, the warlord of Shanxi, collapsed without a fight, and the vast population of the central Shanxi region was plunged into deep distress. It was at this time that the Eighth Route Army, led by the Chinese Communist Party, came to the central Shanxi region and led the people of Shanxi in a heroic struggle against the enemy. In 1938, a Chinese Communist Party organization was established in Liu Hulan's hometown, Yunzhou West Village. By the time Liu Hulan was six years old, the strong struggle of the peasants of Yunzhou West Village had already troubled the enemy, and they called the village "Little Yan'an."
    Growing up in that great era, Liu Hulan received revolutionary enlightenment from an early age. The influence of the revolutionary struggle made this girl increasingly love the cause of the people's liberation. When she was only twelve years old, she asked her mother to first teach her to recognize the important characters "Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the Eighth Route Army."
    In the autumn of 1945, the Japanese invaders surrendered, and the people of Yunzhou West Village were liberated by the Eighth Route Army. At that time, thirteen-year-old Liu Hulan was tall and looked like she was seventeen or eighteen, and she was very steady in her work. She was determined to join the revolution, telling her mother, "Whenever I see West Mountain, I want to go there. It's our old base area. When I get there, I can study and work. I really want to go!" At that time, the Fifth District of Wenshui County wanted to train a group of women cadres, and Liu Hulan was determined to go to this training class to study. Although her grandmother, who loved her granddaughter dearly, tried to stop her in every way, she did not waver in her determination. On October 19, without telling her family, she quietly left Yunzhou West Village with several other women trainees to attend the women cadre training class in Nanbaizhuang, eight li northeast of the village. The training period was only a little over forty days, but it further strengthened Liu Hulan's revolutionary will.
    After returning from the training class, Liu Hulan could no longer stay at home doing nothing. She was very enthusiastic, running around for various tasks in the village. The following year, Liu Hulan was elected as the secretary (i.e., chairman) of the Yunzhou West Village Women's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, and she led the women of Yunzhou West Village in participating in the great land reform movement. In the struggle against the landlord class, Liu Hulan showed great determination and courage, and had a working style of close contact with the masses.
    While the peasants in the liberated areas were engaged in the great struggle for emancipation, the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit gangs colluded with reactionary landlords to launch an attack on the liberated areas. From then on, the soldiers and civilians of the Wenshui County liberated area launched a heroic war of self-defense. In those critical days, Liu Hulan worked even harder. She and some women cadres visited every household in the village, mobilizing the peasants to support the army and providing the People's Liberation Army with military shoes and various comfort items.
    The longer she worked, the more Liu Hulan realized the greatness of communism, and the more conscious her work became. She hoped to make more and greater contributions to the cause of communism. So, at the age of fourteen, she applied to join the Party, and this application was soon approved at the district committee meeting. In the days when she was a probationary party member, she worked even more actively. In the winter of 1946, after the troops were transferred, Yunzhou West Village became a guerrilla area, but even in that difficult and dangerous environment, Liu Hulan never wavered.
    On January 12, 1947, the Seventy-second Division, Two Hundred and Fifteenth Regiment, Third Battalion, Ninth Company of the Yan Xishan bandit army, stationed in Daxang Village, Wenshui County, suddenly attacked Yunzhou West Village, led by two bandits, Company Commander Xu Desheng and Instructor Zhang Quanbao. Fifteen-year-old Liu Hulan was unfortunately captured along with six peasants in this attack by the enemy. The enemy thought they could get useful information from this girl and that Liu Hulan would submit. They interrogated Liu Hulan in an ancient temple, but the young Liu Hulan showed the noble qualities unique to a Communist Party member. She did not give the enemy any information. The beastly Yan bandit army adopted a new method, first severely beating the six peasants with sticks, and then actually cutting them to death alive on a straw cutter. The Yan bandit army attempted to use this to threaten Liu Hulan into surrendering. At this critical moment, Liu Hulan was not only not intimidated, but stood stubbornly in front of the enemy and cursed loudly, "You bunch of beasts, I am not afraid of anything, I will never surrender. As long as I am alive, I will work!"
    Liu Hulan was sent to the execution ground. The villagers who were forced to watch were saddened and cried, and some fainted on the spot. But the strong Liu Hulan loudly asked the Yan bandit officer, "How am I going to die?" That officer said fiercely, "The same way!" At this time, Liu Hulan calmly lay down on the straw cutter. Thus, the young Liu Hulan, the good daughter of the Chinese people, died heroically. Liu Hulan used her blood to write a glorious page in the history of the Chinese people's struggle. Her life was so short, but her heroic image can never be erased from the minds of the Chinese people. After Liu Hulan's sacrifice, the Jin-Sui Branch of the Chinese Communist Party posthumously recognized her as a formal member of the Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman Mao also gave Liu Hulan the honor of "Living Great, Dying Gloriously."
    Comrade Liu Hulan has heroically sacrificed herself for the cause of the people's liberation for ten years. For ten years, the youth of the whole country have been thinking of her every moment. In factories, in the countryside, on the defense lines, and in schools, Liu Hulan's patriotism and revolutionary heroism inspire the broad masses of young people, encouraging them to forge ahead in the great cause of building the motherland.

    刘胡兰烈士的生平
    1月12日到了，十年前的今天，党的好女儿——刘胡兰为中国人民的解放事业壮烈地献出了她的年轻的生命。
    刘胡兰是山西省文水县云周西村人，1932年10月8日出生在一个中农家里。刘胡兰出生的年代正是我国千百万劳动人民忍受着无限苦难的年代。
    1936年，刘胡兰刚刚四岁的时候，国民党反动政府正在热中地干着反共卖国的勾当。日本帝国主义已经越过万里长城，把侵略的火焰引向中国的内地。1937年，在敌人的进攻下，山西的土皇帝阎锡山不战而溃，晋中地区的广大人民陷入了深重的灾难中。就在这时，中国共产党领导下的八路军来到了晋中地区，领导晋中人民向敌人展开了英勇的斗争。1938年，刘胡兰的家乡——云周西村建立了中国共产党的组织。当刘胡兰六岁的时候，云周西村农民的坚强斗争已经使敌人感到为难了，他们把这个村叫做“小延安”。
    生长在那个伟大年代里的刘胡兰，从小便受到了革命的启蒙教育。革命斗争的熏陶，使这个女孩子越来越热爱人民的解放事业。当她还只有十二岁的时候，就要求她的妈妈先教她认识“毛主席、共产党、八路军”这些重要的字。
    1945年秋天，日寇投降，云周西村人民为当时的八路军所解放。那时，十三岁的刘胡兰长得又高又大，看起来倒有十七、八岁，做起事来也很稳重了。她一心盘算着要去参加革命，她向她的妈妈说：“我一见西山就想去。那里是咱们的老根据地，到了那儿，能念书，也能工作，我真要去呀！”正在这时，当时文水县五区要训练一批妇女干部，刘胡兰下定决心要到这个训练班去学习。虽然热爱孙女儿的祖母百般阻挠，也没有动摇她的决心。在10月19日那天，她没有告诉家里的人，悄悄地和另外几个受训的妇女离开了云周西村，到村东北八里的南白庄参加了妇女干部训练班。受训时间只有短短四十多天，但是这却使刘胡兰的革命意志更加坚定了。
    刘胡兰从训练班回来以后，便再也不能呆呆地坐在家里了，她为村里的各项工作奔走，非常热情。第二年，刘胡兰被选为云周西村妇女抗日救国联合会的秘书（即主席），她领导云周西村的妇女参加了伟大的土地改革运动。在同地主阶级进行斗争中，刘胡兰表现得非常坚定、勇敢，并且有着密切联系群众的工作作风。
    解放区农民正在进行伟大的翻身斗争的时候，蒋介石、阎锡山匪帮协同反动地主向解放区发动了进攻，从此，文水县解放区的军民便又展开了英勇的自卫战争。在这些严重的日子里，刘胡兰的工作更加勤奋了，她和一些妇女干部在村里挨门逐户访问，动员农民劳军，把军鞋和各种慰问品源源地供给人民解放军。
    工作得越久，刘胡兰就越体会到共产主义的伟大，她的工作也就愈加自觉，愈希望自己在共产主义事业中作出更多更大的贡献。于是她在十四岁的时候，向党提出了入党申请，这个申请不久便在当时的区委会议上通过了。在她成为候补党员的日子里，她更加积极地工作。1946年冬天，部队转移后，云周西村变成了游击区，但是，就在那种艰难危险的环境中，刘胡兰也从来没有动摇过。
    1947年1月12日，盘据在文水县大象村的阎锡山匪军七十二师二一五团三营九连，在连长徐得胜、指导员张全宝两个匪徒的率领下，突然袭击了云周西村，十五周岁的刘胡兰在敌人的这次袭击中和六个农民一起不幸被抓住了。敌人满以为可以从这个女孩子的口里得到对他们有益的情报，满以为刘胡兰会屈服。他们在一座古庙里对刘胡兰进行了拷问，但是，年轻的刘胡兰表现出了共产党员所特有的高贵品质，她没有向敌人说出一点口供。野兽般的阎匪军采取了新办法，先把六个农民用乱棍酷打，然后竟放在铡草刀上活活铡死，阎匪军企图以此来威胁刘胡兰投降。刘胡兰在这严重的关头不仅没有被吓倒，相反地她倔强地站在敌人面前破口大骂说：“你们这群牲口，我什么也不怕，我决不投降，只要我活着，我就要工作！”
    刘胡兰被送到了刑场。被强迫来看的老乡们难过地哭了，有的人当场晕倒。但是坚强的刘胡兰却大声问阎匪军官：“我咋个死法？”那个军官凶恶地说：“一个样！”这时，刘胡兰从容地躺在铡草刀上，就这样，年轻的刘胡兰——中国人民的好女儿壮烈地就义了。刘胡兰用自己的鲜血在中国人民斗争的历史上写下了光辉灿烂的一页。她的一生如此短促，但是她的英雄的形象却在中国人民的脑海中永远不能磨灭。刘胡兰牺牲以后，当时的中国共产党晋绥分局追认她为中国共产党的正式党员，毛主席还把“生的伟大，死的光荣”的荣誉给了刘胡兰。
    刘胡兰同志为人民解放事业壮烈牺牲已经十年了。十年来，全国青年每时每刻都在想念着她。在工厂，在农村，在国防线上，在学校中，刘胡兰的爱国主义和革命英雄主义精神激励着广大青年，鼓舞着他们在建设祖国的伟大事业中奋发前进。
