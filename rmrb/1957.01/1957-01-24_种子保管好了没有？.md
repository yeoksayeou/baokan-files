　　Are the seeds being properly stored?

　　The Heilongjiang Daily published a commentary on January 17, calling on agricultural production cooperatives in various regions to learn from the past lessons of huge losses caused by improper seed storage. The commentary stated: The Xinghuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huachuan County, famous throughout the country, experienced reduced rice production last year due to severe disease. The high-quality rice seeds saved by the cooperative the previous year were spoiled during storage, and in the second year, rice with pathogens was hastily sown. The commentary stated: In 1956, Yilan County wasted more than 600 tons of grain due to the low germination rate of rice seeds and the large amount of sowing; Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative in the central township of this county found that in the spring sowing last year, 110,000 catties of rice seeds from the previous year only sprouted 60-70% due to poor storage and other reasons, and 150,000 catties did not sprout at all. They spent a lot of manpower buying rice seeds everywhere in a hurry, resulting in a loss of more than 10,000 yuan. Despite so many past lessons, the phenomenon of not paying attention to seed storage is happening again. For example, the seeds of crops such as corn, rice, and potatoes in many agricultural production cooperatives have been spoiled or frozen due to poor storage. After some agricultural production cooperatives distributed the seeds to the homes of their members, they were not inspected and no one was responsible, resulting in the seeds being spoiled. Some local seed stations were only busy with purchasing and storage at the beginning of seed selection, while neglecting to guide farmers in selecting and saving seeds for their own use. Some cooperative members have also failed to fulfill their due responsibilities for seed storage. If this situation is not changed as soon as possible, many places will repeat past mistakes and create serious obstacles to this year's grain production increase.

　　In 1957, many places in Heilongjiang Province will further expand paddy field production, but the quality of rice seeds stored throughout the province is currently low and the quantity is insufficient. If the existing seeds are spoiled or frozen again, expanding rice planting will encounter greater difficulties.

　　The commentary stated that there was a lot of rain in 1956, crops were greedy for green growth, and autumn frost and winter snow came early, resulting in excessive moisture in many seeds, which is an objective practical difficulty. However, these difficulties can be overcome, and the positive way is to strive to overcome the shortcomings in seed storage work. Discovering the phenomenon of seeds being spoiled or frozen and correcting it in time is right, but it is best to find ways to prevent it in advance. Leaders of townships and cooperatives in various regions should attach importance to seed storage work, set up special personnel in the cooperatives to be responsible for supervising and inspecting seed storage, and educate members to store seeds properly. Seed stations and technology extension stations should take on the responsibility of guiding farmers to do a good job in seed storage, and teach farmers technology, especially the technology of storing large quantities of seeds and how to prevent seed quality from deteriorating.

### 种子保管好了没有？

    种子保管好了没有？
    黑龙江日报在1月17日发表了一篇评论，要求各地农业生产合作社接受过去因为种子保管不好而造成巨大损失的教训。评论说：全国闻名的桦川县星火农业生产合作社的水稻去年因为发生了严重的病害而减产。这个社头一年留的优良的水稻种子捂坏了，第二年播种时仓促地播种了带有病菌的稻子。评论说：依兰县1956年因为稻种发芽率低播种量大而浪费的粮食有六百多吨；这个县的中心乡新民农业生产合作社在去年春天播种时发现前一年由于保管不好等原因，有十一万多斤稻种只出芽六、七成，十五万斤不出芽，在百忙中用大批人力四出购买稻种，结果，赔钱一万多元。尽管过去的教训有这么多，但是现在，不注意保管种子的现象又发生了。例如，不少农业生产合作社的玉米、水稻和马铃薯等作物种子由于保管不好而被捂坏或冻坏了。有些农业生产合作社的种子分散到各社员家去以后，没有检查，没有专人负责，结果种子捂坏了。有些地方的种子站在选种开始时只忙于收购、贮备，而忽视了指导农民选留自用种子。有些合作社社员对于保管种子也没尽到应尽的责任。如果这种情况不及早改变，很多地方将会重复过去的错误，为今年的粮食增产造成严重的障碍。
    在1957年，黑龙江省许多地方将要进一步扩大水田生产，但是，目前全省贮备的稻种质量低，数量也不足。假若现有的种子再被捂坏、冻坏，扩种水稻就会遇到更大的困难。
    评论说，1956年雨多，庄稼贪青，秋霜冬雪来得早，好多种子的水分过大，这是客观上的实际困难。但是，这些困难是可以克服的，积极的办法是努力克服在保管种子工作中的缺点。发现了种子捂坏、冻坏现象，及时纠正是对的，但是最好还是设法事前加以防范。各地乡和社的领导人应该把种子保管工作重视起来，在社里设专人负责种子保管的督促检查工作，教育社员把种子保管好。种子站和技术推广站应当把指导农民做好种子保管工作责任负担起来，教给农民技术，特别是大量保管种子和怎样防止种子质量变坏的技术。
