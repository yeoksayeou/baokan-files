    Lüda, January 12th (Reported by our newspaper) – According to the Lüda Daily, since the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee and the Lüda Municipal People's Committee took the lead in tightening office space, as of January 8th, the Xigang, Zhongshan, and Shahekou District People's Committees, as well as the Lüda Water Company and other units in Lüda, have vacated 10,300 square meters of housing. Some of the vacated houses have been allocated to employees lacking housing, while others are awaiting study for reasonable arrangement and use.

    The reason these units were able to vacate so many houses is mainly due to the education on hard work and plain living conducted among the employees. The Xigang District People's Committee vacated twenty-one rooms after careful calculation and meticulous arrangements. The study classes under each street in this district have also begun to tighten the use of housing. The Rixin Street, after learning Tianjin's "study method of rotating mornings and afternoons on one, three, five and two, four, six," now only needs nine rooms for the study class that originally occupied thirty-two rooms. According to the statistics of the nine streets in this district, the study classes have initially vacated sixty-five rooms. A certain naval unit stationed in Lüda voluntarily vacated the three hotels it originally occupied, totaling more than 1,400 square meters, and handed them over to the real estate department for separate allocation. The CPC Shahekou District Committee, the Communist Youth League Committee, and the District People's Committee, after merging offices and making reasonable arrangements, have also vacated a building that can house thirteen employee families. In addition, the Grain Bureau, the Cultural Goods Company, the Lüda Textile Wholesale Station, and other units have also appropriately adjusted the internal use of housing, solving the problem of insufficient housing for some employees.

    旅大许多单位紧缩办公用房
    腾出万余平方公尺面积的房屋
    本报讯　据旅大日报报道：自从中共旅大市委和旅大市人民委员会带头紧缩办公用房后，到1月8日为止，旅大市又有西岗、中山、沙河口等区人民委员会及旅大自来水公司等单位腾出面积一万零三百平方公尺的房屋。这些腾出的房屋有的分配给了缺房住的职工居住，有的尚待研究合理安排使用。
    这些单位所以能够腾出许多房屋，主要是由于向职工群众进行了艰苦朴素教育。西岗区人民委员会就是经过精打细算和周密安排后，腾出了二十一个房间。这个区所属各街道学习班，也开始紧缩使用房屋。日新街道由于学习了天津市的“一、三、五，二、四、六上下午轮流学习的方法”，原占用三十二间房的学习班，现在有九间就够用了。据这个区九个街道的统计，学习班初步腾出的房屋就有六十五间。驻旅大海军某部队主动地将原占用的三个旅馆一千四百多平方公尺，让出来交给了房产部门另行分配。中共沙河口区委、团委以及区人民委员会等单位，经合署办公和合理安排后，也已腾出一栋楼房，能居住十三户职工。另外，还有粮食局、文化用品公司、旅大纺织品批发站等单位，也适当地调整了内部使用的房屋，解决了部分职工住房不足的问题。
