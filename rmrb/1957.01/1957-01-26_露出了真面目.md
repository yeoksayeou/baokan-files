    Revealed Their True Colors
    Some people do not reveal their true colors when their personal interests are satisfied. Only in critical moments will their ugly, selfish true colors be exposed without reservation.
    He Fude, a cadre of the Hunan Provincial Public Security Department, was transferred to work in the countryside by the organization last December. He put forward three conditions: First, admit that he is a formal member of the Chinese Communist Party; second, guarantee that he will be sent to university next year; and third, find him a lover with a high school education. Without these three conditions, he will not go to the countryside.
    Of course, the organization would not consider such absurd demands; he probably didn't expect that his doing so was merely to achieve the goal of not going to work in the countryside. However, this proves that this person no longer has the flavor of a revolutionary cadre.

    露出了真面目
    有些人在个人利益得到满足的时候是不会暴露自己的真面目的，一到紧要关头，个人主义的丑恶的真面貌就暴露无遗。
    湖南省公安厅有一个干部叫何福德。去年12月，组织上调他到乡下去工作，他提出了三个条件：一、承认他是中国共产党正式党员；二、明年保送他读大学；三、给他找一个高中文化程度的爱人。没有这三条，就不下乡。
    当然，组织上不会考虑如此荒谬的要求；他大概也不会想不到，他所以这样作，只是为了达到不去农村工作的目的而已。不过由此证明，这个人已经没有革命干部的气味了。
