Yingtan is Expanding
    Chen Zhihui
    Yingtan is a town with convenient water and land transportation in northeastern Jiangxi. With the construction of the Yingtan-Xiamen and Nanjing-Guiyang railways, Yingtan will become a railway transportation hub linking Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and other provinces.
    Everywhere here is filled with a busy construction scene. Construction sites are scattered all over, and thousands of construction workers are filling gullies and leveling ditches. The desolate and quiet Liujia Village will be transformed into an industrial zone. At present, the seven main workshops and two material warehouses of the agricultural implement iron factory's preliminary plan have been fully started; the shuttle factory expansion project will start in the first quarter of this year; the automobile repair factory, food factory, frozen meat factory, brick and tile factory, etc. are all being actively prepared, and it is expected that these factories will be put into production by the end of this year.
    Walking two or three miles east along Liujia Village is the future political and cultural area. Among the rows of scaffolding, some walls have been built more than one person high. These are the office buildings and dormitories of the town people's committee and the CCP town committee. On a small hill to the east, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Cadre School, Yingtan Middle School, and Yingtan No. 1 Elementary School have already been built. Passing through the political and cultural area and walking towards the Xinjiang River, a tall building appears in front of you. This is the newly built Yingtan Power Plant. The director of the power plant told me: "With the development of Yingtan Town, the power supply has surged. The power generation of this new power plant is five times that of the old power plant, but it is still far from meeting the needs."
    In the eastern suburbs of Yingtan, there used to be barren hills and ridges, with layers of graves. Today, workers have opened up a wide road leading to the construction site here. The red stone building of the warehousing company has just been removed from the scaffolding, and the scaffolding for the knitwear and cultural goods company project to the east has been erected again. Last year, the town's municipal construction investment was eleven times more than the previous year. The planned 6.4-kilometer-long street, red stone sewers, water supply equipment, parks, nurseries, etc. have all been started one after another. In the road construction project, in order to speed up the road paving, the workers launched a warm labor competition, and the bulldozer workers increased from pushing 30 carts per day to 40 carts per day on the 500-meter road; the earthwork paving increased from 1 square meter per person per day to 1.5 square meters.
    Today's construction of Yingtan is just a beginning, and a better vision awaits future construction. By 1967, Yingtan, as the political, economic, and cultural center of northeastern Jiangxi, will grow to a population of 100,000. In order to meet the needs of the city, before 1958, a cinema and theater that can accommodate 1,000 people, a hospital with 400 beds, the Yingtan Hotel with 350 beds, the 2,500-square-meter Yingtan Restaurant, as well as cultural palaces, clubs, swimming pools, gymnasiums, guest houses, and other welfare facilities will be built. In order to adapt to the development needs of transportation, stations and docks will be expanded. Yingtan, this beautiful and prosperous town, is growing along with the growth of the motherland's construction cause.

    鹰潭在扩建中
    陈智慧
    鹰潭，是赣东北一个水陆交通便利的城镇。随着鹰厦、宁贵铁路的修建，鹰潭将成为联结江苏、安徽、浙江、福建、江西等省的铁路交通枢纽。
    这里到处充满着繁忙的建设景象。建筑工地星罗棋布，数以千计的劳动大军正在填壑平沟。荒凉寂静的刘家村，将变为工业区。目前，农具铁工厂初步计划建设的七个主要车间和两个材料库，已经全面动工兴建；梭子厂扩建工程，今年第一季度即可动工；汽车修配厂、食品厂、冻肉厂、砖瓦厂等都在积极筹建中，预计今年年底这些工厂都可投入生产。
    沿着刘家村向东走两三里，便是未来的政治文化区。在一排排的脚手架中，有的墙已砌到一人多高，这是镇人民委员会和中共镇委会的办公大楼和宿舍。在东面的一个小山坡上，省供销合作社干部学校、鹰潭中学、鹰潭第一小学，已经建筑起来。穿过政治文化区，向信江江边走去，一座高大的建筑物呈现在眼前，这就是新建的鹰潭电厂。电厂厂长告诉我：“随着鹰潭镇的发展，供电量激增。这个新电厂比老电厂的发电量增长五倍，可是还远远不能满足需要。”
    鹰潭东郊，过去是一片荒山野岭，坟堆层层叠叠。今天，工人在这里开辟了一条通往工地的大马路。仓储公司的红石大楼刚刚拆掉脚手架，东面的针织品、文化用品公司工程的脚手架又立了起来。这个城镇去年市政建设的投资比前年多十一倍。规划中的六点四公里长的大街、红石砌的下水道、给水设备、公园、苗圃等都已相继开工。在建筑道路的工程中，工人们为了加快铺路速度，曾掀起了热烈的劳动竞赛，推土车的民工在五百公尺的路上由每天推三十车提高到四十车；铺土方由过去的每人每天铺一平方公尺提高到一点五平方公尺。
    今日鹰潭的建设仅仅是一个开始，更美好的远景还待于未来的建设。到1967年，作为赣东北的政治经济文化中心的鹰潭将增长到十万人口。为了适应城市需要，1958年以前，还将建设能容纳一千人的电影院、剧院，具有四百张病床设备的医院，有三百五十张床位的鹰潭旅社，二千五百平方公尺大的鹰潭饭店以及文化宫、俱乐部、游泳池、体育馆、招待所等和其他福利设施。为了适应交通运输的发展需要，车站、码头均将扩建。鹰潭，这个美丽繁荣的市镇，正随着祖国建设事业的成长在成长着。
