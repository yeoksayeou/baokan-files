Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 20th - The leaders of Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan, after holding talks in Cairo, issued a communique on the 19th stating that, after discussing the general political situation, especially Arab issues, they unanimously rejected the US-proposed notion of a "vacuum" in the Middle East and decided that "Arab nationalism is the sole foundation for formulating Arab policy."

The communique stated that the leaders of the four Arab nations "are also determined never to allow their countries to become spheres of influence for any foreign power." They "have decided to oppose any attempt to infringe upon Egyptian sovereignty."

Egyptian President Nasser, Saudi Arabian King Saud, Jordanian King Hussein, and Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali also stated in the communique issued after the talks: "Regarding the occupation by Israeli forces of certain locations in the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip, the four Arab leaders believe that the occupation of even a small piece of Egyptian territory constitutes a continuation of the joint act of aggression (by Britain, France, and Israel) and places the Middle East region in the face of the most serious consequences."

The four leaders also expressed in the communique their determination to support Yemen's struggle against British aggression. The communique also stated, "The meeting decided to assist the free people of Algeria in all aspects."

The communique also stated, "The four countries requested King Saud to act as their interpreter and spokesperson." Saudi Arabian King Saud has already left Cairo for the United States on the same day, where he will hold talks with US government authorities.

Cairo Radio broadcast on the evening of the 19th that Yemeni King Ahmed had sent a telegram expressing his support for the resolutions of the four leaders' meeting.

    新华社开罗20日电　埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯和约旦四国领导人在开罗举行会谈后在19日发表的公报说，他们在讨论了一般政治局势特别是阿拉伯问题之后，一致拒绝美国提出的所谓中东“真空”的说法，并且决定“阿拉伯民族主义是制订阿拉伯政策的唯一基础”。
    公报说，四个阿拉伯国家的领袖“还决心永远不让他们的国家成为任何外国的势力范围”。他们“已经决定反对侵犯埃及主权的任何企图”。
    埃及总统纳赛尔、沙特阿拉伯国王沙特、约旦国王侯赛尼和叙利亚总理阿萨利在会谈后发表的公报还说：“对于以色列军队占领西奈半岛的某些地点以及加沙地带，四位阿拉伯领袖认为，对于埃及一小块领土的占领就是（英、法、以色列三国）共同侵略行为的继续，并且使中东地区面临着最严重的后果。”
    四国领导人还在公报中表示决定支持也门反对英国侵略的斗争。公报并且说，“会议决定在各方面帮助自由的阿尔及利亚人民”。
    公报还说，“四国要求国王沙特作为它们的解释者和发言人”。沙特阿拉伯国王沙特已在当天离开罗前往美国，他将同美国政府当局举行会谈。
