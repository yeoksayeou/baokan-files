    给约旦财政援助
    埃及同约旦达成协议
    新华社开罗14日电　据“人民报”今天报道，埃及同约旦在开罗进行的关于向约旦提供财政援助的会谈已经圆满结束，双方就各项问题达成了协议。
    “人民报”说，这是约旦高级人士13日在双方举行会议后在开罗宣布的。
    约旦政府代表团将在15日动身去沙特阿拉伯首都利雅得。以后，这个代表团还要去大马士革。他们将同沙特阿拉伯政府和叙利亚政府进行类似的谈判。
    约旦国务大臣、代表团团员阿卜杜拉·里马维说，约旦能够摆脱英国的援助，就是“在英—约条约的棺材上钉下的第一颗钉子”。这位人士说，代表团相信，将要举行的会谈会像刚刚在开罗结束的会谈一样成功。
