    Czechoslovak Ice Hockey Team Defeats Beijing Team Yesterday

    (Our Dispatch) The Czechoslovak "Banik" Club ice hockey team from Vitkovice held its first friendly match in China last night. The Czech team defeated the Beijing ice hockey team with an absolute advantage of 27 to 3.

    On the newly built East Chang'an Street ice hockey rink in front of the Beijing Hotel in the capital, sixty electric lights shone on the ice, emitting a crystal-clear light. Nearly two thousand spectators braved the biting cold to watch the "Banik" team's superb skills of international level. The Czech team's skillful individual dribbling, stopping, tackling, feinting, and shooting techniques, as well as their lightning-fast and unpredictable tactics, repeatedly received enthusiastic cheers from the audience.

    In the first period of the game, Czech center and athlete Bu·Miroslav dribbled past two Beijing defenders after the opening face-off, lifted the puck and shot, scoring the first goal. Then right winger Ba·Otliger grabbed the ball and, taking the Beijing team by surprise, shot from the center line and scored again. In this period, the Beijing team adopted a dense zone defense tactic, which affected the speed of the attack, resulting in a loss of ten goals. In the second period, the Beijing team changed to expanding the defensive zone and man-to-man marking, which timely reversed the passive situation, winning three goals and losing only seven goals. In the last period, the Czech team launched a full-scale rapid attack. The young Beijing team also resisted very tenaciously, but their physical strength and speed had significantly decreased, resulting in another ten goals lost. (Attached picture)

    捷冰球队昨胜北京队
    本报讯　捷克斯洛伐克维特科维泽市“班尼克”俱乐部冰球队昨晚举行了来我国后的第一次友谊比赛。捷队以二十七比三的绝对优势战胜了北京市冰球队。
    在首都北京饭店前面新修建的东长安街冰球场上，六十盏电灯照耀着冰面发射出晶莹的光芒，近两千名观众冒着凛冽的寒风，在这里欣赏“班尼克”队的具有国际水平的高超技艺。捷队熟练的个人带球、停球、夺球、假动作过人和射门的特技，以及闪电式的、神奇莫测的战术，连连得到观众们热烈的喝采。
    在第一局比赛中，捷队中锋、运动健将布·米洛斯拉夫在开球后，带球晃过北京队两个后卫，挑球便射，首开记录。接着右锋巴·奥特利赫夺球，趁北京队不备，在中线远射又中。北京队在这一局采用密集的区域防守战术，影响进攻的速度，结果输了十个球。第二局北京队改用扩大防守区域和人盯人的办法，及时扭转了消极被动的局面，赢了三个球，只输七个球。最后一局捷队展开全面的快速进攻，年青的北京队也是很顽强的抵抗，但是体力和速度已经显著降低，结果再负十个球。（附图片）
