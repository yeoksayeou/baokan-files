　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Electric Dispatch. By early January, about 40% of the agricultural cooperatives in Shandong Province had completed their year-end distribution work. In Liaocheng, Linyi, Tai'an and other regions where progress was faster, more agricultural cooperatives had completed their final accounting and distribution work. Judging from the results of the year-end distribution of more than 4,400 cooperatives in Liaocheng Prefecture, except for a small number of cooperatives where more members had reduced income due to severe floods, more than 80% of the members in the remaining cooperatives had increased their income.

　　After a year of labor, members of agricultural cooperatives are eager to know how their production achievements have been and how much income they can receive. The year-end distribution answered these questions, thereby greatly stabilizing the members' emotions and boosting their production enthusiasm. According to surveys in various places, the attendance rate of agricultural cooperative members has significantly increased after the year-end distribution, quickly reversing the slow progress of winter production. After the Hongqi Agricultural Cooperative in Jining County completed its distribution work, the attendance rate of male and female members reached 87%, and 420 households invested more than 11,000 yuan in the cooperative.

　　In order to do a good job in the distribution work, the grassroots organizations of the Chinese Communist Party and the cadres of agricultural cooperatives in various places generally organized visiting groups and visiting teams before the start of the distribution to visit members' families and solicit opinions. Then, based on the members' opinions, they formulated a year-end distribution plan and submitted it to the members' congress or members' representative congress for discussion and revision, so the members were very satisfied. After the end of the distribution, most agricultural cooperatives in Liaocheng Prefecture also posted the annual income and distribution status, and then the members checked and further dealt with errors and outstanding issues, so as to achieve a good start and a good end to the annual distribution work. Some agricultural cooperatives that reduced production due to disasters or other reasons also combined the distribution work with a summary of the lessons learned from last year's production reduction, and on this basis, formulated winter or this year's annual production plan, which quickly reversed the members' negative emotions and started winter production.

    山东40％农业社完成年终决分
    社员收入增多，生产情绪大大提高
    据新华社济南电　到1月上旬，山东省有占总社数40％左右的农业社已经结束了年终决分工作。进展较快的聊城、临沂、泰安等专区，结束决算分配工作的农业社更多。从聊城专区四千四百多个社的决分结果看来，除了小部分的社因为遭受严重水灾，减少收入的社员较多以外，其余的社80％以上的社员都增加了收入。
    农业社社员们在劳动了一年之后，都急于知道他们一年来的生产成绩怎样，能够收入多少。年终决分回答了这些问题，因此，便大大地安定了社员们的情绪和鼓舞了他们的生产热情。据各地调查，年终决分以后，农业社社员的出勤率都有显著提高，很快地扭转了冬季生产进展迟缓的现象。济宁县红旗农业社在作好决分以后，男女社员的出勤率达到了87％，并且有四百二十户社员向社里投资一万一千多元。
    为了做好决分工作，各地的中共农村基层组织和农业社的干部们，在决分开始前普遍组织访问团、访问队，到社员家庭访问，征求意见，然后根据社员们的意见，制定出年终决分方案，交由社员大会或社员代表大会讨论修正，因此社员都很满意。聊城专区的大多数农业社在决分结束以后，又把全年收入和分配情况张榜公布，再由社员查对，进一步处理差错和遗留问题，做到全年分配工作的善始善终。一些由于受灾或其它原因减产的农业社，还结合决分工作总结去年减产的教训，并在这个基础上制定了冬季或今年全年的生产计划，这样，也都很快地扭转了社员的消极情绪，搞起了冬季生产。
