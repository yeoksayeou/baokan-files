    Transportation Problems During the Spring Festival

    The Spring Festival is a major holiday in the lives of the Chinese people. It is customary for people to want to return home or visit relatives during the holiday. Therefore, travel during the Spring Festival becomes a concern for everyone.

    According to statistics from recent years, the number of railway passengers nationwide increases by 30% during the month before and after the Spring Festival compared to normal times. Passenger numbers on the Yangtze River routes and sea routes north of Ningbo increase by 20% to 35%, and the number of highway passengers nationwide increases by 40% to 50%. In particular, after the Spring Festival last year, the number of passengers not only did not decrease but continued to rise, resulting in crowded passenger transportation conditions. In November last year, the number of railway passengers increased by more than 4.4 million compared to the month before and after the Spring Festival last year. In the ten days before the Spring Festival, the railway transported an average of 1.3 million to 1.4 million people per day. The number of passengers is even higher in large cities and new industrial areas. Recently, a survey in Beijing of 216 universities, technical secondary schools, and ordinary middle schools, 65 government agencies, 42 construction sites, and 62 large stores found that an average of 48,000 people would need to take the train home in the ten days before this year's Spring Festival, a fourfold increase compared to the usual number of passengers.

    To transport so many passengers home to celebrate the Spring Festival in such a short period, and then transport them back to their jobs after the holiday, is a very difficult task. According to statistics, to meet the needs of passenger transportation during the Spring Festival, the railways are short more than 3,200 passenger cars, and the highways are short 3,000 vehicles. Moreover, even if so many vehicles could be added at once, the capacity of the lines would still not be sufficient. Does this mean that the country has invested too little in transportation construction in recent years? No. In recent years, transportation construction has been rapid, as people can attest from their own experiences. Taking railway passenger trains as an example, the number has more than doubled since 1950. Under normal circumstances, as long as transportation work is well organized, it can generally meet the needs. If we were to massively increase the number of vehicles simply to meet the needs of a short period during the Spring Festival, it would inevitably tie up a large amount of national capital and prevent it from achieving economic benefits. This would be contrary to the interests of building socialism, and the people would not agree to this approach. Moreover, it is not actually possible to increase so many vehicles and ships all at once.

    So, is there any way to transport more passengers home? The transportation departments have decided to reduce some freight tasks to meet the needs of passenger transportation, under the principle of ensuring the needs of key projects, key factories and mines, and the supply of goods during the Spring Festival. After tapping potential from all aspects, the capacity of maritime transportation can be increased by more than 80% compared to normal times. According to a survey in Beijing, if some vehicles from the suburbs, troops, government agencies, enterprises, and schools are mobilized to participate in urban and suburban automobile transportation, it can basically meet the needs. The railways have taken various measures, and the number of additional seats will be equivalent to 2,000 passenger cars. It can be said that the transportation departments have made their greatest efforts in tapping potential. It is now possible to guarantee that the vast majority of passengers can go home for the holiday, but it is still difficult to fully meet the needs. The railways are still short 1,000 passenger cars, the highways are also short many vehicles, the ships between Shanghai and northern Jiangsu cannot meet the needs, and the Yangtze River route from Chongqing to Yichang is short 7,000 seats. The transportation situation will be even more tense in large cities and new industrial areas such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Datong, and Baotou. We should understand the difficulties of the transportation departments and take practical actions to reduce the number of passengers during the Spring Festival.

    First, those who can avoid going home during the Spring Festival should do so. Of course, it is a good thing for families to be able to reunite during the Spring Festival. However, this is, after all, a small matter in personal life. Now that transportation is difficult during the Spring Festival, it doesn't matter if those who went home last year, or those who had family members visit them, don't go home this year. Moreover, going home once is crowded on the road, costs a lot of money, and is even more difficult if the journey is too far. There is no guarantee of returning to work on time after the holiday, so why must you go home!

    Second, all units should try to stagger the departure dates of passengers during the Spring Festival. The days before the Spring Festival are the busiest time for transportation. If everyone departs during these few days, it will be difficult to leave. Conversely, if the departure dates of passengers from various units in the same area are appropriately staggered, striving for a basically balanced number of passengers each day during the month of the Spring Festival, many more people can travel. For example, schools should try to bring forward exams if possible; some construction enterprises need to organize winter training, and the start and end dates of winter training should also take into account Spring Festival travel. This matter requires the local People's Committees to organize transportation departments and various units to jointly study and schedule specific plans.

    Third, those who have bought train or boat tickets should understand the difficulties of passenger transportation during the Spring Festival and endure some of the inconveniences during the journey. During the Spring Festival, in order to meet the needs and make up for the shortage of transport capacity, the railways plan to overcrowd each passenger train by an average of 30%, and will also use some covered wagons. Sleeper cars will also be sold as regular seats. Ships will use some cargo ships instead of passenger ships, and highways will also use some trucks. These will of course cause some inconvenience to passengers. We also hope that everyone will cooperate with the transportation departments and consciously abide by transportation order.

    Transporting as many passengers as possible is the transportation departments' inescapable duty. They have already done a lot of work. In addition to hoping that the transportation departments will ensure the effective implementation of the established measures, we also hope that they will further strengthen the organization of Spring Festival passenger transportation, accelerate the turnaround of vehicles and ships, and pay attention to safe transportation. We also hope that the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications will strictly limit the use of free tickets during the Spring Festival and start from within to lead other departments in reducing the number of passengers during the Spring Festival.

    Finally, we hope that local government agencies, enterprises, troops, and schools will allocate some vehicles to participate in Spring Festival passenger transportation. We hope that all units in major cities that hold meetings with a large number of out-of-town representatives will end the meetings as early as possible before the Spring Festival so that the representatives can return home as soon as possible. The military system has done a good job in this regard. They have decided to transfer a batch of vehicles to support the transportation departments and have decided to postpone the demobilization date of demobilized soldiers until after the Spring Festival. We hope that other departments will also adopt such a positive attitude to assist the transportation departments and do a good job in passenger transportation during the Spring Festival.

### 春节期间的交通问题

    春节期间的交通问题
    春节是我国人民生活中的一个大节日。人们的习惯，总想在假期回家或出门探亲。因此，春节期间的旅行问题就成为大家都关心的问题了。
    根据近几年的资料统计，春节前后的一个月，全国铁路的旅客比平常增加30％，长江航线和宁波以北海上航线的旅客比平常增加20％至35％，全国公路的旅客比平常增加40％至50％。特别是去年春节过后，旅客数量不仅没有减少，反而持续上升，出现了旅客运输的拥挤状况。去年11月份铁路的旅客数量，就比去年春节前后的一个月增加了四百多万人。春节前十天铁路平均每天运送一百三十万至一百四十万人。大城市、新工业区旅客数量更多。最近北京市调查了二百一十六个高等学校、中等技术学校和普通中学，六十五个机关，四十二个建筑工地，六十二个大商店，在今年春节前十天需要搭火车回家的，平均每天将达四万八千人，比平常的旅客数量增加四倍。
    要把这么多的旅客，在这么短的时间里，运送到他们的家里去过春节，节后再把他们运回工作岗位，是一件很困难的事情。据统计，要满足春节期间旅客运输的需要，铁路方面缺客车三千二百多辆，公路方面也缺汽车三千辆；而且即使车辆能一下子增加这么许多，线路的通过能力也不能满足需要。是不是这几年国家在交通运输方面的建设少了呢？不是。这几年来交通运输的建设是很快的，人们都可以从亲身体验中得到证明。拿铁路的旅客列车来说，去年就比1950年增加了一倍以上，在正常情况下，只要运输工作组织得好，一般的还是可以满足需要的。要是仅仅为了满足春节期间一个短时间的需要，就大量地增加车辆，必然会把大量国家资金积压起来，不能发挥经济效果，这是同建设社会主义的利益相违背的，人民也不会同意这种做法。况且事实上也不可能一下子增加这么多的车辆和船舶。
    那么，有没有办法多运送一些旅客回家呢？交通运输部门已经决定在保证重点工程、重点厂矿的需要和春节期间物资供应的原则下，减少一部分货运任务，来满足旅客运输方面的需要。经过从各方面挖掘潜力，海上运输方面的客位可以比平时增加80％以上。城市郊区的汽车运输，据北京市调查，如果动员一部分部队、机关、企业和学校的车辆参加，基本上也可以满足需要了。铁路方面采取了各种措施，可以增加的席位将相当于两千辆客车。在挖掘潜力中，交通运输部门可以说是已经尽了最大的努力，现在能够保证绝大多数旅客回家过节，但要全部满足需要还是困难的。铁路上还缺一千辆客车，公路上汽车也缺很多，上海至苏北间的轮船还不能满足需要，长江航线的重庆至宜昌也缺七千个席位。北京、天津、上海、沈阳、西安、兰州、大同、包头等大城市和新工业区，交通情况将更紧张。我们应该体谅交通运输部门的困难，采取实际行动来减少春节期间的旅客数量。
    第一、春节期间能不回家的，最好不回家。过春节了，一家人能够团聚在一起，当然是一件好事情。可是，这毕竟是个人生活中的小事。现在，春节期间的运输有些困难，去年回过家的，或者家里有人来探望过的，今年春节不回家，也算不得什么。况且回家一次，路上又挤，花钱也不少，特别是路程太远的，困难更多，节后准时销假也没有保证，何必一定要回家呢！
    第二、各单位把春节期间旅客的启程日期尽量要错开。春节前几天，是运输最忙的时候，如果大家都挤在这几天里动身，就很难走得了。相反地，如果把同一地区各单位要回家的旅客的启程日期适当错开，争取春节期间的一个月，每天旅客的数量基本上平衡，就可以多走很多人。比如，学校考试能够提前的，最好提前；建筑企业有一部分是要组织冬训的，冬训的起迄日期最好也照顾到春节旅行的情况。这件事，需要各地人民委员会组织交通运输部门和各个单位共同研究，排定具体的计划。
    第三、买到车票、船票的，要体谅春节旅客运输中的困难，忍受旅途中的若干不便。春节期间，为了满足需要，弥补运力的不足，铁路方面每列客车准备平均超员30％，还要使用一些棚车，卧铺车也准备改卖散座客票。轮船要用一部分货轮代替客轮，公路上也要使用一部分货车。这些当然会使旅客感到一些不便。我们还希望大家协同交通运输部门，自觉遵守交通运输秩序。
    尽可能地运送更多的旅客，是交通运输部门义不容辞的天职。他们已经做了很多工作。我们除了希望交通运输部门保证切实实现既定的措施以外，并希望他们进一步加强春节旅客运输组织工作，加速车辆和船舶的周转，注意安全运输。我们还希望铁道部和交通部在春节期间严格限制免票的使用，从内部着手，来带动别的部门，减少春节期间的旅客数量。
    最后，希望各地机关、企业、部队和学校调出一部分汽车来参加春节旅客运输。希望在各大城市召开有大批外地代表参加会议的各个单位，都在春节前尽早结束会议，让代表们早日回去。在这方面，部队系统做得很好。他们决定抽调一批车辆支援运输部门，并决定把复员军人的复员日期推迟到春节以后。希望其他部门也采取这样积极的态度，来协助交通运输部门，做好春节期间的旅客运输工作。
