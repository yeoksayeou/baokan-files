The Spring Festival, a joyous holiday that farmers particularly look forward to after a year of hard work, is fast approaching. As they paste bright red Spring Festival couplets on their doors, dress their children in new clothes, and offer sweets to relatives and friends, they will naturally think of the enthusiastic labor that urban workers have put in to help them celebrate the festival.

Two months ago, workers in Tianjin's production, trade, and transportation departments began working intensely to ensure that their farmer brothers would have a good holiday. Workers at the Zhongda Paper Mill, in order to produce more plum-red and crimson paper for farmers, increased the speed of the paper-making drying cylinder from the original four revolutions to eight revolutions, increasing the daily output of paper stock from 120 reams to 290 reams. Workers in many factories that brush and sprinkle gold on paper stock also became busy, re-reporting their production quotas, with each person averaging an extra cut of paper per day.

Workers at the Dahua Confectionery Factory, which produces large quantities of sweets for rural areas, increased their working hours every day from December 22nd to January 24th. Liu Weimin, Qin Guilin, and other workers in the candy-smashing section improved their production tools and firing methods, increasing the hourly output of candy from 325 jin to 375 jin. The entire factory increased the production of sweets supplied to rural areas by more than 20,000 jin in five weeks.

Employees of Tianjin's state-owned commercial departments made their best efforts to purchase goods needed by farmers for the Spring Festival and quickly supply them to rural areas. Last December, the Tianjin Purchasing and Supplying Station of the China Knitwear and Cotton Goods Company, under the Youth League General Branch Committee, organized a youth shock brigade to rush the organization of goods. The number of young people participating reached more than 95% of the total number of young people in the station. The shock brigade was divided into a commodity team, an acceptance team, a price team, a clearing team, a packaging team, a financial accounting team, and a support team from non-business departments, so people in all corners were mobilized. Zhang Xueming, a member of the Youth League in the commodity team, continuously studied stockpiled commodities and discovered 11,500 dozen hairbands, which he thought would be a popular item for the holiday. He immediately took the initiative to contact purchasing representatives stationed in Tianjin from sixteen regions and supplied them all. It is estimated that these beautiful hairbands can beautify the braids of 69,000 rural women. The acceptance team inspected goods at factories, the price team accelerated the time for price issuance, the financial accounting team shortened the payment time… All of these accelerated the speed of goods entering and enabled the goods to be sent to rural areas in advance.

For the past two months, workers in the railway transportation department have been busy figuring out how to transport New Year's goods as quickly as possible. They worked day and night shifts continuously, giving priority to loading and transporting New Year's goods according to instructions from above. When it snowed heavily in early January, loading and unloading workers on the railway set up tents on the carriages and platforms to continue working, but the tents could not completely block the heavy snow, so they swept the snow while loading the carriages. In order to maximize transportation potential, the loading and unloading workers at the East Freight Yard of Tianjin Station learned about the types of goods in advance, accurately calculated the size and volume of the goods packaging and the capacity of the carriages, and then determined how to match and stack them according to their experience, which improved the loading capacity of the carriages. For example, the average loading capacity of cigarettes per carriage increased from 1,050 boxes to 1,100 boxes.

From January 21st to 26th, the New Year's goods supplied to rural areas by Tianjin's knitwear and cotton goods, cultural supplies, textiles, and general merchandise purchasing and supplying stations have been shipped one after another. The total value of these New Year's goods is more than 5 million yuan more than the total value of Spring Festival materials supplied to various places last year. Among them, cloth increased by 37%, and children's toys increased by 1.1 times. The variety is also quite complete, with forty-one types of erhu alone for entertainment. Now, Tianjin's workers are working to supply the means of production and livelihood needed by farmers after the Spring Festival.

    让农民兄弟欢度春节
    新华社记者　尹崇敬　黄军
    农民们在一年辛勤劳动之后所特别期待的一个欢乐的节日——春节快来到了。当他们向门上张贴大红春联的时候，给小孩穿着新衣的时候和拿着糖果招待亲戚朋友的时候，很自然地会联想到城市职工为他们过好春节而付出热情的劳动。
    在两个月以前，天津市的生产、贸易和运输部门的职工，就开始为农民弟兄过好节日而紧张工作。中达造纸厂工人为了给农民生产更多的梅红纸和丹红纸，把造纸烘缸的转速由原来的四转加快到八转，使纸料的日产量从一百二十令提高到二百九十令。为纸料刷色和洒金的许多工厂的工人也跟着忙碌起来，他们重新自报生产定额，每人每天平均要多刷一刀纸。
    为农村大量生产糖果的大华糖果厂的工人，从12月22日到1月24日，每天都增加了工作时间，砸糖工段工人刘伟民、秦桂林等改进了生产工具和烧火方法，使糖果每小时的产量从三百二十五斤提高到三百七十五斤。全厂在五个星期内就增产了供应农村的糖果两万多斤。
    天津市国营商业部门的职工尽最大的努力采购农民春节需要的商品，并且迅速供应到农村。去年12月间，青年团中国针棉织品公司天津采购供应站总支委员会组织了一支青年突击队，突击组织货源。参加的青年达全站青年总数的95％以上。突击队分设了商品队、验收队、物价队、清仓队、包装队、财务会计队和非业务部门的支援队，于是，各个角落的人们都动员起来了。商品队的青年团员张学明不断研究仓存积压商品，发现了一万一千五百打发带，他想到这正是节日需要的热货，随即主动和十六个地区驻天津的采购代表联系，全部供给了他们。据计算，这些漂亮的发带，可以让六万九千个农村妇女的发辫美化起来。验收队下厂检验商品，物价队加速了价格下达的时间，财务会计队缩短了付款时间……所有这些都加快了进货速度，使商品提前发往农村。
    铁路运输部门的工人，两个月来一直忙着怎样尽快地把年货运送出去。他们日夜轮班不间断地工作着，根据上级指示把年货优先装车运出。1月初下大雪的时候，铁路上的装卸工人在车厢和月台上搭起帐篷继续工作，但帐篷不能完全挡住大雪，他们就一边扫雪一边装车。天津车站东货场的装卸工人为了发挥运输潜力，事先了解货物的种类，精确计算货物包装的大小体积和车厢的容积，然后根据自己的经验，确定怎样搭配码垛，提高了车厢的装载量，如卷烟每车平均装载量由一千零五十箱提高到一千一百箱。
    从1月21日到26日，天津市的针棉织品、文化用品、纺织品和百货等采购供应站供应农村的年货，已经先后运送完毕。这些年货总值比去年供应各地的春节物资的总值多五百多万元。其中布匹增加了37％，儿童玩具增加了一点一倍。品种也相当齐全，单是娱乐用的胡琴类就有四十一种。现在，天津市的职工们，又在为供应农民春节以后所需要的生产和生活资料而工作着。
