Britain's "Favors" to India
--Reading Prime Minister Nehru's "The Discovery of India"--
Long Zhang

On December 9th, during Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India, at a press conference held in Calcutta, a BBC reporter asked: "After the Premier's current visit to India, does he believe that Britain did more harm than good to India, and if so, in what way?" Premier Zhou smiled and said, "This question should be answered by our Indian friends. But I can tell you about the evils left behind by colonialism in China...."

When the news was published in the newspaper, I was reading Jawaharlal Nehru's "The Discovery of India." From this book, I found the answer to this question.

Economic Poverty and Backwardness

From the early 17th century when the East India Company obtained permission from the Mughal Emperor to establish a factory in Surat, until India's independence in 1947, Britain plundered and ruled India for more than three hundred years.

British colonialism's plunder in India helped its industrial revolution. Nehru said: "A large part of the cost of Western Europe's transition to industrialism was paid by India, China, and other colonial countries whose economies were controlled by European powers." ("The Discovery of India," p. 390, hereinafter the same) This plunder was extremely cruel. The British historian Edward Thompson said, "The early history of British rule in India is remembered as probably the world's highest record of illegal extraction." Although India served as the wet nurse of British industry, Britain destroyed India's handicrafts and agriculture.

The British invasion bankrupted India's handicrafts, causing massive unemployment and death. The British Governor-General of India, Bentinck, said in a report in 1834: "The misery hardly finds a parallel in the history of commerce. The bones of the cotton weavers are bleaching the plains of India." British colonialism disintegrated the rural communes that had always been the economic foundation of India, losing their economic and administrative functions. In order to more cruelly exploit the peasants, British colonialism created a class that shared its interests—the landlord class. In 1793, the Governor-General of India, Cornwallis, promulgated the "Permanent Settlement" decree. This system was praised by Bentinck as "it has created a large and wealthy group of landlords—all of whom are deeply concerned with the continuation of British rule, so as to facilitate their complete control over the masses." British colonialism seriously damaged India's economy and life, "making the Indian peasant one of the poorest and most miserable figures on earth." (p. 391)

Nehru said: "Obviously, India has always possessed the abundant resources needed to develop industry—management and technical skills, skilled workers, and even some capital, although these funds continue to flow out of India." (p. 390) He also cited the fact that Indian industry had developed when the import of British goods was hindered during the First World War to prove this point. Despite this, British colonialists tried every means to restrict the development of Indian industry: "The British regarded the printing press, and indeed all machines, as dangerous and explosive to Indian thought, and under no circumstances should they be encouraged, lest they cause the spread of rebellion and the development of industry. There is a story that the monarch of Hyderabad once expressed a desire to see European machines. So the British Resident bought him an air pump and a printing press. The monarch's temporary curiosity having been satisfied, these machines were stored away along with other gifts and treasures. But when the government in Calcutta heard of this, they expressed their dissatisfaction to the Resident, and specifically condemned him for introducing a printing press into an Indian princely state. The Resident proposed that if the government wished, he would secretly destroy the machine." (p. 408)

In India, industrial development was hindered for a hundred years. Many products were not allowed to be manufactured in India. For example, during the First World War, there was a shortage of train locomotives, coaches, and freight cars, and the Tata Iron and Steel Company of India decided to manufacture locomotives and had imported machines from abroad. But when the war ended, Britain decided to continue buying British-made locomotives. The by-product of many sugar factories in India—molasses—was treated as waste. It could be made into strong alcohol with simple processing. However, because this production would affect the interests of the British Burma Oil Company, it was not allowed. It was not until the third year of the Second World War, when Burma fell and the supply of oil and gasoline was cut off, and on the recommendation of the American Grady Mission, that it was recognized that it had to be produced in India. In the past, a large number of medicines and vaccines were imported from foreign countries, and the war brought this to a halt. It was proposed that the more important medicines and vaccines could be manufactured in India. Even this initiative, which was crucial to the health and lives of the Indian people, was rejected. Industries such as shipbuilding, airplanes, and automobiles were even more strictly restricted.

Heavy Burden

The burden on the Indian people during British colonial rule was very heavy. "India had to bear the cost of conquering itself, the cost of transferring (or selling) itself from the East India Company to the British Crown, the cost of expanding the British Empire to Burma and elsewhere, the cost of sending expeditions to Africa, Persia, and other places, and finally the cost of the British preventing the Indians themselves. India was not only used as a base for the British Empire without any compensation, but it also had to further pay for the training of part of the British army in the country—these costs were the so-called apportioned costs. Indeed, Britain also asked India to pay for various expenses paid by Britain, such as the maintenance of British diplomatic and consular missions in China and Persia, the entire cost of telegraph lines from Britain to India, part of the expenses of the British Mediterranean fleet, and even the cost of London's hospitality to the Turkish Sultan." (p. 397)

India, hailed by Winston Churchill as "the brightest and most precious jewel in the British Crown," was not only economically plundered by British colonialism but also had to bear so many items of expenses, exorbitant taxes, and huge fines. Over the years, the wealth plundered by British colonialism from India is incalculable. However, during the Second World War alone, "the actual war costs borne by India in five years greatly exceeded the total investment of Britain in India for more than a hundred years." (p. 668) As for the "benefits" that British colonialism brought to the Indian people, it was: "The hunger, famine, epidemics, weakness, reduced resistance, stunted growth, and death from hunger and disease of the vast number of people in India." (p. 668)

Famine, Massacre, Suppression

In the early days of British colonial plunder in India, the Great Famine of 1766-1770 was caused, which starved to death more than one-third of the residents of Bengal and Bihar. The Bengal famine of 1943-1944 starved to death another 3.4 million people, while it was discovered that 46% of the residents of Bengal suffered from severe diseases during this period. --The lowest figure published by the British official investigation team in 1945 was 1.5 million people directly died from this famine.

The Indian people could not endure the exploitation and rule of colonialism, and successively broke out many uprisings and anti-British movements, but they were all suppressed by British colonialism with inhumane massacres, arrests. Taking the large-scale uprising in 1857 alone, the number of people massacred is impossible to calculate. Nehru said: "The days of Timur [Note 1] and Nadir Shah [Note 2] are still in people's memories, but the new terror caused by the British, due to their wide scope and long duration, has overshadowed their great achievements. Officials allowed looting for a week. But the actual looting continued for a month, and was carried out along with massacres." (p. 425) In order to suppress the resistance of the Indian people, British colonialists often carried out large-scale arrests. Between 1940 and 1941 alone, 30,000 leaders of the nationalist movement were arrested and imprisoned. Millions of people were arrested and imprisoned for giving speeches or other activities. On August 9, 1942, a large-scale arrest was implemented throughout India, causing national dissatisfaction, mass demonstrations, boycotts of British goods, strikes, and protests against this arrest. The British dispatched military police to shoot at the masses, and also used aircraft to strafe at low altitude. The British government announced: In addition to often shooting at the masses from moving military trucks, the military police shot at the masses at least 538 times; 1,028 people were shot and killed by the military police, and 3,200 were injured. --Just like after the Kowloon riots, the British government always underestimated the actual number of deaths and injuries. After this unrest, special courts sentenced thousands of people to long-term imprisonment, and many people were sentenced to death. In the countryside, some entire villages were convicted, from flogging to the death penalty, and the entire villages were fined 9 million rupees.

Divide, Provoke, Alienate

In order to weaken the nationalist movement and facilitate the rule of British colonialism, Britain implemented a policy of division, provocation, and alienation in India. Six hundred and one princely states were scattered throughout the country. Most of the princely states could not even maintain a semi-independent economic state. All planned economic and cultural progress was difficult, and they could only survive by relying on British colonialism. Britain promoted infighting and discord, encouraged one group to oppose another, encouraged divisive tendencies caused by religion or provinces, and encouraged slogans and actions loyal to race and sect.

We can see the miserable situation caused by the British colonialism deliberately retaining the Indian caste system from the novel "Untouchable" by the Indian progressive writer Mulk Raj Anand. Anand's other novel "Coolie" reveals the bloodshed of sectarian conflicts caused by British colonialism in ruling India. This trick was used to deceive the Indian people, so that they transferred their hatred of colonial rule and exploitation to sectarian bloodshed and infighting. Not a few Indians died under this trick.

Nehru was very resentful of this divisive policy: "I cannot forgive or condone the British authorities' deliberate creation of divisions in India. All other injuries will become a thing of the past, but this division will cause us to continue to suffer disasters for a much longer time." (pp. 699-700)

Colonialism is the Root of Calamity

The great Indian poet and thinker Tagore said on his deathbed: "...One day the British will be forced to abandon their Indian empire. But what kind of India will they leave behind? What terrible suffering? After the river of their administration for more than a hundred years has finally dried up, what kind of rotten mud and filthy wilderness will they leave behind!"

Nehru said: "Almost all of our important problems today occurred during the British rule, and are also a direct consequence of British policies: the princely state issue; the minority issue; the various privileged classes of foreigners and Indians; the lack of industry and the neglect of agriculture; the extreme backwardness of social services; and most importantly, the deplorable poverty of the people..." (p. 398)

What else is there besides harm from British colonialism to India! The people of China and India have both tasted the pain bestowed by colonialism and deeply understand that: Colonialism is the root of calamity!

    英国对印度的“恩惠”
    ——读尼赫鲁总理“印度的发现”札记——
    龙章
    12月9日周恩来总理访问印度时，在加尔各答举行的记者招待会上，英国广播公司的记者问：“总理在目前访问印度以后，是否认为英国对印度的坏处比好处大，如果是这样的话，那是怎么回事呢？”周总理笑着说：“这个问题应该由印度朋友来答复。但是我能够告诉你们关于殖民主义在中国遗留下来的罪恶的情况。……”
    报纸上刊载这项消息的时候，我正在阅读贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁的“印度的发现”。从这本书里，我找到了对这一问题的解答。
    经济的贫困和落后
    从十七世纪初期东印度公司获得莫卧儿大帝的允许在苏拉特创办工厂起，一直到1947年印度独立时止，英国在印度压榨、统治了三百多年。
    英国殖民主义在印度的掠夺，帮助了它的工业革命。尼赫鲁说：“西欧转变到工业主义的大部分代价，都是由经济被欧洲列强所统治着的印度、中国和其他的殖民地国家所代付了的。”（“印度的发现”三九○页，下同）这种掠夺是极其残酷的。英国的历史学家爱德华·汤姆逊说道：“人们记得英国人所统治印度的初期历史，那大概是世界上非法榨取的最高记录了。”虽然印度做了英国工业的乳母，但是英国却摧毁了印度的手工业和农业。
    英国的入侵，使得印度的手工业破产，造成了大规模的失业和死亡。英国的印度总督本丁克在1834年报告中说道：“怨惨境况在商业史上是无与伦比的。棉织工人的白骨使印度平原都白成一片了。”英国殖民主义使得一向是印度经济基础的农村公社瓦解了，丧失了它在经济上和行政上的作用。为了更残酷地压榨农民，英国殖民主义制造出一个与它利害一致的阶级——地主阶级。1793年印度总督柯努奥利斯颁布了“永久佃租制”的法令。这制度被本丁克赞扬道：“它已经制造了一个庞大的富有的地主集团——他们都是深切地关心着英国统治的持续，以便于他们对人民大众的彻底控制。”英国殖民主义严重地破坏了印度的经济和生活，“使得印度农民成为地球上最贫苦最可怜的人物之一。”（三九一页）
    尼赫鲁说：“显然印度一直都拥有着发展工业所需要的丰富资源——管理和技术才能、熟练工人，甚至还有一些资金，尽管这些资金继续不断的从印度外流出去。”（三九○页）他还举出第一次世界大战时期英国货物的输入受到阻碍的时候，印度工业曾获得发展的事实来证明这点。尽管是这样，但是英国殖民主义者却千方百计地限制印度工业的发展：“英国人认为印刷机、并且实在是认为一切的机器，对于印度的思想都是含有危险性而且含有爆炸性的，无论如何决不可予以鼓励，惟恐引起叛乱的传播和工业的发展。有一个故事说，海得拉巴的君主曾经一度表示想要看一看欧洲的机器。于是英国驻扎官就为他买了一架排气唧筒和一架印刷机。君主的暂时好奇心既已得到满足之后，这些机器就和其他的礼物以及珍品一并收藏起来了。但是当在加尔各答的政府听说这事之后，他们对驻扎官表示不满，并特别谴责他，因为他把印刷机介绍到一个印度土邦里去了。这位驻扎官提议如果政府愿意的话，他就暗中去把机器毁掉。”（四○八页）
    在印度，工业的发展被阻碍了一百年之久。许多产品都不准许在印度制造。例如：在第一次大战时，火车的机车、客车和货车都很缺乏，印度的塔塔钢铁公司决定制造机车，曾从国外输入了机器。但当战争结束的时候，英国又决定继续购买英国制的机车。印度许多糖厂的副产品——糖蜜是被当作废料的，只要经过简单的加工就可制成强力酒精。但是因为这项生产会影响英国的缅甸石油公司的利益，所以不允许这样做。直到第二次大战的第三年缅甸陷落、石油和汽油的供应被截断之后，并在美国的格拉第考察团的建议下，才认识到必须在印度生产。过去，大量的药品和痘苗都是由外国输入的，战争使它停顿了。有人提议比较重要的药品和痘苗可以在印度制造。连这项与印度人民的健康和生命攸关的倡议都被拒绝了。至于造船、飞机、汽车等工业更受到严格的限制。
    沉重的负担
    印度人民在英国殖民主义统治时期的负担是非常沉重的。“印度必须负担征服自己的经费，负担把自己由东印度公司移交（或出卖）给英皇的经费，负担将大英帝国扩张到缅甸和其他地方去的经费，负担派遣远征军到非洲、波斯等地的军费，最后还负担英国人防制印度人自己的经费。印度不仅仅被当作大英帝国根据地来使用，不给任何报酬，而且它还不得不进一步为了一部分英国陆军在本国的训练而付出费用——这些费用就是那所谓的分摊费。的确，英国还要印度拿出英国所支付的各项费用，例如英国在中国和波斯的外交与领事机关的维持费，从英国到印度电报线路的全部开支，英国地中海舰队的部分经费，甚至伦敦招待土耳其苏丹的费用。”（三九七页）
    被温斯顿·丘吉尔誉为“英王皇冠上那颗最为光亮而珍贵的宝石”——印度，不仅在经济上遭受英国殖民主义掠夺，还要负担这么多项目的费用、苛捐杂税和巨额的罚金。多少年来，英国殖民主义从印度掠夺的财富是无法估计的。但是，仅在第二次大战的时候，“印度在五年之中所担负的实际战争费用大大地超过了英国一百多年来在印度投资的总和。”（六六八页）至于英国殖民主义带给印度人民的
  “好处”是什么呢：“印度众多人民的饥饿、灾荒、流行病、萎弱、抵抗力减低、发育不全和死于饥饿和疾病。”（六六八页）
    饥馑、屠杀、镇压
    英国殖民主义掠夺印度的初期，造成了1766年至1770年的大饥荒，饿死了孟加拉和比哈尔的三分之一以上的居民。1943至1944年孟加拉的饥荒又饿死了三百四十万人，同时发觉在这期间有46％的孟加拉居民遭受过严重疾病的痛苦。——英国官方调查团于1945年公布的最低的数字是一百五十万人直接死于这次饥荒。
    印度人民不能忍受殖民主义的剥削统治，先后爆发了多少次起义和抗英运动，但都被英国殖民主义用残无人道的屠杀、逮捕镇压下去了。仅就1857年的大规模起义来说，被屠杀的人数是没法计算的，尼赫鲁说：“帖木儿〔注一〕和纳迭尔沙〔注二〕的那些日子还在人们记忆之中，但由于英国人的范围广大而历时悠久的新恐怖使得他们的丰功伟业黯淡无光了。官方允许进行一个星期的劫掠。但是实际劫掠继续了一个月，而且是和大规模的屠杀一道进行的。”（四二五页）英国殖民主义者为了镇压印度人民的反抗，经常进行大规模的逮捕。仅在1940到1941年间，就有民族主义运动的领导人三万人被捕入狱。千千万万的人因为作讲演或其他活动被捕监禁。1942年8月9日在印度全国实施大规模的逮捕，引起全国的不满，群众示威，抵制英货、罢市、罢工，抗议这一逮捕。英国出动军警枪击群众，还用飞机低飞扫射。英国官方发表：军警除时常从流动的军用卡车开枪射击以外，至少向群众枪击过五百三十八次；民众被军警枪杀一千零二十八人，伤三千二百人。——正如九龙骚乱后一样，英国官方总是要低估实际死伤数字的。在这次动乱之后，特别法庭判决几千人长期监禁，很多人被判处死刑。在农村里，有些整个乡村被定罪，从鞭挞直到死刑，整个的乡村被科罚九百万卢比的罚金。
    分裂、挑拨、离间
    为了削弱民族主义运动，以利于英国殖民主义的统治，英国对印度施行分裂、挑拨、离间的政策。六百零一个土邦散布在全国各地。大多数的土邦连半独立的经济状态都不能维持，一切有计划的经济上和文化上的进步都很困难，只有依附英国殖民主义才能使它们苟活下去。英国提倡倾轧不和，鼓励一个集团反对另一个集团，鼓励因宗教或省区而引起的分裂倾向，鼓励效忠于种族和教派的口号和行动。
    我们可以从印度进步作家穆克·拉吉·安纳德的小说“贱民”里看到英国殖民主义蓄意保留印度种姓制度所造成的怨惨情况。安纳德的另一部小说“苦力”又揭示出英国殖民主义在统治印度时所造成的教派间的冲突流血情况。用这种伎俩来迷惑印度人民，使他们把对殖民主义统治盘剥的仇恨转移到教派间的流血与倾轧。在这种诡计下丧命的印度人是不算少的。
    尼赫鲁对这种分裂政策是非常痛恨的：“我不能原谅或宽恕英国当局在印度有意的制造分裂。其他一切的伤害都会成为过去，惟独这分裂将要使我们继续遭受灾害的时间更长久得多。”（六九九—七○○页）
    殖民主义是祸患的根源
    印度伟大的诗人和思想家泰戈尔临终时说：“……总有一天会强迫英国人放弃他们的印度帝国。但是他们所遗留下来的印度将是怎样一个印度呢？是怎样厉害的苦难呢？当他们百余年来施政的河流终于干涸了之后，他们所遗留下来的将是怎样的烂泥和污秽的荒野！”
    尼赫鲁说：“几乎所有我们今天的重要问题都是在英国统治时代发生的，而且也是英国政策的直接后果：王公问题；少数派问题；外国人和印度人的各种特权阶级问题；工业的缺乏和农业的遭受忽视；社会服务事业的极端落后；最重要的是，人民的可悲的贫穷问题。……”（三九八页）
    英国殖民主义对印度除了坏处之外还有什么呢！中印两国人民都尝受过殖民主义所赋予的痛苦，深刻地体会到：殖民主义是祸患的根源！
    〔注一〕帖木儿（1336—1405）蒙古族王。十四世纪后期，帖木儿曾入侵印度的德里和旁遮普的若干地方，使德里变成一个死人的城市。
    〔注二〕纳迭尔沙（1688—1747）波斯王。1739年侵入德里，杀戮抢掠，运走了大量的珍宝，包括有名的孔雀宝座在内。
