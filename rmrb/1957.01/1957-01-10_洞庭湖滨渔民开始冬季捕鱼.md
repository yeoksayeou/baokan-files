Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 8th. Fishermen on Dongting Lake have begun their winter fishing season. In recent days, white sails have dotted the lake surface, and at night, fishing lights twinkle. At the sound of the signal gun announcing the start of the fishing season, hundreds of fishing boats gathered at the center of the lake, vying to cast their nets. The nine fishing cooperatives in Yuanjiang County, which started fishing earlier, with approximately 1,400 people, have already caught more than 296,000 catties of fresh fish within a month.

Local aquatic product supply and marketing companies have established purchasing stations in major fish-producing areas. Some places also have mobile purchasing boats that collect fish as soon as they are caught.

    洞庭湖滨渔民开始冬季捕鱼
    新华社长沙8日电　洞庭湖滨渔民开始冬季捕鱼。这些天来，湖面上白帆点点，入夜渔火闪烁。一声开湖讯号枪响，成百上千的渔船就麕集湖心，争先撒网。开湖较早的沅江县九个渔业社约一千四百多人，一个月内已经捕获鲜鱼二十九万六千多斤。
    各地水产供销公司已经在各主要鱼产区设立了收购站。有的地方还设有流动收购船随捕随收。
