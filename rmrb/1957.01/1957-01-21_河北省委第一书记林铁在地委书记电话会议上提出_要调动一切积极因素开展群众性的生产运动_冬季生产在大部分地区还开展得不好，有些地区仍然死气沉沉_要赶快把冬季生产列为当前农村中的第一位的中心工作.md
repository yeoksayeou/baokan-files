Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 20th – The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a telephone conference of local prefectural committee secretaries on the 16th, requiring all parts of the province to quickly launch a large-scale yet practical mass winter production campaign.

Lin Tie, First Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke about the winter production situation in the province at the telephone conference, saying: Currently, the province's winter production has achieved certain results. However, winter production in most areas is not developing well, and some areas even remain stagnant. Lin Tie pointed out: "The Beginning of Spring" is approaching, and all localities should list winter production as the most prominent and primary central task in current rural work, with all other work revolving around winter production.

In order to launch a mass winter production movement quickly and well, Lin Tie pointed out: Not only is it necessary to propose various necessary plans and indicators from top to bottom, but more importantly, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to formulate active and reliable plans and indicators from bottom to top with reference to the national plan and based on current conditions, as the goals and aspirations for the broad masses of commune members. To this end, Lin Tie put forward several requirements for localities to study and implement according to specific circumstances:

In terms of formulating plans, winter production plans should be closely integrated with annual production plans, and comprehensive arrangements should be made for agricultural production and diversified economic activities. The production increase targets of agricultural cooperatives must conform to the principles of adapting to local conditions, being proactive and reliable, and should generally be controlled at a level higher than the normal yield, but which production teams can exceed through effort. In terms of accumulating fertilizer, it is still necessary to vigorously tap fertilizer sources, launch mass movements to raise pigs and livestock to accumulate fertilizer, increase the quantity of fertilizer accumulation, and improve the quality of fertilizer accumulation. In terms of farmland water conservancy, for wells, the focus should be on consolidating and fully utilizing the effectiveness of existing wells. Areas where well-digging yielded practical benefits last year should actively develop according to their capabilities, such as shallow wells with deep cones, old well reconstruction and repair, and installation of water lifting tools. Where conditions permit, new wells should still be drilled with cones. Areas that did not receive practical benefits last year but genuinely need wells can repair old wells to exert the effectiveness of existing wells according to their capabilities. Channels washed away by water should be repaired in a timely manner. Soil and water conservation in mountainous areas should be actively carried out in accordance with the principle of "unified planning and comprehensive development." Small reservoirs can be built according to capacity. Ditches and ridge fields should be repaired according to the principle of "taking into account storage ponds and taking into account upstream and downstream." Agricultural cooperatives should also fully study and discuss the aspects of protecting livestock, preparing for farming, developing sideline production, and developing diversified economic activities, and formulate active and reliable plans and indicators based on their strength.

Lin Tie then pointed out: Localities should summarize the experience of running cooperatives over the past year and launch a broad and in-depth political propaganda campaign around the Spring Festival, educating the masses to correctly understand the superiority of advanced cooperatives, affirming the achievements of the past year, protecting the enthusiasm of cadres, and inspiring the production enthusiasm of the masses, thereby mobilizing all positive factors and launching a large-scale production movement. Lin Tie also pointed out: Launching a mass winter production movement requires certain forms and momentum, but formalism must be opposed. Production competitions can be launched between teams within a commune, or competitions can be launched between communes based on the communes themselves, with the township as the unit. It is also possible to organize visits, exchange experiences, and award models. However, do not convene mass meetings that are too large in scale, too long in duration, or too frequent, so as not to delay production and fall into formalism.

Lin Tie also pointed out: The work of rectifying the cooperatives and the Party must be carried out in the process of launching the production movement, and it must also serve production. In the rectification of the cooperatives, the scale of the cooperatives and teams should be quickly determined, the cultivated areas should be divided, and this year's production plan should be formulated so that the mood of the commune members can be stabilized and they can actively prepare for spring plowing production. It is also necessary to seize the time to complete the profit distribution settlement. In the rectification of the cooperatives, the policy of mutual benefit should be conscientiously implemented to strengthen the unity of middle and poor peasant commune members. Any phenomenon of not daring to publicize to commune members or not willing to implement the policy of mutual benefit must be corrected. Lin Tie finally pointed out: In the rectification of the cooperatives, it is necessary to rely on Party members, League members, activists, poor peasants and lower-middle peasants to consolidate the cooperatives; rely on positive forces to run the cooperatives well.

    河北省委第一书记林铁在地委书记电话会议上提出
    要调动一切积极因素开展群众性的生产运动
    冬季生产在大部分地区还开展得不好，有些地区仍然死气沉沉
    要赶快把冬季生产列为当前农村中的第一位的中心工作
    新华社保定20日电　中共河北省委员会在16日召开各地委书记电话会议，要求全省各地目前应该迅速开展一个声势浩大的而又切合实际的群众性的冬季生产运动。
    中共河北省委第一书记林铁在电话会议上谈到这个省的冬季生产情况时说：目前，全省冬季生产已经取得一定成绩。但是，大部分地区还开展得不好，甚至有些地区仍然死气沉沉。林铁指出：“立春”时节快要到来，各地应该把冬季生产列为当前农村工作中的最突出的第一位的中心工作，其他一切工作都要围绕冬季生产进行。
    为了又快又好地开展一个群众性的冬季生产运动，林铁指出：不仅需要自上而下地提出各项必要的计划和指标，更重要的是要发动群众自下而上地参照国家计划，根据当前条件，制定出积极可靠的各项计划和指标，作为广大社员群众行动的目标和奔头。为此，林铁提出了几点要求，要各地按照具体情况研究实行：
    在制定计划方面，要把冬季生产计划和全年的生产计划紧密结合起来，要把农业生产和多种经济作全面的安排。农业社的增产指标，一定要符合因地制宜、积极可靠的原则，一般可控制在高于常年产量，又使生产队经过努力能够超过的限度为宜。在积肥方面，仍应提出大力挖掘肥源，开展群众性的养猪养畜积肥运动，增加积肥数量，提高积肥质量。在农田水利方面，对于水井，要以巩固与充分发挥现有水井的效能为主。凡是去年打井收到实际效益的地区，都要积极地量力发展，如浅井深锥，旧井改建修复，安装提水工具等，有条件的仍应锥打新井；去年没有收到实际效益，而又确实需要水井的地区，可以量力修整旧井以发挥现有水井的效能。被水冲毁的渠道，要适时修复。山区的水土保持，应根据“统一规划、综合开发”的原则，积极进行。小型水库，可量力举办。沟洫畦田，应本“蓄池兼顾、上下游兼顾”的方针进行修做。保畜、备耕、开展副业生产、发展多种经济等方面，农业社也要充分研究讨论，根据力量，定出积极可靠的计划和指标。
    林铁接着指出：各地要通过总结一年来的办社经验，在春节前后，开展一个广泛深入的政治宣传运动，教育群众正确认识高级社的优越性，肯定一年来的成绩，保护干部热情，鼓舞群众的生产积极性，从而调动起一切积极因素，掀起一个声势浩大的生产运动。林铁还指出：开展一个群众性的冬季生产运动，需要一定的形式和声势，但要反对形式主义。可以社为单位，发动队与队之间的生产竞赛，也可以乡为单位，以社为基础，发动社与社之间互相竞赛，还可组织参观、交流经验和评奖模范。但不要召开规模过大、时间过长、次数过多的群众大会，以免耽误生产，流于形式。
    林铁还指出：整社整党工作一定要在发动生产运动的过程中进行，还必须服务于生产。在整社中，应该迅速确定社和队的规模，划分好耕作区，制定出今年的生产计划，使社员的心情稳定下来，积极为春耕生产作准备。并要抓紧时间把收益分配决算进行完毕。整社中要认真贯彻执行互利政策，以加强中、贫农社员的团结。任何不敢向社员宣传和不愿执行互利政策的现象，必须纠正。林铁最后指出：在整社中要依靠党员、团员，依靠积极分子，依靠贫农和下中农，把社巩固好；依靠积极力量把社办好。
