How the Lijiazhai Market Leads Farmers' Trade
Zhai Jianguo

Lijiazhai is a medium-sized market town in the southern mountainous area of Henan Province, conveniently located along the Beijing-Hankou Railway. The economic zone surrounding the market town includes over 5,000 farming households, producing more than 300 kinds of local and sideline products. The income from farmers' sales of local and sideline products accounts for over 60% of their total income. For many years, merchants dealing in local products from as far south as Hankou, north to Tianjin, and west to Xi'an have come here to purchase goods. However, in a period not long ago, the market conditions here were not as active as in the past.

After the opening of free markets, the sluggish situation of the Lijiazhai market began to be broken. However, in the early stages of opening up, because the cadres did not have a deep understanding of the policies, lacked experience in managing free markets, and were afraid of making mistakes and dared not manage, chaotic situations once appeared in the market, especially the chaotic situation of farmer trade. Some farmers abandoned agriculture to engage in commerce; some even went to other provinces to traffic goods back and sell them at high prices in the market; some casually sold unified purchase and sales materials and the public property of agricultural cooperatives; some agricultural cooperatives wanted to abolish the contracts originally signed with supply and marketing cooperatives and were unwilling to sell goods to supply and marketing cooperatives.

After the market management organization of Lijiazhai discovered the chaotic situation of farmer trade, in addition to strengthening policy education for cadres, it also took a series of measures to strengthen the leadership of farmer trade.

After the market management organization clearly defined the scope of farmer trade, it conducted propaganda and education for the farmers. They also used specific examples and detailed calculations to persuade farmers not to blindly engage in commercial activities. Once, four members of the Sanhe Township Agricultural Cooperative went to Xiaogan County, Hubei Province to traffic vermicelli; later, because vermicelli was banned from leaving the province, they trafficked a batch of shoe-upper edge strips back, resulting in a loss of forty-eight yuan, including travel expenses and food costs. They used this example to explain to the farmers that blindly engaging in commercial activities often leads to great losses; if these four farmers had not made this trip and had worked diligently in agriculture at home, not only would they not have lost money, but each of them could have earned many work points. After listening to this, many farmers said that they would not blindly engage in business in the future.

Studying market changes at any time and adjusting unreasonable market prices in a timely manner is also one of the important measures to guide farmer trade. For example, the amount of charcoal purchased by the supply and marketing cooperative in mid-November last year (charcoal accounts for more than half of the small local products in Lijiazhai) decreased by 55% compared with the first ten days of the month. The reason was that the agricultural cooperative wanted to transport charcoal to Kaifeng for sale and was unwilling to sell it to the supply and marketing cooperative. The market management organization studied the situation and found that the charcoal purchase price of the local supply and marketing cooperative was lower than the price in the Kaifeng area; at the same time, some farmers were busy transporting charcoal to the station, which not only affected agricultural production but also made transportation unnecessarily busy. For this reason, the purchase price of charcoal was increased from 3.4 fen per catty to 3.6 fen. At the same time as the price increase, they also used detailed calculations to explain to the farmers that although there was still a certain price difference between the purchase price in Lijiazhai (after the price increase) and the price in the Kaifeng area, if the transportation costs, losses, travel expenses, etc. en route were deducted, they would be basically the same. As a result, farmers brought charcoal back from the station and sold it to the supply and marketing cooperative. In the last five days of late November, the supply and marketing cooperative collected 170,000 catties of charcoal, more than double the amount purchased in mid-November. The supply and marketing cooperative completed the purchase task, and the sideline production of the agricultural cooperative was also brought back on track.

The market management organization attached importance to the establishment of farmer trading agencies. After the establishment of farmer trading agencies, most of the farmer trade was linked to market commercial activities, reducing the randomness of farmer trade. The prices of chickens, ducks, eggs, etc. traded through the trading agencies have never fluctuated. The trading agencies not only facilitated farmer trade but also helped the agricultural cooperative better plan sideline production.

In order to lead farmer trade, supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives widely entered into contracts. After the supply and marketing cooperative understood the labor force, land area, and product situation of the agricultural cooperative, it helped the agricultural cooperative plan sideline production according to the technical conditions and production habits of each agricultural cooperative. The supply and marketing cooperative also helped the agricultural cooperative adjust sideline raw materials and exchange technical experience in sideline production. Then, the supply and marketing cooperative signed a contract with the agricultural cooperative. In this way, the agricultural cooperative can avoid the blindness of production, the supply and marketing cooperative has a source of goods, and farmer trade is also brought back on track. The head of the Dawang Township Agricultural Cooperative said: "After signing the contract, the members have work to do, the products have buyers, and they are spared from unnecessary troubles."

In the past, the market management of Lijiazhai was mainly the responsibility of the supply and marketing cooperative. The sign of the market management committee was hung in front of the supply and marketing cooperative. The farmers felt that "everything is managed by the supply and marketing cooperative" and were very dissatisfied, so they confronted the market management committee. After the market was opened, the management committee was reorganized, and the management committee was jointly composed of units such as the supply and marketing cooperative, the tax bureau, the bank, and the grain department, which were responsible for their respective tasks under the leadership of the township head. In order to listen to the opinions of farmers, representatives of agricultural cooperatives were also absorbed to participate in market management. Problems that occurred in the market were resolved through joint consultation. In this way, the market was easier to manage. Some farmers who wanted to set up stalls to do business returned to engage in agricultural production after being persuaded by representatives of agricultural cooperatives participating in market management.

At present, the farmer trade situation in Lijiazhai is basically normal. Farmers who abandoned agriculture to engage in commerce have returned to the agricultural cooperative to participate in production. Agricultural cooperatives are carrying out various sideline production activities. Members of the Dawang Township Agricultural Cooperative raised more than 40 more pigs in a few days and also resumed the sideline production of bamboo weaving. From March to the autumn harvest pre-distribution last year, the total sideline income of the 222 households in this cooperative was only more than 400 yuan; while in October and November last year, the monthly income was 3,700 yuan. The market has also gradually prospered.

    李家寨市场怎样领导农民贸易
    翟建国
    李家寨，是河南省南部山区的一个中等集镇，位于京汉铁路沿线，交通便利。集镇周围的经济区，有五千多户农民，出产三百多种土产和副产品。农民出售土副产品的收入，占整个收入的60％以上。多年以来，南达汉口、北到天津、西至西安一带的土产商人，往往到这里来采办货物。但是，不久以前的一个时期，这里的市场情况却没有过去活跃了。
    开放自由市场以后，李家寨市场的沉滞局面开始被打破。但是，在开放的初期，因为干部对政策领会得不深，缺乏管理自由市场的经验，又怕犯错误而不敢管，市场上一度出现混乱情况，农民贸易的混乱情况尤为严重。有的农民弃农经商；有的甚至到外省去贩运货物回来在市场上高价出售；有的随便出卖统购统销的物资和农业社的公共财产；有的农业社要废除原先同供销社订立的合同，不愿卖东西给供销社。
    李家寨的市场管理机构，发现农民贸易混乱的情况以后，除了对干部加强政策教育以外，还采取了一系列的措施，加强了对农民贸易的领导。
    市场管理机构明确规定了农民贸易的范围以后，便向农民进行宣传教育。他们还通过具体事例、算细账等方法，劝导农民不要盲目从事商业活动。有一次，三河乡农业社有四个社员到湖北孝感县贩买粉条；后来因粉条禁止出境，贩运了一批鞋帮缘条回来，结果，连车费、伙食费在内赔了四十八元。他们便用这个例子向农民说明：盲目从事商业活动，往往会招致很大的损失；这四个农民如果不做这一趟生意，在家好好务农，不仅不会赔钱，每人还可得到不少工分。许多农民听了以后，都表示以后不盲目经营商业了。
    随时研究市场的变化，及时地调整不合理的市场价格，也是领导农民贸易重要的措施之一。例如，供销社在去年11月中旬收购的木炭 （木炭占李家寨小土产的一半以上），比上旬减少了55％。原因是农业社要把木炭运到开封去出售，不愿卖给供销社。市场管理机构研究了情况，发现当地供销社的木炭收购价比开封地区的价格低；同时，一些农民忙于运送木炭到车站去，不仅影响农业生产，也使运输徒增繁忙。为此，便把木炭的收购价由每斤三分四厘提高到三分六厘。在提价的同时，还用算细账的方法向农民说明：李家寨的收购价 （提价以后），和开封地区的价格虽仍有一定的差价，但如果扣除在途中的运费、损耗、旅费等，基本上是差不多的。农民于是纷纷把木炭从车站拉回来，卖给供销社。供销社在11月下旬的后五天，就收了十七万斤木炭，超过中旬收购量一倍以上。供销社完成了收购任务，农业社的副业生产也走上正规了。
    市场管理机构重视了建立农民行栈的工作。建立农民行栈以后，大部分农民贸易和市场商业活动联系起来了，减少了农民贸易的散漫性。经过行栈交易的鸡、鸭、蛋等的价格，都没有发生过波动。行栈不仅便利了农民贸易，也帮助了农业社更好地规划副业生产。
    为了领导农民贸易，供销社和农业社广泛地订立了合同。供销社了解了农业社的劳动力、地亩、物产等情况以后，便按每个农业社的技术条件、生产习惯等，帮助农业社规划副业生产。供销社还帮助农业社互相调剂副业原料，交流副业生产的技术经验。然后，供销社就同农业社签订合同。这样，农业社可以避免生产的盲目性，供销社的货源也有了着落，农民贸易也走上正规了。大王乡农业社社长说：“订了合同，社员有活干，产品有人买，又免得乱折腾。”
    李家寨的市场管理，过去主要是由供销合作社负责的。市场管理委员会的牌子，就挂在供销社的门前。农民认为“什么都由供销社管”，很不满意，就同市场管理委员会闹对立。市场开放以后，改组了管理委员会，由供销社、税局、银行、粮食部门等单位共同组成管理委员会，在乡长领导下，分工负责。为了听取农民的意见，还吸收农业社的代表参加市场管理。市场上发生的问题，由大家共同协商解决。这样，市场就容易管理了。有些农民要摆摊做买卖，经参加市场管理的农业社代表劝说后，就都收摊回去从事农业生产了。
    目前，李家寨的农民贸易情况基本上是正常的。弃农经商的农民，都回到农业社里参加生产去了。农业社正在开展多种副业生产。大王乡农业社社员，在几天里就多喂了四十多头猪，也恢复了编竹器的副业生产。从去年3月到秋收预分，这个社的二百二十二户农民，副业收入总共只有四百多元；而在去年10月到11月，每个月就收入了三千七百元。市场也逐渐地繁盛起来了。
