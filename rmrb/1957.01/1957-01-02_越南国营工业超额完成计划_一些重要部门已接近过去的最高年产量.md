Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 1st: The Vietnamese newspaper "People's Daily" published an editorial yesterday stating that, to date, the state-owned industrial sector has overfulfilled the 1956 industrial production plan in terms of gross output value, with the 1956 gross output value increasing fourfold compared to 1955. Some important sectors, such as coal, cement, cotton yarn, and cloth, have reached 75% to 80% of their highest output levels during the former French rule. In terms of capital construction, more than ten units have been completed, some of which have already begun production; others are nearing completion.

The "People's Daily" then contrasted this with the fact that only a few dozen factories were built throughout the entire period of French colonial rule in Vietnam, illustrating the significant achievements made by the Vietnamese people in economic construction.

The newspaper pointed out that Vietnam's ability to increase industrial output to near its past peak despite difficult circumstances demonstrates the Party's economic management capabilities, as well as the immense creativity of the Vietnamese working class and people.

The editorial mentioned the important role played by the experts from fraternal countries, especially the Soviet Union and China, in realizing the 1956 industrial production plan, and stated that in 1957, the assistance of fraternal countries must be well utilized, and efforts must be made to learn from the experts of fraternal countries.

The "People's Daily" concluded by saying that in realizing the 1957 industrial production plan, it is necessary to implement the Party Central Committee and the government's line of economic recovery, and it is essential to attach great importance to the development of light industry and handicrafts production in order to supply the people with necessities.

    越南国营工业超额完成计划
    一些重要部门已接近过去的最高年产量
    新华社河内1日电　越南“人民报”昨天发表社论说，到目前为止，国营工业部门在总产值方面已经超额完成了1956年工业生产计划，1956年的总产值比1955年增加四倍。一些重要部门，如煤炭、水泥、棉纱和布匹等，都达到以前法国统治时期最高产量的75％到80％。在基本建设方面已经完成了十多个单位，有的单位已经投入生产；还有一些单位即将建成。
      “人民报”接着用以前法国殖民者统治越南的整个时期只建成了几十个工厂来对比，说明了越南人民在经济建设方面所取得的具有重大意义的成就。
    这家报纸指出，越南在困难的情况下能够把工业产量增加到接近过去的最高年产量，证明了党的经济管理能力，同时也证明了越南工人阶级和人民的巨大创造力。
    社论谈到各兄弟国家、尤其是苏联和中国的专家对越南的帮助在实现1956年工业生产计划中起的重要作用，并且说，在1957年必须很好地利用兄弟国家的援助，并且努力向兄弟国家的专家学习。
    “人民报”最后说，在实现1957年工业生产计划中，必须贯彻党中央和政府的恢复经济的路线，并且必须十分重视发展轻工业和手工业的生产，以便供应人民以必需品。
