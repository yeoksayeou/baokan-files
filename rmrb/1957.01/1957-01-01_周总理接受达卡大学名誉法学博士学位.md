Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, 30th—Premier Zhou Enlai received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Dhaka University on the 29th, wearing a red academic gown.

    The ceremony was held in the brightly lit "Curzon Hall" of Dhaka University. Fazlul Haq, Chancellor of Dhaka University and Governor of East Pakistan, presented the certificate to Premier Zhou Enlai. A total of 800 guests and faculty members of Dhaka University attended the ceremony. Prime Minister Suhrawardy also attended the ceremony.
    In his citation for the conferment of the degree, Dhaka University Vice-Chancellor Ibrahim praised Zhou Enlai as "one of the most influential figures of our time." He said that the leadership activities carried out by Zhou Enlai had played a role in transforming the history of his people. The citation also enumerated Zhou Enlai's contributions to China's economic, cultural, and spiritual development, a development that "would normally have taken decades."
    Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech at the ceremony. He said that the awarding of the honorary degree was not only an honor for him personally, but also an honor for the Chinese people.
    He said that for a long time, colonialism had been hindering and obstructing the development of science and technology in China and Pakistan. Only after achieving political independence through arduous struggles could the culture and education of the two countries be independently developed.
    He said that the Chinese people believe that every country and nation in the world has its own advantages worth learning from by other countries. As the friendly relations between Pakistan and China have developed anew, favorable conditions have been created, and the cooperation between the intellectual circles of the two countries has a bright future.
    In the evening, from the Government House to Dhaka University, Dhaka was enveloped in a festive atmosphere. As the Chinese guests drove through the streets, there were endless colored lights, arches, and buildings decorated with glittering lights. Crowds lined the streets to welcome them, chanting "Pak-Chini bhai bhai" (Pakistani and Chinese people are brothers).

    周总理接受达卡大学名誉法学博士学位
    新华社达卡30日电　周恩来总理在29日穿着红色礼袍接受了达卡大学名誉法学博士的学位。
    在灯火辉煌的达卡大学“克尔曾大厅”里举行了典礼。达卡大学校长、东巴基斯坦省长法兹鲁尔·哈克把证书授给了周恩来总理。参加典礼的共有来宾和达卡大学教职员八百人。苏拉瓦底总理也参加了典礼。
    达卡大学副校长易卜拉欣在宣读授予学位的介绍词中称赞周恩来是“我们这个时代的有数的有影响的人物之一”。他说，周恩来所进行的领导活动在转变他的人民的历史方面发挥了作用。介绍词还历述了周恩来在中国的经济、文化和精神发展中所作出的贡献，这种发展
  “按照通常的标准本来是需要几十年的时间的”。
    周恩来总理在典礼上致词。他说，授予名誉学位，不仅是他个人的光荣，也是中国人民的光荣。
    他说，长时期以来，殖民主义一直在妨碍和阻挠着中国和巴基斯坦的科学和技术的发展。在经过艰苦的斗争取得了政治独立以后，两国的文化和教育才有可能获得独立的发展。
    他说，中国人民认为，全世界每一个国家和民族都有自己的优点，值得其他国家学习。由于巴基斯坦和中国之间的友好关系有了新的发展，就产生了有利的条件，两国知识界的合作也就有了光明的前途。
    晚上，从政府大厦到达卡大学，一路上可以看到达卡笼罩在一片节日气氛中。中国客人们乘汽车通过市街，一路上是看不到头的彩色电灯、拱门和装饰着晶莹的电灯的楼房。熙熙攘攘的人群夹道欢迎，并且高呼“巴克—秦尼巴依巴依”（巴中人民是兄弟）。
