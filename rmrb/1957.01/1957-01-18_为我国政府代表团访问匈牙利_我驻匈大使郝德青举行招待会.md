Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 17th. Chinese Ambassador to Hungary, Hao Deqing, held a reception on the evening of the 16th at 8 p.m. to celebrate the visit of the Chinese government delegation led by Premier Zhou Enlai to Hungary.

Among those present at the reception were Hungarian party and state leaders Dobi, Kádár, Münnich, Marosán, and others. Also present were heads of various Hungarian government departments and diplomatic envoys, totaling over two hundred people.

The reception took place in a friendly and warm atmosphere.

Premier Zhou Enlai said in his speech at the reception that the purpose of the Chinese government delegation's visit to Budapest was to express full sympathy for the heroic Hungarian people and their struggle to safeguard the socialist system, and to express full support for the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, which led this struggle to victory. Although we are in Budapest for only a short period of less than a day, we have met with leading comrades from the Hungarian party and government, and with party activists. In our contacts, it can be seen that the Hungarian people, under the leadership of the party and government, have full confidence in safeguarding the socialist system, stabilizing socialist order, and ensuring that Hungary is a brave and strong member of our socialist camp. This is something worth admiring and celebrating.

Premier Zhou Enlai then raised his glass to congratulate the health of the Hungarian party and government leaders. Premier Kádár spoke at the banquet. He said that the Chinese delegation's acceptance of the Hungarian government's invitation to come to Budapest was an expression of sympathy and support for the Hungarian people's struggle, and a sign of solidarity with the Hungarian people. He said that Premier Zhou Enlai, in his speech at the activists' meeting, mentioned that 600 million Chinese people will always be with the Hungarian people, and 600 million Chinese people represent a huge force. Kádár said that he had visited China last year, which made him further understand the Chinese people. The Chinese people are very good, with a great and long-standing cultural tradition, hardworking and talented, and especially admirable is their ability to be very disciplined. Finally, Premier Kádár proposed a toast to Premier Zhou Enlai and other members of the delegation, to Ambassador Hao Deqing, and to the happiness and health of 600 million Chinese people.
