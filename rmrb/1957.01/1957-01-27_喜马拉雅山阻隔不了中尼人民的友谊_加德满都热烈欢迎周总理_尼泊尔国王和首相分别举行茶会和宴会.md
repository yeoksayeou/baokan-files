Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, January 26th. Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice-Premier He Long, and their entourage arrived in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, at 12:45 PM on the 25th. As their plane landed in the green Kathmandu Valley, they received a warm and grand welcome from Prime Minister Acharya and the crowds waiting at the airport.

    People welcoming them at the airport presented Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long with many garlands and a large number of flowers. Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long reviewed the guard of honor at the airport.

    As the Chinese guests stepped onto the platform set up at the airport, the thousands of men, women, and children who came to welcome them shouted welcome slogans excitedly and enthusiastically applauded.

    Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech. He said, "As Prime Minister Acharya said in Beijing three months ago, my visit here is also to bring the friendship of the people on the other side of the Himalayas to the people on this side of the Himalayas." He extended warm greetings to the government and people of the Kingdom of Nepal on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people.

    Premier Zhou Enlai reviewed the long-term development of friendship between the peoples of the two countries in history. He said that this friendship cannot be blocked even by the Himalayas and has withstood many tests. He said that now this friendship is based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference, "Therefore, we believe that the development of this friendship is part of the lofty cause of promoting world peace."

    In his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai emphasized the importance of personal contact between leaders of various countries in enhancing understanding, cooperation, and peace between countries. He said that Prime Minister Acharya's visit to China had already proved this point, and he expressed hope that "this visit to Nepal will also contribute to our common cause."

    Premier Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Prime Minister Acharya, traveled in an open-top car from the airport to the guesthouse. As the long line of cars passed through the streets of the suburbs of Kathmandu, more and more people gathered on the roadside to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai. The streets were lined with flags and banners. Crowds stood in several rows on the side of the road, on the sidewalks, on the steps, and on the walls. From the windows of every floor of the houses along the street, women and girls in festive costumes leaned out to express their welcome. Many of them scattered flowers, petals, and roasted corn to Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Acharya, and scattered cinnabar powder according to Nepalese customs. In some places, even the roofs and trees were filled with people. The streets were packed.

    Premier Zhou Enlai often put his palms together to greet the welcoming people, sometimes waving bouquets and throwing them to the welcoming crowd. Many people reached out to catch the bouquets he threw.

    For the five-mile journey from the airport to the guesthouse, the Chinese Premier and the Nepalese Prime Minister got out of the open-top car halfway and boarded a magnificent royal carriage. The carriage was drawn by four chestnut horses, two of which were ridden by knights in red. The four-wheeled carriage was led by four cavalrymen and slowly passed through the crowded streets to the cheers of the crowd. For a stretch of at least two miles, rows of long banners were hung on colored wooden poles one after another on both sides of the street. Many arches were also erected along the way, some of which had portraits of Premier Zhou Enlai. The streets were also hung with various horizontal banners written on red cloth, which wished Chairman Mao Zedong, King Mahendra, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Prime Minister Acharya a long life, and hailed the Five Principles and the solidarity of Asian countries.

    The steeds pulling the royal carriage initially walked slowly through the crowd, but then galloped quickly. By the time the Chinese Premier and the Nepalese Prime Minister arrived at the guesthouse, they were covered in cinnabar powder thrown by the welcoming crowds from head to toe.

    Marshal He Long and the Nepalese Minister of Defense rode in another royal carriage, following behind Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Acharya.

    Before leaving the airport, Zhou Enlai made a statement to dozens of Nepalese and foreign reporters. He told reporters that he was very happy to have the opportunity to visit Nepal, and he had already felt the friendship of the Nepalese people towards the Chinese people. A reporter asked about the situation in Hungary and other Eastern European countries. Zhou Enlai replied, "The situation in Hungary is becoming more and more stable, the relationship between socialist countries is improving, and their solidarity will be further strengthened."

    When asked about the situation in Afghanistan, he replied, "Afghanistan has been fighting for national independence. It has gained its independence and is now engaged in national construction. This has impressed me deeply."

    Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, January 26th. Nepalese King Mahendra received Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long at the palace at 5:00 PM on the 25th. Subsequently, the King held a tea party to entertain them.

    Prior to this, in the afternoon, Nepalese Prime Minister Acharya paid a visit to Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long. Zhou Enlai and He Long later also visited the Nepalese Prime Minister.

    At 8:00 PM, Zhou Enlai and He Long, along with their entourage, attended the banquet held by Prime Minister Acharya in the magnificent cloister hall. King Mahendra and the Queen, Nepalese military and political leaders, and diplomatic envoys from various countries attended the banquet. Zhou Enlai and He Long, together with the Nepalese King, Queen, and Prime Minister, sat on sofas in front of the King and Queen's thrones in the hall. Peaches were displayed during the banquet, and the blooming peach blossoms told people that spring had arrived.

    Before the King arrived, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long toured the hall, admiring the gilded pillars, the mythical human figures and patterns carved in wood, as well as Nepalese paintings and sculptures, and conversed with Nepalese military and political personnel, leaders of various Nepalese parties, and diplomatic envoys from various countries. During the conversation, Nepalese Foreign Minister Chuda Prasad Sharma said that the presence of Taiwan representatives in the United Nations organization was "a big joke." Zhou Enlai said, "This does not harm China, but it is detrimental to the United Nations organization." The Nepalese Foreign Minister said, "I once said in the United Nations that without Chinese representatives participating in the United Nations organization, Asian problems cannot be properly resolved."

    In the evening, the Chinese guests enjoyed song and dance performances that showcased the cultural and artistic characteristics of Nepal. In a lively folk dance called "Bhajan," the singers recounted the long-standing friendly relations between Nepal and China. The song also expressed the joy of the Nepalese people in receiving the Chinese Premier.

    The person in charge of Kathmandu Radio said that in the past three days, his radio station has specially broadcast programs about China, including speeches on China's planned economy and China's constitution. Such programs will continue for another four days, and a program introducing Chinese poetry from the Zhou Dynasty to modern times will be arranged.

    尼泊尔国王和首相分别举行茶会和宴会
    新华社加德满都26日电　周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和他们的随行人员25日十二点四十五分抵达尼泊尔首都加德满都。当他们乘坐的飞机在绿色的加德满都河谷降落时，他们受到阿查里雅首相和等候在机场的人群热烈而隆重的欢迎。
    在机场欢迎的人们给周恩来总理和贺龙副总理戴上了许多花环，向他们献了大量鲜花。周恩来总理和贺龙副总理在机场检阅了仪仗队。
    当中国客人们登上设在机场上的讲台时，前来欢迎的成千的男男女女以及少年儿童兴奋而激动地高呼欢迎口号，并且热烈鼓掌。
    周恩来总理发表了讲话。他说：“正如阿查里雅首相三个月前在北京所说的那样，我到这里访问也是把喜马拉雅山那一边的人民的友情带给喜马拉雅山这一边的人民。”他代表中国政府和中国人民向尼泊尔王国政府和尼泊尔人民热烈致意。
    周恩来总理回顾了两国人民之间在历史上长期友谊的发展。他说，这种友谊连喜马拉雅山也阻隔不了，而且经过了许多考验。他说，现在这种友谊是以和平共处的五项原则和万隆会议精神为基础的，“因此我们认为这种友谊的发展是促进世界和平的崇高事业的一部分”。
    周恩来总理在讲话中强调各国领袖之间的个人接触对增进国与国之间的谅解和合作与和平的重要性。他说，阿查里雅首相对中国的访问已经证明了这样一点，他表示希望：“这一次我们对尼泊尔的访问也将有助于我们的共同事业”。
    周恩来总理由阿查里雅首相陪同从机场乘敞篷汽车前往迎宾馆。当长列的汽车驶过加德满都郊区的街道时，聚集在路旁欢迎周恩来总理的群众越来越多。街道两旁满挂着旗帜和布幔。群众排成好几行站在马路旁、人行道上、台阶上和墙上。从沿街的房屋的每一层楼窗口，穿着节日服装的妇女和姑娘们探身窗外表示欢迎。他们中间许多人向周恩来总理和阿查里雅首相撒鲜花、花瓣、炒玉米，并且按照尼泊尔风俗撒朱砂粉。在有些地方，连屋顶上和树上也站着人。街道上挤得水泄不通。
    周恩来总理时时向欢迎的人合掌致意，他有时挥动花束，并把花束抛给欢迎的人群。许多人都伸出手来接他抛出的花束。
    从机场到迎宾馆一共有五英里路，中国总理和尼泊尔首相在汽车开到半路时，就从敞篷汽车上走了下来，登上华丽的御用马车。马车是由四匹栗色马拉的，其中两匹上面骑着穿红衣的骑士。这辆四轮马车由四名骑兵作前导，在欢呼声中慢慢地从街道两边拥挤的人群中通过。在至少有整整两英里长的一段路上，两旁一根接一根的彩色木杆上挂着三排长幅标语。沿路还搭了很多牌坊，有的上面画着周恩来总理的像。街上还挂着各种各样写在红布上的横幅标语，这些标语祝毛泽东主席、马亨德拉国王、周恩来总理和阿查里雅首相万岁，欢呼五项原则，欢呼亚洲各国团结。
    拉御用马车的骏马起先是在人群中慢慢地走着，后来就快速飞驰。当中国总理和尼泊尔首相到达迎宾馆的时候，他们从头到脚都给欢迎群众抛撒的朱砂粉染红了。
    贺龙元帅同尼泊尔国防大臣乘坐另一辆御用马车，走在周恩来总理和阿查里雅首相的车后。
    在离机场以前，周恩来向几十个尼泊尔和外国记者发表了谈话。他对记者们说，他很高兴有机会访问尼泊尔，他已经感到尼泊尔人民对中国人民的友谊。有记者问匈牙利和其他东欧国家的情况。周恩来回答说，“匈牙利情况正在越来越稳定，社会主义国家之间的关系在增进，它们之间的团结将进一步加强。”
    有记者问到阿富汗的情况，他回答说，“阿富汗一直在为民族独立而斗争。它已经获得了它的独立，现在正在进行国家建设。这给我很深的印象。”
    新华社加德满都26日电　尼泊尔国王马亨德拉25日下午5时在王宫接见了周恩来总理和贺龙副总理。随后国王又举行茶会招待他们。
    在这以前，在下午的时候，尼泊尔首相阿查里雅拜会了周恩来总理和贺龙副总理，周恩来和贺龙后来也拜会了尼泊尔首相。
    晚上8点钟，周恩来和贺龙以及随行人员出席了阿查里雅首相在堂皇富丽的回廊大厅中所举行的宴会。国王马亨德拉和王后、尼泊尔军政首脑们及各国外交使节都出席了这次宴会。周恩来和贺龙同尼泊尔国王、王后和首相在一起，坐在大厅中国王和王后的宝座前面的沙发上。席间陈设着桃花，盛开的桃花告诉人们春天已经到来。
    在国王来到以前，周恩来总理和贺龙副总理在大厅里参观飞金的柱子，欣赏木刻的神话人像和图案以及尼泊尔的绘画和雕刻，并且同尼泊尔的军政人员、尼泊尔各党派领袖以及各国外交使节交谈。在谈话中，尼泊尔外交大臣丘达·普拉萨德·夏尔马说，台湾代表留在联合国组织，是“一个大笑话”，周恩来说：“这害不着中国，但是不利于联合国组织。”尼泊尔外交大臣说：“我曾经在联合国说，如果没有中国代表参加联合国组织，亚洲问题就无法获得适当的解决。”
    晚上，中国客人们欣赏了表现出尼泊尔文化艺术特色的歌舞节目。在叫做“巴姜”的活泼的民间歌舞中，歌手们追述了尼泊尔同中国的由来已久的友好关系。这个歌还表达了尼泊尔人民接待中国总理的欢欣的心情。
    加德满都电台的负责人说，在过去的三天里，他的电台特别广播了关于中国的节目，其中包括关于中国的计划经济和中国的宪法的讲话等。这样的节目还要继续四天，并且将要安排介绍中国从周朝到现代的诗歌的讲话的节目。
