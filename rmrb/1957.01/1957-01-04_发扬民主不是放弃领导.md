Promoting Democracy is Not Abandoning Leadership
	Zhou Yifeng
	In some rural areas of Fujian Province, there were some problems in the work of democratic rectification of agricultural cooperatives. As a result, agricultural cooperative cadres dared not work, dared not adhere to the truth, and dared not adhere to policies. In Minpeng Cooperative, Jinfeng District, Changle County, three cooperative member households wanted to withdraw from the cooperative, but the cooperative director did not attempt to persuade and educate them. Bad elements took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying, "Now the government has a policy that families with more than five people can withdraw from the cooperative," causing ideological confusion among the masses. When district cadres proposed to track down the rumors, the cooperative director said, "Now that we are carrying out democratic rectification, how dare we criticize people?" In the Fuqi Cooperative of the same district, when building a seawall, the cadres said that going to work should be democratic, and they abandoned mobilization and organization work. As a result, no one went on the first day; on the second day, they needed one hundred people, but only twenty-odd people went. In the Xianfu Cooperative of the same district, a production team took peanuts and sold them themselves, without handing the money over to the cooperative, and the cooperative director dared not speak up. According to a survey of thirteen cooperatives by the Minhou County Party Committee, 178 out of 450 cooperative cadres were hesitant and dared not work boldly. They said: in the past, work was from top to bottom, but now it has to be from bottom to top, and they just nod when the masses tell them to. The cadres of the Aofeng Cooperative did not actively lead in the winter planting; after the Light Snow solar term, 300 mu of the 600 mu of wheat had not been planted. In addition, some cadres have another view, saying, "Democratic cooperative management means one hundred people, one hundred voices; if we want to complete the task, democracy won't work!"
	Among the masses, extreme democratic phenomena have also grown. In some places, if cadres speak a little louder, the masses say it is coercion and commandism; if they don't accept their opinions, they say it is bureaucracy. The cadres say: now it is "the top rectifying the bottom resisting," leaving them in a dilemma. For example, in the Xianfeng Cooperative in Changle County, during the autumn harvest, a cooperative member asked to pre-allocate grain, and the team leader said, "The grain is not dry yet." The cooperative member said, "I'll take it back and dry it myself," and the team leader said, "That's not easy to calculate." The cooperative member then criticized, "Has the rectification not reached your head yet?" During the autumn harvest in this cooperative, the cadres had to get up at four o'clock every morning and keep calling with a loudspeaker, otherwise the cooperative members would say: today there is nothing to do, we can sleep until eight o'clock.
	Of course, these problems do not mean that the policy of democratic cooperative management is incorrect. Before the autumn harvest, Fujian paid special attention to promoting democracy and following the mass line in the province-wide rectification movement and general election movement, which played a great role in arousing the enthusiasm of the masses and consolidating cooperatives. However, some cadres have a one-sided understanding of the policy of democratic cooperative management, thinking that since it is democratic cooperative management, they can only listen to the masses, and not listening is undemocratic; since they have to follow the mass line, they have to "follow the masses." Therefore, when publicizing the policy of democratic cooperative management, they only emphasize "promoting democracy" without explaining the purpose of promoting democracy and the relationship between promoting democracy and strengthening leadership; they only criticize shortcomings in work without affirming achievements, and without distinguishing responsibilities, pushing everything onto the cadres. As a result, the rectification of cooperatives became the "rectification" of people. Although this situation is a minority, it is not isolated. The consequences of this approach will not be better than coercion and commandism. Facts have proved that as a result of this, the purpose of arousing the enthusiasm of the masses, enhancing the consciousness of cooperative members as masters of their own affairs, and consolidating cooperatives has not been achieved; the ideological obstacles of cadres towards promoting democracy have not been eliminated, and what it has brought is only negative emotions. Without democracy, it is impossible to consolidate cooperatives, but extreme democracy is also detrimental to consolidating cooperatives.
	Currently, many regions are carrying out the work of democratic rectification of cooperatives. I believe that in addition to paying attention to correcting the problems mentioned above in places where they have occurred, all regions should pay attention from the beginning in their work: democratic education should be comprehensive and correct, both to promote the enthusiasm of cooperative members and not to hurt the enthusiasm of grassroots cadres.

    发扬民主不是放弃领导
    周一风
    福建省部分农村在民主整社的工作上有些毛病，结果，出现了农业社干部不敢工作、不敢坚持真理、不敢坚持政策的现象。长乐县金峰区闽鹏社三户社员要退社，社长不去进行说服教育。坏分子乘机造谣说，“现在政府有政策，五口以上的可以退社”，引起群众思想混乱。区干部提出要追谣，社长说：“现在民主整社，还敢批评人家吗？”同区浮歧社，在修海堤的时候，干部说出工要讲民主，放弃了动员和组织工作，结果第一天一个人也没去；第二天要一百人，只去了二十多人。同区仙富社，一个生产队拿花生自己去卖了，钱不交给社，社长也不敢去讲。据闽侯县委对十三个社的调查统计，四百五十个社干部中，有一百七十八人缩手缩脚，不敢大胆工作。他们说：过去工作是自上而下，现在要自下而上了，群众叫点头就点头。敖峰社的干部在冬种当中不积极领导，小雪过了，六百亩小麦还有三百亩没种。除此而外，有的干部还有另外一种看法，说“民主办社，一百个人一百个声音；要完成任务，讲民主不行！”
    在群众当中，极端民主的现象也滋长了。有的地方，干部讲话大声一些，群众就说是强迫命令；稍不接受意见，就说是官僚主义。干部说：现在是“上整下顶”，左右为难。如长乐县先锋社，在秋收的时候，一个社员要求预支粮食，队长说“谷还没干”；社员说“我挑回去自己晒”，队长说“这样不好算”。社员就批评说：“整社还没整到你头上？”这个社在秋收当中，每天要干部早上四点钟就起来拿着广播筒一直叫，不然社员就说：今天没事，可以睡到八点钟了。
    当然这些问题并不能说明民主办社的方针是不正确的。秋收以前，福建在全省性的整社运动和普选运动当中，特别注意了发扬民主和走群众路线，这对发扬群众积极性、巩固合作社起了很大作用。但是，有些干部对民主办社方针的理解有片面性，以为既然是民主办社，就只能听群众的，不听就是不民主；既然要走群众路线，就要“跟着群众走”。因此，宣传民主办社方针的时候，只强调“发扬民主”，不说明发扬民主的目的及发扬民主和加强领导的关系；只批评工作中的缺点，不肯定成绩，也不分清责任，把一切都推到干部身上。结果，整社变成了“整”人。这种情况虽然是少数的，但并不是个别的。这种作法造成的后果决不会比强迫命令好些。事实证明：这样作的结果，发扬群众积极性、提高社员主人翁自觉、巩固合作社的目的并没有达到；干部当中对于发扬民主的思想障碍也没有消除，带来的只是消极情绪。没有民主不可能巩固合作社，但极端民主对巩固合作社也是不利的。
    目前，许多地区正在进行民主整社工作。我认为：除了发生以上问题的地方要注意纠正外，各地在工作当中一开始就要注意：民主教育要全面、正确，既要发扬社员群众的积极性，也不可伤害了基层干部的积极性。
