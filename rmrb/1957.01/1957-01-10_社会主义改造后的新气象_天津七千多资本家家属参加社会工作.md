    New Atmosphere After Socialist Transformation
    Over 7,000 Capitalist Family Members in Tianjin Participate in Social Work
    (Xinhua News Agency) Tianjin: Currently, over 7,000 family members of capitalists in Tianjin have participated in various social work and political theory studies.

    The vast majority of them used to only care about family life, some only paying attention to eating, drinking, and having fun, and even neglecting household chores. Now, they not only begin to care about national affairs, encourage their relatives to actively accept socialist transformation, but also are willing to do something for society themselves. Hu Jingyun, the wife of Yang Yi, the private-side deputy director of the No. 1 Joint State-Private Steel Rolling Mill, used to employ four workers at home and never participated in labor. Now, she not only personally manages household affairs and educates her children, but also serves as a committee member of the "Hexi District Industrialist and Businessman Family Learning Branch," becoming an active organizer of political studies for industrial and commercial families in this district. Jiang En'tian, a capitalist family member who graduated from the Foreign Languages Department of Tsinghua University 23 years ago, felt that she had fallen behind after seeing the rapid changes in the motherland. After returning from the National Congress of Industrialist and Businessman Families and Female Industrial and Business Representatives in Beijing, she began to review English and translated an American novel of 90,000 words in just three months. Shen Enxiu, a capitalist family member participating in a teacher training class, has recently become a language teacher in a workers' after-school school. Some people have been elected as representatives to the district people's congresses and people's jurors due to their active work and attention to connecting with the masses. Many people have participated in childcare work, and they have established fifteen nurseries to help employees and cadres solve childcare problems.

    In addition to organizing capitalist family members with self-study abilities to learn, the Tianjin Municipal Democratic Women's Federation also organizes radio lectures for thousands of capitalist family members with lower cultural levels and busy housework to help them improve their political awareness.

    社会主义改造后的新气象
    天津七千多资本家家属参加社会工作
    据新华社讯　天津市目前已经有七千多个资本家家属参加各种社会工作和政治理论学习。
    她们当中的绝大部分人过去只关心家庭生活，有的只注意吃喝玩乐，甚至连家务事都不料理。现在，他们不但开始关心国家大事，鼓励自己的亲人积极接受社会主义改造，而且自己也愿意为社会作些事情。公私合营轧钢一厂副厂长、私方人员杨义的爱人胡静云，过去家里雇了四个工人，自己从不参加劳动，现在她不但亲自操持家务、教育子女，还担任了“河西区工商业者家属学习分会”的委员，成为这个区的工商界家属政治学习的积极组织者。二十三年以前在清华大学外文系毕业的资本家家属蒋恩钿，看到祖国突飞猛进的变化，感到自己是落后了，她从北京参加全国工商业者家属和女工商业者代表会议回来以后，就开始重温英文，并且在短短的三个月内翻译了一部九万字的美国小说。参加师资训练班学习的资本家家属沈恩秀，最近已经成为一个工人业余学校的语文教师。还有一些人因工作积极、注意联系群众，被选为区人民代表大会的代表和人民陪审员。许多人参加了托儿保育工作，她们已经兴办了十五个托儿所，帮助职工和干部解决托儿问题。
    天津市民主妇女联合会除了组织有自学能力的资本家家属学习以外，还为数以千计的文化水平较低而家务较忙的资本家家属组织广播讲座，帮助她们提高政治觉悟。
