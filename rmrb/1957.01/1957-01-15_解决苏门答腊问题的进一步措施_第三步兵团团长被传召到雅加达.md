Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 14th: Samosir, commander of the Third Infantry Regiment of the First Military Region stationed in Tarutung, North Sumatra, arrived in Jakarta on the 13th. He was summoned by Army Chief of Staff Nasution. That evening, he reported to Nasution on the situation in Tarutung.

In an interview with newspaper reporters, Samosir admitted that Simbolon had fled to Tarutung after the failure of the rebellion. However, he said that he did not know Simbolon's current whereabouts.

Samosir said that the situation in Tarutung was "very calm," but the transportation of materials was hampered, and no ships had entered the port of Tarutung yet.

After Lieutenant Colonel Djatikusumo took over command of the First Military Region from Simbolon, Samosir had announced that he would not obey the leadership of the First Military Region commander but would only obey the command of the Army Chief of Staff, and repeatedly delayed his arrival in Jakarta. Samosir's arrival in Jakarta is seen as a further measure taken by the Indonesian Army leadership to resolve the military problem in Sumatra.

    解决苏门答腊问题的进一步措施
    第三步兵团团长被传召到雅加达
    新华社雅加达14日电　驻扎在北苏门答腊打板奴里的第一军区第三步兵团团长沙莫西尔13日来到雅加达。他是奉陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安的传召来的。当天晚上他就向纳苏蒂安报告了打板奴里的情况。
    沙莫西尔在同报纸记者谈话时承认，西姆波朗在叛变失败以后逃到了打板奴里，但是，他说，他不知道西姆波朗现在在什么地方。
    沙莫西尔说，打板奴里的情况“很平静”，但是物资运输受到阻碍，至今还没有一艘轮船开进打板奴里的码头。
    沙莫西尔在京廷中校从西姆波朗手中接管了第一军区的指挥权以后，曾经宣布不服从第一军区司令的领导，而只听陆军参谋长的指挥，并且一再延迟到雅加达来的时间。这次沙莫西尔的到雅加达，被认为是印度尼西亚陆军领导上为解决苏门答腊军事问题而采取的进一步措施。
