    Soviet People Welcome Premier Zhou Enlai
    By Our Correspondents in the Soviet Union, Li He, Dai Feng
    Since the announcement of Premier Zhou Enlai's upcoming visit to the Soviet Union, the Soviet people have eagerly awaited this day. Acquaintances would meet and ask, "On what day in early January will Premier Zhou Enlai arrive in Moscow?" When they learned he would arrive on January 7th, they counted the days and speculated about which comrades would be accompanying him.
    Finally, January 7th – a memorable day – arrived.
    Premier Zhou Enlai, leading the government delegation aboard a "Tu-104" aircraft, departed from Beijing at 9:30 AM Beijing time. Two and a half hours later, they entered Soviet territory for the first time in Irkutsk. The people of Irkutsk warmly welcomed their closest friends and brothers who were visiting for the first time in 1957. Irkutsk hailed Premier Zhou's visit as a "new blossom of unbreakable Sino-Soviet friendship."
    On January 5th, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Fedrin, Soviet Ambassador to the People's Republic of China Yudin, and Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Liu Xiao traveled from Moscow to Irkutsk to join the local people in welcoming the Chinese government delegation.
    On the morning of January 7th, golden sunlight shone through the clouds onto the vast Irkutsk Airport. Although the Siberian cold was at minus thirty degrees Celsius, and despite news of a flight delay, the people of Irkutsk began gathering at the airport from 7:00 AM. Dressed in fur coats and padded jackets, and wearing high-top warm boots, they were still unable to resist the cold's onslaught, and people were jumping to keep warm. When reporters approached the Irkutsk people and asked if they were cold, they replied: Our hearts are warm! Among the welcoming crowd, reporters also encountered builders from the newly constructed city of Angarsk, sixty kilometers away from Irkutsk. A man named Ivanov told reporters that he had brought his entire family of four, having rushed to Irkutsk early in the morning.
    At 12:10 PM, the plane carrying the Chinese government delegation landed at Irkutsk Airport. As the cabin door opened, Premier Zhou emerged from the plane, smiling and waving to the welcoming crowd. Instantly, the welcoming crowd, lined up on both sides of the airport gate, broke through the guard lines, shouting greetings and rushing towards Premier Zhou. As Premier Zhou and others walked from the airport to the banquet venue, the crowd chanted "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!" At the banquet, Premier Zhou raised his glass to toast the achievements of the Irkutsk people. When he said in Russian, "To the victory of communist construction!" the whole room erupted in applause.
    After the forty-minute banquet, as Premier Zhou and others walked back to the airport, the welcoming crowd remained, watching the guests board the plane. The plane took off again amidst the strains of the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union.
    As they were approaching Omsk, a Soviet female flight attendant told the guests that the climate in Omsk was below minus thirty degrees Celsius. When the delegation disembarked at Omsk Airport, more than one hundred representatives from all sectors of Omsk had gathered at the airport. At the banquet, the people of Omsk entertained the guests with the famous Siberian dumplings. Soviet comrades told reporters: Premier Zhou is a messenger of peace, coming from the tropics to the frigid zone. At the banquet, workers from the Omsk Radio Factory presented Premier Zhou with a new-style radio. Citizens of Omsk requested to be able to hear Premier Zhou's speech through radio broadcasts. Premier Zhou granted the request of the citizens of Omsk, recording a message for Omsk Radio, congratulating the Omsk people on their new achievements in building communism.
    While the silver swallow carrying Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and other members of our government delegation was still traversing the clouds over the East at an altitude of over ten thousand meters, and while Premier Zhou was still being greeted in Irkutsk and Omsk, the Soviet capital Moscow was already filled with an atmosphere of welcoming the envoys of the People's China. The "Pravda" newspaper, with a circulation of 5.5 million copies, announced to the entire Soviet Union in a prominent position at the masthead, "Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Comrade He Long, Vice Premier, and accompanying personnel will arrive in Moscow today for a friendly visit," and wrote in Russian and Chinese: "Warm greetings to the representatives of the fraternal Chinese people!" "Pravda" published large photographs of Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long, along with biographies of the two, and published an editorial "May the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people continue to develop and consolidate."
    After "Pravda" published the full text of the "People's Daily" article "Once Again on the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," before Premier Zhou arrived in Moscow, the "Pravda" publishing house printed this article as a separate booklet, twice, for a total of one million copies. This document is the latest of more than 370 types of Chinese works published in Russian in recent years, totaling about 20 million copies.
    The Soviet people's interest in and research on People's China is deepening with the growth of friendship. The Soviet Academy of Sciences is establishing a Chinese Institute, which will study Chinese politics, economy, culture, and other issues, as well as the history of Chinese language, literature, and the history of China's international relations. A Chinese Film Week is also about to begin in Moscow.
    Premier Zhou's visit to the Soviet Union, as Soviet comrades said, is a major event in the development of deep Sino-Soviet friendship, bringing a clear feeling of a significant increase in Sino-Soviet friendship.
    Today, before 4:00 PM Moscow time, Moscow's Vnukovo Airport, decorated with the national flags of China and the Soviet Union, was crowded with Soviet government and party leaders, ministers, representatives from all walks of life, foreign envoys to the Soviet Union, and personnel from the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union. Everyone eagerly awaited the arrival of the Chinese government delegation.
    At exactly 4:00 PM, a giant silver plane flew in from the east and landed in front of the welcoming crowd. The cabin door opened. Premier Zhou Enlai, full of vigor, and Vice Premier He Long, wearing a marshal's uniform, and other members of the delegation, disembarked one after another. Chairman Voroshilov of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Chairman Bulganin of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and First Secretary Khrushchev of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and other Soviet party and government personnel immediately stepped forward to greet them, warmly shaking hands with the Chinese comrades. Then, they took a group photo in front of the plane. At this time, the band played the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union. Premier Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Chairman Bulganin, reviewed the guard of honor and shook hands with the Soviet ministers and foreign envoys to the Soviet Union. As Premier Zhou waved to the representatives from all walks of life with a smile, warm applause resounded at the airport. Then, Chairman Bulganin and Premier Zhou delivered speeches one after the other.
    The Chinese government delegation, accompanied by Soviet leaders, left the airport and headed towards Moscow. From Kaluga Street near the airport to the Kremlin in the city center, national flags of China and the Soviet Union and welcome slogans written in Chinese and Russian were hung everywhere, and the route was warmly welcomed by dense crowds of people. On Kaluga Street, a very eye-catching red banner was also hung, written in Russian and Chinese: "Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people!"
    Today, the citizens of Moscow saw the enthusiastic scene at Vnukovo Airport on television, sharing the friendship and joy with those who went to the airport to welcome the Chinese government delegation. (Moscow, 7th dispatch)

    苏联人民欢迎周恩来总理
    本报驻苏联记者　李何　戴枫
    自从周恩来总理将要访问苏联的消息发表以后，苏联人民就迫切地期待着这一天的到来。熟悉的人们见面就问：“周恩来总理将在1月上旬的哪一天到达莫斯科？”当人们知道他在1月7日会到来以后，他们就屈指计算还有几天，估计一起来的会有那些同志。
    终于，1月7日——这个值得纪念的日子到来了。
    周恩来总理率领政府代表团，乘“图—104”飞机，在北京时间上午九时三十分从北京起飞，两个半小时后，就进入苏联国土的第一个地方伊尔库次克。伊尔库次克人民热烈地欢迎了1957年第一次来到这里的最亲密的朋友和兄弟。伊尔库次克把周总理的访问称之为“牢不可破的苏中友谊的新花朵”。
    1月5日，苏联外交部副部长费德林、苏联驻中华人民共和国大使尤金和中华人民共和国驻苏联大使刘晓从莫斯科来到伊尔库次克，同当地人民一起迎接中国政府代表团。
    1月7日清晨，金色的阳光穿过云层照射到广阔的伊尔库次克机场上。虽然这里已是西伯利亚零下三十度的严寒，虽然传出了飞机要迟到的消息，但是，从上午七时开始，伊尔库次克人民逐渐在飞机场上结集起来。他们穿着皮袄和棉大衣，穿着高统暖鞋，可是还不能抵住严寒的侵袭，人们都跳动着取暖。当记者走到伊尔库次克人面前问他们冷不冷时，他们说：心是暖的！在欢迎的人群中，记者还碰到了离伊尔库次克六十公里远、新建的安加尔斯克城的建设者们，一位名叫伊万诺夫的告诉记者说，他带着全家四口，从一清早就赶到伊尔库次克来了。
    十二时十分，载着中国政府代表团的飞机降落到伊尔库次克飞机场上。舱门打开后，周总理走出飞机微笑着向欢迎的人群招手致意。顷刻间，排列在飞机场大门内两旁的欢迎的群众，冲开了警卫的队伍，高呼欢迎，一直冲到周总理身边。当周总理等从飞机场走向设宴的地方的时候，一路上群众高呼“苏中友谊万岁！”的口号。在宴会上，周总理举杯为伊尔库次克人民建设的成就而干杯。在他用俄文说了一句“为共产主义建设的胜利而干杯！”的时候，全场响起一片掌声。
    四十多分钟的宴会结束以后，周总理等走回飞机场的时候，欢迎的群众仍然未散，他们一直看着客人们上了飞机。飞机又在苏中两国国歌声中起飞了。
    快要到达鄂木斯克的时候，飞机上的苏联女乘务员对客人们说，鄂木斯克的气候在零下三十度以下。代表团到鄂木斯克飞机场下飞机的时候，飞机场上已经集合了鄂木斯克各界代表一百多人。在宴会上，鄂木斯克人民以出名的西伯利亚饺子招待客人们。苏联同志对记者说：周总理是和平的使者，他从热带来到了寒带。宴会上，鄂木斯克收音机工厂的工人们送给周总理一架新式收音机。鄂木斯克市民们要求能够通过无线电广播听到周总理的讲话。周总理答应了鄂木斯克市民的要求，为鄂木斯克广播电台录了音，祝贺鄂木斯克人民在建设共产主义中获得新的成就。
    当载着周恩来总理、贺龙副总理以及我国政府代表团其他人员的银燕还在穿越东方一万公尺以上高空的云层的时候，当周总理还在伊尔库次克和鄂木斯克接受人们的迎接的时候，苏联首都莫斯科已经洋溢着欢迎人民中国的使者的气氛了。发行五百五十万份的“真理报”在惹人注目的报头地位向全苏联人民宣布“中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来同志、副总理贺龙同志和随行人员今天将到达莫斯科作友好的访问”，并且以俄文和中文写道：“向兄弟般的中国人民的代表们致热烈的敬礼！”“真理报”刊载了周恩来总理和贺龙副总理的大幅照片和两人的传记，发表了“愿苏中两国人民牢不可破的友谊不断发展和巩固”的社论。
    在“真理报”全文刊载了“人民日报”文章“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”以后，在周总理到达莫斯科之前，“真理报”出版社又把这篇文章印成单行本，两次共印一百万份。这个文件是苏联几年来以俄文出版的三百七十多种、约二千万册的我国作品的最新的一种。
    苏联人民对于人民中国的兴趣和研究，正在随着友谊的增长而不断加深。苏联科学院正在创办中国研究所，它将研究中国的政治、经济、文化等问题，中国的语言、文学的历史和中国的国际关系的历史。一个中国电影周也快要在莫斯科开始了。
    周总理访问苏联，正如苏联同志所说的，是中苏深厚友谊发展的重大事件，它给人们带来中苏友谊显著增长的鲜明的感觉。
    今天莫斯科时间下午四时以前，悬挂着中苏两国国旗的莫斯科伏努科夫飞机场上，聚集着苏联政府和党的领导人员、各部部长、各界代表、各国驻苏使节以及我国驻苏联大使馆的人员。大家热情地等待着中国政府代表团的到来。
    四时正，巨型的银色飞机从东面飞来，落到欢迎的人群的面前。舱门打开了。精神奕奕的周恩来总理和穿着元帅服的贺龙副总理以及代表团其他人员相继走下飞机。苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫、苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联共产党第一书记赫鲁晓夫以及苏联其他党政人员立刻上前迎接，同中国同志们热烈地握手。接着，他们在飞机面前合照了像。这时，乐队奏起了中苏两国国歌。周恩来总理在布尔加宁主席陪同下检阅了仪仗队，并同苏联部长们和外国驻苏使节们一一握了手。当周总理向各界代表含笑招手致意的时候，飞机场上响起了热烈的掌声。然后，布尔加宁主席和周总理先后致词。
    中国政府代表团在苏联领导人的陪同下离开飞机场到莫斯科城里来。从飞机场附近的卡鲁加大街直到市中心的克里姆林宫前，一路上到处都悬挂着中苏两国国旗和中俄文写的欢迎标语，沿路受到密密层层的人群的热烈欢迎。在卡鲁加大街上还悬挂着一幅十分惹人注目的、用俄文和中文写的红色标语：“苏中两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！”
    今天，莫斯科的市民们都从电视里看到了伏努科夫飞机场上的热烈场面，他们同去到飞机场上欢迎中国政府代表团的人们共享了友谊和欢乐。　（莫斯科7日电）
