    Cooperation is Strength, Turning Calamity into Auspiciousness
    Fujian Province's Grain Output Exceeds 1957 Target Despite Suffering from Floods, Droughts, and Typhoons
    Relying on the Strength of Cooperatives to Fight Drought, Hunan and Guangxi Still Achieve Good Harvests in Agricultural Production

    Fuzhou Dispatch: In 1956, Fujian Province achieved a significant victory in grain production. According to preliminary calculations, the province's total grain output (including soybeans) reached 9 billion jin, an increase of 1.3 billion jin (16%) compared to 1955, exceeding the 1957 increase target by 8.4%, and an increase of 33% compared to the highest annual output before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Grain yield per unit area also greatly improved in 1956. The average yield per mu reached 454 jin, an increase of 12.5% compared to 1955 (403 jin per mu). Longxi, Haicheng, and Changle counties, traditionally known for high yields, have become the first counties in Fujian Province to achieve a thousand jin of rice per mu. In the Minnan and Minjiang River downstream plains, a small number of fields achieved an average yield of over 2,000 jin per mu. Even in the mountainous areas of northern Fujian, over 4,000 mu of thousand-jin rice paddies appeared.

    Fujian Province experienced continuous and severe water, drought, and typhoon disasters in 1956. The drought-affected area in summer reached over 4.88 million mu, and the flood-affected area in autumn reached 2.04 million mu. The intensity of the floods and typhoons was rare in many years. Under the leadership and support of Party and government organs at all levels, the province's agricultural cooperatives relied on the immense strength of collective management to carry out heroic struggles against these disasters. Before the disasters occurred, over 95,000 water conservancy projects were built, benefiting over 3.7 million mu of rice fields. When the disasters occurred, rapid rescue operations were carried out. These efforts greatly reduced the losses caused by the disasters.

    On the basis of agricultural cooperativization, the province promoted a series of technical reforms that could not be widely promoted in the past, especially increasing the multiple cropping index and changing the rice cultivation system, resulting in significant yield increases. The province expanded the winter planting area by 1 million mu, promoted double-cropping rice on 1.84 million mu, and changed intercropping to continuous cropping on 550,000 mu. These measures alone increased grain production by over 600 million jin. The increase in grain production will bring more improvement to the lives of farmers in Fujian Province. The province's increased grain production, averaged across the province's population, amounts to an increase of 73 jin per person. The number of grain-deficient households in rural areas will be greatly reduced, and the number of self-sufficient and surplus grain households will greatly increase. The spring and summer famines that have continued for many years will be basically eliminated.

    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha: In the first year of agricultural cooperativization in Hunan Province in 1956, over 90,000 agricultural cooperatives fought tenaciously against a drought unseen in decades. As a result, although the province's total grain output decreased by 3 billion jin compared to the bumper year of 1955, it was still 200 million jin higher than the highest pre-liberation production level in 1936. Compared with 1955, other crops increased, cotton increased by 15.4%, jute increased by 113.9%, ramie increased by 29.7%, tea increased by 13.6%, and oil crops such as rapeseed, peanuts, and sesame increased by 14%. The total value of agricultural and sideline production in the province still reached more than 90% of 1955. About 45% of the agricultural cooperatives in the province increased production compared to 1955, and about 10% maintained the production of 1955. The remaining cooperatives reduced production. Pingjiang, Linli, Shimen, Cili and other counties also achieved more than 90% of agricultural cooperatives increasing production, and more than 90% of members increasing income.

    Agricultural cooperatives in various places also overcame many difficulties in autumn sowing and winter sowing. In the Shaoyang area, which was most severely affected by the drought, 85% of the fields could not be plowed and sown after the autumn harvest, but more than 9,300 agricultural cooperatives in the area have taken various measures to rush irrigation, plowing, and sowing. Up to now, the area has completed 1.21 million mu of autumn sowing, an increase of 98% compared to 1955; and 5.15 million mu of winter sowing, an increase of 70% compared to 1955.

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning: Fifteen directly administered counties in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture encountered a severe drought in the second half of 1956, but the annual grain output still increased by about 14% compared to last year.

    Over the past year, many agricultural cooperatives in these counties have carried out production reforms and built water conservancy projects. Therefore, the early rice output increased by more than 400 million jin compared to 1955, laying the foundation for the year's increase in production.

    In the second half of the year, the drought-affected area of grain crops in various places reached more than 3.8 million mu, accounting for 23.8% of the total area. The leading organs promptly proposed the method of "lining up seedlings, distinguishing priorities according to the conditions of different regions, abandoning those without conditions for drought resistance, and concentrating all efforts to rescue those with conditions for drought resistance," leading the peasants to persist in more than two months of arduous struggle, rescuing more than 2.4 million mu of drought-affected crops, and reducing losses.

    遭受水旱风灾袭击的  福建省粮食产量超过1957年指标
    依靠合作化力量向旱灾作斗争  湖南广西农业生产仍有好收成
    本报福州电　1956年福建省粮食生产取得了重大胜利。据初步计算，全省粮食（包括大豆）总产量达到九十亿斤，比1955年增加十三亿斤（增产16％），已经超过1957年增产指标8.4％，比抗日战争前最高年产量增加33％。1956年粮食单位面积产量也有很大提高。去年粮食每亩平均产量达到四百五十四斤，比1955年（每亩产量是四百零三斤）增加12.5％。一向以高产著称的龙溪、海澄、长乐三县，已经成为福建省首次出现的水稻千斤县。闽南和闽江下游平原地区有少数田地平均每亩产量达到二千斤以上。连闽北山区也出现了千斤稻田四千多亩。
    福建省1956年不断发生严重的水、旱、风灾，夏季受旱面积达四百八十八万多亩，秋季水灾面积达二百零四万亩。洪水、台风的猛烈，是多年少见的。全省的农业社在各级党政机关的领导和支持下，依靠集体经营的巨大力量同这些灾害进行了英勇的斗争。在灾害发生之前，各地兴修了水利工程九万五千多处，使三百七十多万亩稻田收到效益。灾害发生的时候，各地又迅速进行了抢救。这些努力大大减轻了灾害造成的损失。
    全省在农业合作化的基础上推行了过去无法大量推行的一系列的技术改革，特别是提高复种指数，改变水稻耕作制度，收到很大的增产效果。全省扩大冬种面积一百万亩，推广双季稻一百八十四万亩，间作改连作五十五万亩。靠着这几项措施，就增产了粮食六亿多斤。粮食的增产将使福建省农民的生活获得更多的改善。全省增产的粮食，按全省人口平均，每人可增加七十三斤。农村缺粮户将大大减少，自足户和余粮户也将大大增加。多少年来延续不断的春夏荒，将基本消灭。
    据新华社长沙电　湖南省在1956年实现农业合作化的第一年中，九万多个农业社同数十年未有的旱灾作了顽强的斗争。结果，全省粮食总产量虽然比丰收的1955年减产三十亿斤。但是仍然比解放前生产水平最高的1936年增产两亿斤。其他农作物和1955年比较，棉花增产15.4％，黄麻增产113.9％，苎麻增产29.7％，茶叶增产13.6％，菜籽、花生、芝麻等油料作物增产14％。全省农副业生产总值仍然达到1955年的90％以上。全省有45％左右的农业社比1955年增产，10％左右的农业社保持1955年的产量。其余的社减产。平江、临澧、石门、慈利等县还做到了90％以上的农业社增了产，90％以上的社员增加了收入。
    各地农业社在秋种和冬种中也克服了很多的困难。受旱最重的邵阳专区，秋收以后有85％的田不能耕翻播种，但是全专区九千三百多个农业社已经采取各种各样的办法抢灌、抢翻、抢种。到目前为止，全专区已经完成秋种一百二十一万亩，比1955年增加98％；冬种五百一十五万亩，比1955年增加70％。
    据新华社南宁电　桂西僮族自治州十五个直属县1956年下半年遇到严重干旱，但是全年粮食产量仍然比去年增产一成四左右。
    一年来，这些县的许多农业社都进行了生产改革，兴修水利。因此，早稻比1955年增产四亿多斤，奠定了全年的增产基础。
    下半年各地粮食作物受旱面积达三百八十多万亩，占总面积23.8％。领导机关及时提出“禾苗排队，根据不同地区的情况，分别轻重缓急，没有条件抗旱的放弃，有条件抗旱的集中全力抢救”的办法，领导农民坚持两个多月的艰苦斗争，共挽救了二百四十多万亩受旱作物，减少了损失。
