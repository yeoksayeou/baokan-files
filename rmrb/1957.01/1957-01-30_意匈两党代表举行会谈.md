Xinhua News Agency, January 29th: A formal declaration released in Budapest on January 28th stated:

    After visiting Moscow, Comrade Longo, Deputy Secretary-General of the Italian Communist Party, and others had the opportunity to meet with Comrade Kádár, Comrade Kish, and Comrade Münnich, representatives of the Provisional Executive Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party. During the talks, the leaders of the two fraternal parties exchanged information and views on issues of concern to both parties.
    The Italian comrades especially gave a positive appraisal of the efforts made by the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party in opposing anti-socialist reactionaries, in correcting past mistakes, and in healing the wounds inflicted by the counter-revolution.
    The Italian comrades hope that the workers, working people, and all progressive forces in Hungary will, in the interest of further consolidating the people's democratic system, reunite around the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government as soon as possible, and hope that they will freely and independently build socialism in their own country.
