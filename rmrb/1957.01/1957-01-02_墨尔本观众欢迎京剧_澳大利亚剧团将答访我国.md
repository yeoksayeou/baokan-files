Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, January 1st: The Chinese Art Troupe, currently touring Australia, arrived in Adelaide yesterday from Melbourne.

The Chinese Art Troupe gave twenty performances in Melbourne, garnering unanimous praise from audiences and critics alike. The farewell performance featured unforgettable scenes. The stage was filled with colorful confetti and paper streamers thrown by the audience, as well as flowers, horseshoe-shaped, and arrow-shaped bouquets presented by theater enthusiasts.

Garnet Carroll, one of Australia's leading figures in the theatrical industry, said he had never witnessed such a spectacle. After the actors took repeated curtain calls lasting ten minutes, Xu Guangxiao, head of the Chinese Art Troupe, addressed the audience, expressing his gratitude. He announced that arrangements had been made to send an Australian theater troupe to visit China early next year. His words were met with thunderous applause.

During its three-week stay in Melbourne, the Chinese Art Troupe was invited to give a special television performance, filmed a Technicolor documentary, and made several recordings.

Peking Opera actors were invited to attend three Christmas parties held in the hot climate. At a garden party held by Australian friends and overseas Chinese, young members of the art troupe competed with their hosts in softball. The "Beijing Team vs. Melbourne Team" game resulted in a 20-8 victory for the visiting team.

    墨尔本观众欢迎京剧
    澳大利亚剧团将答访我国
    新华社1日讯　墨尔本消息：现在澳大利亚各地巡回演出的中国艺术团昨天从墨尔本抵达阿得雷德。
    中国艺术团在墨尔本举行了二十次演出，获得观众和剧评家的一致赞扬。在告别演出中出现了令人难忘的场面。舞台上满是观众抛上去的五彩碎纸和纸条，以及戏剧爱好者送来的鲜花、马蹄形和飞箭形的花束。
    澳大利亚的戏剧业巨头之一加尼特·卡罗尔说，他从来没有看到过这样的盛况。在演员们一再谢幕历时十分钟后，中国艺术团团长徐光霄致词向观众表示感谢。他宣布，已经安排好在明年初派一个澳大利亚剧团访问中国。他的话获得了雷一般的欢呼声。
    中国艺术团在墨尔本逗留三个星期中，应邀举行了一次特别电视演出、拍了一张五彩纪录片和录了几次音。
    京剧演员应邀参加了在炎热的气候中举行的三次圣诞节宴会。在澳大利亚朋友和华侨举行的一次园游会上，艺术团青年团员们同主人们比赛垒球，“北京队对墨尔本队”的比赛结果客队以二十对八获胜。
