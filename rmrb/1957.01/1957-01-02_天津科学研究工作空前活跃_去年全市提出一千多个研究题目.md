Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 30th -- Tianjin's scientific workers proposed over a thousand scientific research topics in 1956. Research work is showing an unprecedentedly active atmosphere.

Of the city's more than 3,000 intellectuals capable of engaging in scientific research, the majority of them systematically began research work in 1956. Among them are many experts who were previously entangled in administrative affairs and social activities and unable to conduct research. Yang Shixian, Vice President of Nankai University and an organic chemist, after completing the research of "Synthesis of Several New Plant Stimulants", which is very valuable to agricultural and forestry production, is guiding young scientific workers in conducting research on phosphorus-containing organic compounds. Zhang Guofan, Vice President of Tianjin University and a physicist, has also completed a paper on applied mathematics, proposing a simple and effective new method for "solving partial differential equations." He is now studying "turbulence theory" related to aviation and water conservancy. Under the guidance of many experts, more and more young teachers are joining scientific research. Tianjin University alone has more than 130 young teachers participating in scientific research work.

A feature of Tianjin's scientific research work in 1956 was that research topics combining production and construction accounted for a considerable proportion. Cui Cheng, a plant physiologist, researched an irrigation scheme that can both save water and increase yield for the purpose of increasing the production of Tianjin Xiaozhan rice, which has received attention from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In addition, research on preventing chemical solutions from corroding machines, automation of enamel factories, and how to save steel and cement in winter construction are all very valuable for solving practical production problems. The research of Tianjin University teachers on short-distance transmission lines, welding rod formulations, etc., has been welcomed by the adopting departments.

The Tianjin medical community proposed more than 400 research topics in 1956. Orthopedic expert Fang Xianzhi is conducting research on bone joint transplantation. Oncology expert Jin Xianzai has compiled experience in extended surgical treatment of breast cancer, etc. Among the fifty studies on sorting out the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine conducted by more than one hundred traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in Tianjin, twenty have initially confirmed the therapeutic effect.

With the development of scientific research activities, Tianjin established eighteen scientific research institutions in industry, health, and other fields in 1956. Universities and medical circles have also expanded or built new laboratories and increased instruments and equipment.

    天津科学研究工作空前活跃
    去年全市提出一千多个研究题目
    新华社天津30日电　天津市的科学工作者在1956年提出了一千多个科学研究题目。研究工作呈现出前所未有的活跃气象。
    全市三千多名能从事科学研究的知识分子中，大部分人在1956年都有步骤地开始了研究工作，他们当中有不少是过去被行政事务和社会活动纠缠而不能进行研究工作的专家。南开大学副校长、有机化学家杨石先在完成了对农林业生产很有价值的“若干新植物刺激素合成”的研究以后，正指导青年科学工作者进行含磷的有机化合物的研究工作。天津大学副校长、物理学家张国藩也完成了一篇应用数学方面的论文，他提出了“求偏微分方程”的简捷、有效的新方法。现在他正研究同航空、水利有关的“紊流理论”。在许多专家指导下，投入科学研究的青年教师越来越多，仅天津大学就有一百三十多名青年教师参加了科学研究工作。
    1956年天津市科学研究工作的一个特点是结合生产建设的研究题占了相当大的比重。植物生理学家崔澂为了使天津小站稻增产而研究出的既能节约水又能增加产量的灌溉方案，受到了中国科学院的重视。此外，关于防止化学溶液浸蚀机器、搪瓷工厂的自动化、在冬季施工中如何节约钢材和水泥等项研究，对解决生产实际问题都很有价值。天津大学教师关于短距离输电线路、焊条配方等的研究，受到了采用部门的欢迎。
    天津市医务界1956年共提出了四百多个研究题目。骨科专家方先之正在进行骨关节移植的研究。肿瘤科专家金显宅整理了乳腺癌扩大手术治疗等方面的经验。天津市一百多名中医师进行的五十项整理祖国医学遗产的研究中，已经有二十项初步肯定了治疗效果。
    随着科学研究活动的开展，天津市1956年建立了十八个工业、卫生等方面的科学研究机构。高等学校和医务界也扩充或新建了实验室，增加了仪器设备。
