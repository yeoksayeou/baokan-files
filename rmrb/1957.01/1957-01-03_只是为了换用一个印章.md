Just to Change a Seal...
    Zhang Ting
    I work in the Organization Department of the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee. In the past year, we have received many notices from various agencies across the country regarding the activation of new seals. In the past, only local agencies sent such notices, but now they are sent from all over the country. In the past year, we have received more than one hundred such notices from other places. Some were sent by provincial Party committee organization departments (such as the Jilin Provincial Party Committee Organization Department); some were sent by municipal Party committee organization departments (such as the Liuzhou Municipal Party Committee Organization Department); some were sent by prefectural Party committee organization departments (such as the Tianshui Prefectural Party Committee Organization Department); some were sent by county Party committee organization departments (such as the Lu'an County Party Committee Organization Department); some were sent by the working committees of organs (such as the Working Committee of Organs Directly Under the Shanxi Province); the Zhangjiakou Municipal Party Committee Organization Department even issued a collective notice for the replacement of seals by all district committees under its jurisdiction. Possibly due to the "demonstration" of higher-level organs and the influence of various localities, some grassroots Party committees are now doing the same, such as the Party Committee of Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 1 and the Party Committee of Xiangshan Pyrite Mine, which have also sent notices of the making of new seals. The most such notices were received in November, reaching 25, indicating that this matter has a growing trend.
    The content of such notices is roughly: "Our office will start using the new seal from a certain month, day, year, and the old seal will be invalidated on the same day. The design is attached for your reference," and so on. This short phrase indicates that its purpose is for "reference" and nothing else. How to "reference" it? Perhaps only the issuing unit knows. Because the leading comrades clearly do not have time to read this kind of notice, and even if ordinary comrades read it, they cannot look at it carefully, let alone remember it. Therefore, the only fate of this kind of notice is to be archived. Maybe some people will say that it should not be so neglected, but what can be done? No agency has a set of designs for the seals used by all agencies in the country, and no one can check the seal design after receiving documents from other agencies. Since this is the case, is there any need for those agencies that have changed their new seals to require other agencies to do so?
    Issuing this kind of notice, which is actually useless, causes a great waste of manpower and material resources. First, the documents must be sent to all parts of the country, in large quantities, averaging about four or five thousand copies, such as a notice issued by the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee Organization Department, which was printed in five thousand six hundred and twenty copies. Printing such a large number of notices not only requires a lot of office paper, but also requires the labor of many printing workers because most of these notices are printed in letterpress and are issued in the form of red and black overprinted official documents. After printing, several thousand envelopes are needed to send them out, and clerical staff have to register them, and they can only be delivered to various places after the busy work of messengers. After receiving them, various places have to open the envelopes and complete the registration procedures, and a simple reading also takes up a certain amount of working time. This is truly a waste of money and manpower.
    Therefore, I suggest that in the future, an agency should not do this kind of stupid thing when changing to a new seal. Even if it is to be issued, I think it is enough to send it to some units in this area and those that have more contact with you, why alarm the whole country! As for special circumstances (such as theft, etc.), it is indeed necessary to notify relevant units to pay attention to tracking, which is another matter, but this situation is, after all, very rare.

    只是为了换用一个印章……
    张挺
    我在中共旅大市委组织部工作。最近一年来，我们曾收到来自各地很多机关所发的启用新印章的通知。过去这类通知还只有本地的机关发来，现在全国各地都有送来的了。我们一年来收到的此类通知，就有一百余份是从外地发来的。有的是省委组织部发来的（如吉林省委组织部等）；有的是市委组织部发来的（如柳州市委组织部等）；有的是地委组织部发来的（如天水地委组织部等）；有的是县委组织部发来的（如六安县委组织部等）；有的是机关党委发来的（如山西省直属机关党委等）；张家口市委组织部甚至将所属各区委更换印章集中一起发个通知。可能由于上级机关的“示范”和各地的影响，目前有些基层党委也照样做了，如上海国棉一厂党委、向山硫铁矿党委等也发来了刻制新印章的通知。11月份接到的这类通知最多，竟达二十五件，可见，这件事有不断发展的趋势。
    这种通知的内容大致是：“我处自某年某月某日开始启用新印章，旧章同日作废，现将式样附后，请备查”等等。这篇短语说明其目的就是为了“备查”，别无他用。怎样“备查”呢？恐怕只有发文单位知道。因为这类通知显然领导同志是没有时间去看的，一般同志即使看，也不能细看，更不能把它记在心中，因此，这类通知唯一的命运是存档。也许有人会说不应该这样不重视，但又有什么办法呢？任何一个机关都没有一套全国所有机关使用印章的图样，而且谁也没有可能收到别的机关来的文件后先去核对印章样式。既然如此，那些换了新印章的机关有什么必要让别的机关一定要这样做呢？
    发这种实际上没有任何用处的通知，造成了很大的人力物力上的浪费。首先文件要发全国各地，数量很大，平均都在四、五千份左右，如南京市委组织部发来的一个通知印了五千六百二十份。印这样大量的通知，不仅需要很多办公用纸，而且由于这类通知绝大多数都是铅印的，又是用红黑色字的套版公文形式发的，需要不少印刷工人的劳动。印好后，还需要几千个信封向外发，文书处理人员要登记，经过交通员的奔忙才能送达到各地去。各地收到后，又要拆封履行登记手续，需要简单阅一下，也要占用一定的工作时间。这真是名副其实的劳民伤财。
    因此，我建议以后一个机关换用一个新印章不需要再做这种蠢事了。即是要发，我想发至本地区和自己联系较多的一些单位也就可以了，何必惊动全国！至于特殊情况下（如被盗窃等），确有必要通知有关单位注意追查者则是另外一回事，但这种情况毕竟是极少的。
