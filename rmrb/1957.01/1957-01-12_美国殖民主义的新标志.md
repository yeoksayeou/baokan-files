    The "Eisenhower Doctrine" has been released. Sober public opinion around the world unanimously points out that it is a remake of the "Truman Doctrine." Whether it is the "Eisenhower Doctrine" or the "Truman Doctrine," both are concrete manifestations of the "policy of strength" of the American ruling group in different periods. It is impossible for people to find any differences in their reactionary essence. However, the "Truman Doctrine" in 1947 only attempted to maintain the then reactionary governments of Greece and Turkey, and used these two Balkan countries as American military bases to threaten the People's Democracies of Eastern Europe and the Middle East; while the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in 1957 attempted to place the entire Middle East under American military protection and political control, making the region an exclusive sphere of influence for American monopoly capital. Therefore, the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is a more ambitious colonialist and aggressive plan than the "Truman Doctrine."
    It is precisely for this reason that Eisenhower's special message on January 5 and Dulles' statement on January 7 both attempted to use vicious words cursing "communism" and flowery words like "peace" and "freedom" to cover up the bloody colonialist and militarist essence of the "Eisenhower Doctrine." However, lies can never become truth, and slander is merely a manifestation of timidity and rascality.
    In which aspects does the aggressiveness and danger of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" manifest itself most prominently?
    The "Eisenhower Doctrine" is an open and direct challenge to the nationally independent countries and anti-colonialist forces in the Middle East region (including the vast areas of the entire West Asia and North Africa). The main struggle in the Middle East region at present is the struggle between the anti-colonialist forces centered on Arab countries and the Western colonial powers. The spearhead of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is mainly directed at countries and peoples in the region who demand to safeguard national independence and oppose colonialism. The so-called "international communism" in the vocabulary of the American ruling group is nothing more than a synonym for anti-colonialism and nationalism. If Eisenhower was still ambiguous in his message, Dulles was even more blatant in his statement.
    As everyone knows, the current situation in the Middle East countries is increasingly making the imperialists unable to sleep or eat. One situation is that in order to defend national independence and state sovereignty, they are willing to shed the last drop of blood and wage a resolute struggle against foreign aggressive forces. Another situation is the implementation of an independent and autonomous foreign policy, strengthening national unity, and continuing to eliminate colonialist forces. Still another situation is that participation in Western military blocs has politically isolated them, their economic difficulties have increased, and the people universally demand a change in the status quo. Dulles described these situations as "three dangers" of "international communism" appearing in several different forms; the United States must intervene and "counterattack" against the so-called "danger" in any of these situations, including the use of American armed forces. It can be seen that in 1954, the American ruling group still needed to force Latin American countries to pass a "Caracas Declaration" to recognize the legitimacy of its colonial rule over the Western Hemisphere, but today it believes that as long as the US Congress passes a piece of legislation, it has the right to occupy the entire Middle East and enslave the people of the Middle East. This explains why the "Eisenhower Doctrine" has aroused stronger protests and condemnation around the world than the "Truman Doctrine" and the "Caracas Declaration."
      The "Eisenhower Doctrine" is another blatant violation of the United Nations Charter by the United States. For several years, the United States has used the pretext that the United Nations Charter does not prohibit the exercise of individual and collective self-defense rights to conclude various military treaties with more than 40 countries and organize aggressive military blocs. Now, the United States further stated that it will use American armed forces to intervene in the Middle East situation whenever it deems it appropriate. The United Nations Charter has made clear provisions for resolving international disputes. The Security Council has the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. However, the formulators of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" believe that the United States can take military action and use force threats in the Middle East region alone without going through the United Nations. Eisenhower and Dulles have repeatedly argued that the United States does not intend to undermine the United Nations Charter and wants to be "in step" with the United Nations. However, everyone can see that the United States' use of force is not undertaking obligations to the United Nations, but requiring the Security Council to recognize the fait accompli created by American aggression. As the Egyptian News Agency said: "The Eisenhower Plan weakens the power of the United Nations and leads to a single country acting unilaterally according to its own plan." The United States' complete disregard for the United Nations Charter and openly declaring the use of American armed forces as a means of interfering in Middle Eastern affairs cannot but produce serious consequences.
    The "Eisenhower Doctrine" more blatantly condones various aggressive forces to carry out military adventures in the Middle East. Eisenhower said that he would "resist open armed aggression launched by any country controlled by international communism." Dulles seemed even more determined: "Armed communist attacks must be met by US armed forces." Of course, the so-called "armed aggression of international communism" or the so-called "armed communist attack" not only does not exist today, but will not happen tomorrow, not only does not exist within the Middle East region, but will not happen outside the Middle East region. What this region is currently encountering is: the allies of the United States—Britain and France—launched armed aggression against Egypt; the Israeli army fostered by the United States is still occupying the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip; Britain is attacking Yemen; France is massacring the Algerian people; and the Baghdad military bloc supported by the United States is increasingly seriously threatening the security of Syria and Jordan. What attitude will the United States take towards this ongoing and future armed attacks and threats of aggression? Sensitive Middle Eastern public opinion has raised sharp questions. Eisenhower and Dulles have not and dare not answer this question, because it is clear that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is certainly not to stop aggression against Middle Eastern countries, but only to intimidate Middle Eastern countries that have been selected as direct or indirect targets of aggression.
      The "Eisenhower Doctrine" is a new symbol of American colonialism, with anti-Soviet and anti-communist rhetoric as a guise, military threats as a means, economic "aid" as bait, and political control as the goal. It is a more dangerous enemy to the anti-colonialist struggle in the Middle East region and to the national independence and freedom of Middle Eastern countries. However, the people of the Middle East have suffered from the darkness of colonial rule for a long time, and they hate all forms of colonialism. They repelled British and French colonialism, certainly not to welcome the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The British and French ruling groups, who have suffered a complete defeat in their Middle East policy, seem to hope that the United States can consider the friendship of the Atlantic Alliance and the meaning of the "Tripartite Declaration" and not be too eager to fight each other. British Prime Minister Macmillan begged for the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to be unified with the Baghdad Pact. French Prime Minister Mollet begged that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" not include North Africa. However, among predatory imperialists, just like among greedy and insatiable beasts, there will never be any result in talking about benevolence and compassion. Replacing the position of Britain and France in the Middle East, turning the Mediterranean into the inner lake of the US Sixth Fleet, and making the entire African continent an American "economic arsenal"... The "Eisenhower Doctrine" is merely the beginning of a new stage in the development of the conflict of interests between imperialist countries in this region.
    After the failure of the British and French aggression against Egypt, the United States stepped up its efforts to create a "Cold War" center in the Middle East to prevent the situation in the region from easing. The announcement of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" not only shows that the United States is moving to the "edge of war" in the Middle East, but also shows that the United States is determined to continue the "Cold War" between the East and the West and maintain international tension. In his State of the Union address on the 10th, Eisenhower once again emphasized the policy of military threats to strengthen "military alliances," "military strength," and "military assistance." However, contrary to the subjective wishes of the American ruling group, facts will increasingly powerfully prove that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" cannot fulfill the colonialist "cause" of the United States in the Middle East, and cannot save the fate of the bankruptcy of the "policy of strength."

    美国殖民主义的新标志
    “艾森豪威尔主义”出笼了。全世界清醒的舆论一致指出，它是“杜鲁门主义”的翻版。不论是“艾森豪威尔主义”，或者是“杜鲁门主义”，都是美国统治集团的“实力政策”在不同时期的具体表现。人们不可能从它们之间的反动本质上找出任何不同之点。但是，1947年的“杜鲁门主义”还只是企图维持希腊和土耳其当时的反动政府，并把这两个巴尔干国家作为美国威胁东欧人民民主国家和中东国家的军事基地；而1957年的“艾森豪威尔主义”，却企图把整个中东地区置于美国的军事保护和政治控制之下，使这个地区成为美国垄断资本独占的势力范围。因此，“艾森豪威尔主义”是比“杜鲁门主义”更加野心勃勃的殖民侵略计划。
    正是因为这个缘故，艾森豪威尔1月5日的特别咨文和杜勒斯1月7日的声明，都企图用诅咒“共产主义”的恶毒字眼和“和平”、“自由”这些花言巧语，来掩盖“艾森豪威尔主义”的血腥的殖民主义和黩武主义的实质。但是，谎言从来不能变成真理，污蔑只是怯弱和无赖的表现。
    “艾森豪威尔主义”的侵略性和危险性究竟在哪些方面表现得最为突出呢？
    “艾森豪威尔主义”是对中东地区的（包括整个西亚和北非的广大地区）民族独立国家和反殖民主义势力的公开的、直接的挑战。目前中东地区的主要斗争，是以阿拉伯国家为中心的反殖民主义势力同西方殖民国家之间的斗争。“艾森豪威尔主义”的锋芒主要是指向在这个地区内要求维护民族独立和反对殖民主义的国家和人民。所谓“国际共产主义”，在美国统治集团的词汇中，不过是反殖民主义和民族主义的同义语。如果说，艾森豪威尔在他的咨文中还含混其词的话，那么，杜勒斯在他的声明中就说得更加露骨了。
    大家知道，目前在中东国家中发生的情况，越来越使帝国主义者寝食不安。为了捍卫民族独立和国家主权，不惜流出最后一滴血，同外来的侵略势力作坚决的斗争，这是一种情况。执行独立自主的外交政策，加强民族团结，继续清除殖民主义势力，这是另一种情况。因参加西方军事集团而使自己在政治上陷于孤立，在经济上困难日增，人民普遍要求改变现状，这又是一种情况。杜勒斯把这些情况说成是“国际共产主义”以几种不同形式出现的“三种危险”；对于不论是任何一种情况的所谓“危险”，美国都要进行干涉，加以“反击”，包括使用美国武装部队的手段在内。可见美国统治集团在1954年还需要强使拉丁美洲国家通过一项“加斯加拉宣言”来承认它对西半球实行殖民统治的合法性，而今天它却认为只要美国国会通过一项立法，就有权霸占整个中东地区、奴役中东各国人民了。这说明“艾森豪威尔主义”为什么在全世界引起比“杜鲁门主义”和“加拉加斯宣言”更为强烈的抗议和谴责。
      “艾森豪威尔主义”是美国对联合国宪章的又一次粗暴的破坏。几年以来，美国借口联合国宪章不禁止行使单独的和集体的自卫权利，同四十多个国家缔结各种军事条约，组织侵略性的军事集团。现在，美国进一步表示在任何它认为是适当的时候，将使用美国武装部队干涉中东局势。联合国宪章对解决国际争端作了明确的规定。安全理事会负有维持国际和平和安全的首要责任。但是，“艾森豪威尔主义”的制定者却认为美国在中东地区可以单独采取军事行动，进行武力威胁，而不必通过联合国。艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯都一再辩解，美国并不打算破坏联合国宪章，要同联合国“步调一致”。但是，人人都可以看出，美国使用武力并不是对联合国承担义务，而是要求安全理事会承认美国的侵略行动所造成的既成事实。正如埃及的消息报所说：“艾森豪威尔计划是削弱联合国的权力，导致单独一国按照它自己的计划，片面地行事。”美国完全蔑视联合国宪章，公然宣布以美国武装部队作为干预中东事务的手段，不能不产生严重的后果。
    “艾森豪威尔主义”更明目张胆地纵容各种侵略势力在中东进行军事冒险行动。艾森豪威尔说要“抵抗由国际共产主义所控制的任何国家发动的公开的武装侵略”。杜勒斯似乎更加坚决了：“武装的共产党进攻必须受到美国武装部队的迎击”。当然，所谓“国际共产主义的武装侵略”或者是所谓“武装的共产党进攻”，不仅今天不存在，明天也不会发生，不仅在中东地区以内不存在，在中东地区以外也不会发生。目前这个地区的遭遇是：美国的同盟者——英国和法国对埃及进行了武装侵略；美国扶植起来的以色列军队仍然占领着西奈半岛和加沙地带；英国在进攻也门；法国在屠杀阿尔及利亚人民；美国支持的巴格达军事集团日益严重地威胁着叙利亚和约旦的安全。对于这种正在发生着的和今后将继续发生的武装进攻和侵略威胁，美国将采取什么态度呢？敏感的中东各国舆论纷纷提出了尖锐的质问。艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯都没有、也不敢答复这个问题，因为很明显，“艾森豪威尔主义”当然不是为了制止对中东国家的侵略，而只是为了恫吓被选择为直接或间接的侵略对象的中东国家。
      “艾森豪威尔主义”是以反苏反共为幌子、以武力威胁为手段、以经济“援助”为诱饵、以政治控制为目的的美国殖民主义的新标志。对于中东地区的反殖民主义斗争，对于中东国家的民族独立和自由，它是一个更加危险的敌人。但是，中东人民曾长时期受到黑暗的殖民统治的苦难，他们痛恨殖民主义的一切表现形式。他们击退英法殖民主义，决不是为了欢迎“艾森豪威尔主义”。在中东政策上身败名裂的英法统治集团似乎希望美国能念大西洋联盟之谊，顾“三国宣言”之义，不要相煎太急。英国首相麦克米伦乞求“艾森豪威尔主义”同巴格达条约统一起来。法国总理摩勒乞求“艾森豪威尔主义”不包括北非在内。但是，在掠夺成性的帝国主义者之间，好像在贪婪无厌的野兽之间一样，要讲仁义和慈悲是从来不会有什么结果的。代替英法在中东的地位、把地中海变成美国第六舰队的内湖，使整个非洲大陆成为美国的“经济兵工厂”……“艾森豪威尔主义”仅仅是帝国主义国家在这个地区的利害冲突发展到一个新阶段的开始。
    英法对埃及的侵略战争失败后，美国加紧在中东造成一个“冷战”的中心，以阻挠这个地区的局势趋向和缓。“艾森豪威尔主义”的宣布，不仅表明美国在中东走向“战争边缘”，而且表明美国决心在东西方继续进行“冷战”，保持国际紧张局势。艾森豪威尔在10日发表的国情咨文中，再度强调要加强“军事联盟”、“军事实力”、“军事援助”的武力威胁政策。但是，跟美国统治集团的主观愿望相反，事实将日益有力地证明：“艾森豪威尔主义”不能成全美国在中东的殖民主义“事业”，不能挽救“实力政策”破产的命运。
