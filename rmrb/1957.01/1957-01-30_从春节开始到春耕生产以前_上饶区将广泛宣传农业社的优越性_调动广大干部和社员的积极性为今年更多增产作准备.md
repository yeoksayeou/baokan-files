(Our newspaper, Nanchang, January 29th dispatch) The Communist Party organizations at all levels in the Shangrao District of Jiangxi Province will mobilize the entire Party to widely publicize the superiority of agricultural cooperatives to farmers from the Spring Festival to before spring ploughing production. They will launch a self-ideological education movement for cadres and the masses to further enhance the enthusiasm of cadres and members, inspect and promote the spring ploughing preparation work in this area, and organize a high tide of spring ploughing production.

In late January, the sixteen CCP county committees in the Shangrao area all held several days of plenary meetings to summarize the work of running cooperatives over the past year, summarize the superiority of cooperatives, affirm achievements, and draw lessons and accept teachings from them. At the same time, they prepared and wrote materials for reporting to farmers. Report teams have been formed in each county, and the county party secretaries and propaganda ministers directly lead the activities of the report teams and give them demonstration reports. Some counties have also organized propaganda brigades and propaganda groups at the district and township levels. Thousands of county and district cadres (including some county committee members) throughout the district responded to the call of the CCP Shangrao Prefectural Committee to report on rural issues and current affairs policies to their relatives and friends when they went home for the Spring Festival, and widely solicit their opinions and requests. Now, in counties such as Leping, Wannian, and Poyang, which are acting earlier, tens of thousands of propagandists and staff members are conducting reports and propaganda activities in every corner every day. Large-scale agricultural cooperation and agricultural production exhibitions held in Wannian, Leping and other counties have also begun to be exhibited to farmers and are very popular.

More than 99% of farmers in the Shangrao area have joined 2,276 advanced cooperatives. These more than 2,000 cooperatives, after a year of efforts, have shown great superiority. Last year's production increased by 11.34% compared to the previous year, becoming an unprecedented year of bumper harvest. However, there are also some problems and shortcomings in the course of progress. The Shangrao Prefectural Committee believes that in order to make more than 2,000 cooperatives more consolidated this year and comprehensively complete this year's production increase plan, it is first necessary to further mobilize the positive factors of the vast number of rural cadres and members.

In order to ensure that the publicity of the superiority of cooperatives can improve the enthusiasm of cadres and promote current production, all localities will also launch a self-ideological education movement among all cadres and members on the basis of universal publicity. During this period, each cooperative will use methods such as accounting comparisons and mobilizing members to summarize the work of the cooperative over the past year to conduct concrete and in-depth publicity and education on the superiority of the cooperative. At the same time, a general movement to evaluate and reward model cadres and model members (including model collectives) will also be launched among all cadres and members. Cadres who have done well in their work, study, production, and contact with the masses, and who have led members to successfully complete the production tasks of their groups, teams, and cooperatives, and members who have made special contributions to maintaining collective interests, actively working, creating inventions in production technology, and protecting public property and saving expenses, will be evaluated by the masses as model cadres and model members. After the evaluation, each cooperative will hold a awards conference to set an example, educate the whole body, and lay an ideological foundation for spring ploughing production. At the same time, a major inspection of spring ploughing preparation work will be launched to organize a high tide of spring ploughing production.

    从春节开始到春耕生产以前
    上饶区将广泛宣传农业社的优越性
    调动广大干部和社员的积极性为今年更多增产作准备
    本报南昌29日电　江西省上饶专区中共各级组织将动员全党力量，在春节到春耕生产以前，向农民广泛地进行农业合作社优越性的宣传，开展干部群众自我思想教育运动，来进一步提高广大干部和社员群众的积极性，检查、推动这个地区的春耕准备工作和组织春耕生产高潮。
    1月下旬，上饶地区的十六个中共县委会都召开了几天的全体会议，总结一年来的办社工作，总结合作社的优越性，肯定成绩，从中吸取经验、接受教训。同时，准备和编写向农民作报告的材料。各县的报告团已经组成，县委书记和宣传部长直接领导报告团的活动并向他们作示范报告。有些县还在区乡二级组织了宣传大队和宣传小组。全区数千名县、区干部（包括一部分县委委员在内），都响应中共上饶地委的号召，回家过春节的时候向亲友们进行农村问题和时事政策的报告，广泛征求他们的意见和要求。现在，行动得比较早的乐平、万年、鄱阳等县，每天都有上万的宣传员和工作人员在各个角落进行报告和宣传活动。万年、乐平等县举办的大型的农业合作化和农业生产展览会，也已向农民开始展出，深受农民的欢迎。
    上饶地区99％以上的农户，都分别参加到二千二百七十六个高级社中。这二千多个合作社，经过一年来的努力，显示了巨大的优越性。去年比前年增产11.34％，成为历史上的空前丰收年。但在前进当中，也存在着一些问题和缺点。上饶地委认为，要使二千多个社在今年更加巩固和全面地完成今年增产计划，首先必须进一步调动广大农村干部和社员群众的积极因素。
    为了使这次合作社优越性的宣传能够提高干部的积极性，并推动当前生产，各地还将在普遍宣传的基础上，在全体干部和社员群众中开展自我思想教育运动。在这个期间，各个合作社都将通过算账对比和发动社员总结合作社一年来的工作等办法，具体地深入地进行合作社优越性的宣传教育。同时，还要在全体干部和社员中间开展一次普遍的评选和奖励模范干部和模范社员（包括模范集体）的运动。凡是工作好、学习好、生产好、联系群众好因而领导社员出色地完成了本组、本队、本社的生产任务的干部和凡是在维护集体利益、积极劳动、在生产技术上有创造发明、对于保护公共财物和节约开支有特殊贡献的社员，都将通过群众评定为模范干部和模范社员。评选以后，各社都要举行奖励大会，以树立榜样，教育全体，为春耕生产打下思想基础。同时，还要发动一个春耕准备工作大检查，组织春耕生产高潮。
