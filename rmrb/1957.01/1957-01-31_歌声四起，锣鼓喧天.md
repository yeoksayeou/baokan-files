    Jiangsu Province's 48,000-plus rural clubs are preparing to ensure that singing is everywhere and drums and gongs fill the air during the Spring Festival, based on the principles of spending no money or spending very little.

    Since December of last year, various counties in Jiangsu Province have trained a large number of rural cultural and entertainment personnel. Rural clubs in Yixing, Wujin, and other places will hold New Year's Eve parties, worker-peasant-intellectual get-togethers, New Year tea houses, lectures, and other events during the Spring Festival, aiming to achieve performances in every township, celebrations in every cooperative, activities in every department (club), and propaganda everywhere. In Xianhe Agricultural Cooperative of Pingdeng Township, Hai'an County, which achieved a bumper harvest in the first year after entering advanced cooperative, the members sold the fish caught while irrigating and accumulating fertilizer to use as funds for Spring Festival cultural and recreational activities. The members are all jubilant, catching fish in the ditch during the day and rehearsing plays at the club in the evening. The Zhanxian Township Central Club in Haimen County is rehearsing self-composed small operas by farmers such as "Love the Cooperative Like Home" and "Three Poor Peasant Households Persist in Running the Cooperative."

    歌声四起，锣鼓喧天
    江苏省四万八千多个农村俱乐部准备在不花钱和少花钱的原则下，做到春节歌声四起，锣鼓喧天。
    江苏省各县自去年12月份起集训了大批农村文娱骨干。宜兴、武进等地的农村俱乐部春节将举行除夕晚会、工农知识分子联欢会、新年茶社、讲座等，要做到乡乡搞公演，社社有联欢，部部（俱乐部）有活动，处处有宣传。在进入高级合作社后第一年获得了丰收的海安县平等乡鲜河农业社里，社员们把车水积肥时捕到的鱼卖掉，作为春节文娱活动经费。社员们个个欢欣鼓舞，白天在沟里捕鱼，晚上去俱乐部排戏。海门县占先乡中心俱乐部正在排演农民自编的小演唱“爱社如家”和“三户贫农坚持办社”等节目。　（新华社）
