Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 10th: Dong Biwu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, met with 1,700 young people from all walks of life in Hubei Province and Wuhan City in the auditorium of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee on the 9th, and gave instructions on carrying forward the revolutionary tradition of hard work and plain living.

Dong Biwu said that the Chinese Communist Party has always been concerned about young people. When preparing to establish the Party in 1921, it was also preparing to establish a core youth organization. The Party not only organized the youth, but also educated them with the correct method of Marxism-Leninism to understand and solve problems, cultivated the youth, and brought into play the role of the youth. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can young people truly gain freedom and fully contribute their strength to the motherland.

Dong Biwu then pointed out that we still have many difficulties in the process of building socialism, including long-term difficulties and immediate difficulties. This requires young people to step forward to shoulder difficult tasks and overcome difficulties. When we encounter things, we must not only think of the favorable and good aspects, but also estimate the worst and most difficult situations. Dong Biwu also told the story of the Red Army's passage through the snowy mountains and grasslands during the Long March. He said that at that time, it was not only difficult to walk, but also difficult to sleep. Everything was wet, so we had to stay on the shrubs. What was even more difficult was that there was no food to eat and no firewood to burn. But we overcame these difficulties. He also talked about how we used land reclamation and production to overcome difficulties during the War of Resistance Against Japan. He said that in Yan'an, although we had to wear a set of cotton clothes for several years, wearing them through the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, we also overcame it victoriously. Working in the Kuomintang-controlled areas was not only full of difficulties, but also risked being beheaded, but we were not intimidated and completed the revolutionary tasks. He encouraged the young people to inherit and carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition, learn the selfless spirit of heroes such as Liu Hulan, Wu Yunduo, and Huang Jiguang, and strive to complete the construction cause of the motherland.

Dong Biwu finally said that the Youth League members should set an example everywhere. Hubei Province has 700,000 League members and 5 million young people. The proportion of League members among young people is very large. As long as the League members can play an exemplary role in their work, the difficulties in the work can be overcome, and victory will surely belong to us.

At the meeting, Dong Biwu also accepted gifts presented by young people from all walks of life on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

    董必武向湖北青年作报告
    对比过去和现在，号召继承和发扬革命光荣传统建设祖国
    新华社武汉10日电　中共中央政治局委员董必武，9日在中共湖北省委礼堂同湖北省和武汉市的各界青年一千七百多人见面，并且就发扬艰苦朴素的革命传统问题作了指示。
    董必武说，中国共产党一向是关心青年的。1921年准备建立党的时候，就准备建立青年的核心组织。党不仅把青年组织起来了，并且教育他们以马克思列宁主义的正确方法来认识和解决问题，培养了青年，发挥了青年的作用。青年只有在共产党的领导下，才真正获得了自由，能够充分地为祖国贡献出自己的力量。
    董必武接着指出，我们在建设社会主义过程中还有许多困难，有长时期的困难，也有眼前的困难，这就要求青年挺身出来担负困难的任务，克服困难。我们遇事不仅要想到有利的好的方面，还要估计到最坏的最困难的情况。董必武还讲述了过去在长征时红军走过雪山草地的故事。他说，那时不但走路困难，睡觉也困难，到处都是湿的，只好宿在灌木上；更困难的是没有饭吃，没有柴烧。但这些困难我们也克服过来了。他还谈到了抗日战争时怎样用开荒生产战胜困难的情形。他说，在延安时，虽然我们一套棉衣要穿好几年，要穿着它渡过春夏秋冬四个季节，但是我们也胜利地过来了。在蒋介石统治区进行工作，不仅困难重重，还要冒着杀头的危险，可是我们没有被吓倒，完成了革命任务。他鼓励青年们继承和发扬革命的光荣传统，学习刘胡兰、吴运铎、黄继光等英雄的忘我的精神，为完成祖国的建设事业而奋斗。
    董必武最后说，青年团员要处处作表率。湖北省有七十万团员，有五百万青年，青年团员在青年中的比例数字很大，只要团员能在工作中发挥模范带头作用，工作中的困难是能够克服的，胜利一定是属于我们的。
    会上，董必武还代表中共中央接受了各界青年献给的礼品。
