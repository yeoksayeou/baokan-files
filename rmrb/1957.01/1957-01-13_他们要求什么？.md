    What Do They Demand?
    Zhu Shihe
    Cadres of the Communist Youth League Committee of the Harbin Institute of Forestry once asked the Dean of Studies for the opportunity to audit a course on Marxism-Leninism. This Dean of Studies, a member of the Party Committee, simply replied, "Cadre study issues are the responsibility of the Party Committee Propaganda Department." Finding the head of the Propaganda Department, they received the reply, "I don't handle that, go find the Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee!" The Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, however, said, "That's the President's business, I can't manage it!"
    The study problem of the full-time cadres of the Communist Youth League at the Harbin Institute of Forestry is like a football, kicked back and forth. Unfortunately, such examples of not supporting the study of League cadres are not isolated in institutions of higher learning. The activity time of League cadres in schools is mostly concentrated in students' free time, so their studies and some private matters can only be arranged outside this time. However, some administrative leaders of institutions of higher learning insist that League cadres work the same hours as administrative staff; and during office hours, they are not allowed to read books and newspapers, otherwise it is said to be "violating labor discipline." In this way, the working hours of League cadres are actually extended, affecting their studies and health.
    It doesn't stop there; some Party Committees and administrative leaders in institutions of higher learning also assign many administrative tasks to the League Committee. For example, if students at the Nanjing Institute of Technology want to borrow a classroom from the school to hold a meeting, or if the light bulb in a student dormitory is broken or a window is smashed, the League Committee is responsible for solving it. The Party Committee of Shandong Normal College even asks League Committee cadres to duplicate and bind documents. Many institutions of higher learning assign the League Committee to take full responsibility for tasks such as assessing people's scholarships, selecting outstanding students, hosting middle school students for visits, and assessing grain supply quotas. As a result, some students at these schools call the League Committee the "Second General Affairs Department"!
    The main task of the League organization in institutions of higher learning is to assist the Party in doing a good job in the political and ideological education of young people. Therefore, the Party Committee should work hard to improve their level and try to free them from unnecessary administrative tasks. As long as the school leadership attaches importance to the education and training of League cadres, it is not impossible to solve. Tsinghua University has done a relatively good job in this regard. They stipulate that each full-time League cadre must take one or two courses on Marxism-Leninism, and can audit professional courses according to their own wishes, with two hours each morning available for study.
    It should also be explained that the vast majority of students in institutions of higher learning are young people, so it is entirely correct in general institutions of higher learning to mainly entrust the League Committee with work related to students. However, to have the League Committee take on all administrative tasks related to students, and to use full-time League cadres as administrative staff, will inevitably weaken the Communist Youth League's fighting role in carrying out communist education among young people, which I think should be corrected.

    他们要求什么？
    朱世和
    青年团哈尔滨林学院委员会的干部，有一次向教务处长请示，希望能得到旁听一门马列主义课程的机会。这位处长是党委委员，仅回答：“干部学习问题，由党委宣传部负责。”找到宣传部长，答复：“我不管，你去找党委副书记吧！”党委副书记却说：“这是院长的事，我管不了！”
    哈尔滨林学院团的专职干部的学习问题，就好像一个皮球一样，被人踢来踢去。遗憾的是像这样不支持团干部学习的例子，在高等学校里还不是个别的。学校团的干部活动时间，大部集中在学生的自由活动时间，因而他们的学习和一些私人事情，只有安排在这个时间以外。但是有些高等学校的行政领导同志，却硬要团的干部和行政人员一起上下班；而在办公的时间内，却又不允许他们阅读书报，否则就说是“违犯劳动纪律”。这样，就实际上延长了团的干部的工作时间，影响了他们的学习和身体的健康。
    还不止此，有些高等学校的党委和行政领导上，把许多行政事务工作也交给团委来做。比如南京工学院的学生向校方借教室开会，学生宿舍的灯泡坏了，打破了玻璃，都要由团委负责解决。山东师范学院的党委，连复写和装订文件也要找团委干部。许多高等学校，把评定人民助学金、评选优秀生、招待中学生参观、评定粮食供应定额等工作，都交给团委包干。因而有的学校的学生，把团委会称做“第二总务科”！
    高等学校中团组织的主要任务，是协助党做好青年群众的政治思想教育工作，因而党委应该努力来提高他们的水平，并且设法把他们从不必要的行政事务工作中解放出来。关于团干部的教育和培养，只要学校的领导上重视起来，并不是不能解决的。清华大学在这方面作得就比较好。他们规定每个团的脱产干部都选修一门至两门马列主义课程，并根据本人志愿旁听专业课程，学习时间每天上午可抽出两个小时。
    还应该说明，高等学校的绝大部分学生都是青年，因而在一般高等学校中，把有关学生的工作主要委托给团委负责，是完全正确的。但是，要团委包揽有关学生的行政事务工作，把团的专职干部当作行政事务干部使用，就必然削弱青年团向青年进行共产主义教育的战斗作用，我以为是应该纠正的。
