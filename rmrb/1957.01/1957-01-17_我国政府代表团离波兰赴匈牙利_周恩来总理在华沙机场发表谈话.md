Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 16th: The government delegation of the People's Republic of China, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, left Warsaw by plane at 10:30 this morning for Budapest.

    Dozens of five-star red flags and Polish national flags, as well as banners in Chinese and Polish reading "Long Live the Brotherly Friendship Between the Chinese and Polish Peoples!" and "Long Live the People's Republic of China!", fluttered at the airport.

    Polish United Workers' Party and government leaders Gomulka, Zawadzki, Cyrankiewicz, Ochab, Foreign Minister Rapacki, Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers Nowak, Speaker of the Polish Parliament Dambowski, and others went to the airport to see them off.

    Diplomatic envoys of various countries stationed in Poland and Chinese Ambassador to Poland Wang Bingnan also went to the airport to see them off.

    After the bands played the national anthems of China and Poland, Premier Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz, reviewed the guard of honor. Subsequently, Premier Zhou Enlai shook hands with representatives of all sectors of the Polish people and members of the diplomatic corps stationed in Poland, and delivered a speech to those seeing him off.

    Chairman Cyrankiewicz delivered a farewell speech.

    As Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long boarded the plane, they shook hands tightly with comrades Gomulka and others. Gomulka said to Zhou Enlai, "I wish you a safe journey, and please give my regards to Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Liu Shaoqi." Comrade Zawadzki asked Marshal He Long to convey his respects to Marshal Zhu De.

    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 16th: The full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the Warsaw Airport is as follows: Respected Comrade Gomulka, Respected Comrade Zawadzki, Respected Comrade Cyrankiewicz, Respected Comrades and Friends:

    We are about to conclude our visit to the People's Republic of Poland. After five days of joyful gathering, we are now saying goodbye to the Polish people. During our five-day visit to your country, we held talks with the leaders of the Polish state and exchanged views on the current international situation and many issues of common concern to our two countries. These views have been expressed in the joint statement signed this morning. I am deeply convinced that the outcome of our talks will help strengthen the cause of peace and socialism.

    People's Poland has left us with a profound and unforgettable impression. During our visits to Warsaw, Krakow, Wroclaw, and Lodz, we saw your beautiful and rich land, and also saw your warm and wise people. We saw the ancient and excellent culture you created in history, and also saw the new socialist life you are creating. We have seen that, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Polish working class and the Polish people have made tremendous achievements in building socialism in the past twelve years. Although some mistakes have been made in the past, which have left some difficulties for today, these mistakes are being corrected. We have no doubt that the Polish working class and the Polish people, firmly united around the Polish United Workers' Party, will surely be able to overcome all temporary difficulties and greatly advance the socialist cause in Poland.

    We came with the friendship and goodwill of 600 million Chinese people, and with the determination and desire of the Chinese people to further consolidate the unity between socialist countries. In Poland, we have seen the same friendship and goodwill, the same determination and desire everywhere. As we leave, we have deepened our confidence that the development of friendship and unity between us cannot be stopped by any force.

    On the eve of our departure, I would like to once again express our heartfelt thanks to the Polish government and people for the warm reception they have given us. Although our visit was short, the brotherly affection that the Polish people showed us everywhere, which flowed naturally from their hearts, deeply moved each of us. We promise to bring it back and convey it to the Chinese people.

    Finally, I wish:

    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Polish peoples!

    Long live the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union!

    Long live the unity of all peace-loving forces in the world!

    Long live peace and socialism!

    我国政府代表团离波兰赴匈牙利
    周恩来总理在华沙机场发表谈话
    新华社华沙16日电　以周恩来总理为首的中华人民共和国政府代表团在今日上午十时半乘飞机离开华沙飞往布达佩斯。
    机场上飘扬着数十面五星红旗和波兰国旗以及用中文和波文写的“中波两国人民兄弟般的友谊万岁！”和“中华人民共和国万岁！”等标语。
    波兰统一工人党和政府的领导人哥穆尔卡、萨瓦茨基、西伦凯维兹、奥哈布，外交部长拉帕茨基，部长会议副主席诺瓦克，波兰议会议长邓博夫斯基等都到机场送行。
    各国驻波兰的外交使节和中国驻波兰大使王炳南也到机场送别。
    乐队奏过中波两国国歌之后，周恩来总理由波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹陪同检阅了仪仗队。随后，周恩来总理同波兰各界人民代表和各国驻波兰外交使团人员一一握手，并向送行者发表了演说。
    西伦凯维兹主席致送别词。
    周恩来总理和贺龙副总理在走上飞机时，又同哥穆尔卡等同志紧紧握手。哥穆尔卡对周恩来说，“祝你一路平安，请你向毛泽东同志和刘少奇同志等问好。”萨瓦茨基同志请贺龙元帅向朱德元帅转致敬意。
    新华社华沙16日电　周恩来总理在华沙机场上的讲话。全文如下：敬爱的哥穆尔卡同志：敬爱的萨瓦茨基同志：敬爱的西伦凯维兹同志：敬爱的同志们，朋友们：
    我们就要结束在波兰人民共和国的访问了。在五天的欢聚之后，我们现在要同波兰人民告别了。在我们访问你们国家的五天中，我们曾经同波兰国家的领导人进行了会谈，就当前国际形势和我们两国共同关心的许多问题交换了意见。这些意见已经表达在今天早晨签字的联合声明中。我深信，我们会谈的结果定将有助于加强和平和社会主义的事业。
    人民波兰已经给我们留下了深刻难忘的印象。在到华沙、克拉科夫、弗罗茨瓦夫和罗兹的访问中，我们看到了你们美丽富饶的土地，也看到了你们热情智慧的人民。我们看到了你们在历史上创造的古老优秀的文化，也看到了你们正在创造着的社会主义的新生活。我们看到，在波兰统一工人党的领导下，波兰工人阶级和波兰人民在过去十二年中，在建设社会主义方面取得了巨大的成就。虽然在过去的工作中也产生了一些错误，因而给今天留下了一些困难，但是这些错误正在得到纠正。我们毫不怀疑，坚定地团结在波兰统一工人党周围的波兰工人阶级和波兰人民一定能够克服一切暂时的困难而把波兰的社会主义事业大大地推向前进。
    我们是带着六万万中国人民的友谊和善意来的，是带着中国人民对进一步巩固社会主义国家之间的团结的决心和愿望来的。在波兰，我们到处都看到了同样的友谊和善意，同样的决心和愿望。在我们离开的时候，我们加深了这样的信心：我们之间的友谊和团结的发展是没有任何力量可以阻止的。
    在临别的时候，我要再一次对波兰政府和人民所给予我们热烈的接待表示衷心的感谢。我们访问的时间虽然很短，但是所到之处，波兰人民向我们表示的、从心底自然流露出来的兄弟之情使我们每一个人都深深感动，我们保证一定要把它带回去，转达给中国人民。
    最后，我祝：
    中波两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义国家的团结万岁！
    世界上一切爱好和平的力量的团结万岁！
    和平和社会主义万岁！
