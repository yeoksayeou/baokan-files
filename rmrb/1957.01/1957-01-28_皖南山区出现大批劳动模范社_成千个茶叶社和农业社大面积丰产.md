Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 25th – Since the realization of agricultural cooperativization, thousands of tea production cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives in the southern Anhui mountain region have achieved large-scale bumper harvests. They were recently评为 awarded the title of first- and second-class model labor cooperatives at agricultural labor model conferences held in various counties.

The Guanghui Tea Production Cooperative in Qimen County, with one hundred and twenty mu of tea gardens, produced an average of 194.5 jin of tea per mu last year. The cooperative's tea production increased by 99% compared to 1955, and all members increased their income. The Changtan Tea Production Cooperative in She County, near Huangshan, is a famous model tea production cooperative in the province. This cooperative has maintained the province's record for large-scale, high-yield tea production for three consecutive years. Last year, the cooperative's 1,247 mu of tea gardens produced an average of 153.13 jin of tea per mu, an increase of 55.45% compared to 1955. Among them, 60 mu produced an average of 259 jin of tea per mu, more than twice the local average yield.

The Xinghuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yi County, located deep in the mountains, promoted agricultural production technology reforms, resulting in an average yield of 751.14 jin of grain crops per mu, an increase of 80.9% compared to 1955. The Zifubu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiuning County switched to planting double-cropping rice last year, turning 1,001 mu of land into "thousand-jin mu."

Before the realization of agricultural cooperativization in the southern Anhui mountain region, farmers were too busy due to the conflict in production seasons between tea and grain, so the growth rate of both tea and grain was not very fast. After the establishment of cooperatives last year, labor could be uniformly dispatched, and advanced production technologies could be widely promoted. As a result, tea production increased by more than 20%, exceeding the annual increase since liberation, and the unit area yield of grain also increased.

    皖南山区出现大批劳动模范社
    成千个茶叶社和农业社大面积丰产
    新华社合肥25日电　实现农业合作化以后的安徽省皖南山区，有成千个大面积丰产的茶叶生产合作社和农业生产合作社，在最近各县召开的农业劳动模范会议上被评为一、二等劳动模范社。
    祁门县光辉茶叶生产合作社一百二十亩茶园，去年平均每亩产茶叶一百九十四点五斤。全社茶叶比1955年增产了99％，所有的社员都增加了收入。靠近黄山的歙县长潭茶叶生产合作社，是全省著名的茶叶生产模范社。这个社连续三年保持了全省茶叶大面积高额丰产纪录。去年全社一千二百四十七亩茶园平均每亩产茶叶一百五十三点一三斤，比1955年提高了55.45％。其中有六十亩平均每亩产茶叶两百五十九斤，比当地一般产量高出一倍多。
    处在深山中的黟县星火农业生产合作社，由于推行农业生产技术改革，粮食作物平均每亩收七百五十一点一四斤，比1955年提高了80.9％。休宁县紫阜农业生产合作社去年改种双季稻，使一千零一亩田成了“千斤亩”。
    皖南山区在没有实现农业合作化以前，因为茶叶和粮食在生产季节上有冲突，农民们忙不开，所以茶叶和粮食的增产速度都不很快。去年办起合作社以后，劳动力能够统一调度，先进生产技术能够广泛推广，因此茶叶增产了两成多，超过了解放后每年的增产幅度，粮食的单位面积产量也提高了。
