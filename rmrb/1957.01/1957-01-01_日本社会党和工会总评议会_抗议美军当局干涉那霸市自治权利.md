Xinhua News Agency, December 30th – The Japanese Socialist Party and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan today strongly opposed the U.S. military authorities in Okinawa interfering with the appointment of Kamejiro Senaga, Secretary-General of the Okinawa People's Party, as Mayor of Naha.

    The protest letter from the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan has been delivered to General Ranneziel, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Command.

    Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Japanese Socialist Party, suggested to Japanese Prime Minister Tanzan Ishibashi that the Japanese government should begin negotiations with the U.S. government to prevent the U.S. military authorities in Okinawa from interfering in Naha City's autonomy.

    The U.S. military authorities in Okinawa are intensifying their interference activities in an attempt to prevent Senaga from taking office on January 5th next year.
