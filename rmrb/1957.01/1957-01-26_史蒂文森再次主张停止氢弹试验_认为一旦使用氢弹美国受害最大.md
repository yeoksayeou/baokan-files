Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 25th. TASS reports: Former Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson, in an article to be published in the American magazine "Look" on February 5th, once again advocated that the United States sign an international agreement banning hydrogen bomb tests.

The author said that before and during last year's U.S. presidential campaign, he suggested that the U.S. take the initiative to seek an agreement banning such tests. However, this suggestion was "virtually ignored by the White House" and was vehemently attacked by Nixon, Dewey, and other Republican officials.

Stevenson said that he believes that if hydrogen bombs were used, the United States would suffer greater losses than any other country. He said: "Soviet leaders say they are prepared to stop testing hydrogen superbombs if we do the same." He pointed out that this is a starting point that the United States can take advantage of without worry.

However, Stevenson does not oppose the U.S.'s policy of arms expansion and war preparation. He said that an agreement banning hydrogen bomb tests does not mean that the U.S. abandons research and development in creating giant new weapons; the U.S. can continue to mass-produce weapons that have already been tested and maintain some reserves.

    史蒂文森再次主张停止氢弹试验
    认为一旦使用氢弹美国受害最大
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社纽约24日讯：前民主党总统候选人史蒂文森在预定在2月5日出版的美国“展望”杂志上发表一篇文章，再一次主张美国签订一项禁止试验氢弹的国际协定。
    作者说，在去年美国总统竞选运动以前和竞选运动期间，他就建议美国主动努力争取签订禁止这类试验的协定。但是，这个建议“事实上遭到白宫的轻视”，并且受到尼克松、杜威和共和党的其他负责人的猛烈抨击。
    史蒂文森说，他认为，如果一旦使用氢弹的话，美国将受到的损失要比其他任何国家都大。他说：“苏联的领导人说，他们准备停止氢素超级爆炸物的试验，如果我们也这样做的话。”他指出，这是美国可以无忧无虑加以利用的一个起点。
    不过，史蒂文森并不反对美国奉行的扩军备战政策。他说，禁止氢弹试验的协定并不意味着美国放弃在创造巨型新式武器方面的研究工作和发展，美国可以继续大量生产已经试验过的武器和保持一些储备。
