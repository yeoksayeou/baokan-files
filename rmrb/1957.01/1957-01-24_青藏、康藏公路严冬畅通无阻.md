Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, January 23rd: Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhao Qi reports: The Tibetan Plateau is now in the season of ice and snow, a time once described as "the coldest months when you crawl like a dog." However, with the efforts of all highway workers fighting against the severe cold, the Qinghai-Tibet and Sichuan-Tibet highways have remained unobstructed. The busy transportation scene on the highways increasingly demonstrates the enormous role these two highway arteries play in benefiting the Tibetan people.

The Qinghai-Tibet Highway, with an average altitude of over 4,000 meters, is now covered in white snow across thousands of miles of grassland. Deep at night, convoys often drive without headlights, relying on moonlight and starlight to navigate and advance through the sea of snow according to their direction. Temperatures on most sections of the road drop to minus 30 or 40 degrees Celsius. Around the New Year, the wind and snow on the northern Tibetan grasslands were heavy, but during this period, the two weekly passenger buses departing north from Lhasa continued to operate as usual. Thousands of tons of supplies were transported to Lhasa, and large ten-ton trucks traveled between Lhasa and Golmud in Qinghai Province in just over seven days.

On this long highway, one can often see vivid scenes of drivers battling the severe winter on the plateau. Level six or seven gales stir up blinding snow, and the vehicles keep their engines running day and night. Drivers often doze off briefly while holding the steering wheel to prevent the water tanks from freezing, and then continue driving. Liu Tingsong, a passenger bus driver on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, was carrying twenty-nine Tibetan passengers to Heihe when he encountered heavy snow. The vehicle was stuck in snow more than one meter deep. He knelt on the snow and dug out a path, then drove the vehicle forward. When they arrived at Heihe Station, the Tibetan passengers all came to hold his hands and warmly bid him farewell. Liu Huaiqing, a driver who set a record of driving thirteen kilometers per gallon of gasoline on the plateau, once encountered a situation where his vehicle was transporting timber and became stuck in an ice pit. He and his assistant, Zhang Shuqing, unloaded the timber, then lay down in the ice pit and chipped away at the ice in front of and behind the wheels. They worked hard all night, and their clothes were frozen together with the ice. Before dawn, the assistant and the master supported each other, their bodies half-frozen, and stood up from the ice, driving the vehicle forward.

Along the Sichuan-Tibet Highway, the drivers see a different winter scene. On high mountains such as Sejila and Niela, which are about 5,000 meters above sea level, the cold wind howls and thick snow accumulates, but there are many warm river valleys with sunshine below the mountains. The drivers have already mastered the winter driving patterns on this route. They often travel early in the morning, pass through the bitterly cold high mountain areas, and arrive in the river valleys for meals and overnight stays.

Currently, transportation on the Sichuan-Tibet Highway is very busy. Before the New Year, large quantities of construction materials such as steel and cement were transported from the interior to Lhasa to support Tibet's capital construction this year. In the first quarter of this year, the transportation volume on the Sichuan-Tibet Highway will increase by 30% compared to the same period last year. Now, large quantities of New Year goods, daily necessities, food, and basic construction equipment are being shipped to Lhasa one after another.

The road maintenance workers on the Qinghai-Tibet and Sichuan-Tibet highways are now monitoring the movements of the plateau wind and snow day and night. They often break ice and push snow overnight on the mountains and in the open fields, ensuring that these two highways remain unobstructed in the severe winter.

### 青藏、康藏公路严冬畅通无阻

    青藏、康藏公路严冬畅通无阻
    据新华社拉萨23日电　新华社记者赵奇报道：西藏高原现在正是冰雪封山，过去被人们形容为“十冬腊，学狗爬”的季节，但是在公路全体职工同严寒搏斗下，青藏、康藏两条公路一直畅通无阻。公路线上繁忙的运输情景，日益显示出这两条公路动脉为西藏人民造福的巨大作用。
    平均拔海四千公尺以上的青藏公路，现在白雪复盖着千里草原。深夜里，成群车队常常闭着车灯，借着月色星光赶路，依照方向在雪海中前进。大部分的路段气温降到摄氏零下三、四十度。新年前后，藏北草原风雪正大，但这个期间，从拉萨北开的每星期两班客车照常行驶，成千吨的物资运到拉萨，载重十吨的大卡车往返拉萨和青海省噶尔穆之间，只要七天多时间。
    在这条漫长的公路线上，经常可以看到驾驶员们同高原严冬搏斗的生动情景。六、七级的大风卷起迷眼的雪雾，汽车昼夜不熄火。驾驶员们为了不让水箱冰冻，常常抱着方向盘小睡一会便又继续前进。青藏公路上的客车驾驶员刘庭松，载着二十九个藏族旅客去黑河，路上遇大雪，车子陷在一公尺多深的雪里，他就跪在雪上挖出一条路，然后驾着车子前进。到黑河站的时候，藏族旅客们都来拉着他的手，亲热地向他祝福道别。创造一加仑汽油在高原行驶十三公里纪录的驾驶员刘怀清，一次载运木料，车子陷进冰坑，他和助手张树清把木料卸下来，然后躺到冰坑里，敲凿车轮前后的冰块，辛劳了一夜，身上的衣服和冰层都冻在一起。黎明前，助手和师傅互相搀扶着半僵硬的身体从冰上站起来，驾车继续前进。
    在康藏公路沿线，驾驶员们看到的却是另一派冬季景色。拔海五千公尺左右的色齐拉、年拉等高山上是寒风狂啸，厚雪堆积，但是山下却有很多阳光照射的温暖河谷，驾驶员们已经掌握了这条线路上的冬季行车规律，他们常常在清晨赶路，穿过酷寒的高山地带，赶到河谷吃饭和过夜。
    目前，康藏公路线上的运输十分繁忙，新年前，大批的钢筋、水泥等建设材料从内地运到拉萨，支援西藏今年的基本建设。今年第一季度，康藏公路的运输量将比去年同季增加30％。现在，大批的年货、日用品、食品和基本建设器材正陆续向拉萨启运。
    青藏、康藏两条公路上的道班工人们，现在正日夜监视着高原风雪的动向，他们常常在山上和旷野里连夜打冰推雪，保证了这两条公路在严冬里一直畅通无阻。
