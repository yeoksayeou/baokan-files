    From "Truman Doctrine" to "Eisenhower Doctrine"
    Deng Chao
    On March 12, 1947, then-U.S. President Truman asked Congress to allocate $400 million to "aid" the then-reactionary governments of Greece and Turkey to "defend against the communist threat." This is the so-called "Truman Doctrine."
    On January 5, 1957, incumbent U.S. President Eisenhower asked Congress to freely dispose of $400 million to "aid" Middle Eastern countries to "defend against the communist threat," and also asked Congress to authorize the U.S. President to use U.S. armed forces to "protect" the "independence" of Middle Eastern countries. This is the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine."
    Both the "Truman Doctrine" and the "Eisenhower Doctrine" are U.S. colonialism under different brands. They both use the "communist threat" as an excuse and U.S. "aid" as a cover to promote the U.S. policy of colonial expansion. However, the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is more aggressive than the "Truman Doctrine." From the "Truman Doctrine" to the "Eisenhower Doctrine," it marks the path of U.S. colonialists toward increasing arrogance and ferocity.
        Ten Years of Cold War
    The international environment when Truman proposed the "aid" to Greece and Turkey plan was roughly as follows: In Europe, the foreign ministers of the four countries, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, held a meeting in Moscow and engaged in fierce struggles over the handling of the German question; the Eastern European People's Democratic countries were in the initial stages of nation-building, their economic foundations were not yet consolidated, and domestic class struggles were very sharp; in Asia, the struggle was focused on the situation in China, and the U.S. plot to "mediate the Chinese civil war" had been completely exposed. In the U.S. Congress, some reactionary members even openly advocated that MacArthur should rule China. In addition, many countries in Asia and Africa were in the process of striving for their independence. In general, progressive forces and reactionary forces were engaged in an extremely fierce struggle. On the other hand, within the imperialist bloc, fierce economic and political struggles were taking place between the United States and Britain, and the most acute area of struggle was the Middle East, because the Middle East is a rich oil-producing area and a strategic location.
    The United States announced the so-called "Truman Doctrine" with one purpose: to use the smokescreen of "anti-Soviet and anti-communist" to control Greece and Turkey, establish a U.S. military and political base in the eastern Mediterranean, and use it as an important link in the military encirclement of the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democratic countries. Another purpose was to use the control of Greece and Turkey as a stepping stone to control the Middle East, squeeze out Britain, and establish an American "Middle East colonial empire."
    Facts have proved that the "Truman Doctrine" has failed. Although the United States used dollars to pull the then-reactionary governments of Greece and Turkey from under the wings of Britain into the arms of the United States, these two countries have also been undergoing changes recently. The Greek election on February 19, 1956, resulted in a major defeat for the pro-American parties, so that the mouthpiece of the U.S. ruling group, "U.S. News & World Report," could not help but lament that Greece was "a place where 2.8 billion dollars had not worked." As for Turkey, the "Washington Evening Star" said that "a strong wave of neutralism has been stirred up" in this country, and even said that the United States "has a 50 percent chance" of losing this "most loyal" friend. The United States wanted to use the "Truman Doctrine" to weaken socialist forces, especially to attack the Eastern European People's Democratic countries and control the entire Middle East, but it completely failed. In the nearly ten years since the "Truman Doctrine" was announced, neither the "liberation of Eastern Europe" policy nor the "brink of war" policy has been able to stop the victorious advance of socialist countries, and the socialist camp has grown stronger; the forces of national independence have grown up, the anti-colonialist movement has continued to rise, and a series of countries in Asia and North Africa have emerged that have broken free from colonial shackles and gained independence. Britain's "Middle East colonial empire" has collapsed, and the United States' "new Middle East colonial empire" plan has not succeeded.
    This situation not only reflects the failure of the "Truman Doctrine," but also reflects the failure of the entire U.S. "cold war" and "position of strength" policy after the war. The joint struggle of socialist forces, national independence forces, plus the broader forces advocating the maintenance of peace, has continuously promoted the relaxation of the international situation, the gradual thawing of the Cold War, and the mainstream of peace, democracy, and socialism is surging forward.
    Under such circumstances, international reactionary forces are doing their best to struggle in an attempt to salvage their aggressive policy that has fallen into bankruptcy. Last year, the armed aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel, as well as the counter-revolutionary conspiracy launched by international reactionary forces in Hungary, were new counterattacks by the imperialist aggression group. After they suffered defeats in both Egypt and Hungary, they launched a new wave of anti-Soviet and anti-communist sentiment, trying to restore the "Cold War." The "Eisenhower Doctrine" was concocted at such a moment.
    Extending Claws to Nationally Independent Countries
    The development of the national independence movement and anti-colonialist struggle in Asia and Africa in the post-war period reached a new climax after the Bandung Conference. The old colonialists who had been dominating Asia and Africa for hundreds of years were directly hit, but the U.S. colonialists could not but fear the disintegration and crisis facing the entire colonial system. Therefore, U.S. imperialism is full of hatred and hostility towards nationally independent countries; it does everything possible to undermine the policy of peace and neutrality pursued by nationally independent countries. The Suez Canal incident gave the United States an opportunity to buy and sell short. The United States used the disgrace of Britain and France to seize political capital for itself, and disguised itself as an "anti-colonialist." But the fake is always fake. The disguised anti-colonialists were frightened by the momentum of the real anti-colonialist struggle. The vigorous development of the national movement in the Middle East after the defeat of the British, French, and Israeli invasion of Egypt, and the increasing moral prestige of the Soviet Union in Arab countries, all greatly exceeded the expectations of the United States. The development of this situation has created a great danger that the tricks played by the United States in the Suez Canal incident will completely go bankrupt. Therefore, the United States hastily announced its new policy of action - the "Eisenhower Doctrine."
    The U.S. ruling group, waving dollars in one hand and wielding a big stick in the other, posing as the "protector" of the Middle Eastern people, stated that it could never allow the Middle East to face the "threat of international communism," and that the United States would "fill" the "power vacuum" that appeared due to the expulsion of British and French colonialists from the Middle East. The drafters of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" say that they want to deal with the "threat of international communism," but in fact they want to deal with nationalism in the Middle East; what they call "filling the power vacuum" is in fact to replace the British and French colonialists in the Middle East. In a word, U.S. colonialists believe that now is the time for them to make great achievements in the Middle East.
    The colonialist and aggressive nature of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" far exceeds that of the "Truman Doctrine."
    In terms of scope, the "Truman Doctrine" only grabbed Greece and Turkey, while the "Eisenhower Doctrine" listed the entire Middle East as the U.S. sphere of influence.
    In terms of means, the "Truman Doctrine" still touted so-called non-military "aid" (the main points of the "Truman Doctrine" are: to give Greece and Turkey financial aid, send non-military personnel to assist Greece and Turkey, send a limited number of military personnel to work in Greece and Turkey in an advisory capacity, provide Greece and Turkey with services, materials, and intelligence, and train personnel from Greece and Turkey), while the "Eisenhower Doctrine" openly announced that the United States would spend money to establish "security forces" controlled by the United States, which are actually full-fledged U.S. mercenaries. It even openly announced that the Middle East would be placed under the "protection" of U.S. military forces, which is to permanently impose colonial shackles on the nationally independent countries of the Middle East, and not allow them to act as masters of their own countries. And the U.S. ruling group also said that this arrogant practice of theirs is for the safety and interests of the people of all countries in the Middle East. Compared with the old British and French colonialists, the U.S. colonialists are indeed more sinister and ferocious!
    Holding the "British Empire" by the Throat
    Speaking of the Middle East, we are reminded of a sentence said by the late British Foreign Secretary Bevin: The oil and strategic value of the Middle East constitutes the throat of the British Empire.
    Speaking of the Middle East, we are also reminded of the secret agreement between Roosevelt and Churchill in Casablanca in 1943, which divided the spheres of influence of Britain and the United States after the war: Britain controlled the Middle East, and the United States controlled the Far East. In Britain's view, defending the Middle East is the primary condition for "sharing the world" with the United States, and more importantly, the Middle East brings Britain $1 billion in revenue every year.
    In the post-war period, Britain has repeatedly tried to establish a complete colonial system controlled by Britain in the Middle East in terms of politics, economy, and military affairs, such as the "Greater Syria Plan" (including Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine), and the "Fertile Crescent Plan" (the above-mentioned countries plus Iraq). Britain attempted to use this as the core to further control Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Turkey, Iran, and Greece. These plans have not been realized due to the opposition of the people of the Middle East, coupled with the secret sabotage and obstruction of the United States.
    The United States has been doing its best to squeeze out Britain and expand its own power. The agreement signed by the British-Iraqi Oil Company and Mobil Oil Company at the end of 1946 has forced Britain to agree to the United States' intervention in Iran, but the agreement stipulates that Britain controls 55.9% of Iran's oil shares. Britain still has the upper hand. In 1947, the United States pulled Greece and Turkey away from British control, which was the most painful thing for Britain, but it was also something that Britain could do nothing about. After that, the United States stepped up its efforts to squeeze out Britain and invade the Middle East. It has continuously expanded its investment in Middle Eastern oil economically, quickly crushing Britain's original advantage. In 1937, Britain controlled 80.9% of the Middle East's oil production, while the United States only accounted for 12.8%. In 1956, Britain only accounted for 30%, while the United States rose to 65%. An important factor in the increase in the U.S. share is that the United States forced Britain to once again give up a large portion of its oil interests in Iran (Britain and the United States each control 40% of Iranian oil). The rise and fall reflected in oil control is precisely the clear evidence that Britain is being fiercely squeezed out by the United States in the Middle East.
    In the political field, the struggle between Britain and the United States is even more acute. Since the post-war period, in the face of the increasingly high tide of the national independence movement, British and American imperialists have taken joint action more than once to oppose the national movement. For example, the so-called "Middle East Command" plan of the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey, as well as the so-called Middle East Declaration of the United States, Britain, and France in 1950, all contained the purpose of suppressing the national movement in the Middle East. But on the other hand, the United States is also trying to use the national movement to achieve the purpose of squeezing out and weakening British power. For example, the United States once attempted to use the 1954 Anglo-Egyptian agreement on the withdrawal of British troops from the Suez Canal Zone to replace Britain's position in Egypt. Britain has carried out resistance to the U.S. offensive that has not been without effect. The establishment of the Baghdad Pact Group shows that Britain is unwilling to let the United States take the lead in establishing political and military groups in the Middle East. Although Britain has repeatedly asked the United States to join the Baghdad Pact to strengthen the group, Britain has never intended to give up its leadership of the group.
    In order to maintain its colonial position in the Middle East, Britain has made huge concessions to the United States in many things, but when Britain asked the United States to support Britain's Middle East policy in fact rather than in words, it was flatly rejected by the United States. Especially after the Suez Canal incident, Britain immediately felt that one aspect of the United States' two-faced policy was directed against Britain. Eden took a desperate military adventure, originally wanting to quickly defeat Egypt and deter Arab countries in order to force the United States to recognize the fait accompli. However, the disastrous defeat of the war of aggression completely shattered all of Eden's illusions. Not only was Britain's relationship with Arab countries so bad that it could not be salvaged, but it also greatly weakened its position in the Baghdad Pact Group, which it had painstakingly managed. The United States took the opportunity to put up the signboard of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," attempting to squeeze out Britain and France and dominate the Middle East.
    From Failure to Greater Failure
    No matter what wishful thinking the U.S. ruling group is playing, the "Eisenhower Doctrine's" conspiracy to suppress the national independence movement is doomed to fail. The "Eisenhower Doctrine" will only end up in a more miserable situation than the "Truman Doctrine."
    The failure of the Truman Doctrine already marked the bankruptcy of the dollar and big stick policy. And today, ten years later, the world situation is even more different. The awakening of the people of all countries in the Middle East has reached an unprecedented level, and they are much more experienced in the anti-colonialist struggle than they were ten years ago. The recent disastrous defeat of the British, French, and Israeli aggressors in Egypt shows that the policy of military threat cannot work on the people of the Middle East. They can tell who their real friends are and who their enemies are. They simply will not believe in the so-called "communist threat" fabricated by the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Sober public opinion in the Middle East has solemnly pointed out that what threatens the security of the Middle East is not communism but Western colonialism. The people of the Middle East will also never be misled by the "aid" touted by the "Eisenhower Doctrine." They have learned a good lesson from the current encounter of Turkey, and understand what the US "aid" means to their countries. The people of the Middle East deeply know that as long as they follow the path of national independence, rely on self-reliance, and cooperate with other countries on an equal and mutually beneficial basis, their national economy will be stable and developed. This is why the "Eisenhower Doctrine," before it has even been officially launched, has already aroused widespread anger and opposition among the people of all countries in the Middle East. As Comrade Khrushchev said, the "Eisenhower Doctrine" will surely end up in a situation that will be notorious for thousands of years!

### 从“杜鲁门主义”到“艾森豪威尔主义”

    从“杜鲁门主义”到“艾森豪威尔主义”
    邓超
    1947年3月12日，当时的美国总统杜鲁门向国会要求拨款四亿美元“援助”希腊和土耳其的当时的反动政府，以“防御共产主义威胁”。这就是所谓“杜鲁门主义”。
    1957年1月5日，现任美国总统艾森豪威尔向国会要求自由支配四亿美元，“援助”中近东国家，以“防御共产主义威胁”，并且要求国会授权美国总统使用美国武装部队以“保护”中东国家的“独立”。这就是所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”。
    “杜鲁门主义”和“艾森豪威尔主义”都是不同商标的美国殖民主义。它们同样以“共产主义威胁”为借口，用美国“援助”作幌子，来推行美国的殖民扩张政策。不过“艾森豪威尔主义”比“杜鲁门主义”更富于侵略性。从“杜鲁门主义”到“艾森豪威尔主义”，标志着美国殖民主义者走向日益狂妄和凶恶的道路。
        冷战十年
    杜鲁门提出“援助”希、土计划时的国际环境大致是这样的：在欧洲，苏、美、英、法四国外长在莫斯科举行会议，在处理德国问题上展开激烈的斗争；东欧各人民民主国家正处在建国初期，经济基础还不巩固，国内阶级斗争十分尖锐；在亚洲，斗争集中在中国局势方面，美国“调处中国内战”的阴谋已经完全暴露，在美国国会中，有些反动议员竟公开主张由麦克阿瑟来统治中国。此外，亚非地区许多国家还正处在争取自己的独立的过程中。总起来说，进步力量与反动势力在进行着一场极其激烈的斗争。在另一方面，在帝国主义集团内部，美英之间进行着激烈的经济和政治的斗争，斗争特别尖锐的地区是中东，因为中东是丰富的石油产区和战略要地。
    美国宣布所谓“杜鲁门主义”，一个目的，是要利用“反苏反共”的烟幕，把希腊和土耳其控制在自己的手中，建立美国在地中海东部的军事和政治的基地，作为对苏联和东欧人民民主国家进行军事包围的一个重要环节。另一个目的是以控制希土作为控制中东、排挤英国、建立美国的“中东殖民帝国”的垫脚石。
    事实证明：“杜鲁门主义”是失败了。美国虽然用美元把当时的希、土反动政府从英国的卵翼下拉到美国的怀抱里，但是这两个国家近来也在发生着变化。1956年2月19日的希腊选举，亲美党派遭到重大失败，以致美国统治集团的喉舌“美国新闻与世界报道”不禁感叹说：希腊是“二十八亿美元所没有起作用的地方”。至于土耳其，“华盛顿晚报”说，在这个国家中“已激起了强烈的中立主义浪潮”，甚至说美国“有一半的可能”失去这个“最忠诚的”朋友。美国想利用“杜鲁门主义”达到削弱社会主义力量，特别是打击东欧人民民主国家以及控制整个中东的目的，却完全落空了。“杜鲁门主义”宣布后的近十年来，不论是“解放东欧”政策也好，或是“战争边缘”政策也好，都无法阻挡社会主义国家的胜利前进，社会主义阵营日益壮大；民族独立的力量已经成长起来，反殖民主义运动不断高涨，亚洲和北非都出现了一系列挣脱殖民枷锁、获得了独立的国家，英国的“中东殖民帝国”已经崩溃，而美国的“新中东殖民帝国”计划也没有成功。
    这样的形势不仅是反映了“杜鲁门主义”的失败，而是反映战后美国整个“冷战”和“实力地位”政策的失败。社会主义力量、民族独立力量，再加上范围更广的主张维护和平的力量的联合斗争，使国际局势不断走向缓和，冷战逐渐解冻，和平、民主与社会主义的主流在浩荡奔流。
    在这种情况下，国际反动势力竭力进行挣扎，以图挽救已经陷于破产的侵略政策。去年，英、法、以对埃及发动的武装侵略以及国际反动势力在匈牙利发动的反革命阴谋，就是帝国主义侵略集团的新反扑。当他们在埃及和在匈牙利同样遭到了失败以后，又掀起了反苏反共的新浪潮，力图恢复“冷战”。“艾森豪威尔主义”就是在这样一个时辰泡制出来的。
    向民族独立国家伸出魔爪
    战后时期亚非两洲民族独立运动和反殖民主义斗争的发展，在万隆会议以后达到了一个新的高潮，受到直接打击的固然是在亚非地区作威作福了几百年的旧殖民主义者，但是美国殖民者也不能不为整个殖民制度面临解体、危机而恐惧。因此，美帝国主义对民族独立国家充满了仇恨和敌意；对民族独立国家所执行的和平中立政策百般加以破坏。苏伊士事件发生后，给了美国一个买空卖空的机会。美国利用了英、法的声名扫地来为自己攫取政治资本，把自己乔装改扮成为“反殖民主义者”。可是假的总归是假的。伪装的反殖民主义者被真正的反殖民主义斗争的声势吓住了。英、法、以侵埃战争失败后中东民族运动的蓬勃发展，苏联在阿拉伯国家中道义上的威信日增，这一切都是大大出乎美国的意料的。这种形势的发展，大有使美国在苏伊士事件中玩弄的诡计有彻底破产的危险。因此，美国匆忙宣布它的新的行动方针——“艾森豪威尔主义”。
    美国统治集团一手摇晃着美元，一手挥舞着大棒，以中东人民的“保护者”的姿态，表示决不能任由中东地区面临着“国际共产主义的威胁”，美国要“填补”由于英法殖民者被踢出中东地区而出现的“势力真空”。“艾森豪威尔主义”的拟订者嘴里说要对付“国际共产主义威胁”，事实上是要对付中东的民族主义；他们所谓要“填补势力真空”，事实上就是要取代英法殖民者在中东作威作福的地位。一句话，美国殖民主义者认为现在已经是他们在中东大展鸿图的时候了。
    “艾森豪威尔主义”的殖民主义和侵略性质远远超过了“杜鲁门主义”。
    就范围来说，“杜鲁门主义”只把希腊和土耳其抓在手里，而“艾森豪威尔主义”却把整个中东列为美国的势力范围。
    就手段来说，“杜鲁门主义”还标榜所谓非军事方面的“援助”（“杜鲁门主义”的要点是：给予希、土以财政上的援助，派遣非军事人员协助希、土，派遣有限数目的军事人员以顾问资格去希、土工作，供给希、土以服务、物资和情报，训练希土两国人员），而“艾森豪威尔主义”公开宣布由美国出钱建立由美国控制的“保安部队”，实际上就是十足的美国雇佣兵。它甚至还公开宣布把中东放在美国军事力量“保护”之下，这就是永远要把殖民锁链加在中东民族独立国家身上，不让他们充当自己国家的主人。而美国统治集团还把他们这种狂妄的做法说成是为了中东各国人民的安全和利益。比起老牌的英、法殖民者来，美国殖民者实在阴险而又凶恶得多！
    扼住“大英帝国”的咽喉
    提起中东，我们就记起英国已故外相贝文说过的一句话：中东的石油和战略价值构成大英帝国的咽喉。
    提起中东，我们还会想起罗斯福和丘吉尔1943年的卡萨布兰卡的秘密协定，这个协定划分了英美战后的势力范围：英国控制中东，美国控制远东。在英国看来，守住中东的阵地是与美国“分庭抗礼”的首要条件，而更重要的是中东每年要给英国带来十亿美元的收入。
    在战后时期中，英国曾经一再试图在中东建立一个由英国控制的政治、经济、军事的完整的殖民体系，如“大叙利亚计划”（包括叙利亚、黎巴嫩、约旦、巴勒斯坦），“肥沃新月计划”（上述各国再加上伊拉克），英国企图以此为核心，进而控制沙特阿拉伯、也门、土耳其、伊朗和希腊等国。这些计划由于中东人民的反对，再加上美国的暗中破坏和阻挠而没有实现。
    美国极力排挤英国，扩张自己的势力。1946年底英伊石油公司与美孚油公司签订的协定，已经迫使英国同意美国插足伊朗，不过协定规定英国掌握伊朗石油股份额的55.9％。英国仍占优势。1947年美国把希腊、土耳其从英国掌握下拉走，却是英国最心痛的事，但也是英国无可奈何之事。在这以后，美国加紧排挤英国，侵入中东。在经济上不断扩大对中东石油的投资，迅速将英国的原有优势打垮。1937年英国控制了中东石油产量的80.9％，美国只占12.8％，1956年，英国只占有30％，而美国却上升为65％。美国比重上升的一个重要因素，是美国迫使英国再一次让出很大一部分在伊朗的石油权益（英美各控制伊朗石油的40％）。反映在石油控制权上的消长，正是英国在中东受到美国激烈排挤的明证。
    在政治领域中，英美斗争更加尖锐。战后以来，在日益高涨的民族独立运动面前，英美帝国主义者不只一次地采取联合行动来反对民族运动。比如美国策划的美、英、法三国加上土耳其的所谓“中东司令部”计划，以及1950年美、英、法三国的所谓中东宣言，都包含着镇压中东民族运动的目的。但是另一方面，美国又力图利用民族运动来达到排挤和削弱英国势力的目的。比如美国曾经企图利用关于英军撤出苏伊士运河区的1954年英埃协定取代英国在埃及的地位。英国对美国的进攻进行了不是毫无效果的抵抗，巴格达条约集团的建立，表明英国不甘心让美国在建立中东地区的政治军事集团方面抢先。英国虽然一再要求美国参加巴格达条约以加强这个集团，但是英国从来没有打算放弃对这个集团的领导权。
    英国为了维护它在中东的殖民地位，在许多事情上曾对美国作出了巨大的让步，但是当英国要求美国在事实上而不是在口头上支持英国在中东政策的时候，却遭到美国一口拒绝。特别是苏伊士事件发生后，英国立即感觉到了美国两面政策的一个方面是针对英国的。艾登采取孤注一掷的军事冒险，本来是想迅速打垮埃及，威慑阿拉伯国家，以迫使美国不得不承认既成事实。可是侵略战争的惨败，彻底粉碎了艾登的一切幻想，不仅英国与阿拉伯国家的关系恶劣到了无法收拾的地步，而且还大大削弱了它在苦心经营的巴格达条约集团中的地位美国就乘机打出“艾森豪威尔主义”的招牌，企图排挤英法，独霸中东。
    从失败走向更大的失败
    不管美国统治集团打着什么样的如意算盘，“艾森豪威尔主义”镇压民族独立运动的阴谋是注定要失败的。“艾森豪威尔主义”只会落得比“杜鲁门主义”更惨的下场。
    杜鲁门主义的失败就已经标志着美元与大棒政策的破产。而在十年后的今天，世界的形势是更加不同了。中东各国人民的觉醒已达到了空前未有的程度，他们在反殖民主义的斗争中比十年前有经验得多。最近英、法、以侵略者在埃及遭到的惨败，表明武力威胁政策在中东人民身上是起不了作用的。他们分得清谁是他们真正的朋友，谁是他们的敌人。他们根本不会相信有什么“艾森豪威尔主义”所捏造的所谓“共产主义威胁”，中东的清醒的舆论已经严正地指出：威胁着中东安全的不是共产主义而是西方殖民主义。中东人民也决不会被“艾森豪威尔主义”所标榜的“援助”所迷惑。他们从土耳其今天的遭遇中已得到很好的教训，明白美国的“援助”对他们的国家意味着什么。中东人民深深知道只要遵循着民族独立的道路依靠自力更生和同其他国家平等互利合作，他们的国家经济就能够稳定并且获得发展。这就是为什么“艾森豪威尔主义”还没有正式出炉，就已经在中东各国人民中间引起了普遍的愤怒和反对。正如赫鲁晓夫同志所说的：“艾森豪威尔主义”必将落得一个遗臭万年的下场！
