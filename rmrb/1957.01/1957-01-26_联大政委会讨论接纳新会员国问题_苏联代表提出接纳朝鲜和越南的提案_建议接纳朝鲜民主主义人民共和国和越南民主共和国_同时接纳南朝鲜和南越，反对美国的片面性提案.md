Xinhua News Agency, January 25th, New York: The United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee discussed the issue of admitting new member states at its meetings on the 23rd and 24th.

Thirteen countries, including the United States, Britain, France, Japan, and Italy, put forward two proposals at the meeting. One proposal requested the admission of South Korea to the United Nations, and the other proposal requested the admission of South Vietnam to the United Nations. The proposals argued that both South Korea and South Vietnam are "qualified" to obtain United Nations membership, and the proposals requested the Security Council to consider the applications of South Korea and South Vietnam to join the United Nations.

U.S. Representative Greenbaum, in defending these two proposals, insisted that the fact that South Korea and South Vietnam had not joined the United Nations was an "injustice," and he demanded that South Korea and South Vietnam be allowed to join the United Nations this year.

Representatives from Britain, France, Japan, and other countries supported the thirteen-nation proposals in their speeches.

Soviet Representative Sobolev also put forward a proposal. This proposal requested the admission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the United Nations, and also the admission of South Korea and South Vietnam to the United Nations, rather than advocating only the admission of South Korea and South Vietnam, as in the thirteen-nation proposals.

Soviet Representative Sobolev pointed out in his speech that the South Korean government is a regime of terror, and this government has consistently opposed the unification of this divided country. As for South Vietnam, it still pursues colonial policies. The only difference is that French colonialism has been replaced by American-brand colonialism. Sobolev firmly stated that admitting South Korea and South Vietnam into the United Nations now would only deepen the divided state of these two countries. This would be a revival of the bankrupt policy of supporting the admission of one country at the expense of another.

Representatives from Ukraine and Bulgaria supported the Soviet proposal. Ukrainian Representative Kizya said that he would vote in favor of the U.S.-backed recommendation to admit South Korea and South Vietnam if the United States supported the Soviet demand to simultaneously admit the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Otherwise, he would vote against the thirteen-nation proposals.

The committee's discussion on this issue will continue.

    联大政委会讨论接纳新会员国问题
    苏联代表提出接纳朝鲜和越南的提案
    建议接纳朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国
    同时接纳南朝鲜和南越，反对美国的片面性提案
    新华社25日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会特别政治委员会在23日和24日会议上讨论接纳新会员国问题。
    美国、英国、法国、日本和意大利等十三个国家在会上提出两个提案，一个提案要求接纳南朝鲜参加联合国，另一个提案要求接纳南越参加联合国。提案认为，南朝鲜和南越都是“有资格”取得联合国会员国籍的，提案要求安全理事会考虑南朝鲜和南越加入联合国的申请。
    美国代表格林博姆在为这两个提案辩护时硬说南朝鲜和南越没有加入联合国是一个“不公正”的现象，他要求让南朝鲜和南越在今年加入联合国。
    英国、法国和日本等国代表在发言中支持十三国提案。
    苏联代表索波列夫也提出一个提案，这个提案要求接纳朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国参加联合国，同时也接纳南朝鲜和南越参加联合国，而不是像十三国提案那样主张只接纳南朝鲜和南越参加。
    苏联代表索波列夫在发言时指出，南朝鲜政府是一个恐怖政权，这个政府一直反对统一这个分裂的国家。至于南越，它仍然奉行殖民地的政策。唯一的不同是法国殖民主义已经被美国牌的殖民主义代替了。索波列夫坚决地说，在现在接纳南朝鲜和南越进入联合国只会加深这两个国家的分裂状态。这将是赞成接纳一个国家而牺牲另外一个国家那种已经破产的政策的复活。
    乌克兰和保加利亚代表支持苏联的提案。乌克兰代表基齐亚说，他将投票赞成得到美国支持的接纳南朝鲜和南越的建议，如果美国支持苏联要求同时接纳朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国的建议。否则，他将投票反对十三国提案。
    委员会关于这个问题的讨论将继续进行。
