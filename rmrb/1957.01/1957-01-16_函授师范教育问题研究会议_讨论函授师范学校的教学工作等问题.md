Research Conference on Correspondence Teacher Training Education
Discusses Teaching Work in Correspondence Teacher Training Schools and Other Issues

(Our newspaper dispatch) The Research Conference on Correspondence Teacher Training Education concluded in Beijing on January 13. The conference discussed several major issues related to the establishment and leadership, teaching plans, and teaching work of secondary correspondence teacher training schools.

Representatives from various regions unanimously agreed that the primary reason for the current low quality of primary education is the insufficient knowledge level of teachers. Therefore, the task of secondary correspondence teacher training schools should be to systematically improve the cultural knowledge of primary school teachers, enabling them to reach a level equivalent to that of secondary normal school graduates. Continuing education should adhere to the principles of "necessity and possibility" and "learn less, learn better." The representatives suggested that the teaching plans of correspondence teacher training schools must have a certain degree of flexibility. For example, if teachers below the level of junior normal school complete and pass the examinations for Chinese language, arithmetic, and basic natural science, they should be considered to have reached a level equivalent to that of junior normal school graduates. Elderly teachers who find algebra and geometry difficult can switch to history and geography. The senior level should designate Chinese language as a required subject and divide mathematics, physics and chemistry, and history and geography into three groups. Teachers can choose any two groups to study and pass the examinations, which will be regarded as achieving a level equivalent to that of secondary normal school graduates. After completing any subject in the junior level or any group of courses in the senior level and passing the examinations, a certificate of completion for that subject or group can be obtained. Under the condition that students request and the school's resources permit, the junior level can establish physics and chemistry subjects, and the senior level can establish political science, education, and arithmetic courses for students to choose from. The representatives also suggested that self-taught teachers who have not participated in teacher training schools or correspondence teacher training schools can also obtain certificates of equivalent level if they pass the examination. Students can apply for exemption from courses they have already taken. The conference also determined that correspondence teaching should be based on self-study and that efforts should be strengthened to compile self-study guidance materials.

Regarding the establishment and leadership of schools, the representatives believed that specific conditions vary in different regions, and uniformity should not be forced. However, attention must be paid to facilitating leadership, strengthening teaching research activities, improving teaching quality, and ensuring economic efficiency.

    函授师范教育问题研究会议
    讨论函授师范学校的教学工作等问题
    本报讯　函授师范教育问题研究会议，已于1月13日在北京闭幕。会议讨论了目前中等函授师范学校的设置领导、教学计划、教学工作等一些重大问题。
    各地代表一致认为，目前小学教育质量不高的主要原因是教师知识水平不足，因此中等函授师范学校的任务应该是系统地提高小学教师文化知识，使他们达到相当于中等师范学校毕业的程度。进修应贯彻“需要与可能”、“学少一些，学好一些”的原则。代表们提出函授师范学校的教学计划必须具有一定灵活性，如不及初师水平的教师学完语文、算术、自然常识三科，考试及格，就应该认为已经达到相当于初师毕业的水平；年老教师学习代数、几何感到吃力，可以改为史地。高级部确定以语文为必修科，分数学、理化、史地三组，教师可以任意选修两组，考试及格，就作为达到了相当于中等师范毕业的水平。初级部学完任何一科，高级部学完任何一组的课程，考试及格，可取得该科或该组结业证明。在学员要求和学校力量许可的条件下，初级部可以设立理化科目，高级部可以设立政治、教育、算术等三科供学员选修。代表们还提出，未参加教师进修学校或函授师范学校的自修教师，经考试成绩及格者，同样可以取得相当水平的证书。学员们已经学过的课程，可以申请免修。会议并确定函授教学以自学为主，应该加强编写自学指导材料的工作。
    关于学校的设置和领导问题，代表们认为各地具体条件不同，不能强求统一，但必须注意便于领导，加强教学研究活动，提高教学质量和经济有效等要求。
