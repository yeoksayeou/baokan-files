Farmers in Jilin Mountainous Areas Actively Capture Wild Animals

(Our report) Farmers in the mountainous forest areas of Jilin Province are actively capturing wild animals. Many counties in the province's mountainous forest areas have, since the beginning of autumn last year, formed hunting teams by selecting commune members with hunting experience, on a township basis, to capture wild animals. Yongjiang Agricultural Cooperative of Liangmin Township, Ji'an County, killed sixteen black bears by using land-based guns. Farmers near the mountains in Huadian County have captured forty-one wild boars, black bears, and roe deer by adopting methods such as digging "pit traps" and setting "snares." By the end of December, Jiaohe County had captured a total of 416 wild boars, 262 black bears, 456 roe deer, and 20 wolves, which can be sold for more than 50,000 yuan. The commune members said with satisfaction: "Capturing wild animals is truly a double benefit. It can not only eliminate pests for everyone and ensure a bumper harvest in farmland, but also increase income."

    吉林山区农民积极捕捉野兽
    本报讯　吉林省山林地区的农民正在积极捕捉野兽。这个省的很多靠山林区的县份，从去年入秋以来，就以乡为单位，选择具有狩猎经验的社员，组成了打猎队，捕捉野兽。辑安县良民乡永江农业社，用下地枪的办法，打了十六只黑熊。桦甸县近山农民，采取挖“陷窖”、下“套子”等办法，捕捉野猪、黑熊、狍子四十一只。蛟河县到12月末，共捕打野猪四百一十六只、黑熊二百六十二只、狍子四百五十六只、狼二十只，可卖人民币五万多元，社员们满意地说：捕捉野兽，真是一举两得，不仅能为大家除害，保证农田丰收，还能增加收入。”
