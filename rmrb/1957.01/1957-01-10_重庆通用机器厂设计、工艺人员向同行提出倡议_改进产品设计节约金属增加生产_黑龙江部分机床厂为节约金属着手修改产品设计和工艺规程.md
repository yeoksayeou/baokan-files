Editor's Note: This year, the production of machinery and equipment in our country cannot meet the needs. The raw materials for the machinery industry—steel and non-ferrous metals—also cannot meet the needs of machinery industry production. Therefore, the focus of the increase production and practice economy campaign in the machinery industry should be on striving to increase production on the basis of saving metal. According to the current situation, the most important ways for the machinery industry to save metal are to improve product design and manufacturing methods. Therefore, the proposal put forward by the design and technological personnel of Chongqing General Machinery Factory is of great practical significance. We hope that the design and technological personnel of the machinery industry departments will actively respond to this proposal. When improving the design, it is necessary to overcome the timid mentality of shrinking back, and also adopt a cautious attitude, carefully conduct scientific calculations and experiments to prevent deviations and affect product quality.

　　This newspaper reports that design and technological personnel of Chongqing General Machinery Factory recently proposed to their colleagues in the city to boldly improve design, break the bad habits and unreasonable regulations in technological procedures, and accumulate funds for the country in the spirit of saving metal and increasing production.
　　Many product drawings of the General Machinery Factory are traced from foreign products. When studying the drawings and formulating technological regulations, they often think that everything is beyond reproach, and they dare not modify many things that can obviously be modified according to the actual situation of the factory. When brewing for increase production and practice economy, the design and technological personnel criticized this idea of mechanically copying and divorcing from reality, and re-examined and studied the performance structure of this year's products. On the secondary products of the pumping unit system, they plan to reduce the size and improve the structural parts, and it is estimated that 74,850 kilograms of shaped steel can be saved on No. 3, 5, and 6 pumping units throughout the year, and 150 sets of shaped steel parts for No. 3 pumping units can be produced; on the secondary products of the Ye's blower system, further increase the number of revolutions, reduce the machine body, and cancel unnecessary parts. It is estimated that 47,340 kilograms of metal can be saved throughout the year, and 47 No. 5 Ye's blowers can be produced; on axial flow fan products, use bamboo materials instead of steel plates to manufacture air ducts, and it is estimated that 52 tons of steel can be saved throughout the year. In terms of technological regulations, they plan to revise machining allowances, adopt and implement new technologies, further promote the method of centralized blanking and the system of quota material requisition, and improve material utilization. The design and manufacture of tooling and fixtures will strive to be simple and applicable, and strive to renovate and reuse old tools.
　　The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions resolutely supports their proposed increase production and practice economy plan and initiative, and is calling on the design and technological personnel of machinery factories throughout the city to respond.

　　This newspaper reports that units such as Harbin Electric Machinery Factory, Qiqihar First Machine Tool Factory, and Qiqihar Second Machine Tool Factory have started by modifying designs and technological regulations, and have tapped the huge potential for saving metal materials.
　　Technical personnel of the Design Section of Harbin Electric Machinery Factory modified the structure and dimensions of product components on the premise of ensuring product quality. The AC motor group modified the design of the 250-kilowatt synchronous motor, so that the amount of silicon steel sheet used for each motor was reduced by 180 kilograms, and the amount of steel used was reduced by 375 kilograms. Coupled with the modification of the designs of other types of motors, calculated according to the output from the first to the third quarter of this year, more than 60 tons of metal materials can be saved. The Technology Section strengthened the process analysis of medium-sized motor series products, adopted new technologies, improved process equipment, and can save an average of 15% to 20% of man-hours, and can save 200,000 yuan throughout the year.
　　After inspection, Qiqihar First Machine Tool Factory found that the material consumption of many parts during the parts processing process was very large. They organized personnel to study advanced processing methods, incorporated advanced processing experience into technological regulations, and reasonably stipulated processing allowances. For example, the "friction plate" component was changed from the original processing using steel material to "stamping" processing using sheet material. Each four "friction plates" can use one kilogram less steel than in the past, and three processing steps are saved, which increases processing efficiency by 240 times and improves quality.
　　Qiqihar Second Machine Tool Factory reviewed and revised the parts processing process of the 6Н82Г horizontal milling machine, and the steel used to produce one milling machine was reduced by 90 kilograms compared with the past. That is to say, the steel used to produce ten milling machines in the past can now be used to produce eleven milling machines.

    重庆通用机器厂设计、工艺人员向同行提出倡议
    改进产品设计节约金属增加生产
    黑龙江部分机床厂为节约金属着手修改产品设计和工艺规程
    编者按：今年，我国机械设备的生产不能够满足需要。机械工业的原料——钢铁和有色金属又不能满足机械工业生产的需要。因此，机械工业部门增产节约的中心应该是在节约金属的基础上努力增产。根据当前的情况，机械工业节约金属最重要的途径是改进产品设计和改进制造方法。因此，重庆通用机器厂设计、工艺人员提出的倡议，有很大实际意义。我们希望机械工业部门的设计、工艺人员都积极响应这个倡议。在改进设计的时候，要克服缩手缩脚的胆怯心理，也要采取谨慎的态度，仔细进行科学的计算和试验，防止发生偏差，影响产品质量。
    本报讯　重庆通用机器厂设计、工艺人员最近向全市同行提出倡议，本着节约金属、增加生产的精神，大胆改进设计，破除工艺规程方面的陋习和不合理的规定，为国家积累资金。
    通用机器厂的许多产品图样都是按照国外的产品测绘来的，在研究图纸和制定工艺规程时，常认为一切无可非难，有许多明明可以按照本厂实际情况加以修改的也不敢修改。酝酿增产节约时，设计、工艺人员批判了这种生搬硬套、脱离实际的思想，重新检查和研究了今年产品的性能结构。在抽油机系副产品上，准备缩小尺寸和改进结构零件，预计全年在三、五、六号抽油机上节约型钢七万四千八百五十公斤，增产三号抽油机型钢部件一百五十台；在叶氏鼓风机系副产品上，进一步提高转数，缩小机体，取消可要可不要的零件，预计全年可节约金属四万七千三百四十公斤，可增产五号叶氏鼓风机四十七台；在轴流式送风机产品上，利用竹料代替钢板制造导风箱，全年预计可节约钢材五十二吨。工艺规程方面准备修订加工余量，采用和贯彻新工艺，进一步推行集中下料的方法和限额领料制度，提高材料利用率。工卡具的设计和制造，将力求简单适用，尽量翻新和回用旧工具。
    中国第一机械工会重庆市委员会坚决支持他们提出的增产节约计划和倡议，正在号召全市机械厂的设计、工艺人员响应。

    本报讯　哈尔滨电机厂、齐齐哈尔第一机床厂、齐齐哈尔第二机床厂等单位从修改设计、工艺规程着手，挖出了节约金属材料的巨大潜力。
    哈尔滨电机厂设计科的技术人员在保证产品质量的前提下，修改了产品结构和部件的尺寸。交流电机组修改二百五十瓩同期电动机的设计，使每台电机的矽钢片用量减少了一百八十公斤，钢材用量减少了三百七十五公斤。加上其他品种电机的设计的修改，按今年一季到三季度的产量计算，就能节约六十多吨金属材料。工艺科加强中型电机系列产品的工艺分析工作，采用新技术，改善工艺装备，平均可节省工时15％至20％，全年可节约二十万元。
    齐齐哈尔第一机床厂经过检查，发现零件加工过程中有许多部件的材料消耗量很大。他们组织人员研究了先进加工方法，把先进加工经验充实纳入工艺规程中，合理规定加工留量。比如将“磨擦片”部件由原来采用钢料加工改为采用板材“冲压”加工，每四个“磨擦片”可比过去少用一公斤钢材，还省去三道加工工序，使加工效率提高二百四十倍，质量也好。
    齐齐哈尔第二机床厂对6Н82Г平铣床的部件加工工艺过程进行了审查修改，生产一台铣床用的钢料就比过去减少九十公斤。这也就是用原来生产十台铣床的钢料可以生产十一台铣床了。
