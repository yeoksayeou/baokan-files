    Our Premier Zhou Enlai was invited to pay a four-day friendly visit to our southwestern neighbor, the Kingdom of Nepal, and left Kathmandu yesterday. During his visit, Premier Zhou Enlai held friendly talks with Prime Minister Acharya of the Kingdom of Nepal and issued a joint communique. Premier Zhou Enlai was warmly and friendly welcomed by the people of Kathmandu and other parts of Nepal wherever he went.
    The friendship between the Chinese and Nepalese people has a long historical tradition. As early as more than a thousand years ago, the people of the two countries had close contacts. It was only after the colonialist forces invaded the East in the last hundred years that the normal relations between our two peoples were damaged and hindered. However, after China and Nepal successively achieved independence, especially since the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between our two countries, the friendly relations between the two countries have made considerable progress. The increasingly frequent contacts between the two countries have greatly enhanced mutual understanding between the two peoples. In May last year, our country sent Vice Premier Ulanhu as a special envoy to attend the coronation ceremony of King Mahendra of Nepal; in July, a cultural delegation headed by Nepal's Minister of Education, Health, and Local Autonomy, Sharma, paid a friendly visit to our country; on September 20, the government delegations of China and Nepal signed an agreement on maintaining friendly relations between the two countries and on commerce and transportation between the Tibet region of China and Nepal, thus fixing our traditional friendship and close good-neighborly relations in the form of a treaty in accordance with the well-known Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. At the same time, on this new and solid foundation, various historical issues in the relations between the two countries were successfully resolved. Of great significance was Prime Minister Acharya's friendly visit to our country in September last year and the joint statement issued with our Premier Zhou Enlai. This joint statement, in addition to confirming the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the basic principles guiding the relations between the two countries, also expressed common confidence and desire in the implementation of the agreement on maintaining friendly relations between the two countries and the further development of economic, trade, and cultural relations between the two countries. Another achievement of the talks was the signing of the China-Nepal Economic Assistance Agreement. In order to help Nepal implement its first five-year plan, our country will provide Nepal with 60 million Indian rupees in free and unconditional assistance within three years. All these encouraging examples and the major achievements of Premier Zhou Enlai's visit clearly demonstrate that the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Nepal have great vitality and broad prospects for development.
    The reason why the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Nepal have developed so rapidly and achieved such satisfactory results is by no means accidental. This is not only because our two peoples have a common experience of suffering from colonialism, but more importantly because our two peoples, like the peoples of Asian and African countries, have common goals in safeguarding our national independence and freedom, building our countries, and promoting the welfare of our people. This consistency of goals provides the basis for the unity between our two countries and between Asian and African countries.
    Mutual sympathy and support, mutual learning and assistance between the two peoples are important contents for developing friendly cooperation on a common basis. The people of our country have always believed that countries, regardless of their size, are equal to each other, and each has its own strengths and advantages worthy of learning from other countries. We fully sympathize with the efforts made by the Nepalese government and people to build their own country, and we are willing to help and learn from each other in the construction undertakings of the two countries. Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Nepal this time expressed this desire of the Chinese people.
    Linked by the foothills of the Himalayas are three close neighbors: China, Nepal, and India. There is a long-standing traditional friendship between our three countries, and we have long borders adjacent to each other. In the struggle to defend peace, oppose colonialism, and safeguard the independence of our countries, we have common interests and common aspirations. Just as the colonialists are not reconciled to their failure and are attempting to continue aggression and threats against the peoples of Asian and African countries, strengthening the friendly and cooperative relations between China, Nepal, and India is of great significance for ensuring the independent development of our respective countries, for promoting the unity and cooperation of the peoples of Asian and African countries, and for safeguarding the cause of peace. Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India and Nepal this time has undoubtedly further strengthened the traditional friendship between our three countries.

### 进一步加强中国和尼泊尔的友谊

    进一步加强中国和尼泊尔的友谊
    我国总理周恩来应邀到我国西南邻邦尼泊尔王国进行了为期四天的友好访问，并已于昨日离开加德满都。周恩来总理在访问期间曾和尼泊尔王国政府阿查里雅首相进行了友好会谈，并发表了联合公报。周恩来总理所到之处，曾受到了加德满都和尼泊尔各地人民极为热烈而友好的欢迎。
    中尼两国人民的友谊有着悠久的历史传统，早在一千多年以前，两国人民就有着亲密的往来。只是在近一百年来殖民主义势力侵入东方以后，才使我们两国人民之间的正常关系遭到了破坏和阻挠。但在中尼两国先后取得独立后，特别是我们两国正式建交以来，两国的友好关系又有了长足的进展。两国间日益频繁的接触，大大增进了两国人民间的互相谅解。去年5月间，我国曾派乌兰夫副总理为特使参加了尼泊尔马亨德拉国王的加冕盛典；7月间以尼泊尔教育、卫生、地方自治大臣夏尔马为首的文化代表团来我国进行友好访问；9月20日，中尼两国政府代表团签订了两国保持友好关系以及关于中国西藏地方和尼泊尔之间的通商和交通的协定，从而把我们两国传统的友谊和亲密的睦邻关系按照著名的和平共处五项原则，以条约的形式固定下来。同时在这一新的巩固的基础之上，顺利地解决了两国关系中历史上遗留下来的各项问题。具有重大意义的是阿查里雅首相去年9月间来我国进行友好访问，并和我国周恩来总理发表了联合声明。这一联合声明除了确认以和平共处五项原则为指导两国关系的基本原则以外，并对执行两国保持友好关系的协定和进一步发展两国的经济贸易和文化关系表示了共同的信心和愿望。会谈的另一成果是签订了中国尼泊尔经济援助协定。为帮助尼泊尔实行第一个五年计划，我国在三年内向尼泊尔无偿地不附带任何条件地提供六千万印度卢比的援助。所有这些令人鼓舞的事例和周恩来总理这次访问的重大收获，都清楚地说明中尼两国友好合作关系具有巨大的生命力和广阔的发展前途。
    中国和尼泊尔友好合作关系之所以发展得如此迅速，获得如此令人满意的成果，决不是偶然的。这不仅是因为我们两国人民有着遭受殖民主义之害的共同经历，而且更重要的是因为我们两国人民和亚非各国人民一样，在维护我们的民族独立和自由、建设我们的国家和推进我们人民的福利事业上有着共同的目标。这种目标的一致性，提供了我们两国以及亚非各国相互团结一致的基础。
    两国人民互相同情和支持、互相学习和帮助，是我们在共同的基础上发展友好合作的重要内容。我国人民一向认为国家无论大小，都是互相平等的，并且都有各自的长处和优点值得其他国家学习。我们完全同情尼泊尔政府和人民为了建设自己祖国所作的努力，并且愿意在两国的建设事业中互相帮助和学习。这次周恩来总理在尼泊尔的访问，正表达了中国人民的这一愿望。
    连结着喜马拉雅山麓，有中国、尼泊尔、印度三个亲密的邻邦。我们三国之间，有着历史悠久的传统友谊，有着相互毗连的漫长国境。在保卫和平、反对殖民主义斗争和维护自己国家的独立事业中，我们有共同的利益和共同的愿望。正当殖民主义者不甘心自己的失败，并企图对亚非各国人民继续进行侵略和威胁的时候，加强中、尼、印三国的友好合作关系，对于保障我们各自国家的独立发展，对于促进亚非各国人民的团结合作和维护和平的事业，都有重大的意义。我国总理这次对印度和尼泊尔的访问，无疑地已进一步加强了我们三国间的传统友谊。
