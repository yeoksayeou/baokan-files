    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 27th. East German Premier Otto Grotewohl addressed a mass rally of around two thousand citizens in Frankfurt an der Oder on the 25th. In his speech, he emphasized that the recent talks between the Soviet Union and East Germany in Moscow were another milestone on the road to strengthening fraternal cooperation between the two peoples. The talks primarily helped to maintain peace.
    Grotewohl stressed the importance of disarmament for peace. He said: "Socialist countries recognize this, and after speaking on this issue, they follow up with action. However, Western countries have not taken any steps to reduce the danger of war."
    Grotewohl pointed out that East Germany's policy is to resolutely safeguard world peace, and he drew attention to the great danger caused by the resurgence of West German militarism. He emphasized that living in peace requires crushing the threat of militarism in West Germany, which is also a prerequisite for the reunification of Germany.
    Grotewohl also condemned the "Eisenhower Doctrine" as a provocative policy.
    The latter part of Grotewohl's speech addressed domestic policy issues in East Germany. In this regard, he pointed out the great significance of Soviet economic assistance and discussed the tasks facing the working people in the further democratization of the country's social and political life.
    On the same day that Grotewohl spoke to the citizens of Frankfurt, other leaders of the East German government and members of parliament also made contact with residents to inform them about the Soviet-East German talks and to explain the significance of the measures recently taken by the parliament and the government to further develop democracy.

    民主德国领导人向群众解释最近政府措施
    新华社柏林27日电　民主德国总理格罗提渥25日在奥得河畔法兰克福的一次群众集会上向两千左右的市民讲了话。他在讲话中着重指出，不久以前在莫斯科举行的苏德两国的会谈是加强两国人民之间的兄弟合作的道路上的又一个里程碑。会谈首先有助于保持和平。
    格罗提渥强调裁军对和平的重要意义。他说：“社会主义国家认识到这一点，在这个问题上，讲过话以后就跟着采取行动。但是，西方国家却没有采取任何一个减轻战争危险的步骤。”
    格罗提渥指出民主德国的政策是坚决维护世界和平的，并且提请人们注意西德军国主义复活引起的巨大危险。他强调指出：要过和平生活就必须粉碎德国西部的军国主义的威胁，而这也是重新统一德国的先决条件。
    格罗提渥还谴责“艾森豪威尔主义”是一种挑衅性政策。
    格罗提渥讲话的后一部分谈到了民主德国的国内政策问题。在这方面，他指出了苏联的经济援助的重大意义，并且谈到了劳动人民在国家社会和政治生活的进一步民主化方面所面临的任务。
    在格罗提渥向法兰克福市民讲话的同一天，民主德国政府的其他一些领导人员和议会议员也同居民进行了接触，向他们介绍苏德会谈情况，并且解释议会和政府在最近采取的进一步发展民主的一些措施的意义。
