According to the Jiefang Daily: During the Spring Festival, the Shanghai Boiler Factory, Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 1, Shanghai Rubber Factory, and Huafu Fountain Pen Factory, among others, will invite suburban peasants to visit the factories and participate in get-togethers. These factories are actively preparing in recent days.

The workers of the Shanghai Rubber Factory have always had close ties with the peasants of several townships near the factory. Peasants have participated in every factory get-together, and this time they plan to invite nearly 300 peasants to the factory. Last summer, due to hot weather and lack of rain, the fields suffered from drought. The factory lent out water pumps seven times to help nearby peasants fight the drought, and sometimes sent people to start the engines. Usually, the factory gives the coal cinder from the furnaces to the peasants for paving roads free of charge. Therefore, some peasants voluntarily return their worn-out galoshes and sneakers to the waste recycling station to support the production of reclaimed rubber.

The workers of the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory and the peasants of the Hongqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Songbei Township, northern suburbs, are old friends. Every year during the Spring Festival, they have a large get-together. This Spring Festival, they plan to invite the peasants to visit the workshops. Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 plans to have a get-together with over a thousand peasants, starting from January 29th in batches. Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 1 is preparing to use small motorboats to pick up the peasants who live far from the factory. They will also listen to the peasants' achievements since cooperation and their experiences in overcoming natural disasters.

    上海许多工厂将邀请农民参观
    据解放日报讯　春节期间，上海锅炉厂、上钢一厂、上海柴油机厂、上海卷烟一厂、上海橡胶厂和华孚金笔厂等，都将邀请郊区农民来厂参观、联欢。这几天，各厂都在积极准备。
    上海橡胶厂的工人与厂附近几个乡的农民来往一向很密切，厂里的每一次联欢都有农民来参加，这次准备邀请近三百个农民来厂。去年夏天天热不下雨，田地遭到旱灾，该厂曾七次借出抽水机帮助附近农民抗旱，有时还随机去人发动引擎。平时，厂中把炉子上烧下来的煤渣，无偿地送给农民铺路。因此，有些农民就主动地把不能再穿的套鞋和球鞋回交废品站，以支援再生胶的生产。
    上海柴油机厂的工人与北郊区淞北乡红旗农业生产合作社的农民是老朋友，每年春节要大联欢一次，今年春节准备请农民参观车间。上钢一厂准备要与一千多个农民联欢，从本月29日起分批开始举行。上海卷烟一厂对距厂很远的农民，预备用小轮船去接他们，还将听取农民们合作化以后的成绩和战胜自然灾害的情况。
