    No Copyright, Repeated Printing Not Investigated
    Hū Yánbào
    Earlier published books would have the words "Copyright Reserved, Reprinting Must Be Investigated" or "Copyrighted, No Reprinting Allowed" printed on the back page. This meant that the copyright and publishing rights of the book belonged to the author or the bookstore that published it. Reprinting and publishing were only allowed with their permission.
    However, these words can no longer be found on currently published books, which means that such regulations have been implicitly forgotten.
    As a result, many editing and publishing departments, in pursuit of publishing quantity, have begun to produce shoddy work. Many works that have already been published multiple times are being endlessly compiled and selected; many books and works with identical content are being reprinted and repackaged without limit. You compile and select a certain work, and then I compile and select it; you publish it, and then I publish it. Many editing and publishing departments lack a clear division of labor and necessary coordination mechanisms, and the publishing regulations that are formulated exist in name only. In such a situation, once a work is published or a book is compiled, anyone can compile it however they want, and anyone can print it however they want. The author is absent from their work, and it's up to anyone to compile and print it; the editors simply pick up whatever is available and compile it arbitrarily as long as someone is publishing; the publishing house seems to think that as long as there's something, they’ll publish it regardless of duplication.
    Taking Li Wenyuan's novel "Marriage" as an example, after it was published in "Changjiang Literature and Art" in July 1954, the Henan People's Publishing House published it as a book titled "Marriage." In February 1956, the "Selected Short Stories" compiled by the Chinese Writers Association included this work and was printed once. Almost at the same time, "Marriage" was also selected for a collection of novels published by the China Youth Publishing House and printed once. In June 1956, the author again used "Marriage" as the title and, together with several other novels, submitted it to the China Youth Publishing House for another separate publication. Recently, the Henan Federation of Literary and Art Circles compiled works by Henan authors, and again selected "Marriage" for the Henan Youth Literary Creation Series "Xiao Hei" compiled by the association, which was published once again by the Henan People's Publishing House. One novel was printed six times in just over two years.
    Example two: The novel "The Devil's Hand Reaching for the Design Drawing" by Hong Yang and Liu Dai was published in "Changjiang Literature and Art" in September 1955. Almost at the same time, this work was included in three books: "Stories That Are Not Fiction" published by the Changjiang Literature and Art Publishing House, "The Devil's Hand Reaching for the Design Drawing" published by the China Youth Publishing House, and "Stories That Are Not Fiction" published by the Writers Publishing House. Recently, Hong Yang, one of the authors of this article, also submitted this novel, along with several other works, to the New Literature and Art Publishing House under the title "Air Route" for another separate publication. This novel was printed four times by different publishers almost at the same time.
    Identical examples are definitely not limited to these. Many publishing houses are publishing works that others have already published, and readers see many works with completely identical content in many different single-volume editions and collections. Who is reprinting whose book? It's hard to say. This reflects the current blind chaos and repetitive waste in editing and publishing work, resulting in a serious waste of manpower, financial resources, and paper in publishing and printing.
    Clearly, there should be a clear division of labor and necessary coordination mechanisms between editing and publishing departments and various publishing houses, and publishing regulations are needed to ensure uniformity and prevent these phenomena in editing and publishing work. The copyright and publishing rights of works and books should also be fully respected. The current phenomenon of "no copyright, repeated printing not investigated" in publishing work should be changed.

### 版权无有，屡印不究

    版权无有，屡印不究
    呼延豹
    早先出版的书，尾页上都要印上“版权所有，翻印必究”，或“有著作权，不准翻印”的字样，这是说书的著作权和版权，是属于书的作者或出版该书的书店的。只有得到了他们的许可，才能翻印出版。
    可是，这些字样在现在出版的书上，再也找不到了，这就是说，这样的法规，无形中被遗忘了。
    于是，许多编辑出版部门为了追求出版数量，就开始粗制滥造起来。许多已经出版了多次的作品，被无休止地编选着；许多内容雷同的书和作品，被改头换面无限制地翻印着。同一篇作品，你编选了我又编选，你出版了我又出版。许多编辑出版部门之间，缺乏明确的分工和必要的联系制度，那些被制定出来的出版法规形同虚设。在这样的情况下，一些发表出来的作品和编好了的书，谁愿意怎样编就怎样编，谁愿意怎样印就怎样印。作者是作品在外，随你编印去；编辑是只要有人出版，就随手拈来任意编选；出版社好像是只要有东西，管他重复与否，出了再说。
    且以李文元的小说“婚事”为例，1954年7月在“长江文艺”上发表以后，当时河南人民出版社就以“婚事”为书名出版了。1956年2月，中国作家协会编的“短篇小说选”，选入了这篇作品，印了一次。几乎是同时，“婚事”又选入中国青年出版社出版的小说选辑印了一次。1956年6月，作者又以“婚事”为书名，连同其他几篇小说交中国青年出版社又印了单行本。最近，河南省文联编选河南作者的作品，又将“婚事”选入该会编选的河南青年文学创作丛书“小黑”一书中，由河南人民出版社又出版了一次。一篇小说在短短两年多内，印了六次。
    例证之二，洪洋、刘岱合作的小说“伸向设计图的魔手”，1955年9月在“长江文艺”发表后，几乎是在同时，长江文艺出版社出版的“并非虚构的故事”，中国青年出版社出版的“伸向设计图的魔手”和作家出版社出版的“并非虚构的故事”三本书里都编选了这篇作品。最近，本文作者之一洪洋，又将这篇小说连同其他几篇作品，以“航线”为书名交新文艺出版社又印了一次单行本。这篇小说几乎是在同一的时间里，被不同的出版社印了四次。
    相同的例子决不止这些。许多出版社在出版着别人早已出版过的作品，读者在许多名目不同的单行本和选集中，看到了许多内容完全相同的作品。究竟是谁在翻印谁的书呢？很难说。这反映了目前编辑出版工作中的盲目混乱和重复浪费现象，结果就造成了出版印刷上人力、财力和纸张的严重浪费。
    很明显，编辑出版部门和各个出版社之间，应当有明确的分工和必要的联系制度，编辑出版工作上更需要统一性和制止这些现象的出版法规。作品和书的著作权和版权，也应当受到充分的尊重。应当改变目前出版工作上这种“版权无有，屡印不究”的现象。
