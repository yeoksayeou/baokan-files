Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, 27th - Nepalese Prime Minister Acharya said on the evening of the 26th that the more success Zhou Enlai and Nehru achieve in striving to fulfill the great task of realizing Asian-African solidarity, the more universal happiness will grow.

Prime Minister Acharya held a state banquet for Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Nepal. At the banquet, he also said that Nepal is located between two friendly countries, China and India. "India's respect for Nepalese sovereignty, cooperation, and assistance are well known. At the same time, China's respect for Nepalese sovereignty, and the Government of the People's Republic of China's sympathetic cooperation and assistance to Nepal are equally well known. During my travels in various parts of China, I could feel an undercurrent of sympathy and amity, and I could easily find it in the policies of your government. In fact, this is a source of great satisfaction to Nepal."

The Nepalese Prime Minister emphasized the importance of Asian-African solidarity. He said, "Wherever we gather together, or whenever we meet, we should first consider the great goal of our Asian-African solidarity, and we must put aside small, secondary, and divisive issues, in order to eliminate the feeling of difference between large and small countries."

He said that Nepal has made Panchsheel a part of its national policy. "When this principle is adopted by all Asian and African countries, we will firmly and finally achieve unity."

Acharya called Zhou Enlai his "personal friend" and "a close friend of Nepal on the other side of the Himalayas." He said that he believed that Zhou Enlai's visit to Nepal would greatly contribute to the development of friendship and goodwill between China and Nepal.

Premier Zhou Enlai said in his reply that when colonialists are unwilling to accept defeat and constantly attempt to invade and threaten the people of Asian and African countries, "it is even more necessary for our two countries to strengthen our cooperation in international affairs, and to work even harder with our great neighbor India and all peace-loving forces in the world to safeguard world peace."

He expressed his gratitude for the warm welcome he received. He said: "More than a thousand years ago, Chinese famous Buddhist scholars who visited Nepal praised Nepal in their writings as a country with beautiful scenery, excellent culture, and warm and friendly people. During this visit, we personally felt all of this."

He said that China and Nepal can learn from each other and help each other in many ways in their efforts to build their respective countries and promote the welfare of their people. "We fully sympathize with the efforts made by the Nepalese government and the Nepalese people to build their country, and we are willing to continue to provide support within our capacity."

High-ranking Nepalese military and government officials and members of the diplomatic corps in Nepal attended the banquet.

Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, 27th - Thirty thousand people in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, gathered at the Grand Review Ground on the 26th to hold a civic welcoming rally to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long.

When Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long stepped onto the rostrum, the participants applauded thunderously.

Premier Zhou Enlai walked onto the podium under the Bodhi tree. He was covered with roasted grains and cinnabar scattered by the welcomers, and wore a garland around his neck. He said to the citizens of Kathmandu, I hope that the friendship between China and Nepal will last as long as the Himalayas that connect our two countries. I hope that our two countries will always advance side by side in the cause of defending world peace and promoting international friendship. I hope that this friendship between our two countries will extend to all countries in Asia and Africa that desire peace and friendship, and to all countries in the world.

He said that the Chinese people have always believed that every country, regardless of size, is mutually equal; and has its own advantages worthy of learning by other countries. He mentioned the influence of Chinese scholars going to Nepal to seek knowledge and technology and the influence of Chinese culture in Nepal in history, and asked the two countries to learn from and help each other in construction.

He praised the freedom-loving and peace-loving Nepalese people and the Nepalese government's policies that are conducive to peace. He said that the Chinese people admire the just stand taken by Nepal on the issue of Egypt suffering aggression. He emphasized that Asian and African countries must strengthen their unity in order to defend the peace and security of this region of the world.

Referring to his visit to nine countries in Asia and Europe, he said that although these countries are different in political and social systems, in nationalities, beliefs and cultures, they all demand world peace and friendship between countries, and demand to develop their countries independently. This personal experience makes us believe that the cause of peace for which China and Nepal are jointly striving is a cause supported by the broad masses of people around the world and is bound to succeed.

Premier Zhou Enlai's speech was repeatedly interrupted by applause. When he finished his speech, the whole audience burst into prolonged and enthusiastic cheers.

Before Premier Zhou's speech, Hari Bhakta Shrestha, Chairman of the Kathmandu Municipal Authority, delivered a welcoming speech. He said that history has proved that there has been a close and friendly relationship between Nepal and China since ancient times. He said: "This historic visit of yours to our country has further strengthened this friendly relationship."

He said to Premier Zhou: "You are one of the founders of Panchsheel. Your great country is truly abiding by its principles. We are also a peace-loving nation. Our traditions and culture show this. The people of Nepal support your great country in upholding what Panchsheel provides to world peace and the suffering people."

When Premier Zhou Enlai was preparing to leave the venue, a large group of people squeezed to the side of the guests' cars. They stuffed carved mirror frames engraved with words praising China and Premier Zhou Enlai, as well as some personal items such as brass inkwells and bamboo pens, into Premier Zhou Enlai's hands. The mirror frames were gifts from some political parties and people's organizations.

On the way back to the guesthouse, many citizens of Kathmandu waved or clasped their hands to the Chinese guests to greet them.

Earlier that afternoon, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their entourage attended a reception held by the Indian Ambassador to Nepal at the Indian Embassy. King Mahendra and Queen of Nepal also attended the reception.

    中尼两国的友谊像喜马拉雅山一样天长地久
    阿查里雅首相设国宴招待周总理
    加德满都三万人举行大会热烈欢迎中国客人
    新华社加德满都27日电　尼泊尔首相阿查里雅26日晚上说，周恩来和尼赫鲁为了完成实现亚非团结的巨大任务而奋斗时取得多少成功，普遍的幸福也就会随着增长多少。
    阿查里雅首相为周恩来总理访问尼泊尔举行国宴。他在宴会上还说，尼泊尔位于两大友好国家——中国和印度之间。“印度对尼泊尔主权的尊重、合作和援助是大家都知道的。同时，中国对尼泊尔主权的尊重，中华人民共和国政府给予尼泊尔的同情的合作和援助也同样是大家都知道的。我在中国各地旅行期间能够感觉到一种同情和亲善的潜流，并且能够从贵国政府的政策中很容易地找到它。事实上，这是尼泊尔感到非常满意的源泉。”
    尼泊尔首相强调亚非团结的重要性。他说，“无论我们在什么地方聚集在一起，或者无论我们什么时候会面，我们应当首先考虑我们的亚非团结的伟大目标，我们必须把小的次要的有分歧的问题放在一边，以便消除大小国家之间有所不同的感觉。”
    他说，尼泊尔已经把潘查希拉定为它的国家政策的一部分。“当这种原则被所有亚非国家采纳时，我们就会牢固地和最后地达到团结。”
    阿查里雅把周恩来称为他“个人的朋友”和“尼泊尔在喜马拉雅山那一边的亲密的朋友”。他说，他相信，周恩来对尼泊尔的访问将大大有助于中国和尼泊尔之间的友谊和亲善精神的发展。
    周恩来总理致答词说，当殖民主义者不甘心失败并且不断想对亚洲和非洲各国人民进行侵略和威胁的时候，“我们两国更有必要在国际事务中加强我们的合作，并且更加努力和我们的伟大邻国印度以及世界上一切爱好和平力量一起来维护世界和平”。
    他表示感谢对他的热烈欢迎。他说：“在一千多年前访问尼泊尔的中国著名佛教学者在他们的著作中称赞尼泊尔是一个有美丽的风景、优秀的文化和热心而友好的人民的国家。在这次访问期间，我们亲身感受到这一切。”
    他说，中国和尼泊尔在努力建设它们各自的国家和促进它们人民的福利时在许多方面可以互相学习和互相帮助。“我们完全同情尼泊尔政府和尼泊尔人民为了建设他们的国家所作的努力，并且愿意在我们的能力范围之内继续提供支持。”
    出席宴会的有尼泊尔的高级军政官员和驻尼泊尔的外交使团人员。
    新华社加德满都27日电　尼泊尔首都加德满都三万人26日聚集在大检阅场上举行市民欢迎大会，欢迎周恩来总理和贺龙副总理。
    周恩来总理和贺龙副总理走上主席台的时候，参加大会的人报以雷鸣般的掌声。
    周恩来总理走上大菩提树下的讲坛。他遍身沾满了欢迎者所撒的炒过的谷物和朱砂，颈上戴着花环。他对加德满都市民说，我希望中国和尼泊尔的友谊像连接我们两国的喜马拉雅山一样天长地久。我希望我们两国将永远为了保卫世界和平和促进国际友谊的事业并肩前进。我希望我们两国间这种友谊会扩大到亚洲和非洲所有希望和平和友谊的国家，扩大到世界上所有的国家。
    他说，中国人民一向认为每个国家，不论大小都是互相平等的；并且有它自己的值得其他国家学习的优点。他提到在历史上中国学者到尼泊尔去寻求知识和技术以及中国文化在尼泊尔的影响，并且要求两国在建设中相互学习和帮助。
    他赞扬爱好自由和爱好和平的尼泊尔人民以及尼泊尔政府的有利于和平的政策。他说，尼泊尔在埃及遭受侵略的问题上所采取的正义立场使中国人民感到钦佩。他强调亚非国家必须加强团结以便保卫世界上这个地区的和平和安全。
    他在谈到他对亚洲和欧洲的九个国家的访问时说，虽然这些国家在政治和社会制度上，在民族、信仰和文化上都不相同，可是它们都要求世界和平和各国之间友好，要求独立地发展它们的国家。这种亲身经历使我们相信中国和尼泊尔共同为之奋斗的和平事业是得到全世界广大人民群众的支持的事业并且是一定会成功的事业。
    周恩来总理的讲话一再被掌声打断。当他结束他的讲话时，全场响起了长时间的热烈的欢呼声。
    在周总理讲话之前，加德满都市政机构主席哈里·布哈克塔·什雷斯塔曾致欢迎词。他说，历史证明了尼泊尔和中国之间从太古时代起就存在着亲密的友好关系。他说：“你对我们国家的这次历史性的访问进一步地加强了这种友好关系。”
    他对周总理说：“你是潘查希拉的创始人之一。你的伟大的国家正在真正地遵守着它的原则。我们也是一个爱好和平的民族。我们的传统和文化表明了这一点。尼泊尔人民支持你的伟大的国家维护潘查希拉对世界和平和受苦难的人民所提供的一切。”
    当周恩来总理准备离开会场的时候，大群的人挤到客人们的汽车旁边来。他们纷纷把刻有赞扬中国和周恩来总理的词句的雕刻镜框，以及一些个人用品像黄铜制墨水池和竹笔等塞到周恩来总理的手里。镜框是一些政党和人民团体赠送的礼物。
    在中国客人们回迎宾馆的路上，许多加德满都市民向他们挥手或者双手合十致意。
    在当天下午早些时候，周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和随行人员出席了印度驻尼泊尔大使在印度大使馆举行的招待会。尼泊尔国王马亨德拉和王后也参加了这次招待会。
