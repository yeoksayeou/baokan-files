Xinhua News Agency, January 12th: Most units of the state leadership organs, democratic parties, and central organs of people's organizations are actively conserving coal for heating to support industrial construction and the needs of urban and rural people.

Many units have thoroughly examined and analyzed the reasons for past coal waste, strengthened leadership and management, learned advanced experiences, improved operating techniques, and appropriately shortened firing times and lowered indoor temperatures, thus greatly reducing coal consumption. For example, the Anjie Building of the Ministry of Foreign Trade used to burn more than 26,000 jin of coal per day, but now it has been reduced to 15,000 jin, saving more than 11,000 jin of coal per day. The office buildings of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce have also saved about 2,600 to 2,700 jin of coal per day. The three high-pressure boilers used jointly by the Compilation and Publication Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Science Press, and other units saved 23% compared to the prescribed standards last year. Now, they are using methods such as pasting window seams to maintain indoor temperature, planning to reduce the burning of one more high-pressure boiler. According to their experiments, after pasting the window seams, the indoor temperature can be increased by more than one degree. In the past, air was released once an hour, but now it is released once every one and a half hours, thus shortening the firing time and reducing coal consumption.

After careful calculation, many units have returned unneeded coal reserves to the Coal Construction Company. The State Economic Commission has returned 1,800 tons of coal, and the Ministry of Food Industry has returned 1,000 tons of coal. The Ministry of Finance has exchanged 91 tons of Datong lump coal for 110 tons of lower-quality raw coal, and the Ministry of Food is now also making every effort to use inferior coal for heating.

According to the reporter's understanding, the central units still have the potential to save coal. As long as leading cadres pay attention to this work, improve the management system, and pay attention to absorbing advanced coal-burning experience, they can not only achieve the state's prescribed savings targets but also ensure the heating of staff.

### 中央机关许多单位节约取暖煤

    中央机关许多单位节约取暖煤
    新华社12日讯　国家领导机关各部门、各民主党派和人民团体中央机关的大多数单位都积极节约用煤，以支援工业建设和城乡人民的需要。
    许多单位深入地检查和分析了过去浪费用煤的原因，加强了领导和管理工作，学习先进经验，提高操作技术，再加上适当地缩短烧火时间和降低室内温度，因而大大地减少了耗煤的数量。如对外贸易部长安街大楼原来每天烧煤二万六千多斤，现在已经降到一万五千斤，每天节约煤一万一千多斤。中华全国供销合作总社和中华全国工商业联合会办公大楼，也已每天节约煤二千六、七百斤左右。中国科学院编译出版委员会、科学出版社等单位联合使用的三台高压锅炉，去年就比规定标准节约23％，现在他们又利用糊窗缝保持室内温度的办法，计划再减烧一台高压炉。据他们试验，糊窗缝以后，室内温度可以增加到一度以上，过去一小时放一次气，现在一个半小时放一次气，因此可以缩短烧火时间，降低耗煤数量。
    许多单位经过精打细算以后，纷纷把目前不需要的存煤退给煤建公司。国家经济委员会已退煤一千八百吨，食品工业部退煤一千吨。财政部将九十一吨大同块煤换成一百一十吨质量不好的元煤，粮食部现在也尽量利用次煤取暖。
    据记者了解，目前中央各单位都有节煤的潜力，只要领导干部重视这个工作，健全管理制度，注意吸取先进的烧煤经验，不仅可以达到国家规定的节约指标，同时也会保证工作人员的取暖。
