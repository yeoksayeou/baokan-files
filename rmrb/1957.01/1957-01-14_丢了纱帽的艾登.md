    Eden Loses His Hat
    Jin Feng
    January in London: bitterly cold days.
    Eden, hatless, appeared in London's shivering cold air.
    He had just concluded an emergency cabinet meeting. His expression was grave, his face full of dismay as he hurried out of the official residence at 10 Downing Street. People were astonished to see the Prime Minister, always so impeccably dressed and careful about his appearance, without a hat, wearing only a leather-collared overcoat, rushing by car to Buckingham Palace.
    Only two hours earlier, it had been announced that Queen Elizabeth, who was spending her Christmas holiday in Sandringham, had suddenly returned to London. The political atmosphere in London immediately became tense.
    Forty minutes later, Eden emerged from Buckingham Palace. Buckingham Palace and Eden simultaneously issued a statement announcing his resignation.
    Sir Evans and three other doctors issued a bulletin on Eden's health, stating: "We believe that his state of health has made him no longer able to bear the heavy responsibilities that the Prime Minister must bear."
    This was truly a grandly performed drama. However, no one cheered, and no one wept. As the hatless Eden stood outside Buckingham Palace, a small group of people watched him silently, and he waved goodbye to them coldly.
    The heavy hat of the British Prime Minister had finally fallen from his head, but his heart was by no means light. He looked at the cold eyes of the people, and he understood very well that he was a man abandoned by fate. Even more embarrassing was that at the moment of his stepping down, he still had to play a farce that everyone could see through at a glance.
    Only twenty-five days earlier, as he was about to leave the sunny coast of Jamaica, he had personally said: "I am returning now with great excitement and in good health." On the day he returned to London, he repeated: "I have returned full of energy!"
    Then, who would believe the stupid words that the doctors had solemnly fabricated?! This was just to make himself a laughingstock in front of the whole world once again. It seemed that even his last preparation to bear personal failure to save the glory of the empire was overshadowed!
    This was just like a picture of Chamberlain being driven out of office in 1940.
    How cruel fate is! Sixteen years ago, he had arrogantly mocked Chamberlain, stepping on Chamberlain's failure to climb his own ladder of success; and now, it was his turn to play the pitiful role of being mocked!
    However, this was not just his personal tragedy.
    On the eve of his departure for Jamaica, during the last cabinet squabble in Downing Street, he had already seen clearly his ominous future. However, he, first of all for the sake of the empire's interests, could not be reconciled to giving up. He left London with hope. He hoped that his departure would dilute some of the hatred people felt for him, he hoped that his Conservative Party could unite for the sake of the overall situation, and he hoped even more that allies across the ocean could give him a hand in his distress...
    Thus, in Jamaica, he released several trial balloons, requesting an invitation to the White House. He even went so far as to abandon the dignity of the empire, letting Deputy Prime Minister Butler say that the British Prime Minister was thinking of meeting with the American President. However, despite this, the White House still tightly gripped Britain's neck, ignoring him!
    He returned to London, putting on a brave face. The widely circulated "Daily Mirror" used most of the front page to publish a cartoon "Home Today" to welcome him. The cartoon showed a sunburnt Eden opening the front door of 10 Downing Street and finding his house in a mess, with a muddy "housekeeper" (a homophone for Deputy Prime Minister Butler's name) waiting for him.
    On December 17, he appeared in the House of Commons for the first time. Although the Conservative Party's diligent Heath hurriedly walked among the seats organizing a welcome, he was greeted by the opposition party's indifference and the Conservative Party's silence.
    That morning, gasoline rationing had just been implemented. Now, a storm of protests against rationing crashed down on Eden.
    The scathing questions about Anglo-American relations left Eden even more at a loss.
    Eden found that in the days since he had left London, although the British and French troops had withdrawn from Egypt, his position had not improved.
    In particular, the United States continued to pretend to be dissatisfied with the British and French invasion of Egypt, attempting to please Asian and African countries and severely undermine the British and French position in the Middle East, which caused Eden great distress. But wasn't it the United States that controlled 60% of the oil in the Middle East, and wasn't the power of the US Mediterranean Fleet three times that of the British fleet? And wasn't the largest air force base in the Middle East American? These were all the results that the United States had snatched from Britain in the past thirty years. However, the United States insisted on putting on a pose as a protector of colonial peoples, while assigning the dirty role of gendarme protecting American capital to Britain.
    And the United States wanted to mock Britain so ruthlessly. On the front page of the "Wall Street Journal" were these striking words: "John Bull must cling tightly to the hem of Uncle Sam's clothes. The stark truth is: without the United States, Britain cannot survive!" American newspapers also talked with relish about the New World (the United States) taking on the responsibility of the Old World (Britain), and brutally warned Britain to reduce its military and financial obligations overseas to adapt to its new role as a "second-rate power."
    Sadly, Eden was powerless to change this situation. Britain still had to beg the United States for dollars and oil. Britain's gold reserves were declining rapidly, falling to $1.572 billion in December, well below the dangerous point of $2 billion for a pound devaluation. It was only by drawing $561 million from the International Monetary Fund that the price of the pound was barely maintained. This almost wiped out all the efforts of the past decade! Poor John Bull had to cling to Uncle Sam's coattails! After sadly reviewing the rapidly decreasing gold reserves, Chancellor of the Exchequer Macmillan had to shamelessly ask the United States to waive the $82 million in interest due at the end of December, and also had to ask for new loans. But Britain already owed the United States $4.35 billion after the war, and had to repay the United States for fifty years from 1951, paying $169 million in principal and interest every year!
    And how cold-blooded were the oil tycoons of oil-rich Texas! They just leisurely smoked cigars, completely ignoring Europe's and Britain's urgent need for this lifeblood of industry. Their oil tankers just slowly set sail. They didn't care that British cars couldn't move, steel furnaces were cooling down, and machines were stagnating. They cared about getting more dollars before they would ship more oil!
    What kind of Christmas did the British people have last year! Bread, tea, and sugar were all rising in price, and the "Christmas meal" on many families' tables was clearly much smaller than the year before. The oil supply was cut off, coal prices rose, heating was reduced, and the Christmas fire was much dimmer. When they wanted to go to church to sing hymns or to congratulate relatives and friends, they found that transportation costs had risen or that they couldn't drive. And even more frightening was the specter of unemployment, looming over many families' Christmas tables!
    How could the British people not hate the Conservative government and its Prime Minister Eden for causing these disasters?
    Eden had just spent a dismal Christmas amid curses, and unexpectedly received a New Year's gift full of thorns. The specter of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" came from Washington. Since the beginning of December, people had been saying that Eisenhower was studying and formulating new foreign policies at his private villa in Augusta, Georgia. Dulles, who was recuperating in Key West at the time, was said to have often consulted with the President by phone. After this, when Dulles was ordered to attend the meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, although he repeatedly said that he wanted to "bury" the past "differences" between Britain and the United States and emphasized the unity of the Atlantic allies, he openly said that the United States wanted to reserve the right to take unilateral action in emergency situations. This laid the groundwork for the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to exclude Britain and France and act alone later. Then, American newspapers' talk about "filling" the "vacuum" in the Middle East became more and more frequent.
    Finally, Dulles summoned the British and French ambassadors to the United States to his State Department office and told them some information about the US government's plans to seek authorization from Congress. There was no consultation, and no formal memorandum, it was entirely like a boss dealing with his employees.
    Eden really felt as if a handful of bitter salt had been stuffed into his mouth. He looked more and more uneasily at the "Eisenhower Doctrine" that was about to be released. He clearly remembered that the "Truman Doctrine" of 1947 also used anti-communism as a signboard, but the result was to replace Britain's positions in Greece and Turkey, and drive Britain out of the Eastern Mediterranean. Next, it was Abadan in Iran. Not long ago, it was oil in Trinidad, and now, it was the prospect of Britain being driven out of the entire Middle East!
    The brutal Texan oil tycoons decided to stab him in the back again. American oil had just risen in price in November, and in January of this year, several large oil companies announced that they would raise crude oil prices again, by 25% to 40% per barrel.
    "Eden step down!" "We don't want such a disastrous government!" "Hold a general election immediately!" Domestic and foreign public opinion boiled again, and the fierce sound of iron eagles flapping their wings in Washington could be faintly heard.
    Eden's hat as Prime Minister, which he had accumulated for thirty-two years, was blown off in this way by the internal and external attacks, plus the storm of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" from across the Atlantic!
    The hatless Eden stood in London's shivering cold air...

    丢了纱帽的艾登
    金凤
    1月的伦敦，严寒的日子。
    不戴帽子的艾登出现在伦敦瑟缩的冷空气里。
    他刚刚开罢内阁紧急会议，神情严重，满脸凄惶，急匆匆从唐宁街十号的官邸里出来。人们不禁惊异地看到这位一向衣冠楚楚、注意修饰的首相，竟然帽子也不戴，只穿了一件皮领大衣，趁车径赴白金汉宫去。
    而两个钟头以前，这里才刚刚宣布正在桑德林汉度圣诞节假期的伊丽莎白女王，突然返回伦敦。伦敦的政治空气陡然紧张起来。
    四十分钟以后，艾登从白金汉宫出来。白金汉宫和艾登同时发表了他辞职的声明。
    伊凡斯爵士和其他三位医生发表了艾登健康情况的公报：“我们认为，他的健康状况已使他不再能负担首相所必须负担的沉重责任。”
    这真是一幕隆重扮演的戏剧。但是，没有人欢呼，也没有人流泪。当丢了纱帽的艾登站在白金汉宫外面，一小群人沉默地看着他，他冷冷地向他们挥手告别。
    大英帝国首相这顶沉重的帽子终于从他头上落下来了，但是他的心头绝不轻松。他看着人们冷冷的眼光，他很明白自己是被命运所抛弃的人了。更难堪的是在他下台的一刹那，他还不得不扮演着叫人一眼就看穿的笑剧。
    仅仅二十五天以前，当他将要离开充满阳光的牙买加海岸，他还亲口说过：“现在我回去是带着非常兴奋的心情和健康的身体。”在回到伦敦那天，他又重复说着：“我已经精神充沛地回来了！”
    那末，还有谁会相信那些医生一本正经编排的蠢话？！这不过是使自己在全世界面前再一次被当作笑料而已。这似乎连带使他最后准备承担个人的失败来拯救帝国的光荣也黯然失色了！
    这宛然是一幅1940年张伯伦被赶下台的图画。
    命运多么残酷！16年以前，他还趾高气扬地嘲笑着张伯伦，脚踩着张伯伦的失败爬上自己成功的阶梯；而现在，竟然轮到自己扮演被嘲弄的可怜的角色！
    但是，事情不仅仅是他个人的悲剧。
    在他去牙买加的前夕，在唐宁街最后一次内阁的争吵声中，他本来对于他的不祥的前途已经看清楚了。但是，他，首先是为了帝国的利益，毕竟还不能就此甘心。他带着希望离开伦敦。他希望他的离开会冲淡一些人们对他的憎恨，他希望他的保守党能顾全大局团结起来，他更希望大洋彼岸的盟友在他这样的患难之中多少能够拉他一把……
    于是，在牙买加，他几次放出空气要求得到一份白宫的请帖。甚至他都不惜丢开帝国的尊严，让代理首相巴特勒说出英国首相惦记着要会见美国总统的话来。但是，尽管如此，白宫居然还是紧紧地掐住英国的脖子，不理不睬！
    他强打精神回到伦敦。大量发行的“每日镜报”在第一版上用了大部分篇幅登了一幅漫画“今日的家”来欢迎他。漫画上画着被太阳晒黑了的艾登打开唐宁街十号的前门，发现他的家里乱七八糟，一个拖泥带水的“管家”（代理首相巴特勒的同音字）正在等待着他。
    12月17日，他第一次在下院出现。尽管保守党的殷勤的希恩匆忙地在议员席中走来走去组织着欢迎，但是迎接他的还是反对党的冷漠和保守党的沉默。
    这一天早晨刚刚实行了汽油配给制。现在，暴风雨般的对于配给制的抗议兜头兜脑迎着艾登袭来。
    对于英美关系的刻薄的问题，更使艾登手足无措。
    艾登发觉，在他离开伦敦的这些日子里，虽然已经从埃及撤退了英法军队，却并没有使自己的地位有所改善。
    特别是美国居然继续装做不满英法侵略埃及的样子，企图讨好亚非国家，狠狠打击英法在中东的地位，使艾登深感苦恼。但是，难道不是美国控制了中东60％的石油，不是美国驻地中海舰队的威力三倍于英国舰队的威力？中东土地上最大的空军基地又难道不是美国的？这些都是三十年来美国从英国手中抢去的成果。但是，美国偏生还在装出一付殖民地人民保护者的姿态，而把保护美国资本的宪兵这个肮脏的角色派给英国担当。
    而美国还要这样无情地嘲笑英国。在“华尔街日报”第一页的头条，登载着这些触目惊心的字句，“约翰牛必须深深扯住山姆大叔衣服的下摆。赤裸裸的事实是：没有美国，英国就不能生存！”美国报纸还津津有味地谈论着新世界（美国）要担当旧世界（英国）的责任，并且以暴发户的粗暴告诫着英国必须消减在海外的军事和财政义务，以适应它作为一个“二等强国”的新作用。
    可悲的是，艾登无力改变这种局势。英国还不得不向美国乞求美元和石油。英国的黄金储备在迅速下降，12月竟降到十五亿七千二百万美元，大大低于英镑贬值的危险点二十亿美元。只靠了从国际货币基金里提出来的五亿六千一百万美元，才勉强维持了英镑的价格。这几乎把过去十年的努力全化为乌有！可怜的约翰牛不得不扯住山姆大叔的衣摆！财政大臣麦克米伦在凄然回顾急剧减少的黄金储备以后不得不腆颜要求美国免去12月底到期的利息八千二百万美元，而且还必须要求新的贷款。但是英国在战后已经欠了美国四十三亿五千万美元，从1951年起要还美国五十年才能还清，每年本息就要付一亿六千九百万美元！
    而盛产石油的得克萨斯的老板们又是何等冷酷啊！他们只是悠闲地吸着雪茄，全然不顾欧洲和英国急于得到这工业的活命之血。他们的运油船只是慢吞吞地开出来。他们不管英国的汽车不能走动了，炼钢炉在冷却下来，机器的运转停滞了。他们关心的是要得到更多美元，才会运送更多石油！
    英国人去年过的是怎样的圣诞节啊！面包、茶叶和糖都在涨价，许多家庭摆在桌上的“圣诞餐”显然比前年小气许多。石油来源断绝，煤涨价了，暖气减少了，圣诞节的炉火黯淡许多。当他们要到教堂去唱赞美诗或是去亲友家道贺时，他们又发现交通费涨了或是有车开不得。而更可怕的是失业的魔影，隐隐地笼罩在许多家庭的圣诞餐桌上！
    英国人怎么能够不切齿痛恨造成这些灾难的保守党政府和它的首相艾登呢？
    艾登刚刚在咀咒声中度过了凄凉的圣诞节，又料想不到地收到了一份满带荆棘的新年礼物。从华盛顿传来了“艾森豪威尔主义”的魔影。从12月初起，人们就在传说着艾森豪威尔在乔治亚州奥古斯大他的私人别墅里，正在研究制定着新的外交政策。那时在基韦斯特休养的杜勒斯，据说时常用电话和总统商谈着。这以后，杜勒斯奉命参加北大西洋公约组织理事会会议时，虽然口口声声要“埋葬”掉英美过去的“分歧”，强调大西洋盟友的团结一致。但是，他却公然说美国要保留在紧急情况下单独采取行动的权利。这就为以后的排斥英法而单独干的“艾森豪威尔主义”留下伏笔。接着，美国报纸关于“填补”中东“真空”的言论愈来愈多了。
    终于，杜勒斯在他的国务卿办公室召见了英法驻美大使，告诉他们一点关于美国政府想要求国会授权的打算的情报。没有任何磋商，也没有正式的备忘录，全然是老板对付伙计的做法。
    艾登真觉得仿佛满嘴塞进了一大把苦盐。他愈来愈不安地侧目注视着这就要出笼的“艾森豪威尔主义”。他很清楚地记得，1947年的“杜鲁门主义”，也是以反共作招牌，结果是取代了英国在希腊、土耳其的阵地，把英国逐出了东地中海。接着，是伊朗的阿巴丹。不久以前，特立尼达的石油，现在，则是英国被赶出整个中东的前途了！
    得克萨斯州的粗暴的石油老板又决定再从背后刺进一刀。美国石油刚在11月涨价，今年1月，几个大石油公司又纷纷宣布提高原油价格，每桶涨25％到40％。
    “艾登下台！”“我们不要这样的灾难性的政府！”“迅速举行大选！”国内外的舆论又一次沸腾起来，其中隐隐听得出华盛顿铁鹰扑翅的凶戾的声音。
    艾登三十二年积攒得来的首相的帽子，就在这样的内外夹攻，加上最后这阵大西洋上传来的“艾森豪威尔主义”的风暴下吹落了！
    不戴帽子的艾登伫立在伦敦瑟缩的冷空气里……
