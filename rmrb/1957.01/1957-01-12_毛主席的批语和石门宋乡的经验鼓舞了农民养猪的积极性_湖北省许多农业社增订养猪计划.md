Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 11th. After studying Chairman Mao's instructions on the pig raising experience of the Shimen Songxiang Agricultural Cooperative in Yanggu County, Shandong Province, rural cadres and members of agricultural production cooperatives in Hubei Province have generally paid more attention to pig raising, and many agricultural cooperatives have revised their pig raising plans.

The Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a notice to its subordinate county committees, calling on cadres in counties, districts, townships, and cooperatives to earnestly study Chairman Mao's instructions and the pig raising experience of the Shimen Songxiang Agricultural Cooperative. In addition to helping agricultural cooperatives revise pig raising plans and measures, the Sui County Committee also sent one pig raising technical cadre, one model farmer in pig raising, and one township branch secretary to Yanggu County Shimen Songxiang to visit and learn from their experience in pig raising.

After studying, the Xinchun Agricultural Cooperative in Dadun Township, Huangpi County, believes that each household in the cooperative can raise two pigs in 1957. Last year, the cooperative raised 743 pigs, with an average of more than two pigs per household for all 354 households in the cooperative. The cooperative originally had 70 large sows and 4 boars. Now, they plan to select another 80 piglets from the existing 210 piglets to be used as sows and 3 as boars. It is estimated that 3,270 pigs (including existing pigs) can be bred this year. In order to solve the problem of feed for large-scale pig raising and reduce pig disease mortality, the cooperative has mobilized its members to find ways to identify more than 20 kinds of feed sources, and decided to adopt methods such as local breeding and strengthening feeding management to prevent pig diseases.

The Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative in Zhangjiawan Township, Macheng County, has already achieved one pig per household. Not long ago, when the cooperative discussed the 1957 pig raising plan, many members said with complacency: It is not easy to have one pig per household, and it would be difficult to develop further. Just at this time, the newspaper carrying Chairman Mao's instructions and the pig raising experience of Shimen Songxiang was delivered, and the cooperative cadres immediately organized the members to study it. The members were greatly encouraged and overcame their complacency. They studied the specific conditions of the cooperative and ensured that each household would raise at least two pigs in 1957.

    毛主席的批语和石门宋乡的经验鼓舞了农民养猪的积极性
    湖北省许多农业社增订养猪计划
    新华社武汉11日电　湖北省各地农村干部和农业生产合作社社员，学习了毛主席对山东省阳谷县石门宋乡农业社养猪经验的批语以后，普遍对养猪工作重视起来，许多农业社重新修订了他们的养猪计划。
    中共襄阳地委向所属各县委发出通知，号召各县、区、乡、社的干部，认真地学习毛主席的批语和石门宋乡农业社养猪的经验。随县县委除了帮助各地农业社修订养猪计划和措施以外，还派了养猪技术干部、农民养猪模范和乡的支部书记各一人，到阳谷县石门宋乡访师拜友，学习养猪经验。
    黄陂县大墩乡新春农业社经过学习以后，认为1957年全社能够做到每人养两头猪。这个社去年养猪七百四十三头，全社三百五十四户平均每户养猪两头以上。这个社里原有七十头大母猪和四头公猪，现在准备从现有的二百一十头仔猪中再挑选八十头作母猪，三头作种公猪，预计今年就可以繁殖到三千二百七十头猪（包括现有的猪）。为了解决大量养猪的饲料问题和减少猪的疫病死亡，这个社经过发动社员想办法，找出了二十多种饲料来源，并且决定采取就地繁殖和加强饲养管理等办法，来防止猪的疫病。
    麻城县张家垸乡新华农业社已经做到一户一头猪。不久以前，社里讨论1957年养猪计划，许多社员自满地说：每户一头猪已经不简单了，再要发展就困难啦。正在这个时候，刊载毛主席的批语和石门宋乡养猪经验的报纸送到了，社干部马上组织社员学习。社员们受到很大的鼓舞，克服了自满思想。他们研究了本社的具体条件，保证在1957年内每户至少要养两头猪。
