Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 1st. The Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, in its New Year's message for 1957 released yesterday, proposed the tasks for the new year, stating that it is necessary to consolidate and develop the victories gained in democratic life in 1956, and to mobilize all forces to promote and assist the Sastroamidjojo government to more conscientiously fulfill the political program that has been adopted by the parliament.

The message mentioned that in 1956, Indonesia's international status was increasingly consolidated, and Indonesia's national independence was also consolidated. At the same time, 1956 was a year in which democratic life gained more concrete form in Indonesia. In this year, the strength and momentum of domestic counter-revolutionary elements further declined. The message mentioned in this regard the bankruptcy of the coup conspiracy of former Army Deputy Chief of Staff Lubis, the resignation of Vice President Hatta, and the failure of the military rebellion of former First Military District Commander Simbolon, and others.

The message pointed out that in order for the government to implement its political program well, the Indonesian Communist Party, together with the people, demands that those ministers who undermine the implementation of the government program must be removed from the cabinet, and the same steps must be taken against those bureau chiefs and other high officials who undermine the implementation of the central government's program, and the entire cabinet should not be sacrificed for the sake of these few individuals.

The message called on the Indonesian people to consolidate national independence, expand democracy, and develop the struggle to improve living standards and strive for peace, friendship, and goodwill among all nations. Support, promote, and assist the authorities to resolve the Central Sumatra and North Sumatra incidents quickly and decisively, and continue to eliminate the "Islamic Army," the "Islamic State Movement," and other anti-people illegal armed groups.

The message concluded by saying that in order to avoid the massacres that occurred during the "Malifet Incident," every conspiracy to bring Hatta into the government must be opposed.

    印度尼西亚共产党新年献词
    号召巩固独立扩大民主支持政府肃清叛乱集团
    新华社雅加达1日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会在昨天发表的1957年新年献词中，提出新的一年的任务说，必须巩固和发展1956年中的民主生活所得到的胜利，动员一切力量推动和协助沙斯特罗阿米佐约政府更加认真地来履行已经由国会通过的政纲。
    献词提到在1956年中，印度尼西亚的国际地位日益巩固，印度尼西亚的民族独立也巩固了。同时，1956年是民主生活在印度尼西亚获得更具体的形式的一年。这一年中，国内反革命分子的力量和声势更加衰落了。献词在这方面提到了前陆军副参谋长卢比斯政变阴谋的破产、副总统哈达的下台和前第一军区司令西姆波朗的军事叛乱的失败等。
    献词指出，为了使政府能够良好地执行它的政纲，印度尼西亚共产党同人民一道要求必须把那些破坏执行政府纲领的部长们开除出内阁，对那些破坏中央政府纲领的执行工作的各局局长及其他大员也必须采取同样步骤，不要让整个内阁成为这几个人的牺牲品。
    献词号召印度尼西亚人民巩固民族独立，扩大民主，发展争取改善生活、争取和平、友谊和各民族间的亲善的斗争。支持、推动并协助当局迅速而断然地解决中苏门答腊和北苏门答腊事件，继续肃清“伊斯兰教军”、“伊斯兰教国运动”及其他反人民的非法武装集团。
    献词最后说，为了避免像“茉莉芬事件”发生时期那样的大屠杀，必须反对企图把哈达拉入政府的每一个阴谋。
