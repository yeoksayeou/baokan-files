    本报讯　题材广泛和形式多样的新年画，从去年12月份起在全国各地已陆续上市。新华书店各地分支店早在10、11月份内，就同当地公私合营书店、供销社和合作商店等，联系和研究了年画的转批和推销工作。
    黑龙江省安达县老虎岗乡新华供销社于12月7日从新华书店批回年画后，当晚就拆包、整理，并挂出年画画样。截至12月12日止，该社共销出各种年画一百零四张。辽宁省海城县的文化用品商店，于12月5日搭了一个画棚出售年画，当天就卖出四百余张。
    陕西、河南、江西和内蒙古等地，也在12月初开始供应年画。河南嵩县、南乐、郸城等地还出现了卖年画的摊贩。江西临川腾桥供销社还配合物资交流会，销出各种年画三百多张。
    为了扩大年画的宣传，听取群众对年画品种、内容和发行工作的意见，不少地区的新华书店还举办了年画展览。　　　　　（志）
