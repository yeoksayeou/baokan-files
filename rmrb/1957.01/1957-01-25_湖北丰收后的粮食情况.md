    Grain Situation in Hubei After the Bumper Harvest
    Jin Chao
    Hubei Province had a great agricultural harvest in 1956, with the total grain output estimated to be no less than 21 billion jin. Even with this lowest estimate, the output increased by 11.7% compared to 1955, significantly exceeding the 1957 grain production target. With the bumper grain harvest, the state's requisition task remains based on the "Three Fixes" (fixed output, fixed purchase, fixed sales), and the unified purchase task has not been increased due to the increase in grain output. Therefore, the grain situation in rural areas has undergone new changes compared to previous years. In order to grasp the changes in rural grain situation and facilitate grain work, the Hubei Provincial Grain Department conducted typical surveys in several representative agricultural production cooperatives in counties such as Anlu, Sui, Zaoyang, Jiangling, Tianmen, and Xiangyang. According to the survey data, these changes are as follows:
    The first change: Rural grain unified purchase and sales are carried out on a cooperative basis, with surpluses and shortages being adjusted within the cooperative. Therefore, in surplus grain cooperatives and self-sufficient grain cooperatives in rural areas, grain-deficient households have been basically eliminated. During the "Three Fixes" for grain in 1955, some members of these cooperatives were short of grain. For example, the Red Star Cooperative in Xiangyang County had grain-deficient households short of more than 17,500 jin; the Xuguang Cooperative in Sui County had grain-deficient households short of more than 19,600 jin. After the surplus and shortage adjustment was carried out within the cooperative for these grain-deficient households, the state used the grain that should have been purchased as supply grain within the cooperative, and did not make unified purchases. Therefore, in grain-producing areas, the elimination of grain-deficient households has been basically achieved within surplus grain cooperatives and self-sufficient grain cooperatives.
    The second change: According to the principle of appropriately raising living standards on the basis of developing production, the necessary retained grain for farmers has generally increased compared to the standards stipulated during the "Three Fixes." For example:
Agricultural Cooperative Name	Average Grain Retained per Person (jin)	% Increase in Grain Retained in 1956 Compared to Three Fixes		Grain Retained as Stipulated by Three Fixes	Grain Retained in 1956
Anlu County Sanba Cooperative	548		650		18.61
Sui County Xuguang Cooperative	566		605		6.89
Jiangling County Xinyang Cooperative	511		791		54.8
Tianmen County Xinhua Ninth Cooperative	609		642		5.42
    Judging from the average amount of grain retained per person in the above agricultural cooperatives, the highest grain retention increased by 54.8% compared to the "Three Fixes," and the lowest also increased by more than 5%. In some high-yield areas of the province, the grain retained per person is as high as about 1,000 jin, which is a much larger proportion. The grain retained by each cooperative member and individual farmer is sufficient for consumption, completely changing the past situation of tight grain retention.
    The third change: With the bumper grain harvest, the state's requisition task has not been increased, therefore, there is more social surplus grain in rural areas than in previous years. According to surveys, agricultural production cooperatives currently have a large amount of surplus grain in addition to completing the state's requisition task and retaining sufficient grain for the necessary use of cooperative members. For example:
Agricultural Cooperative Name	Social Surplus Grain After Unified Purchase (jin)		Quantity		Percentage of Output	% Increase in 1956 Compared to Three Fixes
Anlu County Jiefang Cooperative	119,511	23		582.96
Jiangling County Xinyang Cooperative	241,917	16.62		283.75
Zaoyang County Liaoyuan Cooperative	137,785	8.24		488.64
Zaoyang County Fengshou Cooperative	153,897	13.35		788.87
    Judging from the amount of social surplus grain in the above agricultural production cooperatives, the lowest cooperative has more than 100,000 jin. The province has 30,000 agricultural cooperatives, and after excluding grain-deficient cooperatives and self-sufficient cooperatives which account for about half, there are about 15,000 agricultural cooperatives with surplus grain. If each surplus grain cooperative has 100,000 jin of social surplus grain, the province's social surplus grain would be about 1.5 billion jin.
    The reason why Hubei Province still has a large amount of social surplus grain after completing the state's requisition task and retaining sufficient grain for the necessary use of cooperative members and individual farmers is that, on the one hand, grain production has increased, and on the other hand, the harvest season was earlier. Before the State Council issued the "Regulations on Unified Purchase and Sales of Grain by Agricultural Production Cooperatives," the unified purchase task was determined according to the fixed purchase amount. It was not possible to include the 40% of increased grain production to support disaster areas within the unified purchase task according to the new regulations. Therefore, the remaining grain after Hubei Province's unified grain purchase cannot all be counted as social surplus grain. Based on this situation, how to correctly handle the province's existing social surplus grain has become a very important issue.
    In order to support disaster areas, for agricultural production cooperatives to store grain in bumper harvest years, and to further improve the lives of cooperative members and individual farmers, the handling principle for social surplus grain should adopt the following methods: the state continues to purchase a portion through the market; agricultural cooperatives store a portion; and the remainder is distributed to cooperative members for free use. Facts have proven that this method can be accepted by agricultural cooperatives and individual farmers. Currently, many agricultural cooperatives throughout the province are selling extra surplus grain to the state. For example, after the Hongping, Hongdong, and Anbei cooperatives in Liulin Township, Hong'an County, put forward the slogan "Sell more increased grain to support disaster areas" to their members, they sold 220,000 jin of increased grain in just three days. Also, by December 9th of last year, the province had purchased more than 230 million jin of increased grain through the market; at the same time, the national grain market is also very active. Since November of last year, the daily amount of grain on the market has reached tens of millions of jin, of which the state's purchase amount has averaged more than 10 million jin per day. However, judging from the province's situation, relevant departments have not conducted ideological education among the broad masses of cooperative members and individual farmers on the correct handling of social surplus grain, and therefore, there is a serious phenomenon of wasting grain in some areas. The most prominent waste is using a large amount of grain to brew wine and boil sugar. For example, Lengdian Township in Huangpi County opened seven sugar workshops, requiring 49,000 jin of rice as raw materials per month; after Beidou Branch of Tancun Township in Yingshan County used up its surplus grain for boiling sugar, it also requested the state to supply raw materials; Tongxin Cooperative in Tingsiqiao Township, Xianning County, had 20 cooperative members fry 2,000 jin of puffed rice at one time. Similar situations are still developing in other areas. If they are not stopped, the state's task of purchasing increased grain through the market cannot be completed, and at the same time, the agricultural cooperatives' grain storage may also fall through. In this way, once a disaster occurs, a tense situation may arise again in the grain issue. Therefore, educating farmers to save grain and stopping the phenomenon of wasting grain is a political task that cannot be ignored at present.
    Secondly, judging from the changes in the rural grain situation, the surplus grain cooperatives and self-sufficient cooperatives in grain-producing areas have no grain shortage problems because the surplus and shortage were balanced within the cooperative during unified purchase. According to the amount of grain owned, grain-deficient cooperatives or grain-deficient households generally only lack one month's grain, or two months at most. Based on this situation, from the grain harvest period in 1956 to March 1957, grain-producing areas are all grain-rich seasons. According to the principle of "eat your own first, then the state's," grain supply departments should basically achieve not selling grain or selling less grain during this period. However, according to the actual sales volume, the five months from July to November 1956, on the contrary, sold 40.5% more than the same period in 1955. This shows that Hubei Province did not make due control and adjustments to the original supply plan in the previous stage of rural grain supply based on the changes in the rural grain situation. Currently, many areas are rectifying rural grain supply, verifying the supply amount for grain-deficient cooperatives or households, and issuing supply certificates to households, indicating when they are short of grain and how much they lack, and supplying grain based on the certificates. It is estimated that as a result of this control, grain generally will not be sold in grain-producing areas before February 1957. In this way, the grain supply area and supply amount for grain-deficient cooperatives or households in grain-producing areas have been greatly reduced compared to previous years. In the future, the focus of rural grain supply work lies in ensuring the supply to technical crop areas. According to typical surveys, the planting area of technical crops in Hubei Province in 1956 was larger than the "Three Fixes," and the grain planting area decreased relatively. For example, the planting area of technical crops in Xinhua Ninth Cooperative in Tianmen County in 1956 increased by 26.72% compared to the "Three Fixes," and grain production therefore decreased by 25.97%. This change will also inevitably cause a great change in the surplus and shortage situation, from a surplus of 90,140 jin in the "Three Fixes" to a shortage of 118,400 jin. In order to do a good job in grain supply in technical crop areas, we should also grasp the actual situation through the work of verifying the supply amount, so as to carry out grain allocation and processing and ensure supply. In addition, for agricultural cooperatives that have reduced harvests due to disasters and are short of grain, we must ensure supply in both grain-producing areas and technical crop areas, because after agricultural cooperation, grain figures are all "on the table," unlike when farmers operated separately in the past and may have retained black grain; if supply is not guaranteed, problems may occur in these areas. Grain departments should have sufficient understanding of this point, and should not be careless because of the bumper grain harvest.

    湖北丰收后的粮食情况
    金超
    湖北省1956年农业大丰收，粮食总产量估计最低不少于二百一十亿斤。就以这个最低的估产数计算，产量比1955年增长11.7％，大大超过1957年粮食生产指标。粮食丰收了，而国家征购任务仍然以三定为基础，没有因为粮食产量的增加而增大统购任务，因此，农村粮食情况较往年有了新的变化。为了掌握农村粮食的变化情况，便于做好粮食工作，湖北省粮食部门曾在安陆、随县、枣阳、江陵、天门、襄阳等县中选择了几个有代表性的农业生产合作社作了典型调查。从调查资料看，这些变化是这样的：
    第一个变化：农村粮食统购统销以社为单位进行，在社内自行调剂余缺。因此，在农村中的余粮社和足粮社内，基本上消灭了缺粮户。在1955年粮食“三定”的时候，这些社里有些社员是缺粮的。例如：襄阳县红星社的缺粮户计缺粮一万七千五百多斤；随县旭光社缺粮户计缺粮一万九千六百多斤。这些缺粮户的缺粮数，在社内进行了余缺调剂以后，国家把这些应购的粮食就在社内抵作了供应粮，没有统购。因此，在粮产区余粮社和足粮社内基本上做到了消灭缺粮户。
    第二个变化：根据在发展生产基础上适当提高生活水平的原则，农民的必需留用粮较“三定”时规定的标准普遍提高了。例如：农业社名称	平均每人留粮数（斤）	     1956年留粮数较三定留粮数增加％		三定规定留粮数	1956年留粮数   安陆县三八社	548		650		18.61随县旭光社	566		605		6.89江陵县新阳社	511		791		54.8天门县新华九社	609		642		5.42从上述几个农业社每人平均的留粮数量看，留粮最高的较“三定”时提高了54.8％，最低的也提高了5％以上。而该省有些丰产区每人留用粮有高达一千斤左右的，比这个比例还要大得多。每个社员和个体农民留用的粮食是足够食用的，完全改变了过去留粮偏紧的状况。
    第三个变化：粮食丰收了，国家征购任务并没有加重，因此，农村的社会余粮较历年都多。根据调查，目前农业生产合作社除了完成国家的征购任务和留足社员的必需用粮外，尚有大批剩余粮食。例如：农业社名称	统购后的社会余粮（斤）		数量		占产量％	1956年较三定增加％安陆县解放社	119，511	23		582.96江陵县新阳社	241，917	16.62		283.75枣阳县燎原社	137，785	8.24		488.64枣阳县丰收社	153，897	13.35		788.87从上述几个农业生产合作社的社会余粮数量看，最低的社也在十万斤以上。全省有三万个农业社，除去缺粮的社和足粮的社大约占二分之一外，还有约一万五千个农业社是有余粮的。如果每个余粮社的社会余粮以十万斤计算，全省的社会余粮就有十五亿斤左右。
    湖北省之所以在完成国家征购任务和留足社员和个体农民的必需用粮后尚有大批社会余粮，一方面是由于粮食增产了，另一方面是由于收割季节较早，在国务院“关于农业生产合作社粮食统购统销办法”颁发前，已按照定购数确定了统购任务，未能根据新的办法把支援灾区统购增产粮40％这部分布置在统购任务之内。因此，湖北省统购粮食以后的剩余粮食，还不能全部算为社会余粮。根据这个情况，如何对全省现有的社会余粮作正确的处理，就成了一个十分重要的问题。
    为了支援灾区，为了农业生产合作社能够在丰收年储积粮食和进一步改善社员和个体农民生活的需要，对社会余粮的处理原则应该采取这样的办法：国家通过市场继续收购一部分；农业社储积一部分；其余的分给社员自由使用。事实证明这个办法能够为农业社和个体农民所接受。目前全省许多农业社正在把额外的余粮卖给国家。如红安县柳林乡的红坪、红东、安北等三十五个农业社向社员们提出“多卖增产粮支援灾区”的口号以后，仅三天时间，就卖出增产粮二十二万斤。又，到去年12月9日止，全省通过市场已经收购了增产粮二亿三千多万斤；同时，国家粮食市场也很活跃，自去年11月份以来每日粮食上市量达数千万斤，其中国家收购数每日平均达千万斤以上。但是从全省情况看，有关部门对正确处理社会余粮问题，还没有在广大社员和个体农民中进行思想教育，因而在某些地区严重地存在着浪费粮食的现象。最突出的浪费是用大批的粮食煮酒熬糖。如黄陂县冷店乡开了七个糖坊，一个月需要四万九千斤大米作原料；应山县檀山乡北斗分社熬糖把余粮用光后，还要求国家供应原料；咸宁县汀泗桥乡同心社有二十户社员一次炸了二千斤米泡。类似的情况在其它地区还在发展，如果不加制止，国家通过市场的收购增产粮的任务就不能完成，同时，农业社的粮食储积也有落空的可能。这样，一旦遇到灾害，在粮食问题上就又可能出现紧张的局面。因此，对农民进行节约粮食的教育，制止浪费粮食的现象，在当前是不容忽视的政治任务。
    其次，从农村的粮食变化情况看，粮产区的余粮社、自足社由于在统购的时候社内进行了余缺平衡，已经没有了缺粮问题。缺粮社或缺粮户根据粮食占有量看，一般都只缺一个月的粮食，多则两个月。根据这个情况，从1956年粮食收割时期起到1957年3月份的时间内，粮产区都是有粮季节。按照“先吃自己的，后吃国家的”原则，粮食供应部门在这段时间内应该基本上做到不销粮食或少销粮食。但是，从实际销量检查，1956年7月至11月的五个月，反倒比1955年同期多销了40.5％。这说明湖北省前段在农村粮食供应上没有根据农村粮食变化情况对原供应计划作应有的控制和调整。目前不少地区对农村粮食供应正在进行整顿，对缺粮社或户核实供应量，并按户发给供应证，在证上注明什么时候缺粮，缺多少，凭证供应。据估计，这样控制的结果，在粮产区一般在1957年2月份以前可以不销粮食。这样，粮产区对缺粮社或户的粮食供应面和供应量都较往年大大地减少了。今后农村粮食供应工作的重点在于保证对技术作物区的供应。根据典型调查，湖北省技术作物区1956年比“三定”时的技术作物播种面积扩大了，粮食播种面积相对地减少了。如天门县新华九社1956年技术作物播种面积比“三定”数扩大了26.72％，粮食因此减产25.97％。这个变化也必然使粮食余、缺情况起了很大变化，由“三定”的余粮九万零一百四十多斤，变为缺粮十一万八千四百多斤。为了做好技术作物区的粮食供应，还应该通过核实供应量工作，把实际情况掌握起来，以便进行粮食的调拨和加工，保证供应。此外，对于因灾歉收而缺粮的农业社，无论在粮产区和技术作物区都要切实保证供应，因为农业合作化以后，粮食数字都“摆在桌面上”，不像过去分散经营的时候农民有可能留有黑粮；如果不保证供应，这些地区就有可能发生问题。粮食部门应该对这点有足够的认识，切不要因为粮食丰收了而麻痹大意。
