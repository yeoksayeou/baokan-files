Xinhua News Agency, Nangal, January 1st: Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and Indian Prime Minister Nehru held a three-hour meeting yesterday afternoon in the Nangal dam area.

The two Prime Ministers held closed-door talks in a small glass-windowed room outside the Sutlej Mansion on the left bank of the Sutlej River, in a very quiet setting, with the gentle river flowing beside them.

In the joyful atmosphere of the New Year's Eve, both Prime Ministers looked very happy.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 1st: Prime Minister Nehru hosted a luncheon for Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long at the Prime Minister's residence today. The Dalai Lama and Bainqen Erdini also attended the luncheon. Others present included Vice President Radhakrishnan, Indian Ambassador to China R.K. Nehru and his wife, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, and Foreign Secretary Byle. Chinese Ambassador to India Pan Zili and his wife also attended the luncheon.

Xinhua News Agency, Nangal, January 1st: Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long, accompanied by Indian Prime Minister Nehru, visited India's most important hydroelectric power and irrigation project, the Bhakra-Nangal Dam Project, on December 31st. A special car transported them from Delhi across the green plains and the five rivers of the Punjab, arriving at the Nangal dam station in the morning. They spent most of the night on the train.

The station of this small town, surrounded by the 3,000-foot high mountains along the outer edge of the Himalayas, was decked out in festive attire. The Chinese guests and Prime Minister Nehru were welcomed by Punjab Governor Singh and Chief Minister Kairon. Singh and Kairon then introduced the ministers and officials of the Punjab government, as well as the General Manager of the dam project, Kongar, to the guests.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long reviewed the guard of honor to the sounds of the national anthems of China and India, and then entered the small town of 15,000 people. As they entered the town, groups of white doves were released.

The two Prime Ministers stood in an open car, clasping their hands in thanks to the more than 50,000 people, workers on the dam project, and children who had traveled long distances from nearby villages to welcome them. People lined the two-and-a-half-mile-long streets of the town as the Prime Ministers drove through. Arches decorated with flags were erected along the streets. Groups of young Punjabi Sikhs shouted "Long live India-China friendship" to the passing cars.

The car continued to drive six miles along a wide asphalt road over hills and valleys. This road was carved along the edge of the lush green mountains, leading to the valley where the 760-foot-high Bhakra dam project was underway. Kanwar Sain, Chairman of the Central Water and Power Commission of the Indian government, Chopra, Joint Director of Engineering and Indian General Manager, and others successively introduced the various construction projects underway.

Construction of the world's highest Bhakra dam began in 1948. It will utilize the Sutlej River, which originates from Lake Manasarovar in Tibet and has enormous waterpower. For a long time, a large amount of river water has been wasted. After the project is completed in 1960, it will be able to irrigate 10 million acres of land and transmit nearly one million kilowatts of electricity from two power stations. These two power stations will be the largest hydroelectric power plants in Asia.

The Chinese guests visited the concrete mixing plant, where buckets of cement were continuously transported by rail, and then transferred by huge overhead cranes. More than 8,000 workers on the construction site worked in three shifts day and night to carry out this 140 million cubic meter concrete project. Nehru said to Zhou Enlai: "On November 17th last year (1955), I filled the first bucket of cement." A dense array of steel frames and steel ribs stood on the dam's foundation. A total of 100,000 tons of cement will be needed to complete the project.

The Chinese and Indian leaders walked to the highest point, where the dam is 1,700 feet long. They also looked at the length of the dam's bottom, which will become the dam's reservoir, with a total capacity of 7.4 million acre-feet, covering an area of 64 square miles. Due to the needs of the dam project, 30,000 villagers from 366 villages must be relocated, and they are all compensated by the government.

On the way back from the Bhakra dam construction site, the Chinese and Indian leaders also visited the Nangal dam, which was completed in 1954. They traveled a short distance along the newly opened canal from this dam. The Governor of Punjab and the Council of Ministers held a grand luncheon at the beautiful Sutlej Mansion on the left bank of the Sutlej River to entertain Premier Zhou Enlai.

    周总理和尼赫鲁总理举行会谈
    周总理和贺龙副总理参观巴克拉——南加尔水闸工程
    新华社南加尔1日电　中国总理周恩来和印度总理尼赫鲁昨天下午在南加尔水闸区举行了三小时会谈。
    两位总理在苏特里杰河左岸苏特里杰大厦外面的一间镶有玻璃窗的小室里密谈，环境十分宁静，静静的河水在旁边潺潺流过。
    在新年前夕欢乐的气氛中，两位总理都神情愉快。
    新华社新德里1日电　尼赫鲁总理今天在总理府请周恩来总理、贺龙副总理共进午餐。达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼也出席午餐。参加午餐的还有副总统拉达克里希南，印度驻中国大使拉·库·尼赫鲁和他的夫人，英迪拉·甘地夫人，外交部秘书长比莱。中国驻印度大使潘自力和他的夫人也参加了午餐。
    新华社南加尔1日电　周恩来总理和贺龙副总理12月31日在印度总理尼赫鲁陪同下参观了印度最重要的水力发电和灌溉工程巴克拉—南加尔水闸工程。专车载送他们从德里跨过了绿色平原、旁遮普土地上的五条河流，在早晨到达南加尔水闸车站。他们在车上度过了大半夜。
    为喜马拉雅山外沿的三千英尺的高山所环绕的这个小镇市的车站披上了节日的盛装。中国贵宾们和尼赫鲁总理受到旁遮普邦邦长辛格和首席部长凯隆的欢迎。辛格和凯隆然后又把旁遮普邦政府的部长和官员以及水闸工程总经理孔加尔介绍给贵宾们。
    周恩来总理和贺龙副总理在中印两国国歌声中检阅了仪仗队，然后进入有一万五千人口的小镇。在他们进入小镇时，人们放出了成群的白鸽。
    两位总理站在敞篷汽车上合手答谢五万多从远近村庄走了很长的路程到这里来的人们、水闸工程的工人和孩子们的欢迎。人们排列在总理们驱车穿过这个小镇二英里半长的街道两旁。街上搭着用旗帜装饰的拱门。成群的旁遮普的锡克族青年对通过的汽车高呼“印度中国万岁”。
    汽车沿着宽阔的柏油公路越过小山和溪谷又继续行驶了六英里。这条公路是沿着青翠的山脉的边沿开凿的，一直通到七百六十英尺高的巴克拉水闸的工程正在进行着的山谷。印度政府中央水利和电力委员会主席康瓦尔·赛因、工程联合主任和印度总管乔普拉及其他一些人相继介绍了正在进行中的各部分建筑工程。
    世界最高的巴克拉水闸是在1948年动工的，它将利用发源于西藏玛那萨罗沃池的水力极大的苏特里杰河的水流为动力。长久以来，大量的河水一直白白浪费了，在1960年这项工程完工以后，它将能灌溉一千万英亩的土地，并且从两个发电站发送将近一百万瓩的电力。这两个发电站将是亚洲最大的水力发电厂。
    中国客人们参观了混凝土搅拌厂，那里，通过铁轨源源不断地运送着大桶的水泥，然后由巨大的高架起重机移送到下面，工地上八千多名工人分三班日夜不停地工作，来进行这项一亿四千万立方公尺的混凝土工程。尼赫鲁对周恩来说：“在去年（1955年）11月17日，我装满了第一桶水泥。”在水闸的地基上，密密麻麻树立着钢架和钢骨。完成这项工程一共需要十万吨水泥。
    中国和印度的领袖们走上了最高的地方，在那里，水闸的长度是一千七百英尺。他们还看了看水闸的底部长度，将来那里将成为水闸的蓄水池，其全部容量将达七百四十万英亩尺，占地六十四平方英里。三百六十六个村庄的三万名村民由于水闸工程的需要，必须迁移，他们都由政府付给赔偿金。
    中国和印度领袖们在从巴克拉水闸工地回去的路上又参观了南加尔水闸。这个水闸工程在1954年完成。他们从这个水闸乘车沿着新开的运河行驶了一小节路。旁遮普邦邦长和部长会议在苏特里杰河左岸的美丽的苏特里杰大厦举行隆重的午宴招待周恩来总理。
