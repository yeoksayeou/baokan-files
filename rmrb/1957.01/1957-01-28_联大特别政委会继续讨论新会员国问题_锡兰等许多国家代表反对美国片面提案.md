Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 26th: The United Nations General Assembly Special Political Committee continued its discussion on the issue of admitting new member states on the 25th. Representatives from countries like Ceylon and Indonesia spoke out against the proposal put forward by the United States, Britain, France, and thirteen other countries, which called for the separate admission of South Korea and South Vietnam into the United Nations.

    Ceylon's representative, Perera, stated that he could not support this proposal because his delegation was unwilling to do anything that would delay the reunification of these divided countries or increase tensions. He said, "We will not do anything that perpetuates their division."

    He further said that Ceylon "in principle" supports the Soviet proposal, which calls for the admission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam into the United Nations, while also admitting South Korea and South Vietnam, rather than only advocating for the admission of South Korea and South Vietnam as the thirteen-nation proposal does.

    Laos' representative, Phanya, said that his delegation would abstain from voting on the thirteen-nation proposal "for practical reasons."

    Representatives from Sudan and Morocco also expressed their lack of support for the thirteen-nation proposal.

    Romania, Albania, and Belarus spoke out against the thirteen-nation proposal and in support of the Soviet proposal.

    Uruguay, Iraq, and Peru spoke in support of the thirteen-nation proposal.

    联大特别政委会继续讨论新会员国问题
    锡兰等许多国家代表反对美国片面提案
    据新华社26日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会特别政治委员会25日继续讨论接纳新会员国的问题。锡兰和印度尼西亚等国家的代表发言反对美英法等十三个国家提出的要求单独接纳南朝鲜和南越加入联合国的提案。
    锡兰代表佩雷拉说，他不能支持这个提案，因为他的代表团不愿意做足以拖延这些被分裂的国家重新统一或者足以增加紧张局势的任何事情。他说，“使它们的分裂长期继续下去的事我们不干。”
    他又说，锡兰“在原则上”支持苏联的提案，这个提案要求接纳朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国参加联合国，同时也接纳南朝鲜和南越参加联合国，而不是像十三国提案那样主张只接纳南朝鲜和南越参加。
    老挝代表番雅说，他的代表团“由于实际的原因”，在表决十三国提案时将弃权。
    苏丹和摩洛哥的代表也表示不支持十三国提案。
    发言反对十三国提案而支持苏联提案的有罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚和白俄罗斯。
    发言支持十三国提案的有乌拉圭、伊拉克和秘鲁。
