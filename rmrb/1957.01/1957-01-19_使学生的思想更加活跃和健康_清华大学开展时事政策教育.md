Xinhua News Agency, January 17th: The Tsinghua University Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is systematically carrying out current affairs and policy education among students, making the thinking of all students more active and healthier.

At the beginning of this semester, Tsinghua University, due to its emphasis on independent thinking and freedom to manage time, a portion of students developed tendencies to neglect politics, belittle the collective, disregard discipline, and disrespect teachers. In response to this situation, the Tsinghua University Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately made resolving the unhealthy ideological problems among students its central task. The Party Committee first convened Party and League cadres to study the reasons why students had vague understandings of some issues, recognizing the necessity of strengthening the Marxist-Leninist ideological front. At the same time, it required cadres to pay attention to patient persuasion when conducting ideological work, opposing any simplistic and rigid approaches. Subsequently, the Party Committee gave a report to all students on the interrelationship and principled boundaries of issues such as democracy and centralism, discipline and freedom, politics and professional work, and independent thinking and humble learning. It also organized students to discuss these issues in connection with current events. The Party Secretary and Committee members participated in the discussion meetings of various classes, encouraging students to speak freely and helping them distinguish right from wrong. The students were very interested in these discussion meetings. Party Committee members also held one-on-one talks with some students after the meetings to give them more help.

After these efforts, the students' thinking became more active than before. When the People's Daily article "Another Discussion on the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship" was broadcast on the radio for the first time, students braved the severe cold to stand under the outdoor loudspeakers to listen to the broadcast; after reading the newspaper the next day, many classes spontaneously started discussions together. Now, many students compare politics and professional work to their two shoulders, believing that lacking one would make them crippled.

    使学生的思想更加活跃和健康
    清华大学开展时事政策教育
    据新华社17日讯　中共清华大学委员会有计划地在学生中展开时事政策教育工作，使全校学生的思想更加活跃，更加健康。
    这一学期开始，清华大学因为强调了独立思考和自由支配时间等原因，一部分学生曾经产生忽视政治、轻视集体、不守纪律、不尊重教师的偏向。针对这种情形，中共清华大学委员会立即把解决学生中的不健康的思想问题列为中心工作。党委会首先召集党、团干部，研究学生们对一些问题认识模糊的原因，认识到加强马克思列宁主义思想阵地的必要，同时要求干部在进行思想工作时注意循循善诱，反对任何简单生硬的作法。接着，党委会向全校学生作了有关民主同集中、纪律同自由、政治同业务、独立思考同虚心学习等问题的相互关系和原则界限的报告，并且结合时事问题组织学生讨论。党委书记和委员们分头参加了各班学生的讨论会，鼓励学生们畅所欲言，并且帮助他们明辨是非。学生们对这种讨论会都很感兴趣。党委委员们还在会后同一些学生进行一次再一次的漫谈，给他们更多的帮助。
    经过这些工作以后，学生们的思想比以前更加活跃了。人民日报“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”一文第一次在广播电台广播时，学生们冒着严寒站在露天的喇叭下听广播；第二天读了报纸后，许多班又自动在一起展开了讨论。现在，许多学生把政治和业务比作自己的两个肩膀，认为缺一个都会变成残废。
