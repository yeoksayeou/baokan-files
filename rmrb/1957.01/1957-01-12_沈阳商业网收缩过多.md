    Excessive Contraction of Shenyang's Commercial Network
    By Our Correspondent Jin Yukun

    Living in Shenyang, one often feels many inconveniences. It is difficult to find even a small shop for breakfast of soybean milk and sesame cakes. Sometimes one has to walk a long way to buy a pack of cigarettes. On some streets, one cannot find a single store for several miles. For example, from Zhongshan Square to Xiaoximen, a distance of six miles, there is not a single department store despite tens of thousands of residents. From Nanjing Street to the Maternity and Child Health Hospital, there is only a small department store branch in eight miles. On holidays, residents flock to the large department stores in the city center. Due to the overcrowding, it is difficult for the stores to maintain order and ensure the safety of the elderly, children, and pregnant women. At the Taiyuan Street United Company (the largest department store), some customers enter from the east gate, are caught in the crowd without even touching the counter, and are squeezed out by the crowd from the north gate.

    Crowding – this is one of the signs of rising social purchasing power. With the development of industrial construction in Shenyang, the population has increased by 36% in recent years (the largest population in history was in 1942, with 1.57 million people in the city; in June 1956, the city's population was 2.15 million). Social purchasing power in 1956 was about twice as high as in 1950. However, the crowding in Shenyang's stores today is due not only to purchasing power, but also to the excessive contraction of the commercial network over the years – with a large decrease in both large and small stores and vendors. In the past few years, when the rise in purchasing power was slower, the problem was not so profound and acute. Since the second half of 1956, when social purchasing power changed dramatically, the long-accumulated problems have been exposed.

    First, let's look at the large stores. Shenyang has three commercial districts: Zhongjie, Taiyuan Street, and Beishi District. The oldest is Zhongjie in the city center. There used to be twenty-seven large department and general merchandise stores here. Some famous old shops were concentrated here. Now, only seven department and general merchandise stores remain in Zhongjie, such as the Department Store No. 2, and the other twenty have been converted into offices, wholesale departments, means of production stores, and staff dormitories. There were also three large shopping malls, but only one has recently been restored as a branch of the No. 2 Store, and the rest no longer exist. Taiyuan Street has been reduced from nine large department stores to five, and Beishi District has also been reduced from nine to one, and the three shopping malls are also gone.

    Small and medium-sized stores are most closely related to residents. According to some old Shenyang residents, before 1936, many streets in Shenyang were not as sparse as they are now, but were lined with stores, and were as prosperous as Beijing. Zhongshan Road, a major street in the city, used to have stores one after another, but now there are very few. Apart from the new small stores set up by the local trade company with one face, the older department stores and silk and fabric stores have almost disappeared. The large reduction in small and medium-sized stores and the incompleteness of varieties inevitably increase the pressure on large stores, and people have to go to large stores for everything, no matter how small or expensive. For example, 70% of the sales of department store goods are concentrated in the five large stores of the department store company. Before liberation, Shenyang also had night markets, and the main commercial districts were open until about midnight. Now, most small and medium-sized stores close at 5:30 pm, and large stores close no later than 8:30 pm. Things that could have been bought on weekdays have to be concentrated on holidays. Since 1956, the number of street vendors has also decreased by nearly half, and vendors selling dumplings, wontons, shumai, and oily tea along the street have almost disappeared.

    Shenyang's service facilities are also extremely disproportionate to an industrial city with more than two million people. More than ten large hotels that could accommodate more than 100 people, such as Asia, Central, Yong'an, Kuixing, and Liaodong, have been used as offices and dormitories. Now, hundreds of travelers in Shenyang have no place to stay every day and can only stay in bathhouses. Famous restaurants such as Lumingchun, Houdefu, Dongtingchun, Minghuchun, and Zhicheng have all closed down, leaving only a few such as Shaoyuan and Xiangxue. It is also difficult to find decent dry cleaners and barber shops.

    On some busy streets in Shenyang, one can often see many store fronts that have now been hung with signs of government agencies. Among them, the signs of commercial management agencies are the most numerous. The offices or dormitories of the city's food, department store, and warehousing companies, as well as the provincial transportation and electrical, hardware, and pharmaceutical companies, and the provincial department store wholesale station, are all former large stores, hotels, and restaurants. Some stores that operate wholesale and means of production are also located in the closed large department and general merchandise stores on busy streets. Other agencies, such as the office of the Provincial Agricultural Products Procurement Office, are also located on the site of one of Shenyang's three major department stores; the old Songhua River Shopping Mall has now become the guest house of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The famous Lumingchun Restaurant has now been marked with the sign of the Shenyang County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China. Other units such as the Municipal Real Estate Management Bureau, the People's Court of the Nan'an District, the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the Northeast Industrial Exhibition Hall have also occupied store buildings.

    There is also a noteworthy issue here: stores are decreasing year by year, and commercial management agencies are increasing year by year. In 1955, there were fourteen specialized companies in the city, and in 1956, the number increased to twenty-five. With fewer stores and more customers, many salespersons have to work too hard, resulting in many illnesses. On the one hand, some stores have a shortage of salespersons, while on the other hand, there are more and more management personnel. Among all the personnel of the fifteen companies under the Shenyang Municipal First Commercial Bureau, only about 37% are directly engaged in business, while other administrative management support staff account for about 63%. Among them, the management personnel of hardware, transportation and electrical, and other companies account for about two-thirds. The two second-hand consignment stores in Shenyang used to be managed by a section of four people from the service industry company, but after the establishment of the trust company, they were managed by sixty-two people, still completing the same amount of tasks. Many companies have essentially become administrative bureaus rather than business organizations. Private businesses used to have fewer management personnel, but they have also expanded greatly after joint operation. For example, although the catering industry company has been streamlined, there are still more than 470 management personnel in the Heping District. Some restaurants have increased from one manager and one accountant to three managers and four accountants. As a result, some stores have to lose money every month due to too many management personnel. For example, the gross profit of the three stores under the Sugar and Pastry Company can only maintain about half of the expenses. The Food and Grocery Company has sixteen stores in total, but eleven of them are losing money.

    In the early days of liberation, private businesses were restored to a certain extent. However, during the "Five-Anti" campaign in 1952, due to insufficient understanding of the use of private businesses and the preservation and development of the original commercial network, there was a lack of support for the difficulties faced by private businesses at that time, and some even adopted erroneous exclusionary practices, so that many private stores could not maintain their operations and closed down. Many famous old stores with characteristics were mostly closed at this time. In particular, the reduction of larger hardware, department store, and silk and fabric stores was even greater. During this period, although the state-owned commercial network developed greatly, it was still difficult to make up for this deficiency. During the period of joint state-private ownership of the entire industry, in the economic reorganization, many retail stores and branches were blindly merged and abolished. According to statistics, 8,832 stores in the city participated in joint operation and formed cooperative stores, and now they have been merged into 2,594 points (of course, some of them have been merged reasonably), reducing the number of retail points by more than two-thirds. Many husband-and-wife stores have also been merged in large numbers. The number of food and grocery and general merchandise stores has been reduced from 1,357 points to 505 points. The Heping District Food and Grocery No. 7 Cooperative Store has been reduced from 47 points (including 37 small vendors) to 4 points. In addition, during this period, the excessive division of commercial institutions also contributed to the reduction of some supply points. For example, the original comprehensive small stores distributed in various corners, because the original company was divided in detail, in order to reduce concurrent operations, many department store, Western medicine, and general merchandise counters were removed from the 226 branches. Although warnings were repeatedly issued during the economic reorganization, the phenomenon of blindly merging and abolishing stores was not actually stopped. Therefore, many problems were left behind. In the past, there were 536 tofu stores in the city, making and selling in the front and back, which was very convenient. In the reorganization, in order to concentrate production, they were merged into 171 production points, attempting to develop into large-scale tofu processing plants. After the concentration, they only focused on processing and stopped retail, and implemented an eight-hour work system. As a result, due to the reduction of supply points, even buying tofu required queuing. In the past, there were more than 4,000 clothing stores in the city, distributed in the streets and alleys, specializing in odd jobs and turning old clothes into new ones. After the reorganization, they were merged into 71 cooperatives and 587 branches, only willing to undertake large-scale processing and unwilling to accept odd jobs, which created a serious situation where residents had nowhere to sew cotton clothes in winter. The number of private coal stores has also been reduced from 302 supply points to 89. Due to the large reduction in supply points, coupled with the shortage of transportation capacity, although large coal plants have a lot of coal in stock after winter, they cannot be distributed, creating an artificial shortage of heating coal supply. In the past, coal stores also operated firewood, lime, bricks, and tiles, which was convenient for the masses and could adjust the unevenness of busy and slack seasons. After joint operation, because the coal stores are led by the Coal Construction Company, they only supply coal and do not operate other businesses, so even if you buy coal, you cannot buy firewood. These make the problem of Shenyang's commercial network today even more complex.

    The rational establishment and adjustment of the existing commercial network has become an urgent issue in the lives of Shenyang residents. The city's original commercial network was formed after many years of adjustment, addition, and subtraction. Its establishment has a certain basis and is more convenient for residents. Therefore, making rash and arbitrary changes without sufficient investigation and research will inevitably cause serious adverse consequences. The purpose of the establishment of commercial institutions and economic reorganization should be to facilitate residents' consumption. Some commercial management agencies, under the pretext of facilitating management, require further concentration and reduction of supply points; some, under the pretext of subdividing businesses, reduce concurrent operations or the number of supply points. This situation should be completely stopped. The overlapping, bloated, and seriously hindering the work enthusiasm of grassroots units commercial management agencies need to be drastically streamlined, and a large number of personnel should be liberated and used to increase the number of supply points. Solving the shortage of large stores is currently difficult with large-scale national investment, but it is possible to make use of the adjustment of existing store premises. With the streamlining of management and administrative agencies, and from the perspective of facilitating consumption for more than two million people, as long as the leadership is determined, the rational adjustment of the large number of commercial network premises that have been occupied can be done. Wholesale institutions and means of production stores located on busy streets can also be relocated. At the same time, appropriately setting up specialized stores in commercial areas can also reduce the crowding of large department stores. As for setting up and restoring small and medium-sized stores, it is much easier than large stores, among which those that were blindly merged in the reorganization need to be restored first. Handicraft production units that supply people's daily necessities can also consider restoring the attached branches. In the past, many government agencies and enterprises had their own small cooperatives, which may not be a bad way to increase supply points. In short, there are many ways to think about it. The leading authorities in Shenyang have now begun to pay attention to studying this issue.

    沈阳商业网收缩过多
    本报记者　金雨困
    在沈阳居住，经常使人感到很多的不方便。早晨想吃点豆浆、烧饼，也找不到小铺。有时要买包香烟，也得跑很远的路。有些街道，好几里地也看不到一家商店。如从中山广场到小西门长达六里路，居住着数十万居民，却没有一家百货商店。从南京街到妇婴医院，八里路中仅设一个小型百货门市部。到了假日，居民就拥向市中心的大型百货商店。由于过于拥挤，以致商店维持秩序和保证老幼、妇婴的安全也有困难。太原街联营公司（最大的百货商店）有的顾客从东门进去，夹在人群里连柜台边也没摸着，又被人群从北门挤出来。
    拥挤——这是社会购买力上升的征象之一。沈阳市随着工业建设的发展，几年来人口已增加了36％（历史上人口最多的是1942年，全市有一百五十七万人口，1956年6月全市人口为二百一十五万）。社会购买力1956年较1950年提高了两倍左右。但是沈阳市目前商店的拥挤除了购买力问题外，还有其它的因素，这就是历年来商业网收缩过多——无论大小商店和商贩都大量减少。前几年，由于购买力上升较慢，问题还不是如此深刻和尖锐。自1956年下半年社会购买力情况起了极大变化，长期积累的问题都集中地暴露出来了。
    先看大型商店。沈阳的商业区有三个：中街、太原街、北市区。最老的是城里的中街。这里原有大型百货杂货商店二十七家。一些著名的老店都集中于此。现在中街经营百货杂货商店仅剩百货公司第二商店等七家，其余二十家都已作了办公室、批发部、生产资料商店和职工宿舍了。还有三个大型商场，除了一个商场最近恢复为二商店的门市部外，其余也都不存在。太原街由原有九家大型百货商店减少到五家，北市区也由九家减少到一家，三个商场也没有了。
    同居民关系最密切的还是中小型商店。据一些老沈阳人谈，在1936年以前，沈阳的许多街道并不像现在这样稀稀落落的，也是商店毗邻，繁华近似北京。市内的一条大街——中山路过去商店一家挨着一家，现在却是寥寥可数。除了一副面孔的地方贸易公司新设的小商店外，老一点的百货店和绸布店已几乎绝迹。中小型商店大量减少和品种不全，势必增加大商店的压力，买东西不论大小贵贱都非去大商店不可。如百货商品70％的卖钱额集中在百货公司的五个大商店。解放前沈阳也有夜市，主要商业区也要营业到深夜十二时左右。现在，大部中小商店五点半就关了门，大商店至迟八点半也不营业了。本来平时可买的东西也非集中到假日不可。1956年以来，串街的商贩也减少近一半，沿街卖饺子、馄饨、烧麦、油茶的商贩也几乎绝迹。
    沈阳的服务性设施也与二百多万人口的工业城市极不相称。原有能容纳百人以上的大旅社如亚洲、中央、永安、魁星、辽东等十多个都已被作为办公室和宿舍。现在沈阳每天有数百旅客没有地方住，只能借宿浴室。过去著名的饭馆如鹿鸣春、厚德福、洞庭春、明湖春、志诚等现均已停业，仅剩勺园、香雪等寥寥数家。比较像样的洗染店和理发店也很难找到。
    在沈阳的一些繁华街道，经常可以看到许多沿街的商店门市房屋，现在都已挂上了机关的招牌。其中尤以商业管理机构的招牌为最多。市食品、百货、仓储及省交电、五金、医药等公司和省百货批发站等机构的办公室或宿舍，都是过去的一些大型商店、旅社和饭馆。一些经营批发和生产资料的商店，也都设在繁华街道上已停业的大型百货杂货商店里。其它机关如省农产品采购厅的办公室，也设在过去沈阳三大百货商店之一的旧址；旧松花江商场现已成为市公安局的招待所。有名的鹿鸣春饭馆现已挂上中共沈阳县委的牌子。其它如市房地产管理局、南市区人民法院、市工商联及东北工业陈列馆等单位也都占用了商店房屋。
    这里还有一个值得注意的问题：商店逐年减少，商业管理机构逐年增加。1955年全市有专业公司十四个，1956年增至二十五个。商店少，顾客拥挤，许多营业员不得不过度紧张操劳，以致病者很多。一方面有些商店营业员不足，而另一方面管理人员却越来越多。沈阳市第一商业局所属十五个公司全部人员中，直接从事业务的营业人员仅占37％左右，其它行政管理勤杂人员却达63％左右。其中五金、交电等公司管理机构人员都要占三分之二左右。沈阳的两个旧物委托商店，过去受服务业公司一个科四个人管理，信托公司成立后就变为六十二个人管理，仍然完成那么多的任务。许多公司实质已成管理局而不是业务机构。私营商业过去管理人员是较少的，但合营后也大为膨胀。如饮食业公司虽经精简，但目前和平区的管理人员仍达四百七十多人。有的饭店由原一个经理一个会计增加到三个经理四个会计。因此有些商店由于管理人员太多而不得不月月赔钱。如糖业糕点公司所属三个商店，所得毛利仅能维持开支的一半左右。食品杂货公司共有十六个商店，却有十一个是赔钱的。
    解放初期，私营商业曾得到一定恢复。但到1952年“五反”期间，由于对利用私营商业及保存和发挥原有商业网的作用认识不足，因此对当时私营商业存在的困难缺乏应有的扶持，有些还采取了错误的排挤作法，以致许多私营商店无法维持而停业不少。许多著名的具有特点的老店大部是在这时停闭的。特别是较大的五金、百货、绸布商店减得更多。这个时期，国营商业网虽有极大发展，但仍很难补此不足。在全行业公私合营时期，在经济改组中，又盲目地大量合并，撤销了许多零售店和门市部。据统计，全市参加合营和组成合作商店的有八千八百三十二家，现已并成二千五百九十四个点（当然，其中也有并得合理的），减少了零售点三分之二以上。众多的夫妻老婆店也大量合并了。食品杂货和百杂货小铺由一千三百五十七个点减少到五百零五个点。和平区食品杂货第七合作商店由四十七个点（其中有三十七个小摊贩）减少到四个点。此外，在这个时期，由于商业机构划得过细，也促成部分供应点的减少。如原分布在各个角落的综合性小商店，因原属公司划细后，为了减少兼营业务，在二百二十六处门市部中撤去了不少百货、西药、杂货等商品柜台。在经济改组中虽一再发出警号，但是盲目合并撤销商店的现象实际并未得到制止。因此留下的问题很多。过去全市有五百三十六家豆腐店，后边做前边卖，很方便。改组中，为了集中生产，合并为一百七十一个生产点，企图向大型豆腐加工厂发展。集中后只管加工停止了零售，并实行了八小时工作制。结果由于供应点减少，连买豆腐也非排队不可。过去全市有四千多个成衣铺分布在大街小巷，专做零活和翻旧整新，改组后合并为七十一个合作社，五百八十七个门市部，只愿承揽大批加工不愿接零活，这就造成了冬季居民棉衣无处缝的严重局面。私营煤炭店亦由过去三百零二个供应点减少到八十九个，由于供应点的大量减少，加上运输力的不足，入冬后虽大煤厂存煤很多，却无法分配下去，造成了取暖煤供应的人为紧张。过去煤炭店还兼营劈柴、石灰、砖瓦等，既便利于群众又可调剂淡旺季忙闲的不均。合营后因煤炭店属煤建公司领导，只供应煤不兼营其它，这样就是买到了煤也买不到劈柴。这些，就使今天沈阳商业网的问题更加复杂。
    合理的设置和调整现有的商业网，已成为沈阳市居民生活中的一个迫切问题。城市原有的商业网，是经过多少年来的调整增减才形成的，它的设置都有一定的根据，也较便利于居民的。因此，没有经过充分调查研究，就轻率任意变动，必然会造成严重的恶果。商业机构的设置和经济改组，目的都应该是为了便于居民的消费。有的商业管理机构借口便于管理，要求进一步集中，减少供应点；有的借口业务划细减少兼营或供应点的情况，应该彻底制止。目前重叠臃肿并且严重妨害了基层单位工作积极性的商业管理机构，需要大刀阔斧的精简，把大量的人员解放出来用在增设的供应点上。解决大型商店的不足，目前要靠国家大量投资是有困难的，但是可以利用调剂原有商店用房，这随着管理行政机构的精简，并从为二百多万人民消费便利的观点出发，只要领导下定决心，已被占用的大量商业网用房的合理调整是可以办到的事情。设在繁华街道上的批发机构和生产资料商店也可迁移。同时，在商业区适当设置专业商店也可减少大型百货商店的拥挤现象。至于设置和恢复中小型商店，就要比大型商店容易得多，其中在改组中盲目合并的需要首先恢复。供应人民生活用品的手工业生产单位，也可考虑恢复过去附设的门市部。过去许多机关企业曾自设小型合作社，也未必不是增加供应点的办法之一。总之，可以想的办法是不少的。现在沈阳市的领导机关已开始注意研究这个问题。
