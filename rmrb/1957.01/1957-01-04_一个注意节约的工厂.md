    Walking into the gate of the Qijiang Automobile Parts Factory, one can see rows of long blackboards on both sides of the road, with many articles praising thrifty individuals and criticizing waste. An article titled "Using Plastic Instead of Copper" praised engineer Lai Yuanda's new achievement in using plastic instead of copper to make steel plate copper sleeves, considering it a new direction for saving metal. In an article titled "This Waste Product Died So Miserably," a worker was criticized for dishonorably mixing his waste products with qualified products. Such praise and criticism from the masses has become a common practice in this factory.
    The factory's buildings and machinery are quite old. The factory director's office and administrative offices are converted from an old workshop building. On rainy days, some rooms need lights to work. The factory's production has increased year by year; in 1956 alone, it increased by 47% compared to 1955. However, they have not added any production buildings or purchased much new machinery. These days, some workshops are beginning to adjust their factory buildings and machinery. The engineer in charge of this work told reporters that this is another measure they have taken to save on the cost of building factory buildings and adding equipment in order to meet the even greater production tasks of 1957. After the existing factory buildings and equipment are adjusted, the utilization rate of the factory buildings can be increased threefold, and the products that each machine tool can produce annually can be increased from 3.84 tons to 7 tons.
    Almost in every corner of the factory, one can see moving examples of workers practicing diligence and thrift. In the casting section of the repair workshop, the workers who pour copper sleeves sweep up all the copper particles that drip into the ash around the furnace during casting. Casting worker Zhang Balun told reporters that although it seems like a small matter to drop a drop or two of copper water when pouring a copper sleeve, it is not simple when you calculate it. In 1956, we "panned for gold" in this way and extracted more than 6,000 kilograms of pure copper worth over 10,000 yuan. In a simple shed, a furnace is constantly smelting metal shavings left over from machining products in the metalworking workshop. In the past, these shavings were casually piled in the open air, left to rust. Since the factory launched a thrift campaign, the workers have collected them and refined them into iron balls, which are supplied to steel mills for production. More than 300 tons of iron balls were refined in 1956.
    Walking into the steel plate workshop of this factory, one striking thing is that after the workers who cut steel plates cut huge steel plates of different specifications into materials needed for production, only a very small piece of leftover material remains. It is said that in the past, workers often caused a lot of leftover material due to improper cutting, which was a great pity. Since they implemented a "matching blanking" method, the leftover material quickly dropped from 6% to 10% of the total blanking amount to 2% to 4%, so that this department produced more than 60,000 pieces of spring steel for the country in one year using the same materials. In 1956, the workers of this factory saved more than 480 tons of alloy steel for the country in this way.
    In this factory, it can also be seen that the staff and workers regard improving product quality as an important part of comprehensive conservation, and a trend of everyone caring about quality is taking shape. Now, each workshop has a waste product table and a waste product exhibition table. Every day before or after work, many workers gather here to see if there are any waste products from themselves or their group. Many workshops, sections, and groups have conspicuous quality progress charts, which fill in the monthly waste product control number of the unit and the daily scrap report of the product. It has become an instruction chart that encourages and urges workers to continuously improve quality. Due to attention to quality, the metalworking workshop staff quickly reduced the waste rate of the entire workshop from 1.7% in July to 0.5% in November.

### 一个注意节约的工厂

    一个注意节约的工厂
    新华社记者　胡明俊
    走进綦江汽车配件厂的大门，就可以看到马路的两旁排着两行长长的黑板报，上边登着许多表扬节约人物和批评浪费的稿件。一篇“用塑料代替铜料”的稿子，赞扬了工程师来元达用塑料代铜料制成钢板铜套的新成就，认为这是节约金属的新方向。在一篇“这废品死得好苦呀”的稿中，批评了一个工人把自己的废品混在合格品内的不荣誉事件。这种来自群众的表扬和批评，在这个工厂里已经成为一种风气。
    这个厂的厂房和机器设备是很陈旧的。厂长室和行政科室的办公室，是由一栋古老的车间房舍改成的，在阴雨天有些屋里要开灯才能办公。这个厂的生产年年提高，仅1956年就比1955年提高了47％，可是他们却没有添建过生产厂房，也很少添置机器。这几天有些车间在开始调整厂房和机器设备。负责指挥这项工作的工程师告诉记者说，这是他们为了迎接1957年更大的生产任务，再次采取的节省建设厂房和添设备费用的措施。现有厂房和设备经过调整以后，厂房的利用率可以提高三倍，每台机床每年能够生产出的产品可以由三点八四吨提高到七吨。
    几乎在这个厂的每个角落，都可以看到工人们勤俭节约的动人事例。在修配车间铸工段，浇铜套的工人把浇铸时滴在炉旁灰渣里的铜粒全扫起来。浇铸工张捌伦对记者说，别看浇一个铜套滴落一两点铜水事小，算起账来可不简单，1956年我们就这样“沙里淘金”，便淘出六千多斤价值上万元的纯铜来。在一个简陋的篷房里，一座熔炉成天都在冶炼金工车间车制产品留下的金属切屑。这些切屑过去都随便抛堆在露天里，任其锈烂。自从全厂开展节约活动以后，工人们又把它们收集起来，炼成铁球，供应钢铁厂生产了。在1956年内炼出的铁球，就有三百多吨。
    走进这个厂的钢板工部，一件引人注目的事是：剪切钢板的工人把不同规格的巨型钢板剪成生产需要的成材以后，只剩下很小一片余料。据说，过去工人们常常因为剪切不当，造成余料很多，非常痛惜。自从他们推行了一种“搭配下料”的方法，余料很快就由原来占下料总量的6％到10％降到2％到4％，这样就使这个工部在一年内用同样的材料给国家多生产了六万多片弹簧钢板。1956年，这个厂的工人们就是这样为国家节约了四百八十多吨合金钢材。
    在这个厂里还可以看到，职工们把提高产品质量看作全面节约的重要内容，人人关心质量的风气正在形成。现在，每个车间都设有废品台和废品展览台，每天上班前或下班后，都有许多工人聚在这里，关心地瞧瞧有没有自己和本组的废品。许多车间、工段和小组，都贴有醒目的质量进度表，上边填写着本单位全月的废品控制数和产品逐日报废情况。它已经成为鼓舞和督促工人们不断改进质量的指示图表。金工车间职工由于注意质量，全车间的废品率很快就由7月份的1.7％降到11月份的0.5％。
