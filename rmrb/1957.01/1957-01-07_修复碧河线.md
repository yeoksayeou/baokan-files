    Repairing the Bisezhai-Hekou Railway Line
    By our correspondent Chen Yongjin

    The 300-plus-mile line from Bisezhai in Yunnan Province to Hekou is, from morning to night, immersed in an atmosphere of intense and enthusiastic labor. Trucks busily transport everything needed to repair the railway along the bumpy Bisezhai-Hekou line. Workers from the railway engineering teams are busy building bridges and culverts; laborers from near and far are turning over the stone ballast of the original damaged railway subgrade from the soil, sifting it with sieves, and placing it neatly on both sides of the road. Whenever the order is given to lay the tracks, they will pave the stone ballast. The sound of blasting rocks, the clanging of iron, and the humming of trucks echo in the deep green valleys. Horses transporting vegetables also sway their copper bells as they walk on this only road. Trucks and trucks, trucks and horse carts, must carefully give way to each other when they meet. This railway is located in rare, continuous mountains, in rare, perilous canyons, and in rare subtropical forests. Villages are scarcer than morning stars along this 300-plus-mile line.
    We took a small train fifty miles south from Bisezhai and stayed in a small town. The commanders of the railway engineering for the Bisezhai-Hekou line repair reside here. Jian Jincai, a young man from the Northeast, said to me as soon as he saw me, "Tomorrow, you will see the boundless bamboo forests. Here you will feel the richness and beauty of our motherland. The mountains here are mostly black soil mountains, where anything grows. This area will be the best rubber plantation in our country in the future." Speaking of this, Jian Jincai's eyes were filled with hatred, "How could imperialism not be greedy for such a good place?" Jian Jincai looked at me and said, "This railway was built by French imperialism in eight years. Imperialism has stolen a lot of things from us through this railway. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang blew up many bridges on this section of the line. In 1951, we converted the original railway line into a highway. The repair of this railway will open up a gateway for foreign trade in southwest China, further strengthen Yunnan's industrial construction, further support the fraternal ethnic minorities in these deep mountains, and create conditions for the future construction of the Yunnan-Guizhou Railway."
    The repair of this railway will bring some unimaginable benefits to the people of Yunnan. Precisely because of this, our railway workers and the people of some fraternal ethnic minorities in our border areas are working here with unlimited power to overcome difficulties. On this short 300-plus-mile railway line, not to mention the steep slopes and small curves, there are more than ninety mountain tunnels alone. Although many places here are forest areas, the ethnic minorities have paid a great price for each of the required sleepers. The 280,000 sleepers needed here were cut down from the high mountains one by one by more than twenty ethnic minorities, and then transported either from the rapids, or carried out by livestock, or even carried out on shoulders. Strangely, there are so many ants here that ordinary sleepers placed there will be destroyed by ants in two years. Therefore, they especially use a rare chestnut wood, which will be immune to ant damage. On this Bisezhai-Hekou line, there are still iron telegraph poles used by French imperialism for fear of ants. Many railway workers say that in this area, it is more cost-effective to use iron skin for sleepers. However, at a time when our country is engaged in large-scale construction and has a large demand for steel, the workers here can only use stinky oil to prevent ants and corrosion. It is said that this is not as durable as ordinary sleepers in the north.
    In a canyon in Baizhai, the tall bridge piers have been built to more than twenty meters high. The workers building this bridge pier said that this bridge pier will be built to forty meters high. I once heard that the bridge piers of the Yangtze River Bridge were less than forty meters high. Of course, there are no rapids in the Yangtze River here, because transportation is difficult and the conditions for building materials are also very difficult. However, in order to save money for the country, our workers overcame the difficulty of lacking scaffolding and used well frames to replace scaffolding, saving a large amount of funds. In the construction, rubble masonry was used instead of reinforced concrete, and the Baizhai bridge pier alone can save thousands of tons of cement.
    The responsible comrades of the railway engineering team insisted that we see their iron furnace. He said that Zhang Yongchun and He Yingzhan's iron furnace has manufactured more than 5,000 tools since the start of construction. A stocky, not-tall young man held the tongs and used a piece of molten iron to make a digging knife. He concentrated his attention, took it out and hammered it a few times with a clanging sound, and then puffed and puffed to pull up the bellows. This young man is called He Yingzhan, he is from Sichuan, and he only came to the railway engineering team in February 1956. At home, he was a farmer. When he came to the railway, the leaders asked him to learn the technique of blacksmithing. At that time, Xiao He thought that he was a member of the Communist Youth League, and he would do whatever the leaders on the railway asked him to do. In this way, his blacksmithing life began. In winter on the Bisezhai-Hekou line, people still have to work in single clothes or even bare backs; the degree of heat in summer here is unimaginable. In those hot days, railway workers and farmers continued to send in a large number of damaged tools, and were urgently waiting for the blacksmith to repair them. Xiao He was afraid that the furnace fire would not burn well, so he desperately pulled the bellows, and he was determined to master the technique of blacksmithing. Whenever Master Zhang Yongchun rested at noon, he would take the tongs and clang the steel buried in the fire. Later, Zhang Yongchun let go and asked him to strike. In those early days of blacksmithing, his hands were swollen from the vibration. Roasted by the fire and baked by the sun, his clothes were really wet with sweat all day long. Even so, he kept hammering. He wholeheartedly wanted to forge more tools to supply the workers on the railway. When he first started making digging knives, he failed once or twice. He asked the master to make them, and he watched carefully; after they were made, he used them himself. If they were not easy to use, he modified them. When he made them for the third time, he succeeded. From late September to October, he made nearly a thousand tools. Xiao He said to me that whenever he thought of the difficulties in repairing our railway, he had inexhaustible energy. In just two months, he became a skilled blacksmith.
    In a small village in the canyon of Baihe Bridge, our car stopped again. Many road construction workers live in this village. Here, the person in charge of the labor team immediately introduced me to Wang Zhenxing and asked him to tell me about the farmers' support for the road construction. He said, look, there is not even a thirty-year-old among these laborers. When they heard that the railway was going to be repaired, they couldn't hold back at home. Among the laborers living in Baishui Bridge alone, there are five or six ethnic groups, but no matter which ethnic group or which person, they all have a common wish: to get their train to come here as soon as possible. Wang Zhenxing is a Nong ethnic from Xichou County. The Nong ethnic group lives in the high mountains. In theory, they cannot withstand the scorching sun on the Bisezhai-Hekou line, but in order to repair the Bisezhai-Hekou line, they have forgotten all these difficulties. I asked Wang Zhenxing to introduce how their laborers work. He said that at the beginning of quarrying, each person only quarried 0.8 cubic meters, but now they have quarried 1.5 cubic meters. After saying these few sentences, Wang Zhenxing talked about their cooperative. He said that in the spring of 1956, a hydropower engineer came to their cooperative. The Jijie Township Agricultural Cooperative is close to the Jinsha River, and a small hydropower station can be built there soon. Once the train is open, maybe the machinery will be transported here. I couldn't understand some of the Nong ethnic people's speech, but he seemed to want me to hear about the affairs of his cooperative. He said that a few days ago, my wife wrote to me saying that our cooperative increased production by 60% in 1956. This is all thanks to the Party Committee for telling us to build water conservancy projects. When I came to the Bisezhai-Hekou line to build roads, the cooperative had 400 mu of dry land converted into paddy fields. Since the establishment of the ethnic united cooperative, the Han, Miao, and Nong ethnic groups have learned from each other and changed the past habit of not applying fertilizer. Just by relying on these measures of water conservancy, fertilization, and land reclamation, we have increased production so much. In the future, when the train passes through, the enthusiasm of the masses for production will be even greater. With more machinery, the lives of the people in our high mountains will change even faster. Therefore, when the cooperative called for registration to build the railway, I ran to go. My mother said, you go to build the railway, who will engage in production at home? My father said: Call him to go to the railway. He should work on the railway for a few years. Our generations have never seen a train. My wife said: Go ahead, we will definitely do a good job in production at home. She packed my luggage and I came. I am really happy to come to the railway. The cooperative has a bumper harvest, we have exceeded the task, and we have also learned culture. Wang Zhenxing said, taking out a pen from his pocket. Everyone here has bought a pen. When we finish building the railway and return home, we will all become cultured people.

    修复碧河线
    本报记者　陈勇进
    从云南省碧色寨到河口的三百多里的线路上，从早到晚都沉浸在紧张热烈的劳动声里。卡车忙碌地沿着颠簸的碧河线运输修复铁路所需的一切东西。铁路工程队的职工们在忙着修筑桥梁涵洞；来自远近的民工们在把原来被破毁的铁路路基的石渣重新从泥土中翻过来，用筛子筛一遍，有秩序地摆在路两边。什么时候一声铺轨命令，他们就会把石渣铺好。那炸石头的炮响的声音，那打铁的叮咚的声音，卡车的嗡嗡的声音，回荡在深绿的山谷里。那运输蔬菜的马匹，也摇曳着脖子上的铜铃铛在这条唯一的道路上走着。卡车和卡车、卡车和马车碰了头都要小心地让路。这条铁路在少有的丛山峻岭中，在少有的奇险的峡谷里，在少有的亚热带的森林里。这三百多里的线路上，村庄少得比晨星还稀。
    我们从碧色寨往南趁小火车走了五十里，在一个小镇子上住下来。在这里住着修复碧河线的铁路工程的指挥人员。简金财，一个来自东北的青年人，一见我就说：“明天，你就会看见那无边的竹林子，在这里你会感到我们的祖国的富饶和美丽。这里的山多是黑土山，种什么长什么。这一带将来是我国最好的橡胶园。”简金财谈到这里，眼里带着仇恨说：“这样好的地方，帝国主义能不馋吗？”简金财看了看我说：“这条铁路是法帝国主义用了八年的时间修成的。帝国主义从这条铁路上没少抢走我们的东西。抗日战争期间，国民党把这段路上的不少桥梁炸毁了。1951年我们把原来的铁路线改修成公路。这条铁路的修复，将会开辟我国西南对外贸易的大门，会进一步加强云南的工业建设，进一步支援这深山里的兄弟民族，对今后滇黔铁路的修建也创造了条件。”
    这条铁路的修复，将给云南人民带来一些想像不到的好处。正因为这样，我们的铁路职工，我们边疆的一些兄弟民族的人民才以克服困难的无限力量在这里工作。在这短短的三百多里的铁道线上，坡度大、弯道小不说，只山洞就有九十多个。在这里虽然很多地方是森林地带，但所需用的枕木，每一根枕木兄弟民族都不知付出了多少辛苦。这里所需要的二十八万根枕木是这里的二十多种兄弟民族从高山上一根根的砍下来，然后或者从激流里运过来，或者用牲口驮出来，甚至是扛出来。在这里，奇怪的是蚂蚁实在太多，普通枕木放在那里，两年就会被蚂蚁咬毁。因此他们特别用一种少有的栗木，这样会免于蚂蚁的毁坏。在这碧河线上，还留着法帝国主义为怕蚂蚁而用的铁电线杆子。不少铁路职工说，在这个地带，枕木用铁皮才合算。不过在我国大规模建设而大量需要钢铁的时候，这里的职工们只有用臭油来防蚂蚁和防腐。据说这样也没有北方普通枕木耐久。
    在白寨的一个峡谷间，那高大的桥墩已建筑到二十多公尺高了。修建这个桥墩的职工说，这个桥墩要修到四十公尺高。我曾经听到长江大桥的桥墩还不到四十公尺。当然这里没有长江中的激流，因为这里交通困难，建筑材料的条件也是十分困难的。但是我们的职工为了给国家节省资金，克服了缺少脚手架的困难，用井字架来代替了脚手架，节约了大批的资金。在施工中，用砌片代替了钢筋水泥，只这个白寨桥墩就可节约上千吨的水泥。
    铁路工程队的负责同志一定要我们看看他们的铁炉。他说，张永春和何应战的铁炉自施工以来已修造了五千多件工具。一个墩墩实实的不高的小伙子拿着火钳把熔化的一块铁来做挖刀。他聚精会神地一会儿拿出来叮叮当当地打几下，然后又噗?噗??地拉起风箱。这个小青年叫何应战，他是四川人，1956年2月才到铁路工程队的。他在家是个农民，来到铁路上，领导上叫他学习这门打铁的技术。当时小何想着，自己是青年团员，在铁路上领导叫干啥干啥。就这样，他打铁的生活开始了。碧河线上的冬天，人们还要穿着单衣甚至要光着脊背工作的；这里的夏天，酷热的程度是难以想像的。就在那炎热的日子里，铁路职工和农民们不断送来大量的损坏了的工具，并且急等着铁工修好。小何恐怕炉火烧不好，就拼命地拉风箱，他并且下定了决心来掌握打铁的技术。每当师傅张永春在中午休息的时候，他就拿着钳子把埋在火里的钢铁叮当地打。后来张永春放开手叫他打，在那打铁最初的日子里，他的手就被震肿了。火烤太阳晒，真是衣服被汗湿得一天没得干。就是那样，他也不停地打。他一心一意地要打更多的工具来供应铁路上的工人们。开始打挖刀时，一次两次都没打成，他叫师傅打，他仔细地看；打好后，他还亲自用一用，不好用了他又改，等他第三次打的时候就打成了。从9月下旬到10月间他就打了近千件工具。小何给我说，每想到我们修复铁路的困难的时候，自己就有用不败的劲。仅两个月，他就成为有技术的铁工了。
    在白河桥那峡谷间的一个小村子上，我们的车又停下来。这个村子上住着很多修路的民工。在这里民工大队的负责人当即给我介绍了王振兴，叫他告诉我农民怎样支援修路的事迹。他说你看看吧，这些民工里面连个三十岁的都没有，他们一听说要修铁路，都在家憋不住了。光住在白水桥的民工中就有五六个民族，可是不管哪个民族的哪个人，都有个共同的愿望：及早地叫自己的火车通到这里来。王振兴是西畴县的侬族人，他们侬族住在大山上，按理说他们是受不了碧河线炎热太阳的暴晒的，但是为了把碧河线修复，这一切艰难都忘在脑后了。我要王振兴介绍他们民工怎样工作的。他说开始打石头时每人只打到零点八公方，现在已打到一点五公方了。王振兴说了这样几句，就谈到他们的合作社上去。他说他们的合作社里，1956年春天来了一个搞水力发电的工程师，我们鸡街乡农业社紧靠金沙江，那里很快就可以修小型水力发电站。火车一通，兴许就把机器运来了。侬族人说话，我还有些不能听懂，但他好像一定要我听他合作社里的事儿。他说，前几天我爱人来信说，我们的合作社里1956年增产六成，这都是党委叫我们兴修水利的好处。我未来碧河线修路时，社里有四百亩旱田改成了水田，从一成立民族联合社起，汉族、苗族、侬族就互相学习，改变了过去不施肥的习惯。就凭了搞水利、施肥、开荒这几个措施，我们就增产了这么多。将来火车通过来，群众生产的积极性更大，再有机器，我们高山上人民的生活变得更快。所以社里一叫报名来修铁路，我就跑着去了。我母亲说，你去修铁路，家里谁搞生产？我父亲说：叫他到铁路上去吧。应当在铁路上做几年工，咱们这世世代代就没见过火车的人。我爱人说：你去吧，我们在家一定搞好生产。她给我捆了捆行李我就来了。来到铁路上真高兴，社里大丰收，我们又超过任务了，并且还学了文化。王振兴说着从口袋里拿出钢笔来，我们这里面的人都买了钢笔，修好铁路回家，都成有文化的人了。
