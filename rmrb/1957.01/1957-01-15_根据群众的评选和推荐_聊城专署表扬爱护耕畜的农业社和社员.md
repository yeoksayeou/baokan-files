Based on mass appraisals and recommendations, the Liaocheng Special District Administrative Office in Shandong Province recently commended 107 agricultural cooperatives that cherish draught animals and a number of outstanding feeders, epidemic prevention workers, veterinarians, and inseminators.

    Chiping County's Chunxiao Agricultural Cooperative is one of the cooperatives commended this time. After becoming an advanced cooperative last spring, it formulated a set of draught animal management systems that integrated feeding, usage, veterinary care, and other aspects, based on the opinions of the members. It also regularly educated members about loving the collective and cherishing the animals. As a result, all of the cooperative's more than 470 draught animals are strong and fat.

    The Bachalu Township Agricultural Cooperative in Guantao County is a large cooperative. Soon after its establishment as an advanced cooperative last spring, chaotic management and use occurred due to centralized feeding of draught animals, leading to serious phenomena of draught animals becoming thin and dying. Later, based on the requirements and actual needs of each production team, the cooperative distributed all 760 draught animals to the production teams for feeding. As a result, not only was the management and care of draught animals by each production team strengthened, but also the difficulties of having few houses, poor equipment, and insufficient fodder were overcome. This cooperative was also commended.

    When commending this group of agricultural cooperatives and members, the Liaocheng Special District also compiled and printed the specific experiences of each cooperative into a booklet and distributed it to agricultural cooperatives throughout the entire special district, calling on them to learn from these advanced experiences and strive to ensure that all draught animals safely survive the winter.

    根据群众的评选和推荐
    聊城专署表扬爱护耕畜的农业社和社员
    山东省聊城专署最近根据群众的评选和推荐，表扬了一百零七个爱护耕畜的农业社和一批出色的饲养员、防疫员、兽医员和配种员。
    茌平县春晓农业社就是这次被表扬的一个社，这个社在去年春天转为高级社以后，就根据社员的意见，制定了一套包括饲养、使役、兽医等多方面相结合的耕畜管理制度，并且经常对社员进行爱社、爱畜的教育。因而全社四百七十多头耕畜个个体壮膘肥。
    馆陶县八岔路乡农业社是个大社。去春成立高级社不久，由于耕畜集中喂养，曾一度出现管理使用混乱，使耕畜瘦弱死亡的严重现象。后来，这个社根据各生产队的要求和实际需要，把七百六十多头耕畜全部分配给生产队喂养。结果，不仅加强了各生产队对耕畜的管理和爱护，还克服了房屋少、设备差和草料不足的困难。这个社也受到了表扬。
    聊城专署在表扬这批农业社和社员的时候，还把各社的具体经验编印成册，分发给全专区的农业社，号召它们学习这些先进经验，争取做到所有耕畜安全过冬。（新华社）
