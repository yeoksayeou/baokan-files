Comrade Dear Academician Petrovsky, Principal of Moscow University, Dear Professors, Dear Student Comrades:

Today, our delegation of the government of the People's Republic of China has the opportunity to visit the highest institution of learning in the Soviet Union, the world-renowned Moscow State University, and to meet with you all here, which makes us feel extremely excited and happy.

Thank you for your warm welcome to us. We regard this welcome as a manifestation of the deepest friendship of the Soviet intellectual circles towards the Chinese intellectual circles. Please allow me, in the name of the Chinese intellectual circles—Chinese scientific and educational workers, Chinese university students, and youth—to pay tribute to you, and through you, to the entire Soviet intellectual circles, Soviet university students, and youth!

You have conferred an honorary degree on me, which is not only my personal honor, but also the honor of the Chinese people. My own knowledge and ability are very inadequate, and I am not worthy of receiving this honorary degree. But I regard this kindness as an encouragement and urging to me. I will work harder to study and work for world peace and for our common communist cause.

We admire your school very much. This school, founded by the "Father of Russian Science" Lomonosov and named after him, has long been the center of advanced science and culture in your country. In the past years, many Russian advanced thinkers and social activists, outstanding writers and scientists have studied and worked here, such as Lermontov, Ostrovsky, Herzen, Belinsky, Turgenev, Chekhov, Zhukovsky, Timiryazev, etc. They have made valuable contributions to promoting the progress of human culture and enriching the treasure house of human knowledge. In the Soviet era, your school has been greatly developed under the care of the Soviet Communist Party and the government, becoming the largest higher education and scientific research institution in the Soviet Union. Here, a large number of experts and scientific workers are trained every year. They are constantly added to the ranks of Soviet intellectuals, and they are engaged in creative and glorious labor to enrich and create socialist culture and make it serve communism.

We are also very grateful to your school. Here, there are hundreds of Chinese youths studying together with Soviet youths. These Chinese youths are sent to your country by our country to train them into talents with advanced scientific and technological knowledge. Just like the Chinese youths studying in other Soviet universities, under the training of Soviet teachers and the help of Soviet classmates, they are working hard to learn the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union, and have established a close friendship with Soviet teachers and youths. The Chinese people regard this help from you as an integral part of the Soviet people's great assistance to China's socialist construction. In order to make them live up to the expectations of our people and not disappoint your help to them, I hope you will urge them more to study hard.

As you already know, the Chinese people regard their revolution and construction as a continuation of the great October Revolution. In the cause of revolution and construction, the Soviet Union is a model for China. In terms of culture, the basic experience of the Soviet Union's cultural revolution and construction has always been extremely beneficial to the Chinese people. Our Chinese culture is still very backward. In order to build socialism and realize socialist industrialization, we especially need a large number of intellectuals with expertise to help develop and create socialist culture, but the old China left us very few such talents. Since the liberation of the whole country, we have made great efforts to develop education, especially higher education. In the past few years, we have trained more than 300,000 college students. The number of students in our country's universities has increased from 116,000 in 1949 to more than 380,000 in 1956. However, whether in terms of quantity or quality, we still feel that the construction of talents is far from meeting the needs of the country. From the experience of the increasingly prosperous and flourishing science and culture of the Soviet Union, we have seen the path for the development of our own socialist culture in China. We will develop and create our country's socialist culture in the struggle to uphold and consolidate the socialist system.

Comrades, although many advanced thinkers and scholars once appeared in your school before the October Revolution, it was precisely because they consciously or unconsciously adhered to the materialist viewpoint, placing the future of mankind on the masses of the people rather than on the decadent, anti-people classes of the time, that their experiences and conditions for engaging in academic research were often unfortunate and difficult. Only after the October Socialist Revolution did this situation undergo a fundamental change. The establishment of a socialist country opened a new page in the history of human culture, and opened up infinitely broad roads for the development of Soviet culture and science. Only at this time could Marxism-Leninism become the guiding ideology of various sciences, enabling them to develop rapidly. This is the main reason why, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party for 40 years, Soviet culture and science have reached the world's most advanced level from the backward state of the Tsarist era. This fact cannot be denied by anyone.

Of course, we should not be complacent in the field of culture and science. Lenin repeatedly told us to be good at absorbing all the good things in human culture, but we must also be good at distinguishing which are truly beneficial and which are poisonous. In order to promote the development of literature and art, we in China have put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." Of course, we do this in order to develop and enrich socialist culture, and not to abolish or weaken socialist culture. Lenin never relaxed his sharp criticism of decadent bourgeois culture. Currently, on the ideological front, just like on other fronts, imperialism is waging a sharp struggle against us. Any paralysis in this regard would be very harmful. We in the Chinese intellectual circles are willing to work together with you and move forward hand in hand.

The Chinese people have learned many beneficial things from the Soviet Union's revolutionary experience and experience in economic and cultural construction, and will certainly continue to learn many beneficial things in the future. After the October Revolution, Lenin put forward such a task for the Soviet Communist Party: study, study, and study again. Comrade Mao Zedong also called on us to be good at learning. We believe that as long as we are good at learning with an open mind, the historical task of building China into a strong socialist industrial country can certainly be accomplished. The great will of the people of China and the Soviet Union to advance side by side cannot be stopped by any force.

Dear Comrades, as I conclude my speech, let me once again express my gratitude for your warm reception.

I wish your school greater achievements in cultural education and scientific research!

I wish Soviet culture and science to prosper under the leadership of the glorious Soviet Communist Party!

Long live the great and unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!

Long live invincible Marxism-Leninism!

    周总理在莫斯科大学的讲话
    苏联的文化革命和建设的基本经验对中国人民极其有益
    我们将在巩固社会主义制度的斗争中发展社会主义文化亲爱的校长彼得罗夫斯基院士同志亲爱的教授同志们亲爱的学生同志们：
    今天，我们中华人民共和国政府代表团有机会到苏联的最高学府、举世闻名的苏联国立莫斯科大学来参观，并且在这里同大家会见，这使我们感到莫大的兴奋和愉快。
    谢谢你们对于我们的热烈欢迎，我们把这种欢迎看作苏联知识界对于中国知识界的最深厚的友谊的表现。请允许我以中国知识界——中国的科学和教育工作者、中国的大学生和青年的名义，向你们，并且通过你们，向苏联的整个知识界、苏联的大学生和青年致敬！
    你们授给我名誉学位，这不仅是我个人的光荣，也是中国人民的光荣。我自己的知识和能力都很不够，对接受这种荣誉的学位，是不相称的。但我将这种好意看成是对我的鼓励和督促。我将为了世界和平，为了我们共同的共产主义事业，更加努力地学习和工作。
    我们很敬慕你们的学校。这个由俄罗斯“科学之父”罗蒙诺索夫创立的并且以他的名字命名的学校，长期以来，是你们祖国的先进科学和文化的中心。在过去的年代里，在这里学习过和工作过的有许多俄罗斯先进的思想家和社会活动家，杰出的文学家和科学家，像莱蒙托夫、奥斯特洛夫斯基、赫尔岑、别林斯基、屠格涅夫、契呵夫、茹科夫斯基、季米里亚泽夫等，他们对于促进人类文化的进步，丰富人类的知识宝库，作出了可贵的贡献。而在苏维埃年代里，你们学校在苏联共产党和政府的关怀下更获得极其巨大的发展，成为苏联最大的高等教育和科学研究机关。在这里，每年都培养出数量很大的专家和科学工作者。他们不断地补充到苏维埃知识分子的队伍里，为丰富和创造社会主义的文化并使之为共产主义服务而进行着创造性的光荣的劳动。
    我们也很感谢你们的学校。在这里，同苏联青年一起学习的有几百个中国青年。这些中国青年，都是我们国家为了培养他们成为具备先进的科学和技术知识的人才而派遣到你们国家来的。正像在苏联其他高等学校学习的中国青年一样，他们在苏联教师的培养和苏联同学的帮助之下，正在努力学习苏联的先进的科学和技术，并且同苏联教师和青年建立了亲密的友谊。中国人民把你们的这种帮助看作是苏联人民对于中国的社会主义建设的巨大援助的组成部分之一。为了使他们不辜负我国人民的期望，也不辜负你们对他们的帮助，我希望你们更多地督促他们好好学习。
    正像你们已经知道的一样，中国人民把自己的革命和建设事业，看作伟大的十月革命的继续。在革命和建设的事业中，苏联是中国的榜样。就文化方面来说，苏联的文化革命和建设的基本经验，对于中国人民从来就是极其有益的。我们中国的文化还很落后。为了建设社会主义，实现社会主义工业化，我们特别需要大批具有专长的知识分子，由他们来帮助发展和创造社会主义文化，而这种人才旧中国给我们遗留下来的却是很少。全国解放以来，我们尽了很大的力量发展教育事业，特别是高等教育事业。几年来我们培养了三十万以上的高等学校学生。我国高等学校的学生已从1949年的十一万六千人增长到1956年的三十八万多人。但是，无论在数量上或者是质量上，我们还是感到建设人才远远不能满足国家的需要。我们从苏联的日益繁荣和昌盛的科学文化的经验中，看到了我们中国自己的社会主义文化的发展道路。我们将在坚持和巩固社会主义制度的斗争中发展和创造我国的社会主义文化。
    同志们，尽管在十月革命以前，你们的学校里曾经出现过许多先进的思想家和学者，但是，正是因为他们自觉或者不自觉地坚持了唯物的观点，把人类的前途寄托在人民群众的身上而不是寄托在当时的腐朽的、反人民的阶级身上，他们的遭遇和从事学术研究的条件经常是很不幸和困难的。只有到了十月社会主义革命以后，这种情况才起了根本的变化。社会主义国家的建立，给人类的文化史展开了新的一页，给苏联的文化和科学的发展开辟了无限宽广的道路。只有到了这个时候，马克思列宁主义才能够成为各种科学的指导思想，使各种科学获得迅速的发展。这也就是四十年来在苏联共产党的领导下，苏联的文化和科学从沙皇时代的落后状态达到世界最先进的水平的主要原因。这一事实是谁也否认不了的。
    当然，在文化科学领域内我们不应该故步自封，列宁曾多次告诉我们要善于吸取人类文化中一切好的东西，但是我们也要善于区别哪些是真正有益的，哪些是带有毒素的。为了推动文学和艺术的发展，我们中国提出了“百花齐放”和“百家争鸣”的方针。当然，我们这样作是为了发展和丰富社会主义文化，而决不是为了取消或者削弱社会主义文化。列宁从来也没有放松过对于腐朽的资产阶级文化的尖锐批判。目前在思想战线上正如同在其他战线上一样，帝国主义同我们正在进行尖锐的斗争。在这一方面的任何麻痹，都会是十分有害的。我们中国知识界愿意同你们共同努力，携手前进。
    中国人民在苏联的革命经验和经济文化建设的经验中曾经学习到许多有益的东西，而且今后一定还会继续学到许多有益的东西。十月革命以后，列宁给苏联共产党提出了这样的任务：学习，学习，再学习。毛泽东同志也号召我们，必须善于学习。我们相信，只要善于虚心地学习，把中国建设成为一个强大的社会主义工业国的历史任务是一定能够完成的。中苏两大国人民并肩前进的伟大意志是任何力量所不能阻止的。
    亲爱的同志们，在我结束我的谈话的时候，让我再一次对于你们热情的接待表示感谢。
    祝你们的学校在文化教育和科学研究事业中获得更大的成就！
    祝苏联的文化科学在光荣的苏联共产党的领导下日益繁荣！
    中苏两国人民伟大的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    战无不胜的马克思列宁主义万岁！
