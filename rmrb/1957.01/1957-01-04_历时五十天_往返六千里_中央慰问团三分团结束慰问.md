Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 3rd: The Central Delegation's Third Sub-Delegation has completed its慰問 (wèiwèn - expressing sympathy and solicitude) activities in the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province.

During the fifty-plus days of the visit, the delegation traveled from the Minjiang River basin in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to the Tao River basin in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, climbing snow-capped mountains, crossing grasslands, and traveling more than six thousand li. They went deep into the vast rural areas and pastures of thirteen counties, including Wenchuan, Li County, Mao County, Heishui, Songpan, Ma'erkang, Da Jin, Xiao Jin, Zhuosi Jia, Aba, Ruo'ergai, and Luqu and Maqu in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. They conveyed the cordial greetings of the Central Government and Chairman Mao to more than 90,000 people from all walks of life, including Tibetan, Qiang, Han, and Hui ethnic groups, and publicized and explained the ethnic policies.

In each location, the delegation held symposiums for middle and upper-level figures, symposiums for government cadres, symposiums for young women, symposiums for the masses, and symposiums for family members of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel. They also visited some prominent leaders of various ethnic groups, carefully listened to their opinions and requests, and classified and organized their opinions and requests for submission to local Party and government organs at all levels. Some of these issues have already begun to be resolved and addressed by the local Party and government organs.

The delegation distributed 5 million jin of relief grain and 4,000 sets of winter clothing to impoverished people of all ethnic groups, provided alms in the Lama temples, presented "Nie Tie" to the mosques, and gave慰問 gifts to government cadres, troops, and others.

The delegation's acrobatics troupe, braving the severe cold of minus ten to twenty degrees Celsius, often disregarded the fatigue of traveling and performed for the people of all ethnic groups in the open air immediately after getting off the vehicle. The delegation's medical team and film team also treated diseases and screened films for the people of all ethnic groups, respectively.

After the delegation conducted cordial visits and explained the Central Government's ethnic policies in detail, it dispelled the past doubts of certain ethnic minority leaders and greatly boosted the confidence of people of all ethnic groups in moving towards socialism.

    中央慰问团三分团结束慰问
    新华社成都3日电　中央慰问团第三分团已经完成了在四川省阿坝藏族自治州的慰问活动。
    慰问团在五十多天的慰问期间，从长江上游的岷江流域到黄河上游的洮河流域，爬雪山，过草地，往返六千多里：深入到汶川、理县、茂县、黑水、松潘、马尔康、大金、小金、绰斯甲、阿坝、若尔盖及甘南藏族自治州的碌曲和玛曲等十三个县的广大农村和牧场，向藏族、羌族、汉族、回族各界九万多人，传达了中央和毛主席对他们的亲切关怀，宣传解释了民族政策。
    慰问团每到一地，都召开了中上层人士座谈会、机关干部座谈会、青年妇女座谈会、群众座谈会和烈属军属座谈会，访问了各民族的一些公众领袖，认真地听取了他们的意见和要求，并且把他们的意见和要求分类整理出来，交给当地各级党政机关；其中有些问题，当地党政机关已经开始解决和处理。
    慰问团向各族贫苦人民发放了救济粮五百万斤、寒衣四千套，在喇嘛寺放了布施，给清真寺赠送了
  “乜贴”，给机关干部、部队等赠送了慰问品等。
    慰问团的杂技队，在摄氏零下十几度到二十多度的严寒下，往往不顾行路的疲劳，下车后就在露天里给各族人民演出。慰问团的医疗队和电影队，也分别给各族人民治了病，放映了电影。
    慰问团进行亲切慰问和较详细地宣传中央的民族政策以后，消除了某些民族领袖人物过去存在的疑虑，大大地鼓舞了各族人民向社会主义迈进的信心。
