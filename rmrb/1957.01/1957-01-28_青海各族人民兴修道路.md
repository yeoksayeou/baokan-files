Xinhua News Agency, Xining, January 26th: Leading departments at the county level in Qinghai Province are actively guiding people of all ethnic groups to build county and township roads. In the past year, the province's masses have built 606 kilometers of cart roads (animal-drawn carts) that can accommodate large flatbed carts. Together with the cart roads built previously, there are now a total of 1,636 kilometers.

Although the highway construction in Qinghai Province has developed rapidly, it still cannot meet the needs. Leading departments at the county level in Qinghai Province, adhering to the principles of "relying on the masses, using local materials, adapting to local conditions, and being economical and practical," are actively guiding the masses to build one cart road after another. In the pastoral area of Tianjun County, there was not a single road that could be used by animal-drawn carts in 1955. Now, cart roads have been built between all seven tribes under the county's jurisdiction.

    青海各族人民兴修道路
    据新华社西宁26日电　青海省各县级领导部门积极指导各族人民兴修县乡道路，去年一年全省由群众自己动手修起的、能通行大板车（兽力车）的大车道就有六百零六公里。连同以前修的大车道共有一千六百三十六公里。
    青海省的公路建设虽然有了迅速的发展，但是仍然不能满足需要，青海省各县级领导部门本着“依靠群众、就地取材、因地制宜、经济适用”的原则，积极指导群众修起一条又一条的大车道。在牧业区的天峻县1955年没有一条可以通行兽力车的道路，现在全县所属七个部落之间都已经修起了大车道。
