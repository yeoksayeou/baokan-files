    Mapping of Geological Blank Area in Northern Yangtze River Three Gorges Completed
    (Our report) The 435 Team of the Ministry of Geology has formally submitted the "Summary Report of the Geological Blank Area in the Northern Yangtze River Three Gorges" to the state at the end of January. From then on, the geological maps on both sides of the Yangtze River Three Gorges were connected into one piece. The geological blank area in the northern Yangtze River Three Gorges includes Zhushan, Zhuxi, Fangxian, Baokang, Nanzhang, Gucheng, Wuxi and other counties in western Hubei and eastern Sichuan. This is a place with high mountains, dense forests, and few people. For decades, it has been a blank area on the Chinese geological map. In order to provide the geological data needed for the Yangtze River Basin planning and the Yangtze River Three Gorges Hydropower Hub Project, all the staff of the 435 Team of the Ministry of Geology accepted this arduous task. From June to November last year, a total of 14,000 square kilometers of 1:500,000 geological maps were produced. From November last year to January this year, the writing of the summary report was completed.
    The places where the field staff passed are the meeting points of the Daba Mountains, Wushan Mountains, Jing Mountains, and Wudang Mountains, with high mountains and deep valleys, and relative heights of up to seven or eight hundred meters. These places are often uninhabited for hundreds of miles. In order to obtain correct geological data, the geological personnel traveled back and forth across the watershed between the Yangtze River and the Han River, which is more than 3,000 meters high, overcoming the difficulties caused by the severe heat and rainstorms in the summer of last year. On the border of Sichuan and Hubei, it had already snowed in early autumn, but the geological personnel still persisted in their work. Finally, the work task was completed as scheduled in November last year.
    The members of the 435 Team also discovered a large number of minerals, including ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, and non-metallic minerals. Now the Hubei Provincial Bureau of Geology has sent people to further conduct general surveys and exploration.

### 长江三峡北部地质空白区填图完成

    长江三峡北部地质空白区填图完成
    本报讯　中央地质部四三五队已在1月底正式向国家提交了“长江三峡北部地质空白区的总结报告”。从此长江三峡两岸的地质图就连成了一片。长江三峡北部地质空白区包括鄂西川东的竹山、竹溪、房县、保康、南漳、谷城、巫溪等县。这是一个山高林密、人迹罕至的地方。数十年来，在中国地质图上一直是一片空白。为了提供长江流域规划和长江三峡水力枢纽工程所需要的地质资料，地质部四三五队全体职工接受了这项艰巨任务。从去年6月到11月，共计测制五十万分之一的地质图一万四千平方公里。去年11月份到今年1月，又完成了总结报告的编写工作。
    在野外工作人员走过的地方都是大巴山、巫山、荆山、武当山的交会的地方，山高谷深，相对比高达七八百公尺。这些地方往往是百里无人烟。地质人员为了得到正确的地质资料，曾经往返于高达三千公尺以上的长江与汉水的分水岭上，克服了去年夏季的酷暑和暴雨所造成的困难。在川鄂边境，初秋就已经降雪，地质人员仍旧坚持着工作。终于在去年11月如期完成了工作任务。
    四三五队的队员，还发现了大量的矿产，包括黑色金属、有色金属和非金属矿。现在湖北省地质局已经派人前去进一步普查和勘探。
