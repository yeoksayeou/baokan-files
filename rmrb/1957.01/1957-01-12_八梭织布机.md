    Eight-Shuttle Loom

    Jiang Shuming of the Loom Workshop of the Changchun No. 2 Wood Furniture Production Cooperative has recently created an eight-shuttle loom.

    This loom is simple to use and flexible to operate. Ordinary technicians can also operate it freely, and it can weave eight colors and sixteen patterns of plaid cloth. Previously, the most used thread shuttles for weaving plaid cloth were three, which could only weave three colors and five patterns. Implementing the method of manually changing shuttles sometimes easily leads to errors in specifications and patterns, often producing defective products. The eight-shuttle loom does not make mistakes with lines or patterns. Using the eight-shuttle loom to weave cloth can increase output by more than double, while also reducing the physical labor of workers and lowering costs by more than 25%. If weaving cloth of one color, each person can simultaneously supervise more than fifty machines.

    八梭织布机
    长春市第二木器家具生产合作社，织布机车间姜树明，最近创造出八个梭子的织布机。
    这种织布机使用简单，操作灵活，一般的技术工人也能操纵自如，能织八种颜色十六种花样的花格布。以前织花格布最多的是三个线梭，只能织三种颜色，五种花样。实行双手换梭的操作方法，有时容易织错规格和花样，常出废品。八梭织布机不错线，不错花样。用八梭织布机织布，产量能提高一倍多，还减轻了工人的体力劳动，降低成本25％以上。如果织一种颜色的布，每人同时可看管五十台机以上。
