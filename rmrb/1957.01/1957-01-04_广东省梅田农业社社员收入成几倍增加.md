The income of members of the Meitian Agricultural Cooperative in Guangdong Province has increased several fold.

(Reported by Southern Daily) The Meitian Agricultural Cooperative in Haikang County, Guangdong Province, which won the 1955 National Model Agricultural Producer Award from the Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China, saw its total agricultural income from the early and late rice crops in 1956 increase by more than double that of 1955, and its total sideline income increase by more than three times that of 1955. The remuneration for each workday reached 1.62 yuan. Among the 405 member households in the cooperative, the income of 198 households increased by one to three times compared to 1955, the income of 170 households increased by three to six times, and the income of 15 households increased six times.

The significant increase in production in the Meitian Cooperative in 1956 was mainly due to the conversion of approximately 1,000 mu of single-crop fields into double-crop fields. At the same time, 100 mu of wasteland were reclaimed, and single-seedling close planting or small-clump close planting and other advanced cultivation techniques were realistically adopted in all rice fields, changing the previous backward sowing method. A large amount of fertilizer accumulation and application, and the digging of more than 30 artesian wells to eliminate the historical drought, were also important reasons for obtaining a large increase in production.

In 1956, the total agricultural income of the cooperative was equivalent to more than 1,734,000 jin of grain, an increase of more than double compared to the 824,000 jin of income in 1955. The average yield per mu for the whole year (including sweet potatoes converted to grain) was 790 jin, and the total sideline income for the whole year was more than 8,900 yuan.

    广东省梅田农业社社员收入成几倍增加
    本报讯　据南方日报报道：获得中华人民共和国农业部1955年度增产模范奖的广东省海康县梅田农业社1956年早晚两造农业总收入比1955年增加一倍以上，副业总收入比1955年增加三倍以上。每个劳动日的报酬达到一元六角二分。全社四百零五户社员，有一百九十八户的收入比1955年增加一倍到三倍以下，有一百七十户增加三倍到六倍以下，有十五户增加六倍。
    梅田社1956年大增产，主要是由于把一千亩左右的单造田改为双造田，同时开垦了一百亩荒地，全部稻田实事求是地采用了单株密植或者小科密植等先进耕作技术，改变了过去落后的撒种方法。大量积肥施肥，打了三十多眼自流井，消灭了历史性的旱灾，也是获得大量增产的重要原因。
    1956年全社农业总收入折谷一百七十三万四千多斤，和1955年收入八十二万四千多斤比较，增产一倍以上。全年平均每亩（连番薯折谷计算）收谷七百九十斤，全年副业总收入八千九百多元。
