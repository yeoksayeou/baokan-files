    Educating Employees to Recognize the Correct Relationship Between Developing Production and Improving Living Standards
    Wenzhou Straw Mat Factory's Use of Accounting and Comparison Methods Proves Highly Successful
    (Reported by this newspaper) The leaders of the local state-owned Wenzhou Straw Mat Factory used accounting and comparison methods to educate workers on the relationship between developing production and improving living standards, achieving significant results.
    Since the third quarter of last year, when the factory began to pay attention to the issue of "caring for people" and implemented wage reforms, the lack of timely ideological education led some workers to develop overly high and urgent demands for improving their living standards. They felt that the recent wage increase was too small, and some workers, in pursuit of higher wages, were restless and wanted to switch factories.
    The factory leadership studied and analyzed this situation and concluded that the workers' excessive and urgent demands stemmed from a lack of comprehensive understanding of the country's economic situation and the factory's production development, as well as an incomplete understanding of the relationship between developing production and improving living standards. In fact, the living welfare of the factory's employees had greatly improved over the past few years, even exceeding the rate of the factory's production development. Therefore, they adopted a detailed accounting method to educate workers on the relationship between developing production and improving living standards. They presented the workers with three detailed accounts. First, from 1952 to the present, the factory accumulated more than 66,000 yuan for the state, while the state has allocated 72,000 yuan to the factory from 1953 to the present. The factory's total profits turned over in 1956 did not even offset the increased expenditures after the wage reform. Second, the living welfare of the factory's employees has improved year by year. For example, female workers' living expenses were 117 yuan in 1952, 422 yuan in 1953, 868 yuan in 1954, and increased to more than 1,000 yuan in 1956. At the same time, the nursery and barber shop were expanded, a health clinic was established, and labor protection contracts were implemented. In the past, expensive medicines were paid for by individuals, but now expensive medicines used by sick employees are paid for by the enterprise. The employee welfare expenses in 1956 were higher than in previous years. The state stipulates that welfare expenses should account for 7.5% of the total wage, but the actual expenditure in the third quarter of last year reached 15%. Third, taking the workers who weave pillow mats as an example, the average output per person was ten mats in 1951, and now they can weave eighteen mats, an 80% increase in labor productivity; while wages have increased from an average of less than 20 yuan in 1951 to more than 30 yuan, so wage growth is not slow.
    After explaining the factory's income and expenditure situation, as well as the growth rate of labor productivity, employee wages, and living welfare, many people were deeply moved. Many people recalled that when they entered the factory in 1951, their lives were not good enough, and everyone ate sweet potato stems. Now the factory has a canteen, and everyone eats white rice. Some female workers also said that when they first joined the factory, their children slept next to the mat-making machine, but now they can entrust their children to the nursery. Some workers said with emotion: "If we had known the factory's situation earlier, not to mention that our living standards have not improved slowly, even if they had improved more slowly, we would not have any objections." The workers expressed their determination to be diligent and thrifty and adhere to the style of hard work and simplicity.
    At the same time, the employees also realized that in order to seek greater improvements in their lives, they must strive to increase production, practice strict economy, and strive for greater development of production. Once the workers' understanding was improved, their enthusiasm for increasing production and practicing economy quickly surged, and they requested to learn and improve their skills. The leadership promptly organized the workers to sign more than one hundred pairs of various technical assistance contracts and mobilized the workers to put forward rationalization proposals to solve key problems in increasing production and practicing economy. For example, workers proposed changing the square-cornered rolled-edge pillow mats to round-cornered rolled-edge pillow mats. After the promotion of this suggestion, twenty-three bolts of bleached cloth have now been saved. According to the needs of users, the employees also used 40,000 jin of short mat grass and waste mat grass, which were previously regarded as waste materials, to make children's pillow mats and foldable travel mats, which not only solved the difficulty of raw material shortage but also increased the income by more than 1,000 yuan. Various departments and workshops also paid attention to streamlining staffing and saving non-productive expenditures. As a result, the factory reversed its recent loss-making situation and increased the profit for the state by more than 2,000 yuan. (According to Zhejiang Daily)

### 教育职工认清发展生产和改善生活的正确关系   温州草席厂用算账对比方法非常成功

    教育职工认清发展生产和改善生活的正确关系
    温州草席厂用算账对比方法非常成功
    本报讯　地方国营温州草席厂的领导人利用算账对比的方法，向工人进行关于发展生产和改善生活的关系的教育，收到很大的效果。
    这个厂自从去年第三季度注意了“关心人”的问题和实行工资改革以后，由于思想教育工作没有及时跟上去，部分工人对改善生活产生过高过急的要求，嫌这次工资增加得太少，有的工人为了追求更高的工资，不安心在本厂工作，想跳厂。
    厂的领导上对这种情况研究和分析的结果，认为工人所以产生这种过高过急的要求，主要是对国家的经济情况和厂里生产发展的情况缺乏全面的了解，对发展生产和改善生活的关系缺乏完整的认识。实际上这个厂几年来职工生活福利已有很大的改善，甚至已经超过了该厂生产发展的速度。于是便采取了算细账的方法向工人进行发展生产和改善生活的关系的教育。他们向职工群众算了三笔细账。第一笔：这个厂从1952年到现在，共计为国家积累资金六万六千多元，而国家从1953年到现在已为这个厂拨款七万二千元。1956年这个厂上缴的全部利润还抵不上工资改革以后增加的支出数字。第二笔：这个厂的职工生活福利逐年都有改善。例如，女工生活费1952年是一百十七元，1953年是四百二十二元，1954年是八百六十八元，1956年增加到一千多元。同时，还扩大了托儿所、理发室，办起了卫生室，实行了劳保合同。过去贵重药品由本人负担，现在职工本人患病所用的贵重药品改由企业支付。1956年支出的职工福利费比历年都高，国家规定福利费占工资总额的7.5％，但去年第三季度的实际支出已达到15％。第三笔：单以织枕席的工人为例，1951年平均每人织十粒，现在能织十八粒，劳动生产率提高80％；而工资已从1951年的平均不到二十元增加到三十多元，工资增长并不算慢。
    通过算细账向工人说明了厂里的收支情况以及劳动生产率和职工工资、生活福利增长的比例后，许多人很受感动。许多人回忆1951年进厂时，当时生活还不够好，大家都吃番薯干，现在厂里有了食堂，大家都吃白米饭。一些女工也说自己刚进厂时，孩子睡在制席机旁边，现在可以把孩子交给托儿所了。有的工人感动地说：“早知道厂里的情况，莫说我们生活的改善不慢，就是慢一些，我们也不会有意见的。”工人们表示要克勤克俭，坚持艰苦朴素的作风。
    同时，职工们也认识到，要想求得生活的更大改善，就得努力增加生产，厉行节约，争取生产的更大发展。工人们的认识一经提高，增产节约的热情就迅速高涨，纷纷要求学习和提高技术。领导上及时组织工人签订了一百多对各式各样的技术互助合同，并且发动工人提合理化建议。解决增产节约方面的关键问题。比如，工人提出把方角滚边枕头席改为圆角滚边枕头席的建议，推广以后，现在已节约白漂布二十三匹。职工们还根据用户的需要，把四万斤过去被当作废料的短席草和废席草用来做儿童枕头席和能折叠的旅行席，既解决了原料缺乏的困难，还增加了一千余元的收入。各科室、车间也注意了紧缩编制，节约非生产性的开支。结果使这个厂扭转了最近以前亏本的局面，为国家增加了二千多元的利润。　（据浙江日报）
