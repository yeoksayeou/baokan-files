    Fighting Soil and Water Loss
    Anhui has Controlled Over a Thousand Square Kilometers of Soil Erosion Area
    (Our dispatch) Anhui Province's soil and water conservation work has seen significant development over the past year. In the soil and water conservation year ending September 1956, the province completed 44,965 mu of field projects, afforested 1,498,607 mu of land by closing hillsides to facilitate afforestation, built 10,224 check dams, and 5,799 silt-detention dams. Relying on these projects and other soil and water conservation measures, the province has initially controlled soil erosion in an area of 1,268.9 square kilometers, exceeding the task indicators set by the central government.
    In areas with severe soil erosion, various soil and water conservation projects have yielded significant benefits. Jia Shan Tao in Xiao County is an area with serious soil erosion. Over the past year, through afforestation, terracing, and the construction of many check dams, slow-flow dams, and embankment nests, the area of soil erosion initially controlled is 5 square kilometers. According to on-site surveys by the Yonggu Hydrological Station, under the same rainfall conditions as in 1955, the main ditch within the area saw a 70% reduction in runoff, a 25% reduction in sediment content, and an 83% reduction in scouring. The Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative, which resides here, has 3,500 mu of cultivated land. Originally, the average yield per mu was only 50 to 60 jin. After constructing water-conserving, soil-conserving, and fertilizer-conserving field soil and water conservation projects, and adopting other technological reforms, the average yield per mu increased to 200 jin last year. The Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Hongshan Township, Yuexi County, built more than 29 mu of terraced fields, increasing the average yield per mu from 271 jin to more than 500 jin, with a total output increase of 84% compared to before the terraces were built. A production team of the Wuqi River Forestry, Agriculture, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Huoshan County converted barren, abandoned land into level terraced fields. The corn planted yielded more than 100 jin per mu compared to neighboring fields.
    Over the past year, Anhui Province's soil and water conservation work has been carried out in accordance with the principle of "focusing on pilot projects, creating models, moving from points to areas, and gradually expanding." (Cao Yizheng)

    同水土流失现象作斗争
    安徽已控制水土流失面积千余平方公里
    本报讯　安徽省水土保持工作一年来有显著发展。在截至1956年9月底为止的水土保持年度中，全省已完成田间工程四万四千九百六十五亩，封山育林一百四十九万八千六百零七亩，兴建谷坊一万零二百二十四座，淤地坝五千七百九十九座，依靠这些工程和其他一些水土保持措施，全省已初步控制了水土流失面积一千二百六十八点九平方公里，超额完成中央规定的任务指标。
    在水土流失较严重的地区，各种水土保持工程起到了显著效益。萧县夹山套是个水土流失严重的地区，一年来，经过造林和整修梯田，兴建许多谷坊、缓水坝、埝窝，初步控制的水土流失面积有五平方公里。据永堌水文站的实地勘测，在和1955年同等雨量情况下，套内主沟减少70％的径流，减少25％的含沙量和83％的冲刷。居住在这里的红光农业生产合作社，有三千五百亩耕地，原来每亩地平均产量只有五十到六十斤，经过兴建保水、保土、保肥等田间水土保持工程，再加上采取其他的技术改革以后，去年每亩平均产量提高到二百斤。岳西县红山乡前进农业社修筑了二十九亩多梯田，每亩平均产量由二百七十一斤提高到五百多斤，总产量比改梯田以前增加84％。霍山县舞旗河林农牧生产合作社的一个生产队，把贫瘠的抛荒地改成水平梯田以后，种的玉米，每亩比邻近的田多收一百多斤。
    一年来，安徽省的水土保持工作是按照“重点试办，做出典型，由点到面，逐步开展”的方针进行的。　（曹以正）
