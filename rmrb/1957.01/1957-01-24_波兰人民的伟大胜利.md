From Warsaw comes encouraging news: in the Polish parliamentary elections held on January 20, the candidates nominated by the Polish National Unity Front won an absolute victory. The main members of the Central Leading Organs of the Polish United Workers' Party and all nominated central-level candidates were elected as members of parliament in this election. This is a victory for the Polish people, a victory for the Polish socialist cause, and a victory for the Polish United Workers' Party. The Chinese people, with brotherly feelings, wholeheartedly congratulate the Polish people on their great victory in this election struggle.

The Polish election demonstrates the great determination of the Polish working people for the socialist cause. In this election, the list of all parliamentary candidates was jointly proposed by the Polish United Workers' Party and other democratic parties and people's organizations after full consultation and deliberation. This list reflects the leading role of the Polish working class and its party in the political life of the country, and also reflects the will and interests of the broadest sections of the country. According to the provisions of the election law, voters not only could put forward any opinions and demands to their candidates before the election, but also fully enjoyed the right to freely choose candidates guaranteed by the Constitution in the election. In this election, the number of voters who participated in the voting accounted for 94.14% of all voters, of which 98.4% voted for the candidates of the National Unity Front. This fact fully demonstrates the political enthusiasm of the Polish people and their high trust in the Polish National Unity Front, especially the Polish United Workers' Party.

The Polish election was a struggle between democracy and anti-democracy, socialism and anti-socialism. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Polish United Workers' Party made great efforts to correct the mistakes and shortcomings in its past work, to make Poland's socialist cause more in line with Poland's national characteristics, and to enable the friendly relations between Poland and the Soviet Union to achieve healthy development. However, reactionary forces at home and abroad took the opportunity to carry out various sabotage activities. They used the mistakes and shortcomings in the past work of the Polish Party and government and the current temporary economic difficulties to try to achieve their heinous anti-socialist goals in this election. The propaganda organs of Western countries sent more than 100 journalists to Poland to conduct interviews, and they constantly released pessimistic sentiments unfavorable to the Polish working people before the election. The Associated Press of the United States claimed that the current situation in Poland was "more unstable than at any time after the war" and carried out various slanders against the Polish United Workers' Party. The "Radio Free Europe" controlled by the United States spread a large number of inflammatory lies to Poland before the election, openly attacked the Polish United Workers' Party, and even issued "pre-election instructions" demanding that the Polish people boycott the election and prevent the candidates of the Polish United Workers' Party from being elected. At the same time, domestic counter-revolutionaries in Poland also spread rumors and slanders, attacked the candidates of the National Unity Front, and created various incidents to undermine the election. The reactionary forces at home and abroad in Poland carried out this kind of activity with the obvious purpose of undermining Poland's socialist cause and leading Poland to the dead end of capitalism. Under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Polish working people waged a resolute struggle against the enemy's sabotage activities. The result of the election was a serious blow to reactionary forces at home and abroad in Poland. The Polish people are determined to take the socialist road, so they wholeheartedly support the Polish United Workers' Party. They know that only because of the leadership of this party can their war-torn motherland be rapidly revived, Poland's independence be guaranteed, and Poland's socialist construction cause achieve great achievements. They also know that the reason why the Polish United Workers' Party bravely admits the shortcomings and mistakes in its work is precisely to be responsible for the interests of the people and to do its best to improve Poland's economic and political situation. The Polish people's support for the candidates of the National Unity Front, which is dominated by the Polish United Workers' Party, is also supporting the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party and supporting Poland's socialist development path.

The results of the Polish parliamentary elections are of great significance for the further development of Poland's socialist cause. It will further consolidate the unity of the Polish United Workers' Party and its leading position in the national life, further strengthen the position of the Polish working class in the struggle against reactionary factions at home and abroad, stabilize the domestic political situation in Poland, and enhance the confidence of the Party and the people in working hard to overcome current difficulties. Soon after, Poland's new parliament will hold a meeting and elect a new government. We congratulate the new Polish state organs on their new achievements in uniting the people of the country and in the struggle to build Poland's socialism.

    波兰人民的伟大胜利
    从华沙传来了令人鼓舞的消息：在1月20日举行的波兰议会选举中，波兰全国统一阵线所提出的候选人获得了绝对的胜利。波兰统一工人党中央领导机构的主要成员和全部被提名的中央一级候选人，都在这次选举中当选为议员。这是波兰人民的胜利，是波兰社会主义事业的胜利，也是波兰统一工人党的胜利。中国人民怀着兄弟般的感情，衷心祝贺波兰人民在这次选举斗争中的伟大胜利。
    波兰的选举表现了波兰劳动人民对于社会主义事业的伟大决心。在这次选举中，全部议员候选人的名单，是经过波兰统一工人党同其他各民主党派和人民团体充分协商酝酿后联合提出来的。这个名单体现了波兰工人阶级及其政党在国家政治生活中的领导作用，也反映了全国最广泛阶层的意志和利益。按照选举法的规定，选民不但可以在选举之前向自己的候选人提出任何意见和要求，并且在选举中完全享有宪法所保证的自由选择候选人的权利。在这次选举中，参加投票的选民占全部选民的94.14％，其中有98.4％选举了全国统一阵线的候选人，这个事实充分说明了波兰人民的政治积极性和他们对于波兰全国统一阵线特别是对于波兰统一工人党的高度信任。
    波兰的这次选举是一场民主和反民主、社会主义和反社会主义的斗争。在波兰统一工人党八中全会以后，波兰统一工人党为改正过去工作中的错误和缺点，为了使波兰的社会主义事业更加符合波兰的民族特点，为了使波兰和苏联的友好关系获得健全的发展，曾作了重大的努力。但是，波兰国内外的反动势力却乘机进行各种破坏活动。它们利用波兰党和政府过去工作中的错误和缺点以及目前的暂时的经济困难，企图在这次选举中达到它们反社会主义的罪恶目的。西方国家的宣传机构这次派出了百余名记者到波兰去进行采访，他们在选举以前不断放出不利于波兰劳动人民的悲观空气。美国合众社宣传目前波兰的情况“比战后任何时候都不稳定”，并对波兰统一工人党进行各种诽谤。美国控制的“自由欧洲电台”在选举前对波兰散布了大量煽惑性的谎言，公开攻击波兰统一工人党，甚至发出了“选举前的指示”，要求波兰人民抵制选举，不让波兰统一工人党的候选人当选。同时，波兰国内的反革命分子也大肆造谣污蔑，打击全国统一阵线的候选人，制造各种破坏选举的事件。波兰国内外的反革命势力进行这种活动，目的显然想破坏波兰的社会主义事业，把波兰引向资本主义的绝路。波兰劳动人民在波兰统一工人党的领导之下，对敌人的破坏活动进行了坚决的斗争。选举的结果，对波兰国内外反动势力是一个严重的打击。波兰人民坚决要走社会主义的道路，因此它们衷心地支持波兰统一工人党。他们知道，只是由于这个党的领导，他们在战争中遍体鳞伤的祖国才得以迅速地复兴起来，波兰的独立才得到了保障，波兰的社会主义建设事业才得到了巨大的成就。他们也知道，波兰统一工人党之所以勇敢地承认自己工作中的缺点和错误，也正是为了对人民的利益负责，为了尽力改善波兰的经济状况和政治状况。波兰人民拥护以波兰统一工人党为主的全国统一阵线候选人，也就是拥护波兰统一工人党的领导，拥护波兰的社会主义发展道路。
    波兰议会选举的结果，对于波兰社会主义事业的进一步发展具有重大的意义。它将进一步巩固波兰统一工人党的团结和它在国家生活中的领导地位，进一步加强波兰工人阶级在同国内外反动派斗争中的地位，稳定波兰国内的政治局势，提高党和人民为克服当前困难而努力的信心。不久以后，波兰新的议会就要举行集会并推选新的政府。我们祝贺波兰新的国家机构在团结全国人民，在建设波兰的社会主义的奋斗中获得新的成就。
