An Overview of Australia
By Béchet, reporter for the French newspaper "L'Humanité"

Australia has 7,704,000 square kilometers, almost as large as the United States—7,828,000 square kilometers—but a population of just over nine million, while the United States has over 168 million. The white population of Australia is concentrated in the fertile, narrow coastal areas. In these areas, the first British immigrants drove out the original owners—the Aboriginal people—one hundred and fifty years ago. The dry inland areas, mostly desert, are sparsely populated. When it rains, most desert areas flourish, but sometimes it doesn't rain for five or six years. During these dry periods, these areas revert to desolate, barren landscapes. Therefore, central Australia needs huge irrigation systems to keep the land fertile.

The island continent of Australia was once connected to Asia, but the original land bridge was submerged, and the three thousand islands of Indonesia are now its remnants. This land bridge may have sunk due to drastic geological changes in prehistoric times.

Since the sinking of the land bridge connecting it to Asia, the animal and human life on the Australian continent has developed independently for thousands of years, cut off from the rise and fall of Eurasia. Those familiar with human history would describe Australia as "a place forgotten by time." Stone Age humans and prehistoric animals and birds that have disappeared in Eurasia still exist here. The Australian Aborigines still remain in the Stone Age of humanity. They are nomadic hunters in a tribal stage, but they have a social organization that allowed them to unite consistently when the white people arrived. How many of these Aborigines there used to be is unknown. It is estimated that there were between 300,000 and 1,000,000. Now there are only about 30,000 left. Their best hunting grounds were taken away, they themselves were hunted like animals, their water sources were poisoned, and they were driven into the desert regions. The fate of the Australian Aborigines is the most shameful page in Australian history. To this day, no action has been taken to correct the crimes of the past. The average Australian never sees Aborigines living far from residential areas in their lifetime. Studying the habits of Australian Aborigines allows us to understand humanity's past. Engels cited many published materials about Aborigines in his classic work "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State" to illustrate the development of the family and the state.

When the land bridge sank, it was in the middle of the development of animals and birds. At this time, carnivorous animals had not yet arrived in Australia. Therefore, many animals that would normally be eaten by carnivores still exist here. There are fish with wings that can fly like birds. They also have gills and can stay in the water for a long time. There are furry mammals that resemble platypuses. They are comfortable both in water and on land. They lay eggs, but the hatched young grow by suckling. There are marsupials like kangaroos and possums that give birth shortly after pregnancy and then immediately put the newborns into a pouch attached to the mother's body. The mammary glands are hidden in this pouch. The young live in this protective pouch and do not want to leave even when they can hop. There are animals like "flying foxes" with degenerated, flight-capable wings that allow them to glide long distances between treetops. These bizarre animals and birds can be seen in the Melbourne Zoo and Sydney's famous Taronga Zoo.

In 1770, after British Captain Cook acquired the privilege of the east coast, the first white immigrants to Australia were political prisoners, who landed in 1788. From then until 1867, for almost a century, Britain used Australia as a penal colony for political prisoners. The first to be exiled to Australia were sympathizers of the French Revolution. During the decades when exile was prevalent, political "troublemakers" accounted for the majority of convicts, including Chartists from England, Ireland, and Wales, farmers and workers who dared to organize trade unions in the village of Tolpuddle and later fled, Irish warriors who fought for independence from Britain, and European refugees who fled to Australia to escape the bloody suppression after the European unrest of 1848. In those days, British farmers who stole a rabbit from a landowner to survive could also be exiled.

British military officers and colonial officials managing the colonial convicts gradually drove out the Aborigines and plundered the land. Employers used the unpaid labor of convicts to develop these lands, building grand houses and farm buildings. Most of the senior officers and officials were sons of landed gentry and gentlemen from Britain, who were often sent to Australia after committing economic and social misdeeds in Britain. Because abundant pastures could be obtained without spending a penny, and because convict ships brought unpaid labor, appetite was quickly stimulated. Thus, on land stolen from the Aborigines, using the unpaid labor of convicts bound by chains, Australia developed and built its livestock and wool industry. Australia had 126 million sheep in 1956, mostly concentrated in the hands of a few hundred families, whose ancestors were the rulers, open plunderers, and exploiters of the early immigrant convicts. From these scandals, Australia now exports high-quality wool, accounting for about three-quarters of its production and about half of the world wool market sales.

In 1851, the discovery of Australia's rich gold mines brought new incentives for immigration and development. This factor attracted immigrants from all over the world, mostly from Britain, but also from the European continent, which was then divided by revolution and counter-revolution. Gold miners opposed unreasonable taxes, and free immigrants united against aristocratic mine owners and British troops. In the famous Eureka Stockade uprising in 1854, miners in Ballarat fought with British soldiers (Eureka was the name of a gold mine; Ballarat is about one hundred kilometers from Melbourne). The miners waged a heroic and prolonged struggle and finally achieved their goals. All the poor free immigrants united under their banner. The British conceded, abolished the unreasonable taxes, agreed to end the convict system, and allowed immigrants the right to elect their own parliament.

Inspired by the militant traditions of the Ballarat miners, the organized Australian working class gradually grew stronger. The great strike of the shearers (later supported by the dockworkers) added new strength to the solidarity of the working class. From 1891 to the present day, the history of the Australian working class shows that it is necessary to wage a brutal struggle to defend the fruits they have obtained in the past and to fight for the gradual improvement of working conditions (shearers went on another major strike last October). The decisive factor in the victory was the assistance of the dockworkers, who refused to load wool until the shearers' demands were met. Although the demand for an eight-hour workday was first put forward in Chicago, it was first implemented in Australia as a result of determined strikes.

Perhaps influenced by the progressive forces in Europe in the middle of the last century, the Australian working class movement is characterized by close unity between trade unions and a high degree of international solidarity. This international solidarity is particularly strong among dockworkers and seafarers. Anywhere in the world, the struggles of their comrades immediately become their own struggles. If a ship or its cargo is declared "black" by seafarers and dockworkers elsewhere in the world, then no Australian seafarer or dockworker will load or unload that ship. In 1938, when Japan launched its invasion of China, Australian seafarers and dockworkers launched a major strike, and with the support of other unions, forced Prime Minister Menzies to stop shipping minerals and supplies to Japan. In 1945 and 1946, workers refused to load Dutch ships docked in Australian ports carrying ammunition and troops to suppress the national liberation movement in Indonesia. Dockworkers and seafarers have repeatedly expressed sympathy for Chinese and Indian seafarers arriving in Australia, providing them with financial support until their demands were resolved. This action of the progressive Australian working class is also reflected in their frequent opposition to the reactionary government's shameful "White Australia" policy, which the reactionary government uses to maintain discrimination against Asians.

For the past twenty years, the current Prime Minister Menzies has boasted of crushing the Communist Party of Australia and has made many attempts, but always failed. In 1951 and 1952, during the tense period of the Korean War, Australia used newspapers to attack and oppose communism and enacted laws prohibiting communist activities. The Menzies reactionary bloc-dominated parliament passed this law. But the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional and overturned it. Menzies called for a plebiscite to change the constitution, giving him the necessary power to ban communist activities. But this was a fantasy. The majority of the people voted against banning the Communist Party in the plebiscite. No matter how arrogantly the Menzies government suppresses the Communist Party, the Communist Party's influence in the major trade unions is now stronger, and more and more communists are being elected to leadership positions in important trade unions.

Until World War I, Australia was an agricultural country. British capitalists did not want to build an industry in Australia that would compete with it. Livestock companies, banks, insurance companies, shipping companies, and coal mines were all in British hands. Australian agriculture was developed on a capitalist scale. A small number of operators with huge estates and herds of cattle and sheep lived a luxurious life in the cities, only occasionally visiting their properties during the shearing season. A large number of skilled workers have only a few weeks of work a year. On 500,000 hectares of land, several thousand livestock managers manage 126 million sheep and 15 million cattle owned by a few hundred families. At least half of Australians are concentrated in the large cities in the six states that form the Commonwealth, and 80% live in cities with populations of more than 40,000. Farms range in size from hundreds to thousands of hectares and are cultivated with tractors and combines. In the past half-century, more people have been engaged in commerce, banking, and the transportation of agricultural and mineral products than in production. The latest census data show that the total number of owners and agricultural workers who derive income from agriculture is 450,000, while the number of people in cities who derive income from wages and salaries is about 2,250,000. These figures are surprising because the country is the world's leading exporter of wool and also a major exporter of wheat, butter, meat, and other agricultural products.

During World War I, Australian industry received some stimulus because German submarines disrupted shipping between Britain and Australia. This effect lasted for a few years after the war. The stimulus of World War II was even greater. Because there was also war in Asia, not only was shipping disrupted, but Japan seriously threatened Australia. Britain, busy with European affairs, successively lost its colonies and bases in Asia. British capitalism lifted the restrictions on Australian industry. It not only hoped that Australian industry would be established to defend itself, but also hoped that Australia would supply the British war machine in Asia. This was a huge industrial upsurge. By the end of the war, Australia's own heavy industry was able to manufacture modern aircraft, tanks, and ships. Except for a few air raids in the underdeveloped north, the flames of war did not reach Australia, and its industry was intact. After the war, Australian industry developed steadily, even infiltrating Asian markets that were previously monopolized by the British.

Most of the new development projects are funded by Australian capitalists. British overall investment has also decreased. Since the end of the war, the Menzies government has opened the door to the infiltration of American capital, especially in the newly discovered uranium mines, oil fields, aviation industry, and automobile industry.

In the years after the war, Australia's industry and agriculture both benefited from sales, and the people had a better life. However, it can be said with certainty that Australia's prosperous period has passed. The consequences of the Menzies government's large-scale investment in military industry at the expense of the people's living conditions and social welfare are already clearly evident. Just by taking a closer look, underneath its surface of prosperity lie deep social evils.

    澳大利亚概貌
    法国“人道报”记者　贝却敌
    澳大利亚有七百七十万四千平方公里，几乎同美国——七百八十二万八千平方公里——一样大；但是，人口只有九百万多一点，而美国有一亿六千八百多万人。在澳大利亚的白种人集中在肥沃的狭长的沿海地带。在这些地方英国第一批移民在一百五十年以前赶走了原来的主人——土著居民。在干燥的内地，大都是沙漠，人口稀少。当下雨时，多数的沙漠地区出现欣欣向荣的生气，可是有时五、六年不下雨，在不下雨的时期，这些地区就恢复了平沙旷野的荒凉景象。因此，澳大利亚中部需要巨大的灌溉系统，才能使土地保持肥沃。
    澳大利亚的岛屿大陆曾一度与亚洲连在一起，原来的陆地桥梁被水淹没了，现在印度尼西亚的三千个岛屿就是它的遗迹。这个陆地桥梁可能是在史前时期由于地壳发生激变而下沉的。
    自从与亚洲连结的陆地桥梁下沉以后，澳洲大陆上的动物和人类的生活就单独地发展了几千年，与欧亚大陆的盛衰割断了关系。精通人类历史的人会把澳大利亚描写为“被时间所遗忘了的地方”。石器时代的人类，史前时期的动物，在欧亚大陆已经绝迹了的鸟类，在这里还存在着。澳大利亚的土著居民仍然停留在人类的石器时代，他们是处在种族部落阶段的游牧狩猎者，不过他们具有一种社会组织，当白种人到来的时候，能够一致地团结起来。这些土著人过去有多少是不知道的。据估计有三十万到一百万。现在大约只剩下三万人了。他们的最好的猎场被夺去了，他们自己好像动物一样被捕杀，他们的水源被放下毒药，他们被赶到沙漠的地区。澳大利亚土著人的遭遇是澳大利亚历史上最可耻的一页。一直到今天，还没有采取什么行动来纠正过去的犯罪的行为。普通的澳大利亚人终身没有见过离居民地区很远的土著人。研究澳大利亚的土著人的生活习惯，就可知道过去的人类。恩格斯在经典著作“家庭、私有制和国家的起源”中，曾引用了许多已经发表了的、有关土著人的材料，来说明家族和国家的发展。
    在陆地桥梁下陷时，正值动物与鸟类发展的中期，这时，肉食动物还没有到澳大利亚来，因此，按正常进化程序，许多会被肉食动物吃掉的动物在这里还存在着。这里有长着翅膀能像鸟一样飞翔的鱼，它也有鳃，能够长时间留在水中。这里有长着毛的、与鸭嘴兽相像的哺乳动物，无论在水中或是在陆地上都很自在，它们是卵生，可是孵出的幼兽依靠哺乳成长。这里有像袋鼠和小松鼠的有袋动物，它们怀孕不久就生产了，然后马上把生下来的幼鼠放进附在母亲体内的小袋子里，乳房就隐藏在这袋子里，幼鼠住在这个有保护性的袋子里，甚至于到了它们会跳跃的时候，还不肯离开。这里有像“飞狐狸”的动物，有退化了的、能飞的翅膀，在树顶作长距离间滑翔。这些稀奇古怪的兽类和鸟类，在墨尔本动物园和悉尼的著名的塔朗公园都可以看到。
    在1770年英国船长库克取得了东海岸的特权后，第一批到澳大利亚的白种移民是政治犯，他们是在1788年登陆的。从那时起直到1867年几乎有一个世纪，英国把澳大利亚当做政治犯的流放所。最初流放到澳大利亚来的有法国革命的同情者。在流放盛行的几十年间，政治上的“不良分子”占罪犯中的大多数，其中有英国、爱尔兰和威尔斯的宪章派分子，有敢于在托尔匹都村组织工会，后来逃走了的农民、工人，有争取摆脱英国而独立的爱尔兰战士，还有逃避1848年欧洲动乱后的血腥镇压而到澳大利亚来的欧洲自由难民。在那些日子里，英国的农民为了生活而从地主那里偷了一只兔子，也会被流放。
    管理殖民罪犯的英国军官和殖民的官员们逐渐地赶走土著人，掠夺了土地。雇主使用无偿的罪犯的劳动来开发这些土地，修建高大的房屋和农场建筑。多数高级军官和官员是英国的有土地的贵族和绅士的儿子，他们在英国干了经济上的和社会上的丑事而常被送到澳大利亚来。由于不花分文就能得到丰富的牧场，由于囚犯船只运来无偿的劳动力，很快地刺激了人们的胃口。这样就在从土著人那里抢来的土地上，利用了用锁链束缚去作工的罪犯的无偿的劳动力，澳大利亚发展了和建设了畜牧业和羊毛工业。澳大利亚1956年有一亿二千六百万只羊，多数集中在几百个家族手里，他们的祖先就是早期移民罪犯的统治者、公开的掠夺者和剥削者。从这些丑事开始，现在澳大利亚输出的品质优良的羊毛约占它的产量的四分之三，并且大约占世界羊毛市场销路的一半。
    1851年，澳大利亚丰富的金矿的发现，给移民和开发带来了新的刺激因素。这个因素吸引了世界各地的移民，大部分来自英国，也有来自当时正被革命和反革命所分裂的欧洲大陆。金矿工人反对不合理的捐税，自由移民团结起来反对贵族矿主和英国的军队。在1854年有名的欧勒克起义时，巴兰拉特的矿工与英国兵士发生了战斗（欧勒克是一个金矿的名称，巴兰拉特离墨尔本约一百公里）。矿工进行了英勇的长期斗争，最后达到了目的。所有贫穷的自由移民团结在他们的旗帜下。英国人让步了，取消了不合理的捐税，同意结束罪犯制度，允许移民有权利选举自己的议会。
    在巴兰拉特矿工的战斗性的传统的鼓舞下，有组织的澳大利亚的工人阶级逐渐壮大起来。在剪羊毛工人的大罢工（后来得到码头工人的支持）中，工人阶级的团结增添了新的力量。从1891年一直到今天，澳大利亚工人阶级的历史说明，必须进行残酷的斗争，保卫他们在过去得到的果实，为逐步改善工作条件而斗争（去年10月剪羊毛工人又进行了大罢工）。胜利的决定因素是码头工人的援助，码头工人在剪羊毛工人的要求没有得到满足以前，拒绝装运羊毛货物。虽然八小时工作制的要求最初是在芝加哥城提出来的，可是首先实施八小时工作制的是澳大利亚，这就是坚决罢工的结果。
    或许是受了上一个世纪中叶欧洲的进步力量的影响，澳大利亚工人阶级运动的特点是工会之间紧密的团结，高度的国际团结。这种国际的团结在码头工人和海员中特别巩固。在世界任何地方，他们的同志的斗争马上会变成他们自己的斗争。如果一艘船或它所载货物被世界其他地方的海员和码头工人宣布为“黑货”，那末就没有澳大利亚的海员和码头工人肯为这艘船装卸货物。1938年，当日本对中国发动侵略时，澳大利亚的海员和码头工人发动了大罢工，并得到其他工会的支持，迫使总理孟席斯停止把矿产和军需品装运到日本。1945和1946年，工人拒绝为停在澳大利亚港口的载运弹药和军队去镇压印度尼西亚的民族解放运动的荷兰船只装货。码头工人和海员多次表示同情到澳大利亚来的中国籍和印度籍的海员，在经济上支持他们，一直到他们的要求得到解决为止。进步的澳大利亚工人阶级的这种行动，也表现在他们经常反对反动政府的、可耻的“白澳”的政策上，反动政府用这个政策来维持对亚洲人的歧视。
    过去二十年来，现任总理孟席斯一直吹嘘要粉碎澳大利亚共产党，并作了很多尝试，但总是失败。在1951、1952年朝鲜战争紧张时期，澳大利亚利用报纸攻击和反对共产主义，制定了禁止共产党活动的法律。孟席斯反动集团占统治地位的议会通过了这个法律。但是最高法院认为它违背宪法而予以否决。孟席斯要求复决投票，改变宪法，使他握有必要的权力来禁止共产党活动。但这是空想，大多数人民在复决投票中投票反对禁止共产党。不管孟席斯政府多么狂妄地压制共产党，共产党在主要的工会中的影响现在更加强大了，愈来愈多的共产党员被选上了重要工会的领导地位。
    直到第一次世界大战时，澳大利亚还是一个农业国。英国的资本家不希望在澳大利亚建设起与它竞争的工业。畜牧公司、银行、保险公司、轮船公司和煤矿都在英国人手里。澳大利亚农业是在资本主义类型的规模上发展起来的。握有巨大产业、牛羊群的一小撮经营者，在城市里过着奢侈的生活，仅仅在剪羊毛的时候，偶然去看看他们的产业。有大批熟练的工人一年只有几个星期的工作。在绵亘五十万公顷的土地上，几千个家畜管理人管理着几百个家族所拥有的一亿二千六百万只羊和一千五百万头牛。至少有一半的澳大利亚人集中在形成自治领的六个州中的大城市里，80％住在四万人口以上的城市。农庄拥有土地从几百公顷到几千公顷不等，都用拖拉机和康拜因机耕种。在过去半世纪里，从事商业、银行以及农产品、矿产运输的人比生产的人为多。上次普查材料说明，依靠农业得到收入的所有者和农业工人，共有四十五万人，而城市中依靠工资和薪水收入的人却约有二百二十五万人。这些数字是令人吃惊的，因为这个国家出
  口羊毛占世界首位，同时也是小麦、黄油、肉类和其他农产品的主要出口国之一。
    第一次世界大战期间，由于德国的潜水艇破坏了英国和澳大利亚之间的航运，澳大利亚的工业得到了某些刺激。这种影响在战后延持了几年。第二次世界大战的刺激还要大些。因为亚洲也有战争，不仅航运受阻，而且日本严重地威胁着澳大利亚。忙于欧洲事务的英国相继地失去了在亚洲的殖民地和基他。英国的资本主义解除了加在澳大利亚工业上的束缚，它不但希望澳大利亚的工业建立起来，保卫自己，并且希望澳大利亚供给英国战争机器在亚洲的需要。这是一次巨大的工业的高涨。在战争结束前后，澳大利亚自己的重工业已能制造现代化的飞机、坦克和船舰。除了不发达的北方遭受过几次空袭外，战火没有燃烧到澳大利亚，它的工业是完整无损的。战后，澳大利亚的工业稳步地发展，甚至于渗入了过去由英国人独占的亚洲市场。
    新的开发事业大都是由澳大利亚资本家出钱的。英国的全面投资也减少了。自战争结束以来，孟席斯政府为美国资本的渗入打开了大门，特别是在新发现的铀矿、油田、航空业、汽车工业等方面。
    战后几年来，澳大利亚的工业和农业都在销售方面获得了利益，人民有着较好的生活。但是，可以肯定地说，澳大利亚的繁荣的时期已经过去了。孟席斯政府损害人民的居住条件和社会福利来对军事工业大量投资，它的后果已经很明显地表现出来了。只要深入地观察一下，在它的繁荣的表面下，包藏着深重的社会罪恶。
