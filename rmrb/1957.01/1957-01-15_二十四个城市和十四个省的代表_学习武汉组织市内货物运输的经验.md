Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 13th: Wuhan's experience in organizing intra-city freight transport has garnered significant attention nationwide. From January 9th to 11th, over two hundred representatives from transportation departments in twenty-four major cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Harbin, Xi'an, and Guangzhou, and fourteen provinces, including Liaoning, Hebei, and Jiangsu, as well as all railway administrations nationwide except for Chongqing and Kunming, gathered here to observe and learn from Wuhan's experience.

In the past, Wuhan's various intra-city transportation forces operated independently, each reporting to its own dispatching organization. As a result, various transportation capacities often failed to connect seamlessly during freight transport, frequently resulting in vehicles waiting for people, and ships waiting for vehicles, leading to significant waste of transport capacity. After June 1955, under the leadership of the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee, the Municipal Transport General Dispatch Office was established to centrally manage freight consignment registrations within the city and oversee the monthly and daily transport plans and dispatching work of various transport forces. Initially, only major transportation tools such as automobiles and ships were under the unified command of the General Dispatch Office. Last year, as tricycles, pushcarts, horse-drawn carts, and other transport forces were organized into cooperatives, all transport forces in the city came under the control of the General Dispatch Office. This greatly reduced the waste of transport capacity and improved the efficiency of transport tools. Last year, Wuhan's overall automobile transport capacity increased by only 1.3% compared to 1955, while the volume of goods transported by automobiles increased by 189% compared to 1955. The transport capacity of ships increased by only 46%, while the volume of goods completed increased by 126%.

While unifying the dispatch of transport forces, Wuhan, adhering to the principle proposed by the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party that local transport tools should be subordinate to the needs of trunk line transport, and trunk line transport should assist local transport tools, formulated and adhered to the practice of connecting intra-city transport with transportation trunk lines in the Wuhan area. The General Dispatch Office also established joint dispatching groups at major stations, specifically to organize the work of cargo entering and leaving major stations. The phenomenon of cargo congestion that frequently occurred at railway stations in the past has thus been fundamentally changed. Last year, none of the stations in Wuhan for which intra-city transport tools were responsible for receiving and transporting goods experienced any congestion.

    二十四个城市和十四个省的代表
    学习武汉组织市内货物运输的经验
    据新华社武汉13日电　武汉市组织市内货物运输的经验，受到全国各地的重视。从1月9日到11日，北京、天津、上海、哈尔滨、西安、广州等二十四个大城市和辽宁、河北、江苏、等十四个省的运输部门，以及全国除重庆、昆明以外的各铁路管理局的代表共二百多人齐集这里，观摩学习了武汉市的经验。
    过去武汉市市内各种运输力量都是各立门户，各自听命于自己的调度机构。因此，在货物运输过程中各种运力经常不能紧密衔接，常常是车等人，船等车，造成运力的大量浪费。1955年6月以后，在武汉市人民委员会领导下成立了市内运输总调度室，统一受理市内货物运输的托运登记，统一掌握市内各种运输力量每月、每日的运输计划和调度工作。开始的时候，还只有汽车、轮船等主要运输工具受总调度室的统一指挥。去年，随着三轮车、板车、马车等运输力量组织成为合作社，全市各种运输力量就全部由总调度室掌握起来了。这样，就大大减少了运力浪费，提高了运输工具的效率。去年，武汉市全市汽车运力只比1955年增加了1.3％，而汽车运输的货物量却比1955年增加了189％；轮船的运力只增加46％，而完成的运量却增加了126％。
    武汉市在统一调度运输力量的同时，本着中共武汉市委提出的地方运输工具应该服从干线运输需要，干线运输应该帮助地方运输工具的方针，制定并且坚持了武汉地区市内运输同交通干线衔接的做法。总调度室还在各主要车站成立了联合调度组，专门具体组织各主要车站进出货物的工作。过去各铁路车站常常发生的货物堵塞现象因而有了根本的改变。去年一年内，武汉市凡由市内运输工具负责接运货物的车站，都没有出现过堵塞现象。
