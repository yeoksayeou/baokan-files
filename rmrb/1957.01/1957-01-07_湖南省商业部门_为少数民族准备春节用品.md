Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 4th. The commercial departments in the ethnic minority regions of Hunan Province are actively preparing to supply special commodities needed by ethnic minorities during the Spring Festival.

4,500 bolts of silk scarves for head wrapping by the Miao, Dong, and Yao peoples have been purchased from Hankou. Slab sugar, red yeast rice fish, black salt fermented soybeans and other foods needed by the Miao and Dong peoples for the Spring Festival are being processed in large quantities in Changde, Xupu and other places. The Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture Company of the China National Department Store recently sent people to Sichuan to purchase lace for the Miao people to decorate their new clothes for the Spring Festival.

In November 1956, the commercial departments in ethnic minority areas organized investigation groups with the participation of ethnic minority cadres to conduct in-depth investigations to understand the requirements of ethnic minority people for commodity varieties and specifications.

In the fourth quarter of 1956, the People's Bank of Hunan Province and relevant commercial departments also allocated 4,000 taels of pure silver to process jewelry for ethnic minority women.

    据新华社长沙4日电　湖南省各少数民族地区的商业部门，正在积极准备供应少数民族春节期间特殊需要的商品。
    苗族、侗族和瑶族人民缠头的丝帕，已经从汉口采购了四千五百匹。苗族和侗族人民春节需要的片糖、红曲鱼、黑盐豆豉等食品，正在常德、溆浦等地大量加工。中国百货公司湘西苗族自治州公司最近还派人到四川采购苗族人民过春节装饰新衣用的花边。
    1956年11月间，在少数民族聚居区的商业部门，曾经组织了有少数民族干部参加的调查组，深入了解少数民族人民对商品品种、规格的要求。
    湖南省人民银行和有关商业部门，在1956年第四季度还拨出纯银四千两，为少数民族妇女加工首饰。
