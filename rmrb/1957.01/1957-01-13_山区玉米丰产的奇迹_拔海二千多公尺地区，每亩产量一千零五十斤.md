Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Dispatch: The Changzheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lan'an Township, Luding County, Sichuan Province, achieved an average yield of 1,050 *jin* per *mu* on 152 *mu* of mountain land planted with corn last year. This is more than twice the average yield of corn in the local area that year, setting the highest record for corn yield per unit area in the province. Cadres of the CPC Ya'an Prefectural Committee, who recently conducted a special investigation of this cooperative, wrote in their report: some of the corn stalks in this cooperative are so thick that they can be used to carry a small load of water; one corn cob weighs twelve *liang*. They believe this is a miracle of corn abundance in mountainous areas.

The area where this cooperative is located is more than 2,400 meters above sea level, with a cold and dry climate and a frost period of up to six months each year. The fundamental reason they were able to achieve high yields of corn under such harsh natural conditions is agricultural cooperativization. The cooperative members believe that after cooperativization, they had the conditions to change old farming methods and adopt scientific technologies. Last year, when they planted corn, they first changed from using old plows to double-wheeled, double-furrow plows; and changed from using wooden mallets to break up soil clods to using iron rakes to rake the soil. In this way, they could not only plow two or three inches deeper than in the past, but also turn hard soil into loose soil, allowing the corn roots to stretch further and absorb enough water and fertilizer. Secondly, they adopted improved varieties, and also adopted advanced cultivation techniques such as "warm water soaking of seeds," "seed dressing with medicine," "appropriate close planting," and "artificial assisted pollination," and increased the application of fertilizer and the number of times of inter-row cultivation and weeding, thus achieving high yields.

    山区玉米丰产的奇迹
    拔海二千多公尺地区，每亩产量一千零五十斤
    新华社成都电　四川省泸定县岚安乡长征农业生产合作社，去年在一百五十二亩山地里种植的玉米，每亩平均产量达到一千零五十斤。比当地当年一般玉米的每亩平均产量高出两倍多，创造了全省玉米单位面积产量的最高纪录。最近到这个社进行了专门调查的中共雅安地委的干部写回来的报告说：这个社有的玉米杆粗壮得可以挑起一小担水；一个玉米“棒子”有十二两重。他们认为这是山区玉米丰产的奇迹。
    这个社所在的地区拔海二千四百多公尺，气候寒冷干燥，每年的霜期长达六个月。在这样比较恶劣的自然条件下，他们能够取得玉米高额丰产的根本原因，是农业合作化。社员们认为：合作化以后他们有了改变旧的耕作方法和采用科学技术的条件。去年，他们种植玉米时，首先改旧犁犁地为双轮双铧犁犁地；改木棰打土块为铁耙耙土。这样，不但可以比过去深耕两三寸，而且还能使硬土变成松土，使玉米根部更能伸长，以吸收足够的水份和肥料。其次，他们采用了良种，还采用了“温汤浸种”、“药剂拌种”、“适当密植”、“人工辅助授粉”等先进栽培技术，并增施了肥料和增加了中耕除草次数，因而获得了高额丰产。
