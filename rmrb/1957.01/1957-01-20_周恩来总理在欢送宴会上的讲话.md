Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Farewell Banquet

Dear Chairman Comrade, dear comrades and friends:

Our delegation's visit to the Soviet Union has been met with a grand welcome and warm reception from the Soviet government and the Soviet people. Everywhere we can feel the fraternal friendship of the great Soviet people towards the Chinese people. I would like to take this opportunity to once again express my heartfelt thanks to the Soviet government and the Soviet people.

This year, 1957, is the fortieth anniversary of the victory of the great October Revolution. Under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people have overcome unparalleled difficulties, built the first socialist country, and are victoriously building a communist society. The Soviet Union has made great efforts to help China and other socialist countries build socialism. The Soviet Union has given great support and made significant contributions to the movements of oppressed nations and dependent countries around the world striving for independence, and to the movements of people around the world striving for peace. For forty years, the world-significant achievements and contributions of the great Soviet people cannot be denied or ignored by anyone.

The great October Revolution brought Marxism to the Chinese people and paved the way for the victory of the Chinese revolution. The Chinese people have received sincere fraternal assistance from the Soviet Union in socialist construction. The victory and achievements of the Chinese people are inseparable from the support and help of the great Soviet people.

Communism and proletarian internationalism have closely linked our two countries. An unbreakable fraternal friendship has been established between our two countries. From their own personal experience, the Chinese people deeply understand that the eternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union is in the interests of our two peoples and all progressive mankind.

Recently, we visited the fraternal countries of Poland and Hungary. Our visit has once again confirmed our unwavering belief that the unity of socialist countries, based on the principles of national equality and proletarian internationalism, is unshakable, and the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is the most reliable guarantee of world peace and human progress.

With the joint efforts of socialist countries, the close unity of the international proletariat has been further strengthened. Socialist countries are working hard to build socialism and communism. Socialist countries and all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world have formed a huge force to defend world peace. The world will definitely move towards progress, the difficulties on the road forward will surely be overcome, and no force in the world can stop us from advancing.

Comrades, friends, I propose:

For the unbreakable friendship and unity between the Chinese and Soviet people,

For the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,

For friendship among the peoples of all countries and world peace,

For the strength and prosperity of the Soviet Union, the strong fortress of world peace,

To the health of Comrade Voroshilov, Comrade Bulganin, Comrade Khrushchev, and other comrades, leaders of the Soviet government and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union!

    周恩来总理在欢送宴会上的讲话亲爱的主席同志，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    我们代表团这次来苏联访问，受到了苏联政府和苏联人民的隆重欢迎和热情接待。我们处处都可以体会到伟大苏联人民对于中国人民的兄弟友谊。我愿意借这个机会再次向苏联政府和苏联人民表示衷心的感谢。
    今年，1957年，是伟大的十月革命胜利后的第四十年。苏联人民在光荣的苏联共产党的领导下，克服了无可比喻的困难，建成了第一个社会主义的国家，并且正在胜利地建设着共产主义的社会。苏联对于帮助中国和其他社会主义国家建设社会主义，作了极大的努力。对于全世界被压迫民族和附属国争取独立的运动，对于全世界人民争取和平的运动，苏联都给予了巨大的支持，作出了重大的贡献。四十年来，伟大苏联人具有世界性意义的成就和贡献，是不容任何人抹煞和忽视的。
    伟大的十月革命给中国人民带来了马克思主义，为中国革命的胜利开辟了道路。中国人民在社会主义建设中从苏联得到了真诚的兄弟的援助。中国人民的胜利和成就是同伟大苏联人民的支持和帮助分不开的。
    共产主义、无产阶级的国际主义把我们两国紧密地联系了起来。我们两国之间已经建立了牢不可破的兄弟友谊。中国人民从自己亲身的体验里，深深地了解到，中苏两国之间的永恒的友谊是符合于我们两国人民和全体进步人类的利益的。
    最近，我们访问了波兰和匈牙利两个兄弟国家。我们的访问再一次证实了我们坚定不移的信念：建立在民族平等和无产阶级国际主义的原则基础上的社会主义各国的团结是不可动摇的，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结是世界和平和人类进步的最可靠的保证。
    在社会主义各国的共同努力下，国际无产阶级的亲密团结进一步加强了。社会主义各国都正在为建设社会主义和共产主义而努力。社会主义国家和世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民已经形成了一支保卫世界和平的巨大力量。世界将肯定地走向进步，前进的道路上的困难是一定会被克服的，世界上没有任何力量能够阻止我们前进。
    同志们，朋友们，我建议：
    为中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊和团结，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结，
    为各国人民之间的友好和世界和平，
    为世界和平的坚强堡垒苏联的强大和繁荣，
    为苏联政府和苏联共产党的领导人伏罗希洛夫同志、布尔加宁同志、赫鲁晓夫同志和其他各位同志的健康干杯！
