    Shenyang Air Compressor Factory Improves Product Performance
    An improved 300-horsepower air compressor increases exhaust volume by three cubic meters per minute and reduces installation area by twelve square meters.
    (Our Newspaper News) The Shenyang Air Compressor Factory has already changed the structure and improved the performance of two of its five main products.
    In the past, due to poor sealing and ventilation in air compressors, the amount of compressed air per minute did not meet theoretical design requirements. For example, the theoretical design compression capacity (i.e., exhaust volume) of a 300-horsepower air compressor was 40 cubic meters per minute, but it only actually reached 38 cubic meters; the theoretical design of a 190-horsepower air compressor should compress 20 cubic meters of air per minute, but it only actually reached 19 cubic meters. In addition, due to other structural defects, the manufacturing process consumed too much material, and the usage process consumed too much electricity.
    Under the encouragement of the slogan "Marching towards science," the technical personnel gave full play to their bold creativity and carried out comprehensive transformations on the 300-horsepower and 190-horsepower machines, making the product structure economical and reasonable, and the performance was also significantly improved. The air compression capacity of the 300-horsepower air compressor has been increased to 41 cubic meters per minute, and the area occupied by the plant has been reduced from 26 square meters to 14 square meters, which can save more than 2,000 yuan in plant investment. The electricity consumption per hour during usage is also reduced by one-tenth compared to before. The new 300-horsepower air compressor has already been manufactured in several units, and the trial-produced 190-horsepower air compressor is being prepared for production. The technical transformation of other products has been included in the technical personnel's work agenda. Factory Director Ji Hequn said when evaluating the significance of this technical improvement: "The saving in the manufacturing process of a machine is a one-time saving, while the saving in the usage process is a multiple saving. Although this saving cannot be reflected in our factory's costs, it still creates more wealth for the country." (According to the Liaoning Daily)

    沈阳空气压缩机厂提高产品性能
    一台改进后的三百马力空气压缩机，每分钟排气量提高三立方公尺，安装面积少用十二平方公尺
    本报讯　沈阳空气压缩机厂五种主要产品已有两种改变了结构，提高了性能。
    过去，空气压缩机由于封闭不严、通气不畅，每分钟压缩空气的数量没有达到理论设计的要求。如三百马力的空气压缩机理论设计每分钟压缩能力（也就是排气量）是四十立方公尺，实际上只达到三十八立方公尺；一百九十马力空气压缩机理论设计每分钟应该压缩空气二十立方公尺，实际只达到十九立方公尺。另外，由于结构上其他方面的缺点，制造时消耗材料过多，使用时耗用电力过多。
    在“向科学进军”的口号鼓舞下，技术人员发挥了大胆创造精神，在三百马力和一百九十马力两种机器上进行全面的改造，使产品结构经济合理，性能也有显著提高。三百马力的空气压缩机每分钟压缩空气的能力提高到四十一立方公尺，占用厂房的面积由二十六平方公尺降低到十四平方公尺，可以节约二千多元的厂房投资，在使用时每小时耗用电力也比以前减少十分之一。一百九十马力的空气压缩机每分钟压缩空气的能力由过去的十九立方公尺提高到了二十一立方公尺，使用时电力消耗由每小时一百七十度降低到一百六十度。现在新型的三百马力空气压缩机已经制出数台，试制成功的一百九十马力的空气压缩机正准备投入生产，其它几种产品的技术改造工作已经被列入技术人员的工作日程。厂长吉合群在评价这项技术改进的意义时说：“机器在制造过程中的节约是一次的，在使用过程中的节约是多次的。这种节约虽然不能反映到我们厂的成本上，但从国家来说还是多创造了财富。”　（据辽宁日报）
