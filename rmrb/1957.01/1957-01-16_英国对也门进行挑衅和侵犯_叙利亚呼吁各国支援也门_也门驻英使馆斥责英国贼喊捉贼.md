Xinhua News Agency, 15th Dispatch from Damascus: Syria, on the 14th, in a note submitted to the diplomatic envoys of various countries in Syria, requested that countries take action in the United Nations to help Yemen resist British aggression.

The note stated: "British provocations and encroachments on the Yemeni border constitute acts of armed aggression."

The note pointed out: "First, British troops are carrying out unusual gatherings along the Yemeni border, which indicates non-peaceful intentions. Second, Britain is waging an economic war against Yemen, with the aim of undermining Yemen's economy and creating chaos in the country. Third, British troops are repeatedly launching attacks on the people of the nine Arab protectorates in the Arabian Peninsula, in order to disintegrate the national movement there and create an atmosphere conducive to the expansion of British military operations."

The note said in the fourth point that all indications in this region show that Britain is turning the nine Arab protectorates in the Persian Gulf into an imperialist base in order to concentrate its forces there, which constitutes a lasting threat to the security and sovereignty of Middle Eastern countries.

The note also called on countries to be vigilant against the serious events that may threaten peace in the Middle East due to the British military invasion of Yemen.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th Dispatch from London: The Yemeni Embassy in Britain issued a statement on the 14th refuting Britain's accusation in a letter distributed to UN member states on the 11th that Yemen was instigating so-called riots in the Aden Protectorate. The statement said: "This accusation is without any basis. It is merely to distort the facts and seize the opportunity to exert spiritual and military pressure on Yemen."

The statement asked: "Yemen has no aircraft, tanks, or armored motorcycles. Could it attack another country that possesses modern weapons, including rockets and other destructive weapons, and has already used these weapons in the region?"

The statement also said: "On the same day that Britain distributed this letter (January 11), British military aircraft and tanks attacked and fired on Yemeni strongholds in Moaman. The losses and casualties caused by this attack are not yet known. British troops are currently still attacking Yemen's Dare Bak from Beihan."

It was learned here on the 14th that Britain has increased its troops on the Yemeni-Aden border, and two infantry companies have been sent to the border area. Yemen has repeatedly condemned Britain for frequently launching attacks on Yemen from the Aden Protectorate since last December and has filed complaints with the United Nations.

According to a British Foreign Office spokesperson on the 14th, British and Yemeni negotiators will meet on the Yemeni border soon to try to stop the conflict between Yemeni and British troops. The spokesperson said that "arrangements are being discussed" for holding the talks.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th Dispatch from Cairo: Yemeni Minister to Egypt, Taleb, told reporters on the evening of the 14th that British aggression against Yemen entitles Yemen to abolish the Anglo-Yemeni Treaty.

Taleb said that the British attack on Yemen "proves that Britain does not respect these treaties." He said: "We have not yet abolished these treaties, however we have the right to do so at any time we choose."

    英国对也门进行挑衅和侵犯
    叙利亚呼吁各国支援也门
    也门驻英使馆斥责英国贼喊捉贼
    新华社15日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚14日在一份送交各国驻叙利亚外交使节的照会中，要求各国在联合国采取行动，帮助也门抵抗英国的侵略。
    照会说：“英国对也门边境的挑衅和侵犯构成了武装侵略行为”。
    照会指出：“第一，英国军队正沿着也门边境进行不寻常的集结，这就表明了非和平的意图。第二，英国正在对也门发动一次经济战争，目的在于破坏也门的经济，并且在这个国家制造混乱。第三，英国军队正在向阿拉伯半岛上九个阿拉伯保护地的人民一再发动进攻，以瓦解那里的民族运动，并且制造便于英国军队扩大行动的气氛。”
    照会在第四点中说，在这个地区中的一切迹象表明，英国正在把波斯湾的九个阿拉伯保护地变成一个帝国主义基地，以便在那里集中它的部队，这样就构成了对中东国家的安全和主权的持久威胁。
    照会还要求各国警惕由于英国军队进犯也门而可能引起威胁中东和平的严重事件。
    新华社15日讯　伦敦消息：也门驻英国公使馆14日发表声明，驳斥英国11日在散发给联合国会员国的一封信中硬说也门在亚丁保护地煽动所谓骚乱的指责。声明说：“这种指责是没有任何根据的，这不过是为了歪曲事实，并且抓住机会对也门施以精神的和军事的压力。”
    这篇声明问道：“也门没有飞机、坦克，也没有装甲摩托车。难道它可能进攻另一个拥有包括火箭和其他毁灭性武器在内的新式武器、而且已经在这个地区使用了这些武器的国家吗？”
    这篇声明还说：“就在英国散发这封信的同一天（1月11日），英国的军用飞机和坦克向也门在莫阿曼的据点进攻和开火。这次袭击所造成的损失和伤亡现在还不知道。英国部队目前仍在从贝汉向也门的达雷巴赫进攻。”
    这里14日获悉，英国已经在也门和亚丁边境增兵，两个步兵连被派往边境地区。也门已经一再谴责英国从去年12月以来经常利用亚丁保护地向也门发动进攻，并且向联合国提出了控诉。
    据英国外交部发言人14日说，英国和也门的谈判代表不久将在也门边境会晤，以设法停止也门和英国军队之间的冲突。发言人说，举行会谈的“安排正在讨论中”。
    据新华社15日讯　开罗消息：也门驻埃及公使塔列布14日晚间对新闻记者说，英国对也门的侵略使也门有权废除英—也条约。
    塔列布说，英国进攻也门“证明了英国不尊重这些条约”。他说：“我们还没有废除这些条约，然而我们有权在我们所选择的任何时候这样作。
