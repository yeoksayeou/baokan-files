Guangdong Province achieved another great victory on the grain production front in 1956. The total grain output of the province is estimated to reach 24 billion jin (excluding soybeans), an increase of approximately 2.1 billion jin compared to 1955. This is the year with the largest increase in grain production in the history of Guangdong Province.

In 1956, the average grain yield per unit area in Guangdong Province increased by about 5.5% compared to 1955. Many areas set new records for yield per unit area last year. In the Chaoshan Plain, although affected by drought and untimely fertilizer supply, Chao'an, Chenghai, and Chaoyang counties still maintained the glorious title of "Thousand-Jin Grain Counties" they received the previous year. Puning and Jieyang counties also achieved an average grain yield of 1,000 jin per mu. Hainan, Hepu, and the Leizhou Peninsula, which have always had backward cultivation techniques and low yields per unit area, also saw hundreds of thousand-jin grain high-yield cooperatives in 1956. Dongling Agricultural Cooperative in Tunchang County, Hainan, Zhongzhai Agricultural Cooperative in Chengmai County, Duowen Agricultural Cooperative in Lingao County, and Hongguang and Hongqi Agricultural Cooperatives in Tuonan Township in the suburbs of Shantou City all set new records for double-cropping rice yield per unit area, breaking the national record of 2,012.6 jin per mu of double-cropping rice set by Yunguangg Agricultural Cooperative in Jieyang County in 1955. This shows that there is still potential for further increasing yield per unit area in high-yield areas of Guangdong Province, and even greater potential for increasing production in low-yield areas.

Guangdong Province has particularly advantageous natural conditions, but it is also a province prone to disasters. In 1956, on the basis of achieving agricultural cooperativization, Guangdong Province leveraged various favorable conditions and overcame various natural disasters, thus achieving a great victory in grain production.

Increasing the multiple cropping index is an important measure for Guangdong Province to achieve increased grain production. Most of the land in Guangdong can achieve three crops a year. Increasing the multiple cropping index mainly involves expanding the winter planting area and changing single-crop fields to double-crop fields. In the winter of 1955, the province planted 17.5 million mu of winter crops, an increase of 3.5 million mu compared to the winter planting area in 1954. Due to the strengthening of field management of winter crops, wheat, miscellaneous grains, and other crops all achieved good harvests. The spring harvest of grain increased by more than 700 million jin compared to 1955, accounting for one-third of the total increase in grain production in the province in 1956. In 1956, the province converted 2.18 million mu of single-crop paddy fields into double-crop fields. The planting area of double-crop fields doubled compared to 1955, and most of them achieved increased production.

The farming experience of farmers in the Chaoshan area of Guangdong is well-known throughout the country, but in many other areas of Guangdong, primitive farming systems are still retained, and farming methods are extremely extensive, resulting in extremely unbalanced yields. High-yield areas reach 1,000 jin or even more than 2,000 jin per mu, while low-yield areas only yield 100 jin or even only dozens of jin per mu. In 1956, on the basis of cooperativization, Guangdong Province actively summarized and promoted advanced farming experiences centered on the high-yield areas of Chaoshan, and reformed backward farming systems and farming methods. In February, Guangdong Province convened the First Agricultural Labor Model Conference, which concentrated on systematically summarizing and exchanging various aspects of increased production experience; at the same time, it held a provincial agricultural production exhibition to introduce the achievements and main experiences of Guangdong Province on the agricultural production front over the years. Then, using the exhibits as teaching materials, eleven farmer training classes were held, training more than 30,000 agricultural technology reform personnel. More than 1,300 agricultural technology extension stations were established throughout the province. Through the technical extension stations in various places, the province also trained approximately one million person-times of farmer technicians. These measures enabled various advanced farming experiences to be widely disseminated. Therefore, the achievements made in reforming farming systems and promoting advanced technologies in 1956 far exceeded those of any previous year. Such as changing intercropping of rice to continuous cropping, changing broadcasting to row sowing or transplanting, changing mixed sowing to separate sowing, implementing small-scale close planting, etc. In addition, the area for promoting improved rice varieties more than doubled compared to 1955. From the perspective of the increased production effect in the past year, the implementation of these measures has been basically successful. In 1956, it is estimated that 1.7 million mu of rice converted from intercropping to continuous cropping can increase rice production by 200 million jin. Changing broadcasting fields to row sowing or transplanting has increased yields by more than double the original yield in some areas.

In 1956, the total amount of farm manure accumulated by farmers in Guangdong Province, including river mud, pond mud, sea mud, and wild green manure, reached more than 4.2 billion dan, an increase of more than three times compared to 1955. However, these farm manure were mainly concentrated on the early rice crop. Due to the untimely supply of commercial fertilizers, some areas experienced a shortage of fertilizer for the late rice crop.

The call by the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee to basically eliminate drought within seven years has been warmly supported by farmers throughout the province. In more than three months, through methods such as digging wells, ponds, and building reservoirs, the newly added irrigation area reached more than 3 million mu, more than double the original plan; the original plan to improve irrigation was 2.6 million mu, but the result was more than 6 million mu. Last year, Wushi District of Haikang County dug more than 3,600 field wells, which freed more than 4,000 mu of dry land from drought. Eighty out of the 86 agricultural cooperatives in the district achieved bumper harvests.

Guangdong Province has also made great achievements in the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests. The main experience lies in accurately grasping the occurrence pattern of the rice stem borer, the most harmful insect to rice. Eliminating overwintering borers so that they lose their hiding places. According to statistics, the province adopted methods such as digging rice roots and flooding fields to eliminate overwintering borers on an area of more than 27.8 million mu, an increase of more than six times compared to 1955. Last year, early rice used early-maturing varieties, appropriately advanced planting, and late rice was transplanted after the peak of the third generation of moths, avoiding the season when borers were severely harmful. In addition, a comprehensive insect control campaign was launched, involving the masses to carry out manual killing and chemical spraying. As a result, the borer damage rate of rice decreased from 6% last year to below 2%. In 1956, the state's multifaceted economic support to farmers was also an important factor in Guangdong's increased grain production. The state's investment in water conservancy for farmers in Guangdong Province reached 31.81 million yuan, and various agricultural loans of more than 180 million yuan were issued; about 8 million dan of cake fertilizer and chemical fertilizer, and more than 11 million dan of other fertilizers were supplied, and more than 430,000 dan of "666" insecticide were supplied. At the same time, relevant departments also took a series of measures to support production in disaster-stricken areas. This support played a great role in improving rural productivity and alleviating farmers' production and life difficulties.

It should be pointed out that Guangdong Province's grain production increase in 1956 has not yet completed the original plan, which is more than 300 million jin short of the state's target of 2.49 billion jin, and about 800 million jin short of the provincial party committee's requirement of 2.9 billion jin increase. The reasons for not being able to complete the plan, in addition to the fact that the increased production plan formulated in 1956 was somewhat too high, were mainly that some areas violated the guiding principle of adapting to local conditions in reforming farming systems and promoting advanced technologies. These areas either did not increase production, or decreased production, or even suffered crop failure.

The experience of the past year proves that both advanced and backward farming systems or farming technologies have certain conditions for their existence. It is wrong to think that as long as the backward ones are replaced by the advanced ones, achievements can be made. In particular, the reform of the farming system is closely related to land, climate, water conservancy, fertilizer, the farming habits and experience of the masses, and labor conditions. In some areas of western Guangdong, farmers sow seeds in the ground and let them grow naturally. This farming system must be gradually changed. However, these areas generally lack water conservancy conditions, the land is barren, and there is a lack of fertilizer. In 1956, Nantian Agricultural Cooperative in Haikang County blindly converted more than 600 mu of broadcasting fields to dibbling. Because the water conservancy conditions were not improved and there was a lack of water, the crops could not grow and had to plow down 380 mu. In 1956, the northern Guangdong region carried out large-scale work of changing one crop to two crops. Some areas achieved significant increases in production after the change, while others, due to neglecting the characteristics of this one-crop-a-year region (the mountainous area has relatively low temperatures, a relatively long frost period, relatively short sunshine hours, and insufficient labor), the result of the forced change was that two crops were not as productive as one crop. Renhua County converted 40,000 mu of single-crop paddy fields to double-crop fields. Because of insufficient labor, the labor could not be allocated during the summer planting, resulting in the abandonment of 30,000 mu. Some areas also blindly promoted the experience of changing hoeing seedlings to pulling seedlings, changing water sowing to dry sowing, early sowing and early planting, single-plant close planting, and promoting improved rice varieties, which not only did not increase farmers' income, but turned good things into bad things. According to rough statistics, there are more than one million mu of rice fields throughout the province with similar inappropriate reforms.

This phenomenon of implementing technical reforms in violation of the principle of adapting to local conditions reflects the subjectivism and bureaucratism of the agricultural leadership departments. Guangdong Province is a province with complex natural conditions and extremely uneven population distribution. In 1956, all places where agricultural production was relatively good and increased production was relatively high were the result of specifically leading agricultural production according to the characteristics of different regions. For example, in Chao'an County, which has maintained the title of thousand-jin rice county for two years, 14 of the 29 county committee members of the Party were often stationed in key districts and key townships, specifically leading the production of one district and one township. They promoted advanced technologies, adopted pilot demonstrations, organized mass observation and comparison, and used examples to persuade farmers. However, the leaders in other areas lacked investigation and research on the situation in their own areas, mechanically applied the experiences of other areas, did not consult with the masses, and even adopted the simple method of assigning tasks from top to bottom and completing them within a limited time, with the result that they not only did not grasp the key to increased production in their own areas, but often caused coercion and commandism among grassroots cadres. For example, a Party committee member in Leidong County, in order to complete the task of reforming broadcasting fields assigned by the higher authorities, had to threaten the masses, saying: "Whoever does not change is a counter-revolutionary." This not only aroused the dissatisfaction of the masses, but also caused losses in production.

Guangdong Province has many successful experiences and lessons learned in leading agricultural production. If it can be well summarized, it will be of great significance to further improving the province's grain production level.

    广东粮食生产战线上的巨大胜利
    李少球　吴尔祥
    广东省1956年在粮食生产战线上又取得了一次巨大的胜利。全省粮食总产量预计可以达到二百四十亿斤（不包括黄豆），比1955年增加二十一亿斤左右。这是广东省历史上粮食增产最多的一年。
    1956年广东省粮食单位面积产量平均比1955年提高了5.5％左右。有不少地区去年都创造了单位面积产量的新纪录。在潮汕平原，虽然曾遭受旱患和受肥料供应不及时的影响；但是，潮安、澄海、潮阳等三个县仍然保持了前年得到的“粮食千斤县”的光荣称号，普宁和揭阳两个县，平均每亩粮食产量也达到了一千斤。一向耕作技术落后、单位产量很低的海南、合浦和雷州半岛等地区，1956年也出现了数百个粮食千斤丰产社。海南屯昌县东岭农业社、澄迈县钟寨农业社、临高县多文农业社和汕头市郊区的鮀南乡红光、红旗两个农业社，都创造了双季稻单位面积产量的新纪录，打破了揭阳县云光农业社1955年创造的双季稻每亩收获二千零一十二点六斤的全国最高纪录。这说明广东省在高产地区还有进一步提高单位面积产量的可能，在低产地区增产潜力更大。
    广东省具有特别优越的自然条件，但同时又是多灾多害的一个省份。1956年广东省在实现农业合作化的基础上，发挥了各方面有利条件，克服了各种自然灾害，因而争得了粮食增产的巨大胜利。
    增加复种面积，是广东省获得粮食增产的一条重要措施。广东大部分土地都可以做到一年三熟。增加复种面积，主要是扩大冬种面积和把一年只收一季的改为收两季。1955年冬天，全省种下了一千七百五十万亩的冬种作物，比1954年冬种面积增加了三百五十万亩。由于加强了冬种作物的田间管理，小麦、杂粮等都获得了良好的收成。春收的粮食比1955年增加了七亿多斤，占1956年全省粮食总增产数的三分之一。1956年全省把一年只收一次的稻田改成一年两熟的有二百一十八万亩。两熟田播种面积比1955年增加了一倍，并且大部分都获得了增产。
    广东潮汕地区农民的耕作经验是闻名于全国的，但是在广东的其他许多地区还保留着原始的耕作制度，耕作方法极为粗放，因此产量极不平衡，高产的每亩达一千斤甚至二千斤以上，低产的每亩只有一百来斤，甚至只有几十斤。1956年广东省在合作化的基础上，积极地总结推广以潮汕高产地区为中心的先进耕作经验，改革落后的耕作制度和耕作方法。2月间，广东省召开了第一届农业劳动模范会议，集中地系统地总结和交流了各方面的增产经验；同时举办了全省农业生产展览会，介绍广东省历年来在农业生产战线上的成就和主要经验。接着又利用展品做教材，举办了十一期农民训练班，训练了三万多人的农业技术改革队伍。全省建立了一千三百多个农业技术推广站。通过各地的技术推广站，全省还训练了农民技术员约有一百万人次。这些措施，使各种先进的耕作经验获得了广泛的传授。因此，1956年不论在改革耕作制度方面或推广先进技术方面，所取得的成绩都远超过过去任何一年。如水稻间作改连作，撒种改条播或插秧，混种改分种，实行小科密植等等。此外，推广优良稻种面积比1955年扩大了一倍多。从一年来的增产效果来看，实行这些措施基本上都是成功的。1956年间作改成连作的一百七十万亩水稻，估计可以增产稻谷二亿斤。把撒种田改成条播或插秧的有的比原来产量增产了一倍以上。
    1956年广东省农民所积的土杂肥，包括河泥、塘泥、海泥、野生绿肥等，总数达四十二亿多担，比1955年增加了三倍多，但这些土杂肥主要是集中使用在早造，晚造因商品肥供应不及时，造成部分地区发生晚造肥料不足的现象。
    中共广东省委提出的在七年内基本消灭旱灾的号召，获得了全省农民的热烈拥护。全省在三个多月中，靠打井、挖塘、建水库等办法，新增加的灌溉面积就有三百多万亩，超过原计划的两倍；原计划改善灌溉的面积二百六十万亩，结果完成了六百多万亩。海康县乌石区去年因为挖了三千六百多眼田头井，使四千多亩旱田解除了旱患，全区八十六个农业社，有八十个获得丰收。
    广东省在防治病虫害方面取得的成绩也是很大的。主要经验在于摸准了为害水稻最大的三化螟虫的发生规律。消灭越冬的螟虫，使它丧失窝藏之所。据统计，全省采取挖稻根、放水浸田等办法，消灭越冬螟虫面积有二千七百八十多万亩，比1955年增加六倍多。去年早稻采用早熟品种，适当提前插植，晚稻又在第三代螟蛾盛发以后才插秧，避过了螟虫为害严重的季节。加上发动群众开展了人工捕杀和药剂喷射等综合性的除虫运动，结果水稻的螟害率由去年的6％下降到2％以下。1956年国家在经济上对农民的多方支援，也是使广东省获得粮食增产的一个重要因素。国家对广东省农民兴修水利的投资数达到三千一百八十一万元，发放各种农业贷款一亿八千多万元；供应饼肥、化学肥料约八百万担，其他肥料一千一百多万担，供应“六六六”杀虫药剂四十三万多担。同时，有关部门还对受灾的地区采取了一系列扶助生产的措施。这些支援对提高农村生产力，解除农民生产和生活上的困难起到了很大的作用。
    应该指出，1956年广东省的粮食增产还没有完成原定计划，比国家下达的增产指标二十四亿九千万斤还差三亿多斤，比省委的要求增产二十九亿斤则差八亿斤左右。不能完成计划的原因，除了1956年制定的增产计划有些偏高以外，主要是某些地区在改革耕作制度和推广先进技术中，违反了因地制宜的指导原则。这些地区或是没有增产，或是反而减产，有的甚至失收。
    一年来的经验证明，不论是先进或落后的耕作制度或耕作技术，都有它一定的存在的条件，以为凡是落后的只要用先进的去代替，就可以取得成绩，那是错误的。特别是耕作制度的改革，它和土地、气候、水利、肥料、群众耕作习惯和经验、以及劳动力等条件都有密切的关系。粤西有些地区农民把种子撒在地里，让它自生自长，这种耕作制度是必须逐步加以改变的。但是这类地区一般都缺乏水利条件，土地瘦瘠，肥料缺乏。海康县南田农业社1956年盲目地把六百多亩撒种田改成点播，因为水利条件没有改善，缺水，长不起来，不得不犁掉三百八十亩。粤北地区1956年大规模地进行一熟改成两熟的工作，有的改种后获得了显著的增产，有的由于忽视了这种一年一熟地区的特点（山区温度比较低，霜期比较长，日照时间比较短，劳动力不足等），勉强改的结果，两造反而不如一造收成多。仁化县把一年一熟的稻田改成一年两熟的有四万亩，因为劳动力不足，夏种时劳动力调配不过来，结果丢荒了三万亩。还有些地区盲目推广铲秧改拔秧，水播改旱播，早播早植、单株密植和推广优良稻种等经验，不仅没有为农民增加收入，反而把好事办成坏事。据粗略统计，类似这些不恰当的改革的稻田，全省约有一百多万亩。
    这种违反因地制宜的原则实行技术改革的现象，反映了农业领导部门的主观主义和官僚主义。广东省是一个自然条件复杂，人口分布极不平均的省份。1956年凡是农业生产搞得比较好，增产比较多的地方，都是根据不同地区的特点具体地领导农业生产的结果。比如已经保持两年的稻谷千斤县的潮安县，在党的二十九个县委委员中，经常有十四个驻在各重点区、重点乡，具体领导一区一乡的生产。他们推广先进技术，采取了试点示范、组织群众性的观摩评比，用实例来说服农民的办法。但是另外有些地区的领导，对本地区的情况缺乏调查研究，生搬硬套外区的经验，不和群众商量，甚至采取单纯的从上而下的分配任务限期完成的办法，结果不但没有抓住本地区的增产关键，而且往往造成了基层干部的强迫命令。比如雷东县有一个党的区委委员，为了完成上级分配的改革撒种田的任务，只好威胁群众说：“谁不改谁就是反革命。”这不仅引起群众的不满，而且造成生产上的损失。
    广东省在领导农业生产工作中，有许多成功的经验，也有失败的教训。如果能够很好地加以总结，对进一步提高全省的粮食生产水平是有很大的意义的。
