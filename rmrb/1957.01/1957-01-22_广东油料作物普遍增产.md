Guangdong's Oil Crops Generally Increased Production

(Our report) Last year, Guangdong Province's more than 4.4 million mu of oil crops generally achieved increased production, with a total output approximately 790,000 dan more than in 1955. Among them, peanuts, which account for the largest planting area of oil crops, increased production by about 20%, rapeseed increased by more than 50%, and sesame increased by more than 15%. In the Shalang River basin, which is rich in peanuts, most areas had a good peanut harvest, with Maoming County alone increasing production by 40%. The Dafang Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Haikang County had 4.6 mu of peanuts, averaging 765 jin of dry peanuts per mu, breaking the 1955 Guangdong Province's top peanut high-yield model, the 690 jin per mu record of the Poxin Agricultural Cooperative in Dianbai County.
