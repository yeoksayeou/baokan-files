    Opinions on Two Contentious Issues in the Study of the History of Philosophy

    I. The Struggle Between Materialism and Idealism in the History of Philosophy
    For a period of time, we had a debate about whether there was a struggle between materialism and idealism in the history of Chinese philosophy. Some comrades once had the idea of denying the existence of a struggle between materialism and idealism in the history of Chinese philosophy. They emphasized the uniqueness of the history of Chinese philosophy, arguing that while there was a struggle between these two schools of thought in Western philosophy, this was not necessarily the case in the history of Chinese philosophy. They believed that applying the label of the struggle between materialism and idealism from Western philosophy to the history of Chinese philosophy was not necessarily appropriate. It is true that the history of Chinese philosophy has not been systematically and scientifically organized like the history of Western philosophy, and it is sometimes unclear which philosophers are materialists and which are idealists. Despite the many difficulties that may be encountered in defining the boundaries between materialism and idealism, we cannot deny the existence of the struggle between materialism and idealism in principle, otherwise, we will inevitably commit a principled error. This shows that he does not understand Engels' formulation of the fundamental question of philosophy. This is a bit like some people who believe that it is difficult to clearly divide classes in Chinese society, and therefore deny class struggle. They believe that the division of classes is very forced, and that dividing social development into several fixed stages is also an abstract and rigid format. However, as far as we are concerned, to study the struggle between idealism and materialism in the history of Chinese philosophy is not to abstractly and dogmatically force the formula of Western philosophy into the history of Chinese philosophy, but to require a concrete understanding of the difference between materialism and idealism, to grasp the central issues in the history of philosophy, and to specifically distinguish the attitudes of various philosophers towards the fundamental question of thinking and existence, the subjective and the objective.
    Zhdanov defined the history of philosophy as the history of the struggle between materialism and idealism, and regarded the history of philosophy as the history of the emergence and development of materialism. This should be recognized as a great and correct insight. This is the fundamental principle we must grasp in studying the history of philosophy. Therefore, the question is not whether the history of philosophy is the history of the struggle between materialism and idealism, but what kind of understanding we have of the struggle between materialism and idealism. In the past, our understanding of the struggle between materialism and idealism may have been too narrow, too formal, and too one-sided.
    First of all, although the history of philosophy is the history of the struggle between materialism and idealism, the struggle between materialism and idealism is very different from the struggle in religion and the struggle in politics (although the two are closely related). Because political struggles often take the form of war, and religious struggles also often take the form of war, such as the so-called religious wars in history. In other words, political struggles and religious struggles may take violent forms of killing and persecution, while the philosophical struggle between materialism and idealism does not take the form of war and killing, and it can be said that "gentlemen use their mouths, not their hands." I admit that the philosophical front is closely related and coordinated with the political, economic, and military fronts, but it should be noted that the philosophical front is far in the rear, far beyond the range of artillery fire, and is not the target of aircraft bombing.
    Secondly, the relationship and debate between materialists and idealists are not simply a relationship between revolution and counter-revolution. They can sometimes even be said to be a relationship of teachers and students, friends, or even a struggle between the present self and the past self. Yesterday's me may have been an idealist, today's me may be a materialist, and today's me and yesterday's me can engage in ideological struggle, even extremely sharp ideological struggle. A person may have indulged in fantasy and leaned towards the subjective in his early years, and was an idealist, but in his later years, he was practical and grasped reality, becoming a materialist; or he may have lived among the people and close to life in his early years, and was a materialist, but in his later years, he lived in luxury and was divorced from reality, becoming an idealist in a bad sense; a philosopher may be a materialist on one issue, but an idealist on another issue, which is not only theoretically possible, but in fact many examples can be cited in the history of philosophy. It is even more common in the history of philosophy for materialists and idealists to have a teacher-student relationship. For example, Feuerbach and Marx were both materialists, and they can both be said to be students of Hegel. Democritus was a materialist, and he was influenced by the idealism of the Eleatic school. Epicurus was a materialist, and he inherited Socrates' emphasis on moral cultivation. And when the Western philosophical community regarded Hegel as a "dead dog," Marx especially emphasized that he was a student of Hegel, which is especially noteworthy. Dai Dongyuan once said: "A second-rate hand can teach a first-rate hand, but a first-rate hand may not be able to teach a first-rate hand." If we assume that the second-rate hand is an idealist and the first-rate hand is a materialist, it is enough to show that the relationship between materialists and idealists is sometimes "a student surpassing his teacher," not a red-and-white relationship.
    Zhang Hengqu was a materialist, and Cheng Mingdao and Cheng Yichuan were idealists, but Zhang Hengqu and the Cheng brothers were relatives and friends. Hume worked as a diplomat in Paris and had a very good friendship with French materialists. Since the struggle between materialists and idealists is a relationship between teachers and students, friends, and the past self and the future self, does this struggle still reflect class struggle? As far as the origins of each philosopher are concerned, they may all have come from the same class, but as far as the role and consequences of their ideas in society are concerned, it may reflect different class interests. That is to say, when the new self and the old self, the present self and the past self struggle, it may contain a sharp class struggle. The struggle between friends, teachers and students, and schools of thought may also reflect the interests of different classes. I have repeatedly pointed out that idealists and materialists are sometimes in a teacher-student and friend relationship, but this cannot lead to the conclusion that materialism and idealism can coexist peacefully in thought and philosophy. My intention is only to show that the struggle between the two generally takes the form of free debate and mutual learning between teachers and students and friends. I remember that Zhu Xi said when he argued with Lu Xiangshan: If the host and guest disagree academically and are engaged in a heated debate in the hall, and the servant, out of loyalty to the host, angrily walks to the hall, slaps the guest a few times, and drives the guest out of the door. Zhu Xi said that this ignorant servant would definitely be scolded and reprimanded by the host. Zhu Xi's words have profound meaning. If we attempt to use administrative orders and crude methods to resolve the philosophical struggle between idealism and materialism, it will inevitably be a bit like the servant scolded by Zhu Xi. We emphasize the difference between the struggle between materialism and idealism and political struggle, but we do not advocate relaxing the Party's political leadership over academic thought (because political leadership is essentially ideological leadership, the leadership of Marxism-Leninism), and we do not advocate relaxing the struggle of materialism against idealism. I am afraid that only those who believe that the struggle on the academic ideological front can be solved by administrative orders, by slapping faces and spanking, will relax their attention to and leadership of academic thought, and will think that the victory of materialism can be guaranteed by relying solely on political power, military power, and financial power, and that there is no need to conduct in-depth and systematic theoretical and academic struggles against idealism.
    Again, idealism and materialism are not two fixed camps. The left-wing camp is full of materialism, and materialism is linked to materialism; the right-wing camp is full of idealism, and idealism is linked to idealism, with an insurmountable gap in the middle. I can say with certainty that there is no 100% materialism in the history of philosophy, nor is there 100% idealism. Therefore, materialism and idealism have a side of mutual struggle, but also a side of mutual absorption, utilization, and reliance. We say that society is always a struggle between the new and the old. But new things also have a side of absorbing, utilizing, and relying on old things. In other words, I admit that the history of philosophy is the history of the struggle between materialism and idealism, but their struggle process is not a parallel struggle between two camps, one side being materialism and the other side being idealism, but often a tortuous process of waxing and waning, a contradictory development process. The struggle between materialism and idealism in the history of philosophy is not that materialism always wins. Materialism is also replaced by later and more developed idealism, and idealism is also replaced by later and more developed materialism. Of course, I also believe that philosophy has developed into dialectical materialism—the highest, most developed, most scientific, and richest materialism. It inherits the excellent traditions of materialism, absorbs the rational core of idealism in history, and will never be defeated by any idealism again. Although the struggle between materialism and idealism still exists in communist society, this struggle can only promote dialectical materialism to be richer and more developed.
    It is also not uncommon in the history of philosophy that in a certain era, we only see the internal quarrels between idealists, and we do not hear the voices of materialists. But this does not mean that there is no struggle between materialism and idealism, let alone that the struggle between the two sides can be cancelled. We must keep in mind Lenin's teaching: When an idealist criticizes another idealist, it is often beneficial to materialism. It is the duty of historians of philosophy to point out these places that are conducive to materialism. This makes a certain aspect or certain factors participating in the internal quarrels of idealism become tools or necessary links to promote the development of materialism.
    There is also a situation that must be pointed out: In the history of philosophy, it is not the entire idealism that struggles against the entire materialism, or vice versa, the entire materialism that struggles against the entire idealism, and the two entire blocks always struggle with each other. In fact, it is often the later materialism that absorbs the materialist components in the previous idealist system to oppose its idealist components. In other words, the latter often adopts the method of "using your own spear to attack your own shield" to fight the former. For example, Hegel absorbed the epistemological thought and dialectical factors in Kant's transcendental logic to oppose Kant's subjective idealism and agnosticism. Feuerbach absorbed some humanistic factors in Hegel's philosophy to oppose Hegel's idealist system. Marx used the dialectics and some historical materialist sprouts in Hegel's philosophy to oppose Hegel's idealist system. Absorbing the parts that are the same as oneself to oppose the parts that are different from oneself, this can be said to be an extremely dialectical and brilliant strategy often adopted in the process of the struggle between materialism and idealism (in fact, it is not a strategy, but the inevitable process of the contradictory development of the history of philosophy).
    Finally, I would like to use Hegel's method of writing the history of philosophy to illustrate the process of the struggle between materialism and idealism. Hegel obviously regarded the history of philosophy as the history of the emergence and development of idealism. Hegel believed that the history of philosophy, when it came to his own objective idealist system, seemed to be the convergence of all rivers into the sea, a great achievement, and developed to the highest peak. All the various previous materialist and idealist systems were only preparing conditions for his own objective idealist system, and were absorbed as various links in his own system. Hegel obviously waged a resolute struggle against materialism in his history of philosophy. Through the idealist viewpoint of writing the history of philosophy, he criticized materialism and absorbed the excellent contents of materialism into idealism. He interpreted philosophers who wavered between materialism and idealism as philosophers who were close to idealism. We can say that Hegel wrote the history of philosophy as the history of the development of idealism through the methods of criticism, interpretation, absorption, and sublimation, and waged a resolute struggle against materialism. Of course, Hegel made an idealist distortion of the history of philosophy. We should write the history of philosophy based on dialectical materialism and historical materialism, "treat people in the way they treat you", adopt a historical attitude to criticize idealism in a practical and realistic way, and objectively expound the accurate development clues of materialism, showing that in the entire process of the development of the history of philosophy, idealism was indeed sublimated, and materialism was indeed gradually developing and improving.
    II. The Issue of Inheritance of Philosophical Heritage
    Based on what is said above, we recognize that the history of philosophy is not simply materialism inheriting materialism, and idealism inheriting idealism. Later materialism often inherits the rational core of idealism, and similarly, later idealism often absorbs some materialist principles.
    Of course, idealists often think that they have a line of "orthodox tradition" inherited from each other, like the "orthodox tradition" from Yao and Shun to Confucius and Mencius mentioned by Han Yu. On the other hand, materialists often believe that they have a line of "orthodox tradition" inherited from each other and have no common ground with idealism. This theory of orthodox tradition emphasizes a one-sided teacher-inheritance relationship, which is not completely wrong, because each school does have a side of self-contained system with strict barriers. But it is always dogmatic and conservative thinking, and it is always unavoidable to have sectarian views and factional disputes; this is not looking at historical issues from a comprehensive and dialectical development perspective. For example, the Confucian scholars of the Song and Ming Dynasties in China absorbed and inherited some of the ideas of Buddhism and Taoism, but they themselves refused to admit it. We who talk about historicism are not afraid to admit that we have absorbed some of the rational core of idealism. The founders of Marxism-Leninism openly admitted that they were students of some classical idealists, and openly admitted that German classical philosophy was one of the three sources of Marxism. We no longer metaphysically deny the process of historical contradictory development and consider it shameful to absorb some rational core in idealism. Materialists openly admit that they were once students of idealists, which does not mean that idealism is superior to materialism. On the contrary, this precisely shows that materialists are humble, start from the objective, learn from the other party with an open mind, do not obliterate the rational components of the other party, and treat the history of philosophy in a realistic way. This kind of humble materialism can always progress and cannot be defeated.
    The main issue concerning the inheritance of philosophical heritage is to explain why classical philosophical thoughts produced in feudal society and capitalist society can still play a good role in socialist society and be conducive to socialist construction. In other words, why can philosophical thoughts that once served feudal landlords and the bourgeoisie to a greater or lesser extent now or in the future serve the working class? Marx also raised such a question. When he talked about the social background of Greek literature and art, he said: "The difficulty does not lie in understanding that Greek art and epic are related to certain social development forms. The difficulty is how they can still give us artistic satisfaction, and in some respects, still be regarded as norms and unattainable models" ("Critique of Political Economy", p. 173, People's Publishing House). In other words, why can philosophy (or art), which has a certain class basis and is a product of a certain society and era, have its universality and serve other eras, other societies, and other classes? This is a very difficult question to answer. If the answer is not good, it is easy to fall into the quagmire of metaphysics or idealism. In the spirit of free debate, I personally would like to try to put forward the following answers to this question.
    1. The philosophical systems in the history of philosophy often have typicality. It is a special product of a certain time, a certain place, a certain nation, and a certain society, and at the same time it has the typicality of general significance. The so-called typicality is the combination of particularity (era, individual, class) and universality. There are many erroneous ideas in philosophy. Although they are one-sided and wrong, this error is also a product of social history. It can almost be said that it is an inevitable and representative error, an error that everyone can hardly avoid. These representative and inevitable errors committed by philosophers in history can be said that they represent mankind, or ordinary people, in committing errors. Their mistakes are a useful lesson for us. Constantly criticizing and correcting these typical erroneous ideas can prevent us from repeating or making fewer of these errors. What I mean is that philosophical thoughts in the history of philosophy, even if they are one-sided, wrong, and idealistic, as long as they are qualified to be recorded in the history of philosophy, they are a contribution to human culture, and they have the value of being preserved, studied, and criticized. As for philosophical truths that have typical significance, they are like great works of art that have typical significance. They have their reality and their people, and they are always worth learning, and worth re-experiencing and interpreting.
    2. Philosophical systems in the history of philosophy are often the crystallization of culture, the highest expression of the spirit of the times, and the highest summary of the life experience, wisdom, and thoughts of that era's nation and class. They are the combination of the finite and the infinite, the combination of the eternal and the present, because grasping the present is grasping the eternal. In addition to embodying personal personality, the spirit of the times, national spirit, and class character, truth also has its universality and eternity. The class has fallen, but some philosophies that brilliantly express the wisdom of that class may not fall; the nation has declined, but excellent philosophies that represent the culture of that nation may not decline; the Grand View Garden has fallen, but "Dream of the Red Chamber" can be immortal. Philosophy, like literature and art, has the function of saving things that change with time, class, and personnel changes, and making them immortal.
    3. Philosophy itself, as a discipline that grasps the truth, is itself the wealth of the country and the people. Academic truth, on the one hand, can serve a specific class and be used by it, and on the other hand, it has its own value. However, corrupt and decadent dynasties and dying classes always fail to distinguish right from wrong, and even the philosophical thoughts that are extremely beneficial to them, they often not only cannot use, but also persecute them, which is a very common fact. Many great philosophical thoughts may be inherited by other countries and nations if they cannot be well inherited in their own country. For example, Indian Buddhism and Greek philosophy have declined in their own countries, but have been inherited and carried forward by other nations. Another example is Western classical philosophy. If it had been introduced to China in large quantities during the Xinhai Revolution, it would have helped the development of the bourgeois ideological system and benefited the bourgeois regime at that time. However, due to the weakness of the Chinese bourgeoisie and the lack of a cultural foundation for the Xinhai Revolution, Western philosophical thoughts were not introduced to China early. Today, in order to build a socialist culture, we are trying to translate and introduce Western classical philosophy on a large scale, so it will help the political power and cultural development of the working class and make it have a deeper and richer theoretical and academic foundation.
    Science and materialism, which have played a progressive role, are of course the wealth of the country and the people. Even things that have been distorted and used by reactionary ruling classes in certain historical stages and have hindered social progress, such as religion and idealism, as long as there is a trace of rationality in them, are also the wealth of the country and the nation and cannot be allowed to disappear on their own. For example, although Yang Zhu and Mo Di were scolded by Mencius as "having no father or monarch", and although Buddhism and Taoism were "rejected" by Han Yu, who declared that he would "humanize their people and burn their books", but our history of philosophy has the thoughts of Yang Zhu, Mo Di, Buddhism, and Taoism, and has the idealist philosophy of Cheng Zhu and Lu Wang. Compared with those nations that lack a rich national culture and philosophical heritage, we cannot but thank our ancestors for leaving us with a richer philosophical heritage that we can explore, utilize, criticize, and absorb. However, admitting that Yang Zhu, Mo Di, Buddhism, Taoism, Cheng Zhu, and Lu Wang have enriched our philosophical heritage does not mean that we do not critically absorb and evaluate their philosophical thoughts based on new perspectives and new methods. The higher our level of Marxism-Leninism, the better our mastery of materialist dialectics, and the more developed our new socialist culture, the more we will be able to explore and utilize the positive factors of all things, so that "every bamboo head and wood chip is useful" and that "cow urine and horse manure, broken drum skin" can be "all collected and stored".
    In the final analysis, it depends on who holds the political power. If it is in the hands of the reactionary class, academic culture will be destroyed everywhere, and it will never be able to strive for the great classical philosophical thoughts to serve it. However, in the hands of the progressive and democratic people, classical philosophy can be carried forward and play a new progressive role. Because the so-called inheriting the philosophical heritage is not to restore the old, nor is it simply to move the things of the ancients or foreigners to China today without modification. Rather, it is to inherit it from the perspective of historical materialism, and to inherit it for the new needs of the people and for the construction of socialism. The so-called inheritance includes processing and transforming it for the needs of the revolution. From the perspective of dialectics, inheritance should include the process of negation, preservation, and improvement.
    In the semi-colonial and semi-feudal old society, many excellent cultural heritages were regarded as dung and not cherished. Even foreign academic culture, when moved to the old society in China, was often not correctly absorbed and failed to play its progressive role. Instead, it was used by reactionary rulers and caused harmful consequences.
    After liberation, with Marxism-Leninism as a guide, and in order to meet the needs of socialist construction, many things that were neglected and despised in the old society, such as traditional Chinese medicine, old dramas, acrobatics, etc., have been given due attention and improved, inherited and carried forward, and played a great progressive role.
    I believe that with the weapon of Marxism-Leninism and the guidance of the great and correct policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend", both the excellent heritage in the history of Chinese philosophy and Western classical philosophy can be inherited, carried forward, and improved by the Chinese people, and will surely play a great role and radiate infinite light.

    对于哲学史研究中两个争论问题的意见
    贺麟
    一、哲学史上的唯物主义与唯心主义斗争
    在有一段期间，我们曾经发生过中国哲学史里面有没有唯物主义与唯心主义斗争的问题。有些同志曾经有过否认中国哲学史上有唯物主义与唯心主义斗争的想法。他们强调中国哲学史的特殊性，他们认为尽管西方哲学史上有这两派学说的斗争，但在中国哲学史上却未必有。他们认为唯物主义与唯心主义的斗争这种西方哲学史上的帽子拿来套在中国哲学史上未必适宜。诚然中国哲学史还不像西方哲学史那样经过系统的科学的整理，哪些哲学家是唯物主义者或哪些哲学家是唯心主义者有时还搞不清楚。尽管在划分唯物主义同唯心主义的界限的时候可能碰到很多困难，但是原则上我们不能否认有唯物主义与唯心主义的斗争，不然，难免不犯原则性的错误。这表示他不懂得恩格斯关于哲学上的根本问题的提法。这就有点像有些人认为中国社会很难划分明确的阶级，因而否认阶级斗争一样。他们认为阶级的划分是很勉强的，把社会发展划分为若干确定的阶段也是抽象生硬的格式。不过就我们看来，在中国哲学史中去研究唯心主义与唯物主义的斗争，并不是抽象地、教条式地把西方哲学史的套子勉强套进中国哲学史，而是要求具体了解唯物主义与唯心主义的区别，抓住哲学史上的中心问题，具体分辨出各个哲学家对思维与存在、主观与客观这个根本问题的态度。
    日丹诺夫把哲学史定义为唯物主义与唯心主义斗争的历史，把哲学史看成唯物主义发生发展的历史，这应该被认作是一个伟大而正确的见解。这是我们研究哲学史必须掌握的根本原则。所以，问题不在于哲学史是否是唯物主义与唯心主义斗争的历史，问题在于对于唯物主义与唯心主义的斗争作什么样的了解。过去我们可能对于唯物主义与唯心主义的斗争了解得太狭隘、太形式、太片面了一些。
    首先，哲学史虽然是唯物主义与唯心主义斗争的历史，但是唯物主义与唯心主义的斗争和宗教上的斗争、政治上的斗争（两者虽有密切的联系）却有很大的区别。因为，政治上的斗争每每通过战争，宗教上的斗争也常采取战争的形式，譬如：历史上有所谓宗教战争。换言之，政治上的斗争和宗教上的斗争都可能采取杀人迫害的暴力形式，而哲学上的唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争没有通过战争杀人的方式，也可以说“君子动口不动手”。我承认哲学战线与政治战线、经济战线、军事战线都有密切的联系与配合，但须知哲学战线却远处在后方，远处在大炮射程之外，也不是飞机轰炸的目标。
    其次唯物主义者和唯心主义者的关系和争论，也不就是革命与反革命的关系。他们有时甚至可以说是师生、朋友的关系，也可以说是今日之我与昨日之我的斗争。昨天的我可能是唯心主义者，今天的我可能是唯物主义者，今天的我和昨天的我可以作思想斗争，甚至作极其尖锐的思想斗争。一个人可能早年沉溺于幻想，偏于主观，是一个唯心主义者，晚年实事求是，掌握现实，成为唯物主义者；或早年居于民间，接近生活，是一个唯物主义者，而晚年养尊处优，脱离实际，成为一个坏意义的唯心主义者；一个哲学家在这一问题上是唯物主义者，而在另一问题上是唯心主义者，这不唯在理论上很可能，而事实上在哲学史中是可以举出许多实例的。哲学史上唯物主义者和唯心主义者是师生关系更是常有的事，譬如费尔巴哈和马克思都是唯物主义者，他们都可以说是黑格尔的学生。德莫克里特是个唯物主义者，他受过伊利亚派唯心主义的影响。伊壁鸠鲁是个唯物主义者，他承继了苏格拉底注重道德修养的精神。而马克思当西方哲学界把黑格尔当成“死狗”的时候，他特别强调自己是黑格尔的学生，这尤其值得注意。戴东原曾经说过：“二把手教得出大把手，而大把手可未必教得出大把手”。我们试假定二把手是唯心主义者，大把手是唯物主义者，也足以见得唯物主义者与唯心主义者有时是“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”的关系，不是红与白的关系。
    张横渠是唯物主义者，程明道、程伊川是唯心主义者，而张横渠和二程是亲戚和朋友的关系。休谟在巴黎作过外交官，和法国唯物主义者的友谊相当好。既然唯物主义者与唯心主义者的斗争是师生朋友的关系、前我后我的关系，那吗，这种斗争是否还反映阶级斗争呢？就各个哲学家的出身而论，可能都是同出身于一个阶级，就他们的思想在社会上所起的作用和后果而论，它可能反映不同的阶级利益。这也就是说当新我与旧我，今日之我与昨日之我斗争的时候，可能包含有尖锐的阶级斗争，昨日唯心主义的我可能是为反动统治服务的，今日唯物主义的我可能是反映人民利益的。朋友师生间学派思想的斗争也可能反映不同阶级的利益。我一再指出唯心主义者与唯物主义者有时是师生朋友的关系，但不能因此就得出结论说唯物主义与唯心主义在思想上、哲理上可以和平共处。我的意思不过想要表明两者的斗争一般常采取师生朋友间自由争论、互相切磋的方式罢了。记得朱熹与陆象山争辩时曾说过：假如主人与客人学术上意见不合，正在堂上作激烈的辩论，而仆人为了忠于主人，气愤愤地走到堂前，给客人几个耳光，把客人赶出大门。朱熹说这个不懂事的仆人，一定会受到主人的叱责申斥。朱熹这番话有着深刻的意义。假如企图用行政命令、用粗暴的手段来解决哲学上唯心主义与唯物主义的斗争，那就不免有点像被朱子所申斥的仆人。我们强调唯物主义与唯心主义的斗争和政治斗争的区别，却并不主张放松党对学术思想方面的政治领导（因为政治领导实质上是思想领导，马克思列宁主义思想的领导），更不主张放松唯物主义对唯心主义的斗争。恐怕只有相信用行政命令的方式，用打耳光，打屁股的方式可以解决学术思想战线的斗争问题的人，才会放松对学术思想的重视与领导，才会以为单靠政权和军权、财权即可保证唯物主义的胜利，用不着对唯心主义作深入系统的理论上和学术上的斗争。
    再次，唯心主义和唯物主义并不是两个固定的阵营，左边的阵营全是唯物主义，唯物主义与唯物主义一线相承；右边的阵营全是唯心主义，唯心主义与唯心主义一线相承，中间有不可逾越的鸿沟。我可以肯定地说，哲学史上没有百分之百的唯物主义，也没有百分之百的唯心主义。因此，唯物主义与唯心主义有互相斗争的一面，也有互相吸收利用凭借的一面。我们说社会永远是新的东西与旧的东西的斗争。但是新生的事物也有吸收利用凭借着旧的东西的一面。换言之，我承认哲学史是唯物主义与唯心主义斗争的历史，但是他们的斗争过程不是一面是唯物主义一面是唯心主义的那样平行的两个阵营斗争的过程，乃常常是一个曲折的一消一长、一盛一衰的矛盾发展过程。哲学史上唯物主义与唯心主义的斗争并不是唯物主义永远打胜仗。唯物主义也有被较晚、较发展的唯心主义代替的时候，唯心主义也有被较晚、较发展的唯物主义代替的时候。当然，我也相信哲学史发展到辩证唯物主义——最高、最发展、最科学、最丰富的唯物主义，它承继了唯物主义的优秀传统，它吸收了历史上唯心主义的合理内核，它将永远不会再被任何唯心主义所战胜，虽然到了共产主义社会，唯物主义与唯心主义的斗争仍然存在，不过这种斗争只可能促进辩证唯物主义更丰富、更发展。
    哲学史上也并不是没有这样的情形：即在某个时代，我们只看见唯心主义者与唯心主义者内部的争吵，而听不见唯物主义者的声音。但这并不意味着没有唯物主义与唯心主义的斗争，更不意味着双方的斗争可以取消。必须谨记列宁的教导：一个唯心主义者批判另一个唯心主义者时，往往是有利于唯物主义的。哲学史家就有义务指出这些有利于唯物主义的地方。这样就使得参加唯心主义内部争吵的某一方面或某些因素成为推进唯物主义发展的工具或必要环节。
    还有一种情形必须指出：在哲学史上并不是整个唯心主义斗争整个唯物主义，或者反过来，整个唯物主义斗争整个唯心主义，两个整块永远互相斗争。事实上常常是后起的唯物主义吸收前面的唯心主义体系中的唯物主义成分来反对它的唯心主义成分。换言之，后者往往采取“以子之矛陷于之盾”的方式来斗争前者。譬如，黑格尔吸收了康德先验逻辑中的认识论思想和辩证法因素来反对康德的主观唯心主义和不可知论。费尔巴哈吸收了黑格尔哲学中某些人本学的因素来反对黑格尔的唯心主义体系。马克思利用黑格尔哲学中的辩证法和某些历史唯物主义萌芽来反对黑格尔的唯心主义体系。吸收对方与自己相同的部分来反对对方与自己相异的部分，这可以说是在唯物主义和唯心主义斗争的过程中所常常采取的极其辩证而高明的策略（其实并不是策略，乃是哲学史矛盾发展的必然过程）。
    最后，我想用黑格尔写哲学史的方法来说明唯物主义与唯心主义斗争的过程。黑格尔显然把哲学史看成唯心主义发生发展的历史。黑格尔认为哲学史到了他自己的客观唯心主义系统好像是百川归海，集了大成，发展到了最高峰。以前所有各式各样的唯物主义和唯心主义体系，都不过是为他自己的客观唯心主义体系准备条件，被吸收成为他自己体系的各个环节。黑格尔在他的哲学史中显然是对唯物主义作了坚决的斗争，通过写哲学史的唯心观点他把唯物主义批判了，把唯物主义的优秀内容吸收到唯心论中去了。他把徘徊在唯物主义和唯心主义之间的哲学家都解释成为接近唯心主义的哲学家。我们可以说，黑格尔通过批判、解释、吸收与扬弃的手法把哲学史写成为唯心主义发展的历史，对唯物主义作了坚决的斗争。当然，黑格尔对哲学史是作了唯心主义歪曲的。我们根据辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义来写哲学史应该“即以其人之道，还治其人之身”，实事求是地采取历史主义的态度对唯心主义予以批判，对唯物主义确凿的发展线索予以客观的阐述，表明在哲学史发展的整个过程中，唯心主义确是被扬弃了，唯物主义确是逐渐愈来愈发展、愈来愈提高了。
    二、哲学遗产的继承问题
    根据上面所说，我们认识到，哲学史不是单纯的唯物主义承继唯物主义，唯心主义承继唯心主义。晚出的唯物主义往往也承继了唯心主义的合理内核，同样，晚出的唯心论往往也吸收了一些唯物主义的原则。
    当然，唯心主义者往往自己认为他们有其一线相承的“道统”，像韩愈所说的由尧舜传至孔孟的“道统”那样。另一方面唯物论者也往往自认他们有一线相承的“道统”与唯心主义无丝毫的共同之点。这种道统论强调片面的师承关系，并不完全错误，因为每一学派的确有其自成体系壁垒森严的一面。但总是教条主义卫道主义的思想，总免不了门户之见、派别之争；这是不从全面、不从辩证发展的观点去看历史问题。譬如中国宋明儒家吸收并且承继了某些佛老的思想，然而他们自己却死不承认。讲历史主义的我们不怕承认我们曾经吸收了某些唯心主义中的合理内核，马克思列宁主义奠基人公开承认是某些古典唯心主义者的学生，公开承认德国古典哲学是马克思主义的三大来源之一。我们已经不再形而上学地否认历史矛盾发展的过程而以吸收唯心主义中某些合理内核为可耻了。唯物主义者公开承认自己曾经是唯心主义者的学生，这并不表示唯心主义优越于唯物主义。反之，这正表示唯物主义者谦虚，从客观出发，虚心向对方学习，不抹煞对方的合理成分，实事求是地对待哲学史。这种谦虚的唯物主义永远可以进步，不可能被战胜。
    关于哲学遗产的承继问题，主要在于说明在封建社会、资本主义社会产生的古典哲学思想，何以在社会主义社会仍然可以起良好的作用，可以有利于社会主义的建设。这个问题也就是说，曾经或多或少地为封建地主、资产阶级服务的哲学思想，现在或今后何以还可以替工人阶级服务。马克思也曾经提出过这样一个问题，当他谈到希腊文艺的社会背景时，他说：“困难还不在于理解希腊的艺术和史诗与一定的社会发展形态有关。困难是，它们何以仍能给我们以艺术的满足，并且就某方面说，还是当作规范和高不可及的模本”（“政治经济学批判”第173页，人民出版社）。这个问题换句话说，也就是有一定阶级基础，是一定的社会和时代的产物的哲学（或艺术），何以有其普遍性，可以为别的时代、别的社会，别的阶级服务。这是一个很难解答的问题，解答得不好，就很容易陷入形而上学或唯心主义的泥坑，本着自由争辩的精神，我个人对于这个问题愿意试图提出下面几个解答。
    一、哲学史里面的哲学体系往往具有典型性。它是某时、某地、某民族、某社会的特殊产物，同时它又具有一般意义的典型性。所谓典型就是特殊性（时代、个人、阶级）与普遍性的结合。哲学上有许多错误的思想，虽然是片面的、错误的，然而这种错误也是社会历史的产物，几乎可以说是有必然性和代表性的错误，是每个人很难避免的错误。哲学家在历史上所犯的这些有代表性和必然性的错误，可以说，他们是代表了人类、或一般的人在那里犯错误。他们的错误，对于我们是一个有益的教训。不断地批判纠正这些典型的错误思想，就可以防止我们重犯或少犯这种错误。我的意思是说，哲学史上的哲学思想，哪怕是片面的、错误的、唯心的，只要它有资格被记载在哲学史里面，它就是对人类文化的一种贡献，它就有被保存、被研究、被批判的价值。至于具有典型意义的哲学真理，那也如同具有典型意义的伟大艺术品一样，有其现实性与人民性，永远值得我们学习，值得我们去重新加以体会和解释。
    二、哲学史上的哲学体系，每每是文化的结晶，是时代精神的最高表现，是那一时代民族和阶级的生活经验、智慧、思想最高的总结。他们是有限与无限的结合，永恒与现在的结合，因为掌握现在，就是掌握永恒。真理除了体现个人的个性、时代精神、民族精神、阶级性之外，还有其普遍性和永恒性。阶级倒了，某些卓越地表现了那个阶级的智慧的哲学可以不倒；民族衰了，代表那个民族文化的优秀的哲学可以不衰；大观园倒了，“红楼梦”可以不朽。哲学与文学艺术一样，具有拯救随时间、阶级、人事变迁而变迁的事物，使之不朽的功用。
    三、哲学本身做为一种掌握真理的学术，他本身就是国家和人民的财富。学术真理，一方面可以为某一特定阶级服务，被其利用，另一方面它有其本身的价值。但是腐朽堕落的王朝和垂死的阶级总是不辨是非黑白，哪怕是对它极其有利的哲学思想，它往往不惟不能利用，反而加以迫害，这是一个极其常见的事实。有许多伟大的哲学思想，如果在它本国不能很好地被承继，也可能被其它国家和民族所承继。譬如印度的佛学，希腊的哲学在本国都曾经衰落，反而为别的民族所承继和发扬。又如西方古典哲学，假如在辛亥革命时期就被大量介绍到中国来，那么它就有助于资产阶级思想体系的发展，有利于当时资产阶级政权，但是由于中国资产阶级的软弱，辛亥革命缺乏文化基础，西方哲学思想没有及早介绍到中国来。我们今天为了建设社会主义文化，才企图大力把西方的古典哲学翻译介绍过来，因而就有助于工人阶级的政权和文化的发展，使其有更深、更丰富的理论学术基础。
    起过进步作用的科学和唯物主义固然是国家和人民的财富，哪怕是过去在某些历史阶段曾经被反动统治阶级歪曲利用，妨害过社会进步的东西，如宗教和唯心主义，只要其中有丝毫合理的东西，也是国家民族的财富，不能任其自行消灭。譬如尽管杨墨被孟子骂为“无父无君”，尽管佛老被韩愈加以“攘斥”，宣称要“人其人、火其书”，但我们的哲学史有了杨墨佛老的思想、有了程朱陆王的唯心主义哲学，比之那些缺乏丰富民族文化和哲学遗产的民族，我们不能不感谢我们的祖先给我们留下比较丰富的哲学遗产可以供我们发掘利用，批判吸收。但是承认杨墨佛老程朱陆王丰富了我们的哲学遗产，并不意味着对他们的哲学思想不根据新观点、新方法予以批判地吸收和估价。我们的马克思列宁主义水平越高，唯物辩证法掌握得越好，我们的新的社会主义的文化越发达，我们就越能发掘并利用一切事物的积极因素，使“竹头木屑皆各有用”使“牛溲马勃、败鼓之皮”皆得到“俱收并蓄”。
    归根到底，要看政权掌握在谁手里。如果在反动阶级的手里，学术文化到处受到摧残，它绝不能争取伟大的古典哲学思想为它服务，但是在进步民主的人民手里，就能使古典哲学发扬光大，起新的进步作用。因为所谓继承哲学遗产，并不是复古，也不是简单地把古人的或外国的东西原封不动地搬到今天中国来。而是用历史唯物主义的观点去承继，为人民的新需要，为社会主义的建设去承继。所谓承继，是包含有为革命的需要而加以加工改造。承继从辩证法讲来，应包含有否定、保存和提高的过程。
    在半殖民地半封建的旧社会，很多优秀的文化遗产被视如粪土而不加以珍惜，就是外国的学术文化，移到中国旧社会里，也每每不能加以正确的吸收，发挥它的进步作用，反而被反动统治者利用，发生危害的后果。
    解放后，有了马克思列宁主义做为指南，为了适应社会主义建设的需要，许多在旧社会被忽视和轻视的东西，如中医，旧剧、杂技等都得到了应有的重视和提高，承继与发扬，发挥其伟大的进步作用。
    我相信，我们有了马克思列宁主义的武器，有了“百家争鸣”伟大正确的方针的指导，无论中国哲学史上的优秀遗产，和西方的古典哲学，都可以得到中国人民的承继、发扬和提高，一定能发挥伟大的作用，放射出无限的光明。
