Xinhua News Agency, January 12th – The Ministry of Construction Engineering has overfulfilled the 1956 construction and installation work plan by 3.5%. The total construction area completed throughout the year was more than five million square meters, of which 1.38 million square meters were industrial buildings, and considerable achievements were made in developing technical strength and saving raw materials.

Xinhua News Agency, January 12th – The construction and installation tasks undertaken by the Ministry of Construction Engineering in 1957 are initially determined to increase by approximately 15% compared to 1956. Most of the national key construction projects undertaken by the ministry during the first Five-Year Plan will be completed and put into production this year.

Recently, the Ministry of Construction Engineering convened a meeting of bureau directors and managers, preliminarily summarizing the work of 1956 and arranging the main tasks for this year, especially the first quarter. The meeting proposed that the basic requirements for this year's work are to deeply carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, implement the policy of running enterprises diligently and frugally, vigorously improve technical and management levels, and complete and overfulfill this year's construction and installation tasks in a relatively balanced manner on the basis of good quality and saving resources.

The meeting believes that, based on the existing construction strength, it is entirely possible to complete and overfulfill this year's tasks. However, there are still certain difficulties in the supply of building materials, especially steel. In order to ensure that key construction projects can be completed and put into production on schedule or ahead of schedule, the meeting requires all construction enterprises, in addition to rationally arranging this year's construction plans, must pay attention to saving raw materials in all aspects of this year's construction. In terms of saving steel reinforcement, in addition to continuing to promote measures such as cold processing of steel reinforcement this year, measures such as prestressed reinforced concrete components will also be promoted. In terms of saving wood, the experience of replacing wood with bamboo will be widely promoted this year, and the loss rate of templates should be reduced as much as possible. In terms of saving cement, those effective saving experiences from last year will continue to be promoted.

The meeting emphasized that in completing this year's plan, greater efforts must be made to improve project quality and reduce costs, and to oppose the phenomenon of blindly pursuing progress while neglecting quality, safety, and cost. All enterprises and units must further improve production and operation management in accordance with the spirit of running enterprises diligently and frugally, vigorously improve the technical level of employees, strictly control labor plans, give full play to the production potential of existing prefabrication processing enterprises and various mechanical equipment, save investment in mechanized construction, streamline organizations, improve leadership, strengthen the work of grassroots organizations, and strive to complete this year's construction tasks on schedule.

    建筑工程部贯彻增产节约精神
    要求进一步节省钢材水泥提高质量
    据新华社12日讯　建筑工程部已经超额3.5％完成了1956年承担的建筑安装工作计划。全年完成的建筑面积共有五百多万平方公尺，其中有一百三十八万平方公尺的建筑面积是工业建筑，并在发展技术力量、节约原材料等方面取得了不小的成绩。
    新华社12日讯　1957年建筑工程部承担的建筑安装任务，初步确定大约比1956年增长15％。这个部在第一个五年计划期间所承担的国家重点建设工程，将有大部分在今年内竣工投入生产。
    最近，建筑工程部召开了局长、经理会议，初步总结了1956年的工作，同时对今年，特别是第一季度的主要工作作了安排。会议提出，今年工作的基本要求是，深入开展增产节约运动，贯彻勤俭办企业的方针，大力提高技术水平和管理水平，在好和省的基础上比较均衡地完成和超额完成今年的建筑安装任务。
    会议认为，从现有的施工力量来看，完成和超额完成今年的任务是完全可能的。但是，在建筑材料，尤其是钢材的供应上还有一定的困难。为了保证各项重点建设工程能够如期和提前竣工投入生产，会议要求各建筑企业除了要合理地安排今年的施工计划以外，在今年的施工中必须从各方面注意节约原材料。在节约钢筋方面，今年除了继续推行钢筋冷加工等项措施以外，还将推行预应力钢筋混凝土构件等措施。在节约木材方面，今年将大量推行以竹材代替木材的经验，并且尽量减少模板的损耗率。在节约水泥方面，也将继续推行那些去年行之有效的节约经验。
    会议强调指出，在完成今年的计划中，必须更加努力提高工程质量和降低成本，反对盲目赶进度而忽视质量、忽视安全和成本的现象。各个企业单位要根据勤俭办企业的精神，进一步改善生产经营管理，大力提高职工技术水平，严格控制劳动力计划，充分发挥现有的预制加工企业和各种机械设备的生产潜力，节省机械化施工方面的投资，精简机构，改进领导，加强基层组织的工作，努力争取按期完成今年的建筑任务。
