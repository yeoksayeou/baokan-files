Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 5th - Henan Province has formulated its 1957 industrial and agricultural production plan based on the spirit of "increasing production and practicing economy, ensuring key projects, and appropriately shrinking the scope." Although investment is reduced, increased production can still be guaranteed.

The total investment planned for the province in 1957 is 39.78% less than the actual investment in 1956. However, the plan requires the total output value of local industry to reach 713.94 million yuan for the year, an increase of 11.99% over 1956; the total grain output to reach 26 billion jin, an increase of 2.1 billion jin over 1956; and cotton to reach 4.3233 million dan, an increase of 921,000 dan over 1956.

In the process of formulating the 1957 production plan, relevant units in Henan Province, after repeated discussions and research, reduced many investments that could be undertaken or postponed, so that investment could be used as much as possible in key areas that can maximize economic results and tap existing production potential to increase production. For example, in terms of industrial production, the main focus is on ensuring increased production of electricity, bricks and tiles, and raw coal. In 1957, the province only needs to increase electricity by 25.96% to change the past situation in Anyang, Kaifeng, and Xuchang, three cities with a relatively large number of local state-owned industries, where work was often stopped due to insufficient power, thereby fully realizing the production potential of the existing industries in these cities, and both output value and output can be increased. An increase of more than 30% in bricks and tiles throughout the province will be able to guarantee support for national key construction projects in Sanmenxia, Luoyang, Pingdingshan and other places. In agricultural production, the focus of investment is mainly on water conservancy construction, cultivating agricultural technical forces, increasing pig raising, and expanding the amount of fertilizer applied to farmland.

### 减少投资　积极增产  河南省订出1957年工、农业生产计划

    减少投资　积极增产
    河南省订出1957年工、农业生产计划
    新华社郑州5日电　河南省根据“增产节约，保证重点，适当收缩”的精神制定出来的1957年工业、农业生产计划，虽然投资减少，仍然可以保证增产。
    计划规定的1957年全省的总投资，比1956年的实际投资减少了39.78％。但是计划要求地方工业的总产值全年要达到七亿一千三百九十四万元，比1956年增长11.99％；粮食总产量达到二百六十亿斤，比1956年增产二十一亿斤；棉花达到四百三十二万三千担，比1956年增产九十二万一千担。
    河南省在制定1957年生产计划的过程中，有关单位经过反复讨论研究以后，削减了许多可办可缓办的投资，使投资尽量用在最能发挥经济效果和挖掘现有生产潜力增加生产的重点中去。如在工业生产方面，主要保证电力、砖瓦、原煤的增产。在1957年，全省只要增加25.96％的电力，就可以使安阳、开封、许昌三个地方国营工业较多的城市，改变过去常因电力不足而停工的状况，从而使这些城市现有工业的生产潜力得到充分发挥，产值和产量都能够增加。全省增加30％多的砖瓦，就能够保证支援国家在三门峡、洛阳、平顶山等地的重点建设工程。在农业生产上，投资的重点主要放在兴修水利、培养农业技术力量、增加养猪和扩大农田施肥量等方面。
