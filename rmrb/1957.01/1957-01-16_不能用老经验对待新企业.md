    Cannot Be Treated with Old Experience
    The Datong Cement Plant is China's first modern cement plant with a high degree of mechanization. However, many problems were discovered during the trial production process. For example, after the switchboard was repaired, the engineer did not inspect it but ordered the power to be turned on. After the power was on, no signal was given, and the workers proceeded to work without testing, resulting in a personal injury accident. Due to continuous equipment and personal injury accidents, the mining workshop's original three-day trial run plan was extended for more than forty days.
    The calcination workshop planned to ignite the first large kiln on December 18, 1956. Only then it was discovered that all the water pipes were frozen, and some pipes had burst, forcing a postponement. Previously, the deputy director of production had discovered that workers had turned the wrong switch and let water into the calcination workshop's pipes. Although the factory director had asked the plumbing section chief to drain the water and also made arrangements for the workshop director, the section chief completely ignored it, and the workshop director did not check. As a result, there was panic at the last minute, and the time was delayed.
    The workshop was so chaotic, and the situation in the functional departments was the same. A car driver casually drove the fire truck out for fun, and as a result, the car fell into a ditch and was damaged.
    Why are there so many accidents and such chaos in the workshops and departments of the Datong Cement Plant? This is mainly because the plant's leaders have an insufficient understanding of the complexity of the trial production of such a new type of factory, and they overestimate the favorable conditions. They believe that the factory has a complete set of new equipment and expert guidance for installation, so the problems will not be too big. They are satisfied with the old factory's set of technical management experience and did not promptly study the new situation and establish systematic rules and regulations. At the same time, they have not escaped the circle of事務主義 [a derogatory term for focusing on trivial administrative details] and have taken on problems that some functional departments could solve. The factory's Party committee also did not pay attention to the production preparation work and did not play the role of collective leadership.
    The Party and government leaders of the Datong Cement Plant should learn from their mistakes, strengthen collective leadership, establish a responsibility system, and give full play to the enthusiasm of all employees to strive for early production.

    不能用老经验对待新企业
    大同水泥厂是我国第一座机械化程度较高的新型水泥厂。可是在试生产的过程中，发现了很多问题。例如，配电盘停车修好后，工程师未作检查，就命令输电开车，通电后又不挂讯号，工人也没有试验就进行工作，结果发生人身事故。由于设备和人身事故不断，矿山车间原订三天的试车计划，一直延续了四十多天。
    烧成车间计划1956年12月18日点第一台大窑。临时才发现水管道全部冻结，个别管道已经冻破了，不得不改期。事先，生产副厂长已经发现工人弄错开关，把水放进了烧成车间的管道。当时厂长虽然要水暖工段长把水放出来，也给车间主任作了布置，但是，工段长根本没有理这回事，车间主任也没有检查。结果临事惊慌，拖延了时间。
    车间这样混乱，职能科室的情况同样如此。一个汽车司机随便把消防车开出去玩，结果车子掉到沟里摔坏了。
    大同水泥厂为什么事故这样多，车间和科室这样混乱呢？这主要是因为厂里的领导人对这样一个新型工厂试生产的复杂性认识不足，而且把有利条件估计得过高。他们认为工厂是全套新设备，又有专家指导安装，问题不会太大。他们满足于旧厂的一套技术管理经验，没有及时研究新的情况，建立系统的规程制度。同时又没有脱出事务主义的圈子，把有些职能科室可以解决的问题也揽起来了。厂的党委对于生产准备工作也不闻不问，没有发挥集体领导的作用。
    大同水泥厂的党、政领导人员，应该吸取教训，加强集体领导，建立责任制度，发挥全体职工的积极性，争取早日投入生产。
