Title: Making a Fool of Oneself in Public

It seems that the position of the U.S. Secretary of State is indeed a difficult one, as it requires the extraordinary ability to turn black into white. Even Dulles, who started as a lawyer and considers himself eloquent, often makes a fool of himself in public when he takes on such a role. Recently, Dulles testified in both the Senate and the House of Representatives for days to promote the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Although he exhausted all his tricks of deception, he inevitably ended up in an embarrassing situation due to the numerous flaws in his arguments.

The new U.S. aggression plan, labeled with the "Eisenhower Doctrine" trademark, uses the so-called "threat of communism to the security of the Middle East" as a guise. This guise has already been exposed by public opinion in Middle Eastern countries. The people of the Middle East simply do not believe in any communist threat and point out that what threatens the security of the Middle East is not communism, but Western colonialism. But Dulles still insists on making an issue of the "Soviet invasion threat," which is indeed not an easy task. Anyone who is not deliberately wearing colored glasses can see that there is not a single Soviet soldier or military base in any Middle Eastern country. The Soviet Union has consistently pursued a policy of equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries. On the contrary, the United States has military bases and troops stationed on the territory of many Middle Eastern countries, and the U.S. Sixth Fleet, equipped with atomic weapons, is cruising in the Mediterranean Sea not without purpose. Isn't it clear who is threatening the security of the Middle East? Then, what facts can Dulles produce to prove that the Middle East region is in "danger" of being ruled by "international communism"? His argument is that the Soviet Union's land, sea, and air forces are stationed in the Black Sea, Ukraine, the Caucasus, and Central Asia, which are close to the Middle East. What strange logic! Even elementary school students know that Ukraine and the Caucasus are Soviet territories, and Central Asia has five Soviet republics. Why shouldn't Soviet troops be stationed there? Why does the stationing of troops by the Soviet Union on its own territory constitute a threat to the Middle East, while the United States occupying military bases in the territories of Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and other countries thousands of miles away from its own country does not threaten the security of the Middle East?

Dulles also had to admit that Soviet troops were not stationed in places like Ukraine, the Caucasus, and Central Asia only today. He said, "This is not a new situation." But Dulles said, "It has a new meaning today."

What new factor has suddenly made the stationing of troops by the Soviet Union on its own territory a threat to the security of the Middle East? Dulles explained that until recently, some Western European countries provided "significant deterrent power" in the Middle East, but this "deterrent power" has been greatly weakened for various reasons. Dulles is clearly referring to the failure of the British and French invasion adventure against Egypt, which resulted in a so-called "power vacuum." Therefore, the United States must immediately "fill" this "vacuum" to strengthen the weakened "deterrent power." But the facts have already proven that the "significant deterrent power" of Western European countries in the past was actually aimed at the people of Middle Eastern countries. It was they who launched a war of aggression against Egypt not long ago. And now the United States wants to use its own armed forces to strengthen this "deterrent power." Isn't its purpose to suppress the national independence movement of the people of Middle Eastern countries? In this way, Dulles unintentionally removed the anti-Soviet and anti-communist smoke screen covering the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and exposed its true colonialist face.

Dulles also cited another factor that created a "critical" situation in the Middle East. He said, "There is an indication that communist rulers may now be considering the possibility of using 'volunteer soldiers' in the Middle East." Dulles's statement is not without reason. When Britain and France launched a war of aggression against Egypt, the people of many countries expressed their willingness to respond to the Egyptian government's call and volunteer to go to Egypt to support the Egyptian people in resisting aggression, just as the Egyptian people recently expressed their willingness to volunteer to support the Yemeni people in resisting British aggression. This all stemmed from hatred for the aggressors and sympathy for the anti-colonialist people. It showed the solidarity of the world's peace forces. But according to Dulles, this righteous action will become a reason for the United States to carry out armed intervention. In this way, Dulles once again unconsciously tore off the anti-colonialist mask that the United States has always worn.

The set of fallacies about the "Soviet invasion threat" that Dulles painstakingly fabricated even made experienced U.S. senators feel that it was a bit improper, and they demanded that the government provide new evidence of the Soviet threat to the Middle East. Dulles helplessly admitted that he "did not know of any new evidence." This time, Dulles not only made a fool of himself, but also made his boss look bad, because the main argument in Eisenhower's Middle East message was also that the Middle East was facing a serious "international communist threat."

In fact, Dulles might as well completely abandon these flowery words and directly state the true purpose of the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Or, like the American oil industrialist Thomburg, openly declare that "the activities of American monopoly capital in the Near East" require the U.S. government to adopt the "Eisenhower Doctrine," this "bold intervention policy"; or, like U.S. Admiral Erell, bluntly say that "the U.S. global strategic plan needs Middle Eastern oil." This might be easier to get cheers in the U.S. Congress. And Dulles could suffer less.

### 当场出丑

    当场出丑
    看来美国国务卿的确是一个难当的角色，因为它需要有颠倒黑白的非凡本事。就是以律师起家、自以为巧言善辩的杜勒斯干上了这样的行当，也要经常当众出丑。杜勒斯最近为了鼓吹“艾森豪威尔主义”，连日在参众两院中作证，虽然使尽了偷天换日的看家本领，也免不了因为破绽百出而弄得狼狈不堪。
    贴着“艾森豪威尔主义”商标的美国侵略新计划，是以所谓“中东安全面临共产主义威胁”作为幌子的。这个幌子已经被中东国家的舆论所戳破了。中东人民根本不相信有什么共产主义的威胁，并且指出：威胁中东安全的不是共产主义，而是西方的殖民主义。但是杜勒斯却仍要在“苏联侵略威胁”这个问题上做文章，这的确不是一件容易的事情。只要不是故意戴上有色眼镜的人，都会看得见，在中东任何一个国家中都没有苏联的一兵一卒，没有一个苏联的军事基地，苏联对中东各国一贯执行平等和不干涉内政的政策。相反的，美国在中东许多国家的领土上有着军事基地和驻军，装备有原子武器的美国第六舰队在地中海中并非无目的地游弋。谁威胁着中东的安全，不是很明白的吗？那末，杜勒斯能够拿出什么事实来说明中东地区有落入“国际共产主义”所统治的“危险”呢？他的论据是苏联的陆、海、空军驻扎在黑海、乌克兰、高加索和中亚细亚这些接近中东的地区。多么奇怪的逻辑！小学生都知道，乌克兰、高加索都是苏联的领土，中亚细亚有着五个苏联的加盟共和国。苏联的军队为什么不应该驻扎在那里呢？为什么苏联在自己的领土上驻扎军队就构成了对中东的威胁，而美国在远离本国数千英里的沙特阿拉伯、土耳其等国家的领土上霸占着军事基地反而不威胁中东的安全？
    杜勒斯也不得不承认，苏联的军队并不是今天才驻扎在乌克兰、高加索和中亚细亚等这些地方的。他说：“这不是新的情况。”但是杜勒斯说：“它在今天具有新的意义。”
    究竟有什么新的因素使得苏联在自己的领土上驻军忽然成了对中东安全的威胁呢？杜勒斯解释说：最近以前某些西欧国家在中东提供了“重大的威慑力量”，而这种“威慑力量”由于若干原因大为削弱了。杜勒斯显然是指英法对埃及的侵略冒险遭受失败，因而出现了所谓“势力真空”。所以美国非立即去“填补”这种“真空”，以加强被削弱了的“威慑力量”不可。但是事实已经证明，过去西欧国家的“重大的威慑力量”的矛头，实际上是针对中东各国人民的，正是它们在不久以前对埃及发动了侵略战争。而美国现在却要使用自己的武装部队来加强这种“威慑力量”，它的目的不是要镇压中东各国人民的民族独立运动是什么？这样，杜勒斯就无意间拨开了掩盖着“艾森豪威尔主义”的反苏反共的烟幕，而暴露出了它的殖民主义的真面目来。
    杜勒斯还举出另外一个造成中东“危急”局势的因素。他说：“有这样一种迹象：共产党统治者现在可能从在中东可能使用‘志愿军’这个角度来考虑问题”。杜勒斯这种说法不是没有来由的。在英法发动侵略埃及的战争的时候，许多国家的人民都曾纷纷表示愿意响应埃及政府的呼吁，志愿到埃及去支援埃及人民抵抗侵略，就像埃及人民最近愿意志愿支援也门人民抵抗英国侵略一样。这都是出自对侵略者的愤恨和对反殖民主义的人民的同情。它显示了世界和平力量的团结。但是根据杜勒斯的说法，这种正义的行动却将成为美国进行武装干涉的理由。这样，杜勒斯又再一次不自觉地撕破了美国一直戴着的反殖民主义的假面具了。
    杜勒斯费煞苦心编造的一套“苏联侵略威胁”的谰言，甚至连美国老练的参议员们也觉得是有点不像样，他们要求政府提出苏联对中东的威胁的新证据来。杜勒斯无可奈何地承认：他“不知道有什么新证据”。杜勒斯这一下不仅自己出了丑，而且使得他的上司也出了丑。因为艾森豪威尔的中东咨文中的主要论据也是：中东面临着严重的“国际共产主义威胁”。
    其实，杜勒斯倒不如完全抛开这些花言巧语，把“艾森豪威尔主义”的真正目的直截了当地说出来。或者像美国石油工业家汤贝格那样公开宣告：“美国垄断资本在近东的活动”要求美国政府采取“艾森豪威尔主义”这种“大胆干涉政策”；或者像美国海军上将艾勒尔那样直言无隐：“美国的全球战略计划需要中东的石油”。这样也许反而会更容易在美国的国会中得到喝采。而杜勒斯也就可以少吃点苦头。
