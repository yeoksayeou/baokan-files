Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 6th - According to a report in the "Social Messenger" on the 5th, President Sukarno and the Cabinet will actively contribute to coping with and resolving the events occurring in Sumatra. He is unwilling to see a cabinet crisis occur at this time, nor is he willing to discuss cabinet issues before the Sumatra events are resolved.

The newspaper stated that the president expressed this attitude during a recent meeting with the leaders of various government parties.

According to news reports, many mass organizations in various regions continue to express their support for the president and the government in resolving the Sumatra events. The Public Works Union and the Central Java Representative Conference of the People's Youth League have both expressed support for the Supreme Commander's orders regarding the Sumatra events. The Semarang City Council also passed a resolution at a recent meeting supporting the Supreme Commander and the government, and the resolution also expressed opposition to any attempts to overthrow the government without going through the parliament.

The Central Java branch of the Independence Defenders Organization decided at a recent meeting that it did not agree with the central committee of the party's decision to withdraw ministers from the cabinet. This decision was immediately opposed by party members as soon as it was made.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 6th - The "Indonesian Torch" reported on the 5th that Hatta's conditions for being willing to govern, which he put forward some time ago, have aroused suspicion among political figures in Jakarta. The only political party able to accept Hatta's conditions is the Indonesian Socialist Party, and most of the central committee members of the Masyumi Party.

The Indonesian "Torch" newspaper said that the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association bluntly stated that it could not accept those conditions. One of the central committee members of this party said that accepting Hatta's conditions would be tantamount to letting him be a "de facto dictator."

The Indonesian Islamic Union Party also stated that it could not accept those conditions.

The Indonesian Nationalist Party believes that raising the issue of Hatta as Prime Minister is premature. This is an inappropriate action because the Sastroamidjojo Cabinet is still standing strong.

The Christian Party and the Catholic Party merely "shrugged" at this matter.

"People's Daily" commented on the 5th that Hatta's remarks only revealed his desire to be a dictator, treating the parliament, elections, voters, and the people as a passing breeze. The commentary said, "Never give a dictator the opportunity to govern."

According to the "Greater Indonesia Daily" published on the 3rd, Hatta stated during a conversation with Firdaus, a member of the executive committee of the Masyumi Party, that he was willing to be Prime Minister, but the parliament must agree to let him govern until the next general election. According to Antara News Agency reports, Hatta's private secretary, Wangsa Wijaya, denied on the evening of the 4th that Hatta had a conversation with Firdaus.

    苏加诺不愿内阁发生危机
    大部分政党不欢迎哈达出任总理
    新华社雅加达6日电　据“社会使者报”5日报道，苏加诺总统将和内阁一道积极贡献力量以应付和解决在苏门答腊发生的事件。他不愿意看到内阁在这时候发生危机，也不愿意在苏门答腊事件解决以前讨论内阁问题。
    这家报纸说，总统在最近接见各政府党的领袖时表示了这个态度。
    据报纸消息，各地许多群众团体继续表示支持总统和政府去解决苏门答腊事件。公共工程工会和人民青年团中爪哇代表会议都表示支持最高统帅就苏门答腊事件所发布的命令。三宝垅市议会在最近的一次会议上也通过了支持最高统帅和政府的决议，决议还表示反对任何不通过国会去推翻政府的企图。
    独立保卫者组织中爪哇分会在最近一次会议上决定不同意这个党的中央委员会关于从内阁撤回部长的决定。这个决定在刚作出的时候，就已经立即遭到党内人士的反对。
    新华社雅加达6日电“印度尼西亚火炬报”5日报道，哈达前些日子提出的愿意执政的条件引起了雅加达政界人士的怀疑。唯一能够接受哈达这些条件的政党只有印度尼西亚社会党，此外还有马斯友美党的大部分中央委员。
    印度尼西亚“火炬报”说，印度尼西亚伊斯兰教师联合会干脆表示它不能接受那些条件。这个党的一位中央委员说，接受哈达的条件无异是让他做“事实上的独裁者”。
    印度尼西亚伊斯兰联盟党也表示不能接受那些条件。
    印度尼西亚国民党认为现在提出哈达出任总理的问题未免过早。这是不适当的行动，因为直到现在沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁还屹立着。
    基督教党和天主教党对这件事只是“耸耸肩”。
    “人民日报”5日评论说，哈达的这些言论只是暴露出他想当独裁者，而把国会、选举、选民和人民当作一阵风。评论说，决不要给独裁者以执政的机会。
    据“大印度尼西亚报”3日刊载，哈达同马斯友美党执行委员会委员菲尔道斯谈话时曾经表示，他愿意当总理，但是国会必须同意让他执政到下次大选。据安塔拉通讯社报道，哈达的私人秘书旺萨·威贾亚已经在4日晚否认哈达同菲尔道斯作过访问谈话。
