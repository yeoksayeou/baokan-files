Xinhua News Agency, 26th:
    In order to contribute two holiday days to ease coal supply shortages, the State Council called on coal miners to overproduce during the Spring Festival. The Ministry of Coal Industry and the Coal Miners' Union called on coal mine workers nationwide to respond positively.
    Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The State Council issued a notice on the 25th regarding "Emergency Measures to Resolve the Coal Shortage in the First Quarter."
    The notice stated that despite the efforts of all parties, the tight supply of coal in the first quarter remains. If emergency measures are not taken, it will affect industrial production and the supply of coal for civilian use. Therefore, the State Council calls on all coal mine workers to work diligently, promote the excellent tradition of hard work and diligence among coal miners, and only take one day off during the Spring Festival, continuing production as usual on the other two days. These two days' production should be treated as overproduction beyond the first quarter's plan, in order to ease the current tension of coal supply falling short of demand.
    In order to ensure the realization and completion of this glorious task, the notice requires that the People's Committees of all provinces and cities, and the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League organizations in all mining areas, should be actively mobilized. Under the unified leadership of the local Party committees, they should go deep into the masses of workers, conduct extensive mobilization work, and repeatedly explain the political significance of taking this measure to all coal mine workers. Furthermore, they should make specific work arrangements from the perspectives of planning, organization, and technical measures, based on the different conditions in each region. They should try every possible means to do a good job in organizing to ensure normal worker attendance. They should help workers solve the difficulties they encounter in attending work during the Spring Festival, and make good arrangements for the supply of New Year's goods to coal mine workers during the Spring Festival. They should actively create conditions to do a good job in Spring Festival maintenance, ensure quality, and strive to shorten the maintenance time. When organizing Spring Festival production, they should pay more attention to safety and production preparation work.
    The notice finally instructed the Ministry of Coal Industry to make specific arrangements according to the above instructions, and the provinces and cities should designate specific leaders to be responsible for leading and inspecting this work. The Ministry of Electric Power Industry should notify local power plants to ensure the supply of electricity for coal mine production. The Ministry of Railways should guarantee train departures and transportation during the Spring Festival holiday.
    Xinhua News Agency, 26th: According to the State Council's notice on "Emergency Measures to Resolve the Coal Shortage in the First Quarter," the Ministry of Coal Industry and the National Committee of the China Coal Miners' Union issued a decision to all coal mines nationwide on the 26th, calling on all coal mine workers to promote the excellent tradition of hard work and diligence, and during this year's Spring Festival, to devote two holiday days to normal production, and to treat these two days' production as overproduction beyond the first quarter's plan.
    The decision stated that coal mine workers have always been working diligently and hard in socialist construction. Under the current situation of coal supply falling short of demand, all coal mine workers will certainly respond more actively to the call of the State Council.
    The decision pointed out that although the production of two days is only several hundred thousand tons, it has the greatest practical significance for easing the current supply shortage; it also has a significant role in ensuring the continuation of industrial production and the supply of coal for civilian use in the first quarter of our country. The decision believes that this is the greatest contribution of all coal mine workers to socialist construction.
    The decision finally called on all levels of administration and labor unions to go deep into the masses and into the worksites under the leadership of the Party committee, actively publicize the important significance of ensuring attendance and increasing production to the workers, and take measures to ensure safe production. At the same time, they should organize cultural and recreational activities for the festival and coordinate with the supply departments to do a good job in festival supply.
    In order to earnestly implement the instructions of the State Council, the Ministry of Coal Industry, led by Minister Chen Yu and Assistant Ministers Liu Xiangsan and Zhong Ziyun, has personally led several work groups to Shenyang, Harbin, Taiyuan, Jinan and other regions to supervise the work.

    国务院号召煤矿工人春节超额采煤
    煤炭工业部和煤矿工会要求全国煤矿职工积极响应
    新华社26日讯　国务院在25日发出关于“解决第一季度煤炭紧张的一个紧急措施”的通知。
    通知说，第一季度煤炭供不应求的紧张情况，虽然经过各方面的努力工作，但仍然存在。如果不采取紧急措施将会影响工业的生产和民用煤的供应。因此国务院号召全体煤矿职工应当以紧张的劳动，发扬煤矿工人艰苦勤劳的优良作风，在春节期间只放假一天，其他两日照常生产。把这两天的产量作为第一季度计划以外的超额生产，以缓和当前煤炭供不应求的紧张情况。
    为了保证这个光荣任务的实现和完成，通知要求各省市人民委员会，各矿区党、政、工、团，应积极地动员起来，在各地党委的统一领导下，深入职工群众，进行广泛的动员工作，反复地向全体煤矿职工说明采取这一措施的政治意义。并且根据各地不同情况，从计划上、组织上、技术措施上进行具体的工作安排。要想尽一切办法做好保证工人正常出勤的组织工作。帮助职工解决他们春节出勤中的困难，做好春节中对煤矿职工的年货供应。积极创造条件做好春节的检修工作，保证质量，力争缩短检修的时间。在组织春节生产时更要重视安全和生产的准备工作。
    通知最后指示煤炭工业部应根据上述指示进行具体部署，各省市应在领导同志中指定专人负责领导和检查这一工作。电力工业部应通知各地发电厂保证煤矿生产中的电力供应。铁道部应保证春节假日的发车和运输工作。
    新华社26日讯　煤炭工业部和中国煤矿工会全国委员会根据国务院发出的关于“解决第一季度煤炭紧张的一个紧急措施”的通知，在26日向全国煤矿发出决定，要求全体煤矿职工发扬艰苦勤劳的优良作风，在今年春节期间，抽出两天假日照常生产，并把这两天的产量作为第一季度计划以外的超额生产。
    决定说，煤矿职工在社会主义建设中，一直是辛勤艰苦地进行劳动的。在目前煤炭供不应求的情况下，全体煤矿职工一定会更加积极地响应国务院的号召。
    决定指出，两天的产量虽然仅有几十万吨，但是对缓和当前供应紧张情况有着最大的现实意义；对保证第一季度我国工业生产的持续和民用煤的供应，也有着重大的作用。决定认为，这就是全体煤矿职工对社会主义建设的最大贡献。
    决定最后还要求各级行政和工会要在党委领导下深入群众，深入现场，积极向职工宣传保证出勤、增加生产的重要意义，并且要采取措施，保证安全生产，同时还要组织好节日的文化娱乐活动和协同供应机关做好节日的供应工作。
    煤炭工业部为了认真贯彻国务院的指示，已由部长陈郁和部长助理刘向三、钟子云等，亲自领导几个工作组前往沈阳、哈尔滨、太原、济南等地区督导工作。
