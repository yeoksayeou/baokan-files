Xinhua News Agency, January 5th, New York dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee continued its discussion on the Korean issue on the 4th.

    The US representative first independently proposed a resolution on this issue, the substantive part of which reiterated the goal of achieving "a unified, independent, and democratic Korea under representative government" based on the "basic principles" of resolutions previously passed by the UN General Assembly under US manipulation. These "basic principles" actually aim to have the United Nations, as a belligerent party, unilaterally dictate the resolution of the Korean issue, and to force the Korean people to abandon their right to prepare for and conduct national elections without foreign interference.

    The US proposal also requested the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea (UNCURK) to "observe and report on electoral conditions throughout Korea," and requested "all states and all authorities to assist the Commission in this activity."

    US Representative Edward Greenbaum spoke on this proposal. He also requested that the Syngman Rhee regime of South Korea be allowed to participate in the United Nations. In his speech, he touted South Korea's so-called "democracy" and "free elections."

    Greenbaum made many unfounded attacks against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and slandered the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for "violating" the Korean Armistice Agreement.

    Indian Representative Menon, in his speech, requested to reserve the right to speak in detail on this issue later. He expressed opposition to the US request that the UNCURK inspect elections throughout Korea. Menon said that the US proposal "seeks to give the Commission a power that it was not intended to have when it was established," and he requested that the United States amend its own proposal.

    Representatives from Britain, Belgium, Canada, Brazil, and Thailand also spoke at the Political Committee meeting. In their speeches, they expressed support for the US proposal.

    Committee Chairman Belaund concluded the meeting and announced that it would reconvene on the morning of the 7th to continue the discussion.

    联大政委会继续讨论朝鲜问题
    美国又提出企图侵犯朝鲜人民权利的提案
    新华社5日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会4日继续讨论朝鲜问题。
    美国代表首先在会上单独地提出一项关于这个问题的提案，这个提案在实质部分中重申，要根据联合国大会过去在美国操纵下通过的决议中的“基本原则”来实现下述目标：“在代议制政府下建立一个统一的、独立的和民主的朝鲜”。这些“基本原则”实际上就是要由作为交战一方的联合国来独断朝鲜问题的解决，并且要朝鲜人民放弃在不受外来干涉的情况下准备和进行全国选举的权利。
    美国提案还要求联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会“对朝鲜各地的选举情况进行视察和提出报告”，并且要求“所有国家和所有当局协助这个委员会的这项活动”。
    美国代表爱德华·格林博姆就这个提案作了发言。他还要求让南朝鲜的李承晚政权参加联合国。他在发言中吹嘘南朝鲜的所谓“民主”以及“自由选举”。
    格林博姆对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国作了许多毫无根据的攻击，并且污蔑朝鲜民主主义人民共和国“违反”朝鲜停战协定。
    印度代表梅农在发言中要求保留以后对这个问题作详尽发言的权利。他对美国提出的要求联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会视察全朝鲜的选举一节表示反对。梅农说，美国提案“想给这个委员会在它建立时没有打算给它的一种权力”，他要求美国修改它自己的提案。
    在政治委员会会议上发言的还有英国、比利时、加拿大、巴西和泰国的代表。他们在发言中表示支持美国提案。
    委员会主席贝朗德最后宣布休会，到7日上午再开会讨论。
