Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 8th. The Polish Council of Ministers recently approved the 1957 investment plan.

The Chairman of the Planning Committee under the Council of Ministers, Mr. Jędrychowski, told a reporter from "People's Tribune" that this year's planned investment expenditure is about 47.5 billion zlotys, a decrease of about 6 billion zlotys from the 53.336 billion zlotys originally planned in the draft of the Five-Year Plan (1956-1960). If the original amount were followed, investment in 1957 would increase by about 13% compared to 1956. Under the current economic situation, this is unrealistic.

When drafting the 1957 investment plan, the fact that last year's investment plan was not completed must first be considered. It is estimated that in 1956, investment expenditure in the socialist economy and credit loans to the non-socialist economy totaled 47.25 billion zlotys. This is equivalent to about 92% of the plan.

We must also consider the financial situation in 1957. Last year, wages increased significantly, and they will continue to increase this year. The increase in personal consumption will inevitably lead to changes in the distribution of national income.

When explaining the main direction of industrial investment expenditure in 1957, Mr. Jędrychowski said that compared with 1956, investment expenditure in light industry, agriculture and food industry, and other sectors that meet market needs will increase by 13%. In heavy industry, the plan stipulates a substantial reduction in expenditures on the machine-building industry, the petroleum industry, and the metallurgical industry. The amount of expenditure in the chemical industry will be the same as last year.

Investment expenditure in the coal mining industry will increase by more than 7%, investment in the power industry will increase by 18%, and the largest increase in investment expenditure will be in the building materials industry (an increase of 34%).

Investment expenditure in socialist and individual farming will increase by approximately 20% in total. This primarily means that the state will further greatly increase assistance to individual agriculture. Because based on the current situation of cooperative agriculture, loans to cooperative agriculture have been reduced to 250 million zlotys, and investment expenditure in state machine stations has also been reduced. Loans to individual agriculture have increased by 150 million zlotys, and loans to farmers for purchasing machinery have increased by 100 million zlotys. These loans will total 700 million zlotys.

The supply of building materials to rural areas will be greatly increased.

The plan stipulates that enterprises building houses for construction workers should complete 111,500 houses for use in 1957, which is the same as the original plan.

In 1956, this aspect of the plan was not completed, and only 88,000 houses were built, about 20,000 less than planned. The total number of 111,500 houses planned to be built this year includes these 20,000 houses. This year, the state's construction expenditure has decreased, while loans for individual construction have increased threefold compared to 1955, reaching 400 million zlotys, and this fund will be able to build more than 30,000 houses.

Mr. Jędrychowski said that the changes in the 1957 investment plan will have a considerable impact on the revision of the entire Five-Year Plan. The proportion of total investment expenditure has changed.

In addition, since the construction of some new heavy industrial enterprises must be cancelled or the construction of some heavy industrial enterprises that have already begun must be stopped, the entire development of Polish heavy industry in the next few years will inevitably be affected.

First, investments that cannot quickly achieve production results in the next few years, as well as investments in projects that rely on imported materials paid for in foreign currency for construction, will be abandoned. Investments in special industries and defense industries have been greatly reduced. The construction of office buildings will be slowed down to the greatest extent.

    波部长会议通过今年投资计划
    投资支出比原定计划减少；增加对轻工业和农业的投资；取消或停止一些重工业新企业的建设
    新华社华沙8日电　波兰部长会议最近通过了1957年投资计划。
    部长会议所属计划委员会主席英德里霍夫斯基对“人民论坛报”记者发表谈话说，今年计划的投资支出约为四百七十五亿兹罗提，比五年计划（1956—1960年）草案原定的五百三十三亿三千六百万兹罗提减少大约六十亿兹罗提。如果按照原来规定的数目，1957年的投资比1956年要增加大约13％。在目前的经济情况下，这是不现实的。
    在拟订1957年投资计划的时候，必须首先考虑到去年的投资计划没有完成这一事实。据估计，1956年对社会主义经济的投资支出和对非社会主义经济的信用贷款共计四百七十二亿五千万兹罗提。这相当于计划的大约92％。
    我们还必须考虑到1957年的财政情况。去年，工资有了很大的增长，今年还将继续增长。个人消费的增加必然会造成国民收入分配的改变。
    英德里霍夫斯基在说明1957年工业投资支出的主要方向的时候说，同1956年比较，轻工业、农业和食品工业以及其他适应市场需要的部门的投资支出将增加13％。而在重工业方面，计划规定相当大地削减机器制造工业、石油工业和冶金工业的支出。化学工业的支出数目将同去年一样。
    采煤工业的投资支出将增加7％以上，动力工业的投资将增加18％，投资支出增加最大的是建筑材料工业（增加34％）。
    社会主义化的和个体经营的农业的投资支出将共增加大约20％。这首先意味着国家将进一步大大增加对个体农业的帮助。因为根据合作化农业目前的状况，对合作化农业的贷款已经减少到二亿五千万兹罗提，而国家机器站的投资支出也减少了。对个体农业的贷款增加了一亿五千万兹罗提，对农民购买机器的贷款增加了一亿兹罗提。这些贷款将共达七亿兹罗提。
    供应乡村的建筑材料将大大增加。
    计划规定，建筑工人住宅的企业要在1957年建成十一万一千五百间房屋以供使用，这同原来计划的数字一样。
    1956年，这方面的计划没有完成，只建筑了八万八千间房屋，比计划约少两万间。今年计划建筑的十一万一千五百间房屋的总数里就包括这两万间。今年国家的建筑支出减少了，而个人建筑的贷款比1955年增加了三倍而达到四亿兹罗提，用这笔资金将能够建筑三万多间房屋。
    英德里霍夫斯基说，1957年投资计划的变动对整个五年计划的修改会有相当大的影响。整个投资支出的比例有了变动。
    此外，由于必须取消一些重工业新企业的建设或者停止某些已经开始的重工业企业的建设，就不能不对今后几年内波兰重工业的整个发展发生影响。
    首先放弃的是那些在今后几年内不能很快得到生产效果的投资，以及靠用外币支付的进口物资来进行建设的那些工程的投资。特种工业以及国防工业的投资已经大大减少。机关房屋建筑将放慢到最大限度。
