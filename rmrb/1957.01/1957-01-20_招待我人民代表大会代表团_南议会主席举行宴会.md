Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, 19th: On January 18th, at noon, the Chairman of the Yugoslav Federal National Assembly, Pijade, held a banquet at the Parliament Building to welcome the Chinese National People's Congress delegation headed by Peng Zhen.

Among those attending the banquet were the Vice-Presidents of the Yugoslav Federal National Assembly, Simić and Šenčur, the Vice-President of the Federal Executive Council, Đurašković, the President of the Federal Council of the Assembly, Zeković, the President of the Producers' Council, Božičković, members of the Federal Executive Council Gošnjak, Marković, and Popivoda, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Secretariat for Foreign Affairs, Vidić, the President of the Executive Council of the People's Republic of Serbia, Veselinov, the Chairman of the Belgrade City People's Committee, Minić, and more than sixty others. The Chinese Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Wu Xiuquan, and diplomatic officials from the embassy were also invited to the banquet. Pijade and Peng Zhen spoke at the banquet in succession.

Pijade's Speech:
Dear Vice Chairman Comrade, dear comrades:

Today, I am very happy to be able to welcome here, in the hall of the people's representative organ of Yugoslavia, such a delegation – a delegation from the friendly and fraternal supreme people's representative organ of the People's Republic of China – the National People's Congress. We believe that your visit will make a new and significant contribution to the further development of the existing friendly relations between our two countries. I wish you a smooth and successful visit to the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia.

We are very pleased to be able to affirm here that the effective cooperation and mutual ties between our two countries are growing day by day, and your visit also demonstrates this. Although the People's Republic of China and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia are geographically far apart, the rich experience of historical development links us together. Despite the distance, our experiences have much in common and are similar in many respects. In the past, in order to win our national independence and lay the foundation for socialist development, the people of our two countries had to wage arduous struggles and made great efforts for this.

The long-term struggle waged by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the beloved Chairman Mao Zedong has always been deeply sympathized by the Yugoslav people and has become a source of inspiration for our soldiers and a force to strengthen their confidence in the victory of their struggle.

Whether in China or in Yugoslavia, this struggle has led to historically significant revolutionary changes for the development of our two countries. The significance of this change goes beyond our national borders.

In addition to the common struggle in recent years, our two countries are now linked together by our efforts to build socialism. Of course, in this regard, due to specific conditions, there are certain differences between us, and therefore we may have different views on some issues, but these differences not only cannot hinder the continued development of our friendly cooperation, but also serve as a rich source of exchange of experience between us. We believe that our two countries' cooperation in this area will not only benefit the well-being of our people, but also contribute to the development of international relations and world peace. Especially in recent years, the People's Republic of China has made contributions to setting an example of peaceful coexistence policies and stabilizing the world situation through its peace-loving policies. Naturally, the people of our country also support with great sympathy China's just demands for resolving the issue of the People's Republic of China's representation in the United Nations and returning Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland. We are deeply convinced that your delegation's visit will enable us to further understand China through you. To this day, many people from our country have visited China and brought back very good impressions. Your visit will also enable us to learn more about China's development and its achievements. We are pleased that during your two-week visit to Yugoslavia, you will have the opportunity to visit several of our republics and get a general impression of our social development.

I am convinced that your visit, like many other delegations exchanged between our two countries in the recent period, will surely achieve great success and contribute to strengthening our friendship and mutual cooperation.

Finally, in once again sincerely welcoming you, Vice Chairman Comrade, please allow me to raise my glass and wish you and all members of your friendly delegation good health, wish the People's Republic of China happiness and prosperity, for the sincere friendship between our two peoples, and for the long life of the Chairman of the People's Republic of China, the beloved Comrade Mao Zedong! Cheers!

Peng Zhen's Speech:
Dear Comrade Pijade, dear comrades:

Thank you for your invitation, and thank you for your warm welcome and cordial reception. The friendship between our two socialist brotherly countries of China and Yugoslavia, like the friendship between China and Yugoslavia and other brotherly countries, has a deep foundation. The people of our two countries share the common goals of peace, democracy, and socialism, and have closely related interests; we have Marxism-Leninism as the fundamental guideline for our actions; and we have principles such as mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence as guidelines for handling mutual relations between our two countries. It is precisely because of this that the friendship between the people of our two countries has not only been established in the struggle against the common enemy, namely imperialism and its running dogs, and in the process of building socialism, but is also constantly developing. The development of this friendly relationship is in the interests of the people of China and Yugoslavia, and in the interests of all socialist countries and all other peace-loving countries and peoples. We believe that through the friendly visit of our delegation, through direct contact between the two parliaments, and through close ties and exchanges between parties and governments and people's organizations, our friendly and cooperative relations will be continuously developed and strengthened. Let us raise our glasses, for the consolidation and development of friendly relations between the two countries, for the health of our host Comrade Pijade, for the prosperity and happiness of the people of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, and for the health of the President of Yugoslavia, Comrade Tito! Cheers!

    招待我人民代表大会代表团
    南议会主席举行宴会
    新华社贝尔格莱德19日电　1月18日中午，南斯拉夫联邦国民议会主席皮雅杰在议会大厦设宴招待以彭真为首的中国全国人民代表大会代表团。
    出席宴会的有南斯拉夫联邦国民议会副主席西米奇和申丘尔茨，联邦执行委员会副主席乔拉柯维奇，议会联邦院主席泽契维奇、生产者院主席鲍日契维奇，联邦执行委员会委员戈什尼亚克、马尔科维奇、波比伏达，外交国务秘书处副秘书长维迪奇，塞尔维亚人民共和国执行委员会主席维塞林诺夫，贝尔格莱德市人民委员会主席米尼奇等六十多人。中国驻南斯拉夫大使伍修权和大使馆外交官员也应邀出席了宴会。皮雅杰和彭真在宴会上相继讲了话。
      皮雅杰的讲话亲爱的副委员长同志，亲爱的同志们：
    今天我非常高兴能够在南斯拉夫人民代表机关的大厅里，以联邦国民议会和我自己的名义欢迎这样的代表团——友好的兄弟般的中华人民共和国最高人民代表机关——全国人民代表大会的代表团。我们相信，你们的这次访问对于进一步发展我们两国之间现有的友好关系将会作出新的有意义的贡献。预祝你们在南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的访问顺利和成功。
    我们非常高兴的是能在这里肯定地说，我们两国间有成效的合作和相互联系正在日益发展，你们的访问也表明了这一点。中华人民共和国和南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国虽然在地理上相距十分遥远，但是历史发展的丰富经验却将我们联系在一起。尽管相距遥远，然而我们的经验有许多是共同的，在许多方面又是相近似的。过去，为了争取自己的民族独立和奠定社会主义发展的基础，我们两国人民曾经不得不进行艰苦的斗争，并且为此作了巨大的努力。
    中国人民在中国共产党和敬爱的毛泽东主席领导下所进行的长期斗争一直为南斯拉夫人民所深切同情，并且成为鼓舞我国战士的源泉和坚定他们对自己斗争胜利的信心的力量之一。
    不论在中国和在南斯拉夫，这一斗争为我们两国的发展导致了具有历史意义的革命变革。这一变革的意义超出了我们的国界。
    除了近年来共同斗争以外，现在我们两国为建设社会主义的努力也把我们联结在一起。当然在这方面由于具体条件，我们之间还有某些不同之处，因而我们可能对若干问题的看法不一致，但是这种不同不仅不能妨碍我们之间友好合作的继续发展，而且是相互间交流经验的丰富源泉。我们相信，在这方面我们两国合作不仅对我们人民的福利有好处，而且也有助于国际关系的发展和世界的和平。特别在最近几年，中华人民共和国以爱好和平的政策为国际间树立共处政策和稳定世界局势作出了贡献。很自然，我国人民也怀着巨大的同情支持中国关于解决中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权问题和使台湾回到祖国怀抱的正义要求。我们深信，你们代表团的这次访问，将使我们能够通过你们更进一步地了解中国。到今天为止，我国已经有许多人访问过中国，带来了十分美好的印象。你们的访问也将使我们能更多的了解中国的发展和它的成就。我们感到高兴的是你们在南斯拉夫两周访问期间将有机会访问我们的几个共和国，对于我国的社会发展得到一个总的印象。
    我深信，你们的访问将和最近期间我们两国交换的很多的其他代表团一样，一定会取得很大成就，对加强我们的友谊和相互合作做出贡献。
    最后，在再一次真诚地向你们表示欢迎的时候，副委员长同志，请允许我举杯，祝你和你的友好代表团的全体成员身体健康，祝中华人民共和国幸福和繁荣，为我们两国人民的诚挚友谊，为中华人民共和国主席、敬爱的毛泽东同志万寿无疆，干杯！
      彭真的讲话亲爱的皮雅杰同志，亲爱的同志们：
    感谢你们对我们的邀请，感谢你们对我们热烈欢迎和亲切接待。我们中南两个社会主义的兄弟国家的友谊和中南两国同其他兄弟国家的友谊一样，是有着深厚的基础的。我们两国人民有着和平、民主、社会主义事业的共同奋斗目标和休戚相关的利害关系，有着马克思列宁主义的思想作为行动的根本准绳，有着互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利和和平共处等原则作为处理两国间相互关系的指针。正是因为这样，我们两国人民间的友谊不但已经在反对共同敌人，即反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中，在建设社会主义的过程中建立了起来，而且正在不断地发展着。这种友好关系的发展是符合中南两国人民的利益的，是符合所有社会主义国家和其他一切爱好和平的国家和人民的利益的。我们相信，通过我们代表团的友好访问，通过两国议会的直接接触，通过党和政府及人民团体的密切联系和来往，我们友好合作的关系将获得不断的发展和加强。让我们举杯，为了两国友好关系的巩固和发展，为了我们的主人皮雅杰同志的健康，为了南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的繁荣和人民幸福，为了南斯拉夫总统铁托同志的健康，干杯！
