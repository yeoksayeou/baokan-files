Taiwan Situation

    Taiwan newspapers reveal that more than 30,000 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers (approximately half of the discharged Chiang Kai-shek soldiers) who were discharged due to old age, weakness, or disability are living miserable lives as displaced persons in Taiwan. The news states that recently, more than 30 old, weak, and disabled Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who were discharged from Kinmen and returned to their hometowns in Taipei County have become beggars on the streets because their houses were dilapidated and destroyed, and their land was seized by landlords. As for the discharged Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who were originally from the mainland, their lives are even more desolate. Lei Liqun, who once served as a brigade commander in the Chiang Kai-shek army and was originally from the mainland, works as a minor clerk in the Taipei Tax Bureau after his discharge. Because his income is meager and insufficient to support his family, and his house was forcibly demolished by the Taiwan authorities as an "illegal structure," his entire family of seven has nowhere to live. Driven to desperation, Lei Liqun committed suicide by taking poison.

    退伍官兵生活悲惨
    台湾报纸透露，因老弱残废退伍的蒋军官兵三万多人（约占退伍蒋军官兵的一半），在台湾过着流离失所的悲惨生活。消息说，最近由金门退伍回到台北县家乡的三十多名老弱残废的蒋军士兵，因为家中房屋破旧倒毁，田地被地主霸占，以致流落街头，成为乞丐。至于原籍大陆的退伍蒋军官兵，生活更加凄凉。曾在蒋军中当过旅长的雷励群，原籍大陆，退伍以后，在台北税捐处任小职员，因为收入微薄，不能赡养家庭，房屋又被台湾当局指为“违章建筑”强行拆除，全家七口无处安身。逼得雷励群无路可走，因而服毒自杀。
