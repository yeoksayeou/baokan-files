China's Forestry Construction

China is the country with the richest variety of tree species in the world; however, the forest area is very small and the distribution is very uneven. This situation is detrimental to agricultural production and also affects industrial construction. We should immediately begin to change this situation. Within twelve years, the forest area in the country should be increased from 7.9% to 18% of the total land area. State-owned afforestation and mass afforestation and forest protection work should be further strengthened.

China is the country with the richest variety of tree species in the world, growing more than 5,000 species of woody plants suitable for temperate, frigid, and tropical regions. Of the approximately 30 genera of Pinaceae plants in the world, China has 20 genera; among them, Chinese fir, golden larch, metasequoia, Chinese red pine, Taiwan fir, Fujian cypress, and Chinese swamp cypress are seven genera unique to China. China has even more broad-leaved tree species, and there are countless unique genera, including Eucommia, Davidia involucrata, Eclipta prostrata, lychee, and fragrant fruit. Some of them are valuable timber trees; some are important economic trees; some bloom beautiful flowers; and some bear delicious fruits.

However, at present, China's forest area is not large and the distribution is uneven. This situation has a great impact on China's economic construction.

The country's existing forest area is about 76.6 million hectares, accounting for 7.9% of the country's land area, and the timber reserves are about 4.9 billion cubic meters. Calculated on the basis of the country's 600 million people, each person has only about 0.13 hectares of forest land and about 8 cubic meters of timber. The Soviet Union's forest area is 742.6 million hectares, averaging 3.5 hectares of forest per person, which is about 27 times more than the average per person in China. The limited forests we have are also very unevenly distributed. The northeast corner of China, known as the "sea of trees" (including Heilongjiang, Jilin, and northern Inner Mongolia), accounts for less than one-tenth of the country's land area, but its forests account for 40% of the country's total forest area; the vast northwest region, which accounts for one-third of the country's land area, has only 7% of the country's total forest area. Looking at the distribution of forests in each province, it is also very uneven. For example, the forest area of Heilongjiang Province accounts for 30% of the province's land area; Hebei Province accounts for 3.6%; and Xinjiang only accounts for 1.5%.

The lack of forests has resulted in severe soil erosion in many areas, causing years of water, drought, and sandstorm disasters, hindering the development of agricultural production. The shortage of timber and the uneven distribution of timber-producing areas have caused many difficulties in industrial and transportation construction in some areas. For example, the coal mines in North China need hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of mine props every year, and all of this timber needs to be transferred from Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and Central South China. The timber freight accounts for more than half of the allocation price. Sometimes, the coal mine construction is affected because the allocated timber is not delivered in time. For example, if the Lanzhou-Xinjiang and Baotou-Lanzhou railways in the Northwest region are not quickly afforested for protection, they will be in danger of being attacked by shifting sands.

If we do not try to expand the forest area and increase the timber reserves, and if we continue to harvest more than 400 million cubic meters of timber every year as the Soviet Union does now, the country's existing forests will be depleted in twelve years. If the rate of afforestation cannot keep up, and the amount of logging is permanently maintained at the current level, it will affect the speed of China's socialist industrialization.

Centuries of continuous disasters tell us that we must plant trees to fight against nature. The current shortage of timber supply also prompts us to immediately begin to change this extremely backward situation in forestry.

China has certain favorable conditions for developing forestry production: China has a vast territory and is suitable for cultivating various trees that grow in frigid, tropical, and temperate zones according to different climates, rainfall, and other conditions; China already has many tree species, and it will not be too difficult to collect tree species; Many people of all ethnic groups in China have rich experience in forestry production and forest management techniques, and some people in some areas even rely mainly on forestry management for their livelihoods; as long as we are good at relying on them, the potential of forestry production can be further exploited.

Since the liberation of the mainland, the People's Government has begun to carry out afforestation, forest protection, and forest survey and design work in a relatively comprehensive manner. Now, more than 400 state-owned forest farms and more than 5,000 afforestation stations have been established across the country, and technical regulations for afforestation, seedling cultivation, and seed collection have been formulated. From 1950 to the first half of 1956, more than 10.34 million hectares of forests have been planted across the country. The number of trees planted in 1956 alone averaged every twenty-two days, which exceeded the number of trees planted during the entire Kuomintang rule (300,000 hectares).

According to the preliminary plan formulated by the Ministry of Forestry, from 1956 to 1967, within twelve years, the country will plant forests on 105 million hectares of barren mountains and wasteland. Among them, about 66 million hectares are timber forests, and the remaining 30 million hectares are protection forests and special economic forests such as mulberry, tea, camellia, tung oil, and fruit trees, and the railways, highways, rivers, and cities and villages should be rapidly greened. It is expected that after the implementation of this plan, the area of ​​forests in the country will increase from the current 7.9% to 18%, which can basically play a role in regulating the climate and conserving soil and water. At the same time, the increase in timber reserves for the country will also be able to meet the needs of the country and the people for timber in a few years.

Now, the timber trees planted in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou and other provinces will gradually become forests. The result of large-scale timber forest planting in these areas will also gradually change the situation that timber production was previously biased towards Northeast China and Inner Mongolia. In recent years, special economic forests such as oil tea, camphor, tung oil, and sapium sebiferum in the Jiangnan area, cork oak, tung oil, and ash in the southwest area, cork oak and walnut in the central China mountains and Shaanxi, cinnamon and anise in Guangxi, and coconut, coffee, and rubber in Guangdong and Yunnan have all developed greatly.

In more than 160 counties, cities, and banners in the western part of Northeast China, the eastern part of Inner Mongolia, the eastern part of Henan, the western part of Hebei, the northern part of Shaanxi, and the lower reaches of the Yongding River, where wind, sand, water, and drought disasters are more serious, the state has formulated a plan to build protection forests. After the plan is completed, it can protect and transform more than 20 million hectares of farmland. In addition, plans for building protection forests have been formulated for the Hexi Corridor in Gansu, the Turpan Basin and the edge of the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang, the northern foot of the Tianshan Mountains, and Hainan Island, and some have already begun construction.

The protection forests that have grown up have begun to have the effect of preventing wind and sand and protecting farmland. For example, on the old course of the Yellow River in eastern Henan, the former sandy wasteland is now surrounded by willows and poplars, and covered with green shade. The local agricultural production cooperatives and state-owned farms have cultivated more than 13,000 hectares of wasteland in this area, planting wheat, peanuts, cotton, soybeans, millet, and other crops, and opened up an orchard of more than 3,000 mu, planting apples, pears, grapes, and so on. In the Yulin area of ​​northern Shaanxi, half of the area was sandy wasteland before liberation. Due to the threat of wind and sand, Yulin County was forced to move three times. Since liberation, from 1950 to 1955, more than 30,000 hectares of forests have been planted. Strips of forest belts have appeared on large areas of sandy wasteland. Poplars and paulownia have grown to more than two zhang high. Crops are no longer threatened by wind and sand, and yields have increased by one to four times.

The method of closing mountains for forest cultivation created based on the experience of the working people in China has created favorable conditions for afforestation and has played a significant role in rapidly restoring forests. During China's first five-year plan, the main areas for closing mountains for forest cultivation were the barren mountains and sparsely forested areas in the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River, Huai River, Yongding River, Lao Ha River, Rao Yang River, and Liao River. Mountains were also closed for forest cultivation in areas of farmland water conservancy projects such as reservoirs, hydroelectric power stations, river dams, and terraced fields.

In terms of forest protection, in addition to the mountain closure method, the state has also actively adopted many measures. For example, grassroots forest protection organizations have been established relying on the peasant masses, forest protection teams have been established in important forest areas, firebreaks have been opened, observation towers have been established, and aerial forest protection has been implemented in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and other places. However, mountain fires still occur constantly in remote forest areas. For example, in April and May of last year, major fires occurred continuously in the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains. The forest land destroyed accounted for 80% of the area damaged by mountain forests across the country during the same period. In the future, modern technical measures will be gradually adopted to strengthen forest protection and fire prevention work. Such as building roads in major forest areas, setting up communication equipment, carrying out chemical fire prevention in forest areas, using helicopters to put out fires, and implementing forest fire danger weather forecasts, etc., in order to completely eliminate the biggest enemy of forests - mountain fires. In recent years, work such as drug poisoning and manual beating has also been carried out in the prevention and control of forest diseases and insect pests, and preparations are being made to further investigate the situation of forest diseases and insect pests and take scientific prevention measures. Now, many regions have formulated plans for the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, requiring the elimination of major forest diseases and insect pests within five to seven years.

In order to harvest enough timber to supply the needs of national construction, while taking into account soil and water conservation and the renewal of afforestation sites, the Ministry of Forestry has formulated a trial regulation on the main logging of state-owned forests based on advanced Soviet experience and China's specific conditions, requiring comprehensive implementation in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia forest areas, and the improvement of the current logging work according to local conditions in the Southwest and Northwest regions.

Now, more than 900 forest management offices have been established in forest areas across the country, managing forests that account for about half of the national state-owned forest area. They are responsible for protecting forests and implementing forest logging regulations.

Over the past seven years, the state has conducted forest management surveys in important forest areas and formulated operating plans for the Changbai Mountain, Bailongjiang, Lesser Khingan Mountains, and upper reaches of the Minjiang River forest areas; operating plans for the Greater Khingan Mountains, Mudanjiang, Qinling, Hainan Island, and Jinsha River forest areas are also being prepared.

In order to find out the national forest resource situation, a huge forest survey team is working hard in the deep mountains and dense forests, revealing the secrets of many primitive forests. The forestry department is preparing to basically determine the national forest resources this year and propose a preliminary direction for the rational management and utilization of forests as the basis for the state to formulate a long-term forestry construction plan.

    我国的林业建设
    我国是世界上树种最丰富的国家；但是，森林面积很小，分布得很不均匀。——这种情况既不利于农业生产，也影响了工业建设。——应该立即着手改变这种状况。——十二年内要使全国森林占国土的面积由7.9％增加到18％。——国营造林和群众性的造林护林工作应当进一步加强。
    我国是世界上树种最丰富的国家，长有适于温带、寒带、热带地区生长的木本植物五千多种。全世界约有松杉科植物三十属，而中国就有二十属；其中杉木、金钱松、水杉、油松、台湾杉、福建柏、水松等七个属是我国的特产。我国的阔叶树种类就更多了，特有的属也不胜枚举，有杜仲、珙?、旱莲、荔枝、香果等属。它们有的是珍贵的用材林木；有的是重要的经济林木；有的会开美丽的花朵；有的能结鲜美的果实。
    但是，目前我国的森林面积是不大的，分布也不平衡。这种情况，对我国的经济建设影响很大。
    全国现有森林面积约七千六百六十万公顷，占全国土地面积7.9％，木材蓄积量约为四十九亿立方公尺左右，以全国六亿人口平均计算，每人只有林地零点十三公顷左右、木材八立方公尺左右。而苏联的森林面积有七万四千二百六十万公顷，平均每人有森林三公顷半，比中国每人平均量多大约二十七倍。我国仅有的这些森林，分布还很不均匀。称为“树海”的中国东北角（包括黑龙江、吉林和内蒙古北部）的土地面积不足全国面积的十分之一，但它们所有的森林占全国森林总面积的40％；辽阔的西北地区，占全国土地面积的三分之一，而森林面积仅占全国森林总面积的7％。从各省森林的分布情况看，也是很不均匀的，如黑龙江省的森林面积占全省土地面积的30％；河北省占3.6％；新疆仅占1.5％。
    森林缺乏的结果，许多地区发生严重的水土流失现象，造成连年的水、旱、风沙灾害，妨碍农业生产的发展。木材不足，生产木材的地区又很不平衡，一些地区的工业、交通建设就发生了不少的困难。如华北地区各煤矿，每年需矿柱几十万立方公尺，这些木材，全部需要从东北、内蒙古和中南等地调来。木材运费，占调拨价格一半以上。有时还因为调拨木材不及时，影响煤矿建设。又如西北地区的兰新、包兰铁路线，如果不迅速造林庇护，就有遭受流沙侵袭的危险。
    如果我们不设法扩大林地面积，增加木材蓄积量，而每年又像苏联现在一样地采伐四亿立方公尺以上的木材，全国现有的森林，十二年就会被伐光。如果因为造林速度赶不上去，而把伐木数量永远保持在现有水平上，就会影响我国社会主义工业化的速度。
    千百年来连年不断的灾荒告诉我们，必须造林来同自然作斗争。目前木材供应不足的情况，也促使我们立刻着手改变林业这种极端落后的状况。
    我国发展林业生产是具备一定的有利条件的：我国幅员辽阔，适于根据各地不同的气候、雨量等条件，培植在寒带、热带和温带生长的各种树木；我国已有的树木种类很多，收集树种不会有太大困难；我国各族人民中，有许多人具有丰富的林业生产经验和营林技术，有些地区的人民甚至主要靠经营林业维持生计；只要善于依靠他们，林业生产的潜力就能更多地发挥出来。
    自从全国大陆解放以后，人民政府就着手比较全面地进行造林、护林和森林调查设计工作。现在，全国已经建立了四百多个国营林场，五千多个造林站，制定了造林、育苗、采种等技术规程。从1950年到1956年上半年，全国已造林一千零三十四万多公顷。只1956年一年中平均二十二天造林的数目，就超过了国民党整个统治时期中造林的数目（三十万公顷）。
    根据林业部制定的初步规划，从1956年到1967年的十二年内，全国将在一亿零五百万公顷的荒山荒地上造起森林来。其中用材林约为六千六百多万公顷，其余三千多万公顷为防护林和桑、茶、油茶、油桐、果木等特种经济林，并且要使铁路、公路、河流两旁，以及城市、村庄的周围迅速绿化起来。预计这个规划实现以后，全国森林占国土的面积，将从现在的7.9％增加到18％，基本上可以起调节气候、保持水土的作用。同时，为国家增加的木材蓄积量，也将能满足若干年后国家和人民用材的需要。
    现在，江苏、浙江、福建、安徽、江西、湖南、湖北、广东、广西、四川、云南、贵州等省种植的用材树木都将逐渐成林。这些地区大规模造用材林的结果，也将逐渐改变过去木材生产偏于东北、内蒙古地区的情况。最近几年，江南地区的油茶、樟树、油桐、乌桕，西南地区的栓皮栎、油桐、白蜡，华中山地和陕西的栓皮栎、核桃，广西的肉桂、八角，以及广东、云南的椰子、咖啡、橡胶等特种经济林，都有很大的发展。
    在风沙水旱灾害威胁比较严重的东北西部、内蒙古东部、河南东部、河北西部、陕西北部、永定河下游等地的一百六十多个县、市、旗范围内，国家制定了营造防护林的计划。计划完成以后，可以保护和改造二千多万公顷的田地。此外，甘肃河西走廊一带、新疆吐鲁番盆地、塔里木盆地边缘，和天山北麓、海南岛地区，都已经制定营造防护林计划，有的已经开始营造。
    已经成长的防护林，开始收到防止风沙、保护农田的效果。例如河南东部的黄河故道上，往日的沙荒地上已经是杨柳环绕、绿荫复盖，当地的农业生产合作社和国营农场已在这一带垦种一万三千多公顷的荒地，种植了小麦、花生、棉花、黄豆、谷子等农作物，开辟了一个三千多亩的果园，种植了苹果、梨、葡萄等。陕北榆林专区，解放前一半是沙荒地带，因为受风沙的威胁，榆林县城被迫迁了三次。解放以后，从1950年到1955年已造林三万多公顷，大片沙荒地上出现了一条条的林带，杨树、水桐已长到两丈多高，农作物不再受风沙威胁，产量提高了一倍到四倍。
    根据我国劳动人民的经验所创造的封山育林办法，给造林创造了有利条件，对于迅速恢复成林起了很大作用。在我国第一个五年计划期间，主要的封山育林地区是黄河、淮河、永定河、老哈河、饶阳河、辽河等河流的中上游的荒山和少林地区。对水库、水电站、河坝、梯田等农田水利工程地区也进行了封山育林。
    在护林方面，除了封山办法外，国家还积极地采取了许多措施。如依靠农民群众建立了护林基层组织，在重要林区成立护林队，开辟防火线，设立了望台，并且在东北、内蒙古等地实行航空护林。但是，在偏远林区，仍然不断发生山火。例如去年4、5月间，大小兴安岭连续发生大火，烧毁的林地，占同时期全国山林被害面积的80％。今后还要逐步采用近代化的技术措施，加强护林防火工作。如在主要林区内修筑公路、设置通讯设备、开展林区化学消防、使用直升飞机扑火，和实行森林火灾危险天气预报，等等，以便彻底消灭森林的最大敌人——山火。近几年来，在防治森林病虫害方面，也进行了药剂毒杀和人工扑打等工作，并且准备进一步调查森林的病虫害情况，采取科学的预防措施。现在，许多地区已制定防治病虫害的规划，要求在五年到七年以内消灭主要的森林病虫害。
    为了采伐足够的木材供应国家建设需要，同时又照顾到保持水土，和采伐迹地的更新成林，林业部已根据苏联先进经验和我国具体情况制定了国有林主伐试行规程，要求东北、内蒙林区全面贯彻，西南、西北地区按照这个规程因地制宜地改进现在的采伐工作。
    现在，全国各林区已建立九百多个森林经营所，管理着占全国国有林面积一半左右的森林，它们担负着保护森林，贯彻森林采伐规程等任务。
    七年来，国家已在重要林区进行了森林经理调查，制定出长白山、白龙江、小兴安岭、岷江上游林区的施业案；大兴安岭、牡丹江、秦岭、海南岛、金沙江林区的施业案也正在编制。
    为了摸清全国森林资源情况，庞大的森林调查队伍正在深山密林中进行艰苦的工作，揭开了许多原始森林的秘密。林业部门准备在今年基本上查清全国森林资源，提出初步的合理经营和利用森林的方向，作为国家制定长远的林业建设计划的依据。
