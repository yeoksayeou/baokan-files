Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, January 4th: Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali, in a policy statement to parliament on January 3rd, announced that Syria would pursue a policy of "active neutrality between East and West."

He requested a vote of confidence from the parliament for his cabinet, which had been formed four days prior.

Prime Minister al-Assali's policy statement, comprising thirty-three points, stated that Syria would continue its struggle against the Baghdad Pact. Syria would "defend ourselves by freely arming ourselves, in order to exercise our full sovereignty." He said, "The government guarantees the mobilization of the nation's spiritual and material strength to defend the nation's position."

Al-Assali said that his government would insist that the United Nations implement the resolution stipulating that Israeli troops withdraw to the 1949 armistice lines.

Al-Assali said that his new cabinet would realize the goals of the National Covenant. This covenant was passed last June and was agreed upon by all political parties and parliamentary groups.

The statement also said that the cabinet would industrialize our country by accepting unconditional military, technical, financial, and economic assistance from foreign countries, by engaging in trade, equipping our industries, and strengthening commercial relations with countries that support our economic and financial independence.

Al-Assali said that Syria would continue to support the Iraqi people's struggle against imperialist rule. The new cabinet advocates signing an expanded bilateral agreement with Egypt, including economic and cultural agreements, and providing financial assistance to the Jordanian army.
