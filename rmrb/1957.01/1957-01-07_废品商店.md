    Scrap Store
    Not long ago, a special store appeared in the Qianmen district of Beijing. The store displayed a variety of old and different telecommunications equipment, plumbing equipment, hardware tools, chemical raw materials, as well as power machines, sewing machines and other commodities, and many second-hand daily necessities.
    This store was originally a scrap wholesale department of the supply and marketing cooperative. It was established to supply the collected scrap materials to the society.
    The scrap store attracts customers from all aspects: procurement staff of local enterprises and ordinary citizens, as well as guests from other places. They often satisfactorily buy the materials they need from this store. For example, automobile accessory factories, iron factories, and electrical machinery factories buy urgently needed electric drills, aluminum tubes, machine tools, and generators and motors of various sizes from here. Guests from Shanghai, Shenyang and other places buy a large number of bearings and valve grinding machines.
    Since its opening, the scrap store has sold a total of eighty-two large and small machines and more than 1,200 kinds of hardware tools in a few months.
    The source of goods in this store is the materials that have been accumulated for a long time in the hands of some organs, factories, groups, schools and citizens. Some materials have changed their appearance after being exposed to wind, sun and rain for a long time. The supply and marketing cooperative purchases them, repairs them, and restores these materials to the commodity circulation field, becoming useful resources for production and life. ·Zheng Yu·

### 废品商店

    废品商店
    不久以前，北京市前门区出现了一个特殊的商店，店里摆着各种陈旧不同的电讯器材、水暖器材、五金工具、化工原料以及动力机、缝纫机等商品，摆着不少半新不旧的
  日用品。
    这家商店原来是供销合作社的废品批发门市部，它是为了把收购来的废旧物资供给社会需要而设立的。
    废品商店招徕各个方面的顾客：有本市企业的采购员和一般市民，也有外地的客人。他们常常满意地从这个商店买到所需要的物资。例如汽车附件厂、铁工厂、电机厂从这里买到急需的电钻、铝管、机床和大小不同的发电机、电动机。来自上海、沈阳等地的客人们买到大批轴承和磨汽门机。
    废品商店开业以来，几个月里，共销售包括大小机器八十二台和一千二百多种五金工具。
    这个商店的货物来源，都是某些机关、工厂、团体、学校和市民手中长期积压的物资，有些物资过去任凭风吹、日晒、雨打，已经变了样子；供销社把它收购进来，经过修理，使这些物资重新回到商品流通领域中，成为生产上、生活上有用的资源了。　·郑　煜·
