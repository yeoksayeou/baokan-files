    May the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples continue to develop and consolidate

    Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Vice Premier He Long, members of the government delegation and accompanying personnel, who came for a friendly visit at the invitation of the Soviet government, arrived today in Moscow, the capital of our country.

    All Soviet people heartily extend a warm welcome to the esteemed guests representing the great Chinese people and its heroic Communist Party.

    The fraternal alliance of the two great socialist countries is being consolidated and strengthened day by day, and political, economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries is developing more and more fruitfully. Our common great goals and ideals are the source of friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples and the peoples of all socialist countries. The Soviet and Chinese peoples are brothers in spirit and in revolutionary struggle traditions, and the lofty purpose of striving for a bright future for all mankind unites the two peoples.

    Soviet-Chinese friendship is based on the immortal Leninist principles of equality, mutual respect for national interests, fraternal mutual assistance, non-interference in internal affairs, and infinite loyalty to the cause of proletarian internationalism.

    The ever-strengthening unity of the socialist camp is a powerful force in the struggle for peace and socialism.

    Comrade Mao Zedong once wrote: "The friendship between the great Chinese and Soviet peoples is unbreakable because our friendship is based on... the great principle of internationalism. The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples and the peoples of all people's democratic countries, and the friendship between all peace-loving, democratic, and justice-loving people of all countries in the world, is also based on such great internationalist principles, and therefore, is unbreakable.

    Obviously, the power generated by our friendship is endless and truly invincible.

    Let all imperialist aggressors and war mongers tremble before our great friendship!"

    The unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is a great achievement of the entire socialist camp and all progressive mankind. This friendship makes the entire world socialist camp stronger and more invincible. This friendship is an impregnable obstacle on the road of imperialist aggressors and the most important factor in defending and consolidating world peace.

    The Soviet people are heartily happy for the remarkable achievements made by the Chinese people in the cause of socialist construction under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. The free Chinese people have achieved remarkable victories in the struggle to complete the first five-year plan. The socialist industrialization of the country and agricultural cooperation are being successfully realized.

    The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China determined and put forward to the Chinese people new tasks in the struggle to build socialism. The proposal for the second five-year plan, unanimously adopted by the Party Congress, is a magnificent plan to further improve the country's economy, culture and living welfare. The basic tasks of the second five-year plan are to continue industrial construction centered on heavy industry, promote the technical transformation of the national economy, establish a solid foundation for the country's socialist industrialization, continue to complete socialist transformation, enhance national defense capabilities, and improve the material and cultural living standards of the people.

    The historic victory of the Chinese people in socialist construction is inseparable from the entire activities of the Communist Party which wholeheartedly serves the people. The Communist Party of China has been able to continuously achieve victory because it has consistently been loyal to Marxism-Leninism and has used genuine creative methods to solve complex tasks based on the country's specific historical and national conditions.

    The glorious Communist Party of China is one of the most powerful Communist Parties in the modern world, and it has made outstanding contributions to the practice of scientific communism and to the theory of Marxism-Leninism. This party has demonstrated a profound creative attitude in solving the tasks of socialist revolution. Its rich experience and wisdom are valued by the entire international communist and labor movement.

    Comrade Khrushchev said at the reception to welcome the delegation of the National People's Congress of China: "In the course of the Chinese revolution, the Communist Party of China has applied the rich experience of the great October Socialist Revolution, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the experience of all fraternal communist and workers' parties. However, the Chinese Communists did not mechanically apply this experience to their own country; they creatively applied this experience based on China's own national conditions and made good use of this experience to serve the revolution and the Chinese people. The Communist Party of China, as a truly revolutionary party of the working class, is implementing a clever policy: this policy takes into account the national and social conditions of the country, unites the people, and unites the various ethnic groups of China, in order to advance towards socialism as quickly as possible."

    The People's Republic of China appears on the world stage as a powerful and active factor for peace. Together with the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people, it is fighting for the peaceful coexistence of all countries. It is resolutely exposing the conspiracies of the United States and other imperialist countries' aggressive blocs, and thwarting the evil plans of the enemies of peace. The Chinese people, together with the Soviet Union, played an important role in stopping the war of aggression against Egypt launched by British and French colonialists. People's China spoke with weight when exposing the essence of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary, which the imperialist bloc had tried to use to launch a new world war.

    The People's Republic of China is a faithful friend of the Eastern peoples who are opposing colonial oppression and striving for freedom and national independence, and is also a faithful friend of the Eastern peoples who have already freed themselves from colonial oppression and embarked on the road of strengthening national independence. The Chinese people are fighting to turn Asia into a solid fortress of peace and to strive for the unity of the Asian peoples. The peace-loving people of all countries have justly given a high evaluation to the great significance of the recent friendly visits of Comrades Zhou Enlai and He Long to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Cambodia, Pakistan, Burma, and India.

    The enemies of peace fear the rapid increase in the international prestige of the People's Republic of China, so they hinder the representatives of the People's Republic of China from obtaining seats in the United Nations. However, the world still hears the voice of the people of this great country, and no decision can be made without the will of People's China. If the United Nations wants to become a truly broadly representative international organization, then for the sake of its own prestige, it should return the seat legally belonging to the Chinese people to the Chinese people.

    The Soviet people are very concerned about the achievements of the People's Republic of China and watch its achievements with friendly sympathy. The great victory of our Chinese friends makes all Soviet people happy and fills the hearts of the Soviet people with a very natural pride.

    The Soviet people, welcoming dear Chinese friends, shout:

    May the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and China be continuously strengthened and consolidated!

    Dear friends, welcome to Moscow! (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th)

    苏联真理报1月7日社论
    愿苏中两国人民牢不可破的友谊不断发展和巩固
    应苏联政府的邀请前来作友好访问的中华人民共和国国务院总理兼外交部长周恩来同志、副总理贺龙同志、政府代表团团员和随行人员，今天到达我们祖国的首都莫斯科。
    全体苏联人民衷心向代表伟大的中国人民和它的英勇的共产党的受人期望的贵宾表示热烈的欢迎。
    两个伟大的社会主义国家的兄弟联盟日益巩固和加强着，两国之间的政治、经济和文化合作日益富有成果地发展着。我们共同的伟大目标和理想是苏中两国人民之间和各社会主义国家人民之间的友谊的源泉。苏中两国人民在精神上和革命斗争传统上是兄弟，为全人类光明前途而奋斗的崇高目的把两国人民团结起来。
    苏中友谊是以平等、互相尊重民族利益，兄弟互助，互不干涉内政的不朽的列宁主义原则，以及对无产阶级国际主义事业的无限忠诚为基础的。
    社会主义阵营各国不断加强的团结，这就是争取和平、争取社会主义斗争中的强大力量。
    毛泽东同志曾经写道：“伟大的中苏两国人民的友谊之所以是牢不可破的，因为我们的友谊是根据……伟大的国际主义的原则而建立起来的。中苏两国人民和各人民民主国家人民之间的友谊，和全世界各国一切爱好和平、民主及正义的人民之间的友谊，也正是建立在这样伟大的国际主义原则上，因此，也就是牢不可破的。
    显然，我们这种友谊所产生的力量是无穷无尽的和真正无敌的。
    让一切帝国主义侵略者和战争贩子们在我们伟大的友谊面前颤抖吧！”
    苏联同中华人民共和国之间牢不可破的友谊乃是整个社会主义阵营、全体进步人类的伟大成就。这种友谊使得整个世界社会主义阵营变得更加强大和不可战胜。这种友谊是帝国主义侵略者道路上永远攻不破的障碍，是保卫和巩固世界和平的最重要因素。
    苏联人民为中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导下在社会主义建设事业中获得的卓越成就感到衷心的高兴。自由的中国人民在争取完成第一个五年计划的斗争中获得了卓越的胜利。国家的社会主义工业化和农业合作化正在顺利地实现。
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会确定了并且向中国人民提出了建设社会主义斗争中的新任务。党代表大会一致通过的第二个五年计划的建议，是进一步提高国家经济、文化和生活福利的宏伟计划。第二个五年计划的基本任务是继续进行以重工业为中心的工业建设，推进国民经济的技术改造，建立国家社会主义工业化的巩固基础，继续完成社会主义改造，增强国防力量，提高人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平。
    中国人民在社会主义建设中取得的历史性胜利是同忠心耿耿地为人民服务的共产党的全部活动分不开的。中国共产党能够不断地获得胜利是由于它一贯忠实于马克思列宁主义，根据本国的具体历史条件和民族条件用真正的创造性办法来解决复杂的任务。
    光荣的中国共产党是现代世界上最强大的共产党之一，它给科学的共产主义实践，给马克思列宁主义的理论作出了卓越的贡献。这个党在解决社会主义革命任务时表现了深刻的创造性态度。它的丰富经验和智慧受到整个国际共产主义和工人运动的重视。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在欢迎中国全国人民代表大会代表团的招待会上说：“在中国革命的过程中，中国共产党运用了伟大的十月社会主义革命的丰富经验、苏联共产党以及所有兄弟共产党和工人党的经验。但是，中国共产党人并没有把这种经验机械地搬用于本国，他们根据中国的本国条件创造性地运用了这种经验，很好地利用这种经验为革命、为中国人民服务。中国共产党作为真正革命的工人阶级政党，执行着一种巧妙的政策：这种政策考虑到本国的民族条件和社会条件，把人民联合起来，把中国各族人民团结在一起，以便尽速地向社会主义前进。”
    中华人民共和国作为一个强大的和积极的和平因素出现在世界舞台上。它和苏联一起，和所有爱好和平的人民一起为争取各国的和平共处而斗争，它正在坚决地揭露美国和其他帝国主义国家侵略集团的阴谋，打破和平敌人的罪恶计划。中国人民和苏联一起在制止英法殖民者企图发动的侵略埃及的战争的事业中起了重要的作用。人民中国在揭露匈牙利反革命叛乱的实质的时候说了有分量的话，帝国主义集团曾经努力想利用这次叛乱来发动新的世界战争。
    中华人民共和国是正在反对殖民主义压迫、争取自由和民族独立的东方各国人民的忠实朋友，也是已经摆脱了殖民主义压迫并且走上了加强民族独立道路的东方各国人民的忠实朋友。中国人民正在为把亚洲变为坚固的和平堡垒、为争取亚洲各国人民的团结一致而斗争。爱好和平的各国人民对不久以前周恩来同志和贺龙同志对越南民主共和国、柬埔寨、巴基斯坦、缅甸和印度进行友好访问的巨大意义公正地给予了很高的评价。
    和平的敌人害怕中华人民共和国的国际威望迅速提高，所以阻挠中华人民共和国的代表取得联合国中的席位。但是，全世界还是听到了这个伟大国家的人民的声音，在违背人民中国的意志的情况下就不能作出任何一种决定。如果联合国想成为一个真正有广泛代表性的国际组织，那么它为了自己的威望起见就应该把依法属于中国人民的席位归还给中国人民。
    苏联人民十分关心中华人民共和国的成就，并且怀着友好的同情注视着它的成就。我们中国朋友的伟大胜利使全体苏联人民都感到高兴，使苏联人的心中充满了很自然的骄傲。
    欢迎亲爱的中国朋友的苏联人民高呼：
    祝苏中两国牢不可破的友谊不断加强和巩固！
    亲爱的朋友，欢迎你们来莫斯科！　（新华社莫斯科七日电）
