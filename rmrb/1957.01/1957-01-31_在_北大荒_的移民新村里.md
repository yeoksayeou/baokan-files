In the more than four hundred new villages established in the "Great Northern Wilderness" of Heilongjiang Province, the immigrants are happily celebrating their first Spring Festival after settling down and establishing their careers here.

In the immigrant new villages, every collective has rehearsed Northeast Yangko dances, Shandong fast tales, small operas, plays, and other entertainment programs, preparing for performances during the Spring Festival. The immigrants of the Duixiang New Village in Zhaozhou County are preparing to hold a get-together with the nearby long-term residents during the Spring Festival. They will perform programs from their hometowns, such as Shandong drum songs, for their neighbors.

Before the festival, some of the immigrants' families have already come to the new villages, and will settle here with their children. The land reclamation team members whose families have not yet arrived in the new villages are sending the money they have earned back home in these few days, so that their relatives can celebrate the Spring Festival in their hometowns. In Fuyu County's Fusheng Township, 60% of the team members sent money home. Su Quanming, a land reclamation team member from Xingfu Township in this county, also wrote a letter to his parents, telling them that their new village has built sixty-three houses, harvested more than 500,000 catties of grain, and everyone has new cotton-padded coats and trousers and new cotton quilts for the winter. In his letter, he also reported a great happy event to his parents: he has established love with Chen Jinfeng, a female team member who came from the same village, during labor, and they recently got married. Many land reclamation team members also received letters from relatives and friends from their hometowns before the Spring Festival, narrating the changes in their hometowns and encouraging them to settle down and produce in the "Great Northern Wilderness".

The Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee and the Shandong Provincial Immigration Bureau recently wrote Spring Festival congratulatory letters to the immigrants. The governments and Party organizations of various counties in the reclamation area have established consolation organizations that will visit the new villages and celebrate with the immigrants during the Spring Festival. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have also increased the supply of musical instruments and food to the new villages. (Xinhua News Agency)

    在“北大荒”的移民新村里
    在黑龙江省“北大荒”上建立了四百多个新村的移民们，高高兴兴地欢度在这里安家立业以后的第一个春节。
    移民新村里社社都排练了东北大秧歌、山东快书、小型歌剧、话剧等文娱节目，准备在春节演出。肇州县对喜乡新村的移民准备同附近老居户在春节期间举行联欢，他们将向邻居们演出自己故乡的节目——山东大鼓等。
    在节日前，有些移民的家属已经从故乡来到新村，将要和他们的子弟一起定居在这里。家属还没有接到新村的垦荒队员们，这几天正在把收入的钱寄回家去，让亲人在故乡欢度春节。富裕县富胜乡有60％的队员给家里寄了钱。这个县幸福乡的垦荒队员苏全明还写信告诉他的父母亲说，他们的新村已盖起了六十三间房子，收获了五十多万斤粮食，冬天大家都穿上了新棉袄棉裤，做了新棉被。他在信里还向父母报告了一件大喜事：他已经和同村前来的女队员陈金凤在劳动中建立了爱情，并且在最近结了婚。有许多垦荒队员在春节前也接到了家乡亲友的来信，对他们叙述故乡的变化，并鼓励他们在“北大荒”上安心生产。
    黑龙江省人民委员会、山东省移民局最近分别给移民们写了春节贺信。垦区各县的政府和党组织都成立了慰问组织，将在春节期间到新村和移民联欢。各地供销合作社也增加了对新村的乐器和食品的供应。　（新华社）
