Let Postal and Telecommunications Cadres Focus on Their Own Work

Liao Yulong

In many counties, the heads of postal and telecommunications bureaus often become "guerrilla bureau chiefs," either being transferred frequently and not staying long, or being constantly pulled away to focus on urgent central tasks. In Anhui Province's seventy-three county (city) bureaus, the leading cadres of thirty-four bureaus were transferred in a single year. The head of the Susong County Bureau was replaced four times in one year. A deputy head of the Fuyang County Bureau, after being in office for more than two years, was so often away participating in the county's central tasks that he didn't even recognize the bureau's messenger when he returned to the bureau. Many business personnel in county bureaus are also frequently drawn to participate in the county's central tasks. In Guangxi Province's Yongfu County Bureau, two of the four telephone operators were drawn to participate in central tasks last year. Examples like these exist in every province.

This practice of frequently transferring heads of postal and telecommunications bureaus or drawing postal and telecommunications cadres to tackle urgent central tasks in the counties has caused many negative consequences for postal and telecommunications work. With the bureau chief often absent, the bureau experiences a lack of responsibility, and management and operations are prone to problems. Although some bureaus designate someone to temporarily manage the bureau's affairs after the bureau chief is transferred, the person temporarily in charge may not be competent. For example, after the head of the Lintan Bureau in Gansu Province was drawn away by the county leadership, all matters in the bureau were entirely handled by a telephone operator. This telephone operator had to connect calls at the switchboard, handle receiving and dispatching, and also report to and seek instructions from local leading bodies and attend meetings. It is obviously impossible for him to manage the bureau's work and manage it well. In some county bureaus, after business personnel are drawn away, mail, newspapers, and magazines pile up, and after the telephone rings for a long time, there is no one on duty at the switchboard to plug in the jacks. Some county bureaus have drawn away so many business personnel that they have to shorten business hours or even suspend operations, and mobile service stations that originally existed no longer operate.

Some people think that county postal and telecommunications work is not a big deal, and that drawing out some people and temporarily putting postal and telecommunications work aside is not a problem. In fact, compared to large and medium-sized cities, although the volume of business in county postal and telecommunications bureaus is smaller, the types of business are numerous. Every county postal and telecommunications bureau is a component of the national postal and telecommunications network, and even slight negligence will inevitably affect connections with many places and bring various inconveniences to all aspects of work. Now, the Sixth National Postal and Telecommunications Work Conference has decided to strengthen the work of county (city) postal and telecommunications bureaus and appropriately expand the management authority of county (city) postal and telecommunications bureaus, making the tasks of county postal and telecommunications bureaus even heavier. If cadres are not stable, their management skills cannot be improved, and the work cannot be done well. Therefore, drawing as few leading cadres and business personnel as possible from county postal and telecommunications bureaus to participate in local central tasks, and allowing them enough time to manage their postal and telecommunications business, is a problem that needs to be seriously addressed.

    让邮电干部务正业吧
    廖玉龙
    在不少县里，邮电局长常常变成“游击局长”，不是调动频繁，干不长，就是常常被抽出来突击中心工作。安徽省七十三个县（市）局，一年中就有三十四个局的领导干部被调动。宿松县局局长一年中换了四个人。阜阳县局的一位副局长，到职两年多，因常年在外参加县的中心工作，回局时连局的传达员都不认识他了。许多县局的业务人员也经常被抽调去参加县里的中心工作。广西省永福县局四个话务员，去年给县里抽调了两个去参加中心工作。这种例子各省都有。
    这样动不动就调动邮电局长或者抽出邮电干部去突击县里的中心工作，对邮电工作造成了不少恶果。局长经常不在家，局里就出现无人负责的现象，经营管理就容易出乱子。虽然有些局长调走后，另外指定了人临时代管局务，但是，临时代管的人却未必都能胜任。如甘肃省临潭局局长被县领导机关抽调后，局里一切事务完全由一个话务员代理。这位话务员要在电话交换台接线，兼做收发，还要向地方领导机关请示、汇报工作、开会。显然要他把局内的工作管起来并且管好是不可能的。有的县局业务人员被抽走后，邮件、报纸和杂志就被积压起来了，电话铃响了好久，交换台没有人值班插塞子。有的县局业务人员被抽得太多，只好缩短营业时间，甚至停止营业，原来有流动服务站的也不流动了。
    有些人认为县邮电工作没有什么了不起，调出一些人，把邮电工作暂时放一放，没有什么关系。其实，同大中城市比较起来，县邮电局的业务量虽然少些，但是业务种类却不少。每一个县邮电局都是全国邮电网中的一个组成部分，稍有疏忽，势必牵动同很多地方的联系，给各方面工作带来种种不便。现在，第六次全国邮电工作会议决定要加强县（市）邮电局的工作，适当扩大县（市）邮电局的管理权限，县邮电局的工作任务更重了。如果干部不稳定，他们的管理水平就不能提高，工作也就不可能做好。因此，尽量少抽调县邮电局的领导干部和业务人员参加地方中心工作，让他们有足够的时间去经管他们的邮电业务，是一个需要认真解决的问题。
