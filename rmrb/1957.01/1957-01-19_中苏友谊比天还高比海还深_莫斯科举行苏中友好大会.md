Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th: A mass rally of Soviet-Chinese friendship was held by people from all walks of life in Moscow on the afternoon of the 17th at the Kremlin to welcome the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China led by Premier Zhou Enlai. Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and others met with more than 3,000 representatives of the people from all walks of life in the Soviet capital.

The Chinese and Soviet national flags were hung on the gates of the Kremlin. The meeting was held in the solemn and magnificent meeting hall inside the palace, where the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union hold important meetings.

In the center of the rostrum in the hall, on both sides of the three-dimensional statue of Lenin, hung the national flags of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Opposite the rostrum hung a banner written in Chinese and Russian, "Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship and cooperation between the people of the Soviet Union and China."

At a little after three o'clock, people had already begun to enter the Kremlin. The main hall and upstairs were filled with the masses attending the meeting.

Among those attending the meeting today were Soviet Communist Party and government leaders Bulganin, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Malenkov, Saburov, Khrushchev, Shepilov, Furtseva, Shvernik, Pospelov, and other comrades. There were also responsible personnel from the Soviet government, representatives of mass organizations, labor heroes, and figures from cultural and scientific circles.

Also attending the grand event were diplomatic envoys from various countries, as well as Soviet and foreign journalists.

At exactly four o'clock, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and Soviet Party and government leaders stepped onto the rostrum. At this moment, the masses stood up and applauded in unison, and cheered. Premier Zhou Enlai and others also applauded enthusiastically along with the masses.

The meeting was opened by Bobrovnikov, Chairman of the Moscow City Soviet Executive Committee. When he announced that the people of the Soviet capital warmly welcomed Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and the delegation members, and that the people of Moscow warmly congratulated the brotherly friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China, the masses repeatedly stood up and applauded.

The band played the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union.

Representatives of workers, intellectuals, and youth from Moscow spoke successively.

Skin Jin, a worker from the Moscow Electric Bulb Factory, addressed Chinese friends and the great Chinese people on behalf of the workers of Moscow. He said that your visit to our country is a joyful event, because the Soviet and Chinese people are brothers, brothers of one heart and one mind, brothers in the struggle to build communism and strive for world peace and happiness.

All of us in the Soviet Union pay great attention to and care about the tremendous construction work of the modest, hardworking, and heroic Chinese people. Based on our own experience, we understand that the Chinese people will still encounter many difficulties on the road to socialist construction, but we believe that the Chinese working people will overcome these difficulties under the leadership of their fighting Communist Party. In this struggle for a bright future, the Chinese people have the Soviet people as their loyal, selfless, and sincere friends, and the Soviet people are willing to help and share the experience accumulated over the past thirty-nine years at any time.

Next to speak was Professor Tsilev of the Moscow Institute of Metallurgy. He said that Soviet scientists and intellectuals pay tribute to the great Chinese people and the heroic Chinese Communist Party.

The Doctor of Technical Sciences, who had been to China to help Chinese scientists study and compile the twelve-year development plan for science, said that the scientific and technological cooperation between scientists and producers of our two countries is of great significance to the economic ties between the two countries. Soviet and Chinese scientists have already launched a huge work of cooperation. There are unlimited possibilities between the Soviet Union and China in the development of connections in all sectors of the national economy. This friendship and cooperation is strengthening the entire socialist camp.

Li Yatsytseva, an assembler at the Moscow Second Watch Factory, spoke on behalf of the Moscow Communist Youth League members and youth. She said with enthusiasm that your visit has further strengthened the friendship between the people of our two countries, a friendship that, as the Chinese say, is "higher than the sky and deeper than the sea."

She went on to say that Moscow youth pay great attention to the lives of Chinese youth and are happy for their achievements. China has a very good custom: hanging red flowers on the chests of heroes after winning labor victories. I hope that more of these wonderful flowers of happiness will appear in your country. She finally asked the delegation to convey the warm and heartfelt greetings of the Moscow youth to the Chinese youth.

Next, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Bulganin spoke (full text on page 4). His speech was warmly welcomed by the masses.

Then Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech (full text on page 4). His speech was constantly interrupted by warm applause. At the end of his speech, everyone stood up and applauded for several minutes.

Premier Zhou Enlai then shook hands with Khrushchev and Bobrovnikov, who were sitting on either side of him. At this moment, Khrushchev stood up and shouted: "Long live Marxism-Leninism!" The hall resounded again with warm, stormy applause.
