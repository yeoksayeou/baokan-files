Failing to See a Cartload of Firewood
Qi Dongye

I remember once watching the Xiang opera "Sacrificing the Headscarf." When Shi Hao, in his old age, discovered he had become a "Tanhua" (third place in the imperial examination), and joy turned to sorrow, a stage actor in the audience sighed, "This is somewhat like how we feel when we are assigned a major role!" Hearing this suddenly, one couldn't help but chuckle, but upon careful consideration, there was indeed a point to it.

It seems that it's not just in the drama world that actors rarely have the opportunity to perform. The film industry has also discovered the phenomenon of "backlogging" actors. What's most puzzling is that, despite knowing there are a large number of idle and usable actors within their own units, directors insist on selecting only a few actors when assigning roles, even going as far as traveling thousands of miles to select actors from other places. This leads to the phenomenon of the idle becoming idler and the busy becoming busier.

Those who assign roles and select actors play a significant role in resolving this issue. Some are directors, others are different people. In doing this work, the idea of "insurance" seems to play a significant role, and they always prefer to use what's readily available. In their view, people seem to be born with certain types and can only be judged according to those types; they cannot be versatile. Although they also understand acting, they don't have much faith in the plasticity and creative potential of actors. In this situation, actors who are fixed into a certain type suffer greatly. Some always play "righteous young men" or "virtuous young women" and never change. Others spend years sitting on the sidelines. The most bitter are some actors who have been acting for more than ten years and have accumulated some experience, but for a long time, they can't get a role to play. The years slip away, and in a flash, several years have passed. Seeing many comrades who have been "discovered" step forward step by step, while they remain stagnant and without progress. At the end of the year, looking back on the year, they have spent it in a bit part. They are shocked and deeply moved, and their low mood can be imagined. In this situation, occasionally, due to consideration, they get a more important role to play. Tension comes with excitement, and they are always thinking, "I finally got this role; I must not ruin it." Being overly concerned is naturally not right, but it doesn't come out of nowhere; it's definitely for a reason. And the play is often not performed well. At this time, criticism comes: "Saying he can't do it is indeed true." Later, even this opportunity will no longer exist, and the bitterness in their hearts is probably rarely known.

Thinking about changing careers! After all, they have been doing it for more than ten years. No one dares to say outright that you have no acting talent, and they are not willing to give up. Not changing careers means always playing "the masses," playing "the masses." Although all roles, no matter how small, are creative, it's generally agreed that acting as the masses for a year won't have as much impact as acting in a major role for a year! Looking forward to the future and looking back on the past, how can they not have the feeling of Shi Hao placing third in the imperial exam!

It's not easy for the country to accumulate talent. It is no small matter in the old society to dedicate oneself to the drama business for more than ten or twenty years. Among them are usable talents. With a little polishing and more experimentation, they may not be that much worse than those found thousands of miles away. The problem is to trust the masses and look at people from a developmental perspective.

When I was young, reading Mencius, when I read "One's eyesight is sharp enough to see the tip of an autumn hair, but fails to see a cartload of firewood," I always felt that it was just a metaphor used by Mencius to criticize. There probably aren't such people in the world. Now, looking at these people who set aside a large number of actors and insist on visiting other places to find real talent, I feel that they are somewhat similar. As Mencius said, "The cartload of firewood is not seen because one does not use their eyesight." This is "not doing it, not being unable to do it." Here, "eyesight" can not only be understood as eyes, but it may be helpful to add the meaning of "heart." Look more at the things around you, and feel the thoughts and hardships of people. A cartload of firewood may not be able to ignite a brilliant artistic torch. In that way, the depression of backlogged actors can be resolved. In the drama business, due to the full development of potential forces, new glory will inevitably be released.

May those who fail to see a cartload of firewood use their eyesight!

    不见舆薪
    齐东野
    记得有一次看湘剧“祭头巾”，当石灏暮年发现自己中了探花，惊喜之余悲从中来的时候，观众中一个话剧演员喟然长叹了一声：“这倒有些像我们分配到一个主要角色时的光景！”猛听起来，不免哑然失笑，而仔细玩味一下，其中却不无至意在。
    是演员而不大有机会演戏，似已不独话剧为然了，电影界也发现了“积压”演员的现象，最使人奇怪的是：明明知道自己单位中有大批空闲而且可用的演员，导演在分配角色时，偏偏只认定几个演员去选，甚至不远千里到外地去选，于是闲者闲死，忙者忙死的现象产生了。
    解决这问题，分配角色挑选演员的人起着很大的作用，他们有的是导演，有的是别的人。在做这工作中，“保险”思想似乎起着很大的作用，总是喜欢拣现成的用。照他们看来，人似乎生来就分几种型，只能就型说型，不可通用。他们虽也是懂得表演的，却不大相信演员的可塑性和创造潜能。在这种情况下，被固定成为某型的演员就吃了大亏了，有的是常年只演“正生”“闺门旦”，永无更改；有的则常年坐冷板凳。最苦的是一些演戏十多年，积累了一些经验的演员，长时期地捞不着戏演，岁月蹉跎，一晃数年，眼见得许多被“发现”了的同志一步步走上前来，自己却故我依然了无长进。年终岁暮，回顾一年又是在龙套生涯中渡过，惊心触目，感喟之深，情绪之低也就概可想见了。在这种情况下，偶尔由于照顾，得一较重的戏演，紧张随兴奋俱来，心里老在惦念着“好容易得此一戏，千万可别演砸了”。顾虑重重自然不对，然而这也不是凭空而来，确属有以致之，而且戏往往就演的不好，这时，评论又来了：“说他不行，确是不行。”以后就连这机会也不会再有了，那心底的苦楚怕是很少为人知的。
    想改行吧！毕竟搞了十多年，没有人敢正面提出你无表演天才，自己确也不甘心；不改行吧，又老是演“群众”，演“群众”。虽说角色无论大小俱是创造，然而演一年群众总不见得会比演一年重要角色收获更大吧！瞻念前途，回顾往昔，叫他怎么能没有石灏中探花之感呢！
    国家积累人材不易，旧社会中死心塌地地献身于戏剧事业十多年、二十年也非等闲，其中有的是可用之材，稍加琢磨，多多试验，未必就比迢迢千里外找来的人就次多少，问题在于要相信群众，发展地看人。
    小时读孟子，读到“明足以察秋毫之末，而不见舆薪”时，总觉得不过是孟轲比讽之言，世上未必就有这种人的，现在看看这些搁置大批演员不用，偏偏到各处另访真才的人，觉得倒是有些像了。还是孟轲说的好：“舆薪之不见，为不用明焉”，此乃“不为也，非不能也”。这里明可以不独做眼睛解，不妨加上心的意思，多看看周围的事物，多体味体味人的心思苦处，舆薪未必不可以燃起灿烂的艺术火把的。那样，积压演员的苦闷可以解决，戏剧事业中，由于充分地发挥了潜在力量，也必然可以放出新的光彩来的。
    愿不见舆薪者用明！
