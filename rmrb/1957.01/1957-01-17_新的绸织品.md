Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu dispatch: The Nanchong Silk Weaving Factory of the Southwest Silk Company, the largest machine silk weaving factory in Southwest China, has decided to produce six new products starting in the first quarter of this year: colored brocade, georgette, crepe, Oriental gabardine, Xinhua gabardine, and *yanlaihong*. In addition to using silk as raw material, these new products also incorporate rayon, rayon staple fiber, and spun silk.

Sichuan Province is one of the major silk producing areas in the country, but in the past, the silk fabrics needed in the Southwest region were mostly transported from coastal provinces such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which was not only inconvenient for transportation, but also insufficient and timely in supply. In the past, the Nanchong Silk Weaving Factory of the Southwest Silk Company could only produce flower silk and plain silk, with very few varieties, colors, and patterns. Since the fourth quarter of 1956, the factory has added new machines and raw materials, and the technicians and workers have also actively studied the production technology of new products. Therefore, it was decided to produce three new products starting in January this year, including colored brocade quilt covers, spun silk weft quilt covers, and *yanlaihong* woven with rayon and silk. The remaining three products will begin production in February. It is estimated that more than 50,000 meters of these six products will be produced each quarter in the future.

    新的绸织品
    新华社成都电　西南最大的机器织绸厂——西南蚕丝公司南充织绸厂，决定从今年第一季度开始生产有色织锦、乔其纱、无光纺、东方呢、新华呢和雁来红等六种新产品。这些新产品除了用蚕丝作原料以外，还增加了人造丝、人造棉和绢丝。
    四川省是全国主要蚕丝产区之一，但是过去西南地区所需要的丝织品却多是从沿海地区江苏、浙江等省运来供应的，不但运输不便，而且在供应上也不够充分和及时。西南蚕丝公司南充织绸厂过去只能生产花绸和素绸，品种、颜色和花样都很少。从1956年第四季度起，这个厂新添置了机器和原料，技术人员和工人也积极研究了新产品的生产技术，因此决定从今年1月份起生产有色织锦被面、绢纬被面和用人造丝、蚕丝合织的雁来红等三种新产品，其余三种产品将从2月份开始生产。预计今后每季将生产这六种产品五万公尺以上。
