Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 20th – The 1957 National Economic Construction Bond redemption lottery was held this afternoon at the Friendship Cinema of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building in Shanghai. At this lottery, three types of bonds were drawn for redemption: the third redemption lottery for the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds; the second redemption lottery for the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds; and the first redemption lottery for the 1956 National Economic Construction Bonds.

800 representatives of workers, farmers, industrialists, businesspeople, and neighborhood residents from Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian provinces and Shanghai attended the lottery. The Fifth Office of the State Council and the Ministry of Supervision commissioned the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee Finance and Trade Office and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Supervision to attend and supervise the lottery. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, at the invitation of the Ministry of Finance, entrusted the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions and the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce to appoint one representative each to conduct the lottery. A total of ten winning numbers for the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds and five winning numbers each for the 1955 and 1956 National Economic Construction Bonds were drawn at the meeting.

Bei Zhongxuan, Assistant Minister of Finance, who presided over the bond redemption lottery, said in his speech: In the past three years, the bonds purchased by the people across the country are equivalent to about one-twentieth of the state's three-year economic construction expenditure. That is to say, for every twenty factories built with the same amount of construction investment in these three years, one was built with the money from everyone buying bonds. He also said that people purchasing bonds not only support national construction and share the fruits of national construction, but also receive a certain amount of interest income. This year, the state should repay a total of more than 220 million yuan in principal and interest, of which interest alone accounts for more than 78 million yuan.

He said at the meeting that according to the regulations for the redemption of principal and interest of the 1954 and 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds, the redemption lottery for these two types of bonds was scheduled to be held in Beijing on August 10th each year. However, in order to allow bondholders to know whether they have won the lottery as soon as possible so that they can plan their personal economic lives, it was decided to combine it with the 1956 bond redemption lottery and hold it in advance on January 20th. He also stated that in order to expand the publicity of bond issuance, bond redemption lotteries will continue to be held in major cities in rotation in the future.

Rong Yiren, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Zhang Qi, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, and representatives from Shandong, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other places spoke at the meeting, expressing their determination to strive to overfulfill this year's bond subscription target.

    1957年度公债还本抽签大会在上海举行
    新华社上海20日电　国家经济建设公债1957年度还本抽签大会，今天下午在上海市中苏友好大厦友谊电影院举行。在这次抽签大会上，一共进行了三种公债的还本抽签，即1954年国家经济建设公债的第三次还本抽签；1955年国家经济建设公债的第二次还本抽签和1956年国家经济建设公债的第一次还本抽签。
    参加这次还本抽签大会的有山东、江苏、安徽、浙江、福建五省及上海市的职工、农民、工商界和里弄居民的代表八百人。国务院第五办公室和监察部委托上海市人民委员会财粮贸办公室和上海市监察局代表出席监督抽签。中华全国总工会和中华全国工商业联合会应财政部邀请委托上海市工会联合会和上海市工商业联合会推定代表各一人执行抽签。会上一共抽出1954年国家经济建设公债中签号码十个，1955年和1956年国家经济建设公债中签号码各五个。
    主持还本抽签大会的财政部部长助理贝仲选致词说：过去三年来全国人民认购的公债，约等于国家三年经济建设费用支出的二十分之一。这就是说在这三年内每建设投资额相同的二十个工厂，就有一个是用大家买公债的钱来建设的。他还说，人民购买公债，一方面支援了国家建设，分享国家建设的果实，另一方面还可以得到一定的利息收入。今年国家应偿还的本金和利息共达二亿二千多万元，其中利息即有七千八百多万元。
    他在会上说，据1954年和1955年国家经济建设公债还本付息办法规定，这两种公债还本抽签定于每年8月10日在北京举行。但为了使公债券持有人早日知道是否中签以便有计划地安排个人经济生活，因此决定和1956年公债还本抽签合并，提前在1月20日举行。他还表示，为了扩大发行公债的宣传工作，今后将继续轮流在大城市举行还本抽签大会。
    全国工商联副主任委员荣毅仁、上海市工会联合会副主席张祺以及山东、安徽、福建、江苏、浙江等地的代表都在大会上发言，表示要争取超额完成今年的公债认购任务。
