    Gratification
    Yu Fen
    Comrades all say that I have changed a lot recently, always smiling, completely different from the frowning look I had a year ago.
    Of course, I know my own affairs best; how can others understand? However, if they noticed my current happy interactions with the students, they might suddenly understand.
    Now, when I see those dozens of round, rosy faces and those over a hundred pairs of sparkling eyes gazing at me intently, as soon as class starts, I can't help but feel a warm current welling up from the bottom of my heart, spreading throughout my body. My clumsy tongue, which is usually not very good at speaking, becomes much more agile. Seeing them listening with rapt attention, I myself seem to be truly immersed in those beautiful and magical fairy-tale worlds. As soon as class is over, they immediately surround me. I am very happy to hear them say things like: "Teacher Yu, the characters you describe are so vivid and interesting." "Teacher Yu, this article is so good, it has completely captivated me." Once, I asked Tong Lisheng: "Tell me, what do you plan to do when you grow up?" He tilted his head mischievously, looked at me, blinked his little eyes playfully, thought for a while, and then replied:
  "I want to be like you, a people's teacher." Although he ran away laughing immediately, that sentence echoed in my ears for a long, long time.
    The children have become the sun in my life, and I can't bear to leave them for a moment. Hearing their clear recitations and fluent answers to questions; seeing their flat, childish handwriting, I receive a new joy and gratification.
    However, all this is not so easy to obtain. Having tasted the sweet berries on the fruit tree of this work, I had to make so much determination and put in so much labor.
    I was only assigned to teach first-year literature at this middle school last academic year. To be honest, I was very unhappy at the time. I thought: I am a university graduate, can't I do other more valuable work? Being a teacher is unpromising... But I had to obey the leadership's assignment, so I came here with suppressed anger. When I taught the first class at the beginning of the semester, the students didn't react much, just listened and watched in a daze. I was relieved, thinking that I could get by somehow. But who knew: the second, third class... things went more and more wrong. Whenever I started class, the students were always chattering and talking underneath; when I asked questions, nine out of ten people stood up without saying a word. When I asked them to read aloud, they stammered and couldn't read it out. After class, they always puffed out their little mouths and muttered: "I don't understand at all, really..." I became impatient, and I got a headache and sighed whenever I saw those messy homework books. I felt really scared and annoyed when I saw those students.
    I am grateful to our principal, he is a patient and enthusiastic person, he repeatedly helped me, encouraged me, and he made me open my eyes and recognize the real road of life ahead of me. The conscience of a citizen, the sense of responsibility of an intellectual, all prompted me to awaken. I seemed to hear a voice from the depths of my heart asking: "Is your work really worthless?" "Can't you really do a good job of teaching?"... I pondered deeply in the middle of the night, and gave a firm negative answer to these questions. I felt that I could no longer stand by and watch the boiling life!
    From that time on, I completely abandoned those heavy and dirty ideological burdens. I studied educational theory and the bits and pieces of experience in books and periodicals as if I were thirsty and hungry. I went to listen to the lectures of the old teachers like an elementary school student, and humbly asked them for advice from time to time. I prepared lessons conscientiously, not letting go of every word, every sentence, delving into it and mastering it thoroughly; whenever the night was quiet and deep, people could always see the faint light from my window. I carefully studied the students' knowledge deficiencies in the process of grading homework. I never neglected every detail and the consolidation of students' knowledge in classroom teaching. I tried to find all kinds of ways to find the key to open the door of teaching.
    Sure enough, the situation really changed slowly. I gradually felt how smart and lovely these children were, and I felt especially energetic when I was with them; and those students also followed me naturally, like children can't leave their mothers.
    Now, it is winter. After dinner, I stood alone on the steps of the campus and looked out after sending off a large group of students. The sun was setting beside the distant mountains, and the cold north wind blew in my face, but my heart was stirred by the warm spring feeling. Looking at the scattered yellow flowers on the barren grassland in front of me, I felt that I was a gardener, I was sowing flower seeds, I was watering flower seedlings. In front of my eyes, it seemed that there was already a land of brilliant flowers, a spring of bright scenery.

    欣慰
    余奋
    同志们都说我最近大大地改变了，一天到晚笑吟吟地，同一年前那种整日愁眉苦脸的样子完全不同了。
    自己的事，当然自己最清楚，别人怎么能够摸得着？不过，假使他们注意到我现在和学生们在一起的愉快情形，也许就会恍然大悟了。
    现在，一上课，当我看到那几十张圆圆的、红润润的脸，和那一百多只乌溜溜的凝神注视着我的眼睛，我就禁不住从心底涌起一股热流，扩散到全身。我的向来不大会说话的笨舌头就灵活得多了。看到他们听得出神，我自己也就仿佛真地置身在那些美丽神奇的童话般的世界中了。一下课，他们就马上团团地围住我。我很高兴听到他们这些话：“余老师，你讲的那些人物活灵活现的，真有趣。”“余老师，这篇文章真好，简直把我迷住了。”有一次，我问童丽生：“告诉我，你长大了打算干什么？”他淘气地偏起头来看着我，又顽皮地眨眨小眼睛，想了一会，才回答道：
  “学你，当一个人民教师。”他虽然马上笑着跑开了，那句话却好久好久回响在我的耳朵里。
    孩子们已经成为我的生活中的太阳，我一时一刻也舍不得离开他们。听到他们的琅琅的诵读和流畅地回答问题；看到他们的扁扁的稚气的字体，我都得到了一份新的喜悦和欣慰。
    然而这一切并不是那么容易获得的。尝到了这工作之果树上的甜美的浆果，我是下了多大的决心和付出多少劳动啊。
    我是上学年才派到这所中学里来教初一文学课的。老实说，我那时可一肚子不高兴。我想：我，大学毕业生，不能做别的更有价值的工作吗？干教师，没出息……但领导上的分配，又不能不服从，只好憋着气来了。开学上第一节课，学生们倒也没有什么反映，只是惊呆呆地听着、看着。我放心了，我认为马马虎虎也就可以对付过去了。哪里知道：第二节、第三节课……就越来越不对头了。我一上课，学生们总是在下面吃吃嚓嚓地说话；提问时，十个中就有九个人站起来一言不发。要他们朗读，又结结巴巴地念不出来。课后，他们总是一个个鼓起小嘴咕噜着：“一点也不懂，真是……”我不耐烦了，一看见那些一塌糊涂的作业簿子我就头痛，就唉声叹气。我看到那些学生，实在感到又害怕又讨厌了。
    感谢我们的校长，他是一个耐心的热情的人，他一再地帮助我，鼓励我，他使我睁开眼睛认清了自己前面的真正的生活道路。一个公民的良心，一个知识分子的责任感，都促使我觉醒过来。我仿佛听到心灵深处的一个声音问道：“你的工作真是没有价值吗？”“你确实搞不好教学吗？”……我中夜深省，对这些问题都给了一个坚决的否定的回答。我觉得我再不能对沸腾的生活袖手旁观了！
    从那时候起，我就完全抛开那些沉重的肮脏的思想包袱了。我如饥如渴地学习教育理论和书刊上的点滴经验。我像一个小学生似地去听老教师们的讲课，时时虚心地去请教他们。我踏踏实实地备课，不放过每个字、每一句，钻进去、熟透它；每当夜静更深的时候，人们总可以看到我的窗口的微弱的灯光。我在批改作业中去仔细研究学生的知识缺陷。我在课堂教学中从不忽略每一处细节和对学生知识的巩固。我想出各种各样的办法来找到打开教学之门的钥匙。
    果然，情形真的慢慢地转变了。我逐渐感到这些孩子们是多么聪明，多么可爱，和他们在一起，我感到格外精神奋发了；而那些学生们，也很自然地前前后后地跟着我，像孩子离不开妈妈一样了。
    现在，已是冬天时候了。吃过晚饭，我送出一大群学生后，独自站在校园的台阶上眺望。太阳正傍着远山落下去，冷飕飕的北风扑面吹来，但我的心头却激动着暖洋洋的春意。对着面前荒寒草地上的星星点点的黄花，我觉得我就是一个园丁，我正在撒播着花的种籽，我正在浇灌着花的幼芽。在我的眼前，仿佛已出现了百花灿烂的大地，风光明媚的春天。
