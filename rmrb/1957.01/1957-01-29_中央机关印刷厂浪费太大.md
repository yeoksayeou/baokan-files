    Excessive Waste in the Central Authorities Printing Plant

    I am a staff member of the State Construction Commission Printing Plant. From my contact with some printing tasks of the central authorities and the central authorities' printing plant itself, there are very serious phenomena of waste.

    The amount of printing tasks for the central authorities is truly astonishing. Many authorities print a large number of documents for every meeting, and the speeches of each representative are printed as separate pamphlets. Calculating this expense, it is not several thousand or tens of thousands of yuan, but hundreds of thousands of yuan. It is understood that the documents printed for a recent conference held by the Ministry of Urban Construction amounted to as many as six or seven hundred thousand words. The internal publications of the central authorities are also numerous. Because they are not charged, the circulation is very large; some have a very small circulation, even only a few dozen copies, and could originally be mimeographed, but are printed with lead type for the sake of appearance.

    Another characteristic of the central authorities' printing tasks is the urgency required. Some units, in order to get their things printed as early as possible, disregard costs and ask the printing plant to work overtime. The State Planning Commission alone spent more than 50,000 yuan on overtime for the printing plant in 1955, and more than 20,000 yuan in 1956. Some units, in order to save trouble, send drafts that have not been carefully proofread or have not been approved by the leadership to the printing plant for typesetting. After the printing plant typesets them, they are revised again and again, and may even be completely unusable, increasing the typesetting costs.

    Because the central authorities have many forms and reports, many conference documents, many materials, and many publications, everyone hopes to have their own printing plant for convenience. As a result, authorities' printing plants have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. By now, almost every ministry of the central authorities has a printing plant, and each printing plant requires state investment, at least tens of thousands of yuan, and in some cases, up to millions of yuan. With a printing plant, it is necessary to find workers and allocate cadres, and the problems increase day by day.

    Do the central authorities really need so many and such large printing plants? We only need to cite a few examples to illustrate this. The printing tasks undertaken by the Printing Plant of the State Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance (now renamed the Printing Plant of the Finance Publishing House) account for only about 10% of the plant's total tasks, and 90% of the tasks have to be sought from other units; and some printing tasks of the Ministry of Finance and the State Taxation Bureau have to be taken to other printing plants because they are limited by the printing conditions of their own printing plant. The State Construction Commission Printing Plant undertakes the printing tasks of the State Construction Commission, the Economic Commission, and the Planning Commission. Of course, when tasks come, it feels like there are not enough people and overtime is needed, but such things are rare. Most of the time of the year is still spent soliciting business from other units.

    If it is said that each department of the central authorities really needs to set up its own printing plant, then, judging from the above situation, at least unified management is needed to eliminate the phenomenon of uneven workload among the various printing plants.

    In addition, many printing plants of the central authorities do not have state plans; they are self-supporting and do not turn over profits. In recent years, the profits of many printing plants have greatly increased. The State Construction Commission Printing Plant has an annual profit of about 400,000 yuan; the printing plants of the various central authorities together have an annual profit of at least several million yuan. Such a large sum of money is all controlled by the plants themselves, which not only easily leads to waste, but also reduces the state's income.　Liu Yi

### 中央机关印刷厂浪费太大

    中央机关印刷厂浪费太大
    我是国家建设委员会印刷厂的一个工作人员，在我所接触到的一些中央机关的印刷任务中和机关印刷厂本身，都存在着很严重的浪费现象。
    中央机关印刷任务之多，真是惊人。许多机关一开会就大量印文件，各个代表的发言都要印成单行本。这一笔费用计算起来，不是几千元、几万元，而是几十万元。据了解，城市建设部最近召开的一次会议所印的文件就达六、七十万字之多。中央机关的内部刊物也多，因为不收费，发行数量很大；有些发行数量虽很少，甚至只几十份，本来可以油印，但是为了漂亮，也铅印了。
    中央机关印刷任务的另一个特点是要得急。有的单位为了及早印出自己的东西，就不顾成本，叫印刷厂加班加点。仅国家计划委员会，1955年要印刷厂加班加点，就支出费用五万多元，1956年也有二万多元。有的单位为了图省事，把一些没有认真校阅过的稿子或者没有经过领导上批准的稿子，发到印刷厂付排，印刷厂排出来之后，改了再改，甚至根本不能用，增加了排版费。
    因为中央机关的表报多、会议文件多、资料多、刊物多，大家都希望自己有个印刷厂，用着方便，因而机关印刷厂便如雨后春笋。到现在，几乎中央每一个部都有一个印刷厂，每一个印刷厂都需要国家投资，最少也要投资几万元，多的，可以到上百万元。有了印刷厂，就需找工人、配干部，问题也就一天天多起来。
    中央机关是不是需要这么多、这么大的印刷厂呢？我们只要举几个例子就可以说明。财政部税务总局印刷厂（现改为财政出版社印刷厂）所担负的机关印刷任务只占全厂任务10％左右，90％的任务是要找别的单位的；而财政部和税务总局的有些印刷任务，因为受本机关印刷厂印刷条件的限制，还不得不拿到其他印刷厂去。国家建设委员会印刷厂负担着国家建设委员会、经济委员会和计划委员会的印刷任务。固然任务来了，觉得人少，需要加班加点，但这样的事情毕竟是很少的，一年中的大部分时间还是要到其他单位去揽生意。
    假如说，中央各个机关都确实有必要自己设一个印刷厂的话，那么，从上面的情况看来，至少也需要统一管理，消除各个印刷厂之间忙闲不均的现象。
    另外，中央机关的许多印刷厂是没有国家计划的；他们以厂养厂，也没有上缴利润。这几年来，许多印刷厂的利润大大增加，国家建设委员会印刷厂每年约有四十万元利润；中央各个机关的印刷厂加在一起，每年至少有几百万元的利润。这么大的一笔钱，都由各厂自己支配，不但容易造成浪费，而且也减少了国家的收入。　柳毅
