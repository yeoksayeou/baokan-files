    The Master Exposes the Servant

    The U.S. government frequently propagates that its foreign aid is to help other countries develop their economies and has no political intentions. For example, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said that the purpose of U.S. aid "is to help newly independent countries and underdeveloped countries maintain their independence," and that this aid is "without political strings attached," because the United States "does not require others to submit to us." Recently, the "Eisenhower Doctrine" stipulated $400 million in aid to Middle Eastern countries, supposedly to "maintain the economic strength of national independence," and that it "neither wants to politically dominate nor economically dominate" the people of the recipient countries.

    However, this hypocritical face has not only been exposed by the facts, but also by the Americans themselves. After the "Eisenhower Doctrine" was announced, Max Weston Thornburg, a key founder of the "oil empire" of the U.S. monopoly enterprise "New Jersey Standard Oil," wrote an article in "Fortune" magazine. He said: "Everything we do in the Middle East in terms of strategic economics and technology has political consequences. Every one of our aid programs will strengthen one group and its leaders and weaken its competitors." Thornburg advocated that "in the Middle Eastern countries, we should work through the leaders of these countries, starting from the top. We should support those whose goals are in line with ours." Thus, this author particularly enthusiastically praised the policies of Turkey, Iran, and Iraq. At the same time, he believes that the current leaders of Egypt do not meet the needs of U.S. policy and efforts should be made to change the direction of the Egyptian government, and the main goal of U.S. intervention is Egypt.

    These blatant words of Thornburg reflect the strong desire of U.S. monopoly capitalists for the United States to intensify its aggression against the Middle East. It is very common for U.S. monopoly capitalists to appear as masters, issuing orders to their servants like Dulles and his ilk. However, this time Thornburg not only directly stated the true purpose of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," but also inadvertently gave the lying Dulles a powerful slap in the face! (Hou)

    主人揭穿了仆人
    美国政府经常宣传说，它的对外援助是为了帮助别的国家发展经济，而没有政治企图。例如，美国国务卿杜勒斯说过，美国援助的目的“在于帮助新近独立的国家和不发达的国家维护他们的独立”，这种援助是“没有政治牵连威胁的”，因为美国“不要求人家屈从我们”。最近，“艾森豪威尔主义”规定援助中东国家四亿美元，据说也是为了“维持民族独立的经济力量”，而对受援国家的人民“既不想在政治上进行统治，也不想在经济上进行统治”。
    但是，这种伪善面目不仅被事实所揭穿，而且也被美国人自己揭穿了。在“艾森豪威尔主义”宣布后，美国垄断企业“新泽西美孚油公司”的“石油帝国”的主要创始人马克斯·威斯吞·汤勃格在“幸福”杂志上写了一篇文章。他说：“我们在战略经济和技术方面对中东所作的一切都有政治后果。我们的每一个援助计划都将加强某一集团及其领导人而削弱其竞争者。”汤勃格主张，“在中东各国，我们应该通过各国领导人干事情，应该从上层开始。应该支持目标同我们相符的人。”于是，这个作者就特别热烈地赞扬土耳其、伊朗和伊拉克的政策。同时他认为埃及目前的领导人不符合美国政策需要，应该努力改变埃及政府的方针，而美国干涉的主要目标就是埃及。
    汤勃格这些露骨的话，反映了美国垄断资本家要求美国加紧侵略中东的强烈欲望。美国垄断资本家以主人的身份出现，向他们的仆人杜勒斯之流发号施令，这是非常普通的事。可是，这一次汤勃格却不仅直接了当地说出了“艾森豪威尔主义”的真正目的，并且无意中给说谎的杜勒斯一记有力的耳光！　（厚）
