Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 13th: Sichuan Province farmers, having achieved a bumper harvest, will conduct Spring Festival cultural activities this year in accordance with the principles of thrift.

    The backbone members of cultural activities trained by various counties have now returned to the countryside one after another. In Guangyuan, Santai and other eleven counties alone, there are more than 2,700 trained backbone members of cultural activities. During their training, the cultural backbones in Guangyuan and other counties specifically discussed how to utilize existing equipment and conduct Spring Festival cultural activities according to the principles of thrift. The Provincial Culture Bureau and the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles have printed twenty kinds of Spring Festival entertainment and singing materials including content such as increasing production and practicing thrift.

    Currently, many rural clubs have already begun rehearsing new programs. During the Spring Festival, many agricultural cooperatives will hold joint celebrations and visits with towns, industrial and mining enterprises, and military units. Yanting and other counties are also preparing to organize a group of amateur touring performance teams to carry out literary and art propaganda centered on increasing production and practicing thrift, and building the country with diligence and frugality in market towns and rural areas.

    At the end of last year, the Sichuan Provincial Culture Bureau issued a notice requiring all regions to pay attention to thrift in Spring Festival cultural activities, and to strive to spend less money or no money at all.

    利用原有设备　根据节约原则
    四川各地安排春节文艺活动
    新华社成都13日电　获得丰收的四川省农民，今年将根据节约原则开展春节文艺活动。
    各县训练的文艺活动骨干分子，现在已经陆续回到农村。仅广元、三台等十一个县受过训练的文艺活动骨干分子，就有两千七百多人。广元等县的文艺骨干在学习中，专门讨论了利用原有设备根据节约原则开展春节文艺活动的问题。省文化局和省文联已经印发了包括增产节约等内容的春节文娱演唱材料二十种。
    现在，许多农村俱乐部都已经开始排练新节目了。春节期间，许多农业社将和城镇、工矿、部队进行联欢、访问。盐亭等县还准备组织一批业余巡回演出队，在集镇和农村进行以增产节约、勤俭建国为中心的文艺宣传。
    去年年底，四川省文化局曾发出通知，要求各地在春节文艺活动中注意节约，尽可能做到少花钱或不花钱。
