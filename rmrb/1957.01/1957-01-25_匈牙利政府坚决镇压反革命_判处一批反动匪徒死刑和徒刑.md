Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 24th: TASS reports: The Budapest Military Court recently tried a gang of counter-revolutionaries headed by Yo. Valga, sentencing three of them to death and four to prison terms ranging from five to ten years. The charges against this gang of counter-revolutionaries were carrying out activities against the people's democratic regime and illegally hiding weapons and ammunition.

The ringleader of this bandit gang, Valga, had been tried by the court three times for illegal activities. He was one of the leaders of a counter-revolutionary organization called the "National Guard" in a certain region and participated in the rebellion against the people's democratic regime during the Hungarian events. At the beginning of this year, Valga and his accomplices secretly gathered again, attempting to seize the radio station, Krut Street, the main street of Budapest, and the bridges over the Danube River, and also attempted to incite strikes in Hungary. This group of counter-revolutionary bandits also possessed a large number of weapons.

    匈牙利政府坚决镇压反革命
    判处一批反动匪徒死刑和徒刑
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：布达佩斯军事法庭最近审讯了以约·瓦尔加为首的一帮反革命分子，判处其中三人死刑、四人五年到十年的徒刑。这帮反革命分子的罪名是进行反对人民民主政权的活动和非法隐藏武器弹药。
    这个匪帮的头子瓦尔加因进行非法活动曾三次受到法庭审讯。他是某地区所谓“国家近卫军”的反革命组织的领导人之一，在匈牙利事件期间曾参加反对人民民主政权的叛乱。今年年初，瓦尔加又同他的同谋者秘密聚会，企图伺机占领广播电台、布达佩斯的主要街道克鲁特街和多瑙河上的桥梁，并且还企图在匈牙利煽动罢工。这批反革命匪徒还拥有大量武器。
