Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 13th. Premier Zhou Enlai met with over three thousand people from all walks of life in Warsaw at the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw at 4:00 PM on the 12th.

　　The magnificent hall was already packed with attendees. When they saw Premier Zhou Enlai accompanied by Comrades Gomulka, Zawadzki, Cyrankiewicz, and others walking onto the stage, they all stood up and applauded warmly.

　　Also seated on the stage were members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Ignar, Chairman of the Polish United Peasants' Party, and Kulczyński, Chairman of the Polish Democratic Party, among others.

　　No pillars in the hall obstructed people's view. From every seat, they could see the Chinese guests and the leaders of the Polish United Workers' Party and the state seated on the stage, as well as a profound and simply composed painting on the stage: two huge and powerful hands stretching out from the five-star red flag of China and the red and white national flag of Poland, clasped tightly together; behind this was an image symbolizing socialist industrialization.

　　The chairman of the meeting, Dworakowski, Chairman of the Presidium of the Warsaw People's Council, delivered a speech first. On behalf of the citizens of Warsaw, the Warsaw People's Council, and the Presidium of the People's Council, he expressed a warm and heartfelt welcome to the Chinese guests.

　　Next, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Poland, Cyrankiewicz, delivered a speech. (For a summary of the speech, see the second page.)

　　Premier Zhou Enlai stepped onto the podium amidst a burst of warm applause and delivered a long speech. His speech repeatedly won stormy applause from the attendees. After Premier Zhou's speech ended, someone shouted from their seat: "Long live the People's China!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" (For the full text of the speech, see the second page.)

　　Then, everyone stood up and sang the Internationale.

　　After the meeting, a cultural performance was held. The program included Chinese dances and Chinese songs performed by Polish artists.

    华沙人民集会欢迎周总理
    新华社华沙13日电　周恩来总理12日下午四时在华沙文化科学宫会议大厅里同华沙市各界人民三千多人会见。
    这个金碧辉煌的大厅早就挤满了与会的群众。他们在看到周恩来总理由哥穆尔卡、萨瓦茨基、西伦凯维兹等同志陪伴走上主席台时，都起立热烈鼓掌。
    在大会主席台上就座的还有波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局的委员们，波兰统一农民党主席伊格纳尔和波兰民主党主席库耳钦斯基等。
    大厅中没有一根柱子妨碍人们的视线。他们从每个座位上都可以看到主席台上坐着的中国客人和波兰统一工人党和国家领导人员，以及台上设置的一幅意义深刻而构图简明的画幅：从中国的五星红旗和波兰的红白色国旗中伸出的巨大而有力的两只手紧紧地握在一起；在这后面是象征着社会主义工业化的图景。
    大会主席、华沙市人民会议主席团主席德沃拉科夫斯基首先致词。他代表华沙市民、华沙人民会议和人民会议主席团对中国客人们表示了热烈的衷心的欢迎。
    接着，波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹发表了演说。（演说摘要见第二版）
    周恩来总理在一阵热烈的掌声中走上讲台，发表了长篇演说。他的演说不时博得了到会者的暴风雨般的掌声。周总理演说结束以后，有人从座位上高呼：“人民中国万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”（演说全文见第二版）
    接着，全体起立高唱国际歌。
    会后举行了文艺演出。演出的节目中包括有波兰艺术家们表演的中国舞蹈和中国歌曲。
