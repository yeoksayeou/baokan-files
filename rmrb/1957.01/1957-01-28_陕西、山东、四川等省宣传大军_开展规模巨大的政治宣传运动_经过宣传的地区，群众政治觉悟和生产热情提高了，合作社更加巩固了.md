A propaganda army of approximately one million people in Shaanxi Province is conducting a massive political propaganda campaign among the broad masses of farmers.

Local areas have provided short-term training to cadres, middle school students, Party reporters, propagandists, and demobilized soldiers participating in this propaganda army. They have also formulated propaganda outlines including the current situation, the superiority of agricultural collectivization, the development of the great production movement, and the promotion of the tradition of hard work and plain living. In the propaganda activities, various methods were adopted, such as holding commune members' meetings, small-scale seminars, door-to-door visits, and get-togethers. Full use was made of rural clubs, wired broadcasts, county newspapers, and blackboard newspapers to ensure that every commune member received education. In addition to personally giving reports to grassroots cadres and commune members, members of the prefectural and county party committees also made door-to-door visits and had heart-to-heart talks with commune members. Some places, such as the counties in the Shangluo area, also specifically requested that personnel participating in the propaganda work humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, so that the content of the propaganda would be in line with the actual situation of the local area.

During this propaganda campaign, all localities paid attention to propaganda in mountainous areas. This was another extensive visit to mountainous areas after the visit to mountainous areas last autumn. The masses in the mountainous areas traversed by the propagandists were filled with joy. Some people in the mountainous areas of the Hanzhong area originally thought that the mountainous area was bitter and not as good as the plains, and asked to go down the mountain. After the propaganda, these ideas were dispelled, and they realized that the mountainous area is a part of the motherland, and a large part of the resources needed for the construction of the motherland are supplied by the mountainous area, and they strengthened their determination to build the mountainous area for a long time. The masses in the mountainous areas are more actively participating in winter sideline production. In the mountainous area of ​​Ankang area, some agricultural cooperatives reduced production last year due to drought. Now these cooperatives that have reduced production have been compensated from winter sideline production. As a result of the development of sideline production in some cooperatives, the income of commune members has reached or exceeded the level of the previous year.

New atmospheres have emerged in areas where propaganda activities have been carried out. Agricultural cooperatives have been further consolidated. At present, whether in bumper harvest areas, mountainous areas, or individual areas with reduced production, there is generally no phenomenon of the masses requesting to withdraw from the cooperatives, and the attendance rate of commune members has also increased. According to the secretary of the Dali County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, 80% of the commune members in the county have been educated, the awareness of the masses has been improved, and the cooperatives have been unprecedentedly consolidated. The director of the office of the Wugong County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party said that after the propaganda, the masses were in high spirits, and more than 90% of the wheat fields in the county had been fertilized, and many wheat fields had been fertilized twice, and all the irrigable wheat fields had been winter irrigated. Luonan County in Shangluo Prefecture has completed more soil and water conservation work since last winter than in the past few years. Other tasks such as accumulating fertilizer, winter irrigation, and sideline production have also exceeded last year's achievements.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 26th: Socialist propaganda activities have been launched in vast areas of Shandong.

From the 20th to the 25th, responsible cadres of the Shandong Province and Jinan City Party and government departments have made hundreds of reports to factories, enterprises, schools, hospitals, handicraft cooperatives, and street residents' organizations in Jinan City, with more than 100,000 listeners. More than 40,000 teachers, students, and staff members of more than 40 large and middle schools in Jinan City and more than 2,000 primary school teachers in the city listened to the reports. In addition to explaining the current international and domestic situation, the reporters focused on the great achievements my country has made in socialist construction and socialist transformation in 1956, and the current temporary shortcomings and problems in agricultural collectivization and non-staple food supply and the reasons for their emergence were explained and analyzed in detail. After listening to the report, the 29 workers in the first group of the second workshop of the Jinan No. 3 Cotton Mill, a joint state-private enterprise, put forward three guarantees: 1. Be at ease with production before the Spring Festival; 2. Strengthen unity with farmers when going home for the Spring Festival, respect agricultural cooperative cadres, and buy less New Year's goods to save money for the Spring Festival; 3. Return to the factory on time without delaying production.

More than 50 members of the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Municipal Committee, and municipal propagandists were dispatched to report to the masses in the city. Xue Muqiao, director of the State Statistical Bureau, who is in Qingdao, was also invited by the local government to report to cadres of municipal organs on agricultural collectivization and the free market.

The Party and government departments of each prefecture and county have successively formulated plans for carrying out propaganda activities in rural areas during the Spring Festival. The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also instructed more than 500 cadres of provincial-level organs working in rural areas to carry out propaganda to the local masses. The Qihe County Committee of the Communist Party of China will organize all county and district reporters to go to rural areas to make reports during the Spring Festival, and also prepare to dispatch cadres from county-level organs to form three propaganda teams, carrying radios, pictures and other propaganda tools to conduct roving propaganda in rural areas. Many middle school students in Linyi County said after listening to the report that they would study with peace of mind and help their families actively embark on the road of collectivization.

Xinhua News Agency: A massive propaganda movement is being widely launched in Sichuan Province. Twenty-eight department and bureau-level cadres and university presidents organized by the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China are giving current affairs reports to organs, schools, and factories in Chengdu. The propaganda in rural areas is no less than the scale of the propaganda of the general line in 1953. The propaganda army organized by the Yibin Prefectural Committee reached 180,000 people. More than 260 reporters from the county, district, and township of Shehong County have made two or three reports to the masses. Wu Lu Township also organized more than 240 broadcast tubes and other propaganda tools to carry out propaganda on the achievements of collectivization and increased production and conservation during the farmers' field breaks. After the propaganda, the enthusiasm of the masses was high, and the Fourth Cooperative of Wu'an Township built a drainage ditch of more than 300 feet in a few days. A land processing and fertilizer accumulation craze has been set off throughout the county.

    陕西、山东、四川等省宣传大军
    开展规模巨大的政治宣传运动
    经过宣传的地区，群众政治觉悟和生产热情提高了，合作社更加巩固了
    本报讯　陕西省一支拥有约一百万人的宣传大军，正在向广大农民进行一次规模巨大的政治宣传运动。
    各地对于参加这支宣传大军的干部、中学生，党的报告员、宣传员和复员军人等，进行了短期训练；还拟定了包括目前形势、农业合作化优越性、开展大生产运动、发扬艰苦朴素传统等内容的宣传提纲。在宣传活动中，采取了多种多样的方式，如召开社员大会、小型座谈会、挨户访问和联欢等，并充分运用农村俱乐部、有线广播、县报和黑板报等宣传工具，争取每个社员都能够受到一次教育。地委、县委委员除了亲自向基层干部和社员作报告外，还要逐户访问，和社员谈心。有些地方例如商雒专区各县，还特别要求参加宣传工作的人员，虚心听取群众意见，使宣传的内容切合当地的实际情况。
    在这次宣传活动中，各地都注意了对山区的宣传。这是在去年秋季访问山区后，又一次广泛访问山区的活动。宣传人员所走过的山区，群众内心都洋溢着一片欢乐的情绪。汉中地区的山区群众，有些人本来认为山区苦，不如平川，要求下山。经过宣传后，这些想法打消了，他们认识到山区是祖国的一部分，祖国建设中所需要的很大一部分资源是由山区供应的，坚定了长期建设山区的决心。山区群众参加冬季副业生产更加积极了。安康专区的山区，去年由于天旱，有些农业社减了产，现在这些减产的社，都从冬季副业生产中得到了补偿。有些社开展副业生产的结果，社员收入都达到或超过了前年的水平。
    经过宣传活动的地区，都出现了新的气象。农业合作社更加巩固了。目前，不管是在丰收区，或者是山区和个别减产区，一般地都没有群众要求退社的现象，社员的出勤率也提高了。据中共大荔县委书记说，全县已有80％的社员受到了教育，群众觉悟提高了，合作社也空前的巩固了。中共武功县委办公室主任说，经过宣传，群众情绪很高，全县90％以上的麦田已经施了肥，有很多麦田还施过两次肥，能浇灌的麦田已经全部完成了冬灌。商雒专区的雒南县，从去冬以来完成的水土保持工作比过去几年的成绩还大。其它如积肥、冬灌、副业生产等也都超过了去年的成绩。
    新华社济南26日电　社会主义宣传活动已在山东广大地区开展起来了。
    从20日到25日，山东省和济南市党、政部门的负责干部，已向济南市的工厂、企业、学校、医院、手工业合作社以及街道居民组织，作了上百次报告，听众在十万人以上。济南市的四十多个大中学校的师生员工四万多人和全市小学教师二千多人都听了报告。报告人除说明了当前国际和国内的形势外，并着重说明了1956年我国在社会主义建设和社会主义改造中，所获得的巨大成就，并对当前在农业合作化、副食品供应方面存在的暂时的缺点与问题及其产生的原因，作了详细的说明与分析。公私合营济南第三织布厂第二车间第一组的二十九个工人在听了报告后，提出三条保证：一、春节前安心生产；二、春节回家要加强与农民的团结、尊重农业社干部，并且要少买年货回家，以节俭过春节；三、按时回厂，不误生产。
    中共青岛市委书记、市委会和市级宣传员共五十多人，都出动向全市广大群众作报告。正在青岛市的国家统计局局长薛暮桥也应当地政府邀请，就农业合作化和自由市场问题向市级机关干部作了报告。
    各专区和县的党政部门都先后制定了春节期间在农村开展宣传活动的计划。中共山东省委也指示正在农村工作的五百多个省级机关的干部向当地群众进行宣传。中共齐河县委将在春节期间组织县、区所有报告员分赴农村作报告，还准备抽调县级机关干部组成三个宣传队，携带收音机、图片等宣传工具分赴农村巡回宣传。临沂县的许多中学生听了报告以后，表示要安心学习，并且帮助家庭积极走合作化道路。
    本报讯　四川省声势浩大的宣传运动正普遍展开。中共四川省委组织的二十八个厅、局长级干部和大学校长，正向成都各机关、学校、工厂作时事报告。农村的宣传也不亚于1953年宣传总路线时的规模。宜宾地委组织的宣传大军达十八万人。射洪县县、区、乡二百六十多个报告员已向群众作了两、三次报告。武陆乡还组织了二百四十多个广播筒等宣传工具，利用农民田间休息时间，进行合作化成就和增产节约的宣传。经过宣传后，群众情绪高涨，武安乡四社几天就修了条三百多丈的排洪沟。全县已掀起了土地加工和积肥热潮。
