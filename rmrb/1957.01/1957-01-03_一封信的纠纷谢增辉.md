    A Letter's Dispute
    Xie Zenghui
    Director Huang, in the telephone room, glanced at a registered letter on the communications clerk Xiao Zhang's desk, written in calligraphy and addressed to Comrade ×× of the CCP Central Committee.
    "Don't send it yet, I want to talk to him!"
    The director left the telephone room and immediately called Lao Xie into his office.
    "Our organization is about to change, do you have any opinions?"
    "No opinions."
    "No opinions?" The director's expression and tone seemed a bit surprised, but he still tried to restrain his emotions and said, "Why did you write a letter to the Central Committee?"
    Before Lao Xie could speak, he raised a series of questions: "What is your relationship with Comrade ××? Are you relatives? Are you friends? Are you..."
    "No relationship."
    "If you have no relationship, why did you write a letter to him?"
    "The Constitution doesn't stipulate that ordinary citizens cannot write letters to central leaders, does it?"
    The director was silent for a moment, and then said intermittently, "Hmm! ... Hmm! ... Anyway, writing letters to the Central Committee must be done through the organization, through the leadership, that's the system here. Did you write the letter through the leadership and the organization? You need to know that this approach of yours is accusing the leadership, isn't it?"
    "I don't think it's a big deal to write a letter to the Central Committee in a personal capacity."
    The director's temper seemed to flare up again, and he said, "Anyway, as long as you're in my unit, writing a letter to the Central Committee is accusing me!"
    "......"
    He suddenly realized that he had said something a bit excessive, so he switched to a tone of persuasion and said, "I hope you'll still consider whether it's better to send that letter or not."
    The conversation ended there. The letter was eventually sent. From then on, Director Huang paid extra attention to Lao Xie in all aspects, especially writing letters, but he didn't know if he discovered anything else later.

    一封信的纠纷
    谢增辉
    黄局长在电话室里，一眼扫见通讯员小张桌上放着一封用毛笔写的给中共中央××同志的挂号信。
    “不忙发，我要同他谈一下！”
    局长走出电话室，马上把老谢叫进他的办公室去。
    “我们这个机构要变动了，你有什么意见吗？”
    “没什么意见。”
    “没意见？”局长的神情和语气好像有点诧异，但仍然尽量克制自己的感情说：“你为什么向中央写信？”
    还没等老谢开腔，他又提出一连串的问题：“你跟××同志是什么关系？是亲戚吗？是朋友吗？是……”
    “没什么关系。”
    “没什么关系，你为什么要给他写信呢？”
    “宪法上并没有规定普通公民不能跟中央的领导人写信吧。”
    局长沉默了一下，又断断续续地说：“嗯！……嗯！……反正，给中央写信要事先通过组织，通过领导，这是我们这儿的制度。你写信通过领导和组织吗？要知道，你这种作法不是在控告领导吗？”
     “我认为，以私人名义向中央写信并不是什么了不起的事情。”
    局长的火气好像又上来了，说道：“反正，你在我这个单位，你向中央写信就是控告我！”
    “……。”
    他忽然想到说得有点过火，就转用劝告的口气说：“我希望你还是考虑考虑，那封信是发好，不发好。”
    谈话就到这里结束。信终究是发出去了。从此以后，老谢的各方面，特别是写信，黄局长都加倍地注意，不过他后来是否又发现了什么，就不知道了。
