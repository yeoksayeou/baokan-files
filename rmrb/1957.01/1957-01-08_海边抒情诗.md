    Seaside Lyrical Poem
    Li Ying
    The red buoy lights on the sea are like clusters of green, plump leaves, and the red buoy light is like a peony that never fades. It stands forever, braving the boundless wind and rain, speaking a silent language. It tells the secrets of the sea to travelers, allowing ships to bypass reefs and shallows; you guard your post like a soldier, you give remote instructions like a mother. Oh, your heart is as hot and red as the rising sun, your eyes are deeply affectionate and wise—in the endless depths and distances of the sea and sky, you give strength and courage to so many people. The sea is like a cluster of green, plump leaves, and the red buoy light is like a peony that never fades. The more violent the wind and rain in the dark night, the more brilliantly your flower of life blooms.
    On the signal platform, on the tops of palm trees, in the sky, a thousand stars twinkle brightly. The deep and cold night sky is the sea, the clouds are islands, the stars are mast lights; I stand on the white signal platform, watching ships sailing towards me from all directions. They send signals as they go, their sails filled with the wind of joy. Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! I answered them with lights, I gave them safe anchorage with lights, I gave them the love of soldiers with lights.
            October 1956, Yulin Port

    海边抒情诗
    李瑛
    红标灯海像一簇簇绿色肥大的叶子，红标灯像一朵开不败的牡丹，一任无际的风劈雨砍，永远伫立，说着无声的语言。把海水的秘密告诉远行人，使船只绕过暗礁、浅滩；你坚守岗位像战士，你遥遥叮嘱像母亲。你滚热的赤如朝日的心呵，你深情的聪明的眼——在海天无尽的深处、远处，给多少人增加力量和勇敢。海像一簇簇绿色肥大的叶子，红标灯像一朵开不败的牡丹，越是在风狂雨暴的暗夜里，你的生命之花越开得灿烂。
    在信号台上在棕榈树梢，在天空，一千颗星星莹莹闪动，又深又冷的夜空是大海呀，云块是岛、星是桅灯；我站在白色的信号台上，望着四方的船向我航行，它们一边走一边打着讯号，船帆里载满快乐的风。欢迎呵！欢迎呵！欢迎呵！我用灯光回答了他们，我用灯光给了他们安全的锚位，我用灯光给了他们士兵的爱情。
