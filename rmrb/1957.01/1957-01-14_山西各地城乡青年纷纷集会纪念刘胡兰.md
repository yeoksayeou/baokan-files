Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, January 12th: In Shanxi Province, vast numbers of youth in both urban and rural areas gathered on the 11th and 12th to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the death of revolutionary heroine Liu Hulan.

Memorial meetings were held in five cities, including Taiyuan, Datong, and Yuci, as well as many county towns and market towns. Youths from factories, mines, schools, and government organizations in these towns, along with rural youth, also shared their thoughts and feelings after studying Liu Hulan's life and deeds at discussion groups, storytelling sessions, thematic meetings, and recitation gatherings. At its commemorative meeting, the Yangquan Mining Bureau commended twenty-two advanced collective units and five hundred and seventy advanced workers. Over eight hundred cadres from six counties, including Hejin, were sent to rural areas to introduce Liu Hulan's life and deeds to young farmers. In addition to holding joint student commemorative meetings in various market towns, Heshun and Pingshun counties also opened a Liu Hulan Tenth Anniversary Memorial Hall in the county seat, attracting many visitors.

At the League membership oath ceremony held on the evening of the 11th, one hundred and fifteen young people at the Taiyuan Paper Mill stated that in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, they would learn from Liu Hulan's revolutionary spirit of loving the motherland and save more raw materials. On the 12th, workers at the "Youth Furnace" of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's steelmaking department produced more than ten tons of high-quality steel beyond the original plan. They also proposed using the practical action of producing five hundred tons more steel than originally planned in January to commemorate the martyr Liu Hulan. On the 12th, the Du Yumei group at the Taiyuan Jinsheng Textile Factory also exceeded their daily production quota, setting a new daily production record for the group this year.

Many young people throughout the province listened to the special program commemorating the tenth anniversary of Liu Hulan's death, broadcast by Shanxi People's Radio Station from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM on the 12th.
