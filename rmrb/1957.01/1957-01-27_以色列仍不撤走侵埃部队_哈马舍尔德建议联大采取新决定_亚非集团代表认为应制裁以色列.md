Xinhua News Agency, January 26th: UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld reported to the United Nations General Assembly on the 25th that Israel had not fully complied with the General Assembly's demand that Israeli troops completely withdraw from Egypt by midnight on the 24th. Hammarskjöld's report was submitted in accordance with a proposal put forward by the Asian-African group of countries, which was adopted by the General Assembly on the 19th. That proposal requested the Secretary-General to submit a report within five days on whether Israel had completely withdrawn its troops from Egyptian territory.

    Along with the report, Hammarskjöld submitted to the General Assembly a memorandum given to him by Israel. In the memorandum, Israel unreasonably insisted that its troops should continue to be stationed in the Gaza and Aqaba Gulf regions, and also demanded the establishment of an Israeli civil administration in the Gaza Strip.

    Hammarskjöld said that Israel's demands meant changing the situation created by the 1949 Armistice Agreement. The United Nations cannot tolerate changes in the situation caused by military actions that violate the Charter and must insist on the withdrawal of Israeli troops. Regarding the Gaza Strip, he said that the 1949 Armistice Agreement must be fully complied with. The United Nations cannot agree to Israel controlling this area, even if such control is non-military in nature.

    Hammarskjöld also said that the United Nations Emergency Force is not authorized to expand its power in the Gaza region. He said: if the United Nations forces are deployed in Gaza, the basis for this deployment must be the same as the basis for its deployment on the ceasefire line in the Sinai Peninsula. “If it is to expand its power in this region, it must obtain Egypt's consent." He said that even expanding administrative powers must obtain Egypt's consent.

    Hammarskjöld believes that the United Nations forces should not only be sent to the Gaza region, but also to the Israeli side of the Auja ceasefire line. He hopes that the United Nations General Assembly can make a new decision on this point and obtain the consent of the parties concerned.

    Hammarskjöld also mentioned that the Egyptian government had notified him, expressing that "the Egyptian government hopes to stop all attacks and intrusions from both sides of the ceasefire line, and hopes that the United Nations auxiliary agencies will provide effective assistance in this regard."

    The United Nations General Assembly will discuss Hammarskjöld's report on the 28th.

    Xinhua News Agency, January 26th: New York News: Representatives of the Asian-African group of countries at the United Nations believe that if Israel refuses to immediately withdraw its troops from the Gaza and Aqaba Gulf regions, the Asian-African group should immediately request the United Nations to impose sanctions on Israel.

    This news was released after a meeting held by representatives of the Asian-African group of countries on the 25th. At the meeting, representatives of these countries consulted on the discussion to be held by the General Assembly on the 28th regarding the issue of Israel's withdrawal of troops from Egyptian territory.

    Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi reiterated at the meeting of the Asian-African group of countries Egypt's position that Israeli troops should withdraw from Egyptian territory unconditionally, and explained Egypt's attitude towards the report submitted by UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on this issue.

    以色列仍不撤走侵埃部队
    哈马舍尔德建议联大采取新决定
    亚非集团代表认为应制裁以色列
    新华社26日讯　联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德25日向联合国大会报告说，以色列还没有完全遵从大会要以色列军队在24日午夜以前全部撤出埃及的要求。哈马舍尔德的报告是根据大会19日通过的亚非集团国家的一项提案提出的。那项提案要求秘书长以五天为限，提出以色列是否把它的军队全部撤出埃及领土的报告。
    哈马舍尔德随同报告向大会提出了以色列交给他的一项备忘录。以色列在备忘录中无理坚持它的军队要继续驻在加沙和亚喀巴湾地区，并且还要求在加沙地带建立一个以色列的民政机构。
    哈马舍尔德说，以色列的要求意味着改变1949年停战协定所创立的局面。联合国不能容忍违反宪章的军事行动所造成的局面的改变，并且必须坚持撤退以色列军队。他说，关于加沙地带，1949年的停战协定必须充分得到遵守。联合国不能同意以色列控制这个地区，即使这种控制是非军事性质的。
    哈马舍尔德还说，联合国紧急部队也无权在加沙地区扩大权力，他说：如果联合国部队在加沙进行部署，这种部署的根据必须同它在西奈半岛停战线的部署的根据相同，“如果要扩大它在这个地区的权力，必须获得埃及的同意”。他说，即使是扩大管理性职权，也必须获得埃及同意。
    哈马舍尔德认为联合国部队不仅应当派到加沙地区去，而且也应当派到奥贾停战线的以色列那一边去，他希望联合国大会能够在这一点上作出一个新的决定，并且获得有关双方的同意。
    哈马舍尔德还提到，埃及政府已经通知他，表示“埃及政府希望停止所有来自停战线两方面的袭击和侵入，并希望联合国的辅助机构对这一点提供有效的帮助”。
    联合国大会将在28日讨论哈马舍尔德的报告。
    新华社26日讯　纽约消息：联合国亚非集团国家的代表认为，如果以色列拒绝立即从加沙和亚喀巴湾地区撤退军队，亚非集团应当立即要求联合国对以色列加以制裁。
    这个消息是在亚非集团国家代表在25日举行的一次会议以后传出的。这些国家的代表在会议上就大会将在28日举行的关于以色列从埃及领土撤退军队问题的讨论进行了咨商。
    埃及外交部长法齐在亚非集团国家的会议上，重申了埃及主张以色列军队无条件撤出埃及领土的立场，并且说明了埃及对联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德就这个问题提出的报告的态度。
