Xinhua News Agency, 6th: Last year, Beijing eliminated illiteracy for over 51,800 people among workers, government employees, farmers, handicraft workers, and street residents. This number is more than the total number of people who became literate in 1954 and 1955 combined. Since liberation, Beijing has eliminated illiteracy for a total of 177,000 people. Currently, some factories and rural areas are basically free of illiteracy.

After gaining basic literacy, the broad masses of working people have found it easier to manage their daily lives. Many workers can now fill out production reports and shift handover records themselves, read newspapers, set production plans, and write suggestions for rationalization. Farmers and handicraft workers can write notes and fill out labor manuals after becoming literate. The cultural life of some townships and cooperatives has also become more active. More than a dozen members of the Eighth Cotton Textile Production Cooperative who were originally illiterate have subscribed to newspapers. Many farmers go to rural libraries to borrow books and periodicals. In the past, actors in the amateur theater troupe of Nan'anhe Village had to recite lines orally when rehearsing plays. Now, each person has a script in hand, and they can rehearse. Many housewives can also keep household accounts and communicate with relatives.

The importance attached to literacy work by the leadership of many units is one of the important reasons for achieving the above results. All units under the Beijing Municipal Road Engineering Bureau have made comprehensive arrangements for workers' learning plans, learning time, and teaching staff. Many townships, cooperatives, and production teams in the suburbs have planned, arranged, and inspected literacy work and have also assigned dedicated personnel to be responsible. The councils of some handicraft cooperatives often discuss literacy work.

    北京去年扫除文盲五万多人
    新华社6日讯　北京市去年在职工、机关工作人员、农民、手工业者和街道居民中扫除文盲五万一千八百多人。这个数字比1954年和1955年两年扫除文盲的人数还多。北京市从解放以来到现在，一共扫除文盲十七万七千人，目前已经有一些工厂和农村基本上没有文盲了。
    广大的劳动人民获得了初步的读写能力以后，为他们的日常生活提供了便利条件。许多职工能够自己填写生产表报和交接班记录，能够看报纸，订生产计划，写合理化建议书。农民和手工业者识了字以后能够开便条，填写劳动手册。一些乡、社的文化生活也随之活跃起来。第八棉织生产合作社有十几个原来是文盲的社员订了报纸。许多农民到农村图书室去借阅书刊。南安河村的业余剧团的演员们过去排戏要口授台词，现在一人手里拿着一个剧本，就可以排演了。许多家庭妇女也能够记日用账，和亲人通信了。
    许多单位的领导上对扫盲工作的重视，是获得上述成绩的重要原因之一。北京市道路工程局所属各单位，对职工学习的计划、学习时间、教师力量都作了全面的安排。郊区许多乡、社和生产队，对扫盲工作作到了有计划、有安排、有检查，还确定了专人负责。有些手工业社的理事会经常讨论扫盲工作。
