    At the Warsaw Mass Rally
    Speech by Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz (Abstract)
    Poland has consistently supported China's demand for the restoration of its rights in the United Nations and the unification of Taiwan with the motherland. The cooperation between Poland and China is concrete, comprehensive, and constantly increasing.
    The Polish-Soviet Joint Declaration has strengthened the unity between socialist countries, elevating it to a higher level.
    The Polish people regard the visit of Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese government delegation as a very important political event. This is because we all fully understand the role played by People's China, a large socialist country with a large population and vast resources, in the overall international balance of power.
    In the short period since the birth of People's China, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have made tremendous achievements in socialist construction. This is no easy feat, considering the legacy of centuries of backwardness. China has achieved great success in domestic development and in its foreign policy, winning great prestige in Asian countries and around the world. This is also of great significance for the future national liberation struggles of other countries.
    The attempts by imperialist forces to obstruct the struggle of the people of all countries to strive for freedom and independence are futile. Due to the current characteristic of the international stage where the strength of socialism is constantly growing in dominance, and considering the firm will of the exploited and oppressed people of all countries to wage struggles, the complete collapse of the colonial system is only a matter of time. This has already been confirmed by the serious failure of the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt, which is one of the biggest failures of colonialism in this century.
    The efforts of the colonialists will be in vain, even if they, as they are doing now, express their greedy intentions with the voices of nightingales and attach the name of anti-colonialism to these intentions.
    We are confident that the parties concerned will make a sober assessment of this situation, and the plans to gild colonialism will be abandoned. The growing political activism of the people who are accustomed to being treated as targets and places of exploitation by imperialists, and their increasing national consciousness, will certainly help to achieve this goal.
    As has been solemnly emphasized on many occasions, the relations between the People's Republic of Poland and the People's Republic of China are developing smoothly despite the geographical distance.
    People's Poland has consistently and resolutely supported the right of People's China to demand recognition of its rightful place in the United Nations organization. We support this demand because, how long can we continue to refuse to allow the representatives of 600 million people to express their opinions on the United Nations platform, and refuse to allow them to participate in the work of an organization that aims to consolidate peace? In our opinion, it seems that this cannot continue any longer. We believe that granting the People's Republic of China its legitimate status in the United Nations is essential for the Chinese people, but even more essential for the United Nations organization, only in this way can it become a truly effective tool for realizing the tasks stipulated at the time of its establishment.
    We have also consistently and resolutely supported the demand of the People's Republic of China and the entire Chinese people to unify Taiwan with the motherland.
    The Polish people admire and sympathize with the flexible and wise policies of the People's Republic of China, a policy developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
    It should be said that as far as cooperation between Poland and China is concerned, our cooperation is not limited to holding good wishes for each other, but is a concrete, comprehensive, and increasingly enhanced cooperation. This involves political issues, as well as economic and cultural relations. Poland and People's China belong to the big family of socialist countries. The unity, consistency, mutual assistance, and exchange of experiences among socialist countries are the basis for the further development of our countries, the possibility of further achievements in socialism, and the progress of the whole world.
    To a large extent, this also relies on us setting a good example. Our socialist construction should provide this example to the working class around the world in terms of economic, political, and social relations (they must also understand that our people began to build socialism under very unfavorable economic conditions), and to the working classes of those countries that were previously obstructed by annexationists, colonialists, imperialists, and capitalists from achieving the same development as other countries. The masses of people who have seized power and started to build socialism have already won this possibility of development.
    The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union opened a new era for the relations between socialist countries and the future of the international workers' movement. While jointly eliminating the deviations that occurred in the previous period, we are strengthening rather than weakening the unity between socialist countries, we are raising it to a higher level, and we are indisputably strengthening it. For example, the Polish-Soviet Joint Declaration in November of last year provided evidence for this. Establishing relations between socialist countries based on the principles of respect for sovereignty and equal rights, as emphasized in the Soviet government's declaration of October 30, 1956, will constitute the rock-solid foundation of the unity of the socialist camp and the friendship between socialist countries.
    Polish-Chinese friendship is now and will continue to be an important factor in consolidating the unity of the entire socialist camp.
    Precisely because of this, we are very happy to be able to host our Chinese friends in Warsaw, to be able to express to them the sincere feelings of the Polish people for the fraternal Chinese people. We regard the victories and achievements of the Chinese people as our own victories and achievements, and as the victory of the common cause of socialism and peace.
    The cause of socialism and peace is our common cause, for which we have fought for decades, made sacrifices, and selflessly devoted ourselves—this is the cause of hundreds of millions of people, the cause of the first socialist country, the Soviet Union, the cause of great China, the cause of all countries building socialism, the cause and hope of the working people of the world, a cause closely related to independence, a cause cherished by the Polish people.
    The Polish people, under the leadership of the working class, will do their utmost to contribute to this common cause, thereby strengthening the strength of the socialist camp and strengthening the unity between socialist countries that cooperate with each other based on the Leninist principles of equality and sovereignty. Precisely because of this, we will continue to develop the sincere friendly relations between the Polish and Chinese people and our parties.

    在华沙群众大会上
    波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹的演说（摘要）
    波兰一贯支持中国关于恢复在联合国的权利以及台湾统一于祖国的要求。　　波中两国的合作是具体的、全面的和日益增进的合作。
　　波苏联合声明加强了社会主义国家之间的团结，把它提高到更高的水平。
    波兰人民认为中华人民共和国政府总理周恩来同志和中国政府代表团的访问是一个十分重要的政治事件。因为我们大家都充分知道，人民中国这个人口众多、地大物博的正在建设社会主义的大国，在整个国际力量对比当中所起的作用。
    中国人民在人民中国诞生以来的短短时间里，在中国共产党的领导下，在社会主义建设中取得了巨大的成就，如果考虑到几世纪来的落后遗产，这不是一件容易的事情。中国在国内的发展方面，在外交政策方面，取得了巨大的成就，在亚洲各国和全世界赢得了极大的威望。这对于将来其他国家的民族解放斗争也有重要的意义。
    帝国主义势力企图阻挠各国人民努力争取自由和独立的斗争进程是徒劳的。由于目前国际舞台上力量对比的特点是社会主义力量不断增长的优势，考虑到现在被剥削被压迫的各国人民进行斗争的坚决意志，殖民制度的彻底垮台仅仅是一个时间的问题而已。这一点已经由英、法、以色列侵略埃及的严重失败证实了，这是本世纪殖民主义最大的失败之一。
    殖民主义者的努力将是枉然的，即使它们像现在所作的一样，用夜莺的声音来表示他们的贪婪意图，并且给这种意图安上反殖民主义的名义。
    我们确信，有关人士将对这种局势作出清醒的估计，给殖民主义镀金的计划将被放弃。惯于被帝国主义者当作剥削的目标和地方的人民的政治积极性日益增长，他们的民族觉悟日益提高，这种事实肯定将有助于达到这个目的。
    如同已经在许多场合非常郑重地强调指出的那样，波兰人民共和国和中华人民共和国尽管在地理上距离遥远，它们之间的关系正在顺利地发展着。
    人民波兰一贯坚决支持人民中国要求承认它在联合国组织内应有的地位的权利。我们所以支持这个要求是因为，拒绝让六亿人民的代表有可能在联合国讲坛上表示他们的意见，拒绝让他们有可能参加一个以巩固和平作为自己任务的组织的工作，这种做法可以继续多久呢？在我们看来，这似乎不能够再继续下去了。我们认为，给予中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位，这对于中国人民来说，是必不可少的，但对于联合国组织来说，则更是必不可少的，只有这样，它才有可能成为实现建立它的时候所规定的任务的真正有效的工具。
    我们也一贯坚决支持中华人民共和国和全体中国人民使台湾统一于祖国的要求。
    波兰人民极为钦佩和同情地注视着中华人民共和国的灵活和明智的政策，一种在和平共处五项原则的基础上发展起来的政策。
    应该说，就波中两国合作来说，我们的合作不仅限于互相抱有良好的愿望，而且是一种具体的、全面的和日益增进的合作。这涉及政治问题，也涉及经济、文化关系。波兰和人民中国是属于社会主义国家大家庭的。社会主义国家的团结、一致、互助和经验交流，是我们各国进一步发展、社会主义有可能获得进一步成就以及全世界进步的基础。
    这在很大程度上也靠着我们作出良好的榜样，我们的社会主义建设应该在经济、政治以及社会关系方面，把这种榜样提供给全世界的工人阶级（他们也必须了解，我们的人民是在十分不利的经济条件下开始建设社会主义的），提供给以前受兼并主义者和殖民主义者、帝国主义者和资本家的阻挠而不能获得与其他国家同样发展的那些国家的工人阶级。取得了政权并且开始建设社会主义的人民群众，已经争取到了这种发展的可能性。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会为社会主义国家之间的关系和国际工人阶级运动的前途开辟了一个新时代。在共同消除以前时期中所发生的偏差的时候，我们是在加强而不是削弱社会主义国家之间的团结，我们是在把它提高到更高的水平，是在无可争辩地加强它。举例来说，去年11月的波苏联合声明就为这一点提供了证据。根据苏联政府在1956年10月30日的宣言中所强调的尊重主权和平等权利的原则建立社会主义国家之间的关系，将构成社会主义阵营团结、社会主义国家之间友谊的磐石般的基础。
    波中友谊现在是，将来还是巩固整个社会主义阵营的团结的一个重要因素。
    正因为这样，所以我们为能够在华沙招待我们的中国朋友，能够向他们表示波兰人民对于兄弟的中国人民的诚挚的感情而感到非常高兴，我们把中国人民的胜利和成就看作是我们自己的胜利和成就，看作是社会主义和和平的共同事业的胜利。
    社会主义和和平的事业是我们的共同事业，为了这个事业，我们进行了几十年的斗争、作了牺牲和忘我的献身——这是数亿人民的事业，第一个社会主义国家苏联的事业，伟大的中国的事业，一切建设社会主义的国家的事业，全世界劳动人民的事业和希望，同独立密切有关的事业，一个为波兰人民所珍视的事业。
    波兰人民在工人阶级的领导下将要尽他们的最大努力为这个共同事业作出贡献，从而加强社会主义阵营的力量，加强根据列宁主义关于平等和主权的原则而互相合作的社会主义国家之间的团结。正因为这样，所以我们要继续发展波兰人民和中国人民以及我们的党之间的真挚的友好关系。
