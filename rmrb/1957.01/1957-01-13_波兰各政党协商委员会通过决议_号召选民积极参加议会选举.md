Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 12th: According to the Polish Press Agency, the Consultative Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, the United People's Party, and the Democratic Party passed a resolution regarding parliamentary elections at its meeting on January 10th.

The resolution stated that the election campaign is about to enter a decisive stage. The parties unanimously believe that, in view of the rampant activities of forces hostile to the people's regime and national interests, the unity of all socialist democratic forces and all patriotic forces in the country is more necessary than ever before.

The political parties have jointly put forward a list of candidates for parliamentary elections—namely, the list of candidates for the National Unity Front. All parties participating in the election have placed the names of their leaders at the forefront of the list because they believe they are the best and most worthy to be elected as members of the future parliament. Therefore, the political parties call on their members and the masses of voters to vote for the candidates listed at the front of the list, according to the number of deputies to be elected in their respective constituencies.

The resolution stated that carrying out the election campaign united under this slogan is the responsibility of the members and activists of the parties and organizations united within the National Unity Front. We have a responsibility to resolutely smash any reactionary sabotage activities and pre-election demagoguery, and to resolutely smash any conspiracy aimed at undermining national unity.

The political parties pointed out that certain parliamentary candidates have adopted disloyal methods towards the candidates of allied parties during the election campaign, taking advantage of the simplicity of the people and the credulity of the voters, and making populist promises. Some candidates, fearing the loss of their prestige, have failed to counter hostile or provocative remarks. We strongly condemn this method in the election campaign and instruct the political parties' consultative committees across the country to counter the disloyal behavior of parliamentary candidates; if necessary, according to legal provisions, before January 17th, to remove the names of those candidates from the National Unity Front who have shown timidity, irresponsibility for their actions, and have not adhered to the principles of the National Unity Front's program and the discipline of the political parties.

The political parties call on all citizens to fulfill their responsibilities and participate in the parliamentary elections on January 20, 1957.

The resolution concluded by saying that only a new parliament elected according to the will of the vast majority of the Polish people can fulfill its tasks. Participation in the election is the responsibility of every Pole, the responsibility of everyone who defends sovereignty, democracy, and Poland's path to socialism, and the responsibility of everyone who supports the new political line of People's Poland.

    波兰各政党协商委员会通过决议
    号召选民积极参加议会选举
    新华社华沙12日电　据波兰通讯社报道，波兰统一工人党、统一农民党和民主党协商委员会，在1月10日的会议上通过了一项关于议会选举的决议。
    决议说，选举运动即将进入决定性阶段。各政党一致认为，鉴于敌视人民政权和国家利益的势力的活动的猖獗，全国一切社会主义民主力量和一切爱国力量的团结就比过去任何时期更为必要了。
    各政党已经联合提出了议会选举候选人的名单——即全国统一阵线的候选人名单——，参加选举的所有政党都把它们的领导人的名字放在名单的前列，因为它们认为他们是最好和最值得选为未来议会的议员的。因此，各政党号召他们的党员和选民群众按照各自的选区需要选出的议员数目，投票选举列在名单前面的候选人。
    决议说，在这个口号下团结一致地进行选举运动，是团结在全国统一阵线内的各政党和组织的党员和活动分子的责任。我们有责任坚决粉碎任何反动的破坏活动和选举前的煽惑活动，坚决粉碎任何企图破坏全国团结的阴谋活动。
    各政党指出，某些议会候选人在选举运动中对盟党的候选人采用了不忠实的手段，利用人民的纯朴和选民们的轻信，提出了笼络人心的诺言。某些候选人害怕丧失他们的威望，因而对敌对的或挑衅性的言论不予反击。我们坚决指责选举运动中的这种方法，指令全国各地的政党协商委员会反击议会候选人的不忠实行为；如果必要的话，可以按照法律条款，在1月17日之前，把全国统一阵线的那些表现了胆小、对他们的行动不负责任、并且没有遵守全国统一阵线纲领的原则和各政党的纪律的候选人的名字从名单上划去。
    各政党号召全体公民履行他们的责任，参加1957年1月20日的议会选举。
    决议最后说，只有按波兰全国绝大多数人民的意志选出来的新议会，才能完成它的任务。参加选举是每一个波兰人的责任，是每一个维护主权、民主和波兰走向社会主义道路的人的责任，是每一个赞成人民波兰新政治路线的人的责任。
