Observer's Commentary

	Procrastination is Not the Solution
	The heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France sent letters to the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, on January 2nd and 3rd of this month respectively, responding to the Soviet government's disarmament proposals of November 17th of last year. In these letters, they expressed their willingness to continue efforts to achieve disarmament on the one hand, but on the other hand, they didn't say a single word about the many positive disarmament proposals put forward by the Soviet Union, and flatly refused to hold a five-nation summit to discuss disarmament issues. This seemingly contradictory attitude is difficult to understand.
	The disarmament proposals put forward by the Soviet government on November 17th of last year were widely welcomed by world opinion. Even the Western bourgeois press had to admit that the Soviet proposals provided a good basis for breaking the disarmament stalemate. All people who desire peace hoped that the Soviet proposals would receive a positive response from Western countries immediately. But after a delay of more than a month, the response from the governments of the United States, Britain, and France not only fails to promote the resolution of the disarmament issue, but can only be seen as a deliberate attempt to undermine the peace aspirations of the people of all countries, in order to maintain international tensions.
	As everyone knows, the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a five-nation summit was made in response to the appeal of the President of the Swiss Confederation. This proposal truly reflects the universal hope of the people of all countries. The achievements of the Geneva Four-Power Summit have already proven that such direct consultations are greatly beneficial to reconciling differences and thus promoting the easing of international tensions. Considering that the disarmament issue has been entangled in the United Nations for so many years without significant progress, it is impossible not to consider it necessary to hold a five-nation summit to negotiate on disarmament issues. However, the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France insisted that there is no "environment" for holding such a meeting at present, and arbitrarily declared that "discussing disarmament issues at the highest-level meeting would probably not achieve much progress"; they insisted on "discussions within the United Nations framework."
	However, there is no evidence to prove that the United States truly intends to resolve the disarmament issue in the United Nations. On the same day that U.S. President Eisenhower sent his reply to Chairman Bulganin, the U.S. representative tried his best to postpone the discussion of the disarmament issue in the United Nations General Assembly. In their letters, the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France also expressed their intention to push the disarmament issue to the subcommittee of the Disarmament Committee, which they proposed to convene after March, where they attempted to resume endless debates. It can be seen that the refusal of the United States, Britain, and France to hold a five-nation summit and their insistence on discussing the disarmament issue within the United Nations framework is merely a consistent tactic of Western countries to delay the resolution of the disarmament issue. The statement by the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France that they "will continue to strive for the effective control and reduction of all armaments" can only be regarded as empty rhetoric.
	The people of the world are eager to stop the arms race and demand that an agreement be reached on the disarmament issue immediately in order to ease international tensions. The United States, Britain, and France continue to adopt delaying tactics to prevent an agreement on the disarmament issue, in order to continue the arms race and exacerbate international tensions.
	However, procrastination is not the solution. Delaying will only further expose the unwillingness of Western countries to disarm, and will only be met with stronger condemnation and opposition from the people of the world.

### 拖延不是办法

    拖延不是办法
    美、英、法三国政府首脑于本月2日和3日分别致函苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁，对苏联政府去年11月17日提出的裁军建议提出答复。在这些信里，他们一方面表示愿意继续为实现裁军而努力，另一方面却对苏联提出的许多有关裁军的积极建议，不说一个是字，还一口拒绝举行五国政府首脑会议来讨论裁军问题。这种显然自相矛盾的态度，是很难令人理解的。
    苏联政府去年11月17日提出的裁军建议，曾受到世界舆论的广泛欢迎。甚至西方资产阶级报刊也不得不承认苏联的建议为打开裁军僵局提供了良好的基础。一切愿意和平的人们都期望着苏联的建议能马上得到西方国家积极的反应。但是在拖延了一个多月之后，美、英、法三国政府所作出的这种答复，不仅不能有助于促进裁军问题的解决，而且只能被认为它们是故意要打击各国人民的和平愿望，借以保持国际紧张局势。
    大家知道，苏联声明中关于召开五国首脑会议的建议，是根据瑞士联邦主席的呼吁而提出的。这种主张确实反映了各国人民的普遍希望。日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的成就，已经证明这种直接磋商大大有益于协调分歧意见从而促进国际局势的缓和。如果考虑到裁军问题在联合国中纠缠了这么多年而始终未能获得显著的进展，就不能不认为举行五国首脑会议来就裁军问题进行协商是十分必要的。但是美、英、法三国政府首脑却硬说目前并不存在举行这种会议的“环境”，而且武断地宣称在“最高级会议上讨论裁军问题，大概不会取得什么进展”；他们坚持要“在联合国范围内进行讨论”。
    但是，现在并没有事实可以证明美国真正打算在联合国中解决裁军问题。就在美国总统艾森豪威尔发出他给布尔加宁主席的复信的同一天，美国的代表就在联合国大会中竭力推延裁军问题的讨论。美、英、法三国政府首脑在他们的信里，也表示要把裁军问题推到他们主张在3月以后才召开的裁军委员会小组委员会中去，他们企图在那里再来恢复无休止的辩论。由此可见，美、英、法拒绝举行五国政府首脑会议而坚持要在联合国范围内讨论裁军问题，不过是西方国家拖延解决裁军问题的一贯手法。美、英、法三国政府首脑表示“将继续为了有效地管制和裁减一切军备而努力”，这只能被看作是一句动听的空话罢了。
    全世界人民都渴望停止军备竞赛，要求立即就裁军问题达成协议，以便缓和国际紧张局势。美、英、法三国却继续采取拖延战术，阻挠裁军问题达成协议，以便继续进行军备竞赛，加剧国际紧张局势。
    但是，拖延不是办法。拖延只会更加暴露西方国家不愿裁军的面目，只会遭到世界人民更加强烈的谴责和反对。
