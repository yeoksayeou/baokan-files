The Large Stone Casket Under the Wanfo Pagoda

　　At the beginning of this year, one hundred cultural relics, including sutra pillars, Buddha statues, bronze mirrors, and coins, were excavated from the foundation of the destroyed Wanfo Pagoda in Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province. Many of these are of significant historical and artistic value. These relics had been treasured within a large stone casket, located in the pagoda's foundation, which was inscribed with scriptures from the seventh year of the Northern Song Dynasty's Jiayou reign.

　　Among the relics, the most eye-catching is an ancient structure—a sutra pillar—only 1.33 meters high. Its architectural style is very exquisite, with a "Wudian style" roof and a lotus pedestal as its base. The sutra pillar is inscribed with the words "Jiayou seventh year of the Northern Song Dynasty."

　　In addition, there are fifteen iron-cast, gold-plated pagodas from the Five Dynasties' Wuyue period inside the stone casket.

    万佛塔下的大石函
    今年年初，在浙江省金华市已毁的万佛塔的塔基下，发掘出经幢、佛像、铜镜和钱币等一百件文物。其中有很多是在历史上和艺术上具有重要价值的。这些文物一直珍藏在塔基下一个有北宋嘉祐七年刻经的大石函内。
    文物中最引人注目的是一座仅有一公尺三公寸高的古代建筑物——经幢。它的建筑形式非常精美，幢顶是“庑殿式”的，幢基是一个莲花座。经幢上刻有北宋嘉祐七年的字样。
    此外，石函内还有十五座五代吴越的铁铸金涂塔。
