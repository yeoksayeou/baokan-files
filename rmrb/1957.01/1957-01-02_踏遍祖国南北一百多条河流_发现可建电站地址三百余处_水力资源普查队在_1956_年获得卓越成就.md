Xinhua News Agency, December 31st. The twenty-nine hydroelectric resource survey teams dispatched by the Ministry of Electric Power Industry conducted surveys in 1956 on over a hundred large and medium-sized rivers in fourteen provinces (regions), from the Red River and Li Xian River (international river systems) in Yunnan Province in the south, to the Second Songhua River in Jilin in the north, from the Qiantang River in the east, to the Yili River in the west, providing the state with data on tens of millions of kilowatts of hydropower resources suitable for building hydroelectric power stations. Among them, in the southwest region, which accounts for more than half of the country's hydropower resources, more than fifty rivers were surveyed, and more than three hundred potential sites for building hydroelectric power stations were found.

Most of these rivers run through high mountains, with abundant water volume and excellent conditions for building hydroelectric power stations. For example, the Wujiang River, one of the major tributaries of the Yangtze River, known as a natural barrier, has high mountains and deep valleys along the river, with sheer cliffs and turbulent river water with many rapids. In this survey, seventy-six potential sites for building hydroelectric power stations were selected, some of which have power generation capacities of 500,000 to 1,000,000 kilowatts. The Yangbi River, a tributary of the Lancang River in Yunnan Province, although a small river, also contains millions of kilowatts of hydropower resources. Survey personnel selected twenty-one hydropower station sites in just a 280-kilometer section of the river. One of the hydropower station sites can rely on natural reservoir regulation, making future construction very simple and requiring little investment.

In this survey work, the survey personnel also overcame difficulties such as harsh climate and inconvenient transportation, and went deep into many remote and sparsely populated areas for investigation. The hydropower resources discovered in these places far exceeded the original estimates. For example, the Tongtian River, the source of the Yangtze River, which has always been considered to be located inland with little water, was found to have more water volume and a greater drop than originally estimated after this survey. The discovered hydropower resources also exceeded the original estimate by nearly double, and more than a dozen hydropower station sites were found.

    踏遍祖国南北一百多条河流　发现可建电站地址三百余处
    水力资源普查队在1956年获得卓越成就
    新华社31日讯　电力工业部派出的二十九个水力资源普查队，1956年在南自云南省的国际水系——红河、李仙江，北至吉林的第二松花江，东从钱塘江，西到伊犁河的十四个省（区）的一百多条大中型河流上进行了普查工作，为国家提供了可以建设水电站的几千万瓩的水力资源资料。其中只在占全国水力资源一半以上的西南地区，经过普查的河流就有五十多条，共计找到了三百多个可以建设水电站的地址。
    这些河流大多数穿行在高山之间，水量丰沛，建设水电站的条件十分优越。如长江的大支流之一——乌江，素有天险之称，沿江山高谷深，断崖削壁，江水汹涌，急滩比比，在这次普查中就选出了七十六个可以建设水电站的地址，其中有的发电能力可以达到五十万到一百万瓩。云南省澜沧江的支流——漾濞江虽然是一条不大的河流，但是也蕴藏着上百万瓩的水力资源，普查人员只在二百八十公里的河段上就选出了二十一个水电站的地址。其中有一个水电站地址可以依靠天然水库调节，将来建设工程很简单，投资很小。
    在这次普查工作中，普查人员还克服了气候恶劣、交通不便等困难，深入到了许多人迹罕到的地方去调查。在这些地方发现的水力资源，大大超过了原来的估计。例如一向被认为地处内陆，水量不多的长江河源通天河，经过这次普查结果，水量和落差都超过了原来的估计，所发现的水力资源，也超过原来估计将近一倍，并且找到了十多个水电站地址。
