Xinhua News Agency, January 18th: Mikhailov, head of the Soviet cultural delegation and Soviet Minister of Culture, said at a press conference held in Beijing today: The 1957 executive plan for the Sino-Soviet Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed today is another important milestone in the further development of cultural relations between the Soviet Union and China.

Mikhailov said that the scale of measures in the 1957 executive plan far exceeds the scale of Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation in the past few years. Within the scope of this plan, we will organize more than 50 mutual visits, including delegations and individual science, culture, and art workers. About one thousand people will participate in the visits.

Mikhailov said that famous Sino-Soviet art troupes will visit each other. The Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theatre, the Kazakh National Orchestra, and other groups will come to China for touring performances. A large Chinese acrobatic troupe and song and dance troupe will visit the Soviet Union.

Mikhailov said that mutual visits between writers, painters, and sculptors of the two countries will be expanded. In terms of film, joint production of feature films will begin. This year, the number of Chinese books translated by the Soviet Union will be doubled compared to last year. The Soviet Union and China will hold some art exhibitions. The plan also stipulates important measures in higher education, education, and health.

Mikhailov said, why have the ties between our two countries in culture and science been so consolidated and achieved such a large scale in a relatively short period of time? This is because these ties are an important part of the eternal and unbreakable Sino-Soviet friendship, and because these ties are built on the solid foundation of the great and invincible Marxism-Leninism.

The press conference was presided over by Zhang Zhixiang, Deputy Minister of Culture. More than 30 Chinese and foreign journalists attended the press conference.

    苏文化部长谈中苏文化交流的巨大规模
    新华社18日讯　苏联文化代表团团长、苏联文化部部长米哈伊洛夫今天在北京举行的记者招待会上说：今天签订的苏中文化合作协定1957年执行计划是进一步发展苏中两国之间文化关系的又一个重要的里程碑。
    米哈伊洛夫说，1957年执行计划按其措施的规模来说，大大地超过了过去几年的中苏文化合作的规模。在这个计划范围内我们将要组织五十多起互相访问，其中包括代表团以及个别的科学、文化、艺术工作者。将要参加访问的共有一千人左右。
    米哈伊洛夫说，中苏著名的艺术团体将互相访问。新西伯利亚歌舞剧院、哈萨克民族乐队和其他团体将到中国来作巡回演出。到苏联去访问的有大型的中国杂技团和歌舞团。
    米哈伊洛夫说，两国作家、画家和雕刻家之间的互相访问将要扩大。在电影方面将要开始共同摄制艺术影片。今年苏联翻译中国书籍的数目将要比去年增加两倍。苏中两国将举办一些艺术展览会。计划还规定了在高等教育、教育和卫生方面的重要措施。
    米哈伊洛夫说，在较短的时间内，我们两国在文化和科学方面的联系为什么如此巩固并且得到这么大的规模呢？这是因为这些联系是永恒的、牢不可破的中苏友谊的重要组成部分，因为这些联系是建立在伟大的、不可战胜的马克思列宁主义学说的坚实基础上的。
    记者招待会是由文化部副部长张致祥主持的。参加招待会的有中外记者三十多人。
