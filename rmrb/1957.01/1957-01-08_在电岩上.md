Title: On Electric Rock

When our jeep climbed up White Fish Mountain in Lushun Port, we could see the entire port surface of Lushun Port before even reaching the top of the mountain. At this moment, I naturally remembered a famous novel describing naval warfare: "Lushun Port." I read this novel five years ago, and the thrilling war it depicted between the Russian and Japanese fleets on the Bohai Sea surface, as well as the incredibly rich factual material it was based on, left me with a very, very deep impression. I have not forgotten this book to this day.

"Look, that's 'Tiger Tail'!" Comrade Yi, who accompanied me, pointed to a small mountain in the middle of the port's sea surface, and simply introduced it to me: "Electric Rock! We'll go to Electric Rock in a moment!..."

The long, pointed island across the harbor, when viewed from this side, appears connected to Tiger Mountain, so the name "Tiger Tail" is very fitting. This name seemed very familiar to me. Later, I remembered that both "Electric Rock" and this name were mentioned in the novel "Lushun Port." We are now talking, thinking, and reminiscing about the things described in the novel.

"Look! These are the cannons left over from that war!"

I turned around and saw a cannon barrel more than two zhang long, built on the hillside. A child could crawl into the muzzle. The blackish-yellow cannon body was engraved with the characters "1897," probably recording the year.

This old-fashioned, but thick cannon barrel, although the base was damaged, still gave us a sense of power...

We hurriedly set off towards "Electric Rock" again. At this time, the jeep was bumping and speeding along the road. Through the glass window, I looked at the black shadow of Tiger Mountain across the port, rising and falling unevenly on the port surface. I heard that the ancient castle of the commander described in the novel "Lushun Port" still exists today. When the Russo-Japanese War broke out, the old Russian naval commander was holding a ball in the hall of his ancient castle... Even this ballroom still exists today.

However, sitting in the car, I couldn't see this ancient castle.

Ten minutes later, the jeep was climbing the hillside again. We arrived at the easternmost position extending into the sea. This is a very hidden place.

A young, short but very sturdy company commander greeted us. His name is "Company Commander Hou."

"This is the Electric Rock described in the novel 'Lushun Port'!" The company commander introduced as soon as we met: "In the novel, a lieutenant was injured here, crawled over there and continued to resist..."

As Company Commander Hou spoke, he led us to that place with quick steps, lightly tapping the ground with his toe.

I looked up ahead: This is a moving place. To the east is an endless expanse of waves. Electric Rock extends out here like the arm of a giant, blocking the impact of the waves and the howling sea breeze... I looked down at my feet, and below were rocks several zhang high, and white waves splashed up by the rocks...

In such a place, listening to this ancient but heroic story, the persistence of resistance and the tragic scene of the soldiers' final annihilation still gives us an unspeakable power that excites us.

It was this sensational, world-rare Russo-Japanese naval battle that made Lushun Port famous throughout the world.

Now, of course, all of this has passed, although history has left its mark. But whether it is the old, thick cannon barrel, or this "Electric Rock" that rises above the sea and resists the sea breeze and waves, today it has only become another kind of meaning. Today, here are the people armed with modern weapons who grew up on this land.

Company Commander Hou warmly invited us to their sentry post. At this time, it was slowly getting dark. Once the sun set to the west, it became very cold on the rocks. The sea breeze made the wooden sentry post rattle.

"Are you always here?"

"We are here day and night, rain or shine!" Company Commander Hou said: "The position cannot be left unattended!"

Before my eyes appeared the twilight with strong winds, the wind tearing the waves on the sea, tearing the branches, sand and stones... The people guarding the position, they stood in this tearing wind...

Before my eyes also seemed to appear the snowy night, snowflakes flying quietly, falling on the trees, falling on the position, falling on the sentry post... The soldiers are at the gate of the motherland, the northeasternmost border, always vigilant about the wind and clouds at sea! Taking risks for the people...

The company commander told me:

"On night duty at the position, guarding the telephone. When there's nothing to do, we study politics and culture under the lamp... It's often like this..."

Before my eyes, I seemed to see the shadow of this company commander lying on the wooden planks of the sentry post, silently writing something, watching something. And outside the sentry post, at this time, was the cold sea breeze and the terrible waves in the distant accompaniment...

This is such a diligent and hard life and work. Who has ever studied and worked constantly day and night on such an Electric Rock, in such a late night? What kind of unprecedented thing has happened here? Please bless the light that occasionally shines from the sentry post at one or two o'clock in the late night.

Looking at this narrow and simple sentry post, and the soldiers guarding here, I asked them many other things about Electric Rock, but I did not ask about their lives and rewards. I know that they did not come to this position for rewards. I don't think any reward could make them come here, make them so hard and still so happy... For this reason alone, when I think of Electric Rock, what makes it unforgettable and cannot but excite me is not its history, but its present.

    在电岩上
    柯蓝
    我们的吉普车爬上旅顺口白鱼山的时候，还没有到山顶就已经看到旅顺口的全部港面了。这时候我就很自然地记起了一部有名的、描写海战的小说：“旅顺口”。这部小说我是五年以前读过的，它所描写的日俄舰队在渤海海面发生的惊心动魄的战争，以及它所依据的无比丰富的真实材料，给了我极深极深的印象。我至今都没有忘掉这本书。
    “你看，那就是‘老虎尾巴’！”陪我来的易同志，指着港口海面当中的一个小山，很简单地在向我介绍：“电岩！等会我们就到电岩！……”
    横在港口的那个长尖的小岛，从这边看去就跟老虎山接连着，取名“老虎尾巴”真是太像了。这名字我仿佛很熟悉。后来记起连同
  “电岩”这个名字，都是在“旅顺口”那部小说里见过。我们现在是按着小说里所描写过的事物在谈话，在思索，在回忆。
      “看！这就是那次战争留下来的大炮！”
    我回过身来，就看见一个两丈多长的大炮筒，修在山坡上。炮口可以钻进去一个小孩。黑黄黑黄的炮身上，刻着“一八九七”几个字，大概是记载年代的。
    这个古式、但却粗大的炮筒，虽然炮基已经损坏，仍然给我们一种威力……
    我们又匆忙地朝“电岩”出发了。吉普车这时候在公路上颠簸着，奔驰着。我隔着玻璃窗，望着对面港口老虎山的黑影，起伏不平地突出在港面。我听说“旅顺口”小说中所描写的那座司令官的古堡，至今还在。当初日俄海战刚爆发的时候，那位旧俄海军司令，正在他的古堡大厅举行舞会……就连这个跳舞厅至今也还在。
    不过我坐在车子里，却看不到这座古堡。
    十分钟之后，吉普车又在爬山坡了。我们来到了最东面的伸出海面的阵地。这是一个很隐蔽的地方。
    一位年轻的、矮个子但很结实的连长，接待了我们。他叫“侯连长”。
    “这里，就是旅顺口小说中描写的电岩！”这位连长一见面就这么介绍起来了：“小说里有一位中尉在这里受伤，爬到那边继续抵抗，……”
    侯连长一边说一边用快步引我们到那个地方，用脚尖在地上轻轻地点了一点。
    我抬头朝前看去：这是一个动人的地方。东面是一片无边的海浪。电岩像一个巨人的臂膀伸出在这里，拦阻着波浪的冲击，和那呼啸而来的海风……我低头朝脚下看去，下面却是几丈高的岩石，和被岩石碰溅起来的白浪……
    在这样的地方，听着这个古老的，但是英勇的故事，那种坚持抵抗，和士兵们最后全军复灭的壮烈情景，仍然有一种说不出的力量，使我们激动。
    就是这一次骇人听闻的、世界上罕见的日俄大海战，使旅顺口闻名全世界。
    现在，这一切当然都过去了，尽管历史留下了它的印证。但不管它是古老粗大的炮筒，或是这个高出海面，抗击着海风和海浪的“电岩”，今天也只是成了另外的一种意义。今天，在这里的是用现代化武装起来的、生长在这土地上的人民。
    侯连长热情地把我们招待到他们的哨棚里。这时候，天慢慢暗下来了。太阳一偏西，岩上就变得十分寒冷。海风把木板搭起的哨棚，吹得哗哗地响。
      “你们经常在这里吗？”
    “我们不管白日黑夜，刮风下雨，都在这里！”侯连长说：“阵地不能离人啊！”
    我的眼前出现了刮着大风的黄昏，大风在海上撕裂着波浪，撕裂着树枝、沙石……坚守阵地的人，他们就站在这撕裂一切的大风里……
    我的眼前又仿佛出现了下雪的深夜，雪片在静静地飞舞，落在树上，落在阵地上，落在哨棚上……战士们就在这祖国的大门，最东北的边线，时刻警惕着海上的风云！替人民承担着风险……
    连长告诉我：
      “晚上在阵地值班，守着电话机。没有事就在灯下，学政治、学文化……常常这样，……”
    我的眼前似乎又看见了这位连长的影子伏在哨棚的木板上，在一声不响地写着什么，看着什么。而哨棚的外面，这时候，却是深夜寒冷的海风和可怕的海浪，在远远地陪伴……
  这是多辛勤和艰苦的生活和工作。有谁曾经在这样的电岩上，在这样的深夜，日日夜夜不断地学习过、工作过呢？这是什么样的从来没有发生过的事情，在这里发生了呢？请为这深夜一两点钟，从哨棚偶尔透出的灯光祝福吧。
    我望着这狭小而简陋的哨棚，和在这里守卫的战士们，我问了他们有关电岩的许多其他事情，我却没有问他们的生活和报酬。我知道他们不是为报酬才到这个岗位上来的。我看，没有任何报酬可以使他们到这里来，使他们如此艰苦还如此愉快……就为这，我一想起电岩，它使我难忘和不能不激动的，并不是它的历史，而是它的现在。
