    Wang Guijun Shock Brigade Achieves Initiative Ahead of Schedule

    (Our Newspaper dispatch) The nationally renowned youth excavator shock brigade – the Wang Guijun Shock Brigade of the Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation – completed their initiative to fulfill two years and eight months of production tasks within one year of 1956, nine and a half days ahead of schedule, during the early shift on December 22. The production task reached 168,073 cubic meters of earth, creating more than 250,000 yuan of wealth for the country and saving more than 1,000 kilograms of gasoline.

    The Wang Guijun Shock Brigade's initiative was proposed on the basis of their overfulfilment of the 1955 production task, in response to the call for "more, faster, better, and more economical." After meticulous calculation, all team members displayed a high degree of enthusiasm in their work, overcoming difficulties such as the hot climate. In their work, they created "shallow digging, full loading, layer-by-layer soil extraction" and were good at using the terrain to extract soil nearby. They also conscientiously studied advanced experience such as the mechanical cycle maintenance method, thereby ensuring that the mechanical attendance rate was above 90%. Through this year's exercise, the Wang Guijun Shock Brigade's technical strength has become even stronger. The original first- to third-grade driver assistants have been promoted to the fourth-grade level, and the third-grade drivers have been promoted to fifth-grade drivers. Chang Juhe, the original first-grade technician, has now been promoted to a fourth-grade driver and transferred to other locomotives to serve as a captain. Now they are continuing their efforts to strive for greater achievements in production.

    王贵君突击队提前实现倡议
    本报讯　全国著名的青年挖土机突击队——武汉冶金建筑总公司王贵君突击队，于12月22日早班以提前九天半的时间实现了他们在1956年一年内完成二年零八个月的生产任务的倡议，生产任务达到十六万八千零七十三立方公尺土，为国家多创造了财富二十五万元和节约了一千多公斤汽油。
    王贵君突击队这个倡议是在他们超额完成1955年生产任务的基础上，响应了“又多、又快、又好、又省”的号召，通过算细账的方法后提出的。为了提高工作效率，全体队员在工作中发挥了高度的积极性，克服了气候炎热等等困难，在工作中创造了“浅挖满装，层层取土”和善于利用地形就近取土，以及认真学习了对机械循环保养法等先进经验，从而保证了机械的出勤率在90％以上。通过这一年的锻炼，王贵君突击队技术力量更加坚强了，原系一级到三级的司机助手，都已经提到四级水平，三级司机已经升为五级司机。原一级技工苌巨和现已经提为四级司机，并且调往其他机车担任机长职务。现在他们正在继续努力争取生产中的更大的成就。
