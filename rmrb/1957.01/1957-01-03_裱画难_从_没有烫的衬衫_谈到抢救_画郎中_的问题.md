    Mounting Paintings is Difficult
    From “Unironed Shirts” to Rescuing the Problem of “Painting Doctors”
    Fu Baoshi
    Recently, Chinese painting practitioners have universally encountered an extremely serious problem: the mounting of paintings. In particular, comrades in art organizations or relevant cultural departments responsible for exhibition work are suffering unspeakable hardships. Most of the works from the Second National Chinese Painting Exhibition, which recently concluded in Shanghai, were mounted in Beijing. When I visited the exhibition in Shanghai, I couldn't help but recall a conversation I had with a comrade in Beijing who was in charge of the exhibition, who said, "Alas! After all the begging and pleading, we ended up with a bunch of 'unironed shirts.'" This statement is not an exaggeration.
    I also recall the winter of 1953 when the "Anhui Provincial Museum Preparatory Office" was still in Wuhu. I was invited to see their collection of ancient paintings. There were some truly wonderful pieces that I still cherish to this day. However, what I regret even more is that many items were so poorly mounted that they may never recover. When I opened a small album of Yuan and Ming dynasty miscellaneous paintings on silk, fragments flew out with abandon, and the thickness of each page was no less than three layers of one-hundred-pound wood-based paper. I once angrily criticized the presumptuous mounters and repeatedly requested that they hire skilled "painting doctors" in the future; otherwise, it would be better not to touch them. I heard that they later paid attention to this issue. However, several famous paintings that had suffered were beyond salvation.
    As a work of art, in addition to the artistic level of the painting being determined by the artist, mounting is the most important step. If this step is done well, it not only enhances the work but also can "extend its life." If it is done poorly, it will greatly detract from a satisfactory work, even causing it to suffer undue damage and acquire chronic ailments that prevent it from ever being healthy. Almost all painters, calligraphers, connoisseurs, and collectors deeply appreciate the joys and sufferings involved in this process.
    Precisely because of this, painters, calligraphers, connoisseurs, and collectors throughout history have paid special attention to mounting work. Especially for old paintings, they must seek out "skilled craftsmen" with ingenious techniques and go to great lengths to build relationships, using humble words and generous gifts, treating them like honored guests. They do this, of course, for the sake of the artistic effect and artistic life of the artwork. We know that the materials of famous Chinese paintings and calligraphies are nothing more than paper and silk, and the life of paper and silk requires special care. In particular, old works, some decades old, some hundreds of years old, or even more than a thousand years old, their remounting is like facing a life-and-death situation, completely dependent on the skills and experience of the "doctor." The ancients said, "Remounting ancient works is like seeing a doctor for an illness" (Zhou Jiazhou, Ming Dynasty: *Zhuanghuang Zhi*), which is absolutely true. A skilled "doctor" can indeed "bring the dead back to life," while a mediocre "doctor" often "kills" the patient. Therefore, "the quality of mounting is truly related to the survival of famous works" (ibid.). Since the late Tang and Five Dynasties periods, mounting gradually became popular, and famous masters emerged in large numbers. Many painters and calligraphers even started doing it themselves. Chu Suiliang of the Tang Dynasty mounted Gu Kaizhi's "Qing Ye You Xi Yuan Tu" (Night Excursion to the Western Garden). Whenever Mi Fu of the Song Dynasty encountered a wonderful work by an artist of the Jin Dynasty, he would often mount and back it himself. "Although there are many hands to wash the turtle, who can match Mi in not producing hair on the scroll?" (Mi Fu: *Inscription on the Ta Ling Post*), which proves his pride in this skill. It is generally believed that the form of painting and calligraphy mounting was completed in the Two Song Dynasties, and the art of mounting developed in the Ming Dynasty. Zhou Jiazhou's *Zhuanghuang Zhi* and Zhou Erxue's *Shang Yan Suxin Lu* (early Qing Dynasty) are both specialized works on painting and calligraphy mounting. Since the Southern Song Dynasty, especially since the early Ming Dynasty, most painters and calligraphers and collectors were in the Jiangzhe region, and most mounting masters were also in this area, with Suzhou being one of the largest bases. At that time, the Tang and Qiang families were the most famous, known as "national masters." According to legend, the famous connoisseur Wang Shizhen (Yan Zhou) even bowed to the Qiang family to mount famous works. At the same time, Zhuang Xishu of Nanjing (from Suzhou) was particularly skilled and highly respected by all parties.
    According to elders, the emergence of a master is very difficult. One must be intelligent and, even more so, calm. Without the ambition of "facing the wall for nine years," one should never attempt an ancient painting. Laying one piece of paper on the work table can often take months. Not only must the hands and feet be disciplined, but even the breath must be controlled. Therefore, many in the industry do not even teach their own sons this trade. Generally speaking, in addition to strictly demanding quality materials, the important thing is to be able to distinguish the season and assess the climate. One must repeatedly ponder a work before taking action. Weather that is too dry or too humid is not suitable. The months of September and October are the best seasons, the so-called "when the weather has cooled but is not yet cold." Mounting work done in this season is much better than in other seasons. Old masters often say that Beijing and Guangzhou are not ideal places to work; only the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, especially areas close to Shanghai, have particularly suitable climates. I often think that the name "Su Mounting" (mounting in the Suzhou style) is not accidental; it has its historical reasons, material conditions, and even natural environment.
    It is undeniable that the influence of modern semi-colonial society is undoubtedly reflected in all aspects of traditional art, and painting and calligraphy mounting is no exception. Personally, I have not handled many old works and do not have a deep understanding, but my own works and some paintings from relevant work units always have to be mounted or require the services of "painting doctors." Looking back, "unpleasant things often account for eight or nine out of ten," but "it has passed," so I don't make any long-term plans. Because I understand that "this way is not prominent" today, there is no need to force it. However, I also know that there are indeed many rare talents and reputable shops, such as Liu Dingzhi and Zhou Guisheng (who attended the Second Session of the Second National People's Political Consultative Conference in January 1956) of Shanghai, "Qing Bi Ge"; Cao Zhongqing and Xie Songquan of Suzhou; Huang Dongshan of Yangzhou; "Shi Bi Jia" of Chengdu; and Liu Jintao of Beijing. In particular, Liu Dingzhi and Zhou Guisheng of Shanghai truly have the ability to "steal the sky and change the earth." I remember that at the end of 1953, I personally saw Mr. Xu Pingyu buy a horizontal scroll by Li Futang for one yuan and fifty cents (15,000 yuan at the time) at a street stall. Regrettably, someone had added a "crow"-like bird to it. Through Liu Dingzhi, the "crow" flew away! This is amazing! Mr. Liu Haisu unintentionally bought a painting album collected by Zhou Lianggong (a famous connoisseur) of the early Qing Dynasty (a wonderful and important piece from the "Lai Gu Tang"). It is said that it was nothing more than a few tattered paper balls, but through Liu Dingzhi, a complete and new work appeared! This should be another amazing feat!
    According to the terminology of the industry, those who "expertly mount ancient and modern famous paintings and calligraphy" are called those who work with "white goods." Those who specialize in making couplets, scrolls, and colored paper boards for red and white festive occasions are called those who work with "red goods." The two are completely different, with a huge disparity in quality. It can be said that they had no close connection in the past.
    In the early days of liberation, "red goods" were not popular, and "white goods" were even more miserable. Taking Nanjing as an example, some closed down, some changed careers, and many even sold their vermilion workbenches, which were their "lifelines," as firewood. Around the time of the First National Chinese Painting Exhibition in 1953, "white goods" began to revive, and business gradually improved, but they still had to do some (or mainly do) business that was "similar to white goods" (such as wall charts, pictures, papering houses, etc.). From that time on, some masters who struggled through were in high spirits and optimistic about the future.
    Since the complete (red goods and white goods) collectivization (some joint ventures) in the spring of 1956, the problem has become particularly serious. According to personal, incomplete understanding and the reflections and appeals of many Chinese painters at the recent symposium on Chinese painting work jointly held by the Jiangsu Provincial Cultural Bureau and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, there are generally three situations: (1) The price is much more expensive than before (before cooperation), generally 20%-50% more expensive; (2) The quality is much worse than before. Some sets of four works are mounted in several different shades of color, and even the four sides of the same work are of different shades; (3) As long as they are hung for a day or two, they indeed become "unironed shirts," uneven.
    Why did it turn out this way? According to understanding, the main reasons are: (1) After collectivization (joint venture), regardless of the level of skill, "everyone is treated equally," and values are calculated on a piece-rate basis. A few masters with decades of experience and those who have just passed their "rite of passage" are in a "labor competition." If you are old and can't do much, you "deserve it." In addition, the expenses of "public representatives" and "full-time cadres" have increased, and management fees are heavy (some do not add this item). "The wool comes from the sheep," and the price of materials has also risen, so how can it not be expensive? For example, in the early days of the "Yuan Hai Ge" cooperative in Nanjing, it took seven people a day to paper a few rooms for a certain unit, which cost a total of forty-three yuan. They themselves said that before collectivization, thirty yuan at most would have been enough; (2) Saving materials is something that should be done in any industry at any time. However, once a reasonable estimate of the cost of labor and materials has been made, things should be done well. One should not "find tricks" to use up some odd materials, making them unrecognizable. If a set of works encounters "collective division of labor," with you mounting one and I mounting another, it is even more unimaginable; (3) In order to strive to overfulfill the business targets (monthly or quarterly), paintings are not allowed to stay on the wall for too long. As long as they can be torn off without breaking, they are torn off and processed immediately. Some even skip the extremely important process of "small backing," with the aim of expanding the "use value" of the wall and shortening the working hours. How can this not result in "unironed shirts"?
    The above refers to new paintings. If you want to remount a few old items, the danger is even greater. Unless one has a spirit of sacrifice, no one dares to take on the task. On the other hand, after collectivization, some responsible comrades (or public representatives) have long seen through that doing these things is a difficult, time-consuming, and material-consuming business that does not yield good results. They simply refuse to accept them or deliberately make it impossible for people to do them. For example, Chen Helin of Nantong is sixty years old, and his "row brush" (the only tool of a painting mounter) has been used for decades, with only a few sparse hairs left. What paintings can he mount? Another example is Xu Shihong of Zhenjiang, who, in addition to his good skills, is also good at identifying early and later rubbings of steles, which is originally a rare talent. Now he earns thirty yuan a month, and the leadership only allows him to do "red goods" and does not allow him to do "white goods."
    We believe that this situation urgently needs to be changed. We demand that the art of mounting, as an organic part of Chinese painting, must develop to a certain level accordingly. First of all, we must iron the "shirts" flat and smooth so that they "look good" when "worn." At the same time, in order to ensure that our rich heritage of paintings and calligraphy can be passed down forever, we must quickly rescue the already few "painting doctors," invite them out from all corners, especially from the collectivized (joint venture) teams. The heritage of paintings and calligraphy is the cultural wealth of the Chinese people and also the outstanding contribution of the Chinese people to world culture. Many of them, due to their age, inevitably have various ailments, whether mild or severe. If there are famous craftsmen, they can "bring spring to life with their hands." If they are entrusted to the wrong people or allowed to perish, then our responsibility in this generation will be too great.
    The matter is urgent! There is no need to talk too much about the reasons. I would like to put forward a few preliminary suggestions as follows:
    1. It is suggested that the relevant leading departments appropriately allow some local mounting shops with a history (including the original technicians) to operate independently, and, under unified leadership, consider their specialties, provide them with convenience, and assist in development.
    2. It is suggested that the relevant leading departments treat experienced and technically excellent members of the group differently from ordinary members. Pay special attention to the elderly and frail and mobilize young people to learn from them with an open mind.
    3. It is suggested that the relevant leading departments make contact, restore the production of essential materials such as silk, satin, and brocade, and quickly improve quality and ensure supply.
    4. It is suggested that the Palace Museum, museums (institutes) in various places, cultural management committees, the Artists Association, the Chinese Painting Academy, and other units establish mounting work groups according to needs, invite experienced master craftsmen with skills to carry out demonstrative work, which can gradually solve the needs of their own units and also train a group of successors, continuously improve and promote the art of mounting with excellent traditions.

    裱画难
    从“没有烫的衬衫”谈到抢救“画郎中”的问题
    傅抱石
    近来国画工作者普遍地遭遇到一个极其严重的问题，就是裱画问题。特别是各地美术组织或有关文化部门负责展览工作的同志，更是苦不胜言。不久之前在上海闭幕的第二届全国国画展览会的作品，大多数是北京装裱的，当我在上海参观的时候，就不禁想起在北京和几位朋友闲谈时，有一位主持这次展览工作的同志说过的一句话，他说：“唉！求爷爷，拜奶奶，结果尽是些‘没有烫的衬衫’”，这话一点也不过分。
    我又想起1953年冬，那时“安徽省博物馆筹备处”还在芜湖，我应邀去看看他们收藏的古画，真有些好东西令我至今不能去怀，更令我不能去怀的还是有不少的东西由于裱的太坏恐怕永远不得超生。当我打开一本绢本的元明杂画小册子时，碎片竟然随着乱飞，而每页的厚度却不下三层一百磅的木造纸。我曾急躁地大声指责过不自量力的裱画师，再四请求以后要请高明的
  “画郎中”，否则宁可不动它们。听说后来注意了这个问题。可是若干遭了殃的名画是回天无术的了。
    作为一件艺术品，除了画面的艺术水平决定在画家而外，装裱是最重要的一关。这关过的好，不但作品增色而且可以“延年益寿”；过的不好呢，就会使满意的作品大大为之减色，甚至从此受到不应有的摧残，惹上满身暗疾，一辈子不得健康。此中甘苦，几乎是所有的书画家，鉴藏家所深切体会到的。
    正因为如此，历代的书画家、鉴藏家就格外重视装裱工作，尤其是旧画，必须物色握有妙技的“良工”，不惜一切地打交道、拉关系，卑辞厚币，如待上宾。这样做，自然是为了艺术作品的艺术效果和艺术生命。我们知道，中国书画名迹，材料不外是纸、绢之类，而纸、绢的生命是需要特殊护理的。特别是旧迹，少则数十年，多则数百年甚至千年以上，它们的重裱，等于面临一次生死关头，完全决定于“医生”的技术和经验，古人说，“古迹重装，如病延医”（明周嘉胄：装璜志），是一点也不错的。高明的“医生”的确可以“起死回生”，而庸“医”则往往杀“人”，所以“装璜优劣，实名迹存亡系焉”（同上）。唐末五代以来，装裱渐盛，名手辈出，不少书画家还自己动起手来。褚河南裱过东晋顾恺之的“清夜游西园图”；米南宫一遇晋人妙迹，辄往往躬自裱背，“龟澼虽多手屡洗，卷不生毛谁似米？”（米芾：题太令帖）就证明了他对于此道的得意。大概书画装璜的形制，备于两宋，而装璜的艺术则发达于明代，淮海周嘉胄的“装璜志”，钱塘周二学的“赏延素心录”（清初），都是有关书画装裱的专著。由于自南宋特别自明初以来，书画家、收藏家多在江浙一隅，装璜高手，也多在这一带，而苏州是最大的据点之一。当时姓汤的和姓强的两家最为有名，号称“国手”，相传著名鉴藏家王世贞（弇州）为了装裱名作还向强家礼拜过。同时，南京有庄希淑（苏州人）者，特负绝技，也深为各方所宗仰。
    据故老相传，一位高手的产生，是非常不容易的，既要聪明，更要沉着，非有“面壁九年”之志，决不可尝试一幅古画，一纸上案，往往累月，不但手足要有规矩，连呼吸也要加以管制。因此，行业中有的对自己的儿子，也多不叫学这一行。一般说：他们除严格地要求工料外，重要的在于能够别季节、审气候，一幅当前，反复揣摹，然后相机动手。天气太燥不行，太湿又不行，一年中，九、十两个月是最好的季节，所谓“已凉天气未寒时”，这季节做的裱活，较其它季节好得多。老师傅常常谈：北京和广州都不是理想的工作地方，惟有长江下游，特别靠近上海的地区，气候格外适宜。我常想，“苏裱”的得名，不是偶然，是有它的历史原因、物质条件乃至自然环境的。
    不可否认，近代半殖民地社会影响无疑地反映在传统艺术的各个方面，书画装璜自不能例外。就我个人来说，过手的旧迹不多，体会不是很深，但自己的拙作和有关工作单位的一些画件，总是要过关或者要请“画郎中”的。回忆起来，“不如意事常八九”，但“过过去”也就算了，并不作任何长远的打算。因为，我了解今天的“此道不彰”，用不着强求。然而我也知道，确有不少难得的人才和有信誉的店家，如上海刘定之，周桂笙（1956年1月，曾列席全国政协二届二次会议），“清閟阁”；苏州曹仲卿，谢松全；扬州黄洞山；成都“诗婢家”；北京刘金涛。特别是上海的刘定之和周桂笙，他们的确具有“偷天换日”的本事。记得1953年底，我亲眼看到，徐平羽先生花一元五角（当时一万五千）在地摊上买得一幅李复堂的横幅，可恨的是有人加上了一只“乌鸦”似的鸟，通过刘定之，“乌鸦”飞掉了，这是一绝！刘海粟先生无意中买到了清初周亮工（著名鉴赏家）收藏的一部画册（这是“赖古堂”中一部精彩的重要的东西），据说不过是几个稀烂的纸团团，通过刘定之，一部完整如新的东西出现了，这应该又是一绝！
    按行业的术语说，他们这些“精裱古今名人字画”的，叫做干“白货”的，另外专门制作红白喜庆用的联、轴和各色纸板的，叫做干“红货”的。两者一切都不同，精粗太悬殊，可以说他们过去没有什么紧密的联系。
    解放初期，“红货”既不行，“白货”尤其惨。以南京为例，有的歇业，有的改行，还有不少连“生命线”的朱漆案板也当木柴卖掉了。到1953年第一届全国国画展览前后，“白货”开始获得了苏醒，生意渐渐好一些，然而还非做些（或者主要的做）“类似白货”的生意（如挂图、图片、糊房子等）不可。从那时起，挣扎过来的一些师傅，情绪是高的，对前途也很乐观。
    自1956年春初全部（红货和白货）合作化（有的合营）之后，问题却显得特别严重。据个人不很全面的了解和最近江苏省文化局、文联联合召开的全省国画工作者座谈会上不少国画家的反映和呼吁，普遍存在的有下面三种情况：（一）价钱比以前（合作前）贵得多，一般贵20％—50％；（二）质量比以前差得多。有的四幅一组的，竟裱成几种深浅不同的颜色，甚至同一幅的四边，颜色也深浅不同。（三）只要挂上一二天，的确都变成了“没有烫的衬衫”，凹凸不平。
    为什么会闹成这个样子呢？据了解，主要是：（一）合作化（合营）以后，不分技艺的高下，“一视同仁”，按件计值。少数具有几十年经验的老师傅和刚刚吃满“牙祭”的人“劳动竞赛”，你老了，做不动，做的少，“活该”。加上“公方代表”、“脱产干部”的开支，管理费重了（有的不加这一项），“羊毛出在羊身上”，加上材料也涨价，哪得不贵呢？如南京“渊海阁”合作初期，为某单位糊几间房子，七个人做了一天，各项加起来是四十三元，他们自己说：若在合作化之前，最多三十元就够了；（二）节约材料，任何时期任何行业都是应该的。可是一经合理地估计了工料价格，就要把东西做好，不应该再“找窍门”把一些零星材料用上去，弄的面目全非。成组的作品，若碰上“集体分工”，你一张、我一张地裱，那就更不堪设想了。（三）为了争取超额完成营业指标（月度或季度），画在壁面上是不许多停留的，只要撕下来不破，就撕下来立刻加工，有的连“小托”这道极关重要的工序也省掉，目的无非扩大壁面的“使用价值”和缩短工时；这样搞，还能不像“没有烫的衬衫”么？
    上面还是指的新画而言。若有几幅旧东西想重裱一下，那危险性就更大了。除非抱着牺牲精神是谁也不敢领教的。另一面，合作化以后，有的负责同志（或公方代表）早就看透了搞这些东西是吃力、费工、费料而又不讨好的买卖，干脆就拒绝接受或者故意让人干不了。如南通的陈鹤林，六十岁了，一支“排笔”（裱画师唯一的工具）用了几十年，只剩稀疏的几根毛了，还能裱什么画呢？又如镇江的徐世鸿，除了一手好手艺之外，还善于鉴别碑帖的初拓、二拓，这原是不可多得的人才，现在一月三十元，并且领导上只许干“红货”，不许干“白货”。
    我们认为这情况是迫切需要改变的。我们要求作为国画有机组成部分之一的装璜艺术，必须相应发展至一定的水平；首先要把“衬衫”烫的平平整整，“穿”起来才好看。同时更要求为了使我们丰富的书画遗产能永远流传下去，必须迅速地抢救已经寥寥的“画郎中”，从各个角落里请出来，特别从合作化（合营）了的队伍里请出来。书画遗产，是中国人民的文化财富，也是中国人民对世界文化的卓越贡献。其中不少由于年代久远了，难免有或轻或重的诸般病症，若有名工，可以“着手成春”，万一付托非人，或任其湮灭，那我们这一辈子的责任就太大了。
    事急矣！理由不要多谈。谨提出几点初步的建议如下：
    1、建议有关领导部门，适当地让一些地方有历史性的裱画店（包括原有的技工）独立经营，在统一领导之下，考虑它们的特长，给以便利，协助发展。
    2、建议有关领导部门，就组合的成员中把经验丰富技术优良的和一般的分别对待。特别对年老体衰的多多照顾，动员年青的虚心向他们学习。
    3、建议有关领导部门，进行联系，恢复绢、绫、锦等必须材料的生产，并迅速提高质量，保证供应。
    4、建议故宫、各地博物馆（院）、文管会、美协、国画院等单位，根据需要，成立装璜工作组，延请有技术有经验的老师傅，进行示范性的工作，既可逐渐解决本单位的需要，又可培养一批接班人，把具有优秀传统的装璜艺术，不断提高并发扬起来。
