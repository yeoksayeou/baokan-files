On the First Day of the Song and Dance Performance

Ye Lin

On the first day of the National Professional Troupe Music and Dance Performance, I watched the performances of the Shaanxi and Jiangsu provincial delegations.

I think this evening performance is very meaningful. Because, for the Beijing audience, all twelve dances performed this evening are new programs being staged in Beijing for the first time, which can give people great satisfaction; at the same time, for literary and art workers, this performance can also give people strong inspiration. There are many mature experiences in it, and it also provides some thought-provoking questions.

Shaanxi and Jiangsu are geographically far apart, and their local languages are also mutually unintelligible. It is very clever for the organizers of the evening to put the programs of these two regions together. There is a clear contrast between two different artistic styles. One is strong and bold, and the other is elegant and gentle. In contrast, the artistic characteristics of the programs in these two regions are more prominent, and the color of the entire evening is also very rich. From this, one cannot help but think of a question that everyone is closely concerned about, that is, how can song and dance groups in different regions and different conditions better cultivate and establish their own artistic styles and develop the individuality of the troupe. There was a time when the various professional song and dance troupes were still very young, and even the most basic repertoire had not been established. This question could not be raised too early. Especially in the past two years, in order to quickly meet the needs of the masses, song and dance troupes had to focus on exchanges and learning, and a nationwide situation of "three lights and one run" inevitably appeared. However, as far as the current situation is concerned, this situation has been basically overcome. On the one hand, we still acknowledge the necessity of exchanges and learning between various song and dance troupes and continue to promote some excellent programs; on the other hand, I think the current opportunity is ripe, and we should better consider the issue of cultivating and developing the style and personality of the troupe. The performances of the Shaanxi and Jiangsu provincial delegations have provided some gratifying practical experience in this regard. These two groups have established their own distinct artistic styles, and at the same time, in some aspects, especially the Xi'an People's Song and Dance Troupe, a certain artistic personality has been formed. This is something to be happy about.

Establishing the troupe's unique artistic style is, to a large extent, inseparable from the local folk song and dance art traditions. The local traditional song and dance programs and their unique artistic expression methods can often give the performances of the song and dance troupes in the region a special brilliance. Only through long-term research and study of the local traditional song and dance art, carrying forward these traditional song and dance arts, and inheriting these traditional song and dances and their artistic methods, can we establish an artistic style with local characteristics that is popular among the masses. It can be believed that the Shaanxi provincial delegation has been very firm in its learning in this regard, and their artistic style is firmly established on the basis of the Shaanxi North Yangko. These styles are so pure that whether in traditional programs or in the performance of creative programs, they are very unified, and it is difficult to find any impurities. The achievements of the Jiangsu Provincial Song and Dance Troupe in this regard are also significant. This troupe has only been established for about a year, but it has made good achievements in learning from folk traditional song and dance. It has sorted out four dances with Jiangnan temperament, among which "Duanlong" is the most wonderful. This dragon is danced by girls, which is also a big feature. This is completely the elegant style of the Jiangnan fish and rice land. Anyone who has lived in Jiangsu for a few years can feel the strong local flavor in these programs. The other program, "Flower Fragrance Drum Dance," is also like this. We know that other groups also have this program, and they are all taken from the same material. Although the other one also has different advantages, I always feel that this dance has more Jiangnan artistic temperament and is more like a Jiangsu dance. From these examples, I think it is still very necessary to continue to vigorously emphasize learning from folk traditional song and dance art and require our song and dance workers to continue to systematically and deeply explore and sort out traditional song and dance. This is good for promoting the vigorous development of folk song and dance art activities, and it is also good for cultivating the troupe's unique artistic style and enriching the repertoire.

In terms of sorting out and processing traditional programs and choreographing new programs, the achievements of the Xi'an People's Song and Dance Troupe are even more significant. They have several unforgettable dances, such as "Lazy Woman Snatching the Field," "Hunting Bear Dance," and "Flowers and Youth," each of which has new achievements. "Lazy Woman Snatching the Field" is a very lovely traditional dance. As a symbol of auspiciousness in the minds of farmers, the lion, and the lazy woman, although a little lazy, but very kind, the relationship between them contains very rich content. People regard the lion as the embodiment of happiness, and through it, they friendly satirize people's shortcomings and encourage people to correct their mistakes, indicating that auspiciousness and happiness are only often with those who are diligent. Such a theme can be expressed through such vivid artistic images, which cannot but be attributed to the wisdom of the working people and the re-creation of the comrades of the Xi'an People's Song and Dance Troupe.

It should be particularly pointed out that in the performance of these programs, I think there are always some very valuable things running through them, that is, these programs have a clear ideological content, a strong atmosphere of life, and a dramatic effect. These characteristics are the treasures of our folk dance, but not every song and dance troupe can easily achieve them. I found that the choreographers and actors of this troupe pay very much attention to the integrity of the characters (including humanized animals) and the logic of the development of these characters, and pay attention to the theme of the dance, so that each dance has a certain weight, so that the audience can leave some positive things in their minds after watching it. It is exciting to teach people during the performance, and it is thought-provoking after the performance. This advantage is worth cherishing.

For the performance of the Jiangsu Provincial Song and Dance Troupe, I must say that what they lack is exactly these things. Except for "Duanlong," I think the main shortcoming of the other dances is the lack of a clear theme. I don't know what it wants to tell the audience, so I always feel that the weight is very light and somewhat pale. The more obvious one is "Flower Fan Dance," which only leaves some combinations of collective dance scenes. There is a lack of a thread that can connect the entire dance. This shortcoming, I think, is most likely to occur when sorting out non-narrative classical dances. Some comrades extract the movements of certain classical dances to form a dance, considering more the scene and a concept of abstract beauty, and they are prone to produce some works without content. It should be said that this phenomenon is not uncommon, and it does not exist in only one troupe. Especially some younger troupes should pay more attention to it.

Here, we also think of such a question, that is, the pursuit of artistic originality should first be unified on the basis of ideological content. If you deviate from the ideological content and only pay attention to the style, the result is dangerous, and it is easy to produce formalism from this.

The performances of these two delegations have given us a lot of inspiration. The Jiangsu Provincial Song and Dance Troupe, which is less than one year old, has already dedicated the first batch of gifts in the dance field and created some valuable spiritual wealth. The work achievements of the Xi'an People's Song and Dance Troupe in recent years are also significant. We believe that they will become the backbone of developing local song and dance undertakings.

    在歌舞会演的第一天
    叶林
    在全国专业团体音乐舞蹈会演的第一天，我观摩了陕西省和江苏省代表团的演出。
    我觉得这个晚会是很有意义的。因为，对于北京的观众来说，这个晚会所演出的十二个舞蹈，全部是第一次在北京上演的新节目，能够给人以很大的满足；同时，对于文艺工作者来说，这一次演出又能给人以强烈的启发。这里面有着不少成熟的经验，同时又提供了一些具有启发意义的问题。
    陕西和江苏在地理上距离很远，在地方语言上也互不相通，晚会的组织者把这两个地区的节目组织在一起是非常聪明的。这里面有着两种不同艺术风格的节目的鲜明的对照，一种是刚健、豪迈，另一种是秀丽、温文，相形之下，使这两个地区节目的艺术特征显得更为突出，使整个晚会的色彩也显得十分丰富。从这里，不禁使人首先想到一个为大家所密切关心的问题，那就是不同地区不同条件的歌舞团体如何更好地培养与建立自己的艺术风格和发展剧团的个性的问题。曾经有过一个时候，当各个专业歌舞团体还在十分年幼的时期，连起码的保留节目都没有建立起来，这个问题是不可能过早地提出来的。特别是前两年，歌舞团为了必须迅速地满足群众的需要，不得不以交流学习为主，不可避免地出现过一个全国性的“三灯一跑”的局面。但是，在目前的情况说来，这种状况是基本上克服过来了。一方面，我们仍然承认各个歌舞团进行交流学习的必要性，继续推广一些优秀节目；而另一方面，我觉得目前的时机已经成熟，应该更好地考虑一下培养与发展剧团的风格与个性的问题。陕西和江苏省代表团的演出，在这方面已经提供了一些可喜的实践经验。这两个团体已经建立了各自的鲜明的艺术风格，同时，在某些方面，特别是西安人民歌舞剧团，已经形成了一定的艺术个性。这是值得我们高兴的。
    建立剧团的独特的艺术风格，在很大的程度上是和当地的民间歌舞艺术传统分不开的。当地的传统歌舞节目和它们的独特的艺术表现方法，常常可以给该地区的歌舞团体的演出赋予特殊的光彩。只有通过向当地的传统歌舞艺术长期的钻研和学习，发扬这些传统歌舞艺术，把这些传统歌舞和它们的艺术方法继承下来，才能够建立起为群众所喜闻乐见的具有地方色彩的艺术风格。陕西省代表团在这方面的学习可以相信是非常坚定的，他们的艺术风格牢固地建立在陕北秧歌的基础上。这些风格是那样地纯净，无论是在传统节目或是在创作节目的表演中，都是十分统一，很难找出有些什么杂质。江苏省歌舞团在这方面的成就也是显著的。这个团建团只有一年左右，可是在向民间传统歌舞学习方面却做出了很好的成绩，整理出了四个具有江南气质的舞蹈来，其中特别是“段龙”，最为精彩。这条龙是由女孩子来舞的，这也是一个很大的特色，这完全是江南鱼米之乡的秀丽风格，只要是在江苏住过几年的人，都可以在这些节目中感染到强烈的乡土的芬芳。另一个节目“花香鼓舞”也是如此。我们知道另外的团体也有这个节目，都是取自同一的素材。尽管另外的一个也有不同的优点，可是我始终感到这一个舞蹈更具有江南的艺术气质，更像是江苏的舞蹈。从这些例子看来，我认为今后继续大张旗鼓地强调向民间传统歌舞艺术学习，要求我们的歌舞工作者继续系统而深入地发掘、整理传统歌舞，仍然十分必要。这对于促使民间歌舞艺术活动的蓬勃开展有好处，对培养剧团的独特的艺术风格和丰富上演节目，也有好处。
    在整理、加工传统节目和编导新节目方面，西安人民歌舞剧团的成就是更为显著的。他们有几个令人难忘的舞蹈，像“懒婆娘抢场”、“猎熊舞”和“花儿与少年”等，每一个舞蹈都有新的成就。“懒婆娘抢场”是一个非常可爱的传统舞蹈，作为农民心目中吉祥的象征的狮子，和那个虽然有些懒惰但却十分善良的懒婆娘，他们之间的关系是蕴藏着很丰富的内容的。人们把狮子作为幸福的化身，又通过它来友好地嘲讽了人们的缺点，鼓励人们改正错误，说明吉祥与幸福只和那些勤劳的人常在。这样的主题思想能够通过如此生动的艺术形象表达出来，这不能不归功于劳动人民的智慧和西安人民歌舞剧团同志们的再创造。
    应该特别提出的是：在这些节目的演出中，我觉得这里面始终贯串着一些非常可贵的东西，那就是这些节目都有着明确的思想内容，强烈的生活气息和富有戏剧性的效果。这些特点是我们民间舞蹈的瑰宝，但却又并不是每个歌舞团都能轻易做到的。我发现这个剧团的编导和演员都非常注意到人（包括人化了的动物）的性格的完整性和这些性格的发展的逻辑性，注意到舞蹈的主题思想，使每个舞蹈都具有一定的分量，使观众看过了以后能够在脑子里留下一些积极的东西。在演出时教人兴奋，在演出后耐人寻味。这种优点是值得我们珍惜的。
    对于江苏省歌舞团的演出，不能不说，他们比较缺乏的恰好就是这些东西。除了“段龙”以外，其它的一些舞蹈我觉得主要的缺点就是缺乏明确的主题，不知道它要告诉观众的到底是一些什么，因而始终感到分量很轻，多少带有一些苍白。其中比较明显的是“花扇舞”，就只剩下一些集体舞蹈场面的组合，这里面缺乏一条可以把整个舞蹈贯串起来的思想的线索。这种缺点，我觉得是在整理非情节性的古典舞蹈时最容易出现的。有些同志把某些古典舞蹈的动作抽取出来组成一个舞蹈，更多地考虑到场面和一种抽象的美的概念，往往容易产生出一些没有内容的作品。应该说，这种现象并不是不普遍的，也决不只在一个团体内存在着，特别是一些比较年幼的团体，更应引起注意。
    在这里，我们还联想到这样的一个问题，那就是：追求艺术上的独创性的风格，应该首先统一在思想内容的基础上。如果脱离开思想内容，只注意到风格，其结果是危险的，很容易由此而产生形式主义。
    这两个代表团的演出给我们的启发是很多的，还不到一周岁的江苏省歌舞团已经在舞蹈事业中献出了第一批礼物，创造出了一些珍贵的精神财富。西安人民歌舞剧团这些年来的工作成绩也是显著的。我们相信他们将会成为开展当地歌舞事业的中坚力量。
