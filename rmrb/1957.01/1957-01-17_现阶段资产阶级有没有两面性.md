Does the Bourgeoisie Still Have a Dual Character in the Present Stage?

The Shanghai Xinwen Ribao (News Daily) organized a discussion on this question. From November 14th to December 26th of last year, a total of more than twenty articles were published. The discussion has now ended. The majority of those participating in the discussion believe that the bourgeoisie still has a dual character at the present stage.

Those who advocate that there is no dual character believe that after the implementation of joint state-private ownership in all trades, the economic status of the national bourgeoisie has undergone fundamental changes, and it is no longer a complete class. Although they obtain a certain amount of fixed interest income due to the existence of private ownership of the means of production, this ownership is only nominal. In reality, capitalists have been separated from the means of production. They have lost the basis for exerting a negative influence. At the same time, under the leadership and supervision of the state, and having been subjected to socialist education for a long time, they have also undergone great changes in their thinking. In enterprises, they also participate in socialist competitions, and many people have also won the glorious title or reward of advanced workers. Although there are still a few private personnel engaging in corruption, bribery, and establishing underground factories, this can only be said to be a part of the contradiction between the advanced and the backward. We cannot regard the remnants of this old ideology as a manifestation of the dual character of the bourgeoisie.

Those who advocate that there is a dual character believe that the dual character is determined by China's historical conditions and the economic status of the national bourgeoisie. This is the characteristic of the Chinese national bourgeoisie and also the class nature of this class. Although it will have different content and forms of expression with the development of each stage of the Chinese people's revolution, it will inevitably continue to exist until this class is eliminated. After the implementation of joint state-private ownership in all trades, due to the changes in the original capitalist relations, the content of the dual character of the bourgeoisie has also undergone significant changes, and the positive side has become the main side. However, this is only one aspect of the problem. On the other hand, since the capitalist ownership of the means of production has not been finally eliminated, the negative side of the bourgeoisie still exists. The negative side of the dual character of the bourgeoisie at the present stage is specifically manifested in: not caring about the accumulation of the state and enterprises, some people engaging in socialism during the day and capitalism at night, establishing underground factories, privately selling products, evading taxes, embezzling public funds, stealing raw materials, engaging in speculative trading, and exploiting loopholes in the free market. They do not attach importance to product quality and reducing costs, and some pass off inferior goods as good ones; in public-private relations, they do not actively support the public side, and some even use backward workers to provoke relations between workers and the public side, etc. These facts are, in essence, the specific manifestations of the bourgeoisie's ideas of reaping without sowing, prioritizing profit, and benefiting oneself at the expense of others under the new conditions. Judging from these facts, the negativity of the national bourgeoisie at the present stage is not merely a matter of ideology, but rather various behaviors and activities that are detrimental to the cause of socialist construction. Therefore, it is wrong to regard the current reflection of the negative side of the national bourgeoisie as a contradiction between the advanced and the backward. The latter is the ideological remnant after the elimination of the bourgeoisie, while the dual character of the national bourgeoisie at the present stage is determined by the class nature of the bourgeoisie.

### 现阶段资产阶级有没有两面性

    现阶段资产阶级有没有两面性
    现阶段资产阶级有没有两面性？上海新闻日报就这问题组织了讨论。自去年11月14日到12月26日，一共发表了二十多篇讨论的文章。现在，讨论已经结束。参加讨论的大多数人，都认为现阶段的资产阶级仍有两面性。
    主张没有两面性的人认为，在全行业实行公私合营以后，民族资产阶级的经济地位已经起了根本的变化，它已不是一个完整的阶级了。虽然由于生产资料私人所有权的存在而获得一定的定息收入，但是这种所有权，只是名义上的存在。实际上，资本家已和生产资料脱离了关系。他们已经失去了发挥消极作用的基础。同时，他们在国家的领导和监督下，长期以来受着社会主义的教育，在思想方面也大有转变。在企业里，他们也参加了社会主义竞赛，许多人还获得了先进工作者的光荣称号或奖励。虽然目前还有少数私方人员有贪污舞弊和私设地下工厂等行为发生，但这只能说是先进和落后之间矛盾的一部分。不能把这种旧意识的残余，说成是资产阶级两面性的表现。
    主张有两面性的人则认为，两面性是中国历史条件和民族资产阶级经济地位所决定的，这是中国民族资产阶级的特点，也是这个阶级的阶级性。虽然它随着中国人民革命的各阶段的发展会有其不同的内容和表现形式，但是，在这个阶级消灭以前，它就必然继续存在。全行业实行公私合营以后，由于原来的资本主义关系的变化，资产阶级两面性的内容也就有了重大的变化，积极的一面，已成了主要的一面。但是，这只是问题的一方面。另方面，由于生产资料的资本主义所有制还没有最后消灭，所以，资产阶级的消极一面，也还是存在的。现阶段资产阶级两面性的消极一面，具体表现在：不关心国家和企业的积累，有些人白天搞社会主义、晚上搞资本主义，私设地下工厂、私销产品、偷税漏税、贪污公款、盗用原材料、买空卖空、钻自由市场的空子。不重视产品质量和降低成本，有的以次货冒充好货；在公私关系上不积极支持公方，有些人甚至利用落后工人，挑拨工人和公方的关系，等等。这些事实，在本质上就是资产阶级的不劳而获、唯利是图、损人利己等思想意识在新条件下的具体表现。从这些事实看来，现阶段资产阶级的消极性并不仅仅是思想意识问题，而是种种不利于社会主义建设事业的行为和活动。所以，把目前民族资产阶级消极面的反映，说成是先进和落后的矛盾，是错误的。后者是资产阶级消灭以后的思想残余，而现阶段的民族资产阶级的两面性，则是资产阶级的阶级本性所决定的。
