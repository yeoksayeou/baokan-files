Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 13th: The Polish Press Agency reports on the growing Sino-Polish cultural cooperation, stating that cultural collaboration between Poland and China began approximately six years ago. Poland has hosted several renowned Chinese artistic groups, such as the 140-member Chinese Song and Dance Ensemble, the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe, the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe, and puppet and shadow play troupes, as well as many famous soloists.

    Chinese films are very popular with Polish audiences, who are particularly interested in "The White Haired Girl." In 1955, a Chinese Film Festival was held in Poland, during which a delegation of Chinese film workers visited Poland.

    新华社华沙13日电　波兰通讯社报道日益发展的中波文化合作的情况说，波兰和中国之间的文化合作是从大约六年前开始的。波兰曾经招待过一些著名的中国文艺工作团，如由一百四十人组成的中国歌舞团、中国京剧团、中国人民解放军歌舞团、中国杂技团、木偶戏和皮影戏团以及许多著名的独唱家。
    波兰举办过许多中国的展览会，其中有新中国展览会、中国古今艺术展览会、中国年画展览会、中国手工艺展览会、中国水彩画和剪纸展览会。参加过这些展览会的观众共计二百多万人。
    1953年，波兰响应世界和平理事会的号召，纪念了伟大的中国诗人屈原逝世两千二百周年。此外还有许多中国科学家、艺术家、作家和记者访问过波兰。
    中国电影很受波兰观众的欢迎，他们特别对“白毛女”感到兴趣。1955年，在波兰举行了中国电影节，当时中国电影工作者代表团访问了波兰。
    在文学方面，波兰的读者们从中国的古典文学和现代文学作品中了解了中国的文学传统。这些作品包括有庄子、屈原、鲁迅、老舍等人的作品，以及茅盾的小说“子夜”。
    另一方面，在过去几年里，波兰玛佐夫舍歌舞团和波兰军队歌舞团以及许多波兰歌唱家、钢琴家、作家、艺术家、建筑师等等，都曾经访问了中国。波兰作家们写过一些关于中国的书籍。其中有耶尔季·尤特腊门次的“中国札记”，亚当·阿埃斯克的“我看到了中国”，埃乌克罗夫斯基的“彩牌楼”以及雅努什·普希曼诺夫斯基的“中国”等。波兰还在中国办过一些现代艺术和民间艺术、音乐出版物、波兰剪纸和艺术摄影的展览会。成千成万的中国观众看过了波兰的电影“最后的阶段”、“萧邦的青年时代”、“最初的日子”等等。
