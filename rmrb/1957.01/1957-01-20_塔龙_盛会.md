    "That Luang" Festival
    By Our Correspondent Zhan Chao

    This first visit to Laos coincided with the annual "That Luang" festival.

    "That Luang," a building considered one of the wonders of Laos, stands tall in the northern part of Vientiane. It was built in 1566 by King Sai Setthathirath of Lan Xang.

    There are several Buddhist legends about "That Luang." One legend is that a hair of the Buddha Sakyamuni is deeply buried under this monument-like building; another legend is that a piece of Buddha's bone is buried below; still another story is that the Buddha stayed at the place where the stupa was built. Therefore, "That Luang" is a very sacred place in the hearts of the Lao people. The annual gathering around this building, like our Chinese "temple fair," is also the largest of all festivals in Laos.

    The "That Luang" festival usually lasts for three days. But it is lively even before the festival. People from all over the country come to display their local products and specialties in the cloisters of "That Luang." Visitors can purchase them on the spot, but they can only pick up their goods after the festival. This year's "That Luang" festival is particularly grand, and the exhibition halls from all over the country are set up in temporary buildings on the square in front of "That Luang." The United States, Britain, France, Thailand, West Germany, South Vietnam, and Japan also participated in the exhibition, advertising themselves heavily at the meeting. The Americans even built a shed to promote Christianity. Opposite the exhibition area are many temporary shops, food stalls, and small vendors; further on, near the outer wall of the "That Luang" cloister, is a row of temporary gambling stalls. Several round stages built of wood are scattered everywhere. There are also several small theaters, temporarily enclosed with tents, planks, or iron sheets. One of them is performing a story of gods and ghosts, another is a five-year-old and a three-year-old child playing with a large python and a small tiger, and the third is singing a famous epic. The male and female actors are all dressed in costumes, entering and exiting in sequence, but with very little movement, mainly relying on chanting to convey the plot of the story. During the performance, the audience can freely express their feelings. For example, when a male actor is chanting a section of the epic in a low voice, someone in the audience suddenly says loudly: "How sad he sings, women should shed tears for such misfortunes!" At this time, the atmosphere on and off the stage seems to be even more integrated. The performance continues until the end.

    Three days before the "That Luang" festival, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom government presides over the ribbon-cutting ceremony. On this day, all the ministers, senior officials, and foreign envoys are present, and the various exhibition halls also begin to operate, but this can only be regarded as a prelude. The official "That Luang" festival must be started by the King on the 13th day of the Lao lunar month of December (in the past two years the King has been ill and the Crown Prince has taken over). During the festival, the whole country is on holiday for three days. On the first day, early in the morning, the Prime Minister and all the ministers gather at the Royal Temple "Wat Ong Teu" in Vientiane, and the King or Crown Prince leads them to drink a cup of clear water one by one, to express their loyalty to the Kingdom and their integrity in public service; then, at about eight o'clock, led by the King or Crown Prince, they walk from "Wat Ong Teu" all the way to "That Luang"; after burning incense, lighting candles, and bowing in worship, the King or Crown Prince personally pins medals on the chests of meritorious officials under "That Luang"; then various sports competitions begin. The sports popular in Laos are horse racing, golf, boxing, football, badminton, etc. It is said that there used to be a national form of sport called hand-tied wrestling.

    During the festival, it is really lively. The population of Vientiane suddenly increases a lot, and crowds gather in front of "That Luang" day and night, joyfully celebrating this grand festival. Especially at night, the bright electric lights and dim candlelight outline the entire silhouette of "That Luang," making it look very beautiful. At this time, Lao young men and women step to the melodious music and dance graceful national dances on the round stage; there are also many young people who sit for a long time next to the small stalls set up by the girls, eating some grilled meat or something else. They talk softly under the small oil lamps, and once both parties are in agreement, they agree on a place to meet later, and it is almost always at the girl's house.

    Walking in from the gate, "That Luang" is filled with a mixture of sandalwood and candle scent. Here is another world, which seems very quiet and solemn. At this time, there are very few people worshiping and fortune-telling. The monks wearing yellow robes, except for those on night duty, are sleeping on mats spread on the floor of the cloister. Several local friends and I climbed up the steps of the three-story square base of "That Luang" and looked up at the round stupa standing upright from the middle. The shape and size of this stupa is very similar to the White Pagoda in Beihai Park in Beijing, except that it is golden and surrounded by thirty small stupas. This place is called "Lokachulamani," which means "the spine of the world."

    The "That Luang" we see now was restored in 1930. This historical building has suffered several degrees of damage in its nearly four-hundred-year history, but the final restoration is not very different from its original shape. This can be proved from many works.

    The Lao people not only built "That Luang," but also created many other magnificent buildings, some of which are still preserved in Luang Prabang, Pakse, and Savannakhet. All of these buildings are closely related to Buddhist culture.

    Buddhism is the state religion of the Kingdom of Laos. During the "That Luang" festival, I had the opportunity to meet the Deputy Supreme Patriarch of the country and learned a lot of knowledge from him. According to the Deputy Supreme Patriarch, there are now more than a thousand temples and twelve thousand monks in Laos; every Lao man must become a monk once in his life, especially before he gets married and starts a career. During the monkhood, he must abide by many precepts, learn diligence (chanting scriptures at 4 a.m. and 6 p.m. every day), rules (eating at 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. every day, and not eating after that), hygiene (shaving his head every half month, washing regularly), etc. The monkhood lasts from a week to several years. Before becoming a monk, he must obtain the consent of the abbot of a temple or a higher level, and then bring his own yellow robe to the temple. After completing the practice, he leaves the robe and obtains a diploma before returning home. During the monkhood, it is actually equivalent to going to school. For example, there are now three monk schools in Vientiane, and more than eight hundred of the one thousand two hundred monks are studying there. There are many courses to learn, and recently even a new course has been added - English.

    In order to manage Buddhist affairs, there is a vertical system from top to bottom throughout the country. The highest is the Supreme Patriarch and the Deputy Supreme Patriarch, who are selected and appointed by the King; below them are various departments assisting the Supreme Patriarch in presiding over national religious affairs; at the local level, there are provincial, municipal, and county-level organizations; below that are the temples, but there are differences between large and small temples, and the organization is very complete. Many government officials consult the Buddhist system first when something happens. Buddhism has a very high status in Laos. If eating at the same time, government officials must let the monks eat first. All monks are automatically supported by the residents. In Vientiane, every morning you can see many people sending freshly cooked sticky rice and other food to various temples. In addition, processions with Buddhist flags often appear on the streets (these processions are often composed of several cars), which is a religious ritual that every family must hold once a year. People put the best things on a gorgeous shelf and hang strings of paper money on it and send it to a specific temple. They do nothing else those days to show their piety.

    There are two systems of Buddhism in Laos. The one mentioned above belongs to the "Maha Nikaya" sect; the other is the "Thammarut" sect, which has only one or two hundred people in the whole country. They practice in the deep mountains and dense forests and have little influence on the overall political and cultural life. (Attached picture)

### “塔龙”盛会

    “塔龙”盛会
    本报记者　展潮
    这次初访老挝，恰巧遇到一年一度的“塔龙”盛会。
    “塔龙”，这座被视为老挝的奇迹之一的建筑物，高高地矗立在万象市区的北部。它是在公元1566年，由澜沧国王赛·塞塔堤勒兴建的。
    关于“塔龙”，有好些关于佛教的传说。一种传说是这座纪念碑似的建筑物下面，深深地埋藏着释迦牟尼佛的一根头发；另一种传说是下面埋着一块佛骨；还有一种说法是佛曾在建塔的地方停留过。因此，“塔龙”在老挝人民心目中是非常神圣的地方。围绕这座建筑物每年举行一次仿佛我们中国“庙会”一样的大会，也是老挝全国所有节日里最大的一次。
    “塔龙”大会会期一般是三天。但是在大会前就很热闹了。全国各地都有人赶来，他们在“塔龙”的回廊里陈列自己地方上的土产和特产，参观的人可以当场认购但须在会后才能取货。这次“塔龙”会规模特别盛大，各地的展览馆都设在“塔龙”前面那片广场上的临时建筑物里。美国、英国、法国、泰国、西德、南越以及日本也参加展出，在会上大做其广告，美国人还特别搭了个棚子宣传基督教。在展览区的对面是许多临时商店、饮食铺和小摊；再过去，靠近“塔龙”回廊墙外，是一列临时赌摊。有几座用木头搭起来的圆形大舞台，夹杂在各处。还有几处小戏院，也是临时用帐篷、木板或者铁皮围起来的。其中一处在演神鬼的故事，另一处是一个五岁和一个三岁的小孩正跟一条大蟒蛇和一只小老虎耍把戏，第三处正在演唱一部有名的史诗。男女演员们都穿着戏装，顺序出入，但是却很少动作，主要是靠唱诵来传达故事的情节。在演唱过程中观众也可以随便发抒自己的感情。例如正当一个男演员用低沉的声音唱诵史诗中的某一段时，突然观众里有一个人高声地说：“他唱得多么悲哀啊，女人应该为这种不幸的遭遇流泪！”这时台上台下的空气似乎更融成一片了。演唱一直继续到终场。
    在“塔龙”会期前三天，由王国政府首相主持剪彩仪式。这一天所有的大臣、高级官员和外国使节们都到场，各个展览馆等也开始活动，但是这只能算是序幕，而正式的“塔龙”大会必须是在寮历12月13日由国王主持下开始（这两年国王患病，由太子代替主持）。大会期间，全国上下一律放假三天。第一天清晨，首相和各部大臣都齐集在万象市区的皇家庙宇“瓦翁第”里，由国王或太子率领逐个喝一杯清水，表示矢忠王国和廉洁奉公；随后，大约在八时左右，由国王或太子为前导，从“瓦翁第”一直步行到“塔龙”跟前；在烧香燃烛顶礼之后，国王或太子便在“塔龙”下亲自把勋章逐个地缀在功臣们的胸前；然后各种体育比赛活动开始了。在老挝比较盛行的运动项目有赛马、高尔夫球、拳击、足球、羽毛球等，听说过去还有一种绑手摔跤的民族形式的运动。
    大会期间，真是热闹极了。万象人口突然增加了许多，“塔龙”前面日夜聚集着人群，热热闹闹地在欢度着这个盛大的节日。尤其是夜间，明亮的电灯和昏黄的烛光把“塔龙”整个轮廓都勾划出来，显得非常之美。这时候，老挝的男女青年们踏着悠扬的乐曲，在圆形的舞台上跳起优美的民族舞；还有许多青年长时间地坐在少女们摆的小摊旁边，吃点烤肉或者别的什么东西，他们在小小的油灯下轻声细语地谈话，一旦双方情投意合了，便互相约定以后见面的地方，并且几乎都是在女方家里。
    从大门走进去，“塔龙”里面充满着一片檀香和蜡烛混合起来的气味。这里却又是另外一个天地，显得十分幽静、肃穆。这时候参拜和占卜的人已经很少了，披着黄袈裟的和尚除了值夜的以外，都在回廊的地板上铺了张席子睡觉。我和当地的几位朋友沿着“塔龙”的三层方座的阶梯爬上去，仰望那从中间挺立起来的圆形大塔，这个塔的形状和大小很有点像北京北海的白塔，只不过它是金色的，而且周围有三十个小塔围绕着。这个地方被称为“罗卡舒拉玛尼”就是“世界之脊”的意思。
    我们现在看到的“塔龙”，是在1930年重新恢复起来的。这座历史性建筑物在它近四百年的历史中，曾经遭受到几次不同程度的破坏，但是最后恢复起来和它当初的形状可说没有很大的差别。这点可以从许多著作里得到证明。
    老挝人民不仅修成一座“塔龙”，而且还创造了其他许多宏伟的建筑物，有些今天还保存在琅勃剌邦、巴色和沙湾拿吉等地，而所有这些建筑都是和佛教文化息息相关的。
    佛教是老挝王国的国教。在“塔龙”盛会期间，我曾经有机会谒见这个国家的副僧王，并且从他那里学到不少知识。据副僧王说，现在老挝共有一千多座庙宇、一万二千名和尚；每个老挝男子一生中必须剃度一次，尤其是在他成家立业之前。在剃度期间必须遵守许多戒律，学会勤谨（每天早四时、晚六时诵经）、规则（每天早八时、午十一时进餐，过时不得吃）、卫生（每半月剃一次头，经常洗涤）等等。剃度从一周到几年，剃度前必须取得某个庙宇主持或更高一级的同意，然后自带黄布袈裟入庙，修成后把袈裟留下并取得文凭后始能回家。在剃度期间，实际上等于入学。例如：万象现在有三座和尚学校，一千二百名和尚就有八百多名在那里学习。学的课程很多，最近甚至还增加一个新的课程——英文。
    为了管理佛教事务，全国自上而下有一个垂直的系统，最高是僧王和副僧王，由国王选封；下面设有各部襄助僧王主持全国教务；地方上则有省、市、县等级机构；再下就是庙宇了，但是大、小庙宇又有所不同，组织很完整。许多政府官员有事还先向佛教系统咨询。佛教在老挝的地位极高，如果同时吃饭，政府官员必须让和尚先吃。所有和尚全由居民自动供养，在万象每天早晨都可以看见许多人把新煮熟的糯米饭等食物送到各个庙宇去。此外街上还常出现打着佛教旗帜的行列（这些行列往往是由几辆汽车组成），那是每个家庭每年都要举行一次的一种宗教仪式，人们把最好的东西放在一个华丽的架子上，并且挂上一串串纸币，送到特定的庙宇里去。那几天别的什么事都不做，以表示虔诚。
    老挝的佛教有两个系统，上面所说的是属“玛哈呢该”派；另一是“探玛如特”派，全国只有一、二百人，他们在深山密林中修炼，对整个政治和文化生活影响很少。（附图片）
