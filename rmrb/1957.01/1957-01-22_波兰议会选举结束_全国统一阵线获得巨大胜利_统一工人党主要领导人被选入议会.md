Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 21st: The polling for the Polish parliamentary elections concluded at 10 PM on January 20th. Preliminary statistics indicate that over 90% of the approximately 18 million voters nationwide participated.

After the voting, the chairpersons of the election committees in all electoral districts across Poland, in the presence of committee members and poll watchers designated by various political parties and social organizations, opened the more than 16,000 ballot boxes throughout Poland. The vote counting then commenced.

According to preliminary, unofficial materials from the various election committees, the main leaders of the Polish United Workers' Party, the United People's Party, and the Democratic Party have been elected to Parliament by an absolute majority of votes.

The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Gomulka; the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Cyrankiewicz; and members of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the United Workers' Party, Jędrychowski, Loga-Sowiński, Morawski, Ochab, Rapacki, Zambrowski, and Zawadzki, as well as Secretaries of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the United Workers' Party, Albrecht, Gierek, Jarosiński, and Matuszewki, have all been elected to Parliament.

The Chairman of the Central Committee of the United People's Party, Ignar; the Vice-Chairman, Wicech; and members of the Presidium of the Central Committee, Ozga-Michalski, have also been elected as members of Parliament.

The Chairman of the Central Committee of the Democratic Party, Kulczyński; the General Secretary, Hain; and the Vice-Chairmen, Jodłowski and Lechowicz, have also been elected as members of Parliament.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 21st: Preliminary results of the Polish parliamentary elections indicate that the Polish National Unity Front has achieved a great victory in the election. News from the various provinces indicates that the vast majority of voters responded to the call of the National Unity Front and Comrade Gomulka by not crossing out any candidate's name on the ballot. This means that the vast majority of voters voted for the main candidates of the National Unity Front.

According to preliminary election results calculated today from certain electoral districts, the leaders of the Polish United Workers' Party are far ahead in the counted ballots. In the third electoral district on the right bank of Warsaw, 25% of the sub-districts have counted their ballots, and the voter participation rate is as high as 95.25%. The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Gomulka, received the most votes in this district, accounting for 99.5% of the ballots already counted.

According to Polish election law, each electoral district can elect three members of Parliament from five candidates, five members of Parliament from eight candidates, or six members of Parliament from nine candidates, depending on the number of residents. If a candidate's name is not crossed out on the ballot, it is equivalent to electing the first three, first five, or first six names on the candidate list. United Workers' Party members account for more than 52% of these top three, top five, or top six candidates.

Based on the preliminary election results announced in some electoral districts in various provinces, no one has been found to have lost the election among the top three, top five, or top six names on the candidate list. That is to say, in the electoral districts where preliminary results have been announced, the top three, top five, or top six names on the candidate list have all been elected. Many Polish comrades believe this is an unexpected victory. This shows how much the people trust and support the working class party that wholeheartedly serves the people - the Polish United Workers' Party.

The National Unity Front Election Committee will officially announce the national election results on the 23rd.

    波兰议会选举结束
    全国统一阵线获得巨大胜利
    统一工人党主要领导人被选入议会
    据新华社华沙21日电　波兰议会选举的投票到20日晚十时止已经结束。据初步统计，全国一千八百万左右选民的90％以上都参加了投票。
    投票结束后，全国各选区选举委员会主席当着委员会委员和各政党社会团体指定的监票人的面，开启了全波兰各地的一万六千多个票箱。计票工作随即开始。
    根据各选举委员会初步的非正式材料，波兰统一工人党、统一农民党和民主党的主要领导人已经以绝对多数的选票被选入议会。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡，部长会议主席西伦凯维兹，统一工人党中央委员会政治局委员英德里霍夫斯基、洛加—索文斯基、莫拉夫斯基、奥哈布、拉帕茨基、萨姆布罗夫斯基和萨瓦茨基，统一工人党中央委员会书记处书记阿尔布列赫特、格雷克、雅罗辛斯基、马特温等都被选入议会。
    统一农民党中央委员会主席伊格纳尔、副主席维策赫、中央委员会主席团委员奥兹加—密哈尔斯基等也当选为议员。
    民主党中央委员会主席库尔钦斯基、总书记哈因、副主席约德洛夫斯基和列霍维奇也当选为议员。
    新华社华沙21日电　波兰议会选举的初步结果表明，波兰全国统一阵线已经在选举中获得巨大的胜利。从各省来的消息说明，绝大多数的选民在投票时都响应了全国统一阵线和哥穆尔卡同志的号召，在投票时不划掉一个候选人的名字，这就是说，绝大多数选民投了全国统一阵线主要候选人的票。
    根据某些选区今天计算出来的初步选举结果，波兰统一工人党的领导人在已经计算出来的选票结果中都遥遥领先。华沙右岸地区第三选区已经有25％的分选区计了票，参加选举的选民比例高达95.25％。波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡在这个选区得票最多，占已经计算的选票中的99.5％。
    按波兰选举法规定，各选区按居民数目可以从五个候选人中选出三个议员、或从八个候选人中选出五个议员、或从九个候选人中选出六个议员。假如选票上未划掉一个候选人的姓名，那就等于候选名单上的前三名或前五名或前六名当选了。在这前三名、前五名或前六名候选人中，统一工人党党员占52％以上。
    根据各省一些选区初步揭晓的选举结果，还没有发现候选名单上的前三名、前五名或前六名中有人落选，也就是说在已经初步揭晓的选区中，候选名单上的前三名、前五名或前六名都当选了。许多波兰同志都认为这是他们没有料到的胜利。这说明人民是如何信任和拥护忠心为人民服务的工人阶级的政党——波兰统一工人党。
    全国统一阵线选举委员会将在23日正式公布全国的选举结果。
