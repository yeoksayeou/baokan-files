Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, 28th — Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their entourage arrived in Lalitpur on the 27th. Lalitpur means "City of Beauty," and the Chinese guests found it to be truly worthy of the name.

The guests' cars traveled along the narrow, cobbled streets of the city, passing through crowds that were almost impassable, arriving at the most beautiful center of Nepal, Durbar Square, at around 10 a.m. By this time, Premier Zhou Enlai's car had turned red, as the welcoming people had sprinkled it with a thick layer of vermilion powder.

When Zhou Enlai and He Long ascended the platform, they received a warm welcome from the chairman of the Lalitpur municipal organization and the masses. The platform was built on Durbar Square, surrounded by pagodas and temples with double or triple eaves. The Krishna Temple, famous for its stone carvings, was nearby. These buildings are typical Nepalese architecture.

Premier Zhou Enlai was adorned with garlands. He said to the welcoming people: "Your indescribably warm welcome has deeply moved all of us. This scene will forever remain in our memories. I wish the Kingdom of Nepal prosperity, the Nepalese people happiness, and long live Sino-Nepalese friendship!" He concluded by shouting "Nepali Chini Bhai Bhai!" (Nepalese and Chinese are brothers) in Nepalese, which elicited thunderous applause.

The Premier exchanged gifts with the chairman of the municipal organization. The gifts from the host included a model of the Krishna Temple and a sandalwood box carved with patterns.

The Chinese guests then visited the palace of the King of Lalitpur, built three hundred years ago. Premier Zhou Enlai, on the upper floor of the palace, waved to the crowd gathered outside from the famous golden window decorated with Hindu deities. Until now, only emperors were allowed to open this window to look out.

While visiting the Gandhi Memorial Foundation nearby, the Premier donated 20,000 Nepalese Rupees to the fund. This foundation helps people engage in hand weaving.

To bid farewell to King Mahendra, who was leaving for an inspection visit to eastern Nepal, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long interrupted their sightseeing and also participated in the farewell ceremony at Tudikhel Square.

During their continued visit, they visited the rural industrial center, which is the center for handicraftsmen engaged in weaving, carpet making, pottery, sock weaving, and other industries. Zhou Enlai said to the hundreds of trainees and staff gathered in the large square, "From the beautiful and exquisite products of your handicrafts, we can see the high wisdom and genius of the Nepalese people, and we can see that the government of the Kingdom of Nepal is working hard to promote national handicrafts."

Zhou Enlai and He Long accepted the products of this center that were presented to them. The Premier said, "We will keep these things as a permanent souvenir of the Nepalese people and convey the friendship of the Nepalese people to the Chinese people."

Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, 28th — Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long met with the people of Bhaktapur this morning in the solemn and magnificent Durbar Square, six miles from the city of Bhaktapur. At that time, doves flew, flags fluttered, and songs and slogans resounded through the clouds.

The Chinese guests were welcomed into the beautifully constructed palace with roofs decorated with gold and silver threads. They wore black Bhaktapur hats and garlands. The temples, pavilions, and pagodas around this ancient palace looked very magnificent against the azure sky. People from the entire city and nearby villages seemed to have come. They crowded the entire square, the open spaces between the steps, and the high places of nearby buildings. Many people waved the national flags of Nepal and China in their hands.

Premier Zhou Enlai sat on a throne-like chair in the palace, facing the famous and magnificent golden gate and fifty-five elaborately carved windows of the former palace of the King of Bhaktapur. He was warmly welcomed by Ratna Sundar Sayenju, the chairman of the municipal organization of Bhaktapur.

Ratna Sundar Sayenju said: "In the current atmosphere of world tension, when terrible destructive weapons are being manufactured in scientific arsenals, and when Western countries have not abandoned their old policies, we warmly welcome Your Excellency's righteous actions to eradicate colonialism from the East and consolidate world peace on the sound basis of Panchsheel, which is full of the light of hope. We Nepalese will always be very grateful to your government, especially to Your Excellency, because your government has announced the provision of financial assistance to enable our country to smoothly implement the Five-Year Plan."

Premier Zhou Enlai expressed his gratitude for the warm welcome given by the Nepalese government and people and promised to strengthen the friendship and relations between the two peoples. He shouted: "Long live Sino-Nepalese friendship! Nepali Chini Bhai Bhai!" After exchanging gifts (Chinese and Nepalese handicrafts), Premier Zhou, Vice Premier He, and their entourage walked through the golden gate of the fourteenth-century palace, took off their shoes and everything made of leather, and visited the intricately built palace, admiring the artistic wood carvings, stone carvings, and architecture.

Later, they visited other historical sites in Bhaktapur, including the highest temple in the country—Nyatapola, which is a model of the Nepalese pagoda-style temple.

Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, 28th — Two rhinos will soon be transported from Kathmandu to the Beijing Zoo.

These two rhinos are part of the gift that King Mahendra of Nepal presented to Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long on the 26th. Preparations are now underway here to try to transport these two precious animals to Beijing.

Zhou Enlai and He Long presented Chinese handicrafts to King Mahendra and his two brothers, including cloisonné and jade carvings.

    周总理访问尼泊尔美丽的城市
    尼泊尔国王和我国总理互赠礼物
    新华社加德满都28日电　周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和随行人员在27日到达拉提土尔。拉提土尔的意思是美丽的城市，中国客人发现它真是名副其实。
    客人们的汽车沿着市内狭隘的石子路穿过了拥挤得几乎是无法穿过的人群，在上午十时左右到达尼泊尔的最美丽的中心杜尔巴广场。这个广场离加德满都两英里。这时候，周恩来总理所乘的汽车已经变成红色，因为欢迎的人们给它撒上了很厚的一层朱砂粉。
    周恩来和贺龙登上讲台的时候，受到了拉提土尔市政机构主席和群众的热情欢迎。讲台建筑在杜尔巴广场上，四周是一些宝塔和有双层或三层屋檐的一些庙宇。以石刻著名的克里希纳庙就在附近。这些建筑物都是典型的尼泊尔建筑。
    周恩来总理身上被戴满了花环。他向欢迎的人说：“你们的无法形容的热诚欢迎使我们大家都十分感动。这种情形将永远留在我们的记忆中。祝尼泊尔王国繁荣，祝尼泊尔人民幸福，中尼友好万岁！”他最后用尼泊尔语高呼“尼泊里秦尼巴伊巴伊！”（尼泊尔人和中国人是兄弟）引起了雷鸣般的掌声。
    总理同市政机构主席互赠了礼物。主人赠的礼物中有克里希纳庙的模型和雕有花纹的檀香木盒。
    中国客人然后参观了三百年前建筑的拉提土尔国王的宫殿。周恩来在宫殿的楼上，从饰有印度教神像的著名的金窗向聚集在外面的群众挥手。至今为止，只有帝王才准打开这个窗子向外观望。
    在参观附近的甘地纪念基金会的时候，总理捐赠了两万尼泊尔卢比作为基金。这个基金会帮助一些人从事手工纺织。
    为了欢送马亨德拉国王前往尼泊尔东部进行视察访问，周恩来总理和贺龙副总理中断了他们的观光，也在土迪克尔广场参加了欢送仪式。
    他们在继续进行访问的时候，参观了农村工业中心，这是从事纺织、织地毯、制陶器、织袜子等行业的手工业者的中心。周恩来对聚集在大场子里的几百名受训人员和工作人员说，“从你们的手工业的美丽精致的产品中，我们可以看到尼泊尔人民的高度智慧和天才，可以看到尼泊尔王国政府正在努力促进民族手工业。”
    周恩来和贺龙接受了赠给他们的这个中心的产品。总理说，“我们将把这些东西当作尼泊尔人民的永久纪念品保存起来，并且向中国人民转达尼泊尔人民的友情。”
    新华社加德满都28日电　周恩来总理、贺龙副总理今天上午在离巴克塔普尔城六英里的庄严华丽的杜尔巴广场上同巴克塔普尔的人民会面。当时，鸽子飞翔，旗帜飘扬，歌声和口号声响澈云霄。
    中国客人们被迎进了建筑华美的屋顶饰有金银线的宫殿。他们戴着黑色的巴克塔普尔帽子和花环。在这个历史古宫周围的庙宇、亭阁和宝塔在蔚蓝色的天空的衬托下显得非常壮丽。全城和附近村庄的人民似乎都来到了。他们挤满了整个广场、阶梯间的空地和附近建筑物的高处。很多人挥舞着手中的尼泊尔和中国两国国旗。
    周恩来总理坐在宫殿中的一张御座似的椅子上，对面就是巴克塔普尔国王故宫中著名的壮丽的金色大门和五十五扇精工雕刻的窗子。他受到了巴克塔普尔市的市政机构主席腊德纳·桑达尔·萨延朱热诚的欢迎。
    腊德纳·桑达尔·萨延朱说：“在当前世界紧张的气氛中，当可怖的毁灭性武器正在科学武库里制造的时候，当西方国家还没有抛弃旧政策的时候，我们热诚欢迎阁下采取的正义行动，把殖民主义从东方铲除掉，在充满着希望之光的潘查希拉的健全的基础上巩固世界和平。我们尼泊尔人永远非常感激贵国政府，特别是阁下，因为贵国政府宣布提供财政援助来使我国顺利地实现五年计划。”
    周恩来总理表示感谢尼泊尔政府和人民给予的热烈的欢迎，并且保证要加强两国人民之间的友谊和关系。他高呼：“中尼友谊万岁！尼泊里秦尼巴伊巴伊！”在互相赠送礼品（中国和尼泊尔工艺品）以后，周总理、贺副总理和随行人员走过十四世纪的宫殿的金门，脱掉了鞋子和所有用皮革做的东西，参观建筑得很复杂的宫殿，欣赏艺术的木刻、石刻和建
  筑。
    后来他们参观了巴克塔普尔的其他一些古迹，包括这个国家最高的庙宇——尼阿塔波拉，这个庙宇是尼泊尔宝塔式庙宇的典范。
    新华社加德满都28日电　过些时候将有两头犀牛从加德满都运到北京动物园。
    这两头犀牛是尼泊尔国王马亨德拉26日赠给周恩来总理和贺龙副总理的礼物的一部分。现在这里正在准备设法把这两只珍兽运往北京。
    周恩来和贺龙将中国工艺品赠给马亨德拉国王和他的两位兄弟，其中有景泰蓝和玉雕。
