Agricultural cooperatives' collective management holds immense potential.
Many high-yield records appear in Yunnan.

(Report from our newspaper in Kunming) Due to relying on the advantageous conditions of cooperative collective management and actively improving production techniques, in 1956, many high-yield records appeared in the rich Yunnan Province's agricultural production. This fact proves that Yunnan's land has enormous potential for increased production.

The Kunyang State Farm has eighty mu of rice paddy, with an average yield of over one thousand jin per mu, and the highest reaching one thousand three hundred and ninety-two jin. Shiqiao Agricultural Cooperative in Yangbi County created a record of 1,700 jin of rice per mu. The land of Xiagang Agricultural Cooperative by Erhai Lake is a fertile lacustrine soil. The highest wheat yield of this cooperative reached 1,090 jin per mu, and the general yield was also between 500-800 jin. In subtropical areas such as Lujiang and Yuanjiang, sugarcane grows very well, with the highest yield in Nujiang reaching more than 20,000 jin per mu; the highest sugarcane yield in the Yuanjiang State Farm reached 28,000 jin per mu. The peanuts at the WanDian Farm are full and plump, with a maximum yield of 842 jin per mu. The dry rice of Gaoyuan Agricultural Cooperative in Simao County reached a maximum yield of 1,157 jin. Among the 123 mu of broad beans planted by the Gongnong Agricultural Cooperative in Dengchuan County, four mu of high-yield land had a yield of up to 960 jin per mu. Binchuan, the main cotton-producing area of Yunnan Province, promoted the experience of high-yield Xinjiang cotton last year. Among the county's more than 62,000 mu of cotton fields, more than 10,000 mu had a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and the highest yield reached 283 jin per mu. The Xianfeng Cooperative in Luquan County (mountainous area) planted 37 mu of single-season corn, with an average yield of 1,240 jin per mu. The highest yield of potatoes in the Yuma Red Township Agricultural Cooperative in Luliang County, which is located in a high and cold mountainous area, also reached 4,500 jin per mu. The multi-leaf flue-cured tobacco of Songguan Township Agricultural Cooperative in Yuxi County grew so tall and strong that people had to stand on stools to pick the waist leaves. The cooperative planted a total of 82 mu of this multi-leaf tobacco, with an average yield of 750 jin of tobacco leaves per mu, and the highest yield reaching 1,300 jin per mu.
