Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: Premier Zhou Enlai received Edward Murrow of CBS in Rangoon on December 19, 1956, and answered some of the questions he raised. Premier Zhou Enlai's interview was broadcast on CBS television on December 30. The full text of the questions and answers is as follows:

Visiting Burma for a friendly visit

I. What is the purpose of your visit to Burma?

I came to Burma at the invitation of the Government of the Union of Burma and Prime Minister U Ba Swe for a friendly visit, to discuss issues of mutual interest to both countries and certain issues of international importance with the leaders of the Union of Burma, and to participate with the leaders of the Union of Burma in the China-Burma border people's conference held in Mangshi, Yunnan Province, China.

The call for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan is growing

II. Do you see any real prospect for a negotiated settlement of the Formosa issue?

First, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that in China, everyone, including the Chiang Kai-shek Group, uses the name "Taiwan" instead of "Formosa."

Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. Taiwan was returned to China after World War II. This was not only stipulated in international agreements, but also the procedures for returning Taiwan to China were carried out. All this has been acknowledged in official documents by the Truman administration.

The question now is how to strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and how to strive for the return of Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland by the Chiang Kai-shek Group.

The call for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and the return of Taiwan to the motherland is growing day by day, and is receiving more and more response within the Chiang Kai-shek Group. Therefore, the possibility of peaceful liberation of Taiwan is constantly increasing.

Restoring China's representation in the United Nations

III. What do you consider to be the main objections to admitting your government to the United Nations? Do you feel that many governments favor China's entry into the United Nations, but have not openly expressed this attitude due to American influence?

The issue now is not China's entry into the United Nations, but the restoration of China's representation in the United Nations. Currently, those occupying China's seat in the United Nations do not represent the government established by the 600 million Chinese people, but represent the group that was overthrown by the Chinese people for instigating the civil war. This situation is clearly in violation of the United Nations Charter.

At present, the countries in the United Nations that favor the restoration of China's legitimate representation, although not yet a majority in form, already represent more than half of the world's population. The fundamental reason why China's legitimate representation in the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council has not yet been restored lies in the influence of the United States on the United Nations. However, it is the United Nations itself that suffers the most under these circumstances. The organization of the United Nations should have universal representation. Without the representation of the 600 million Chinese people, the United Nations cannot play its due role in resolving international issues, especially in resolving Asian international issues.

Resolutely oppose the conspiracy to create "Two Chinas"

IV. Would you care to comment on the so-called "Two Chinas" policy?

There is only one China in the world, and there is only one Chinese government that can represent China, that is, the Government of the People's Republic of China. This is the will of the 600 million Chinese people. Any attempt to create a "Two Chinas" conspiracy will be resolutely opposed by all Chinese people.

The "Two Chinas" policy is actually a continuation of the policy of imperialist countries to split China and carry out subversive activities against China. Now these countries see that it is impossible to subvert the regime established by the Chinese people, so they are trying to create two Chinas. This is resolutely opposed by any Chinese, including the Chiang Kai-shek Group, as long as they have patriotism.

There is no Soviet intervention in Hungary at all

V. Would you care to comment on the recent events in Hungary?

The events in Hungary show that certain groups in Western countries used the Hungarian people's movement and dissatisfaction to carry out subversive activities against Hungary. This activity was once very successful, and the then Nagy government also became a reactionary tool. The Hungarian people cannot tolerate this situation. Therefore, a part of the Nagy government, headed by Kadar, withdrew from the government, formed the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, and requested the Soviet army to provide assistance in order to defend the socialist achievements of the Hungarian people. The Soviet government sent troops at the request of the Hungarian government to defend the current socialist system in Hungary and acted in accordance with the unshirkable obligations stipulated in the Warsaw Treaty. Therefore, there is no Soviet intervention in Hungary at all.

Now it is precisely the United Nations General Assembly that is violating the Charter by discussing Hungary's internal affairs and attempting to interfere in Hungary. Imperialist countries have already exposed their ferocious faces on the Egyptian issue, so they are using all their strength to step up subversive activities against socialist countries. This is the case in Hungary, and it should also arouse vigilance in other socialist countries.

Socialist countries must not allow any subversive activities instigated by external forces and aimed at overthrowing the socialist system. Socialist countries will strengthen their unity and repel such activities.

The people of China and Japan both have the desire to be friendly with each other

VI. What are your views on the current and future relations between China and Japan?

Although the state of war between China and Japan has not been eliminated and normal relations have not been restored, the relations between the two countries have become more developed day by day in recent years. Since World War II, the situation in China and Japan has undergone tremendous changes, and the people of both countries have the desire to be friendly with each other. This can be proved by the increasingly frequent mutual visits between the people of the two countries, the many agreements reached by the people's organizations of the two countries, and the good implementation of these agreements. These developments are conducive to promoting the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan, and cannot be blocked by any external force.

Welcome American journalists to visit China

VII. Do you welcome American journalists to China?

We welcome American journalists to China, and have approved and will continue to approve some American journalists' requests to come to China for interviews. We also welcome people from all walks of life in the United States to visit China to increase mutual contact and understanding between the people of the two countries and eliminate unnecessary estrangement.

The solidarity between China and the Soviet Union is unbreakable, and imperialist countries are squabbling with each other

VIII. Can you compare the relationship between the Soviet Union and China with the relationship between the United States and its major allies?

China and the Soviet Union are both socialist countries. There is no conflict of interest between us. Instead, we treat each other as equals and get along in friendship on the basis of the Five Principles.

The relationship between China and the Soviet Union is a relationship between fraternal countries. Our two countries help and support each other in order to achieve common development, and never harm each other's sovereignty and independence. Between our two countries, as between all socialist countries, benevolent mutual criticism is permitted in principle, and such criticism can only promote our common progress.

The great unity between China and the Soviet Union cannot be undermined by any provocation.

The relationship between the United States and its major allies is a relationship between imperialist countries. There are fundamental conflicts of interest between them, that is, the mutual exclusion, annexation, and replacement of these countries' monopoly capital.

No matter how these countries emphasize their unity, they cannot maintain unity when the interests of the major monopoly capital groups in these countries conflict. This conflict is determined by the profit-seeking and expansionist objective nature of monopoly capital, and it can never be avoided by the subjective desire to maintain unity.

We respect peaceful and neutral countries

IX. Do you believe that small countries like Burma can and should maintain neutrality in a world divided into two major blocs?

The two major blocs you mentioned probably refer to the imperialist countries and the socialist countries. However, there are many nationally independent countries outside of these two blocs. Since World War II, many nationally independent countries have emerged in Asia and Africa, and there are still many countries in Asia, Africa, and other regions that are in the process of or will achieve their own independence. The vast majority of these countries advocate peace and oppose war; they do not participate in opposing military blocs, and they adhere to a neutral and independent policy. At the same time, some countries in Europe also advocate peaceful neutrality.

The imperialist countries and the socialist countries adopt different attitudes towards these countries that advocate peaceful neutrality. The imperialist countries attempt to undermine the peaceful and neutral policies of these countries and try their best to win over a part of them to participate in the opposing military blocs they organize. In Europe, this is the North Atlantic Treaty, and in Asia, this is the Manila Treaty and the Baghdad Treaty. The purpose of involving these countries in military blocs is to facilitate the expansion of imperialist countries, to facilitate their establishment of military bases, and to facilitate their creation of international tensions.

Socialist countries take the opposite attitude. We respect the peaceful and neutral policies of these countries. We believe that peace is what everyone wants, and the more this demand expands, the more likely it is to prevent world war.

Under the threat of imperialist war, the socialist countries of Europe were forced to form the military alliance of the Warsaw Treaty. However, the Warsaw Treaty is a self-defense organization that was forced to be formed. If there were no North Atlantic Treaty, there would be no Warsaw Treaty. Moreover, socialist countries have also taken the initiative to propose the establishment of a European collective security system to replace the North Atlantic Treaty and the Warsaw Treaty. In Asia, even after the Manila Treaty and the Baghdad Treaty were signed, we still advocated the establishment of collective peace and the signing of a collective peace treaty for the Asia-Pacific region, including the United States.

There is also a saying now that if more and more countries advocate peaceful neutrality, a vacuum will be created in certain regions of the world, such as the Middle East and Near East. This is a discourse that despises the sovereignty and dignity of these countries and denies their ability to implement independent policies. Many countries outside the imperialist countries and the socialist countries, such as India, Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Laos, Nepal in South Asia, and Egypt, Syria, and other Arab countries in the Middle East and Near East, adhere to a policy of peaceful neutrality. They are by no means a minority. The idea that the peaceful and neutral policies of these countries will create a vacuum can only be regarded as a manifestation of colonialism. We firmly oppose the argument that disregards the sovereignty and dignity of these countries, and we firmly believe that their peaceful and neutral policies should be respected.

The US government stands on the side of colonial countries

X. Do you think the United States is on the side of colonial countries, against the peoples of all countries striving for independence?

We know that the American people, like the people of other countries in the world, are willing to be friendly with the people of all countries and sympathize with the struggles of oppressed people for independence. However, the policy of the US government is not so.

The Chinese people demand the liberation of Taiwan. The Indonesian people demand the recovery of West Irian. The Indian people demand the recovery of Goa. However, the US government has taken the opposite attitude on these issues.

Many countries in Latin America demand progress. However, the US government has carried out subversive activities against Latin American countries, resulting in coups in Guatemala and other countries. The US government is also carrying out subversive activities in other regions of the world.

Even on the Egyptian issue, the US government is trying to replace Britain and France on the one hand, and supporting the so-called international control of the Suez Canal plan of Britain and France on the other hand.

In addition, the US government has also established military bases in many countries around the world, and has obtained privileges in many countries through so-called "aid."

All this cannot make people believe that the US government is on the side of the people of all countries striving for independence.

We believe that the American people are willing to be friendly with the people of all countries and demand peace. The people of all countries demand peace, and more and more people agree with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. As long as the forces of the people of all countries demanding peace continue to grow, any attempt to create division and hinder the friendship of the people of all countries will eventually fail. We firmly believe that the people of China and the United States will one day establish friendly relations and realize their desire to be friendly with each other. I would like to take this opportunity to extend my greetings to the American people on behalf of the Chinese people.

### 周恩来总理答美国记者问

专栏：

    周恩来总理答美国记者问
    新华社3日讯　周恩来总理于1956年12月19日在仰光接见美国哥伦比亚广播公司爱德华·穆罗，回答了他所提出的一些问题。周恩来总理这次答记者问已于12月30日在哥伦比亚广播公司电视节目中播送。问答全文如下：
    到缅甸是为了进行友好访问
    一、你这次访问缅甸的目的是什么？
    我这次应缅甸联邦政府和吴巴瑞总理阁下的邀请来到缅甸，是为了进行友好访问，同缅甸联邦的领导人员讨论对两国利益有关的问题和某些具有国际重要性的问题，并且同缅甸联邦的领导人员一起，参加在中国云南省芒市举行的中缅两国边民大会。
    和平解放台湾的呼声高涨
    二、你认为福摩萨问题有达成协议解决的任何真实前途吗？
    首先，我请你注意，在中国，所有的人，包括蒋介石集团在内，都用“台湾”的名称，而不用“福摩萨”的字样。
    台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。在第二次世界大战以后，台湾已经归还了中国。这不仅是国际协议所规定了的，而且还举行了把台湾归还中国的手续。这一切，都是杜鲁门政府在官方的文件中所已经承认了的。
    现在的问题是，如何争取和平解放台湾，如何争取蒋介石集团使台湾回到祖国的怀抱。
    和平解放台湾和台湾归还祖国的呼声，现在正在一天天地高涨，在蒋介石集团的内部也得到了越来越多的响应。因此，和平解放台湾的可能性正在不断地增长。
    恢复中国在联合国的代表权
    三、你认为在接纳你的政府加入联合国的问题上，什么是主要的反对意见？你是否感到许多政府赞成中国加入联合国，但是由于美国的影响而没有公开地表示这一态度？
    现在的问题不是中国加入联合国的问题，而是恢复中国在联合国的代表权问题。当前，在联合国中占据着中国的席位的人，不代表六万万中国人民所建立的政府，而代表由于挑起内战早为中国人民所推翻的集团。这种情况显然是违反联合国宪章的。
    现在，联合国中赞成恢复中国的合法代表权的国家，虽然在形式上还不是多数，但是却已经代表着世界上半数以上的人口。中国在联合国大会和安全理事会的合法代表权所以至今还没有恢复，其基本原因就在于美国对联合国的影响。但是，在这样情况下受到损害的首先是联合国自己。联合国的组织应该有普遍的代表性，没有六万万中国人民的代表，联合国在解决国际问题中，特别是在解决亚洲的国际问题中，是不能够发挥它的应有的作用的。
    坚决反对制造“两个中国”的阴谋
    四、你愿意评论所谓“两个中国”的政策吗？
    世界上只有一个中国，世界上也只有一个中国政府可以代表中国，那就是中华人民共和国政府。这是六万万中国人民的意志。任何企图制造两个中国的阴谋，都是所有中国人民坚决反对的。
    “两个中国”的政策实际上就是帝国主义国家分裂中国和对中国进行颠覆活动的政策的继续。现在这些国家看到，颠覆中国人民所建立起来的政权已经不可能，因此试图制造两个中国。这是任何中国人，包括蒋介石集团在内，只要具有爱国心，都坚决反对的。
    在匈牙利根本不存在苏联干涉的问题
    五、你愿意评论最近在匈牙利发生的事件吗？
    匈牙利的事件说明，西方国家的某些集团利用匈牙利人民的运动和不满，对匈牙利进行了颠覆活动。这种活动一度很得势，当时的纳吉政府也变成了反动的工具。匈牙利人民是不能容忍这种情况的。因此，纳吉政府中以卡达尔为首的一部分人退出政府，组成工农革命政府，并且请求苏联军队给予协助，以便保卫匈牙利人民的社会主义成果。苏联政府在匈牙利政府的请求下派出军队，保卫匈牙利现行的社会主义制度，并且根据华沙条约所规定的不可推卸的义务办事，因此这里根本不存在苏联干涉匈牙利的问题。
    现在恰恰是联合国大会违反宪章讨论匈牙利的内政问题，企图对匈牙利进行干涉。帝国主义国家在埃及问题上已经暴露了它们的凶恶面貌，因此，它们正在用一切力量加紧对社会主义国家进行颠覆活动。这在匈牙利是如此，在其他社会主义国家，也应该引起警惕。
    社会主义国家决不能允许任何由外力煽动、目的在于推翻社会主义制度的颠覆活动。社会主义国家一定会加强团结，击退这种活动。
    中日两国人民都具有互相友好的愿望
    六、你对中日两国目前和未来的关系的看法如何？
    中日两国之间，虽然战争状态还没有消除，正常关系还没有恢复，但是近几年来，两国之间的关系已经一天比一天地更加发展了起来。第二次世界大战以后，中日两国的情况都有了极大的变化，两国人民都具有互相友好的愿望。这从两国人民之间日益频繁的相互访问，两国人民团体所达成的许多协议和这些协议的良好实施，都可以得到证明。这些发展是有利于促进中日两国正常关系的恢复的，而且也不是任何外力所能阻挡的。
    欢迎美国记者访问中国
    七、你欢迎美国记者到中国去吗？
    我们欢迎美国记者到中国去，并且已经批准了，而且还将继续批准一些美国记者来中国采访的请求。我们也欢迎美国的各界人士来中国访问，增加两国人民的互相接触和了解，消除不应有的隔阂。
    中苏团结牢不可破，帝国主义国家互相倾轧
    八、你能否将苏联同中国之间的关系和美国同它的主要盟国之间的关系作一比较？
    中国和苏联都是社会主义国家，我们之间没有利害冲突，而是在五项原则的基础上平等对待，友好相处。
    中国和苏联之间的关系是兄弟国家之间的关系。我们两国互相帮助，互相支持，以求得共同的发展，而决不损害彼此的主权和独立。在我们两国之间，正如在一切社会主义国家之间一样，善意的相互批评在原则上是许可的，这种批评只能促进我们的共同进步。
    中国和苏联的伟大团结是任何挑拨所不能破坏的。
    美国同它的主要盟国之间的关系是帝国主义国家之间的关系，它们之间存在着根本的利害冲突，那就是这些国家的独占资本之间的互相排挤，互相吞并，互相取代。
    不论这些国家如何强调它们之间的一致，但是一到这些国家的主要独占资本集团的利益发生冲突的时候，它们就无法保持一致。这种冲突是独占资本的唯利是图和力求扩张的客观性质所决定的，它决不是想保持一致的主观愿望所能避免的。
    我们尊重和平中立国家
    九、你是否相信，在世界分裂为两大集团的情况下，像缅甸这样的小国能够而且应该维持中立？
    你所说的两大集团，大概是指帝国主义国家和社会主义国家集团。但是，在这样的两个集团以外，还有很多民族独立的国家。第二次世界大战以后，在亚非地区兴起了许多民族独立的国家，而且在亚非和其他地区还有不少的国家正在或者将要取得他们自己的独立。这些国家之中的绝大多数都主张和平，反对战争；他们不参加对立的军事集团，他们坚守中立的独立政策。同时，在欧洲也有一些国家主张和平中立。
    帝国主义国家集团和社会主义国家集团对于这些主张和平中立的国家，采取着不同的态度。帝国主义国家企图破坏这些国家的和平中立政策，竭力拉拢其中一部分来参加他们所组织的对立的军事集团，这在欧洲就是北大西洋公约，在亚洲就是马尼拉条约和巴格达条约。把这些国家卷入军事集团的目的，就是要便于帝国主义国家的扩张，便于他们建立军事基地，便于他们制造国际紧张局势。
    社会主义国家采取着相反的态度。我们尊重这些国家的和平中立政策。我们认为和平是大家所要求的，这样的要求越是扩大，世界战争的阻止就越有可能。
    在帝国主义战争的威胁下，欧洲的社会主义国家被迫组成了华沙条约的军事联盟。但是，华沙条约是被迫组成的自卫机构，如果没有北大西洋公约，就不会有华沙条约。而且，社会主义国家还主动地提出了建立欧洲集体安全制度来代替北大西洋公约和华沙条约的建议。在亚洲，即使在马尼拉条约和巴格达条约订立以后，我们仍旧主张建立集体的和平，主张签订包括美国在内的亚洲和太平洋地区的集体和平公约。
    现在还有一种说法，认为如果主张和平中立的国家越来越多，世界上某些地区，例如中近东，就会产生一种真空的现象。这是藐视这些国家的主权和尊严，否认他们能够执行独立政策的论调。在帝国主义国家集团和社会主义国家集团以外的许多国家，例如南亚的印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰、阿富汗、柬埔寨、老挝、尼泊尔等和中近东的埃及、叙利亚等阿拉伯国家，都坚守和平中立的政策。他们决不是少数。认为这些国家的和平中立政策将造成真空的现象，只能被看作是一种殖民主义思想的表现。我们坚决反对无视这些国家的主权和尊严的论调，我们坚决认为他们的和平中立政策应该受到尊重。
    美国政府是站在殖民国家一边的
    十、你认为美国是站在殖民国家的一边，反对争取独立的各国人民的吗？
    我们知道，美国人民同世界其他国家的人民一样，愿意同各国人民友好，并且同情被压迫人民争取独立的斗争。但是，美国政府的政策不是如此。
    中国人民要求解放台湾。印度尼西亚人民要求收复西伊里安。印度人民要求收回果阿。但是，美国政府在这些问题上都采取相反的态度。
    拉丁美洲的许多国家要求进步。但是，美国政府却对拉丁美洲国家进行颠覆活动，造成了危地马拉等国的政变。美国政府也同样地在世界的其他地区进行颠覆活动。
    即使在埃及问题上，美国政府也是一方面企图取英法而代之，另一方面又支持英法的所谓国际管制苏伊士运河的计划。
    此外，美国政府还在世界上的许多国家建立军事基地，并且通过所谓“援助”，在许多国家取得特权。
    这一切都不能使人相信，美国政府是站在争取独立的各国人民的一边的。
    我们相信，美国人民愿意同各国人民友好，并且要求和平。世界各国人民要求和平，而且赞成和平共处五项原则的人也越来越多。只要各国人民要求和平的力量不断壮大，任何制造分裂、阻碍各国人民友好的企图，最后都是要失败的。我们深信，中美两国人民总有一天会建立友好的关系，实现互相友好的愿望。我借此机会代表中国人民向美国人民致意。
