    A Town Shouldn't Be Governed by Two Provinces

    To the Editor:
    In areas where provinces border each other, there is often a situation where a market town is divided and governed separately. This not only leads to overlapping institutions but also increases difficulties in work. Take Anhui Province as an example; there are two such market towns. One is Yexueji, bordering Henan Province, with only a bridge separating them. It's the same town, but the west side of the bridge belongs to Henan Province, while the east side belongs to Anhui Province. The other is Danyang Town, bordering Jiangsu Province, separated only by a small alleyway, with the southern part of the alley belonging to Anhui and the northern part to Jiangsu. Thus, two town people's committees, two banks, two cooperatives... are established. All the institutions that should be established have duplicate sets. This not only wastes manpower and resources but also creates inconsistencies in work. I am a commercial worker, and just from the perspective of commercial work, there are many difficulties. For example, the price policies cannot be implemented uniformly, causing market chaos, and the supply of goods is also unbalanced, and other provinces have similar situations. I suggest that towns and cities divided and governed by two provinces should be placed under the administration of one province based on local specific circumstances.

    一个镇不该两个省管编辑同志：
    在省和省交界的地方，常有一个集镇而又分而治之的情况，这样不但机构重叠，而且增加工作上的困难。就以安徽省来说，这样的集镇就有两个。一个是叶穴集，同河南省交界，中间只有一桥之隔。同是一个镇，桥西属河南省，桥东则属安徽省。另一个是丹阳镇，同江苏省交界，中间只隔一小巷口，巷的南部属安徽，北部属江苏。这样就设立了两个镇人民委员会，两个银行，两个合作社，……。凡是应该设立的机构，都具备了双套，这样不独造成人力物力的浪费，而且在工作上步调不一。我是一个商业工作者，仅就商业工作来讲，也有很多困难。比如价格政策的不能统一执行，引起市场混乱，货源的供应也不平衡等等。其他省份也有类似情况。我建议把由两省分而治之的市镇，根据当地具体情况划归一个省管理。　花雨农
