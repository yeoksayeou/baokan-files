    China-Poland Women's Basketball Match
    Polish Team Wins Again
    (Our dispatch) The Polish women's basketball team played its second friendly match in China last night against our famous "August 1st" team at the Beijing Gymnasium. During the forty-minute game, both sides adopted an aggressive man-to-man defense and fast break attacks whenever possible. The score was tied twelve times during the match. The scores for the first three quarters (ten minutes per quarter) were 20-19, 39-37, and 53-50, with a maximum difference of only three points. However, in the fourth quarter, the "August 1st" team, due to a disorganized lineup and lax defense, lost to the Polish team with a score of 71-63.

    At the beginning of the game, Zhou Zhengyun of the "August 1st" team immediately scored a basket. The visiting team was not to be outdone, and captain Olesewicz immediately responded with two points. After that, the "August 1st" team repeatedly scored with fast breaks and cuts to the basket, while the visiting team used its specialty – accurate mid-range shooting – to closely follow. At fifteen minutes, the Polish team substituted Janina, who is 1.82 meters tall. The "August 1st" team immediately substituted Shi Wenyuan, a tall player of 1.80 meters, to closely guard Janina. Although Janina was closely guarded by Shi Wenyuan and other players, she still moved back and forth in the basket and scored four consecutive goals. Fortunately, Chen Changfeng and Ge Li repeatedly scored, and the visiting team led by two points at the end of the first half.

    At the beginning of the second half, both sides took the opportunity to fast break and closely press their opponents. During this period, the score was tied at 44 and 48. At this time, Qian Youping and Chen Changfeng of the "August 1st" team were very active, and whenever the opponent's defense was slightly negligent, they immediately rushed into the basket to score, resulting in a three-point lead at the end of the third quarter.

    In the last quarter, the Polish team, rich in international competition experience, played very calmly and intelligently. They took advantage of the "August 1st" team's change to a pressing man-to-man tactic and confused defense to find gaps, and Kapaczynska and Dombrowska easily put the ball into the basket under the basket, ending the friendly match with a score of 71-63.

    中波女子篮球赛
    波兰队再次得胜
    本报讯　波兰女子篮球队昨晚在北京体育馆对我国著名的“八一”队进行了来中国后的第二场友谊比赛，在四十分钟的比赛中，双方都采取了积极主动的人盯人和一有机会便快攻偷袭的打法，在比赛过程中两队曾十二次打成了平手，前三节（每十分钟一节）的比数是二十比十九、三十九比三十七和五十三比五十，最多仅差三分，只是在第四节时，“八一”队由于阵容较乱，防守不严，以七十一比六十三输于波兰队。
    比赛一开始，“八一”队周正云立即投进一球，客队不甘示弱，队长奥列塞维茨马上还敬二分。此后“八一”队快攻、篮下切入屡屡建功，客队也利用专长——准确的中距离投篮紧随不舍，至十五分钟时，波兰队换上身高一公尺八十二公分的雅妮娜，“八一”队也马上换上身高一公尺八十公分的大个儿石文苑紧紧盯住雅妮娜，虽然在石文苑和其他队员严密看守下，雅妮娜还是在篮下来回摆动，接连投进了四个球，“八一”队幸赖陈常凤和葛利屡屡投中，至上半时结束，客队领先二分。
    下半时一开始，双方都乘机快攻，并且紧紧逼住对手，其间曾打成了四十四平、四十八平，这时“八一”队钱幽屏、陈常凤十分活跃，每趁对方防守稍一疏忽，便立即窜入篮下得分，结果以领先三分结束了第三节。
    在最后一节中，富于国际比赛经验的波兰队打得非常冷静机智，她们趁“八一”队改用紧逼人盯人战术、防守较混乱的时候，接连找到空隙，由卡帕钦斯卡、董布洛夫斯卡轻易地在篮下将球托入，最后以七十一比六十三结束了这场友谊比赛。
