Our Correspondent Hu Sisheng reports from Warsaw on the 12th: On the morning of January 11th, the sun broke through the clouds that had been hanging over Warsaw in recent days, shining on the road leading from the city to the suburban airport. A long line of cars was heading towards the airport, the gateway for the Chinese delegation to enter Warsaw.

Arriving at the airport, the surrounding area was already filled with welcoming crowds. The national flags of China and Poland looked particularly pleasing under the sunlight. Some banners were written in both Chinese and Polish: "Long Live the Brotherly Friendship Between the Chinese and Polish People!"

Reporters from various countries who came to cover the event had already arrived at the airport, gathering in groups of twos and threes to talk; photographers were checking their lenses and considering their shooting angles. Just as the reporter was about to take out his notebook to record the scene, a middle-aged man wearing a Chinese leather coat and several cameras around his neck walked towards me.

"Are you Chinese?"
"I'm a reporter from a Chinese newspaper."
"Ah! I'm a reporter from a Swiss newspaper. I visited China last year. I like China very much. Premier Zhou's visit is a major event. Beijing and Warsaw are both important places. Oh! I have to go."

It turned out that at this time, a slender silver swallow was gliding across the blue sky dotted with white clouds. The "Tu-104" jet airliner carrying the Chinese delegation had arrived over Warsaw Airport.

At exactly ten o'clock, the plane slowly taxied to the center of the airport. The cabin door opened, and Premier Zhou and Vice Premier He Long appeared at the door with smiles on their faces. Gomulka, Zawadzki, Cyrankiewicz, and other Polish party and government leaders stepped forward to greet them, and Ambassador Wang Bingnan introduced them to Premier Zhou one by one. At this moment, the guard of honor played the national anthems of China and Poland, and Premier Zhou raised his right hand in solemn salute. Subsequently, the Chinese guests reviewed the guard of honor and walked to the front of the Polish government officials, diplomatic envoys, and staff of the Chinese Embassy who had come to welcome the Chinese government delegation, shaking hands with them one by one. Nine children wearing light blue hats, scarves, and light yellow sweaters presented flowers to the Chinese guests. Premier Zhou and Vice Premier He Long took photos with the children. At this time, Cyrankiewicz stepped up to the loudspeaker and delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the Polish government and people. Then, Premier Zhou Enlai spoke in a slow and sonorous voice. After his speech was translated into Polish, it aroused warm applause from the people present.

This was not Premier Zhou Enlai's first visit to Warsaw. After the Geneva Conference in 1954, the Chinese Premier had already met Warsaw. Now, after two and a half years, Premier Zhou has come again. But this time it has even greater significance. Looking through the Polish newspapers in the days before the Premier's arrival, one can feel how much Polish public opinion values this visit. The itinerary and personnel list of the Chinese delegation's visit to Poland were all published in prominent positions on the front page of the newspapers. On the 10th, "People's Tribune" published five photos of Premier Zhou. On the evening of the 8th, Warsaw Radio introduced Premier Zhou's life.

A responsible staff member of "People's Tribune" told reporters: "Premier Zhou's visit to Poland has extremely important significance. The people, especially the Party members, are very interested in this visit. Because the full understanding and support of the Chinese Party and government for our Party has special significance."

On January 7th, when the reporter reported to the Information Department of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a United Press reporter stationed in Warsaw was anxiously requesting the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide convenience in order to do a good job of reporting on Premier Zhou's visit to Poland, requesting a special seat on the special car when Premier Zhou traveled from Warsaw to various parts of Poland. In order to cover the visit of Premier Zhou and others to Poland and the Polish elections, as many as forty-five Western bourgeois press reporters from the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, West Germany, Italy, and Austria came to Warsaw around the 10th, not including the Western reporters already here.

Two things that happened here before Premier Zhou's visit to Poland also attracted people's attention. A few days ago, a trade delegation led by Li Zheren, Vice Minister of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade, arrived in Warsaw. "People's Tribune" commented: "The trade between the two countries has grown tremendously in recent years. China is not only a sales market for our machinery and equipment, but also a market for our complete sets of industrial equipment. On the other hand, China supplies us with many valuable goods, such as iron ore, tungsten ore, tin, cotton, wool, hemp, and sulfur. But the possibilities of our import and export trade with China have not been fully utilized. Therefore, we are very concerned about developing trade between the two countries."

Another thing is: On January 10th, Premier Cyrankiewicz personally cut the ribbon and delivered a speech at the opening ceremony of the Chinese Dunhuang Mural Exhibition. Under the strong illumination of mercury lamps, the ancient murals with a strong oriental flavor, set off by the exquisite European-style marble pillars of the Warsaw Palace of Science and Culture, gave the exhibition hall a unique flavor. These two events on the eve of the Chinese Premier's visit to Poland undoubtedly strengthened the atmosphere of the Chinese government delegation's visit to Poland.

    波兰人民热情地欢迎来自中国的贵宾
    本报华沙12日电　本报记者胡思升报道：1月11日早晨，阳光冲破了近日笼罩在华沙上空的阴云，照射在从市内通往近郊机场的公路上。长列的汽车队伍在向机场行进，这里是中国代表团进入华沙的门阶。
    赶到机场，四周已经站满了欢迎的人群。中波两国的国旗在阳光下显得分外悦目。有的标语牌上，用中波两种文字写着：“波中两国人民兄弟般的友谊万岁！”
    来采访的各国记者早已来到机场上，三五成群地聚在一起谈论；摄影记者们在检查镜头和考虑取景角度。记者正要拿出笔记本记录现场情景，一个穿着中国皮大衣、胸前挂着好几个照相机的中年人向我走来。
    “你是中国人？”
    “我是中国报纸记者。”
    “啊！我是瑞士报纸记者。去年我访问过中国。我很喜欢中国。周总理来访问是很重大的事件。北京和华沙都是重要的地方。呀！我要走了。”
    原来这时一只狭长的银燕正在飘浮着朵朵白云的蓝色天空滑行，中国代表团乘坐的喷气式客机“图—104”号已经到达华沙机场上空了。
    十时正，客机徐徐滑行到机场中心。舱门打开了，周总理、贺龙副总理面带笑容，出现在舱门口。哥穆尔卡、萨瓦茨基、西伦凯维兹等波兰党和政府领导人迎步上前，王炳南大使一一把他们介绍给周总理。这时仪仗队奏起中波两国国歌，周总理把右手举起来肃立致敬。随后，中国客人们检阅仪仗队，并走到来欢迎中国政府代表团的波兰政府官员、外交使节和中国大使馆工作人员前面，同他们一一握手。九个戴着浅蓝色帽子、围着围巾、身穿着浅黄色绒衣的儿童，把鲜花献给中国客人。周总理、贺龙副总理同孩子们一起照了相。这时，西伦凯维兹走到扩音器前，代表波兰政府和人民向客人致欢迎词。接着，周恩来总理用缓慢而宏亮的声音讲话。他的讲话被译成波文后，引起到场人们的热烈掌声。
    周恩来总理并不是第一次来华沙。1954年日内瓦会议后，中国总理就已经同华沙见过面。现在经过二年半之后，周总理又来了。但是这一次却有着更加重大的意义。翻开总理到达前几天的波兰报纸，就会感觉到波兰舆论是怎样重视这次访问。中国代表团访波的日程和人员名单，都登在报纸第一版的显著地位。10日的“人民论坛报”登了五张周总理的照片。8日晚上，华沙电台又介绍周总理的生平。
    “人民论坛报”的一位负责工作人员对记者说：“周总理访波有极为重要的意义。人民，尤其是党员，对这次访问抱有很大兴趣。因为，中国党和政府对我们党的充分谅解和支持，有着特殊的意义。”
    1月7日记者到波兰外交部情报司报到时，一位合众社驻华沙记者为了做好周总理访波的报道，正在着急地要求波兰外交部给予方便，要求在周总理从华沙赴波兰各地参观时，在专车上特为给他一个席位。为了采访周总理等访波和波兰的大选，10日前后从美国、英国、法国、荷兰、瑞典、丹麦、西德、意大利、奥地利前来华沙的西方资产阶级报刊记者有四十五位之多，这还不包括早已在这里的西方记者。
    在周总理访波前有两件在此地发生的事情，也引起了人们的注意。前几天，由中国对外贸易部副部长李哲人率领的贸易代表团到达华沙。“人民论坛报”这样评论：“近年来的两国贸易已有巨大增长，中国不仅是我们机器设备的销售市场，也是我们成套工业设备的市场。另一方面，中国供给我们许多宝贵的货物，像铁砂、钨砂、锡、棉花、羊毛、大麻及硫磺。但我们同中国进出口贸易的可能性尚未完全利用。因此，我们很关心发展两国贸易。”
    另一件事是：1月10日，在中国敦煌壁画展览会的开幕式上，西伦凯维兹总理亲自剪彩并致词。在强烈的水银灯的照耀下，具有浓厚东方色彩的古代壁画，衬托着华沙科学文化宫精致的欧洲式样的大理石柱，使展览厅里别有一番风味。在中国总理访波前夕的这两件事无疑都加强了中国政府代表团访波的气氛。
