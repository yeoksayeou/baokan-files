Bright Blossoms, Abundant Cotton Bolls
Sea Island Cotton Blooms and Fluffs in Baise County in Deep Winter

This newspaper reports according to the Guangxi Daily: Now is the heart of winter, and the plants and trees in the mountains and fields are already withering, but the Sea Island cotton, which was trialed last year by the Liangpa Zhuang and Yao Nationalities United Agricultural Cooperative in Baise County, Guangxi, is blooming with bright flowers on the hills. Abundant cotton bolls hang all over the branches, some of which are fluffing out snow-white cotton, appearing particularly moving in the deep winter sunshine.

Sea Island cotton is a perennial long-staple cotton. Its fibers are fine, smooth, and long, with strong tensile strength, good quality, and high yield, and can be spun into high-quality yarn. At present, this type of cotton is only cultivated on a relatively large scale in Kaiyuan and Yuanjiang counties in Yunnan Province. Guangxi Province only began to focus on trial planting last year, and Liangpa Agricultural Cooperative in Baise County is one of the key trial planting sites. Last year, this cooperative trialed a total of fifteen mu. Thanks to the help of the Party and the People's Government in bringing in rare seeds from other provinces and teaching them planting techniques, the trial planting was successful.

Two days before New Year's Day this year, the Baise County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Committee specially organized more than 30 representatives from various agricultural cooperatives in the county to visit this Sea Island cotton, which was grown in the Baise mountain area for the first time, in order to learn from the experience, increase confidence, and prepare for the promotion of 1,500 mu of Sea Island cotton planting throughout the county this year.

As soon as the visiting team stepped into the Sea Island cotton field, everyone cheerfully ran towards the blooming cotton bolls, affectionately stroking them. In order to understand how much cotton Sea Island cotton could produce, some representatives counted the number of cotton bolls on the cotton trees one by one: the more productive ones had more than 180 bolls per plant, the average ones had 80 to 100, and the fewer ones had 30 to 50. Each mu of land can plant 250 to 300 plants. So, it can be estimated that each mu can harvest more than 200 jin of seed cotton per year, which is many times higher than the yield of local herbaceous cotton. The representatives all expressed that they would plant Sea Island cotton in large quantities when they returned.

### 鲜艳的花朵　累累的棉桃  深冬季节里海岛棉在百色县开花吐絮

    鲜艳的花朵　累累的棉桃
    深冬季节里海岛棉在百色县开花吐絮
    本报讯　据广西日报报道：现在正是深冬，山野里的草木已萎黄一片，而广西百色县两琶僮、瑶民族联合农业社去年试种的海岛棉，却在山地上开放着鲜艳的花朵，累累的棉桃挂满枝头，有的正吐出雪白的棉絮，在深冬的阳光里显得格外动人。
    海岛棉是一种多年生的长绒棉，它的纤维细滑而长，拉力很强，质地又好，产量也高，能够纺织成上等纱布。这种棉，目前仅在云南省的开远和元江等县有比较大面积的栽培。去年，广西省才开始重点试种，百色县两琶农业社是试种的重点之一。去年这个社共试种了十五亩，由于党和人民政府帮助他们从外省调来了不易多得的种子，又教给他们种植技术，试种成功。
    今年元旦前两天，中共百色县委会和县人民委员会特地组织县内各农业社代表共三十余人，到两琶社参观这第一次生长在百色山区的海岛棉，以便吸取经验，提高信心，为今年全县推广种植一千五百亩海岛棉作好准备。
    参观的队伍一踏进海岛棉林，个个都兴高采烈地奔向正在开放的棉桃旁边，亲热地抚摩着它们。有些代表为了解海岛棉到底能产多少棉花，他们一朵一朵地计算了棉树上结下的棉桃数目：每株结得多的有一百八十多个，一般的有八十至一百个，少的也有三十至五十个，每亩地能种二百五十至三百株，那么推算每亩每年便可以收籽棉二百斤以上，比本地草棉产量高好多倍。代表们都表示回去要大量种植海岛棉。
