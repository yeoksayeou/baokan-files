    A Deep Well in the Jiuquan Basin Gushes Oil
    This Area May Be a New Oilfield with Large Reserves
    (Our newspaper, Lanzhou, 25th) China's deepest flowing oil well – the Ya'erxia No. 1 exploration well – began to gush oil at midnight on January 15th. Dark brown crude oil shot out strongly from the depths of more than 2,600 meters underground, reaching a height of more than twenty meters. Even with the oil testing not yet normal, it produces about 50 tons of oil per day. When the good news came, tens of thousands of workers at the Yumen Oil Mine were overjoyed. Geologists believe that the gratifying results of the Ya'erxia No. 1 well's oil test initially confirm that this area is likely to be an excellent new oilfield with industrial value in the Jiuquan Basin. Its self-flowing capacity is very strong, and the thickness of the oil-bearing sand layer is equivalent to the largest oil-producing layer in the Laojunmiao Oilfield.
    Ya'erxia is located in the vicinity west of the Laojunmiao Oilfield. Due to its proximity to the motherland's first petroleum base, future exploitation and smelting will have extremely favorable conditions. In order to ascertain the situation, drilling is continuing.

    酒泉盆地一口最深井喷油
    这个地区可能是个储量很大的新油田
    本报兰州25日电　我国一口最深的自喷油井——雅儿峡一号探井，在元月15日午夜开始喷油，深褐色的原油从两千六百多公尺的地层深处，强烈地喷射出来，直到二十多公尺的高空。在试油还不正常的情况下，每天出油五十吨左右。喜讯传来，玉门油矿数万名职工欣喜若狂。地质家们认为：雅儿峡一号井试油的可喜结果，初步证实了这个地区很可能是酒泉盆地的一个优良的具有工业价值的新油田，它的自喷能力很强，含油砂层的厚度相当于老君庙油田最大的采油层。
    雅儿峡位于老君庙油田以西的附近地区，由于接近祖国第一个石油基地，将来的开采和冶炼都具有极其有利的条件。为了查明情况，现在正继续进行钻探。
