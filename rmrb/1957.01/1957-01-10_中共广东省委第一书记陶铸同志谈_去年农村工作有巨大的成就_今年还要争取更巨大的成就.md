Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 9th. Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, said that as long as cadres can fully estimate the great achievements of agricultural cooperation and agricultural production last year, and organize this year's agricultural production, they will clearly see the various favorable conditions, muster courage and work actively. Then, Guangdong Province's agricultural cooperatives and agricultural production will definitely be better this year.

Tao Zhu yesterday discussed the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives and how to achieve greater achievements in this year's agricultural production with Comrade Dang Xiangmin, Secretary of the Xin Hui County Party Committee. He invited Xinhua News Agency reporters to participate in the discussion to elaborate on his above views.

    **Fully Estimating Achievements Can Enhance Confidence**

Tao Zhu said: The Provincial Party Committee believes that Guangdong has made great achievements in the cooperation movement and agricultural production last year. On this basis, it will definitely be better this year. However, this estimation has not been understood by all cadres. He said, "Lack of understanding" has led to a lack of confidence and hesitation in work.

He hoped that the Guangdong Party organization should first educate cadres to objectively and comprehensively estimate last year's cooperation and agricultural production, affirming that achievements are the main thing, and that shortcomings and some mistakes are difficult to completely avoid in the course of progress, and can be corrected. He said that if this analysis can be made, it can enhance confidence.

Tao Zhu attached great importance to some of the materials provided by Comrade Dang Xiangmin, Secretary of the Xin Hui County Party Committee, about the achievements made by the county after cooperation. In Xin Hui County, out of more than 1,200 cooperatives, 90% increased production last year, and 95% of the county's cooperative farmers increased their income. Among the cooperatives that increased production, about 50% had significantly improved production levels, and the personal income of members had reached the level of the original well-to-do middle peasants. Except for a slight reduction in citrus production, all crops and sideline businesses in the county increased production across the board. After setting aside enough seeds and feed, each person had an average of about 580 jin of grain (rice, excluding miscellaneous grains), and 110 million jin of rice were transferred out. Since the establishment of the cooperative, no cooperative member has withdrawn (more than 20 households had requested to withdraw last year, but after good distribution, they are no longer withdrawing). Tao Zhu said that Xin Hui County cannot represent the entire province, but among the nearly 70,000 cooperatives in the province, 70% to 75% increased production last year, and about 70% to 80% of the province's more than 7.5 million agricultural households increased their income. The province's grain production increased by 2.14 billion jin, setting a historical record.

    **Shortcomings Can Be Corrected, No Need to Be Alarmed**

Tao Zhu said that there are certainly shortcomings, mainly due to the lack of experience caused by the newly formed cooperatives. For example, the unitary organization of production in the first half of last year, neglecting sideline production, had affected the income of the cooperatives for a period of time; and in the reform of agricultural technology and agricultural capital construction, the requirements were slightly higher and more urgent, causing some losses to a small number of cooperatives. These should be avoided and must be corrected this year. He then pointed out: Guangdong suffered severe drought in the second half of last year, and the province was still able to achieve an annual grain production increase of more than 9%, which was due to the completion of cooperation, which enabled vigorous technological reforms and active agricultural capital construction. However, why did about 1% of the province's cooperative members (about 80,000 households, of which 200 households have returned to the cooperative) lose their ideological stability and withdraw from the cooperative during the autumn of last year? It should be seen that these withdrawing households are mainly well-to-do middle peasants, members who were originally engaged in handicrafts and other industries, and some households with a lack of labor. It can be imagined that in the first year of cooperation, even if there were no shortcomings in the work, it would indeed be somewhat difficult to completely ensure that the above-mentioned members would not reduce their income and that no one would withdraw from the cooperative. He further pointed out: It was precisely because 95% of the farmers were organized to join the cooperative around the Spring Festival last year that 1% of the members withdrew; it was precisely because the province increased irrigation equipment by 10 million mu that there were problems with the quality of the project and abandoned ponds and wells; it was precisely because of the enthusiastic accumulation of more than 4 billion dan of fertilizer during the spring plowing that there were problems with the digging up of fish ponds and some ineffective fertilizers; it was precisely because of the great success of the province's nearly 4 million mu of single-cropping transformed into double-cropping (including intercropping transformed into continuous cropping) last year that more than 400,000 mu of land replanted with rice had poor harvests. In addition, Guangdong achieved greater success in the promotion of improved varieties and close planting last year, although some losses were also suffered in the promotion of improved varieties and close planting in individual counties and districts, but only in individual areas. Practice produces success, but there will also be failures, and advantages will also bring some disadvantages. The question is which is the main one and which is the secondary one. Therefore, while seeing our great achievements, we must face up to the shortcomings and correct them seriously. But don't be alarmed by the existence of shortcomings, which will not only not help us to correct the shortcomings, but will also greatly weaken our courage to move forward.

    **Strive to Make the Production of Each Cooperative Reach the Level of Upper-Middle Peasants in Two Years**

Tao Zhu said that another way to enhance the confidence and courage of cadres is to educate cadres to fully understand the various favorable conditions for agricultural production this year, and point out the goals that we must strive to achieve in the next two years. Regarding the favorable conditions for agricultural production this year, he pointed out: First of all, the province has achieved advanced agricultural cooperation, and the merger and upgrading of cooperatives have been completed, so we can concentrate our efforts on production this year; secondly, after last year's production victory, the agricultural cooperatives have a little foundation, which has enhanced their ability to expand production; thirdly, better agricultural technology reform and agricultural capital construction will play a greater role this year; the most important thing is that leaders at all levels have gained experience in leading cooperative production last year, which is an important guarantee that things can be done well. He said that the Provincial Party Committee estimates that if there are no major disasters in Guangdong this year, there is full confidence in increasing production, and it is not impossible for the production level of most cooperatives to reach the production level of well-to-do middle peasants; at that time, agricultural cooperatives will naturally be more consolidated. In another year, the production level of all cooperatives in the province will basically reach the production level of well-to-do middle peasants; at that time, our cooperatives can declare "completely consolidated." This is the goal we want to strive to achieve in the next two years.

    **Publicize the Superiority of Agricultural Cooperatives and Improve the Enthusiasm of Cadres and the Masses**

Tao Zhu said that to achieve these two-year goals, it depends first of all on the further improvement of the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. Therefore, it is currently very necessary to publicize and introduce the achievements and experiences of cooperatives that have done well in production and establish banners. The province has recently found dozens of the most outstanding cooperatives and plans to introduce them in the "Southern Daily" one after another, and plans to compile a book "A Year of Cooperation." Each special zone, each county, and each district should also do this, using specific and vivid examples to publicize the superiority of cooperation. Furthermore, commendations and model elections should be carried out throughout the province; all localities should organize visits to exhibitions. All localities should immediately mobilize cadres to go to the countryside to help the cooperatives deeply mobilize all members, and use methods such as calculating production, income, and looking at the construction of the cooperative to conduct a large-scale and systematic publicity and education on the superiority of cooperation to all members in order to improve understanding, enhance confidence, and increase production enthusiasm. On the basis of this, the production plan for next year should be done well, contracting for work and production should be done well, the policy of mutual benefit should continue to be implemented, various field management should be done well in the cooperatives throughout the province, and spring plowing should be actively prepared. This year's preparation for farming, in addition to the county cooperatives organizing a part of the force to carry out sideline production in a planned way, special attention should be paid to the two main tasks of fertilizer accumulation and water conservancy.

    中共广东省委第一书记陶铸同志谈
    去年农村工作有巨大的成就
    今年还要争取更巨大的成就
    新华社广州9日电　中共广东省委员会第一书记陶铸说，只要干部能充分估计去年农业合作化和农业生产的巨大成就，组织今年的农业生产，就会很清楚的看到各种有利条件，鼓足勇气积极工作，那么，广东省的农业社和农业生产，今年肯定会搞得更好。
    陶铸昨天和新会县委书记党向民同志谈农业社的巩固和如何使今年的农业生产取得更大的成就时，曾约新华社记者参加了这次谈话，阐述了他的以上看法。
    全面估计成绩，就能增强信心         
    陶铸说：省委认为广东去年的合作化运动和农业生产，是取得了巨大的成就的。在这个基础上，今年肯定会搞得更好。但是这种估计还没有为全体干部所了解。他说，“不了解”已经产生了信心不足和工作上束手束脚的现象。
    他希望广东党组织应该首先教育干部客观地全面地估计去年合作化和农业生产，肯定成绩是主要的，缺点和一些错误是前进中难于完全避免的，也是可以改正的。他说，如果能这样去分析，就能增强信心。
    陶铸很重视新会县委书记党向民同志所谈的这个县合作化后所取得成就的一些材料。新会县一千二百多个社，去年90％的社增产，而全县入社农户增加收入的达到95％。增产社中有50％左右生产水平有显著提高，社员的个人收入已达到原来富裕中农的水平。全县除柑桔略有减产外，所有作物和副业全面增产。每人除留足种子和饲料外，平均留有口粮（稻谷，不包括杂粮）约五百八十斤，还外调出大米一亿一千万斤。自从办社以来，没有一户社员退社（去年曾有二十多户要求退社，但搞好分配后，现在也不退社了）。陶铸说，新会县固然不能代表全省，但是全省近七万个社，去年增产的也达到70％至75％，全省七百五十多万农业户中，约有70％至80％增加了收入，全省粮食增产二十一亿四千万斤，创历史最高纪录。
    缺点可以改正，不必大惊小怪
    陶铸说，缺点当然是有的，主要是由于合作社刚刚组成，缺乏经验所造成的。如在去年上半年组织生产的单一化，忽视了副业生产，曾在一个时期内影响了合作社的收入；在农业技术改革和农业的基本建设上，要求稍高和急了一些，使少数合作社遭受一些损失。这些今年都应该避免和必须改正。他接着指出：广东去年下半年干旱很厉害，全省仍能获得全年粮食增产9％多的成绩，这是因为合作化完成能大力进行技术改革和积极的进行农业的基本建设所致。但是，为什么去年秋季间全省共约有1％的社员（约八万户，现有二百户已回到社内）思想动摇而退了社？应该看到，这些退社户中，主要是富裕中农和原来从事手工业和其他行业的社员以及一部分缺乏劳动力的困难户。可以设想，在合作化的第一年，即使工作一点缺点也没有，要完全保证上述的社员不减少收入和完全没有人退社，也确是有些困难的。他并进一步指出：正因为去年春节前后组织了95％的农户入社，才发生1％的社员退社；正因为全省增加了一千万亩的灌溉设备，才出现工程质量不高和废塘废井；正因为春耕期间热火朝天的积肥四十多亿担，才出现挖坏鱼塘和有些肥效不高的现象；正因为去年全省近四百多万亩单造改双造（包括间作改连作）的巨大成功，才发生了四十多万亩改种水稻的收成不好。此外，如推广良种与小株密植，广东去年一年是取得了更大的成绩的，虽然在个别县、区在推广良种与小株密植上也受到了一些损失，但仅仅是个别地区而已。实践产生成功，也会有失败，优点中也会带来一些缺点，问题在于哪个是主要的，哪个是次要的。所以，看到我们巨大成绩的同时，要正视缺点，并且认真改正。但对缺点的存在不要大惊小怪，这不仅无助于我们对缺点的改正，而且会大大削弱我们前进的勇气。
    争取每个社的生产
    两年内基本达到上中农水平
    陶铸说，增强干部信心和勇气的另一个办法，是教育干部充分认识今年农业生产的各种有利条件，指出在今后两年内我们所要努力争取达到的目标。关于今年农业生产的有利条件，他指出：首先是全省已经实现了高级农业合作化，并社升级已经完成，今年可以集中力量搞好生产；其次，经过去年的生产胜利，农业社都有了一点家底，增强了扩大生产的能力；再次，更好的进行农业的技术改革与农业的基本建设，今年将会发挥更大的作用；最重要的是各级领导去年一年都获得了领导合作社生产的经验，这是可以把事情办好的重要保证。他说，省委估计，广东省今年如无特大灾害，增产是有十足把握的，大部分地区的合作社的生产水平可以达到富裕中农的生产水平，也不是没有可能的；那时农业社自然会更加巩固。再过一年，全省所有的合作社的生产水平将可基本上达到富裕中农的生产水平；那时我们的合作社就可以宣布“彻底巩固起来”了。这是我们要争取在今后两年内实现的目标。
    宣传农业社的优越性，
    提高干部和群众的积极性
    陶铸说，要实现这两年的目标，首先决定于干部和群众的积极性的进一步提高。因此，目前十分需要宣传介绍生产搞得好的社的成绩和经验，树立旗帜。全省最近已找了几十个最突出的社，准备陆续在“南方日报”介绍，并打算编一本“合作化的一年”的书。各专区、各县、各区也要这样作，以具体生动的事例来宣传合作化的优越性。再就是评功表模，全省各地都要搞；各地都要组织参观展览。各地要立即动员干部下乡，帮助各合作社深入地发动全体社员，以算生产、收入、看社的建设等办法，向全体社员大张旗鼓地有系统地进行一次合作化优越性的宣传教育，在提高认识、增强信心和生产积极性的基础上，把明年的生产规划搞好，作好包工包产和继续贯彻互利政策，在全省的合作社中，搞好各种田间管理，积极准备春耕。今年的备耕工作，除各县合作社组织一部分力量有计划的展开副业生产外，应特别抓紧积肥与水利两项主要工作。
