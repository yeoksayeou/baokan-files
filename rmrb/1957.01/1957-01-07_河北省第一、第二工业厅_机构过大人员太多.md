Hebei Province First and Second Industrial Bureaus
    Overly Large Organizations and Too Many Personnel
    (Our dispatch) According to the Hebei Daily: The Hebei Province First Industrial Bureau and Second Industrial Bureau are plagued by bloated organizations and overstaffing.
    After the Hebei Province Industrial Bureau was divided into the First and Second Industrial Bureaus in the first half of 1956, the number of personnel increased significantly again within a few months. The two bureaus have a total of more than seven hundred and eighty people.
    Due to the large organizations, many unreasonable phenomena have emerged. Both the First and Second Bureaus have supply and marketing, personnel, finance, labor organization, and education bureaus and sections. In addition to these comprehensive bureaus and sections, the specialized bureaus and sections also have departments and groups with similar names. As a result, some staff members have very little to do, or even nothing at all. The Personnel and Education Group of the Geology Section in the First Bureau has two people who have had no work to do. In the past three months, they have only done two things: answered a letter from the public and sent a registration form to the geological team.
    Due to the overlapping of organizations, according to the reflection of more than forty comrades from the two bureaus, the comprehensive sections of the specialized bureaus have many superfluous tasks; if they don't do them, nothing happens, but if they do, the work overlaps with that of the comprehensive sections. Despite this, the two bureaus also "borrowed" twenty-one staff members from factories and mines (nine from the First Bureau and twelve from the Second Bureau), who stayed in the bureaus for a long time to "help."
    Due to the bloated organizations and overlapping levels, the work is full of cumbersome procedures, delays, and mutual buck-passing. Each bureau and section of the First Industrial Bureau has its own sections and groups, which actually constitutes a three-level system. As a result, a document or plan often has to go through seven to nine procedures within the bureau.
    Currently, this situation has attracted the attention of the leaders of these two bureaus, and they are preparing to reorganize the staffing.

### 河北省第一、第二工业厅  机构过大人员太多

    河北省第一、第二工业厅
    机构过大人员太多
    本报讯　据河北日报消息：河北省第一工业厅、第二工业厅，机构臃肿，人浮于事。
    1956年上半年河北省工业厅由一个厅分为第一工业厅和第二工业厅以后，几个月内，人员又增加了很多，两个厅共有七百八十多人。
    由于机构庞大，很多不合理的现象也就出现了。一厅和二厅都分别设有供销、人事、财务、劳动组织、教育等局处，在这些综合局处以外，各专业局处内又分别设有这类名称的科组。这样，有些工作人员就事情很少，甚至无事可做。一厅地质处人事教育组有两个人，一直没工作做。近三个月来他们只做了两件事：答复了一封群众来信，向地质队发了一张登记表。
    由于机构重叠，根据两个厅的四十多个同志反映，专业局的综合科有许多工作是多余的；不做没事干，做吧又和综合处的工作重复。虽然如此，这两个厅还从厂矿“借”来工作人员二十一人（一厅九人，二厅十二人），长期留在厅里“帮忙”。
    由于机构臃肿，层次重叠，工作中手续繁多，办事拖拉，互相扯皮的现象不断发生。第一工业厅各局处下都设有科组，实际上成了三级制。这样一来，一件公文、计划，往往在本厅内就得经过七至九道手续。
    目前，这种情况已经引起这两个厅领导方面的注意，他们正在进行整顿编制的准备工作。
