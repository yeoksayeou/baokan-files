People's China Stands With Us in All Aspects
Premier Kádár's Speech at the Budapest Activists' Conference

Dear Comrades, Respected Listeners:

This is the first time after November 4, 1956, that the communists of Budapest and the representatives of the most outstanding non-Party working people are holding an activist meeting here. Although the extremely difficult (but also glorious) period of fighting the counter-revolution has passed, I think this gathering is still a major event for our capital, for the country, for our Party, and for our working people. The communists, workers, and laborers of Budapest are the main force of the Hungarian communist movement and the Hungarian people's democratic system, no matter how the enemy tries to create chaos in this revolutionary team.

The fact that the delegation of the People's Republic of China, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, who is visiting our country, also participated in this meeting gives our activist meeting a particularly great significance. In this way, two events of great significance in our movement and the lives of our people coincide here today.

The cooperative relationship between Hungary and China has developed. People's China, as a strong and true friend, always stands by our side in all aspects.

Dear comrades, friends, please allow me to sincerely welcome our dear guests from afar, Comrade Zhou Enlai and other comrades present, as well as everyone in Hungary who is attending the activist meeting. Although we do not meet and talk with each other every day, we are fighting together every hour, and the victory of our cause is due to our shared joys and sorrows and our joint efforts. If we gather at such a meeting, all of us will draw new and greater strength.

The presence of Chinese comrades at this meeting gives us particularly great strength. Lenin, the enthusiastic leader of the victorious October Revolution, in looking to the future and talking about the socialist revolution, once wrote in an article: "The outcome of the struggle depends in the final analysis on this circumstance: Russia, India, China, etc. constitute the vast majority of the world's population. However, it is precisely this majority of the population that has recently been very rapidly drawn into the struggle for their own liberation, so in this sense, there can be no doubt as to how the issue of the world struggle will ultimately be resolved. In this sense, the final victory of socialism is fully and absolutely guaranteed."

Lenin wrote this in 1923. The people of China, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, broke the shackles of imperialism, embarked on the road to freedom, and became a socialist world power, thereby thwarting imperialism and making the international working class and the people of all countries striving for freedom rejoice. Lenin was not able to see this day, but we have seen it.

On October 1, 1949, as a result of years of victorious struggle, the People's Republic of China was founded. On October 3, the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Hungarian People's Republic decided to exchange envoys and begin to establish multifaceted ties. On this day, a truly profound friendship and mutually beneficial relationship was born between the People's Republic of China, with a population of 600 million, and the Hungarian People's Republic, with a population of 9.5 million. Our two countries signed agreements on cooperation in culture, trade, postal services, and science, as well as many other agreements. This cooperative relationship has developed.

But friendship can only stand the test in times of adversity. From the day the revolutionary forces of the Hungarian working class launched a resolute struggle to repel and eradicate the counter-revolution that had gained power, People's China has always stood by our side in all aspects as a strong and true friend.

From the invaluable ideological and political assistance provided by articles such as the "People's Daily" article "Once Again on the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," to the provision of long-term freely convertible foreign exchange loans and gratuitous material assistance, People's China has given us enormous support and strength.

It is after these events, in the spirit of comradeship and friendship, that today's meeting between Chinese and Hungarian communists and patriots has taken place, this festive meeting for us, for the Hungarian communists.

I myself have been fortunate enough to have met with leading staff members of the Chinese Party and state many times in Beijing, Moscow, and now in Budapest over the past year, to have seen Chinese workers in factories who received us Hungarians with extreme friendliness, and to have seen simple, elderly Chinese farmers who invited guests to drink tea in their small houses. I cannot express in words the concern and interest that every son of the great Chinese people, whether the highest leader or the most ordinary worker, harbors for the cause of the Hungarian People's Republic and the Hungarian people.

Therefore, at the activist meeting of Party members and non-Party working people in Budapest, I would like to talk about a few domestic issues.

Improve and strengthen ideological struggle, use the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism to steadfastly and patiently enlighten those who cannot see clearly and those who are wavering, and expose the enemies of the working class in disguise.

Dear Comrades!

The struggle we are waging to defend and further develop the achievements of the socialist revolution is largely political in nature during a certain period, but the issue of resolving economic and cultural tasks is also showing its importance.

This situation not only does not exclude, but on the contrary, requires law and order agencies to use an iron fist with a high degree of vigilance to crush any provocative actions that may still arise. It is equally necessary to develop revolutionary armed forces, including the newly established National Defence Forces. Those who organize and incite counter-revolutionary armed attacks on the Hungarian People's Republic must be punished according to the severity of their crimes. However, I do not want to talk about these issues now, but about one or two issues in the ideological and political struggle.

First of all, it is necessary to improve and strengthen ideological struggle. We do this for two profound reasons. First, the active support of the working masses, especially the workers, is the main pillar of our system. And it is impossible to mobilize the masses without giving clear, Marxist-Leninist answers to the new problems that constantly arise in Marxist-Leninist thought and social life and class struggle. Secondly, strengthening ideological struggle is particularly important because one of the intentions of the counter-revolution in the past events was to cause ideological confusion among the working people, even in the ranks of the working class. It must be said that they were not entirely unsuccessful. The counter-revolution called the dark days of slaughtering revolutionaries and communists and undermining the people's democratic system, the attempts of imperialists and capitalists to restore power, "democracy" and "revolution." In the name of "national revolution," they opposed the independence of the Hungarian nation and wanted to turn the Hungarian people into a colony of Western imperialism. Imperialism also used distorted slogans such as "de-Stalinization" and "the struggle against Rakosiism" to achieve the same goal.

After exposing the slogans used for this malicious purpose, the provocative imperialist radio station called "Radio Free Europe" spoke less and less about "de-Stalinization" and "liberalization of communism," and more and more about reactionary slogans that would not be misunderstood in the anti-communist struggle. But here, there is still considerable confusion, even in the minds of some honest people.

We should use the ideological weapons of Marxism-Leninism to steadfastly and patiently enlighten those who cannot see clearly and those who are wavering, while also exposing the enemies of the working class in disguise. Our comrades should use the resolution of the December Central Committee meeting of our Party and the principled statement of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government on January 5 to provide the necessary explanations and clarifications on current issues. In addition, we should also use the statement issued by the five-country communist and workers' parties' talks that began in Budapest on January 1 and the statement issued by the leaders of China, Hungary, and the Soviet Union on January 10. Among recent Marxist works from abroad, such as the Chinese "People's Daily" article entitled "Once Again on the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," it is especially worth studying and publicizing. This is a profound article that discusses the Hungarian issue and has great value.

We do not deny that there has been a noticeable degree of improvement in the work of the Hungarian newspapers and radio stations in recent weeks, but it should be said that the central issue of ideological work among the masses at present, and also the central issue of the ideological and political struggle against the counter-revolution, is to fundamentally improve the propaganda work carried out in newspapers and radio stations. Take the central organ of our Party, "People's Freedom," for example. The effort to change the completely dry, official gazette-like newspaper of the past, to make the newspaper more active and readable, and to give the newspaper the nature of a news daily, can be considered correct. However, scattering important statements of our Party and government and important communiqués of the international workers' movement on various pages of the newspaper, making it so that only clever people can immediately find where the continuation is, printing murder news in shockingly large fonts on the front page, while also using semi-nude dancer photos to make principled articles "more active," is not commensurate with the status of the central newspaper of the Party. This kind of effort is not developing towards a Party newspaper, or even a daily newspaper, but towards the worst bourgeois newspapers. But this kind of development is not acceptable. It seems that some journalist comrades have become accustomed to, under the banner of some kind of "objectivism," making "world news" often entirely or at least largely news from Western capitalist countries, as if socialist countries are not in the "world."

In a situation where written struggle has replaced armed struggle against the counter-revolution, we should attach great importance to ideological work, as well as the news and broadcast propaganda work within it. Revolutionary socialist forces must win in this struggle.

Democracy cannot be without class content. In a country with a dictatorship of the proletariat, the demand for an unspecified, universal democracy can only be a reactionary demand. Implementing an effective dictatorship of the proletariat is the only way to truly safeguard the interests of the working people.

Now I will talk briefly about the issue of the dictatorship of the proletariat. There is no doubt that in recent years reformist views have seeped into the minds of some Hungarian communists, especially some communist intellectuals, and some people have forgotten this basic Marxist point: the form of state power can be diverse, but when the irreconcilable conflict of interest between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat becomes the main contradiction, the state must implement either the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie or the dictatorship of the proletariat. Some people have forgotten that democracy cannot be without class content. In capitalist countries, "democracy" means excluding the working masses from political power, which is the implementation of the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. And in a people's republic, democracy cannot be without class content either. On the contrary, in order to exclude the bourgeoisie from political power, there must be a dictatorship of the proletariat.

Therefore, we condemn the claim of democracy without class content, we implement socialist democracy, this socialist democracy is democracy for the broadest masses of working people, and at the same time, for the exploiters, for the past exploiters who have been deprived of their rights and want to restore class rule, it is a dictatorship. We believe that it is necessary to expand and strengthen socialist democracy for the working masses, and we also condemn the use of the term "universal democracy" to replace socialist democracy. There is no contradiction here. In a country with a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, the demand for an unspecified, universal "democracy" is progressive, because it is a demand to expand the rights of the oppressed (the proletariat). In a country with a dictatorship of the proletariat, the demand for an unspecified, universal democracy can only be a reactionary demand, because it is also a demand to expand the rights of the oppressed, but here, the oppressed is the bourgeoisie.

In our situation, replacing the universal demand for democracy and the confusion surrounding this demand with the implementation of an effective dictatorship of the proletariat is the only way to truly safeguard the interests of the working people. And implementing an effective dictatorship of the proletariat means acting effectively in two areas: consolidating and expanding the rights of the working masses on the one hand, and reducing and restricting the rights of class enemies on the other.

The implementation of an effective dictatorship of the proletariat today particularly requires the implementation of Lenin's principle of democratic centralism in Party and state life. We want to let Party members, and in state life, the working masses, participate as much as possible in making decisions, and at the same time, we also require unity of action in the execution of the decisions that have been made. In other words, it is necessary to consolidate Party and state discipline to a great extent. We must not forget: without strong revolutionary discipline, it is impossible to finally eliminate the counter-revolution.

Relying on the strength of the Hungarian national economy, the people's knowledge, determination, and work, as well as the assistance of fraternal socialist countries, the threat of temporary economic difficulties can be overcome.

Finally, when talking about domestic issues, I also need to talk a little about our temporary economic difficulties. It is our responsibility to openly talk about our difficulties in front of the people. We cannot repeat the harmful actions of those in the past, saying that black things are rosy, but we also cannot say that rosy things are black. Now, if someone reads our newspapers, the two words they see most often are inflation and unemployment. Does the threat of inflation and currency devaluation exist? It does. Does it need to be openly stated? It must be. But relying on the strength of our national economy, relying on the knowledge, determination, and work of Hungarian workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and as a result of the economic assistance of fraternal socialist countries, we have all the real possibilities to face the possible threat of inflation and to overcome this threat - which is also related to this issue. If we take the only possible road, which is the road of increasing production, then we will definitely be able to overcome this threat, and there will be no currency devaluation.

Is there a certain range of mobile unemployment in our country at present? There is. Does this need to be openly stated? It does. Is it not possible for us to limit the phenomenon of unemployment in terms of time and scope, and to overcome this phenomenon in a short period of time? We have every possibility. However, it is wrong and useless to exaggerate the difficulties out of nothing with regard to this issue. It is necessary to mobilize the working masses to complete the urgent tasks, and it is necessary to point out the positive phenomena and examples as well.

In our country, everyone knows that if we want to truly eliminate the threat of currency devaluation, we must increase production. Everyone also knows that in order to increase production, we now need more fuel first and foremost, or more precisely, more coal. If there is more coal and more fuel, the temporary phenomenon of unemployment will be eliminated. Are we moving along this road? We have already set out along this road.

Everyone can see from the simple reports in the newspaper that, as a result of some measures by the government, the enthusiastic and conscious work of the government commissioners who directly manage coal affairs, and, first and foremost, the class-conscious, patriotic, and responsible work of the Hungarian coal miners, the daily output of coal has increased from 12,000 to 14,000 tons to 45,000 to 47,000 tons in one month. If we can continue to advance the development process in this regard, then our main economic difficulties will be resolved.

Currently, some people like to look for rare wonders, so isn't the task completed by our miners a great wonder? Or to narrow it down, the miners in the Nógrád coal area have already produced more than 80% of the coal output before October 23 with fewer people. Isn't this a great wonder? In the Nógrád coal area, the miners of Mizserfa have already reached 98% of the output before October 23 in one day. Isn't this a wonder? These are all great "wonders," all great things in the life of our motherland.

The signs of the vitality and creative ability of the Hungarian people, who have shown that they have sobered up, are becoming increasingly clear, and in the end, the victorious results of overcoming the serious, but transitional, economic difficulties caused by the counter-revolutionary offensive will be achieved.

At our activist meeting, comrades from other places also attended. I think the activists in Budapest can completely tell their peasant brothers through them: if the masses themselves maintain order, if they diligently prepare for the work of spring with the same diligence as in autumn, then we can be completely at peace. If the miners, workers, and technical intellectuals also complete their work, if production can be carried out in factories and on farms, then the Hungarian People's Republic, the government of workers and peasants, will also become strong economically, and we will be able to overcome all transitional difficulties.

The imperialists' plan to pull Hungary out of the socialist camp has failed. We will resolutely repel all conspiracies to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs. We firmly believe that the unity of the socialist camp is indestructible.

Dear Comrades, Respected Listeners!

Finally, I will return to international issues. The imperialists' plan to pull Hungary out of the socialist camp has failed. They hate us very much and are trying every means to undermine the cause of the Hungarian People's Republic. Unfortunately, in order to achieve their goals, they are using the United Nations as a tool. As everyone knows, at the suggestion of the United States, the United Nations General Assembly elected a five-member committee to review the so-called "Hungarian question" that they manufactured. The role of this committee is to harm the sovereignty of the Hungarian People's Republic and interfere in Hungary's internal affairs. Our government has protested against this in a note to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. I can announce that our government will continue to resolutely repel all conspiracies to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs in the future, just as we have done before.

We hope that the United Nations can engage in issues that are beneficial to the peace of mankind and the peace and tranquility of the Hungarian people, such as engaging in disarmament, prohibiting and eliminating atomic and hydrogen weapons, or studying the imperialist aggression against Egypt, the imperialist sabotage and subversion activities against the Hungarian People's Republic and other people's democratic countries, which will better enhance the prestige of the United Nations in the eyes of the people, and will also be more beneficial to mankind. We believe that if the United Nations finally gives the People's Republic of China, which will inevitably be given sooner or later, its legitimate status in the United Nations, this will also enhance the prestige of the United Nations and improve its work.

Dear Comrades!

Just as international imperialism played a decisive role in plotting the counter-revolutionary offensive to overthrow the Hungarian People's Republic, the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, which supported our cause, also played the same decisive role in saving the socialist revolution in Hungary, in the spirit of proletarian internationalism. Therefore, at the international talks in which representatives of our Party and government participated, especially at the five-country Party and government talks in Budapest on January 1 and the China-Hungary-Soviet talks in Moscow on January 10, our representatives firmly believed in the indestructible unity of the socialist camp, united by the idea of proletarian internationalism.

We are loyal to the idea of proletarian internationalism, we are loyal to the unity of the socialist camp, because this is the requirement of our Marxist-Leninist world outlook, because this serves our people, our workers' regime, our People's Republic, and our socialist future.

Dear Comrades!

We feel that each of us is leaving this meeting with unwavering confidence in the cause of the socialist revolution, strengthening the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and with the invincible confidence in the banner of Marxism-Leninism to go to work.

We ask Comrade Zhou Enlai and all members of the Chinese government delegation to bring this message to your great motherland and the fraternal Chinese people.

### 人民中国在各方面都和我们站在一起  卡达尔总理在布达佩斯积极分子大会上的讲话

专栏：

    人民中国在各方面都和我们站在一起
    卡达尔总理在布达佩斯积极分子大会上的讲话亲爱的同志们，尊敬的听众：
    1956年11月4日以后，布达佩斯的共产党人和最优秀的党外劳动人民的代表第一次在这里召开积极分子会议。虽然对反革命进行斗争的极为艰难的（但同时又是光荣的）时期已经过去了，但是，我想这次集会对于我们的首都，对于国家，对于我们党，对于我国劳动人民都仍然是一个重大的事件。布达佩斯的共产党人、工人和劳动者是匈牙利共产主义运动和匈牙利人民民主制度的主要支队，而不管敌人是怎样用一切办法在这支革命队伍中制造混乱。
    除了应邀参加会议的各地积极分子以外，以周恩来总理为首的访问我国的中华人民共和国代表团也参加了这个会议的事实更赋予我们的积极分子会议以特别巨大的意义。这样，今天在这里我们的运动和我们人民生活中两件有着巨大意义的事件就凑在一起了。
    匈中两国的合作关系得到了发展。人民中国作为强大的真正的朋友，总是在各方面站在我们一边。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们，请允许我衷心地欢迎远道而来的亲爱的来宾周恩来同志和其他在座的同志以及匈牙利每一个参加积极分子会议的人。虽然我们彼此不是每日都见面、都交谈，但是我们每小时都在共同地进行斗争，我们事业的胜利就是由于我们同甘共苦，共同努力而得到的。如果我们在这样一个集会上相聚，我们所有的人就都会汲取到新的更大的力量。
    中国同志们出席这次会议给了我们特别巨大的力量。胜利的十月革命的热情的领导者列宁在展望未来，在谈到社会主义革命时曾在一篇文章中这样写道：“斗争底结局归根到底是取决于这个情况：俄国、印度、中国等等占世界人口底极大多数。然而正是这大多数人口最近几年来也非常迅速地卷入争取自身解放的斗争，所以在这个意义上，对于世界斗争问题最终将如何解决，不能有丝毫怀疑。在这个意义上，社会主义底最后胜利是完全和绝对有保证的。”
    列宁是在1923年这样写的。在中国共产党领导下的人民打断了帝国主义的桎梏，走上了自由的道路，变成了一个社会主义的世界大国，从而使帝国主义遭到了挫败，使国际工人阶级以及争自由的各国人民欢欣鼓舞。列宁没有能看到这一天，但我们却见到了这一天。
    1949年10月1日，由于胜利斗争多年的结果，成立了中华人民共和国。10月3日，中华人民共和国和匈牙利人民共和国的政府就决定互派使节并开始建立多方面的联系。在这一天，有六亿人口的中华人民共和国和有九百五十万人口的匈牙利人民共和国之间真正深厚的友好和互利的关系就诞生了。我们两国之间签订了在文化、贸易、邮政和科学方面进行合作的协定以及很多其他的协定。这种合作关系得到了发展。
    但友谊只有在患难中才经得住考验。从匈牙利工人阶级的革命力量投入坚决的斗争以击退并铲除得势的反革命的那天起，人民中国总是作为强大的真正的朋友，在各方面站在我们这一边。
    从像“人民日报”的“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”一文所提供的那种不可估量的思想和政治帮助起，一直到给予长期的自由外汇贷款和无偿的物资援助为止，人民中国都给予了我们以巨大的支持和力量。
    是在这些事件之后，是按照同志情谊和友好的精神，才有了中国同匈牙利共产党人和爱国者之间今天的会见，才有了这个对于我们、对于匈牙利共产党人节日样的会见。
    我个人一年来很幸运地曾在北京、莫斯科以及现在在布达佩斯多次见到中国党和国家的领导工作人员，见到工厂里极为友好地接待我们匈牙利人的中国工人，见到在小屋里请客喝茶的朴素的年迈的中国农民。我不能用语言来表达伟大的中国人民的每一个儿子，不论是最高领导人或是最普通的劳动者，对匈牙利人民共和国和匈牙利人民的事业所怀抱的关心和兴趣。
    因此，在布达佩斯党员和非党劳动人民的积极分子会议上，我想谈几个国内问题。
    改进和加强思想斗争，用马克思列宁主义的思想武器坚定地耐心地启发看不清楚的人、动摇的人，并揭露伪装起来的工人阶级的敌人。
    亲爱的同志们！
    我们为保卫进一步发展社会主义革命成就而进行的斗争在一个时期之中大部分是政治性的，但解决经济和文化任务的问题也显示了重要性。
    这种情况不但不排除，相反的，却需要维持治安的机构以高度的警惕用铁的手腕来粉碎一直还可能产生的挑衅行动。发展革命的武装力量，包括新建的国防军，也是同样需要的。必须按照罪行轻重惩罚对匈牙利人民共和国进行反革命武装攻击的组织者和煽动者。但是，现在我不想谈这些问题，而要谈一谈思想和政治斗争中的一两个问题。
    首先必须改进和加强思想斗争。我们这样作有两个深刻的原因。第一、劳动群众，首先是工人群众的积极的支持乃是我们制度的主要支柱。而不对马克思列宁主义思想和社会生活和阶级斗争中不断出现的新问题给予清楚的、马克思列宁主义的回答，要发动群众是不可能的。其次，加强思想斗争之所以特别重要是因为在过去的事件中，反革命的意图之一就是要在劳动人民，甚至在工人阶级的队伍中引起思想混乱。必须说，他们并不是毫不成功的。反革命把屠杀革命者和共产党人、破坏人民民主制度的黑暗日子，把帝国主义者和资本家复辟的企图叫做“民主”，叫做“革命”。他们在“民族革命”的名义下反对匈牙利民族的独立，想把匈牙利人民变成西方帝国主义的殖民地。帝国主义还利用“非斯大林化”和“反拉科西主义的斗争”这种歪曲的口号来达到同样的目的。
    在揭露了为了这恶毒的目的而使用的口号后，叫做“自由欧洲”的挑衅性的帝国主义电台对“非斯大林主义化”和“共产主义的自由化”就越来越说得少了，谈论在反共产主义斗争中不会被误解的反动口号却更多。而我们这儿却还有相当多的混乱，在一部分正直的人们的头脑中也是如此。
    应该用马克思列宁主义的思想武器坚定地耐心地启发看不清楚的人、动摇的人，同时还要揭露伪装起来的工人阶级的敌人。我们的同志要用我们党的12月中央委员会会议的决议和工农革命政府1月5日的原则声明，对当前的问题进行必要的解释和说明。另外还要用1月1日在布达佩斯开始举行的五国共产党、工人党的会谈和1月10日中匈苏三国领导人会谈所发表的声明。最近国外的马克思主义著作当中，如中国“人民日报”题为“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”的文章，值得特别地进行研究和宣传。这是一篇深刻地论述匈牙利问题的有着巨大价值的文章。
    我们不否认最近几周来匈牙利报刊和电台的工作有着可以察觉出来的某种程度上的改进，但是应该说，目前在群众当中进行思想工作的中心问题，同时也是反对反革命的思想和政治斗争的中心问题是要根本改进在报刊和电台方面进行宣传工作。就说我们党的中央机关报“人民自由报”吧，那种想改变过去完全枯燥的像官方公报似的报纸的努力，把报纸变得更活跃，更令人爱读，使报刊具有新闻日刊性质的努力可以认为是正确的。但是，把我们党和政府的重要声明以及国际工人运动的重要公报在报纸的各个版面上七零八落地刊载一遍，弄得只有机灵的人才能马上找到续载在什么地方，第一版用大得惊人的字体刊载谋杀新闻，同时还用半裸体的舞女相片把有原则意义的文章弄得“活跃一些”，这样一些作法就和党的中央报刊的身分不相称了。这种努力不是向党报，甚至不是向日刊的方向发展，而是向最坏的资产阶级报刊的方向发展。但是，这样发展是不行的。某些记者同志看来已经习惯于在某种“客观主义”的招牌下，把“世界消息”弄得往往全部或者至少大部都是西方资本主义国家的消息，好像社会主义国家不是在“世界”上似的。
    在文字斗争代替了反对反革命武装斗争的情况下，我们应该非常重视思想工作，以及其中的新闻和广播宣传工作，革命的社会主义力量在这个斗争中必须取得胜利。
    民主不能是没有阶级内容的。在无产阶级专政的国家里，没有什么确切说明的普遍的民主的要求只可能是反动的要求。实行有效的无产阶级专政，是真正保卫劳动人民利益的唯一办法。
    现在简单地谈谈无产阶级专政问题。毫无疑问的，最近几年来改良主义观点渗入了一部分匈牙利共产党人的思想中，尤其是一些共产主义的知识分子当中，有些人已经忘记了马克思主义的这个基本论点：国家政权的形式可以是多种多样的，但是当资产阶级与无产阶级之间的不可调和的利益冲突成为主要矛盾的时候，国家必须实行资产阶级或者无产阶级的专政。有些人已经忘了民主是不能没有阶级内容的。在资本主义国家里，“民主”就是把劳动群众从政权中排挤出去，就是实行资产阶级专政。而在人民共和国里，民主也不能是没有阶级内容的，相反，为了把资产阶级从政权中排除出去，必须要有无产阶级专政。
    因此，我们谴责不表明阶级内容的民主的说法，我们实行社会主义的民主，这个社会主义的民主对最广大的劳动群众来说是民主，同时，对剥削者来说，对已经被剥夺了权利的过去的剥削者要恢复的阶级统治来说，是专政。我们认为，对劳动群众来说，有必要扩大和加强社会主义的民主，同时也谴责用普遍“民主”的说法来代替社会主义的民主。这里是没有任何矛盾之处的。在资产阶级专政的国家里，没有什么确切说明的普遍的“民主”要求是进步的，因为这是要求扩大给被压迫者（无产阶级）以权利。在无产阶级专政的国家里，没有什么确切说明的普遍的民主要求只可能是反动的要求，因为这同样是要求扩大给被压迫者以权利，而这里，被压迫者却是资产阶级。
    在我们的情况之下，以实行有效的无产阶级专政代替民主的普遍要求和环绕这要求所产生的混乱，是真正保卫劳动人民利益的唯一办法。而且是在两个方面实行有效的无产阶级专政，即一方面巩固和扩大劳动群众的权利，另一方面缩小和限制阶级敌人的权利。
    实行有效的无产阶级专政，在今天就特别要求在党和国家生活里实行列宁的民主集中制的原则，我们要让党员，在国家生活里要让劳动群众尽可能地参与对事情作出决定，同时，也要求在执行已经作出了的决定中的行动的统一，换句话说，必须要使党和国家的纪律有很大程度的巩固。我们不能忘记：没有坚强的革命纪律，要最终地消灭反革命是不能想像的。
    依靠匈牙利国民经济的力量，人民的知识、决心和工作，以及兄弟社会主义国家的援助，可以克服经济上暂时性的困难的威胁。
    在谈到国内问题的时候，最后，我还需要稍为谈一谈我们经济上暂时性的困难。在人民面前公开地谈我们的困难是我们的责任。我们不能重犯过去那些人的有害的行动，把黑色的东西说成是玫瑰色的，但是我们也不能把玫瑰色的东西说成是黑色的，现在，假如有谁读我们的报刊，他最常看到的是通货膨胀和失业这两个字。通货膨胀和币制贬值的威胁是否存在？是存在的。是否需要公开说明？一定要。但依靠我们国民经济的力量，依靠匈牙利工人、农民和知识分子的知识，决心和工作，由于兄弟社会主义国家的经济援助结果，我们掌握了一切的现实的可能性来正视通货膨胀可能发生的威胁，并且克服这种威胁——这也是同这个问题有关的。假如我们走唯一可能的道路，即增加生产的道路，那么我们一定能克服这种威胁，并且不会发生任何币制贬值的现象。
    在我国目前有没有一定范围内的流动的失业现象？有的，是否需要公开地说到这一点？需要的。是否我们没有可能使失业现象在时间上及范围上都受到限制，并且在短时期内克服这种现象呢？我们有一切的可能。但是，对于这个问题无中生有地夸大困难是不对的，而且是无益的。需要动员劳动群众来完成急待解决的任务，需要把积极的现象和榜样也指明出来。
    在我国，每个人都知道，如果要真正地消除货币贬值的威胁，必须增加生产。每个人也知道，为了增加生产，现在首先需要更多的燃料，更准确地说来是要更多的煤。假如有更多的煤和更多的燃料，就会消除暂时的失业现象。我们是否在沿着这条道路走？我们是已经沿着这条道路出发了。
    每个人都可以从报纸的简单的报道中看到，由于政府的一些措施，由于直接管理煤的事情的政府专员热情的和自觉地工作，并且首先是由于匈牙利煤矿工人有阶级觉悟的、爱国的和有责任感的工作，结果使煤的日产量在一个月中由一二，○○○——一四，○○○吨提高为四五，○○○——四七，○○○吨。假如我们能继续推进在这方面的发展进程，那么我们的主要经济困难就会得到解决。
    目前有一部分人喜欢寻找稀有的奇事，那末，我们的矿工所完成的任务不是一件极大的奇事么？或是再缩小一些，诺格拉德煤区的矿工们以较少的人数，已经生产了10月23日以前的煤产量的80％多。这不是一件极大的奇事么？在诺格拉德煤区，密兹尔弗奥的矿工们有一天中已经达到10月23日前产量的98％。难道这不是奇事么？这些都是极大的“奇事”，都是我们祖国生活中的极大的事情。
    那些表明清醒了的匈牙利人民的生活力量、创造能力的迹象日益清楚地表露出来了，而到后来，将取得克服由于反革命进攻而造成的严重的，但是是过渡性的经济困难的胜利果实。
    在我们的积极分子会议上，外地的同志们也出席了，我想，布达佩斯的积极分子完全可通过他们转告农民兄弟：假如群众自己来维护秩序的话，假如勤勤恳恳地用在像秋季一样的勤劳来准备春季的工作的话，那么我们完全可以很安定。假使矿工们、工人们和技术知识分子也完成他们的工作，假使在工厂里和农田里生产能够进行，那么，匈牙利人民共和国、工人和农民的政府，在经济上也会强大起来，我们能够克服一切过渡性的困难。
    帝国主义者想把匈牙利从社会主义阵营中拉出去的计划破产了。我们将坚决地击退所有干涉匈牙利内政的阴谋。坚信社会主义阵营的团结是不可摧毁的。
    亲爱的同志们，尊敬的听众们！
    最后，我再回过来谈一谈国际问题。帝国主义者们想把匈牙利从社会主义阵营中拉出去的计划破产了，他们很恨我们并且想尽办法来破坏匈牙利人民共和国的事业。很遗憾，为了实现他们的目的，他们利用联合国作为工具。大家知道，在美国的提议下，联合国大会选举了一个五人委员会审查所谓由他们所制造的“匈牙利问题”。这个委员会的作用是在于损害匈牙利人民共和国的主权与干涉匈牙利内政。我们的政府在给联合国秘书长的照会里对此曾经提出抗议。我可以宣布，我们政府在今后也将以同样的坚决击退所有干涉匈牙利内政的阴谋，正像我们从前所做的一样。
    我们希望联合国能从事于为人类的和平和匈牙利人民的和平与安宁的有益的问题，例如从事裁军，禁止和消灭原子和氢武器问题，或者是研究帝国主义对埃及的侵略，对匈牙利人民共和国和其他人民民主国家所进行的帝国主义的破坏和颠覆活动的问题，这在人民眼中将更好地提高联合国的威信，同时也更有益于人类。我们认为，如果联合国最后给了那迟早总要给的中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位，那么，这也会提高联合国的威信和改进它的工作。
    亲爱的同志们！
    正如国际帝国主义在策划推翻匈牙利人民共和国的反革命的进攻中起着决定性的作用，在挽救匈牙利社会主义的革命中，按照无产阶级国际主义的精神，苏联和支持我们事业的社会主义的阵营也有同样的决定性的作用。因此，在那些有我们党和政府的代表的国际的会谈上，特别是1月1日布达佩斯五国党和政府的会谈上和1月10日在莫斯科的中、匈、苏的会谈上，我们的代表坚信由无产阶级国际主义思想所联合起来的社会主义阵营不可摧毁的团结。
    我们忠实于无产阶级国际主义的思想，我们忠实于社会主义阵营的团结，因为这是我们马克思列宁主义世界观的要求，因为这是服务于我们的人民，我们的工人政权，我们人民共和国和我们社会主义的前途。
    亲爱的同志们！
    我们感觉到，我们每一个人都带着对社会主义革命事业坚定不移的信心，加强无产阶级国际主义的精神，并带着对马克思列宁主义旗帜的不可战胜的信心离开这个会走向工作。
    我们请求周恩来同志，和中国政府代表团全体人员，把我们的这个信息带给你们伟大的祖国和兄弟般的中国人民。
