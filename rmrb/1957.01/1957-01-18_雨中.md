    The bus from Chaigoubao to Huaian City leaves every morning at six o'clock. It rained last night, and although the rain stopped early this morning, a call came from Huaian City saying that it had rained heavily there last night and the road was difficult to travel, so they asked us to delay the departure. Therefore, today's bus was changed to depart at eight o'clock.

    The first to board was an old woman who was so sick that she couldn't walk. Two people carried her onto the bus and laid her down in the place that had been prepared for her with a quilt. Next to board were some women and old men holding children, followed by young and middle-aged people. The bus was crowded with people and luggage. The last few people to get on had to struggle to find a foothold.

    Once all the passengers were seated, a robust young man, dark-skinned and wearing faded old military uniform, climbed up the ladder and said to the passengers:

    "We're about to leave! Let's elect a safety team leader!" After a while, no one said a word. He pointed to a tall, middle-aged man wearing a blue shirt and military trousers and said, "How about him?" The people on the bus all said in unison, "Agreed!" The tall man smiled and didn't say anything. The young man handed him the red armband embroidered with the three white characters "Safety Team." He extended his large hand to shake hands with the tall man and said to him, "Please take good care of the old woman. She's sick and has no relatives to accompany her." After saying that, he went down, moved the ladder away, and went into the driver's cab. The engine roared, and the bus started.

    The bus twisted and turned out of the town and climbed onto the highway. Everyone was talking and looking at the scenery, and they forgot about the crowding. But before long, it started to rain again. People became restless. Some took out raincoats and put them on; some opened umbrellas, but couldn't hold them, and put them down again; some were packing their belongings, afraid they would get wet. The rain was getting heavier and heavier. Fortunately, the bus had a tarpaulin. The tall man pulled the tarpaulin out from under him, spread it over everyone's heads, and covered the entire carriage.

    After a while, the bus stopped. The driver shouted from below: "Comrades, we have to cross a ditch ahead. The weather is bad today, and the road is slippery, making the ditch difficult to cross. For everyone's safety, please get off the bus..."

    This was a difficult thing to ask. Getting off the bus meant rain and mud... Was it really necessary to get off? ... People were hesitant and watching. But the driver had already lifted the tarpaulin, and the tall man was also persuading everyone to get off. By this time, the rain had lessened. The young men jumped off the bus one by one first, and the single women also got off, followed by several old men. Only a few women holding children and the sick old woman remained on the bus.

    "Don't they need to get off?" the tall man asked the driver.

    "They have to get off," the driver said. "The ditch is steep, the road is slippery, for safety..."

    "If you drive slowly, there won't be any..."

    "Better safe than sorry. The weather is bad, what can we do!"

    "Okay, get off, sisters-in-law!" the tall man said to the mothers of the children. "This is for everyone's safety..."

    With the help of the tall man and the driver, the children and their mothers also got off the bus.

    "Comrade," the driver called to the tall man.

    "I need your help with something, that old woman..."

    "She has to get off too?"

    "She has to get off!"

    "That won't do," the tall man's face darkened. "She's too sick to move!"

    "For safety..."

    "I object!"

    "Better safe than sorry." The driver didn't budge. "If she can't move, I'll carry her!" As he spoke, he got on the bus.

    "It's not right to not take care of the sick!" the tall man became agitated. "If you don't have the skills to drive, then don't!"

    "No skills!" This angered the young man. He climbed onto the bus, turned around, and said to the crowd: "If you want to talk about skills, you have to go to the Korean battlefield to see! Not to brag, the American devils' planes, cannons, and searchlights were so suffocating, but didn't we still drive? Didn't we still deliver food and weapons to our soldiers? Not to brag, we even played hide-and-seek and joked with the enemy! Now it's not war, we're not joking. Now, we only talk about responsibility, not skills. I'll carry the old woman!"

    As he spoke, the young man turned around. The tall man also climbed onto the bus. The old woman was still lying there with her eyes closed, not saying a word. The tall man touched her forehead and asked her how she was. The old woman opened her eyes, nodded, and still didn't speak. They helped her up, the driver carried her on his back, and the tall man supported them as they got off the bus, holding up an umbrella to shield them from the rain. Stepping on the muddy, slippery road, they crossed the ditch. The tall man took the old woman from the driver and carried her on his own back, and the driver walked back across the ditch.

    People watched as the bus drove across the ditch. The driver drove very carefully, but did not encounter any difficulties. He got off the bus, took the old woman back and carried her onto the bus.

    He and the tall man helped the women and old men onto the bus. The young men also swarmed on.

    At this time, the tall man approached the driver and said, "Comrade, don't underestimate people. I also spent a lot of time in Korea."

    The driver blinked his bright eyes, looked at the tall man, and said, "So, we're old comrades-in-arms!" He stretched out his large hand and firmly grasped the other's slender hand.

    "I drove a car in the army, what about you?"

    "I work in the health department."

    "Ah, you're a medical worker! No wonder you have such a good heart!"

    "Your heart isn't bad either! Comrade."

    They smiled at each other and got on the bus.

    The rain had stopped sometime ago. The bus headed towards the ancient little city.

    雨中
    冯健男
    从柴沟堡到怀安城的汽车，每天早晨六点钟就开车。昨夜下雨，今天一大早虽说雨停下来了，怀安城打来电话，说那边昨夜雨大，路不好走，叫这边迟些发车，所以今天的车改在八点开了。
    第一个上车的是一位病得已不能行走的老太太，两个人把她抬上车去，让她在给她铺好了被子的地方躺了下来；接着上车的是一些抱着小孩的妇女和老汉；然后是青壮年。车上人多，行李也多，挤得很厉害，最后上去的几个人，费了很大劲才插下脚去。
    所有的乘客都坐好了，一位黑里透红、穿着褪了色的旧军装的壮健青年，爬上了梯子，对乘客们说：
  “就开车啦！大伙选个安全组长吧！”好一会也没人吱声，他就指着一位上身穿蓝衣服、下身穿军服裤子的高个儿中年人说：“就是这位，行不行哪？”车上的人们都异口同声地说：“赞成！”高个儿笑着不言语，小伙子把那绣着“安全组”三个白字的红袖章递给他。伸出大手来和高个儿握了握，对他说：“请多照顾那老太太，病着哪，又没亲人伴送。”说罢就走了下去，把梯子挪开，走进了驾驶室，机器一阵轰鸣，车开了。
    车转弯抹角地出了镇子，爬上了公路。大家说着话儿，看着景致儿，也就忘了挤了。但是走不多时，又下起雨来。人们骚动起来：有的拿起雨衣披上；有的撑开了伞，但撑不住，又放下；有的在收拾自己的包裹，怕它们被雨淋坏了。雨却越下越大。幸好车上还带着一块雨布，那高个儿从他身下把雨布抽出来，在大家头上撒开，把整个车厢盖了起来。
    走了好一阵，车停了，只听得司机在下边嚷道：“同志们，前面要过沟，今儿天气不好，路滑，沟不好过，为了大伙的安全，请大伙下车……”
    这倒是一件叫人为难的事情。一下车，又是雨，又是泥，……难道非下车不可么？……人们都在迟疑观望，但是司机已经把雨布掀开了，高个儿也劝大家下去。这时雨已下小了，小伙子们先一个一个跳下车，单身妇女们也下了车，接着，几个老汉也下车了。车上只剩下几个抱着孩子的妇女和那个病老太太。
    “她们不用下吧？”高个儿问司机。
    “得下。”司机说。“沟陡，路滑，为了安全……”
    “你慢慢开，哪里就会……”
    “不怕一万，只怕万一。天气不好，有什么法子！”
    “好，下吧，大嫂子们！”高个儿对孩子的妈妈们说。“这是为大伙安全……”
    在高个儿和司机的帮助之下，孩子们和妈妈们也都下车了。
    “同志”，司机招呼高个儿说。
    “还要你帮一下忙，那位老太太……”
    “她也得下？”
    “也得下！”
    “那可不成。”高个儿的脸沉了下来。“她病得不能动呀！”
    “为了安全，……”
    “我反对！”
    “不怕一万，只怕万一。”司机一点也不动摇。“她不能动，我背！”说着就上车。
    “不照顾病人还行！”高个儿急了，“没本事开车就别开！”
    “没本事！”这可把小伙子激恼了。他爬上车去，转过身来，对着众人说：“要说本事，你得上朝鲜战场瞧去！不是吹，美国鬼子的飞机、炮弹、探照灯，逼得人透不过气，咱还不是照样开车？粮食、武器，还不是照样送到咱们战士手里？不是吹，还要跟敌人捉捉迷藏，开开玩笑哩！现在不是打仗，咱不开玩笑。现在，咱只讲责任，不讲本事，我背老太太去！”
    小伙子说着就转过身去了。高个儿也爬上车去。老太太还是闭着眼睛，一声不响地躺在那里。高个儿在她额头上摸了摸，问她怎么样了，老太太张开眼，点点头，还是不说话。他们把她扶了起来，司机把她背在背上，高个儿扶着他们下了车，撑开伞给他们遮雨。踏着泥泞的、溜滑的道路，过了沟，高个儿从司机手中接过老太太来，背在自己的背上，司机就又走过沟去。
    人们眼看着汽车开过沟来。司机开得很小心，但并没有遇到困难。他下了车，又接过老太太来背上，把她送上车去。
    他和高个儿一起帮助妇女们老汉们上了车。小伙子们也一拥而上。
    这时，高个儿挨近了司机说：“同志，别小看人，朝鲜咱也没有少待。”
    司机眨着明亮的眼睛，看了高个儿一眼，说：“这样说，咱们是老战友啦！”他伸开大手，一把握住了对方的瘦长的手。
    “我在部队里就开汽车，你呢？”
    “在卫生部门工作。”
    “呵，你是医务人员！怪不得心肠那么好！”
    “你的心肠也不坏呀！同志。”
    他们互相笑了笑，就都上了车。
    雨，不知在什么时候停了。汽车向着那古老的小城驶去。
