    First Year in the Great Northern Wilderness
    Zhang Guocai is a 25-year-old young farmer. In February 1956, he led his younger brother and sister-in-law from Anhui Province to Yong'an Township, Jixian County, Heilongjiang Province, to live and join the Xinghua Agricultural Cooperative here. At that time, he had nothing, but with the enthusiastic help of the co-op members, he solved the difficulties of food and clothing.
    The two brothers worked very actively in the co-op, earning a total of more than 400 workdays. Adding in the forty or so workdays earned by their sister-in-law, the whole family could earn more than 1,000 yuan. Now, they have made three sets of brand-new cotton-padded coats and trousers, as well as two large floral quilts. Furniture such as pots, bowls, ladles, and basins have also been fully equipped. In October 1956, their sister-in-law gave birth to a chubby baby, and the two brothers couldn't stop grinning. They happily said, "The Great Northern Wilderness is really a good place. Everyone says that people from inside the pass can't adapt to the climate here, but we have only been here for a year and already have both prosperity and offspring, a double blessing."

    到北大荒第一年
    张国采是一个二十五岁的青年农民。1956年2月，他领着弟弟和弟媳妇由安徽省迁移到黑龙江省的集贤县永安乡居住，并参加了这里的兴华农业社。当时，他一无所有，在社员们的热情帮助下，解决了衣食上的困难。
    他们哥俩在社里干活很积极，共挣了四百多个劳动日，加上弟媳妇挣的四十来个劳动日，全家可收入一千多元钱。现在，他们做了三套里表崭新的棉袄和棉裤，还做了两床大花被。锅、碗、瓢、盆等家具，也都添置齐全了。在1956年10月间，弟媳妇生了个胖娃娃，哥俩乐的连嘴都闭不上了。他们高兴地说：“北大荒真是个好地方，都说关里人到这不服水土，可是我们刚来一年就人财两旺，双喜临门。”
