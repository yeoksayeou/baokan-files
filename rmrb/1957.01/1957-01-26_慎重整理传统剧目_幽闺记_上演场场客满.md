Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 24th: A classical Sichuan Opera traditional repertoire piece, "The Tale of Two Grooms" ("You Gui Ji"), which was once considered "not a box office draw," has recently been performed by the Chongqing Sichuan Opera Troupe in Chengdu, and is playing to full houses every night. Even the theater staff who had previously advised the troupe to reduce the number of performances are surprised.

The current performances are of the fourth revised version recently completed by the Chongqing Sichuan Opera Troupe, which includes many vivid plot points that were cut in previous versions. This version includes eight scenes such as "Stepping with an Umbrella," "Storming the Stockade," "Worshipping the Moon," and "Reunion." Through vivid and tortuous plots, the play portrays the steadfast love between young lovers Jiang Shilong and Wang Ruilan amidst the chaos of war.

"The Tale of Two Grooms" was originally a famous work called "The Moon-Worshipping Pavilion" by Yuan Dynasty playwright Guan Hanqing, and has been widely circulated among the people of Sichuan for many years. From 1950 onwards, the Chongqing Municipal Opera Improvement Association and the Experimental Sichuan Opera Troupe (now renamed the Chongqing Sichuan Opera Troupe) began organizing and revising the script. During the revisions, although the vulgar and erotic elements that had been incorporated into the play during performances in the old society were eliminated, making it a healthy and lyrical drama, the excellent work was also damaged. For example, in order to make the love between the male and female protagonists "more ideologically grounded," the revision inappropriately strengthened the national contradictions that were only background information in Guan Hanqing's original work. In the "Storming the Stockade" scene, the original only used this event to test the love between Wang and Jiang, but the revision made Wang Ruilan scold the emperor for no reason and sympathize with the "bandits" in the stockade. Later, when the two young people stayed in a hotel, an interesting dispute arose over whether to share a room or not. This section originally reflected how they broke through the shackles of feudal ethics, but it was considered close to pornography and was deleted. Many scenes and lines in the play that were full of life's interest were also removed under judgments unrelated to the theme.

In the fourth quarter of last year, the Chongqing Sichuan Opera Troupe reorganized this repertoire.

### 慎重整理传统剧目  “幽闺记”上演场场客满

    慎重整理传统剧目
    “幽闺记”上演场场客满
    据新华社成都24日电　一出被认为“不叫座”的川剧古典传统剧目“幽闺记”，最近由重庆市川剧院在成都市上演时竟场场客满。曾经劝说过剧院少演几场的剧场人员也很惊奇。
    这次演出的是重庆市川剧院最近完成的第四次整理本，其中有许多生动情节，以前的整理本都删改了。这次的整理本有踏伞、闯寨、拜月、重逢等八场。剧本通过生动、曲折的情节，刻划了在战乱中的青年男女蒋世隆和王瑞兰坚贞的爱情。
    “幽闺记”原本是元代剧作家关汉卿的名著“拜月亭”，许多年来一直在四川民间广泛流传。1950年起，重庆市戏曲改进会和实验川剧院（现改为重庆市川剧院）就先后开始整理。整理中，虽然剔除了这个戏在旧社会演出过程中掺进的庸俗色情成分，使它成为健康的抒情剧，但是，也使这个优秀剧目受到了损伤。例如为了使男女主角的爱情“更有思想基础”，整理本不适当地加强了关汉卿原著中仅作背景交代的民族矛盾。“闯寨”一场，原作只是使王、蒋二人的爱情经受一次考验，而整理本竟让王瑞兰无缘无故地骂皇帝，同情起山寨中的“贼人”来。这两个青年后来投宿旅店，为了同房不同房的问题发生有趣的争执，这一节本来反映出他们如何突破封建礼教的束缚，可是却被认为近于色情，一笔删掉。剧中好些富有生活情趣的情节和词句，也在与主题无关的判语下被清除了。
    去年第四季度，重庆市川剧院重新整理了这个剧目。
