    The Kyrgyz People Have Their Own Newspaper

    (Our Dispatch) The first newspaper printed in the Kyrgyz language, "Kyzylsu," was launched on New Year's Day this year, which is a joyous event in the cultural life of the Kyrgyz people. The nomadic Kyrgyz people live in the Kizilsu Kyrgyz Autonomous Prefecture. They had no written language in the past. After the liberation of Xinjiang, with the care of the Party and the government, relevant departments helped them create a written language in July last year. The publication of the newspaper printed in the Kyrgyz language will encourage the Kyrgyz people to advance towards socialism. (Yang Xueshu)

    柯尔克孜族有了自己的报纸
    本报讯　第一次用柯尔克孜文排印的“克孜勒苏”报在今年元旦创刊，这是柯尔克孜族人民文化生活中的一件喜事。从事游牧的柯尔克孜族人民聚居在克孜勒苏柯尔克孜自治州，他们过去没有文字，新疆解放后，在党和政府的关怀下，由有关部门帮助他们在去年7月创造了文字。用柯尔克孜文字排印的报纸出版后，将鼓舞着柯尔克孜人民向社会主义前进。　（杨学书）
