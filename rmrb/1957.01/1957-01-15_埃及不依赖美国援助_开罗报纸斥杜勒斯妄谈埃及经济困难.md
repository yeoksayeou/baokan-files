Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 14th: Cairo newspapers on the 13th sharply criticized US Secretary of State Dulles' remarks on the economic situation of Middle Eastern countries when testifying before the Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee. The newspapers refuted Dulles' claim that the Egyptian economy was in a difficult situation.

　　“Al-Ahram” said: “Our economy is solid and healthy. It is healthy because it does not rely on aid from the United States and Britain... Our economic relations with friendly countries are constantly strengthening and expanding. The large-scale purchase of our cotton by friendly countries is the best proof.”

　　The newspaper said that Mr. Dulles spoke of the Egyptian economy as if Egypt had requested economic assistance. The newspaper emphasized that Egypt does not need US aid, it has not requested such aid in the past, and it does not intend to request aid in the future.

　　“Al-Gomhouria” emphasized in its commentary that Egypt's economy does not depend on what policies the United States adopts towards Egypt, because Egypt's trade relations with friendly countries are the determining factor in Egypt's economy. This relationship is strengthening and expanding day by day. It pointed out: "Egypt has not asked the United States for financial assistance. It only asks for its rights to the dollars it owns in foreign countries."

　　“Al-Shaab” and “Al-Akhbar” also strongly criticized Dulles' speech.

    埃及不依赖美国援助
    开罗报纸斥杜勒斯妄谈埃及经济困难
    新华社14日讯　开罗消息：开罗各报13日尖锐抨击美国国务卿杜勒斯在国会外交委员会作证时就中东国家的经济状况所作的发言。报纸驳斥杜勒斯说埃及经济处于困难境地这种说法。
      “金字塔报”说：“我们的经济是稳固和健康的。它所以是健康的，因为它不依赖美国和英国的援助……我们同各友好国家的经济关系正在不断加强和扩大。友好国家大量购买我们的棉花就是最好的证明。”
    这家报纸说，杜勒斯先生谈到埃及经济，好像埃及要求经济援助。报纸强调指出，埃及不需要美国援助，它过去没有请求过这种援助，就是今后也不打算请求援助。
    “共和国报”在评论中强调指出，埃及的经济并不取决于美国对埃及采取什么样的政策，因为埃及目前同各友好国家的贸易关系正是埃及经济中的决定因素。这种关系正在日益加强和更加扩大。它指出：“埃及并没有要求美国给予财政援助。它只要求它对在外国所存的美元拥有的权利。”
    “人民报”和“消息报”也强烈地批评杜勒斯的发言。
