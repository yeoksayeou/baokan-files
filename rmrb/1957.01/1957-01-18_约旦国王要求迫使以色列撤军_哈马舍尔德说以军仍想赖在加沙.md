Xinhua News Agency, January 17th dispatch from Beirut: According to Beirut radio broadcasts, Jordanian King Hussein, when meeting with reporters from a newspaper in Amman on the 15th, said that Israeli troops should be forced to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and other locations on the Sinai Peninsula they occupy.

Commenting on the "Eisenhower Doctrine," Hussein said that Jordan "insists on its views and will continue to act from its nationalism and its interests."

In early January, according to sources at the Jordanian Royal Palace, Jordanian King Hussein told the U.S. Ambassador to Jordan that Arab countries would fill any "vacuum" in the Middle East themselves and would not allow foreign countries to fill it.

Xinhua News Agency, January 17th dispatch from New York: United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld reported to the United Nations General Assembly on the 16th that his negotiations with Israeli representatives regarding the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops who invaded Egypt had not been successful. He said that Israel still demands to continue to control the Gaza Strip and a strip of land on the western coast of the Gulf of Aqaba.

Hammarskjöld said that the United Nations General Assembly's resolution in November of last year "clearly stated that Israeli troops must withdraw behind the armistice line, as stipulated in the Egyptian-Israeli agreement." He said that according to this agreement, the Gaza Strip belongs to the Egyptian side of the armistice line.

Hammarskjöld also said that further negotiations must be held with Israel on the issue of troop withdrawal, because the withdrawal of Israeli troops behind the armistice line is a prerequisite and very important condition for restoring peace in Egypt.

    约旦国王要求迫使以色列撤军
    哈马舍尔德说以军仍想赖在加沙
    新华社17日讯　贝鲁特消息：据贝鲁特电台广播，约旦国王侯赛尼在15日接见安曼的一家报纸的记者时说，应当迫使以色列军队从加沙地带和他们所占据的西奈半岛上的其他地点撤退。
    侯赛尼在评论“艾森豪威尔主义”的时候说，约旦“坚持它的观点，并且将继续从它的民族主义和它的利益采取行动。”
    在1月上旬，据约旦王宫人士说，约旦国王侯赛尼曾经对美国驻约旦大使说过，阿拉伯国家将自己来填补中东的任何“真空”，而不允许外国来填补。
    新华社17日讯　纽约消息：联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德16日向联合国大会提出报告说，他同以色列代表举行的关于全部撤退以色列侵略埃及的军队的谈判没有成功。他说，以色列仍然要求继续控制加沙地带和亚喀巴湾西部海岸上的一条地带。
    哈马舍尔德说，联合国大会去年11月的决议“明确表示，以色列部队必须撤退到停战线后面，因为这是在埃及—以色列协定中所规定了的”。他说，根据这一协定，加沙地带属于停战线的埃及一边。
    哈马舍尔德还说，在撤退军队问题上，必须和以色列举行进一步的谈判，因为以色列部队撤退到停战线后面是恢复埃及和平的一个先决的和非常重要的条件。
