    Chinese Tallow Tree
    The Chinese tallow tree is an oil crop abundant in the mountainous areas of southern Anhui Province. Local farmers have a saying: "Seventeen from the inside, eighteen from the outside." This means that one dan of tallow seeds can yield seventeen jin of green oil from the kernels and eighteen jin of outer wax oil. The green oil can be used for lighting lamps, lubricating machines, and as a paint material, while the wax oil can be used to make candles and soap.
    The Chinese tallow tree is a deciduous tree. Its wood is white with a diagonal, fine grain, making it an excellent material for woodblock printing and carving tools. The leaves can be used as dye and fertilizer. The picture shows Zhang Yaogui, a member of the Xinzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in She County, using a crescent knife to harvest tallow seeds from the tree. Photo by Ke Zhongjun

    乌桕
    乌桕，是一种油料作物，盛产在安徽省南部的山区。这里的农民有“里十七外十八”的说法。就是一担桕子的仁能榨出十七斤青油，外面白腊层能榨出十八斤皮油。青油可供点灯、擦机器和作漆料；皮油可制蜡烛、肥皂等。
    乌桕系落叶乔木，木材色白，纹理斜行、细腻，是刻书制版和雕刻器具的良材；叶子可做染料和肥料。图是歙县新庄农业社社员章耀贵在树上用月牙刀采桕子。　柯仲俊　摄
