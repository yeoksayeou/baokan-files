	To thoroughly ascertain the inventory and rationally arrange production, the State Economic Commission, the Ministry of Supervision, and the State Statistical Bureau jointly inspected stock materials, and in the inspection, a large batch of unreported steel, timber, and other materials was discovered.

	According to our report, at the end of last year, the above-mentioned three units jointly issued a notice on doing a good job of inventory census and handling surplus stock materials. After receiving the notice, most departments and provinces and cities quickly made arrangements and dispatched many cadres to form inspection teams to conduct in-depth inspections of key areas. In addition to arranging for its subordinate units to conduct inspections, Shanxi Province determined that Vice Governor Jiao would personally lead this work, and more than 60 cadres were drawn from the Provincial Supervision Department, the Statistical Bureau, the Materials Supply Bureau, and other units to conduct spot checks in key units in groups. In addition to arranging for 83 enterprises to organize self-inspections, Hunan Province also organized more than 60 cadres from the Provincial Supervision Department, the Planning Commission, the Statistical Bureau, the Materials Supply Bureau, and other units to conduct spot checks in 25 state-owned and local state-owned enterprises. However, a few units did not pay enough attention to this inspection, and some still had some ideological concerns and resistance.

	Judging from the preliminary situation discovered in spot checks of certain key units, the phenomenon of omissions and errors in the material inventory census on January 1 this year in many units is quite serious. According to the preliminary statistics of 16 units including the Beijing Timber Factory, the Metal Structure Factory, and the Guanghua Timber Factory, which were systemically sampled and inspected in Beijing, more than 2,500 tons of unreported steel, more than 14,900 cubic meters of logs and boards, more than 7,800 tons of cement, as well as many materials such as bearings and furnace pieces were found. According to very incomplete statistics from spot checks of several engineering bureaus, the Ministry of Railways has also discovered more than 2,000 tons of unreported steel rails, more than 24,000 sleepers, as well as some steel, timber, cement, and other materials. Preliminary spot checks of six state-owned enterprises and warehouses in the Tianjin area revealed a total of more than 700 tons of underreported steel and more than 80 tons of non-ferrous metals. The proportion of omissions in some units is quite large. For example, a state-owned factory in Tianjin stated in its census report on January 1 this year that it had 250 tons of ferrous metals and 63 tons of non-ferrous metals. However, this time it was found that 215 tons of ferrous metals and 34 tons of non-ferrous metals were unreported. The Luoyang Engineering Office of the Second Engineering Company of the Building Materials Industry Department actually had more than 300 tons of steel and more than 3,500 cubic meters of timber, but only more than 200 tons of steel and more than 900 cubic meters of timber were reported in the census report.

	These situations show that the material inventory census in many units is not real, the inventory is unclear, and the management is chaotic. In this census, some units did not conduct careful inventory and cleanup, resulting in the widespread situation of unclear inventory and discrepancies between accounts, cards, and materials; some units did not report according to the regulations of the State Statistical Bureau, especially many materials awaiting inspection and entry into accounts, materials stored in workshops and construction sites that have not yet been consumed, and materials entrusted to other units for custody or entrusted to other units for processing, which were not included in the statistics as required; some units also had many calculation errors, and some even omitted the materials of the entire unit when summarizing; among them, some units were also guided by departmentalism, playing tricks, discounting, and concealing underreporting. In order to effectively correct these phenomena and further improve material management, relevant departments are continuing to conduct investigations.

    切实摸清家底合理安排生产
    经委、监察部、统计局联合检查库存物资
    查出大批漏报的钢材木材
    本报讯　国家经济委员会、监察部、国家统计局为了切实弄清家底，联合检查了库存物资，在检查中，查出了大批漏报钢材和木材等材料。
    去年年底上述三个单位曾联合发出了关于作好库存普查和处理多余库存物资的通知。各部门和各省市在接到通知后，大都迅速作了布置，并且抽调了许多干部组成了检查组，深入重点进行检查。山西省除了布置所属单位进行检查外，并确定由焦副省长亲自领导这一工作，从省监察厅、统计局、物资供应局等单位抽调了六十多名干部，分组深入重点单位进行抽查。湖南省除了布置八十三个企业组织自查外，也由省监察厅、计划委员会、统计局、物资供应局等单位，组织了六十多名干部，深入二十五个国营和地方国营企业重点抽查。但是也有少数单位对这次检查不够重视，有的还存在着一些思想顾虑和抵触情绪。
    从抽查某些重点单位所发现的初步情况看，不少单位今年1月1日物资库存普查中，漏报、错报的现象是相当严重的。根据北京市系统抽查的北京市木材厂、金属结构厂、光华木材厂等十六个单位的初步统计，共查出漏报钢材二千五百多吨，原木、板材等一万四千九百多立方公尺，水泥七千八百多吨，以及轴承、炉片等许多物资。铁道部根据几个工程局抽查中很不完整的统计，也已经发现漏报钢轨二千多吨，枕木二万四千多根，以及一部分钢材、木材、水泥等材料。天津地区六个国营企业和仓库初步抽查结果，共少报钢材七百多吨，有色金属八十多吨。有些单位漏报的比重相当大。如天津某国营工厂，在今年1月1日的普查报告中说有黑色金属二百五十吨，有色金属六十三吨。但是这次查出来漏报的黑色金属就有二百一十五吨，有色金属三十四吨。建筑材料工业部第二工程公司洛阳工程处，实际上有钢材三百多吨，木材三千五百多立方公尺，但是普查报告中只上报钢材二百多吨，木材九百多立方公尺。
    这些情况说明许多单位物资库存普查不实，家底不清，管理混乱的情况还是相当严重的。有些单位在这次普查中没有认真进行盘点清理，以致库存不清，账、卡、料不符的情况普遍存在；有些单位没有根据国家统计局的规定统计上报，尤其是许多待验收入账的，存放在车间、工地尚未耗用的，委托其他单位代管或其他单位委托加工的材料，没有按照规定统计进去；有些单位计算差错的情况也很多，有的在汇总时甚至把整个单位的材料都漏了；其中也有一些单位是在本位主义的思想指导下，打埋伏，打折扣，隐瞒少报。为了切实纠正这些现象，进一步改进材料管理工作，有关部门仍在继续进行清查中。
