Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 26th – Workers at the state-owned Taiyuan Paper Mill, after more than half a month of discussion, recently found a way to solve the problem of raw material shortages. Once these methods are implemented, they will not only solve the raw material shortage for completing this year's national plan, but also increase paper production by more than 550 tons.

The Taiyuan Paper Mill's production target for this year has increased by 41.6% compared to last year, but the raw materials allocated by the state are only equivalent to slightly more than 70% of the required amount. The key problem in completing this year's production task is the shortage of raw materials. Therefore, the mill's leadership launched a discussion among workers focusing on this critical issue. Workers in the pulp-making workshop suggested using more waste materials such as old shoe uppers, shoe soles, and rags to expand the mill's pulp production capacity, which could reduce the use of externally sourced pulp. Workers in the paper-making workshop proposed using more white water and recycled material from under the wire mesh to reduce pulp loss, increasing the use of talc powder, and improving the method of adding talc powder. According to experiments and calculations, these measures can reduce the amount of pulp used per ton of paper by 117 kilograms compared to last year, saving more than 200 tons of pulp throughout the year.

After calculation, the technical measures proposed by all the workers, once implemented, will not only make up for the shortage of raw materials to complete this year's plan but will also leave a large surplus. Therefore, the mill decided to fully utilize these favorable factors for increasing production, and in addition to ensuring the completion of this year's national plan, it will further increase paper production by 557 tons.

    太原造纸厂依靠职工解决原料不足问题
    新华社太原26日电　国营太原造纸厂职工经过半个多月的讨论，最近找到了解决原料不足的办法。这些办法实现以后，不但可以解决完成今年国家计划所缺少的原料问题，而且还能再增产纸张五百五十多吨。
    太原造纸厂今年的生产任务比去年增加了41.6％，但是国家分配给的原料只等于需要量的70％多，完成今年的生产任务遇到的关键问题便是原料不足。于是这个厂的领导部门便发动职工围绕这一关键问题展开讨论。制浆车间的职工在讨论中提出了多用破鞋帮、鞋底、烂布等废物，扩大本厂纸浆生产量的有关技术措施，可以减少外来浆的使用量；抄造车间的职工提出了多用白水和网下回料，减少浆料流失，加大滑石粉的使用量和改进加滑石粉的方法等一系列技术措施。根据试验和测算，这些措施可以使每吨纸比去年少用一百一十七公斤浆料，全年就能节约二百多吨浆料。
    经过计算，全厂职工提出的技术措施实现以后，不但能够弥补完成今年计划所不足的原料，还有很大一部分剩余。因此，这个厂决定充分利用这些增产的有利因素，除了保证完成今年的国家计划以外，再增产五百五十七吨纸。
