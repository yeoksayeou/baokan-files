Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, January 19th: Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their entourage arrived in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, by plane at 12:00 noon today.

Premier Zhou Enlai is visiting the country at the invitation of the Afghan Royal Government.

Premier Zhou Enlai was welcomed at the airport by Afghan Prime Minister Daoud Khan. The band played the national anthems of China and Afghanistan, and Zhou Enlai and He Long, accompanied by Daoud Khan, reviewed the honor guard. Subsequently, Zhou Enlai met with Afghan cabinet ministers and the diplomatic corps stationed in Kabul. A group of children in brightly colored national costumes smilingly presented flowers to the Chinese leaders. Chinese Ambassador Ding Guoyu and embassy staff were also present.

Some tall tents were erected at the airport, which is surrounded by snow-capped mountains.

In his welcoming address, Prime Minister Daoud Khan said that Zhou Enlai's visit comes "at a time when people feel more than ever the need for international friendship and understanding." He expressed his confidence that the visit would help promote the current friendly relations between the people of the two countries.

He then said: Although you are visiting here during the severe winter, "we hope you will find the hospitality of the Afghan people in your hearts, and hope that the friendly light will dispel the severe cold of winter, making your visit to our country an unforgettable one."

In his reply, Premier Zhou Enlai thanked the Afghan government and people for their invitation and warm welcome, and conveyed his greetings to them in the name of the Chinese people. He said that although this was his first visit to the country, Afghanistan was not unfamiliar to the Chinese people. He spoke of the contiguous borders between the two countries and the history of interaction between the two peoples dating back to the distant past. Both countries had suffered from the scourge of colonialism, and both countries had waged long, arduous, but victorious struggles to safeguard their independence. He said: "Now we have formed a solid friendship in the noble cause of safeguarding world peace."

Premier Zhou Enlai agreed with Prime Minister Daoud Khan's view that international friendship and understanding are now of greater significance than ever before. At the same time, he expressed his hope that his visit "will not only help to enhance the friendship between China and Afghanistan, but also help promote peace in Asia and the world."

Premier Zhou Enlai then traveled by car to the Sadarat Palace, where they will be staying.

The road to the Sadarat Palace was adorned with festive decorations, with many red Chinese national flags and black, red, and green Afghan flags hanging. Arches were erected in several places. Many slogans were posted on the utility poles and welcoming pillars, written in Pashto and Chinese: "Welcome the leaders of the Chinese people," "Welcome the distinguished guests of Afghanistan," "May the friendship between the Afghan and Chinese people last forever," and so on.

On the snow-covered sidewalks of the streets, tens of thousands of Kabul citizens, villagers, and students were packed tightly. Some wore headscarves, some wore lambskin hats, wrapped in large scarves, and some wore striped coats. When the Chinese Premier's motorcade passed by, they cheered, applauded, and waved flags. When Zhou Enlai waved from the car, people cheered again and again.

    友好的光芒驱散了严冬的酷寒
    阿富汗首都热烈欢迎周总理
    新华社喀布尔19日电　周恩来总理、贺龙副总理以及随行人员在今天中午十二时乘飞机到达阿富汗首都喀布尔。
    周恩来总理是应阿富汗王国政府的邀请到这个国家进行友好访问的。
    周恩来总理在机场受到了阿富汗首相达乌德汗的欢迎。乐队奏起了中国和阿富汗国歌，周恩来和贺龙在达乌德汗的陪同下检阅了仪仗队。随后，周恩来同阿富汗内阁大臣和驻喀布尔的外交团见了面。穿着鲜艳的民族服装的一群儿童，笑嘻嘻地向中国领导人员献花。中国大使丁国钰和大使馆人员也在场。
    在雪山环抱的飞机场上，搭起了一些高大的帐篷。
    达乌德汗首相在致欢迎词的时候说，周恩来是“在人们比过去任何时期都更加感觉需要国际友好和谅解这样一个时期”来进行访问的。他表示确信，这次访问将有助于促进两国人民之间目前的友好关系。
    他接着说：虽然你们在严冬凛冽的时候到这里访问，“我们希望你们会在阿富汗人民的心中找到好客的热情，希望友好的光芒会驱散严冬的酷寒，而使你们在我们国家所进行的访问成为难忘的访问”。
    周恩来总理在致答辞时，感谢阿富汗政府和人民的邀请和热烈的欢迎，并且以中国人民的名义向他们致意。他说，虽然他是初次来访问这个国家，但是阿富汗对中国人并不是陌生的，他谈到两国国境相连，两国人民交往的历史可以追溯到遥远的过去，两国都曾经受到殖民主义者的祸害，两个国家为了维护自己的独立都曾经进行过长期的、艰苦的然而是胜利的斗争。他说：“现在我们又在维护世界和平的崇高事业中结成了巩固的友谊。”
    周恩来总理同意达乌德汗首相这样的看法：国际友好和谅解现在比过去任何时候有更重大的意义。同时，他表示希望他这次访问“不仅能够有助于增进中国同阿富汗的友谊，而且能够有助于亚洲和世界和平”。
    周恩来总理随即乘汽车前往萨达腊特宫，他们将住在那里。
    通往萨达腊特宫的道路披上了节日的盛装，挂着许多红色的中国国旗和黑红绿三色的阿富汗国旗。在好几个地方竖立了拱门。电线杆和为欢迎而设的立柱上贴着许多标语，上面用普什图文和中文写着：“欢迎中国人民的领袖们”、“欢迎阿富汗的贵宾”、“愿阿富汗和中国人民的友谊永存”等等。
    在大街上积雪未消的人行道上，成千上万的喀布尔市民、村民和学生挤得水泄不通。他们有的带着头巾，有的戴着羔羊皮帽，围着大围巾，有的穿着条纹长大衣。当中国总理一行通过的时候，他们就欢呼、鼓掌并且摇动旗子。当周恩来从车中招手致意的时候，人们又一阵阵地欢呼起来。
