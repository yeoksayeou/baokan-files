The Story of the Discovery of an Ancient City
江车 [Jiang Che]

Last September, the People's Daily published a news item about the discovery of a Shang Dynasty city site underground in Zhengzhou, stating that the discovery of the site would provide important data for the periodization of ancient Chinese history, and mentioning that archaeologists were searching for the complete remains of this ancient city along the rammed earth walls...

After arriving in Zhengzhou, I went to see the ruins of the ancient city, and what was even more interesting was hearing the story of the first person to discover this ancient city.

Han Weizhou had been doing archaeological work for five or six years before liberation, but at that time the scale was small, and he did not receive support from the reactionary government, so the work did not proceed smoothly, and later the few people dispersed.

In 1949, after studying, Han Weizhou went to teach in a primary school in Zhengzhou. At that time, he had a mistaken idea that everything in the new society should be new, and that old things like archaeology were not needed. Once, he casually talked about archaeology in the teachers' lounge, and some people ridiculed him. He was even criticized at a meeting. He mistakenly thought that the new society did not need archaeological work.

The school was near the old city of Zhengzhou, and he often went there for a walk in his spare time, sometimes going to the high slopes to look into the distance. Originally, he was just walking aimlessly, but every time he walked along the city wall, he would see some ancient tiles, some with obvious patterns. He wanted to pick them up and take them home for future research, but he never had the courage, fearing that others would criticize him if they knew. Many times, he left there with a sense of regret, thinking that he would never go to these places again. However, countless fragments of tiles had long occupied his heart, and he could not let go of those small things left on the ground.

Once, while teaching a history lesson, Han Weizhou cautiously revealed to his students that there were many precious national cultural relics in Zhengzhou. After that, a student picked up a rectangular polished stone from near the city wall. He was delighted to find that it was a stone sickle, but he could not determine which era it belonged to.

The stone sickle aroused his greater interest, and he still silently wandered around the old city. Once, he found a cord-marked pottery fragment on the city wall. Based on these two things, he tentatively concluded that it might be a relic from the Neolithic Age. However, even at this time, he still didn't dare to pick up a single pottery fragment.

In 1950, he saw a news item in the newspaper about archaeological researchers studying the Yin Ruins. This was truly an unexpected event. He regarded those few lines of print as an important discovery and shouted to the people at the school, "The new society also needs archaeology!"

When the students went to the suburbs to collect plants, he followed them. He ran to the old bunkers to excavate antiquities. This time, he brought back some pottery fragments. He felt a little nervous at the time, but also exceptionally lighthearted.

After obtaining these small things, he spent many happy and hard nights under the lamp. He went through various materials, repeatedly pondered them, and he also contacted his old colleagues who had been separated for many years, following the clues he got from the newspaper. They all wrote letters encouraging him to continue collecting materials and engaging in research. So every Sunday, he carried a small cloth bag and searched along the city wall, sometimes patrolling the suburbs in the wind and snow. People were surprised by his actions.

After walking around the old city, he discovered that there were these ancient relics all around, and he also discovered some important materials, such as oracle bones, stone tools, bone tools, etc. More importantly, he discovered the remains of Shang Dynasty rammed earth pits, and he concluded that this might be the site of an ancient Shang Dynasty city. He wrote a letter to his old colleagues telling them his judgment. After receiving unanimous agreement, he excitedly wrote a letter to the Zhengzhou City Cultural Center, but unfortunately, there was no response. This made Han Weizhou suspicious again. He thought a lot, but when he saw that some cultural relics had been damaged, he could no longer remain silent. He wrote another letter to the province. The province attached great importance to this matter and asked him to write a detailed report. When he received the letter from the province, he was very excited. He didn't know where to start...

In 1952, the Ministry of Culture sent many experts to appraise it, and finally confirmed Han Weizhou's discovery and judgment. In the winter of that year, the excavation work of the ancient city began. Han Weizhou, who was nearly fifty years old and enthusiastic about archaeology, was also transferred to the Henan Provincial Cultural Relics Work Team. The secret of the ancient city, buried underground for more than three thousand years, was first revealed by him in this way.

    发现古城的故事
    江车
    去年9月里，人民日报发表了一条郑州地下发现商代城址的消息，上面说城址的发现将为我国古代史分期问题提供重要资料，并且谈到考古工作者正沿着夯土墙寻找着这座古城的全部遗迹……。
    到郑州以后，我曾去看过古城的遗址，更有意思的是听说了关于第一个发现这座古城的人的故事。
    韩维周在解放前已经做了五六年的考古工作，但那时只是几个人的规模，又得不到反动政府的支持，因此工作进行的并不顺利，后来几个人就东西分散了。
    1949年，韩维周经过学习以后到郑州市的一个小学校去教书，当时他有一个错误的想法，以为新社会一切都要新的，考古这种旧东西是不需要的。有一次他在教员休息室偶然谈起考古的事，有人就讥讽他，甚至在一次会上还有人批评过他。他更加误以为新社会是不需要考古事业的了。
    学校靠近郑州的旧城，课余他常去那里散步，有时就走到高坡上去远眺。本来是无目的地去走走，但每次沿着城墙走过的时候，常会看到一些古代的瓦片，有的上面还有着明显的花纹。他看到了很想拾起来带回家去，以备日后研究，但他始终没有这个勇气，他惟恐别人知道了要批评他。有好多次，他都是带着一股惋惜的心情离开那里，并想以后决不再到这些地方来了。可是，无数个碎瓦片早已占据了他的心，他无论如何也放心不下那些遗留在地面上的小东西。
    有一次，在讲历史课时，韩维周小心地向同学们吐露了就在郑州有着不少宝贵的祖国文物的消息，这以后就有一个学生从城墙附近拾来一块长方形的磨光的石头，他欣喜地发现这是一个石镰刀，但他不能断定究竟是什么时代的。
    石镰刀引起了他更大的兴趣，他仍然一个人默默地跑到旧城附近去流连。有一回他又在城墙上发现了一块绳纹陶片，根据这两件东西，他初步断定可能是新石器时代的遗物，然而直到这时他仍然连一片陶片也没敢拾回来。
    1950年他从报纸上看到一条考古人员研究殷墟的消息，这真是件意外的事，他把那短短的几行铅字，当作一个重要的发现向学校的人们嚷道：“新社会也要考古！”
    学生们到郊外去采集植物，他也跟着去。他跑到旧碉堡里去挖掘古物，这次他才从那里带回来一些陶片，当时的心情有点紧张，但也是异常轻快的。
    得到这些小东西之后，他在灯下不知度过了多少愉快而又辛苦的夜晚，他翻遍各种资料，反复地琢磨着，他也按照从报上得到的线索和分手数年的老同事们取得了联系，人家都写信鼓励他继续搜集材料从事研究。于是每逢星期日他就带着一个小布口袋沿着城墙一路寻去，有时冒着风雪在城郊巡行，人家都为他这种行动而诧异。
    他沿着旧城走了一圈之后，发现四周都有这些古代遗物，而且还发现了一些重要资料，如卜骨、石器、骨器等，更重要的是发现了商代夯土窝的遗迹，他这才断定这里可能是商代古城的遗址。他把自己的判断写信告诉了老同事。等得到了一致的意见以后，他兴奋地给郑州市文化馆写了信，可惜一直没有下文。这又使韩维周多心起来，他想了很多，可是当他看到几件文物已经遭到破坏的时候，就再也沉默不下去了，他又给省里写了信。省里很重视这件事，并让他写个详细材料。当他接到省里的信以后，真是十分激动，他不知该从何说起才好……。
    1952年文化部派了许多专家来加以鉴定，最后证实了韩维周的发现和判断，就在那一年的冬天开始了古城的发掘工作。这位将近五十岁的热衷考古事业的韩维周也调到了河南省文物工作队来。埋藏在地下三千多年的古城的秘密就是这样由他第一个给揭开了的。
