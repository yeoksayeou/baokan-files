Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Many cooks and heating workers in the Chinese People's Liberation Army have continuously improved stoves and enhanced coal burning techniques, saving the country a large amount of coal in 1956.

The cooks in units stationed in the Nanjing area saved more than 6 million jin of coal in the first half of last year by improving stoves and fire-making methods. One cooking squad of a certain anti-aircraft unit used three stoves, with each stove saving 150 kilograms of coal per day. In the past, it took them several hours to boil a pot of soup, wasting a lot of coal. Later, they identified the problems with the stove and improved it, now only requiring 25 kilograms of coal to boil five dan of water in thirty minutes. Liu Yucai, a cook from a unit stationed in the Chengdu area, created an advanced fire-making experience: "Reduce the furnace chamber, add coal frequently and in small amounts, clean the ash lightly and seal the fire tightly, promptly remove ash accumulated under the stove to keep the furnace chamber airflow smooth, and increase firepower." After this experience was promoted in various units, many mess units saved 30,000 to 40,000 jin of coal per month.

Many heating workers in various agencies and units have become experts in saving coal. Zhou Yufu, the squad leader of the plumbing squad of the First Military Medical University, continuously created advanced fire-making methods such as "not removing red cinders when burning," "three-fast fire-making method" (open the door quickly, close the door quickly, add coal quickly) and "four-determination method" (determine temperature, determine time, determine steam pressure, determine coal quantity), saving 1,477 tons of coal for heating in a year. Zhou Yufu was named an advanced worker. His experience has been promoted and adopted in many units.

### 不断改进炉灶　提高烧煤技术  解放军节约大量用煤

    不断改进炉灶　提高烧煤技术
    解放军节约大量用煤
    新华社8日讯　中国人民解放军中的许多炊事人员和暖气工人不断地改进炉灶和提高烧煤技术，1956年为国家节约了大量用煤。
    驻南京地区部队的炊事员们由于改进了炉灶和烧火方法，在去年上半年节约用煤六百多万斤。防空军某部炊事班使用三个炉灶，每个炉灶每天节约一百五十公斤煤。过去，他们烧一锅汤需要几小时，浪费很多煤，后来找出炉灶的毛病加以改进，只需要二十五公斤煤在三十分钟内就能烧开五担开水了。驻成都地区部队某部炊事员刘玉才创造了“改小炉膛，勤添，少添煤，掏灰要轻、封火要严，及时清除灶下的积灰使炉膛空气流畅、增强火力”的先进烧火经验，这个经验在各部队推广以后，很多伙食单位每月都节约了三万到四万斤煤。
    许多机关、部队的暖气工人成为节约用煤的能手。第一军医大学的水暖班班长周玉福连续创造了“烧火时不掏红焦子”、“三快烧火法”（开门快、关门快、添煤快）和“四定办法”（定温度、定时间、定汽压、定煤量）等先进烧火方法，一年节约采暖用煤一千四百七十七吨。周玉福被评为先进工作者。他的经验已在许多部队中推广采用。
