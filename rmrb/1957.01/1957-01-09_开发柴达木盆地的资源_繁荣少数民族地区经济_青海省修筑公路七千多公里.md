Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 8th - In 1956, Qinghai Province built 3,226 kilometers of new highways. Including the highways built in the previous three years, the province completed a total of 7,047 kilometers of new highways, exceeding the province's road construction plan stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan.

The smooth flow of traffic has revitalized areas that were previously wilderness. The several highways built in the Qaidam area last year have basically formed a highway network in the basin. In this basin, only in Chaka alone, the number of vehicles passing through every day and night has reached 300, and a large number of exploration equipment and materials are transported into the basin from here.

In many pastoral areas inhabited by minority peoples, the accessibility of highways has also promoted material exchanges and enlivened the economic and cultural lives of minority peoples. The woolen fabrics, felt hats, snuff bottles, silks and satins, and women's silver ornaments favored by the Tibetan people are all supplied through these highways. The local specialties and animal products of these areas are also continuously transported out through the highways, greatly improving the material lives of the minority peoples. In the past, in many areas of Haixi and Hainan, local specialties were often abandoned and spoiled due to inconvenient transportation. Now, in areas where highways are accessible, this situation has been completely reversed.

Most of the highways in Qinghai are built on plateaus above 3,000 meters above sea level, and many Gobi deserts and mountains must be traversed. The road construction workers encountered many difficulties when building these highways.

### 开发柴达木盆地的资源　繁荣少数民族地区经济  青海省修筑公路七千多公里

    开发柴达木盆地的资源　繁荣少数民族地区经济
    青海省修筑公路七千多公里
    新华社西宁8日电　青海省在1956年里新建公路三千二百二十六公里，连同前三年修建的公路在内，全省新修公路共达七千零四十七公里，超额完成了第一个五年计划规定的全省筑路计划。
    公路的畅通，使从古来就是一些荒野的地区活跃起来了。去年在柴达木地区修建的几条公路，使这个盆地基本上形成了一个公路网。在这个盆地上，仅茶卡一地现在每昼夜经过的汽车就达三百车次，大批的勘探器材和物资从这里运入盆地。
    在很多少数民族人民居住的牧业地区，由于公路通达也促进了物资交流，活跃了少数民族人民的经济文化生活。藏民们喜爱的氆氇、呢帽、鼻烟盒、绸缎和妇女们的银饰，都经过这些公路得到供应。这些地区的土特产品、畜产品也不断经过公路运出来，大大改善了少数民族人民的物质生活。过去在海西、海南许多地区的土特产品，因为交通不便常被弃置变坏，现在在公路通达的地区，这种情况已经全部改变过来。
    青海境内公路大都修筑在海拔三千公尺以上的高原上，当中要经过不少戈壁和大山，筑路职工修建这些公路的时候，曾经遇到了许多困难。
