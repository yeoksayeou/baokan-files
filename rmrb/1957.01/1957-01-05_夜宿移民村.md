    Overnight Stay in an Immigrant Village
    By Our Correspondent Hu Jibang
    Eve of Christmas
    On Christmas Eve, heavy snow fell in various parts of Hungary. The fields were a vast expanse of white. The leafless forests seemed to be draped in white gauze and goose down, and the evergreen fir trees were covered with layers of snow. Only the blue Danube River continued to ripple.
    Across the river is Slovakia, and the towns and villages on both banks are inhabited by a mix of Hungarian, Czech, German, and Austrian nationalities. The area I was visiting, the Tata coal city, is more than fifty kilometers away from the riverbank. Tata coal city is the center of Komárom County, a famous coal region in northwestern Hungary.
    On the evening of December 24th, I stayed in a village five or six kilometers from Tata coal city, called Pusztai. Before liberation, it was inhabited by Germans. After liberation, some people followed the Hitler army and fled. Some of those who remained went to work in nearby factories after the land reform, some became small merchants and handicraft workers, and some became doctors and teachers. Between 1945 and 1947, Slovak chauvinists often discriminated against Hungarians living there, especially communists. At that time, dozens of underground party members' families moved from across the Danube River to live in this village. The Szabó-Kis family also moved to Pusztai with their relatives. The local party leader arranged for us to stay in the home of this reliable old communist. Szabó's eldest daughter, Irén, and youngest daughter, Hódi, knowing the purpose of my visit, accompanied me to visit some of their relatives and friends.
    A Village That Defeated the Enemy
    I first went to the home of the village secretary. The village secretary was transferred from the state at the time of the incident. He is a young man in his twenties. His wife was decorating the Christmas tree with their two children. He himself introduced me to the situation in the village. The village is inhabited by some Germans, whose lives are still richer than those of ordinary Hungarians. Class, national, and religious contradictions exist in this small village.
    Since 1948, twenty-eight immigrant households have established an agricultural production cooperative on the land of these German expatriate landlords. This cooperative was one of the first three cooperatives established in the country at that time, called the Red Flag Brigade Production Cooperative. During this counter-revolutionary restoration movement, this pioneer cooperative, as a banner of socialist agriculture, would naturally arouse special hatred from class enemies. However, in these difficult days, it was not only not crushed, but also overfulfilled this year's autumn harvest and autumn planting plan. What is the reason for this? First, it was because the Communist Party members in the village quickly organized self-defense, and second, it was also because the military and civilians cooperated well.
    There is a barracks near the village. On October 27th, three trucks drove from Budapest carrying some young people and fascist bandits. When they arrived here, they attacked the barracks, attempting to seize the weapons in the barracks to arm the Germans in the village. However, this garrison was very firm and did not compromise with the rioters. As a result, they were repelled and the Communist Party members in the village were armed. Later, the reactionaries in the village also attempted to disarm the Communist Party members several times, but they failed due to the unity of the Communist Party members. In this way, this politically complex village suffered neither casualties nor production losses.
    Thoughts of Rural Cadres
    As the village secretary's conversation was coming to an end, his wife brought over specially made festival pastries and wine. At this time, a group of relatives came to his house, they had heard we were here and came specially to invite us.
    We then went to visit the home of the village secretary's father. The people in his home hurriedly brought out wine and head cheese, repeatedly urging us to eat. We sat around a table, and the topic quickly turned to politics. When they talked about the nature of this incident, opinions diverged. The young secretary said: "The events of October 23rd were revolutionary in the initial stage, and only later turned into counter-revolution. Therefore, some achievements have now been obtained, such as the establishment of workers' committees, the increase in wages, the abolition of the purchase system, and the abolition of the quota system. Students have a revolutionary tradition, and these achievements were obtained due to the advocacy of the students."
    His uncle, an old Communist Party member and also a breeder at the farm, interrupted him before he finished speaking and asked him: "We are all farmers, so who are you revolutionizing against? I don't think the behavior of our university students in this incident is worth being proud of! As for whether those things you mentioned can be regarded as achievements is still worth studying. Can't they be achieved by peaceful means?"
    Irén also disagreed with the young secretary's views, saying: "Due to this incident, the national economy has suffered so much loss."
    The old uncle retorted: "Is it enough to abolish the purchase system? How can the country spend and build without the support of the peasants? Won't it still be necessary to use other methods to replace it in the future? What kind of revolution is this! I think the incident itself was a planned counter-revolution from the beginning."
    The young secretary asked the old man: "Have you carefully read the resolutions of the Party Central Committee? It doesn't deny these achievements."
    The old man explained: "The nature of the entire incident is counter-revolutionary, but it doesn't mean that every participant is a counter-revolutionary."
    Irén also asked: "Where did you see that the revolution is divided into two stages?"
    The young secretary teased her and said: "I saw it in the resolution."
    Irén said: "Why didn't I see it?"
    The secretary said: "Then read it again."
    At this time, Irén also became a little unconfident,
    "I'll reserve my opinion for now and talk about it after reading the resolution."
    The old man said: "Resolution or no resolution, the fact is that it is counter-revolutionary."
    Regarding the idea of dividing the Hungarian incident into two stages, many intellectuals now agree with it. This young secretary had studied a four-year correspondence course at the Marx Economic University, where Nagy Imre taught, and has been somewhat influenced by the intellectual circles of Budapest. His class viewpoint is blurred, which is a serious problem existing among intellectuals in Hungary today.
    Christmas Night
    The argument seemed to have reached a stalemate. Everyone still had questions in their hearts: the young man thought that the old breeder lacked theoretical knowledge and that these simple assertions were not convincing. The old man thought that the young man lacked combat experience and that things learned from books could not solve practical problems. They couldn't find any other topics to talk about, and the silent atmosphere made the host feel uneasy. At this time, someone knocked on the window, and then five young people walked in. Two girls dressed like angels, carrying a small shack the size of a birdcage, with a chemically-made nude little boy lying inside, with a picture of the Virgin Mary attached. Three young men: one was Santa Claus with a cane, and the other two were shepherds. They came to announce: "Jesus is born." The shepherds said some auspicious words, and finally the five sang a congratulatory hymn. The host rewarded the young people with some sweets and money, and then they went to another house.
    The hosts specially explained to me that they themselves are all Communist Party members and do not believe in these things, but they only let them in to perform because of me. I thanked the hosts for their kindness. The hostess said that they have a fir tree festival for the children every year. At this time, she had approached a beautifully decorated fir tree and lit the candles, turned off the electric lights, and the fireworks hanging on the branches immediately released colorful sparks. The children clapped and laughed. The grandmother quietly placed several boxes of gifts under the fir tree, then the fire went out, the electric lights came on again, and the children were overjoyed to find the gifts that Santa Claus had sent them.
    I bid farewell to this hospitable Hungarian family. There were no street lights outside, and I walked through a small alley by the light of the snow. At the end of the village, I saw a church, where the priests were already preparing for midnight mass. Many of the residents of Hungary are Catholics. After liberation, until 1948, religious lessons were listed as compulsory courses in schools. Last year, in order to take care of the people's traditional customs, the government gave two days off for Christmas, totaling three days with Sunday, and announced that the December 25th newspaper would publish a thirty-two-page Christmas special issue. On the 24th and 25th, the curfew was temporarily lifted; free passage was allowed all night. Residents could go to church to pray at midnight. However, the Pope in the Vatican issued an appeal to Catholics all over the world before Christmas, asking believers to insist on opposing socialism, saying that communists are devils and believers cannot stand with devils.
    As soon as Irén and Hódi saw a dark shadow appear in front, they pulled us to the side, and this vigilant action aroused a tense mood.
    In the Home of a Former Military Officer
    After Irén obtained the host's consent in advance, she brought us into a German family. Irén told me that this family had been taking a wait-and-see attitude during this incident, deciding which side to lean on depending on which side, the communists or the counter-revolutionaries, was stronger. The male head of this family used to be an officer in the Horthy army and is now a craftsman. He was sitting barefoot on the sofa smoking. When he saw us go in, he didn't intend to put on his shoes. He stood barefoot on the floor to greet us. His wife was a tall, middle-aged German woman, with a floral headscarf wrapped around her head and rosy cheeks. She was wearing a skirt. She put down the few playing cards in her hand and pointed to the girl opposite and said, this is her daughter, and those are her daughter's girlfriends, they are going to play cards until midnight. I asked: "Are you all going to church later?" "Yes, we are all Catholics." Even their two teenage boys answered in this way. I asked: "Why aren't the girls dancing on such a festive day?" The girls immediately became lively. They all said: "We like to dance very much, but there is no dance tonight, the soldiers have work." The mother explained: "There are very few young people in the village, so the girls often go to the barracks to find soldiers to dance with, and they can get married if they like each other." The girls said: "This year is much more deserted than in previous years, look, even drunkards don't dare to yell on the streets!"
    The mother took out a pack of old photos from a golden box for us to see. There were photos of herself in her youth, photos of her and her husband in Horthy military officer uniforms, and photos of her daughter at various ages after her birth. Now her daughter is nineteen years old, with a rosy apple face, two golden braids hanging over her shoulders, and a bright green sweater, which makes her look particularly charming.
    I did not ask them any political questions to avoid causing them emotional unease. They were already very patient and polite in receiving us like this. (Tata Coal City, 1st)

    夜宿移民村
    本报记者　胡济邦
    圣诞节的前夕
    圣诞节前夕，匈牙利各地降了大雪，田野里白茫茫一片，落叶的丛林像披上白纱和鹅绒，常青的枞树上压着层层的积雪。唯有这条蓝色的多瑙河依然泛着涟漪。
    河的对面就是斯洛伐克，两岸的城乡混居着匈、捷、德、奥的民族。我去访问的地区——塔塔煤城，离河边还有五十多公里。塔塔煤城是科马洛姆州的中心，匈牙利西北部的一个著名煤区。
    12月24日的晚上，我寄宿在距塔塔煤城五、六公里的一个村庄，名叫坡依村，解放前是德国人居住的村子。解放后有些人跟着希特勒军队跑了，留下的一部分人在土改后有的转到附近工厂做工，有的当小商贩和手工业者，也有的当医生和教员。在1945—1947年间，斯洛伐克的沙文主义者经常排挤侨居那边的匈牙利人，特别反对共产党人。那时曾有几十个地下党员的家庭从多瑙河的彼岸搬到这个村庄来住。沙布·吉绍一家也随着自己的亲戚们一同搬到坡依村来了。当地党的负责人把我们安置在这个可靠的老共产党员的家里。沙布的大女儿依玲和小女儿霍娄知道我的来意，就陪同我到她们的一些亲友家去串门。
    一个战胜敌人的村庄
    我先到乡书记的家。乡书记是事件发生时从州里调来的。他是一位二十几岁的青年。他的妻子正在和两个孩子装饰着圣诞树。他自己给我介绍这个村的情况。这个村子住着一些德国人，他们的生活依然比一般匈牙利人富裕。这个小小的村庄存在着阶级的、民族的和宗教信仰的矛盾。
    从1948年起，二十八户移民就在这些德国侨民地主的土地上建立起农业生产合作社，这个合作社是当时全国最早成立的三个合作社中的一个，名叫红旗大队生产合作社。在这次反革命的复辟运动中，这个作为社会主义农业旗帜的合作社的先锋，当然会引起阶级敌人特殊的憎恨。但是在这些困难的日子里，它不仅没有被搞垮，反而超额完成了今年秋收秋耕的计划。这是什么道理呢？首先是因为全村共产党员很快地组织起自卫，其次也因为军民很好地实行合作。
    村子附近有一个兵营，10月27日从布达佩斯开来三辆卡车载着一些青年和法西斯匪徒，他们到了这里就向兵营进攻，企图夺取兵营的武器来武装村里的德国人，但这支驻军很坚定，没有和暴徒妥协，结果把他们打退了，而且武装了这个村的共产党员。以后村里的反动分子也几次企图解除共产党人的武装，但由于共产党人的团结一致而未得逞。就这样，这个政治复杂的村庄既未遭到居民的伤亡，也没有受到生产上的损失。
    农村干部的思想
    当乡书记谈话快要结束的时候，他的妻子拿来了过节特制的点心和葡萄酒。这时他家又来了一批亲属，他们是听到我们在这里而特地过来邀请我们的。
    我们又去访问乡书记的父亲的家。他家里的人赶忙拿出酒和猪头肉做成的仪糕来，三番五次地让我们吃。我们围着一张桌子坐下了，大家的话题很快就转到政治方面。他们谈到这次事件的性质的时候，意见就发生了分歧。这位青年书记说：“10月23日的事件开始阶段是革命，到后来才变成反革命了。因此现在已经得到了一些成果，如工人委员会的建立，工资的提高，征购制的取消，定额制的取消。学生有革命的传统，这些成绩是由于学生倡导而获得的。”
    他的姨父，是一位老共产党员，也是本农庄的饲养员，没有等他说完就反问他：“咱们都是农民阶级，你说革命，是革谁的命？我不认为我们的大学生在这次事件中的行为值得骄傲！至于你说的那些东西是否能算作成绩还值得研究，难道用和平的方法不能做到吗？”
    依玲也不同意这位青年书记的看法，她说：“由于这次事件使全国经济遭受了多大的损失。”
    老姨父又反问说：“取消征购制就行了吗？国家没有农民的支持怎样开支？怎样建设？将来还不是需要用别的办法来代替，这算什么革命！我认为事件本身从开始就是有计划的反革命。”
    这位青年书记问老头说：“你是否很好地看过党中央的决议，里面没有否认这些成果。”
    老头解释说：“整个事件的性质是反革命，但并不等于每个参加者都是反革命分子。”
    依玲也问道：“革命分为二个阶段是从哪里看到的？”
    青年书记捉弄她说：“从决议里看到的。”
    依玲说：“我为什么没有看到？”
    书记说：“那你再看一遍吧。”
    这时依玲也有点不自信起来，
    “我暂时保留我的意见，看完决议后再谈。”
    老头说：“决议也好，不是决议也好，事实就是反革命。”
    关于匈牙利事件分为两个阶段的提法，现在有不少知识分子赞成。这位年轻的书记曾在纳吉执教过的马克思经济大学读过四年的函授课，已多少受到布达佩斯知识界的影响，阶级观点模糊，是今天在匈牙利知识分子中存在着的一个严重问题。
    圣诞节之夜
    争论似乎成了僵局，各人心中都还存在着问题：青年认为老饲养员缺乏理论知识，这些简单的论断不能令人信服。老头则认为青年缺乏斗争经验，书本上学来的东西不能解决实际问题。彼此都找不出别的话题，沉默的空气使主人感到不安。这时外面有人扣玻璃窗，随后走进了五个青年人。两个姑娘打扮得像天使一样，抬着一个鸽子笼大小的茅屋，里面躺着一个化学制的裸体小男孩，贴着一张圣母图。三个青年：一个是拿着手杖的圣诞老人，另外二个是牧羊人。他们跑来报讯：“耶稣降生了。”牧羊人说了一些吉利话，最后五人合唱祝贺的圣诗。主人赏给青年人一些糖果和钱，随后他们又到别家去了。
    主人们特别向我说明他们自己都是共产党员，并不相信这些，只是因为我的缘故才让他们进来表演的。我感谢主人的好意。女主人说他们每年都要给孩子们过枞树节。这时她已走近一棵装璜美丽的枞树旁边燃起蜡烛，把电灯关了，树枝上挂的焰火点着后立即放出五彩绚烂的火花。孩子们拍手欢笑。祖母悄悄地把几盒礼物放在枞树下，随后火光熄了，电灯又亮了，孩子们发现圣诞老人给自己送来的礼物高兴极了。
    我向这个好客的匈牙利人的家庭告辞了。外面没有路灯，靠着雪光走完一条小巷。看到村的尽头有一座教堂，神父们已在里面准备午夜的弥撒。匈牙利的居民有许多是天主教徒。解放后直到1948年，宗教课曾列为学校的必修课程。去年政府为了照顾人民的传统习惯，圣诞节放假二天，连星期日共为三天，并预告25日的报纸要出三十二版的圣诞节专号。24日、25日暂时撤销戒严令；准许通夜自由通行。午夜居民可进教堂祈祷。可是梵蒂冈的教皇在圣诞节前向全世界的天主教徒发出呼吁，要求信徒们坚持反对社会主义，说共产党人是魔鬼，信徒们不可以和魔鬼站在一起。
    依玲和霍娄一看到前面有黝黑的影子出现，就拉着我们往旁边走，这种警惕的行动倒引起了一种紧张的情绪。
    在一个旧军官的家庭
    依玲在事先征求主人的同意后，把我们带进了一个德国人的家庭。依玲告诉我，这个家庭在这次事件中一直抱着观望和等待的态度，看共产党和反革命的力量哪边强，就决定向哪边靠。这个家庭的男主人过去在霍尔蒂军队里当过军官，现在是手艺工人。他光着脚坐在沙发上抽烟，看到我们进去也没有打算穿上鞋子，就光着脚站在地板上迎接我们。他的妻子是一个身材高大的中年德国妇人，头上包着花头巾，两颊透红。身上围着一条裙子。她放下手上的几张纸牌，指着对面那位姑娘说，这是她的女儿，那是女儿的女朋友们，她们要玩纸牌到午夜。我问：“你们回头都到教堂去吗？”“都去，我们都是天主教徒呀。”连他们的两个十多岁的男孩儿也这样回答。我问：“在这样的节日里，姑娘们为什么不跳舞呢？”女孩们马上活跃起来，她们一齐说：“我们很喜欢跳舞，可是今晚没有舞会，士兵们有工作。”母亲解释说：“村子里青年很少，姑娘们经常到兵营去找士兵们跳舞，彼此看中了就可以结婚。”姑娘们说：“今年比往年冷清多了，你看，连醉汉都不敢到街上来叫嚷！”
    这位母亲从一个金色盒子里拿出一包旧照片给我们看。有她自己年轻时代的像片、和她的穿着霍尔蒂军官制服的丈夫合照的像片，以及她女儿出生后各种年龄的照片。现在她的女儿已经十九岁了，白里透红的苹果脸，肩上挂着两条金黄色的发辫，穿着一件翠绿色的毛衣显得特别娇艳。
    我没有向他们提出有关政治性的问题，以免引起他们情绪的不安。他们这样接待已经很有耐心和礼貌了。　（1日于塔塔煤城）
