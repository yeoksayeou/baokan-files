    Western Zhou Bronze Bell with Oblique Angle Thunder Pattern
    The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture's Cultural Relics Storage recently discovered a batch of bronze artifacts from the Western Zhou, Warring States, Western Han, and Tang and Song dynasties, among which the more important ones are the Western Zhou bronze bell with oblique angle thunder pattern and the Western Han Ganlu Second Year-made Right Chancellor's bronze ding.
    The Western Zhou oblique angle thunder pattern bell discovered this time has a vivid shape and fine texture, and is an important material for studying the history of Chinese national musical instruments. There are thirty-four characters inscribed on the front of the bell. From the inscription, it can be seen that this bell was made by a person named "Xi Zhong" in the last year of the Western Zhou Dynasty. The Right Chancellor's bronze ding made in the Western Han Dynasty is also of important reference value for studying the system of weights and measures and the official system of the Western Han Dynasty.

    西周的斜角雷纹钟
    上海市文化局所属文物整理仓库最近发现了一批西周、战国、西汉和唐宋等代的铜器，其中比较重要的有西周的斜角雷纹钟和西汉甘露二年造的右丞官铜鼎。
    这次发现的西周斜角雷纹钟造形生动，纹理精细，是研究我国民族器乐史的重要资料。在钟的正面刻有铭文三十四字。从铭文可以看出这个钟是西周末一年名叫“兮仲”的人制作的。西汉造的右丞官铜鼎对研究西汉的度量衡制度和官制也有重要的参考价值。　（张华鑫）
