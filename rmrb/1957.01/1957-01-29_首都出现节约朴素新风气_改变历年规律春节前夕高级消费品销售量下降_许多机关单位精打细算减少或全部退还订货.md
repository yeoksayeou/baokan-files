Xinhua News Agency, January 28th, by Xinhua News Agency reporter Lu Gongmin: Despite the approaching Spring Festival, a new atmosphere of thrift and simplicity has emerged in the capital market. Sales of almost all high-end consumer goods and office supplies have decreased. Many popular goods that were in short supply a month ago are now selling slowly. According to people familiar with the Beijing market, this is a rare and good phenomenon in recent years. On the third floor of the Department Store, which specializes in high-end consumer goods, thousands of customers were received every day a month ago. Now, by 8:00 PM, although there is still an hour and a half before closing time, there are very few customers buying things. The person in charge of this floor told reporters that they did not expect the campaign to increase production and practice economy to have such a big impact on commodity sales. As of the 22nd, the sales volume only accounted for more than 50% of the January sales plan, equivalent to 73% of the same period last December. Among them, watches, special arts and crafts, cameras, photographic equipment, woolen men's and women's clothing, Chinese and Western musical instruments, and other commodities only accounted for about 25% to 40% of the monthly sales plan. He said interestingly that in the past, many old customers of government departments had very large appetites, buying goods worth tens of thousands of yuan at a time, but now the situation is no longer the same. In the wholesale stations and affiliated retail stores of the Municipal Textile Products Company, the phenomenon of government departments, enterprises, and schools purchasing large quantities of curtains and sofa covers has also decreased significantly. Woolen fabrics and cotton cloth, which had broken the sales plan every month, achieved a balanced completion of the plan for the first time in January.

In the fourth quarter of last year, many units blindly purchased a large number of furniture. Every woodworking store was filled with cadres queuing up all day long. Not only did they buy all the available goods, but more than 400 units registered to pre-order 34 million yuan worth of furniture, which is almost equivalent to the two-year production task of all woodworking factories in the city. But now the situation has completely changed. Recently, in several woodworking stores, besides seeing a few housewives buying small wooden beds for their newborns, the reporter did not encounter a single purchasing agent from any government department. In the past, the United Cooperative of Woodworking Production Cooperatives could sell furniture worth at least 5,000 yuan a day, but now it cannot even sell 800 yuan. According to statistics from the Beijing Municipal Timber Industry Company, most of the units that originally registered to pre-order furniture have reduced or completely canceled their orders. Dozens of units, including the University of Foreign Trade, the Institute of Archaeology, and the Ministry of Chemical Industry, in the spirit of thrift, and after careful calculation, canceled all the registered pre-orders and signed contracts.

From the perspective of stationery, paper, scientific instruments, sporting goods, Chinese and Western musical instruments, mimeograph machines, typewriters, and cameras, the decline in commodity sales is even more obvious. This is because all government departments, schools, enterprises, and troops are paying attention to thrift and making every effort to use the remaining items from last year; some have lowered the standards for office expenses, so sales have generally declined. Those scientific instruments, typewriters, computers and other commodities that were often out of stock in the past and had to be allocated for sale have now also changed. A store in Dongdan District sold a total of 153 typewriters in the first and middle ten days of last December, but this month it has only sold three so far.

Paper, which has been in short supply for a long time, has also begun to decline in sales in the past two months. It is estimated that January sales will be 16,000 reams less than last December. The Medical Department of the Health Department of the Beijing Military Region used to need 2,000 reams of paper per quarter, but now it can save 600 reams of paper per quarter by using old forms and reports. The Ministry of Commerce and its affiliated professional companies have merged nine internal publications into one according to actual needs, which can save 10,000 reams of paper a year. According to statistics from more than 80 units, they have saved more than 4,000 reams of various types of paper in less than two months.

    首都出现节约朴素新风气
    改变历年规律春节前夕高级消费品销售量下降
    许多机关单位精打细算减少或全部退还订货
    新华社28日讯　新华社记者卢恭敏报道：尽管快到春节，首都市场却出现了节约朴素的新风尚，几乎所有的高级消费品和办公用品销售量都下降，许多在一个月前供不应求的畅销货，现在也销售得很慢。据熟悉北京市场的人说，这是历年来少有的好现象。在百货大楼专售高级消费品的三楼上，一个月前，每天都接待成千上万的顾客，现在，一到晚上八点钟，虽然离停止营业时间还有一个半小时，就很少有顾客买东西了。这层楼的业务负责人告诉记者，他们没有想到增产节约运动对商品销售的影响这样大。到22日止，售出的商品只占1月份的销货计划50％多，相当于去年12月同期的73％。其中钟表、特种工艺品、照像机、照像器材、呢绒男女服装、中西乐器等商品，只占月销售计划25％到40％左右。他有趣地说，过去许多机关的老主顾，胃口非常大，一买就是成千上万元的商品，现在的情况已经不是这样了。在市纺织品公司的批发站和所属的门市部里，机关、企业和学校大量购置窗帘、沙发套的现象也显著地减少了，曾经月月突破销售计划的呢绒和棉布，1月份第一次出现了均衡完成计划的情况。
    去年第四季度，许多单位曾经盲目地大量购买家具，每个木器门市部终日都有许多干部排队，他们不但把现货买光了，还有四百多个单位登记要预购三千四百万元的家具，这差不多等于全市所有木器厂两年的生产任务。而现在的情况完全变化了，最近记者在几个木器门市部里，除了看见几个家庭主妇在为出生不久的婴儿选购小木床以外，没有碰到一个机关的采购人员。木器生产合作社联合社门市部过去一天最少要卖出价值五千多元的家具，现在还卖不到八百元。据北京市木材工业公司统计，原来登记预购家具的单位，绝大部分都减少或全部退了订货。对外贸易学院、考古研究所、化学工业部等几十个单位，本着节约精神，经过精打细算，把已登记预购和签订的合同全部撤销了。
    从文具、纸张、科学仪器、体育用品、中西乐器、油印机、打字机、照像机等行业看，商品销售额下降得更为明显。这是由于各机关、学校、企业和部队都注意节约，尽量利用去年的剩余物品；有的降低了办公用费的标准，因此销货额普遍下降。那些过去经常脱销不得不分配出售的科学仪器、打字机、计算机等商品，现在情况也变了。东单区一个商店，去年12月上、中两旬共销售一百五十三台打字机，这个月到现在才卖了三台。
    很久以来都是供应不足的纸张，在最近两个月中的销货额也开始下降。预计1月份将比去年12月少销一万六千令纸张。北京军区卫生部医疗处过去一个季度需用二千令纸，现在利用旧表报，每个季度能节省六百令纸。商业部和所属的专业公司根据实际需要，把九种内部刊物合并成一种，这样一年就能节省一万令纸。据八十多个单位的统计，最近在不到两个月的时间内，他们节约的各种纸张在四千令以上。
