    Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 27th: The Fushun Mining Bureau, based on the State Council's instructions, has decided to increase coal production by more than 96,000 tons in the first quarter to alleviate the current tight coal supply situation nationwide.

    After the State Council's instructions were conveyed to the Fushun mining area, the workers were very enthusiastic. Some canceled their train tickets and decided not to go home during the Spring Festival, staying at the mine to continue production. Leading cadres of the Laohutai Mine will take turns being on duty and going down the mine during the Spring Festival to guide machine repairs and prepare for production.

    During the Spring Festival, the Fushun Coal Mine will increase maintenance personnel to ensure that urgently needed mechanical and electrical equipment is repaired well and quickly. In this way, the entire mine can produce more than 10,000 tons of raw coal during the Spring Festival and create conditions for a large increase in coal production in February and March. The Longfeng Mine Coal Washing Plant will shorten the Spring Festival maintenance time, which can produce about 2,500 tons more of coking coal for Angang. Currently, the Fushun Mining Bureau's affiliated machine repair plant, gunpowder factory, transportation department, and other units are making tense preparations for increasing coal production.

    Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, 27th: More than 4,000 workers and cadres in the open-pit mining area, coal washing plant, and coal storage yard of the Xinqiu Coal Mine in Fuxin will all be on duty as usual during the Spring Festival holiday, producing more than 12,000 tons of coal.

    Some workers at the Xinqiu Mine had already bought train tickets to go home; however, when they heard the State Council's call for coal mine workers to over-fulfill coal mining quotas during the Spring Festival and that some cities and factories were urgently awaiting coal, they abandoned their original plans. Now, the workers have expressed to the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations their desire to continue production as usual during the Spring Festival holiday.

    热烈响应加紧煤炭生产的号召
    抚顺矿决定在第一季度增产煤九万六千吨
    新丘煤矿职工将在春节假期全部照常出勤
    新华社抚顺27日电　抚顺矿务局根据国务院指示，决定在第一季度增产九万六千多吨煤，来缓和目前全国煤炭供应紧张的情况。
    国务院指示传到抚顺矿区以后，职工们热情很高，有人退了火车票，决定春节期间不回家，留在矿上坚持生产。老虎台矿领导干部将在春节期间轮流值班下井，指导机器检修和做好生产准备工作。
    春节期间，抚顺煤矿将增加检修人员，使急需检修的机电设备检修得又好、又快。这样，春节期间全矿就可以多生产一万多吨原煤，并且为二、三月份大量增产煤炭创造条件。龙凤矿选煤厂缩短春节检修时间，就可以多精选出两千五百吨左右炼焦煤，供应鞍钢。现在，抚顺矿务局所属的机修厂、火药厂、运输部等单位，正在紧张地为增产煤炭进行准备。
    据新华社阜新27日电　阜新新丘煤矿露天矿区、选煤厂和储煤场有四千多工人和干部，将在春节假期全部照常出勤，生产一万二千多吨煤。
    新丘矿有些工人已经买好了回家的车票；可是当他们听到国务院号召煤矿工人春节超额采煤和有些城市和工厂急等着煤用的时候，便放弃了原来的打算。现在工人们都向党、工会、青年团组织表示，要求在春节假期照常生产。
