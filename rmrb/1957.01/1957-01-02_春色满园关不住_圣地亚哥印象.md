Spring Cannot Be Confined Within the Garden Walls
Impressions of Santiago
An Interview with Wang Li, Deputy Head of the South American Chinese Art Troupe

Our journey from China to Chile was the longest possible journey on Earth between two countries. Although this place is called "the edge of the Earth," the hospitable Chileans made us feel as if we were living in our own home.

As soon as we arrived at Santiago Airport, Mr. Allende, the famous Chilean political leader who had visited our country, had Chief Delegate Chu Tunan and me ride in his own car and took us to the hotel.

Mr. Allende is a politician of medium stature, with a short beard, and a typical South American personality. He is the leader of the Chilean Socialist Party, Chairman of the People's Action Front, a Senator, former President of the Senate, and was the opponent who ran against the current president in the last election. The Chilean Socialist Party he leads advocates cooperation with the Chilean Communist Party and friendship with the Soviet Union and China; he serves as the chairman of the Chile-China Cultural Association. He and his wife have visited China.

Mr. Allende told us that the people of Santiago had summoned spring in advance to welcome guests from afar.

August should be the late winter and rainy season in Santiago, but bright spring sunshine appeared. Cherry blossoms had already withered, peach blossoms were budding, willow branches were sprouting green buds, lilacs and chrysanthemums were in full bloom, and golden oranges were growing on the orange trees.

The scene of "spring cannot be confined within the garden walls" perfectly symbolizes the mood of the Chilean people today.

This long and narrow country is famous for its rich deposits of copper and nitrate. In Santiago, one can see impressive and moving bronze statues everywhere, as well as copper utensils and copper handicrafts. However, the export of this precious metal is controlled by American companies; for the past three years, the price of copper has been suppressed to the level of dirt. Nitrate cannot be sold either, and nitrate miners have been on strike for three consecutive months; their strike actions express their dissatisfaction with the American monopoly of the Chilean economy.

On August 18, the Chilean people fully expressed their national sentiments.

This was the holiday commemorating O'Higgins, the national hero who founded the nation during the Chilean War of Independence. All Chilean newspapers published large photographs of O'Higgins on their front pages, recording his famous sayings: "Follow me to obtain the honor of life, or gloriously die in battle!" "With my arm, save my motherland!"

In front of the towering bronze statue of O'Higgins, clad in armor and riding a warhorse, crowds of people endlessly laid flowers.

On this day, according to the tradition of the city of Santiago, the two highest institutions of learning in the city—the University of Chile and the Catholic University—competed in soccer and held a costume parade. More than 50,000 Chileans gathered in a soccer field at the foot of the Andes Mountains, and many important civil and military officials of the country also attended this grand event. University students, dressed in national costumes, narrated the history of the Chilean War of Independence in living tableaux, praised famous national heroes and unsung heroes in poetic language, and performed various folk dances.

Of particular note was that the loudspeakers at the venue continuously broadcast satirical dialogues and poems that fiercely criticized the American monopoly capital for strangling the Chilean economy with the most pungent language. The entire audience responded to this broadcast with continuous and enthusiastic applause.

Amid thunderous applause, representatives of the Chinese Art Troupe were invited to the center of the field and received flower baskets presented by the two universities.

The Chinese Art Troupe also received courteous treatment from the Chilean government in Santiago. Five minutes before the opening of our first performance, President Ibáñez and his wife suddenly arrived at the theater. In a special hall, President Ibáñez, dressed in a general's uniform, received Chief Delegate Chu Tunan and me. The President said to us, "The Chilean people welcome you." This sentence, along with "They really brought good things" which he said at the end of the performance, was published in the Santiago newspapers the next day.

President Ibáñez is a non-partisan military man. In parliament, his government mainly relies on the support of the Radical Party and the Liberal Party.

Mr. Alexander, the leader of the Liberal Party, is the Speaker of the Senate, and he presented us with a silver-plated national emblem when he received the leaders of the Chinese Art Troupe.

Mr. Aran, the leader of the Radical Party, and representatives of parliamentarians from various parties accompanied the members of the Art Troupe to visit the halls of parliament. Mr. Aran expressed a strong interest in China.

In the halls of the Chilean Parliament, the seats of the Radical Party are in the middle, the Liberal Party is on the right, the Conservative Party is further to the right, the Traditional Conservative Party (Catholic Conservative Party) is on the far right, and the Socialist Party and some other small parties are on the left. They use the position of their seats to indicate their political attitudes.

All Chilean political parties and newspapers have been friendly towards the Chinese Art Troupe. Initially, only the Traditional Conservative Party was indifferent, and their "Knowledge-Rich Newspaper" even refused to publish advertisements.

Since Cardinal Caro, the ninety-one-year-old Archbishop, received the leaders of the Chinese Art Troupe, the attitude of the Traditional Conservative Party and the "Knowledge-Rich Newspaper" has also improved.

The leaders of these parties, in their conversations with the Chinese Art Troupe, were full of nationalistic sentiments, and even the Cardinal Archbishop was publicly considered to be increasingly showing an "enlightened tendency."

Santiago's largest newspaper, "El Mercurio," tallied the news coverage of various newspapers over half a month and found that there were four major news items. In order, they were: First, increasing employee salaries: In this news item, the newspaper criticized the United States for strangling the Chilean economy. Since the arrival of the American financial advisory group in Chile, prices and the cost of living have risen rapidly over the past three months, and the increase in employee salaries is insignificant compared to the sharp rise in prices.

Second, the great strike of nitrate workers.

Third, welcoming the Chinese Art Troupe: The newspapers unanimously praised Chinese art, believing that the scale of the welcome even exceeded that of all foreign official delegations.

Fourth, the government cabinet crisis: This was the twenty-fourth cabinet crisis since President Ibáñez took office. The result was that three more ministers were replaced. The newspaper humorously wrote: "Chileans care more about the Chinese Art Troupe than about the cabinet crisis."

Clearly, Chinese artists are filled with sympathy for this nationalistic sentiment of the Chilean people where "spring cannot be confined within the garden walls", and this is a situation of "spring scenery annoys and prevents sleep" for American monopolists. (Attached pictures)

    春色满园关不住
    圣地亚哥印象
    访南美中国艺术团副团长  王力
    我们这次从中国到智利的旅程，是地球上从一个国家到另外一个国家的最长的旅程。尽管这里被称为“地球的边缘”，但是好客的智利人使我们生活在如同自己的家里一样。
    一到圣地亚哥机场，曾经访问过我国的智利著名政治领袖阿伦德先生就让楚图南团长和我，坐上他自己驾驶的汽车，把我们送到旅馆。
    阿伦德先生是一个中等身材、蓄着短胡子、具有典型的南美洲人性格的政治家。他是智利社会党领袖，人民行动阵线主席，参议员，前参议院议长，是上次大选时和现任总统竞选的对手。他所领导的智利社会党是主张同智利共产党合作，主张同苏联和中国友好的；他担任着智中文化协会的主席。他和他的夫人一起访问过中国。
    阿伦德先生对我们说，圣地亚哥人提前唤来了春季来迎接远方的客人。
    8月，应该是圣地亚哥的残冬和雨季，却出现了明媚的春光。樱桃花已经雕谢，桃花正含苞待放，柳条正吐出青芽，丁香和菊花盛开，橘子树上正结着金黄的果实。
      “春色满园关不住”的情景，正好也象征着今天智利人民的心情。
    这个狭长土地的国家，以丰富的铜和硝石的蕴藏闻名于世。在圣地亚哥，人们可以看到，到处是精采动人的铜像，到处是铜质器皿，到处是铜制的手工艺品。但是这种宝贵的金属的出口，却被美国的公司所操纵；近三年来，铜的价格更被压低得如同粪土。硝石也销售不出去，硝矿工人已经连续罢工三个月；他们的罢工行动表示了对美国垄断智利经济的不满情绪。
    8月18日这一天，智利人民尽情地吐露了他们的民族情绪。
    这是纪念智利独立战争时代开国的民族英雄奥黑金斯的节日。全智利的报纸都在首页刊载着奥黑金斯的巨幅照片，铭录着他的名言：“跟着我取得生的荣誉，或者是光荣的战死！”“用我的臂膀，拯救我的祖国！”
    在高耸的身披盔甲、骑着战马的奥黑金斯铜像面前，人群络绎不绝地献上鲜花。
    这一天，依照圣地亚哥市的传统，由市内两个最高学府——智利大学和天主教大学比赛足球，同时举行化装表演。五万多智利人聚集在安第斯山脚下一个足球场上，这个国家的许多重要文武官员也都出席了这个盛会。大学生们穿着民族服装，用活报形式叙述了智利独立战争的历史，用诗的语言歌颂了著名的民族英雄和无名英雄，也表演了各种土风舞。
    特别引人注意的是，会场上的大喇叭一直广播着以最辛辣的语言、猛烈抨击美国垄断资本窒息智利经济的蛮横作法的对口白和讽刺诗。全场对这种广播不断报以热烈的掌声。
    在雷动的掌声中，中国艺术团的代表被请到场子中央，接受了两个大学赠送的花篮。
    中国艺术团在圣地亚哥也受到智利政府的礼貌待遇。在我们首次公演开幕前五分钟，伊巴涅斯总统夫妇突然来到剧院。在一个特别大厅里，身穿将军服的伊巴涅斯总统接见了楚图南团长和我。这位总统对我们说：“智利人民很欢迎你们。”这句话和他在演出结束时讲的“他们果然带来了很好的东西”一起被刊载在次日圣地亚哥的报纸上。
    伊巴涅斯总统是一个无党派的军人。在议会里，他的政府主要依靠激进党和自由党的支持。
    自由党领袖亚历山大先生是参议院议长，他在接见中国艺术团的领导人时，赠送了银质底盘的国徽给我们。
    激进党领袖阿兰先生和各党派的议员代表陪着艺术团团员参观了议会的大厅。阿兰先生表示了对中国的浓厚兴趣。
    在智利议会的大厅中，激进党席位在中间，右边是自由党，再右边是保守党，极右边是传统保守党（天主教保守党），左边是社会党和一些别的小党派。他们以席位的位置，来表明自己在政治态度上的倾向。
      智利的各政党和各报，对待中国艺术团的态度都是友好的。最初，只有传统保守党表现冷淡，在他们主办的“知识丰富报”上连广告也拒绝刊载。
    自从九十一岁的红衣大主教加罗尔博士接见了中国艺术团的领导人之后，传统保守党和“知识丰富报”的态度也有了好转。
    这些党派的领袖人物在和中国艺术团接触时的谈吐中，充满着民族主义的情绪，连红衣大主教也被公众认为日益增长着“开明倾向”。
      圣地亚哥一家最大的报纸“水星报”，统计了半个月来各报的新闻篇幅，共有四大新闻。顺序是：第一是增加职工工薪：在这条新闻里，报纸抨击美国扼杀了智利经济。自从美国财经顾问团到智利后，三个月来，物价和生活指数更加飞速上升，与物价的猛烈上升相比，职工工薪的增加是微不足道的。
    第二是硝石工人大罢工。
    第三是欢迎中国艺术团：各报一致称赞中国的艺术，认为欢迎的盛况甚至超过了所有的外国的官方代表团。
    第四是政府内阁危机：这是伊巴涅斯总统就任以来的第二十四次内阁危机。结果是又换了三位部长。这家报纸幽默地写道：“智利人关心中国艺术团超过了关心内阁危机。”
    显然的，中国艺术家对于智利人民的这种“春色满园关不住”的民族主义感情，是充满着同情的，而这对于美国的垄断资本家来说未免是“春色恼人眠不得”了。（附图片）
