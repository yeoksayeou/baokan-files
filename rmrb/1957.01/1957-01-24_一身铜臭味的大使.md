	Ambassador Reeking of Money
	According to the January 7th issue of the American magazine "Time": The new American ambassador to England, John Hay Whitney, was originally the boss of New York's Whitney Investment Company. His grandfather, old Whitney, was a major capitalist in the American railway industry, and left him an inheritance worth 60 million US dollars after his death. His maternal grandfather was the notorious John Hay, the American Secretary of State who drafted the "Open Door" policy in the early 20th century. When he was a student, his family had 28 cars, but every time he took his classmates to school, he charged each of them five cents, just like taking a public bus. In 1952, he began to spend money to help Eisenhower campaign. After Eisenhower was elected, he served on various committees in the US government until he was recently appointed as the US ambassador to England.

    一身铜臭味的大使
    据1月7日的美国“时代”杂志载：新任美国驻英大使约翰·海·惠特尼原是纽约惠特尼投资公司的老板。他的祖父老惠特尼是美国铁路界大资本家，死后给他留下了价值六千万美元的遗产。他的外祖父是臭名远扬的“门户开放”政策的草拟人二十世纪初美国国务卿约翰·海。他当学生的时候家里有二十八部小汽车，但他每次带同学坐汽车一块儿上学却照公共汽车的办法向每个同学收费五分。1952年他开始出钱帮艾森豪威尔竞选。艾森豪威尔当选后他就在美国政府的各种委员会里充任委员，直到最近被任命为美国驻英大使。
