Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 13th: The Tianjin People's Committee, at its first plenary enlarged meeting held on the 12th, made twenty preliminary provisions on overcoming bureaucracy and practicing economy, and announced their immediate implementation.

Li Gengtao, Deputy Mayor of Tianjin, in explaining this proposal, first called on leading cadres at all levels to go deep into the grassroots. He announced that the joint office meeting of the Mayor and Deputy Mayors would be streamlined from once a week in the past to once every two weeks. Every Thursday is designated as a "no-meeting day for municipal-level organs," and leading cadres of each organ should make every effort to use this day to go to grassroots units to understand the work situation and help solve problems. At the same time, it is stipulated that cadres at or above the level of bureau director and deputy bureau director throughout the city must spend at least four days to a week each month going deep into the grassroots to work.

Among the twenty measures, it was also determined that the current three-level system or the de facto three-level system of municipal-level organs should be uniformly changed to a two-level system, and the streamlining of the establishment should start from the organs of the Municipal People's Committee, with a one-third reduction first.

Li Gengtao said that it is necessary to oppose the bad habits of official document travel, random publication of newspapers, and writing lengthy reports and instructions, and other forms of paperwork. He condemned the behavior of randomly printing and distributing publications and sending irrelevant documents to other organs. He said that according to the provisions of these twenty articles, each instruction and request for instructions from various organs should not exceed 1,500 words, and particularly needed materials can be written as attachments; reducing the paper expenses in the administrative expenses of various organs by one-third to one-half in the new year is one of the effective measures to oppose paperwork. Specific control measures have also been formulated for curbing the random publication of newspapers and saving office space and office supplies. Specific measures have also been formulated for strengthening collaboration and promoting democracy. These measures have been unanimously supported by everyone.

When these twenty preliminary regulations were adopted, Huang Huoqing, Mayor of Tianjin, called on the leading cadres of the municipal-level organs to make up their minds to ensure the implementation of these measures, and to influence the grassroots cadres with practical actions so that the various tasks would show a new atmosphere.

    天津市人民委员会
    作出具体规定克服官僚主义
    其中规定每星期四为市级机关无会议日　负责干部每月至少有四天到一周深入基层工作　市级机关三级制一律改为两级制
    据新华社天津13日电　天津市人民委员会在12日举行的第一次全体扩大会议上，对克服官僚主义和厉行节约问题作出了二十条初步规定，并且宣布立即执行。
    天津市副市长李耕涛在解释这项提案时，首先要求各级领导干部深入基层。他宣布市长和副市长的联合办公会议由过去的每周一次精简为每两周一次。每星期四规定为“市级各机关无会议日”，各机关的领导干部要尽量利用这一天到基层单位去了解工作情况，帮助解决问题。同时规定全市局长、副局长以上的干部每月至少要有四天到一周的时间，深入到基层去工作。
    在二十项措施中还确定把现在市级机关还是三级制或实际上是三级制的一律改为两级制，精简编制从市人民委员会机关开始，先精简三分之一。
    李耕涛说，必须反对公文旅行、乱发表报和写冗长的报告、指示等文牍主义恶习。他指责那些随便印发刊物和乱送不相干的文件给别的机关的行为。他说，在这二十条中所规定的各机关的指示和请示等文件，每一件不得超过一千五百个字，特别需要的材料可写成附件；在新的一年里各机关行政费中的纸张费减少三分之一到一半是反对文牍主义的有效措施之一。对制止乱发表报、节约办公用房和办公用具等，也作出了具体的控制办法。对加强协作、发扬民主等也作出了具体措施。这些措施都得到大家一致的拥护。
    在这二十条初步规定被通过的时候，天津市市长黄火青号召市级各机关的领导干部下定决心，来保证这些措施的实现，并且用实际行动去影响基层干部，使各项工作出现新的气象。
