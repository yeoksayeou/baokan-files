    The special train sped across the vast plains all night. When we woke up in the early morning, we had not yet crossed the border of Punjab. Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and Prime Minister Nehru were strolling on the platform of a small station on the way to Nangal station. A hazy mist shrouded the blue foothills of the distant Himalayas. Premier Zhou put on the navy blue woolen uniform he wore in Beijing at this time of year, and rubbed his hands from time to time.

    Prime Minister Nehru was not wearing the white "Gandhi cap," revealing his ample forehead and snow-white temples. They breathed in the fresh morning air and talked intimately about something.

    Last night, the telephones in the newsrooms of Delhi newspapers rang incessantly. British and American reporters who had come to cover the meeting between the Chinese and Indian prime ministers were already discussing it in the dining car early in the morning, eager to find out how long they had talked last night and when they had gone to bed. People were watching with great concern the meeting between Prime Minister Nehru, who had just returned from visits to the United States and Canada, and Premier Zhou Enlai.

    The special train continued to speed across the rich and beautiful land of Punjab. The winding Sutlej River sparkled in the glory of the morning sun. This is the famous "granary of India." The word Punjab is Sanskrit, meaning the land of five rivers. Five majestic rivers originating from the Himalayas flow through it – the Beas River, the Sutlej River, the Ravi River, the Chenab River, and the Jhelum River. Since ancient times, Punjab has been a land of abundance with developed agriculture. In 1858, Punjab was the heroic province that resisted the British invasion and persisted in the struggle until the very end. Since then, the colonists' plunder has caused frequent disasters in Punjab, and this "granary" has suffered from grain shortages year after year. In 1947, the colonists dismembered Punjab. Its western part was assigned to Pakistan, and its eastern part to India. Two of the five rivers were assigned to Pakistan. The issue of water allocation between the Ravi River and the Sutlej River, which flow through East and West Punjab, became an inextricable dispute between India and Pakistan.

    In India, due to the hot and dry climate, river water irrigation is very important for farmland. The hardworking and intelligent Indian people have been renowned for their expertise in water conservancy and irrigation for many centuries. However, this rich irrigation experience with a long tradition could only be used to serve the people after independence. In the state of Rajasthan, which borders Punjab, large areas of desert seem to be roasted by a furnace all year round. There, drought disasters occur due to lack of water, and hundreds of thousands of livestock died in herds from 1938 to 1940. In Punjab, however, the rivers flood during the rainy season, or the water is wasted. Water, called "Pani" in Hindi, is so sacred, precious, and terrible!

    It is not difficult to understand why irrigation, power, and agricultural investment occupy such an important position in India's Five-Year Plans (accounting for 43.2% of total investment in the First Five-Year Plan and 30.8% of total investment in the Second Five-Year Plan).

    The Bhakra-Nangal multipurpose project for water conservancy, power generation, and irrigation, located more than 200 miles northwest of Delhi, is one of the major construction projects in India's First Five-Year Plan. This magnificent project, with an investment of 1.7 billion rupees, will, when completed in 1960, build a large dam 680 feet high (roughly equivalent to the height of a 60-story building) in the mountains of Hoshiarpur District, blocking the turbulent Sutlej River. It will then channel the raging river water and torrential rainwater into the valleys, turning it into an artificial lake 80 kilometers long and 5 kilometers wide, thereby preventing disasters in vast areas of Punjab, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh, and delivering water to the parched farmland and vegetable gardens when needed. In addition, two large-scale hydroelectric power stations will be built there, with ten hydraulic turbines, capable of generating 90,000 kilowatts of electricity, supplying electricity to 130 cities and towns of all sizes and 5,000 villages.

    Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru rode in an open car through the Nangal Dam, which was adorned with Chinese and Indian flags and dressed in festive attire, amid the cheers of tens of thousands of people. Construction workers, families, children, and neighboring farmers followed the car in groups, chasing and cheering along the roadside. The huge dam was densely packed with people on both sides, and Punjabi women wearing brightly colored national costumes gathered together to form a magnificent picture.

    After passing the dam, the car drove along a steep and winding mountain road into a narrow valley. On the towering mountains and vertically cut stone walls, startling slogans were written: Dangerous Road! Drive Slowly! Drive Safely!

    The car spiraled up the mountain almost in a "Z" shape, and the guests arrived at the famous Bhakra construction site.

    Chief Engineer Khungar and other responsible engineers of the construction project distributed white steel helmets for head protection to the guests, and then explained to the guests next to an engineering model on the construction site.

    The Bhakra-Nangal project includes five major parts: 1. Bhakra Dam. 2. Nangal Dam. 3. Nangal Hydel Channel. 4. Nangal Power Station. 5. Bhakra Canal System.

      "This Bhakra gravity dam, which is the highest in the world to date, was started in 1948," the chief engineer said.

    The bald-headed old Indian engineer, who had been dealing with floods for two or thirty years, pointed and described the entire ambitious plan and construction process of the Bhakra-Nangal project. He said: The dreams of the Indian people in suffering for centuries have finally become a reality. He remembered that the necessity of this project had been talked about since 1908, when Punjab was still under British rule. Prime Minister Nehru interjected at this time and said: "This is the Bodhi temple I worship!"

    This is a flat area carved out of a rocky mountain. In front, between two giant peaks 1,700 feet wide, spanned the scaffolding for construction. Three cranes, as tall as giants, reaching 150 feet high, stretched their towering arms back and forth between the two mountains, 3,500 feet above sea level. Rows of large iron buckets (each bucket holds eight tons of concrete, which is loaded and transported by four automatic mixers, each loading less than two minutes) are as busy as ants, transporting 400 tons of concrete per hour. Nehru told Premier Zhou that he came here in November 1955 to preside over the groundbreaking ceremony for the dam foundation project. Since that day, the machines have been transporting concrete to the construction site day and night. Now, the cement used every day is worth 200,000 rupees. The entire project requires 140 million cubic feet of concrete, enough to build a highway from Calcutta to New York. The project requires such a large amount of cement, so it needs its own complete set of cement manufacturing equipment and automated machines for transporting cement. The chief engineer said that solving the cement supply is an important part of the construction project, and these automated equipment are designed by Indian engineers themselves. There is a six-mile-long conveyor belt here, transporting cement, sand, and small stones to the concrete automatic mixer day and night. Mixing concrete requires a lot of water, so a water company that supplies six million tons of water every day has also been built here.

    Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long went down to the construction site to watch the process of pouring the concrete foundation. Various machines roared, making deafening noises, and workers in blue work clothes and steel helmets were working nervously. Radios were used to direct the work on the construction site.

    Prime Minister Nehru then accompanied Premier Zhou and Vice Premier He Long across the iron frame spanning the valley. Looking down from the iron frame, the people on the riverbed construction site were just moving black dots. The future dam will be so high. Its upper end is 1,700 feet long, the lower end is 320 feet long, the top is 30 feet thick, and the bottom is 625 feet thick, in the shape of a trapezoid. The chief engineer told the Chinese guests that more than 8,000 workers are participating in the construction, including 250 engineers and technicians, and 25 American consultants.

      "We encountered many unexpected difficulties in the complex practice," the chief engineer said, "but we also gained valuable experience in high dam construction." He pointed to the two waterways on both sides of the dam and said, "We spent three years splitting the mountain and five years tunneling through two waterways, each 50 feet in diameter and half a mile long. This was to let the river water flow out of these two waterways so that the riverbed could be exposed for construction."

    The guests were led into a tunnel, which is prepared for the future installation of hydraulic turbines for power generation. There is another identical tunnel under the opposite cliff. Two hydroelectric power stations with ten hydraulic turbines will be built here in the future.

    On the corridor of the cliff, workers were operating wind drills to drill holes in the rock wall. It is said that this is a remedial measure taken after discovering that the rocks on both sides were not strong enough because the dam was too large. These holes will be filled with cement using air compressors.

    After visiting the various construction projects, Prime Minister Nehru invited Premier Zhou Enlai to climb to the top of the mountain at the highest point of the project to look out over the future artificial lake—the water stored in this lake can irrigate 10 million acres of land. The Sutlej River lies horizontally in the embrace of the mountains like a giant dragon winding. In the distance, there are scattered villages, probably no less than three or four hundred. In the past, this large area was the territory of the Bilaspur prince. After independence, the power of the prince was weakened. In order to build this dam and artificial lake, the residents of this area will be relocated to other places, and their land will be compensated by the government at the official price, including the prince. An Indian reporter said: This is called "Bhakra Lake flooded the feudal forces"!

    After visiting the construction project, the two prime ministers of China and India continued their talks in a delicate and quiet pavilion on the banks of the Sutlej River that afternoon. (Sent from New Delhi on January 1)

    周总理在巴克拉—南加尔水利工程工地上
    新华社记者　孔迈
    专车在辽阔的平原上奔驰了一个通宵。清早醒来，我们却还没有越出旁遮普的邦界，周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和尼赫鲁总理在到南加尔车站途中的一个小车站的月台上散步。迷蒙的薄雾笼罩着远处蓝色的喜马拉雅山麓。周总理穿上了在北京这个时候穿用的藏青呢制服，不时搓搓手。
    尼赫鲁总理没有戴白色的“甘地帽”，露出了丰硕的前额和雪白的两鬓。他俩一面呼吸着早晨清新的空气，一面亲切地在谈论着什么。
    昨晚，德里各报编辑部的电话铃一直朗朗不绝。追随中印两国总理而来采访的英美记者们一早起来就在餐车里议论纷纷，急于打听他俩昨晚谈了多久，什么时候睡的觉？……人们都以极大的关怀，注视着刚从美国、加拿大访问归来的尼赫鲁总理和周恩来总理的再次会见。
    专车继续在旁遮普富饶而美丽的土地上奔驰。蜿蜒的苏特里杰河的河水在朝阳的光辉照耀下闪闪发光。这儿是著名的“印度的谷仓”。旁遮普这个词是梵文，意思是五条河流的地方。它的境内奔流着发源于喜马拉雅山的五条雄伟的河流——比阿斯河、苏特里杰河、拉维河、契纳布河和杰隆河。自古以来旁遮普就是农业发达的鱼米之乡。1858年，旁遮普是抵抗英军侵略坚持斗争直到最后的一个英雄的省份。从此以后，殖民者的掠夺使旁遮普灾荒频仍，这个“谷仓”竟年年闹粮荒。1947年殖民者又肢解了旁遮普。它的西部被划归巴基斯坦，东部划归印度。五条河当中有两条划归巴基斯坦。流经东西旁遮普的拉维河和苏特里杰河的河水分配问题成了印巴之间纠缠不清的纠纷。
    在印度，由于气候炎热而干燥，河水灌溉对于农田有很重要的意义。勤劳智慧的印度人民许多世纪以前就已经以善长于水利灌溉驰名世界。可是这种具有悠久传统的丰富的灌溉经验，只有在独立以后，才有可能被利用来为人民服务。在和旁遮普毗邻的拉贾斯坦邦大片的沙漠好像火炉一样终年烧烤着。那里，因为缺水而发生旱灾，1938年到1940年就有几十万头牲畜成群地死去。而在旁遮普，河水在雨季时却泛滥成灾，或者白白地流掉了。水，印度话叫做“班尼”，是那么神圣、珍贵而又可怕！
    这就不难理解为什么灌溉、动力和农业投资在印度的五年计划中占着那样重要的地位（在第一个五年计划中占总投资的43.2％，在第二个五年计划中占总投资的30.8％）。
    在德里西北二百多英里的巴克拉—南加尔水利、电力、灌溉综合工程就是印度第一个五年计划中的大建设之一。这个投资达十七亿卢比的气魄雄伟的工程，到1960年完工时将在贺希阿泊尔县境的大山中筑成一座六百八十英尺高（大约相当六十层楼的高度）的大水闸，把奔腾的苏特里杰河拦腰挡住，然后把汹涌的河水和倾盆的雨水纳入溪谷里，变成一个长八十公里宽五公里的人工大湖，从而使旁遮普、拉贾斯坦和北方邦的广大地区免于灾难，并且在需要的时候把水送到渴望甘露的农田和菜园里去。此外，那里还将建成两座规模巨大的水力发电站，拥有十部水力涡轮机，可发电九万瓩，供应一百三十个大小市镇和五千个村庄的用电。
    周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理乘着敞篷汽车在万人夹道欢呼声中通过挂满中印国旗披上了节日盛装的南加尔水闸。建筑工人、家属、儿童和邻近的农民成群地跟着汽车在路旁追赶欢呼。巨大的水坝的两旁密密层层的坐满了人，身穿鲜艳多彩的民族服装的旁遮普妇女聚集在一起组成一幅瑰丽的图画。
    过了水闸，汽车沿着陡峭弯曲的山路开进一条狭窄的山谷中。高耸的山峦和垂直辟开的石壁上迎面写着怵目惊心的大标语：险道！开慢车！安全行驶！
    汽车差不多是以“乙”形盘旋上山的，客人们来到了著名的巴克拉工地。
    总工程师孔加尔和建设工程的其他负责工程师们把保护头部用的白色的钢盔分发给客人们戴上，然后在工地上的一个工程模型旁向客人们讲解。
    巴克拉—南加尔工程包括五大部分：一、巴克拉水闸。二、南加尔水闸。三、南加尔水电水道。四、南加尔发电站。五、巴克拉运河系统。
      “这个迄今是世界最高的巴克拉重力坝是从1948年动工的。”总工程师说。
    这位秃顶的、已经和洪水打了二、三十年交道的印度老工程师一边指点着一边叙述着巴克拉—南加尔工程的全部远大的计划和建设的过程。他说：多少世纪以来，印度人民在苦难中的梦想，现在终于变成现实了。他记得从1908年旁遮普还在英国人统治下的时候起，人们就谈论过这个工程的必要了。尼赫鲁总理这时插进来说：“这儿就是我朝拜的菩萨庙！”
    这儿是把一座岩山硬开辟出来的一块平地。前面，在一千七百英尺宽的两大巨峰之间，横跨着施工的铁架。像巨人一样高达一百五十英尺的三部吊车，伸着高耸入云的长臂，在拔海三千五百英尺高的两山之间来回摆动。一排排的大铁桶（每桶装混凝土八吨，由四部自动搅拌机装送，每装一桶不及二分钟）以每小时装运四百吨混凝土的速度像蚂蚁一样忙碌着。尼赫鲁告诉周总理：1955年11月他到这里主持了水闸基础工程的开工典礼，从那天起，机器就昼夜不停地把混凝土运送到工地上。现在每天所用的水泥价值二十万卢比。整个工程共需混凝土一亿四千万立方英尺，足够修筑一条从加尔各答到纽约的公路。工程要用这样大量的水泥，就需要有自己的一整套制造水泥的设备和运送水泥的自动化机器。总工程师说，解决水泥供应是建设工程的重要组成部分，而这些自动化设备都是由印度工程师自己设计的。这里有六英里长的传送履带，日夜不停地把水泥、沙子和小石头送给混凝土自动搅拌机。搅拌混凝土要用大量的水，因此，这里还建造了一个每天供应六百万吨水的自来水公司。
    周恩来总理和贺龙副总理走下工地观看了灌注混凝土基础的过程。各式各样的机器吼叫着，发出震耳欲聋的声音，身穿蓝色工服戴着钢盔的工人们正在紧张地劳动。工地上是用报话机指挥工作的。
    尼赫鲁总理接着又陪着周总理和贺龙副总理从横跨山谷的铁架上走过。从铁架上向下望，河床工地上的人只是一些活动的黑点。未来的水闸就这么高。它的上端长度一千七百英尺，下长三百二十英尺，顶上厚三十英尺，底下厚六百二十五英尺，状作梯形。总工程师告诉中国客人们：参加建设的工人有八千多人，其中有二百五十名工程师和技术人员，另外有二十五个美国顾问。
      “我们在复杂的实践中遇到了许多意料不到的困难，”总工程师说，“但是，也取得了高坝建筑的宝贵经验。”他指着堤坝两边的两个水道说，“我们花了三年工夫劈山，用五年的时间凿穿两条直径五十英尺各有半英里长的水道，这是为了让河水从这两条水道流出来，好露出河床来进行建设。”
    客人们被引进一条隧道里，这是准备将来安装水力涡轮机发电的，对面峭壁下有同样的另一条隧道。将来就要在这里建成两座拥有十部水力涡轮机的水力发电站。
    峭壁的走廊上，工人们正在开动着风钻在岩壁上凿洞。据说，这是因为水闸太大，在发现两旁的岩石不够坚固后采取的补救办法。这些洞将用空气压缩机向里面灌注水泥。
    环绕着各处建设工程参观之后，尼赫鲁总理又邀周恩来总理登上工程最高处的山顶眺望未来的人工大湖——这个大湖所储的水可灌溉一千万英亩的土地。苏特里杰河像一条巨龙盘曲着横躺在群山的环抱中。远处村落点点，大约不下三四百个。过去，这大片地方都是比拉斯普尔王公的领地。独立后，王公的势力是削弱了。为了建造这座大坝和人工湖，这一带的居民将迁移到别的地方去，他们的土地由政府按官价给以赔偿，王公也不例外。一个印度记者说：这叫做“巴克拉湖水淹没了封建势力”！
    在参观了建设工程之后，当天下午，中印两位总理便在苏特里杰河畔的一座精巧雅静的小亭子里继续会谈。（1月1日寄自新德里）
