Xinhua News Agency, Budapest News: According to TASS, the Hungarian Production Cooperative Council held a meeting in Budapest on the 29th. Dobi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic and Chairman of the Production Cooperative Council, spoke at the meeting.

He pointed out that due to past mistakes and the activities of counter-revolutionary forces, the number of Hungarian production cooperatives decreased from 3,930 to 2,000 between September 1st and December 20th of this year. Counter-revolutionaries using violence destroyed some good and consolidated cooperatives in some places. However, at present, in many states, new cooperatives are being established in places where cooperatives were dissolved.

Dobi continued that the government will continue to firmly support production cooperatives. The government has already abolished those orders and resolutions that hindered the development of production cooperatives and restricted the initiative of members of production cooperatives. In addition, the government is prepared to implement many new measures to promote the development of agriculture, including cooperative agriculture. In the future, production cooperatives will work on an independent basis. Under the new conditions, all possibilities will be created so that any form of labor peasant production group can achieve the best results.

Dobi concluded by saying that we will continue to carry out the socialist construction of our country. This means that in agriculture, we will continue to build a large-scale cooperative economy on the basis of wise and persevering policies, correct past mistakes, and prevent such mistakes from happening again in the future.

    道比在匈生产合作社理事会上说
    匈政府将促进农业合作化
    新华社讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利生产合作社理事会29日在布达佩斯举行了会议，匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席、生产合作社理事会主席道比在会上讲了话。
    他指出，由于过去所犯的错误和反革命势力的活动，匈牙利生产合作社的数目在今年9月1日到12月20日这段期间从三千九百三十个减少到两千个。使用暴力的反革命在有些地方破坏了一些好的和巩固的合作社。但是目前在许多州，在合作社被解散了的地方又在建立起新的合作社。
    道比继续说，政府仍将坚决支持生产合作社。政府已经取消了妨碍生产合作社的发展和束缚了生产合作社社员的主动精神的那些命令和决议。此外，政府准备实行许多新的措施，以促进农业、其中包括合作社农业的发展。将来，生产合作社将在独立的基础上进行工作。在新的条件下将创造出一切可能性，以使任何形式的劳动农民生产组合都能获得最好的成果。
    道比最后说，我们将继续进行我们国家的社会主义建设。这就是说，在农业方面，我们将继续在明智和坚忍不拔的政策的基础上建设大规模的合作社经济，纠正过去的错误和不使将来再犯这种错误。
