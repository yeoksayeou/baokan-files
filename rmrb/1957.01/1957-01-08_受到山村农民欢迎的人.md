    Someone Welcomed by Mountain Village Farmers
    Guo Bingfu, the director of the Chengguan Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, is a good cadre who enthusiastically serves the farmers. Every day, he carries a shoulder pole, going to mountain villages more than 20 li away from Chengguan to purchase local products, and then carries them back. By doing this, he can not only promptly purchase dozens of types of local products scattered in the mountain villages to meet the needs of the city, but also help farmers turn their surplus local products into cash (with prices calculated according to the Chengguan purchase price), and save farmers time traveling back and forth between urban and rural areas, further improving agricultural production. Therefore, he has been warmly welcomed and unanimously praised by the farmers in the mountain villages. ·Zhong Xun·

    受到山村农民欢迎的人
    山西平顺县城关供销合作社主任郭丙福，是个热情为农民服务的好干部。他每天都挑着一副担子，到离城关二十里地以外的山村去收购土产品，然后再挑了回来。他这样做，既能把分散在山村的几十种土产品及时收购回来供应城市的需要，又能帮助农民把多余的土产品变成现款（价格仍按城关的收购价格来计算），还能使农民省去往返城乡的时间，进一步搞好农业生产。因此，他受到了山村农民的热烈欢迎和同声赞扬。　·锺迅·
