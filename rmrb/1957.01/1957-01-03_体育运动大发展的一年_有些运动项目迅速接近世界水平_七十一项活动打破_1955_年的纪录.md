    体育运动大发展的一年
    有些运动项目迅速接近世界水平
    七十一项活动打破1955年的纪录
    本报讯　我国的体育运动事业在去年的一年中有很大的发展。在广泛地开展群众性的体育运动的基础上，我国有些运动项目迅速地接近了世界水平。我国著名的举重运动员陈镜开曾打破了最轻量级挺举的世界纪录。射击运动员张鈜的手枪速射人像靶的纪录比十六届奥林匹克冠军还要多三环。举重的最轻量级、轻量级、男子二百公尺蛙泳、女子铁饼等项目都达到十六届奥林匹克前六名以上的成绩。撑竿跳高和男子跳远也接近了这届奥林匹克第六名的成绩。
    去年一年中，我国运动员曾打破了田径、游泳、举重、滑冰、自行车等七十一个单项的1955年全国最高纪录，1955年全国最高纪录中，男子二百公尺、一百十公尺高栏、撑竿跳高等项目都是二十年来始终没有打破的，去年一年中全部刷新了。目前唯一没有被突破纪录的是男子一百公尺。
