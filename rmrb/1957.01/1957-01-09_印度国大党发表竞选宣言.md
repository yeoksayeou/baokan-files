Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 8th: The Indian National Congress's 62nd Congress, after making certain revisions to the Indian National Congress's election manifesto, which was published as a draft on November 29th of last year, unanimously passed the manifesto on January 4th.

The manifesto states, "The Indian revolution can only be completed when the political revolution is followed by an economic and social revolution," and this economic and social revolution is being gradually realized in India according to India's own characteristics and methods. The manifesto says that in this way, it can finally "give everyone freedom, happiness, and equal opportunities."

The manifesto states that the National Congress advocates balanced development of industry and agriculture in the Second Five-Year Plan. It says: "The development of heavy industry is extremely important, but this must be balanced by small-scale and cottage industries."

The manifesto considers the nationalization of national banks and life insurance companies as "another step towards a socialist pattern." However, it does not intend to nationalize existing private industries unless those industries are necessary for the plan or they occupy a crucial position in the country's economy. "Private industry will be encouraged, but always in accordance with the needs of the plan."

In agriculture, the manifesto calls for achieving the target set by the Planning Commission of increasing grain production by approximately 30% during the plan period. The manifesto emphasizes that in order to achieve this target, it is necessary to organize rural cooperatives. The manifesto states that all intermediaries of land "must be gradually eliminated to achieve land to the tiller." The manifesto also calls for the gradual implementation of maximum limits on land ownership.

When talking about the widespread unemployment problem, the manifesto says that developing industry, especially small-scale industry and rural industry, will help solve this problem. The manifesto emphasizes the need for "concerted efforts in a peaceful environment." The manifesto says, "There should be peace in industry, and there should also be peace in our educational institutions that train people to take on national responsibilities. Strikes and factory closures are particularly harmful when the main purpose is to increase production."

In international affairs, the manifesto states: "India has consistently followed the path of peace and friendship with all countries," and the aim of its foreign policy has always been "to avoid war," to oppose the Cold War, "which maintains a state of war mentality and promotes the arms race." The manifesto calls for the peaceful incorporation of the Portuguese-occupied Indian territory of Goa into India.

The manifesto condemns the South African government for implementing a policy of racial conflict.

When mentioning its policy towards Pakistan, the manifesto says that India fully agrees with the partition of the country and the independence of Pakistan, and will continue to pursue peaceful means to resolve the Kashmir issue. The manifesto welcomes the new constitution of Kashmir.

The manifesto emphasizes the close relationship between India and Asian and African countries as specifically demonstrated by the historically significant Bandung Conference, and calls on other countries to understand the changes taking place in these countries and not to treat them with "the old methods of colonialism," because "such attempts are doomed to failure."

The manifesto specifically mentions the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence declared by India and China. "Only on the basis of these principles can world peace be guaranteed." Regarding the close relationship between India and China, the manifesto says, "In these years, China has established the People's Republic and has developed into a rapidly advancing powerful country." The manifesto points out that China is a great neighbor of India, and although they differ in their political and economic structures, they have good-neighborly and friendly relations. India has been seeking the restoration of China's seat in the United Nations year after year, but unfortunately, this has been opposed by some countries. If the United Nations does not include this large country with nearly a quarter of the world's population, it cannot become a fully representative world organization. Without China's cooperation, the problems of the Far East or Southeast Asia cannot be solved either.

The manifesto concludes by saying that the National Congress "is determined to work for the progress of the Indian people and for world peace."

    印度国大党发表竞选宣言
    新华社新德里8日电　印度国大党第六十二次代表大会在对去年11月29日作为草案发表的印度国大党竞选宣言作了某些修改以后，在1月4日一致通过了这个宣言。
    宣言说，“只有在政治革命以后继之以经济的和社会的革命，印度的革命才能完成”，这种经济的和社会的革命正在按照印度自己的特征和方法逐步在印度实现。宣言说，这样，最后就可以“给予一切人自由、幸福和平等的机会”。
    宣言说，国大党主张在第二个五年计划中均衡地发展工业和农业。它说：“重工业的发展是极端重要的，但是这必须用小型工业和家庭工业来保持均衡。”
    宣言认为国家银行和人寿保险公司的国有化是“走向社会主义式样的另一个步骤”。但是它并不打算把现有的私营工业收归国有，除非那些工业对于计划是必要的，或是它们在国家的经济中居于要害地位。“私营工业将会受到鼓励，但是始终是按照计划的需要”。
    在农业方面，宣言要求达到计划委员会规定的在计划时期粮食增产约30％这一指标。宣言着重强调为了达到这个指标，需要组织农村合作社。宣言说，所有土地的中间人都“必须逐步消除，以达到土地为耕者所有。”，宣言并要求逐步实行土地占有的最高限额。
    宣言在谈到广泛的失业问题的时候说：发展工业、特别是发展小型工业和农村工业，将有助于解决这个问题。宣言强调指出有必要在“安宁的情况下作出共同的努力”。宣言说，“在工业方面应该有安宁，在我国那些训练人们负起国家责任的教育机关中也应该有安宁。当主要目的是为了增加生产的时候，罢工和关闭工厂都是特别有害的。”
    在国际事务方面，宣言说：“印度一贯遵循和平和同各国友好的道路”，它的外交政策的目的一向是“避免战争”，反对冷战，“冷战保持着战争的心理状态，并且促进军备竞赛”。宣言要求用和平的方式把葡萄牙所占领的印度领土果阿并入印度。
    宣言谴责南非政府执行种族冲突的政策。
    宣言在提到对巴基斯坦的政策时说，印度完全赞同国家分治和巴基斯坦独立，对于克什米尔问题将继续奉行和平办法。宣言对克什米尔的新宪法表示欢迎。
    宣言着重指出具有历史意义的万隆会议所具体表明的印度同亚非国家的密切关系，并且要求其他国家了解在这些国家中发生的变化，不要用“殖民主义的老办法”来对待它们，因为“这样的企图注定要遭到失败”。
    宣言特别提到印度和中国所宣布的和平共处五项原则。“只有在这些原则的基础上，世界和平才能得到保证。”关于印度和中国的密切关系，宣言说，“在这几年中，中国建立了人民共和国，并且发展成了正在迅速前进的强国。”宣言指出，中国是印度的一个伟大的邻邦，尽管它们在政治和经济结构方面有所不同，它们有着睦邻的和友好的关系。印度年复一年地在谋求恢复中国在联合国的地位，但是不幸，这遭到了一些国家的反对。如果联合国不把这个拥有将近世界四分之一人口的大国包括在内的话，它就不可能成为一个具有充分代表性的世界组织。如果没有中国的合作，远东或东南亚问题也不可能解决。
    宣言最后说，国大党“决心为印度人民的进步和世界和平而努力”。
