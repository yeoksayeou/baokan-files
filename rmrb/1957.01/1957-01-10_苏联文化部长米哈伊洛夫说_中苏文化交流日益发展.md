Xinhua News Agency, 9th. TASS reports: Soviet Minister of Culture Mikhailov stated in an article published in “Pravda” on January 7th, discussing cultural exchanges between the Soviet Union and China, that the Soviet Union's interest in the cultural life of the fraternal Chinese people is constantly growing. In the past six years, the Soviet Union has published more than 370 different works by Chinese writers in Russian, totaling approximately 20 million copies. The works of Chinese writers have been published in more than 30 languages of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union. Comrade Mao Zedong's works occupy an important position among these publications.

Mikhailov pointed out that the exchange of films between the two countries and the joint production of films by filmmakers have opened up broad prospects for further cultural ties. Soviet audiences have learned about the dramatic arts of the Chinese people through performances by some Chinese theater troupes in the Soviet Union. The Chinese arts and crafts exhibition held in the Soviet Union achieved great success, attracting more than one million visitors in a short period of time.

Mikhailov said that the Sino-Soviet Cultural Cooperation Agreement concluded in 1956 is of particular importance to both countries.

Mikhailov pointed out that the effective cooperation between scientists of the two countries is not only reflected in the exchange of many delegations, but also in the joint scientific research work of scientists from both countries on various issues. Works jointly written by Soviet and Chinese scientists on ancient Chinese philosophers, the history of Russian-Chinese and Soviet-Chinese relations, etc., are about to be published. With the help of Chinese anthropologists, the Soviet Union is preparing to publish a monumental work entitled "The Chinese Nation," which is a very important part of the "Peoples of the World" series.

Mikhailov said that the new development of relations between the Soviet Union and China creates unlimited possibilities for developing cultural ties in all aspects. (Attached image)

    苏联文化部长米哈伊洛夫说
    中苏文化交流日益发展
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联文化部长米哈伊洛夫1月7日在“真理报”发表的一篇讲述苏联和中国之间的文化交流的文章说，苏联对兄弟中国人民的文化生活的兴趣不断提高。在最近六年中，苏联用俄文出版了三百七十多种不同的中国作家的作品，共计约为两千万册。中国作家的作品用苏联各民族三十种以上的文字出版了。毛泽东同志的著作在这些作品中占据着重要的地位。
    米哈伊洛夫指出，两国互换影片和电影工作者共同摄制影片等，为进一步的文化联系开辟了广阔的前景。苏联观众通过一些中国剧团到苏联的演出了解了中国人民的戏剧艺术。在苏联展出的中国工艺美术展览会获得了很大的成就：它在短时期内，就吸引了一百多万观众。
    米哈伊洛夫说，1956年缔结的苏中文化合作协定对两国具有特别重要的意义。
    米哈伊洛夫指出，两国科学家之间的有效合作不仅表现在互派许多代表团上，而且表现在两国科学家就各种问题共同进行科学研究的工作上。苏中两国科学家合著的有关中国古代哲学家的著作，俄国—中国、苏联—中国关系史等著作就要出版。在中国人种学家的帮助之下，苏联正准备出版一本巨著“中国民族”，这部书是“世界民族”全集中的很重要一部分。
    米哈伊洛夫说，苏联和中国之间的关系的新发展为在各方面发展文化联系创造了无限的可能性。（附图片）
