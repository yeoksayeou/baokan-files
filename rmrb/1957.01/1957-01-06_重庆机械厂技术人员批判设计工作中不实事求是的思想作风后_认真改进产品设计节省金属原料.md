Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 5th. After criticizing the unrealistic work style, the one-sided pursuit of aesthetics, and sticking to conventions in design work, the technicians of Chongqing Machinery Factory started to improve the product design of this year and opened up a large number of new ways to save metal materials and reduce costs.

When discussing increasing production and practicing economy recently, the technicians of Chongqing General Machinery Factory reviewed and criticized the unrealistic, one-sided pursuit of aesthetics and sticking to conventions and other ideological styles in the past design work. They unanimously proposed to implement the ideas of diligence and thrift, careful calculation, and economic practicality in product design, and actively give play to their creativity. They put forward many suggestions for improving the design of the products produced by the factory this year, such as using bamboo instead of steel plates to manufacture the wind hood of axial flow fans, and studying and improving the product design of blowers and petroleum pumping units. After these suggestions are implemented, it is estimated that the factory can save more than 200 tons of metal this year.

The technicians of Chongqing Diesel Engine Factory, who are carrying out a competition to improve the quality of design work and save raw materials, considered modifying and simplifying the machine structure according to the Soviet design drawings and the opinions of the users when considering improving the design of water turbines. A total of 78 parts that did not actually work, such as brakes and pull rods, were eliminated. At the same time, after practical calculations, the excessive safety factor of the originally designed water turbine volute and tail was modified, so that their thickness was reduced from the original 20 to 30 cm to 10 to 15 cm. After these improvements, the factory can save more than 100 tons of metal and a lot of man-hours just by producing water turbines this year, and the cost of each water turbine can be reduced by 30% compared to the original.

The technicians of Qijiang Automobile Parts Factory are also starting to improve the product design of this year. Engineer Lai Yuanda proposed to change the design of the copper sleeve of the spring steel plate, and change the copper sleeve originally made of copper material to be made of plastic, which can save pure copper consumption and reduce the cost by 58%.

    重庆机械厂技术人员批判设计工作中不实事求是的思想作风后
    认真改进产品设计节省金属原料
    新华社重庆5日电　重庆市机械工厂的技术人员从改进今年的产品设计着手，开辟大量节约金属材料和降低成本的新门路。
    重庆通用机器厂的技术人员最近讨论增产节约的时候，检查和批判了过去在设计工作中不实事求是、片面追求美观和墨守陈规等思想作风，一致提出要在设计产品中贯彻克勤克俭、精打细算和经济实用的思想，积极发挥创造性。他们对全厂今年生产的产品提出了许多改进设计的建议，如利用竹子代替钢板制造轴流式送风机的套风筒、研究改进鼓风机和石油抽油机的产品设计等。这些建议实现以后，预计厂内今年可以节约金属两百多吨。
    正在开展提高设计工作质量、节约原材料竞赛的重庆柴油机厂的技术人员，在考虑改进水轮机设计的时候，根据苏联设计图纸和使用单位的意见，把机器结构加以修改和简化，共取消了煞车、拉竿等实际上不起作用的零件七十八种；同时，经过切实计算，把原来设计的水轮机涡壳和尾的过大保险系数加以修改，使它们的厚度由原来二十到三十公分减为十到十五公分。经过这些改进，这个厂今年仅生产水轮机一项，就可以节约一百多吨金属和大量工时，每台水轮机的成本能比原来降低30％。
    綦江汽车配件厂的技术人员，也正在着手改进今年的产品设计。工程师来元达提出改变弹簧钢板的铜套设计，把原来用铜料制造的铜套改为用塑料制造，可以节省纯铜消耗，成本降低58％。
