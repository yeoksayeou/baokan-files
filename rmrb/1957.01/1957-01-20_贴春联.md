Pasting Spring Couplets

Every time New Year's Day and the Spring Festival arrive, I always think of Spring Couplets.

Spring Couplets are familiar to everyone. Many Spring Couplets have rich and colorful content, and the matching is extremely clever, giving people a poetic feeling when reading them. The people love this form very much, so it has been passed down to this day.

Since Liberation, many new couplets with novel content have emerged, praising the new society and praising the happy life. This is a gratifying phenomenon. But behind this gratifying phenomenon, there are also shortcomings, that is, the content of our current couplets seems to be somewhat monotonous, dry and boring, both poor and monotonous. For example, near my hometown, I saw that dozens of households in a village only had two types of content: "Develop production and prosper the economy" and "Do a good job in patriotic production and increase social income." Although the situation in cities is slightly better, it is not as good as in the past.

Why have Spring Couplets become so枯燥單調枯燥單調 (kūzào dāndiào - boring and monotonous)? I think it is probably because some departments lack due attention to this issue and have not guided folk artists and intellectuals to engage in writing work. Second, a large part of the masses, although they like some of the past couplets very much, feel that they are outdated, and dare not write them for fear of being criticized. In fact, in this era, there are many things worth writing about! Our relevant departments should pay attention to leading this issue, mobilize the intellectuals among the masses to write new couplets that can reflect the face of our real life, print them into booklets, and meet the needs of the people. In addition, we should carefully identify and sort out the old couplets that have been circulated, and inherit those excellent things that the people love to see.

    贴春联
    每逢到了新年和春节，我总想到春联。
    春联对谁都不陌生。有许多春联内容丰富多采，对的也极其巧妙，读起来给人们以诗的感受。人民群众都非常喜爱这种形式，所以一直流传到今天。
    解放以来，又出现了不少内容新颖的新对联歌颂新社会，歌颂幸福的生活。这是个可喜的现象。但是在这可喜的后面也有美中不足的地方，就是我们现在对联的内容显得有些千篇一律，干干巴巴，既贫乏又单调。例如在我们家乡附近，我看见一个村几十户人家只有“发展生产，繁荣经济”和“搞好爱国生产，增加社会收入”两种内容。城市里虽然稍微好一些，但也不如过去。
    为什么春联变得这样枯燥单调了呢？我想，大约由于有些部门对这个问题缺乏应有的注意，没有指导民间艺人和知识阶层从事编写工作。第二是有很大一部分群众虽然很喜欢过去的某些对联，但却又认为它已经陈旧了，不敢写，怕别人说长道短。其实，在这样的时代里，有许多东西值得大书特书！我们有关部门应该注意对这个问题的领导，并动员群众中间的知识阶层编写一些能够反映我们现实生活面貌的新对联，印成小册子，满足人民的需要。另外，对已经流传的旧春联，应当认真鉴别一下，加以整理，把那些优良的、人民喜闻乐见的东西继承下来。
