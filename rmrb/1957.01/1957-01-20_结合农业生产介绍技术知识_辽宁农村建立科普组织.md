Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th. Since the fourth quarter of 1956, Liaoning Province has been working to establish science and technology popularization organizations in rural areas. To date, 15 counties and banners have established science and technology popularization associations, and 17 counties and banners have established preparatory bodies.

According to statistics from 18 counties and banners, there are currently more than 3,000 science popularization association members and 172 science propagandists, who are widely publicizing scientific and health knowledge in rural areas and introducing agricultural technical knowledge in conjunction with agricultural production. The Kuandian County Science and Technology Popularization Association has successively compiled 24 kinds of lecture scripts, such as "Sun-drying and Storage of Seeds," "Curing Tobacco Storage," and "Silage Feed," and has held more than 400 lectures in the county seat and 35 townships. The Jin County Science and Technology Popularization Association cooperated with the agricultural department to run night schools, training 170 young farmers. Before the silkworm cocoon harvest, members of the Fengcheng County Tussah Silkworm Experimental Station's Science and Technology Popularization Association divided into seven groups and went deep into key tussah silkworm areas to explain to agricultural cooperative cadres knowledge such as "Selection, Transportation, and Winter Protection of Tussah Silkworms."
