    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 12th: The United Front Work Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) held a symposium with democratic figures during the New Year period to listen to their opinions.

    Recently, the heads of various democratic parties' Jiangsu provincial organizations, as well as non-Party ethnic minority figures, lecturers and teaching assistants from universities and colleges, returned overseas Chinese, senior medical personnel, figures from the literary and art circles, figures from the Catholic, Christian, Buddhist, and Taoist communities, and democratic figures serving as vice governors and directors of various departments and bureaus in Jiangsu Province, totaling more than 200 people, attended more than ten symposiums. They reflected to the United Front Work Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the CCP on problems in the work of some units of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and opinions on the cooperative working relationships between certain Communist Party members and cadres with democratic figures.

    Chen Minzhi, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said that in the past, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the CCP had three relatively good methods of contacting and leading the democratic parties: first, the Provincial Committee would report to us on principles, policies, and major events at certain times; second, the United Front Work Department would convene our committee members, department heads, division chiefs, etc., to exchange opinions and understand the situation; and third, it would convene our full-time cadres for discussions. In recent months, the leadership of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the CCP over us has not been as frequent as before, and the explanation of principles and policies to us has not been as timely as before. He proposed that the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the CCP must continue to strengthen its ideological leadership over the democratic parties in the future.

    Gao Juefu, Deputy Director of the Nanjing Branch of the Jiusan Society, reflected that the difference in salary levels in universities and colleges was too large. The salary reform did not take into account the administrative work of department heads, creating a phenomenon where everyone only wants to advance in science and is unwilling to do administrative work.

    Many people at these symposiums also used concrete facts to expose the problems of bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism that existed in some units and among certain Communist Party members in Jiangsu Province, and put forward many criticisms and suggestions. The United Front Work Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the CCP will handle these opinions separately and contact relevant parties to further improve the work.

    江苏省委统战部召开座谈会
    听取民主人士的批评和意见
    新华社南京12日电　中共江苏省委统战部新年期间召开了民主人士座谈会，听取意见。
    最近各民主党派江苏省组织的负责人，以及党外的少数民族人士、大专学校讲师和助教、归国华侨、高级医务人员、文艺界人士、天主教、基督教、佛教和道教界人士，以及担任江苏省副省长和各厅、局长的民主人士等共二百多人，分别在十多个座谈会上向中共江苏省委统战部反映了共产党和人民政府一些单位在工作中的问题和某些共产党员、干部同民主人士合作共事关系等方面的意见。
    民盟江苏省委员会主任委员陈敏之说，过去中共江苏省委对民主党派的领导，有三种联系的方法比较好：第一是省委在一定时期对我们作关于方针、政策、重大事件的报告；第二是统战部召集我们的委员、部长、处长等交换意见，了解情况；第三是召集我们的专职干部座谈。最近几个月来，中共江苏省委对我们的领导不像以前那样经常了，对我们交代方针、政策也不像以前那样及时了。他提出：今后中共江苏省委必须对民主党派继续加强政策思想的领导。
    九三学社南京分社副主任委员高觉敷反映，在高等学校中工资改革级别差额太大，在工资改革中没有照顾到系主任的行政工作，造成大家只向科学进军，不愿干行政工作的现象。
    许多人在这些座谈会上还用具体事实，揭发了江苏省有些单位和某些共产党员在工作上存在的官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义等毛病，并且提出了许多批评和建议。中共江苏省委统战部将根据这些意见，分别予以处理，并同有关方面联系，以进一步改进工作。
