Xinhua News Agency, January 1st - The National Trade Union Propaganda Work Conference, which closed on December 31, 1956, regarded political and ideological education for workers as an imminent task. The conference decided to strengthen the leadership of trade union propaganda work and further improve the political and ideological education of workers.

The conference studied the current ideological situation of workers and believed that with the rapid progress of China's socialist construction, a large number of small producers and members of other classes have joined the ranks of the working class, bringing with them non-working-class ideologies. This has increased the complexity of the ideological situation within the working class. Therefore, trade union propaganda work should regard political and ideological education for workers as an imminent task. Trade unions should always pay attention to the actual conditions in various regions and periods, deeply publicize the Party's general line, and repeatedly publicize the Party's leading role; constantly explain the domestic and international situation to workers, and enhance their patriotism and internationalism; educate workers to establish communist moral character, strengthen internal unity within the working class, and further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance; constantly pay attention to publicizing the idea that labor is glorious and to cherish public property, and enhance workers' sense of honor and responsibility; educate workers to understand the correct relationship between individuals and enterprises, and between individuals and the country, establish a sense of responsibility as masters, so that they consciously abide by labor discipline, develop a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity. At the same time, in propaganda, they should also pay attention to explaining to them the principle that the material and cultural life of the working class can only be gradually improved on the basis of developing production. In addition, trade unions should also frequently publicize scientific knowledge to workers, helping them establish a materialist worldview.

The conference pointed out that the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement is an important task put forward by the Party based on the current situation, and the current trade union propaganda work should take it as the main content of propaganda. The conference believes that in this propaganda, in addition to publicizing the idea that labor is glorious, it is also necessary to publicize the improvement of technology and mastery of new technologies, publicize the study of advanced experience, and repeatedly publicize the principles of the advanced producers movement. At the same time, it is necessary to publicize overcoming the one-sidedness of increasing production and practicing economy, such as not paying attention to quality and not paying attention to safety.

The conference believes that to improve the level of trade union propaganda work, it is necessary to strengthen daily specific leadership. The conference requested trade unions at all levels to regularly inspect and discuss trade union propaganda work; establish and improve the organization of the grassroots trade union propaganda work committee, and establish a normal order for propaganda work; run various trade union cultural undertakings well; local trade unions and industrial trade unions should strengthen their leadership over grassroots propaganda work; and it is required that in grassroots trade union propaganda work, the role of activists should be fully utilized. The conference emphasized that rectifying the order of grassroots trade union propaganda work is of great significance for strengthening the ideological and mass character of trade union propaganda work.

The conference believes that it is necessary to change the style of trade union propaganda work, requiring trade union propaganda cadres to go deep into reality, raise problems from the actual life of workers, and solve problems. In particular, they must be good at using typical examples and the personal experiences of the masses to educate the masses.

The conference specifically studied the trade union propaganda work for 1957, and determined that in addition to strengthening political and ideological education and the propaganda of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, it is also required to universally publicize the policy of redemption in public-private joint ventures throughout the country. At the same time, it was decided to rectify the order of trade union propaganda work, continue to strengthen the management of cultural undertakings, and strengthen the training of trade union propaganda cadres and activists.

This conference started on December 20, 1956. Participants included heads of propaganda departments of trade unions in various provinces and cities, and some grassroots trade union propaganda workers.

    随着工人队伍的扩大　带来复杂的思想情况
    加强职工政治思想教育刻不容缓
    全国工会宣传工作会议研究了今年的具体任务
    新华社1日讯　1956年12月31日闭幕的全国工会宣传工作会议，把对职工进行政治思想教育工作，当作迫不容缓的任务。会议决定加强工会宣传工作的领导，进一步做好职工政治思想教育工作。
    会议研究了当前职工的思想情况，认为随着我国社会主义建设事业的飞跃进展，大量的小生产者和其他阶级的成员加入到工人阶级的队伍中来，带来了非工人阶级的思想意识，这样就增加了工人阶级队伍中思想情况的复杂性。因此，工会宣传工作应把对职工进行政治思想教育工作当作迫不容缓的任务。工会应该经常注意根据各地各个时期的实际情况，深入地宣传党的总路线，反复地宣传党的领导作用；经常向职工解释国内外的情况，提高职工的爱国主义和国际主义觉悟；教育职工树立共产主义道德品质，加强工人阶级的内部团结和进一步巩固工农联盟；经常注意向职工宣传劳动光荣和爱护公共财产的思想，提高职工的光荣感和责任感；教育职工认识个人与企业、个人与国家的正确关系，树立主人翁的责任感，使他们自觉地遵守劳动纪律，发扬高度的积极性和创造性，同时在宣传中还要注意向他们说明只有在发展生产的基础上才能逐步改善工人阶级的物质文化生活的道理。此外，工会还应该经常向职工宣传科学知识，帮助他们树立唯物主义世界观。
    会议指出：增产节约运动是党根据当前情况提出的重要任务，当前工会宣传工作应把它作为主要的宣传内容。会议认为在这一宣传中，除了宣传劳动光荣的思想以外，还要宣传提高技术和掌握新技术，宣传学习先进经验，反复宣传先进生产者运动的原则。同时要宣传克服增产节约的片面性，如不注意质量，不注意安全等。
    会议认为要提高工会宣传工作水平，必须加强日常的具体领导。会议要求各级工会定期检查和讨论工会宣传工作；建立和健全基层工会宣传工作委员会的组织，建立宣传工作正常秩序；办好工会各项文化事业；地方工会和产业工会都要加强对基层宣传工作的领导；并且要求在基层工会宣传工作中，充分发挥积极分子的作用。会议着重指出了整顿工会基层宣传工作秩序、对于加强工会宣传工作的思想性和群众性有着重要的意义。
    会议认为必须改变工会宣传工作作风，要求工会宣传干部深入实际，从职工的实际生活中提出问题，解决问题。特别要善于运用典型事例和群众的切身体验来教育群众。
    会议具体研究了1957年的工会宣传工作，确定除了加强政治思想教育和增产节约运动的宣传外，并且要求在全国的公私合营企业中普遍地宣传一次赎买政策。同时确定整顿工会宣传工作秩序，继续加强文化事业的管理、加强工会宣传干部和积极分子的训练工作。
    这次会议是在1956年12月20日开始的。参加会议的有各省、市工会宣传部负责人、部分基层工会宣传工作人员。
