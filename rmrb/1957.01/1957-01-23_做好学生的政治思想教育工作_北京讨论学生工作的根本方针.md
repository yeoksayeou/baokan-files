Xinhua News Agency, January 21st: The student work conference held by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China concluded on the 21st. The four-day meeting discussed the fundamental policy of student work, analyzed the current political and ideological situation of students, and determined future working methods. The leaders of the Party and League organizations of various universities and colleges in Beijing attended the meeting.

The meeting believed that student work is nothing but students' ideological education. Before the victory of the revolution, student work was for the victory of the revolution. After the victory of the revolution, everything was for the development of national construction. At present, our country is carrying out socialist construction, which can only rely on the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and accept the leadership of the Communist Party. Student work is to effectively serve the above requirements and make students become talents for socialist construction. This is the starting point for carrying out students' ideological work now, and also the standard for judging the quality of student work.

Currently, some people in schools believe that the domestic situation has changed, and we should vigorously promote learning technology to advance towards science, expand democratic life, and cultivate students' independent working ability. The meeting believed that raising these points is necessary, but they must be placed in the appropriate position, and there should be a prerequisite, which is to cultivate students into talents for socialist construction. Otherwise, even if the homework is learned well, if they lose their direction politically or have serious individualistic thoughts, it will be impossible to play a due role in the cause of socialist construction.

The meeting believed that the political and ideological situation of students in Beijing's universities and colleges is basically healthy. Students support socialism and are also very diligent in their studies. However, some unhealthy thoughts also exist among some students, such as excessive emphasis on democracy and individual freedom, and even requiring the collective to obey the individual. The meeting believed that the reason for this phenomenon is that ideological education has not been strengthened in a timely manner with the changes and development of the international and domestic situation. At the same time, some one-sidedness in propaganda work has caused students to have some incorrect understandings of the new situation. The meeting believed that these shortcomings should be treated with analysis and differentiation in order to achieve the goals of improving work and developing the enthusiasm of the masses.

Regarding future work, the meeting believed that in student work, we should still focus on publicizing the Party's general line, and carry out all work under the illumination of the general line. It should be emphasized that the program of political and ideological education in schools is to gradually overcome the thoughts of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie with the thoughts of the proletariat. This is an arduous and long-term task. In addition to conducting political and ideological education through regular course studies, it should also be carried out through some extracurricular activities or other effective methods. The meeting believed that the fundamental principles and fundamental lines should be firmly grasped in ideological education, but the working methods should be as flexible as possible and not require uniformity. The meeting pointed out that carrying out political and ideological work is to unite more people, mobilize all positive forces, and run the schools well.

    做好学生的政治思想教育工作
    北京讨论学生工作的根本方针
    新华社21日讯　中共北京市高等学校委员会举行的学生工作会议在21日结束。四天会议中讨论了学生工作的根本方针，分析了当前学生的政治思想状况，确定了今后的工作方法。参加会议的有北京各高等学校的党团组织的负责人。
    会议认为学生工作不是别的，而是学生的思想教育工作。在革命胜利以前，学生工作是为了革命胜利，革命胜利以后就一切为了国家建设的发展。目前我国是在进行社会主义建设，它只能依靠马克思列宁主义指导，接受共产党的领导。学生工作就是有效地服务于上述要求，使学生成为社会主义的建设人材。这是现在进行学生思想工作的出发点，也是学生工作的好坏标准。
    目前在学校中有些人认为国内形势起了变化，应当大力提倡学好技术向科学进军，扩大民主生活，培养学生独立的工作能力。会议认为提出这些是必要的，但必须把它摆在适当的位置上，而且应当有一个前提，就是要把学生培养成为社会主义建设人材。否则即使是功课学好了，但在政治上迷失了方向或者有严重的个人主义思想，就不可能在社会主义建设事业中，起到应有的作用。
    会议认为：目前北京高等学校中学生政治思想状况基本上是健康的。学生们拥护社会主义，学习上也很用功。但是，在有些学生中也存在着一些不健康的思想，如过份的强调民主和个人自由，甚至要求集体服从个人等。会议认为产生这种现象的原因，是没有随着国际国内形势的变化和发展，而及时加强思想教育，同时由于宣传工作中的某些片面性，使学生们对新的形势产生了一些错误的认识。会议认为应当有分析有区别地对待这些缺点，才能达到改进工作和发扬群众积极性的目的。
    对于今后工作，会议认为在学生工作中，还是应该着重宣传党的总路线，在总路线的照耀下进行一切工作。应该强调在学校里的政治思想教育纲领就是用无产阶级的思想来逐步地克服资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想。这是一个艰巨的长期的任务。进行政治思想教育的方法，除了要通过正课学习进行外，同时也要通过一些课外活动或其他有效的方式来进行。会议认为在思想教育中，根本原则根本路线应当抓紧，但工作方法应当尽量灵活些，不要强求一致。会议指出，进行政治思想工作，是为了团结更多的人，调动一切积极力量，把学校办好。
