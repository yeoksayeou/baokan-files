    The Soviet people, nurtured by the immortal ideas of Marxism-Leninism, appropriately and highly value the genuine achievements of Russian and world culture.

    Soviet scholars specifically and historically evaluate philosophical ideas, schools of thought, and trends of the past, striving to determine which social forces they served, which class interests they protected, and whether they promoted or hindered social progress. It goes without saying that the evaluation of ideas and schools of thought that promoted social progress will not be the same as the evaluation of those that hindered or resisted it.
    Soviet scholars have adopted this perspective toward the philosophical heritage of the past and have done much work and successfully waged a struggle against distorting and falsifying the history of philosophy, especially the history of their own philosophy.
    As everyone knows, in pre-Soviet Russia, autocratic, clerical, landlord, bourgeois, and petty-bourgeois historians of Russian social thought and philosophy devoted great effort to distorting the entire historical process of Russia, including the history of Russian philosophy. They lavishly praised reactionary religious mystical schools of thought, arguing that the ideas propagated by these schools' representatives seemed to conform to the national character of the Russian people. At the same time, they unconditionally rejected the principle of partisanship in philosophy, ignored the struggle between materialism and idealism, and promoted reactionary ideas such as: philosophy is non-partisan, philosophy should be indifferent to political struggles and political parties appearing in social life, philosophical conclusions must be in line with the teachings of the Old and New Testaments, and so on.
    Secondly, these anti-Marxist historians slandered the great Russian people, saying that they were a religious people, absolutely loyal to the Orthodox Church, the Tsar, and all supreme power, and that they sought no social change other than receiving the gifts of the Tsarist regime and the clergy. Therefore, they attempted to portray the religious mystical doctrines of the Slavophiles in the mid-nineteenth century, as well as religious idealist philosophy, as the truly Russian philosophy characteristic of the "Russian people," the "Russian spirit," and the "Russian worldview." Furthermore, the historians of the ruling class showed hostility towards all advanced materialist and atheist trends of thought in Russian and foreign philosophy, and despised the independence and originality of Russian materialists.
    In their notorious "Landmarks" collection (which Lenin called an "encyclopedia of liberal betrayal") published in 1909, the Constitutional Democrats attacked Russian materialist philosophy and advanced socio-political thought with intense hatred and undisguised hostility. Modern White Russian historians and bourgeois historians have written many books on the history of Russian philosophy, and they are now eagerly repeating the slanderous ideas of the "Landmarks" group. It is enough to point out Archpriest Florovsky's "The Ways of Russian Theology" (1937), Berdyaev's "The Russian Idea" (1945), Yakovenko's "History of Russian Philosophy" (1939), Archpriest Zekovsky's "History of Russian Philosophy" (1948-1950), Lossky's "History of Russian Philosophy" (1951), and so on, to prove this point. The authors of these books are not concerned with objectively elucidating the development of the socio-historical process (including the development of Russian philosophical thought), but with how to more cunningly and skillfully adapt it to fabricated formulas permeated with the spirit of clerical-monarchist or landlord-bourgeois partisanship. They verbally deny this partisanship every day, while in practice constantly implementing it.
    Soviet scholars, guided by the Marxist-Leninist theory of materialism and dialectical method, defend everything of value created by progressive Russian thinkers of past centuries, ensuring that they do not suffer distortion, vulgarization, or belittlement.
    Of course, Marxist-Leninist doctrine far surpasses the advanced political, philosophical, sociological, aesthetic, and other ideas of progressive thinkers in the past. However, this surpassing is not a random negation like that attempted by the so-called "Proletarian Culture Faction" at the time, but a thorough critical transformation of them based on the Marxist worldview, making them beneficial to the proletariat and other working classes. Therefore, the Soviet people did not kick aside the excellent parts of the philosophical heritage of the past, but reconsidered and critically accepted them from the standpoint of Marxism-Leninism.
    Soviet Marxists believe that those socio-political and philosophical schools of thought of the ancient feudal era that promoted the unification of small principalities into a unified and powerful centralized state, that is, a state capable of defending its independence and resolutely repelling enemies both at home and abroad who were undermining the union, played a progressive historical role at the time. The Soviet people have made correct evaluations of Ilarion's "On Law and Grace" (1037-1050) as well as works such as "The Tale of Bygone Years" (11th-14th centuries), "The Tale of Igor's Campaign" (12th century), and so on. These works each expressed the socio-historical demands that had matured at the time and were permeated with social ideas that were advanced for their time.
    During this period and in the period slightly later, folk oral creations occupied a special place, containing spontaneous materialist and freedom-loving democratic tendencies. Folk creations, such as proverbs, sayings, folk tales, folk songs, predictions, and legends, summarized the life experiences, socially formed clan and class relations, and observations of natural phenomena of the people over many centuries.
    During the 15th-17th centuries, the progressive forces in Russia struggled to establish and consolidate a centralized Russian state headed by Moscow, while reactionary forces resisted this. At that time, Russia's advanced thinkers were agitated by the fate of their motherland. Although they did not understand that the real driving force of social development lies in the material living conditions of society, they attempted to understand historical progress and sincerely wanted to promote the establishment of a strong centralized state. Their historical merit and role lie precisely here.
    The economic, philosophical, sociological, and ethical works of Pososhkov, Feofan Prokopovich, Tatishchev, and later Kantemir, were all written to theoretically argue for Peter the Great's reforms in Russia at the beginning of the 18th century. The philosophical works of Tatishchev, Prokopovich, and Kantemir were all permeated with dualism. These thinkers were aristocratic thinkers who supported Peter the Great's reforms, and they invoked the theory of "natural law and social contract" to advocate "enlightened despotism." In their view of the universe, Prokopovich, Tatishchev, and Kantemir insisted on the view that the world is indivisible and quantitatively infinite. They attached great importance to the doctrines of Copernicus, Galileo, Bacon, Hobbes, Descartes, and Locke.
    Lomonosov (1711-1765) played an outstanding role in the development of Russian and world culture. The merit of this scholar and thinker lies in the fact that he created a solid tradition of materialism in Russian philosophy and natural science, scientifically demonstrated the atomic-molecular theory of the material structure of materialism, the kinetic theory of gases, the kinetic theory of heat, and strongly opposed the phlogiston theory, considering it a mystical doctrine.
    Lomonosov not only rejected the first mover and declared that matter in motion is eternal, but also scientifically demonstrated the conservation of matter and motion in 1748 through experiments. At the same time, he put forward the ideas of the evolution and occurrence of rocks, soil, coal, and petroleum. Contrary to church doctrines, he believed that life was possible on other planets, and he warmly supported the heliocentric theory, believing that the universe is infinite and contains countless worlds. This great Russian thinker demanded that science develop independently of religion, that religion not interfere with scientific work; that science rely on facts, observations, and experiments, and that philosophy and science join hands to combine theory with practice.
    At the same time, Lomonosov enthusiastically advocated education, the training of local cadres, and the development of industry, agriculture, commerce, and navigation. He was the founder of Moscow University. Lomonosov's philosophical and scientific heritage has only been given sufficient attention in the Soviet era. At the same time, the Soviet people will naturally not forget the class limitations and scientific limitations of Lomonosov's philosophical heritage, and will not forget that his views on the material structure and the nature of material manifestations were mainly mechanistic in nature.
    In the second half of the 18th century, a powerful Enlightenment school emerged in Russia, whose main representatives were Popovsky, Novikov, Anichkov, Desnitsky, Kozelsky, and others, who prepared the ideological basis for the uprising of aristocratic revolutionaries.
    The ideas of the Enlightenment school were anti-feudal in essence and bourgeois in nature. The Enlightenment school criticized individual aspects of Russian serfdom; advocated education and humanism; denounced the ignorance, idleness, and inactivity of serf owners; denounced the corruption of officials and judges, sought to save the fate of serfs, and advocated the development of the material and spiritual strength of society. Some of the Enlightenment school, such as Anichkov, Kozelsky, Baturlin, and Slovtsov, developed in some form materialist views on nature and its phenomena, the origin and nature of human knowledge. Although their materialism was mechanistic in nature, it played a progressive role at the time, striking at religious mystical and idealist doctrines, and enlightening people to believe in reason, science, and education.
    At the end of the 18th century, Radishchev published his famous revolutionary work in Russia: "A Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow." In this book, he made a devastating critique of the domestic autocracy and feudal serf system. The autocratic system brutally persecuted Radishchev, sentencing him to death, which was later commuted to exile. The Soviet people are proud of Radishchev and give him a high evaluation, primarily because he laid the foundation for the revolutionary tradition of advanced social thought in Russia.
    In his philosophical work "On Man, His Mortality and Immortality," Radishchev gave a generally materialist explanation of natural phenomena and the origin of life (including humans), and expressed doubt about the idealist doctrine of the immortality of the soul. Radishchev also put forward many bold and original views on the issue of social development. However, Radishchev's view of social development was still idealist, because he regarded reason, education, and thought as the main driving forces of society.
    In his article "On the National Pride of the Great Russians," Lenin gave a high evaluation to Radishchev's revolutionary achievements, listing Radishchev as an outstanding representative of revolutionary Russia, which constitutes national pride. The Soviet people cherish the memory of the first announcer of Russian anti-serfdom revolutionary thought with reverence and vigorously disseminate his ideological heritage.
    In the Soviet Union, the progressive aspects of the past philosophical heritage are highly valued, and philosophical selections of Lomonosov, Radishchev, and Enlightenment scholars of the second half of the 18th century have been published in large quantities. The complete works of Radishchev have been published, the publication of the complete works of Lomonosov is coming to an end, and the complete works of the Enlightenment scholar Novikov are also being published. Many treatises have been written on the philosophical and socio-political views of Lomonosov, Radishchev, and Enlightenment scholars of the 18th century, many books and pamphlets have been published, and many papers have been published in scientific journals and other publications.
    For almost an entire century, landlord and bourgeois historians had obliterated and deliberately distorted the ideological heritage of the aristocratic revolutionaries, that is, the Decembrists who launched an uprising against the Tsarist system in 1825.
    Lenin pointed out the limitations of the Decembrists in being far from the people and fearing the active participation of the masses in the revolutionary movement, while giving a high evaluation to their ideas of opposing serfdom and advocating a republican system, believing that the Decembrists' uprising against the autocratic system awakened the revolutionary democrats. Many of the Decembrists' works are full of profound materialist ideas, which opposed the religious mystical ideological system of the serf owners, opposed church doctrines, and opposed idealism.
    The Soviet Union has published the Decembrists' works in large quantities and has written many treatises on the Decembrists' ideological heritage.
    In the 1840s, the ideology of revolutionary democracy emerged in Russia, and its founders were Belinsky, Herzen, and Ogarev. Chernyshevsky, Dobrolyubov, Pisarev, Shelgunov, Antonovich, the Serno-Solovyevich brothers, and others further developed the ideas of revolutionary democracy. Outstanding writers such as Nekrasov, Saltykov-Shchedrin, and Taras Shevchenko also belonged to the democratic camp.
    The ideas of the revolutionary democrats were produced during a period of acute crisis of the serf system in Russia and grew out of the liberation struggle of serfs and other working classes against the feudal serf system.
    The revolutionary democrats' activities on the social stage were highly praised by Marx and Engels, and later by Lenin and his students and comrades-in-arms. Lenin believed that the revolutionary democrats were the direct predecessors of the Russian Social Democrats and the forerunners of Russian Marxism.
    Lenin comprehensively evaluated the ideological heritage of the Russian revolutionary democrats in his works "What Heritage Do We Renounce?", "What are the 'Friends of the People' and How Do They Attack the Social Democrats?", "On 'Landmarks'", "In Memory of Herzen", "'The Peasant Reform' and the Proletarian Peasant Revolution", "The Role of Estates and Classes in the Liberation Movement", "On the Worker Press of the Russian Past", and "On the National Pride of the Great Russians". He defended these ideological heritages by countering the distortions, obliterations, or complete denials of their outstanding role in the development of advanced socio-political and philosophical thought by landlord-bourgeois historians and Populist Social Revolutionary historians.
    The Soviet people are proud of the revolutionary democrats' social activities and creative activities full of the spirit of class struggle. The revolutionary democrats' works are considered to be a revolutionary attitude towards reality and the ideas of utopian socialism. Lenin called the revolutionary democrats' socialism peasant utopian socialism. This socialism expressed the oppressed peasants' demand to eliminate landlord land ownership and all old regimes, and expressed the demand to equally divide the land. These demands were revolutionary at the time, and they awakened new forces to fight against autocracy and serfdom. The historical significance of the Russian revolutionary democrats' creation and struggle lies in this.
    In the revolutionary democrats' ideological heritage, philosophical doctrine occupies an extremely important position. Their philosophical doctrine has the nature of militant materialism and atheism, is full of the spirit of progress and a spirit of absolute irreconcilability to all kinds of idealism, spiritualism, mysticism, and agnosticism.
    The revolutionary democrats attached great importance to Hegel's dialectical method, and they studied Hegel's dialectics and the philosophical materialism of English and French materialists and Feuerbach. At the same time, they were thinkers with complete independence and originality, and they pointed out and criticized the weaknesses of past metaphysical materialism. What is particularly important is that they resolutely rejected the agnosticism of Kant and his followers, the mysticism of Schelling, and the conservative system and idealism of Hegel.
    The Soviet people are proud that the revolutionary democrats, especially Chernyshevsky, stood on the position of complete philosophical materialism and were even one step higher than the materialism before Marx. They declared that philosophy and natural science, theory and practice must be closely combined, and that practice is the cornerstone of all theories and the great revealer of all self-deception and illusions.
    The revolutionary democrats' philosophical materialism, atheism, and dialectics represented a great step forward compared to all philosophy before Marxism, and they were a great achievement of world philosophical thought. Lenin pointed out when talking about Herzen that Herzen had already come close to dialectical materialism and stood still in front of historical materialism. This comment can also be applied to Belinsky, Chernyshevsky, Dobrolyubov, Pisarev, and Shelgunov, who had greatly surpassed Herzen in the formulation and solution of many philosophical problems, not to mention political problems. The revolutionary democrats did not draw reformist conclusions from dialectics, but revolutionary conclusions, and they interpreted dialectics as "revolutionary algebra," and they used dialectics to serve the people's revolutionary struggle.
    The great Russian revolutionary thinkers made many profound guesses about social development. First of all, it must be pointed out that they acknowledged the "material factors" and "material needs," and in their view, "material factors" and "material needs" played almost the primary role in social development. They placed the role of the masses of the people, class struggle, and advanced theory and advanced art in an important position in social development. Although the revolutionary democrats had not yet recognized the decisive role of the mode of production, and did not understand the role of the proletariat in bourgeois society, they put forward principles related to social development and famous ideas of social historical progress. This was a significant contribution to Russian sociological theory before Marxism. In the Soviet Union, the beneficial patriotic ideas that the revolutionary democrats successfully and enthusiastically developed have been highly praised.
    The revolutionary democrats also made equally great contributions in formulating aesthetic theories, ruthlessly tearing apart the masks of the propagandists of "pure art" idealist theory. When the revolutionary democrats pointed out and criticized the reactionary, anti-social, and idealist nature of the "pure art" theory, they studied and demonstrated the realistic principles of art, the social role and popular nature of art, and the high ideological and truthfulness of art.
    The ideas they put forward in art had great significance for the further development of Russian literature and foreign literature. These ideas have not lost their importance even today. Marxist-Leninist philosophy, Soviet literature and art have inherited everything excellent created by the revolutionary democrats in developing philosophical, sociological, and aesthetic ideas.
    In the Soviet Union, the revolutionary democrats' ideological heritage is greatly cherished. Philosophers, historians, literary scholars, economists, jurists, and literary critics are all carefully studying these ideological heritages. Many scientific works (monographs, pamphlets, papers) have been written on the revolutionary democrats' ideological heritages. The Soviet Union has published the complete works of Belinsky, Herzen, Chernyshevsky, Dobrolyubov, Pisarev, Ogarev, and other revolutionary democrats in large quantities, and has separately published the philosophical selections of Belinsky, Herzen, Ogarev, Chernyshevsky, Dobrolyubov, Pisarev, and Antonovich.
    In the Soviet Union, great attention is paid to the study and elucidation of the history of philosophical thought of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union (Ukrainian, Belarusian, Georgian, Azerbaijani, Armenian, and other nationalities). In recent years, "An Outline of the History of Philosophical Thought and Socio-Political Thought of the Various Nationalities of the Soviet Union" has been published, in two volumes. In the national republics, the study of the history of philosophical thought of these republics is also being intensified, and the works of various thinkers are being published, and various scientific treatises are being written.
    Not long ago, the philosophical selections of the Ukrainian revolutionary democrat, the Armenian thinker Nalbandian, and the Azerbaijani philosopher Akhundov were published, and the works of other writers are also being prepared for publication.
    As for the reactionary idealist and religious mystical systems of the 18th-19th and early 20th centuries, they are resolutely rejected in the Soviet Union because their ideological content is anti-science, anti-materialism and atheism, and anti-liberation struggle.
    In the Soviet Union, the philosophical heritage of other nationalities is also highly valued. In the philosophy departments of universities, courses in the history of domestic philosophy and the history of foreign philosophy are offered, lectures are organized, and classroom discussions and thematic lectures are held. Popular lectures are also organized for the working people. All important works of ancient and modern thinkers, even those that are slightly important, have been translated into Russian and published in the Soviet Union.

                    ＊　＊　＊ 
    Marxism-Leninism is the true protector and heir of all the ideological wealth (including philosophical wealth) created by advanced thinkers of the past.
    However, as Lenin pointed out, being the protector of the ideological heritage does not mean being an archivist. It also does not mean that the protector of the ideological heritage should memorize and dogmatically repeat these heritages. A formalistic, dogmatic, and pedantic attitude towards the philosophical heritage of the past is incompatible with Soviet science.
    Critically and creatively treating the philosophical heritage of the past, reconsidering these heritages from the standpoint of the revolutionary working class and from the current state of scientific knowledge, is a characteristic of Soviet social science.
    A critical and creative attitude towards the philosophical heritage obliges us to neither fall into nihilism, negating these heritages indiscriminately, nor overestimating these heritages. When Soviet scholars talk about the powerful and positive aspects of the philosophical heritage of the past, they do not conceal their weaknesses and social limitations.
    Guided by Marxist-Leninist doctrine, the Soviet people strive to understand the characteristics of this or that philosophical system, to understand their powerful and weak aspects, and to use the great achievements of advanced human thought to build a new communist society.

    苏联人民对待本国哲学遗产的态度
    苏联　施帕诺夫教授
      以马克思列宁主义的不朽思想培养出来的苏联人民恰如其分的很高地评价了俄国文化和世界文化的真正成就。
      苏联学者具体地历史地去评价这些或那些过去的哲学思想、学派和思潮，同时力求判定，它们究竟为哪些社会力量服务，它们保护哪些阶级的利益，它们是促进了社会的进步还是阻碍了进步。不言而喻，对那些促进了社会进步的思想和学派的评价同对那些妨碍或抗拒社会进步的思想和学派的评价不会是一样的。
    苏联学者以这种观点对待过去的哲学遗产，做了不少工作并胜利地进行了反对歪曲和伪造哲学史特别是本国哲学史的斗争。
    大家知道，在苏维埃以前的俄国，在俄国社会思想史和哲学史方面的专制教权派的、地主的、资产阶级的和小资产阶级的历史学家，花费了很大力量去歪曲俄国的整个历史进程，其中也包括俄国哲学史。他们百般颂扬反动的宗教神秘主义的学派和思潮，证明这些学派和思潮的代表宣扬的思想似乎是符合俄罗斯人民的民族性格的。同时他们无保留地否定了哲学中的党性原则，忽视了唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争，鼓吹诸如此类的反动思想：哲学是超党派的，哲学对政治斗争和出现在社会生活中的政党应采取漠不关心的态度，哲学结论必须和新旧约全书的教义相合，等等。
    其次，这些反马克思主义的历史学家诬蔑伟大的俄国人民，说他们似乎是笃信宗教的人民，绝对矢忠于正教教会、沙皇和一切最高政权的人民，是除了领受沙皇政权和牧师恩赐的东西之外不图谋任何社会变革的人民。因此，他们企图把十九世纪中叶的斯拉夫主义者的宗教神秘主义学说以及宗教唯心主义哲学说成是“俄罗斯人民”、“俄罗斯精神”、“俄罗斯世界观”所特有的真正俄罗斯哲学。并且，统治阶级的历史学家们对俄国哲学和外国哲学中的一切先进的唯物主义和无神论思潮表现出敌视的态度，卑视俄国唯物主义者的独立性和独创性。
    立宪民主党人在他们于1909年出版的臭名远扬的“路标”文集（列宁把它叫做“自由主义叛卖思想大全”）中，以强烈的憎恨和毫不掩饰的敌意攻击了俄国的唯物主义哲学和先进的社会政治思想。现代的白俄历史学家和资产阶级历史学家写了不少俄国哲学史方面的书，他们现在热心地重述“路标派”的诬蔑性的思想。只要指出司祭长费洛罗夫斯基的“俄国神学的道路”（1937）、别尔加耶夫的“俄国思想”（1945）、雅柯温柯的“俄国哲学史”（1939）、司祭长杰柯夫斯基的“俄国哲学史”（1948——1950）、洛斯基的“俄国哲学史”（1951）等等，就足以证明这一点。这些书的作者关心的不是客观地阐明社会历史进程的发展（包括俄国哲学思想的发展在内），而是怎样更狡猾地、更巧妙地使它适合杜撰的公式，这些公式贯串了教权派——保皇派的或地主资产阶级的党性的精神。他们在口头上每天否认这种党性，而在实际上不断贯彻这种党性。
    苏联学者以马克思列宁主义的唯物主义理论和辩证方法为指南，保卫过去几世纪的俄国进步思想家所创造的一切有价值的东西，使它们不遭受歪曲、庸俗化和贬低。
    当然，马克思列宁主义学说远远地超越了过去进步思想家在当时先进的政治思想、哲学思想、社会学思想、美学思想及其他的思想。但是，这种超越不是像当时所谓“无产阶级文化派”所企图做的那种胡乱的否定，而是根据马克思主义世界观对它们进行彻底的批判的改造，使它们有利于无产阶级和其他劳动阶层。因此，苏联人民并没有把过去哲学遗产的优秀部分一脚踢开，而是站在马克思列宁主义的立场上加以重新考虑和批判的接受。
    苏联马克思主义者认为，古代封建时代的那些社会政治思想和哲学思想派别只要是促进了各据一方的小公国联合为一个统一的强大的中央集权国家，即能够保卫自己独立、坚决反击国内外破坏联合的敌人的国家，它们对当时来说是有进步历史作用的。苏联人民对于伊拉里昂的“论法律和神恩”一书（1037——1050）以及“往年的故事”（11——14世纪）、“论伊果尔军团”（12世纪）等等作品，作了正确的评价。这些作品各自表达了当时已经成熟的社会历史的要求，贯串了对当时说来是先进的社会思想。
    在这个时期以及在稍后的时期中，民间的口头创作占着特殊的地位，这些作品包含有自发唯物主义的倾向和酷爱自由的民主倾向。民间创作，如谚语、俗语、民间故事、民歌、预测和传说等，概括了许多世纪来人民的生活经验、社会上形成过的氏族关系和阶级关系以及对自然现象的观察。
    在15——17世纪期间，俄国进步势力为建立和巩固以莫斯科为首的中央集权的俄罗斯国家而进行斗争，反动势力对此表示反抗。当时俄罗斯的先进思想家因祖国的命运而感到激动。他们虽然不懂得社会发展的真正动力是在社会的物质生活条件中，但企图理解历史的进步，真诚地想促进强大的中央集权国家的建立。他们的历史功绩和作用其实也就在这里。
    波索施柯夫、费奥芬·普罗柯波维奇、塔吉舍夫以及后来的康捷米尔写的经济学、哲学、社会学、伦理学的著作都是为了从理论上论证18世纪初俄国的彼得大帝改革。塔吉舍夫、普罗柯波维奇、康捷米尔的哲学著作都浸透着二元论。这些思想家都是支持彼得大帝改革的贵族思想家，他们援引“自然法和社会公约”的理论，主张“开明专制制度”。在对宇宙的看法上，普罗柯波维奇、塔吉舍夫、康捷米尔坚持世界是不可分的和世界在数量上是无穷的观点。他们十分重视哥白尼、伽利略、培根、霍布斯、笛卡儿和洛克的学说。
    罗蒙诺索夫（1711——1765）在俄国和世界文化的发展上起了杰出的作用。这位学者和思想家的功绩在于：他在俄国的哲学和自然科学方面开创了牢固的唯物主义的传统，科学地论证了唯物主义的物质构造的原子分子说、气体运动论、热的唯动说，竭力反对热素说，认为它是神秘主义学说。
    罗蒙诺索夫不仅否弃了第一推动力，宣布运动中的物质是永恒的，而且在1748年用实验科学地论证了物质和运动的守恒性。同时，他还提出了岩石、土壤、煤和石油的进化、发生的思想。同教会学说相反，他认为在其他行星上生命是可能存在的，同时他热烈拥护太阳中心说，认为宇宙是无限的，宇宙中有无数的世界。这位伟大的俄国思想家要求科学脱离宗教而独立发展，宗教不去干涉科学工作；要求科学依靠事实、观察和实验，哲学和科学携起手来，理论同实践结合起来。
    同时，罗蒙诺索夫热烈地提倡教育、提倡培养本国的干部和发展工业、农业、商业和航海业。他是莫斯科大学的创办人。罗蒙诺索夫的哲学和自然科学的遗产只有在苏维埃时代才得到足够的重视。同时，苏联人自然也不会忘记罗蒙诺索夫的哲学遗产的阶级局限性和科学局限性，不会忘记他对物质构造和物质表现的性质的看法主要是带有机械论性质的。
    18世纪后半叶，在俄国产生了强大的启蒙学派，其主要代表是波波夫斯基、诺维柯夫、阿尼奇柯夫、捷斯尼茨基、柯泽尔斯基等人，他们为贵族革命家的发动准备了思想基础。
    启蒙学派的思想按其实质来说是反封建的，而按其性质来说是资产阶级的。启蒙学派批判了俄国农奴制的个别方面；提倡教育和人道主义；斥责农奴主的愚昧无知，饱食终日，无所事事；斥责官吏和法官的贪污受贿，力图拯救农奴的命运，主张发展社会的物质力量和精神力量。启蒙学派中某些人，如阿尼奇柯夫、柯泽尔斯基、巴图林、斯洛夫佐夫在某种形式下发展了对自然界及其现象、人类知识的起源和性质的唯物主义观点。虽然他们的唯物主义带有机械论性质，但在当时起了进步作用，打击了宗教神秘主义的和唯心主义的学说，开导人们相信理性、科学和教育。
    18世纪末期，拉吉舍夫在俄国出版了他的有名的革命著作：“从彼得堡到莫斯科旅行记”。他在书中对国内的专制制度和封建农奴制度进行了致命的批判。专制制度残酷地迫害拉吉舍夫，判处他死刑，后改为流放。苏联人为拉吉舍夫而感到骄傲，并且给予崇高的评价，首先因为他为俄国先进社会思想的革命传统奠定了基础。
    拉吉舍夫在其“论人、人的死和不死”这部哲学著作中对自然现象以及生命（包括人）的起源问题作了总的说来是唯物主义的解释，对灵魂不死的唯心主义学说表示了怀疑。拉吉舍夫对于社会发展问题也提出了许多大胆的独创性的见解。但是，拉吉舍夫的社会发展观还是唯心主义的，因为他把理性、教育、思想看成是社会的主要推动力。
    列宁在“论大俄罗斯人的民族自豪感”一文中给拉吉舍夫的革命功绩以崇高的评价，把拉吉舍夫列为构成民族自豪感的革命俄国的优秀代表。苏联人民怀着敬仰的心情悼念着这位俄国反农奴制革命思想的第一个宣布者，大力传播他的思想遗产。
    在苏联，人们非常珍惜以往哲学遗产的进步方面，大量出版了罗蒙诺索夫、拉吉舍夫以及18世纪后半叶的启蒙学者的哲学选集。拉吉舍夫全集已经出版，罗蒙诺索夫全集的出版工作正在结束，启蒙学者诺维柯夫的全集也在出版。有关罗蒙诺索夫、拉吉舍夫以及18世纪的启蒙学者的哲学和社会政治观点，曾写了不少论著，出版了许多书籍和小册子，在科学杂志和其他刊物上发表了许多论文。
    几乎在整整一个世纪中，地主资产阶级的历史学家曾抹杀并故意歪曲贵族革命家、即在1825年举行反沙皇制度暴动的十二月党人的思想遗产。
    列宁指出了十二月党人远离人民、害怕人民群众积极参加革命运动的这种局限性，同时给他们的反对农奴制度、提倡共和政体的思想以崇高的评价，认为十二月党人反对专制制度的发动唤醒了革命民主主义者。十二月党人的许多著作充满了深刻的唯物主义思想，这些思想反对农奴主的宗教神秘主义思想体系，反对教会学说，反对唯心主义。
    苏联大量出版了十二月党人的著作，写了许多有关十二月党人思想遗产的论著。
    19世纪40年代，在俄国产生了革命民主主义的思想，它的创始人是别林斯基、赫尔岑和奥格辽夫。车尔尼雪夫斯基、杜勃罗留波夫、皮萨列夫、舍尔古诺夫、安东诺维奇、塞尔诺—索洛维也维奇兄弟和其他人进一步发展了革命民主主义思想。涅克拉索夫、萨尔梯柯夫—谢德林、塔拉斯·舍夫琴柯等优秀作家也属于民主主义的阵营。
    革命民主主义者的思想是在俄国农奴制度遭受尖锐危机的时期产生的，是在农奴和其他劳动阶层反对封建农奴制度的解放斗争中成长起来的。
    革命民主主义者在社会舞台上的活动得到了马克思和恩格斯的崇高评价，后来又得到了列宁及其学生和战友们的崇高评价。列宁认为，革命民主主义者是俄国社会民主党的直接的前辈，是俄国马克思主义的先驱。
      列宁在“我们究竟拒绝什么遗产？”、“什么是‘人民之友’以及他们如何攻击社会民主主义者？”、“论‘路标派’”、“纪念赫尔岑”、“‘农民改革’和无产阶级农民革命”、“解放运动中各等级和各阶级的作用”、“论俄国过去的工人报刊”、“论大俄罗斯人的民族自豪感”等著作中对俄国革命民主主义者的思想遗产作了全面的估价。地主资产阶级的历史学家和民粹派社会革命党人的历史学家歪曲、抹杀或完全否定这些思想遗产在先进社会政治思想和哲学思想的发展中的杰出作用，列宁给予了反击，从而保卫了这些思想遗产。
    苏联人民因革命民主主义者的社会活动和充满着阶级斗争气息的创作活动而感到骄傲。革命民主主义者的作品被认为就是对待现实的革命态度和空想社会主义的思想。列宁把革命民主主义者的社会主义称为农民的、空想的社会主义。这种社会主义表达了被压迫农民想消灭地主土地占有制和一切旧政权的要求，表达了平分土地的要求。这些要求在当时是有革命意义的，它们唤起新生的力量去同专制制度和农奴制度作斗争。俄国革命民主主义者的创作和斗争的历史意义也就在于此。
    在革命民主主义者的思想遗产中，哲学学说占着极重要的地位。他们的哲学学说带有战斗唯物主义的和无神论的性质，充满着前进的精神以及对形形色色唯心主义、降神术、神秘主义和不可知论决不调和的精神。
    革命民主主义者非常重视黑格尔的辩证方法，他们学习黑格尔的辩证法以及英法唯物主义者和费尔巴哈的哲学唯物主义。同时，他们是完全具有独立性和独创性的思想家，他们指出并批判了以往形而上学唯物主义的弱点，特别重要的是他们坚决地摒弃康德及其信徒的不可知论、谢林的神秘主义、黑格尔的保守体系和他的唯心主义。
    苏联人民引为骄傲的是：革命民主主义者，特别是车尔尼雪夫斯基，站到了完整的哲学唯物主义的立场上，而且还比马克思以前的唯物主义高出一头。他们宣布：哲学同自然科学，理论同实践必须紧密地结合起来，实践是一切理论的奠基石，是一切自我欺骗和幻想的伟大揭破者。
    革命民主主义者的哲学唯物主义、无神论和辩证法同马克思主义以前的一切哲学比较起来，已经大大地向前迈进了一步，它们是世界哲学思想的巨大成就。列宁在讲到赫尔岑时指出，赫尔岑已经走到辩证唯物主义跟前，而在历史唯物主义面前站住了。这个评语也能同样适用于别林斯基、车尔尼雪夫斯基、杜布罗留波夫、皮萨列夫、舍尔古诺夫，他们在许多哲学问题的提出和解决上已经大大地超过了赫尔岑，至于在政治问题上更不用说了。革命民主主义者从辩证法中没有作出改良主义的结论，而是做出了革命的结论，他们把辩证法解释成“革命的代数学”，他们用辩证法来为人民革命斗争服务。
    伟大的俄国革命思想家对社会发展作出了许多深刻的猜测。首先必须指出的是，他们承认“物质因素”、“物质需要”，在他们看来，“物质因素”、“物质需要”在社会发展中几乎起着头等作用。他们把人民群众的作用、阶级斗争以及先进理论和先进艺术放在社会发展的重要地位上。虽然革命民主主义者还没有承认生产方式的决定性作用，还不懂得无产阶级在资产阶级社会中的作用，但他们提出了有关社会发展的原理以及社会历史进步的著名思想，这是对马克思主义以前的俄国社会学理论的重大贡献。在苏联，革命民主主义者所成功地热烈地发挥的那些有益的爱国主义思想得到了崇高的评价。
    革命民主主义者在制定美学理论方面也作出了同样巨大的贡献，他们无情地撕破了“纯艺术”唯心主义理论的宣传者的假面具。革命民主主义者在指出和批判“纯艺术”理论的反动的、反社会的、唯心主义的性质时，研究并论证了艺术的现实主义原则、艺术的社会作用和人民性、艺术的高度思想性和真实性。
    他们在艺术方面提出的思想对于俄国文学和国外文学的进一步发展具有重大的意义。这些思想就是在今天也还没有失去其重要意义。马克思列宁主义哲学、苏维埃文学和艺术继承了革命民主主义者在发展哲学、社会学和美学思想时所创造的一切优秀的东西。
    在苏联，革命民主主义者的思想遗产受到极大的爱护。哲学家、历史学家、文艺学家、经济学家、法学家以及文艺批评家都在仔细地研究这些思想遗产。有关革命民主主义者的思想遗产，曾写了许多科学著作（专论、小册子、论文）。苏联大量出版了别林斯基、赫尔岑、车尔尼雪夫斯基、杜勃罗留波夫、皮萨列夫、奥格辽夫以及其他革命民主主义者的全集，单独出版了别林斯基、赫尔岑、奥格辽夫、车尔尼雪夫斯基、杜勃罗留波夫、皮萨列夫、安东诺维奇的哲学选集。
    在苏联，人们非常注意研究和阐明苏联各民族（乌克兰、白俄罗斯、格鲁吉亚、阿捷尔拜疆、阿尔明尼亚和其他民族）的哲学思想史。近年来出版了“苏联各民族的哲学思想和社会政治思想史概论”，共两卷。在各民族共和国中也正加紧研究这些共和国的哲学思想史，出版各思想家的著作，写各种科学论著。
    不久以前出版了乌克兰革命民主主义者、阿尔明尼亚思想家纳尔拜疆以及阿捷尔拜疆哲学家阿洪多夫的哲学选集，其他著作家的作品也在准备出版。
    至于18——19世纪和20世纪初的反动的唯心主义和宗教神秘主义的体系，则在苏联遭到坚决的否定，因为它们的思想内容是反对科学、反对唯物主义和无神论、反对解放斗争的。
    在苏联，其他民族的哲学遗产也很受重视。在各大学的哲学系中都开了本国哲学史和外国哲学史的课程，组织讲课，举行课堂讨论和专题讲座。给劳动人民还组织通俗讲座。古代和现代思想家的一切重要著作，即便是稍为重要的著作，都已经译成俄文，在苏联出版。
                    ＊　＊　＊ 
    马克思列宁主义是以往人类先进思想家所创造的一切思想财富（包括哲学财富）的真正的保护者和继承者。
    但是，像列宁所指出的，当思想遗产的保护者并不意味着当档案保管人。这也并不意味着思想遗产的保护者应当把这些遗产死背熟读和教条主义地重复。对待以往哲学遗产的形式主义的、教条主义的、书呆子的态度是同苏维埃科学水火不相容的。
    批判地创造性地对待以往的哲学遗产，从革命工人阶级的立场、从科学知识的现状去重新考虑这些遗产，这是苏维埃社会科学的特点。
    对待哲学遗产的批判的创造性的态度，责成我们既不能陷入虚无主义，把这些遗产不分青红皂白地加以否定，也不能把这些遗产估价过高。苏联学者在谈到以往哲学遗产的有力的肯定的方面时，并不掩盖它们的弱点和社会局限性。
    苏联人民以马克思列宁主义学说为指南，力图了解这种或那种哲学体系的特点，了解它们的有力的和薄弱的方面，利用人类先进思想的伟大成果去建设新的共产主义的社会。
