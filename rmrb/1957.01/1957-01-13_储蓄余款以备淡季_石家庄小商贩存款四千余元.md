Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, January 5th: Small vendors in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, are depositing their surplus money in banks to prepare for the off-season. Currently, 181 small vendors in the city have saved a total of 4,798 yuan in banks.

With the help and arrangements of relevant government departments, the current income of small vendors in Shijiazhuang can basically guarantee their living needs. Some small vendors in certain industries have not only solved their living difficulties but also have surpluses after repaying loans and replenishing their operating funds. The Municipal Bureau of Commerce anticipates that the operating income of small vendors may decrease after the off-season arrives and has therefore called on them to deposit their surplus money in banks. Currently, many small vendors in various industries are adopting various methods of saving. Small vendors in the beef and mutton industry are conducting collective current deposits in the name of groups based on voluntary principles. Small vendors in the hemp knife and used clothing industries, anticipating the off-season in three months, are adopting individual fixed deposit methods, with deposit periods generally ranging from three to four months.

    储蓄余款以备淡季
    石家庄小商贩存款四千余元
    新华社保定5日电　河北省石家庄市的小商小贩把余钱存入银行，以备淡季需要。目前全市有一百八十一户小商小贩在银行储蓄了四千七百九十八元。
    石家庄市的小商小贩，经过政府有关部门的帮助和安排，现在的收入基本上能保证生活需要。有些行业的小商小贩不仅解决了生活上的困难，而且除了归还贷款和补充经营资金以外，还有富裕。市商业局估计到淡季来临以后，小商小贩的营业收入可能减少，因此号召他们把余钱存入银行。目前已经有不少行业的小商小贩采用多种方式储蓄。牛羊肉业的小商贩根据自愿原则，以小组名义进行集体活期存款。麻刀、估衣两个行业的小商贩，估计到三个月后将进入淡季，采取个人定期存款办法储蓄，一般存期是三个月到四个月。
