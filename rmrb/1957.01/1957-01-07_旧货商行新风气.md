    New Atmosphere in Secondhand Stores
    In September 1956, a customer sold a telescope to the Beijing Yanshou Commercial Firm, asking for 70 yuan. The service personnel of this firm examined it and felt that the quality of the telescope was good, but the triangular prism inside was damaged. They discussed it with the customer, kept the telescope, and asked someone from the firm to repair it before pricing it. After the repair, the customer actually received 100 yuan. This customer said, "Before the joint venture, I had brought this telescope to the secondhand store to sell it; at that time, it was not worth even 50 yuan, and I was not willing to sell it. It has only been a year, what a big change!"
    Comrade Song Hui, a staff member of a state organ, needed to sell luggage, furniture, and other items that were inconvenient to carry because he was being transferred to work in another location. At that time, they were priced at 150 yuan and sold to the Zhongchang Commercial Firm. The firm actually sold them for 216 yuan and took the initiative to give Comrade Song Hui an additional 30 yuan. Similar examples of supplementary payments for higher sales prices and fair buying and selling frequently occur in other secondhand stores in Beijing.
    Their new business style and spirit of sincerely serving customers have also begun to establish credibility in many other places. In one month, the Zhongchang Commercial Firm received sixty letters from customers in other places expressing their gratitude.
    This new style has caused the business volume of secondhand consignment sales in Beijing to rise month by month. Taking the business volume in September 1956 as 100, it increased to 113 in October and 130 in November. Compared with the same three months of the previous year, the business volume has more than doubled.

    旧货商行新风气
    1956年9月，有一位顾客在北京延年商行出售一架望远镜，要价七十元。这个商行的服务人员验看以后，觉得望远镜的质量还不错，只是其中的三角镜坏了。他们就同顾客商量，把望远镜留下，由商行找人修理后再定价。经过修理后，这位顾客实际得价一百元。这位顾客说：“在合营以前，我曾把这架望远镜拿到旧货商行卖过；那时候还不值五十元，我没有舍得卖。事情只隔一年，变化多大呀！”
    国家机关工作人员宋惠同志，因调往外地工作，需要把不便携带的行李、家具等物品卖掉。当时就作价一百五十元卖给了中昌商行。这个商行实际卖了二百十六元，就主动给宋惠同志增加了三十元。类似的多卖补款、收售公平的事迹，在北京其它旧货商行也经常出现。
    他们的新的经营作风和诚恳为顾客服务的精神，也在别的许多地方开始建立了信誉。中昌商行在一个月里就收到了外地顾客表示感谢的来信六十封。
    这种新作风使北京市旧货委托业的经营额月月上升。以1956年9月份营业额为一百，10月份增加为一百一十三，11月份增加为一百三十。以这三个月同前年同期相比，营业额增加了一倍以上。
