　　Eating Fresh Peaches in Deep Winter
　　A type of fresh peach, recently ripened and with a red, sweet, and crisp flesh, is now on the market in the Shaanxi region. This peach is produced in Shang County, Lueyang, Weinan, Mei County, and other places in Shaanxi Province. Its shape resembles an egg, and the largest can weigh up to six taels (300 grams).

　　The characteristic of this peach is that it is suitable for growing in the cold season. Its flowering time is the same as that of ordinary peach trees, but after flowering, when the peaches grow to the size of a finger, they stop growing. At this time, the color is greenish, and the fuzz is very long and dense. Only after the “Frost’s Descent” solar term of that year does the fuzz fall off, and the peach immediately begins to grow again, growing very quickly. After several frosts, the leaves on the peach tree fall off, but the peaches are still growing on the tree, ripening only in the twelfth lunar month. Therefore, local farmers call this peach the "Twelfth Lunar Month Peach."

### 深冬季节吃鲜桃

    深冬季节吃鲜桃
    最近才成熟的一种颜色红艳又甜又脆的鲜桃已在陕西地区上市。这种桃子产在陕西省的商县、略阳、渭南、郿县等地。它的形状好像鸡蛋，最大的有六两重。
    这种桃子的特点是适宜于在寒冷的季节生长。它开花的时间和一般桃树开花的时间一样，但是开花以后，等桃结得有指头那么大的时候就不长了。这时颜色青绿，毛茸很多很长，一直到当年“霜降”以后，桃毛才脱去，桃又马上开始长，长的也很快。经过几次霜后，桃树上的叶子掉完了，而桃还在树上结着，直到农历十二月才熟，因此，当地农民称这种桃子叫“腊月桃”。　（新华社）
