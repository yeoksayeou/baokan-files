    The Fierce Attack of the United States on the People of the Middle East

    The United States has recently been clamoring that it will promote a plan called the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Middle East. This plan, under the smokescreen of "preventing Soviet threats," on the one hand, clamors for the use of force in the Middle East, giving Eisenhower the right to use American armed forces in the Middle East at any time; on the other hand, it stipulates a two-year economic aid plan of more than 400 million US dollars to provide so-called "aid" to Middle Eastern countries. To put it bluntly, the United States wants to use the two knives of threat and inducement to carve up the Middle Eastern countries that are striving for and maintaining national independence and freedom. Therefore, the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" is just an extremely greedy and fierce colonialist aggression plan.

    This aggression plan is actually nothing new. Anyone who is slightly familiar with the history of American foreign aggression knows that the United States had the so-called "Monroe Doctrine" in 1823 and the so-called "Truman Doctrine" in 1947, which were nothing more than naked colonialist acts of foreign expansion and aggression by the United States. The United States promoted the "Monroe Doctrine" to seize the entire Central and South America, enslaving and exploiting the people of these countries. The United States promoted the "Truman Doctrine" to extend its aggressive forces into Greece and Turkey, controlling these two countries politically, economically, and militarily. The so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" is just a replica of the "Monroe Doctrine" and the "Truman Doctrine," and is also an ambitious aggression plan.

    The purpose of this aggression plan by the United States is to place "any Middle Eastern country from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Arabian Sea" under the control of the United States, suppress the national independence movements of these countries, and turn them into American colonies and military bases. Dulles said in his year-end message a few days ago that the Middle East is "extremely important" to the United States because it has abundant resources and transportation routes. Senior US government officials also revealed on December 29 last year that in order to achieve this aggressive purpose, Eisenhower believed that, if necessary, "the Middle East is worth fighting for." This clearly exposes the aggressive nature of the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine." It fundamentally negates the independent sovereignty of Middle Eastern countries and is a fierce attack on the people of the Middle East.

    The United States said that the purpose of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is to "fill the power vacuum created in the Middle East by the disappearance of British and French influence after the attack on Suez with American military and economic power." This is a great insult and slander to the independent and autonomous people of Egypt and all the people of the Middle East. According to this absurd statement, it seems that the people of the Middle Eastern countries cannot have independent and autonomous rights at all, as if they are born to rely on Western colonial countries to survive. The people of the Middle Eastern countries have waged long-term struggles with Western colonial countries to strive for national independence and sovereignty. They drive away one colonialist, not to let another colonialist in, but to live a life free from oppression and exploitation. The failure of the British and French war of aggression against Egypt, and the disappearance of British and French aggressive forces and influence in the Middle East, is precisely a great victory for Egypt and the Middle Eastern Arab countries in striving for and maintaining national independence. American colonialism attempts to replace Britain and France and ride on the heads of the Egyptian people and the people of the Middle Eastern countries, to fill the so-called "vacuum" left by the British and French colonialists. This is nothing but an unattainable dream!

    The United States says that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is to use American power to "install a protective shield for the Middle East, which is threatened by communism." This is also not deceiving. Historical facts have proved that what threatens the Middle Eastern countries is not communism, but precisely Western colonialism. In the war of aggression launched by Britain and France against Egypt, the Soviet Union, China, and all peace-loving countries and people stood firmly on the side of the invaded Egyptian people and the people of the Middle Eastern countries, sympathizing with and supporting their struggle against aggression and to defend their independent sovereignty. However, the United States, which shamelessly claims to be a "shield" to "protect" the Middle East, actually stood on the side of the British and French aggressors, supporting the British and French attacks on Egypt and the Middle Eastern countries. Therefore, when the Soviet Union sent a note to the United States, asking it to jointly send troops to stop the British and French aggression and protect peace in the Middle East, the United States firmly refused. Now that the British and French war of aggression has been stopped, the United States has come out and clamored to use armed forces to "protect" the Middle East. Isn't this for its own aggressive purposes in the Middle East?

    Syrian Ambassador to the United States Zeineddine said it well: The reason for the tense situation in the Middle East is the colonialists and the Zionists supported by them; the American "statement that the Soviet Union is carrying out infiltration in the Middle East is not true, it is just an external phenomenon to cover up the real situation." People in Cairo also stated that the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" means armed intervention in the internal affairs of Arab countries. It is in conflict with President Nasser's independent and autonomous policy, and Egypt will fight against the "Eisenhower Doctrine," just as Egypt once fought against the Baghdad Pact.

    The wolf in grandma's clothing has now shown its teeth. The United States, which once disguised itself as a "friend" and "anti-colonialist" of the Middle Eastern people, is actually the most ferocious enemy and naked colonialist of the Middle Eastern people. In order to strive for and maintain the independence and freedom of the Middle Eastern countries, and in order to defend peace in the Middle East, it is necessary to resolutely oppose the aggressive "Eisenhower Doctrine," and it is necessary to wage an irreconcilable struggle against the American colonialists.

### 美国对中东人民的凶恶进攻

    美国对中东人民的凶恶进攻
    美国最近大肆喧嚷，它要在中东地区推行一个叫做什么“艾森豪威尔主义”的计划。这个计划挂着“防止苏联威胁”的烟幕，一面叫嚣要在中东使用武力，给艾森豪威尔以随时可以在中东地区使用美国武装部队的权利；一面规定一项四亿多美元的两年经济援助计划，对中东国家进行所谓“援助”。拆穿来说，美国就是想用威胁和利诱这两把刀子，来宰割争取和维护民族独立自由的中东国家。因此所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”，只是一个极端贪婪而凶恶的殖民主义侵略计划。
    这个侵略计划其实并不是什么新的东西。稍为熟悉美国对外侵略历史的人都会晓得，美国在1823年有过所谓“门罗主义”，在1947年有过所谓“杜鲁门主义”，都不过是美国赤裸裸地对外扩张侵略的殖民主义。美国推行“门罗主义”，是要攫取整个中南美洲，奴役和剥削这些国家的人民。美国推行“杜鲁门主义”，是要把它的侵略势力伸进希腊和土耳其，从政治、经济和军事上控制这两个国家。所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”，只是“门罗主义”和“杜鲁门主义”的翻版，同样是野心勃勃的侵略计划。
    美国这个侵略计划的目的，是要把“从直布罗陀海峡到阿拉伯海的任何中东国家”置于美国的控制之下，压制这些国家的民族独立运动，使它们变成美国的殖民地和军事基地。杜勒斯前几天发表的年终文告中就说，中东地区对美国是“极其重要的”，因为那里有着丰富的资源和交通航道。美国政府高级官员去年12月29日也透露，为了实现这个侵略目的，艾森豪威尔认为，如果必要的话，“中东是值得为之一战的”。这都清楚地暴露出所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”的侵略实质，它根本抹杀中东国家的独立主权，是对中东人民的凶恶进攻。
    美国说，“艾森豪威尔主义”的目的，是要“用美国的军事和经济力量，填满英法在进攻苏伊士以后由于影响的消逝而在中东造成的势力真空”，这对于独立自主的埃及人民和所有中东国家人民都是莫大的侮辱和诬蔑。按照这种荒谬的说法，好像中东国家人民根本不能有独立自主权利，好像他们天生要依靠西方殖民国家才能过活。中东国家人民为了争取民族独立和主权，曾同西方殖民国家进行过长期斗争。他们打跑一个殖民主义者，不是为了让另一个殖民主义者进来，而是要过不被压迫和剥削的生活。英法侵略埃及战争的失败，英法侵略势力和影响在中东的消逝，正是埃及和中东阿拉伯国家争取和维护民族独立的伟大胜利。美国殖义主义企图代替英、法骑在埃及人民和中东国家人民的头上，要填补英法殖民主义者所留下的所谓“真空”，这不过是不能实现的梦想！
    美国说，“艾森豪威尔主义”是要以美国的力量，“给受到共产主义威胁的中东安上一面保护的盾牌”，这同样是骗不了人的。历来的事实证明，威胁中东国家的不是共产主义，而恰恰是西方殖民主义。在英法对埃及发动的侵略战争中，苏联、中国以及一切爱好和平的国家和人民，都坚定地站在被侵略的埃及人民和中东国家人民方面，同情和支持他们反抗侵略、保卫独立主权的斗争。而大言不惭地声称要作为“保护”中东“盾牌”的美国，实际上却站在英法侵略者方面，支持英法对埃及和中东国家的进攻。因此，当苏联照会美国，要它共同出兵制止英法的侵略行动、保护中东和平的时候，美国表示坚决拒绝。现在，英法的侵略战争已制止，美国却出来叫嚷要使用武装部队“保护”中东，这不是为了它自己对中东的侵略目的又是什么呢？
    叙利亚驻美国大使宰尼丁说得好：造成中东的紧张局势的原因，是殖民主义者和为它们所支持的犹太复国主义者；美国“所谓苏联在中东进行渗透的说法是不真实的，它只是为了要掩饰真实情况的一种外表现象”。开罗人士也表示，所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”就是意味着武装干涉阿拉伯国家的内政，它同纳赛尔总统的独立自主政策相抵触，埃及将同“艾森豪威尔主义”作斗争，正像埃及曾经同巴格达条约作斗争一样。
    装作外婆的狼现在已经露出了牙齿。曾经把自己改扮成中东人民的“朋友”和“反殖民主义者”的美国，实际上恰恰是中东人民的最凶恶的敌人和赤裸裸的殖民主义者。为了争取和维护中东国家的独立和自由，为了保卫中东地区的和平，就需要坚决反对侵略性的“艾森豪威尔主义”，就需要同美国殖民主义者进行不调和的斗争。
