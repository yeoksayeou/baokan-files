Shaanxi Province's agricultural cooperatives are actively carrying out winter production campaigns. The Guanzhong Plain has not had rainfall for a long time, and wheat fields are showing signs of drought. Therefore, agricultural cooperatives are seizing the time to carry out winter irrigation work. Wugong County has now reached 80% of its winter irrigation area, and many cooperatives have proposed to complete all winter irrigation work on irrigable wheat fields before the Spring Festival. Other counties such as Lintong, Xianyang, Chang'an, Xingping, and Weinan have also exceeded their winter irrigation areas from previous years. For example, Chang'an County has a total of 540,000 mu of wheat fields this year, of which 350,000 mu can be irrigated. Currently, 90% of the wheat fields have completed winter irrigation. In the southern Shaanxi area, winter production is also better than in previous years.

Agricultural cooperatives in various places are seizing the time to carry out winter fertilization and winter hoeing. The winter fertilization area in Wugong, Lintong, Xianyang, and Luonan counties is all above 60%. Many agricultural cooperatives have already completed all topdressing work. The "May 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in Xianyang County has planted more than 6,400 mu of wheat, with an average of six large carts of fertilizer applied per mu (compared to an average of four large carts per mu last year). Shaanxi Province has less fertilizer this year, but agricultural cooperatives are trying every means to solve the fertilizer problem. Some are using the soil from demolished old-style heated brick beds and earthen walls as fertilizer, and some are using the past method of burning fertilizer to solve the fertilizer problem. (Note: The method of burning fertilizer is relatively simple and quick. The burning method is to first dig a cross-shaped deep ditch two chi deep and one chi wide according to the required amount of fertilizer. Use thick firewood or stone slabs to cover the ditch as a vent, and then spread a layer of firewood and grass about one chi four or five cun thick on top. Sprinkle a layer of topsoil on the firewood and grass, and then spread layers of firewood, grass, and soil. When you spread to two layers, light the fire. When the fire is strong, continue to spread firewood, grass, and soil. It will be successful in just four or five days.)

Last year, the area of wheat planted after a previous wheat crop in the Shaanxi area was about 6 million mu, with a yield of about 60% of that of wheat planted after a non-wheat crop. This year, the area of wheat planted after a previous wheat crop is even larger than last year. In order to strive for a good harvest of wheat planted after a previous wheat crop this year, agricultural cooperatives in various places have attached importance to the management of wheat planted after a previous wheat crop. Many agricultural cooperatives have applied topdressing fertilizer to wheat planted after a previous wheat crop and have generally carried out winter irrigation.

### 陕西许多地区冬季生产比往年做得好  冬灌面积增加，施肥和冬锄都抓得紧

    陕西许多地区冬季生产比往年做得好
    冬灌面积增加，施肥和冬锄都抓得紧
    本报讯　陕西省各县农业社积极开展冬季生产运动。关中平原久未降雨，麦田呈旱象，因此各农业社都抓紧进行冬灌工作。武功县目前冬灌面积已达到80％，很多社提出在春节前在有条件浇灌的麦田全部完成冬灌工作。其它如临潼、咸阳、长安、兴平、渭南等县的冬灌面积也都超过了往年。如长安县今年共有五十四万亩麦田，可浇灌的共三十五万亩，目前90％的麦田已经完成冬灌工作。陕南地区，冬季生产也比往年搞得好。
    各地农业社都抓紧冬季施肥和冬锄工作。武功、临潼、咸阳和雒南等县冬季施肥面积都在60％以上。有不少的农业社已全部完成施追肥的工作。咸阳县“五一”农业社，共种植六千四百多亩麦子，每亩平均施肥六大车（去年每亩平均四大车）。陕西省今年肥料较少，但农业社都想尽一切办法来解决肥料问题。有的把拆掉多年的土炕和土墙用来作肥料，有的采用过去烧肥的方法解决肥料问题。（按：烧肥的方法比较简便而且很快。烧的方法是先根据需要肥料数量挖二尺深一尺宽十字形的深沟，用粗木柴或石片把沟篷起来当作风口，上面铺一层约一尺四、五寸厚的柴草，柴草上面撒一层山皮土，然后就一层柴草一层土的铺上去，铺到两层时就点火烧，火旺时再继续铺柴草和土，只要烧四五天就成功了。）
    陕西地区去年回茬小麦约有六百万亩，产量为正茬麦60％左右，今年回茬小麦面积比去年还多。为了争取今年回茬小麦丰收，各地农业社都重视了对回茬小麦的管理工作。很多农业社对回茬小麦施了追肥，并且普遍地进行了冬灌。
