Around the "Book Festival"
	Chen Bochui

	Sunday morning, stepping on the ice and snow, a crisp cracking sound echoed once or twice. The cold wind rushed in, and the chill evoked a feeling of shrinking. I adjusted the scarf around my neck and braved the wind to go to the Fourth Alley Primary School of Dongsi Pailou.

	"We have prepared everything! Please come on time." As I walked, I kept hearing these two straightforward and clear sentences. At the same time, the innocent and lovely image of the Young Pioneers, with their faces flushed from the cold and their eyes wide with eager anticipation, reappeared before my eyes.

	"What the children say is what they mean. They never take anything lightly, I mustn't let them down because of my lateness." My pace quickened, and I tapped the frozen ground with a "ch-ch-ch" sound.

	Sure enough, as soon as I entered the venue, after just looking around and not even having had time to look through the hundreds of "reading notes" displayed on the tables, the loudspeaker and drum sounds started. They really had prepared everything and started on time.

	The flag bearer carried the team flag onto the stage, and team members followed one after another in step. From the serious little faces and the pairs of dark, bright eyes, one couldn't help but feel naturally excited, wishing one had the legendary magical long arms to gather them all together in a hug. How much I love them!

	After the ceremony, the main activity of the Brigade Day followed – the "Book Festival."

	Then I heard poetry recitations, storytellings, song performances, and even dramatic readings with costumes, all quite wonderful programs, with materials drawn from extracurricular reading materials. From the skilled performances, one could see the children's love for books and their joyful desire to appreciate literary works, while also expressing their reading ability and level of understanding of the reading materials.

	The solemn and quiet atmosphere gradually permeated with lively and warm air, just like a frozen stream lying under the spring sunshine, gradually thawing and emitting a happy sound of flowing water.

	From those innocent and unrestrained voices, actions, and expressions, I foresaw that they would grow into scientists, writers, musicians, and artists through learning and practice. Indeed, young green trees have already stood tall on the earth, waiting only for sunlight and rain to grow into towering trees, good pillars of society. And in the vast and broad motherland, the sun is bright, and the rain and dew are nourishing. Today's "Book Festival" proves this beautiful scene.

	I blessed them and encouraged them. I talked about some methods and experiences of reading and writing, and then used my own dim childhood—the spiritual hunger and pain of loving to read but not being able to get books—to make a clear contrast with their golden childhood and happy life. The children were clearly also moved, looking at the slightly fluttering team flag and the bright red scarves around their necks.

	This relaxed, happy, and educational Young Pioneers organization activity ended in two and a half hours. It seemed that everyone felt that the time had passed too quickly and was too short.

	In the evening, under the lamplight, I once again held up the gift from the Brigade Committee, caressing them like a loving mother caressing her beloved child, afraid of hurting them, carefully and cherishly turning the pages. These "reading notes," large and small, each had its own characteristics from content to form, enough to be called "rich and colorful." Not only were there articles written sincerely and delightfully to read, but also illustrations and cartoons drawn very interestingly and surprisingly to see. Each cover was also ingeniously designed, each with its own style. One can imagine that the children were doing "homework" in extracurricular reading as diligently and seriously as in classroom learning. They expressed their wisdom and artistic talent through independent thinking in their full heads, and even more through the flexible fingers. What is precious is that these booklets are the beautiful fruits of the children's creative and active labor, which has been developed and accumulated bit by bit in extracurricular reading assignments.

	"I didn't expect to see a hundred flowers blooming in these booklets!" I exclaimed, my own face also turning red. Thinking of Leo Tolstoy's "Children's Wisdom" that I had read, I gently placed these "masterpieces," which seemed to me like shining pearls, back into a large red paper envelope and then into the bookcase.

	I raised my head, gazing at the light, and silently recited, "How lovely the children are! You will be much stronger than us!"

	The light became brighter, shining like a transparent cloud, as if I heard an echo, first a high-pitched voice, and then thousands and millions of voices roaring like the ocean, shouting in unison: "Be prepared: to fight for the realization of communism and the great cause of the motherland! -- Always be prepared!"

	Ah, tonight, I will be joyfully sleepless.

    “书节”前后
    陈伯吹
    星期日，清早，脚踩着冰雪，发出一声两声松脆的破裂声。冷风迎面扑来，寒意勾起了瑟缩的感觉。我把脖子上的围巾整了整，顶着风赶往东四牌楼四条小学去。
    “我们一切都准备好了！请您准时来参加。”一边走着，一边耳朵旁不住地响着这两句率直而又清朗的话。同时在眼面前再现着冻红了脸的、睁大着迫切期待的眼的少先队员的天真可爱的形象。
      “孩子们说什么，就是什么。他们对待一切事情从来不肯含糊的，可别叫他们因了我的迟到而觉得失望。”我的脚步加紧起来，嚓、嚓、嚓地叩着冰冻的地面。
    果然，当我迈进会场，刚巡视了一周，还没来得及翻看展览在桌子上的上百本“读书笔记”本儿，喇叭和鼓声就响起来了，他们真的一切都准备好了，而且准时开始。
    旗手擎着队旗出场，队员一队又一队地紧跟着齐步前进。从一张张严肃的小脸上，一双双乌黑有神的眼睛里，叫人心里头自然而然地激动起来，恨不得长着传说中的神奇的长臂，把他们紧紧地围在一起拥抱起来。我多么爱着他们！
    仪式完毕以后，接着就是大队日的中心活动——“书节”。
    于是我听到了诗的朗诵，故事的讲述，歌曲的演唱，还有化装的表情阅读等等，这些相当精彩的节目，材料都从课外读物中取来。从纯熟的表演里可以看出孩子们对于书籍的热爱和文艺作品欣赏的喜悦的愿望，同时也表达了他们对于读物的阅读能力和理解程度。
    庄严静穆的空气中逐渐渗进了活泼温暖的气息，正像冰冻的小溪躺在春天的阳光下逐渐解冻而发出一种水流的欢乐的声音。
    我从那些天真烂漫的声音、动作、表情里，预见到了他们将在学习和锻炼中成长为科学家、文学家、音乐家、艺术家。可不是，新绿的小树已经挺立在大地上了，只等到阳光和雨露，即便成长为参天大树，好作社会栋梁。而在辽阔广大的祖国，阳光灿烂，雨露滋润，今天的“书节”就证明了这美丽的景象。
    我祝福了他们，也鼓励了他们，我谈了一些读书、作文的方法和经验，再用我自己的暗淡的童年——爱读书而得不到书的精神上的饥饿和苦痛，和他们金色的童年的幸福生活作了鲜明的对比。孩子们显然也被激动了，望着微微飘动的队旗，看着自己胸前鲜艳的红领巾。
    这个轻松愉快的、具有教育意义的少先队的组织生活，在两个半小时内结束了，似乎谁都觉得时间过得太快，也太短促了。
    晚上，在灯光底下，我再一次捧出大队委员会的赠礼，像慈母抚摩爱子似的，害怕会碰伤它们，小心地珍惜地翻读着。这些大大小小的“读书笔记”本儿，从内容到形式都各有各的特色，够得上说一声“丰富多采”。不仅有写得真挚而令人读了喜悦的文章，也还有画得非常有趣而令人看了惊奇的插图和漫画，每一本的封面装帧，也都别出心裁，各具风格。想见孩子们在课外阅读的时候像课堂学习一样地勤勤恳恳郑重其事地做着“作业”。他们通过了饱满的脑袋的独立思考，更通过了灵活的手指表现了自己的智慧和艺术天才。珍贵的是这些小册子乃是孩子们在课外阅读作业中发挥了、并且积累了一点一滴的劳动的创造性和积极性的美丽的成果。
      “想不到在这些小册子里看到了百花齐放！”我赞叹着，自己的脸也红了。一边想起了读过的列夫·托尔斯泰写的“儿童的智慧”来，一边把这些在我眼睛里看来就像是光芒四射的珍珠似的“墨宝”，轻轻地放还在一个大红的纸封袋里，再放到书橱里面去。
    我抬起头来，凝视着灯光，默默地念着：“多可爱的孩子们！你们会比我们强得多！”
    灯光愈加明亮了，耀着一团透明的云雾似的，仿佛，我听到了一片回声，先是一个高亢的声音，随后像海洋般奔腾的几千百万个声音一齐喊出来：“准备着：为实现共产主义和祖国的伟大事业而奋斗！——时刻准备着！”
    啊，今夜，我将喜而不寐。
