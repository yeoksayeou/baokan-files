Xinhua News Agency, January 10th -- The news of British Prime Minister Eden's resignation has elicited different reactions in Washington and Paris.

According to reports, in his statement on Eden's resignation, Eisenhower only referred to Eden as his "old friend" and did not express "regret" as is usually the case. Sources say that American officials privately welcomed Eden's resignation, considering it a step towards "restoring" US-British relations.

Some reports point out that Washington was unwilling to deal with Eden because he was directly linked to the Anglo-French discredited military adventure in Egypt; and this American dissatisfaction with Eden may have had some influence on Eden's decision to resign. Many people in Washington, when commenting on Eden's resignation, emphasized the failure of the British invasion of Egypt, and considered that this failure "dramatically declared the end of an era of British history as a great power." At the same time, it was pointed out that although Eden has stepped down, the divisions between the United States and Britain caused by conflicting interests and different views are far from over.

Members of the U.S. Congress have different focuses on this matter. Representative Vorys, the main Republican foreign policy spokesman in the House, said that Eden's resignation "is a good thing for Anglo-American relations." However, some senators also expressed "regret," believing that Eden's resignation was "a sign of the further weakening of a major ally." Democratic Senator Fulbright said he was concerned that Eden's resignation might lead to early general elections in Britain and a Labor Party victory; he believed it would be more difficult for the United States to deal with a Labor government.

In Paris, the news of Eden's resignation caused shock and unease. United Press International reported that France felt more isolated than ever on the Suez issue. After receiving the news, French Prime Minister Mollet wrote a personal letter to Eden expressing his condolences. Agence France-Presse quoted French sources as saying that Anglo-French friendly consultations were consolidated during the "most difficult moments" of the past year, thanks to Eden's actions.

In addition, the news of Eden's resignation also resonated at the United Nations headquarters. Commonwealth figures there believe this is a huge victory for Egypt. Another comment was that if Washington had given its British ally more support on the Middle East issue last year, Eden's resignation might not have happened.

    美法对艾登辞职反应不同
    在华盛顿：总统未感遗憾，官员表示欢迎
    在巴黎：政府震惊和不安，摩勒写信慰问
    新华社10日讯　英国首相艾登辞职的消息在华盛顿和巴黎引起了不同的反响。
    据消息说，艾森豪威尔在就艾登辞职问题发表的声明中，只把艾登称作他的“老朋友”，而并没有像通常那样表示“遗憾”。消息说，美国官员对艾登辞职私下表示欢迎，认为这是“恢复”美英关系的一个步骤。
    有消息指出，华盛顿不愿意同艾登打交道，因为他同英法在埃及的声名扫地的军事冒险是直接联结在一起的；而美国这种不满意艾登的情绪可能对艾登的决定辞职有某些影响。华盛顿许多人士在评论艾登辞职时强调指出了英国进攻埃及所遭到的失败，并且认为这种失败“戏剧性地宣告了英国历史上作为大国的一个时代的结束”。同时，消息指出，艾登虽然退出了舞台，但是英美两国由于利害冲突和看法不同而引起的分歧还远没有结束。
    美国国会人士对这件事的着眼点各有不同。众议院共和党外交政策主要发言人伏利斯说，艾登辞职“对英美关系来说是件好事情”。但是，也有些参议员认为艾登辞职是“主要盟国进一步衰弱的标志”，因而表示“遗憾”。民主党参议员富布赖特说，他担心艾登辞职可能会促成英国提前举行普选并且使工党获胜；他认为美国要同工党政府相处就会更加困难。
    在巴黎，艾登辞职的消息引起了震惊和不安。合众社报道说，这使法国感到在苏伊士问题上比以前任何时候都更为孤立。法国总理摩勒在得到这个消息以后，就写了一封私人信给艾登表示慰问。法新社引法国人士的话说，英法在过去一年中的“最严重的时刻里”巩固了友好协商关系，这要归功于艾登的行动。
    此外，艾登辞职的消息在联合国总部里也有反应。那里的英联邦人士认为这是埃及的一个巨大胜利。另一种评论是，如果华盛顿去年在中东问题上给它的英国盟国以更多的支持，那本来可能不会发生艾登辞职的事情。
