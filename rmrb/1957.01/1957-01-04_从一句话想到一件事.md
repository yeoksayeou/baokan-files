From a Sentence, a Thought

Bayin

Not long ago, the CCP郫县 (Pi County) Committee in Sichuan organized a large number of cadres to go deep into farmers' homes for visits. During the visits, the masses put forward more than 400 criticisms and suggestions, enabling the cadres to understand many problems they had not understood in the past, and also telling the cadres how they should carry out their work in the future.

When an old farmer saw the visiting group coming to his home, he warmly grabbed the cadre's arm and said a few words: "In the past, I only saw you making reports at the conference, far away from you. It was difficult to talk to you even if I had something to say. Today, I finally looked forward to your arrival." These words, which were both welcoming and critical, sounded simple but were very meaningful to think about.

"From the masses, to the masses," is the principle we must follow to implement the mass line. However, some comrades often only implement half of this principle—only "to the masses" but not "from the masses." Specifically, in their work, they only tell the masses what they should do, and rarely ask for their opinions. What will be the result of this? That old farmer has already summed it up: the masses can only listen to your "reports" "far away from you," and it is "difficult for them to talk to you."

Now it seems that for many cadres, letting them "go to the masses" does not seem difficult, but "coming from the masses" is. This is because the opinions of the higher authorities on a certain task are relatively concentrated and easy to systematically publicize to the masses. However, the opinions of the masses on a certain task are very scattered and difficult to concentrate at once. Therefore, to avoid the difficult and take the easy route, only "going" but not "coming," the mass line is invisibly reduced by 50%.

However, without truly "coming from the masses," it is also difficult to truly "go to the masses." That is to say, the opinions of the higher authorities on a certain task are determined based on many relevant circumstances. Whether these opinions are suitable for the situation in each region needs to be further examined among the masses. If these opinions are suitable for the local situation, they will naturally be easier to implement. If they are not suitable for the situation in a certain region, it is necessary to carefully listen to the opinions of the masses, promptly ask the higher authorities to consider, and re-establish measures that are tailored to local conditions. Otherwise, even if we are full of enthusiasm to "go to the masses," the result will still be that we cannot "go." Therefore, to truly "go to the masses," we must truly "come from the masses." This matter seems simple, but it is not easy. Therefore, in our work, we must make the greatest efforts to have a mass line that is worthy of the name.

    从一句话想到一件事
    巴音
    不久前，中共四川郫县县委会曾组织大批干部深入农户进行访问。在访问中，群众共提出四百多条批评和建议，使干部们了解了许多过去不了解的问题，也告诉干部以后应当怎样的进行工作。
    有一个老农民看见访问组到他家里时，热情地抓着干部的臂膀，说出了这样几句话：“从前光看见你在大会上做报告，离你老远，有话也难对你说；今天可把你盼来了。”这几句既是欢迎、又是批评的话，听来似很简单，想来却很意味深长。
      “从群众中来，到群众中去”，这是我们贯彻群众路线必须遵守的准则。可是，有些同志往往只执行这个准则的一半——只“到群众中去”，而不“从群众中来”。具体来说，就是：在工作中，只是告诉群众应当怎样怎样，很少去征询征询群众的意见。这样的结果将会如何呢？那位老农民已经做了总结：群众只能“离你老远”地听你“做报告”，他们“有话也难对你说”。
    现在看来，在不少的干部中，让他们“到群众中去”似乎并不困难，困难的是“从群众中来”。因为，上级对某一工作的意见比较集中，容易系统地向群众宣传；而群众对某一工作的意见却非常分散，很难一下集中起来。于是，避难就易，只“去”不“来”，群众路线在无形中被削减了50％。
    但是，没有真正的“从群众中来”，也很难真正的“到群众中去”。即以上级对某一工作的意见来说，它是根据许多有关情况来确定的，至于这些意见是不是适合每一个地区的情况，这就需要进一步在群众中考查了。如果这些意见适合当地情况，自然就会较容易贯彻执行。如果不适合某一地区的情况，这就需要认真听取群众意见，及时提请上级考虑，重新订出因地制宜的办法来。不然的话，尽管我们是满腔热忱地希望“到群众中去”，结果仍然还是“去”不了。所以，要真正的“到群众中去”，必须真正的“从群众中来”。这事看来简单，其实并不容易，因此，在工作中必须做最大的努力，才会有名副其实的群众路线。
