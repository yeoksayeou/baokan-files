	South China's Flowers Bloom Early to Welcome Spring
	Huang Xiangqing
	Before the Spring Festival, the streets in Guangzhou that are designated for the flower market every year have already transformed into a colorful sea of flowers. On the scaffolding set up along the roadsides, the blossoming and budding peach blossoms, dotted with red stamens, form peach groves along the way; complementing a colorful wall are golden and purple chrysanthemums, bright red and rouge-powdered peonies, and fragrant and pure white narcissus; potted tangerines and scarlet kumquats resemble ten thousand sparks of fire in the midst of the flowers. Crowds are gathering here, with flower buyers holding the flowers above their heads as they surge forward. When people bring the flowers home, children clap their hands and cheer, and the elderly are joyful at heart: Spring is coming again!
	Master Li Yuan, a flower grower from the Huadi Agricultural Cooperative with fifty years of experience, told me: "In recent years, Guangzhou's flower market has become more prosperous year by year. Our cooperative will put more than 20,000 pots of flowers and trees on the market this year, one-third more than last year." He continued, "There was prosperous business in the old days, but at that time it depended on big customers and high prices for small sales. Now the prices are reasonable, and people's lives have improved. Everyone is willing to spend three or two yuan to buy happiness and good fortune for the whole family."
	A few days ago, I crossed the Pearl River and visited the famous Huadi and Yongkou Agricultural Cooperatives. Someone told me that planting flowers and trees requires a lot of capital, and people often worried about lacking capital when they worked individually. Now that they are in cooperatives, flower growers no longer have to worry. In recent years, the large-scale acquisition of fresh flowers by tea companies and wineries has provided a stable outlet for the production of fresh flowers here. The income of flower growers has increased, and their lives have improved as a result. To celebrate the Spring Festival, each household can pre-draw fifty to more than one hundred yuan from the cooperative. The members are all happily buying New Year's goods and preparing to celebrate the Spring Festival joyfully.
	The first state-owned fragrant flower extraction factory in the country was established in Huadi in October 1955. A small part of the machinery was installed in June 1956, and jasmine concrete can now be extracted. After the entire factory is completed, it can also produce natural fragrances such as white magnolia, rose, and bitter orange. These fragrances will become excellent products on the international market.
	In the past, people used the line "The daughters and sons of Huatian do not wear flowers" to reflect the suffering of flower farmers; now, this has become a thing of the past. In this Spring Festival of renewal, they will cultivate more and more beautiful flowers for the working people, welcoming another beautiful spring.

    南国花开早迎春
    黄向青
    春节以前，广州市年年划为花市的几条街，已经变成五彩缤纷的花的海洋。路旁搭起来的棚架上，盛放的、含苞半吐的、红蕊点点的桃花，形成夹道的桃林；衬托着一堵彩墙，是金黄色的紫色的菊花，大红的、红里敷粉的芍药，还有幽香洁白的水仙；盆栽柑橘、朱砂桔在万花丛中好似万朵火花。这里簇拥着人群，买花的人把鲜花举在头上向前涌着。当人们把鲜花带回家，小孩子拍手欢叫，老年人喜在心头：春天又来临了！
    花地农业社的种花五十年的师傅黎远老伯对我说：“这几年，广州的花市一年比一年兴旺。我们社今年上市二万多盆花木，比去年多了三分之一。”他接着说：“旧时代也有过兴旺的生意，不过那时候是靠大主顾，高价少卖。现在价钱合理，人民的生活也改善了，谁都愿意花上个三元两块，买来个满门吉庆。”
    几天前，我渡过珠江，访问了著名的花地和涌口两个农业社。有人告诉我说，栽植花木压本较大，单干的时候人们经常为了缺少本钱发愁；现在合作化了，种花的人变得无忧无愁了。这几年，由于茶业公司和酿酒厂大量收购鲜花，使这里的鲜花生产有了稳定的销路。种花的人收入增加了，生活因此改善了。为了过春节，每户都可以向社里预支五十元到一百多元，社员们都在欢欢喜喜地买年货，准备快快乐乐地过春节。
    全国第一个国营香花浸提厂1955年10月在花地建立，1956年6月已经装好一小部分机器，现在可以提练茉莉浸膏；全厂建成以后，还可生产白玉兰、玫瑰、玳玳花等天然香精。这些香精将成为国际市场上的佳品。
    前人曾用“花田儿女不簪花”的诗句来反映花农生活的痛苦；现在，这已经成为往事了。在这万象更新的春节里，他们将培育更多更美的鲜花，给劳动人民，迎接又一个美好的春天。
