    Thrift or Waste
    A recent issue of the Taiyuan Institute of Technology school newspaper in Shanxi Province, published on January 4th, featured two news items on its front page: one reported on school leaders calling on everyone to run the school diligently and thriftily and to oppose extravagance and waste. The other reported that the school had given very generous material rewards to the twenty-six faculty and staff members who participated in the Russian language examination last December. Not only did the eleven people with better exam results receive a total of 700 yuan in bonuses, but even the fifteen people with poorer exam results each received a gold pen as encouragement. We don't understand whether adopting this method of encouragement is running the school diligently and thriftily, or is it extravagance and waste?

    节俭还是浪费
    山西省太原工学院1月4日出版的一期校刊上，在第一版登了这样两条新闻：一条新闻是报道学校领导上号召大家勤俭办校反对铺张浪费。另一条新闻却报道了去年12月间学校对参加俄文考试的二十六名教职员作了十分丰富的物质奖励。不但考试成绩较好的十一人共得奖金达七百元，而且连考试成绩较差的十五人也各得金笔一枝，以示鼓励。我们不明白采用这种鼓励的办法是勤俭办校呢，还是铺张浪费？
