    "It's not mine, it belongs to the public"
    On December 17th, the secretary of the General Affairs Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, holding a list of 142 people, urgently requested the accounting department to pay 6,092.50 yuan according to the list and distribute it to various departments. Old Tian from the barbershop was also suddenly presented with 30 yuan. Old Tian was taken aback. After inquiring, he learned that he had borrowed 30 yuan from the mutual aid fund when he had a coat made; the department was repaying the debt on Old Tian's behalf. However, Old Tian felt that: he was wearing the coat himself, so it wasn't right for the public to pay for it; also, he had the ability to repay the debt himself. So he refused to accept this "windfall." Refusals also occurred in a few other units. This strange story cannot but raise questions: why is the General Affairs Department so generous?
    It turns out that the leaders of the General Affairs Department saw that the unit's welfare funds had a large surplus; secondly, they wanted to "care" for the hardships of the masses; and thirdly, they wanted to "implement" the instructions to repay debts for needy workers. So they legitimately began to repay debts for "needy workers."
    Are these subsidized "needy workers" really in need of subsidies? Just look at a few registration forms to know. One section chief wrote on the registration form: "A family of eight, monthly salary and other income of 184 yuan (plus his wife's scholarship and the eldest daughter's income, it should actually be 299 yuan). The reasons for the debt are: his ex-wife's mother was ill; his younger sister came to Beijing for treatment during the summer vacation; his brother-in-law came to Beijing this year, his nephew came to Beijing twice, and his niece came to Beijing twice for treatment..." Such "difficulties" were actually given "full reimbursement" of "subsidies." Another section chief's registration form only had the words "Name," "Debt of 45 yuan," and "Subsidy of 45 yuan," and this was written by the department's secretary. Other people had borrowed money for weddings, or their life plans were not well thought out... Even stranger, some people only applied for a portion, but the leadership generously gave them full subsidies. For example, one comrade owed 179 yuan, and he applied for a subsidy of 79 yuan, but he was "subsidized" 179 yuan.
    Coincidentally, just two days after the money for repaying debts was issued, the unit sent out retroactive wage payments for adjusted wages and ranks. Initial statistics show that among 136 people, 88 people received subsidies to pay off their debts and also received retroactive wage payments, and 60 of them received retroactive wage payments that were more than the amount of their original debt. It can be seen how generous they are when spending public money!　Wu Song

### “不是我的，是公家的”

    “不是我的，是公家的”
    12月17日，中华全国总工会总务部的秘书拿着一百四十二人的名单，要会计科火速按名单支付人民币六千零九十二元五角，各处分送。理发室老田的面前，也突如其来地送到了三十元钱。老田为之一怔，打听之后，才知道原来他做大衣的时候借过互助会三十元；这是部里代老田还债的。可是老田感到：大衣自己穿，款要公家出，有点说不过去；同时自己也有力偿还欠款。于是他就拒绝接受这笔“意外之财”。在个别单位里也出现了拒收情况。这个奇闻不能不引起人们的疑问：这个总务部为什么这么慷慨呢？
    原来，总务部的领导人员一则看到机关福利费结余很多；二则为了“关心”群众的疾苦；三则又是“贯彻执行”代困难职工还债的指示精神。于是便名正言顺地为“困难职工”还起债来了。
    这些受到补助的“困难职工”是不是真的非要补助不可呢？只要看看几份登记表就可以知道了。有一位处长在登记表上填着：“八口之家，每月工资及其他收入一百八十四元（加上他爱人的助学金和长女的收入实际上应该是二百九十九元）。欠债原因是：前妻母病；暑期妹妹来京治病；今年妹夫来京、侄儿两次来京、表侄女两次来京治病……”像这样的“困难”，也居然得到了“全部报销”的“补助”。还有一位处长的登记表上，只有“姓名”、“欠款四十五元”和“补助四十五元”的字样，而这还是部里的秘书写的。其他的人，有的是结婚借款，有的是生活计划不周……更奇怪的是有人只申请一部分，领导上却慷慨地给予全部补助。如有个同志欠债一百七十九元，本人申请补助七十九元，却给他“补助”了一百七十九元。
    事情真凑巧，代还欠债的钱刚发下两天，机关又送来了调整工资和级别的补发工资。初步统计一百三十六人当中，有八十八人得到还清欠债的补助，又领到了补发工资，而补发工资钱数比他原来的欠债钱数还多的就有六十人。可见他们在开支公家的钱的时候是多么慷慨呀！　吴松
