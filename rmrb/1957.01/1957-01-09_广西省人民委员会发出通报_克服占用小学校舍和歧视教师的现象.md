The Guangxi Provincial People's Committee recently issued a circular regarding overcoming chaotic phenomena in schools and the negative phenomena of disrespecting and discriminating against elementary school teachers. The circular stated that the chaotic phenomena in schools in various localities are quite serious. In addition to some agricultural cooperatives, township people's committees, supply and marketing cooperatives, grain management offices, and other units often occupying elementary school buildings and playgrounds, and damaging desks and chairs, there are also many department cadres who disrespect and discriminate against elementary school teachers, not treating them as cadres. Some grain supply stations do not sell good rice to teachers, some oil companies supply peanut oil to general cadres but only tea oil to elementary school teachers, and the supply amount is also less than that for cadres; some food companies ration pork to cadres, while elementary school teachers have to line up with the masses to buy it; some public elementary school teachers do not receive public medical certificates, or even if they have medical certificates, they cannot enjoy the same treatment as general cadres; some district and township cadres still excessively arrange for elementary school teachers to participate in central work and social activities, or casually order elementary school teachers to work as correspondents or cooks; some cadres even arbitrarily tie up, beat, and detain teachers, infringing on human rights.

Therefore, the circular requires all localities to quickly take effective measures. Directly subordinate units of the province should notify their subordinate departments to correct the above-mentioned deviations and educate cadres to respect elementary school teachers. People's committees at all levels should immediately order units occupying or borrowing school buildings and school equipment to quickly return them to the schools for use. If there is any damage during the period of occupation or borrowing, the occupying or borrowing units should assist in the repair. Each city and county should also frequently explain the important significance of elementary school education to the people and cadres through people's congresses, cadre meetings at all levels, etc., and cultivate a social atmosphere of respecting elementary school teachers. Educational administrative departments at all levels should more earnestly overcome chaotic phenomena from within, and must also frequently care for and educate teachers to improve their political awareness and professional level, and earnestly run the education cause well.

    广西省人民委员会发出通报
    克服占用小学校舍和歧视教师的现象
    本报讯　广西省人民委员会最近发出关于克服学校混乱现象和轻视、歧视小学教师的不良现象的通报。通报中说，目前各地学校中的混乱现象是相当严重的。除有些农业社、乡人民委员会、供销社、粮食管理所等单位常占用小学校舍、球场、打坏课桌椅外，还有不少部门的干部轻视、歧视小学教师，不把小学教师当干部看待的情况。有的粮食供应站不卖好米给教师，有的油脂公司对一般干部供应花生油，而对小学教师只供应茶油，供应分量也比干部少；有的食品公司定量供应猪肉给干部，而小学教师就得和群众一起排队购买；有些公立小学教师得不到公费医疗证，或虽有医疗证，但不能享受与一般干部同等的待遇；有的区、乡干部仍过多地安排小学教师参加中心工作和社会活动，或随便命令小学教师做通讯员、炊事员的工作；甚至有些干部随便绑打、扣押教师，侵犯人权。
    为此，通报要求各地迅速采取有效措施。省直属各有关单位，要通知所属部门纠正上述偏向，教育干部尊重小学教师，各级人民委员会应即责成占用、借用校舍及校具的单位迅速将校舍、校具归还学校使用。如在占用、借用期间有所损坏，占用、借用单位应协助修理。各市、县还应经常通过人民代表大会、各级干部会议等向人民群众和干部说明小学教育的重要意义，养成尊重小学教师的社会风气。各级教育行政部门更应认真克服来自内部的混乱现象，并须经常关心与教育教师提高政治觉悟和业务水平，认真办好教育事业。
