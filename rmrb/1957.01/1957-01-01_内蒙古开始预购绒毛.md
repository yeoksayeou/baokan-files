The total amount of advance purchase deposits for fleece in the region will reach over 7 million yuan, an increase of two and a half times compared to 1956.

    内蒙古开始预购绒毛
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区最近开始了新的年度的绒毛预购工作。今年，农产品采购部门和供销合作社，除了对绵羊毛、山羊毛、羊绒、驼毛进行预购外，还在重点地区对牛毛、马鬃、马尾实行预购。全区投放绒毛预购定金将达七百余万元，比1956年增加二倍半。自治区在预购工作的布置中，强调了避免层层拖拉、认真遵守自愿原则、照顾群众必需的留用量和各商业部门加强协作等问题。
