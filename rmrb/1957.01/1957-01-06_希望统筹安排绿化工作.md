    Hope for Unified Planning of Greening Work
    Qingjiang County, Jiangxi Province, has more than 200,000 mu of barren mountains, of which more than 170,000 mu are hilly areas. Farmers living near these barren mountains mostly have experience in planting citrus on mountain land. For example, orange trees planted on mountain terraces in townships such as Zhonglin and Jinglou during the Qing Dynasty still bear abundant fruit every year. Therefore, the wasteland in these hilly areas can very well be used to develop citrus fruits. However, due to the different work responsibilities and uncoordinated steps of the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Department of Forestry, the development plan for this area has been affected. The agricultural department emphasizes developing fruit trees in this area, while the forestry department emphasizes developing forests, which has led to some places – such as Changfu and Jianghuang townships – originally planting pine and fir trees on the mountains, but after two years, they uprooted the pines and firs and replanted citrus fruits. This not only wasted manpower and resources but also affected the completion of the country's overall construction plan, and the masses felt at a loss.
    In order to develop the rural economy according to local conditions and to green the motherland in a planned way, it is hoped that the state will implement unified leadership and overall planning for forestry work and fruit tree timber and other work.　　Wang Shuqi

    希望统筹安排绿化工作
    江西省清江县现有荒山二十多万亩，其中十七万多亩是丘陵地带。住在这些荒山地区附近的农民，大都具有山地种植柑桔的经验。如中林、经楼等乡在清朝年间利用山地梯田种植的桔树，至今还每年满结果实。因此，这些丘陵地区的荒地是很可以利用来发展柑桔的。但是，由于江西省农业厅和林业厅的工作性质不同，步调不一致，使这个地区的发展计划受到影响。农业部门强调在这个地区发展果树；林业部门又强调要发展森林，以致有些地方——如昌傅、姜璜等乡本来在山地上种了松树和杉树，过了两年，又拔掉松杉改种柑桔。这不但浪费了人力、物力，同时也影响到国家整个建设计划的完成，和群众感到无所适从。
    为了因地制宜地发展农村经济，有计划的绿化祖国，希望国家对林业工作和果树用材等工作实行统一领导，统筹安排。　　王书琪
