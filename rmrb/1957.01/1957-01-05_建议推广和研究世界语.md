    Suggestions for Promoting and Researching Esperanto
    (I)
    I was very excited to read Comrade Zhang Qicheng's article "An International Conference Without Translation" in your newspaper on December 15th.
    Esperanto is a scientific international auxiliary language. It is not the language of a particular nation, but the creation of Polish doctor Zamenhof. The characteristics of Esperanto are: using the simplest Latin letters in the world's writing systems; each letter is pronounced, and pronunciation and spelling are consistent; the stress has a fixed position; each part of speech has a definite ending (such as -o for nouns, -a for adjectives, -e for adverbs, -as for verb present tense, -is for verb past tense, -os for verb future tense), the changes of endings have definite rules, and the selected roots are mostly common to all countries; the grammar structure is simple and scientific... Therefore, it is easy to learn and use.
    I personally used to be an Esperantist, and I still have deep feelings for Esperanto today. This is because Esperanto played an enlightening and encouraging role for me. I was expelled from school at the age of sixteen (1933), and seeking knowledge became a problem. At this time, Esperanto helped me improve my culture and found me many revolutionary comrades. Before the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, I had many good friends in the Soviet Union, Sweden, Japan, and several cities in China whom I had never met, and they gave me a lot of knowledge and spiritual strength.
    Before the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese Esperanto movement, under the leadership of the China Left-Wing Esperantist League, played a considerable positive role. It not only supported and promoted the Chinese people's revolutionary war culturally, but also provided many revolutionary intellectual cadres for the subsequent Anti-Japanese War. After liberation, the All-China Esperanto Association established an organization and published newspapers and periodicals for external publicity. However, it did not carry out much mass activity.
    Comrade Zhang Qicheng saw many new atmospheres from the 41st International Esperanto Congress, and I hope that these new atmospheres will soon appear in China as well. I hope that the All-China Esperanto Association will launch mass activities to promote Esperanto.

    Your newspaper published an article entitled "Soviet Academy of Sciences Discusses Esperanto Problems" in the "Academic Trends" column on November 28th. The article reported the speech of Soviet Dr. Bukalev, who said: "Esperanto has not only proved that an artificial international auxiliary language is theoretically possible, but also its existence and activities have proved this in practice." I express my heartfelt support for this view. Esperanto has not only been widely studied and applied internationally, but it has also had great development in our country. There were Esperantists in our country who traveled the world using Esperanto. "Popola Mondo," edited by the Esperantist organization in our country, played a significant role in reporting our country's revolutionary struggle and construction. Unfortunately, in recent years, our country's vigorous Esperanto activities have become silent. I warmly hope that Esperantists and linguists in our country will also widely launch academic discussions on Esperanto issues. And I hope that relevant parties will provide support.

### 建议推广和研究世界语

    建议推广和研究世界语
    （一）
    读到你报12月15日所载张企程同志的“一个不用翻译的国际会议”一文十分兴奋。
    世界语（Esperanto），是一种科学的国际辅助语。它不是某一民族的语言，而是波兰柴门霍夫博士的创造。世界语的特点是：用世界文字中最简便的拉丁字母；每个字母都发音，而且读写一致；重音有固定的位置；各种词类都有确定的字尾（如—o为名词，—a为形容词，—e为副词，—as为动词现在时，—is为动词过去时，—os为动词将来时），字尾的变化有确定的规律，选用的字根多为各国所通用的；文法构造简易科学……。因此，学习和使用都很容易。
    我个人曾经是世界语者，而且今天仍然对世界语抱有深厚的感情。这是因为世界语曾对我起过启蒙和鼓舞的作用。我十六岁（1933年）被赶出了学校，求知成了问题。这时世界语帮我提高了文化，而且为我找到了许多革命的战友。抗日战争爆发之前，我在苏联、瑞典、日本及国内几个城市里，有不少未见过面的好朋友，他们给了我许多知识和精神力量。
    抗战以前，中国的世界语运动，在中国左翼世界语者联盟的领导之下，曾起过不小的积极作用。它不仅在文化上支持了和宣传了中国人民的革命战争，而且为以后的抗战提供了不少的革命知识分子干部。解放以后，中华全国世界语协会建立了组织，出版了对外宣传的报刊。但是，它没有进行多少群众性的活动。
    张企程同志从第四十一次国际世界语大会上看到了许多新气象，我希望这些新气象很快在中国也出现。希望中华全国世界语协会展开群众性的活动，推广世界语。

    你报11月28日“学术动态”栏内发表了“苏联科学院讨论世界语问题”一文，文中报道了苏联布卡略夫博士的发言，他说：“世界语（Esperanto）不仅证明了人工性的国际辅助语在理论上是可能的，而且它的存在和活动在实践上也证明了这一点。”对于这个见解，我表示衷心的拥护。世界语不仅在国际上得到广泛的研究和应用，而且在我国也有过很大的发展。我国曾有世界语者以世界语周游世界。我国世界语者组织所主编的“人民世界”（Popola Mondo），在报道我国的革命斗争和建设情况等方面，曾起了很大的作用。可惜近年以来，我国蓬勃的世界语活动却沉寂下去了。我热烈希望我国世界语者、语言学家也广泛展开世界语问题的学术讨论。并且希望有关方面给予支持。　　　　　　　许海清
