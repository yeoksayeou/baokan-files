    When I visited the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory on the afternoon of the 14th, I happened to come across a "Technical Debate Meeting" being held in a room next to a workshop. The subject of this "debate" was how to reasonably cut materials for repairing the traction beams of vehicles. The factory director, chief engineer, head of the technical inspection department, head of the process department, and some veteran workers all participated in the discussion of this difficult problem.

    Chang Chengpu, the deputy chief engineer who participated in the "debate" meeting, told me that the technicians in the factory believed that the reinforcement of vehicle traction should use four different reinforcement methods, such as electric welding and flat steel, depending on the degree of damage; the finished product inspectors believed that this would affect the quality of repair and insisted on using expensive channel steel. He said that today was already the third "debate" on this issue. During the debate, they consulted relevant Soviet materials based on different opinions, and then conducted on-site trials. He said: "I think this debate will lead to a final conclusion." Just as he said, at the end of the debate, everyone unanimously agreed with this opinion: adopting the former technical standard would not only not affect the quality but also save a lot of steel accessories.

    The technicians in this factory encountered several technical problems with large differences in the first half of last year, but they were all resolved well and implemented quickly after debate. In December of last year, when all the factory employees were looking for ways to increase production and save money, some technicians felt that the most prominent waste loophole in the factory was that many process standards and operating procedures were not unified or reasonable in understanding and implementation, resulting in waste of labor and raw materials. Some workers also said that there was waste caused by not differentiating between major and medium repairs of locomotives. The technicians absorbed the experience of giving play to collective wisdom in the past, and in mid-December of last year, they formally decided to hold irregular "Technical Debate Meetings" and regard the technical problems that urgently need to be solved in the current savings effort as the main topics of "debate".

    In the past month, more than 70 technical problems have been solved at the "Technical Debate Meetings", thereby revising inaccurate technical standards, reducing metal consumption, and shortening processing man-hours. However, the proposal and resolution of each problem are not smooth sailing. In December of last year, the technicians responsible for vehicle decomposition believed that when implementing the technical standards stipulated by the higher authorities, some usable accessories also became waste due to rigidly processing according to the original dimensions. For example, the higher authorities stipulated that when the wear thickness of the brake axle of a repaired locomotive exceeds 10% of the original, it should be replaced with new accessories. In fact, vehicles with a wear rate exceeding this index can still drive safely. They proposed to appropriately lower this standard; however, some finished product inspectors were afraid of affecting the quality of the locomotive and stubbornly disagreed with doing so. This issue was temporarily suspended from debate at the "debate" meeting because the two sides could not clearly argue. After specific analysis and research, a second "debate" meeting was held. At this meeting, everyone conducted actual tests at the operation site, and the result was that the wear rate of the brake axle was reduced by 3% compared with the original technical standard, and the quality of the locomotive could still be guaranteed. The technical standard was unified in the understanding of the technicians in the factory. When it was reported to the higher authorities, the relevant departments of the Ministry of Railways believed that this was a more economical technical standard, which could make full use of the old locomotive brake axle parts that were discarded in large quantities in the past.

    At another "Technical Debate Meeting", Chief Engineer Liu Chunhe proposed to revise an uneconomical technical standard for the coal water tank wheel hub hole of a certain type of locomotive. Based on the operating experience of the workers and the arguments of technical theory, he believed that this technical standard was too high, turning many old wheel hub holes worth 240 yuan each into waste. This suggestion has been adopted by the Ministry of Railways and notified to be promoted in relevant factories across the country.

    Many "debate" topics are proposed by workers. Not long ago, electric welders proposed that when electric welding wheel hubs in severe winter, the wheels are prone to cracks due to drastic changes in temperature. This difficult problem was quickly listed as a topic of the "Technical Debate Meeting". After debate, the technicians proposed to implement preheating processing before electric welding and heat treatment after electric welding. As a result, both technicians and workers implemented this new technical measure.

    This kind of "Technical Debate Meeting" has no fixed form and no regular meeting. Any workshop worker or technician who believes that there is a major technical problem in production submits it to the inspection department and process department, and then the person in charge determines the "debate" topic according to the severity and urgency of the problem. In order to make the debate effective, relevant personnel are notified in advance to prepare. When the meeting is held, everyone expresses their opinions and debates; if a conclusion cannot be reached temporarily, the meeting is adjourned, and then technical materials are consulted or on-site experiments are conducted, and preparations are made for the next "debate" to resolve the issue.

    “技术争论会”的新课题
    新华社记者　范银怀
    14日下午，记者到太原机车车辆修理厂访问的时候，正遇上一个车间隔壁的屋子里举行“技术争论会”。这次“争论”的是检修车辆牵引梁如何合理下料的问题。厂长、总工程师、技术检查科长、工艺科长和一些老工人都参加了这个疑难问题的讨论。
    参加“争论”会的副总工程师常承溥告诉我，厂里技术人员们认为车辆牵引的补强应根据损毁程度的不同，分别用电焊、平板钢等四种补强方法；成品验收人员认为这样会影响修车质量，坚持都用贵重的槽钢。他说，今天已经是第三次“争论”这个问题了。争论期间他们根据分歧意见，参看苏联有关的资料，然后再进行实地试用。他说：“我想这次争论，就会得出最后的结论来。”正像他说的，争论到最后，大家一致同意了这种意见：采用前一种技术标准，既不会影响质量，也能节约大量钢料配件。
    这个厂的技术人员们在去年上半年曾经遇到几个分歧很大的技术问题，但是经过争论，都解决得很好，贯彻得也快。去年12月全厂职工在寻觅增产节约门路的时候，有些技术人员感到厂里最突出的浪费漏洞，是过去许多工艺标准和操作规程在认识和执行中不统一或不合理，造成了劳力和原材料浪费。有些工人们也说，机车大修、中修不分，造成浪费。技术人员们吸收了过去发挥集体智慧的经验，在去年12月中旬，正式决定举行不定期的“技术争论会”，并且把当前节约中急待解决的技术问题当做“争论”的主要课题。
    一个月来，在“技术争论会”上已经解决了七十多项技术问题，从而修订了不确切的技术标准，减少了金属消耗和缩短了加工工时。但是，每一个问题的提出和解决，都不是一帆风顺的。去年12月份，负责车辆分解的技术人员认为：在执行上级规定的技术标准时，由于教条地依照原型尺寸加工，使部分能用的配件也成了废物。如上级规定检修机车制动轴磨损厚度超过原来10％的时候，就要一律更换为新配件。其实磨损率超过这个指标的车辆仍然能安全行车。他们提出要适度地降低这个标准；可是一些成品验收人员怕影响机车质量，执拗着不同意这样做。这个问题在“争论”会上因为双方争执不清，于是决定暂时停止争论。经过具体分析研究情况以后，又召开了第二次“争论”会。在这次会上大家到操作现场进行了实际试验，结果制动轴的磨耗率比原来技术标准降低3％，仍然可以保证机车质量。这项技术标准在本厂技术人员认识上得到了统一。在呈报上级的时候，铁道部有关部门认为这是比较经济的技术标准，它能把过去大量抛弃的机车制动轴旧件再充分利用。
    在另一次“技术争论会”上，总工程师刘春和提出修订一种机车的煤水车轮心毂孔不经济的技术标准。他根据工人们操作的经验和技术理论的论据，认为这项技术标准过高，把许多价值二百四十元一个的旧轮心孔变成了废物。这项建议已经被铁道部采纳，并且通报在全国各有关厂推行。
    不少“争论”课题是由工人们提出来的。不久以前，电焊工人们提出在严冬电焊车轮心的时候，因为冷热变化剧烈，车轮容易发生裂纹。这个疑难问题很快地被列为“技术争论会”的课题。经过争论，技术人员们提出在电焊前实行预热加工，电焊后进行热处理。结果技术人员和工人们都贯彻了这项新的技术措施。
    这种“技术争论会”没有固定形式，也没有例会。哪一个车间工人或技术人员认为在生产中有重大技术问题的分歧，就向检查科、工艺科提出，然后主管人员根据问题的轻重缓急确定“争论”课题。为了使争论收效大，会前预先通知有关人员做准备。到开会的时候，大家各述己见，展开争论；如果暂时不能得出结论，就休会，再参看技术资料或到现场实验，并且准备下次“争论”解决。
