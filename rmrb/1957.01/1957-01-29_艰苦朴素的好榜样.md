In the Fuling Special District Agricultural Products Procurement Bureau of Sichuan, people praised Comrade Zhang Ziyong, the secretary section chief, saying that he is always a good cadre who works hard and lives plainly.

This secretary section chief, who has been in the revolution for eleven years, has made thrift his habit. When the weather is warm, he always changes into two sets of blue cloth uniforms, washing and mending them, mending and wearing them. After washing and mending, the two sets of clothes have become faded and covered with patches. When the weather turns cold, he puts on his old cotton-padded clothes and old hat from four years ago as usual. He has two pairs of old rubber-soled leather shoes, which he wears in all seasons. When a hole is worn, he mends it and continues to wear them. He has lived in Fuling City for four or five years and has never been to a restaurant. Because the Procurement Bureau did not have enough housing, he voluntarily moved his family to a dilapidated house. The leaders prepared to ask a carpenter to renovate his dormitory, but he stopped them, saying, "It's good enough to live in, and we should save what we can. Our current life is much better than living in cave dwellings during the Anti-Japanese War, and it's already happy enough compared to the lives of ordinary farmers!" Then, he himself picked up some pieces of wood to block the drafts in the house.

Comrade Zhang Ziyong is not only a model of thrift in his personal life, but he also pays great attention to saving in his work.

Comrade Zhang Ziyong joined the Eighth Route Army in the year of the victory against Japan. He worked in the army for more than seven years and never spent a penny carelessly. When he was an administrator, he had to plan and calculate every penny he spent. He slept with the cooks and often told them stories about saving, so that they also developed a habit of paying attention to thrift.

In 1952, he was transferred to work in the Sichuan Fuling Special District Livestock Products Company, and he continued to pay attention to saving as he did during the difficult years of the war. In 1955, the company lacked office space and needed to buy old houses for renovation. The higher authorities only allocated three thousand yuan. Some cadres in the company were ostentatious and loved extravagance, saying that this amount of money was not enough. Zhang Ziyong was the secretary section chief of the company, and he thought: Spending more money means the state has to spend more. So he went to carpenter Li Yinzhou to discuss how to save money on renovating the office.

He said to Carpenter Li: "National construction requires a lot of money. A country is like a family. If a family doesn't have a plan for using money, if the whole family doesn't save, and spends money recklessly, can this family become rich? Our company is also a small unit of the country. If these small units are all diligent and thrifty in their work and save expenses, of course the state's capital accumulation will increase, and the construction of socialism will naturally be faster!

Under Zhang Ziyong's education, Carpenter Li's patriotic ideology was raised. He discussed ways to save money with the carpenters who came with him, and as a result, they came up with the idea of buying small pieces of scrap wood in the market instead of large pieces of wood from the lumber company. The company adopted this suggestion. This item alone saved more than 500 yuan.

The casings and bristles purchased by the Livestock Products Company are all export goods, and three thousand or so casing wooden barrels and bristle wooden boxes have to be made every year for transportation. In the past, these wooden barrels and wooden boxes were all processed by the company itself in Fuling using purchased wood, and the cost was very high. A casing wooden barrel cost 5.8 yuan, and a bristle wooden box cost 5.7 yuan. Comrade Zhang Ziyong felt that this expense was too large, so he raised this issue at the meeting and asked everyone to think of ways to reduce costs. After collective research by the comrades, it was decided to process them in Nanchuan County, which produces wood, so the cost would be much lower. From October 1954 to October 1956, it had already saved the state 6,000 yuan.

In October 1956, the Livestock Products Company and the Tea Company were abolished and merged into the Agricultural Products Procurement Bureau. Zhang Ziyong was transferred to the bureau as secretary section chief. At that time, the Livestock Products Company still had more than 100 yuan in administrative management fees. Some cadres of the Livestock Products Company believed that this money was accumulated by the Livestock Products Company and should not be used jointly by the Procurement Bureau, and advocated taking it out to buy a batch of new furniture. Zhang Ziyong thought: They are all state units, and if everyone is engaged in departmentalism, it is still the state that suffers. One day, he went to specifically inventory the damaged furniture of the two units. He hired two workers and spent only two days repairing all the damaged furniture, spending a total of three yuan in wages. After the old furniture was repaired, he asked everyone to take a look, and those who wanted to add new furniture were too embarrassed to say anything.

After the two companies merged into one Agricultural Products Procurement Bureau, there were more personnel, and the expenses for telephone and telegrams were very large. According to the financial system, the telephone and telegram expenses for this bureau should not exceed 560 yuan per quarter, but 380 yuan was spent in October alone. Zhang Ziyong suggested to the leadership to take control measures. The leadership adopted his opinion. On the one hand, he announced the telephone and telegram expenses for each section, arousing everyone's attention. On the other hand, he suggested that every comrade in each section should write an outline in advance for long-distance calls and telegrams for urgent matters, and use letters to solve general matters. By November, the telegraph and telephone expenses for this bureau had only spent 190 yuan, a reduction of half. From December to the 20th, only 97 yuan was spent in twenty days.

When I was about to leave the Procurement Bureau, a comrade told me another story about Zhang Ziyong:

In May 1956, Comrade Zhang Ziyong was on a business trip and passed through his hometown—Pinging County, Shanxi. An acquaintance from his hometown approached him, looked at him for a long time, and then greeted him:

"Is that Ziyong, brother?"

"Yes!"

"I heard that you became a section chief, is that true?"

"That's true!"

The acquaintance from his hometown still couldn't quite believe it. His eyes kept turning on him. Everyone looked at his outfit and recalled his past:

Eleven years ago, Zhang Ziyong was a hired farmhand in his hometown, wearing old gray cloth clothes. Now that he has gone out and become a section chief, how come he is still wearing old gray cloth clothes! An old man touched the clothes on his body and said, "Ziyong, those who go out from our place and become cadres come back with brand-new clothes from head to toe, and their leather shoes make a clattering sound when they walk! You, don't blame me for talking too much, you're a section chief now, can you still be the same as before?"

Zhang Ziyong said with a smile: "Have you forgotten? During the Anti-Japanese War, the Eighth Route Army came and went in our place, and the leaders and soldiers all wore the same coarse cloth clothes and coarse cloth shoes. We all praised them as hardworking and simple people's soldiers. Now that we are engaged in great construction, we should maintain the glorious tradition of that era. We should have a simple spirit in revolutionary work, and we should compare ourselves in work, not in eating and wearing. If the work is not good, no matter how well you dress and eat, it is not glorious!"

Everyone listened and agreed with his statement.

    艰苦朴素的好榜样
    黄振祖
    在四川涪陵专区农产品采购局里，人们赞不绝口地向我介绍他们这里的秘书科长张自永同志，说他是一向艰苦朴素的好干部。
    这个参加革命十一年的秘书科长，俭朴已经成为他的习惯。天暖的时候，他老是换穿着两套蓝布制服，洗了补，补了穿，洗洗补补，换来换去，两套衣服已经洗得发白而且补绽叠补绽了。天冷了，他照例地把四年前的旧棉衣、旧帽子穿戴上。他有两双旧胶底皮鞋，不分春夏秋冬都穿着，磨出一个窟窿，补好又穿上了。他在涪陵城里住了四、五年，从来没进过馆子。采购局的房子不够用，他自动把家搬到一个破旧的房子去住，领导同志准备请木匠给他整修一下宿舍，他阻止说：“能住就行啦，能节约的就该节约，咱们现在的生活比起抗日战争时期住窑洞好多啦，比起一般农民的生活，已够幸福哩！”随后，他自己便捡了些木片片堵起房子透风的地方。
    张自永同志不光在个人生活上是俭朴的模范，在工作上他也非常注意节约。
    张自永同志是在抗日胜利那年参加八路军的，在部队里他工作了七年多，从来不乱花一个钱。他当管理员的时候，开支一点钱，他都要打算了又打算。他跟炊事员睡在一起，经常讲节约的故事给他们听，使他们也养成了注意节约的风尚。
    1952年，他转业到四川涪陵专区畜产公司工作，还是一直像战争艰苦年代那样注意节约。1955年，这个公司缺办公室，需要买旧房子整修，上级机关只拨给三千元。公司里有些干部讲排场，爱阔气，说这笔款子不够用。张自永是公司里的秘书股长，他想：多花钱，就要国家多开支。于是就去找木匠李银州商量怎样节约整修办公室。
    他对李木匠说：“国家建设，要花很多的钱。一国就像一家，家庭用钱要是没有一个计划，全家人不节约，乱花，这个家能富裕吗？我们公司也是国家的一个小单位，要是这些小单位个个勤俭办事，节约开支，当然国家资金积累多了，建设社会主义自然就快啦！
    李木匠在张自永的教育下，提高了爱国主义思想。他就跟同来的木匠商量节约的办法，结果他们想出了到市场上去买零碎的小木料代替木材公司的大木料用。公司采纳了这个建议。单这一项就节约了五百多元开支。
    畜产公司收购的肠衣和猪鬃，都是出口物资，每年要做三千来个肠衣木桶和猪鬃木箱来装运。过去这种木桶和木箱都是在涪陵由公司自己买木料加工，成本非常高，一个肠衣木桶要花五元八角钱，一个猪鬃木箱要花五元七角钱。张自永同志觉得这项开支太大了，在会议上就提出这个问题，请大家想办法减低成本。经同志们的集体研究，决定在产木料的南川县加工，这样成本低得多。从1954年10月到1956年10月，已经为国家节约了六千元的开支。
    1956年10月，畜产公司和茶叶公司撤消，合并成为农产品采购局，张自永被调到局里当秘书科长。当时，畜产公司还剩下有一百多元行政管理费，畜产公司部分干部认为这笔钱是畜产公司积蓄下来的，不该放在采购局共同用，主张拿出来买一批新家具。张自永想：都是国家的单位，大家闹起本位主义，还不是国家吃亏。有一天，他去专门清点两个单位的残缺家具，他请了两个工人，只花了两天，把所有残缺家具都整修好了，一共才花了三元钱的工资。旧家具整修好了，他再请大家去看看，闹着要添新家具的人再也不好意思说什么了。
    两个公司合并为一个农产品采购局，人员多，电话和电报费开支很大。按照财务制度，这个局每季度电话电报费不得超过五百六十元，但是10月一个月就花去了三百八十元。张自永便向领导上建议采取控制的办法，领导上采纳了他的意见，他便一面公布各科用的电话电报开支费用，引起大家重视，另方面建议各科每个同志因急事打长途电话、电报都先写好提纲，一般的事，都用写信办法解决。到11月份这个局的电报电话费就只花了一百九十元，降低了一半，12月份到20日为止，二十天只用了九十七元。
    当我要离开采购局的时候，一个同志又跟我谈了张自永的一个故事：
    1956年5月，张自永同志因公出差，路过他的家乡——山西平定县。家乡的熟人走近他，看了好一阵，才打起招呼：
    “是自永哥吗？”
    “是呀！”
    “听说你当了科长，是真的吗？”
    “是真的！”
    家乡的熟人还是有点不大相信，眼珠子老在他身上转，大家看看他这副穿装打扮，回想他的前前后后：
    十一年前，张自永在家乡，是个雇农，穿的是旧灰布衣服，现在出外当了科长，怎么还是穿旧灰布衣服呢！有个老大爷摸着他身上的衣服，说：“自永呀，我们这里出外的，当上了干部，回来浑身上下都是一崭新的，走起路来皮鞋咯咯响！你呀，莫怪我话多，当了科长，还能哪个老样子吗？”
    张自永笑眯眯地说：“你们忘记了吗？抗日战争时，八路军在我们这里来来去去，首长战士都一样穿粗布衣服、粗布鞋，我们都夸过这是艰苦朴素的人民子弟兵。现在，搞大建设了，更应该保持那种年代的光荣传统，干革命工作，该有个朴素劲儿，该在工作上比，不能拿吃穿比，工作不好，再穿得好，吃得好，也不光荣！”
    大家听了，都赞成他的说法。
