    The Glorious Tradition of Hard Work and Plain Living
    Yao Ying
    The glorious tradition of hard work and plain living left behind by the CCP Central Committee and Chairman Mao when they lived in Yan'an constantly educates the cadres, soldiers, and students in Yan'an.

    The Yan'an Agricultural Cooperative Cadre School is located at the former site of Yan'an University. When the school was established in the autumn of last year, due to insufficient funds, not many new school buildings were built, and the cave dwellings halfway up the mountain were not enough to live in. The faculty and staff found a way to vacate seven cave dwellings, solving the accommodation problem for more than seventy students. Cadres and service personnel lived together, and administrators and cooks lived together. Teacher Tang Juemin, seeing that female students had difficulties living on the mountain, voluntarily gave up his cave dwelling at the foot of the mountain to the female students and lived on the high mountain himself. The school lacked teaching aids, so the teachers made them themselves; lacking instruments and specimens, they borrowed them from farms and veterinary stations. The students studying here educate themselves with the good example of the past Yan'an Cadre School students, often using their spare time to repair roads, carry rice, carry flour, and repair desks and stools. Recently, the state allocated 3,000 yuan to the school for repairs, and they dug ten earth caves on the hillside themselves.

    Qingliang Mountain, opposite Yan'an's Pagoda Mountain, was the former site of the Party Central Committee's newspaper, *Liberation Daily*. Now, the staff of the *Yan'an Daily* live here. They constantly spur themselves on with the spirit of hard work and plain living of the former *Liberation Daily* staff. In recent years, the staff of the *Yan'an Daily* have frequently participated in the newspaper's internal production to reduce state subsidies. Recently, the newspaper replaced a batch of new lead type. Originally, they could have hired someone to put it on the type racks, but they rushed to complete their writing and editing tasks and then spent six days doing this, saving the state a sum of money. The comrades in the newspaper office are also very economical with stationery. Before 1954, the editorial department made its own ink for use, like the former staff of the *Liberation Daily*, by buying some purple pigment. The manuscript paper was also always printed on coarser malian paper, and it was only recently changed to snowlian paper.

    The spirit of hard struggle of the Eighth Route Army in Yan'an in the past is also being inherited by the People's Liberation Army now stationed in Yan'an. The barracks they now live in are still the old cave dwellings and old barracks of the former Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin-Sui Joint Defense Headquarters. In 1954, they also gave up more than thirty cave dwellings for use by the local government. An officer of the military sub-district told reporters: Hard work and plain living, diligence and thrift have become a common practice in the army. There has been a surplus in the operating expenses every year from 1952 to 1956. In 1954, they saved a total of more than 15,000 yuan. Originally, they planned to use this money to build an auditorium, but everyone said: "We got by without an auditorium in the past, didn't we? Let's be frugal and wait until the people's lives are better before building it!" Thus, the money was handed over in full. The PLA soldiers stationed in Yan'an also maintain close ties with the local people. Every year, they help the masses with weeding and harvesting crops.

    艰苦朴素的光荣传统
    姚颖
    中共中央和毛主席过去住在延安时留下的光荣传统——艰苦朴素作风，不断教育着延安的机关干部、军人和学生。
    延安农业合作干部学校设在过去延安大学的旧址。这个学校在去年秋季建校时，因为经费不够，没有多盖新校舍，而半山上的土窑洞又不够住，教职员们就想办法腾出七个窑洞，解决了七十多个学生的住宿问题。干部和勤务员住在一块，管理员和炊事员住在一起。教员唐觉民看到女学生上山住宿有困难，便自动让出山下的窑洞给女学生住，自己住在高山上。学校里没有教具，教员就自己动手制作；没有仪器和标本，他们就向农场和兽医站借用。在这里学习的学员，都以过去延安干部学校学员的好榜样来教育自己，经常利用课余时间修路、背米、背面、修理桌凳。最近国家拨给学校三千元修缮费，他们就自己在半山坡上打了十孔土窑。
    延安宝塔山对面的清凉山上，原是党中央机关报——解放日报的旧址，现在这里住着延安报社的工作人员。他们时刻以过去解放日报社工作人员的艰苦朴素作风，鞭策自己。几年来，延安报社的工作人员为减少国家补助，经常参加社内的生产。最近，报社换了一批新铅字，本来是可以雇人摆到字架上去的，但是他们赶着完成了采写任务后，抽出六天时间去做这件事，为国家节省下了一笔钱。报社的同志用文具也很节省，在1954年以前，编辑部用的墨水，还像过去解放日报社工作时那样，买些紫色颜料自己做。稿纸也是一直用较粗的马连纸印成的，最近才换成了雪连纸。
    过去八路军在延安时的艰苦奋斗精神，也被现在驻在延安的人民解放军继承着。他们现在住的营房，还是原陕甘宁晋绥联防司令部的旧窑洞和旧营房。1954年，他们还让出三十多孔窑洞给地方政府用。军分区一位军官告诉记者：艰苦朴素、勤俭节约在军队中已经成为一种风气。1952年到1956年的事业费年年有结余。1954年他们共节余了一万五千多元，原准备把这笔钱建设一座礼堂，但大家说：“过去没有礼堂，还不是一样过去了吗？艰苦些，等以后人民生活都好了再盖吧！”这样，这笔钱就如数上交了。驻在延安的解放军战士们和当地群众也保持着密切的联系。他们每年都要帮助群众锄草、收庄稼。
