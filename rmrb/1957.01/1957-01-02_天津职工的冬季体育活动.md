“Run to Beijing”

    In the courtyard of the Tianjin Knitting Factory, workers run every morning and afternoon as part of a symbolic 120,000-meter “Run to Beijing” competition. The competition started on the 22nd, with over 120 workers participating. By the 28th, maintenance worker Shi Dongtan had already run over 67,000 meters, meaning he had already passed "Langfang," a place more than 100 li from Tianjin, based on this distance. Zhou Deguang, the chief engineer of the factory, also participated in this interesting competition.

Sports Evening

    The Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau recently held a "Sports Evening," featuring a sports photo exhibition, a sports game room, various chess competitions and sports games. A specially invited table tennis team also gave a performance. This lively weekend sports evening inspired workers' interest in participating in sports activities. Subsequently, they held basketball, chess, and table tennis competitions between departments and offices, with over 170 male and female workers participating, accounting for more than 65% of the bureau's total workforce.

Football Movement

    Despite the cold weather, about ten football matches are held every Sunday at the Tianjin Workers' Stadium. Since November, sixty-seven matches have already been held at the stadium. The stadium also organized a "Friday Football Championship and Runner-up Competition" specifically for workers who have Fridays off. After fierce competition among ten football teams, the Huoxing Football Team and the Dachina Rubber Factory Football Team won the championship and runner-up titles respectively a few days ago.

On the Ice Rink

    Since opening on the 15th, the Tianjin Second Workers' Cultural Palace ice rink has received more than 3,100 workers who love ice skating. The Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory and Beiyang Yarn Factory have built small ice rinks, giving workers the opportunity to skate no matter which shift they work. The Tianjin Knitting Factory organized a skating class of over 50 people, who collectively learn to skate every Friday.

    足球运动
    虽然天气很冷，但是每个星期日，在天津市工人体育场都有十场左右的足球比赛。从11月份以来，在这个体育场已经举行了六十七场比赛。这个体育场还专给星期五休假的职工举办了“周五足球冠、亚军赛”，经过十个足球队激烈的争夺，火星足球队和大中华橡胶厂足球队已在日前分别获得了冠军和亚军。
    在冰场上
    天津市第二工人文化宫滑冰场从15日开放以来，已经接待了三千一百多名爱好滑冰运动的职工。天津第四棉纺织厂和北洋纱厂修建了小型冰场，职工们无论上那一班，都有机会滑滑冰。天津市针织厂组织了一个五十多人的滑冰学习班，在每星期五集体学习滑冰。
