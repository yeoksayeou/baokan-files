    Don't Just Look at the Neighbors
    (Vietnamese Proverb) A mother elephant takes a long time to give birth to an elephant calf, but she will eventually give birth.
    * Someone who has slipped on a watermelon rind will avoid a coconut husk when they see it. Living in a pumpkin makes you round, living in bamboo makes you long.
    * Don't just look at the neighbors, don't look at yourself.

    不要只看邻居
    （越南谚语）母象要很久才生个象仔，
  但它终究是会生的。
    ＊被西瓜皮滑倒过的人见了椰子皮也躲着走。在南瓜里度日就变成圆形的，在竹子里生活就变成长形的。
    ＊不能只看邻居，不看自己。
