    Some of My Views on Streamlining
    Yao Guang, Secretary of the CPC Tai'an County Committee	The Number of Institution Cadres is Appalling
    Tai'an County, with a population of over 825,000, understandably has more institutions and cadres, but the number has become shockingly and unreasonably high. The large number of departments, institutions, and cadres has seriously affected rural work. The county Party committee alone directly leads 42 permanent institutions (22 county-level departments and committees, plus 20 districts and towns), in addition to five and a half semi-permanent units, totaling 47. This doesn't even include temporary institutions. With so many departments under the Party committee, it could practically handle the work of the county government, which could be significantly reduced in size. However, the county government's institutions are also astonishingly large. Besides the 62 permanent institutions directly led by the sections, bureaus, banks, institutes, stations, groups, districts, and towns (20 districts and towns, 42 county-level units), there are also 12 semi-permanent working bodies. According to preliminary statistics, the county has over 9,000 people on the public payroll. The breakdown is as follows: (1) Party and mass organizations system: 369 people; (2) Finance and trade system: 4,280 people; (3) Political and legal system: 259 people; (4) Culture and education system: 344 people; (5) Industrial system: 153 people; (6) Agriculture and forestry system: 197 people; (7) Township cadres: 786 people (based on the new establishment after township adjustments); (8) Teachers: 2,680 people. Based on these figures, there is one person on the public payroll for every 90 people in the county. If calculated based on the rural population, there is one person on the public payroll for every 80 people. This means that, on average, about 20 households support one public servant who is detached from production.	Buried in Meetings and Documents
    What are the consequences of this situation?
      (1) Our strength is buried in meetings and document piles. In addition to the monthly (or several times a month) comprehensive three- or four-level cadre conferences, the county Party committee has regular standing committee meetings and secretary office days every week. Temporary standing committee meetings are commonplace. On average, secretaries and standing committee members spend about two-thirds of their time attending large or small meetings. Adding the time spent preparing for meetings, attending meetings convened by departments, resolving temporary departmental issues, and dealing with daily receptions, there is simply not enough time. Consequently, meetings are often rushed. Except for the person chairing the meeting, most people often bring a large number of "side jobs" to the meeting, either reading telegrams and instructions or reviewing and approving documents. Subjectively, everyone is diligent, but in fact, they accomplish nothing on either front (meetings are rushed, and documents are also read superficially). As for documents, besides the telegrams from the central government and the province, there is also an astonishing number of various instructions, opinions, notices, and circulars from all levels, which are impossible to count. Three days away from home means a large bundle. If one goes to the countryside for five or six days, it takes half a day just to sort and classify the documents and look at the titles after returning to the office. Just considering the various publications issued to the secretary personally, they are a tremendous "storage burden." Even if we only count regular Party publications, there are about 22 kinds according to incomplete statistics. Adding more than ten kinds of regular general publications, there are a total of more than 30 kinds. Needless to say, reading all the content, even just looking at the titles and relevant documents, can only be done as a "side job" during meetings.
    Most of the standing committee's energy is spent on meetings to study cadre work, but cadre work is still heavily backlogged.
    According to the scope of authority for managing cadres stipulated by higher authorities, the county Party committee manages about 4,000 cadres. With so many cadres requiring transfers, promotions, education, punishments, pay increases, welfare, and other special issues, the county committee could not handle it even if it studied it all day long. Later, the scope of cadres managed by the standing committee was repeatedly reduced, but still about half of the standing committee's routine meetings are spent on studying cadre issues. One would think this would improve cadre work, but that is not the case. Not only do some departments' cadre issues remain unstudied for months, but the county committee has also never systematically and comprehensively devoted enough time to inspect and study the implementation of cadre policies and political and ideological work. It is simply constantly mired in routine matters.	Business Disputes Have Increased Greatly
      (2) New institutions are constantly being added, each occupying its own territory. Departments often engage in business disputes and blame each other, turning the county Party committee into a mediator. This creates artificial disharmony in work and wastes manpower and resources.
    In the past, the Tai'an County Supply and Marketing Cooperative was solely responsible for ordering and purchasing jute. At that time, there were no major deviations in the supply of fertilizer, loans, advances, and advance sales to jute farmers. Generally, the tasks were completed, and the masses were satisfied. Since the establishment of the County Purchasing Bureau in January last year, the task of ordering and purchasing jute has been transferred from the Supply and Marketing Cooperative to the Purchasing Bureau. When the jute fields urgently needed cake fertilizer, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative proactively and promptly transported the cake fertilizer to the jute-producing areas to meet the needs of the fields. However, the Purchasing Bureau itself had no funds, and the loan quotas had not been approved by the bank. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative refused to sell on credit, and the agricultural cooperatives had no money. In this situation, the lush jute seedlings were about to wither and turn yellow. The jute farmers were extremely anxious, watching the available cake fertilizer but unable to use it. The district committee in the jute-producing area called the county Party committee several times a day to report the emergency. The county standing committee held several emergency meetings in succession to discuss the matter, with representatives from the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the Purchasing Bureau, and the bank participating. After several urgent requests and instructions to the prefecture and province by the Supply and Marketing Cooperative and other business departments, the instruction of "advance fertilizer first, then collect payment" was finally obtained, and the jute growth was not severely damaged. However, the time for applying fertilizer had been delayed by about ten days, affecting the jute yield. The situation was even worse during the harvest. Although the Purchasing Bureau had 97 cadres and 45 workers who were busy day and night, due to the newly established unit's low technical level and lack of experience, numerous problems arose in the grading and evaluation process. During the peak season of jute harvesting, there was also a shortage of personnel, affecting the completion of the purchasing task. As a last resort, the Purchasing Bureau entrusted the Supply and Marketing Cooperative's purchasing station in Manzhuang District to collect jute on its behalf. Mutual support between fraternal departments is a good thing in itself. However, just as the Manzhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the purchasing station were collecting large quantities of jute, with jute farmers from dozens of miles around rushing to Manzhuang to sell their jute, the Purchasing Bureau suddenly protested, saying that more than 60% of the jute did not meet the standards. This alarmed the prefecture and the provincial government, which conducted a thorough investigation. Technicians were organized to publicly discuss and grade 50,000 kilograms of the 200,000 kilograms of jute that had already been purchased. The conclusion was that 90% of it met the standards. Such a wasteful and costly event is just one of thousands. According to the person in charge of the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in the past six months, dozens of large and small business projects have been handed over and received. Several section chiefs and a deputy director have spent most of their time in the past six months on handover procedures, which has become a serious burden. Even the director sometimes has to participate. What are the actual benefits of the handover in terms of business? It has only made the divisions finer, the business unfamiliar, and it is more troublesome for the masses to buy and sell. Therefore, the Purchasing Bureau definitely needs to be merged and streamlined.	Added a Great Burden to Cooperatives
      (3) With more departments, each department has its own business to implement. There are few cadres in districts and townships, so they have to "insert the pole to the end," directly convening meetings of cooperative cadres and activist members to implement policies. This increases the non-productive labor expenses in the cooperatives. The county stipulates that non-productive labor expenses should not exceed 2%, but this is not actually possible. Roughly calculating, in Tai'an County, from late November to mid-December 1956, various county-level meetings required cooperative members to attend, with each cooperative sending 13 people. Averaging 7 days per person for travel, this amounts to 91 workdays, totaling 1,092 workdays per year per cooperative. With an average of 250 households per agricultural cooperative in the county, each household needs to bear 4.4 workdays per year for attending meetings in the county. If the district and township levels hold as many meetings for cooperatives as the county, each household would need to bear 8.8 workdays per year just for attending meetings. This calculation is not precise, but it is not an overestimate. Because the number of people and the time spent by agricultural cooperatives attending meetings in the county from late November to mid-December have been greatly reduced from the original plan.	County Committee Members Have No Time to Go to the Countryside
      (4) County committee members and department heads attend many meetings in higher-level departments. Higher-level departments instruct them on what content to convey to the county committee, when to convene meetings to implement the policies, what level to convene the meetings to, how many people to attend, how long the meetings should last, etc. If there are any deviations in the execution of any aspect, it is difficult to explain. Even if the county committee accepts everything, with so many departments doing the same, it is inevitable that some will not be registered or will not be able to get a slot. Department heads are afraid of criticism from higher authorities and can hardly only care about their own assigned departments. Either way is difficult. Precisely because the county committee is constantly busy with meetings, it often handles the issues that each department should study in a perfunctory manner, failing to strengthen its leadership over the departments in terms of policies and guidelines. The work of the departments also shows a tendency to deviate from reality. All the members of the county committee are in a chaotic state, and the working system is becoming a mere formality. Although Tai'an has formally studied the system of collective leadership three times in the past year and has formally issued documents, it is difficult to implement. Some meeting systems have been adhered to in form, but in essence, formalism is very serious.
    The county Party secretary is "hardworking and conscientious," reviewing "bureaucracy, not going deep into the lower levels, and failing to adhere to the learning system" to the east, and reviewing "only taking care of the center and not paying enough attention to business departments" to the west. What is the right thing to do? It is difficult to find a good solution. During the high tide of cooperativization in Tai'an a year ago, the county Party secretary and committee members went deep into the townships and cooperatives, deep into the masses, to help each cooperative prepare for the establishment and spring production. Until April and May, the secretary and committee members spent about half of their time working at the grassroots level, which was effective. However, just as the spring production campaign was in full swing, various departments of the province and the prefecture convened countless business department meetings, citing the implementation of the Forty Articles as the reason, and several departments simultaneously registered to report to the county committee. In order to arrange the production campaign, the county committee did not meet the requirements of the higher-level departments on time, and several business departments were criticized by the higher-level departments. In order to reduce the criticism faced by department heads in the future, they had to "do less for the center and more for business," "go down less and hold more meetings." As a result, the average time spent in the countryside by county committee members and the secretary in the second half of the year was less than one-fifth. However, the number of people from districts, townships, and cooperatives attending meetings in the county was endless. One propaganda committee member attended meetings in the county for 30 to 40 consecutive days.
    The main force of rural work is used for "meetings," "documents," and traveling back and forth. Very few people help to solve the most pressing demands of the broad masses of cooperative members in a down-to-earth manner. Although there are more than 9,000 people on the public payroll in the county, less than 300 to 500 county, district, and township cadres actually help agricultural cooperatives solve practical problems. Each district has a dozen Party, government, and mass organization cadres, and on average, about one-third of them are constantly rotating in the county for meetings. In early December 1956, district cadres were attending meetings in five departments of the county at the same time. Before the township division, each township had four or five cadres, and on average, about half of them were constantly attending meetings in the county and district. The number of cadres from agricultural cooperatives attending meetings in the county was even greater. Statistics have already been given above. Despite holding so many meetings, many urgent problems in the management, various policies, organization, and style of the cooperative are piled up like mountains. Two Specific Suggestions
    In addition to fully supporting the policy of streamlining institutions and improving work efficiency, we also believe that streamlining documents and meetings should be placed in an important position. In addition, we have two specific suggestions:
    First, as long as there is no intentional "independent kingdom" and "only the center, not the departments," lower-level Party committees can be free from the specific regulations of individual higher-level departments when arranging work. In particular, the "what kind of meeting to hold, how many people to attend, how long the meeting should last, when to hold the meeting, etc." regulations stipulated by higher-level departments for lower-level departments or Party committees should not be regarded as formal instructions and organizational decisions. The authority of lower-level Party committees to arrange work uniformly should be expanded. Otherwise, although the provincial Party committee has formulated measures, if the lower-level Party committees do not properly "close the gates" according to the spirit of the provincial Party committee's instructions, the implementation of the provincial Party committee's instructions will not be accomplished in a short time.
    Second, we must act immediately, decisively, and resolutely, and not just write official articles. After the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee promptly adopted the measures of "launching the production increase and economy campaign and reorganizing institutions." However, many departments are still following the usual routines. Many departments are even taking advantage of the upcoming freezing of funds in December to rush to hold meetings. Ten business meetings, including those for youth, women, armed assistant, agricultural science, procuratorate, culture science, water conservancy science, forestry science, district heads, and technical guidance station chiefs, were held in December. Just considering the county-wide conferences and training sessions held down to the townships and cooperatives, there were 8,949 people in December, and the formal meeting time was 70,660 workdays. Adding the time spent by these people traveling to and from the county for meetings, averaging two days per person, this requires more than 17,800 workdays. The two items combined, agricultural cooperatives throughout the county wasted 88,500 workdays attending meetings in the county in December alone. At a cost of one yuan per workday, this amounts to 88,500 yuan, equivalent to nearly 1.2 million kilograms of coarse grains, a truly staggering amount. If things continue like this, county, district, and township cadres will simply not have time to consider and help with production and consolidation of cooperatives. Most of these meetings were directly and specifically arranged by the various departments of the province and prefecture to the county. Many of these meetings could have been avoided or merged, or the time could have been shortened, but this requires determination to streamline. These views are for your reference.

    我对精简问题的一些看法
    中共泰安县委书记　姚光	机构干部多得惊人
    泰安县，是拥有八十二万五千多人口的大县，机构和干部相应地多一些，是合理的，但却多到了惊人的不合理的程度了。由于部门多、机构大、机关干部多，已严重影响到农村工作。只是党的县委直接领导的常设机构，即有四十二个（县级部委二十二个，另加二十个区、镇），再加上五个半永久性的单位共四十七个单位。其他临时性的机构尚不在内。党委既然有这样多的部门，对县府的工作简直可以包办下来，县府的机构可以大大缩小了。其实不然，县府的机构同样庞大得惊人。除了科、局、行、院、所、站、组、区、镇等直接领导的常设机构六十二个单位（二十个区镇、四十二个县直单位），还有半永久性的办事机构十二个。据初步统计，全县吃公粮的有九千多人。具体分类是：（一）党群系统三百六十九人；（二）财贸系统四千二百八十人；（三）政法系统二百五十九人；（四）文教系统三百四十四人；（五）工业系统一百五十三人；（六）农林系统一百九十七人；（七）乡干部七百八十六人（按调整乡后的新编制）；（八）教员二千六百八十人。根据这个数字，全县每九十个人中，就有一个吃公粮的。如按农村人口计算，每八十多个人中就有一个吃公粮的。就是说，平均二十户左右养活一个脱离生产的公务人员。	埋在会议和文件里
    这种情况带来了什么？
      （一）将我们的力量埋在会议和文件堆里。县委除每月召开一次至数次的全面性的三级或四级干部大会外，每星期有定期的常委会、书记办公日。临时性的常委会是家常便饭。书记、常委平均有三分之二左右的时间参加大会或小会。再加准备会议和参加部门所召开的会议，解决部门的临时问题，及应付日常的送往迎来，时间真不够开支的。因此，会议开得潦草是经常事。每次会议除主持会议的人精神稍为集中外，多数人经常在会议上带着大批的“副业”，不是看电报、指示，就是批转审核文件。主观上兢兢业业，事实上两头无功（会议开的潦草，文件也看的潦草）。就文件讲，除中央和省的电报外，各级的多种指示、意见、通知、通报等文件也是多得惊人，实在无法统计。三天不在家就是一大捆。如果出发到下边住上五、六天，回机关后，只将文件分门别类整理一下，看看题目，就需半天的时间。就拿发给书记个人的各种刊物讲，实是增加了莫大的“保存负担”。只算党内定期刊物，据不完全的统计就有二十二种。再加定期的一般刊物十多种，共有三十多种。不用说全看内容，就是只看题目和有关的文件，也只有在开会时当做“副业”去办了。
    常委的力量大部分用到研究干部工作的会议里，而干部工作却积压得很多。
    根据上级规定的管理干部的职权范围，我县属于县委管理的干部约四千名左右。这样多的干部的调动、提拔、教育、处罚、增薪、福利以及一些特殊问题，县委会就是整天研究也办不过来。后来一再压缩常委管理干部的范围，常委的例会至今仍有约二分之一的时间是研究干部问题。这应该是将干部工作做的好些了，其实不然。不仅有的部门呈批的干部问题数月之久得不到研究，而且对干部政策的执行情况和政治思想工作，县委也从未系统全面地拿出足够时间进行一次检查及研究。只是经常钻在事务圈里。	业务纠纷大大增加
      （二）新机构不断增添，各占一枝，部门之间常闹业务纠纷，互相扯皮，县委成了调处人，工作上造成人为的不协调，劳民伤财。
    泰安县过去对大麻的订购和收购，完全由供销社负责，那时对麻农的肥料供应、贷款、预支、预售、验收等，并没出现多大偏差，一般是完成任务，群众满意。自去年1月成立县采购局以后，订购和收购大麻的任务由供销社移交给采购局。当麻田急需饼肥时，供销社本来主动及时的将饼肥运到了产麻地区，以应麻田需要。但采购局本身没有款，贷款的指标银行又没批下来，供销社不赊销，农业社没有款，在此情况下，肥嫩茂盛的麻苗快要枯黄，麻农看着现成的饼肥得不到用，急的要命，产麻区的区委会一天数次电话向县委告急。县常委为此连续召开数次紧急会议，吸收供销社、采购局、银行部门参加讨论，并经供销社等业务部门几次向专、省告急请示，才算得到了“先支饼肥后收款”的指示，使大麻生长没有受到太严重的损失，但是距适宜施肥的时间已推迟了十天左右，麻的产量受到了影响。收购时更糟。虽有采购局的九十七个干部、四十五个工人，日夜忙碌，但是由于新成立的单位技术低、业务生，验级评价中毛病百出，收麻旺季中人员又不敷用，影响到收购任务的完成。不得已，采购局又委托供销社在满庄区的收购站代收大麻。兄弟部门互相支援本来是很好的事情。但正当满庄供销社、采购站大量收麻，附近数十里路的麻农争先恐后去满庄出售大麻时，采购局忽然提出抗议，说不够标准的占60％以上。惊动了专区和省府，进行了彻查，将已收购的二十万斤大麻中的五万斤组织了技术人员进行公议、评级，结论是90％符合标准。像这样劳民伤财的事，仅是千万件中的一件。据县供销社负责同志讲，半年以来，交出去接进来的大小业务项目数十种，几个科长和一个副主任，半年来的绝大部分时间都放在交接手续上，成了一个严重负担，正主任有时也得参加。交接以后业务上到底有那些好处呢？只是分项更细了，业务生疏了，群众想购买、销售更麻烦了。所以采购局确有合并和精简的必要。	给合作社增加了很大负担
      （三）部门多了，各部门都有业务要贯彻。区、乡干部少，不得已即“一杆子插到底”，就是直接召开社干、社员积极分子会议来贯彻，这就增加了社里非生产性的工分开支。县里规定非生产性工分开支不得超过2％，实际作不到。粗略统计一下，我县1956年自11月下旬至12月中旬一个月的时间，各种县级会议需要社里来人参加的，每社即有十三人。平均来回每人以七天计，即九十一个工，每年每社平均一千零九十二个工，全县农业社平均每社二百五十户，每户每年需负担到县开会的劳动日是四点四个弱。如区、乡两级召开社的会议和县召开的会议相等的话，每户每年只担负会议劳动日的开支即是八点八个工日。这个推算虽欠精确，但不会是过高的。因为11月下旬到12月中旬农业合作社到县开会的人数、时间，是将原计划大大压缩了的。	县委委员没有时间下乡
      （四）县委委员及部委负责同志到上级部门开会很多，上级部门交代了向县委传达那些内容，什么时候召开会议贯彻，开到那一级、多少人数、多少时间等。不论那一方面执行上有了出入，即没法交代。纵然县委来者不拒，但部门都如此，就难免挂不上号、排不上队。部门负责人怕上级批评，又难只顾个人分工的部门。横竖不是。县委也正由于终天忙于会议，对各部门应当研究的问题也往往潦草从事，不能在方针政策上加强对各部门的领导，部门的工作同样出现脱离实际的偏向。县委全体委员乱作一团，工作制度流于形式。泰安一年来虽然三次正式研究了集体领导制度，并正式印发了文件，但执行很困难。形式上有些会议制度是坚持了，实质上形式主义很严重。
    县委书记是“任劳任怨”，向东检讨一下“官僚主义不深入下层，不能坚持学习制度”，向西检讨一下“只管中心，照顾业务部门不够”。到底怎么做对呢？确难有好法子。泰安在一年前合作化高潮阶段，县委书记、委员都深入乡、社，深入群众，帮助各社做建社和春季大生产的准备工作。直到四、五月份，书记委员平均约有二分之一左右的时间在基层工作，收到实效。但正当轰轰烈烈开展春季生产运动时，省、地各部门均以贯彻四十条为理由，召开了无数次的业务部门会议，几个部门同时挂号向县委作传达。县委为了布置生产运动，没有按期实现上级部门的要求，几个业务部门都受到上级部门的批评。以后为了使部门负责同志少受批评，只得“少做中心，多做业务”，“少下去，多开会”，因而下半年县委委员和书记平均下乡的时间就不到五分之一了。但区、乡、社来县开会的却是络绎不绝，有一个宣传委员连续在县参加了三、四十天的会。
    农村工作的主要力量，用到“会议”“文件”和往来跑路方面去，广大社员群众的最迫切的要求就很少有人脚踏实地去帮助解决。县级机关人多不下去，区、乡、社干部上县跑。虽然全县有九千多名吃公粮的人，实际上帮助农业合作社解决实际问题的县、区、乡干部不到三、五百人。每区党、政、群干部十几名，平均约有三分之一，经常轮流在县开会。1956年12月初区干部同一时期在县机关五个部门开会。划乡前每乡四、五个干部，平均经常约有二分之一在县、区开会。农业合作社的干部到县开会的人数更多。前面已有统计。尽管开这样多的会，合作社的经营管理、各种政策及组织上、作风上存在的许多迫切要求解决的问题，却堆积如山。两点具体意见
    我们除完全拥护紧缩机构、提高工作效率的方针外，同时认为精简文件和会议也应放在重要位置。另外有二点具体意见：
    第一、只要不是有意闹“独立王国”和“只要中心不要部门”，下级党委在安排工作中可以不受上级个别部门具体规定的约束，尤其是对上级部门规定下级部门或党委“开什么样的会、多少人、多少时间，什么时间开等等规定”，可以不当做正式指示和组织决定去看待。下级党委统一安排工作的权限应当放大一点。否则，虽然省委拟定了措施，如下级党委不根据省委指示精神，适当的“关闸”，则省委指示精神的贯彻执行，将不会是短时间能办到的。
    第二、立说立行，坚决果断，不能光做官面文章。二中全会以后，山东省委及时采取了“开展增产节约运动，整编机构”的措施。但不少部门仍是一五一十照常规办事。不少部门并借12月份快要冻结经费之机，突击开会。青年、妇女、武装助理员、农业科、检察院、文化科、水利科、林业科、区长、技术指导站长等十个业务会议，都在12月份召开。只就开到乡、社的全县性的大会和训练讲，12月份即有八千九百四十九人，正式会议时间是七万零六百六十个工日。再加上这些人来县开会的往、返时间，每人以两天计，需一万七千八百多个工日，两项合计全县农业社只12月份到县开会耽误工日就有八万八千五百多个。以每个工日一元钱计算，需八万八千五百多元，合粗粮将近一百二十万斤，数目之大，实在惊人。这样开下去，县、区、乡干部根本拿不出时间来考虑和帮助生产整社。这些会议，绝大部分是省、专各部门直接具体布置到县的。其中许多会可以不开或合并召开，或缩短时间，但这是需要下决心才能精简的。这些看法谨供参考。
