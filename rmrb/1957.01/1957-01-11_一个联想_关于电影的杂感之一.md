    A Train of Thought
    Miscellaneous Thoughts on Film, Part 1
    Zibu
    I faintly heard the sound of film gongs and drums from my sickbed, which gave rise to a very wonderful train of thought.

    On the day I left the hospital, the head nurse asked me to criticize their nursing work. When she asked about the hospital food, I replied, "It's very good, especially the hygiene and nutrition." The head nurse smiled very sensitively.

    It is only natural that the food should be hygienic and nutritious. But is it possible to fully satisfy the patient's requirements if only these two are up to standard? From the patient's point of view, he seems to have another requirement, which is: diversification and deliciousness.

    Here, it touches on how to guide the cooks in the kitchen, and what should be the focus of this guiding ideology in a specific environment. The most ideal situation is, of course, to have all three. However, in the specific environment of a hospital, there are conflicts between these three. Some patients can only eat liquid food, and some patients have many taboos on food varieties, so diversification and deliciousness have to be put in a secondary position. Frankly speaking, I also complained about the hospital's food, angrily saying: You only consider a few milligrams of vitamin A, vitamin B, or only consider that a day's food should have several thousand "calories" (heat), without considering the patient's appetite and taste. So, a patient with better self-cultivation retorted, if you want delicious food, go to a restaurant after you get better.

    To lead a certain business, on the one hand, you must be familiar with the unique laws of this business, and on the other hand, you must consider the focus of attention in a specific period and environment. It is undoubtedly wrong to guide the cooks solely from the perspective of vitamins and "calories," but it would be an irresponsible attitude towards the patient to have no opinion and give the patient whatever he wants to eat.

    In the discussion of "Why are there so few good domestic films?", no article criticized the "ideology" of domestic films after liberation. The firepower is concentrated on the monotonous themes and formulaic concepts—in other words, they do not suit the taste. What deserves our vigilance and should be taken as a warning here is that for the past seven years, our leadership of the film industry has been too one-sidedly based on vitamins and "calories," and has paid too little attention to the audience's taste. It should also be said that we have not yet mastered the unique laws of leading the film business very well.

    Here, it touches on the evaluation of domestic films since liberation. To use the above analogy again, even though I told the head nurse "strange things" about the food when I left the hospital, I still have respect and gratitude for the doctors and nurses who treated my food in this way. Because they guaranteed my health, restored my physical strength, and did not cause my old illness to recur due to improper diet. We have every right to ask the comrades who lead the film industry to improve their leadership methods according to the characteristics of the film, and do everything possible to overcome the shortcomings of formulaic and conceptualized ideas, so as to mobilize all positive forces to prosper our film industry. However, it would undoubtedly be excessive to adopt an attitude of completely negating the films of the past seven years and regard the nurses and cooking instructors as "targets of struggle."

    I am fully aware that this association and analogy will surely be refuted with confidence: film audiences are not patients.

    Yes, film audiences are not patients. But looking back at the ideological situation of film practitioners and film audiences in the early days of liberation, it must be admitted that it was quite chaotic and quite seriously affected by some unhealthy ideas. At that time, didn't bad American movies still have a large audience? Didn't many audiences, including Communist Party members, applaud "The Life of Wu Xun" when it was first screened? Wasn't there still much wavering about whether China should take the socialist road or the capitalist road? During the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, didn't it also reflect a kind of fear of and worship of the United States? I think that in that specific period and specific environment, it was definitely correct and necessary to first consider vitamins and "calories" and not cater too much to the audience's taste, with ideology first and artistry second, and it should not be overly criticized. It was not wrong to insist that films serve socialism, and it was not wrong for films to conduct patriotic and socialist education for hundreds of millions of people. If we had not adhered to this policy for the past seven years, if we had not used our "formulaic conceptual" domestic films to squeeze out "rich and colorful" American films, if we had not nationalized the many shaky private film companies that came to the cultural authorities every day to ask for "loans," if we had not carried out ideological transformation and rectification studies for the vast number of film practitioners, then today's "letting a hundred flowers bloom" and "contending of a hundred schools of thought" would not be conceivable.

### 一个联想  关于电影的杂感之一

    一个联想
    关于电影的杂感之一
    子布
    电影锣鼓的声音，我是在病床上隐约听到的，于是，产生了一个很奇妙的联想。
    离开医院的那一天，护士长同志要我对他们的护理工作提出批评，当她问到医院的伙食的时候，我回答说：“很好，特别是卫生、营养”。于是，护士长很敏感地微笑了。
    伙食要卫生、营养，这是理所当然的事情。但是，单单这两者合格是不是就可以完全满足病人的要求了呢？从病人的角度来说，他似乎还有另一项要求，那就是：多样化、美味可口。
    这里，就接触到怎样来指导伙房的炊事人员，和在特定的环境之下，这种指导思想应该以什么为重点的问题。最理想的，当然是三者俱备，但是在医院的特定环境之下，这三者之间并不是没有矛盾的。有的病人只能吃流质，有的病人在食物品种上还有许多禁忌，这样，多样化和美味可口这一条就不能不放在次要的位置上了。坦率地说，我对病院的伙食也曾发过牢骚，愤愤地说：你们只考虑几公丝的维它命A、维它命B，或者只考虑到一天的食物应该具有几千几百个“卡路里”（热量），而没有考虑到病人的食欲和口味。于是，一位比我涵养好的病友反驳我了，要好吃，病好了到菜馆里去吧。
    领导某一种业务，一方面要熟悉这一种业务的特有规律，另一方面也要考虑到在特定时期、环境下的应注意的重点。单单从维它命和“卡路里”的角度来指导炊事员，无疑是错误的，但是毫无主见，病人要吃什么就给什么，那就是对病人不负责任的态度了。
    在“为什么好的国产片这样少”的讨论中，没有一篇文章批评解放后国产影片的“思想”不好，火力是集中在题材单调、公式概念上——换言之，就是不合口味。在这里值得我们警觉和应该引以为训的是七年以来，我们对电影事业的领导太片面地从维它命、“卡路里”出发，太少考虑到观众的口味，也应该说，还没有很好地掌握领导电影业务的特有的规律。
    在此，就接触到解放以来国产影片的估价问题。再用上面的比喻来说，尽管我离开医院的时候对护士长讲了伙食的“怪话”，但是，不管怎样，对于医师和护理员们这样来处理我的伙食，还是怀着尊敬和感谢之念的。因为他们保证了我的健康，恢复了我的体力，没有使我因为饮食不慎而旧疾复发。我们完全有权利要求领导电影事业的同志们根据电影的特点来改进领导方式，尽一切力量来克服公式化概念化的毛病，以便于动员一切积极力量来繁荣我们的电影事业。但是，对七年来的电影采取一笔抹煞的态度，把护理员和炊事指导人当作“斗争对象”，那无疑的是过分了。
    我完全意识到，这一联想和比喻一定会得到理直气壮的反驳：电影观众不是病人。
    是的，电影观众不是病人。但是回顾一下解放初期电影从业员和电影观众的思想情况，总得承认相当混乱和相当严重地受有某些不健康的思想影响吧。当时，美国的坏电影不是还拥有大量的观众么？“武训传”初映的时候不是还有包括共产党员在内的很多的观众的掌声么？中国究竟走社会主义的道路呢还是走资本主义的道路，不是还有许多人动摇不定么？抗美援朝的时候，不是还反映出一种恐美崇美的思想么？我想，在那个特定的时期、特定的环境之下，首先考虑维它命、“卡路里”、不太去迎合观众口味，思想性第一、艺术性其次，应该肯定是正确的、必要的，不该受到过多的责难的。千错万错，坚持了电影为社会主义服务没有错，电影对亿万人民进行了爱国主义、社会主义教育没有错。七年以来，假如我们不坚持这一个方针，假如不用我们“公式概念”的国产片去挤掉“丰富多采”的美国片，假如不把许多摇摇欲坠、天天到文化主管部门来要求“贷款”的私营影片公司国营化，假如不对广大的电影从业员进行思想改造、整风学习，那么，今天的“齐放”和“争鸣”，是不能设想的。
