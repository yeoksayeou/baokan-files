Henan and Gansu Decide to Fully Mobilize the Masses

    (Our Newspaper) Zhengzhou -- After criticizing the neglect of winter agricultural production, most areas in Henan Province have rapidly launched a surge in agricultural production and achieved certain results. However, judging from the overall situation, the progress of the winter production movement is still relatively slow. As of now, only 7 million mu of wheat have been winter-irrigated in the province, and only over 23 million mu have been winter-plowed. Various farmland water conservancy construction and manure accumulation campaigns are also not as good as in 1955.
    The Henan Provincial People's Committee held a meeting on December 27, 1956, and decided to concentrate all efforts to mobilize the masses, rely on agricultural producers' cooperatives, and further carry out a mass winter production movement.

    (Our Newspaper) Lanzhou -- As far as Gansu Province is concerned, there is only one month left for winter production in 1956, and spring plowing is just around the corner. How is winter production and the preparation for spring production in 1957 progressing in various places? The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a telephone conference on the night of December 27, 1956, to check the work in various places.
    According to the inspection, except for the relatively good winter sideline production, the enthusiasm for winter agricultural production and the preparation for spring plowing in 1957 throughout the province is far less than in the same period of 1955. Rural cadres and activists in some places are hesitant and have many concerns. The amount of manure accumulated is also not as much as in 1955, and farmland capital construction has been reduced even more. At the telephone conference, the Provincial Party Committee put forward opinions on production planning and work arrangements to various places, requesting them to immediately organize cadres to go deep into the countryside and agricultural cooperatives, adopt the method of using points to lead the whole area, and help agricultural cooperatives to do a good job in production.

    河南甘肃决定全力发动群众
    本报讯　河南省在批判了忽视冬季农业生产的现象后，大部分地区已经迅速地开始掀起了农业生产的热潮，并取得了一定的成绩。但从当前总的情况来看，冬季生产运动的进展还是比较迟缓的。截至目前为止，全省小麦冬灌才完成了七百万亩，冬耕才完成了二千三百余万亩，各种农田水利建设和积肥运动也还不如1955年。
    河南省人民委员会在1956年12月27日举行了会议，决定集中全力发动群众，依靠农业生产合作社，进一步开展群众性的冬季生产运动。
    本报讯　就甘肃地区来说，1956年冬季生产只剩一个月的时间了，转眼就要进入春耕。各地的冬季生产和1957年春的生产准备工作究竟进行得怎么样？中共甘肃省委在1956年12月27日夜间举行电话会议，检查了各地的工作。
    根据检查，全省除了冬季副业生产搞得较好外，冬季农业生产和1957年春耕生产准备工作的劲头却远远比不上1955年的同期。有些地方的农村干部和积极分子缩手缩脚，顾虑很多。积肥数量也赶不上1955年，农田基本建设更是减少了。省委在这次电话会议上向各地提出有关生产规划、工作安排的意见，要求各地马上组织干部深入农村，深入农业社，采取以点带面的方法，帮助农业社搞好生产。
