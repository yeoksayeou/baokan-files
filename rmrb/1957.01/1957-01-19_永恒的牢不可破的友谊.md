    Eternal and Unbreakable Friendship
    By our correspondent Li He
    The profound, brotherly friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union profoundly impressed people twice on January 17th. The first was the mass rally of friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people held in the Grand Kremlin Palace in the afternoon, and the second was the reception held by Ambassador Liu Xiao for the Chinese government delegation in the evening.

    In the afternoon, the national flags of the Soviet Union and China were hung at the gate of the Grand Kremlin Palace. On the wall of the rostrum in the hall where the Supreme Soviet usually meets, on both sides of the Lenin statue, hung two national flags of China and the Soviet Union. Across the hall, a red banner with the words "Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship and cooperation between the Soviet and Chinese people!" was written in both Russian and Chinese. Before four o'clock, the upper and lower floors of the hall were filled with representatives of Soviet workers eager to meet the envoys of the Chinese people. They were workers from various factories in Moscow, advanced producers, heroes of socialist labor, scientists, engineers, cultural workers, and workers of the Party and the Soviet. The diplomatic corps, the Soviet press corps, and the foreign press corps were also packed.

    At precisely four o'clock, the members of the Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai and the Soviet government and party leaders headed by Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchev appeared on the rostrum. They were warmly welcomed by the participants. The meeting was presided over by Bobrovnikov, Chairman of the Moscow City Soviet Executive Committee. When he extended warm greetings on behalf of all the participants and all the working people of the Soviet capital to the dear guests, and through them to the fraternal Chinese people, the hall resounded with thunderous applause.

    Pilugin, a worker from the electric light bulb factory representing the Moscow workers, Tsirev, a doctor of technical sciences representing the Soviet intellectuals, and Ryazantseva, a female worker from the Moscow Second Clock Factory representing the Moscow Communist Youth League members and youth, spoke in succession. Although the content of their speeches was different, every sentence contained unspeakable friendship towards the Chinese people. They all agreed that the arrival of the Chinese government delegation was a joyful event. They all expressed their joy for the achievements of the socialist construction of the People's Republic of China and the increasingly consolidated friendship between the two peoples.

    One cannot help but be moved by hearing these heartfelt words.

    The Soviet people's love for the Chinese people also ran through the speech of Comrade Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. He correctly estimated that the Sino-Soviet friendship is a great and historically significant gain for the entire socialist camp and the entire working mankind. This friendship is the most important factor for peace and the security of all peoples, and an insurmountable obstacle for imperialism on their path of aggression. When Comrade Bulganin gave a twenty-five minute speech and finally wished for the growth and consolidation of the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people, the audience applauded enthusiastically for a long time.

    The last to speak at the meeting was Premier Zhou Enlai. Premier Zhou's speech was also full of the Chinese people's love for the great Soviet people. Premier Zhou had just flown back to Moscow from Budapest at noon, and Comrade Khrushchev, who participated in the meeting, had also just flown back to Moscow from Tashkent. People had long wanted to hear Premier Zhou's speech. They listened attentively to every word he said in a loud voice. Premier Zhou said that the Chinese people will continue to learn from the advanced experience and advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union as before. The path of the October Revolution is a path from victory to victory, and no force in the world can force the Chinese people to leave this path. This passage gave people a deep impression that Sino-Soviet friendship is truly unbreakable. When Premier Zhou finished his speech, the audience stood up and applauded warmly. When Premier Zhou stepped down from the podium and returned to the rostrum, Comrade Khrushchev and other members of the presidium shook hands with him cordially. The meeting was adjourned. People in the hall continued to applaud and shouted "Hurrah" and "Long live the victory of Marxism-Leninism!"

    After the mass rally, the government delegations of China and the Soviet Union continued to hold friendly talks.

    At more than eight o'clock in the evening, Comrades Bulganin, Voroshilov, Khrushchev and other Soviet government and party leaders and Comrades Zhou Enlai, He Long, and Wang Jiaxiang attended the grand reception held by Ambassador Liu Xiao. The elderly Comrade Voroshilov had also just flown back to Moscow from Almaty and Tashkent today. They participated until the end of the reception before saying goodbye. The reception was filled with Sino-Soviet friendly feelings, which some people felt was as strong as the aroma of the Moutai liquor drunk by the hosts and guests.

    At the reception, Premier Zhou frequently raised his glass to wish Comrade Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Comrade Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and Comrade Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, good health and longevity and greater achievements in their work. Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchev also repeatedly proposed toasts to the health, longevity, and new achievements in the work of Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China, Premier Zhou Enlai, and the comrades of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

    When Premier Zhou toasted Comrade Bulganin, he said: This year is the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Union. The achievements and experience of the past forty years are worth learning from. He proposed to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution here in advance. Comrade Bulganin expressed his gratitude, saying that he would definitely remember his words during the October Revolution Day.

    When Premier Zhou toasted Comrade Khrushchev, he said: Comrade Mao Zedong said that the October Revolution brought Marxism-Leninism to China. The Communist Party of China, under the influence of the October Revolution, learned from the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the actual practice of the Chinese revolution to achieve victory. Therefore, we have achieved victory by following the path of the October Revolution.

    When Comrade Khrushchev proposed a toast to the Communist Party of China and the comrades of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPC, he delivered a speech in which he said: We are in a happy mood now. Today we are simply celebrating the Spring Festival. There is nothing better than to meet people who share the same ideas, talk together, and feel spiritually harmonious. He said: Our views, thoughts, and will are consistent with those of the Communist Party of China. We are all fighting to the end for the complete victory of the cause of the working class and for the construction of a communist society. This makes us connected with the Chinese people through the Communist Party of China. The friendship between our two parties and the people of our two countries is eternal.

    永恒的牢不可破的友谊
    本报记者　李何
    中苏两国人民如兄如弟的深厚友谊，在1月17日一天之内又两次地给人们留下了深刻的印象。第一次是下午在大克里姆林宫举行的苏中两国人民友好群众大会，第二次是晚间刘晓大使为中国政府代表团举行的招待会。
    下午，大克里姆林宫的大门口挂着苏中两国国旗。在平常最高苏维埃集会的大厅的主席台墙上，在列宁塑像两旁，各悬着两面中苏两国国旗。大厅当中横挂着以俄文和中文平列写的红布标语：“苏中两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的友谊和合作万岁！”四点钟以前，大厅的上下两层已经坐满了盼望和中国人民的使者们会面的苏联劳动者的代表，他们是莫斯科各个工厂的工人、先进生产者、社会主义劳动英雄、科学家、工程师、文化工作者、党和苏维埃的工作者。外交使团席、苏联记者席和外国记者席上也是挤得满满的。
    四时正，以周恩来总理为首的中国政府代表团人员和以布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联政府和党的领导人员一起出现在主席台上。他们受到参加者的热烈欢迎。大会由莫斯科市苏维埃执行委员会主席波布罗夫尼科夫主持。当他代表出席大会的全体人员和苏联首都的全体劳动者向亲爱的客人，并且经过他们向兄弟般的中国人民致以热烈的敬礼时，大厅响彻着雷动的掌声。
    莫斯科劳动者代表、电灯泡制造厂工人皮卢金，苏联知识分子代表、技术科学博士齐列夫，莫斯科共青团员和青年代表、莫斯科第二钟表制造厂女工里亚齐采娃先后讲了话。他们讲话的内容虽各有不同，但是每一句都含着对中国人民的说不尽的友情。他们一致认为，中国政府代表团的到来是令人高兴的大事。他们都为中华人民共和国社会主义建设事业的成就和两国人民之间越来越巩固的友谊而表示高兴。
    听了这些心坎里的话，是不能不感动的。
    苏联人民对中国人民的热爱，也贯穿在苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁同志的讲话里。他正确地估价中苏友谊是整个社会主义阵营，整个劳动人类的伟大的具有历史意义的收获。这个友谊是和平和各国人民安全的最重大因素，是帝国主义在它们的侵略政策路上所不能克服的障碍。当布尔加宁同志作了二十五分钟演说，最后祝苏中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊增长和巩固的时候，全场经久不息地热烈地鼓掌。
    在大会上最后讲话的是周恩来总理。周总理的讲话同样充满着中国人民对伟大的苏联人民的热爱。周总理是中午才从布达佩斯飞回莫斯科的，而参加大会的赫鲁晓夫同志也是才从塔什干飞回莫斯科的。人们早就想听周总理的演说了。他们聚精会神地听他以响亮的声音所说的每一句话。周总理说到中国人民和已往一样继续学习苏联的先进经验和先进科学技术。十月革命的道路是从胜利走向胜利的道路，世界上没有任何力量能够强迫中国人民离开这条道路。这段话给人们以中苏友谊真正是牢不可破的深刻印象。周总理的讲话结束时，全场起立热烈地鼓掌。当周总理下了讲坛回到主席台上，赫鲁晓夫同志和主席团其他人员同他亲切地握手。大会闭幕了。大厅里人们还不断地鼓掌，高呼“乌拉”，“马克思列宁主义胜利万岁！”
    群众大会闭幕之后，中苏两国政府代表团继续进行友好的会谈。
    到晚上八点多钟，布尔加宁、伏罗希洛夫、赫鲁晓夫同志和其他苏联政府和党的领导人员和周恩来、贺龙、王稼祥同志都参加了刘晓大使举行的盛大招待会。高龄的伏罗希洛夫同志也是今天才从阿拉木图、塔什干飞回莫斯科的。他们一直参加到招待会结束才告辞。招待会上洋溢着中苏友好感情，有人觉得就像宾主所喝的茅台酒的香气那样强烈。
    在招待会上，周总理频频举杯祝苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫同志、苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁同志、苏联共产党中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫同志的健康长寿和在工作上取得更大成就。布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫同志也一再提议为中华人民共和国主席毛泽东、总理周恩来和中国共产党中央政治局同志们的健康、长寿和在工作上获得新的成就干杯。
    周总理在敬布尔加宁同志酒时说：今年是苏联建国第四十年，四十年的成就和经验值得学习，他提议提前在这里庆贺一下十月革命四十周年。布尔加宁同志表示感谢，说在十月革命节时一定会记起他的话来。
    周总理在敬赫鲁晓夫同志的酒时说：毛泽东同志说过，十月革命一声炮响，给中国送来了马克思列宁主义。中国共产党是在十月革命的影响下，学习了苏联共产党的经验，把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国的革命实际相结合而取得胜利的。所以我们是走十月革命的道路取得胜利的。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在提议为中国共产党，为中共中央政治局同志们干杯时，发表了演说，他说：我们现在心情愉快。今天我们简直在过春节。思想一致的人们会面，一起谈话，并且感觉得精神融洽，再没有比这更好的事情了。他说：我们和中国共产党的观点、思想和意志都是一致的，我们都是为工人阶级事业的完全胜利，为建设共产主义社会而斗争到底的。这使我们通过中国共产党而与中国人民血肉相关。我们两个党和两国人民之间的友谊是永恒的。
