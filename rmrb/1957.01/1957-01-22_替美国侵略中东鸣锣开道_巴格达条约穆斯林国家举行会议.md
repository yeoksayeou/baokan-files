Xinhua News Agency, Ankara, January 21st: The four Muslim countries of the Baghdad Pact held their first meeting in Ankara on the 19th. The prime ministers and foreign ministers of Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, and Turkey attended the meeting. The American and British ambassadors to Turkey attended a banquet hosted by the Turkish Prime Minister for the delegations of the aforementioned countries after the meeting.

Reports indicate that the first meeting discussed Middle Eastern issues, particularly the so-called problem of "communist infiltration."

This meeting is the third held by the four Muslim countries of the Baghdad Pact since the outbreak of the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt. The previous two meetings were held in Tehran and Baghdad. The United Kingdom, another member of the Baghdad Pact and the instigator of the invasion of Egypt, did not participate in any of the aforementioned three meetings.

Upon arriving in Ankara, Iraqi Prime Minister Said told reporters that the four Muslim countries would adopt a unified stance on "the necessity of eliminating communist infiltration in the Middle East." He also reiterated his demand that the United States quickly join the Baghdad Pact.
