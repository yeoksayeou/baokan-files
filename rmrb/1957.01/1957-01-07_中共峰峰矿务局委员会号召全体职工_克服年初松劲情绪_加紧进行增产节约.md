Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 6th – The CCP Fengfeng Mining Bureau Committee, on the eve of New Year's Day, called on all factory and mine workers of the Fengfeng Coal Mine to prevent the emergence of "slackening" thoughts regarding the campaign to increase production and practice economy after the New Year. It urged workers to carry out the campaign in a thorough and sustained manner.

In the month or so before the New Year, the factory and mine workers of the Fengfeng Coal Mine enthusiastically responded to the call of the CCP Central Committee to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy. This resulted in an increase of 1,290 tons in the mining bureau's daily average production of coal mining compared to before the campaign, and a reduction in the cost per ton of coal from 7.5 yuan in November 1956 to 7.269 yuan.

On the eve of the New Year, the CCP Fengfeng Mining Bureau Committee examined and researched the current situation of the campaign to increase production and practice economy. It found that the majority of the factory and mine workers lacked a sufficient understanding of the long-term and regular nature of the campaign. At the beginning of the campaign, they generally considered how to ensure the completion of this year's tasks more, and their measures were more concrete. However, there was little consideration of how to carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy in a sustained manner, and no necessary measures were taken. Therefore, in units that had already achieved some results, there were lax thoughts such as "the task is completed, it's the end of the year." Units with poor results also thought: "1956 is not going to work, 1957 is just starting, let's take it slowly." Some factories and mines even had a "hold back" mentality, believing that the campaign to increase production and practice economy should not be carried out in January. If the cost in January is reduced, the annual targets given by the leadership will not be high, and the annual cost will be "tight."

In light of these ideological conditions, the CCP Fengfeng Mining Bureau Committee called on all employees to oppose complacency and slackness. It demanded that factories and mines that have achieved results should consolidate and develop their existing achievements; factories and mines with poor results should vigorously mobilize the masses to catch up.

In order to ensure the in-depth and sustained development of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the Party Committee also put forward specific measures to strengthen enterprise management and strengthen the leadership of engineering and technical personnel and functional personnel. The Party Committee instructed Party organizations at all levels throughout the mining bureau to use the New Year and Spring Festival period to conduct propaganda and education on "building the country through diligence and thrift," "running enterprises through diligence and thrift," and the consistency of individual and national interests among the vast number of workers and masses.

### 中共峰峰矿务局委员会号召全体职工  克服年初松劲情绪　加紧进行增产节约

    中共峰峰矿务局委员会号召全体职工
    克服年初松劲情绪　加紧进行增产节约
    新华社保定6日电　中共峰峰矿务局委员会在元旦前夕，号召峰峰煤矿各厂矿职工防止新年过后对增产节约运动产生“松劲”思想，要求职工把增产节约运动深入持久地开展下去。
    峰峰煤矿在新年前一个多月的时间内，各厂矿职工曾经热烈地响应了中共中央关于开展增产节约运动的号召，使这个矿务局的采掘产量较增产节约运动开展前的平均日产量提高了一千二百九十吨；每吨煤的成本由1956年11月的七点五元，降低到七点二六九元。
    中共峰峰矿务局委员会在新年前夕检查研究了当前开展增产节约运动的情况，发现各厂矿职工中较普遍地对运动的长期性、经常性认识不足，在运动开始的时候，一般对如何保证本年度任务的完成考虑的多，措施也较具体；如何使增产节约运动持久地开展，则考虑的很少，更没有采取必要的措施。因此，在已经获得些成绩的单位，就产生了“任务完成了，到年底了”等松懈思想；成绩不好的单位也产生：“1956年不行了，1957年才开始，慢慢的来吧”的思想；有的厂矿更存有“留后手”思想，他们认为1月份不能开展增产节约运动，如果1月份成本降低了，领导上给的全年指标也不能高，这样全年成本都会“紧张”。
    根据这些思想情况，中共峰峰矿务局委员会号召全体职工要反对自满情绪和松劲思想。要求已经获得成绩的厂矿，要巩固和发展现有成绩；成绩较差的厂矿，要大力发动群众赶上去。
    为了保证增产节约运动深入持久地开展下去，党委会对加强企业管理、加强对工程技术人员和职能人员的领导等方面，也提出具体措施。党委会指示全矿务局各级党的组织，要利用新年和春节期间，对广大职工群众进行“勤俭建国”、“勤俭办企业”的宣传教育，以及个人利益和国家利益一致性的教育。
