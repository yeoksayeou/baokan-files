Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 12th. The research on the pelvis of Chinese women, completed by obstetrician and gynecologist Ke Yingkui, has brought good news to mothers and babies.

In just over a year, Doctor Ke Yingkui measured the pelvises of one thousand normal pregnant women using clinical examination and X-ray methods. He has made preliminary research into the standard morphology and dimensions of the female pelvis in China and has proposed a relatively complete new method of clinical pelvic measurement for prenatal examinations.

This research is of great practical value for childbirth. Whether childbirth is smooth or not mainly depends on the ratio between the baby and the mother's pelvis. Women of each country and race have different pelvic conditions. However, in the past, China did not have its own standard figures. Therefore, sometimes pregnant women with pelvic problems were not diagnosed and were considered normal, but the result was dystocia. This often put the lives of many mothers and children in unnecessary danger. Through research, Doctor Ke Yingkui found that among the four morphologies of Chinese women's pelvises, the platypelloid type is more common than in Caucasian women, while the anthropoid type is rare. This research result is of great help in diagnosing whether a pregnant woman will have dystocia or a normal delivery.

In order to improve clinical examination methods, Doctor Ke Yingkui carefully measured more than seventy diameters of the three parts of the female pelvis and obtained standard figures. In coordination with clinical examinations, he also sorted out and manufactured thirteen measuring instruments.

The new method he researched will soon be formally adopted and promoted in places such as the Tianjin Central Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital. At the same time, the new measurement methods and instruments will be used. Doctor Ke Yingkui also plans to continue research on various pathological pelvises and other aspects.

    柯应夔完成中国妇女骨盆标准形态的研究
    对诊断孕妇难产或顺产有很大帮助
    新华社天津12日电　妇产科专家柯应夔完成的中国妇女骨盆的研究，给妈妈和婴儿带来了福音。
    柯应夔大夫在一年多的时间里，采用临床检查和X线照相的方法，测量了一千例正常孕妇的骨盆后，初步研究出我国女性骨盆的标准形态和尺度，并且提出了一套较完整的产前检查时所用的临床骨盆测量的新方法。
    这项研究对产妇的分娩有很大实用价值。分娩时顺利不顺利，主要是看婴儿和产妇骨盆的比例问题。每个国家、每个种族的妇女骨盆都有不同的情况。可是我国过去没有自己的标准数字。因此，有时对骨盆有毛病的孕妇诊断不出来，认为是正常的，但结果却是难产。这样，往往使很多母子的生命造成不应有的危险。柯应夔大夫经过研究，发现中国妇女骨盆的四种形态当中，扁型的比白种妇女为多，而男型的则很少。这一研究成果，对诊断孕妇是难产还是顺产，有很大的帮助。
    为了改进临床检查的方法，柯应夔大夫将妇女骨盆三个部分的七十多个径线都做了仔细的测量，得出了标准数字。配合临床检查，他还整理和制造出十三件测量仪器。
    他研究出的新方法最近将在天津中心妇产科医院等处正式采用和推广。同时利用目前新的测量方法和仪器。柯应夔大夫还准备继续进行有关各种病理骨盆等方面的研究。
