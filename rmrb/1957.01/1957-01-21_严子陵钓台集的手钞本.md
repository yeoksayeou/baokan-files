A newly discovered cultural relic:

    The Fishing Terrace at Qililong, Fuchun River, Zhejiang, is where the recluse Yan Ziling of the Han Dynasty tilled and fished. There is no relatively complete historical data about Yan Ziling and the Fishing Terrace. Recently, a long-treasured manuscript of the "Yan Ziling Fishing Terrace Collection" was discovered at the home of Wang Sijing in Meicheng Town, Jiande County, Zhejiang. This book was collected and compiled by Wang Sijing's ancestors over several decades more than forty years ago. The entire book consists of eight volumes, containing a portrait of Yan Ziling, a brief biography, the Eight Views of the Fishing Terrace, and poems inscribed by many poets from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties.

    This book has now been donated by Wang Sijing to the cultural authorities of Jiande County.

    严子陵钓台集的手钞本
    浙江富春江七里泷的钓台，是汉朝隐士严子陵耕钓的地方。关于严子陵和钓台，还没有一套比较完整的历史资料。最近在浙江建德县梅城镇汪思敬家发现了一部珍藏已久的“严子陵钓台集”手钞本。这部书是汪思敬的祖先在四十多年前花了几十年的工夫收集整理而成的。全书共八本，里面有严子陵像、传略，钓台八景，以及唐、宋、元、明、清许多诗人的题诗。
    现在这部书已由汪思敬献给了建德县文化机关。
