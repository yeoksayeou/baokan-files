The heavy snow gave the tall buildings on Binjiang Road in Tianjin a silver coat. At night, the neon lights reflected on the white road, creating a colorful scene. The 123 stores on both sides of the road began to fill with customers buying goods for the New Year. Binjiang Road—Tianjin's most concentrated street of joint state-private enterprises—appeared even more prosperous.

	Only a Year Has Passed
By January 18, it was the first anniversary of the implementation of full public-private partnership in Tianjin's private industrial and commercial sectors. Binjiang Road a year ago was nothing like it is today. At that time, the lights were dim in the evenings, and many stores' shelves were piled not with goods but with empty cardboard boxes. The famous Hanggongqiu Fresh Fruit Store, Dongruixiang Pastry Store, and Yunshang Department Store had already closed down, and many other stores were struggling to survive, with many employees not receiving their full wages. ... But only a year has passed, and the face of Binjiang Road has fundamentally changed. Those stores that had closed down before the joint venture, except for those that were closed due to the need to adjust the commercial network, had long since resumed business, and more than fifty stores in the central area had all been painted and renovated, and some large buildings had been repaired. Many stores have seen their turnover increase by one or two times compared to the previous year. The Wenli Fresh Fruit Store used to sell only two or three hundred yuan worth of goods on an average day in the past, but now it sells about six hundred yuan, and more than one thousand yuan on Sundays. The main industries such as department stores, pastries, cotton cloth, and knitwear are truly profitable for every household.

	Quanye Market is No Longer a "Tiger's Den"
The changes in Binjiang Road over the past year are not only reflected in its prosperity, but more importantly in the profound changes in all aspects of its relationships.

In the center of Binjiang Road, there is a seven-story domed shopping mall building—Tianjin Quanye Market, which was previously known as a "tiger's den." Customers who came here to buy or repair items were often deceived. Over time, people just came to browse and rarely bought anything. This is what the shop assistants called "many people come to the temple, but few burn incense." The current Quanye Market is no longer a "tiger's den" in the eyes of customers, and it has begun to establish a new socialist business ethic.

In July last year, Song Suqin, an old lady from No. 1 Shangjia Hutong, Beima Road, Tianjin, took a diamond to the jewelry counter here to sell. She only hoped to sell it for forty yuan. The salesperson, Huang Pei, saw that the diamond had good color and luster, and its value was more than that. He immediately conducted a collective evaluation and gave her one hundred yuan. The old lady was very moved and praised repeatedly on the spot: "You have been transformed so well!" In the past, when repairing watches, gold pens, flashlights, musical instruments, etc. here, the higher the value of the item itself and the better the customer's clothing, the higher the price would be. The amount of labor and material costs was not the basis for the price. This is no longer the case after the joint venture. Last year, a customer brought in a German accordion worth more than one thousand yuan and asked for it to be repaired. The salesperson, Liu Wengui, opened it and saw that only the reeds were slightly faulty, and the sound was inaccurate. He adjusted it in just over twenty minutes and charged the customer only five jiao. It is believed that this would not have been repaired for less than twenty yuan in the past.

	From Competition to Emulation
Do you know how many "Daoxiangcun" stores there are in Tianjin? Xiangji, Fuji, Jinji, Longji, Chengji, Senji, Linji... a total of eleven. For more than twenty years, capitalists have been competing fiercely for this consumer-favorite brand name.

The competition between Senji Daoxiangcun and Linji Daoxiangcun on Binjiang Road is particularly intriguing. Senji opened first. When Linji opened later, the reason for choosing the name "Linji" was to cut off "Senji"'s head. These two southern-style pastry shops have been engaged in fierce competition in terms of the price and quality of goods, the channels for purchasing goods, publicity to customers, and attracting employees. One year during the Mid-Autumn Festival, the "Linji" capitalist asked the shop assistants to find a rickshaw puller on the street to go to "Senji" to steal a five-liang mooncake for 25 cents, analyze its ingredients, and quickly produce a large batch of four-liang mooncakes, which were sold for 20 cents, and quickly attracted the customers of "Senji." After "Senji" discovered this, they also stole a "Linji" mooncake to analyze and immediately advertised to customers that "Linji"'s mooncakes were short in weight and were deceptive. This kind of capitalist competition did not end until the implementation of full public-private partnership. Now, these two capitalists who used to fight openly and secretly are participating in socialist emulation with the employees. Over the past year, "Senji" and "Linji" have been under the leadership of the same state-owned pastry company, helping each other, improving together, and learning from the advanced experience of pastry shops such as Guanshengyuan. They also introduced each other's goods. When "Senji" did not have a certain product, they would introduce customers to "Linji" to buy it. In the second quarter of last year, "Senji" achieved results in the socialist emulation and was also named an advanced unit in the entire district.

	Working Together Replaces "Disputes"
What is the relationship between capitalists and employees now? We found the answer in the Tianshun Shoe Store on Binjiang Road.

Tianshun Shoe Store is a relatively large shoe store with an attached production workshop, which has been open for thirty years. When salesperson Zhou Hongchun recalled the development process of the labor-capital relationship in this store, he said: Before liberation, the capitalist's desk often had a rattan cane, which was specially used to beat those "unpleasant" employees or those who did not do their work according to his will. Therefore, the employees hated the capitalist very much, but they did not dare to resist, and could only endure it. Zhou Hongchun himself was one who had been beaten. After liberation, the manager did not dare to beat people, but he created a series of labor-capital disputes. Because the leather shoes produced by the store were costly and it was more profitable to purchase goods from outside factories, the capitalist found various excuses and dismissed five employees at once. At the same time, he privately sold leather to make exorbitant profits. This aroused the indignation of the employees, and the labor-capital disputes were not resolved for several years.

Things are completely different after the joint venture. Zhou Hongchun said: "We don't dwell on the past. For the sake of the new enterprise, we respect each other, help each other, and jointly study and improve business management. The other day, we also studied together how to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, tap potential, and increase production."

Why do labor-capital disputes no longer exist after the public-private partnership? Xie Bingchen, the private person in charge of the shoe store, said that in the past, he only knew how to make money for himself and exploit employees. Now, it is for socialism, relying on employees to run the enterprise well together, and the root cause of labor-capital disputes no longer exists.

	An Amazing Change
In the past, capitalists often illegally made exorbitant profits, but the situation is very different after the joint venture. According to the person in charge of managing commerce in the Heping District People's Committee, they conducted an inspection of more than 100 stores on Binjiang Road during the New Year this year, and as a result, they did not find any violations of raising prices, passing off inferior goods as superior, or giving short weight. The person in charge believes that this is an amazing change. He said that in previous years, the government had to organize a large number of people to inspect and manage the market during festivals, but while inspecting, the capitalists violated the law, and continued to violate the law after the inspection. Only with the implementation of public-private partnership today can they truly accept the management and leadership of the state.

    天津一条街
    新华社记者　尹崇敬　黄军
    皑皑白雪，给天津市滨江道上一座座高大的建筑物披上了银色的外衣。入夜霓虹灯光映在白色的马路上，万紫千红。马路两旁的一百二十三家商店里开始拥挤购买年货的顾客。滨江道——天津市这条公私合营商店最集中的大街，显得更加繁荣了。
        时间仅仅一年
    到1月18日，天津市私营工商业实行全行业公私合营一周年了，一年以前的滨江道完全不是像今天这样。那时一到晚上，灯光寥寥，许多商店的货架上堆存的不是商品而是空纸盒。著名的汉宫秋鲜果店、东瑞祥糕点店、云裳百货店等那时已经停业关门，其他许多商店也很难维持下去，许多职工领不到足数的工资。……可是时间仅仅过去一年，滨江道的面貌根本改变了。合营前停业了的那些商店，除了由于调整商业网需要撤消的以外，其他的很早就已恢复营业，中心地段的五十多家的门面全都经过粉刷油漆，一些大建筑物修葺一新。营业额比前一年增加一、两倍的商店很多。文利鲜果店在前年平常每天只能卖货两三百元，现在卖到六百元左右，星期天要卖一千元以上。百货、糕点、棉布、针织品等主要行业，真是家家盈余，户户赚钱。	劝业场不再是“老虎窝”
    一年来滨江道的变化不只表现在繁荣上，更重要的是表现在各方面关系起了深刻的变化。
    滨江道的中心，有一座七层楼的穹窿式商场大厦——天津劝业场，以往被人们称为“老虎窝”，顾客到这里来买卖东西或者修理物件，常常要受到欺骗。久而久之，人们只是来逛逛，而很少买东西了。这就是店员们所说的“朝庙人多，烧香人少”。现在的劝业场不再是顾客心目中的“老虎窝”了，它开始树立起新的社会主义商业道德。
    去年7月间，天津北马路尚家胡同一号宋素琴老太太拿一颗钻石到这里的珠宝柜出售，她只希望能卖到四十元，营业员黄沛一看这钻石光色很好，价值不只这些，随即进行集体评判，给了她一百元。这位老太太十分感动，当场连声称赞：“你们改造得真好！”以往，这儿修理钟表、金笔、电筒、乐器等等，看到物件本身价值越大和顾客衣着越好，要价越高，至于工料费的多少不是要价的根据。合营后不再是这样了。去年，一位顾客拿来一个价值一千多元的德国手风琴要求修理，营业员刘文桂把它拆开一看，只是音片稍有毛病，发音不准，花了二十多分钟就给调整好了，只向顾客收费五角。据认为，这要是在过去没有二十元是不给修理的。
        从竞争到竞赛
    你知道天津有多少个“稻香村”吗？祥记、福记、金记、隆记、诚记、森记、林记…………总共十一个。二十多年来，资本家们为了这个消费者喜爱的字号，竟竞争得你死我活。
    滨江道上的森记稻香村和林记稻香村的竞争特别耐人寻味。森记是先开业的，后来林记开张时所以选用“林记”这个冠号，就是为了把“森记”的脑袋瓜砍掉。这两个南味糕点店一直在商品的价格、质量，进货的路子，对顾客的宣传，对职工的拉拢等方面展开尖锐的竞争。有一年中秋节，“林记”资本家要店员从街上找一个拉车的到“森记”去花二角五分钱偷买来一只重五两的月饼，分析它的配料，迅速制出一大批重四两的月饼，售价二角，很快就把“森记”的顾客吸引来了。“森记”发觉以后，也偷买来一只“林记”的月饼分析，马上向顾客宣传说“林记”的月饼分量少，是骗人的。这样的资本主义竞争一直到实行全行业公私合营才告结束。而现在，这两家明争暗夺的资本家都同职工一起参加了社会主义竞赛。一年来，“森记”和“林记”在同一个国营糕点公司领导之下，互相帮助，共同提高，都学习了冠生园等糕点店的先进经验。他们还互相介绍商品，当“森记”没有某种商品的时候，就介绍顾客到“林记”去买。去年第二季度，“森记”在社会主义竞赛中有成绩，还被评为全区的先进单位。
      共事代替了“纠纷”
    资本家和职工之间的关系现在怎样了？我们在滨江道上的天顺鞋店找到了答案。
    天顺鞋店是一个附设有生产作场的比较大的鞋店，开设已经有三十年。售货员周鸿春追忆起这个店劳资关系的发展过程时说：在解放前，资本家的桌子上经常放着一根藤条，专门用来打那些“不顺眼”的或是没有按照他的意志去做活的职工。因此，职工们对资本家很痛恨，但也不敢反抗，只有忍受着。周鸿春本人就是挨过抽打的一个。解放以后，经理是不敢打人了，但是他制造了一连串的劳资纠纷。由于本店生产的皮鞋成本高，不如从外厂进货赚钱多，资本家就找各种借口，一下子解雇了五个职工。同时，私自去贩卖皮革，牟取暴利。这样就引起职工的义愤，劳资纠纷几年没有得到解决。
    合营以后就完全两样了。周鸿春说：“我们不计较往事，大家为了新企业，彼此互相尊重，互相帮助，共同研究改进经营管理。前两天还在一起研究了如何开展增产节约运动，挖掘潜力，增加生产。”
    为什么公私合营以后，劳资纠纷不存在了呢？鞋店的私方负责人谢炳臣说，过去只知道为了自己赚钱，剥削职工，现在是为了社会主义，依靠职工共同搞好企业，劳资纠纷的根子已经不存在了。
      一个了不起的变化
    以往，资本家们经常违法牟取暴利，而在合营以后情况就大有不同了。据和平区人民委员会管理商业的负责人告诉我们：今年新年的时候，他们曾经对滨江道一百多家商店作了一次检查，结果没有发现哪一家有抬高物价、以次顶好、少给分量的违法行为。这位负责人认为这是个了不起的变化。他说往年一到节日，政府就要组织大批力量对市场进行检查和管理，但是一面检查，资本家一面违法，检查过后继续违法，只有实行了公私合营的今天，才能真正地接受国家的管理和领导。
