Xinhua News Agency, Hailar, January 15th: One of China's largest modern dairy powder factories has been completed. This factory is built in Yakeshi, Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which is rich in milk.

This modern dairy powder factory is one of the above-norm engineering projects built during China's First Five-Year Plan to meet the needs of the people's lives. The factory has main workshops for dissolution, spray drying, packaging, and power, as well as auxiliary workshops for cooling and milk purification. Construction of the factory began in the fourth quarter of 1955 and was completed in just one year and one quarter.

The entire production process of this factory is automated and has excellent sanitary equipment. From raw materials to finished products, the milk powder does not come into contact with human hands, and all pipelines, evaporators, milk pumps, and other equipment that come into contact with milk powder are made of stainless steel. The milk powder produced in this way can maintain its nutritional components, has fine powder particles, and a solubility of 99%, with quality that can reach international standards.

    牙克石乳粉厂建成
    据新华社海拉尔15日电　我国规模最大的一个现代化的乳粉厂已经建成。这个工厂建设在盛产牛奶的内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔盟牙克石。
    这座现代化的乳粉厂是我国第一个五年计划中为适应人民生活需要建设的限额以上的工程项目之一。这个工厂有溶缩、喷雾干燥、包装、动力等主要车间，还有冷却、净乳等附属车间。这个工厂从1955年第四季度开始施工，只花一年零一个季度的时间就建成了。
    这个厂的整个生产过程是自动化的，并且有着很好的卫生设备。奶粉从原料到成品，不和人的手接触，接触奶粉的所有管道、蒸发罐、奶泵等设备都采用不锈钢材。这样制出的奶粉既能保持营养成分，奶粉粉末又细，奶粉的溶解度能达到99％，质量可以赶上国际水平。
    按照设计能力计算，这个厂一天能处理牛奶三十吨，一年可以生产出一千七百六十多吨奶粉。
    目前这个工厂正在做开工生产的准备工作，在今年第一季度即将正式投入生产。这个厂生产的奶粉定名为“友谊”牌。不久以后，这种奶粉就将源源运往北京、上海、天津等地，同消费者见面。
