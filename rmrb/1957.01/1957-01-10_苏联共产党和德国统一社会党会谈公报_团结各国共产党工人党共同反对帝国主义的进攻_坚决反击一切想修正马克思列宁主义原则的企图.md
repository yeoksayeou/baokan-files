Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 9th: TASS reported from Moscow on January 8th that the delegations of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany held talks from January 6th to 7th. After the talks, a communiqué was issued.

The communiqué stated that the talks were conducted in an atmosphere of comradely mutual understanding and Party unity. The delegations of the two parties exchanged views on issues related to the relations between the two parties and the international situation. The two party delegations noted with satisfaction that they had reached complete agreement on all issues discussed during the negotiations.

Both sides pointed out that the fraternal ties between the two parties, built on the principles of proletarian internationalism and equality, are constantly expanding and consolidating. This connection has had a positive impact on the mutual relations between the two countries and has also helped to strengthen the friendship between the people of the two countries.

The representatives of the two parties believe that, whether it is for uniting the forces of peace to ensure peace in Europe, or for the socialist and communist construction in their own countries, it is necessary to further consolidate and expand the friendly ties, close cooperation, and exchange of experiences between the two parties, the workers' organizations of the two countries, and other social groups.

The two sides of the talks believe that recently the reactionary imperialists have been trying their best to split the socialist countries and the ranks of the communist parties, using a new wave of anti-communist hysteria and provocative actions to incite distrust in the policies of the socialist camp, and attempting to weaken the enormous attraction of socialist ideas to an increasingly broad population in various countries around the world. The aggressive blocs hope to disorganize the ranks of the communist and workers' parties, in order to undermine their influence in the struggle to ease international tensions and strive for national independence and democratic rights for the people of all countries.

The two party representatives paid special attention to the revival of West German militarism, which poses a serious threat not only to the people of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, but also to the peace and security of France, Poland, other European countries, and the people of the world.

The participants in the talks believe that, under such circumstances, it is first necessary to unite the communist and workers' parties of all countries on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, and to unite the peace-loving forces in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, to jointly oppose the offensive of the imperialist reactionaries. This requires the communist and workers' parties of all countries to resolutely counter all attempts to revise the principles of Marxism-Leninism. Under these circumstances, it is of particular importance that the communist and workers' parties of the countries in the socialist camp maintain consistency in their views and actions on the fundamental issues of socialist construction. The representatives of the two parties believe that, despite the national characteristics of each country and the specific forms and methods they use to carry out socialist construction, the basic and main road to socialism is common to all countries.

The delegation of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany fully agreed with the position expressed in the communiqué of the Budapest talks of the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties and governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia.

The two delegations unanimously agreed that the two parties will continue to maintain close ties and support each other in the future. This will help strengthen the friendship and cooperation between the people of the Soviet Union and Germany, and will also help strengthen the ties between the fraternal parties of other countries. Both sides will jointly take measures to expand contacts and exchanges in party work, sending party delegations to each other, exchanging party publications, party school students, and experience in trade unions, youth work, and newspaper work.

    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科8日讯：苏联共产党和德国统一社会党两党代表团从1月6日到7日举行了会谈，会谈结束后发表了一项公报。
    公报说，会谈是在同志的互相了解和党的团结的气氛中进行的。两党的代表就有关两党的关系以及国际形势问题交换了意见。两党代表团满意地指出，双方对谈判过程中所涉及的一切问题取得了完全一致的见解。
    双方指出，两党之间建立在无产阶级国际主义和平等原则基础上的兄弟联系正在不断扩大和巩固。这种联系对两国之间的互相关系产生了良好的影响，同时也有助于加强两国人民的友谊。
    两党代表认为，无论是为了团结和平力量来保证欧洲和平，或是为了他们本国的社会主义和共产主义建设，都有必要进一步巩固和扩大两党之间、两国工人组织和其他社会团体之间的友好联系、密切合作和经验交流。
    会谈双方认为，最近帝国主义反动派极力企图分裂社会主义国家和共产党的队伍，借助反共歇斯底里的新浪潮和挑拨行动煽起对社会主义阵营政策的不信任，企图削弱社会主义思想对世界各国越来越广大的居民的巨大吸引力。侵略集团指望使共产党和工人党的队伍陷于紊乱，以破坏它们在争取缓和国际紧张局势、争取各国人民民族独立和民主权利的斗争中的影响。
    两党代表特别注意西德军国主义的复活，西德军国主义不仅对苏联和德意志民主共和国人民，而且对法国、波兰和其他欧洲国家以及全世界人民的和平和安全都是一个严重的威胁。
    会谈参加者认为，在这样的情况下，首先必须在马克思列宁主义基础上团结各国共产党和工人党，本着无产阶级国际主义精神团结爱好和平的力量，共同反对帝国主义反动派的进攻。这要求各国共产党和工人党坚决反击一切想修正马克思列宁主义原则的企图。在这种情况下，社会主义阵营各国共产党和工人党对待社会主义建设的根本问题保持观点上和行动上的一致，具有特别重要的意义。两党的代表认为，尽管各国各有自己的民族特点，各有自己进行社会主义建设的特殊形式和方法，但走向社会主义的基本的和主要的道路对一切国家都是共同的。
    德国统一社会党代表团完全同意保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、苏联和捷克斯洛伐克共产党、工人党和政府代表的布达佩斯会谈公报所表明的立场。
    双方代表团一致同意，两党将来仍将保持密切的联系并且互相支持，这样做有助于加强苏德两国人民之间的友谊和合作，同样有助于加强其他国家兄弟党之间的联系。双方将共同采取措施，以扩大接触和交流党的工作方面互派党的代表团、交换党的出版物、党校的学员和工会、青年工作、报刊工作等方面的经验。
