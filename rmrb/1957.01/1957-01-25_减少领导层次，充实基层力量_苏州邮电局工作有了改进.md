Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 24th: The Suzhou Postal and Telecommunications Bureau has improved its work by reorganizing its organizational structure, changing its leadership's superficial work style. Last year, it won the Jiangsu Province and national postal and telecommunications bureau inter-bureau socialist competition award.

    In the past, the Suzhou Postal and Telecommunications Bureau had many departments, each with several to more than ten functional personnel. Due to the bloated organization and many levels, the leaders were busy with meetings, reading documents and reports, and listening to briefings all day long, and rarely able to go deep into the lower levels. In February of last year, the bureau abolished the functional departments, added twelve postal and telecommunications offices, established some functional personnel as assistants to the bureau director, established a system of the bureau director directly leading the production team and squad, and simplified the reports. As a result, the number of management personnel was reduced from sixty-eight to twenty-seven.

    Due to the reduction of leadership levels, the bureau's leaders directly led and handled the production operations of various departments, went deep into the lower levels, and solved many problems in a timely manner.

    During the reorganization of the organizational structure, the grassroots leadership was also strengthened by directly dispatching many cadres to the grassroots level. For example, the postal section used to have a section chief, deputy section chief, and seven functional personnel. The section also led teams and offices. During the reorganization, the section structure was abolished, and offices were established according to postal services. The two deputy section chiefs served as office directors, directly leading production operations. Before the section structure was abolished, sorting mail often resulted in errors. Although the reasons were checked and analyzed every month, it was never improved. After Shen Yili, the former deputy section chief of the postal section, became the director of the sorting office, he implemented the "sorter carding" and "squad leader collecting card" system, which greatly reduced the errors in sorting mail, targeting the shortcomings in the sorting process.

### 减少领导层次，充实基层力量  苏州邮电局工作有了改进

    减少领导层次，充实基层力量
    苏州邮电局工作有了改进
    据新华社南京24日电　苏州市邮电局通过整顿组织机构改变了领导不深入的工作作风，作好了工作，去年获得江苏省和全国邮电局局际社会主义竞赛优胜奖。
    苏州市邮电局过去科室很多，每个科室都有几个到十多个职能人员。由于机构臃肿，层次多，领导人员整天忙开会、看文件报表、听汇报，很少能够深入下层。去年2月，这个局撤销了职能科室，增添了十二个邮电所，设立了一些作为局长助手的职能人员，建立了局长直接领导生产股，班的制度，简化了报表，因此，使管理人员由六十八人减少到二十七人。
    由于减少了领导层次，局的领导人员直接领导和处理各部门的生产业务，深入下层，及时解决了不少问题。
    在整顿组织机构的时候，由于把许多干部直接派到基层，也加强了基层的领导力量。如邮政科过去有科长、副科长和职能人员七个人，科还领导班和股。整编时撤销了科的机构，按照邮政业务建立了股，两个副科长分别担任股长，直接领导生产业务。在科的机构没有撤销以前，分拣邮件经常发生差错，虽然月月检查分析原因，始终不能改进。邮政科副科长沈以立担任了分拣股股长以后，针对分拣过程中的缺点，实行了“分拣员投卡”和“班长收卡”制度，大大减少了分拣邮件的差错。
