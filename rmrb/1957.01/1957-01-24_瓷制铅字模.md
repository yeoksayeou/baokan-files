    Porcelain Type Molds
    Recently, Lei Yuping, a type-casting worker at the Pingxiang Newspaper Printing Factory in Jiangxi, successfully trial-produced a type of porcelain mold that can replace copper molds for casting lead type. The characters cast with it are clear in stroke and free from blemishes or pitting.
    Using copper for lead type molds is costly; at the same time, if copper molds are used or stored for too long, the lead type cast from them is prone to pitting. The porcelain mold that has now been successfully trial-produced is made of fine porcelain clay that is resilient and fire-resistant, formed into a model and fired in a kiln at a high temperature of 1300 degrees Celsius. It is tough and not brittle, and can withstand mechanical pressure; its cost is only 10% of that of copper molds. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    瓷制铅字模
    一种可以代替铜模铸铅字的瓷模，最近由江西萍乡报印刷厂铸字工人雷雨平试制成功。用它铸出来的字，笔划清晰，不花不麻。
    用铜做铅字模，成本昂贵；同时，铜模使用或存放时间过长，铸出来的铅字容易有麻面。这次试制成的瓷模是用细致的富有韧性和耐火性能的瓷土做成模型，在窑中经摄氏一千三百度的高温烧成。它坚韧不脆，能承受机械压力；成本只及铜模的10％。　（据新华社讯）
