Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, January 15th: Since the beginning of winter, agricultural cooperatives in the disaster areas of Henan Province have earned more than 60 million yuan from sideline production. This is one of the great advantages demonstrated by agricultural cooperatives in production and disaster relief efforts.

Last year, some areas of Henan Province suffered continuous flooding, with over 50 million mu of farmland flooded in the summer and autumn seasons, making it the most severe disaster since liberation. However, agricultural cooperatives demonstrated tremendous strength in the fight against the disaster. After being hit by the disaster last autumn, agricultural cooperatives in the disaster areas generally managed to achieve "five without delays": harvesting autumn crops, planting wheat, repairing flooded and collapsed houses, collecting livestock fodder, and engaging in sideline production. Since August of last year, the disaster areas of Henan have repaired 600,000 flooded and collapsed houses. Thanks to the 7.53 million mu of late autumn crops that the cooperatives rushed to plant after the disaster last autumn, yielding 220 million jin of grain, 300 million jin of sweet potatoes, and 8.2 billion jin of vegetables, coupled with a large amount of collected dried vegetables (generally reaching 30 jin per person) and the state's allocation of large quantities of grain support, the food difficulties of farmers in the disaster areas have been basically resolved. The cooperatives extracted labor to collect and store over 1.8 billion jin of livestock fodder, basically solving the difficulty of livestock fodder that had been difficult to solve in the disaster areas over the years. At present, the wheat in the disaster areas throughout the province is generally growing vigorously.

Changsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Junxian County, which suffered heavy losses last year, summarized the five major advantages of advanced cooperatives in overcoming disasters: First, they preserved livestock. In 1955, when farming individually, 334 heads of livestock were sold off or died due to the disaster. In 1956, the entire cooperative did not sell or lose a single head of livestock. Second, in 1955, when planting wheat after the disaster, only 1,000 mu of wheat fields were deep-plowed before sowing because people were only concerned with engaging in sideline production to earn a living. In 1956, 5,000 mu of wheat were deep-plowed before sowing. Third, 851 flooded and damaged houses were repaired, ensuring that all cooperative members had housing after the disaster. Fourth, 1.62 million jin of green vegetables were harvested, increasing confidence in weathering the famine. Fifth, before November, the cooperative had already earned 7,983 yuan from sideline production, solving the temporary difficulties of the members.

At present, production activities in the disaster areas throughout the province are continuing to move towards a climax. The vast majority of the masses are in high spirits for production. According to statistics, in 60% of the areas, more than half of the labor force is participating in sideline activities, and 3 million laborers throughout the disaster areas are participating in various production activities every day.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, January 14th: Eleven counties in the central plains of Jilin Province that suffered severe waterlogging last year have generated an income of 28 million yuan by early January through the vigorous organization of sideline production and the implementation of production-based self-relief by agricultural cooperatives. In many heavily affected cooperatives in Lishu, Yushu, Changling, and other counties, each member has earned 30 to 100 yuan from sideline production. Some agricultural cooperatives that could only distribute a few jin of sorghum per labor day can now distribute six or seven jiao, and the food ration problem has been basically resolved.

In organizing production and disaster relief, agricultural cooperatives in various regions generally make plans for the use of agricultural and sideline labor, ensuring that agricultural and sideline production are not neglected. According to statistics, since last winter, these eleven counties alone have had 110,000 people participating in clearing forest farms and building water conservancy projects and highways through work-for-relief programs. At the same time, preparations for spring plowing have also been successful. According to statistics from only five counties, including Nong'an, 40 billion jin of fodder for spring use has already been prepared. Heavily affected cooperatives in Lishu County have also accumulated a lot of manure. After the disaster, the members were worried that they would not be able to plant this year, but now they are relieved.

In disaster relief efforts, in addition to organizing sideline production operated by the cooperative, agricultural cooperatives also help members arrange household sideline businesses. The personal sideline income of cooperative members in various regions accounts for about 40% of the total sideline income. On the highways of Dehui, Yushu, and other counties, agricultural cooperatives' carts are flowing endlessly, loaded with sorghum stalks, willow branches, and other raw materials for sideline production, as well as grass bags, mats, frozen fish, and animal skins. These are all purchased and sold by the agricultural cooperatives on behalf of the members, saving the members a lot of trouble. The agricultural cooperatives of Shuangyu Township in Yushu County once bought back 15,000 jin of sorghum stalks from dozens of miles away and distributed them to the members, solving the problem of lack of weaving materials.

    农业社在抗灾中显出巨大优越性
    河南吉林灾区入冬以来副业收入约达九千万元
    新华社郑州15日电　入冬以来，河南省灾区的农业社开展副业生产已经收入了六千多万元。这是农业社在生产救灾工作中显示出来的巨大优越性之一。
    去年河南省部分地区曾连续遭受水灾，夏秋两季全省被淹农田共达五千多万亩，是解放后灾情最重的一年。但农业社在抗灾斗争上表现了巨大的力量。灾区的农业社，在去年秋天受灾以后，普遍做到了收秋、种麦、修盖被淹倒塌的房屋，采集牲口饲草和进行副业生产等“五不误”。自去年8月以来，河南灾区已经先后修盖被淹倒塌的房屋六十万间。由于去秋各社在灾后抢种了晚秋作物七百五十三万亩，共收获粮食两亿两千万斤，红芋三亿斤，蔬菜八十二亿斤，加上大量采集干菜（一般已经达到每人三十斤），和国家调运大批粮食支援，灾区农民吃的困难已经基本上解决了。各社抽出劳动力采集和储备了牲畜饲草十八亿多万斤，基本上解决了被灾地区历年来不容易解决的牲畜饲草的困难。目前，全省灾区的小麦普遍生长旺盛。
    浚县去年受灾很重的长胜农业社，总结出了高级社战胜灾荒的五大优越性：一、保住了牲畜，1955年单干时，因为遭灾，卖出和死掉牲口三百三十四头；而1956年全社牲口一头没卖，也没死。二、1955年灾后种麦时因为只顾搞副业赚钱糊口，在播种前进行过深耕的麦田只有一千亩；1956年五千亩小麦在播种前都进行了深耕。三、修盖被淹坏的房屋八百五十一间，使全社社员灾后都有房屋住。四、收青菜一百六十二万斤，增加了度荒信心。五、在11月份前，全社副业收入已有七千九百八十三元，解决了社员的临时困难。
    目前全省灾区生产活动正在继续走向高潮。绝大部分地区群众生产情绪高涨。据统计，有60％的地区有一半以上的劳力参加副业活动，全省灾区每天参加各项生产的劳力有三百万人。
    新华社长春14日电　吉林省中部平原去年遭受严重涝灾的十一个县，经农业社大力组织副业生产，开展生产自救以后，到1月上旬已经收入两千八百万元。梨树、榆树、长岭等县许多重灾社，每个社员已经从副业生产中收入三十元到一百元。有些农业社原来每个劳动日只能分几斤高粱，现在已能分到六、七角钱，口粮问题基本解决。
    各地农业社在组织生产救灾工作中，一般都做好农业和副业劳力使用规划，做到农副业生产两不误。据统计，这十一个县从去冬以来，仅参加清理林场和以工代赈修筑水利工程和公路的就有十一万人。同时，备耕工作也获得了成就。仅据农安等五个县统计，就已经准备好春季用的饲草四百亿斤。梨树县重灾社还攒了许多粪肥，受灾以后，社员曾经担心今年种不上地，现在都放心了。
    在救灾工作中，农业社除了组织由社经营的副业生产以外，还帮助社员安排家庭副业。各地农业社社员个人副业收入约占到副业总收入40％。德惠、榆树等县的公路上，农业社大车川流不息，满载着秫秸、柳条等副业生产原料和草袋、席子、冻鱼、兽皮等产品。这些都是农业社代替社员采购和推销的，社员省去不少麻烦。榆树县双鱼乡各农业社曾经从几十里外买回了一万五千斤秫秸，分给社员，解决了缺乏编织原料的问题。
