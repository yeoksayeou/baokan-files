    Greening Railway Trunk Lines
    (Our report) Last year, over 13.82 million trees were planted along the national railway trunk lines, exceeding the plan by over 1.83 million trees.
    Currently, green belts have been planted along both sides of more than 6,300 kilometers of railways on the Beijing-Shenyang, Harbin-Dalian, Tianjin-Pukou, Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Guangdong-Hankou, Beijing-Hankou, and Longhai lines. Windbreak forests, totaling approximately 180 kilometers in length, have been created between Zhangwu and Er'xiang on the Dazheng Line, between Minquan and Kaifeng on the Longhai Line, and in areas such as Beidaihe and Weishanzhuang on the Beijing-Shanhaiguan Line. In some areas of the Muling-Jiamusi and Nenjiang-Bei'an lines, 98 kilometers of snowbreak forests have been created. In some areas of the Changchun-Tumen line, over 3,000 hectares of water conservation forests have been created. Large-scale afforestation not only beautifies the lines but also plays an active role in preventing natural disasters and protecting the lines. In some areas of the Dazheng Line, where strong winds and sandstorms used to frequently bury the tracks, the damage from wind and sand has been greatly reduced after the construction of windbreak forests. On the Muling-Jiamusi Line, where snow burial often disrupted traffic in severe winter, snow disasters have been basically eliminated after the construction of snowbreak forests. After many slopes on the Guangdong-Hankou and Baoji-Lanzhou lines were covered with turf, landslides and mudflows were effectively prevented, saving the cost of maintaining slope engineering.

    绿化铁路干线
    本报讯　去年一年中全国铁路干线营造绿化林一千三百八十二万多株，比计划多一百八十三万多株。
    目前，在京沈、哈大、津浦、沪宁、沪杭、浙赣、粤汉、京汉、陇海等干线上，共有六千三百多公里线路的两侧种上绿化林。在大郑线彰武到阿尔乡间，陇海线民权到开封间以及京山线北戴河、魏善庄等处，已营造了共长约一百八十公里的防砂林；在牡佳线和宁嫩线的一些地区，已营造九十八公里防雪林；在长图线的一些地区营造了三千多公顷的防水林。大规模绿化造林，不仅美化了线路，还在防止自然灾害、保护线路方面发挥了积极作用。大郑线的一些地区过去大风砂常常埋没线路，经过营造防砂林以后，风砂的灾害大为减轻；牡佳线过去在严冬季节常常雪埋线路而阻断行车，营造了防雪林以后，已基本上消灭了雪灾。粤汉、宝兰等线的许多边坡铺植了草皮以后，也有效地防止了坍方流泥，节省了维修边坡工程的费用。
