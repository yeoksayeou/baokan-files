Editorial:

    On January 5th, U.S. President Eisenhower, in a special joint session of both houses of Congress, presented a special message regarding U.S. policy towards the Middle East. This message, before being submitted to Congress, was said to have been revised twelve times, but the basic content remained the same as what had been revealed earlier, mainly including two points: first, to authorize the President to implement a "military assistance and cooperation program" in the Middle East, and to use U.S. armed forces to "protect" the "independence" of Middle Eastern countries; second, to authorize the President to provide economic "aid" to Middle Eastern countries, with an additional $200 million per year in "free disposal" for the next two years in the region. The U.S. propaganda machine has been vigorously hyping this so-called "bold and imaginative" plan as the "Eisenhower Doctrine."
    Like the "Truman Doctrine," the "Eisenhower Doctrine" brandishes the black flag of anti-Soviet and anti-communist, and describes its plan as being for the purpose of "protecting" Middle Eastern countries and to "counter" Soviet "aggression." This is utter nonsense!
    Who exactly is aggressing against the Middle East? Who are the true friends of the people of the Middle Eastern countries, and who are their enemies? The people of the Middle Eastern countries, who have waged a long struggle to win and defend national independence, are not difficult to make a judgment. For the thirty-nine years since the founding of the Soviet Union, it has always respected the independent sovereignty of Middle Eastern countries and has always advocated peaceful coexistence with all countries. It has not a single soldier or base in the Middle East, has not organized any military blocs, and has not plundered a single drop of oil from Middle Eastern countries! However, the Western colonial powers are not like this. They began their history of conquering the Middle East with fire and sword more than a hundred years ago. After World War II, the United States announced the "Truman Doctrine" and also massively invaded the Middle East. Western colonial countries occupy land in the Middle East, plunder resources, create coups, practice "power politics," and compete for spheres of influence, even launching armed aggression. We ask, what exactly is the United States trying to "protect"? Why, when Britain and France attacked Egypt, when Egypt's independence was seriously violated, and when the Egyptian people were massacred and their blood stained Port Said red, did the United States not "protect" them? Why did the United States brazenly refuse when the Soviet Union proposed a joint military intervention to stop the Anglo-French aggression? In the face of these facts, how can the United States still sing high-sounding praises of "protecting" the "independence" of Middle Eastern countries?
    The "Eisenhower Doctrine" also raises another banner, called "filling the power vacuum." According to this "theory," because the British and French aggressors have been driven away, a "power vacuum" has appeared in the Middle East, and this "power vacuum" must be "filled" by the "military and economic power" of the United States. It is said that this is America's "responsibility"! In the past, Hitler invented the theory of "living space," still pretending that it was for the "survival" of the Aryan race that it seemed necessary to expand outwards. But today, the inventors of the "power vacuum" theory are even more absurd and arrogant. They regard other people's territory as a "no man's land" and openly declare that it should be ruled by the United States, and Dulles even shamelessly calls this behavior "serving others." The shamelessness of the American aggressors has exceeded Hitler's "imagination" in those years!
    However, shouting about "countering Soviet aggression" and preaching "filling the power vacuum" cannot conceal the essence of the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" is actually an ambitious colonialism with the threat of force as its main means. Now that the war of British and French aggression against Egypt has just stopped, and peace in the Middle East has not yet been fully restored, yet according to the "Eisenhower Doctrine," the United States, under the pretext of "protection," can carry out military provocations, armed intervention, and even launch wars of aggression on the land of any Middle Eastern country at any time. Therefore, Dulles called this practice "America's prior declaration of its determination to fight," and also called it "a policy of fighting when we must fight." U.S. officials also believe that the Middle East, like Taiwan, is "very important" to the United States, so it must "defend" the Middle East in the same way as it "defends" Taiwan. It is clear that the "protection" of the "independence" of Middle Eastern countries that the United States speaks of is merely a synonym for the armed occupation of the Middle East by the United States.
    While announcing a policy of armed intervention, the "Eisenhower Doctrine" also announced an economic "aid" plan, which is obviously another deceptive trick. In fact, the United States has never been concerned about the economic development of Middle Eastern countries. What it cares about is how to extract more oil, more sweat and blood, and more profits from the Middle East. If the United States is sincerely willing to help Middle Eastern countries develop their own economies, then why did the United States suddenly withdraw its loan for the Aswan High Dam project when Egypt needed help? Why, when Egypt was in its most difficult time, did the United States instead freeze Egypt's $40 million in assets in the United States, and has not yet lifted the freeze? In fact, the $400 million that the United States is preparing to "aid" Middle Eastern countries, as it itself has promoted, is only used as an "economic force" to cooperate with its "military force" to "fill the power vacuum" in order to expand its own colonial power in the Middle East.
    It is certainly not accidental that the United States chose this moment to release this poisonous arrow of the "Eisenhower Doctrine." In recent years, the movement for national independence and the trend towards peace and neutrality in the Middle East have been growing. Egypt's just act of nationalizing the Suez Canal Company was a major development in this movement. The British and French colonialists launched a war of aggression against Egypt in order to block this movement and maintain their colonialist positions, but they failed. This has further disintegrated the imperialist colonial system. The United States is most afraid of this situation, because the United States is the largest colonial country today and the last bastion of the colonial system. It has cast aside all its masks of "peace" and "anti-colonialism" and is determined to suppress the Middle Eastern national independence movement and attempt to maintain the increasingly unpopular Baghdad Pact, intensify divisions and tensions among Middle Eastern countries, in order to continue to pursue its policy of strength in the Middle East. At the same time, the United States sees that the British and French colonialists have lost their overall position in the Middle East, so it wants to take the opportunity to enter and replace them with American colonial rule. The British are acutely aware of this. The London "Sunday Telegraph" said that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is intended to enable "the United States to take over the leadership of the West in the Middle East from Britain." Therefore, the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine," specifically speaking, is the United States' arrogant colonialist plan to dominate the Middle East.
    The U.S. ruling group is so carried away that they think they have encountered a good opportunity for the United States to realize this arrogant plan. But their calculation is wrong. In the 1950s, in this era of universal awakening of oppressed nations, the colonialists' good opportunities are gone forever. As soon as the "Eisenhower Doctrine" appeared, it was fiercely attacked by the people of the Middle East and the people of Asia and Africa. The people of the Middle East, who have suffered from the disasters of colonialism and love freedom, understand that they have just driven away the wolf of British and French colonialists, and they certainly do not want to let the tiger of American colonialists come in again. The people of Middle Eastern countries demand independence and freedom, demand to be the masters of their own countries, demand to build their own lives in their own way, and demand to step onto the international stage with an independent and autonomous posture. Neither British and French colonialists nor American colonialists can stop this historical process. The Middle East should be the Middle East of the Middle Eastern countries. The "Eisenhower Doctrine" is destined to be "filled" into the grave of colonialism!

### 评“艾森豪威尔主义”

    评“艾森豪威尔主义”
    1月5日，美国总统艾森豪威尔在国会两院特别联席会上，提出了美国对中东政策的特别咨文。这个咨文在向国会提出以前，据说已修改过十二遍，但基本内容仍同早已透露出来的一样，主要包括两点：一是授权总统在中东实行“军事援助和合作计划”，并且为了“保护”中东国家的“独立”可以使用美国武装部队；一是授权总统对中东国家给予经济“援助”，在今后两年内每年在这个地区额外“自由支配”二亿美元。美国宣传机关一直大吹大擂，把这个所谓“大胆而富有想像力的”计划叫做“艾森豪威尔主义”。
    和“杜鲁门主义”一样，“艾森豪威尔主义”打出反苏反共的黑色旗帜，把自己的计划说成是为了“保护”中东国家，为了“对付”苏联的“侵略”。这真是胡言乱语！
    究竟是谁在侵略中东呢？究竟谁是中东各国人民的真实朋友，谁是中东各国人民的敌人呢？曾经为了争取和保卫民族独立而进行过长期斗争的中东各国人民，是不难作出判断的。苏联立国三十九年以来，一直尊重中东国家的独立主权，一直主张同一切国家和平相处。它在中东没有一兵一卒，没有一个基地，没有组织任何军事集团，没有掠夺过中东国家的一滴石油！但是，西方殖民国家却不是这样，它们在一百多年以前就开始了它们征服中东的火与剑的历史。第二次世界大战以后，美国宣布了“杜鲁门主义”，也大规模地侵入了中东。西方殖民国家在中东侵占土地，掠夺资源，制造政变，实行“强权政治”，争夺势力范围，直到发动武装侵略。试问，美国要“保护”的究竟是什么？为什么当英法进攻埃及，当埃及的独立受到严重侵犯，当埃及人民被屠杀、鲜血染红了塞得港的时候，美国不去“保护”呢？为什么当苏联建议共同出兵制止英法侵略行动的时候，美国又悍然加以拒绝呢？在这些事实面前，美国怎么还能够高唱“保护”中东国家“独立”呢？
    “艾森豪威尔主义”还打出了另一面旗帜，叫做“填补势力真空”。按照这个“理论”，由于英法侵略者被赶走了，中东就出现了“势力真空”，而这个“势力真空”又必须由美国的“军事力量和经济力量”来“填补”，据说这是美国的“责任”！从前，希特勒发明的“生存空间”论，还是装作为了阿利安种人的“生存”似乎不得不对外扩张的样子。而今天，“势力真空”论的发明者却更加荒唐，更加狂妄了。他们把别人的国土看作是“无人之境”，公然宣布应该由美国来统治，而且杜勒斯还大言不惭地把这种行为说成是“为别人服务”。美国侵略者的无耻程度已经超出了当年希特勒的“想像力”！
    可是，叫喊“对付苏联侵略”，宣扬“填补势力真空”，并不能掩盖“艾森豪威尔主义”的实质。所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”实际上就是以武力威胁为主要手段的野心勃勃的殖民主义。现在英法侵略埃及的战争刚刚停止，中东的和平还没有完全恢复，可是按照“艾森豪威尔主义”，美国借口“保护”，却可以在任何时候，在任何中东国家的土地上进行军事挑衅，武装干涉，以至发动侵略战争。所以杜勒斯把这种做法叫做“美国事先宣布决心战斗”，又叫做“我们必须打时就打的政策”。美国官员们并且认为中东和台湾一样，对美国“非常重要”，所以要和“保卫”台湾一样地“保卫”中东。可见美国所说的“保护”中东国家的“独立”，不过是美国武力侵占中东的代名词。
    “艾森豪威尔主义”宣布武力干涉政策的同时，又宣布了经济“援助”计划，这显然又是一个骗人的把戏。事实上，美国从来也不曾关心中东国家经济的发展。它所关心的只是如何从中东榨取更多的石油，更多的血汗，更多的利润。如果美国真心愿意帮助中东国家发展自己的经济，那么为什么在埃及需要帮助的时候，美国突然撤回了对阿斯旺高水坝工程的贷款？为什么在埃及最困难的时候，美国反而冻结了埃及在美国的四千万美元的资产，而至今还没有解除？其实，美国准备“援助”中东国家的四亿美元，正如它自己所宣传的，只是作为一种“经济力量”，配合着它的“军事力量”，来“填补势力真空”，以便在中东扩张美国自己的殖民势力。
    美国选择这个时机放出了这枝“艾森豪威尔主义”的毒箭，当然也不是偶然的。近些年来，中东民族独立运动和和平中立的趋势日益增长。埃及把苏伊士运河公司收归国有的正义行动就是这个运动的一个重大发展。英法殖民者为了阻挡这个运动，维持殖民主义阵地，发动了侵埃战争，但结果却失败了。这使得帝国主义殖民体系进一步瓦解了。对于这种形势感到最大的恐惧的是美国，因为美国是今天最大的殖民国家，是殖民制度的最后的堡垒。它抛开了一切“和平”、“反殖民主义”的假面具，决心出来镇压中东民族独立运动，并企图维系日益不得人心的巴格达条约，加剧中东国家之间的分裂和紧张局势，以便继续在中东推行实力政策。同时，美国看到英法殖民者在中东的大势已去，就想乘机而入，代以美国的殖民统治。对于这一点，英国的感觉是敏锐的，伦敦“星期电讯报”说，“艾森豪威尔主义”就是要使“美国从英国手里把西方在中东的领导势力接收过来”。因此，所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”，具体地说，就是美国企图独霸中东的狂妄的殖民侵略计划。
    美国统治集团得意忘形地认为，他们似乎遇到了一个什么好机会，可以让美国来实现这种狂妄计划。但是他们的算盘打错了。在二十世纪五十年代，在被压迫民族普遍觉醒的今天，殖民者的好机会是一去不复返了。当“艾森豪威尔主义”刚一露头，就遭到了中东人民和亚非人民的痛击。饱受殖民主义灾难、酷爱自由的中东人民懂得，他们刚刚把英法殖民者这只狼打跑，决不是为了让美国殖民者这只虎再进来。中东各国人民要求独立自由，要求做自己国家的主人，要求按照自己的方式建立自己的生活，要求以独立自主的姿态走上国际舞台，无论英法殖民者，还是美国殖民者，都不能阻挡这种历史的发展进程。中东，应该是中东各国人民的中东，“艾森豪威尔主义”注定要被“填补”到殖民主义的坟墓里去！
