Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 7th - The Indonesian News Agency reported today that the Jambi People's Representative Council has decided to separate Jambi from Central Sumatra Province and established yesterday the first regional government directly related to the central government. A fifteen-member General Affairs Committee has been established to handle the daily activities of the new Jambi region.

The Jambi People's Representative Council has decided to send a formal delegation to the capital, Jakarta, to convey the decision of the congress to the central government. Advance personnel of the delegation are currently in Jakarta. It is expected that the delegation will propose the establishment of Jambi Province and request the appointment of the current Jambi Administrative Officer, Jamin Gema, as the Governor of Jambi Province.

Rahman and Situmorang, advance personnel of the delegation, told reporters from the Indonesian News Agency that Jambi residents have long awaited the central government to make a decision to allow the region to establish a province. They said the situation is currently very chaotic, with Jambi administratively under the leadership of Central Sumatra Province (which is now ruled by the so-called "Wild Bull Division Committee"), while militarily it belongs to the Second Military District (South Sumatra). They also said that due to this situation, the Jambi region believes it is necessary to take steps on its own for the benefit of the Jambi people.

Minister of the Interior Sunarjo told reporters that he will soon submit a bill to the parliament regarding the steps taken by the People's Representative Council, requesting that the region be granted local autonomy.

    中苏门答腊占碑人民代表会
    决定同中央政府建立直接关系
    新华社雅加达7日电　印度尼西亚新闻社今天报道，占碑人民代表会已经决定把占碑从中苏门答腊省分出，并且已经在昨天成立了第一届同中央政府直接发生关系的地区性政府。一个由十五人组成的总务委员会已经成立，它处理占碑这个新地区的日常活动。
    占碑人民代表会决定派遣一个正式代表团到首都雅加达，以便把大会的决定转达给中央政府。代表团的先行人员目前已经到了雅加达。预料代表团将建议设立占碑省，并且要求任命目前的占碑行政长官贾明·格马尔为占碑省省长。
    代表团先行人员拉赫曼和西图莫兰对印度尼西亚新闻社记者说，占碑居民很久以来一直等待中央政府作出让这个地区建省的决定。他们说，现在情况非常混乱，占碑在行政上属于中苏门答腊省（这个省份现在由所谓“雄牛师委员会”统治）领导，而在军事上则属于第二军区（南苏门答腊）领导。他们又说，由于这种情况，占碑地区认为有必要为了占碑人民的利益而自行采取步骤。
    内务部长苏纳约对记者们说，他不久将就人民代表会所采取的步骤向国会提出一项法案，要求给予这个地区以地方自治。
