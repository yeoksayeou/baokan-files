Hoping Our Nation's New Scientific Forces Will Grow Quickly
    Hua Luogeng

    When I heard that I had won the Chinese Academy of Sciences Science Award, I felt a great honor, but also a sense of shame. Because I deeply know that in the great socialist construction of the motherland, my work in recent years has been insignificant. The Academy of Sciences' award to me this time should be seen more as an encouragement to my future work than as an affirmation of my past work. After accepting this lofty award, I can only redouble my efforts to do more and better work to repay the motherland, and only by cultivating more and better young people can I repay the people.

    I deeply realize that this award is not an endorsement of the research direction I am engaged in. When the mathematical departments that are most urgently needed in our country are still weak and blank, we cannot calmly ignore this situation. Of course, I am not saying that the theory of functions does not occupy an important position in mathematics, nor am I saying that we have not seen some signs of the development of the theory of functions of several complex variables; however, when we think that our computational mathematics is still in its initial stage from scratch, the number of people working on probability theory and mathematical statistics is far from enough to meet the needs of the country, and differential equations are still struggling to improve quality, we have a responsibility to hope that young people will study more of these aspects that the motherland most urgently needs. Do not think that the direction in which we won the award is the direction that the motherland most urgently needs to develop.

    I further realize that the country's award to me this time is not only to require me to do a good job in my personal research work, but the motherland needs the cultivation of new forces even more. I will definitely work harder to cultivate young people in the future, so that they are excellent in both character and knowledge, and become scientific workers who are close to the world level. I now lead three groups (number theory group, algebra group, and multi-complex variable function theory group). I hope that within twelve years, scholars at the world level can appear in each group. And I hope that there will be more than one or two such scholars. I am also leading the preparatory work for the Institute of Computing Technology. I hope that a not-so-small team of computational mathematics will appear in the motherland in five years. Under the leadership of the Party and with the unprecedented high enthusiasm of young comrades, these tasks are extremely confident.

    Of course, I also deeply realize that this award is not to make me become more simply focused on academics, without caring about the destiny of the motherland and the great cause of socialism. In the future, while doing a better job in my major, I will also pay more attention to the greatest interests of the motherland.

    Finally, I repeat: I feel ashamed and honored. Use shame to encourage my future, and attribute glory to the Party and Chairman Mao who lead us, and to the mathematicians across the country.

    希望我国科学新生力量很快成长
    华罗庚
    在我听到我获得了中国科学院科学奖金的时候，感觉到莫大的光荣，但也感觉到惭愧。因为我深深知道，在祖国伟大的社会主义建设事业中，我这几年的工作是微不足道的。科学院这次对我的奖励，与其把它看成为对我已往工作的肯定，还远不如把它看成是对我将来工作的策励的好。在我接受了这崇高的奖励之后，我只有益自奋发，做出更多更好的工作来报答祖国，只有用培养出更多更好的青年来报答人民。
    我深深体会到，这次的奖励，并不是奖励我所从事的研究方向。在我国最迫切需要的数学部门还是薄弱和空白的时候，我们不能坦然不顾这种状况。当然，我并不是说函数论在数学中不占重要地位，也不是说多复变数函数论的发展我们没有看出了一些苗头；但是，在想到我国计算数学还在从无到有的草创阶段，概率论与数理统计的工作人数还远不足以适应国家需要，微分方程还在极艰苦地提高质量的时候，我们有责任希望青年们多多研究这些祖国最迫切需要的方面。不要以为我们所得奖的方向是祖国所最急需发展的方向。
    我更体会到国家这次对我的奖励，不只是要求我搞好我个人的研究工作，祖国更需要的是新生力量的培养。我今后一定更加紧来培养青年们，使他们品质学识都优秀，并且成为接近世界水平的科学工作者。我现在领导了三个组（数论组、代数组和多复变数函数论组），我希望在十二年内能够在每一组都出现达到世界水平的学者。并且希望这种学者不止是一个或两个。我现在也领导了计算技术研究所的筹备工作，我希望五年内在祖国出现一支不很小的计算数学的队伍。在党的领导下，在青年同志积极性空前高涨的情况下，这些工作都是极有信心的。
    当然，我也深深体会到这一次的奖励不是使我变成为更单纯地注意学术，而不关心祖国的命运和社会主义的伟大事业。我今后一定在进一步搞好专业的同时，也更关心祖国的最大利益。
    最后，我再重复一句：我感到惭愧和光荣。把惭愧来策励我的未来，把光荣归之于领导我们的党和毛主席，归之于全国的数学工作者们。
