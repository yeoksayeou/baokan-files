Xinhua News Agency, 30th - Many famous scholars and teachers across the country have begun to compile textbooks for various majors in institutions of higher education. The Ministry of Higher Education and relevant departments organized the compilation of 563 kinds of higher education textbooks in 1956. More than 200 more are planned to be organized and compiled in 1957.

After these textbooks are compiled, most of the basic courses, basic technical courses, and some specialized courses in various majors of higher education will have textbooks that can better reflect the latest achievements of modern science and suit the actual situation of Chinese higher education.

According to the urgent needs of the majors and the current conditions, various methods have been adopted for the compilation of these textbooks. Some are compiled by one person alone, some are jointly compiled by several people, some are compiled by one teaching and research group alone, or some are jointly compiled by several teaching and research groups, etc. The jointly compiled textbooks also have methods such as being compiled centrally in one place, or being compiled separately in various places with one person responsible for contact and summary. The Ministry of Higher Education requires relevant schools to assist teachers in solving some specific problems in the textbook compilation work.

The Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Culture also convened a symposium of representatives from relevant publishing houses at the central level to discuss the issue of publishing higher education textbooks based on professional division of labor.

In the first half of 1956, the Ministry of Higher Education and relevant departments separately studied the long-term plan for textbooks for various majors in institutions of higher education. According to preliminary determination, more than 3,000 kinds of higher education textbooks will be organized and compiled in the next twelve years. For each course, necessary teaching reference books or specialized works will also be prepared according to needs or different schools of thought.

    编写高等学校各类专业的教材
    新华社30日讯　全国很多著名学者和教师已经着手编写高等学校各类专业的教材。高等教育部和有关部门在1956年内组织编写的高等学校教材共有五百六十三种。1957年还准备组织编写两百多种。
    这些教材编成以后，高等学校各类专业的大部分基础课、基础技术课和部分专业课，就可以有比较能够反映现代科学最新成就和切合中国高等学校实际情况的教材。
    根据专业的急需和目前的条件，这些教材的编写工作采取了多种多样的方式。有的一人独编，有的几人合编，有的一个教研组独编，或者有的由几个教研组合编等。合编的教材，也还有集中一地编，或者分散各地编由一人负责联系和汇总等等方式。高等教育部要求有关学校协助教师解决教材编写工作中的一些具体问题。
    高等教育部和文化部还召集中央一级有关出版社的代表座谈了按专业分工出版高等学校教材的问题。
    高等教育部和有关部门在1956年上半年，曾经分别研究了高等学校各类专业教材的远景规划。按照初步确定，在今后十二年内将组织编写三千种以上高等学校教材。每门课程还准备根据需要或不同的学派，编写必要的教学参考书或专门著作。
