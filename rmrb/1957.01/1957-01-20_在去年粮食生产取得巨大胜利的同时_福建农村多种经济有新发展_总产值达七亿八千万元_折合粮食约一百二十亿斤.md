According to a report from the Fujian Daily: While achieving a great victory in grain production last year, Fujian Province's diversified economy has also experienced new development. According to statistics from relevant departments in the province: the total output value of forestry, sideline occupations, fishing, local specialties, and animal husbandry in the province last year, calculated at constant prices, increased by more than 5% compared to 1955. Adding the increase in prices, the growth is about 11%, with a total output value of about 780 million yuan, equivalent to approximately 12 billion jin of grain. This is a significant achievement made by Fujian Province after implementing the policy of comprehensive development of production in the second half of last year.

Fujian Province is located in the subtropical zone, with more than 80% of its territory being mountainous and having a long coastline, making it suitable for developing diversified economies such as forestry, sideline occupations, local specialties, and fishing. In the first half of last year, due to the singular focus on grain production, the diversified economy was neglected, which for a time caused a shortage of many products and reduced farmers' incomes. After the Provincial Party Congress in July last year, all regions, based on local production characteristics, comprehensively planned production according to local conditions. Agricultural cooperatives also leveraged the advantages of cooperative management, dividing the scope of collective and individual sideline business, promoting the development of household sideline occupations. Relevant economic departments corrected some unreasonable purchase prices and some undesirable practices of downgrading in purchasing. The state also issued large amounts of loans and implemented ordering methods to support farmers in developing diversified economic production. In addition, the construction and phased opening of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, which runs across the mountainous areas of the province, provided extremely favorable conditions for the development of the province's diversified economy. As a result, diversified economic production achieved rapid recovery and development in the second half of last year, not only making up for the losses in the first half of the year, but also increasing the total output value compared to 1955. Among them, the number of live pigs increased by about 5%, reaching more than 2.7 million; chickens, ducks, geese, and rabbits reached more than 48.5 million; timber production reached more than 1.47 million cubic meters, an increase of more than 12%; fishery production reached 5.1 million dan, an increase of more than 12%; flue-cured tobacco reached more than 19,000 dan, and jute reached 270,000 dan, both increasing by more than 30%; dried bamboo shoots, native paper, and tea also increased significantly; tea reached more than 145,000 dan, an increase of 26%; processing, transportation and other sideline productions also increased by more than 3%.

After the development of diversified economic production, the market supply of many products increased, and essential daily necessities for people's lives such as firewood, charcoal, vegetables, and native paper were basically adequately supplied. Tea and dried bamboo shoots were transported out of the province in large quantities to meet the needs of people's lives. The tense supply of raw materials for industry and handicrafts was also eased, and many basic construction projects that were originally suspended due to lack of materials such as lime, bricks, and tiles resumed normal construction. At the same time, farmers' incomes also greatly increased. In the Nanping Special District, more than 400,000 farm households earned an average of 200 yuan from the development of diversified economy, an increase of about 40 yuan compared to 1955. The development of sideline production has also strongly supported grain production and further consolidated agricultural cooperatives.

    在去年粮食生产取得巨大胜利的同时
    福建农村多种经济有新发展
    总产值达七亿八千万元　折合粮食约一百二十亿斤
    本报讯　据福建日报报道：在去年粮食生产取得巨大胜利的同时，福建省的多种经济生产也有了新的发展。据这个省的有关部门统计：全省去年林、副、渔业、土特产和畜牧业等生产的总产值，以不变价格计算，比1955年增加5％强，加上提高价格部分，则增长约11％，总产值达到七亿八千万元左右，折合粮食约一百二十亿斤。这是福建省在去年下半年贯彻全面发展生产的方针以后，所取得的很大成绩。
    福建省处于亚热带，境内80％以上是山地，并有漫长的海岸线，宜于发展林、副、土特产和渔业等多种经济。去年上半年由于领导生产的单一化，忽视了多种经济生产，曾一度造成许多产品供应紧张，农民收入减少。去年7月全省党代表大会后，各地都根据当地生产特点，因地制宜地全面规划了生产；农业合作社也发挥合作经营的优越性，划分了集体和个人经营副业的范围，推动了家庭副业的发展；有关经济部门纠正了某些收购价格不合理的现象，以及收购中某些压等压级的不良作风；国家并发放了大批贷款，实行订购等办法，扶助农民发展多种经济生产；加上横贯省内山区的鹰厦铁路的修建和逐段通车，对这个省多种经济生产的发展提供了极为有利的条件。因此，多种经济生产在去年下半年获得迅速的恢复和发展，不仅弥补了上半年的损失，而且总产值比1955年还有所增加。其中生猪增长约5％，达到二百七十多万头；鸡、鸭、鹅、兔达到四千八百五十多万只；木材生产达到一百四十七万多立方公尺，增长12％强；渔业生产达到五百一十万担，也增长12％强；烤烟达到一万九千多担，黄麻达到二十七万担，都增产30％以上；笋干、土纸、茶叶也增加不少；茶叶达到十四万五千多担，增产26％；加工、运输等副业生产也增长3％以上。
    多种经济生产获得发展以后，许多产品上市量增加了，人民日常生活不可缺少的柴炭、蔬菜、土纸等基本上供应充裕，茶叶、笋干大批运出省外，满足人民生活的需求；工业、手工业原料供应紧张的状况也有了缓和，许多原来停工待料的基本建设工程因为有了石灰、砖瓦，也恢复了正常施工。同时，农民收入也大大增加了，南平专区四十多万农户，每户平均从发展多种经济中收入了二百元，比1955年约增加四十元。副业生产的发展，还有力地支持了粮食生产，进一步巩固了农业合作社。
