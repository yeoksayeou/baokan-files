Xinhua News Agency, January 13th -- Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Yunnan, Liaoning, and Anhui provinces have all overfulfilled their 1956 cotton unified purchase plans.

Of these six provinces, the cotton output of the first five, except for Anhui Province, exceeded that of 1955. Liaoning and Jiangxi provinces more than doubled their production compared to 1955. These five provinces began purchasing new cotton successively in August and September of last year, and by the end of the year, the amount of cotton purchased was greater than the amount purchased during the same period in 1955. Hubei Province had 46% more, Liaoning Province had more than double, and Jiangxi Province had one and a half times more. Anhui Province suffered from typhoons and floods last year, but its output and purchases were still close to the 1955 level.

Agricultural product purchasing personnel are still continuing to purchase cotton. Jiangxi Province found a lot of cotton discarded in cotton fields and on cotton plants, and is mobilizing farmers to pick it up. Farmers in Qiuxi District of Chongren County have already picked up 35,000 jin of fallen cotton.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 13th -- Shaanxi Province has overfulfilled its 1956 tea and animal product purchase plan. By the end of last year, tea purchases had increased by 31% compared to the actual purchases in 1955. Purchases of goat wool, horse mane and tail, and feathers all increased by more than double compared to the actual purchases in 1955.

In 1956, the ten counties in Shaanxi Province's main tea-producing areas, such as Ziyang, Lan'gao, and Ankang, all achieved cooperativization. Agricultural cooperative members cultivated tea gardens more carefully, which greatly increased tea production, breaking the highest level in history.

In addition to actively developing livestock and catching wild animals, agricultural cooperatives in various places also universally promoted shearing and wool-grabbing techniques. Many agricultural cooperatives in the region adopted the "live cattle grabbing hair" method to increase cattle hair production. More than 40,000 live cattle throughout the province underwent hair grabbing, enabling purchasing units to acquire more than 20,000 jin of cattle hair. Last year, many new varieties such as cow bladders, goose feathers, and chicken and duck feathers were also added to the purchase of animal products.

    湖北等六省棉花统购计划超额完成
    陕西省超额完成1956年茶叶和畜产品收购计划
    新华社13日讯　湖北、江西、湖南、云南、辽宁、安徽六省1956年度的棉花统购计划已经超额完成。
    这六个省中，除了安徽省以外，其他五个省去年的棉花产量都超过1955年，辽宁、江西两省并且比1955年增产一倍以上。这五个省从去年8、9月份先后开始收购新棉，到年底收购的棉花都比1955年同期的收购量要多，湖北省多46％，辽宁省多一倍以上，江西省多一倍半。安徽省去年遭受了台风、雨涝等灾害，但是产量和收购量也都接近1955年的水平。
    农产品采购人员目前还在继续收购棉花。江西省发现丢弃在棉田和棉棵上的棉花很多，正在动员农民拣拾。崇仁县秋溪区的农民已经拣到落地棉三万五千斤。
    新华社西安13日电　陕西省超额完成了1956年茶叶和畜产品收购计划。到去年年底，茶叶收购量比1955年实际收购量增加了31％。山羊毛、马鬃尾、羽毛等收购量都比1955年实际收购量增加一倍以上。
    1956年，陕西省主要产茶区的紫阳、岚皋、安康等十县都实现了合作化。农业社社员更加精细地培植茶园，使茶叶产量大大增加，突破了历史上的最高水平。
    各地农业社除了积极发展牲畜和捕打野生畜以外，还普遍推广了剪毛、抓绒技术。许多地区的农业社采取“活牛抓毛”办法，增产牛毛。全省有四万头以上的活牛经过抓毛，使收购单位收购到了两万多斤牛毛。去年在畜产品收购方面还增加了牛膀胱、雁毛、鸡鸭毛等许多新的品种。
