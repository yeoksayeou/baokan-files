	Reactions to Criticism
	The article "A Deal of Passing Off Fish Eyes for Pearls" published in this newspaper on September 24, 1956, has been jointly investigated by the Guangxi Provincial Procuratorate, the Supervision Department, the Department of Commerce, and the China Chemical Raw Materials Company. The Guangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Guangxi Chemical Raw Materials Company should bear the primary responsibility for the blind promotion of alum as fertilizer, which resulted in losses to the state and farmers. However, based on the nature of the issue, it cannot be said that the Guangxi Chemical Raw Materials Company intentionally passed off alum as ammonium chloride for sale.

    对批评的反应
    本报在1956年9月24日发表的“鱼目混珠的买卖”一文，已经广西省检察院、监察厅、商业厅、中国化工原料公司联合进行了检查。广西省农业厅和广西省化工原料公司对盲目推广明矾作肥料，以致造成国家和农民遭受损失应负主要责任。但从问题的性质来看，还不能说广西省化工原料公司有意把明矾充作氯化铵出售。
