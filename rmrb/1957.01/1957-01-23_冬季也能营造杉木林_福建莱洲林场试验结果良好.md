Winter Afforestation of Chinese Fir Forests Achieved Good Results in Laizhou Forest Farm, Fujian

(Our newspaper dispatch) Fuzhou — Winter is also suitable for afforestation of Chinese fir forests. This is the conclusion drawn by Laizhou Forest Farm in Nanping Prefecture, Fujian Province after more than two years of experiments. From now on, in this mountainous Nanping Prefecture, not only can the time for afforesting Chinese fir forests be greatly extended each year, but also the difficulty of insufficient labor in mountainous areas affecting afforestation in spring can be overcome.

Chinese fir is the most important timber forest tree species in Fujian Province. In the past, afforestation of Chinese fir forests in Nanping Prefecture was generally practiced between "Beginning of Spring" and "Rain Water" solar terms. Local farmers were often affected in their preparations for early rice cultivation in spring due to afforestation. In order to solve this difficulty, Laizhou Forest Farm in Nanping Prefecture conducted winter afforestation experiments in 1954, planting 400 Chinese fir seedlings and 400 cuttings. After two years of observation, it has been proven that the survival rate of Chinese fir forests planted from December 5th of that year to February 5th of the following year is very high: the average survival rate of seedlings reached 92%, which is even higher than that of seedlings planted during the "Beginning of Spring" to "Rain Water" period in previous years; the survival rate of cuttings was also above 76%. Among them, the survival rate of those planted on February 5th was the highest, with a seedling survival rate of 99% and a cutting survival rate of 84%.

According to Wang Zhaotai, a forestry expert from the Fujian Provincial Forestry Department, judging from the experimental situation of Laizhou Forest Farm in Nanping Prefecture, afforestation of Chinese fir forests in the mountainous areas of western Fujian can be appropriately advanced to early December, which will be of great significance for large-scale afforestation of Chinese fir forests in the future.

    冬季也能营造杉木林
    福建莱洲林场试验结果良好
    本报讯　冬季也可营造杉木林。——这是福建省南平专区莱洲林场经过两年多的实验得出的结论。从此，这个山岭重重的南平专区，不仅每年营造杉木林的时间可以大大延长，而且也可以克服山区在春季因劳力不足而影响造林的困难。
    杉木是福建省最主要的用材林树种。过去，南平专区营造杉木林一般习惯在“立春”至“雨水”之间，当地农民往往因造林而影响春季早稻备耕工作的开展。南平专区莱洲林场为了解决这个困难，在1954年冬季试验营造了杉木实生苗四百株、插条四百条。经过两年来的观察，证明从当年12月5日到翌年2月5日营造杉木林的成活率都很高：实生苗成活率平均达到92％，比往年“立春”至“雨水”期间营造的还高；插条的成活率也在76％以上。其中，以2月5日营造的成活率为最高，实生苗成活率达99％，插条是84％。
    据福建省林业厅林业专家王兆泰说，从南平专区莱洲林场实验情况来看，福建闽西一带山区营造杉木林可以适当提前在12月初开展，这对今后大量营造杉木林有很大作用。　　　　（本报福建记者站）
