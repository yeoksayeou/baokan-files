Many Medical Experts from Shanghai and Other Places Go Deep into Rural Jiangsu to Treat Schistosomiasis

(Our newspaper dispatch) Since last year, with the development of schistosomiasis prevention and treatment work in Qingpu County, Jiangsu Province, more and more senior intellectuals in the medical field have been conducting in-depth visits to rural areas. According to incomplete statistics, by the beginning of January this year, medical experts and professors from Shanghai, Nanjing, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hunan, and Hubei had gone to rural Qingpu to treat schistosomiasis more than one hundred times.

Last year, just as many local doctors in Qingpu were worried about not being able to treat late-stage schistosomiasis patients, the Scientific Research Committee for the Prevention and Treatment of Schistosomiasis of the Central Government organized Huang Mingxin, professor of internal medicine at Shanghai Second Medical College, Zhang Min, surgical expert, Pan Rusun, parasitology expert, Jiang Shaoji, director of Shanghai Hongren Hospital, and Xu Jiayu, attending physician of internal medicine at the hospital, to go to the Zhujiajiao District of Qingpu County to assist the Qingpu County People's Hospital in treating nearly one hundred late-stage patients. Many experts and professors often went deep into rural areas to visit patients. Huang Mingxin and Jiang Shaoji, among others, voluntarily gave up their summer vacation rest to visit Rentun Village and investigate and treat ten difficult "dwarfism" patients. Experts in traditional Chinese medicine also frequently went deep into rural Qingpu to treat schistosomiasis with traditional Chinese medicine. Ye Juchuan, Cheng Menxue, president of Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Zhang Zanchen, director of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Department of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, have all visited rural Qingpu.

In order to fundamentally control the infection of schistosomiasis, experts and professors also studied comprehensive prevention and treatment work. Wang Mingshi, professor of the former East China Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, went to Chengbei Township in Qingpu to investigate fecal management work. Sun Zhenzhong, an old professor of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences of the People's Liberation Army, who is nearly sixty years old, even stayed in Chengbei Township for many days.

In the past year, with the help and guidance of these senior intellectuals, more than 6,800 patients have been cured in Qingpu County. (Hong)

    上海等地许多医学专家
    深入江苏农村治疗血吸虫病
    本报讯　去年以来，随着江苏省青浦县防治血吸虫病工作的开展，深入访问农村的医学界高级知识分子越来越多。根据不完全的统计，到今年1月初，上海、南京、浙江、广东、湖南和湖北等地的医学专家、教授前往青浦农村治疗血吸虫病已有一百多次。
    去年，正当青浦当地许多医师无法治疗后期血吸虫病人而发愁时，中央防治血吸虫病科学研究委员会组织上海第二医学院教授内科专家黄铭新、外科专家张敏、寄生虫病专家潘儒荪、上海宏仁医院院长江绍基和该院内科主治医师徐家裕等，前往青浦县朱家角区，协助青浦县人民医院治疗近一百个后期病人。不少专家、教授经常深入农村访问病人。黄铭新和江绍基等还自动放弃暑假中的休息，访问了任屯村，调查诊治了十个难治的“侏儒症”病人。中医界的专家们也经常深入青浦农村用中药治疗血吸虫病。中医叶橘泉、上海市中医医学院院长程门雪和上海市卫生局中医处处长张赞臣等，都曾访问青浦农村。
    为了从根本上控制血吸虫病的感染，专家、教授们还研究了综合性防治工作。中国科学院前华东分院教授王铭视曾到青浦城北乡考查粪便管理工作。解放军医学科学院年近六十岁的老教授孙振中并在城北乡住上好多天。
    去年一年来，在这些高级知识分子的帮助、指导下，青浦全县已经治好六千八百多个病人。（洪）
