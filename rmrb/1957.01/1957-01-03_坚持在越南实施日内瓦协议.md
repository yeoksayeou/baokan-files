　　Adhere to the Implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam

　　The Sixth Interim Report of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam, published today, once again exposes various facts of the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities violating the Geneva Accords. All countries and people concerned with upholding the Geneva Accords cannot but express concern about the current situation in Vietnam.

　　Vietnam is now in a state of artificial division. The provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding the reunification of Vietnam through free nationwide elections have been severely undermined by the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities.

　　On May 8, 1956, the two Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference wrote to both sides in Vietnam, requesting them to "make every effort to implement the Geneva Agreements on Vietnam, to prevent any future violations of the military clauses of the Geneva Agreements, and to guarantee the implementation of the political clauses and principles contained in the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference." The two Chairmen also requested both sides in Vietnam to propose dates for the commencement of consultations and the eventual holding of free nationwide elections in Vietnam. After receiving this letter from the two Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam immediately reiterated its proposal to the South Vietnamese authorities and expressed to the two Chairmen that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was prepared to begin consultations with South Vietnam as soon as possible in order to organize free nationwide elections in Vietnam in accordance with the terms of the Geneva Accords and the decisions of the two Chairmen. However, in its reply to the two Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference on May 22, 1956, the South Vietnamese authorities, while acknowledging that "truly free elections are the democratic method of achieving national reunification," used the excuses that "South Vietnam is not bound by the Geneva Accords" and that "conditions for free elections do not exist in North Vietnam" to refuse to implement the Geneva Accords, claiming that "the question of preparing for and conducting elections is practically out of the question at present." Ngo Dinh Diem's remarks to Agence France-Presse reporters on November 5, 1956, regarding the issue of free nationwide elections in Vietnam, were essentially the same as the aforementioned letter of May 22. Until now, the South Vietnamese authorities have not, in accordance with the request of the two Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference, proposed to the two Chairmen the dates for the commencement of consultations and the eventual holding of free nationwide elections in Vietnam.

　　It is clear that the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities fear and oppose holding free nationwide elections in Vietnam, but the South Vietnamese authorities are trying to present themselves as being in favor of holding such elections, while妄想 (wangxiang - vainly attempting) to attribute the impossibility of these elections to the so-called "lack of freedom in North Vietnam." The main purpose of the Ngo Dinh Diem group's recent intensification of its slander campaign against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, led by the United States, is to coordinate with the above-mentioned conspiracy of the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities to undermine free nationwide elections in Vietnam while attempting to blame others. However, this approach is futile.

　　Who exactly is trampling on the democratic freedoms of the Vietnamese people in Vietnam? The Sixth Interim Report of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam, published today, is very helpful in answering this question. This report shows that the South Vietnamese authorities are continuing to violate paragraph 14(c) of the Vietnam Ceasefire Agreement regarding the guarantee of democratic freedoms for the people, and are creating various incidents of persecution in South Vietnam. Fearing that its atrocities of this kind would be fully exposed, the South Vietnamese authorities had exhausted all means to obstruct the investigative work of the International Commission in South Vietnam. During the period of the Sixth Interim Report (December 11, 1955, to July 31, 1956), not a single international mobile team dispatched to South Vietnam to conduct such investigations was able to proceed. Conversely, despite numerous accusations made by the South Vietnamese side, the International Commission has never considered that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has violated paragraph 14(c) of the Vietnam Ceasefire Agreement. This is a stark contrast. Recently, the South Vietnamese side has also re-ignited the clamor of the so-called "North Vietnam obstructing the movement of civilians to the South," attempting to use this as "evidence" of "lack of freedom in North Vietnam." However, as pointed out in the Sixth Interim Report of the International Commission, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had suggested that all Vietnamese people should be able to travel freely between the two regions indefinitely, and it was precisely the South Vietnamese side that opposed this suggestion.

　　The attempt by the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities to evade their responsibility for undermining free nationwide elections in Vietnam is unconvincing, not only because their slanders against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are without factual basis, but also because it is clearly self-contradictory to claim in principle to be in favor of holding truly free nationwide elections in Vietnam while fundamentally refusing to engage in any consultations on how to organize these elections (including how to guarantee the conditions of freedom for these elections). It should be pointed out once again that the consultations between the two sides in Vietnam regarding the election issue, as stipulated in the Geneva Accords, have as one of their most important tasks to discuss and determine specific ways to ensure that the nationwide elections in Vietnam can be conducted under completely free conditions. If the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities are really in favor of achieving truly free nationwide elections in Vietnam, they should adopt a positive attitude towards these consultations.

　　It is worth noting that while undermining free nationwide elections in Vietnam, the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities have also intensified military activities in South Vietnam. The Sixth Interim Report of the International Commission has already confirmed the fact that U.S. military personnel and war materials have repeatedly entered South Vietnam illegally. This situation has become even more serious in recent months. It is clear that the United States, disregarding the various provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding the maintenance of Vietnam as a peaceful region and the repeated protests of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam, is continuing to arm and strengthen its control over South Vietnam in order to realize its conspiracy to permanently divide Vietnam, enslave and monopolize South Vietnam, and use South Vietnam as a tool for the United States to create tension and undermine peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

　　Given that the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam is facing serious obstacles, people believe that the participating countries of the Geneva Conference should take joint and effective measures to seek the complete implementation of the Geneva Accords, which is a responsibility they cannot shirk. The struggle to uphold the Geneva Accords, like the struggle to achieve satisfactory solutions to other major international issues, is a long-term, arduous, and complex struggle. As long as the Vietnamese people and all peace-loving countries and people wage a struggle to the end, then, as President Ho Chi Minh recently said, this struggle is bound to achieve victory in the end.

### 坚持在越南实施日内瓦协议

    坚持在越南实施日内瓦协议
    今天公布的越南国际委员会第六次工作报告，又一次揭露了美国和南越当局违反日内瓦协议的种种事实。一切关心维护日内瓦协议的国家和人民，都不能不对目前越南的局势表示关切。
    越南现在正处在人为的分裂状态。日内瓦协议关于越南经由全国自由选举以恢复其统一的规定，遭到了美国和南越当局的严重破坏。
    1956年5月8日，日内瓦会议两位主席曾经写信给越南双方，要求它们“尽一切努力来实现关于越南的日内瓦协议，防止今后对日内瓦协议的军事条款的任何违反，并且保证履行日内瓦会议最后宣言中所载的政治条款和原则。”两位主席还要求越南双方提出开始协商和最后举行越南全国自由选举的日期。在接到日内瓦会议两位主席这一信件后，越南民主共和国政府马上就再度向南越当局提出，并且对两位主席表示：越南民主共和国方面准备尽速同南越方面开始协商，以便按照日内瓦协议的条款和两位主席的决定，组织越南全国自由选举。但是，南越当局在1956年5月22日给日内瓦会议两位主席的答复中，一方面承认“真正自由的大选是达成国家的重新统一的民主的方法”，另一方面却又以“南越不受日内瓦协议的约束”和“北越不存在自由选举的条件”为借口，拒绝实施日内瓦的协议，声称“目前实际上谈不到准备选举和进行选举的问题”。吴庭艳在1956年11月5日对法新社记者关于越南全国自由选举问题的谈话，在实际上和上述5月22日的信件是属于同一路数的。一直到现在为止，南越当局还没有按照日内瓦会议两位主席的要求，向两位主席提出开始协商和最后举行越南全国自由选举的日期。
    很显然，美国和南越当局害怕和反对举行越南全国自由选举，可是南越当局却力图把自己装扮成为赞成举行这一选举的样子，而妄想将这一选举的无法实现归咎于所谓“北越没有自由”。最近吴庭艳集团在美国所带头煽起的反共浪潮中所以加紧对越南民主共和国大肆诬蔑，其主要目的之一，也正是为了要配合美国和南越当局破坏越南全国自由选举而又想嫁罪他人的上述阴谋。但是，他们这种做法是徒劳的。
    到底是谁在越南蹂躏越南人民的民主自由呢？今天公布的越南国际委员会第六次工作报告对于回答这个问题是很有帮助的。这个报告表明，南越当局正继续违反越南停战协定第十四款丙项关于保障人民民主自由的规定，在南越制造各种迫害事件。而由于害怕自己的这一类暴行被完全揭发，南越当局曾经用尽各种方法来阻挠国际委员会在南越的调查工作。在第六次工作报告期间（1955年12月11日到1956年7月31日），奉派前往南越进行这一类调查的国际机动小组，竟然没有一个能够成行。反之，尽管南越方面提出许多诬控，国际委员会却从来没有认为越南民主共和国曾经违反了越南停战协定第十四款丙项。这是一个鲜明的对照。最近，南越方面还重新掀起了所谓“北越阻挠平民南迁”的叫嚣，企图以此作为“北越没有自由”的“证据”。可是，正如国际委员会第六次工作报告所指明的，越南民主共和国方面曾经建议让所有越南人民都能够无限期地在双方地区间自由往来，而反对这个建议的恰恰是南越方面。
    美国和南越当局想推卸其破坏越南全国自由选举的罪责的做法所以骗不了人，不但是因为它们对越南民主共和国的诽谤毫无事实根据，而且也因为一方面声称在原则上赞成举行真正自由的越南全国选举，而另一方面却根本拒绝就如何组织这一选举（包括如何保证这一选举的自由条件）的问题进行任何协商，这显然是自相矛盾的。应该再一次指出，日内瓦协议所规定的越南双方有关选举问题的协商，其最主要的任务之一就是为了要讨论并且确定如何使越南全国选举能够在完全自由的条件下进行的具体办法。如果美国和南越当局真的赞成在越南实现真正自由的全国选举，它们就应该对这一协商采取积极的态度。
    值得注意的是，美国和南越当局在破坏越南全国自由选举的同时，还在南越加紧了军事活动。国际委员会第六次工作报告已经肯定了美国的军事人员和作战物资多次非法进入南越的事实。这种情况在最近几个月来还更加严重。很显然，美国正不顾日内瓦协议关于维护越南成为和平地区的各项规定和越南国际委员会的一再抗议，继续武装并加强控制南越，以便其实现长期分裂越南的阴谋，奴役并独占南越，而且把南越作为美国在印度支那和东南亚制造紧张局势、破坏和平的工具。
    鉴于日内瓦协议在越南的实施正遭受到严重的障碍，人们认为，日内瓦会议的参加国应该采取共同的有效措施，谋求日内瓦协议的彻底实现，这是他们不能推卸的责任。维护日内瓦协议的斗争，同争取圆满解决其他重大国际问题的斗争一样，是一个长期、艰巨和复杂的斗争，只要越南人民和一切爱好和平的国家与人民进行坚持到底的斗争，那么，正如胡志明主席最近所说，这个斗争最后是一定会取得胜利的。
