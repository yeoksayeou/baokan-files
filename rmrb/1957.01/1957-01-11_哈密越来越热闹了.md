A New City is Moving Forward

    Hami is Getting More and More Lively
    Hao Jian
    With the construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, Hami appears even more bustling.

    Standing on the streets of Hami, one can always see a constant stream of trucks, some carrying materials to the railway construction site; others loaded with goods taller than the driver's cab driving through the streets. Jeeps, bicycles, and horse-drawn carts, honking their horns, ringing their bells, and yelling at their livestock, shuttle back and forth. Just two years ago, this was still a quiet town!

    The increasingly prosperous streets of Hami are showing new scenes everywhere. New houses are constantly being erected on both sides of the street. In the past, what was once a desert area in Beishawo has had over 23,000 square meters of houses built in less than a year. Here, there is a library with a capacity of 50,000 books, and both a halal and a Han Chinese dining hall that can accommodate 180 people simultaneously. There are also newly built department stores, post and telecommunications bureaus, banks, and other office buildings and dormitories for various organizations, where staff members are busy decorating the interiors. According to comrades from the Hami Administrative Office, the construction area of Hami town last year increased more than threefold compared to the previous year, and in order to welcome the arrival of the train in Hami, this year's construction will increase threefold compared to 1956.

    With the development of various construction undertakings in Xinjiang and the construction of the railway, the industry and commerce of Hami town have also developed rapidly. In 1953, Hami had only one trading company and one cooperative office, but by 1956, seventeen specialized companies such as department stores, pharmaceuticals, and food had been established. The sales of these companies are increasing month by month; taking the department store as an example, sales in 1956 increased by more than 90% compared to 1955. Those ironware, carpentry, and fur industries that were once bleak and deserted have seen particularly booming business since the establishment of handicraft cooperatives.

    At the intersection, pedestrians throng. The Kazakh herders from the Tianshan Mountains, wearing wide fur coats and fur hats, stride into and out of the shops, selecting their favorite brick tea or fur hats. Uyghur farmers from the suburbs drive their donkeys, and after selling grain and Hami melons, return fully loaded with blankets, fabrics, and daily necessities. The streets are even more lively on Sundays, with groups of Uyghur and Hui students heading to bookstores or cinemas. The officers and soldiers of the railway troops and many cadres and workers from the mainland who have come to support the construction of the border regions also flock to the streets on this day.

    People of Uyghur, Hui, Kazakh, and Han ethnicities live in Hami town. Before liberation, due to the provocations of the Kuomintang reactionaries, there was a great divide between the various ethnic groups. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, ethnic policies were correctly implemented, and the divisions between the various ethnic groups gradually disappeared. Now, all ethnic groups respect each other's customs, help each other, and work together, filled with an atmosphere of national unity. The Hami Fur Handicraft Production Cooperative, which is composed of Uyghur, Hui, and Han nationalities, is one such example. When it was first established, some Han members experienced financial difficulties, and Uyghur members automatically lent them money and flour; similarly, when Uyghur members had difficulties, Han and Hui members also tried their best to help. They also exchanged experiences and improved their skills. The Han people taught the Hui people how to make felt tubes, and the Uyghur people taught the Hui and Han members how to make leather coats. Such examples of unity and friendship can be found everywhere in the streets, enterprises, and organizations.

### 哈密越来越热闹了

    哈密越来越热闹了
    郝健
    随着兰新铁路的修建，哈密显得更热闹了。
    人们站在哈密街头，总可以看见那些川流不息的卡车群，有的载着材料开往铁路工地；有的装着比驾驶室还高的货物驶过大街。吉普车、自行车和马车，鸣着喇叭，按着响铃，吆喝着牲口，像穿梭似的来回。两年前，这里还是个冷落的市镇呢！
    日益繁荣的哈密街头，到处出现了新的景象。在大街两旁不断地矗立起新的房屋。过去原是一片沙漠的北沙窝，不到一年的时间，建筑了二万三千多平方公尺的房屋。在这里，有一个能藏书五万册的图书馆，有容纳一百八十人同时进餐的清真和汉族食堂。还有刚建成的百货公司、邮电局、银行和其他机关的办公室和宿舍，各族职工正忙碌地在装修内部。据哈密专署的同志说，去年哈密镇的建筑面积比前年增加了三倍多，为了迎接火车通到哈密，今年要比1956年增加三倍。
    随着新疆各项建设事业的发展和铁路的修建，哈密镇的工商业也迅速发展起来了。1953年哈密只有一个贸易公司和一个合作社办事处，到1956年已设立了百货、医药、食品等十七个专业公司。这些公司的商品销售额月月都在增加；仅以百货公司来说，1956年销售额比1955年就增大了90％多。那些过去萧条冷落的铁业、木器、毛皮业等，自成立了手工业合作社后，生意特别旺盛。
    在十字街口上，行人熙熙攘攘。穿着宽皮袄戴着皮帽子的天山哈萨克牧民，昂首阔步，出入于店铺之间，选购他们喜爱的砖茶或皮帽。郊区的维吾尔族农民赶着毛驴，在出售了粮食和哈密瓜以后，满载而归的是毯子、布匹和日用品。星期日街道上更加热闹，成群结队的维族和回族的学生，走向书店或电影院。铁道部队的官兵们和许多从内地来支援边疆建设的干部和工人，这一天也都拥向了街头。
    哈密镇内居住着维吾尔、回、哈萨克、汉等民族的人民。解放前，由于国民党反动派的挑拨离间，各族人民之间有很大的隔阂。解放后，在党和人民政府的领导下，正确地执行了民族政策，各族人民间的隔阂逐渐消除了。现在，各族人民互相尊重风俗习惯，互相帮助，共同劳动，充满了民族团结的气氛。哈密毛皮手工业生产合作社，就是一个由维吾尔、回、汉三个民族组成的，刚成立时，有的汉族社员生活发生了困难，维吾尔族社员就自动地借钱和面给他们；同样地，维吾尔族社员有了困难，汉、回族社员也尽力帮助。他们还互相交流经验，提高技术，汉族教给回族做毡筒，维吾尔族教给回、汉族社员做皮大衣，像这样团结友好的事例，无论在街道、企业和机关里到处都可以找到。
