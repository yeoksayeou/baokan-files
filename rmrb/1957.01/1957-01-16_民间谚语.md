    Don't mind if others stammer,
    Just listen, it's not bad at all.
          ＊
    To learn amazing skills,
    You need to put in hard work.
          ＊
    If you diligently weed the field,
    The crops will grow well;
    If you don't weed the field,
    The seeds are wasted.
          ＊
    One log cannot make a beam,
    One brick cannot build a wall.
          ＊
    The peony flower is beautiful,
    But it needs green leaves to set it off.
          ＊
    A drum won't sound if it's not beaten,
    A principle won't be clear if it's not explained.
          ＊
    Trees vary in size,
    People vary in height.
