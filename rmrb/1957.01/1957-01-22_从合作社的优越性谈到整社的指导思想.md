From the Superiority of Cooperatives to the Guiding Ideology of Cooperative Rectification
Zhang Yongchang

Recently, we have heard many people reflecting that since the realization of advanced cooperativization, the income of cooperative members has decreased, the lives of the masses have been lowered, and so on. Some individuals even say: "Advanced cooperatives are not as good as elementary cooperatives, elementary cooperatives are not as good as mutual aid teams, and mutual aid teams are not as good as individual households." There are many discussions.

At the beginning of last month, we went to seven counties in three special districts of Henan Province and focused on looking at some cooperatives and interviewing farmers. What we heard and saw was completely the opposite. The broad masses of farmers reflected that cooperativization is very good and has unparalleled superiority. They said, "Cooperativization is really good, digging up the roots of poverty and planting seedlings of wealth." The farmers in Yaowan Township, Gong County, summarized the benefits of advanced cooperativization as seven worries not and one fear not. The seven worries not are: not worrying about not having enough food to eat, not worrying about not having enough coal to burn, not worrying about not having enough money to spend, not worrying about not having seeds, not worrying about not having farm tools, not worrying about not having livestock to grind grain, and not worrying about not having children. The one fear not is: the strength of organization is great, and we are not afraid of natural and man-made disasters. The Xingfu No. 1 Cooperative in Lushan summarized ten benefits of cooperativization: (1) After cooperativization, large-scale basic construction can be carried out. The cooperative originally had twelve wells and nine waterwheels, and 90% of the land could not be irrigated. Last year, 29 new wells were dug, a new canal was built, 35 waterwheels and one water pump were purchased, and the irrigation area was expanded nine times, turning all the land in the cooperative into irrigated land. (2) Agricultural technology has been improved. Last year's sweet potatoes increased production by more than 180% due to the use of improved varieties and reasonable close planting. (3) Small plots of land were merged into large plots, small threshing grounds were merged into large threshing grounds, and roads were comprehensively planned. The cooperative expanded the cultivated land area by 535 mu. When planting wheat in 1956, mechanized farming was implemented. (4) Land can be planted according to local conditions. All 430 mu of sandy land in the cooperative were planted with sweet potatoes, and 140 mu of waterlogged land were all converted to dry rice. (5) Labor can be used according to talent and give play to expertise. Carpenters, blacksmiths, doctors, and intellectuals in the cooperative have all been reasonably arranged. (6) Production has increased. The average yield per mu in the cooperative was 319 jin the year before last, and the average yield per mu last year was 410 jin. (7) The income of cooperative members has increased. The income of 92% of the cooperative members increased compared with the year before last, of which 60.8% increased their income by more than 50%. (8) The material and cultural life of the cooperative members has been improved. (9) The socialist consciousness of the cooperative members has been unprecedentedly improved. (10) A large number of cadres have been trained, and the leadership of the cooperative has been strengthened. Some people may ask: What you are talking about are only individual good townships and good cooperatives, or even typical examples cultivated consciously by the leading organs. The situation in the whole province is not like this. Then let's take a look at the situation in the whole province. Due to the realization of cooperativization, Henan Province ensured increased production under the attack of severe natural disasters. All areas that did not suffer from natural disasters increased their yields compared with the year before last, and many counties and cooperatives achieved large-scale high yields. Seven counties in the province had an average yield of 478 jin per mu, an increase of 50% compared with 317 jin in 1955. In general cooperatives throughout the province, members whose income increased accounted for more than 70% of the total number of members, with the highest reaching 100%. A male full laborer can generally do about 240 labor days throughout the year, with each labor day generally worth about seven jiao, higher ones worth about one yuan, and the highest worth up to two yuan and five jiao. One laborer can generally support the lives of four people. With the development of production and the increase of cooperative members' income, the lives of farmers have also been improved accordingly. According to a survey of 19 cooperatives in Anyang area, the average annual living expenses of each member were 47.9 yuan the year before last, and the average per capita expenditure last year reached 57.59 yuan, an average increase of 20% compared with the year before last. In terms of grain distribution, the average amount of grain distributed to each person in a general cooperative is more than 400 jin, and more is distributed to 500 jin or 700 jin.

Last year, 50 million mu of land in the province suffered severe yield reductions due to major disasters, and the lives of farmers were indeed difficult. However, thanks to the strong support of the state and the great strength of the cooperatives in resisting natural disasters, the degree of famine has been greatly reduced.

The superiority of the cooperative system in developing productive forces is very significant. First, the labor attendance rate has been greatly improved. According to a survey of 12 cooperatives in the Nanyang area, the labor attendance rate of cooperative members was 72% the year before last and 87% last year, an increase of 15%. Second, after cooperativization, large-scale farmland water conservancy construction was carried out. The province had more than 7 million mu of irrigated land before liberation, and another 7 million mu was added after liberation until last year. In the year after cooperativization, the irrigated area was expanded by more than 26 million mu by means of well digging, canal opening, pond construction, and small reservoir construction. This figure is nearly twice the total historical accumulation before last year, and nearly four times that before liberation. At present, the irrigation capacity of various water conservancy facilities in the province can reach more than 40 million mu, which will account for 40% of the province's arable irrigated land area. Third, after cooperativization, it is easier to resist and overcome various natural disasters. Shaojie Cooperative in Kaifeng has suffered from floods every year and is a historically old disaster area. In the past, the masses requested to dig a canal, and after many discussions, no one was willing to have their land dug, so it was never dug. In the first year after cooperativization, it was dug. The digging of this canal saved 4,000 mu of land, turning a grain-deficient cooperative into a surplus-grain cooperative. Fourth, after cooperativization, cultivation techniques have been improved and advanced experiences have been popularized.

The superiority of the cooperative system is very obvious. However, why are some people still skeptical, wavering, or even resistant? On the one hand, it is because of insufficient leadership experience, and there are still many shortcomings and errors in the work; on the other hand, after the realization of advanced cooperativization in the countryside, although the majority of people have increased their income, some of the rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants have temporarily reduced their income in the first year of cooperativization, and their children studying in middle and higher schools will also feel the difficulty of paying expenses. They cannot see the more distant interests and will express dissatisfaction with cooperativization. It is also natural that individual idlers or people who live by speculation in the countryside are dissatisfied with cooperativization. Individual reactionary elements in the countryside, harboring sinister plots to use the dissatisfaction of a small number of rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants and the weaknesses in our work to stir up trouble and undermine the socialist system, have been found in individual places, which is one of the major reasons for creating an atmosphere of dissatisfaction with cooperativization. In addition, there are indeed some well-intentioned comrades who, seeing the current relatively difficult lives of farmers in disaster areas or seeing some relatively serious shortcomings in the work, have not conducted a specific analysis and have generated unnecessary worries. No matter which class or which people the above-mentioned thoughts and emotions come from, they objectively reflect the class consciousness of the rich peasants.

The above-mentioned views on cooperativization are also reflected in the work of rectifying cooperatives. At present, there are two different guiding ideologies in cooperative rectification: one is to use the ideological method of dialectical materialism, use the viewpoint of class analysis, rely on the party organization, rely on the masses, and sum up work in a pragmatic way. On the basis of affirming achievements, we should examine the shortcomings and problems existing in the work, specifically analyze the reasons, and study solutions. At the cadre meeting in Jia County, the achievements and experience of running cooperatives in the past year were summarized, the ten superiorities of cooperativization were affirmed, the negative emotions of some cadres were reversed, and the erroneous view of only looking at shortcomings and not at achievements was corrected. After the meeting, on the basis of unified thinking of the backbone, the propaganda was correctly carried out to the cadres and the masses, and the method of accounting and comparison was used to carry out education and enhance confidence. The Xuniuwa Cooperative in Linru County had a production team that did not produce well for eighteen days before the rectification. In the rectification, the achievements were summarized, a recollection and comparison was carried out, the line between right and wrong was drawn, and the enthusiasm for production was high, and the winter production movement was actively carried out. Experience has proved that this guiding ideology is correct.

The other is the guiding ideology of idealism and subjectivism: abandoning the party and league branches and cooperative cadres, not relying on the basic masses, but relying on people who have the most opinions on the cooperative, one-sidedly emphasizing the shortcomings of the cooperative, not daring to publicize the superiority of the cooperative to the masses, and adopting the method of simply "rectifying" cooperative cadres. In Huangzhuang Cooperative, Tianhu Township, Song County, Wan Zhongren, the former bao chief, took the lead and colluded with ten people who were dissatisfied with the cooperative, organized a "Ten-Person Delegation," sealed the cooperative's warehouse, and wanted to settle accounts with the cadres. The cadres who went to the township to rectify the cooperative relied on these ten "representatives" to carry out the rectification work. As a result, the cooperative cadres were afraid, the masses were dissatisfied, production was stagnant, and the rectification work could not be carried out. The cadres who went to the Erdaogou Cooperative in Yiyang County for rectification put the original cooperative cadres aside, "rooted and colluded" to collect materials, making the cooperative cadres and the masses confused, causing ideological confusion, and affecting production (both places were corrected by the county party committee in a timely manner). Facts have proved that this guiding ideology is wrong.

Judging from the situation in many places, the people who are currently dissatisfied with cooperativization are mainly rich peasants, well-to-do middle peasants, vagrants, idlers, and bad elements. Therefore, in the work of rectifying cooperatives, it is a serious mistake to specifically collect shortcomings in the work, rely on some people who are dissatisfied with agricultural cooperatives, and simply "rectify" cooperative cadres. Drawing a clear line between these two different guiding ideologies and distinguishing between right and wrong is extremely important in the current work of cooperative rectification.

    从合作社的优越性谈到整社的指导思想
    张永昌
    最近我们听到不少人反映：实现高级合作化以后，社员的收入减少了，群众的生活降低了，等等。个别人竟然说：“高级社不如初级社，初级社不如互助组，互助组不如单干户。”议论纷纷。
    上月初，我们到了河南省三个专区的七个县，有重点地看了一些合作社，访问了农民。我们所听到和看到的情况却完全相反。广大农民的反映是：合作化好得很，有不可比拟的优越性。他们说：“合作化真正好，挖掉穷根栽富苗。”巩县窑弯乡农民把高级合作化的好处总结为七不愁，一不怕。七不愁是：不愁没粮吃，不愁没煤烧，不愁没钱花，不愁没种子，不愁没农具，不愁没牲口推磨，不愁没儿女。一不怕是：组织起来力量大，天灾人祸都不怕。鲁山幸福一社给合作化总结出来十大好处：（1）合作化后能进行大规模的基本建设。全社原有十二眼井，九个水车，90％的土地不能灌溉。去年打新井二十九眼，修新渠一条，买水车三十五部，抽水机一部，灌溉面积扩大了九倍，全社土地都变成了水浇地。（2）提高了农业技术。去年的红薯，由于采用优良品种和合理密植，增产180％以上。（3）小块土地并成了大块，小场并成大场，道路进行了全面规划，全社共扩大耕地面积五百三十五亩。1956年种麦的时候，实行了机耕。（4）土地能够因地种植，全社四百三十亩黄沙岗地，全部种的红薯，一百四十亩易涝土地全部改种成旱稻。（5）劳动力能因才使用，发挥专长。全社木匠、铁匠、医生、知识分子都得到合理安排。（6）增加了生产。前年全社每亩平均产量三百一十九斤，去年每亩平均产量四百一十斤。（7）社员增加了收入。全社有92％的社员收入比前年增加，其中增加收入在50％以上的占60.8％。（8）提高了社员的物质文化生活。（9）社员的社会主义觉悟空前提高。（10）培养了大批的干部，壮大了社的领导力量。有人会问：你说的只是个别的好乡和好社，甚至是领导机关有意识地培养出来的典型，全省情况并非如此。那末我们就看看全省的情况吧。由于实现了合作化，河南全省在严重的自然灾害的袭击下，保证了增产。凡是没有遭受自然灾害的地区，产量都比前年提高，并且出现了不少整县、整社的大面积丰产。全省有七个县每亩平均产量达四百七十八斤，比1955年三百一十七斤增产50％。全省一般的合作社增加收入的社员都占社员总数的70％以上，最高的占100％。全年男整劳动力一般可做二百四十个左右的劳动日，一般的每个劳动日七角钱左右，较高的一元左右，最高的到二元五角。一个劳动力一般的可以维持四口人的生活。随着生产的发展和社员收入的增加，农民的生活也得到相应的改善。据安阳地区十九个社的调查：前年平均每个社员全年生活开支四十七点九元，去年平均每人开支达五十七点五九元。比前年平均提高20％。在粮食的分配上，一般的社每个人都平均分粮食四百斤以上，多者分到五百斤、七百斤。
    去年全省有五千万亩土地因特大灾害而严重减产，农民的生活是有不少的困难的。但是，由于国家的大力扶持和合作社抵抗自然灾害的力量大，大大减轻了灾荒的程度。
    合作社制度在发展生产力方面的优越性是很显著的。首先是劳动出勤率有很大提高。据南阳地区十二个社的调查：社员的劳动出勤率前年是72％，去年是87％，提高了15％。第二，合作化后，进行了规模巨大的农田水利建设。全省解放前水浇地七百余万亩，解放后至去年又增加七百余万亩。合作化后的一年中就用打井、开渠、修塘、修小水库等办法，扩大水浇地二千六百余万亩，这个数字等于去年以前全部历史积累的近二倍，等于解放前的近四倍。目前全省各项水利设备的灌溉能力共可达四千余万亩，将占全省可耕水浇地面积的40％。第三，合作化后，便于抗拒和战胜各种自然灾害。开封邵街社，年年遭水灾，是历史上的老灾区，过去群众曾要求挖一条渠，商量了很多次，挖谁的地谁都不愿意，一直没有挖成，合作化后的第一年就挖成了。挖了这条渠，救出四千亩土地，使缺粮社变为余粮社。第四，合作化后改进了耕作技术，推广了先进经验。
    合作制度的优越性是很显然的。但是，为甚么还有一些人怀疑、动摇，甚至有抵触情绪呢？一方面因为领导经验不足，工作中还有许多缺点和错误；另一方面，在农村实现高级合作化后，虽然大多数人增加了收入，但在富农、富裕中农里面，在合作化的第一年，有一部分人暂时减少了收入，他们的子女在中等以上的学校读书的，也会感到用费的困难；他们看不到更远大的利益，会对合作化表示不满。农村中的个别的懒汉或靠搞投机勾当过生活的人对合作化不满，也是很自然的。农村中个别的反动分子，怀着阴谋毒计利用少数富农、富裕中农的不满和我们工作中的弱点来兴风作浪，破坏社会主义制度，在个别的地方已经发见，这更是造成对合作化不满的空气的重大原因之一。另外，也的确有一部分好心肠的同志，看到灾区农民现在生活比较困苦，或看到工作中某些比较严重的缺点，没有进行具体分析，而产生不应有的忧虑。无论上述的思想和情绪，来自哪个阶层，来自哪一些人，它在客观上都反映着富农的阶级意识。
    上面所说对合作化的看法，也反映到整顿合作社的工作中来。当前整社中有这样两种不同的指导思想：一种是用辩证唯物主义的思想方法，用阶级分析的观点，依靠党的组织，依靠群众，实事求是地总结工作，在肯定成绩的基础上，检查工作中存在的缺点和问题，具体分析原因，研究解决办法。郏县在县的整党整社骨干会议上，总结一年来的办社成绩和经验，肯定了合作化的十大优越性，扭转了某些干部的消极情绪，纠正了只看缺点不看成绩的错误观点。会后，在骨干思想统一的基础上，正确地向干部和群众进行了宣传，用算账对比的办法，进行教育，提高了信心。临汝许牛娃合作社，在整社前有一个生产队十八天没有好好生产。在整社中，总结了成绩，进行了回忆对比，划清了是非界限，生产情绪高涨起来，积极开展了冬季生产运动。经验证明，这种指导思想是正确的。
    另一种是唯心主义的主观主义的指导思想：抛开党、团支部和社干部，不依靠基本群众，而依靠对合作社意见最多的人，片面地强调合作社的缺点，不敢向群众宣传合作社的优越性，采取单纯“整”社干部的办法。嵩县田户乡黄庄合作社，以过去的保长万中仁为首，串连了十个对合作社不满的人，组织了“十人代表团”，封了合作社的仓库，要找干部算帐。而到该乡去整社的干部，就依靠这十个“代表”进行整社工作。结果是社干部害怕，群众不满，生产停顿，整社工作无法进行。到宜阳二道沟合作社去整社的干部，把原有社干部抛到一边，“扎根串连”搜集材料，弄得社干部和群众莫名其妙，引起思想混乱，影响了生产（两处都由县委及时纠正了）。事实证明，这种指导思想是错误的。
    从许多地方的情况看，现在对合作化不满的人，主要是富农、富裕中农、二流子懒汉和坏分子。因此，在整顿合作社的工作中，专门搜集工作中的缺点，依靠对农业社心怀不满的一些人，单纯“整”社干部，就要犯严重的错误。划清这两种不同的指导思想，分清是非界限，在当前整社工作中是极为重要的。
