Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Various non-staple foods for people throughout urban and rural areas of the country to celebrate the Spring Festival have already been on the market in large quantities.

As of now, the total inventory of live pigs nationwide has increased by 20% compared to the same period last year, cattle by more than 30%, and sheep by 130%. The China Food Company plans to supply more than 40% more pigs (in terms of number) for the Spring Festival than last year's Spring Festival. Because the number of pigs raised varies, and some places have transportation difficulties, the supply in various places is different. Generally speaking, residents in large and medium-sized cities across the country can eat an average of about 1.5 jin of pork per person during the Spring Festival, and residents in small cities and rural areas can eat an average of about 1 jin per person. The supply of beef and mutton is also very large. The beef and mutton needed by the Hui people in the cities for the festival will be fully supplied by the food company. There are even more poultry than in previous years. The three major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai have increased by 40% to more than two times compared to last year. In addition, there are a large number of pheasants and wild chickens.

The supply of aquatic products is also more than last year's Spring Festival. The main producing areas, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong and other provinces have sufficient supplies. For the inland areas, the aquatic products department will also try its best to supply them. Now, in some cities in Qinghai, you can buy ice-fresh fish and frozen prawns transported from the coast, and you can also buy kelp and other seafood in some industrial and mining areas in Gansu.

The quantity of vegetables is also sufficient. People in cities such as Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, Anshan, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan can eat an average of 1 jin of vegetables per person per day during the Spring Festival. In northern cities, people can also buy fresh vegetables transported from Guangdong, and the price is cheaper than in previous years. A considerable amount of other groceries and sweets are also prepared. Beijing supplied only 78 kinds of dried vegetables, seasonings, and pickles during last year's Spring Festival, which has increased to 152 kinds this year.

Cigarettes and alcohol can be supplied in large quantities everywhere. After the supply of the two famous cigarettes, "Chunghwa" and "Double Happiness," decreased due to insufficient raw materials, the newly produced high-grade cigarettes, "Phoenix" and "Peony," are being sold in large quantities on the market and are gradually becoming popular among consumers.

In order to enable the broad masses of the people to have a good festival, the troops and many organs and groups have proposed to appropriately economize during the Spring Festival and buy less non-staple food. State-owned commercial departments will compress the supply to troops, organs, and groups for certain non-staple foods that the masses need but are in short supply, and supply more to residents. Beijing has decided to supply pork to troops, organs, and groups according to the same standards as ordinary citizens. Hubei Province gives priority to supplying brown sugar, which is in short supply, to rural areas, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also gives priority to supplying brown sugar to agricultural and pastoral areas.

    保证全国城乡人民高高兴兴过春节
    各种副食品已大量应市
    中国食品公司准备供应的生猪比去年春节增加40％以上
    新华社26日讯　供应全国城乡人民欢度春节的各种副食品已大量应市。
    到现在止，全国各地库存的生猪总量比去年同期增加20％，牛增加30％多，羊增加130％。中国食品公司准备春节供应的猪（以头数计）比去年春节多40％以上。因为养猪数量有多有少，再加以有些地方运输困难，各地供应量不一样，总的说来，全国大中城市的居民在春节期间平均每人能吃到猪肉一斤半左右，小城市和农村居民平均每人能吃到一斤左右。牛羊肉的供应量也很大，城市中的回族人民过节需要的牛羊肉，将由食品公司充分地供应。家禽比往年增加的更多，北京、天津、上海三大城市比去年增加40％到二倍以上。此外还有大量的山鸡、野鸡。
    水产品的供应量也比去年春节要多。主要产地浙江、江苏、山东等省货源充足。对于内地，水产部门也尽量予以供应。现在青海的一些城市里，可以买到沿海运去的冰鲜鱼和冰对虾，在甘肃的一些工矿区也可以买到海带等海味品。
    蔬菜的数量也是充足的，沈阳、哈尔滨、长春、鞍山、北京、天津、上海、武汉等城市的人民在春节期间每人每天平均可以吃到一斤蔬菜。在北方各城市里，人们还可以买到广东运去的时鲜蔬菜，价钱比往年要便宜。其他杂货和糖果糕点也准备了相当数量。北京去年春节时供应的干菜、调味品和酱腌菜只有七十八种，今年增加到一百五十二种。
    烟酒各地都可以大量供应。“中华”和“双喜”两种名烟，因为原料不足供应量减少后，新产的高级香烟——“凤凰”和“牡丹”，市场上正大量地出售，并逐渐受到消费者欢迎。
    为了使广大人民群众过好这个节日，部队和许多机关、团体，提出在春节期间适当节约，少买副食品。国营商业部门对某些群众需要而货源又有困难的副食品，将压缩部队、机关、团体的供应量，多供应居民一些。北京市已经决定对部队、机关、团体需要的猪肉，以同市民一样的标准供应。湖北省把货源不足的红糖优先供应农村，内蒙古自治区也把红糖优先供应农业区和牧区。
