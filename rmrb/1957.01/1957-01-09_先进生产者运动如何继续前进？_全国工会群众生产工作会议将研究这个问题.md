Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The National Trade Union Mass Production Work Conference opened in Beijing today. This conference will summarize the situation, achievements, and problems in the development of the advanced producers movement over the past year; and study how the advanced producers movement can continue to develop in depth on the existing basis in response to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to increase production and practice economy. The competition among clerical staff will also be emphasized, studied, and resolved at this conference.

Wang Jiayang, Director of the Production Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a report at today's meeting.

In his report, Wang Jiayang first talked about the situation and achievements of the advanced producers movement last year. He said that the effect of the advanced producers movement last year was very significant. Across the country, from large cities to small and medium-sized towns, the broad masses of workers in industry, transportation, commerce, and some cultural, educational, and health departments were all involved in this vigorous mass movement. The tremendous achievements in industrial production and construction last year are inseparable from the advanced producers movement. In this movement, various localities have summarized and promoted many advanced experiences. According to incomplete statistics from fourteen industries, including the First Machine, Coal, Geology, and Electric Power industries, in the first half of last year alone, a total of 5,689 advanced experiences were summarized and promoted. Last year, the staff and workers of the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry increased the production of pig iron by more than 110,000 tons simply by promoting advanced experiences such as the rapid combustion method for hot blast stoves. The staff and workers of the coal mining system universally promoted the advanced experience of the Soviet one-shift coal mining system, increasing production efficiency by 20% to 25%. The promotion of advanced experience has also played a significant role in improving quality and saving resources. With the promotion of advanced experience, mass technical mutual assistance and technical learning have also become very active. The contracts for technical mutual assistance and mutual learning are also becoming more and more diversified. In the past, generally only "brother contracts," "sister contracts," and "master-apprentice contracts" were used. Now there are contracts signed between workers and technicians. There are also mutual assistance contracts between groups and groups, workshops and workshops, and factories and factories. The work of rationalization proposals has also greatly developed and improved. According to incomplete statistics from the first half of last year, the staff and workers across the country put forward more than 1.3 million rationalization proposals, of which more than 680,000 have been adopted. According to statistics that can calculate the value of these adopted rationalization proposals, they have created a total of more than 250 million yuan of wealth for the country. After the advanced producers movement was launched, clerical work has generally attracted attention, especially since the third quarter of last year, clerical competition has also greatly developed.

In his report, Wang Jiayang pointed out the problems existing in the current advanced producers movement. He said that although the achievements of the advanced producers movement are significant and the movement is gradually deepening, judging from the current situation, the development of the movement is still very unbalanced, and there are still many problems. In the entire movement, although a lot of political and ideological education work has been done, it is still not detailed enough. We have not done enough to educate the workers on the relationship between production and life, and the relationship between individuals and collectives. Due to the weakness of ideological education work, some advanced producers have become arrogant and complacent, and their work has stagnated. The second is that the implementation of the policy of "more, faster, better, more economical, and safer" is not comprehensive enough. In the movement, there is a phenomenon of pursuing more and faster, and neglecting better, more economical, and safer. In the summary and promotion of advanced experiences, there have been formalism problems of pursuing quantity, neglecting specific conditions, and mechanically copying. The promotion of some advanced experiences has actually increased labor intensity. In the work of rationalization proposals, many are proposed, but few are realized, and the reward work for rationalization proposals is not done well enough. The advanced producers movement in some enterprises is not well integrated with the requirements of enterprise management. The organizational leadership work of socialist emulation is still weak.

In response to the above-mentioned situations and problems, Wang Jiayang put forward suggestions in the last part of his report on how the advanced producers movement can be consolidated, developed, and continued to move forward in the new situation this year. These suggestions will be discussed at the meeting.

    先进生产者运动如何继续前进？
    全国工会群众生产工作会议将研究这个问题
    据新华社7日讯　全国工会群众生产工作会议今天在北京开幕。这次会议将总结去年一年间先进生产者运动开展的情况、成绩和问题；研究先进生产者运动在现有的基础上如何响应中共中央增产节约的号召继续深入开展的问题。科室工作人员的竞赛问题，也将在这次会议上着重地加以研究和解决。
    全国总工会生产部部长王家扬在今天的会议上作了报告。
    王家扬在报告中首先谈到去年先进生产者运动开展的情况和成就。他说，去年全国先进生产者运动的效果是很显著的。全国从大城市到中小城镇不论工业、交通运输、商业或某些文教卫生部门的广大职工都卷入了这个轰轰烈烈的群众运动中。去年工业生产和建设的巨大成就，是同先进生产者运动分不开的。在这个运动中各地总结和推广了许多先进经验。仅据第一机械、煤矿、地质、电力等十四个产业去年上半年的不完全统计，共总结和推广了五千六百八十九种先进经验。去年冶金工业部钢铁工业管理局系统的职工由于推广热风炉快速燃烧法等先进经验，仅生铁即增产十一万多吨。煤矿系统的职工普遍推广了苏联一班采煤制的先进经验，提高生产效率20％到25％。推广先进经验对提高质量和节约也都起了很大作用。随着先进经验的推广，群众性的技术互助和技术学习也非常活跃。技术互助互学的合同也愈来愈多样化。过去一般只采用“兄弟合同”、“姐妹合同”和“师徒合同”，现在出现了工人和技术人员之间签定的合同。还有小组和小组、车间和车间、厂和厂的互助合同等。合理化建议的工作也有很大的发展和提高。根据去年上半年的不完全统计，全国职工共提出合理化建议一百三十多万件，其中已经采纳的有六十八万多件。这些已经采纳的合理化建议，以其能计算价值的统计，总共为国家创造的财富达两亿五千多万元。先进生产者运动开展以后，科室工作已经普遍引起重视，特别是去年第三季度以来科室竞赛也有了很大发展。
    王家扬在报告中指出了目前先进生产者运动存在的问题。他说，虽然先进生产者运动的成绩是显著的，运动是逐步深入的，但从目前的情况看来，运动的发展仍然很不平衡，存在的问题也是不少的。在整个运动中，政治思想教育工作虽然做得很多，但是还不够细致。我们对工人群众进行生产和生活的关系、个人和集体的关系的教育都不够。由于思想教育工作薄弱，有些先进生产者就骄傲自满起来，工作停滞不前。其次是贯彻“多、快、好、省、安全”的方针还不够全面。在运动中有追求多、快，忽视好、省、安全的现象。在总结和推广先进经验中曾经发生过追求数量，忽视具体条件，生搬硬套的形式主义的毛病。有些先进经验的推广反而有提高劳动强度的现象。在合理化建议的工作中，提的多，实现的少，合理化建议的奖励工作也做得不够好。有些企业的先进生产者运动没有很好结合企业的经营管理的要求。社会主义竞赛的组织领导工作还薄弱。
    针对上述情况和问题，王家扬在报告的最后一部分，对今年在新的形势下先进生产者运动如何巩固发展和继续前进的问题，提出了意见。这些意见将在会议上讨论。
