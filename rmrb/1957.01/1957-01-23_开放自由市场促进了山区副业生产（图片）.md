    Open Free Markets Promote Sideline Production in Mountainous Areas
    After the opening of rural free markets, sideline production in mountainous areas of Fujian Province has become very active. Native paper, which was previously in short supply in the market, can now be supplied adequately. This is native paper and bamboo hats at the Jianyang County market. Photo by Ouyang Ying
