Xinhua News Agency, January 2nd dispatch: According to TASS, New York, January 1st: Many American newspapers have commented on the new U.S. plan in the Near East.

    The "New York Herald Tribune" published an article by Lippmann. Lippmann wrote that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is nothing more than a revamped version of the Truman Doctrine. He said that the reason it was necessary to proclaim this doctrine again was because during the presidential election, the Republicans portrayed Eisenhower as a "guardian of peace." "An impression has now been created, especially abroad, that the president is a pacifist and that he tends to be neutral on many Middle Eastern issues that are of major concern to Europe. This impression is clearly incorrect."
    An editorial in the "Daily Worker" pointed out that the proposals now put forward by the U.S. government violate its pre-election guarantees not to use American troops in the Middle East and that the United States supported UN actions to maintain peace. The true purpose of the government's plan is now becoming increasingly clear. This purpose is: to attempt to achieve through aggressive means (eliminating the anti-colonial revolutionary movement for national independence sweeping the entire Middle East) what cannot be achieved. Behind this purpose lies the determination of the American oil tycoons to maintain their privileges in the Middle East and the profits derived from colonial exploitation, and to seize what can be seized from British and French oil industry rivals.
Xinhua News Agency, January 2nd dispatch: London News: The London "Times" believes that the U.S. President's request to Congress to grant "standby power" to use force in the Middle East is an irony of the hypocritical posture it had taken in the previous period.

    The newspaper's Washington correspondent wrote on December 29: "Such an action (requesting the granting of 'standby power' to use force) would completely change the new policy adopted by the (U.S.) government of referring everything to the United Nations, denying all the moral platitudes sounded by Vice President Nixon and Dulles. Moreover, the threat of the use of force implied therein is an extremely ridiculous commentary on the severe measures taken by Washington to crush the military actions of Britain and France."
    The "Sunday Express" reported that the news that Eisenhower might request the granting of "standby power" to use force has "astonished Eden and his advisors." It said that some British ministers are privately raising, and some Conservative MPs will publicly raise, the question: "Why is the United States now prepared to take this stance after Britain's influence and power in the Middle East have been utterly lost as a result of the Suez adventure?"
    The newspaper also pointed out that the United States cannot be expected to help Britain resolve the canal issue.
Xinhua News Agency, January 2nd dispatch: Paris News: The Paris "Le Monde" commented on December 31 on the "Eisenhower Doctrine" that the United States is preparing to promote in the Middle East, saying that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is a revised version of the 1947 "Truman Doctrine." The United States is attempting to use the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to further obtain "political and ideological interests" in the Middle East, and to replace the waning influence of Britain and France with the influence of the U.S. government.

    The commentary then discussed the "Third Force" and the formation of a unified body in Europe. It said that when entering 1957, the "European idea" is clearly "attractive." It believes that there is still a need today for a "genuine" Europe that "relies only on itself."

    美英法报纸的评论
    暴露出“艾森豪威尔主义”的伪善面目
    据新华社2日讯　据塔斯社纽约1日讯：美国许多报刊就美国在近东的新计划发表评论。
      “纽约先驱论坛报”刊载了李普曼的一篇文章。李普曼写道，“艾森豪威尔主义”不过是杜鲁门主义的翻版而已。他说，所以有必要再宣扬一次这种主义，是因为在竞选总统的时候，共和党人把艾森豪威尔说成是“和平的保卫者”。“现在已经造成了一种印象，特别是在国外，那就是总统是一个和平主义者，他在同欧洲有重大关系的许多中东问题上，大都是倾向于中立主义。这种印象显然是不正确的。”
      “工人日报”编辑部的文章指出，美国政府现在提出的建议，违反了它在选举前提出的不在中东使用美国军队和美国支持联合国维护和平的行动的保证。政府计划的真实目的现在越来越明显了。这个目的就是：企图取得用侵略手段（消灭整个中东掀起的争取民族独立的反殖民主义革命运动）所不能得到的东西。在这个目的的后面隐藏着美国石油大王的这样一种决心：要保持自己在中东的特权和从殖民剥削中得来的利润，并且夺取可以从英国和法国石油业竞争对手那里夺取到的东西。
    据新华社2日讯　伦敦消息：伦敦“泰晤士报”认为美国总统要求国会授予在中东使用武力的“备用权”，是对它前一个时期所作出的伪善姿态的一种讽刺。
    这家报纸12月29日发表的华盛顿通讯写道：“这样一种行动（要求授予使用武力‘备用权’）将完全改变（美国）政府所采取的把所有事情都交由联合国解决的新政策，否认尼克松副总统和杜勒斯所弹的一切道德滥调。此外，其中所暗含的使用武力的威胁，几乎是对华盛顿为了粉碎英法两国的军事行动而采取的严厉措施的极其可笑的注释。”
    “星期日快报”报道说，关于艾森豪威尔可能要求授予使用武力“备用权”的消息，使“艾登和他的顾问们感到惊异”。它说，英国一些大臣正在私下提出而一些保守党议员将要公开提出这样一个问题：“在英国在中东的影响和力量由于苏伊士冒险的后果而丧失殆尽以后，为什么美国现在竟准备采取这种立场呢？”
    这家报纸同时指出，不能指望美国帮助英国解决运河问题。
    新华社2日讯　巴黎消息：12月31日的巴黎“世界报”就美国准备在中东推行的“艾森豪威尔主义”发表评论说，“艾森豪威尔主义”是1947年“杜鲁门主义”的翻版。美国企图利用“艾森豪威尔主义”来进一步在中东取得“政治上和思想上的利益”，并且以美国政府的影响来代替英法丧失中的影响。
    评论接着谈到“第三种力量”和欧洲形成一个统一体的问题。它说，在跨入1957年的时候，“欧洲观念”显然是“吸引人的”。它认为今天仍然需要一个“真正的”、“只是依靠自身”的欧洲。
