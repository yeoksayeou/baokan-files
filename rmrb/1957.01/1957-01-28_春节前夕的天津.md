    Tianjin on the Eve of the Spring Festival
    Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Tianjin
    These days have been particularly warm, the ice and snow have melted, and Tianjin is showing a festive scene.
    Abundant New Year Goods
    Tianjin has begun supplying New Year's goods since the 24th. Vegetables, meat, and dried and fresh goods are piled high in various food markets and stores, and salespeople are enthusiastically receiving the endless stream of customers. Various refrigerated trucks and trucks from meat processing plants and cold storage warehouses are coming and going. Suburban farmers are also busy transporting vegetables to the city day and night. According to the person in charge of relevant departments, the supply of pork for this year's Spring Festival is one-third more than last year, and the supply of beef and mutton has doubled. The city averages two pounds of meat per person. To do a good job in supply, more than 3,000 administrative cadres in the city are prepared to help with sales in retail units.
    Tianjin's traditional "New Year Market" – the Tianhou Temple area – also has a different scene this year. Many New Year picture shops, firecracker shops, and lantern shops attract a large number of customers. A large group of girls from the countryside stood in front of the gorgeously dazzling velvet flower stalls, reluctant to leave; elderly women also put on their reading glasses to select window decorations.

    Frugal Holiday
    People are planning to spend the Spring Festival frugally. Zhang Wenyu, a resident of Yude Lane, originally planned to buy thirty to forty pounds of pork before the Spring Festival to pickle, and spend more than ten yuan to buy velvet flowers and fresh flowers, and also planned to make a new leather coat. Now he realizes that this is extravagance and waste, so he decided not to pickle pork, but only make some other New Year dishes. He also saved the money for making a leather coat and buying velvet flowers, and deposited the remaining eighty yuan into the bank the next day. According to statistics from the Savings Department of the People's Bank of China, as of the 18th of this month, the city's people's savings deposits had reached 86,190,000 yuan, an increase of 190,000 yuan compared with the end of last year, reversing the usual situation of more withdrawals than deposits before the Spring Festival in previous years. In the Zhongshanmen Workers' New Village in Tianjin, where more than 40,000 workers and their families live, every household has held a discussion on how to spend the festival frugally. Wei Jiaolin, who lives in Jiqing Lane, said: "This year's atmosphere has changed. Saving money is not enough. The arrangements for the holidays are more organized than any other year."

    Everywhere is Joy
    Spring Festival entertainment activities have become active throughout the city. In some worker-populated areas of Heping District and Hongqiao District, bursts of gongs and drums are heard from time to time. Some stilt teams, land boats, and small cart dances are stepping up rehearsals in preparation for parades and performances on the streets during the Spring Festival. The two Workers' Cultural Palaces have been busy arranging rich and colorful entertainment programs for employees as early as a week ago.
    Many social figures are also rehearsing Peking Opera intensely. Although they are all over fifty years old, they are all full of energy and diligently practicing their postures and dance moves. A Peking Opera "Dragon and Phoenix Auspiciousness" jointly performed by workers and capitalists will be one of the eye-catching programs in the Spring Festival gala held by the Second Cultural Palace.

    Army-People Get-Togethers
    "Don't forget the well-digger when drinking water." Before the arrival of the Spring Festival, the delegation from all walks of life in Tianjin, which had just returned from visiting the People's Liberation Army on the coastal defense front, has launched army-people get-together activities throughout the city. Some amateur theater troupes and cultural work troupes are busy rehearsing wonderful programs for the People's Liberation Army, and they have scheduled the get-together until February 10. Four districts have already held get-togethers with the People's Liberation Army.
    The employees of various factories are also preparing to invite the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army to enjoy their amateur art performances during the Spring Festival. The employees of the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory have sent an invitation to a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, inviting them to the factory's club to celebrate the festival. Military dependents and martyrs' families are all distinguished guests at these get-togethers. Responsible cadres from various districts and streets are preparing to congratulate them on the Spring Festival.

    Seniors Welcome the Spring
    The activities to welcome the Spring Festival in the nursing homes are as lively as elsewhere. A group of elderly women over the age of eighty are sitting together cutting window decorations. An eighty-four-year-old woman noticed that the reporter was looking at a rooster she had cut out, and said shyly with a smile: "I learned this when I was young, and now I have forgotten it." In the club hanging with colorful paper flowers, Zhang Shacheng, 66, was wearing reading glasses and writing Spring Festival couplets. Some were also making lanterns, preparing to hold a get-together with the children of the children's home during the Spring Festival.

    春节前夕的天津
    新华社驻天津记者
    这几天特别暖和，冰雪已经融化，天津市呈现出一片节日景象。
    年货充足
    从24日开始，天津已开始供应年货。蔬菜、肉类和干鲜货堆满了各个菜市场和商店，售货员们热情地接待着接踵而来的顾客。来自肉类加工厂和食品冷藏仓库的各种冷藏车、卡车来往奔驰。郊区农民们也在不分昼夜地忙着往市里运送蔬菜。据有关方面的负责人告诉记者，今年春节的猪肉供应量比去年多三分之一，牛、羊肉增加了一倍，全市平均每人可以买到两斤肉。为了作好供应工作，全市有三千多行政干部准备到零售单位帮助售货。
    天津传统的“年市”——天后宫一带，今年也另有一番景象。许多年画片、鞭炮店和彩灯店吸引着大批顾客。一大群来自农村的姑娘站在华丽夺目的绒花摊前舍不得离开；老大娘们也戴起老花眼镜在挑选窗花。简朴过节
    人们都计划着简朴过春节。裕德里居民张文玉，本来计划在春节前，买上三、四十斤猪肉腌起来，还要花十多元去买绒花和鲜花，并准备做一件新皮袄，现在他认识到这是铺张浪费现象，就决定不腌猪肉，只做些别的年菜，做皮袄和买绒花的钱也省了下来，第二天就把这八十多元余款存入银行。根据人民银行储蓄部统计，在本月18日全市人民储蓄的存款已达到八千六百一十九万元，比去年年底增加了十九万元，改变了往年春节前照例付多收少的现象。有四万多个工人和家属居住的天津中山门工人新村，家家户户都开了座谈会，讨论如何简朴过节。住在吉庆里的魏焦林说：“今年的风气可变啦，省了钱还不算，日子安排的比哪一年都有条有理。”处处欢乐
    春节文娱活动已在全市活跃起来。在和平区和红桥区的一些工人聚居的地方，不时传出阵阵的锣鼓声，一些准备着春节期间到街上去作游行演出的高跷队、旱船和小车舞正在加紧排练。两座工人文化宫早在一个星期以前，就忙着为职工们安排丰富多采的文娱节目。
    许多社会人士也在紧张地排练京剧，他们虽然都是五十岁以上的人，但是个个精神饱满，认真地操练着身段和舞姿。一出由工人和资本家合演的京剧“龙凤呈祥”将是第二文化宫所举办的春节联欢中引人注意的节目之一。
    军民联欢
    “喝水不忘掏井人”，在春节来临之前，天津市各界人士组成的慰问团刚从海防前线慰问解放军归来，春节军民联欢活动又在全市展开了。一些业余剧团和文工团正忙着给解放军排演精彩的节目，他们把联欢日程一直排到2月10日，有四个区已和解放军举行了联欢会。
    各工厂的职工们也正在准备请解放军官兵在春节期间来欣赏他们的业余艺术表演。国营天津第二棉纺织厂的职工们已经向解放军某部队发出邀请，请他们到工厂的俱乐部来欢庆节日。军属和烈属都是这些联欢会的贵宾。各区、街的负责干部正准备去向他们祝贺春节。
    老人迎春
    安老院里迎接春节的活动，和别处一样地热烈。一群八十岁以上的老大娘正围坐在一起剪窗花，一个八十四岁的老大娘发现记者在看她剪出来的一只公鸡时，不好意思地笑着说：“这都是我年轻时学会的，现在都忘了。”在悬挂着彩色纸花的俱乐部里，六十六岁的张沙程戴着老花眼镜，在挥笔书写对联。还有的在制作彩灯，准备在春节同儿童教养院的孩子们举行联欢。
