Title: Not Letting Go of Any Wasteful Loopholes

    On January 18th, all the workers in the insulation workshop of the Shenyang Transformer Factory unanimously elected the workshop's veteran worker, Wang Qi, as an advanced producer for 1956.

    "Saving has become Wang Qi's habit!" The insulation workshop workers all praised Wang Qi in unison. Not wasting a single drop of alcohol or insulating paint, and even actively finding ways to make one piece of sandpaper or cloth do the work of two – this has indeed become Wang Qi's habit.

    Last summer, an inconspicuous phenomenon aroused Wang Qi's interest: why were the bakelite tubes dipped in paint first so smooth, while those dipped later were not?

    After pondering for several days, Wang Qi discovered that after being dipped in paint, the bakelite tubes had to be placed on a sieve to drain for about ten minutes. During these ten minutes, the dipping tank had to be left open; because of the hot weather, the alcohol evaporated, and the good insulating paint became increasingly thick, so the bakelite tubes dipped later were not smooth. He found a thin iron plate and suggested that the dipping tank be covered when not in use. This would reduce the evaporation of more than eighty jin of alcohol per month, and the quality of the bakelite tubes dipped later would also improve.

    As soon as the weather cooled down, Wang Qi discovered that when pouring insulating paint, the dipping workers turned the paint buckets upside down until not a single drop dripped out; however, a layer of sticky insulating paint still stuck to the inside of the bucket, and it was difficult to reach in and dig it out, so everyone felt powerless.

    At this time, Wang Qi had a stroke of genius. He remembered that insulating paint stuck to his hands could be washed off with alcohol. If some alcohol were poured into the empty bucket, it would definitely dissolve that layer of paint. So he suggested pouring some alcohol into the empty bucket to dissolve the insulating paint solidified in the bucket. Soon, his suggestion was adopted. In this way, more than one kilogram of insulating paint could be brushed down from an empty bucket.

    Before the bakelite tubes are dipped in paint, they must be wiped clean with white cloth dipped in gasoline. At the beginning of last year, more than ten chi of white cloth were used per month. Later, Wang Qi took the lead in washing the dirty cloth clean and reusing it. In December of last year, only five chi of white cloth were used for the entire month. He also suggested cutting a piece of sandpaper into four small pieces for use, so that the corners and edges of the sandpaper were used.

    Last year, Wang Qi came up with many ways to save. Like a housewife who is good at managing the household, he did not let go of any loopholes that could lead to waste. He often told the workers in his dipping group: when living at home, if a piece of coal or a grain of rice falls, we hurry to pick it up; when producing in the factory, we should be as careful as when living at home.

### 不放过任何浪费的漏洞

    不放过任何浪费的漏洞
    新华社记者　王殿学
    1月18日，沈阳变压器厂绝缘车间的全体工人，一致把车间的老师傅王琦推选为1956年的先进生产者。
    “节约已经成为王琦的习惯了！”绝缘车间工人都异口同声地这样称赞王琦。不损失一滴酒精、一滴绝缘漆，即使一块砂纸、一块布，也积极设法使它顶两块用，这的确已经成为王琦的习惯。
    去年夏天，有一个不引人注意的现象，却引起了王琦的兴趣：先浸完漆的电木管很光滑，后浸完漆的电木管为什么就不那样光滑呢？
    王琦琢磨几天以后发现：浸完漆的电木管，要放在筛子上控十来分钟，这十来分钟浸漆箱就得敞着；由于天气热，酒精挥发，好的绝缘漆便愈来愈浓，后浸完漆的电木管就不光滑了。他找来一块薄铁板，建议在不浸漆的时候，一定把浸漆箱盖好，这样一个月就少挥发八十多斤酒精，而且后浸漆的电木管的质量也好了。
    天刚一凉，王琦又发现倒绝缘漆的时候，浸漆工人都把漆桶翻成底朝上，直到控的一滴都不滴才算完事；可是，桶里还粘着一层粘呼呼的绝缘漆，伸手去挖，又很困难，因此大家认为再也无能为力了。
    这时王琦急中生智，他想起粘在手上的绝缘漆，用酒精一洗就掉了，如果往空桶里洒进些酒精去，一定也会把那层漆溶解下来。于是他建议往空桶里洒进些酒精，溶解凝固在桶里的绝缘漆。很快地，他的建议被采纳了。这样，一个空桶可以多刷下一公斤多绝缘漆。
    电木管浸漆之前，要用白布蘸汽油擦干净。去年年初，一个月要用十多尺白布。后来王琦带头把脏布洗干净再用，去年12月全月只用了五尺白布。他还建议把一块砂纸裁成四小块用，这样就把砂纸的角和边都用上了。
    去年一年，王琦接连想出很多节约的办法。他像一个善于理家的主妇一样，不放过任何一个可能浪费的漏洞。他常常这样向他领导的浸漆小组工人宣传：在家里过日子，掉一块煤或一粒米都赶忙拣起来；在工厂里生产，也应该像在家里过日子一样仔细。
