Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 26th: According to Vietnam News Agency on January 26th, General Võ Nguyên Giáp, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army, wrote to the Chairman of the International Commission for Vietnam on January 23rd, stating that it is necessary for the delegation of the High Command of the Vietnam People's Army to the Central Joint Commission and the French delegation to make contact to discuss the resumption of normal activities of the Central Joint Commission and related institutions. These activities were suspended after the withdrawal of the French Union forces from South Vietnam in April of last year.

In his letter, Võ Nguyên Giáp recalled the opinion expressed by the High Command of the Vietnam People's Army in its letter to the International Commission on August 21st of last year, namely that the South Vietnamese authorities must inherit the obligations undertaken by the French government and continue to implement the Geneva Accords; the Central Joint Commission should continue its normal activities on the basis of the Geneva Agreements. General Võ Nguyên Giáp said in his letter of January 23rd that this opinion of the High Command of the Vietnam People's Army is fully in line with the Geneva Agreements and the proposal made by the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on May 8th, 1956. Unfortunately, however, the French government and the South Vietnamese authorities continue to adhere to their views, which are incompatible with the Geneva Accords and the recommendations of the two chairmen.

In his letter, Võ Nguyên Giáp proposed that the Vietnamese and French delegations to the Central Joint Commission could make contact on a date chosen by the other party to discuss the resumption of activities.

Finally, Võ Nguyên Giáp requested the International Commission to convey this opinion of the High Command of the Vietnam People's Army to the French Ambassador to South Vietnam, Mr. Payart.

(Editor's note) The Central Joint Commission is the abbreviation for the Central Joint Ceasefire Commission in Vietnam. It was established on July 28, 1954, and was composed of representatives of the High Command of the Vietnam People's Army and the High Command of the French Forces in Indochina to implement the ceasefire agreement signed at the Geneva Conference and the terms reached at the local military conference in Vietnam.

On April 26th of last year, the French side, citing the dissolution of the High Command of the French Union Forces, refused to attend meetings of the Central Joint Commission any longer. Regarding this unilateral measure by the French side, the Vietnamese side has repeatedly requested the International Commission for Vietnam to intervene effectively so that the Geneva Accords and other agreements signed by both parties to the agreement can be respected and fully implemented, and so that the joint ceasefire organization responsible for ensuring the implementation of the Geneva Accords can continue its normal activities.

    武元甲写信给越南国际委员会主席
    要求恢复中央联合停战委员会正常活动
    新华社河内27日电　据越南通讯社26日讯：越南人民军总司令武元甲将军1月23日写信给越南国际委员会主席说，越南人民军总司令部驻中央联合委员会代表团和法方代表团有必要进行接触，来讨论恢复中央联合委员会以及有关机构的正常活动问题。这些活动是在法兰西联邦部队在去年4月撤出南越以后停止的。
    武元甲在信中追述了越南人民军总司令部在去年8月21日致国际委员会的信中所表示的意见，即南越当局必须继承法国政府所承担的义务，继续执行日内瓦协定；中央联合委员会应该在日内瓦协议的基础上继续它的正常活动。武元甲将军在他1月23日的信中说，越南人民军总司令部的这个意见完全符合日内瓦协议以及日内瓦会议两位主席在1956年5月8日提出的建议。但是遗憾的是，法国政府和南越当局继续坚持它们的同日内瓦协议和两位主席的建议不相容的意见。
    武元甲在信中提出，越法双方驻中央联合委员会代表团可以在对方选择的一个日期就恢复活动问题进行接触。
    武元甲最后要求国际委员会把越南人民军总司令部的这个意见转告法国驻南越大使巴雅尔。
    （编者注）中央联合委员会是越南中央联合停战委员会的简称。它成立于1954年7月28日，由越南人民军总司令部和印度支那法军总司令部代表组成，以执行在日内瓦会议上签订的停战协定和在越南当地军事会议上达成的条款。
    去年4月26日，法方借口解散法兰西联邦部队总司令部，拒不再出席中央联合委员会的会议。对于法方这种片面的措施，越方曾一再要求越南国际委员会进行有效的干预，以使日内瓦协定和协定双方签订的其他协议得到尊重和充分的履行，并且使负责保证日内瓦协定的履行的联合停战组织能够继续进行正常活动。
