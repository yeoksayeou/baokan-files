Title: Thinking of Convenience for Commune Members

Arriving at many villages, one can see small patches of vegetable gardens near the front and back. I think the placement of these gardens near the villages has at least one advantage—convenience. In the morning, before the rice is cooked, one can use the brief time before going to the fields to plant a few cabbages; in the evening, returning from the fields before dark, one can water the vegetable garden with a few buckets, or spread a few baskets of fertilizer; housewives who are busy with household chores, after finishing cooking and settling the children, often like to spend an hour or two working in the vegetable garden, clearing their minds from the mess of various household affairs; and if a relative or friend suddenly comes and needs a snack, essential seasonings like scallions, garlic, and chili peppers can be obtained from the vegetable garden just across the threshold.

Perhaps, in their life over thousands of years, the peasants have personally experienced this kind of convenience, and have therefore unanimously placed their vegetable gardens in front and back of their houses.

However, after the cooperativization, in some areas, this convenience has gradually been overlooked. Some agricultural cooperatives have set up public vegetable gardens, replacing the small plots cultivated by the commune members themselves, or have assigned remote and poor land to commune members as vegetable gardens, so that commune members can no longer enjoy the convenience they had before. A good example is the Aoshang Team of the Guangxing Agricultural Cooperative in Wannian County, Jiangxi Province. This team is a village of more than sixty households. Before cooperativization, most of the farmers' vegetable gardens were located in front of the village. After cooperativization, all the vegetable gardens in front of the village were used by the advanced cooperative to grow double-cropping rice. If commune members wanted to eat vegetables, they had to go to the foot of the mountain, about a mile away from the village, to plant them. Some cadres told them when members voiced their opinions: "This is for the benefit of the cooperative!" Since it was for the benefit of the cooperative, the commune members were not in a position to object.

However, some careful commune members did not agree that this would bring benefits to the cooperative. They calculated the following account: Last year, the cooperative planted double-cropping rice on the six mu of vegetable garden land in front of the village that should have been reserved for commune members. Compared with the fields at the foot of the mountain where only one crop of rice can be grown a year, they harvested more than three thousand catties of grain. However, because the soil at the foot of the mountain was too poor, the commune members harvested about 180 yuan less worth of vegetables, equivalent to more than 3,600 catties of grain, even though they spent the same amount of labor and resources as they would have when planting the gardens near the village. Therefore, the result of exchanging the good and nearby vegetable gardens for the poor and remote ones was that, nominally, the cooperative harvested 3,000 more catties of grain, but in reality, the income of the commune members was reduced by more than 600 catties of grain.

The problem is not just that 600 catties of grain were reduced, but also that this brought a lot of trouble to the commune members, and many people did not have enough vegetables to eat as a result. With the vegetable gardens far away, the commune members could no longer use the time in the morning and evening to cultivate vegetables as they used to. As a result, the vegetable gardens did not receive timely watering, fertilization, and pest control, and the vegetables either dried up or were eaten by insects. Ni Qizong, a commune member, only harvested a few catties of chili peppers from the hundred or so chili plants he planted last March. Some families who did not harvest any cabbage had to eat pickles every day. Ni Yingsong, another commune member, used to plant some sugar cane in his vegetable garden every year and boil more than ten catties of sugar to celebrate the New Year; last year, because the soil in the allocated vegetable garden was too poor, the sugar cane, which should have grown to more than ten feet tall, was only two feet tall, and it was impossible to boil sugar at all, so he had to prepare to buy sugar for the New Year.

Think more of the convenience of commune members!

    为社员的方便着想
    绿野
    走到许多村庄，都能在村前村后看见一小块一小块的菜地。菜园设在村庄的前后，我想至少是因为有这么一个好处——方便。早上，饭还没熟，上田以前的片刻时间，可以利用来栽几棵白菜；晚上，从田里回来，天还没有黑尽，还可以在菜地上浇几桶水，泼几篓粪；家务事较忙的妇女，收拾好了锅灶，安置好了孩子，往往喜欢利用一两个钟头来从事菜园劳动，理清被五花八门的家务事弄乱了的心情；要是突然来个亲戚朋友，需要招待吃碗点心，葱、大蒜、辣椒，这些不可缺少的调料，只要跨过门槛就可以在菜园里得到。
    或许，在几千年来的生活中，农民们就是亲身体验到了这种方便，才不约而同地把菜园设在自己的屋前屋后。
    可是，在合作化以后，在一些地区，这种方便渐渐被人忽视了。有的农业社设公共菜地，代替了社员自种的小块菜地，或者把远地坏地分给社员作菜地，社员再享受不到以前那种方便了。江西省万年县光星农业社的坳上队就是个例子。这个队是一个六十多户人家的村子，在没有合作化以前，大部分农民的菜地都是设在村庄面前。合作化以后，村前的菜地全被高级社用来栽种了双季稻。社员要吃蔬菜，只有跑到离村一里来路的山脚下去栽种。社员有意见，一些干部对他们说：“这是为了社的利益！”既然是为了社的利益，社员也就不便反对了。
    不过，一些细心的社员是不承认这样做会给社里带来利益的。他们算了这样一笔账：社里去年把村庄面前应该留给社员的六亩来菜地栽上了双季稻，比起山脚下只能种一季禾的田来，是多收了三千来斤谷子。可是，社员在山脚下种蔬菜，因为土质太差，虽然和种村前菜地一样花了工本，但少收了约一百八十多元的蔬菜，折成谷子就是三千六百多斤。算来，把近的好的菜地换成远地坏地的结果，名义上社里多收了三千斤谷子，其实，从社员的收入来说，却是减少了六百多斤谷子。
    问题还不仅仅在于减少了六百多斤谷子，还在于这样做给社员带来了很多麻烦，很多人因此没有足够的蔬菜吃。菜地离远了，社员再不能像往常那样利用早上、傍晚的时间来培育蔬菜了，于是菜地得不到及时的浇水、下肥、除虫，蔬菜干死的干死，虫吃的虫吃。社员倪启宗去年3月栽的一百多棵辣椒，只收上几斤辣椒。一些没有收到白菜的人家，就天天吃咸菜。社员倪英松年年要在菜地上栽些甘蔗，熬十多斤糖过年；去年因为分的菜地土质太坏，应该长到一丈多高的甘蔗，只有二尺多高，根本没法熬糖，只好准备买糖过年。
    多为社员的方便着想着想吧！
