    "Relapse"
    By Our Correspondent in London Pan Fei
    At six o'clock in the afternoon on January 9th, Eden appeared at the door of Number 10 Downing Street. A series of meetings had just concluded here. A gloomy complexion, slow steps—it was only when the photographers pointed their lenses at him that Eden managed to force a wry smile. A car took him to Buckingham Palace to see the Queen. Forty minutes later, Buckingham Palace officially announced that Eden's resignation had been approved.
    Eden's reason for resigning was exactly the same as the statement he issued when he crossed the Atlantic last time and fled to Jamaica. The letter of resignation, published in British newspapers, stated: "When I returned a month ago, I hoped that my health would recover more and that I could work effectively. But this hope has not been realized." This reason is, of course, not taken seriously. Because when Eden had just returned from Jamaica, he told reporters at London Airport: "As you know, I went abroad to restore my health. I am now fully recovered and fit to resume my duties."
    In fact, since the British and French were forced to cease fire, the British newspapers had already left many "foreshadowings" for Eden's departure between the lines. The most recent instance was in the "Times" New Year's editorial. After outlining the current difficulties and future tasks, it wrote earnestly: The nation "must have confidence in its government, and the government must have confidence in its head." Can those in high positions find the necessary confidence to provide the firm leadership that is more indispensable than ever now? This is the question that must be answered first in the first few months of the new year.
    The reason why Eden's resignation was delayed for two months or so is said to be due to three reasons: First, there was no successor. The British ruling group had not yet found anyone to replace Eden. Second, to save face—of course, not just Eden's face, but first and foremost Britain's face. Delaying it would allow time to dilute people's memories and forget the disgraceful encounters Britain suffered in the Middle East. Third, it might be a good idea to let Eden remain in office for a period to see what happens.
    However, during these days, Britain's economic situation continued to deteriorate; the British people's dissatisfaction with the government continued to grow (7.3 million people had already requested pay increases); there was much talk of "Atlantic unity," but relations between Britain and the United States "improved" very little. Another serious problem for the Conservative Party was the middle class's dissatisfaction with it due to oil rationing and inflation; and without the support of this class, it would be difficult for it to obtain enough votes as the ruling party. Unfortunately, in the by-elections held in Milton and Mobberley in December, the Conservative Party received more than one-third fewer votes than it had the previous year. This made Eden's continued rule more harmful than beneficial to the Conservative Party. Thus, Eden "relapsed." Under Eden's "medical record" lies a very simple fact: the British Conservative Party decided to use Eden's resignation to improve its situation, restore its reputation, and avoid holding a general election. It is estimated that if a general election were held this spring, the Conservative Party would lose two hundred seats in the House of Commons. It can be seen that Eden is a victim of the Conservative Party's policies. However, when it appeared in the newspapers, he was depicted as a "hero" who knew the times. The "Times" wrote: "There is nothing else to say about the action he (referring to Eden) has taken but unanimous praise. This requires courage, strength, and selflessness. These qualities are not common in our history, let alone in a prime minister."
    How will the British political situation develop? The "Workers' Daily" published a statement by the British Communist Party calling for a general election to change the government and policies. The statement began by writing: "Eden has stepped down—now, the entire Conservative government must also step down!" The statement concluded: We call on Communists and Labour to take action to drive the Conservatives out of power. The next few days are decisive days, do not miss the opportunity!

    “旧病复发”
    本报驻伦敦记者　潘非
    1月9日下午六点，艾登出现在唐宁街十号门口。一连串的会议，刚刚在这里结束。阴沉的脸色，缓慢的步伐——只是当摄影记者把镜头对准他时，艾登才勉强挤出一丝苦笑。一辆轿车，把他送到白金汉宫，去觐见女王。四十分钟以后，白金汉宫正式宣布：艾登的辞职已经获准了。
    艾登辞职的理由同上次横渡大西洋，败走牙买加时所发表的声明，完全一样。公布在英国报纸上的辞职书写道：“当我一个月前回来的时候，希望我的健康更多恢复，有效地进行工作。但这个希望现在没有实现。”这理由当然并不为人重视。因为当艾登刚从牙买加回来的时候，他在伦敦机场上向记者们说：“如你们所知道的，我到国外去是为了恢复健康。我现在已经完全恢复健康了，足以重新担负我的职务”。
    其实，自从英法被迫停火以来，英国报纸的字里行间，早已为艾登的去职留下过许多“伏笔”。最近的一次见诸于“泰晤士报”的元旦社论。它在概述了目前的困难和今后的任务以后，语重心长地写道：全国“必须对它的政府有信心，而政府必须对它的首脑有信心”。身踞高位的这些人能否找到必要的信心，从而给予再没有比现在更为不可少的坚定领导呢？这是新年的头几个月必须首先给以答复的问题。
    艾登的辞职所以拖了两个来月的光景，此中原委，据悉有三：一是后继无人，英国统治集团还没有物色到由谁来代替艾登。二是保留面子——当然不只是艾登的面子，首先是英国的面子。拖一拖，可以让时间去冲淡人们的记忆，忘掉英国在中东所受到的不光彩的遭遇。三是不妨让艾登留任一个时期，以观后效。
    但是，在这些日子里，英国的经济情况在继续恶化；英国人民对政府的不满在继续增长（已经有七百三十万人提出了增资要求）；“大西洋的团结”谈得很多，英美两国的关系却“改善”很少。对保守党来说，另一个严重的问题是中产阶级由于石油配给和通货膨胀所引起的对它的不满；而失去了这一阶层的支持，它就难以获得作为执政党的足够的选票。不妙的是，12月份在密尔敦、莫勃莱举行的补缺选举中，保守党比前年少得了三分之一以上的选票。这样，就使得艾登的继续执政，对保守党说来已害多利少。于是，艾登“旧病复发”。在艾登的“病历表”下面，掩盖着一个最简单不过的事实：英国保守党决定以艾登的下台，来改善它的处境，挽回它的名誉，并避免举行大选。而有人估计，大选如果在今春举行，保守党在下院的席位就会丧失二百个。可见，艾登是保守党政策的牺牲品。不过，在见诸报端时，他已被描绘成识时务的“俊杰”。“泰晤士报”写道：“对于他（指艾登）所采取的行动，没有别的可说，只能一致赞扬。这需要勇气、力量以及大公无私。这些品质，在我们的历史上并不是常见的，更不用说身为首相了。”
    英国的政治局势将怎样发展呢？“工人日报”刊登了英国共产党的声明，号召举行大选，改变政府和政策。这篇声明的开端是这样写的：“艾登下台了——现在，整个保守党政府也必须下台！”声明的结束语是：我们要求共产党人和劳工采取行动，把保守党人赶下台。今后的几天是决定性的日子，不要坐失时机！　（1月10日电）
