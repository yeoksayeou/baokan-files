Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Enterprises under the First Ministry of Machine Building are extensively carrying out work to conserve steel and other metal materials. This is a major measure taken by the First Ministry of Machine Building to ensure the completion of this year's production plan in the context of tight steel supply.

Currently, many enterprises under the First Ministry of Machine Building have found huge potential for saving metal materials by starting with the analysis of product design and process methods. According to the conservation plans put forward by thirty enterprises, the material consumption quota for most products is expected to be reduced by about 7% to 10% this year, and some products can be reduced even more. Among them, the 30-horsepower diesel engine produced by the Wuxi Diesel Engine Factory, after modifying the design and improving the process methods, can save about 20% of materials per unit. According to the planned output of this type of diesel engine this year, the materials saved throughout the year can produce more than 250 additional diesel engines of the same horsepower. The design of eight major products of the Dalian Mining and Industrial Vehicle Factory has been carefully reviewed, and it has been found that the weight of each product can be reduced. Just by making certain parts of the 60-ton tipper truck thinner, changing from riveting to welding, and taking some other measures, more than one ton of steel can be saved per unit. The Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Factory plans to appropriately thin the bed, worktable, and other three components of a gantry planer it produces, which can save 1.7 tons of steel materials per unit, accounting for about 8% of the planer's weight.

In the work of saving metal materials, many enterprises have paid attention to mobilizing the masses of workers to propose specific conservation measures, establishing material conservation on a fully reliable basis. For example, in the process of modifying the design and technology of the 60-horsepower diesel engine, the technicians of the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory analyzed the parts of the diesel engine one by one, and repeatedly discussed and compared them. Finally, they decided to improve the design and process methods of 120 parts, which can save more than 430 kilograms of materials per unit. In the process of studying and improving the process method of a hexagonal turret lathe, the process personnel of the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory proposed various measures such as implementing nesting, material nesting, and reducing machining allowance. After the implementation of these measures, it is estimated that the steel saved throughout the year can produce more than 160 additional hexagonal turret lathes of the same type. The Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory mobilized engineering and technical personnel and production management personnel to check the conservation potential in design, technology, production management, and other aspects, and put forward a total of more than 90 measures to save metal materials. After the design structure of the 50-ton standard crane was improved, it is estimated that more than 4 tons of metal materials can be saved per unit.

In order to strengthen the leadership of enterprises in saving metal materials, the First Ministry of Machine Building recently established a Ministry's Metal Conservation Working Group jointly by the Technology Department and the Supply Bureau, which is specifically responsible for the conservation of metal materials in all its affiliated enterprises. Most of the enterprises under this ministry have also established metal conservation organizations with the participation of deputy factory directors in charge of production technology, or chief engineers and responsible persons from design, technology, and supply departments, to specifically lead the metal material conservation work of their respective enterprises. The First Ministry of Machine Building also plans to convene metal material conservation meetings by region to study and solve problems in the conservation work and widely exchange experiences in this regard.

    克服原料不足的困难，保证完成生产计划
    第一机械工业部大力节约金属
    新华社19日讯　第一机械工业部所属企业正在广泛地开展节约钢材和其他金属材料的工作。这是第一机械工业部在钢材供应紧张的情况下，为保证完成今年生产计划所采取的一项重大措施。
    目前第一机械工业部所属不少企业从分析产品设计和工艺方法着手，找到了节约金属材料的巨大潜力。从三十个企业提出的节约计划看来，大部分产品的材料消耗定额预计今年可以降低7％到10％左右，有些产品可以降低更多。其中，无锡柴油机厂生产的三十马力柴油机，经过修改设计和改进工艺方法，每台可以节约用料20％左右，按照这种柴油机今年计划产量计算，全年节省下的用料可以生产同样马力柴油机两百五十多台。大连工矿车辆厂的八种主要产品的设计经过认真审核，发现每种产品的重量都可以减轻，只是六十吨翻车的某些零件由厚改薄、由铆接改为焊接，以及采取其他一些措施，每台就可以节约钢材一吨多。济南第二机床厂生产的一种龙门刨床，计划把床身、工作台等三个部件适当改薄，每台就可以节约钢铁材料一点七吨，占刨床重量的8％左右。
    不少企业在节约金属材料的工作中，都注意发动职工群众提出具体的节约措施，把节约材料建立在充分可靠的基础上。例如上海柴油机厂技术人员在修改六十马力柴油机的设计和工艺过程中，对柴油机的零件逐个作了分析，并且反复地讨论、比较，最后确定改进其中的一百二十个零件的设计和工艺方法，每台可以节约用料四百三十多公斤。沈阳第三机床厂工艺人员在研究改进一种六角车床的工艺方法的过程中，提出了实行套裁、套料、减少加工余量等多种措施，实行这些措施以后，预计全年节约下来的钢材可以生产同类型的六角车床一百六十多台。太原重型机器厂发动工程技术人员和生产管理人员，检查设计、工艺、生产管理等方面的节约潜力，一共提出九十多项节约金属材料的措施，其中五十吨标式起重机改进设计结构以后，预计每台可以少用金属材料四吨多。
    为了加强对企业节约金属材料工作的领导，第一机械工业部不久前由技术司、供应局联合成立了部的金属节约工作组，专门负责全部所属企业金属材料的节约工作；这个部所属的大部分企业，目前也都成立了有生产技术副厂长、或总工程师和设计、工艺、供应部门等负责人员参加的金属节约组织，专门领导本企业的金属材料节约工作。第一机械工业部还准备按地区分别召开金属材料节约会议，研究解决节约工作中的问题，广泛交流这方面的经验。
