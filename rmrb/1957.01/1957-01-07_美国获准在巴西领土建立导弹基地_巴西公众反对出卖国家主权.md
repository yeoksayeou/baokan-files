    US Granted Permission to Build Missile Base on Brazilian Territory
    Brazilian Public Opposes Selling Out National Sovereignty
    (Comprehensive report from this newspaper) Montevideo dispatch: The Brazilian government recently agreed to allow the United States to establish a military base on the island of Fernando de Noronha in Brazil, which has aroused strong protests from all sectors of Brazilian society.
    On December 26 last year, the Brazilian government and the United States reached an agreement on the establishment of a missile observation station by the United States on the island of Fernando de Noronha in Brazilian territory. According to reports, Brazil has agreed to grant the United States the right to build a missile observation station on this island for a period of ten years, while the United States "guarantees" Brazil's "sovereignty claims" over the island. In addition, the United States also promised to increase military "aid" to Brazil and improve the technical level of such "aid."
    Since the plan for the United States to establish a missile observation station on the island of Fernando de Noronha was revealed, it has been fiercely opposed by patriotic forces in Brazil, and Brazilian military personnel have also opposed the government's plan to abandon sovereignty. This opposition once interrupted the negotiations between the United States and Brazil on this issue. Recently, the Brazilian Movement for the Defense of Peace wrote to Brazilian President Kubitschek, condemning the agreement to allow the United States to establish a military base on the island of Fernando de Noronha. Leaders of many trade unions in Brazil and representatives of various student organizations also opposed handing over Brazilian territory to the United States to establish a military base. A group of deputies of the Brazilian National Assembly said that the issue of handing over the island of Fernando de Noronha to the United States cannot be decided without the consent of the National Assembly.
    Citizens of Rio de Janeiro originally planned to hold a mass demonstration on January 2 to protest against handing over the island of Fernando de Noronha to the United States. However, their patriotic actions were banned by government authorities.

    美国获准在巴西领土建立导弹基地
    巴西公众反对出卖国家主权
    本报综合报道　蒙得维的亚消息：巴西政府最近答应美国在巴西的斐南多诺隆耶岛建立军事基地，引起了巴西各阶层的强烈抗议。
    巴西政府和美国在去年12月26日就美国在巴西领土斐南多诺隆耶岛上建立导弹视察站的问题达成协议。据消息报道，巴西已经同意给予美国在这个岛上建立导弹视察站的为期十年的权利，同时美国“保证”巴西对这个岛的“主权要求”。此外，美国还答应增加给巴西的军事“援助”和提高这种“援助”的技术水平。
    自从美国要在斐南多诺隆耶岛建立导弹视察站的计划透露出来以后，就一直遭到巴西爱国力量的猛烈反对，巴西的军界人士也反对政府放弃主权的打算。这种反对曾经使得美国和巴西关于这个问题的谈判一度中断。最近，巴西保卫和平运动写信给巴西总统库比契克，谴责让美国在斐南多诺隆耶岛建立军事基地的协定。巴西许多工会的领导人和各学生组织的代表也反对把巴西领土交给美国建立军事基地。巴西国民大会的一批议员说，把斐南多诺隆耶岛交给美国的问题没有得到国民大会的同意是不能作出决定的。
    里约热内卢的市民原打算在1月2日举行群众示威游行，反对把斐南多诺隆耶岛交给美国。但是他们的爱国行动遭到政府当局的禁止。
