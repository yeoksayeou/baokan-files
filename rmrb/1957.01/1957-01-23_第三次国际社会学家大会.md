    Third International Congress of Sociologists
    Fei Duoxieyefu, Director of the Institute of Philosophy, Academy of Sciences of the USSR
    Editor's Note: Our reporter interviewed Comrade Fei Duoxieyefu, Director of the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, who returned from the Third International Congress of Sociologists, and asked him to share his thoughts and comments on the conference. The following is Comrade Fei Duoxieyefu's response to our reporter.
    The Third International Congress of Sociologists was held in Amsterdam at the end of August last year. More than 500 delegates from 57 countries attended the congress. Scholars from the Soviet Union and European People's Democratic countries participated in the congress. Fewer sociologists from Eastern countries attended. There was almost no participation from Marxists in Western European countries.
    The theme of the congress was "Social Change in the Twentieth Century." On this issue, the congress showed two basic viewpoints: the Marxist viewpoint and the non-Marxist viewpoint (or what was often called the Western viewpoint at the congress).
    In the reports and speeches of the Marxists, the great significance of the law-governed establishment of the world socialist economic system and the disintegration of the imperialist colonial system was pointed out, the increasing role of the masses of people in modern history was emphasized, and the sharpening of contradictions in capitalist society due to the improvement of productivity was explained. It should be admitted that the transition from a social way of life based on private ownership, which has been formed for a long time, to a new social system based on socialist public ownership is the fundamental and most general law of modern social development.
    The fundamental social changes and outstanding scientific and technological achievements of this century are not coincidences in time; there is an internal inevitable connection between them, because the development of material production is their common foundation. The emergence of aviation, radio technology, and remote control technology, especially the discovery of atomic energy, would not be possible without modern powerful industry. Moreover, increased productivity is the material foundation for profound social changes. The basic direction of these changes is determined by the fact that production has reached a high degree of concentration and socialization that contradicts the capitalist ownership of the means of production.
    Many countries have completed or are in the process of transitioning to a socialist economic system. This is not an accidental phenomenon, but a manifestation of the basic laws of social change in the twentieth century. Changes in all fields of political system, national relations, family relations, education, and interpersonal relationships are, in the final analysis, the result of these fundamental changes in the economic foundation of society.
    How do "Western" sociologists understand social change in the twentieth century?
    The greatest characteristic of most Western sociologists is that they try their best to avoid or belittle the fundamental changes of the twentieth century and the powerful national liberation movements of our time, and only describe individual phenomena, facts, and partial reforms in legislation, education, labor organization, family relations, etc. Bourgeois sociologists naturally try to exaggerate some changes that have taken place in capitalist economy and production organization in recent decades, and describe them as the most fundamental social changes of the twentieth century.
    It can be said that the basic point of all kinds of speeches made by Western sociologists at the conference clearly showed the intention to cover up the increasingly sharp class contradictions in capitalist society. They put forward two basic concepts for this purpose: the first concept is social strata, and the second concept is social mobility.
    Bourgeois sociologists, especially American sociologists, have long asserted that the concept of class is outdated, and the new "scientific" concept that adapts to the modern situation should be the concept of "stratum," that is, social stratum. Therefore, class distinction in society should not be mentioned, but social strata should be mentioned; it should be said that people are divided according to different social groups. At the same time, it is also believed that these groups are not related to a certain relationship to the means of production. They are distinguished by people's position, occupation and education, sources and amount of income, and so on.
    As for social change, bourgeois sociologists especially emphasize that at the same time as residents move from some regions, enterprises, and institutions to others, individuals also rise from the lower stratum to the upper stratum, and move from some social groups to other social groups. Therefore, the main topics of the reports of the ownership group, the education group, and the ethics group at this conference were "Social Changes in Western Society," and the content was that class barriers have been removed, and workers have the opportunity to rise to the upper stratum, receive higher education, buy stocks, participate in the distribution of profits, participate in business management, and so on. They call the so-called Western society an "open society," where everyone can become what they want to be.
    According to some Western sociologists, especially American sociologists, the exploitation of workers by capital has disappeared, and if it is still preserved in some places, then this is an accidental and remaining phenomenon. Class opposition seems to have eased, and the two poles of the class, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, have changed their appearance. These sociologists insist that workers have property and have become part of the middle class, while capitalists are no longer the owners of enterprises, they have become employees of industrial enterprises and financial institutions. The middle class seems to have become the main and essentially the only class. Many Western sociologists, such as Jesse Bernard and William Foote Whyte, believe that capitalist private ownership has become a thing of the past. According to them, shareholder ownership is already public ownership.
    It should be pointed out that at the conference, and in bourgeois sociology in recent times, the most popular class theory is the distribution theory, which links the existence of class to the distribution of income and the inequality of income amount. The distribution theory enables bourgeois sociologists to ignore people's relationship to the means of production, that is, the ownership relationship, and deceive people with various calculations about income distribution.
    Old organizational and technical viewpoints on the class essence, class change, and class evolution are intertwined with this distribution theory. The essence of this viewpoint is that class is now not related to ownership, but to management, to administrative organizational functions or executive functions. The basic point of this theory is also to try to deviate from the basic characteristics of class division, that is, to deviate from their relationship to the means of production.
    However, let us take a look at the basis and materials cited to demonstrate social change, to demonstrate the disappearance of class barriers and the opposition of bourgeois society. Upon careful examination, these materials are actually against the supporters of the above viewpoints themselves. In the report of American sociologist Carter Meyer, it was revealed that in the United States, wage earners accounted for 52.8% of the total labor force in 1870, 56.8% in 1910, 56.5% in 1950, and 55.6% in 1954. It can be seen that the working class has not disappeared in more than eighty years, but has increased somewhat. This class creates surplus value, but the surplus value is occupied by various groups of the bourgeoisie.
    Regarding the middle class, verifiable materials were also cited in the report. The so-called independent business owners, together with the labor force members of the family, accounted for 40.4% of the total labor force in 1870, 27.1% in 1910, 14.4% in 1950, and 13.3% in 1954. It can be seen from this that most of the small producers who constitute the basis of the "middle class" have gone bankrupt and now live by being employed by others. The middle class is mostly supplemented by employees, and their proportion in the labor force has increased from 6.6% in 1870 to 30.8% in 1954. The so-called increase in the number of the middle class is the increase in the non-productive population. The situation is that labor productivity has increased a lot, but the ever-increasing surplus product created by the production workers is increasingly used by monopoly capitalists for their own parasitic consumption and supporting a group of people who serve them.
    As for those claims that private ownership has disappeared due to the increase in joint-stock companies, they are as unfounded as the argument of class equality. Everyone knows that the controlling amount of stocks is controlled by a few millionaires and billionaires. Capitalist ownership has only changed its shape. Now, capitalists do not individually, but jointly control the most basic means of production, jointly exploit wage workers, and then distribute profits according to capital. The argument that workers can also have stocks is not worth paying attention to, because no more than 3% of working families in the United States have stocks, and the amount is small. Like the well-known saying that workers participate in the management of capitalist enterprises, this is also to cover up capitalist production relations.
    The International Congress of Sociologists reflected the profound changes in social consciousness in a unique way. With very few exceptions, Western sociologists did not dare to openly defend capitalism, private ownership of the means of production, and the necessity of the bourgeoisie. This may be the biggest feature of the conference. Only some sociologists, such as the famous French anti-communist Aron or a few unknown but fanatical defenders of bourgeois society such as the American sociologist Anderson, openly defended capitalism and refuted socialism with the capitalist system.
    As for the majority of Western participants in the conference, they took into account that the capitalist economic system and the system of capital exploitation of labor are unpopular, and the attraction of socialism is growing. Therefore, they are all committed to whitewashing capitalism and portraying it as a new society. Not all of them call this "new" society socialism, but in essence they all attribute some qualities inherent in socialism to it. The words "capitalist" and "banker" have become shameful or at least indecent words. Therefore, many Western sociologists, including some American sociologists, are trying to prove that there are no bankers, no coal tycoons and steel tycoons, in short, no billionaires, and no capitalists in the United States now.
    Even the basis on which bourgeois sociologists criticize socialism is that the basic characteristics of capitalism are extremely unpopular among the broad strata of residents. Bourgeois sociologists are now trying to impose these characteristics (in the struggle against which socialist society has arisen) on socialism in order to undermine the prestige of socialism and reduce its attractiveness. According to bourgeois sociologists, under the socialist system, the class differentiation of society is constantly intensifying, and a new ruling class is emerging—the intellectuals. In other words, bourgeois sociologists want to transfer the unpopular characteristics of bourgeois society—exploitation and class antagonism—to socialism.
    When there were very few intellectuals in the Soviet Union, those who criticized socialism said that socialist construction would fail due to insufficient cultural forces. Now that millions of intellectuals have been trained from among workers and peasants, these critics are making people doubt the popular nature of socialist intellectuals.
    The issue of peaceful coexistence attracted great attention from the participants of the conference. At the request of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), a meeting with the participation of representatives from many countries was held during the conference to discuss the participation of sociologists in the discussion of the issue of peaceful coexistence. Two topics were proposed for research and discussion: "The theoretical and historical development of the concept of peaceful coexistence" and "Economic relations and cultural relations between countries with different social systems." These meetings agreed that the various scientific associations affiliated to UNESCO will actively participate in the discussion of these issues, convene seminars, and hold meetings on some issues of peaceful coexistence with the participation of representatives of various social sciences. Not only should works be published in each country, but UNESCO may also compile and publish the works of scholars from various countries expounding different aspects of the general topic. This concern of sociologists for the issue of peaceful coexistence also reflects the influence of current social opinion, which is entirely conducive to effectively defending peace.

    第三次国际社会学家大会
    苏联科学院哲学研究所所长　　费多谢也夫
    编者按：本报记者访问了参加第三次国际社会学家大会归来的苏联科学院哲学研究所所长费多谢也夫同志，请他就这一次的大会发表感想和评论。下文就是费多谢也夫同志对本报记者的答复。
    去年8月底在阿姆斯特丹举行了第三次国际社会学家大会。出席大会的有来自五十七个国家的五百多个代表。苏联和欧洲人民民主国家的学者参加了大会。东方国家的社会学家出席的比较少。几乎完全没有西欧国家的马克思主义者参加。
    大会讨论的题目是“二十世纪的社会变化”。在这个问题上，大会表现出两种基本观点：马克思主义观点和非马克思主义观点（或者像大会上所常说的西方观点）。
    在马克思主义者们的报告和讲话中，指明了世界社会主义经济体系合乎规律的建立和帝国主义殖民体系的瓦解的重大意义，着重指出了人民群众在现代历史中日益增强的作用，说明了资本主义社会的矛盾由于生产力提高而尖锐化。应当承认，从很长时期形成的、以私有制为基础的社会生活方式过渡到以社会主义公有制为依据的新社会制度，这是现代社会发展的根本的、最一般的规律。
    本世纪的根本的社会变化和卓越的科学技术成就不是时间上的巧合，它们之间有着内部的必然的联系，因为物质生产的发展是它们的共同基础。航空、无线电技术和遥控技术的出现，尤其是原子能的发现，没有现代的强大工业是不可能的。并且，增长了的生产力乃是深刻的社会变革的物质基础。这些变革的基本方向决定于生产达到了同生产资料的资本主义所有制相抵触的高度的集中和社会化。
    许多国家已经完成或正在进行向社会主义经济制度的过渡。这不是什么偶然现象，而是二十世纪社会变化的基本规律的表现。在政治制度、民族关系、家庭关系、教育以及人们之间的相互关系的一切领域中的变化，归根结底，都是社会的经济基础的这些根本改变的结果。
    “西方”社会学家如何理解二十世纪的社会变化呢？
    大多数西方社会学家的最大特点是极力回避或贬抑二十世纪的根本变革和我们时代的强大的民族解放运动，只限于描述在立法、教育、劳动组织、家庭关系等等中的个别现象、事实、部分改革。资产阶级社会学家自然企图渲染近几十年来在资本主义经济和生产组织中发生的一些变化，并把它们说成是二十世纪的最根本的社会变革。
    可以说，在西方社会学家在大会上的所有各种各样的讲话的基本论点中，明显地表现出掩饰资本主义社会日益尖锐的阶级矛盾的意图。他们为此提出了两个基本概念：第一个概念是社会层，第二个概念是社会变动。
    资产阶级社会学家特别是美国社会学家，早就断言，阶级这个概念已经过时了，适应现代情况的新的“科学的”概念应该是“层”即社会阶层这个概念。所以不应当提社会的阶级区分，而应当提社会层，应当说按不同的社会集团来划分人。同时还认为，这些集团和对生产资料的一定关系是没有关联的。它们是依人们的职位高低，依职业和教育，依收入的来源和数额等等而有区别的。
    至于说到社会变动，资产阶级社会学家特别强调的是，同居民从一些地区、企业和机关移转到另一些地区、企业和机关的同时，个人也从下层升入上层，从一些社会集团转入另一些社会集团。所以，这次大会中所有制问题组、教育问题组、道德问题组的报告的主要题目都是“西方社会的社会变动”，内容都是说什么阶级屏障已经撤除，工人有可能升入上层、受到高等教育、购买股票、参与利润的分配、参加企业管理等等。他们把所谓的西方社会叫做“开放的社会”，在那里每个人想成为什么样的人就能成为什么样的人。
    根据某些西方社会学家特别是美国社会学家的说法，资本对工人的剥削已经消失了，如果有些地方还保存下来，那末这是偶然的、残存的现象。阶级对立好像缓和了，阶级的两极即无产阶级和资产阶级已经改变样子了。这些社会学家硬说工人有了财产，并且成了中产阶级的一部分，而资本家已不再是企业的所有者了，他们变成了工业企业和金融机关的职员。中产阶级似乎成了主要的、实质上是唯一的阶级。许多西方社会学家，例如杰西·贝尔纳、威廉·福里特曼认为，资本主义私有制已成为过去了。据他们看来，股东所有制已经是公有制。
    应当指出，在大会上，以及最近时期在资产阶级社会学中，最流行的阶级理论是把阶级的存在同收入的分配，同收入数额的不均联系起来的分配论。分配论使资产阶级社会学家能够忽视人们对生产资料的关系即所有制关系，以有关收入分配的种种计算来骗人。
    对阶级本质、阶级变化和阶级进化的旧的组织技术观点同这种分配论交错在一起。这个观点的实质就在于阶级现在不是同所有制有关联，而是同管理、同行政组织职能或执行职能有关联。这个理论的基本论点也是力图离开划分阶级的基本标志，即离开它们同生产资料的关系。
    不过我们要看一看援引来论证社会变动、论证阶级屏障和资产阶级社会的对立已消逝的根据和材料。仔细考察时，发现这些材料反而反对上述论点的拥护者们自己。在美国社会学家卡尔特·麦耶的报告中披露，在美国，雇佣工人在全部有劳动能力的人口中，1870年占52.8％，1910年占56.8％，1950年占56.5％，1954年占55.6％。可见八十多年来雇用工人阶级并没有消失，而是有些增加。这个阶级创造着剩余价值，但剩余价值却被资产阶级的各种集团占有。
    关于中产阶级，在报告中也引证了可资证明的材料。所谓的独立企业主连同家庭的有劳动能力的成员在全体有劳动能力的人口中，1870年占40.4％，1910年占27.1％，1950年占14.4％，1954年占13.3％。由此可见，构成“中产阶级”的基础的小生产者，大多数破产了，现在依靠受雇于人过活。中产阶级大部分是由职员补充的，他们在有劳动能力的人口中的比重，从1870年的6.6％增加到1954年的30.8％。所谓中产阶级人数增加就是不事生产的人口增加。情况是这样，劳动生产率提高了很多，可是为生产工人所创造的不断增加的剩余产品，越来越为垄断资本家用于自身的寄生性消费和赡养为其服务的一群人。
    至于那些说私有制由于股分公司增加而消逝的断言，它们像阶级平等的论点一样是毫无根据的。谁都知道，股票的控制额为几小撮百万富翁和亿万富翁所掌握。资本主义所有制只是改变了形状，现在资本家不是个个分别地，而是由一伙人共同掌握最基本的生产资料，共同剥削雇佣工人，然后按照资本来分配利润。关于工人也能有股票的论调是不值得认真注意的，因为在美国有股票的工人家庭不超过3％，而且数额不大。和人所尽知的工人参加资本主义企业管理的说法一样，这也是遮掩资本主义生产关系。
    国际社会学家大会以独特的形式反映出社会意识的深刻变化。除了极少数的例外，西方社会学家没有敢公开地为资本主义、生产资料私有制、资产阶级的必要性辩护，这或许就是大会上的最大特点。只有像著名的法国反共产主义者阿龙或少数不著名的然而却是狂热的资产阶级社会的辩护者的美国社会学家安德逊这样一些社会学家，才公开地为资本主义辩护，用资本主义制度来驳斥社会主义。
    至于大会的大多数西方参加者，他们考虑到，资本主义的经济体系、资本剥削劳动的制度已不得人心，而社会主义的吸引力日益增长。所以他们都致力于粉饰资本主义，把它描绘成一种新社会似的。不是他们所有的人都把这个“新”社会叫做社会主义，但是实质上他们都把社会主义所固有的某些性质归之于它。“资本家”、“银行家”这些词成了可耻的或者至少是不体面的词。所以，许多西方社会学家，其中也有某些美国的社会学家，努力证明现在美国既没有银行家，也没有煤炭大王和钢铁大王，总之，没有亿万富翁，没有任何资本家。
    甚至资产阶级社会学家批评社会主义所持的根据也是：在广大的居民阶层中，资本主义的基本特性是极不受欢迎的。资产阶级社会学家现在就是极力把这些特性（在同它们斗争中产生了社会主义社会）妄加在社会主义身上，这样来破坏社会主义的威信，减少它的吸引力。按照资产阶级社会学家的说法，在社会主义制度下，社会的阶级分化不断加剧，正在出现新的当权阶级——知识分子。换言之，资产阶级社会学家想把资产阶级社会的不得人心的特征——剥削和阶级对抗——转嫁给社会主义。
    当苏联的知识分子很少的时候，批评社会主义的人们说，社会主义建设会因文化力量不足而失败的。现在当从工人和农民中间培养出千百万个知识分子的时候，这些批评家们又使人怀疑社会主义知识分子的人民性。
    和平共处问题引起了大会参加者们很大的注意。依照联合国教育、科学及文化组织的请求，在大会期间，就社会学家参加和平共处问题的讨论举行了有许多国家的代表参加的会议。提出了两个供研究和讨论的题目：“和平共处这个概念的理论和历史发展”，“具有不同社会制度的国家之间的经济关系和文化关系”。这些会议议定，联合国教育、科学及文化组织所属各种科学协会将积极参加这些问题的讨论，召开讨论会，以及就和平共处的一些问题举行有各门社会科学的代表参加的会议。不仅要在每个国家发表著作，而且联合国教育、科学及文化组织也可能把各国学者阐述总题目的不同方面的著作编在一起出版。在社会学家们对和平共处问题的这种关心中，也表现出了现今社会舆论的影响，这种舆论完全有利于有效地保卫和平。
