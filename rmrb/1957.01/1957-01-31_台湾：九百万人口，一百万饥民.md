Taiwan: Nine Million People, One Million Starving
Gu Fan

Before the Spring Festival, Taiwan was conducting poverty surveys and registrations in various places. The Winter Relief Committees of each county and city were responsible for soliciting donations of cash and clothing from the public to provide relief to the starving people. According to the statistics released by the Kuomintang Taiwan Provincial Government's Department of Social Affairs, one of the most significant "achievements" of the Kuomintang's rule over Taiwan in recent years is the year-by-year increase in the number of poor people in Taiwan. The following are the statistics of the number of poor people in Taiwan Province compiled by the Taiwan Department of Social Affairs:

January 1948: 262,955 people.
January 1951: 545,863 people.
January 1956: More than 1,000,000 people.

In Taiwan, with a population of nine million, more than one million people need relief. That is to say, one out of every nine people is in need, which is already shocking enough. However, the number of poor people in Taiwan is now higher than it was a year ago. Although Taiwan newspapers have not yet published comprehensive statistics for the entire province, the statistics released by the Winter Relief Committees of individual counties and cities all indicate an increase in the number of poor people. In Taichung County, with a population of more than 530,000, there are currently more than 124,000 poor people in need of relief, averaging about one poor person for every four people. The number of poor households and people in Taipei City has nearly doubled in four years. The statistics released by the Taipei City Winter Relief Committee are as follows:

January 1954: 5,939 households, 28,639 people.
January 1955: 6,935 households, 33,877 people.
January 1956: 9,482 households, 47,525 people.
January 1957: 10,077 households, 51,667 people.

The standards for registering poor people in Taiwan are as follows: 1. Level 1 poor people – namely beggars. The definition is "those who cannot live without emergency relief"; 2. Level 2 poor people – famine victims living in slums who "cannot maintain their lives without the constant assistance of relatives and friends"; 3. Level 3 poor people – workers and small vendors living in slums with five or more children and low incomes who cannot support their families; 4. The dependents and family members of deceased Chiang soldiers are classified into various levels of poor people according to their degree of poverty.

Among the poor people registered in various counties and cities, beggars (i.e., Level 1 poor people) account for a considerable proportion. In Taipei County, there are currently more than 16,200 beggars, averaging one beggar for every forty-one people in the county. In the Penghu Islands, there are more than 2,000 beggars, also averaging one beggar for every forty residents. Many dependents of Chiang's soldiers and family members of deceased Chiang's soldiers have also been reduced to beggars and famine victims; in Taipei County, there are nearly 3,000 such people.

Taiwan newspapers admit that the number of beggars and famine victims in Taiwan is very large, which is an ironclad fact. However, the so-called "winter relief" is only symbolic and "fundamentally ineffective." For example, the relief funds that Taipei City is preparing to distribute to the poor before this Spring Festival total only 540,000 yuan (Taiwan dollars, same below). On average, each poor person can only receive 10 yuan in relief money. Ten Taiwan dollars can currently buy about five *shi jin* of rice in Taipei City, which is a drop in the bucket and far from enough to solve the hunger problem of beggars and famine victims who "cannot live without emergency relief."

It should be noted that of the 540,000 yuan of relief funds in Taipei City, more than 290,000 yuan was raised from people from all walks of life. The relief funds allocated by the Chiang Kai-shek group's Taipei Municipal Government only account for 250,000 yuan. In the past year, the Taipei "Municipal Government"'s expenses for entertaining "American allies" and others amounted to more than 170,000 yuan Taiwan dollars.

The Chiang Kai-shek group places the heavy burden of huge military and political expenses on the people of Taiwan, adopts a "killing the chicken to get the eggs" heavy tax policy, increases tax revenue year by year, and deepens the bankruptcy of Taiwan's rural areas and the decline of industry and commerce. A large number of workers, farmers, and fishermen have joined the ranks of the unemployed, which is one of the main reasons why the number of beggars and famine victims in Taiwan increases year by year. The Chiang Kai-shek group attempts to use the "winter relief" method to alleviate the resistance of the poor people who are suffering from hunger and cold. A Taiwan newspaper wrote: "Relief is for the safety of Taiwanese society. When people are hungry and cold and cannot get food and clothing, they will take one of the following three paths: the weak commit suicide, the strong take risks, and ordinary people mostly resort to theft... This is the meaning of holding winter relief."

Tragic events of famine victims dying of hunger, freezing to death, and committing suicide often occur in Taiwan. Last month, ten hungry young woodcutters in Zhuzihu, Caoshan, Taipei, went up the mountain to transport wood, resulting in five deaths from freezing and five from frostbite. Yang A-mei, a 72-year-old woman in Miaoli Township, wore only thin and tattered clothes that barely covered her body on a rainy morning, lay on the railway tracks, and committed suicide. Wu Jingyu, a young girl from Jiaoxi Township, Yilan County, and seven others went to the beach to pick seaweed to fill their hunger, but they were all swept away by the waves. Five were drowned, and Wu Chunxiang, who was rescued, was frightened to madness.

    台湾：九百万人口，一百万饥民
    古凡
    春节前，台湾各地都在进行贫民调查登记，并且由各县市的冬令救济委员会，负责向社会人士募捐现款和衣物，以便赈济饥民。从国民党台湾省政府社会处发表的统计数字来看，国民党统治台湾这些年来，最显著的“政绩”之一，是台湾贫民人数一年比一年增加。下面是台湾社会处统计的台湾省贫民人数：
    1948年1月二十六万二千九百五十五人。
    1951年1月五十四万五千八百六十三人。
    1956年1月一百万人以上。
    在九百万居民的台湾，有一百万人以上需要赈济。这就是说，每九个人中就有一名，这已经够骇人听闻的了。可是，现在台湾贫民的人数又比一年前增加了。虽然台湾报纸还没有刊登全省的综合统计数字，但个别县市冬令救济委员会发表的统计数字，都表明了贫民人数的增加。在有五十三万多人口的台中县，目前竟有十二万四千多贫民需要赈济，平均大约每四个人中就有一名贫民。台北市贫民户数和人数四年之间增加了将近一倍。台北市冬令救济委员会发表的统计如下：
    1954年1月五千九百三十九户二万八千六百三十九人。
    1955年1月六千九百三十五户三万三千八百七十七人。
    1956年1月九千四百八十二户四万七千五百二十五人。
    1957年1月一万零七十七户五万一千六百六十七人。
    台湾贫民登记的标准有下列几条：一、一级贫民——即乞丐。定义是“非施予紧急救济，无以为活者”；二、二级贫民——住在贫民窟中，“非时常得亲友之援助，无法维持生活”的饥民；三、三级贫民——住在贫民窟中的工人和小商贩，有子女五人以上，而收入低微，无法抚养家属的饥民；四、死亡蒋军官兵的遗眷和蒋军家属，依其贫穷程度分列入各级贫民中。
    在各县市所登记的贫民中，乞丐（即一级贫民）占了相当大的部分。在台北县，目前有一万六千二百多名乞丐，平均全县每四十一个人中，就有一名乞丐，在澎湖列岛，有二千多名乞丐，也是平均每四十个居民中就有一名乞丐。蒋军家眷和死亡蒋军遗属沦为乞丐和饥民的也不少，在台北县就有将近三千人。
    台湾报纸承认，台湾的乞丐和饥民的人数很多，这是铁一般的事实。但是所谓“冬令救济”，却只是象征性的，“根本无济于事”。例如台北市准备在这个春节前发放给贫民的赈济款项，一共只有五十四万多元（台币，下同）。平均每个贫民只能获得十元的救济金。十元台币目前在台北市大约可购买五市斤大米，杯水车薪，远不能解救“非施予紧急救济，无以为活”等乞丐和饥民的饥饿问题。
    应该说明，台北市五十四万多元台币的救济金，其中有二十九万多元是向社会各界人士募捐得来的。蒋介石集团台北市政府拨出的救济款项只占二十五万元。而在去年内，台北“市府”招待“美国盟友”等的餐费，即达十七万多元台币。
    蒋介石集团把浩大的军政费用开支的重担压在台湾人民的身上，采取“杀鸡取蛋”的重税政策，年年增加税收，加深了台湾农村破产、工商业雕零的程度，大批工人、农民和渔民走进失业的队伍，这是台湾乞丐和饥民人数年年增加的主要原因之一。蒋介石集团企图用“冬令救济”的办法，缓和饥寒交迫的贫民的反抗，一家台湾报纸写道：“救济是为了台湾社会的安全，人到饥寒而不得衣食的时候，不外走如下三条路：弱者自杀，强者挺而走险，普通人则多半沦为盗窃……这就是所以要举办冬令救济的意义。”
    饥民饿死、冻死和自杀的惨事，在台湾常常发生。上月，台北草山竹子湖十名饥饿的青年樵夫上山搬运木材，结果冻死了五人，冻僵了五人；苗栗镇七十二岁的老妇杨阿妹，在一个风雨交加的早晨穿着仅可蔽身的单薄破烂的衣服，卧在铁路轨道上自杀；宜兰县礁溪乡少女吴静玉等八人到海边拾海菜充饥，都被大浪卷走，五人被淹死了，获救的吴纯香被吓得疯癫了。
