　　From the day of its birth, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has fought for the interests of the entire nation and served the Chinese people wholeheartedly. Therefore, the people link their fate with the people's army and affectionately regard the people's army as their own "sons and brothers." Wherever the army goes, it forms a flesh-and-blood connection with the people there.
