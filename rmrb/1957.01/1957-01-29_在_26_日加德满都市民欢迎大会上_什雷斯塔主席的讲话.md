Chairman Shrestha's Speech at the Kathmandu City People's Welcome Rally on the 26th

The people of Nepal are very happy to be with you today. They feel very honored. The Kathmandu City Municipal Corporation would like to take this opportunity to welcome you here.

Nepal is located at the foothills of the Himalayas, shares a common border with your great country, and has established close and friendly relations with your country since ancient times. History proves this. Your historic visit to our country has further strengthened this friendly relationship.

Oh! Chinese revolutionary liberators!

Under the unparalleled wise leadership of Mao Zedong and yourself, the Chinese people have victoriously liberated your country from the domination of feudal lords and foreigners, and have now become masters of their own destiny. This has given hope and faith to the oppressed and backward people of Asia and Africa. Today, your country is accelerating its national development and construction; the whole world is watching it with amazement. All this is due to the superior leadership of people like you and the self-sacrifice, perseverance, and hard work of the great Chinese people.

Oh! Lovers of freedom and peace!

You are one of the founders of Panchsheel, and your great country is truly abiding by its principles. We are also a peace-loving nation. Our traditions and culture show this. The Nepalese people support your great country in upholding Panchsheel for all that it offers to world peace and suffering people.

We respectfully request you to convey our love and sincere respect to Chairman Mao Zedong and our brotherly Chinese people.

Long live the friendship between Nepal and China!

Long live world peace!

    在26日加德满都市民欢迎大会上
    什雷斯塔主席的讲话
    尼泊尔人民今天能够和你在一起感到十分高兴。他们感到很荣幸。加德满都市市政机构愿意趁这个机会在这里对你表示欢迎。
    尼泊尔位于喜马拉雅山的山麓，同你的伟大国家有着共同的边界，并且从太古的时代起就同贵国建立起亲密的友好关系。历史证明了这一点。你对我国的这次历史性的访问进一步加强了这种友好关系。
    哦！中国的革命解放者啊！
    中国人民在毛泽东和你的无比英明的领导下已经把贵国从封建主和外国人的支配下胜利地解放出来，现在已经成为他们自己命运的主人。这使亚洲和非洲被压迫的和落后的人民得到了希望和信念。今天，贵国正在加速进行国家开发和建设工作；全世界以惊奇的眼光在看待着它。这一切，都是因为有了像你那样的人物的超等领导才能和伟大中国人民的自我牺牲坚韧不拔和勤奋工作的缘故。
    哦！自由和和平的爱好者啊！
    你是潘查希拉的创始人之一，你的伟大的国家正在真正遵守着它的原则。我们也是一个爱好和平的民族。我们的传统和文化表明了这一点。尼泊尔人民支持你的伟大的国家维护潘查希拉对世界和平和受苦难人民所提供的一切。
    我们恭敬地请求你向毛泽东主席和我们的兄弟中国人民转达我们的热爱和真挚的敬意。
    尼中两国的友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
