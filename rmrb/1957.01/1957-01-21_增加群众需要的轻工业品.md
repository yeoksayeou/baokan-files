Xinhua News Agency, January 17th: In 1956, China's light industrial enterprises produced a wide variety of daily necessities for the people of minority areas.

　　Among the enamel products, there were Soviet-style enamel stew pots and duckbill kettles suitable for the Uyghur people of Xinjiang, and milk buckets, Mongolian bowls, dragon-flower washbasins, and lidded cups suitable for the Mongolian people. The washbasins and mugs also had minority characters on them. These enamel products have many colors, are light, conduct heat quickly, and are easy to clean.

　　Among textiles and clothing, there are novel cotton hats and lined hats suitable for the Tibetan people. The hats come in different shapes such as pointed, flat, and rolled brims, and are beautiful and have ethnic characteristics. The trial-produced No. 33-38 women's lightweight rain boots have a white upper and a green lower part, with a delicate style and comfortable wearing. In addition, there are various fabrics and knitted goods of different shades of color suitable for making clothes for Tibetan and Mongolian people.

　　Among cosmetics, there is White Elephant brand high-grade soap. This soap is made of tallow, coconut, and wood oil. It does not irritate the skin, has strong detergency, produces a lot of foam, and has pure oil quality.

　　In addition, antimony pots, which used to be imported from abroad, have also been successfully trial-produced. This product is very light and easy to carry.

　　These daily necessities were welcomed by the people of minority nationalities after being transported to Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia and other regions.

Children welcome sweets and toys

　　Xinhua News Agency, January 18th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Zhiqing reported: In 1956, light industrial enterprise employees produced a wide variety of foods, supplies, and toys for children. These products were very popular with children after they appeared on the market.

　　The Tianming chewing gum, cream lozenges, beef juice lactose, etc. produced for children last year do not contain citric acid and can protect children's teeth from acid erosion. In particular, beef juice lactose has high nutritional content and is refreshing and soothing. Banana powder made from bananas can increase nutrition and stimulate appetite for children. The cream-filled biscuits, cream Koukou bayberry cakes and other pastries produced for children contain different flavored fruit juices, which are sweet, crispy and easy to digest.

　　Among the daily necessities produced for children last year, there were many different styles of toy soaps. These soaps are made into the shapes of pigeons, rabbits, goldfish, ducks, and elephants, and are matched with various soap colors, which are bright and lovely. Toy soap is low in alkalinity and does not irritate the skin. Using this soap for children can guide them to develop good hygiene habits. In addition, small tubes of toothpaste and small toothbrushes were also produced for children. In order to protect the development of children's teeth, in addition to adding more sweetness than ordinary toothpaste, the proportion of calcium is also relatively high in the toothpaste raw materials, with more foam, cool and refreshing, and has the effect of cleaning the mouth and sterilizing and reducing inflammation.

　　Among the more than 100 new styles of children's clothing produced last year, there are corduroy vests suitable for children aged one to ten. This vest has no sleeves, and it is more convenient to wear than a sleeved cotton jacket. There are more than 40 patterns of broken outerwear for children. This kind of clothing can be worn in spring, autumn and winter, which is both economical and beautiful. Printed oil bibs prevent water from seeping through even if it is spilled on the body when children wear them for eating and drinking, and they are most suitable for children aged two to four. In addition, there are printed small handkerchiefs and fleece clothes, sweaters, gloves, etc.

　　Last year, employees of light industrial enterprises also produced many kinds of toys for children. One of them, called "Ball Game", is very suitable for children to play in groups. It can exercise children's wit, agility and meticulousness. Another toy, "Literacy Six-Sided Picture", has six patterns painted on a wooden block. The pictures include cars, airplanes, carriages, fish, shrimps, etc. These patterns are brightly colored. It is not only a fun toy, but also can help children learn to read. Among the toys, there are also small pots, small basins, small bowls, etc., which are suitable for girls to play with and can educate girls to develop the habit of participating in housework.
