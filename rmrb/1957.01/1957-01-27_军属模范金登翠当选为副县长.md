Xinhua News Agency, Wenzhou, 26th. Jin Dencui, a 23-year-old military dependent, was recently elected as the Deputy County Head of Qingyuan County, Zhejiang Province.

In the spring of 1953, after Jin Dencui encouraged her husband, Li Yuanguang, to join the army, she promised him that she would actively work and work hard to shoulder the burden of the family. Her husband also often wrote to encourage her to play a model role in production work. Therefore, Jin Dencui worked as hard as men, whether going up the mountains or down to the fields. Under her influence, local women changed their habit of not going to the fields and generally participated in field production. When the village began to establish elementary cooperatives in the autumn of the year before last, she often traveled more than ten miles in the dark to promote the idea to the farmers, breaking down their ideological concerns about joining the cooperatives, and the elementary cooperatives were quickly established. Last February, when the village established advanced cooperatives, she patiently persuaded more than 40 farmers who originally had ideological concerns to join the cooperatives. At the same time, she also contributed a large buffalo that the county had awarded her to the cooperative without compensation, solving the cooperative's difficulty in lacking funds, and she was elected as the head of the advanced cooperative.

Because Jin Dencui worked actively, her elderly parents-in-law lived a good life, reducing the state's relief burden. She is usually very respectful and considerate to her in-laws.

In her work, she has always been hardworking, thorough, and active. She has been successively rated as a model worker in the district and township, and a first-class model military dependent in the county, and has been elected as a county people's representative. Many people in the local villages and towns say that she is a good Party member, a good daughter-in-law, and a good sister-in-law.

    军属模范金登翠当选为副县长
    据新华社温州26日电　二十三岁的军属金登翠最近当选为浙江省庆元县副县长。
    1953年春天金登翠鼓励丈夫李元光参军后，她向丈夫保证要积极劳动、努力工作，把家庭的担子挑起来。她丈夫也经常写信鼓励她在生产工作中起模范作用。因此，金登翠不论上山下田，都和男人一样劳动。当地妇女在她的影响下，改变了不下田的习惯，普遍参加田间生产。前年秋天村里开始办初级社的时候，她经常黑夜里跑十多里路去向农民进行宣传，打破农民入社的思想顾虑，使初级社很快就办了起来。去年2月村里办高级社，她又耐心说服了四十多户原来有思想顾虑的农民入了社，同时还把县里奖励她的一条大水牛无价入了社，解决了社里缺乏资金的困难，她并且被选为高级社社长。
    由于金登翠积极劳动，使年老的公公婆婆生活过得好，减少了国家的救济。平时她对公婆也十分尊敬、体贴。
    她在工作中一贯艰苦深入、积极努力，先后被评为区、乡工作模范和县一等军属模范，并且被选为县人民代表。当地乡村很多人都说她是好党员、好媳妇、好嫂嫂。
