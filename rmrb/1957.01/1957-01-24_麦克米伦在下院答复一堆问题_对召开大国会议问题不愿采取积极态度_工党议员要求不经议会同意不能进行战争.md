Xinhua News Agency, London, January 23rd: When the new Prime Minister Macmillan made his first appearance in the House of Commons on the 22nd, Labor MPs remained silent. Although Conservative MPs applauded, they did not offer him the special respect of waving order papers as was customary.

MPs posed a number of questions to him in writing and orally. In a written response to Labor MP Brockway, he stated that he did not believe the time was ripe for a great power conference on the Middle East, Europe, and the Far East. Brockway had asked him whether he had consulted with representatives from France, the United States, India, and the Soviet Union on convening a great power conference. Macmillan replied: "Not once."

Conservative MP Boles suggested inviting Eisenhower to Britain for high-level talks. Macmillan replied: "I share your view on the significance of these meetings and consultations, but I have nothing to discuss at present."

Answering questions from MPs about the disarmament talks, Macmillan believed that the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee should study the proposals of the Soviet Union and the United States. He insisted that the Anglo-French phased disarmament plan was a "satisfactory" method. He said that Britain was prepared to consider the issue of "limiting the possibility of nuclear weapons test explosions."

On the 22nd, Macmillan also rejected a motion proposed by Labor MP Wood to prohibit going to war without the prior consent of Parliament. The news said that Wood proposed the motion to prevent a recurrence of events like Eden's launch of the war against Egypt without the consent of Parliament.

    麦克米伦在下院答复一堆问题
    对召开大国会议问题不愿采取积极态度
    工党议员要求不经议会同意不能进行战争
    据新华社23日讯　伦敦消息：英国下院22日复会。当新任首相麦克米伦第一次在下院露面的时候，工党议员一声不响，保守党议员虽然鼓掌，但是没有像习惯那样用挥舞议程单来向他致以特别的敬意。
    议员们用书面方式或在口头上向他提出了一些问题。他在给工党议员布罗克威的一个书面答复中表示，他认为就中东、欧洲和远东问题召开一次大国会议的时机还没有成熟。布罗克威曾问他，有没有就召开大国会议跟法国、美国、印度和苏联代表作过什么商谈。麦克米伦答复说：“一次也没有。”
    保守党议员布勒斯建议请艾森豪威尔到英国来作高级会谈。麦克米伦答复说：“对于这些会议和商谈的意义，我也有你那样的看法，但目前我还没有什么可谈。”
    在回答议员提出的有关裁军谈判的情况时，麦克米伦认为联合国裁军小组委员会应该研究苏联和美国的建议。他坚持英法的分阶段裁军计划是“令人满意”的方法。他说，英国准备考虑“限制核子武器试验爆炸的可能性”的问题。
    麦克米伦22日还拒绝了工党议员伍德提出的禁止不事先经过议会同意就进行战争的动议。消息说，伍德提出这项动议，是要制止像艾登那样不经过议会同意就发动对埃及战争的事件的重演。
