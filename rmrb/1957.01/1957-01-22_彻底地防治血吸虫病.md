Editorial:

    Over the past year, large-scale mass prevention and control work has been carried out in the rice-growing areas of the twelve provinces (cities) in China where schistosomiasis is prevalent, achieving significant results. According to incomplete statistics, more than 400,000 patients have been treated in these areas (this number is equivalent to 237% of the total number of patients treated in the previous six years since liberation), and snail eradication work has been carried out in areas with Oncomelania hupensis snails. According to surveys, in places where three standard snail eradication efforts have been carried out, the snail eradication rate can reach more than 95%, and some villages have completely eliminated Oncomelania hupensis snails. This fact proves that it is entirely possible to eliminate Oncomelania hupensis snails.
    Currently, in areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent, most of the leading organs of the Party and government at and above the township level have established specialized institutions for prevention and control work, organized teams for prevention and control work, and conducted widespread investigations and pilot projects. These areas have mobilized and organized scientific and technological forces and mobilized the masses. Some effective experiences have also been gained in the actual prevention and control work. For example, in lake and marsh areas, snail eradication is carried out in conjunction with water conservancy construction and winter plowing; in general areas, methods such as gas flame spraying, boiling water spraying, and drugs such as tea seed cake and Daphne genkwa are used for snail eradication. The steps for snail eradication are from point to surface, from near to far, from local to whole, starting from the surroundings of villages and gradually reaching complete elimination of Oncomelania hupensis snails. In terms of treatment, the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine has been affirmed, which has a significant effect on striving to accelerate the completion of treatment tasks. As long as we continue to work hard and persevere, we will definitely be able to complete the task of basically eliminating schistosomiasis within seven years.
    Based on the experience of prevention and control work in the past year, because the schistosomiasis epidemic area is large, there are many patients, infection is easy, and the recurrence rate is high, the prevention and control work must implement the principle of active prevention and control, take comprehensive measures, and earnestly implement the methods of fully mobilizing the masses and combining science and technology, combining prevention and control work with water conservancy construction and agricultural production, and resolutely carry out repeated struggles in order to achieve the final victory. Some comrades put treatment and prevention in opposition to each other, so some advocate treatment as the main focus, while others advocate prevention as the main focus. But in fact, both prevention and treatment must be given equal importance, otherwise, it will inevitably lead to paying attention to one thing and losing sight of the other, resulting in a situation where prevention is impossible to prevent and treatment is impossible to treat. Some people put prevention and control work in opposition to agricultural production, so some advocate that prevention and control work should "override everything," while others believe that prevention and control work will hinder production. They do not understand that prevention and control work is precisely to serve the development of agricultural production, and in specific measures, it can be completely combined. In fact, many areas have found specific methods for various specific measures of prevention or treatment that are effective, cost-effective, take into account both prevention and control and production, benefit both, and are easy for the masses to promote, and have successfully achieved the task of prevention and control. All regions should promptly summarize these successful experiences, encourage the creativity of cadres and the masses, and promote these effective experiences in accordance with the specific situation and conditions at the time and place. We must look downwards, rely on the masses, proceed from reality, and prevent formalism, extravagance and waste, mechanically copying foreign experiences, and coercive orders and other deviations from reality and the masses in prevention and control work.
    Now the masses in the schistosomiasis-prevalent areas have been initially mobilized, but it must also be seen that the mobilization of the masses is not very sufficient, and some ideological problems of many masses have not been resolved. In some areas with milder conditions, some of the masses still have a paralyzing mentality. In some areas with severe diseases, many of the masses have pessimistic and disappointed emotions. These erroneous ideological emotions should be eliminated through propaganda and education, promotion of scientific knowledge, and practical experience in prevention and control work. At the same time, it must be repeatedly explained to the masses that neither snail eradication, egg eradication, personal protection, nor treatment can be effective at once, and that prevention and control work cannot be hot and cold, but must be carried out in repeated and protracted struggles in order to achieve the final victory.
    After the mass prevention and control movement has been launched in various places, scientific and technological work must follow up in a timely manner, and concentrate efforts within a certain period to study and solve oral antimony agents and find other new drugs that are effective, cost-effective, have few reactions, and are easy to use, in order to quickly complete the heavy treatment tasks. The existing prevention and control experience of the masses should be scientifically tested and summarized, and those advanced experiences that are indeed effective and easy to implement should be effectively promoted. The organization of treatment work should also be as simple as possible. For example, in towns, outpatient treatment can be implemented according to conditions, and in rural areas, mobile treatment can be implemented in communities according to conditions. At the same time, it is necessary to further strengthen the unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and promote the style of serving the masses, being diligent and thrifty in prevention and control work, and oppose practices that disregard conditions and deviate from reality.
    In order to deeply launch the struggle to prevent and control schistosomiasis, the Party organizations in the relevant areas should grasp four key links in leadership: The first is to grasp the guiding principles and policies, and ensure that the various tasks and policies of prevention and control work can be implemented. The second is to strengthen ideological and political work, fully mobilize the masses, and carry out the prevention and control struggle for a long time. The third is to strengthen organizational leadership. Party committees at and above the county level must establish leading groups including leading cadres from agriculture, health, water conservancy, and other relevant departments to unify leadership, cooperate in combat, and include the prevention and control tasks of each period in the rural work plan of each period. The Party's primary organizations should closely rely on agricultural cooperatives and specifically arrange prevention and control work according to the conditions of production. The fourth is to mobilize scientific and technological forces so that they are closely integrated with the strength of the masses. Starting from the above four aspects, we can resolutely carry out the struggle to prevent and control schistosomiasis to the end and achieve the final victory.

    彻底地防治血吸虫病
    过去一年来，我国流行血吸虫病的十二个省（市）的水稻作物地区，已经进行了大规模的群众性的防治工作，取得了重大的成绩。据不完全统计，在这些地区已经治疗了四十万名以上的病人（这个数字相当于解放以来前六年治疗病人总数的237％），已经在有钉螺的地区进行了灭螺的工作。据调查，凡是经过了三次合于标准的灭螺工作的地方，灭螺率可以达到95％以上，有的乡村已经全部消灭了钉螺。这个事实证明消灭钉螺是完全可能的。
    目前在血吸虫病流行的地区中，绝大部分乡级以上党和政府的各级领导机关，都已经建立了防治工作的专门机构，组织了防治工作的队伍，普遍地进行了调查和试点工作。这些地区都动员和组织了科学技术力量，发动了群众。在实际的防治工作中还取得了一些有效的经验。例如，在湖沼地区，结合兴修水利、冬耕等工作，进行灭螺；在一般地区采用煤气火焰喷射、沸水喷射等方法和茶子饼、闹羊花等药物进行灭螺。在灭螺的步骤上由点到面、由近到远、由局部到全部，先由村庄周围做起，逐步达到全部消灭钉螺。在治疗方面，肯定了中医中药的疗效，这对于争取加快完成治疗任务有重大的作用。只要我们继续努力，坚持到底，就一定可以在七年内完成基本消灭血吸虫病的任务。
    根据一年来防治工作的经验，由于血吸虫病疫区大，病人多，感染容易，复发率高，防治工作必须实行积极防治的方针，采取综合性措施，切实贯彻充分发动群众和科学技术相结合、防治工作和兴修水利、发展农业生产相结合的办法，坚决进行反复的斗争，才能取得最后的胜利。有些同志把治疗和预防对立起来，因此有人主张治疗为主，有人主张预防为主。但是实际上必须防治并重，否则必致顾此失彼，造成防不胜防、治不胜治的情况。有些人把防治工作和农业生产对立起来，因而有的主张防治工作应当“压倒一切”，有的认为防治工作会妨碍生产。他们不了解防治工作正是为发展农业生产服务的，在具体措施上是完全可以结合的。事实上，许多地区无论预防或治疗的各项具体措施，都找到收效大、花钱少、对防治和生产兼顾而且两利、又便于群众推广的具体办法，顺利地实现了防治的任务。各地应当及时总结这些成功的经验，鼓励干部和群众的创造性，并且按照当时当地的具体情况和条件，推广这些有效的经验。要眼睛向下，依靠群众，从实际出发，防止防治工作中的形式主义、铺张浪费、生搬硬套外地经验以及强迫命令等等脱离实际、脱离群众的偏向。
    现在血吸虫病流行地区的群众已经初步发动起来了，但是还必须看到群众发动不是很充分的，不少群众的一些思想问题还没有得到解决。在一部分病情较轻的地区，有些群众还有麻痹思想。在一部分病害严重的地区，有许多群众又有悲观失望情绪。对于这些错误的思想情绪应当通过宣传教育、推广科学知识和防治工作的实际经验，加以破除。同时，必须反复向群众说明：不论灭螺、灭卵、个人防护和治疗工作，都不可能一次奏效，对待防治工作不可忽冷忽热，而必须进行反复的持久的斗争，才能取得最后的胜利。
    在各地群众性的防治运动已经展开以后，科学技术工作要及时地跟上去，在一定时期内集中力量研究解决口服锑剂和寻找其他疗效大、花钱省、反应少、使用简便的新药，以利于迅速完成繁重的治疗任务。对于群众现有的防治经验，应当从科学技术上给以检定和总结，切实地推广那些确有成效而又简便易行的先进经验。在治疗工作的组织上也应当力求简便。例如，在市镇上可以根据条件实行门诊治疗，在农村中可以根据条件实行驻社巡回治疗。同时，必须进一步加强中西医的团结和合作，在防治工作中提倡便利群众、勤俭办事的作风，反对不顾条件、脱离实际的做法。
    为了深入地展开防治血吸虫病的斗争，有关地区的党组织在领导上应当抓住四个环节：第一是掌握方针政策，保证防治工作的各项任务和政策能够贯彻执行。第二是加强思想政治工作，充分发动群众，持久地进行防治斗争。第三是加强组织领导，县级以上党委必须建立包括农业、卫生、水利等有关部门领导干部在内的领导小组，统一领导，协同作战，并且把每个时期的防治任务列入每个时期的农村工作计划。党的基层组织应该紧密地依靠农业合作社，根据生产的条件，具体地安排防治工作。第四是把科学技术力量动员起来，使它和群众的力量密切地结合起来。从上述这四个方面着手，就可以把防治血吸虫病的斗争坚决地进行到底，取得最后的胜利。
