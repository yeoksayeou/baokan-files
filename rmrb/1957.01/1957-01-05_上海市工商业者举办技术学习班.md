Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd. The first technical training class for Shanghai's industrialists and businessmen—the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Circles' Spare-Time Tutoring School's Commercial Accounting Class—commenced on December 30, 1956.

　　This accounting class is jointly sponsored by the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce and relevant units such as the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association. The first group of more than 300 students are all private individuals from joint state-private stores. Over the next four months, they will systematically study the principles of socialist commercial accounting and business techniques, so as to acquire a skill and gradually transform themselves into self-reliant laborers.

　　The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Circles' Spare-Time Tutoring School is currently also planning an industrial technology class for private individuals and small business owners from joint state-private factories.

    上海市工商业者举办技术学习班
    新华社上海2日电　为上海市工商业者举办的第一个技术学习班——上海市工商界业余补习学校商业会计班，已在1956年12月30日开学。
    这个会计班是上海市工商业联合会邀请中国民主建国会上海市委员会等有关单位共同主办的。第一期学员三百多人，都是公私合营商店的私方人员。他们将在四个月内，系统地学习社会主义商业会计原理与业务技术等课程，以便学得一技之长，逐步使自己改造成为自食其力的劳动者。
    上海市工商界业余补习学校目前还在为公私合营工厂的私方人员和小业主筹办一个工业技术班。
