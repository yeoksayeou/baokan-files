Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 7th: The Nantong Coal Mine promoted three experiences in 1956, relying on the masses to inspect and supervise production, which significantly improved work in safety, cost, and quality.

	The mass-based safety inspection network is an experience that has been widely promoted throughout the mine. It is composed of experienced workers who value safety, selected from various production teams. Because safety work has become a mass-based action, the mine eliminated fatal accidents in the second half of last year, and serious injuries decreased by 50% compared to the same period in 1955. At present, there are more than 100 safety inspectors in the mine. Since the third quarter of last year, they have put forward more than 1,000 opinions on safe production, more than 90% of which have been adopted, playing a great role in ensuring production safety.

	The Nantong Coal Mine has also successively promoted the experiences of mass-based cost inspection networks and quality inspection networks. These two inspection networks are composed of workers who have better production technology and a strong sense of responsibility, selected from each production team without leaving their production posts. Cost inspectors actively expose and stop rework and waste in production, and educate and motivate the masses to carry out various conservation activities. Since the establishment of the cost inspection network in the tunneling area in November last year, cost inspectors have put forward more than 200 opinions on reducing costs, which reduced the cost of the entire area by more than 10,000 yuan in November and December. Cost inspector Zhang Beihai and others from the coal mining area discovered that some workers were using large timber for small purposes and long timber for short purposes. They patiently persuaded and educated them, and personally helped to carry compliant timber and old timber, promoting timber conservation throughout the area.

	The mine's coal quality inspectors also regularly conduct publicity and education work to improve coal quality, and fight against phenomena that neglect coal quality, which has promoted the improvement of coal quality.

    南桐煤矿充分依靠群众办企业
    大力推广安全检查网、成本检查网、质量检查网等先进经验
    新华社重庆7日电　南桐煤矿在1956年里推行了三种依靠群众检查、监督生产的经验，使安全、成本和质量方面的工作有显著改进。
    群众性的安全检查网，是全矿普遍推行的一种经验。它是由各个生产班选出经验丰富、重视安全的工人组成的。由于安全工作变成了群众性的行动，去年下半年这个矿消灭了死亡事故，重伤比1955年同期降低了50％。现在全矿共有安全检查员一百多人，他们从去年第三季度以来，先后提出了有关安全生产的意见一千多条，其中90％以上都被采纳，对保证生产安全起到很大作用。
    南桐煤矿还先后推行了群众性的成本检查网和质量检查网的经验。这两项检查网，是由各生产班分别选出一个生产技术较好、责任心强的不脱离生产岗位的工人组成的。成本检查员们在生产上积极揭发和制止返工浪费现象，并且教育和带动群众开展各种节约活动。掘进区从去年11月成立成本检查网以来，成本检查员先后提出了两百多条有关降低成本的意见，使全区11月和12月的成本，比计划降低了一万多元。采煤区的成本检查员张北海等，发现井下有些工人将坑木大材小用、长材短用等情况，就耐心地说服教育，并且亲自帮助搬运符合规格的坑木和旧坑木，推动了全区的坑木节约工作。
    全矿的煤质检查员也经常进行提高煤质的宣传教育工作，并同忽视煤质的现象作斗争，对提高煤的质量起了推动作用。
