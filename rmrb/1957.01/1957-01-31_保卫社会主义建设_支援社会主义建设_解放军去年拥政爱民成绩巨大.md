    The People's Liberation Army made tremendous contributions to supporting national socialist construction and assisting the people in developing production in 1956, while defending the motherland and carrying out modernization and regularization, and continuing to promote the glorious tradition of supporting the government and cherishing the people.
    The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are the heroic defenders of the motherland's construction. The soldiers guarding the borders and coasts endure many hardships, taking mountains as their barracks and desolate islands as their homes, day and night, defending the security of the motherland and allowing the people of the whole country to enjoy the conditions for peaceful construction. During the busy farming and fishing seasons, the coastal defense forces on the Fujian front often dispatch aircraft and warships and increase the number of on-duty artillery pieces to directly protect the production of coastal people and fishermen.
    The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army maintain and promote the revolutionary character of being both a fighting force and a working force. During the upsurge of agricultural cooperation throughout the country, the entire army launched a large-scale movement to "support peasant brothers in taking the socialist road." Many units formed work teams and, under the unified leadership of local party committees, participated in the establishment and rectification of agricultural cooperatives. The Public Security Army units stationed in Yunnan sent more than 1,000 people to form work groups to help farmers of all ethnic groups in Yunnan establish 78 agricultural production cooperatives. The troops on the Fujian front, amidst the tense struggle against the enemy, drew nearly 1,000 officers and soldiers to form 46 work groups, participating in the socialist transformation of agriculture, fisheries, and handicrafts in 28 coastal counties and cities. Many units helped agricultural cooperatives to run training classes in accounting, hygiene, and veterinary medicine, established maternity stations and medical stations, and opened cultural night schools. Signal corps units helped set up a total of more than 6,500 kilometers of telephone and broadcasting lines in rural areas and suburbs.
    During the busy production season for the masses, PLA units formed labor armies to help farmers reclaim wasteland, sow seeds, weed, harvest, and build reservoirs and canals, and construct bridges and roads. The Xinjiang Military Region production units imparted production techniques and carried out political work in agricultural cooperatives, helping 185 agricultural cooperatives in Xinjiang to reap a bumper harvest last year. Troops stationed in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and other places built more than 60 reservoirs and ponds for rural areas. The troops stationed in Yunnan worked with the local people to build the "Dongbaisha Reservoir," which greatly improved the irrigation of vast areas of farmland. Officers and soldiers of organs and units stationed in Beijing used more than 130,000 workdays to participate in projects such as the water diversion project of the Yongding River and the expansion of the Yuyuantan Lake.
    The vast numbers of officers and soldiers also actively participated in eliminating pests and harmful animals and planting trees and protecting forests. According to statistics from 20 units, a total of more than 45.3 million trees were planted last spring. In May last year, relatively serious fires occurred in the forest areas of Huma and Nenjiang in Heilongjiang and the Oroqen Autonomous Banner in Inner Mongolia. The PLA troops stationed in these areas bravely participated in the firefighting, which quickly stopped the fires and protected the country's forest resources. Troops stationed in Yunnan, Jiangxi and other places also frequently organized manpower to go up the mountains to encircle and suppress harmful animals.
    In order to help rural areas increase production, the PLA launched a donation campaign for tractors last year. Officers and soldiers of the entire army donated 17,928,000 yuan to purchase tractors, and have already built eight tractor stations in Yan'an, Beijing, Xuchang, and other places. In addition, more than 2,700 double-wheeled, double-furrow plows, more than 13,000 other farm implements, more than 300 million jin of fertilizer, and more than 1.13 million yuan in cash were donated to agricultural cooperatives.
    Last year, many areas in our country suffered from floods, droughts, and wind disasters. Troops stationed in these areas actively participated in rescue and disaster relief work. Between spring and summer, drought appeared in Guangdong, Hainan Island and other places, and local troops did their best to assist the masses in digging wells, opening canals, watering, and replanting. In autumn, Zhejiang, Shandong, Heilongjiang and other places suffered from typhoons or floods. Officers and soldiers of many units worked with the local people to heroically rescue state materials and people's lives and property. During the typhoon, the troops stationed in Zhejiang rescued more than 1,600 disaster victims, more than 1.6 million jin of grain, more than 500 head of livestock, and other large quantities of materials. Pilots and ground crew of the Air Force, regardless of the pouring rain, dispatched aircraft day after day to drop batches of life-saving equipment and food to the masses surrounded by floods. The troops stationed in Harbin guarded the key sections of the Songhua River dike day and night in the rain.
    The officers and soldiers of the PLA demonstrated the great spirit of sharing weal and woe with the people. After the typhoons and floods, the vast numbers of officers and soldiers tightened their belts, donating their savings, grain, clothing, and other daily necessities to the disaster-stricken people, and sent medical teams to treat the disaster victims. According to incomplete statistics, more than 857,000 yuan in cash and more than 800,000 pieces of clothing of various kinds were donated, and a large number of condolence letters were written. The troops stationed in the disaster areas provided more assistance to the disaster-stricken masses in various aspects, such as draining water from farmland, repairing collapsed houses, preventing and controlling diseases, and helping to develop sideline production. This greatly encouraged the masses to overcome difficulties and tide over the disaster.
    Over the past year, the People's Liberation Army has also supported the country's industry, transportation, and urban construction in various ways. The Railway Corps fully participated in the construction of the Yingxia Railway project last year and completed this arduous project ahead of schedule according to the original plan, saving the country a lot of materials and funds. In order to help the country relieve the tension in the transportation of materials in various places, the East China Sea Fleet of the Navy dispatched various types of ships to transport back and forth on the Yangtze River route between Chongqing, Hankou and Shanghai. It safely transported more than 75.5 million ton-kilometers of materials in three months, basically dispersing the accumulated materials at the ports along the Yangtze River. The Beijing-Tianjin Garrison Automobile Unit transported more than 111,000 tons of building materials for various construction sites in Beijing at the end of last year, providing timely support for various construction projects in the city. In Tianjin, the troops dispatched more than 200 cars and horse-drawn carts to participate in transportation, which basically eliminated the tense transportation situation in Tianjin since the beginning of winter. Other technical arms also participated in and supported various national construction undertakings. For example, the Air Force participated in opening up the Beijing-Lhasa route, and the surveying and mapping soldiers participated in the surveying and mapping work of national basic construction projects. They have all made good contributions to the country's economic construction.
    In order to enable the country to concentrate more construction funds, officers and soldiers of the entire army actively purchased the 1956 national economic construction bonds, and the amount paid exceeded the purchase amount allocated to the troops by more than 50%. Many units launched mass savings campaigns and put forward many rationalization proposals. The canteens of the units stationed in the Nanjing area saved more than 6 million jin of coal in the first half of last year due to improved stoves and cooking methods. The automobile units under the Xinjiang Military Region carried out a safe, economical, 100,000-kilometer overhaul-free movement. The gasoline, tires, and maintenance costs saved in ten months can be converted into cash to purchase 50 new "Jiefang" brand trucks. Some troops stationed on islands and border areas also produced their own supplies to reduce the country's supply.
    Because the army loves the people, the people care for their own soldiers infinitely. They actively solved various difficulties for the troops, assisted the troops in guarding the borders, building bridges and roads, and transporting materials. This has played a great role in the PLA's successful completion of the tasks of consolidating national defense and combat training.

    保卫社会主义建设　支援社会主义建设
    解放军去年拥政爱民成绩巨大
    本报讯　中国人民解放军1956年在保卫祖国和进行现代化正规化建设的同时，继续发扬了拥政爱民的光荣传统，在支援国家社会主义建设和帮助人民群众发展生产方面，作出了巨大的贡献。
    解放军官兵是祖国建设的英勇保卫者。守卫在边防和海防的战士们，成年累月，日日夜夜，以高山为营，荒岛为家，经受许多艰难困苦，保卫祖国的安全，使全国人民享有和平建设的条件。在农忙和渔汛季节，福建前线的海防部队经常派出飞机和舰艇，增加值班炮火，直接保卫了沿海人民和渔民的生产。
    人民解放军官兵保持和发扬了既是战斗队又是工作队的革命本色。在全国农业合作化高潮中，解放军全军发起了“支援农民兄弟走社会主义道路”的大规模运动。许多部队组成工作队，在各地党委的统一领导下，参加农民的建社和整社工作。驻云南的公安军部队，就派出了一千多人组成工作组，帮助云南各族农民建立了七十八个农业生产合作社。福建前线的部队在紧张的对敌斗争中，抽出了官兵近千名，组成四十六个工作组，参加了沿海二十八个县、市的农业、渔业和手工业社会主义改造工作。许多部队帮助农业社开办了会计、卫生、兽医等训练班，建立了接生站和医疗站，开办了文化夜校。各单位的通信兵在农村和市郊帮助架设的电话、广播线路共长六千五百多公里。
    在群众生产紧张繁忙的季节，解放军各部队组成劳动大军，帮助农民开荒、播种、锄草、收割和建造水库水渠、架桥修路等。新疆军区生产部队向农业社传授生产技术和进行政治工作，帮助新疆的一百八十五个农业社在去年获得了丰收。驻江苏、浙江、江西等地部队，就为各地农村建设了六十多个水库、水塘。驻云南部队和当地人民一起修建了“东白沙水库”，使广大农田得到良好的灌溉。驻北京市的机关、部队官兵曾用十三万多个劳动日参加永定河的引水工程和扩大玉渊潭湖面等工程。
    广大官兵还踊跃参加灭除害虫害兽和植树护林工作。据二十个单位的统计，去年春天共植树四千五百三十多万株。去年5月，黑龙江呼玛、嫩江和内蒙古自治区鄂伦春族等森林区曾发生较严重的火灾，驻在这些地区的解放军奋勇参加扑救，使火灾得以迅速制止，保护了祖国的森林资源。驻云南、江西等地部队还经常组织人力上山围剿害兽。
    为了帮助各地农村增加生产，去年解放军掀起了捐献拖拉机运动。全军官兵捐赠购买拖拉机的现款达一千七百九十二万八千元，并且已经在延安、北京、许昌等地建成了八个拖拉机站。此外，赠送给农业社双轮双铧犁两千七百多部，其他农具一万三千多件，肥料三亿多斤，现款一百一十三万多元。
    去年我国不少地区遭受水、旱、风灾，驻在这些地区的部队踊跃参加抢险救灾工作。春夏之间，广东、海南岛等地呈现旱象，当地部队全力协助群众打井、开渠、浇水和抢种。秋季，浙江、山东、黑龙江等地遭受台风或洪水灾害，许多部队的官兵和当地人民一起英勇地抢救国家物资和人民生命财产。驻浙江部队在台风袭击的时候，救出了一千六百多名灾民，救出粮食一百六十多万斤，牲口五百多头及其他大量物资。空军部队的飞行员和地勤人员，不顾倾盆大雨，连日出动飞机，把一批批的救生器材、食物，投给被洪水包围的群众。驻哈尔滨市的部队，日夜冒雨防护着松花江大堤的险要地段。
    解放军官兵表现了和人民同甘苦共命运的伟大精神。广大官兵在台风和水灾过后，纷纷节衣缩食，把节省下来的钱、粮食和衣服等日用品捐赠给受灾人民，并派出医疗队为灾民治病。据不完全的统计，共捐献现金八十五万七千多元，各种衣物八十多万件，并写了大批的慰问信。驻灾区部队对受灾群众更进行了多方面的帮助，如排除农田积水，修理倒塌的房屋，防治病疫，帮助开展副业生产。这就大大鼓舞了群众克服困难、渡过灾荒的信心。
    一年来，人民解放军还从各方面支援了国家的工业、交通运输和城市建设。铁道兵部队在去年一年全力参加了修建鹰厦铁路工程，并按原定计划提前完成了这一艰巨的工程，为国家节约了大量的器材和资金。为了协助国家解除各地物资运输的紧张情况，海军东海舰队派出了各式舰只在重庆、汉口和上海间的长江航线上往返运输。三个月安全运输物资七千五百五十多万吨公里。基本上疏散了长江各口岸被压积的物资。京津卫戍区汽车部队在去年年底为北京市各建筑工地运送了十一万一千多吨建筑材料，及时地支援了市内各项建筑工程。在天津，部队派出了二百多辆汽车和马车参加运输，使天津市入冬以来的运输紧张状态基本上消除。其他各技术兵种也都参加和支援了国家各项建设事业。如空军参加开辟北京—拉萨航线，测绘兵参加国家基本建设工程的测绘工作，工程兵参加修建桥梁、公路等。他们都对国家经济建设作出了良好的贡献。
    为了使国家集中更多的建设资金，全军官兵踊跃地认购了1956年国家经济建设公债，缴款数超过国家分配给部队的认购数字50％以上。许多部队开展了群众性的节约运动，提出了不少合理化建议。驻南京地区部队各单位食堂由于改善了锅灶和做饭方法，去年上半年便节省烧煤六百多万斤。新疆军区所属汽车部队开展安全、节约、十万公里无大修运动，十个月节约的汽油、车胎、保养费等，折合现金可购买“解放牌”新卡车五十辆。有些驻海岛和边疆的部队还自己动手生产，减少国家的供应。
    由于军队热爱人民，人民群众无限地关怀自己的子弟兵。他们积极地为部队解决各种困难，协助部队守卫边防，架桥修路和运送物资。这对解放军胜利地完成巩固国防和战斗训练的任务起了很大的作用。
