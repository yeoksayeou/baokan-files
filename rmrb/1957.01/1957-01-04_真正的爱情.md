    True Love
    Ding Fang
    This true story took place in Liangshui Village, Luowei Township, Changshou County, Sichuan Province.
    In 1954, Guo Bingqing, a disabled soldier who had lost his sight, returned from the Korean front. His eyes, taken by a shell, could no longer see the new changes in his beloved hometown. He felt happy and excited when he learned about some of the changes in his hometown from his relatives' conversations.
    After he returned home, his fiancée saw that he was blind and used various excuses to politely reject his marriage proposal. With the persuasion and help of township cadres, she reluctantly agreed to marry him. However, after the marriage, they quarreled and fought every few days, and they divorced after only a few months. After the divorce, Guo Bingqing, unable to take care of himself and with limited mobility, repeatedly asked her to remarry, but she replied: "I will never serve you, a blind man, again." This brought great trauma to Guo Bingqing's heart. He became pessimistic, disappointed, and depressed... He no longer had that cheerful energy of the past.
    Many people in the village sympathized with him. At the end of a Youth League group meeting, a young female League member, Huang Guangrong, softly asked him:
    "How did you and Li Shuhui get divorced?"
    "My eyes are blind. Who would look up to a disabled person like me!"
    Huang Guangrong continued, "Even though you are disabled today, the Party and the people will not forget you, and many people will care about you." Usually, Huang Guangrong constantly comforted him, encouraged him, and helped him walk. She also asked Guo Bingqing to tell everyone stories about the battles on the Korean front. These warm care and memories of past combat life aroused Guo Bingqing's love for life and deepened their friendship, and she also fell in love with him from the bottom of her heart.
    This eighteen-year-old daughter of a poor peasant was originally a lonely person. Her mother died when she was two years old, and her father was also arrested by the Kuomintang. She started working from a young age, living a life of hunger and cold with her grandmother and uncle. A year before liberation, due to the pressure of life, her uncle had planned to send her to Guojia Temple to become a nun. The Communist Party came, and Huang Guangrong was liberated. Her father, who had been separated for many years, also returned home with the People's Liberation Army. From her own experience, she understood that today's happy life was exchanged for the bloodshed and sacrifice of revolutionary martyrs and many soldiers like Guo Bingqing. When I met her, she excitedly said to me: "The Communist Party saved me, the People's Army saved me, and isn't Guo Bingqing disabled for our sake? When I learned that Li Shuhui had abandoned him, I felt sorry for him and wanted to help him, but I was too shy to say it. One day, Guo Bingqing had his younger brother lead him to me, and he said to me, 'Are you willing to be a true friend to me?' I shyly agreed."
    Their love encountered many external obstacles in its development. Some people with backward thinking said: "She is looking at the disabled soldier because he has money. She even loves a blind man!" Some even said to her face: "You are young and skillful, why do you have to love a blind man? What future is there in marrying him?" She replied: "Because he is blind, he bled for us, that's why I love him. As for the future? Good production and building socialism, that's my future." She often went to Guo Bingqing's home to help with housework and engage in labor production. However, the Party and League leaders of the township, believing some people's rumors, regarded these legitimate behaviors as "illicit relationships between men and women." Not only did they not ask the township People's Committee to issue them a marriage certificate, but they also organized militiamen to monitor their actions. Huang Guangrong broke through all obstacles and threats, and insisted on her love for Guo Bingqing. She personally took Guo Bingqing's younger brother to the Changshou County People's Committee Civil Affairs Section to apply for marriage. The County Civil Affairs Section approved their marriage, which aroused the anger of some rural cadres. Party Branch Secretary Liu Boshou, Youth League Branch Secretary and Deputy Township Head Li Futing, Party Branch Organization Committee Member Xiang Yuntang, and others called the Civil Affairs Section several times to "protest," saying that the Civil Affairs Section was "developing adultery forces." They spread slanderous words everywhere, saying that Guo Bingqing was "dissatisfied with the Party and the government," "resisting the unified purchase and sale," and had "serious bourgeois ideas"; Huang Guangrong was a "class alien," "enjoying corruption, and engaging in chaotic love affairs." The Youth League Branch, with the above-mentioned charges, reported to the League Changshou County Committee for approval and gave Guo Bingqing the punishment of "probation within the League" and Huang Guangrong the punishment of "expulsion from the League." Huang Guangrong's father was also expelled from the agricultural cooperative. They also sued them to the County People's Procuratorate, demanding prosecution and "legal punishment."
    After Huang Guangrong recounted the course of this matter to me, I eagerly asked: "What happened later?" She said: "At that time, we were punished by the League, and we were mentally painful. However, I had a belief in my heart: 'Real gold is not afraid of fire,' and one day, the Party will clarify this matter. Finally, the Changshou County People's Committee, the CPC Changshou County Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, the Provincial Military Region and other units sent people to investigate! As a result, Liu Boshou and others' illegal and undisciplined acts of persecuting revolutionary disabled soldiers were punished as they deserved. I was selected to attend the National Congress of Active Elements of Revolutionary Martyrs' Families, Military Families, Disabled Soldiers, and Demobilized Soldiers." (Attached picture)

    真正的爱情
    丁舫
    这个真实的故事，发生在四川省长寿县罗围乡的凉水村里。
    1954年，双目失明的残废军人郭炳清从朝鲜前线归来，他那双被炮弹夺去的眼睛，再也看不见可爱故乡的新变化，当他从亲人的谈话中了解到故乡一些情况之后，他感到幸福、兴奋。
    他回到家后，他的未婚妻见他双眼瞎了，就用各种借口婉言拒绝他的结婚要求。在乡干部的说服帮助下，勉强同意和他结了婚。但是，结婚以后老是三天两头地吵嘴打架，不几个月也离了婚。离婚后，郭炳清因为无人照顾，行动不方便，曾数次向她提出复婚，她却回答说：“我再不侍候你这瞎眼人啦。”这给郭炳清同志在心灵上带来了极大的刺激，他悲观失望、消沉，……他再没有过去那股欢乐劲了。
    村里许多人都从心里同情他，在一次团的小组会快结束的时候，女青年团员黄广荣轻声的问他：
    “你是怎么和李淑辉离婚的？”
    “我的眼睛瞎了，谁还看得起我这残废人！”
    黄广荣接着说：“您今天残废了，党和人民不会忘记您，还有许多人会关心您的。”平时，黄广荣还不断安慰他，鼓励他，搀扶他走路；请郭炳清给大家讲朝鲜前线的战斗故事。这些温暖的照顾和往日战斗生活的回忆，激起了郭炳清对生活的热爱，加深了他俩的友情，而她也从内心里爱上了他。
    这个十八岁的贫农女儿，原是个孤苦伶仃的人，两岁死去了妈，父亲也被国民党抓走，她从小就开始劳动，跟祖母和伯父过着饥寒交迫的生活，解放前一年，因生活所迫，伯父曾准备把她送到郭家寺去当尼姑。共产党来了，黄广荣翻了身，离别多年的父亲也随解放军回家团圆了。她从切身的体验中懂得今天的幸福生活正是革命先烈以及许多像郭炳清这样的战士流血牺牲换来的。我遇见她时，她激动地对我说：“共产党救了我，人民军队救了我，郭炳清不正是为着我们残废了吗？当我知道李淑辉离弃了他的时候，我爱怜他，想去帮助他，当时就是害羞没有说出口，有一天，郭炳清让他的弟弟牵着找到我，他向我说，你愿意和我做一个真心朋友吗？我不好意思的答应了他。”
    他们的爱情在发展中受到了许多外来的阻力，有些思想落后的人说：“她是看残废军人有钱，一个瞎子也爱上啦！”甚至有的当面对她说：“你年纪青青，心灵手巧的，为啥偏要爱个瞎子，跟他结婚有啥前途呀？”她回答说：“就因为他是瞎子，他为我们流了血，我才爱他的，至于前途吗？好好生产，建设社会主义，就有我的前途。”她经常到郭炳清的家里帮助料理家务和从事劳动生产。但是该乡的党、团领导干部轻信了某些人的谣言，把这些正当的行为，认为是他俩“乱搞男女关系”，不仅不叫乡人民委员会发给他们结婚证明书，反而组织民兵监视他俩的行动。黄广荣冲破一切阻挠和威胁，坚持着对郭炳清的爱。他亲自同郭炳清的弟弟挽着他直接到长寿县人民委员会民政科申请结婚。县民政科批准他们结婚了，这又激起了部分乡村干部的恼怒。党支部书记刘伯寿、青年团总支书记兼副乡长李福廷、党支部组织委员向云堂等，一连几次打电话给民政科“抗议”，说民政科是“发展通奸势力”。他们到处散布污蔑言词，说郭炳清是“对党和政府不满”，“抵抗统购统销”，“资产阶级思想严重”；黄广荣是个“阶级异己分子”、“享乐腐化，乱搞恋爱”。青年团总支即以上述罪名，报团长寿县委批准，分别给予郭炳清“留团察看”和黄广荣“开除团籍”的处分。黄广荣的父亲也从农业社被开除了。又把他们控告到县人民检察院，要求起诉“法办”。
    黄广荣向我追述了这段事情的经过后，我急迫地问：“后来怎么样了呢？”她说：“当时我俩受到团的处分，在精神上是痛苦的，可是，我内心有个信念：‘真金不怕火烧’，总有一天，党会把这个事情弄清的。终于长寿县人民委员会、中共长寿县委监委会、四川省民政厅、省军区等单位派人来调查了！结果，刘伯寿等迫害革命残废军人的违法乱纪的行为，受到了应得的处分，我被选出席了全国烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人积极分子大会。”（附图片）
