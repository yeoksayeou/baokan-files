"Congratulations on the New Year" and "A Dream in the Garden"
     Su Fang

Everywhere is the crackling of firecrackers, everywhere are people exchanging "Congratulations on the New Year," everywhere is… The Spring Festival is announcing the good news of the approaching spring with its various noisy sounds. During this leisurely Spring Festival holiday, you will surely want to invite two or three friends to the entertainment venues to see programs with a heavier entertainment nature, then the movies "Congratulations on the New Year" and "A Dream in the Garden" will definitely suit your taste.

"Congratulations on the New Year" is quite similar in content to "Spring Festival Gala," which was shown last year, but it is slightly different in structure and subject matter. It briefly introduces the great achievements made by the motherland in the past year through the activities of various staff members (such as directors, photographers, sound engineers, etc.) of the Central Newsreel Film Studio, reflecting people's tense but pleasant life situation. What is of particular interest to the audience is that the film records many wonderful literary and artistic programs with a relatively large amount of space: here is the Huangmei Opera "Husband and Wife Watching Lanterns." The melodious singing, light and quick dance, and realistic expressions of the actors Yan Fengying and Wang Shaofang make the empty stage truly turn into a bustling market for watching lanterns during the Lantern Festival in an instant. Here is the Peking Opera "Jiang Gan Stealing the Book." The voice and figure of the eighty-year-old Mr. Xiao Changhua are still as good as they were in his prime, and he plays the character Jiang Gan vividly. Here is also Ma Lianliang's "Borrowing the East Wind," and Zhou Chuan's and Wang Chuansong's "Fifteen Strings of Cash" in the "Fortune Telling," all of which are rare masterpieces. In addition to these excellent opera programs, we can also see interesting crosstalk performances and song and dance performances such as "Playing the Dragon" and "Paying New Year's Greetings," which can attract the audience with their unique features. People rarely have the opportunity to see so many wonderful performances concentrated in one place on weekdays. But in the movie, they have all gathered together. This is indeed a feast for the eyes of the audience.

"A Dream in the Garden" is a new variety in movies – a crosstalk movie. In this film, you will not only be amused by the crosstalk performed by Hou Baolin and Guo Qiru, but you will also be amused by the comical behavior and strange encounters of the gardener played by Hou Baolin. A person goes to visit the Xijiao Zoo. His every move shows that he is a person who does not abide by public order and lacks social morality: he sneaks into the zoo without buying a ticket, and then throws fruit peels and food to the animals indiscriminately, and also lies on the chairs for tourists to rest on and sleeps soundly. He falls soundly asleep. In his dream, he still does not keep order, and therefore he is attacked by tigers, crocodiles, etc. Just as he shouted "Help," he woke up, it was just a dream! Although the film seems to show more of the animals' activities and less of the people's activities, and the background is quite monotonous, always a group of people laughing around the animals, laughing around the person who does not keep order, but its theme is good after all, and its subject matter and form also give people a novel and interesting feeling.

    “恭贺新禧”和“游园惊梦”
     苏方
    四处是噼呖啪啦的爆竹声，四处是人们互道“恭贺新禧”的祝贺声，四处是……春节正以它各式各样喧闹的声音宣告着春天即将到来的喜讯。在这闲暇的春节休假期中，你一定愿意邀上二三好友，到游艺场所去看看带有较重的娱乐性质的节目吧，那么电影“恭贺新禧”和“游园惊梦”也就一定会投合你的口味。
    “恭贺新禧”和去年放映过的“春节大联欢”内容颇相近似，但是在结构、取材上却又稍有不同。它是通过中央新闻纪录电影制片厂的各种工作人员（如导演、摄影师、录音师等）的活动来简要地介绍祖国一年来获得的巨大成就，反映人们紧张而又愉快的生活情形的。其中特别使观众感到兴趣的是影片以较多的篇幅纪录下来的许多精采的文艺节目：这里有黄梅戏“夫妻观灯”。演员严凤英和王少舫的悦耳的歌声，轻捷的舞蹈，逼真的表情，使得空荡荡的舞台在一瞬间真地变成了元宵观灯的闹市。这里是京剧“蒋干盗书”。八十多岁的萧长华老先生的嗓音、身段依旧不减当年，他把蒋干这个人物真是演得活灵活现了。这里还有马连良的“借东风”，还有周传瑛、王传淞的“十五贯”中的“测字”，总之都是不可多得的佳作。除了这些优秀的戏曲节目外，我们还可以从影片中看到有趣的相声表演和歌舞表演如“玩龙”、“小拜年”等，它们都能以其独特的风貌吸引观众。平日人们是少有机会一次集中看到这么多精采的表演的。而在影片里，它们却已荟萃一堂。这确是可以使观众一饱眼福了。
    “游园惊梦”是电影中的新品种——相声电影。在这部影片里面，你不仅会被侯宝林和郭启儒所表演的相声逗得哈哈大笑，你也会被侯宝林扮演的那个游园者的滑稽行径和奇怪的遭遇逗得大笑不止。有一个人去逛西郊动物园。他的一举一动，都说明他是一个不守公共秩序、缺乏社会道德的人：不买门票就混进了动物园，入园以后又满地乱扔果皮，乱抛食物给动物吃，而且还肆无忌惮地躺在让游客坐着休息的椅子上睡大觉。他酣然入梦了。在梦中他仍然不守秩序，而因此他受到了老虎、鳄鱼等的袭击。正在他高呼“救命”的时候，他惊醒了，原来是一场梦！影片虽然表现动物的活动似乎多了一些，而表现人的活动则嫌不足，而且背景也相当单调，老是一群人围着动物笑，围着那个不守秩序的人笑，但是它的主题思想毕竟是好的，而它的题材和形式，也给人新奇有趣的感觉。（附图片）
