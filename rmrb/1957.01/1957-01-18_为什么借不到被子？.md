    Why Can't We Borrow a Quilt?
    Luo Siding
    In the office of a certain township people's committee in Qingyuan County, Liaoning Province, a young woman walked in. She said shyly to the township head: "I don't want to be the group leader anymore, please replace me quickly!" The township head asked her why, and she replied simply: "There are no other reasons, but borrowing luggage for the work team is very difficult: whoever I ask to borrow a quilt from gets turned down; if I can't borrow one, or if the borrowed one isn't clean, the comrades in the work team are dissatisfied and say we don't care about the cadres...."
    This seems like a small matter, not worth discussing. Or some might think that this girl wants to "change shoulders" for such a small thing, which is really unnecessary. I don't want to offer any opinions on how to solve this problem, it makes me think of other things.
    I remember: just a few years ago, around the time of the land reform, in this same township, the lives of the peasants were much more difficult than they are today, and the number of cadres who came wasn't any less than today. Strangely enough, the peasants treated the cadres with such enthusiasm that I never heard of anyone not being able to borrow a quilt. On the contrary, today, when the lives of the peasants have improved somewhat, they can't even borrow a quilt.
    What is the reason? Apart from some real objective difficulties (such as some farmers not being wealthy enough to have more luggage; or the work team having too many people, etc.), I think we can also look for it in the cadres themselves. In the early days of liberation, we were all with the masses, sharing hardships and difficulties, and wholeheartedly serving the masses. The masses treated us as "family members." Not to mention borrowing a quilt, even if they were asked to do more things, they would be willing and go all out. However, in the past two years, some of us have begun to become detached from the masses, we don't go deep into reality, and we don't understand the hardships of the masses. There are also many people who come and go in a hurry, like dragonflies skimming over water, just touching the surface and then flying away. There are even some individuals who are used to living in the city, and when they arrive in the countryside, they are displeased with everything, complaining that the quilts are dirty and the food is unappetizing. In short, they are picky in every way. I ask, how can the peasants not become estranged from us, or even develop a kind of aversion? Even if someone has a spare quilt at home, they dare not or are unwilling to take it out. Is that really surprising?
    Maintaining the excellent tradition of our revolutionary cadres becoming one with the masses is by no means empty talk, it should be reflected in our every action. To truly achieve sharing the same fate and breathing the same air as the masses, we must and should earnestly start with many small things. In this sense, some peasants' unwillingness to lend quilts to certain cadres cannot really be considered a "small matter."

    为什么借不到被子？
    洛思丁
    辽宁省清原县某乡人民委员会办公室里，走进来一个年轻的姑娘，她很腼腆地向乡长说：“我不想当组长了，快换一换别人吧！”乡长问她为什么，她回答得很简单：“别的理由倒没有，就是给工作组借行李这件事很棘手：向谁借被谁都给钉子碰；借不着或借来不干净的被，工作组的同志又不满意，说我们不关心干部……。”
    这好像是一件小事，不值得一谈。或者有人会认为，这个姑娘为了一件小事想“换肩”，真没有必要。我不想就如何解决这个问题发表什么意见，它使我连想到的是一些别的东西。
    我想起：就在几年以前，土地改革前后，就在这个乡里，那时候农民的生活比今天要困难得多，来的干部也并不比今天少，奇怪得很，农民对待干部却是那样热情，以至从来没有听说过有借不着被的事。恰恰相反，在农民生活有了某些改善的今天，倒连一床被都借不着了。
    原因究竟在哪里呢？除开某些真实的客观困难以外（比如有些农民还不够富裕，没有更多的行李；或者是工作组人数太多等等），我觉得还可以从干部自己身上找。在解放初期我们都是和群众在一起同艰苦共患难的，一心一意为群众办事。群众把我们当成“家里人”。不说是借一床被，就是要他们作更多的事，他们也会心甘情愿，全力以赴的。可是，这两年来，我们之中的某些人，开始脱离群众了，他们不深入实际，不了解群众的疾苦。还有不少的人，来去匆匆，就像蜻蜓点水一样，刚沾着一个边，马上又飞走了。甚至有个别的人，过惯了城里的生活，一到农村，这也不顺眼，那也不顺眼，既嫌被子脏，又嫌饭菜不可口。总之，百般地挑剔。试问，农民怎么不和我们疏远，甚至产生一种反感呢？就是谁家里有多余的被子，他们不敢或不愿拿出来，难道这还值得奇怪吗？
    保持我们革命干部和群众打成一片的优良传统，这决不是一句空话，它应该体现在我们的每一个行动里面。真正做到和群众同命运共呼吸，就必须也应该认真地从许多小事做起。从这意义上说，有些农民不愿意借被子给某些干部，实在不能算是“小事”了。
