    A Century-Long Plan
    By Our Correspondent Li He
    World Peak
    If we were to place the science of all countries in the world today on a horizontal plane, then Soviet science would be a towering peak. The achievements of Soviet science, especially in mathematics, physics, and technical sciences, are recognized as enormous not only by the friends of the Soviet Union, but even by its enemies.
    Why has Soviet science been able to reach world-class levels in a period much shorter than that of capitalist countries? One key is the emphasis on cultivating scientific talent, on cultivating young scientific cadres, and on the quality of scientific workers. The number of Soviet scientific personnel has increased no less than twentyfold in less than forty years since the founding of the country, and there are now approximately 225,000 scientific research personnel, including nearly 10,000 doctors and nearly 80,000 associate doctors. These flowers are a sign of the prosperity of Soviet science and evidence of the Soviet Union's emphasis on cultivating scientific talent.
    In cultivating scientific talent, the Soviet Union has many advantages over capitalist countries. Academician Sisakyan, Academic Deputy Secretary of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, told reporters: The Soviet Union cultivates scientific cadres in all fields in a planned manner according to the needs of the country; it pays attention to the trends in the development of world science and cultivates cadres in the latest scientific departments; it provides scientific cadres with conditions to fully develop their creativity. He said, "Our task is to ensure that scientific cadres are not only proficient in their own specialty, but also able to apply materialist dialectics." His words are thought-provoking. Today, the Soviet scientific community criticizes certain past shortcomings of subjectivism and dogmatism, such as the universal promotion of Williams's grass-arable rotation system regardless of local conditions. It is wrong for anyone to doubt that scientific workers must study materialist dialectics. The enormous achievements of Soviet science today are inseparable from the universal education in Marxist-Leninist philosophy received by Soviet scientific cadres.
    World science is developing rapidly. In order to maintain the world-class level that has been achieved, it is necessary to ensure that one's own scientific workers are aware of the latest developments in science in various countries. Sisakyan said that the Soviet Academy of Sciences is now paying attention to this matter in three ways: more actively sending scientific workers to participate in international scientific conferences; more extensively translating and introducing foreign scientific and technological books; and strengthening the work of the Scientific Information Institute. The Scientific Information Institute, established in Moscow not long ago, collects 7,000 kinds of scientific journals from all over the world and provides brief reports on the latest works in all fields of science.
    Cultivating Youth
    Tirelessly cultivating young people is a guarantee that Soviet science can stand at the world level. The famous mathematician Academician Vinogradov repeatedly explained this principle to reporters. The reporter met him at the Institute of Mathematics. He has been the director of the Institute of Mathematics for twenty-five years. It can be said that the young people he has cultivated have already borne fruit, and the Vinogradov school has been formed.
    Vinogradov recalled the situation when he was ordered to organize the Institute of Mathematics in 1932. He said sincerely: "I did not look for many famous scientists, because I thought that although they were very knowledgeable, their policies were not very far-sighted. We selected mainly talented young people. Later, many of these young people became outstanding scientists."
    The Institute of Mathematics under his leadership enrolls twenty graduate students every year. They are selected from all over the Soviet Union and must have special mathematical talents and a desire to serve the people. By the time they obtain their degrees, some have shown not only mathematical knowledge, but also true mathematical talent. The institute retains three or four of the most outstanding, some of whom later grow into unique scientists. Vinogradov said: The emergence of such scientists is a great gain for the country, and it is the result of selecting talented young people and cultivating them for many years.
    How to select the young people needed? The experienced Vinogradov talked about two lessons. The first point: "If two university graduates take the exam at the same time and their scores are equally good, but one comes from a worker-peasant family and the other comes from an intellectual family, then the one from the worker-peasant family should be taken as a graduate student. This is not because of his good background, but because he has learned more than he has answered, and he usually does not fully express his talents in the exam." The second point: "Don't be misled by clever people, such as those who perform well in answering mathematical problem competitions. Those who are truly promising often look like mediocre and ordinary people." He said that the talents of Russians are not shown very early, sometimes they are shown when they are nearly thirty years old. Among his students, those who hold important positions today were "mediocre" rather than clever figures at the time.
    Professor Nikol, who participated in the conversation, supported Vinogradov's ideas. Nikol said: "Mathematics is similar to music. Many people know music, but to become a musician, one needs talent and talent." There are many students with excellent mathematics courses in Soviet universities, but the Institute of Mathematics still has to carefully select promising young people from thirty universities to cultivate, and send people to various universities every year to discover objects and encourage them to apply. Nikol used his own experience to illustrate that an effective way to cultivate young scientific workers is to create a scientific research environment. He used to study in a city in the outer provinces, liked mathematics, but it was not yet scientific research. Later, mathematicians came. He said: "This is like a snowball, sticking the surrounding snowflakes together." He quickly joined the mathematical research work. He believes that forming a scientific research environment with cities, universities, and scientists as the center is a major event that cannot be ignored.
    Improving Quality
    It is precisely because of the attention paid to cultivating young people that many capable young scientific workers can be seen in atomic power stations and other Soviet scientific research institutions. Despite this, the Soviet scientific community is still striving to cultivate more young scientific talents, and regards training a strong scientific force as one of the important tasks at present. However, as many scientists have stated, the issue of cultivating scientific cadres is not only about quantity, but more importantly about quality. The Soviet Party and government have recently taken measures to improve the quality of scientific cadres. These measures require scientific workers to regard obtaining a degree as the beginning rather than the end of scientific research, and require those who take the degree to combine theory with practice rather than separate from practice.
    Recently, I met a university graduate who had been admitted as a graduate student after a rigorous examination, but was unqualified because he had not done practical work. According to the new regulations, only those who have more than two years of practical work experience in a certain major can be considered for graduate studies in that major. Only those institutions of higher learning and scientific institutions that can provide good theoretical guidance and necessary experiments can open graduate departments. The original doctoral system did not meet the strict requirements of quality, so it was abolished. In the future, only those who have achieved success in scientific research can take the doctoral degree. Those who take the associate doctorate must come up with new scientific conclusions and suggestions; those who take the doctorate must contribute to theoretical generalization and solving new scientific problems.
    The review of degree theses has also become much stricter. Not long ago, the Soviet Communist Party History Review Committee under the All-Soviet Supreme Degree Appraisal Committee reviewed 100 theses and only approved 18. According to the new regulations, if the academic committee of an institution of higher learning approves an unqualified degree thesis, the Supreme Appraisal Committee will deprive it of the power to accept degree theses for a period of time.
    Treating Equally
    While sparing no effort to cultivate scientific talent, the Soviet Union also treats scientific talent from people's democratic countries studying in the Soviet Union equally. Now Soviet scientific research institutions and institutions of higher learning are training hundreds of graduate students and advanced students for our country. In almost every scientific department, you can meet our country's future scientific cadres studying under the guidance of outstanding experts in the Soviet Union.
    Hydraulic expert Professor Menker was very happy to tell reporters that the seven Chinese young scientific workers he had trained have now been assigned to the posts needed by the motherland. Professor Menker visited our country last year and met his students. He said: "These were once our excellent graduate students. Naturally, they were sent to study abroad not long after the birth of New China, so their basic knowledge was worse than that of our graduate students. But they worked very hard, so their results were still very good." Menker and others who are responsible for training China's future scientific cadres never mentioned the difficulties brought to them by the knowledge base and Russian language level of our graduate students, nor did they mention their own indelible contributions to guiding their studies. Their internationalist spirit and humble attitude will always remain in people's memories.
    Several graduate students from our country studying at the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy recently told reporters about the tireless sense of responsibility and enthusiasm of the Soviet professors who guided them, which enabled them not only to learn specialized knowledge, but also to learn the attitude towards science.
    There are four Chinese graduate students in the Department of Plant Pathology. Dr. Dunning, the director of the department, considering that China needs scientific talents in many fields, suggested that they each study one aspect. One of the graduate students, Hu Jicheng, is from Northeast China. In order to make the thesis topic as closely related to China's needs as possible, Dunning encouraged him to study the viruses and bacteria of soybeans, because Chinese soybeans are famous in the world. Once, Dunning led Hu Jicheng to the experimental field, pointed to a piece of land and asked him whose it was and what experiment was being done. He could not answer. The professor patted him on the shoulder and said: "You should broaden your horizons and not just see your own soybeans. You should know the research work of all the graduate students and assistants in the entire teaching and research section." The professor asked the Soviet graduate students to introduce the situation of their experimental fields to Hu Jicheng. This criticism made Hu Jicheng realize that he should not limit his vision to the research under his nose. Another time, Hu Jicheng could not find aphids in his soybean experimental field, and he did not get any results after receiving soybean virus seeds three times. He expressed a little impatience when Dunning came to check the experiment. The professor taught him: "We are doing scientific experiments, understand? It is good to get a little result after ten scientific experiments. Be patient and meticulous!" This criticism made Hu Jicheng realize that scientific research should not be afraid of failure, and should make persistent efforts.
    Dr. Qizhefsky, director of the Department of Cultivation, is a disciple of Williams, but he is studying for graduate student Liu Gengnan the most acute topic in the Soviet Union: the comparison of Maltsev's and Williams' cultivation methods. Every time Qizhefsky finished lecturing on the rotation chapter of agronomy, he always introduced to the students the process of his own ideological criticism. He said: Comrade Khrushchev once criticized him at a meeting for blindly promoting Williams' grass-arable rotation system and wrongly planting perennial pasture in Ukraine with a similar wheat yield. He could not accept it. After the meeting, Comrade Khrushchev spoke to him individually and cited many facts. He came back and reopened Williams' theoretical research, only to realize that Williams had correctly divided crops into several categories according to the amount of water needed, but Williams himself and his disciples mistakenly concluded that perennial pasture should be planted throughout the Soviet Union. Why? It turned out that Williams was studying the grass-arable rotation system in the non-black soil area with more water and suitable for planting perennial pasture, proving that planting pasture did improve soil fertility. This rotation system played a huge role in the non-black soil area, but it was wrong to move it to Ukraine, which did not have much rain. Qizhefsky's spirit of self-criticism and responsible attitude of criticizing dogmatism through his own experience gave Soviet students and Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union a profound education.

    百年大计
    本报记者　李何
    世界高峰
    如果把今天世界各国的科学并列在一个地平线上，那么，苏联的科学是一座巍然矗立的高峰。苏联科学，特别是数学、物理学、技术科学等的成就，不单苏联的朋友，甚至苏联的敌人都承认是巨大的。
    苏联科学为什么能够在比较资本主义国家短促得多的期间内达到世界水平呢？其中一个关键就是重视培养科学人才，重视培养青年科学干部，重视科学工作人员的质量。苏联科学人才在建国不到四十年中增长了不下二十倍，现有约二十二万五千名科学研究人员，包括将近一万名博士和将近八万名副博士。这些花朵，是苏联科学繁荣的标志，也是苏联重视培养科学人材的证据。
    在培养科学人才上，苏联有许多优越于资本主义国家的特点。苏联科学院学术副秘书西沙江院士对记者说：苏联根据国家的需要，有计划地培养各方面的科学干部；注意世界科学发展的趋向而培养最新科学部门的干部；给科学干部以充分发挥创造性的条件。他说：“我们的任务是要科学干部不仅要精通本门专业，而且要会运用唯物主义辩证法。”他的话值得人寻味。今天，苏联科学界批评过去某些主观主义、教条主义的缺点，如像不顾地方条件，普遍推行威廉斯的草田轮作制。如果有人对科学工作者必须学习唯物主义辩证法发生怀疑，那是不对的。苏联今天科学的巨大成就，是和苏联科学干部普遍受过马克思列宁主义哲学的教育分不开的。
    世界科学在一日千里地发展。为了保持已达到的世界水平，必须使自己的科学工作者知道各国科学发展的最新情况。西沙江说，苏联科学院如今从三个方面注意这件事：更积极地派遣科学工作者参加国际科学会议；更广泛地翻译和介绍外国科学技术书籍；加强科学情报研究所的工作。不久以前在莫斯科建立的科学情报研究所，收罗有七千种世界各国科学期刊，对世界各门科学的最新作品都加以简要的报道。
    培植青年
    不倦地培植年青人，是苏联科学能够站在世界水平上的保证。著名的数学家维诺格拉多夫院士向记者反复说明这个道理。记者是在数学研究所见他的。他当数学研究所所长已经二十五年。他培植的青年可以说是已经桃李成荫了，而且已经形成了维诺格拉多夫学派。
    维诺格拉多夫回忆在1932年受命组织数学研究所时候的情形，他诚恳地说：“我没有找多少著名的科学家，因为我认为，虽然他们很博学，但是他们的方针不是很有远见的。我们挑选了主要是有才干的青年。后来，这些青年中许多人都成为出色的科学家了。”
    他所领导的数学研究所每年收取二十名研究生。他们是从全苏联挑选出来的，必须有数学的特长和为人民服务的志愿。在他们考取学位的时候，有些人已经表现出不仅有数学知识，而且有真正的数学才能。研究所留下三、四个最优秀的，其中有的后来成长为独树一帜的科学家。维诺格拉多夫说：出现这样的科学家，是国家的巨大收获，这是挑选有才干的青年并加以多年培植的结果。
    怎样挑选所需要的青年呢？经验丰富的维诺格拉多夫谈了两点体会。第一点：“如果有两个大学毕业生同时应考，成绩一样好，但一个出身于工农家庭，另一个出身于知识分子家庭，那么应该取工农家庭出身的为研究生。这不是因为他的成分好，而是因为他学过的东西比答出的东西多，通常他在考试时候没有完全表露出自己的才干。”第二点：“不要被小聪明的人，如像在回答数学问题比赛会上表现敏捷的人所迷惑。真正有作为的人，常常看起来是中等的平凡的人。”他说，俄罗斯人的才干不是很早就表现出来的，有时将近三十岁时候才表现出来。在他的门生中，今天担负重要职务的，是当时“中等”的而不是伶俐的人物。
    参加谈话的尼科尔教授，支持了维诺格拉多夫的思想。尼科尔说：“数学类似音乐，很多人会音乐，但要成为音乐家需要有天资和才干。”苏联各大学有许多数学功课优异的学生，但数学研究所还得用心从三十个大学挑选有希望的青年来培植，每年派人到各个大学发现对象和鼓励他们投考。尼科尔以自己的经历说明，培植青年科学工作者的一个有效方法是创立科学研究环境。他从前在外省一个城市学习，喜欢数学，但还谈不上科学研究。后来来了数学家。他说：“这像一个雪球，把周围的雪片粘起来。”他很快就参加了数学研究工作。他认为，以城市、学府、科学家作中心而形成科学研究环境，是不可忽视的大事。
    提高质量
    正是由于注意培养青年，在原子能发电站和其他苏联科学研究机关都可以见到许多能干的青年科学工作者。尽管这样，苏联科学界还是努力培养更多的青年科学人才，把训练雄厚的科学生力军当作当前重要任务之一。然而，如像许多科学家所表示的，培养科学干部的问题不仅仅在于数量，更要紧的是质量。苏联党和政府最近采取了提高科学干部质量的措施。这些措施一方面要求科学工作人员把取得学位看作从事科学研究的开始而不是完毕，另一方面要求考取学位的人们必须使理论结合实际而不是脱离实际。
    最近碰见一位大学毕业生，他经过严格的考试，已经被录取为研究生了，但是因为没有做过实际工作而不合格。根据新的规定，要对某一专业有两年以上实际工作经验的人，才可以考作这一专业的研究生。只有那些能够作好理论指导和必要的实验的高等学校和科学机关，才可以开设研究生部。原有的博士生制度不合质量的严格要求，所以取消了。今后只有科学研究有成就的人，才可以考取博士学位。考副博士的人，要拿出新的科学结论和建议；考博士的人，要在理论概括和解决新的科学问题上有贡献。
    对学位论文的审查也严格得多了。不久以前，全苏学位最高评议委员会所属的苏共党史审查委员会审阅了一百篇论文，只批准了十八篇。根据新的规定，如果高等学校的学术委员会通过了不够格的学位论文，最高评议委员会将剥夺它在一个时期内接受学位论文的权力。
    一视同仁
    苏联不遗余力地培养科学人才，同时，一视同仁地培养着人民民主国家在苏联留学的科学人才。现在苏联科学研究机关和高等学校为我国培养的研究生和进修生数以百计。几乎在每一个科学部门都可以遇见在苏联出色的专家指导下学习的我国未来的科学干部。
    水利专家孟克尔教授很高兴地告诉记者，他所培养的七个中国青年科学工作者，现在都已经被分配到祖国所需要的岗位上去了。孟克尔教授去年访问我国的时候见到了自己的学生。他说：“这些曾经是我们的优秀的研究生。自然，他们在新中国诞生不久被派出来留学，所以基础知识比我们的研究生差些。可是他们很用功，所以成绩还是很好。”孟克尔和其他负责培养中国未来科学干部的人们，从来不提我国研究生知识基础和俄文水平给他们带来的困难，也不提自己指导学习的不可磨灭的功绩。他们这种国际主义精神和谦虚态度永远留在人们的记忆里。
    在季米里雅节夫农业学院学习的我国几位研究生，最近向记者谈了指导他们的苏联教授那种诲人不倦的责任感和热心，使他们不仅学到专门学问，而且学到了对待科学的态度。
    植物病理教研室有四个中国研究生。教研室主任杜宁博士考虑到中国需要多方面的科学人才，建议他们各学一个方面。其中一个研究生胡吉成是从我国东北来的。杜宁为了使论文题目尽可能结合中国的需要，鼓励他研究大豆的病毒和细菌，因为中国的大豆在世界是有名的。有一次，杜宁带领胡吉成到实验地去，指着一块地问他那是谁的，做的是什么实验。他答不出来。教授拍着他的肩膀说：“眼界要放广，不要光看见自己的大豆。全教研室的研究生和助教的研究工作，都应该知道。”教授让苏联研究生把他们的实验地的情形都向胡吉成介绍一遍。这次批评使胡吉成猛省到不要把眼光局限在鼻子尖下的研究里。又有一次，胡吉成在自己的大豆实验地上没有找到蚜虫，接了三次大豆病毒种也没有结果，他在杜宁来检查实验时表示一点不耐烦。教授教诲他说：“我们做的是科学实验，懂得吗？科学实验做上十次能取得一点点结果，就算好了。要耐心，要细致！”这次批评使胡吉成认识到做科学研究要不怕失败，要再接再厉。
    耕作教研室主任齐热甫斯基博士是威廉斯的弟子，但他给研究生刘更男研究的却是目前在苏联最尖锐的题目：马尔采夫和威廉斯耕作方法的比较。齐热甫斯基每次讲完耕作学的轮作一章以后，总向学生介绍自己思想批判的经过。他说：赫鲁晓夫同志曾经在会议上批评他领头盲目地推广威廉斯的草田轮作制，在乌克兰错种了和小麦产量差不多的多年生牧草。他不能接受。会后，赫鲁晓夫同志又找他个别谈话，列举了许多事实。他回来才又翻开威廉斯的理论研究，才知道威廉斯曾经正确地把作物按所需水分的多寡分成若干类，但威廉斯自己和他的弟子却错误地得出在全苏联种多年生牧草的结论。为什么呢？原来威廉斯是在水分比较多的、适合种多年生牧草的非黑土地带研究草田轮作制，证明种牧草后确实提高了土地肥沃性。这种轮作制在非黑土地带起了巨大的作用，但搬用到雨水不多的乌克兰却错了。齐热甫斯基的自我批评精神和现身说法地批判教条主义的负责态度，给了苏联学生和我国留学生深刻的教育。
