(Comprehensive news report) The metalworkers' strike in Schleswig-Holstein, West Germany, which began on October 24th of last year, has persisted for nearly eleven weeks. The scale of the strike has now expanded from 32,000 workers in thirty-two shipyards, metal industry factories, and electrical equipment factories to more than 34,000 workers in thirty-seven factories.

The strike was triggered by the employers' refusal to meet the workers' demands for continued wage payments during illness and vacation, increased vacation time, and the right to freedom of action for the union.

These demands of the metalworkers are reasonable. In 1955, the sales volume of the metal processing industry in Schleswig-Holstein increased threefold compared to 1950, and productivity increased by 81.4%. The sales volume of the shipbuilding industry increased fourfold, and productivity increased by 100%. However, the proportion of labor wages in sales revenue decreased from 23.4% to 18.9% during the same period. In the shipbuilding industry, the proportion of wages even decreased by 26.1%. This severe exploitation has aroused the dissatisfaction of the workers.

During the metalworkers' strike, the capitalists used all kinds of conspiracies and tricks to sabotage the strike, but all failed. Therefore, they asked the state government Premier Hassel to come forward to mediate and arbitrate. However, the arbitration committee's arbitration decision made at the end of last year ignored the main demands of the striking workers. Therefore, in a secret ballot held on January 7th, the workers rejected the arbitration decision and decided to continue the strike.

According to West German newspapers, the West German government has been constantly interfering since the strike began last year. The Bonn treasury has issued 35 million marks in subsidies to factory owners. After the failure of the arbitration, Bonn began frequent activities, attempting to stifle the strike struggle by means of "government coercion." Adenauer also announced that he would interfere with the strike.

However, the metalworkers' strike has received enthusiastic support from trade unions and workers all over West Germany. Many trade unions and workers have launched donations to help the striking workers with their lives, and motorcades carrying goods for the striking workers have been arriving from many cities in West Germany. At the same time, the working class of East Germany has also given tremendous support to the striking workers.

The Schleswig-Holstein metalworkers' strike has dealt the employers the heaviest blow since 1945. It costs employers 2.2 million marks per week (not including lost profits). All shipyards in the state have been unable to accept orders. Power generation in the port of Kiel and its suburbs has been reduced by a third. The production of milled iron at the Lübeck ironworks has come to a standstill, forcing many small factories and workshops to shut down.

### 西德五金工人罢工扩大

    西德五金工人罢工扩大
    本报综合消息　去年10月24日开始的西德石勒苏益格—荷尔斯泰因州的五金工人大罢工，已经坚持了将近十一个星期。现在罢工的规模已由原来的三十二个造船厂、五金工业工厂和电气器材工厂的三万二千个工人，扩大为三十七家工厂和三万四千多个工人。
    这次罢工是由于资方拒绝工人提出的在患病和休假期间照发工资、增加休假期限和工会享有行动自由权利的要求所引起的。
    五金工人提出的这些要求是合理的。1955年石勒苏益格—荷尔斯泰因五金加工工业的销售量比1950年增加了三倍，生产率提高了81.4％；造船工业的销售量增加了四倍，生产率提高了100％。但同期工人工资在销售量上所占的成分却从23.4％降低到18.9％。在造船业里工资比例成分甚至降低了26.1％。这种严重的剥削引起了工人的不满。
    在五金工人罢工期间，资本家们曾经使用了种种的阴谋诡计来破坏罢工，结果都失败了。于是他们请州政府总理哈塞尔来出面调停，进行仲裁。但是这个仲裁委员会在去年年底作出的仲裁决定，无视罢工工人的主要要求，因此工人们在1月7日举行的秘密投票中，否决了这项仲裁决定，并决定继续罢工。
    据西德报纸透露，从去年罢工开始以来，西德政府曾经不断进行干涉。波恩国库已发给工厂企业主们三千五百万马克的补助金。在仲裁失败之后，波恩方面更开始了频繁的活动，企图以“政府强制”手段来扼杀罢工斗争。阿登纳并且宣布，他将对罢工进行干涉。
    但是，五金工人的罢工得到西德各地的工会和工人们的热情支持。许多工会和工人纷纷发起捐献来帮助罢工工人的生活，载着送给罢工工人的物品的汽车队源源从西德许多城市来到罢工地区。同时民主德国的工人阶级也给了罢工工人巨大的支持。
    石勒苏益格—荷尔斯泰因州五金工人的罢工给了企业主们自1945年以来最沉重的打击。它使企业主每周损失二百二十万马克（利润损失还不包括在内）。这个州的所有造船厂已经无法接受订货。基尔港和郊区的发电量减少了三分之一。卢卑克炼铁厂的铣铁生产已告停顿，使许多小工厂和作坊不能不停工。
