    Boldly Use, Concretely Help, Fully Care
    Tongjialiang Coal Mine Properly Resettles Demobilized Soldiers

    (Our dispatch) Since the demobilized construction soldiers were placed at the Tongjialiang Mine of Datong Coal Mine, before 1956, due to the lack of help and care from the leadership, many of them were not settled in their jobs and did not play their due role.

    After the Tongjialiang Mine Party Committee discovered this situation and corrected it, the enthusiasm of the demobilized construction soldiers was greatly brought into play. In 1956, the Party Committee conducted two inspections of the resettlement work of demobilized soldiers and summarized two experiences: one is that they should be trained and educated according to their characteristics, used correctly, and strengthen their political and ideological leadership; the other is to enthusiastically and promptly help them solve difficulties. Then, extensive education was carried out among the workers, criticizing the one-sided views and cold attitude towards the demobilized construction soldiers, and a system was established for cadres to talk with the demobilized construction soldiers, solicit their opinions, and understand their requirements. Because they lacked technical and professional knowledge, it was very difficult for them to work, so they were organized to learn technology from the old workers. In terms of welfare, 83 cases of unreasonable wages were resolved for them last year. Through learning technology, dozens of demobilized soldiers were promoted. Fifteen people who were improperly placed in their jobs and could not persist in heavy physical labor were transferred to lighter jobs. Thirty-three houses were added for those with housing difficulties, and a total of 980 yuan was subsidized for those who were really in financial difficulties. After taking these measures, the demobilized construction soldiers were happy and worked more actively.

    According to the results of the Tongjialiang Mine Party Committee's recent inspection, after training and education, 35 demobilized construction soldiers have been promoted to leadership positions, some of whom have become engineers, some have become party branch secretaries, and some have become section chiefs. In addition, 77 coal mining technicians and electromechanical technicians have been trained, and many people have learned to operate various machines; and 18 people have been rated as advanced producers. After the drilling worker Wang Zhaoan in the infrastructure construction area signed a master-apprentice contract with the old worker Mu Sinu, he humbly learned from Master Mu. In less than half a year, he learned the drilling technology and was promoted from a third-grade worker to a fifth-grade worker. Zhang Deyi, from the coal mining section, was affected in his work enthusiasm because his marriage problem had not been solved, and he was often absent from work. The party branch sent someone to talk to him, encouraged him to work hard, and assisted him in solving his marriage problem. Although it has not been resolved yet, he feels very satisfied and believes that the leadership cares about him very much. He is not only no longer absent from work, but also very active in his work.

    大胆使用　具体帮助　充分关怀
    同家梁煤矿妥善安置复员军人
    本报讯　被安置在大同煤矿同家梁矿工作的复员建设军人，在1956年以前，由于领导上对他们帮助和关怀不够，一度有不少人不安心工作，没有发挥他们应有的作用。
    同家梁矿分党委发现这种情况并加以纠正以后，大大发挥了复员建设军人的积极性。分党委在1956年曾两次对安置复员军人的工作进行了检查，总结出两条经验：一条是应当根据他们的特点，进行培养教育，正确地使用他们，加强对他们的政治思想领导；一条是热情地及时地帮助他们解决困难。接着，在职工中进行了广泛的教育，批判了对复员建设军人的片面看法和冷淡态度，建立了干部同复员建设军人谈话的制度，征求他们的意见，了解他们的要求。由于他们缺乏技术和业务知识，工作起来十分困难，便组织他们向老工人学习技术。在生活福利方面，在去年一年内帮助他们解决了工资不合理的问题八十三件。通过学习技术，数十名复员军人升了级。对工作安置不当，不能坚持重体力劳动的十五人，给调换了较轻的工作，又给居住困难的人添了三十三间房屋，对生活确实困难的人共补助了九百八十元。采取这些措施以后，复员建设军人心情愉快了，工作更加积极起来。
    据不久以前同家梁矿分党委检查结果，经过培养教育，复员建设军人中已有三十五名被提拔起来担任了领导职务，其中有的当了工程师，有的当了党支部书记，有的当了段长，另外培养出了采煤技术工人和机电技术工人七十七名，许多人学会了操纵各种机器；并有十八名被评为先进生产者。基建工程区打眼工王兆安同老工人穆四女签订了师徒合同以后，虚心向穆师傅学习，不到半年时间，就学会了打眼技术，由三级工升为五级工。采煤段张德义，因为婚姻问题没有解决，工作积极性受到影响，时有缺勤现象，党支部派人找他谈话，鼓励他好好工作，协助他解决婚姻问题，虽然目前还没有解决，但他感到很满意，认为领导上对他十分关切，不但再不缺勤了，工作还非常积极。
