    As humanity stepped into 1957, encouraging news arrived one after another: Socialist countries are making new efforts to strengthen their mutual solidarity and cooperation, and have already achieved new and significant successes. At the invitation of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government and the leading organs of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties and Governments of Bulgaria, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia held a four-day meeting in Budapest at the beginning of this year. The Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic concluded government talks in Moscow on the 7th and issued a joint statement. At the same time, the Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai has arrived in Moscow for a friendly visit at the invitation of the Soviet government, and will then pay a friendly visit to Poland at the invitation of the Polish government. All these talks and visits mark the continuous consolidation and development of the friendly unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    The meeting of the party and government representatives of Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia is a major support for the Hungarian revolutionary cause. This meeting was held at a time when the situation in Hungary was becoming increasingly normal and stable. Despite facing numerous difficulties, the efforts of the Hungarian revolutionary forces have gained increasingly strong support from the workers and peasants, and the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government is increasingly consolidating its control over the national situation. The remnants of domestic counter-revolutionary forces are gradually being eliminated. The organization of the party, the Socialist Workers' Party, as the leading force of the proletarian dictatorship, has been rapidly established in the capital and throughout the country. The working people and democratic forces, led by the working class, are fighting to heal the wounds and revive the country's political and economic life. The statement issued by the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government on January 6 regarding the most important tasks facing Hungary is a sign that the domestic situation in Hungary is fundamentally improving.

    Undeniably, Hungary still faces many serious difficulties today. Due to the stagnation and destruction of production during the counter-revolutionary riots, the national economy has suffered significant losses. For a considerable period, the lack of fuel, power, and raw materials will affect the normal operation of Hungarian industrial production and other adverse economic consequences. Another fact that cannot be ignored is that although the attempt to subvert the Hungarian People's Democratic system and interfere in its internal affairs has failed, the imperialists are still eyeing Hungary's independence and threatening its security. To overcome these difficulties and consolidate its independence, international assistance is needed in addition to the efforts of the Hungarian people themselves. Therefore, the unanimous support of the socialist countries for Hungary, as expressed in the five-nation meeting, is of great significance. The communique of the five-nation meeting pointed out that the representatives of Bulgaria, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia "assured the Hungarian comrades that the people of their countries will fully support and assist the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party in strengthening the People's Democratic state and ensuring the independence and security of the country against the conspiracies of the imperialist aggressive forces." Our people also hold the same attitude towards the Hungarian people and the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government as the people of Bulgaria, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia. The just actions of the Soviet army and the full support of Bulgaria, Romania, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other socialist countries for Hungary are a true reflection of the close and brotherly relationship between socialist countries in times of difficulty. With the efforts of the entire Hungarian people and the firm support and assistance of the socialist countries, the temporary economic difficulties in Hungary can be gradually overcome, the Hungarian socialist construction cause will surely make new progress, and the imperialist attempt to subvert the Hungarian People's Democratic system is even more hopeless.

    Immediately following the five-nation meeting of Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia, the Soviet government delegation held talks with the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic. In the joint Soviet-German statement issued, the two countries reaffirmed their determination to further develop Soviet-German friendly cooperation and stipulated some important measures for this purpose. The two countries will conclude an agreement on the legal status of Soviet troops stationed in the German Democratic Republic in the near future. The Soviet Union has decided to expand its supply of goods to the German Democratic Republic in 1957 and will lend the German Democratic Republic 340 million rubles in free foreign exchange to help the German Democratic Republic smoothly develop its national economy. These facts, as well as the fact that the Soviet Union has repeatedly reduced or completely exempted the German Democratic Republic from its reparations obligations to the Soviet Union and provided the German Democratic Republic with a large amount of economic assistance, all illustrate that the Soviet Union is a truly selfless and reliable friend of the people of the German Democratic Republic.

    The results of the Soviet-German talks are of great significance for strengthening the sovereign independence and international position of the first worker-peasant state in German history—the German Democratic Republic. It once again reminds those who ignore reality to pay attention: to solve the German question, it is necessary to first recognize the rights enjoyed by the German Democratic Republic as a sovereign state, and it must be realized through consultations among the Germans themselves.

    The five-nation meeting of Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia and the Soviet-German talks are new developments in the relations between socialist countries after the Soviet-Polish and Soviet-Romanian talks. In addition, the Communist and Workers' Parties of various European socialist countries have also held many bilateral talks separately. All these talks show that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is continuing to hold high the banner of proletarian internationalism and is making great efforts to continuously enhance the unity and cooperation of socialist countries. Although some problems and shortcomings have occurred in the relations of some socialist countries in the past, this has not and cannot create insurmountable contradictions between them. Because socialist countries have a common ideological foundation of Marxism-Leninism and have a common goal of safeguarding peace and promoting the cause of human progress. The people of socialist countries and their working-class parties, based on the long-term historical experience and lessons of class struggle, understand the irrefutable truth that unity is strength. Therefore, they regard the continuous consolidation and strengthening of the solidarity between socialist countries as one of their highest international obligations. Precisely because of this, any problems in the relations between socialist countries can be resolved satisfactorily through sincere consultation and comradely discussion on the basis of complete equality, respect for independent sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs. And as long as this is done, the relations between socialist countries will be healthier and more consolidated, and the unity will be further enhanced, thereby creating more favorable conditions for further developing the economic culture of these countries through mutual assistance and for safeguarding the cause of peace. People have seen that in the recent period the propaganda machine of imperialism has been vigorously provoking friendly relations between socialist countries. But the cause of socialism never develops according to the logic and wishes of the imperialists. The solidarity between socialist countries will not only not be weakened, but will only be further consolidated and strengthened. There is no doubt that the ongoing Sino-Soviet talks and the upcoming Sino-Polish talks will make new and significant contributions to consolidating and strengthening the solidarity between socialist countries.

    The five-nation meeting communique and the joint Soviet-German statement also noted the fact that the recent international situation is tending to be tense again. Due to the armed aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel, and due to the US imperialism's stepped-up subversive and destructive activities against European People's Democratic countries, especially due to the US ruling group's formulation of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and its new shameless offensive against the people of the Middle East and Near East, the international situation has encountered new obstacles on the road to detente. After reaffirming the peaceful policies of the socialist countries, the five-nation meeting communique stated that "they are fully determined to use the strength of the socialist system and their influence to smash the attempts of aggressive blocs to further intensify the international situation, step up the arms race, and incite war hysteria." We firmly support this determination expressed in the five-nation meeting communique. Imperialism's policy of colonial expansion and its offensive against the world socialist forces will never strengthen imperialism's position, but will only deepen its contradictions with the people of the world and the contradictions within the imperialist bloc, and can only be resolutely countered by all patriotic forces in Asia and Africa, all peace forces in the world, and socialist forces. Conversely, the socialist countries' efforts to consolidate and develop mutual solidarity and cooperation will bring important results and further strengthen their strength. This unbreakable friendship and unity of socialist countries is an important guarantee for defeating all imperialist conspiracies and promoting the advancement of human progress.

### 社会主义各国的团结在不断加强

    社会主义各国的团结在不断加强
    当人类刚刚跨进1957年的时候，接连传来了鼓舞人心的消息：社会主义各国正在为加强相互之间的团结合作进行新的努力，并且已经取得了新的重大成就。保加利亚、罗马尼亚、苏联和捷克斯洛伐克的共产党、工人党和政府的代表们，应匈牙利工农革命政府和匈牙利社会主义工人党领导机关的邀请，于今年初在布达佩斯举行了为时四天的会谈。苏联同德意志民主共和国7日在莫斯科结束了政府会谈，并且发表了联合声明。同时，以周恩来总理为首的我国政府代表团应苏联政府的邀请已抵达莫斯科进行友好访问，并将接着应波兰政府的邀请对波兰进行友好访问。所有这些会谈和访问，标志着以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国友好团结是在不断地巩固和发展中。
    保、匈、罗、苏、捷五国党和政府代表的会谈，是对匈牙利革命事业的重大支持。这次会谈是在匈牙利国内情况日趋正常和稳定的情况下举行的。匈牙利革命力量尽管面临着重重困难，但是它的努力已经获得工农群众愈来愈有力的支持，工农革命政府正在日益巩固地控制着全国的局势，国内反革命势力的残余正在被逐渐肃清。作为无产阶级专政的领导力量的党——社会主义工人党的组织已在首都和全国各地迅速建立起来。以工人阶级为首的劳动人民和民主力量，正在为医治创伤、复兴国家的政治经济生活而斗争。1月6日匈牙利工农革命政府就匈牙利当前最重要的任务发表的声明，就是匈牙利国内情况根本趋向好转的标志。
    不可否认，匈牙利今天还存在着许多严重困难。由于反革命暴乱期间生产的停顿和破坏，国家经济遭到重大的损失。在一个不很短的时期内，燃料、动力和原料的缺乏，将会影响匈牙利工业生产的正常进行和其他一些不利的经济后果。另一个不容忽视的事实是，虽然企图颠复匈牙利人民民主制度和干涉它的内政的阴谋已经宣告失败，但是帝国主义者仍在虎视眈眈地觊觎着匈牙利的独立，威胁着它的安全。为了克服这些困难，巩固自己的独立，除了匈牙利人民自己的努力以外，还需要国际的援助。因此，在五国会谈中所表明的社会主义国家对于匈牙利的一致支持就具有重要的意义。五国会谈的公报指出，保、罗、苏、捷的代表们“向匈牙利同志保证，他们国家的人民将全力支持和援助匈牙利工农革命政府和匈牙利社会主义工人党来加强人民民主国家，保证这个国家的独立和安全，以防备帝国主义侵略势力的阴谋”。我国人民对于匈牙利人民和匈牙利工农革命政府，也怀着和保、罗、苏、捷等国人民同样的态度。苏联军队的正义行动，保、罗、苏、捷以及其他社会主义国家对匈牙利的这种全力支持，是社会主义国家之间亲密无间、患难与共的兄弟般关系的真正体现。在匈牙利全国人民的努力下，在社会主义各国的坚决支持和帮助下，匈牙利国内暂时的经济困难是可以逐渐得到克服的，匈牙利社会主义建设事业必将重新取得进展，帝国主义企图颠复匈牙利人民民主制度的阴谋是更加没有指望的了。
    紧接着保、匈、罗、苏、捷五国会谈以后，苏联政府代表团同德意志民主共和国政府代表团举行了会谈。在发表的苏德联合声明中，两国重申了对进一步发展苏德友好合作的决心，并且为此而规定了一些重要措施。两国将在最近期间内缔结关于苏军驻留在德意志民主共和国的法律地位的协定。苏联决定在1957年内扩大对民主德国的货物供应，并将贷给德意志民主共和国三亿四千万卢布的自由外汇，帮助德意志民主共和国顺利地发展国民经济。这些事实，以及苏联过去屡次减少以至完全免除德意志民主共和国对苏联的赔偿义务，对民主德国提供大量经济援助的事实，都说明苏联是德意志民主共和国人民的真正无私和可靠的朋友。
    苏德会谈的结果，对于加强德国历史上第一个工农国家——德意志民主共和国的主权独立和它的国际地位有着重要的意义。它再一次提醒那些无视现实的人们注意：要解决德国问题，必须首先承认作为主权国家存在的德意志民主共和国所享有的权利，必须通过德国人自己的协商而实现。
    保、匈、罗、苏、捷五国会谈和苏德会谈，是苏波、苏罗会谈以后社会主义国家关系中的新进展。此外，欧洲各社会主义国家的共产党和工人党之间也曾分别举行过许多次双边的会谈。所有这些会谈表明，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国正在继续高举着无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，为不断增进社会主义各国的团结合作而进行着重大的努力。尽管过去时期内在某些社会主义国家的关系中曾经发生过一些问题和缺点，但是这并没有也不可能在它们相互之间造成无法克服的矛盾。因为社会主义各国具有共同的马克思列宁主义的思想基础，具有维护和平和促进人类进步事业的共同的奋斗目标。社会主义各国人民和它们的工人阶级政党根据阶级斗争的长期历史经验和教训，懂得团结就是力量这一颠扑不破的真理，因此它们把不断地巩固和加强社会主义国家之间的团结当作自己最高的国际义务之一。也正因为这样，社会主义国家关系中的任何问题，都可以在完全平等、尊重独立主权、互不干涉内政的原则基础之上，经过真诚协商和同志式的讨论而获得圆满解决。而只要这样做了，社会主义国家之间的关系就会更加健全巩固，团结就会更加增强，从而为通过互助来进一步发展这些国家的经济文化和为维护和平事业创造更加有利的条件。人们看到，最近一个时期以来帝国主义的宣传机器曾大肆挑拨社会主义国家之间的友好关系。但是社会主义的事业总不是按照帝国主义者的逻辑和愿望发展的。社会主义国家间的团结不但不会削弱，而只会更加巩固和加强。毫无疑问，正在进行着的中苏会谈和即将进行的中波会谈，将对巩固和加强社会主义国家间的团结，作出新的、重大的贡献。
    五国会谈公报和苏德联合声明还注意到最近国际局势重新趋向紧张的事实。由于英、法、以对埃及的武装侵略，由于美帝国主义加紧对欧洲人民民主国家的颠复破坏活动，特别是由于美国统治集团制定“艾森豪威尔主义”而向中近东各国人民进行新的无耻的进攻，使得国际局势在走向缓和的道路上遇到了新的障碍。五国会谈公报在重申了社会主义国家的和平政策以后表明，“它们有充分决心要利用社会主义制度的力量和自己的影响，来粉碎侵略集团想使国际局势进一步紧张、加紧扩充军备、煽动战争狂热的企图。”我们坚决支持五国会谈公报所表示的这种决心。帝国主义的殖民主义扩张政策和它对世界社会主义力量的进攻，决不会加强帝国主义的地位，而只能加深它同全世界人民的矛盾和帝国主义集团内部的矛盾，只能遭到亚非各国一切爱国力量、全世界和平力量和社会主义力量的坚决反击。而与此相反，社会主义国家为巩固和发展相互之间团结合作的努力，却会带来重要的成果，进一步增强它们的力量。社会主义国家这种牢不可破的友谊和团结，是击败一切帝国主义阴谋和推动人类进步事业前进的重要保证。
