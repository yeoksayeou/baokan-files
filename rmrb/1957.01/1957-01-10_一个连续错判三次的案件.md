    A Case of Three Consecutive Wrong Judgments
    Wang Huandou, Luo Yunjun, Kong Ding
    The People's Court of Pi County, Sichuan Province, mistakenly sentenced Zhong Guilan to imprisonment three consecutive times, even though she insisted on fighting against counter-revolutionaries. Although this matter has now been initially handled, it still has educational significance, so we are still reporting it.
    Zhong Guilan is a liberated poor peasant living in Yejia Village, Tuanjie Township, Pi County, Sichuan. Her husband, Lan Yucai, is an oil press worker. Before liberation, Lan Yucai's four uncles and cousins, Lan Binru, Lan Shaohua, etc., were counter-revolutionaries who committed many evils. In the early days of liberation, they attempted to organize riots. Zhong Guilan heard the news beforehand and sent a letter to the local garrison of the People's Liberation Army. Later, through her lead in reporting, the people's government suppressed these four counter-revolutionaries in 1952.
    Lan Binru and others had an accomplice named Ye Xingze, a cunning and insidious enemy. Because some local farmers were temporarily deceived, Ye Xingze usurped the position of village representative director. Ye Xingze was deeply afraid that Zhong Guilan would see through his true colors, and he regarded Zhong Guilan as a thorn in his side, harboring the intention of harming her for a long time. But he was afraid of revealing his true intentions and could not figure out a way.
    In 1952, Zhong Guilan saw through Ye Xingze's ugly face and reported him to the district and township. The township also sent people to investigate, but they did not find any evidence, so the investigation was shelved. From then on, Ye Xingze hated her even more.
    The conspiracy to frame her emerged at this time. One morning, Lan Gao's, the wife of Lan Shaohua, who lived in the same courtyard, had a quarrel with Zhong Guilan because of a children's squabble. Lan Gao's had a low level of awareness and always believed that Zhong Guilan had harmed her husband, viciously slandering Zhong Guilan in her words. In a fit of anger, the two fought, and both were injured. Originally, the matter could have been settled with reconciliation. However, Ye Xingze, a hidden counter-revolutionary element, saw this as an opportunity. He incited Lan Gao's to smear her wounds with feces, expose them to the sun, and then wash them with water, causing the injuries to worsen rapidly. Then, he instigated her to create several more wounds and have her file a lawsuit in court.
    A wheelbarrow pushed a woman to the entrance of the People's Court of Pi County. Her injuries seemed very serious. This was Lan Gao's, the family member of the counter-revolutionary, claiming to have been beaten by Zhong Guilan. When she moaned and showed her swollen wounds to Judge Gao Shiqing (now the deputy director of the People's Court of Pi County), the judge couldn't help but be shocked, believing that "the defendant must be a fierce woman." Zhong Guilan was summoned to the court. Gao Shiqing looked up and saw that she was not as dejected as other defendants; nor was she as stuttering and silent as other defendants. She actually opened her voice and defended herself "boldly" as if she were in her own home. In Gao Shiqing's eyes, she was truly a "shrew," a "rare defendant," and it seemed that he had already sensed seven parts of her guilt without even questioning her.
    The trial began, and so did the arguments. A sharp conflict arose between the defendant and the judge. The judge did not investigate the background of the incident or the authenticity of the injuries. He only saw that the plaintiff's injuries were more serious than the defendant's, and he affirmed his view of Zhong Guilan. Zhong Guilan, this strong woman, of course, refused to accept this. The sound of their quarrel shook the entire courtroom, and this kind of argument hurt Gao Shiqing's "self-esteem." In order to end this embarrassing scene, Gao Shiqing said sternly: "First, heal Lan Gao's wounds, and then we will deal with the matter after investigation." Zhong Guilan was forced to pay a price of nine dou of rice to treat Lan Gao's injuries.
    When Gao Shiqing went to the scene for investigation, he did not get rid of his prejudice against Zhong Guilan. He believed that as long as he found corroboration on the two issues of who struck first and whether the injuries were real or fake, he could end the case.
    In the courtyard where Zhong Guilan lived, Gao Shiqing casually gathered four or five people for a discussion. He didn't know that most of these people were family members of counter-revolutionaries. He opened his mouth and asked: "Did Zhong Guilan strike first?" "Did she bite Lan Gao's?" "Yes," "Right," these words immediately entered his ears and were recorded in his notebook. At that time, some people also revealed the truth that Lan Gao's intentionally retaliated, and explained that "Lan Gao's cursed first," "Lan Gao's kicked Zhong Guilan's mouth," and Lan Gao's deliberately enlarged her injuries. Although very obvious contradictions had been exposed, pursuing the matter further would easily expose the enemy's conspiracy. However, Gao Shiqing limited his thinking to criminal matters, believing that other issues were irrelevant, and besides, the impression of "shrew" had already "taken root in his mind," making him blind and deaf to the opposing evidence. In the end, he closed his notebook and turned away.
    After Gao Shiqing returned, he immediately drafted a judgment, which read: "Zhong Guilan is habitually prone to biting people, and her character is extremely bad… she violently slapped the plaintiff…."
    Can a person be habitually prone to biting people? Can slapping someone be called a violent crime? People only need to use their brains a little to see that this is an inhumane and exaggerated judgment. However, when Li Zhenxin, the president of the People's Court of Pi County, saw this judgment, he felt that it was "reasonable" and that it would be difficult to appease the public anger if she were not sentenced. So he picked up his pen and signed a "Li" on the judgment to indicate his approval. This innocent woman was sentenced to six months of imprisonment, to be served outside of prison. At this time, she was pregnant.
    Zhong Guilan refused to accept this and appealed to the Wenjiang Branch of the People's Court of Sichuan Province. The branch sent a cadre who went early and returned at noon, without clarifying the truth, and hastily ended the investigation work. Soon, the Wenjiang Branch gave instructions to the People's Court of Pi County: "...execute according to the original judgment."
    Zhong Guilan refused to accept this judgment. Especially when Ye Xingze, the counter-revolutionary who manipulated the village regime, took the opportunity to attack her and illegally controlled her, she felt even more that this was an insult to the working people. During the general election, Zhong Guilan did not receive a voter certificate. She was worried that bad people would be elected and good people would lose, so she repeatedly went to get a voter certificate to fight for her due political rights. But under Ye Xingze's manipulation, all her efforts were in vain. When she saw Ye Xingze showing his fierce and cunning teeth as he walked into the meeting, she angrily cursed: "Even this dog has a voter certificate." In this way, Ye Xingze hated her even more and feared her even more. He openly ordered people to control her, but secretly ordered people to monitor her.
    On the first day of the Lunar New Year, every household went to the temple fair, and Zhong Guilan also took her children there. Ye Xingze was afraid that she would report the situation to the township government, so he sent several militiamen who did not know the truth to stop her. Zhong Guilan was not convinced and argued with them, but in the end, she still went.
    Ye Xingze seized these things, colluded with some backward village cadres, and falsely accused Zhong Guilan of "sabotaging the general election," "insulting cadres," and "disobeying control," and reported it to the court to frame her again.
    After seeing these materials, the court staff believed that it was "reasonable" for such a "savage" woman to "disobey control" and even "insult cadres." Therefore, they believed that there was no need to conduct further investigation and made an erroneous judgment based on these reported materials: "...the criminal has repeatedly refused to mend her ways, openly despised the laws and disciplines of our country, and slandered the cadres of our people's government, which is intolerable to today's new society and new morality... In order to punish the crime and educate the people, she is specially sentenced to two years of imprisonment." The president of the court again thought it was "reasonable" and once again signed a "Li" on this document.
    Zhong Guilan went to jail. She was always worried about her young children at home, "whether they were warm or cold," and called out to her beloved husband and elderly father in her dreams. One night, Zhong Guilan seemed to have returned to her own home. Just as she stepped into the door, she suddenly discovered that a counter-revolutionary was holding a knife to kill her child. This was because she missed her family so much that she had a nightmare. However, when she woke up from the dream, she was mentally distraught. Anxious, she stood up from the bed, and suddenly, her head broke through the tiles of the low prison cell.
    Originally, this was an understandable psychological state and behavior. However, after hearing this news, the court made such a bizarre deduction: this "shrew" has always disregarded the law and must be trying to escape from prison. Therefore, she was once again sentenced to an additional year of imprisonment.
    Zhong Guilan's fighting spirit was not frustrated. In prison, Zhong Guilan was full of longing for tomorrow, and she often sang songs about the liberation of farmers. When she heard the news of agricultural cooperativization, she laughed heartily. Whenever she had the opportunity to see Chairman Mao's portrait, her eyes would immediately shine with excitement. She felt energetic all over, and she firmly believed that one day, "Chairman Mao's good cadres will save me just like they led our farmers to liberation, and the counter-revolutionaries will be punished sooner or later."
    In mid-August of the year before last, the People's Court of Pi County encountered a problem: the "prisoner" Zhong Guilan often shouted at night, and there was a danger of her going crazy. To keep her in prison seemed like she had not committed a "too great crime"; to release her seemed difficult because she had always been unwilling to admit her mistakes. So they came to ask the county magistrate for instructions. After listening to the report, the county magistrate raised many questions. In order to clarify the truth, he immediately sent a working group to conduct an in-depth investigation of the case, which confirmed that Zhong Guilan was an innocent "criminal." The Communist Party Committee of Pi County specifically convened a meeting of the Standing Committee to examine their own bureaucracy and initially studied the handling of the case.
    When Zhong Guilan left the prison, her spirit had been greatly stimulated by more than two years of prison life, and she is now placed in a quiet room to recuperate. The county party committee also sent people to the village where she lived to explain the truth of the matter, restore her reputation, and understand her family's financial difficulties in order to provide subsidies. The county magistrate also visited her, praising her for her active struggle against counter-revolutionaries.
    Ye Xingze, the counter-revolutionary who framed Zhong Guilan, committed suicide in the summer of 1953 out of fear of punishment. At that time, the anti-counter-revolutionary movement was launched throughout the country, the eyes of the masses were sharpened, and they revealed Ye Xingze's crimes to the township, and the township sent people to investigate. Ye Xingze knew that he could no longer hide, so he drowned himself in the river and died.
    The county leadership is also studying the handling of the relevant personnel who wrongly sentenced Zhong Guilan to imprisonment. (Attached picture)

    一个连续错判三次的案件
    王焕斗　罗运钧　孔丁
    四川省郫县人民法院连续三次，把坚持同反革命分子作斗争的锺桂兰错判了徒刑。这件事虽然现在已经作了初步处理，但是，还有教育意义，所以仍然将它报道出来。
    锺桂兰是一个翻身的贫农，住在四川郫县团结乡叶家村，丈夫蓝玉才是个榨油工人。解放前，蓝玉才的四个叔伯兄弟蓝宾如、蓝少华等是作恶多端的反革命分子。解放初期，他们又企图组织暴乱。锺桂兰事先听到了消息，给驻防当地的解放军送过信。后来，经她带头检举，1952年人民政府镇压了这四个反革命分子。
    蓝宾如等人有一个同伙，叫叶兴泽，是一个狡猾阴险的敌人。因当地有些农民一时被蒙骗，叶兴泽篡夺了村代表主任的职务。叶兴泽深怕锺桂兰识破他的本来面目，视锺桂兰如眼中钉，早就存下了害她之意。但是他又怕露了马脚，始终想不出办法。
    1952年，锺桂兰识破了叶兴泽的丑恶面目，曾经向区乡检举，乡里也曾派人调查过，但没有找到证据，就搁下没有继续深入调查。从此，叶兴泽更把她恨入骨髓。
    陷害的阴谋，就在这时候出现了。一天早晨，因娃娃吵架，同院居住的蓝少华的老婆蓝高氏和锺桂兰发生了口角。蓝高氏觉悟低，一直认为是锺桂兰害了她的丈夫，言语中恶毒地诬蔑了锺桂兰。双方在激怒之下动了武，两人都受了伤。本来，一经和解便可了事。可是，暗藏的反革命分子叶兴泽却把这看成可乘之机，他蛊惑蓝高氏在伤口上涂了粪，晒太阳，再用水洗，使伤势急剧加重；接着，又唆使她制造了几处伤痕，让她到法院起诉。
    一辆独轮车，把一个妇女推到了郫县人民法院的门口，看来她的伤痕似乎很重，这就是声称被锺桂兰殴打的反革命分子的家属蓝高氏。当她呻吟着把红肿的伤痕叫审判员高世清（现任郫县人民法院副院长）看时，审判员不由得吃了一惊，认为“被告一定是个凶恶的妇女”。锺桂兰被传来法院了。高世清抬眼一看，只见她不像其他被告那么垂头丧气；也不像其他的被告那么结结巴巴不声不响。她居然像在自己家里一样，“大胆地”放开嗓门申辩。在高世清眼里，她真是一个“泼妇”，一个“罕见的被告”，似乎不用审问，已经察觉了七分。
    审讯开始了，争论也开始了，被告和审判员之间发生了尖锐的冲突。审判员不查事件的背景，不看伤痕的真伪，只看到原告比被告伤势重，就肯定了对锺桂兰的看法。锺桂兰，这个坚强的妇女当然不服。两人的争吵声震动了整个法庭，这样的争论伤害了高世清的“自尊心”。为了结束这个尴尬的场面，高世清声色俱厉地说：“先把伤口给蓝高氏医好，调查以后再来处理。”锺桂兰被迫付出了九斗米的代价，为蓝高氏医伤。
    高世清赴现场调查的时候，没有摆脱对锺桂兰的成见。他认为只要在谁先动手，伤痕是真是假这两个问题上找到旁证，就可以结束案件。
    在锺桂兰居住的院子里，高世清随便找了四、五个人座谈起来。他不知道这些人中多半是反革命分子的家属。他张口就问：“是锺桂兰先动手打人吧？”“她咬过蓝高氏吧？”“是”“对”，这些词儿立即钻入他的耳里，记在他的本上。当时，也有人揭露了蓝高氏有意报复的真象，并说明“是蓝高氏首先骂人”，“是蓝高氏踢破了锺桂兰的嘴”以及蓝高氏故意扩大伤势等情节。虽然已暴露出十分明显的矛盾，追问下去，敌人的阴谋极易戳穿。可是高世清把思想仅限于刑事问题上，认为其他问题与此无关，何况“泼妇”这一印象已“先入为主”，使他对反面的材料，视而不见，听而不闻。末了，他把本子一合，扭头就走。
    高世清回来以后，立即草拟了一份判决书，上面写道：“锺桂兰一贯咬人成性，品质极端恶劣……残暴地打了原告一个耳光……。”
    一个人能咬人成性？打一个耳光能称为残暴罪行？人们只要稍微动一下脑筋，便可看出这是一份不近人情和夸大事实的判决书。可是郫县人民法院院长李振信看到这份判决书时，反而觉得“言之有理”，不判刑难平民愤。他就提起笔来，在判决书上签了个“李”字，以示批准。这个无辜的妇女，就这样被判了六个月徒刑，监外执行。这时她正怀着孕。
    锺桂兰不服，她向四川省人民法院温江分院提出上诉。分院派来一个干部，早去午归，并没有查清真象，便草率结束了调查工作。不久，温江分院还给郫县人民法院来了个指示：“……按原判执行”。
    锺桂兰不服这个判决。尤其是操纵村政权的反革命分子叶兴泽乘机打击，对她非法管制时，她更感到这是对劳动人民的侮辱。普选的时候，锺桂兰没有领到选民证，她耽心坏人当选，好人落选，就一再去领选民证，争夺应享的政治权利。可是在叶兴泽的操纵下，都落了空。当她看到叶兴泽对她露着凶恶狡猾的牙齿走进会场时，她气愤地骂道：“这条狗都带上了选民证”。这样，叶兴泽更加恨她，也更加怕她了。他明里是叫人管制她，暗里是叫人监视她。
    这年正月初一，家家户户赶庙会，锺桂兰也带着娃娃去了。叶兴泽害怕她到乡政府反映情况，就派了几个不明真象的民兵阻拦她，锺桂兰不服气，争执了一番，到底还是去了。
    叶兴泽抓住这些事情，拉拢了一些落后的村干部，给锺桂兰安上“破坏普选”、“辱骂干部”、“不服管制”等罪名，上报法院，再次陷害。
    法院的工作人员看到这些材料以后，认为像这样一个“横蛮”的女人，“不服管制”、甚至“辱骂干部”是“合乎情理的”。因而，认为没有再作调查的必要，便把这些上报材料作了错误的判决：“……该犯屡教不改，公开蔑视我国家法纪，污蔑我人民政府干部，为今天新社会、新道德所不容……为了惩罚犯罪、教育人民，特判处徒刑二年。”法院院长又认为“言之有理”，又一次在这份公文上签了个“李”字。
    锺桂兰入狱了。她时时牵挂着家里的幼儿“是暖是冷”，梦里呼唤着心爱的丈夫和年迈的父亲。一天夜里，锺桂兰仿佛回到了自己的家。当她刚跨进家门的时候，突然发现有一个反革命分子提刀要杀她的孩子。这是她思家心切，作了一个恶梦。可是，她从梦中醒来时，精神恍惚。急得她从床上站立起来，一下子，她的头撞破了低矮监房的瓦。
    本来，这是容易理解的心理状态和行为。可是，法院听到这一消息后，却作了那么离奇的推断：这个“泼妇”一向目无法纪，一定是企图越狱。因此，又一次加判了她一年徒刑。
    锺桂兰的斗志并没有被挫折，在狱中，锺桂兰满怀着对明天的向往，她每每唱起农民翻身的歌曲。她听到农业合作化的消息时，一股劲儿地笑。她一有机会看到毛主席的像，眼睛里就立刻射出兴奋的光彩，她感到浑身是劲，她深信总有一天“毛主席的好干部就像领导我们农民翻身时一样，救我出来，而反革命分子早晚要受到惩办。”
    前年8月中旬，郫县人民法院遇到了一个难题：“犯人”锺桂兰夜里常常呼叫，有发疯的危险，关押她吧，似乎没有“太大的罪”；放了她吧，她一向又不肯承认错误。于是就来请示县长。县长听了汇报以后，发生了很多疑问。为了弄清真象，立即派出一个工作组对此案进行了深入的调查，证实了锺桂兰是一个无辜的“罪人”。中共郫县委员会为了这个问题，专门召开了常委会议，检查了自己的官僚主义，初步研究了对此案的处理办法。
    当锺桂兰离开监狱的时候，由于两年多来的狱中生活，她的精神受到了很大刺激，现在被安置在一个安静的屋子里休养。县委还派人到她居住的村子，讲解事情的真象，为她恢复名誉，并了解她的家庭生活困难情况，以便给以补助。县长也访问了她，表扬她积极同反革命分子作斗争的行为。
    陷害锺桂兰的反革命分子叶兴泽已经在1953年夏天畏罪自杀。当时，在全国开展了肃反运动，群众的眼睛擦亮了，又向乡里揭发了叶兴泽的罪恶，乡里派人进行了调查。叶兴泽知道再也隐藏不住了，就投河自杀身死。
    对于错判锺桂兰徒刑的有关人员，县的领导方面也在研究处理。（附图片）
