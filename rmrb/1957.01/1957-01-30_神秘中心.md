	"Mysterious Center"
	By Pan Fei, our correspondent
	The City of London, on the north bank of the Thames, is the very center of the entire city. The city walls have long disappeared; but the concept of "the City" has not. All of Britain's major banks are concentrated in the City of London, and "the City" has become synonymous with financial capital.

	The Bank of England is located in the center of the City. Every Thursday, it issues a "balance sheet," and the "government debt" item on the sheet has been the same number since 1844. It is said that the purpose of this almost joking practice is "not to give people real news." Therefore, the Bank of England is called "the most mysterious center of financial institutions."

	The appearance of the Bank of England building also looks very mysterious. It doesn't look like a bank; it looks like a castle. Four solid steel-reinforced concrete walls form a square. Each side of the wall has an iron door, but no windows. Britain's gold and dollar reserves are kept in its basement. Therefore, there is a British saying: "As safe as in the Bank of England." Of course, this metaphor is no longer appropriate. After the outbreak of the Suez Canal War, Britain's gold and dollar reserves were like being in a funnel. These four thick and solid walls cannot be 100% relied upon.

	Surrounding the Bank of England are dozens of large banks, insurance companies, and exchanges. This is an area shrouded in a special atmosphere. The winding streets appear narrower due to the tall buildings on both sides. On cloudy or foggy days, the light is dim even at noon. The street lights hanging in the center of the street sway in the wind; the windows of the tall buildings on both sides emit a hazy light, like the bloodshot eyes of someone whose health has been taken away by alcohol. People with tense faces hurry in and out of various gates.

	The area of the banking district is not large. The City of London, the financial capital, is much smaller than the geographical City of London. It is only about one square mile in total. However, it is the true master of Britain. No, in the nineteenth century, it was the financial center of the world. Now, this seat in the capitalist world has been taken by New York. But even so, the power of the City of London cannot be underestimated. According to statistics, about two-fifths of the trade in the capitalist world is paid for in pounds sterling; and every transaction paid for in pounds sterling is recorded in the books of the banks in the City of London.

	If banks are "mysterious," then exchanges should be even more mysterious. Whether out of affection or aversion, the British call the exchange "the zoo." In English, the exchange term "buying long" is "bull," which is synonymous with "cow"; "selling short" is "bear," which is synonymous with "bear." Since everyone active in the exchange are bulls and bears, calling the exchange "the zoo" is of course not disrespectful.

	We visited the largest "zoo" in London—the Stock Exchange. We entered through a side door, went up winding stairs, and arrived upstairs. At the entrance, there was a signature of Queen Elizabeth II of England. This was written by her during a visit to the exchange, and now it has been preserved in a glass cabinet as the highest honor of this exchange.

	From a small stand, you can overlook the activities in the entire exchange hall. In the hall, each side of the dozen or so polygonal pillars is inlaid with signs filled with Arabic numerals. One moment this number lights up, the next moment that number lights up. This indicates that someone wants to buy or sell stock in a certain company. There are almost no seats in the hall. People in neat suits, in groups of three or five, are busy talking. There are also people with a dazed look, always rolling their eyes to look at the smoke rings just spat out of their mouths. The floor is covered with scraps of paper. These people are the representatives and brokers of major companies, or, in other words, the "bears" and "bulls."

	To outsiders, it is difficult to understand what this large group of people is busy with. The stand and the hall are separated by glass, and you can only vaguely hear a buzzing sound. We found an exchange attendant, wearing a special uniform with two eye-catching red cloths inlaid on the collar. He was dressed very handsomely, but didn't seem to have the energy to answer our questions. It looked like he really wanted to end this conversation, so I quickly stuffed him with ten shillings. Like a chocolate vending machine on the streets of London, as soon as the money went in, there was an immediate reaction. He was radiant and talked endlessly, even spitting on other people's faces. He told us that this pillar is the African mineral market, that pillar is the Malayan tin market, and the other pillar is the oil stock market.... "The stocks sold here are not consistent with the face value," he began to reveal the mysterious curtain of the exchange to us, "a company can mark a stock worth one pound and sell it for two pounds...." If the technique is clever and played beautifully, then 100 million pounds can be turned into 200 million pounds in the blink of an eye.

	Banks, exchanges, and insurance companies constitute a huge financial institution. How great its power is, this is a question that needs to be answered by political economy textbooks. However, it may be helpful to introduce some simple facts and figures here: The famous five major British banks (Midland Bank, Lloyds Bank, National Provincial Bank, Westminster Bank, Barclays Bank) and the four largest insurance companies jointly control almost ten billion pounds. The one hundred or so directors of these five banks also serve as more than one thousand directorships in other small and medium-sized banks or enterprises. The banking institutions are complete and huge. Midland Bank and Barclays Bank each have more than 2,000 branches across the UK. In London, just as there is a church on every street, there is almost a branch or office of a bank on every street. Therefore, in addition to celebrating Christmas, the British also have another "national" holiday - "Bank Holiday." That is the first Monday in August each year. On this day, government agencies, shops, factories, schools... all take a day off.

	When financial oligarchs and state institutions combine, their power becomes immense. In fact, even some government leaders do not hide this issue. When Macmillan was Chancellor of the Exchequer, he said the following words at a gathering of bankers, in a state of inebriation: "Of course, all my life, except for the time I have worked in the government, I have served in the financial world."

	This is the variety of aspects of the City of London. No wonder, an author, in a book he wrote about British financial capital, quoted a passage of poetry by the British writer Lewis Carroll with a pessimistic mood as the ending of the book. This passage of poetry is:

	He thought he saw a Banker's Clerk
	Descending from the bus.
	He looked again, and found it was
	A Hippopotamus.
	“If this should stay to dine,” he said,
	“There won’t be much for us.” (Attached picture)

### “神秘中心”

    “神秘中心”
    本报记者　潘非
    伦敦城，在泰晤士河的北岸，正是全市的中心。城墙，早已没有了；但是“城”的概念并没有消失。英国所有的大银行，全都集中在伦敦城里，“城”便成了金融资本的代名词。
    英格兰银行位于“城”的中央。每逢星期四，它印发一张“平衡表”，表上的“政府债务”一项，从1844年以来，都是同一个数字。据说，这种近乎开玩笑的做法，目的就是“不给人以真实的消息”。因此，英格兰银行便被称为“金融机构中最神秘的中心”。
    英格兰银行这座建筑物的外貌，看起来也十分神秘。它不像银行，倒像个城堡。四堵结实的钢骨水泥墙壁，组成了一个正方形。每一边墙上都有扇铁门，但是，没有窗户。英国的黄金美元储备，就放在它的地下室里。因此，英国有句俗语：“像放在英格兰银行里一样保险。”当然，这个比喻现在已经不合时了。苏伊士运河的战争爆发以后，英国的黄金美元储备，就像放在个漏斗里一样。对这四堵宽厚坚实的墙壁，并不是可以百分之百地信赖的。
    围绕着英格兰银行，是几十家大银行、保险公司和交易所。这是一个笼罩着特殊气氛的地区。曲曲折折的街道，由于两边高大的建筑物而显得更加狭窄了。在阴天或有雾的日子里，即使在中午，光线也是昏暗的。挂在街中央的路灯随风摇曳；两边高楼大厦的窗户中，射出蒙胧的灯光，好像被酒精夺去了健康的人的充血的眼睛。面色紧张的人，匆匆忙忙地从各个大门里出出进进。
    银行区的面积并不大。金融资本的伦敦“城”，要比地理学上的伦敦城小得多。它总共不过一平方英里。可是，它是英国真正的主人。不，在十九世纪，它还是全世界的金融中心。现在，资本主义世界里的这把交椅，已经被纽约夺去了。不过即使这样，对伦敦“城”的势力还是不能低估。据统计，在资本主义世界中，约有五分之二的贸易，是用英镑来支付的；而每一笔用英镑来支付的交易，都记载在伦敦城银行的账簿上。
    如果说银行“神秘”，那末更神秘的应该是交易所了。不知是由于昵爱呢，还是由于厌恶，英国人把交易所叫做“动物园”。在英语里，交易所的术语“买空”是“bull”，这是“牛”的同义词；“卖空”是“bear”，是“熊”的同义词。既然在交易所里活动的都是牛和熊，把交易所叫做“动物园”当然并无不恭了。
    我们访问过伦敦最大的“动物园”——证券交易所。从一个侧门进去，通过曲曲折折的楼梯，到了楼上。进门处，陈列着英国女王伊丽莎白二世的签名。这是她在某次访问交易所的时候写下的，现在，这已被作为这个交易所的最高荣誉，保存在一个玻璃柜子里。
    在一个狭小的看台上，可以俯视整个交易所大厅里的活动。大厅中十几根多角形的柱子上，每一面都镶着排满了阿拉伯数字的牌子。一会儿这个数字亮了，一会儿那个数字亮了。这表示有人要买或要卖某一公司的股票。大厅中几乎没有座位。穿着笔挺的西服的人，三个一群，五个一堆，忙碌地交谈着。也有神态恍惚的人，老是翻着眼皮看刚从嘴里吐出来的烟圈。地上，是满地的纸屑。这些人，就是各大公司的代表和经纪人，或者说，就是“熊”和“牛”。
    在外行人看来，很难理解这一大堆人究竟在忙些什么。看台和大厅是用玻璃夹开了的，只能隐隐约约地听到一片嗡嗡声，我们找到了一位交易所的服务员，他穿着特别的制服，领子上镶着两块触目的红布。打扮得十分英俊，但对于我们的问题，却不大有精神回答。看样子，他很想结束这一场谈话了，我赶紧塞给他十个先令。如同伦敦街头卖巧格力糖的自动售货机一样，钱一塞进去，立刻有了反应。他精神焕发，谈话滔滔不绝，甚至把吐沫喷到了别人的脸上。他告诉我们，这个柱子是非洲的矿产市场，那个柱子是马来亚的锡的市场，另外一个柱子是石油股票的市场……。“在这里出售的股票，并不同票面的价值一致”，他开始向我们揭开了交易所的神秘之幕了，“一个公司可以把价值一镑的股票，标成两镑出卖……”。如果手法高明，玩得漂亮，那么一亿英镑在转眼之间便可以变成两亿英镑。
    银行、交易所，加上保险公司，这就构成了庞大的金融机构。它的势力究竟有多大，这是需要政治经济学教科书来回答的问题。但是，在这里不妨介绍一些简单的事实和数字：英国著名的五大银行（密德兰银行、劳埃德银行、国家地方银行、威斯特敏斯特银行、巴尔克莱银行）和四家最大的保险公司，共同控制了几乎一百亿英镑。这五家银行的一百多个董事，兼任了其他中小银行或企业公司的一千多个董事席位。银行机构完善庞大，密德兰银行和巴尔克莱银行，在英国全国，都各有二千家以上的分行。在伦敦，正像每一条街道上都有教堂一样，每一条街道也几乎都有银行的支行和办事处。所以，英国人除了过圣诞节以外，还有另外一个“全民的”节日——“银行日”。那是每年8月的第一个星期一。在这一天，国家机关、商店、工厂、学校……，都休假一天。
    当金融寡头和国家机构结合起来以后，他们的力量便大得无比了。其实，即使一些政府首脑，也并不隐讳这个问题。当麦克米伦还是财政大臣的时候，他在一次银行家的集会上，在酒酣耳热之余，说了这样几句话：“自然，我的一生，除了在政府工作的时间以外，全都服务于金融界。”
    这就是伦敦“城”的形形色色。无怪，有个作者在他写的有关英国金融资本的一本书里面，怀着悲观的情绪，引用了英国作家路易士·卡罗尔的一段诗句，作为该书的结束语。这段诗句是：
    他想他似乎看到了一个银行职员
      从公共汽车中走下。
    他又看了一眼，
    发现它原来是只蛤蟆。
    他说：“假如它同我们共餐，
    那末什么也不会给我们剩下。”（附图片）
