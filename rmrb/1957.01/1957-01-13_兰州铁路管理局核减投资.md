Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 12th – The Lanzhou Railway Administration has cut some unnecessary projects from this year's capital construction plan in order to better ensure the construction of key projects.

Some departments of this bureau blindly demanded the addition of equipment when compiling the plan. The units planned to purchase more than 100 computers and dozens of cars. Some buildings could have been used for several more years, but new ones were requested. In order to fully implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, the Lanzhou Railway Administration Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a cadre meeting to mobilize further efforts to tap the potential of existing equipment and reduce investment. After three repeated and serious discussions and studies of the plans submitted by various departments, the administration reduced the capital construction investment that was dispensable or could be postponed, saving a total of 20,026,000 yuan. The projects that were cut included the purchase of machinery such as cars, typewriters, cameras, and broadcasting equipment, as well as the construction of offices, station buildings, warehouses, fences, freight lines with small freight volume, and affiliated factories.

Capital construction that is necessary and feasible, such as replacing heavy steel rails, adding meeting stations, lengthening tracks, and reinforcing bridges on the Baoji-Lanzhou line to improve transportation capacity, will continue. In addition, some necessary projects have been added.

    兰州铁路管理局核减投资
    新华社兰州12日电　兰州铁路管理局从今年的基本建设计划中，削减了一些不必要的项目，以便更好地保证重点工程建设。
    这个局的有些部门原来在编制计划的时候，盲目要求增添设备。各单位仅计算机就计划购置一百多台，汽车要几十辆。有些建筑物本来可以再用几年，也要求新建。为了全面贯彻增产节约的精神，中共兰州铁路管理局委员会召开了干部会议，动员进一步发挥现有设备潜力，减少投资。管理局对各部门提出的计划，经过三次反复认真的讨论、研究，将可办可不办和可以缓办的基本建设投资加以核减，共计可以节省二千零二十六万元。削减的项目中，包括汽车、打字机、照像机、广播机等机具购置，办公室、站舍、仓库、围墙、个别货运量少的货物线和附属工厂的修建等。
    对于必须办而且可能办到的基本建设，如宝（鸡）兰（州）线为提高运输能力而进行的更换重型钢轨、增设会让站以及延长股道、加固桥梁等，都将继续进行。另外还增加了一些必须办的项目。
