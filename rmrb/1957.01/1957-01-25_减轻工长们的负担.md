    Relieve the Burden on Foremen
    The grassroots foremen of the various engineering companies under the Central South Engineering Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, in addition to conducting production and technical leadership for workers, also have to manage matters related to living welfare. Some even have to boil water for the workers. These tasks are already quite numerous. However, their superiors require them to fill out countless forms and attend endless meetings, leaving them breathless.
    According to statistics, each section has nineteen types of forms, most of which must be filled out by the foremen themselves. For the rest, they also have to jointly review and stamp or provide compilation data. Most of these foremen are promoted from among the workers, and their educational level is not high. According to statistics, out of 276 foremen, only six are able to fill out and review all the forms, and 87 are unable to fill them out at all. The rest can only fill out a portion. It is evident how difficult it is for them to fill out each form.
    They have to attend 32 fixed meetings every month, in addition to various ad hoc meetings, which make them dizzy. If the forms are submitted late or they are late for meetings, they will be criticized, reprimanded, and even publicly criticized.
    Can the relevant superiors who ask them for forms and call them to meetings relieve some of the burden on the foremen? Shuping

    减轻工长们的负担
    建筑工程部中南工程管理总局所属各工程公司的基层工长们，除了对工人进行生产和技术领导外，还要管理生活福利方面的事情，有的甚至要给工人挑开水。这些事情本来就够多了。但是他们的上级，还要他们填写数不清的表报，参加开不完的会，使他们喘不过气来。
    据统计，每个工段有十九种表报，大部分要工长们亲自填写，其余的也要会同审查盖章或提供编制资料。这些工长大多是从工人中提拔起来的，文化程度都不高。据统计，二百七十六个工长中，能够填写和审查全部表报的只有六人，根本不会填的就有八十七人，其余的只能填写一部分。可见，他们每填写一份表报是多么的困难啊。
    他们每月要参加三十二个固定的会议，另外还有各种临时性会议，弄得他们头昏眼花。表报送迟了，开会迟到了，还要受批评、指责，甚至通报批评。
    那些向他们要表报、召集他们开会的有关上级，能不能给工长们减轻点负担呢？　淑萍
