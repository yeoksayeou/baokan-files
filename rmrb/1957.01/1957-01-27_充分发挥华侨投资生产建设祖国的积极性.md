Give Full Play to the Enthusiasm of Overseas Chinese for Investing in Production and Construction of the Motherland
邢谷安

There are more than three million overseas Chinese from Fujian Province. In the era of old China, they suffered discrimination, exclusion, and persecution abroad, and their situation was very difficult. They eagerly hoped that the motherland would become prosperous and strong, and be able to protect their legitimate rights and interests.

As early as 1905, overseas Chinese raised funds to establish the Fujian Railway Company in order to build the motherland; after the Revolution of 1911, they organized dozens of groups to prepare for mining mineral deposits in Fujian Province; in addition, they also established Xiamen Water Company, Electric Light Company, Ferry Company...etc. However, these enterprises run by overseas Chinese collapsed one after another at that time due to the extortion and blackmail by reactionary officials and feudal landlords, as well as the impact of currency devaluation; even those that could barely maintain themselves were losing money year after year, and investors never received a penny of dividends. For example, the Fujian Railway Company only built a 28-kilometer railway from Songyu to Jiangdongqiao after its establishment, losing more than 1.4 million yuan in twelve years, and finally even the roadbed was demolished. Except for Yiji Company, which mined coking coal in Shaowu, the groups that prepared to mine mineral deposits all failed midway. The Xiamen Electric Light Company, which still existed at the time of liberation, had not issued dividends for nearly 20 years, and the Fuzhou Paper Mill lost money every year. After liberation, especially after the implementation of joint state-private ownership, the situation of these remaining enterprises completely changed. They had surpluses every year and continued to issue dividends, and investors truly benefited from the enterprises. One returned overseas Chinese said excitedly: "In the past, overseas Chinese returned to invest in the country, it was like throwing money into the sea, without even a sound; if liberation had come earlier, the money of overseas Chinese would not have been lost so severely."

For many years, the wish of overseas Chinese—the prosperity of the motherland—has been realized since the founding of the People's Republic of China. Now the motherland has emerged as a powerful country in the world, its international prestige is increasing day by day, and the situation of overseas Chinese has also improved accordingly. The rapid development of various construction undertakings in the motherland has greatly encouraged the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese. The broad masses of overseas Chinese have actively responded to the call of the motherland and enthusiastically invested in the construction of the motherland.

In the past seven years, more and more overseas Chinese from Fujian Province have returned to invest in the country. If the number of overseas Chinese investments in 1950 is taken as the base number, it increased by 235 times by 1955. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 70 large and small enterprises in Fujian Province established by overseas Chinese after liberation, including factories, farms, movie theaters, and department stores. Overseas Chinese investment has played a certain role in the country's efforts to earn foreign exchange, develop local industrial and agricultural production, and prosper the economy of overseas Chinese hometowns.

The state is considerate of the situation of overseas Chinese. In order to protect the interests of overseas Chinese and encourage them to return to invest in the country, it has given them various conveniences and meticulous care. The state stipulates that the shares of overseas Chinese who invest in joint state-private enterprises after liberation will still be privately owned after the completion of socialism, and can be disposed of according to the wishes of the investors, and fixed interest will be paid; investors can be given priority in employment; dividend income is legal income and is protected by the state. Overseas Chinese return to invest in the country is much safer than doing business overseas. An overseas Chinese surnamed Zheng said: "Overseas Chinese are under the eaves of others abroad, and their business is not guaranteed. They are in danger of bankruptcy at any time. Now the motherland has such care for overseas Chinese to return to invest, and from now on, overseas Chinese capital will no longer have to worry about a way out. The situation of overseas Chinese is really 'when the mountains and rivers are exhausted and there is no way out, there is light at the end of the tunnel'." The light of the motherland has also illuminated the road for overseas Chinese.

Fujian Overseas Chinese Investment Company is a joint state-private enterprise established by the state to facilitate overseas Chinese to return to invest in the country. Its task is to absorb overseas Chinese funds to participate in local industrial construction, develop production, and prosper the economy of overseas Chinese hometowns. The state tries its best to let overseas Chinese run factories with higher profits such as rosin, sugar, and oil extraction. Since its establishment in 1952, the Overseas Chinese Investment Company has built and expanded eleven factories that have been completed and put into production, including Quanzhou Sugar Factory, Fuqing Oil Factory, and Xiamen Cannery. In 1955, various factories improved their equipment, and all employees responded to the call of the state, launched the advanced producer movement, created and promoted many advanced working methods, greatly increased productivity, and thus increased profits. For example, the Tong'an Oil Factory increased its output by nearly four times,

    充分发挥华侨投资生产建设祖国的积极性
    邢谷安
    福建省在海外的华侨有三百多万人，在旧中国的时代，他们在国外受尽歧视、排斥和迫害，处境十分恶劣。他们迫切希望祖国富强，能够保障他们的正当权益。
    华侨为了建设祖国，早在1905年就集资创办过福建铁路公司；辛亥革命后又曾组织几十个团体准备开采福建省矿藏；此外还办有厦门市自来水公司、电灯公司、轮渡公司……等。但是这些华侨兴办的企业，在当时因受反动官吏、封建土豪的敲诈、勒索，以及货币贬值等影响，绝大多数相继倒闭；就是能够勉强维持下来的，也是年年亏本，投资人从来没有拿到一个铜板的股息。例如福建铁路公司，创办后仅修建了由嵩屿到江东桥一段长二十八公里的铁路，十二年里共亏本一百四十多万元，最后连路基都拆毁了。准备采矿的团体，除义记公司曾开采邵武焦煤矿外，其余的都中途流产。解放时尚存在的厦门电灯公司，将近二十年都没有发过股息，福建造纸厂年年亏本。到解放后，特别是实行了公私合营以后，这些残存下来的企业，情况完全改变了，年年有盈余，不断发股息，投资人才真正从企业中得到利益。有一位归侨非常激动地说：“从前华侨回国投资，简直是把钱投入大海，连响一声也没有；要是早点解放，华侨的钱就不会损失那么严重了。”
    多少年来华侨的愿望——祖国的强盛，从中华人民共和国成立那天起得到实现了。现在祖国已经以一个强大的国家出现于世界上，国际威望日益提高，华侨的处境也随着得到改善。祖国各项建设事业的突飞猛进，更大大鼓舞了华侨的爱国热情，广大华侨积极响应祖国的号召，踊跃投资参加祖国的建设。
    七年来福建省在海外的华侨回国投资的，愈来愈多。如果以1950年华侨投资数为基数，到1955年就增加了二百三十五倍。根据不完全的统计，福建全省解放后的侨办工厂、农牧场、影戏院、百货商店等大小企业有七十多家，华侨投资对国家争取外汇，发展地方工农业生产，繁荣侨乡经济，已经起了一定的作用。
    国家体贴到华侨的处境，为了保护华侨的利益，鼓励华侨回国投资，曾给予种种方便和无微不至的照顾。国家规定凡华侨解放后投资于公私合营企业的股金到社会主义建成后，仍作为私人所有，可以依照投资人的意愿来处理，并且给予定息；投资人就业可以优先录用；股息所得是合法收入，受国家保护。华侨回国投资比在海外做生意要稳当无数倍。一个姓郑的华侨说：“华侨在国外寄人篱下，做生意得不到保障，随时随地都有破产的危险；现在祖国对华侨回国投资有了这样的照顾，从此华侨的资金出路再也不用担忧了。华侨的境遇真是‘山穷水尽疑无路，柳暗花明又一村’”。祖国的光芒也照亮了华侨的道路。
    福建华侨投资公司，就是国家为了便利华侨回国投资而与华侨公私合营的企业，它的任务是吸收华侨资金参加地方工业建设，发展生产，繁荣侨乡经济。国家将利润较高的松香、蔗糖、榨油等工厂都尽量让给华侨兴办。华侨投资公司从1952年成立以来，兴建和扩建完成并投入生产的工厂已经有泉州糖厂、福清油厂、厦门罐头厂等十一个。1955年各个厂又改善了设备，全体职工又响应国家的号召，开展了先进生产者运动，创造和推广了很多先进的工作方法，生产力大大提高，利润也因而增加。如同安油厂增加产量将近四倍，泉州糖厂产量增加一倍半，产品单位成本降低24.8％。
    正在兴建和扩建中的还有仙游糖厂、古田红曲厂、福州造纸厂和永春天湖山煤矿等四个厂矿。其中仙游糖厂是福建省华侨兴办的最大的一个厂。它的日榨量为一千二百吨，每年可产白糖一万七千二百五十吨，可以为国家创造八百万元财富。天湖山的无烟煤藏量很丰，今后大量开采，可以满足闽南一带侨眷燃用。
    福建华侨投资公司四年来共发股息一百零四万元，这些股息绝大多数用于国内侨眷生活或子女的教育费，解决了侨眷很多困难。
    华侨在海外经营农林渔牧业的为数颇多，据1947年统计资料，马来亚华侨从事这些职业的约占14％。他们经营热带作物有丰富经验，是将来发展福建省热带作物的一支重要力量。国家为了便利和鼓励华侨回国投资创办农林牧业，颁布了“华侨申请使用国有的荒山荒地条例”。其中规定：华侨可以根据自己的意愿，采取公私合营、私资经营（如独资、合资、股份公司等）、合作社经营和个体经营等方式，向国家申请使用国有的荒山、荒地，从事农林牧业生产；公私合营和私资经营者，使用土地年限可以长到五十年；多年生作物在没有收益以前，或遇灾害而减产时，可以享受减税或免税的待遇；在使用期限内国家保护经营者合法收入；在技术上国家可以给予帮助。这个条例公布以后，华侨非常感动。一个姓林的归侨说：“华侨在海外经营农林牧业，使用人家的土地，经常得不到保障，随时随地都有被收回的可能，很多华侨已经失掉了原来的园地，无法继续从事经营。现在祖国对华侨回国投资经营农林牧业这样照顾，华侨的利益完全得到保障了。”这个条例公布后，各地华侨纷纷酝酿筹办农牧场，仅在条例公布后的一、二个月内，就连续办了七个场，投资数比以往的总数增加了一倍多。
    近七年来，在各级人民政府积极辅导下，福建全省已经建立起来并投入生产的华侨农场有十七个，各个场都在不同程度上得到发展。永春县猛虎山蓬莱华侨垦殖场，1953年建场以后的三年来已经栽种林木二十万多株，油料植物四万多株。龙岩县东宝山华侨垦牧场，已经种了一万多株各种名贵果树，春天满山遍野果花盛开，桃李争妍，一片油绿的柑林，景色尤为宜人，已成为游览地方。现在每逢假日经常有学生、工人去参观。1954年8月开始建场的公私合营龙溪华侨农场，已经种下柑桔桃李七千株，黄梨香蕉五万三千多株，所种的三百亩水稻1955年大丰收，比当地往年产量增加50％。华侨第一个机械化大型农场——福清县海口华侨机耕农场，在1955年1月建立起来了；这个场由勘察、设计到施工建场完全由省农业厅直接帮助，国家派去了有丰富经验的技术人员，供应了大量新式农具。全场有广阔肥沃的海边平原五千多亩，完全按最先进的方法来经营管理。
    福建荒山荒地很多，据初步调查约有一亿亩可用的荒山荒地尚待开发，适于发展热带和亚热带作物，将来有广阔的发展前途。福建省已派出大批勘察人员，到各地勘察适合开办农林牧场的场址。勘察完后，华侨可以自由选择地点，兴办农林牧场。
    华侨在国内都有一个可爱的家庭，只因在旧社会里，他们在国内没有办法生活，被迫抛下年轻的妻子，年迈的双亲到国外谋生。因此有许多华侨希望回家找职业。国家体贴华侨的这种心情，对投资人的就业问题非常关心，在华侨开办的企业中都尽量优先录用他们。企业实行公私合营后，很多投资人都被任命为厂长、经理。如福州新侨商店投资人李详照现在已任福州市百货公司副经理。福建华侨投资公司，根据工厂的需要和投资人的条件，已经优先安置了三十多人就业，如任命了高至荣先生为福清油厂的副厂长，张霭庭先生为龙岩电厂的副厂长；连永柏先生为武平松香厂的副厂长；还有八个投资人的子弟被介绍到省的机工学校学习。随着福建华侨投资公司业务的发展和其他华侨开办的新的企业、农牧场不断增多，投资人就业的机会就将更多。这意味着将有更多的华侨能够回到可爱的故乡找到职业，能够永远在家里同亲人团聚。
    华侨回国投资，是功在国家，利在自己。随着祖国建设不断发展，华侨回国投资的一定还要增加，他们的投资将使祖国，特别是侨乡建设得更美丽。
