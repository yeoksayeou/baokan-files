Xinhua News Agency, 7th - The State Council issued a directive on January 6th, requesting all levels of state organs, people's organizations, troops, and schools nationwide to conserve coal for heating and cooking. The directive stated: Although organs, organizations, troops, schools, and various units have made some savings in coal usage in recent years, there are still instances of waste. In order to implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, it is necessary to appropriately reduce coal consumption for heating and cooking in state organs and other units to support industrial construction and the needs of urban and rural people.

The State Council specifically requested in its directive: First, coal consumption for heating in all organs, organizations, troops, and schools should be reduced by 15% to 25% based on the original levels. Second, all organs, organizations, troops, and schools should improve coal-burning techniques and improve coal stoves to save coal in cooking. Third, the People's Committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government should do a good job in mobilization and publicity, organize coal-using units to exchange experiences in saving coal and mixing low-quality coal, and conduct timely supervision and inspection to do this work well.

    国务院指示机关、部队和学校节约用煤
    新华社7日讯　国务院于1月6日发出指示，要求全国各地各级国家机关、人民团体、部队和学校节约烤火和炊事用煤。指示说：几年来机关、团体、部队、学校和各单位在用煤上虽然有所节约，但仍有浪费现象，为了贯彻增产节约的精神，需要适当削减国家机关等单位的烤火和炊事用煤，以支持工业建设和城乡人民的需要。
    国务院在指示中具体要求：一、各机关、团体、部队、学校的烤火用煤，在原基础上核减15％到25％。二、各机关、团体、部队、学校在炊事用煤上，应提高烧煤技术，改进烧煤炉灶，节约用煤。三、各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会要做好动员和宣传工作，组织用煤单位交流节约用煤和掺烧低质煤的经验，并及时进行督促检查，做好这项工作。
