Reading "Family Teachings and National Studies"
    Wang Yiqun

    In the People's Daily on August 31st of last year, Mr. Bao Chang published an article entitled "Family Teachings and National Studies." At the beginning of his article, Mr. Bao quoted the "Biography of Confucian Scholars" from the Book of Later Han: "Thus, five classics scholars were established... The Book of Changes had the Shi, Meng, Liangqiu, and Jing schools; the Book of Documents had the Ouyang, Da Xiahou, and Xiao Xiahou schools; the Book of Poetry had the Qi, Lu, Han, and Mao schools; the Book of Rites had the Da Dai and Xiao Dai schools; and the Spring and Autumn Annals had the Yan and Yan schools, totaling fourteen scholars." If we count the schools mentioned here, we will find that there are fifteen, not fourteen. How did this happen? Originally, only the Qi, Lu, and Han schools were established as academic officials for the Book of Poetry during the Han Dynasty; the Mao school was not. The general preface to the "Biography of Confucian Scholars" in the Book of Later Han mistakenly added the character "Mao" when recording this event. In another instance, when simply mentioning "Poetry," there was no mistake: "(The Qi, Lu, and Han) three schools all established scholars... (The Mao Poetry) was not established." Qing Dynasty scholars had already discovered this error in the general preface to the "Biography of Confucian Scholars" in the Book of Later Han. He Zhuo said: "Gu Yanwu said: Adding a 'Mao' character, at this time Mao Poetry was not established. Moreover, in this case, there are fifteen scholars, not fourteen." (Hui Dong's Annotations to the Book of Later Han) I wonder why Mr. Bao did not notice this small problem when quoting this record from the Book of Later Han?

    Secondly, Mr. Bao said that "using 'family teachings' to teach academic subjects was a matter of necessity at the time" because "Qin Shihuang once burned books and buried scholars," resulting in "almost no classics being left at the time." Therefore, "the few surviving old scholars had no choice but to pass them down through 'family teachings.'" I am not sure what Mr. Bao means by "at the time." Judging from the placement of this passage immediately after the quoted original text from the "Biography of Confucian Scholars" in the Book of Later Han, "at the time" must refer to "after the restoration of Guangwu in the Han Dynasty." If this assumption is correct, then what Mr. Bao said differs greatly from specific historical facts. Indeed, due to Qin Shihuang's burning of books and burying of scholars, "rites collapsed and music was ruined, and books were incomplete," so old scholars like Fu Sheng were indeed forced to use family teachings to impart academic subjects. Doing so had a positive significance for preserving academic heritage. However, the "Biography of Confucian Scholars" in the Book of Later Han clearly states that the reason for the "collapse of rites and music and the fragmentation of classical texts" during the early Eastern Han Dynasty was due to "the chaos during the reign of Wang Mang and Gengshi." Attributing it to Qin Shihuang's account is unfair. If Mr. Bao's "at the time" refers to the early Western Han Dynasty, but there is no mention of the Western Han Dynasty in Mr. Bao's article, then such negligence in writing is truly inexcusable.

    It must be emphasized that the establishment of the five classics scholars during the Han Dynasty and the contention of a hundred schools of thought during the pre-Qin period cannot be confused, whether from a spiritual or consequential perspective. Historical facts show us that the establishment of the five classics scholars in the Han Dynasty was essentially a concrete measure to "banish the hundred schools and venerate Confucianism alone." The purpose of "banishing the hundred schools and venerating Confucianism alone" was to "eliminate heretical and deviant theories, so that the system can be unified, laws can be clarified, and the people will know what to follow" (Biography of Dong Zhongshu). In today's terms, it was to unify thought to achieve the purpose of consolidating rule. I ask, how different is this in spirit from the pre-Qin era when "sage kings did not arise... and hermits debated freely"? Historical facts also tell us that the Han government required the five classics scholars to strictly adhere to family teachings and did not allow them to absorb the strengths of other schools to compensate for the weaknesses of their own or enrich their own school's content; otherwise, they risked failing to become scholars. Regarding this, the "Biography of Confucian Scholars" in the Book of Later Han provides us with a typical example: "Zhang Xuan... learned the Yan school of the Spring and Autumn Annals in his youth and was versed in several schools of thought... Whenever there were difficult questions, he would explain the theories of several schools and allow them to choose what they were comfortable with, and the scholars were all convinced by his extensive knowledge... When the position of Yan school scholar became vacant, Xuan passed the examination with the highest score and was appointed as a scholar. After a few months, the students reported that Xuan also taught the theories of the Yan and Xuan schools and should not be exclusively a Yan school scholar. Guangwu ordered him to return to his former position, but he died before he could be transferred." This "well-versed" Zhang Xuan was dismissed from his position as a scholar because he "explained the theories of several schools and allowed them to choose what they were comfortable with." I ask, how different is this in spirit from the pre-Qin scholars who criticized each other, "where the winners did not lose what they held, and the losers gained what they sought"? Perhaps some may say: The Han Dynasty's establishment of the five classics scholars did allow for the existence of different schools of thought. For example, there were only five classics, but fourteen schools were allowed to exist simultaneously, and they were even allowed to debate each other. Does this not show that the Han Dynasty had a certain degree of academic freedom? And this supposedly brought "benefits"—"one classic was explained to over a million words, and the number of masters reached over a thousand people." Does this not show the prosperity of Han Dynasty scholarship? Yes, the Han Dynasty allowed some (note, only Confucian, the other hundred schools were banished) schools to coexist and allowed them to debate each other. This is a fact. However, this was limited, and the limit was not to undermine the unity of thought. If the emperor felt that the debates between the schools were too diverse, he would immediately intervene and impose unity. The most famous examples: During the Former Han Dynasty, Emperor Xuan "issued an edict to the scholars to discuss the similarities and differences of the five classics... and the emperor personally made the final decision" (Annals of Emperor Xuan of the Book of Han, 3rd year of Ganlu); during the Later Han Dynasty, Emperor Zhang "ordered the Grand Master of Ceremonies to gather the great officers, scholars, doctoral academicians, gentlemen-in-waiting, and students to the White Tiger Hall to discuss the similarities and differences of the five classics... and the emperor personally made the final decision" (Annals of Emperor Zhang of the Book of Later Han, 4th year of Jianchu), and "made a record of the White Tiger Conference" to unify thought. I ask, how much freedom of thought was there here? And without freedom of thought, how can we talk about academic prosperity? As for saying that "one classic was explained to over a million words, and the number of masters reached over a thousand people" was "another 'contention of a hundred schools of thought'," this is even more erroneous. These two sentences come from the "In Praise of Confucian Scholars" in the Book of Han. After recording this phenomenon, Ban Gu immediately analyzed the reasons, saying: "This was due to the path of fame and wealth." It was precisely for "fame and wealth" that many people in the Han Dynasty devoted themselves to studying the classics, leading to "over a thousand masters"; it was also for "fame and wealth" that many classical scholars in the Han Dynasty did not hesitate to take the path of trivial and detailed annotations, to the point that "one classic was explained to over a million words." Regarding this issue, the words of the famous Western Han Dynasty classical scholars Xiahou Sheng and his nephew are very clear: "Sheng often said to his students during lectures: Scholars are troubled by not understanding the classics; if they understand the classics, then obtaining high official positions is as easy as picking up mustard seeds from the ground." "(Xiahou Jian) had elaborate rhetoric. Sheng criticized him, saying: Jian is a petty scholar who focuses on the details of the chapters and verses and breaks up the great Way. Jian also criticized Sheng for being cursory in his learning and unable to respond to opponents" (Biography of Xiahou Sheng in the Book of Han). Originally, their study of the classics was only for "obtaining high official positions," that is, for "fame and wealth"; their "fragmented explanations and evasive arguments, clever rhetoric" (Treatise on Literature and Art) was only to "respond to opponents," and "responding to opponents" was to preserve "fame and wealth." I ask, how can this be compared to the great atmosphere where "the learning of the various masters all arose from addressing the evils of the times"? In short, I believe that whether focusing on spirit or consequences, there is no reason to conflate the establishment of the five classics scholars during the Han Dynasty with the contention of a hundred schools of thought during the pre-Qin period.

    As for whether we still need "family teachings" today, I think this depends on how we understand "family teachings." If, like most classical scholars in the Han Dynasty, we only dare to strictly adhere to what was passed down from our teachers, and dare not broadly adopt diverse views, learn from each other's strengths, and adapt to the times to innovate; or like some Han scholars in the Qing Dynasty, we blindly believe in the ancient annotations of Han scholars without distinguishing between right and wrong, and denounce anyone whose "ideas are not purely based on the ancient annotations of Han scholars" as "not truly insightful" (Jiang Fan's Records of the Lineage of Han Learning), then such "family teachings" will only make our thinking rigid and stagnate our scholarship. Clearly, such "family teachings" are not what we need. If we understand "family teachings" as the methods and achievements of predecessors in the history of scholarship, and inherit, utilize, and develop them, then "family teachings" are certainly still needed for us. But this is fundamentally different from the Han Confucian scholars' "passing down through family teachings" that Mr. Bao praised so much.

    读“家法与国学”
    王翌群
    去年8月31日的人民日报上刊载了鲍昌先生的题为“家法与国学”的文章。鲍先生在文章的开头引用后汉书儒林传：“于是立五经博士，……易有施、孟、梁丘、京氏；尚书欧阳、大、小夏侯；诗齐、鲁、韩、毛；礼大、小戴；春秋严、颜，凡十四博士”。如果我们数一下这里所引诸家，便会发现所举的博士是十五家，而不是十四家，这是怎么一回事呢？原来诗在汉代立于学官的只是齐、鲁、韩三家，而没有毛诗。后汉书儒林传总序在记载此事时衍了一个“毛”字，另一处在单记“诗”时便没有错：“（齐、鲁、韩）三家皆立博士。……（毛诗）未得立”。后汉书儒林传总序这一衍字，清朝的学者早就发现了，“何焯曰：顾炎武云：衍一毛字，此时毛诗未得立也。且如此，乃十五博士，非十四矣。”（惠栋后汉书补注）不知鲍先生在引用后汉书这段记载时，为什么没有注意到这个小问题？
    其次，鲍先生说“用‘家法’来讲授学术，在当时是迫不得已的事”，因为“秦始皇曾经焚书坑儒”，弄得“当时几乎没有留下多少典籍”，因而“硕果仅存的老先生们，便只好传之以‘家法’”了。我不了解鲍先生这里所说的“当时”是指什么时候，看鲍先生将这段文字紧放在引证的后汉书儒林传原文之后，则这里所说的“当时”一定是“汉朝光武中兴后”了。如果这一推测不误，则鲍先生所说与具体历史大有出入。诚然，由于秦始皇焚书坑儒，致使“礼坏乐崩，书缺简脱”，因之诸老先生如伏生等用家法来讲授学术，确是迫不得已的事。而这样做，对于保存学术遗产也有其积极的意义。但东汉初所以会“礼乐分崩，典文残落”，后汉书儒林传明言是由于“王莽、更始之际，天下散乱”的缘故，也把它记在秦始皇的帐上，是不公允的。——如果鲍先生所说的“当时”是指西汉前期，而鲍先生文中却无一语提到西汉，则行文的疏略，实在是不应该的。
    必须着重指出：两汉时的立五经博士，和先秦时的百家争鸣，无论从精神上来看，无论从后果上来看，都不容混为一谈。历史事实昭示我们：汉代的立五经博士实质上是“罢黜百家，独尊儒术”的具体措施；而“罢黜百家，独尊儒术”的目的在于使“邪辟之说灭息，然后统纪可一，而法度可明，民知所从矣”（董仲舒传）。用现在的话来说，就是为了统一思想以达到巩固统治的目的。试问这和先秦时的“圣王不作……处士横议”，在精神上相差多少远？历史事实还告诉我们：汉政府对五经博士的要求是谨守家法，而不许他们吸取别一学派的长处来弥补自己这一学派的短处，丰富自己这一学派的内容，否则就有当不成博士的危险。关于这，后汉书儒林传给我们留下了一个有典型意义的例证：“张玄……少习颜氏春秋，兼通数家法。……及有难者，辄为张数家之说，令择从所安，诸儒皆伏其多通。……会颜氏博士缺，玄试策第一，拜为博士。居数月，诸生上言，玄兼说严氏、宣氏，不宜专为颜氏博士。光武且令还署，未及迁而卒”。这位“多通”的张玄就因为教授时“张数家之说，令择从所安”，结果被革去了博士的官职。试问这和先秦诸子互相攻错，“胜者不失其所守，不胜者得其所求”，在精神上又有多大的距离？也许有人会说：汉代立五经博士，到底容许了不同学派的存在，如经只有五种，却容许十四个学派同时存在，而且还容许他们相互论难，这不说明汉代有一定的学术自由么？而这据说还带来“好处”——“一经说至百余万言，大师众至千余人”，这不说明汉代学术的繁荣么？是的，汉代容许儒家的（注意只是儒家，其他百家都被罢黜了。）某些学派同时存在，并且容许他们相互论难，这是事实。然而这是有限度的，限度是不致破坏思想的统一。如果皇帝感到诸家相互论难，过于异说纷纭的话，马上就来干涉，强加统一。最著名的例证：前汉有宣帝“诏诸儒讲五经同异，……上亲称制临决焉”（汉书宣帝纪甘露三年）；后汉有章帝“下太常将大夫博士议郎郎官及诸生诸儒会白虎观，讲议五经同异，……帝亲称制临决”（后汉书章帝纪建初四年），并“作白虎议奏”以统一思想。试问这里又有几许思想自由？而没有思想自由，又怎么谈得上学术繁荣？至于把“一经说至百余万言，大师众至千余人”，说成“又是一次‘百家争鸣’”，更是错误。按这两句话见汉书儒林传赞。班固在记载了这一现象后，紧接着就分析其原因说：“盖禄利之途然也”。正是为了“禄利”，汉代才有许多人皓首穷经，才会“大师众至千余人”；也是为了“禄利”，汉代许多经师就不惜走上繁琐笺证的道路，以至“一经说至百余万言”。对于这问题，西汉著名的经师夏侯胜叔侄的话说得再明白不过了：“胜每讲授，常谓诸生曰：士病不明经术，经术苟明，其取青紫如俯拾地芥耳。”“（夏侯建）具文饰说。胜非之曰：建所谓章句小儒，破碎大道。建亦非胜为学疏略，难以应敌”（汉书夏侯胜传）。原来他们的穷经只是为了“取青紫”也就是为了“禄利”；其“碎义逃难，便辞巧说”（艺文志）只是为了“应敌”，而“应敌”又是为了保住“禄利”，试问这又怎么能和“诸子之学皆出于救时之弊”的伟大气象相提并论？总之，我认为无论着眼于精神或后果，都没有理由把两汉时的立五经博士与先秦时的百家争鸣牵合在一起。
    至于在今天我们还需要不需要“家法”呢？我认为这须看我们对“家法”作如何的理解。如果像汉代大多数经师那样，只敢谨守师承，不敢旁采众说，取长补短，也不敢适应时势，推陈出新；或者像清代某些汉学家那样，不分是非地迷信汉儒古注，一看到“意不纯乎汉儒古注者”，便斥为“岂真知灼见者哉”（江藩汉学师承记），则这样的“家法”只会使我们的思维僵化，使我国的学术停滞不前。很显然的，这样的“家法”不是我们所需要的。如果我们把“家法”理解成为学术史上先行者治学的方法与成果，而对它加以继承、运用并发展的话，则“家法”对我们当然还是需要的。但这和鲍先生所盛称的汉儒的“传之以家法”就有着根本的不同。
