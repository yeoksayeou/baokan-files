Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 4th - Indonesian government parties held a meeting yesterday to exchange views on the status of the current cabinet. According to the meeting spokesman, the government parties have reached some understanding on the "issue of improving the cabinet," but there are still divergent opinions on the current domestic situation.

When an Antara News Agency reporter asked the meeting spokesman whether "improving the cabinet" meant "reshuffling the cabinet," the spokesman declined to answer.

The spokesman also said that the meeting did not discuss the issue previously raised by the Masyumi Party of dissolving the cabinet or withdrawing Masyumi Party members from the cabinet.

According to the "Social Messenger," at yesterday's meeting, each party expressed its position. The Masyumi Party believes that the only way to prevent it from withdrawing from the cabinet is to thoroughly reorganize the current cabinet, including replacing Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo. The Indonesian Nationalist Party still insists on maintaining the current cabinet but believes that the position of Minister of Defense, currently held concurrently by the Prime Minister, could be given to a non-partisan person. The Islamic Teachers Association and the other two Islamic parties stated that creating a cabinet crisis at this time would be irresponsible, but the current cabinet should be improved. The meeting did not yield a clear result.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 4th - According to Antara News Agency: The Indonesian Muslim League, composed of the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association, the Indonesian Islamic Union Party, and the Perti Islamic Party, made a decision at a meeting held on December 31st, believing that the current cabinet should be maintained.

Masyumi Party Chairman Natsir met with Indonesian Islamic Union Party Chairman Kartawinata on the morning of the 2nd to discuss the status of the cabinet in the face of the country's current difficulties. The news said that Kartawinata told Natsir that the Muslim League opposes a cabinet crisis at this time, because a cabinet crisis caused by the events in North Sumatra and Central Sumatra would only set a bad precedent.

On the same day, representatives of the Masyumi Party, the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association, the Indonesian Islamic Union Party, and the Perti Islamic Party held a joint meeting. Kartawinata said after the meeting that the purpose of the meeting was to seek a common understanding on the country's recent developments, but the representatives of the four Islamic political parties have not yet reached a final agreement and will continue discussions in the near future.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 4th - According to an Antara News Agency report on the 3rd, Information Minister Sudibjo told Antara News Agency reporters that he was "very uneasy" about Masyumi Party Chairman Natsir's remarks that "the current cabinet has completely lost its power and prestige."

Sudibjo said, "Wouldn't it be wiser if Natsir contributed a little effort to help the efforts made so far to quell the domestic tension?"

    印度尼西亚各政府党
    对改善内阁问题取得一些谅解
    穆斯林同盟认为应维持现内阁
    新华社雅加达4日电　印度尼西亚各政府党昨天举行会议，交换对现内阁地位问题的意见。据会议发言人说，各政府党对“改善内阁问题”已经取得了一些谅解，但是对目前国内形势还有分歧的意见。
    安塔拉通讯社记者曾经问会议发言人，“改善内阁”是不是指“改组内阁”，发言人不愿意回答这个问题。
    发言人又说，会议没有讨论马斯友美党以前提的解散内阁或者撤回马斯友美党的阁员的问题。
    据“社会使者报”透露，在昨天的会议上，各党派都表示了自己的立场，马斯友美党认为唯一能够阻止它退出内阁的办法是彻底改组现内阁，包括更换总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约。印度尼西亚国民党仍然坚持维持现内阁，但认为现由总理兼任的国防部长一席可以让给无党无派人士担任。伊斯兰教师联合会和其他两个伊斯兰教党派都表示目前制造内阁危机是不负责任的，但是应该改善现内阁。会议并没有得到明确的结果。
    新华社雅加达4日电　据安塔拉通讯社讯：由印度尼西亚伊斯兰教师联合会、印度尼西亚伊斯兰联盟党和白尔蒂伊斯兰党三个伊斯兰党组成的印度尼西亚穆斯林同盟在12月31日举行的会议上作出决定，认为现内阁应该加以维持。
    马斯友美党主席纳席尔在2日上午同印度尼西亚伊斯兰联盟党主席卡塔威纳塔就内阁在目前国家面临困难的情况下所处的地位问题进行了会谈。消息说，卡塔威纳塔曾经对纳席尔说，穆斯林同盟反对在这个时候发生内阁危机，理由是，由于北苏门答腊和中苏门答腊的事件而造成内阁危机，只会是一个糟糕的先例。
    同一天，马斯友美党、印度尼西亚伊斯兰教师联合会、印度尼西亚伊斯兰联盟党和白尔蒂伊斯兰党的代表们举行了联席会议。卡塔威纳塔在会后说，这次会议的目的是要就国家最近的发展形势求得共同的谅解，但是，四个伊斯兰政党的代表们还没有达成最后的协议，最近还将继续进行讨论。
    新华社雅加达4日电　据安塔拉通讯社3日报道，情报部长苏迪比约向安塔拉通讯社记者表示，他对马斯友美党主席纳席尔关于“现内阁已经完全丧失了权力和威信”的言论“感到非常不安”。
    苏迪比约说，“如果纳席尔稍微出一点力量，帮助到目前为止为了平定国内紧张局势而进行的努力，难道不是更加明智的事吗”？
