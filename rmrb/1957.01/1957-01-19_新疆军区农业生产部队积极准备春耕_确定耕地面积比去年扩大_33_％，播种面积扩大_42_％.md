    Agricultural Production Troops of the Xinjiang Military Region Actively Prepare for Spring Planting
    Cultivated Land Area Set to Expand by 33%, Sown Area by 42%
    (Our dispatch) The agricultural production troops of the Xinjiang Military Region are actively carrying out spring planting preparations. This year, according to the needs of national production development, the agricultural production troops have initially determined the cultivated land area to be 3.19 million mu, an expansion of 33% compared to last year; the sown area will be 2.26 million mu, an expansion of 42%. Among these, the area for grain crops has expanded by 35.8%, and the area for cotton has expanded by 26.4%. To ensure the completion of this year's production tasks, careful arrangements have been made for the large numbers of tractors, agricultural implements, chemical fertilizers, and fuel needed for the machines that will be added; the oil needed before spring planting has been promptly allocated to the farms. Currently, each reclamation area north and south of the Tianshan Mountains is intensifying various preparatory tasks before sowing, based on production tasks. The original tractors and other various machines of each farm are being overhauled, and some have already been repaired and stored in warehouses. This year, the agricultural production troops' farming technology will undergo new reforms based on the suggestions of Soviet experts. For example, cotton and corn will adopt longitudinal row planting and transverse intertillage. To ensure the smooth implementation of the new farming techniques, each reclamation area has successively opened production technology training classes since December of last year. Winter fertilizer accumulation and transportation are also currently underway. Soldiers of the Anjihai Farm in the Manas River Reclamation Area are using rubber-tired tractors to transport large amounts of fertilizer to the land ready for planting; the Urumqi Reclamation Area has prepared over 170 million jin of fertilizer, and most of the various seeds for sowing have also been prepared.

    新疆军区农业生产部队积极准备春耕
    确定耕地面积比去年扩大33％，播种面积扩大42％
    本报讯　新疆军区农业生产部队正在积极进行春耕准备工作。今年，农业生产部队根据国家生产发展的需要，初步确定耕地面积为三百一十九万亩，比去年扩大33％；播种面积二百二十六万亩，扩大42％。其中粮食作物面积扩大了35.8％，棉花面积扩大了26.4％。为了保证完成今年生产任务需要增加的大批拖拉机、农机具、化学肥料和机器需要的燃料，已经作了周密的筹措；春耕前需要的油料等，已经及时调拨给各农场。现在，天山南北各垦区正根据生产任务，加紧进行播种前的各项准备工作。各农场原有的拖拉机及其他各种机械，正在进行检修，有的已经修好存进库房。今年农业生产部队的农业耕作技术，根据苏联专家的建议，将进行新的改革。如棉花、玉米将采取纵向条播和横向中耕。为保证新的耕作技术顺利贯彻实行，各垦区从去年12月开始，陆续开办了生产技术训练班。冬季积肥运肥工作，目前也正在进行。玛纳斯河垦区安集海农场的战士们，正用胶轮拖拉机把大量的肥料运到准备耕种的地里；乌鲁木齐垦区已经准备了一亿七千多万斤的肥料，播种用的各种种籽大部分也已经准备好了。
