Reinforced Concrete Poles

When erecting high-voltage transmission lines, iron towers are generally used to raise the high-voltage lines by several meters or more than ten meters when encountering navigable waterways or dense residential areas. The Shanghai Electric Power Design Institute used reinforced concrete poles to replace more than 80 iron towers in the design of eight transmission lines, including Shanghai to Wangting and Nanjing to Ma'anshan, which can save more than 200 tons of steel and more than 100 tons of cement for building tower foundations.

    钢筋混凝土电杆
    在架设高压输电线的时候，遇到通航河道或密集的居民点，一般都用铁塔把高压线抬高几公尺或十多公尺。上海电力设计分院在设计上海到望亭、南京到马鞍山等八条输电线路中，用钢筋混凝土杆代替了八十多座铁塔，可以节省钢材两百多吨和建筑塔基用的水泥一百多吨。
