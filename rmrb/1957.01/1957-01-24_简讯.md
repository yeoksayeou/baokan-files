In the past year alone, in the Lhasa area alone, about one thousand Tibetan youths have been promoted to cadres or trained as junior technicians.
	On various construction sites in Lhasa, Tibetan youth workers are the most active. They often overfulfill their tasks, and many young workers have won the title of work model.

    西藏青年在成长
    西藏青年已逐渐成长为建设西藏的一支生力军。现在，在西藏高原的拖拉机上、化验室里、发电机旁，到处都有西藏男女青年在愉快地工作和学习着。去年一年，光是在拉萨地区，就有约一千名藏族青年被提拔为干部或被培养为初级技术工人。
    在拉萨的各个建筑工地上，藏族青年工人最为活跃。他们经常超额完成任务，许多青年工人获得了工作模范的称号。去年5月，建筑拉萨水力发电厂的藏族青年女工央金，被选为先进工作者，出席了全国先进工作者代表会议。
