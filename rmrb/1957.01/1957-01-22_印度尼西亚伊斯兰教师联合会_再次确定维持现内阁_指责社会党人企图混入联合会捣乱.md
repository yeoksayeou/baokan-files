Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 21st. The Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association, at its Central Committee meeting on the 18th, reaffirmed its support for the current cabinet. The meeting reiterated that dissolving the cabinet would be an irresponsible act.

Hathib Nuruddin, a committee member of the Central Sumatra branch of the Islamic Teachers Association, accused Indonesian socialists on the 21st of attempting to infiltrate and disrupt the Islamic Teachers Association from within. Jaid Abidin, a socialist who falsely claimed to be a committee member of the Central Sumatra branch of the Islamic Teachers Association, broadcast on the radio on the 18th that if the Central Committee of the Islamic Teachers Association did not withdraw its cabinet members from the current cabinet, the Central Sumatra branch would sever ties with the central organization. Nuruddin said that this news was untrue and that Jaid Abidin was not a member of the Islamic Teachers Association at all.

    印度尼西亚伊斯兰教师联合会
    再次确定维持现内阁
    指责社会党人企图混入联合会捣乱
    新华社雅加达21日电　印度尼西亚伊斯兰教师联合会在18日举行的中央委员会会议上再次确定维持现内阁。会议重申解散内阁是一种不负责任的行动。
    伊斯兰教师联合会中苏门答腊支部委员哈提布·努尔丁在21日指责印度尼西亚社会党人企图渗入伊斯兰教师联合会内部进行捣乱。一个自称为伊斯兰教师联合会中苏门答腊支部委员的社会党人贾伊德·阿比丁18日在电台广播说，伊斯兰教师联合会中央委员会如果不从现内阁中撤回阁员，中苏门答腊支部将断绝同中央的联系。努尔丁说，这个消息是不确实的，贾伊德·阿比丁根本不是伊斯兰教师联合会的党员。
