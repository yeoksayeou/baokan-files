    Reactions to Criticism

    Letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Health: We sincerely accept the criticism made by Comrade Feng Changqin in his article "A Letter of Criticism Unanswered for 300 Days," published in your newspaper on September 6th, which criticized us for not paying attention to people's letters. We have now urged the city's People's Committee to conduct on-site investigations and handle the matter.

    Letter from the Hailun County Public Housing Management Office: The article "Let's 'Manage It' After All" by Comrade Shi Ye in the People's Daily on August 24th criticized us for not addressing the housing requests of employees. Now, Comrade Dong from the Cultural Center has been found housing. We are determined to correct the shortcoming of not repairing houses in a timely manner in order to meet the housing needs of employees. However, two points need to be clarified: First, some employees are competing for good housing located near their workplaces, which has created some difficulties for us in arranging housing. Second, the article mentioned that "five good tile-roofed houses in Group 16 of 9th Street are left vacant" without repair. In fact, these houses were later demolished because they had no repair value.

    Letter from the Sichuan Branch of Xinhua Bookstore: After the publication of the article "'Hospitable' Host" on page four of the People's Daily on October 22nd, we conducted an inspection and study. We believe that there were extravagant and wasteful practices in our several dinners. This is mainly reflected in the large number of dinners and the overly broad scope of invitees. People who could be invited or not were invited.

专栏：对批评的反应

    对批评的反应
    江苏省卫生厅来信：9月6日你报刊登了冯昌勤同志的“一封批评信三百天无回音”，批评我们不重视人民来信，我们诚恳地接受这个批评。现在，我们已经督促该市人民委员会进行了实地调查处理。
    海伦县公有房地产管理处来信：人民日报8月24日石页同志的“还是‘管一管’吧”，批评我们对职工要求住房采取不理的态度。现在，文化馆姓董的同志，已经找到了住房。我们决心改正修理房屋不及时的缺点，以满足职工住房的需要。但有两点需要说明的：一是有些职工都争着想找好的、离工作地方近的住房，这给我们安排住房，造成了一定困难。另外，文中提到“九街十六组就空着五间很好的瓦房”没有修理，事实上，这些房因无修理价值，后来被拆掉了。
    新华书店四川分店来信：10月22日人民日报四版“‘好客’的主人”一文发表后，我们便进行了检查和研究。认为在我们的几次聚餐中，是有铺张浪费的情况存在的。这主要表现在聚餐的次数较多，被邀请者的范围也过于扩大，可请可不请的人也被请来了。
