    Buying Fish Based on Rank
    On December 28th last year, a small courtyard next to the Shangrao Prefectural Committee and Commissioner's Office canteen was selling fish, but there were more people looking at the fish than buying it. Why? Because there was a strange rule: only cadres at the section chief level and above could buy it; general cadres could not. So, everyone could only sigh longingly at the fish. One female comrade wanted to buy fish but was refused. She angrily brought her husband, and finally managed to buy it, because her husband was a section chief.
    Buying fish requires looking at rank; no wonder some people want to fight for status. (Fei Wo)

    买鱼看级别
    去年12月28日，上饶地委会和专署机关食堂旁一个小院子中正在买鱼，但看鱼的人比买鱼的人多。为什么呢？原来这里有个奇怪的规定，即科长级干部才能买，一般干部不能买，于是大家只好望鱼兴叹。一个女同志想买鱼被拒绝了，她生气地把自己的爱人找来，总算买到了，因为她爱人是科长。
    买鱼都要看级别，难怪有人要闹地位了。　　（非我）
