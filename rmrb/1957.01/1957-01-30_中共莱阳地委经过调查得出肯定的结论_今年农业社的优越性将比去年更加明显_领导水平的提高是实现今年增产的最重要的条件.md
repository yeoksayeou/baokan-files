Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 29th – Will the superiority of agricultural cooperation, as reflected in increased agricultural production, this year be comparable to the first year? The Shandong Province Laiyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, after in-depth investigation and research and convening a symposium with some agricultural cooperative directors, reached a positive conclusion: the superiority of agricultural cooperation will be more evident in the second year than in the first.

Regarding this question, cadres and farmers in the Laiyang Prefecture have different views. Some people believe that agricultural cooperation is a major transformation from the old to the new, and its superiority was bound to be more evident in the first year, but not in the second year. Others say that the "tricks" for increasing agricultural production were exhausted last year, and there are no new methods this year, so it will be difficult to increase production again; last year's natural conditions were very good, and it will be difficult to have such a good year again this year, so it would be good to maintain last year's production level. Therefore, some counties and agricultural cooperatives have formulated agricultural production plans for this year that are somewhat low. The Laiyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that whether this issue can be correctly understood will have a significant impact on this year's agricultural production increase. To this end, the person in charge of the Laiyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently conducted investigations and research in some agricultural cooperatives and convened a symposium with some agricultural cooperative directors to specifically discuss this issue.

The symposium comprehensively compared the conditions for increasing agricultural production this year and last year. The meeting believed that the methods for increasing agricultural production were not exhausted last year; even the methods that were used last year still have great potential that can be tapped and utilized this year. For example, many of last year's water conservancy projects have not been effective, and this year we can find ways to put them to good use. Intercropping was one of the most prominent measures for increasing production last year, but the area of intercropping only accounted for half of the area suitable for intercropping, and if we do well this year, we can intercrop all of it. The fertilizer accumulated from pig raising can also be greatly developed and improved in terms of quantity and quality this year compared to last year. In other aspects, such as soil improvement, there are also many measures that can be promoted this year. All of these will ensure that the yield per unit area of crops this year exceeds last year's level.

Regarding the issue of good or bad natural conditions, the symposium believed that last year was not a particularly good year, as wheat production was reduced due to excessive rain, and some autumn crops were also affected by floods; and the current situation this year is that the entire prefecture has had a good snowfall, and farmers say that a good wheat harvest is expected, and spring seedlings are also expected to emerge completely. Even if we encounter major natural disasters this year, farmers in the second year after agricultural cooperation will definitely have greater strength to resist disasters and strive for a good harvest than in the first year.

Finally, the symposium emphasized that when comparing the conditions for increasing production this year and last year, we must consider such a significant fact, that is, the leadership level and the management level of agricultural cooperatives have been greatly improved this year compared to last year. In the first year of agricultural cooperation, leaders at all levels and all rural work cadres lacked experience and had to explore one step, observe one step, and move forward one step, and sometimes had to rework. In terms of the management of agricultural cooperatives, last year, due to the sudden change in the scale of the cooperatives from small to large, many directors and production team leaders were not familiar with the nature of each plot of land, so that some lands were planted with unsuitable crops; they had no experience in the management and deployment of labor, resulting in many cases of wasted labor and rework. The symposium unanimously believed that all these shortcomings will be avoided in this year's work through the current rectification of the cooperatives. This is the most important condition for achieving increased production this year, which was not available last year.

Currently, the Laiyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is taking various measures to educate cadres and farmers to clarify that the great potential for agricultural production increase after agricultural cooperation will be tapped and utilized more and more each year, in order to unify understanding and formulate this year's production increase plan fully, actively and reliably.

    中共莱阳地委经过调查得出肯定的结论
    今年农业社的优越性将比去年更加明显
    领导水平的提高是实现今年增产的最重要的条件
    新华社济南29日电　今年农业合作化表现在农业增产上的优越性，能不能比得上第一年？中共山东省莱阳地方委员会经过深入调查研究和召集一部分农业社社长座谈以后，得出了肯定的结论：农业合作化的优越性在第二年将比第一年体现得更加明显。
    对于这个问题，莱阳专区的干部和农民有着不同的看法。一部分人认为，农业合作化是由旧变新的一次重大变革，它的优越性在第一年体现得比较明显是必然的，第二年就不行了。还有些人说，去年已经把农业增产的一些窍门挖遍了，用完了，今年没有什么新的办法，再要增产就很困难；去年的自然条件很好，今年恐怕难得再有那么个好年景，能保住去年的生产水平也就不错了。因此，有些县、农业社制定的今年的农业生产计划，都有偏低的现象。中共莱阳地方委员会认为，能否正确地认识这个问题，将对今年的农业增产发生重大的影响。为此，中共莱阳地方委员会的负责人最近到一些农业社里作了调查研究，并且召集一部分农业社社长，专门就这个问题举行了座谈会。
    座谈会全面地对比了今年和去年农业增产的条件。会议认为，农业增产的办法去年并没有用完；即使去年已经用过的办法，也还有很大的潜力今年可以加以挖掘利用。比如：去年的水利工程有不少没有发挥效用，今年就可以设法很好地运用起来。间作是去年增产的一项最突出的措施，可是实行间作的面积也只占宜于间作的面积的一半，今年做得好可以全部间作。养猪积得的肥料，在数量上和质量上，今年也还可以比去年大大发展和提高。其它如改良土壤等方面，今年也有很多措施可以推行。所有这些，都将保证今年农作物的单位面积产量超过去年的水平。
    至于自然条件好坏的问题，座谈会认为，去年并不是特别好的年景，小麦因雨多而减产，秋季作物也有一部分受了水灾；而今年当前的情况是，全专区已经普降瑞雪，农民说小麦丰收有望，春苗也可望出得齐全。就算今年将遇到较大的自然灾害，农民在农业合作化以后的第二年，定比第一年有更大的力量来抗拒灾害，争取丰收。
    最后，座谈会着重指出，在比较今年和去年的增产条件的时候，必须考虑到这样一个有重大意义的事实，即今年的领导水平和农业社的经营管理水平都比去年大大提高。在农业合作化的第一年，各级领导机关和所有农村工作干部都缺乏经验，不得不摸索一步，观察一步，前进一步，有时不得不返工另来。在农业社的经营管理上，去年由于社的规模一下子由小变大，不少社长和生产队长对于每块地的性质不熟悉，以致有些地上种的农作物不适宜，他们对于劳动力的管理调配没有经验，以致发生了很多窝工返工的现象等等。座谈会一致认为，所有这些缺点，通过目前的整社，将在今年的工作中得以避免。这是实现今年增产的最重要的条件，是去年所不具备的。
    目前，中共莱阳地方委员会正在采取各种方式教育干部和农民，弄清楚农业合作化以后农业增产的巨大潜力将一年比一年更多地被挖掘利用，以便统一认识，把今年的增产计划制定得充分积极而又可靠。
