Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 20th: According to a press communique released here on the 19th, Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, wrote to UN General Assembly President Nasrollah Entezam on January 17th, pointing out that as long as the West Irian issue remains unresolved, the territorial integrity of the Republic of Indonesia is violated, which constitutes a constant threat to the security of that country and the peace of the region. The letter demands the immediate adoption of a just and clear resolution recognizing West Irian as belonging to the Republic of Indonesia and demanding the withdrawal of Dutch troops from the region.

In another letter to Nasrollah Entezam, Louis Saillant expressed his hope that the Eleventh UN General Assembly would make a decisive contribution to the resolution of the Cyprus issue, in accordance with the wishes of the Cypriot workers and all the people.

Saillant demanded the implementation of the measures mentioned in the resolutions of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council meeting held in Sofia last September and October: immediate recognition of the Cypriot people's right to self-determination, cessation of persecution, and a demand that the British government immediately begin negotiations with the representatives of the Cypriot people.

    世界工联支持反殖民主义斗争
    要求联合国解决西伊里安和塞浦路斯问题
    据新华社布拉格20日电　据19日在这里发表的新闻公报说，世界工联总书记路易·赛扬1月17日写信给联合国大会主席那拉底，指出西伊里安问题一天不解决，印度尼西亚共和国的领土完整就受到侵犯，这就构成了对这个国家安全和世界这一地区的和平的经常威胁。这封信要求立即通过公正和明确的决议，承认西伊里安属于印度尼西亚共和国，并且要求荷兰部队撤出这个地区。
    路易·赛扬在另一封写给那拉底的信中，表示希望第十一届联合国大会根据塞浦路斯工人和全体人民的愿望，对塞浦路斯问题的解决做出有决定意义的贡献。
    赛扬要求实行去年9、10月间在索非亚召开的世界工联理事会会议决议中所提到的措施：立即承认塞浦路斯人民的自决权，停止迫害，并且要求英国政府立即与塞浦路斯人民的代表开始谈判。
