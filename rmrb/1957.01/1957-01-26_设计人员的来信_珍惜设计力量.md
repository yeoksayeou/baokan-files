    Designers' Letters
    Cherish the Power of Design
    After reading Comrade Zhang Zhi's letter "Improve the Conditions for Design Work" published in the People's Daily on November 9, 1956, we felt the same way; because the problems he raised are also very serious here.

    Our Fifth Design Branch of the Design Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry has been established for nearly four years. Over the past four years, this design unit has grown from small to large, developing into a large-scale design institution with nearly a thousand people. But in the past four years, how many results have we achieved? It is unbelievable to say that we have only produced two finished products, and only one factory with an investment of 10 million yuan belongs to the professional scope of our bureau.

    Is it that our design ability is particularly low, or that we are not working hard enough? No. Although our ability is not high, our enthusiasm is very high. In the past four years, according to the instructions of our superiors, we have completed nearly twenty preliminary designs, five technical designs, and three construction designs. These designs were all made under very tight conditions. However, these designs were scrapped in batches after they were made.

    Why were they scrapped? A few examples can illustrate this. A factory in Harbin, when the planning task book had not yet been fully considered and had not yet been approved, the superiors urged us to start immediately, repeatedly emphasizing how urgently the national economy needed it. Therefore, we invested a lot of manpower to collect original data; after the planning task book was approved, after three months of intensive work, we finally completed the entire preliminary design. But at this time, the leadership suddenly announced that "the investment plan has changed, and the construction of the factory will be stopped." In this way, a design achievement was put into the cold palace. Another example is a factory in Beijing. We not only completed the entire preliminary design and passed the approval, but also completed most of the technical design. The result was also "plan change," and all previous efforts were wasted. Especially for a factory in Tianjin, as soon as the planning task came down, it was extremely urgent. Three stages of design were compressed into two stages; two stages of design were compressed into one stage. Finally, after the day and night efforts of all the comrades, all the designs were completed, the construction drawings were also produced, and the factory had already started construction, but the plan suddenly changed again; until now, the construction drawings are still being revised. The only finished product we designed that was put into construction – the Beijing Automobile Accessories Factory – was also quite difficult to produce. The design of this factory started in 1953, and it was reworked several times in the middle due to changes in the plan. It was not until the beginning of 1955 that all the construction drawings were made, and just as construction was about to begin, a notice was received saying that the factory construction plan had to be changed. Therefore, construction was immediately stopped, and new construction drawings were rushed to be made, which not only caused waste but also affected the quality of the design.

    Some people say: "National plans are of great importance, and modifications are unavoidable for the sake of prudence." Of course, for various reasons, modifications to the plan are currently unavoidable. We only hope that the national construction departments can be more cautious and thorough in their consideration before deciding on design tasks. In this way, some rework and waste caused by subjective rash decisions can be avoided or reduced.

    At present, our country's design capabilities are still insufficient, far from meeting the needs of the country. Therefore, we should cherish the power of design even more. Some construction departments do not pay enough attention to the waste of design power. When we raise objections due to the scrapping of design documents, we often encounter such answers: "It doesn't matter, it's just paperwork anyway, it hasn't become a reality, just change it! Besides, the more it is changed, the more reasonable it becomes, and you can also use this to do another practice exercise!" What a costly "practice exercise"! In the past four years, the office expenses alone have been nearly 10 million yuan. This is only the tangible loss. As for intangible losses, such as affecting the quality of design due to rushing "tasks" without having time for in-depth research, and the difficulty of improving professional skills due to designing and drawing in the office and being divorced from reality, the losses are even more difficult to calculate.

### 设计人员的来信  珍惜设计力量

    设计人员的来信
    珍惜设计力量
    看了1956年11月9日人民日报所载张鋕同志的来信“改善设计工作的条件”以后，我们很有同感；因为他所提出的那些问题，在我们这里也很严重。
    我们第一机械工业部设计总局第五设计分局成立已经将近四年了。四年来，这个设计单位已经从小到大，发展成为近千人的大型设计机构。可是四年来，我们工作的成果有多少呢？说起来令人难以相信，我们只做出了两件成品，而属于我局专业范围的仅只一个投资一千万元的工厂。
    是不是我们的设计能力特别低，或者工作不努力呢？不是的。我们能力虽然不高，但热情却很高。四年来，我们根据上级指示，曾做了近二十个初步设计、五个技术设计、三个施工设计。这些设计都是在非常紧张的情况下做出来的。但是，这些设计做出来后却成批成批地报废了。
    为什么会报废呢？举几个例子就可以说明了。哈尔滨某厂，当计划任务书还没有考虑成熟和还没有被批准的时候，上级就催促我们立刻动手，一再强调国民经济如何迫切需要。于是，我们投入大量人力来搜集原始资料；计划任务书批准后，经过三个月的紧张劳动，终于完成了全部初步设计。但是此时，领导上突然宣布“投资计划改变，该厂停止建设”。这样，就把一个设计成果打入了冷宫。再如北京某厂，我们不但做完了全部初步设计并审批通过，而且还做了绝大部分的技术设计。结果也是“计划变更”，前功尽弃了。尤其是天津某厂，计划任务一下来，就火急万分。三段设计，压成两段；两段设计，又压成一段。最后经过全体同志日夜努力，全部设计都做好了，施工图也出来了，厂方也已开始施工，可是计划又突然变了；直到现在，还在修改施工图。就是我们设计的唯一付之施工的成品——北京汽车附件厂，也是相当难产的。这个厂从1953年开始设计，当中就因为计划变更返工了好几次，一直到1955年初做出了全部施工图后，正开始施工时，又接到通知，说建厂计划还要改变。于是，一面立刻停止施工，一面又匆匆忙忙赶做新的施工图，不但造成浪费，而且影响设计质量。
    有人说：“国家计划，事关重大，为慎重起见，免不了修改。”当然，目前由于种种原因，修改计划是免不了的。我们只希望国家建设部门在决定设计任务之前，能更慎重更周密地多多考虑。这样，就能够避免或减少一些由于主观草率决定而造成的返工和浪费。
    目前我们国家设计力量还很不足，远不能满足国家需要。因此，更应该珍惜设计力量。有些建设部门对设计力量的浪费是不够重视的。我们因设计文件报废而提出意见时，常常会碰到这样的回答：“没关系，反正还是纸面文章，没有成为事实，改就改吧！何况愈改愈合理，你们也可借此多作一次练习题！”代价多高的“练习题”啊！四年来，仅机关开支一项就近千万元。这只是有形损失。至于无形损失，如因赶“任务”无暇深入研究而影响设计质量，和坐在办公室设计画图而脱离实际难于提高业务水平等的损失，更是难于计算的。
