Wedding Postponed for the Second Time

　　Zhao Chunlie, Dian Ming

　　Jiao Wancai, a young driller at the Xinqiu Coal Mine in Fuxin, and Shao Yufen, a girl from his hometown village, had long planned to hold their wedding during the Spring Festival. As the joyous date drew nearer, Jiao Wancai's heart was filled with joy. On the afternoon of the 25th, Jiao Wancai arrived at the mine early, as usual, in high spirits, waiting to go on the night shift. He saw the general Party branch office packed with people. Jiao Wancai went inside and suddenly heard the director, the general Party branch secretary, and the production team leader discussing: Some factories and cities are waiting for coal to burn. If we don't take a holiday during the Spring Festival, our open-pit area can produce more than 4,000 tons of coal a day. This sudden conversation disrupted the young man's eager anticipation of his wedding. Jiao Wancai became somewhat hesitant.

　　Originally, Jiao Wancai and Shao Yufen had agreed to get married in the new year. At that time, because the mine's task was urgent, he voluntarily postponed the wedding to the Spring Festival. For this matter, half a month ago, his mother came to find him from her village more than a hundred miles away, asking him to definitely return home for the Spring Festival no matter what.

　　As Jiao Wancai walked towards the mine shaft, he thought: If I don't go home, will Yufen have any objections to the wedding being postponed again and again? If I go back, the country needs coal, how can I leave? But then he thought: In any case, producing coal is a national priority, and getting married is a personal matter. What's a few days' delay? As long as I write a letter to Yufen and explain things clearly, she will understand.

　　Unexpectedly, the next day, his elder brother Jiao Wanqing came from his hometown again. Jiao Wanqing was shocked to hear that his younger brother was not planning to go home for the Spring Festival again, and said, "There are so many people in the mine, what's the big deal if one or two of you are missing?"

　　"If one of me goes home, and another one goes home, then the mine doesn't have to produce anything," Jiao Wancai continued, and then told his brother that the country is waiting for coal, and without coal, the factories cannot produce, and where will we in the countryside buy things to use...?

　　Jiao Wanqing nodded as he listened, and a smile slowly appeared on his face. Before Jiao Wancai could finish speaking, he said, "Okay, I'll go home and talk to Mom and Shao Yufen. Don't worry, just concentrate on production!"

　　After listening to the story of this twice-postponed wedding next to the open-pit mine, the Party Secretary of the Xinqiu Coal Mine told the director and general Party branch secretary of the North Open-Pit Mine: "Marriage is also a major event. This young man is extraordinary. Quickly put up a blackboard bulletin to praise him. After the Spring Festival, be sure to give him a few days off to go back and get married."

　　Jiao Wancai's story quickly spread throughout the mine. People said: Other people's wives aren't in a rush to be married, why do we have to go home? Many people who had bought train tickets also refunded them. They will all work as usual during the Spring Festival holiday to produce more coal for the cities and factories. (Xinhua News Agency)

    婚礼二次延期
    赵春烈　电明
    阜新新丘煤矿青年打眼工人焦万财和家乡农村姑娘邵玉芬的婚礼，早就订好在春节举行，眼看着喜期一天比一天临近，焦万财心里乐得像开了一朵花。25日下午，焦万财又像往常一样地高高兴兴很早来到了矿上，等候上夜班，只见党总支办公室里坐得满满一屋子人。焦万财走进去，突然听到主任、党总支书记、生产队长在谈论着：现在有些工厂、城市都等着煤烧，如果春节不休假，咱们露天区一天就能生产四千多吨煤。这个突如其来的谈话，冲乱了这位年青人迎接婚期的热切的心，焦万财有些踌躇不安了。
    原来焦万财和邵玉芬曾经约定在新年结婚，当时因为矿山任务紧急，他就自动把婚期推延到春节。为了这事，半个月以前，妈妈从一百多里外的乡下来找他，让他春节无论如何一定得回去。
    焦万财一边往矿井里走一边想：不回家吧，婚礼一拖再拖，玉芬会不会有意见呢？回去吧，国家又需要煤，怎好离开哪？可是他又想：不管怎样，出煤总是国家大事，结婚是个人的事，延迟几天又有什么呢！只要给玉芬写封信，把事说清，她也会想通的。
    不料第二天，他的大哥焦万清又从家乡赶来了。焦万清一听说他弟弟春节又不准备回家了，大吃一惊，说道：“矿山这么多人，少你一个两个又怕什么呢？”
    “我一个回家，他一个回家，那矿山就不要生产了。”焦万财接着又告诉他哥哥，现在国家等着煤用，没有煤，工厂不能生产，咱们乡下使的用的东西上哪买去……。
    焦万清一边听一边点头，脸上慢慢地现出笑容，还没等焦万财说完就说：“好吧，我回家同妈妈和邵玉芬说去，你放心，好好生产吧！”
    新丘煤矿党委书记在露天矿坑旁听完了这个两次推迟婚礼的事以后，向北露天矿主任和党总支书记说：“结婚也是大事，这个小伙子不简单，赶快出黑板报表扬表扬，过了春节一定要给他几天假，让他回去结婚。”
    焦万财的事情很快传遍了全矿。人们都说：人家媳妇都不忙娶了，我们干么非得回家呢？很多买好车票的人把车票也退了。他们都要在春节假日里，照常上班，多生产一些煤供给城市和工厂。　（新华社）
