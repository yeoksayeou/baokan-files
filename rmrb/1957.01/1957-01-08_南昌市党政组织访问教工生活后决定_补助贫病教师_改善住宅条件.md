Following visits to the lives of faculty and staff, the Nanchang City Party and Government organizations decided to: Subsidize poor and sick teachers, improve housing conditions

(Our newspaper reports) To further implement the Party's policy towards intellectuals, improve leadership, and show concern for and improve the lives of faculty, staff, and their families, the Jiangxi Province and Nanchang City Party organizations and government invited relevant departments to form the "Nanchang City Faculty and Staff Family Visiting Group." From December 10th to 20th of last year, they conducted in-depth visits to the families of faculty and staff in various municipal schools, listening to their opinions.

The "Nanchang City Faculty and Staff Family Visiting Group" was divided into seven teams, covering middle schools, adult education, urban and suburban primary schools, etc. Ouyang Wu, the nearly eighty-year-old Vice Governor of Jiangxi Province, participated in the visits despite his illness. Lu Liang, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, Xu Deyiuan, Director of the Provincial Education Department, Ji Fumin, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Nanchang Municipal Party Committee, Wu Yingfu, Director of the Nanchang Municipal Education Bureau, and responsible comrades from relevant departments personally conducted in-depth visits, engaging in sincere conversations with faculty, staff, and their families.

Guo Guangzhou, Secretary of the Nanchang Municipal Party Committee, immediately discussed and resolved the issues raised by teachers with relevant parties; for those that could not be resolved, he patiently explained the situation to the teachers.

During the visits, the faculty, staff, and their families expressed their wishes and demands, and put forward many suggestions. The visiting group is currently studying these suggestions with relevant departments and will gradually resolve them based on needs and possibilities. Currently, the preliminary decisions that can be resolved are: first, allocate a batch of special funds for living subsidies for poor and sick teachers; in 1957, allocate 1,400 sets of desks and benches, 280 sets of single beds, and 80 sets of office desks to solve the equipment problems of suburban primary schools. Regarding housing issues, the following solutions will be adopted: 1. During the holidays, adjust dormitories that are far from the schools; 2. Allocate 2,000 public houses under the control of the Education Bureau for teachers to rent; 3. In the future, when building school buildings, appropriately add dormitories, and so on.

This visit greatly enhanced the socialist enthusiasm of the teachers. Teachers have expressed requests to the leadership, wanting to do more work and better cultivate talents for the motherland. Faculty and staff families have also pledged to do a good job in household affairs, allowing their loved ones to do their work well.

    南昌市党政组织访问教工生活后决定
    补助贫病教师　改善住宅条件
    本报讯　江西省和南昌市党组织和政府，为了进一步贯彻党对知识分子的政策，改进领导工作、关心和改善教工及其家属的生活，特邀请有关部门组成“南昌市教工家属访问团”，于去年12月10日至20日分别深入市级各类学校教工家属进行访问，倾听教工和家属的意见。
    “南昌市教工家属访问团”共分中学、业余教育、市区和郊区小学等七个队。年近八十岁的江西省副省长欧阳武，带病参加访问。中共江西省委文教部部长吕良、省教育厅厅长许德瑗、中共南昌市委文教部部长季夫民、南昌市教育局局长吴英俌和有关部门负责同志，都亲自深入访问，同教工及其家属作恳切交谈。
    中共南昌市委书记郭光洲对教师提出的问题，立即同有关方面研究解决；对不能解决的，就向教师耐心解释。
    访问期间，广大教工及其家属表达了他们的愿望和要求，提出了许多意见。对于这些意见，访问团正在同有关部门研究，根据需要和可能，逐步予以解决。目前，初步决定能解决的是：先拨一批专款作贫、病教师的生活补助费；1957年将拨一千四百套桌凳、二百八十套单人床和八十套办公桌，解决郊区小学设备问题。关于住宅问题，将采取下列解决办法：一、在假期调整距校远的宿舍；二、由教育局掌握的二千间公产房屋拨给教师租用；三、以后在盖校舍时适当加盖宿舍，等等。
   这次访问大大地提高了教师们的社会主义积极性。教师们纷纷向领导上提出要求，要作更多的工作，更好地为祖国培养人材。教工家属也纷纷保证搞好家务，让亲人做好工作。
