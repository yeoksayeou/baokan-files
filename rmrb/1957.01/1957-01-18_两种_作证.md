Title: Two Kinds of "Testimony"

    Recently, when U.S. Secretary of State Dulles testified before the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives regarding the "Eisenhower Doctrine," he strenuously emphasized that the purpose of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" was not to subvert the governments of Middle Eastern countries, but to provide them with "sufficient protection against internal subversion that they can have." He swore that the United States would never "invade any country to overthrow its government, no matter how that government came to power."
    But, who can be fooled by this "hypocritical denial"?
    Speaking of subversive activities, the people of the Middle East have plenty of painful memories of the United States. There are few countries where Allen Dulles's men have not engaged in nefarious activities. Take Syria, for example. In 1949 alone, there were three armed coups, two of which were instigated by the United States. If the past cannot explain the United States' policy today, there is no shortage of fresh examples.
    The conspirators who were tried a few days ago in Syria for attempting to launch an armed coup confessed that they had close ties with "Americans in Beirut." One of the conspirators, Syrian parliamentarian and former minister Munir al-Ajlani, said that the United States was using money in Syria in the name of "resisting communism" to carry out conspiracies, with the aim of interfering in Syria's internal affairs.
    The lackey accused the master. The Syrian conspirators' "testimony" in the military court exposed the ridiculous face of the U.S. Secretary of State.
    Moreover, U.S. news agencies' propaganda also contains quite a bit of "testimony" to Dulles' hypocrisy. A dispatch from Washington by the United Press on January 7 revealed that the purpose of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" was to encourage anti-communists in Syria, Egypt, and other countries. Encourage them to do what? The United Press reporter did not say it outright, but he revealed that Washington was uneasy about the political developments in countries like Syria because it had "leaned to the left." And everyone knows what the U.S. ruling group wants to do when it believes that a country's government does not suit its taste.
    The "testimony" of the Syrian conspirators and the United Press proves that the United States not only has plotted subversive activities, but also attempts to continue to engage in such criminal activities. This cannot be concealed by Dulles' rhetoric.

### 两种“作证”

    两种“作证”
    最近美国国务卿杜勒斯在美国参众两院为“艾森豪威尔主义”作证的时候，都竭力强调“艾森豪威尔主义”的目的不是要去颠覆中东国家的政府，而是提供他们
  “所能够有的对付内部颠覆的足够保护”。他赌咒发誓地保证：美国决不会“入侵任何国家去推翻其政府，不管这个政府是怎样上台的”。
    但是，这种“此地无银三百两”的表白骗得了谁呢？
    说到颠覆活动，中东各国人民对美国有着够多的惨痛的回忆。很少的国家，艾伦·杜勒斯的手下没有在那里进行过罪恶的活动。拿叙利亚来说，1949年一年中发生三次武装政变，就有两次是美国所策动的。如果说，过去的事情，不能够说明美国今天的政策，那末新鲜的例子也并不缺乏。
    前几天在叙利亚企图发动武装政变而受审判的阴谋分子供认，“在贝鲁特的美国人”同他们有密切的联系。阴谋分子之一的叙利亚议员和前部长穆尼尔·阿吉拉尼说：美国在“抵抗共产主义”的名义下，使用金钱在叙利亚进行阴谋活动，目的是要干涉叙利亚的内政。
    奴才控告了主子。叙利亚的阴谋分子在军事法庭上的“作证”，揭穿了美国国务卿的可笑的面目。
    不仅如此，就在美国通讯社的宣传中也颇不乏对杜勒斯的伪善的“证词”。合众社1月7日从华盛顿发出的一则电讯，就揭露说：“艾森豪威尔主义”的目的就是要鼓励叙利亚、埃及和其他国家的反共分子。鼓励他们干什么呢？合众社记者并没有说穿，但是他透露说：华盛顿方面对于像叙利亚这样的国家的政局发展感到不安，因为它“左倾了”。而谁都知道，当美国统治集团认为那一个国家的政府不合它的口味的时候，它想做的是什么事情。
    叙利亚的阴谋分子和合众社的“证词”，证明了美国不但曾经策划颠覆活动，而且还企图继续干这种罪恶勾当。这是杜勒斯的花言巧语所掩盖不了的。
