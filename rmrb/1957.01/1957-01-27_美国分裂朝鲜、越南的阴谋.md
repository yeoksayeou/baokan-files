In the Special Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, the United States, colluding with some countries, put forward two proposals requesting the Security Council to consider the issue of South Korea and South Vietnam joining the United Nations. This is another conspiratorial step by the United States, disregarding the wishes of the Korean and Vietnamese people for peaceful reunification, and attempting to permanently divide Korea and Vietnam.

The South Korean authorities are a terrorist regime imposed on a portion of the Korean people by relying on the guns of the United States, and the South Vietnamese authorities cannot exist without the protection of the United States. They cannot represent the Korean people and the Vietnamese people at all. Therefore, their unilateral applications to join the United Nations are illegal. The United States' attempt to bring South Korea and South Vietnam into the United Nations separately is its intention to continue obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean and Vietnamese issues, and to continue dividing Korea and Vietnam in order to occupy South Korea and South Vietnam for a long time. This proposal by the United States not only violates the national interests of the Korean and Vietnamese people but is also detrimental to peace in the Far East.

The United Nations has discussed the Korean issue countless times. Facts have proven that the Korean issue can only be resolved reasonably in accordance with the national will of the Korean people and the interests of world peace and security. Any attempt to use the United Nations to take unilateral measures is futile. The United Nations cannot unilaterally deal with the Korean issue, nor can it unilaterally decide who should be the "representative" of the Korean people. As for the Vietnamese issue, the Geneva Accords have clearly stipulated the steps for achieving peaceful reunification; before peaceful reunification is achieved, unilaterally pulling South Vietnam into the United Nations will only create difficulties in the implementation of the Geneva Accords and be detrimental to peace in Indochina.

In view of the current situation in Korea and Vietnam, the Soviet representative put forward another proposal in the Special Political Committee, requesting the admission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the United Nations, while also admitting South Korea and South Vietnam. This proposal, as a transitional measure before the realization of peaceful reunification in Korea and Vietnam, is fair and reasonable, because it can enable the Korean and Vietnamese people to obtain due representation in the United Nations, and can promote contact and consultation between the North and South of Korea and between the North and South of Vietnam in order to seek peaceful reunification. If the United Nations Special Political Committee is seeking a reasonable solution to the Korean and Vietnamese issues, it should accept the Soviet proposal and reject the US proposal.

However, it is seen that the United States' proposal to unilaterally admit South Korea and South Vietnam to the United Nations this time is not to solve the issue of representation in Korea and Vietnam, but only one of the conspiratorial steps to create tension in all aspects. Since the United States put forward the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" to prepare for armed aggression against the Middle East, it has recently announced that it will establish atomic war bases on the territory of many countries, threatening the world with atomic war. In Korea, it instructed the Syngman Rhee clique to continue clamoring for "northward advance," and the South Korean "parliament" even openly passed a resolution demanding the "abolition" of the Korean Armistice Agreement. In Vietnam, the United States continues to support the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in resisting the implementation of the Geneva Accords and constantly carries out provocative activities on the edge of the demilitarized zone. The US proposal in the United Nations is clearly to encourage the Syngman Rhee and Ngo Dinh Diem cliques to carry out anti-peace activities. Now, the Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have issued statements firmly opposing any attempt to unilaterally bring South Korea and South Vietnam into the United Nations. The Chinese people fully support the solemn position of the governments of Korea and Vietnam and demand that the Special Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly reject the unreasonable proposal of the United States and accept the reasonable proposal put forward by the Soviet Union.

### 美国分裂朝鲜、越南的阴谋

    美国分裂朝鲜、越南的阴谋
    在联合国大会特别政治委员会会议上，美国纠合一些国家提出了两个提案，要求安全理事会考虑南朝鲜和南越加入联合国的问题。这是美国不顾朝鲜、越南人民要求和平统一的愿望，企图长期分裂朝鲜和越南的又一个阴谋步骤。
    南朝鲜当局是依靠美国的枪杆子而强加在一部分朝鲜人民头上的恐怖政权，南越当局也不能离开美国的卵翼而存在。它们完全不能代表朝鲜人民和越南人民。因此，它们片面要求加入联合国的申请，都是不合法的。美国想要把南朝鲜和南越单独弄进联合国去，是它要继续阻挠朝鲜问题和越南问题的和平解决，继续分裂朝鲜和越南，以便长期占领南朝鲜和南越。美国的这个提案，不但违反朝鲜人民和越南人民的民族利益，并且有害于远东的和平。
    联合国讨论朝鲜问题已经不知多少次了，事实证明，朝鲜问题只能按照朝鲜人民的民族意志和全世界和平和安全的利益来求得合理的解决，任何企图利用联合国采取片面措施的行动都是徒劳无益的。联合国不能片面地处理朝鲜问题，也不能片面决定谁来作为朝鲜人民的“代表”。至于越南问题，日内瓦协议已经明文规定了实现和平统一的步骤；在和平统一没有实现以前，片面地要把南越拉进联合国里去，只会造成日内瓦协议实施的困难，有害于印度支那的和平。
    鉴于朝鲜和越南目前的形势，苏联代表在特别政治委员会提出了另一个提案，要求接纳朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国参加联合国，同时也接纳南朝鲜和南越。这个提案，作为在朝鲜和越南实现和平统一以前的一个过渡的办法，是公平合理的，因为它可以使朝鲜人民和越南人民在联合国取得应有的代表权，而且可以促进朝鲜南北双方之间和越南南北双方之间的接触和协商，以便求得和平统一。联合国特别政治委员会如果是为了寻求朝鲜问题和越南问题的合理解决，那就应当接受苏联的提案而拒绝美国的提案。
    但是，人们看到，美国这次提出要求联合国片面接纳南朝鲜和南越的提案，并不是为了解决朝鲜和越南的代表权问题，而只是配合它目前在各个方面制造紧张局势的阴谋步骤之一。自从美国提出准备武装侵略中东的所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”之后，最近它又宣布将在许多国家的领土上建立原子战争基地，对全世界进行原子战争的威胁。在朝鲜，它指使李承晚集团继续叫嚣“北进”，南朝鲜“议会”甚至公然通过了要求“废除”朝鲜停战协定的决议。在越南，美国继续支持吴庭艳集团抗拒履行日内瓦协议，并在非军事区边缘不断地进行挑衅活动。美国在联合国的提案，显然只是为了鼓励李承晚和吴庭艳集团进行反和平的活动。现在，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相和越南民主共和国外交部长都发表了声明，坚决反对要使南朝鲜和南越片面加入联合国的任何企图。中国人民完全支持朝鲜和越南两国政府的严正立场，要求联合国大会特别政治委员会摈斥美国的无理提案，接受苏联提出的合理的建议。
