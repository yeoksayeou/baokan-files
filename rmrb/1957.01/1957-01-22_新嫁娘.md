	The New Bride

	It is the season for harvesting cotton. The cotton fields on the left bank of the Yingjiang River are full of white cotton. When the wind blows along the riverbank, the white cotton gently sways....
	From afar, I saw the Jingpo ethnic girls from the cooperative, wearing colorful patterned tube skirts, busily picking cotton.
	I walked towards the cotton field, hoping to see the girl, Ma Yun. She is our production team leader. Because she led the team to good production, two months ago, when I went to Kunming, the cooperative chairman, Le Banno, specifically asked me to bring back a necklace as a reward from the cooperative committee for her.
	"Where did Ma Yun go?" I asked Chairman Le Banno, who was carrying a hoe and walking towards me.
	"She got married," Le Banno replied coldly.
	This surprised me. Two months ago, when I was about to leave the cooperative, the cooperative was preparing to recommend Ma Yun to the county for further study! Who would have thought she would suddenly get married! I quickly asked which village she had married into. He replied:
	"The Shanshang Potou Village."
	Then I remembered: a young man with dark skin had often come down from the mountains to find Ma Yun a few days ago. Several evenings, when I returned from a meeting in a distant village, I heard Ma Yun's joyous singing in the bamboo forest; I also often saw other girls teasing Ma Yun about her newly made purple-red skirt, giggling and saying that the skirt was given to her by "that person"...
	Le Banno and I slowly walked towards the village. Le Banno frowned and said fiercely, "Ma Yun is the dumbest girl in our village! We have so many young men in our cooperative, why does she have to marry someone from the mountains? What's so good about the mountains! There isn't even a mutual aid group."
	I couldn't help but laugh: "You, as the chairman, how can you interfere in the marriage of young people?"
	He argued, "I didn't interfere with her freedom! I'm just saying she's dumb! Okay, even if she likes the young man from the mountains! Why doesn't she ask that young man to join our cooperative?"
	"Haha! You, the chairman, are really chauvinistic."
	Le Banno shook his head and said with a sigh, "It's not that I'm selfish, it's just that it's hard to find a girl as diligent and capable as her elsewhere!"
	One evening, Chairman Le Banno suddenly ran to me with a smile on his face: "I have good news for you: Ma Yun is back."
	"Her husband is here too?"
	"No, just her alone."
	I was a little unconvinced and threw on a coat and ran to Ma Yun's brother's house.
	When I entered the low bamboo house, the siblings were sitting around the fire pit talking! Ma Yun was still wearing that purple-red skirt, and her beautiful face was a little thinner than before she got married. There was also a hint of melancholy in her bright eyes. She didn't look, not at all like a newlywed bride in happy marriage.
	Her brother saw us and shouted, "Look at the strange temper of my sister! Her husband didn't beat her, and the people of Potou Village didn't dare to bully her, but she insisted that the mountains were not good and ran back alone."
	The girl's character was still so stubborn, pouting and saying, "What's so strange about it? Didn't I say, there's no cooperative organization on the mountain, and I can't get used to living there!"
	She pleaded with me for help, "In the cooperative, everyone is used to working together. It's really hard to get used to living in the mountains! It's really backward there..."
	"Backward?" Her brother grumbled dissatisfiedly: "When we didn't have a cooperative a few years ago, wasn't it the same as that?"
	I was afraid that the siblings would quarrel again, so I quickly persuaded them, "Okay, okay, it's good to come back to the cooperative for a few days, does your husband agree?"
	She smiled shyly: "It was because he saw me frowning all day long that he agreed to me coming home."
	I remembered Le Banno's idea and casually asked, "Why don't you ask your husband to come down the mountain as well? It would be great if you joined the cooperative together."
	She shook her head with a wry smile: "Him? He won't. He said he wouldn't tug on his wife's skirt and follow behind."
	Ma Yun went back to work in the cooperative as usual. Chairman Le Banno was so happy that he forgot that he had once scolded Ma Yun as the dumbest girl in their Jingpo ethnic group. He praised her all day long when he saw people: "Ma Yun is a capable and sensible girl..."
	I also consciously reminded him: "Chairman, aren't you afraid that her husband will come and take her back to Potou Village?"
	He said nonchalantly, "I'm not afraid of that. I'm trying to persuade that young man to come down the mountain and join the cooperative!"
	After that, I often saw Le Banno asking people who came down the mountain to go to the market to send a message in an earnest tone, inviting Ma Yun's husband to live in the cooperative; sometimes he even personally took a bamboo tube of wine up the mountain to act as a "lobbyist."
	However, Le Banno's wishes were not so easy to realize. One afternoon in May, Ma Yun suddenly said goodbye to me with a small package in her arms. She pointed to the young Jingpo man behind her and said, "He's here to take me back!"
	The young man seemed to see through my questioning gaze and quickly stepped forward to explain to me: "We have also established a cooperative on the mountain, so I came to take her back!"
	Ma Yun was turning sideways, looking reluctantly at the lush green rice paddies in the distance, and the cotton fields and coffee fields that had consumed a lot of her efforts....
	I shook hands with Ma Yun and comforted her, "Ma Yun, go back to the mountain! Go help them set up a cooperative and tell them all the experiences we have here..."
	Ma Yun happily said goodbye to us and left affectionately with her husband.
	They walked away, disappearing into the bamboo forest in the distance. Chairman Le Banno was still standing there in a daze. After a while, he suddenly clenched his fist and waved it vigorously, saying to the young men standing next to him, "Okay, let her go! When their cooperative is well established, you all go and marry the most capable girls in their cooperative."

    新嫁娘
    彭荆风
    是收获棉花的季节了，盈江左岸的棉田里都结满了白色的棉花；风顺着江岸吹来，那白色的棉花就会轻轻地摇漾着……。
    我远远地就看到了合作社的景颇族姑娘们，她们穿着彩色花纹的统裙，正在忙着摘棉花。
    我往棉田走去，很希望能看到玛云姑娘。她是我们的生产组长。因为她领导那个组生产得好，两个月前，我去昆明时，社长勒般诺还特意要我带一条项链回来，作为社务委员会对她的奖励。
    “玛云到哪里去了？”我向正扛了一把锄头迎面走来的勒般诺社长问道。
    “她出嫁了。”勒般诺冷淡地回答我。
    这可叫我感到惊讶了。两个月前，我要离开社里的时候，社里还准备把玛云保送到县上去学习呢！谁想到她会突然出嫁了！我忙问她嫁到哪个寨子去了。他回答：
    “山上坡头寨。”
    我这才想起来：前些日子常有个皮肤黝黑的年轻人从山上下来找玛云。有好几个晚上，我从远处村寨开会回来，还听到那竹林里有着玛云的喜悦歌声；我也时常看到别的姑娘们指着玛云那条新制的紫红色裙子打趣，嘻嘻哈哈地说这裙子是“那个人”送给她的……。
    我和勒般诺缓慢地走向寨子里去。勒般诺皱着眉头狠狠地说：“玛云，是我们寨子里最蠢的姑娘！咱们社里有这么多小伙子，为什么偏要嫁一个山上的人？山上有什么好！连个互助组都没有。”
    我不禁笑了：“你这个社长，怎么干涉年轻人的婚事了？”
    他辩解地嚷着：“我没有干涉她的自由嘛！我是说她蠢呀！好，就算她喜欢山上的那个小伙子吧！她为什么不叫那个小伙子一起参加我们合作社？”
    “哈哈！你这社长真是够本位主义了。”
    勒般诺却摇了摇头，叹息地说道：“不是我自私，确实是她这种又勤快又能干的姑娘别处难找呵！”
    有天黄昏，勒般诺社长突然满脸笑容地跑来找我：“告诉你一个好消息：玛云回来了。”
    “她的丈夫也来了？”
    “不，只是她一个人。”
    我有些不大相信，披了一件衣服就往玛云的哥哥家跑去。
    我走进那低矮的小竹楼里时，他们兄妹俩正围在火塘前谈话呢！玛云还是穿着那条紫红色的裙子，美丽的脸庞也比出嫁前瘦削了一些，那对明亮的大眼睛里也微含着一些忧郁的神色。不像，很不像一个正在幸福的新婚中的新嫁娘。
    她哥哥见了我们就嚷道：“你看我这妹子的脾气怪不怪？汉子没有打她，坡头寨的人也没敢欺侮她，她却硬说山上不好，一个人跑回来了。”
    姑娘的性格仍然是那样倔强，噘着嘴说：“有什么古怪的？我不是说过了，山上没有组织合作社，我住不惯嘛！”
    她向我求援似地诉说着：“在合作社里，大伙在一起劳动惯了，到了山上真是过不惯呀！那里真落后呀……”
    “落后？”她哥哥不满意地嘟哝着：“我们前几年没有办合作社时，还不是和那一样。”
    我怕她们兄妹俩又会吵起来，赶紧解劝地说道：“好了，好了，回社里来住几天也好，你丈夫同意么？”
    她羞怯地笑了：“就是他看到我整天皱着眉头，才答应我回家来的。”
    我又想起了勒般诺的那个主意，就顺口问道：“为什么不把你丈夫也叫下山来，你们一起参加合作社那多好。”
    她苦笑地摇摇头：“他呀，他不肯。他说，他才不扯着婆娘的裙子，跟在后边走呢！”
    玛云又照旧参加了社内的劳动。勒般诺社长高兴得不行，也忘了曾经对着我骂过玛云是他们景颇族里最蠢的姑娘。整天见了人就夸奖：“玛云可是个又能干又懂事的姑娘呀……。”
    我也有意识地提醒他：“社长，你不怕她丈夫来把她接回坡头寨去么？”
    他却满不在乎地说道：“这个我可不怕。我正在想办法说服那个小伙子也下山来参加合作社呢！”
    这以后，我时常看到勒般诺带着殷勤的口吻托下山来赶街子的人捎个口信去请玛云的丈夫来社里住；有时还亲自带一竹筒酒上山去作“说客”。
    可是，勒般诺的愿望并不是那样容易实现。五月间的一个下午，玛云突然挟着个小包袱来向我辞行了。她指着那个跟在她背后的年轻的景颇人说道：“他来接我回去呢！”
    那位小伙子好像看透了我那带着询问口吻的眼神，赶紧走上前来向我说明：“是我们山上也建社了，我才来接她回去呢！”
    玛云正侧着身子留恋地望着远处那长得一片葱绿的秧田，以及那耗费了她不少心血的棉田和咖啡地……。
    我和玛云握了握手，安慰她道：“玛云，还是回山上去吧！去帮他们办社，把我们这里的经验都告诉他们……。”
    玛云这才高兴地和我们道别，亲热地和她丈夫走了。
    她们走远了，消失在远处的竹林里了，勒般诺社长还站在那里发呆。过了好一会，他突然握着拳头用力一挥，对站在旁边的那些小伙子说道：“好，就让她走吧！等她们的社办好了，你们都去，去把他们社里最能干的姑娘都娶回来。”
