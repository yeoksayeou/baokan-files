Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 25th: The "Indonesian Torch" reported today that some leaders of the Masyumi Party have recently been working to win over some officers in Jakarta, asking them to help the Masyumi Party overthrow the current cabinet.

    An officer who had been contacted by members of the Masyumi Party told a reporter from the "Indonesian Torch" that the officers had rejected the Masyumi Party's lobbying, believing that following the Masyumi Party to overthrow the government would be a violation of their duties as officers.

    The newspaper said that the Indonesian Islamic Youth League of the Masyumi Party had also sent representatives to lobby the Ansor Youth Group of the Islamic Teachers Association not long ago, asking them to urge the Central Committee of the Islamic Teachers Association to make decisions that conformed to the wishes of the Masyumi Party, but they were also rejected.

    马斯友美党不识时务
    倒阁活动到处碰壁
    据新华社雅加达25日电　“印度尼西亚火炬报”今天说，马斯友美党的若干领袖最近致力于拉拢雅加达的一些军官，要求他们协助马斯友美党推翻现内阁。
    曾经同马斯友美党人士接触过的一个军官告诉“印度尼西亚火炬报”记者说，军官们已经拒绝了马斯友美党的游说，他们认为跟随马斯友美党推翻政府是违反军官职责的。
    报纸说，马斯友美党的印度尼西亚伊斯兰青年团不久以前也曾经派代表游说伊斯兰教师联合会的安索青年团，要他们促请伊斯兰教师联合会中央委员会采取符合于马斯友美党愿望的决定，但是也遭到了拒绝。
