Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 21st (Xinhua News Agency reporter Qu Yifan, Tian Zhuang report): The winter production movement in rural Hubei Province has been fully launched and is better than any previous year. The characteristics are: well-developed production plans, well-arranged labor, simultaneous development of agriculture and sideline occupations, high labor efficiency of agricultural cooperative members, and high quality of production work.

Since the autumn of 1956, most areas of Hubei Province have not had a thorough rain for three or four months. Agricultural cooperatives in various places organized their members not only to draw and carry water to fight drought and overfulfilled the winter sowing plan on schedule, but also to grasp field management work after the emergence of crops, so that most of the farmland was weeded and fertilized. In previous years, the fields were a dark brown color at this time; this year, the seedlings in the fields are complete and strong, almost everywhere is green. A heavy snow fell these days, which is very beneficial to the crops. So far, the amount of fertilizer accumulated in the province has reached about half of the winter and spring fertilizer accumulation plan, and the quality of the fertilizer is better than last year. The completed farmland water conservancy projects in various places have generally reached about 20% to 30% of the planned requirements. Due to the training of farmer water conservancy technicians and the establishment of water conservancy technical guidance groups or roving inspection stations, most of the newly built farmland water conservancy projects are both good and economical. Sideline production and animal husbandry production in rural areas have also been developed. According to statistics from twenty counties including Xiangyang, Gucheng, and Tianmen, sideline production alone has generated more than 28 million yuan in income since the beginning of winter, with an average increase of more than 20 yuan per household. Most of the original production-reduction cooperatives in these counties have now become production-increasing or production-maintaining cooperatives.

In 1955, the winter production in rural Hubei Province achieved great results because it was in the high tide of agricultural cooperativization and the farmers' production enthusiasm was very high, laying the foundation for the bumper harvest in 1956. However, at that time, many agricultural cooperatives had just been established and lacked experience in operation and management. They only emphasized agricultural production and neglected sideline occupations and other diversified operations; they only emphasized collective action and neglected flexible division of labor; they only pursued lively scenes (such as digging pond mud and repairing roads with gas lamps at night), and did not pay enough attention to work quality and work efficiency. In the winter production of 1956, agricultural cooperatives in various places carried forward the successful experience of the winter production of 1955 and accepted the lessons of the failure of the winter production of 1955. Agricultural cooperatives in various places generally formulated comprehensive plans for winter agricultural and sideline production, and, according to the extensive and scattered nature of winter production content, specifically arranged labor, rationally adjusted labor quotas, implemented the production responsibility system, and paid attention to resolving the contradiction between public and private work. The fourteen agricultural cooperatives in Jingbei Township, Jiangling County, stipulated that members should be arranged to work five or six days for the cooperative every seven days in winter, and the rest of the time would be at the disposal of the members themselves. Therefore, the members were very motivated; not only was the cooperative's production fast and good, but also the members' household sideline occupations were very active. After most agricultural cooperatives in Yichang Prefecture implemented the household management responsibility system for overwintering crops, the members paid great attention to managing the overwintering crops they were responsible for. Most of the paddy fields in Xiaogan County have been plowed, and the rice roots in the fields have also been picked up. The overwintering stem borer rate of about 20% in this county in previous years has now dropped to 5%.

Leading cadres at all levels in Hubei Province went deep into the countryside, strengthened leadership, and promoted the winter production movement. Before the New Year, the winter production in Hongan County progressed slowly; therefore, Cheng Peng, secretary of the Hongan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and other leading cadres went to townships and cooperatives to help formulate plans and participate in production together with the members, and quickly changed the face of winter production in the county. Zhao Jinliang, deputy secretary of the Macheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China, went to Chengxi Township and carried pond mud together with the members, which greatly encouraged the members. The Feiben Agricultural Cooperative in this township originally had only more than 60 people carrying pond mud, but later increased to 450 people, accumulating 200,000 loads of fertilizer in ten days. Under the influence of the county leading cadres, many township and cooperative cadres also participated in production and led production, making the winter production movement lively and colorful.

### 湖北农村冬季生产成绩空前  计划订得周到　劳力安排得好  生产进度又快　工作质量又高

    湖北农村冬季生产成绩空前
    计划订得周到　劳力安排得好  生产进度又快　工作质量又高
    新华社武汉21日电　新华社记者曲一凡、田庄报道：湖北省农村的冬季生产运动已经全面地开展起来，而且比以往任何一年都好。特点是：生产计划搞得好，劳动力安排得好，农业、副业同时发展，农业社社员们的劳动效率高，生产工作质量高。
    1956年秋季以来，湖北省大部地区三、四个月没有下过透雨。各地农业社组织社员们不仅车水、挑水抗旱，按期超额完成了冬播计划，而且在农作物出苗以后抓紧田间管理工作，使大部分农田除了草，追了肥。往年这个时候，田里是一片黑黝黝的土色；今年田里苗儿又齐全又茁壮，几乎到处都是一片青。这几天，下了一场大雪，对农作物很有好处。到目前为止，全省积下的肥料已经达到冬、春两季积肥计划的一半左右，特别是肥料的质量比去年好。各地已经完工的农田水利工程，一般也达到计划要求的20％到30％左右。由于训练了农民水利技术员，成立了水利技术指导组或巡回检查站，新修的农田水利工程大多又好又省。农村中副业生产和畜牧业生产也都得到了发展。据襄阳、谷城、天门等二十个县的统计，入冬以来，仅副业生产一项就收入两千八百多万元，平均每户社员增加收入二十多元。这些县原来的一些减产社，现在绝大多数变成了增产社或保产社。
    1955年湖北省农村的冬季生产因为处在农业合作化高潮之中，农民生产情绪很高，所以取得了很大的成绩，为1956年的丰收奠定了基础。但是，当时许多农业社刚成立，经营管理经验不足，只强调了农业生产，忽视了副业及其他多种经营；只强调了集体行动，忽视了灵活分工；光追求轰轰烈烈的场面（如夜间点汽灯挖塘泥、修马路等），对于工作质量和工作效率注意不够。1956年的冬季生产中，各地农业社就发扬了1955年冬季生产的成功经验，接受了1955年冬季生产的失败教训。各地农业社普遍订出冬季农、副业生产的全面规划，并且根据冬季生产内容广泛、活路分散的情况，具体地安排劳动力，合理地调整劳动定额，推行生产责任制，以及注意解决公私活路的矛盾。江陵县荆北乡十四个农业社规定，冬季每七天安排社员给社做五天或六天活路，其余时间由社员自己支配。因此，社员的劲头很足；不仅社里的生产搞得又快又好，而且社员的家庭副业也很活跃。宜昌专区大部分农业社对越冬农作物实行分户管理责任制以后，社员们都很注意管理好自己负责的越冬农作物。孝感县大部分的稻田已经翻耕，田里的谷兜也拣光了，这个县历年来20％左右的越冬螟虫率，现已下降到5％。
    湖北省各地领导干部深入农村，加强领导，推动了冬季生产运动。新年前，红安县冬季生产进展较慢；于是，中共红安县委员会书记程鹏等领导干部分头深入乡、社，帮助制定计划，并且同社员一起参加生产，迅速改变了全县冬季生产的面貌。中共麻城县委员会副书记赵金良到城西乡，同社员一块挑塘泥，对社员鼓舞很大。这个乡的飞奔农业社原来挑塘泥的只有六十多人，后来增加到四百五十人，十天时间积肥二十万担。各地在县领导干部的影响下，许多乡、社干部也纷纷参加生产，领导生产，使冬季生产运动有声有色地开展起来。
