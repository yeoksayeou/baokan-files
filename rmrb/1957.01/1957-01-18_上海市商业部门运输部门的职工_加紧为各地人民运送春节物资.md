Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Electric News: Workers in Shanghai's commercial and transportation departments are working together to ensure that the supplies for people in urban and rural areas across the country to celebrate the Spring Festival are delivered by the 20th.

　　In the first half of January, the various procurement and supply stations under the Shanghai Third Commercial Bureau had already shipped about 40,000 tons of cotton cloth, department store goods, and other daily necessities. On the 15th, despite heavy snow all day, the stations and docks persisted in loading goods and shipped out thousands of tons of various holiday supplies. The relevant state-owned commercial units are now open on Sundays to handle manufacturer deliveries, in order to speed up the transfer work.

　　This year, in addition to bulk commodities such as clothing fabrics, clothing, sugar, kerosene, and cigarettes, Shanghai's Spring Festival supplies also include a large number of small commodities suitable for rural needs.

    加紧为各地人民运送春节物资
    据新华社上海电　上海市商业部门和运输部门的职工正共同努力，争取在20日前把供应全国城乡人民欢度春节用的物资运送完毕。
    在1月份上半月内，上海市第三商业局所属各采购供应站已经运出棉布、百货等日用品四万吨左右。15日整天大雪纷飞，各车站、码头仍然坚持装货，运出各种节日用品上千吨。各有关国营商业单位现在星期日照常办理厂商进货，以加快调运工作。
    今年上海供应的春节物资，除了衣料、服装、食糖、煤油、卷烟等大宗商品以外，还有大量适合农村需要的小商品。
