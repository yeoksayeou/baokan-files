    Actually, It's Still Egalitarianism
    In September of last year, the South-Central Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Geology issued a notice regarding "Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Field Equipment." The notice stipulated that some field geological exploration personnel would receive a raincoat and rain pants each year, while others would receive a set every two or three years. Rubber boots, like raincoats, also had different service life limits based on different types of work. The notice also emphasized the need to strictly implement this regulation to prevent the tendency of egalitarianism.
    This method of distributing raincoats and rubber boots based on different types of work and specifying usage years seems reasonable at first glance. However, it is not. Because geological exploration teams are distributed in various locations, the climates and geological conditions vary. Some places have more rain, others less; some projects can proceed regardless of the weather, while others cannot be carried out in rainy weather even with raincoats and rubber boots. For example, our Team 419 mainly uses trench exploration and well exploration methods. There is no standing water in the trenches and wells at our work site, and the soil is dry. Rubber boots are not needed at all on sunny days; and when it rains, open-air operations are impossible. Therefore, the rubber boots issued to the well exploration workers here, except for a few who occasionally use them for personal matters, most have never been dirtied. In another month, it will be time to issue rubber boots again. If this continues, in a few years, we will become hoarders of rubber boots. However, the raincoats and rubber boots of those exploration workers working in areas with constant rain and year-round standing water often become worn out before the prescribed service life. In such cases, what should be done?
    It is impractical to prescribe the service life of raincoats and rubber boots in general terms based only on the type of work and not on specific working conditions. Although the notice emphasizes strict prevention of egalitarian tendencies, the notice itself has the shortcomings of egalitarianism.
    It is hoped that higher authorities will not make decisions subjectively when issuing any regulations. If it is impossible to take everything into account, it is better to give only some general guidelines and allow those below some flexibility to adapt to local conditions and specific circumstances.

### 实际上还是平均主义

    实际上还是平均主义
    去年9月间，地质部中南地质局曾颁发了一个关于“野外装备实施细则”的通知。通知中规定，有的野外地质勘探人员每人每年发给雨衣雨裤各一件；有的人每两年或三年发给一套。水靴同雨衣一样，也是根据不同工种规定不同使用年限。通知中还强调了必须严格地执行这个规定，防止平均主义的偏向。
    这种根据不同工种划分使用年限的雨衣、水靴发给办法，看起来似乎很合理。其实不然。因为地质勘探队分布在各地，各地的气候和地质条件都不相同，有的地方多雨，有的地方少雨；有的工程可以风雨无阻地进行，有的工程赶上雨天，即使穿上雨衣和水靴也不能施工。如我们四一九队，主要勘探方法是槽探和井探。我们工作地点的槽、井内无积水，土质也干燥，晴天根本不需要水靴；而到了雨天，由于是露天作业，又无法施工。因此，这里的井探工人所发的水靴，除少数人因私事偶尔用两次外，多数人的水靴还从来没有沾过泥。再过一个月，又到发水靴的时候了，长此下去，几年以后，我们就会变成水靴的囤积户了。可是，那些在常年多雨和经年积水地区工作的勘探工作人员们，他们的雨衣和水靴又常常没有到规定的使用年限就破烂了。在这样的情况下，应该怎么办呢？
    只根据工种，不根据具体劳动条件，笼统地规定雨衣、水靴的使用年限，是不切合实际的。通知中虽然强调要严防平均主义偏向，但这个通知本身就有平均主义的缺点。
    希望上级颁发任何规定时，不要主观主义地决定问题，如果不可能照顾得全面，就只作一些原则指示，给下边一些能够因地制宜、因事制宜的机动余地也好。
