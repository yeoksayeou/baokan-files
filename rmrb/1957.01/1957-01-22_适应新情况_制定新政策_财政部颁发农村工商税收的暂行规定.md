Xinhua News Agency, January 19th: The Ministry of Finance recently promulgated the "Provisional Regulations on Rural Industrial and Commercial Taxation." These provisional regulations were formulated to adapt the tax system to the new situation of rural economic development and changes after the high tide of agricultural cooperativization. The purpose is to enable the rural tax system to play a role in both encouraging the development of diverse agricultural economies and protecting the production and operation of specialized handicrafts; and in both taking care of farmers' increased income and appropriately ensuring state revenue.

The provisional regulations stipulate that agricultural, forestry, fishing, and animal husbandry products that are used for public purposes within an agricultural production cooperative, or distributed by the agricultural cooperative for use by its members, are mutually adjusted among cooperative members, and are self-produced and self-used by individual farmers, are all exempt from taxation. For the portion sold externally, only products that fall within the scope of commodities subject to commodity circulation tax or goods tax are subject to commodity circulation tax or goods tax. Other products sold externally are exempt from taxation if they hold a certificate issued by the township people's committee or agricultural cooperative proving that they are self-produced.

The taxation of products manufactured or processed by handicraft workshops and other units attached to agricultural cooperatives is handled in accordance with the principle of taking care of sideline occupations without affecting specialized occupations. In terms of commodity circulation tax and goods tax, it is stipulated that, in addition to providing flour to cooperative members that is given preferential treatment and is not taxed, other products that should pay commodity circulation tax and goods tax must be taxed. In terms of business tax, it is stipulated that, in addition to the portion used for public purposes within the cooperative being tax-exempt, other business income or processing income must be taxed.

For service units attached to agricultural cooperatives, such as restaurants, barbershops, hotels, sewing, transportation, and other organizations, their business income and profits are required to pay business tax. However, income from temporary production labor services organized by agricultural cooperatives for members and individual farmers, such as crushing stones and digging earth, may be exempt from tax.

In order to restrict agricultural cooperatives from engaging in purely commercial activities through taxation, to prevent farmers from engaging in commerce and neglecting agriculture, and affecting the development of agriculture and agricultural and sideline products, the provisional regulations stipulate that agricultural cooperatives that have shops in cities or market towns, regardless of whether the shops sell self-produced products or non-self-produced products, must pay business tax. If they engage in commodity selling activities without setting up shops, they must pay a 5% temporary commercial tax. However, the temporary commercial tax payable by agricultural cooperatives can be paid back within the cooperative; members and individual farmers must still pay in the place of sale.

At the same time, in order to increase farmers' income and simplify tax payment procedures, it is also stipulated that agricultural cooperatives and their affiliated handicraft or service units are all exempt from income tax; all vouchers, account books, and contracts written are exempt from stamp tax. The business tax rate, regardless of industry or the amount of income or profit, is uniformly calculated and paid at 3%. Products that have already paid goods tax are no longer subject to business tax upon sale. The business tax and temporary commercial tax payable by agricultural cooperatives and their affiliated units are uniformly summarized and paid monthly.

In addition, these regulations also take into account the uneven development of rural cash crops and sideline production in various regions, and stipulate that under unified principles, the people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government should formulate specific implementation measures based on local conditions and implement them after promulgation.

    适应新情况　制定新政策
    财政部颁发农村工商税收的暂行规定
    新华社19日讯　财政部最近颁发了“关于农村工商税收的暂行规定”。这个暂行规定是为了在税收上适应农业合作化高潮以后农村经济发展变化的新情况而制定的。目的是使农村税收制度发挥既能鼓励农业多种经济的发展，又能保护专业手工业的生产经营；既能照顾农民增加收入，又能适当保证国家收入的作用。
    这个暂行规定中规定：凡是农业生产合作社社内公用，或者由农业社分配给本社社员使用，社内社员间相互进行调剂，以及个体农民自产自用的农、林、渔、牧产品，都不纳税；对外出售部分，只就属于应该征收商品流通税、货物税范围的产品，征收商品流通税或货物税；其余产品对外出售，凡是持有乡人民委员会或农业社开给的证明，证明为自产品的，都不纳税。
    对农业社附设的手工业工场、作坊等单位制造或者加工的产品的税收，本着照顾副业而不影响专业的原则处理。在商品流通税、货物税方面规定，除了供应社内社员的麦粉，给予照顾不纳税以外，其他应该交纳商品流通税、货物税的产品都要纳税。在营业税方面规定，除了社内公用部分不纳税以外，其他营业收入或加工收益都要纳税。
    对农业社附设的服务性单位，如饭馆、理发铺、旅店、缝纫、运输等组织的营业收入和收益，规定要交纳营业税；但是农业社组织社员和个体农民从事劳务性临时生产所得的收益，如砸石子、挖土方等，可以免税。
    为了在税收上限制农业社经营纯商业，以防止农民经商误农，影响农业和农副业的发展，暂行规定中规定：凡是农业社在城市、集镇设有店铺的，不论这个店铺经营的是自产品或非自产的产品，都要交纳营业税，如不设店铺而从事贩卖商品活动的，则要交纳5％的临时商业税。但农业社应交的临时商业税，可以回到社内交纳；社员及个体农民则一律仍在销地交纳。
    同时为了增加农民收入、简化纳税手续，还规定：农业社及附设的手工业或服务性单位一律免纳所得税；所书立的各种凭证、账册、合同一律免纳印花税。营业税的税率，不分行业，不分收入额或收益额，一律按3％计算交纳。销售已纳货物税的产品，不再交纳营业税。农业社及附设单位应该交纳的营业税和临时商业税，一律按月汇总交纳。
    此外，这个规定还照顾到各个地区农村经济作物和副业生产发展的不平衡情况，规定在统一原则下，由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会因地制宜，机动掌握，制定具体的执行办法公布执行。
