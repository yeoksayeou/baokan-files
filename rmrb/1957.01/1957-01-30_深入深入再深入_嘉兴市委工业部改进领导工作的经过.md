Deeper, Deeper, and Still Deeper
The Jiaxing Municipal Party Committee Industry Department's Improvement of Leadership Work
Chen Xinhai, Shi Zai

The Jiaxing Municipal Party Committee Industry Department, once called "meter readers" by factories and enterprises, has transformed its generalized leadership style in the increase production and practice economy movement, going deep down to help grassroots units improve production, which has been welcomed by grassroots units.

A new atmosphere has emerged on the Jiaxing industrial production front. Thirteen factories in the city have completed their 1956 profit plans ahead of schedule. The Jiaxing Paper Muscle Factory and Huachang Electric Welding Factory, which were originally expected to fail to complete their full-year profit plans for 1956, have also completed them ahead of schedule. The increase production and practice economy movement in various factories is developing in depth.

	Going Down is Not Equal to Going Deep

After August last year, the number of times that cadres of the Jiaxing Municipal Party Committee Industry Department went to factories increased significantly compared to before. As soon as it was time for work, they would rush out of the office and head to the factories. However, in early October, many factories still said that the cadres of the Industry Department were not going deep enough. They said they went down to "ask for materials" and "ask for numbers." At this time, the cadres of the Industry Department were indeed frustrated: We are running around below every day, how can you still say we are not going deep enough? What exactly is the problem? They laid out the situation: Some time ago, although the number of times they went to the factory was high, they were just running around everywhere. In this way, although some noteworthy and needed problems to be solved were understood in a factory, because they did not understand the factory's past situation and even the overall situation, even if they wanted to help research and solve it, there was no way to start. At the same time, some people's purpose for going to the factory was not clear. After going down to understand some situations, they would report back and think that they had "completed the task." "It is up to the factory leaders to solve what problems." In fact, the so-called "going to the factory" in the past cannot be regarded as going deep, it was just walking from the office to the factory.

		Dividing into Areas and Fixing Points

After studying this situation, the comrades of the Industry Department decided to divide the city's affiliated factories into five areas according to region, select a key point for each area, and have one person contact and grasp it. It was required that the personnel going to the factories must truly grasp the situation and specifically help solve key problems in production in order to be considered going deep into reality and providing specific leadership.

After dividing into "areas" and fixing "points," the shortcomings of "running around everywhere," "failing to grasp the situation," and "having no clue about work" began to be overcome. For example: The comrade who went to the Xin Jia Iron Factory found that the factory's waste of raw materials was very serious. Many iron filings that could be used by the pot factory were discarded as garbage. According to preliminary calculations, the iron filings wasted from January to October 1956 were worth a total of 8,000 yuan. After the workers of the workshop discussed and researched, they believed that this phenomenon was related to the complacency of the factory leaders, so everyone presented these facts and educated the leaders to overcome their complacency. Now, the increase production and practice economy movement in this factory has been carried out smoothly.

	Staying at a "Point" Requires Leading the "Surface"

After dividing into areas, some comrades stayed at a "point" and lost the "surface," and did not pay attention to the work of general factories for a long time. As a result of doing this, although the work of several key factories was helped, some practical problems that had existed for a long time in general factories could not be solved. After studying this situation, the Industry Department realized that only by summarizing experience from the "point" to drive the "surface" can the shortcomings of staying at a "point" and losing the "surface" be avoided. Since then, they have paid attention to introducing a series of work experiences of the "point" to drive the "surface," which has played a role of "combining the point and the surface."

Of course, determining the key point does not mean sticking to one point forever. If advanced work experience is discovered in a general factory, it is necessary to temporarily shift the focus to help summarize the advanced experience of these factories to promote the overall situation.

	Must Prescribe the Right Medicine

Since the Industry Department attached importance to the work of driving the "surface" with the "point," it has successively introduced the work experience of some key factories to the cadres of factories and enterprises. However, in addition to the experience of the Jiaxing Iron Factory in mobilizing the masses to expose waste, some people reported that the experience of other factories was not prescribing the right medicine and did not have much effect. This situation aroused the attention of the cadres of the Industry Department, making them realize that: When transmitting experience to other factories, it must be timely (according to the development of the movement) and to the taste (according to the needs). To achieve this, it is necessary to go deep down to understand what they need. Some small factory leaders said: "Our factory has a poor foundation and the organization is not sound, so the experience of large factories cannot be used." Therefore, they focused on the characteristics and needs of small factories and introduced the experience of the Paper Muscle Factory to small factories on how to mobilize the masses to carry out the increase production and practice economy movement. Many small factories thought that this factory's experience introduction was worth listening to and useful.

When organizing experience exchanges, the Industry Department also learned from the practice of the Putuo District Committee of Shanghai: launching discussions and appraising experience. Learning from the good, supplementing the deficiencies, and discarding the backward parts to make the experience more complete. For example, after the Paper Muscle Factory introduced the experience of mobilizing the masses, the heads of various small factories affirmed in the discussion that: It is particularly good to give play to the backbone role of the group leaders, which is worth learning. However, it was also pointed out that: The organizational role of the trade union and the Youth League has not been fully exerted; the ideological mobilization of temporary workers has not been paid attention to, and the practice of sending permanent workers to supervise temporary workers is wrong. In this way, both the factory introducing the experience and the factory listening to the experience gained experience and lessons.

	One Link After Another

The Jiaxing Municipal Party Committee Industry Department also paid attention to timely understanding the current situation of various factories in leading industrial production, grasping the key problems of universality in solving production, and helping factories develop forward link by link. Initially, the thought of "no production to increase, no way to save" existing in the factories was solved through typical introductions, and then the factories were guided to fully mobilize the masses, find tricks to increase production, plug loopholes in waste, and formulate increase production and practice economy indicators. However, after the increase production and practice economy indicators were set, the factories had no idea what to do next and did not know how to achieve the indicators. After learning about this situation, the Industry Department proposed that: Guiding the factories to achieve the increase production and practice economy indicators is the most important issue at present. At that time, the cadres of the Jiaxing Distillery and the Jiaxing Oil Pressing Factory found that the key to these two factories' ability to break production records one after another, which had not improved in the past, was to continue to carry out the advanced producer movement. Therefore, it was determined that: Continuing to deepen the advanced producer movement should be the main link to achieve the increase production and practice economy indicators, and the increase production and practice economy movement should be combined with the advanced producer movement.

    深入深入再深入
    嘉兴市委工业部改进领导工作的经过
    陈心海　石在
    曾经被工厂企业称为“查火表的”中共嘉兴市委工业部，在增产节约运动中转变了一般化的领导作风，深入下去，帮助基层搞好生产，受到基层单位的欢迎。
    嘉兴市工业生产战线上出现了一片新气象。全市有十三个工厂提前完成1956年利润计划。原来预计完不成1956年全年利润计划的嘉兴纸筋厂、华昌电焊厂也提前完成了。各工厂的增产节约运动正在深入展开。
        下去不等于深入
    去年8月以后，嘉兴市委工业部的干部到工厂去的次数比以前显著增加了。一到上班时间，他们就匆忙地离开办公室往工厂跑。谁知，在10月初许多工厂仍然说工业部的干部不深入。说他们下去是“要材料的”，“要数字的”。这时候，工业部干部的确苦闷了：我们天天在下面跑，怎么还说不深入呢？问题究竟在哪里呢？他们把情况摆了开来：前些时候，下厂的次数虽然多，只是到处跑，满天飞。这样，在一个工厂虽然了解到一些值得注意的和需要解决的问题，由于不了解这个工厂的过去情况以至全面情况，即使想帮助研究解决，也无法下手。同时，有的人对下厂的目的性也不明确，下去了解一些情况，回来一汇报，就以为“完成任务”了。“要解决什么问题是工厂领导的事”。实际上过去所谓“下厂”不能算做深入，只不过是从办公室走到工厂去罢了。
            分片定点
    工业部的同志研究了这个情况，决定把全市所属工厂按地区分成五个片，每片选定一个重点，由一个人去联系、掌握。要求下到工厂的人员一定要真正掌握情况，具体帮助解决生产上的关键问题，才能算是深入实际，具体领导。
    分“片”定“点”以后，“到处跑、满天飞”、“抓不起情况，工作没有头绪”等缺点开始克服了。例如：下到新嘉铁工厂的同志，发现厂里浪费原材料的现象十分严重。许多可供锅厂用的铁屑当作垃圾抛掉，据初步计算，从1956年1月至10月浪费的铁屑共值八千元。经过工场的工人讨论研究，认为这种现象和工厂领导人员的自满思想有关，于是大家摆出这些事实，教育了领导人员克服自满情绪。现在，这个工厂的增产节约运动顺利开展起来了。
    蹲了“点”要带起“面”
    分片下去以后，有些同志蹲了“点”丢了“面”，长期不过问一般厂的工作。这样做的结果，虽然对几个重点厂的工作有帮助，而对于一般厂中长期存在的一些实际问题却得不到解决。工业部研究这个情况，认识到只有从“点”总结出经验来带动“面”，才能避免蹲“点”丢“面”的缺点。从此，他们就注意到介绍了“点”的一系列的工作经验来带动“面”，起到了“点面结合”的作用。
    当然，确定了重点并不等于永远固守在一点里。如果在一般厂里，发现了先进工作经验，就需要临时转移重点，去帮助总结这些厂的先进经验来推动全面。
          要对症下药
    工业部自从重视了以“点”带动“面”的工作以后，陆续向工厂企业干部介绍了一些重点厂的工作经验。但是，除了嘉兴铁工厂的发动群众揭发浪费等经验以外，有人反映其他厂的经验没有对症下药，作用不大。这个情况引起了工业部干部的重视，使他们认识到：向别的厂输送经验，必须是适时的（根据运动的发展）合口味的（根据需要）。要做到这一点，就必须深入下去了解他们需要什么。有的小型厂负责人说：“我们厂基础差，组织不健全，大厂经验用不上”，于是他们就针对小型厂的特点和需要，由纸筋厂向小型厂介绍如何发动群众开展增产节约运动的经验。许多小厂听了这个厂的经验介绍，认为听得下去，有用处。
    工业部在组织经验交流的时候，还学习了上海市普陀区委的做法：展开讨论，鉴定经验。学习好的，补充不足的，扔掉落后的部分，使经验更加完整。例如，在纸筋厂介绍发动群众的经验后，各小型厂负责人在讨论中就肯定：发挥小组长的骨干作用特别好，值得学习。但是又指出：还没有充分发挥工会和青年团的组织作用；对临时工的思想发动工作没有引起重视，而用派长工去监督临时工的做法，是不对的。这样，介绍经验的厂和听取经验的厂都取得了经验教训。
        一环扣一环
    嘉兴市委工业部在领导工业生产中还注意到及时了解各厂当前情况，抓住解决生产中普遍性的关键问题，帮助工厂一环扣一环地向前发展。起初，通过典型介绍解决了工厂中存在的“无产可增，无法节约”的思想，随后指导各厂充分发动群众，找增产窍门，堵塞浪费漏洞，制定了增产节约指标。但是各厂在增产节约指标订出后，对于下一步的工作心中无数，不知道究竟如何来实现指标。工业部了解这一情况以后就提出：指导各厂去实现增产节约指标，是眼前最重要的问题。当时，在嘉兴酒厂和嘉兴榨油厂的干部，发现这两个过去工作没有起色的厂能够接连突破生产纪录的关键在于继续地展开了先进生产者运动。因此就确定：以继续深入开展先进生产者运动作为实现增产节约指标的主要环节，把增产节约运动和先进生产者运动结合起来。
