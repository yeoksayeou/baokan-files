    Manager Zhou Goes Home
    Liubing
    It was the weekend again. Manager Zhou of a certain construction engineering company in Xi'an, who was studying in an advanced cadre theory self-study class, was, as usual, going back to his wife and children. A small jeep from the company was waiting for him in front of the door. He closed his book, put on his coat, glanced briefly at his desk and room, and hurried out the door.
    Manager Zhou frowned when he saw the jeep and turned to look at the driver with surprise, asking, "Is this the car?"
    "Yes," the driver replied worriedly.
    "Why did you bring this car again? Didn't I say long ago to use the yellow sedan?" Manager Zhou questioned, somewhat annoyed.
    "The yellow sedan was taken by the deputy manager for some business and hasn't returned yet; I was afraid of being late, so I drove this car," the driver explained gently, fearing to offend Manager Zhou, who was in a bad mood.
    Manager Zhou was finally indignant. He frowned and thought to himself: What important matter? If there's something important, why not go in the jeep, but insist on taking that yellow sedan? Isn't this deliberately going against me in the name of work needs? He concluded that this was a sign of disrespect for the leader. So he said decisively to the driver, "I'm not riding in this jeep. Go! Call and have that car brought here."
    The driver went to make the call. Manager Zhou paced beside the jeep with his hands behind his back. Seeing the thick dust on the nylon glass of the car door, he frowned even more in annoyance. On one hand, he was dissatisfied with his subordinates, and on the other hand, he complained about his superiors: Now some people who are not as good as me are also riding in cars, but my application to buy a car has not been approved yet; today, even that yellow sedan-style station wagon wasn't sent, but I, the manager in charge of more than 20,000 workers, have to ride home in such a substandard car. If the comrades studying with me see this, it will be a joke. Besides, they don't think of others at all. Riding home in this car, my newly made woolen suit will surely be covered in dust, and my eyebrows and face will turn into a mud person—like a dirt donkey, that would be even more laughable, wouldn't it? Thinking this, his heart was filled with a mix of bitterness and resentment.
    The driver returned and hesitantly reported, "That sedan won't be back for a while. The company said, please take this car this time, and next time they will definitely use that car to pick you up." Upon hearing this, Manager Zhou's anger towards those who "don't think of others at all" finally erupted into a rage. His face turned livid, and he thought indignantly: I'm not so easy to brush off! If they have the ability to send that car out, they must have the ability to bring it back. So he shouted to the driver, "I'm not riding in this car," and in front of the astonished driver, he turned his face, stamped his foot, and went to make a phone call himself in a fit of anger.
    After a round of reprimands on the phone, Manager Zhou was victorious. The company promised to find a small car from another agency. When Manager Zhou, with a triumphant look, stood proudly in front of the door with radiant eyes, breathing heavily through his nostrils, the sound of a car horn came from afar, and two faint yellow lights were seen through the dust-filled wilderness. In an instant, a brand-new small car lay in front of the manager.
    Manager Zhou stepped into the car. The car door slammed shut. With a "beep," the small car sped away, with the jeep, empty except for the driver, closely following behind, as if acting as a special guard for Manager Zhou's exclusive car.
    The car honked its horn, demanding that transport vehicles and porters on the ring road give way. Through the lights, Manager Zhou saw that the pedestrians, vehicles, and horses on the road were all evenly covered in a layer of dust. Manager Zhou let out a long sigh. Although he still felt a little melancholy about not being able to get a car as he wished, he had dispelled the anger that had recently accumulated in his chest. He thought, it's thanks to my insistence on getting another car that I avoided this dust disaster; however, I still need to take the opportunity to educate some people about respecting and caring for their leaders. Thinking this, a ripple of a smile spread from the corners of his eyes and mouth, slowly spreading behind his ears. The driver of the jeep following closely behind also let out a long sigh at this moment, venting his dissatisfaction with the manager's extravagance, and thinking indignantly: This is truly what people often say, "Only read the words of the sages, but do not act like a sage." May I ask, how is this idea of showing off and indulging in pleasure related to the Marxist-Leninist theories you have learned?

    周经理回家
    流冰
    又是周末。在高级干部理论自修班学习的西安某建筑工程公司周经理照例要回到爱人和孩子身边去。从公司所在地开来的一辆小吉普，正在门前等候着他。他掩起书本，披上大衣，稍微环顾一下书桌和房间，便匆匆地跨出门来。
    周经理望了一下吉普车就皱起了眉头，转过脸来用惊异的眼光看着司机问道：“是这辆车么？”
    “是的，”司机耽心地回答。
    “为什么又开这辆车来，我不是早就说过，要用那辆黄色的轿车吗？”周经理有些气恼地质问。
    “那辆黄轿车副经理有事用去了，还没有回来；怕误了时间，就开这辆车来了。”司机生怕触恼了正在火气头上的周经理，温顺地解释着。
    周经理终于忿忿然了。沉着脸暗自想：有什么大事？有事为什么不乘吉普车去，而偏偏要乘那辆黄轿车呢？这不是故意借着工作需要的名义同我过不去吗？他断定这是一种不尊重首长的行为。于是便斩钢截铁地对司机说：“我不乘这吉普车。去！打电话把那辆车找来。”
    司机打电话去了。周经理倒背着手，在吉普车旁徘徊。看到蒙在车门尼龙玻璃上的厚厚的尘土，便烦乱得更加皱紧了眉头。一方面是对下级的不满，一方面是对上级的埋怨：现在有些不如我的人，也坐上卧车了，而我申请买一辆卧车，至今还没有批下来；今天索兴连那辆黄色轿式的小旅行车也不送来了，却让我这掌管两万多名工人的经理，乘这样别脚的车子回家，这让一起学习的同志们看见，真是笑话。再说，他们也全不替别人想想，乘这种车回家，一路上准得把我这身新作的毛料衣服全扑上土的，连眉带脸我就成了一个土人了——像只土驴一样，那才更好笑呢？想着，心里便充满了又酸又辣的滋味。
    司机回来了，迟疑地报告：“那辆轿车一时还回不来，公司里说，请经理这次就乘这辆车，下次一定用那辆车来接”。听到这话以后，周经理对于那些“全不替别人想想”的人的忿气终于爆发成了盛怒。他面色铁青，愤愤地想：我才不是那样好打发的呢！他们有本事把那辆车打发出去，就得有本事把它找回来。于是，他向司机高叫了一声“我不乘这辆车”，便在愕然失措的司机面前，扭转脸，顿顿脚，气抖抖地自己去打电话了。
    经过在电话里的一番训饬以后，周经理胜利了。公司里答应设法另从别的机关借一辆小卧车来。当周经理带着得胜的神色，目光四射，傲然屹立门前，鼻孔里粗粗的出着大气的时候，远处传来了小汽车的喇叭声，透过尘土迷漫的荒野，看到了两缕暗黄色的灯光。刹那间，一辆崭新的小卧车便横卧在经理面前。
    周经理跨进车去。车门砰然的关闭。嘟的一声，小卧车便疾然驶去，除了司机就空无一人的吉普车紧紧地跟在它后面追踪着，好像在充当周经理专用车的特别护卫。
    汽车鸣着喇叭，要求行走在环城马路上的运输车辆、搬运夫们让路。透过灯光，周经理看到路上的行人、车辆、马匹……全都匀匀地披上了一层尘土。周经理长长的出了一口气，虽然他对不能如愿以偿地得到小卧车还感到一点惆怅，但已消释了胸中新积起来的忿气。他想，多亏了我坚持着另要一辆车来，才免去这尘土的灾难；然而，回去还是要抽机会对一些人进行些尊重和爱护首长的教育。想着，一丝笑的涟漪，从眼角和嘴角边，同时展开，缓缓地散向耳后去了。紧跟在后面的驾驶着吉普车的司机，这时，也长长的吁出一口气，泄出了对经理这骄奢的不满，忿忿地思索着：这真是人们常说的“只读圣贤书，不行圣贤事”，请问你这种耍排场，贪享受的思想，和你学的马克思列宁主义的理论，又怎样联系起来呢？
