Every Cow Gives Birth to a Calf, Filling the Mountains in Three Years

The Chengdong Agricultural Cooperative in Dongliu County, Anhui Province, currently has 141 member households. Before the establishment of the cooperative, there were only 81 head of cattle, averaging less than one head per household. After the cooperative was established in 1955, the number of cattle in the cooperative increased to 191. In 1956 alone, 50 calves were born. Now, the cooperative not only has enough cattle for its own use, but also has a surplus to sell. In 1956, 44 head of cattle were sold, increasing income by 4,000 yuan. The members generally reflected: "The establishment of the advanced cooperative is really good, truly with granaries full of grain and cattle filling the mountains."

    Bottom Left: After a cow gives birth to a calf, the cooperative always feeds it four to six eggs to replenish the cow's body.
    Bottom: The cooperative has prepared winter feed for each head of cattle, with an average of 4,000 catties of rice straw per head, enough for them to eat during the winter.

    条条母牛生小牛，三年满山头
    安徽东流县城东农业社，现有一百四十一户社员。在办社以前，只有八十一头牛，每户还平均不到一头。1955年办社以后，全社耕牛已增加到一百九十一头。1956年一年，又繁殖了五十头。现在，社里的耕牛不仅够用，而且还有多余的可出卖。在1956年，就卖出耕牛四十四头，增加了四千元的收入。社员们普遍反映：“成立高级社就是好，真是粮食满囤，耕牛满山头”。

    左下　母牛生下小牛后，社里总是喂它四到六个鸡蛋，来补养母牛身体。
    下　社里已给每头耕牛准备好的过冬饲料平均每头牛有四千斤稻草，足够它们过冬食用。
