Procurement Personnel, You've Worked Hard!

    To supply the meat needs of the people of Beijing during the Spring Festival, the Beijing Food Company organized more than 100 procurement personnel around New Year's Day 1957 to purchase pigs, sheep, cattle, chickens… from Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, and the Northwest provinces.

    Ma Longshu, deputy section chief of the Second Business Section of the Beijing Food Company, who recently returned to Beijing from Xilin Gol League in Inner Mongolia, told reporters that Inner Mongolia is currently experiencing heavy snow and blocked roads, with temperatures dropping to below minus 30 degrees Celsius. Transporting thousands of cattle and sheep is an extremely arduous task. From Xilin Gol League to Saihantala Station on the Jier Railway is about 800 li (approximately 400 kilometers), and the only means of transportation is large trucks, which take four days for a round trip, with only one place to stop and eat along the way. The deep snow and slippery roads keep people constantly on edge.

    These places also have difficulty accessing water, and often lack green vegetables and grain (herdsmen mainly eat meat), so living conditions are indeed somewhat difficult. However, no one is complaining about this. Whether at the railway station or the bus station, procurement personnel can be seen helping to load and unload cattle and sheep day and night. The Spring Festival is approaching, but some procurement staff are voluntarily staying in the Inner Mongolia region. Comrades like Jin Guangjun and Sha Haiquan are already in their fifties, and they are vying to let the young people go home for the festival. To reassure the young people and let them return home with peace of mind, they deliberately said, "We've experienced dozens of Spring Festivals, it's nothing new!"

    Some procurement personnel also went deep into Sunite Left Banner, Pingdiquan, and other places to purchase large quantities of chickens, eggs, and camels. These places are sparsely populated and have inconvenient transportation, so they had to camp on the snow, carrying grain, charcoal, and tents. Generally, they could only purchase one or two hundred chickens and some eggs a day, and then use ox carts to haul them to the railway line. The comrades who purchased camels had an even harder time; they needed to drive the camels back on foot (only about 30 li, or 15 kilometers, a day), so a round trip took more than two months.

    Hardworking procurement personnel, those who eat the things you have procured, how can they not thank you! (Ye)

Tense Labor in the Slaughterhouse

    I visited the Beijing Slaughterhouse on the eve of the Spring Festival. I witnessed the soaring enthusiasm of the slaughterhouse workers. Here, thousands of pigs are slaughtered every day, but one cannot hear a single pig squeal. Workers at the electrical stunning station use electrical stunners on the pigs' heads, and the lively, jumping pigs immediately fall down, silently sliding along the chute to the slaughter trough to await slaughter. Workers at the electrical stunning station once stunned 720 pigs in one hour and ten minutes. Such high work efficiency of the electrical stunning workers keeps the knife-wielding slaughter workers very busy. Because if electrically stunned pigs are not slaughtered in time, they will recover within a few seconds. A knife worker standing at the slaughter trough slaughters as many as come. Advanced producer Wang Binghua once set a record of slaughtering 4,500 pigs a day by himself.

    In the dehairing section, steam is everywhere, and people's faces are barely visible. When the slaughter task increases before each festival, they dehair an average of more than 80 pigs per person per hour. One worker told me that during this time, they have to get up and move around several times at night because their arms ache and they can't sleep. They deal with 60-65 degree Celsius hot water all day long, so most of the workers' hands are swollen, and they cannot clench their ten fingers.

    Although the temperature in the section for opening the pigs' stomachs is not as high as in the dehairing section, the workers cannot wear cotton-padded clothes to work even in the cold winter. If the time from slaughter to opening the stomach exceeds half an hour, the pork may spoil; therefore, the workers here cannot rest for even a minute. The pigs, already dehaired, hang high on the chute, and one worker has to open 500 pigs per hour. The workers constantly stand up and squat down, not even having time to straighten their backs and catch their breath.

    In the oil-removing section, there are careful workers. Their task is to clean the dirtiest parts of the pig's body—the internal organs—into food that everyone loves to eat. They wear tall rubber boots and stand in pig manure, concentrating on their work, not letting the pig intestines have even the slightest flaw.

    In several sections, I saw several medical personnel examining for animal diseases. To safeguard the health of millions of citizens, some are checking the pig's lymph nodes to see if there is a terrible anthrax infection; some are checking the pig's internal organs to see if there are parasites; and some are checking for other diseases.

    When I said goodbye to the slaughterhouse workers, I asked them if they had anything they wanted to convey to the citizens of Beijing through the newspaper. Later, one comrade humbly said on behalf of the workers: "Beijing only has this slaughterhouse, and our task is very heavy. Although we have completed every slaughter task assigned by the commercial departments for each festival, our work inevitably has shortcomings, and we hope that the people of the capital will offer more criticism and guidance." (Huang Zhi)

For the Convenience of People Buying "New Year's Goods"

    On January 27th, the Wangfujing Department Store in Beijing was crowded with people purchasing New Year's goods. On this day, the total sales volume increased by 40% compared to weekdays; especially for canned meat, sweets, and pastries, the sales volume more than doubled.

    Among the most popular local products were Hangzhou's Torreya nuts, Beijing's candied fruits, Haikou's hard and soft coconut candies, and Shanghai's various flavored preserved plums. According to the sales staff, in general, northerners buy more food transported from the south, while southerners buy more local products from the north.

    To avoid crowding, the department store specially set up six temporary stalls and mobilized more than 100 people from various sections, offices, and other business counters to help with the sales at the stalls. Manager Su, who is currently studying at the Commercial Cadre School, also came back to help. The most frequently purchased items, such as fruit candies and Longkou vermicelli, were pre-packaged to save time, which made everyone feel satisfied. (Bei)

Let More People Take Baths and Get Haircuts

    All employees of the barbering and bathhouse industries under the Beijing Second Welfare Company have completely stopped rotating shifts since January 24th to meet the needs of the people of the capital as much as possible during the Spring Festival; they have extended their business hours by two or three hours from the 28th to the 30th. Several bathhouses have added seats.

    The Tsinghua Yuan Bathhouse originally had about 1,100 to 1,200 customers a day, but in the few days before the Spring Festival, the number suddenly increased to about 1,600. In order to allow more customers to take a pleasant bath and celebrate the Spring Festival cleanly, they washed the old rattan chairs and added forty seats from the 25th, and bought dozens of new bamboo baskets for customers to put their clothes in. It was also decided to extend business hours by two hours for the three days before the Spring Festival. With so many customers, the service staff are often overwhelmed. So, boiler room workers, chiropodists, and carpenters all voluntarily came to help, and even the manager and accountant often took time to greet customers.

    A few days ago, all the employees of the Shidai Barber Shop held a meeting to discuss how to do a good job in serving customers during the Spring Festival. At the meeting, everyone unanimously agreed to give up the three-hour rotation; to minimize the time for haircuts and perms while ensuring quality. In the past few days, many employees have been arriving at work early and leaving late to ensure they can start working as soon as the doors open. (Shao Likun)

### 在春节之前

    在春节之前
    采购人员，你们辛苦了
    为了供应首都人民在春节期间的肉食需要，北京市食品公司在1957年元旦前后，就组织了一百多个采购人员到内蒙古、河北、山西、河南以及西北各省采购猪、羊、牛、鸡……
    最近才从内蒙古的锡林郭勒盟回到北京的北京市食品公司第二业务科副科长马龙书告诉记者，现在的内蒙古正是大雪封路的日子，气温降到零下三十多度，把成千上万只牛羊运出来是一件十分艰苦的事情。从锡林郭勒盟到集二铁路的赛汗塔拉车站大约有八百里路，唯一的交通工具大卡车，来回一趟需要行驶四天，而中途只有一处可以停车和吃饭。雪深路滑，人们随时随地都在提心吊胆。
    这些地方吃水也很困难，经常见不到青菜和粮食（牧民以吃肉为主），生活条件确实艰苦些。但是，没有人为这闹情绪。无论在火车站、汽车站上，都可以看到采购人员不分昼夜地帮助装卸牛、羊。春节就要到了，可是还有些采购员主动地留在内蒙古地区。像金光俊、沙海泉等同志，都是五十多岁的人了，他们争着让青年人回家过节。为了想使年轻人安心回来，他们故意说：“我们过了几十个春节，不新鲜了！”
    一部分采购员还深入苏尼特左旗、平地泉等地收购了大批鸡、鸡蛋和骆驼。这些地方人烟稀少，交通不便，他们只得带着粮食、木炭和帐篷在雪地上宿营。一般一天只能收购一两百只鸡和一些鸡蛋，然后用牛车拉到铁路线上来。收购骆驼的同志更辛苦，他们需要赶着骆驼走回来（一天只可以走三十里），这样来回一趟需要两个多月的时间。
    辛勤的采购人员们，吃到你们采购来的东西的人，哪能不感谢你们呢！    　　　（叶）
    屠宰场里的紧张劳动
    春节前夕，我访问了北京市屠宰场。我看到了屠宰工人们高涨的劳动积极性。这里，整天屠宰着数以千计的生猪，但是人们却听不见一声猪的嚎叫。麻电台的工人用麻电器往生猪头上一触，跳跳蹦蹦的生猪立刻跌倒，一声不响随着滑道滑到宰槽候宰。麻电台的工人曾经在一小时又十分钟的时间内麻倒过七百二十条生猪。麻电工人这样高的劳动效率使得下一工序的刺刀工人大忙起来。因为经过电麻的生猪要不及时宰杀，在几秒钟之内就会复苏。站在宰槽上的一个刺刀工人是来多少宰多少。先进生产者王炳华曾经创造一天一人宰杀四千五百条猪的纪录。
    在脱毛工段里，到处蒸汽腾腾，简直看不清人们的面目。在每个节日前夕屠杀任务加大的时候，他们每人每小时平均要去八十多口猪的毛。一个工人告诉我，在这种时候，他们晚上要起床活动好几次，因为胳膊疼痛，睡不着觉。他们整天同六十——六十五度的热水打交道，因此，大多数工人的手都是浮肿的，十个手指握不起来。
    开剖猪肚子的工段里的温度虽然没有去毛工段的高，但是工人在严冬也无法穿上棉衣干活。生猪从宰杀到剖肚子的时间超过了半小时，猪肉就可能变质；因此，这里的工人们一分钟也闲不了。已经去过毛的猪高吊在滑道上，一个工人每小时要剖五百口猪。工人不断立起、蹲下，真是连直直腰喘口气的工夫都没有。
    在摘油工段里都是些细心的工人。他们的任务就是把猪身上最肮脏的部分——猪内脏清洗成人人爱吃的食品。他们穿着长统胶靴站在猪粪里聚精会神地工作，不让猪肠出一点破绽。
    在几个工段里，我都看见好几个检验兽疫的医务人员在忙碌着。为了维护几百万市民的健康，他们有的在检查猪的淋巴腺，看是不是有可怕的炭疽传染；有的在检查猪内脏，看是不是有寄生虫；有的在检查其他的病疫。
    我在告别屠宰工人的时候，曾问他们有没有什么话需要通过报纸转告北京市民。后来一个同志代表工人谦逊地说：“北京市只有这个屠宰场，我们的任务很重。每个节日商业部门交下来的屠宰任务我们虽然都完成了，但是，我们的工作难免有缺点，我们希望首都人民多加批评指导。”　　　　　（黄植）
    为了买“年货”的人方便
    1月27日，北京王府井百货大楼挤满了采购年货的人。这一天，营业总额较平日增加了40％；特别是肉食罐头、糖果糕点等商品，营业额增加了一倍以上。
    最受人欢迎的土产中，有杭州的香榧、北京的蜜饯、海口的硬软椰子糖、上海的各味话梅等等。据营业员谈，一般是北方人多买南方运来的食品，而南方人则多买北方的土产。
    为了避免拥挤，百货大楼特别设立了六个临时售货摊，从各科、室和其他的业务柜台动员了一百多人到货摊帮助买货，正在商业干部学校学习的苏经理也回来帮忙了；顾客买得最多的水果糖、龙口粉等商品都事先包捆起来，节省了时间，大家都感到满意。　　　　（蓓）
    让更多的人洗澡理发
    北京市第二福利公司所属的理发、浴池两行业的全体职工，为了在春节期间尽量满足首都人民的需要，自1月24日起已全部停止轮休；在28日至30日延长了营业时间两三小时。好几个澡堂增设了座位。
    清华园浴池原来每天大约只有一千一二百个顾客，春节前几天，突然增加到一千六百人左右。为了让更多顾客能痛痛快快地洗个澡、干干净净地过春节，他们把旧藤椅洗刷干净后，从25日起增设了四十个座位，又买了几十个新箩筐给顾客放衣服。并且决定春节前三天延长两小时的营业时间。顾客一多，服务员常常忙不过来。于是锅炉间工人、修脚工人、木匠都自动来支援，甚至经理，会计也常抽空招待顾客。
    前几天，时代理发馆的全体职工同志开了一个会，研究如何把春节的服务工作做好。会上大家一致同意放弃三小时的轮流；在保证质量的前提下尽量减少理发、烫发的时间。这几天，不少职工同志都提早上班和延迟下班，做到一开门就可以工作。    （邵礼昆）
