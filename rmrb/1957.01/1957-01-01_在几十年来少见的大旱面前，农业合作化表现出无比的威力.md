    In the face of a drought unseen in decades, agricultural collectivization demonstrates unparalleled power

    Opening the "New Hunan Daily" of December 26, 1956, one will find the entire second page filled with shocking material. This page uses a wealth of irrefutable facts to tell readers how the continuous water and drought disasters in the dark decades before liberation brought immense suffering to the people of the whole province; and how, in 1956, a drought unseen in decades was overcome by the heroic people.

    What was the disaster situation in Hunan Province in the decades before liberation? This issue of "New Hunan Daily" reprinted a large number of materials published in old newspapers and periodicals such as "Hunan Dagong Daily", "Xiang Disaster Monthly", and "Hunan Popular Daily" in the past few decades. There are reports specifically introducing the continuous water, drought, and insect disasters, horrific "Pictures of Hunan Famine Victims" and "Brief Table of Famine Victims Starved to Death," and the original text of the "Telegram for Relief" issued by the warlord Wu Peifu to "benevolent gentlemen and compassionate masters at home and abroad." However, in that era of reactionary rule, who could truly help the people effectively fight against disasters? After describing the miserable scene of "corpses of the starved in the fields, and many people fleeing" in the disaster-stricken rural areas, these old-era newspapers could only helplessly issue the mournful sigh, "Alas, our little people, what crime have they committed to suffer this?"

    However, in the era when the people are in charge, especially when thousands of farmers organize agricultural production cooperatives, the people are no longer helpless in the face of natural disasters. Relying on the wise leadership of the Communist Party and the government, and relying on the tremendous power of the collective economy, the broad masses of farmers are fully capable of completely eliminating or greatly reducing serious natural disasters according to their own will. "New Hunan Daily" wrote in a comprehensive report: In 1956, Hunan suffered the worst drought in nearly decades. From June to late December, there was no widespread soaking rain for 170 to 180 consecutive days throughout the province. In many places, ponds and wells dried up, streams and rivers stopped flowing, and even the drinking water for people had to be distributed scoop by scoop by the production team leaders of agricultural cooperatives. However, under such a severe drought threat, the total output of rice in the province still reached about 20 billion catties, only 3 billion catties less than the bumper year of 1955; while the output of cotton, jute, ramie, tea, tea oil, tung oil, citrus, oilseeds, and live pigs all increased compared to 1955. More than 40,000 of the original 90,000 agricultural cooperatives in the province increased production. The total value of agricultural and sideline production in the province reached more than 90% of that in 1955.

    In the spring of 1955, Hunan Province basically achieved elementary agricultural collectivization. Relying on the great power of collectivization, from the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956, the province completed 820,000 water conservancy projects, increasing the irrigated area by more than 1.48 million mu; accumulated more than 8 billion dan of soil fertilizer, more than double the previous year; the double-cropping rice area expanded from more than 5.3 million mu to 12.5 million mu; and promoted many new technologies in agricultural production. In the fight against drought, more than 3 million people were mobilized throughout the province, and 1 million waterwheels were used. In many places, water was drawn up the mountains to irrigate the fields with dozens or even twenty tiers of waterwheels. Now, the profit distribution work of most agricultural cooperatives in the province has basically come to an end. In the cooperatives that increased or maintained production, the vast majority of members have increased their income.

    Let's look at the situation in Yueyang County, one of the severely affected areas. The county experienced a severe drought for nearly 200 days, and 18 of the 45 townships in the county suffered reduced production. However, despite this, the farmers in the county still had enough food for the whole year (excluding miscellaneous grains, the cooperatives with the least food retained still had about 450 catties of grain per person). Social order was stable, there was no phenomenon of fleeing famine, and there was no epidemic. Let's look at the situation in Linwu County: more than 40 years ago, according to the "Brief Table of Famine Victims Starved to Death" published in "Xiang Disaster Monthly," 89 people starved to death in this county. Last year, this county also suffered from drought, but in the villages where many people had starved to death in the past, farmers relied on cooperatives to do a good job in production, and many cooperatives increased production. Not a single person starved to death in the county, and not a single person fled the famine.

    The broad masses of farmers have personally witnessed the great power displayed by collectivization. In the rural areas of Hunan, one can often hear such words: "With cooperatives, big disasters become small disasters, and small disasters become no disasters!" When an old farmer in his seventies from the Youhao Agricultural Cooperative in Guozhen Township, Yueyang County, talked about last year's drought resistance and disaster relief, he repeatedly said: "Such achievements can be inscribed on a monument! Can be inscribed on a monument!"

    On the same day, "New Hunan Daily" also published a commentary entitled "Facts Speak Louder Than Words." After affirming the great achievements in agricultural production in 1956, the commentary wrote: It should be admitted that there were some shortcomings in rural work in 1956, but no matter how many shortcomings there are, resolutely taking the socialist road is thousands of times better than taking the capitalist road! The commentary concluded by saying that the shortcomings in work will be quickly corrected, the socialist system will surely be consolidated, and victory will be achieved!

### 在几十年来少见的大旱面前，农业合作化表现出无比的威力

    在几十年来少见的大旱面前，农业合作化表现出无比的威力
    翻开1956年12月26日的新湖南报，人们会看到第二版整整一个版刊登着惊心动魄的材料。这个版用大量的无可争辩的事实告诉读者：在解放前几十年的黑暗岁月里，连年不断的水旱等自然灾害，曾经给全省人民带来多么浩大的苦难；而在1956年，几十年来少见的大旱，却是怎样地被英雄的人民战胜了。
    在解放前的几十年里，湖南省的受灾情况是怎样的呢？这一期的新湖南报第二版转载了过去几十年出版的“湖南大公报”“湘灾月刊”“湖南通俗日报”等旧报刊发表过的大量材料。这里有具体介绍连年不断的水、旱、虫灾情的报道，有惨不忍睹的“湖南饥民图”和“饥民饿毙略表”，有军阀吴佩孚向“海内仁人君子、慈悲大家”发出的“请赈电”的原文。但是，在那个反动统治的年代，有谁能真正帮助人民有效地向灾害进行斗争呢？这些旧时代的报刊也只能在描写了受灾农村“野有饿殍，民多流亡”的凄惨景象之后，无可奈何地发出“哀我小民，何辜罹此”的伤叹。
    但是，在人民当家的时代，特别是在千千万万的农民组织起农业生产合作社的时候，人民在自然灾害面前就再也不是束手无策的了。依靠共产党和政府的英明领导，依靠集体经济的巨大力量，广大农民完全能够按照自己的意志把严重的自然灾害彻底消除或大大缩小。新湖南报在一篇综合性的报道中写道：1956年湖南遭受了近几十年来没有过的大旱灾，从6月到12月下旬，持续一百七十天到一百八十天全省没有下过普遍的透雨。许多地方塘干井枯，溪涧断流，连人们吃的水都要由农业社生产队长一杓一杓地分配。但是，就在这样严重的干旱威胁下，全省稻谷产量仍达二百亿斤左右，只比丰收的1955年减少三十亿斤；而棉花、黄麻、苎麻、茶叶、茶油、桐油、柑桔、油料、生猪的产量，都比1955年增加了。全省原有的九万多个农业社中，有四万多个增加了生产。全省农副业生产总值达到1955年的90％以上。
    1955年春季，湖南省基本上实现了初级的农业合作化。依靠合作化的伟大力量，从1955年冬到1956年春，全省完成水利工程八十二万处，增加了灌溉面积一百四十八万多亩；积土肥八十多亿担，比上一年增加二倍以上；双季稻由五百三十多万亩扩大到一千二百五十万亩；在农业生产中推广了许多新的技术。在抗旱斗争中，全省出动了三百多万人，先后出动了水车一百万架，许多地方，用十几梯以至二十梯车翻山越岭车水浇田。现在，全省大部分农业社的收益分配工作已经基本结束。在增产和保产的社中，绝大多数社员都增加了收入。
    请看重灾区之一的岳阳县的情况吧。这个县发生了近二百天的大旱，全县四十五个乡中有十八个受灾减产。但是，尽管这样，全县农民还是有足够的全年口粮（除杂粮外，留粮最少的社每人还有粮食四百五十斤左右）。社会秩序安定，没有逃荒现象，也没有疫病的流行。再看临武县的情况：四十多年前，据“湘灾月刊”所载“饥民饿毙略表”统计，这个县饿死了八十九人。去年，这个县也受了旱，但是，在当年曾经有不少人饿死的村庄，农民依靠合作社把生产搞得很好，许多社都增加了生产。全县没有一人饿死，没有一人逃荒。
    广大农民亲眼看到了合作化所显示的伟大力量。在湖南农村中，常常可以听到这样的话：“有了合作社，大灾化小灾，小灾化无灾！”岳阳县郭镇乡友好农业社一个七十多岁的老农一谈到去年的抗旱、救灾，就连声地说：“这样的功绩，可以立碑！可以立碑！”
    新湖南报在同日还发表了题为“事实胜于雄辩”的评论。评论在肯定了1956年农业生产上的巨大成绩以后写道：应该承认，1956年农村工作中是有一些缺点的，但不管有多少条缺点，坚决走社会主义道路，比走资本主义道路，总要强过千百倍！评论最后说，工作中的缺点一定会很快地得到改正，社会主义制度一定能够巩固，胜利！
