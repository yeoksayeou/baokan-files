Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 7th - "Al-Ahram" commented on the US Middle East plan on the 6th, saying that the United States should not use its aid as a weapon in the Cold War. The newspaper said that the principle of neutrality accepted by Middle Eastern countries would not be affected because they are determined to adhere to their neutrality, regardless of whether they receive US aid.

　　"Al-Gomhouria" editor Anwar Sadat raised two questions to the US President in the newspaper on the 6th. He said, first, if Egypt is subjected to aggression by NATO and Israel, what position will the United States take? Second, if Israel or certain NATO countries attack Arab countries, and if a country that Eisenhower considers to be "controlled by international communism" provides assistance at the request of the attacked country, what will be the US reaction to this situation?

　　"Egyptian Mail" said on the 5th that if the United States takes any action to send troops to any part of the Middle East against the will of the governments concerned, it will naturally put it in exactly the same position as Britain and France are now in the eyes of the Arabs.

　　The newspaper pointed out to US congressmen that Eden had also used the need to defeat the "Communist conspiracy" as an excuse for attacking Egypt. It said, however, "there is no evidence of any such conspiracy, either before or after the Anglo-French action."

　　The newspaper said that Americans should remember that most Arab countries oppose concluding any treaties, alliances or other agreements that would link them with either of the two blocs in the world.

　　It said that these countries are not communist countries, but they still maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union and other Eastern countries. It said that these countries currently maintain friendly relations with the United States. The newspaper warned that if the United States wants to maintain friendship with Arab countries, it must not force Arab countries to accept its views by force or other means, nor should it try to force Arab countries to sever normal relations with other countries through threats or promises.

　　"Al Misaa" editor Khaled Mohieddin wrote in the newspaper that Egypt and other Arab countries will strive to maintain neutrality, as this is the only way to guarantee peace, freedom and prosperity.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 7th - Damascus News: Damascus Radio commented on US President Eisenhower's Middle East policy message on January 6, saying that the message did not determine what policy the United States would take if Britain, France, and Israel carried out aggression, as happened in Egypt, Algeria, and Yemen.

　　The radio broadcast pointed out that Eisenhower's claim of a "Communist threat" in the Middle East was not in accordance with the facts.

　　"Al Nour" said on the same day that Eisenhower's message "should be regarded as a threat of a new armed invasion of the region, the purpose of which is to enslave the people of the region and plunder their wealth. We should continue to prepare to face the coming struggle."

　　Syrian political figures said that any Middle East policy decided without the participation of Arab governments is doomed to failure.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 7th - Amman News: The Jordanian National Front sent a telegram to US President Eisenhower, accusing his Middle East policy of violating the UN Charter and the principles of peaceful coexistence of the Bandung Conference. The telegram said that the threat of the United States using armed forces in the Middle East has aroused resentment against the United States.

　　The National Front is a newly established political party in Jordan, which won three seats in the parliamentary elections in October last year.

    埃叙约舆论抨击美国侵略中东计划
    中东国家坚持中立不受冷战影响
    所谓“共产党威胁”中东的说法是无稽之谈
    新华社开罗7日电　“金字塔报”6日在评论美国的中东计划时说，美国不应该以它的援助来作为它在冷战中的一种武器。这家报纸说，中东国家所接受的中立原则将不会受到影响，因为它们决心坚持它们的中立，不论是否得到美国的援助。
      “共和国报”主编安瓦尔·萨达特6日在这家报纸上向美国总统提出了两个问题。他说，第一，如果埃及遭受北大西洋公约组织和以色列的侵略，美国将采取什么立场？第二，如果以色列或某些北大西洋公约组织的国家进攻阿拉伯国家，并且，如果被艾森豪威尔认为是“受国际共产主义控制”的国家中的一个国家，在受到攻击的国家的请求下援助它们，美国对这种情况将有什么反应？
      “埃及邮报”在5日说，美国如果违反有关国家政府的意志，采取派遣军队到中东任何地区去的任何行动，那就自然而然地会使它处于同现在英法在阿拉伯人眼中所处的完全相同的地位。
    这家报纸向美国的议员们指出，艾登也曾经把有必要挫败“共产党的阴谋”作为进攻埃及的借口。它说，但是，“无论在英法行动以前或以后，都没有证据能证明有任何这种阴谋存在”。
    这家报纸说，美国人应当记住，大多数阿拉伯国家反对缔结任何会把它们和世界上两个集团中的任何一个集团联系在一起的条约、联盟或是其它协定。
    它说，这些国家不是共产党国家，然而它们还是和苏联以及其它东方国家保持了友好关系。它说，这些国家目前同美国也维持着友好关系。这家报纸警告说，如果美国希望维持和阿拉伯国家的友谊，那它就切勿以武力或其它方法强使阿拉伯国家接受它的主张，也不要以威胁或是诺言来企图使阿拉伯国家断绝同其它国家的正常关系。
    “晚报”主编哈立德·毛希丁在这家报纸上写道，埃及和其他阿拉伯国家将努力保持中立，因为这是保证和平、自由和繁荣的唯一办法。
    新华社7日讯　大马士革消息：大马士革电台1月6日评论美国总统艾森豪威尔的中东政策咨文说，这个咨文没有确定，如果发生英、法和以色列进行侵略，就像在埃及以及阿尔及利亚和也门所发生的一样的时候，美国将采取什么政策。
    电台的广播指出，艾森豪威尔所提出的关于中东的“共产党威胁”的说法是不符合事实的。
      “光明报”在同一天说，艾森豪威尔的咨文“应该认为是一种对这个地区的新的武装入侵的威胁，它的目的是要奴役这个地区的人民，掠夺他们的财富。我们应当继续准备面对将要到来的斗争。”
    叙利亚政界人士说，没有有关阿拉伯政府参加而决定的任何中东政策都注定要失败。
    新华社7日讯　安曼消息：约旦全国阵线曾经打电报给美国总统艾森豪威尔，指责他的中东政策违反了联合国宪章和万隆会议的和平共处的原则。电报说，美国可能在中东使用武装部队的威胁激起了人们对美国的愤恨。
    全国阵线是约旦新成立的一个政党，它在去年10月的议会选举中取得了三个席位。
