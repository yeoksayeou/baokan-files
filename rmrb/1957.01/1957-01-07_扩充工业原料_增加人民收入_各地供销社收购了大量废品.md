Expand Industrial Raw Materials, Increase People's Income
Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Various Regions Acquired Large Quantities of Waste Products

    (Our Dispatch) In 1956, supply and marketing cooperatives across the country expanded their purchasing business of waste and used materials, supported national economic construction, and increased the income of the masses.

    Over the year, the total amount of just seven kinds of acquired materials, including scrap copper, waste steel, tin lead, waste rubber, animal bones, rags, and waste cotton, reached 791,800 tons. After processing and utilization, these waste and used materials effectively compensated for the shortage of raw materials in the country's metallurgy, rubber, paper making, chemical, and other industries, greatly reduced production costs, and saved a large amount of new raw materials. For example, in 1956, using rags, waste cotton, broken fishing nets, shoe soles, waste paper, etc. for paper making saved more than 290,000 cubic meters of wood. Animal bones can be rendered into oil; in addition to extracting bone glue for export, sufficient bone meal fertilizer was produced for the application of 10.4 million mu of farmland. The value of waste products acquired nationwide throughout the year could build sixty rubber, paper making, cigarette, or sugar refining factories (calculated by quota unit), equivalent to the value of more than 3 billion jin of grain.

    In purchasing waste products, supply and marketing cooperatives in many areas found ways to tap potential and conduct acquisition deep in urban and rural areas. The variety of managed items increased from 120 to more than 500. In some provinces and cities, such as Liaoning, Beijing, and Shanghai, the variety of managed items reached more than 10,000. Previously unrecyclable items, such as fish scales, used batteries, and cattail bags, have also found solutions after research with production units (fish scales can be used to manufacture glue for the textile and match industries or as fish liver oil capsule shells, photographic film, etc.). Jiangsu Province has already acquired 90,000 jin of fish scales.

    In expanding the acquisition of waste products, many local supply and marketing cooperatives have organized small vendors and peddlers to go from village to village and street to street, "propagating, acquiring, and supplying at the same time," facilitating the masses in selling. After Deng Xiwen, a member of the Chengguan Town Agricultural Cooperative in Minle County, Gansu Province, understood the role of scrap copper and iron in national economic construction, he dug up 13,300 jin of scrap copper that had been buried for twenty-eight years and sold it to the state. In Yong'an County, Fujian, organized barbers went to the countryside carrying cloth bags and collected more than 2,700 jin of human hair in five months. Some agricultural cooperative feeders can earn enough money from collecting miscellaneous hair in a year to buy a mule or a horse.

    The acquisition of waste and used materials plays a considerable role in overcoming material accumulation and meeting social needs. Beijing and Shanghai have acquired 4,541 various motors, engines, automobiles, broken ships, machines, etc., which have been accumulated by various units for a long time. Most of these materials have been repaired and utilized in production and construction. Many units have been relieved of the burden of long-term accumulation of funds because the waste and old equipment could be sold.

    扩充工业原料  增加人民收入
    各地供销社收购了大量废品
    本报讯　1956年，全国各地供销合作社扩大了废旧物资的采购业务，支援了国家经济建设，增加了群众的收入。
    一年来，仅收购的杂铜、废钢铁、锡铅、废橡胶、兽骨、破布、废棉等七种总量即达七十九万一千八百吨。这些废旧物资经过加工利用，有效地补助了国家冶金、橡胶、造纸、化学等工业原料的不足，大大减低了生产成本，节约了大量新的原料。例如，1956年利用破布、废棉、破渔网、鞋底、废纸等造纸，节约了二十九万多立方公尺木材。兽骨可熬油，除了提制骨胶出口外，并生产了足够一千零四十万亩农田施用的骨粉肥料。全年全国收购废品的价值，可建橡胶、造纸、卷烟或制糖工厂六十个，（以限额单位计算）相当三十多亿斤粮食的价值。
    供销合作社在采购废品中，从多方面想办法，挖潜力，深入城乡各地收购，经营品种由一百二十种增加到五百多种。有的省市如辽宁、北京、上海经营品种达到一万多种。过去不能回收利用的鱼鳞、废电池、蒲包等，经过同生产单位研究，也解决了出路问题（鱼鳞可制造纺织、火柴工业用胶或作鱼肝油丸外皮、摄影胶卷等）。江苏省已收购鱼鳞九万斤。
    扩大废品收购中，很多地区供销社都组织小商贩、货郎担串乡串街“边宣传、边收购、边供应”，便利了群众出售。甘肃省民乐县城关镇农业社社员邓希文懂得了杂铜废铁对国家经济建设的作用后，把埋藏二十八年的一万三千三百斤杂铜，挖了出来卖给国家。福建永安县组织起来的理发员下乡带布袋，五个月收集人发二千七百多斤。有的农业社饲养员一年收集杂毛的钱，可买一匹骡或一匹马。
    废旧物资的收购，对于克服物资积压，满足社会需要，有相当的作用。北京、上海两市收购了各单位长期积存的各种马达、引擎、汽车、破船、机器等即达四千五百四十一部，这些物资经修配后已大部利用到生产建设上去。许多单位由于废旧器材得以卖出，就解除了长期积压资金的负担。
