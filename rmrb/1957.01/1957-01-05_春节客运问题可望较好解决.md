Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: This year, due to the adjustment of wages for staff in state organs and factories and mines, the income of employees in joint state-private enterprises has increased, and students enjoy half-price discounts on tickets during winter and summer vacations. With the opening of the free market, the volume of passenger transport during the Spring Festival will increase even more than in previous years. According to estimates from relevant sources, the average daily number of railway passengers during this year's Spring Festival will be around one million, and the daily average may reach 1.3 to 1.4 million in the ten days before the Spring Festival.

In order to properly solve the passenger transport problem during the Spring Festival, the Sixth Office of the State Council convened a meeting of the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Communications, and relevant units as early as December last year to conduct thorough research. Under the instructions of the State Council, various transportation departments are coming up with various effective methods. The Ministry of Railways plans to adopt methods such as using short- and long-distance train sets interchangeably, using some covered wagons and military ambulances to replace passenger cars, selling seated tickets for some sleeper cars, and appropriately overloading. It is estimated that this will allow for the transportation of an additional 400,000 people per day. In addition to strengthening vehicle scheduling and improving vehicle transport efficiency, road transport departments also plan to use some freight cars and request that agencies, enterprises, schools, and military units in various cities appropriately allocate some vehicles to temporarily participate in passenger transport during the Spring Festival. Maritime and river transport departments have also determined to appropriately overload on routes with relatively busy passenger transport during the Spring Festival, and allocate a batch of freighters for temporary modification to participate in passenger transport.

Even so, if all passengers crowd to leave only two or three days before the Spring Festival, and the number of people taking transportation suddenly increases a lot, the transportation departments will still find it difficult to cope. To this end, the State Council has issued instructions requiring provinces and cities to establish temporary offices in major cities with large passenger volumes, led by the Municipal People's Committee and with the participation of railway, transportation departments, and relevant units, to uniformly lead and arrange passenger transport during the Spring Festival. The State Council's instructions also require all localities to stagger the vacation dates of universities, middle schools, and construction workers according to specific circumstances. The transportation of immigrants and demobilized soldiers should be postponed until after the Spring Festival.

After taking the above measures, the passenger transport problem during the Spring Festival may be better resolved. However, due to the large number of passengers during the Spring Festival, the overall transportation capacity of railways, highways, or shipping is still insufficient. Therefore, the relevant departments hope that employees and students in various places will reduce travel as much as possible during the Spring Festival to alleviate the tension in transportation during this period for the country.

### 春节客运问题可望较好解决

    春节客运问题可望较好解决
    据新华社3日讯　今年由于国家机关和厂矿企业工作人员的工资得到了调整，公私合营企业店员的收入有了增加，学生寒暑假购票又实行半价优待的办法，自由市场开放以后，春节的旅客运输量将比往年增加更大。据有关方面估计，今年春节期间铁路平均每天的旅客将有一百万人左右，春节前十天，每天平均可能达到一百三十万至一百四十万人。
    为了妥善地解决春节期间的旅客运输问题，国务院第六办公室早在去年12月间就召集铁道部、交通部同有关单位开会作了缜密的研究。在国务院的指示下，各个交通运输部门正在想出各种有效的办法。铁道部准备采用长短途列车套用、用一部分棚车和军用卫生车代替客车，一部分卧车改售座票和适当超员运载等办法，估计这样每天可以多运四十万人左右。公路运输部门除了加强车辆调度、提高车辆的运输效能以外，还计划使用一部分货车并且请求各个城市的机关、企业、学校和驻军适当抽调一部分汽车来临时参加春节期间的旅客运输。海、河运输部门对春节期间旅客运输比较繁忙的航线，也确定适当超员运载，并抽调一批货轮临时改装，参加客运。
    虽然如此，如果所有的旅客都挤到春节前两三天才走，坐车人数突然增加很多，交通部门仍然是难以应付的。为此，国务院已经发出指示，要求各省、市应该在客运量较大的主要城市，以市人民委员会为主，吸收铁路、交通部门和有关单位参加，成立临时办公室，以统一领导和安排春节期间的旅客运输工作。国务院的指示还要求各地根据具体情况错开大、中学校和建筑工人的放假日期。移民和复员军人的运送工作都要推迟到春节以后再进行。
    采取上述这些措施以后，春节期间的旅客运输问题可能会得到较好的解决。但是由于春节期间旅客数量很大，无论铁路、公路或航运，总的来说运力仍然不足。因此有关部门希望各地的职工群众和学生在春节期间还要尽可能减少旅行，为国家减轻这个时期运输紧张的程度。
