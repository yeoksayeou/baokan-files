    "Nixing" of Qinzhou
    Chen Moren
    Qinzhou, Guangdong, is famous at home and abroad for producing "Nixing" – ceramic handicrafts.
    Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Qinzhou's "Nixing" was mainly sold in Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia, with some sales in Europe. At that time, Qinzhou had a Nixing Street with more than 40 shops selling "Nixing" and more than 200 craftsmen. According to old artisans, the earliest trial production of Nixing in Qinzhou was in the early years of the Xianfeng period of the Qing Dynasty. It is said that after a purple clay teapot from Yixing County, Jiangsu Province, was brought to Qinzhou, people began to learn to imitate it. Because this kind of pottery was introduced from Yixing, it was initially called "Yixing." The pronunciation of "Ni" and "Yi" are similar in Cantonese, so later "Nixing" gradually became the specific name for this type of pottery.
    To make "Nixing," two kinds of soil must be used: one from Shuangjiao Ridge in the east of the Qin River, called East Mud; and one from Gaotou Ridge in the west of the Qin River, called West Mud. East Mud has a sticky texture, while West Mud has a hard texture. From taking the mud, refining the mud, making the blank, carving, to the final processing and polishing after firing, a slight oversight in each production link will render all efforts futile. "Nixing" must be placed in the middle of jars, urns, and earthenware casseroles, covered well, and placed in the kiln for firing. The fire is extinguished after about fourteen hours, and it can be taken out after another eight or nine hours.
    The color of "Nixing" is rich and varied, and it is smooth and shiny after polishing, which is different from the purple clay pottery of Yixing, Jiangsu. After being fired, the soil here has colors such as bronze and lychee kernel, as well as various shades of sea blue, begonia red, and speckled white and gray; some are ancient and elegant, some are gorgeous and generous, and some are bright and shiny. A light tap will produce a sonorous metallic sound. The main products are tea sets and vases. The tea sets come in shapes such as peaches, papayas, and horseshoe; the vases come in shapes such as swallowtails, begonias, and lotus leaves. Most are six inches to one foot high. However, there are also two-foot-tall square and round double-layered openwork vases, which are more valuable. The unique advantages of "Nixing" are: if you cut peach and plum branches and insert them into a vase, they can blossom and bear fruit; tea stored in a "Nixing" teapot will not change its flavor even after a year. Therefore, in 1919, "Nixing" won a second-place gold medal at the Panama International Arts and Crafts Fair; it also won an award of excellence at the Belgian Centennial Independence Exposition in 1929.
    The once-flourishing Qinzhou "Nixing" was completely destroyed by the Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and most of the artists were displaced. At that time, some people fled to Mong Cai in Vietnam to make "Nixing," but it was difficult to transport the mud back from Qinzhou, so production stopped in less than a year. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, "Nixing" workers wanted to resume production, but the Kuomintang reactionary government did not pay attention to this national craft. Many "Nixing" workers died one after another in poverty and unemployment. Today, there are very few remaining "Nixing" workers. There is only one old artist, Yan Ganqing, who knows how to use a lathe, and only a few old artists, such as Pan Jingguang, Li Zhaoyun, and Li Qiquan, who know how to carve. In order to save this "Nixing" craft that is about to be lost, the local People's Committee has sought out more than a dozen new and old craftsmen, organized them, allocated funds to purchase tools, and built factories to resume production in Gangwayao Village, eight li near Qinzhou. Production began in November last year, and the first kiln of "Nixing" was fired. Now, the first batch of "Nixing" products has been placed in the department store in Qinzhou County. Relevant departments are organizing exports.

### 钦州的“坭兴”

    钦州的“坭兴”
    陈摩人
    广东钦州以出产“坭兴”——陶瓷工艺品而闻名中外。
    抗日战争前，钦州“坭兴”主要销售在越南、马来亚、印度尼西亚一带，部分销到欧洲。那时钦州有一条坭兴街，设有四十多家经营“坭兴”的商店，手工艺人有二百多。据老艺人谈，钦州最早试制坭兴是在清咸丰初年，传说是江苏省宜兴县的紫砂茶壶被人带到钦州后，便有人开始学习仿制；因为这种陶器是从宜兴传来的，起初称“宜兴”。“坭”与“宜”在粤语中语音相近，后来渐渐就以“坭兴”作为这种陶器的专门名称了。
    制造“坭兴”，必须用两种泥土，一在钦江之东的双角岭，称为东泥；一在钦江之西?头岭，称为西泥。东泥质地胶粘，西泥质地坚硬。从取泥、炼泥、做坯、雕刻到烧成后的加工磨制，每一个制作环节稍一疏忽便会全功尽弃。“坭兴”必须放在缸、坛、瓦煲等的中间，盖好后放入窑中一起烧，经过十四个小时左右才熄火，再隔八、九个小时便可取出了。
    “坭兴”的色泽是丰富多采的，而且磨制后油滑光洁，这是同江苏宜兴的紫砂陶器不同的地方。这里的土质经烧炼后，除有古铜、荔枝核等颜色外，还有海蓝、海棠红、渗白渗灰等种种色调；有的古雅，有的华丽大方，有的鲜艳光亮。轻轻敲打会发出铿锵的金属声。主要产品是茶具和花瓶。茶具的式样有桃子、木瓜、马蹄等形状的；花瓶的式样有燕尾、海棠、莲叶等形状的。大都是六寸至一尺高。但也有二尺多高的方形和圆形的双层镂空花瓶，那是比较名贵的。“坭兴”的独特优点是：折桃李花枝，插在花瓶内能开花结果；用“坭兴”茶壶盛茶一年也不变味。因此1919年“坭兴”在巴拿马国际工艺产品赛会上，曾获得第二名金牌奖章；在1929年比利时独立百周年的工艺品博览会上也获得优胜奖。
    极盛一时的钦州“坭兴”，在抗日战争中被日寇摧残无遗，艺人大都流离他乡。当时曾有部分人逃到越南的芒街做“坭兴”，但要回到钦州来取泥，运输困难，不到一年也就停顿了。抗日胜利后，“坭兴”工人们曾想恢复生产，但国民党反动政府并不重视这种民族工艺，在贫困和失业中，很多“坭兴”工人相继去世了。到今天，剩下的“坭兴”工人寥寥无几，会车工的只有老艺人颜干卿一人，会雕刻的老艺人也仅有潘镜光、李照允、黎启铨等几个人。当地人民委员会为了挽救这即将失传的“坭兴”工艺，便寻访了十多个新、老手工艺人，把他们组织起来，拨了款项购置了工具，兴修了厂房，在钦州附近八华里的缸瓦窑村恢复了生产。去年11月开始生产，烧出了第一窑“坭兴”。现在钦州县城的百货公司门市部，已摆上了第一批“坭兴”产品。有关部门正在组织出口。
