    A factory assembled entirely from old machines and producing entirely from scrap materials—the Tianjin Cotton Blanket Factory—produced more than 142,000 cotton blankets last year, which are popular with consumers. These blankets have been sold to more than 30 places, including the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Harbin, and Shanghai. This year, the factory has received orders exceeding its production capacity.
    In 1954, during the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign, relevant departments in Tianjin designated personnel to collect incomplete machines about to be disposed of from weaving, dyeing, wool textile, and canvas factories. After a year of renovation and testing, the cotton blanket factory was established at the end of 1955, and began to use scraps and waste materials left over from making fleece garments and rubber shoes to produce cotton blankets. Because the machines were originally used for producing wool textiles and were not entirely suitable for producing cotton blankets, the workers added wooden covers to the carding and spinning machines to prevent cotton fibers from flying away as the machines rotated. Furthermore, based on the fact that the fibers of the scraps were relatively short, they adopted the method of directly twisting cotton strips and then weaving cotton blankets, making the blankets more durable and the cost of cotton blankets lower.
    This year, in addition to recycling scraps and waste materials from the Tianjin Knitting Factory and the Tianjin Cotton Textile and other systems, the factory has also sent people to Zhengzhou to recycle waste materials, and at the same time renovate some old machines. In this way, this year's output will increase by about 100% compared to last year.

    一个用旧机器和废料生产的工厂
    一个全部用旧机器装配的、并且全部利用废料进行生产的工厂——天津市棉毯厂，去年生产了十四万二千多条受到消费者欢迎的棉毯，这些棉毯已经行销到内蒙古自治区和哈尔滨、上海等三十多个地方。今年，这个工厂接到的订货又超过了自己的生产能力。
    在1954年，开展增产节约运动的时候，天津市有关部门指定专人收集织染、毛织、帆布等厂中将要处理的残缺不全的机器，经过一年的装修、试验，在1955年底成立了棉毯工厂，开始利用做绒衣、胶鞋等留下的下脚料和废料生产棉毯。由于机器都是生产毛织品用的，不完全适合生产棉毯，职工们就在梳纺机上加了木罩，使棉纤维不会随着机器的转动飞跑，并且根据下脚料纤维比较短的情况，采取棉条直接加捻后编织棉毯的办法，使毯子更结实，棉毯的成本也不高。
    今年，这个工厂除了回收天津市针织厂和天津市棉纺等系统中的下脚料和废料以外，还派人去郑州回收废料，同时再装修一部分旧机器。这样，今年的产量将比去年增加一倍左右。
