Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 6th - The Sichuan Provincial People's Committee convened a meeting of the heads of various provincial-level units under its jurisdiction on the 5th to study the issue of carrying out streamlining and thrift in each unit, and made several regulations on this issue.

The first regulation of the Provincial People's Committee is that the number of existing personnel in the provincial-level agencies under its jurisdiction should be reduced by 30% to reinforce the lower levels. All temporary or similar institutions that can be streamlined should be reduced, merged, or abolished in a practical and realistic manner according to different circumstances.

The second regulation is that each unit should vigorously reduce various meetings. Meetings that can be held or not held should be resolutely canceled, meetings that can be merged should be held jointly, and meetings that must be held should be fully prepared to shorten the time as much as possible. No meals will be served at any type of meeting.

The Provincial People's Committee also stipulated that unnecessary documents, telegrams, reports, and publications should be reduced as much as possible. Regarding the housing issue of various agencies, the principle is that no new buildings will be built. Existing buildings should be gradually adjusted appropriately based on the principle of economical use of housing, or be repaired and renovated on the original basis through simple and crude methods to increase housing. The purchase of cars, sofas, etc., should be stopped from now on, and the purchase of general furniture should also be stopped in principle. Surplus furniture should be gradually adjusted for use.

In addition, the Provincial People's Committee also made specific regulations on the establishment and use of vehicles, telecommunications fees, office expenses, and cadres traveling by plane.

    四川省人民委员会
    规定精简节约几项原则
    新华社成都6日电　四川省人民委员会5日召集所属各省级单位的负责人研究在各单位中开展精简节约的问题，并且就这一问题作出了几项规定。
    省人民委员会的第一项规定是所属各省级机关要减少现有人数的30％，以充实下层。一切可以精简的临时性的或性质相近的机构，都应分别不同情况，实事求是地加以紧缩、合并或裁撤。
    第二项规定是各单位要大力减少各种会议。可开可不开的会议就坚决不开，可以合并的会议就合并召开，必需召开的会议，也应充分作好准备，尽量缩短时间。不论开何种会议，一律停止会餐。
    省人民委员会还规定要尽量减少不必要的公文、电报、报表和刊物。关于各机关的房屋问题，原则上规定不再新建，对现有房屋应本节约用房的原则逐步进行适当调整，或在原有基础上采取因陋就简的方法加以培修和改建，以增加住房。汽车、沙发等今后应停止购买，一般家具原则上也不再添置，多余的家具应当逐步调剂使用。
    此外，省人民委员会还对汽车的编制和使用、电讯费、办公费、干部乘坐飞机等，作了具体的规定。
