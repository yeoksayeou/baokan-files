    Thoughts on Visiting the Lu Xun Museum
    Ma Tieding
    Due to various matters, it was only recently that I finally visited the Lu Xun Museum.

    In the museum, I saw many of Lu Xun's original works: "Collection of Tang and Song Dynasty Legends," "Ji Kang Collection," "Gleanings of Ancient Novels"... volume after volume, all meticulously copied in tiny regular script with a brush, character by character.

    In 1930, Zuo Lian writers Rou Shi and others were arrested. Rou Shi sent a letter from prison, written in pencil. Because it was from prison, both sides of the paper were written on. Lu Xun pasted this letter on a piece of paper and meticulously transcribed it in neat brushstrokes beside it...

    In short: whether from Lu Xun's handwritten copies, original manuscripts, or manuscripts he revised for others, that simple, rigorous, and meticulously crafted work style was completely consistent.

    I thought to myself: The Great Wall is magnificent, it requires bricks to be piled up one by one; the Grand Canal is spectacular, it requires shovelful after shovelful of earth to be dug.

    If one marvels at and yearns for the greatness of the Great Wall and the magnificence of the Grand Canal, but is unwilling to do the work of laying bricks and digging earth, then any beautiful wish will forever remain a fantasy.

    Lu Xun's value lies in his not refusing and even enjoying doing the work of laying bricks and digging earth, and always doing it so well! Solid and meticulous, without the slightest carelessness!

    The "tenacity" that Lu Xun spoke of is not only manifested in the struggle against the enemy, but also in daily, seemingly trivial work.

    Using the sunshine of ideals to illuminate our eyes, and also using firm footsteps to walk towards the ideal goal, Lu Xun gives us a genius's inspiration in this regard.

    看鲁迅博物馆有感
    马铁丁
    由于种种事情，一直拖延到最近，才去看了一次鲁迅博物馆。
    在博物馆里看到了不少鲁迅的真迹：唐宋传奇集、稽康集、古小说钩沉……一厚本、一厚本，硬是蝇头小楷，用毛笔一个个字抄下来的。
    1930年左翼作家柔石等被捕，柔石从狱中寄出来一封信，铅笔写的。因为是狱中，一张纸正反写了两面。鲁迅把这封信贴在一张纸上，又在旁边用毛笔工整地把它誊过一遍……
    总之：不论从鲁迅的手抄本中、原稿中、替别人修改的稿件中，那种朴质、严谨、精功的工作作风浑然一体。
    我想想：万里长城是伟大的，它需要一块块砖来垒起来；大运河是壮观的，它需要一铲铲的挖土。
    警叹和向往万里长城的伟大，大运河的壮观，但不愿做垒砖和挖土的工作，那么，任何美丽的愿望，都只能永远是个幻梦。
    鲁迅的可贵，在于他不拒绝而且乐于做垒砖、挖土的工作，总是做得那么好！扎扎实实，一丝不苟！
    鲁迅所说的“韧”，不但表现在对敌人的斗争中，也表现在日常的、看起来是琐细的工作中。
    用理想的阳光照亮我们的眼睛，又用坚实的脚步向理想的目标走去，关于这，鲁迅给我们以天才的启示。
