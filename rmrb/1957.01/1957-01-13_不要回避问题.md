Do Not Avoid Problems
Song Zheng

The Party organization of the Jiangsu Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative encountered an obstacle after mobilizing all Party members to do mass work. Some Party members who held administrative leadership positions became impatient, saying, "It's better not to connect; the more we connect, the more problems there are." This Party organization persuaded these comrades, and the work of connecting with the masses was not affected by this idea. However, the idea of "being afraid of too many problems" still plagued many comrades, preventing them from striding forward.

Some comrades would rather sit in the office reading reports and approving official documents than go to grassroots organizations and the masses, to avoid lower-level cadres and the masses directly raising many problems. Some comrades, although they sometimes go down to take a look, will find ways to avoid problems and try not to touch the various complex and difficult things in reality, to avoid being bothered by these problems.

Some comrades, because they dislike the harassment of problems, always listen to good news and not bad news when lower-level comrades report on their work. When assigning tasks to lower levels, they only like lower-level cadres to pat their chests and guarantee the completion of the task, and do not like them to raise problems or difficulties.

Some comrades seem not to dislike others raising problems, but they also have their "wonderful tricks" for dealing with problems. I once listened to a Party committee reporting meeting in a factory. At this meeting, several branch secretaries unanimously pointed out that there were many difficulties in promoting a certain work system among technical personnel, implying that they hoped the leaders could help solve them. However, when the Party committee secretary gave instructions at the end, he talked a lot about the problems that the branches had already figured out, but avoided talking about this problem that everyone was troubled by, and only asked to "continue to implement" this system. I have carefully read a year's work plan of a factory Party committee. According to the Party committee secretary, the most important problem in the factory at that time was to strengthen technical management. Party workers felt unable to lead and supervise this work because they did not understand technology and were not familiar with technical personnel. However, in the Party committee's work plan, it only repeatedly emphasized the importance of technical management, repeatedly saying that the Party organization should "deeply lead," "effectively strengthen," and "earnestly supervise," but the question of how to lead was not answered. Many of our comrades have "slipped" past in this way from "problems."

Recently, Party leading organs at all levels have sent a large number of cadres to go deep into the grassroots to promote work, which is a very good phenomenon. This shows that many Party leading organs are determined to change the situation where a large number of cadres sit in the office and do not contact practical problems. However, if the cadres sent down still "walk around the problems" or "slip" past the problems, it will be difficult for them to truly contact problems and solve problems, and it will naturally be difficult to help the leading organs. Recently, it has been discovered in individual places that after the working groups go down, they only hold meetings from the prefectural committee to the county committee to the township... to convey the intentions of the leaders level by level. This is a very noteworthy phenomenon.

Life is not a pool of stagnant water, and the contradictions and conflicts in life will not stop for a moment. No matter how afraid some comrades are of problems, there will always be problems. Moreover, as soon as the old ones are resolved, new ones arise. This is something that no dialectical materialist would deny. It should be reminded to those comrades who like a peaceful life, since problems exist, if you do not actively search for and discover them, they will come to you; when problems come to you, you will not only be passive, but also run the risk of being thrown to the side of the mainstream of life.

    不要回避问题
    宋琤
    江苏省供销合作总社的党组织，在发动全体党员做群众工作以后，曾经遇到一个障碍。一些担任行政领导工作的党员不耐烦了，他们说：“不联系还好，越联系反而问题越多。”这个党组织说服了这些同志，联系群众的工作也没有受这种想法的影响。可是，“害怕问题多”的想法还在缠扰着不少同志，使他们不能迈开大步走路。
    有些同志，宁愿坐在机关里看汇报、批公文，而不愿到基层组织到群众中去，免得下边的干部和群众直接提出许许多多问题；有些同志虽然有时也下去看看，但是，他们下去后会想办法绕开问题走，尽量不去接触现实中各种复杂繁难的事物，免得碰到这些问题烦扰自己。
    有些同志，因为讨厌问题的袭扰，在下边同志汇报工作的时候，总是听喜不听忧；给下边布置任务的时候，也是只喜欢下边干部拍胸膛保证完成任务，而不喜欢他们提出问题提出困难。
    有些同志看来似乎并不讨厌别人提出问题，可是，他们也有他们对付问题的“妙诀”。我曾经旁听过一个工厂的党委汇报会议。在这个会议上，几位支部书记一致提出在技术人员中推行某种工作制度有许多困难，言外之意希望领导能够帮助解决。而党委书记在最后作指示时，对各支部已经摸到头绪的问题谈了不少，对这个大家感到苦恼的问题却撇开不谈，只是要求“继续贯彻”这个制度。我仔细看过一个工厂党委会一年的工作计划。据党委书记谈，这个厂当时最主要的问题是加强技术管理。党的工作人员因为不懂技术，不熟悉技术人员而感到无法对这件工作进行领导和监督。而在党委会的工作计划中，却只是一再强调技术管理的重要性，翻来复去的讲党组织应该“深入领导”、“切实加强”、“认真监督”，至于究竟如何领导，那就得不到回答了。我们有很多同志就是这样地从“问题”上边“滑”了过去。
    最近，各级党的领导机关都派出大批干部，深入基层去推动工作，这是很好的现象。这说明，许多党的领导机关都决心改变大批干部坐在办公室里不接触实际问题的状况。可是，如果派下去的干部仍然是“绕着问题走”，或者还是从问题上“滑”过去，他们也就很难真正接触问题解决问题，对领导机关自然也很难有所帮助。最近，个别地方已经发现工作组下去以后，只是从地委到县委到乡……逐级开会传达领导意图。这是很值得注意的现象。
    生活不是一潭死水，生活中的矛盾和冲突一刻也不会停止。不管有些同志多么害怕问题，问题总是要有的。而且，旧的刚刚解决，新的就又发生了。这是任何一个辩证唯物主义者都不会否认的事情。应该提醒这些喜欢风平浪静的生活的同志们，问题既然存在，你不去主动地寻找和发现它们，它们就会来找你；等到问题找来的时候，你就不但会要被动，而且有被抛到生活主流的旁边的危险。
