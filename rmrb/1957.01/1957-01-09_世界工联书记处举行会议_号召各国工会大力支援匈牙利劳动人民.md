Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 8th: The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) issued a communique on January 7th stating that the WFTU Secretariat held a meeting in Prague on January 4th and 5th to discuss the issue of helping the Hungarian working people and trade unions. Representatives from the central trade union organizations of Hungary, the Soviet Union, France, Poland, Italy, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Romania, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Albania, and Luxembourg participated in the meeting.

After discussions, the representatives adopted a plan of support drafted by the WFTU Secretariat and the Hungarian National Federation of Free Trade Unions.

The meeting participants spoke about the assistance provided by the WFTU and its affiliated national trade union organizations to the Hungarian working people and expressed their belief that the Hungarian workers, who are currently completing important tasks, will be able to establish a normal economic life in their own country.

The communique went on to say that it is necessary to emphasize that trade unions in all countries must play a particularly important role in organizing large-scale support for the Hungarian working people in their struggle at various enterprises. The attendees pointed out that actions should be taken to provide material assistance to Hungarian children, especially by sending them food and clothing, and inviting them to the people's democratic countries. Great efforts should also be made to organize the return to their country of the thousands of children who have left Hungary.

The meeting believed that proactive measures should be taken to provide spiritual assistance to the Hungarian working people and trade unions, so that trade union representatives who deliver donations can establish direct contact with the Hungarian working people, strengthen the relationship between the WFTU-affiliated trade union organizations and the Hungarian trade unions, send representatives from these trade union organizations to study the events that have occurred there and exchange opinions, and exchange articles between trade union newspapers. Contact should also be established with Hungarian refugees to inform them of the actual situation in Hungary, the activities of the government and trade unions, in order to prevent them from becoming tools for purposes opposed to the working class and against the solidarity of the international working class.

The communique finally emphasized that material and spiritual assistance to the Hungarian people and trade unions will be further strengthened in the future.

    公报接着说，有必要强调指出，所有国家的工会必须在组织各企业大规模声援匈牙利劳动人民的斗争中起特别重要的作用。到会者指出，应当采取行动给匈牙利儿童提供物质援助，特别是给他们送去食物、衣服，并且邀请他们去人民民主国家。还应当进行巨大努力，组织离开匈牙利的数以千计的儿童回国。
    会议认为，应当在对匈牙利劳动人民和工会给予精神援助方面采取主动行动，以便送交捐赠品的各工会代表同匈牙利劳动人民建立直接接触，加强属于世界工联的各工会组织同匈牙利的工会之间的关系，派遣这些工会组织的代表去研究那里过去发生的事件和交换意见，各工会报纸互相交换文章。并且还应当同匈牙利难民建立接触，以便告诉他们匈牙利的实际情况，政府和工会的活动，以防止他们变成反对工人阶级和反对国际工人阶级团结的目的的工具。
