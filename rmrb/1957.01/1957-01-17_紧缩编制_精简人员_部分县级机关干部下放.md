Streamlining Organizations, Reducing Staff
Some County-Level Cadres Transferred Downward

(Our Newspaper reports) Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, has begun streamlining its county-level institutions and transferring the first group of cadres to strengthen leadership at the grassroots level. The institutions slated for abolishment are the Department of Finance and Trade and the Department of Industry and Transportation. The Department of Propaganda and the Department of Culture and Education are to be merged into the Department of Propaganda and Education. The Department of Rural Work and the United Front Work Department will not have full-time ministers, but will be concurrently held by the County Party Secretary and the County Head, respectively. Each bureau under the County People's Committee will retain only one director. Thus, the first group of cadres to be transferred downward amounts to 102 people. This includes fourteen county-level cadres (including two county heads), fifty-two district-level cadres, and thirty-six general cadres.

Among the transferred cadres, members of the County Party Committee will serve as the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of grassroots Party committees, key district-level cadres will also serve as Deputy Secretaries, and general district-level cadres will serve as members of the Party Committee. The remaining cadres will, based on their specific conditions, serve as township cadres or as full-time branch secretaries in cooperatives.

(Our Newspaper reports) The Jin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Liaoning Province, has transferred 130 cadres to strengthen grassroots leadership in townships, in order to consolidate the victory of agricultural cooperation and strengthen specific leadership in agricultural production. By January 4, 118 cadres had arrived in various townships to take on their new tasks. Among these cadres, there are eighteen deputy ministers of the County Party Committee and deputy section-chief level cadres of the organs, and fifty secretaries and members of the District Party Committee.

This action by the Jin County Party Committee and other units was decided based on the actual situation in Jin County's rural areas and the needs of agricultural production development. After Jin County achieved agricultural cooperation in the spring of last year, the establishment of county-level organs was expanded, and almost all the main cadres from the districts were transferred to work at the county level. In this way, the leadership strength at the grassroots level in rural areas was greatly weakened. The cadres transferred this time were carefully selected by the County Party Committee. They all have long-term experience in rural work, are familiar with the situation, can endure hardship, and can integrate with the masses. (Liao Xin)

(Our Newspaper reports) In order to overcome subjectivism and bureaucratic work styles and strengthen specific leadership over agricultural cooperation, the Fushan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shandong Province, has decided to transfer 85 cadres to strengthen grassroots organizations. Among these 85 cadres, there is one Deputy County Head, eight Deputy Ministers of the County Party Committee, twenty-three section chiefs and bureau directors of the People's Committee, and forty-eight district-level and equivalent cadres. These cadres will be assigned to serve as secretaries or deputy secretaries of grassroots Party committees, or as township heads or deputy township heads, etc.

On January 2, the Fushan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a mobilization meeting of more than 100 people. At the meeting, the comrades who were transferred expressed that after going down, they would ensure close unity with the broad masses of commune members and do a good job in the work of the agricultural cooperative. The comrades who remained in the county expressed their determination to transform their work style, improve their leadership methods, improve work efficiency, and shoulder all the tasks of the county-level organs.

    紧缩编制　精简人员
    部分县级机关干部下放
    本报讯　江西省永新县的县级机构已开始精简，并抽调了第一批干部充实基层领导。已经决定撤销的机构有财经贸易部和工业交通部，宣传部和文教部决定合并为宣教部，农村工作部和统战部不设专职部长，由县委书记和县长分别兼任，县人民委员会的各局只留一个局长。这样，决定第一批下放的干部就有一百零二人。其中有县级干部十四名（其中有两名县长），区级干部五十二名，一般干部三十六名。
    在被抽调的干部中，县委委员将担任基层党委的正、副书记，主要区级干部也将担任副书记，一般区级干部任党委委员。其余一些干部，将根据他们的具体条件，充任乡干部或担任合作社里的专职支部书记。

    本报讯　中共辽宁省金县委员会，抽调一百三十名干部充实乡的基层领导，以巩固农业合作化的胜利，加强农业生产的具体领导。到1月4日，已有一百一十八名干部到各乡接受了新任务。这些干部中，有十八名中共县委副部长和机关副科长级干部，有五十名中共区委书记和区委委员。
    中共金县县委等单位的这一行动，是根据当前金县农村的实际状况和农业生产发展的需要而决定的。去年春季金县实现了农业合作化以后，由于扩大了县级机关的编制，将区里的主要干部几乎全部调到县里来工作。这样，农村基层的领导力量就大大地削弱了。这次抽调的干部，都是经过县委认真选拔的。他们都有长期作农村工作的经验，熟悉情况，能吃苦，能和群众打成一片。　（辽　信）
    本报讯　为了克服工作中的主观主义和官僚主义作风，加强对农业合作化的具体领导，中共山东福山县委会决定抽调八十五名干部充实基层组织。在这八十五名干部中，有副县长一人、县委副部长八人、人民委员会科长、局长二十三人，区级和相当于区级的干部四十八人。这些干部，将被分配到基层党委担任正、副书记，或正、副乡长等职务。
      1月2日，中共福山县委会召开了百余人的动员大会。会上，被抽调的同志表示：下去后，保证和广大社员紧密地团结在一起，搞好农业社的工作。留在县里的工作同志表示：决心转变工作作风，改进领导方法，提高工作效率，把县级机关的任务全部担负起来。
