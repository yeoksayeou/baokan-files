Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd. The Ministry of Supervision held its Sixth National Supervisory Work Conference from December 21st to 31st last year.

The conference summarized the work of 1956 and determined the central task of national supervisory organs for 1957. This central task is: In accordance with the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, to strengthen supervision of all levels of state administrative organs, institutions, and enterprise management organs and their staff to comprehensively complete the first Five-Year Plan, and actively prepare for the second Five-Year Plan. To this end, all levels of state supervisory organs and all supervisory personnel must earnestly abide by what was pointed out in the political report of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, should give full play to their due role in the struggle against bureaucracy, and resolutely fight against illegal and undisciplined behavior, corruption, theft, waste, coercion, and other behaviors, in order to maintain state discipline and improve the work of state organs at all levels.

The conference believes that, according to the above general requirements, supervisory organs at all levels must focus on inspecting three aspects in 1957. First, in order to comprehensively and overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan, and gradually improve the people's livelihood on the basis of developing production, the Party and the state require the earnest implementation of the policy of increasing production and practicing economy. Therefore, in 1957, state supervisory organs at all levels must first supervise the problems existing in the implementation of the policy of increasing production and practicing economy by state administrative organs, institutions, and enterprise management organs. The conference also put forward specific suggestions on how to supervise the problems existing in the implementation of the policy of increasing production and practicing economy in industry, transportation, agriculture, finance, and other aspects. The conference believes that in supervising this work, it is necessary to implement the spirit of building the country diligently and thriftily, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, and to establish a hard-working and simple style. Second, it is necessary to earnestly implement the state's policy of streamlining institutions and tightening staffing, focusing on inspecting the phenomena of oversized institutions, overlapping layers, and overstaffing in administrative and institutional organs at all levels. Through inspection, oppose formalism and bureaucratic style. Third, in order to guarantee the expansion of democratic life in state organs and further promote the enthusiasm of the people in supervising state administrative organs at all levels, it is necessary to strengthen the inspection and handling of citizens' complaints and appeals, strengthen the supervision of the handling of people's letters and visits by various organs, strengthen the leadership of people's supervisory correspondents, and oppose the suppression of criticism, retaliation, coercion, illegal and undisciplined behavior.

The conference believes that, in order to complete the tasks of the state supervisory organs in 1957 and improve the quality of supervisory work, supervisory organs at all levels must closely rely on the leadership of the Party and the government, strengthen investigation and research work, closely connect with the upper and lower levels and strengthen cooperation with relevant departments, and earnestly implement the Party's mass line. Supervisory cadres should strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and the Party's policies and guidelines, as well as necessary professional knowledge, continuously improve their work ability, and strive to do a good job in supervisory work.

The conference also discussed the organizational system of state supervisory organs.

During the conference, Vice Chairman Zhu De attended the meeting and gave instructions. Attendees also heard reports from Vice Premier of the State Council Li Xiannian, Bo Yibo, and Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan.

The conference was attended by a total of 222 people, including heads of supervision departments (bureaus) of various provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and national supervision bureaus.

    全国监察工作会议确定今年中心任务
    监督国家机关完成五年计划
    着重检查增产节约精简机构和民主生活等方面的问题
    新华社3日讯　监察部在去年12月21日到31日举行了第六次全国监察工作会议。
    会议总结了1956年的工作，并且确定了1957年国家监察机关的中心任务。这个中心任务是：根据中共第八次全国代表大会和八届二中全会的精神，加强监督各级国家行政机关、事业和企业管理机关及其工作人员全面地完成国家第一个五年计划，积极地为第二个五年计划作好准备工作。为此，各级国家监察机关和全体监察工作人员，必须切实遵照中共第八次全国代表大会政治报告中所指出的，应当在反对官僚主义斗争中，充分发挥应有的作用，并坚决地向违法乱纪、贪污盗窃、损失浪费、强迫命令等行为作斗争，以达到维护国家纪律、改进各级国家机关工作的目的。
    会议认为，根据上述总的要求，各级监察机关在1957年必须着重地检查三个方面的问题。第一，为了全面地超额完成第一个五年计划，并在发展生产的基础上逐步改善人民生活，党和国家要求认真地贯彻增产节约的政策。因此，各级国家监察机关在1957年首先要监督国家行政机关、事业和企业管理机关在执行增产节约政策中存在的问题。会议还就工业、交通运输业、农业、财政等方面如何监督在执行增产节约政策中所存在的问题，提出了具体意见。会议认为，在监督这项工作时，必须贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办好一切事业的精神，树立艰苦朴素的作风。第二，要认真执行国家精简机构、紧缩编制的方针，着重检查各级行政机关和事业机关的机构庞大、层次重叠、人浮于事的现象。通过检查，反对文牍主义和官僚主义的作风。第三，为了保证扩大国家机关中的民主生活，进一步发扬人民群众监督各级国家行政机关的积极性，必须加强对公民控告申诉的检查处理，加强对各机关处理人民来信来访工作的监督，加强对人民监察通讯员的领导，反对压制批评、打击报复和强迫命令、违法乱纪的行为。
    会议认为，为了完成1957年国家监察机关的任务，提高监察工作质量，各级监察机关要紧紧依靠党和政府的领导，加强调查研究工作，密切上下级的联系和加强与有关部门的协作，认真贯彻党的群众路线。监察干部要加强学习马克思列宁主义和党的政策方针以及必要的业务知识，不断提高工作能力，努力做好监察工作。
    会议还对国家监察机关的体制问题进行了讨论。
    会议期间，朱德副主席曾到会作了指示。到会人员还听了国务院副总理李先念、薄一波和农业部部长廖鲁言作的报告。
    参加会议的有各省、自治区、直辖市监察厅（局）和各国家监察局的负责人等共二百二十二人。
