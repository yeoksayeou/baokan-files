Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has instructed all units of the army to buy fewer New Year goods and meat around the Spring Festival, and to properly handle issues such as borrowing civilian houses.

The instruction stated that around the Spring Festival, the supply of New Year goods and non-staple foods (mainly meat) in urban and rural areas is tight. All officers and soldiers, especially officers, should buy fewer New Year goods and meat in order to satisfy the needs of the people as much as possible.

The instruction stated that for those homeowners whose families are living in cramped conditions or even living elsewhere because of the occupation of civilian houses, the troops should try to vacate some of the houses; if the homeowner's family is getting married, they should have a house for the newlyweds; the borrowing or renting of civilian houses by officers' families, whether in cities or villages, must be restricted and allowed only after approval; for civilian houses borrowed by the troops in the cities, rent must be paid in accordance with the regulations of the State Council and the General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army. Those who have not paid should conduct a cleanup around the Spring Festival and negotiate compensation with the local government. Officers and soldiers of all units should take good care of the borrowed civilian houses and borrowed furniture. If there is any damage, they will be responsible for repairs and compensation.

Regarding the issue of military sites, the instruction requires all units to conduct a check with the local government and return the land that is not necessary for occupation to the government. Shooting ranges that are inappropriately located should be moved immediately. All motor transport units should take effective measures to eliminate traffic accidents.

In its instructions, the General Political Department also requested that all units actively solicit opinions from local Party and government organs and the people, and dispatch cadres to inspect and solve problems quickly on the spot, and be sure to do a good job in supporting the government and cherishing the people.
