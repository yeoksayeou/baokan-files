    The First Year of Reclaiming Land in Nanhenglingzi
    --Visiting the 8502 State Farm
    By Our Reporter Lin Xi

    In mid-December 1956, I traveled by car from Mishan City, Heilongjiang Province, to Nanhenglingzi in the eastern part of Baoqing County – the location of the 8502 Farm headquarters.

    This grassland, once known as the Great Northern Wilderness, was covered in over a foot of snow, truly resembling a silver ocean. This farm only began construction in March 1956, and now it already has rows of houses, herds of horses and cattle, and supply and marketing cooperatives, hospitals, post offices, and bookstores have been established one after another. In this short period, how much arduous and intense labor have people put in!

    In March, the northern Manchurian prairie was covered in snow like it is now, but more frightening were the frequent gales that lasted for days. The snow whipped up by the wind made it impossible to tell which direction you were facing. In such weather, people risked being buried by snowdrifts, even freezing to death. During those days, Huang Zhenrong, the current Deputy Director of the 8502 Farm, and the three-person shock team he led, ventured into this wilderness to determine the location of the farm. This area originally had a military road built by the Japanese. After Japan surrendered in 1945, it became desolate, with the road merging with the grassland and forest. These comrades walked for seven days and seven nights in snow that was knee-deep, sleeping in the snow at night, eating dry rations, drinking snow water, and constantly threatened by wolves, bears, and other wild animals. Finally, they chose Nanhenglingzi as the location.

    It was close to the roadbed leading to Baoqing and Hulin, and with slight repairs, this land could be connected to the transportation lines. There were forests here, providing materials for building houses and fuel. More importantly, there were 90,000 to 100,000 hectares of black soil virgin land here, where people could reclaim, sow, settle down, and build a career.

    The first people who arrived built A-frame grass shacks to receive more people who would come here. Immediately afterward, they repaired 300 li of roads and built more than 200 bridges and culverts. This ensured that grain, building materials, and equipment could be transported in. The frost-free period in eastern Heilongjiang is only a little over 100 days, while the severe winter lasts for half a year. Therefore, building houses and plowing the land became the most urgent tasks before the ground froze.

    In May, the tractor team arrived at Nanhenglingzi. What a great encouragement this was to the people! Before the rainy season in September, the 8502 Farm plowed 21,000 hectares of land. Because the sowing season had passed, most of the land could not be sown in time, but many soldiers were attracted by this black, oily soil. They scattered soybean seeds (more than ten days past the sowing period) on 1,100 hectares of plowed land. As a result, each hectare of land yielded an average of more than 550 kilograms. They also planted 400 hectares of vegetables, harvesting more than 1,000 tons of cabbage and radishes alone. If it hadn't been for poor storage, there would have been enough vegetables to eat throughout the winter. A farm worker (a demobilized soldier) told me that they only started planting squash in mid-June, and everyone lacked confidence at the time, but in July, the squash grew unexpectedly large. He couldn't help but say, "This black soil is really fertile!"

    Here, the lowest winter temperature drops to over 40 degrees Celsius below zero, and the snow accumulates for half a year, making it a major issue to ensure that people have houses with insulation. To build houses, the farm specially established an infrastructure construction team. In just a few months, they built houses with a total area of more than 66,000 square meters, including staff dormitories, offices, clubs, etc., solving the housing problem for more than 6,000 people (including more than 600 with families). The construction of the houses was very difficult. From the beginning, they encountered a shortage of tools. But people used their ingenuity to overcome the difficulties. Team leader Lu Baoying used scrap iron to make various types of trowels; Youth League member Chen Wanlong once increased his daily quota of making 300 adobe bricks to more than 1,000. Generally speaking, the quality of these houses is not good enough. However, it is no easy task to build so many houses in such conditions and in such a short time.

    It started snowing here in October, and winter began. Most of the people who came here to reclaim land came from various southern provinces, and winter was a serious threat to them. But people were not conquered by winter. They continued to go up the mountains to fell trees and collect sand and gravel, continued to raise livestock, repair farm implements, and select seeds to prepare for this year's spring plowing and basic construction. According to the farm's winter production tasks, before the thaw in April this year, they must fell more than 14,700 cubic meters of timber, collect 8,500 cubic meters of crushed stone and gravel, and accumulate 2,500 tons of fertilizer, with a total labor input of more than 163,000 workdays. I asked Deputy Director Huang: Is this task guaranteed to be completed? His answer was: It will definitely be completed!

    People who love their careers and have great ideals for their careers live happily and vigorously in any difficult situation.

    南横岭子开荒的第一年
    ——访八五○二国营农场
    本报记者　林晰
    1956年12月中旬，我从黑龙江省密山城乘坐汽车出发，到达宝清县东部的南横岭子——八五○二农场场部的所在地。
    这里，曾经被人称为北大荒的草原，已经复盖着一尺多深的白雪，真像银色的海洋一般。这个农场是1956年3月才开始建场的，而现在已经有了一排排的房屋，有了成群的马匹和牛，供销合作社、医院、邮局、书店也相继建立起来了。在这短短的时间里，人们曾经付出了多少艰辛而紧张的劳动啊！
      3月，北满草原像现在一样积着白雪，更可怕的是还经常刮起一连几天的大风，被风扬起的雪沫使人辨认不出方向来。遇到这种天气，人们有被雪堆埋没，甚至有冻死的危险。在这样的日子里，现任八五○二农场的黄振荣副场长，和他所带领的三个人组成的测定场址的突击队走进了这块荒原。这一带原来有日本人修筑的军用公路，从1945年日本投降以后，这里就荒无人烟，公路和草原、树林连成了一片。这些同志就在膝盖深的雪地里步行了七天七夜，晚上在雪地里露宿，吃干粮，喝雪水，还经常受到狼群、狗熊等野兽的威胁。最后，他们终于选中了南横岭子这个地方。
    这里靠近通往宝清、虎林的公路路基，只要稍加修复就可以把这块土地同交通线联接起来。这里有树林，盖房用材和燃料可以得到解决。更重要的是这里有九万公顷到十万公顷的黑土处女地，人们可以在这块肥沃的土地上开垦、播种，安家立业。
    头一批来到这里的人，搭起了人字形的草窝工棚，用以接待更多的人到这里来。紧接着，他们修复了三百里长的公路，还修建了两百多座桥梁和涵洞。这样，就能保证粮食、建筑用具和器材运送进来。黑龙江东部地区的无霜期只有一百多天，而严寒的冬季却有半年的时间；因此在上冻之前，盖房和翻耕土地成了最紧迫的任务。
    5月间，拖拉机队开到了南横岭子。这给人们多大的鼓舞啊！9月雨季之前，八五○二农场翻耕了二万一千公顷土地。由于播种季节已过，大部分土地没有来得及播种，但是许多战士被这块黑油油的土地吸引住了，他们在一千一百公顷的翻耕地上撒下了大豆种籽（已过播种期十几天）。结果，每公顷土地平均收获了五百五十多公斤。他们还种了四百公顷的菜蔬，仅白菜、萝卜就收获了一千多吨。如果不是因为保管不好的话，冬季的蔬菜是完全够吃的。一位农工（复员的战士）对我说，他们在6月中才开始种菜瓜，当时大家都没有信心；但是在7月份，瓜长得出乎意料的大。他情不自禁地说：“这黑土地真肥呀！”
    这里，冬天的最低温度下降到摄氏零下四十多度，积雪半年不化，使人们都有保暖设备的房子住是一件顶大的事情。为了修建房屋，农场里专门成立了一个基建大队。他们在短短的几个月里，建造了总面积六万六千多平方公尺的房屋，包括职工宿舍、办公室、俱乐部等，解决了六千多人（其中有六百多人有家属）的住房问题。建造房屋的工程是十分艰巨的。一开始，就遇到了工具不足的困难。但人们发挥了自己的智慧来战胜了困难。中队长芦保英同志利用废铁皮制成了各种类型的瓦刀；青年团员陈万龙曾经把每天做土坯三百块的定额提高到一千多块。一般地说，这些房屋的质量是不够好的。但是，在这样的条件和短促的时间里修建出这样多数量的房屋，真不是一件容易的事。
    10月这里就下雪，冬季开始了。在这里开荒的人大部分都来自南方各省，冬季对他们来说真是一个严重的威胁。但是人们并没有被冬天征服。他们照样上山伐木、采砂石，照样饲养牲畜、修配农具和选种，为今年的春耕生产和基本建设作准备工作。按照农场的冬季生产任务，到今年4月解冻以前，要伐木一万四千七百多立方公尺，采集碎石、砂石八千五百立方公尺，积肥二千五百吨，总用工数达到十六万三千多个。我问过黄副场长：这个任务有把握完成吗？他的回答是：一定能完成！
    热爱自己的事业，对事业抱有远大理想的人，在任何困难的情况下，都是愉快地生气勃勃地生活着。
