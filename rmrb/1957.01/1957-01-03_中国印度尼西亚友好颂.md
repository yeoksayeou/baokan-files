The waters of the Huangpu River kiss the shores of Java,
The coconut breeze of Sulawesi caresses the ancient pines of the Kunlun Mountains.
The friendship between the people of China and Indonesia
Is as inseparable as the feelings of brothers.
We have jointly experienced centuries without sunshine,
And have struggled from darkness to dawn.
Today our spines are as straight as mountains,
Who can still regard us as "people to be ridden on"? [1]
We have lived in the East for generations,
We jointly embrace the Pacific Ocean,
We jointly embrace a belief:
"Pancasila" [2] will surely emit brilliant light!
Our two countries have different climates,
No one wants it to snow heavily on the equator.
Apples and durians each have excellent flavors,
Why force rambutan [3] to become lychee?
Wisdom must exchange with wisdom,
Chinese characters and Indonesian words shake hands warmly,
Balinese dance and Peking Opera are universal languages,
Songs of friendship spread throughout Asia!
Sumatran rubber will visit Shanghai,
Beijing silk will appear in Jakarta's pasar [4].
Airplanes and ships cross clouds and waves,
Tightly linking our hopes together.
Our hopes are tightly linked together,
Advancing bravely on the road of peace,
Joy rises from the bottom of our hearts,
The bugle of victory resounds throughout the heavens.

Note:
[1] Heine's poem "The World Upside Down" has the line "The horse rides on the back of the man."
[2] "Pancasila" is Indonesian for the Five Principles.
[3] Durian and rambutan are famous Indonesian fruits.
[4] "Pasar" is Indonesian for market.

    中国印度尼西亚友好颂
    何上何黄浦江的海水亲吻着爪哇海岸，苏拉威西的椰风抚摸着昆仑山上
  的苍松，中国—印度尼西亚人民的友谊，像兄弟的感情一样难解难分。我们共同经历过没有太阳的世纪，也曾经从黑夜搏斗到黎明；今天我们的脊梁像山一样挺直，谁还能够再把我们当作“马骑
  的人”。〔一〕我们世世代代生长在东方，我们共同拥抱着太平洋，我们共同拥抱着一个信念：“潘查希拉”〔二〕一定发出绚烂
  的光芒！我们两国有着不同的气候，谁也不想叫赤道上大雪纷飞，苹果、榴槤各有优良的风味，何必强求红毛丹〔三〕变成荔枝？智慧要和智慧交流，汉字和印尼文热情握手，峇厘舞、京剧就是通用的语言，友好的歌声传遍亚洲！苏门答腊的树胶要去访问上海，北京的丝绸在雅加达巴刹〔四〕
  露面；飞机、轮船越过云层、波浪，把我们的希望紧紧相连。我们的希望紧紧相连，在和平的大道上勇往直前，欢乐从我们的心底升起，胜利的号角响彻天边。
    注：〔一〕海涅诗篇“颠倒世界”有“马骑在人背上”的诗句。
    〔二〕“潘查希拉”为印度尼西亚语。即五项原则。
    〔三〕榴槤、红毛丹是印度尼西亚著名的水果。
    〔四〕“巴刹”为印度尼西亚语。即市场。
