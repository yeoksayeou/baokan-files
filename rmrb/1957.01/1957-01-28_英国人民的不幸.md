    The Misfortune of the British People
    The British people are constantly paying a heavy price for the war of aggression against Egypt launched by the Conservative government. According to reports, due to the cutting off of navigation on the Suez Canal, prices in Britain have generally risen again since the new year. The price of cereal for the British people's breakfast has risen by one penny per box, tea has risen by eight pence per pound, bus fares have risen by 20%, and even public telephone calls cost three more pence...
    But despite the suffering of the British people, some big bosses who should be held responsible for the war of aggression against Egypt are constantly profiting from it. The British government has agreed to raise steel prices by 6%, approved price increases for coal, oil and rent, and will also increase railway passenger fares.

    英国人民的不幸
    英国人民正不断地为保守党政府发动的侵埃战争付出重大的代价。据报载，由于苏伊士运河航运被切断，新年以来，英国物价又在普遍上涨。英国人民早餐吃的麦片每盒上涨一便士，茶叶每磅上涨八便士，公共汽车票价上涨了20％，甚至连打公共电话也要多付三个便士……。
    但是尽管英国人民受苦，而应当为侵埃战争负责的一些大老板们却从中不断取得利益。英国政府已同意钢铁涨价6％，批准煤、石油和房租加价，并且还要提高铁路旅客运费。
