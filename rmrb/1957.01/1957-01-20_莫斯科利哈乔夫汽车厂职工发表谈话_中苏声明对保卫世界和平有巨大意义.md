Moscow Dispatch from our newspaper, January 19th: The Soviet people heard the news of the publication of the Sino-Soviet Joint Statement on the radio last night, and this morning they saw the full text of the statement in the newspapers. This historically significant document has been unanimously supported by the Soviet people. This afternoon, workers and technicians from the Moscow Likhachev Automobile Plant, who had just finished their shift, spoke to reporters about their views on the statement.

    Novikov, a worker in the bus workshop, said: "We are excitedly welcoming this statement. The joint statement of our two governments is our strength. Not long ago, Britain, France, and Israel launched an aggression against Egypt, and this aggression failed miserably. Now the United States is advocating the so-called Eisenhower Doctrine, but China and the Soviet Union support Egypt and the independence-loving people of the Middle East countries. The Eisenhower Doctrine will also be defeated."

    Belkin, a foreman in the assembly workshop, said: "Not only I, but all the workers in the workshop, and all the Soviet people believe that this statement will play an outstanding role in the struggle to defend world peace. The statement expresses our great friendship and will further strengthen the unity between the socialist countries. The joint statement will force the imperialists to carefully consider their actions."

    Fatreev, a foreman who has worked at the factory for twenty-five years, said: "Our friendship is effective in consolidating world peace. Comrade Zhou Enlai's visit to the Soviet Union greatly dampened the imperialists' aggressive ambitions. China will become stronger in its construction. The strengthening of our friendship strengthens the socialist camp."

    Sabronov, a designer in the forging workshop, said: "China and the Soviet Union are brothers in a common cause and will be as united and close as flesh and blood brothers."

    莫斯科利哈乔夫汽车厂职工发表谈话
    中苏声明对保卫世界和平有巨大意义
    本报莫斯科19日专电　苏联人民昨晚就从广播中听到了中苏联合声明发表的消息，今早又从报纸上看到了这个声明的全文。这个具有历史意义的文件得到了苏联人民的一致拥护。今天下午，莫斯科利哈乔夫汽车工厂刚刚下班的工人和技术人员向记者谈了他们对这个声明的见解。
    公共汽车车间工人诺维科夫说：“我们兴奋地迎接了这个声明，我们两国政府的共同声明是我们的力量。不久以前，英法和以色列发动了对埃及的侵略，这个侵略悲惨地失败了。现在美国又在鼓吹什么艾森豪威尔主义，但是中国和苏联支持埃及和中东各国爱好独立的人民。艾森豪威尔主义也会遭到失败的。”
    装配车间工长贝尔金说：“不但我，而且全车间职工，全体苏联人民都认为这个声明将在保卫世界和平的斗争中发挥卓越的作用。声明表示了我们的伟大友谊，并将进一步加强各社会主义国家之间的团结。联合声明将迫使帝国主义好好考虑自己的行为。”
    在这个工厂工作了二十五年的工长法特里耶夫说：“我们的友谊对于巩固世界和平是有成效的。周恩来同志这次访问苏联大大打击了帝国主义的侵略野心。中国在建设中将更加强大起来。我们之间的友谊加强了社会主义的阵地。”
    锻工车间设计师萨布罗诺夫说：“中国和苏联是共同事业的兄弟，将和骨肉兄弟一样团结得更加紧密。”
