What Kind of Person is Macmillan

After British Prime Minister Eden was forced to step down due to the failure of the invasion of Egypt, Harold Macmillan, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, took his place.

Harold Macmillan was born in 1894 in Scotland to a typical British upper-class family. His grandfather was the founder of Macmillan Publishers, the largest printing company in Britain (which was sold to an American businessman in 1951), and his father was also a publisher. His mother was American. Macmillan himself is one of the major capitalists in Britain. Before holding government positions, he was the general manager of Macmillan Publishers and later served as a director of the company and the Automatic Composing Machine Company. Shortly after World War I, Macmillan found a path to climb to the top of British politics: he married Dorothy Cavendish, the daughter of the Duke of Devonshire.

In 1924, Macmillan was elected to Parliament and began to climb slowly but steadily in the Conservative Party and the political arena as a whole.

When Churchill formed his cabinet in 1940, Macmillan was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Supply. Two years later, he was transferred to the position of Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. When the Allied forces landed in Algeria, Britain established a new ministerial position, Minister Resident at Allied Headquarters in Northwest Africa, and Macmillan held this position. Later, he was appointed as the representative of the United Kingdom to the French Committee of National Liberation. In November 1944, he served as the acting chairman of the Allied Commission in Italy.

In 1945, Macmillan returned to Britain and served as Secretary of State for Air in the then "caretaker" government, but lost his seat in Parliament in the July election. He was re-elected as a Member of Parliament in the Bromley by-election in Kent in November of the same year.

When the Conservative Party returned to power in 1951, he was appointed Minister of Housing and Local Government. He was promoted to Minister of Defence during Churchill's tenure. After Eden succeeded as Prime Minister, he was transferred to the position of Foreign Secretary. At the end of 1955, the Eden cabinet was reorganized, and Macmillan was transferred to the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Macmillan has close ties with the American ruling group. During World War II, when Macmillan served as Minister Resident at Allied Headquarters in Northwest Africa, he became close friends with Eisenhower, so much so that his colleagues called them "Ike and Mac."

When Macmillan served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Eden cabinet, his relationship with U.S. Treasury Secretary Humphrey was also very close.

Macmillan has been a Conservative throughout his thirty-three years in politics and has been highly appreciated by Churchill. He once said, "I am a liberal Conservative." But the British Labour Party believes that "Macmillan is an extreme right-winger." Critics in the British newspapers believe that he represents "the right-wing, unprogressive, backward-looking elements within the Conservative Party."

When Macmillan served as Foreign Secretary in the Eden cabinet, he vigorously promoted the policy of "strength," advocated the "Cold War," and advocated the atomic arms race. He believed that "the basic principle or main purpose of British foreign policy" was to "deter" war by "possessing a deterrent force," to establish peace through "alliances," and to "influence people" through "the highest common cooperation."

During his thirteen months as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Macmillan tried his best to demand that the vast majority of the British people tighten their belts, endure "certain sacrifices and disappointments" of a reduced standard of living, and opposed the demands of British workers for higher wages. At the Conservative Party's annual meeting last October, when discussing economic issues, he reiterated the claim he had repeated more than once, that domestic consumption must be further reduced in order to expand exports and reduce the foreign trade deficit.

Macmillan is a person who once advocated "taking a tough line against Egypt." He firmly supported Eden's Near East policy. After the failure of the invasion of Egypt, he also tried his best to defend the British government's aggressive actions, saying that Britain's actions had prompted the United Nations to establish its first "International Emergency Force," and said that this "perhaps prevented the Third World War."

    麦克米伦是怎样一个人
    英国首相艾登先生由于侵埃战争失败而被迫下台后，原任财政大臣的哈罗德·麦克米伦接替了他的位置。
    哈罗德·麦克米伦1894年出生于苏格兰一个典型的英国大资产阶级家庭。他的祖父是英国最大的印刷厂——麦克米伦出版公司（该公司已于1951年出卖给美国商人）的创办人，父亲也是一个出版商，母亲是美国人。麦克米伦本人也是英国的大资本家之一。他在担任政府职务以前，曾经是麦克米伦出版公司的总经理，以后任该公司和自动排字机公司的董事。第一次世界大战后不久，麦克米伦找到了一条在英国爬上政治顶峰的道路——他和德文希尔公爵的女儿道罗赛·卡文迪什结了婚。
    1924年麦克米伦被选入议会，开始缓慢地但是稳步地在保守党和整个政界中往上爬。
    1940年丘吉尔组阁时，麦克米伦被任命为军需供应部政务次官，两年以后，调任殖民地部次官。当盟军在阿尔及利亚登陆时，英国设立了驻西北非盟军总部驻节部长的新的大臣级职位，麦克米伦担任了这个职务。后来，他被任命担任联合王国驻法国民族解放委员会的代表。1944年11月担任盟国在意大利的委员会的代理主席。
    1945年麦克米伦回到英国，在当时的“看守”政府中担任空军大臣，但在7月的大选中失去了他的议员席位。他在同年11月肯特郡布朗莱的补缺选举中再度当选为议员。
    1951年保守党重新当政时，他被任命为房屋与地方政府大臣。他在丘吉尔任内被提升为国防大臣；艾登继任首相后又调任外交大臣。1955年底艾登内阁改组，麦克米伦被调任为财政大臣。
    麦克米伦同美国统治集团有着亲密的关系。在第二次世界大战期间，麦克米伦担任驻西北非盟军总部驻节部长的时候他同艾森豪威尔就成了莫逆的朋友，以致他的同僚们把他们称为“艾克和麦克”。
    麦克米伦在艾登内阁中担任财政大臣的时候，同美国财政部长汉弗来的关系也一直是很密切的。
    麦克米伦在他三十三年的全部政治生活中一直是一个保守党人，并且深得丘吉尔的赏识。他曾说过“我是个自由主义的保守党人。”但英国的工党却认为“麦克米伦是个极端右派分子”。在英国的报纸上抨击他的人认为他代表“保守党内右派的、不进步的、向后看的分子”。
    麦克米伦在艾登内阁中担任外交大臣时，曾大肆宣传“实力”政策，鼓吹“冷战”，主张原子军备竞赛。他认为“英国外交政策的基本原则或主要目的”是通过“握有威慑力量”来“阻止”战争，通过“联盟”来建立和平，以及通过“最高的共同合作”来“影响人民”。
    在担任财政大臣的十三个月期间，麦克米伦竭力要求英国广大人民勒紧腰带，忍受降低生活水平的“某些牺牲和失望”，反对英国工人提高工资的要求。去年10月英国保守党年会讨论经济问题时，他又重复了已经重复过不止一次的主张，就是必须进一步减少国内消费，以利扩大出口和减少对外贸易的赤字。
    麦克米伦是一个曾经主张“对埃及采取强硬方针”的人，他坚决支持艾登的近东政策。在侵埃战争失败以后，他还竭力为英国政府的侵略行为辩解，说是英国的行动促使联合国建立起它的第一支“国际紧急部队”，还说这“也许就制止了第三次世界大战”。　（文煊）
