Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 6th: A recent issue of "U.S. News & World Report," published in late December, stated that the current debt of the American people totals $137 billion, an increase of $100 billion over the past decade. In other words, since the end of World War II, the people's debt has increased fivefold, while income has increased by less than onefold.
Among the 55 million American families, 1.1 million families must use 40% or more of their net income to repay installment debt alone; 5.5 million families must use 20% to 39% of their net income to repay debts.
The magazine also said that if other debts are included, then 6.1 million families must use 40% or more of their net income to repay debts; 14.3 million families must use 20% to 39% of their net income to repay debts.
The magazine stated that a few years ago, more than half of new car sales were made in cash, but in 1956, more than two-thirds were made in installments. The average debt for purchasing a new car has increased by 71% compared to 1950, and the average debt for purchasing a home has increased by 36% compared to 1950.
The magazine pointed out that installment payments have become an important weapon in the "fierce competitive battle" of American businessmen in marketing goods. American entrepreneurs and consumers are continuing to increase their debt step by step and cannot stop.
The magazine said that some economists have expressed concern that excessive debt may cause a slight decline in the U.S. economy in the future to turn into a real recession.
Xinhua News Agency, New York, 6th (TASS): According to the American labor newspaper "Labor Daily," preliminary data shows that a total of 3,800 strikes occurred in the United States in 1956, involving approximately 1.9 million workers. As a result of the strikes, the United States lost 33 million workdays, almost 5 million more workdays lost than in 1955.

    美国人民债务比战前增五倍
    去年罢工三千八百起　损失三千多万个劳动日
    新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：去年12月下旬出版的一期“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志说，美国人民目前的债务共计有一千三百七十亿美元，比十年前增加了一千亿美元，也就是自从第二次大战结束以来，人民的债务已经增加了五倍，而收入的增加却不到一倍。
    单是在分期付款的债务方面，在五千五百万个美国家庭中，有一百一十万个家庭必须用他们的净收入的40％或40％以上偿还债务；有五百五十万个家庭必须用他们的净收入的20％到39％偿还债务。
    杂志还说，如果把其他各种债务算在一起，那末，就有六百一十万个家庭必须把他们的净收入的40％或40％以上偿还债务；有一千四百三十万个家庭必须把他们的净收入的20％到39％偿还债务。
    杂志说，在几年以前，有二分之一以上的新汽车买卖是用现款成交的，1956年却有三分之二以上用分期付款成交。购买一辆新车时的平均欠债已经比1950年增加了71％，购买一所住宅时的平均欠债已经比1950年增加了36％。
    杂志指出，分期付款已经成为美国商人在推销商品的“激烈竞争搏斗”中的重要武器。美国企业家和消费者正在继续把债务一步步地增加而不能停止。
    杂志说，有些经济学家已经表示，他们担心过分重的债务将有可能使得美国经济今后发生轻微的下降时就会转变成真正的衰退。
    新华社6日讯　塔斯社纽约讯：据美国工会报纸“劳工日报”说，根据初步材料，1956年美国一共发生罢工三千八百起，参加罢工的约有一百九十万工人。罢工的结果使美国损失了三千三百万个劳动日，几乎比1955年多损失五百万个劳动日。
