Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 24th. Hubei Province achieved a great victory on the agricultural production front last year. The province's grain output increased by 2.2 billion jin compared to 1955, cotton increased by more than 1 million dan (lint), pigs increased by more than 1 million heads, cattle increased by 200,000 heads, and other cash crops and sideline production also had significant growth. Among the province's advanced agricultural cooperatives, those with increased production (compared to 1955) accounted for 92.25%; 84% of the elementary cooperatives also increased production. This was stated by Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, at a meeting of prefectural committee secretaries held on the 13th of this month. At the meeting, Wang Renzhong summarized the achievements and basic experience of Hubei Province's agricultural production and cooperation work last year, and put forward the guiding principles and tasks for future rural work.

Wang Renzhong said: During the autumn harvest distribution period last year, a survey of more than 1.7 million cooperative member households in the province showed that 84.22% of the households had increased their income compared to the previous year. Due to the efforts in winter production, it is expected that by the Spring Festival, the province will reach 95% of agricultural cooperatives with increased production, and the number of cooperative member families with increased income compared to the previous year may reach about 90%. Wang Renzhong said: This fully demonstrates the great superiority of agricultural cooperation. Xiaogan County's total grain output last year increased by 42% compared to the previous year, and the province's total cotton output increased by 37% compared to the previous year, which shows that the potential for agricultural production increase is enormous.

As for the main sign of whether agricultural cooperatives are consolidated, he continued: It depends on whether production can be increased and whether the vast majority of cooperative members can increase their income. Since the bumper harvest last autumn, farmers in Hubei Province have unanimously praised agricultural cooperatives, and the vast countryside is full of a joyful atmosphere. So far, no cooperative has collapsed in Hubei Province, and in some places, individual cooperative members have asked to withdraw from the cooperative. We believe that within a few years, it is not surprising that a small number of people come and go in agricultural cooperatives. However, it must be seen that when we say that agricultural cooperatives are well-run and consolidated, we only mean that they are basically well-run and basically consolidated, and we cannot think that they have been run very well or are very consolidated. Because, at present, there are still many problems in the operation and management of cooperatives, especially there are some backward cooperatives everywhere, and even in advanced cooperatives, there are still backward production teams. In the upsurge of cooperation and the movement of merging cooperatives and upgrading, some townships and villages with backward work were driven to cooperate together, so the consciousness of some of the masses is not high, the leading backbone is not strong, and the work is more difficult. These are problems in the process of advancement, and if we work very well, are not arrogant and complacent, and are not paralyzed and careless, we will be able to solve these problems gradually and smoothly.

Wang Renzhong said: In the future, the rural work of Hubei Province will mainly be to further consolidate agricultural cooperatives politically, economically, and organizationally, and strive for a greater bumper harvest in agricultural production. The specific task put forward by the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is to thoroughly consolidate the province's agricultural cooperatives within three years, starting from the first year of cooperation – 1956. Within three years, it is required that the total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations of more than 80% of the province's agricultural cooperatives increase by more than 50% compared to 1955; so that the majority of cooperative members can reach the living standards of well-to-do middle peasants (i.e., enough to eat, dress, and use with surplus), and households with a lack of labor and large families can generally also achieve enough to eat, dress, and have money to spend, and get rid of poverty. Among them, strive for more than 10% of the province's advanced agricultural cooperatives to increase the total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations by more than one time within three years.

Finally, Wang Renzhong pointed out: In the past year, Hubei Province has gained the following basic experiences in rural work:

Correctly implementing the Party's class line in the countryside is an important factor in the victory of agricultural cooperation.

First, the cooperation movement in Hubei Province has developed a lot, quickly, and well, mainly because it has correctly implemented the Party's class line in the countryside. From development to consolidation, we have always adhered to the policy of relying on poor peasants (including new and old lower-middle peasants) and uniting with middle peasants. In rural party rectification, training agricultural cooperative cadres, establishing agricultural cooperative preparatory committees, formally establishing cooperative management committees, and subsequent rectification work, we paid attention to establishing the leading advantage of poor peasants in agricultural cooperatives, and at the same time paid attention to the policy of uniting with middle peasants. In the specific implementation of policies, various places have also found some problems: one is that they only emphasized establishing the advantage of poor peasants, and did not do enough to unite with middle peasants; one is that they only emphasized uniting with middle peasants, and did not establish the advantage of poor peasants, forming a situation in these cooperatives where middle peasants are in power, discriminating against and excluding poor peasant cooperative members. These two situations require that in future consolidation work, through mobilizing the masses and strengthening the leadership of backward cooperatives, they should be properly handled according to two different situations. After cooperation, a view circulated among some people: that the class line is needed when organizing agricultural cooperatives, and there is no need to emphasize the class line after cooperation. Experience has proved that this view is wrong. The Party's class line in the countryside is not only applicable in organizing agricultural cooperatives, but also needs to be correctly implemented during the period of consolidating cooperatives in the future. Only by establishing the leading advantage of poor peasants and correctly implementing the policy of treating middle peasants can we consolidate and unite middle peasants.

The scale of agricultural cooperatives should not be too large, and the organization of agricultural cooperatives should not be changed frequently.

Second, two rounds of merging cooperatives and upgrading work were carried out in the spring and autumn of last year, and the province achieved advanced forms of agricultural cooperation. Over the past year, we have paid attention to two points: one is that the scale of agricultural cooperatives should not be too large (generally around 100 households, and large ones around 300 households), and the other is that the organization of agricultural cooperatives should not be changed frequently. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that in the next few years, the organization of cooperatives will generally no longer change, and agricultural cooperatives will be stabilized on the existing basis. In the future, the task of rural leadership is to resolutely strengthen the leadership of townships and cooperatives, encourage rural cadres to closely contact the masses and share weal and woe with the masses, and stipulate that township and cooperative cadres should spend more time directly participating in production and leading production.

The widespread formulation of production plans played a positive role in promoting production and inspiring people.

Third, last year, rural areas in various places generally formulated production plans, which played a positive role in promoting production and inspiring people. The shortcomings of past planning work are: inaccuracy and incompleteness. Inaccurate planning is subjectivism; incomplete planning is one-sidedness. Future planning work requires accuracy and comprehensiveness, not only with various production increase targets, but also with practical and feasible measures. In short, in the formulation of production plans, it is necessary to grasp the principles of adapting to local conditions, adapting to the times, and acting according to one's ability. In addition to doing a good job in the specific plans for 1957, the Provincial Party Committee believes that it is also necessary for various places and cooperatives to put forward a long-term plan for developing production in accordance with local conditions, so that the masses can see the long-term struggle goals, see the beautiful prospects, and thus mobilize the masses, inspire the masses, and be full of confidence in building a new socialist countryside.

The five reforms of agricultural technology were promoted.

Fourth, Hubei Province put forward five reforms of agricultural technology last year, most of which were successful, but there were also lessons of failure. The province will continue to promote these five reforms in the future, only revising the item of "changing indica rice to japonica rice" to "changing to improved varieties." However, this is only a call for the whole province, and various places and agricultural cooperatives should have their own formulations, and formulate measures to increase production that are suitable for the local area. In the future, it is necessary to further draw a clear line for many technical measures (such as close planting, early sowing, etc.), and not blindly and recklessly engage in them. In particular, it is necessary to remind everyone: the things that failed in 1956 may not be repeated this year, but conversely, the things that succeeded in 1956 (such as double-cropping rice and single-season late japonica rice) should be more vigilant this year to prevent blind promotion due to success. In the future, there should still be leadership, planning, movement, and calls in production, but do not mechanically assign tasks to townships and cooperatives, do not mechanically limit time, and let cooperatives have the right to act in accordance with the leadership's intentions and based on local conditions and the opinions of the masses.

Establishing advanced models and implementing a production reward system promoted production.

Fifth, establish advanced models and implement a production reward system. Hubei Province last year put forward the call for "thousand-jin grain cooperatives" (grain yield of 1,000 jin per mu) and "hundred-jin cotton cooperatives" (cotton yield of 100 jin of lint per mu), creating banners of large-area, high-yield, and abundant production. This typical demonstration approach has achieved good results in promoting overall production. According to recent statistics, 1,900 "thousand-jin grain cooperatives" and 712 "hundred-jin cotton cooperatives" appeared in the province last year. These advanced high-yield units will be rewarded by the province and county respectively. This year, the province proposes that the number of "thousand-jin grain cooperatives" reach 3,000, the number of "hundred-jin cotton cooperatives" reach 1,500, and the diversified operations of agricultural cooperatives in mountainous areas and the development of pig raising in various places can also put forward different high-yield indicators and establish advanced models. This is the best way to promote technological reforms. This will drive the vast number of agricultural cooperatives and farmers to move forward more actively and vigorously.

    湖北省去年农业生产取得很大胜利
    广大农村充满欢乐气氛，农民同声称赞农业社
    王任重同志谈一年来湖北农村工作的估价和基本经验
    新华社武汉24日电　湖北省去年在农业生产战线上取得很大的胜利。全省粮食比1955年增加了二十二亿斤，棉花增加了一百多万担（皮棉），猪增加了一百多万头，牛增加了二十万头，其他经济作物和副业生产也都有显著的增长。全省的高级农业社中，增产社（与1955年比较）占92.25％；初级社也有84％的社增加了生产。这是中共湖北省委员会第一书记王任重在本月13日举行的地委书记联席会议上说的。会上，王任重对去年湖北省农业生产和合作化工作的成绩和基本经验做了总结，并提出了今后农村工作的方针任务。
    王任重说：在去年秋收分配期间，全省曾调查了一百七十多万户社员家庭，其中有84.22％的户比前年增加了收入。由于冬季生产的努力，预计到春节时全省可以达到95％的农业社增产，比前年增加收入的社员家庭可能达到90％左右。王任重说：这就充分证明了农业合作化的巨大优越性。孝感县去年粮食总产量比前年增加了42％，全省棉花总产量比前年增加了37％，可见农业增产的潜力是巨大的。
    至于农业社是否巩固的主要标志，他接着说：就看能不能增加生产，绝大多数社员能不能增加收入。自从去年秋季丰收以来，湖北省农民异口同声称赞农业社，广大农村充满着欢乐的气氛。至今在湖北省还没有发现垮过一个社，有些地方曾经出现个别社员要求退社的。我们认为，在几年内，农业社里有少数人出出进进，这种情况不足为怪。但是，必须看到，我们说农业社办得好，农业社是巩固的，只是说基本上办得好，基本上是巩固的，不能认为已经办的十分好了，也还不是十分巩固的。因为，目前在合作社的经营管理方面，还存在着不少的问题，特别各地都有一些落后社，即使在先进社当中，也还有落后生产队。在合作化高潮和并社升级运动中，把一些工作落后的乡、村带动一齐合作化了，因而部分群众的觉悟不高，领导骨干不强，工作困难较多。这些都是前进中的问题，如果我们工作得很好，不骄傲自满，不麻痹大意，就能够逐步地顺利地解决这些问题。
    王任重说：今后湖北省的农村工作，主要是从政治上、经济上和组织上进一步巩固农业社，争取农业生产更大的丰收。中共湖北省委员会提出的具体任务是，从合作化的第一年——1956年起，三年以内，使全省的农业社彻底巩固起来。三年内要求全省80％以上的农业社农副业总产值比1955年增加50％以上；使多数的社员都能够达到富裕中农的生活水平（即够吃够穿够用而有余），缺乏劳动力和家大口阔的困难户，一般也能达到有吃有穿有钱用，摆脱贫困。其中，争取全省有10％以上的先进农业社，在三年以内农副业总产值增加一倍以上。
    最后，王任重指出：一年来湖北省在农村工作方面取得了以下一些基本经验：
    正确地贯彻了党在农村中的阶级路线是农业合作化获得
    胜利的重要因素
    一、湖北省合作化运动发展很多、很快、又很好，主要是正确地贯彻了党在农村中的阶级路线。从发展到巩固的过程中，始终坚持执行了依靠贫农（包括新老下中农）、团结中农的政策。在农村整党、训练农业社骨干、建立农业社筹备委员会、正式建立社务管理委员会以及后来的历次整社工作中，都注意了树立贫农在农业社里的领导优势，同时注意了团结中农的政策。各地在具体执行政策中也发现了一些问题：一种是只强调了树立贫农优势，对中农的团结不够；一种是只强调了团结中农，没有树立起贫农的优势，在这些社里形成中农当权，歧视和排斥贫农社员。这两种情况，要求在今后巩固工作中，通过发动群众，加强对落后社的领导，分别两种不同情况加以妥善处理。合作化以后，曾在部分人中间流传着一种论调：认为组织农业社时要阶级路线，合作化以后就不需再强调阶级路线了。经验证明，这种论调是错误的。党在农村的阶级路线，不仅是在组织农业社中适用，而且在今后巩固社的期间同样需要正确地加以贯彻。只有树立起贫农的领导优势，又正确执行对待中农的政策，才能巩固地团结中农。
    农业社的规模不宜太大，农业社的组织不宜多变
    二、去年春、秋两季进行了两次并社升级工作，全省实现了高级形式的农业合作化。一年来，我们注意了两点：一是农业社的规模不宜太大（一般在一百户左右，大的三百户左右），二是农业社的组织不宜多变。中共湖北省委员会认为在今后若干年内，社的组织一般不再变动，在现有的基础上使农业社稳定下来。今后农村领导的任务，就是要坚决地加强乡、加强社的领导，鼓励农村干部密切联系群众，与群众同甘共苦，并且规定乡、社干部多抽一些时间直接参加生产，领导生产。
    普遍制定生产规划，对推动生产、鼓舞人心起了积极作用
    三、去年，各地农村普遍制定了生产规划，曾经对推动生产、鼓舞人心起了积极作用。过去规划工作的缺点是：不准确、不全面。规划不准确，就是主观主义；规划不全面，就是片面观点。今后的规划工作，要求准确一些，全面一些，不仅有各项增产指标，也要有切实可行的措施。总之在制定生产规划中，要掌握因地制宜因时制宜和量力而行的原则。各地除了做好1957年的具体规划以外，省委认为各地、各社因地制宜提出一个长期的发展生产的规划也是必要的，能够使群众看到长期奋斗目标，看到美好的远景，从而动员群众，鼓舞群众，充满信心建设社会主义的新农村。
    推行了农业技术的五项改革
    四、湖北省去年提出了农业技术的五项改革，这些改革大部分都是成功的，但也有失败的教训。全省今后仍然要继续推行这五项改革，只是把其中“改籼稻为粳稻”一项修正为“改换良种”。但是，这只是作为全省的号召，各地、各农业社应有自己的提法，因地制宜拟订适合当地的增产措施。今后对许多技术措施（如密植、提早播种等），要进一步划清界限，不能盲目蛮干。特别需要提醒大家：1956年失败了的东西，今年可能不会再犯这个错误，相反在1956年成功了的东西（如双季稻和一季晚粳稻），今年就要多加警惕，防止因为成功而盲目推广。今后在生产中仍然要有领导、有计划、有运动、有号召，只是不要向乡、社机械分派任务，不要机械限制时间，让合作社有权按照领导意图和根据当地条件以及群众的意见来办事。
    树立先进榜样，实行生产奖励制度，推动了生产
    五、树立先进榜样，实行生产奖励制度。湖北省去年曾提出“粮食千斤社”（粮食每亩产一千斤）、“棉花百斤社”（棉花每亩产一百斤皮棉）的号召，创造大面积高额丰产的旗帜。这种典型示范的作法，在推动全面生产当中收到了良好的效果。据最近的统计，全省去年出现了一千九百个“粮食千斤社”和七百一十二个“棉花百斤社”。对于这些先进的丰产单位，将分别由省和县给予奖励。今年，全省提出粮食“千斤社”达到三千个，棉花“百斤社”达到一千五百个，山区的农业社的多种经营和各地发展养猪，也可以分别提出不同的丰产指标，树立先进的榜样。这是推行技术改革最好的办法。这样就能带动广大农业社和农民群众更加积极、奋发地前进。
