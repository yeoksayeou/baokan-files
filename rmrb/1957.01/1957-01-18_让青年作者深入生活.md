    Let Young Authors Delve Deeply into Life
    Xin Sheng
    Since the dissolution of the creation groups in various regions, the situation of these young authors has been a matter of concern. According to a recent survey conducted by the Creative Committee of the National Dramatists Association among playwrights in fourteen provinces and cities, with the exception of a few authors who have immersed themselves in life, most authors have been transferred to local literary journals or publishing houses as editors, or are engaged in amateur literary creation guidance work; some have also been assigned to cultural administrative departments. Among these comrades, some were not very suitable for creative work, and now that they have switched to work that is closer to their interests and commensurate with their abilities, they will naturally be competent and happy. Others, although they have creative talents, are now participating in editorial work for a period of time, which is not entirely unhelpful for their future creations. However, if most young authors are kept away from the fiery struggle of life for a long time, this is certainly not the original intention of dissolving the creation groups.
    Recently, many new literary journals have been established in various regions, requiring a large number of editorial staff. It is also relatively easy for literary authors to become literary editors. Moreover, working as an editor for a period of time can be helpful for creation. Editors have to deal with other people's manuscripts, evaluate and study submissions, and offer concrete opinions to authors. In this way, they can absorb a lot of creative experience and improve their level of literary theory, which is of great benefit to their future creations. However, editorial work has significant limitations for young authors in understanding real life. Generally speaking, it is possible to write short articles in addition to editing work, but long-form creative works require more time and more concentrated energy. If editorial work provides many convenient conditions for studying creation and exploring literary theories, and is suitable for cultivating theoretical and critical workers, then it does have certain limitations on the development of creators. However, the increasing number of literary journals and the growing literary publishing industry today are all exciting phenomena. But with these good conditions, we must demand more and better works to meet the needs, and more works require more authors, but new writers are pulled into the editorial department halfway before they can grow up. "Robbing Peter to pay Paul" is not a good solution after all.
    In the high tide of socialist transformation, amateur literary activities in various regions have greatly developed, and amateur literary creation has also greatly flourished. After the dissolution of the creation groups, some young authors were transferred here to do guidance work, which was originally a good thing. "Teaching benefits both the teacher and the taught." Helping others create also improves oneself. At the same time, these people being guided are mostly workers and peasants, and familiarizing oneself with them is also beneficial. However, in practice, there will still be contradictions. Similar to the comrades who do editorial work, they often spend more time studying other people's creations and less time doing their own creative work, reading manuscripts, revising manuscripts, giving opinions, organizing seminars, establishing literary groups... These things have become their daily routine. These comrades don't have much "capital" to begin with, and now they have to help others, which is naturally very stressful. In this way, they feel overwhelmed by their "official" duties, and naturally have no time for amateur creative work. Over time, their creative work will gradually be abandoned. Some comrades said with distress: "We are being guided ourselves, and now we are asked to guide others. What will happen to us if we continue like this? Won't we all become half-baked!..." Guiding mass creation and developing mass literary activities is originally a specialized field of knowledge that requires a group of professional cadres. It is probably difficult to achieve both goals of cultivating young authors through guidance work. Naturally, the vast number of amateur authors are the foundation of the professional author team, and in the future, talents will be continuously transferred from mass amateur authors to the professional author team. However, we cannot focus on one thing and lose sight of the other, abandoning the young authors who already have some creative experience and have undergone some learning, and instead pinning all our strength and all our hopes on amateur authors. In this way, we may soon feel that there is a lack of creative talents, and that the level of creative work cannot meet the objective needs, and thus will be met with dissatisfaction and criticism from the masses. The "Drama" monthly magazine attaches great importance to the cultivation of young authors. Recently, although the number of submissions to the magazine has increased every month, the level of general works has improved very slowly, because more than 95% of the submissions are amateur authors' exercises. Many authors have not published any new works after publishing a script in the magazine. These situations should attract our attention.
    As for the authors who have been transferred to cultural administrative positions, their distress is also understandable. There, they not only lack the conditions for learning and writing, but also lack opportunities to delve into life. In the past, when they were in the creation groups, although their experience of life was not deep enough, they always had time to go down every year, but now, they are either in the office or in the dormitory, their living range is narrower, and they are more alienated from the sharp struggles. Someone said: "If the former creation group was like raising goldfish in a glass tank, then now it is like pouring them from a glass tank into an earthenware pot. Naturally, you cannot see life deeply through a glass tank, and you cannot see even a little bit of life through an earthenware pot..."
    Indeed, the organizational form of the creation group in the past had its shortcomings. It lacked organic connections with the overall society and was prone to alienation from the current struggles of life. Everyone expressed agreement with and support for the decision to abolish the creation groups. However, abolishing the creation groups does not mean abolishing creation, nor does it mean weakening the leadership over creation. The attitude of the central cultural authorities has always been very clear on this point. At the Cultural Bureau Chiefs Conference held by the Ministry of Culture in 1955, it was repeatedly emphasized that local cultural bureaus must attach importance to creation and strengthen their leadership over creation. At the Literary and Art Directors Conference held by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China last year, it was also requested that after the abolition of the creation groups, appropriate and specific arrangements should be made for the personnel of the creation groups, so that people with real creative abilities can better contact life and continue to write. Last June, the State Council approved the measures proposed by the Chinese Writers Association regarding creative leave for amateur writers. These measures not only solved the difficulties for the members of the Writers Association, but also provided great convenience and assistance to the vast number of young amateur authors. Unfortunately, not all local cultural administrative departments can fully appreciate this spirit of caring for authors and attaching importance to creation. They did not understand the decision to abolish the creation groups from the perspective of actively developing creation and cultivating young writers, but believed that it was simply a matter of disbanding them. In this way, they naturally rarely considered what effective measures should be taken to lead creation after the dissolution of the creation groups, and how these young authors should be properly arranged and further assisted.
    The paths of growth for writers are different, and each writer has their own unique creative journey. Cultivating writers and producing works cannot be done using a fixed method. However, among the differences, there is one thing in common: the works of many successful writers have proven that writers must be familiar with the content of the life they describe and must have a deep understanding of it. Especially for us young authors who lack life experience, we should go to the tides of life in the great era to hone ourselves. We should sympathize with and support the demands of these young authors: let them delve deeply into life, go to the sharp struggles, and not let their youthful vitality wither in quiet offices.

    让青年作者深入生活
    辛生
    自从各地创作组撤消以后，这些青年作者的情况是很令人关心的。从最近全国戏剧家协会创作委员会向十四个省市的剧作者调查的结果看来，除了个别作者深入了生活，大部分作者是调到当地文艺刊物或出版社里作了编辑，或者担任业余文艺创作的辅导工作，也有分配到文化行政部门去的。这些同志中间，有的原不太适合于搞创作，而今改作他们兴趣相近，能力相当的工作，自然会胜任愉快。有的虽有创作才能，而今参加一个时期的编辑工作，也不是对他们今后的创作全无帮助。但是，如果让大部分青年作者长期与火热的斗争生活隔离，这自然不是当初撤消创作组的原意。
    最近，各地新办的文艺刊物很多，需要很多的编辑工作人员，文艺作者改作文艺编辑也比较容易；而且，作一个时期的编辑工作，对创作也不能说没有帮助。编辑要处理别人的稿子，要对来稿进行品评、研究，要对作者提出具体的意见，这样，可以吸取不少创作的经验，可以提高文艺理论水平，这对于自己今后创作都有很大的好处。但是，编辑工作对于青年作者了解现实生活，究竟是有很大限制的。而且一般地说，编辑之余写些短文还是可能的，长篇创作的确需要更多一些的时间和更集中一些的精力。如果说编辑工作对研究创作、探讨文艺理论提供了不少便利的条件，适宜于培养理论批评工作者，那末，它对创作者的发展的确有一定的局限性。可是，今天各地文艺刊物日渐增多，文艺出版事业一天天发展，这都是令人兴奋的现象。但有了这些好条件，就不能不要求有更多更好的作品才能适应需要，更多的作品又得要求有更多的作者，而新作家不等成长起来就在半路上拉到编辑部里去了。“拆了东墙补西墙”，到底还不是个好办法。
    在社会主义改造的高潮中，各地业余文艺活动大大开展，业余文艺创作也大大活跃起来。创作组撤消以后，有些青年作者调到这里做了辅导工作，这本来也是好的。“教学相长”，在帮助别人创作中也提高了自己。同时，这些被辅导者多半是工农群众，熟悉他们，也是有好处的。但是，实际做起来，也仍然会有矛盾。和作编辑工作的同志相仿，他们经常也是研究别人的创作多，自己进行创作的时间少，看稿子，改稿子，提意见，组织座谈会，建立文艺小组……这些事就成了日常业务。这些同志的“本钱”就不多，现在要去帮助别人，自然就很紧张。这样，务“正业”尚感力不胜任，业余创作自然无暇顾及，久而久之，创作就会渐渐荒废了。有的同志苦闷地说：“我们正在被辅导，现在又叫我们去辅导人。我们这样下去怎么办呢？不是都弄成了些夹生饭！……”辅导群众创作，开展群众文艺活动，这原是一门专门的学问，需要一批专业的干部，想从辅导工作中来培养青年作者，恐怕是难得两全其美。自然，广大的业余作者是专业作者队伍的基础，今后将从群众业余作者中不断给专业作者的队伍输送人才。但是，也不能顾此失彼，舍近求远，把现在已经有些创作经验，已经经过一些学习的青年作者舍弃不顾，却把全部力量，全部希望，都寄托在业余作者身上。这样，我们将可能很快就感到创作人才的青黄不接，创作水平不能适应客观的需要，因而将遭到群众的不满和批评。“剧本”月刊是较重视青年作者的培养的，近来该刊在来稿的数量上虽然每月都有增加，但一般作品的水平却提高得很慢，因为来稿中95％以上是业余作者的习作，好多作者在刊物上发表了一个剧本以后，就再也没有新作发表了。过去一些常写稿，也有相当水平的青年作者来稿很少，这些情况是应该引起我们注意的。
    至于调到文化行政工作岗位上去的作者，他们的苦闷也是可以理解的。在那里不但缺少学习和写作的条件，更少深入生活的机会。过去在创作组时，体验生活虽然不够深入，但每年总有下去的时间，而现在，除了办公室就是宿舍，生活范围更狭窄了，跟尖锐的斗争更游离了。有人说：“如果说从前的创作组是玻璃缸里养金鱼，那么，现在是从玻璃缸倒入瓦罐里了。隔着玻璃缸看生活自然不能深刻，隔着瓦罐就连这一点生活也看不见了……”
    过去创作组这样的组织形式的确是有缺憾的，它与社会的整体缺乏有机的联系，容易与当前的斗争生活游离。对于取消创作组的决定，大家是表示同意和拥护的。但是，取消创作组并不等于取消创作，并不意味着减弱对创作的领导。这一点中央文化主管部门的态度始终是很明确的。中央文化部在1955年召开的文化局长会议上，曾一再强调指出各地文化局必须重视创作，加强对创作的领导。中共中央宣传部在去年召开的文艺处长会议上，也曾要求各地在取消创作组以后，应该对创作组人员作适当的具体安排，使真正有创作能力的人可以更好地接触生活而又能继续写作。去年6月国务院同意中国作家协会提出的关于业余作家创作假期的办法，这一办法不仅给作家协会的会员解决了困难，也给广大青年业余作者以很大的便利和帮助。可惜这样爱护作者、重视创作的精神并不是所有地方文化主管部门都能充分体会的，他们对取消创作组的决定没有从积极发展创作、培养青年作家的意义上去了解，认为仅仅是简单地解散了事。这样，对创作组撤消以后，应该采取一些什么有效的措施来领导创作，对这些青年作者应该如何适当的安排和进一步的帮助，自然就很少考虑到了。
    作家们成长的道路是各不一样的，各个作家都有他们各不相同的创作历程。培养作家、产生作品也决不能采取一个固定的方法。但是，在不同之中，有一点是共同的：许多成功作家的作品都证明，作家对自己所描写的生活内容必须熟知，必须有深刻的体会，尤其是我们这些缺少生活经验的青年作者，更应该到大时代的生活浪潮中去锻炼。我们应该同情和支持这些青年作者们的要求：让他们深入生活，到尖锐的斗争中去，不要让他们青春的活力在寂静的办公室里萎缩了。
