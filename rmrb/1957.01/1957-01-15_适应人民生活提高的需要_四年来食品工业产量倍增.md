Xinhua News Agency, January 14th. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Zhiqing reports): In the four years from 1953 to 1956, the output of China's food industry experienced tremendous growth. By 1956, the annual output of major food industries such as sugar, canned goods, and dairy products had increased by one to two times compared to 1952.

In the past four years, 92 sugar factories have been newly built or expanded across the country, including nine large-scale sugar factories above the quota. Including sugar factories below the quota, the country has increased sugar production capacity by a total of 250,000 tons. The nation's annual sugar output in 1956 increased by nearly one time compared to 1952, of which machine-made sugar accounted for 71%.

In the past four years, dozens of dairy product factories have been newly built or renovated in major milk-producing areas such as Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang. By now, there are 83 various dairy product factories nationwide, with an annual output more than doubling compared to 1952. The newly built large-scale milk powder factories are designed according to the latest standards, and the entire production process is automated and mechanized.

Before liberation, China only had a few small canning factories. After expansion and renovation in the past four years, there are now 26 canning factories nationwide, with an annual output more than doubling compared to 1952. The variety of canned goods has also greatly increased. Before 1953, most were meat and fruit canned goods with very few varieties. In recent years, more than 70 new canned goods such as various vegetables and fruits have been successfully trial-produced. These new canned goods have been welcomed by consumers at home and abroad.

In the past four years, dozens of oil factories have been newly built or expanded. Due to the increase in equipment, the national output of edible vegetable oil in 1956 increased by 21% compared to 1952. Among the newly built oil factories, there are large-scale oil and fat chemical plants with a daily processing capacity of more than 200 tons of raw materials, which can comprehensively utilize waste materials and by-products to produce products such as soap and furfural.

The output of cigarettes and alcohol in China has also grown rapidly. The national output of cigarettes in 1956 increased by more than 45% compared to 1952, and the output of alcohol increased by more than two times compared to 1952; among them, the proportion of fruit wine and medicinal wine has greatly increased. The state has also allocated special funds to expand and add equipment to factories producing world-famous wines such as Xinghuacun Fenjiu in Shanxi and Moutai in Guizhou, maintaining the excellent characteristics of these famous wines.

In addition, more than 100 new products such as candy, cold drinks, bread, and biscuits have been added in the past four years. Famous products such as Jinhua ham, Nanjing salted duck, Zhenjiang and Shanxi mature vinegar have not only increased in output but also maintained their original flavor.

The tremendous development of China's food industry in just four years is mainly the result of the rapid development of the country's industry and agriculture. At present, the production potential of the food industry is still very large, and if raw materials are sufficient, it can produce more and better food.

    Sugar——1956 output increased nearly one time compared to 1952; 92
          sugar factories were newly built or expanded nationwide, increasing
          sugar production capacity by 250,000 tons. Dairy products——Annual
          output increased more than one time; dozens of dairy product
          factories were newly built and renovated.
    Canned goods——Annual output increased more than two times; the
            number of canning factories increased from a few small factories to 26.
            Edible vegetable oil——Annual output increased by 21%; dozens
            of oil factories were newly built and expanded.
    Cigarettes and alcohol——Cigarette output increased by more than 45%;
            alcohol output increased more than two times.

    适应人民生活提高的需要
    四年来食品工业产量倍增
    新华社14日讯　新华社记者张志清报道：在1953年到1956年的四年里，我国食品工业的产量有了巨大增长。到1956年，全国食糖、罐头、乳制品等主要食品工业的年产量，都比1952年增长了一倍到两倍。
    四年来，全国新建扩建了九十二个糖厂，其中限额以上的大型糖厂有九个，连同限额以下的糖厂在内，全国共增加制糖能力二十五万吨。1956年全国糖的年产量比1952年增长了近一倍，其中机制糖已经占到71％。
    四年来，在我国内蒙古、黑龙江等主要牛奶产地新建改建了几十个乳制品工厂。到现在全国已经有八十三个各种乳制品工厂，年产量比1952年增长了一倍以上。新建的大型奶粉厂是按照最新标准设计的，整个生产过程都是自动化和机械化的。
    我国在解放以前只有几家小型罐头厂。四年来经过扩建和改建，现在全国已经有二十六个罐头厂，年产量比1952年增长了两倍多。罐头的品种也大大增加了。1953年以前大多是肉类、水果罐头，品种很少，近几年来试制成功了各种蔬菜、水果等七十多种新罐头，这些新罐头受到了国内外消费者的欢迎。
    四年来新建扩建了几十个油厂。由于设备的增加，1956年全国食用植物油的产量比1952年增长了21％。新建的油厂中，有每天处理原料两百吨以上的大型油脂化学厂，可以综合利用废料和副产品生产肥皂、糖醛等产品。
    我国的烟、酒产量增长也很快。1956年全国烟的产量比1952年增长了45％以上，酒的产量比1952年增长了两倍多；其中果酒、色酒的比重大大增加。对于生产世界著名的山西杏花村汾酒、贵州茅台酒等名酒的工厂，国家还拨出了专款进行了扩建和增添设备，保持了这些名酒的优良特点。
    此外，糖果、冷饮、面包、饼干等食品，近四年来也增加了一百多种新产品。著名的金华火腿、南京板鸭、镇江和山西的陈醋等产品不但产量有所增加，并且保持了原有的风味。
    我国食品工业在短短的四年中能够获得巨大的发展，主要是国家工农业迅速发展的结果。目前食品工业的生产潜力还很大，如果原料充足，还能生产更多更好的食品。
    糖——1956年产量比1952年增长近一倍；全国新建扩建九十二个
          糖厂，增加制糖能力二十五万吨。乳制品——年产量增长
          一倍以上；新建和改建了几十个乳制品工厂。
    罐头——年产量增长两倍多；罐头厂从几个小厂增加到二十六个。
            食用植物油——年产量增长21％；新建扩建几十个油厂。
    烟、酒——烟产量增长45％以上；酒产量增长两倍多。
