    The "Regional Blockade" of Liuhe County
    During the winter construction of the Fushun Oxygen Plant's basic construction, workers doing outdoor work urgently need to wear cotton galoshes; however, large-size cotton galoshes are currently out of stock in Fushun City, and workers with large feet cannot buy suitable shoes. To solve this problem, the Oxygen Plant sent purchasing agents to run around everywhere. As a result, I came to Sanyuan Town in Liuhe County, Jilin Province, at the beginning of December last year. In this town, the three stores together had more than two thousand pairs of large-size cotton galoshes in stock, but the store clerks dared not sell these shoes to us. It is said that the Liuhe County Supply and Marketing Cooperative stipulates that they cannot be sold to other places, so as to avoid out-of-stock situations in the county. In fact, Liuhe County is an agricultural area, and most of the farmers here have already put on "Ula" shoes made of cowhide. The cotton shoes they want to buy are already prepared, so the sales of cotton galoshes in this town are already small. We believe that the regulation of the Liuhe County Supply and Marketing Cooperative prohibiting the sale of shoes to other places is obviously unreasonable, and we hope that the Jilin Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative can help us solve this problem.

    柳河县的“地区封锁”
    抚顺氧气厂基本建设的冬季施工中，露天作业的工人迫切需要穿棉胶鞋；可是，现在抚顺市的大号棉胶鞋脱销，脚大的工人买不到合适的鞋穿。为了解决这个问题，氧气厂派了采购员到处奔走。我在去年12月初因此来到了吉林省柳河县三源镇，在这个镇里，共有三个商店就积压了两千多双大号棉胶鞋，可是商店的营业员不敢把这些鞋卖给我们，据说是柳河县供销社规定不能卖给外埠，以免本县脱销，事实上，柳河县是农业区，这里的农民大部分都穿上了牛皮制成的“乌拉”，他们要买的棉鞋都已经备妥，因此这个镇的棉胶鞋销路已经不大。我们认为柳河县供销社不准把鞋卖给外埠的规定，显然是不合理的，希望吉林省供销社能够帮助我们解决这个问题。  周成德
