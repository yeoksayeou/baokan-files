Title: Who to Compare With, What to Compare

Some comrades often like to "compare" themselves with others. If used properly, comparison is a valid method for measuring and judging things. The question is, who to compare with, and what to compare.

When old friends get together and chat, they often bring up old acquaintances to compare, comparing the heights of their positions, the generosity of their treatment, the depth of their seniority, the strength of their abilities; even whether they have a car when they go out, or whether they sit in soft-seat carriages on the train, are all included in the content of the "comparison." After comparing this and that, they inevitably feel some emotion, feeling that the Party has treated others well but treated themselves poorly.

When it comes to streamlining institutions and transferring cadres downward, many comrades express their support for this method, but when they are selected, they start to grumble. Some people find some comrades whose situation is similar to their own and compare them. The conclusion is: since everyone's situation is similar, why not transfer others but me? Must the hard work always fall on me! Thus, they are full of complaints and cannot happily obey the assignment.

The content of these comrades' "comparisons" can be numerous, but they have one thing in common, that is, they compare ability, qualifications… with those who they consider less capable and less senior than themselves; they compare position, treatment, and enjoyment with those who have high positions, good treatment, and live comfortably; their purpose is nothing more than to fight for position, fight for treatment, and escape hard life for themselves. The result is that various individualistic thoughts become more and more dominant in these comrades' minds.

If we are to compare, we should compare ourselves with comrades like Ni Jieyu, the county magistrate and second secretary of the County Party Committee of Miyun County. And not just compare life, compare treatment, but also compare mass viewpoints, work style…. It might also be worthwhile to put yourself in Ni Jieyu's position and consider whether you could work contentedly in the mountainous area for a long time like him; whether you could voluntarily and happily climb mountains and wade through rivers, eat pickled cabbage and steamed sweet potatoes; whether you could share the fate and breathe the same air as the people in the mountainous area, and have such deep feelings and beautiful ideals for the mountainous area….

The result of such a comparison will arouse noble feelings, and even if you originally had some less good personal plans in your mind, you will feel ashamed in front of these comrades, and it will give you the strength to dispel various bad thoughts. Compare yourself more with those good comrades who do not care about personal gains and losses, endure hardship first and enjoy later, work deeply and practically, and share weal and woe with the masses. This comparison is actually a good way to transform oneself and improve oneself.

### 和谁比，比什么

    和谁比，比什么
    宋琤
    有些同志常常喜欢和人“比”。只要运用得当，比，不失为衡量、判断事物的一种方法。问题在于和谁比，比什么。
    老朋友们一谈起天来，常常就扯出很多过去的老相识来相比，比地位高低，比待遇厚薄；比资历深浅，比能力强弱，甚至出门有没有汽车、坐火车是不是软席，也都列入“比”的内容。比来比去，总不免有些感慨，觉得党厚待了别人，薄待了自己。
    要精简机构下放干部了，很多同志都表示拥护这个办法，可是一抽调到自己的头上，就嘀咕起来了。有的人找出一些和自己情况差不多的同志来比较一番。结论是：既然大家的情况都差不多，为什么不调别人偏偏要调我呢？苦事情就一定要轮到我吗！于是满腹牢骚，不能愉快地服从分配。
    这些同志“比”的内容可以有很多，但是有一个共同点，那就是和那些自认为比自己能力差、资历浅……的人，比能力、比资格……；和地位高的、待遇好的、生活条件优裕的，比地位、比待遇、比享受；其目的则不外乎给自己争地位、争待遇、逃避艰苦生活。其结果无非是各种个人主义思想在这些同志的脑袋中越来越占上风。
    要比，就要和密云县县长、县委第二书记倪介瑜这样的同志比。而且不只是比生活、比待遇，还可以比比群众观点、工作作风……。也不妨再设身处地的考虑一下，如果自己处于倪介瑜同志这样的地位，能不能像他那样长期安心于山区工作；能不能自愿而愉快地登山涉水、吃熬酸菜、蒸白薯；能不能和山区群众同命运共呼吸，对山区有着那样深厚的感情和美好的理想……。
    这样比的结果，将会激发起高尚的情感，即使你心里原来有一些不大好的个人打算，在这些同志面前也会感到羞愧，而且会使自己有力量打消各种不好的念头。多向那些不计较个人得失的、吃苦在前、享受在后、工作深入踏实和群众同甘共苦的好同志比一比吧。这比较其实就是改造自己、提高自己的一个好方法。
