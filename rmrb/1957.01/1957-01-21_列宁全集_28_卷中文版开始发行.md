Xinhua News Agency, January 20th: The Chinese translation of Volume 28 of "Lenin's Collected Works" was published on January 7th and will be available in Beijing starting January 21st. Distribution will follow successively in other parts of the country.

This volume includes Lenin's works from July 1918 to March 1919, the initial period of the Soviet Civil War and foreign armed intervention. These works reflect Lenin's outstanding activities as the leader of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet state, and his great contributions to the international communist cause. Studying these works allows us to profoundly understand how Lenin, under extremely difficult conditions during this period, formulated correct lines and policies, mobilized and led the people of the entire Soviet Union to resist the attacks of domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary forces, defend the fruits of the October Revolution, and promote the consolidation and victory of the Soviet system. Moreover, we can see how Lenin waged an irreconcilable struggle against opportunism, and defended and developed Marxist theory.

This volume contains Lenin's classic work "The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky." In this work, Lenin mercilessly exposed Kautsky's and the Second International's opportunist stance and their slavish attitude towards imperialism, pointing out that Kautsky and other leaders of the Second International had completely abandoned Marxism on the most fundamental issues of class struggle, the theory of the state, the proletarian revolution, and the dictatorship of the proletariat. They had fallen into the quagmire of opportunism and revisionism, becoming traitors to the proletariat and accomplices of the bourgeoisie. Lenin vehemently criticized Kautsky's so-called "pure" democracy, which was actually a shameless attempt to praise the absolute rule of the imperialist bourgeoisie. He profoundly analyzed the fundamental differences and opposition between proletarian democracy and bourgeois democracy, pointing out the boundless superiority of proletarian democracy. He said that bourgeois democracy was a historical advance compared to serfdom, but it was always narrow, incomplete, and utterly hypocritical. Bourgeois democracy is the democracy of a tiny minority of rich people and exploiters, and it is a trap and a fraud for the poor and the exploited. Only proletarian democracy is true democracy for the broad masses of working people. Therefore, "Proletarian democracy is a million times more democratic than any bourgeois democracy; Soviet power is a million times more democratic than the most democratic bourgeois republic." While criticizing Kautsky's opportunist viewpoints, Lenin further clarified the Marxist theory of revolution, developed the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the state, explained the essence of proletarian internationalism, and demonstrated the basic principles of internationalist strategy.

In works such as "On 'Democracy' and Dictatorship," "Letter to American Workers," and "Achievements and Objects in the Struggle," Lenin also analyzed Soviet democracy and criticized bourgeois democracy. In the "Theses and Report on Bourgeois Democracy and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" at the First Congress of the Communist International, and the resolution on these theses, Lenin brilliantly demonstrated the proposition that for the benefit of all working masses, the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat must be implemented. Only through the dictatorship of the proletariat can exploitation and classes be eliminated and can we move towards communism. The principles put forward by Lenin became the basis of the program of the Communist International.

In "Letter to American Workers" and the speech on the international situation at the Sixth Extraordinary Congress of Soviets of Workers', Peasants', Cossacks', and Red Army Deputies, Lenin thoroughly exposed the imperialist predatory nature of the First World War, and the colonialist essence of British, French, and especially American imperialism, and their methods of enslavement and oppression under the guise of so-called "aid" and "protection." Lenin pointed out that the American billionaires made the most money in the First World War, "They have turned all the countries, even the richest, into their tributaries." "Every dollar is tainted with dirt, with the 'profitable' military orders that made fortunes for the rich in every country and ruined the poor." Every dollar is soaked in human blood. The American bourgeoisie are "civilized" vampires. The birth of the Soviet Socialist Republic aroused great hatred among American billionaires, who spared no effort to try to strangle it. As Lenin revealed: "Precisely now, the American billionaires, these modern slave owners, have opened a particularly tragic page in the bloody history of bloody imperialism; they have agreed to the armed intervention by the British and Japanese beasts to strangle the first socialist republic, regardless of whether this agreement is direct or indirect, open or cleverly concealed, it is the same."

A large part of this volume consists of reports and speeches made by Lenin at workers' rallies, congresses of Soviets and trade unions, meetings of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and the Moscow City Conference of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and meetings of other organizations. In these reports and speeches, Lenin put forward the great call to defend the socialist motherland; planned a series of wise and decisive measures on how to establish and strengthen the Red Army, fully support the Red Army and consolidate its rear, in order to crush the White Guard bandits and foreign armed interventionists.

Many works in this volume discuss the development of the socialist revolution in the countryside and the attitude towards middle peasants. These are: "Letter to the Workers of Yelets," "Comrade Workers! Let Us All Engage in the Last Decisive Battle!", "Speech to the Representatives of the Poor Peasants' Committees of Moscow Province," "Speech at the First All-Russian Congress of Land Departments, Committees of Poor Peasants, and Communes," etc.

In his famous essay "Valuable Admissions of Pitirim Sorokin," Lenin proposed the policy that the proletariat and the Communist Party in the countryside must "know how to come to an agreement with the middle peasant, not give up the struggle against the kulak for a minute, and only firmly rely on the poor peasant." This policy was approved by the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party and became the class line in the countryside during the transition period. In the "Draft Telegram to Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies at All Levels on the Issue of the Worker-Peasant Alliance" and "Speech at the Congress of Soviets, Poor Peasants' Committees and District Committees of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Moscow Province," clear instructions were given on consolidating and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance.

In the speech on the first anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution at the Sixth Extraordinary Congress of Soviets of Workers', Peasants', Cossacks' and Red Army Deputies and in the "Report on the Attitude of the Proletariat Towards Petty-Bourgeois Democrats" and the conclusion at the Moscow Party Workers' Conference, Lenin demonstrated the attitude and policy that the proletariat should adopt towards the petty-bourgeois democrats who are turning to the Soviet power, and pointed out the path to attract intellectuals and old experts to participate in socialist construction.

In documents such as the "Draft Regulations on the Management of Soviet Organs" and "Correspondence with Stalin on the Reorganization of the People's Commissariat of State Control," Lenin proposed that in order to improve the work of state organs, the principles of collective leadership and individual responsibility must be implemented. He said: "All management issues in Soviet organs should be decided through collective discussion, while clearly stipulating the responsibility of each person holding a Soviet position for performing certain tasks and practical work." In addition, it is also necessary to resolutely oppose bureaucracy and procrastination, establish a system for people to visit and boldly expose bad people and bad deeds, and eliminate these undesirable phenomena; it is necessary to save manpower as much as possible and use people's labor most effectively, streamline institutions and personnel, and improve work efficiency.

"On the Issue of Enrollment in Soviet Russian Higher Education Institutions," "Speech at the First All-Russian Congress on Education," "Speech at the Second Conference of Heads of Social Education Departments of Provincial People's Education Departments," and the letter "To the People's Commissariat of Education" on the issue of rectifying library work, reflect Lenin's activities in Soviet cultural construction.

In addition, this volume also includes: "Telegram to Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies at All Levels and the People of the Whole Country" written due to the revolution in Germany, "On the Nature of Our Newspapers," "Speech at the Unveiling Ceremony of the Marx-Engels Monument," "On the Tasks of Trade Unions," "Speech on the Assassination of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht," the draft resolution of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee "On Confiscating Menshevik Newspapers that Undermine National Defense" and "Draft of the Radio Telegram of the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs" and other works and documents.

    列宁全集28卷中文版开始发行
    新华社20日讯　“列宁全集”第二十八卷中文译本已经在1月7日出版，21日开始在北京发行。全国其他各地也将陆续发行。
    这一卷包括列宁在1918年7月至1919年3月、即苏联国内战争和外国武装干涉初期的著作。这些著作反映了列宁作为苏联共产党的领袖和苏维埃国家的领导者的卓越的活动，反映了列宁对于国际共产主义事业的伟大贡献。学习和研究这些著作，不仅可以深刻地了解列宁在这一时期的极端困难的条件下，如何制定正确的路线、政策，动员和领导全苏联人民反对国内、外反革命势力的进攻，保卫十月革命的果实，促进苏维埃制度的巩固和胜利，而且可以看到列宁如何同机会主义进行不调和的斗争，保卫和发展了马克思主义理论。
    本卷载有列宁的经典著作“无产阶级革命和叛徒考茨基”。在这部著作中，列宁无情地揭露了考茨基和第二国际的机会主义立场及其对帝国主义的奴颜婢膝的态度，指出考茨基及第二国际的其他领袖们，在关于阶级斗争、关于国家学说、关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政这些最基本的问题上，已经完全背弃了马克思主义，而堕入机会主义和修正主义的泥坑，成为无产阶级的叛徒和资产阶级的帮凶。列宁痛斥了考茨基的所谓“纯粹的”民主而实际是赞扬帝国主义资产阶级的绝对统治的无耻企图。他深刻地分析了无产阶级民主和资产阶级民主的根本区别和对立，指出了无产阶级民主的无限的优越性。他说，资产阶级民主与农奴制比起来是历史上的一个进步，但它始终是狭隘的、残缺不全和虚伪透顶的。资产阶级民主是极少数富人和剥削者的民主，它对穷人和被剥削者乃是陷阱和骗局。只有无产阶级民主才是供广大劳动人民享受的真正民主。因此，“无产阶级民主比任何资产阶级民主要民主百万倍；苏维埃政权比最民主的资产阶级共和国要民主百万倍。”在批判考茨基的机会主义观点的同时，列宁进一步阐明了马克思主义的革命论，发展了无产阶级专政和国家的学说，说明了无产阶级国际主义的实质，并论证了国际主义策略的基本原则。
    在“论‘民主’和专政”、“给欧美工人的信”、“争取到的和记载下来的东西”等著作中，列宁也分析了苏维埃民主和批判了资产阶级的民主。在共产国际第一次代表大会上“关于资产阶级民主和无产阶级专政的提纲和报告”及关于这个提纲的决议中，列宁天才地论证了这样的命题：为了全体劳动群众的利益，必须实行无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，只有经过无产阶级专政，才能消灭剥削和阶级，才能走向共产主义。列宁提出的这些原理，成了共产国际的纲领的基础。
    在“给美国工人的信”和在全俄工、农、哥萨克和红军代表苏维埃第六次非常代表大会上关于国际形势的演说等著作中，列宁彻底揭露了第一次世界大战的帝国主义掠夺性质，揭露了英、法，特别是美帝国主义的殖民主义实质及其在所谓“援助”、“保护”的借口下进行奴役、压迫的手法。列宁指出，美国的亿万富翁们在第一次世界大战中发财最多，“他们把所有的国家，甚至最富有的国家，都变成了向自己进贡的国家”。“每一块美元都有污迹，都有使每个国家的富人发财、穷人破产的‘有利可得的’军事定货的污迹。”每一块美元都浸透着人类的鲜血。美国的资产阶级乃是“文明的”吸血鬼。苏维埃社会主义共和国的诞生，引起了美国亿万富翁们的极大仇视，他们不惜一切力量企图来窒息它。正如列宁所揭露的：“正是目前，美国的亿万富翁们，这些现代的奴隶主，揭开了血腥的帝国主义的血腥史上特别悲惨的一页；同意了英、日野兽们为扼死第一个社会主义共和国而举行的武装进攻，不管这种同意是直接的还是间接的，是公开的还是巧妙地掩盖起来的，都是一样。”
    本卷内有很大一部分是列宁在工人集会、苏维埃的和工会的代表大会、全俄中央执行委员会会议和俄共（布）莫斯科市代表会议以及其他组织的会议上所作的报告和演说。列宁在这些报告和演说中，提出了保卫社会主义祖国的伟大号召；规划了如何建立和加强红军，全力支援红军和巩固红军后方的一系列英明、坚决的措施，以粉碎白卫匪军和外国武装干涉者。
    本卷有许多著作论述了农村中社会主义革命的发展和对中农的态度问题。这就是：“给叶列茨工人的信”，“工人同志们！大家都来进行最后一次决战！”，“对莫斯科省贫农委员会代表的演说”，“在全俄土地科、贫农委员会和公社第一次代表大会上的演说”等等。
    列宁在“皮梯利姆·索罗金的宝贵自供”这篇著名论文中，提出了无产阶级和共产党在农村必须要“善于同中农达成协议，一分钟也不放弃对富农的斗争，只是牢牢地依靠贫农”的方针，这个方针经俄共第八次代表大会批准而成为过渡时期农村的阶级路线。在“关于工农联盟问题给各级工兵农代表苏维埃的电报草稿”和“在莫斯科省苏维埃、贫农委员会和俄共（布）区委员会代表大会上的演说”中，对于巩固和加强工农联盟问题，作了明确的指示。
    在全俄工、农、哥萨克和红军代表苏维埃第六次非常代表大会上关于十月社会主义革命一周年的演说和在莫斯科党的工作人员大会上“关于无产阶级对小资产阶级民主派的态度的报告”和结论中，列宁论证了无产阶级对于转向苏维埃政权的小资产阶级民主派应该采取的态度和政策，并指出了吸引知识分子和旧专家参加社会主义建设事业的道路。
    在“关于苏维埃机关管理工作的规定草案”和“关于改组国家监察部问题同斯大林的通信”等文件中，列宁提出，为了改善国家机关的工作，必须实行集体领导和个人负责的原则。他说：“苏维埃机关中的一切管理问题应该通过集体讨论来决定，同时要极明确地规定每个担任苏维埃职务的人对执行一定的任务和实际工作所担负的责任”。另外，还必须坚决反对官僚主义和拖拉作风，建立人民来访制度，大胆地揭发坏人坏事，消除这些不良的现象；必须尽量节省人力和最有成效地使用人民的劳动，精简机构和人员，提高工作效率。
    “关于苏俄高等学校的招生问题”、“在全俄教育工作第一次代表大会上的演说”、“在各省国民教育厅社会教育处处长第二次会议上的演说”以及就整顿图书馆工作问题“给教育人民委员部”的信，反映了列宁在苏维埃文化建设方面的活动。
    另外，本卷还包括：由于德国发生革命而写的“给各级工兵农代表苏维埃和全国人民的电报”、“论我们报纸的性质”、“在马克思恩格斯纪念碑揭幕典礼上的讲话”、“论工会的任务”、“就罗莎·卢森堡和卡尔·李卜克内西被害事件而发表的演说”、全俄中央执行委员会“关于查封破坏国防的孟什维克报纸”的决议草案和“外交人民委员的无线电报草稿”等著作和文件。
