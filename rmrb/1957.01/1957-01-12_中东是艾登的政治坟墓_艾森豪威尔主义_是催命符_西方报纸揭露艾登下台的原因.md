Xinhua News Agency, 11th - British Prime Minister Eden's resignation has been a central topic of commentary in newspapers in Britain, the United States, France, and West Germany on the 10th.

British newspapers have been discussing the real reasons for Eden's resignation. The Times said that Eden's resignation was due to his making a "damaging misjudgment" on the Suez Canal issue. The Daily Express pointed out that no prime minister had ever been subjected to as much condemnation in Parliament and in newspapers as Eden had been, and that at such a difficult moment, "he did not have the support of some of his most important colleagues."

Many American newspapers ran Eden's resignation news under prominent headlines on the 10th. The New York Times said: "The immediate cause of his (Eden's) departure is undoubtedly the failure of the Anglo-French intervention in Egypt, which caused a political and military collapse with serious implications for Britain, Europe, and many countries in the free world." The Chicago Tribune pointed out that the Middle East was the place where Eden's political grave was dug. The New York Herald Tribune believes that Eisenhower's recent refusal to receive Eden in Washington was one of the reasons for Eden's downfall.

The French newspaper Le Figaro, commenting on Eden's resignation, pointed out that the announcement of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" accelerated Eden's resignation.

West Germany's Cologne Review believes that "Eisenhower's announcement of a policy toward the Middle East that excluded British opinion seemed like an irresistible lever that pried Eden out of his saddle."

    中东是艾登的政治坟墓
    “艾森豪威尔主义”是催命符
    西方报纸揭露艾登下台的原因
    据新华社11日讯　英国首相艾登辞职，是英、美、法、西德等国报纸10日评论的一个中心。
    英国报纸纷纷谈论艾登辞职的真正原因。“泰晤士报”说，艾登辞职是因为他在苏伊士运河问题上作出了“有害的错误判断”。“每日快报”指出，从来没有一个首相在议会中和报纸上遭到过像艾登所遭到的那样多的谴责，而在这样一种困难的时刻，“他又没有得到一些最重要的同事们的支持”。
    美国许多报纸10日都以头号大标题刊载艾登辞职的消息。“纽约时报”说：“他（艾登）离职的直接原因无疑是英法对埃及的干涉的失败，这次干涉造成了对英国、欧洲和自由世界的许多国家有严重影响的政治和军事崩溃。”“芝加哥论坛报”指出，中东是挖掘艾登政治坟墓的地点。“纽约先驱论坛报”认为，最近以来艾森豪威尔一直拒绝在华盛顿接见艾登是艾登垮台的原因之一。
    法国“费加罗报”在评论艾登辞职的时候指出，“艾森豪威尔主义”的宣布加速了艾登的辞职。
    西德的“科隆评论”认为，“艾森豪威尔宣布对中东的政策方面排除英国意见，这好像是一根把艾登撬出了他的座鞍的不可抗拒的杠杆”。
