Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 24th: The 301 Coal Mining Team of the First Coal Mine and the "May Fourth" Youth Tunneling Team of the Third Coal Mine of the Tongchuan Mining Bureau fully realized the conditions for the national coal mine inter-mine same-trade competition last year and have recently been selected as national winning teams. These two teams received a total of more than 2,300 yuan in prize money.

During the competition, both teams attached importance to promoting advanced experience and solving weak links and key problems in production. The "May Fourth" Youth Tunneling Team experienced many reworkings in tunneling and excavating roadways in March and April last year. They then promoted Li Baoshu's advanced experience of "three-point extension line to determine roadway direction," which increased tunneling efficiency by more than one time and created a new tunneling record in May. When the 301 Coal Mining Team promoted the "one-meter layer" management experience, they implemented a segmented contract mixed operation method, strengthening cooperation between shifts and ensuring that the plan was completed every month thereafter.

    铜川煤矿的荣誉
    据新华社西安24日电　铜川矿务局第一煤矿三○一采煤队和第三煤矿“五四”青年掘进队，去年全面实现了全国煤矿矿际同工种竞赛的条件，最近都被选为全国优胜队。这两个队共得奖金二千三百多元。
    这两个队在竞赛期间，都重视推行先进经验，解决生产中的薄弱环节和关键问题。“五四”青年掘进队去年三、四月间在掘进开采巷道的时候返工很多，他们就推行了李宝书的“三点延线定巷方向”先进经验，使掘进效率提高一倍多，并且在5月份创造了掘进新纪录。三○一采煤队在推行“一公尺层”管理经验的时候，实行了分段包干混合作业法，加强了班和班之间的合作，保证了以后月月完成计划。
