    In the Rural Areas of the Northwest Plateau
    By Our Correspondent Zhu Bo
    Not long before the New Year, I visited the rural areas of Shaanxi Province. I went to both sides of the Wei River, the imperial tomb area, and the mountain villages on the Qinling Mountains. Before I set off, I heard people say that the situation in the countryside in the winter of 1956 was not as encouraging as in the winter of 1955. However, what we felt during our visit to the rural areas of Shaanxi was not like that at all. On the contrary, we saw many gratifying phenomena. This is the result of the first year of comprehensive harvest after the collectivization of Shaanxi Province.
    According to comrades from the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture, Shaanxi Province had a bumper harvest of grain, cotton, and oil crops in 1956. The total grain output was 11.5 billion jin, an increase of 2.5 billion jin over 1955; the total cotton output was 2.4 million dan (lint), an increase of 900,000 dan over 1955; and the oil crops sesame, peanuts, and rapeseed all increased by more than 10 million jin.
    At the Lintong County People's Committee, we visited several comrades from the Statistics Section. They were working intensively on agricultural production statistics. In the imagination of most people, statistics work is always boring. However, we saw that they were doing this work with great interest. The increase in production itself increased their interest. After they talked about the main figures of the county's increased production, they said excitedly: Lintong County has basically eliminated the shortage of grain and has become a surplus grain county! Li Haiting, a young statistician, had just returned from a survey in the countryside. He said that 1956 was very different from the past, and he had more energy to work. Then, he told us about the situation in Xingzhe Township. This township is a general township, with a total of eighteen primary cooperatives and eight advanced cooperatives, and each cooperative has increased production. One advanced cooperative increased production by 20%, one by about 25%, and six by more than 30%. Among the primary cooperatives, two increased production by less than 10%, three by 10%-20%, five by 20%-30%, and eight by more than 30%. Due to the increase in production in the cooperatives, the income of most members increased. According to the survey of the Luojia Village cooperative in this township, the cooperative has a total of 58 households. The income of nine members increased by less than 10%, six by 10%-20%, five by 20%-50%, and thirty-three by 50% to one or two times; the income of two households did not increase or decrease; and only three households had a decrease in income. These three households could not finish the grain they were allocated either. For example, Jing Deyou, an upper-middle peasant whose income decreased, has nine people in his family, each with more than 1,000 jin of grain. Some "five-guarantee" households in this cooperative also received more than 450 jin of grain per person. The situation in other agricultural cooperatives we visited personally was similar to that of this cooperative, and the production increase of some cooperatives even exceeded this cooperative. In the Xinfeng District, Comrade Zhou Jiwu, Secretary of the District Party Committee, told us that the average yield per mu in Xinfeng District in 1956 was more than 500 jin, while the yield per mu in 1955 was only more than 300 jin. There is grain everywhere here. Corn is hanging on the trees, and wheat, millet, and beans are stored in the houses. When Xinfeng Third Cooperative distributed the autumn harvest, 30% of the members (a total of 424 households in the cooperative) were unwilling to receive grain. They asked for cash because the wheat distributed in the summer was enough to eat.
    The situation in Weinan, Pucheng, Dali, Liquan, Xianyang, Wugong and other counties is similar to that in Lintong. The county party secretaries of these counties told us that the grain harvested in 1956 could not be eaten in one year. For example, the average amount of grain produced in Pucheng County in 1956, after deducting the public grain and completing the grain purchase task, was 1,000 jin per person for the farmers. A considerable number of cooperatives received enough grain to eat for two or three years.
    The increase in grain production has brought about tremendous changes in the countryside. A year ago, many people were still clamoring for a shortage of grain, and the grain retail stores were crowded with people buying grain all day long. What about now? The grain purchasing and marketing stations are still crowded with people, but they are not buyers but sellers. We visited several grain purchasing and marketing stations. In the Xinfeng Purchasing and Marketing Station of the Lintong Grain Bureau, the courtyard of more than two mu was filled with bags of grain. Some of these grains were sent in accordance with the sales task, and some were surplus grain beyond the sales task. Comrade Zhai Junyi of the purchasing and marketing station saw us and said with a smile: "Have you seen it! There are so many every day, and at least 60,000 to 70,000 jin of grain are collected every day. It's terrible, the warehouse is almost full!" Then he introduced the situation of this station to us. This station is responsible for the purchasing and marketing tasks of four townships in Xinfeng District. In 1955, this station had the largest number of grain sales in the county, a total of more than 2 million jin. It started selling grain in October. At most, it received 400 buyers a day and sold 30,000 to 40,000 jin of grain. There was no stock in the warehouse, and it was all purchased and sold at the same time. The situation has completely changed now. In 1956, the original plan was to purchase 1.01 million jin, and then it was increased to 1.05 million jin. Now, the purchase plan has long been completed, and the additional purchase plan is also about to be completed. The county grain bureau assigned this purchasing and marketing station a sales task of more than 390,000 jin in 1956, but so far, not a single jin of grain has been sold. According to the investigation by the comrades of the grain station, the four townships only need to supply 22,500 jin.
    Because of the large surplus of grain, the free grain market in the rural areas of Shaanxi has gradually sprung up. There are nine market days in Xinfeng Town, Lintong County every month. When the market days come, the members carry grain here to sell, and the trading volume per market day is more than 10,000 jin. Many cooperatives and members are worried because they cannot sell the grain. The Heping Cooperative in Shuangwang Township, Weinan County, still has 100,000 jin of corn and 20,000 jin of sprouted wheat in stock. The members have already sold more than 20,000 jin of grain in the free market, and they still have to sell 50,000 to 60,000 jin. We often encountered members of agricultural cooperatives pushing grain for sale in this area, and they expressed dissatisfaction because the grain could not be sold. An agricultural cooperative member said: My sprouted wheat is not bad, but no one wants it for six cents a jin. The grain department has not seen these new situations. Many areas do not need to supply grain in winter and spring, but they have formulated huge plans to sell grain.
    Due to the bumper harvest, agricultural cooperatives have become more consolidated, and advanced collectivization has developed very rapidly. Before October last year, the number of farmers in the province who joined advanced cooperatives accounted for 64% of the total number of farmers. By winter, the province had achieved advanced collectivization.
    The collectivization movement in the winter of 1956 did not seem as lively as in 1955, and there was no drumming. However, as long as you observe carefully, you will find that the development of this movement is very healthy. This is because there was both a bumper harvest and democracy was promoted. We visited Xiekou Township in Lintong County. When this township expanded and merged cooperatives, the cadres who established the cooperatives adopted the mass line working method and conducted investigation, research, persuasion, and education work in advance for those farmers who had not joined the cooperatives. In the past, the election of cooperative cadres was done by the Party branch proposing a list of candidates. Now, it has been changed to the masses first proposing a list of candidates, which is then studied by the branch and the cooperative establishment committee, submitted to the members for group discussion, passed by the members' congress, and finally elected. The members are very satisfied with this practice. Some people say that if we used numbers to calculate the achievements in the past, then we should add one more item today, that is, to measure the achievements of today's collectivization by the ideological awareness of the broad masses of members. Where is the ideological awareness of the members reflected here? That is the sentence they like to say: After joining the cooperative, you can't be carried out even by an eight-carried palanquin.
    In the several counties we visited, some upper-middle peasants whose income decreased expressed dissatisfaction with collectivization, and some even asked to withdraw from the cooperative. However, not all upper-middle peasants have reduced their income. The Secretary of the Pucheng County Party Committee told us that they investigated the situation of the upper-middle peasants in several agricultural cooperatives. In the Houquan Agricultural Cooperative in Shilipu Township, there are a total of 265 households, and the income of 263 households has increased, including 20 upper-middle peasant households. For example, Lei Mingxin, an upper-middle peasant with a family of seven, received more than 360 yuan in the primary cooperative the year before last, and received a total of more than 770 yuan last year. According to Lei Mingxin himself, the reason for the increase in income last year was that his whole family worked actively and earned more work points. Some upper-middle peasants who did not believe in the superiority of advanced cooperatives and did not work actively, and therefore reduced their income, have realized this. They said, "It's not a loss to reduce income, see you next year!"
    Before our visit, we heard some people say that winter production in 1956 was not as good as in 1955. There is some truth in this statement. A slackening phenomenon occurred in some areas after the autumn harvest. The reason is that some leaders and grassroots cadres have shown signs of being cautious after opposing subjectivism, and have not grasped the leadership of winter production. From the perspective of the masses, the main reason is that they have worked hard for a year, and they have also achieved a comprehensive harvest in the autumn, so they want to take a break and do some of their own things. In the "May 1st" cooperative in Xianyang County, we asked many cooperative cadres and visited many members about this issue. They all said that they had been working hard for a year, and their own affairs had been put aside. Now that there is a bumper harvest and their income has increased, everyone wants to take this opportunity to repair their houses, build a house, and the women want to dismantle, wash, and make cotton clothes and cotton shoes for the whole family. Some families also have to prepare dowries for their daughters.... Therefore, winter production is not as tense as in the spring of 1956. This statement is reasonable. In other places, we have also seen that the members do not have places to store the grain they have distributed, and a large number of corn is still hanging on the trees. It is necessary to give the members some time to take care of household affairs. Of course, there is also an abnormal situation. For example, in the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Liquan County, the grain harvested by the whole cooperative can be eaten for two or three years, so some people are not active in winter production. They said, "Let's take a rest in the winter. If the harvest is not good next year, we won't starve." Generally speaking, the relaxation of winter production is only a temporary phenomenon in a few areas. Everywhere we have been, we can see members of agricultural cooperatives carrying out winter irrigation, winter plowing, and sending manure.
    Judging from the current situation, the biggest problem in the rural areas of Shaanxi is the lack of draught animals. According to the statistics of the Department of Agriculture at the end of October, the number of draught animals in the province has decreased by 10,000 to 20,000, and the draught animals are generally thin and weak. The most serious problem is that the breeding rate of draught animals is very low. According to the survey of Longyang Township in Pucheng County, there are 600 to 700 breeding female animals in the township, and most of them have not been mated. The main reason for this phenomenon is that the work in the cooperatives is too busy, and the members are afraid that mating the female animals will affect production. At present, leaders at all levels have begun to pay attention to solving these problems.

    在西北高原的农村里
    本报记者　朱波
    新年以前不久，我访问了陕西省的农村。到过渭河两岸，到过帝王陵一带，也到过秦岭上的山庄。在出发以前听人说：1956年冬天农村的情况不如1955年冬季那样令人高兴。但是，我们在访问陕西农村的时候所感觉到的却不是这样。恰恰相反，我们看到了许多可喜的现象。这是陕西省合作化后第一年全面丰收带来的结果。
    据陕西省农业厅的同志说，1956年陕西省粮食、棉花和油料作物都获得了丰收。粮食总产量一百一十五亿斤，比1955年增加了二十五亿斤；棉花总产量二百四十万担（皮棉），比1955年增加了九十万担；油料作物芝麻、花生、油菜籽都增加了一千多万斤。
    在临潼县人民委员会，我们访问了统计科的几个同志。他们正在紧张地进行农业生产统计工作。在一般人的想像中，统计工作总是枯燥无味的。但是，我们却看到他们非常有兴趣地在做这个工作。增产数字本身给他们增加了兴趣。他们谈了全县增产的几个主要数字以后，兴奋地说：临潼县基本上消灭了缺粮现象，成了余粮县了！年青的统计员李海停刚从农村中调查回来，他说，1956年比以前大不同了，工作更有劲了。接着，他把行者乡的情况告诉了我们。这个乡是个一般的乡，共有十八个初级社，八个高级社，每个社都增产了。高级社增产20％的一个社，25％左右的一个社，30％以上的六个社。初级社增产10％以下的二个社，10％—20％的三个社，20％—30％的五个社，30％以上的八个社。由于社里增产，大部分社员的收入都增加了。据这个乡罗家村社的调查，这个社共五十八户，社员增加收入10％以下的九户，10％—20％的六户，20％—50％的五户，50％至一、二倍的三十三户；收入不增不减的两户；减少收入的只有三户。这三户分的粮食也吃不完。例如，减少收入的上中农景德有，九口人，每人合一千多斤粮食。这个社有些“五保”户，每口人也都分到四百五十斤以上的粮食。我们亲自访问过的其它农业社，情况和这个社差不多，有些社的增产成绩还超过这个社。在新丰区，区委书记周继武同志告诉我们说，新丰区1956年每亩平均产量是五百多斤，而1955年亩产只有三百多斤。这里到处都是粮食，树上挂的是玉米，房子里放的是麦子、谷子、豆子。新丰三社秋收分配的时候，有30％的社员（全社共四百二十四户）不愿要粮食，他们要求分给现金，因为夏季分配的麦子已经够吃了。
    渭南、蒲城、大荔、醴泉、咸阳、武功等县的情况和临潼差不多。这些县的县委书记告诉我们说，1956年收的粮食一年是吃不完的。例如蒲城县1956年所产的粮食，除了交公粮和完成购粮任务以外，农民平均每口人合一千斤。有不少的社收下的粮食可以吃二、三年。
    粮食增产使农村里起了巨大的变化。在一年前，很多人还在喊叫粮食紧张，粮食零售站的门前整天拥挤着买粮食的人群。现在呢？粮食购销站门前仍然拥挤着人群，但是不是买主而是卖主了。我们访问了几个粮食购销站。在临潼粮食局新丰购销站里，二亩多大的院子里摆满了一袋袋的粮食。这些粮食有的是按出售任务送来的，有的是出售任务以外的余粮。购销站的翟俊逸同志看见我们，就笑着说：“看见了吧！每天都是这样多，一天最少要收六、七万斤粮食。不得了，仓库里都快放不下了！”接着他向我们介绍了这个站的情况。这个站共担负新丰区四个乡的购销任务。1955年这个站售粮的数字是全县最多的，共二百多万斤，从10月就开始售粮，最多的时候一天要接待四百个买主，出售三、四万斤粮食。仓库里一直没有存粮，都是边收购边出售。现在的情况完全变了。1956年原计划收购一百零一万斤，后来又增加了一百零五万斤。现在，收购计划早就完成了，增购计划也快要完成了。1956年县粮食局给这个购销站的出售任务是三十九万多斤，可是直到现在，一斤粮也没有卖出去。据粮站同志的调查，四个乡只需要供应二万二千五百斤就够了。
    因为余粮多，陕西农村的粮食自由市场逐渐兴起来了。临潼县新丰镇每月有九个集，逢集的时候，社员们就背着粮食到这里来出卖，每集交易量在一万斤以上。很多社和社员因为出售不了粮食而发愁。渭南县双王乡和平社现在还存着十万斤玉米，二万斤芽麦。社员已经在自由市场上出售了二万多斤粮食，还要出售五、六万斤。我们在这一带经常碰到农业社的社员用车推着出售的粮食，他们因为粮食售不出去而表示不满。一个农业社员说：我的芽麦并不算坏，可是六分钱一斤就没有人要。粮食部门没有看到这些新的情况。很多地区冬春两季都不需要供应粮食了，他们还制定了庞大的销售粮食的计划。
    由于丰收，农业合作社更加巩固了，高级合作化发展得十分迅速。去年10月份以前，全省入高级社的农户占总农户64％，到了冬季，全省就实现了高级合作化。
    1956年冬季的合作化运动，看起来是不如1955年热闹，没有打锣打鼓的。但是，只要仔细地观察一下，就会发现这个运动的发展是非常健康的。这是因为既有了丰收，又发扬了民主。我们访问了临潼县的斜口乡，这个乡在扩社并社的时候，建社干部采用了群众路线的工作方法，对那些没有入社的农民，都事先进行了调查研究工作和说服教育工作。选举社干部，过去是由党支部提出候选人名单，现在改为先由群众提出候选人名单，经过支部和建社委员会研究以后，交社员群众分组讨论，再由社员大会通过，最后进行选举。对这种做法，社员群众都非常满意。有人说，如果过去用数字来计算成绩，那么，今天还应该添上一条，那就是用广大社员群众的思想觉悟来衡量今天合作化的成绩。在这里，社员群众的思想觉悟表现在什么地方呢？那就是他们爱说的这一句话：入了社以后，就是用八抬大轿也抬不出去了。
    在我们访问过的几个县里，也有一些减少收入的上中农对合作化表示不满，个别的甚至要求退社。但是，并不是所有的上中农都减少了收入。蒲城县委书记告诉我们说，他们调查了几个农业社的上中农的情况，十里铺乡后泉农业社共二百六十五户，增加收入的有二百六十三户，其中有二十户上中农都增加了收入。如上中农雷明新，全家七口人，前年在初级社里共分了三百六十多元，去年共分了七百七十多元。据雷明新自己说，去年收入多的原因是他全家人都积极劳动了，挣的劳动日多。对于这一点，有些本来不相信高级社的优越性、不积极劳动因而减少了收入的上中农，已经认识到了。他们说，“减少收入不亏，明年再见吧！”
    我们在访问以前，曾听到有人说，1956年的冬季生产不如1955年搞的好。这种说法是有一部分道理的。有些地区在秋收后曾一度发生松劲的现象。原因是有些领导人员和基层干部在反对主观主义以后，有束手束脚的现象，没有抓紧领导冬季生产。从群众方面来说，主要是因为劳动了一年了，秋季又获得全面丰收，就想歇一歇，做一些自己的事情。在咸阳县“五一”社里，我们就这问题问过很多社干部，也访问了不少的社员。他们都说，紧张地劳动了一年，自己的事情都放下了，现在丰收了，增加了收入，大家都想趁这个机会修修房子，盖间房子，妇女们都要拆洗和添制全家的棉衣、棉鞋，有些人家还要给姑娘准备嫁妆……。因此，冬季生产不如1956年春季紧张。这种说法是合乎情理的。在其他地方，我们也看到社员分了的粮食还没有存放的地方，大批的玉米还挂在树上，给社员一些时间料理家事是十分必要的。当然也有一种不正常的情况，如醴泉县烽火农业社，全社收的粮食可吃二、三年，于是，有些人对冬季生产就不积极了。他们说，冬天休息一下吧，来年收不好，也挨不了饿。总的说来，放松冬季生产只是少数地区的暂时现象。我们所走过的地方，到处可以看到农业社的社员在进行冬灌、冬耕、送粪等工作。
      从目前的情况看，陕西农村中最大的问题是耕畜缺乏的问题。据农业厅10月底统计，全省减少耕畜一至二万头，而且耕畜普遍瘦弱，最严重的是耕畜繁殖率都非常低。据蒲城县龙阳乡的调查，全乡有繁殖能力的母畜六、七百头，大部分没有配种。产生这种现象的主要原因是社里的活太忙，社员怕母畜配种后影响生产。目前，各级领导已经开始注意解决这些问题。
