Xinhua News Agency, 15th. After cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Chengdu opened free markets under state leadership, the supply of some non-staple foods has improved. In Shanghai's free markets, the arrival volume of live chickens and fresh eggs at its peak accounted for 30% to 50% of the city's total sales. In the first half of the year, only dozens to a hundred jin of live chickens were transported to Shanghai daily by farmers and peddlers; after the opening of free markets in July and August, this increased to one to two thousand jin per day. There were previously very few live fish in Tianjin's vegetable markets, and citizens could only buy dead fish; recently, the market supply of live fish has greatly increased, and fishmongers wrapped fish buckets in cotton quilts to carry them into the vegetable markets to ensure the supply of live fish. The market supply of chickens and ducks in Chengdu has now increased by 150% compared to the past, and egg products have increased by 20%. The market supply of live chickens and fresh fish in Wuhan and Guangzhou has greatly increased compared to before, which citizens are very satisfied with.

The market supply of vegetables, dried and fresh fruits has also increased in various regions. The supply of mung bean sheets and vermicelli in Tianjin was previously strained; after the opening of free markets, farmers from Luan County, Tangshan, and Qufu County in Shandong transported large quantities of vermicelli and mung bean sheets to Tianjin, with a daily market supply of 80,000 to 90,000 jin. According to statistics from Tianjin's dried and fresh fruit stores, the turnover of entrusted buying and selling in November last year was 140,000 yuan, three times higher than the best month of September in the previous year. In Nanjing, after the opening of free markets, over 20 million jin of vegetables were put on the market in November last year, an increase of over 8 million jin compared to October, and an increase of over 4 million jin compared to the same period of the previous year.

Not only has the market supply of chicken, duck, fish, and eggs increased, but also the losses in operation have been greatly reduced. In Nanjing, after the opening of free markets, the losses in the operation of fresh and live goods decreased from 10% to 2%, and for vegetables alone, there was a reduction in losses of over 1.6 million jin. Given the current shortage of cold storage, warehousing, and transportation tools in China, the retail operation of fresh and live goods by farmers and peddlers is far superior to large-scale operation in terms of reducing losses. The development of side occupations by agricultural cooperatives in Jiangsu Province led to a large increase in duck production last year; the previous annual output was several million, and last year it reached over 12 million. The large increase in duck production once greatly worried the state-owned commercial departments, because the state-owned commercial departments had many operational links, and large-scale operation was bound to result in a large number of deaths. However, due to the opening of free markets, farmers have already sold all of these ducks.

After the opening of free markets in various regions, the prices of non-staple foods have slightly increased, and there have also been cases of peddlers deceiving customers by using inferior goods as good goods, which consumers have complained about; a considerable amount of materials subject to state unified purchase and unified procurement have flowed into free markets, affecting the state's procurement tasks; and there have also been instances of tax evasion. According to the experience of various regions, these problems can be solved by strengthening the leadership of the state-owned economy, market management, and education work for farmers and peddlers. After the opening of free markets in Shanghai, Chengdu, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, the prices of chicken, duck, fish, and eggs once rose, but have now fallen.

    各城市开放自由市场后
    鸡鸭鱼蛋等供应情况有了改善
    只要加强国营经济的领导和市场管理，缺点是可以克服的
    新华社15日讯　上海、天津、武汉、广州、成都等城市在开放国家领导下的自由市场以后，部分副食品的供应情况有了改善。上海市自由市场上的毛鸡、鲜蛋到货量，最多的时候曾达到全市销售量的30％到50％。上半年上海市每天由农民、商贩运来的毛鸡仅几十斤到一百多斤；而7、8月间开放自由市场以后，就增加到每天一两万斤。天津市菜场上原来活鱼很少，市民只能买到死鱼；最近活鱼的上市量大大增加，鱼贩为了保证活鱼的供应，用棉被裹着鱼桶挑进菜场。成都市现在鸡鸭的上市量比过去增加了一倍半，蛋品增加了20％。武汉、广州的活鸡、鲜鱼上市量都比以前大为增加，市民感到很满意。
    各地的蔬菜、干鲜果类的上市量也有增加。天津市粉皮粉条的供应情况过去一直紧张，开放自由市场以后，滦县、唐山等地和山东曲阜县的农民，都把粉条、粉皮大量运到天津，每天上市量有八万斤到九万斤。据天津市干鲜果栈的统计，去年11月代客买卖的营业额是十四万元，比前年营业最好的9月份增加了两倍。南京市在开放自由市场以后，去年11月份蔬菜上市两千多万斤，比10月份增加八百多万斤，比前年同期增加了四百多万斤。
    鸡鸭鱼蛋等不但上市量增加了，而且经营中的损耗也大大减少。南京市在开放自由市场以后，鲜活商品经营中的损耗从以前的10％降到2％，仅蔬菜一项，就少损失了一百六十多万斤。在目前我国冷藏、仓储和运输工具不足的情况下，鲜活商品由农民和商贩零挑经营，在减少损耗方面比大批经营优越得多。江苏省农业社发展副业，去年鸭子大量增产，往年产量是几百万只，去年达到了一千二百多万只。鸭子的大量增产，曾经使国营商业部门大为担忧，因为国营商业部门经营环节多，成批经营势必有大量死亡。但是由于自由市场的开放，农民已经把这些鸭子都卖出去了。
    各地自由市场开放后，副食品的价格都略有上涨，也发现有商贩用次货充好货欺骗顾客的行为，消费者有意见；国家统购和统一收购的物资不少流入自由市场，影响了国家的收购任务；同时也发生了漏税逃税等事例。这些问题，据各地的经验，只要加强国营经济的领导、市场的管理和对农民、商贩的教育工作，都是可以解决的。上海、成都、武汉、广州等地开放自由市场以后，鸡鸭鱼蛋的价格曾经一度上涨，现在都已下降。
