    Portable "Relay Tester"
    Zhang Yanhai, a young worker at the Electrical Testing Laboratory of the Nanchang Power Plant, recently created a portable "relay tester."

    The purpose of a relay is to disconnect the protected equipment, send a signal to the maintenance personnel, and automatically bring the standby equipment into operation when a fault or danger occurs in the power generation, power supply, and power consumption systems. To ensure that the relay is sensitive and reliable, regular inspections and tests must be carried out. In the past, there was no complete set of equipment to test various relays. Each time a set of relay protection devices was tested, many scattered test equipment had to be used separately. These scattered equipment alone required at least six people to carry them in two trips, and the test wiring was complicated. The power supply also had to be changed depending on the type of relay, which meant that 80% of the time was spent on preparing for the test.

    The portable "relay tester" successfully developed by Zhang Yanhai is simple, lightweight, and can be carried with you. When testing the relay, as long as a 220-volt single-phase AC power supply is provided, it can meet the required AC and DC power. The operator masters eight selector switches, and the tester can provide various currents and voltages of different sizes. No matter what kind of relay protection device is being tested, only two people can install all the test equipment used, saving the time of replacing equipment wiring and improving the efficiency of inspection and testing by four times.

### 携带式“继电检验器”

    携带式“继电检验器”
    南昌电厂电气试验室青年工人张衍槐在最近制成了一种携带式“继电检验器”。
    继电器的用途是当发电、供电和用电系统中发生故障和危险的时候，断开被保护的设备，给维护人发出信号，并且使备用设备自动加入运行。为了使继电器灵敏可靠，必须进行经常性的各种检查试验。过去没有一套能检验各种继电器的完整设备，每试一组继电保护装置，就需用许多零散试验设备分别进行。光这些零星设备至少要六个人搬运两趟，而且试验接线复杂，电源随着继电器种类不同也要变换，这就使80％的时间用于试验的准备工作。
    张衍槐试制成功的携带式“继电检验器”简单轻便，可以随身携带。试验继电器的时候，只要供给交流单相二百二十伏特的电源，便能满足所需的交流电和直流电。操作人员掌握八只切换开关，检验器就能供给各种大小不一的电流、电压。无论试验任何一种继电保护装置，只要两个人就能把所用的试验设备全部装好，省去了更换设备接线的时间，提高检查试验效率四倍。
