Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The Ministry of Finance has decided that this year's lottery for the redemption of state economic construction bonds will be held in Shanghai on January 20th. This conference will conduct the redemption lottery for the 1954, 1955, and 1956 state economic construction bonds. In addition to sending letters to relevant central authorities requesting them to delegate representatives from relevant departments in Shanghai to attend the meeting for supervision and lottery drawing, the Ministry of Finance has also invited representatives from workers, farmers, and business circles in Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shanghai, and other provinces and cities to attend the meeting for supervision and observation.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The Ministry of Finance issued the "Measures for Principal and Interest Payment of 1956 and 1957 State Economic Construction Bonds" on January 5th. The full text is as follows:

	I. These measures are formulated in accordance with Articles 5, 6, and 7 of the Regulations on the 1956 and 1957 State Economic Construction Bonds.

	II. The principal of the 1956 and 1957 State Economic Construction Bonds shall be repaid in ten installments from 1957 and 1958 to 1966 and 1967 respectively. Except for the final year, when the corresponding amount of principal due will be repaid in full without a lottery, a lottery will be held annually for the redemption of principal. Each lottery will be held before September of each year, and representatives from all sectors will be invited to supervise the process. Bonds with the same last two digits of the bond number as the drawn lottery number will be the winning bonds.

	III. Both types of public bonds shall be handled by the People's Bank of China for the redemption of principal and payment of interest. The winning bond numbers shall be based on the numbers announced by the Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China in each announcement.

	IV. For both types of public bonds, the period for redemption of principal and interest is from September 30th to December 31st of each year within the redemption period, and the local branches of the People's Bank of China shall verify and redeem the bonds. To protect the interests of bondholders, the principal and interest that should have been redeemed but were not collected during the redemption period may be collected during the next redemption period. For those who have not collected the principal and interest for each time, the redemption period will be extended for another 9 months in the final year (i.e., until September 30, 1967, for the 1956 public bonds; and until September 30, 1968, for the 1957 public bonds). If they are not collected by the end of the extended period, the claim will become invalid and will not be redeemed.

	V. For bonds that should have been redeemed each time but the principal is not collected upon maturity, interest shall continue to be paid on the principal at the original interest rate until the time of collection.

	VI. When bondholders go to local branches of the People's Bank of China to collect the interest due, they shall redeem the interest coupons attached to the bonds. However, the entire bond must be submitted to the bank for verification and clipping. Bonds that have been clipped by the bondholder themselves will not be redeemed.

	VII. The redemption of damaged or defaced bonds shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of the "Measures for Handling the Redemption of Damaged or Defaced State Public Bonds."

	VIII. The redemption of principal and interest for both types of public bonds shall be based on the bonds and will not be subject to loss reporting.

	IX. Both types of public bonds are exempt from interest income tax.

	X. These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

    二、1956年和1957年国家经济建设公债本金，分别自1957年和1958年起至1966年和1967年止分十年作十次偿还。除最后一年对应还本金数额不举行抽签全部偿还外，其余均按年抽签还本一次。每次抽签，于每年的9月以前举行，邀请各界代表到场监督，以债券号码末尾两字与抽出签枝的号码相同的为中签债券。
    三、两种公债，都由中国人民银行办理还本和付息事宜。中签债券一律以中华人民共和国财政部每次通告的中签债券号码为准。
