Digging Rice Roots, Hoeing Grain Stubble, Turning Over Hardened Fields
Various Regions Actively Eliminate Overwintering Pests

    This newspaper reports: Spring plowing is approaching, and various regions are currently actively carrying out winter pest control work. Most southern rice-producing provinces have been conducting winter rice borer control. Hunan Province has trained more than 2,000 rice borer control cadres, and most counties and districts have established rice borer control organizations. As of the end of last year, the province had turned over more than 14.4 million mu of hardened fields, accounting for 62% of the fields that should be turned over. Qianyang Special District, which is progressing faster, has completed more than 80%, and some counties have also flooded their fields for the winter. Hubei Province, despite the severe drought, still has five special districts that have carried out winter pest control work in conjunction with fertilizer accumulation. Tianmen County has dug up more than 1.5 million jin of rice roots, and Jingshan County has dug 75 large cellars to bury rice roots for composting. Jiangxi Province, in conjunction with water conservancy construction, has formed a high tide of winter plowing to eliminate insects, and many agricultural cooperatives are braving the rain to pull up rice roots.
    Northern corn, millet, and sorghum producing areas have carried out the work of eliminating overwintering Asiatic rice borers. Yushe County, Shanxi Province, hoed and burned more than 100,000 mu of grain stubble, eliminating an estimated 200 million Asiatic rice borers. The work of preventing and controlling overwintering pink bollworms in cotton-producing areas has been carried out on a wider scale and more thoroughly than in previous years. Liaoning Province has widely promoted cold storage, freezing to death all the pink bollworms hiding in seed cotton and cottonseeds; some areas have also used methyl bromide to fumigate cottonseeds. Currently, many cotton-producing areas are preparing to combine the Spring Festival custom of mass cleaning to carry out a comprehensive sweeping, plastering, and blocking campaign to seal off the old nests of pink bollworms. Fruit tree areas in southern Liaoning and eastern Shandong have generally cleaned orchards and applied white wash. Some orchards have also been plowed.
    Due to suitable natural conditions last year, some areas changed their cropping systems and increased the planting of high-yield crops. Many diseases and insects occurred in greater numbers than in previous years, and overwintering densities were high. According to a survey in Luxian County, Sichuan Province, the insect rate in the rice roots of middle and late rice fields was six times higher than in 1955; in Xiangtang District, Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, there were more than 80,000 rice borers per mu of rice roots; and in Changzhi area, Shanxi Province, the overwintering corn borer density was seven times higher than in 1955. Currently, winter pest control work has not yet been carried out in many areas. All regions should seize typical examples to publicize and mobilize the masses and carry out winter pest control work.

### 挖稻根、刨谷茬、翻耕板田  各地积极消灭过冬害虫

    挖稻根、刨谷茬、翻耕板田
    各地积极消灭过冬害虫
    本报讯　春耕即将到来，目前各地正积极开展冬季治虫工作。南方稻区大部省份进行了冬季治螟，湖南省训练了二千多名治螟干部，大部县、区建立起治螟组织，截至去年年底，全省已翻耕板田一千四百余万亩，占应翻板田的62％，进度较快的黔阳专区已完成80％以上，还有一些县份灌了冬水。湖北省在严重干旱情况下仍有五个专区结合积肥开展了冬季治虫工作，天门县已挖掘稻根一百五十余万斤，京山县挖了七十五个大窖压埋稻根沤肥。江西省结合兴修水利，冬耕灭虫已形成高潮，有不少农业社冒着雨拔稻根。
    北方玉米、谷子、高粱产区开展了消灭过冬杂谷螟虫工作。山西省榆社县就刨烧谷茬十余万亩，约计消灭杂谷螟虫二亿条。棉区防治过冬红铃虫工作比往年开展范围广，处理比较彻底。辽宁省广泛推行冷室贮藏，把躲在籽棉及棉籽里的红铃虫全部冻死；还有些地区使用溴代甲烷熏蒸棉籽。目前不少棉区正准备结合春节群众大扫除的习惯，开展全面扫、糊、堵运动，封闭红铃虫的老窝。辽宁南部、山东东部果树地区普遍进行了清扫果园，抹刷白涂剂。有的果园还进行了翻耕。
    由于去年自然条件适宜，一部分地区改变耕作制度，增种高产作物，许多病、虫发生数量比往年多，越冬密度大。据四川省泸县调查中、晚稻田的稻根有虫率比1955年多六倍；江西省南昌县向塘区每亩稻根有螟虫八万多条；山西省长治地区过冬玉米螟密度竟比1955年多七倍。目前还有不少地区冬季治虫工作尚未进行，各地应抓紧典型实例向群众宣传动员，把冬季治虫工作开展起来。　（王炳章）
