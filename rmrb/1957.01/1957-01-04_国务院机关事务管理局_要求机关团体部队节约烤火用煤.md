Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd: The State Council机关事务管理局 (General Office Administration Bureau) , in light of the current situation where the supply of coal for winter use cannot meet demand, requests that all 机关 (government offices), 团体 (organizations), 党派 (parties) , and 部队 (military units) conserve coal for heating, so that the state can allocate some coal to supply urban and rural people.

The State Council机关事务管理局 today invited relevant personnel from central-level institutions of central 机关, various democratic parties, mass organizations, and the General Staff Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to a meeting to arrange for the work of conserving coal for heating. The person in charge of the Fuel Allocation Bureau of the State Economic Commission reported on the production and supply of coal. He said that to solve the current problem of coal supply falling short of demand, there are only two solutions: increasing production and conserving. To increase production, it is necessary to invest in the construction of new coal mines, but this will not be effective in the short term. Currently, we should focus more on conservation. He said that it is now necessary to reduce some coal for heating in 机关 and a small amount of industrial coal, and allocate some coal to supply residents.

The person in charge of the State Council机关事务管理局 requested that all 机关, 团体, and 部队 conscientiously implement the instructions on conserving coal for heating to be issued by the State Council, and reduce coal consumption for heating by 15% to 20%.

    要求机关团体部队节约烤火用煤
    新华社3日讯　国务院机关事务管理局根据目前冬季用煤供不应求的情况，要求各机关、团体、党派、部队节约烤火用煤，以便国家能够调剂一部分煤炭出来供应城乡人民。
    国务院机关事务管理局今天邀请中央各机关、各民主党派和群众团体的中央一级机构以及中国人民解放军总参谋部的有关人员开会布置节约烤火用煤的工作。国家经济委员会燃料分配局负责人在会上报告煤炭的生产和供应情况。他说，要解决目前煤炭供不应求的问题，只有增产和节约两条办法，要增加生产，就要投资建设新煤矿，但这不是短时期内就能见效的，目前应该多从节约着眼。他说，现在要削减一部分机关烤火用煤和少量工业用煤，调剂一部分煤炭出来供应居民。
    国务院机关事务管理局负责人，要求各机关、团体、部队认真贯彻国务院即将发出的节约烤火用煤的指示，降低烤火用煤15％到20％。
