Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, January 9th. The delegation of the National People's Congress of China and the delegation of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee arrived in Plovdiv, Bulgaria's second largest city, by car on the morning of the 7th.

The delegation was warmly welcomed by more than 70,000 citizens in the city center square. The welcoming people held up signs with "Long Live Sino-Bulgarian Friendship!" and "Long Live the Solidarity of Socialist Countries Headed by the Soviet Union!" cheering and greeting the guests, and presented them with local specialties such as rose oil.

Balkandzhiev, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Plovdiv City People's Council, said at the welcoming ceremony that great China is in the distant East where the sun rises. Whenever the rising sun shines on us in the morning, we think of China, which shines like a huge sun in the world. He said that the Bulgarian people's love and admiration for the great fraternal Chinese people is immense and boundless.

Then, Delegation Leader Peng Zhen spoke, conveying to the enthusiastically cheering citizens the profound friendship of the 600 million Chinese people to the Bulgarian people.

Afterwards, Deputy Delegation Leader Li Jishen spoke. He said that there has always been a deep friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people. After our respective countries were liberated and reborn, this friendship has rapidly developed and been consolidated due to our shared commitment to socialist construction. Li Jishen said that the imperialists are doing everything possible to stir up a tide of anti-communism, anti-people, and anti-peace. In order to accelerate the socialist construction of our countries, to effectively defend peace, and to support the progressive cause of mankind, all of our socialist countries must cherish the friendship between our fraternal countries and consolidate and strengthen the international solidarity of the proletariat headed by the Soviet Union.

In the afternoon of the same day, the delegation visited the Belushmotsa Agricultural Production Cooperative, the Maritsa United Textile Factory, the Kolarov Agricultural College, the Handicraft Production Cooperative, and municipal organs.

When the delegation passed through Basadjik City before arriving in Plovdiv City, more than 5,000 citizens lined the streets to welcome the delegation. Young girls presented baskets of bright red apples and famous wines to the Chinese guests.
