Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, January 27th: Two veteran workers, Li Lunqian and Liu Zhiqing, who actively participated in the "February 7th" revolutionary struggle thirty-four years ago, have now become models on the front of increasing production and practicing economy in socialist construction.

　　Li Lunqian, a veteran worker who was a member of the picket during the "February 7th" struggle, was originally a locomotive fireman. After his leg was injured while repairing a locomotive, he was transferred to the boiler room of the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot factory. Ordinarily, burning the tea stove would require 200 kilograms of bituminous coal per day, and the factory had explicitly stipulated that this amount could be used; however, Li Lunqian tried every means to save coal. Every day, he would search through the large amount of slag thrown out from the locomotives or repair shops, repeatedly looking for unburned coal, and mix this coal with good bituminous coal for burning. In this way, he only needed 30 to 50 kilograms of good bituminous coal per day. Because of his careful calculation and love for state property, he was rated as a first-class model worker in the entire factory at the end of last year. Li Lunqian also often personally delivered the boiled water to various workshops and offices, so that employees would not delay their work by running back and forth.

　　Liu Zhiqing, a "February 7th" veteran worker who has worked as a boilermaker on the railway for more than forty years, is already sixty-four years old this year. Two years ago, the pipe group of the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot factory produced defective products almost every day, resulting in serious rework and waste. After Liu Zhiqing was transferred from the boiler group to the pipe group, he actively led the apprentices to find the key points, investigate the causes, and improve operating skills, and the defect rate quickly decreased. In the past two or three months, none of the pipes repaired by the entire group have been defective. In the past, the workshop and its surroundings were littered with waste pipes, iron plates, and scrap materials, which made Liu Zhiqing feel sad. On the one hand, he took advantage of his spare time to pick them up and reuse them, and on the other hand, he resolutely made suggestions to the leadership. Under his impetus, the young people in the factory formed a youth economy team and established a special scrap box for collecting waste steel. Now, the phenomenon of waste materials lying all over the ground is no longer visible.

    两个“二七”老工人成了增产节约的模范人物
    据新华社郑州27日电　三十四年前积极参加“二七”革命斗争的老工人李伦谦，刘志清，今天在社会主义建设中又成了增产节约战线上的模范人物。
    “二七”斗争中当过纠察团团员的老工人李伦谦，原来是机车司炉，因为修理机车碰坏了腿，被调到郑州机务段工厂烧茶炉。一般人烧茶炉每天要用烟煤两百公斤，厂里也明文规定可以用这么多；但是李伦谦想尽办法节约用煤。他每天都从机车或修理房抛出的大量炉渣里，翻来复去地寻找没有烧透的煤炭，用这些煤炭同好烟煤掺和着烧。这样，一天只用好烟煤三十公斤到五十公斤就行了。因为他精打细算爱护国家财产，去年年底被评为全厂的一等模范。李伦谦还常常把烧好的开水亲自送到各个车间和办公室，免得职工们来回跑路耽误工作。
    在铁路上干过四十多年锅炉工的“二七”老工人刘志清，今年已经六十四岁了。两年前，郑州机务段工厂的管子组几乎天天都要出废品，返工浪费严重。刘志清从锅炉组调到管子组以后，便积极领导徒工找关键，查原因，提高操作技术，废品率很快就下降了。最近两三个月全组检修的管子，竟没有一根是废品。过去车间内外丢满了废管子、铁板块和碎料，刘志清见了就难过。他一面趁空拣起来加以利用，一面坚决向领导方面提意见。在他的带动下，全厂青年们成立青年节约队，并且专门设立收集废钢铁的废料箱，目前已经看不到废料满地的现象了。
