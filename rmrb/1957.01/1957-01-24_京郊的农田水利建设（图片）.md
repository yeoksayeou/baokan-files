    Farmland Irrigation Construction in the Suburbs of Beijing
    Since the beginning of winter, many agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing have actively carried out farmland irrigation construction. Changping District plans to open two irrigation canals (which, when completed, can irrigate 10,000 mu of land) and plans to sink 155 artesian wells. This is a picture of members of the Tingzizhuang Township Agricultural Cooperative in Changping District busily sinking wells.

    京郊的农田水利建设
    入冬以来，北京市郊区许多乡农业社积极进行农田水利建设。昌平区计划开两条灌溉渠（开成后能浇地一万亩），并计划打自流井一百五十五眼。这是昌平区亭自庄乡农业社的社员们正在紧张地打井。
