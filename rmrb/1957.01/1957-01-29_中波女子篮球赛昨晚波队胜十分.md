    Sino-Polish Women's Basketball Game: Polish Team Wins by Ten Points Last Night

    (Our dispatch) The Polish National Women's Basketball Team defeated the joint team of the Beijing team and the "August 1st" team by a score of 80-70 last night at the Beijing Gymnasium. This result gave the Polish team a record of eight wins in eight games in Beijing, Chongqing, Wuhan, and other places.

    The Polish team displayed good and comprehensive fundamental skills in this game. They made very few mistakes in passing, receiving, shooting, and faking to dribble past opponents, and were particularly good at mid-range shooting. Captain Olesewicz scored 28 points alone by combining accurate mid-range shooting with deceptive movements.

    The joint team played relatively chaotically in this game. In attack, they lacked accurate mid-range shooting and a center who posed a significant threat under the opponent's basket. In defense, they failed to effectively contain the Polish team's main scorers. In the first two quarters, the team's basket was like an "uninhabited zone" for the opponent, so they were at a disadvantage from the start. In addition, the poor free throw percentage (only 24 out of 44 free throws made) caused the team to lag behind by 22 points (67-45) at the end of the third quarter.

    In the last three minutes, the joint team played better. Hu Yingxin and Zhou Yixian scored many points through shooting and free throws, but unfortunately, due to too many fouls by the players, key players such as Xu Min and Zhou Zhengyun were fouled out of the game with five fouls. The Polish team scored many points simply by making free throws.

    After the game, amidst applause from the audience, Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping shook hands with and comforted the players of both teams, and took pictures together.

    中波女子篮球赛昨晚波队胜十分
    本报讯　波兰国家女子篮球队昨晚在北京体育馆内以八十比七十胜北京队和“八一”队混合组成的联队，这场比赛的结果，使波兰队获得了在北京、重庆、武汉等地八战八胜的成绩。
    波兰队在这场比赛中表现了良好和全面的基本动作，她们在传球、接球、投篮和假动作过人中都很少有错误，尤其擅长于中距离投篮。队长奥列塞维茨利用准确的中距离投篮结合虚晃过人，一个人便得了二十八分。
    联队在这场比赛中打得比较混乱，进攻时缺少准确的中距离投篮和给对方篮下有很大威胁的中锋，在防守时又未能很好地钳制住波兰队的得分主力，前两节在自己的篮下被对方如入“无人之境”，因此一开始便一直占下风，再加上罚球不准（罚四十四次，仅命中二十四次），在第三节结束时曾落后二十二分（六十七比四十五）。
    最后三分钟中，联队打得较有起色，胡英信、周懿娴连投带罚扳回了不少球，可惜因为队员犯规过多，主力队员许敏、周正云等都五次犯规被罚出场。波兰队单凭罚球便得了不少分。
    比赛完毕后，在观众的一片掌声中，刘少奇委员长、邓小平副总理和两队队员一一握手慰劳，并在一起照了像。
