Title: Collective Leadership Doesn't Mean More Meetings

Meeting frequency was already an old problem, and now this old problem has become very serious. A certain engineering company in Jilin City scheduled twenty meetings in one month, each requiring the manager and the Party Secretary to attend. A Party Secretary in Changchun City attended four meetings in one day. He said, "Now everyone looks for me for everything, as if seeking me shows respect for the Party Committee." The meeting situation in the grassroots organizations of industrial and mining enterprises is even more extreme. Some branch secretaries in the Liaoyuan Coal Mine have tallied that they attend a minimum of forty meetings and a maximum of fifty meetings each month.

Why are there so many meetings? Some people say this is the result of implementing collective leadership. Actually, the problem doesn't lie here. In implementing collective leadership, meetings are only for discussing and deciding on major issues in the enterprise, not every single issue.

However, some people want to push all issues, big and small, to the Party Committee for discussion. An administrative leader in a certain enterprise in Changchun City demanded that the Party Committee discuss all the issues he raised, saying, "If the Party Committee doesn't discuss them, you'll be responsible if something goes wrong in the future!" They are afraid of taking responsibility, thinking that if the Party Committee discusses it, they won't bear any personal responsibility even if problems arise in the future. This view clearly distorts the system of collective leadership with individual responsibility. Because implementing collective leadership does not reduce individual responsibility, but rather strengthens the individual's sense of responsibility towards the Party's cause. If individuals are not responsible, how can collective leadership be realized?

Some Party Secretaries also believe that only when the Party Committee discusses everything can the Party's leadership be realized. They want to take over all the affairs of the administrative side, leaving the administrative leaders constrained and afraid to take responsibility. The administrative leader of the Yingchengzi Coal Mine purchased a set of dispatch console telephone equipment for work needs, but later could not get reimbursement. It is said that the main reason was that the Party Committee had not yet held a meeting to discuss it. A certain Bureau Director in Tonghua City approved the making of several stools, but the Party Secretary felt that it had not been studied by the Party Committee and would not allow them to be made. As a result, these administrative leaders sought the Party Committee for research and discussion for everything they wanted to do, causing the Party Committee to fall into a circle of affairs. This is a very abnormal phenomenon. The Party Committee's leadership should be political, ideological, and policy-oriented, and it should never take over administrative management work. Taking over not only weakens the sense of responsibility of enterprise administrative management personnel, but also relaxes the Party's political and ideological work.

Some Party organizations also believe that "more meetings and more discussions can reduce mistakes." This saying is very common. Holding meetings for discussion and collective research can certainly reduce mistakes. However, if all matters, regardless of their size, are discussed in meetings, then it may not necessarily reduce mistakes. Because factories have many things to do, if everything has to be discussed in meetings, then everyone will not be able to go deep into the masses to understand the situation, so how can they guarantee to reduce mistakes?

Of course, some comrades, due to lack of experience in the initial implementation of the system of collective leadership with individual responsibility, may not be able to distinguish which issues need to be discussed in meetings, and it is inevitable that they will hold some unnecessary meetings. This requires slowly exploring, finding experience, and gradually distinguishing which issues need to be discussed and which do not. However, if the system of collective leadership with individual responsibility is distorted, believing that discussing everything in meetings is collective leadership, then experience will never be found, and the system of collective leadership with individual responsibility will never be well implemented.

### 集体领导不是要多开会

    集体领导不是要多开会
    陈迹
    会议多，本来是个老问题，现在这个老问题又变得十分严重了。吉林市有个工程公司一个月内就排了二十次会议，每次会议都要经理和党委书记参加。长春市有位党委书记一天参加了四次会议。他说：“现在什么事情都要找我，找了我好像才算尊重党委。”至于工矿企业的基层组织的会议就更多了。辽源煤矿有些支部书记作了统计，他们每月最少要参加四十次会议，最多要参加五十次会议。
    为什么有这么多的会议呢？有人说这是实行集体领导的结果。其实，问题不在这里。实行集体领导，召开会议只是讨论和决定企业中的重大问题，而不是所有的问题。
    可是，有些人想把大大小小的问题，都推给党委去讨论。长春市有位企业行政领导人员要求党委讨论他所提出的一切问题，他说：“如果党委不讨论，将来出了事，你们负责呵！”他们害怕负责任，以为党委讨论了，将来即使出了问题，个人就不负什么责任了。这种看法，显然歪曲了集体领导分工负责制度。因为实行集体领导，不是削减个人的责任心，而是加强个人对党的事业的责任感。假若个人不负责任，又怎么能实现集体领导呢？
    有些党委书记也认为什么事情都要党委讨论，才算实现了党的领导。他们想包办代替行政方面的一切事务，弄得行政负责人束手束脚，不敢负责。营城子煤矿的行政负责人因为工作需要，购买了一套调度台的电话设备，后来却不能报销。据说，主要原因是党委还没有开会讨论。通化市有位局长批准做几个凳子，党委书记觉得没有经过党委研究，就不让做。这样做的结果，这些行政负责人要干什么事，都找党委研究、讨论，使得党委掉进了事务圈子里。这是很不正常的现象。党委的领导，应该是政治上、思想上和政策上的领导，决不是包办代替行政管理工作。包办代替，不但会削弱企业行政管理人员的责任心，而且也会放松党的政治思想工作。
    也有些党组织以为“多开会、多讨论，可以少犯错误，”这种说法很普遍。开会讨论，集体研究，固然能够少犯错误。但是如果不区别事情的大小，都一律开会讨论，那么未必就能少犯错误。因为工厂事情很多，什么都要开会讨论，弄得大家不能深入群众，了解下情，这怎么能保证少犯错误呢？
    当然也有一些同志因为缺少经验，在实行集体领导分工负责制度的初期，分不清哪些问题需要开会讨论，也难免多召开了一些不必要的会议。这需要慢慢摸索，找出经验，逐步分清哪些问题需要讨论，哪些问题不需要讨论。但是，如果歪曲了集体领导分工负责制度，以为什么问题都开会讨论才算是集体领导，那末永远也摸索不出经验来，永远也贯彻不好集体领导分工负责制度。
