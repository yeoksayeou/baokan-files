Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th: The five sugar refineries under the Guangdong Provincial State-Owned Sugar Industry Company – Shunde, Dongguan, Zini, Shitou, and Jieyang – accumulated more than 99 million yuan in funds for the state in 1956.

These five sugar refineries mainly increased fund accumulation by improving equipment utilization rates, reducing sugar loss during production, and lowering costs. In the first half of 1956, due to the creation and promotion of various advanced operating methods, the five factories were able to squeeze an average of more than 2,400 tons of sugarcane per day more than their designed capacity, thus producing more than 5,600 tons of white granulated sugar compared to the same period in 1955. In the first half of last year, the five factories also produced an additional 1.08 million yuan worth of white granulated sugar by reducing sugar loss during production. Employees also paid attention to saving in other aspects. For example, bagasse, which is used as fuel for sugar factories, used to be left to rot if it couldn't be burned. In 1956, the factories sold the remaining bagasse to paper mills and farmers, which not only made use of this bagasse but also provided the sugar factories with some income. Due to the general attention to saving by employees, the five factories reduced costs by about 2 million yuan in 1956, exceeding the state-mandated cost reduction target of 4.4%.

However, in the first half of 1956, these five factories also incurred a loss of more than 720,000 yuan due to the production of more than 6,000 tons of substandard brown sugar. The factories learned from this lesson, and after the start of the new pressing season in November, they strengthened technical management, and the quality of the products has improved.

This newspaper reports that the Xianghongdian Reservoir and Mozitan Reservoir projects, which are under construction in Anhui Province, can save the state 6 million yuan in funds after re-examining the budget and accepting rationalization proposals from employees. The budget for the Xianghongdian Reservoir project, after being reviewed by the Ministry of Water Resources, the Huai River Commission Survey and Design Institute, the Xianghongdian Reservoir Project Headquarters, and other units, reduced expenditures by more than 4 million yuan. For example, the original budget required drilling holes in the concrete, costing 30 yuan per meter. During the budget review, construction technology was studied, and it was determined that as long as pipes were embedded when pouring the concrete, it would not be necessary to drill holes, thus saving 15 yuan in construction costs per meter. By the end of last year, the materials saved by employees in the construction of the Mozitan Reservoir that could be valued amounted to more than 1.98 million yuan. The employees of this reservoir put forward more than 400 rationalization proposals of significant value, and 40% of them have been adopted. The two reservoirs have also saved a lot of equipment investment and living expenses. For example, the Xianghongdian Reservoir originally planned to purchase eleven cars, but after review, eight were cut. The employees of the Mozitan Reservoir used mountain-grown "Bawang" grass and miscellaneous trees as straw and bamboo to build more than 600 houses, saving more than 50,000 yuan in materials alone.

### 积累资金　节约资金  广东五大糖厂去年积累资金近亿元  安徽两个水库今年压缩投资六百万

    积累资金　节约资金
    广东五大糖厂去年积累资金近亿元
    安徽两个水库今年压缩投资六百万
    新华社广州8日电　国营广东制糖工业公司所属顺德、东莞、紫坭、市头、揭阳五个糖厂，1956年为国家积累了九千九百多万元资金。
    这五个糖厂主要是靠提高设备利用率，减少生产过程中的糖分流失，降低成本等办法来增加资金积累的。1956年上半年，由于创造和推广了各项先进操作法，五个厂平均每天要比设计能力多榨二千四百多吨甘蔗，因而比1955年同期增产了五千六百多吨白砂糖。去年上半年五个厂由于在生产过程中减少糖分流失也多生产了价值一百零八万多元的白砂糖。职工们还注意从其他方面节约。例如作为糖厂燃料的蔗渣，过去烧不完就白白让它烂掉，1956年各厂把剩余的蔗渣卖给造纸厂和农民，既使这些蔗渣得到利用，糖厂本身也得到一部分收入。由于职工们普遍注意节约，1956年五个厂共降低成本两百万元左右，超过国家规定降低成本4.4％的指标。
    但是，这五个厂在1956年上半年也曾经因为生产了六千多吨次质赤砂糖，损失了七十二万余元资金。各厂吸取了这个教训，在11月份新榨季开始以后，都加强了技术管理，产品质量已经有了提高。
    本报讯　在安徽省正在建设中的响洪甸水库和磨子潭水库工程，经过重新审查预算和职工提合理化建议以后，可以为国家节约资金六百万元。响洪甸水库工程的预算，经中央水利部、淮委勘测设计院、响洪甸水库工程指挥部等单位审查后，削减可以俭省的费用达四百多万元。如原预算中，要在混凝土上钻孔，每公尺需三十元，审查预算时，研究了施工技术，认为只要在浇灌混凝土时埋好管子，就不必钻孔，这样每公尺就可节省工程费用十五元。磨子潭水库到去年底，职工们在施工中节约的材料能计算出价值的，已达一百九十八万多元。这个水库的职工们提出了有重大价值的合理化建议四百多件，有40％已被采用。两个水库还节约了许多设备投资和生活费用。如响洪甸水库，原来还计划自己购买十一辆汽车，经过审查，削减掉八辆。磨子潭水库的职工用山上长的巴王草和杂树作稻草和毛竹盖了六百多间房子，光材料一项就节约了五万多元。　（安徽记者站）
