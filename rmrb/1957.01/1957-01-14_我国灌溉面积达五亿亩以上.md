According to a reporter from the Central People's Broadcasting Station at the National Water Conservancy Conference being held in Beijing: To date, China's total irrigated area has reached over 500 million mu, accounting for approximately 30% of the nation's existing cultivated land, an increase of 70% compared to before liberation. China has now become the country with the largest irrigated area in the world.

The large-scale water conservancy construction movement launched in the high tide of agricultural cooperation in 1956 has brought unprecedented achievements to China's farmland water conservancy work. Last year, the expanded irrigated area across the country exceeded the irrigated area stipulated to be expanded in the First Five-Year Plan by more than double. The majority of small reservoirs, ponds, and dams and other farmland water conservancy projects built in the southern provinces last year withstood the test of floods and also played a significant role in the fight against drought. As a result of large-scale well-digging in North China, the newly developed irrigated area last year expanded by one and a half times the original irrigated area. In 1956, China achieved great success in agricultural production despite fairly severe water and drought disasters, which is closely related to the achievements in water conservancy construction.

    我国灌溉面积达五亿亩以上
    本报讯　据中央人民广播电台记者从正在北京举行的全国水利会议上获悉：到目前为止，我国的灌溉总面积已经达到五亿亩以上，占全国现有耕地面积大约30％，比解放以前增加了70％。目前我国已经成为全世界灌溉面积最大的一个国家了。
    1956年在农业合作化高潮中展开的大规模的兴修水利运动，使我国的农田水利工作获得空前巨大的成就。去年全国扩大的灌溉面积超过第一个五年计划规定要扩大的灌溉面积一倍以上。去年南方各省所修的小型水库和塘坝等农田水利工程，绝大部分都经受了洪水考验，在抗旱斗争中也起了显著的作用。华北地区大规模打井的结果，去年新发展的灌溉面积比原有灌溉面积扩大了一倍半。1956年，我国在水旱灾害相当严重的情况下，农业生产还取得了巨大的成绩，同水利建设的成就有很密切的关系。
