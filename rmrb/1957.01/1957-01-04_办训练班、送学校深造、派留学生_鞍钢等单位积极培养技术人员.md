    Running Training Classes, Sending Students to Advanced Schools, Dispatching Students Abroad
    Angang and Other Units Actively Cultivate Technical Personnel
    According to Xinhua News Agency, in 1956, 449 technicians from Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Angang) were promoted to engineers after training, and more than 20,000 skilled workers were upgraded.
    In that year, Angang established various professional training classes suitable for section chiefs, foreman, and engineering technical personnel, and sent more than 3,580 cadres and workers to secondary technical schools and spare-time universities for further study.
    In 1956, in addition to equipping more than a dozen factories and mines, such as the newly built and expanded No. 2 Steel Plant, Donganshan Iron Mine, Dagushan Iron Mine, and Xin Shaoshao Factory, with a large number of technical management cadres and skilled workers, Angang also transferred more than 500 cadres and skilled workers to support the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise and Baotou Iron and Steel United Enterprise, which were under construction.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 2nd: The Xi'an Power Capacitor Factory is training production technicians needed after it goes into production. At present, in addition to a group of engineering technical personnel who have been sent to the Soviet Union for production practice, most have been assigned to more than a dozen factories in Shanghai, Shenyang, Xiangtan, and Xi'an for study. In addition to learning electrical engineering technology, they must also learn grinding, electroplating, electric welding and gas welding, painting, instrumentation and other process skills. These personnel will return to the factory before the factory goes into production. Another group of production personnel are being trained in schools.
    The staff who have already arrived at the factory are now concentrating on studying science, business, culture, and Russian. Cadres above the section level in this factory have already had the responsible engineer explain to them in layman's terms the production situation of the power capacitor factory so that they have a preliminary understanding of production operations.
    Manufacturing power capacitors is an emerging industry in China, with complex types of work and precise technical requirements, and China has not had specialized personnel in this area in the past.

    办训练班、送学校深造、派留学生
    鞍钢等单位积极培养技术人员
    据新华社讯　鞍山钢铁公司1956年有四百四十九名技术员经过培养以后，被提升为工程师，有两万多名技术工人晋了级。
    在这一年里，鞍钢开办了适合科长、工段长、工程技术人员学习的各类专业学习班，输送了三千五百八十多名干部和工人到中等技术学校和业余大学去学习。
    1956年，鞍钢除了给新建和扩建的第二炼钢厂、东鞍山铁矿、大孤山铁矿、新烧结厂等十多个厂矿配备了大批技术管理干部和技术工人以外，还抽调出五百多名干部、技术工人支援了正在建设中的武汉钢铁联合企业和包头钢铁联合企业。
    据新华社西安2日电　西安电力电容器厂正在培养训练投入生产后需用的生产技术人员。目前，除了一部分工程技术人员已经被派到苏联进行生产实习以外，大部分是分派到上海、沈阳、湘潭和西安等地十几个工厂进行学习的。他们除了要学会电工技术以外，还要学习磨工、电镀工、电焊和气焊工、喷漆工、仪表工等工艺技能。这些人员将在这个工厂投入生产前回到厂里。还有一批生产人员正在学校里培养中。
    已经来到这个厂的工作人员，目前正在集中力量学习科学、业务、文化和俄文。这个厂里科级以上的干部，已经由负责工程师向他们通俗地讲解了电力电容器厂的生产情况，使他们对生产业务有初步的了解。
    制造电力电容器在我国是一种新兴的工业，工种复杂，技术要求精密，而我国过去并没有这方面的专门人材。
