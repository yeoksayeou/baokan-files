Tianjin Studies Strengthening Ideological Education in Middle Schools
On the basis of all-round development, students should correctly understand the relationship between the collective and the individual, discipline and freedom, and democracy and centralism.
    (This report) Tianjin, January 10th (By our staff reporter)—The Education Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a symposium on secondary school education work from December 24th of last year to January 8th of this year. The meeting studied the existing problems in the city's secondary schools and improvement methods. The participants unanimously agreed that in the future, all secondary schools must further correctly implement the education policy of all-round development and vigorously strengthen political and ideological education for students.
    Since the city's education sector launched a discussion on educational policy last summer, the thinking of many school teachers and students has become significantly more active, and the learning enthusiasm of general students has also greatly improved; however, phenomena such as freedom, laxity, and non-compliance with discipline have also emerged among many students. The meeting believed that these shortcomings are shortcomings in progress, and at the same time, serious attention must be paid to the new problems that have emerged in the work.
    The meeting believed that one of the important gains of the discussion of the educational policy was that everyone had a further understanding of the policy itself, and that certain subjective shortcomings that deviated from reality in education and teaching work were criticized. Many schools have also corrected practices such as excessively demanding uniformity from students and imposing too many restrictions. After this discussion, everyone also clarified that in the future, in educational methods, attention must be paid to understanding and studying the personality characteristics and age characteristics of students, and to conducting education separately according to the objects, in order to better implement the educational policy of all-round development. However, practical experience in the most recent period has proven that cultivating and developing students' individuality and strengths must be based on all-round development, and at the same time, students must have a unified understanding of the relationship between the collective and the individual, discipline and freedom, and democracy and centralism. Only in this way can the correct implementation of the education policy be guaranteed.
    In order to consolidate achievements and further overcome shortcomings, the participants unanimously agreed that all secondary schools and teachers must actively strengthen leadership, give play to their initiative, improve and enhance education and teaching work, and at the same time, vigorously strengthen political and ideological education for students. The meeting pointed out that many schools still have the shortcoming of education and teaching work being somewhat disconnected from each other. Some teachers only pay attention to classroom teaching, but are not concerned enough about students' thoughts and lives. At the same time, some schools lack leadership in class teacher work, and some schools only have a few teachers or League cadres responsible for the political and ideological education of students. These shortcomings should be overcome.
    The meeting proposed that conducting political and ideological education for students is the glorious responsibility of every teacher. It is required that teachers pay more attention to conducting political and ideological education for students through classroom teaching, so that education and teaching work are closely integrated. It is also necessary to strengthen ideological education for students through extracurricular life.
    In terms of the content of political and ideological education, the meeting put forward the following requirements: First, strengthen students' socialist education and hard work and plain living education, so that students understand the glorious future of socialism and the arduousness of construction work, and encourage students to study actively. Second, strengthen students' education in patriotism and internationalism. Third, strengthen education in class viewpoint and labor viewpoint. Fourth, strengthen collectivism education. Fifth, strive to cultivate students' communist moral character.
    At the meeting, leading cadres of various schools also exchanged some work experiences. City No. 1 Middle School, No. 3 Middle School, No. 18 Middle School and other schools also put forward some specific measures to improve the current school education work; some schools also suggested that the Municipal Education Bureau and the Municipal Communist Youth League Committee strengthen the leadership of students' political and ideological education work. Finally, Liang Hanbing, Minister of the Education Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a concluding speech.

    天津研究加强中学思想教育
    在全面发展的基础上，使学生正确理解集体同个人、纪律同自由、民主同集中的关系。
    本报讯　中共天津市委教育工作部于去年12月24日至今年1月8日召开了中等学校教育工作座谈会。会上研究了目前全市中等学校存在的问题及改进办法。与会者一致认为今后各中等学校必须进一步正确地贯彻全面发展的教育方针，大力加强对学生的政治思想教育工作。
    自从去年暑期本市教育界展开关于教育方针的讨论以来，许多学校教师和学生的思想显著活跃了，一般学生的学习积极性也大大提高了；但是在不少学生中也出现了自由散漫、不遵守纪律等现象。会议认为，这些缺点是前进中的缺点，同时对工作中出现的新问题也必须引起严重注意。
    会议认为讨论教育方针的重要收获之一，是大家对方针本身有了进一步的了解，使教育和教学工作中的某些脱离实际的主观主义缺点受到了批判，许多学校对学生过分强求一律、限制过多等作法也有所纠正。经过这次讨论，大家还明确了今后在教育方法上必须注意了解和研究学生的个性特征、年龄特征、分别对象进行教育，以便更好地贯彻全面发展的教育方针。但是在最近一个期间的工作实践中证明，培养和发展学生的个性、特长必须建立在全面发展的基础上，同时使学生对集体同个人、纪律同自由、民主同集中的关系有统一的理解，只有这样才能保证教育方针的正确贯彻。
    为了巩固成绩，进一步克服缺点，与会者一致认为，各中等学校和教师必须积极加强领导，发挥主动精神，改进和提高教育和教学工作，同时必须大力加强对学生的政治思想教育。会议指出，目前不少学校还存在着教育同教学工作在一定程度上彼此脱节的缺点，有些教师只注意课堂教学，而对学生的思想和生活却不够关心。同时，也有些学校对班主任工作缺乏领导，有些学校只由少数教师或团队干部担负对学生的政治思想教育工作。这些缺点应当加以克服。
    会议提出：对学生进行政治思想教育是每一个教师的光荣责任，要求教师们更多地注意通过课堂教学对学生进行政治思想教育，使教育同教学工作密切结合起来，同时也需要通过课外生活加强对学生的思想教育工作。
    在政治思想教育的内容方面，会议提出了以下几点要求：一、加强对学生的社会主义教育和艰苦朴素教育，使学生了解社会主义的光荣前途和建设工作的艰苦性，鼓励学生积极学习。二、加强对学生的爱国主义和国际主义的教育。三、加强阶级观点和劳动观点的教育。四、加强集体主义教育。五、努力培养学生的共产主义道德品质。
    会上，各校领导干部还交流了一些工作经验。市一中、三中、十八中等校还提出了一些改进目前学校教育工作的具体措施；有的学校还建议市教育局、团市委加强对学生政治思想教育工作的领导。最后，中共天津市委教育工作部部长梁寒冰作了总结发言。
