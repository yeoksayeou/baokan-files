    Tail
    (Fable)
    There was a monkey playing with a rooster in the yard. The rooster ate grain, and it also ate grain; the rooster ate pebbles, and it also ate pebbles, resulting in a terrible stomach ache, and it was sent to the hospital...
    Ahem, ahem, I've read many fables like this – the reader will surely say – I've already guessed what comes next: it's nothing more than the doctor making a diagnosis, calling the illness "indigestion," and then your fable, which is supposed to satirize the dogmatic learning method, comes to an end.
    The reader is right, but this fable also has a tail: the doctor, based on the principle of treating the cause, gave the monkey a bottle of brain tonic. The monkey thought to itself: "The illness is in my stomach, but they're giving me brain tonic: what's the logic behind that?" So, it justifiably threw the bottle of medicine into the garbage hole.
    Actually, we've only now gotten to the main point: Aren't some of us also examining our mistakes, yet justifiably refusing to "dig at the roots" in our thinking with remedies that address the illness, and thus, like the monkey, still retaining a tail?

    尾巴
    （寓言）
    有一只猴子，跟着公鸡在院子里玩。公鸡吃谷，它也吃谷，公鸡吃石子，它也吃石子，结果肚子痛得厉害，送到医院里……
    咳，咳，这样的寓言我看得多了，——读者一定会说——下文我早就猜着了：无非是医生作了诊断，管这个病叫做“食而不化”，于是你这个算是讽刺教条主义学习方法的寓言也就收场了。
    读者说得对，不过这篇寓言也还有一个尾巴：医生根据原因治疗法，给了猴子一瓶补脑汁。猴子心中捉摸：“患的是肠胃病，给的是补脑汁：这根据的是什么逻辑呀？”于是就理直气壮地把那一瓶药丢到垃圾洞里去了。
    其实，说到这里才入了正题：我们有些人，岂不也检讨错误，然而却理直气壮地拒绝对症下药地在思想上“挖根”，因此像猴子一样的还留着一段尾巴吗？
