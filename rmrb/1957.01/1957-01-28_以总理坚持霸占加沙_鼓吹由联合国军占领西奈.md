Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: According to a report by Agence France-Presse, Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion, in a conversation with AFP reporters in the Israeli area of Jerusalem on January 25th, advocated for "turning Sinai into a buffer zone occupied by UN forces." He insisted that this was the best way to "restore peace in the Middle East."

On the Gaza issue, Ben-Gurion reiterated that Israeli police should "maintain internal and external security in this region." He demanded that the United Nations give Israel firm support on this issue. The so-called reasons he gave were: the "geographical factors" between Gaza and Israel, and the "economic cooperation that has already begun" between them.

    以总理坚持霸占加沙
    鼓吹由联合国军占领西奈
    据新华社27日讯　据法新社报道，以色列总理本—古里安1月25日在耶路撒冷以色列区对法新社记者发表谈话时，主张“把西奈变成一个由联合国军占领的缓冲区”。他硬说，这是“恢复中东和平”的最好办法。
    在加沙问题上，本—古里安重申要由以色列的民警来“维护这个地区的内部和外部的安全”。他要求联合国在这个问题上给予以色列坚决的支持。他举出的所谓理由就是：加沙和以色列的“地理因素”以及它们之间“已经开始经济合作”。
