    Qu County's Thousand Mu of White Peony Harvested Abundantly
    The thousand mu of white peony in Qu County, Sichuan, has had a bumper harvest, increasing the income of farmers by more than 600,000 yuan. White peony is a commonly used Chinese medicine for pain relief and tonification. As of the end of November last year, the county's supply and marketing cooperative's Chinese herbal medicine purchasing station had purchased more than 430,000 jin, exceeding the purchasing plan by one time. Currently, more than 300,000 jin have been transferred to provinces such as Fujian, Gansu, Liaoning, and Shandong. (Duan Chuanqu)
