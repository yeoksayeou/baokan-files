Xinhua News Agency, 29th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Lijun reports: After listening to the reports from the first group of investigation teams, the Ministry of Education recently conducted multiple studies and discussions, and proposed preliminary opinions on several important issues currently being debated in education work and the 1957 national education plan.

The discussion on the education policy of all-round development has been going on nationwide for several months. At present, this discussion involves too much exploration of nouns and concepts, and lacks concrete analysis of the actual situation. Therefore, the Ministry of Education believes that in the future, the focus should be on drawing correct conclusions from the study and summary of practical problems, and on in-depth research into measures and methods to implement "teaching students according to their aptitude" in teaching and guidance work in the future.

Regarding the revision of the current middle school teaching plan, after discussion, the Ministry of Education's preliminary opinion is: some changes should be made in the subject settings. Hygiene knowledge should be removed from junior high school and foreign languages added; Chinese should be removed from senior high school, and drafting should be temporarily suspended; senior high school practical courses should generally not be offered except for key experimental research. Regarding the issue of political classes, some people in the discussion believe that the effectiveness of political classes has not been great in recent years, and the content of the teaching materials is not appropriate enough, so they advocate that political classes should not be offered in other grades except for the constitution class in the third year of senior high school, which should continue to be retained. Some people disagree with this opinion, believing that it is still necessary to have political classes in other grades, but the teaching content should be appropriately reformed to strengthen education on current affairs policies and the communist morality of young people. In terms of appropriately reducing the number of class hours in each grade, the preliminary opinion is: except for 31 hours in the first semester of the second year of junior high school, the others should be between 27 and 30 hours. In connection with the revision of the teaching plan, everyone believes that the teaching materials for subjects such as literature, physics, and history in senior high school should also be appropriately streamlined.

Regarding the revision of the primary school teaching plan, the basic spirit should be to strengthen the teaching of basic subjects, especially to strengthen the teaching of Chinese. Therefore, the number of class hours for Chinese should be considered for increase. The arithmetic class should add content such as fractions and percentages, and eliminate agricultural bookkeeping; abacus calculation should be studied in the fifth and sixth grades. Some people have also proposed adding content on basic agricultural knowledge to natural science teaching. Since the conditions of primary school teachers, equipment, and scale vary greatly across the country, everyone believes in the discussion that the implementation of the primary school teaching plan should allow for a certain degree of flexibility.

The preliminary opinions on revising the teaching plan of normal schools are mainly to appropriately reduce the proportion of professional courses and increase the proportion of cultural courses. The number of subjects should be reduced from the existing 36 to 24; the excessive number of teaching method courses for each subject should be reduced, and only the teaching methods of Chinese, arithmetic, and natural science should be retained. Children's literature will no longer be set up as a separate subject.

Regarding the preliminary revision opinions of the teaching plan, the Ministry of Education plans to solicit opinions from various parties and make a decision after careful research.

The Ministry of Education studied some issues related to the development of education and believes that the development of various undertakings in general education in 1956 exceeded the possible conditions, which affected the quality of education. When compiling the education plan for 1957, we should adhere to the principle of "appropriate contraction and guaranteeing key areas," and consider both needs and possibilities to put the undertaking on a fully reliable foundation. The preliminary opinions on future development are mainly: Normal education is the focus of education, and it still needs to be appropriately developed next year so that the qualified teachers needed for primary and secondary schools during the second five-year plan period can be basically guaranteed. Due to funding limitations, primary school education cannot meet the requirements for school-age children to enroll. In order to give more children the opportunity to study, in addition to public primary schools, private schools should still be allowed in the future. Private forms can be diverse, and children's literacy classes, private classes, and private primary schools can be run. The requirements for private schools should be different from those for public schools to a certain extent, and it is impossible to force formality or uniformity. In 1957, it is planned not to run "hat-wearing" middle schools (that is, to run junior high school classes in complete primary schools and senior high school classes in junior high schools), and the existing "hat-wearing" schools in various places should be carefully adjusted appropriately. The current staffing of teachers is too tight, and it should be reasonably resolved under possible conditions in the future.

The second group of investigation teams dispatched by the Ministry of Education is currently conducting investigations and research in Hunan, Shandong, Henan and other places.

### 教育部经过调查研究  对当前教育工作中若干问题提出初步意见

    教育部经过调查研究
    对当前教育工作中若干问题提出初步意见
    新华社29日讯　新华社记者张丽君报道：教育部最近在听取了第一批调查组的调查汇报以后，经过多次的研究和讨论，就当前教育工作中正在争论的若干重要问题和1957年全国教育事业计划问题提出了初步意见。
    关于全面发展的教育方针问题的讨论在全国已经进行了好几个
  月。目前这种讨论在名词、概念方面的探讨过多，缺乏对实际情况的具体分析。因此教育部认为，今后要着重从研究总结实际问题中去得出正确的结论，并且要深入研究今后在教学、教导工作中贯彻“因材施教”的措施和办法。
    对于现行中学教学计划的修改，经过讨论，教育部初步意见是：在学科设置上要作一些变动。初中取消卫生常识，增设外国语；高中
  取消汉语，制图暂时停授；高中实
  习课除重点试验研究外，一般学校
  也暂不开设。对于政治课的问题，在讨论中有一部分人认为近几年来政治课效果不大，教材内容也不够适当，主张除高三的宪法课继续保留外，其他年级都不设政治课。一部分人不同意这个意见，认为其他年级还有必要设政治课，不过在教学内容上应该适当改革，加强时事政策和青年的共产主义道德品质的教育。在适当减少各年级的授课时数方面，初步意见是：除初二第一学期为三十一小时外，其他都在二十七—三十小时之间。联系着教学计划的修改，大家认为高中的文学、物理、历史等学科的教材也应作适当的精简。
    关于小学教学计划的修改，基本精神应该是加强基本学科的教学，特别是加强语文的教学。因此，语文科的教学时数应该考虑增加。算术课中应该增加分数、百分数等内容，取消农业簿记；珠算改在五、六年级学习。还有人提出在自然教学内，增设农业基础知识的内容。由于全国各地小学师资、设备、规模等条件差别很大，因此讨论中大家认为，执行小学教学计划应该允许有一定的灵活性。
    修改师范学校教学计划的初步意见，主要是适当减少业务课的比重，增加文化课比重。科目由现有的三十六门减少到二十四门；减少了过多的各科教学法课程，只保留语文、算术、自然三科的教学法。儿童文学不再单独设科。
    关于教学计划的初步修改意见，教育部准备多方面征求意见，经过慎重研究以后再作决定。
    教育部研究了有关教育事业发展中的一些问题，认为1956年普通教育各项事业的发展超出了可能条件，影响了教育质量。编制1957年的教育事业计划，应当根据“适当收缩、保证重点”的方针，既要考虑需要，又要照顾可能，把事业放在充分可靠的基础上。对今后事业发展的初步意见主要是：师范教育是教育事业的重点，明年仍需作适当发展，使第二个五年计划期内中小学必需的合格的师资基本上能得到保证。小学教育由于经费限制，不可能满足学龄儿童入学的要求。为了使更多的儿童得到学习机会，今后除公立小学外，仍应允许民办。民办的形式可以多种多样，可以办儿童识字班、民办班、民办小学。对民办学校的要求应和公立学校有一定差别，不能强求正规、强求一律。1957年准备不再举办“戴帽子”的中学（就是在完全小学加办初中班，在初级中学加办高中班），对各地现有的“戴帽子”的学校要慎重地予以适当调整。目前教师编制太紧，今后要在可能条件下得到合理的解决。
    教育部派出的第二批调查组现在正在湖南、山东、河南等地进行调查研究。
