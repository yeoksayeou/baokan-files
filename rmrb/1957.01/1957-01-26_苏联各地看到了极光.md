Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 25th: On the night of January 22nd, intense auroras were seen across the northern and central regions of the Soviet Union, and even as far south as Ukraine. The region where the aurora appeared strongest was Omsk.

	That night, a pale green arch-shaped light appeared in the northern sky, with crimson spots on either side. From these spots, orange-yellow rays of light were emitted, constantly shifting and changing. The aurora was accompanied by a strong magnetic storm. Short and long-wave radio communications in Moscow and other cities experienced severe interference. According to scientists, this phenomenon occurred due to physical processes on the sun: In recent days, extremely strong explosions have occurred on the sun, and groups of sunspots that are constantly changing have appeared on the sun's meridian. Streams of charged particles are emitted from the sun into space, and these particles cause flashes of light high in the atmosphere when they reach the Earth. Because the stream of charged particles emitted from the sun is very powerful, it has caused the aurora, which is usually only visible at high latitudes within the Arctic Circle, to shift towards lower latitudes.

	The years with the most intense solar activity repeat cyclically approximately every eleven years. This change will be very intense in 1958. Auroras as intense as the one that occurred this year may reappear next year.

    苏联各地看到了极光
    新华社莫斯科25日电　1月22日深夜，在苏联领土的北部、中部，甚至在乌克兰南部地区都看到了强烈的极光。极光显得最强烈的地区是鄂木斯克。
    这天深夜，在北方的天空中出现了淡绿色的拱门式的光亮，在这种光亮的两旁有绛红色的斑点，接着从这些斑点中放射出不断转移和变化的橙黄色的光线。伴随着极光出现的有强烈的磁暴。在莫斯科和其他城市长短波无线电联系都发生了严重的干扰。据科学工作者们说，这种现象的发生是由于太阳中发生的物理过程：最近几天在太阳上发生了极强烈的爆炸，在太阳上的子午线出现了不断变化的黑斑群。从太阳上向太空散发出带电粒子流，这些粒子流在到达地球的时候在高空中引起闪光。因为太阳中散发出来的带电粒子流非常强大，所以使一般只能够在高纬度的极圈内看到的极光，移向低纬度地带。
    太阳变化最强烈的年份，大约每隔十一年周期地重复一次。1958年这种变化将十分强烈。像今年发生的这样强烈的极光，明年可能重复出现。
