Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 16th: Premier Zhou Enlai held a press conference at the Belweder Palace in Warsaw at 9:00 AM on January 16th.

　　　　Sino-Polish Friendship
    At the press conference, when asked by a Polish Press Agency reporter what the best way to realize friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Polish people was, Premier Zhou Enlai replied: We are both socialist countries, and there is no fundamental conflict of interest between our two countries. Therefore, mutual visits between the leaders of the two countries, mutual contact between the parties of the two countries, and mutual exchanges between the people of the two countries can strengthen our mutual understanding. More importantly, we must strengthen cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields. The joint statement just signed powerfully demonstrates this point.
　　　　The Significance of This Visit
    A reporter asked: What is the significance of your trip for consolidating the unity of socialist countries?
    Premier Zhou Enlai said: Every contact and agreement reached between socialist countries contributes to the consolidation of the socialist camp. Therefore, although the visit of the Chinese government delegation to Poland was short, it was warmly welcomed by the Polish people, all the way until the final signing of the joint statement. I believe that this contact and meeting will definitely help consolidate the socialist camp.
　　　　Religious Believers in China
    Premier Zhou Enlai, in answering a question from a Warsaw Catholic newspaper, said: In China, there are tens of millions of Buddhists, tens of millions of Muslims, and millions of Christians and Catholics; the fact that they are theists does not prevent them from participating in socialist construction. Precisely because they are patriots, they actively participate in socialist construction.
    Poland's Role in Defending Peace
    Regarding the question of Poland's role in defending peace and strengthening the socialist camp, Premier Zhou Enlai replied: The role is very significant. Poland not only plays a role in defending European peace but also in maintaining peace in the Far East. As the location of the Warsaw Pact, Poland's role in strengthening the socialist camp is clearly very important. The recently announced joint statement of the Soviet-Polish talks is also of great significance in strengthening the socialist camp.
　　　　Impressions of Visiting South Asia
    Reporters from Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania asked Premier Zhou for his impressions of visiting South Asia. Premier Zhou replied: The impression is very good. The people there expressed a universal desire for peace and friendship. These three reporters also asked Premier Zhou Enlai for his opinion on the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Premier Zhou Enlai said: The United States' policy is to replace Britain and France in the Middle East, and to implement a colonialist policy towards the Middle East.
　　　　Sino-Indian Talks
    A reporter from "Warsaw Life" newspaper asked about the results of the several meetings between the Chinese Premier and the Indian Prime Minister. Premier Zhou Enlai said: China and India are initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and our exchange of views is guided by the Five Principles. You can be confident that our exchange of views is always beneficial to world peace and the relaxation of the international situation, and will not be the opposite.

    周总理在华沙举行记者招待会
    新华社华沙16日电　1月16日上午九时，周恩来总理在华沙贝尔维德宫举行了记者招待会。
            中波友好
    在招待会上，波兰通讯社记者问，实现中波两国人民友好合作的最好的道路是什么，周恩来总理回答说：我们都是社会主义国家，我们两国之间没有根本的利害冲突，因此，两国领导人的互相来往，两国党的互相接触，两国人民的互相来往，可以加强我们的相互了解。更重要的是，在政治、经济和文化各方面都要加强合作，刚才签订的联合声明，也有力地表现了这一点。
        这次访问的意义
    有记者问：你这次旅行对巩固社会主义国家团结的意义如何？
    周恩来总理说：社会主义各国每一次接触和所达成的协议，都有助于社会主义阵营的巩固。因此，中国政府代表团访问波兰虽然时间很短，但受到波兰人民的热烈欢迎，一直到最后签订联合声明。我相信这次接触和会谈一定会对社会主义阵营的巩固有帮助。
          中国的宗教徒
    周恩来总理在回答华沙一家天主教报纸的问题时说：在中国，信佛教的人上万万，信伊斯兰教的人上千万，信基督教、天主教的人上百万；并不因为他们是有神论者就妨碍他们参加社会主义建设，正因为他们是爱国者，他们积极参加社会主义建设。
    波兰在保卫和平中的作用
    对于波兰在保卫和平和加强社会主义阵营中的作用的问题，周恩来总理回答说：作用是很大的，波兰不仅在保卫欧洲和平，而且也在维护远东和平的事业中起作用。作为华沙条约所在地的波兰，对于加强社会主义阵营的作用，显然是很重要的。不久前宣布的波苏会谈联合声明对于加强社会主义阵营的作用也是很大的。
        访问南亚的印象
    捷、保、罗三国记者问周总理访问南亚的印象，周总理回答说：印象很好。那里的人民表现出要求和平、要求友好的普遍愿望。这三位记者还问到周恩来总理对于“艾森豪威尔主义”有什么意见，周恩来总理说：美国的政策就是要代替英、法在中近东的地位，就是实行对中近东的殖民主义政策。
            中印会谈
      “华沙生活报”记者问到中国总理同印度总理数次会谈的结果，周恩来总理说：中印两国是和平共处五项原则的倡议国，我们之间交换意见是以五项原则为指导思想的。你们可以相信，我们之间交换意见总是对世界和平和国际局势的和缓有利而不会相反的。
