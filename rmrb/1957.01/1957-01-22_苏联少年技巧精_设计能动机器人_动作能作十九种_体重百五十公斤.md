Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 20th. At the recent Eighth Moscow Regional Junior Technicians' Conference, a robot with "vision" steadily walked onto the stage, waving to welcome the attendees.

This robot was one of many fascinating exhibits at the conference. Its designers were ninth-grade students and active members of the Chkalov Technical Station.

This robot can perform nineteen actions. It can twist its body, wave its arms, bend its elbows, and grasp objects with its fingers. When light shines on its left eye, it turns to the right; when light shines on its right eye, it turns to the left. When reporters took its picture, it was "startled" by the intense flash and suddenly froze, even taking a few steps backward.

The robot is operated by radio control, weighs a total of one hundred and fifty kilograms, and contains electric motors, photoelectric relays, solenoids, and many other devices. Its "panic" when photographed was the result of intense light simultaneously acting on two photoelectric relays.

The young technicians decided to further improve their design. The improved "robot" will have better "vision" and will be able to avoid obstacles on its own. It will gain the ability to speak, narrating its resume using a hidden tape recorder. The young technicians also decided to give it "hearing." By then, the "robot" will be able to execute human commands.

### 苏联少年技巧精  设计能动机器人  动作能作十九种  体重百五十公斤

    苏联少年技巧精  设计能动机器人
    动作能作十九种  体重百五十公斤
    新华社莫斯科20日电　在不久以前举行的第八届莫斯科州少年技术员大会上，一个有“视觉”的机器人稳步走出舞台，挥手欢迎到会的人们。
    这个机器人是在这次大会上展出的许多饶有趣味的展品之一。它的设计师是一些九年级的学生、契卡洛夫技术站的积极分子。
    这个机器人能够作十九种动作。它会扭转身躯、挥动胳膊、肘部能曲伸、手指能抓东西。用光线照射它的左眼，它就会向右转，照射它的右眼，它就会向左转。当新闻记者给它照像的时候，它由于受到闪光灯的猛烈照射而“惊慌”得突然怔住了，甚至向后倒退了几步。
    机器人是由无线电操纵的，体重共一百五十公斤，身体内部装有电动机、光控继电器、螺线管以及许多其他装置。在给它照像时它所表现的“惊慌失措”，是强烈的光线同时作用于两个光控继电器的结果。
    少年技术员们决定进一步改进他们的设计。改进后的“机器人”将会有更好的“视觉”，并且能自己躲开障碍物。它将获得说话的能力：靠着隐蔽的录音机叙述自己的履历。少年技术员还决定赋予它“听觉”。到那时候“机器人”就可以执行人的命令了。
