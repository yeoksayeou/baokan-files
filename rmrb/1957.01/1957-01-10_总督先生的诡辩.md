    The Governor's Sophistry

    After the United Nations decided to discuss the Algerian issue, the French Governor of Algeria, Lacoste, seemed a bit surprised. He swore and vowed: "There is no war in Algeria!"

    This Governor explained: "France is not firing cannons or dropping bombs on innocent civilians. We have a vibrant country where we are doing our best to protect people's lives. Anyone can go to Algeria to see that there is nothing to hide...."

    However, people don't need to go to Algeria to see that there is indeed a war in Algeria, and that this war is escalating. From November 1954 to now, the number of French troops stationed in Algeria has increased from over one hundred thousand to six hundred thousand; France spent more than 480 billion francs on military expenses in Algeria in 1956 alone. If there really is no war in Algeria, then why would France send so many troops and spend so much money?

    Perhaps, the Governor wants to argue that all of this is not war, but simply to do everything possible to "protect" the lives of the Algerian people. Well, let's take a look at the reports from journalists who have been to Algeria. Here are a few examples at random: On April 23rd of last year, French troops dispatched a large number of aircraft and used bombs to completely raze a village called Mijdar. In Constantine, on March 29th of last year alone, French troops shot and killed about four hundred Algerians. In Algiers, on May 27th of last year alone, French military police arrested about two thousand Algerians. In this way, in the past two years, France has massacred 300,000 men, women, and children in Algeria, and made 500,000 peaceful residents lose their homes. What France is conducting in Algeria is not only a war, but also a bloody colonial war.

    Despite the Governor's astonishing sophistry, as the Governor himself said, there is "nothing to hide" in Algeria. Even the Governor's superior, Prime Minister Mollet, had to admit in a document issued on October 29th of last year: "This long period of bloodshed" in Algeria has never stopped. The Governor's attempt to evade the condemnation of world opinion at the United Nations General Assembly by stubbornly concealing the undeniable truth will only make himself more disgraceful! (Yi)

### 总督先生的诡辩

    总督先生的诡辩
    在联合国决定讨论阿尔及利亚问题以后，法国驻阿尔及利亚的总督拉戈斯特似乎有些吃惊了。他赌咒发誓地说：“在阿尔及利亚并没有战争啊！”
    这位总督先生解释道：“法国并没有向无辜的老百姓开炮和投炸弹。我们有一个生气勃勃的国家，在这个国家里，我们竭尽全力来保护人们的生命。谁都可以到阿尔及利亚去看看，那儿没有任何东西可以隐瞒的……。”
    但是，人们不需要到阿尔及利亚去看，也都知道在阿尔及利亚的确有着战争，而且这个战争还在越来越扩大。从1954年11月到现在，法国在阿尔及利亚的驻军从十几万人增加到六十万人；光是1956年一年法国在阿尔及利亚的军费就花了四千八百多亿法郎。如果在阿尔及利亚果真没有战争，那末法国为什么要派去这样多的军队和花掉这样多的军费呢？
    也许，总督先生要争辩说：所有这一切都不是战争，而只是为了竭尽全力来“保护”阿尔及利亚人民的生命。那末，让我们看一下到阿尔及利亚去过的记者的报道吧。下面是随便举出的几个例子：去年4月23日，法国驻军出动了大批飞机，用炸弹把一个名叫密芝达斯的村子整个荡平了。在君士坦丁城，只是去年3月29日一天内，法军枪杀了四百个左右的阿尔及利亚人。在阿尔及尔，仅仅在去年5月27日一天内，法国军警就逮捕了约二千名阿尔及利亚人。就这样，两年来，法国在阿尔及利亚屠杀了三十万男女小孩，并且使五十万和平居民失去了他们的家园。法国在阿尔及利亚进行的不但是一场战争，而且是一场血腥的殖民战争。
    尽管总督先生有着惊人的诡辩才能，但是正如总督先生所说的，在阿尔及利亚是“没有任何东西可以隐瞒的”。连总督先生的上级摩勒总理在去年10月29日发出的一个文件里也不得不承认：在阿尔及利亚“这场长时期的流血”一直没有停止过。总督先生为了想在联合国大会上逃避世界舆论的谴责，就硬要隐瞒无法隐瞒的事实真相，这只会使他自己更丢脸罢了！　（义）
