    Let "Playing the Dragon" Reappear on the Streets
    Xia Jing
    Are you from Sichuan? When you were little, were you fascinated by the festive bustle of the streets during the New Year? You should know that "playing the dragon" is a dance form beloved by the masses in the Sichuan region. Every New Year, it appears on the streets, attracting people of all ages, both men and women.
    There are many stories about the "dragon," and in general, it possesses authority and power in people's minds, sometimes representing the symbol of good and evil. Through the creation of folk artists, it has been given a living life, lively and with personality.
    The people who "play the dragon" are often young and strong lads, holding colorful fake dragons made of silk and supported by bamboo poles. These talented dancers can give the fake dragon a living life. You can tell if it is a "young" dragon or an "old" dragon. Is it happy? Or is it angry?
    In mythology, "fireworks" are a very beautiful thing. Setting off fireworks before the dragon appears further enhances the sense of mystery.
    If you are accustomed to the Sichuan gongs and drums, you will know that the skills of gongs and drums are exquisite; due to its urgency, slowness, lightness, and heaviness, it intricately expresses the plot of the story and possesses emotion with the development of the story. The music for playing the dragon is mainly gongs and drums. I like its strong sound rhythm, which shows a kind of power, making people feel a healthy and optimistic mood. Gong and drum music strengthens the expression of the dragon's character.
    For a long time, "playing the dragon" has not appeared on the streets during the New Year. This time, I watched "Playing the Dragon" performed by the Sichuan Provincial Delegation at the National Professional Troupe Music and Dance Performance, and an uncontrollable joy immersed me in the memories of childhood festival fun, feeling so kind and lovely. The strong sound of gongs and drums, the beautiful fireworks, the young men's vigorous posture of dragon dancing, filled with a tense and optimistic fighting atmosphere, give people an upward force. This street art reappears on the stage, more refined and beautiful, giving people a strong and profound impression!
    Don't let such a beautiful traditional folk dance art be lost. Let it reappear on the streets!

    让“玩龙”再出现在街头
    夏静
    你是四川人吗？在你小的时候，可曾迷恋过年节时间街头的热闹？要知道，“玩龙”是我们四川地区群众所喜欢的一种舞蹈形式。每逢年节，它就出现在街头，无论男女老幼都会被它吸引住。
    关于“龙”的故事，传说很多，总之它在人的心目中具有一种权威和力量，有时代表着善与恶的象征，经过民间艺人的创造，就给它赋予了活的生命，活泼而具有个性。
    玩“龙”的人，常常是一些年青健壮的小伙子，他们手里拿着竹杆所撑着的常常是绸子做的彩色缤纷的假龙，这些天才的舞蹈家们却能给假龙以活的生命，你会晓得它是“年青”的龙？还是“年老”的龙？它是在高兴？还是在生气？
    在神话中，“焰火”是一种很美的东西，在龙出现之前放焰火，更给人加强神秘的感觉。
    听惯了四川锣鼓就知道锣鼓的技巧是有讲究的；由于它的急促，缓慢，轻，重，都随着故事的发展，很复杂地表现出故事的情节并具有情感。玩龙的音乐主要是锣鼓，我喜欢它的强烈的音响节奏，它显示出一种力量，使人觉着一种健康和乐观的情调。锣鼓音乐，加强了对于龙的性格的表现。
    很久了，年节中也不见“玩龙”出现街头。这次，在全国专业团体音乐舞蹈会演上看了四川省代表团演出的“玩龙”，一种抑止不住的喜悦使我沉浸在童年节日欢乐的回忆里，感到这样亲切，可爱。锣鼓强烈的音响，美丽的焰火，小伙子们舞龙的矫健的姿态，充满了紧张的乐观的战斗气氛，给人一种向上的力量。这一街头艺术再现在舞台上，更加精炼而优美，给人强烈而深刻的印象！
    不要让这样优美的传统民间舞蹈艺术失传了。让它再在街头出现吧！
