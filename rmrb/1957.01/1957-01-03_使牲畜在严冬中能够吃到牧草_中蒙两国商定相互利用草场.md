Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar -- China and the Mongolian People's Republic have agreed to mutually and rationally utilize adjacent grasslands within their respective territories, enabling livestock from both countries to eat pasture during severe winters. Hundreds of thousands of Mongolian livestock have already been moved into the Xilin Gol Grassland in China, and some livestock from the Hulunbuir Grassland in China will also be moved to the Mongolian Grassland for the winter.

The pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China are closely connected to the pastoral areas of the Mongolian People's Republic, with vast and boundless grasslands. After the snowfall last winter, the snow depth on the grasslands varied. The snow in the Mongolian pastoral areas near the Xilin Gol Grassland was excessively deep, making it difficult for livestock to graze. However, the adjacent Chinese Xilin Gol Grassland had surplus pasture with less snow cover. After consultation and agreement between relevant departments of the two governments, more than one hundred thousand livestock belonging to Mongolian herdsmen were moved into the Chinese pastoral area for the winter. Recently, the northern part of the Hulunbuir Grassland in China has experienced heavy snowfall, and a request was made to move some livestock into the Mongolian Grassland for grazing, which has been agreed to by the Mongolian side. A Mongolian government delegation led by Major General Damdin Hoshuu has already flown to the border between the two countries to discuss and survey the pastureland with Chinese representatives. Soon, Chinese livestock will be able to move in.

    中蒙两国商定相互利用草场
    新华社乌兰巴托电　中国和蒙古人民共和国商定相互合理地利用双方境内邻近的草场，使两国牧畜在严冬能够吃到牧草。蒙古的十几万头牲畜已经移入中国的锡林郭勒草原，中国呼伦贝尔草原的部分牲畜也将移到蒙古草原过冬。
    中国内蒙古自治区的牧区同蒙古人民共和国的牧区紧紧相连，草原广阔无垠。去冬降雪以后，草原积雪深浅不一，靠近锡林郭勒草原的蒙古牧区的积雪过深，牲畜吃草困难，而临近的中国锡林郭勒草原却有积雪少的多余草场，经两国政府有关部门协商同意，蒙古牧民的十多万头牲畜移入中国牧区过冬。最近，中国呼伦贝尔草原北部积雪较大，请求将部分牲畜移入蒙古草原放牧，已经蒙古方面同意。由达木丁呼少将率领的蒙古政府代表团已经乘飞机去两国边境同中国代表商讨和勘查牧场，不久中国牲畜就可以移入。
