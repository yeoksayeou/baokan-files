Interpretation of "Ugly Duck and Goose"
Guo Moruo

    "Fishing nets are spread to catch fish and shrimp,
    But they catch a stinky toad.
    Hoping to match it with a romantic fellow,
    But it's matched with a hunchbacked old man."

These lines of poetry are translated from the third chapter of the "New Terrace" poem in the "Book of Songs", "Bei Feng." The original text is "The fish net is set, the wild geese are caught in it. Seeking a gentle match, one obtains this hunchback."

The "鸿 (Hong)" character in the poem has been interpreted by previous scholars as the "鸿鹄 (Honghu)" wild swan, which is somewhat untenable in terms of poetic rules. Mr. Wen Yiduo said that this "鸿 (Hong)" character is the clipped sound of "苦蠪 (Kulong)." According to "Guang Ya" and "Miscellaneous Records of Famous Doctors," "苦蠪 (Kulong)" is another name for toad or frog. Thus, one character is brought to life, and the entire chapter and entire poem are also brought to life.

Recently, Mr. Wang Lun refuted Wen's theory and wrote an article entitled "A Rectification of Mr. Wen Yiduo's 'New Terrace Hong Character Theory'" (Guangming Daily, December 30, 1956, "Literary Heritage").

Mr. Wang said: "There are two types of Hong, large and small. The large Hong is a large bird that flies high, and the small Hong is a type of waterfowl, about the size of a duck." The basis is Lu Ji's "Commentary on Plants, Animals, Insects, and Fish in the Book of Songs": "There is also a small Hong, about the size of a duck, and its color is also white. Today people simply call it Hong."

This is a new revelation that can supplement the shortcomings of Wen's theory.

What exactly the "small Hong" is, is currently impossible to determine. But it is clearly stated that "today people simply call it Hong," indicating that this appellation was a southern dialect during the Wei and Jin dynasties. Whether this dialect already existed before the Wei and Jin dynasties, and whether it had already spread to the Yellow River basin (the "New Terrace" poem is a satire on Duke Xuan of Wei), these are all questions, and they may be impossible to answer.

But Mr. Wang hastily concludes that the "鸿 (Hong)" character in "New Terrace" refers to this small Hong, and directly accuses Wen's theory as "groundless talk," which is a bit too impatient.

Moreover, Mr. Wang also made an inappropriate mistake in his article. He said in his article:

    "Since the Hong is like a duck, according to the Erya: 'The duck and goose are of the same kind and have webbed feet. Since the duck is not beautiful, of course the Hong is also considered not beautiful.'"

This is completely wrong. "凫雁丑 (Fu Yan Chou)" means the duck and goose type. "丑 (Chou)" is the "kind" of "丑类 (Choulei - kind)," not the "ugly" of "美丑 (Mei Chou - beauty and ugliness)." In the "Explanation of Birds" in the Erya, there are several examples of this usage.

    "The magpie and shrike are of the same kind, their flight is fluttering.
    The kite and crow are of the same kind, their flight is soaring.
    The hawk and falcon are of the same kind, their flight is swooping.
    The duck and goose are of the same kind, their feet are webbed and their heels stand tall;
    The crow and magpie are of the same kind, their palms are contracted."

In addition, there are more examples in the Erya, which will not be listed further. But these all mean "of the same kind," not "not beautiful."

Then we can also ask: Is the duck beautiful or not? Although beauty and ugliness can change with people's preferences and feelings, in the eyes of the ancients, generally speaking, ducks were not considered "not beautiful." There are several places in the Book of Songs that mention ducks. For example:

    "Soaring and gliding, shooting ducks and geese." (Zheng Feng, "The Woman Says the Cock Crows")
    "Ducks and gulls are on the islet." (Da Ya, "Ducks and Gulls") (There are five examples in the poem, only one is selected)

How full of pictorial meaning these lines of poetry are! Ducks and geese and gulls have always been good poetic material, mainly because they are not "not beautiful." Generally, waterfowl, especially those that are good at flying, have elements of beauty. To both dive and fly, in order to reduce air and water resistance, their bodies are adapted to be streamlined. This is why they are loved by people.

The ancients did not consider ducks to be "not beautiful," I think there is no problem. When the ancients made objects, they often used duck shapes for beautification. For example, duck zun (wine vessels), duck boats, duck clogs, and the like. Especially duck clogs, which are a type of pointed slippers, are often abbreviated, and only the word "duck" is used as a poetic substitute for straw sandals and the like.

Since the duck is beautiful, and the small Hong is a white duck, it should be even more beautiful. Then, the problem comes back again. If the "鸿 (Hong)" character in "New Terrace" is a small Hong, then the poem becomes a big problem. If we interpret it as a small Hong, we can translate the two lines "The fish net is set, the wild geese are caught in it" as follows:

    "Fishing nets are spread to catch fish and shrimp,
    But they catch a white duck."

Here, for convenience, it is still only regarded as "one." In fact, there may be more than "one," because waterfowl fly and stop in groups, and there is often no distinction between singular and plural in Chinese grammar. But even just this "one" is a piece of unexpected luck. There are times when fishing with nets fails, but now a duck has been caught. Ducks are also delicious, and their price when sold is more expensive than fish. Isn't this good? Here, I think we can't even talk about beauty or ugliness, but rather about economic value.

Then, the following two lines of the original poem become problematic. They reverse the meaning.

If "鸿 (Hong)" is indeed a small Hong, a white duck, I think the poet's poem should be written in the following way to be reasonable and in line with the poetic method of metaphor and allegory.

    "Fishing nets are spread to catch fish and shrimp,
    But they catch a white duck.
    The hunchbacked old man has great luck,
    The bride is as beautiful as a peach blossom."

However, unfortunately, the original poem is not like this, and we cannot create freely.

Then, obviously, the small Hong theory is not suitable here either.

In my opinion, Wen Yiduo's theory is still correct and not "groundless," and we should not easily abandon it. (New Year's Day, 1957)

### 释“凫雁丑”

    释“凫雁丑”
    郭沫若
    “鱼网张来打鱼虾，
    打到一个臭虾蟆。
    心想配上多情哥，
    配上一位驼背爷”。
    这几句诗，是从诗经邶风新台篇第三章翻译出来的。原文是“鱼网之设，鸿则离（罹）之。燕婉之求，得此戚施。”
    诗中“鸿”字，前人都讲为鸿鹄之鸿，在诗法上就有点讲不通。闻一多先生说这个“鸿”字是“苦蠪”的促音。“苦蠪”，据广雅与名医别录，就是虾蟆或蟾蜍的别名。于是，一个字讲活了，整章诗、整篇诗也都讲活了。
    最近王纶先生反驳闻说，写了一篇“闻一多先生‘诗新台鸿字说’辨正”（光明日报1956年12月30日“文学遗产”）。
    王先生说：“鸿有大小二种，大鸿是高飞之大鸟，小鸿是一种水鸟，和凫差不多大小”。根据是陆玑的“毛诗草木鸟兽虫鱼疏”：“又有小鸿，大小如凫，色亦白，今人直谓鸿也”。
    这是新的揭发，可以补闻说的不足。
      “小鸿”究竟是什么鸟，目前尚无法断定。但既明言“今人直谓鸿”，可见这种称谓是魏晋时的江南方言。这种方言在魏晋前是否已经有，并是否已经通行到黄河流域（新台篇是刺卫宣公的诗），这些都是问题，而且可能是无法解答的问题。
    但王先生却据此断定：新台“鸿”字就是指的这种小鸿，而且直斥闻说为“凿空”之谈，这就未免太性急了一点。
    而且王先生在文章中还犯了一个不应有的错误。他在文章里说：
    “鸿既然像凫，尔雅：‘凫雁
  丑，其足蹼，凫既然不美，当然鸿也认为不美了。”
    这就完全错了。“凫雁丑”是说凫雁之类。丑是丑类之丑，并不是美丑之丑。在尔雅释鸟里面，这种用法就有好几例。
      “鹊鵙丑，其飞也翪。
    鸢乌丑，其飞也翔。
    鹰隼丑，其飞也翬。
    凫雁丑，其足蹼，其踵企；
    乌鹊丑，其掌缩。”
    此外，在尔雅中例子还多，不再举出了。但这些都是“之类”的意思，并不是“不美”。
    那吗还可以问问：凫，到底是美还是不美呢？美与不美虽然可以随人的嗜好和感触而转移，但在古人眼中，一般说来，并不曾以凫为“不美”。诗经中就有好几处说到凫。例如：
      “将翱将翔，弋凫与雁”。（郑风，女曰鸡鸣）
      “凫鷖在渚”。（大雅，凫鷖）（诗中有五例，只选其一）
    这些诗句多么富有画意！凫雁和鸥鸟（鷖）一直都是好诗料，主因应该在于它们并非“不美”。大凡水鸟类，特别是善于飞者，都具有美的因素。既要潜，又要飞，为了减低空气和水的阻力，它们的身躯就适应着成为流线型。这就是它们之所以受人喜爱的原因。
    古人不以凫为“不美”，我看是没有问题的。古人制物，为了美化，还每每采用凫形。例如，凫尊、凫舟、凫舃之类。特别是凫舃，这是一种尖头利屣，更往往略去舃字，而仅以凫字来作为草履之类的诗化代字了。
    凫既然美，小鸿是白色的凫，就应该更美。那吗，问题就又说回来了。新台“鸿”字如果是小鸿，那诗就大成问题。作为小鸿来解释，我们可以把“鱼网之设，鸿则离之”两句，另译如下。
    “鱼网张来打鱼虾，
    打到一只白水鸭。”
    这里，在便宜上，还是只作为“一只”。其实可能是不仅“一只”的，因为水禽是成群飞止的鸟，而汉语语法中单复数往往没有区别。但仅只这“一只”已经就是天外飞来的财喜了。网鱼有落空的时候，而现在却打到了水鸭。水鸭又好吃，出卖时价钱比鱼还贵。这还不好吗？在这里，我看甚至谈不上美不美的问题，而是要谈谈经济价值的。
    那吗，原诗的下两句接得就成问题了。它们把意思恰恰接反了。
    如果“鸿”的确是小鸿，白色的水鸭，我看诗人的诗就应该做成下面的样子，才合乎情理，也才合乎比兴的诗法。
    “鱼网张来打鱼虾，
      打到一只白水鸭。
      驼背公公走大运，
      新娘美貌赛桃花。”
    然而可惜，原诗并不是这样，我们不好自由创作。
    那吗，很明显，小鸿说在这里也并不适合。
    据我看来，闻一多的说法依然正确，并非“凿空”，我们还不好轻易抛弃。　　　　　（1957年元旦）
