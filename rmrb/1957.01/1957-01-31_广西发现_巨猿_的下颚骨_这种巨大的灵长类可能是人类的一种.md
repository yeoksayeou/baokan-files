    Guangxi Discovers Mandible of “Gigantopithecus”
    This Giant Primate May be a Kind of Human
    (By our correspondent Zhang Gu, from Guangxi Daily) A farmer, Tan Xiuhuai, of Xin She Village, Changchao Township, Liucheng County, Guangxi Province, discovered the mandible of "Gigantopithecus" in the Xiaoyan Cave of Lengzhai Mountain near this village. This discovery may solve the question of whether "Gigantopithecus" is an "ape" or a "human," and has significant scientific value.
    Between May and September of last year, Tan Xiuhuai, while accumulating fertilizer, found many animal bone fossils in the rock mud of Xiaoyan Cave on Lengzhai Mountain. Knowing that these were "dragon bones" from Chinese medicinal materials, he selected more than 100 jin and sent them to the Luoman Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Liujiang County for sale. At that time, the supply and marketing cooperative had stopped purchasing according to the "Notice on the Protection of Cultural Relics in Agricultural Production and Construction" issued by the State Council in early April last year. When Tan Xiuhuai was selling "dragon bones," Wei Yaoshe, the director of the Luoman People's Bank business office, was there. Wei Yaoshe saw a mandible with teeth in the "dragon bones" and thought it might have research value, so he mobilized Tan Xiuhuai to donate it to the government. Tan Xiuhuai agreed, and Wei Yaoshe sent the specimen to the Liuzhou City Culture Bureau for forwarding to the Guangxi Provincial Museum in Nanning. The discovered mandible fossil was recently identified by Professor Pei Wenzhong, head of the Guangxi Working Team sent by the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to Guangxi to investigate animal fossils in caves, as the mandible of "Gigantopithecus," or "Giant Human." The mandible fossil has six teeth preserved on the left side, from the lateral incisor to the second molar, and five teeth preserved on the right side, from the canine to the second molar.
    "Gigantopithecus" was discovered in 1935 by the Dutch paleontologist G.H.R. von Koenigswald. He bought three huge teeth from "dragon bones" in a Chinese pharmacy, believing that they belonged to the teeth of an ancient ape very close to humans, and thus named this huge animal "Gigantopithecus." Later, the American paleoanthropologist Franz Weidenreich re-studied Koenigswald's materials and believed that the teeth of this huge animal should belong to the teeth of an ape-man, so he renamed "Gigantopithecus" to "Giant Human." From this time on, whether these huge teeth in the "dragon bones" of Chinese pharmacies were human or ape became a long-standing unresolved question in the world of science.
    Last year, the Vertebrate Paleontology Expedition of the Chinese Academy of Sciences discovered 47 such teeth in the "dragon bones" of Chinese medicine material purchasing stations in Guangxi and Guangzhou, and also discovered three teeth in the Black Cave of Nalong Township, Lanxu District, Daxin County. This solved the problem of the original geology and age of these animal fossils. Accordingly, it is no longer a problem that it is an animal from the Middle Pleistocene geological age (about 400,000 to 600,000 years ago). However, at that time, because the teeth used for research were all separate and scattered, it was impossible to know how the teeth were arranged. Therefore, it was not possible to determine whether this animal was human or ape. Now, the mandible discovered by Tan Xiuhuai in Liucheng provides important material for solving this problem. From the fact that the intact teeth on the mandible are arranged in an outward arc shape rather than in a straight line, and that its canine teeth are not conical in shape that protrude above the other tooth surfaces, it seems that this huge animal is likely to belong to the category of "human" rather than the category of "ape." In this way, the question of whether "Gigantopithecus" is human or ape can also be expected to be resolved.
    Because this specimen is important, the Vertebrate Paleontology Expedition of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has changed its planned work schedule. The captain, Professor Pei Wenzhong, led the entire team of 20 staff members to Liuzhou City on January 16 and then to Liucheng, preparing to excavate again in the Xiaoyan Cave of Lengzhai Mountain, Changchao Township, in order to obtain more materials about "Gigantopithecus."
    In view of the fact that farmer Tan Xiuhuai discovered and donated important scientific specimens, the Guangxi Provincial Culture Bureau intends to give Tan Xiuhuai material rewards. Comrade Wei Yaoshe of the Luoman People's Bank, who loves cultural relics and has made many trips to preserve this precious specimen, will also be awarded a banner of "Love for Cultural Relics" by the Provincial Culture Bureau.

### 广西发现“巨猿”的下颚骨  这种巨大的灵长类可能是人类的一种

    广西发现“巨猿”的下颚骨
    这种巨大的灵长类可能是人类的一种
    本报讯　据广西日报记者张谷报道：广西省柳城县长朝乡新社中村农民覃秀怀，在这个村附近的楞寨山硝岩洞中，发现了“巨猿”的下颚骨。这个发现将有可能解决“巨猿”究竟是“猿”还是“人”的问题，在科学上有重大价值。
    去年5月至9月间，覃秀怀由于积肥，在楞寨山硝岩洞中，发现了岩泥中有许多兽骨化石。他知道这是中药药材中的“龙骨”，便选出了一百多斤送到柳江县洛满供销社去售卖。当时供销社已经根据去年4月上旬国务院所发关于在农业生产建设中保护文物的通知，停止了收购。在覃秀怀售卖“龙骨”时，洛满人民银行营业所主任韦耀社正在那里。韦耀社见“龙骨”里有一个有牙的下颚骨，以为可能有研究价值，便动员覃秀怀捐献给政府。覃秀怀同意了，便由韦耀社将这个标本送到柳州市文化局转送到南宁广西省博物馆。这块被发现的下颚骨化石，最近经中国科学院古脊椎动物研究室派来广西调查研究山洞里动物化石的广西工作队负责人裴文中教授鉴定，就是“巨猿”或者叫“巨人”的下颚。这个下颚骨化石，左边保存了由侧门齿到第二臼齿的六个牙，右边保存了由犬齿到第二臼齿的五个牙。
    “巨猿”是在1935年时荷兰古生物学家孔尼华发现的。他从中国药店的“龙骨”中买到三枚巨大牙齿，认为它们是属于一种古代很接近于人的一种猿的牙齿，因而把这种巨大动物定名为“巨猿”。后来美国的古人类学家魏敦瑞根据孔尼华的材料，重加研究，则认为这种巨大动物的牙齿，应当属于一种猿人的牙齿，于是他将“巨猿”改名为“巨人”。从这个时候起，中国药店的“龙骨”里的这种巨大的牙齿，究竟是人的还是猿的，就成了世界科学上一个长期没有解决的问题。
    去年中国科学院古脊椎动物考察队在广西和广州的药材收购站的“龙骨”中，曾发现了四十七枚这种牙齿，又在大新县榄墟区那隆乡的黑洞中，发现了三枚牙齿。这样就解决了这种动物化石的原生地质及其年代的问题。据此，它是地质年代上的更新纪中期（距今约有四十至六十万年）的一种动物，这已不成问题了。但是，当时由于据以研究的牙齿都是单独零星的，牙齿如何排列还无法知道。因此，尚不能确定这种动物究竟是人还是猿。现在覃秀怀在柳城发现的下颚骨，对解决这个问题提供了重要的材料。从下颚骨上完好的牙齿是排列成向外的弧形而不是排列成一条直线，以及它的犬齿不是高出其他牙面的锥形的样子看来，这种巨大的动物，很可能是属于“人”的范畴，而不是属于“猿”的范畴。这样，“巨猿”究竟是人还是猿的问题，也将可望获得解决了。
    中国科学院古脊椎动物考察队因为这个标本重要，已改变了预定的工作计划，由队长裴文中教授率领全队二十个工作人员，于1月16日赶赴柳州市，转赴柳城，准备在长朝乡楞寨山的硝岩洞中，再事发掘，以期得到更多有关“巨猿”的材料。
    广西省文化局鉴于农民覃秀怀发现并捐献了重要的科学标本，拟对覃秀怀予以实物的奖励。洛满人民银行的韦耀社同志，爱护文物，并为保存这件珍贵标本奔走多次，省文化局也拟奖以“爱护文物”的锦旗。
