    Save Steel! Save Coal! Save Timber!
    Use Less Metal to Build More Machines
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) How to use the least amount of steel material to create more and better products in machinery factories hinges on mobilizing technical personnel to improve product design and process regulations. The practices of many machinery factories in Shenyang prove this point.
    Designers from five factories, including Shenyang Transformer Factory and Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory, have reviewed the design drawings of products to be mass-produced this year and found ways to change product structures and component shapes. The Shenyang Transformer Factory proposed technical solutions to modify the designs of seventeen old products, and the metal materials saved this year are estimated to be enough to increase the production of fifty-eight 100 kVA transformers. Designers at the Shenyang Air Compressor Factory modified the transmission device of a 300-horsepower air compressor, reducing the machine's weight by more than 2,000 kilograms and improving its performance.
    Process personnel from more than ten factories, including Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory and Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory, are like meticulous tailors, maximizing the utilization rate of steel materials. The process personnel at the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory decided to implement nesting and material utilization, reduce processing allowances, and improve processing procedures and methods when producing 1K366 hexagonal lathes. The steel materials saved this year are estimated to be enough to increase the production of 160 of these lathes. Technical personnel at the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory and Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory have studied and learned advanced experiences such as flashless forging, which has also saved a significant amount of steel.
    Burning Less Coal Can Still Keep Warm
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Beijing held a coal conservation experience exchange meeting on the 14th. Many facts presented at the meeting illustrated that it is entirely possible to save 15% to 25% of coal used for heating while ensuring warmth.
    The exchange meeting was jointly organized by the State Council's Government Offices Administration Bureau and the Beijing State-owned Coal Industry Building Materials Company. Over a thousand management personnel and stoker workers from government agencies, organizations, troops, and schools attended.
    The experience of the Ministry of Communications office building in conserving coal attracted everyone's attention. This unit saved a total of 218,000 catties of coal in the recent fifty-four days, a 31.37% reduction compared to the state-stipulated standard. Their main experiences were: leadership's emphasis, strict control of coal consumption, formulation of specific plans, and weekly inspections. The Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Communications and the Chief of the General Affairs Department often went to the boiler room to understand the coal burning situation. Management personnel also paid special attention to the education of the stoker workers. Every worker understood the importance of conserving coal and created many good methods.
    The management personnel of Beijing Normal University introduced their experience in converting furnaces to burn inferior bituminous coal. He said that as long as it is burned properly, bituminous coal has many benefits: it is easy to ignite, saves wood, and warms up quickly; at the same time, it does not explode, burns steadily, and can also be mixed with soil and shaken into coal balls for use. Now everyone is used to and happy to burn it.
    Huge Potential for Saving Timber in Mines
    (This newspaper dispatch) Engineering technicians and workers of the Wangfeng, Lifeng, No. 39, and Xiaomacun coal mines affiliated with the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, have formulated twenty-three technical measures that can save large quantities of timber, based on specific conditions. Raising the timber recovery rate by just 20% alone can save wood props worth more than 600,000 yuan this year. Currently, technical personnel in various mines are helping workers learn to use timber substitutes. They used bamboo mats as false roofs to replace a large number of wooden boards, and used more than 7,500 bamboo roof beams to support more than 1,400 pressure-resistant sheds. They have also decided to use more than 10,000 concrete sheds this year in the geologically stable areas of the four mines, based on the results of regional technical assessments. Metal columns, iron beams and other substitutes are also being promoted. The Jiaozuo Mining Bureau has specifically established and organized several specialized processing plants to ensure the quality of these substitutes.
    These four mines also use improved management methods to save timber, achieving appropriate use of materials according to local conditions and making the best use of all materials, eliminating the phenomenon of using large materials for small purposes and good materials for poor purposes. Each mine inventoried the stored timber and worked with coal miners and technicians to study how to use the more than 5,000 cubic meters of pit props that had been stockpiled for a long time due to being too thick or too thin. In the past, material supply personnel believed that their task was to receive and issue materials, and to give whatever production needed. Now they have begun to study whether the use of timber is rational. For example, Wangfeng Coal Mine used good wood props to cut railroad ties every year in the past. When replacing new railroad ties in December last year and January this year, the material management personnel purchased some miscellaneous wood from nearby rural areas to replace more than 4,000 good wood props. These four mines have also universally established and improved cost accounting systems, strictly controlled pit prop distribution procedures, and improved the accuracy of pit prop usage plans; and established a timber conservation reward system to encourage workers to improve pit prop recovery rates and reuse times under safe conditions.

    节约钢铁！节约煤炭！节约木材！
    用更少的金属造出更多的机器
    据新华社讯　在机械工厂里如何使用最少的钢铁材料造出更多更好的产品，关键在于发动技术人员改进产品设计和工艺规程。沈阳很多机械工厂的做法证明了这一点。
    沈阳变压器厂和沈阳矿山机器厂等五个工厂的设计人员，对今年大批生产的产品设计图纸，都进行了复查，找出了改变产品结构和部件形状的方法。沈阳变压器厂提出了修改十七种老产品的设计技术方案，今年节约下来的金属材料，估计足够增产五十八台容量有一百千伏安的变压器。沈阳空气压缩机厂的设计人员，修改了三百马力空气压缩机的传动装置，使机器体重减轻两千多公斤，并且提高了性能。
    沈阳风动工具厂和沈阳第三机床厂等十多个工厂的工艺人员，都像细心的裁缝一样，把钢铁材料的利用率提到最高程度。沈阳第三机床厂工艺人员决定在生产一K三六六角车床的时候，实行套裁、套料，减少加工余量，改进加工的工序和方法，今年节约下来的钢铁材料估计可以增产一百六十台这种机床。沈阳第一机床厂和沈阳风动工具厂的技术人员研究学习了无毛边锻造等先进经验，也节约了大量钢铁。
    少烧煤同样可以保暖
    据新华社讯　北京14日举行节约煤炭经验交流会。会上提出的许多事实，说明在保证取暖的前提下，节省15％到25％的烤火用煤，是完全可能的。
    这次交流会由国务院机关事务管理局和北京市国营煤业建筑器材公司联合组织，到会的有机关、团体、部队、学校一千多个管理人员和司炉工人。
    交通部办公大楼节约用煤的经验引起了大家的注意。这个单位在最近的五十四天中，共节省了二十一万八千多斤煤，比国家规定标准降低了31.37％。他们的主要经验是：领导重视，严格控制烧煤量，订出具体计划，每周进行检查。交通部办公厅主任和总务处处长常到锅炉房了解烧煤情况，管理人员对司炉工人的教育也特别注意，每个工人都了解节约煤炭的重要意义，创造了许多好方法。
    北京师范学院的管理人员介绍了火炉改烧劣质烟煤的经验。他说，只要烧用得法，烟煤也有很多好处：容易生火、省木材、取暖快；同时不爆、耐烧，还能掺土摇成煤球使用。现在大家已经习惯并且乐于烧用了。
    矿井里节省木材的潜力雄厚
    本报讯　焦作矿务局所属王封、李封、三十九号井和小马村四个煤矿的工程技术人员和广大职工，根据具体条件，制定了二十三项能够大量节约木材的技术措施。仅是把坑木回收率提高20％一项，今年即可节省价值六十多万元的木柱。目前各矿技术人员正在帮助工人学习使用木柱代用品。他们用竹笆做假顶代替了大批木板，又用了七千五百多根竹质棚梁，支好了一千四百多架耐压棚。他们还根据地区技术鉴定的情况，决定今年在四个矿的地压稳定地区，使用混凝土棚一万多架。金属柱、铁质梁等代用品也正在推行。焦作矿务局专门建立和组织了几个专业加工厂，以保证这些代用品的质量。
    这四个矿还用改进管理工作的办法来节约木材，做到因地用材、材尽其能，杜绝大材小用、好材劣用的现象。各矿都清点了存放的木材，把清点出来的由于偏粗偏细而积压很久的五千多立方公尺坑木，和采煤工人、技术员共同研究如何使用。过去，材料供应人员认为他们的任务就是收收发发，生产上需要啥就给啥，现在他们开始研究木材使用上是否做到合理。例如王封煤矿历年换铁道枕木都是用好木柱裁成的，去年12月和今年1月换新枕木时，材料管理人员就到附近农村收买了一些杂木，代替了四千多根好木柱。这四个矿还普遍建立和健全了成本核算制度，严格控制了坑木发放手续，提高了坑木使用计划的准确性；并且建立了节约木材的奖励制度，鼓励工人在安全条件下，提高坑木回收率和复用次数。　　　　（据河南日报）
