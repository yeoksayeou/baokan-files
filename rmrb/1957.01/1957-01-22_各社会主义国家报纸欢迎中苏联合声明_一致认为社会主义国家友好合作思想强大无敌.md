Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Newspapers in socialist countries warmly welcomed the Sino-Soviet joint statement.

    The "Rodong Sinmun" and "Minju Choson" of Korea prominently published the full text of the Sino-Soviet joint statement on January 20th. "Minju Choson" published an editorial on January 20th titled "Great Friendship, Unbreakable Unity," pointing out that the strengthening and development of friendly cooperation between the people of the Soviet Union and China is an extremely important factor in further strengthening the unity and strength of the socialist camp, and in uniting all peace-loving people to carry out the struggle for peace. The editorial concluded by saying that the Korean people, whether in the past or now, will strengthen unity with the people of all countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and China, and bravely advance for the victory of the common cause and for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
    The Vietnamese "Nhân Dân" published an editorial on January 20th, saying that the visit of the Chinese government delegation to the Soviet Union, Poland, and Hungary has further consolidated the unity among socialist countries. The editorial pointed out that in the fierce and protracted struggle between the forces of peace and progress and the forces of war, strengthening the unity among socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is the most important factor in consolidating the socialist cause and also a guarantee for the independence of all nations and the realization of peace.
    A commentary in the Polish "Trybuna Ludu" on January 20th stated that this joint statement was signed at a time when the international situation had once again become complicated after major achievements had been made in easing international tensions. Therefore, this statement is of great significance. The friendship between these two major socialist countries and their close cooperation are clearly a guarantee of world peace; the reaffirmation in this statement of the Leninist principles in the relations between socialist countries will have a very positive impact on the development of relations between socialist countries, thereby promoting the strengthening of the entire socialist camp.
    The Czechoslovak "Rudé Právo" wrote in its editorial: The Sino-Soviet joint statement and the results of the talks held by the Chinese government delegation in Warsaw and Budapest powerfully demonstrate the great strength of the ideas of proletarian internationalism and friendly cooperation among socialist countries.
    The Bulgarian "Rabotnichesko Delo," in a commentary titled "The Victory of the Great Sino-Soviet Friendship," said that the People's Republic of Bulgaria is an indivisible part of the strong, unified, and unbreakable socialist camp that is forever united in friendship, and it heartily rejoices at this new and vivid manifestation of the further consolidation of friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.
    The central newspapers of Romania published the full text of the Sino-Soviet joint statement on January 19th under large headlines. "Scînteia" pointed out in its editorial titled "The Unbreakable Unity of Socialist Countries" that the documents issued after Premier Zhou Enlai's talks with the leaders of the Soviet Union, Poland, Germany, and Hungary, especially the Sino-Soviet joint statement, are of great significance not only for the lives of socialist countries but also for the entire international situation. The solidarity of the socialist family of nations contributes to the consolidation of peace and the uniting of all progressive forces in a common struggle to safeguard peace and ensure the security of all peoples.
    The German Democratic Republic's "Neues Deutschland" published a detailed summary of the Sino-Soviet joint statement on its international page on January 20th.
