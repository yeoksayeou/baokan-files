Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Mass flood control and drainage work in our country has achieved great results in recent years. According to statistics from the flood control and drainage work symposium that concluded today, the benefited area of flood control and drainage projects completed by eleven provinces, including Henan, Hebei, Hunan, and the Northeast region, from 1949 to 1955 reached more than 58 million mu. In 1956, ten provinces across the country implemented engineering and agricultural measures for flood control and drainage on more than 40 million mu of cultivated land. The implementation of these works has played a significant role in reducing the area affected by floods, mitigating disaster situations, and ensuring increased agricultural production.

Because the flood prevention and drainage facilities and capacity in many regions of our country are currently insufficient, the area affected by floods each year is still very large, and it has also caused much loss to agricultural production. In view of this situation, the symposium believes that further improving flood control and drainage work is an extremely important task in the current farmland water conservancy construction work. However, flood control and drainage is a far-reaching and extremely complex task. It must be carried out on the basis of a comprehensive water conservancy plan, combined with river management and drought prevention irrigation, and according to the different natural and production conditions in various places, as well as the historical drainage relationships between upstream and downstream areas. This work should be carried out in a way that small interests are subordinate to large interests, local interests are subordinate to overall interests, and adapting to local conditions.

Farmers in our country's riverside, lakeside, and low-lying areas have very rich experience in fighting waterlogging. Therefore, the meeting especially emphasized conducting in-depth investigations and research, conscientiously summarizing this experience, and fully mobilizing and organizing the masses to carry out flood control and drainage work. When promoting flood control and drainage experience, cadres and the masses can also be organized to visit and learn from each other in provinces and regions with similar natural conditions.

The symposium believes that improving and fully utilizing the potential of existing drainage facilities is also an important task at present. Because there are many types of flood control and drainage projects and they are scattered, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to do a good job in management and maintenance. The management of existing pumping stations must also be strengthened to reduce operating costs and improve mechanical utilization.

The symposium also pointed out that the construction of general mass flood control and drainage projects must continue to implement the principle of "run by the people with government assistance," relying on the collective strength of agricultural cooperatives. For larger projects with complex technologies, such as gates and dams, the state should invest in and organize them in a planned manner.

The symposium systematically summarized the specific experiences of flood control and drainage in plain low-lying areas and along the river and lake embankments. It also studied the specific leadership issues in strengthening flood control and drainage work.

This symposium was convened by the Ministry of Water Conservancy on January 3rd in Beijing. More than 60 representatives from fourteen provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Tianjin, participated in the symposium.

### 防涝排水工作座谈会提出  加强群众性的防涝排水工作

    防涝排水工作座谈会提出
    加强群众性的防涝排水工作
    新华社7日讯　我国群众性的防涝排水工作几年来取得了很大成绩。据今天结束的防涝排水工作座谈会的统计，仅河南、河北、湖南和东北地区等十一个省从1949年到1955年所完成的防涝排水工程的受益面积就达五千八百多万亩，而在1956年，全国又有十个省在四千多万亩耕地上进行了防涝排水的工程措施和农业措施。这些工作的进行，对减少涝灾面积和减轻灾情以及保证农业增产起了很大作用。
    由于目前我国许多地区防洪排涝的设施和能力不足，因此每年涝灾的面积仍然是很大的，并且也给农业生产造成了许多损失。鉴于这一情况，座谈会认为，进一步做好防涝排水工作，是当前农田水利建设工作中一项极为重要的任务。但是防涝排水又是一项牵连面广，极为复杂的工作，必需在水利工作全面规划的基础上，结合江河治理和防旱灌溉并根据各地不同的自然条件和生产条件以及上下游之间历史上的排水关系等特点，本着小利服从大利、局部服从整体，因地制宜地来开展这项工作。
    我国沿江、滨湖和低洼等地区的农民，和涝渍作斗争是有很丰富的经验的，因此会议特别强调深入调查研究，认真总结这方面的经验，充分发动和组织群众来进行防涝排水工作。在推广防涝排水经验的时候，还可在自然条件相似的省和地区之间，组织干部和群众互相参观和学习。
    座谈会认为改善和充分发挥现有排水设施的潜力，也是当前的一项重要任务。由于防涝排水工程种类多和分散，因此，还必须发动群众做好管理养护工作。对现有的抽水机站的管理工作也必须加强，以达到降低经营成本，提高机械利用率的目的。
    座谈会还指出，一般群众性的防涝排水工程的兴建，必须继续贯彻“民办公助”的原则，依靠农业社的集体力量来进行，对工程较大、技术复杂的闸、坝等工程，则由国家有计划的投资举办。
    座谈会对平原低洼地区、沿江滨湖圩垸地区的防涝排水的具体经验都进行了系统的总结。对加强防涝排水工作的具体领导问题也作了研究。
    这个座谈会是水利部1月3日在北京召开的。参加座谈会的有江苏、浙江、安徽、山东、河北、河南、江西、湖南、湖北、广东、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江和天津等十四个省、市的代表共六十多人。
