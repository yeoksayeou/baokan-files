    Workers at the state-owned Wafangdian Ball Bearing Factory passed a resolution at the factory's Fourth Advanced Producers' Conference on the 20th to promote methods for saving steel throughout the factory. The resolution includes two methods for saving steel: one is to use a press to cold-cut ball bearing steel to reduce steel loss, and the other is to use shaped dies to forge ball bearing rings to reduce the amount of turning in the next process. These two methods for saving steel were successfully tested by engineer Jin Kaitai, along with staff from relevant departments and workshop workers, on January 15 this year.
    The method of cold-cutting ball bearing steel with a press involves placing the ball bearing steel on a friction press and cutting it without heating and annealing. Using this method to cut steel not only eliminates the labor, fuel, and other costs incurred in the past heating and annealing process, as well as the loss of steel after heat treatment, but also avoids the phenomenon of steel loss from the tool edge when cutting with a lathe in the past. Using this method saves an average of 3% of steel per ball bearing cut compared to the past.
    The method of using shaped dies to forge bearing rings to reduce the amount of turning in the next process mainly involves changing the initial die to a shaped die, so that the product is formed in one forging. According to tests, after using shaped dies for forging, each bearing ring only needs to be turned once to become a finished product. Its main benefit is that it reduces the amount of lathe turning and avoids steel loss. According to preliminary calculations by the factory, simply by promoting this method, the entire factory can save seventy tons of ball bearing steel this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    瓦房店滚珠轴承厂职工的创造 
    国营瓦房店滚珠轴承厂在20日召开的全厂第四届先进生产者大会上，通过了一项在全厂推广节省钢材办法的决议。决议包括两种节省钢材办法，一种是用压力机冷切滚珠钢来减少钢材损耗，另一种是用成型胎锻造滚珠轴承圈来减少下道工序车削量。这两种节省钢材的办法，是由工程师金开泰同有关科室职员、车间工人在今年1月15日试验成功的。
    压力冷切滚珠钢材的办法，是把滚珠钢材放在摩擦压力机上，不用加热退火处理就可以切断。使用这种方法切断钢材，不但能免去过去加热退火处理过程中所耗费的人工、燃料等费用和钢材加热处理后的损耗，同时也避免了过去用车床切断时刀口损耗钢材的现象。使用这种方法平均每切断一个滚珠轴承能比过去节省3％的钢材。
    用成型胎锻造轴承圈来减少下道工序车削量的办法，主要是把过去初型胎改变为成型胎，使产品一次锻造成型。据试验，改用成型胎锻造以后，每个轴承圈只要车一次就成为成品了。它的好处主要是减少了车床车削量，避免钢材损耗。据这个厂的初步计算，单是推广这一项办法，全厂今年就可以节省七十吨滚珠钢。　（新华社）
