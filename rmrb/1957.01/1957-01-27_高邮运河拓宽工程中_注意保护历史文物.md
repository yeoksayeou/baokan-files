    Pay Attention to Protecting Historical Relics During the Gaoyou Canal Widening Project

    (Our Dispatch) There are two ancient pagodas in Gaoyou, Jiangsu, one called the East Pagoda and the other called the West Pagoda. According to research, the West Pagoda was built during the reign of Emperor Xizong of the Tang Dynasty, dating back one thousand and eighty-three to one thousand and sixty-nine years. It is a brick-built, imitation-wood structure, square, and seven stories high. When the Gaoyou Canal widening project began planning, the West Pagoda was located within the engineering scope of the dike to be demolished. In order to preserve cultural relics and historical sites, the Gaoyou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Committee proposed to the Yangzhou Special District Gaoyou Canal Widening Project Headquarters to retain the West Pagoda. After many studies, the headquarters has now decided to retain it, and therefore made a revised route design for the canal near the West Pagoda.

    高邮运河拓宽工程中
    注意保护历史文物
    本报讯　江苏高邮有两个古塔，一个叫东塔，一个叫西塔。据考证，西塔为唐禧宗时创建，距今已有一千零八十三年至一千零六十九年的历史。它是砖砌仿木结构，方形，七层。当高邮运河拓宽工程开始规划时，西塔正处在被拆堤的工程范围以内。中共高邮县委和县人民委员会为了保存文物古迹，向扬州专区高邮运河拓宽工程指挥部提出保留西塔的建议。经过多次研究，指挥部现已决定予以保留，因而作了西塔附近运河改线设计。（素材）
