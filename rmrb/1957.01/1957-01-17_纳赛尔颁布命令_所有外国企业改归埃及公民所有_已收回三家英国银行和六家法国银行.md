    Nasser Issues Decree
    All Foreign Enterprises to be Transferred to Egyptian Citizens
    Three British Banks and Six French Banks Have Been Recovered
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 16th - Egyptian President Nasser issued a decree on the 15th, stipulating that all foreign banks, insurance companies, and trading institutions in Egypt must be transferred to Egyptian citizens. These foreign-owned enterprises must be converted into Egyptian joint-stock companies, "and their shares should be wholly owned, nominally and in reality, by citizens of Egyptian descent."
    The decree prohibits all banks, insurance companies, and trading institutions not wholly owned by Egyptian citizens from operating in Egypt.
    The decree also stipulates that agents of foreign companies who have not carried out special registration, or who are not Egyptian joint-stock companies, or who are not nationals born in Egypt, may not conduct business.
    In explaining these decrees, Finance Minister Kaissouny said that for banks and companies of enemy countries, these decrees would take effect immediately. For banks and companies of friendly countries, a grace period of five years would be given to allow these enterprises to gradually adapt to the new regulations. He also said that in order not to harm the interests of certain individuals or companies acting as agents due to the provisions of this law, the government has decided to grant a period of five years, during which they can gradually wind down their business.
    Kaissouny said that the government's reason for passing these decrees was due to "the destructive activities of enemy banks against the Egyptian economy." He said that although the enemy banks that were sealed after the French, British, and Israeli invasion of Egypt had only "two million Egyptian pounds of paid-up capital," they could utilize the deposits of Egyptians in these banks, amounting to 70 to 100 million Egyptian pounds. Kaissouny said that these enemy banks, after manipulating these huge sums of Egyptian funds, could damage the Egyptian economy according to any orders they received from London or Paris.
    He said that after Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal in July last year, French banks in Egypt deliberately did not issue the cotton mortgage loans they usually gave to farmers, and stopped issuing all loans to Egyptian industry and commerce. Their purpose was clearly to cause cotton prices to plummet and to adversely affect Egypt's overall economic situation.
    It is reported that, according to the newly promulgated law, three British banks and six French banks in Egypt have already been converted into Egyptian joint-stock companies on the 15th.

### 纳赛尔颁布命令  所有外国企业改归埃及公民所有  已收回三家英国银行和六家法国银行

    纳赛尔颁布命令
    所有外国企业改归埃及公民所有
    已收回三家英国银行和六家法国银行
    新华社开罗16日电　埃及总统纳赛尔15日颁布法令，规定所有在埃及的外国银行、保险公司和贸易机构必须改归埃及公民所有，这些外国公民所有的企业，都得改为埃及股份公司，“它们的股票应该全部在名义上和实际上为埃及血统的公民所有”。
    法令禁止一切非埃及公民所有的银行、保险公司和贸易机构在埃及营业。
    法令还规定，外国公司的代理人如果没有进行特别的登记，如果不是埃及的股份公司或者是在埃及出生的国民，就不得经营业务。
    财政部长凯舒尼在解释这些法令时说，对于敌国的银行和公司，这些法令立即生效，对于友好国家的银行和公司，将给以五年的宽限，使这些企业能逐步适应新的法令的规定。他还说，为了不使这项法律的规定损害某些担任代理人的个人或者公司的利益，政府决定给予五年的期限，使他们可以在这期间内逐步结束业务。
    凯舒尼说，政府通过这些法令的原因是由于“敌国银行对埃及经济进行破坏活动”。他说，在法、英、以色列进攻埃及后被查封的敌国银行虽然只有“两百万英镑的已缴资本”，但是它们可以利用的埃及人存在这些银行中的存款达七千万到一亿埃镑。凯舒尼说，这些敌国银行操纵了这些巨额的埃及人资金后，能够根据它们接到的从伦敦或巴黎来的任何命令来损害埃及的经济。
    他说，在去年7月埃及把苏伊士运河收归国有以后，在埃及的法国银行故意不发放它们惯常给予农民的棉花抵押贷款，并且停止对埃及工商业发放一切贷款，它们的目的显然是要使棉花价格暴跌，使埃及的总的经济情况受到不利影响。
    据悉，根据新颁布的法律，15日已经有在埃及的三家英国银行和六家法国银行改为埃及股份公司。
