Xinhua News Agency, January 11th: Many factories and enterprises in Beijing have already put forward their targets for increasing production and practicing economy this year.

    The draft production plan for 1957, already compiled by the Liulihe Cement Plant, requires cement production to increase by 15,000 tons compared to last year. The preliminary plan proposed to all employees of the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory is to save 30,000 kilograms more cotton this year than last year. The Beijing Timber Factory and Guanghua Timber Factory have set a target of saving more than 11,000 cubic meters of timber throughout the year. Before formulating the annual plan for increasing production and practicing economy, the state-owned Beijing Winery first formulated a plan for the first quarter, increasing production by more than 170 tons of wine and reducing costs by more than 41,000 yuan.
    The employees of some factories and enterprises in Beijing have also come up with many ways to increase production and practice economy. In order to save raw materials, four state-owned machinery factories, including Beijing People's Machinery Factory, have revised the designs of 22 products while ensuring quality. The Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory changed the driver part of the horse-drawn harvester from iron to wood, so that the steel originally used to produce ten horse-drawn harvesters could be used to produce eleven. In early January, Liu Jisheng, a retired veteran worker from the Beijing Water Company, and other veteran workers provided more than 20 clues about underground water pipes buried over 20,000 meters, which were laid during the enemy-puppet period and have never been used. The Beijing Water Company has established a pipe removal engineering team to excavate these underground water pipes at various locations.

    一年之计在于春　增产节约重力行
    北京部分工厂迅速订出今年增产节约指标
    据新华社11日讯　北京市不少工厂企业已经提出今年增产节约的指标。
    琉璃河水泥厂已经编制出的1957年生产计划草案，要求水泥的产量比去年增加一万五千吨。国营北京第一棉纺织厂向全厂职工提出的初步方案，今年将比去年多节约三万公斤棉花。北京木材厂和光华木材厂，订出了全年节约一万一千多立方公尺木材的指标。国营北京酿酒厂在没有订出全年增产节约计划以前，先订出了第一季度的计划，增产一百七十多吨酒、降低成本四万一千多元。
    北京的一些工厂企业的职工们还想出了很多增产节约的办法。北京人民机器厂等四个国营机械工厂为了节约原材料，在保证质量的原则下修改了二十二种产品设计。北京农业机械厂把马拉收割机驾辕部分由铁制改为木制，使原来生产十台马拉收割机的钢材可以生产十一台。1月上旬，北京市自来水公司退休了的老工人刘吉升和其他老工人，提供了二十多处埋有两万多公尺地下水管的线索，这些钢管和铸铁管，都是敌伪时期铺下的，一直没有利用。北京市自来水公司已经成立了撤管工程队，到各个地点挖取这批地下水管。
