	The Saar Treaty—A Dirty Deal

	According to the Franco-West German Saar Treaty, the Saar was politically incorporated into West Germany on January 1 this year.

	The Saar issue has long been a point of contention between West German and French monopolists. The Saar was originally German territory. It contains rich coal mines and possesses a large steel industry. After World War II, France politically and economically controlled the Saar, while vigorously developing the coal and steel industry in the region. In 1955, the Saar's coal production reached 17.3 million tons, and steel production was 3.2 million tons, which allowed France to maintain a certain balance with West Germany in the "European Coal and Steel Community." In addition, the Saar imported at least 100,000 tons of grain, 35,000 tons of meat, and other agricultural products from France annually, giving France a trade surplus of 50 billion francs with the Saar each year; moreover, the Saar's exports were fully capable of offsetting the huge deficit in trade between other franc zones and West Germany. With the recovery of the West German economy and the increasingly consolidated position of monopoly organizations, West Germany has tried its best to regain control of the Saar. Thus, the contradiction between France and West Germany on the Saar issue has become increasingly acute.

	In October 1954, in order to get France to sign the "Paris Agreements," the West German government signed an agreement with France to "Europeanize" the Saar. However, in October 1955, the residents of the Saar voted against the "European Statute" that violated their interests. In the parliamentary elections in December, pro-French parties were defeated. Under these circumstances, France could no longer keep the Saar in its hands.

	From February of last year, France and West Germany held a series of negotiations. France had to agree to give up control of the Saar, but it tried its best to make this deal with West Germany on more favorable terms. During the negotiations, France demanded the construction of the Moselle Canal in West Germany to reduce the cost of transporting Lorraine iron ore to the Ruhr; at the same time, it wanted to obtain cheap coking coal from the Ruhr to change the unfavorable situation of the French metallurgical industry. In addition, it also demanded to continue mining Saar coal and maintain its equity in large enterprises in the Saar, as well as maintain its trade level with the Saar. Of course, West German monopolists strongly opposed these demands of the French monopolists. Thus, Mollet and Adenauer, Pinay and Brentano constantly quarreled over these issues, causing the negotiations to fall into a deadlock many times.

	It was not until October 27 last year that France and West Germany made this dirty deal. Pinay and Brentano signed the Saar Treaty in Luxembourg. The treaty stipulates that the Saar will be politically incorporated into West Germany on January 1, 1957, and its economic incorporation into West Germany will be gradually carried out within the next three years, and completed before December 31, 1959; France will obtain 90 million tons of coal from the Saar in twenty-five years, and currently it owns all the Saar's coal resources; West Germany agreed to build the Moselle Canal and bear one-third of all expenses; in addition, West Germany will give France an undisclosed amount of money.

	After the signing of the Saar Treaty, French and West German officials vigorously publicized that the dispute between France and West Germany had been resolved, and that the two countries would cooperate better in the future. However, this deliberately optimistic tone cannot hide the conflict of interests between the two sides. In fact, this temporary compromise between France and West Germany on the Saar issue will only deepen the contradiction between French and West German monopolists. After the Saar is incorporated into West Germany, West Germany's share of the coal and steel industry's potential compared with France will change from 128 to 71 to 145 to 54; moreover, France's share of steel production in the "European Coal and Steel Community" will drop to 22%, thereby losing the priority voting rights enjoyed by member states that control at least 25% of steel production. The strengthening of West Germany's coal and steel industry not only allows West German monopolists to occupy an overwhelming advantage in the "European Coal and Steel Community," but also brings greater threats to France's export trade and overseas investment. In addition, France and West Germany agreed to destroy 40 billion of the 50 billion francs issued by France in the Saar, and recover the remaining 10 billion francs at the official exchange rate, which also caused France to suffer significant losses. After the signing of the Saar Treaty, Parisian journalists were already dissatisfied, talking about how West Germany's concessions on the Saar issue may not be able to compensate for France's losses.

	Under these circumstances, French monopolists will inevitably take various measures to resist the squeeze from West German rivals. In the Saar, because the equity of many coal and steel enterprises is respectively held by French and West German monopolists, the struggle between the two sides for control will become increasingly acute. In organizations such as the "European Coal and Steel Community" and the Western European "Common Market," the infighting and bickering between the two sides will also become increasingly fierce.

	At the same time, for West German monopolists, it is certainly an unpleasant thing for them to pay for the construction of the Moselle Canal for their competitors, and to allow their opponents to continue mining 90 million tons of coal in the Saar in the next 25 years. Although an agreement has been signed on the construction of the Moselle Canal, they can still use some specific details to hinder the construction of the canal, or take some measures after the canal is built to offset the benefits obtained by French steel companies from the canal. Regarding the agreement to allow France to continue mining coal in the future, the British "Economist" magazine pointed out long ago that this will not prevent Germany from mining coal in the French coal mining area, so as to make the operation of French coal mining enterprises difficult. It is foreseeable that in the future process of economically incorporating the Saar into West Germany, there will be fierce disputes between the two sides.

	The Saar Treaty signed by West Germany and France violated the wishes of the people of the Saar and the German people. As everyone knows, under the current situation of the existence of two Germanys, the Saar issue can only be reasonably resolved with the participation of representatives from both Germanys. Now West Germany and France exclude the participation of the German Democratic Republic and forcibly incorporate the Saar into West Germany, which adds new obstacles to the unification of Germany, and also makes the Saar a military industrial base of West Germany, subject to the constraints of the Atlantic Treaty Group and the domination of the Paris Agreements.

	As early as May of last year, German Democratic Republic Premier Grotewohl wrote to West German Premier Adenauer, pointing out that the two German governments should absorb representatives of the Saar state government to jointly discuss the Saar issue in order to obtain a solution that conforms to the interests of the German nation. After the West German and French governments unilaterally signed the Saar Treaty, the German Democratic Republic issued a statement lodging a solemn protest. The people of the Saar also expressed great dissatisfaction with the Saar Treaty that violated their wishes. Before the special meeting of the Saar parliament to discuss the issue of incorporating the Saar into West Germany began on December 13, the people of the Saar held a demonstration at the parliament building, demanding the cancellation of the Saar Treaty. On December 22, the people of the Saar held a residents' meeting in Dudweiler near Saarbrücken, and passed a resolution opposing the inclusion of the Saar in the North Atlantic Group and the Western European Group.

	In order to solve the Saar issue under the conditions of safeguarding the interests of the German nation and European security, the German Democratic Republic proposes that before the peaceful reunification of Germany is realized, the Saar should be placed in a special position, not be involved in the North Atlantic Group and the Western European Union, and it should be guaranteed that West German or other foreign troops cannot be stationed in this area and that conscription measures cannot be implemented. At the same time, it should also be guaranteed that the living standards of the people in this area will not be lowered, and that the people in this area will be promoted to develop normal free trade and unrestricted cultural exchanges with the German Democratic Republic and West Germany. There is no doubt that this method fully conforms to the wishes of the people of the Saar and the German people, and will be supported by the progressive forces of the world.

### 萨尔条约——一宗肮脏的交易

    萨尔条约——一宗肮脏的交易
    根据法国和西德两国政府签订的西萨尔条约，萨尔已于今年1月1日在政治上并入西德。
    萨尔问题，长期以来一直是西德和法国垄断资本家争执的一个焦点。萨尔原来是德国的领土。它蕴藏有丰富的煤矿，并且拥有巨大的钢铁工业。第二次世界大战以后，法国在政治上和经济上控制了萨尔，同时在这个地区大力发展煤钢工业。1955年萨尔煤的产量达到一千七百三十万吨，钢的产量为三百二十万吨，这就使法国在“欧洲煤钢联营”中同西德保持一定的均势。此外，萨尔每年至少从法国输入十万吨粮食、三万五千吨肉类以及其他农产品，使法国对萨尔贸易的出超每年达五百亿法郎；而且萨尔的出口完全能够弥补其他法郎区对西德贸易上的巨大赤字。随着西德经济的恢复和垄断组织地位的日益巩固，西德就竭力设法恢复对萨尔的控制。于是，法国同西德在萨尔问题上的矛盾就越来越尖锐化了。
    1954年10月西德政府为了使法国同意在“巴黎协定”上签字，曾经同法国签订了一项使萨尔“欧洲化”的协定。但是在1955年10月，萨尔居民投票否决了违反他们利益的“欧洲法规”。紧接着在12月的议会选举中，亲法政党遭到了失败。在这种情况下，法国就无法继续把萨尔留在自己手中了。
    从去年2月开始，法国同西德举行了一系列的谈判。法国不得不同意放弃对萨尔的控制，但是它竭力争取在比较有利的条件下与西德做成这笔交易。在谈判过程中，法国要求在西德境内修建摩塞尔运河，以减低洛林铁砂运往鲁尔的费用；同时使它从鲁尔得到廉价的焦煤，以改变法国冶金工业的不利地位。此外，它还要求继续开采萨尔的煤和维持它在萨尔的大企业的权益，维持它和萨尔的贸易水平。当然，西德垄断资本极力反对法国垄断资本家的这些要求。于是，摩勒同阿登纳、比诺同勃伦塔诺为了这些问题不断地争吵，使谈判多次陷于僵局。
    直到去年10月27日，法国和西德才做成了这一宗肮脏的交易，由比诺和勃伦塔诺在卢森堡签订了萨尔条约。条约规定萨尔在1957年1月1日在政治上并入西德，在经济上并入西德将在今后三年内逐步进行，而在1959年12月31日以前完成；法国将在二十五年中从萨尔获得九千万吨煤，而目前它拥有萨尔全部煤矿资源；西德同意修建摩塞尔运河，并负担全部费用的三分之一；此外，西德还要给法国一笔没有透露数目的款项。
    在萨尔条约签订以后，法国和西德的官方人士就大肆宣传说，法国和西德之间的纠纷已经解决了，今后两国将会更好地合作。但是，这种故作乐观的论调并不能掩盖住双方的利害冲突。事实上，法国和西德这次在萨尔问题上的暂时妥协，只会加深法国同西德的垄断资本家之间的矛盾。萨尔并入西德以后，西德同法国在煤钢工业潜力的比重上将由原来的一百二十八比七十一变为一百四十五比五十四；而且法国在“欧洲煤钢联营”中钢产量的比重将下降到22％，从而失去至少控制钢产量的25％的成员国才能享受的优先投票权。西德煤钢工业力量的加强，不但使西德垄断资本在“欧洲煤钢联营”中可以占有压倒的优势，并且将给法国的出口贸易和海外投资带来更大的威胁。此外，法国和西德同意将法国在萨尔发行的五百亿法郎中毁销四百亿法郎，其余一百亿法郎以官方兑换率收回，这也使法国蒙受了显著的损失。在萨尔条约签订后，巴黎新闻界人士已经不满意地谈论，西德在萨尔问题的一些让步，未必能抵偿法国方面的损失。
    在这种情况下，法国垄断资本家必然要采取各种手段来对抗西德对手的排挤。在萨尔，由于很多煤钢企业的股权分别掌握在法国和西德两国垄断资本的手中，双方争夺控制权的斗争将越来越尖锐。在
  “欧洲煤钢联营”和西欧“共同市场”等组织中，双方勾心斗角的争吵也将越来越激烈。
      同时，对西德垄断资本家来说，要他们出钱为自己的竞争对手来修建摩塞尔运河，和让自己的对手在今后二十五年内再在萨尔开采九千万吨煤，当然也是一件不愉快的事。修建摩塞尔运河的问题虽然已经签订了协议，但是他们还可以利用一些具体细节来阻碍运河的修建，或者在运河建成以后采取一些措施来抵销法国钢铁企业从运河得到的好处。对于让法国今后继续采煤的协议，英国“经济学家”杂志早就指出，这并不能阻挡德国在法国采煤区采煤，以使法国的煤矿企业经营发生困难。可以预料，在今后使萨尔在经济上并入西德的过程中，双方还会有激烈的争吵。
    西德和法国签订的萨尔条约，违背了萨尔人民以及德国人民的愿望。大家知道，在目前两个德国存在的情况下，萨尔问题只有在两个德国的代表参加下才能得到合理的解决。现在西德同法国排斥民主德国的参加，强将萨尔并入西德，就使德国的统一增加了新的障碍，同时也使萨尔成为西德的一个军事工业基地，受到大西洋公约集团的约束和巴黎协定的支配。
    早在去年5月，德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥就曾写信给西德总理阿登纳，指出应该由两个德国的政府，吸收萨尔州政府代表参加，共同讨论萨尔问题，才能获得符合于德国民族利益的解决。在西德和法国政府片面地签订萨尔条约以后，德意志民主共和国又发表声明，提出了严正的抗议。萨尔人民对违反他们愿望的萨尔条约也表示了极大的不满。在12月13日萨尔议会讨论把萨尔并入西德问题的特别会议开始前，萨尔人民在议会大厦举行了示威，要求取消萨尔条约。在12月22日萨尔人民又在萨尔布律根附近的杜德维勒举行各地居民大会，并且通过决议，反对把萨尔划入北大西洋集团和西欧集团范围。
    为了在保障德国民族利益和欧洲安全的条件下解决萨尔问题，德意志民主共和国建议：在德国的和平统一实现以前，萨尔应该被置于一个特殊的地位，不被卷入北大西洋集团和西欧联盟，并且应该保证在这个地区不能驻扎西德或其他外国的军队和实施征兵措施。同时，还应该保证不降低这个地区人民的生活水平，以及促使这个地区的人民同德意志民主共和国和西德发展正常的自由贸易和不受限制的文化交流。毫无疑问，这个办法完全符合于萨尔人民以及德国人民的愿望，并且将得到世界进步力量的支持。
