Mr. Vice-Chairman Peng, dear Chinese guests!

Please allow me to extend my greetings to you not only on behalf of all those present at the banquet, but also on behalf of all the working people of our republic. We are very pleased to be able to welcome representatives of the great Chinese people here. China is great not only because of its large population, but also because of its long revolutionary history against enemies both at home and abroad. As we welcome you here, we cannot help but recall the epic of the Chinese people's struggle, which we followed with great sympathy and concern throughout the past era. Your great revolutionary liberation struggle is a unique example in human history. From the First World War to the Second World War, the Chinese people were constantly fighting until the victory of liberation. We, the old Communists and revolutionary workers, under extremely difficult, isolated, underground work, and the terror of police dogs, were inspired not only by the October Revolution, but also by the great and protracted struggle of the Chinese people.

Now, your objective conditions, political forms, strategic goals of struggle, and the specific construction and development of your socialist society contribute to the development and enrichment of the scientific ideological foundation of socialism. The development of this ideology is an objective need. The diverse forms of socialism under various objective and subjective conditions determine this need.

From the very beginning of our struggle, we developed a special form of political organization—the Liberation Front. It truly embodies the fact that our conscious revolutionary subjective forces are firmly committed to the special forms of socialist relations between people and between producers and the means of production from 1941 until today. We believe that this is the most direct and practical path to realizing the great Leninist vision of socialist relations—that is, the high socialist consciousness of all citizens. Lenin once said that in this case, "an ordinary cook must be able to participate in the management of the state" (we believe that she must participate in the management of the state in any case). We regret that the guests' time here is too short, and that such a short time cannot allow you to fully understand the actual basis of our people's optimism and confidence, that is, to understand the role of the conscious socialist forces of our socialist alliance, which unites the majority of our people. In this organization, the majority of our people are solving specific problems of daily life in a democratic way. The basic goal of daily life is: a free socialist society concentrating all its strength to develop human well-being.

We regret that you have not had the opportunity to understand how a party member plays his role in our social life, that is, his enthusiasm for labor, his loyalty to the people, and his talent. When you visit our Museum of People's Liberation Struggle, you may partially understand where the people's trust in them comes from. We hope that all foreign guests, and especially you, can thoroughly understand our social life. We believe that you will understand us more clearly. We have no desire to impose our social system on others, but we also do not want others to impose their social system on us. Because this form of system belongs to us, because it is now, and will remain in the future, the result of the development of our subjective forces and material conditions. We do not object in the slightest to others critically treating our path, but we would be saddened if someone denied our will and purpose to build socialism. This can only be attributed to the difference in the form of our system from others.

We regret that you have no opportunity to see the unity of our people with the countries and political leaders who adopt foreign and domestic policies that consolidate socialism. The people support these policies because they are in their interests, because they serve to strengthen international peace and cooperation, and because they are conducive to international socialism and human dignity.

My comrades and I believe that the geographical distance will no longer be an obstacle to our deeper understanding in the future. The sympathy generated by our common desire for liberation and socialism in the past will develop and strengthen more rapidly in the future.

May our people and the great Chinese people, under the guidance of their tried and tested, prestigious, and beloved leaders, successfully achieve rapid socialist progress.

To dear friendship and socialist progress,
To the health of Chairman Mao Zedong!

### 在斯洛文尼亚共和国招待宴会上  马林科的讲话

    在斯洛文尼亚共和国招待宴会上
    马林科的讲话亲爱的彭副委员长，亲爱的中国客人们！
    请允许我不仅代表全体出席宴会的人，而且代表我们共和国的全体劳动人民向你们致意。我们能在这里欢迎伟大中国人民的代表感到非常满意。中国不仅因人口众多而伟大，而且还由于它具有多年反对内外敌人的革命历史。当我们在这里欢迎你们的时候，不能不回忆起过去整个时代我们以极大同情关怀的中国人民的斗争的史诗。你们伟大的革命解放斗争是人类历史上仅有的范例。从第一次世界大战到第二次世界大战时期，中国人民一直在进行斗争，直到解放胜利为止。我们这些老共产党员和革命工人在异常艰苦、孤立、地下工作和警犬恐怖的条件下，不仅为十月革命所鼓舞，而且为中国人民伟大的长期奋战所鼓舞。
    现在，你们的客观条件、政治形式、斗争的战略目标以及你们的社会主义社会的具体建设和发展，对发展和丰富科学的社会主义思想基础是有贡献的。这种思想的发展是客观的需要。社会主义在各种客观、主观条件下的多样形式，决定了这种需要。
    我们在斗争一开始就发展了政治组织的特殊形式——解放阵线。它真实地体现了我们自觉的革命主观力量这一事实，肯定地说明从1941年直到今天，我们一直在坚决地致力于人与人之间的和生产者与生产资料之间社会主义关系的特殊形式。我们认为，这是实现伟大的列宁所描写的社会主义关系——即所有公民的高度社会主义觉悟——的最简捷、最合乎实际的道路。列宁曾说，在这种情况下，“一个普通的女厨师也要能够参加国家的管理”（我们认为，在任何场合她都要参加国家管理）。我们感到遗憾的是，客人在这里的时间太短，这样短促的时间不可能使你们完全了解我们人民的乐观主义和信心的实际基础，也就是了解我们团结大多数人民的社会主义联盟的自觉社会主义力量的作用。在这个组织中，我们大多数人民都是以民主的方法解决日常生活中的具体问题的。日常生活的基本目标是：自由的社会主义社会集中所有力量来发展人类的福利。
    我们遗憾的是，你们在现在的情况下还没有可能了解我们社会生活中党员如何发挥他的作用，也就是他的劳动热情、忠于人民和他的才干。当你们参观我们人民解放斗争博物馆的时候，你们可能部分地了解到人民对他们的信任是从那里来的。我们希望所有外国客人，也特别希望你们能详尽地了解我们的社会生活。我们相信，你们会对我们了解得更清楚。我们没有把自己的社会制度强加于别人的愿望，但是也不希望别人把自己的社会制度强加于我们。因为这种制度形式是属于我们自己的，因为它现在是、将来也仍然是我们主观力量和物质条件发展的结果。我们丝毫不反对别人批判地对待我们的道路，但是如果有人否认我们建设社会主义的意志和目的，那将使我们感到痛心。这只能归结于我们和别人的制度形式有所不同。
    我们遗憾的是，你们没有机会看到我们人民同采取对外和对内巩固社会主义政策的国家和政治领导的一致性。人民之所以支持这些政策是因为它符合于他们的利益，它为加强国际和平和合作而服务，它有利于国际社会主义和人类的尊严。
    我和我的同志们都相信，地理上遥远的距离在今后不再成为我们更加深入了解的障碍。我们过去争取解放和社会主义的共同愿望所产生的同情，今后将更加迅速地发展和加强。
    愿我们人民和伟大的中国人民在久经考验的有威信的敬爱的领袖的引导下，成功地取得社会主义的迅速进步。
    为亲爱的友谊和社会主义进步，
    为了毛泽东主席的健康干杯！
