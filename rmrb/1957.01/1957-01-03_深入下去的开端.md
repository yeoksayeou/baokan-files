The Beginning of Going Deep
By our reporters Gu Weijin and Zhang Wei

In September of last year, Wang Jian, deputy director of the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee's Finance and Trade Office, attended the Municipal People's Congress meeting as a people's representative. From the opinions reflected by the representatives, he found that the representatives from basic construction areas and cultural districts had major complaints about the supply of goods: there was very little pork in the market, fresh fish, beef, chicken, and duck were often unavailable, vegetables and fruits were not fresh, there were very few varieties of grain, and the department store goods and stationery were incomplete... This was undoubtedly a sharp criticism of the First and Second Commercial Bureaus. After hearing these criticisms, Wang Jian immediately thought, "The problem is very serious. We should go down and take a look!" However, after a while, he hesitated: "These areas have set up many supply points. The problem won't be that serious. It might be an exaggeration."

After the Municipal People's Congress meeting, Wang Jian reported to the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee on studying the "Eighth National Congress" documents. After listening to Minister Jiao of the Municipal Party Committee's Basic Construction Department and Vice Mayor Xiong Fei talk about their experiences of going deep and discovering problems, Wang Jian felt that since the people's representatives had raised so many opinions on the supply of goods, how could he know that the problem wasn't that serious without going deep? What was the actual situation? He had no idea. It seemed that it was necessary to go deep into the lower levels.

So, before the Mid-Autumn Festival, Wang Jian and Fan Xiaobao, deputy director of the Second Commercial Bureau, invited a few managers from relevant specialized companies to set off together. When they arrived in Qingshan, they saw long queues of people buying pork in front of the food supply points. Wang Jian wondered, "Since the supply of goods is very sufficient, why do people have to queue to buy pork?" After holding a forum with relevant staff, they learned the following: In order to make more money, the food supply points had taken more than ten salespeople away from selling meat to sell eggs, so the meat salespeople were too busy, and customers had to queue. Then, they found that the regulation that pig offal could be sold at the price of meat was met with disapproval by the northern workers; there was too much fresh fish, and it couldn't be sold; the supply of noodles was insufficient; the cotton wadding and leather shoes were too small and not suitable for the needs of tall northeastern workers... These situations stunned them.

They found the local Party and government leaders and the relevant company managers and studied and solved these problems one by one (such as letting the vegetable supply points sell eggs, transferring some of the fresh fish, etc.). Then, they went to inspect the Wuhan University supply point on Luojia Mountain.

When they arrived at Wuhan University on Luojia Mountain, everything was as Wang Jian had expected: this "dead corner" in the supply work did indeed have many problems. At the food supply point, because there were too few meat salespeople, more than a hundred people were queuing to buy meat. People were restlessly clamoring. Wang Jian walked to the front of the queue and talked to a person:

	"Comrade, is it easy to buy pork?"
	"I can't tell you! I've been queuing since two or three o'clock last night, and now it's four or five o'clock in the afternoon, and I still can't buy meat."
	"Even professors are queuing to buy meat," a staff member said.
	"The problem of buying meat here is too serious! Especially professors are queuing like this, how does this conform to the Party's policy towards intellectuals!" Wang Jian thought to himself, and hurriedly walked into the school. He planned to ask the school to temporarily draw some people to help the salespeople sell meat. He happened to run into comrades from the general affairs office and the trade union. When they heard that he was the person in charge of the commercial department, they immediately surrounded him and said excitedly:
	"Now it's not just the problem of buying meat, the supply of fresh fish is also insufficient, and there are problems with the supply of vegetables, chicken, duck, fruit, department store goods, cultural goods, etc.!"
Wang Jian felt that the problem was getting more and more serious.
	"These many problems are related to the problems of various specialized companies, and only a few managers of specialized companies have come today, so it's not easy to solve the problem, what should I do?" He thought anxiously. "If I just rely on meetings to explain the seriousness of the supply situation to the managers, they won't pay attention to it. Isn't the Qingshan incident an example? It's better to let them come down and take a look in person!" With an idea, Wang Jian immediately said to everyone earnestly and humbly:
	"Our supply work has not been done well, I am very sorry. Now we are going to remedy it! We are going to call the managers of all relevant specialized companies to listen to your opinions on the supply work, and then everyone will jointly study solutions." As for the current shortage of meat salespeople, I hope that the school will immediately send people to help solve the problem of people queuing up.

Walking out of the school, Wang Jian and the few people who came with him studied the situation just now. Everyone felt that since there were so many problems with the supply work at Wuhan University, then the supply work at the nearby schools must also have problems. Representatives from the ten or so universities and colleges in Luojia Mountain and Yujia Mountain should be sent to hold a forum on improving the supply work centered on Wuhan University. The director of the Commercial Bureau and all relevant specialized company managers should attend the meeting to comprehensively solve the supply problems in the cultural district.

On September 27, Wang Jian, in the name of the Finance and Trade Office of the Municipal People's Committee, held a forum on improving the supply work in the Luojia Mountain and Yujia Mountain cultural district in the office building of Wuhan University. Representatives from more than ten universities and colleges in Luojia Mountain and Yujia Mountain expressed their opinions on the supply work one after another. A noisy sound rang out in the room:
	"Luojia Mountain is next to East Lake, but we can't eat fresh fish. Maybe fish like water and don't want to come to the mountain?"
	"The vegetable supply and marketing cooperative leaves the new vegetables unsold and sells the old vegetables first. As a result, after the old vegetables are sold, the new vegetables become old again. This method of 'promoting the new and storing the old' makes everyone eat old vegetables often."
	"The fruit varieties at the retail supply points are not only few, but they also mix the rotten ones together to sell, and you are not allowed to pick them out. Why can't the good ones and the rotten ones be sold separately?"

People's opinions were increasing, and then people mentioned that the prices of many commodities were higher than in the city; some supply points had capitalist management ideas; some supply points stipulated unreasonable business hours: when the school is in class, they are open, when the school is out of class, they are closed, and it is very inconvenient to buy things... The meeting lasted from 2:00 pm to 6:30 pm, and people had not finished expressing their opinions. Seeing that it was getting late, those who had not spoken handed their opinions on slips of paper to Wang Jian. At this time, a clear and powerful voice from the Wuhan University representative came from a corner of the venue:
	"In 1955, a director also brought people here to hold a meeting to solicit opinions on the supply work, saying that this time we would solve the problem, but after the meeting was over, nothing happened. We hope that this kind of phenomenon will not happen this time!"

Wang Jian stood up from the crowd. He apologized to everyone on behalf of the commercial department, he criticized the serious bureaucracy in the commercial department, and he declared that the commercial department would be responsible for forming a working group to live here and jointly study solutions to the supply problems with everyone.

After the meeting, Wang Jian and the deputy director of the Second Commercial Bureau and the managers of the specialized companies who participated in the meeting returned to Hankou. It was already dark. They took the opportunity to study how to improve the supply work while eating dinner. According to the opinions raised by the masses on their own supply points, and according to needs and possibilities, the managers of each specialized company actively put forward ways to improve the work: appropriately increase and adjust supply points, appropriately increase salespeople, increase the variety of goods, improve the quality of goods, adjust commodity prices, reduce commodity circulation links, improve service attitude; and hand over each supply point to the leadership of relevant schools (the commercial department is only responsible for business guidance), so that they can continuously improve their operation and management under the direct help and supervision of the school and the masses, and so on.

After implementing these methods, Wang Jian and the director of the Commercial Bureau, the managers of the specialized companies, etc. went deep again and again to check the situation of improving the supply work, listen to the opinions of the schools, discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner.

From National Day onwards, the supply work in the Luojia Mountain and Yujia Mountain cultural district, which has more than 50,000 professors, students, and staff, began to improve. People can buy the main non-staple foods and department store goods and cultural goods.

Using this working method of going deep into the grassroots and deep into the masses, Wang Jian achieved success in other work positions - focusing on going deep into the suburban grassroots vegetable production cooperatives and vegetable supply and marketing cooperatives, creating the experience of opening up a free vegetable market; focusing on going deep into the joint state-private Hua'an Department Store, creating the experience of improving the operation and management of joint state-private stores.

At the enlarged meeting of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee to deploy the study of the "Eighth National Congress" documents and study and handle the opinions of the people's representatives, Wang Jian's working method of going deep was praised. He lowered his head - he couldn't get used to others praising himself - and said calmly and slowly:
	"This is nothing, it's just the beginning."

    深入下去的开端
    本报记者　古维进　张碨
    去年9月间，武汉市人民委员会财粮贸办公室副主任王健，以人民代表的资格参加了市人民代表大会会议。从代表们反映的意见里，他发现基本建设地区和文化区的代表对物资供应工作的意见很大：市场的猪肉很少，鲜鱼、牛肉、鸡、鸭常常买不到，蔬菜、水果不新鲜，粮食品种很少，百货用品和文具用品不齐全，……。这对于第一、二商业局无疑的是一个尖锐的批评，王健听了这些批评马上想到。“问题很严重，应该到下面去走一走！”但是，过了一会，他犹豫了：“这些地区都设立了许多供应点，问题不会那样严重的，可能有些言过其实。”
    市人民代表大会会议结束后，王健到中共武汉市委汇报学习“八大”文件的情形。听了市委基本建设部焦部长和副市长熊飞谈深入下去、发现问题的体会以后，王健感到既然人民代表对物资供应工作提出了那么多的意见，自己没有深入下去怎么知道问题不会那样严重呢？实际情况究竟如何？自己根本不清楚。看来，还是非深入下层走一走不可。
    于是，中秋节前王健和第二商业局副局长范晓宝邀了少数有关专业公司的经理一同出发。到了青山，只见食品供应点的门口买猪肉的人排成长长的队伍。王健心中诧异地想：既然物资供应很充足，为什么买猪肉的还要排队？召开了有关工作人员座谈会，才知道是这么回事：原来食品供应点为了多赚钱，从卖肉的营业员里抽走十多个人去经营鸡子，因此卖肉的营业员忙不过来，顾客只好排队购买。接着，他们发现猪内脏规定顶肉的价钱，北方工人很有意见；鲜鱼太多，卖不出去；挂面供应不足；棉絮和皮鞋太小，不适合个子高大的东北工人需要……。这些情况，把他们楞住了。
    他们找到当地党政领导人员和当地的有关公司经理，把这些问题一一加以研究解决（如鸡子让给蔬菜供应点经营，鲜鱼调走一部分等）。然后，又到珞珈山武汉大学供应点检查。
    到了珞珈山武汉大学，一切不出王健的意料：这个供应工作中的
  “死角”，问题确是不少。在食品供应点里，由于卖肉的营业员太少，有一百多人在排队购买。人们不安地嚷成一片。王健走到队伍跟前和一个人谈起来了：
      “同志，猪肉好买吗？”
      “不能说！从昨夜两三点钟就排队，现在已经下午四五点了，还买不到肉。”
      “连教授也排队买肉了。”一个工作人员说。
      “这里买肉的问题太严重了！特别是教授也这样排队，这哪里符合党对知识分子的政策！”王健心里想着，急急忙忙走进学校。他打算要求学校临时抽出一些人帮助营业员卖肉。正好碰到总务处和工会的同志。他们听说他是商业部门的负责人，立即把他围起来，激动地说：
      “现在不仅是买肉的问题，鲜鱼也不够供应，还有蔬菜、鸡、鸭、水果、百货、文化用品等的供应都有问题！”
    王健觉得问题越来越严重了。
  “这许多问题，是关系到各个专业公司的问题，而今天只来了少数的专业公司经理，不好解决问题，怎么办呢？”他焦急地想。“如果光依靠开会给经理们说明供应情况的严重，他们是不会重视的。青山的事情不就是一个例子吗？还是让他们亲自下来走一走，看一看吧！”有了主意，王健马上认真地又是谦逊地对大家说道：
      “我们的供应工作没有做好，很对不起。现在我们要来挽救！我们要把各个有关专业公司经理叫来，听取你们对供应工作的意见，然后大家共同研究解决的办法。”至于目前卖肉的营业员不足，希望学校立即派人帮助，解决群众的排队问题。
    走出学校，王健和同来的几个人研究刚才的情况。大家感到，武汉大学的供应工作既然存在这么多问题，那么，附近的学校的供应工作也一定有问题。应该让珞珈山和喻家山这十多个大、专学校派出代表，以武汉大学为中心，举行一次改进供应工作的座谈会，商业局长和全部有关专业公司经理都来参加会议，全面解决文化区的供应问题。
    9月27日，王健以市人民委员会财粮贸办公室的名义，在武汉大学的办公大楼，举行了关于改进珞珈山和喻家山文化区供应工作座谈会。珞珈山和喻家山的十多个大、专学校的代表纷纷对供应工作提出意见。屋子里响起了一片嘈杂的声音：
      “珞珈山在东湖旁边，却吃不到鲜鱼，大概鱼喜欢水，不愿到山上来？”
    “蔬菜供销社将新菜搁着不卖，先卖陈菜，结果陈菜卖完，新菜又搁陈了。这个‘推陈储新’的办法，搞得大家经常吃陈菜。”
      “零售供应点的水果种类不仅少，而且还混着烂的一齐卖，不许挑选。为什么不能把好的和烂的分开来卖？”
    人们的意见越来越多，接着人们提到许多商品价格高于市内；有的供应点有资本主义经营思想；有的供应点规定了不合理的营业时间：学校上课，他们营业，学校下课，他们休息，购买东西非常不便……。会议从下午二时进行到六时半，人们的意见还没有说完。看见时间不早，没有发言的人都把意见写在纸条上递到王健的跟前。这时，会场的一角传来了武汉大学代表的清晰而有力的声音：
    “1955年也有一位局长带人来这里开会，征求对供应工作的意见，说这一次要解决问题，可是，会议散了，什么事都没有了。我们希望这一次不要发生这类现象！”
    王健从人群中立起来。他代表商业部门向大家道歉，他批评商业部门存在严重的官僚主义，他声明商业部门要负责成立一个工作小组，专门住在这里和大家共同研究解决供应问题。
    会开完了，王健和去参加会议的第二商业局副局长及专业公司的经理们回到汉口，天已经黑了。吃晚饭的时候他们就乘机研究如何改进供应工作。各专业公司经理根据群众对自己供应点提的意见，根据需要和可能，积极提出改进工作的办法：适当增设和调整供应点，适当增加营业员，增加商品种类，提高商品质量，调整商品价格，减少商品流转环节，改进服务态度；以及各供应点交由有关学校领导（商业部门只负责业务指导），使他们在学校和群众的直接帮助与监督下，不断改进经营管理工作等等。
    实行这些办法以后，王健又和商业局长、专业公司经理等深入下去，一次又一次地检查改进供应工作的情况，听取各学校的意见，发现问题，及时解决。
    从国庆节起，拥有教授、学生、职工等五万多人的珞珈山和喻家山文化区的供应工作，开始有了改进，人们可以买到主要的副食品和百货用品、文化用品了。
    运用了这次深入基层、深入群众的工作方法，王健在别的工作岗位上又取得了成绩——重点深入郊区基层蔬菜生产合作社和蔬菜供销合作社，创造了开辟蔬菜自由市场的经验；重点深入公私合营华安百货商店，创造了改善公私合营商店的经营管理的经验。
    在布置学习“八大”文件和研究处理人民代表意见的中共武汉市委扩大会议上，王健深入下去的工作方法受到了表扬。他低垂着头——他听不惯别人称赞自己——冷静地、迟迟地说道：
      “这不算什么，只不过是开始罢了。”
