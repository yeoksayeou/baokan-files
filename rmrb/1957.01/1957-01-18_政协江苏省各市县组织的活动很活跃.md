    新华社南京9日电　中国人民政治协商会议江苏省各市、县组织的活动很活跃。目前全省已有五十一个市、县成立了政协组织，共有委员三千七百六十一人。政协各市、县委员会还组织了文教、妇女、工商、宗教、医药卫生和社会人士等一百七十八个工作组，在各地开展了各种工作和活动。
    去年一年内，各政协市、县委员会还组织了各界人士八万多人学习时事、政策和哲学理论等。
    政协扬州市委员会的科学技术工作组在推动组员和联系科学技术界人士为工农业生产服务等方面做出了显著成绩。这个组的副组长胡光烈曾和苏北农学院微生物教授方定一、扬州市蛋品厂的技术员等人帮助扬州市蛋品厂制成了蛋白?新产品。
    政协苏州市委员会平时通过邀请各界人士参加会议、参加学习、进行个别访问、开展文娱活动等方式，普遍联系了社会上的耆宿，推动和组织这些人参加了各种社会活动和国家建设工作。苏州、无锡、徐州、江阴、南通等市、县的多年不出门的老人也都积极参加了政协的俱乐部和诗、剧本、掌故、地方志等研究小组的活动。
    最近政协江苏省委员会在扬州召开了第一次江苏省各市、县政协工作会议，会议确定今后各市、县的政协工作主要是密切依靠中共各市、县党委的领导，更广泛深入地开展各种活动，在增产节约运动中积极发挥作用。
