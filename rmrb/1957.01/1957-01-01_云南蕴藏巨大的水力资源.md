    Kunming Hydropower Design Institute has conducted a general survey of rivers throughout the province. The results of the survey prove that Yunnan Province possesses enormous hydropower resources.
    According to the latest estimates by the Hydropower Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, the total hydropower reserves of over 1,500 major rivers in the country (excluding those with an average total output of less than 1,000 kilowatts) is approximately 540 million kilowatts, of which Yunnan's hydropower reserves are around 110 million kilowatts, accounting for 21% of the nation's hydropower resources, which is more than the total hydropower resources of the United States. Li Tianzhu, Director of Yunnan Hydropower Engineering Bureau, recently stated in an article that the Nu River, Lancang River, and Irrawaddy River in western Yunnan, and the Red River in southern Yunnan, are all international rivers with extremely rich hydropower reserves. The reserves of the Nu River alone, within the Yunnan section, reach 86% of the total reserves of the entire Yellow River system, making it one of the rivers in the world with the richest hydropower resources. The hydropower resources of the Lancang River in the Yunnan section are equivalent to ten times that of Great Britain. The Jinsha River meandering in northern Yunnan, the Nanpan River in eastern Yunnan, and many plateau lakes such as Dianchi Lake, Erhai Lake, and Fuxian Lake, all possess enormous hydropower resources. If 50% of these resources could be utilized, and used for 50% of the time each year, the annual power generation could reach more than 250 billion kilowatt-hours, giving an average of 15,800 kilowatt-hours per person per year for the entire province.
    Yunnan Province has abundant rainfall, but because the rainfall is concentrated in a relatively short period of the year, coupled with steep terrain and rapid drainage, the difference between dry and flood season flows is very large. For example, last year's measured results in the middle reaches of the Yili River showed that the flood flow was more than 500 times the dry season flow. On such rivers, as long as reservoirs of considerable capacity can be built to store floodwaters, they can be used to supply water during the dry season.
    There is a broad future for building small hydropower stations in Yunnan to meet the needs of rural areas. It can be said that every place can find a site for building a hydropower station of dozens, hundreds, or thousands of kilowatts. Building such small hydropower stations can utilize local materials, using wooden pipes instead of steel pipes, and building suitable regulating ponds with wooden dams, minimizing the use of steel and cement. Labor can be organized during slack farming seasons, which can greatly reduce construction investment.

    云南蕴藏巨大的水力资源
    本报昆明讯　昆明水力发电设计院在全省范围内开展了河流的普查工作。普查的结果，证明云南省蕴藏着巨大的水力资源。
    根据电力工业部水力发电建设总局的最近估算，全国一千五百多条主要河流（全河平均出力小于一千瓩的不算）的水力蕴藏量约达五亿四千万瓩，其中云南的水力蕴藏量为一亿一千万瓩左右，占全国水力资源的21％，比美国全国水力资源还多一些。云南水力发电工程局长李天柱，最近在一篇文章里说：云南西部的怒江、澜沧江、伊洛瓦底江，南部的红河，都是水力蕴藏量极为丰富的国际河流。单是怒江在云南境内河段的蕴藏量，即达黄河整个水系蕴藏量的86％，是世界上水力资源最丰富的河流之一。澜沧江在云南河段的水力资源，相当于英国的十倍。蜿蜒在云南北部的金沙江，东部的南盘江，以及许多高原湖泊，如滇池、洱海、抚仙湖等，都蕴藏着巨大的水力资源。这些资源假设有50％可以利用，每年利用的时间以50％计算，全年发电量即可达到二千五百多亿度，全省人口每人每年平均可得一万五千八百度。
    云南省雨量丰沛，但是由于一年内降雨时间比较集中，再加上地势陡峻，泄水速度很快，因此枯水与洪水的流量悬殊很大。如以礼河去年在中游实测结果，洪水流量为枯水流量的五百多倍。在这样河流上，只要能建筑相当容量的水库，把洪水拦蓄起来，就可供给枯水期之用。
    为满足农村需要建设小型水力发电站，在云南有广阔的前途。可以说，每个地方都能找到建设数十、数百或上千瓩的水电站地址。建设这种小型水电站，可以就地取材，用木管代替钢管，用木坝造成适宜的调节水池，尽量少用钢材和水泥，可以利用农闲来组织劳动力，这样就可以使建设投资大大减少。
