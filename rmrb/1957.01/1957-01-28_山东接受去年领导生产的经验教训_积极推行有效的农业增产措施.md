Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 26th - Shandong Province will continue to actively promote various effective agricultural production increase measures on the basis of correctly accepting the experience and lessons learned from leading agricultural production last year.

    This issue was emphatically discussed at the conference of agricultural section (bureau) chiefs of various special districts (cities) convened by the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture from January 16th to 23rd. The conference analyzed in detail the successful experiences and failures in leading agricultural production and promoting various production increase measures last year, and believed that the various agricultural production increase measures promoted last year on the basis of realizing agricultural cooperation throughout the province played a positive role in promoting agricultural production increase. It guaranteed a comprehensive bumper harvest of various crops, and made the total output of major crops such as grain, cotton, and oilseeds in the province reach and exceed the original planned targets for 1957 ahead of schedule. The final effect of agricultural production proves that the technological reform with the four major production increase measures of building water conservancy projects, raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer, increasing the planting of high-yield crops, and promoting advanced production increase technologies, which was promoted throughout the province last year, was correct. However, some shortcomings and errors also occurred in the process of promoting various production increase measures, but one must not refrain from eating for fear of choking.
    The conference believed that those effective production increase measures should continue to be actively promoted in light of local conditions, and those technical measures that have proven unable to achieve the purpose of production increase, or that are not suitable for immediate and comprehensive promotion, should be stopped or given priority for key experiments. The conference also put forward eight production increase measures that should continue to be actively promoted this year in light of the province's specific conditions, including building water conservancy projects, increasing fertilizer application, promoting improved varieties, improving soil, promoting new farm tools, appropriately developing high-yield crops and increasing the multiple cropping index, preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, and improving cultivation techniques, and put forward specific requirements for each production increase measure.

    山东接受去年领导生产的经验教训
    积极推行有效的农业增产措施
    新华社济南26日电　山东省将在正确接受去年领导农业生产中的经验教训的基础上，继续积极推行各项行之有效的农业增产措施。
    在1月16日到23日山东省农业厅召开的各专署（市）农业科 （局）长会议上，曾经着重就这个问题进行了讨论。会议详尽地分析了去年领导农业生产、推行各项增产措施中的成功经验和失败教训，并且认为：去年在全省实现农业合作化的基础上所推行的各项农业增产措施，对推动农业增产起了积极作用，它保证了各种农作物的全面丰收，并且使得全省的粮、棉、油料等主要作物的总产量，都提前达到并超过了原定的1957年计划指标。农业生产的最后效果证明，去年在全省范围内推行的以兴修水利、养猪积肥、增种高产作物、推广先进增产技术等四大增产措施为主要内容的技术改革，是正确的。但在推行各项增产措施中，也发生了一些缺点和错误，但是绝不能因噎废食。
    会议认为，应该因地制宜地继续积极推广那些行之有效的增产措施，对那些事实证明达不到增产目的的，或是不宜于立即全面推广的技术措施，则应该停止推行或是先进行重点试验。会议还根据本省的具体情况，提出了应该在今年继续积极推行的兴修水利、增施肥料、推广良种、改良土壤、推广新式农具、适当发展高产作物和提高复种指数、防治病虫害和改进耕作技术等八项增产措施，并且对每一项增产措施都提出了具体要求。
