Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 28th: Coal mine workers under the Harbin Administration of the Ministry of Coal Industry are actively responding to the call to increase coal production during the Spring Festival holiday.

On the morning of the 27th, the director's office of the Harbin Administration was constantly receiving long-distance calls from various coal mines under its jurisdiction, reporting their plans to increase coal production during the Spring Festival. A call from Shuangyashan Coal Mine stated that the Shuangyashan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party had held an emergency meeting of leading cadres from various mines. After research and decision-making, it was determined that, except for Lingxi Shaft, which has a large underground yard overhaul project, the overhaul tasks of other mines can be completed within one day. In order to shorten the overhaul time and ensure the quality of the overhaul, Hegang Coal Mine decided to ask the electromechanical workers of the Hegang Well Construction Bureau to help with the overhaul. According to preliminary understanding, 70% of the overhaul tasks of the coal mines under the Harbin Administration can be completed within one day. This creates favorable conditions for increasing coal production during the Spring Festival holiday. According to preliminary plans, each mine will be able to increase coal production by tens of thousands of tons during the Spring Festival.

The Harbin Administration has also formed seven groups headed by the bureau's leading cadres and engineers, planning to go to the seven coal mines under its jurisdiction on the 28th to express their regards to the miners who will increase coal production during the Spring Festival holiday.

This newspaper reports: The vast number of workers in various mining areas in Shanxi Province have taken active actions to warmly respond to the State Council's call to work as usual during the two-day shortened Spring Festival holiday. After receiving the relevant instructions on the 26th, the Party committees of the four state-owned coal mines in Datong, Yangquan, Fenxi, and Xishan convened Party committee meetings and meetings of leading cadres respectively. They made unified arrangements according to the State Council's notice, and the leading cadres then went down to the mines. The Yangquan Mining Bureau also organized a large number of cadres to go to residential areas to promote the great significance of contributing holiday overproduction of coal to the families of workers.

Workers in various mining bureaus have expressed their willingness to guarantee attendance during the two holidays. More than 790 workers in the Fenxi Mining Bureau had originally decided to go home for the festival. After hearing the State Council's call, they gladly gave up their plans to go home and celebrate the Spring Festival. Shi Jiujin, an underground transporter at the Fujiatan Mine, said at a mobilization meeting: "We must first consider the difficulties of the country and meet the country's needs for coal. Now we have decided not to go home and guarantee 100% attendance during the Spring Festival." They also decided to use their rest time to draw people to support the coal miners and produce more coal for the country. (Gu Ye)

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 28th: Workers in various coal mines in the Sichuan region under the Chongqing Administration of the Ministry of Coal Industry are warmly responding to the State Council's call, guaranteeing to continue mining coal during the Spring Festival. Nantong Coal Mine, the largest in Southwest China, and Tianfu Coal Mine, as well as Yongchuan Coal Mine, Jiayang Coal Mine, and other units, have all made preparations to continue production during the Spring Festival.

On the 27th, the trade union and the special mass reception room of Nantong Coal Mine received more than 70 representatives of coal mining, tunneling, transportation, and ventilation workers. They submitted guarantee letters to the mine leaders on behalf of the thousands of workers in these units. The guarantee letter stated: "We will continue to produce and work as usual during the Spring Festival, achieve safe production, improve quality, and overfulfill the national plan." Liu Chengxiang, a windlass operator who had originally planned to go home on the 29th to reunite with his lover, has abandoned his original plan. He said: "Producing as usual during the Spring Festival can produce 60 tons of coal every day, which can supply 10,000 people with coal for the Spring Festival. For the benefit of the country and the people, I have decided not to go home." The workers of this mine unanimously proposed a guarantee: to increase coal production by more than 6,000 tons for the country during the Spring Festival holiday.

Workers at the Tianfu Coal Mine have expressed their willingness to give up the Spring Festival holiday and continue production. Many workers who were planning to go home for family visits, celebrate the New Year, and get married have now changed their original plans. Each district and group in the first mine has universally launched a "No Absence During Spring Festival, Continue Production" challenge. All workers in the first mining district proposed that they will all be present during the Spring Festival, and the daily output will exceed the plan by 50 tons. The entire mine will increase the production of bituminous coal by 5,000 tons during the Spring Festival to supply the market in a timely manner.

While arranging for continued production during the Spring Festival, the mines have also arranged the content of workers' recreational activities. During the Spring Festival, Nantong Coal Mine will organize film screenings, carry out sports activities, and perform dragon dances so that workers can spend the Spring Festival both tensely and happily.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Workers of various mines under the Jingxi Mining Bureau are responding to the State Council's call, deciding to take out two days of holiday during the Spring Festival to produce as usual, and guaranteeing that the coal output in these two days will exceed the national task by one-third.

After seeing the State Council's call in the newspaper, the miners believed that increasing production during the holiday was a glorious task given to them by the country. They all happily changed their rest plans and spontaneously gathered to study measures to ensure safe production. Many workers who had bought train and bus tickets returned their tickets. Some workers who were preparing to go home for their weddings during the Spring Festival have written letters home to postpone their weddings.

The Jingxi Mining Bureau and its five production mines convened cadre meetings yesterday and today to formulate specific work plans related to holiday production. The equipment overhaul work originally planned to be completed in three days is now planned to be completed in 32 hours after research. The relocation of the power distribution station in the Datai Coal Mine originally required three days, but now it only takes one day, and the remaining two days can still support the miners in increasing production.

The director and deputy director of the Jingxi Mining Bureau and the heads of the Party committee, trade union, and youth league of the mine went to various mines today to provide specific assistance. They decided to spend the Spring Festival with the miners in intensive production.

In terms of living, the workers' consumer cooperatives in various mines have prepared ample meat, vegetables, and other New Year goods to supply the miners. In order to cooperate with the miners in increasing production, the stores that originally sold tea, snacks, fruits, and cigarettes have decided to operate as usual during the Spring Festival production period. The trade union has also organized three film teams to screen films in various mines. When organizing Spring Festival plays, the Fangshan Mine specially bought tickets and reserved seats for production workers, so that basically every shift of production workers can see the performance.

    黑龙江、山西、四川、北京煤矿职工响应国家号召
    决心在春节期间献出大量煤炭
    新华社哈尔滨28日电　煤炭工业部哈尔滨管理局所属煤矿职工，纷纷响应春节假期增产煤炭的号召。
    27日上午，哈尔滨管理局局长办公室里，不断有所属各地煤矿打来的长途电话，报告他们在春节期间增产煤炭的打算。双鸭山煤矿打来的电话说，中共双鸭山市委已经召开各矿领导干部的紧急会议，经过研究决定，除了岭西竖井因为井下车场检修工程任务大，其他各矿的检修任务都可以在一天内做完。鹤岗煤矿为了缩短检修时间和保证检修质量，决定请鹤岗建井局的机电工人帮助检修。据初步了解，哈尔滨管理局所属各煤矿春节的检修任务，有70％可以在一天内做完。这就为春节假期增产煤炭创造了良好条件。按照初步计划，各矿在春节期间将可增产煤炭数万吨。
    哈尔滨管理局还由局的领导干部和工程师们为首，组成了七个小组，计划在28日分头深入所属的七个煤矿，慰问在春节假期增产煤炭的矿工。
    本报讯　山西省各矿区广大职工已积极行动起来，热烈响应国务院发出的春节少休假两天照常生产的号召。大同、阳泉、汾西、西山等四个国营煤矿的党委在26日接到有关指示以后，分别召集了党委会和领导干部会议，根据国务院的通知作了统一安排，领导干部们接着纷纷下矿。阳泉矿务局还组织了大批干部到住宅区向职工家属宣传贡献假日超产煤炭的重大意义。
  各个矿务局的职工纷纷表示在两个假日保证出勤。汾西矿务局有七百九十多名职工原已决定回家过节。听到国务院的号召以后，他们都欣然放弃了自己回家欢度春节的计划。富家滩矿井下搬运工人石九金等在动员会上说：“我们要首先顾国家的困难，满足国家对煤炭的需要。现在我们决定不回家了，保证春节百分之百出勤。他们还决定利用轮休时间抽出人来支援采煤工人，多为国家生产煤炭。　（顾页）
    新华社重庆28日电　煤炭工业部重庆管理局所属四川地区各煤矿职工，热烈响应国务院的号召，保证在春节期间继续采煤。西南地区最大的南桐煤矿和天府煤矿以及永川煤矿、嘉阳煤矿等单位，都已经作好春节继续生产的准备工作。
    南桐煤矿工会和行政上专设的群众接待室里，27日接待了采煤、掘进、运输，通风等工种的代表七十多人。他们代表这些单位的几千名职工向矿的领导提出了保证书。保证书上写着：“我们在春节期间照常生产和工作，做到安全生产、提高质量，超额完成国家计划。”原来计划在29日回家同爱人团聚的风镐手刘成祥，已经放弃原来的打算，他说：“春节照常生产，每天就能采六十吨煤，可以供一万人的春节用煤。为了国家和人民的利益，我决定不回家了。”这个矿的职工一致提出保证：要在春节假期中为国家增产六千多吨煤。
    天府煤矿的职工纷纷表示放弃春节假期，继续生产。许多准备春节回家探亲、过年和结婚的职工，现在也改变了原来计划。一井的各区、各小组和个人，普遍开展了“春节不缺勤、继续生产”的挑应战。采煤一区全体职工提出，春节期间全部出勤，日产量要超过计划五十吨。全矿将在春节期间增产烟煤五千吨，及时供应市场。
    各矿在布置春节继续生产的同时，还安排好了工人文娱活动的内容。南桐煤矿在春节期间将组织放映电影、开展体育活动和耍龙灯等，使职工们能既紧张又愉快地度过春节。
    新华社28日讯　京西矿务局所属各矿职工响应国务院号召，决定在春节期间抽出两天假日照常生产，并且保证这两天的煤产量超过国家给的任务三分之一。
    矿工们在报上看到了国务院的号召以后，以为在假期增产是国家给予自己的光荣任务，都愉快地改变了自己的休息计划，纷纷自动集会，研究保证安全生产的措施。许多买好火车票、汽车票的工人把票退了。有些准备春节回家结婚的工人，已经写信回家推迟婚期。
    京西矿务局和所属五个生产矿，分别在昨天和今天召开了干部会议，订出有关假日生产的具体工作计划。原来准备三天完成的设备检修工作，经过研究，现在计划在三十二小时内完成。大台煤矿配电所需要迁移地点，原计划要三天时间，现在只需一天，剩下两天仍然可以支援矿工增产。
    京西矿务局正副局长和矿的党委会、工会、青年团的负责人，今天分别到各矿具体帮助工作，他们决定同矿工们一起度过紧张生产的春节。
    在生活方面，各矿的工人消费合作社已经准备下了充足的肉食、蔬菜等年货，供应矿工。为了配合矿工们增产，合作社原来卖茶点、水果、香烟等商品的门市部，决定在春节生产期间照常营业。工会还组织好三个电影队到各矿放映电影。房山矿在组织春节演戏时，特别给生产工人买好票，留了座位，使每班生产工人基本上都能够看到演出。
