    Hainan Dance Flower
    Long Yinpei

    After watching the performances by the Hainan National Song and Dance Troupe at this music and dance festival, my emotions remained stirred for a long time. It not only satisfied me artistically, but I also felt that their dance programs brought something new to dance creation.
    The dance "March Third," which describes the love festival of the Li people, is like a beautiful lyric poem, passionately praising the happy life of the people. As the curtain opened, the stage design, with its strong local flavor of coconut groves and distant mountains and nearby waters, immediately attracted the audience to the picturesque scenery of Hainan Island. The girls looked around on the hillside, waiting for their lovers. When the young men arrived, they formed a circle, raising the branches in their hands, symbolizing that they were hidden in the forest (this is very imaginative). The young men came out turning their floral umbrellas, searching for the girls. At this moment, the young men, floral umbrellas, girls, and branches on the stage formed a very beautiful picture. The young men gave gifts to the girls in different ways. After finding their loved ones, they walked away happily in pairs. There are no complex special effects or wonderfully changing formations or images in this dance. Like its music, it is very soft and smooth, flowing like a stream without any pauses. The content and plot are a continuous line of development. The southern-style scenery, costumes, and props are harmoniously and completely integrated.
    Any art requires a high degree of unity between content and form. The reason why "March Third" has a strong artistic appeal is due to its unique features. It unifies dance, music, beauty, and poetic conception in a lyrical tone, which plays an indispensable role in expressing the theme of the program.
    The strong atmosphere of life in this dance, expressing the gentle emotions and character of the Li people, shows that the creators have a deep understanding and profound affection for the Li people and their lives.
    "Half a Skirt" also uses a lyrical technique to kindly satirize and criticize a girl who doesn't like to work. Among the young people of the Li ethnic group, there is a popular saying: "Whoever weaves the most beautiful flower skirt is a good girl who loves to work." This dance shows that before meeting their lovers, the girls are all diligently weaving beautiful new skirts, except for one girl who is playful and doesn't like to work. When the girls all put on their new flower skirts to meet their lovers, this girl can only wear half a skirt, which causes everyone to laugh at her. When this lazy girl feels embarrassed and extremely sad, her friends do not abandon her but extend a warm hand to her.
    The educational significance of this program is expressed through vivid and concrete images. At the beginning of the dance, the character of the lazy girl is revealed through her impatiently sorting out the tangled threads and throwing down the unfinished skirt. When everyone is dancing happily together, she is nervous and flustered, constantly guarding against others discovering her half skirt. What a vivid and scathing satire! When others discover it and her lover leaves in anger, the expression of her regretful and ashamed feelings completes the task of the work's theme. The friends' concern for her at the end is also unique and novel. I believe this program has reached a high level in both ideology and artistry.
    I especially love these two dances because they offer some relatively successful experiences in how to use and develop folk dances in the creation of new programs, and how to avoid losing the original style. In this festival, some programs, although dancing to the movements of Chinese folk or classical dance, awkwardly adopted the structural methods of foreign dance forms, which made people feel uncoordinated and out of place. Some folk dance programs that have been sorted and adapted have not explored and highlighted the theme of the folk dance; the choreographers have not given the program a clear theme and their own ideas, but have only worked hard on the form of the dance—formations, movements, special effects, etc. Although it looks very lively and there are many tricks, it cannot leave a deep impression on the audience, or let the audience understand what the dance is about. These two dances do not have this phenomenon. They have not broken away from the national soil, have not abandoned the content to simply pursue the superficial formal effect, nor have they been limited to the original folk dance material; instead, they have boldly processed and created on the basis of the national culture, according to the local people's living customs. Isn't this precisely what we should learn from in our creation?

    海南舞蹈之花
    隆荫培
    在这次音乐舞蹈会演中，看了海南民族歌舞团演出的节目后，使我的感情久久不能平静下来。它不仅使我在艺术享受上得到了满足，我觉得他们的舞蹈节目给舞蹈创作上带来了一些新的东西。
      “三月三”这个描述黎族人民爱情节日的舞蹈，像一首美妙的抒情诗；热情饱满地歌颂了人民的幸福生活。幕一拉开，有着浓郁地方色彩的椰子林和远山近水的舞台美术设计，立刻就把观众吸引到美丽如画的海南岛情境中去了。姑娘们在山坡上四处张望，等待着爱人，当青年们走来时，她们围成一个圈，举起手中的树枝，象征着已经藏在树林中（这是很富有想像的）。青年们转动着花伞出来了，他们寻找着姑娘；这时，舞台上的青年、花伞和姑娘、树枝组成了很美丽的画面。青年们用不同的方式把礼物送给了姑娘，他们找到了自己心爱的人后，幸福地双双走开去了。这个舞蹈中没有复杂的特技，也没有变化奇妙的队形、画面；正像它的音乐一样，非常柔和、舒畅，像小河流水一样没有任何的停顿，内容情节是一条线的贯串和发展下来。具有南国风味的布景、服装、道具，谐和而完整地结合在一起了。
    任何艺术都要求内容和形式的高度统一。“三月三”所以能有较强的艺术感人力量，是有它的独到之处。它把舞蹈、音乐、美丽和诗意的构思统一在抒情的色调中，它们在表现节目的主题内容上起着不可分割的重要作用。
    这个舞蹈的浓厚生活气息，表现的黎族人民温厚的感情和性格，可以看出创作者对黎族人民和他们的生活是有较深的体会和深厚的感情的。
      “半边裙子”也是以抒情的手法，友善地讽刺和批评了一个不爱劳动的姑娘。在黎族的青年中，流行着这样一句话：“谁的花裙编织得最漂亮，谁就是爱劳动的好姑娘”。这个舞蹈就是表现姑娘们在会见自己的爱人之前，都在辛勤地编织着美丽的新裙子，只有一个姑娘贪玩不爱劳动。在姑娘们都穿起新的花裙去会见爱人时，这个姑娘只能穿起半边裙子，于是引起了大家的耻笑。当这位不爱劳动的姑娘受到这种难堪，陷于极度悲哀的时候，她的朋友们并没有把她丢开，而是向她伸出了热情的手。
    这个节目的教育意义，是通过生动具体的形象表现出来的。舞蹈的开始，通过不爱劳动的姑娘，没有耐心地理着弄乱了的丝线，和扔下没有做好的裙子，就把这个人物展现了出来。当大家在一起欢舞时，她怀着紧张和慌乱的心情，随时提防着别人发现她的半边裙子，这是多么生动和辛辣的讽刺！等到别人发现了，她的爱人也气愤而去时，她那种悔不当初的羞愧心情的表露，就完成了作品主题的任务。结尾所表现的朋友们对她的关怀，也是独特新颖的。我认为这个节目在思想性和艺术性上都达到了较高的水平。
    我特别喜爱这两个舞蹈，因为它们对创作新的节目中如何运用和发展民间舞蹈，以及如何不失去原有的风格上，带来了一些比较成功的经验。在这次会演中，有的节目虽然跳的是中国民间或古典舞蹈的动作，因为生硬地采用了外国舞蹈表现形式的结构方法，因此使人感到不协调、格格不入。有的整理和改编的民间舞蹈节目，没有发掘和突出民间舞蹈的主题；编导者也没有给节目赋予明显的主题和自己的意想，只是在舞蹈的形式——队形、动作、特技等方面下功夫，虽然看起来很热闹，花样也很多，却不能给观众留下深刻的印象，或者让观众了解到这个舞蹈是什么内容。这两个舞蹈都没有这种现象。它们没有脱离开民族的土壤，没有丢掉内容单纯追求外表的形式效果，也没有局限在原来民间舞蹈素材中；而是在民族的基础上，根据当地人民的生活习俗给予了大胆的加工和创作。难道这不正是值得我们在创作中学习的吗？
