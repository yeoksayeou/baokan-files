　　In the mountain gullies of Longtou, Yongshun, and Sanzhiyang in Yishan, Guangxi, live more than 20,000 Yao people. For years, they have climbed and toiled in these mountain gullies, never having ridden in a car or walked on a flat road. A long, long time ago, they wanted to build a road in these mountain gullies. Now, this wish has become a reality. The government built a branch line from the middle section of the Guizhou-Guangxi Highway, directly to the heart of this mountain gully—Longtou Market. It officially opened to traffic in July last year.

　　With the road open to traffic, the lives of the Yao people have changed. Previously, transportation was difficult here, and the rich manganese and coal deposits were not mined. Sixty percent of the abundant madder dye and oranges rotted on the ground. Valuable Chinese tallow trees, Eucommia ulmoides, and Sophora subprostrata herbs could only be burned as firewood. Tung oil congealed into a paste, becoming waste. With the road open, these local specialties are transported to other places in large quantities, with tung seeds alone reaching more than 200,000 jin.

　　The Yao farmers are all smiles, grateful to the Party and the government. The future life ignites infinite hope in their hearts. Before the road was open, they carried a load of tung oil and spent two or three days going to Desheng Street to exchange it for salt; one hundred jin of tung oil could only be exchanged for sixty jin of salt. Now that there is a road, they don't have to go to Desheng Street. Locally, one hundred jin of tung oil can be exchanged for two hundred jin of salt. Now, the Yao compatriots no longer worry about the difficulty of eating salt.

　　Longtou and Lalang markets are becoming more and more lively. Food companies, oil companies, supply and marketing cooperatives, and other organizations have been established. The Lalang market, with about forty households, holds a market every three days, and each time there are thousands of people attending.

　　With convenient transportation, the culture of the Yao people is also gradually improving. Six years ago, among the more than 20,000 Yao people here, you could not find ten people with a higher elementary school education. Now, among the ninety-seven students at the Jianji Central Elementary School in Longtou District alone, there are thirty-two Yao children. Three young people have also taken cars to Yishan to attend middle school.

    瑶山沟里通汽车
    于焕章
    在广西宜山的龙头、永顺、三只羊等山沟里，居住着两万多瑶族人民，他们长年累月地在这些山沟里爬山越岭、艰苦劳动；从来没有坐过车，也没有走过平坦的大路。在很早很早以前，他们就想在这山沟里修一条大路。现在，这个愿望已变成现实了。政府从桂黔公路的中段修筑了一条支线，由德胜直通到这个山沟的腹地——龙头圩，去年7月正式通车了。
    公路通车了，瑶族人民的生活面貌改变了。从前这里运输困难，丰富的锰、煤宝藏没有开采；盛产的芫莨颜料，橙柚等果类60％烂在地上；价值高贵的青小茥、杜仲、山豆根等药材只能当柴烧；桐油一缸一缸的凝成了膏状，变成了废品。通车了，这些土特产品，大批地调运到外地，仅桐子一项就达二十多万斤。
    瑶家的农民喜笑颜开，他们感激着党和政府。未来的生活在他们心里燃起了无限的希望。公路未通前，他们挑一担桐油，花两三天的时间去德胜街换盐，一百斤桐油仅仅能换六十斤盐。如今有了公路，不去德胜街，在本地一百斤桐油就能换二百斤盐。现在瑶家同胞不再愁吃盐难了。
    龙头和拉浪两个圩，一天比一天热闹起来，食品公司、油脂公司、供销社等都设立起来了。四十户左右的拉浪圩，三天一圩，每次赶圩的就有上千人。
    交通方便了，瑶家人民的文化也在渐渐地提高。六年前，这里二万多瑶族人民中，找不出十个高小文化程度的人；现在单就龙头区建基中心小学的九十七个学生中，就有三十二个瑶家子弟；还有三个青年坐上汽车到宜山上中学去了。
