Several months ago, the Fushun City Commercial Bureau of Liaoning Province formulated a massive plan to improve the service industry, deciding to move a group of high-level service industry shops and technicians from major cities across the country. This included Beijing's mutton hotpot, Tianjin's roast duck, Nanjing's pressed duck, Shanghai's Chinese and Western restaurants, barbershops, photography shops, and more...

To welcome the relocating personnel, a welcoming delegation of forty-five people, led by the Director of the Commercial Bureau, arrived in Lüda in advance, where they toured and sightseeing for more than half a month before welcoming the first batch of relocating personnel. This welcome trip cost more than 2,000 yuan.

The Kang Le Grand Restaurant, Shanghai's first-class restaurant, moved in, but there was no place to accommodate it. All the personnel lived in hotels for two months. During this period, the Fushun City Commercial Bureau revoked an existing state-owned cafeteria in the city, moved away several residents and a photography studio that had just been prepared, and spent more than 25,000 yuan decorating the building. Only then could the Kang Le Grand Restaurant open. Initially, people crowded in to taste the southern flavor. However, good times did not last long, and after a few days, the restaurant's business became bleak because southern dishes were not suitable for the taste of northerners, and the price of dishes was expensive. Later, although the southern chefs had to learn to cook northern dishes, the restaurant was still in a predicament of losing money due to the large scale and high expenses. In addition, Fushun City also moved in a high-end Western restaurant and a high-end photography studio from Shanghai. The Western restaurant waited for two and a half months before finding a place to open, while the opening of the photography studio is still "expected."

Taken together, the relocation and resettlement of these three units cost a huge sum of more than 80,000 yuan!

Improving the city's service industry was originally to show concern for the lives of the masses and to connect with the masses more closely. However, the result of "improvement" was not only squandering a lot of money but also creating greater inconvenience for the masses, thus becoming even more detached from the masses! It seems that if we want to truly improve the service industry, the ideological style of these young master-style people who "improve" the service industry must first be seriously "improved."

    “改善”服务业的结果
    几个月以前，辽宁省抚顺市商业局制定一个庞大的改善服务业的计划，决定从全国各大城市迁来一批高级服务业店铺和技术人员。其中包括北京的涮羊肉、天津的烤鸭、南京的板鸭、上海的中西餐、理发、照像等店铺……
    为了欢迎迁店人员，一个包括四十五人的欢迎代表团，在商业局长率领下先期来到旅大，在那里参观、游览，过了半个多月才把第一批迁店人员迎来。这一趟欢迎，花去了两千多元。
    上海第一流大饭店——康乐大酒楼迁来了，但是没有地方安置。全体人员在旅馆里一住就是两个月。在这期间，抚顺市商业局撤销了市上原有的一座国营食堂，迁走了几家居民和一家刚刚筹备就绪的照像馆，又花了两万五千多元修饰楼房，康乐大酒楼这才得以开业。起初，人们为了尝尝南味，也曾拥挤一时。但是好景不常，过了不多日子，饭店的生意就萧条了，原因是南菜不适合北方人的口味，菜价又贵。后来，虽然南菜厨师不得不学做起北方饭菜，但是，因为摊子太大，开支太多，饭店还是常处在赔钱的窘境。此外，抚顺市还把上海一家高级的西餐馆和一家高级的照像馆迁来了。西餐馆等了两个半月才找到地方开业，而照像馆的开业，还在“期待”中。
    合起来一算，迁移和安置这三个单位共花掉了八万多元的巨款！
    改善城市服务业，原是表示关心群众生活，也是为了更密切地联系群众，但是，“改善”的结果，却是除了挥霍了大量金钱以外，又给群众制造了更大的不便，因而也就更远地脱离了群众！看来，要想真正改善服务业，这种阔少爷式的“改善”服务业的人们的思想作风，首先得认真“改善”一下。
