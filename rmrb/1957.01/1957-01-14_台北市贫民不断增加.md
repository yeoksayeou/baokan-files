Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Taiwan newspapers report that the Taipei City Winter Relief Committee recently issued a relief fundraising appeal, stating that "impoverished citizens are more numerous than in previous years" in Taipei City. The fundraising appeal said: "In winter, there are many poor people in society waiting for compassionate people to provide sympathetic assistance... They have no winter clothing, nor enough food to eat their fill, and can only shiver in the biting cold wind, truly a scene of hunger and cold, the misery of which everyone can imagine." According to statistics, in Taipei City with a population of 700,000, the number of destitute people in need of relief has now exceeded 50,000, an increase of approximately 20,000 compared to the beginning of 1955, meaning the number of poor people has increased by 60% in two years. Chiang Kai-shek's Taipei City government officials said that the continued soaring of prices in Taiwan in 1956 was also one of the reasons for "adding many new poor households."

Among the tens of thousands of poor people in Taipei, tragic events often occur. On the 16th of last month, ten young poor people, including Wang Changmei, who lived in Caoshan, Taipei, were transporting wood to Zhuzihu. Because of the lack of warm clothing, five of them froze to death, and the other five were sent to the hospital after being frozen stiff.

    台北市贫民不断增加
    新华社讯　台湾报纸报道，台北市冬令救济委员会最近发表救济劝募书，说明现在台北市“贫困的市民比往年要多”。劝募书说：“在冬天里，社会上正有着不少贫苦的人，等待着善心的人们给予同情的救助……他们没有冬衣，也没有足够一饱的食粮，只能抖缩在凛冽的寒风中，真所谓饥寒交迫，惨厉之情，谁都可以想像得到。”据统计，在七十万人口的台北市，目前需要赈济的赤贫人口已经超过五万人，比1955年初增加了约二万人，即两年内贫民人数增加了60％。蒋介石集团台北市政府负责人说，1956年台湾物价继续飞涨，也是“增加了不少新的贫户”的原因之一。
    在数以万计的台北贫民中，经常发生一些惨不忍闻的事件。上月16日，住在台北草山的青年贫民王昌美等十人，往竹子湖搬运木材，都因缺乏寒衣，五人被冻死了，另外五人冻僵后被送往医院。
