Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 9th: Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin hosted a banquet for Premier Zhou Enlai at the Kremlin at 1:00 PM on the 8th.

    The Chinese side attending the banquet included delegation members He Long, Wang Jiaxiang, Liu Xiao, and staff members Qiao Guanhua, Xiong Fu, Zhang Yan, Gong Peng, and others.

    The Soviet side attending included Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Malenkov, Mikoyan, Molotov, Saburov, Suslov, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Shepilov, Furtseva, Shvernik, Aristov, Belyayev, Pospelov, as well as ministers and generals.

    Bulganin delivered a speech at the banquet. He first extended a heartfelt welcome to the guests from great China. He said that the experience of our relations and cooperation in national work and Party work shows that there has always been genuine mutual understanding and sincere friendship between us. This is entirely natural, because the leaders of our two countries are Communists, and their ideological foundation is Marxism-Leninism. He said that the people of the Soviet Union and China are not only united by friendly aspirations and the desire for cooperation based on the Five Principles, which our two countries have recognized, but also are eternally united by the great struggle to build a communist society.

    He continued, "Our Party, our people, all of us have been following the achievements of your country's socialist construction with infinite concern. We rejoice in your every victory. We watch with great joy how your Party, your people are realizing the great Marxist-Leninist ideas step by step, creatively applying the experience of other countries in building socialism. We are carefully studying your country's experience in building socialism, and your experience is a valuable contribution to the treasure trove of Marxist-Leninist doctrine on building socialism."

    Bulganin said that in international policy, the people of the whole world clearly know the great contribution of the Chinese people in consolidating peace and easing international tensions. We are very satisfied that we are walking the same path in the struggle for peace. We highly value the position you have taken on the Hungarian counter-revolutionary riots. Your comradely support and your efforts to expose the imperialists' conspiracies in Eastern Europe have given great help to us and the entire international workers' movement.

    Premier Zhou Enlai then delivered a reply. He expressed his gratitude for the warm welcome from the Soviet government and the Soviet people. Zhou Enlai said that Comrade Bulganin had just excessively praised the achievements of the Chinese Communist Party. If the Chinese Communist Party has some achievements in the cause of revolution and construction, then we must first thank Marxism-Leninism. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, it was the salvo of the October Revolution that brought Marxism to China. The Chinese Communist Party was able to lead the Chinese people to victory along the road of the October Revolution only after it was armed with Marxism-Leninism. The victory of the Chinese revolution and construction is inseparable from the support and help of the Soviet Union.

    Zhou Enlai said that the experience of the Chinese revolution proves that if we adhere to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and combine them with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, we will achieve victory; if we deviate from the principles of Marxism-Leninism or regard it as dogma rather than a guide to action, we will commit revisionist or dogmatic errors.

    Zhou Enlai said that in the history of the Chinese Communist Party, it has committed many mistakes, both big and small, and has experienced a long process of adhering to the truth and correcting mistakes. The Chinese Communist Party constantly educates its cadres ideologically to adhere to the principle of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, and to remain vigilant, striving to avoid repeating mistakes or making fewer mistakes.

    Zhou Enlai then said, "We have realized from our own experience that the unity within the Communist Party and the unity between the Communist parties of various countries are the most important guarantees for the victory of our common communist cause. Imperialism is looking for opportunities to sabotage us. In order to defeat the enemy, we must strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Our visit to the Soviet Union this time is to further strengthen the closest unity between our two countries. The great friendship between our two countries is eternal and unbreakable."

    布尔加宁主席宴请周总理
    新华社莫斯科9日电　苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁8日中午一时在克里姆林宫宴请周恩来总理。
    中国方面出席宴会的有代表团团员贺龙、王稼祥、刘晓以及随员乔冠华、熊复、张彦、龚澎等。
    苏联方面出席作陪的有伏罗希洛夫、卡冈诺维奇、马林科夫、米高扬、莫洛托夫、萨布罗夫、苏斯洛夫、赫鲁晓夫、勃烈日?夫、谢皮洛夫、福尔采娃、什维尔尼克、阿里斯托夫、别利亚耶夫、波斯伯洛夫以及部长们和将军们。
    布尔加宁在宴会上致词。他首先对来自伟大中国的客人们表示衷心的欢迎。他说，我们在国家工作和党的工作方面的关系和合作的经验表明，我们之间一直存在着真正的相互了解和诚挚的友谊。这是十分自然的，因为我们两国的领导者是共产党，它们的思想基础是马克思列宁主义。他说，苏中两国人民不仅是被友好的愿望和我们两国所承认的在五项原则的基础上进行合作的愿望所团结在一起的，而且是被建设共产主义社会的伟大的斗争永恒地团结在一起的。
    他接着说，我们的党，我们的人民，我们所有的人一直是以无限的关心注视着你们国家社会主义建设的成就。我们为你们的每一个胜利感到欢欣。我们以极其喜悦的心情注视着你们的党、你们的人民如何一步接一步地实现着伟大的马克思列宁主义思想，创造性地运用着其他国家建设社会主义的经验。我们正在仔细地研究你们国家建设社会主义的经验，你们的经验对马克思列宁主义关于建成社会主义学说的宝库，是一个宝贵的贡献。
    布尔加宁说，在国际政策方面，全世界的人民都清楚地知道中国人民在巩固和平和缓和国际紧张局势方面的巨大贡献。我们十分满意在为争取和平的斗争中我们走着同一条道路。我们非常珍视你们对匈牙利反革命暴乱所采取的立场。你们的同志式的支持和你们为揭露帝国主义者在东欧的阴谋活动所作的努力给予了我们和整个国际工人运动以巨大帮助。
    周恩来总理接着致答词。他对苏联政府和苏联人民的热烈欢迎表示感谢。周恩来说，刚才布尔加宁同志过分的称赞了中国共产党的成就。如果说中国共产党在革命和建设的事业中有一些成就的话，那么首先就要感谢马克思列宁主义。正如毛泽东同志所说过的那样，是十月革命一声炮响把马克思主义送到了中国。中国共产党是在用马克思列宁主义武装起来以后才能够领导中国人民沿着十月革命的道路走向胜利的。中国的革命和建设的胜利，同苏联的支持和帮助是分不开的。
    周恩来说，中国革命的经验证明，如果我们坚持马克思列宁主义的原则并且把它同中国革命的具体实践结合起来，我们就会取得胜利；如果我们离开了马克思列宁主义的原则或者把它看成是教条而不是行动的指南，我们就会犯修正主义的或者教条主义的错误。
    周恩来说，在中国共产党的历史上曾经多次犯过大大小小的错误，并且曾经经历了坚持真理、改正错误的长期过程。中国共产党经常在思想上教育自己的干部坚持马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的方针，并且保持警惕，力求避免重犯错误或者少犯错误。
    周恩来接着说，我们从切身的经验中认识到共产党内部的团结，各国共产主义政党之间的团结，是我们共同的共产主义事业取得胜利的最重要的保证。帝国主义正在寻找机会，对我们进行破坏。为了击败敌人，我们必须加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结。我们这次到苏联来访问就是要进一步加强我们两国最亲密的团结。我们两国的伟大友谊是永恒的、牢不可破的。
