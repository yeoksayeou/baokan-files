Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 11th: The government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, returned to Berlin from Moscow by special train on the morning of the 10th.

At the station, Grotewohl spoke to those who welcomed them about the Moscow talks. He said: The governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union hold completely identical views on the current international situation. The two governments also share a common determination to further strive to safeguard peace and the cause of progress.

Grotewohl said: In the negotiations between the German and Soviet governments, the issue of disarmament and the related issue of establishing a European arms limitation zone occupied an important place. The two governments unanimously believe that "if an agreement is reached on disarmament and if European countries are willing to participate in cooperation within a pan-European collective security system, peace in Europe will be guaranteed."

Grotewohl continued: During our talks, the relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union in various aspects were discussed in detail. This will undoubtedly make the friendship and cooperation between our two countries closer.

Grotewohl continued: When discussing the German issue, we reiterated that the main obstacle to solving the German issue on a peaceful and democratic basis is the re-militarization of West Germany.

Grotewohl also spoke about the meeting with the Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai. He pointed out that the fraternal alliance between the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the German Democratic Republic "encourages us to move forward with confidence and greater strength on the road to completing our current tasks."

According to a report in the "Neues Deutschland" on the 10th: The government delegation of the German Democratic Republic made a short stop in Warsaw on the evening of the 9th on its way back to the country and had cordial and friendly conversations with Polish Deputy Prime Minister Nowak and Foreign Minister Rapacki, etc. in the special train.

    新华社柏林11日电　以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团在10日上午乘专车从莫斯科回到柏林。
    格罗提渥在车站上向欢迎他们的人们谈到在莫斯科的会谈经过。他说：德意志民主共和国和苏联两国政府对于当前国际局势的看法是完全一致的。两国政府并且有着为保卫和平和进步事业而进一步努力的共同决心。
    格罗提渥说：在苏德两国政府的谈判中，关于裁军问题和与此相联系的建立欧洲军备限制区域的问题占据重要的地位。两国政府一致认为，“如果在裁军问题上达成协议，如果欧洲国家都愿意参与全欧集体安全体系的合作，欧洲的和平就将获得保障”。
    格罗提渥接着说：在我们的会谈中，详细地讨论了德意志民主共和国同苏联的各方面关系。这无疑将使我们两国之间的友谊和合作更加密切。
    格罗提渥继续说：在讨论德国问题时，我们重申：在和平、民主基础上解决德国问题的主要障碍是西德的重新军国主义化。
    格罗提渥还谈到同以周恩来总理为首的中国政府代表团的会谈。他指出，苏联和中华人民共和国同民主德国结成的兄弟联盟“鼓舞着我们满怀信心地以更大的力量在完成我们当前任务的道路上前进。”
