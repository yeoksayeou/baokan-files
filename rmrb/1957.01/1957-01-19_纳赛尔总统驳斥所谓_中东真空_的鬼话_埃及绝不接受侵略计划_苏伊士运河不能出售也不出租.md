Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 18th. According to a report in the "Republic Daily" on the 17th, Egyptian President Nasser said when he received American journalist Karl Wiegand: "We will absolutely not accept the Western plan, which assumes that there is a vacuum in the Near East and the Middle East that must be filled by Western countries." He said: "We ourselves will fill this vacuum. In fact, we have already filled this vacuum."

Nasser's remarks are considered to be directed at the US Middle East plan. He refuted the so-called "Middle East vacuum" argument. Nasser said: "First of all, there is no such vacuum, and even if we assume that such a vacuum exists, then it must be filled by Arab nationalism. Arab nationalism is not directed at anyone who does not interfere in our internal affairs and respects our independence."

Nasser said that the real and more important vacuum that exists at present is a psychological vacuum, which cannot be filled unless through mutual understanding, sincerity towards each other, and coordinated efforts to consolidate peace.

Nasser also said: "The Suez Canal can neither be sold nor leased." He said: "No responsible politician can sell or lease his country's sovereignty." Nasser made these remarks in response to a question raised about newspaper reports. These newspaper reports said that someone had made a suggestion to Egypt that it lease the Suez Canal for ten years in exchange for US dollars to be used for the high dam construction project. Nasser said that someone had made such a suggestion, but he did not take it seriously.

    纳赛尔总统驳斥所谓“中东真空”的鬼话
    埃及绝不接受侵略计划
    苏伊士运河不能出售也不出租
    新华社开罗18日电　据“共和国报”17日报道，埃及总统纳赛尔在接见美国记者卡尔·魏冈德的时候说：“我们绝对不会接受西方的计划，这个计划假定近东和中东存在着真空而这种真空必须由西方国家来填补。”他说：“要由我们自己来填补这种真空。实际上我们已经填补了这种真空。”
    纳赛尔的谈话被认为是针对美国的中东计划而说的。他驳斥了所谓“中东真空”的论调。纳赛尔说：“首先，并没有这种真空，而即使我们假定存在着这种真空，那么也必须由阿拉伯民族主义来填补。阿拉伯民族主义并不针对不干涉我们内政和尊重我们的独立的任何人。”
    纳赛尔说，目前所存在的真正的、比较重要的真空是心理真空，这种真空是不能填补的，除非是通过互相了解，彼此之间有诚意，并且配合起来共同努力巩固和平。
    纳赛尔还说：“苏伊士运河既不能出售，也不出租。”他说：“没有一个负责的政治家能够把他的国家的主权拿来出售或是出租的。”纳赛尔的这番话是在答复一个就报纸消息提出的问题时说的。这些报纸消息说，有人向埃及提出一项建议，要它把苏伊士运河出租十年，来换取美元用来进行建筑高水坝的工程。纳赛尔说，有人提出过这种建议，但是他没有认真看待这种建议。
