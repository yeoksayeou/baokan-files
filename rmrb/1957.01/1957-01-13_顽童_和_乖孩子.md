    The British Prime Minister, Eden, who launched a large-scale attack on Egypt a little over two months ago, was forced to leave Downing Street amidst internal and external attacks, with a mood darker than the London fog, to spend his sixtieth year in Wiltshire.
    Eden's resignation caused different reactions in every corner of the world. Among these reactions, the Associated Press pointed out that one thing "is certain to be noticed by the British public." This is that Washington was not surprised at all, and Eisenhower did not express "regret" as usual.
    In fact, the sensitive British public will not only notice this, but also see more in the attitude of that "friend" across the Atlantic. In recent times, Washington's attitude towards the British government has been extremely cold. Eden asked to see Eisenhower several times, but was always turned away. The British "Daily Mail" wrote with dissatisfaction: "For nine weeks, our ambassador to Washington has only received one purely formal reception." "The implication seems to be that as long as Eden is Prime Minister, Washington considers Britain to be a naughty boy who refuses to mend his ways."
    But when Macmillan climbed into the seat of British Prime Minister, Washington's face immediately turned into a smiling one. American newspapers and news agencies immediately began to sing in unison the tune of "Anglo-American friendship." Senior American officials even "enthusiastically" said that whenever Macmillan comes to Washington, he is welcome. Obviously, in Washington's eyes, Macmillan is by no means a "naughty boy" like Eden, but a veritable "good boy."
    Why does Washington regard Eden as a "naughty boy"? American propagandists are trying to make people believe that this is because Eden used force in Egypt, and the "anti-colonialist" United States cannot but condemn him. However, the "Eisenhower Doctrine" has already exposed this newly painted "mask." Even many American newspapers have admitted that the current US policy of using military threats in the Middle East is exactly the same as Britain's attack on Egypt. Now, these propagandists' praise for Macmillan has further exposed their own hypocrisy. Because everyone knows that Macmillan is also a die-hard colonialist. Agence France-Presse recently wrote: "Macmillan was the most loyal supporter of his (Eden's) Near East policy. Macmillan was said to be even more determined than Eden when the Suez crisis broke out."
    So, what exactly is Washington's standard for distinguishing between "naughty boys" and "good boys"? The answer is simple: the standard is whether they can listen to Washington's orders obediently. Although Eden also had to look at Washington's face when he was about to do something, he still dared to make some decisions on his own in some cases. For example, last spring, he received Bulganin and Khrushchev in London, which caused Washington's displeasure. But the situation of his successor is different. American news agencies are now excitedly writing biographies for Macmillan, saying that the new Prime Minister's mother is American, that part of his income comes from the United States, and are vigorously exaggerating his close relationship with Eisenhower, Dulles, and US Treasury Secretary Humphrey.
    In this way, Washington's obviously different attitude towards Eden, the "naughty boy," and Macmillan, the "good boy," is very clear. Washington is currently trying to take the place of British colonialists in the Middle East after they have stumbled; and the American authorities' use of angry coldness to treat "naughty boys" and smiling praise to treat "good boys" is nothing more than to make Britain more obedient to its own words.

### “顽童”和“乖孩子”

    “顽童”和“乖孩子”
    两个多月前曾经发动大举进攻埃及的英国首相——艾登，在内外夹攻之下，怀着比伦敦的浓雾更其沉暗的心情，被迫离开了唐宁街，到尉尔特郡去度其花甲之年去了。
    艾登的辞职，在世界每个角落引起了不同的反应。在这些反应中，合众社指出有一件事“是一定会被英国的公众注意到的”。这就是：华盛顿对此毫不感到惊奇，而艾森豪威尔也没有像通常那样表示“遗憾”。
    其实，敏感的英国公众不但会注意到这一点，而且还从大西洋彼岸那个“朋友”的态度中看到了更多的东西。在最近一段时期中，华盛顿对英国政府的态度一直是冷淡得无以复加。艾登几次求见艾森豪威尔，结果都尝到了闭门羹。英国“每日简报”不满意地写到：“九个星期以来，我们驻华盛顿的大使只受到一次纯粹是形式上的接见。”“推论好像是，只要艾登还当首相，华盛顿就认为英国是一个不肯改过自新的顽童。”
    但是当麦克米伦一爬上英国首相的座位，华盛顿的脸色马上就变得笑容可掬了。美国的报刊和通讯社马上一致高唱起“英美友谊”的调子。美国高级官员甚至“热情”地说，不论麦克米伦什么时候到华盛顿来，他都是受欢迎的。显然，在华盛顿的眼目中，麦克米伦决不是艾登那样的“顽童”，而是一个地道的“乖孩子”。
    华盛顿为什么把艾登当作“顽童”呢？美国的宣传家企图使人相信，这是因为艾登在埃及动用了武力，“反殖民主义”的美国就不能不责备他。但是，“艾森豪威尔主义”已经戳穿了这张刚刚画好不久的“画皮”。连美国的不少报刊也已经承认，目前美国在中东采取武力威胁政策和英国进攻埃及的做法是同出一辙的。现在，这些宣传家对麦克米伦的赞赏又使他们自己进一步露出了马脚。因为谁都知道，麦克米伦也是一个死硬的殖民主义者。法新社在最近还写道：“麦克米伦是最忠实支持他（艾登）的近东政策的。麦克米伦在苏伊士危机爆发时，据说比艾登还要坚决。”
    那末，华盛顿区分“顽童”和“乖孩子”的标准究竟是什么呢？答案很简单，标准是能否俯首贴耳地听从华盛顿的吩咐。艾登在动手干一件事的时候，虽然也要看看华盛顿的脸色，但是在有些时候他毕竟还敢于自作一些主张，例如，去年春天，他在伦敦接待了布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫，就曾引起华盛顿的不快。而他的继任者的情况就不同了。美国通讯社这两天正兴高彩烈为麦克米伦作传，其中说：这位新任首相的母亲是美国人，他有一部分收入是来自美国的，并竭力渲染他同艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯，以及美国财政部长汉弗来的亲密关系。
    这样，华盛顿对艾登这个“顽童”和对麦克米伦这个“乖孩子”采取了显然不同的态度，其用意就很明白了。华盛顿目前正想乘英国殖民主义者栽了跟斗之后取而代其在中东的地位；而美国当权人物用含怒的冷淡来对待“顽童”，用带笑的赞赏来对待“乖孩子”，都不过是为了使英国更加俯首贴耳地听自己的话而已。　（樵）
