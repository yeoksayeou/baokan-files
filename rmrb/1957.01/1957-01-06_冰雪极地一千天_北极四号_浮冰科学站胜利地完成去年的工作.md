Xinhua News Agency, January 5th: According to a TASS report on January 3rd: The "North Pole-4" floating ice station has been drifting in the central Arctic region for a thousand days.

    The scientific station was established in April 1954. Such a long period of drifting by a scientific station through the Arctic Ocean is unprecedented in the centuries-long history of exploring and conquering the Arctic.

    A total of three groups of polar personnel have been rotated at the scientific station. Under extremely harsh climatic conditions, they have continuously conducted meteorological, hydrological, and geophysical observations, studied the topography and geology of the Arctic Ocean floor, and investigated the physical and chemical properties of ice floes—elasticity, structure, and solidity. They successfully completed the entire scientific work plan for last year.

    Since the first group of personnel landed on the ice, the ice floe has drifted approximately six thousand five hundred kilometers along the meridian one hundred and eighty degrees, the boundary between the eastern and western hemispheres. They passed through the area of the Arctic that is known as the "difficult-to-reach polar region," passed over the ridge of the Lomonosov Underwater Mountain Range, and areas close to the geographic North Pole.

    Currently, the location of the "North Pole-4" scientific station is near the Greenwich Meridian, at approximately 88 degrees North latitude. This is a region of the Arctic Ocean that is rarely studied and has the most unfavorable drifting conditions. At present, continuous attacks by major storms are damaging the ice floe. Due to the movement of the ice floe, the ice block has shrunk to one-fortieth of its original area, and the accumulation of snow on the ice is gradually reducing the buoyancy of the ice.

    冰雪极地一千天
    “北极四号”浮冰科学站胜利地完成去年的工作
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社3日讯：“北极四号”浮冰科学站已经在北极中心区域飘浮了一千天。
    科学站是1954年4月建立的。科学站这样长期地飘浮并且通过北冰洋，还是多世纪以来考察和征服北极的历史上破天荒的事。
    科学站一共更换了三批极地工作人员。他们在极其恶劣的气候条件下，不断地进行着气象、水文和地球物理的观测，研究北冰洋底的地形和地质，考察冰块的物理化学特性——弹性、结构和坚度。他们胜利地完成了去年的全部科学工作计划。
    从科学站的第一批工作人员降落到冰上以后，浮冰大致沿东西半球的分界线——经线一百八十度飘浮了六千五百公里。他们经过了北极的被人称为“难于到达的极地”区域，经过了洛蒙诺索夫海底山脉的山脊和紧靠地理北极的地方。
    现在“北极四号”科学站的方位在格林威治子午线、北纬八十八度附近。这是北冰洋的一个很少有人去研究的而且也是飘浮条件最不利的地区。目前，大风暴的袭击不断破坏着冰块。由于冰块的移动，冰块缩小到原来面积的四十分之一，冰上积雪增加，使冰块的浮力在慢慢减小。
