Xinhua News Agency, Ankara, 22nd: The Ankara conference of the four Muslim member countries of the Baghdad Pact concluded on the evening of the 21st. In the communiqué issued after the meeting, "satisfaction" was expressed regarding the Eisenhower Plan, by which the United States attempts to control the Middle East.

    The communiqué expressed "full support" for the various measures stipulated in the plan. It also repeated the worn-out cliché of a so-called communist "threat" to the region, portraying the American aggression plan as the best one could find to maintain peace in the region and improve the economic conditions of the people in the region.

    The communiqué also described the Baghdad Pact military bloc as having "great significance and utility" for the Middle East region and world peace.

    Referring to the Suez Canal issue, the communiqué stated that the four countries hoped that the issue of maintaining freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal, in accordance with the principles of Egyptian sovereignty, could be re-established in the spirit of the 1888 Convention. At the same time, the communiqué repeated the Western countries' attempt to negate Egyptian sovereignty over the Suez Canal, saying that they "hope the canal will be free from the influence of any country's national policies."

    The communiqué even expressed "regret" over Syria's cutting off of oil pipelines through its territory to protest the British and French aggression against Egypt. The four countries demanded the rapid repair of the pipelines.

    The communiqué reviewed the United Nations General Assembly's resolution of January 19, demanding the immediate withdrawal of Israeli troops from Egypt. It also said that the four countries believe that the responsibility for maintaining peace in the region must continue to be borne entirely by the United Nations. They demanded that the United Nations take into account the legitimate rights of the Arab countries and resolve the Palestine issue as soon as possible.

    Xinhua News Agency, Ankara, 22nd: Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy said in Ankara on the 20th that the Baghdad Pact Muslim member states' conference discussed the Kashmir issue.

    Suhrawardy said: Turkey and Iraq's support in the United Nations for Pakistan's view on the Kashmir issue demonstrates the spirit of the Baghdad Pact.

    巴格达条约穆斯林国家会议发表公报
    给艾森豪威尔计划做传声筒
    据新华社22日讯　安卡拉消息：巴格达条约四个穆斯林国家安卡拉会议，21日晚上结束。在发表的会议公报中，对于美国企图控制中东的艾森豪威尔计划表示“感到满意”。
    公报表示“完全赞成”这个计划所规定的各种措施。并且重复了所谓共产主义对这个地区的“威胁”的滥调，而把美国的侵略计划说成是维护这个地区的和平和改善这个地区人民经济情况所能找到的最好的计划。
    公报还把巴格达条约这个军事集团说成对中东地区和世界和平有“重大的意义和功用”。
    公报在提到苏伊士运河问题时说，四国希望，在符合埃及主权的原则下维持苏伊士运河通航自由的问题，可以根据1888年公约的精神重新确定下来。同时，公报又重复了西方国家企图否定埃及对于苏伊士运河主权的论调，说什么“希望运河脱离任何国家的国家政策的影响”。
    公报对于叙利亚切断通过境内的油管以抗议英法侵略埃及一事，竟然表示“遗憾”。四国要求迅速修复油管。
    公报追述了联合国大会1月19日通过的要求以色列军队立即撤出埃及的决议。它还说，四国认为，维护这个地区的和平的责任必须继续完全由联合国担负。它们要求联合国考虑到阿拉伯国家的合法权利，及早解决巴勒斯坦问题。
    新华社22日讯　安卡拉消息：巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底20日在安卡拉说，巴格达条约穆斯林成员国会议讨论了克什米尔问题。
    苏拉瓦底说：土耳其和伊拉克在联合国支持巴基斯坦对克什米尔问题的观点，这表明了巴格达条约的精神。
