    Welcome Such Movie Advertisements

    In recent days, several eye-catching movie advertisements have been posted on the streets, possessing artistic power that attracts audiences.

    One is the street advertisement for the Polish comedy "Irena, Go Home!" The composition is so simple, the ink is so economical, yet the content is so meaningful. The artist uses cartoon-like exaggeration to vividly portray the distinct character of the film's protagonist, Irena's husband, Majewski, prominently depicting his hand as if issuing commands. From the picture, we not only see the lifelike appearance of this character, but we also seem to hear his commanding voice: "Irena, go home!"

    A poster advertisement for the Yugoslavian feature film "Old Foes and New Grievances" is also a thought-provoking work of art. It is entirely expressed in somber tones: a kind Yugoslav woman of the nineteenth century, abandoned by an American-style rogue, stands blankly, draped in a black cloak. ... She, a great mother, seems to be denouncing to everyone the dark old society that created the unfortunate encounters of her life. The picture presents a gloomy atmosphere, giving the audience an infinite feeling of sorrow, thereby arousing people's hatred for such a cursed old society, such a cursed old era.

    The movie advertisement for the domestic color feature film "The New Year's Sacrifice," painted by the artist Zhang Ding, is an artistic masterpiece with national style. The film's protagonist, Xianglin's Wife, wears an apron with Chinese folk patterns around her waist. She holds a live carp for sacrificial use on a red tray, facing a sacrificial table with incense burners and candlesticks. From this picture, we seem to come into contact with the vivid image of a simple and kind rural working woman of old China, created by Mr. Lu Xun.

    I believe that good movie advertising design should not only be eye-catching promotional material, but also artistic creations that reach a certain artistic level; it should also be presented as an independent work of art for the public to appreciate. This probably depends on the close cooperation of more artists and filmmakers.

专栏：伊伦娜回家去！

    欢迎这样的电影广告画
    前些日子，街头上粘贴了几幅醒目的电影广告，颇有吸引观众的艺术力量。
    一幅是波兰的喜剧故事片“伊伦娜，回家去！”的街头广告，构图是那样简单，着墨是那样经济，而内容又是那样意味深长。画家用漫画式的夸张手法，活灵活现地刻划出影片的主人公——伊伦娜的丈夫马耶夫斯基这一人物的鲜明性格，突出地描绘了他那只好像在发号施令的手。我们不仅从画面上看到了这个人物的栩栩如生的外貌，同时，我们也仿佛听到他带着命令口吻的声音：“伊伦娜，回家去！”
    “旧恨新仇”这部南斯拉夫故事片的一幅招贴广告也是耐人寻味的美术作品。它是整个用灰暗的色调来表现的：一个十九世纪的被美国式的流氓所遗弃的南斯拉夫的善良的妇女，披着黑色的斗篷，木呆呆地伫立着。……她，一个伟大的母亲，像是在对大家控诉那个给她的一生制造了不幸遭遇的黑暗旧社会。画面上呈现着一种阴冷的气氛，给予观众无限悲凉的感觉，从而引起人们憎恨那样一个可诅咒的旧社会，那样一个可诅咒的旧时代。
    画家张仃绘制的国产彩色故事片“祝福”的电影广告，是一幅具有民族风格的艺术佳作。影片的主人公祥林嫂腰间系着带有中国民间图案花纹的围裙，她用红色的托盘捧着一尾祭祀用的活鲤鱼，面对陈设着香炉烛台的供桌。从这幅图画中，我们似乎接触到鲁迅先生所创造的一个淳朴、善良的旧中国农村劳动妇女的生动形象。
    我认为，好的电影广告设计不仅应该是引人注目的宣传品，而且也应该是达到一定艺术水准的美术创作；它应该同时作为独立的艺术作品供群众欣赏。这恐怕有待于更多的美术家和电影工作者的密切配合。
