    "Relief" for the Rich
    In order to alleviate the burden of excessive accumulation of agricultural products, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recently implemented a food distribution program to low-income families in some states. However, because this distribution is primarily aimed at alleviating the accumulation in government warehouses, it has actually "relieved" many wealthy people. According to a report in the November 26th issue of "Time" magazine, "many 'low-income' families were traveling to distribution centers in taxis and brand-new cars."

    “救济”了富人
    为了减轻农产品积压过多的重担，美国农业部最近在一些州里实行了对收入低的家庭的粮食舍施。但是由于这种舍施主要是为了减轻政府仓库的积压，因而实际上是“救济”了许多富有的人。据去年11月26日“时代周刊”的报道，“许多‘收入低’的家庭是乘坐出租汽车和崭新的轿车前往配给中心站的。”
