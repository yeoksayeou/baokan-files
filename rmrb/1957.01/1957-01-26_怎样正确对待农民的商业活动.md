How to Correctly Treat Farmers' Commercial Activities
Zhao Zixian, Liu Zhihao

Since the opening of the free markets, agricultural cooperatives and farmers have universally engaged in commercial activities. They conduct commercial activities in many ways. Some agricultural cooperatives and farmers, in addition to self-production and self-sales, also purchase local agricultural and sideline products and local specialties to sell in distant places, and then resell daily-use industrial products in the local market; some engage in purchasing and sales activities outside for a long time; some entrust small merchants to purchase raw materials or semi-finished products to process into finished products and sell them in the market; some open various shops or set up stalls in towns to do business; some even set up brokerage firms to buy and sell on behalf of customers, seeking high commercial profits. Obviously, some of these commercial activities carried out by agricultural cooperatives and farmers are in line with the spirit of the policy, but some are not. The former commercial activities play a good role in enlivening urban and rural economies and meeting people's needs; the latter commercial activities not only directly affect the development of agricultural production and the consolidation of agricultural cooperative organizations, but also affect the completion of national procurement plans and the transformation and arrangement of merchants, and affect the stability of prices and market management to a certain extent.

At present, in order to allow the free market to develop in the right direction, the administrative and commercial leadership departments in many regions are conducting policy education on these agricultural cooperatives and farmers engaged in commerce according to the specific local conditions, drawing a line between farmers' trade, clarifying their thinking, and making them consciously give up commercial operations that do not conform to the spirit of the policy. At the same time, it is completely necessary to take appropriate economic measures for management. However, in many regions, the problem of farmers doing business ignores publicity and education work, and simply takes some strong administrative measures for management. For example, the Longtai Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Anyue, Sichuan, forced the members of the 13th Agricultural Cooperative of the township, Mei Chongguang, to purchase 47 pieces of bamboo ware originally worth 3.77 yuan for 2.89 yuan. A farmer in Luogang, Nanhai, Guangdong, was sentenced to one and a half years in prison for purchasing 3,000 jin of fertilizer through speculation (Editor's note: This judgment should be reconsidered); Heshan, Panyu and other counties once dispatched militiamen to arrest farmers who privately slaughtered pigs. Some areas have also ordered shops opened by agricultural cooperatives or farmers to close down within a limited time. Some, when checking the market, found that the goods were not for self-production, self-sale or self-use, and were not allowed to be bought or sold, or even confiscated. This rigid, even erroneous approach, will not only fail to achieve the desired results, but will inevitably arouse serious dissatisfaction among farmers. After Xingtai, Handan and other places in Hebei announced a ban on farmers doing business, some farmers' commercial activities have changed from overt to covert, and the phenomenon of smuggling hemp skin and native cloth to other places for sale is more serious than before. In Xingtai alone, more than 7,000 farmers were found to be trafficking in hemp. Liuyang and Liling in Hunan Province are adjacent to Jiangxi. Due to the large regional price difference of live pigs, farmers flocked to sell them to various border areas of Jiangxi. After the cadres intervened, the farmers formed gangs, holding sticks and escorting live pigs to Jiangxi at night, and the cadres did not dare to intervene any further.

It can be seen that it is very wrong and passive to adopt purely administrative measures for the leadership and management of farmers' trade. To deal with the issue of farmers doing business, we must strengthen policy publicity and education, and at the same time take some economic measures.

In this regard, some areas have already explored some methods. For example, Guangdong Province has proposed the principle of arranging farmers engaged in commerce according to different situations: (1) For small merchants who have transferred to agriculture, if the local market needs them, they have operating skills, and their income after joining the agricultural cooperative cannot maintain their own lives, they can be issued a temporary license to operate with approval, without affecting the arrangement of local merchants; (2) For ordinary farmers doing business, they should be persuaded and educated to let them focus on production; semi-agricultural and semi-commercial households who have joined agricultural cooperatives should generally no longer engage in commerce; (3) For "five-guarantee" households doing business, the agricultural cooperative should arrange them in sideline production. In the early stage of opening up the free market in Dongguan County, Guangdong Province, there were more than 230 farmers engaged in commerce. According to the above principles, 99 people were arranged, of which more than 50 were issued business licenses, and the others were arranged to engage in sideline or handicraft production. After such arrangements, farmers' business activities have basically stopped.

To properly solve the problem of farmers doing business, we should also help agricultural cooperatives to better plan agricultural and sideline production. We should help agricultural cooperatives to develop diversified operations according to local conditions and technical capabilities, and properly arrange labor, so that people can make the best of their talents, land can be used to its full potential, and things can be used to their best. After re-planning production in eight agricultural cooperatives in Zhitang Township, Longyou, Zhejiang, the area of lotus seed cultivation was expanded, and various agricultural and sideline production avenues such as raising mountain goats, fish fry, planting peanuts, and mulberry leaves were restored and newly opened; After the Zengchan Agricultural Cooperative in Lingshan Township reorganized its labor force, it restored five charcoal kilns and developed sideline production, increasing the income of its members. In this way, the farmers are at ease with production. At the same time, within the agricultural cooperative, it is also necessary to appropriately shorten the distribution time of the agricultural cooperative and improve the pre-distribution system according to possible conditions, so that the members feel convenient and no longer have the idea of engaging in commercial activities due to the lack of pocket money, so that they can concentrate on agricultural production.

In order to correctly carry out farmers' trade, many farmer service departments, exchanges, and agency firms have been restored and established in various places to serve farmers' trade. Doing so not only promotes the exchange of materials, enlivens the market, and meets farmers' purchasing and sales needs, saves farmers' production time, but also guides the normal development of farmers' trade to a certain extent and assists the state in managing the market. This is also an important way to strengthen the leadership of farmers' trade.

    怎样正确对待农民的商业活动
    赵自先　刘志浩
    自由市场开放以来，各地普遍出现了农业社和农民从事商业活动的现象。他们进行商业活动的方式很多。有的农业社和农民除自产自销以外，还收购当地农副土特产品远运外地出售，再贩回日用工业品在本地市场出售；有的长期在外面进行收购和销售活动；有的委托小商贩收购原料或半成品加工成品后在市场出售；有的在城镇开设各种店铺或摆摊做生意；甚至有的设经纪行，代客买卖，牟取高额商业利润。很显然，这些农业社和农民进行的商业活动，有的是符合政策精神的，但也有的是不符合政策精神的。前一种商业活动对活跃城乡经济满足人民需要起着良好的作用；后一种商业活动不仅直接影响农业生产的发展和农业社组织的巩固，并且在一定程度上也影响了国家采购计划的完成和对商贩的改造和安排，影响物价的稳定和市场的管理。
    当前，许多地区的行政和商业领导部门，为了让自由市场循着正确的方向发展，都根据当地的具体情况对这些经营商业的农业社和农民进行政策教育，划清农民贸易的界限，打通思想，使他们自觉地放弃不符合政策精神的商业经营，与此同时，采取适当的经济措施进行管理，这是完全必要的。但是，也有不少地区在对待农民经商问题上忽视了宣传教育工作，而单纯采取一些强硬的行政措施来进行管理。如四川安岳龙台供销社将该乡第十三农业社社员梅崇光贩运的原值三元七角七分的四十七件竹器强迫以二元八角九分的价格收购了去。广东南海罗岗圩一个农民因套购三千斤肥料，而被判处一年半的徒刑（编者按：这个判决应该重新考虑）；鹤山、番禺等县曾出动民兵逮捕私宰生猪的农民。有的地区还命令农业社或农民开设的店铺限期结束营业。有的在市场检查发现不是自产自销和自用的商品，即不准买卖，甚至没收。这种生硬的甚至是错误的做法，不但得不到预期的效果，而且必然会引起农民的严重不满。河北邢台、邯郸等地宣布禁止农民经商以后，有些农民的商业活动在由明转暗，偷运麻皮、土布到外地出售的现象比以前更为严重，仅邢台查获的贩麻农民就有七千多人。湖南省的浏阳、醴陵毗邻江西，由于生猪地区差价大，农民纷纷贩运到江西边境各地出售。经干部干涉后，农民反成群结伙，手持棍棒，夜间押运生猪去江西，干部也不敢再过问了。
    可见，对于农民贸易的领导和管理单纯采取行政措施，是十分错误的，也是要使工作陷于被动的。对待农民经商问题，必须加强政策宣传教育，同时采取一些经济措施。
    在这方面，有些地区已经摸索出来一些办法。如广东省提出了根据不同情况，对经商的农民分别进行安排的原则：（一）对已转入农业的小商贩，如果当地市场需要，本人有经营技术，转入农业社后的收入又不能维持自己的生活的，在不影响当地商贩安排的情况下，经过批准，可发给临时牌照营业；（二）对一般农民经商的，应该说服教育，让他安心生产；已转入农业社的半农半商户，一般不应再从事商业；（三）对“五保”户经商的，由农业社在副业生产中加以安排。广东省东莞县开放自由市场初期，农民经商的有二百三十多人，根据上述原则安排了九十九人，其中有五十多人发给了商业牌照，其他的人安排从事副业或手工业生产。经过这样安排，农民经商活动基本上已经停止了。
    要妥善地解决农民经商问题，还应该帮助农业社更好地规划农副业生产。要帮助农业社根据当地条件和技术能力，开展多种经营，适当安排劳动力，使人尽其才，地尽其利，物尽其用。浙江龙游志檀乡八个农业社重新规划生产以后，扩大了莲子种植面积，恢复和新开辟了养山羊、鱼秧、种花生、桑叶等多种农副业生产门路；灵山乡增产农业社重行安排劳力后，恢复了五座炭窑，开展了副业生产，增加了社员收入。这样农民就安心生产了。同时，在农业社内部，还要根据可能条件，适当缩短农业社分配时间和改进预分制度，使社员感到方便，不再因手中缺少零用钱而滋生从事商业活动的思想，使他们能够安心农业生产。
    各地为了正确地开展农民贸易，恢复和建立了不少的农民服务部、交易所、代理行栈等为农民贸易服务的机构。这样做，不仅促进了物资交流，活跃了市场，满足了农民购销要求，节省了农民生产时间，同时也在一定程度上指导了农民贸易的正常开展，协助国家管理了市场。这也是加强对农民贸易的领导的一项重要办法。
