Column: Reactions to Criticism

    Taking Materials Locally
    Letter from the Huoshan Branch of the Anhui Forestry Industry Bureau: The criticism in the People's Daily article "Why Not Use Local Materials?" published on December 12, 1956, is correct regarding our bureau. However, it needs to be explained that we have already purchased more than 4,000 cubic meters of wood in the Yuexi border forest area in the past, and we still have people stationed there for purchasing. However, due to cost prices, the wood we use cannot currently be entirely purchased in Yuexi. We have already submitted a plan to build a highway to higher authorities for approval.
          The Problem Has Been Dealt With
    Letter from the Joint Cooperative of Handicraft Production Cooperatives of Jilin Province: We have, together with the Changchun Municipal Handicraft Cooperative, dealt with the matter of "Should Be Responsible for One's Own Products" published in the People's Daily on December 18, 1956.
        Moldy Cloth Has Been Returned for Repair
    Letter from the Tangshan Daron Dyeing Factory, a joint state-private enterprise in Hebei Province: The criticism in the People's Daily article "Recover the Loss First or Investigate the Responsibility First?" published on August 11, 1956, is correct, and we sincerely accept it. All the moldy cloth has now been returned for re-processing. ×××
    Letter from the Tangshan Wholesale Station of the China Textiles Company, Hebei Province: The criticism of our station in the People's Daily article "Recover the Loss First or Investigate the Responsibility First?" is correct. In order to avoid similar incidents from happening again, our station has added moisture meters and strengthened the inspection system for cloth entering the warehouse.
    Manufacturing High-Quality and Low-Priced Milk Powder
    Letter from the Local State-Operated Anda Milk Powder Factory: The criticism of our factory in the People's Daily article "A Minor Blemish" published on August 7, 1956, is correct. Due to the fact that our factory did not establish a complete system in production management, impurities were mixed into the milk powder. In the future, we must earnestly improve the level of enterprise management, improve the management system, and produce high-quality, low-cost milk powder.

专栏：对批评的反应

    对批评的反应
    正在就地取材
    安徽森林工业局霍山支局来信：人民日报1956年12月12日刊登“为什么不就地取材”一文对我局的批评是正确的。但需要说明：过去我们在岳西边沿林区已采购了四千余立方公尺木材，现在仍派有人进行收购。但由于成本价格的关系，我们用的木材目前还不能全部在岳西采购。关于修公路的计划我们已报上级批示。
          问题已经处理
    吉林省手工业生产合作社联合社来信：1956年12月18日人民日报发表“应该对自己的产品负责”一事，我社已经会同长春市手工业联合社作了处理。
        霉布已经返修
    河北省唐山市公私合营大纶染厂来信：人民日报1956年8月11日刊登“先挽回损失，还是先追查责任”一文的批评是正确的，我们诚恳的接受。现在全部发霉的布匹已重新返修。×××
    中国纺织品公司河北省唐山批发站来信：人民日报发表的“先挽回损失，还是先追查责任”一文对我站的批评是正确的。为了避免再次发生类似事情，我站已增添了测湿器、加强了布匹入库检查制度。
    制造物美价廉的奶粉
    地方国营安达乳粉厂来信：人民日报1956年8月7日刊登“美中不足”一稿对我厂的批评是正确的。由于我厂在生产管理上没有建立起完整的制度，致使奶粉中掺有杂质。今后我们一定要切实提高企业管理水平，健全管理制度，生产出质量好成本低的乳粉来。
