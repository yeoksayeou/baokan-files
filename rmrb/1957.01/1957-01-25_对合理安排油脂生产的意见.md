    Opinions on Rationally Arranging Oil Production
    Qu Zhi
    Jiangsu Province is an important oil crop producing area, with various types of oil factories possessing relatively high production capacity, producing approximately 10% of the country's total oil production annually. Over the past few years, the province's oil industry has played a significant role in meeting the needs for edible and industrial oils. Given the current insufficient supply of chemical fertilizers, oil cake is the best fertilizer in rural Jiangsu, and oil cake can be used to feed pigs to create natural fertilizer. Therefore, the oil industry is currently an important source of fertilizer and feed in rural areas.
    However, the distribution of the oil industry in Jiangsu Province is very unreasonable. Northern Jiangsu is rich in oil crops such as soybeans and peanuts, and farmers have a habit of raising pigs, requiring a large amount of feed, but lacks sufficient oil factories for processing. Meanwhile, large oil factories, which account for about half of the production capacity, are almost 90% concentrated in Southern Jiangsu. Before the unified purchase, many large oil factories purchased a large amount of raw materials from neighboring provinces like Anhui and Shandong to maintain production. Therefore, the supply of oil cake within the province was not very tight. After the unified purchase, raw materials relied entirely on the province's balance. Because most of the small, indigenous oil mills, which dominated the rural areas, were eliminated, the production of large oil factories was maintained. However, farmers had to purchase the oil cake they needed from the state. Due to multiple circulation links, the flow of oil crops and oil cake occurred continuously, which not only affected the timely supply of fertilizer and feed, but also increased circulation costs and raised the price of fertilizer and feed, which was detrimental to both the state and the farmers. In the Xuzhou and Huaiyin areas, the price of selling one jin of soybeans and buying one jin of soybean cake was almost the same.
    To solve this problem, in the past two years, edible oil, export oil, transferred-out oil, and industrial oil for cities were produced as much as possible in large urban oil factories, and some factories suitable for production in oil-producing areas were moved to rural areas. Combined with the implementation of the "three fix" policy, farmers were organized to retain their own oil crops for processing in factories. The farmers generally reacted very well. However, after the autumn harvest in rural areas last year, new contradictions were encountered in the new situation. Many agricultural cooperatives, in order to increase the income of their members and solve the problem of feed supply, generally requested the restoration of indigenous oil pressing. The Huaiyin area restored 1,400 indigenous oil presses. Taixing County, which is rich in peanuts and soybeans, had restored 484 indigenous oil presses by mid-October last year. The situation of large-scale restoration of indigenous oil presses immediately made the relationship between professional oil factories and indigenous oil mills, industry and rural sideline occupations, and workers and farmers tense. The processing contracts signed by professional oil factories and agricultural cooperatives became ineffective. The processing plan of professional oil factories in the third quarter of last year was only 56% completed, and the equipment utilization rate only reached 23.32%. Workers in oil factories such as Tiqing and Chenghuang received only about one yuan besides food in September due to too little production; some only got enough to eat. Due to the blind restoration of indigenous oil pressing, the oil extraction rate was greatly reduced, generally extracting one and a half jin less oil per hundred jin of soybeans.
    Why have rural indigenous oil mills been restored on such a large scale? There are four reasons: First, farmers have always had this habit. Processing the harvested peanuts and soybeans locally can solve both the edible oil and oil cake problems at the same time, which is naturally much more convenient than the professional oil factories ten or twenty li away. Second, pig raising is the main sideline occupation of farmers, and the feed for pigs – bean cake – used to rely mainly on farmers purchasing from other places, in addition to some being solved locally. Now, it is impossible to purchase from other places, and the supply is not timely, so insufficient feed has become a serious threat to the development of pig-raising sideline occupations. Therefore, solving the feed problem locally under possible conditions has become an urgent requirement for farmers. Third, agricultural cooperatives, in order to develop sideline occupations and increase income, organized a portion of the surplus labor force and cooperative members with oil pressing experience to restore the suspended indigenous oil presses. Fourth, farmers believe that the oil cake obtained by sending soybeans and peanuts to oil factories for processing contains too little residual oil and is not nutritious enough for pigs, and they prefer to press it themselves.
    The contradiction between the blind development of indigenous oil pressing and oil industry production has been sharply exposed before us. To increase the oil extraction rate, we cannot allow a large amount of oil to be wasted; to ensure that agricultural cooperative members increase their income, we must also take into account the immediate interests of the farmers. This reflects the contradiction between increasing the oil extraction rate and increasing farmers' income, professional oil factories and cooperative oil mills, and workers and farmers.
    How to solve this contradiction? Some people advocate making more concessions to farmers, first considering the problem of increasing the income of agricultural cooperatives and solving the problem of rural feed, and therefore advocate handing over a portion of professional oil factories to agricultural cooperatives for operation. Some people say that increasing the oil extraction rate is still the main thing, and allowing agricultural cooperatives to blindly restore indigenous oil pressing will only waste oil and reduce farmers' income. Based on my personal understanding, I would like to offer a few suggestions for discussion.
    First, in order to increase the enthusiasm of farmers for planting oil crops and to supply the farmers in the main oil-producing areas with the necessary fertilizer and feed in a timely manner, we should consider gradually and appropriately adjusting the distribution of oil processing plants in Jiangsu Province. In Jiangsu Province as a whole, the northern Jiangsu area, which is rich in oil crops, especially the Xuzhou and Huaiyin regions, should appropriately increase a portion of oil processing plants. The southern Jiangsu area, where oil factories are excessively concentrated, can be gradually reduced. Within the scope of a county, oil processing should also be distributed as rationally as possible to facilitate the masses.
    However, while maintaining professional oil factories, we cannot completely exclude the restoration of indigenous oil mills. Because, even after the reasonable adjustment of professional oil factories, there is still a phenomenon of insufficient processing in some remote areas. In these areas far from professional oil factories, a portion of indigenous oil mills should be restored in a planned manner according to the amount of oil crops retained by farmers. When restoring indigenous oil mills, we should pay attention to preventing blind practices that do not analyze the conditions and rush into action. Because blindly developing indigenous oil pressing may not be beneficial to increasing farmers' income. Many of the indigenous oil presses that were blindly restored in rural Taixing County in October last year have closed down, and only 240 remain. We surveyed 15 indigenous oil mills, and 10 of them lost money, 5 broke even or had a slight surplus. One cooperative used 130 yuan to restore a small indigenous oil press, which stopped operating after only two pressings.
    Second, rural professional oil factories should still be temporarily managed by the industrial departments until the agricultural cooperatives have the ability to accept and manage them. Because a small oil factory generally has ten oil presses and can process 600,000 jin of peanuts per year. In a relatively concentrated peanut production area like Taixing County, the peanuts produced by 2,500 farmers are needed to meet the production needs of this oil factory, which is clearly not something that an agricultural cooperative can operate. Transferring professional oil factories to agricultural cooperatives will not only fail to fully utilize the equipment utilization rate, but also increase the burden on agricultural cooperatives.
    It should be admitted that the existing professional oil factories have shortcomings in their management methods and are not very convenient for farmers. However, under the principle of taking into account the increase in the oil extraction rate and the convenience of farmers, the management methods can be improved according to the needs of the farmers. According to the experience of Taixing County, before the oil crops are on the market, the state can plan in advance to store a certain amount of oil cake. After the oil crops are on the market, the state can exchange the stored oil cake with farmers for their own portion of oil crops according to a reasonable ratio on a break-even basis. This can meet the seasonal needs of farmers for oil cake and maintain the normal production of professional oil factories. In villages far from the oil factories, in order to solve the difficulty of transportation for farmers, the oil factories can also organize workers to deliver the oil and oil cake to the door for exchange. Since late October last year, professional oil factories in Jiangsu Province have adopted a series of improvement measures and actively increased the oil extraction rate and reduced processing costs, providing convenience to farmers in all aspects, which has been welcomed by farmers. By late November, the oil processed by professional oil factories accounted for 50% of the oil that should be processed.
    Third, actively carry out propaganda and education to farmers, explaining that mechanical oil pressing can increase the oil extraction rate, which is beneficial to the country and also beneficial to farmers. In fact, the oil cake produced after mechanical oil pressing still contains about 4% oil, which is enough for the nutrition of pigs. Moreover, many people in Taixing County use barley and coarse feed instead of oil cake to feed pigs very fat and large; and barley and coarse feed do not contain much oil. Increasing the oil extraction rate and increasing farmers' income are not contradictory in themselves. The problem lies in making farmers realize from their own experience that mechanical oil pressing is beneficial to both the country and the farmers through specific work.
    Fourth, in addition to adjusting the distribution of existing professional oil factories and improving management methods, it is also necessary to build more small oil factories in the form of handicraft industry, depending on local conditions and according to the specific conditions of various places, within the limits of national investment.
    In order to better utilize resources, different treatments should be given to various oil crops. The oil cake of soybeans and peanuts is an important fertilizer and feed for farmers, and decentralized production is necessary. The production of rapeseed oil is in the busy farming season, and the production cost of indigenous oil pressing is more than twice that of mechanical oil pressing, which is suitable for more concentrated production. As for cottonseed, which is an oil crop with high economic value, decentralized production is not only costly but also wastes valuable resources. It is best to concentrate production on a larger scale near cotton-producing areas, with convenient transportation and sufficient power supply.

    对合理安排油脂生产的意见
    瞿之
    江苏省是油料作物的重要产区，各种类型的油厂都拥有较高的生产能力，每年生产的油脂约占全国总产量10％。几年来，全省油脂工业在满足人民食用油和工业用油的需要方面，起了很大的作用。在目前化学肥料供应不足的情况下，油饼是江苏农村中最好的肥料，而油饼又可以通过喂猪来制造自然肥料，因此，油脂工业又是目前农村肥料和饲料的重要来源。
    可是，江苏省油脂工业的布局很不合理。苏北地区盛产大豆、花生等油料作物，而且农民有养猪习惯，需要大量的饲料，但是缺乏足够的油脂工厂加工。而生产能力占一半左右的大型油厂，几乎90％都集中在苏南。统购前，许多大型油厂每年从邻省安徽、山东等地采购大批原料维持生产。因此，省内油饼的供应量不十分紧张。统购后，原料全靠本省平衡，由于在农村中占优势的土榨小油坊大部分被淘汰，大型油厂的生产还是维持了下来，只是农民自己所需要的油饼也得向国家购买，由于周转环节多，不断发生油料作物和油饼的对流现象，不仅影响了肥料饲料的及时供应，而且增加了流转费用，提高了肥料饲料的价格，对国家对农民都不利。在徐州和淮阴地区，农民出售一斤豆子和买进一斤豆饼的价格几乎相等。
    为了解决这个问题，过去两年中，曾将城市食用油、出口油、外调油、工业用油尽量放在城市的大油厂生产，把一些适宜于在油料地区生产的工厂向农村迁移；并且结合“三定”政策的贯彻，组织农民自留油料到工厂加工。农民普遍反映很好。可是，去年农村秋收以后，在新的情况下，又遇到了新的矛盾。许多农业社为了增加社员收入、解决饲料供应问题，普遍要求恢复土榨。淮阴专区恢复了一千四百部土榨。盛产花生大豆的泰兴县，去年10月中旬已恢复了土榨四百八十四部。大批土榨恢复的形势，一下子就使专业油厂和土榨油坊，工业和农村副业，工人和农民的关系紧张起来。专业油厂和农业社订的加工合同都不生效了，去年第三季度专业油厂的加工计划只完成56％，设备利用率只达到23.32％。梯青、城黄等油厂9月份因生产太少，工人除伙食外，只拿到一块钱左右；有的只够吃饭。由于土榨盲目恢复，出油率大大降低，一般每百斤大豆要少榨一斤半油。
    为什么农村土榨油坊会这样大量的恢复起来呢？其原因有四：第一，农民历来有这种习惯。将收下的花生、大豆就地加工，食油和油饼都可以同时解决，比起那十里二十里以外的专业油厂，自然要方便得多。第二，养猪是农民的主要副业，而猪的饲料——豆饼，过去除部分由本地解决外，主要依靠农民到外地采购。现在，向外地采购已不可能，供应又不及时，饲料不足就成了发展养猪副业的严重威胁。因此，在可能条件下，就地解决饲料就成了农民迫切的要求。第三，农业社为了发展副业，增加收入，就组织一部分多余的劳动力和有榨油经验的社员，将停歇的土榨恢复起来。第四，农民认为把大豆、花生送给榨油厂加工得的油饼，残余的油量太少，不够猪的营养，愿意自己榨。
    土榨盲目发展同油脂工业生产的矛盾，已经很尖锐地暴露在我们面前。为了提高出油率，我们不能听任大量油料被浪费；为了保证农业社的社员增加收入，我们又必须照顾到农民眼前的切身利益。这反映了提高出油率同增加农民收入，专业油厂同合作社油坊，工人同农民之间的矛盾。
    如何解决这个矛盾呢？有人主张多向农民让步，首先应该考虑到农业社增加收入和解决农村饲料的问题，因而主张把一部分专业油厂交给农业社去经营。有人说，提高出油率仍是主要的，让农业社盲目恢复土榨，只会浪费油料，减少农民收入。我想根据个人的认识，提出几点商榷性的意见。
    首先，为了提高农民种植油料作物的积极性，及时供应油料主要产区农民所需的肥料和饲料，应该考虑逐步地适当地调整江苏省油料加工厂的布局。就江苏全省范围来说，盛产油料作物的苏北地区，特别是徐州、淮阴等专区，应该适当增加一部分油料加工厂。油厂过分集中的苏南地区可以逐步收缩。从一个县的范围来说，油料加工也应该尽可能的做到布局合理；便利群众。
    但是，在维持专业油厂的同时，不能完全排斥土榨油坊的恢复。因为，即使专业油厂合理调整后，部分偏远地区仍然存在加工不足的现象，在这种离专业油厂偏远的地区，应该根据农民自留油料的数量，有计划地恢复一部分土榨油坊。在恢复土榨油坊时要注意防止不分析条件，一哄而起的盲目做法。因为盲目发展土榨，对农民增加收入未必有利。去年10月泰兴县农村中盲目恢复起来的土榨，停业的很多，目前仅剩下二百四十部。我们调查了十五户土榨油坊，其中就有十户赔本，五户保本或略有盈余，有一个社用一百三十元恢复起来的小土榨，只榨两次就停业了。
    其次，农村的专业油厂，在农业社还没有能力接受和管理的情况下，仍应暂由工业部门管理。因为一个小型油厂，一般都有十部油榨，每年可以加工花生六十万斤。像泰兴县这样一个花生产量较集中的地区，也要二千五百户农民生产的花生才能满足这个油厂生产的需要，这显然不是一个农业社所能经营的。将专业油厂移交给农业社，不仅不能充分发挥设备利用率，还会增加农业社的负担。
    应该承认，现有的专业油厂在经营方法上是有缺点的，对农民说来是不很方便的。但是，在照顾到提高出油率、又照顾到农民方便的原则下，经营方法是可以根据农民的需要来改进的。根据泰兴县的经验，在油料作物上市以前，可以由国家事先有计划地贮存一定数量的油饼，待油料作物上市后，国家即以贮存的油饼，按照不赔不赚的原则，规定一个合理的比例，向农民兑换属于自己部分的油料作物。这样就可以满足农民对油饼的季节性需要，又能维持专业油厂的正常生产。在离油厂较远的乡村，为了解决农民运送不便的困难，油厂也可以组织工人把油和油饼送上门去兑换。去年10月下旬以来，江苏省各专业油厂采取了一系列的改进措施，并积极提高出油率，降低加工费用，各方面尽量给农民方便，受到农民欢迎。到11月下旬，各专业油厂所加工的油料已占应加工油料的50％。
    第三，积极向农民进行宣传教育，说明机械榨油能提高出油率，对国家有利，对农民也有利。事实上，机械榨油后出的油饼仍含油4％左右，足够猪的营养。而且泰兴县很多群众不用油饼，用大麦和粗饲料也同样把猪喂得很肥很大；而大麦和粗饲料中并不含多少油分。提高出油率和增加农民收入本身并不矛盾，问题在通过具体工作，使农民从切身经验中认识到机械榨油对国家对农民都有好处。
    第四，除调整现有专业油厂的布局，改进经营方法外，在国家投资许可的条件下，因地制宜，根据各地的具体情况，多办一些工场手工业形式的小油厂，也是必要的。
    为了更好地利用资源，对各种油料作物还应作不同的处理。大豆和花生的油饼，是农民的重要肥料饲料，分散生产是必要的。而菜籽油的生产正值农忙季节，土榨生产成本又高出机械榨油一倍以上，适宜于较集中的生产。至于棉籽是经济价值很高的油料，分散生产不仅成本高，而且浪费了贵重的资源，最好是接近棉产区，在交通方便而有充足电力供应的条件下，较大规模的集中生产。
