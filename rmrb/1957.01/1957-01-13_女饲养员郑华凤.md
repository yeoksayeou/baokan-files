    Female Swineherd Zheng Huafeng
    Chen Zhengtao
    The pig farm of Lianyige Agricultural Cooperative in Shizhu Township, Jinyun County, Zhejiang Province, has seventy pigs, all of which have been raised by a 47-year-old female swineherd, Zheng Huafeng, since July of last year. Because she raises them so well, none of these pigs have been sick, and every single one of them is fat. The newly purchased pigs averaged only seventeen jin each, but now they weigh sixty-five jin each. The work points she earned from raising pigs exceeded those earned by local male laborers. Zheng Huafeng was named a county-level first-class labor model at the county-wide labor model conference; she was named a pig-raising model at the county women's representative conference, and was selected as a representative to attend the provincial women's representative conference.
    Initially, the cooperative divided the pig-raising duties between her and Chen Fengchai, with her raising forty-eight pigs and Chen Fengchai raising twenty-two pigs. In less than five days, Fengchai refused to continue, so Zheng Huafeng took over all the pig-raising work. Seventy pigs need to eat 2,700 jin of pig feed every day. How could one person cook that much? Her solution was to cook the feed for the next morning the night before. Two large pots were in constant use, day and night. Her husband helped her carry the water for cooking the feed. When the pigs were first bought, they would bite each other. Fearing that the smaller ones would be bitten to death or injured, she slept next to the pigpen for half a month to watch over them. Soon after, she also noticed that the pigs were of different sizes. When they ate together, the smaller ones would not get enough to eat, so she fed them in batches, dividing them into three groups: large, medium, and small. The larger ones ate slightly worse feed, while the smaller ones ate better feed, so that the pigs would grow evenly. She paid close attention to keeping the feed at the right temperature and consistency so that the pigs would not easily get sick. Whenever the pigs were eating, she would carefully observe whether they were full and whether their bowel movements were normal. When she saw that a small pig's stool was loose, she would stir-fry bran in a pot to make it easier for the pig to digest. She also burned oil-tea cakes into ash and mixed it into the feed, which could kill bacteria. She would touch the water used to wash pots that was brought by the cooperative to check for any hard objects before using it. She also did a good job of cleaning and sanitizing the pigsty, disinfecting it with lime water once a week and not leaving any leftover food in the pig troughs.
    This is how Zheng Huafeng excellently performed her duties as a swineherd. She worked very hard all day long, but she was also very happy. She said, "The cooperative is our home. We should do our best to raise the pigs well, so that everyone can increase their income and live a good life."

    女饲养员郑华凤
    陈正涛
    浙江缙云县石?乡联一农业社的养猪场有七十只猪，从去年7月到现在，全由一个四十七岁的女饲养员郑华凤饲养着。由于饲养得好，这些猪一直没有生过病，只只猪都肥肥的。新买来的猪平均每只仅有十七斤，如今已有六十五斤重了。她饲养猪所得的工分超过了当地男劳动力所得的工分。郑华凤在全县劳动模范会上被评为县一等劳动模范；在县妇女代表大会上被评为养猪模范，并选为出席全省妇女代表大会的代表。
    最初，合作社把猪分给她和陈凤钗两人喂养，她养四十八只，陈凤钗养二十二只。不到五天，凤钗就不肯干了，郑华凤就把养猪工作全部包了下来。七十只猪每天要吃二千七百斤猪食，一个人怎样煮得过来呢？她的办法是：头一天晚上就烧好第二天早晨喂的饲料。两口大锅，一天到晚没空歇。煮饲料用的水叫她的丈夫帮助挑。猪刚买来的时候，相互啃咬。她怕小的被咬死压伤，一连半个月睡在猪栏旁看守。不久，她又发现猪大小不一，在一起吃食，小的吃不饱，她就分批饲养，分大中小三批，大的吃差一些，小的吃好些，使猪生长均匀。她很注意使饲料冷热适当、粘糊，使猪吃了不易生病。每当猪吃食的时候，她都留心观察猪是否吃饱了，大便好不好。看到小猪大便稀了，她就把糠放在锅里炒过，使猪吃了容易消化。她还把油茶饼烧成灰拌到饲料里，这样可以杀菌。社里挑来的刷锅水，她都先用手摸过，检查有没有硬的东西，然后才放心。猪栏内清洁卫生工作也搞的好，每星期用石灰水消毒一次，猪食槽内不留残食。
    郑华凤就是这样出色地执行自己的饲养员的职务。她一天到晚很辛苦，也很高兴。她说：“合作社就是我们的家，应当尽自己力量来把猪养好，使大家都增加收入，过好日子。”
