Xinhua News Agency, January 9th - According to TASS, Damascus, January 8th: "Al Ayyam" states that Syrian political circles believe that "Eisenhower's message seeks to protect the oil and other interests of imperialist countries in the Middle East. This message disregards the right to self-determination of the people in this region, which is clearly contrary to the United Nations Charter."

The newspaper, in discussing the economic "aid" to Middle Eastern countries mentioned in Eisenhower's message, emphasized that the purpose of this "aid" is to attempt to make Arab countries "abandon their policy of active neutrality and worsen relations with the Soviet Union, which is contrary to the national interests of these countries and the policies they pursue."

"Al-Jamahir" stated that this message once again proves the imperialist conspiracy to undermine the independence and sovereignty of Arab countries.

"Al-Nour" pointed out that Eisenhower's message is a serious harbinger of imperialist armed intervention in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries. It said that Arabs will not allow imperialist rule to be imposed on them again under any circumstances.

"Al-Fajer" wrote that Arabs firmly oppose the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and tell him that "this is absolutely impossible."

"Alef Baa" condemned Eisenhower's message and exposed the claim in the message of so-called "Soviet interference" in the internal affairs of the Middle East.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 9th - Many Indian newspapers continue to criticize the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

The Hindi "Nava Bharat Times" on the 8th asked in its editorial: "If the United States wishes to achieve peace in West Asia, then why did it not intervene when Britain and France invaded Egypt? Why is it now talking about conducting separate and independent military intervention under the protection of the United Nations?"

"Amrita Bazar Patrika" on the 7th accused the United States of inheriting the mantle of British and French imperialists after they suffered a disgraceful defeat in Egypt. The newspaper's editorial condemned the United States' so-called hypocritical excuse of a "threat of aggression from countries under the control of international communism" in the region, and pointed out: "On the contrary, the most barbaric aggression comes from countries that are not controlled by international communism but belong to the United States' own camp."

The newspaper also pointed out, "It is strange that it is to prevent communist aggression, not to prevent non-communist aggression that has actually occurred." The editorial said: "Obviously, the motive for doing so is to use military aid to set Middle Eastern countries against each other," which "is tantamount to interfering in the affairs of other people."

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 9th - Many newspapers in Jakarta continue to denounce the "Eisenhower Doctrine" as a threat to world peace.

Today's editorial in "Indonesia Torch" said that Eisenhower's plan is a provocation. He wants to push the world down the road to war. The newspaper said that using force to "suppress" communism means dealing with the oppressed and exploited people all over the world.

"Republika"'s editorial believes that Eisenhower's policy is to maintain and expand American power in the Middle East, which will inevitably be rejected by Arab countries with self-respect and love of peace. This divisive policy is doomed to failure.

"Renmin Ribao" commented that, obviously, Eisenhower wants to intervene in Middle Eastern countries under the stale pretext of using force to prevent so-called "communist infiltration," launch a "new Korean War," and continue to dream of ruling the world. But the strong will of the Middle Eastern countries, the united strength of Asian and African countries, and the democratic forces of the whole world will once again thwart this plan of the American warmongers.

"Renmin Ribao" believes that in today's tense situation in the Middle East, it is necessary to convene the Second Asian-African Conference as soon as possible.

    谴责美国企图在中东扩张势力
    叙利亚“光明报”：阿拉伯人决不让帝国主义重新统治中东
    印度“甘露市场报”：侵略威胁来自美国阵营而非共产主义
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社大马士革8日讯：“旷野报”说，叙利亚政界认为，“艾森豪威尔的咨文所追求的目的是保卫帝国主义国家在中东地区的石油利益及其他利益。这个咨文无视这个地区的人民的自决权利，这显然是与联合国宪章相抵触的”。
    这家报纸在谈到艾森豪威尔的咨文中所说的对中东国家的经济“援助”的时候着重指出，这种“援助”的目的是企图使阿拉伯国家“放弃积极的中立政策，同苏联的关系恶化，而这是同这些国家的民族利益以及它们所执行的政策相违背的”。
    “群众日报”说，这个咨文再一次证明帝国主义阴谋破坏阿拉伯国家的独立和主权。
    “光明报”指出，艾森豪威尔的咨文是帝国主义武装干涉中东国家内政的严重预兆。它说，但是阿拉伯人无论如何也不能让帝国主义的统治再强加在自己的身上。
    “先锋报”写道，阿拉伯人坚决反对“艾森豪威尔主义”，并且告诉他“这是决不可能的”。
    “阿利夫巴报”谴责艾森豪威尔的咨文，并且揭露了咨文中所谓“苏联干涉”中东内政的说法。
    据新华社新德里9日电　印度许多报纸继续抨击“艾森豪威尔主义”。
    8日的印地文“新印度时报”在社论中问道：“如果美国希望实现西亚和平，那末为什么它在英法两国侵略埃及的时候不进行干涉呢？为什么它现在要谈在联合国的庇护下进行单独的、独立的军事干涉呢？”
    “甘露市场报”7日指责美国在英法帝国主义者在埃及遭到了可耻的失败以后继承了它们的衣钵。这家报纸的社论谴责美国所谓的这一地区“来自国际共产主义控制的国家的侵略威胁”这种虚伪的借口，它指出：“相反地，最野蛮的侵略却来自不由国际共产主义控制而是属于美国自己那个阵营的国家。”
    报纸还指出，“古怪的是，它是为了防止共产主义的侵略，而不是防止实际上已经发生的非共产主义方面的侵略。”社论说：“显而易见，这样做的动机是要用给予军事援助的办法来使中东国家互相对立起来，”这“等于是干涉别国人民的事务”。
    新华社雅加达9日电　雅加达的许多报纸继续指斥“艾森豪威尔主义”是危害世界和平的。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”今天的社论说，艾森豪威尔的计划是一种挑衅。他想把世界推向战争的道路。这家报纸说，用武力“镇压”共产主义，意味着对付全世界被压迫和被剥削的人民。
    “共和国报”的社论认为，艾森豪威尔的政策是为了要维持和扩张美国在中东的势力，这必然要遭到有自尊心和热爱和平的阿拉伯国家的拒绝。这个分裂政策是注定要失败的。
    “人民日报”评论说，显然，艾森豪威尔想以使用武力阻止所谓“共产党渗透”的陈腐借口来干预中东国家，发动“新朝鲜战争”，继续梦想统治世界。但是中东国家的坚强意志，亚非国家的团结力量和全世界的民主力量，将再一次挫败美国战争贩子这个计划。
    “人民日报”认为，在中东面临着紧张局势的今天，有必要迅速召开第二次亚非会议。
