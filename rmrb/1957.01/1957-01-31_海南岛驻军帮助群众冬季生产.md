Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, 29th - Officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army units stationed on Hainan Island are extensively helping local farmers with winter production. Many areas on the island experienced excessive rainfall last December, preventing timely planting. During the New Year and Spring Festival period, the stationed officers and soldiers in these areas each devoted three days to helping local farmers rush to plant rice seedlings. A certain unit of the garrison in the Lingshui area successively helped seventeen agricultural production cooperatives with cultivating, weeding, and planting sweet potatoes on a total of over 330 mu, planting over 15,000 sugarcane plants, and constructing ditches, dams, and pools, excavating a total of over 16,000 cubic meters of earth. In the southern regions of Hainan Island, where rainfall is scarce, garrison officers and soldiers have helped farmers dig many wells for irrigation.

During their participation in winter production, officers and soldiers of all units displayed a high degree of enthusiasm for labor. The Fourth Company of a certain unit of the garrison in the Wuzhishan Li ethnic minority area helped Li farmers harvest six mu of rice and then carried the rice over the mountains to their homes. A certain engineering unit responsible for repairing a dam continued to work tirelessly in the dusty and windy conditions, enthusiastically shouting encouraging slogans. Many military dependents also actively participated in the labor. Some units, because the work sites were dozens of miles away from the garrison, carried field stoves to the fields to boil water and cook meals.

The officers and soldiers of the units assisting with winter production were praised by farmers throughout Hainan Island. Many agricultural cooperatives wrote letters of appreciation to the units.

    海南岛驻军帮助群众冬季生产
    新华社海口29日电　驻守在海南岛上的中国人民解放军各部队官兵，大规模地帮助驻地农民冬季生产。岛上的许多地区去年12月份雨量过多，没能及时耕种。这些地区的驻军官兵在新年到春节期间分别抽出三天时间，帮助当地农民抢种稻秧。陵水地区驻军某部先后帮助十七个农业生产合作社耕耘、除草、栽地瓜等共三百三十多亩，种甘蔗一万五千多株，修筑水沟、水坝、水池等共挖土一万六千多立方公尺。在海南岛雨水较少的南部地区，驻军官兵帮助农民打了许多灌溉用的井。
    在参加冬季生产中，各部队官兵表现了高度的劳动热情。五指山黎族聚居区的驻军某部第四连帮助黎族农民收割了六亩稻谷以后，还挑着这些稻谷翻山越岭送到他们家里。担任修水坝的某工兵部队在尘土飞扬的大风里，官兵们仍然不停地干活，还兴高采烈地高呼着鼓动口号。部队的许多随军家属也积极参加了劳动。有些部队因为工作地点远离驻地几十里，就挑着行军锅到田野上烧水做饭。
    帮助冬季生产的部队官兵受到海南岛各地农民们的赞扬。许多农业社给部队写了慰问信。
