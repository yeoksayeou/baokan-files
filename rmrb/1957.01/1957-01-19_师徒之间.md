    Between Teacher and Apprentice
    By Our Correspondent Yuan Liang
    Wang Baohong climbed out of bed, ate something quickly, and hurried out.
    The factory gate was closed, and the entrance was deserted. He thought that probably the night shift workers had all left. He immediately blamed himself, "How did I oversleep again?"
    He hurried forward and knocked on the door.
    The guard, after finding out why he was there, smiled and said, "It's only a little after eleven o'clock now."
    "Go on! You can't just stand here admiring the moon." The guard urged.
    The streetlamp at the alleyway shone with a cold light, and everything around was silent. He decided to go to Master Zhang's house.
    Wang Baohong didn't immediately go forward to knock on the door. He considered that his master had been suffering from stomach problems for the past few days and wasn't in good spirits, and he regretted disturbing him so late at night. A gust of cold wind drove him closer to the window, and he whispered, "Mom, Mom! Open the door."
    "What's wrong now?!" Under the light, his master's wife revealed a panicked expression.
    "It's nothing. I got up too late yesterday, and I got up too early today!" Wang Baohong was a little embarrassed.
    "Thank goodness. Hurry up and get into bed!" His master's wife busied herself making up the bed for him.
    "This won't do! Being late affects work, and being too early affects sleep." Master Zhang sat up in bed, putting on his cotton-padded coat, and said, "Young people need more sleep. How about this, tomorrow you move that wall clock over there, so you can keep track of the time."
    "What about over there?"
    "There's another one over there."
    "Alright!" Saying that, Wang Baohong got into bed with his clothes on and fell asleep without a worry.

    After getting off work at noon, Wang Baohong carried the wall clock home with both hands. He was very proud. As soon as he entered the room, he patted his wife's shoulder and said, "Hey! You're in charge of the time from now on. I'm going to set the clock a little fast, and you're not allowed to complain!" Saying that, his wife smiled shyly. His mother sat on the kang, stopped her needlework, and said with a grateful heart, "To have such a good master!"
    Just two days ago, the factory had allocated a room to Baohong, asking him to move his wife over from her aunt's house. Wang Baohong needed to set up his own home. But at the time, apart from two bedding rolls and some clothes, he lacked furniture and other necessities. He was quite worried.
    On the day before moving, he and Meng Xianli went to his master's house.
    As soon as they stepped over the threshold, they found a half sack of things in the kitchen. Meng Xianli touched it, and it rattled inside. Out of curiosity, he turned around and asked his master's wife, "Mom! What's in that package in the kitchen?" "Go and take a look!" His master's wife said, "Setting up a home isn't easy! You can't be without anything. That's what your master put together for Baohong." "Oh my!" Meng Xianli opened the sack and said in surprise, "Pots, pans, pickles, soy sauce, sorghum rice... everything you need to eat and use is here."
    Tears welled up in Wang Baohong's eyes, and he stammered as he asked his master's wife, "Mom! When should I return these to you?" "Return them tomorrow! And with interest!" His master's wife said with some dissatisfaction. "The more this child grows, the more crafty he becomes."
    "Let's go! Don't make Mom angry." Meng Xianli pulled Baohong and carried the things away.

    Wang Baohong was working as usual when suddenly Master Zhao walked past him. He was surprised, "Master Zhao, aren't you on the night shift? Why are you here now?"
    "The shifts are swapped around a bit, there's some urgent work. Is your current job finished?"
    "There's plenty more, there's still a big pile following behind!"
    As soon as Wang Baohong finished the first job, Master Zhao came over again and said, "The foreman wants me to use your lathe..."
    Wang Baohong was a little confused by this. He thought: Are we switching lathes? Wouldn't that mess things up again? I need to ask the foreman. Thinking this, Wang Baohong walked towards the workshop office and happened to meet Foreman Lin on the way. "Foreman Lin: Tell me, why do you want me to switch lathes?"
    "There's a very urgent job that requires precision, and workers with low skills can't do it."
    "What job?"
    "To process a bakelite mold for another factory. You quickly pack up and go rest."
    "If it's just to solve this, there's no need to swap shifts. Can I do it?" He straightforwardly made the request.
    "No!" "This requires a seventh-grade worker to do. Otherwise, if it's ruined, who's responsible?"
    "Ruined?" Wang Baohong was a little unconvinced, "If it's ruined, I'll compensate!"
    "Whether you compensate or not is a small matter, delaying the work is a big matter!"
    The team leader, Li Guanghe, understood him. "I think it can be done," Li Guanghe said to Foreman Lin. "As long as he concentrates, I think it'll be fine. Let him do it!"
    Foreman Lin pondered for a while and agreed with Li Guanghe's opinion. As he handed Baohong the blueprints, he said, "Alright, but you absolutely can't ruin it!"
    After a while, Master Zhang also came, and Wang Baohong told him about what had happened, from beginning to end.
    Master Zhang looked at the blueprints and said, "This job is very precise! One platform here, one groove there, you can't be careless at all! If you're going to do it, you have to start from the top, milling down layer by layer..." Master Zhang gave some instructions, watched him change the cutters and secure the workpiece, and then walked away.
    As soon as Master Zhang got to the office, he couldn't sit still. Although he believed that Wang Baohong's skills were up to the task and that he was dedicated to his work, it was still his first time doing this kind of job! He quickly turned back and saw Wang Baohong operating the lathe very fast, his eyes staring straight at the cutter head, with beads of sweat on his forehead. He couldn't help but give two more instructions: "Don't rush, don't panic, stay steady and you can do it well."
    "Don't worry, Master Zhang. I won't let you down!" Wang Baohong's eyes still didn't leave the milling cutter.
    Five hours later, Wang Baohong brought the milled workpiece over. Master Zhang took the item, looked at it over and over, and said happily, "Completely qualified! How many points did it take?"
    "Five points."
    "What's the work-hour quota?"
    "Twelve points."
    "Others may not say it, but they'll be quite envious in their hearts!" Master Zhang looked at Wang Baohong's excited face and said, "But you can't be proud and complacent. You can't let a single leaf block your eyes and prevent you from seeing the distance."
    As he said these words, he was indeed very pleased. He felt that he hadn't wasted his efforts on Baohong. Baohong being able to handle this job showed that his technical level had greatly improved. And just two years ago, Baohong was just a "greenhorn" in his twenties. After arriving at the factory and following him, he became a full apprentice in three months. According to custom, they could go their separate ways. But Baohong wasn't like that, he still came to his master's house every few days to ask this and that. He was most proud of this point about him. He often told his wife, "I just love Baohong's drive!"
    ×××
    On Sunday, Wang Baohong and his fellow apprentices came to Master Zhang's house again. Master Zhang was talking to a guest about something.
    Seeing them come in, Master Zhang stood up from his seat and said, "This is Master Wu from the Low-Voltage Switch Factory. We've worked together since we were young, and he's very knowledgeable about spiral milling (automatic milling machine)." Turning back, he said to Master Wu, "Jianzhi, even though you're in the low-voltage (switch factory) now and I'm in the high-voltage (switch factory), it's still like we're together. You absolutely can't treat my apprentices as outsiders. If they have any problems that they're 'stuck' on, they'll still have to ask you." Master Wu nodded and said, "That goes without saying. In the future, if you have any problems, just 'work them out' together."
    After Master Wu finished talking about the performance of the spiral milling machine, Master Zhang handed over a cup of hot tea and said, "I think we should just talk about this for today! You can't remember too much. Let them go and look at the real thing again." "That's fine. If I don't explain things clearly, there are others..."
    "I told them earlier that no matter how much my master knows, apprentices can't say that learning this much is enough!" Master Wu's words again stirred Master Zhang's thoughts, "Jianzhi: If technology doesn't 'evolve,' and we just follow our old ways, we won't be able to step into socialism in eight lifetimes! I have only one hope for them, that their skills can surpass ours!"
    Originally, there was no automatic milling machine in their tool workshop. A few days ago, Wang Baohong went to the repair workshop and saw this thing, and he became a little greedy. When he returned to the workshop, he asked Master Zhang a lot of questions about spiral milling machines, which Master Zhang couldn't answer all at once. So he told him, "Wait for me to check it out when I get back, and I'll tell you tomorrow."
    When he returned home, his wife had already prepared the meal. "Let's eat!" "Okay." He verbally agreed with his wife, but he opened his small bookcase and took out several books.
    His wife brought the bowl of rice to him, and he kept flipping through his notebook while picking up the steaming noodles with his chopsticks. The steam from the bowl made his reading glasses "sweat" from time to time, and he had to put down his chopsticks to wipe his glasses. Seeing his uncomfortable expression, his wife wanted to persuade him, "Can't you look at it after you finish eating?" "I can't eat, you put it away."
    It was past ten o'clock, and Master Zhang's eyelids were heavy, but he still hadn't found the answer he was looking for. He squinted and sat quietly. "Go to bed!" This was the third time his wife had urged him to sleep. "You go to sleep first! I have to go out." Saying that, he went out. He went to Master Wu's house to "call for reinforcements."

    师徒之间

    王宝洪从床上爬起来，随便吃了点东西，拔腿就走。
    工厂的大门掩闭着，门口冷冷清清的。他想大概是夜班工人都走光了。当即埋怨自己说：“我怎么又睡过了点呢？”
    他紧迈几步上去叩门。
    警卫问明了他的来意后，笑了笑说：“现在才十一点多钟。”
    “快走吧！反正不能站在这里送月亮。”警卫同志催促着。
    巷口的电灯闪着寒光，四周鸦雀无声。他决定到张师傅家里去。
    王宝洪没有立刻上前叫门。他考虑到师傅这几天闹胃病，精神不大好，又有些后悔不该半夜到这里来打扰他。阵阵的寒风驱使他走近窗户低声喊道：“娘，娘！开门。”
    “又出什么事了？！”灯光下师娘露出了惊慌的脸色。
    “没有什么。昨天起的太迟，今天又起得太早啦！”王宝洪有点不好意思。
    “谢天谢地。快上炕睡吧！”师娘忙着给他收拾铺盖。
    “你这样不行呀！迟到了影响工作，贪早了又影响睡眠。”张师傅从被窝里坐起来，一边披着棉衣说：“年轻人瞌睡多。这样吧，明天你把那个挂钟搬去，好把握住点时间。”
    “这边呢？”
    “这边还有一个。”
    “好吧！”说着，王宝洪就和衣钻进了被筒，放心地入睡了。			×××
    中午下班后，王宝洪双手捧着挂钟回家去。他很得意。一进房门就拍着他妻子的肩膀说：“喂！以后由你掌握时间。我要把钟拨快一些，可不兴你提意见！”说着，他爱人腼腆地笑了。母亲坐在炕头上，停下了手里的针线活，充满着感激的心情说：“有这样好的师傅！”
    就在前两天，厂里给宝洪匀了一间房子，要他把爱人从姨娘家搬过来。王宝洪需要自己安家了。可是当时他除过两个铺盖卷和贴身衣服以外，家具杂物什么都缺。心里挺犯愁。
    搬家的头一天，他和孟宪利到师傅家里去。
    他们刚刚踏进门坎，就发现厨房里放着半麻袋东西。孟宪利顺手摸了一下，里面还钉铃当啷乱响。他出于好奇，转回头来问师娘道：“娘！厨房里那一包是装的啥？”“你去看看！”师娘说：“要安个家，不容易呀！什么东西也少不了。那是你师傅给宝洪攒掇的。”“哎呀！”孟宪利解开麻袋，惊讶地说：“锅碗瓢盆、咸菜大酱、高粱米……吃的用的都有了。”
    王宝洪眼角里涌出了热泪，他结结巴巴地问师娘道：“娘！那我什么时候还给你呀？”“明天就还！还要出利钱呢！”师娘不大满意地说。“这孩子越长心眼越多了。”
    “走吧！别惹娘生气了。”孟宪利拉住宝洪抬着东西走了。×××
    王宝洪像平常一样在干活，突然赵师傅从他身边走过。他感到奇怪：“赵师傅，你不是夜班，怎么现在就来了？”
    “班次错开一下，有点紧要活。你这个活干完了还有没有活啦？”
    “有的是，还有一大堆在屁股后头跟着呢！”
    王宝洪刚下了头一个活，赵师傅又走过来说：“工长叫我用用你的床子……。”
    这句话弄得王宝洪有些莫名其妙。他想：要调床子么？那不是又乱套了？我得去问问工长。想着，王宝洪就向车间办公室走去，恰好在路上遇到了林工长。“林工长：你说说，什么原因要让我换床子？”
    “有个特急活，要求又精密，技术低的干不了。”
    “什么活？”
    “给外厂加工一个胶木模子。你快收拾一下，休息去。”
    “就是为了解决这个，那也用不着错班，我来干行不行？”他口直心快地提出了要求。
    “不行！”“这要七级工匠才能干。不然，干废了，谁负责？”
    “干废了？”王宝洪有些不服气，“干废了我包赔！”
    “赔不赔是小事，误了活是大事！”
    还是带班工长李广和了解他。“我看，能行，”李工长对林工长说。“只要他精神集中点，我看错不了。叫他干吧！”
    林工长思索了一阵，同意了李工长的意见。他一面给宝洪交着图纸，一面说：“那好，千万可不能干废了！”
    过了一会，张师傅也来了，王宝洪把刚才发生的事情，原原委委说了一遍。
    张师傅看了看图纸说：“这活十分精密！东一个台，西一个沟，丝毫大意不得！要干么，得先从上面下手，一层一层往下铣……。”张师傅给了一番指点，又看着他换好了刀具，卡好了活，就走开了。
    张师傅刚到办公室，就有些坐不住。虽然他相信王宝洪技术能顶下来，干活也用心，但作这种活，究竟还是第一回！他很快又转了回来，看见王宝洪把床子开得飞快，两只眼睛直瞪瞪地瞅着刀头，额上挂着豆粒大的汗珠，由不得又叮咛两句：“别着急，别发慌，稳住点就能干好。”
    “放心吧，张师傅。我不会给你丢脸！”王宝洪眼睛仍然没有离开铣刀。
    五个钟头过后，王宝洪把铣好的活送过来。张师傅接过这个东西，反来复去，看了又看，喜孜孜地说：“完全合格！干了几个点？”
    “五个点。”
    “工时定额是多少？”
    “十二个点。”
    “别人嘴里不说，心里也会挺羡慕的！”张师傅瞧了瞧王宝洪兴奋的脸说，“但是，可不能骄傲自满。不能叫一个树叶遮住眼睛，看不到远处。”
    说这番话的时候，他心里也的确快慰。他觉得在宝洪身上他没有白花工夫。宝洪能顶下这个活来，就说明他的技术水平大大提高了。而在两年前，宝洪才不过是个二十来岁的“白帽子”。到厂以后，跟着他，三个月就满了徒。按常例，他们就可以各干各的了。但是宝洪不是那样，他仍旧三天两头到师傅家里来问这问那。他也最得意他这一点。他常跟老伴说：“我就喜爱宝洪那股钻劲！”×××
    星期天，王宝洪和他的师兄弟们又到张师傅家里来，张师傅正在和客人谈论着什么。
    看到他们进来，张师傅从座位上站起来说：“这是低压开关厂的吴师傅。我们自小在一堆干活，他对螺旋铣（自动铣床）很通达。”回过头来，他又对吴师傅说：“健智，现在虽然你在低压（开关厂），我在高压（开关厂），可仍像在一堆一样。千万不能把我的徒弟当成外人，他们有啥问题‘卡’住了，少不了还得去问你。”吴师傅点了点头说：“那是不用说的。以后有啥问题只管在一堆‘琢磨’。”
    吴师傅讲完了螺旋铣的性能，张师傅就递过一杯热茶来说：“我看今儿就先讲到这吧！多了记不住。让他们再去看看实物再说。”“那行。我说得不明白的地方，还有别人……。”
    “我早先就跟他们说过，我师傅会多少，徒弟不能说我就学这么些就够啦！”吴师傅的话又引起了张师傅的心思，“健智：要是技术再不‘进化’，光顺着咱们那些老道道溜，八辈子也迈不到社会主义！我对他们只有一个盼头，盼着他们的手艺能高出咱们一头！”
    本来，他们工具车间里并没有自动铣床，头两天，王宝洪到检修车间去，瞅到了这玩艺，就有些贪心。回到车间，他向张师傅提了一大堆螺旋铣上的问题，张师傅一时哪里能够回答上来。于是告诉他：“等我回去查一查，明儿说给你。”
    当他回到家里，老伴已经把饭做好了。“吃饭吧！”“好。”他嘴里答应着老伴，自己却打开了小书箱，搬出了几本书。
    老伴把饭碗端到他面前，他一边用筷子挑着热腾腾的面条，一边还在不停地翻阅他的笔记本子。碗里的热气，弄得他的老花眼镜一阵阵“发汗”，他只得时而放下筷子去擦他的眼镜片。老伴看到他那股难受劲，就想劝他两句：“吃完饭再看还不行？”“我吃不进，你把它收拾了罢。”
    十点多了，张师傅眼皮也熬涩了，可仍旧没有找到他要找的答案。他眯缝着眼睛，静静地坐着。“快休息吧！”这是老伴第三次催他睡觉的声音。“你先睡吧！我得出去一趟。”说着，他出去了。他到吴师傅家里“搬兵”去了。
