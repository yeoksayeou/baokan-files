Nationwide Construction is in Full Swing

    Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway Under Survey

    XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, Xining, January 1st: The Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway, planned by the state to be over 1,300 kilometers long, completed the preliminary and detailed surveys of the 176-kilometer section from Hekou to Xining, the preliminary survey of the 127-kilometer section from Xining to Ketu Pass in Haiyan County, the rough survey of the over 1,690-kilometer section from Huangyuan to the area west of Mangya in the Qaidam Basin, and the aerial survey of the approximately 1,300-kilometer section from Huangyuan via Delingha to Mahai in the Qaidam Basin in 1956.

    From Huangyuan to the Qaidam Basin, due to the vast area and harsh climate, most of the area is sparsely populated. Using manual ground surveys would create many difficulties in terms of manpower and resources. In order to select an ideal route for developing Qaidam resources as soon as possible, the Ministry of Railways adopted advanced aerial surveying methods on this line.

    The survey of the Xining to Ketu Pass section is the most arduous part of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway. In order to select a reasonable and economical route, in addition to the preliminary survey of a main line, the survey and design personnel also explored alternative lines through many difficult areas for research. During the detailed survey of the Hekou to Xining section, the survey and design personnel conducted detailed investigations and research and found a more ideal route. Currently, construction teams have arrived at various construction sites along this detailed survey line and are actively preparing for various construction tasks.

    Before liberation, Qinghai Province not only had no railways, but not even a decent highway. People of all ethnic groups were very happy to see the arrival of railway surveyors and construction workers, and they are also prepared to further support the construction of the railway.

    Daye Steel Plant Accelerates Expansion

    XINHUA NEWS AGENCY: The expansion project of Daye Steel Plant is progressing rapidly. The amount of work completed last year was eleven times greater than the previous year. The newly expanded electric furnace workshop has already been put into production.

    Walking into the factory area, everything has changed dramatically. All the puddles and potholes of various sizes have been filled into flat ground, and seventeen factory buildings have been built on top of them, including the central laboratory, water tube boiler room, comprehensive repair workshop, gas generating station, air compression station, and scrap steel processing workshop. The famous bunker hill has also been leveled, and is now the demolding workshop with dense steel bars. The factory building part of the open hearth furnace workshop, the key expansion project, has been fully completed; the crane and new charging machine on the operating platform inside the factory building have also been erected; soon, several modern large open hearth furnaces can be installed. In the expanded electric furnace workshop, the newly expanded electric furnaces are of good quality. Since November 15th last year, No. 2 furnace has produced an additional 2,700 tons of steel ingots for the country.

    Workshop for Manufacturing Steam Turbines

    XINHUA NEWS AGENCY: The foundation of the main project of the second phase of construction of Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant—the steam turbine generator workshop—has recently been completed.

    This workshop is a modern workshop designed with the help of the Soviet Union. When the workshop is fully completed, it can manufacture 25,000 kW, 50,000 kW, and strive to manufacture 100,000 kW steam turbine generators. It can also manufacture large and medium-sized AC and DC motors. It will join the steam turbines and boilers produced by Harbin Steam Turbine Plant and Harbin Boiler Plant to form a complete set of modern and huge thermal power equipment to supply the country for the construction of thermal power plants.

    Two Power Plants Under Expansion

    XINHUA NEWS AGENCY: The expansion projects of the Xiaguan and Tianshenggang power plants in Jiangsu Province have recently started one after another. After the completion of the projects, the power generation of these two power plants will be approximately doubled, which will greatly help to alleviate the tight power supply situation in Jiangsu Province.

    Nanjing Xiaguan Power Plant is one of the main power plants in the Nanjing power grid. The area supplied by the Nanjing power grid used approximately four times more electricity for industry and agriculture last year than in 1949, while the power generation equipment of the Nanjing power grid has not increased. After the completion of the Xiaguan Power Plant expansion project in 1958, the tight power supply situation in the Nanjing power grid will be alleviated.

    Nantong Tianshenggang Power Plant is a large power plant in the northern region of Jiangsu Province, but the original equipment in the plant is unbalanced, and the power generation capacity is limited. This expansion project mainly balances the equipment so that the potential of the enterprise can be fully utilized. The expansion project of this power plant will be completed in April this year.

    Fujian Completes Twenty Sugar Factories

    XINHUA NEWS AGENCY: Twenty of the forty new mechanized and semi-mechanized sugar factories built in Fujian Province last year have been completed and put into production.

    These forty new sugar factories are all located in more than ten counties, including Xianyou, Putian, Nan'an, and Yunxiao, which are rich in sugarcane production. After all the sugar factories are put into production, they can crush 3,650 tons of sugarcane per day.

    The sugar industry in Fujian Province was originally very backward. Before liberation, there was not a single mechanized sugar factory in the province, and the required mechanized white sugar had to be supplied from other places. In 1954 and 1955, three mechanized and semi-mechanized sugar factories were successively built, which could crush 380 tons of sugarcane per day; the output of mechanized sugar accounted for only about 10% of the total sugar production in the province. Last year, the total sugarcane output in Fujian Province reached more than 1.15 million tons, an increase of 22% over the previous year. After all forty new sugar factories are put into production, the production volume of mechanized sugar will account for 50% of the total cane sugar production in the province.

    Shaanxi Builds Fifty-Five New Roads

    This Newspaper Reports: Last year, Shaanxi Province started construction of fifty-five roads. Before mid-December last year, forty of them had been completed, with a total length of 1,593 kilometers, equivalent to more than twice the total length of roads built in the six years after liberation. More than 70% of these roads lead to mountainous areas and old revolutionary base areas. Twenty-five of the twenty-six counties in northern Shaanxi have been connected by cars. And with Yan'an and Yulin as the center, a road transportation network has been formed. The Yufu Road from Yulin through Shenmu to Fugu County's old base area was opened to traffic at the end of November; the road from Yulin to Zasak Banner in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has also been completed. From Qingjian to Jiezigou, from Suide to Jiuyuangou, from Wubao to Xinjiagou, and from Jiaxian to Wuzhen, these rugged paths that could only be walked by donkeys in the past can now be accessed by cars. In the mountainous areas of southern Shaanxi, many roads have also been built, the main lines being the Shangman Road from Shangxian through Shanyang County to Manchuanguan and the Hanbei Road from Hanzhong to Beiba. The construction of these roads in Shaanxi last year involved many high mountains and steep ridges, and the project was quite arduous. For example, the Shangman Road has to pass through two mountains with an altitude of 1,300 meters, and the roads need to be built in spirals on the mountain for cars to pass. After the roads are opened to traffic, not only can the mountain areas' native products such as fur, medicinal materials, mushrooms, and fruits be smoothly transported out, but also the salt, cloth, daily necessities, etc. needed by the people in the mountain areas can be transported in a timely manner.

    全国到处忙建设
    兰青铁路正在勘测
    据新华社西宁1日电　国家计划修筑的全长一千三百多公里的兰州—青海铁路，在1956年中已经完成了河口到西宁一百七十六公里的初测和定测、西宁到海晏县的克土垭口一百二十七公里的初测、湟源到柴达木盆地茫崖以西地区一千六百九十多公里的草测和湟源经德令哈到柴达木盆地马海约一千三百公里的航测工作。
    从湟源到柴达木盆地，由于地区辽阔，气候恶劣，大部分是人烟稀少的地方，如用人工在地面上测量会造成许多人力、物力的困难。为了能及早为开发柴达木资源选择一条理想的线路，铁道部在这条线上采用的是先进的航空测量方法。
    在西宁到克土垭口一段的勘测中，是兰青铁路上最艰巨的一段。为了选择一条合理而又经济的路线，除了初测一条正线外，勘测设计人员还通过许多困难地区寻找比较线进行研究。河口到西宁一段的定测工作中，勘测设计人员经过详细调查研究，找到了一段更合理想的线路。目前，这条定测后的线上，施工队伍已经到达各个工地，正积极进行各项施工的准备工作。
    青海省在解放前不仅没有铁路，连一条像样的公路也没有。各族人民看到铁路勘测人员和筑路职工的到来都非常高兴，他们还准备进一步做好修筑铁路的支援工作。
    大冶钢厂加速扩建
    新华社讯　大冶钢厂扩建工程进展很快，去年完成的工作量比前年大十一倍。新扩建的电炉车间已经投入生产。
    走进厂区，一切都大变了。一片洼洼坑坑的大小水塘都填成平地，上面又先后盖起了中心试验室、水管锅炉房、综合修理车间、煤气发生站、空气压缩站和废钢处理车间等十七幢厂房。著名的碉堡山也削平了，如今是钢筋密布的脱放车间。扩建的重点工程平炉车间的厂房部分，已经全部竣工；厂房里面操作台的天车和新的加料机，也架设起来了；不久以后，几座现代化的大型平炉就可以安装完毕。在扩建的电炉车间里，新扩建的几座电炉质量良好，从去年11月15日起，二号炉已经为国家多炼出两千七百吨钢锭。
    制造汽轮机的车间
    新华社讯　哈尔滨电机厂第二期建设的主要工程——汽轮发电机车间，厂房基础已经在最近完成。
    这个车间是苏联帮助设计的一个近代化车间。这个车间全部建成以后，可以制造两万五千瓩、五万瓩并且争取制造十万瓩的汽轮发电机。同时还可以制造大、中型交流和直流电机。它将和哈尔滨汽轮机厂、哈尔滨锅炉厂生产的汽轮机和锅炉联合组成全套的现代化的巨大火力发电设备，供给国家建设火力发电站。
    扩建中的两个发电厂
    据新华社讯　江苏省下关和天生港两个发电厂的扩建工程，最近已经先后开工。工程完工之后，这两个发电厂的发电量都将增加一倍左右，对缓和江苏省电力供应的紧张情况将起很大作用。
    南京下关发电厂是南京电力网主要发电厂之一。由南京电力网负责供电的地区，去年的工农业用电比1949年增加了四倍左右，而南京电力网的发电设备没有增加。下关发电厂的扩建工程在1958年完工以后，南京电力网电力供应紧张的局面将得到缓和。
    南通天生港发电厂是江苏省北部地区一座较大的发电厂，但是厂内原有设备不平衡，发电能力受到限制。这次扩建工程主要是平衡设备，使企业潜力得到充分发挥。这个电厂的扩建工程在今年4月完工。
    福建建成二十个糖厂
    新华社讯　福建省去年新建的四十个机制和半机制糖厂，有二十个已经先后建成投入生产。
    这四十个新建糖厂都在盛产甘蔗的仙游、莆田、南安、云霄等十多个县。全部糖厂投入生产以后，每天能压榨甘蔗三千六百五十吨。
    福建省原来制糖工业非常落后。解放以前，全省没有一个机制糖厂，所需的机制白砂糖，要由外地供应。在1954年和1955年，先后新建三个机制和半机制糖厂，每天能压榨甘蔗三百八十吨；机制糖产量仅占全省制糖总产量的10％左右。去年，福建省甘蔗产量共达一百十五万吨以上，比前年增加22％。新建的四十个糖厂全部投入生产以后，机制糖的生产量，将占全省蔗糖总产量的50％。
    陕西新修公路五十五条
    本报讯　去年陕西省开工修建了五十五条公路，在去年12月中旬以前，已经建成了四十条，总长达一千五百九十三公里，相当于解放后六年来建成公路总长度的两倍以上。这些公路中，有70％以上是通向山区和革命老根据地的。陕北二十六个县，已经有二十五个县通了汽车。并且以延安和榆林为中心，组成了公路运输网。从榆林经过神木通往府谷县老根据地的榆府公路，已经在11月底通车了；从榆林通往内蒙自治区扎萨克旗的公路也修好了。从清涧到介子沟，绥德到韭园沟，吴堡到辛家沟，葭县到乌镇，这些过去只能走毛驴的崎岖小道，现在都能通汽车了。在陕西南部的山区里，也修通了不少公路，主要干线有商县经过山阳县到漫川关的商漫公路和汉中到碑坝的汉碑公路等。陕西去年兴修的这些公路，很多要经过高山峻岭，工程相当艰巨。如商漫公路要通过两个海拔一千三百公尺高的山，在山上要修盘道汽车才能通过。公路通车以后，不仅山区的毛皮，药材，木耳，水果等土特产可以顺利运出来，山区人民需要的食盐，布匹，日用百货等，也可以及时运进去。
