Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th: Xu Naiguang, a specialist from the Chiang Kai-shek group's Taiwan "Central Mint," returned to Guangzhou a few days ago and was warmly received by relevant departments of the Guangzhou Municipal People's Committee.

Xu Naiguang worked in the banking and railway departments under the Kuomintang rule for more than forty years and is now sixty-five years old. He told reporters that the Chiang Kai-shek group has very strict control over entry and exit from Taiwan. Public officials cannot leave Taiwan unless they retire after the age of sixty. Moreover, those who are allowed to leave Taiwan must first have their families definitely not in Taiwan.

He told reporters that after the spring warms up, he will go to Beijing and Wuhan to visit his children and personally see the new face of the motherland.

    台湾“中央造币厂”专员徐乃光回到广州
    据新华社广州12日电　蒋介石集团台湾“中央造币厂”专员徐乃光前几天回到广州，受到广州市人民委员会有关部门的热情接待。
    徐乃光在国民党统治下的银行和铁道部门工作了四十多年，今年已经六十五岁了。他跟记者说：蒋介石集团对台湾的出入境控制很严，公务人员除非到满六十岁退休后不能离开台湾；而且能获准离开台湾的人，首先要本人的家眷确实是不在台湾的。
    他告诉记者，春暖以后，他就要去北京和武汉探望儿女，并且亲自看看祖国的新面貌。
