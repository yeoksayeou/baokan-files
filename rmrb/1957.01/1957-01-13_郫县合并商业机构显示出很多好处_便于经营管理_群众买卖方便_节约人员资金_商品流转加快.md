    Pixian County's Merger of Commercial Institutions Shows Many Benefits
    Facilitates Business Management, Convenient for People's Buying and Selling, Saves Personnel and Funds, Accelerates Commodity Circulation
    (This report is from the Sichuan Daily) Sichuan Pixian County's trial implementation of merging the original ten commercial institutions into three has not only facilitated business management but also made it convenient for the people to buy and sell. At the same time, it has saved a large amount of personnel and funds and accelerated the speed of commodity circulation.
    The county's work on merging commercial institutions began in July of last year. They merged the Textile Company into the Department Store; merged the Food, Trade, Salt, and Catering Companies into the Supply and Marketing Cooperative; and merged the Grain Company, Oil Company, and Agricultural Commodity Procurement Bureau into the Agricultural Products Company. The original retail outlets of each institution in the townships have not been adjusted for the time being, but some comprehensive retail outlets adapted to the new institutions have been set up on a trial basis in the county seat.
    The benefits of merging commercial institutions have gradually become apparent. After the heads of the original units gathered together, it facilitated not only the utilization of their expertise but also collective leadership and division of labor. At the same time, because business cadres and internal management personnel engaged in the same commodities could be reduced by more than 36% (transferred to replenish grassroots units), a large amount of manpower was saved. In addition, the new institutions saved many unnecessary procedures for wholesale, calculation, counting, and storage, which improved work efficiency, and the originally planned plans, contracts, agreements, and orders were all well executed.
    A large amount of funds has also been saved after the merger of institutions. In the past, the Department Store and Textile Companies needed a total of 1.08 million yuan in loans each month. After the merger, only one set of inventory is needed, and a monthly loan of 570,000 yuan is sufficient. In the first half of last year, the original Department Store was fined more than 1,400 yuan due to slow capital turnover, while the Textile Company had more than 40,000 yuan of surplus funds at that time due to fast capital turnover. After the merger of the two companies, unified and rational use of funds not only reduced loans and avoided fines but also resulted in an overall surplus of funds. The administrative management costs of each unit have also been greatly reduced, with savings of several thousand yuan per month from reducing cadres alone.
    After the merger of commercial institutions, the speed of commodity circulation has been greatly accelerated, costs have been reduced, and the time for commodities to meet buyers has been shortened, which has satisfied customers.

### 郫县合并商业机构显示出很多好处  便于经营管理　群众买卖方便　节约人员资金　商品流转加快

    郫县合并商业机构显示出很多好处
    便于经营管理　群众买卖方便　节约人员资金　商品流转加快
    本报讯　据四川日报报道：四川郫县试行将原先的十个商业机构合并成了三个，既便于经营管理，又便于群众买卖，同时，节约了大量人员和资金，加快了商品流转速度。
    这个县合并商业机构的工作，是在去年7月份开始的。他们把纺织品公司并入百货公司；把食品、贸易、盐业、饮食等四个公司并入供销合作社；粮食公司、油脂公司、农商品采购局合并成农产品公司。原有各机构在乡镇的门市部暂时没有调整，只是在县城试办了一些适应新机构的综合门市部。
    商业机构合并的好处已经逐渐显示出来了。原来各单位的负责人会合在一起以后，既便于发挥他们的专长，又便于集体领导和分工负责。同时，由于经营同样商品的业务干部和内部管理人员可以减少36％以上（调去充实基层单位），也就节约了大量的人力。加以新的机构节省了许多不必要的批发、计算、清点、保管等手续，工作效率提高了，原订的计划、合同、协议、订单等都执行得很好。
    合并机构后还节约了大量的资金。过去，百货和纺织品两个公司每月共需贷款一百零八万元，合并后只需一套库存，每月贷款五十七万元就够了。去年上半年原百货公司因资金周转慢，曾被罚款一千四百多元；而纺织品公司当时却因为资金周转得快，多余了四万多元的资金。两个公司合并以后，统一合理使用资金，不但减少了贷款和不受罚款，而且资金总有长余。各单位的行政管理费用也大大降低，仅减少干部一项，每月就节省了好几千元。
    商业机构合并以后，大大加快了商品流转速度，降低了成本，缩短了商品同购买者见面的时间，顾客都很满意。
