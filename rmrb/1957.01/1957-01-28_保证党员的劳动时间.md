Guaranteeing Party Members' Labor Time
Zhang Shihong

The phenomenon of rural Party members losing working hours due to official duties is still very common. This phenomenon leads to two consequences: first, Party members become detached from the masses; second, Party members' personal lives are not guaranteed.

An investigation in five townships, including Sanshi in Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, revealed that Party members in these townships worked an average of only 64 workdays last year. Excessive loss of working hours has caused dissatisfaction among the masses. Firstly, the community needs to issue subsidized work points for official absences, and if Party members rely too much on subsidies, the masses will see this as "gaining without labor." Secondly, the masses often evaluate a Party member primarily based on their attitude towards labor, and whether they take the lead in labor and integrate with the masses. When the masses are working hard, Party members are often not present, and despite various reasons, the masses are still dissatisfied. In Shizhuozi Township, Weichang County, Hebei Province, there was a Party member named Zhang Yaozong, who had always been recognized by the masses as a good Party member, enduring hardship before enjoying comfort, and always caring for the masses. However, due to excessive work and meetings, his production was affected, and he only earned over sixty work points last year, less than half of the average. The masses criticized him, saying that he was not as good at labor as his elderly mother. Can we say that the masses' perspective is "one-sided"? No. We often teach the masses to love labor, so what reason do we have to allow Party members to lag behind in labor? We often say that we must closely connect with the masses, so how can we talk about genuine connection if we don't go to labor and share joys and hardships with them? Therefore, the criticism from the masses should make us realize one point: regardless of the reason, if Party members lag behind in labor, it will detach our Party from the masses and create more obstacles for our various tasks.

Secondly, if Party members' labor time is not guaranteed, their lives will also not be guaranteed. Although subsidies can be obtained for official absences, these subsidies are limited, and some cannot even maintain the minimum standard of living. According to investigations in four townships, including Dongyuan in Pingjiang County, the proportion of Party members who cannot maintain their livelihoods accounts for 34% of all Party members. This must be considered a serious phenomenon.

Where does the crux of the problem lie? Some say that some Party members have developed a fondness for ease and aversion to work. Indeed, this is true, and we must strengthen education for these Party members. But it should be pointed out that these Party members are, after all, a very small minority. The vast majority of our rural Party members were originally skilled in production. They have a habit of loving labor, and they understand that personal and collective happiness can only be obtained through hard work. But what can they do? Many meetings and tasks are pressing down on them, making it hard for them to breathe. In May last year, Zhang Ganlin, a Party member of the Daping Cooperative in Pingjiang County, attended meetings in the district five times, spending twelve days traveling back and forth; attended meetings in the township four times, occupying four days; attended meetings within the cooperative three times, occupying two days; spent four days helping the cooperative formulate the annual rural sideline production plan; and spent one day conducting a comprehensive production inspection, totaling twenty-three days. In addition to going to the county to sign contracts and buying goods for the cooperative, he didn't work at all for a whole month. This situation has not changed much after the merging of districts and townships.

The central issue now is to require Party organizations at all levels to thoroughly change their leadership style, streamlining meetings level by level from top to bottom, and going down to solve problems in person more often, in order to reduce the workload of non-detached Party members and ensure that they can spend most of their time engaged in production. The Pingjiang County Committee recently took some measures, in addition to strengthening labor education for Party members, stipulated the number of various Party meetings to be held, greatly reduced the concurrent positions of Party members, and determined the number of labor days that Party members should work each year. This approach is good and worth referring to in other places.

We should understand that leading production is the regular and central task of rural Party organizations, and all work should be to ensure production and improve production, and should never conflict with production. Giving Party members sufficient labor time is not only beneficial to Party members and production, but also beneficial to the Party's work. Because the relationship established between Party members and millions of farmers in common labor is a flesh-and-blood relationship, and this relationship is the premise for us to do all our work well.

    保证党员的劳动时间
    章世鸿
    现在一部分农村党员因公误工的现象还很普遍。这种现象引起两种后果：一是党员脱离群众；二是党员的个人生活没有保障。
    湖南平江县在三市等五个乡作了调查，发现这些乡的党员去年每人平均只做了六十四个工。误工过多，引起了群众的不满。一来因公误工社内需要发补助工分，党员如果过多地依靠补助，群众就认为这是“不劳而获”；二来群众评价一个党员往往首先看他的劳动态度，看他是否在劳动中带头，和群众打成一片。当群众正在辛勤劳动时，党员常常不在场，尽管有各种原因，群众还是不满意的。河北围场县石桌子乡有个党员叫张耀宗，一向被群众公认是好党员，吃苦在先，享乐在后，处处关心群众。可是由于过多的工作和会议，影响他的生产，去年挣得工分只有六十几个，比一般群众少一半以上。群众批评他，说他劳动上还不如他的老母亲。能不能说群众看人看事“片面”呢？不能。我们经常教导群众要热爱劳动，有什么理由允许党员在劳动中反而落后呢？我们经常说要紧密地联系群众，那么，不到劳动中去和他们同甘共苦，又怎样谈得上真正的联系呢？因此，群众的批评应当使我们认清一点：不管由于什么原因，如果党员在劳动中落后，那就会使我们的党脱离群众，也会使我们的各项工作遇到更多阻力。
    其次，党员的劳动时间没有保障，他们的生活也会没有保障。虽然因公误工可以得到补助，但这种补助是有限的，有的甚至不能维持最低的生活。据平江县东沅等四个乡调查，不能维持生活的党员竟占全体党员的34％。这不能不说是严重现象。
    问题的症结在哪里呢？有人说，有些党员滋长了好逸恶劳思想，的确，这是事实，对这些党员要加强教育，但应该指明，这种党员毕竟是极少数。我们绝大部分农村党员原先都是生产中的能手，他们有爱好劳动的习惯，他们懂得个人和集体的幸福只有依靠辛勤的劳动去得到的。可是又有什么办法呢？许多会议、工作压在他们头上，使他们喘不过气来。平江县大坪合作社党员张甘林，去年5月一个月中，到区上开会五次，来回花十二天；到乡上开会四次，占四天；社内开会三次，占两天；帮助社内订全年农村副业生产计划搞了四天；全面检查生产一天，共花去二十三天，加上到县里去订合同，替社内买物品，结果整整一个月没有出工。这种情况在撤区并乡后，仍然改变不大。
    当前的中心问题就是要求各级党组织彻底改变领导方式，自上而下的逐级精简会议，多亲自下去解决问题，以减少不脱产的党员的工作负担，保证他们能用大部分时间去从事生产。平江县委会最近采取了一些措施，除加强对党员的劳动教育外，对党内各种会议的召开次数都作了规定，大大减少党员的兼职，并且给党员确定每年应做劳动日的数目。这种做法是好的，值得别的地方参考。
    我们应该明白，领导生产是农村党的经常性的中心任务，一切工作都应该为了保证生产、提高生产，决不应该同生产矛盾。给党员充分劳动时间，不但对党员有利，对生产有利，对党的工作也有利。因为党员和千百万农民群众在共同劳动中建立起来的关系才是血肉的关系，这种关系是我们做好一切工作的前提。
