    Premier Zhou in West Pakistan
    By Our Correspondent Hu Qi
    In the past four days, Premier Zhou Enlai and his entourage toured northern West Pakistan and visited Peshawar and Lahore, two famous cities with a history of more than two thousand years. These two cities, considered more conservative than Karachi, have developed from British military bases into modern cities in a short period. Premier Zhou Enlai and his entourage received the warmest welcome in both cities.
    Peshawar is famous as the second center of ancient Buddhism. At that time, Buddhism had just begun to spread to China and Central Asia. Premier Zhou visited the Peshawar Museum, where many treasured Buddhist scriptures are on display. These scriptures and other excavated relics are specimens of the rich Buddhist culture of 1,500 to 2,000 years ago. The museum's collection of Buddha statues, stone carvings about religious life, manuscripts on religion and science, porcelain, and coins from various dynasties serve as rich and valuable records of ancient culture.
    The Chinese are no strangers to the residents of this city. Whenever Premier Zhou and his entourage met with local people, the long-standing cultural relationship between China and Pakistan always became the best topic. The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Peshawar (located on the site of a famous Buddhist monastery 1,500 years ago) pointed out in his welcoming speech to Premier Zhou: In the Islamic scriptures, the Prophet taught people that even if you have to go to China, you should study. On the other hand, the deeds of the ancient Chinese monk Xuanzang are deeply engraved in the hearts of the people here. People often mention Xuanzang and Faxian's journeys to South Asia and West Asia to seek knowledge. Xuanzang's travelogue has become one of the precious documents of ancient history.
    Few women are seen on the streets of Peshawar. The limited few who are seen are also wrapped tightly from head to toe in large pieces of cloth. It is said that this is because the Islamic scriptures say that the virtue of women is to stay at home and not show their faces in public places. Only grandmothers can go out on the street without a veil. Considering this tradition, the welcome of the people in this area to Premier Zhou and his entourage is even more touching. In Mardan, women joyfully participated in the welcoming procession.
    The tribes gave Premier Zhou the most colorful welcome. In the town of Hoti, the narrow and winding streets were filled with countless red and green flags, and in a very short distance, there were more than a dozen decorated archways with various beautiful felt carpets and curtains woven by the local people. At a welcome meeting attended by more than 200 elders of the Bakhtun tribe, the tribal chief of Hoti presented Premier Zhou with a turban. This is the most solemn ceremony of this tribe, signifying the recognition of a foreigner as a brother member of their tribe. This is the first time in four hundred years that a foreigner has received this highest honor. Premier Zhou expressed his gratitude and said: "He hopes that the people of the world will become brothers."
    Lahore is also an ancient city. It is so old that the exact year of its establishment cannot be found. Lahore is famous for its castles and ancient buildings. Although it is as old as Peshawar, in a sense, it has more freedom. The social restrictions on women are not so strict, and women can be seen walking on the streets, although some of them are still wearing veils. People told me that these are mainly middle-class women.
    Lahore, the capital of West Pakistan and the second largest city, has a population of more than 800,000. Premier Zhou and his entourage received the warmest welcome here. From the airport to the Governor's House, a distance of six miles, from the Governor's House to the Lahore Royal Fort, a distance of five miles, and wherever Premier Zhou went, the sidewalks were paved with red sand, hung with red and green Chinese and Pakistani national flags, and many archways decorated with red cloth were erected, with welcome slogans written in Chinese, Urdu, and English. One of the archways was painted in the shape of Tiananmen Square, with two hands, each wearing the Chinese and Pakistani national flags, tightly clasped together, and below it was written: "May China and Pakistan be forever united!"
    On the eve of Premier Zhou's departure from Lahore, the local people held a spectacular fireworks display to bid farewell to the guests. About 30,000 people gathered in Jinnah Garden, including many women. When Premier Zhou was led through the crowd, cheers erupted immediately, lasting for several minutes. A duty police officer wanted to talk to me in broken English, and I had difficulty understanding the meaning of his words. But he tried his best to find some English words to express his feelings for the Chinese people: "I love Chini (Chinese people), very, very."
    Now, Premier Zhou and his party have completed their visit to West Pakistan. The enthusiasm and friendship of the people there for the Chinese people are deeply left in the hearts of the Chinese visitors and conveyed to the Chinese people through them. I was instructed to bring back two letters. One was written by Lal Shah, acting director of the Peshawar District Cooperative. On behalf of the farmers in the district, he expressed the wish that Chinese farmers "succeed in their efforts to achieve their great goals." The other was written by Or Anwar, a vice chairman of a Pakistani trade union. He said: Although some people do not want to see the strengthening of friendship between China and Pakistan, all Pakistani people sincerely hope that the two countries, especially the workers of the two countries, will maintain increasingly close relations. He also said: Pakistani workers are very happy to receive Premier Zhou. They believe that Premier Zhou's visit is beneficial not only to the two countries but also to the entire East and the peace of the world.

### 周总理在西巴基斯坦

    周总理在西巴基斯坦
    本报记者　胡骑
    过去四天，周恩来总理和随行人员游览了西巴基斯坦北部，访问了具有两千年以上悠久历史的两个名城白沙瓦和拉合尔。这两个被认为比卡拉奇更有保守色彩的城市，在短短的时期中已从英国的军事基地发展成为现代城市。周恩来总理和随行人员在两个城市里受到最热烈的欢迎。
    白沙瓦是以古代佛教的第二个中心而著名的。那个时候，佛教刚开始传入中国和中亚细亚。周总理曾参观白沙瓦博物馆，在那里展览着珍藏的许多佛经。这些佛经和其他发掘出来的遗物，是一千五百年到两千年前佛教丰富文化的标本。这博物馆所收藏的佛像和关于宗教生活的石雕、宗教和科学方面的抄本、瓷器和各个朝代的钱币等，成为古代文化丰富的和宝贵的纪录。
    中国人对于这个城市的居民并不是陌生的。每当周总理和随行人员同当地的人士见面的时候，中巴两国历史悠久的文化关系总是成为最好的话题。白沙瓦大学（它的所在地是一千五百年前一个著名的佛教寺院）副校长在欢迎周总理的欢迎词中指出：在回教的圣经中，先知教导人们，即使要到中国去你也要学习。另一方面，中国古代的法师玄奘的事迹，深深铭记在这里人民的心中。人们经常提到玄奘和法显到过南亚和西亚寻求学问的事情。玄奘的旅行记曾经成为古代历史的宝贵文献之一。
    白沙瓦的街上，很少看见妇女来往。偶尔看到的有限几个也是从头到脚用大块布帛包得密密的。据说，这是因为回教圣经里说，妇女的美德就是守在家里而不在公共场所抛头露面。只有作了祖母的女人可以不戴面纱上街。考虑到这种传统，这个地区的人民对周总理和随行人员的欢迎就更加使人感动了。在马丹，妇女兴高采烈地参加了欢迎的行列。
    各部族给予周总理以最丰富多采的欢迎。在霍蒂镇，窄小而弯曲的街道上挂满了无数红绿的旗子，在很短的距离中间有着十多个用当地人民手织的各种美丽的毡毯和幕帷装饰的牌坊。在一个有两百多位巴克同族的长者参加的欢迎会上，霍蒂镇的部落首领赠给周总理一块头巾。这是这个部落一种最隆重的仪式，表示承认一个外国人成为他们族中的兄弟成员。四百年来一个外国人得到这种最高荣誉的，这还是首次。周总理表示感谢说：“他希望全世界的人民都成为兄弟。”
    拉合尔也是一个古城。它是这样的古老，已经找不出这个城市建立的确实年月了。拉合尔是以它的城堡和古代建筑物而著名的。它虽然和白沙瓦同样的古老，可是在某种意义上说，这里的自由色彩却比较多一些。社会上对于妇女的束缚并不那样严厉，在街上可以看到妇女们在走动，虽然她们中间的一部分仍然是戴着面纱的。人们告诉我说，这些主要是中间阶层的妇女。
    拉合尔这个西巴基斯坦的首府和第二个大城市有八十多万人口。周总理和随行人员在这里受到最热情的欢迎。从飞机场到省长府六英里长的路上，从省长府到拉合尔皇堡的五英里长的路上，以及周总理所到的地方，人行道上都铺着红砂，挂着红红绿绿的中巴两国国旗，还搭起了许许多多饰以红布的牌坊，上面用中文、乌尔都文和英文写着欢迎的标语。其中一个牌坊，油漆成天安门的形状，两边两只各佩着中巴两国国旗的手紧握在一起，下面写着：“愿中巴两国永远连在一起！”
    在周总理离开拉合尔的前夕，当地人民举行了精采的焰火表演来欢送客人。大约有三万人聚集在真纳花园，其中有许多妇女。当周总理被引导经过人群的时候，立即爆发出欢呼声，历时几分钟之久。一个值勤的警察用不熟练的英语要和我说话，我很难明白他的话的意义。但是他想尽办法找到一些英文字来表达他对中国人民的感情：“我爱秦尼（中国人），非常，非常。”
    现在，周总理一行人已经完成了在西巴基斯坦的访问。那里的人们对中国人民的热情和友谊深深留在中国访问者的心里，并且通过他们传达给中国人民。我被嘱托带回两封信。一封是白沙瓦区合作社代理干事拉尔·沙写的。他以该区农民们的名义表示愿望中国农民“在为实现他们伟大目标而进行的努力中获得成功”。另一封是一位巴基斯坦工会副主席奥尔·安瓦尔所写的。他说：虽然有些人不愿看到中巴两国友谊的加强，但所有巴基斯坦人民都衷心希望两国，特别是两国工人之间保持日益密切的关系。他还说：巴基斯坦工人十分高兴接待周总理。他们认为周总理这次访问不仅对于两国而且对于整个东方以及全世界的和平都是有好处的。
