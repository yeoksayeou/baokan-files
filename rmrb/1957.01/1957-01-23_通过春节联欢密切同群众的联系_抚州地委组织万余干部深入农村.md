Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, January 22nd: The Fuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangxi Province will organize over ten thousand cadres during the Spring Festival to go deep into the countryside and celebrate the festival with the peasants.

According to the results of recent investigations in the villages by the Secretary and members of the Fuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the rectification movement centered on running the cooperatives democratically in the Fuzhou Special District has achieved great results. This has strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses and greatly promoted the development of agricultural and sideline production this winter. However, the democratic management movement has not been carried out extensively and deeply enough in some areas. Some cooperatives have only made general publicity arrangements and have not truly taken action. Therefore, the opinions of the members have not been reflected, and the relationship between cadres and the masses is not harmonious enough. The autumn harvest settlement and distribution work in some cooperatives has not been done well, the distribution between teams is unreasonable, and the members have some opinions. At the same time, some areas one-sidedly emphasize national and collective interests and ignore the individual interests of the masses. But there are also some farmers who are divorced from reality and have excessive and urgent demands for improving their lives.

In order to further strengthen the relationship between the cooperative and the members, between the cadres and the masses, and to guide the peasants to correctly understand the superiority of agricultural cooperation, and to make the peasants understand that the improvement of life must be built on the basis of production development, the Fuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to organize more than 10,000 cadres at all levels in the district during the Spring Festival, led by 15 leading cadres, including the Secretary and members of the Prefectural Committee and Commissioners, to go deep into the countryside for a week to give reports to the peasants, hold joint celebrations and discussions with the peasants, and visit the homes of the members. During the visits, 110,000 yuan in relief funds will also be distributed to some members with difficult living conditions to help them solve their financial difficulties during the New Year. The supply and marketing cooperative department of the special district will take out more than 50,000 yuan to purchase various agricultural and sideline products before the Spring Festival. The Prefectural Committee also requires all agricultural cooperatives to distribute the remaining grain within the cooperative to the members in difficulty in the next few days, so that all members have grain and money for the New Year. Relevant supply agencies are also taking measures to appropriately meet the needs of farmers for major non-staple foods such as pork and cooking oil during the Spring Festival, and increase supply stations and simplify supply procedures to facilitate farmers' purchases.

    通过春节联欢密切同群众的联系
    抚州地委组织万余干部深入农村
    新华社南昌22日电　中共江西省抚州地委在春节期间，将组织一万多名干部深入农村，同农民一起欢度春节。
    根据中共抚州地委书记、委员最近下乡调查的结果，抚州专区以民主办社为中心的整社运动获得了很大成绩，密切了干部同群众的关系，大大推动了今年冬季农、副业生产的发展。但是，部分地区的民主办社运动开展得还不广泛、深入，有的社只作了一般的宣传布置，没有真正行动起来，因而社员的意见还没有反映出来，干部同群众的关系还不够融洽。部分社的秋收结算分配工作做得不好，队与队之间的分配不合理，社员有些意见。同时，部分地区片面强调国家利益和集体利益，忽视了群众的个人利益。但也有一些农民脱离实际，对生活改善要求过高过急。
    为了进一步密切社和社员、干部和群众的关系，引导农民正确认识农业合作化的优越性，使农民懂得生活改善必须建筑在生产发展基础上的道理，中共抚州地委决定在春节期间组织全区各级干部一万多人，由地委书记、委员、专员等十五个领导干部率领，分别以一周的时间深入农村，向农民作报告，同农民联欢、座谈，并到社员家里访问。在访问中还要将十一万元救济金发给部分生活困难的社员，帮助他们解决过年的经济困难。专区供销合作部门将拿出五万多元在春节前收购各种农、副业产品。地委还要求所有农业社在最近几天内把社内剩余的分配粮分配给困难的社员。使全体社员过年时有粮有钱。有关供应机关还正在采取措施适当满足农民在春节期间对猪肉、食油等主要副食品的需要，并增加供应站，简化供应手续，方便农民购买。
