A Year Later: Revisiting the Socialist Upsurge
Xinhua News Agency Shanghai Correspondent Team Reporting

Last year at this time, during the upsurge of socialist transformation in Shanghai, we witnessed countless inspiring scenes and met many unforgettable individuals. With those memories from a year ago, we recently conducted another extensive series of interviews.

	Elected as Deputy Mayor

At the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress meeting on January 9th, Rong Yiren was elected as Deputy Mayor. He and the other ten elected Deputy Mayors stood before the podium, expressing their gratitude to the representatives for the trust placed in them. His wife, Yang Jianqing, who was elected as a municipal People's Representative for the first time, also applauded the newly appointed mayors in the hall.

Yang Jianqing shared with reporters what her children had said about this event.

"Today, I was silent in class. The teacher was surprised, wondering why I was so well-behaved today?...Dad was elected Deputy Mayor, so I can't be naughty anymore." This was said by her son, who used to talk and fidget in class. Her eldest daughter, a freshman in college, quietly told her mother that she should be even more frugal and simple in the future. Her youngest daughter, a first-grader, said, "Mom, I got a five on my math test today. I must be a good student who gets all fives in the future."

A year ago, reporters visited this excited and busy family. This year, the situation has only intensified. Over the past year, Rong Yiren and his wife have received a constant stream of writers, actors, filmmakers, and many foreign guests. Rong Yiren has traveled both domestically and internationally on numerous occasions for his social activities. When asked about the state of his enterprises, he said: "All the Shenxin factories exceeded their planned targets last year. A textile factory recently built in Anhui with our investment has already put four thousand spindles into operation."

When asked about his plans after being elected as Deputy Mayor, he said, "As a public servant of the people, I will use this standard to measure myself in the future, and I will do my best to fulfill my responsibilities in promoting the thorough completion of the socialist transformation of industry and commerce."

	Still Busy: The Federation of Industry and Commerce

Walking through the arched doorway of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, along the corridor that a year ago was filled with the sounds of gongs, drums, and firecrackers, and up the office building, the scene is still just as busy and active. On the day the reporters visited, meetings were being held in the conference rooms and offices throughout the morning and afternoon. In the office of the First Light Industry Committee, more than ten industrialists and businessmen had just finished discussing the summary of the first year of public-private partnership, and then others sat down to discuss the participation of industrialists and businessmen in socialist competitions and the livelihood issues of small business owners. In another room, some industrialists and businessmen were chatting about their thoughts on the fixed interest period.

Zhang Hongyuan, the office director, introduced that the most important task of the Federation of Industry and Commerce at present is to organize study sessions for industrialists and businessmen. Last year, nearly nine thousand industrialists and businessmen in the city participated in spare-time political universities and political schools for industry and commerce. More than 110,000 people from industry and commerce signed up to attend current affairs and policy lectures, which are held every half month. Recently, the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce has also established a spare-time supplementary school for industry and commerce. Commercial accounting classes have already started, which is to enable some industrialists and businessmen without technical expertise to acquire a skill and gradually become self-reliant working citizens.

	One Large Store Every Ten Days

Last January, reporters saw a blueprint in the First Commercial Bureau to transform Nanjing Road into an even more prosperous commercial center. A year later, the area has been completely renewed. Small, poorly performing shops are gone, and newly opened, large, modern stores are packed with customers. Pengjie Advanced Women's Clothing Store, originally located in the corridor of a building, has become a large fashion store on Nanjing Road. The famous Shanghai Accountancy Company, which used to have only half a storefront, has moved into the building. Sanyang Dried Goods Store, Nanyang Knitwear Company, Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors Store... almost all the famous stores have expanded their storefronts. In addition, the city's largest fur store, jewelry store, yarn store, embroidery store, halal food store, radio store, and more, which did not exist in the past, have also opened here. Over the past year, an average of one large store has appeared every ten days in the section from Xizang Middle Road to the Bund, a distance of just over one kilometer.

	Regulars at the Workers' Cultural Palace

In the crowded halls of the Workers' Cultural Palace, a group of visitors wearing badges of "Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Political School" and holding notebooks are carefully examining the pictures of the Shanghai Workers' Movement historical materials.

An elderly gentleman, nearly seventy years old, stood in front of the portrait of Wang Xiaohua, a martyr who died heroically, and solemnly put on his old glasses. The reporter heard him say to his companion: "Without the blood and sacrifice of the martyrs, how would we know about socialism?"

A year ago, the Workers' Cultural Palace warmly received the first group of people from industry and commerce, who were called the new guests of the Workers' Cultural Palace. The person in charge of the Cultural Palace told reporters that in the past year, an average of more than two hundred private-sector personnel from joint ventures have come here every day to visit and study with union members. Industrialists and businessmen have become regular guests at the Workers' Cultural Palace.

	Third Visit to the People Who Are Now Masters of Their Own Destiny

Opening the interview notebook from this time last year, the reporter found the name of a worker: Zhou Xiaoxing of Yuxing Cotton Weaving Factory. The reporter immediately recalled his eagerness to speak at the Shanghai Workers' Representative Conference, which mobilized 1.3 million workers to join the transformation upsurge.

When the reporter went to the Yuxing Factory to find him, people at the factory said that Zhou Xiaoxing had already been appointed by the government as the public representative of the Fuqiang Weaving Factory.

It was heard that the Fuqiang Factory's public representative's experience in uniting with the private sector to run the enterprise well had been introduced in the district and professional companies.

It was also heard that one morning last summer, the employees of Fuqiang Factory suddenly found that the canteen, which had always been located next to the toilet and stank, had been moved to a clean empty room. It turned out that the public representative had taken a factory Sunday and worked with several workers to solve this long-standing problem of employee dissatisfaction without spending a penny. Unexpectedly, this public representative was Zhou Xiaoxing.

When the reporter arrived at the Fuqiang Factory, the public representative who came out to meet them was another newly promoted worker from the factory. He said that Zhou Xiaoxing is now the secretary of the joint party branch of several factories and is studying work in another factory.

It was not until the third visit that the reporter finally found this new figure who had been tempered in the socialist transformation movement, Zhou Xiaoxing. He humbly said: "I have no experience, but I just lead by example and rely on the masses!"

	Opening the Doors for a Year

Ding Jide, the manager of Xinfeng Iron Factory, who personally opened the long-closed doors a year ago to welcome public-private partnership, told reporters with a smile: "After opening the doors for a year, the enterprise has made a profit of 60,000 yuan."

Before the joint venture, Xinfeng Factory lost money every year. Ding Jide mistakenly blamed the bad feng shui of the door, so he kept it tightly closed and only used the side door. But the debts continued to pile up, and liabilities exceeded assets by more than double.

In every workshop, there are tools for repairing cars and electrical appliances piled up everywhere. Ding Jide said, "In the past, I just pulled in orders randomly, regardless of whether the factory could do it or not. I wanted everything, and as a result, I couldn't do it, and late penalties were commonplace." After the joint venture, the production is arranged by professional companies, specializing in manufacturing these tools. After the nature of the enterprise changed, the workers' enthusiasm for production was very high. Last year, the total output value increased by more than 80% compared with the previous year. Ding Jide also received more than 400 yuan in fixed interest last year. He said: "Opening the door and heading towards socialism is the right path."

	A Peddler Becomes a Manager

In the new year, the reporter met Zhang Aiguo, the newly appointed private deputy manager of the state-owned Shanghai Vegetable Company. Zhang Aiguo is not a capitalist millionaire, but just a peddler with a small capital of dozens of yuan in the small vegetable market. A year ago, he was publicly elected as the representative of more than 100,000 peddlers at the city's peddlers' conference and applied to the People's Government for public-private partnership.

Zhang Aiguo is only thirty-two years old this year, but he has been a peddler for twenty years. In the old society, he also worked as an assistant to a rickshaw puller and a handyman in a hospital, living a semi-unemployed life.

Coincidentally, that day was the two-month anniversary of his appointment as deputy manager of the state-owned company. He told reporters that after taking on the new position, he had a wish: to make the state-owned company and the peddler masses as united as a family. Based on this wish, he proposed five suggestions to the public manager, including holding regular forums for peddlers. These five suggestions have now been adopted and implemented.

	Poetic Inspiration of the 63-Year-Old Man

Mr. Ding Fangzhen, the manager of Shanghai's famous Baodaxiang Cotton Fabric Store, who had put down his pen for many years, was inspired to write a volume of poems called "Yesterday Was Wrong, Today Is Right" during the city's transformation upsurge last year. The enthusiastic verses were widely circulated for a time.

Mr. Ding is now the chairman of the joint board of directors of Shanghai's public-private joint venture silk and cloth stores. It is said that he writes lightly and vigorously and continues to write poetry. Recently, the reporter visited Mr. Ding in the chairman's office and asked him what achievements he had made in the poetry world over the past year. Mr. Ding said: "Work, study, and life have been very pleasant over the past year. In my spare time, I enjoy writing poetry. I write about one poem every day, and at most three poems. So far, I have written five hundred poems." The reporter was amazed by the old gentleman's lofty aspirations.

The old gentleman said that he is sixty-three years old this year, and his learning ability is relatively slow, but he still embraces the spirit of "Xu Ce running around the city", striving to catch up and "knowing the difficulties and advancing". He told reporters that in addition to studying at the board of directors and the Municipal Political Consultative Conference, he also studies philosophy at the spare-time political university. Recently, he has completed the course on dialectical materialism and wrote sixty ancient poems when writing his study experience.

	After Stepping Down from the Stage

Shen Fangcheng, the wife of Hu Juewen, the vice chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, recently received a letter from her friend Xu Jingshu. A year ago, they successfully performed a living newspaper play called "The Transformation of Sister Wang", which was self-written and self-directed based on real people and events, at the grand gala celebrating the victory of socialist transformation in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles. Xu Jingshu and her husband Liu Gongcheng, who played the Wang Da Jie couple on stage, have moved to Beijing with their whole family. Liu Gongcheng has taken on a new position in the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, where he can better use his expertise in the cement industry. Xu Jingshu happily told Shen Fangcheng that she herself will soon be starting a job.

Shen Fangcheng, who is sixty-two years old, is just like the character she played in the living newspaper play, an active member of the industrial and commercial family members. Not long ago, she was elected as a Shanghai Municipal People's Representative again. After completing the first phase of study at the industrial and commercial political school, she entered the spare-time political university organized by the CPPCC. In this school, she and her old partner Hu Juewen are classmates, but she is studying political economy, while he is studying philosophy.

Another noteworthy character in the living newspaper play, the studious maid, was played by Hu Qinzhen, the wife of Sun Zhaoming, the manager of the Xie Da Xiang Cotton Fabric Store, which was a public-private joint venture at the time. This forty-five-year-old housewife, who originally had only elementary school education, is now a first-year high school student in a supplementary school. These days, she is busily preparing for the end-of-term exams.

    高潮一年访旧
    新华社驻上海记者集体采写
    去年这时，我们在上海社会主义改造的高潮中，看到过无数激动人心的场面，遇见过许多难以忘却的人物。我们带着一年前的回忆，最近作了又一次广泛的访问。
      当选了副市长
    在1月9日上海市人民代表大会会议上，荣毅仁当选了副市长，他和其他十位当选的副市长站在主席台前，神情激动地感谢代表们所给予的信任。第一次被选为市人民代表的他的夫人杨鉴清，也在会场上为新任的市长们鼓掌。
    杨鉴清把孩子们为这件事对她讲的话，告诉了记者。
    “今天我在课堂上一声也不响，老师觉得奇怪，怎么我今天特别守规矩？……爸爸当选副市长，以后我再也不好顽皮了。”这是原来上课爱说话做小动作的儿子说的。已经是大学一年级生的大女儿，悄悄地对妈妈说，以后她更应该勤俭朴素。小学一年级生的小女儿说：“妈妈，我今天算术考了五分，以后一定要做都是五分的好学生。”
    一年前记者访问过这个兴奋、忙碌的家庭。今年这种情景有增无已。一年来，荣毅仁和他的夫人接待了接踵而来的作家、演员、电影摄影师和许多外国客人。荣毅仁曾经多次奔波国内国外从事他的社会活动。记者问到他所从事的企业情况如何？他说：申新各厂去年都超额完成了计划。在安徽参加投资新建的一个纺织厂，最近已经有四千纱锭开动了。
    在谈到当选副市长以后的打算，他说：“作为人民的公务员，我以后要用这个标准来衡量自己，在推动工商界彻底完成社会主义改造的工作中，尽到应尽的责任。”	依然忙碌的工商联
    走进上海市工商业联合会的圆拱门，沿着一年前曾经成天轰鸣着锣鼓和爆竹声的通道，跨上办公大楼，这里所见到的景象依然是那样忙碌和活跃。记者前去访问那天，这里的会议室、办公室，上下午都举行着会议。第一轻工业委员会的办公室里，十多个工商业者刚在一起讨论了合营第一年公私共事关系的总结，接着又有人坐下来讨论关于工商业者参加社会主义竞赛和小业主的生活问题。在另外一间，还有一些工商业者正在漫谈他们对定息期限的感想。
    办公室主任张宏远介绍说：工商联目前最重要的一项工作是组织工商业者学习。去年一年，全市近九千名工商业者参加业余政治大学和工商界政治学校学习，工商界报名参加听时事政策讲座的共十一万多人，这种讲座每半月举行一次。最近，市工商联又举办了工商界业余补习学校，商业会计班已经开课，这是为了使一部分没有技术专长的工商业者有一技之长，逐渐成为能够自食其力的劳动公民。
      十天一家大商店
    去年1月份，记者曾在第一商业局看到一张改造南京路成为更加繁荣的商业中心的蓝图。一年以后的今天，这里已经是气象一新。规模狭小、营业清淡的商店没有了，新开的巨大的新型商店，家家顾客盈门。原来设在一座大楼的过道里的朋街高级女子服装店，已成为南京路上一家大型时装店，过去只有半间门面的著名的上海帐子公司，迁进了大楼，三阳南货店、南洋衫袜公司、张小泉剪刀店……几乎所有有名的商店都扩大了门面。此外，在这里还开设了过去所没有的全市最大的皮毛店、珠宝店、绒线店、刺绣店、清真食品店、无线电商店、……。一年来，仅在西藏中路口到外滩约一公里多的地段中，平均每十天就出现一家大型商店。	工人文化宫的常客
    工人文化宫拥挤的厅堂里，一群胸前佩着“上海市工商界政治学校”校徽、手里拿着笔记本的参观者，正在细看上海工人运动史料的图片。
    一位年近古稀的老先生站在王孝和烈士慷慨就义的像片前，肃然地戴上了老光眼镜。记者听到他在对同伴说：没有烈士们流血牺牲，我们那儿会知道社会主义。
    一年之前，工人文化宫热情地接待了第一批工商界人士，他们被称为工人文化宫的新客人。文化宫的负责人告诉记者，这一年来，平均每天都有二百多个合营企业的私方人员到这里来和工会会员们一起参观学习。工商业者在工人文化宫，已经成了经常的客人了。	三访当家作主的人
    翻开去年这时的采访本，找到了一位工人的名字——裕兴棉织厂的周孝兴，立刻想起在动员一百三十万职工投入改造高潮的上海工人代表会议上，他抢在前面讲话的姿态。
    记者到裕兴厂去找他，厂里的人说，周孝兴早已被政府任命为富强织造厂的公方代表了。
    曾经听说过，富强厂公方代表团结私方搞好企业的经验，在区里和专业公司里作过介绍。
    也曾听说过，去年夏天一个早晨，富强厂职工们突然发现一向设在厕所旁边臭气熏天的食堂，已经迁到打扫得干干净净的一间空房里去了。原来是公方代表抽了一个厂星期日，和几个工人一起劳动，不费一文地解决了这个职工长期不满的问题。想不到这个公方代表就是周孝兴。
    记者到富强厂的时候，出来接见的公方代表却是另一位新提拔的本厂工人。他说周孝兴现在是几个厂联合党支部的书记，正在另一个厂研究工作。
    好容易在第三次访问中找到了这位在社会主义改造运动中锻炼出来的新人物——周孝兴，他谦虚地说：“我没有什么经验，不过是以身作则、依靠群众罢了！”
        打开大门一年
    一年前亲手打开了关闭多年的大门、迎接公私合营的信丰铁工厂经理丁骥德，笑吟吟的告诉记者：打开大门一年，企业得到了六万元的利润。
    信丰厂在合营之前，年年亏本，丁骥德错怪大门风水不好，把它紧紧地关着，只用边门。可是债务还是越堆越高，负债超过资产一倍多。
    在各个车间里，到处堆置着修理汽车、电器用的工具。丁骥德说，过去我只是乱拉订货，不管厂里能做不能做，什么都要，结果做不了，脱期罚款是家常便饭。合营后，有专业公司安排生产，专门制造这些工具。企业性质改变后，工人生产热情很高，去年总产值比前年提高80％多。丁骥德去年也得到了四百多元的定息。他说：“打开大门朝社会主义走，走对头了。”
      摊贩当了经理
    在新年中，记者遇到了国营上海市蔬菜公司新任私方副经理张爱国。张爱国不是百万富翁的资本家，只不过是小菜场上几十元小本钱的摊贩。一年以前，他在全市摊贩大会上被公推为十多万摊贩的代表，向人民政府申请公私合营。
    张爱国今年只有三十二岁，但已做了二十年的摊贩。在旧社会里，他还做过拉塌车的助手、医院里的杂务工，过着半失业的日子。
    巧得很，那天正是他就任国营公司副经理两个月的日子。他告诉记者说，在担任新职后有一个心愿，总想使国营公司和摊贩群众团结得像一家人一样。根据这个愿望，他曾向公方经理提出了定期召开摊贩座谈会等五项建议，这五项建议现在已被采纳而付诸实施了。
    六三老人的诗兴
    曾经搁笔多年的上海著名的宝大祥棉布店经理丁方镇老先生，在去年全市改造高潮时诗兴大发，写下了“昨非今是楼”诗稿一卷。热情洋溢的诗句，曾被传诵一时。
    丁老先生现在是上海市公私合营绸布商店联合董事会董事长。听说他笔下轻健，仍在不断作诗。最近记者在董事长办公室里拜访了丁老先生，问他一年来在诗坛耕耘中有何收成。丁老先生说：“一年来工作、学习、生活都非常愉快，闲暇时就以吟诗为乐，大约每天一首，多则三首，至今已写下五百首。”记者不禁为老先生的豪兴吃了一惊。
    老先生说，他今年已六十三岁，在学习上接受能力已较迟钝，但他仍然抱“徐策跑城”的精神，努力追赶，“知难而进”。他告诉记者，一年中除在董事会、市政协学习外，还在业余政治大学学习哲学。最近唯物辩证法一课已学完，在作学习心得时写下了古诗六十首。
    下了舞台以后
    上海市工商联副主任委员胡厥文的夫人沈方成，最近收到了她的好友徐景淑的来信。一年前，她们在上海工商界庆祝社会主义改造胜利的盛大联欢晚会上，成功地演出过根据真人真事自编自导的活报剧
  “王大姐的转变”。在舞台上扮演王大姐夫妇的徐景淑和她的丈夫刘公诚，已经全家搬到北京，刘公诚在建筑材料工业部担任了可以更大地发挥他在水泥工业方面的专长的新职务，徐景淑很高兴地告诉沈方成，她自己也快要走上工作岗位了。
    六十二岁的沈方成正像她在活报剧中扮演的人物一样，是工商界家属中的积极分子；不久前她又一次当选为上海市人民代表。在工商界政治学校第一期学完以后，她又进了政协举办的业余政治大学。在这个学校里，她和老伴胡厥文是同学，不过她读的是政治经济学，而他学的是哲学。
    在活报剧中另一个引人注意的角色——好学的女佣，是由当时的公私合营协大祥棉布店经理孙照明的夫人胡琴贞扮演的。这位原来只有小学程度的四十五岁的家庭妇女，现在是补习学校的高中一年级生了。这几天正在紧张地准备期终考试。
