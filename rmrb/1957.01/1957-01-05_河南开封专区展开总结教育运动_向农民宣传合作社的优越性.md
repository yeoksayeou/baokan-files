Kaifeng Special District, Henan, Launches Summary Education Movement
Publicizing the Superiority of Cooperatives to Farmers

(Our Dispatch) The counties within the Kaifeng Special District of Henan Province are conscientiously summarizing the achievements of the cooperative movement over the past year during the rectification of cooperatives. They are launching a summary education movement among the broad masses of farmers to clarify certain ideological doubts about cooperativization among some farmers and to further encourage the farmers' confidence and enthusiasm for following the socialist path.

The Kaifeng Special District has two thousand four hundred and ten advanced cooperatives, encompassing 99.4% of the district's farm households. These cooperatives, in their production over the past year, have experienced the trials of natural disasters such as drought, floods, pests, and wind, overcoming numerous difficulties and achieving tremendous victories in agricultural production. According to statistics, the per-unit area yield of grain in the entire district increased by 12% compared to 1955. For example, Gong County, which had historically lacked grain, achieved cooperativization and brought its disaster resistance and production capacity into play, increasing the total grain output in 1956 by more than 20 million jin compared to 1955, transforming it from a grain-deficient county to a surplus county. In previous years, the state had to transfer more than five million jin of grain from other areas to supply the rural areas of Gong County. Now, this county not only does not need state support but also sells more than ten million jin of grain to the state. About 87% of the cooperatives in the entire district are consolidated or basically consolidated; 13% of the cooperatives are not consolidated enough. In general, most have been run successfully.

However, some cooperatives, due to poor management and organization of production, have caused production reductions and losses. In the more consolidated cooperatives, various problems exist to varying degrees. As a result, some people have doubts about the superiority of cooperativization and have developed some negative emotions about following the socialist path. In particular, some wealthy peasants always feel that cooperatives are not as good as working individually, constantly finding fault with the cooperatives, blaming all problems on the cooperatives, and even wavering about withdrawing from the cooperatives. For example, among the eight households in Jia Yu Cooperative in Xingyang County who wanted to withdraw, seven were relatively wealthy middle peasants. Under their influence, some people also developed a restless mood. However, in general, although the vast majority of farmers have some opinions about the cooperatives, they are still actively demanding that the cooperatives be run well. For example, Cui Zonghe, a poor peasant in Cuimiao Village, Xingyang, argued, "My opinion is to make the cooperative better, not to break it up. Where can a person like me go after withdrawing from the cooperative?"

Based on these circumstances, various localities, during the rectification of cooperatives, universally adopted the method of using local materials, real people and events, and personal experiences to launch a mass summary education movement among the broad masses of farmers. For example, the Wu’ai Cooperative in Gaowan Township, Gong County, organized its members to contrast their personal experiences of the past year with the hardships of the small-farmer economy era, summarizing "nine things they no longer worry about" after joining the cooperative. In this way, the slack and negative atmosphere in some rural areas changed abruptly, the one-sided views and pessimistic rhetoric that only focused on difficulties and shortcomings were reversed, those who had wavered publicly examined their erroneous thoughts, and those who feared difficulties established confidence in moving forward. A wave of winter production was launched throughout the village.

Now, this mass self-education movement is gradually unfolding throughout the district. The Kaifeng Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party requires all counties to widely organize reporters to go deep into the rural areas and vigorously promote the movement, going from house to house for propaganda. Various organs have also successively dispatched more than 1,700 cadres to go down; Mi County has organized more than 2,000 reporters and propagandists, and sixteen county committee members have gone down separately; some other counties have held cadre mobilization meetings, and a large number of cadres have gone to the countryside to strengthen leadership.

    河南开封专区展开总结教育运动
    向农民宣传合作社的优越性
    本报讯　河南开封专区各县在整社中认真总结一年来合作化运动的成果，向广大农民展开总结教育运动，以澄清部分农民对合作化的某些思想疑虑，进一步鼓舞农民走社会主义道路的信心和积极性。
    开封专区共有二千四百一十个高级社，包括全区99.4％的农户。这些社在一年来生产中，经历了旱、涝、虫、风等自然灾害的考验，克服了重重困难，在农业生产上获得了巨大的胜利。据统计全区粮食单位面积产量比1955年提高12％。如历年缺粮的巩县，由于实现了合作化，发挥了抗灾生产的能力，1956年粮食总产量比1955年增加二千多万斤，由缺粮县变成了余粮县。往年国家要从外地调入五百多万斤粮供应巩县农村，现在这个县不但不要国家支援，反而卖给国家一千来万斤粮。全区合作社约有87％的社是巩固或基本上是巩固的；有13％的社不够巩固。总的来说，大部分是办得成功的。
    但是，有部分社由于经营管理不善，生产组织不好等等原因，造成减产损失；在比较巩固的社里，也程度不等地存在各种问题，于是就有一些人对合作化的优越性发生了怀疑，对走社会主义道路产生了某些消极情绪。特别是有些富裕农民，总觉得合作社不如自己单干好，处处找合作社的毛病，把一切问题都归罪于合作社，甚至动摇退社。如荥阳县贾峪社八户闹退社的户，其中有七户就是较富裕的中农。在他们的影响下，有些人就也产生了动荡不安的情绪。但是，总的来说，绝大多数农民虽然对社也有些意见，他们还是积极要求把社办好的。如荥阳崔庙村有个贫农崔宗和人争辩说：“我有意见是为了想把社办好，不是想把社闹散，像我这样人出社到那里去。”
    根据这些情况，各地在整社中，普遍采用就地取材、真人实事、现身说法的办法，向广大农民展开了群众性的总结教育运动。如巩县?湾乡五爱社，组织社员以自己入社一年的亲身体会，对比小农经济时代的苦处，总结出入社“九不愁”。这样一来，农村某些松劲消极空气顿然改变，那些只看困难和缺点的片面说法和悲观论调得到扭转，曾经动摇的人当众检讨自己的错误思想，怕困难的人树立起前进的信心。全村开展起冬季生产的热潮。
    现在，这个群众性的自我教育运动正在全区逐步展开。中共开封地委要求各县广泛组织报告员深入农村，大张旗鼓地深入家户进行宣传。各机关也已先后抽调干部一千七百多人深入下去，密县已组织了二千多个报告员和宣传员，十六个县委委员已分别深入下去；其他县有些已举行了干部动员大会，大批干部分头下乡加强领导。
