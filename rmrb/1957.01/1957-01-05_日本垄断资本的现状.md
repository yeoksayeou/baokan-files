The Current Situation of Japanese Monopoly Capital
	Lan Hai

In recent years, Japanese monopoly capital has significantly strengthened.

By August 1956, Japan's industrial and mining production index had exceeded the pre-war level (1934-36 average) by a factor of 1.28. The accumulation and concentration of production are roughly approaching the pre-war state, and the banking and enterprise organization systems of the old Zaibatsu systems such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo have been strengthened again. Although cartels are prohibited by the "Anti-Monopoly Law," they are actually being promoted openly or secretly in various industrial sectors. Some large enterprises have updated and expanded their fixed capital. Some enterprises have already exported capital to Central and South America and Southeast Asia.

The reactionary forces representing Japanese monopoly capital were severely weakened after the war. It was spared from complete annihilation under the impact of the Japanese people only because of the protection of the American occupiers. American imperialism regards Japan as its most reliable base for aggression in Asia. Especially since the Korean War, in order to make Japan its base and arsenal for direct military action, the United States has adopted a policy of actively supporting the Japanese reactionary forces centered on monopoly capital. Therefore, while the United States concluded the San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan in September 1951, granting Japan the status of an "independent country," it forced Japan to accept the US-Japan Security Treaty, stipulating that the United States would station troops and establish military bases in Japan indefinitely and occupy the Okinawa Islands for a long time.

This US policy toward Japan has enabled Japanese monopoly capital to intensify its exploitation and plunder of Japanese workers, peasants, and small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators, and to accelerate capital accumulation.

According to statistics from Japanese economists such as Ikuo Takui, the cumulative amount of surplus value extracted from Japanese workers from 1946 to 1953 was approximately 7.3 trillion yen. According to a survey by the Japanese Ministry of Finance, in the ten years after the war, the total internal and external funds of Japanese enterprises (calculated at 1954 prices) reached 12 trillion yen, which is 1.4 times more than the 5 trillion yen in the ten years before the war. These figures show that in the post-war capital accumulation, in addition to extracting surplus value from the working class, there was also heavy exploitation of the masses of people, such as farmers, salaried workers, and small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators, through means such as monopoly prices, taxes, and inflation. During this period, the cumulative investment of the state in private enterprises (calculated at 1955 prices) reached 1 trillion yen.

It can be seen that the speed of capital accumulation in Japan after the war was higher than before the war. The speed of recovery, expansion of production equipment, and expansion of production in Japan and West Germany are very prominent among capitalist countries. In the ten years after the war, the funds invested in updating and expanding fixed capital totaled 12.1 trillion yen at 1955 prices. From 1950 to 1955, an average of 18.1% of the total social output value was used for the renewal and expansion of fixed capital. In this way, the capacity of production equipment has doubled compared to pre-war levels. This is not only a quantitative expansion. The adoption of modern technology has improved labor productivity and improved the quality of commodities, which has strengthened Japan's competitive power in the capitalist world market, and this cannot be ignored. In the capitalist mode of production, the improvement of labor productivity means the increase of labor intensity, which intensifies the degree of exploitation of workers. The portion of commodity production costs that is reduced is not used to lower prices for the benefit of the working people, but becomes capital profit while maintaining monopoly prices. According to a survey by the Ministry of Labor, although labor productivity increased by 47% compared to 1955 and 1951, actual wages only increased by 26%.

From 1950 to 1955, Japan's production increased twofold, but the number of employed people only increased by 20%. According to a survey by the Ministry of Labor, the number of completely unemployed people increased from 440,000 to 680,000 during the same period; and most of the increase in employment was in scattered small and medium-sized enterprises with very poor working conditions, which is actually equivalent to semi-unemployment. The 1956 annual report of the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare also admitted: "Behind Japan's economic recovery, there are still many people who have not benefited." There were 11,620,000 people who were eligible for "livelihood protection law" due to livelihood difficulties. However, only 1.9 million people actually enjoyed livelihood protection.

Due to the implementation of "land reform" in Japan after the war, most tenant farmers became owner-cultivators. The living standards of farmers have generally improved compared to pre-war levels. However, farm household income peaked in 1951 and declined year by year until 1954. There was a slight improvement in 1955 due to a bumper harvest. According to figures released by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, despite two consecutive years of bumper harvests by 1956, farmers' income was still 5% to 6% lower than the previous year. The number of farm households that cannot maintain their livelihoods solely through agricultural income, that is, the so-called part-time farming households, accounted for 44% of the total number of farm households in the second year of "land reform" (1947), and increased to 61% by 1954.

From this, it seems that the Japanese economy is trending toward two extremes. One extreme is the increase in monopolies and the snowballing of capital accumulation; the other extreme is the increasing exploitation of workers, the increasingly impoverished lives, the bleak future of small and medium-sized enterprises, and the stagnation and new class differentiation of agricultural management development. This stark contrast reflects the trend of the Japanese economy in the ten years after the war, and it is also the basic contradiction of Japanese society today.

The development and deepening of this contradiction makes consumption unable to adapt to the expansion of production. Production has increased to twice the pre-war level, while people's consumption levels have only increased by 20%, even according to exaggerated official statistics.

Today, this contradiction has not erupted into an economic crisis, and Japanese monopoly capital can continue to expand reproduction and obtain unprecedented high profits after the war because exports have increased since the summer of 1954. This has not only alleviated the contradiction between production and consumption, but also increased investment in the renewal and expansion of fixed capital since the second half of 1955. However, this good time is only temporary, because the basic contradictions in the Japanese economy cannot be overcome.

To maintain the current good times, Japanese monopoly capital must continue to strengthen its competitive ability in the market. To strengthen its competitive ability, it must continuously increase investment, expand fixed capital, modernize production equipment, and improve labor productivity. In this way, it must obtain higher profits to strengthen capital accumulation. As a result, it will inevitably continue to intensify the plunder and exploitation of the Japanese working people. According to a survey by the Ministry of Finance, the amount of profit announced by various companies was 88.8 billion yen in the first half of 1955 (an increase of 16% compared to the previous period), while it was 125.3 billion yen in the first half of 1956 (an increase of 28% compared to the previous period), while the living standards of the working people cannot be improved. Workers in the Japanese steel industry and shipbuilding industry cannot even get a limited wage increase of 2,000 yen. Fertilizer industry capitalists are unwilling to lower monopoly prices, and textile industry capitalists are also unwilling to lower product prices.

However, excessive investment often causes inflation, which poses the danger of causing an economic crisis, so monopoly capital strongly demands that the government stabilize currency through "balanced fiscal revenue and expenditure." This also means further reducing the social insurance expenditures that the people resolutely demand, and cutting back on subsidies for the unemployed and the impoverished, education and cultural expenditures, and disaster relief expenses, etc. This demand of monopoly capital also contradicts its plans to expand armaments. In addition, in order to drastically expand reproduction, the steel, electricity, and transportation capacity, which have become the foundation of the entire industry, have felt serious shortages and urgently need to be resolved. Furthermore, in order to realize industrial modernization and further expand the scale of the economy, how to improve the industrial infrastructure such as roads, ports, and industrial water is also a difficult problem at present.

The actual situation of Japanese monopoly capital at present is that production is increasing rapidly, the domestic market cannot be expanded, and it is in a very difficult situation. Japanese monopoly capital is paying more and more attention to the Chinese market, paying close attention to Japanese-Soviet trade after the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, and is trying its best to open up the Southeast Asian market and strengthen trade ties with Asian and African countries. The reason lies here.

    日本垄断资本的现状
    蓝海
    近些年来，日本垄断资本有显著增强。
    到1956年8月，日本工矿业生产指数已超过战前水平（1934—36年平均数）一点二八倍。生产的积聚和集中大体接近战前的状态，三井、三菱、住友等旧财阀系统的银行和企业组织系统再度加强。尽管卡特尔被“垄断禁止法”所禁止，但实际上仍公开或秘密地在各产业部门中推广起来。一些大企业对固定资本进行了更新和扩大。一部分企业已把资本输出到中南美洲和东南亚。
    代表日本垄断资本的反动势力，在战后遭到严重削弱。它在日本人民的冲击下得以免于全部溃灭，只是因为有美国占领者的庇护。美帝国主义把日本看作它侵略亚洲的最可靠的基地，特别是从朝鲜战争以来，美国为了使日本成为它的直接军事行动的基地和兵工厂，对以垄断资本为中心的日本反动势力，采取了积极扶植的政策。因此，美国在1951年9月同日本缔结旧金山和约，赋予日本“独立国”地位的同时，迫使日本接受了美日安全保障条约，规定美国在日本无限期地驻扎军队和设立军事基地，长期占领冲绳诸岛。
    美国的这种对日政策，使日本垄断资本得以加紧对日本工农、中小工商业者进行剥削和掠夺，加速资本的积累。
    据日本经济学家井汲卓一等的统计，从1946年到1953年，日本工人被榨取的剩余价值累计额约为七万三千亿日元。据日本政府大藏省调查，在战后十年内，日本企业的内外资金合计（按1954年价格计算）达十二万亿日元，比战前十年的五万亿日元多一点四倍。这些数字表明，在战后的资本积累中，除了从工人阶级身上榨取剩余价值外，还有以垄断价格、税收、通货膨胀等手段对农民、薪资收入者、中小工商业者等人民大众的苛重搜刮。在这段时间里，国家对私营企业的投资额（按1955年价格计算）累计达一万亿日元。
    由此可见，战后日本资本积累的速度比战前高。而生产设备的恢复、扩充和生产扩大的速度，日本和西德在资本主义国家里同是十分突出的。战后十年间，为使固定资本更新、扩大而投下的资金，以1955年价格计算，共达十二万一千亿日元。从1950年到1955年六年间，在社会总产值中平均有18.1％用于固定资本的更新和扩大。这样，生产设备的能力扩大到战前的二倍。这不单是量的扩大。由于采用了现代化技术，提高了劳动生产率，改进了商品质量，使日本在资本主义世界市场上的竞争力量有所加强，这一点是不容忽视的。在资本主义生产方式中，劳动生产率的提高，意味着劳动强度的提高，它加重了对工人剥削的程度。商品生产费用减低的部分，不采取降低物价的办法由劳动人民所得，而是在维持垄断价格之下，变成了资本的利润。根据劳动省的调查，以1955年和1951年相比，劳动生产率虽提高47％，但实际工资却只提高26％。
    从1950年到1955年这五年内，日本的生产虽然增加了两倍，但就业人数只增加20％。据劳动省调查，同期间完全失业者从四十四万人增加到六十八万人；而增加的就业人数中，大部分是在劳动条件很坏的分散的中小企业中工作，实际上等于半失业。日本政府厚生省1956年年度报告中也承认：“在日本经济复兴的后面，还有很多人没有得到好处”，因生活困难而适于享受“生活保护法”的有一千一百六十二万人。但实际享受生活保护法的只有一百九十万人。
    日本在战后由于实行“土地改革”，大部分的佃农成了自耕农。农民的生活水平一般说来比起战前有了提高。但农家的收入以1951年为顶点，到1954年为止年年下降，1955年因为丰收稍有好转。据农林省发表的数字，到1956年尽管连续有两年丰收，农民收入仍比前一年减少5％至6％。光靠农业收入不能维持生计的农户，即所谓兼营农业的户数，在“土地改革”的第二年（1947年）占总农户的44％，到1954年则增加到61％。
    由此看来，日本的经济正趋向两个极端，一个极端是垄断增加，资本积累愈滚愈大；另一个极端是工人遭受剥削日益加重，生活更加穷困，中小企业者前途暗淡，农业经营发展的停滞和新的阶级分化。这一鲜明的对比，反映了战后十年来日本经济的趋势，也是今天日本社会的基本矛盾。
    这个矛盾的发展和加深，使消费不能适应生产的扩大。生产增加到战前的两倍，而人民的消费水平即使按照官方夸大了的统计也不过增加20％。
    今天，这个矛盾没有爆发为经济危机，日本垄断资本还能继续扩大再生产并获得战后空前的高额利润，是因为1954年夏季以来输出有了增加。这不仅缓和了生产和消费之间的矛盾，并且从1955年下半年以后，用于固定资本的更新和扩大的投资又有了增加。但是，这种好光景只是暂时的，因为日本经济中的基本矛盾是没有办法克服的。
    日本垄断资本要维持当前的好光景，必须继续加强自己在市场上的竞争能力，而要加强竞争能力，就必须不断地增加投资，扩大固定资本，使生产设备现代化，并提高劳动生产率。这样，它就必须获得更高的利润，以加强资本的积累。结果，它势必继续加紧对日本劳动人民的掠夺和榨取。据大藏省调查，各公司公布的赢利额在1955年上半期为八百八十八亿日元（比前一个时期增加16％），而1956年上半期则为一千二百五十三亿日元（比前一时期增加28％），而劳动人民的生活水平却不能提高。日本钢铁工业和造船工业工人要求增加有限的二千日元工资，都不能做到。肥料工业资本家不愿降低垄断价格，纤维工业资本家也不愿降低产品价格。
    但是，由于过分的投资常常会引起通货膨胀，有引起经济危机的危险，垄断资本就强烈地要求政府以“财政收支平衡”的手段来稳定通货。这也就是要更加减少人民坚决要求的社会保险开支，削减失业者和生活穷困者的补助费、文教费和救灾费用等等。垄断资本的这种要求，同它扩张军备的打算也有矛盾。还有，为了急剧地扩大再生产，目前那些成为整个产业基础的钢铁、电力、运输力都已感到严重的不足，迫切地需要加以解决。再就是为了实现工业现代化和更进一步地扩大经济规模，如何搞好道路、港湾、工业用水等这些产业基础，也是当前的一个难题。
    目前日本垄断资本的实际情况是，生产迅速增加，国内市场不能扩大，正处于非常困难的境地。日本垄断资本对中国市场越来越关心，对日苏恢复邦交后的日苏贸易十分注意，并极力开辟东南亚市场，同亚非国家加强贸易联系，其理由就在这里。
