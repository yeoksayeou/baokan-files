Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Ostrovsky's wife met with more than 1,300 young people in Beijing today in a hall at the Beijing Hotel.

　　Ostrovsky's wife told the youth that she knew Chinese youth had boundless love for Ostrovsky, a man who dedicated his life to the revolutionary cause. She spoke with great emotion about the characters in the book "How the Steel Was Tempered," which the youth are familiar with. She said: Not long ago, I met Tonya in Ukraine, she is living and working very well, but her real name is not Tonya, it is Lyuba. Paul's brother is now working in Moscow, he is fifty-six years old this year, and he is still as strong-willed and energetic as he was in the novel, contributing his strength to the communist cause of the motherland. Finally, she hoped that the Chinese youth would be as tenacious and tirelessly fight like Paul, and never retreat in the face of difficulties.

　　After she finished speaking, a young girl from the Paul Class of Beijing No. 2 Girls' Middle School ran to the podium and presented her with a bouquet of flowers. Then Sun Jinghao, a student from the Paul Class of Beijing No. 65 Middle School, excitedly said that we are students of Paul and Ostrovsky, and we must follow Ostrovsky's life path and train ourselves to be as hard as steel. Beijing youth also recited a poem at the meeting dedicated to "Paul lives forever in our hearts."

    奥斯特洛夫斯基的夫人同北京青年见面
    新华社20日讯　奥斯特洛夫斯基的夫人今日在北京饭店的一座大厅里，同北京一千三百多个青年见了面。
    奥斯特洛夫斯基的夫人向青年们说她知道中国青年对奥斯特洛夫斯基，一个把生命献给革命事业的人是无限热爱的。她充满感情地谈到了青年们所熟悉的“钢铁是怎样炼成的”这本书中的人物近况。她说：不久前，我在乌克兰见到了冬尼亚，她生活工作得很好，不过她的真名不叫冬尼亚，叫柳芭。保尔的哥哥，现在莫斯科工作，今年已五十六岁了，他仍像小说中所写的那样意志坚强，精神饱满，为祖国的共产主义事业贡献着力量。最后她希望中国青年像保尔一样顽强，一样不懈地战斗，在困难面前决不退却。
    她讲完话以后，北京市第二女子中学保尔班的一个年轻姑娘跑上讲台，向她献了一束鲜花。接着北京市第六十五中学保尔班的学生孙敬灏激动地说，我们是保尔、也是奥斯特洛夫斯基的学生，我们一定要遵循着奥斯特洛夫斯基的生活道路，把自己锻炼成钢铁样的坚硬。北京青年还在会上朗颂了一首献诗：“保尔永远活在我们心里”。
