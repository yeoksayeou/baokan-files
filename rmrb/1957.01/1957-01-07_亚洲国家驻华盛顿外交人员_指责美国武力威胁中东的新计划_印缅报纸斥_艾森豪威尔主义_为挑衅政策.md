Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 6th: According to a report on the 5th by the Washington correspondent of the Cairo "Al-Ahram", almost all representatives of Middle Eastern and Asian countries in Washington are uneasy about the new US plan to enslave the Middle East. The reporter, in a report issued on the same day that Eisenhower submitted a message to Congress on the Middle East issue, said that the reaction of the countries of the Asian-African Group to the US plan was "quite cold." Representatives of Asian countries criticized the US plan as being "mainly based on threats of force."

The "Al-Ahram" reporter also said that many diplomatic observers believe that the United States' idea of ​​filling the so-called "vacuum" created by the loss of prestige of Britain and France is a "fundamental mistake" in the United States' consideration of the current Middle East issue.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 6th: The Indian "National Herald" said on January 4 that the new plan proposed by the United States for the Middle East is "just a provocation," and that talk about the so-called Middle East vacuum is "mostly fabricated." The newspaper's editorial emphasized that Arab countries "will never sacrifice their self-esteem and security in exchange for assistance."

The Urdu daily "Hinduistan" on January 4 believed that the US plan "is the most dangerous step for Asia and the Near East."

The "Bombay Chronicle" on January 3 asked, "Whose security does this American policy want to defend?" The newspaper then pointed out that this policy "does not respect the recognized fact that West Asian countries enjoy sovereignty and independence." The newspaper also pointed out that "an example of the US's biased attitude towards the West Asian issue is Dulles' notorious plan to internationalize the Suez Canal (which hindered Egypt's interests and sovereignty)."

The Bengali daily "Azad" published an editorial on the 2nd saying that the US's "filling the vacuum" plan is to "maintain imperialist rule over Middle Eastern countries" after Britain and France. The newspaper said: "After their imperialist conspiracies in Egypt and Hungary were defeated, the war-mongering groups desperately maintained the tension of the Cold War in the Middle East and other parts of the world."

Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, 6th: The English-language "The Burmese" newspaper published an editorial commenting on the "Eisenhower Doctrine," saying that most Asian people would certainly "regard it as an illegitimate means of interfering in the sovereign independence of Middle Eastern countries."

The editorial emphasized: "There is no such thing as a Middle East vacuum caused by the incompetence of Britain and France. Only those countries with imperialist ideas who hope to expand their sphere of influence to achieve their selfish goals will use this terminology."

The newspaper said: "If the Eisenhower Doctrine is implemented, it will only create more problems in that part of the world and elsewhere."

The newspaper pointed out that the "Eisenhower Plan" not only sounds untimely, but also shows that the ultimate goal of the United States is to take on the so-called "white man's burden," which Britain, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain have only recently, very reluctantly and with great difficulty, relinquished.

    亚洲国家驻华盛顿外交人员
    指责美国武力威胁中东的新计划
    印缅报纸斥“艾森豪威尔主义”为挑衅政策
    新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：据开罗“金字塔报”驻华盛顿记者5日报道，华盛顿几乎所有的中东国家和亚洲国家的代表都对美国奴役中东的新计划感到不安。这个记者在艾森豪威尔向国会提出中东问题咨文的同一天发出的报道说，亚非集团的国家对美国这项计划的反应“相当冷淡”。亚洲国家的代表批评美国的这项计划“主要是以武力威胁为基础”。
      “金字塔报”记者还说，许多外交观察家认为，美国想要填充英法由于丧失威信而造成的所谓“真空”的想法，是美国在考虑目前中东问题方面的“基本错误”。
    新华社新德里6日电　印度“国民先驱报”1月4日说，美国提出的对中东的新计划“只是一种挑衅”，而关于所谓中东真空的谈论，“大半是凭空想出的”。这家报纸的社论着重指出，阿拉伯国家“决不愿牺牲自尊心和安全来换取援助”。
    1月4日的乌尔都文日报“印度文汇报”认为美国的计划“对亚洲和近东来说是最危险的步骤”。
    1月3日的“孟买纪事报”问道，“美国的这个政策想卫护的是谁的安全呢”？这家报纸接着指出，这个政策“不尊重西亚国家享有主权和获得独立这个公认的事实”。这家报纸还指出，“美国对西亚问题采取的偏袒的态度的一个例子是杜勒斯的臭名昭著的苏伊士运河国际化计划（这个计划是妨碍埃及的利益和主权的）”。
    孟加拉文日报“自由报”2日发表社论说，美国的“填塞真空”的计划是要继英法之后“维持帝国主义对中东国家的统治”。这家报纸说：“战争贩子集团在它们在埃及和匈牙利进行的帝国主义阴谋遭到失败以后，就拚命在中东和世界其他地区保持冷战的紧张局势。”
    新华社仰光6日电　英文“缅甸人报”发表的评论“艾森豪威尔主义”的社论说，大多数亚洲人民一定会“把它看作一种干涉中东国家的主权独立的不正当的手段”。
    社论强调指出：“根本就不存在由于英法无能而造成的中东真空这样的东西。只有那些抱着帝国主义思想，希望扩展它们的势力范围以达到它们的自私目的的国家，才会利用这种术语。”
    报纸说：“如果艾森豪威尔主义付诸实施，那只会使世界那个地区和其他地方增加更多问题。”
    报纸指出，“艾森豪威尔计划”听起来不仅是不合时宜的，而且还表明，美国的最终的目的是想把英国、法国、荷兰、葡萄牙和西班牙最近才非常勉强地、非常不容易地放下的所谓“白种人的担子”挑起来。
