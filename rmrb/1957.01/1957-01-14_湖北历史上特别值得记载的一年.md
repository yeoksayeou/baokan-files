    A Year Particularly Worth Recording in Hubei History
    Hai Bo
    1956 was a year particularly worth recording in the history of Hubei Province. Because it was the first year of agricultural collectivization, and because this year brought an unprecedented bumper harvest to the people of Hubei Province.
    When golden rice and silver cotton filled both banks of the Yangtze River, the vast number of farmers shouted in unison: "It's a bumper harvest!" "An unprecedented bumper harvest!" Young men and women began to plan how to use their labor income to dress themselves up more beautifully, while older farmers thought even more. A deaf old man in Macheng County received a new cotton quilt sent by the cooperative after the bumper harvest, and he was so happy that he woke up laughing in the middle of the night. As a result of the bumper harvest, more than 90% of the cooperatives and more than 85% of the members in the province increased their income. Some increased their income by one or two times, and some increased it by several tenths. Now, agricultural cooperatives have completed the tasks of public grain and grain purchase ahead of schedule according to national regulations. At the same time, they sold a large amount of surplus grain to the state. Many docks along the Yangtze and Han Rivers and railway stations on the Beijing-Han and Guangdong-Han railways that run through Hubei are also particularly busy because of the province's unprecedented bumper harvest. Packages of grain and cotton are transported by water and land to the disaster areas of Hebei.
    The agricultural harvest in Hubei Province in 1956 was outstanding: the grain output of Hubei Province reached 21 billion jin, which was 11.7% higher than in 1955, exceeding the 1957 national plan target by 15.9%, and 4 billion jin more than the highest annual output before the Anti-Japanese War. The output of ginned cotton reached 4 million dan, an increase of 37.13% over 1955 (the highest annual output before the war was only 2.554 million dan), exceeding the 1957 national plan target by 30.7%. The output of soybeans increased by 58% compared with 1955. The output of other crops also increased significantly.
    The unprecedented bumper harvest made the farmers of Hubei Province see miracles they had never seen before. In the past, high-yield fields were only sporadic and small, but this year, large-scale high-yield fields appeared. According to preliminary statistics from the four special districts of Xiaogan, Huanggang, Jingzhou, and Yichang, there were 1,187 cooperatives with an average grain yield of 1,000 jin per mu; and 506 cooperatives with an average ginned cotton yield of 100 jin per mu. The 63.3 mu of double-cropping rice in Shuangtai Cooperative, Wolong Township, Xiaogan County, had an average yield of 1,164 jin per mu, of which 6.65 mu of land had an average yield of 2,023 jin per mu. The wheat in Minle Agricultural Cooperative, Shenwan Township, Gucheng County, yielded an average of more than 500 jin per mu, of which 7.4 mu had an average yield of 1,052.5 jin per mu. The 1.07 mu of cotton in Shiban Agricultural Cooperative, Jingshan County, on the Jianghan Plain, produced 407.7 jin of ginned cotton. In Xiangyang area, which was historically considered a low-yield area, the average yield of cotton per mu also increased from more than 10 jin to nearly 30 jin last year, and many cotton fields with a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu appeared.
    The emergence of these miracles has attracted the attention of everyone in the province. People have different explanations for the reasons for the bumper harvest. Some people think that this is mainly a gift from "heaven" because of "good weather." But many people disagree with this statement. Because they are clear that 1956 was not so "good weather." For example, in the Huanggang and Echeng areas, which are rich in rice, there has been no heavy rain from mid-July to December. The local farmers have been working hard to fight drought. Enshi suffered four floods, the severity of which was unprecedented in forty years. The rainfall and water level of the Xiang River in Xiangyang area exceeded those of 1954. Red spiders and other pests once spread over the vast cotton fields on the Jianghan Plain, and large hailstones also damaged crops. Obviously, the "heaven" of 1956 was much worse than the so-called "receiving from the top of the mountain to the bottom of the lake" "heaven" of Hubei Province in 1953, but it achieved a greater bumper harvest than in 1953! Can we still attribute the bumper harvest entirely to "heaven"?
    What exactly is going on? In the words of the farmers themselves: it is "because of the cooperative!"
    During the spring plowing of 1956, 86% of the farmers in Hubei Province joined agricultural production cooperatives, of which 68% joined advanced cooperatives. This change enabled many things that could not and dared not be done in the countryside in the past to be done and dared to be done. In this year, Hubei Province proposed and implemented a series of production increase measures centered on "five reforms": changing one-season crops to two-season crops or two-season crops to three-season crops, changing dry land to paddy fields, using improved varieties, changing low-yield crops to high-yield crops, and changing sloping fields to terraced fields. These reforms have achieved great success. In 1956, the area of double-cropping rice in the province had increased to 2.75 million mu, an increase of 175% over 1955; 5 million mu of dry land had been converted into paddy fields; the area of major crops such as rice, cotton, and wheat that used improved varieties had reached 26.7 million mu; among them, the area of rice that used improved varieties increased by more than doubled compared with 1955, and the area of cotton that used improved varieties expanded by 314%; more than 1 million mu of low-yield crops were converted into high-yield crops; and 220,000 mu of sloping fields were converted into terraced fields. These reforms alone increased grain production by about 800 million jin.
    Early sowing, close planting, and increased fertilization, which require a lot of labor, have made remarkable achievements in the province. Rice seedlings were planted 10 to 15 days earlier than in the past, and cotton was sown 15 to 20 days earlier than in previous years. Each mu of rice increased by 30% to 60%, and each mu of cotton field planted more than 1,000 more plants than in the past. The amount of fertilizer increased by 30% to 60% compared with previous years. This made early rice mature more than ten days earlier, creating conditions for the bumper harvest of regenerated rice. Cotton, due to proper early sowing, had more summer bolls, larger autumn bolls, early harvest, and good quality. Due to sufficient fertilizer, various crops generally grew well.
    It is particularly worth pointing out the struggle of cooperatives to overcome disasters. Last year, when rice needed water the most, many areas did not have heavy rain for more than two months. Pests had spread to most of the rice and cotton fields, but all these difficulties were successfully overcome. During the period when the summer drought seriously threatened the rice, the farmers put forward the slogan of "fighting for grain against drought." In the areas around Echeng and Wuchang, one waterwheel was connected to another, and dozens of waterwheels were connected together, crossing mountains and ridges to draw water from dozens of miles away to the fields, saving the seedlings. During the period of severe insect pests, many counties often maintained an army of tens of thousands of people to kill insects. During the period of exterminating rice borers, the province lit 1.1 million moth-attracting lamps alone. Many cotton fields were treated with pesticides more than ten times, and the area of insect control in the province reached more than 20 million mu. These struggles have played a huge role in ensuring increased production.
    The province's comprehensive increase in production was achieved through a series of complex organizational work. After the basic realization of collectivization in the province, comprehensive production development plans were formulated from the province to the township and cooperative levels. The vast number of farmers saw their beautiful prospects for the first time, and their enthusiasm for production soared. Socialist labor competitions were widely launched in various cooperatives, and a province-wide production upsurge appeared.
    In the production movement, Hubei Province paid special attention to fully relying on the masses and resolutely and correctly implementing the principle of distribution according to labor, thereby further stimulating the enthusiasm of farmers for production. Li Anlun of Liyuan Second Cooperative in Macheng County was afraid of suffering losses before the distribution, and only two of the four people worked in the fields; after the reasonable distribution, all four people immediately went to the fields to find work.
    The help of the Party and the government to agricultural cooperatives has also played a significant role in the bumper harvest. Last year, the state trained tens of thousands of agricultural technology cadres and administrative cadres, established a large number of technical guidance stations, and helped farmers solve the problems encountered in technical reforms. At the same time, it also supplied a large number of commercial fertilizers, pesticides, and various agricultural tools. The province also issued agricultural loans of 160 million yuan, which solved the problem of production funds.
    After agricultural collectivization, many new problems and difficulties have emerged in rural areas, but the farmers of Hubei Province have deeply realized that with the specific leadership and concern of the Party, these problems can be solved. In the spring of 1956, when the cooperatives were just established, poor management and waste of labor were very common. At this time, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China organized work teams headed by secretaries and members to go deep into the countryside. Nearly 2,000 cadres were transferred from provincial-level agencies alone. At the same time, party committees at all levels also went deep into the grassroots under the leadership of the secretaries, and many cadres personally helped farmers with their work to solve problems in their work, so that the production movement could be launched quickly. Various places also adopted the method of battlefield meetings, solving one problem at a time. This method was flexible, simple, and timely, and helped to overcome bureaucracy.
    The newly established cooperative is just like a child learning to walk, and it cannot be smooth sailing. Therefore, Hubei Province also had its shortcomings in leading agricultural production in the past year. For example, in the promotion of japonica rice varieties, some areas rashly promoted them on a large scale without key trials, resulting in reduced yields of early and medium japonica rice. Some cooperatives set plans that were too high and too large. When some cooperatives began to implement the plans, the basic construction was spread out too much, and too much investment was made, which affected the subsequent production and the income of the members. Some cadres had a very serious style of coercion and command, which affected the production emotions of the masses, and so on. If these problems did not occur, the production results would be even greater.
    All these difficulties are difficulties in progress. The vast number of farmers in Hubei Province have successfully overcome these difficulties, and the vast majority of people have deeply realized the benefits brought to them by collectivization. Therefore, when the autumn harvest of 1956 had not yet ended, many individual farmers and farmers participating in primary cooperatives asked to join advanced cooperatives, forming a new upsurge in joining cooperatives. At the end of the autumn harvest, the number of farmers joining advanced cooperatives in the province reached more than 97% of the total number of farmers in the province, making the province realize advanced collectivization. Now, a winter production movement that is broader and deeper than in previous years has been widely launched throughout the province. Many counties have formulated this year's production plans according to specific circumstances. The general county plans call for grain and cotton production to increase by more than 10% compared with 1956. The vast number of farmers have unanimously stated that they will strive for a greater harvest this year.

    湖北历史上特别值得记载的一年
    海波
    1956年是湖北省历史上特别值得记载的一年。因为它是农业合作化的第一年，因为这一年给湖北省人民带来了空前的大丰收。
    当黄金般的稻谷和白银般的棉花布满长江两岸的时候，广大农民同声欢呼：“丰收啦！”“从来没有的大丰收！”年轻的小伙子们和姑娘们开始计划怎样用劳动所得把自己打扮得更漂亮一些，而老年农民们则想得更多。麻城县有一位聋老爹爹，在丰收后得到了合作社送来的新棉被，他高兴得半夜从梦中笑醒了。丰收的结果使全省90％以上的合作社和85％以上的社员增加了收入。有的收入增加了一两倍，有的增加好几成。现在各农业社已经按照国家规定，提前完成了公粮和购粮任务，同时，又把大批余粮卖给国家。长江、汉水沿岸的许多码头和纵贯湖北的京汉、粤汉铁路的车站，因为全省的空前丰收也特别忙碌起来。一包一包的粮食和棉花，从水路、从陆路运向河北的灾区。
    1956年湖北省农业丰收是突出的：这一年湖北省的粮食产量达到了二百一十亿斤，它比1955年增产11.7％，超过了1957年国家计划指标15.9％，比抗日战争前的最高年产量多四十亿斤。皮棉的产量达到了四百万担，比1955年增产37.13％（战前的最高年产量只是二百五十五点四万担）。超过1957年国家计划指标30.7％。大豆则比1955年增产了58％。其他作物的产量也都有显著的增产。
    空前的大丰收，使湖北省农民看到了过去从未见过的奇迹。过去高额丰产田只是零星的、小块的，这一年大面积丰产田出现了。据孝感、黄冈、荆州、宜昌四个专区的初步统计，粮食平均亩产千斤的合作社就有一千一百八十七个；平均亩产皮棉百斤的合作社就有五百零六个。孝感县卧龙乡双台社双季稻六十三点三亩，平均每亩产量达一千一百六十四斤，其中有六点六五亩田，每亩平均产量是二千零二十三斤。谷城县沈湾乡民乐农业合作社的小麦，平均每亩产五百多斤，其中有七点四亩，每亩平均产量达到了一千零五十二点五斤。江汉平原上的京山县石板农业合作社有一点零七亩棉花产皮棉四百零七点七斤。历史上被认为是低产地区的襄阳一带，去年的棉花也由每亩平均产皮棉十多斤提高到近三十斤左右，并且还出现了不少亩产皮棉百斤的棉田。
    这些奇迹的出现，引起了全省每个人的注意，人们对丰收的原因作种种解释，有的人认为：这主要是“天”的恩赐，是因为“风调雨顺”。但是很多人不同意这种说法。因为他们清楚，1956年并不是那么“风调雨顺”。如盛产稻谷的黄冈、鄂城一带，从7月中旬一直到12月，就没下过一次透雨，当地的农民一直在紧张地进行抗旱。恩施发生了四次水灾，其严重程度为四十年来所未有。襄阳专区雨量和襄河的水位，都超过了1954年。红蜘蛛和其他害虫曾经蔓延了江汉平原上的广大棉田，大个儿的冰雹也曾打坏了庄稼。显然，1956年的“天”比1953年湖北省的所谓“从山顶收到湖底”的“天”要坏得多，但是却比1953年获得了更大的丰收！这还把丰收完全归功于“天”吗？
    到底是怎么回事呢？用农民自己的话来说：是“因为有了合作社！”
    1956年春耕时，湖北省有86％的农户加入了农业生产合作社，其中68％的农户加入了高级社。这个变化，使农村很多过去不能做、不敢做的事情都能做和敢做了。在这一年中，湖北省提出并贯彻执行了以“五项改革”为中心的增产措施：一季作物改为二季作物或二季作物改为三季作物，旱田改水田，改用良种，低产作物改为高产作物，坡田改为梯田。这些改革获得了巨大的成就。1956年全省双季稻面积已经增加到二百七十五万亩，比1955年扩大了175％；有五百万亩旱田改为水田；主要作物水稻、棉花、小麦改用良种的面积已达二千六百七十万亩；其中水稻改用良种的面积比1955年增加了一倍以上，棉花改用良种的面积扩大了314％；有一百多万亩低产作物改成了高产作物；有二十二万亩坡田改成了梯田。仅这些改革就增产了八亿斤左右的粮食。
    需要大量劳动力的早播、密植和增施肥料等措施，在全省作出了显著成绩。水稻下种比过去提前了十至十五天，棉花播种则比往年提前了十五天至二十天。每亩水稻增加了30％至60％，每亩棉田比过去多种了一千多株。而肥料则比往年增加了30％至60％。这样，就使得早稻提早成熟十多天，为再生稻的丰收创造了条件。棉花由于适当的提前播种，伏桃多、秋桃大、收花早、质量好。由于肥料较充足，各种作物普遍发育良好。
    特别值得指出的是，合作社战胜灾害的斗争。去年，在稻谷最需要水的时候，有不少地区两个多月没下透雨。虫害曾蔓延了大部稻田和棉田，但这一切困难都被胜利地克服了。在夏季旱灾严重威胁着稻禾的时期，农民们提出“与旱争粮”的口号，鄂城、武昌一带地区，一架水车接着一架水车，几十架水车接到一块儿，翻山越岭把几十里以外的水引到田里，救活了秧苗。在虫害严重时期，许多县都经常保持着成万的灭虫大军，在灭水稻螟虫期间，全省光是点的诱蛾灯就有一百一十万盏。很多棉田施药治虫达十多次，全省治虫面积达二千多万亩。这些斗争对保证增产起了巨大作用。
    全省全面增产是经过一系列复杂的组织工作的。在全省基本上实现了合作化后，从省到乡、社制订了全面发展生产的规划。广大农民第一次看到了自己的美丽远景，生产热情高涨，各合作社广泛展开了社会主义劳动竞赛，出现了全省范围的生产高潮。
    在生产运动中，湖北省各地特别注意了充分依靠群众，坚决正确贯彻按劳取酬的分配原则，因而进一步发挥了农民生产积极性。麻城县燎原二社李安伦在分配前怕吃了亏，四个人只有两个人下田；进行合理分配后，四个人立即都下了田找活干。
    党和政府对农业合作社的帮助，对丰收也起了很大作用。国家去年训练了成万个农业技术干部和行政干部，建立了大批技术指导站，帮助农民解决了在技术改革中遇到的问题。同时还供应了大批的商品肥料、农药和各种农具，全省还发放了农业贷款一亿六千万元，解决了生产资金的困难。
    农业合作化后农村出现了很多新问题和新困难，但是湖北农民深刻体会到，有党的具体领导和关心，这些问题都是可以解决的。1956年春天，合作社刚成立，经营管理不善，浪费劳动力的现象很普遍，这时，中共湖北省委就组织以书记、委员为首的工作队深入农村，仅省级机关抽调下乡的干部就有近两千个。同时各级党委也在书记带头下深入下层，很多干部还亲自帮助农民干活，解决工作中的问题，使生产运动迅速开展起来。各地还采用战地会议的办法，一次解决一个问题，这种方法，灵活、简便、及时，有助于克服官僚主义。
    新建立起的合作社，正像一个学走路的孩子一样，它不可能是一帆风顺的。因此，湖北省过去一年来在领导农业生产方面也有它的缺点。如在推广粳稻良种上，有些地区没有经过重点试验就冒然大面积推广，因而造成了早粳和中粳减产，有些合作社订的规划过高过大。有些社在开始执行规划时，基本建设铺的摊子很大，投资太多，影响到后来的生产和社员的收入。有些干部强迫命令作风很严重，影响到群众的生产情绪，等等。如果不发生这些毛病，生产成绩将会更大些。
    这一切困难都是前进中的困难，湖北省广大农民胜利地度过了这些困难，绝大多数人已深深认识到合作化给他们带来的好处，因此，当1956年秋收还没有结束的时候，很多单干农民和参加初级社的农民便纷纷要求参加高级社，形成了一个新的入社高潮，在秋收结束的时候，全省加入高级合作社的农户就达到了全省农户总数的97％以上，使全省实现了高级合作化。现在，一个比往年更广大更深入的冬季生产运动已在全省范围内广泛展开，许多县都按具体情况制订了今年的生产规划，一般县的规划，粮食棉花都比1956年增产10％以上。广大农民一致表示要争取今年更大的丰收。
