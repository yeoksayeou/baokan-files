    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou. Zhejiang Province's agricultural departments are preparing to actively promote the use of peat as fertilizer this year. According to the analysis of peat samples from ninety-seven different locations, the nitrogen content of peat in most areas of Zhejiang Province is relatively high, generally around 1.5%, and in many areas above 2%. Its nitrogen content is higher than tea seed cake, and not lower than air-dried grass seeds or compost and manure. Applying West Lake peat to corn fields and continuous late rice fields can generally increase production by 7% to 8%.
    After discovering large quantities of peat in more than forty counties and the West Lake District of Hangzhou, and after two years of analysis and research by scientists from the Soil and Fertilizer Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Science Institute, it is believed that the quality of these peats is very good, and they have provided a rich new source of fertilizer for various crops in Zhejiang Province.

    浙江准备推广泥炭肥料
    据新华社杭州电　浙江省农业部门准备在今年积极推广利用泥炭作肥料。根据九十七个不同地点的泥炭样品化验分析，浙江省大部分地区泥炭的含氮量都较高，一般在1.5％左右，不少地区在2％以上。它的氮素含量比茶子饼高，也不低于风干的草子或堆肥、厩肥。用西湖泥炭施放在玉米地里和连作晚稻田里，一般能增产7％到8％。
    在浙江省四十多个县和杭州市西湖区发现大量泥炭后，经浙江省农业科学研究所土壤肥料系的科学工作者两年来的分析研究，认为这些泥炭的质量都很好，已为浙江省各种农作物提供了丰富的新肥源。
