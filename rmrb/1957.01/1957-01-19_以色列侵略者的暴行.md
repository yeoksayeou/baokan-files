    The Atrocities of the Israeli Aggressors
    By our correspondent Jiang Yuanchun
    On January 5th, a group of Egyptian and foreign journalists visited the northern Sinai Peninsula and witnessed firsthand the shocking destruction caused there by the Israeli aggressors, and their crimes of slaughtering innocent civilians and prisoners of war.
    In Ismailia, after crossing the Suez Canal on a pontoon bridge, we entered the Sinai Peninsula. Looking east, a desolate desert stretched out, with some low sand dunes undulating to the south. The midday sun shone on the desert, dazzling the eyes. Our vehicles advanced along a desert road on the east bank of the canal, in the direction of Port Said. Shortly thereafter, we arrived at East Kantara. This place is roughly equidistant from Ismailia and Port Said, and faces West Kantara across the canal, which is currently accessible by a pontoon bridge. West Kantara is small, while East Kantara is larger, with customs, some Canal Company buildings, and an Arab quarter where the local people live. There is a large railway station here. Trains from Cairo pass over the Firdan Bridge not far to the south and then through here to Palestine.
    People led us to a cemetery south of the town of East Kantara. In a graveyard enclosed by a wire fence, there were many brick tombs buried in the sand, some already covered with earth, others not yet covered, with only a piece of old corrugated iron sheet placed over the tomb. Burial workers and soldiers were busy around. A stench of decaying corpses wafted in the wind. An Egyptian officer told us that these were the bodies of Egyptian civilians and soldiers barbarously murdered by the Israeli aggressors in the Sinai Peninsula. From December 14th last year to January 4th, eighty-two such bodies had been buried here. Most of these bodies had traces of having been subjected to cruel torture.
    One body being buried was that of an Egyptian officer. People found it on the side of the road fourteen kilometers from Kantara. The body had already decomposed, and it could be seen that it had been beheaded before death. Now the bones were in a heap. Another female corpse was transported from the Romana station on the railway line forty-two kilometers from Kantara. Israeli troops had locked thirty-eight civilians in a room at the station, and then set up landmines around the building, destroying it. This woman was one of the victims.
    According to an Egyptian Brigadier General in Ismailia, the bodies of seventy-six Egyptian soldiers were also found in a place called “Inshas” south of the railway line. After being captured, their hands were tied behind their backs with wire by the Israeli army, and then they were strangled to death with wire.
    At Kantara station, we boarded a special train with three carriages and headed east. The railway to Palestine, starting not far from Kantara, was almost completely destroyed by the Israeli army. Sixty kilometers have now been repaired, and our train is running on this newly repaired line. Not far south of the railway line is a paved road. This road was also damaged, and only part of it has been repaired.
    The Israeli army used various vicious methods to destroy the railways and roads. They used bulldozers to dig up the sleepers under the rails, and then used bulldozers to crash into the rails from side to side, causing the rails to bend and break. This method was especially used in stations with more tracks. On the line, they used explosives to blow a gap of forty or fifty centimeters wide at the joints of two rails. It was like this all along the way, making the repair work particularly difficult.
    The railway stations along the line were all razed to the ground. The Egyptian side is already carrying out emergency repairs. The walls of the new station buildings have been built on several small stations. The telephone lines along the route have also been completely destroyed. Every telephone pole, whether wooden or iron, was blown up with explosives at a height of about one meter above the ground, and telephone wires were scattered all over the ground. The Egyptian engineering corps is now rushing to repair them, and more than twenty kilometers of new telephone lines have been erected. They are using the original telephone poles, which have been blown askew, and inserting them into the sand in order to restore the line as soon as possible.
    The road was even more severely damaged. This road, paved with nearly five or six centimeters of asphalt, was completely overturned by bulldozers fitted with blades, leaving it in a terrible state. Looking at it, it was just a black, uneven patch of soil, and you would think it was a ploughed field, never imagining that it had once been a good road. Near a small station called Kil Bana, three stations away from Kantara, a team of road workers was busy repairing the road. Barrels of asphalt were piled up like mountains along the road. Beside the road were the tents where the workers lived. A powerful machine for boiling asphalt and mixing sand was rumbling. The workers were running to send the locally sourced sand into the machine's hopper. People are striving to restore the damage caused by the enemy as soon as possible.
    The Sinai Peninsula is a very desolate place. Looking from the train, one sees only desert after desert. On the sand on both sides of the railway and road, there are countless tire tracks, probably left by the retreating Israeli army and the advancing United Nations Emergency Force. In some places, there were scattered scraps of paper. One or two steel helmets could also be seen lying face up next to the small tamarisk trees. By the roadside, one could sometimes see graves burying the dead, with a piece of charred wood erected on the grave as a marker.
    More than an hour later, we arrived at Romana station. Here, a small oasis was formed by a low-lying swamp. Sparrows chirping and date palms with lush foliage appeared in the desert. Romana station was a relatively large station, and all the buildings were destroyed. We saw the place where thirty-eight civilians were killed. In the rubble, there were still scattered clothes, hair, and bloodstains on the stones, and the smell of corpses was overwhelming. Near another destroyed house nearby, there was also a strong smell of corpses, but no excavation had been carried out here. Judging from the state of destruction, this house was also destroyed from the outside with landmines or explosives. Because the ceiling falling on the rubble was relatively complete. This shows that it fell after the walls collapsed first. Otherwise, under any circumstances, the ceiling should have been destroyed first, not the brick walls.
    Beside the well, a civilian dressed in Arab clothing told the journalists that he had escaped from the city of El Arish to the east. According to him, the Israeli army is still occupying the city. According to him, the Israeli army is looting and killing civilians there.
    A gondola car at the Romana station was overturned by the Israeli army with a bulldozer, and many wheels were cracked. The tracks of the station were also distorted and torn apart by typical methods of destruction. From here eastward, the road is being repaired and the train can no longer go forward. In the light of the setting sun, looking eastward, one can only see a scene of destruction and chaos among the undulating sand dunes.
    Of course, the British and French aggressors bear the same responsibility for these crimes of the Israeli aggressors, because Israel launched the aggression under the instigation of Britain and France. Moreover, if the British and French aggressors had not launched an offensive in the Suez Canal area, forcing the Egyptian army to withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula, the Israeli army would not have been able to advance so far. The facts have once again proven that the threat to peace and security in Egypt and all Middle Eastern countries comes from those imperialist countries that attempt to continue to enslave the people of the Middle East.
    But, ironically, just as we were witnessing the acts of aggression of Britain, France, and Israel in the Sinai Peninsula, U.S. President Eisenhower was clamoring in Congress about the threat of communism to the Middle East, threatening to use force to deal with the so-called communist aggression against the Middle East. But, Mr. Eisenhower, where were you when the armies of Britain, France, and Israel were occupying Egyptian territory, killing Egyptian civilians and prisoners of war? Put away your hypocritical rhetoric. The people of Egypt and the Middle East clearly know what poison is contained in the pill that you wrap in a sugary coat. (December 7th)

    以色列侵略者的暴行
    本报记者　蒋元椿
    1月5日，一批埃及的和外国的记者访问了西奈半岛的北部，亲眼看到了以色列侵略者在那里所造成的惊人的破坏，和他们残杀无辜的平民和战俘的罪行。
    在伊士美利亚，从一座浮桥上渡过苏伊士运河以后，我们就进入了西奈半岛。极目东望，一片荒凉的沙漠，南面有些不高的沙岗蜿蜒起伏。中午的阳光投射在沙漠上，耀得人眼花。我们的车辆沿着运河东岸的一条沙漠公路，向塞得港的方向前进。不久以后，就到了东堪他拉。此地离伊士美利亚和塞得港距离大致相等，同运河西岸的西堪他拉遥遥相对，目前有浮桥可通。西堪他拉地方很小，东堪他拉比较大，除了海关、运河公司的一些建筑以外，还有一个阿拉伯区，是本地人聚居的地方。这里有一个大铁路车站。由开罗来的火车经过南面不远处的费丹桥，再经过这里通往巴勒斯坦。
    人们把我们领到东堪他拉市镇南面的一块墓地上。在一个围有铁丝网的坟场里，有许多用砖砌成埋在沙地中的墓穴，有的已经掩上土，有的还没有掩土，只在墓穴上盖了一张旧的绉纹洋铁板。掩埋工人和士兵们正在四周忙碌着。迎风吹来一阵阵尸体腐烂以后的臭味。一位埃及军官告诉我们，这里掩埋的都是被以色列侵略者在西奈半岛上野蛮地杀害的埃及平民和军人的尸体。从去年12月14日开始，到1月4日为止，这里已经掩埋了八十二具这样的尸体。这些尸体大部分有受过残酷折磨的痕迹。
    有一具正在掩埋的尸体，是一位埃及军官。人们在离堪他拉十四公里的路边上发现了它。尸体已经腐烂，可以看出是被割断头颈以后死去的。现在尸骨已经乱成一堆。另外一具女尸，是从离堪他拉四十二公里铁路线上的罗曼那车站运来的。以色列军队在那里把三十八名平民关在车站上的一间屋子里，然后在四周安设地雷，炸毁了这间房子。这个女人就是死难者之一。
    据一位埃及准将在伊士美利亚告诉我们说，在铁路线南面一个名为“英所其”的地方，还发现了七十六名埃及士兵的尸体。他们是在被俘以后，被以色列军队用电线反缚双手，然后用电线勒死的。
    我们在堪他拉车站登上一列挂有三个车厢的专车，向东驶去。这条通往巴勒斯坦的铁路，从离堪他拉不远处开始，几乎完全遭到以色列军队的破坏。现在已经修复了六十公里，我们的列车就在这条修复不久的线路上行驶。在铁路南面不远的地方，就是一条柏油公路。这条公路也遭到了破坏，现在只修复了一部分。
    以色列军队用各种恶毒的办法破坏铁路和公路。他们用推土机把路轨下面的枕木掘起来，然后仍然用推土机左右冲撞路轨，使路轨弯曲断裂。这种办法特别使用于股道较多的车站。在路线上，他们用炸药把两节钢轨衔接的地方炸开一个四、五十公分宽的缺口，一路上都是如此，使得修复工作特别困难。
    铁路沿线的车站，全部被炸成平地。埃及方面已经在进行抢修。新的站房的墙壁，在有几个小站上已经砌好。沿路的电话线，也全部遭到破坏。每一根电线杆，不论是木质的还是铁质的，都被用炸药在离地面大约一公尺处炸断，电话线散了一地。埃及工兵部队现在正在抢修，有二十多公里的新电话线已经架好。他们利用被炸斜的原有的电线杆子，把它们插在沙里，争取尽可能早地修复线路。
    公路被破坏得尤其厉害。这条铺有将近五、六公分厚的沥青路面的公路，被用装上刀刃的推土机全部翻掘了一遍，弄得体无完肤，望去只是一片黑色的七上八下的土块，你会以为这是翻耕过的田地，决不会想到这曾经是很好的公路。在离堪他拉三站路的地方，在一个名叫基尔·巴那的小站附近，一队修路工人正在紧张地修路。沥青桶沿路堆积如山。路旁是工人们住的帐篷。一台强有力的烧煮沥青、拌和沙土的机器正在隆隆开动。工人们把就地取得的沙土跑步送进机器的漏斗里去。人们正在争取尽早地恢复敌人所造成的破坏。
    西奈半岛是一个很荒凉的地方。从火车上望去，只见沙漠连着沙漠。在铁路和公路两侧的沙土上，纵横着无数条汽车轮胎的印迹，大概是以色列军队撤退和联合国紧急部队前进时留下的。有的地方，散布着一片碎纸屑。还可以看到一两只钢盔，在矮小的柽柳树边仰天放着。路边上有时可以看到掩埋死者的坟墓，用一段烧焦了的木头竖立在坟头上作为标帜。
    一个多小时以后，我们到了罗曼那车站。这里有一片卑湿的沼地，形成了一个小小的绿洲。在沙漠上出现了唧唧叫着的鸟雀，和枝叶纷披的枣椰树。罗曼那车站是个比较大的车站，建筑全部被毁。我们看了有三十八个平民被炸死的地方。在瓦砾堆中，还散乱着衣服、头发，石块上还有血迹，尸臭扑鼻。在附近另一所被炸毁的房子那里，也有强烈的尸臭，但是这里还没有进行发掘。从破坏的情形来看，这所房屋也是被从房子外面用地雷或炸药破坏的。因为落在瓦砾堆上的天花板相当完整。这说明它是在墙壁首先倒塌以后才落下的。否则，在任何情况下，首先遭到破坏的应当是天花板而不是砖石砌成的墙壁。
    在水井旁边，一位穿阿拉伯服装的平民告诉记者们说，他是从东面的厄尔·阿里希城逃出来的。以色列军队目前还占领着这个城。据他说，以色列军队正在那里大肆抢劫和杀害平民。
    罗曼那车站上的一列高边货车，被以色列军队用推土机推翻到了一边，许多车轮被撞裂。车站的股道，也被用典型的破坏方法，弄得歪歪扭扭，四分五裂。由此往东，道路正在修复，列车不能再往前去。在西落的夕阳照耀之下，往东望去，起伏的沙丘之间只见一片破坏纷乱的景象。
    当然，对于以色列侵略者的这种罪行，英、法侵略者是要负同样的责任的，因为，以色列是在英、法教唆下发动侵略的。而且，如果不是英、法侵略者在苏伊士运河区发动进攻，使得埃及军队不得不从西奈半岛撤退的话，以色列军队根本不可能前进得这样远。事实又一次证明了：对于埃及和一切中东国家的和平和安全的威胁，来自那些企图继续奴役中东人民的帝国主义国家。
    可是，带有讽刺意味的是，正当我们在西奈半岛亲眼看到英、法，以色列的侵略罪行的时候，美国总统艾森豪威尔却在国会里大叫大嚷什么共产主义对中东的威胁，扬言要用武力来对付所谓共产主义对中东的侵略。可是，艾森豪威尔先生，当英、法、以色列的军队在侵占埃及土地、杀害埃及的平民和战俘的时候，你又在哪里呢？收起你那一套假仁假义的漂亮话吧。埃及和中东的人民清楚地知道你那颗包着蜜糖外衣的丸药里面装的是什么毒药。　　　　　（十二月七日）
