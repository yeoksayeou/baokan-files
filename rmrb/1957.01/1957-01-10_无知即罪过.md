    Ignorance is a Sin
    Meng Yu
    According to reports: In order to build a road, Longquan County, Zhejiang Province, actually demolished the Jinsha Temple Pagoda of the Five Dynasties and the Chongyin Temple Twin Pagodas of the Northern Song Dynasty, using the pagoda bricks of the three pagodas to pave the road surface. The Tang and Song Dynasty scriptures and colored paintings in the stone coffins inside the pagodas were burned, and small silver pagodas and gilded ancient coins were destroyed and melted.
    If we were fortunate enough to obtain a brick from a thousand-year-old pagoda (like the bricks of the Leifeng Pagoda in Hangzhou from the same period), we would surely dance with joy, enshrine it, and regard it as a treasure. But the Civil Affairs Section of Longquan County was truly generous, not only demolishing the ancient pagodas without any reluctance, but also smashing a large number of pagoda bricks to pave the road.
    The discovery of the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang shocked the world. This rare treasure aroused the covetousness of many imperialist adventurers, who tried every possible means to plunder a large number of cultural relics. The crimes of Stein, Pelliot, and Warner are still infuriating today. If we occasionally find a lost page of a fragment or a damaged painting, we will also regard it as a priceless treasure. However, some cadres in Longquan County openly regarded two boxes and more than one hundred volumes of Tang and Song Dynasty scriptures, woodcut scriptures, and colored Buddhist paintings, which are estimated to be of the same value as the Dunhuang art, as superstitious items, and burned these “national treasures” as if imitating Lin Zexu's hatred of opium. The one who struck this match was truly brave!
    If we insist that they intentionally destroyed "national treasures" and deliberately committed crimes, not only would they feel wronged, but I would also speak out for them. Because demolishing the pagodas to build roads was nothing more than an idea of "waste utilization"; burning scriptures was probably also for the purpose of "eliminating superstition." It's just a pity that we are not purely motivation-based thinkers; we must also look at the effects. Within the small circle of cultural relics, how many similar cases of unintentional damage to rare treasures are there!
    As the saying goes, "Knowledge is power," and "Ignorance is a sin." To do good deeds, one must have knowledge, and don't use "lack of culture" as a shield anymore.

    无知即罪过
    孟予
    报载：浙江省龙泉县为了修马路，竟将五代的金沙寺塔、北宋的崇因寺双塔拆除，利用三塔的塔砖铺砌路面。塔内石函中的唐宋写经、彩色画像付之一炬，小银塔、鎏金古钱等销毁溶化了。
    对千年古塔，要是我们有幸得到一块砖（如同期的杭州雷峰塔砖），势必手舞足蹈，供之奉之，视如珍宝。但龙泉县的民政科真是慷慨大方，毫无吝色地拆除古塔还不算，竟将大量塔砖击碎铺路。
    敦煌千佛洞的发现，惊动全球，这一稀世奇珍，引起多少帝国主义冒险家的觊觎，千方百计地劫走大批文物。史坦因、伯希和以及华尔纳的罪行，今天想起来都令人切齿。我们如果偶尔发现散失在外的一页残卷、一幅残画，亦必视同连城之璧。但是，龙泉县竟有干部公然把两箱又一百多卷和敦煌艺术品有同样估计价值的唐、宋写经、木刻经卷及彩色佛像画当作迷信品，像似效法林则徐仇视鸦片一样，把“国宝”付之一炬。划这一根火柴者，真乃好不勇敢！
    如果硬说他们有意毁坏“国宝”，存心犯罪，那是不但他们抱屈，我也要为他们呼冤的。因为毁塔修路，无非起念于“废物利用”；焚烧经卷，大约也是为了“破除迷信”。只可惜我们不是唯动机论者，更要看的是效果。就在文物这一个小圈圈里，像这样由于无意中损毁稀世奇珍的有多少！
    常言说得好，“知识即力量”，“无知即罪过”。要做好事就得要有知识，莫再把“没有文化”当作挡箭牌。
