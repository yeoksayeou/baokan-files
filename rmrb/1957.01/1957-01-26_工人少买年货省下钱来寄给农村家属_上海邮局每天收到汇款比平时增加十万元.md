Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 25th: Shanghai workers are remitting their surplus money to their rural families to celebrate the Spring Festival. In recent days, the Shanghai post offices have been receiving approximately 100,000 yuan more per day in remittances from workers to rural areas than usual.

Recently, secretaries of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the vice mayor, and responsible cadres from various agencies have gone deep into the grassroots, giving reports to factory and enterprise workers on strengthening the worker-peasant alliance and practicing frugality during the Spring Festival. The workers have also held symposiums and discussions. Many workers have decided to buy fewer New Year's goods and celebrate the Spring Festival in a simple and frugal manner. Some workers originally planned to return to their hometowns for the Spring Festival, but after careful consideration, they decided not to go and instead sent the saved travel expenses to their families. Many workers residing in Caoyang New Village are from areas in northern Jiangsu and Anhui that suffered severe disasters last year. The post office in this new village has been receiving more than ten remittances from them every day recently.

    工人少买年货省下钱来寄给农村家属
    上海邮局每天收到汇款比平时增加十万元
    新华社上海25日电　上海工人把余钱寄给农村家属欢度春节。这几天，上海的邮局每天收到职工寄给农村的汇款比平时增加十万元左右。
    近些日子，中共上海市委员会书记处书记、副市长及各机关负责干部都深入基层，向工厂、企业职工作了加强工农联盟、俭朴过春节的报告，工人们又举行了座谈和讨论。许多职工决定少买年货，简单朴素过春节。有的工人本来准备回乡过春节，算过细账以后决定不回去了，并把节省下来的路费寄给家属。居住在曹阳新村的许多工人老家是在江苏和安徽北部等去年受灾严重的地区，设在这个新村的邮局最近以来每天都要收到他们十多笔汇款。
