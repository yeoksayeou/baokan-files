Xinhua News Agency, January 18th – China's inland river and maritime shipping industries have developed in the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan. Inland river and coastal shipping enterprises have been adding tens of thousands of tons of newly built ships every year. The newly added ships in the past four years are equivalent to the total tonnage of ships at the beginning of the nationwide liberation of the mainland in 1949. The newly added ship deadweight tonnage last year reached more than 100,000 tons.

In the past four years, many new ports have been built, and the annual handling capacity has increased by several million tons every year. The newly built port handling capacity last year reached 3.7 million tons.

Currently, the national shipping department is continuing to carry out the capital construction tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan and is starting to plan the technical transformation of existing ships, ports, and ship repair factories to gradually adapt water transportation equipment to the ever-increasing transportation needs. New ship types and ship machinery power are also being studied.

    四年的建设
    新华社18日讯　我国内河和海上航运事业在第一个五年计划前四年内有了发展。内河和沿海航运企业每年都增加好几万吨的新建船舶。四年内新增加的船舶已经相等于1949年全国大陆解放初期的船舶总吨位。去年新增的船舶载重吨位即达十万多吨。
    四年内新建了不少港口，每年都增加好几百万吨的年吞吐能力。去年新建的港口吞吐能力即达三百七十万吨。
    目前全国航运部门正在继续进行第一个五年计划所规定的基本建设任务，并着手进行对原有船舶、港口、修船工厂技术改造的规划，将使水路运输设备逐渐适应日益增长的运输需要。新的船型和船舶机械动力也正在研究中。
