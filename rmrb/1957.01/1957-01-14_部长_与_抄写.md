    "Minister" and "Copying"
    Xie Juezai
    In the People's Daily article "Changing the Phenomenon of Top-Heaviness" on December 10th of last year, there were these sentences: In Anda County, Heilongjiang Province, "the county Party committee's organization department has only seven staff members in total, but four of them are ministers. Once, there was an urgent document that needed to be copied, but all three staff members happened to be out. The four ministers, because they were all leading cadres in the department, were unwilling to do the specific copying work."
    What's strange is, of course, "out of seven staff members, four are ministers," too many officers and too few soldiers; but what's even stranger is that "the four ministers, because they were all leading cadres in the department, were unwilling to do the specific copying work."
    Promoting a person to a leadership position is certainly not for "copying"; but there is also no regulation or custom that says a leading cadre "copying" themselves would be a loss of status, and a loss of status would mean "dereliction of duty."
    I can't help but think of a story: Once, there was an official's wife who went to see the empress. The empress shook her hand, and after that, that hand became a "royal hand," unable to hold things or do work. That official's wife's hand was originally healthy, but it was crippled by the empress's handshake; these four ministers' hands were also healthy, but after becoming "ministers," they couldn't "write" anymore. How harmful it is to be promoted!
    I hope that these four ministers don't think this way, and that it's just an occasional morbid state of "top-heaviness to the point of dizziness" in which cadres are piled up in upper-level agencies.
    A "leading cadre" is called "leading" because he can take responsibility and do more work. Of course, he can direct others to do things, and he should direct others to do things, but not because he disdains to do it himself, but because he can't manage to do it all. Sometimes, even if others can do it, he wants to check because he's not reassured, or take it over and do it himself. For example, when drafting important documents, if he estimates that the staff members haven't grasped the whole picture and can't write well, he has to do it himself, or explain the content clearly to the person writing it, asking them to write a first draft, and then revise it himself; no matter how much revision is done, it's always less effort than drafting from scratch.
    Drafts and revised manuscripts need to be copied, which is also called transcription; if there are too many corrections, and others can't see clearly, then you have to copy it yourself.
    "Copying" or "typing" is an important process in handling documents. The purpose of writing documents is to explain work to other agencies or personnel, to let them know what the matter is and how they should do it. One wrong word, one missing word, or something blurry and unclear can often render the document useless, or even cause trouble. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the proofreading of documents; for important documents, leaders must personally proofread them.
    Whether copying with a brush or a pen, you must write in regular script, with clear strokes, and write larger so that people can read it without difficulty. Some writers write some characters very high and some very short, looking like rows of pagodas; or connect the front and back characters together, often causing people to misunderstand the right side of the previous character and the left side of the next character as one character; and some people create some unique brushstrokes of their own.
    This is worse than what Chairman Mao once criticized, writing the second stroke of the worker's "工" character not straight but turning two corners, writing it as "?"; and adding three strokes to the right foot of the person's "人" character, writing it as "?", "vowing not to let the common people see it." Perhaps some people will say: You are too stubborn, isn't Chinese character reform underway? I say: I am in favor of Chinese character reform; but can you guarantee that the people who read your writing are at the same level of "reform" as you? If not, then your document will become waste paper in front of people who don't understand your writing.
    There are documents as numerous as the hairs on an ox, and leading cadres can't possibly read them all, so how can they manage "copying"? But that is a matter of eliminating bureaucracy. As for important documents, leading cadres must do it themselves (including brainstorming, drafting, or revising), even copying.
    But then again: "You are also a minister, do you still copy things yourself now?" The answer must be honest: I haven't done copying work myself for a long time. But I always do the final proofreading of things I write myself, fearing that there will be printing errors, misspelled words, and punctuation errors. I'm never at ease unless I take a look. And I can find places that are not written properly and modify them during proofreading.

### “部长”与“抄写”

    “部长”与“抄写”
    谢觉哉
    去年12月10日人民日报“改变头重脚轻的现象”文中有这么几句：黑龙江省安达县“县委组织部一共只有七个工作人员，就有四个部长。有一次要抄写一份急用的材料，恰好三个干事都不在家，四个部长因为都是部里的领导干部，谁也不愿意做这个具体的抄写工作。”
    奇怪的固然是“七个工作人员中，就有四个部长”，官多兵少；但更奇怪的，是“四个部长因为都是部里的领导干部，谁也不愿意做这个具体的抄写工作”。
    把一个人提拔到领导地位，绝不是为着“抄写”；但也没有任何规定或习惯，说领导干部自己“抄写”是失了身份，失了身份就意味着“失职”。
    不能不使我想起一个故事：从前有个官太太，朝见皇后，皇后握了她的手，以后这只手就成了“御手”，不能拿东西、做事。那位官太太的手本来是健全的，被皇后一握，残废了；这四位部长的手也是健全的，做了“部长”就不能“写字”了。甚矣哉被提升之害人也！
    我希望这四位部长的想法并不是这样，而只是把干部堆积到上级机关里的一种“头重到发昏”的偶然病态。
    “领导干部”之所以称为“领导”，在于他能负责、能多做事。当然他可以指使别人做，也应该指使别人做，但不是自己不屑做而是做不嬴。有时即使别人可以做的事而因为不放心，要去检查，或者拿过来自己做。比如重要文件的起草，估计干事们没有掌握全盘，不能写好的，就得自己动手，或者把内容向写的人交代清楚，要他写个初稿出来，自己再来修改；修改不论改多少，总比起草省力。
    起草和修改的稿件，要人抄写，也叫誊清；假如涂改得太多，别人看不清楚的，那就只有自己动手抄写。
      “抄写”或“打印”，是办理文件一个重要过程。写文件的目的，是向别的机关或别的人员交代工作，要他们知道是什么事，应该怎样做。错一个字，遗落一个字，或模糊看不清楚，常常使文件失去作用，甚至出乱子。所以必须要重视文件的校对；重要文件，领导人须要亲自校对。
    抄写，不论用毛笔或钢笔，都要写正楷，笔画分明，要写得大一些，使人看起来不费力。有些写字的人，把字有的写得很高有的写的很矮，看去像一排排的宝塔；或者前后字联在一起，常使人误会前一个字的右边和后一个字的左边是一个字；还有人创造一些他个人独有的笔法。
    这比毛主席曾经批判过的把工人的“工”字第二笔不是写的一直而是转了两个弯子，写成了“?”字；人字呢，在右边脚上加了三撇写成了“?”字，“是发誓不要老百姓看”，还要糟糕。也许有人要说：你太顽固了，汉字不正在改革吗？我说：汉字改革我是赞成的；但你敢保证看你写的字的人，都和你的“改革”的程度一样吗？如不一样，那你的文件在看不懂你的写法的人的面前就成为废纸。
    文件多如牛毛，领导干部不可能都看，那能管得上“抄写”？但那是清除文牍主义方面的事。至于重要文件，领导干部必须自己动手（包括出主意、起草或修改）甚至抄写。
    话得说回来：“你也是个部长，你现在还自己抄写吗？”回答要老实：我好久不自己做抄写工作了。但自己写的东西，自己总要做最后的校对，怕印错、写错字及标点符号。不看看总不放心。而且可以在校对时发现写得不妥当之处加以修改。
