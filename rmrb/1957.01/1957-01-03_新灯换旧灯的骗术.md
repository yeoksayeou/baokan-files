    The Trick of Trading New Lamps for Old

    The wares of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" have just been peddled, and the market reaction is not good. The Middle Eastern people's discernment is particularly sharp. A Cairo resident pinpointed that this "doctrine" is trying "to sell new lamps to the Arabs in place of old lamps."

    The Arab people are very familiar with the story of the "magic lamp" in "Arabian Nights." Aladdin obtained the magic lamp through his own efforts, which enabled him to obtain countless properties and marry the Sultan's daughter. Aladdin's achievements infuriated the ambitious and vicious sorcerer. The sorcerer hired an unskilled coppersmith to make new lamps and shouted along the way, "New lamps for old lamps," to trick Aladdin's magic lamp. Unfortunately, Aladdin's wife fell for the sorcerer's trick. However, this has become a lesson passed down from generation to generation by the Arab people.

    Like that insidious and cunning sorcerer pretending to be Aladdin's relative, the American colonialists are also trying their best to dress up as the "loyal friends" and "protectors" of the Arab people. In order to achieve the goal of ruling the Middle East, they are very angry at the Arab people's recent anti-colonialist victories and are determined to use the colonialist "new lamp" of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to exchange for the Arab people's "magic lamp" of defending independence, and like that sorcerer, plan to immediately destroy the happiness of the "magic lamp's" owner. Now, they are loudly hawking the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

    When Washington officials peddle the "Eisenhower Doctrine," they proclaim that "the main purpose of this new doctrine is to protect the entire region from Russian erosion," and to "install a protective shield in the Middle East threatened by communism with American power." However, because playing the role of Middle East protector is so incongruous for American colonialists, their true colors are immediately seen through. Cairo residents powerfully replied to them: "The Arabs drove the British and French out the door not to let the Americans in through the window."

    Even in the United States, bourgeois commentator Lippmann is worried that the appearance of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" will inevitably expose the so-called hypocrisy of sympathizing with Arab neutralism. The newspaper of the British big boss who suffered in the Middle East also clearly knows that this American "doctrine" is to replace the colonial rule of Britain and France in the Middle East. Therefore, "The Times" said that this is an irony of the hypocritical attitude the United States had previously taken.

    The American "sorcerers" had better put away their "new lamps." Because the awakened Arab people will no longer be as easily deceived as Aladdin's wife.

### 新灯换旧灯的骗术

    新灯换旧灯的骗术
    “艾森豪威尔主义”的货色还刚刚兜售，市场反应就不美妙。中东人民的鉴别力特别锐敏。一位开罗人士一针见血地道破，这个
  “主义”是想“设法向阿拉伯人兜售新灯以代替旧灯”。
    阿拉伯民间非常熟悉“天方夜谈”中关于“神灯”的故事。阿拉丁靠自己力量取到了神灯，使他得到无数的财产，还娶了苏丹的女儿。阿拉丁的成就，使野心勃勃而凶恶的法师气极了。法师雇了并不高明的铜匠做了新灯，沿途叫喊：“新灯换旧灯”，来骗取阿拉丁的神灯。不幸，阿拉丁的妻子上了法师的当。但是，这已成了阿拉伯人民一个世代相传的教训。
    和那个阴险而狡猾的法师假装是阿拉丁的亲人一样，美国殖民主义者也极力装扮成为阿拉伯人民的“忠实朋友”和“保护者”。他们为了达到统治中东的目的，对阿拉伯人民最近反殖民主义的胜利非常恼怒，一心想用“艾森豪威尔主义”这个殖民主义的“新灯”，来换取阿拉伯人民保卫独立的“神灯”，并且像那个法师一样，打算马上把“神灯”的主人的幸福一下毁掉。现在，他们高声叫卖“艾森豪威尔主义”。
    华盛顿的官员在兜售“艾森豪威尔主义”的时候，宣扬说：“这一新主义的主要的宗旨是保护整个区域，使之免受俄国的侵蚀”，是要“以美国的力量给受到共产主义威胁的中东安上一面保护的盾牌”。但是，因为扮演中东保护人的角色对美国殖民主义者是如此的不相衬，他们的真面目马上就被人识破了。开罗人士有力地回答他们说：“阿拉伯人在把英法赶到门外并不是为了让美国从窗户进来。”
    甚至在美国，资产阶级的评论家李普曼也担心“艾森豪威尔主义”的出场，难免要把所谓同情阿拉伯中立主义的虚伪说法揭穿了。在中东倒了霉的英国大老板的报纸，也很清楚美国这个“主义”就是要取代英法在中东的殖民统治。因此“泰晤士报”说，这是对美国前一时期所作的伪善姿态的一种讽刺。
    美国的“法师”最好还是收起他们的“新灯”吧。因为，已经觉醒的阿拉伯人民不会再像阿拉丁的妻子那样容易受骗了。
