Xinhua News Agency, Taldin, January 5th: The inaugural flight on the new air route from Beijing to Taldin in the Qaidam Basin safely landed at Taldin Airport, 2,911 meters above sea level, at noon on the 5th.

　　This flight departed from the western suburban airport of the capital on the morning of the 4th. En route, the plane landed at intermediate stops in Baotou, Lanzhou, and Xining, and stayed overnight in Xining. Due to the good weather, the plane flew smoothly in the boundless clear sky. From Xining to Taldin, the plane flew over Qinghai Lake, China's largest inland saltwater lake, in 21 minutes. At this time, the plane's speed was 300 kilometers per hour, and the altitude was 4,300 meters. When the plane flew over the Qaidam Basin, the countless snow-covered, crystal-clear peaks to the north and south of the basin were a magnificent sight from the plane.

　　The Beijing-Taldin route is 2,287 kilometers long, and the total flight time was eight hours and eleven minutes.

　　When this flight landed at Xining Airport on the afternoon of the 4th, it was warmly welcomed by people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province. A ceremony attended by more than 2,000 people was held at Xining Airport to celebrate the opening of the Beijing-Taldin air route. Leading personnel from Qinghai Province and Xining City, as well as representatives from the Civil Aviation Administration, spoke at the meeting, congratulating the opening of this air transportation line connecting the capital and Qinghai Province.

　　Taldin is located in the western part of the Qaidam Basin, 148 kilometers away from the Mangya, the oil exploration base in the basin. After geological surveys and drilling, the Qaidam Basin has been proven to contain not only a large amount of oil, but also other mineral deposits. After the opening of this air route, it will make it more convenient for geological exploration personnel in the basin and the people of Qinghai Province to connect with the capital and other parts of the country; the transportation of various equipment, medicines, and mail urgently needed for geological exploration will also be more convenient.

    北京——塔尔丁新航线正式通航
    据新华社塔尔丁5日电　从北京通往柴达木盆地塔尔丁的新航线的首次班机，5日中午在拔海二千九百十一公尺的塔尔丁机场安全降落。
    这架班机是在4日早晨从首都西郊机场起飞的。途中，飞机曾在中途站包头、兰州和西宁降落，并且在西宁过夜。由于天气很好，飞机一直是在一望无际的晴空中平稳飞行。从西宁到塔尔丁，飞机以二十一分钟的时间飞过我国最大的内陆咸水湖——青海湖。这时，飞机飞行速度是每小时三百公里，高度是四千三百公尺。当飞机飞临柴达木盆地的上空，从飞机上了望盆地南北无数积雪的晶莹耀眼的山峰，景色十分壮丽。
    北京——塔尔丁航线全长二千二百八十七公里，飞机总共飞行了八小时又十一分钟。
    这架班机4日下午在西宁机场降落的时候，受到青海省各族各界人民的热烈欢迎。在西宁机场上举行了一个有二千多人参加的北京——塔尔丁航线通航典礼大会。青海省和西宁市的领导人员和民航局的代表都在会上讲话，祝贺这条连接首都和青海省的空中交通线的通航。
    塔尔丁在柴达木盆地的西部，距盆地石油勘探基地——茫崖一百四十八公里。柴达木盆地经过地质普查和钻探，证实不仅有大量的石油，而且还有其他矿藏。这条航线通航以后，将使盆地的地质勘探人员和青海省人民，同首都以及祖国各地的联系更加方便；地质勘探急需的各种器材、医药用品和邮件报刊的传送，也更加便捷。
