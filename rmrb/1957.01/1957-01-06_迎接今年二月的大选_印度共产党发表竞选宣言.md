Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 5th: The latest issue of "New Age" weekly published the election manifesto of the Indian Communist Party. The Indian general election will be held in late February this year.

The manifesto begins by stating that in the ten years since achieving freedom, the people of India had hoped that the government would use political freedom as a tool to achieve social and economic freedom and improve the people's culture. But the experience of the years since independence has shattered their hopes.

Referring to the lessons of the last election, the manifesto said that in the first general election of the Republic of India (1952), the Congress Party received only 42% of the total votes, and several prominent Congress leaders, including several ministers, were defeated. Candidates from various parties confronting the Congress Party and proposing more radical programs received 25% of the vote. The Communist Party, which the government had tried to undermine, became a powerful force.

The manifesto added that due to the undemocratic election system implemented domestically, the Congress Party remained in power, holding far more seats than it should have been allocated based on the votes it received.

In the section "The Old Situation Remains Unchanged," the manifesto pointed out that Britain's dominant position in many important sectors of the Indian economy has not been eliminated, or even seriously shaken, as guaranteed during the independence struggle.

"Our coal and manganese mines, our jute industry, our plantations, our foreign trade—all this and many other sectors are still in the hands of British capital and remain a source of their huge profits, which must be used if the task of national construction is to be completed rapidly."

The manifesto said that India's heavy and basic industries are still in their infancy, and the public sector is not only still very weak, but the companies it includes are inefficient. Agriculture remains primitive, poverty is widespread throughout the country, and the proportion of unemployed people in urban and rural areas has reached alarming levels.

The manifesto, which is ten thousand words long, emphasizes the need to prioritize the development of heavy and basic industries in the public sector. The manifesto calls for a fundamental change to the Second Five-Year Plan "in accordance with national interests." The manifesto said that the Communist Party will also "fight for the implementation of those recommendations in this plan that are beneficial to the country. It will fight against all attempts by vested interest groups, government authorities, and bureaucrats to undermine these recommendations."

The manifesto guarantees to strengthen the struggle to sever India's relationship with the Commonwealth. It calls for breaking the control of British capital over important sectors of the Indian economy, curbing monopoly capitalists, and rapidly developing the public sector.

In order to obtain resources to rapidly develop the national economy, the manifesto calls for nationalizing banks, general insurance, coal mines, the aluminum industry, manganese, steel, iron, and gold mines, and also nationalizing British-controlled jute factories, tea and coffee plantations.

The manifesto calls for developing weapons, aircraft, and shipbuilding industries in order to strengthen India's security and national independence.

It calls for setting a national minimum wage for the working class and immediately increasing wages by 25%, expanding employment and other opportunities for the middle class, rapidly improving agriculture and giving land to farmers and agricultural laborers, and reducing the burden of taxes.

The manifesto calls for giving women equal rights in all aspects, improving their situation in social, economic, and educational fields. Regarding ethnic minorities, untouchables, and tribal peoples, the manifesto calls for fully protecting their rights, giving regional autonomy to tribal areas, and stopping military operations in the Naga region. It calls for rapidly resettling refugees and providing them with paid work.

The manifesto specifically calls for systematically and comprehensively expanding democracy, guaranteeing civil liberties, abolishing the Preventive Detention Act, and taking effective measures to end the monopoly capitalists' monopoly over Indian newspapers.

The manifesto said that the Indian Communist Party will fight to support the peace aspirations of the Indian people, who advocate peace, advocate friendship with all countries, strengthen relations with Asian and African countries in resurgence and the socialist world, restore China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, withdraw foreign troops from all countries, disarm and ban the use of weapons of mass destruction, end military treaties, liberate the Indian territories occupied by Portugal, and develop friendly relations between India and Pakistan.

The manifesto said that the implementation of the program put forward in this manifesto "will create favorable conditions for the struggle for socialism and to move peacefully towards this goal in accordance with the characteristics of our people and their great democratic traditions."

The Indian Communist Party guarantees to strive for unity between left-wing and democratic parties in order to "ensure that those who bravely defend the people's cause win as many seats as possible." It will strive to establish governments based on the unity of various democratic parties in those states where the democratic movement is particularly strong, based on a common program. At the same time, in other states, it will seek to strengthen the position of itself and other democratic opposition parties.

The manifesto concludes by saying, we believe in the people and their judgment, and we participate in the election struggle with the confidence that the decisions of our people will strengthen the position of the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism in our country.

    迎接今年二月的大选
    印度共产党发表竞选宣言
    新华社新德里5日电　最近一期的“新世纪”周报刊载了印度共产党的竞选宣言。印度大选将在今年2月下旬举行。
    宣言首先说，在取得自由以后的十年中，印度人民曾经期望政府利用政治自由作为实现社会和经济自由以及提高人民文化的工具。但是获得自由以后的几年中的经验已经使他们的希望破灭了。
    宣言在提到上次选举的教训时说，在印度共和国第一次大选时（1952年）国大党只得到总票数的42％，包括几名部长在内的若干著名的国大党领袖都落选了。跟国大党对垒的、提出较为激进的纲领的各党候选人得到了25％的选票。政府曾经竭力要加以破坏的共产党成为强大的力量。
    宣言又说，但是由于在国内实行的不民主的选举制度，国大党仍旧执政和当权，它得到的席位远比根据它得到的票数应当分派到的席位为多。
    宣言在“旧的情况仍旧不变”这一节中指出，英国在印度经济的许多重要部门的统治地位并没有消除，甚至没有严重动摇，像独立斗争期间所保证的那样。
    “我们的煤矿和锰矿、我们的黄麻工业、我们的种植园、我们的对外贸易——这一切以及其他许多部门仍旧在英国资本掌握中，并且仍旧是他们的巨额利润的来源，如果要迅速完成国家建设任务的话，就必须使用这些利润。”
    宣言说，印度的重工业和基本工业仍旧处于草创状态，公营部分不仅仍旧很薄弱，而且它所包括的公司效率很低。农业仍旧很原始，全国各地非常贫困，城市和乡村中失业人口比例都达到惊人的程度。
    这篇长达一万字的宣言强调要求优先发展公营部分的重工业和基本工业。宣言要求“根据国家利益”从根本上改变第二个五年计划。宣言说，共产党同时将“为实施这项计划中那些对国家有利的建议而斗争。它将同既得利益集团、政府当局和官僚主义者破坏这些建议的一切企图作斗争”。
    宣言保证加强为断绝印度同英联邦的关系而进行的斗争。它要求打破英国资本对印度经济重要部门的控制，遏制垄断资本家，并且迅速发展公营部分。
    为了取得资源来迅速发展国民经济，宣言要求把银行、一般保险、煤矿、铝工业、锰、钢、铁和金矿收归国有，同时把英国控制的黄麻工厂、茶和咖啡种植园收归国有。
    宣言要求发展武器、飞机和造船工业，以便加强印度的安全和国家独立。
    它要求规定给工人阶级订出全国性的最低工资和把工资立刻增加25％，扩大中等阶级的就业和其他机会，迅速改善农业和给农民和农业劳工以土地，减少租税的负担。
    宣言要求给妇女以在各方面的平等权利，改善在社会、经济和教育方面的情况。关于少数民族、不可接触者和部落人民，宣言要求充分地保护他们的权利，给部落地区以区域自治，停止在那加地区的军事行动。它要求迅速安置难民，让他们得到有报酬的工作。
    宣言特别要求系统地和从各方面来扩大民主，保证公民自由和废除预防性拘留法，采取有效措施来结束垄断资本家对印度报纸的垄断。
    宣言说，印度共产党将进行斗争来支持印度人民的和平愿望，印度人民拥护和平，主张同一切国家友好，加强同亚非复兴国家以及社会主义世界国家的关系，恢复中国在联合国中的合法席位、从一切国家中撤退外国军队，裁军和禁止使用大规模毁灭性的武器，结束军事条约，解放葡萄牙占领的印度领土，发展印度和巴基斯坦的友好关系。
    宣言说，实现这个宣言提出的纲领“将会为争取社会主义的斗争并根据我国人民的特征和他们的伟大的民主传统和平地朝着这个目的前进，创造有利的条件”。
    印度共产党保证努力争取左翼和民主党派之间的团结，以便“保证那些勇敢地维护人民事业的人们获得尽可能最多的席位”。它将努力争取在那些民主运动特别强大的邦中根据共同纲领建立以各民主党派的联合为基础的政府。同时，在另外一些邦中，它将设法加强它自己和其他民主的反对党的地位。
    宣言最后说，我们相信人民和他们的判断，并且相信我们人民的决定将会加强我们国家中的和平民主和社会主义的力量的地位，我们怀着这种信心来参加选举斗争。
