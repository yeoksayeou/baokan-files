Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, January 1st. The six provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan, whose brown sugar production accounts for 70% of the national total, have decided to promote 27 advanced technical experiences in increasing sugarcane yield and brown sugar production during the current sugar pressing season. The main ones include the experience of "small hoe, low cutting" in increasing sugarcane yield in the Shantou area of Guangdong and Putian County of Fujian, the experience of increasing sugar extraction rate by "adding water for pressing three or four times," and the experience of Fujian Yunxiao County's "boiling sugar ingots with magnetic bowls at the bottom to precipitate impurities" to improve sugar quality.

From December 24th to 30th, 1956, the relevant departments of these six provinces held a brown sugar technical experience exchange meeting in Putian County, Fujian Province. The representatives attending the meeting exchanged technical experiences, and also went to Zhengban Village in Putian County to observe the technical operation performances of several brown sugar workshops pressing and boiling sugar. They studied the management methods of sugar workshops, enhanced their confidence in increasing sugar production, and proposed plans and guarantees for promoting advanced experience to increase sugar production. According to preliminary statistics of the plans proposed by the representatives of Fujian and Guangxi provinces and the Shantou area of Guangdong Province, after these advanced experiences are fully promoted, the sugar production can be increased by 10,550 tons this winter and spring. Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces, because the current sugar pressing season is coming to an end, have proposed plans to promote it in the next sugar pressing season.

    广东、广西等六省决定
    推广先进技术经验增产食糖
    新华社福州1日电　土糖产量占全国总产量70％的福建、广东、广西、浙江、江西、湖南六省，决定在目前这个榨糖季节中，推广二十七项提高甘蔗收获量和增产土糖的先进技术经验。其中主要的有广东汕头专区和福建莆田县等地的
  “小锄低砍”提高甘蔗收获量的经验，“三次或四次加水压榨”提高出糖率的经验，福建云霄县的“煮糖锭底装磁钵沉淀杂质”提高糖的质量的经验等。
    1956年12月24日到30日，这六个省的有关部门在福建省莆田县举行了土糖技术经验交流会。出席会议的代表交流了技术经验，还到莆田县郑坂村实地观摩了几个土糖坊压榨煮糖的技术操作表演，研究了糖坊的经营管理方法，提高了增产食糖的信心，纷纷提出推广先进经验增产食糖的计划和保证。根据福建、广西两省和广东省汕头专区的代表提出的计划初步统计，这三个地区全面推广这些先进经验以后，去冬今春可以增产食糖一万零五百五十吨。浙江、江西和湖南三省因为当前这个榨糖季节快要结束，提出了准备在下一个榨糖季节推广的计划。
