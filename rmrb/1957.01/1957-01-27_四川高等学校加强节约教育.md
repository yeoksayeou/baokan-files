Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 25th: In the past month or so, all higher education institutions in Sichuan Province have been conducting publicity and education on the themes of hard work, plain living, and running schools with diligence and thrift. Many school principals or presidents have given reports, and administrative organizations, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and various democratic parties in the schools have also organized discussion forums. The schools have also successively launched comprehensive inspections to expose wasteful practices, and have formulated various systems and measures to ensure thrift.

    To solve the housing problem, many school leaders have voluntarily given up part of their housing. Professor Jiang Qingfen of Sichuan Medical College gave up her office as a laboratory, and Liu Hongkang, the Dean of Studies of Sichuan University of Finance and Economics, gave up a large room of his original two-story house to newly arrived lecturers and teaching assistants. The schools also built and renovated some straw-roofed, mud-walled houses based on the principle of streamlining and saving, to provide housing for faculty, staff, and students. The cost of these houses was reduced by about half compared to ordinary new bungalows.

    All schools have put forward many rationalization proposals on the premise of ensuring teaching while saving funds for the country. Sichuan University decided to convert the museum and professor's dormitory, which were not started in 1956, into a 5,000-square-meter teaching building, based on the school's specific situation, which ensured the needs of teaching.

    While exposing wasteful phenomena, the schools also introduced model cases of consistently emphasizing increased production and thrift. The catering section of Sichuan University of Finance and Economics came up with many ways to save food last year, saving more than 80,000 jin of grain from January to November alone. Dr. Zhang Zhongyang of Sichuan Medical College, in order to solve the equipment problems for thoracic surgery, found ways to use old instruments and many substitutes to establish a new pulmonary function testing laboratory. This laboratory cost only more than ten yuan, and was praised by teachers and students of the whole school.

    The newly built Chengdu Institute of Radio Engineering, Chengdu College of Geology Exploration, and Chengdu College of Traditional Chinese Medicine have all rationally arranged houses, books, and equipment under relatively economical conditions to ensure teaching. Students of the Physics Department of Sichuan Normal University proposed to build roads themselves in their spare time, which was responded to by students throughout the school. They built roads from the dormitory to the temporary canteen and toilet, and also leveled a basketball court.

    四川高等学校加强节约教育
    新华社成都25日电　最近一个多月来，四川省各个高等学校都进行了艰苦朴素、勤俭办学的宣传教育。许多学校的校长或院长都作了报告，学校中的行政组织、工会、青年团、各民主党派也组织了座谈讨论。各学校还先后展开了全面检查，揭发浪费现象的活动，并且订出了保证节约的各种制度和措施。
    为了解决住房问题，许多学校的领导人自动让出一部分住房。四川医学院江晴芬教授让出自己的办公室作实验室，四川财经学院教务长刘洪康将自己原住的两间楼房让出一大间给新来的讲师和助教住，学校又本着精简节约原则兴建和改建了一些草顶夹壁的房屋供给教职员工和学生居住。这些房屋的造价比一般新建平房降低了一半左右。
    各个学校都在既能保证教学，又为国家节约资金的前提下，提出许多合理化建议。四川大学1956年没有动工修建的博物馆和教授宿舍，根据学校具体情况，决定改建为一幢五千平方公尺的教学楼，这就保证了教学需用。
    各个学校在揭发浪费现象的同时，还介绍了一贯重视增产节约的模范事例。四川财经学院膳食科去年想了许多办法节约粮食，仅1至11月，就节约了粮食八万多斤，四川医学院张仲扬大夫为了解决胸腔外科手术的设备问题，想办法用旧的仪器和许多代用品，建立了肺功新测验室，这个实验室仅花了十多元钱，获得了全校师生们的赞扬。
    新建的成都电讯工程学院、成都地质勘探学院、成都中医学院等都在比较俭朴的情况下，合理地安排房屋、图书设备等来保证教学。四川师范学院物理系学生提出利用课余时间自己修路的建议，得到全校同学的响应，他们自己修好了宿舍通到临时食堂和厕所的道路，还平出了一个篮球场。
