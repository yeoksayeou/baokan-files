A Casual Discussion on "Opera Reform"
	By Yǐ Qún

	In recent months, we have heard a lot of criticism of "opera reform" work, and the term "opera reformer" has almost become a satirical one. Naturally, we should admit that in the past few years, there have indeed been many cases of "forcing" and "rigidly" reforming traditional operas through administrative interference, resulting in bad reforms. Moreover, the criticisms and discussions in recent months have indeed revealed many cases of bad reforms. However, some authors have collected examples of rough opera reforms from various places and derived a conclusion: that "opera reform work is utterly useless" or "opera reform work has left almost no operas to perform in various places." It cannot be denied that this is a way of venting momentary anger and deliberately smearing the faces of "opera reformers." This is like listing some relatively successful dramas (such as "The Butterfly Lovers," "Heavenly Match," "Qin Xianglian," "Fifteen Strings of Cash," etc.) and drawing the conclusion that "opera reform work has achieved great results with no major shortcomings." Both are extremely "one-sided" statements.

	Therefore, any method that starts from a subjective assumption, collects one-sided data, "inducts" a conclusion, and seeks to "concentrate" on negating or affirming something is the most unreliable pseudo-scientific method.

	I also agree that opera reform work cannot rely on administrative methods. Because truly successful "opera reform" work is only possible on the path of pure artistic creation. However, if we therefore say that there is no need for opera reform work in the future, and simply copying the old ways is ideal, that is also a completely unrealistic idea. In fact, even before there were "opera reform" institutions, all living and popular local operas were constantly undergoing old and new reforms, and the artistic life and mass base of these local operas could be said to have been obtained precisely from this. Taking the most familiar veteran Peking Opera actors such as Mei Lanfang and Zhou Xinfang as examples, how many of the dramas they are most loved by audiences today are "ancient" and "untouched"? Their plays, from the script to the performance, have been constantly modified and refined for years, and new plays are constantly being added. And it is precisely for these reasons that their art has gained unparalleled credibility and extremely high evaluation among the masses. Mr. Mei Lanfang himself said that some of his famous plays are almost modified and refined in every performance. Therefore, in our traditional operas, there has never been an unchanging "tradition." Demanding that every play in traditional opera has an unchanging form is precisely the most "crude" fantasy of outsiders. Take the most familiar Peking Opera traditional dramas as an example, such as "Changban Slope," "Ganlu Temple," and "Yutang Chun," all of which have had more than two popular versions in recent decades. The relatively fixed old plays such as "The Drunken Concubine" and "Universe Front" also had many minor modifications in Mr. Mei Lanfang's later performances. This continuous modification and refinement, gradually developing and changing in stage practice, and even the coexistence of two or more performance versions, is a characteristic of traditional opera and is completely in line with the laws of folk art creation. Opposing opera reform is violating the laws of creation and development of opera art.

	The problem is: the facts prove that all successful modifications of traditional operas (including script modifications and performance refinements) are spontaneously carried out by playwrights, directors (traditional opera did not have the title of director in the past, but the main actors assumed this role), and actors, combined with the opinions and requirements of the audience—that is, the creators and the masses jointly modify them, rather than due to any superior's orders. In the past, there were also modifications made due to external forces—the opinions of reactionary officials, theater owners, or some "prominent figures," but those types of modifications would not stand the test of the masses and the test of time, and would immediately return to their original state after the situation changed. This is precisely the excellent tradition and successful experience of the modification work of traditional opera art. Today, we must also inherit this tradition and learn from this experience in our opera reform work.

	Therefore, we must not, because we have discovered the shortcomings of "opera reform" work in the past few years, turn around and advocate the unchanging nature of traditional opera, and oppose opera reform in general; instead, we should absorb past experiences—both successful and failed experiences—and study how to make future opera reform work (actually, opera creation work) better and more in line with the laws of creation and development of folk opera art. Any approach that starts from a subjective assumption, only looks at one side of the facts, and makes hasty conclusions will be divorced from reality, and therefore the least convincing.

	I hope that in the future, opera workers and new literary and art workers can analyze and study, based on the actual experience of past "opera reform" work, with concrete examples: what kind of modification has been successful? Why was it successful? What kind of modification has encountered failure? And why did it fail? And do not just oppose "opera reform" in general—naturally, do not support "opera reform" in general; because all traditional opera arts still need to continue to carry out creative old and new innovations in order to seek better development, this seems to be beyond doubt.

### 漫谈“戏改”

    漫谈“戏改”
    以群
    近几个月来，我们听到了不少对于“戏改”工作的责难，“戏改家”几乎完全成了一个讽刺名词。自然，我们应该承认：在过去的几年间，确实产生过不少以行政干涉的方法“强”改、“硬”改传统戏曲，而把戏改坏的事例。而且，在近几个月来的批评和讨论中，也确实揭发出了不少改坏的事例。然而，有些作者把各地粗暴改戏的事例汇集起来，而导出一个结论：说“戏改工作一无是处”或是“戏改工作使各地几无戏可演”，却不能不说是一种逞一时意气而故意在“戏改”工作者的鼻子上抹灰的说法。这就像列举出一些改得较为成功的剧目（如“梁山伯与祝英台”、“天仙配”、“秦香莲”、“十五贯”等），而得出一个结论，说“戏改工作成绩巨大，没有什么重大缺点”一样，是极为“以偏概全”的说法。
    所以，一切单从一个主观假设的角度，来搜集一面的资料，“归纳”出一条结论，以求“集中”否定或肯定某一种事物的办法，都是最不可靠的假科学的方法。
    我也同意：戏曲改革工作不能依靠行政的方法。因为真正成功的
  “戏改”工作只有在纯粹艺术创作的轨道上才有可能。然而，假使因此就说：今后无需改戏工作，只要按旧照搬即属理想，那也是一种完全脱离实际的想法。事实上，即在未有“戏改”机构之前，一切有生命、有观众的地方戏曲，就没有不是在经常进行着改旧创新的工作的，而且，这些地方戏曲的艺术生命和群众基础也可以说恰恰是由此获得的。即以最为人们所熟悉的梅兰芳、周信芳等先辈京剧演员来说，他们今天最为观众喜爱的剧目，又有几出是“古已有之”，“原封未动”的？他们的戏，从剧本到表演都是穷年累月地在作着不间断的修改和加工工作的，新的剧目也是在不断地增加。而且也正是因为这些理由，他们的艺术才在群众中得到无比的信誉和极高的评价。梅兰芳先生自己就说过：他的一些名剧，几乎每场都在修改和加工之中。所以，在我们的传统戏曲当中，事实上从来就没有一个一成不变的“传统”。要求传统戏曲中的每一出戏都有一个一成不变的定型，恰恰是外行人的最“粗暴”的空想。就拿大家最熟悉的京剧传统剧目来说，如“长板坡”、“甘露寺”、“玉堂春”等在近几十年间就都有两种以上的流行本。比较定型的“贵妃醉酒”、“宇宙锋”等老戏在梅兰芳先生后期的演出中也有不少的小修改。这种不断的修改和加工，在舞台实践中逐步发展变化，乃至有两种以上的演出本同时并存，正是传统戏曲的一个特点，也是完全符合于民间艺术创作规律的。反对改戏，那才是违反戏曲艺术的创作和发展规律的。
    问题是：事实证明凡是成功的传统戏曲的修改（包括剧本的修改和演出上的加工）都是由编剧、导演（传统戏曲中过去没有导演的名义，而由主要演员担当了这项工作）、演员自发地结合着观众的意见和要求来进行的——也就是创作者和群众共同进行修改，而不是由于什么上级的命令。过去也有由迫于外来势力——反动官方、戏院老板或什么
  “闻人”的意见而作的修改，但那类修改必经不起群众的考验和时间的考验，事过境迁，立刻又恢复原状。这正是传统戏曲艺术的修改工作的优良传统和成功经验。今天我们作改戏工作也必须继承这样的传统，学习这样的经验。
    所以，我们决不能由于发现了过去几年来“戏改”工作的缺点，就反过来提倡传统戏曲的一成不变，笼统地反对改戏；而应该吸取过去的经验——成功的和失败的经验，研究如何使今后的改戏工作（实际上就是戏曲创作工作）做得更好，更符合民间戏曲艺术的创作规律和发展规律。一切从某一个主观假设出发，只看一面的事实，而遽下结论的做法，都会是脱离实际的，因而也就是最没有说服力的。
    我希望今后戏曲工作者和新文艺工作者能够根据过去“戏改”工作的实际经验，提出具体的事例来分析和研究：怎样的改法得到了成功？为什么会成功？怎样的改法遭遇了失败？又为什么会失败？而不要只是笼统地反对“戏改”——自然，也不要笼统地拥护“戏改”；因为一切传统戏曲艺术都还需要继续进行创造性的改旧创新工作，以求更好的发展，这似乎是不容怀疑的事。
