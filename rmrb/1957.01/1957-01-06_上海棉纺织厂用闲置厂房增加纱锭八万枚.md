Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai News – Eight cotton textile factories in Shanghai have decided to utilize existing empty factory buildings to expand with a complete set of 80,000 spindles this year. Another six factories have decided to convert their existing 100,000 to 120,000 old-style fine spinning machines into new-style high-draft fine spinning machines.

These projects are the first large-scale expansion and renovation of Shanghai's cotton textile factories since liberation.

The factories expanding this year almost all do not need to build new factory buildings. Therefore, the state investment is only about half of that required for building a new cotton textile factory of the same scale. The expansion time is at most half a year. After these factories complete their expansion, the increased production capacity can produce more than 86,000 pieces of 21-count cotton yarn per year, and all investment can be recovered from profits within half a year.

The factories being renovated first this year are those whose machines are excessively old and inefficient, which has already affected product quality. For example, the 100,000 to 120,000 spindles of fine spinning machines to be renovated are all old machines that can only spin the roving ten to twelve times longer. After these old-style fine spinning machines are renovated into new-style high-draft fine spinning machines, a roving process can be omitted.

During the Anti-Japanese War, many textile factories in Shanghai had their machines dismantled by the Japanese invaders to build guns and artillery, leaving the factory buildings empty. Some factories were built by capitalists in the past, but they did not have the money to install enough machines. According to surveys, if these factory buildings are fully utilized, Shanghai can still add a complete set of equipment for more than 100,000 to 200,000 spindles. In addition, many old factories are in great need of technical transformation and improvement. The Ministry of Textile Industry has decided to establish a textile design institution in Shanghai to specifically be responsible for the design work of expansion, renovation, and technical transformation of Shanghai textile factories.

### 上海棉纺织厂用闲置厂房增加纱锭八万枚

    上海棉纺织厂用闲置厂房增加纱锭八万枚
    据新华社上海讯　上海有八个棉纺织厂决定利用现有的空厂房，在今年内扩建八万枚纱锭的全套设备；还有六个厂决定把现有十万到十二万锭老式精纺机，改为新式的大牵伸精纺机。
    这些工程是解放后上海棉纺织厂第一次大规模的扩建和改建。
    这些决定在今年扩建的工厂几乎全部不需要新建厂房，因此国家投资只大约相当于新建同样规模棉纺织厂的一半，扩建时间最多半年。这些工厂扩建完成以后，增加的生产能力一年可以生产八万六千多件二十一支棉纱，半年内就可以从利润中收回全部投资。
    今年首先改建的工厂，都是因为机器过分陈旧，效率低，已经影响到产品质量的厂。例如决定改装的十万到十二万锭精纺机，就全部是只能把粗纱纺长十倍到十二倍的老机器。把这些老式精纺机改装成新式的大牵伸精纺机以后，就可以省去一道粗纺工序。
    上海许多纺织厂在抗日战争时期，曾经被日本侵略者拆去机器造枪炮，使厂房空了下来；还有一部分厂是过去资本家造好了厂房，没有钱安装足够的机器。据调查，如果充分利用这些厂房，上海还可以增加十多万到二十万枚纱锭的全套设备。另外，还有不少老的工厂也极需从技术上加以改造和提高。纺织工业部已经决定在上海成立纺织设计机构，专门负责上海纺织厂的扩建、改建和技术改造的设计工作。
