Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Dear Comrade Popovkin, Chairman of the Moscow City Soviet: Dear Comrade Bulganin, Dear Comrade Khrushchev, Dear Comrades, Friends:

We are very happy to have this opportunity to meet with representatives of the citizens of the capital of our great ally, the Soviet Union. Meeting with friends is always pleasant. However, meeting with the great Soviet people, our close comrades-in-arms and long-tested good friends, makes us feel particularly happy and excited. Please allow me to first convey the Chinese people's New Year greetings and fraternal greetings to you. I would also like to express, on behalf of all members of our delegation, our deep gratitude to you for your warm welcome and grand reception.

The Chinese people cheer and celebrate the great achievements of Soviet construction and regard the achievements of the Soviet Union as their own.

Nearly two and a half years have passed since my last visit to your great country. In this short period of just over two years, we have seen that under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, the Soviet people have made encouraging achievements in the magnificent cause of communist construction. You have victoriously completed the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. Now you are striving with unparalleled labor enthusiasm and full confidence to realize the Sixth Five-Year Plan. In the past year, you have overfulfilled the annual industrial plan and achieved a bumper harvest in agriculture. The plan to reclaim wasteland, which began in 1954, has also achieved great success. All of this not only demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, but also proves the enormous enthusiasm and creativity that the people can unleash under this system. The Chinese people cheer and celebrate your achievements and regard your achievements as their own. We are deeply convinced that you will unite more closely around your glorious Party and loyal and reliable government, and achieve even greater and more brilliant achievements along the road of victoriously building communism.

The Chinese people fully realize that our construction achievements are inseparable from the support and assistance of the Soviet Union, and that only a socialist country like the Soviet Union, which is loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism and has a strong national power, can give our country such great assistance. The Chinese people will continue, as in the past, to humbly and conscientiously learn from the advanced experience and science and technology of the Soviet Union.

Over the past two years, the Chinese people have also made certain achievements in the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation. We are working hard to implement the last year of the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, and are starting to formulate the Second Five-Year Plan. The cooperativization of agriculture and handicrafts has been basically completed, and capitalist industry and commerce have also achieved overall public-private joint ownership. The people's living standards have improved to some extent, and the socialist enthusiasm of the masses has reached an unprecedented high. In 1956, the total output value of China's industrial production increased by about 25%, and although agricultural production suffered relatively serious natural disasters, output still increased. All of this makes it possible for us to complete and largely overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan this year, thereby laying a foundation for the development of the Second Five-Year Plan.

The Chinese people fully realize that our achievements are inseparable from the support and assistance of the Soviet government and the Soviet people. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union has provided our country with comprehensive and enormous assistance through loans, the supply of equipment and materials, and the dispatch of experts. The 156 major projects that the Soviet Union helped China build constitute the backbone of our country's industrial construction in the First Five-Year Plan. Last year, the Soviet Union increased its assistance to our country by 55 major projects. Only a socialist country like the Soviet Union, which is loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism and has a strong national power, can give our country such comradely and enormous assistance. This generous assistance from the Soviet Union has been of great significance to our country's socialist construction in the past, present and future. I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government and the Soviet people.

The Chinese people also fully realize that our achievements have been achieved along the path of the Great October Revolution. The Soviet Union is the first country in the world to turn scientific socialism from an ideal into a living reality. The Soviet Union's experience in revolution and construction is the best example of creatively applying Marxism based on its own national characteristics. It is precisely because the Soviet Union has provided us with a large amount of advanced experience and valuable lessons that the Chinese people have gained many conveniences and avoided many detours in the revolution and construction. The Chinese people will continue, as in the past, to humbly and conscientiously learn from the Soviet Union, learn from your advanced experience and science and technology. The Chinese people's own experience of struggle has proven that the path of the October Revolution is a broad road leading from victory to victory. There is no force in the world that can make the Chinese people deviate from the path they have chosen.

Comrades! Friends! When I visit the Soviet Union again after nearly two and a half years, we cannot but notice the changes that have taken place in the international situation over the past two years. My last visit to the Soviet Union was precisely at a time when the forces of peace and socialism, after the Korean Armistice, had extinguished another war ignited by colonialism in Indochina. Since then, due to the influence of the peaceful foreign policy pursued by the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and due to the joint efforts of the socialist countries and other peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, the international situation has definitely tended towards relaxation. However, this development is not in line with the wishes of the imperialist aggressive blocs. They blatantly launched a war of aggression against Egypt, and more viciously carried out activities to subvert socialist countries and undermine the unity between socialist countries. All of this has created a certain degree of tension in the current international situation.

In the Hungarian incident, the great Soviet people and the Soviet army once again proved their loyalty to the principles of proletarian internationalism and made great contributions to the cause of peace and socialism.

The unity and strength of the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union is the most important pillar of the cause of world peace and human progress, and also the main obstacle to the aggression and war threats of the imperialist countries. Precisely because of this, the imperialist countries have consistently conspired to subvert socialist countries and tried their best to undermine the unity among socialist countries. The Hungarian incident was an extremely vicious and insidious attack by the imperialist countries on the socialist camp. The imperialists took advantage of the Hungarian people's legitimate dissatisfaction with the serious mistakes made by the Hungarian Party and government in their past work, and instigated counter-revolutionaries to launch riots in an attempt to achieve the restoration of fascism in Hungary, and to open a gap from Hungary to break the unity of the socialist countries. However, the imperialists' wishful thinking was shattered. The Hungarian working people, who adhered to the socialist system, under the leadership of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government and with the assistance of the Soviet army, smashed the conspiracy of the imperialists and counter-revolutionaries. Now, the political situation and economic life in Hungary are gradually returning to normal. This is a major victory for the socialist camp. In this incident, the great Soviet people and the Soviet army once again proved their loyalty to the principles of proletarian internationalism and made great contributions to the cause of peace and socialism.

The imperialists' adventure in Hungary and their aggression against Egypt have suffered serious defeats, but they are not reconciled. This requires the socialist countries and other peace-loving countries and peoples to continue to be vigilant and constantly struggle to smash all the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism.

The counter-revolutionary conspiracy of the imperialists against Hungary was coordinated with their bloody attack on the Egyptian people. They fear the upsurge of the movement of Asian and African countries against colonialism and demanding national independence, and they also fear the growing friendly cooperative relations between socialist countries and many nationally independent countries in Asia and Africa. Therefore, they attempted to contain the socialist countries on the one hand with subversive activities, and on the other hand quickly restore their colonial rule over the Egyptian people by force. However, just as in Hungary, the imperialists' plan of aggression against Egypt also completely miscalculated. Due to the resolute resistance of the Egyptian and Arab peoples, due to the strong condemnation of peace-loving and justice-upholding countries and peoples around the world, and due to the solemn warnings of socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union, Britain, France and Israel had to agree to a ceasefire and withdraw their invading troops from Egypt. The victory of Egypt's resistance to aggression has inspired the struggle of all oppressed nations and dependent countries for independence. And it has proved to them that in carrying out this just struggle, their friends are all over the world, and they can count on the most resolute support and sympathy of the socialist countries.

The imperialists' adventure in Hungary and their aggression against Egypt have both suffered serious defeats. However, this does not mean that the imperialists have reconciled themselves to their defeat. They are still attempting to interfere in Hungary through the United Nations. They are still spreading various deceptive slogans and lies, attempting to provoke narrow national sentiments and undermine the solidarity of socialist countries. At the same time, in the Middle East, the weakening of British and French influence has aroused the US government's greater ambitions for the region. The "Eisenhower Doctrine" recently announced by the United States aims to impose economic and political enslavement on the people of this region, and to carry out military expansion in this region through hostile military blocs, even to the point of armed intervention. All of this requires the socialist countries and other peace-loving countries and peoples in the world to continue to be vigilant and constantly struggle to smash all the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism.

Our socialist countries have been making great efforts to safeguard peace and ease international tensions. The recent proposal of the Soviet government on the issue of disarmament is another major contribution to the cause of peace. We insist on peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, develop diplomatic, economic and cultural relations with each other, and strengthen the exchanges and contacts between the peoples of all countries. We insist on resolving all international disputes through peaceful negotiations, insist on observing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in the relations between countries, and resolutely oppose the preparation for a new world war. Although the imperialist aggressive forces have recently caused a certain degree of tension in the international situation, we believe that through the joint efforts of our socialist countries and other peace-loving forces in the world, the international situation will turn towards relaxation again. The wheels of history cannot be turned back by the imperialist aggressive forces, and the forces of peace will ultimately triumph over the forces of war.

The forces of peace, democracy and socialism have gained a valuable experience in the struggle against imperialism, which is that strengthening the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is an essential and important condition for the socialist cause, or for the national independence movement and the cause of peace in the world.

The forces of peace, democracy, and socialism have just experienced a severe struggle against imperialist aggression. In this struggle, we have achieved an indisputable victory, and at the same time gained a valuable experience, that is, strengthening the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is an indispensable and important condition for our socialist cause, or for the national independence movement and the cause of peace in the world.

Socialist countries are linked together by communist ideals and goals, and the relationship between them must conform to the principles of proletarian internationalism; socialist countries are also independent sovereign states, and the relationship between them must also conform to the Marxist-Leninist principles of national equality. In the past, not everything was normal in the relationship between socialist countries. However, the fraternal unity and mutual assistance between them are clearly more important. Moreover, all problems in the relationship between socialist countries can be resolved through friendly consultation.

On October 30, 1956, the Soviet government issued a declaration on the basis for the development and further strengthening of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. On November 1, 1956, the Chinese government also issued a statement supporting this declaration of the Soviet government. After this, the Soviet Union held talks with Poland, Romania, and the German Democratic Republic respectively, and issued statements. At the beginning of this year, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia held talks and issued a communique. Recently, China has also held talks with the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and Hungary, and has issued or will issue joint communiques and statements. All of this is of extremely important significance for improving the mutual relations between socialist countries, further consolidating the unity of socialist countries, and strengthening the struggle of the people of socialist countries against imperialist aggressive forces. The imperialist aggressive forces know very well that as long as they leave the strong center of the socialist camp, the Soviet Union, other socialist countries can be broken down more easily, so they do everything possible to carry out anti-Soviet agitation. This agitation has suffered a shameful defeat, and will continue to suffer a shameful defeat. We socialist countries are using our firmness in the socialist cause, our firmness in the principles of the unity of socialist countries, to crush the enemy's vicious schemes.

The friendly unity between China and the Soviet Union is an important part of the great unity of socialist countries, and it concerns the most fundamental interests of the eight hundred million people of the two countries. Harming this interest will harm other interests as well.

The friendly unity between China and the Soviet Union is an important part of the great unity of socialist countries. The friendly unity between our two countries concerns the most fundamental interests of the eight hundred million people of our two countries. Harming this interest will inevitably harm other interests as well. Therefore, the Chinese people will continue to strengthen and develop the friendly unity between our two great countries with all our strength. Our unity is built on the basis of the Marxist-Leninist principles of national equality and proletarian internationalism, and therefore is eternal, inseparable, and unbreakable. There is no force in the world that can separate us. All the conspiracies and tricks of the imperialists to undermine the unity between our two countries are destined to fail.

Comrades and friends! I would like to assure you that we must convey the great Soviet people's love for the Chinese people, and the expectations for the Chinese people in the speeches of Comrades Pilyugin, Tsilev, Ryazantseva, and Bulganin today, to the 600 million Chinese people. Encouraged by the Soviet people and Soviet friends, the Chinese people will study better and work harder so as not to disappoint your love and expectations.

Long live the great Soviet people, the most reliable friend of the Chinese people!
Long live the fraternal friendship and great unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union!
Long live the great unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union!
Long live the great unity of the people of the world!
Long live world peace!

### 周恩来总理的讲话

专栏：

    周恩来总理的讲话亲爱的莫斯科市苏维埃主席波布罗夫尼科·夫同志：亲爱的布尔加宁同志，亲爱的赫鲁晓夫同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    我们很高兴能够有这个机会同我们的伟大盟国苏联的首都市民代表们会见。同朋友们会见，在任何时候都是令人愉快的。但是，同伟大的苏联人民、同我们的亲密战友和久经考验的好朋友会见，使我们感到特别愉快和兴奋。请允许我首先转达中国人民对你们的新年祝贺和兄弟般的问候。我也愿意代表我们代表团的全体人员，深深地感谢你们对我们的热情欢迎和隆重接待。
    中国人民为苏联建设的伟大成就欢呼和庆贺，并且把苏联的成就看成和自己的成就一样。
    自从我上次访问你们的伟大国家以来，将近两年半的时间已经过去了。在这短短的两年多的时间内，我们已经看到，苏联人民在苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导下，在宏伟的共产主义建设事业中又取得了令人鼓舞的成就。你们已经胜利地完成了发展国民经济的第五个五年计划。现在你们正在以无比的劳动热情，满怀信心地为实现第六个五年计划而奋斗。在刚刚过去的一年中，你们超额完成了工业的年度计划，获得了农业的大丰收。1954年所开始的开垦荒地的计划，也取得了伟大的成就。这一切不仅显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性，也证明了在这种制度下人民所能发挥的巨大的积极性和创造性。中国人民为你们的这种成就而欢呼和庆贺，并且把你们的成就看成是自己的成就一样。我们深信，你们会更加紧密地团结在你们光荣的党和忠实可靠的政府的周围，沿着胜利地建设共产主义的道路，取得更巨大和更辉煌的成就。
    中国人民充分认识到，我们建设的成就同苏联的支持和援助是分不开的，只有像苏联这样忠实于无产阶级国际主义原则并且具有强大国力的社会主义国家，才能够给予我国这样巨大的援助。中国人民还要像过去一样，继续虚心地认真地学习苏联的先进经验和科学技术。
    两年多以来，中国人民在社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业中，也取得了一定的成绩。我们正在紧张地执行发展国民经济第一个五年计划的最后一年计划，并且正在着手编制第二个五年计划。农业和手工业的合作化已经基本上完成，资本主义工商业也已经实现了全行业的公私合营。人民的生活有了一定程度的改善，群众的社会主义积极性有了空前的高涨。在1956年，我国工业生产的总产值增长了25％左右，农业生产虽然遭到了较严重的天灾，但是产量仍然有所增加。所有这一切，使我们有可能在今年完成和大部分超额完成第一个五年计划，从而为第二个五年计划打下发展的基础。
    中国人民充分地认识到，我们的这些成就是同苏联政府和苏联人民的支持和援助分不开的。自从中华人民共和国成立以来，苏联就通过贷款、供应设备、器材和派遣专家等等方式，给予我国全面的和巨大的援助。苏联帮助我国建设的一百五十六项重大工程，构成了我国第一个五年计划工业建设的骨干。去年苏联又增加援助我国五十五项重大工程。只有像苏联这样忠实于无产阶级国际主义原则并且具有强大国力的社会主义国家，才能够给予我国这样同志式的巨大援助。苏联的这种慷慨援助，无论在过去、现在和将来，对于我国的社会主义建设都是有重大意义的。我愿意趁这个机会，代表中国政府和中国人民，向苏联政府和苏联人民表示衷心的感谢。
    中国人民也同样充分地认识到，我们的成就是沿着伟大十月革命的道路而取得的。苏联是世界上第一个把科学的社会主义由理想变为活生生的现实的国家。苏联的革命和建设的经验是根据自己的民族特点，创造性地运用马克思主义的最好榜样。正是由于苏联给我们提供了大量的先进经验和宝贵教训，才使中国人民在革命和建设中获得了许多便利，少走了许多弯路。中国人民要像在过去一样，继续虚心地和认真地学习苏联，学习你们的先进经验和科学技术。中国人民自己的斗争经验已经证明，十月革命的道路是从胜利走向胜利的康庄大道。世界上没有任何力量能够使中国人民离开他们自己所选择的这条道路。
    同志们！朋友们！当我经过了将近两年半的时间再一次访问苏联的时候，我们不能不注意到两年多以来国际形势所发生的变化。我上一次来苏联访问，正是在和平和社会主义的力量继朝鲜停战以后又在印度支那扑灭了殖民主义所引起的另一场战火的时候。自从那时以后，由于以苏联为首的社会主义国家所奉行的和平外交政策的影响，由于社会主义国家和世界上其他爱好和平的国家和人民的共同努力，国际局势曾经肯定地趋向于和缓。但是，这种发展同帝国主义侵略集团的心愿是不合的。它们公然发动了对埃及的侵略战争，并且更加凶恶地进行颠覆社会主义国家和破坏社会主义国家之间团结的活动。这一切，就造成了目前国际形势的一定程度的紧张。
    伟大的苏联人民和苏联军队在匈牙利事件中，再一次证明了他们对无产阶级国际主义原则的忠诚，并且对和平和社会主义的事业作出了巨大的贡献。
    以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和壮大，是世界和平和人类进步的事业的最重要支柱，也是帝国主义国家进行侵略和战争威胁的主要阻碍。正因为这样，帝国主义国家一贯阴谋颠覆社会主义国家，并且尽量设法破坏社会主义各国之间的团结。匈牙利事件就是帝国主义国家对社会主义阵营的一次极其凶恶阴险的进攻。帝国主义者利用了匈牙利人民对匈牙利的党和政府在过去工作中的严重错误所感到的正当不满，策动反革命分子发动暴乱，企图在匈牙利实现法西斯主义的复辟，企图从匈牙利打开破裂社会主义国家团结的缺口。但是，帝国主义者的妄想破灭了。坚持社会主义制度的匈牙利劳动人民在匈牙利工农革命政府的领导下和苏联军队的援助下，粉碎了帝国主义者和反革命分子的阴谋。现在，匈牙利的政治情况和经济生活正在逐步地恢复正常。这是社会主义营垒的重大胜利。伟大的苏联人民和苏联军队在这次事件中再一次证明了他们对无产阶级国际主义原则的忠诚，并且对和平和社会主义的事业作出了巨大的贡献。
    帝国主义者在匈牙利的冒险和对埃及的侵略已遭到严重失败，但他们并未甘心。这就要求社会主义国家和其他爱好和平的国家和人民继续提高警惕，不断进行斗争，粉碎帝国主义的一切阴谋和诡计。
    帝国主义者对匈牙利进行的反革命阴谋是同他们对埃及人民的血腥进攻互相配合的。他们害怕亚非各国反对殖民主义要求民族独立的运动的高涨，他们也害怕社会主义国家和亚非许多民族独立国家之间的友好合作关系的日益发展。因此，他们企图一方面用颠覆活动牵制住社会主义国家，另一方面迅速地以武力恢复他们对埃及人民的殖民统治。但是，正像在匈牙利一样，帝国主义者对埃及的侵略计划也完全失算了。由于埃及和阿拉伯各国人民的坚决抵抗，由于全世界爱好和平和主持正义的国家和人民的强烈谴责，由于社会主义国家、特别是苏联的严正警告，英法和以色列不得不同意停战和从埃及撤出他们的侵略军队。埃及抗战的胜利，鼓舞了一切被压迫民族和附属国家争取独立的斗争。并且向他们证明，在进行这种正义的斗争的时候，他们的朋友遍于全世界，他们可以指望社会主义国家的最坚决的支持和同情。
    帝国主义者在匈牙利的冒险和对埃及的侵略，都已经遭到了严重的失败。但是，这并不是说，帝国主义者已经甘心于他们的失败了。他们还在企图通过联合国来对匈牙利进行干涉。他们还在散布各种欺骗性的口号和谎言，企图挑起狭隘的民族感情，破坏社会主义各国的团结一致。同时，在中近东，英法势力的削弱引起了美国政府对这个地区的更大的野心。最近美国所宣布的“艾森豪威尔主义”，目的就在于把经济和政治的奴役强加在这个地区的人民头上，并且通过敌对性的军事集团在这个地区进行军事扩张，直到武力干涉。这一切，就要求社会主义国家和世界上其他爱好和平的国家和人民继续提高警惕，不断进行斗争，来粉碎帝国主义的一切阴谋和诡计。
    我们社会主义国家为了维护和平，和缓国际紧张局势，一直进行着巨大的努力。最近苏联政府关于裁军问题的建议是对和平事业又一次重大的贡献。我们坚持不同社会制度的国家和平共处，发展相互间的外交关系和经济文化关系，密切各国人民之间的来往和接触。我们坚持以和平谈判解决一切国际争端，坚持在各国关系中遵守和平共处的五项原则，坚决反对准备新的世界战争。尽管最近以来帝国主义侵略势力曾经使国际局势有一定程度的紧张，但是，我们相信，经过我们社会主义国家和世界上其他爱好和平的力量的共同努力，国际局势是会重新转向和缓的。历史的车轮是帝国主义侵略势力扭转不了的，和平的力量终将战胜战争的力量。
    和平、民主和社会主义的力量在对帝国主义的斗争中获得了一条宝贵的经验，那就是加强以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结，不论对社会主义事业，或者对全世界的民族独立运动和和平事业来说，都是必不可少的重要条件。
    和平、民主和社会主义的力量刚经历了一次反对帝国主义进攻的严重斗争。在这个斗争中，我们取得了无可争辩的胜利，同时也获得了一条宝贵的经验，那就是，加强以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结一致，不论对我们的社会主义事业来说，或者对全世界的民族独立运动和和平事业来说，都是必不可少的重要条件。
    社会主义国家是由共产主义的理想和目标联结在一起的，它们之间的相互关系必须符合无产阶级国际主义的原则；社会主义各国又是独立的主权国家，它们之间的相互关系又必须符合马克思列宁主义关于民族平等的原则。过去社会主义各国在相互关系方面并不是一切都是正常的。但是，他们之间兄弟般的团结和互助显然处于更重要的地位。而且，社会主义各国在相互关系方面的一切问题，都是可以通过友好协商求得解决的。
    1956年10月30日，苏联政府发表了关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言。1956年11月1日中国政府也发表了支持苏联政府这个宣言的声明。在这以后，苏联又分别同波兰、罗马尼亚和德意志民主共和国进行了会谈，并且发表了声明。今年初，保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、苏联和捷克斯洛伐克五国举行了会谈并且发表了公报。最近，中国也同苏联、德意志民主共和国、波兰和匈牙利进行了会谈，并且已经发表了或者将要发表联合公报和声明。这一切，对于改善社会主义各国的相互关系，进一步巩固社会主义各国的团结，加强社会主义各国人民反对帝国主义侵略势力的斗争，都具有极其重要的作用。帝国主义侵略势力知道得很清楚，只要离开社会主义阵营强大的中心苏联，其他社会主义国家就比较容易各个击破，因此，他们尽一切力量进行反对苏联的煽动。这种煽动已经遭到可耻的失败，并且还将继续遭到可耻的失败。我们社会主义国家正在用对于社会主义事业的坚定性，用对于社会主义各国团结一致原则的坚定性，来粉碎敌人的毒计。
    中苏两国的友好团结是社会主义国家伟大团结的一个重要部分，它关系着两国八亿人口的最根本的利益。危害了这个利益，其他利益也将受到危害。
    中苏两国的友好团结是社会主义国家伟大团结的一个重要部分。我们两国的友好团结关系着两国八亿人口的最根本的利益。危害了这个利益，其他的利益也就必然要随着遭到危害。因此，中国人民将继续以全力加强和发展我们两个伟大国家的友好团结。我们的团结是建筑在马克思列宁主义关于民族平等和无产阶级国际主义的原则的基础之上的，因此是永恒的、不可分离的、牢不可破的。世界上没有任何力量能够分开我们。帝国主义者企图破坏我们两国团结的一切阴谋诡计，都是注定要遭到失败的。
    同志们和朋友们！我愿意保证，我们一定要把伟大的苏联人民对于中国人民的热爱，要把今天皮卢金、齐列夫、里亚齐采娃和布尔加宁同志讲话中对于中国人民的期望，转达给六万万中国人民。中国人民在苏联人民和苏联朋友的鼓励之下将会更好地学习，更努力地工作，以便不辜负你们的热爱和期望。
    中国人民最可靠的朋友——伟大的苏联人民万岁！
    中苏两国人民之间兄弟般的友谊和伟大的团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义国家的伟大团结万岁！
    全世界人民的大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
