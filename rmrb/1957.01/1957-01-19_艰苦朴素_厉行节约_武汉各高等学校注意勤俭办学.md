Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 18th: Universities in the Wuhan area are paying attention to running schools diligently and thriftily.

The president of the Central China Institute of Technology recently delivered a mobilization report on "Hard Work and Plain Living, Practicing Economy, Running Schools Diligently and Thriftily" within the school, criticizing the erroneous idea held by some that "schools are not like enterprises and cannot save much money." The school also launched a waste-reduction inspection. The production increase and economy committee established at the Hubei Normal College at the end of last year also recently decided on five specific measures for the entire school, including adjusting institutions and reducing expenditures.

Some schools with insufficient classrooms are adjusting their use of space. Leaders of the Central China Agricultural College and the Central China Institute of Technology have moved their offices to simpler buildings or merged offices; many faculty, staff, and workers have voluntarily lowered their housing grade to ease the current tension in teaching and student housing.

The Wuhan Technical College of Surveying and Mapping, which was criticized by newspapers and radio for serious food waste, has recently implemented a system in the student canteen where dishes are distributed according to the actual number of people at each table during normal times and meals are prepared according to the number of diners on holidays, avoiding the phenomenon of blind supply. Catering staff at the Wuhan Medical College are carefully calculating and saving grain on the principle of ensuring that students and faculty eat well and are full.

The affiliated factories and laboratories of many schools have paid attention to strengthening management. Some employees are paying attention to using waste materials to meet teaching needs.

    艰苦朴素　厉行节约
    武汉各高等学校注意勤俭办学
    据新华社武汉18日电　武汉地区各高等学校注意勤俭办学。
    华中工学院院长最近在校内作了“艰苦朴素、厉行节约、勤俭办学”的动员报告，批判了某些人认为“学校不像企业，省不了几个钱”的错误思想。学校并且开展了一次反浪费检查。湖北师范专科学校去年年底成立的增产节约委员会，最近也决定了在全校调整机构、减少开支等五项具体措施。
    一些校舍不够用的学校都在调整用房。华中农学院和华中工学院的领导人把办公室迁移到比较简陋的房屋里去或者是合并办公；不少教职员和工人自愿降低住房等级，以缓和目前教学用房和学生用房的紧张状况。
    曾经因严重浪费粮食而遭到报纸和人民广播电台批评的武汉测量制图学院，最近在学生食堂里实行了平时按每桌实有人数分菜、假日按用膳人数准备伙食的制度，避免了盲目供应的现象。武汉医学院的炊事人员在保证学生和教职人员吃好、吃饱的原则下，精打细算节约粮食。
    许多学校的附属工厂和实验室已经注意加强管理。有的职工注意利用废料，满足教学上的需要。
