    Who said "The Federation of Industry and Commerce can be dispensed with?"
    After the implementation of full industry-wide public-private partnership in private industry and commerce in Wuyuan County, Jiangxi Province, some people mistakenly believed: "The Federation of Industry and Commerce has no function anymore and can be dispensed with." In some places, they even simply occupied the office housing of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. For example, the house of the Fuchun District branch of the Federation of Industry and Commerce was taken over by the local agricultural cooperative and turned into a tofu workshop and livestock farm. The houses of the Qinghua and Jiangwan branches of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, two larger market towns, were occupied by agricultural cooperatives and used as warehouses and production team offices; even the office space for the staff of the Federation of Industry and Commerce was gone. Industrialists and businessmen had no place to hold meetings or study. The director of a district supply and marketing cooperative even said to the cadres of the Federation of Industry and Commerce: "Give your house to our cooperative as a warehouse; your cadres can come to work in the supply and marketing cooperative, and the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative can take care of your work." I think the above ideas and practices are all wrong. After the implementation of full industry-wide public-private partnership in capitalist industry and commerce, the Federation of Industry and Commerce still has the necessity of its existence. It still plays the role of a bridge and link between the government and the industrial and commercial circles; it undertakes the important task of helping industrialists and businessmen to carry out self-reform and implement government policies. Therefore, it should not be discriminated against.

### 谁说“工商联可以不要了”？

    谁说“工商联可以不要了”？
    江西省婺源县的私营工商业实行了全行业公私合营以后，有些人就错误地认为：“工商业联合会没有什么作用了，可以不要了。”有的地方，甚至干脆把工商业联合会的办公住房给占用了。如赋春区工商联分会的房子，被当地农业社搞去做了豆腐作坊和畜牧场。清华、江湾两个较大集镇的工商联分会的房子，被农业社占去做了仓库和生产队办公室；连工商联的工作人员办公的地方也没有了。工商业者开会、学习也没有地方。有一个区供销社的主任，竟向工商联的干部说：“你们的房子给我们合作社做仓库；你们的干部，到供销社来工作，你们的工作，让供销社的干部代搞一下就可以了。”我想，以上那些想法和作法，都是不对的。在资本主义工商业实行全行业公私合营后，工商业联合会目前还有它存在的必要，它仍然起着政府同工商界之间的桥梁和纽带的作用；担负着帮助工商业者进行自我改造和执行政府政策的重大任务，因此，决不应该歧视它。
