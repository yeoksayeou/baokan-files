　　I lay unconscious on the bed for seven days and seven nights, unaware of how I got through it. When I just regained consciousness, feeling severe pain all over, especially in my head and right shoulder, I vaguely saw a white figure beside the bed. I couldn't remember anything else.

　　Now, more than ten days have passed. Although I still can't get out of bed, the pain has lessened a lot, and my mind has fully recovered. When I close my eyes, I see the familiar running track on the training ground, the obstacles made of grass fences, vaulting boxes, and ditches. The fast horse suddenly leaps, and I hear a boom in my head...

　　I look around. This is a small ward with two beds, separated into inner and outer sections. The outer section is occupied by an old battalion commander who had surgery not long ago. We can talk freely by opening the window between us. Many things about my illness I learned from the old battalion commander, and I also learned that the white figure was Sister Yin.

　　Sister Yin, short and round-faced, with a Shanghai accent, always has a kind smile. Although she only looks about twenty-five or twenty-six years old, everyone, regardless of age, calls her Sister Yin.

　　From the day I was admitted, she has been taking care of me. As soon as I regained consciousness, she was transferred away. Later, she came to see me, asking if I was eating well, if my head hurt, and if I could sleep well. Sometimes she would touch my head, smile, and say "little devil" before leaving.

　　Why hasn't she come these past few days?

　　I heard from the old battalion commander that during the days when I was still in danger, Sister Yin stayed by my bedside all day long, wiping my excrement and urine, and feeding me one mouthful of food and one sip of water at a time. She wouldn't leave even for a short while when someone else replaced her to eat.

　　One day, a "reckless fellow" came to see the old battalion commander, and his voice was a little loud when he entered. This angered Sister Yin. A person who is always smiling is especially intimidating when they get angry. The "reckless fellow" scurried away like a mouse. "Sister Yin is angry!" The convalescents all knew about this, and from then on, everyone tiptoed when they walked to the door.

　　When the smile reappeared on Sister Yin's face, everyone understood what was happening. "The little devil won't die," the convalescents estimated. Sure enough, from that time on, my illness gradually improved...

　　I once listened to the old battalion commander recounting these things with tears in my eyes. Even now, I can't suppress the excitement in my heart. I wanted to say some words of gratitude to her several times, but what could I say? Seeing her once a day would be a great comfort to me, and it would seem like I was expressing my gratitude to her. But now I can't see her. Could it be that Sister Yin is sick? Or has she been transferred from this hospital?

　　"Battalion commander... Battalion commander!" I shouted anxiously.

　　The old battalion commander rubbed his eyes, propped himself up, and looked at me strangely: "What's the matter?"

　　"Why haven't I seen Sister Yin for so long?"

　　"You little devil, I thought it was something important, making such a fuss." After saying that, he lay down again, lit a cigarette, and then leisurely asked me:

　　"Have you heard the twenty-second bed screaming these past few nights?"

　　This irrelevant question left me unable to answer for a moment.

　　Indeed, I haven't heard the twenty-second bed screaming these past few days. This old man, who lives in a room at the end of the corridor, has a tumor in his stomach. Every night around twelve o'clock, he would be in so much pain that he would scream for the nurse to come. Although the nurse would come quickly, these one or two screams filled with pain sounded particularly miserable and unsettling in the dead of night. Some patients were bothered by being awakened from their sleep so often.

　　"Yes, I haven't heard the twenty-second bed scream these past few days. But what does this have to do with Sister Yin?" I asked him doubtfully.

　　"It has a lot to do with it," the old battalion commander chuckled, as if deliberately teasing me: "Because Sister Yin is on the night shift this month!"

　　So that's what it was: Sister Yin doesn't sit in the nurse's office when she's on the night shift. After taking care of the other patients, she simply takes a stool and sits at the door of the twenty-second bed. As soon as she hears the old man wake up and turn over, she goes over to take care of him before he even has a chance to scream. That's why we haven't heard the twenty-second bed scream, and that's why I haven't seen Sister Yin.

    尹大姐
    王兵
    我七天七夜不省人事地躺在床上，自己也不知道是如何过去的。当我刚刚恢复知觉，感到周身尤其是头和右肩剧痛的时候，只模糊地看到床头旁有个白色的身影。此外什么也记不起来了。
    现在又过了十多天，虽然还下不得床，疼痛总算减轻了好多，神智也完全恢复过来了。一闭上眼睛，我就会看见练兵场上熟悉的跑道，用草栅、跳箱、土沟构成的一道道障碍物，飞快的马猛一纵身，脑子轰的一声……。
    我环顾四周，这是一间分里外间有两张床位的小病房。外间住着一位开过刀不久的老营长。我们打开隔窗，便可以自由对话。我在病中的许多事情，都是从老营长口里才知道的，我并且知道了那白色身影就是尹大姐。
    尹大姐，矮矮的个子，圆圆的脸，操着上海口音，总是一副可亲的笑容。虽然只有二十五、六岁的样子，但大家不拘年龄大小都一律叫她尹大姐。
    从入院那天起，就是她专门照护我。当我神智刚刚清醒过来，她就调走了。以后她还来看过我，问我吃饭好不好，头疼不疼，能睡好觉不？有时摸摸我的头，笑着说声“小鬼”就走。
    这几天她为什么不来了呢？
    听老营长说过：在我还没有摆脱危险的那些日子里，尹大姐整天在床边看守着，为我擦屎擦尿，一口饭一口水的喂我。别人替换她去吃饭的一小会工夫，她都不肯离开。
    有一天一个“冒失鬼”跑来看老营长，一进门声音大了些，这下可气坏了尹大姐。一个总是笑眯眯的人偶然生起气来，样子格外怕人。“冒失鬼”像只老鼠似的溜走了。“尹大姐生气了！”休养员们都知道了这回事，以后谁走到门口都蹑手蹑脚地。
    当尹大姐的脸上又重现出笑容的时候，大家都体会到这是咋回事。“小鬼死不了啦”，休养员们这样估量着。果然从那时开始，我的病便一天天好转起来……。
    我曾经噙着眼泪听老营长讲述这些，现在想起来还抑制不住内心的激动，几次想对她说些感激的话，可是能说些什么呢？每天能见她一面，对我就是莫大的安慰，也好像对她表示了谢意似的。而现在却见不到她了。莫非尹大姐病了？或是调离这个医院了？
    “营长……营长！”我急得喊了起来。
    老营长揉了揉眼睛，支起身子奇怪地望了我一眼：“甚么事？”
    “尹大姐怎么好久不见了呢？”
    “你这个小鬼，我当是什么事，大惊小怪的。”说完他重又躺下来，燃起一根烟，然后才慢条斯理地反问我：
    “这几天晚间，你听见二十二床喊叫没有？”
    这句没头没脑的话，问得我一时回答不出来。
    可不是，这几天确实没再听见二十二床喊叫过。这位住在走廊尽头一个房间里的老年人，肚子里长了一个瘤，每到夜里十二点左右，总要疼得喊叫护士来看他。虽然护士很快就会来到，但在夜深人静的时候，这一两声充满着痛苦的尖叫，听起来特别凄惨、难受。有些病人因为常常从睡梦中被惊醒而苦恼着。
    “是呀，这几天没听见二十二床喊。可是这和尹大姐有啥关系呢？”我疑惑地问他。
    “这关系可大了，”老营长故意捉弄我似的咯咯地笑着：“因为这个月是尹大姐值大夜班啊！”
    原来是这么回事：尹大姐值夜班，并不坐在护士办公室。把别的病人的事情料理完了以后，她干脆拿个板凳坐在二十二床的门口。只要听见老头醒来翻个身，还没等他喊出来就过去照顾他。这就是听不见二十二床喊叫的原因，也就是我没看见尹大姐的原因。
