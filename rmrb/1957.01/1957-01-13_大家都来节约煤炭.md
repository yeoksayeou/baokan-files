Beginning in the fourth quarter of last year, a situation of coal supply falling short of demand emerged. Residents in some cities and villages could not buy coal, and some factories also felt the coal supply was insufficient. National construction, people's production, and daily life have all been affected to a certain extent. Therefore, increasing coal production and conserving coal usage have become important matters before us.

Why has a situation of coal supply falling short of demand emerged? Our country's annual coal production has increased from more than 66 million tons in 1953 to more than 106 million tons in 1956, an increase of more than 60% from 1953. This rate of increase is quite fast. However, the rate of increase in the need for coal in industrial production and people's lives is even faster. For example, due to the rapid development of departments such as steel, machinery, electricity, and transportation, the coal consumption of these departments has increased from more than 27.9 million tons in 1953 to more than 48.8 million tons in 1956, an increase of more than 72%. Due to the progress of industrialization, the population of cities and industrial and mining areas has increased significantly, and the amount of coal people use has also greatly increased. Urban residents' coal consumption has increased from more than 20.5 million tons in 1953 to more than 26.4 million tons in 1956. In recent years, the sources of fuel in rural areas have also undergone great changes. Due to the expansion of economic crop areas, the amount of grain straw that can be used as fuel has been greatly reduced; due to the development of animal husbandry, much grain straw can no longer be used as fuel but must be used as feed; due to the development of the fertilizer accumulation movement, some firewood and grass cannot be used as fuel but are used as fertilizer. Therefore, coal consumption in rural areas has also greatly increased. According to statistics from the State Economic Commission, the amount of coal sold to rural areas has increased from more than 10.3 million tons in 1953 to more than 23.6 million tons in 1956, an increase of more than double. The rate of increase in coal production cannot keep up with the rate of increase in demand; this is the fundamental reason why coal supply falls short of demand.

So, how do we solve this problem? The fundamental solution is, of course, to continue to tap the production potential of existing coal mines and expand the scale of coal mine capital construction, and greatly increase coal production. However, national investment is limited, and mines cannot be built in large numbers all at once. Moreover, the construction of mines takes a long time. Generally, medium and small mines take two or three years from construction to production, and large mines take about five years. After being put into production, it takes another three to five years to reach its designed production capacity. Although existing coal mines can still increase some production, they are still far from the required level. Therefore, the contradiction of coal supply falling short of demand cannot be solved by simply increasing production in a short period of time. In addition to striving to increase production, everyone should act together to conserve coal.

Generally speaking, everyone has been advocating saving coal, whether it is for production or domestic use, over the years. However, if we seriously examine it, the phenomenon of wasting coal is still quite serious in some units at times.

In terms of domestic coal use, some agencies' coal plans are too high, the heating time is too long, and the indoor temperature is too high. Some units do not pay attention to educating boiler workers on saving coal, nor do they pay attention to improving the operating skills of boiler workers, thus greatly exceeding the standard in coal consumption. The phenomenon of air and water leaks in some heating pipes is very serious, consuming too much coal. In some agencies, the ash that is thrown away also contains some combustible coal.

In terms of coal use for production, in addition to the electricity, metallurgy, and railway departments, which use the most coal and pay more attention to saving coal, other coal-using departments do not pay enough attention. Some enterprises believe that the proportion of coal used in product costs is very small, and wasting a little doesn't matter. Some construction units believe that they are building key projects and should be given as much coal as they need, completely disregarding whether the coal is used reasonably. Some units are only willing to use good coal and are unwilling to use coal of poor quality. A lot of coal is wasted in this way. The case of Jilin Shixian Paper Mill wasting coal is a prominent example. The combustible matter in this factory's slag is about 30%. When the workers dump the slag, nearby residents snatch it away because they can pick out a lot of coal from the slag. This factory wastes about 8,400 tons of coal throughout the year, which is equivalent to more than 15% of their annual coal consumption. Even in industrial departments that pay relatively close attention to saving coal, the phenomenon of wasting coal still exists. For example, only 1 million kilocalories of heat is needed to refine one ton of steel, but the average steel plant exceeds this by 30%. If everyone changes these phenomena of wasting coal, the coal saving target can definitely be achieved.

Of course, there are also some problems in coal production and distribution that have not been well resolved, which also causes difficulties for coal-using units. For example, the quality of coal is not high, there is too much ash, and different varieties of coal cannot be supplied according to the requirements of combustion equipment. Sometimes block coal is given when mixed coal is needed, and sometimes powdered coal is given when block coal is needed, and so on. These irrational phenomena also cause a lot of waste in coal use and must be overcome.

The State Council issued an instruction on the 6th of this month, requiring state organs, people's organizations, troops, and schools at all levels across the country to save coal for heating and cooking, and requiring all units to reduce coal for heating by 15% to 25% on the original basis. In order to complete the above-mentioned task of saving coal, all organs, organizations, troops, and schools must appropriately shorten the heating time, appropriately lower the indoor temperature, improve coal-burning equipment, improve coal-burning technology, promote the experience of saving coal, and ensure the economical use of coal. We believe that the comrades of all organs, organizations, troops, and schools will definitely overcome difficulties and be happy to save some coal to support industrial construction and supply urban and rural residents.

In industrial and transportation departments, leading cadres and engineering and technical personnel of enterprises should mobilize all employees to change the view that they do not pay attention to saving coal because the proportion of coal in product costs is not large, and take effective measures to save coal. In particular, the metallurgical, electricity, railway and other departments that use the most coal, as long as they save 1%, the country can save 370,000 tons of coal this year. According to the experiment of Qiqihar Railway Bureau on the Suijia Line, only improving the coal-burning method on the locomotive can save 12.92% compared with the original. In the metallurgical industry system, taking Anshan Iron and Steel as an example, if heat supply control can be strengthened, several billion cubic meters of gas can be saved in a year. At present, there are many enterprises using small steam boilers with high coal consumption in various places. If these enterprises can be appropriately modified, changing manual coal addition to mechanical coal addition, and changing natural ventilation to forced ventilation, a large amount of coal can also be saved.

In order to help coal-using units save coal, coal mines need to actively find ways to improve the quality of coal and increase the variety of coal. This requires fully utilizing the capacity of existing screening equipment and increasing some screening equipment as much as possible, so as to change the method of supplying mixed coal to the method of supplying various varieties of coal according to the requirements of various equipment as soon as possible. This can enable all coal-using units to save a lot of coal and enable the produced coal to exert greater economic benefits.

Nearly half of the coal produced in our country every year is supplied to urban and rural residents. At present, the state is still making its best efforts to take out some coal from increasing coal production and reducing heating coal consumption in organs, troops, organizations, and schools to increase the coal supply to urban and rural residents. However, due to China's vast territory, large population, and backward industry (coal industry is no exception), the rapidly increasing needs of urban and rural residents for coal are difficult to fully meet in a short period of time. Therefore, in addition to hoping that urban and rural residents who use coal pay attention to saving coal, we also hope that everyone will think of more ways to develop fuel sources to overcome the difficulty of insufficient coal supply.

### 大家都来节约煤炭

    大家都来节约煤炭
    从去年第四季度开始，出现了煤炭供不应求的情况。有些城市和乡村的居民买不到煤炭，有些工厂也感到煤炭供应不足。国家建设和人民的生产以及日常生活，都受到了一定的影响。因此，增加煤炭的生产，节约使用煤炭，就成为我们眼前的一件重要事情。
    为什么出现煤炭供不应求的情况呢？我国煤炭的年产量已由1953年的六千六百多万吨提高到1956年的一亿零六百多万吨，1956年比1953年增长了60％还多。这个增长速度是相当快的。可是工业生产和人民生活对于煤的需要量的增长速度却更快。例如由于钢铁、机械、电力、交通运输等部门的生产迅速发展，这些部门的生产用煤量已从1953年的二千七百九十多万吨增加到1956年的四千八百多万吨，即增加了72％多。由于工业化的进展，城市和工矿区的人口大量增加，人们用煤的数量也大大增加了。城市居民用煤量已从1953年的二千零五十万吨增加到1956年的二千六百四十多万吨。近年来，农村燃料来源也起了很大变化。由于经济作物区的扩大，可作燃料的谷草大量减少了；由于牧畜业的发展，许多谷草不能再作燃料而要拿去做饲料了；由于积肥运动的开展，一部分柴草也不能作燃料而作了肥料。因此，农村用煤量也大大增加了。据国家经济委员会统计，煤炭销售到农村的数量已从1953年的一千零三十多万吨，增加到1956年的二千三百六十多万吨，即增加了一倍多。煤炭生产增长的速度赶不上需要增长的速度，这就是煤炭供不应求的根本原因。
    那末，怎样解决这个问题呢？根本的办法当然是继续挖掘原有煤矿的生产潜力和扩大煤矿基本建设的规模，大量增产煤炭。但是，国家投资有限，矿井不能一下子建得很多。而且，建设矿井需要时间较长。一般中小型矿井从建设到投入生产需要二、三年，大型矿井需要五年左右，投入生产以后达到它设计的生产能力还得要三年到五年的时间。原有煤矿虽然还可增加一些生产，但距离需要的水平还很远。因此，煤炭供不应求的矛盾，短时间内不是单靠增产可以解决的。除了努力增产而外，大家都应该一致行动起来，节约煤炭。
    一般说来，无论是生产用煤还是生活用煤，历年来大家都是提倡节约的。但是，如果认真检查一下，浪费煤炭的现象，有的时候在有些单位还是相当严重的。
    在生活用煤方面，有的机关用煤计划偏高，取暖时间过长，室内温度过高。有的单位不注意对锅炉工人进行节约煤炭的教育，也不注意提高锅炉工人的操作技术，因而使得煤炭的消耗量大大超过了标准。有的暖气管道漏气漏水的现象很严重，耗费煤炭过多。有的机关扔掉的炉灰中，也夹杂着若干可以燃烧的煤。
    在生产用煤方面，除了用煤最多的电力、冶金、铁道等部门比较注意节约用煤以外，其他用煤部门是不够注意的。有的企业认为所用煤炭在产品成本中占的比重很小，浪费点没有什么关系。有的建设单位认为自己建设的是重点工程，要多少煤就给多少煤，就根本不管煤炭使用得是否合理。有的单位只愿使用好煤，不愿使用质量较差的煤。这样浪费的煤是不少的。吉林石岘造纸厂浪费煤炭的情形就是一个显著的例子。这个厂的炉渣可燃物约有30％，当工人们倒炉渣的时候，附近居民将炉渣一抢而光，因为炉渣里可以拣出不少煤来。这个厂全年浪费煤炭约八千四百吨，等于他们全年用煤量的15％以上。就在比较注意节约煤炭的工业部门中，浪费煤炭的现象也还是有的。例如每炼一吨钢材，只需要热量一百万大卡就行了，但一般钢厂却平均超出30％。如果大家都把这些浪费煤炭的现象改变过来，煤炭的节约目标就一定可以实现。
    当然，在煤炭的生产和分配中，也有若干问题还没有很好解决，也造成了用煤单位的困难。例如煤炭质量不高，灰分过多，不能按着燃烧设备的要求供给不同品种的煤炭。有的要块煤给了混合煤，有的要粉煤反而给了块煤，等等。这种不合理的现象同样造成了煤炭使用上的许多浪费，也必须克服。
    国务院已于本月6日发出指示，要求全国各地各级国家机关、人民团体、部队和学校节约取暖和炊事用煤，要求各单位取暖用煤在原有基础上核减15％到25％。为了完成上述节约煤炭的任务，各机关、团体、部队和学校，就要适当缩短取暖的时间，适当降低室内的温度，改进烧煤设备，提高烧煤技术，推广节约煤炭的经验，保证节约用煤。我们相信，各机关、团体、部队和学校的同志们，一定能克服困难，乐于节省出一些煤炭来支持工业建设和供给城乡居民。
    在工业和交通运输部门中，企业的领导干部和工程技术人员，应当发动全体职工，改变那种认为煤炭在产品成本中占的比重不大就不注意节约的看法，采取节约煤炭的有效措施。特别是使用煤炭最多的冶金、电力、铁路等部门，只要节约1％，今年全国就可以节约三十七万吨煤炭。据齐齐哈尔铁路局在绥佳线试验，只将机车上的烧煤方法加以改进，就比原来节约12.92％。在冶金工业系统，以鞍钢为例，如果能加强送热控制，一年就可节省煤气几亿立方公尺。目前各地使用耗煤量大的小型蒸气锅炉的企业很多，这些企业如果能适当地改装，将人工加煤改为机械加煤，将自然通风改为强制通风，也可节约大量煤炭。
    为了帮助用煤单位节约煤炭，煤矿方面有必要积极设法提高煤炭的质量，增加煤炭的品种。这就要充分发挥现有筛选设备的能力，并且尽可能增加一些筛选设备，以便早日将供应混合煤的办法，改变为按照各种设备的要求供应各种品种的煤炭的办法。这就可以使各用煤单位节约大量的煤炭，使生产的煤炭能够发挥更大的经济效果。
    我国每年所生产的煤炭，将近半数是供应城乡居民使用的。现在，国家仍在尽最大努力，从增加煤炭生产，减少机关、部队、团体和学校取暖用煤等方面，拿出一些煤炭来，增加对城乡居民的煤炭供应量。但是，由于我国地区辽阔，人口众多，工业落后（煤炭工业也不例外），城乡居民对煤炭的迅速增长的需要，是很难在短时期内完全满足的。因此，除了希望用煤的城乡居民注意节约用煤以外，更希望大家多想些办法，开辟燃料来源，以克服煤炭供应不足的困难。
