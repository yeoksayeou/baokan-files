    Xinhua News Agency report: The Shanghai Zhonghua Cosmetics Factory, formed by the merger of seventeen newly jointly-operated small factories and individual businesses, has capitalized on the characteristic of small factories being able to easily change product types, and now produces more than one hundred more products than it did six months ago.
    This factory, with more than 140 people, is divided into more than ten production teams in the workshop. These teams change product types almost every day, and some teams change ten types a day. Although the original small factories were flexible in their operations, they had few people, making it difficult to increase the number of new products. Now, before each month begins, the factory arranges which groups will produce which products on which day, and prepares for the supply of raw materials. When the tasks of each group differ greatly, temporary organization of mutual support is arranged. This adapts to the characteristic of variable product types. Most of the products that had been discontinued by the original factories for many years have been restored, and more than sixty new varieties will be added this year.

    发挥小厂的优越性
    据新华社讯　由十七个新合营小厂和个体户合并成的上海中华化妆品厂，发挥小厂容易改变品种的特点，现在生产的产品比半年前增加了一百多种。
    这个一百四十多人的工厂，在车间里分成十多个生产小组。这些小组几乎每天都要调换产品品种，有的小组一天要调换十个品种。原来的小厂虽然经营灵活，但是人数少，增加新品种困难。现在每个月之前，厂里就把各小组那一天生产那几个品种安排好，对原材料供应也作好准备，在各组任务多少悬殊的时候，临时组织相互支援。这样就适应了品种多变的特点，原来各厂停产多年的产品大多已经恢复，今年新增的品种将有六十多种。
