Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi Dispatch: The reconstruction of the highway from Urumqi to Korla officially commenced on the 4th. This highway will pass through the Tianshan Mountains, where ice and snow persist year-round. It will be more than 340 kilometers long, which is more than 130 kilometers shorter than the current highway from Urumqi to Korla via Yanqi. After the reconstruction of this highway, it will not only facilitate the flow of materials between the north and south of Xinjiang, but also facilitate the mining of iron ore buried in the Nanshan Mountains, more than 200 kilometers from Urumqi, to meet the needs of the expanded Xinjiang August 1st Iron and Steel Plant.

The construction of this highway will involve work on steep cliffs and ridges, and the excavation of tunnels hundreds of meters long. In 1952, officers and soldiers of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army built this road into a passable trail, but it was later destroyed by mountain floods. Now, a production and construction unit of the Xinjiang Military Region has undertaken the arduous task of rebuilding this highway.

    乌鲁木齐到库尔勒的公路
    据新华社乌鲁木齐电　从乌鲁木齐到库尔勒的公路4日正式动工重建。这条公路将通过全年冰雪不化的天山，全长三百四十多公里，比现在由乌鲁木齐绕道焉耆到库尔勒的公路要短一百三十多公里。这条公路重建后，不但使南北疆物资交流更加畅通，并且可以便利开采埋藏在距乌鲁木齐二百多公里的南山中的铁矿，供应新疆八一钢铁厂扩建后的需要。
    修建这条公路要在峭壁峻岭处施工，要打通几百公尺长的隧道。1952年，中国人民解放军新疆军区的官兵们，曾把这条路修建成便道通车，后来被山洪冲毁。现在新疆军区的一支生产建设部队又担负了重新修建这条公路的艰巨任务。
