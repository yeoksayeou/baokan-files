    Utilize Advanced Experiences from the Masses to Create Conditions for Greater Production Increases
    Guangdong Province Plans to Improve Eight Million Mu of Soil This Year
    Striving to Gradually Achieve the Plan of Averaging 800 Jin of Grain per Mu Annually Province-Wide Within Six Years

    (Our Dispatch) Guangdong Province plans to carry out soil improvement work on eight million mu of paddy fields this year. After gaining experience, it plans to gradually transform the province's 26 million mu of low-yield fields into high-yield fields. If this can be achieved, the plan to reach an average grain yield of 800 jin per mu in 1962 can be guaranteed. Currently, the Huizhou, Zhaoqing, Shaoguan, Shantou, and Foshan special districts of this province have initially formulated soil improvement plans and dispatched a large number of technical cadres to the countryside to conduct investigations and research. At the district-wide conference of soil improvement activists held in Huizhou Special District on the 6th, a call was also made for activists to lead the broad masses of farmers to march towards low-yield soil.

    Although Guangdong Province is located in the subtropics, the unit area yield of rice is very low. The average annual yield per mu in the province is only about 500 jin, and in low-yield areas, it is only 200 to 300 jin per mu. However, in the Chaoshan Plain and some high-yield fields, the yield per mu reaches more than 2,000 jin. From this, it can be seen that the potential for increasing grain production in Guangdong Province is very large. In addition to extensive cultivation, the main reason for the low yield is that these soils are mostly heavy clay, cold and waterlogged, sandy, shallow and infertile, and acidic, which makes the rice roots develop poorly, resulting in very low yields. Last year, various localities conducted soil improvement experiments in many agricultural cooperatives, and generally, production increased by 50% to more than 100%. The most prominent example is the two mu of cold and waterlogged mountain fields in the Heping Agricultural Cooperative of Wuhua County, which used to produce only 400 jin of rice per mu annually. After soil improvement last year, it reached 1,050 jin, an increase of more than 150%.

    The guiding principle for soil improvement in Guangdong Province this year is to promote the existing advanced experiences of the masses, requiring low investment and high returns, from simple to complex, and adopting different measures for different soils. For the improvement of acidic soil, the main measures are to open ditches for drainage, level the field surface, and apply lime and warming fertilizers; for cold and waterlogged soil, winter plowing and sun exposure are carried out, cold springs are eliminated, and old brick mud and pond mud are mixed in; for shallow and infertile soil, the measures are to plant leguminous crops in winter rotation, add topsoil, and use new farm tools for deep plowing year by year; for heavy clay soil, fine sand is added, and a large amount of organic fertilizer is applied.

    In order to realize the soil improvement plan, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial Department of Agriculture have decided to strengthen specific leadership. The South China Agricultural Science Research Institute, the South China Agricultural College, and the agricultural experiment stations in various localities are also actively cooperating to conduct various soil analysis and improvement experiments, so that the practical experience of the masses of farmers and scientific technology can be closely combined.

    运用群众中的先进经验为更多增产创造条件
    广东省今年计划改良土壤八百万亩
    争取六年内逐步实现全省平均每亩年产粮八百斤的计划
    本报讯　广东省今年计划在八百万亩稻田里开展土壤改良工作。并准备在取得经验以后，逐步把全省二千六百万亩低产田改变为高产田。如果做到了这一点，在1962年平均每亩粮食产量达到八百斤的计划就可以保证实现。目前，这个省的惠阳、高要、韶关、汕头、佛山等专区，已经初步制定出改良土壤方案，并派出大批技术干部下乡进行调查研究工作。惠阳专区在6日召开的全区改良土壤积极分子大会上，还号召积极分子带动广大农民向低产的土壤进军。
    广东省虽然地处亚热带，但水稻的单位面积产量却很低，全省平均每亩年产量才不过五百来斤，低产地区还有亩产二、三百斤的，而潮汕平原和少数丰产田却有的亩产量达到二千多斤。从这里可以看出，广东省土地的增产潜力是很大的。低产的原因，除了耕作粗放以外，主要是这些土壤多是重粘土、冷底田、沙土田、浅瘦田和反夋田等，使得水稻根部发育不好，产量很低。去年各地在不少农业社中作了改良土壤的试验，一般都能增产50％到一倍以上。最突出的是五华县和平农业社的二亩山坑冷底田，往年每亩年产稻谷只有四百斤，去年改良土壤后，就达到了一千零五十斤，增产一倍半以上。
    今年广东省改良土壤的方针，主要是推广群众已有的先进经验，要求做到投资少，收效大，由简到繁，分别不同的土壤采取不同的措施。对反夋田的改良，主要采取开沟排水、平整田面，并施用石灰和暖性肥料；对于冷底田，则进行犁冬晒白，排除冷泉，混入旧砖泥和塘泥；对于浅瘦田，是采取冬种豆科作物轮栽，进行客土，使用新式农具逐年深耕；对重粘土则加入细沙，大量增施有机肥料。
    为了实现改良土壤的计划，中共广东省委员会和省农业厅决定加强具体领导。华南农业科学研究所、华南农学院和各地的农业试验站，也积极配合进行各种土壤分析和改良的试验研究工作，使农民群众的实际经验和科学技术密切结合起来。（李少球）
