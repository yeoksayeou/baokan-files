    Young Father's Words
    Zhong Shouwen

    Comrade Zi Gang wrote an article in the "Wenhui Daily": "Respectfully Presented to Young Mothers," requesting mothers to take on the natural duty of breastfeeding infants.
    I am a young father, with a child who is not yet one year old. After reading Comrade Zi Gang's article, I cannot help but feel something.
    My wife is a primary school teacher. My home is next door to a primary school, and there are dozens of primary schools in the district where we live. However, she has to cross three districts and change trains twice to get to her workplace. If the journey is smooth, it takes her an hour on the road. In the evenings, she has to prepare lessons, grade homework, and attend various meetings. Often, she attends meetings, then prepares lessons, and then grades homework. As a result, she usually cannot come home during the week. Sometimes, even on Saturdays and Sundays, she cannot come home, either to "protect the school" or to attend meetings.
    Before the child was born, she had also planned to breastfeed. But how could that be possible? "The child will starve!" When I said this, I was not joking at all, because she often missed meal times herself.
    After childbirth, her body was very weak and she has not recovered. Her work is still so busy. Once, she was sick but was still required to convene a meeting. She sat in bed and chaired the meeting. Finally, she fainted.
    "Your wife is so thin! She needs to pay attention to her health!" Friends always say this to me when they see her. I also urge her to see a doctor, but she has no time.
    One day, I was on the tram with her, and she suddenly fainted again halfway. She said, "I can't take it anymore!" She closed her eyes as if she were dead. I was terrified, and the passengers on the tram were also terrified. They quickly gave her a seat and faced her towards the window, and she slowly woke up.
    "You must go to see a doctor!" But she still couldn't find the time.
    I often call her and ask, "Have you seen the doctor yet?" She always says helplessly, "I really don't have time!" Because it takes half a day to see a doctor.
    My wife is very enthusiastic about her work, and I am proud of that. But I can't help but worry about her health. At one time, in addition to teaching, she was responsible for many projects. The district education section gave her tasks, the Youth League gave her tasks, and the trade union also gave her tasks. She was responsible for leading teachers' political studies, organizing teachers' recreational activities, and even judging the sports meet. She was also a post office distributor...
    Fortunately, this phenomenon is gradually being corrected.
    This summer, we will have a second child. When we read Comrade Zi Gang's article, we planned how to let this child have her mother's milk.
    Comrade Zi Gang said: "Mothers' sense of responsibility seems to have weakened in recent years." For many mothers, they must feel wronged. The problem is that we lack the necessary care for mothers. "Taking leave without pay for half a year" to breastfeed the child is probably just a beautiful idea. I only hope that my wife can work in a school closer to home; and I hope that the phenomenon of teachers being too busy can really be overcome, and that some unnecessary meetings can be greatly reduced. Only then will it be possible for the child to be nurtured by the mother.

    年轻的父亲的话
    钟守文
    子冈同志在“文汇报”上写了一篇文章：“敬赠年轻的母亲们”，要求母亲们担负起哺育乳儿的天职。
    我是一个年轻的父亲，刚有一个孩子还不到一岁，读了子冈同志的文章，不能不有所感慨。
    我的爱人是个小学教师。我家隔邻就是一个小学，我们住的一个区里有几十个小学。但是她到工作的地方却要跨越三个区，换两次电车。如果乘车顺利，路上也得花一个钟头。她晚上要备课，要批改作业，还要参加各种各样的会议，经常是开了会再备课，再批改作业。这样，平时她就没法回家来了。有时连星期六、星期天也不能回来，或者为了“护校”，或者又是开会。
    孩子出生以前，她也曾打算自己喂奶。但是怎么行呢？“孩子会给你饿死的！”我这样说着的时候，决没有一点开玩笑的意思，因为她自己就常常误了吃饭的时间。
    产后她的身体很虚弱，一直不得复原。她的工作却还是那么忙。有一次她病着，还需要她召开会议。她就坐在床上主持会议。终于晕厥了过去。
    “你的爱人真瘦啊！得好好注意她的健康呢！”朋友们每次看到她，总是那么跟我说。我也催着她去看医生，但是她没有时间。
    有天我跟她一起乘电车，半路上她又突然晕厥了。她说：“我吃不消了！”两眼一闭，就像死去似的。我骇坏了，同车的乘客也骇坏了，赶紧让她坐，让她面对着窗口，这才慢慢地苏醒了过来。
    “再也不能不去看医生了！”但她还是挤不出时间。
    我经常打电话去：“看了医生了吧？”她总是没奈何地说：“实在没有空啊！”因为看一次医生，需要整整半天。
    我的爱人工作很积极，我为此感到骄傲。但是我不能不为她的健康担心。有一个时候，她除了教课以外，担任了很多项目的工作。区教育科给她任务，青年团给她任务，工会也给她任务。领导教师的政治学习有她，组织教师的文娱活动有她，连运动会的评判也有她，邮局的发行员也有她，……
    幸好这种现象已经在逐步纠正了。
    今年夏天，我们将有第二个孩子。当我们读着子冈同志的文章的时候，我们又计议着怎样让这个孩子吃到妈妈的乳汁了。
    子冈同志说：“母亲们的责任感近年来似乎淡薄了。”对于许多母亲来说，她们是要感到委屈的。问题是在我们对母亲们缺少了必要的照顾。“留职停薪半年”来给孩子喂奶，恐怕只是一种美丽的设想。我只希望我的爱人能够在离家较近的学校工作；并且希望教师的忙乱现象真正能够克服，大大地精简掉一些不必要的会议。然后才有可能让孩子受到母亲的哺育。
