Xinhua News Agency report: The first group of 616 capitalist employees in Wuhan who left their jobs to study political theory completed their studies at the end of last year.

During the four months of study, they completed the "Political Common Sense Textbook for Industrialists and Businessmen," listened to reports on the status and role of industrialists and businessmen, the relationship between public and private partnership, and market issues. They also discussed these topics in connection with their own lives and thoughts, thereby gaining a further understanding of the laws of social development, the nature of exploitation, and the policy of peaceful transformation. At the same time, they saw their future more clearly. After understanding the source of commercial profits, commercial capitalists criticized their past view that they were "seeking profit from capital" and not engaging in exploitation. Some people who previously held negative attitudes have now changed their attitude. Whenever they return to the factory or store on holidays or during spare time, they take the initiative to approach the workers and care about the production and operation of the enterprise.

    武汉首批私方人员离职学习成绩良好
    据新华社讯　武汉市第一批离职学习政治理论的六百一十六个资方从业人员，已经在去年底学完。
    他们在四个月的学习期间，学完了“工商业者政治常识课本”，听了有关工商业者的地位和作用、公私共事关系、市场问题等报告，并且联系本身生活和思想实际进行了讨论，从而对社会发展规律、剥削的实质以及和平改造政策等都有了进一步的理解，同时比较清楚地看到了自己的前途。商业资本家们在明白了商业利润的来源以后，批判了过去认为自己是“将本求利”，没有剥削的看法。有些过去抱消极态度的人，现在改变了态度，每逢假日或课余回厂、回店，都主动地和工人接近，关心企业的生产和经营。
