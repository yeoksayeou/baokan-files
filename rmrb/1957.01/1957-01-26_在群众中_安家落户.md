    "Taking Root" Among the Masses
    By our reporter, Li Lianbin

    Who is he?

    One afternoon in late summer last year, the intense sunlight beat down on the long-parched earth. A person carrying luggage, sweating profusely, walked towards the Yousheng Agricultural Cooperative in Pogan Township, Dongxiang County, Jiangxi Province. This person was about thirty years old, with a thin face and bright eyes. Before the cooperative members could clearly see the face of this guest, they couldn't guess who it was, only that he was a cadre. Since the land reform, apart from a propaganda minister from the county party committee who stayed in their village for half a month, other county and district cadres rarely stayed in their village for more than a few days. They usually just passed through, listened to the cadres' reports, conveyed instructions from higher levels, and left. But now, seeing this person with luggage, they knew he wasn't just "passing through" but would be staying in the village for a while.

    When this guest entered the village and the agricultural cooperative's office, the cooperative members and cadres realized that he was Chen Jiefu, the deputy secretary of the county party committee.

    "Let's settle down first!"

    Deputy Secretary Chen arrived at the Yousheng Agricultural Cooperative's office just as the cooperative cadres were holding a meeting to discuss drought resistance and the cooperative's management. Based on their experience, the cooperative cadres knew that some cadres from above always had some "instructions" and "calls to action" to deliver. So, they said to Deputy Secretary Chen:

    "Please give us some instructions!"

    "I don't understand the situation yet, let's settle down first!" Deputy Secretary Chen replied frankly.

    At this meeting, Deputy Secretary Chen occasionally raised a question or interjected a few words but didn't speak too much.

    The meeting ended when the sun was about to set in the west. Afterwards, they cleared out the best room in the cooperative's office for Deputy Secretary Chen. But Deputy Secretary Chen refused. He said:

    "Don't clear out a room, I'll stay in the home of a cooperative member."

    After learning about the situation, Deputy Secretary Chen decided to stay in the Second Production Team.

    The Yousheng Agricultural Cooperative was located in a hilly area with relatively poor land and a low standard of living for the people. The living conditions in the Second Production Team were the worst in the cooperative. When Deputy Secretary Chen arrived at the Second Production Team, the head of the Second Production Team pointed to a brick house and said:

    "This is the best house in our team. The owner is a poor peasant and a military dependent, stay there!"

    "The quality of the house doesn't matter, what matters is being able to approach the masses," Deputy Secretary Chen disagreed. In the end, he found the mud house of cooperative member Xu Aichang to stay in.

    This matter quickly spread. In the evening, many people gathered, asking questions, making comments, and showing great warmth.

    Becoming One with the Masses

    Deputy Secretary Chen lived in the home of a cooperative member, eating, living, and working alongside the masses, and over time became one with them. The masses treated Deputy Secretary Chen like a family member, telling him everything that was on their minds.

    One day, Deputy Secretary Chen was weeding with the members of the Heping Agricultural Cooperative. During a break, he chatted with the members. The members mentioned that the cooperative's deputy director and production team leader, Li Yousheng, had a severe commandist style, and the members were all afraid of him. One young member boldly told Deputy Secretary Chen that he suspected Li Yousheng of embezzlement.

    Based on the feedback from other members, Deputy Secretary Chen instructed the general branch secretary to organize an accounting team to conduct an investigation, and they indeed discovered Li Yousheng's embezzlement. After this matter was resolved, even more people talked to Deputy Secretary Chen about their problems. One day, Deputy Secretary Chen was eating at the home of a member of the Yousheng Cooperative. Deputy Secretary Chen asked about their living conditions. The member said without hesitation, "There are no vegetables to eat." Deputy Secretary Chen was surprised and asked, "Why?" "There's no fertilizer." "Why?" "All the human urine and manure belong to the cooperative."

    During this conversation, Deputy Secretary Chen discovered that the cooperative members were universally concerned about the fertilizer issue for their private plots. Later, he brought up the issue of fertilizer for private plots at the cooperative committee meeting and resolved it. It was decided that human urine would be for the cooperative members' own use, and any surplus would be sold to the cooperative at a price. Human manure would be uniformly allocated by the cooperative committee according to the number of fields and the population. This ensured fertilizer for the private plots and encouraged the members' enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer.

    Deputy Secretary Chen valued the opinions of the masses and always listened attentively to them. The members said that they had always had the habit of growing radishes and asked to borrow some land from the cooperative to grow radishes. Deputy Secretary Chen studied their request. If the harvest was good, one mu of land could yield 10,000 jin of radishes, which could not only solve the problem of the members eating vegetables but also sell some to increase their income. The leaves could be used to feed pigs. Finally, he discussed it with the cooperative cadres and decided to allocate 40 mu of land to the members to grow radishes. The urgent demands of the masses were resolved.

    As a result of Deputy Secretary Chen "taking root," he heard the innermost thoughts of the masses. He conducted a series of investigations into the political, economic, living, and class conditions in the countryside, which played a significant role in correctly guiding rural work.

    He is just one of those "taking root"

    Why did Deputy Secretary Chen go to the masses to take root? Before he went down, the county party committee held countless meetings to study the issue of improving the county party committee's leadership methods. Although the leadership methods were gradually improving, the county party committee itself always felt unsatisfied. After a period of practice and a long period of consideration, everyone unanimously agreed that the key to improving leadership was to strengthen investigation and research. But strengthening investigation and research had been proposed countless times, and it was never achieved. It seemed like an old problem that couldn't be solved. After discussions among the committee members, Secretary Zhao Yingzhou made a summary. He proposed that each committee member should take root among the masses, so that the masses could speak their minds and systematically investigate the rural situation. He also emphasized that they must share weal and woe with the masses, share their fate, and become one with them. After the meeting, County Party Secretary Zhao Yingzhou went down with his bag, and Deputy Secretary Chen and other committee members also went down. Now, under normal circumstances, thirteen or fourteen committee members can be kept, with two-thirds of their time spent in the countryside. Secretary Zhao is responsible for the overall work of the county, and he has to manage finance, economics, culture, education, politics, and law. However, he stayed in the home of a villager in Louxia Village, Xiling Township, for more than ten days, conducted an investigation of changes in the lives of the masses, understood the issue of hog production, investigated which sideline occupations suitable for individual management had been squeezed out, and investigated which crops would yield higher returns if planted in the autumn.

    Now, "taking root" among the masses and conducting direct investigations has almost become a system in Dongxiang County. On the basis of "taking root," "periodic migration" has been proposed. This is also based on practical experience. It is not good for a committee member to live in one place for a long time, as they may only see one side and not the whole picture. By living in several places, the understanding can be more comprehensive and the thinking can be more open. At the same time, the "periodic migration" of committee members can also be used to check and supervise each other. Now, "periodic migration" has initially achieved results.

### 在群众中“安家落户”

    在群众中“安家落户”
    本报记者　李连斌
    他是谁？
    去年夏末的一个下午，强烈的阳光照射着久晴不雨的大地。一个背着行李汗流浃背的人走向江西东乡县珀玕乡的优胜农业社。这个人有三十岁，清瘦的面孔上有一双明亮的眼睛。社员们在没有看清这位客人的面孔以前，猜不出是谁，只猜出他是一个干部。土地改革以后，除了中共县委一个宣传部长在他们村住过半个月外，其他的县区干部很少在他们村住上几天，都是一走一过，听一听干部汇报，传达一下上级的指示就走了。但是现在看见这个人带着行李，知道他不是“过路人”，而要在村里住上一个时期了。
    当这个客人走进村和农业社的办公室，社员和社干部们才发现他是县委副书记陈接福同志。
    “先住下再说吧！”
    陈副书记到优胜农业社办公室，正赶上社干部们在开社委会，研究抗旱和社的经营管理问题。社干部们根据经验，知道上边来的一些干部，总是有些“指示”“号召”要讲的，因此就对陈副书记说：
    “请你指示指示吧！”
    “我不了解情况，先住下再说吧！”陈副书记爽朗地回答。
    在这次会议上陈副书记偶而提出一个问题，插几句话，但没作过多的发言。
    会议结束的时候，已经是太阳欲坠西山的时候了。会后，他们给陈副书记在社的办公室里腾出一间最好的房子。可是陈副书记拒绝了。他说：
    “不要腾房子了，我到社员家里去住。”
    陈副书记了解了一下情况后，就决定到第二生产队去住了。
    优胜农业社处在丘陵地带，土地较贫瘠，人民生活水平较低。第二生产队的生活条件在这个社里又是最差的。当陈副书记到了第二生产队时，第二生产队长指给他一座青砖瓦房说：
    “这是我们队最好的一栋房子。房主是贫农，又是军属，到那里去住吧！”
    “房子好坏有什么关系，便于接近群众就行。”陈副书记不同意地说。最后他找到社员徐艾昌的土房子住下了。
    这件事，很快传开了。晚上，就有很多群众聚拢了来，问长问短，说东道西，表现很亲热。
    和群众打成一片
    陈副书记住在社员的家里，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动，天长日久和群众打成了一片。群众对待陈副书记像对待亲人一样，什么心里话都对他讲了。
    有一天，陈副书记和和平农业社的社员们一块铲草皮。在休息的时候就和社员们谈心，社员们谈到社副主任兼生产队长黎有生的强迫命令作风很严重，社员们都很怕他。大家还怀疑他有贪污行为，一个青年社员大胆把自己的怀疑对陈副书记说了。
    陈副书记又根据其他一些社员们的反映，责成总支书记组织了一个会计组进行检查，果然发现黎有生的贪污。这件事解决后，和陈副书记谈问题的群众更多了。有一天陈副书记在优胜社一个社员的家吃饭，陈副书记问他们生活情况。那个社员毫无顾虑地说：“没有菜吃。”陈副书记听了觉得很奇怪，又问：“为甚么？”“没有肥料。”“为甚么？”“人尿粪都归社了。”
    陈副书记在这次谈心中发现了社员们普遍关心的是自留地的肥料问题。后来把这个自留地的肥料问题提到社委会上解决了，决定人尿归社员自用，用不了作价归社。人粪由社委会按田数和人口统一调配。这样就保证了自留地的肥料，鼓舞了社员积肥的积极性。
    陈副书记重视群众的意见，对群众的意见总是虚心倾听。社员们说，他们向来有种萝卜的习惯，要求从社借用一部分田种萝卜。陈副书记研究了他们的要求，一亩田收成好了，可收一万斤萝卜；不但可以解决社员吃菜的问题，还可出卖一部分，增加社员的收入。叶子可以喂猪。最后和社干部商量抽出四十亩田交给社员种萝卜。群众的迫切要求解决了。
    陈副书记“安家落户”的结果，听到了群众的心里话。对农村政治、经济、生活、阶级情况作了一系列的考察，对正确指导农村工作起了很大的作用。
    他只是“安家落户”中的一个
    为什么陈副书记会到群众中去落户呢？在他下去之前，县委为了研究改进县委领导方法的问题，不知开了多少次会，虽然领导方法在逐步改进，但县委本身始终觉得不够满意。经过一段实践和较长时期的考虑，大家一致认为改进领导的关键是加强调查研究。但加强调查研究不知提过多少次，总是办不到。好像这是一个没有办法解决的老问题。经过委员们的讨论，最后由书记赵瀛洲同志作了总结。提出：每个委员都要在群众中安家，作到群众能讲知心话，系统地调查农村情况。并且强调必须和群众共甘苦同命运，和群众打成一片。会后县委书记赵瀛洲提着包袱下去了，陈副书记和其他委员也都下去了。现在，在一般的情况下，能保持十三、四个委员，三分之二的时间在农村。赵书记负责一个县的全面工作，财经、文教、政法等都要管，但他在西岭乡楼下村群众的家里住了十几天，作了群众生活变化的考察，了解了生猪生产问题，调查哪些适合个人经营的副业被挤掉了，调查秋种种甚么作物收益大等。
    现在在群众中“安家落户”，作直接调查，在东乡县几乎形成了一种制度。现在在“安家落户”的基础上又提出“定期迁移”。这也是根据实践经验提出来的。一个委员长期住在一个地方也不好，容易只看到一点看不到全面。多住几个地方，认识可以更全面，思路可以更开阔。同时，委员们“定期迁移”，也可以互相检查、互相监督。现在，“定期迁移”也初步收到了效果。
