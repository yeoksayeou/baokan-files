    Very Frank
    (A Short Interlude Comedy)
    Soviet Union, Wei Bakhnov, Ya. Goschukovsky
    A: We are about to begin our performance. But before the performance, I must remind you of one thing. There is a meeting tomorrow at ten o'clock in the morning, and we must attend. You haven't forgotten, have you?
    B: How could I forget! I also want to speak personally on a pressing issue at the meeting.
    A: What issue?
    B: I want to criticize those who are captured by friendship. You know, this kind of relationship hinders our cause, do you understand? It hinders principled criticism. Because of this relationship, we cover up the ugly things that exist in our work. Can we still tolerate this phenomenon now? Can we now...
    A: Please stop, stop. Who are you planning to speak about specifically?
    B: Ah, I have prepared a list. (Opens a large scroll) Look, take a look. For example, the Kukushkin brothers. Do you know them?
    A: Of course, I know them.
    B: You see, the elder Kukushkin knows that the younger Kukushkin is always late for work, but he keeps silent. May I ask, why is he silent? He is afraid of damaging the close relationship. I must say this at the meeting: "You are shameful, Comrade elder Kukushkin..."
    A: Which of them is older?
    B: Gorya.
    A: Which one did you stay with at the sanatorium?
    B: Ah, that's right, that's right... Hmm, indeed we stayed together... He is a good young man, a good friend... We fished together, played volleyball... (Ponders, then firmly) Give me a pencil! (Crosses out from the list) It's not entirely necessary to say him. (Looks at the list) Kurochkin also knows, also knows that the younger Kukushkin is late for work. But he also remains silent. Why is he silent? He is afraid of damaging the friendship. I must say this: "You are shameful, Comrade Kurochkin, you put friendship above the cause!"
    A: Right, right, correct. You seem to be neighbors with him?
    B: So what if we are neighbors! I don't care if he is a neighbor! Since he is an unprincipled person...
    A: But I think he is a very principled person. Yesterday I met him, and he spoke about you very objectively. (Tentatively) He said you are a very talented person.
    B: So what! Let him say it. Just let him say I am talented... Oh, wait a minute... Talented. He said that... Did he say that?
    A: That's exactly what he said.
    B: Give me a pencil! (Crosses out from the list) Let him say it! Anyway, I'm going to say this: "You are shameful, my dear Comrade Kurochkin..." Wait, when we have tea, I'm going to say that.
    A: You and him are going to have tea where? At the meeting?
    B: No, why make someone lose face in front of everyone? I'll invite him to my house to say it; we are neighbors. And at the meeting, I'd better criticize Zaitsev. If anyone is captured by friendship, it is Zaitsev.
    A: Right, but you know, it was out of friendship that he helped get your sister into college.
    B: (Recalling) Right, he really helped...
    A: Everyone knows this.
    B: (Happily) Everyone knows? That's great. In this case, there is no need to say him! Give me a pencil! (Crosses out from the list) I'd better severely reprimand Stepanov at the meeting.
    A: Correct, correct. Say him. This will further demonstrate your principle, because your wives are good friends.
    B: Ah?… (Firmly) Give me a pencil! Let them be friendly. (Crosses out from the list) Ah… (Looks at the list, lost) In the end, can't I say anyone? Ah?
    A: Then you simply don't need to speak.
    B: Not speak—people will say: silent out of friendship. Who is good to say? This is terrible! But, there is probably someone I can say!
    A: Of course, there always is. Then please talk about yourself.
    B: Talk about myself?!
    A: Yes, yes, precisely yourself. I just checked on you on purpose. I once again confirmed: you are stubbornly avoiding criticizing your friends.
    B: Regarding this, have you been paying attention to me?
    A: As long as I have known you—five years.
    B: That is to say, I have been afraid to criticize my colleagues for five years?
    A: Yes.
    B: Everything is starting from the sentimentalism of friendships?
    A: Exactly.
    B: Regarding this, you have already known for five years?
    A: Yes.
    B: (Happily) Thank you very much!
    A: Thank you for what?
    B: Thank you very much!
    A: Exactly why are you thanking me?
    B: Just for secretly telling me who is silent out of friendship among us; just because now I know who should be criticized I thank you.
    A: Criticize who?
    B: You, precisely you! You have known about my situation for five years and have not said it. And why are you silent? It is out of friendship! You are shameful, Comrade Petrov!

    非常坦率
    （幕间小型喜剧）
    苏联  维·巴赫诺夫  亚·高斯丘可夫斯基
    甲：我们现在就要开始我们的演出了。但在演出之前我要提醒您一件事情。明天上午十点钟有一个会议，我们一定要参加的，您不会忘了吧？
    乙：我怎么能忘哪！我还要在会议上就一个紧迫问题亲自发言呢。
    甲：什么问题呀？
    乙：我想批评一下那些被朋友关系所俘掳的人们。要知道，这种关系妨碍着我们的事业，您明白吗，妨碍着原则性的批评。由于这种关系就掩饰了我们工作中存在的那些丑恶事情。到现在我们还能容忍这种现象吗？到现在我们……
    甲：请停一下，停一下，您打算具体地说谁呢？
    乙：啊，我已准备好了一个名单。（打开一个大纸卷）瞧，请看吧，例如库库什金弟兄。您认识他们吗？
    甲：当然认识。
    乙：你看，大库库什金知道小库库什金老是上班迟到，可是他不声不响。请问，他为什么沉默呢？他是害怕破坏了亲密的关系。我在会议上一定要这样说：“你真可耻，大库库什金同志……”。
    甲：他们俩谁大呀？
    乙：高里亚。
    甲：您是和哪一个一起在休养所呆过的？
    乙：啊，对了对了……嗯，确实一起呆过……他真是一个好小伙子，是个可交的……我们一起钓过鱼，打过排球……（沉思着，随后坚定地）请给我铅笔！（从名单上涂抹去了）完全不必要一定说他。（瞧着名单）库洛奇根也知道，也知道小库库什金上班迟到。可是他也沉默着。为什么沉默呢？他是害怕破坏朋友的关系。我一定这样说：“你真可耻，库洛奇根同志，你把朋友关系放在事业之上！”
    甲：对对，正确。您同他好像是邻居吧？
    乙：那怎么着？我管他邻居不邻居哪！既然他是一个无原则的人……
    甲：而我倒觉得他是个很有原则的人。昨天我遇到了他，他很客观地谈到了您。（试探地）他说您是一位很有才干的人哪。
    乙：那怎么样！让他说去吧。就让他说我有才干吧……唉呀，等一下……有才干的。他说来着……是这样说过吗？
    甲：就是这样说的。
    乙：请给我铅笔！（从名单上涂抹去了）让他说去吧！反正我要这样说：“您真可耻，我亲爱的库洛奇根同志……”，回头，等我们喝茶时，我就要这样说。
    甲：您和他到哪儿去喝茶呀？在会议上吗？
    乙：不是，为什么当着大伙的面让一个人丢脸哪？我请他到家里去说，我们是邻居呀。而在会议上我最好是批评查依切夫。如果说谁是被朋友关系所俘掳了，那就是查依切夫。
    甲：对呀，但是要知道，正是出于朋友的情面他才帮助把您的妹妹安置在大学里呢。
    乙：（回忆着）对对，真是他帮了忙……
    甲：大家都晓得这件事情。
    乙：（高兴地）大家都晓得？那好极了。在这种情况下就没必要说他了！请给我铅笔！（从名单上涂抹去了）我最好是在会议上把斯切潘诺夫严厉地斥责一顿。
    甲：正确，正确。就说他。这更加表现您有原则性，因为你们两人的妻子是好朋友哇。
    乙：啊？……（坚定地）请给我铅笔！还是让她们友好吧。（从名单上涂抹去了）啊……（看着名单，茫然若失地）结果这不是谁也说不成了吗？啊？
    甲：那您干脆就不用发言了。
    乙：不发言——人家会说：碍于朋友的情面而沉默。到底说谁好呢？真糟！不过，大概总有个什么人可以说的吧！
    甲：那当然啦，总是有的。就请说说您自己吧。
    乙：说我自己？！
    甲：是，是呀，正是您自己。我刚才就专门检查了您。我又一次证实了：您是顽强地逃避批评自己的朋友的。
    乙：关于这一点，您早就在注意我吗？
    甲：和我同您认识一样久——五年了。
    乙：这就是说，我害怕批评自己的同事有五年了？
    甲：是呀。
    乙：一切都是从朋友的情面出发吗？
    甲：正是。
    乙：关于这一点，您已经知道有五年了吗？
    甲：是呀。
    乙：（高兴地）很感谢您！
    甲：谢什么呀？
    乙：大大地谢谢您！
    甲：到底为什么谢我呀？
    乙：就为您暗地里告诉了我，在我们这里谁是碍于朋友情面而沉默着；就为现在我才知道了应该批评谁而感谢您。
    甲：批评谁呀？
    乙：您哪，正是您哪！您知道我这个情况已经有五年了都没有说过。而为什么沉默呢？是碍于朋友的情面！您真可耻，彼得洛夫同志！
