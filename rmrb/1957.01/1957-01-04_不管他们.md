    Never Mind Them
    A bureau director in a certain department, during a political theory study meeting for cadres, introduced his personal understanding of the “Eighth National Congress” documents. When discussing political life, he repeatedly emphasized opposing all kinds of bureaucracy and implementing the principle of democratic centralism in work. The bureau director talked for two whole hours, and still hadn’t finished sharing his understanding.
    One day, the bureau director went to Director ×'s office.
    Director ×: Among the comrades being transferred to us, 80% of them have objections to the establishment of this new organization. They believe that the guiding principles and tasks are unclear, the work is empty, and the organizations overlap…
    Bureau Director: Didn't you talk to those who have objections?
    Director ×: I did. I talked for a long time, but it didn't seem to work on them. They still don't think it's necessary for us to establish this organization, and they also have many opinions and questions about the scope of responsibilities and work tasks we've proposed.
    Bureau Director: Never mind them.
    Director ×: If we don't get their thinking straightened out, they won't be able to do a good job after they come.
    Bureau Director: Never mind them.
    Director ×: But some of the opinions they raise are correct.
    Bureau Director: Never mind them!

    不管他们
    某部一局长在干部政治理论学习会上，介绍个人学习“八大”文件心得，谈到政治生活问题时，一而再地强调反对各样各色的官僚主义，在工作中要贯彻民主集中制原则。局长整整谈了两个多钟头，也没有谈完他的心得。
    一天，局长来到×处长的办公室。
    处长：在我们准备调来的同志当中，有80％的同志对我们成立这个新机构有意见，认为方针任务不明、工作空洞、机构重叠……
    局长：你没找那些有意见的谈谈话吗？
    处长：谈过了。我谈了半天，对他们好像不起作用，他们始终不表示我们有必要成立这个机构，同时对我们提出的职责范围、工作任务还提出很多的意见和疑问。
    局长：不管他们。
    处长：如果不打通他们的思想，来了以后，工作也搞不好呵。
    局长：不管他们。
    处长：可是他们提的意见有些是正确的。
    局长：不管他们！
