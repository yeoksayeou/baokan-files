    The Mollet Government Continues to Act Rashly in Algeria
    Xu Ba
    After the shameful failure of the French Socialist government's military intervention in Egypt, it is preparing to strengthen colonial suppression in Algeria. On January 9, Mollet's "Declaration of Intent" on the Algerian issue at a press conference in Paris indicated that he "would never give up Algeria."
    It seems that the Mollet government has not learned the lessons it should have from this dirty war in Algeria. After taking office, the Mollet government abandoned its promise of a peaceful resolution to the Algerian issue and pursued a policy of armed suppression in Algeria. In October of last year, the Mollet government also shamefully kidnapped five Algerian national leaders in an attempt to weaken the Algerian national liberation movement. However, despite this, France's situation in Algeria is becoming increasingly difficult. Two years ago, the Algerian war zone was limited to the Aurès Mountains, but now it has spread to most of Algeria. Even in Algiers, the seat of the French colonial authorities, military operations are increasing month by month: 23 in April last year, 33 in May, 56 in June, 44 in July, 95 in August, and 114 in September. By late October, the French Governor-General of Algeria, Lacoste, even worried that Algiers might be briefly occupied by the National Liberation Army. The fact is clear: the Algerian people, fighting for national independence, will never bow down to force; it is impossible for France to maintain its colonial rule by means of suppression.
    The colonial war in Algeria has brought serious difficulties to the French economy. At the beginning of last year, the military expenditure in Algeria was set at 200 billion francs, but in reality, 485 billion francs have already been spent. In order to make up for the financial deficit caused by the heavy military expenditure, the Mollet government has, on the one hand, adopted the method of increasing taxes and issuing public bonds, which has imposed a heavy burden on the working people; on the other hand, it has issued a large number of banknotes, causing serious consequences of inflation and soaring prices. Therefore, in the second half of last year, the franc had fallen to its lowest price in the free market in three years. This situation has led the European Economic Cooperation Administration to warn that if the French government does not strictly control the inflation situation, the French economy will face a serious crisis.
    France's insistence on its colonial policy in Algeria has been condemned by world opinion, placing it in an unprecedentedly isolated position in the international community. The French Governor-General of Algeria, Lacoste, once sadly admitted that France's military actions in Algeria have been met with "opposition from almost the entire world." Especially after the French government kidnapped the Algerian national leaders, the broad masses of people in Asia and Africa have lodged solemn protests. Under these circumstances, France's relations with Morocco and Tunisia are also becoming increasingly tense. Tunisian Prime Minister Bourguiba pointed out that France's actions may "force the entire North Africa to contend with France."
    In order to save itself from failure, the Mollet government, after Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, attempted to strike a blow at the Algerian national liberation struggle through armed intervention in Egypt. However, their plan failed again. The military operations in Egypt suffered a shameful defeat, bringing only heavy disasters to France. The oil shortage has greatly affected the production of many important industrial sectors in France, and the crisis in French finance and economy has deepened. World opinion has condemned France as an aggressor, and even the leader of the British Labour Party, Attlee, has called the French Socialist government the most reactionary bastion of colonialism.
    Within France, the voice against armed suppression in Algeria is also growing louder. The French Communists resolutely advocate safeguarding the Algerian people's right to self-determination and constantly mobilize the masses to fight to stop the "dirty war" in Algeria. In May of last year, Radical Socialist Party leader Mendès France resigned from the government because he opposed Mollet's Algerian policy. At the National Congress of the Radical Socialist Party in October last year, many representatives sharply criticized the Socialist government's Algerian policy. Within the Socialist Party, there is also widespread dissatisfaction. On November 24 last year, 25 Socialist parliamentarians and provincial and municipal councilors wrote to the party leadership, saying that the Socialist "government is able to exist entirely on the votes of the right wing, and in the future it will be a prisoner of the right wing. Although the voters initially received the promise of achieving peace in Algeria, although the party now also demands it, the war in Algeria continues, and all negotiations have been consistently rejected." In addition, Philippe, a member of the Socialist Party's Steering Committee, and many provincial organizations of the Socialist Party have criticized Mollet's Algerian policy.
    In order to maintain its precarious position, the Mollet government, regardless of domestic and foreign opposition and accusations, has turned back to grab the Algerian issue as a lifeline in order to obtain the support of the French right-wing forces. While singing the tune of "reform" and "negotiation," it is also arranging to expand the dirty war in Algeria.
    What exactly is the Mollet government's so-called "reform"? According to Western news agencies, the Mollet government has drafted a plan that will allow Algeria a great deal of administrative and legislative autonomy, stipulate arbitration procedures in the event of disagreements between Algeria and France, and require accelerated land reform and the establishment of new municipal institutions in which both Muslim and European residents participate. This kind of plan is nothing new. In 1945 and 1947, France also carried out so-called "reforms" in Algeria, shouting loudly about giving Islamic residents "suffrage" and establishing consultative parliaments. However, the result of these two so-called "reforms" was that eight million Muslims could only elect the same number of parliamentarians as one million European residents, and the French Governor-General's privileges and a series of complex procedures made the so-called "consultative parliament" unable to play any role at all. This "reform" is just a replica of the previous "reforms," and its purpose is only to keep the Islamic residents of Algeria living under the shackles of colonialism. As for "negotiations," they are even more of an empty promise. The Mollet government is unwilling to recognize the Algerian people's right to independence and even refuses to recognize the representatives of the Algerian National Liberation Front as negotiating partners. Then who will it negotiate with? And what is there to negotiate? Moreover, the tune of this so-called "reform" and "negotiation" is so inconsistent with what the Mollet government is actually doing. According to French officials, the French troops stationed in North Africa have increased to 650,000, more than double the number when the Mollet government took office. This year's French military expenditure will also be 60 billion francs more than last year.
    The Mollet government's intensification of suppression against the Algerian people while singing the tune of "reform" and "negotiation" has its own intentions, because, on the one hand, after France's military intervention in Egypt failed, the Algerian people's struggle for national liberation has strengthened, and the French colonial army has suffered increasingly heavy blows. Therefore, it is attempting to use the deceptive means of "reform" and "negotiation" to ease the Algerian people's fighting spirit. On the other hand, the United Nations General Assembly will soon discuss the Algerian issue. As the world's anti-colonial forces are growing stronger, France can no longer obstruct the discussion by means of abstaining from the meeting as it did at the last session of the General Assembly. Therefore, it wants to use some tricks to deal with world opinion.
    However, this clumsy trick cannot deceive anyone. After Mollet issued the "Declaration of Intent" on the Algerian issue, the representatives of the Algerian National Liberation Front announced on January 11 that France must first recognize Algeria's independence in order to achieve a ceasefire; otherwise, the Algerian people will continue to fight for national independence until this goal is fully realized. Representatives of Asian and African countries have solemnly condemned France's policy of suppression in Algeria during the general debate of the UN General Assembly. France will inevitably be subjected to even more severe criticism when the Algerian issue is discussed.
    The Mollet government continues to act rashly in Algeria, but the future outcome will not be favorable to the French colonialists. Not long ago, some French newspapers talked about the day when France would encounter a "second Dien Bien Phu." Does the French government really have to wait until that day to soberly address the Algerian people's demands for independence?

    摩勒政府还要在阿尔及利亚蛮干下去
    徐拔
    法国的社会党政府在对埃及的军事干涉遭到可耻的失败以后，又准备在阿尔及利亚加强殖民镇压了。1月9日摩勒在巴黎记者招待会上发表了法国政府关于阿尔及利亚问题的“意图宣言”，就表示“决不放弃阿尔及利亚”。
    看来，摩勒政府还没有从阿尔及利亚这场肮脏战争中取得应有的教训。摩勒政府在上台以后，抛弃了关于和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的诺言，而在阿尔及利亚执行了武装镇压的政策；在去年10月，摩勒政府还可耻地绑架了五位阿尔及利亚民族领袖，企图借此削弱阿尔及利亚民族解放运动的力量。但是，尽管这样，法国在阿尔及利亚的处境还是越来越困难了。两年前，阿尔及利亚的战区还局限在奥雷斯山区，而目前已经扩展到大半个阿尔及利亚。甚至在法国殖民当局的驻在地阿尔及尔市，军事行动也逐月增加：去年4月份是二十三起，5月份是三十三起，6月份是五十六起，7月份是四十四起，8月份是九十五起，9月份则达到一百十四起；到10月下旬，法国驻阿尔及利亚总督拉戈斯特甚至耽心地说，阿尔及尔市可能会被民族解放军短时间地占领。事实很清楚，为了民族独立而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民决不会在武力面前低头的；法国想用镇压手段来维持殖民统治是行不通的。
    在阿尔及利亚的殖民战争，给法国的经济带来了严重的困难。去年年初，阿尔及利亚的军费开支规定为两千亿法郎，而现在实际上已经花了四千八百五十亿法郎。为了弥补由于沉重的军费开支所造成的财政赤字，摩勒政府一方面采取了增加赋税和发行公债的办法，使劳动人民承受了沉重的负担；另一方面又大量发行纸币，造成了通货膨胀和物价飞涨的严重恶果。因此，在去年下半年，法郎在自由市场上已经下降到三年来的最低价格。这种情况使欧洲经济合作局也提出警告说，如果法国政府对通货膨胀的情况再不加以严格控制，就会使法国经济面临严重的危机。
    法国在阿尔及利亚坚持殖民政策，已经受到世界舆论的谴责，使它在国际上处于空前孤立的地位。法国驻阿尔及利亚总督拉戈斯特就曾经悲哀地承认：法国在阿尔及利亚的军事行动遭到了“几乎全世界的反对”。特别是在法国政府绑架了阿尔及利亚民族领袖以后，亚非地区的广大人民纷纷提出了严正的抗议。在这种情况下，法国同摩洛哥和突尼斯的关系也日趋紧张。突尼斯首相布尔吉巴指出，法国的这种做法可能“迫使整个北非同法国较量力量。”
    摩勒政府为了挽救自己的失败，在埃及宣布把苏伊士运河公司收归国有以后，就企图通过对埃及的武装干涉来打击阿尔及利亚的民族解放斗争。但是，他们的打算又落空了。在埃及进行的军事行动遭到了可耻的失败，给法国带来的只是沉重的灾难。石油荒使得法国很多重要的工业部门生产大受影响，法国财政经济的危机加深了。全世界的舆论都谴责法国是侵略者，连英国工党的领袖艾德礼也把法国的社会党政府叫做最反动的殖民主义堡垒。
    在法国国内，反对在阿尔及利亚进行武装镇压的呼声也越来越高了。法国共产党人坚决主张维护阿尔及利亚人民的自决权利，并且不断动员群众为制止在阿尔及利亚的“肮脏战争”而斗争。去年5月，激进社会党的领袖孟戴斯—弗朗斯因为反对摩勒的阿尔及利亚政策而退出了政府。激进社会党在去年10月举行的全国代表大会上，许多代表尖锐地指责社会党政府的阿尔及利亚政策。在社会党内，同样弥漫着不满情绪。去年11月24日，二十五名社会党议员和省、市政委员写信给党的领导说：社会党“政府所以能存在完全是靠右翼的选票，今后它会是右翼的俘虏。当初选民虽然得到了在阿尔及利亚实现和平的诺言，虽然党现在也要求这样做，可是阿尔及利亚的战争仍然在继续下去，所有的谈判一贯遭到拒绝。”此外，社会党指导委员会委员菲利普以及社会党的许多省组织都批评了摩勒的阿尔及利亚政策。
    为了维持自己摇摇欲坠的地位，摩勒政府不顾国内外的反对和指责，又回过头来抓住阿尔及利亚问题作为救生草，以此来取得法国右翼势力对它的支持。他一面高唱起“改革”和“谈判”的调子，一面又布置着要扩大阿尔及利亚的肮脏战争。
    摩勒政府的所谓“改革”究竟是什么呢？据西方通讯社报道，摩勒政府已经拟订了一个计划，这个计划将允许阿尔及利亚有很大的行政权和立法自治权，规定了在阿尔及利亚和法国之间发生分歧时的仲裁程序，并且要求加速实行土地改革以及建立由穆斯林和欧洲籍居民都参加的新的市政机构。这一类的计划已经不是什么新东西了。在1945年和1947年，法国也在阿尔及利亚进行过所谓“改革”，大叫大嚷说要给伊斯兰居民以“选举权”和建立咨询性议会。但是，这两次所谓“改革”的结果是：八百万穆斯林只能和一百万欧洲籍居民选出同样数目的议员，而且法国总督的特权和一连串复杂的程序又使所谓“咨询性的议会”根本不能起什么作用。这一次的“改革”也不过是上几次“改革”的翻版，其目的只是使阿尔及利亚的伊斯兰居民仍然生活在殖民主义的镣铐下。至于“谈判”更是一张空头支票。摩勒政府根本不愿承认阿尔及利亚人民的独立权利，甚至还拒绝把阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的代表作为谈判对象。那末它将跟谁去谈判呢？又有什么可以谈判的呢？而且，这种所谓“改革”和“谈判”的调子，同摩勒政府实际上在干的勾当是显得那末不协调。据法国官方人士宣布：法国驻在北非的军队已经增加到六十五万人，比摩勒政府上台时多了一倍多。今年法国的军费也要比去年多六百亿法郎。
    摩勒政府之所以要在对阿尔及利亚人民加强镇压的同时唱起“改革”和“谈判”的调子，是有它的用意的，因为，一方面，在法国对埃及的军事干涉失败以后，阿尔及利亚人民争取民族解放的斗争加强了，法国殖民军队受到的打击越来越沉重，因此它就企图用“改革”和“谈判”的欺骗手段来缓和阿尔及利亚人民的斗争情绪。另一方面，联合国大会不久就要讨论阿尔及利亚问题，由于世界反殖民主义的力量越来越壮大，法国已经不能像在上一届联大那样用退席的办法来阻挠讨论，因此就想施出一些手段来应付世界舆论。
    但是，这种拙劣的障眼法是不能骗过什么人的。在摩勒发表了关于阿尔及利亚问题的“意图宣言”后，阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的代表已经在1月11日宣布，法国必须首先承认阿尔及利亚的独立，才能实现停火；否则，阿尔及利亚人民将继续为民族独立而战斗，直到完全实现这个目标为止。亚非各国的代表在联大一般性辩论时已经严正地谴责了法国对阿尔及利亚的镇压政策，在讨论阿尔及利亚问题时法国必将受到更猛烈的抨击。
    摩勒政府还要在阿尔及利亚蛮干下去，但是未来的结局是不会有利于法国殖民主义者的。不久以前，法国的一些报刊曾经谈论过法国将在那一天碰到“第二个奠边府”的问题。难道法国政府真要等到这一天才能清醒地来对待阿尔及利亚人民的独立要求吗？
