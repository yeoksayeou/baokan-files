Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch from London: The British government, having suffered defeat in the war of aggression against Egypt, has expressed satisfaction with the new plan for aggression against Middle Eastern countries proposed by Eisenhower in his message to Congress on the Middle East issue on the 5th.

A British government spokesman said on the evening of the 5th that Britain "welcomes" Eisenhower's "intention" expressed in the message to use American resources to "support" the so-called "security" and "development" of Middle Eastern countries.

London diplomatic observers believe that the "satisfaction" expressed by the British government regarding Eisenhower's message indicates that Britain hopes to unite with the United States to implement this new policy. They pointed out that Britain has already established treaty relations with some countries in the Middle East and possesses important military bases, which can provide "valuable support" for the United States.

At the same time, London diplomatic circles and some British newspapers expressed skepticism about Eisenhower's blatant clamoring for the so-called "preventing Soviet threats" in the message. They believe that the root of the current Middle East crisis lies in the "Palestine" issue and the so-called "Suez Canal" issue, not the "threat of Communist military aggression."

The "Sunday Telegraph," which supports Britain's policy of aggression against Egypt, commented on the intention of the new American policy, saying that the "Eisenhower Plan" is merely intended to "have the United States take over the Western leadership in the Middle East from Britain."

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: A French Foreign Ministry spokesman stated at a press conference on the 4th that he welcomes the "Eisenhower Doctrine" that the United States intends to promote in the Middle East, because the United States seems to have recognized "the extreme importance of the Middle East in the defense of the free world," a point that Britain and France have long hoped to prove to it. At the same time, the spokesman stated that France believes that the United Nations is the most appropriate institution to be used to resolve the Middle East issue.

### 禁脔将失去　无奈求残羹  英法官方奉承“艾森豪威尔主义”

    禁脔将失去　无奈求残羹
    英法官方奉承“艾森豪威尔主义”
    据新华社6日讯　伦敦消息：在侵略埃及战争中遭受失败的英国政府，对艾森豪威尔在5日致国会的中东问题咨文中提出的侵略中东国家的新计划表示满意。
    英国政府发言人5日晚间说，英国“欢迎”艾森豪威尔在咨文中所表明的要用美国资源来“支持”中东国家的所谓“安全”和“发展”的“打算”。
    伦敦外交观察家认为，英国官方对艾森豪威尔咨文所表示的“满意”，是表明英国希望同美国联合起来实行这个新政策。他们指出，英国已经在中东同一些国家建立条约关系并且拥有重要的军事基地，这就能为美国提供“有价值的支持”。
    同时，伦敦外交界人士和英国某些报纸对艾森豪威尔在咨文里大肆叫嚣的所谓“防止苏联威胁”表示怀疑。他们认为，目前中东危机的根源是“巴勒斯坦”问题和所谓“苏伊士运河”问题，而不是“共产党军事进攻的威胁”。
    支持英国侵埃政策的“星期电讯报”谈到美国这项新政策的意图说，“艾森豪威尔计划”不过是要使“美国从英国手里把西方在中东的领导势力接收过来”罢了。
    据新华社讯　法国外交部发言人4日在记者招待会上表示，他欢迎美国打算在中东推行的“艾森豪威尔主义”，因为美国看来已经承认“中东在自由世界防务上的极端重要性”，而这一点是英国和法国早就希望向它证明的。同时，这个发言人表示，法国认为联合国是被利用来解决中东问题的最适当的机构。
