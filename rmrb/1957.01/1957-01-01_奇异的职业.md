    Strange Occupations
    A physiologist at the University of Chicago, in order to test human digestive power, hired a person to specifically swallow small metal balls, glass beads, balls of thread, and other hard-to-digest items. As a result, this person hired for the experiment suffered from severe gastrointestinal problems. However, in the United States, some people have to engage in this strange occupation. ×××
    The New York Grand Theater hires people whose job is to specifically applaud actors who are making their debut on stage. The leader who initiates the audience's applause receives a weekly salary of twenty pounds, while those who echo the cheers receive a weekly salary of five pounds. This kind of "cheering" profession is not only found in theaters but also in cinemas. In cinemas, they specifically provide "artificial" applause for newly released films that are being shown for the first time.

    纽约大剧院雇用一种人，他们的职业是专门给初上台的戏子喝采。其中带头引起观众喝采的领班周薪二十英镑，附和呐喊者周薪五英镑。这种专门从事“捧场”职业的人不独剧院有，电影院也有。在电影院则专对初次上映的新影片作“人工”的喝采。
