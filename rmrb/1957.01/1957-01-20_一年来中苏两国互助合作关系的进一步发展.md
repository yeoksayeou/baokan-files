    1956 was a year of further development in the mutual assistance and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in the political, economic, and cultural fields.
    In this year, China and the Soviet Union signed eleven important agreements. China sent a total of 95 delegations and study groups to the Soviet Union, comprising 1,242 people. The Soviet Union sent a total of 77 delegations and study groups to China at the invitation of China, comprising 762 people.
    These friendly exchanges not only further strengthened the unbreakable and eternal fraternal friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, but also once again proved the Soviet Union's generous and selfless assistance to China's socialist construction.
    In April, the Soviet government delegation headed by Soviet First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Mikoyan, signed two agreements with China during its visit: one was the Agreement on Soviet Assistance to China in Developing Certain Industrial Sectors. The agreement stipulated that the Soviet Union would help China build 55 new industrial enterprises, increasing the number of industrial projects that the Soviet Union was helping China build from the original 156 to 211. The other was the Agreement on the Construction of a Railway from Lanzhou, China, to the Aktogay Station on the Turkestan-Siberia Railway in the Soviet Union, and on the Organization of Joint Transport on This Railway from 1960. The construction of this railway will play a huge role in the economic and cultural development of Northwest China.
    The railway from Jining to Ulaanbaatar, built according to the agreement signed by China, Mongolia, and the Soviet Union on September 15, 1952, began international joint transport on January 1, 1956. The opening of this railway shortened the distance from Beijing to Moscow by 1,100 kilometers. On December 2, the direct Beijing-Moscow-Prague jet passenger service officially opened, shortening the flight time from Beijing to Moscow to eight hours. This will play a huge role in the development of China's socialist construction.
    In the cultural field, the China-Soviet Cultural Cooperation Agreement and the 1956 Cultural Cooperation Implementation Plan were signed in Moscow in July 1956, strengthening the planning and purpose of cultural cooperation between the two countries. Over the past year, China sent a total of 29 cultural delegations and art troupes to the Soviet Union, comprising 453 people; a total of 1,836 undergraduates and graduate students were sent to the Soviet Union for study; the Soviet Union sent a total of 11 cultural delegations and art troupes to China at the invitation of China, comprising more than 100 people. The Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction held in China from October 1954 to July 1956 was visited by 11.25 million people. The Soviet Union donated 83 machines, 700 exhibits, and all the exhibits from the Labor Reserve Pavilion to relevant departments in China. In this year, the two countries held film weeks with each other. The "Chinese Film Week" was held in Moscow, Leningrad, and the capitals of the various Union republics from early October to July 7. Starting from November 7, China held the "Soviet Film Week" in twenty cities. Soviet films were warmly welcomed by Chinese audiences. In ten cities including Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin alone, there were 2.7 million viewers.
    The scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries has also made great progress. The fourth and fifth sessions of the China-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee were held in 1956, and many resolutions were passed on further expanding scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries. Of particular importance was the establishment of direct links between the academies of sciences and scientific research institutions of the two countries. In April and May, the Soviet Union sent delegations of advanced producers in various professional fields to attend the National Congress of Advanced Producers in China, and after the meeting, they went to various places to impart advanced technical experience.
    In order to help China develop its scientific undertakings, the Soviet government specially dispatched outstanding experts to help China formulate a long-term plan for the development of science and technology, and to help China develop research work on the peaceful use of atomic energy. The Soviet Exhibition of Science and Technology for the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy was held in Beijing from June 15 to August 15. During the exhibition, the number of visitors reached 200,000. It not only enabled the Chinese people to understand the brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union in the peaceful use of atomic energy, but also promoted the strengthening of research on the peaceful use of atomic energy by the Chinese scientific community.
    China and the Soviet Union have done a lot of work in mutually receiving expert inspections and exchanging industrial and agricultural experiences. The Soviet Union sent experts and delegations to China to inspect the cultivation of crops, the prevention and control of highly infectious diseases, water conservancy construction, medicine, astronomy, and other research work, and to learn about China's acupuncture therapy, etc. China also sent experts and delegations to the Soviet Union to inspect the experience and achievements of the metallurgical, coal, petroleum, construction, and other departments. This year, China and the Soviet Union also signed an agreement on the joint investigation and comprehensive utilization of the natural resources of the Heilongjiang River basin.
    Over the past year, the Soviet Union has sent many medical experts to help China carry out medical research and train specialized physicians for China. The Soviet Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies handed over three hospitals in Lushun-Dalian, Yining, and Urumqi to the local Chinese governments free of charge in April 1956. The two sides also exchanged many delegations and study groups in the fields of health, education, and sports.

    一年来中苏两国互助合作关系的进一步发展
    1956年是中苏两国在政治、经济、文化各方面的互助合作关系进一步发展的一年。
    在这一年里，中苏签订了十一个重要协定，我国派赴苏联的各种代表团、考察团共九十五起、一千二百四十二人。苏联应邀访问我国的各种代表团、考察团共七十七起，七百六十二人。
    这些友好的往来不仅进一步加强了中苏两国人民间的牢不可破的、永恒的兄弟友谊，同时也再一次证明了苏联对我国社会主义建设的慷慨无私的援助。
    4月间以苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬为首的苏联政府代表团在访问我国期间同我国签订了两项协定：一个是关于苏联援助我国发展某些工业部门的协定。协定规定苏联帮助我国建设五十五个新的工业企业。苏联帮助我国建设的工业项目由原来的一百五十六项增加到二百一十一项。另一个是关于修建从中国兰州至苏联的土尔克斯坦—西伯利亚铁路上阿克斗卡站的铁路和从1960年组织这条铁路联运的协定。这条铁路的修建对于发展我国西北地区的经济文化建设将起着巨大的作用。
    根据1952年9月15日中、蒙、苏三国签订的协定修建的集宁到乌兰巴托的铁路，已在1956年1月1日开始了国际联运，这条铁路的通车，使北京到莫斯科的距离缩短了一千一百公里。12月2日北京——莫斯科——布拉格直达喷气客机正式开航，北京——莫斯科的航行时间缩短为八小时。这对于发展我国社会主义建设事业将起巨大作用。
    在文化方面，1956年7月间在莫斯科签订了中苏文化合作协定和1956年文化合作执行计划，加强了两国文化合作方面的计划性和目的性。一年来，我国派赴苏联的文化代表团、艺术团共二十九起，四百五十三人；派赴苏联学习的大学生和研究生共一千八百三十六人；苏联应邀访问中国的文化代表团、艺术团共十一起，一百多人。1954年10月到1956年7月在我国举办的苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会，观众人数达一千一百二十五万人。苏联将展品中的八十三件机器、七百件展品和劳动后备馆的全部展品赠送给我国有关部门。在这一年里，两国相互举办了电影周，10月初至7日在莫斯科、列宁格勒和各加盟共和国的首都举办了“中国电影周”。11月7日起我国在二十个城市举办了“苏联电影周”。苏联电影受到我国观众的热烈欢迎。仅北京、上海、天津等十个城市就有观众二百七十万人。
    两国的科学技术合作事业也有了很大的发展。1956年中苏科学技术合作委员会召开了第四、五届会议，通过了许多有关进一步扩大两国科学和技术合作的决议，其中特别重要的是建立了两国科学院和科学研究机关的直接联系。4、5月间苏联派出了各种专业方面的先进生产者代表团出席我全国先进生产者代表会议，会后并且到各地传授先进技术经验。
    为了帮助我国发展科学事业，苏联政府特别派遣了优秀的专家来帮助我国制订发展科学技术的远景规划，并且帮助我国发展和平利用原子能的研究工作。6月15日至8月15日在北京举行了苏联和平利用原子能科学技术展览会。展出期间参观人数达二十万人之多。它不仅使我国人民了解了苏联在和平利用原子能方面的光辉成就，并且促进我国科学界加强对和平利用原子能的研究。
    中苏两国在相互接待专家考察和交流工农业经验方面作了许多工作。苏联派遣了专家和代表团来中国考察农作物的栽培、烈性传染病的防治、水利建设、医药、天文等方面的研究工作，学习我国的针灸疗法等。我国也派遣了专家和代表团到苏联考察冶金、煤炭、石油、建筑等部门的经验和成就。这一年，中苏两国还签订了一项由双方共同调查和综合利用黑龙江流域自然资源的协定。
    一年来，苏联派遣许多医学专家帮助我国进行医学研究工作，并且为我国培养了专科化医师。苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会在1956年4月把设在旅大、伊宁和乌鲁木齐的三所医院无偿地移交我国当地政府。双方还互相派出了许多卫生、教育、体育等方面的代表团和考察团。　（新华社）
