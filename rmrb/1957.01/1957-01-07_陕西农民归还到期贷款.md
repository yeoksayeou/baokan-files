    Shaanxi Farmers Return Overdue Loans
    (Our report) Farmers in various parts of Shaanxi Province are actively returning overdue loans from state banks and credit cooperatives. As of the end of November 1956, according to incomplete statistics from the Shaanxi Branch of the People's Bank of China, the total amount of overdue loans recovered in the province reached more than 23 billion yuan.
    Since the start of the spring ploughing season last year, People's Banks and credit cooperatives in various parts of Shaanxi have issued large amounts of loans to help agricultural cooperatives and individual farmers in difficulty to solve problems in production and life. Therefore, when the loans became due, many agricultural cooperatives and individual farmers actively and enthusiastically repaid the overdue loans.
    In order to facilitate the repayment of overdue loans by farmers, People's Banks and credit cooperatives in various parts of Shaanxi generally adopted mobile service methods.
    However, at present, some cadres in banks and credit cooperatives do not sufficiently recognize the important significance of recovering overdue loans, which has made the progress of recovering overdue loans very slow. (An Wenbo)

    陕西农民归还到期贷款
    本报讯　陕西省各地农民积极归还国家银行和信用合作社的到期贷款。截至1956年11月底为止，据中国人民银行陕西省分行不完全的统计，全省收回的到期贷款已达二百三十多亿元。
    去年春耕开始以后，陕西各地的人民银行和信用合作社，曾先后发放了大批贷款，帮助有困难的农业社和个体农民解决了生产、生活上的困难。因此，当贷款到期时，很多农业社和个体农民都积极热情地归还到期贷款。
    为了给予农民归还到期贷款的方便，陕西各地人民银行和信用社一般都采取了流动服务的办法。
    但是，目前还有些银行和信用社的干部，对收回到期贷款的重要意义认识不足，因而使收回到期贷款的工作进度非常迟缓。（安文波）
