    One Day in Savannakhet
    By Our Correspondent Zhan Chao

    On my fifth day in Laos, Vice Minister of Propaganda of the Kingdom Government, Thong Sothi Phommasane, invited me to visit his hometown, Savannakhet. Mr. Phommasane had accompanied Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma on a visit to China and was deeply impressed. This time, he took advantage of the parliamentary recess to accompany his wife home for a visit, and also brought with him a documentary film from the Beijing Film Studio about the visit of the Lao Royal Government delegation to China, to be screened there.

    The plane left Vientiane and flew over the Khorat Plateau in Thailand. After an hour and a few minutes, it landed safely at Seno Airport. It was another thirty-five kilometers from the airport to Savannakhet city. We waited in the waiting room for more than half an hour for a car. Looking out the window of the waiting room, we could see many French soldiers working shirtless next to the airport. Nearby were rows of barracks surrounded by barbed wire. Mr. Phommasane looked at them for a long time, then turned to me and said, "Geneva." He seemed to be saying that, according to the Geneva Accords, France could only retain its last base here, and the Lao Royal Government had the right to demand its withdrawal if it deemed necessary. Later, I heard that a large part of the more than 3,000 French soldiers stationed in Seno had been transferred to participate in the wars of aggression against Egypt and Algeria before the Suez Canal crisis. The soldiers who remained were not in a good mood, fearing that it would be their turn next.

    On the way into the city, we saw some sawmills, tanneries, and plantations. It is said that these have only appeared in recent years after the independence of the Kingdom of Laos.

    Many signs (each sign marking a different organization) led us into the city of Savannakhet. This is a refreshing and beautiful city with a population of 15,000. It is located on the eastern bank of the Mekong River, about three or four kilometers square, and is full of evergreen trees. There are many newly built government offices and residences in the city, and it is said that there is also a technical school that has recently opened and a club that is about to open. But the most striking are the carefully constructed temples and pagodas of all sizes.

    Vice Minister Phommasane's house is a two-story building. In the living room were some gifts brought back from his visit to China. Pointing to a set of exquisite silverware and a pair of colorful glazed vases, he said happily that these gifts, symbolizing the reconnection of the traditional friendship between the two peoples, had attracted many visitors since they were brought back and displayed here.

    While resting at the Vice Minister of Propaganda's house, the Governor and Deputy Governor of Savannakhet Province, and members of the Lao Royal Parliament arrived. Member of Parliament Bounthong Voravong, who was also a member of the Lao Royal Government delegation that visited China last time, had just completed a seven-day period as a monk in the temple. Hearing that a reporter from Beijing had arrived, he came to meet me especially. The Governor and Deputy Governor invited the reporter to visit their area at will and asked some overseas Chinese friends to help arrange accommodation for me.

    After the evening banquet, an elder invited everyone present to attend the "Aubone" (temple fair). He is the president of the provincial court and also the host of the "Aubone." It is said that each temple holds an "Aubone" only once a year, and those days become important local festivals.

    From a distance, we could see the bright lights on the temple square and hear the rhythmic music coming from there. The "Aubone" is completely different from the "That Luang" temple fair. There are no rituals, and there are no distinctions of rank. It is a purely recreational and festive gathering, and all the proceeds go to the temple's expenses.

    When we arrived, various programs had already begun. Here, there was the "Lam Vong" where a man and a woman sang in response, the "Lam Luang" performed on stage in costumes, and the mass dance "Lakhon" which resembled a social dance. It is said that there is also a "Lam Thoun" which is like a poetry recitation, but unfortunately it was not performed this time.

    Local friends led me around the venue, admiring the programs that were full of national style and local characteristics one by one. Finally, we stopped in front of the stage where the "Lakhon" dance was being performed. It seemed that this attracted the most people. In the middle, a wooden platform was built, and a circle of long benches was placed around the railing for the girls participating in the dance to rest. Each "Lakhon" dance lasted about five minutes. Before the dance, the men had to buy a string of paper flowers and give it to the girl of their choice. When the music started, they went on stage to identify the person by the flowers, put their hands together in prayer, and invite the other person to dance. The steps of this "Lakhon" dance are very casual, just moving slowly to the rhythm. Although they dance in pairs, the men and women do not interact with each other. It is said that this dance is quite common in Laos, not only during festivals, but also at ordinary times. The difference is that the festival "Lakhon" has time limits and each time money is collected by selling flower garlands. This is also a way to donate money to the temple.

    The Vice Minister of Propaganda, the Governor, the President of the Court, and others all happily participated in this mass dance, and I was also invited to dance several times. According to Lao custom, it is very impolite for a guest not to dance when invited.

    The next morning, friends in Savannakhet accompanied me on a tour of the city, and then we went fifteen kilometers away to visit the famous historical site: "That Ing Hang." It is said that this pagoda has a history of more than 1,300 years. Although the pagoda is not very tall, it is very unique and ancient.

    Because Savannakhet is located in the central transportation hub of Laos, it has become a historical hub for economic and cultural exchanges between the north and south and between the inside and outside. At the same time, it is also the most politically sensitive place. The flames of the Lao people's half-century struggle against colonial aggression were first ignited here. In 1901, when the French colonialists had just extended their bloody hands into Laos, the people of Savannakhet responded to the call of an ordinary farmer named Phou Kadout and used primitive weapons such as knives, swords, wooden sticks, and bows and arrows to attack French military strongholds. As a result, Phou Kadout and hundreds of insurgents were killed. After their deaths, people from all over the country paraded with incense and flowers, praying for the arrival of "Buddha Mibun" (i.e., the Gospel People), and refused to provide corvée labor and pay taxes to the colonialists. This was again met with bloody suppression, and many of those arrested were sent to Savannakhet city to be "beheaded as a warning to the public." This is the famous "Buddha Mibun-Phou Kadout Movement," which lasted for three years and wrote a glorious page in the history of the Lao people's resistance to foreign oppression.

    The Lao people call Savannakhet Province "Savann," and "khet" may be the ending sound translated by Europeans. And "Savann" means "paradise." This province called paradise is indeed very rich. In addition to rice, agricultural products include corn, cotton, tobacco, and cardamom; forest products include various valuable timbers; animal husbandry is particularly developed, and leather is also the most famous. The yellow cattle, buffalo, pigs, and leather exported from here every year account for a large proportion of the country's exports; and mineral resources are also very rich. Although it has not been prospected, tin mines have been discovered in Bongpheng and gold mines have been discovered in Xepon in the past year or two.

    Savannakhet is one of the largest provinces in Laos, ranking first or second among the twelve provinces. Due to its relatively convenient transportation and all the favorable conditions for economic development, it, like other provinces in the country, is still in an almost undeveloped state after being subjected to long-term exploitation by colonialism. There is a particular lack of technical talent. Recently, the province opened a technical school with more than forty students. The Governor expressed confidence that he would make achievements in the future when implementing the Kingdom Government's five-year plan. (See photos)

    沙湾拿吉一日
    本报记者　展潮
    我到老挝的第五天，王国政府宣传部次长通·苏蒂冯·诺腊特邀我同他一道到他的家乡沙湾拿吉去访问。诺腊特曾随同梭发那·富马首相访问中国，留下了很深刻的印象。这次，他趁议会休会，陪同他的夫人回家一转，还顺便把北京电影厂送的一部老挝王国政府代表团访问中国的纪录片，带到那里去放映。
    飞机离开万象，便一直在泰国呵叻高原的上空飞行，一个钟头零几分钟后，平安地降落在塞诺机场上。从机场到沙湾拿吉市区还有三十五公里。因为要等汽车，我们在候机室里逗留了半个多钟点。透过候机室的窗户看出去，可以见到机场旁边有许多法国兵光着脊背在执行勤务，附近是一溜溜营房，围着铁丝网。诺腊特久久地看着那里，然后回过头来对我说了几个字：“日内瓦”。他的意思好像是说：根据日内瓦协议，法国只能在这里保留它最后一个基地，而且老挝王国政府认为必要时有权要求它撤离。后来听人说，驻在塞诺的三千多名法国兵，在苏伊士运河区发生战争以前，很大一部分被调去参加了侵略埃及和阿尔及利亚的战争。留下来的兵士们心情都不太好，害怕轮到自己头上。
    在进城的路上，看到了些锯木场、皮革场和种植园等。据说，这些都是老挝王国独立后，近年来才有的。
    许多牌子（每个牌子标志着不同的机关），把我们引进了沙湾拿吉市区。这是一座拥有一万五千人、很清爽、很美丽的城市。它紧贴着湄公河的东岸，约有三、四公里见方，到处生长着四季常青的树木。市内有不少新盖的机关和住宅，据说还有一座刚开办不久的技术学校和一幢行将揭幕的俱乐部。但最引人注意的还是那些精心构筑的庙宇和大小佛塔。
    诺腊特次长的家是一座两层楼房。客厅里摆着一些访问中国时带回来的礼物。他指点着一副精致的银具和一对彩釉大花瓶愉快地说：这些象征两国人民之间传统友谊重新连接的礼品，自从运回陈设在这里以后，常常招来了许多参观者。
    在宣传部次长家里休息的时候，沙湾拿吉省省长、副省长、老挝王国议会议员都来了。议员汶通·弗拉冯也是上次到中国进行友好访问的老挝王国政府代表团团员之一，他刚在庙里当了七天和尚出来，听说来了北京的记者，特地赶来见面。省长和副省长请记者随便参观他们的地方，并让几位华侨朋友帮忙替我安排住处。
    夜宴结束后，一位长者邀请所有在座的人都去参加“奥本”（庙会）。他是本省法院院长，同时也是“奥本”的主持人。据说每座庙一年只举行一次“奥本”，那几天便成为地方上重大的节日了。
    在老远，就看见那座庙宇广场上明亮的灯光，听见从那里传来的节奏鲜明的音乐声。“奥本”跟“塔龙”那种庙会完全不同，没有任何仪式，也不分任何等级，它是纯粹娱乐和联欢性质的集会，收入全部作为庙宇的经费。
    我们到的时候，各种节目都已经开始了。在这里，有男女两个人唱答的“蓝兑”，有在舞台上穿着戏装演唱的“蓝良”，也有仿佛是交谊舞似的群众性的舞蹈“拉宽”。据说还有一种像是诗朗诵的“蓝吞”，可惜这次没有表演。
    当地朋友们引着我在场子里走动，逐个欣赏那些富有民族风格和地方特点的节目。最后来到了跳“拉宽”舞的舞台前面停下来，大概数这里吸引的群众最多了。中间一个木板搭成的高台子上，四周靠近栏杆摆着一圈长板凳，是供参加跳舞的姑娘们休息的。“拉宽”舞每一场大概跳五分钟，跳前男的要买一串纸花随便交给那位姑娘，舞曲一起就到台上按花认人，合十邀请对方共舞。这种“拉宽”舞步很随便，只要按着节拍徐徐移动就可以了。跳时虽然是一对一对的，但是男女各不相干。据说这种舞在老挝相当普遍，不仅是逢年过节，就在平时也跳。所不同的是，节日的“拉宽”有时间限制和每次都通过卖花串来收钱。这也是寺庙捐钱的一种办法。
    宣传部次长、省长、法院院长等都兴高采烈地参加了这种群众性的舞蹈，我也被他们邀请跳了好几次。按照老挝的风俗，客人如被邀请后不跳，那是很失礼的。
    第二天早晨，沙湾拿吉的朋友们陪同我游览了市区，然后到十五公里以外去探访著名的古迹：—“塔隐恒”。据说这座佛塔已有一千三百多年历史，塔身虽不太高大，但却很独特古雅。
    沙湾拿吉因为居于老挝中部交通要冲，便成为历史上南北和内外经济、文化交流的枢纽，同时也是政治上最敏锐的地方。老挝人民近半世纪反抗殖民主义侵略斗争的烽火，首先就是在这里燃烧起来的。1901年，当法国殖民者刚把它的血手伸进老挝不久，沙湾拿吉人民纷纷响应一位名叫孚加都特的普通农民的号召，以刀、剑、木棒和弓箭等原始武器攻打法军据点，结果孚加都特和几百位起义者被害。在他们死后，各地群众举香捧花游行，祈祷“佛米奔”（即福音的人）降临，并且拒绝给殖民者出伕纳税，这一次又遭到了血腥的镇压，许多被捕者被送到沙湾拿吉市里“斩首示众”。这就是有名的“佛米奔—孚加都特运动”，前后持续了三年之久，在老挝人民反抗外国压迫的历史上写下了光辉的一页。
    老挝人把沙湾拿吉省叫作“沙湾”省，“拿吉”可能是欧洲人翻译的尾音。而“沙湾”就是“天堂”的意思。这个被称为天堂的省份确实是很富饶的。农产除稻米外，还有玉蜀黍、棉花、烟草、白豆蔻等；林产有各种贵重的木材；牧畜业尤其发达，皮革也最著名，每年从这里输出国外的黄牛、水牛、生猪和皮革等，要占全国出口品很大的比例；而矿藏也十分丰富，虽然还没有勘探过，但近一两年内却已经在邦屏地方发现了锡矿，在西本地方发现了金矿。
    沙湾是老挝全国十二个省中数一数二的大省，由于交通比较方便，具备着发展经济的一切有利条件，但是在殖民主义长期的压榨之下，它也和全国其他省份一样，至今仍处在几乎没有开拓的状态中。技术人才尤其缺乏，最近省里开办了一所有四十多个学生的技术学校。省长表示有信心在将来执行王国政府的五年计划时作出成绩来。（附图片）
