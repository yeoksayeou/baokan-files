Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 5th: Indications suggest that Israel is again attempting to delay the withdrawal of its troops from Egypt following a meeting between United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) Commander Burns and Israeli Chief of Staff Dayan on January 4th regarding the withdrawal of Israeli forces.

Burns and Dayan met at the small airport in El Arish, in the Sinai Peninsula, but they did not announce any timetable for the second phase of the Israeli withdrawal.

Burns only said that he would report to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld before the second phase begins.

Both Burns and Dayan refused to answer questions from reporters, but they indicated that Israeli forces would remain in El Arish for some time.

Currently, the Israeli front line is located west of El Arish, a city on the Mediterranean coast west of the Gaza Strip. Burns had announced on January 2nd that the UNEF would enter the city on January 6th.

An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said on January 4th that the first phase of the Israeli withdrawal from Egypt would end on January 7th, but he did not indicate when Israeli forces would continue to withdraw from Egypt.

According to Western news agencies, Israel may put forward some "conditions" before the second phase of the withdrawal.

    以色列又企图延迟从埃及撤军
    新华社5日讯　开罗消息：联合国紧急部队司令伯恩斯同以色列参谋长达扬在4日就以色列军队撤退的问题进行了会谈。迹象显示，以色列又企图延迟把军队撤出埃及。
    伯恩斯同达扬在西奈半岛阿里希小型机场会谈，但是他们没有宣布以色列第二阶段撤军的任何时间表。
    伯恩斯只说，在第二阶段开始之前，他将向联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德汇报。
    伯恩斯和达扬都拒绝回答记者的问题，但是他们表示，以色列部队将在阿里希呆上一些时候。
    目前以色列的前线位于阿里希以西，阿里希是加沙地带以西地中海沿岸的一个城市。伯恩斯曾经在2日宣布，联合国紧急部队要在1月6日开入这个城市。
    以色列外交部发言人在4日说，以色列从埃及撤军的第一阶段将在1月7日结束，但是他没有表示以色列军队将在什么时候继续从埃及撤退。
    据西方通讯社透露，以色列可能要在第二阶段撤军之前提出一些“条件”。
