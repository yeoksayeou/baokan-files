Xinhua News Agency, London, 10th. British newspapers published commentaries stating that Eden's resignation indicates the failure of his policies. Some newspapers called for immediate general elections and the formulation of new policies.

	"The Daily Worker" said in its editorial today: "As a means of deceiving the British people and saving the government, the Conservative Party has abandoned Eden."
	The newspaper called for early general elections. It said: "The various bans on British trade with China and Eastern Europe, which Butler and Macmillan still agree on, should be lifted immediately. The huge military expenditure burden, which is twice as high per capita as that of any other European country, must be drastically reduced."
	The newspaper said that in the Middle East, the British government should not follow the United States, but should seek to develop new relations with Arab countries on the basis of equal rights.
	"The Daily Worker's" editorial concluded: "Those who are unwilling to be satisfied with sacrificing Eden must demand the resignation of the entire Conservative cabinet."

	"The Daily Herald" also called for early general elections and the rapid dissolution of Parliament. The newspaper said: "What we need is leadership that the nation can unanimously support in a great recovery effort. And such leadership cannot be provided by the Conservative Party." It believed that the Labour Party could take on this responsibility.

	"The Daily Mirror" published an editorial entitled "A Dismal Failure," saying that Eden's last great mistake was the unfortunate war over the Suez Canal issue.

	"The Daily Mail" asked whether Eden's resignation was due to pressure and hostility from the US government. The newspaper said, "For nine weeks, our ambassador to Washington has received only one purely formal reception." "The inference seems to be that as long as Eden is Prime Minister, Washington regards Britain as an unrepentant naughty child."

	"The Daily Mail" said that the British people suspect that "Washington is choosing our Prime Minister for us," and "this is intolerable."

	"The Times" expressed disapproval of a general election. It said that the new government must be a Conservative government, "holding a general election at this time would be most detrimental to the country."

    艾登在内外压力下倒台
    新华社伦敦10日电　英国报纸发表评论说，艾登辞职是表明他的政策失败了。有些报纸要求立即举行大选和制订新政策。
      “工人日报”在今天的社论中说：“作为欺骗英国人民和拯救政府的手段，保守党把艾登抛弃了。”
    这家报纸要求早日举行大选。它说：“巴特勒和麦克米伦仍然同意的关于英国同中国和东欧的贸易的各种禁令应当立即取消。必须大大减少按人口比例计算比任何其他欧洲国家的军费多一倍的巨额军费负担。”
    这家报纸说，在中东，英国政府不应当跟在美国后面走，而应当设法在权利平等的基础上同阿拉伯国家发展新的关系。
    “工人日报”的社论最后说：“凡是不愿因为牺牲艾登而感到满足的人们必须要求保守党内阁全体辞职。”
      “每日先驱报”也要求早日举行大选和迅速解散议会。这家报纸说：“我们所需要的领导是全国能够一致支持进行巨大的恢复努力的领导。而这种领导不是保守党所能提供的。”它认为工党能负起这个责任。
      “每日镜报”以“凄凉的失败”为题发表社论说，艾登最后所犯的大错是就苏伊士运河问题进行了不幸的战争。
      “每日简报”问道，艾登的辞职是否由于美国政府的压力和敌意。报纸说，“九个星期以来，我们驻华盛顿大使只受到了一次纯粹是形式上的接见。”“推论好像是，只要艾登还当首相，华盛顿就认为英国是一个不肯改过自新的顽童。”
      “每日简报”说，英国人民怀疑，“华盛顿正在为我们挑选首相”，而“这是不能容忍的”。
      “泰晤士报”表示不赞成大选。它说，新政府必须是保守党政府，“在这个时候举行大选对国家是最不利的”。
