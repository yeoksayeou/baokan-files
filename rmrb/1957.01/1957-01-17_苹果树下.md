    Under the Apple Tree
    Wan Yixuan
    Autumn is the season of harvest, and the garden is full of apple trees. From afar, they look like maple forests dyed by frost; up close, they resemble clusters of wildfire.
    A girl sits under the tree, weaving a basket, softly singing a song.
    It is not to express the sorrow of parting, nor to pour out the joy of harvest;
    She is saying: "Distant relatives, please taste the apples from our hometown. Pick the biggest and reddest ones, I want to send you a few."
    "If you find the fruit sweet, please don't forget the person under the tree; if you like the crimson color, please remember the heart of the person..."

    苹果树下
    万忆萱秋天，是收获的季节，园子里结了满树苹果。远望去，像是霜染枫林，走近看，像是团团野火。姑娘编筐树下坐，口里轻轻唱着歌。不是发泄离别的哀愁，也不是倾吐丰收的欢乐；她是在说：“远方的亲人，请你尝尝家乡的苹果，拣个儿大的颜色红的，我要给你寄去几个。“假如你感到果子甜蜜，就请你别忘树下的人；假如你喜欢赤红颜色，就请你记住人儿的心……”
