Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 19th: Winter production activities in rural Sichuan Province have made significant progress compared to before. In addition to more active sideline production, the number of small reservoirs, mountain ponds, and canals under construction across the province has more than doubled compared to late December of last year. The completed and ongoing water conservancy projects can irrigate more than two million mu of farmland. In the Nanchong Special District, more than 1,000 agricultural cooperatives in eleven counties have recently united to build 360 small reservoirs. In Langzhong County, 100,000 people have been engaged in water conservancy construction daily since the beginning of this year, several times more than in December last year. A mass upsurge in fertilizer accumulation has appeared in many parts of the province. According to rough statistics from the Leshan, Yibin, Neijiang, Jiangjin, and Nanchong Special Districts, more than 1 billion jin of natural fertilizers, including green manure, compost, stable manure, and night soil, have been accumulated in the past half-month or so, exceeding the total amount accumulated in the entire month of December last year. In the hilly areas of Suining, Neijiang, Mianyang, and other Special Districts, land processing work has been launched one after another. In addition, the entire province has universally carried out one round of mid-cultivation and topdressing for small spring crops such as wheat and rapeseed, and in many places, the second weeding has already been done.

Last winter, Sichuan carried out ideological education among farmers, affirming the achievements of cooperation and production, realistically analyzing shortcomings and errors in work and production, and identifying ways to increase production this year. Various counties also convened representative meetings of advanced agricultural producers (workers), commending and rewarding cadres who led production well and agricultural cooperatives and individuals with production achievements. At the same time, 65% of the agricultural cooperatives in the province have completed last year's income distribution work (the remaining cooperatives are still in progress). As a result of the distribution, most cooperatives have achieved increased income for 90% of their members. These have greatly encouraged the productive enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers, enabling them to actively engage in winter production activities.

    总结了办社成绩　找出了增产门路
    做好了收益分配　表扬了先进人物
    四川冬季生产比上月大为活跃
    新华社成都19日电　四川省农村中的冬季生产活动比前有了显著进展。除副业生产比前活跃以外，全省开工的小型水库、山弯塘和渠堰，也比去年12月下旬时增加了一倍多，已经完工和正在施工的水利工程，共可灌田两百万亩以上。南充专区十一个县最近有一千多个农业社联合起来兴修三百六十座小型水库；阆中县从今年年初起，每天有十万人兴修水利，人数比去年12月时增加好几倍。全省有许多地方出现了群众性的积肥热潮。据乐山、宜宾、内江、江津、南充等专区的粗略统计，在最近半个多月内，共积绿肥、堆肥、厩肥、粪尿等自然肥料十亿多斤，比去年12月全月积的肥还多。在丘陵区的遂宁、内江、绵阳等专区，已经先后展开土地加工工作。另外在小麦、油菜等小春作物的田间管理方面，全省已经普遍进行了一次中耕追肥，有不少地方并且已经薅了第二次草。
    四川各地去年冬天曾普遍向农民进行思想教育工作，肯定合作化和生产的成绩，实事求是地分析工作和生产上的缺点和错误，找出了今年增产的门路。各县又召开农业先进生产（工作）者代表会议，表扬和奖励了领导生产好的干部和生产有成就的农业社和个人。同时，全省有65％的农业社已经结束去年收益分配的工作（其余社还在进行），分配结果，绝大部分社都做到了90％的社员增加收入。这些都大大鼓舞了广大农民的生产情绪，使他们积极地投入冬季生产活动。
