    There is no Winter Here
    In the morning, the sunlight was pale, and the cold wind stirred up gusts of yellow sand, making people shiver. At this time, I visited the workers who were making concrete door frames at the construction group of the Baotou Steel and Iron Company construction site's mechanical station.

    A young man, wearing a leather vest, was sitting in front of a stove frying sand, his face flushed red. I approached him and said, "Xiao Zhao! It's nice and warm here for you!"
    He asked me to sit down and said humorously and wittily, "I'm warm in the chest from the fire, but the wind is cold on my back!"

    Old Liu was tamping the concrete in the door frame. Probably because the iron tamper was too cold to hold, he would work for a while, then breathe on his hands to warm them up. When I approached him, he was already tamping another door frame. He said to another member of the group, "Hurry up, you're falling behind."
    I asked strangely, "What are you doing...?"
    "Competing," Old Liu replied quickly. He then took off his gloves, took a box of some kind of oil out of his pocket, and rubbed it on his hands. I saw that his hands had some cracks from the cement and the blowing north wind. I asked him, "Doesn't it hurt?" He smiled, shook his head, and started working again.

    The sunlight was a little stronger than before, but the cold wind was still blowing. I asked Master Liu, "Is it possible to complete the mission in such cold weather?"
    "Why? We exceed the quota every day!" As he spoke, he started working intensely again.

    I looked around at each working comrade, and they were all so calm and quick, not feeling cold at all, as if there were no winter here. (Xiao Mei)

    这里没有冬天
    早晨，阳光淡白淡白的，寒风卷起阵阵的黄沙，吹得人瑟瑟发抖。这时，我在包钢工地机械站的建筑群里，访问了正在打混凝土门框的工人们。
    一个青年小伙子，穿着皮坎肩，坐在火炉前炒砂子，脸烤得通红。我靠近他说：“小赵！你这里不错，那么暖和！”
    他让我坐下，幽默而有风趣地说：“我这是火烤胸前暖、风吹背后寒啊！”
    老刘在门框上捣固混凝土。大概是因为铁钎子太冻手，干一会儿，哈哈气暖和暖和。当我走近他的时候，他已在捣固另一个门框了。他对另外一个组员说：“快点呀，你给拉下了。”
    我奇怪地问：“你们这是……？”
    “竞赛。”老刘很快答道。一边，又脱下手套，从兜里掏出一盒什么油，往手上擦。我看到他的手，因为洋灰咬，北风吹，裂了一些口子。我问他：“不痛吗？”他笑了笑，晃晃脑袋，又开始工作了。
    阳光比以前强了些，可是寒风还是吹，我问刘师傅：“天这么冷，你们能完成任务吗？”
    “怎么？每天都超额！”说着，他又紧张地干起来了。
    我环视每个工作的同志，他们都是那样沉着而迅速，一点都不觉得冷，好像这里没有冬天一样。　（小梅）
