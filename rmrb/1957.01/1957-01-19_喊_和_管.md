"People shout when medicines are out of stock, but no one manages medicine production." This is the title of an article in the Jilin Daily on January 10th. In Jilin Province, the hometown of ginseng, the shortage of ginseng and many other medicinal materials is becoming increasingly worrying, so this article issued a serious warning.

Jilin Province is one of the major producing areas of medicinal materials in the country, producing more than eighty kinds of medicinal materials. However, the decline of medicinal material production in Jilin Province today has reached an alarming level. First, let's look at the miserable situation of artificial cultivation of medicinal materials: The main producing areas of cultivated ginseng, Fusong and Ji'an counties, had a cultivated ginseng output of 680,000 jin in 1930, but the province's output in 1955 was only about 150,000 jin. In 1924, the Shiyitang Pharmacy in Jilin City alone handled over 10,000 taels of deer antler, but now, the total purchase volume of the pharmaceutical company in the entire province is only this much. The situation of wild medicinal materials is also not good. About 30%-40% of the wild ginseng purchased by the pharmaceutical company in 1955 were young ginseng that were not old enough to be harvested. In 1954, the pharmaceutical company purchased 531 jin of wild ginseng, but in 1957 it is estimated that only about 300 jin can be purchased. In 1940, the annual output of musk in Wangqing County alone was 70 jin, but at present, the total output of the province is only 30 jin. Due to the shortage of medicinal materials, many diseases can only be diagnosed by traditional Chinese medicine, but cannot be treated. Due to the shortage of medicinal materials such as musk, ginseng, and antler, more than fifty kinds of famous proprietary medicines in Jilin Province have had to reduce or stop production.

The main reason for the decline of medicinal material production in Jilin Province is the lack of leadership and management. From the province to the county, no department can be found to be responsible for leading medicinal material production. Some agricultural cooperatives not only fail to take advantage of the favorable conditions of collective management to actively restore and develop medicinal material production based on the conditions of medicinal material resources, but also restrict medicinal material production in terms of labor remuneration, etc.

Editor's note: The calls for medicinal material shortages have been going on for some time, and this call is not limited to Jilin Province. The shortage of medicinal materials is a matter of life and death, and the broad masses of people should of course shout out. The situation of "people shouting, no one managing" should end as soon as possible. It is now time to put medicinal material production on the agenda of the leadership organs of each province and include it in the plan for comprehensive development of production.

### “喊”和“管”

    “喊”和“管”
    “药材脱销有人喊，药材生产没人管”，这是1月10日的吉林日报上一篇文章的标题。在人参的家乡——吉林省，人参和其他许多药材脱销的情况越来越令人担忧了，因此这篇文章才发出了严重的警号。
    吉林省是全国药材的主要产区之一，全省出产八十多种药材。但是，如今吉林省药材生产的衰萎已经达到惊人的程度。首先看看人工培育药材的可怜景况：园参的主要产地抚松、辑安两县1930年园参产量曾达到六十八万斤，但是1955年全省产量才只有十五万斤左右。吉林市世一堂药店在1924年一家经营的鹿茸，就有一万两上下，而现在，药材公司在全省的收购量也不过这么多。野生药材的情况也不佳。药材公司1955年收购的山参中，约有30％—40％是不够挖采年龄的幼参。1954年药材公司收购了五百三十一斤山参，而1957年估计只能收购到三百斤左右。在1940年汪清县一个县的麝香年产量是七十斤，而目前全省的产量也不过三十斤。由于药材大缺，有很多病，中医只能诊断，不能治疗。由于麝香、参、茸等药材品种不足，吉林省有五十多种著名的成药不得不减产或停产。
    没有领导和管理，是吉林省药材生产衰萎的主要原因。从省到县找不到一个负责领导药材生产的部门。有些农业合作社不但不利用集体经营的有利条件，根据药材资源的条件，积极恢复和发展药材生产，反而在劳动报酬等方面限制药材生产。
    编者按：药材脱销的呼声，已经喊了好些时候了，而且不止吉林一省有这种呼声。药材脱销，事关人命，广大群众当然要喊。“有人喊，没人管”的状况应该早日结束。把药材生产提到各省领导机关的议事日程上来，列入全面发展生产的计划中去，现在已经是时候了。
