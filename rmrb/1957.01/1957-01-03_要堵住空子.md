    It is Necessary to Plug the Loopholes
    Yu Bing
    Not long ago, in Wuhan, a speculative merchant bought 20 tons of scrap iron from Yuhua Textile Mill at a high price of 80 yuan per ton. In a few days, he sold it at 560 yuan per ton, making a profit of 9,600 yuan in one transaction. In addition, five speculative merchants pooled 3,000 yuan in funds in June last year to engage in speculation in scrap metal, and by August their capital and profits had "developed" to more than 20,000 yuan. Recently, similar "characters" have appeared in Shanghai, Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places, and the prices for cornering each ton of scrap metal have exceeded the state-stipulated price by more than ten times.
    Why has speculation and illegal profiteering "revived" today? Firstly, a few capitalists have not yet been reformed and are still doing things that are detrimental to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Secondly, some enterprises only care about themselves and do not prioritize the interests of the country, creating loopholes that others can exploit.
    In the past six months, due to the shortage of steel, some improper practices have been prevalent in many units: some regard scrap metal as the private property of their own units, and even if they do not need it, they do not hand it over, believing that they have the right to dispose of it, and even sell it at high prices in violation of the material allocation discipline. Their policy is to sell to anyone who pays, regardless of the unit, the person, or the purpose for which it is bought. Other units believe that having scrap metal means "everything will be smooth sailing," so they grab it everywhere, regardless of whether it is urgent or not. At one time, there were dozens of units going to Shanghai to buy scrap metal, competing and scrambling to buy it, not afraid to pay more, and willing to sell to anyone. Even more units have turned scrap metal into "exchange coupons" among themselves, euphemistically calling them "food stamps," and those with these "food stamps" can buy machines, steel, and paper. And so on.
    Since some people are selling casually, and some people are willing to pay high prices, and no one is stopping these behaviors, it is no wonder that some profit-seeking merchants have red eyes and are engaging in speculative activities again.
    Speculative activities must be stopped, and loopholes must be plugged.

    要堵住空子
    于冰
    不久以前，武汉市有个投机商人，用八十元一吨的高价，买了裕华纱厂二十吨废铁。过不几天按五百六十元一吨卖出，一转手获利九千六百元。另有五个投机商人，在去年6月份凑了三千元资金捣动废旧金属，到8月份连本带利“发展”到两万多元。最近，上海、无锡、苏州等地，也出现了这样的“人物”，套购每吨废旧金属的价格竟超出国家规定的价格十几倍。
    投机倒把、非法谋取利润的行为今天为什么又“死灰复燃”呢？这首先是少数资本家还没有改造好，还在作一些不利于国计民生的事情。其次，一些企业单位只顾自己，不以国家利益为重，自己造成空子被人钻了进来。
    近半年来，由于钢材不足，在不少单位里流行着一些不正当的做法：有的把废旧金属当成本单位的私有财产，虽然用不着也不上缴，认为自己有权处理，甚至违反物资分配纪律高价出售。他们的方针是不管卖给什么单位、什么人、买去干什么用，反正是谁给钱都行。还有的单位以为有了废旧金属便“万事亨通”，不管急要不急要，到处乱抓。有个时期，到上海收买废旧金属的单位有几十个，争购抢购，不怕出钱多，谁卖给都行。更有些单位，相互之间把废旧金属当成了“兑换券”，美其名曰“粮票”，带有这种“粮票”的人，可以买机器、买钢材、买纸。如此等等。
    既然有人随便出卖，既然又有人肯出大价钱，而这种种行为又无人去制止，难怪某些唯利是图的商人红了眼，又进行投机活动了
    投机倒把的活动必须制止，空子必须堵住。
