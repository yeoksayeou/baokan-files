Xinhua News Agency, January 29th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Yuanjing learned from the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission: This year, China will hold thirty-five national sports competitions and competitions or performances of some new sports – skiing, handball, and sailing.

    The first national sports competition this year will be the National Ice Sports Meet, which will begin on February 2nd in Qiqihar. The National Skiing Competition will be held on February 15th in Tonghua, Jilin Province. This type of national sports competition is being held for the first time in our country.

    Some of the larger-scale national sports competitions to be held this year are: the National Cycling Championships in Beijing in April, the National Swimming and Diving Championships in Dalian and Lushun in August, the National Gymnastics Championships in Shanghai in September, the National Track and Field Games in Nanjing in October, the National Weightlifting Championships in Guangzhou in October, and the National Table Tennis Championships in Beijing in November.

    National competitions for ball games such as basketball, volleyball, and football will be held this year according to the different levels of the teams. The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission has already assessed one hundred and seventy Class A and Class B football, men's and women's basketball, volleyball teams, and Class C men's and women's basketball teams based on the level shown by the various outstanding teams across the country last year. To save time for the athletes participating in the competition, many ball game competitions will not adopt the method of concentrating all the teams participating in the same level of competition in one place, but will adopt the method of group, regional, or phased competitions. Some competitions will be held entirely on Sundays. For example, the National Football League Class A League will start in March and end in November. To make sports more popular, many cities that have not held or rarely held national sports competitions—Baoding, Guiyang, Lanzhou, Kunming, Fushun, and Jinan—have also been selected as competition venues this year.

    This year, many sports competitions between provinces and between provinces, cities, and cities are also planned, and athletes participating in the competition are also required to have qualified scores for participating in the competition. This method can improve the quality of competition and also facilitate the organization of competition activities. These competition events will include track and field, gymnastics, swimming, handball, sailing, water polo, boxing, table tennis, tennis, badminton, football, baseball, rowing, fencing, archery, and acrobatics. Among them, the Eight-City Handball Performance Match to be held in Beijing in July and the Three-City Sailing Performance to be held in Harbin are also new competition events.

    In April this year, the National 15km Cross-Country Race will be held in the capital cities of various provinces; in May, various places will hold a National Track and Field Correspondence Competition Month; in June, dragon boat performances or competitions will be held in southern cities with the conditions; in July, the first national swimming across the Yangtze River competition will be held in Wuhan.

    This year, football, softball, basketball, swimming, diving, volleyball, gymnastics, and track and field competitions specifically for young people will also be held.

    Of the thirty-five national sports competitions to be held this year, except for the National Workers' Wrestling Championships to be held in Hohhot in June, which is organized by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the other national sports competitions are organized by the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission.

    田径、球类等全国性比赛
    今年将举行三十五次
    新华社29日讯　新华社记者王元敬从体育运动委员会获悉：今年我国将举行三十五次全国性的体育比赛和一些新运动项目——滑雪、手球和帆船等的比赛或表演。
    今年的第一项全国性的体育比赛，是将在2月2日开始在齐齐哈尔举行的全国冰上运动会。2月15日将在吉林省通化举行全国滑雪运动会，这种全国性的体育比赛项目在我国还是第一次举行。
    今年举行的一些规模比较大的全国性体育比赛是：4月间将在北京举行的全国自行车锦标赛，8月间将在旅大举行的全国游泳、跳水锦标赛，9月间将在上海举行的全国体操锦标赛，10月间将在南京举行的全国田径运动会和在广州举行的全国举重锦标赛，以及11月间将在北京举行的全国乒乓球锦标赛。
    篮球、排球和足球等球类的全国性比赛，今年将按照球队的不同等级分别进行比赛。体育运动委员会已经根据全国各个优秀的球队在去年表现出的水平，评定出一百七十个甲级和乙级的足球队、男女篮、排球队和丙级男女篮球队。为了使参加比赛的运动员节省时间，许多球类比赛将不采取一次把参加同一级比赛的球队全部集中到一个地方进行比赛的办法，而采取分组、分区或分阶段的比赛办法。有些比赛将完全利用星期日举行。比如全国足球甲级队联赛将从3月间开始，进行到11月间才结束。为了使体育运动更加普及，许多没有举行过或很少举行全国性体育比赛的城市——保定、贵阳、兰州、昆明、抚顺和济南等，今年也被选为竞赛地点。
    今年还准备举行许多省和省、市和市之间的体育比赛，对于参加比赛的运动员也要求具备参加比赛的合格成绩标准。这种办法，可以提高竞赛质量，也便于组织竞赛活动。这些比赛的项目将包括田径、体操、游泳、手球、帆船、水球、拳击、乒乓球、网球、羽毛球、足球、棒球、划船、击剑、射箭和技巧运动等等。其中，7月间将在北京举行的八城市手球表演赛和在哈尔滨举行的三城市帆船表演，也都是新的比赛项目。
    今年4月间，在各省会城市将举行全国十五公里越野跑比赛；5月间，各地要举行全国田径通讯比赛月；6月间，在南方有条件的城市将举行龙舟表演或比赛；7月间，在武汉将第一次举行全国性的游泳横渡长江比赛。
    今年，还将专门举行由青、少年参加的足球、垒球、篮球、游泳、跳水、排球、体操和田径比赛。
    在今年将要举行的三十五次全国性的体育比赛中，除了6月间将在呼和浩特举行的全国工人摔跤锦标赛是由中华全国总工会举办的以外，其他的全国性体育比赛都由体育运动委员会举办。
