"Free Markets Should Cooperate Closely"
    The Sichuan Daily published an editorial, based on the market situation in Chengdu and nearby areas, proposing opinions on how various regions should determine reasonable price differences.

    The "Sichuan Daily" published an editorial on December 28, 1956, titled "Free Markets Should Cooperate Closely." The editorial stated: The prices of chickens, ducks, and eggs in the Chengdu market once soared not long ago. After a series of efforts, retail prices once dropped, and wholesale prices began to stabilize. However, recently, prices have shown a tendency to rise again.

    For many years, Chengdu's egg supply has mainly relied on nearby Wenjiang, Mianyang, and other special districts. Currently, Chengdu's egg market only has good price coordination with markets in about ten nearby counties. The egg prices in the other twenty counties have already equaled or even exceeded those in Chengdu, which seriously affects the continued stabilization of egg prices in Chengdu. The specific reasons for this abnormal phenomenon are: First, the relevant departments in Chengdu have not effectively organized and educated small vendors, and have not stopped the practice of restaurants, food factories, and collective mess halls from rushing to purchase eggs off-market. Second, after some producing areas opened free markets, management work did not keep up, and the trend of excessive price increases has not stopped to this day; some producing areas have started to do some necessary management work, but lack cooperation with neighboring regional markets, making it difficult to stabilize prices. Third, the markets between cities have not coordinated well. Chongqing's egg prices have historically been lower than Chengdu's, but are now higher, so even eggs from Pixian County, west of Chengdu, are starting to be attracted to Chongqing.

    The editorial said: Since the free markets in various regions have close links in commodity exchange, it is impossible to lead the entire market well by only managing the market in one region without comprehensive cooperation. Therefore, free markets in various regions should cooperate well on prices. That is to say, for those commodities that are of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and for which supply is short or tight, a reasonable price difference should be researched and internally controlled between cities, between producing areas, and especially between urban and rural areas, based on historical reasonable price ratios and taking into account the interests of producers, distributors, and consumers; as production and sales seasons change, the internally controlled price difference should also change accordingly. As for the prices in the free market, producers, distributors, and consumers are allowed to freely negotiate prices within a certain range above and below the internally controlled price, based on the quality of the goods and the current supply situation. If market prices exceed the level that stimulates production development, or fall to the level that harms the interests of producers, market managers can come forward to explain the situation, organize reasonable price negotiations between buyers and sellers, and jointly abide by them; state-owned stores, supply and marketing cooperatives, joint state-private stores, and cooperative stores can also appropriately engage in buying and selling to stabilize prices at a reasonable level and maintain reasonable price differences between regions. For small vendors in various regions, their transportation areas can also be appropriately divided according to the laws of commodity circulation and the habitual transportation routes of small vendors, so as to avoid material turbulence between regions. Chengdu and Shifang County have largely adopted the above methods in the transportation of eggs. As a result, egg prices in Shifang County have been relatively stable, and the Chengdu market has been steadily supplied with eggs from Shifang County at reasonable prices. Facts have proven that leading the free market in this way will not stifle the market.

    “自由市场之间应该密切配合”
    四川日报发表社论，根据成都市及附近地区市场情况，提出了各地之间如何确定合理差价的意见。
    “四川日报”在1956年12月28日发表题为“自由市场之间应该密切配合”的社论。社论说：成都市场上的鸡、鸭、蛋的价格不久前曾经一度猛涨，经过一系列的工作之后，零售价格一度回降，批发价格也开始稳定。但是，最近价格又有回涨的趋势。
    成都市销售的鸡蛋，多少年来主要依靠附近的温江、绵阳等专区供应。现在成都市鸡蛋市场只同附近大约十个县的市场在价格上配合较好，另外二十个县的鸡蛋价格已经和成都扯平，甚至高过成都，这就严重地影响着成都市蛋价的继续稳定。发生这种畸形现象的具体原因是：第一、成都市的有关部门对于小商贩没有很好地进行组织、教育，对于饮食业、食品厂以及集体伙食单位在场外抢购鸡蛋的做法，没有加以制止。第二、有些产地开放自由市场后，管理工作没有跟上去，价格过分上涨的趋势至今还没有停止；有的产地虽然开始做了一些必要的管理工作，但是，缺乏毗邻地区市场的配合，价格也难得到稳定。第三、城市和城市之间的市场也没有配合好。重庆的蛋价历来低于成都，现在却高过成都，因此，连成都西边的郫县的鸡蛋也开始被吸引到重庆去了。
    社论说：既然各地的自由市场在物资交流中有着紧密的联系，光靠管好某一个地区的市场而不全面通力合作，整个市场当然不可能领导好。因此，各地自由市场应当在价格上互相配合好。这就是说，要对那些关系国计民生较大的供不应求或者供求紧张的商品，根据历史上的合理比价，兼顾生产者、运销者和消费者的利益，在城市之间、产地之间，尤其是在城乡之间，研究出一个内部掌握的合理差价；随着产销季节的变化，内部掌握的差价也相应地改变。至于自由市场上的价格，允许生产者、运销者和消费者根据商品质量的好坏和当时的供应情况，在内部掌握的价格的上下一定幅度以内，自由议价。如果市场上的价格超过了刺激生产发展的程度，或者下跌到损害生产者的利益的程度，可以由市场管理人员出面说明情况，组织购销双方合理议价，共同遵守；国营商店、供销合作社、公私合营商店、合作商店，也可以适当进行吞吐，以便使价格稳定在合理的水平上，使地区之间保持合理的差价。对于各个地区的小商贩，也可以根据物资流转的规律和小商贩习惯的贩运路线，适当地划分他们的贩运区域，以免造成地区之间的物资乱流。成都市和什邡县之间，在鸡蛋的贩运上就大体上采取了以上的办法。结果，什邡县的蛋价一直比较稳定，成都市场也以合理的价格从什邡县源源得到鸡蛋的供应。事实证明：这样领导自由市场，是不会把市场管死的。
