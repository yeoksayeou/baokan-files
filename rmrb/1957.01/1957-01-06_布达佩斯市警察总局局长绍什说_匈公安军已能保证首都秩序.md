Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 5th: According to the "People's Liberty Daily," Budapest Police Chief Colonel György Szós told a press conference in response to questions from foreign journalists that the police force is gradually being strengthened and can now guarantee order in the capital. The number of Soviet troops in Budapest is already very small. In some important places, such as bridgeheads, order is maintained by the Hungarian Public Security Forces.

Szós said that the number of serious criminal cases now is no more than, or even less than, the number that occurs under normal circumstances, one of the reasons being the round-the-clock duty of the Public Security Forces.

There are very few people currently detained in police stations. Anyone who is proven not to have committed a crime is released within 24 to 48 hours of arrest at the most. We have not illegally detained anyone.

Regarding the arrest of some writers, he said that the task of the police is to guarantee order and public safety, whether for writers or people in other professions. When strikes were obviously undermining the happiness of the people, and some Hungarian writers were still carrying out activities beneficial to the counter-revolution, and some were stubbornly engaging in incitement, thus threatening public order and national security. Our arrest of writers was also carried out according to the law. When we saw that the activities of certain writers were illegal, but from the point of view of national security, it was not necessary to detain them, we released them. Those who seriously violated the law are, of course, still in detention.

    布达佩斯市警察总局局长绍什说
    匈公安军已能保证首都秩序
    新华社布达佩斯5日电　据“人民自由报”报道：布达佩斯市警察总局局长捷尔吉·绍什上校在记者招待会上答复外国记者的问题时说，目前警察局逐渐在加强，已能保证首都的秩序。在布达佩斯的苏军数目已经很少了。在一些重要地方，如桥头等，已由匈牙利公安军维持秩序。
    绍什说，现在严重犯罪案件的次数已经不超过一般情况下所发生的次数，甚至还要少些，原因之一是公安军的日夜值勤起了作用。
    目前拘留在警察局的人是很少的，凡是证明未犯罪者都在逮捕后二十四小时至多四十八小时内释放，我们并未非法地拘留任何人。
    关于有的作家被逮捕的问题，他说，警察局的任务是保证秩序和公共安全，不论对作家和其他职业的人都一样。当罢工显然已在破坏人民幸福的时候，而匈牙利的一些作家仍在进行有利于反革命的活动，一些人还顽固地进行挑拨，因而就威胁了公共秩序和国家的安全。我们逮捕作家也是根据法律进行的，当看到某些作家的活动虽然违法，但是从国家安全的观点上看认为不必要加以拘留的时候，我们也就把他们释放了。那些严重违法的人当然还在拘留中。
