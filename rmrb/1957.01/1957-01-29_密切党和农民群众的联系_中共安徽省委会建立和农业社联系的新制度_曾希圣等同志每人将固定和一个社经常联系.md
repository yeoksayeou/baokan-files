    Strengthening Ties Between the Party and the Peasant Masses
    The CCP Anhui Provincial Committee Establishes a New System for Contacting Agricultural Cooperatives
    Comrade Zeng Xisheng and Others Will Each Regularly Contact a Fixed Cooperative
    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Anhui Daily: In order to strengthen the ties between the Party and the peasant masses and to promote the development of socialist construction in the rural areas of Anhui in a better and faster manner, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has discussed and decided to establish a new system. This system stipulates that, from now on, thirty-five provincial party secretaries, members, and alternate members of the Provincial Committee stationed in Hefei, led by Comrade Zeng Xisheng (excluding those who are ill or on leave for study), and one hundred and forty-six heads of various departments of the Provincial Committee, various departments and bureaus of the provincial capital, people's organizations, institutions, enterprises, and universities, will each establish long-term contact with a fixed agricultural production cooperative, and regularly go deep into the cooperatives to provide specific assistance and guidance in their work.
    Most of the Provincial Committee members have already identified a cooperative themselves. The issue of which agricultural cooperative the remaining comrades will establish contact with was researched and determined by the Rural Work Department of the Provincial Committee on the 18th of this month. These one hundred and eighty-one people will conduct regular contact with one hundred and eighty-one agricultural production cooperatives, respectively, in five counties including Feixi, Dingyuan, Chaoxian, Shouxian, Feidong, and Jianghuai, Xingguang, and Fengshou and other cooperatives in the suburbs of Hefei.
    Recently, among these one hundred and eighty-one people, in addition to some who have already gone to various regions to inspect and assist in their work, more than one hundred others will go to the agricultural cooperatives they will be contacting as Party reporters to conduct propaganda on current affairs and other issues, as their first contact with the agricultural cooperative members.

    密切党和农民群众的联系
    中共安徽省委会建立和农业社联系的新制度
    曾希圣等同志每人将固定和一个社经常联系
    本报讯　据安徽日报报道：为了密切党和农民群众的联系，更好更快地推动安徽农村社会主义建设事业的发展，中共安徽省委讨论决定建立了一项新制度。这项制度规定：从现在起，以曾希圣同志为首的驻合肥的省委书记、委员和候补委员三十五人（因病和离职学习的不在内），以及省委各部、省会各厅、局，人民团体、事业、企业机关、大专学校的负责人等一百四十六人，每人固定和一个农业生产合作社建立长期联系，经常深入具体地帮助指导农业社的工作。
    省委委员们，大都已自己认定了一个社，其余同志与哪个农业社建立联系问题，省委农村工作部于本月18日已研究确定。这一百八十一人将分别和肥西、定远、巢县、寿县、肥东等五个县及合肥市郊区的江淮、星光、丰收等一百八十一个农业生产社进行经常的联系。
    最近，这一百八十一人中，除了部分已经分赴各地区检查帮助工作外，还将有一百多人，以党的报告员身份，到他将要联系的农业社去进行时事等问题的宣传，作为和农业社员的首次接触。
