Xinhua News Agency, Anshan Electric Telegram Anshan Iron and Steel Company, many factories and mines of staff, in the first half of January broke the new quotas for this year. In the first half of January, eleven major products, including lean ore, artificial rich ore, steel ingots, steel billets, medium-sized steel, and metallurgical coke, all overfulfilled their production plans. Among them, steel production increased by more than 47,300 tons compared with the same period last year, steel billets increased by 56,500 tons, steel increased by nearly 20,000 tons, and the output of lean ore from the Dagushan Iron Mine increased by more than 110,000 tons.

	The workers of the primary rolling mill made preparations for this year's production before the new year, and overhauled the main production equipment in a planned way, so they created a new record for the highest daily output on New Year's Day, and increased the production of more than 800 tons of steel billets on this day. This factory has overfulfilled its production plan every day for half a month.

	The First Steelmaking Plant used the rapid steelmaking method to produce 199 heats of steel in half a month, shortening the steelmaking time per heat by 46 minutes compared with the plan.

	Braving the severe cold, the miners working in the open pit of the Dagushan Iron Mine increased the production of ore by more than 5,300 tons in half a month in order to ensure the supply of raw materials for ironmaking and sintering, and the total output increased by more than 110,000 tons compared with the same period last year.

	The workers of the medium-sized rolling mill closely combined production with discussions of this year's plan, and their enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high, and new production achievements continued to emerge. In half a month, they produced more than 1,460 tons of steel more than planned.

	Due to the fact that workers have broken new quotas one after another, the technical and economic indicators of many factories and mines have been significantly improved. The hourly steel rolling capacity of the medium-sized rolling mill in the first half of the month increased by 63.5% compared with the same period last year, and the large-sized rolling mill increased by 40%.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan Electric Telegram The workers of the two steelmaking plants of Anshan Iron and Steel Company produced more than 9,000 tons of steel more than planned in the first half of January.

	The workers of the First Steelmaking Plant, which increased the production of more than 37,000 tons of steel for the country last year, are even more enthusiastic about production in the new year, and they are full of confidence in striving to create the highest monthly output record since the opening of the plant again in January. From New Year's Day, the steelmaking workers started a rapid steelmaking competition on the basis of maintaining the furnace body. Li Shangzhong, a steelmaking expert who had just returned from a study tour in the Soviet Union, used the rapid steelmaking method to produce a heat of steel on New Year's Day, shortening the steelmaking time by more than two hours compared with the plan.

	In the past half month, the average time for steelmaking workers in the First Steelmaking Plant to produce one heat of steel has been shortened by another quarter of an hour compared with the fastest month of steelmaking last year.

	In the Second Steelmaking Plant, which was basically completed last year, the workers also overcame various difficulties and overfulfilled the production plan for the first half of January.

    鞍钢职工纷纷突破今年新定额
    炼钢厂上半月增产九千多吨钢
    新华社鞍山电　鞍山钢铁公司许多厂矿职工，在1月上半月里突破了今年的新定额。在1月上半月里，贫矿、人造富矿、钢锭、钢坯、中型钢材、冶金焦等十一种主要产品，都超额完成了生产计划。其中钢产量比去年同期增加四万七千三百多吨，钢坯增加五万六千五百吨，钢材增加近二万吨，大孤山铁矿的贫矿产量增加十一万多吨。
    初轧厂职工在年前就做好了今年的生产准备工作，有计划地把主要生产设备加以检修，因此在元旦创造了日产量最高新纪录，这一天就增产八百多吨钢坯。这个厂半个月来都逐日地超额完成生产计划。
    第一炼钢厂在半个月里用快速炼钢方法炼出了一百九十九炉钢，每炉钢的炼钢时间比计划缩短了四十六分钟。
    冒着严寒在大孤山铁矿露天作业的矿工们，为了保证炼铁、烧结原料的供应，半个月里共增产矿石五千三百多吨，总产量比去年同期增加达十一万多吨。
    中型轧钢厂职工密切结合生产讨论今年的计划，热情空前高涨，新的生产成就不断出现，半个月就比计划多生产钢材一千四百六十多吨。
    由于职工们纷纷突破新定额，许多厂矿的技术经济指标有了显著提高。中型轧钢厂上半个月每小时的轧钢能力比去年同期提高63.5％，大型轧钢厂提高40％。
    新华社鞍山电　鞍山钢铁公司两个炼钢厂的职工，在1月上半月比计划多生产了九千多吨钢。
    去年为国家增产三万七千多吨钢的第一炼钢厂的职工们，新年生产情绪更加高涨，他们满怀信心地争取在1月份内再次创造开厂以来月产量的最高纪录。从元旦那天开始，炼钢工人就在维护好炉体的基础上展开了快速炼钢竞赛。刚从苏联参观学习归来的炼钢能手李尚忠，在元旦那天就用快速炼钢的方法炼出了一炉钢，比计划炼钢时间缩短了两个多钟头。
    在这半个月中，第一炼钢厂的炼钢工人平均每炼一炉钢的时间，比去年炼钢时间最快的一个月又缩短了一刻钟。
    在去年刚刚大体上建设完成的第二炼钢厂，工人们也克服了种种困难，超额完成了1月上半月的生产计划。
