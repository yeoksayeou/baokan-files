    Reactions to Criticism
    A letter from the Fuxian Fruit Purchasing Station of the Liaoning Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative: The article "In the Land of Apples" published on page three of the People's Daily on November 5, 1956, criticized some shortcomings in the apple purchasing work of the Delisi Temple Purchasing Sub-station. In response to the issues raised in the article, we have organized a working group and are currently inspecting the work of this sub-station.
    After the People's Daily reader's letter on November 5, 1956 exposed the behavior of a salesperson from the Siping City Daodong Department Store assaulting a customer, the Siping City Supervision Bureau immediately investigated the matter and determined that the reader's allegations were true.
    In its investigation report, the Siping City Supervision Bureau stated that the occurrence of the aforementioned facts was sufficient to demonstrate the lack of regular education on the moral character of socialist commercial workers, especially education on the concept of the legal system, on the part of the store's leadership. However, the fact that state-owned store employees disregarded national laws and violated human rights caused outrage among many people present and had a very negative political impact on the Party and the government, seriously damaging the prestige of state-owned commerce.
    However, considering that the customer was a mental patient and was in the midst of an episode at the time, with the possibility of endangering public property, the salesperson took the rude action of hitting the person in order to protect state property from damage, therefore, legal sanctions may be avoided. However, in order to redress the impact and educate the individual and all the sales staff, the Siping City Commercial Bureau decided to give Liu Linrui, who kicked and hit the customer, an administrative demerit. Li Hongzeng, who asked for rope to tie up and whip the patient, was given an administrative warning.
    In order to educate all commercial personnel on this incident, the Siping City People's Committee of Jilin Province also issued a circular.

专栏：对批评的反应

    对批评的反应
    辽宁省供销合作社复县水果采购站来信：1956年11月5日人民日报三版发表“在苹果之乡”一文，对得利寺采购分站收购苹果工作中的一些缺点提出批评。针对文章中所提出的问题，我们组织了一个工作组，正在对这个分站的工作进行检查。
    本报1956年11月5日读者来信揭发了四平市道东百货公司营业员殴打顾客的行为以后，四平市监察局即对这件事做了调查，认为读者揭露的事情是真实的。
    四平市监察局在调查报告中说，上述事实的发生，足以说明该商店领导上平时对营业员缺乏经常的社会主义商业工作人员的道德品质教育，尤其是法制观点的教育。但是身为国家商店营业人员竟无视国家法律侵犯人权，这种恶劣行为当时确实引起了在场许多群众的愤慨，并且给党与政府造成极坏的政治影响，严重地损害了国营商业的威信。
    但考虑到那个顾客是个神经病患者而且当时正是处在发作时期，有危害公物的可能性，营业人员是在维护国家财产以防遭到损失情况下，采取了粗暴的打人行为的，因此可以不给以法律制裁。但为挽回影响，教育本人及全体营业人员，经市商业局决定给予踢打顾客的刘林瑞以行政记过处分。对索取绳子要捆绑并且抽打患者的李洪增给予行政警告处分。
    为了就这一事件教育全体商业人员，吉林省四平市人民委员会并且发了通报。
