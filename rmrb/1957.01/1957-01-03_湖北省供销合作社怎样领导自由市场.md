How the Hubei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Leads the Free Market
    Tang Da

    Since Hubei Province implemented the policy of relaxing rural market management in June 1956, it has made some achievements. After the opening of the free market, the varieties of native products purchased by supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have increased by thirty to three hundred and fifty kinds. The sales of some slow-moving commodities have been restored and expanded, and the enthusiasm of farmers to develop local specialties has been enhanced. Farmers' trade has also become active. Farmers in Junchuan District, Sui County, freely traded more than eighty kinds of small local products through the trading market, accounting for about 40% of the local native product turnover. The operation and management of state-owned commercial and production departments have also been improved to some extent after the opening of the market. The variety of market commodities is increasing with the market's activity. These situations show that the development of the free market in various parts of Hubei is basically normal.

    In the process of opening up the free market, the supply and marketing cooperatives in Hubei have grasped the following key links:

    Clarifying the Market Management Policy

    In order to open the free market in a planned and prepared manner, the Hubei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative conducted education on the new market management policy among cadres in the supply and marketing cooperative system. It clearly stated that under the leadership of the state, a certain range of free market would be opened, allowing partial self-production and self-sales of local and special products, and abolishing the overly restrictive and rigid purchasing and sales measures in market management.

    After the initial opening of the market, some places, combined with the actual situation, conducted ideological education among cadres by means of comparative accounting. Some regions conducted three comparative educations: comparing production growth before and after the opening of the market; comparing market activity; and comparing commodity increases. Through accounting, cadres realized the benefits of opening the free market and the existing problems. The supply and marketing cooperative again took stock of all the local products in the province, dividing the commodities into three categories: fifteen kinds of agricultural and sideline products purchased by the state, and twenty-six kinds of agricultural and sideline products uniformly purchased by state-owned companies or supply and marketing cooperatives, accounting for about 80% of the total turnover of agricultural and sideline products in the province; the rest are products that are allowed to be freely purchased and sold, accounting for about 20% of the total turnover of agricultural and sideline products in the province. After accounting, the scope of commodity opening was announced, and publicity was carried out among farmers and vendors. Merchants in Xiangyang reflected that after the opening of the market, there were "more boats and more oars." After understanding the policy of relaxing market management, Huaguang Store bought 1,000 oil shoe nails from Gucheng County to supply local needs. The Laifeng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized a large number of people to go deep into agricultural cooperatives to carry out publicity, and in conjunction with the exhibition of small local product samples, signed purchase and sales contracts with 205 agricultural cooperatives, helping the agricultural cooperatives to expand sideline income by more than 920,000 yuan.

    In order to expand commodity purchase and sales in a guided manner, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have also taken stock of and prioritized all the commodities to be purchased, and stipulated that the following principles should be followed for the purchase of general local products and sideline products: The state purchases products that the country needs and that are highly technical, or that have low technical requirements but are insufficient in output and basically balanced in production and sales; the state should purchase products that have no technical requirements but have higher output than sales in a planned way; products that are produced but not sold will not be purchased. Changyang County listed 362 kinds of small local products for purchase at listed prices, 21 kinds of self-produced and self-sold products by farmers, 10 kinds that were not collected or stopped being collected, and other commodities that were purchased in a planned manner but not listed. The result of guided purchase has both expanded the variety of purchases and prevented and reduced blind and indiscriminate collection.

    Correctly Implementing Price Policies

    After universally reviewing the purchase and sale prices of small local products, the prices of some small local products were reasonably adjusted. Sui County increased the prices of 54 kinds of small local products (which were too low in the past) and lowered the prices of 23 kinds of small local products (which were too high in the past). Basically, the phenomenon of low purchase prices was corrected, stimulating farmers' enthusiasm for production. The Xianning County Supply and Marketing Cooperative could not collect Baiqian grass in the past, but after adjusting the price, it collected 500 jin in one day.

    After adjusting prices, it was found that some regions had relaxed management of the prices of certain unified purchase and unified acquisition commodities, and the prices of freely purchased and sold commodities had risen relatively more. For this reason, the following management principles were clarified: All commodities that are subject to state unified purchase and unified acquisition must be bought and sold at the state's listed prices, and no locality may arbitrarily change them; commodities that are freely purchased and sold are allowed to be freely priced, and state-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives should lead the free market through commodity purchase and sales. At present, the phenomenon of indiscriminately raising the listed prices of unified purchase commodities has been basically overcome. The prices of freely purchased and sold commodities have both risen and fallen; after the prices of some commodities rose, they fell again. After Shashi's non-staple foods had a relatively sufficient supply of goods, the prices of 23 kinds of non-staple foods fell. After the Junchuan District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Sui County vigorously carried out purchase and sales work, the prices of commodities in the free market generally revolved around the listed prices of the supply and marketing cooperative; especially for commodities with sufficient supply controlled by the supply and marketing cooperative, the prices were even more stable.

    Improving Market Management

    Farmers' own products, except for those varieties subject to state unified purchase and unified acquisition, can be freely sold. Commodities subject to unified purchase and unified acquisition can also be freely traded by farmers after completing the state's unified purchase tasks. Farmers' trade in Hubei takes the following four forms: One is the farmers' exchange, which introduces or acts as an agent for farmers to sell freely purchased and sold products. According to incomplete statistics from 36 counties, there are 324 places for trading native products and livestock. The Badong Yesanguan Farmers' Exchange traded 1,094 yuan of livestock in five days in November 1956, exceeding the highest transaction volume in 1952 by 56.3%. The second is a trading market directly led by the state, organizing farmers to sell surplus products after completing unified purchase and unified acquisition tasks. According to incomplete statistics from the Xiaogan Prefecture, 133 grain markets have been established. In 86 markets in Xiaogan County and other places, more than 2.96 million jin of grain were put on the market in half a month. In addition to more than 65,000 jin of grain that were traded and exchanged on the spot, more than 2.9 million jin of grain were purchased on behalf of the state. The third is a small-scale materials exchange meeting organized by grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives. The exchange meetings organized by four grassroots cooperatives in Huanglong, Yun County, and other places completed transactions worth more than 142,000 yuan, with the highest transaction volume in agricultural cooperatives reaching more than 13,000 yuan, which greatly facilitated the mutual trade of farmers in mountainous areas. The fourth is that farmers freely go to the market and mutually adjust freely purchased and sold products, eliminating unnecessary restrictions between regions. An agricultural cooperative in the mountainous area of ​​Enshi County lacked potato seeds, and through this trade method, it exchanged for more than 20,000 jin of potato seeds.

    In addition to purchasing part of the state's unified purchase and unified acquisition commodities on behalf of the state, small merchants can freely purchase and sell other agricultural and sideline products. Small merchants in Qijiawan, Huangpi County, purchased 115 kinds of local and sideline products and small general merchandise to meet market needs. Many rural small merchants send goods to the city, and small merchants in towns also send a large number of goods to the countryside. In the Lushi District of Tianmen County, 75 shoulder-pole vendors went to the countryside to sell industrial products and purchase small local products.

    The raw materials needed by handicrafts, except for materials purchased and acquired in a unified way and distributed according to plan, other materials are allowed to be freely purchased by handicraft producers. Handicraft products are generally self-produced and self-sold, or selected and purchased by state-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives. At present, many iron and wood handicraft cooperatives directly sign sales and exchange contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives.

    Improving market management also requires the establishment of grassroots market management organizations. Sui County at the county and district levels established market management committees under the unified leadership of the county magistrate and district chief, strengthening market management.

    Improving the Operation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives

    For materials subject to state unified purchase and unified acquisition, supply and marketing cooperatives allocate them according to plan; other commodities can be freely purchased and sold by supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels. For some commodities purchased in a unified way, county cooperatives can directly hand them over to foreign trade companies or factories according to the distribution plan. The procurement business at the provincial and county levels implements a system of "unified profits and losses, shared profits," which promotes the improvement of business relations between upper and lower-level cooperatives.

    On the basis of doing a good job in investigation and research, supply and marketing cooperatives signed combined contracts with agricultural cooperatives and adopted the method of door-to-door purchase. According to incomplete statistics from 12 counties, more than 1,000 various contracts have been signed, totaling more than 1.04 million yuan. The director of the Sixth District Cooperative of Badong County led the staff to the countryside and purchased more than 1,000 jin of papaya in one day.

    Supply and marketing cooperatives have begun to implement free selection and purchase of some small commodities and other industrial products. If state-owned companies lack commodities or the specifications are not suitable, grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives are allowed to go out to purchase, which strengthens the relationship between state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives, and is conducive to increasing the supply of commodities.

    After doing the above work, the free market in Hubei Province has played a role in supplementing the state market. However, new problems have also emerged—what should be managed has been relaxed, and what should not be managed has been managed. Some regions have opened up commodities that should not be opened, while others that should be opened have not been opened. Some agricultural cooperatives and farmers have opened shops to sell commodities. (For example, some agricultural cooperatives in Yuxin District of Tianmen County opened shops in 12 markets. Some agricultural cooperatives in Yingshan County sold Nan bamboo. Some agricultural cooperatives in Huanggang County opened bamboo and wood shops.) Some units raised prices to compete for commodities purchased in a unified way by the state (for example, in Puqi County, the market price of Nan bamboo exceeded the listed price by one time, resulting in excessive felling of mother bamboo in some areas, which affected next year's production).

    These problems affect the normal development of the free market and are not conducive to producers and consumers. The Provincial People's Committee held a symposium for commissioners and county magistrates in key areas, criticizing the two deviations of excessively strict market management and laissez-faire, further clarifying the scope of management and opening up, and decided to further implement measures to soundly develop farmers' trade and improve market management.

    湖北省供销合作社怎样领导自由市场
    唐达
    湖北省自1956年6月贯彻执行放宽农村市场管理的方针以来，已经做出了一些成绩。在开放自由市场以后，各地供销社收购的土产品品种增加了三十种到三百五十种。若干滞销商品已经恢复和扩大了销路，农民发展土特产的积极性提高了。农民贸易也随着活跃起来了。随县均川区农民通过交易市场自由成交小土产八十多种，占当地土产交易额的40％左右。国营商业和生产部门的经营管理，在开放市场后也作了一些改进。市场商品的品种，随着市场的活跃而日益增多。这些情况说明，湖北各地自由市场的发展基本上是正常的。
    湖北各地供销合作社在开放自由市场的过程中抓住了以下几个环节：
    明确市场管理方针
    为了有计划、有准备地开放自由市场，湖北省供销合作社曾在供销社系统干部中进行了市场管理新方针的教育。向大家明确提出：在国家领导下，开放一定范围内的自由市场，允许部分土特产品自产自销，取消市场管理上限制过严过死的购销措施。
    在初步开放市场以后，有些地方又结合实际情况，在干部中用对比算帐的方式进行思想教育。一些地区进行了三项对比的教育：开放市场前后生产增长的对比；市场活跃情况的对比；商品增加情况的对比。通过算帐，干部体会到了开放自由市场的好处和存在的问题。供销社又把全省的土产品摸了一次底，把商品分为三类：由国家统购的农副产品十五种，国家委托国营公司或供销合作社统一收购的农副产品二十六种，以上两类约占全省农副产品交易额的80％左右；其他是允许自由购销的产品，约占全省农副产品交易额的20％左右。经过算帐，公布了商品开放的范围，并对农民和商贩进行了宣传。襄阳商贩反映开放市场后是“船多桨又多”。华光商店了解了放宽市场管理的政策后，到谷城县买回油鞋钉一千个，供应当地需要。来凤县供销社组织大批人员深入农业社进行宣传，并结合小土产样品展览，和二百零五个农业社订立购销合同，帮助农业社扩大副业收入九十二万多元。
    各地供销合作社为了有领导地扩大商品购销，又对所有要收购的商品进行了一次摸底、排队，并规定对一般土产和副业产品的收购要掌握以下原则：国家需要而生产技术性大的产品，或者生产技术小而产量不足和产销基本平衡的产品，国家都收购起来；生产没有技术性而产大于销的，国家要有计划地进行收购；有产无销的，不收购。长阳县挂牌价收购的小土产有三百六十二种，农民自产自销的有二十一种，未收和停收的有十种，其他是有计划地进行收购而未挂牌的商品。有领导地收购的结果，既扩大了收购的品种，又防止和减少了盲目滥收的情况。
    正确执行价格政策
    在普遍地审查了小土产品的购销价格以后，便合理地调整了部分小土产品的价格。随县提高了五十四种小土产品的价格（过去偏低），调低了二十三种小土产品价格（过去偏高）。基本上纠正了收购价偏低的现象，刺激了农民的生产积极性。咸宁县供销社过去收不到白前草，在调整价格后一天就收了五百斤。
    在调整价格以后，又发现有的地区对某些统购和统一收购的商品的价格放松了管理，自由购销的商品的价格上涨的较多。为此，又明确规定了这样的管理原则：凡属国家统购和统一收购的商品，必须按照国家牌价买卖，各地不得任意变动；自由购销的商品，允许自由定价，国营商业和供销社应该通过商品购销领导自由市场。目前，滥提统一收购商品牌价的现象基本上已克服了。自由购销商品的价格，有涨有跌；若干商品涨价以后又回跌了。沙市副食品有了比较充足的货源以后，便有二十三种副食品价格回跌。随县均川区供销社大力开展购销工作以后，自由市场上商品的价格一般是围绕在供销社牌价的周围；特别是供销社掌握了充足货源的商品，价格更是稳定。
    改进市场管理工作
    农民自己的产品，除国家统购和统一收购的品种以外，可以自由出售。统购和统一收购的商品，在完成国家统购的任务以后，农民也可以自由交易。湖北的农民贸易有以下四种形式：一种是农民交易所，介绍或代理农民出售自由购销的产品。据三十六个县不完整的统计，共有土产和牲畜交易场所三百二十四个。巴东野三关农民交易所，在1956年11月的五天中，交易牲畜一千零九十四元，超过1952年最高交易额的56.3％，一种是国家直接领导的交易市场，组织农民出售完成统购和统一收购任务以后的多余产品。据孝感专区不完全统计，已建立粮食市场一百三十三个。孝感县等地八十六个市场，半月内上市粮食二百九十六万多斤，除当场成交和互换的六万五千多斤外，还代国家收购了二百九十万斤多粮食。一种是基层供销合作社组织的小型物资交流会。郧县黄龙等四个基层合作社组织的交流会，成交了十四万二千多元，在农业社中交易最多的达一万三千多元，大大便利了山区农民的相互交易。一种是农民自由赶集和相互调剂允许自由购销的产品，取消地区间不必要的限制。恩施县大山区的一个农业社，缺洋芋种，通过这种贸易方式，换进二万多斤洋芋种。
    小商贩除可以为国家代购部分统购和统一收购的商品外，对其他农副产品可以自由购销。黄陂县祁家塆小商贩采购了土副产品和小百杂货一百十五种，供应市场需要。不少农村小商贩送商品进城，城镇的小商贩也大量送货下乡去。天门县芦市区有七十五付担子下乡出售工业品和收购小土产。
    手工业所需用的原料，除统购和统一收购的物资按计划分配外，其他的允许手工业生产者自由采购。手工业的产品，一般是自产自销，或者由国营商业和供销社选购。现有不少铁、木手工业社，直接和供销社订立销售和包换合同。
    改进市场管理工作，还需要成立基层市场管理机构。随县县区两级在县长和区长统一领导下成立了市场管理委员会，加强了市场管理工作。
    改进供销社的经营
    凡属国家统购和统一收购的物资，供销社按计划调拨；其他商品各级供销社可以自由购销。有些统一收购的商品，县社可以根据分配计划直接交给外贸公司或工厂。省、县两级的采购业务，实行“统一盈亏，共分利润”的制度，促使上下级社改善了经营关系。
    供销社在做好调查研究工作的基础上，同农业社订立结合合同，并采用登门收购的办法。据十二个县不完全统计，已签订各种合同一千多份，共计金额一百零四万多元。巴东县六区社主任带领工作人员下乡，一天就收购木瓜一千多斤。
    供销合作社已经开始对部分小百货等工业品实行自由选购。国营公司缺少或规格不适合的商品，允许基层供销社外出采购，这就密切了国营商业和供销合作社的关系，有利于增加商品的供应。
    做了以上工作以后，湖北省的自由市场已经起了补充国家市场的作用。但是，也出现了新的问题——该管的放松了，不该管的管了。有些地区把不该开放的商品开放了，应该开放的又没有开放。部分农业社和农民开设店铺，贩卖商品。（如：天门县渔薪区部分农业社在十二个集场上开设店铺。英山县部分农业社贩卖南竹。黄冈县部分农业社开竹木行。）有些单位抬价争购国家统一收购的商品（如蒲圻县南竹市价超过牌价一倍，以致部分地区砍伐母竹过多，影响明年生产）。
    这些问题，都影响到自由市场的正常发展，也不利于生产者和消费者。省人民委员会曾召开了重点区专员和县长座谈会，批判了对市场管理过死和放任自流的两种偏向，进一步明确地指出了管理和开放的范围，决定进一步贯彻执行健全发展农民贸易和改进市场管理的措施。
