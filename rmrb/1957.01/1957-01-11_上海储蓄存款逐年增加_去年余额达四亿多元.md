Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd. Shanghai's savings deposit balance reached more than 460 million yuan last year. This money is enough to build twelve spinning factories with 90,000 spindles.

Shanghai workers are already important bank depositors. Last year, the savings deposit balance of five factory districts accounted for about 13% of the city's total. Many workers also save in their residential areas. Last year, more than 6,200 worker families living in Caoyang New Village opened more than 4,890 deposit accounts in the bank.

According to statistics from the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China, Shanghai's savings deposits have increased year by year since 1949. Last year's deposit balance increased by one-fifth compared to the previous year.
