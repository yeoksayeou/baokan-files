    Learning a Lesson from the Milk Powder Shortage
    Commentator of this newspaper
    Starting from the third quarter of last year, milk powder has been out of stock in various places. In early November 1956, this newspaper published an article by Comrade Zhu Youren of the China Sugar, Tobacco & Wine Company entitled "Why is Milk Powder Out of Stock?", explaining that at a meeting held by the China General Merchandise Company in February of last year to arrange supply work for the second and third quarters, it failed to fully estimate changes in social needs. It subjectively believed that milk powder was a slow-moving and unsalable commodity with limited sales and ample production sources, available on demand, and was unwilling to purchase more milk powder in the second and third quarters (at that time, the purchase volume of commercial departments accounted for only 38% of the supply capacity). In order to prevent excessive milk powder accumulation, the food industry department had to reduce prices to promote sales, strive for exports, and even reduce production.
    However, the person in charge of the China Sugar, Tobacco & Wine Company (who was originally responsible for milk powder distribution at the China General Merchandise Company) and other personnel in the commercial departments disagreed with the article's arguments. They believed that attributing the main reason for the milk powder shortage to the subjectivism of business management personnel in commercial departments was incorrect; although there were shortcomings in the work of the commercial departments, the milk powder shortage was greatly related to the poor quality of the milk powder.
    It is not objectionable for commercial departments to not purchase or purchase less milk powder of poor quality in order to protect the masses, especially the health of infants, and to urge production departments to improve product quality. In the past, the quality of milk powder produced by factories in Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places was indeed poor. However, commercial departments did not fully purchase even the milk powder with the best quality. The "Red Star" brand milk powder produced by the Anda Dairy Factory in Heilongjiang Province is produced using a spray-drying milk dryer, with a solubility of over 97%, making it the best milk powder for infants in the country. However, according to the person in charge of the Anda Dairy Factory, their factory's production volume is very large (the production volume in the first half of last year was equivalent to the production volume of the entire previous year). Due to the commercial departments' failure to vigorously purchase the product, a lot of their milk powder accumulated. Therefore, they had to adopt measures such as reducing prices for sales and striving for exports to solve the problem of milk powder accumulation. The Anda Dairy Factory is not only the factory with the best technology and equipment among the national dairy factories, but also the factory with the largest production volume. Last year, the factory's milk powder production was 765 tons, accounting for more than one-quarter of the national total output, while the commercial departments purchased approximately only 40% of the factory's production volume.
    The milk powder shortage has had a very negative impact on the broad masses (especially infants), on milk powder production and animal husbandry, and on commercial work itself. We should really learn from this incident.
    We believe that an important reason for the milk powder shortage is that the responsible persons of the relevant commercial departments failed to consider the changes in the consumption needs of the broad masses based on the new situation of socialist transformation and national economic construction development.
    In the past, the masses' demand for milk powder was not large, and in some areas, the commercial departments' milk powder inventory was too large, and there was even accumulation. This is a fact. However, we must not ignore another fact, which is that: due to the high tide of socialist transformation that appeared in our country from the end of 1955 to the beginning of 1956, and due to the rapid development of national economic construction, the state implemented wage reform, and the lives of workers and staff have been further improved. Therefore, the masses' demand for milk powder, like the demand for other commodities, is higher in terms of both quality and quantity than in the past; the supply-demand relationship of milk powder, like that of several other commodities closely related to people's lives, is not easing but becoming tense. This fact tells commercial workers, especially the leading personnel of commercial departments, that they must have foresight when considering the work of their departments. When formulating commodity supply plans, they should not only look backward but should look forward; they should not only consider the sales situation in the past market but must consider the changes caused by national construction development in people's lives. Otherwise, it is inevitable that they will be confused by the local phenomena of the supply-demand relationship of a certain time, a certain place, and a certain object.
    Of course, commercial work is very complex, and it was difficult to fully estimate the tense situation in the supply and demand of milk powder that began in the third quarter of last year in advance. Therefore, the purpose of discussing the milk powder shortage now is only to hope that more people in the commercial departments will learn a lesson from it. However, Zhu Youren's opinions published in the newspaper were not valued by the person in charge of the China Sugar, Tobacco & Wine Company (milk powder was previously managed by the China General Merchandise Company and has now been transferred to the China Sugar, Tobacco & Wine Company), and they have always held this attitude: "Today we examine subjectivism, and tomorrow milk powder will still not be available on the streets." At the same time, they gave Zhu Youren undue blame and criticism. At the end of December 1956, the person in charge of the China Sugar, Tobacco & Wine Company and the company's party branch even convened a meeting of one or twenty people and spent two days "correcting" Zhu Youren's one-sided views, accusing Zhu Youren of "stealing other people's labor" when writing manuscripts with his own views. This attitude towards criticism and critics is wrong.

    从奶粉脱销吸取教训
    本报评论员
    从去年第三季度起，各地奶粉都脱销了。1956年11月初，本报发表了中国糖业糕点公司朱有仁同志写的文章“奶粉为什么脱销”，说明中国百货公司在去年2月份为安排第二、三季度供应工作召开的会议上，没有充分估计社会需要的变化，主观地认为奶粉是冷背滞销商品，销售量有限，生产来源充足，可以随要随到，不愿意在二、三季度多购进奶粉（当时商业部门的进货数量只占供应能力的38％）。食品工业部门为了防止奶粉积压过多，不得不减价推销，争取出口，甚至减少生产。
    但是，中国糖业糕点公司的负责人（原来在百货公司负责奶粉分配工作的）和商业部门其他一些人员却不同意文章的论点。他们认为把奶粉脱销的主要原因归于商业部门经管人员的主观主义是不对的；商业部门的工作有缺点，但奶粉脱销和奶粉的质量不好却有很大的关系。
    商业部门对于质量不好的奶粉不进货或者少进货，以便保护群众，特别是保护幼儿的健康，并督促生产部门提高产品质量，这是无可非议的。过去天津、青岛等地工厂生产的奶粉质量也确实是不好的。但是，质量最好的奶粉，商业部门也没有全收购。黑龙江安达乳粉厂出产的“红星”牌奶粉，是用喷雾式牛奶烘干机生产的，溶解度达到97％以上，是全国幼儿食用的最好的一种奶粉。可是，据安达乳粉厂的负责人反映，他们工厂的生产量很大（去年上半年的生产量相当前年一年的生产量），由于商业部门没有大力进货，他们生产的奶粉积压了很多。因此，他们不得不采取减价销售、争取出口等等办法来解决奶粉积压的问题。安达乳粉厂不仅是全国乳粉厂中技术设备最好的工厂，也是生产量最大的工厂，去年这个工厂的奶粉产量七百六十五吨，占全国总产量四分之一以上，而商业部门购进的大约只是这个厂生产量的40％。
    奶粉脱销对于广大群众（特别是幼儿），对于奶粉生产和牧畜业，对于商业工作本身，都发生了很不好的影响，实在应该从这件事中吸取经验教训。
    我们觉得奶粉脱销的一个重要原因，就是有关商业部门的负责人没有根据社会主义改造和国家经济建设发展的新情况，来考虑广大群众消费需要的变化。
    过去，群众对奶粉的需要量并不大，有些地区商业部门的奶粉库存量却过大，甚至有积压现象。这是事实。但是绝不能忽视另一个事实，这就是：由于1955年底到1956年初在我国出现了社会主义改造的高潮，由于国家经济建设有了迅速的发展，国家实行工资改革，职工生活有了进一步的提高，因此，群众对于奶粉的需要正像对其他商品的需要一样，在质和量方面都比过去要求更高了；奶粉的供求关系也像其他若干种和人民生活息息相关的商品一样，不是缓和而是紧张起来了。这个事实告诉了商业工作人员，特别是商业部门的领导人员，在考虑本部门工作的时候，必须要有远见。在制定商品供应计划的时候，不能只是向后看，而是应该向前看；不可仅仅考虑过去市场上的销售情况，而是必须考虑国家建设发展在人民生活上所引起的变化。否则，就难免被一时、一地、一物的供求关系的局部现象所迷惑。
    当然，商业工作是很复杂的，对于去年第三季度开始的奶粉供求上的紧张状况，事先是难于完全估计到的。因此，现在来谈奶粉脱销的问题，目的也只是希望商业部门有更多的人从这里吸取教训。但是，朱有仁在报纸上发表的意见，中国糖业糕点公司（奶粉过去由中国百货公司经营，现在已经划归中国糖业糕点公司经营）负责人并未加以重视，他们一直抱着这种态度：“今天我们检讨了主观主义，明天街上也买不到奶粉”。同时他们还给朱有仁以不应有的责备和批评。中国糖业糕点公司和公司党支部的负责人在1956年12月底竟然召开了有一、二十人参加的会议，用两天的时间来“纠正”朱有仁的片面观点，指责朱有仁写的具有自己的观点的稿件是“窃取他人的劳动”。这种对待批评和对待批评者的态度是错误的。
