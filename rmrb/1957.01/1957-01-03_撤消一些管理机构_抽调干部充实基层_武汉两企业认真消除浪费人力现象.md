    Abolish Some Management Organizations, Transfer Cadres to Strengthen Grassroots
    Two Enterprises in Wuhan Seriously Eliminate Waste of Manpower

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Road Engineering Company on the construction site of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex has streamlined its department structure and transferred cadres to strengthen the construction site.

    The Road Engineering Company is responsible for building railways and highways within the Wugang construction area, covering an area of tens of square kilometers. However, the Railway Engineering Team, Pavement Engineering Team, and Subgrade Engineering Team, which directly lead the on-site construction under the company, each had only one deputy captain. Under the complicated circumstances of construction management, material supply, and administrative welfare, they were overwhelmed and unable to delve into the construction site. On the other hand, some departments in the company's fourteen sections had little daily work. The company's leading cadres studied and collected the opinions of the workers and decided to abolish four sections, merge them into other sections with related business, and transfer some cadres to strengthen the three engineering teams and the technically complex technical section.

    After this adjustment, the phenomenon of the company's organization being top-heavy has been changed to some extent. Now, the three engineering teams are equipped with three deputy captains, who are responsible for administrative welfare, engineering technology, and material supply, respectively. They can often spend about half of their time on the construction site to solve problems. Some phenomena of uneven workload in the company's departments have also gradually been eliminated.

    This newspaper reports that the Wuhan No. 1 State-owned Cotton Mill reduced and transferred 21.32% of its original cadres last year. However, the factory's production has improved significantly compared to the past.

    The factory rectified and improved its labor organization last year and streamlined its institutions. The Labor Protection and Welfare Section and the General Affairs Section were merged into the Public Affairs Section; the large Production Section was abolished, and the Chief Engineer's Office and the Planning Section were strengthened. The number of management personnel was also reduced accordingly. For example, the Finance Section was reduced from twenty-one people to fifteen, and the Mechanical and Electrical Section was reduced from seventeen to nine. A large number of technical personnel and management personnel were transferred to support new factories and strengthen the grassroots.

    Since 1955, the factory's trade union has reduced its full-time cadres from sixteen to four, making it the factory with the fewest trade union cadres in Wuhan's cotton mills. Before the streamlining of cadres, although the office was crowded with people who were extremely busy, the work was not as good as it is now. In the past, full-time cadres took care of everything, with a pile of affairs, while grassroots trade union cadres and activists felt that they had nothing to do. During last year's production upsurge, the trade union, with the support of the Party committee, transferred matters belonging to administrative business to the administration for handling, freeing itself from the encirclement of daily affairs. The four full-time cadres were assigned tasks, focusing their energy on strengthening the leadership of grassroots work and giving full play to the role of activists. They went deep into the workshops, cultivated typical examples, and summarized and exchanged experiences on how trade union groups organized advanced workers to lead backward workers, specifically helped workers achieve guarantee conditions, and cared about the lives of the masses. Therefore, most of the one hundred and ninety trade union group leaders, whose work was relatively inactive in the past, are now familiar with their work and have a clear sense of direction, playing a significant role. The seven hundred and eleven worker activists who emerged during the production upsurge have become the most active force in connecting with the masses and implementing the Party committee's resolutions. The higher-level trade union gave a very high evaluation of the work here.

    The person in charge of the No. 1 State-owned Cotton Mill said that their boldness in reducing cadres and streamlining institutions was inseparable from the inspiration they received from the trade union's facts. After the welfare department reduced twenty-eight cadres last year, the phenomenon of no one being responsible was greatly reduced. In the past, the Mechanical and Electrical Section was often criticized by the youth supervision post because it had too many people, complicated procedures, and delayed work. After reducing personnel and establishing a responsibility system, this section was often praised by workers because it could go deep into the workshop and meet the needs of the workshop in a more timely manner. They believe that as long as the streamlining of institutions is combined with the establishment of systems and the full use of the role of the masses, work will not only not be weakened, but will be done better and more deeply. The factory is still conducting investigations and studies and plans to continue to streamline institutions and cadres.

### 撤消一些管理机构　抽调干部充实基层  武汉两企业认真消除浪费人力现象

    撤消一些管理机构　抽调干部充实基层
    武汉两企业认真消除浪费人力现象
    据新华社讯　武汉钢铁联合企业工地上的道路工程公司，精简科室机构，抽调干部充实了施工现场。
    道路工程公司负责修筑武钢建筑区内的铁路和公路，施工范围达几十平方公里。但是公司下面直接领导现场施工的铁路工程队、路面工程队和路基工程队，都只有一个副队长，他们在繁杂的施工管理、材料供应和行政福利等工作情况下面，顾此失彼，不能深入工地；而公司机关里十四个科室中的有些科，日常工作却不多。公司的领导干部研究和搜集了职工们的意见，决定撤销四个科，并入同业务相关的其他科里，抽调出一部分干部充实了三个工程队和业务比较复杂的技术科。
    经过这样的调整，公司机构上头重脚轻的现象已经有所改变。现在，三个工程队都配备了三个副队长，他们分工管理行政福利、工程技术和材料供应等工作，经常能有一半左右的时间到施工现场去解决问题。公司科室里某些闲忙不均等现象也逐渐消除了。
    本报讯　武汉国棉一厂去年减少下来向外输送的干部占原有干部的21.32％。而全厂生产却比过去有很大改进。
    这个厂在去年整顿和改进了劳动组织，精简了机构。劳保福利科和总务科合并成为公共事业科；撤销了庞大的生产科，充实了总工程师办公室和计划科。管理人员也相应减少，如财务科由二十一人减为十五人，机物科由十七人减为九人。成批的技术人员、管理人员被输送出去支援新厂和充实基层。
    这个厂的工会从1955年以来，把专职干部从十六人减为四人，现在是武汉市各纱厂工会干部最少的厂。工会在没精简干部以前，虽然办公室里的人济济一堂，忙得不可开交，但是还不如现在的工作做得好。过去是专职干部包揽一切，事务一大堆，工会的基层干部和积极分子却感到没事干。在去年生产高潮中，工会取得党委的支持，把属于行政业务的事划归了行政处理，摆脱了日常事务的包围。四个专职干部作了分工，集中精力，加强对基层工作的领导，充分发挥积极分子的作用。他们深入车间，培养典型，总结交流了工会小组如何组织先进带动落后、具体帮助工人实现保证条件、关心群众生活等经验。因此，过去工作比较沉寂的一百九十个工会小组长，现在绝大部分熟悉了业务，工作方向明确，发挥了很大的作用。在生产高潮中涌现出来的七百一十一个工人积极分子，成为联系群众、贯彻党委决议的一支最活跃的力量。上级工会对这里的工作给予了很高的评价。
    国棉一厂负责人说，他们之所以大胆减少干部、精简机构，是与受到工会的事实的启发分不开的。福利部门去年减少了二十八个干部，无人负责的现象反到大大减少。机物科过去因为人员太多，手续繁琐，工作拖延，常常遭到青年监督岗的批评。减少人员，建立责任制以后，这个科因为能深入车间，比较及时地满足了车间需要，常常受到工人的赞扬。他们认为，只要把精简机构与建立制度、充分发挥群众作用结合起来，工作不仅不会削弱，而且会做得更好、更深入。这个厂现在还在进行调查研究、打算继续精简机构和干部。
