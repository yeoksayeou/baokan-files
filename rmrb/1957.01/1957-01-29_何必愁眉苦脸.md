Why the Long Face?
　　In agricultural production, regardless of the conditions, blindly promoting new production technologies without discrimination is a form of blindness. Similarly, negating all the production technologies that have already been implemented without distinguishing between success and failure or understanding the reasons for success and failure, even to the point of wearing a long face and being afraid to move forward, is also a form of blindness. The best way to overcome blindness is to conduct a specific analysis of things.
　　According to Xinhua News Agency reports, Xinfan County in Sichuan Province promoted more than ten new agricultural technologies in 1956 and advocated the planting of double-cropping rice. As a result, the county's total grain production increased by more than 5%, but there were also individual areas where the increase was small or even decreased. Therefore, some people could not distinguish between right and wrong and could not find their direction. Some agricultural technicians also became negative and were embarrassed to go to the countryside to promote and guide. In response to this situation, each township and cooperative mobilized farmers to summarize and evaluate various agricultural technologies. The secretary of the Xinfan County Party Committee also went to Hedeng Township, where agricultural technology promotion was widespread, to help and promote this work.
　　After repeated investigations, research, and analysis, the final conclusion was: some agricultural technologies, such as wide-row strip planting and dense planting of wheat, have achieved significant yield increases and can be widely promoted; planting double-cropping rice and most agricultural technologies, such as appropriate dense planting of rice, transplanting with shovels, and planting rice seedlings with manure, can also achieve yield increases, but they must be promoted according to local conditions; a small number of agricultural technologies, such as potato hotbed sprouting, although very effective, are difficult to master appropriately and the cost is relatively high, so it is still difficult to promote them on a large scale at present; in addition, intercropping corn in rapeseed fields, where the corn seedlings are shaded by the dense rapeseed and do not grow well, is currently not suitable for large-scale promotion. After the summary and evaluation, the cadres who were originally wearing long faces gained confidence and became more active in their work.

    何必愁眉苦脸
    在农业生产上，不管条件怎样，拿来新的生产技术就胡乱推行，这是盲目性；对于已经推行的各种生产技术，不分成败、不弄清成败的原因，而一概加以否定，甚至愁眉苦脸，不敢再前进了，同样是盲目性。克服盲目性的最好办法，就是对于事物作一番具体的分析工作。
    据新华社报道，四川省新繁县在1956年内推广了十多项新的农业技术，并且提倡了种植双季稻。结果，全县粮食增产5％以上，但是也有个别地方增产不多或者减产。因此，有些人分不清是非，摸不清方向。一些农业技术干部也消极起来，不好意思下乡作宣传指导。根据这种情况，各乡、各社就发动农民对各项农业技术进行总结鉴定，新繁县委书记还到农业技术推广面较宽的禾登乡，帮助和推动这一工作。
    经过反复的调查研究和分析，最后得出的结论是：一部分农业技术如小麦宽幅条播密植等，增产成绩显著，可以大量推广；种植双季稻，以及大部分农业技术如水稻适当密植、栽铲秧、栽包粪秧等，也都能够获得增产，但是必须因地制宜地推广；一小部分农业技术如洋芋温床催芽，虽然效果很好，但是很难掌握适当，成本也比较高，现在就大量推广还有困难；另外，如在油菜田里间种玉米，玉米出苗的时候被茂密的油菜遮去阳光而长不大，目前不宜大量推广。经过总结鉴定，原先愁眉苦脸的干部有了信心，工作积极了。
