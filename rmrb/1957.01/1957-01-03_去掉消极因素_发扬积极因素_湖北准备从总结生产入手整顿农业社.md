Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan – Hubei Province is preparing to rectify agricultural production cooperatives to further motivate members and consolidate the achievements of agricultural cooperation.

In 1956, the natural conditions for agriculture in Hubei Province were average. However, due to the implementation of advanced agricultural cooperation, the province achieved its largest harvest since liberation. The total grain output increased by 2.2 billion jin compared to the previous year, completing the target for the final year of the First Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. Total cotton output reached 4 million dan (lint cotton), a 30% increase over the previous year. The number of live pigs increased from 2.5 million to 5.5 million, setting a new record for growth in recent years. The province saw the emergence of 1,187 “thousand-jin grain cooperatives,” 506 “hundred-jin cotton cooperatives,” as well as numerous examples of high-yield production of peanuts, sweet potatoes, and other crops. A year prior, only 5% of farming households in the province had joined advanced cooperatives, and most cadres and farmers were unfamiliar with the concept of quota management. After a year of effort, advanced agricultural cooperation was completed throughout the province, with 94% of cooperatives implementing quota management. Cooperatives in various regions have also accumulated considerable experience in establishing labor organizations, implementing financial management, and conducting distribution. However, the management level of many agricultural production cooperatives in Hubei Province is not yet adequate to meet the demands of the broad masses of members for further production development. Many cooperatives still have problems of varying degrees that urgently need to be resolved.

Not long ago, the Rural Work Department of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of the heads of rural work departments of prefectural (municipal) committees, focusing on the issue of cooperative rectification. The meeting held that the purpose of cooperative rectification is to consolidate existing achievements, solve existing problems, remove negative factors, promote positive factors, unite all members, and further improve production. Therefore, the rectification work must be subordinate to production, serve production, and be carried out around production. In terms of approach, it should start with summarizing production, first solving problems that hinder current production. In particular, for the distribution settlement and distribution summary of the cooperatives, it is necessary to properly resolve outstanding issues, correct deviations, and fully embody the principle of distribution according to labor, so as to further encourage the production enthusiasm of the members and widely develop winter production. In production activities, management levels should be raised a step from the existing foundation according to the requirements of the members and in accordance with the specific conditions of each cooperative. Cooperatives should pay attention to summarizing labor management experience, vigorously promote perennial quotas, try piece-rate wages, and effectively improve financial management, further establishing and improving a democratic financial management system. Localities should also, based on specific conditions, improve the ideological understanding of cooperative cadres and members, and after full deliberation and preparation, democratically re-elect the leadership of the cooperatives. The meeting also suggested that local committees convene a county committee rural work department head meeting, and each county committee convene a three-level cadre meeting, in order to improve cadres and enrich leadership through the introduction of typical examples and exchange of experiences to ensure the smooth progress of the cooperative rectification work.

    去掉消极因素　发扬积极因素
    湖北准备从总结生产入手整顿农业社
    据新华社武汉电　湖北省为了进一步调动社员的积极性，巩固农业合作化的成绩，正在准备整顿农业生产合作社。
    1956年湖北省农业的自然条件一般，但是，由于实现了农业高级合作化，获得了解放以来最大的一次丰收。全省粮食总产量比去年增加二十二亿斤，提前一年完成了第一个五年计划最后一年的指标；棉花总产量达到四百万担（皮棉），比去年增加三成；生猪由二百五十万头发展到五百五十万头，创造了近几年来发展速度的新纪录。全省出现了一千一百八十七个粮食“千斤社”，五百零六个棉花“百斤社”，以及不少花生、红薯等农作物的高额丰产典型。一年以前，参加高级社的农户只占全省农户总数的5％，绝大多数干部和农民对定额管理的名词还不了解。经过一年的努力，在全省范围内完成了农业高级合作化，94％的合作社实行了定额管理。各地合作社在建立劳动组织，实行财务管理和进行分配等方面也积累了相当丰富的经验。但是，目前湖北省许多农业生产合作社的经营管理水平，还不能和广大社员进一步发展生产的要求相适应。许多合作社里还存在着或多或少亟待解决的问题。
    不久以前中共湖北省委农村工作部召开的地（市）委农村工作部长会议，着重研究了整社的问题。会议认为，整社的目的是巩固已有的成绩，解决存在的问题，去除消极的因素，发扬积极的因素，团结全体社员，进一步搞好生产。因此整社工作必须服从生产，服务于生产，并且围绕着生产去进行。在作法上，应该从总结生产入手，首先解决障碍当前生产的问题。特别是对于合作社的分配结算和分配总结，要很好地解决遗留问题，纠正偏差，做到完整地体现按劳取酬的原则，这样来进一步鼓舞社员的生产积极性，把冬季生产广泛地开展起来。在生产行动中，应该根据社员的要求，因社制宜地把经营管理的水平从现有的基础上提高一步。各合作社应当注意总结劳动管理的经验，大力推行常年定额，试行按件计酬，并且切实改善财务管理，进一步建立和健全民主管理财务的制度。各地还应当根据具体情况，在提高社干部和社员思想认识的基础上，经过充分酝酿准备以后，民主改选社的领导机构。这次会议还建议各地委召开一次县委农村工作部长会议，各县委召开一次三级干部会议，以便运用介绍典型、交流经验的方式，来提高干部，丰富领导，保证整社工作顺利进行。
