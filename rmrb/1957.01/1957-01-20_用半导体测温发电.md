Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 17th: On January 15th, Shanghai was hit by heavy snow. A technician from the Chuangzao Electrical Instrument Industrial Cooperative inserted an iron pipe, less than a foot long, into the snowdrift. The pointer on the instrument connected to the iron pipe pointed to zero degrees Celsius. He then put the iron pipe into warm water, and the pointer rose to thirty degrees. Both measurements were exactly the same as those taken with a mercury thermometer. This iron pipe is a deep-water thermometer made of semiconductors, recently developed by this cooperative.

The technicians at this cooperative said that this set of thermometers was designed for the Foziling Reservoir. When used to measure the temperature of the water stored in the reservoir, it can accurately measure the temperature of the deep water simply by placing it in the water, without the need for divers, so that measures can be taken to protect the dam before the water freezes. On fishing vessels, this thermometer can also be placed 100 meters deep in the ocean layer with the most fish to measure the temperature, and then use the temperature to find schools of fish.

This cooperative has also recently successfully tested a semiconductor thermoelectric generator. The generator looks a bit like an umbrella, with a kerosene lamp underneath. When the lamp is lit, the generator slowly converts heat energy directly into electrical energy. In about ten minutes, a dry-cell radio next to it starts playing music, with sound just like using dry cells. People in the cooperative say that this generator can also be heated with coal or wood, making it ideal for listening to the radio in areas without electricity.

The use of semiconductors has gained widespread attention in Shanghai in recent years. The Chuangzao Electrical Instrument Industrial Cooperative has used semiconductors to create turbidity meters, photoelectric colorimeters, and other precision instruments, which have been applied by various relevant units in industrial analysis, medical testing, and other fields. The semiconductor photoresistors successfully developed by the Shanghai Precision Medical Instrument Factory have recently been tested in some cotton textile mills and steel rolling mills for controlling cotton roll thickness and automatic steel rolling. In addition, some enterprises are also considering adopting various semiconductors. The Shanghai Post Office is currently studying the use of semiconductor photoresistors to automatically count the number of letters.

    用半导体测温发电
    新华社上海17日电　15日，上海大雪纷飞，创造电工仪器工业社的一位技术人员把一根不满一尺长的铁管，插进了雪堆，同铁管相连的仪表上，指针指在摄氏零度；他又把铁管放入温水，指针就升到三十度。两次测量都同用水银测温计测量的结果完全一样。这个铁管就是这个工业社最近研究成功的用半导体制成的深水测温计。
    这个工业社的技术人员说，这套测温计是为佛子岭水库设计的，用它来测量水库储水的温度时，只要把它放在水里，不需要潜水员下去，就能够正确地测出深水的温度，以便在水结冰之前就采取措施来保护水坝。在渔轮上，这种测温计也可以放到离海面一百公尺深的鱼类最多的海层测温，然后根据温度来寻找鱼群。
    这个工业社最近还试验成功了一种半导体温差发电器。发电器外形有点像伞，下面有一个火油灯，把灯点着，发电器就慢慢地把热能直接变成电能，约十分钟，旁边一个干电收音机就开始播出音乐，声音和用干电完全一样。工业社里的人说，这种发电器也可以用煤炭、木柴来加热，最适宜于没有电力的地方用来收听广播。
    半导体的利用近年来在上海已经引起普遍的重视。创造电工仪器工业社利用半导体制成的浑浊度测定器、光电比色计等多种精密仪器，已经被各个有关单位应用到工业分析、医疗化验等方面。上海精密医疗器械厂研究成功的半导体光敏电阻，最近除了在一些棉纺织厂、轧钢厂试验用来控制棉卷厚薄和自动控制轧钢以外，还有一些企业单位最近也在考虑采用各种半导体。上海市邮局目前正在研究用半导体光敏电阻来自动计算信件的数目。
