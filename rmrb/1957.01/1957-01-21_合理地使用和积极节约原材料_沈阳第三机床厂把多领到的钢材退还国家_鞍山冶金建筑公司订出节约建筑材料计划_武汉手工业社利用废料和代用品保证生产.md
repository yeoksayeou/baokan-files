    Reasonably Use and Actively Conserve Raw Materials
    Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant Returns Excess Steel to the State
    Anshan Metallurgical Construction Company Formulates a Plan for Conserving Building Materials
    Wuhan Handicraft Cooperatives Utilize Waste Materials and Substitutes to Ensure Production
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 19th—The Supervision Office of Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant, adhering to the struggle against departmentalism, has enabled the plant to return excess steel to the state.
    The factory had enough remaining "One-K-Three-Six" lathe main shaft steel from last year to produce this type of lathe's main shafts for the entire year. Due to a lack of communication between the supply and production departments, they requested an additional twenty-one tons of this steel from the state when preparing materials for the first quarter of this year. When the factory's Supervision Office conducted an in-depth inspection of steel usage, they discovered this problem and suggested returning the excess main shaft steel to the state. At this time, some responsible personnel believed that although there was excess of this type of main shaft steel, other specifications of steel were insufficient and that this main shaft steel could be used as a substitute for other specifications, and therefore were not prepared to return it to the state. After research, the Supervision Office believed that many fraternal factories lacked main shaft steel and that appropriating the surplus main shaft steel for themselves to substitute for other specifications of steel was still an expression of departmentalism. Therefore, they reported the problem to the Party General Branch and the factory director. The Party General Branch Secretary and the factory director actively supported the Supervision Office's opinion and criticized the departmentalist thinking of some personnel. Now the factory has returned the excess main shaft steel to the state.
    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan—Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation initially plans to save 1,700 tons of steel and 13,000 tons of cement this year.
    The corporation saved 730 tons of steel and over 10,000 tons of cement last year. Recently, after summarizing their conservation experiences, the company believes that the potential for conservation is still great. This is mainly because since the second half of last year, employees have found many new ways to conserve. For example, the hot rolling mill recently manufactured by labor model Huang Demao and foreman He Yunyi can use waste steel to roll round steel from six to nine millimeters in diameter, rolling 6,000 tons per year. In the past, using the cold drawing method for steel bars could only draw round steel with a diameter of twelve millimeters or less, but now, due to the adoption of some technical measures, even round steel with a diameter of twelve to nineteen millimeters can be cold drawn. In this way, for every 3,000 tons of steel bars processed, more than 200 tons can be saved. A new prestressed steel strand concrete workshop built by the company has already begun trial production. The various prefabricated components it will produce to replace steel structures will also save a lot of steel.
    To save cement, the company has strengthened scientific research on the use of local, inexpensive materials, and some research results have already been applied to production.
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan—Some handicraft production cooperatives in Wuhan are using the method of utilizing old materials, waste materials, and substitutes to ensure production.
    Wuhan Beikou Production Cooperative encountered a complete shortage of raw materials in the second half of last year. The cooperative members used the accumulated undersized waste materials to make shell buttons. The shell buttons produced were relatively small and could not be sold in Wuhan, so the cooperative proactively contacted factories in Guangzhou that produced undershirts and found a market. By early January, the cooperative had already used more than 260,000 jin of waste materials, maintained production, and increased the cooperative's income by more than 55,000 yuan. The First Leather Goods Production Cooperative recently cleaned up the leather scraps that had accumulated in the cooperative for more than a year, clearing out more than 17,000 square feet of scattered leather, which can be used to make thousands of aviation-style leather suitcases, leather backpacks, leather wallets, and hundreds of dozens of embroidered leather belts, saving the cooperative a total of more than 19,000 yuan. Some cooperatives also use raw materials that they do not need to exchange with other cooperatives for raw materials that they need.
    In order to better utilize scraps and waste materials and ensure product quality, some cooperatives pay attention to strengthening education for their members, and some cooperatives also designate special personnel to study and trial-produce. An aviation-style semi-circular corner leather suitcase successfully trial-produced by the First Leather Goods Cooperative, although made up of twenty-seven pieces of scattered leather, uses relatively thick leather. The corners are reinforced with two layers, and there are two reinforcing strips at the joints, so the resulting suitcase is still beautiful and durable.

    合理地使用和积极节约原材料
    沈阳第三机床厂把多领到的钢材退还国家
    鞍山冶金建筑公司订出节约建筑材料计划
    武汉手工业社利用废料和代用品保证生产
    新华社沈阳19日电　沈阳第三机床厂监察室，坚持同本位主义思想斗争，使这个工厂把多领的钢材退回给国家。
    这个工厂去年剩余的“一K三六”车床主轴钢材，足够今年一年生产这种车床的主轴用。由于供应部门和生产部门缺乏联系，在准备今年第一季度材料的时候，又向国家要来二十一吨这种钢材。这个工厂的监察室在深入检查钢材使用情况的时候，发现了这个问题，便建议他们把多要的主轴钢材退给国家。这时，有一些主管人员认为，虽然这种主轴钢材多了，其他规格的钢材还不足，可以用这种主轴钢材来代替其他规格钢材，因此不准备退给国家。监察室经过研究，认为不少兄弟工厂缺少主轴钢材，要把多余的主轴钢材据为己有，代替其他规格的钢材，仍然是本位主义思想，于是又把这个问题反映给党总支和厂长。党总支书记和厂长积极支持监察室的意见，批判了某些人员的本位主义思想。现在这个工厂已经把多要的这种主轴钢材退回给国家。
    据新华社鞍山讯　鞍山冶金建筑总公司初步计划在今年节约一千七百吨钢材和一万三千吨水泥。
    这个公司去年节约了七百三十吨钢材和一万多吨水泥。最近公司在总结节约的经验以后，认为节约的潜力还很大。这主要是由于自去年下半年以来，职工们又找到许多新的节约门径。比如，劳动模范黄德茂和工长何云义等人最近制造的热轧机，可以利用废钢材轧制六公厘到九公厘的圆钢，一年能轧六千吨。过去用冷拉钢筋的办法，只能拉直径在十二公厘以下的圆钢，现在由于采取了一些技术措施，连直径十二到十九公厘的圆钢也可以冷拉。这样，每加工三千吨钢筋，就能节约两百吨以上。这个公司新建的一座预应力钢弦混凝土车间已经开始试生产，它将要生产的各种用来代替钢结构的预制构件，也能节约许多钢材。
    为了节约水泥，这个公司加强了利用当地廉价材料的科学研究工作，有些研究结果也已经能应用到生产上来了。
    据新华社武汉讯　武汉市部分手工业生产合作社用利用旧料、废料和代用品的办法来保证生产。
    武汉市贝扣生产合作社在去年下半年曾经遇到原材料完全缺乏的困难，社员们就用过去积存的不够尺寸的废料制作贝扣。制出的贝扣比较小，在武汉市销不出，社里就主动和广州市生产汗衫的工厂联系，找到了销路。到1月上旬，这个社已经利用了二十六万多斤废料，维持了生产，为合作社增加五万五千多元收入。第一皮件生产合作社最近把社里一年多以来堆积起来的皮渣子清理一次，共清理出零碎皮子一万七千多平方尺，可以做几千个航空式皮箱、皮背包、皮荷包和几百打穿花皮带，一共可为合作社节约资金一万九千多元。有些社还利用本社用不着的原料同别的社换取自己所需要的原料。
    为了更好的利用零料、废料，保证产品质量，有些社注意加强对社员的教育，有的社并且指定专人研究试制。第一皮件社试制成功的一种航空式半圆角皮箱，虽然是由二十七块零碎皮子拼凑成的，但是所用的皮子比较厚，转角处用了两层，结头处又安有两道筋，因此制出的箱子仍然美观耐用。
