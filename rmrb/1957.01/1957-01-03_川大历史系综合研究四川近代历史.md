    Sichuan University History Department Comprehensively Researches Modern History of Sichuan
    The History Department of Sichuan University is currently conducting a comprehensive study of the modern history of Sichuan.

    The research method combines documentary records with archival materials. All archives have been compiled into preliminary statistical tables according to their nature and age, and arranged on shelves. Among them, the sections on peasant uprisings, uprisings of ethnic minorities in the Southwest, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution, and the Boxer Movement have been compiled into special cases, all numbered and cataloged by year, month, and day, with summaries of each event. This batch of archives has been organized to the extent that it can be used at will in conjunction with scientific research work. In the future, it is planned to first print a detailed catalog of this part of the material, and then transcribe it all for publication as historical data or selected compilations.

    Currently, the central task of the "Comprehensive Research on Modern Sichuan History" is to compile the "Compilation of Historical Materials on Modern Sichuan Peasant Uprisings," the main contents of which are historical materials on the Li Yonghe and Lan Chaoding uprisings, Shi Dakai's battles in Sichuan, and the Boxer Movement in Sichuan, etc. More detailed logs are being made of the historical materials on the Li Yonghe and Lan Chaoding uprisings, and the compilation of historical materials is also underway. The "Compilation of Historical Materials on Modern Sichuan Peasant Uprisings" will be published by the Science Press after it is completed.

    In addition, the research topics that have been fully completed include "The Complete Story of the Dazu Church Case in Sichuan from 1886 to 1898" (published in the Social Science Edition of the Sichuan University Journal, 1956, Issue 1) and "The People of Dongxiang, Sichuan's Struggle Against Grain Taxes in 1875." The research topics planned for completion in 1957 include social and economic data on Sichuan on the eve of the Opium War and social and economic data on Sichuan during the Republic of China period.
