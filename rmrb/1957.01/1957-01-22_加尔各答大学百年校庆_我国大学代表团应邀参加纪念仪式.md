Xinhua News Agency, Calcutta, January 21st: The centenary celebration of Calcutta University was held on the afternoon of the 20th, presided over by the President of India, Prasad.

Tens of thousands of students, alumni, professors, and scholars participated in the ceremony. Chinese and other foreign university delegations also attended.

President Prasad, who once studied at Calcutta University, reviewed the history of the university in his opening remarks. He said that in the past, the trend of advocating English prevailed, and English as a teaching tool imposed a heavy burden on Indian education. Although India has produced some scholars and scientists using a foreign language as a teaching tool, their number is too small. He said that public opinion is in favor of Indianizing education, and the leaders of the English faction are now on the defensive. Moreover, due to the rise of the nation and the establishment of an independent republic, Indian languages will soon regain their original appearance. He hopes that Indian languages will have a great revival in the coming years.

Prasad hoped that universities would use more effort to improve teaching and enable future graduates to have the ability to take on various professions.

The Vice-Chancellor of Calcutta University, Governor Naidu of West Bengal, welcomed the foreign and Indian guests.

Wang Yanan, on behalf of the faculty and students of the fourteen Chinese universities who were invited, congratulated Calcutta University on its centenary. He said that Calcutta University is known to the world for its contributions to science and education. After independence, Calcutta University has made achievements in training Indian science and cultural construction talents. He hopes to work together with Calcutta University to promote brotherly friendship and closer contact and cooperation.

Calcutta University is one of the largest and oldest universities in India, consisting of one hundred and six colleges with tens of thousands of students.

The Chinese delegation, composed of six presidents, vice-presidents, and prominent professors from Chinese universities, arrived in Calcutta on January 16th at the invitation of Calcutta University. They attended the groundbreaking ceremony for the new campus of Calcutta University and presented gifts to Calcutta University.

    加尔各答大学百年校庆
    我国大学代表团应邀参加纪念仪式
    新华社加尔各答21日电　加尔各答大学创办百周年纪念仪式20日下午在印度总统普拉沙德主持下举行。
    成千上万的学生、校友、教授和学者们参加了这个仪式。中国的和其它外国的大学代表团也出席参加。
    曾经在加尔各答大学学习的普拉沙德总统在致开会辞时追述了大学的历史。他说，过去，崇尚英语的风气得势，作为教学工具的英语给印度的教育强加上了一个沉重的负担。虽然在用外国语作为教学工具的情况下，印度曾经产生了一些学者和科学家，但是他们的人数是太少了。他说，公众舆论是赞成教育印度化的，英语派的主将们现在居于守势，而且由于民族的兴起和独立的共和国的建立，印度的语言即将恢复它们的本来面貌。他希望在以后若干年中印度语言将会有巨大的复活。
    普拉沙德希望各大学以更多的力量改进教学，并且使将来毕业的学生具有担任各种职业的能力。
    加尔各答大学校长、西孟加拉邦邦长奈都对外国和印度的来宾表示欢迎。
    王亚南代表接受邀请的十四个中国大学的全体师生祝贺加尔各答大学创办一百周年。他说，加尔各答大学由于在科学和教育方面作出的贡献而闻名世界。在独立后，加尔各答大学在训练印度科学和文化建设人才方面取得了成就。他希望同加尔各答大学共同努力，以促进兄弟般的友谊和更紧密的接触和合作。
    加尔各答大学是印度最大和最古老的大学之一，它由一百零六个学院组成，有几万名学生。
    由中国大学的六个校长、副校长和著名教授组成的中国代表团，应加尔各答大学的邀请，1月16日到达加尔各答。他们参加了加尔各答大学新校舍奠基典礼，并且向加尔各答大学赠送了礼物。
