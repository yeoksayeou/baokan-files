Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 26th. The Sixth Session of the Vietnam National Assembly successfully concluded on the afternoon of the 25th, after nearly a month of work.

At the closing, more than two hundred and twenty National Assembly representatives enthusiastically cheered "Long live President Ho Chi Minh!" Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, they also shouted slogans: "Long live peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam!" "Vietnam will surely be unified!" before leaving the venue.

During the session, the National Assembly representatives reviewed the work of the government in various fields and passed various resolutions. The National Assembly agreed with the Vietnamese government's policies and guidelines in domestic and foreign affairs, both in the past and in the future.

President Ho Chi Minh delivered a speech at the closing ceremony, congratulating the great success of the meeting. Ho Chi Minh hoped that the achievements of this meeting could be widely disseminated, so that the people of the whole country would be more invigorated, more united, and jointly launch a competition to achieve the tasks of 1957, so as to make 1957 a year full of hope.

Before the National Assembly closed, the representatives elected a Constitution Amendment Sub-Committee composed of twenty-nine people, including Ho Chi Minh, Pham Van Dong, and Vo Nguyen Giap. Ho Chi Minh took office as the chairman of this committee.

After the election of the Constitution Amendment Sub-Committee, the assembly elected a new Standing Committee composed of fifteen members and three alternate members through a secret ballot. Ton Duc Thang and Ton Quang Phiet were re-elected as Chairman and Vice-Chairman, and Tran Van Tri as Secretary.

According to the decision of the new Standing Committee, the number of vice-chairmen will remain unchanged for the time being, pending the completion of the constitutional amendment and supplementary elections before increasing the number.

Amidst cheers, Ton Duc Thang, on behalf of the new Standing Committee, expressed gratitude for the trust of the National Assembly. In summarizing the work of the meeting, Ton Duc Thang pointed out that the success of the Sixth Session of the National Assembly has solved many fundamental issues related to people of all strata, making the Vietnamese people more confident in their own strength, more confident in the bright future of the nation, and more trusting in the Vietnam Workers' Party. He said that before the meeting of the Vietnam National Assembly, the imperialists had stepped up their activities, attempting to spread unease and sow discord among the people. The success of the meeting has shown them that their sabotage conspiracies have failed.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 26th. The Vietnam National Assembly unanimously adopted a statement on the 25th in response to the proposal of the Soviet Supreme Soviet on the issue of arms reduction. The statement said that the issue of arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs are issues that the people of the world urgently demand to be resolved. The National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam approves and warmly supports the appeal of the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting on July 16 last year. The National Assembly believes that major countries bear an important responsibility for safeguarding world peace and security, and they should take the lead on the issue of arms reduction.

On the 25th, the Vietnam National Assembly also passed letters to the Vietnamese people at home and abroad, to the compatriots in South Vietnam, and to the People's Army.

In a letter to the people at home and abroad, the National Assembly stated that it believes that the Party and the government's line is fundamentally correct, that achievements are the main aspect, and that errors and shortcomings are partial and temporary. The National Assembly unanimously expressed its full confidence in the government led by President Ho Chi Minh. We still need to develop the great achievements in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution, strive to build the North, continuously develop the people's democratic system, and gradually enter socialism. All patriots should actively increase production, practice thrift, promote the spirit of self-reliance, and be vigilant against the enemy.

In a letter to the compatriots in South Vietnam, it stated that the enemies of our people are vicious, but as long as all the people of our country unite and fight, they will surely be able to smash all conspiracies to divide our motherland. The struggle to unify the motherland is a long and arduous revolutionary struggle, but it will surely be victorious. No force can stop the Vietnamese people's will to unify their motherland and their flesh-and-blood sentiments.

In a letter to the People's Army, it stated that American imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem regime are conspiring to prepare for war and undermine the unification of the motherland. Our army must actively study politics and strive to carry out tactical and technical training, gradually move towards regularization and modernization, and be ready to smash the enemy's invasion conspiracies and defend the fruits of the revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 25th. The Vietnam National Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution this morning, firmly supporting the Hungarian people's struggle to defend their socialist achievements, and supporting the just struggles of the people of Egypt and Algeria.
