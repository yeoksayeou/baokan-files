Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 12th: The head of the Jordanian government delegation participating in aid negotiations in Cairo, Jordanian Minister of Education Irshidat, said on the evening of the 10th: "Jordan has not requested, nor has it received any economic aid from the United States. Jordan believes that the defense of this region should be undertaken by the Arab countries themselves." He pointed out: "We reject any unilateral policy aimed at using force to resolve Middle East problems, because we believe that (Jordan) should maintain neutrality between East and West."

The Jordanian government delegation arrived in Cairo on the 10th. The delegation members include Finance Minister Toukan, Minister of State Rimawi, and Army Chief of Staff Brigadier General Nowar. This delegation will discuss with Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia the issue of financial aid from these three countries to Jordan, which will replace the approximately 12 million pounds sterling in subsidies that the United Kingdom provides to Jordan annually.

Irshidat said that his mission is to determine the form of financial assistance provided by Arab countries to replace British subsidies, and to discuss with Egyptian leaders ways to eradicate the final vestiges of foreign imperialism. He pointed out: "Once an agreement is reached on this point, Jordan will be able to abolish the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty forever." He said that this agreement would not only curb British influence in Jordan, but also curb British influence in all other Arab countries.

Speaking about Eisenhower's Middle East plan on the 11th, delegation member Rimawi also pointed out that Jordan has not requested any economic or non-economic assistance from the United States. He cited the reasons for Jordan's opposition to the Eisenhower Plan as follows: First, the Eisenhower Plan violates Jordan's position that the Arab world should rely on its own resources and break away from national blocs; second, the only qualified authority to resolve international disputes is the United Nations, not any major power; third, Arab countries should not be involved in treaties with foreign countries, but should adhere to neutrality and not accept any conditional foreign aid.

Speaking of the so-called communist threat to the Middle East, Rimawi said that the reason why Western propaganda agencies have been making so much noise in this regard is to suppress the Arab national liberation movement under the pretext of "preventing communist expansion" and to conceal America's intentions of aggression.

In his speech, Rimawi also refuted the "power vacuum" argument put forward by the United States. He said that Jordan will adopt a consistent policy with Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia regarding the Eisenhower Doctrine.

Regarding the issue of Israel's further withdrawal from Egyptian territory, Rimawi said that whether or not the UN resolution requiring troop withdrawal is implemented is a touchstone of whether the international organization enjoys prestige, and also a test of whether all UN member states, especially the United States, are faithful to the principles of the United Nations.

    约旦反对用武力解决中东问题
    没有要求美国援助，愿在东西方之间守中立
    西方借口“防共”以掩盖美国侵略中东意图
    新华社开罗12日电　在开罗参加援助谈判的约旦政府代表团团长、约旦教育大臣伊尔舍达特10日晚上说：“约旦没有要求、也没有得到美国给予的任何经济援助。约旦认为这个地区的防务应当由阿拉伯国家自己担当起来。”他指出：“我们拒绝目的在使用武力解决中东问题的任何片面政策，因为我们相信（约旦）应当在东西方之间保持中立。”
    约旦政府代表团是在10日到达开罗的。代表团的团员包括财政大臣图康、国务大臣里马维和陆军参谋长诺瓦尔准将。这个代表团将同埃及、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯会谈这三个国家给约旦财政援助的问题，这项援助将代替英国每年给予约旦的约一千二百万英镑的津贴。
    伊尔舍达特说，他的使命是决定阿拉伯国家给予代替英国津贴的财政援助的形式，并且将同埃及领袖们商谈根除外国帝国主义的最后痕迹的办法。他指出：“一旦就这一点达成协议，约旦就能够永远废除英约条约。”他说，这项协议不仅能遏止英国在约旦的势力，还能遏止英国在所有其他阿拉伯国家的势力。
    代表团团员里马维11日在谈到艾森豪威尔的中东计划时也指出，约旦不曾向美国要求任何经济的或非经济的援助。他举出约旦反对艾森豪威尔计划的理由是：第一，艾森豪威尔计划违反了约旦的主张，约旦主张阿拉伯世界应该依靠它自己的资源，摆脱国家集团；第二，解决国际纠纷唯一有资格的权威机构是联合国，而不是任何大国；第三，阿拉伯国家不应该牵连到同外国的条约中，而应该坚持中立，不接受任何有条件的外援。
    在谈到对中东的所谓共产主义威胁的时候，里马维说，西方宣传机构在这方面所以大肆渲染，目的是要在“防止共产主义扩张”的借口下镇压阿拉伯的民族解放运动，并且掩盖美国的侵略意图。
    里马维在谈话中还驳斥了美国所提出的“势力真空”的论调。他说，对于艾森豪威尔主义，约旦将同埃及、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯采取一致的政策。
    对于以色列进一步撤出埃及领土的问题，里马维说，是否执行联合国的要求撤兵的决议，是这个国际组织是否享有威信的试金石，也是考验全体联合国成员国、尤其是美国，是否忠于联合国原则的试金石。
