　　These days, all the people of China have been watching with great excitement the friendly visit to the Soviet Union by the Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai and the friendly talks between the Chinese and Soviet government delegations. The Chinese and Soviet government delegations issued a joint statement on the 18th. This historic document shows that both sides have completely identical views on important issues in the international situation, on further strengthening the friendly and cooperative relations between socialist countries, and on further developing friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. The Chinese people are very satisfied to see that the Sino-Soviet talks have further strengthened the unity of the socialist countries and the unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union, and have made new and significant contributions to the cause of socialism and world peace.

　　This Sino-Soviet summit was held at an important moment in the international situation. Although the imperialist aggression against Egypt and the adventure in Hungary have failed, they are not reconciled. The United States has announced that it will use the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to replace the Anglo-French colonialism that failed in the aggression, and to invade and enslave the countries of the Middle East. At the same time, imperialism has not relaxed its conspiracy to undermine socialist countries in the slightest. Therefore, it is necessary for the people of all socialist countries and all peace-loving people to continue to maintain vigilance and work together to wage a resolute struggle to safeguard peace and shatter all aggressive conspiracies of imperialism.

　　During the talks, the representatives of China and the Soviet Union extensively exchanged views on the current international situation and important international issues, and reached completely unanimous views. The two governments jointly condemned the US aggressive policy toward the Middle East and are prepared to continue to provide the people of the Middle East with necessary support. The two governments believe that the demand put forward by Egypt for the aggressors to compensate for all losses must be met, and resolutely oppose any conspiracy by the imperialists to implement "international control" over the Suez Canal. The two governments support the struggles of the people of all countries against colonialism and in defense of national independence and freedom, and advocate that socialist countries and nationally independent countries can cooperate in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence to oppose war and colonialism and defend world peace. The two governments believe that the victory of the Hungarian people's struggle is the victory of peace and socialism; the Soviet Union's assistance to the Hungarian people in defeating the counter-revolutionary restoration conspiracy is not only fulfilling its internationalist obligations to Hungary and other socialist countries, but also extremely necessary for maintaining world peace. The two governments reaffirmed that the realization of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems is the unshakable foundation of the two governments' foreign policy; condemned the US policy of hostility towards the People's Republic of China; welcomed the restoration of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, and believed that further promoting the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations should be put on the agenda; and reiterated their support for the struggles of the German people, the Korean people, and the Vietnamese people to strive for the reunification of their motherlands. In order to maintain peace and the security of the people of all countries, the two governments believe that all exclusive military blocs should be replaced by a collective peace and collective security system. In view of the paramount importance of reaching an agreement on disarmament among the major powers to the current international situation, China and the Soviet Union will do everything possible to reach an agreement on the disarmament issue. The two governments also pointed out that the forces of peace far outweigh the forces of aggression. As long as all forces that can be united internationally are united and work together to persevere in the struggle, any conspiracy of the imperialist aggression group will surely be defeated. The consistent views and clear attitude of the Chinese and Soviet governments on important issues in the current international situation will greatly strengthen the confidence of the people of all countries in the struggle against imperialist aggressive forces and become a powerful factor in promoting the cause of world peace.

　　This meeting is of great significance to the cause of strengthening the unity of socialist countries. At present, the imperialist group headed by the United States is stepping up its sabotage and subversion activities against socialist countries. They also use chauvinism, narrow national sentiments and the remnants of certain national estrangements to provoke and undermine the unity of socialist countries. Under such circumstances, as the joint statement pointed out: further strengthening the unity and cooperation between socialist countries is of particularly important significance. Faced with the enemy's frenzied offensive, the people of all socialist countries are required to maintain the unity of socialist countries with a high degree of proletarian internationalism and a firm stand. The unity of socialist countries is the most important guarantee for the cause of socialism and also the most important guarantee for the cause of world peace. Only by strengthening the unity of socialist countries can we defeat the frenzied offensive of imperialism and ensure the smooth development of the cause of socialism and the cause of world peace. It is encouraging that the great unity of socialist countries is constantly being strengthened and consolidated. Recently, according to the spirit of the Soviet government's declaration on the basis of developing and further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in October last year, socialist countries have signed many bilateral and multilateral agreements through comradely consultations, smoothly resolved problems within the socialist camp, and further strengthened the unity and mutual relations between socialist countries, further strengthening the struggle of the people of socialist countries against aggressive forces. Imperialism has tried its best to alienate other socialist countries from the unity of the Soviet Union, the center of the socialist camp, but just as mayflies cannot shake a big tree, their conspiracy has failed and will continue to fail.

　　The friendly unity between China and the Soviet Union is one of the most important factors in the great unity of socialist countries and an important pillar of world peace. The unity between China and the Soviet Union has undergone severe tests, because this unity is not only based on the common ideology of Marxism-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism, but has also been fixed through the great Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. As Chairman Mao Zedong said long ago: "The unity of the people of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, will be permanent, indestructible, and no one can separate it. And this unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of China and the Soviet Union, but will also inevitably affect the future of mankind and affect the victory of world peace and justice." Like the people of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people deeply understand the important significance of the unity between China and the Soviet Union. We have always believed that continuing to consolidate and strengthen the unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union is in the fundamental interests of our two peoples, and we regard constantly strengthening unity with the great Soviet Union as our highest internationalist obligation. Imperialism is particularly afraid of the unity of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, which have 800 million people, so they have been sparing no effort to undermine and alienate this unity. However, our 800 million people are forever united together, and any conspiracy of imperialism is doomed to failure.

　　This meeting has created new conditions for the further development of friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. The joint statement stipulates: "In the future, China and the Soviet Union will further develop mutual assistance and cooperation between the two countries in the political, economic, and cultural fields." Over the past few years, the brotherly friendship and mutual cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union have continued to develop and become increasingly consolidated. Under the great banner of proletarian internationalism, in the struggle to defend world peace and the cause of socialism and to strive for common economic upsurge, the people of China and the Soviet Union have always been united and supported each other. Our people will always be grateful to the Soviet Union for the brotherly, generous and selfless assistance it has given to our country in socialist construction. At the same time, the Chinese people have always believed that the victory of our revolution and today's achievements are inseparable from taking the road of the October Revolution. The basic experience of the Soviet revolution and construction is a great example for our revolution and construction. Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union humbly and conscientiously with correct methods and applying it to our socialist construction in combination with our country's specific conditions, as in the past, remains an important task for our people.

　　The Sino-Soviet talks have attracted widespread attention throughout the world. The joint statement of the two countries, which shows that the Sino-Soviet talks have achieved complete success, is a great encouragement to the people of all socialist countries and all people who love peace and freedom, and it is another inevitable and heavy blow to the imperialists!

    八亿人民永远在一起
    这些天来，全中国人民怀着十分兴奋的心情，一直注视着以周恩来总理为首的我国政府代表团在苏联的友好访问和中苏两国政府代表团的友好会谈。中苏两国政府代表团18日发表了联合声明，这个历史性文件表明：在国际形势中的重要问题上，在进一步加强社会主义国家友好合作关系问题和进一步发展中苏两国的友好合作问题上，双方观点是完全一致的。中国人民十分满意地看到，中苏会谈已经进一步加强了社会主义国家的团结和中苏两国人民的团结，对社会主义事业和世界和平事业作出了新的重大的贡献。
    这次中苏会谈是在国际局势的重要时刻举行的。目前帝国主义在埃及的侵略和在匈牙利的冒险虽然已经失败，但是他们并不甘心。美国已经宣布要以“艾森豪威尔主义”来代替在侵略中失败了的英法殖民主义，侵略和奴役中近东各国。同时，帝国主义也没有丝毫放松破坏社会主义国家的阴谋活动。因此，就需要社会主义各国人民和一切爱好和平的人民继续提高警惕，共同努力，为维护和平、粉碎帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋而进行坚决的斗争。
    中苏两国代表在会谈中，对目前国际局势和重要的国际问题广泛地交换了意见，并取得了完全一致的看法。两国政府一致谴责美国对中近东各国的侵略政策，并准备继续给予中近东各国人民以必要的支持。两国政府认为必须满足埃及提出的由侵略者赔偿全部损失的要求，坚决反对帝国主义者对苏伊士运河实行“国际管制”的任何阴谋。两国政府支持各国人民反对殖民主义、捍卫民族独立和自由的斗争，主张社会主义国家和民族独立国家可以按照和平共处的五项原则进行合作，以反对战争和殖民主义，保卫世界和平。两国政府认为，匈牙利人民斗争的胜利是和平和社会主义事业的胜利；苏联援助匈牙利人民击败反革命复辟阴谋，不仅是对匈牙利和其他社会主义国家尽了国际主义的义务，而且对于维护世界和平极为必要。两国政府重申实现不同社会制度国家之间的和平共处是两国政府对外政策不可动摇的基础；谴责美国敌视中华人民共和国的政策；欢迎苏日恢复外交关系，认为进一步促进中日关系正常化应提上议事日程；重申支持德国人民、朝鲜人民和越南人民争取祖国统一的斗争。为了维护和平和各国人民的安全，两国政府认为，一切排他性军事集团应当为集体和平和集体安全体系所代替。鉴于大国就裁军问题达成协议对当前国际局势具有头等重要意义，中苏两国将尽一切可能使裁军问题达成协议。两国政府并且指出，目前和平力量远远超过侵略力量，只要把国际上一切可以团结的力量团结起来，共同努力，坚持斗争，帝国主义侵略集团的任何阴谋都是一定能够击破的。中苏两国政府对目前国际局势中的重要问题的一致见解和明确态度，必将大大加强各国人民对帝国主义侵略势力斗争的信心，成为推进世界和平事业的有力因素。
    这次会谈对加强社会主义国家的团结的事业具有重要的意义。目前以美国为首的帝国主义集团正在加紧对社会主义国家的破坏和颠覆活动。它们并利用沙文主义、狭隘的民族感情和某些民族隔阂的残余来挑拨和破坏社会主义国家的团结。在这种情况下，正如联合声明所指出的：进一步加强社会主义国家之间的团结合作具有特别重要的意义。面对着敌人疯狂的进攻，要求社会主义各国人民以高度的无产阶级国际主义精神和坚定的立场，来维护社会主义国家的团结。社会主义国家的团结，是社会主义事业的最重要的保证，也是世界和平事业的最重要的保证。只有加强社会主义国家的团结，才能击败帝国主义的疯狂进攻，才能确保社会主义事业和世界和平事业的顺利发展。令人鼓舞的是社会主义国家的伟大团结正在不断地加强和巩固中。最近以来，社会主义各国根据去年10月苏联政府关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言的精神，经过同志式的协商，签订了许多双边和多边协定，顺利地解决了社会主义阵营内部的问题，进一步加强了社会主义各国的团结和相互关系，进一步加强了社会主义各国人民反对侵略势力的斗争。帝国主义千方百计地企图离间其他社会主义各国同社会主义阵营的中心苏联的团结，但是，这正像蜉蝣不能撼动大树一样，他们的阴谋失败了，而且必将继续遭受失败。
    中国和苏联的友好团结是社会主义国家伟大团结的一个最重要的因素，是世界和平的重要支柱。中苏两国的团结已经经历了严重的考验，因为这种团结不仅建立在马克思列宁主义的共同思想的基础上和无产阶级国际主义的原则上，而且已经通过伟大的中苏友好同盟互助条约而固定下来。正如毛泽东主席早已说过的：“中苏两大国人民的团结将是永久的，不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的。而这种团结，不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。”中国人民和苏联人民一样，深切地了解中苏两国团结的重要意义。我们一向认为继续巩固和加强中苏两国人民的团结是符合我们两国人民的根本利益的，而且把不断加强同伟大苏联的团结看成是自己国际主义的最高义务。帝国主义特别害怕拥有八万万人口的中苏两大国的团结，因此，他们一直在不遗余力地企图破坏和离间这种团结。但是，我们八亿人民永远团结在一起，帝国主义的任何阴谋都注定要失败。
    这次会谈为中苏两国的友好合作关系的更加发展创造了新的条件。联合声明中规定：“中苏两国今后将进一步发展两国在政治、经济、文化各方面的互助合作关系。”几年来，中苏两国人民的兄弟友谊和互助合作关系不断发展，日益巩固。在无产阶级国际主义的伟大旗帜下，在保卫世界和平和社会主义事业、争取共同经济高涨的斗争中，中苏两国人民一向团结一致，互相支援。我国人民永远感激苏联在我国社会主义建设中给予我国的兄弟般的慷慨无私的援助。同时，中国人民一向认为，我们革命的胜利和今天的成就是同走十月革命的道路分不开的。苏联革命和建设的基本经验是我国革命和建设的伟大榜样。虚心地认真地用正确的方法学习苏联的先进经验，结合我国的具体条件在我国的社会主义建设事业中加以运用，在今后同在过去一样，仍然是我国人民的重要的任务。
    中苏会谈引起了全世界的广泛的注意。表明中苏会谈取得圆满结果的两国联合声明，对于社会主义各国人民和一切爱好和平和自由的人民，是一个伟大的鼓舞，而对于帝国主义者，则是又一次不可避免的、沉重的打击！
