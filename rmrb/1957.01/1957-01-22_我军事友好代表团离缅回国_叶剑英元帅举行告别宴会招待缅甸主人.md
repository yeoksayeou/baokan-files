Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, January 21st: The Chinese Military Friendship Delegation, headed by Marshal Ye Jianying, left Rangoon by special plane this morning to return home after a three-week visit to the Union of Burma.

Those who saw the delegation off at the airport included General Ne Win, Chief of Staff of the Burmese Defense Forces, and Deputy Chief of Staff (Air Force) Clift, Chinese Ambassador to Burma Yao Zhongming, Burmese Ambassador to China Wu La Mao, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Burma.

On the evening of January 20th, Marshal Ye Jianying held a farewell banquet at the Chinese Embassy in Burma to entertain the Burmese hosts and thank them for the warm reception given to the delegation during its visit.

Among those present at the banquet were Burmese Deputy Prime Minister Tekin Ting, General Ne Win, Acting Chief Justice of the Federal Supreme Court Wu Min Deng, Clift, and other senior military and government officials and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Burma.

In his speech at the banquet, Marshal Ye Jianying said, "We are very pleased to see that the friendship between China and Burma not only exists between the leaders of our two countries and between our two governments, but also that a deep friendship is rooted in the people of our two countries and in the armies of both countries."

After pointing out that the armies of China and Burma have many similarities, Marshal Ye Jianying said, "These similarities give us practical significance and broad prospects in mutual learning and in developing friendly cooperation."

He pointed out: To be friendly and peacefully coexist with any country in the world on the basis of the Five Principles is the lofty aspiration of the Chinese people, and also of the Chinese soldiers. "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is an army that loves peace and is loyal to the socialist motherland. It will never invade others, and it will never allow others to invade its own motherland."

Marshal Ye Jianying finally hoped that the friendship between the people and armies of China and Burma would flow like the Irrawaddy River.

General Ne Win said at the banquet, "China and Burma have a common belief, that is, when any problem arises, we will not solve it by force, violence, or military power, but through negotiation, through fair and reasonable ways that satisfy both parties. This is our firm belief."

General Ne Win said, "The army of the People's Republic of China has ample strength, and this strength contributes to world peace." Ne Win stated that delegations or individuals from the Chinese army are welcome to visit Burma at any time, and we are always prepared to welcome them.

At the end of the banquet, Marshal Ye Jianying presented military flags, military emblems, etc., to the Burmese Ministry of National Defense, the Burmese Army, Navy, Air Force, and other relevant military departments. General Ne Win accepted the gifts amidst warm applause.
