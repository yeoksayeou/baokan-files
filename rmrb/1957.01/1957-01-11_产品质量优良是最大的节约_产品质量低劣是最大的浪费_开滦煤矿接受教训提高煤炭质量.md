Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, January 10th: Since the Kailuan Coal Mine began to correct its practice of neglecting quality in May 1956, the quality of coal has significantly improved. As of January 8 this year, users such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have successively written to express their satisfaction with the coal supplied by the Kailuan Coal Mine.

In the past, due to a one-sided pursuit of output and neglect of quality, the Kailuan Coal Mine was frequently criticized and fined by users. From January 1955 to April 1956, more than 340,000 tons of stones were found in the coal supplied to users, resulting in fines of more than 420,000 yuan. The coal supplied to the joint state-private Qixin Cement Plant contained excessive stones and had low calorific value, which not only increased coal consumption but also frequently failed to meet the quality requirements for cement clinker, forcing the factory to lower the quality grade of cement. In the first quarter of 1956 alone, this caused the factory a loss of more than 44,000 yuan.

These serious lessons have made the leadership of the Kailuan Coal Mine realize that increasing production only on the premise of ensuring coal quality is the greatest saving. In order to improve coal quality, the coal mine organized coal quality inspection teams to go deep into various mining areas to specifically study coal seam structures with workers. Advanced mining methods such as separate mining and transportation and temporary roofing were promoted in coal seams with interbedded stones and broken roofs. A coal quality inspection network was also established among employees to supervise each other. After this, the amount of stone in the coal was greatly reduced, and the ash content of the coal generally decreased. In the second half of 1956, the average ash content per hundred tons of coal decreased by 1.16% compared with the first half of the year, and by 0.33% compared with the national target. As of January 7 this year, the ash content of the coal has decreased by another 0.14% compared to last year.

### 产品质量优良是最大的节约　产品质量低劣是最大的浪费  开滦煤矿接受教训提高煤炭质量

    产品质量优良是最大的节约　产品质量低劣是最大的浪费
    开滦煤矿接受教训提高煤炭质量
    新华社唐山10日电　开滦煤矿从1956年5月开始纠正忽视质量的做法以后，煤的质量显著提高。到今年1月8日止，鞍山钢铁公司、石景山钢铁厂等用户，先后来信对开滦煤矿供给的煤表示满意。
    开滦煤矿过去由于片面追求产量，忽视质量，经常受到用户的批评和罚款。从1955年1月到1956年4月供给用户的煤中，就有三十四万多吨石头，被用户罚款四十二万多元。供给公私合营启新水泥厂的煤，石头多，发热量低，不仅多烧了煤，水泥熟料还经常达不到质量要求，不得不降低水泥的质量标号。只1956年第一季度就使这个工厂损失四万四千多元。
    这些严重的教训使开滦煤矿领导方面认识到只有在保证煤的质量前提下增加产量才是最大的节约。为了提高煤的质量，这个煤矿组织了煤质检查组深入各采煤区同工人具体研究煤层构造，在有夹石和顶板破碎的煤层中推行了分采分运、托伪顶等先进采煤方法，并且在职工群众中建立了煤质检查网，互相监督。这样以后，煤里含的石头大大减少，煤的灰分普遍下降。1956年下半年每百吨煤的灰分平均比上半年降低了1.16％，比国家指标降低了0.33％。到今年1月7日，煤的灰分比去年又降低了0.14％。
