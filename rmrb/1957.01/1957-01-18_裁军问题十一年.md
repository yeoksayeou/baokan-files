The United Nations has been dealing with the disarmament issue for eleven years. Since the first session of the United Nations General Assembly adopted the resolution on "Principles Governing the General Regulation and Reduction of Armaments" in December 1946, based on a proposal by the Soviet Union, and established the Disarmament Commission under the Security Council in 1952, every session of the United Nations General Assembly has discussed the disarmament issue. Since 1954, to facilitate agreement among major powers on specific disarmament plans, a subcommittee was established under the United Nations Disarmament Commission. The subcommittee has also held numerous meetings and reviewed many proposals. However, due to obstruction by Western countries, the disarmament issue remains unresolved and there is no encouraging progress.

What exactly is the reason why the disarmament issue has been delayed for eleven years without a solution?

It is remembered that the proposal for general disarmament was first put forward by the Soviet representative at the United Nations General Assembly in October 1946. In addition to mentioning the general purpose of consolidating international peace and security, the Soviet proposal specifically pointed out that general disarmament would alleviate the significant economic burden on all countries caused by massive military expenditures, and emphasized that the primary task of implementing disarmament should be to prohibit the use of atomic energy for military purposes. For eleven years, the Soviet Union has put forward numerous flexible disarmament proposals, tirelessly striving for the goal it put forward at the first session of the United Nations General Assembly.

However, Western countries have employed various tactics of evasion, delay, and obstruction to hinder the achievement of a disarmament agreement.

They first insisted on the so-called "security before disarmament" argument, stubbornly claiming that absolute security guarantees must be in place before disarmament can begin. From the outset, they deliberately entangled the discussion of disarmament issues in endless debates over so-called "effective supervision," while striving to talk less or not at all about specific steps to implement disarmament, advocating a type of supervision that was, in fact, "supervision without disarmament."

Sometimes they also put forward very cumbersome plans that contained extremely sinister purposes. For example, the so-called phased disclosure and verification of armed forces, armaments, and atomic armaments plan, which the United States has repeatedly proposed and which has been supported by Britain and France, is actually a plan to gather military intelligence on the Soviet Union and other countries. The purpose is to first find out the number and deployment of troops, the production and storage of armaments, and even the economic resources and industrial production of the entire country in the Soviet Union and other countries. As for the start of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, they are postponed to the infinitely distant future, while setting up many obstacles in advance.

Since the Third United Nations General Assembly in 1948, the Soviet Union has repeatedly proposed that the five major powers first reduce their troops and armaments by one-third within a year, and at the same time, the five major powers conclude a treaty to strengthen peace. This proposal tore down the false mask of "security before disarmament" that Western countries wore in front of the people of the world. If they truly wanted security guarantees before disarming, why didn't they accept the proposal for the five major powers to conclude a peace treaty?

After this hypocritical mask of Western countries was torn off, what remained was the naked "position of strength policy" or so-called "deterrence policy." However, the international tensions and the frantic arms race caused by this policy have been met with increasing opposition from peace-loving people around the world. At the same time, the military adventure of the United States and its followers in Korea ended in failure, and countries such as Britain and France also began to feel the significant pressure of the arms race on their finances and economies.

To alleviate world public opinion's dissatisfaction with Western countries' obstruction of disarmament, British and French representatives presented a plan at the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee in June 1954, advocating a two-stage reduction of armaments and prohibition of atomic weapons. Although this plan had significant shortcomings and loopholes, such as delaying the complete prohibition of atomic weapons until the end of the second stage and retaining the so-called use of atomic weapons for "defensive" purposes, it was some progress compared to Western countries' previous plans that only sought to gather intelligence and did not discuss disarmament. Therefore, to reach an agreement as soon as possible on the disarmament issue that all countries' people are most concerned about, the Soviet government submitted a proposal to the ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 1954, advocating that countries, based on the British-French proposal, reduce their armaments, armed forces, and military appropriations by 50% of the agreed reduction quota within six months or one year, and then reduce the remaining 50% within another six months or one year, while completely prohibiting atomic weapons.

On May 10, 1955, the Soviet government further submitted to the Disarmament Subcommittee a proposal on reducing armaments, prohibiting atomic weapons, and eliminating the threat of a new war. This proposal removed the excuse that Western countries had always used to oppose reaching a concrete agreement on the disarmament issue.

Western countries have always insisted that the Soviet armed forces are larger than theirs, and therefore oppose countries simultaneously reducing their armed forces by one-third or other similar proportions. The Soviet proposal this time stipulates that the armed forces of the five major powers be reduced to a level not exceeding the following: the United States, the Soviet Union, and China each with one million to one million five hundred thousand, and Britain and France each with six hundred and fifty thousand. These limits were previously proposed by Western countries.

Western countries have always strongly opposed the prohibition of atomic weapons, using the need to maintain "balance of power" as a reason. The Soviet proposal this time adopted the method of reducing armed forces and prohibiting atomic weapons in two stages, as proposed in the British-French plan, but only added two points: first, countries possessing atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons should stop testing such weapons; second, before completely destroying atomic weapons, guarantee that atomic weapons will not be used except for defense against aggression with the consent of the Security Council.

Western countries have always accused the Soviet Union's disarmament proposals of lacking guarantees regarding supervision. The Soviet proposal this time put forward a practical and concrete method for international supervision and gave the international supervisory body full executive power. It advocated that, to prevent one country from suddenly attacking another country, the international supervisory body should establish monitoring posts in major ports, railway hubs, highways, and airports in all relevant countries based on mutual principles, so as to prevent the dangerous concentration of naval, land, and air forces.

This effort by the Soviet Union should have greatly narrowed the distance between everyone on the disarmament issue. The people of all countries were full of hope that a concrete agreement on the disarmament issue could be reached quickly and implemented. However, in the face of this very sincere attitude of the Soviet Union, Western countries retreated, suddenly returning to the position they had taken eleven years earlier when the United Nations began dealing with the disarmament issue. At the Disarmament Subcommittee, at the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference, and at the Tenth United Nations General Assembly, representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and other countries once again refused to talk about the specific issues of disarmament, and only insisted on prioritizing the discussion of the "Open Skies" plan put forward by Eisenhower at the Geneva Four Heads of State Conference (first, the United States and the Soviet Union would exchange all intelligence on the deployment of military forces within their countries and conduct aerial photography of each other), and forced the United Nations General Assembly to pass a resolution instructing the Disarmament Subcommittee to give priority to considering Eisenhower's plan. Everyone knows that the United States' so-called "Open Skies" plan is a very blatant plan to gather military intelligence. Implementing such a plan can only stimulate further arms races and is of no benefit to promoting disarmament.

Even so, the Soviet Union did not completely reject the United States' so-called "Open Skies" plan, but believed that this plan should be considered as part of comprehensive disarmament.

In view of the fact that Western countries have opposed the prohibition of atomic weapons for many years and have used this to reject the Soviet Union's comprehensive disarmament plans, the Soviet Union put forward a new proposal at the Disarmament Subcommittee meeting in March 1956, advocating that an international agreement should first be concluded on the issue of reducing conventional armaments and armed forces as the starting point for implementing disarmament. However, the Soviet proposal was still not accepted by Western countries. They withdrew their original proposals regarding the level of armed forces, demanding that the highest level of armed forces in the United States, the Soviet Union, and China be increased from 1.5 million to 2.5 million, and the highest level of armed forces in Britain and France be increased from 650,000 to 750,000; at the same time, they linked the solution of the disarmament issue to the prior solution of other political issues, primarily the German issue. This once again exposed that Western countries fundamentally do not want any progress on the disarmament issue. Their purpose is to try to widen the distance with the Soviet Union, not to narrow this distance. They are trying to avoid reaching an agreement rather than striving to reach an agreement.

In contrast to the Western countries' poor attitude of talking about disarmament in vain, the Soviet Union, while striving to reach a disarmament agreement, began to take practical actions to reduce its military forces. In 1955, the Soviet Union reduced its military forces by 640,000. On May 14, 1956, the Soviet government announced that it would reduce its armed forces by 1.2 million within a year ending May 1, 1957, and correspondingly reduce armaments and military expenditures. This fully proves the Soviet Union's sincerity in disarmament.

At the meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Commission in July 1956, the Soviet Union once again made concessions to Western countries, agreeing to the figures proposed by the United States in the subcommittee in March of last year regarding the level of armed forces of the five major powers, as the figures for the first step of disarmament. Thus, what remains is only the "Open Skies" plan, which is not relevant to disarmament itself. To reach an agreement on the disarmament issue as soon as possible, the Soviet Union, in its statement on disarmament and easing international tensions issued on November 17, 1956, again expressed its willingness to consider this issue, namely, to implement aerial photography in the European region (within 800 kilometers on both sides of the dividing line) where the main armed forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact member states are stationed.

The response to all these sincere efforts of the Soviet government was the cold attitude of the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France in their letter to Chairman Bulganin at the beginning of this year. They rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a meeting of the heads of government of the five countries to discuss the disarmament issue.

The facts of the past eleven years show that the negotiations on the disarmament issue, which the people of all countries are concerned about, have not yet achieved any concrete agreement, and the responsibility lies entirely with the Western countries, mainly with the United States. The ruling group in the United States, regardless of the continuous failures of the "policy of strength," is wholeheartedly trying to rely on the so-called "deterrence force" to dominate the world, and therefore is unwilling to reduce armaments, nor is it willing to prohibit atomic weapons. Of course, under the pressure of the people and public opinion of all countries, they have to talk about disarmament in words, but in reality, they are implementing a policy of expanding armaments. Recently, the President of the United States, in his "State of the Union Address," continued to openly advocate the "policy of strength," and the next year's budget of the United States increased military spending to a huge amount of 45.3 billion US dollars. The fact is very clear that the ruling group in the United States is trying to set off a new wave of expanding armaments.

However, the desire of the people of all countries to consolidate peace and achieve disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons is becoming increasingly irresistible. The peace-loving forces of the whole world stopped the armed aggression of Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt, and the Soviet Union's new disarmament proposals also give people greater confidence in striving for peace. The people of all countries will continue to work hard to achieve a disarmament agreement. US President Eisenhower expressed his willingness to discuss the disarmament issue "within the framework of the United Nations" in his letter to Bulganin. Now that the Soviet representative has suggested at the meeting of the Political Committee of the General Assembly that a special session of the United Nations General Assembly be convened to discuss the disarmament issue, whether the United States and its partners will accept this suggestion will be a test of whether they are willing to seriously discuss the disarmament issue.

    裁军问题十一年
    梁纯夫
    联合国处理裁军问题已经有十一年了。自从1946年12月第一届联合国大会根据苏联的建议通过了“关于普遍调整和裁减军备的原则”的决议，并于1952年在安全理事会下建立了裁军委员会以来，联合国大会没有一届会议没有讨论过裁军问题。从1954年起，为了便于大国之间就裁军的具体方案取得协议，又在联合国裁军委员会下设立一个小组委员会。小组委员会也已经开过好多次会议，审议过不少的方案。但是，由于西方国家的阻挠，裁军问题至今仍然悬而未决，而且并没有什么使人宽慰的进展。
    裁军问题拖延了十一年始终未能获得解决，原因究竟何在呢？
    人们都记得，普遍裁军的建议是苏联代表在1946年10月的联合国大会上最先提出来的。苏联的建议除了提到为巩固国际和平和安全的一般目的外，还特别指出普遍裁军将使各国减轻因大量军备费用所造成的重大经济负担，强调实施裁军应以禁止使用原子能于军事目的为首要工作。十一年以来，苏联提出过许许多多有伸缩性的裁军建议，不屈不挠地为它在联合国大会第一届会议上所提出的目标而奋斗。
    但是西方国家却玩弄了种种逃避、拖延、阻挠的手法，来阻挠裁军协议的达成。
    他们首先坚持所谓“安全先于裁军”的论调，硬说必须先有安全的绝对保证，才能着手裁军。他们一开始就故意使裁军问题的讨论纠缠在所谓“有效的监督”的无休止的争论上，对于实施裁军的具体步骤，却竭力少谈或根本不谈，主张实行一种事实上是“没有裁军的监督”。
    有时候他们也提出一些非常繁琐的方案，而里面却包含着十分险恶的目的。例如美国曾多次提出而受到英法两国支持的所谓分阶段披露和核证武装部队及军备和原子军备的方案，实际上是一种要在苏联和其他国家收集军事情报的计划，目的就是要先弄清楚苏联和其他国家的军队数目和防地、军备的生产和储存，以至整个国家的经济资源和工业生产情况。至于裁军和禁止原子武器的开始实施，它们都推到无限远的将来，同时预先布设好许许多多障碍。
    从1948年第三届联合国大会以后，苏联曾屡次提出五大国首先在一年内裁减军队和军备三分之一，同时由五大国缔结加强和平的公约的建议。这个建议把西方国家所谓安全先于裁军的虚伪面幕在世界人民面前撕了下来。如果他们真正要有安全保证然后裁军，他们为什么不接受五大国缔结和平公约的建议呢？
    西方国家这个虚伪的面幕被撕去之后，剩下来的便是赤裸裸的“实力地位政策”或所谓“威慑政策”了。但是，这种政策所造成的国际紧张局势和各国的疯狂军备竞赛，受到了世界各国爱好和平的人民愈来愈大的反对。同时美国和它的追随者在朝鲜的军事冒险宣告失败，英法等国也开始感觉到军备竞赛对本国财政和经济的重大压力。
    为了缓和世界舆论对西方国家阻挠裁军的不满情绪，英法代表1954年6月在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会上提出了一个方案，主张分两个阶段进行裁减军备和禁止原子武器。这个方案虽然有很大的缺点和漏洞，例如把完全禁止原子武器拖到第二阶段的末尾，并且还保留所谓为“防御”的目的而使用原子武器，但是比较西方国家以前单纯为搜集情报而不谈裁军的方案来说，总算有了一些进步。因此，苏联政府为了使各国人民所最关心的裁军问题早日达成协议，1954年9月向联合国大会第九届会议提出一个建议，主张以英法建议为基础，各国于6个月或一年内把军备、武装部队和军事拨款削减一致同意的裁减定额的50％，以后6个月或一年内再削减其余50％，同时完全禁止原子武器。
    1955年5月10日，苏联政府又进一步向裁军小组委员会提出关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁的建议。这个建议解除了西方国家一向反对就裁军问题取得具体协议的借口。
    西方国家一向硬说苏联武装部队比它们多，因此反对各国同时裁减武装部队三分之一或其他类似的比例。苏联这次建议规定五大国的武装部队裁减到不超过下列水平：美国、苏联和中国各一百万人到一百五十万人，英国和法国各六十五万人。这样的限额是西方国家从前提出过的。
    西方国家一向以要保持“势力均衡”为理由，极力反对禁止原子武器。苏联这次建议采纳了英法方案中分两阶段裁减武装部队和禁止原子武器的办法，只补充了两点：第一、拥有原子武器和氢武器的国家停止试验这种武器；第二、完全销毁原子武器之前，保证除为对侵略进行防御而经安理会同意之外，不使用原子武器。
    西方国家一向诬蔑苏联的裁军建议缺乏关于监督的保证。苏联这次建议在国际监督方面提出了一种切实可行的具体办法，并赋予国际监督机构以充分的执行权。它主张为了防止一个国家突然进攻另一个国家，国际监督机构将根据互相的原则在所有有关国家的各大港口、铁路枢纽、公路线和飞机场建立监察所，以便不让海陆空军进行危险的集中。
    苏联所作的这种努力，本应当使大家在裁军问题上的距离大大地缩短了。各国人民满怀希望期待着裁军问题能够迅速达成具体协议和开始施实。但是，在苏联这种十分诚恳的态度面前，西方国家却向后倒退，一下子回到十一年以前联合国开始处理裁军问题时他们所采取的立场。在裁军小组委员会上，在四国外长日内瓦会议上以及在第十届联合国大会上，美、英、法等国代表又绝口不谈裁军的具体问题，只坚持优先讨论艾森豪威尔在四国首脑日内瓦会议上所提出的“空中摄影”计划（首先由美苏两国交换国内军力部署的全部情报和互相进行空中摄影），并迫使联合国大会通过决议，指示裁军小组委员会优先考虑艾森豪威尔的计划。大家知道，美国的所谓“空中摄影”计划，是一种十分露骨的搜集军事情报的计划，实行这样的计划只能刺激进一步的军备竞赛，对于促成裁军是毫无好处的。
    虽然如此，苏联并没有一口否定美国的所谓“空中摄影”计划，只是认为这个计划应该作为全面裁军的一部分来考虑。
    苏联因为有鉴于西方国家多年以来一直反对禁止原子武器，并以此来拒绝苏联历次提出的全面裁军方案，所以在1956年3月的裁军小组委员会会议上提出了一个新建议，主张先就裁减常规军备和武装部队问题缔结一项国际协定，作为实行裁军的起点。但是苏联的建议，仍然未为西方国家所接受。它们撤回了自己原来关于武装部队水平的主张。而要求把美、苏、中的武装部队最高水平从一百五十万人提高到二百五十万人，英法的武装部队最高水平从六十五万人提高到七十五万人；同时把解决裁军问题同预先解决其他政治问题、首先是德国问题联系在一起。这就再一次暴露了西方国家根本不愿意裁军问题获得任何进展。它们的目的是竭力扩大同苏联之间的距离，而不是缩短这种距离，它们是要竭力避免达成协议而不是争取达成协议。
    同西方国家的空谈裁军的恶劣态度相反，苏联一面争取达成裁军协议，一面开始采取裁减军队的实际行动。1955年苏联就裁减了军队六十四万人。1956年5月14日，苏联政府又宣布到1957年5月1日为止的一年内裁减武装部队一百二十万人，并相应削减军备和军事开支。这充分证明苏联裁军的诚意。
    在1956年7月的联合国裁军委员会的会议上，苏联再一次向西方国家作了让步，同意美国去年3月间在小组委员会提出过的关于五大国武装部队水平的数字，作为裁军的第一个步骤的数字。这样，剩下来的便只是那同裁军本身并不相干的“空中摄影”计划了。苏联为了早日就裁军问题达成协议，在1956年11月17日所发表的关于裁军和缓和国际紧张局势问题的声明中，又表示愿意考虑这一问题，即在北大西洋公约集团和华沙条约成员国主要武装力量所驻扎的欧洲地区（分界线东西各八百公里以内）实行空中摄影。
    苏联政府所有这一切仁至义尽的真诚努力，所得到的答复却是今年年初美、英、法三国政府首脑在给布尔加宁主席的信中的冷淡态度。它们拒绝了苏联主张召开五国政府首脑会议讨论裁军问题的建议。
    十一年来的事实说明，各国人民所关心的裁军问题的谈判至今还未取得任何具体的协议，其责任完全在西方国家，主要在美国的身上。美国统治集团不顾“实力政策”不断遭受到的失败，一心妄想依靠所谓“威慑力量”来独霸世界，因而不愿意裁减军备，也不愿意禁止原子武器。固然，在各国人民和舆论的压力下，他们也不得不在口头上谈论裁军，而实际上执行的却是扩张军备的政策。最近，美国总统在他所发表的“国情咨文”中就继续公然鼓吹“实力政策”，美国下一年度的预算把军事开支增加到四百五十三亿美元的巨大数目。事实很显然，美国统治集团正在力图掀起新的扩张军备的热潮。
    但是，各国人民要求巩固和平和实现裁减军备、禁止原子武器的愿望是越来越不可违抗了。全世界爱好和平的力量制止了英、法、以对埃及的武装侵略，苏联新的裁军建议也给人们以争取和平的更大的信心。各国人民将继续为争取裁军协议的达成而努力。美国总统艾森豪威尔在给布尔加宁的信中表示愿意“在联合国范围内”讨论裁军问题，现在苏联代表已在联大政治委员会会议上建议，要求召开专门讨论裁军问题的联合国大会特别会议，美国和它的伙伴们是否将接受这个建议，这将是对它们是否愿意认真讨论裁军问题的一个考验。
