    Which One Should I Buy?
    In the department store in Xingtai City, Hebei Province, three "Pingzhun" brand thermometers manufactured by the "Shanghai Pingzhun Instrument Factory" are lined up on the counter. They look very nice, and I plan to buy one to take home. However, upon closer inspection, the readings on the three thermometers, which are less than ten centimeters apart, are different: one reads ten degrees, one reads nine degrees, and the other reads eight degrees. Which one should I buy?

    该买哪一只呢
    河北省邢台市百货公司的柜台里横排着三只“上海平准仪器厂”制造的“平准”牌寒暑表，样子很好看，我准备买一只带回家去。但是仔细一看，相隔不到十公分的三个寒暑表的度数，一只是十度，一只是九度，另一只却是八度。我该买哪一只呢？　　　　秦台
