Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 29th: Nearly 10,000 workers from the Wangfeng, Lifeng, No. 39 Well, and Xiaomacun coal mines under the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau have enthusiastically responded to the State Council's call. They have proposed guaranteeing no rest or only one day of rest during the Spring Festival holiday, striving to increase raw coal production by 50,000 tons for the state in the first quarter. As of January 28th, the workers of these four coal mines had already produced more than 20,000 tons of coal beyond the January plan.

Many workers in these four coal mines originally planned to visit relatives and friends during the Spring Festival holiday. After hearing the notification from the State Council conveyed by the mine leaders, they have now changed their plans and will continue production as usual on the second and third days of the lunar new year. 96% of the workers in the No. 39 Well have formulated attendance guarantees for the second and third days of the lunar new year. Han Shufeng, a worker at the Xiaomacun Mine, has not returned to his hometown (Shanxi) in the six years since he came to Jiaozuo in 1951. Recently, he received five consecutive letters from his family urging him to return home for marriage. He had already applied to the mine for twenty days of leave, preparing to go back during the Spring Festival. After hearing the State Council's notification, he proposed to the leadership that he would not take leave during the Spring Festival and told his family to prepare for the wedding to be postponed.

The five directors and deputy directors of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau and the mine directors of each mine plan to go deep into the mines during the Spring Festival and spend the holiday with the workers in intense production.

Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 29th: People in the Datong and Yangquan mining areas are joyfully welcoming the Spring Festival. All the cooks of the Xinzhou Kiln Mine of the Datong Coal Mine, in order to encourage the miners to work diligently during the two-day holiday of the Spring Festival, guarantee that everyone will eat a variety of delicious meals within three days. More than 700 family members of workers at the Fourth Mine of the Yangquan Mining Bureau have organized to help single workers wash clothes and make dumplings.

The State Council's call and the enthusiastic support of the people have deeply moved the miners. More than 80 workers of the Datong Mining Bureau who had already bought train tickets to go home for the Spring Festival have returned their tickets. Workers in many units have expressed their guarantee of 100% attendance. The 81st coal mining team of the Fourth Mine of the Yangquan Mining Bureau challenged all the workers of the bureau with a guarantee of full attendance. More than 300 people in this mine originally planned to go home, but now they have decided to stay and participate in production. Cui Fengqi, a coal miner who has been working in the mine for less than a year, said: If I go home alone for the holiday, many people will not have coal to burn and will not have a good holiday. That won't do!

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 29th: All the workers of the Tongchuan Coal Mine in Shaanxi Province are resolutely responding to the State Council's call and guaranteeing to increase coal production by 4,300 tons for the state during the Spring Festival.

On the 28th, Pang Zhenhua, Deputy Director of the Xi'an Coal Administration Bureau, led a work team to the Tongchuan Coal Mine. They will assist the mines in carrying out mechanical repairs before the Spring Festival and spend the Spring Festival with the coal miners. The Tongchuan Mining Bureau has also organized a work team of more than 80 people, led by responsible comrades, to go to the mines to provide specific assistance.

    焦作矿务局五个正副局长和各矿矿长，都计划在春节期间深入矿井，同工人们一起在紧张的生产中度过春节。
    本报太原29日电　大同、阳泉两个矿区的人们，正兴高采烈地迎接春节。大同煤矿忻州窑矿的全体炊事员，为鼓励矿工们在春节的两天假日里勤奋劳动，保证让大家在三天内吃到各种美味的饭菜。阳泉矿务局四矿有七百多名职工家属组织起来，准备帮助单身工人洗衣服，包饺子。
    国务院的号召和人们的热情支持，使矿工们非常感动。大同矿务局有八十多名已经买好车票准备回家过春节的职工都退了票。许多单位的工人都表示保证百分之百出勤。阳泉矿务局四矿八十一采煤队以保证全勤向全局职工挑战。这个矿原有三百多人打算回家，现在都决定留下来参加生产。到矿山来不到一年的采煤工人崔凤岐说：我一个人回家过节，叫很多人没有煤烧，过不好节，这可不行！
    据新华社西安29日电　陕西省铜川煤矿的全体职工，坚决响应国务院号召，保证在春节期间给国家增产四千三百吨煤。
