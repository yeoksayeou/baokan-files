Xinhua News Agency, January 12th. (TASS, New York, January 11th) - American newspapers, in commenting on Macmillan's assumption of the British Prime Ministership, openly demanded that Britain submit to the United States.

    The "New York Times" said that Macmillan's "main task" lies in "eliminating the divisions that still exist between British-American relations and restoring the old close relationship between them."
    
    The "Washington Post and Times-Herald" pointed out that in the new British-American alliance, Britain's role is to be a compliant executor of American will. The newspaper wrote: "The reality of the situation requires the British to recognize the power of the United States in the free world, instead of the long-standing demand for independent action." The newspaper emphasized: "If the British try too strongly to expect to restore traditional ties with the Americans, many difficulties will arise in the future."
    
    Walter Lippmann, an observer for the "New York Herald Tribune," said that due to the failure of British power and the proposal of the Eisenhower Doctrine, cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Middle East is out of the question. Lippmann emphasized that the United States needs to cooperate with Britain in Europe, namely in its relations with Eastern European countries.

    美国报纸给麦克米伦来个下马威
    要约翰牛让山姆大叔牵着鼻子走
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社纽约11日讯：美国报纸在评论麦克米伦出任英国首相的时候，公开要求英国屈从美国。
    “纽约时报”说，麦克米伦的“主要任务”是在于“消除目前仍然存在的英美关系间的分裂，恢复它们之间旧有的密切关系。”
    “华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”指出，在新的英美联盟中，英国的角色就是美国意志的顺从执行者。这家报纸写道：“现实局势要求英国人承认美国在自由世界中的威力，以代替很久以前就曾经提出来的单独行动的要求。”报纸强调指出：“如果英国人试图过于强烈地指望恢复同美国人的传统联系，今后将会发生很多困难。”
    “纽约先驱论坛报”观察家李普曼说，由于英国势力的失败和艾森豪威尔主义的提出，英美在中东的合作是谈不到的。李普曼强调说，美国在欧洲，即在对待东欧国家关系上需要同英国合作。
