Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, January 9th: "Today's News" published an editorial today, satirizing US President Eisenhower as the "self-appointed protector" of Middle Eastern countries.

The newspaper said that the entire history of the Middle East proves that only Western countries threaten the region.

"Today's News" pointed out that Eisenhower's proposal itself also illustrates this. "What President Eisenhower values is not the integrity and independence of Arab countries, but the resources of this region. He has expressed his willingness to provide a bribe of $400 million for the sake of these resources."

Xinhua News Agency, January 9th: TASS, Beirut, January 8th: The Lebanese "Telegraph" wrote in its commentary on US President Eisenhower's Middle East policy message to Congress: "The independence of Middle Eastern countries is in danger because the United States plans to openly interfere in the internal affairs of these countries."

The newspaper emphasized: "No matter under what pretext they try to enslave the Arab East, this attempt will be completely bankrupt."

Published in Arabic, "Neighbor News" wrote: "President Eisenhower only spoke of American interests in the Middle East and these interests require American military and economic intervention, ostensibly to 'protect' the Middle East from 'communist influence'. However, the Arabs accept Soviet friendship not because of ideological considerations, but because the Arabs believe that this friendship can help them realize their hopes."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 8th: According to the Middle East News Agency, Lebanese Foreign Minister Charles Malik praised Eisenhower's Middle East plan yesterday, saying that the plan provides full guarantees for Lebanon's independence.

Malik's remarks to reporters at Cairo Airport on his way to New York were markedly different from the Arab world's criticism of the so-called Middle East "power vacuum" theory.

Malik said: Lebanon is willing to cooperate fully with the United States within the scope of independence and sovereignty. He also said that Lebanon certainly eagerly hopes to coordinate its policies with those of other Arab countries.

Xinhua News Agency, January 8th: The governments of Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, members of the Baghdad Pact military group, have expressed welcome to the Eisenhower Doctrine.

Turkish Prime Minister Menderes said on the 6th when meeting with a reporter from the Italian Milan "Evening Post" that the Eisenhower Doctrine is "a natural and justifiable result of the United States expressing concern and support for the Baghdad Pact." Menderes said that the situation in the Middle East is still "alarming and dangerous." He was referring to "the attitude of Egypt, the situation in Syria, and the Israeli problem," and he insisted on describing these as "several factors in the broader picture of Russia's expanding influence."

Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Adalan commented on Eisenhower's message to Congress on Middle East policy on the 6th, saying: "We like this statement very much."

A Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman said on the 7th: "The Pakistani government welcomes the solutions proposed by President Eisenhower on the Middle East issue and believes that they are aimed at enhancing economic and political stability and ensuring the security of the Middle East."

    巴基斯坦和黎巴嫩报纸抨击美国侵略计划
    土伊巴和黎巴嫩当局却附和“艾森豪威尔主义”
    据新华社卡拉奇9日电　“今天报”今天发表社论，讽刺美国总统艾森豪威尔是对中东国家的“自封的保护者”。
    这家报纸说，中东的全部历史证明，只有西方国家才是威胁这个地区的。
    “今天报”指出，艾森豪威尔的主张本身也说明了这一点。“艾森豪威尔总统所重视的，并不是阿拉伯国家的完整和独立，而是这个地区的富源，他表示愿意拿出四亿美元这样一笔拢络人心的款项来，也正是为了这种富源的缘故。”
    新华社9日讯　塔斯社贝鲁特8日讯：黎巴嫩“电讯报”在评论美国总统艾森豪威尔向国会提出的中东政策咨文的时候写道：“中东国家的独立处于危险之中，因为，美国计划公开地干涉这些国家的内政。”
    这家报纸着重指出：“无论他们在什么样的借口下来奴役阿拉伯东方国家，这种企图都必将遭到彻底的破产。”
    用阿拉伯文出版的“邻人报”写道：“艾森豪威尔总统所谈的只是美国在中东的利益和这些利益要求美国采取军事和经济的干涉，这样做好像为的是‘保护’中东不受‘共产主义的影响’。但是，阿拉伯人接受苏联的友谊不是由于意识形态方面的考虑，而是因为阿拉伯人认为这种友谊可以帮助他们实现自己的希望。”
    据新华社开罗8日电　据中东通讯社报道，黎巴嫩外交部长查尔斯·马利克昨天在这里称赞艾森豪威尔的中东计划，他说这个计划为黎巴嫩的独立提供了充分的保证。
    马利克在前往纽约途中在开罗机场对记者所说的这番话，同阿拉伯国家舆论对所谓中东“势力真空”的论调的抨击有明显的不同。
    马利克说：黎巴嫩愿意在独立和主权的范围内同美国进行最充分的合作。他同时又说，黎巴嫩当然迫切地希望使它的政策能同其他阿拉伯国家的政策协调一致。
    据新华社8日讯　巴格达条约军事集团成员国土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦的政府表示欢迎艾森豪威尔主义。
    土耳其总理曼德列斯6日在接见意大利米兰“晚邮报”记者的时候说，艾森豪威尔主义是“美国对巴格达条约表示关心和支持的理所当然的自然的结果”。曼德列斯说，中东局势仍然“惊人和危险”。他这样说的时候指的是“埃及的态度、叙利亚局势和以色列问题”，他硬把这些说成是“俄国的势力在扩大的更广阔的图景中的几个因素”。
    伊朗外交大臣阿里·阿达兰6日评论艾森豪威尔向国会提出的关于中东政策的咨文时说：“我们很喜欢这个声明。”
    巴基斯坦外交部发言人7日说：“巴基斯坦政府欢迎艾森豪威尔总统在中东问题上所提出的那些办法，认为它们的目的在于增进经济和政治的稳定和确保中东的安全。”
