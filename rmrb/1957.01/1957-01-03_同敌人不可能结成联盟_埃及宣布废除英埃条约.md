Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 2nd. Cairo Radio broadcast on the evening of January 1st an order signed by Egyptian President Nasser, announcing the abolition of the 1954 Anglo-Egyptian treaty on the military base in the Suez Canal Zone.

President Nasser's order pointed out that the tripartite aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel was a violation of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty by the British side. The British government "had prepared an attack on Egyptian territory together with the armies of France and Israel, and invaded the Suez Canal area on October 31, 1956, and has been acting like this ever since, as if the aforementioned treaty did not exist."

President Nasser's order declared that the laws stipulating the Anglo-Egyptian treaty and its annexes, and all documents related to the treaty, were considered invalid. The cabinet resolution announced in November 1954 stipulating the conclusion of the treaty and its annexes was also considered invalid.

The Director of the Egyptian Information Department, Hatem, said in a speech on Cairo Radio that evening that the Anglo-Egyptian treaty was concluded on the basis of future friendly relations between Britain and Egypt. The preamble to this treaty mentioned that Britain and Egypt signed this agreement in order to establish mutual understanding and mutual friendship as the basis for their future relations.

Hatem said: "But Britain launched an aggression against Egypt on October 31, killing Egyptian children and destroying Egyptian facilities, thereby trampling on the principles of human rights, which abolished this agreement. Finally, it became an accomplice of France and Israel, because France and Israel attempted to impose foreign rule on the Egyptian people."

Hatem said: "Considering that bilateral agreements concluded between two countries to strengthen their relations or cooperation are automatically abolished once one of the contracting parties launches a war or aggression against the other party, we believe that the Anglo-Egyptian Friendship Treaty concluded on October 19, 1954, was abolished due to the actions taken by Britain against Egypt on October 31, 1956."

Hatem also accused Britain of using its veto power when the Egyptian issue was debated in the United Nations Security Council on October 30, and of occupying part of Egyptian territory on November 5, 1956, despite the dissatisfaction of the majority of United Nations member states.

Hatem also said that the Egyptian government had instructed Foreign Minister Fawzi to notify the United Nations of this action.

The Anglo-Egyptian treaty, signed in Cairo on October 19, 1954, stipulated that British troops should completely withdraw from the Suez Canal Zone within twenty months. It also stipulated that British troops had the right to return to the Suez Canal Zone base in the event of an armed attack by a foreign country on any country participating in the Arab League at the time or Turkey. During the seven-year term of validity of this treaty, Britain had the right to send civilians to maintain and maintain its base in the Suez Canal Zone.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 2nd. "The Republic" published a commentary today on Egypt's announcement of the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty, saying that Britain conspired with France and Israel to jointly invade Egypt while a friendly treaty was still considered valid.

The newspaper pointed out: "Britain violated all the provisions of the treaty, as well as international law and practice. In this case, any treaty between the two countries is abolished."

It also pointed out that "Egypt's notification to the United Nations of the abolition (of this treaty) is not writing a death sentence for this treaty. It was already strangled on the day Britain launched its aggression against Egypt."

"Al-Ahram" said today, "Britain is an enemy of Egypt, and no alliance can be formed with enemies, because Egypt's policy is based on being friendly to friends and opposing enemies."

The newspaper said that it would have been natural for Egypt to announce the abolition of the treaty when Britain violated the Anglo-Egyptian treaty at the end of July last year. However, Egypt continued to express patience, waiting for Britain to possibly regain its senses and change its aggressive policy. But Britain continued to implement the policy of barbaric and criminal attacks against the Egyptian people.

    同敌人不可能结成联盟
    埃及宣布废除英埃条约
    新华社开罗2日电　开罗电台在1月1日晚上广播了埃及总统纳赛尔签署的一个命令，宣布废除1954年埃及同英国签订的关于苏伊士运河区军事基地的条约。
    纳赛尔总统的命令指出，英、法、以色列三国对埃及发动的侵略是英国方面对英埃条约的破坏。英国政府“曾经同法国和以色列的军队一起准备了对埃及领土的进攻，并且在1956年10月31日进犯了苏伊士运河地区，自从那时以来一直这样行动，好像上述条约并不存在。”
    纳赛尔总统的命令宣布，规定英埃条约和附件的法律以及一切有关这个条约的文件被认为无效。1954年11月公布的规定达成这个条约和附件的内阁决议也被认为无效。
    埃及情报司长哈特姆当天晚上在开罗电台发表谈话说，英埃条约是在英国和埃及之间将来的友好关系的基础上缔结的。这项条约在序言中提到，英国和埃及签订这项协定，为的是建立互相谅解和互相友好作为它们将来的关系的基础。
    哈特姆说：“但是英国在10月31日对埃及发动了侵略，杀害了埃及的儿童，破坏了埃及的设施，从而蹂躏了人类权利的原则，这就废除了这项协定。最后，它成为法国和以色列的同谋犯，因为法国和以色列企图把外来的统治强加于埃及人民。”
    哈特姆说：“考虑到两国间为了加强它们的关系或合作而缔结的双边协定，在一旦发生缔约国一方对他方发动战争或侵略的时候就自动地废除，我们认为：在1954年10月19日缔结的英埃友好条约由于英国在1956年10月31日对埃及采取的行动而废除了。
    哈特姆还指责英国10月30日在联合国安全理事会中辩论埃及问题的时候使用否决权，以及它不顾大多数联合国会员国的不满，在1956年11月5日占领一部分埃及领土。
    哈特姆还说，埃及政府已经训令外交部长法齐把这个行动通知联合国。
    1954年10月19日在开罗签订的英埃条约，规定英军要在二十个月内完全撤出苏伊士运河区，同时还规定在当时参加阿拉伯联盟的任何国家或土耳其遭到外来国家武装进攻时，英国军队有权再回到苏伊士运河区基地，并且在这个条约有效期限的七年内，英国有权派遣平民维持和保养它在苏伊士运河区的基地。
    新华社开罗2日电　“共和国报”今天就埃及宣布废除英埃条约的行动发表评论说，英国是在一项友好条约被认为还是有效的时候，同法国和以色列阴谋联合侵略埃及的。
    这家报纸指出：“英国违反了条约的所有规定，以及国际法和惯例，在这种情况下，这就废除了两个国家之间的任何条约。”
    它还指出，“埃及把废除（这个条约）的行动通知联合国，并不是为这个条约写下死刑执行命令。它已经在英国对埃及发动侵略的那一天就被扼死了。”
    “金字塔报”今天说，“英国是埃及的敌人，同敌人是不能成为联盟的，因为埃及的政策是以同朋友友好、反对敌人的态度为基础的”。
    这家报纸说，在英国在去年7月底违反英埃条约的时候，埃及就宣布废除这个条约，这本来就是很自然的事。但是，埃及继续表示耐心，等待英国可能恢复清醒的头脑并且改变它的侵略政策。可是英国却继续执行对埃及人民进行野蛮的罪恶进攻的政策。
