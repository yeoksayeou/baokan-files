Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 13th: Syrian conspirators who attempted to launch an armed coup in Syria confessed in military court on the 12th that "Americans in Beirut" had close ties with the conspirators.

One of the defendants, Lieutenant Colonel Hakim, former Syrian military attaché to Egypt, told the court that Colonel Safa, former Syrian military attaché to the United States, had told him that someone had told the Americans in the Lebanese capital that a coup would take place in Syria within the next two days. Two days later, Safa told him that the Americans said the coup "did not happen because the planners were not fully prepared to carry it out at that time."

Hakim also said that the leader of the Syrian National Socialist Party, Colonel Safa, and Colonel Samira'i, the Iraqi military attaché to Lebanon, had plotted the coup in Beirut. Hakim pointed out that Samira'i had said: "The (Iraqi) government is prepared to financially and with weapons assist any group that wants to overthrow the current Syrian regime."

During the same day's trial, another defendant, parliamentarian and former minister Munir al-Ajlani, revealed that the United States was using money to carry out conspiracies in Syria and interfere in Syria's internal affairs in the name of "resisting communism." According to al-Ajlani, someone told him that the United States was paying money to "resist communism" in Syria.

Al-Ajlani said that another defendant, parliamentarian Hasani al-Atrash, had told him that al-Atrash himself had met an "American figure" last year who had come to Syria to organize a so-called "resistance to communism" movement. After this meeting, al-Atrash bought the Damascus newspaper "Al-Aliba," and the newspaper's editorial policy immediately turned to anti-communism.

Another defendant, Adnan Edd, confirmed al-Ajlani's words. He said that after meeting with that American, al-Atrash began sending American money to the Druze Mountains to "resist communism."

The trial will continue.

    叙利亚阴谋分子供认
    美国佬是策划政变的牵线人
    新华社13日讯　大马士革消息：曾经企图在叙利亚发动武装政变的阴谋分子12日在军事法庭上供认，“在贝鲁特的美国人”同阴谋分子有密切联系。
    被告之一、前叙利亚驻埃及武官哈基姆中校在法庭上说，前叙利亚驻美国武官萨法上校曾经告诉他，有人告诉在黎巴嫩首都的美国人，在第二天内叙利亚将发生政变。两天后，萨法又告诉他，美国人说，政变“没有发生，因为策划者当时还没有为进行政变作好充分的准备”。
    哈基姆还说，叙利亚国家社会党的领袖、萨法上校和伊拉克驻黎巴嫩武官萨米赖上校曾经在贝鲁特策划这次政变阴谋。哈基姆指出，萨米赖曾经说过：“（伊拉克）政府准备在财政上和用武器帮助要推翻叙利亚现政权的任何集团”。
    在同一天的审讯中，另一名被告、议员和前部长穆尼尔·阿吉拉尼透露，美国在“抵抗共产主义”的名义下，使用金钱在叙利亚进行阴谋活动，干涉叙利亚的内政。据阿吉拉尼说，有人告诉他，美国在出钱用来在叙利亚“抵抗共产主义”。
    阿吉拉尼说，另外一名被告、议员哈萨尼·阿特拉什曾经告诉他，阿特拉什自己在去年会见了一个“美国人物”，这个人到叙利亚的目的是为了组织所谓“抵抗共产主义”的运动。阿特拉什在这次会面之后，收买了大马士革的“阿利巴日报”，这家报纸的编辑政策立即就转向反共。
    另一名被告阿德南·埃德证实阿吉拉尼的话。他说，阿特拉什在同那个美国人会面之后，就开始把美国的金钱送到德鲁士山区去“抵抗共产主义”。
    审讯将继续进行。
