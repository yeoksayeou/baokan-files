    Childlike Innocence
    Bao Chang
    Looking back ten years from now, children at that time could easily abandon their studies and go astray. On the streets of Beijing, I personally witnessed children engaging in gang fights, with dozens of people gathered on each side, brandishing wooden sticks and throwing bricks and stones. In an instant, heads would be broken and blood would flow, and the police were unable to control it. Children at that time often became guilty of obstructing traffic.
    In the few years since Liberation, children have truly become the little masters of the country. If you don't believe it, look at those children who used to obstruct traffic, now they are helping to maintain traffic order.
    Not long ago, I saw a live drama on the street. A man dressed in cadre clothing was riding a bicycle through the night streets. The bicycle had no lights on, so a child wearing a red scarf stood out and shouted, "Comrade, please turn on your light!" But the man didn't even turn his head and rode away. "Dong, dong, dong" - I watched the child chase after him, running desperately behind and shouting all the way, "Stop! Stop!" Needless to say, everyone was attracted to the scene. After running almost the distance of two lampposts, he finally grabbed the cyclist's collar. As a result, the cyclist got off the bike, angrily pushed the child three or four feet away, and said angrily, "What are you doing? Are you trying to start a fight?"
    The child was not intimidated by this, and said righteously, "I want you to turn on your light!"
    When the cyclist saw people gathering around, he suddenly changed his tone, stroked the child's head, and said, "Little classmate, why are you so unaware of the danger? There are so many vehicles on the road. If you run around in the street, what if you get hit by a car? Huh?! Huh?!..." He said "Huh?!" several times and then left. The crowd dispersed. Only the child was left standing there, not knowing whether to cry or laugh.
    This incident lingered in my mind for a long time. I was moved by the child's aggrieved but unwavering eyes. Yes, who is the one who is truly unaware?
    I think that if a more worldly person were in the same situation, after the first shout of "Turn on your light!" failed, they might just sigh and walk away. They might not even shout at all. But the child insisted, shouting again and again, and bravely chasing after him, not stopping until he achieved his goal. This is a childlike innocence, a truly innocent and lovely character. It is sad that some people have lost this childlike innocence and, without realizing it, even denounce it as "unaware."
    Of course, forgetting the danger in order to chase someone; or neglecting effective methods and approaches in order to overcome mistakes, can be considered "naive" or "unaware." But, if you had "consciously" stopped after the child's first shout, I don't think the child would have run into the road, and he could only give you a pleasant smile.
    There are many such things in life. Aren't many young people suffering like Nastya? Aren't many new forces in conflict with conservative forces and陷入into distress? This is very easy to solve. The key is for the person who made the mistake to stop after hearing the first shout, bring out their childlike innocence, and shake the hand of the person who shouted at them. At that time, I believe that we will feel more clear and happy in our lives.

    童心
    鲍昌
    从现在起，倒数十年上去，那时的孩子，是很容易荒废学业而走入歧途的。在北京街头，我就亲眼看到孩子们在打群架，双方各聚有数十人，木棍齐举，砖石乱飞，须臾间就头破血流，而警察是管不了的。那时的儿童们常会成为妨碍交通的罪人。
    解放后几年来，儿童们真是成了国家小主人。不信，请看那过去曾妨碍交通的儿童们，如今却来帮助维持交通秩序了。
    前不久，我在街头上看见一幕活剧。有一个身穿干部服的男人，骑着自行车在夜的街头上驰过。车上没开灯，于是，就站出来一个带着红领巾的孩子，吆喝道：“同志，请开灯！”但那人连头也不回，径自骑走。“咚咚咚”——我看那儿童追上去，他拚命在后面追着，而且一路喊道：“站住！站住！”不消说，行人都被吸引住了。几乎跑了两根电线杆子的距离，他终于抓住了骑自行车人的衣襟。这样一来，车上的人下来了，怒气冲冲地用手一推，就把那儿童推出三四尺远，气咻咻地说：“你干什么，要打架吗？”
    孩子并没有因此吓退，义正词严地说：“我要你点灯！”
    那骑车的人一看人围上来，忽然把语调一换，抚着孩子的头说：“小同学，你怎么这么不自觉呵。马路上车辆有多少，你在街上跑来跑去，叫车撞着了怎么办？呵？！呵？！……”他连说了几个“呵？！”字，便扬长而去。人们也散了。只剩下那个孩子，站在那里哭也不是，笑也不是。
    这件事萦绕在我的脑海里，许久也未散去。我为那个孩子的委屈的、但是又无疑惑的眼睛而激动着。是的，倒底是谁不自觉呢？
    我想，倘是一个世故较深的人，则在第一次吆喝“点灯”失效之后，也可能就喟然一叹，走路完事。甚至连吆喝一声也未必。但小孩子偏不，偏要吆喝再三，而且奋勇追上去，不达目的决不休止。这是一种童心，一种多么天真多么可爱的性格。令人可悲的是：有些人已经失掉了这种童心，自己不自觉，反而痛斥这种童心为“不自觉”。
    当然，因为要追人，便忘记了危险；因为要克服错误，便忽略各种有效的方式方法，这也可以算是
  “幼稚”或“不自觉”。可是，假如当那孩子喊了第一声之后，你就先“自觉”地站住了，我想，那孩子决不会在马路上跑起来，他只能对你施以愉快的微笑了。
    生活中正是有许多这样的事情的。不是有许多青年人正在像娜斯嘉一样的苦恼么？不是有许多新生力量同保守势力起了冲突而陷入苦恼之中么？这是很好解决的，关键在于犯了错误的人，在听了第一声吆喝之后就煞住脚，拿出自己的童心来，去握住那吆喝你的人的手。这时，我相信，我们在生活中就会更加感到明朗和愉快了。
