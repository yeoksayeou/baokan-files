    Before the New Year, on December 10th, I bathed in the winter sunlight and came to a corner of Poyang Lake – the Raobu Township Agricultural Production Cooperative.
    This cooperative is a large one, established in the spring of last year, consisting of 3,032 households, encompassing 48 li in circumference. After the cooperative was established, the Party branch and the management committee led everyone to do several major things.
    First, they unified the planning and construction of water conservancy projects. All 41 villages in the cooperative are located within the embankment. In previous years, villages in higher terrain wanted to keep the water within the embankment as full as possible to store water for drought prevention; villages in lower terrain, however, wanted to drain the water within the embankment as clean as possible to prevent waterlogging disasters. Thus, there were years of fighting between the higher and lower villages, resulting in bloodshed and five lives lost. Armed conflicts continued until the early days of liberation. With the development of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, the contradictions were somewhat eased, but not completely resolved. Every year, more than 4,000 mu of farmland suffered from waterlogging disasters, resulting in a loss of more than one million jin of grain. The state had to supply more than three million jin of grain every year. After the transition to advanced cooperatives, this historical contradiction was resolved. The 3,000 households of farmers became one big family, fighting against water disasters together. They put forward the slogan "Deep ditches and high dams, defeat disasters!" They built three large dams and 28 small dams in Zhangjiaqiao, which is in higher terrain, to store water for drought prevention. In Shujiahu, which is in lower terrain, they opened an 8-foot-wide, 4-foot-deep, and 300-zhang-long flood discharge channel to remove waterlogging from within the embankment. At the same time, they repaired 360,000 cubic meters of embankment. In this way, the embankment became safer, the flood resistance outside the embankment was enhanced, and the disaster area within the embankment was reduced. Last year, 1,500 mu of lake fields, which used to yield nothing nine years out of ten, became fertile land, increasing grain production by 630,000 jin, with an average yield of more than 400 jin of rice per mu.
    Another thing they did was to mobilize cooperative members to launch a surprise campaign to accumulate fertilizer. Under the leadership of cooperative cadres, everyone got up early and worked late to accumulate fertilizer. Within two months, the entire cooperative carried 2.96 million dan of pond mud, eliminating "sanitary fields" (meaning fields without fertilizer), and greatly improving the soil. The Fengshan production team used to have more than 150 mu of dead mud fields, and the harvest was always poor. After applying a large amount of fertilizer, they became active mud fields, and the output increased significantly. The entire cooperative has 8,200 mu of land, with an average grain yield of 1,051 jin per mu, setting a high-yield record for a large area in Poyang County. The Raobu cooperative began selling surplus grain for the first time. From then on, the Raobu cooperative's name spread throughout Poyang Lake.
    One of the main characteristics of the Raobu cooperative is that there are more people than land. Each laborer only manages about three mu of land. About 210,000 labor days need to find a way out. According to the principle of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily," the Party branch and the management committee relied on the cooperative members to find ways and explore opportunities. The cooperative engages in a variety of large and small sideline productions, including fishing, shipbuilding, collective pig raising, kiln burning, stone quarrying, rafting, boat rowing, net weaving, making bamboo hats, making boat awnings, excavating lakes, digging clam shells, repairing roads, oil pressing, milling, firewood gathering, pushing carts, beekeeping, raising chickens, raising ducks, sericulture, hunting, private pig raising, and helping farms build reservoirs, totaling 24 items. In fishing alone, the entire cooperative dispatched 80 boats, earning 13,200 yuan in three months.
    Pens full of fat pigs and flocks of chickens and ducks. This is an important sideline production of the Raobu cooperative. In the past, the cooperative only had 1,053 pigs. Due to the solution of the pig source problem, poor households received loans, and pigs were generally vaccinated for epidemic prevention. Now, it has developed to more than 1,900 pigs.
    The total sideline income for the year was more than 330,000 yuan, accounting for 29.3% of the total annual income. The average sideline income per household was over 100 yuan. The total agricultural and sideline income for the year was more than 1.13 million yuan. After deducting various expenses, 97% of the cooperative members increased their income. The remuneration for each labor day was one yuan, one jiao, and two fen. Generally, a strong laborer's annual income was between 280-290 yuan and 330 yuan. The average net income per person in the cooperative was 87 yuan and nine jiao. Xu Yinhua, a cooperative member of the Sanmen team, had a labor income of 586 yuan for the whole year.
    After the distribution, everyone was happy and every family was joyous, and there was an atmosphere of jubilation everywhere. The entire cooperative added 5,065 cotton-padded clothes and 792 cotton quilts and mosquito nets. Ding Wenming, a 64-year-old cooperative member of the Luwo team, used to be so poor that he didn't have a quilt and spent long years covering himself with straw raincoats and sleeping in firewood nests. After the distribution, apart from food and cooking oil for his family of four, he bought two new cotton quilts, ate his fill, slept warm, and still saved more than 100 yuan in the credit cooperative. His wife, Chen Fengxiu, said to the captain: "My family lacks nothing now. Please help my son find a wife." Xu Fanggu, 58 years old, went to town one day to buy a cotton quilt and told everyone he met: "I suffered for decades, and this year I finally have a new quilt to cover myself with." One evening, in the home of Li Zhifeng, a cooperative member of the Qiaonan production team, a family of three gathered around the lamp, calculating their household expenses. His son, Li Jinpeng, spoke first: "This year, our income has increased. We can no longer be as poor as we used to be. I want to have more banquets when I get married..." His mother, Xu Hehua, interjected: "Son! In the old society, we were beggars. Now we have become money-rich households. We must not forget our roots when we turn over and live frugally." Zhifeng nodded repeatedly after hearing this, and Jinpeng also agreed with the elders' opinions.
    The cooperative provided meticulous care and assistance to the 230 "Five Guarantees" households, totaling 395 people. In addition to receiving food rations, the cooperative also made 121 lined clothes and 15 cotton quilts for them. Now, they are no longer helpless "lonely and widowed" people, but happy members of the socialist big family.
    With the development of production, people's cultural life has also become active. Now, there are 71 middle school students in the entire cooperative, an increase of 69% compared to last spring, and 1,620 elementary school students, an increase of 67.9% compared to last spring. The entire cooperative opened 35 cultural study classes and made more than 3,000 literacy cards to hang at the doors of cooperative members, teaching them to read in connection with their central work. Twenty-six young people in the Qiaonan team have persisted in studying for a long time. At present, they can generally recognize more than 1,000 characters.
    A year is very short, but the changes that have taken place in this year are so great. People use heroic labor to change the face of the land and rivers, and also change the relationships and spiritual outlook between people. They are harmonious and united, loving and caring for each other. In the past, Xu Dasheng, a cooperative member of the Qunli team, emphasized historical customs and built a wall in front of the door of cooperative member Xu Yusheng. For a long time, Xu Yusheng had a door but no road and had to make a big detour to get out. In the new life, Xu Dasheng was educated and took the initiative to tear down the wall, leaving a road. Since then, the "wall" in the hearts of the two has also been demolished. Xu Xinren, a cooperative member of the Luwo team, was in financial difficulties, and his wife, Xu Dong'e, clamored for a divorce every year. Now that life is better, the couple loves each other. The cooperative members have full democratic life. In addition to the normal democratic system, the cooperative has set up five suggestion boxes. From February to mid-December last year, a total of 354 suggestions were received. Among them, in addition to opinions criticizing the ideological style of cooperative cadres, there were 214 rationalization proposals. These opinions have played a huge role in consolidating agricultural cooperatives and improving production. A deputy captain of a team had a bad style, was corrupt and embezzled, and was removed from his post after being reported by cooperative members. Everyone said: "The cooperative talks about democracy, we are in charge and make our own decisions."

    鄱阳湖畔喜气洋洋
    张士光
    新年前，12月10日，我沐着冬天的阳光，来到了鄱阳湖的一角——饶埠乡农业生产合作社。
    这个社是去年春季建成的三千零三十二户的大社。周围方圆四十八里。社建成后党支部和管委会就领导大家做了几件大事。
    首先是统一规划兴修水利。全社四十一个村，全都落在圩内。往年，地势高的村子要把圩内的积水留满些，蓄水防旱；地势低的村子，却要把圩内渍水排泄干净以防渍水成灾。这样，高村与低村之间就连年动刀动枪，曾经流过血，伤过五条人命，直到解放初期还进行着械斗。随着互助合作组织的发展，矛盾虽然有了某些缓和，但仍不能彻底解决。每年仍有四千多亩田渍水成灾，损失一百多万斤粮食。每年要由国家供应三百多万斤口粮。转高级社后，这个历史上的矛盾解决了。三千户农民成为一个大家庭，大家共同来和水灾作斗争。他们提出了“深沟高坝，战胜灾害”的口号，在地势高的张家桥修了三个大水坝和二十八个小水坝，蓄水防旱；在地势低的舒家湖开了一条八尺宽、四尺深、三百多丈长的排洪道，排除圩内渍水。同时培修了三十六万方圩堤。这样，圩堤安全，圩外增强了抗洪力量，圩内减少了受灾面积，那些十年九不收的湖田，去年就有一千五百亩变成良田，增产了六十三万斤粮食，平均每亩收谷四百多斤。
    另一件事就是发动社员突击积肥。在社干部的带头下，大家起早摸黑突击积肥。在两个月内，全社就挑了二百九十六万担塘泥，消灭了“卫生田”（地里不施肥之意），大大地改良了土壤。凤山生产队过去有一百五十多亩死泥田，收成老是不好，经施用大量肥料之后，变成了活泥田，产量有了显著的增加。全社有八千二百亩田，平均每亩收粮食一千零五十一斤。创造了鄱阳县大面积丰收的高产纪录，饶埠社开始第一次卖余粮。从此，饶埠社的名声传遍了整个鄱阳湖。
    人多田少，是饶埠社的主要特点之一。每个劳动力只负担三亩来田。约有二十一万多个劳动日要找出路。党支部和管委会根据“勤俭办社”的方针，依靠社员群众想办法，找门路，全社经营的大小型副业生产，计有打鱼、造船、集体养猪、烧窑、打石、放排、撑船、结网、做斗笠、打船篷、堑湖、扒蚌壳、修公路、榨油、磨粉、打柴、推车、养蜂、养鸡、养鸭、养蚕、打猎、私人养猪、帮助农场修水库等二十四项。光是打鱼，全社抽出了八十只船，三个月就赚到了一万三千二百多元。
    栏有肥猪，鸡鸭成群。这是饶埠社一项重要的副业生产。过去这个社只有猪一千零五十三头，由于解决了猪源问题，困难户得到贷款，普遍给猪打针防疫，现在已发展到一千九百多头。
    一年来的副业收入共三十三万多元，占全年总收入的29.3％，平均每户副业收入上百元。全年农副业收入共一百一十三万多元，除了各项开支，全社97％的社员增加了收入，每个劳动日的报酬一元一角二分，一般的一个壮劳动力全年收入在二百八九十元到三百三十元之间，全社每人平均纯收入八十七元九角。三门队社员徐银华，全年劳动收入五百八十六元。
    分配以后，人人高兴家家欢乐，到处一片喜气。全社添置了棉衣五千零六十五件，棉被、蚊帐七百九十二床。鹭窝队六十四岁的社员丁文明，过去穷得没有被子，盖蓑衣、睡柴窝，度过了漫长的岁月；分配后，除去全家四口的吃粮和油盐，新置了两床棉被，吃得饱，睡得暖，还存了一百多元在信用社。他的老伴陈风秀对队长说：“我家现在什么都不缺，请你帮我儿子找个媳妇吧。”五十八岁的徐方谷，一天到镇上买了一床棉絮，逢人就说：“受了几十年的罪，今年盖上新被了。”一天晚上，在乔南生产队社员李志丰的家里，一家三口围着灯火，合计家里的各项开支。儿子李锦朋先开口：“今年增加了收入，再也不能像过去那副穷相了，我结婚时要多办几桌喜酒……。”他母亲徐荷花抢着说：“崽呀！旧社会我们是讨饭人，现在成了长钱户，翻身不能忘本，要细水长流过日子。”志丰听了连连点头，锦朋也同意了两老的意见。
    全社的二百三十多户“五保”户计三百九十五人，也得到了社里无微不至的关怀与扶助。除分得了口粮外，社里还给他们做了一百二十一件夹衣，十五床棉被。现在他们再也不是六亲无靠的“孤寡”，而是社会主义大家庭中幸福的一员了。
    生产发展了，人民的文化生活也活跃起来了。现在全社有七十一个中学生，比去年春季增加了69％，小学生一千六百二十个，比去年春季增加了67.9％。全社开了三十五个文化学习班，做了三千多块识字牌挂在社员门口，结合中心工作教社员识字。乔南队二十六个青年长期坚持学习，目前一般的都能识一千多字了。
    一年的时间是很短暂的，可是这一年发生的变化却是这样大，人们用英雄的劳动改变土地和河川的面貌，也改变了人与人之间的关系和精神面貌，他们和睦团结，相亲相爱。过去，群力队社员徐大生强调历史习惯，在社员徐玉胜的门口筑了一道墙，长期以来，徐玉胜有门无路，要拐一个大弯才能出去；在新的生活中徐大生受到教育，主动把墙拆了，让出了一条路，自此两人心上的“墙”也拆除了。鹭窝队社员徐新仁因生活困难，妻子徐冬娥就年年吵着要离婚，现在生活过好了，夫妇两人相亲相爱了。社员们有充分的民主生活，除正常的民主制度外，社里设置了五个意见箱，自去年2月到12月中旬，共收到了三百五十四条意见。其中除有关批评社干部思想作风等意见外，合理化建议二百一十四件。这些意见，对巩固农业社和搞好生产起了巨大的作用。有一个队的副队长作风恶劣，贪污腐化，社员检举后，受到了撤职的处分。大家都说：“合作社，讲民主，自当家，自作主。”
