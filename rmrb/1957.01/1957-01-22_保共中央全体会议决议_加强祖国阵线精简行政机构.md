    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, January 21st: "Rabotnichesko Delo" reported on the 20th that the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party held a plenary session on January 17th, heard and discussed the report made by First Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, Zhivkov, on the significance and tasks of the Fatherland Front in the current situation, and the report made by Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Yugov, on the reorganization of several ministries and governing bodies.
    The plenary session made resolutions on these two reports.
    The resolution on Zhivkov's report stated that in the period since the Third Congress of the Fatherland Front, it has achieved great success in further strengthening the spiritual and political unity of the working people, in uniting the working people around the Bulgarian Communist Party and the people's democratic regime, in strengthening the friendship between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union, and in attracting the working people to participate more actively in state administration.
    The resolution said that the Fatherland Front should be strengthened so that it becomes the most mass-based, independent social-political organization, and that it should vividly embody the alliance of the working class, the working peasants, and the people's intellectuals.
    The resolution continued that the Fatherland Front should strive to develop and strengthen Bulgarian-Soviet friendship, because this friendship is the driving force for Bulgaria's social and economic development along the socialist road. A nationwide Bulgarian-Soviet friendship movement should be launched, which will be led by the Bulgarian-Soviet Friendship Committees in the capital and in various localities.
    The resolution on Yugov's report pointed out that in the twelve years since the establishment of the Bulgarian people's democratic regime, the cadres of the party, the government, and the economic departments have accumulated rich experience in their work. This makes it possible to streamline the state administrative organs in accordance with the current specific needs. In the past three years, the Bulgarian state administrative organs can be streamlined by at least 30%. The surplus personnel after the streamlining will be placed in departments engaged in material production.
    The resolution considers it appropriate to merge sixteen ministries and governing bodies into six. The merger of these ministries and governing bodies will remove superfluous links in these institutions, enable a more rational distribution and use of cadres, provide the possibility for further improving the leadership and organization of the ministries and governing bodies, and enhance their sense of responsibility in leading the national economy and serving the people.
    (Editor's Note) The Bulgarian Fatherland Front was established in the summer of 1942 and was an organization led by the Bulgarian Communist Party to unite all patriotic forces in the anti-fascist struggle. The parties that participated in the Fatherland Front at that time were the Bulgarian Workers' Party (Communist Party), the Agrarian Union, the "Zveno" People's Union (dissolved in February 1949), and the Social Democratic Party (dissolved in 1948). After liberation, the Fatherland Front was a powerful pillar for consolidating the people's democratic system. On February 2, 1948, the Fatherland Front held its Second Congress. Based on Dimitrov's proposal, the organization was reorganized into a unified mass-based social-political organization, and a new program for building socialism was drawn up. In May 1952, the Fatherland Front held its Third Congress.

    保共中央全体会议决议
    加强祖国阵线精简行政机构
    据新华社索非亚21日电　“工人事业报”20日报道，保加利亚共产党中央委员会在1月17日举行全体会议，听取并且讨论了保共中央第一书记日夫科夫所作的关于祖国阵线在目前情况下的意义和任务的报告和部长会议主席于哥夫所作的关于改组若干部和主管机关的报告。
    全体会议就这两个报告作出了决议。
    关于日夫科夫报告的决议说，祖国阵线在举行第三次代表大会以后的这段时期中，在进一步加强劳动人民精神上和政治上的团结方面，在把劳动人民团结到保加利亚共产党和人民民主政权的周围方面，在加强保加利亚和苏联的友谊方面，以及在吸引劳动人民更积极地参加国家管理方面都获得了很大的成就。
    决议说，应当加强祖国阵线，使它成为最具有群众性的独立的社会——政治组织，它应当活生生地体现工人阶级、劳动农民和人民知识分子的联盟。
    决议接着说，祖国阵线应当竭力发展和加强保苏友谊，因为这种友谊是保加利亚沿着社会主义道路求得社会和经济发展的推动力。应当展开一个全民的保苏友好运动，这个运动将由首都和各地的保苏友好委员会领导。
    关于于哥夫报告的决议中指出，从保加利亚人民民主政权建立十二年来，党和政府以及经济部门的干部在工作中积累了丰富的经验。这就有可能根据目前的具体需要来精简国家的行政机构。在最近三年内，保加利亚的国家行政管理机构最少能够精简30％，精简机构后的多余人员，将被安置在从事物质生产的部门。
    决议认为把十六个部和主管机关合并为六个是适宜的。这些部和主管机关的合并，将去掉这些机构中的多余环节，将能更合理地分配和使用干部，为进一步改善各部和主管机关的领导工作和组织工作提供可能性，提高它们在领导国民经济和为人民服务的工作责任心。
    （编者注）保加利亚祖国阵线成立于1942年夏，是保加利亚共产党领导下的团结国内一切爱国力量进行反法西斯斗争的组织。当时参加祖国阵线的党派有保加利亚工人党（共产党）、农民联盟、“环节”人民联盟（1949年2月解散）和社会民主党（1948年解散）。解放以后，祖国阵线是巩固人民民主制度的有力支柱。1948年2月2日，祖国阵线召开第二次代表大会，根据季米特洛夫的建议，将该组织改组为统一的群众性的社会政治组织，订出了建设社会主义的新纲领。1952年5月，祖国阵线举行了第三次代表大会。
