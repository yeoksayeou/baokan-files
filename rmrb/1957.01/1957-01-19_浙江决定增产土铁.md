Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Zhejiang Province's various indigenous iron production cooperatives have made a preliminary plan to produce more than 4,100 tons of indigenous iron this year, an increase of more than 140% compared to last year.

The area in Zhejiang Province producing indigenous iron is quite extensive. This type of indigenous iron is smelted from locally mined iron ore using handicraft production methods and can be directly used for steelmaking. In the past few years, due to poor leadership, the production methods for indigenous iron have been very backward. This year, the Zhejiang Provincial Handicraft Bureau plans to help indigenous iron production cooperatives in various regions increase the number of iron smelting stoves. It also plans to add a small blast furnace with a daily output of 15 to 20 tons in areas with concentrated indigenous iron production.

The Zhejiang Provincial Handicraft Department also plans to purchase more than 4,000 tons of scrap steel. Together with the output of indigenous iron, this can solve more than a quarter of the raw materials needed for the production of small agricultural implements throughout the province this year.

    浙江决定增产土铁
    据新华社讯　浙江省各地土铁生产合作社今年初步计划生产土铁四千一百多吨，比去年增加140％以上。
    浙江省生产土铁的地区很广。这种土铁是开采当地的铁矿石用手工业生产方式冶炼成的，可以直接用来炼钢。过去几年由于没有很好领导，土铁生产方法很落后。今年，浙江省手工业管理局准备帮助各地土铁生产合作社增加炼铁的炉灶，还计划在土铁集中的产区添建一座日产十五吨到二十吨的小高炉。
    浙江省手工业部门还计划收购废钢铁四千多吨，连同土铁的产量，就可以解决今年全省小型农具生产所需用的原料四分之一以上。
