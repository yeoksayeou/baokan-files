    Potato Planter
    The Soviet-style potato planter trial-manufactured by the Shanghai Joint State-Private Hongji Iron Factory underwent a planting test in the suburbs of Shanghai on the afternoon of the 21st.
    When the tractor pulled the planter across the field, the furrow openers in front of the planter opened four furrows in the ground, and potatoes and fertilizer were automatically planted in the furrows immediately. Then, the soil covering device behind the planter filled the furrows. With the planter passing through once, four rows of potatoes were planted on the land.
    This planter can complete the planting of 90 to 120 mu of land per day (based on 10 hours of work), which is much faster than manual planting by farmers and can reduce the labor intensity of farmers. (Xinhua News Agency)

    马铃薯播种机
    上海公私合营宏记铁工厂试制的仿苏式马铃薯播种机，21日下午在上海市郊进行了播种试验。
    当拖拉机拖着播种机在田间行驶的时候，播种机前面的开沟器便在地上开好四条沟，马铃薯和肥料马上自动地播在沟里。接着，播种机后面的复土器又把沟填好。播种机这样走过一趟，土地上就种好了四行马铃薯。
    这种播种机每天（按工作十小时计算）可以完成九十市亩到一百二十市亩土地的播种工作，比农民用人工播种要快得多，并且可以减轻农民操作的劳累。　（新华社）
