Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, 28th. Premier Zhou Enlai said to over one hundred business people in Kathmandu on the afternoon of the 27th that trade between Nepal and the Tibet region of China could be further developed in accordance with existing agreements between China and Nepal.

Premier Zhou Enlai made these remarks at a reception held by the Chamber of Commerce here for him and Vice Premier He Long. He added that the Chinese government and people will do their best to promote trade between the two countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. "We believe that this will not only benefit the people of our two countries, but also be conducive to peace in Asia and the world."

In his welcome speech, Chamber of Commerce Chairman Joshi praised China's achievements and its leaders, and emphasized the importance of trade between the two countries. He said that in the construction of Nepal, various organizations in Nepal, including the Chamber of Commerce, can play an equally important role. He stated that the Chamber of Commerce can only fulfill its due responsibilities in this regard when the work of exchanging urgently needed items is carried out on a larger scale and when the two countries quickly begin exchanging technical knowledge about general industries.

Earlier in the afternoon of the 27th, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their entourage visited the Nepal Museum, which houses ancient Nepalese artifacts, sculptures, manuscripts, and paintings.

That evening, the two Premiers attended a banquet held by the Indian Embassy in Nepal to celebrate India's National Day.
