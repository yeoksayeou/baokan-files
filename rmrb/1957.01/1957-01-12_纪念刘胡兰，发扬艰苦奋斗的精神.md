    The great daughter of the great Chinese Communist Party, Liu Hulan, has been dead for ten years, murdered by savage and brutal counter-revolutionary bandits. Today, her coffin will be moved to a newly built cemetery in her hometown. Comrade Mao Zedong re-inscribed the eight characters "Born Great, Died Glorious" as the inscription on the monument in her cemetery. When people mention the radiant name of Liu Hulan, they will think of the heroic girl who stood imposingly in front of the enemy's guillotine, loudly asking the enemy "How will I die?"; at the same time, they will think of the difficult environment the Party and the revolution were in at that time, and the spirit of hard struggle and self-sacrifice of the broad masses of revolutionary people and revolutionary cadres.
    In the past ten years, the revolutionary cause has advanced by leaps and bounds. Now, the Chinese people have entered a new historical era. The counter-revolutionary armed forces that killed Liu Hulan have long been wiped out on the Chinese mainland, and the system of class exploitation has basically ceased to exist. The Chinese people are bravely advancing towards the road of a prosperous and strong socialist industrial country. The great goal that Liu Hulan gave her young life to fight for is being realized step by step.
    Our country, which Liu Hulan loved, is today more vibrant, more vigorous, and more worthy of praise and love than ever before. Although there are still many difficulties and unsatisfactory things in our country, and there are still some shortcomings and errors in our work, we are constantly overcoming and changing them, and all our achievements are unprecedented in Chinese history. The great First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy is about to be completed, and the happy future of hundreds of millions of people in our country has never been so closely linked to the country's plan as it is today. No regime in Chinese history has been able to accomplish so many huge construction projects for the people in such a short period of time as today's people's democratic dictatorship.
    The glorious name and heroic image of Martyr Liu Hulan should become a great patriotic inspiration for the people of our country. It inspires the people of the whole country, especially millions of young men and women, to unyieldingly resolve to fight for the construction of a great socialist motherland.
    In order to build a great motherland, the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party advocated increasing production and practicing economy, and called on all Party members and revolutionary comrades to carry forward the glorious tradition of diligence, thrift, and hard struggle. This is of great significance for accelerating socialist accumulation, further strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. This call of the Party has been widely responded to by the people of the whole country. The broad masses of Party members and the masses are striving to increase production and practice economy from all aspects, improve efficiency, and achieve practical results step by step. However, there are also some comrades, including some comrades who bear important leadership responsibilities, who lack awareness in this regard. They demand too much to improve their own living standards, but they are relatively indifferent, or even indifferent, to the accumulation of national construction funds, the development of production, and the difficulties and demands of the people. In government offices and enterprises, they do not pay attention to careful calculation, do not save funds, do not save raw materials, increase many unnecessary non-productive expenditures, and waste the country's limited wealth.
    Many comrades should remember that in Liu Hulan's hometown and many other old revolutionary base areas, around 1947, the year Liu Hulan heroically sacrificed, when the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a civil war in an attempt to eliminate the revolutionary forces, the revolutionary comrades in the base areas endured so many hardships in order to defeat the enemy! In the most difficult times, a black bean cornbread and a potato were precious foods. Cotton clothes worn for several years were still worn as new after being sewn and washed. In the cold winter months, they found some firewood and grass to sleep on the hillside. However, at the mention of this being for the liberation of the suffering hundreds of millions of people in our country, everyone would be inspired by boiling enthusiasm for this noble and great cause, able to endure all pain, able to overcome any difficulties, and people felt that they had infinite strength. Precisely because of this, the people of the base areas depended on us for life, and they did everything possible, enduring all sacrifices to support and participate in the revolutionary struggle. This flesh-and-blood connection between the Party and the masses of the people is the fundamental guarantee of all our victories.
    Now, some of our comrades seem to have forgotten these things. They think that the revolution has been victorious, they have made contributions, and they should enjoy some blessings. Some do not want to eat ordinary meals, but want to eat very good meals; they do not want to wear ordinary clothes, but want to wear good materials; they do not want to use ordinary furniture, but want to use very good furniture. Some also want to live in good houses and ride in good cars. Some are unhappy when they see that the floor is made of cement, and must replace it with good wood or terrazzo. Some do not distinguish between public and private, and in addition to their salaries, they take advantage of the public in all aspects. As a result, their living standards are far removed from the living standards of the masses. Just think, how different is this from the life in our revolutionary base areas back then? If they are still not satisfied, what is that if not forgetting their roots? There are also some comrades who have never experienced a hard life and do not know the necessity of hard work and simple living. For these comrades, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the education of hard struggle and building the country through diligence and thrift.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On Coalition Government": "The Chinese Communists, who take the greatest interest of the broadest masses of the Chinese people as their starting point, believe that their cause is completely just, and are willing to sacrifice everything of their own, and are always ready to give their lives to our cause. Is there any thought, view, opinion, or method that is not suitable for the needs of the people that we are reluctant to discard? Do we still welcome any political dust or political microorganisms to tarnish our clean faces and erode our healthy bodies? Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the interests of the people, making each of us who are alive feel sad when we think of them. Is there any personal interest that we cannot sacrifice, and is there any mistake that we cannot abandon?" Today, on the occasion of commemorating the tenth anniversary of Liu Hulan's martyrdom, it is necessary for each of our comrades to revisit Comrade Mao Zedong's words, carefully examine their own thoughts and styles, and see if some political dust and political microorganisms have tarnished and eroded themselves, and whether they have forgotten and abandoned the glorious tradition of hard struggle, caring about the sufferings of the masses, and closely linking with the masses. The martyrs have given their most precious lives, why can't we sacrifice a little of our own material enjoyment, so that we can be closer to the masses in our lives, and at the same time save some funds for the country? If even this little thing cannot be sacrificed, then what is there to talk about the great self-sacrificing spirit of a Communist Party member?
    The socialist cause we are engaged in is the most magnificent and greatest cause in history, and it is also the ideal cause pursued by our countless revolutionary martyrs who shed blood and sacrificed themselves. Now, we have achieved many great victories on the road of socialist construction; we must continue to overcome many difficulties on the road ahead and strive for greater victories. Therefore, today, as we commemorate the tenth anniversary of Liu Hulan's martyrdom, we should promote the spirit of hard struggle and fearlessness of sacrifice tenfold and a hundredfold, work tirelessly in all positions, work diligently, and contribute all our strength to the socialist cause of our great motherland. The interests of each of us should be consistent with the interests of the socialist cause of our great motherland. We must never fail our revolutionary martyrs, and we must always be loyal to the people, loyal to the motherland, and loyal to the socialist cause.

### 纪念刘胡兰，发扬艰苦奋斗的精神

    纪念刘胡兰，发扬艰苦奋斗的精神
    伟大的中国共产党的伟大女儿刘胡兰，被野蛮残忍的反革命匪帮杀害已经十年了。今天，她的灵柩将移葬到她家乡新建的墓地。毛泽东同志重新题了“生的伟大死的光荣”八个大字，作为她的墓地的纪念碑的铭文。提起刘胡兰这个光芒万丈的名字，人们都会想到那个气势磅礴地站在敌人的铡刀面前，大声喝问敌人“我怎个死法”的英雄姑娘的形象；同时也都会想到那时候党和革命所处的艰难困苦的环境，广大革命群众和革命干部的艰苦奋斗和自我牺牲的精神。
    十年间，革命事业一日千里地向前发展，现在我国人民已经走进一个崭新的历史时代了。杀害刘胡兰的反革命武装力量早已在中国大陆上被消灭了，阶级剥削制度在基本上也已经不存在了。中国人民正在朝着一个繁荣富强的社会主义工业国的道路奋勇前进。刘胡兰付出年轻的生命所要争取的伟大目标，正在一步步实现。
    刘胡兰所热爱的我们的国家，今天比任何时候都更加充满着活力，更加生气勃勃，更加值得人们歌颂和热爱了。尽管在我们的国家，目前还有许多的困难和不能尽如人意的事情，我们的工作中还有这样或那样的一些缺点和错误，但是，我们是在不断地克服着和改变着它们，而我们的一切成就却是中国历史上从未曾有的。伟大的发展国民经济的第一个五年计划即将完成，我国数亿人民的幸福前程，从来没有像今天这样同国家的计划紧密地联结在一起。我国历史上的任何政权，都没有像今天的人民民主专政的政权能够在短短的年代里为人民办这样多的巨大的建设事业。
    刘胡兰烈士的光辉的名字和英雄的形象，应当成为我国人民的伟大的爱国主义的鼓舞力量。它鼓舞着全国人民，特别是千百万的青年男女，不屈不挠地决心为建设社会主义的伟大祖国而奋斗。
    为了建设伟大的祖国，党的八届二中全会提倡增产节约，号召全体党员和革命同志发扬勤俭朴素和艰苦奋斗的光荣传统。这对于加速社会主义积累，进一步加强党和人民群众的联系，巩固工农联盟，都有十分重大的意义。党的这一号召，得到了全国人民的广泛的响应。广大的党员和群众都在从各方面努力增产节约，提高效率，一步步地取得实效。但是也还有一些同志，包括一些负有重要领导责任的同志，在这方面还缺乏自觉。他们过多地要求提高自己的生活水平，而对于国家建设资金的积累和生产的发展，对于人民群众的困难和要求，却比较淡漠，甚至于毫不关心。他们在机关和企业中，不注意精打细算，不节约资金，不节约原材料，增加了很多不必要的非生产性开支，浪费了国家有限的财富。
    许多同志都应该记得，在刘胡兰的家乡和其他许多老革命根据地，在刘胡兰英勇牺牲的1947年前后，当国民党反动派发动内战企图消灭革命力量的时候，根据地的革命同志们为了战胜敌人，忍受过多少艰难困苦啊！在最困难的时候，一个黑豆窝窝头和一块马铃薯，都是珍贵的食品。穿过几年的棉衣，缝洗一下仍然当新的穿。严冬腊月，弄点柴草在山坡上睡觉。但是，一提到这是为了解放我国灾难深重的几万万人民，谁都会为这崇高伟大的事业而激起沸腾的热情，对一切痛苦都能忍受，对任何困难都能战胜，人们都感觉到自己有无穷的力量。也正因为这样，根据地的人民同我们相依为命，他们竭尽一切可能，忍受一切牺牲来支持和参加革命的斗争。党和人民群众之间这种血肉的联系，是我们一切胜利的根本保证。
    现在，我们有一些同志似乎忘记了这些。他们以为革命已经胜利，自己已经有功，应该享一点福了。有的普通饭不想吃，要吃很好的饭；普通衣服不想穿，要穿好料子；普通的家具不想用，要用很好的家具。也有住的要好房子，坐的要好汽车。有的看见地板是水泥的就不高兴，必须换成好木板或水磨石的。有的公私不分，薪金加上供给，从各方面沾公家的光。结果就使自己的生活水平远远地离开了人民群众的生活水平。试想一想，这和我们当年革命根据地的生活相去何止天壤？这样还不满足，那不是忘本是什么呢？还有一些同志，从来没有经历过艰苦的生活，也不知道艰苦朴素的必要。对于这些同志，需要继续加强艰苦奋斗勤俭建国的教育。
    毛泽东同志在“论联合政府”中说过：“以中国最广大人民的最大利益为出发点的中国共产党人，相信自己的事业是完全合乎正义的，不惜牺牲自己个人的一切，随时准备拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业，难道还有什么不适合人民需要的思想、观点、意见、办法，舍不得丢掉的吗？难道我们还欢迎任何政治的灰尘、政治的微生物来玷污我们的清洁的面貌和侵蚀我们的健全的肌体吗？无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”在今天纪念刘胡兰殉难十周年的时候，我们的每个同志都有必要重温一下毛泽东同志的话，好好检查一下自己的思想和作风，看是不是有些政治灰尘和政治微生物玷污和侵蚀了自己，是不是忘记了和放弃了艰苦奋斗、关心群众疾苦和密切联系群众的光荣传统。先烈们把自己的最宝贵的生命都付出来了，我们为什么不能牺牲自己一点小小的物质享受，使自己在生活上更加接近人民群众，同时为国家节省一些资金呢？如果这样一点东西也不能牺牲，那还谈什么共产党员的伟大自我牺牲精神？
    我们正在进行的社会主义事业是历史上最壮丽最伟大的事业，也是我们的无数革命先烈流血牺牲所追求的理想事业。现在，我们在社会主义建设的道路上已经获得了许多伟大的胜利；我们还必须继续克服前进道路上的许多困难，争取更大的胜利。因此，我们在纪念刘胡兰殉难十周年的今天，就应当十倍百倍地发扬艰苦奋斗不怕牺牲的精神，在一切岗位上，不懈地工作，辛勤地劳动，把自己的全部力量都贡献给我们伟大祖国的社会主义事业。我们每一个人的利益都应该同我们伟大祖国的社会主义事业的利益相一致。我们要永远不辜负我们革命的先烈，我们要永远忠于人民，忠于祖国，忠于社会主义事业。
