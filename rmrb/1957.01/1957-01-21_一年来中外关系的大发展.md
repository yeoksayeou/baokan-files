Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The past year, 1956, was a year of great development in China's friendly relations with countries around the world.

According to incomplete statistics from relevant sources, more than 5,200 foreign friends from 75 countries on five continents visited China during this year. China also accepted invitations from various countries and sent more than 5,400 people from all walks of life to 49 countries for friendly visits.

Among the foreign friends who visited China, there were various political beliefs, representing a wide range of social classes. Among them, people from culture, science, health, education, and journalism were the most numerous, with more than 2,000 people. Next were people from political circles, parliaments, religions, peace and friendship organizations, the military, and well-known social figures, totaling more than 1,000 people. There were also about 1,000 people each from trade unions, women's organizations, youth organizations, and friends from trade and business circles.

During this year, China's friendly relations with the countries of the socialist camp, centered on the Soviet Union, were further developed. In April of last year, a Soviet government delegation headed by Deputy Chairman Mikoyan visited China. From December 1955 to March 1956, a government delegation of the People's Republic of China, led by Vice Chairman Zhu De, visited seven countries including the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, and Mongolia. A government delegation of the People's Republic of China, led by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, participated in the celebration ceremony for the 35th anniversary of the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution. In November, a delegation of the National People's Congress, led by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, began a friendly visit to the Soviet Union and other countries, and this visit is still ongoing. These mutual visits between national leaders have played a significant role in consolidating and developing the fraternal friendly relations between the countries of the socialist camp. The number of people from the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries who visited China this year accounted for almost half of all foreign visitors to China this year, while the number of Chinese people who visited the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries accounted for two-fifths of all Chinese people who traveled abroad. Every mutual visit between the people of socialist countries contributes to the consolidation of the entire socialist camp.

The Chinese people are pleased to see the great development of friendly relations between China and Asian and African countries.

During this year, Indonesian leader President Sukarno, Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Laotian Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma, Nepalese Prime Minister Acharya, Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy, and Burmese Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League Chairman U Nu all visited China. At the end of last year, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long visited five countries in South Asia – Vietnam, Cambodia, India, Burma, and Pakistan. As early as December 1955 to February 1956, Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling visited India, Burma, and Pakistan. In August, Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling was invited by President Sukarno to pay a friendly visit to Indonesia. Vice Premier He Long was invited to attend the founding ceremony of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Vice Premier Ulanhu led a government delegation of the People's Republic of China to participate in the coronation ceremony of Nepalese King Mahendra.

The state visits between our national leaders and the leaders and government leaders of these countries have greatly developed and consolidated the friendly and cooperative relations between China and these countries, expanded the influence of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and made valuable contributions to the cause of world peace.

During this year, about 3,500 people from China and Asian and African countries visited each other. Among them, more than 1,200 people from Japan alone visited China. Although the Chinese people are willing to have more friendly exchanges with the Japanese people, it is regrettable that the Chinese people have not had more opportunities to visit Japan. Only a little more than 100 Chinese people visited Japan this year.

China's friendly exchanges with Latin American countries have increased significantly. This year, Chinese art troupes and people from all walks of life visited many Latin American countries and were warmly welcomed by the people of these countries. Similarly, many friends from Latin American countries who visited China this year were also warmly received by the Chinese people.

China has also sent many representatives to visit many countries in Europe, America, and Australia for friendly exchanges. However, this year, there were almost no friendly exchanges between our people and the American people, which is inseparable from the restrictions and obstacles imposed by the US authorities on friendly exchanges between the American people and the people of other countries. In order to realize the desire for free cultural and economic exchanges between the people of all countries, these artificial obstacles must be eliminated.

(Editor's note) In 1955, a total of 4,760 people from all walks of life from 63 countries came to our country to visit, lecture, study, perform, compete, hold exhibitions, and engage in other activities. This number increased by 64% compared to 1954.

At the same time, a total of 5,833 people from all aspects of our country (including duplicate figures for a small number of representatives or delegations who went to more than two countries successively) have successively visited 33 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and America for friendly visits and other economic and cultural exchanges. This number increased by two-thirds compared to 1954.

    一年来中外关系的大发展
    新华社20日讯　刚刚过去的一年——1956年，是我国同世界各国友好关系大发展的一年。
    据有关方面不完全的统计，在这一年里，约有五千二百多位外国朋友到中国来访问过，他们来自世界五大洲的七十五个国家。中国也有五千四百多各界人士接受各国的邀请，到四十九个国家进行了友好访问。
    在来华访问的各国朋友中，有着各种不同的政治信仰，代表广泛的社会阶层。其中文化、科学、卫生、教育、新闻等方面的人士最多，约有两千人以上。其次是政界、议会、宗教、和平友好、军事及著名社会人士，共有一千多人。工会、妇女、青年方面的人士和贸易、工商界方面的朋友也各有千人左右。
    在这一年里，中国同以苏联为中心的社会主义阵营各国的友好关系得到了进一步的发展。去年4月间，以米高扬副主席为首的苏联政府代表团访问了中国；1955年12月到1956年3月，由朱德副主席率领的中华人民共和国政府代表团访问了苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利和蒙古等七个国家。由李先念副总理率领的中华人民共和国政府代表团参加了蒙古人民革命胜利三十五周年庆祝典礼。11月，由彭真副委员长率领的全国人民代表大会代表团开始了对苏联等国的友好访问，现在这一访问还在继续中。国家领导人员之间的这些互相访问，对巩固和发展社会主义阵营各国的兄弟般的友好关系起了重大的作用。苏联和各人民民主国家这一年来中国访问的人几乎占这一年全部访华外宾的一半，而中国到苏联和人民民主国家访问的人也占中国出国访问全部人数的五分之二。社会主义各国人民相互进行的每一次访问都有助于整个社会主义阵营的巩固。
    中国人民高兴地看到中国同亚非各国友好关系的巨大发展。
    在这一年里，印度尼西亚人民的领袖苏加诺总统、柬埔寨王国西哈努克亲王、老挝王国首相梭发那·富马亲王、尼泊尔王国阿查里雅首相、巴基斯坦苏拉瓦底总理和缅甸联邦反法西斯人民自由同盟吴努主席都到中国来进行过访问。在去年年底的时候，周恩来总理、贺龙副总理先后访问了亚洲南部的五个国家——越南、柬埔寨、印度、缅甸和巴基斯坦。早在1955年12月到1956年2月宋庆龄副委员长先后访问了印度、缅甸和巴基斯坦三个国家；8月间，宋庆龄副委员长又应苏加诺总统的邀请，到印度尼西亚进行了友好访问。贺龙副总理应邀参加了巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国的成立典礼。乌兰夫副总理率领中华人民共和国政府代表团参加了尼泊尔国王马亨德拉的加冕典礼。
    我国国家领导人员同这些国家的领袖和政府领导人员相互进行的国事访问，大大发展和巩固了中国同这些国家的友好合作关系，扩大了和平共处五项原则的影响，对世界和平事业作出了可贵的贡献。
    这一年中，中国同亚非各国互相进行访问的人，约三千五百人左右。其中仅日本就有一千二百多人到中国进行了访问。虽然中国人民愿意同日本人民多多友好往来，但遗憾的是，中国人民却不能更多地得到访问日本的机会，这一年中国只有一百多人访问了日本。
    中国同拉丁美洲各国的友好往来有了显著的增加。这一年里，中国艺术团和各界人士访问了拉丁美洲的许多国家，受到了这些国家人民的热烈欢迎。同样，在这一年中来中国访问的拉丁美洲国家的许多朋友，也受到了中国人民的热情接待。
    中国同欧洲、美洲和澳洲的许多国家也互相派出许多代表进行友好访问。但在这一年里我国人民同美国人民几乎没有友好往来，这与美国当局对美国人民同各国人民的友好往来的限制和阻碍是分不开的。为了实现各国人民间自由地进行文化交流和经济往来的愿望，必须消除这种人为的障碍。
    （编者注）1955年内有六十三个国家的各界人士共四千七百六十人来到我国进行参观、访问、讲学、学习、表演、比赛、举办展览会以及其他各种活动。这个数字比1954年增加了64％。
    与此同时，我国各方面的人士共五千八百三十三人（包括少数代表或代表团先后去两个以上国家的重复数字在内）曾先后到过亚洲、欧洲、非洲和美洲的三十三个国家进行友好访问以及其他各种经济和文化交流。这个数目比1954年增加了三分之二。
