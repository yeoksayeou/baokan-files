Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, January 10th: The Chairman of the Presidium of the Bulgarian National Assembly, Damyanov, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Yugov, and the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the National Assembly, Kozovski, hosted a banquet in the Hall of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers on the 9th to entertain the delegation of the Chinese National People's Congress and the delegation of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, who are visiting Bulgaria.

Damyanov said in his speech at the banquet that the visit of the Chinese delegation to Bulgaria is of great benefit to both China and Bulgaria. It will help to further understand and bring closer the peoples of China and Bulgaria, and will help to further develop the political, economic and cultural ties between China and Bulgaria. Peng Zhen then spoke. He said: We were warmly welcomed by thousands upon thousands of people in Ruse, Sofia, Plovdiv, Dimitrovgrad and other places. We saw the deep fraternal friendship of the Bulgarian people towards the Chinese people, saw your internationalist feelings, and saw your high political consciousness. You are worthy of being the people of the great Dimitrov's motherland. During our short visit of more than a week, we have witnessed the development of Bulgaria's socialist undertakings in economy, culture, and various other fields. You have rapidly developed your industry. In 1955, your industrial production increased nearly five times compared to 1939. The value of industrial output has already accounted for more than 70% of the total value of industrial and agricultural output. Your country has been industrialized. The male and female workers we saw in various factories were full of energy, worked actively, and were very happy. We visited your countryside, saw your cooperative and mechanized agriculture, learned about the production and operation of agricultural cooperatives, visited the families of your farmers, and also visited your handicraft cooperatives. We personally saw that the lives of Bulgarian farmers and handicraft workers have been greatly improved since liberation. Your construction achievements are brilliant. You have many advanced experiences worth learning from.

After Peng Zhen finished speaking, he and the foreign envoys to Bulgaria present at the banquet clinked glasses one by one, congratulating the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and congratulating the unity of all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world.

After the banquet, the guests and hosts also held hands and danced a collective dance in the hall.

The delegation returned to Sofia from Dimitrovgrad by special train on the afternoon of the 8th. During their visit to Dimitrovgrad, they visited some factories and the Municipal People's Congress separately.
