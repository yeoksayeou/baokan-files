Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, January 9th: The broad masses of young people in Shanxi Province have received an education in revolutionary traditions through studying the life and deeds of the revolutionary heroine Liu Hulan.

In the past half month, about 80% of young people in the four cities of Taiyuan, Datong, and Yangquan have listened to reports on Liu Hulan's life and deeds. The Communist Youth League organizations in more than ten counties, including Jiexiu, dispatched a large number of cadres to the countryside to report to rural youth about Liu Hulan's noble qualities of loving the motherland and being loyal to the revolution. Young people in the vicinity of Yunzhou West Village, Wenshui County, also sent representatives to Liu Hulan's home to ask her mother, Hu Wenxiu, about stories from Liu Hulan's life.

The newly reprinted 55,000 copies of "A Brief Biography of Liu Hulan" have been snapped up by young people, and many young people have asked Xinhua Bookstore to continue supplying books about Liu Hulan's life and deeds. The articles serialized in the "Shanxi Daily" and "Shanxi Youth Daily" about Liu Hulan's life stories have become the most beloved reading material for young people.

After studying Liu Hulan's life and deeds, the young female workers of the Jinsheng Textile Factory in Taiyuan and the Jinhua Textile Factory in Yuci expressed their determination to overcome the phenomenon of not paying attention to saving raw materials in production, and resolved to strive to be advanced producers in increasing production and practicing economy. The students of Class 16 of Datong Normal School were not united enough in the past. After studying Liu Hulan's revolutionary deeds, they automatically organized mutual aid groups for the two courses of physics and geometry to help students with weaker comprehension abilities. Students of Yuci County No. 1 Middle School also launched a meaningful activity of "Symbolic Long-Distance Running Training from Yuci to Yunzhou West Village." More than 3,000 young people in Yunzhou West Village, Wenshui County, and other places organized 39 study groups to learn Liu Hulan's noble qualities of loving the motherland, and also launched a manure accumulation campaign. After studying and discussing Liu Hulan's life and deeds, 637 young people and children in Chixia Township, Lingchuan County, are building a new "Liu Hulan Canal" next to the village as a sacrifice to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Liu Hulan's martyrdom. This canal will be completed before January 12 and will be able to irrigate 700 mu of farmland.

    山西青年学习刘胡兰的英雄事迹
    努力增产节约加强学习锻炼
    新华社太原9日电　山西省广大青年在学习革命女英雄刘胡兰的生平事迹中，受到一次革命传统的教育。
    近半个月以来，太原、大同、阳泉等四个市已经有80％左右的青年听了有关刘胡兰生平事迹的报告。解虞等十多个县的青年团组织派出大批干部到乡下去，向农村青年报告刘胡兰热爱祖国、忠于革命的高贵品质的事迹。文水县云周西村附近地区的青年们也派代表到刘胡兰家中，请她母亲胡文秀讲了关于刘胡兰生前的故事。
    新近再版的五万五千册“刘胡兰小传”已经被青年们争购一空，许多青年要求新华书店继续供应有关刘胡兰生平事迹的书籍。“山西日报”和“山西青年报”连载的刘胡兰生平故事等文章，成了青年们最喜爱的读物。
    太原晋生纺织厂和榆次晋华纺织厂的青年女工们，在学习了刘胡兰的生平事迹以后，表示决心克服生产上不注意节约原材料的现象，决心要在增产节约中争取作个先进生产者。大同师范学校十六班的学生过去不够团结，在学习了刘胡兰的革命事迹以后，他们自动组织了物理学和几何两门课程的互助组，帮助理解能力较差的同学。榆次县第一中学学生还开展了“榆次到云周西村象征长跑锻炼”的有意义的活动。文水县云周西村等地的三千多名青年组织了三十九个学习小组，学习刘胡兰热爱祖国的高贵品质，并且开展了积肥活动。陵川县池下乡六百三十七个青年和少年，在学习和讨论了刘胡兰的生平事迹以后，正在村边新修一条“刘胡兰渠”，作为纪念刘胡兰就义十周年的祭礼。这条渠将在1月12日前完工，它将能灌溉七百亩农田。
