Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 3rd: Premier Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam stated on January 2nd at the Sixth Session of the Vietnamese National Assembly that the strength of the Vietnamese people has greatly increased since the restoration of peace. However, at the same time, American imperialism is increasingly intensifying its interference in South Vietnam. He said that the strength of our people's unity and struggle has defeated the French colonialists. However, the United States has now effectively occupied our country's south. Our people must continue the revolutionary struggle against American imperialism, just as we previously conducted the revolutionary struggle against the French colonialists.

Pham Van Dong delivered a report on the government's work at the morning and afternoon sessions of the assembly on January 2nd. This report, which exceeds 30,000 words, thoroughly analyzed the international situation and Vietnam's foreign policy, and also discussed the issue of unification struggle, the consolidation of North Vietnam, and a general assessment of the current situation in North Vietnam.

Strengthen Unity, Consolidate Peace, and Realize National Unification

Pham Van Dong said that facing the crisis of long-term national division caused by the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, and the vicious and barbaric means they have adopted, our compatriots of all strata, classes, parties, religions, and ethnicities must unite even more closely and broadly, and resolutely and methodically carry out the struggle to consolidate peace and realize national unification.

Pham Van Dong also said that we must consolidate North Vietnam in all aspects, while also striving for South Vietnam. Consolidating North Vietnam plays a very important role and significance in the complex, long-term, and arduous struggle to unify the country. North Vietnam is the pillar, foundation, and main force of this struggle.

He said that at the same time, in order to create favorable conditions for the unified country, we must strengthen the struggle aimed at restoring and developing normal relations in all aspects between North Vietnam and South Vietnam, and then achieving contact between the two regions.

The Geneva Accords are a good basis for our struggle to consolidate peace and achieve unification. We must continue to uphold the legal basis of the Geneva Accords.

For two years, the International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission has contributed to the implementation of the Geneva Accords and the maintenance of peace in Vietnam. We welcome the activities of the International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission and constantly cooperate with and assist it. At the same time, we hope that the International Commission will continue to carry out its mission and ensure that all parties concerned strictly fulfill the Geneva Accords.

Pham Van Dong emphasized that the Vietnamese people's struggle to unify their motherland is a revolutionary struggle, a long-term and arduous struggle, but it will surely be victorious.

Speaking of Vietnam's foreign policy, Pham Van Dong said: The key to our foreign policy is to continuously and more closely strengthen Vietnam's relations with socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union and China. This relation must be based on the principles of complete equality, respect for territorial integrity, national sovereignty, national independence, and non-interference in internal affairs; these principles have been pointed out in the Soviet government's statement of October 30, 1956, the Chinese government's statement of November 1, 1956, and the Vietnamese government's statement of November 6, 1956. He said: Vietnam's friendship with socialist and people's democratic countries is a powerful guarantee for Vietnam's independence and prosperity, and for the Vietnamese people's struggle to consolidate peace and achieve unification.

Pham Van Dong said that at present, we are beginning to establish diplomatic and economic relations with some Southeast Asian countries. We hope to develop friendly and cooperative relations with all countries in Asia on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Domestic Economic Situation

Premier Pham Van Dong spoke about the achievements the government has made in consolidating North Vietnam. He said that the anti-feudal task in the North has been basically completed. He also pointed out that after the Party and the government began to correct the mistakes made in the land reform, the situation in the countryside has stabilized. Originally, there were saboteurs and reactionary elements disguised as religious figures carrying out sabotage activities in the countryside, but the atmosphere has now changed. This year's bumper autumn rice harvest has also helped stabilize the countryside.

In terms of healing the wounds of war, the North has restored 115,000 hectares of wasteland, accounting for 85% of all abandoned land. Large-scale water conservancy projects that were destroyed have been repaired, and small and medium-sized water conservancy projects have been built. In 1956, rice production reached 4,132,000 tons, exceeding the highest pre-war annual output. In addition to grain, economic crops, animal husbandry, forestry, and fishery have all been restored; all except fishery have exceeded pre-war levels.

In terms of industry, the ten large enterprises taken over, such as the Hon Gai coal mine and the Nam Dinh textile factory, have been restored. The eighteen factories developed during the resistance war have been maintained and consolidated. At the same time, some factories and enterprises are being built, of which seven have been completed, six are nearing completion, and five are under construction. The output value of state-owned industry in 1955 was 18 billion VND, accounting for 20% of the total industrial output value; in 1956, it increased to 130 billion VND, accounting for 45% of the total industrial output value. The output value of private industry and handicrafts in 1956 was 165 billion VND, double that of 1955.

Of the more than 1,000 kilometers of railway destroyed in the North, 526 kilometers have been repaired. 3,800 kilometers of highways have been restored, and 201 kilometers have been newly built. In addition, waterways and sea routes have been dredged, and airports have been repaired. State-owned transport capacity in 1956 doubled that of 1955. Telephone lines have been extended by 10,000 kilometers. Commerce has developed rapidly in the past two years. State-owned commerce has maintained its leading position. By the end of 1956, there were ten specialized trading companies, and domestic turnover increased sevenfold compared with 1955. Supply and marketing cooperatives have been established in twenty-one provinces and cities, with one million members, supplying goods to four million people, accounting for 5% of market retail sales. Trade between urban and rural areas, between plains and mountainous areas, and foreign trade have all developed.

1957 Financial and Economic Guidelines

Speaking of the financial situation, Pham Van Dong said that income in 1956 increased by 34% compared with 1955, with the income of state-owned enterprises accounting for the main part. In the 1956 expenditures, nearly two-thirds was used for economic construction and cultural development. The State Bank issued 276 billion VND in loans to develop economic construction.

Pham Van Dong pointed out that the lives of the farmers and mountain people, who account for the majority of the population, have been improved to a certain extent in the past two years. Other classes of people still have some difficulties, but their lives will definitely be gradually improved.

Pham Van Dong said that the financial and economic guidelines for 1957 will be to continue to restore and develop the production of agriculture and light industry, consolidate and develop the state-owned economy, continue to develop all the capabilities of handicrafts, and give play to the initiative of private industry and commerce. Pham Van Dong pointed out that the policy of financial work in 1957 must focus on self-reliance and promoting production, and at the same time must reflect the policy of consolidating the North and striving for the South.

Speaking of the achievements made in education, Pham Van Dong said that in the past two years, another 730,000 people have been made literate. At this rate of progress, illiteracy in the North can be eliminated in three years. To date, there are 5,046 schools with 950,000 students, which is double that of 1939, while the number of middle school students has increased sevenfold, and the number of university students has increased threefold. Great achievements have also been made in disease prevention and health campaigns and in raising the cultural life of the people.

Internal Affairs

When talking about internal affairs, Pham Van Dong emphasized the need to strengthen the unity of the whole people, and at present to pay attention to expanding democracy while strengthening dictatorship, so as to ensure the development of the people's democratic system and make it steadily move towards socialism. He said that at the same time, it is necessary to strengthen national defense to guard against the aggressive conspiracies of imperialism and its running dogs.

Pham Van Dong said that from the government's entire work in the past two years, we can clearly see that we have achieved many achievements (some of which are major achievements), which is fundamental. At the same time, we have also made some mistakes and shortcomings, including the mistakes made in the land reform. After discovering the errors and shortcomings, the government has studied them and corrected them.

Pham Van Dong said that the legacy of the colonialist system and the feudalist system, as well as the consequences of fifteen years of war, still leave a painful mark on our economy, in our country, in our lives, and in our minds. We are determined to remove this mark, build a new economy, culture and a new life, and change the face of our country. We will definitely be able to realize such a task. Pham Van Dong finally said that in order to strive for new victories, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the government, and President Ho Chi Minh, our people must unite more closely, fight more resolutely, expand achievements, correct mistakes and shortcomings, overcome difficulties, and promote all work, so as to consolidate North Vietnam and strive for the South, strengthen the force for national unification, and contribute to defending world peace.

    在越南国民大会第六次会议上
    范文同总理作关于政府工作的报告
    新华社河内3日电　越南民主共和国总理范文同1月2日在越南国民大会第六次会议上说：和平恢复以来，越南人民的力量已经大大成长起来了。但是，在这同时，美帝国主义日益加强对南越的干涉。他说，我们人民团结和斗争的力量，已经打败了法国殖民者。但是，美国目前实际上已经占领我国南方，我们人民必须继续进行反对美帝国主义的革命斗争，如同过去我们曾经进行反对法国殖民者的革命斗争一样。
    范文同2日在大会上午和下午的会议上作关于政府工作的报告。这个长达三万多字的报告详细地分析了国际形势和越南的外交政策，并且谈到统一斗争的问题、巩固越南北方的问题和对当前越南北方情况总的估计等。
    加强团结，巩固和平，实现国家的统一
    范文同说，面临着由美国及吴庭艳集团所造成的国家长期分割的危机和他们采取的恶毒野蛮的手段，我们各阶层、各阶级、党派、宗教、民族的同胞们都必须更加紧密和广泛的团结，坚决地有步骤地进行斗争，来巩固和平，实现国家的统一。
    范文同又说，我们必须在各方面巩固越南北方，同时要争取越南南方。巩固越南北方对统一国家的复杂的、长期的、艰苦的斗争有着十分巨大的作用和意义。越南北方是这个斗争的支柱、基础和主要力量。
    他说，同时，为了为统一国家创造顺利的条件，我们要加强目的在恢复和发展越南北方和越南南方之间在各方面的正常关系的斗争，进而达到两个地区之间的接触。
      日内瓦协议是我们巩固和平、实现统一的斗争的良好依据。我们必须继续维护日内瓦协议的法理基础。
    两年来，国际监督和监察委员会对履行日内瓦协议和维护越南的和平作出了贡献。我们欢迎国际监督和监察委员会的活动，不断地与它合作，帮助它。同时，我们希望国际委员会继续执行它的任务，保证有关各方必须严格履行日内瓦协议。
    范文同强调说，越南人民统一自己祖国的斗争，是一个革命的斗争，是长期艰苦的斗争，但是它一定会获得胜利。
    在谈到越南的外交政策的时候，范文同说：我们的对外政策的关键，是不断地和更紧密地加强越南同社会主义各国、尤其是苏联和中国的关系。这个关系必须以完全平等、尊重领土完整、国家主权、民族独立、互不干涉内政等原则为基础；这些原则已经在苏联政府的1956年10月30日声明、中国政府的1956年11月1日声明和越南政府的1956年11月6日声明中指出了。他说：越南同社会主义和人民民主国家的友谊，对越南的独立和繁荣、对越南人民为巩固和平、实现统一的斗争是一个有力的保证。
    范文同说，在目前，我们开始同东南亚一些国家建立外交和经济关系。我们希望在和平共处五项原则上，同亚洲所有国家发展友好合作的关系。
    国内经济情况
    范文同总理谈到政府在巩固越南北方的工作中所取得的成绩。他说，反封建的任务在北方已经基本上完成，他并且指出，在党和政府开始纠正在土地改革中所犯的错误以后，农村中的情况已经稳定下来。原来在农村有破坏分子和披着宗教外衣的反动分子进行破坏活动，但是目前的气氛已经转变。今年秋稻的丰收也有助于农村的稳定。
    在医治战争创伤方面，北方已经恢复了十一万五千公顷的荒地，占全部抛荒土地的85％。修复了被破坏的大型水利工程和兴修了中小型水利工程。1956年稻米产量达到四百十三万二千吨，超过战前的最高年产量。除了粮食以外，经济作物、畜牧业、林业和渔业都得到恢复；除渔业以外，都超过了战前的水平。
    工业方面，接收下来的十项大的企业如鸿基煤矿、南定纱厂等都得到恢复。在抗战中发展的十八个工厂都得到维持和巩固。同时，正在兴建一些工厂企业，其中有七个已经完成，六个接近完成，五个正在修建。国营工业的产值在1955年是一百八十亿元（越币），占工业总产值的20％；1956年增加到一千三百亿元（越币），占工业总产值的45％。私营工业和手工业的产值在1956年为一千六百五十亿元（越币），比1955年增加一倍。
    在北方被破坏的一千多公里的铁路中，已经修复了五百二十六公里。公路恢复了三千八百公里，新修了二百零一公里。另外还疏浚了水路、海路，修理了飞机场。国营运输力1956年比1955年增加了一倍。电话线扩展了一万公里。商业两年来有迅速的发展。国营商业保持了领导地位，到1956年底，已经有十个专业贸易公司，国内营业额比1955年增加七倍。供销合作社已经在二十一个省、市建立起来，有一百万社员，为四百万人供应货物，占市场零售额的5％。城乡之间，平原与山区之间的贸易以及对外贸易，都有了发展。
    1957年财经方针
    在谈到财政情况的时候，范文同说，1956年的收入比1955年增加34％，其中国营企业的收入占主要的地位。在1956年的支出中，用于经济建设和发展文化的经费占近三分之二。国家银行为了发展经济建设，发放了两千七百六十亿元（越币）的贷款。
    范文同指出，两年来占人口大多数的农民和山区人民的生活，已经得到一定程度的改善。其他阶层人民还存在一些困难，但是他们的生活一定将会逐步得到改善。
    范文同谈到1957年的财政经济方针将是继续恢复和发展农业和轻工业的生产，巩固和发展国营经济，继续发挥手工业的一切能力和发挥私营工商业的积极性。范文同指出，1957年的财政工作的政策必须以自力更生和推进生产为主，同时必须体现巩固北方、争取南方的方针。
    谈到在教育方面取得的成绩时，范文同说，在过去两年中又扫除了文盲七十三万人，以这样的进展将可以在三年中扫清北方的文盲。到目前为止，已经有五千零四十六所学校，九十五万学生，这比1939年增加两倍，而中学生则增加七倍，大学生增加三倍。在防病卫生运动和提高人民的文化生活等方面，也取得了很大的成绩。
    内政问题
    范文同在谈到内政问题的时候，强调要加强全民的团结，在目前注意扩大民主的同时加强专政，以保证人民民主制度的发展，并且使它稳步地走向社会主义。他说，同时要加强国防，以防备帝国主义及其走狗的侵略阴谋。
    范文同说，从政府两年来的全部工作来看，我们清楚地看到了我们已经取得了许多成绩（其中有一些重大的成绩），这是基本的。同时，我们也犯了一些错误和缺点，其中有在土地改革中犯的错误。在发现错误和缺点以后，政府已经研究了这些错误和缺点，并且进行了纠正。
    范文同说，殖民主义制度和封建主义制度以及十五年战争所遗留下来的后果，在我们的经济中、在我们国家中、在我们生活中、在我们思想中，还留有一个沉痛的痕迹。我们决心去掉这个痕迹，建设新的经济、文化和新的生活，改变我们国家的面貌，我们将一定能够实现这样的任务。范文同最后说，为了争取新的胜利，在越南劳动党、政府和胡志明主席的领导下，我们人民要更加紧密团结，更加坚决斗争，扩大成绩，纠正错误和缺点，克服困难，推进全部工作，以巩固越南北方和争取南方，加强争取国家统一的力量，为保卫世界和平作出贡献。
