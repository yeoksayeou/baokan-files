    Tomorrow's Grassland
    The snow fell heavier and heavier. At first, the road was slippery, then gradually turned white. It was unclear whether the snow had attracted the wind, or the wind had caught up with the snow. In an instant, one couldn't distinguish between the snow falling from the sky and the snow swirling from the ground. Heaven and earth blended into one color, a vast expanse of white. Looking down, one couldn't see the road; looking up, one couldn't see the houses. One could only feel the wind and snow battering one's face, and the whirlwind roaring like a million soldiers and horses galloping. It was in these days that the track-laying workers of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, carrying sleepers and pulling steel rails, were laying the Baotou-Baiyun Obo Railway towards its final station.
    For the first time, the train's whistle sounded long and clear on the Ulanqab League grassland, and the locomotive's smoke rose for the first time over Baiyun Obo, the future mining city. The herdsmen living in yurts couldn't stay at home. They rode their steeds to see the "iron oxen" they had longed for. They raised their thumbs and affectionately shouted, "Ma Nai (Our) Ministry of Railways! Ma Nai Ministry of Railways!" The staff and workers fighting in the "mining city," dressed in festive attire, and accompanied by Bayanduleng, the director of the Ulanqab League office, braved the wind and snow to present banners to the railway workers. As soon as everyone met, they shook hands and embraced tightly. As soon as everyone spoke, they talked about the grassland's tomorrow. A comrade from Baotou Steel said to the railway workers, "When the ore is transported into the factory, when the ore is sent into the blast furnace, when the iron sand becomes steel, when the steel becomes tractors galloping on the fields... people will remember you..."
    A comrade also read a letter from the No. 541 Exploration Team to the railway workers: "The train's whistle has sounded, the locomotive's smoke has risen, Baiyun Obo is more closely connected with all parts of the motherland. This is a historical commemoration, a great transformation of the grassland..." As soon as everyone talked about the grassland's tomorrow, they forgot the frightening wind and snow before them.

    明天的草原
    雪越下越大，路开始是滑，后来渐渐发白。不知是雪招来了风，还是风赶上了雪，刹那间，分不出哪是从空中落下的雪，哪是从地上卷起的雪，天地混成一色，眼前白茫茫一片，低头不见道路，抬头不见房舍，只感到风雪扑打着脸，旋风像千军万马在奔腾地吼叫。就在这种日子里，铁道部第三工程局的钉道工人，扛着枕木，拉着钢轨，让包（头）白（云鄂博）路铺向最后一个车站。
    火车的汽笛第一次在乌兰察布盟草原上长鸣，机车的烟雾第一次在未来的矿工城——白云鄂博升起。住在蒙古包里的牧民，谁也在家里呆不住，骑上骏马，去看久已热望的“铁牤牛”。他们举起大拇指，亲切地喊着“马乃（我们的）铁道部！马乃铁道部！”战斗在“矿工城”里的职工们，穿着节日服装，和乌盟办事处主任巴彦都荣等结伙作伴地冒着风雪去给铁路职工赠送锦旗。大伙儿一见面，就紧紧地握手和拥抱，大伙儿一开口，就讲草原的明天。包钢的一位同志对铁路职工说：“当矿砂运进工厂，当矿石送进高炉，当铁砂变成钢，当钢材变成拖拉机奔驰在原野上……，人们会记起你们……”
    有位同志还念了五四一勘探队写给铁路职工的一封信：“火车的汽笛响了，机车的烟雾升起来了，白云鄂博与祖国各地更密切的联接起来了，这是历史上的纪念，草原的大转变……”大伙儿一谈到明天的草原，就忘了眼前这怕人的风雪。
