The People and the Army as One Family

A certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in a certain county in the Tianjin Special District of Hebei Province has developed a deep friendship with the local people. The masses treated the soldiers like their own children, offering their houses for the troops to live in, and washing and mending clothes for the soldiers. The officers and soldiers, adhering to the glorious tradition of the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" and "Supporting the Government and Cherishing the People," launched a campaign to love the people. They used their own money to buy new agricultural tools and gave them to the farmers to support collectivization, and often took the time to help with spring plowing, sowing, and autumn harvesting. When floods struck in the summer, the officers and soldiers went in entire battalions and regiments to help the farmers day and night to rescue and protect the crops. Therefore, the farmers in the area all said: The army and we are one family; they are not only the defenders of the country, but also the most understanding helpers of our agricultural cooperative.

    A certain tank regiment actively helps the tractor station repair and assemble tractor parts. As spring plowing approached, the regiment's repair company commander and mechanics came to the station again to help inspect and repair the tractors.
    After the farmers suffered from floods, the People's Liberation Army soldiers practiced strict economy, saving one or two liang of rice per person per day. Now, they have handed over 10,000 jin of saved grain to the county grain bureau to support the people affected by the disaster.
    The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are exceptionally concerned about the lives of the people. They often visit the members of agricultural cooperatives near their station during holidays. Second Lieutenant Zhang Xuecheng and Private Huo Zhanshan are as close to cooperative members Grandpa Qiao and Grandma Dong as if they were family.
    In order to vigorously support agricultural production, a certain detachment of a certain unit sent 110 cartloads of manure (totaling 220,000 jin) to the agricultural cooperative. The picture shows the unit's carts fully loaded with manure heading to the cooperative's fields.
    Last spring, the local garrison sent a large number of books and a radio to the agricultural cooperative, and sent people to help establish a club. Now, more books have been sent.
    Before the Spring Festival, students came to visit and tour the troops stationed in the area. This is a gunner from a certain artillery unit explaining the power of artillery shells to visiting students.
    In January, a certain unit established discipline inspection teams in its subordinate units to go deep into the masses to inspect the troops' mass discipline and solicit opinions from the people about the troops. The picture shows the artillery regiment's inspection team compensating and apologizing to Aunt Su after discovering that a soldier had borrowed Aunt Su's basket and lost it.
    The army and the people celebrate the arrival of the Spring Festival together.
    Soldier Huang Jun carried water to the home of Zhang Fengqi, a military family member. Aunt Zhang said happily, "Child! You've worked hard."
    Before the Spring Festival, officers and soldiers wrote a large number of letters of condolence to the local government and the masses, thanking the Party, the People's Government, and the masses for their support and assistance.
    Before the Spring Festival, the 3rd Company of a certain unit conducted education on supporting the government and cherishing the people for all soldiers. The picture shows Instructor Yang Changwei giving soldiers a political lesson on the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army and the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention.
    Soldiers put up Spring Festival couplets for the agricultural cooperative and celebrate the Spring Festival together.

    军民一家
    驻在河北省天津专区某县的中国人民解放军某部队同当地群众发展了深厚的友谊。群众像对待自己的子弟一样让房子给部队住，给士兵们洗衣服缝衣服。官兵们本着“三大纪律八项注意”和“拥政爱民”的光荣传统展开了爱民工作。他们用自己的钱买了新式农具赠给农民支援合作化，并经常抽出人来帮助春耕、播种和秋收。当夏天洪水袭来的时候，官兵们整营整团的去帮助农民日夜抢险保庄稼。因此，该地的农民都说：军队和咱们是一家人，他们不但是国家的保卫者，而且也是我们农业社最知己的帮手。　野雨、高粮摄影
