The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Health Department recently convened its affiliated medical units to discuss how to promote the medical heritage of minority nationalities and how to attach importance to the work of national doctors.

National medicine has historically played a significant role in protecting the health of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. National doctors, scattered in various cities, towns, and villages, remain an important medical force. According to preliminary statistics, there are more than 350 national doctors in southern Xinjiang alone, and they have a broad mass base and prestige in medical treatment. However, some health workers, without conducting in-depth investigations and research, have adopted an attitude of negating them altogether. Furthermore, they have not taken active measures in organizational leadership and taxation to assist them in carrying out their work, thus limiting the health care work for all ethnic groups. In order to overcome these shortcomings and to have a clear understanding of leading the work of national doctors, the Autonomous Region Health Department organized investigation teams in July and August last year to conduct in-depth investigations in Hotan, Keriya, Chira, Lop, Karakax, and Pishan counties, where there are more national doctors. They gained a thorough understanding of the medical foundation, medication, medical treatment, and requirements of the national doctors.

During this discussion, the participants analyzed the investigation report in conjunction with specific facts and unanimously agreed that national medicine is an integral part of the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine, and affirmed the medical effects of national doctors. Therefore, they suggested that the health department should promptly take measures to promote the medical heritage of national minorities. (Wu Zhifu)

    新疆维吾尔自治区卫生部门
    研究发扬民族医学遗产问题
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区卫生厅最近召集所属医疗单位，讨论怎样发扬少数民族医学遗产和重视民族医工作的问题。
    民族医在历史上对保护新疆各族人民健康起过很大的作用。现在分散在各个城市、集镇和乡村中的民族医，仍然是一支重要的医疗力量。据初步统计，南疆就有民族医三百五十余人，他们在医疗上有广泛的群众基础和威信。但是，一部分卫生工作人员没有进行深入的调查研究，就采取了一概抹煞的态度；在组织领导和税收上，也没有采取积极措施协助他们开展业务，因而使各族人民的保健工作受到限制。自治区卫生厅为了克服这些缺点、心中有数地领导民族医工作，于去年七、八月间，组织调查组深入民族医较多的和阗、于阗、策勒、洛浦、墨玉和皮山等六个县进行调查，对民族医的医学基础、用药、医疗情况以及民族医的要求等，都摸了底。
    在这次讨论中，根据调查报告结合具体事实进行分析，参加讨论的人一致认为民族医学是祖国医学遗产的组成部分，并肯定了民族医的医疗效果。因此，他们建议卫生部门迅速采取措施，发扬民族医学遗产。　（吴稚甫）
