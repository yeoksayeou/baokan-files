    On Bearing Responsibility for One's Writing
    Dai Fang
      The old saying "bear responsibility for one's writing," known to all, seems to have become an empty phrase in recent years. In reality, not only are many well-reasoned and justified articles unable to be published, but even if they are lucky enough to be published, they are often revised and revised again, to the point of being completely unrecognizable. Under such strict rules and regulations, it is indeed quite difficult to write articles with independent thinking and a unique style.
    I ask, is it that authors are unwilling to take responsibility for their own articles? If you ask the author, the answer will definitely be no. Is it that the comrades engaged in editing work "like to be teachers," or truly have a sense of authority, and think that other people's articles are all no good, and must use their own axe to hack away at them? I think that there are not too many fools in the world who like to do thankless tasks, or who bring rocks to hit their own feet. Then, who should be responsible for this situation that prevents authors from bearing responsibility for their writing? The answer is simple, and the following complaint from an editor comrade can serve as an explanation:
      "As soon as a magazine or a couple of issues of a weekly are published, the editorial department will receive phone calls like these: Why does a certain article only talk about ideology and not about artistry? This is vulgar sociology! Why does a certain article only talk about artistry and not about ideology? This is formalism, a manifestation of art for art's sake! Some even go so far as to say: Shouldn't your editorial department conduct a self-criticism this time? As far as I know, you have always lacked the spirit of self-criticism. You must study hard!"
    Thus, such phenomena arise: everyone only says what everyone else is saying, trying to write articles that are all-encompassing and well-balanced, one could even say taking every step carefully, leaving no room for attack. And the editing comrades will also follow this principle to make demands on the authors, such as, this point is not enough, that point should be supplemented, etc., their purpose is only to achieve a well-balanced, impregnable state. Otherwise, some clever authors will also have other ways: that is, to copy a passage from Belinsky's or Chernyshevsky's essays in advance as a framework, and then use Chinese literary works as material to fill in this framework to prove the correctness of their argument. Of course, this is as "safe" as it gets, and at the same time, conceptualized and formulaic articles are thus completed.
    In addition, some older generation gentlemen who are not yet good at using Marxist phrases can only remain silent in front of Belinsky, Chernyshevsky, etc., or simply copy their research insights on the top of the book, letting it become a lost art. Otherwise, they would recognize that they "only eat interest and never want to increase the principal." That is to say, they believe that their current reputation in academia was established in the past, and if they no longer write articles, they can treat it as capital to earn interest from. If they write again, once they are criticized, even the previous capital will be gone. Naturally, it is better not to write. Of course, these strange ideas should be examined from two aspects – that is, the views of the criticized and the views of those who look at the criticized; is it that once criticized, everything is wrong and nothing is right? Or is it that only a little bit has collapsed and it does not affect the overall situation? Or is there still room to fight back?
    From the above reasons, according to the principle of "bearing responsibility for one's writing," can the comrades of the editorial department purely objectively publish other people's articles, without bearing any responsibility themselves? No, according to my personal opinion, it cannot be so simple. For example, errors in the understanding of political issues – such as saying that the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom peasant revolution was a democratic revolution led by the bourgeoisie – and errors in the quotation of materials, the editorial department must still raise these to the author. Everything else should be the responsibility of the author himself.
    Yes, the time has come, under the principle of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," we can all be bolder, and let authors have the right to bear responsibility for their writing! Otherwise, everyone will not be able to speak up, or will speak up weakly!

    谈文责自负
    戴舫
      “文责自负”，这句尽人皆知的老话，近些年来似乎已成虚语了。实际上是不仅某些持之有故、言之成理的文章很多都发表不出来，有时纵然幸而发表了，也会被改之又改，以至被改得面目全非。要在这样清规戒律极其严密的情况之下，写出有独立思考、独特风格的文章来，确实是件颇不容易的事情。
    试问，是不是作者不愿负自己文章的责任呢？如果你去问作者，那回答一定是否定的。是不是搞编辑工作的同志们“好为人师”，或者真正有权威感，认为别人的文章全都不行，非得用自己的斧头来大砍一阵不可呢？依笔者想，像这样喜欢做吃力不讨好，或者运石头来打自己的脚的笨伯，在普天下也不会是太多的。那吗，这种使作者不能自负其文责的责任又应当谁负呢？回答很简单，有下面的某一位编辑同志的牢骚可作为一个说明：
      “一本杂志或某两期周刊出版了，不两天编辑部就会接到这样的一些电话：某某文章为什么只谈思想性而不谈艺术性呢？这是庸俗社会学！某某文章为什么只谈艺术性而不谈思想性呢？这是形式主义、艺术至上主义的表现！甚而至于说：你们编辑部这回总应该检讨了吧！据我了解，你们一向都是缺乏自我批评的精神的。你们得好好的学习呀！”
    于是这样一些现象便随之而生了：大家都只说人云亦云的话，尽量将文章写得面面俱到，四平八稳，简直可以说步步为营，无隙可击。而编辑同志也会本此原则去向作者提出要求，如你这点不够，那点还应当补充等等，其目的亦不过想达到四平八稳，无隙可击的境地而已。再不然，某一些聪明的作者也会另有办法：即预先从别林斯基或车尔尼雪夫斯基的论文中抄录下一段话来作为框子，然后再将中国文学作品作为材料，向这个框子填了进去，以证明他立论的正确。当然，这是再“安全”不过的了，而同时，概念化、公式化的文章也于是乎告成。
    此外是某一些尚不善于运用马克思主义辞句的老一代的先生们，便只有在别林斯基、车尔尼雪夫斯基等的面前，默尔而息，或者干脆只将自己研究的心得抄写在书顶上面，让它成为绝学。再不然，就是自认“只吃利钱而决不想增加本钱”。这就是说，他认为他此刻在学术界的一点声望还是以前建立起来的，如果不再写文章的话，就可以当作本钱来生利吃下去。如果再写呢，一旦受到批评，那连以前的本钱也会没有了。自然以不写为佳。当然，这些奇异的想法是应该从两方面来检查的，——那就是被批评者与看待被批评者的人的看法问题；是不是一被批评就全部皆非，百无一可呢？或者是只垮了一点而尚不至影响全局？或者是还有还手的余地？
    从以上的一些理由，如果用“文责自负”的原则看来，编辑部的同志们是不是就可以纯客观主义地来只发表别人的文章，而自己并不负任何责任了呢？不，依笔者个人管见，也并不能如此简单。比如关于政治问题理解的错误，——如将太平天国农民革命说成是资产阶级领导的民主革命，——以及引用材料的错误之类，编辑部仍旧非向作者提出不可的。其他的都应该由作者自己负责。
    是的，是时候了，在“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的原则之下，我们都可以大胆一些了，让作者得有权利去自负文责吧！不然，大家想鸣也鸣不起来，或者鸣也会鸣得有气无力！
