Xinhua News Agency, January 5th – The inspection work of the National People's Congress deputies and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in various regions has concluded.

The deputies and members conducted inspections in twenty-two provinces, two autonomous regions, and three municipalities directly under the central government. Many elderly deputies and members also went deep among the masses to conduct visits, some extensively established contacts with people from all walks of life, and received visiting masses. After the conclusion of their inspections, most of them properly handled and explained the opinions and requests raised by the masses on the spot. When Wang Zhishen and other deputies inspected Shanghai, they got up at three o'clock in the morning to go to the market to inspect the vegetable trade in the free market under state leadership. Liang Sicheng, a deputy in Shenyang, was hospitalized due to physical discomfort, but he began his inspection before his health was fully restored. During the inspections, many deputies and members often repeatedly checked, analyzed, and studied the information they learned. When Xu Baoju, a deputy, inspected Jianye District in Nanjing, he heard the cadres of the Zhima Camp Sub-district Office talk about the rapid and appropriate resettlement of demobilized soldiers. After investigation, he found that it did not entirely match the actual situation, and Xu Baoju criticized these grassroots cadres for their style of reporting good news and not reporting bad news.

During their inspection work in various regions, the deputies and members made many suggestions and criticisms to the relevant units based on the information they learned. Liang Sicheng, a deputy, inspected the construction of the workers' village in Shenyang. He believed that the construction of the workers' village wasted a lot of land, and the ratio of houses to open space was not appropriate. There were too many stairs in each building, with one staircase serving only two or three households, which not only reduced the utilization rate of traffic passages but also took up the usable area of the room. When Liang Shuming, a member, inspected the grassroots election work in various parts of Anhui, he found that some county and township people's congresses had not convened meetings as scheduled. For example, Xuan City had not convened a people's congress meeting last year. He suggested that the Provincial People's Committee should take effective measures to ensure that the People's Congress can convene meetings on schedule in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. After Zhang Wangbo, a deputy, inspected the situation of public-private joint ventures in various parts of Anhui, he believed that it is necessary to clarify the responsibilities and powers of private personnel in the future, and the public and private parties should be frank and open to further stimulate the enthusiasm of private personnel. At the same time, private personnel must also accept the leadership of the public and accept the opinions of the workers. He also suggested that the relevant departments should strengthen the organization and leadership of the political theory study of industrialists and businessmen in the future to help them carry out self-transformation.

The relevant units in various regions attached great importance to the opinions put forward by the deputies and members during the inspection. When Zhang Deqing, a member, inspected the Shanghai Auto Parts Factory, the factory sent a special person to follow him and record all the opinions he raised in order to improve the work based on these opinions. Some raw materials in the Jinqian Thermos Factory in Shanghai are very difficult to obtain, and if it cannot be resolved in the future, it may affect production. When Yang Gongshu, a member, inspected this factory, he found that they had wasted one-thousandth of the mercury applied to the glass liner. He suggested that the factory use hydrochloric acid or saline water to precipitate silver juice to avoid waste. The person in charge of the factory attached great importance to this suggestion and said that they would immediately conduct experiments. The deputies and members who inspected the Sujitan Public-Private Joint Ranch in Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, found that the ranch's income had decreased due to shortcomings in the work. They immediately reported this situation to the CPC Haibei Local Committee, the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee, and the person in charge of the ranch. These units agreed with their views and quickly corrected the errors.

    全国人民代表和政协委员视察结束
    对群众的意见和要求就地作了处理和交代
    根据所了解的情况向各地提出建议和批评
    新华社5日讯　全国人民代表大会代表和中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会委员在各地的视察工作已经结束。
    代表和委员们这次分别在全国二十二个省、两个自治区和三个直辖市进行了视察。许多年高的代表和委员也都深入群众进行访问，有的广泛地同各界人民建立了联系，接见来访的群众。他们在视察结束以后，大都把群众所提出的意见和要求就地作了妥善的处理和交代。王志莘等代表在上海视察时，为了视察国家领导下的自由市场上的蔬菜交易情况，在早晨三点多钟就起床前往市场。梁思成代表在沈阳视察时因身体不适而进了医院，但是他身体还没完全恢复健康就开始进行视察。许多代表和委员在视察时，对所了解的情况常常反复查对和分析研究。许宝驹代表在南京市建邺区视察时，听到直马营街道办事处的干部谈到关于复员军人安置得快、安置得适当等情况，经过调查，发现不完全符合实际，许宝驹对这些基层干部报喜不报忧的作风提出了批评。
    代表和委员们在各地视察工作时，根据所了解的情况，向有关单位提出了许多建议和批评。梁思成代表在沈阳视察了工人村的建筑情况。他认为工人村的建筑，浪费很多地皮，房子与空地的比例不相适应。每幢楼的楼梯太多，一个楼梯只为两三家服务，不仅降低了交通孔道的利用率，并且占去了室内的使用面积。梁漱溟委员在安徽各地视察基层选举工作时，发现有些县、乡人民代表大会没有按期召开会议，如宣城县去年就没有召开过人民代表大会会议。他建议省人民委员会应该采取有效措施，保证人民代表大会能够依照宪法规定按期召开会议。张綗伯代表在安徽各地视察了公私共事关系方面情况后，认为今后需要明确私方人员的职责权限，公私双方应该开诚相见，以进一步发挥私方人员的积极性；同时私方人员也必须接受公方的领导，接受工人群众的意见。他还建议有关部门，今后对工商业者的政治理论学习应该加强组织领导，帮助他们进行自我改造。
    各地有关单位对代表和委员们在视察中提出的意见都很重视。张德庆委员在上海汽车配件厂视察时，工厂特派专人跟随他，把他提出的意见全部记了下来，以便根据这些意见来改进工作。上海的金钱热水瓶厂的某些原料很困难，今后如果得不到解决，可能影响生产。杨公庶委员在视察这个工厂时，发现他们把往瓶胆上涂的千分之一的水银浪费掉了，他建议厂方用盐酸或食盐水沉淀银汁，以免浪费。工厂负责人很重视这个建议，表示要立即进行试验。青海省在海北藏族自治州视察苏吉滩公私合营牧场的代表和委员们，发现牧场由于工作中的缺点，致使牧场收入减少，他们把这个情况立即反映给中共海北地方委员会、自治州人民委员会和牧场负责人，这些单位同意他们的看法，并且很快地纠正了错误。
