    Several Deviations in Improving Handicraft Products

    Inclination to Make Large Items, Blind Processing
    The velvet small animals produced in Beijing, Yangzhou, and other places are brightly colored, small, and exquisite, and are very popular among the masses. However, there are very few such products on the market now, and the better ones are especially hard to find. Recently, I saw some newly designed velvet products at the Beijing Arts and Crafts Exhibition, but they were large velvet birds one or two feet high, as well as models of the Temple of Heaven, stone lions, and stages. These large velvet products, if used as decorations, have no artistic value and are very prone to fading and becoming old. This kind of “improvement” exceeds the limitations of the material conditions and fails to develop the artistic skills that are suitable for its characteristics, blindly trying to win with "large" size, resulting in a thankless task.
    There are similar situations in embroidery, also talking about "grandeur," as if as long as the area is larger and more labor and materials are used, it will definitely be better. At present, the so-called "high-grade embroidery" mostly uses paintings as drafts, spending years embroidering large pieces of stones and grass, truly sparing no expense! The result is that it is neither practical nor beautiful, let alone economical.
    It is said that making large items is to allow veteran artists to fully utilize their skills, but I think this statement is absurd.

    Abandoning Tradition, Indiscriminate Learning from Western Methods
    At present, some artists and cadres in various places, under the tide of "improvement" and "enhancement," are eager to achieve quick results, believing that improvement and enhancement means getting rid of the old and replacing it with the new, completely negating the old techniques, and blindly and reluctantly imitating Western methods. For example, some artists have also applied the perspective method of making distant objects smaller to stone-carved figure sculptures. The resulting groups of people gathered together are of different sizes, which is very bizarre. They forget that the viewer of a sculpture can see it from all directions. In relief sculpture, some people also use focal point perspective and pursue "natural forms," while abandoning the original "decorative interest" and the superiority of "scattered perspective" in expression in traditional techniques.
    Another example is Yu County's paper-cutting, which was originally known for its concise and simple style, especially the character images in classical dramas that were cut out, which were very interesting. However, recently they have also been painstakingly carrying out "improvement" and "enhancement," and have already carved a complete set of new works: the lines of the characters' clothing patterns have increased, the patterns have become finer, and the movements also strive for photographic realism, but at the same time, they have become weak, powerless, and dull. The flower and bird paper-cuts in the area originally had strong and distinct color contrasts, but now some have changed the red birds into gray birds like real birds, losing the original high folk art interest.
    It is said that the promotion of this tendency is related to the aesthetic standards held by the cadres in some departments who order and evaluate goods.

    Exclusively for Exhibition, Detached from Practicality
    Due to the improvement of China's international status and frequent international activities, a lot of arts and crafts must be selected every year to participate in international cultural exchanges and foreign trade exhibitions, and to supply the needs of gifts, which is necessary. But we must not take this as the only outlet for arts and crafts. For example, in bamboo weaving, in recent years, in order to pursue the effect of exhibitions, a lot of exquisite products have indeed been created. The decoration is becoming more and more gorgeous and rich, but the distance from people's lives is also getting farther and farther. Some exhibits for overseas exhibitions, such as everyday cushions, are indeed embroidered too nobly and delicately. No wonder international friends ask us: Do Chinese people use this kind of cushion?
    There are many problems in the production and sales of arts and crafts, and what is discussed here is just a random example. I hope to attract the attention of relevant departments. Jin Fengsun

### 改良手工艺产品的几种偏向

    改良手工艺产品的几种偏向
    好做大件　盲目加工
    北京、扬州等地出产的绒制小动物，色彩艳丽，小巧玲珑，很受群众欢迎。但目前市场上很少这类产品，较好的尤其不易见到。最近在北京市工艺美术展览会上看到了一些新设计的绒制品，却是一、二尺高的大型绒鸟，还有天坛、石狮子和舞台的模型等等。这些大型绒制品，如作为陈设品，既没有艺术价值，又极易褪色变旧。这种超越了材料条件的限制、不按照它的特性来发挥与之相适应的艺术技巧的
  “改良”，盲目地想以“大”取胜，结果是吃力不讨好的。
    刺绣方面也有类似的情况，也在讲“气派”，似乎只要面积越大、费工费料越多，就一定会越好。目前所谓“高级绣品”，大多以画作稿，用整年累月的时间去绣大块大块的石头、草地，真是不惜工本！结果是既不实用，也不美观，更不经济。
    据说做大件是为了让老艺人充分发挥技术，我看这说法是无稽的。
    抛开传统　滥学西法
    目前各地有些艺人和干部，在“改良”“提高”的浪潮下，急于求成，认为改良提高就是去旧更新，全部否定了旧的技法，盲目地勉强地去模拟西洋方法。例如有些艺人把远小近大的透视画法也用到石刻的人物圆雕上来了。形成聚集在一起的人群有大有小，十分离奇，他们忘记了圆雕的欣赏者是可以从四面八方来看它的。在浮雕上也同样有人采用焦点透视、追求“自然形态”，而丢弃了传统技法中原有的“装饰趣味”和“散点透视”在表现上的优越性。
    又如蔚县的剪纸，本来以简练质朴的风格见称，特别是所剪古典戏剧中的人物形象，十分有趣。可是最近也在煞费苦心地进行“改良”和“提高”了，并且已经刻出全套新作品：人物的衣纹线条增多了，花纹加细了，动作也力求照相式地真实了，而同时也就变得软弱无力、枯燥乏味了。该地的花鸟剪纸，原来色彩对比很强烈、很鲜明，现在有的把红色的鸟改为真鸟一样的灰色的鸟，失去了原来很高的民间艺术的趣味。
    据说这种倾向的促成，同某些部门定货评价的干部所持的审美标准有关。
    专供展览　脱离实用
    由于我国国际地位的提高，国际活动频繁，每年都要选送很多的工艺美术品参加国际性的文化交流和对外贸易性的展览，并供应礼品的需要，这是有必要的。但我们决不能以此为工艺美术品的唯一出路。如竹编制品，近年来为了追求展览效果，的确创作了不少精美的产品。装饰越来越华丽丰富，但与人民生活的距离也越来越远了。有些出国展览品例如日常使用的靠垫，实在绣得过于高贵精致了，难怪国际友人要向我们提出疑问：中国有人用这种靠垫吗？
    工艺美术品产销中的问题很多，这里所谈的不过是随便举的例子而已。希望引起有关部门的注意。          金逢孙
