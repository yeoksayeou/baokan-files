    Striving to Expand Our Country's Scientific Ranks
    Qian Weichang
    Science awards are an honor bestowed upon China's scientific community by the Party and the people, and they also represent expectations for the scientific community. Scientific work is a collective endeavor and a collective creation of scientists. It is unimaginable that any "genius" scientist could achieve anything independently, detached from the vast scientific community, transcending today's scientific level, and without the cooperation of other scientists. Each of our scientific workers' labor will, to a greater or lesser extent, bring a bit of accumulation to the progress of science; however, these accumulations are still very small compared to the knowledge of all scientific departments of all mankind. The purpose of science awards should not be seen merely as an encouragement to a few scientific workers, but as a broad encouragement to our scientific workers for their ordinary and arduous labor in various work positions. The honor of science awards should first be given to the old seniors of the scientific community with white hair. Because of their decades of unremitting, simple, and hard work, they have established some scientific foundations for our country, although weak, but still able to start working. Secondly, this honor should be given to those scientific colleagues who work hard in all teaching and scientific research positions to build the motherland and expand the scientific ranks.
    One of the important tasks of our scientific community at present is to expand the scientific ranks while improving the quality of scientific research. We cannot imagine that the current limited number of scientific teams can undertake the major task of developing scientific undertakings put forward by the country. We can't even imagine that a scientist without successors can contribute much to scientific undertakings and avoid being called an "armchair master." We also cannot imagine that our younger generation can grow rapidly without the support, encouragement, and leadership of the older generation. In order to develop China's scientific undertakings, we must train the younger generation, develop their talents, and make them surpass us. We should not only train graduate students and scientific work cadres in various work positions, but also vigorously strengthen the scientific strength of colleges and universities and improve the scientific level of college teaching.
    Working with young people often brings endless vitality to our work. We have put in a certain amount of labor to train young people, and the enthusiastic labor and rich imagination of young comrades have provided a lot of help to our work. Their growth is like our own growth, giving us great encouragement and strength.
    Cultivating young people is like cultivating the land. On the one hand, we have to put in labor, and on the other hand, we also get harvest. The more labor and the more intensive cultivation, the richer the harvest. Experience in working with young people for a long time proves that on the one hand, we must lead them, but on the other hand, we must give them the conditions and opportunities to work independently. The relationship between us and young people in work is one of leadership and being led, but in labor, we must pay attention to and recognize each other's achievements.
    In order to continuously expand the scientific ranks, the Academy of Sciences and colleges and universities need close cooperation. In colleges and universities, on the one hand, we must eliminate the remnants of thinking that is divorced from the scientific level and empty talks about improving the quality of teaching; on the other hand, we must also oppose the tendency to neglect teaching for the sake of scientific research. We should also pay attention to preventing the division of labor between colleges and universities that simply run education and the Academy of Sciences that simply do research. If colleges and universities do not attach importance to scientific research, they will inevitably become places for selling dead knowledge. Students who study in this atmosphere will greatly hinder their creative development and be cultivated into a lifeless dogmatist. This is very detrimental to the development of science.
    In order to develop China's scientific undertakings and expand the scientific ranks, we must oppose those irresponsible remarks that encourage scientists to completely leave their teaching positions and specialize in scientific research. Of course, we also oppose devoting all of the scientist's time to daily teaching work. We believe that as a true scientist, on the one hand, he has the responsibility to continuously develop scientific undertakings; but on the other hand, he also requires to spread and promote his knowledge in order to achieve the effect of science serving human life widely. At the same time, a teacher in a college or university, if he is a creator of knowledge, may also be an excellent disseminator of knowledge. Many great scientists in the world have spent their lives in schools, such as Lomonosov, Mendeleev, Vavilov, Einstein, Mr. Curie and his wife, etc. They all persisted in teaching and research work throughout their lives. Through their unremitting teaching and research work, they have trained countless outstanding scientists. These scientists are our role models.
    In recent years, the cooperation between the Chinese Academy of Sciences and various colleges and universities has been further strengthened, which is good news for the development of China's scientific undertakings. Many researchers from the Academy of Sciences are concurrently teaching in colleges and universities, and many teachers from colleges and universities are also concurrently doing research in the Academy of Sciences. This will have a positive impact on the development of China's scientific undertakings. However, we must also point out that there is still ample room for development in the cooperation between the Academy of Sciences and colleges and universities, and the organizational and ideological work of the cooperation between the two parties can be greatly improved. For the development of the motherland's scientific undertakings, our scientific workers require the Academy of Sciences and colleges and universities to be able to cooperate further.
    The Chinese Academy of Sciences' decision to award a bonus for the work on the large deflection problem of circular thin plates is a great encouragement to me and my colleagues. My scientific research work on this project began around 1947 before liberation. At that time, research work could not be carried out very well, and I only published one or two papers. After liberation, due to the busy work of teaching reform, my research work was suspended. It was not until after 1952 that it continued to work under the promotion and cooperation of young colleagues. Up to now, although this research has solved some problems, there are still a series of more practical related problems, such as the corrugated plate problem, that need our efforts. The research on these problems is not only an important problem in today's thin plate theory in theory, but also can save the consumption of metal materials in practice.
    This time, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has also rewarded such meager scientific work, which proves the party and the government's care and attention to scientific work. In the old society under reactionary rule, scientific work was only done by a few nerdy people who were ignored, and papers were published and could only be spread in publications with very small circulation. Under such conditions, scientific workers can at most carry out some work according to their personal interests in the face of difficult material conditions. After liberation, the Party and the government vigorously advocated science, and science has become a common cause of scientists and the people. In the process of building a socialist society, the country has put forward endless topics to scientific workers. The conditions for scientific work have also been improved, and science serving the people is no longer a slogan but a reality. Scientific undertakings are accelerating their development because they are combined with the needs of the country. I and my colleagues will work with scientific workers across the country to expand the scientific ranks and contribute all the strength that scientific workers can contribute to the construction of the socialist motherland.

    为壮大我国科学队伍而努力
    钱伟长
    科学奖金是党和人民给予我国科学界的荣誉，也表示了对科学界的期望。科学工作是科学家集体劳动和集体创造的事业，不能想像有任何“天才”的科学家，能够离开广大的科学队伍，超脱今天的科学水平，不要其它科学家的合作，而独自取得什么成就。我们每个科学工作者的劳动，都会或多或少地给科学的进展带来点滴的积累；但是，这些积累对于全人类的全部科学各部门的知识讲来还是非常渺小的。科学奖金的目的，不应当看作仅仅是对少数科学工作者的鼓励，而应当看作是在广泛地给予我们科学工作者们在各个工作岗位上平凡而又艰苦的劳动以鼓励。科学奖金的荣誉应该首先给予那些白发苍苍的科学界的老前辈。由于他们的数十年如一日的不懈的清苦的努力，才给我们国家建立起来了一些虽然薄弱但也还能开始工作的科学基础。其次，这个荣誉应该给予那些在一切教学和科学研究岗位上为建设祖国、为扩大科学队伍而努力工作的科学同事们。
    我们科学界当前的重要任务之一，是在提高科学研究质量的条件下扩大科学队伍。我们不能想像，只靠目前人数有限的科学队伍，能够担负当前国家提出的发展科学事业的重大任务。我们更不能想像，一个后继无人的科学家，能够对科学事业有多少发展，能不避免被称为“空中祖师”的。我们也不能想像，我们年青的一代，不需要老一辈的支持鼓励和领导，就能迅速地成长起来。为了发展我国的科学事业，我们必须培养青年一代，发展他们的才能，使他们青出于蓝，胜我们一筹。我们不仅要培养研究生和在各种工作岗位上的科学工作干部，而且应该大力加强高等学校的科学力量，提高高等学校教学的科学水平。
    同青年人一起工作，常常给我们的工作带来无穷尽的活力。我们为培养青年付出了一定的劳动，青年同志们的热情劳动和丰富的想像力又给我们的工作提供了不少帮助。他们的成长就好像我们自己在成长一样，给我们很大的鼓舞和力量。
    培养青年人，正好像在土地上耕耘一样，一方面我们要付出劳动，一方面我们也得到了收获。劳动越多，越深耕细作，收获也越丰富。同青年人长期工作的经验证明，我们一方面要领导他们，但在另一方面也一定要给他们独立工作的条件和机会。我们和青年人之间在工作上是领导和被领导的关系，但在劳动上必须重视各自的成果并予以承认。
    为了要不断扩大科学队伍，科学院和高等学校需要有密切的合作。在高等学校里，一方面要扫除那种脱离科学水平而空谈提高教学质量的残余思想；另一方面也必须反对那种为了科学研究而忽视教学的倾向。我们还应该注意防止那种高等学校单纯办教育，科学院单纯搞研究的分工思想。高等学校如果不重视科学研究工作，就必然要变成贩卖死知识的场所。学生们在这样的气氛下学习，就会大大地阻碍他们的创造性的发展，而培养成为一个暮气沉沉的教条主义者。这对于发展科学是非常不利的。
    为了发展我国科学事业，扩大科学队伍，我们必须反对那些鼓励科学家全部脱离教学岗位，专搞科学研究工作的不负责任的言论。当然我们也反对把科学家的全部时间都用到日常的教学工作中去。我们认为，作为一个真正的科学家，他一方面有责任不断地发展科学事业；但另一方面，他也要求传播和推广他的知识，以期达到科学广泛为人类生活服务的效果。同时，一个高等学校的教师，如果他是知识的创造者，也就可能是一个优良的知识的传播者。世界上许多伟大的科学家，都是在学校里渡过一生的，如罗蒙诺索夫，如门捷列也夫，如华维洛夫，如爱因斯坦，如居里先生和他的夫人等。他们都是终生地同时坚持着教学和研究工作的。通过他们不懈的教学工作和研究工作，培养出无数优秀的科学家。这些科学家是我们学习的榜样。
    近年来，中国科学院和各高等学校的合作进一步加强了，这是发展我国科学事业的好消息。科学院的不少研究工作者在高等学校里兼任着教学工作，不少高等学校的教师也在科学院兼任着研究工作。这对我国科学事业的发展将有良好的影响。但是，我们也必须指出，科学院同高等学校之间的合作，还有广阔发展的余地，在双方合作的组织工作和思想工作上，还可以大大地改善。我们科学工作者，为了祖国科学事业的发展，要求科学院和高等学校能够更进一步地合作。
    中国科学院决定对圆薄板大挠度问题的工作给予奖金，这对于我和我的同事们都是很大的鼓励。我的这项科学研究工作，开始于解放前1947年间。那时候研究工作不能够很好开展，我只发表了一两篇论文。解放后，由于教学改革等工作的繁忙，我的研究工作就停顿了下来。一直到1952年以后，在青年同事们推动和合作下，才继续工作下去。到现在，这项研究虽然已经解决了一些问题，但还有一系列更有实用价值的相关问题如波纹板问题等，尚待我们努力。这些问题的研究，不仅在理论上是今天薄板理论中的重要问题，并且在实用上可以节省金属材料的消耗。
    这次中国科学院对于这样一些微薄的科学工作也给予了奖励，正是证明了党和政府对于科学工作的爱护和重视。科学工作在反动统治的旧社会里，只是少数无人理睬的书呆子做的事，论文发表了也只能在流通量很小的书刊上传播。在这样的条件下，科学工作者至多就只能按个人的兴趣面对着艰苦的物质条件进行一些工作。解放后，党和政府大力提倡科学，科学已经是科学家和人民的共同事业。在建设社会主义社会的过程里，国家向科学工作者提出了无穷无尽的课题。科学工作的条件也改善了，科学为人民服务已经不是口号而是实际。科学事业由于结合了国家的需要正在加速地发展着。我和我的同事们，将和全国的科学工作者一起，努力扩大科学队伍，为建设社会主义的祖国尽科学工作者可能尽的一切力量。
