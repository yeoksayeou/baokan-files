The American Theory of "Power Vacuum"
	Cui Qi

Not long ago, US Secretary of State Dulles said at a press conference: the United States "is neither 100% with the colonial countries, nor does it stand on the side of countries that are primarily and completely concerned with achieving independence as soon as possible." He said that the United States "wants to play a special role."

What exactly is this "special role"? This seems very puzzling.

However, if you study the so-called "power vacuum" theory that the United States has been vigorously promoting recently, then Dulles's statement is easy to understand.

According to this "theory," if the people of a certain country or region drive away the colonial rulers, gain independence and freedom, and no longer belong to the "sphere of influence" of imperialism, a "power vacuum" will appear there. And once a "power vacuum" appears anywhere, it seems to bring "danger" to the "free world," so the United States must "fill" it.

This "theory" has two ways of being used.

First, when the people of a certain colonial country are fighting for independence and freedom, the United States shouts that they must not become independent "too early" or "too quickly"! Otherwise, a "power vacuum" will appear, which is not in the interests of the "free world." As a result, the United States openly supports the old colonial countries and suppresses the national independence movements there. The US attitude towards the Algerian issue is a very clear example. - This is what Dulles meant when he said that the United States does "not stand on the side of countries that are primarily and completely concerned with achieving independence as soon as possible"!

Second, when the people of a certain colonial country have stood up and are gradually driving out the forces of the old colonial countries, the United States shouts, "It's terrible! There is a "power vacuum" there. In order to "save" the interests of the "free world," the United States must use its own power to "fill" it." The purpose of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" recently proposed by the United States for Middle Eastern countries is to "fill the power vacuum created in the Middle East by the disappearance of British and French influence after the Suez offensive with American military and economic power."

The so-called "filling" is nothing more than the United States replacing the colonial status of Britain and France, seizing the colonial interests of Britain and France, and "filling" the insatiable appetite of the American colonialists themselves. No wonder the "Eisenhower Doctrine" caused unease in Britain and France. A United Press International dispatch from London on January 3 reported: "Many Britons believe that the American initiative is aimed at British oil interests." - This is what Dulles meant when he said that the United States is "not 100% with the colonial countries"!

It can be seen that the "special role" of the United States is to oppose national independence movements and squeeze out old colonial countries. It wants to fill the "power vacuum" anywhere in the world and establish a colonial empire with the greatest ambition.

If you ask why the United States calls newly independent countries a "power vacuum"? Then there can only be one answer: it simply does not recognize the independent sovereignty of these countries, does not recognize the will and power of the people of these countries, and, in short, does not even recognize the existence of the people of these countries themselves!

The US ruling group only sees oil and cotton, bases and canals in the Middle East, but does not see the people. "No one in sight"! This is the most arrogant manifestation of the American so-called "power vacuum" theory, and this is the most arrogant manifestation of the "Eisenhower Doctrine"!

However, the American colonialists, like the British and French colonialists, are also doomed because they "have no one in sight." Today, from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Arabian coast, millions of peace-loving and freedom-loving people have ignited the flames of anti-colonialism. This is not a "power vacuum." This is filled with the powerful force of national independence movements. The Egyptian people and the Middle Eastern people have driven out the British and French colonialists, and they will never allow American colonialists to take the opportunity to enter. One day, the people of the Middle East will expel all colonial forces completely, thoroughly, and cleanly, thereby creating a real "vacuum" on that vast land that colonial forces can never invade! This glorious day will not be far away.

In the past, in order to prepare for foreign aggression, Hitler invented the so-called "living space" theory. However, the only "space" suitable for the "survival" of fascist aggressors that he found was the tomb. Today, American aggressive forces are also unlikely to find a "power vacuum" for them to "fill" at will. All peace-loving and freedom-loving people will work together and ultimately send aggressive forces and colonialism to the tomb.

    美国的所谓“势力真空”论
    崔奇
    不久以前，美国国务卿杜勒斯在记者招待会上说过这样一句话：美国“既不百分之百地与殖民国家为伍，也不站在主要和完全关心尽快取得独立的问题的国家方面”。他说，美国“要起一种特殊的作用”。
    究竟是什么“特殊作用”呢？这似乎是很费解的。
    但是，如果你研究一下美国最近大肆宣传的所谓“势力真空”论，那么，杜勒斯的这一句话就容易理解了。
    按照这种“理论”，某一国家或地区的人民要是赶走了殖民统治者，取得了独立自由，不再属于帝国主义的“势力范围”，那里就会出现“势力真空”。而“势力真空”在任何地方一旦出现，似乎就会给“自由世界”带来“危险”，于是就必须由美国来“填补”它。
    这种“理论”有两种运用方式。
    第一种，当某一个殖民地国家的人民正在争取独立自由的时候，美国就大喊，不能“过早”、“过快”地独立呀！否则就会出现“势力真空”，不符合“自由世界”的利益。于是美国公开支持老牌殖民国家，镇压那里的民族独立运动。美国对阿尔及利亚问题的态度就是很清楚的例子。——这就是杜勒斯所说的美国并“不站在主要和完全关心尽快取得独立的问题的国家方面”！
    第二种，当某一个殖民地国家的人民已经站起来，正在步步地把老牌殖民国家的势力驱逐出去的时候，美国就大喊，不得了！那里出现了“势力真空”，为了“挽救”“自由世界”的利益，美国必须用自己的势力来“填补”。最近美国针对中东国家提出的“艾森豪威尔主义”的目的，就是要“用美国的军事和经济力量，填满英法在进攻苏伊士以后由于影响的消逝而在中东造成的势力真空”。
    所谓“填补”，那不过是由美国代替英法的殖民地位，夺取英法的殖民利益，来“填补”美国殖民者自己的贪婪无厌的胃口而已。无怪乎“艾森豪威尔主义”引起了英法的不安。合众社伦敦1月3日电讯报道：“许多英国人认为美国的这种倡议是针对英国的石油利益的。”——这些就是杜勒斯所说的美国也并“不百分之百地与殖民国家为伍”！
    可见美国的“特殊作用”就是既反对民族独立运动，又排挤老牌殖民国家，它要填满世界上任何地方的“势力真空”，建立一个野心最大的殖民帝国。
    如果问，美国为什么把刚刚走上独立道路的国家叫做“势力真空”呢？那么答案只能有一个：它根本不承认这些国家的独立主权，不承认这些国家人民的意志和力量，而且，简直也不承认这些国家人民本身的存在！
    美国统治集团在中东只看到石油和棉花，基地和运河，而看不见人民。“目中无人”！这就是美国所谓“势力真空”论的最狂妄的表现，这也就是“艾森豪威尔主义”的最狂妄的表现！
    但是，美国殖民者同英法殖民者一样，他们倒霉的地方也就在于“目中无人”。今天，从直布罗陀海峡直到阿拉伯海滨，千百万爱好和平与自由的人民已经燃遍了反殖民主义的烽火。这儿不是“势力真空”，这儿充满着民族独立运动的强大力量。埃及人民和中东人民已经把英法殖民者赶走了，他们绝不允许美国殖民者乘机而入。总会有一天，中东人民将把殖民主义势力全部、彻底、干净地驱逐出去，从而在那广阔的土地上造成一个殖民主义势力永远不能侵入的真正的“真空”！这个光辉的日子不会很远了。
    从前，希特勒为了准备对外侵略，曾经发明了所谓“生存空间”论。但是，他找到的唯一适合于法西斯侵略者“生存”的“空间”却是坟墓。今天，美国侵略势力也同样不可能找到让它随意“填补”的“势力真空”。一切爱好和平和自由的人民将同心合力，最后把侵略势力和殖民主义都送到坟墓里去。
