Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 4th: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee began discussing the Korean issue on the morning of January 3rd. This issue includes two parts: (1) the report of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea; (2) the report of the Indian government on the issue of former prisoners of war.

At the beginning of the meeting, the United States delegation put forward a proposal requesting that representatives of the South Korean Syngman Rhee regime be invited to participate in the discussion. This proposal was supported by representatives from Britain, Australia, the Philippines, and several other countries.

The Indian delegation proposed an amendment to the US proposal, advocating that representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea also be invited to participate in the discussion. Representatives from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, Albania, Romania, Ukraine, Belarus, and Ceylon supported this amendment. They pointed out that representatives from both sides of Korea should attend and participate in the discussions; otherwise, the discussions, like in previous years, would become one-sided and unable to achieve positive results.

During the vote, the committee rejected the Indian amendment and passed the US proposal. The results of the vote on the Indian amendment were: twenty votes in favor, forty votes against, and eleven abstentions. The results of the vote on the US proposal were: fifty-one votes in favor, ten votes against, and twelve abstentions.

The committee decided to continue discussing the Korean issue on the 4th.

    联大政委会开始讨论朝鲜问题
    在美国操纵下决定只邀请南朝鲜一方参加讨论
    新华社4日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会3日早上开始讨论朝鲜问题，这个问题包括两部分：（一）联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会的报告；（二）印度政府关于前战俘问题的报告。
    会议一开始，美国代表团就提出一个建议，要求邀请南朝鲜李承晚政权代表参加讨论。这个建议得到英国、澳大利亚、菲律宾和其他一些国家的代表的支持。
    印度代表团对美国的建议提出一项修正案，主张同时邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加讨论。苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫、波兰、阿尔巴尼亚、罗马尼亚、乌克兰、白俄罗斯和锡兰等国代表支持这个修正案。他们指出，朝鲜双方的代表都应该列席参加讨论，不然讨论就会像过去几年一样变成片面的，不能取得积极的结果。
    在表决时，委员会否决了印度的修正案而通过美国的建议。印度修正案的表决结果是：二十票赞成，四十票反对，十一票弃权。美国的建议的表决结果是：五十一票赞成，十票反对，十二票弃权。
    委员会决定在4日继续讨论朝鲜问题。
