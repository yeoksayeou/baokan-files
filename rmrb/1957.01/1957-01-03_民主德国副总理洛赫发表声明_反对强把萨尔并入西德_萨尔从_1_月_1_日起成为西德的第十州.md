Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 1st dispatch from TASS: Loch, Chairman of the German Unity Committee and Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, issued a statement on the Saar issue, saying that incorporating the Saar into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's aggressive system is contrary to the national interests of the German people and the interests of European peace. The residents of the Saar had already expressed their opposition to merging their region into West Germany during the plebiscite held on October 23, 1955.

The statement emphasized that the German people cannot recognize the unilateral incorporation of the Saar into West Germany. The solution to the Saar issue is a matter for the entire German nation. Only a peaceful solution to the German question as a whole within the framework of a European security system can thoroughly resolve this issue.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 2nd dispatch: Saarbrücken news: From January 1st, the Saar has been officially politically incorporated into West Germany, becoming West Germany's tenth state. The West German constitution will henceforth be implemented in this region.

The incorporation of the Saar into West Germany is based on the Saar Treaty signed by West Germany and France last October. This treaty stipulates that the Saar, rich in coal and steel, will be politically incorporated into West Germany from January 1st of this year, and will be economically integrated into West Germany by the end of 1959. As the price of this deal, West Germany will supply France with 90 million tons of Saar coal over the next twenty-five years and agree to build the Moselle Canal needed by French steel industrialists.

West German Chancellor Adenauer and some West German ministers made a special trip to Saarbrücken, the capital of the Saar, on January 1st to attend the celebration of the Saar's incorporation into West Germany. According to Agence France-Presse, only two thousand of Saarbrücken's 130,000 residents participated in the day's celebrations.

    民主德国副总理洛赫发表声明
    反对强把萨尔并入西德
    萨尔从1月1日起成为西德的第十州
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社柏林1日讯：德国统一委员会主席、德意志民主共和国副总理洛赫就萨尔问题发表声明说，把萨尔并入北大西洋公约组织侵略体系是违背德国人民民族利益和欧洲和平利益的。萨尔的居民曾经在1955年10月23日举行全民投票的时候表示反对把他们一区并入西德。
    声明强调指出，德国人民不能承认片面地把萨尔并入西德。萨尔问题的解决是德国全国的事情。只有在欧洲安全体系范围内结合全德国问题的和平解决才能彻底解决这个问题。
    据新华社柏林2日电　萨尔布鲁根消息：从1月1日起，萨尔在政治上正式并入西德，成为西德的第十州。西德宪法将从此在这个地区实行。
    萨尔并入西德是根据西德和法国在去年10月签订的萨尔条约而实现的。这项条约规定盛产煤钢的萨尔从今年1月1日起在政治上并入西德，并且在1959年年底以前完成在经济上并入西德。作为这宗交易的代价，西德将在今后二十五年内供给法国九千万吨萨尔的煤，并且同意修建法国钢铁工业家所需要的摩塞尔运河。
    西德总理阿登纳和西德的一些部长特别在1日赶到萨尔的首府萨尔布鲁根去参加萨尔并入西德的庆祝会。据法新社报道，在萨尔布鲁根的十三万居民中，只不过二千人参加了这一天的庆祝活动。
