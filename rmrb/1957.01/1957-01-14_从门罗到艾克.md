    From Monroe to Eisenhower
    When American government officials and propaganda machines are touting the "Eisenhower Doctrine," they invariably compare it to the "Monroe Doctrine" of one hundred and thirty-three years ago and the "Truman Doctrine" of nine years ago, as if this would elevate the "Eisenhower Doctrine." In an article published on New Year's Eve last year, "New York Times" reporter John Reston made a particularly detailed comparison between the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and the "Monroe Doctrine." Although there are many far-fetched nonsense in this article, it helps people recognize that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is more ferocious than the past expansion plans of the United States.
    In order to emphasize the common ground between the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and the "Monroe Doctrine," Reston insisted that the "Monroe Doctrine" was produced because the United States was threatened by the expansion of Tsarist Russia at that time, while the "Eisenhower Doctrine" was to prevent the invasion of the Middle East by Soviet forces. But Reston immediately admitted that the so-called dealing with Russia was just a guise, he said: "In fact, a major motive of the Monroe Doctrine was to ensure the expansion of the United States' territory, from the eastern part of North America at that time to the entire American continent." Although Reston left half of his words and did not say the "main motive" of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," it is not difficult for people to see how Eisenhower brilliantly inherited Monroe's mantle.
    However, the guise of "dealing with the Russians" is obviously more difficult to fool people with the "Eisenhower Doctrine" than with the "Monroe Doctrine." Reston said: "The Monroe Doctrine advocates excluding the Russians in areas close to the United States," while the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is to "exclude the Russians in areas close to the Soviet Union." Reston's statement in fact revealed the increasingly arrogant aggressive ambitions of the United States from the "Monroe Doctrine" to the "Eisenhower Doctrine" over the past one hundred years.
    Reston made such an effective comparison of the "Monroe Doctrine" and the "Eisenhower Doctrine," he said: The Monroe Doctrine actually said to the Europeans: "You stay there, we will stay here," while the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is more aggressive, it said to the Europeans: "You stay there, but we can't stay here, because now the resources of the Middle East are very important to the security of the free world." This is the wonderful annotation of the United States' so-called "filling the power vacuum theory."
    British and French colonists may today agree to this arrangement of American colonists as helplessly as their ancestors, but how will the people of the Middle East answer the drafters of the "Eisenhower Doctrine"? The people of the Middle East will tell them in a firm tone: "You should honestly stay there, there is no place for you here."

    从门罗到艾克
    美国的政府官员和宣传机器在鼓吹“艾森豪威尔主义”的时候，总不免要把它同一百三十三年前的“门罗主义”和九年前的“杜鲁门主义”相提并论，仿佛这样就能够抬高“艾森豪威尔主义”的身价。“纽约时报”记者约翰·赖斯顿在去年除夕发表的一篇文章就特别把“艾森豪威尔主义”同“门罗主义”作了一番详尽的比较。尽管这篇文章有不少牵强附会的胡言乱语，但是它却有助于使人们认清“艾森豪威尔主义”比美国过去的扩张计划更为凶恶。
    赖斯顿为了强调“艾森豪威尔主义”和“门罗主义”的共同点，硬说“门罗主义”的产生是由于美国当时受到帝俄扩张的威胁，而“艾森豪威尔主义”则是为了防止苏联势力对中东地区的侵入。但是赖斯顿马上又承认，所谓对付俄国不过是一种幌子，他说：“其实门罗主义的一个主要动机是要确保美国扩张的地盘，从当时只限于北美东部地区扩展到整个美洲大陆。”赖斯顿虽然话留半句，没有把“艾森豪威尔主义”的“主要动机”也说出来，但是人们已不难看出艾森豪威尔是怎样出色地继承了门罗的衣钵。
    然而“对付俄国人”这个幌子，对于“艾森豪威尔主义”比对“门罗主义”显然是更难骗人了。赖斯顿说：“门罗主义是主张在靠近美国的地区排斥俄国人”，而“艾森豪威尔主义”却是要“在靠近苏联的地区排斥俄国人”。赖斯顿这样一说，事实上就把美国从“门罗主义”到“艾森豪威尔主义”这一百多年间日益狂妄的侵略野心和盘托出了。
    赖斯顿对“门罗主义”和“艾森豪威尔主义”作了这样有效的比较，他说：门罗主义实际上是对欧洲人说：“你们呆在你们那儿，我们将呆在我们这儿”，而“艾森豪威尔主义”则更富有侵略性，它对欧洲人说：“你们呆在你们这儿，而我们却不能呆在我们这儿，因为现在中东的资源是对自由世界的安全十分重要的。”这就是美国所谓“填补势力真空论”的绝妙的注解。
    英国和法国的殖民者今天也许像他们的祖宗一样无可奈何地同意美国殖民者的这种安排，但是中东人民会怎样回答“艾森豪威尔主义”的拟订者呢？中东人民将会用坚定的语气告诉他们：“你们还是老老实实呆在你们那儿罢，我们这儿没有你们立脚的地方”
