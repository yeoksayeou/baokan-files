Kunming, January 4th (By our own correspondent) The Shangsuan Agricultural Cooperative in Jinning County, Yunnan Province, plans to raise over 10,000 pigs this year to support national economic construction. The Shangsuan Agricultural Cooperative is an advanced cooperative comprising over 1,900 households. Since its establishment, the cooperative has achieved bumper harvests every year. Last November, when Xie Fuzhi, the First Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, inspected the work of the cooperative, he pointed out that they could still do a lot of work in developing agricultural and sideline production, especially in developing pig farming. He suggested that the Shangsuan Agricultural Cooperative take the lead in raising pigs. Recently, Xie Fuzhi wrote to them again, hoping that they would continue to increase production in agriculture, but also ensure greater success in sideline occupations—especially pig and chicken farming. Enclosed with this letter was an article by Song Bao'en, Deputy Director of the Shimen Song Township Agricultural Cooperative in Yanggu County, Shandong Province, entitled "Our Cooperative Will Raise 20,000 Pigs." This article greatly encouraged the Shangsuan Agricultural Cooperative. After carefully studying the article, and based on the conditions of their own cooperative, they unanimously agreed: If the Shimen Song Township Agricultural Cooperative can do it, so can our Shangsuan Cooperative. This place has "spring all year round," and the conditions for planting and collecting green fodder are much better than in Yanggu County. Therefore, the cooperative decided to increase the current collectively raised 854 pigs to 2,160, and to increase the 455 pigs privately raised by members to 9,100.

    In order to solve the problem of lacking pig sources, the cooperative decided to raise a large number of sows. Currently, there are twelve publicly raised sows and 627 privately raised sows by members. These sows can produce twice a year. The piglets born this year can also produce once. Calculated in this way, there will be more than 10,000 pigs. In addition to self-raising within the cooperative, a portion of the piglets can also be sold. According to the above plan, by the end of this year, the Shangsuan Agricultural Cooperative will have 12,000 fat pigs, sows, and piglets. This plan has been unanimously welcomed by the members.

    In order to solve the problem of pig feed, the cooperative plans to plant a large number of loofah gourds and a type of millet that can be used as feed, and to reserve the rice bran obtained from milling rice for feed. The broad beans planted in the cooperative this year are growing particularly well, and the husks can also be used to feed pigs. At a recent meeting of female members, members from Anle Village also introduced their experience in collecting duckweed and gray peach vegetables as pig feed.

    Three days after the cooperative's pig raising plan was formulated, more than 30 member households bought piglets; many sows also gave birth to piglets. (Li Chengzhang)

    农业社养猪潜力很大
    上蒜社今年计划养一万多头
    本报昆明4日电　云南省晋宁县上蒜农业社，今年将要养猪一万多头，支援国家经济建设。上蒜农业社是一个包括一千九百多户的高级社。这个社从成立以来，年年都获得丰收。在去年11月间，中共云南省委第一书记谢富治到这个社检查工作的时候，曾经指出，他们在发展农副业生产方面还可以作许多工作，特别在发展生猪方面。他建议上蒜农业社带头养猪。最近，谢富治又写信给他们，希望他们在农业上继续增产，但又要保证副业——特别是养猪、养鸡方面获得更大的成绩。在这封信里，还附来山东省阳谷县石门宋乡农业社副主任宋保恩写的“我们一个社要养猪两万头”的文章。这篇文章，给了上蒜农业社很大的鼓舞。他们认真地研究了这篇文章以后，根据本社的条件，一致认为：石门宋乡农业社能做到，我们上蒜社也能做到。这个地方“四季皆春”种植和采集青饲料的条件比阳谷县好得多。所以，这个社决定把现在集体养的八百五十四头猪增加到二千一百六十头，把社员私养的四百五十五头猪增加到九千一百头。
    为了解决缺乏猪源问题，这个社决定大量饲养母猪。现在，公养的母猪有十二头，社员私养的母猪有六百二十七头。这些母猪在一年中可以生产两次。今年生的小母猪还可以生一次。这样算，就有一万多头猪。除了本社自养以外，还能出卖一部分小猪。按照上面的计划，到今年底，上蒜农业社将有肥猪、母猪、小猪一万二千头。这个计划受到社员的一致欢迎。
    为了解决养猪的饲料问题，这个社打算种植大批洋丝瓜和一种可作饲料的小米，把碾米所得的米糠留起来，充作饲料。今年社里种的蚕豆生长得特别好，糠壳也可以养猪。在最近召开的女社员会议上，安乐村社员还介绍了采集浮萍草、灰桃菜作猪饲料的经验。
    这个社的养猪计划订出后三天，就有三十多户社员买了小猪；不少母猪也下了小猪。（李成章）
