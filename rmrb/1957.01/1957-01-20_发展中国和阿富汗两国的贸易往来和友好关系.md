    Developing Trade and Friendly Relations Between China and Afghanistan
    Zhang Jun
    Afghanistan is one of China's close and friendly neighbors. The friendship between the Chinese and Afghan peoples can be traced back more than two thousand years. In the second century BC, Zhang Qian, a great geographer of the Han Dynasty in China, was sent as an envoy to Afghanistan. For more than two thousand years, the people of China and Afghanistan have maintained good neighborly relations, and their economic and cultural exchanges have been very frequent. Silk, tea, cotton fabrics, and many other handicrafts produced in China were transported to Afghanistan very early and then transshipped to the distant West through Afghanistan. Many products produced in Afghanistan, such as cotton, medicinal materials, spices, and oils, were also continuously imported into China. Around the Tang Dynasty in China, Buddhism and Islamic culture were introduced into China, many of which also came through Afghanistan. Many famous travelers in Chinese history have been to Afghanistan, and they have left many valuable records about the friendship between the two peoples.
    Since the main transportation routes of the world changed to sea routes, especially after Western colonialists invaded Afghanistan and China, the friendly exchanges and economic and cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Afghan peoples have been hindered. However, with the independence of the Kingdom of Afghanistan and the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, the traditional friendly relations between China and Afghanistan have been restored on a new basis and have developed further.
    Shortly after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the government of the Kingdom of Afghanistan announced its recognition of China in January 1950. In January 1955, China and Afghanistan officially established diplomatic relations and exchanged diplomatic envoys in Beijing and Kabul. During the Bandung Conference in 1955, the leaders of the two governments personally made contact and held talks, which further enhanced mutual understanding and played an extremely important role in developing friendly relations between the two countries.
    The economic and cultural relations between China and Afghanistan have also gradually recovered and developed. In August and September 1956, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, at the invitation of relevant parties in Afghanistan, participated in the "1956 Afghanistan Independence Day Industrial Exhibition" held in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. During the opening of the exhibition, it received more than 157,000 visitors from all walks of life in Afghanistan. The King of Afghanistan, the Prime Minister, and officials of the Kingdom government visited China's pavilion. Afghan visitors were deeply impressed by China's construction work in recent years. Many people from Afghan business circles, when they saw the commodities exhibited in China, expressed their desire to purchase machinery, industrial products, and other commodities needed by the Afghan people from China. During that exhibition, China's cultural and artistic delegation also paid a visit and performed in Afghanistan, and was warmly welcomed by the Afghan people. In June and July of the same year, the cultural delegation of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, headed by Dr. Popal, visited China and was also warmly welcomed by the Chinese people. In October, Dr. Sohail, the mayor of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, paid a friendly visit to China. These friendly contacts and exchanges have greatly strengthened the mutual understanding between the people of the two countries and enhanced the friendship between the two countries.
    With the development of friendly relations between the two countries, the two governments and peoples increasingly feel the necessity of further developing trade between the two countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The Chinese people are working hard to overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan and plan the Second Five-Year Plan. The Kingdom of Afghanistan also announced a five-year plan in 1956, including projects such as expanding cultivated land by 500,000 acres, building 1,000 kilometers of roads, developing electricity production, and building industries. There are quite a few commodities that the people of the two countries can exchange in their economic lives. For example, China can supply Afghanistan with tea, silk fabrics, cotton fabrics, building materials, paper, and machinery; Afghanistan can supply China with raw cotton, wool, sheepskins, flax seeds, sesame, and other products. Based on this common desire, the relevant parties of the two governments made contact in September 1956, and officially began negotiations on the conclusion of a trade and payment agreement between the two governments on October 24. During the negotiations, the delegations of the two countries fully studied and discussed various issues related to the development of Sino-Afghan trade in a very friendly atmosphere. There is no doubt that the development of trade between China and Afghanistan will bring benefits to the construction undertakings and the economic lives of the people of the two countries, and will help promote the further development of the friendship between the two peoples.

    发展中国和阿富汗两国的贸易往来和友好关系
    张俊
    阿富汗是我国亲切的友好邻邦之一。中国人民同阿富汗人民之间的友谊可以追溯到两千多年之前。在公元前二世纪，我国汉代的一位伟大的地理学家张骞就曾出使到阿富汗。两千多年来，中阿两国人民始终保持着睦邻关系，相互间的经济、文化交流曾经十分频繁。我国出产的丝绸、茶叶、棉织品和其他许多手工艺品，很早就曾运往阿富汗，并且通过阿富汗而转运到遥远的西方。阿富汗出产的棉花、药材、香料和油脂等许多种产品，也曾源源输入我国。在我国唐代前后，佛教和伊斯兰教文化传入我国，也有许多是经过阿富汗传来的。我国历史上的一些著名旅行家，不少人到过阿富汗，他们留下了许多关于两国人民的友情的珍贵纪录。
    自从世界的主要交通改由海道，特别是在西方殖民主义者侵略阿富汗和中国之后，中、阿两国人民之间的友好往来和经济文化交流就受到阻碍。但是，随着阿富汗王国的取得独立和中国人民革命的胜利，中阿两国的传统的友好关系又在新的基础上得到恢复，并且向前更加发展了。
    中华人民共和国成立后不久，阿富汗王国政府便在1950年1月宣布承认我国，1955年1月中阿两国正式建立了外交关系，并在北京和喀布尔互相派驻了外交使节。在1955年召开的万隆会议期间，两国政府的领导人亲自进行了接触和晤谈，更增进了彼此间的了解，对发展两国间的友好关系起了极其重要的作用。
    中阿两国之间的经济、文化关系也逐渐恢复和发展。1956年8、9月间，我国国际贸易促进委员会应阿富汗有关方面的邀请，参加了在阿富汗首都喀布尔举行的“1956年阿富汗独立日工业博览会”。在展览会开幕期间，共接待了阿富汗各阶层观众十五万七千多人。阿富汗国王、首相及王国政府的官员们都参观了我国展览馆。阿富汗观众对于我国近几年来的建设工作曾获有深刻的印象。阿富汗的许多工商界人士在看到我国展出的商品时，纷纷表示要向我国购买机器、工业品及其他为阿富汗人民所需要的商品。在那次展览会期间，我国的文化艺术代表团也在阿富汗进行了访问演出，受到了阿富汗人民的热烈欢迎。同年6、7月间，以波帕尔博士为首的阿富汗王国文化代表团访问了我国，同样也受到了我国人民的热烈欢迎。10月间，阿富汗首都喀布尔市市长索海尔博士又到我国进行了友好访问。这一些友好的接触和交往，大大地加强了两国人民之间的相互了解，增进了两国的友谊。
    随着两国友好关系的发展，两国政府和人民日益感到在平等互利的基础上进一步发展两国间贸易的必要性。我国人民正在努力超额完成第一个五年计划和规划第二个五年计划。阿富汗王国在1956年也宣布了一个五年计划，包括扩大耕地五十万英亩、铺筑一千公里道路、发展电力生产和建设工业等项目。两国人民在经济生活中，可以互通有无的商品是相当多的。例如，我国可以供应阿富汗以茶叶、丝织品、棉织品、建筑材料、纸张和机械等产品；阿富汗可以供应我国以原棉、羊毛、羊皮、亚麻籽、芝麻等产品。基于这种共同的愿望，两国政府的有关方面在1956年9月就进行了接触，10月24日起正式开始了关于缔结两国政府间的贸易和支付协定的谈判。在谈判的过程中，两国代表团在非常友好的气氛下，对发展中阿贸易的各种问题充分地进行了研究和讨论。毫无疑问，中阿两国贸易的发展，必将为两国的建设事业和人民的经济生活带来利益，而且有助于促进两国人民的友谊的进一步发展。
