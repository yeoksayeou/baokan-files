Xinhua News Agency, Liaocheng, 30th -- Xinhua News Agency reporter Song Jie reports: The Shandong Province Liaocheng Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at a recent meeting of county party secretaries, discussed the current situation of draught animals being thin, dying, and decreasing in number, and formulated specific measures to stop and reverse this situation.

According to statistics from various counties, the Liaocheng Special District had a total of 700,700 draught animals when agricultural cooperativization was realized at the end of December last year. By the end of November this year, 150,000 had died (including some old animals rationally culled). Adding the 70,000 that were bred and purchased from other places during the year, the entire special district now has only 627,000 draught animals. According to statistics from various counties, about 100,000 of the existing draught animals are seriously weak and difficult to survive the winter. More than 10,000 died in the first ten days of December alone. At the same time, the breeding and reproduction of livestock are also decreasing year by year. This year, the entire special district bred a total of 20,000 young animals, a decrease of 40% compared with last year. Because of the decrease in livestock, the average cultivated land burden for each pair of oxen has increased from about 70 mu last year to more than 80 mu. In some counties, because of insufficient animal power when planting wheat, they had to organize manpower to pull seed drills. Many agricultural cooperatives have also had to change from double-wheeled double-furrow plows to single-furrow plows.

When analyzing the reasons for this situation, the meeting considered that, in addition to the low valuation of draught animals when they were converted into shares in the cooperative, there are still many urgent problems in the management of livestock in agricultural cooperatives. For example, insufficient attention is paid to the selection and education of feeders; most cooperatives still lack a complete system of contracting for feeding and caring for animals, as well as for the use, management, and reproduction of draught animals; with the expansion of cooperatives, the feeding facilities within the cooperative are poor, and centralized feeding of livestock increases management difficulties, etc., all of which can cause draught animals to become sick, weak, and die.

In order to quickly reverse this situation, the meeting proposed that each cooperative should immediately conduct a screening of existing livestock. Sick animals should be fed separately. Draught animals that are weak due to improper use and feeding should be assigned to special personnel for feeding and should be given more fodder. Cooperatives that centrally feed livestock should immediately add equipment if they can. Those that cannot afford to add equipment should resolutely disperse the feeding. Those that do not have fodder at present should quickly take out a portion from the cooperative's stored grain or the oil cakes controlled by the supply and marketing cooperative, and actively make plans for forage and feed, striving to ensure that all draught animals safely survive the winter.

The meeting also required that all agricultural cooperatives, in conjunction with winter production and democratic rectification of the commune, systematically summarize the experience and lessons of contracting for livestock feeding and care over the past year. It advocated contracting livestock care to teams and changing the practice of large communes setting up special feeding teams. Each commune should formulate a set of livestock management and reward and punishment systems that integrate feeding, service, and veterinary medicine. Regarding the selection of feeders, attention should be paid to feeding techniques and political conditions, and they should be regularly educated to love the commune and love the animals, to prevent feeders from skimping on work, stealing materials, and stealing grass. Each commune should also make specific plans for the breeding and raising of young animals, and conscientiously implement the spirit of "self-breeding, self-raising, self-use, and making surpluses."

The meeting also required that the production cooperation departments of the local and county Party committees, together with relevant government departments, specifically grasp this work and report the situation to the Party committee regularly. Agricultural cooperatives should also have a deputy director in charge of this work, so as to promptly check for problems and solve them.

This newspaper reports: In order to protect livestock to safely pass the winter, the agricultural production cooperatives of Guangrao County, Shandong, have recently generally conducted in-depth inspections of the draught animal feeding situation, with great results.

Since the beginning of winter, some agricultural cooperatives have not paid enough attention to protecting draught animals through the winter. The secretary of the Guangrao County Party Committee, accompanied by the secretary of the district Party committee, personally went to fourteen production teams in Li Que district, looked at fourteen livestock pens, and found that the district's statement that there were no problems with livestock safely passing the winter did not match the facts. For example, the second team of Heping Cooperative in Lv Ming Township did not even have a pen at the time, and seven or eight livestock were tethered in the open courtyard day and night. The tenth team of Guanghui Agricultural Cooperative crowded eighteen livestock into two small pens. Based on the information learned from the investigation, the Guangrao County Party Committee specifically discussed the issue of protecting draught animals through the winter at the county party committee meeting held on December 19th, and at the district party committee meeting held on the 20th, the improvement of draught animal feeding management was put forward as an important task. Recently, a winter draught animal feeding situation inspection has been carried out relatively widely throughout the county. The inspection method is generally to organize the feeders and commune and team cadres of each commune to jointly go to each pen to see. Some communes combined the inspection with mass visits and comparisons, commended the teams with good feeding management, selected model feeders, and gave rewards. Some communes have also established a system for improving feeding. For example, in San Shui Agricultural Cooperative in Bo Xi District, a deputy director is specifically responsible for leading the feeding of livestock. The feeders of each team in this cooperative hold a meeting every five days to jointly discuss ways to improve feeding, and often conduct mutual visits and inspections. Some communes have adjusted the strength of the feeders, selecting enthusiastic, hardworking, and capable activists from the commune members to be feeders.

Distributing the livestock raised by each team to commune members for responsible feeding is an effective way to protect the livestock so that they can pass the winter safely. Many agricultural cooperatives have adopted reasonable methods that benefit both the public and private interests, such as setting grass, setting materials, setting fatness, setting manure, and setting work points, which have greatly increased the enthusiasm of commune members to feed livestock. Of the 150 livestock in Lv Ming Township, 100 have already been taken home by commune members for feeding. Fifteen of the eighteen livestock in the tenth team of Guanghui Cooperative have already been dispersed to commune members for feeding. The commune members said, "We guarantee that the livestock's residence will be warm, they will eat comfortably, and they will not lose weight." (Xiao Yan)

    组织参观评比　改进饲养制度　奖励好饲养员
    聊城等地积极保护耕畜安全过冬
    经验证明：适当分散给社员负责喂养也是一个好办法
    新华社聊城30日电　新华社记者宋杰报道：中共山东省聊城地方委员会在最近召开的县委书记会议上，就目前耕畜瘦弱、死亡和减少的情况作了讨论，并且制定了停止和扭转这种情况的具体措施。
    根据各县统计，聊城专区在去年12月底实现农业合作化的时候，共有耕畜七十万零七千多头，到今年11月底死掉十五万头（包括部分合理淘汰的老畜）。加上一年来繁殖和从外地购买的七万头，全专区现有耕畜仅六十二万七千多头。另据各县统计，现有耕畜中还有十万头左右，因严重瘦弱难于过冬，在12月上旬的十天内就死掉一万多头。同时，牲畜的配种、繁殖也逐年减少。今年全专区共繁殖幼畜二万头，比去年减少40％。因为牲畜减少，今年平均每付牛犋负担的耕地已由去年的七十亩左右增加到八十多亩。有的县在种植小麦时，因为畜力不足，只好组织人力拉耧播种。许多农业社也不得不变双轮双铧犁为单铧犁。
    会议在分析造成这种情况的原因时认为，除去耕畜折价入社时评价偏低以外，目前农业社在牲畜的管理方面还存在着许多急待解决的问题。如对饲养员选拔和教育重视不够；大部分社还缺少一套完整的包工包养和对耕畜使用、管理和繁殖的制度；随着合作社的扩大，社内饲养设备较差，集中喂养牲畜增加了管理上的困难等等，都会造成耕畜的病弱和死亡。
    为了迅速扭转这种情况，会议提出，当前每个合作社都应立即把现有的牲畜进行一次排队，病畜要分喂，因使用和喂养不当造成的瘦弱耕畜，要指定专人喂养，并且增加一些饲料。凡是集中喂养牲畜的社，能增添设备的立即增添设备，没有能力增添设备的坚决分散喂养。当前没有饲料的应该迅速从社的存粮或供销社掌握的油饼中拿出一部分来，并且积极做好饲草、饲料的规划，争取做到所有耕畜安全过冬。
    会议还要求各农业社要结合冬季生产和民主整社，系统地总结一年来对牲畜包工包养的经验和教训。提倡牲畜包养到队，改变大社专设饲养队的做法。每个社要制定一套包括饲养、使役、兽医等相结合的牲畜管理和奖惩制度。对饲养员的选择，要注意饲养技术和政治条件，并经常对他们进行爱社、爱畜的教育，防止饲养员偷工、偷料和偷草的现象。对繁殖和增养幼畜的问题，各社也应做出具体规划，切实贯彻“自繁、自育、自用并使有余”的精神。
    会议还要求中共地委、县委的生产合作部门会同政府有关部门，具体掌握这项工作，定期向党委汇报情况。农业社也应有一个副社长管理这项工作。做到及时检查问题，解决问题。
    本报讯　山东广饶县各农业生产合作社，为保护牲口安全过冬，最近普遍进行了对耕畜饲养情况的深入检查，收效很大。
    入冬以来，有些农业社对保护耕畜过冬注意不够。中共广饶县委书记在李鹊区伴同区委书记亲自到十四个生产队去，看过十四处牲口栏，发现区里说牲口安全过冬没问题的情况，和事实不符。如吕明乡和平社二队，当时连栏棚也没有，七、八头牲口白天黑夜都拴在露天的院子里；光辉农业社第十队，两间小栏棚挤进了十八头牲口。广饶县委根据调查了解的情况，于12月19日召开的县委会上，专门讨论了保护耕畜过冬的问题，并在20日召开的区委书记会议上，把改进耕畜饲养管理，作为一项重要任务提了出来。最近，在全县范围内已较普遍地进行了冬季耕畜饲养情况的检查。检查的办法，一般都是组织本社各队的饲养员和社、队干部，共同深入到各个栏棚去看。有些社结合检查进行了群众性的参观评比，表扬了饲养管理搞得好的队，评选了模范饲养员，并进行了奖励。有的社还建立了改进饲养的制度。如泊西区三水农业社就由一个副社长专门负责领导喂养牲畜方面的事。这个社各队的饲养员五天开一次碰头会，共同讨论改进饲养问题，并经常进行互相参观检查。有的社调整了饲养员的力量，把社员中的热心勤劳能干的积极分子选当饲养员。
    把各队喂养的牲口，分散给社员负责喂养，乃是保护牲口安全过冬的有效办法。许多农业社采取了定草、定料、定膘、定粪、定工分等公私两利的合理办法，大大提高了社员喂养牲口的积极性。吕明乡一百五十头牲口，已有一百头被社员牵回家喂养了。光辉社第十队的十八头牲口，已经有十五头由社员分散喂养。社员说：“保证使牲口住处暖和、吃得舒坦、瘦不了。”  （肖彦）
