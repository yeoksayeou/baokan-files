U.S. Subversive Activities Against Indonesia
He Xin
    Not long ago, officials in Washington stated that the United States hoped for stability in Indonesia. However, the stark reality is that the United States has been conducting subversive activities against the Republic of Indonesia for many years.
    
    MacArthur's Image on Stamps
    In 1950, just as the Indonesian people were demanding to break free from the "divide and rule" trap arranged by the Dutch colonialists in the Hague Round Table Conference agreements, a rebel group in the Moluccas Islands declared the establishment of the pseudo "Republic of South Moluccas," claiming to secede from the Republic of Indonesia. This so-called "Republic of South Moluccas" was a tool for the Dutch colonialists to split the Republic of Indonesia. However, the United States also had connections with the so-called "Republic of South Moluccas." Indonesian newspapers published in Jakarta once printed a stamp of the pseudo "Republic of South Moluccas," which was printed in the United States and featured the image of the infamous American General MacArthur. From this, it is not difficult to see the clues between the United States and this illegal organization. According to the confession of Werissa, the so-called Prime Minister of the pseudo "Republic of South Moluccas," who was arrested by the Indonesian government, one of the rebel group leaders, Sumokil, had suggested leasing the port of Makassar in Sulawesi Island to the American military delegation for 13 million guilders per year in exchange for funds for illegal activities.
    
    Clearly, the United States, taking advantage of the young Republic of Indonesia's newly gained independence, harbored ambitious attempts to interfere in Indonesia and expand American colonialist influence.
    
    From Sea to Sky
    In July 1953, following the fall of the Wilopo cabinet, the first Ali Sastroamidjojo cabinet was formed. Because this cabinet implemented some measures conducive to consolidating Indonesian independence, it was opposed by American and Dutch imperialism. Consequently, the various rebel groups that already existed within the Republic of Indonesia intensified their anti-government activities, among which the illegal activities of the "Darul Islam" movement and its armed "Indonesian Islamic Army" were particularly rampant. This armed rebel group, cloaked in religious garb, engaged in rebellion in the West Java area, carrying out arson, killings, looting, and disrupting social order.
    
    The "Darul Islam" movement and its armed "Indonesian Islamic Army," a terrorist group declared an enemy of the Republic by the first Ali Sastroamidjojo cabinet, not only received support from the Dutch colonialists but also colluded with American imperialism. The United States supplied this terrorist group with weapons from the sea to the sky, allowing it to engage in subversive activities. According to Manok, a witness in the Jongklaus subversive activities case (who served as a senior officer under Jongklaus), the arms of the "Darul Islam" movement and the "Indonesian Islamic Army" came from Singapore, and "these arms were shipped in by (American) General Motors ships disguised as throwing garbage into the sea." Manok had airdropped weapons and food to rebels operating in Java and Sumatra twelve times in 1952 and 1953, including "two airdrops carried out by a man named Kenneth piloting a C-47 aircraft belonging to the American Embassy." He also went to the American Embassy in Indonesia to collect funds for activities.
    
    Because the first Ali Sastroamidjojo cabinet pursued an active, neutral foreign policy and refused to participate in the military aggression organizations cobbled together by the United States, the United States regarded the first Ali Sastroamidjojo cabinet as a thorn in its side, always wanting to strangle it with its sinful, bloody hands. The most obvious fact is that former Deputy Army Chief of Staff Lubis, taking advantage of his position as Acting Army Chief of Staff, openly defied the orders of the central government and refused to hand over military power to the newly appointed Army Chief of Staff Utoyo, creating the so-called "Army Affair," forcing the first Ali Sastroamidjojo cabinet to resign. Everyone knows that Lubis's backer was the American. This government crisis was the most shameless manifestation of the United States using reactionaries to carry out subversive activities against Indonesia.
    
    Lubis and Simbolon Group: The Man Behind the Scenes
    Because the democratic forces in Indonesia achieved a significant victory in the 1955 general election, the parliament produced by the first general election last March was declared established. At the same time, the second Ali Sastroamidjojo cabinet was formed. This cabinet more resolutely implemented an independent and autonomous foreign policy and, in accordance with the spirit of the Asian-African Conference resolutions, implemented a policy of friendly cooperation with all countries. Consequently, imperialism tried every possible means to overthrow the Ali government in order to change the current diplomatic direction of the Indonesian government. The events of former Deputy Army Chief of Staff Lubis attempting to launch a military coup three times last year and the rebellion recently launched by former First Military District Commander Simbolon in North Sumatra to secede from the central government are the most powerful proof.
    
    Indonesian newspapers pointed out that the United States is the man behind the Lubis-Simbolon group.
    
    As early as last September, when Allen Dulles, Director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, visited Jakarta, he held talks with Lubis and gave Lubis several million dollars. And when Lubis attempted to launch a military coup for the third time on November 15th and 16th last year, the personnel of the American Embassy were unusually not going out, which was definitely not accidental.
    
    The Indonesian Nationalist Party's official newspaper, "Indonesian Torch," once accused the United States of using private foundations ("The Asia Foundation" is one of them) to assist the activities of reactionaries attempting to overthrow the government due to the United States' dissatisfaction with the results of the Indonesian general election, and of inciting local sentiments in Indonesia in order to create antagonistic sentiments between various ethnic groups. The North Sumatra incident proves this accusation.
    
    During Simbolon's coup in North Sumatra, a plane belonging to American veteran officer Chennault landed in North Sumatra. The uninvited guests on the plane promised to help Simbolon, on the condition of protecting American oil interests in North Sumatra. At the same time, according to a report in the Indonesian "Independent Daily": The American side seemed pleased about the military rebellion that occurred in Sumatra and believed that it brought good "hope" to the United States. As this newspaper pointed out: The voice of Washington is exactly the same as the voice of the opposition here.
    
    When Simbolon failed in his rebellion, he contacted the American Mobil Oil Company based in Sumatra, asking the company to help him escape to a foreign country.
    
    The American propaganda machine also played a despicable role in the North Sumatra incident. The Indonesian government condemned the distorted reports and commentaries by the American Associated Press and certain Western newspapers and radio stations regarding the events that occurred in Indonesia. The news and commentaries of these newspapers and news agencies regarding the Indonesian government no longer being able to control the situation in Central Sumatra and North Sumatra were contrary to the facts. The Indonesian government believes that foreign countries are systematically conducting this propaganda through newspapers and radio stations, and they are using every opportunity related to the domestic situation in Indonesia to attack the Indonesian government.
    
    Since Indonesian independence, the United States has been relentlessly creating trouble in Indonesia and engaging in despicable subversive activities. However, their efforts are in vain. The Indonesian people have already seen through that this "evil bird" of American imperialism will only harm Indonesia's beautiful garden and will not bring any benefits.

    美国对印度尼西亚的颠覆活动
    何辛
    不久以前，华盛顿的官员曾表示说，美国希望印度尼西亚的局势能够稳定。但是，赤裸裸的事实是：多年来，美国一直对印度尼西亚共和国进行颠覆活动。
    邮票上的麦克阿瑟像
    1950年，正当印度尼西亚人民要求摆脱荷兰殖民者在海牙圆桌会议协定中安排下的分而治之的圈套的时候，叛乱集团在摩鹿加群岛宣布了伪“南摩鹿加共和国”的成立，声明脱离印度尼西亚共和国。这个所谓“南摩鹿加共和国”，是荷兰殖民者分裂印度尼西亚共和国的工具。但，美国和所谓“南摩鹿加共和国”也有关系。雅加达出版的印度尼西亚报纸曾刊登了伪“南摩鹿加共和国”的一种邮票，这种邮票是在美国印制的，上面有恶名远扬的美国将军麦克阿瑟的像。由此不难看出美国和这个非法组织之间的蛛丝马迹。据被印度尼西亚政府逮捕的伪“南摩鹿加共和国”所谓总理韦理萨尔招供，叛乱集团首领之一苏莫尔基曾献计：把在苏拉威斯岛的望加锡港口以每年一千三百万盾租给美国军事代表团，以换取进行非法活动的经费。
    很显然，美国趁着年轻的印度尼西亚共和国刚刚独立的时候，便野心勃勃地企图插足印度尼西亚，扩张美国的殖民主义势力。
    从海洋到天空
    1953年7月，继韦洛坡内阁倒台后，第一届阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁成立。由于这届内阁施行了一些有利于巩固印度尼西亚独立的措施，因此遭到美荷帝国主义的敌视。于是，早已存在于印度尼西亚共和国内部的各种叛乱集团变本加厉地进行反政府的活动，其中“伊斯兰教国运动”及其武装“印度尼西亚伊斯兰教军”的非法活动，尤为猖獗。这个武装叛乱集团披着宗教外衣，在西爪哇一带进行叛变活动，并且大肆烧杀劫掠，破坏社会秩序。
    “伊斯兰教国运动”及其武装“印度尼西亚伊斯兰教军”，这个被第一届阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁宣布为共和国的敌人的恐怖集团，除了得到荷兰殖民者的撑腰外，与美帝国主义也有勾结。美国曾经从海洋到天空供给这个恐怖集团武器，让它从事颠覆活动。据荷兰特务荣格拉斯颠覆活动案的证人马诺克（他在荣格拉斯部下当过高级军官）揭露：“伊斯兰教国运动”和“印度尼西亚伊斯兰教军”的军火来自新加坡，而“这些军火是由假装在海中抛垃圾的（美国）通用汽车公司的船运进的”。马诺克在1952年和1953年曾十二次空投武器和粮食给在爪哇和苏门答腊活动的叛乱分子，其中“有两次空投是由一名叫肯尼特的人驾驶美国大使馆的C—47型飞机进行的”。他还到过美国驻印度尼西亚大使馆领取活动经费。
    由于第一届阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁执行积极的、中立的外交政策，拒绝参加美国拼凑的军事侵略组织，因此，美国把第一届阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁视为眼中钉，时刻想用罪恶的血手扼杀它。最明显的事实是：前陆军副参谋长卢比斯利用他担任代理陆军参谋长的机会，公然抗拒中央政府的命令，拒绝把军权交给新任的陆军参谋长乌多约，而制造了所谓“陆军事件”，迫使第一届阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁辞职，大家知道，卢比斯的后台老板是美国佬。这次政府危机，是美国利用反动派对印度尼西亚进行颠覆活动的最无耻的表现。
    卢比斯和西姆波朗集团幕后的拉线人
    由于印度尼西亚民主力量在1955年普选中取得重大的胜利，去年3月第一次普选后产生的国会宣告成立。同时，组成了第二届阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁。这届内阁更加坚决地执行独立自主的外交政策，并根据亚非会议决议的精神，实行与各国友好合作的政策。于是，帝国主义更是千方百计地企图推翻阿里政府，以改变印度尼西亚政府现行的外交路线。前陆军副参谋长卢比斯去年曾先后三次企图发动军事政变的事件，和不久前在北苏门答腊发生的前第一军区司令西姆波朗策动的脱离中央的叛变事件，就是最有力的证明。
    印度尼西亚报纸指出：美国是卢比斯—西姆波朗集团的幕后拉线人。
    早在去年9月，美国中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯到雅加达时，曾与卢比斯举行会谈，并且给了卢比斯几百万美元。而在去年11月15、16两天，卢比斯企图第三次发动军事政变时，美国大使馆人员反常地都不外出，这绝对不是偶然的。
    印度尼西亚国民党机关报“印度尼西亚火炬报”曾指责过，由于美国对印度尼西亚普选结果的不满，而利用私人基金会（“亚洲基金会”就是其中之一）来协助反动派企图推翻政府的活动，并且煽起印度尼西亚的地方情绪，以引起各民族间的对立情绪。北苏门答腊事件证明了这个指责。
    西姆波朗在北苏门答腊发动政变期间，一架属于美国退伍军官陈纳德的飞机曾在北苏门答腊降落，飞机上的不速之客答应帮助西姆波朗，条件是保护美国在北苏门答腊的石油利益。同时，据印度尼西亚“独立报”的报道：美国方面对苏门答腊所发生的军事叛变似乎感到高兴，并且认为这给美国带来了良好的“希望”。正如这家报纸指出的：华盛顿的声音和这里反对派的声音一模一样。
    当西姆波朗因叛变失败后，他与设在苏门答腊的美国美孚油公司取得联系，要求这个公司帮助他逃到外国。
    美国宣传机器，在北苏门答腊事件中，也起了卑鄙的作用。印度尼西亚政府曾谴责美国合众社以及西方国家某些报纸和电台关于印度尼西亚所发生的事件的歪曲报道和评论，这些报纸和通讯社关于印度尼西亚政府不再能控制中苏门答腊和北苏门答腊局势的消息和评论是违反事实的。印度尼西亚政府认为：外国有计划地通过报纸和电台进行这些宣传，他们利用有关印度尼西亚国内局势的每个机会来打击印度尼西亚政府。
    印度尼西亚独立以来，美国就是这样不放松一点机会在印度尼西亚兴风作浪，进行卑鄙的颠覆活动。但是，他们的努力是徒劳的。印度尼西亚人民已经看透了美帝国主义这只“恶鸟”只会危害印度尼西亚美丽的花园，而不会带来什么好处。
