    Currently, many agricultural cooperatives are summarizing their production achievements from last year and studying their production plans for this year. How to correctly learn from the experiences and lessons of last year's agricultural planning work, combine it with rectification and preparation for farming, and make this year's production plan well, so that it can play a greater guiding role, is an important task in agricultural production leadership at present.
    At the beginning of last year, in the high tide of agricultural cooperation, all regions formulated agricultural production plans (some even formulated long-term plans) based on the new situation after the change of production relations and the requirements of the peasant masses for further development of production, stipulating production increase targets, planting plans, and measures to achieve the plans. This played a huge role in breaking down conservative ideas, inspiring the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses for increasing production, tapping agricultural production potential, and ensuring the completion of production increase tasks. This should be affirmed.
    However, because the foundation of our country's agricultural planning work is still very weak, leadership experience is insufficient, and agricultural cooperatives still lack the habit of planned production, some problems have also occurred in many regions when formulating and implementing plans. For example, some production increase targets were too high, there were too many planned projects, and the leadership's control was too strict. In some places, the grain and cotton production increase targets were unrealistically several times higher than the existing level, and agricultural cooperatives were rigidly required to implement such plans. This has limited the agricultural cooperatives' flexibility and the peasants' initiative. Some agricultural cooperatives, in order to achieve excessively high targets, promoted certain technical reform measures too much and too hastily, violating the principle of adapting to local conditions. Some agricultural cooperatives organized labor and formulated budgets based on unrealistic plans, resulting in excessive labor tension and financial planning chaos.
    The planning of agricultural production is an integral part of the country's planned economic construction. It is necessary to propose agricultural production development targets from top to bottom. However, if these targets are not combined with bottom-up planning and do not leave appropriate room for maneuver for the lower levels, it will be difficult to conform to the local actual conditions. If excessively high plan targets are forcibly implemented, it will promote the growth of commandism among subordinates. Especially since the natural conditions in various regions are very complex and the peasants' demands are diverse, it will certainly not work if the planting area and production quantity are determined rigidly without soliciting the opinions of lower-level cadres and peasants and without going through discussions among cooperative members. The phenomenon of blind reform of the farming system leading to reduced production in many places last year was inseparable from this practice of allocating planting areas and plans from top to bottom too rigidly.
    A correct plan should be advanced and fully reliable. A plan that is advanced but unreliable will inevitably lose its guiding role in production; a plan that is reliable but not advanced cannot tap production potential and promote production development. Therefore, when formulating plans, there must be an objective and comprehensive analysis of the actual situation. It is necessary to estimate both favorable conditions and difficult conditions; it is necessary to see both the current situation and estimate possible new situations; at the same time, it is also necessary to consider the interrelationship between various conditions and various factors. The reason why some agricultural cooperatives' plans were unrealistic last year was not because they were completely without basis, but because these bases were not comprehensive and not completely reliable.
    In order to prepare the production plan of the agricultural cooperative well, the cooperative cadres must follow the mass line, mobilize the cooperative members to sum up experiences and lessons, and make the production plan completely conform to the principle of adapting to local conditions. The county and township party and government leading cadres should give specific assistance to the agricultural cooperative, so that the agricultural cooperative's plan can both obey the needs of the state plan and give full play to the local production potential. Since the specific conditions of each agricultural cooperative are different, their production plans should also be different, and absolutely no uniform requirements should be put forward.
    Some places, because the plan targets set in the spring of last year were too high, dare not propose advanced targets this year, so that the new plan is too conservative. Although this deviation is only in its infancy, it is very worthy of attention. The Party and the people demand that the plan be set neither conservatively nor excessively high, so that it is not easy for those who do not produce actively to reach the quota, while those who produce actively can reach or exceed the quota. Such a plan will stimulate the enthusiasm of cooperative members and truly play a guiding role in production.
    The state's agricultural plan and the agricultural production cooperative's plan must be combined with each other according to the specific conditions of various places. When the state plan was issued, some places in Hubei adopted the following method: only assigning the task of purchasing and acquiring agricultural products to the agricultural cooperatives, and under the premise of completing agricultural tax and unified purchase tasks of agricultural products and fulfilling the contractual obligations signed with the state purchasing departments and commercial departments, the agricultural cooperatives could arrange production according to the local conditions and their own needs. The production plan was issued to the county and district-township, which was controlled by the district-township and not issued to the cooperatives. After the township "collides" the upper and lower plans, if they are roughly the same, they can be implemented accordingly; if the execution cannot be guaranteed, further consultation and adjustment are required. The cooperative cadres welcomed this method, saying: "This can only be adapted to local conditions." This method can be used as a reference for various places.
    Judging from the implementation of the plan in various places last year, the central link in appropriately combining the state plan and the agricultural cooperative's plan lies in the county. Because the state's plan and requirements must be issued to the county through the province and prefecture, and the agricultural cooperative's plan must be converged to the county, which is controlled and comprehensively balanced by the county. The county-level leading organs have the responsibility and the possibility to ensure the completion of the state plan according to the requirements of the state and the local situation, ensure the independence of the cooperative's operation, and combine the upper and lower levels to gradually bring the agricultural cooperative's production into the orbit of the state plan.
    The county directly controls the grass-roots organizations. If it can strictly follow the principle of combining the upper-level plan with the local situation, and actively and responsibly reflect the situation and provide opinions to the upper level, and revise inappropriate plans, it can avoid mistakes and reduce losses.
    After a year of practice, the agricultural cooperatives in various places have accumulated a lot of experience in formulating and implementing agricultural production plans. The planning departments and agricultural leading departments at all levels have also proposed some measures to improve agricultural planning work. The control figures for agricultural production in various provinces issued by the State Council this year have also been greatly simplified. This will give the lower levels greater flexibility. As long as all localities make full use of these favorable conditions, they will be able to make this year's agricultural production plan better.

### 订好今年的农业计划

    订好今年的农业计划
    目前许多农业合作社正在总结去年的生产成绩，研究今年的生产计划。怎样正确地接受去年农业计划工作中的经验教训，结合整社、备耕工作，把今年的生产计划作好，使它发挥更大的指导作用，是当前农业生产领导上的一个重要任务。
    去年年初，在农业合作化高潮中，各个地区都根据生产关系变化以后的新情况和农民群众进一步发展生产的要求，制定了农业生产计划（有的还制定了远景规划），规定了增产指标、种植计划和实现计划的措施。这对于打破保守思想，鼓舞干部和群众的增产热情，发掘农业生产潜力，保证增产任务的完成，起了巨大的作用。这是应该加以肯定的。
    但是，由于我国农业计划工作的基础还很薄弱，领导经验不足，农业社也还缺乏计划生产的习惯，不少地区在编制和执行计划的时候，也发生了一些毛病。比如，有的增产指标过高，计划项目过多，领导控制过死。有些地方的粮棉增产指标不切实际地高出现有水平好几倍，并且硬性地要求农业社执行这种计划。这就限制了农业社的机动性和农民的主动性。有些农业社为了实现过高的指标，就过多过急地推行某项技术改革措施，违背了因地制宜的原则。有些农业社根据不切实际的计划组织劳动力，制定预算，以致造成劳动过度紧张和财务计划混乱的现象。
    农业生产的计划化，是国家有计划的经济建设的一个组成部分。从上而下地提出农业生产发展指标是必要的。但是，这种指标如果不同自下而上的计划相结合，不给下面留出适当的机动余地，就很难符合当地的实际情况。如果勉强执行过高的计划指标，就会助长下级的命令主义作风的滋长。尤其是各个地区的自然条件很复杂，农民的要求多种多样，如果不征求下级干部和农民的意见，不经过社员讨论，就把播种面积、生产数量定的死死板板，那一定行不通。去年不少地方所以发生盲目改革耕作制度因而减产的现象，和这种自上而下地分配播种面积、计划太过于死板的作法是分不开的。
    正确的计划应该是先进的和充分可靠的。先进而不可靠的计划，必然失去指导生产的作用；可靠而不先进的计划，也不能发掘生产潜力和促进生产的发展。因此，在编制计划的时候，对实际情况必须有客观、全面的分析。既要估计到有利条件，也要估计到困难条件；既要看到当前的情况，也要估计到可能发生的新情况；同时还要考虑到各种条件和各种因素之间的相互联系。去年有些农业社的计划订的不切实际，并不是因为完全没有根据，而是因为这些根据不全面和不完全可靠。
    为了编好农业社的生产计划，社干部必须走群众路线，发动社员总结经验教训，使生产计划完全符合因地制宜的原则。县、乡党政领导干部要给农业社以具体的帮助，使农业社的计划既能服从国家计划的需要，又能充分发挥当地的生产潜力。由于各个农业社的具体条件不同，它们的生产计划也应有所不同，绝不应该提出千篇一律的要求。
    有些地方因为去年春季订的计划指标过高，今年也就不敢提出先进的指标，以致新的计划又过于保守了。这种偏差虽然只是萌芽状态，但是非常值得注意。党和人民要求把计划定得既不保守又不过高，要使不积极生产的不容易达到定额，而积极生产的能够达到或超过定额。这样的计划才会刺激社员的劳动积极性，真正发挥指导生产的作用。
    国家的农业计划和农业生产合作社的计划必须按照各地的具体情况，使它们互相结合起来。湖北有些地方在国家计划下达的时候，采取了这样的作法：对农业社只下达农产品的征购和收购任务，农业社在完成农业税和农产品统购任务、履行同国家采购部门和商业部门订立的合同义务的前提下，可以按照当地的情况和自己的需要安排生产。生产计划下达到县和区乡，由区乡掌握，不下达到社。乡把上下计划“碰头”之后，如果大致相符，就可以照此执行；如果不能保证执行，再行协商调整。社干部很欢迎这个办法，他们说：“这才能因地制宜。”这种作法可供各地参考。
    从去年各地执行计划的情况来看，要把国家计划和农业社的计划适当地结合，中心环节在于县。因为国家的计划和要求，要经过省和专区下达到县，农业社的计划要汇合到县，由县掌握，综合平衡。县级领导机关有责任也有可能按照国家的要求和当地的情况，保证国家计划的完成，保证合作社经营的独立性，上下结合起来，把农业社的生产逐步纳入国家计划的轨道。
    县是直接掌握基层组织的，它如果能够严格地按照上级计划和本地情况相结合的原则，积极负责地向上级反映情况和提供意见，修改不适当的计划，就可以避免错误，减少损失。
    各地农业社经过一年的实践，已经积累了制定和执行农业生产计划的不少经验。各级计划部门和农业领导部门也提出了一些改善农业计划工作的措施。今年国务院下达的各省农业生产的控制数字，也大大简化了。这将给下边更大的灵活性。只要各地充分运用这些有利条件，就能把今年的农业生产计划订的更好些。
