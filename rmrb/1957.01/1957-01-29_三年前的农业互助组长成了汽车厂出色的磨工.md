    Former Agricultural Mutual Aid Team Leader Becomes Outstanding Grinder at Automobile Factory
    (Our report) Grinder Wang Zuoshan of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has repeatedly surpassed production quotas and is now working on the second quarter of 1958's production. By mid-December of last year, he had already completed the first quarter of 1958's work. In the advanced producer movement, he has been repeatedly awarded the glorious title of advanced producer for continuously improving production efficiency. He is never proud and always learns humbly, having successively improved eight operating methods and continuing to break production quotas. At the beginning of last year, he formulated a personal two-year plan; now, he has achieved his personal two-year plan ahead of schedule in just one year. He has been promoted from a third-grade worker to a fifth-grade worker and has honorably joined the Chinese Communist Party. Recently, he revised his personal plan, striving for even greater progress.
    More than three years ago, Wang Zuoshan was still a mutual aid team leader in the countryside. He voluntarily participated in the construction of the automobile factory. He learned technology quickly. In just two years, he mastered the technology of precision and complex centerless grinding. The first time he improved his operating method, he completed a year's production task in five months. People in the village were very happy to hear this news. (Zhou Jiping)

    三年前的农业互助组长成了汽车厂出色的磨工
    本报讯　第一汽车制造厂磨工王作山一再突破生产定额，现在正在干1958年第二季度的活。去年12月中旬，他已经干完1958年第一季度的活。他在先进生产者运动中，因为不断提高生产效率，数次获得先进生产者的光荣称号。他从不骄傲，一贯虚心学习，先后改进八种操作方法，继续突破生产定额。去年年初他曾经制订个人的两年规划；现在只用了一年时间，提前实现个人的两年规划。他已经由三级工提升为五级工，并且光荣地加入中国共产党。最近他又修改了个人规划，争取更大的进步。
    三年多以前，王作山还是农村里的一个互助组组长。他自愿参加汽车厂的建设。他学习技术很快。只用两年时间，就掌握了精密复杂的无心磨床加工的技术。他第一次改进操作方法，用五个月时间完成一年生产任务。村里人听到这个消息，都很高兴。　（周季平）
