    "May First" Agricultural Cooperative Club
    As agriculture embarks on collectivization and production is reasonably arranged, farmers have a certain amount of leisure time, and everyone's demand for cultural and recreational life is becoming more and more urgent. Many members feel that in addition to production and meetings, there should also be cultural activities every day. The "May First" Agricultural Cooperative Club in Wuling Township, Xianyang County, Shaanxi Province, was established according to the demands of the masses. During breaks, some members play instruments, some sing, some read books, and some play ball.
    The "May First" Cooperative Club has drama groups, singing groups, dance groups, bands, creation groups, a library, radio listening groups, newspaper reading groups, sports groups, etc., and the club is also responsible for the cooperative's literacy school work. These things are all done by the masses themselves. They compose and sing their own songs, collectively create "Introduction to High-Yield Experience" (clapper talk drama), "Four Daughters Visit Their Parents for the New Year" (Meihu Opera), as well as many dances, comic dialogues, etc. The cooperative's public welfare fund is small, so the members use voluntary labor to raise funds. When it is time to perform, they invite nearby schools and factories to help rehearse and teach dance. Many of the musical instruments and dance costumes they use are borrowed from Zhouling Middle School and Northwestern Polytechnical University.
  　The club's recreational activities in spare time not only do not affect production, but also promote production. In the past, women here did not go to the fields often, they believed that "women are for taking care of children, sewing clothes, and cooking, going to the fields is a man's business." In response to this erroneous thinking, the club compiled and performed the play "Qingmei Ploughs the Field," and also invited Lu Guilan, director of the Five-Star Agricultural Cooperative, to give a special report, which stimulated women's enthusiasm for production.

    The club's band can already play Qinqiang, Meihu Opera, and many Northwest folk tunes.
    People who were illiterate before can now read scripts. These are several actors from the drama group reciting lines from the newly written song and dance drama "The Red Flag Flies Over the Northwest Plateau."
    The four daughters who collectively created the Meihu Opera "Four Daughters Visit Their Parents for the New Year" each bring a gift back to their parents' home. This is a scene from "Meeting on the Road." They sing: "The scenery is beautiful in the first month, the yangko drums sound everywhere..."
    The "May First" Cooperative also has fifty women who cannot leave home because they have children and cannot attend literacy school on time, so the club organizes them together and sends teachers to their homes to teach.

    The members' interest in current affairs is growing stronger and stronger. Every time the blackboard newspaper is not finished, people surround it.
    Arriving at the "May First" Cooperative, you can hear singing and laughter everywhere. Whether at home or on the road, they can't forget to sing a few lines, and even when drying cotton, they must accompany it with singing.
    The creation group used the royalties from collective creations to buy a radio, helping the club establish a radio listening group. They often have activities in places where members are concentrated and when members are taking a midday break.

    “五一”农业社俱乐部
    农业一走上合作化，生产有了合理的安排，农民就有了一定的业余时间，大家对文化娱乐生活的要求也越来越迫切了。不少社员感到一天除了生产、开会，还要有文化活动。陕西省咸阳县五陵乡的“五一”农业社的俱乐部，就是按照群众这样的要求建立起来的。在休息的时候，社员们有的拉、有的唱、有的看书、有的打球。
    “五一”社俱乐部里有戏剧组、歌咏组、舞蹈组、乐队、创作组、图书室、收听广播组、读报组、体育组等，俱乐部并负责全社的民校工作。这些事都是群众自己动手做的。他们自编自唱，集体创作出“丰产经验介绍”（快板剧）、“四女拜年”（郿鄠剧）以及很多舞蹈、相声等。社里的公益金不多，社员们就用义务劳动来筹集。当要演戏的时候，就请附近的学校和工厂来帮助排戏、教舞。他们用的许多乐器和舞衣，是从周陵中学和西北工学院借来的。
  　这个俱乐部在业余时间开展文艺活动，不但没有影响生产，反而推动了生产。过去这里的妇女下地不多，她们认为“妇女是看娃缝衣做饭，出门下地是男人的事”。俱乐部针对这种错误思想编演了“青梅犁地”一出戏，还请五星农业社主任鲁桂兰作了专题报告，激发了妇女生产的积极性。本报记者　朱波摄影
    俱乐部的乐队已经会演奏秦腔、郿鄠，以及很多西北民间曲子。
    以前不识字的人，现在都能读剧本了。这是戏剧组的几个演员在对新编的歌舞剧“红旗飘在西北高原上”的台词。
    集体创作郿鄠剧“四女拜年”的四女，每人带着一份礼物回娘家，这是“路遇”中的一个场面。她们唱道：“正月里来好风光，秧歌锣鼓到处响……”。
    五一”社还有五十个妇女因为有孩子离不开家，不能按时到民校上课，俱乐部就把她们组织在一起，派教员到她们家里去教课。
    六十七岁的老社员赵天培。他已借阅过七十多本书了。这是他和他的孙子们在看画报。
    社员们对时事的兴趣越来越浓厚，每次黑板报还没写完，人们就围上来了。
    来到了“五一”社，到处可以听到歌声和笑声。他们不管是在家里、路上，都忘不了唱几句，就是在晒棉花的时候，也要伴以歌声。
    创作组用集体创作的稿费买了一台收音机，帮助俱乐部建立起收音小组。在社员集中的地方和社员歇晌的时候经常有他们的活动。
