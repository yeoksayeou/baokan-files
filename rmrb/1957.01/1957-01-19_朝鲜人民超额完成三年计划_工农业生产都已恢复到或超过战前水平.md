Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 18th. "Labor News" in Korea published an article on the 17th by Nam In-ho, Deputy Chairman of the Korean State Planning Commission. This article stated that the Korean people have exceeded the three-year plan, with the total industrial output value exceeding the three-year plan by 23%. Agricultural production in 1956 also recovered to and surpassed pre-war levels.

The article stated that during the three-year plan from 1954 to 1956, the state invested a total of 79 billion won (Korean currency) in the people's economic sectors, of which 50% was invested in the industrial sector. By the end of 1956, approximately 240 heavy and light industrial enterprises had resumed production, and 70 new factories had been built. The total industrial output value in 1956 was twice that of 1949 and 2.9 times that of 1953.

Light industry has also been rapidly restored and developed. The production of consumer goods in 1956 reached 2.2 times that of 1949.

Investments in agriculture during the three years increased by more than 30% compared to the original plan. Over the past three years, more than 123,000 chongbo (one chongbo is approximately 15 mu) of cultivated land have been restored and expanded. By the end of last November, more than 15,600 agricultural producers' cooperatives had been established in North Korea, with participating farm households accounting for 79.3% of the total number of farm households.

The national income in 1956 reached 1.3 times that of 1949, or twice that of 1953. Over the three years, the retail prices of goods in state-owned stores were reduced by 45%, and wages were raised twice. The state invested 8.9 billion won in housing construction over the three years, constructing 4.94 million square meters of housing. In addition, education, culture, and healthcare facilities have also been restored and expanded. A primary compulsory education system was implemented starting in 1956, and the total number of students at all levels of schools in North Korea now accounts for 25% of the total population. The article pointed out that there are also some mistakes and difficulties and obstacles that must be overcome in the implementation of the three-year plan. For example, investments are dispersed, failing to maximize their economic effectiveness, equipment utilization rates are still relatively low, and potential has not been fully utilized; furthermore, the wounds of war in urban and rural areas have not been completely healed, and agriculture cannot fully meet the needs of grain and light industrial raw materials, and the production of consumer goods still lags behind the needs of the people, etc. The article stated that these difficulties are surmountable difficulties in the process of development.

The article concluded by saying that the Korean people will build on the achievements of the three-year plan and begin implementing the first five-year plan this year to achieve even greater victories.

    朝鲜人民超额完成三年计划
    工农业生产都已恢复到或超过战前水平
    新华社平壤18日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”17日发表了朝鲜国家计划委员会副委员长南仁镐的一篇文章。这篇文章说明朝鲜人民已经超额完成了三年计划，工业总产值超过三年计划的23％，1956年的农业生产也恢复到并且超过战前水平。
    文章说，在从1954年到1956年的三年计划期间，国家对人民经济部门共投资七百九十亿元（朝鲜币），其中50％投入了工业部门。到1956年年底为止，约有二百四十个重工业和轻工业企业恢复了生产，并且新建了七十个工厂。1956年的工业总产值等于1949年的两倍，等于1953年的二点九倍。
    轻工业也得到迅速的恢复和发展。1956年消费品的生产达到1949年的二点二倍。
    三年中对农业的投资比原订计划增加了30％以上。三年来恢复和扩大了十二万三千多町步（一町步约合十五市亩）的耕地面积。到去年11月底，朝鲜北部已经建立了一万五千六百多个农业生产合作社，参加的农户占农户总数的79.3％。
    1956年的国民收入达到1949年的一点三倍，或者是1953年的两倍。三年间国营商店商品的零售价格降低了45％，并且曾经两次提高工资。三年间国家对建设住宅的投资有八十九亿元，建设了四百九十四万平方公尺的住宅。另外教育、文化、保健设备也得到了恢复和扩充。从1956年开始实行了初级义务教育制，现在朝鲜北部各级学校的学生总数为人口总数的25％。文章指出，在执行三年计划中也存在着一些错误和必须克服的困难和障碍。例如投资分散，没有最大限度地发挥它的经济效用，设备利用率还比较低，潜力还没有充分发挥；又如城市和农村的战争创伤还没有完全恢复，农业方面还不能充分满足粮食和轻工业原料的需要，消费品的生产还落后于人民的需求等。文章说，这些困难都是在发展过程中的可以克服的困难。
    文章最后说，朝鲜人民将以三年计划的成就为基础，从今年开始执行第一个五年计划，进一步取得更大的胜利。
