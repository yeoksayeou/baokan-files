    Eleven Silk Banners
    Zhou Chengxin, Chinese People's Volunteers

    1956 has passed. On the snow-swept northern land of Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people together welcomed the arrival of the New Year. As we joyfully celebrate our seventh New Year after entering Korea, I think that our relatives in the motherland may be missing their children abroad even more as time goes by. My comrades and I want to send all our post-war life in Korea to our relatives in the motherland, but the children's heartfelt words are too numerous and we don't know what to say.

    A few days before the New Year, I heard in a division political department that they were studying the annual awards for some units that had made outstanding achievements in 1956. Among the units to be rewarded was a hygiene team that regularly cared for the Korean people, and the Korean people had given them as many as eleven silk banners!

    On a sunny day after a snowfall, a comrade from the division political department and I walked on the snow-frozen road to their station in Riam-ri, Yangdeok County, South Pyongan Province, to visit this hygiene team—the local Korean people call it "the hospital," but in reality it is just a hygiene team that can provide short-term treatment.

    Captain Ma Manchun, the military doctor of the team, warmly received us. When we asked him to talk about some materials about treating the Korean people, he smiled and said, "We have nothing special to talk about. After living in Korea for a long time, we have become more and more like family with the Korean people, and it is our duty to treat them!" After my repeated requests, he slowly said, "Then from what time should I start?" I said, "Just talk about the events of 1956!" Because I knew that even before and after the Korean armistice, the Korean people in the Tieyuan, Changfeng and Tushan County areas had called them the "Korean People's Clinic" in the Volunteers. At that time, this hygiene team had, while completing the treatment tasks for the troops, specially set up a clinic for the treatment of the Korean people, and received many seriously injured and sick people.

    Comrade Ma Manchun hesitated for a while and said, "Treating the masses is a part of our annual work plan. However, in the past year or two, as the health and medical work of the Korean government has gradually recovered and strengthened, most of the patients we receive here are infectious diseases or acute diseases, and many patients are sent here in extremely critical conditions." He opened his work notebook and calculated, saying, "Since the beginning of this year, we have received and treated 395 Korean patients, of whom 21 patients were rescued from the brink of death, 14 people had surgery here, and 27 people were hospitalized here."

    In his conversation, he mentioned many doctors and nurses who were enthusiastic about serving the masses, including a surgical military doctor named Zhao Shukai, who had performed countless operations for the Korean people over the years and had been awarded a third-class merit. We wanted to meet Comrade Zhao Shukai. He invited him in.

    Comrade Zhao Shukai is a lively and enthusiastic person. But when I asked about treating the Korean people, he always said that he did nothing, and that everyone worked together. Later, he told a few stories about treating the Korean people. In this short dispatch, I can only write about one of the stories he told.

    It was in the spring. One day, a seriously injured person was sent from Dongyang-ri, Yangdeok County, more than ten miles away from their station. He was Sun Shigen, a sixteen-year-old student at Yangdeok County No. 3 Middle School. The Korean child was picking firewood in the mountains when he picked up an explosive dropped by American aggressors from planes during the war. Both hands were seriously injured, his left eye was blown out, and his chest was also blown bloody. The injury was quite serious and life-threatening. His relatives and teachers decided to send him to the nearby Volunteers "hospital."

    At this time, Sun Shigen was in a state of "shock" (pseudo-death) due to excessive blood loss and serious injuries. The doctor on duty quickly reported to the team leader. Captain Ma Manchun ordered the nurse to disinfect and bandage him first, and then convened the doctors for a consultation. After research, it was decided to first rescue the patient from danger, and then close the pneumothorax, perform artificial respiration, oxygen inhalation, and administer cardiotonics. Before long, the child gradually woke up and began to improve.

    A day later, when the doctor examined the wound, he found that the wound had a foul odor and secretions. The doctor quickly ordered the laboratory technician to test the secretions and found that it was tetanus bacillus. According to the injury, tetanus antitoxin must be injected. However, this drug was no longer available in their unit. What to do? Tetanus must be treated immediately, and it develops quickly! The team leader immediately called the logistics hospital of the Volunteers for instructions. The superior immediately agreed to give the medicine and asked to send someone to pick it up immediately.

    It was snowing heavily at this time, and the ground was covered with three feet of snow. The car could no longer pass, but the medicine must be retrieved quickly. The pharmacist, Comrade Lin Hua, immediately requested to be sent to pick it up on horseback. With the approval of the leadership, he rode his horse through the heavy snow, traveling nearly a hundred miles back and forth in one day, and finally retrieved the medicine in time. After this rescue, although the child's condition gradually improved, due to excessive blood loss after the injury, the red blood cells in his body dropped to only 1.5 million per cubic millimeter (the normal person is 4 million to 5 million), and blood transfusions were needed quickly. Platoon leader Jia Weishan and squad leader Zhu Kaimo were willing to donate their own blood to save the Korean child. So, 150 cc of fresh blood was drawn from each of them and transfused to the child. The patient's red blood cells quickly rose to 3 million, and finally he was out of danger.

    This Korean child stayed here for thirty-one days. Although due to the severity of the injury, the child lost a left eye and a left arm, he was finally saved. When the child's grandmother and father led him out of the hospital, they were so excited that they shed tears. Little Sun Shigen also used his only right arm to salute the departing Volunteer uncles with the Young Pioneer salute.

    Comrade Zhao Shukai also told me many stories about the Korean patients who had been cured expressing their gratitude to them. In those stories, whether they repeatedly declined the gifts of thanks from the Korean people, or the exciting words spoken at the forums held when the patients were discharged from the hospital, or how many Korean friends they made, unfortunately I could not personally see or hear them. What I saw was only the eleven silk banners presented by the Korean people, shimmering with the light of Sino-Korean friendship, that Comrade Zhao Shukai finally led me to visit in their club. The senders written on those flags included several provinces and many counties.

    On the way back to the division headquarters in the moonlight, I silently savored Captain Ma Manchun's words: "After living in Korea for a long time, we have become more and more like family with the Korean people!"

    十一面锦旗
    中国人民志愿军某部　周诚信
    1956年过去了。在漫天风雪的朝鲜北部土地上，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民一道迎接了新的一年的到来。当我们怀着愉快的心情欢度入朝后第七个新年的时候，我想，祖国的亲人们，也许由于时间的增长，更加惦念着自己在国外的儿女。我和我的战友们，都想把我们在朝鲜战后生活的一切寄语祖国亲人，可是，儿女们的心肠话，千头万绪又不知该说些什么好。
    新年前几天，我在一个师政治部听见他们在研究给在1956年工作具有突出成绩的一些单位年终奖励。准备奖励的单位中，有一个经常关心朝鲜人民的卫生分队，光朝鲜人民送给他们的锦旗就有十一面！
    一个雪后的晴天，我和师政治部的一个同志踏着冰雪封冻的道路，到他们驻地平安南道阳德郡日岩里，访问了这个卫生分队——当地朝鲜人民都把它叫“医院”，实际上它只是一个能够进行短期治疗的卫生分队。
    分队的马满仓军医大尉热情地接待了我们。当我们要他谈些关于给朝鲜人民治病的材料时，他笑了笑说：“我们没有什么特殊的事好谈，在朝鲜住久了，和朝鲜人民越来越成了一家亲人，治点病是应该做的！”经我再三要求，他才慢慢地说：“那从什么时候的情况说起呢？”我说：“只谈谈1956年的事吧！”因为我知道远在朝鲜停战前后，铁原、长丰和兔山郡一带的朝鲜人民，曾经叫他们是志愿军中的“朝鲜人民诊疗处”。那时候，这个卫生分队就曾经在完成为部队治疗任务的同时，特别设立了为朝鲜人民治疗的门诊处，接收了许多较重的伤病员。
    马满仓同志迟疑了一会儿说：“给群众治病，这是我们全年工作规划的一个内容。不过，近一两年来，由于朝鲜政府卫生医疗工作逐渐恢复和加强了，我们这里接收治疗的病员大都是传染病或急性病，许多病人都是在极端危急的情况下，才送到这里来的。”他翻开自己的工作笔记本，计算了一下说：“今年以来，我们接收治疗的朝鲜病人有三百九十五人次，其中有二十一个病人是从死亡线上抢救过来的，有十四个人在这里动了手术，有二十七个人在这里住过院。”
    他在谈话里提到了许多个热心为群众服务的医生和护士，其中有一个名叫赵书魁的手术军医，他几年来已经给朝鲜人民动过无数次手术，曾经立过三等功。我们要见一见赵书魁同志。他把他请来了。
    赵书魁同志是一个性情活泼，对人热情的人。但是当我问起给朝鲜人民治病的事，他总说自己没有什么，都是大家一起作的。后来，他讲了几个给朝鲜人民治病的故事。在这篇短短的通讯里，我只能写出他所讲到的中间的一个。
    那还是春天的事。一天，从他们驻地十多里以外的阳德郡东阳里送来了一名重伤员，他是阳德郡第三中学十六岁的学生孙世根。这个朝鲜孩子是在山上拾柴禾时，拾了一颗美国侵略者在战时用飞机投下的爆炸物，双手负了重伤，左眼被炸裂了，胸部也炸得血肉模糊。伤势相当严重，有生命危险。他的亲人和老师决定把他送到临近的志愿军“医院”。
    这个时候，孙世根由于流血过多，伤势严重，呈现“休克”（假死）现象。值班医生很快报告给分队领导。马满仓大尉一面吩咐护士先行消毒和包扎，一面召集医生们进行会诊。经研究决定先抢救病人脱离危险状态，随即封闭气胸、实行人工呼吸，吸氧和打强心剂。不一会，孩子逐渐苏醒，开始好转。
    过了一天，医生检查伤口的时候，发现伤口有臭味，并有分泌物。医生连忙吩咐化验员对分泌物进行了化验，发现是破伤风菌，根据伤势必须注射破伤风血清。可是，这种药品在他们单位已经没有了，怎么办呢？破伤风不立即治疗，发展又是很快的呀！分队领导立即打电话向志愿军后勤医院请示，上级立即答应给药，并叫马上派人去取。
    这时正下大雪，平地积雪三尺，汽车已经不能通行了，但是，药品必须很快取回来。司药林华同志立即请求派他骑马去取，经领导上同意，他骑着马冒着大雪，一天内往返近百里，终于及时取回了药品。经过这一番抢救，孩子伤情虽然逐渐好转，但由于负伤后流血过多，体内红血球下降到每立方毫米只一百五十万个（正常人是四百万到五百万个），需要迅速输血。排长贾维山和班长朱开模都愿意献出自己的血来挽救朝鲜孩子。于是，从他们身上每人抽了一百五十西西鲜血输给了孩子。病人的红血球很快上升到三百万个，最后脱离了危险。
    这个朝鲜孩子在这里住了三十一天，虽然由于伤势严重，使得孩子失去了一只左眼和一只左臂；但是终于保全了生命。当孩子的祖母和父亲领着他出院的时候，他们激动得掉下了泪。孙世根小朋友也用自己仅有的一只右臂向送别的志愿军叔叔致少年团的敬礼。
    赵书魁同志还给我讲了许多关于被医好的朝鲜病人对他们表示感谢的故事。在那些故事里，不管是他们多次谢绝了朝鲜人民送来的答谢礼物，或者是病人在出院时所举行的座谈会上激动的话语，或者是他们交了多少个朝鲜朋友，可惜我都不能亲自看到听到，我所看到的，只是赵书魁同志最后领我去参观的、挂在他们俱乐部的那十一面朝鲜人民赠送的闪烁着中朝友谊光辉的锦旗。那些旗子上所写的下款包括了几个道（省）和许多个郡（县）。
    在踏着月色返回师部的路上，我默默地体味着马满仓大尉的那句话：“在朝鲜住得久了，和朝鲜人民越来越成了一家亲人！”
