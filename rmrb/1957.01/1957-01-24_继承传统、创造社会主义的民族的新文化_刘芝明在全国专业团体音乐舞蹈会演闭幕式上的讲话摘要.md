Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: Excerpts from a speech by Liu Zhiming, Vice Minister of Culture, at the closing ceremony of the National Professional Performing Arts Music and Dance Festival:

    Liu Zhiming first pointed out that music and dance workers should take inheriting tradition and creating a new socialist national culture as their task. He said that great achievements have been made in inheriting national heritage, processing, and adapting traditional dance programs in recent years. Traditional dance art needs to be processed and reorganized to be developed, and the creation of new dance programs can only have national style and national characteristics on the basis of better inheriting tradition.

    Liu Zhiming said: To build a socialist new national culture on the basis of inheriting national music and dance art, we must learn from the West, and inevitably involve the question of how to correctly learn from foreign methods and experiences that are beneficial to us. From the overall trend of this performance, everyone is creating on the basis of inheriting and developing national traditions, but individual programs also have the phenomenon of mechanically copying foreign things. This is poor absorption, but it cannot be concluded that learning from foreign things is unnecessary. The reason why our song and dance cause can achieve such great gains in just a few years is inseparable from learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democratic countries in the construction of song and dance.

    Liu Zhiming expressed his opinions on the creative ideas and methods of music and dance. He said that it can be seen from this performance that most dancers and musicians are using the guiding ideology of reflecting reality more widely and expressing the thoughts and feelings of the masses of people more truthfully and typically, so as to achieve the purpose of inspiring and educating the people to move forward.

    Liu Zhiming said that in line with the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," we should further promote free competition among various schools of creative methods. Any creative method that is conducive to the healthy development of the people's music and dance cause will inevitably be welcomed by the masses of the people. It can be seen from the performance that many works created with the method of socialist realism are mostly very successful, which is enough to prove the advancement of this creative method. However, this is not the only creative method.

    He said: Through this performance, it can also be seen that the construction of dance theory in our country is still far behind creation. In order to better prosper creation, it is necessary to raise the issue of strengthening theoretical construction at present. The experience in all aspects needs to be summarized in time so that it can play an active guiding role in future work. Problems existing in creation, performance, and actor training need to be freely discussed to find solutions. Criticism of works is also needed, but the purpose of criticism is to prosper creation. Therefore, critics and those being criticized are required to have a realistic spirit and an attitude of studying problems so as to achieve the purpose of promoting creation.

    Liu Zhiming said: Our various fraternal nationalities have very rich song and dance art culture, which is an important part of the culture and art of our great motherland. We should actively encourage Han cadres to carry out the work of sorting out and adapting the dances of fraternal nationalities. On the one hand, we should assist fraternal nationalities in developing their own national dances, and on the other hand, we should introduce the lives of minority nationalities to the broad masses through the form of dance art, so as to play the role of cultural exchange between nationalities. In recent years, no small achievements have been made in this area, and they have been warmly welcomed by fraternal nationalities. However, due to the frivolous creative attitude of some art workers, phenomena that do not conform to the reality of life and destroy the characteristics of national style have appeared in some fraternal nationalities' dance works that have been sorted out or adapted, and this frivolous attitude should be changed. We cannot isolate the dance forms of fraternal nationalities from their national life, customs, and habits, and we cannot treat the dance vocabulary of fraternal nationalities as pure materials for processing without analysis. First of all, we must love the lives of fraternal nationalities, and we must be familiar with the historical life, thoughts, feelings, and customs of fraternal nationalities. We must process on the basis of being loyal to the tradition of fraternal nationalities' dances and maintaining the original style and characteristics. In the process of processing, we must obtain the close cooperation of the people and folk artists or professional art workers of this nationality, respect their opinions, and rely on their help to complete it. The criteria for judging the quality of the processed dances of fraternal nationalities should be based on the preferences of fraternal nationalities (this nationality), and we must resolutely prevent the practice of replacing the aesthetic views of fraternal nationalities with the author's own preferences. The processed dances of fraternal nationalities should strive to be tested in their own national areas. The key to prospering and developing the music and dance cause of fraternal nationalities lies in cultivating art cadres of fraternal nationalities themselves. We should vigorously help cadres of fraternal nationalities to sort out, process, and develop the music and dance of their own nationalities, and we should learn from each other with an open mind.

    Liu Zhiming said: Judging from the programs in this performance, although the number of works reflecting real life accounts for a large proportion, the content and themes are not wide enough, and the ideological nature of the works should be further strengthened. He said that with the diversification of themes, the form must also be diversified. We should further develop various different forms such as dance dramas, song and dance, group dances, etc., and we should also make various new attempts. He believes that when requiring the ideological nature of works, the characteristics, strengths, and limitations of dance art should be taken into account. It cannot be equated with literary or drama art. However, dance art workers should further fully utilize the characteristics of dance art to achieve the purpose of inspiring and educating the people to move forward.

    Liu Zhiming pointed out: Some programs in this performance have neglected the role of inspiring and educating the people that dance works should have because the authors paid too much attention to form, resulting in phenomena such as unclear themes, indistinct love and hate, and insubstantial content. It is very necessary to put more effort into the form in order to better express the content, but the form is, after all, a means of expressing the content, and more attention should be paid to how to express the theme content accurately and completely through the form. In addition, some works have generalized phenomena in the handling of form and content (including characters) because the authors and actors do not go deep enough into life and the people, only see some superficial phenomena, and do not grasp the most essential things in life, and do not conduct multi-faceted and in-depth analysis and research on traditional forms, and then develop them according to their own imagination, resulting in a lack of moving power. He said: The key to overcoming the shortcomings of generalization is to go deep into life and the masses. The authors and actors themselves must also have keen insight into life and correct methods of analysis, and secondly, they should also give play to their own unique creativity.

    In his speech, Liu Zhiming finally asked all professional groups to go deep into the folk and into life, earnestly learn traditional performing skills; strengthen ties with the local masses, attach importance to guiding mass amateur art activities, absorb nourishment from the masses, and gradually form their own style and characteristics. He also called for implementing the policy of running the troupe diligently and thriftily, and advocating methods that spend less money and have good results.

    继承传统、创造社会主义的民族的新文化
    ——刘芝明在全国专业团体音乐舞蹈会演闭幕式上的讲话摘要——
    新华社23日讯　文化部副部长刘芝明在全国专业团体音乐舞蹈会演闭幕式上的讲话摘要：
    刘芝明首先指出，音乐、舞蹈工作者应以继承传统、创造社会主义的民族的新文化为自己的任务。他说，这几年来在继承民族遗产、加工改编传统舞蹈节目方面取得了很大成就。传统的舞蹈艺术需要经过加工、整理才能发展，新的舞蹈节目的创作，也只有在更好地继承传统的基础上才能具有民族风格、民族特色。
    刘芝明说：我们要在继承民族的音乐舞蹈艺术的基础上，建设社会主义的民族的新文化，就必然要借鉴西洋，必然要牵涉到如何正确地学习外国那些对我们有益的方法和经验的问题。这次会演，从总的倾向来看，大家都是在继承和发展民族传统的基础上进行创作的，但个别节目也存在生硬搬用外来东西的现象。这是吸收得不好，但不能因此而认为学习外国东西要不得。我们的歌舞事业所以能在短短几年内获得如此巨大的收获是和学习苏联以及东欧人民民主国家在歌舞建设事业上的先进经验分不开的。
    刘芝明对音乐、舞蹈的创作思想和方法发表了意见。他说，从这次会演中可以看出大部分舞蹈家、音乐家是以更广泛地反映现实，更真实地、典型地表现人民群众的思想感情作为他们创作的主导思想，因而就达到鼓舞和教育人民前进的目的。
    刘芝明说，本着“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，我们要进一步提倡各种流派的创作方法展开自由竞赛。任何创作方法，只要有利于人民的音乐舞蹈事业健康发展，必然会获得人民群众的欢迎。从会演中看到有许多以社会主义现实主义方法创作的作品，大多都很成功，这也足以证明这一创作方法的先进性。但是，这并不是唯一的创作方法。
    他说：通过这次会演，也可以看到我国舞蹈理论的建设工作还远远落在创作后面。为了更好地繁荣创作，就有必要在目前提出加强理论建设工作的问题。各方面的经验需要及时加以总结。使它对今后的工作能起积极的指导作用。在创作、表演、演员培养等方面存在的问题，需要展开自由讨论，寻求解决办法。对作品也需要展开批评工作，但批评的目的是为了繁荣创作，因此要求批评者与被批评者，要有实事求是的精神和研究问题的态度，这样才能达到推动创作的目的。
    刘芝明说：我国各兄弟民族有着很丰富的歌舞艺术文化，它是我们伟大祖国的文化艺术的重要组成部分。应该积极鼓励汉族干部进行兄弟民族舞蹈的整理改编工作。一方面协助兄弟民族发展其本民族舞蹈，一方面通过舞蹈艺术的形式，将少数民族的生活介绍给广大群众，起到各民族之间文化交流的作用。这些年来在这一方面已经获得不小的成就，而且受到了兄弟民族的热烈欢迎。但由于某些艺术工作者创作态度的轻率，在某些经过整理或改编了的兄弟民族舞蹈作品中出现了不符合生活真实，破坏民族风格特点的现象，这种轻率的态度应予改变。不能把兄弟民族的舞蹈形式与其本民族的生活、风俗习惯孤立起来理解，不能把兄弟民族的舞蹈语汇不加分析而当作单纯的素材来加工处理。我们首先要热爱兄弟民族的生活，要熟悉兄弟民族的历史生活思想感情和风俗习惯。必须在忠实于兄弟民族舞蹈的传统，保持原有的风格特点的基础上进行加工。在加工过程中要取得本民族的人民和民间艺人或专业艺术工作者亲密的合作，要尊重他们的意见，要依靠他们的帮助来完成。加工了的兄弟民族舞蹈的好坏标准，应以兄弟民族（本民族）的喜好为依据，坚决防止以作者自己的爱好代替兄弟民族的审美观的做法。加工了的兄弟民族舞蹈应该争取在其本民族地区经受考验。繁荣与发展兄弟民族音乐舞蹈事业的关键，在于培养出兄弟民族自己的艺术干部。应该大力帮助兄弟民族干部自己来进行整理加工和发展其本民族音乐舞蹈的工作，应该互相虚心学习。
    刘芝明说：从这次演出的节目看来，虽然反映现实生活的作品占了很大的数量，但内容题材还不够广泛，作品的思想性也应该进一步的加强。他说：随着题材的多样化，也必然要求形式多样化。应该进一步发展各种不同的形式如舞剧、歌舞、组舞等等，也应该作各种各样新的尝试。他认为，在要求作品的思想性的时候，应该考虑到舞蹈艺术的特点特长，和它的局限性。不能把它与文学或戏剧艺术等同起来要求。但舞蹈艺术工作者还是应该进一步的更加充分发挥和利用舞蹈艺术的特点来达到鼓舞和教育人民前进的目的。
    刘芝明指出：这次会演中有些节目由于作者过多地注意了形式，而忽略了考虑舞蹈作品的所应该具有的鼓舞和教育人民的作用，因而造成了主题不明确、爱憎不分明、内容不结实等现象。为了更好地表达内容，在形式上多下功夫是非常必要的，但形式毕竟是表现内容的手段，应该更多的注意如何通过形式来确切而完满的表达主题内容。另外，有些作品因为作者和演员深入生活、深入民间还不够，只看到一些表面现象，没有抓住生活里面最本质的东西，没有对传统的形式进行多方面和深入的分析、研究，便根据自己的想像加以发挥，结果在形式和内容 （包括人物）的处理上便出现了一般化的现象，缺乏感人的力量。他说：要克服一般化的缺点，关键是在深入生活，深入群众。作者和演员的本身还必须对生活具有敏锐的洞察力的正确的分析方法，其次还应该发挥自己的独特的创造。
    刘芝明在讲话最后要求各专业团体深入民间、深入生活，认真学习传统表演技巧；加强和当地群众的联系，重视辅导群众业余艺术活动，从群众中吸取营养，逐步形成自己的风格特点。他并要求贯彻勤俭办团的方针，提倡少花钱而效果好的办法。
