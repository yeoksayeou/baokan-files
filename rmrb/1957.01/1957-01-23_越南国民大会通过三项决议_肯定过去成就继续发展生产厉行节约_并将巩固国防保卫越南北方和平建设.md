Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 21st: The Vietnamese National Assembly passed a "Resolution on Economic Recovery Work" on the afternoon of the 20th.

The resolution first affirms that the Vietnamese government and people, in a difficult environment and in less than two years, have achieved many successes in the main tasks of economic recovery work. For example, grain production has exceeded pre-war levels, and the prices of major commodities have been stabilized. The production of industry and handicrafts has been restored and developed; the transportation sector has been restored; and most unemployment problems have been solved. The resolution believes that these achievements are fundamental and are the result of the efforts of the Vietnamese people and the assistance of fraternal countries.

The resolution also mentions shortcomings in economic recovery work, such as insufficient attention to light industry producing consumer goods and waste in certain economic management tasks.

The resolution approves the task proposed by the Vietnamese government to basically complete economic recovery work in 1957.

The resolution approves the guidelines proposed by the Vietnamese government, such as "taking production work as the center of all tasks; promoting the spirit of self-reliance; practicing thrift and opposing corruption and waste."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 22nd: The Vietnamese National Assembly passed a resolution on budgetary issues last night.

The resolution agrees with the Vietnamese government's financial guidelines and tasks for 1957. The resolution believes that it is necessary to continue to ensure the balance of budget revenue and expenditure; to ensure appropriate accumulation to expand construction; to complete the work of economic recovery and development; to develop culture; to consolidate national defense; and to gradually improve the people's living standards. The resolution points out that it is necessary to practice thrift, especially to pay attention to systematically reorganizing staffing to reduce the number of people separated from production, to improve the financial management of various economic departments, and to carry out the anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign.

The resolution affirms the government's financial policy formulated in 1956, and the resolution also mentions some shortcomings in last year's financial work.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 22nd: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnamese National Assembly unanimously passed the policies of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the task of consolidating national defense at its plenary session this morning.

The resolution stated: The National Assembly believes that Vietnam has restored peace, but peace is not yet consolidated; Vietnam is still temporarily divided into two parts. Imperialists and their followers are engaging in conspiracies, attempting to rekindle the flames of war, and undermine the unity of Vietnam; undermining peace in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world.

The resolution pointed out that North Vietnam has reduced its armed forces and 80,000 people have been demobilized, which is a concrete manifestation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's pursuit of a peaceful policy.

The resolution also emphasized that the Vietnamese army and people must consolidate national defense.

The resolution expressed the National Assembly's confidence that the Vietnamese People's Army will be able to help defend the peaceful construction of North Vietnam.
