Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th: Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and members of the People's Republic of China government delegation met with Soviet Olympic athletes on the evening of January 9th at the New Year fir tree party in the Kremlin Hall.

Since New Year's Day, the Kremlin's hall has been filled with songs every night as young people gather for parties. This evening, Soviet athletes who had triumphed at the Olympic Games in Melbourne not long ago, along with some foreign athletes passing through the Soviet Union, came to attend the dance. Some of them wore gold medals on their chests, symbols of their victories in the games.

The lights of the magnificent New Year fir tree were lit. In the Hall of Facets, the St. George Hall, and the Vladimir Hall, there was singing and laughter everywhere. Amateur artists and actors were performing.

As the party was in full swing, Bulganin, Mikoyan, Khrushchev, Zhou Enlai, He Long, and others arrived at the St. George Hall, having come from the Bolshoi Theatre after watching "Swan Lake." The Olympic athletes welcomed them with stormy applause and cheers.

Khrushchev first congratulated the Soviet athletes. On behalf of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government, he congratulated the Soviet athletes on their victories in international sports competitions. Khrushchev said: You have demonstrated your talents and skills very well, and you have protected the sporting honor of our country. Now, the most important thing is not to be arrogant. There will be even more important sports competitions in the future. We should consolidate and develop intellectual and physical strength, and we should improve the skills of various sports. The Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government are very satisfied and happy with your achievements.

Khrushchev concluded by congratulating the sincere and unbreakable friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China. He exclaimed: "Long live our guests, the envoys of great China!" At this moment, a chorus of cheers resounded in the hall.

Zhou Enlai then congratulated the Soviet athletes on their great victories in the Olympic Games. He said that your Chinese brothers are still lagging behind in sports and athletics. However, in another ten years, Chinese athletes will also achieve significant results. Chinese and Soviet athletes should advance together, and Chinese athletes should learn from Soviet athletes.

Zhou Enlai wished the Chinese and Soviet people to advance side by side in all aspects of their work, congratulated the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and congratulated the great Soviet people and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. At this moment, stormy applause erupted in the hall and continued for several minutes.

Next, Olympic champion and Honored Master of Sports of the USSR, Kuts, thanked the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union on behalf of the Soviet athletes for their care for the development of Soviet sports. He also welcomed the government delegation of the People's Republic of China headed by Premier Zhou Enlai on behalf of the Soviet athletes. At this moment, the hall echoed with cheers of "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!"
