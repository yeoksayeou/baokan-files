Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 10th: At the insistence of the US delegation, the United Nations General Assembly re-discussed the so-called "Hungarian question" on the 9th. In order to stir up new clamor about the Hungarian situation, which has already returned to normal order, and to divert the attention of the United Nations General Assembly from some important issues under discussion, the United States, with the support of twenty-three countries including Britain, France, Spain, the Philippines, El Salvador, and Chile, put forward a new proposal. This proposal, on the one hand, reiterated previous resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly, slandering the Hungarian People's Republic and the Soviet Union's actions in suppressing the Hungarian counter-revolutionary conspiracy. On the other hand, it put forward a new proposal attempting to interfere in Hungarian affairs, namely, to establish a special committee composed of five countries to "investigate" the so-called Hungarian question, to "establish and maintain direct observation in Hungary and elsewhere, and to hear testimony, gather evidence, and collect intelligence."

US Representative Lodge, in his speech, demanded the adoption of this proposal. He continued to slander the Hungarian People's Republic, the Soviet Union, and the entire socialist camp. He tried every possible means to make the United Nations participate in the "denunciation" of the socialist camp countries planned by the United States, and he also demanded that the United Nations "not relax its attention to the Hungarian situation."

The Cuban representative repeated past claims, demanding that the General Assembly take "sanctions" against the Hungarian government, but he admitted that this view received little support in the United Nations.

Ceylon's representative, Gunawardene, expressed support for the twenty-four-nation proposal, saying that he thought the origins and course of the Hungarian events should be clarified. The Nepalese representative also supported the twenty-four-nation proposal.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Kuznetsov, made a detailed speech, exposing the reasons and purposes of the new uproar created by the United States and some other countries on the Hungarian question.

Kuznetsov first talked in detail about the subversive activities carried out by the United States against Hungary and other socialist camp countries, and drew the attention of the General Assembly to the fact that some Americans are still attempting to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs and incite counter-revolutionaries against the government of the Hungarian People's Republic.

Kuznetsov refuted the claim that the Soviet Union undermined Hungarian sovereignty, and pointed out that it was none other than the United States that infringed upon the rights of other countries. The new doctrine put forward by the United States regarding its policy in the Near and Middle East is clear evidence of this.

Kuznetsov said that after Nixon's visit to Austria, various absurd rumors about the Hungarian situation became more and more numerous. It seems that some Americans are very unwilling to watch the adventure of the Hungarian counter-revolutionary coup, which was carried out with the money of American taxpayers, fall into complete bankruptcy. He said that peace-loving people cannot and should not forget that reactionary forces are still continuing their criminal activities, attempting to hinder the victorious advance of socialism.

Kuznetsov pointed out that with the unity and vigilance of peace and progressive forces, the enemies of international peace and freedom cannot succeed. The Hungarian people have convincingly confirmed that any attempt by the instigators of the riots, any arrogance of world reactionaries and its agents cannot stop the Hungarian people from consolidating their people's democratic state and creating conditions for the further prosperity of the country's economy and culture. Therefore, the reactionary groups are trying their best to provoke new chaos so that the provocative activities against Hungary will not be suppressed.

Talking about the US proposal, Kuznetsov said that currently in the United Nations, some people are planning new proposals, suggesting the establishment of a committee to summon political prisoners, criminals, and other people who have escaped from Hungary and participated in anti-Hungarian activities, wanting to use these traitors, political prisoners, and criminals to oppose the Soviet Union and Hungary. This new attempt to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs is contrary to the spirit and provisions of the United Nations Charter. It can only show how despicable the methods adopted by those who instigated the Hungarian rebellion are after they have been taught a lesson by the Hungarian people and their conspiracies have failed. Any actions and measures of this committee have no legal basis whatsoever. Such measures are clearly illegal.

The Soviet representative pointed out that if the proposal put forward at the initiative of the United States is adopted, it will damage the prestige of the United Nations and prompt some people to use this organization to carry out slanderous propaganda campaigns against Hungary and other socialist countries and to sharpen the international situation in accordance with the interests of the reactionary groups of certain countries. The United Nations' responsibility is to stop this new attempt to launch a cold war and to reject this proposal. It is time to stop sabotage against the Hungarian people.

Representatives of Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Poland also expressed their opposition to the twenty-four-nation proposal in their speeches.

    联大重新讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”
    苏联代表抨击美国煽动冷战的新提案
    据新华社10日讯　纽约消息：由于美国代表团的坚持，联合国大会9日又重新讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”。为了就已经恢复正常秩序的匈牙利局势掀起新的叫嚷，并且转移联合国大会对正在讨论的一些重要问题的注意，美国在英国、法国、西班牙、菲律宾、萨尔瓦多、智利等二十三个国家的支持下提出了一个新的提案，这个提案一方面重申联合国大会以前的决议，诽谤匈牙利人民共和国和苏联镇压匈牙利反革命阴谋的行动，另一方面又提出一个企图干涉匈牙利事务的新主张，就是设立一个由五个国家组成的特别委员会，就所谓匈牙利问题“进行调查”，在匈牙利和其他地方“建立和保持直接的观察，并且听取证辞、搜集证据和收集情报”。
    美国代表洛奇在发言中要求通过这个提案。他继续对匈牙利人民共和国、苏联和整个社会主义阵营进行诬蔑，他千方百计地企图要联合国参加美国所策划的对社会主义阵营国家的“声讨”，他并且要求联合国“不要放松对匈牙利局势的注意”。
    古巴代表重复过去的主张，要求大会对匈牙利政府采取“制裁行动”，但是他承认，这个意见在联合国中只得到很少的支持。
    锡兰代表古纳瓦地尼表示支持二十四国提案，他说他认为应该搞清楚匈牙利事件的起源和经过。尼泊尔代表也支持二十四国提案。
    苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫作了详尽的发言，揭露了以美国为首的一些国家在匈牙利问题上制造新的喧嚷的原因和目的。
    库兹涅佐夫首先详细地谈到了美国对匈牙利和其他社会主义阵营国家所进行的颠复活动，并且提请大会注意，某些美国人士目前仍然企图干涉匈牙利的内政，煽动反革命分子反对匈牙利人民共和国政府。
    库兹涅佐夫驳斥了所谓苏联破坏匈牙利主权的说法，并且指出，侵犯其他国家权利的不是别人，而正是美国自己。美国提出的关于中近东政策的新主义就是明证。
    库兹涅佐夫说，在尼克松访问奥地利以后，关于匈牙利情况的各种荒谬无稽的谣言是愈来愈多了，看来某些美国人士很不甘心眼巴巴地看着用美国纳税人的钱搞起来的匈牙利反革命政变的冒险陷于彻底破产。他说，爱好和平的人民不可能而且也不应该忘记，反动势力还在继续罪恶活动，企图阻碍社会主义的胜利前进。
    库兹涅佐夫指出，在和平和进步力量团结一致和提高警惕的情况下，国际和平和自由的敌人是不可能得逞的。匈牙利人民已经令人信服地证实，暴乱策动者的任何企图、世界反动派和它的代理人的任何狂妄都不能阻挡匈牙利人民巩固自己的人民民主国家和为本国经济文化的进一步繁荣创造条件。因此，反动集团就竭力想挑起新的混乱，不让反对匈牙利的挑衅活动被镇压下去。
    谈到美国的提案的时候，库兹涅佐夫说，目前在联合国中，有人策划新的提案，建议成立一个传讯从匈牙利逃出来的政治犯、刑事犯以及其他参加过反匈牙利活动的分子的委员会，想使联合国利用那些叛徒、政治犯和刑事犯来反对苏联和匈牙利。这种干涉匈牙利内政的新的企图是同联合国宪章的精神和条文相抵触的。它只能表明，那些策动匈牙利叛乱的人在受到匈牙利人民一顿教训和自己的阴谋诡计失败以后，竟采取了多么卑鄙的手法。这一委员会的任何行为和措施都是毫无法律根据的。这种措施显然是不合法的。
    苏联代表指出，如果通过了根据美国倡议所提出的提案，就会损害联合国的威信，并且促使有些人根据某些国家反动集团的利益利用这个组织来进行诬蔑匈牙利和其他社会主义国家的宣传运动以及使国际局势尖锐化。联合国的职责是阻止这种发动冷战的新企图，并且否决这个提案。现在是停止对匈牙利人民进行破坏工作的时候了。
    罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克和波兰等国家的代表在发言中也表示反对二十四国提案。
