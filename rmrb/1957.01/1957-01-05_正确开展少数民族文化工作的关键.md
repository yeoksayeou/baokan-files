The cultural work of ethnic minorities has made considerable progress and achievements in the past few years. The culture and arts of various ethnic minorities have been protected and promoted. Many poems, music, dances, fine arts, historical relics, etc., that were once buried, have been continuously excavated and sorted out. New literary and artistic creations are also flourishing. Mass cultural and artistic activities of ethnic minorities are also more active than before. Various cultural undertakings carried out by the state in ethnic minority areas have developed to varying degrees, among which the development of film projection units, publishing and distribution institutions, cultural centers, cultural stations, and cultural service teams is relatively large. All these cultural works have played a significant role in cooperating with the national and ethnic groups' political and economic construction tasks, conducting socialist and patriotic education for the people of all ethnic groups, promoting understanding and unity among all ethnic groups, enriching the cultural lives of the people of all ethnic groups, thereby promoting the great socialist construction cause of the motherland; and have accumulated some experience and cultivated a group of ethnic minority cadres in the work.

The cultural heritage of ethnic minorities, like the economic resources of ethnic minority areas, is extremely rich. The people of all ethnic groups possess enormous wisdom. All ethnic groups in our country not only jointly created our country's history and culture in the past, but will also demonstrate great and outstanding creative talents in the construction of the new socialist national culture in our country.

In recent years, with the rapid political and economic development of ethnic minorities, the people of all ethnic groups have an urgent need for cultural life. To meet their urgent needs and actively and steadily raise the culture of all ethnic groups to a modern level is our major and arduous task.

Such a task, of course, cannot be achieved in a short period of time. There is no reason to be complacent about the achievements we have already made. We must affirm our achievements, overcome our shortcomings, and further develop the cultural work of ethnic minorities on the existing basis, so as to achieve the great goal of raising the culture of all ethnic groups to a modern level within a certain period of time.

To further develop the cultural work of ethnic minorities, what is the key issue at present?

The key lies in resolutely and thoroughly overcoming Han chauvinism. Although the class basis of Han chauvinism has been gradually changed and eliminated since the founding of New China, the remnants of this ideological influence still exist and are often consciously or unconsciously reflected in our work. The problems that have existed in the cultural work of ethnic minorities in the past few years precisely illustrate the harm of this ideology.

Han chauvinism is first manifested in the lack of importance attached to the cultural work of ethnic minorities by cultural departments. The central authorities in charge of cultural affairs have long failed to place it in its due important position and conduct comprehensive planning in a timely manner. In regular work, they also lack the necessary understanding of the profound changes that have taken place in various aspects of ethnic minority areas and the complexity of cultural work of ethnic minorities, making the guidance generalized. As a result, several aspects of cultural undertakings, such as film and publishing, have fallen far short of meeting objective needs. There is a lack of effective measures to overcome the imbalance in cultural development among ethnic groups.

Han chauvinism is also manifested in the disregard for the cultural heritage of various ethnic minorities. Some Han literary and art workers believe that the culture and art of ethnic minorities are poor and backward. In their collection and sorting work, they adopted a rude attitude that ignored the cultural and artistic traditions of various ethnic groups, arbitrarily "processed" and "improved" them, discarded the original style and characteristics, and aroused dissatisfaction among ethnic minority people. For the traditional folk cultural and artistic activities of ethnic minority people, some Han cadres either regarded them as "promoting superstition" or "harming social morality," and carried out unreasonable interference and prohibition. As a result, the mass cultural and artistic activities of ethnic minorities cannot be fully developed, and their rich cultural heritage, especially oral literature, is in danger of being lost.

Han chauvinism is also manifested in the discrimination against cultural cadres of ethnic minorities. Some cultural administrative departments believe that ethnic minority cadres have low cultural levels and poor abilities, and are unwilling to recruit and use them; even if they are recruited and used, they dare not let go boldly and take care of everything themselves. Some Han cadres even use whether ethnic minority cadres are Sinicized as a standard for progress and backwardness, which is actually encouraging them to separate from the people of their own ethnic groups. As a result, ethnic minority cadres cannot grow up in large numbers and quickly, and the development of cultural work of ethnic minorities is greatly hindered.

The National Ethnic Minority Cultural Work Conference convened by the Ministry of Culture not long ago resolutely and sharply criticized this Han chauvinistic thought, and clearly pointed out that overcoming Han chauvinistic thought is the key to further developing the cultural work of ethnic minorities. This is completely correct. Our country is a multi-ethnic country. In the past, relying on the joint efforts of all ethnic groups, we created our country's history and culture. In the future, in the glorious task of creating a new socialist national culture in our country, we need to rely on the joint efforts of all ethnic groups to jointly improve. Facts have proved that the literary and artistic heritage of various ethnic minorities is very rich. What has been excavated so far is only a very small part of it. These beautiful poems, music, dances, and fine arts have not only been cherished and loved by the people of the whole country, but have also had a significant impact on international cultural exchanges. This shows that although the level of development of various ethnic minorities is different, it is by no means the case that all ethnic minorities are backward in all aspects. Some ethnic groups have a higher level of development in certain aspects than the Han people, and it is worth learning from them. Of course, due to the limitations of historically formed conditions, ethnic minorities still need the strong assistance of the Han people in cultural construction. It should be said that the current assistance is not too much, but too little. It is entirely necessary to continue to encourage Han cultural and artistic workers to serve ethnic minorities and dedicate themselves to the cultural construction of various fraternal ethnic groups. At the same time, we must recognize that the development of cultural work of ethnic minorities is mainly determined by the growth of cultural cadres of various ethnic minorities. Because ethnic minority cadres are most familiar with the situation of their own ethnic groups and have flesh-and-blood ties with the people of their own ethnic groups. The role they play cannot be replaced by Han cultural cadres. Therefore, in carrying out the cultural work of ethnic minorities, we must recruit a large number of cadres from all ethnic groups to participate in the work, and we must cultivate and help the growth of cadres of their own ethnic groups with the greatest enthusiasm, otherwise we cannot talk about truly carrying out the cultural work of ethnic minorities at all.

The policy for the next period determined by the National Ethnic Minority Cultural Work Conference is: to closely cooperate with the political and economic development of all ethnic groups, comprehensively plan, rationally deploy, strengthen leadership, and actively develop the cultural work of ethnic minorities according to the characteristics and actual conditions of all ethnic groups, so as to promote the construction and prosperity of the new socialist national culture in our country. This policy is in line with the actual situation and is correct. It is hoped that cultural administrative departments at all levels and all comrades engaged in the cultural work of ethnic minorities will, on the basis of their original achievements, conscientiously study the Party's ethnic policies and resolutely overcome Han chauvinistic ideas in their work, so that this policy can be effectively implemented.

### 正确开展少数民族文化工作的关键

    正确开展少数民族文化工作的关键
    几年来少数民族文化工作有相当大的发展和成绩。各少数民族的文化艺术，受到了保护和发扬，许多曾经被埋没的诗歌、音乐、舞蹈、美术、历史文物等，不断地被发掘、整理出来。新的文艺创作也在欣欣向荣。少数民族的群众文化艺术活动也较前活跃。国家举办的在少数民族地区的各项文化事业，有了不同程度的发展，其中以电影放映单位、出版发行机构、文化馆、文化站、文化服务队等的发展较大。所有这些文化工作，在配合国家和各民族的政治、经济建设任务，对各族人民进行社会主义和爱国主义的教育，促进各民族之间的了解和团结，丰富各族人民的文化生活，从而推动祖国伟大的社会主义建设事业方面，起了显著的作用；并且在工作中积累了一些经验，培养了一批民族干部。
    少数民族的文化遗产同少数民族地区的经济资源一样，是极为丰富的。各族人民蕴藏着巨大的智慧。我国各民族不仅在过去共同创造了我国的历史和文化，而且必将在我国社会主义民族的新文化建设中，显示巨大和卓越的创造才能。
    几年来随着少数民族政治、经济的迅速发展，各民族人民对于文化生活的要求是迫切的。满足他们的迫切要求，积极地和稳步地把各民族的文化提高到现代的水平，是我们的重大和艰巨的任务。
    这样的任务，当然不是短时期内所能实现的。我们现在已经取得的成绩，没有理由可以自满。必须在现有基础上，肯定成绩，克服缺点，进一步开展少数民族文化工作，以便在一定时期内，达到把各民族的文化提高到现代的水平的伟大目标。
    要进一步开展少数民族的文化工作，当前的关键问题在那里呢？
    关键在于坚决地彻底地克服大汉族主义思想。尽管新中国成立以后，大民族主义的阶级基础正在逐渐改变和消灭，但是这种思想影响的残余仍然存在，常常自觉地或者不自觉地反映到我们的工作中来。几年来少数民族文化工作中存在的问题，正说明这种思想的危害性。
    大汉族主义思想首先表现在文化部门对少数民族文化工作的重视不足。中央主管文化部门长期没有把它放到应有的重要地位，及时地进行全面规划。而在经常工作中，又对少数民族地区各方面所发生的深刻变化，对少数民族文化工作的复杂性，缺乏必要的认识，使指导流于一般化。其结果是，文化事业的若干方面如电影、出版事业已经远远不能适应客观的需要。对各民族间文化发展的不平衡状态，缺乏有效的办法加以克服。
    大汉族主义思想还表现为对各少数民族文化遗产的轻视。有一些汉族的文艺工作者，认为少数民族的文化艺术是贫乏的、落后的。他们在搜集、整理工作中，采取了无视各民族文化艺术传统的粗暴态度，随便地“加工”“提高”，丢掉原有的风格和特色，引起少数民族人民的不满。对于少数民族人民群众的民间的传统文化艺术活动，有一些汉族干部不是认为“提倡迷信”，就是认为“有伤风化”，进行无理的干涉和禁止。其结果，就使少数民族的群众文化艺术活动不能充分发展，他们的丰富的文化遗产，特别是口头文学，有失传的危险。
    大汉族主义思想还表现为对少数民族的文化干部的歧视。有一些文化行政部门，认为少数民族干部文化低、能力差，不愿吸收、使用；即使吸收使用，也不敢大胆放手，一切包办代替。有的汉族干部甚至以少数民族干部是否汉化，作为进步和落后的标准，实际上是鼓励他们脱离本民族的人民群众。其结果是，少数民族干部不能大量地迅速地成长，少数民族文化工作的开展受到很大的阻碍。
    文化部不久前召开的全国少数民族文化工作会议，坚决地和尖锐地批判了这种大汉族主义思想，并且明确指出，克服大汉族主义思想是进一步开展少数民族文化工作的关键。这是完全正确的。我国是多民族的国家，过去依靠各民族的共同努力，创造了我国的历史和文化。今后在创造我国社会主义的民族的新文化的光荣任务中，更需要依靠各民族的共同努力，共同提高。事实证明，各少数民族的文学、艺术的遗产是非常丰富的。到现在为止已经发掘出来的，仅仅是其中极少的一部分。这些优美的诗歌、音乐、舞蹈、美术，不仅已经为全国人民所珍视和喜爱，并且在国际文化交流中，发生了重大的影响。这就说明，各少数民族的发展水平虽然不一样，但是绝对不是所有的少数民族在一切方面都落后。有一些民族在某些方面的发展比汉族还高，值得汉族人民向他们学习。当然，由于历史形成的条件限制，少数民族在文化建设方面，还需要汉族人民的大力援助。应当说，目前这种援助不是太多，而是太少，完全有必要继续鼓励汉族的文化艺术工作者为少数民族服务，献身于各兄弟民族的文化建设事业。同时，我们必须认识，少数民族文化工作的发展，主要还是决定于各少数民族文化干部的成长。因为民族干部最熟悉本民族的情况，同本民族的人民群众有着血肉的联系。他们所起的作用，决不是汉族文化干部所能代替的。因此，在开展少数民族的文化工作中，必须大量地吸收各民族干部参加工作，必须以最大的热忱培养和帮助本民族干部的成长，否则就根本谈不到真正开展少数民族的文化工作。
    全国少数民族文化工作会议所确定的今后一个时期的方针是：密切配合各民族政治、经济的发展，根据各民族的特点和实际情况，全面规划，合理部署，加强领导，积极发展少数民族的文化工作，以促进我国社会主义的民族的新文化的建设和繁荣。这个方针是符合实际情况的，是正确的。希望各级文化行政部门和一切从事于少数民族文化工作的同志，在原有成绩的基础上，认真学习党的民族政策，坚决克服工作中存在的大汉族主义思想，使这一方针得到有效的贯彻。
