    Anti-Freeze Ink
    The Tianjin Ink Factory, a joint state-private enterprise producing "Ostrich" ink, has recently successfully trial-produced a type of anti-freeze concentrated ink, which will be put into production in the first quarter of this year.

    This ink was trial-produced to meet the needs of personnel engaged in geological and hydrological exploration, and forest logging in northern China. It will not freeze at temperatures as low as minus ten degrees Celsius. Each bottle has a capacity of only one-tenth of ordinary ink, making it very convenient to transport and carry. When in use, it can be diluted with an appropriate proportion of water, and its quality is the same as ordinary ink.

    防寒墨水
    生产“鸵鸟”墨水的公私合营天津市墨水厂，最近试制成功一种防寒浓缩墨水，将在今年第一季内投入生产。
    这种墨水是为在北方进行地质、水利勘探和森林采伐等工作人员的需要而试制的。它在摄氏零下十度以内不会结冰，每瓶容量仅为普通墨水的十分之一，运输和携带很方便。用的时候，用适当比例的水把它冲稀，质量和普通墨水一样。
