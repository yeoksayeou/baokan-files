Xinhua News Agency, 22nd — This year's forestry scientific research tasks will focus on thirty projects based on the eight central issues in the national twelve-year science and technology development plan that fall under the forestry domain. This was determined at the 1957 Forestry Scientific Research Work Plan Conference convened by the Ministry of Forestry. These projects are closely related to current forestry construction tasks—expanding forest resources and rational forest management—and will lay the foundation for the development of forestry science.

To address the shortage of forest resources in China and ensure the growing demand for forest products, especially timber, in national construction, the conference deemed it particularly important to vigorously cultivate timber forests in areas south of the Yangtze River with favorable climatic conditions. Chinese fir is the most important timber tree species in the south. This year's research projects will include studies on the relationship between the growth of important tree species such as Chinese fir, pine, camphor, eucalyptus, *Castanopsis*, and *Phoebe zhennan*, and environmental conditions, as well as studies on afforestation techniques for these tree species. Bamboo forest management has a long history and experience in China, and the utilization of bamboo has great significance in the national economy. The research projects have determined to conduct surveys and studies on the environmental conditions for *Phyllostachys edulis* growth in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and systematically summarize mass experiences to improve bamboo forest management techniques.

The conference considered that it is particularly important to create various types of forests with protective significance in the arid regions of northern China. Technical research on soil and water conservation forests in the Yellow River basin, shelterbelts and sand-fixation forests in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and Northwest China, and afforestation on barren hills in North China have all been included in this year's research projects. Seeds and seedlings are the material basis for greening. This year, emphasis will be placed on studying the fruiting patterns of important tree species, forecasting seed yields, and conducting research on dryland seedling cultivation techniques in loess areas. Tree breeding is one of the most effective measures to improve forest productivity. This year, research on the breeding of important tree species such as Chinese fir, pine, poplar, and walnut will begin.

The conference also decided to conduct research on major forest diseases, pests, and forest fire prevention technologies, studying the patterns of forest fire occurrence and prevention technologies. Regarding forest diseases and pests, in addition to studying known important diseases and pests and exploring effective and economical control methods, systematic surveys and studies will be conducted on the types and distribution of forest pests in important forest areas.

The conference decided to compile a "Dendrology" as a basic reference for various forestry studies. The compilation work will start with regional dendrologies, gradually completing the work of a national "Dendrology." The conference also determined research topics in areas such as the study of forest types, forest logging methods, forest tending, and forest management organizational principles.

The conference also clarified the responsible units and persons for each research topic, mainly involving four forces: the Chinese Academy of Sciences, higher agricultural and forestry schools, the Forestry Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Forestry, and local experimental research institutions. The conference believes that this is a good start to comprehensively and systematically conducting collaboration on the forestry scientific research front.

    结合当前林业建设任务发展林业科学
    林业部确定今年林业科学研究任务
    新华社22日讯　今年的林业科学研究任务，将以国家十二年科学技术远景规划中属于林业方面的八个中心问题为基础的三十个项目为主。这是在林业部召开的1957年林业科学研究工作计划会议上确定的。这些项目和当前林业建设任务——扩大森林资源和森林合理经营密切相关，同时将为林业科学的发展打下基础。
    为了解决我国森林资源不足，保证国家建设中对林产品尤其是木材不断增长的要求，会议认为在气候条件优越的长江以南各地大力培植用材林具有特别重要的意义。杉木是南方最主要的用材树种。今年的研究项目中将要包括对杉、松、樟、桉、桢、楠等重要树种的生长与环境条件关系的研究，以及这些树种的造林技术的研究。竹林的经营在我国有长期的历史和经验，竹材的利用在国民经济中具有极大意义，研究项目中确定要在江苏和浙江地区进行毛竹生长环境条件的调查研究，系统地总结群众经验，以提高竹林的经营技术。
    会议认为，在我国北方干旱地区营造各种具有防护意义的森林特别重要。黄河流域的水土保持林，东北、内蒙古和西北等地的防护林和固沙林以及华北地区的荒山造林等方面的技术研究都列入了今年的研究项目。种子和苗木是绿化的物质基础，今年将着重研究各重要树种的结实规律，种子产量的预报，和进行黄土区旱地育苗技术的研究。树木的育种是提高森林生产率最有效措施之一，今年将开始对杉、松、杨、胡桃等重要树种的育种进行研究。
    会议还确定要对主要森林病、虫害和森林防火技术进行研究。研究林火发生的规律和预防的技术措施。对于森林病、虫害，除了对已知的重要病、虫害进行研究，探求有效而经济的防治方法外，还要系统地调查研究重要林区森林害虫的种类和分布。
    会议确定编写“树木志”作为林业各项研究的基本参考。编写工作是从区域性的树木志着手，逐渐完成全国“树木志”的工作。会议还确定了在林型的研究、森林主伐方式、森林抚育、森林经营组织原则等方面的研究题目。
    这次会议还明确了各个研究题目的负责单位和负责人，主要是中国科学院、高等农林学校、林业部林业科学研究所和地方试验研究机构四个方面的力量。会议认为，这是林业科学研究战线上全面地有计划地进行协作的一个良好的开端。
