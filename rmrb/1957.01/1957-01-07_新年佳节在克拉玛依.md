    The employees of the Karamay Oilfield celebrated the New Year with such a joyous and lively atmosphere that it almost made one forget that this was in the Gobi Desert.

    The last workday of 1956 had just ended, and the oil city was already bustling with excitement. In the spacious ethnic dining hall, some people were still eating, while on the other side, people had moved the tables aside and started dancing. The club, which had just been completed and handed over that afternoon, was already showing movies in the evening.

    Since the beginning of winter, Karamay had been experiencing either snowfall or fog. However, both New Year's Eve and New Year's Day were exceptionally clear. Employees who enjoyed sports became active, clearing the snow from the ball courts and holding basketball friendly matches one after another. Despite the cold weather, the ball courts were surrounded by spectators for every game. A group of young workers from the mechanical repair shop even went all the way to Black Oil Mountain to play a football match.

    On New Year's Eve, the Mining Bureau held a large-scale gala. The gala featured various group games, and the employees performed self-rehearsed choruses, ethnic dances, and magic tricks. One of the bureau directors, joining in the fun, even sang a tune from his hometown opera – Shanxi Bangzi. There were also two weddings at the gala, adding to the immense joy.

    The most active during the New Year's activities were the young students who had just joined the oilfield construction, some of whom were spending the New Year away from their parents for the first time. They wrote many articles on the New Year's wall newspapers and sent many New Year's cards to their relatives and classmates far away. He Yumei, a nineteen-year-old nurse at the mine's clinic, wrote in a letter to her mother in Lishui, Zhejiang: "I have grown another year since leaving Mom. A year ago, I was still a child, but now I can contribute to the construction of the motherland. When I see the patients I care for recover their health and return to the oilfield to work, I feel indescribable happiness and joy."

    Many employees in the mining area have settled down and started families here. These newly established families also had a satisfying New Year. The trade company specially transported sixty tons of New Year's goods to the mining area before the holiday, including meat, frozen fish, frozen eggs, vermicelli, vegetables, seasonings, pastries, and dried and fresh fruits, and set up temporary outlets to supply the employees' families.

    Although it was the New Year, production did not stop for a minute. On the Gobi Desert, the workers on duty and their drilling rigs continued to work as usual. At exactly twelve o'clock on New Year's Eve, it was time for the shift change. The incoming drillers exchanged "Happy New Year" greetings with the outgoing drillers, took over the handles, and the exploration mission for the new year began. The drilling rig continued to rotate smoothly and steadily without interruption.

    新年佳节在克拉玛依
    新华社记者  伊晓
    克拉玛依油田的职工欢度新年，那种欢乐热闹的气氛几乎使人忘记了这是在戈壁滩上。
    1956年的最后一个工作日刚刚结束，石油城就欢腾起来了。在宽阔的民族食堂里，这半间屋子还有人在吃饭，而那半边，人们已挪开了饭桌跳起舞来。当天下午才落成交工的俱乐部，晚间就放映起电影。
    克拉玛依入冬以来，不是飘雪就是下雾。可是除夕和元旦这两天格外晴朗。爱好体育的职工们活跃起来了，他们铲除了球场上的积雪，一场又一场地展开了篮球友谊赛。虽然天气很冷，每一场球赛，球场周围还是围满了观战的人。机械修理厂的一群年轻工人，还特别跑到很远的黑油山去踢了一场足球。
    除夕，矿务局举行了大型联欢晚会。晚会上进行了各种集体游戏，职工们演出了自己排演的合唱、民族舞和魔术。和大家一起玩乐的一位局长也唱了一曲他的家乡戏——山西梆子。晚会上还有两对新人结婚，更增添了无限喜气。
    新年活动中最活跃的是那些刚参加油田建设的青年学生们，他们中间有的还是第一次离开爸爸妈妈过新年。他们在新年墙报上写了许多文章，并且给他们远方的亲人和同学寄了许多贺年信。矿区医务所护士、十九岁的何玉美，在给她远在浙江丽水的妈妈的信中写道：“我离开妈妈又长大一岁了，一年前我还是个孩子，可是我现在已经能在祖国建设中尽一份力量了，当我看着我护理的病人恢复了健康又去建设油田的时候，我感到说不出的幸福和快乐。”
    矿区里有许多职工在这里建家立业了。这些新建的小家庭，新年也都过得称心。贸易公司特为矿区在年前运来六十吨年货，有肉类、冻鱼、冰蛋、粉条、菜蔬、调料、糕点和干鲜果品，并且设立了临时门市部给职工家属供应。
    虽然在过年，生产却一分钟也没有停顿，在戈壁滩上，值班工人和他们的钻机，照常地工作着。除夕十二点正，正是接班的时间。换班的钻井员们同上一班的钻井员互道一声“新年好”，接过闸把，新的一年的勘探任务就这样开始了，钻机毫不间歇地继续匀称地转动下去。
