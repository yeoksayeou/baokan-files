Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 17th: The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic convened a meeting in Berlin on the 16th. The Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, delivered a statement on behalf of the government, discussing the results of the talks between the government delegations of the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union in Moscow, and some issues in the current international situation.

Grotewohl pointed out: The Moscow talks and their achievements are a new milestone on the road of fraternal cooperation. During the talks, the two countries held completely identical views on all pressing international issues, including the German question.

When talking about the international situation, Grotewohl praised the Soviet Union's peace policy for constantly crushing the conspiracies of war provocateurs. He also condemned the "Eisenhower Doctrine," exposing the aggressive nature of American imperialism's policy towards Arab countries.

Grotewohl declared that the German Democratic Republic supports the people of the Near East and Middle East, and fully supports the Yemeni government in its struggle against aggressors and for the Yemeni people.

Speaking about the situation in Hungary, Grotewohl said that the German Democratic Republic will do everything possible to help the Hungarian people overcome their difficulties. Grotewohl emphasized that the Hungarian events educated the people of the German Democratic Republic, and we must use all our strength to oppose any attempt by our enemies to disrupt peaceful construction.

Grotewohl congratulated Poland on its development on the road to further building socialism, and reiterated that the German Democratic Republic recognizes the inviolability of the Oder-Neisse border.

Grotewohl then pointed out that the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union in Moscow had reiterated their willingness to hold talks to discuss issues such as disarmament, banning the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, establishing arms limitation zones, and undertaking other activities sufficient to ease international tensions. However, the reactionary forces in West Germany and the entire capitalist world should not think that the German Democratic Republic will only respond to constant threats and provocations with disarmament proposals. It will strengthen its national defense, remain vigilant, and act in accordance with the Warsaw Treaty to defend the western outpost of the socialist camp.

Grotewohl concluded by saying that our talks with the government of the Soviet Union and the delegation of the People's Republic of China in Moscow have shown the world that the German Democratic Republic is supported by the two largest countries in the world, and we know that we can rely on such friends in any situation.

After discussion, the People's Chamber unanimously passed a resolution endorsing the government's statement and instructing the government to implement the various measures in its statement. (Attached photo)

    格罗提渥在人民议院发表政府声明
    保卫社会主义阵营西部前哨　粉碎战争挑拨者阴谋
    人民议院一致通过决议赞同政府声明
    新华社柏林17日电　德意志民主共和国人民议院会议16日在柏林开幕。德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥在会上代表政府发表了声明，谈到德苏两国政府代表团在莫斯科的会谈结果和目前国际局势中的一些问题。
    格罗提渥指出：莫斯科会谈和它的成就是兄弟合作道路上的一个新的里程碑。会谈中，两国在一切迫切的国际问题（其中也包括德国问题）上，观点完全一致。
    在谈到国际局势的时候，格罗提渥赞扬苏联和平政策不断粉碎战争挑拨者的阴谋。他还谴责“艾森豪威尔主义”，揭露了美帝国主义对阿拉伯国家的政策的侵略性质。
    格罗提渥声明，德意志民主共和国支持近东和中东各国人民，它完全支持也门政府为反抗侵略者和为也门人民进行的斗争。
    在谈到匈牙利形势的时候，格罗提渥说，德意志民主共和国将尽一切可能帮助匈牙利人民克服他们的困难。格罗提渥强调指出，匈牙利事件教育了德意志民主共和国人民，我们必须用一切力量反对我们的敌人扰乱和平建设的任何企图。
    格罗提渥祝贺波兰在进一步建设社会主义的道路上的发展，并且重申民主德国承认奥得—尼斯河边界的不可侵犯性。
    格罗提渥接着指出，德意志民主共和国政府和苏联政府在莫斯科曾经重申愿意进行会谈来讨论裁减军备、禁止试验原子武器和氢武器建立限制军备地带及进行足以缓和国际紧张局势的其他活动等问题。但是西德和整个资本主义世界的反动势力不应该认为德意志民主共和国将只用裁军建议来回答不断的威胁和挑衅。它将加强国防、保持警惕，并且按照华沙条约行事，以保卫社会主义阵营的西部前哨。
    格罗提渥最后说，我们同苏联政府和中华人民共和国政府代表团在莫斯科的会谈向全世界表明，德意志民主共和国受到世界上两个最大的国家的支持，而且我们知道，在任何情况下都可以信赖这样的朋友。
    人民议院在讨论后一致通过决议，赞成政府的声明，并且责成政府实行它的声明中的各项措施。（附图片）
