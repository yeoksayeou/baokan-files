In the recently launched campaign to increase production and practice economy, a new atmosphere of responsible cadres taking the lead in advocating a hard-working and simple lifestyle has emerged within the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Below are some specific examples collected during the reporter's interviews:

　　Minister Carries Pork

　　The abundant and timely supply of pork in Chongqing markets during the recent New Year festival pleased many people, but few would have imagined that among the thousands of pigs supplied to the city, dozens were transported with the participation of Yu Yueze, Deputy Minister of the Finance and Trade Department of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

　　This happened on the evening of December 30th last year. Yu Yueze could have had a good rest as the holiday was approaching the next day, but he was concerned about the people who had been working day and night to transport pork throughout the year. Chongqing's population had increased by 230,000 last year, so the New Year supply task was particularly heavy. However, the Nanxi Breeding Farm, which was responsible for half of the city's pork supply, still had a large amount of pork piled up. If these meats were not quickly transported to the city, people celebrating the New Year would not be able to buy them.

　　That evening, Yu Yueze initiated the organization of a pork-carrying task force within the department, and more than 20 cadres immediately signed up. After selection, 14 strong individuals were chosen, including three section chiefs and several female comrades. They decided to give up their holiday and work with the employees at the Nanxi Breeding Farm for a day.

　　The next day, Yu Yueze and others started at 9 a.m., first carrying cured meat, and then helping in the slaughterhouse. They carried the freshly slaughtered and halved, bloody pigs on their shoulders, transporting dozens of them at once. The party branch secretary and all the employees of the breeding farm were deeply moved by their actions, and everyone came to help, quickly moving all the piled-up pork.

　　Why Weren't I Notified About the Truck?

　　The driver's office is often full of people, and the car drivers are studying how to use their spare time. Drivers Chen Songlin and Zhou Jingxing told reporters that recently, many responsible comrades of the Municipal Committee have not been taking official cars for personal matters and less urgent official business, but instead taking streetcars and buses. Those who go out on official business, whenever possible, mostly go collectively by truck. As a result, the Municipal Committee's cars are often idle, and the drivers are also taking on vehicle repair tasks when they have nothing else to do.

　　One secretary, who is older and often ill, has also reduced the number of times he uses an official car. Once, other responsible comrades of the Municipal Committee collectively took a truck to attend an evening party. The secretary, considering that it would be inconvenient for the secretary to take such a truck due to illness, did not notify him. The next day, he met the secretary and asked, "Why didn't you notify me to take the truck? Next time, I want to take it too."

　　A Secretary's Dormitory

　　The reporter visited the dormitory of a secretary of the Municipal Committee. In the bedroom, besides two beds, there are two sofas, a small table with five drawers, and a small wooden cabinet. Outside, there is an office with a desk, bookshelves, and two sofas; there is also a bed, which also serves as his daughter's bedroom.

　　The problem of "insufficient use" of houses and furniture has always been difficult for the Municipal Committee's organs to solve. After the launch of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the responsible comrades of the Municipal Committee took the lead in giving up houses. Two secretaries shared a building and vacated another. They both moved themselves on Sundays. As a result, those who previously complained about insufficient housing no longer do so. On the contrary, they have been actively returning surplus houses and furniture. The General Office of the Municipal Committee also organized cadres to visit factories and mines and residential areas in batches to observe the simple housing conditions of workers and residents, in order to inspire everyone to cultivate a hard-working and simple lifestyle.

### 中共重庆市委负责干部的新风气

    中共重庆市委负责干部的新风气
    在最近开展的增产节约运动中，中共重庆市委员会里出现了负责干部带头提倡艰苦朴素作风的新风气。下面就是记者采访时所搜集到的一部分具体事例：
        部长抬猪肉
    今年年节重庆市场猪肉的供应充裕而及时，许多人都感到满意，但是没有人会想到在全市供应的几千头猪中，有好几十头是由中共重庆市委财贸部副部长余跃泽参加搬运的。
    这是去年12月30日晚上的事，本来第二天就放假了，余跃泽可以好好休息一下，但是他却记挂着那些一年忙到头，还在夜以继日地搬运着猪肉的人们。重庆的人口在去年增加了二十三万，因此今年年节供应任务特别重。但是担负着全市猪肉供应任务一半的南溪饲养场还堆着大批猪肉，不设法赶快把这些肉运到市上，就会使过节的人们买不到肉。
    当晚，余跃泽便在部里发起组织一个搬肉的突击队，马上就有二十多个干部报名参加。经过挑选，选出了十四个身壮力强的人，其中有三位处长和几位女同志，他们决定放弃休假，到南溪饲养场同职工们一起工作一天。
    第二天余跃泽等人从上午九时开始，先抬腌肉，随后又到宰猪房帮忙。他们把刚杀后剖成两半边的血淋淋的猪，搬在肩上扛着就走，一下就搬了几十头。饲养场的党支部书记和全体职工对他们这种行动非常感动，大家也来帮忙搬，很快就把堆着的猪肉搬掉了。
    坐大卡车为什么不通知我？
    驾驶班的办公室里常常坐满了人，汽车司机们在这里研究着如何利用空闲的时间。司机陈松林、周景星告诉记者说，最近市委不少负责同志在办理私事和时间不十分紧迫的公事时都不坐公家的小汽车，而去坐电车、公共汽车。一些因公外出的人们，凡是能集中的，大都是集体坐卡车去。因此市委的汽车现在都老闲着，司机们没事就把修理车辆的事也担任起来。
    有一位书记本来年纪较大，并且多病，也减少了坐小汽车。有一次，市委其他负责同志集体坐卡车参加晚会，秘书因为考虑到这位书记有病坐这种车不方便，没有通知他。第二天他见到秘书，就问：“为什么不通知我坐大卡车？下一次我也要坐。”
      一个书记的宿舍
    记者参观了市委一位书记的宿舍。寝室里除了两张床外，就是两张沙发、一张五个抽斗的小桌和一个小木柜。外边一间办公室，摆着桌子、书架和两张沙发；也有一张床，原来这里还兼做他的女孩子的卧室。
    房子和家具的“不够使用”的问题，过去一直是市委机关感到难以解决的问题。增产节约运动开展后，市委负责同志便带头让出房子。两位书记并住了一栋房子，把另一栋房子腾出来。他们都是利用星期日自己动手搬的。这样，原来叫喊房子不够住的人再也不喊了。相反，都纷纷把多余的房子、家具退了出来。市委办公厅还组织干部分批到厂矿和街道参观职工和居民住房简朴的情况，以启发大家培养艰苦朴素的作风。（据新华社重庆讯）
