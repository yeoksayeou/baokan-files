Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, January 7th: The "Islah" newspaper said in its editorial on the 5th that the Middle East is the home of the Arabs and should be defended by them. Therefore, defense proposals should come from the Arabs, not from the United States.

The newspaper made these remarks when commenting on a new plan proposed by the U.S. President to invade Middle Eastern countries. When talking about the issue of "economic aid," "Islah" said that providing economic aid should not undermine the self-esteem and sovereignty of the recipient countries.

Xinhua News Agency, January 8th: Tokyo News: A spokesman for the Japanese Socialist Party attacked Eisenhower's Middle East policy address on the 6th. The Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Inajiro Asanuma, told a United Press reporter, "Mr. Eisenhower is asking for authorization, saying that it is to prevent war. However, I am worried that if this power is granted to the U.S. President and used improperly, it will result in triggering war."

Japanese newspapers on the 7th all emphasized the seriousness of Eisenhower's action in requesting the U.S. Congress to grant him freedom of decision-making in Middle East policy.

The "Mainichi Shimbun" published a commentary on the 7th stating that this decision by the United States is bound to intensify international tensions. It demanded that the United States consider how to solve the causes of the Middle East conflict, rather than threatening direct intervention.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 7th: Today's "Bintang Timur" published an editorial saying that the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" that the United States is trying to promote is merely a preparation to repeat the Korean War in the Middle East. The current actions of the United States in the Middle East are no different from what it did in Korea six years ago.

"Bintang Timur" praised the Indonesian government for its previous condemnation of the propaganda activities of some Western countries engaged in interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs. The newspaper believes that the government's action is in line with the wishes of the Indonesian people. This newspaper hopes that the government will also adopt the same attitude of opposing interference in internal affairs in international politics and openly condemn and oppose the policy of the American bloc to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.

Xinhua News Agency, January 7th: TASS Bangkok News: Thai newspapers commented on Eisenhower's Middle East problem message to Congress on the 5th, believing that it was a plan for a new colonialist offensive against Middle Eastern countries.

"Sathienraphap" wrote that the new attempt by the United States to interfere in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries is completely contrary to the desire of all countries for lasting peace. There is no doubt that it will further reduce the prestige of the United States.

"Thai Rath" pointed out that the so-called Eisenhower Doctrine means launching a cold war between countries.

    亚洲各国舆论评论
    “艾森豪威尔主义”是新殖民主义
    新华社喀布尔7日电　“革新报”5日社论说，中东是阿拉伯人的家乡，应该由他们自己来保卫，因此，防务建议应当来自阿拉伯人，而不应当来自美国。
    这家报纸是在评论美国总统提出的一项侵略中东国家的新计划时说这些话的。“革新报”在谈到“经济援助”问题时说，提供经济援助应该不损害受援国家的人民的自尊心和主权。
    据新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本社会党发言人在6日攻击艾森豪威尔的中东政策咨文。社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎对合众社记者说，
  “艾森豪威尔先生要求授权说是为了防止战争。然而我担心，如果把这种权力授予这位美国总统，而用得不得当的话，结果会挑起战争。”
    日本报纸7日都强调指出艾森豪威尔要求美国国会在中东政策方面给予他自由决定权这一行动的严重性。
      “每日新闻”7日发表的评论说，美国的这种决定必然会促使国际紧张局势加剧。它要求美国考虑如何解决中东冲突的成因，而不要威胁进行直接干涉。
    据新华社雅加达7日电　今天的“东星报”发表社论说，美国企图推行的所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”只是在中东重演朝鲜战争的准备工作。目前美国在中东的行径同六年前它在朝鲜所作的没有两样。
      “东星报”称赞印度尼西亚政府前发表的斥责一些西方国家从事干涉印度尼西亚内政的宣传活动。报纸认为政府的这一行动是符合于印度尼西亚人民的愿望的。这家报纸希望政府在国际政治方面也采取同样的反对干涉内政的态度，公开谴责和反对美国集团干涉别国内政的政策。
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社曼谷讯：泰国报纸评论艾森豪威尔5日致国会的中东问题咨文时认为，它是对中东各国进行新的殖民主义进攻的计划。
    “永恒报”写道，美国干涉中东国家内政的新企图与各国要求持久和平的愿望是完全对立的，毫无疑问，它必将使美国的威望进一步下降。
    “泰报”指出，所谓艾森豪威尔主义意味着掀起各国间的冷战。
