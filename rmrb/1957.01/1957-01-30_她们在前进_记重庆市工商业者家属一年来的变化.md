    They Are Advancing
    Record of Changes in Chongqing Industrialists' and Businessmen’s Families Over the Past Year

    Since the implementation of joint state-private ownership of all industries a year ago, the families of industrialists and businessmen in Chongqing have made great progress in all aspects, and profound changes have taken place in themselves and their families.

    Eight Pairs of Activist Couples

    Among the many industrialists' and businessmen’s family members who actively participate in social activities in Chongqing, eight couples were named activist members of the China Democratic National Construction Association last year. Yang Peizhen and her husband are one of these couples. Yang Peizhen now serves as the director of a branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association in Chongqing. These days, she is busy from morning till night formulating the branch's study and work plan for the first quarter of this year; she also has to contact family members and prepare for the distribution of mutual aid funds for the industrial and commercial sectors. Last year, when Yang Peizhen and her husband, Xue Yunlin, went to the industrial and commercial political school to study, both of them served as class leaders. They not only studied hard themselves, but also actively led many classmates to study well. Yang Peizhen also often publicizes the government's various policies and measures based on the personalities, thoughts, and family situations of the industrialists' and businessmen’s family members. These days, she is publicizing the significance of paying mutual aid funds in several industries. She said, "In the past, I really wanted to participate in agency work. Now I feel that social activities are very meaningful, and I am very happy to do this work."

    Yang Peizhen's husband, Xue Yunlin, was originally the manager of the Zhendan Fire Equipment Factory, but has now been appointed as the deputy manager of the state-owned Machinery and Electrical Appliance Industry Company, responsible for the production technology guidance of seventeen factories.

    The Boss’s Wife Becomes a Technician

    In the past, if you wanted to find the family members of industrialists and businessmen, you could just go to their homes. But now, some people have joined state-owned enterprises, agencies, and schools, and it is not easy to find them at their homes. He Yuxing, the wife of Qiu Heshou, the former director of the Risheng Machine Factory, is such a person. This mother of six children is now a third-grade lathe operator at the Chongqing Municipal Local State-Owned Fire Equipment Factory. He Yuxing told reporters that when she first walked into the workshop and asked the workers to teach her labor skills, the workers surprisingly gathered around and asked her: "Boss’s wife, aren't you afraid of getting dirty?" He Yuxing said that she was not afraid of getting dirty and could do it, but she was indeed struggling fiercely in her heart. She saw that the workers were covered in machine oil from head to toe, which was really dirty, but she still gritted her teeth and started working. She handed tools to the workers, held lamps, and did everything. Her desire to learn labor skills was welcomed by the workers. Many experienced masters taught her how to hammer, how to use a file, and even how to read blueprints and master lathe operation, starting to produce finished products.

    In April last year, He Yuxing was rated as a second-grade lathe operator. She said that since then, the workers have become more cordial to her and do not treat her as a capitalist's family member at all.

        Brother and Sister Reconciled

    In a joint clinic, the reporter met Guo Shirui, a family member of an industrialist and businessman. She is working here temporarily. She told me that the thing she was most happy about in the past year was that her brother and sister had reconciled.

    Guo Shirui's husband, Du Gang, used to run a large pharmacy. Her younger brother, Guo Kailong, worked as a clerk in the pharmacy before liberation. The siblings originally had a very good relationship. After liberation, Guo Kailong stood on the side of the working class and publicly struggled against the illegal actions of Du Gang and other capitalists several times. Guo Shirui was unhappy and stopped paying attention to Guo Kailong. In this way, although the siblings lived in the same enterprise, they were like passers-by and no longer interacted with each other. Guo Kailong never went to his sister's house to play again. The coldness between the siblings saddened their sixty-year-old mother, and Guo Shirui's children did not understand: "Why doesn't our uncle come to our house to play?"

    Last year, after studying at the Industrial and Commercial Political School, Guo Shirui began to recognize the ugly history of her husband's exploitation and realized that her brother was right to do so in the past. She took the initiative to greet her brother and invited him to play at her home. Now the siblings have reconciled. Guo Kailong works as a laboratory technician in a chemical factory in the suburbs. Whenever he comes to the city on holidays, he often visits his sister. He also takes the time to tutor his nephews and nieces and takes them to the streets to play and watch movies.

    There are countless examples of reconciliation between relatives and friends like Guo Shirui in Chongqing. Because industrialists and businessmen are determined to abandon exploitation, many children who have not returned home for a long time have returned, and relatives and friends who have not visited for a long time have also come to visit. The face of industrialists' and businessmen’s families is changing rapidly.

    Household Management Also Shows Progress

    Many family members of industrialists and businessmen are responsible for managing the household and educating their children. They are also making progress and are no less capable than other sisters. More than 900 family members of industrialists and businessmen who are engaged in housework are now participating in learning. Hu Daofen, the mother of fifteen children, personally takes care of the lives of nine children in addition to her six older children who are engaged in revolutionary work. She does her own laundry and cooking. In addition to educating her children and managing household affairs, Hu Daofen also takes the time to participate in various meetings and learning, and has made great progress.

    她们在前进
    记重庆市工商业者家属一年来的变化
    全行业公私合营一年来，重庆市工商业者的家属们在各方面都有很大进步，她们自己和她们的家庭都发生了深刻的变化。
    八对夫妻积极分子
    在重庆市许多积极参加社会活动的工商业者家属中，去年有八对夫妇被评为民主建国会的会员积极分子。杨培贞和她的丈夫就是其中的一对。杨培贞现在担任民建会重庆市的一个支部主任。这几天，她早出晚归忙着制订今年第一季度支部的学习和工作规划；她还要联系家属和准备发放工商界互助金。去年杨培贞和丈夫薛云麟一同到工商界政治学校学习时，夫妇二人都担任了班主任，他们不但自己努力学习，还积极领导许多同学学好。杨培贞平时还经常根据工商业者家属们的性格、思想和家庭情况宣传政府的各项政策措施，这几天她正在几个行业中宣传交纳互助金的意义。她说，过去我很想参加机关工作，现在感到社会活动很有意义，我很乐意做这些工作。
    杨培贞的丈夫薛云麟，原来是震旦消防器材厂的经理，现在已被任命为国营机械电器工业公司的副经理，担负十七个工厂的生产技术指导工作。
    老板娘变成了技工
    以前你如果要找工商业者家属，到她们家里去就行了，可是，现在有些人参加了国家企业、机关、学校工作，到她们家里就不容易找到她们了。原日生机器厂厂长丘鹤寿的妻子何玉兴就是这样一个人，这个六个孩子的妈妈，现在已经是重庆市地方国营消防器材厂的一个三级车工了。何玉兴告诉记者说，当她开始走进车间，要求工人教她劳动的本领的时候，工人们惊奇地围拢来问她：“老板娘，你不怕脏？”何玉兴嘴里说不怕脏，能够干下来，心里确实起着激烈的斗争。她看到工人们被机器油糊得满脸满身都是，真是脏得很，但是她还是咬紧牙巴，工作起来了。她给工人们递工具，提灯，什么都做。她的这种要求学会劳动本领的心愿，受到工人们的欢迎。许多老师傅教她怎样锤鎯头，怎样使用锉刀，一直到看图纸、掌握车床操作，开始生产成品。
    去年4月份何玉兴被评为二级车工。她说，那时起，工人们对她更加亲切了，完全不是把她当成是资本家的家属看待了。
        姐弟和好
    在一个联合诊疗所里，记者见到了工商业者家属郭士瑞，她在这里担任一个临时工作。她告诉我高潮一年以来，她最高兴的是她们姊弟二人和好了。
    郭士瑞的爱人杜刚过去开了个大药房，她的弟弟郭开龙解放前就在药房里当店员，姊弟俩感情原来很好。解放后，郭开龙站在工人阶级立场上，曾几次公开与杜刚等资本家的违法行为进行斗争，郭士瑞心里不高兴，从此不再理睬郭开龙了。这样，姊弟俩虽同住在一个企业里，却像过路人一样，彼此不再往来，郭开龙再也不上姊姊家里玩耍。姐弟间的冷淡引起了六十多岁的老母亲的伤心，郭士瑞的孩子们也不理解：“为什么我们的舅舅不到家里来玩呢？”
    去年，郭士瑞在工商政治学校学习后，开始认清丈夫剥削起家的丑恶历史，认识到自己的弟弟过去那样做是应该的，她便主动到弟弟面前问好，邀请弟弟到自己家玩。现在姊弟俩已经和好了，郭开龙在市郊一家化工厂担任化验员工作，每逢假日进城时，经常去探望姊姊，他还抽空教外甥们温习功课，带他们到街上游玩、看电影。
    重庆市像郭士瑞这样亲友和好的事例不知有多少，由于工商业者决心放弃剥削，不少家庭久不回家的子女回来了，长期不来的亲友也来访了，工商业者家庭的面貌正在迅速改变。
    理家也一样有进步
    许多工商业者家属担负理家和教育子女的工作，她们也一样在进步，并不比其他姊妹们逊色。全市现在有九百多个从事家务劳动的工商业者家属参加了学习。十五个孩子的妈妈胡道芬，除六个大孩子参加了革命工作外，她目前亲自照料九个孩子的生活，洗衣、做菜都是自己动手。胡道芬除了教育孩子、料理家务外，还抽空参加各种会议和学习，也有了很大的进步。
