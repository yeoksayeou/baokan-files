Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 7th: Following Eisenhower's special message to Congress on the 5th regarding the new Middle East plan, many Democratic and even Republican members of Congress have expressed serious concerns about the plan and have called for a comprehensive discussion of the government's Middle East policy.

Senator Kefauver, a former Democratic vice-presidential candidate, said on the evening of the 6th that he believes Eisenhower's Middle East proposal is "full of explosives," and "the more I study these proposals, the more I oppose them." He said that the President's economic proposals "may have merit," but militarily, he is worried about giving power to Secretary of State Dulles because he believes Dulles is too fond of "saber-rattling."

Senator Ellender, a Democrat who consistently criticizes foreign "aid," said, "This is the starting signal for another huge foreign aid program," and "it will widen the rift between the United States and Russia, and in my opinion, will lead to a third world war."

Representative Hebert said, "I remain steadfastly opposed to expanding the power to allow honest American youth to be sent to any foreign country to die."

Democratic Senators Johnston, Irwin, and Republican Senator Goldwater, among others, opposed granting the President the kind of unlimited power he requested.

Senator Mansfield said he had "serious doubts" about the government's Middle East proposal because it does not address the fundamental problems in the Middle East, such as the Suez issue and the Palestinian issue.

The Democratic National Advisory Committee issued a statement stating that the President's new Middle East policy is "an incomplete remedy after the fact," and that the government has "jumped from difficult situations into more difficult situations," failing to rebuild the Western alliance and restore American prestige and leadership.

According to "New York Times" Washington correspondent White, Eisenhower's proposal "was received coldly in Congress." Democratic members of Congress "displayed extremely obvious, almost indifferent, caution" towards the President's plan. As for Republican members of Congress, "although they are generally more accepting of what the President has to say, they have shown no active enthusiasm."

    “艾森豪威尔主义”包藏炸药
    美国很多议员表示疑惧
    据新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：在艾森豪威尔5日向国会提出关于中东新计划的特别咨文以后，很多民主党以至共和党的国会议员对这个计划表示严重的疑惧，并且要求对政府的中东政策进行全面的讨论。
    曾任民主党副总统候选人的参议员克弗维尔在6日晚上说，他认为艾森豪威尔的中东建议“充满着炸药”，“我愈研究这些建议，我就愈反对它们”。他说，总统提出的关于经济方面的建议“可能有优点”，但是在军事方面，他担心把权力交给国务卿杜勒斯，因为他认为杜勒斯太喜欢“剑拔弩张了。”
    一贯批评对外“援助”的民主党参议员埃伦德说，“这是另一个巨大的援外计划的开始信号”，“它将扩大美国和俄国间的裂痕，在我看来将导致第三次世界大战”。
    众议员希伯特说：“我坚持不变地反对扩大允许把诚实的美国青年派到任何外国去送死的权力。”
    民主党参议员约翰斯顿、欧文及共和党议员戈德华特等人都反对授予总统所要求的那种无限权力。
    参议员曼斯菲尔德说，他对政府的中东建议是感到“严重怀疑”的，因为这个建议并不能解决中东的基本问题，例如苏伊士问题和巴勒斯坦问题。
    美国民主党全国谘询委员会发表声明，认为总统的中东新政策是“一种不彻底的亡羊补牢的办法”，政府已经“从困难的处境又跳进困难的处境中去”，它没有设法重建西方国家联盟和恢复美国的威信和领导地位。
    据“纽约时报”驻华盛顿记者怀特说，总的说来，艾森豪威尔的建议“在国会是受到冷淡的对待的”。民主党议员对总统的计划“表现出极其明显的、几乎是冷淡的慎重态度”。至于共和党议员，他们“虽然一般说来比较能够接受总统所要说的话，但是，他们绝没有表现出积极的精神。”
