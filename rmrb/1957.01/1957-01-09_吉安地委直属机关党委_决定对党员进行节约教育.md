    Ji'an Prefectural Committee Directly Subordinate to the Party Committee
    Decides to Educate Party Members on Thrift
    (Our newspaper's report) According to the Jiangxi Daily: The Party Committee directly subordinate to the Ji'an Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at a joint meeting of branch secretaries of various organs held on December 27, 1956, decided to conduct extensive and in-depth ideological education on increasing production and practicing economy, and striving hard among Party members and cadres in the organs.
    The meeting reflected that in recent years, some comrades, in the peaceful construction environment, especially after the wage reform, have shown some new and unfavorable tendencies. Some units are very small, but they learn from the big organs to purchase loudspeakers and build lighted ball fields. Some comrades covet a comfortable life, are not hardworking in their work, are unwilling to go to the countryside, and are accustomed to sitting in the organs listening to reports, approving official documents, and issuing instructions.
    Therefore, the meeting decided that each organ branch must, in accordance with the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, rapidly and extensively conduct education on increasing production and practicing economy, and striving hard among all Party members and cadres, and establish the fine style of relying on the masses and sharing weal and woe with them.

    吉安地委直属机关党委
    决定对党员进行节约教育
    本报讯　据江西日报消息：中共吉安地委直属机关委员会，在1956年12月27日召开的各机关支部书记联席会议上，决定在机关党员和干部中广泛深入地进行增产节约、艰苦奋斗的思想教育。
    会议反映，近年来有部分同志在和平的建设环境中，特别是在工资改革以后，出现了一些新的不良的倾向。有的单位很小，也学大机关的样子，购买扩音器、修灯光球场。有些同志贪图生活安逸，工作不艰苦，不愿下乡，习惯于坐在机关听汇报、批公文、发指示。
    因此，会议决定：各机关支部必须根据八届二中全会的精神，迅速向全体党员、干部广泛深入地进行增产节约、艰苦奋斗的教育，树立依靠群众，与群众同甘苦的艰苦朴素的作风。
