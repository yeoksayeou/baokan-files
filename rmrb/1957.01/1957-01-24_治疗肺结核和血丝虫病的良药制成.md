Effective Medicines for Treating Tuberculosis and Filariasis Developed

    (Our Dispatch) "Cyacetacide," an effective medicine for treating tuberculosis that China has not been able to produce in the past, has been successfully trial-produced at the Nanjing Pharmaceutical Factory. "Hetrazan," a special medicine for treating filariasis, has begun to be mass-produced at this factory.

    Neither of these two drugs has been produced in China before, and "Cyacetacide" has not even been imported from abroad. In the first quarter of last year, engineers Ni Guangxian and technician Wu Peiying from this factory began to trial-produce Cyacetacide. They overcame difficulties such as insufficient technical data, equipment, and experience, and experimented continuously for more than four months, failing more than 120 times before finally achieving success. After several months of clinical trials and animal experiments by the Wuxi Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Institute, this drug has proven to have good results in treating early-stage tuberculosis. In treating late-stage lung disease, its effectiveness can also match that of "Isoniazid," one of the current drugs for treating tuberculosis, and its toxicity is only one-tenth of that of "Isoniazid." Currently, the factory's technicians are continuing to combine clinical trials to further improve the quality, and it is expected that production can begin in the second half of this year.

    "Hetrazan," which was successfully trial-produced by this factory last year, has begun to be mass-produced. The imported price of this drug is more than twelve yuan per hundred tablets, while the ex-factory price of the same quantity of drugs produced by this factory is only more than two yuan. However, currently, one hundred jin of raw materials can only produce about fifty jin of drugs. They are studying improvements to increase the yield rate and further reduce costs.

### 治疗肺结核和血丝虫病的良药制成

    治疗肺结核和血丝虫病的良药制成
    本报讯　我国过去一向不能自制的治疗肺结核病良药“氰乙醯井”，已在南京制药厂试制成功。治疗血丝虫病的特效药“海群生”已开始在这个厂大量生产。
    这两种药品我国过去从未生产过，而“氰乙醯井”连国外也没有进口。去年第一季度，这个厂的工程师倪广仙和技术员邬佩英，开始试制氰乙醯井。他们克服了技术资料、设备和经验不足的困难，陆续试验了四个多月，前后失败一百二十多次，终于获得了成功。这种药品经过无锡肺结核防治院几个月的临床试验和动物试验，证明治疗初期肺结核的效果良好，治疗后期肺病，其效果也可以赶上目前治疗肺结核药品之一“异烟肼”，而且毒性只有“异烟肼”的十分之一。目前这个厂的技术人员正在继续结合临床试验，进一步提高质量，预计在今年下半年即可开始生产。
    这个厂去年就已试制成功的“海群生”已开始大量生产。这种药品进口价格每百粒要十二元多，而这个厂生产的同样数量的药品，出厂价格只有二元多。但是，现在投下一百斤原料还只能制成五十斤左右的药品。他们正在研究改进，提高制成率，进一步降低成本。
