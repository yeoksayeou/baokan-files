Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 29th. Czechoslovak President Sapotocky held a grand banquet at the Czechoslovak Embassy in the Soviet Union on the 28th, for the Czechoslovak Republic delegation's visit to the Soviet Union.

Invited to the banquet were: Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union; Bulganin, Mikoyan, Molotov, Suslov, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Furtseva, Shvernik, Aristov, Belyayev, ministers of the Soviet government, and senior generals of the Soviet Army, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Soviet Union.

At this banquet, which was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere, President Sapotocky spoke first.

	Sapotocky's Speech

Sapotocky said that our relations with the Soviet Union are socialist relations based on equality, cooperation, and mutual assistance. Some people in certain capitalist countries in the West believe that our relations with the Soviet Union are unequal, and often say that we must be "liberated." They even hint that as long as our communism is different, for example, nationalistic, liberal, in short, as long as the degree of communism is not so deep, then it can be accepted by the governments of capitalist countries. I would like to say to those who have such ideas that they are racking their brains and wasting their time in vain.

We can say to all the people, to the public all over the world, with full responsibility: "The friendly and allied relations between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union are built on the solid and unshakable foundation of autonomy, equality, non-interference, mutual respect, cooperation, and fraternal assistance."

This relationship has brought and will continue to bring countless benefits to our two countries, benefiting the common cause in many ways. All our people, regardless of party affiliation, know these facts. Therefore, representatives of all parties in the National Front participated in this Moscow negotiation, and they are fully determined to strengthen the alliance with the Soviet Union in the future in order to strengthen peace and build socialism.

	Voroshilov's Speech

Voroshilov then spoke. He said that you have given a just rebuttal to the rumors spread by those chattering people across the ocean. The deeper our friendship, the greater our contribution to the interests of our people and the cause of world peace, the more vicious the lies will be.

Voroshilov emphasized that the friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia has withstood many tests, and it has become more consolidated and solid. We have had many difficulties and hardships, but they have only brought us closer together. The Soviet people are very willing to introduce their experience to the Czechoslovak people, and at the same time, they are ready to absorb all their valuable and advanced things. We are proud of our friendship that is loyal to the cause of socialism.

The speeches of President Sapotocky and Chairman Voroshilov were constantly interrupted by warm applause.

At the end of the banquet, Soviet and Czechoslovak politicians circled the hall, at which point the attendees burst into loud cheers, shouts of "Hurrah!" and cheers of "Long live Soviet-Czechoslovak friendship!" resounded.

    萨波托斯基为捷代表团访苏举行宴会
    两国领导人强调发展捷苏友谊
    新华社莫斯科29日电　捷克斯洛伐克总统萨波托斯基为捷克斯洛伐克共和国代表团在苏联进行访问，28日在捷克斯洛伐克驻苏联大使馆举行了盛大的宴会。
    应邀参加宴会的有：苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫、布尔加宁、米高扬、莫洛托夫、苏斯洛夫、赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、福尔采娃、什维尔尼克、阿里斯托夫、别利亚耶夫，苏联政府的部长和苏军高级将领，以及各国驻苏联的外交使节。
    在这个充满着热诚和友好气氛的宴会上，萨波托斯基总统首先讲了话。
        萨波托斯基的讲话
    萨波托斯基说，我们同苏联的关系是以平等、合作和互助为基础的社会主义关系。西方某些资本主义国家内有人认为我们同苏联的关系不平等，常说必须“解放”我们。他们甚至暗示，只要我们的共产主义是另一个样子，比如说是民族主义的、自由主义的，简言之，只要共产主义的程度不那么深，那就可以为资本主义国家的政府所接受。我想对那些有这种想法的人说，他们在自伤脑筋，白白浪费时间。
    我们可以向全体人民，向全世界的公众完全负责地说：“捷克斯洛伐克和苏联之间的友好和同盟关系是建立在自主、平等、不干涉、互相尊重、合作和兄弟援助的巩固的和不可动摇的基础上的。”
    这种关系已经给我们两个国家带来了而且还将不断带来有益于共同事业的、多方面的数不尽的利益。我们全体人民，不论属于什么党派，都知道这些事实。因此，参加这次莫斯科谈判的有民族阵线中各党派的代表，他们抱有充分的决心，为了加强和平和建设社会主义，今后还要加强同苏联的联盟。
        伏罗希洛夫的讲话
    伏罗希洛夫接着讲了话。他说，你们对大洋彼岸那些喋喋不休的人所散布的谣言作了公正的反驳。我们的友谊越深，我们对本国人民的利益和世界和平的利益贡献越大，恶毒的谎言也就越多。
    伏罗希洛夫强调说，苏捷两国人民的友谊经受了许多的考验，它已经变得更加巩固和坚实了。我们有过许多困难和患难，但是，它们只使我们更加接近、亲密起来。苏联人民很乐意把自己的经验介绍给捷克斯洛伐克人民，同时也随时吸取了他们的一切宝贵和先进的东西。我们为我们忠于社会主义事业的友谊而自豪。
    萨波托斯基总统和伏罗希洛夫主席的讲话不断被热烈的掌声所打断。
    宴会结束的时候，苏联和捷克斯洛伐克的政治家们绕场一周，这时到会者发出响亮的欢呼声，“乌拉”声和欢呼“苏捷友谊万岁”的声音响成一片。
