	Going to the Countryside and Not Going to the Countryside
	Su Ren
	Recently, newspapers across the country have been using large headlines in prominent positions to publish news about cadres going to the countryside. Seeing the current momentum of cadres going to the countryside, I can't help but recall the exciting scene of large numbers of cadres going to the countryside during the land reform. At that time, batches of cadres went to the countryside with the determination to win, relied on the masses, and quickly completed the historical task of land reform. Afterwards, everyone talked about the land reform period with great relish and pride.

	Now cadres are going to the countryside to complete an even greater historical task than land reform—building a new socialist countryside. In many upper-level agencies, there are a group of good cadres who love the countryside and yearn to work in the countryside. I have personally met such good comrades. One comrade, who is now the director of a county party committee office, was originally a district party committee secretary and was only transferred to the county party committee last June. In the agency, he very much missed the rural work he was familiar with and missed the local masses and cadres. He repeatedly asked the county party committee to let him go to the countryside, even if it was for three days, five days, or even just one night. Once, he went to the several townships where he used to work and, in just five days, helped the township and commune cadres solve many problems and brought back a wealth of materials, all of which were new issues of great help to the county party committee in guiding its work at the time. Another comrade I met was working as a secretary in a certain agency. In addition to him, there was another secretary in this agency. He himself only handled one or two simple administrative matters each day, spending three-quarters of his time reading books and newspapers. He reported to his superiors once and twice, asking to return to the countryside. However, the leadership, in order to "reserve cadres," would not let him go, wanting him to settle down. How could he settle down? Sitting in the agency, watching time being wasted, while the rural work he was familiar with urgently needed someone like him to go down and help.

	I believe that if such comrades return to work in the countryside, they will definitely be greatly welcomed by township and commune cadres. They themselves will also fully play their role.

	However, I have also heard and seen cadres who evade going to the countryside. A cadre in the Hunan Provincial-level agency was assigned to Changsha County. The county party committee assigned him to go to the countryside, but he refused. The county leaders talked to him five times, but it didn't work. What were his reasons? First, he had a newlywed lover in the city, and second, he had an elderly mother in the city. Another cadre made a condition to the county party committee, saying that he could go to the countryside, but only to the rural areas closest to the city.

	Do these cadres really want to go to the countryside to share weal and woe with the masses and do some practical work for them? What exactly is it that has blinded their eyes and bound their hands and feet? It really deserves a thorough examination.

    下乡和不下乡
    苏人
    最近，各地报纸上都用大字标题，在显著地位刊登干部下乡的消息。看到现在干部下乡的声势，我不禁想起土地改革时大批干部下乡的那种令人兴奋的情景。那时，成批干部抱着必胜的决心到农村去，依靠了群众，很快地完成了土地改革的历史任务。以后，大家谈起土地改革时期的事情来，都是津津乐道，引以为荣。
    现在干部下乡是为了完成比土地改革更伟大的历史任务——建设社会主义的新农村。在很多上层机关里，都有一批热爱农村、渴望到农村工作的好干部。我就亲自接触过这样的好同志。有一位现在担任县委办公室主任的同志，他原来是区委书记，去年6月才上调县委机关来。他在机关里非常怀念他所熟悉的农村工作，怀念当地的群众和干部们。他屡次要求县委让他下乡去，那怕是三天、五天，甚至一个晚上也好。有一次，他到原来工作的那几个乡去，仅仅有五天时间，就帮助乡、社干部解决了很多问题，带回了丰富的材料，都是对县委指导当时工作有重大帮助的新问题。另外见到一位同志，他在某机关担任秘书工作。这个机关除他之外，还有一位秘书，他自己每天只处理一两件简单的行政上的事情，四分之三的时间是用来看书看报的。他一次、两次地向领导上打报告，要求让他回到农村去。可是领导上为了“储备干部”，怎么也不放松他，要他安下心来。他怎么能安心呢，坐在机关里眼看时间白白浪费了，而他所熟悉的农村工作，又迫切需要像他这样的人下去帮助。
    我相信，这样的同志再回到农村去工作，一定是会受到乡、社干部大大欢迎的。他们自己也将充分发挥他们的作用。
    可是，我也听人说过和见到逃避下乡的干部。湖南省省级机关有一个干部分配到长沙县，县委分配他下乡，他不去；县里负责人和他谈话五次之多，还不行。他有什么理由呢？第一是有个新婚的爱人在城里，第二城里还有个老母亲。另一个干部向县委提出条件说，下乡可以，但要到靠城市最近的农村。
    这些干部究竟是不是真的想下乡去同群众同甘共苦、并且切切实实地为他们做些工作？究竟是什么东西迷住了他们的眼睛，缚住了他们的手足。实在是大可以检查的。
