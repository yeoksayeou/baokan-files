Xinhua News Agency, 7th: Many dependents of officers stationed with troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are doing well in their work and studies.

The organs and units of the PLA attach great importance to organizing the work and study of the dependents of officers stationed with troops. Many organs and units have helped them establish women's committees and helped them participate in various suitable social labors, such as organizing sewing groups, laundry groups, or shoe-making groups. Some participate in agricultural production cooperatives or handicraft production cooperatives in their places of residence. Some officers' dependents with considerable cultural level and professional ability are recruited to work in units such as organs, troops' servicemen supply agencies, and officers' clubs. In addition to working and taking care of housework, these officers' dependents organize themselves to study politics and culture. In order to enable them to work and study with peace of mind, some organs and units have established nurseries to relieve the wives of officers with many children of their burdens.

Many officers' dependents are working and studying well. The officers' dependents in the Xinjiang Military Region's troops have achieved "six goods," namely: good unity and mutual assistance among family and neighbors; good at diligence and thrift in managing the household; good at raising children; good at encouraging their spouses to work and study; good at their own labor and study, etc.

Many troops' officers' dependents also care about the lives of the soldiers together with the officers. They often help the soldiers with washing and mending, and boiling water and cooking. Eleven officers' dependents of a unit stationed on Hainan Island reclaimed a wasteland last year, harvesting more than 7,900 kilograms of vegetables, improving the soldiers' meals. Some units' officers' dependents also take time to rehearse literary and artistic programs and perform for the soldiers at weekend evening parties.

    解放军随军军官家属
    工作好学习也好
    据新华社7日讯　中国人民解放军的许多随军军官家属，工作和学习得很好。
    解放军各机关、部队很重视组织随军军官家属的工作和学习。许多机关、部队都帮助她们成立了妇女委员会，并帮助她们参加各种适宜的社会劳动，如组织缝衣组、洗衣组或制鞋组等，有的参加到驻地农业生产合作社或手工业生产合作社去劳动。一些具有相当文化水平和业务能力的军官家属，被吸收到机关、部队的军人供应社、军官俱乐部等单位工作。在工作和料理家务之余，这些军官家属们便组织起来学习政治和文化。为了使她们安心地工作和学习，有些机关、部队成立了托儿所，让子女多的军官妻子免去牵累。
    许多军官家属工作、学习得很好。新疆军区部队中的军官家属们做到“六好”，即：家庭、邻居团结互助好；勤俭持家好；孩子养得好；鼓励爱人工作、学习好；自己劳动、学习好等。
    许多部队的军官家属还和军官们一起关怀着士兵的生活。她们经常帮助士兵们洗洗补补，烧水做饭。驻海南岛一支部队的十一个军官家属，去年自己开垦一片荒地，收获了七千九百多斤蔬菜，给士兵改善了伙食。有些单位的军官家属还抽空排演文艺节目，在周末晚会上为士兵演出。
