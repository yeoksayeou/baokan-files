    Thought of Saving Money That Didn't Need to Be Spent
    Tractor Factory Cuts Administrative Expenses by More Than 4 Million
    (Our newspaper's report) The Luoyang Tractor Manufacturing Plant, in the spirit of thrift, has reduced its administrative expenses for 1957 by more than 4 million yuan.
    This year, the state's investment in the construction of the Luoyang Tractor Factory has been reduced by two-thirds compared to the factory's original plan. Therefore, in addition to making appropriate reductions in the civil engineering and installation projects for 1957, the factory has also strictly controlled administrative expenses. The Education Department originally planned to buy a movie projector but decided not to, as the trade union already has one that can be used; the Administrative Department originally planned to buy a transportation vehicle, four jeeps, and two small station wagons, but now it has also decided not to buy them; a batch of desks originally planned to be specially purchased for department heads and workshop directors has also been changed to ordinary desks; a batch of coir beds originally planned to be purchased has been changed to wooden plank beds. In addition, items such as cameras and file cabinets that were planned to be purchased have also been reduced considerably. The total reduction is more than 4 million yuan. (Tang Fengji)

    想到把可以不花的钱省下来
    拖拉机厂削减行政费四百多万
    本报讯　洛阳拖拉机制造厂根据节约精神，削减了1957年行政开支四百多万元。
    今年，国家对洛阳拖拉机厂的建设投资较原来厂里所订的计划减少了三分之二。为此，厂里除了对1957年土建、安装项目作了适当的削减外，对行政费用的开支也作了严格的控制。教育处原计划要买的电影机决定不买了，工会原有一部可以调剂使用；行政处原来计划要买一部交通车、四部吉普车、两辆小卧车，现在也决定不买了；原来计划要为处长和车间主任特购的一批办公桌子，也决定改为普通桌子；原计划购置的一批棕床，决定改为木板床。此外如计划添置的照像机、资料柜等，也都削掉了不少。共计削减在四百万元以上。（唐凤纪）
