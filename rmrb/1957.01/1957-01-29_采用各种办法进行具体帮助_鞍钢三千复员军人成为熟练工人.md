Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, January 27th. In 1956, Anshan Iron and Steel Works' factories and mines helped many demobilized soldiers master skills through various methods such as running training classes, attending workers' technical schools, and establishing apprenticeship contracts. According to statistics, among the more than seven thousand demobilized soldiers in Anshan Iron and Steel Works, more than three thousand two hundred have been trained to become skilled technical workers.

　　Last year, the Chemical Plant received 161 demobilized soldiers, of whom 67 were assigned to key positions in various workshops. With the help of experienced workers, they quickly learned the skills and are now skilled coke pusher drivers, blower drivers, or coke oven fire watchers. The others have also become production workers. At the end of last year, 152 people passed the examination and were promoted. The Transportation Department sent 336 of the 378 newly received demobilized soldiers last year to workers' technical schools, where they studied for three to six months. Then they were helped to sign contracts with experienced workers to learn to be train drivers, shunters, and bulldozer and crane operators.

　　When assigning work, these units also appropriately considered their original skills and aspirations. For example, Zhao Youlin repaired machinery in the army, and he was allowed to repair machines after arriving at the factory. In more than a year, his skills quickly reached the level of an eighth-grade worker, and he also became a squad leader.

　　The demobilized soldiers who mastered the skills have made great achievements in their work. Fan Guangquan, a demobilized soldier and driver, leads locomotive No. 243, which has safely traveled more than 200,000 kilometers. Cui Zhilin, who was demobilized in April last year, was able to independently operate a pulverizer in just over twenty days. In January of this year, the qualification rate of the coal he pulverized reached 100%. In January, 25 units of Anshan Iron and Steel Works successively held meetings of demobilized soldier activists. At the meeting, 523 demobilized soldiers were rewarded for their outstanding achievements.

    采用各种办法进行具体帮助
    鞍钢三千复员军人成为熟练工人
    新华社鞍山27日电　在1956年里，鞍钢各厂、矿通过开办训练班、进工人技术学校学习和订立师徒合同等方式，帮助很多复员军人掌握了技术。据统计，在鞍钢的七千多名复员军人中，有三千二百多人已被培养成为熟练的技术工人。
    化工总厂去年接收了一百六十一名复员军人，其中有六十七人被分配到各车间的主要岗位上。他们在老师傅的帮助下很快学会了技术，现在已是熟练的推焦车司机、鼓风机司机，或是炼焦炉的看火工人。其他的也都成了生产工人。去年年底，有一百五十二人通过考试升了级。运输部将去年新接收的三百七十八名复员军人中的三百三十六人送入了工人技术学校，学习了三个月至半年以后，又帮助他们和老师傅订立了包教保学合同，学习火车司机、调车员和推土机、吊车司机等工作。
    在分配工作时，这些单位还适当地照顾了他们原有的技术和志愿。如赵有林在部队里时是修理机械的，到工厂后还让他修理机器。一年多时间，他的技术很快就达到了八级工的水平，还当了班长。
    掌握了技术的复员军人在工作中作出了很大的成绩。复员军人、司机长樊广全领导的二百四十三号机车已安全运行了二十多万公里。去年4月复员的崔治林，只有二十多天功夫就能独立操纵一台粉碎机。今年1月份，他粉碎的煤粒度合格率达到100％。在1月份里，鞍钢有二十五个单位先后举行了复员军人积极分子会议。会上，有五百二十三名复员军人因有卓越的成就得到了奖励。
