Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 11th: The first Southwest National Painting Exhibition showcases many new works by veteran national painters who have not painted for a long time, or rarely painted. Among the three hundred plus artists participating in the exhibition, more than thirty are elderly painters over sixty years old. The veteran painter Wang Jianbai selected several of his new works from 1956, such as "Vase of Flowers," for the exhibition. Painters such as Bu Zhenyu, Xiao Shiying, and Gui Baizhu are already in their seventies or eighties, and this exhibition features their recent landscape and flower-and-bird paintings. The painting exhibition also includes "Li Bai Drunk Enters the Palace" by a ninety-four-year-old painter, Zhang Zhifu, and "Female Student Saves Child from Danger," a work based on the heroic story of Wang Yuanai. Many national painters over fifty years old also went deep into construction sites, rural areas, or places with beautiful scenery to experience life and sketch.

The five hundred plus works exhibited were selected from more than 1,100 works sent from Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou and other provinces. In addition to many new works by veteran national painters, there are also excellent works by many newly emerging young artists.

The National Painting Exhibition was on display in Chongqing for a month and ended on the 9th. Soon, it will be transported to Xi'an, Guiyang and other places for exhibition.
