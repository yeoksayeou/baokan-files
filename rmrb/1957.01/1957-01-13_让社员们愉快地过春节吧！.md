Let the Commune Members Enjoy the Spring Festival!
	Last year, cadres in some agricultural cooperatives in Hebei Province, in order to carry out the manure collection campaign, did not allow commune members to rest properly even during the Spring Festival. Commune members worked all day on "New Year's Eve" and were not allowed to rest on "New Year's Day." Many commune members were very dissatisfied with this. Some commune members said, "Even old oxen and horses get two days off for the New Year, why aren't we allowed to rest!" Others said, "Students and cadres get holidays, why don't farmers get even one day off?"
	The commune members' request is justified. Every farmer in our country hopes to have a good, happy, and joyful rest during the Spring Festival. Especially in recent years, with the development of agricultural collectivization and the increase in agricultural production, farmers' incomes have increased year by year, and everyone is even happier during the Spring Festival. It is hoped that cadres in various regions will respect the wishes of the farmers and allow them to have a more enjoyable Spring Festival.　Leng Shui
	In the vast rural areas of Hunan, from the first to the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, farmers often voluntarily pool the little money they save to perform dragon lantern and flower lantern dances. Men, women, young and old, all enjoy these activities.
	In recent years, these activities have often been prohibited because of the emphasis on frugality and "crash" preparations for spring plowing and production. Some areas even call the farmers up for "crash" production on the first day of the New Year, not allowing them to rest for even one day.
	Calling for frugality and striving for production are both good and necessary. However, during the Spring Festival, allowing farmers to engage in activities that they enjoy is something that should be permitted.
	The year before last, on the first day of the New Year, I went to my grandmother's house. Because it was far away, I didn't return home until the next day. It so happened that the township was carrying out a crash campaign and asked me to attend a meeting. The day after I returned home, I was called to a meeting and even criticized by the Youth League branch secretary, who said that I "didn't pay attention to the central task."
	Is there anything wrong with using legal holidays to visit relatives? I also often hear farmers say, "Now it's really gone - no New Year's Eve, no New Year's Day, no flavor at all."
	Now the Spring Festival is approaching again, and it is hoped that various regions will allow farmers time during the Spring Festival to visit relatives and friends and enjoy the dragon lantern dances they like.

### 让社员们愉快地过春节吧！

    让社员们愉快地过春节吧！
    去年，河北省有些农业社的干部，为了开展积肥运动，在春节那几天也不让社员们好好休息一下。社员们在“腊月三十”干一天活，“大年初一”还不许休息。许多社员因此很不满意。有的社员说：“老牛老马过年还要歇两天，为啥不叫俺休息一下！”有的说：“学生、干部都放假，为啥农民一天也不叫歇？”
    社员们的这个要求是正当的。我国农民谁也希望在春节痛痛快快欢欢乐乐地休息一下，尤其近几年来，随着农业合作化的发展和农业生产的提高，农民的收入逐年增多，大家在过春节时就更加高兴。希望各地干部尊重农民的愿望，让农民把春节过得更愉快些。　冷水
    湖南广大农村中，每到农历正月初一到十五，农民们常常自动把自己节约下来的一点钱凑起来，耍一耍龙灯和花灯。男女老少都喜欢这些活动。
    近年来，有些地区因为强调节约和“突击”春耕生产准备工作，这种活动往往受到禁止。有些地区甚至大年初一就把农民叫起来“突击”生产，不让他们休息一天。
    号召节约和努力生产都是好的、应该的。但是在春节期间，让农民们自己搞一搞他们喜闻乐见的活动，是应该允许的。
    前年春节，大年初一那天，我到外婆家去了，因路远，第二天才回家。恰好乡上在搞突击工作，找我开会。第二天我一回到家里，就被叫去开会，还受到团支部书记的批评，说我“对中心工作不重视”。
    利用法定的休假日子去给亲戚拜拜年有什么不可以呢？我也常听到农民说：“现在真是三十初一都没有了，没得味。”
    现在春节又快到了，希望各地能让农民们在春节中有时间去向亲友拜拜年、玩玩自己喜欢的龙灯。
