    Work for the Party Like Guo Mingchang
    Lin Hong

    Our cause has already achieved great success, but there is still much arduous and heavy work waiting for us to do; our living and working conditions are improving day by day, but there are still many people whose lives are not prosperous, and many people are working in difficult circumstances. This requires every Communist Party member to maintain and carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and plain living, and to maintain and carry forward the fine style of sharing weal and woe with the people. Only in this way can we influence and drive the broad masses of the people and more effectively promote the country's construction cause.

    Within our Party, there are many comrades who have not become unwilling to do arduous work because of the victory of our cause, and have not forgotten the people because they have become responsible cadres. Many of these are veteran cadres, and many are new cadres. Guo Mingchang, the public-private joint venture Yongda Cotton Ginning Factory's public-side Deputy Director, who was introduced on page 4 of this newspaper on January 25 under the title "The Pioneer," is one of these many Communist Party members. This comrade excellently completed the tasks assigned to him by the Party under difficult conditions, turning a filthy factory into a clean factory, and a seriously loss-making factory into a profitable factory. On a national scale, a factory with only thirty-eight workers and four old cotton gins being run well may not be a great thing; but the excellent qualities and style that Comrade Guo Mingchang demonstrated in his work are worthy of learning for all our Communist Party members and revolutionary workers.

    What we should first learn from Comrade Guo Mingchang is his spirit of not fearing difficulties and not fearing hardship, which is especially valuable in the period of peaceful construction. Because in the period of peaceful construction, people can easily develop the idea of ​​seeking comfort and being unwilling to do arduous work. For example, recently, in order to strengthen the Party's leadership over rural work, many places have transferred a group of cadres from leading organs to work in rural grass-roots organizations, asking them to settle down there. While many people happily obeyed the organization's assignment, some were unwilling to go to work in the countryside on the grounds that they were "not familiar with the rural situation." In essence, they were afraid of the hard life in the countryside, and their enthusiasm for the revolutionary cause had become increasingly weak. But Comrade Guo Mingchang was not like this at all. The place where the Party organization and the government assigned him to work was not only a factory with outdated and backward equipment, but also a factory where almost every corner was piled with dirty things and filled with a pungent stench. This scene also made Comrade Guo Mingchang waver, but concern for the Party's cause and love for the workers quickly made him firm and happily took up his post. The reason why he was willing to work in places that others might not be willing to go to was because he understood that although the environment of that factory was very dirty and the work was very difficult; it was a position that the Party must occupy, and if he—a Communist Party member trusted by the Party—did not occupy this position, who would occupy it? If he was frightened back by maggots, flies, and stench, what kind of Communist Party member would he be? It was precisely because he had the sense of responsibility that a Communist Party member should have and the virtue of actively working for the Party that he was able to roll up his sleeves, put on a mask, and clean up the leftover food in the kitchen for the workers; that he was able to dig up maggots and kill flies with the workers; that he was able to love the factory as he loved his home, and think of the factory and the workers in every way. And his efforts really yielded good results. Not only were the environmental hygiene and working conditions of the factory quickly improved, but under the influence of his excellent style, the workers' thinking also changed, and the workers' labor productivity increased sharply!

    The source of our strength comes from the people, and the victory of our cause mainly comes from the support of the people. But if we do not care about the people's lives and are indifferent to the people's suffering, even if we shout about maintaining close ties with the masses every day, the masses will not be of one heart with us. Therefore, maintaining and carrying forward the Party's fine style of caring about the people's lives and sharing weal and woe with the people is not a trivial matter of lifestyle, but a major matter of consolidating the Party's ties with the masses. It should be said that Comrade Guo Mingchang's performance in this regard is very good. When he saw that the factory's working conditions and working environment were so bad, he felt that he had a responsibility to change it and a responsibility to improve the workers' working and living conditions. He not only led the workers to do the factory's cleaning and hygiene work, but also, in the spirit of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, used the old things as much as possible to install dust collectors in the workshops, install safety equipment on the machines, and set up canteens and bathrooms for the workers. During the days when Shanghai was hit by typhoons, he worked day and night, guarding the factory buildings with the workers, and helping workers whose homes were affected by the disaster to overcome their difficulties. It was precisely because Comrade Guo Mingchang cared for and loved the workers so much, regarding the workers' difficulties in production and life as his own difficulties, and tried his best to solve them whenever possible; it was precisely because he could share weal and woe with the masses that he won the support of the workers, promoted the workers' enthusiasm and creativity, and quickly changed the backward face of the Yongda Cotton Ginning Factory. Comrade Guo Mingchang's style of caring about the masses' lives, sharing weal and woe with the masses, and being diligent and thrifty is also extremely valuable in today's period of peaceful construction, and it is worthy of us learning from him; especially those who only care about improving their personal lives and do not care about the suffering of the masses, and do not cherish state property, should use Comrade Guo Mingchang's attitude towards the masses and enterprises as a mirror to examine themselves and quickly wash away the dirty things on their bodies.

    像郭明昌一样地为党工作
    林洪
    我们的事业已经有了巨大的成就，但是还有许多艰苦繁重的工作等待着我们去作；我们的生活和工作条件正在一天天地改善，但是还有许多人的生活并不富裕，还有许多人在困难的环境下工作。这就要求每个共产党员都必须保持和发扬艰苦朴素的优良传统，都必须保持和发扬和人民同甘共苦的优良作风。只有这样，才能影响和带动广大的人民群众，更有效地推进国家的建设事业。
    在我们党内有许多这样的同志，他们没有因为我们事业的胜利而不愿做艰苦的工作，没有因为自己成了负责的干部而忘记了人民。这中间有许多是老干部，也有不少是新干部。1月25日本报第四版以“披荆斩棘的人”为题介绍的公私合营永大弹花厂公方副厂长郭明昌，就是这许多共产党员中间的一个。这个同志在困难的条件下出色地完成了党分配给他的任务，把一个污秽不堪的工厂变成了整洁的工厂，把一个严重亏损的工厂变成了有盈余的工厂。从全国范围来说，一个只有三十八个工人和四部老旧轧花机的工厂办好了，这可能不是什么了不起的大事；但是郭明昌同志在工作中所表现出来的优良的品质和作风，则是值得我们所有共产党员和革命工作人员学习的。
    值得我们首先向郭明昌同志学习的，是他那种不怕困难、不怕吃苦的精神，这种精神在和平建设的时期尤为可贵。因为在和平建设的时期，人们很容易产生贪图安逸而不愿做艰苦工作的思想。例如最近一个时期，为了加强党对农村工作的领导，许多地方都从领导机关抽调了一批干部到农村基层组织中去工作，要他们在那里安家落户。这中间固然有许多人愉快地服从了组织上的分配；但是也有一些人以“不熟悉农村情况”等为理由，而不愿意到农村中去工作。实质上是他们害怕农村的艰苦生活，他们对革命事业的热情已经愈来愈淡薄了。但是郭明昌同志完全不是这样，党的组织和政府分配他去工作的地方，不仅是一个设备陈旧落后的工厂，而且几乎每个角落都堆放着脏东西，都布满了一股刺鼻的恶臭的工厂。这种景象，也曾经使郭明昌同志发生过动摇，然而对党的事业的关心和对工人的爱护，很快就使他坚定起来，愉快地走上了工作岗位。他所以愿意到别人可能不愿意到的地方工作，是因为他懂得那个工厂的环境虽然很肮脏，工作虽然很困难；但却是党必须占领的一块阵地，而他——一个为党所信任的共产党员，如果不去占领这个阵地，又有谁去占领呢？如果被蛆虫、苍蝇和恶臭吓退了，又算得什么共产党员呢？正是由于他具有共产党员应有的责任感和积极地为党工作的品德，他才能够卷起袖子，带上口罩，去为工人清除厨房里的剩饭剩菜；才能够和工人一起挖蛆虫、灭苍蝇；才能够爱厂如爱家，处处为工厂和为工人着想，而他的努力果然也就收到了良好的结果，不但工厂的环境卫生和工作条件很快就改善了，而且在他的优良作风的影响之下，工人的思想也转变了，工人的劳动生产率直线上升了！
    我们的力量的源泉来自人民，我们的事业的胜利主要是有人民的支持。但是如果我们不关心人民的生活，对人民的疾苦漠然置之，即使我们天天喊叫联系群众，群众也是不会和我们一条心的。因此保持和发扬党的关心人民生活、和人民同甘共苦的优良作风，并不是生活作风上的小事情，而是巩固党和群众的联系的大事情。应当说，郭明昌同志在这方面的表现是很好的。当他看见工厂的劳动条件和工作环境是那样恶劣的时候，他感到自己有责任改变它，有责任改善工人的劳动和生活条件。他不但带动工人作了工厂的清洁卫生工作，而且本着勤俭办企业的精神，尽可能利用旧有的东西，为车间装上了除尘器，为机器装上了安全设备，为工人设立了食堂和浴室。在台风袭击上海的日子里，他又白天黑夜地工作，和工人一起守护厂房，帮助家中受灾的工人度过了困难。正是由于郭明昌同志是这样地关心和爱护工人，把工人在生产和生活上的困难看作如同自己的困难一样，只要有可能就尽力加以解决；正是由于他能够和群众同甘共苦，他才得到了工人的拥护，才发扬了工人的积极性和创造性，迅速地改变了永大弹花厂的落后面貌。郭明昌同志的这种关心群众生活、和群众同甘共苦和勤俭朴实的作风，在今天和平建设的时期也是极为可贵的，值得我们向他学习；特别是那些只关心个人生活的改善而不管群众的疾苦，不爱护国家资财的人，更应当把郭明昌同志对待群众和企业的态度当作一面镜子来照照，赶快洗掉自己身上的肮脏东西。
