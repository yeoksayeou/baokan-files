Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, 8th. The Fengman Hydropower Station eliminated all kinds of equipment accidents and casualties among production personnel last year, and safely supplied a large amount of cheap electricity to Northeast China. The power generated by this power station last year, exceeding the plan, was enough for Angang (Anshan Iron and Steel) to use for more than a month.

The rebuilt Fengman Hydropower Station has installed many new types of equipment. All employees of the power station worked hard last year to learn and master the technology of these new equipment. Leading cadres and operation and maintenance personnel all adhered to regular technical studies based on their professional divisions of labor. They also absorbed the advanced management experience of power plants and substations in Xiashuisi, Liaoyuan, and Harbin. These studies helped every production person to understand the possible accidents of the equipment they mastered and the methods of prevention.

    丰满电站安全生产一年
    据新华社吉林8日电　丰满水电站去年消灭了各种设备事故和生产人员伤亡事故，安全地供应了东北地区大量廉价电力。这座电站在去年比计划多发的电，足够鞍钢用一个多月。
    经过改建的丰满水电站，安装了许多新型设备。电站的全体职工去年努力学习掌握这些新设备的技术。领导干部和运行维护人员都根据专业分工坚持定期的技术学习。他们还吸取了下摄司、辽源和哈尔滨等地电厂和变电所的先进管理经验。这些学习帮助每个生产人员了解到自己所掌握的设备可能发生的事故和预防的方法。
