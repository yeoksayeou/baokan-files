    Great Harvest of Grain, Cotton, and Oil Crops in Xiaogan County, Hubei
    1956 Compared to 1955: Grain Production Increased by 42.23%, Cotton Production Increased by 122.5%, Peanut Production Increased by 68%, Sesame Production Increased by 29.2%
    (Our Newspaper) According to reports, Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, has achieved great success in agricultural production. In 1956, the total grain output of the county reached 746,225,700 jin, with an average yield of 817 jin per mu, an increase of 42.23% compared with 1955 (an increase of more than 220 million jin). This is the county with the highest grain production increase rate in the province. The county has 379,133 mu of high-yield fields producing over 1,000 jin of grain, accounting for 46.92% of the total grain field area, of which 6,396 mu produced over 1,500 jin per mu, and 684 mu produced over 1,800 jin per mu. The county has five "1,000-jin districts," twenty-two "1,000-jin townships," and five hundred and sixty-one "1,000-jin cooperatives." The total output of ginned cotton in the county was 3,688,100 jin, with an average yield of 44.5 jin per mu, an increase of 122.5% compared with 1955. The average yield of peanuts in the county was 410 jin per mu, an increase of 68% compared with 1955, and the average yield of sesame was 115 jin per mu, an increase of 29.2% compared with 1955.
    The bumper harvest in agricultural production has ensured increased production in 99.64% of the cooperatives and increased income for 97.5% of the members in the county. The average actual income per household for the county's 168,000+ farm households is 367 yuan, of which the average food grain income is more than 730 jin per person.
    After the realization of agricultural cooperation in 1956, the Xiaogan County Committee of the Communist Party of China led the agricultural cooperatives to boldly implement the reform of the farming system in accordance with local conditions. The county expanded the multiple cropping area by 200,4913 mu, and converted 41,527 mu of dry land into paddy fields, increasing grain production by 67,292,328 jin, accounting for 30.3% of the county's total increase in production. Improved local seed varieties were planted on 255,234 mu, increasing grain production by 23,929,383 jin, accounting for 10.8% of the county's total increase in production. Due to the large-scale construction of water conservancy projects, the irrigated area was expanded by 172,738 mu, and the improved irrigated area was 80,605 mu, greatly reducing water and drought disasters. Great efforts have also been made in accumulating fertilizer. The county not only eliminated the phenomenon of planting "white fields" (in 1955, "white fields" accounted for 20%-30% of the total cultivated land area), but also the amount of fertilizer applied per unit area generally increased by 30%-50% compared to the past. In addition, the large-scale four rectification campaigns of cooperatives, the continuous development of advanced producer movements and participation in competitions, the promotion of new technologies, vigorous prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, and strengthening the leadership of grassroots organizations have all played a significant role in ensuring increased production this year.

    湖北孝感县粮食棉花油料大丰收
    1956年同1955年相比：粮食增产42.23％，棉花增产122.5％，花生增产68％，芝麻增产29.2％
    本报讯　湖北省孝感县在农业生产上取得了巨大成绩。1956年，这个县粮食总产量达到七亿四千六百二十二万五千七百斤，每亩平均产量是八百一十七斤，比1955年增产42.23％（即增产二亿二千余万斤）。这是全省粮食增产率最高的一个县。全县出现粮食千斤丰产田三十七万九千一百三十三亩，占粮田总面积的46.92％，其中亩产一千五百斤以上的有六千三百九十六亩，亩产一千八百斤以上的有六百八十四亩。全县出现了五个千斤区、二十二个千斤乡，五百六十一个千斤社。全县皮棉产量三百六十八万八千一百斤，平均亩产四十四斤半，比1955年增产122.5％。全县花生平均亩产四百一十斤，比1955年增产68％，芝麻平均亩产一百一十五斤，比1955年增产29.2％。
    由于农业生产获得丰收，保证了全县99.64％的合作社增产和97.5％的社员增加收入。全县十六万八千余万农户，平均每户实际收入三百六十七元，其中口粮收入平均每人七百三十多斤。
    1956年实现农业合作化后，中共孝感县委领导农业社大胆地因地制宜地实行耕作制度的改革。全县扩大复种面积二十万零四千九百一十三亩，旱地改水田四万一千五百二十七亩，共增产粮食六千七百二十九万二千三百二十八斤，占全县总增产量30.3％。土种改良种二十五万五千二百三十四亩，增产粮食二千三百九十二万九千三百八十三斤，占全县总增产量10.8％。由于大规模地兴修水利，扩大灌溉面积十七万二千七百三十八亩，改善灌溉面积八万零六百零五亩，大大地减少了水、旱灾害。在积肥方面也作了很大努力。全县不仅消灭了种白田现象（1955年白田占农田总面积的20％—30％）而且单位面积施肥量一般较过去增加了30％—50％。此外，大规模的四次整社工作、不断开展先进生产者运动和参加评比、推广新技术、大力防治病虫害和加强对基层组织的领导等，对于保证今年增产都起了很大作用。
