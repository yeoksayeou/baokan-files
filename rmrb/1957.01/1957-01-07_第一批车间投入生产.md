    Construction Dynamics
    Xinhua News Agency: The first group of workshops of the Chengdu Cutting Tool Factory, which began construction in May 1956, were put into production on December 29th and 30th respectively.

    The workshops put into production include three workshops for tool manufacturing, machine repair, and motor repair. The tool manufacturing workshop will now produce various specifications of fixtures and tools for its own use, in order to prepare tools for the factory's formal production in 1957.

    The metrology workshop and the cutting tool workshop are currently installing machinery and equipment; three warehouses with different properties such as fire prevention and moisture prevention have been basically completed.

    This modern factory, which mostly uses Chinese-made machinery and equipment, is expected to be fully put into production in the second half of 1957. Its metrology instruments and cutting tools will be supplied in large quantities to the mechanical industries in Southwest and Northwest China for the manufacture of various precision machinery and equipment. Its production capacity is 30% larger than that of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant.

    第一批车间投入生产
    新华社讯　1956年5月动工兴建的成都刃具厂，第一批完工的车间，先后在12月29日和30日投入生产。
    投入生产的包括工具制造、机器修理和电机修理三个车间。工具制造车间从现在开始，就生产本厂自用的各种规格的卡具和工具，为这个厂1957年正式生产作好工具准备。
    目前正在安装机器设备的有量具厂房和刃具厂房；三座具有防火、防潮等不同性能的仓库已经基本完工。
    这个绝大部分采用中国自己制造的机器设备的现代化工厂，预计在1957年下半年全部投入生产。它出产的量具和刃具，将大量供应中国西南和西北地区的机械工业，用来制造各种精密的机器设备。它的生产能力比哈尔滨量具刃具厂大30％。
