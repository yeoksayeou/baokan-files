    "Raise Your Head and See Happiness"
    In the past, during the Spring Festival in rural areas, people liked to paste a red paper strip with the words "Raise Your Head and See Happiness" above the door of their houses. Such red paper strips can still be pasted now; however, we must interpret it with new meaning.
    The Shangrao Special District of Jiangxi Province is going to widely publicize the superiority of agricultural cooperatives starting from the Spring Festival, improve the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and people, and prepare for an even greater harvest. This is to have everyone "Raise Your Head and See Happiness."
    Some people only lower their heads to look at the few inches of ground under their feet, and then feel that the road they have traveled this year is full of bumps and hollows. They become pessimistic, even sad for having worn out their shoe tips, and lose the courage to continue moving forward. This becomes "Lower Your Head and See Sorrow."
    Raise your heads! Look at the gratifying achievements that have emerged just after the realization of cooperation. And look forward, just as the Laiyang Prefectural Committee of Shandong Province has done, and see how many greater achievements we will obtain.
    Of course, "raising your head" is by no means looking at the sky with no one in sight. In that case, you can only stumble, and you still won't see "happiness."

### “抬头见喜”

    “抬头见喜”
    过去农村里过春节的时候，人们喜欢在屋门上方贴一个写着“抬头见喜”的红纸条。这样的红纸条现在还是可以贴的；不过，我们要用新的意义解释它。
    江西上饶专区将要从春节开始广泛宣传农业社的优越性，提高广大干部和群众的积极性，为更大的丰收做好准备工作。这就是要大家“抬头见喜”。
    有些人只是低下头来看自己脚尖下的几寸地，就觉得这一年走的道路全是坑坑凹凹的，悲观起来，甚至为磨破了自己的鞋头而伤心起来，丧失了继续前进的勇气。这就成了“低头见悲”。
    抬起头来吧！看看刚刚实现了合作化就出现了多少可喜的成绩。再向前望一望吧，正像山东莱阳地委所作的那样，看看我们将要得到多少更大的成绩。
    当然，“抬头”决不是目中无人地只望着天空。那样，只可能跌交，同样是见不到“喜”的。
