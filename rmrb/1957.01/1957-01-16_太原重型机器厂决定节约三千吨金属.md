Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 15th: The Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant is seeking ways to save metal from production management and technical management, and has formulated a plan to save 3,000 tons of metal throughout the year.

The Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant started work on saving metal in November last year. When they began checking for waste loopholes, they found that the biggest waste of metal was caused by poor production and technical management. Therefore, the plant mobilized all engineering and technical personnel and production management personnel to find ways to save. In the past two months, production and technical management personnel have proposed ninety-one measures to save metal materials from improving product design, improving process procedures, revising raw material consumption quotas, and improving production management.

When the designers deeply checked for waste and looked for ways to save, they reviewed the designs of thirteen major products of the plant and found that there were unreasonable aspects in many product designs. Based on the principle of ensuring product quality, the designers put forward sixty-three saving measures from improving product design structure, reducing machining allowances, and reducing product weight. According to the preliminary output plan proposed this year, these measures can save the country at least 316 tons of steel. After modifying the design of the 50-ton bridge crane, each unit can use more than 4,200 kilograms less steel.

Process engineering and technical personnel mainly sought ways to save from reducing raw material consumption and improving processing technology. The six saving measures they proposed can save more than 30 tons of steel this year. Engineering and technical personnel in forging and metallurgy also put forward twenty-one saving measures from improving forging and heat treatment and smelting and casting processes. Their saving measures have been proven effective through experiments and can save 780 tons of steel throughout the year.

Because this factory started from technical management and production management to find ways to save in many aspects, the difficulty of insufficient metal in some production processes throughout the plant this year may be solved.

    太原重型机器厂决定节约三千吨金属
    新华社太原15日电　太原重型机器厂从生产管理和技术管理中寻找节约门路，制定出全年节约三千吨金属的计划。
    太原重型机器厂从去年11月起开展节约金属工作。在开始检查浪费漏洞的时候，发现金属方面最大的浪费是因为生产和技术管理不善造成的。于是厂里发动全体工程技术人员和生产管理人员寻找节约门路。两个多月来，生产和技术管理人员从改进产品设计、改进工艺规程、修改原材料消耗定额和改善生产管理方面，提出了九十一项节约金属材料的措施。
    设计人员们在深入检查浪费、寻找节约门路的时候，复查了全厂十三种主要产品的设计，发现许多产品设计中有不合理的地方。设计人员们本着保证产品质量的原则，从改进产品设计结构、减少加工余量、减轻产品重量等方面，提出了六十三项节约措施。根据今年初步提出的产量计划计算，这些措施至少能给国家节约三百一十六吨钢材。五十吨桥式起重机经过修改设计以后，每台可以少用四千二百多公斤钢材。
    工艺工程技术人员们主要从降低原材料消耗，改善加工工艺方面寻找节约门路。他们提出的六项节约措施，今年可以节约三十多吨钢材。锻冶方面的工程技术人员也从改进锻压热处理、冶炼铸造工艺方面提出了二十一项节约措施。他们的节约措施经过试验都很有效，全年可以节约钢材七百八十吨。
    这个工厂由于从技术管理和生产管理上着手多方面寻找节约门路，全厂今年生产中部分金属不足的困难已经有可能得到解决。
