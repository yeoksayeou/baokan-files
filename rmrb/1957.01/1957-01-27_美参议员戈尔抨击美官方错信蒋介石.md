Xinhua News Agency, January 26th, Washington dispatch: American newspapers report that Democratic Senator Gore, who recently returned from a trip to the Far East, said recently that he is convinced that the Eisenhower administration's policy toward Asia is impractical.

He compared the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to a "paper cup with an American label," and said that the United States is tied to the sinking ship of Taiwan.

Gore said, "In the Far East, except for Taiwan, he could not find anyone who would believe that Chiang Kai-shek's plan to occupy mainland China could be realized, rather than being a pipe dream." "However, some American officials in Taiwan harbor mythical dreams that this is possible. Some senior American representatives here always refer to the Kuomintang as 'us' when they talk about them; their relationship with Chiang Kai-shek is so inseparable."

Gore said he did not know how long the United States could maintain this myth that Chiang Kai-shek could represent mainland China.

He also expressed opposition to recognizing the new China and advocated Taiwan's "independence."

    美参议员戈尔抨击美官方错信蒋介石
    新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：美国报刊报道，不久以前从远东旅行回国的民主党参议员戈尔最近说，他确信艾森豪威尔政府对亚洲的政策是不切实际的。
    他把东南亚条约组织比作一只“贴上美国标签的纸杯”，他说，美国被拴在台湾那艘正在沉没的船只上。
    戈尔说，“在远东，除了台湾以外，他找不到一个人会相信蒋介石占领中国大陆的计划能够实现，而不是空想。”“可是台湾一些美国官方人士却怀着神话般的梦想，认为这是可能发生的。这地方有些美国高级代表在谈到国民党人时，总是称为‘我们’，他们同蒋介石的关系就是这样的不可分割。”
    戈尔说，他不知道美国对这种蒋介石可以代表大陆中国的神话还可以维持多久。
  他同时又表示反对承认新中国，并且主张台湾“独立”。
