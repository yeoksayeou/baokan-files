Xinhua News Agency, January 20th dispatch from Tel Aviv: Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion said in Tel Aviv on the evening of the 18th that Israel would not accept any resolutions passed by the United Nations that "violate Israel's interests."

He stated that Israel would never agree to retreat behind the 1949 armistice line that existed before its aggression against Egypt unless Israel received "full guarantees." He did not further explain what constituted "full guarantees." He said: Israel is facing a political struggle to protect the interests it gained in the military offensive last November.

Ben-Gurion's above remarks were broadcast in a recorded speech by Israeli Radio on the evening of the 19th, after announcing that the United Nations General Assembly had passed the proposal of the twenty-five Asian and African countries.

    以总理狂叫不接受联合国决议
    据新华社20日讯　特拉维夫消息：以色列总理本—古里安18日晚上在特拉维夫说，以色列不会接受联合国通过的任何“违反以色列利益”的决议。
    他表示，以色列决不同意退回到它侵略埃及以前的1949年停战线后面，除非以色列得到“充分的保证”。他没有对“充分的保证”作进一步的解释。他说：以色列正面临着一场政治斗争，以保护它在去年11月的军事进攻中得到的利益。
    本—古里安的上述谈话，是以色列广播电台19日晚上在宣布了联合国大会已经通过亚非二十五国的提案之后用录音演说发表的。
