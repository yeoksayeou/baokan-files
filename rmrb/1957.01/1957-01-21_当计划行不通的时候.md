When the Plan Doesn't Work

    The winter water conservancy work of the Huafeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zunyi County, Guizhou Province, did not go smoothly at first. The project was determined, but the members were slow to start work. To address this, the members of the Management Committee sought opinions from the members. Several production teams unanimously believed that the Management Committee's plan was not practical. The plan called for the construction of four large-scale water conservancy projects, requiring 150,000 workdays. The members said: these projects are too large, the benefits are slow to materialize, and they are beyond our capabilities, so we are unwilling to start work. Some members also reflected: when water conservancy was built last spring, a "random mobilization" approach was adopted, resulting in a lot of wasted work and poor project quality. Some weirs, after being built, could not be used. In the calculation of labor compensation, there was no distinction between strong and weak labor, high and low skills, or between stonework and earthwork; everything was rigidly divided and recorded, which was also very unreasonable.
    The Management Committee adopted the members' opinions and, after careful study, revised the plan, deciding to only repair three weirs that require less labor and bring greater benefits this year, and to repair a few more weirs. These projects were contracted to several production teams, and the teams organized construction teams, with special personnel leading the construction. For labor compensation, reasonable regulations were also made according to the specific conditions such as the distance of soil removal and the difficulty of digging. The work points for the day were evaluated and recorded on the same day. To ensure quality, quality standards and inspection and acceptance systems were also established. After these measures were taken, the members immediately went to work enthusiastically, and labor efficiency continued to improve. Now, three projects have been basically completed.
    When a plan doesn't work, the first thing the leadership should do is not to complain that the masses are backward, but to investigate the actual situation, listen to the opinions of the masses, revise the plan, and fill in the loopholes. Correct plans and reasonable measures that come from the masses will inevitably arouse the great labor enthusiasm of the masses.

    当计划行不通的时候
    贵州省遵义县华丰农业生产合作社的冬修水利工作，最初不大顺利，工程确定了，但是社员们却迟迟不动工。为了这件事，管理委员会的委员去向社员们征求意见。几个生产队一致认为：管委会的计划不切合实际。计划兴修的四个大型水利工程，要用十五万个工。社员们说：这些工程太大，收效慢、力不能及，所以不愿意动工。还有些社员反映：去年春天兴修水利的时候，采取了“乱点兵”的办法，窝工很多，工程质量也不高，有的堰修完了不能用。在劳动报酬的计算上，不分劳力强弱、技术高低，也不分石工土工，一律死分死记，也很不合理。
    管委会采纳了社员们的意见，经过认真的研究，修订了计划，决定今年只修费工少、受益大的三口堰，再补修几口堰。这些工程包给几个生产队去做，队里又组织施工小组，由专人领导施工。对于劳动报酬，也按照取土远近、挖工难易等具体条件，作了合理的规定。当天的工分，当天评，当天记。为了保证质量，还订出了质量标准和检查、验收制度。采取这些措施以后，社员们立即踊跃出工，劳动效率不断提高，现在有三处工程已经基本完成。
    当一个计划行不通的时候，领导方面首先应该做的事情不是去埋怨群众落后，而是调查实际情况，听取群众的意见，来修订计划，填补疏漏。从群众中来的正确的计划和合理的措施，必然会唤起群众的极大的劳动积极性。
