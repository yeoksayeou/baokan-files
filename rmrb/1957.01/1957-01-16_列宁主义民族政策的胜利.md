"The Victory of the Leninist National Policy"
    The "Pravda" editorial pointed out that the Central Asian republics have become prosperous industrial and agricultural republics, and they have a moving prospect of developing socialist economy and culture. The great friendship of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union is growing and consolidating.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 15th, via TASS: "Pravda" published an editorial on the 14th entitled "The Victory of the Leninist National Policy."
    The editorial first pointed out that as the Soviet Union enters its fortieth year, all nationalities and tribes in the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have achieved brilliant successes in economic and cultural construction due to the consistent implementation of the Leninist national policy. The Leninist national policy means that socialism not only does not eliminate national differences and characteristics, but on the contrary, socialism ensures that the economy and culture of all nationalities and tribes can be fully developed and prospered.
    The editorial then made a sharp contrast between the situation of the Central Asian nations before the revolution and in the Soviet era. The editorial said that before the revolution, Central Asia was a backward frontier of Tsarist Russia, where there was no industry, science, or culture of its own. The Tsar implemented a colonialist policy towards the eastern nations, causing them to fall into bankruptcy and death. In the era of the Soviet regime, Uzbekistan established a strong modern industry. The agriculture of the republic has undergone fundamental changes. Before the revolution, the highest harvest of Uzbekistan's main agricultural product, cotton, was 518,000 tons. Last year, the republic provided 2.86 million tons to the purchasing stations. This is equal to the total cotton production of cotton-growing countries such as Brazil, Pakistan, Turkey, and Iran.
    The Central Asian republics of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan, like Uzbekistan, have become prosperous industrial and agricultural republics in the Soviet East. They have all been awarded the Order of Lenin for their great achievements in agriculture and animal husbandry.
    The editorial pointed out that all the Soviet republics have achieved tremendous achievements in developing culture with national forms and socialist content. Before the revolution, only 2% of the local residents of Uzbekistan had received education. Now, a seven-year universal education system has been implemented here, and an Academy of Sciences has been established, with thirty-four universities, in which more than 65,000 students are studying. In the development of higher education, Uzbekistan far exceeds some countries in the East and Western Europe.
    The editorial concluded by saying that the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan has opened up moving prospects for all nationalities to develop their socialist economy and culture. Under the banner of proletarian internationalism, the great friendship of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union is growing and consolidating.

    “列宁主义民族政策的胜利”
    苏联“真理报”的社论指出：中亚细亚各加盟共和国已成为繁荣的工农共和国，它们面前出现了发展社会主义经济和文化的动人远景，苏联各族人民的伟大友谊正在成长和巩固。
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”14日发表了题为“列宁主义民族政策的胜利”的社论。
    社论首先指出，在苏联进入第四十个年头的时候，苏联各民族和各部族在共产党的领导下，由于一贯执行列宁主义民族政策，在经济和文化建设方面获得了辉煌成就。列宁主义民族政策意味着，社会主义不仅不消除民族差异和特点，相反地，社会主义保证各民族和各部族的经济和文化能够得到全面发展和繁荣。
    社论接着以革命前和苏维埃年代的中亚细亚各民族的情况作了鲜明的对比，社论说，在革命前的中亚细亚是沙皇俄国的落后边疆，那里没有自己的工业、科学和文化。沙皇对东方各民族实行殖民主义政策，使他们陷于破产和死亡的境地。在苏维埃政权的年代里，乌兹别克建立了强大的现代化工业。共和国的农业发生了根本的变化。在革命前，乌兹别克主要农产品——棉花的最高收获量是五十一万八千吨。而在去年，共和国给采购站的就有二百八十六万吨。这等于巴西、巴基斯坦、土耳其和伊朗这样一些植棉国棉花产量的总和。
    中亚细亚各加盟共和国——塔吉克、土库曼和吉尔吉斯也像乌兹别克一样，成为苏联东方的繁荣的工农业共和国。它们由于在农业和牲畜饲养业方面的巨大成就，都获得列宁勋章。
    社论指出，苏联所有的加盟共和国在发展民族形式、社会主义内容的文化方面得到了巨大的成就。革命以前，乌兹别克的本地居民只有2％受过教育。现在这里实行了七年制普及教育，建立了科学院，有三十四所高等学校，在这些高等学校中学习的学生达六万五千多人。在发展高等教育方面，乌兹别克远远超过了东方和西欧的一些国家。
    社论最后说，苏联第六个五年计划在各族人民面前打开了他们的发展社会主义经济和文化的动人远景。在无产阶级国际主义旗帜下，苏联各族人民的伟大友谊正在成长和巩固。
