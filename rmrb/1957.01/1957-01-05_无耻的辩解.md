	Shameless Justification
	After releasing a trial balloon, the advocates of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" apparently realized that the wind was not right, because before the goods were even released, they were being scolded everywhere. They hurriedly tried to cover up the aggressive essence of this "doctrine" that was hostile to the people of the Middle East. Washington officials grandly declared that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" was "prompted by the appeal of the Arabs," and that the U.S. State Department had received "a great many" requests from Arab countries asking the United States to "assume greater responsibility in the Middle East." They also said that this was because "the United States is very popular in Arab countries."
	In other words, the United States is preparing to expand its aggressive forces into the Middle East simply because it feels it "cannot refuse the kindness" and is merely fulfilling its due "responsibility."
	However, how can the chorus of condemnation of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" emanating from the Middle East be reconciled with the enviable situation described by Washington officials?
	As early as the spring of 1953, when Dulles visited Egypt, an Egyptian Senator, Fathia, wrote in an open letter to the Secretary of State: "All Arab peoples hate you and do not believe you... This hatred and distrust arise because our illusions about you and the principles you have defended in the two world wars have been painfully shattered." It is hard not to think that these words accurately express the feelings of the Arab people towards American colonialists.
	The problem is that the American masters have always been unwilling to open their eyes and face reality. There are many such examples. The United States has insisted that Asian countries need the "protection" of the Southeast Asia Treaty, but many Asian countries have declared that they do not want American "protection."
	The justifications of Washington officials prove that their situation is getting worse and worse. They can use all kinds of tricks to gloss over things, but the new brand of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is by no means more resonant than any previous American aggression. Washington's helplessness lies in the fact that the Arab people, and all anti-colonialist forces, have become more experienced than ever before, and their ability to see through all kinds of aggressive tricks is stronger. This shameful justification by Washington officials can only make people laugh.

### 无耻的辩解

    无耻的辩解
    “艾森豪威尔主义”的鼓吹者们在放出了试探气球之后，显然已经察觉到风色不对，因为货色尚未出炉，就已到处挨骂。他们赶忙设法掩饰这种“主义”敌视中东人民的侵略实质。华盛顿的官员冠冕堂皇地声明：“艾森豪威尔主义”是“由于阿拉伯的吁请而促成的”，美国国务院收到了阿拉伯国家“非常多的”要求，要求美国“在中东承担更大的责任”。他们还说，这是因为“美国在阿拉伯国家中很得人心”。
    这就是说，美国准备向中东扩张侵略势力原来是由于感到“盛情难却”，不过负起应负的“责任”罢了。
    但是，从中东响起的对“艾森豪威尔主义”一片责难声，又怎能同华盛顿官员所说的那样令人羡慕的情况协调起来呢？
    早在1953年春天杜勒斯访问埃及的时候，埃及一位参议员法特哈就曾经在他给这位国务卿的一封公开信中写道：“所有阿拉伯人民都憎恨你们，都不相信你们……这种憎恨和不信任之所以产生，是因为我们对你们以及对你们在两次世界大战当中所维护的原则所抱的幻想，已经痛苦地破灭了。”人们很难不认为这番话确切地表达了阿拉伯人民对美国殖民主义者的感情。
    问题在于美国老爷们始终不愿张开眼睛正视现实。这样的例子是很不少的。美国曾硬说亚洲国家需要东南亚条约的“保护”，但是许多亚洲国家却宣布并不要美国的“保护”。
    华盛顿官员们的辩白，证明他们的景况越来越不妙了。他们可以用各种各样的手法来粉饰，但是，“艾森豪威尔主义”这个新牌子决不比美国过去任何一种侵略的牌子响亮些。华盛顿无可奈何的是，阿拉伯人民，一切反殖民主义的力量，都变得比过去任何时候更有经验了，他们识破形形色色的侵略诡计的能力更强了。华盛顿官员的这种可耻辩解只能使人发笑。
