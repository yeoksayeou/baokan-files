Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 8th: The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni each released five hundred Chinese fish into Rewalsar Lake in Himachal Pradesh on January 6th. According to Buddhist tradition, this is called "releasing life."

Rewalsar Lake, twelve miles from Mandi, is surrounded by mountains and is four thousand feet above sea level. Tibetans call it "Tso Pema," meaning "Lotus Sea." The famous Indian monk Padmasambhava, who first spread Buddhism to Tibet in the eighth century AD, preached here.

Villagers welcomed the guests in a beautiful tent at the foot of the mountain. The chairman of the Rewalsar Township Committee recited a poem and gave a welcome speech.

On the morning of the 6th, the Dalai Lama, accompanied by the Deputy Governor of Himachal Pradesh, Singh, drove around the shore of the lake. He released five hundred Chinese fish, four ducks, and four geese into the lake, and planted a magnolia tree in front of the Guru Rinpoche Temple. Then he began to preach. Thousands of people sat on the grass and hillsides to listen to him. He also threw many fruits and other sacred objects brought from Tibet into the lake.

The Panchen, accompanied by the former King of Mandi, Joginder Sen, arrived in Rewalsar on the afternoon of the 6th. He spoke to the public under a tent. Then, he threw fish, ducks, and geese into the lake and took a boat to a floating island in the center of the lake. There, he planted Buddhist flags. The Panchen threw sacred objects into the lake, planted a tree, and then received devotees in front of the temple. He prayed in the temple for a long time.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 8th: The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni and their entourage returned to New Delhi from Mandi this morning.

The Deputy Governor of Himachal Pradesh, Bajrang Bahadur Singh, the Maharaja of Mandi, Joginder Sen, and other senior officials saw the distinguished guests off at the end of the street. Thousands of people stood by the roadside and on the rooftops waving goodbye to them.

After resting in New Delhi for a few days, the Dalai Lama and Panchen will visit the Buddhist holy site of Nalanda.

    达赖喇嘛班禅额尔德尼访问喜马偕尔邦
    据新华社新德里8日电　达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼1月6日每人向喜马偕尔邦的腊瓦萨尔圣湖投了五百条中国鱼。根据佛教传统，这叫做放生。
    离曼地十二英里的腊瓦萨尔湖为群山环抱，海拔四千英尺。我国西藏人称它为“曹比马”，意思是“莲海”。第一位在公元八世纪到西藏传布佛教的著名的印度僧人莲花生上师曾在这里讲过道。
    村民们在山下的美丽的帐篷里欢迎客人。腊瓦萨尔乡委员会主席朗诵了诗篇并且致欢迎词。
    6日上午，达赖在喜马偕尔邦副邦长辛格的陪同下乘车环游湖岸。他把五百条中国鱼、四只鸭子和四只鹅在湖里放了生，在古鲁·阳德马萨姆巴伐庙前种了一株木莲树。然后，他开始讲道。数以千计的人坐在草地上和山坡上听他讲道。他还向湖里投了许多从西藏带来的果子和其他圣物。
    班禅在前曼地王公焦京德尔·森的陪同下，在6日下午到达腊瓦萨尔。他在帐篷下向公众讲话。然后，他向湖里投下了鱼、鸭、鹅，并且坐船到湖中心的一个浮岛上。在那里，他插上了佛教旗帜。班禅向湖里投了圣物，种了树，然后在寺前接见了信徒。他在寺内祈祷了很久。
    据新华社新德里8日电　达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼一行今天上午从曼地回到新德里。
    喜马偕尔邦副邦长巴季兰·巴哈杜尔·辛格、曼地的大君乔金德·森和其他高级官员们在街道的尽头欢送贵宾。几千人站在路旁和屋顶上挥手向他们告别。
    达赖和班禅在新德里休息几天后，就去参观佛教圣地那烂陀。
