Xinhua News Agency, January 4th, TASS, New York, January 4th: The representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front, Mohammed Yazid, submitted a memorandum to the Chairman of the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on January 3rd.

The memorandum describes the negotiations between the Algerian National Liberation Front and representatives of the French government. In these negotiations, the Algerian representatives requested France to recognize Algeria's right to independence and to establish a provisional government in order to strive for a swift ceasefire and begin negotiations to determine the relationship between France and Algeria. The memorandum states that, however, the position of the French side showed that the French government was far from willing to recognize the sovereignty of the Algerian people and their right to autonomy. All attempts by the Algerian people to seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict with France have been unsuccessful, and the French government should be held responsible for this.

The memorandum points out that the arrest of several members of the Algerian National Liberation Front delegation on October 22, 1956, by the French authorities as they were on their way to attend the Tunis Peace Conference naturally led to the breakdown of negotiations between France and Algeria.

The memorandum points out that now it is necessary for the United Nations to intervene. For nearly two years, too much Algerian and French blood has been shed. The war is still going on in Algeria. Member states of the United Nations can no longer ignore this war.

The memorandum concludes by stating that the National Liberation Front declares its readiness to begin negotiations with the French government, but, under the current circumstances, for such negotiations to be successful, guarantees and supervision from the United Nations are necessary.

    争取停火和开始谈判
    联合国应干预阿尔及利亚局势
    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线向联合国提出备忘录
    新华社4日讯　塔斯社纽约4日讯：阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线代表穆罕默德·雅齐德1月3日向联合国大会政治委员会主席提出了一份备忘录。
    备忘录叙述了阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线同法国政府代表谈判的经过，在这个谈判中，阿尔及利亚的代表曾经要求法国承认阿尔及利亚有独立和建立临时政府的权利，以便争取迅速停火和开始谈判，以确定法国和阿尔及利亚之间的关系。备忘录说，然而，法国方面的立场表明，法国政府远不愿承认阿尔及利亚人民的主权和他们的自治权利，阿尔及利亚人民争取和平解决同法国的冲突的一切尝试都没有成功，这应当由法国政府负责。
    备忘录指出，法国当局在1956年10月22日逮捕了前往参加突尼斯和平会议的阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线代表团的几名团员，这自然导致了法国和阿尔及利亚谈判的破裂。
    备忘录指出，现在联合国有必要出面干预。近两年来，阿尔及利亚人和法国人的血流得太多了。战争还在阿尔及利亚进行着。联合国会员国再也不能忽视这场战争了。
    备忘录最后说，民族解放阵线宣布准备同法国政府开始谈判，但是，在目前情况下，要想这种谈判成功，必须要有联合国方面的保证和监督。
