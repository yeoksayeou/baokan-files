Xinhua News Agency report: After sulfur handicraft production cooperatives in Shanxi Province universally implemented Soviet expert Andronov's suggestions on sulfur extraction technology in 1956, the average sulfur extraction rate per 100 jin of ore reached 16.5 jin, an increase of 1.75 times compared to 1955. As a result, the total sulfur production in the province increased twofold, and the sulfur content also increased from 99.5% to over 99.9%. Due to the increase in sulfur production, Shanxi Province handicraft cooperatives have twice lowered the production price of sulfur, accumulating more than 1.8 million yuan for the state throughout the year.

Shanxi Province is rich in pyrite deposits, and sulfur mining has a long history. The province currently has 72 sulfur handicraft production cooperatives. In the past, due to backward sulfur refining technology, narrow furnace bodies, and insufficient temperature, the sulfur yield was very low. In November 1954, Soviet expert Andronov proposed increasing the size of the sulfur refining furnace, expanding the capacity of the cooling chamber, and implementing layered ore loading. This suggestion was first successfully tested in a key cooperative in Yangcheng County. At the provincial sulfur production professional conference held in November 1955, the successful experience was introduced. By the end of 1956, more than 4,400 sulfur refining furnaces in the province had been improved and expanded according to the Soviet expert's suggestion, generally expanding from being able to hold 100-200 jin of ore to being able to hold 700-800 jin, and some expanding to over 3,000 jin. More than 3,800 cooling chambers have also been expanded. While promoting Soviet expert advice, various localities have also combined it with their original experience, further increasing the sulfur extraction rate.

    推行苏联专家建议提高硫磺产量
    据新华社讯　山西省的硫磺手工业生产合作社，1956年普遍推行苏联专家安德罗诺夫关于提炼硫磺技术的建议以后，每百斤矿石的提磺量平均达到十六点五斤，比1955年提高了一点七五倍。全省硫磺总产量因此增加两倍，硫磺的含硫量也由99.5％提高到99.9％以上。由于硫磺的产量提高，山西省手工业合作社曾经两次降低硫磺的生产价格，全年共为国家积累资金一百八十多万元。
    山西省硫化铁矿蕴藏丰富，硫矿生产有较长的历史。全省现有硫磺手工业生产合作社七十二个。过去由于炼磺技术落后、炉身窄小和温度不足等原因，出硫量很低。1954年11月，苏联专家安德罗诺夫提出了加大炼磺炉，扩大冷却室容量和实行分层装矿的建议。这个建议首先在阳城县的重点社试验成功。在1955年11月召开的全省硫磺生产专业会议上，又把试验成功的经验作了介绍。到1956年年底，全省已经有四千四百多个炼磺炉都根据苏联专家建议作了改进和扩大，一般都由过去能容一、二百斤矿石扩大到能容七、八百斤，有的扩大到三千斤以上。有三千八百多个冷却室也进行了扩建。各地在推行苏联专家建议的同时，又结合采用了当地原有的经验。使提磺率更加提高。
