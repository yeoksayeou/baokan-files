    Volunteering to Go to the Frontier!
    Xiao Dongchen, a film projectionist at the Jinzhou Finance and Accounting Technical School, had complaints about his work and life: First, he felt he had too little work. In two years, he was only allowed to show forty-one films, which is equivalent to half a month's work for a projectionist in a cinema, or two months' work for a rural film team. Employing a projectionist to show only twenty-odd films a year is simply a waste. Second, he is a young man, and he doesn't want to live in a Western-style building that is sheltered from the wind and rain, with screens in summer and heating in winter. He wants to go to the most difficult places in the motherland to temper himself. Based on these two points, he requested to work in the southern border region, but the leadership emphasized "work needs" and did not agree.
    He wrote to this newspaper twice, hoping to support his request.
    In addition to hoping that the leading comrades of this unit can reconsider his reasonable request, we also hope that those who are unwilling to go to the countryside can compare themselves with Xiao Dongchen.

    志愿到边疆去！
    锦州财务会计专业技术学校电影放映员肖东臣对工作和生活都有意见：一、他认为自己工作太少，两年来只让他放映了四十一场电影，这等于电影院中放映员半个月的工作量；农村电影队两个月的工作量。每年只映二十多场电影就用了一个放映员，简直是浪费。二、他是青年，他不愿住在风吹不着雨淋不着，夏天有纱窗冬天有暖气的洋楼里，他要到祖国最艰苦的地方去锻炼自己。根据上面两点，他要求到南部边疆去工作，可是领导上强调“工作需要”没有同意。
    他给本报写了两次信，希望支持他的要求。
    我们除希望这个单位的领导同志能够再考虑他的合理要求外，更希望不愿下乡的人能将自己和肖东臣对照一下。
