    The afterglow of the setting sun reddened half the valley. Melting snow dripped along the withered yellow grass stems into the moist soil. The members of the hunting team of the Yanjia Tai Village agricultural cooperative, hid in the bushes and behind the rocks of various mountain passes, watching for the movements of wild animals. This was the time when wild animals came out to look for food.
    Hunting is a major sideline for Yanjia Tai Village in the Beijing Jingxi Mining Area. They get ammunition support from the government and hunt leopards, wild boars, wolves, roe deer, antelopes or foxes, selling the skins to the state, and some use them to make clothes. But the young and middle-aged people of Yanjia Tai Village love hunting, also because the activity is interesting.
    The hunters waited for a while, and sure enough, an antelope came out of a mountain depression, walking slowly down the slope, pushing aside the dry grass leaves, nibbling at the still green sweet roots, then going to the mountain stream to drink spring water, and then walking back peacefully. The hunter waiting in the left mountain depression stared at this fat sheep weighing a good sixty pounds, his eyes turned red, and he aimed and fired a shot, hitting a hind leg with a bang. The antelope, hit by this cold shot, suddenly jumped more than ten feet high, turned around and fled. Zhao Yongcheng, the head of the cooperative squatting on the right mountain top, had been prepared since he heard the gunshot on the left, and fired another shot when the sheep ran closer. The antelope rolled down from the steep cliff, dragging its two injured hind legs, and fled down the mountain for its life.
    Zhao Yong'an, who was guarding the pass at the foot of the mountain, didn't see any movement above for a long time, so he went down the slope to pick up some dry firewood to make a fire. When he heard the gunshot and wanted to climb the slope again, it was too late, and the sheep broke through here and ran into the river beach.
    The river water was dyed red, and the river beach was full of oozing bloodstains. Zhao Yongcheng determined that the sheep would not run far. He led a dozen people down Changgang Tuo and chased north along the river beach. Gradually, the river beach became narrower and narrower, and the stream became deeper and deeper, like an ink ribbon wrapped around the undulating mountains. The bloodstains disappeared here, but the sheep could not have crossed such a deep river. They climbed up the mountain cliffs and continued to move forward. The steep cliff edges were covered with elm trees, and mountain springs dripped down the slopes, forming huge ice pillars, making it impossible to find a place to stand. Even if an antelope passed through here, it would be in danger of sliding into the abyss and rapids. When the hunters passed through here, each person grabbed a handful of soil and sprinkled it on the ice to pad their feet. When they encountered places that were too steep, they used the butt of their guns to flatten the ice, and proceeded step by step, probing carefully. After struggling through the Longtan dangerous pass and climbing up the Wulong Gorge, the sky was already dim, and the mountains surrounded the group like a group of ghostly shadows.
    The bonfire burned with a crackling sound, and the shadows of people reflected on the cave walls jumped non-stop. Some people were snoring loudly with their heads resting on the stone walls, and some were dozing while sitting. Only Zhao Yongcheng and his brother Zhao Yong'an couldn't close their eyes. Zhao Yongcheng looked at his brother's sullen look, knowing that he regretted letting the sheep run away during the day. He wanted to comfort him, but couldn't find the words, so he put the last cigarette butt he had smoked into his pipe and handed it to Yong'an. The brother's stubborn face and the sleeping people around him couldn't help but remind Yongcheng of the days during the War of Resistance against Japan when he led his brother and these comrades to fight guerrillas in the Pingbei Mountains. Yanjia Tai Village was burned to the ground by the enemy, and his mother was killed by the enemy. The enemy also built blockhouses and dug trenches in the village. The guerrillas went to pull out the enemy's strongholds at night, just like hunting mountain sheep today. He never thought that more than ten years later, this group of people would use weapons obtained from fighting the enemy and from the enemy to engage in sideline occupations... A slight movement startled this former guerrilla captain. He found that Yong'an was missing, hurriedly picked up his gun and drilled out of the cave entrance, and saw a dark shadow wriggling under the hillside by the moonlight. Zhao Yongcheng shouted, "Who's there?"
    "It's me," Zhao Yong'an's voice.
    "You're alone, where are you running blindly in the dark?"
    "Everyone hasn't eaten anything all day, I want to take advantage of the moonrise to go back to the village to carry some food."
    "You're really looking for death, do you think you can walk this road in the dark?" Zhao Yongcheng chased to the edge of the forest, but his brother was already gone.
    The next day, this group of people searched around Wulong Gorge for a long time but couldn't find the sheep, so they moved to Xijian. After crossing the river, they were greeted by strange peaks and valleys, and cliffs hundreds of feet high. Every step they took felt like they were pulling something weighing more than a hundred pounds on their legs. It was hard to climb up, and when they looked up, it was another cliff. After crossing five or six cliffs, they approached the snow-covered area. The highest peak, Laokouzi, was more than a thousand meters above sea level, and the snow was always a foot deep, with temperatures below minus twenty degrees Celsius. This group of people were thirsty, hungry, tired, and frozen. No one had the strength to climb up.
    "Damn it, I've never seen hunting a sheep take so much effort," someone cursed with a frustrated face.
    Although they said that, no one wanted to go back empty-handed. Just as they were in a dilemma, someone saw a person climbing up from the foot of the mountain in the distance. That person grabbed the thorny bushes with one hand and supported his body with the other, jumping left and right, more agile than an ape. Everyone hurriedly stood up and shouted, "Zhao Yong'an is bringing food!"
    While taking out steamed buns, liquor, and pickles from his pocket, Zhao Yong'an wiped his sweat and said, "The branch secretary saw that you didn't go back last night, so he arranged for the cooperative to cook and prepare to send it into the mountain early in the morning. If I hadn't run to Wulong Gorge again today, I would have caught up with you earlier."
    After eating and drinking their fill, the group of people smoothly crossed Laokouzi, from where they could see the winding Great Wall and the turbulent Yongding River tributary in the distance. Moving forward, they found the antelope footprints that had not yet been completely covered by the floating snow.

    猎人的脚
    阚甸义
    斜阳的余辉映红了半个山谷，融雪顺着枯黄的草茎滴进湿润的土地，燕家台村农业社打猎组的组员们，藏在山上各要道的灌木丛里和石头后面，观望野兽的动静，这时正是野兽出来寻食的时候。
    打猎是北京京西矿区燕家台村的一项主要副业，他们得到政府弹药的支持，猎获豹子、野猪、狼、狍子、羚羊或狐狸，把皮卖给国家，有的自己做衣服穿。但是燕家台村的青壮年喜爱打猎，还因为这项活动有意思。
    猎人等了一会，果然有只羚羊从山凹里出来，慢吞吞地走下坡子，拨开干草叶，啃那还发绿的甜根，又到山涧去饮泉水，然后安详地往回走。等在左山凹的猎手瞅着这只足有六十斤重的肥羊眼都红了，瞄准就是一枪，嘡的一声击中一条后腿。羚羊挨这冷枪，猛然窜起一丈多高，转身便逃。蹲在右山顶上的社长赵永成，听见左边枪响，早已准备妥当，等羊跑近又是一枪。羚羊从陡绝的悬崖上滚下去，拖着两条受伤的后腿，往山下逃命。
    山下卡口子的赵永安半天不见上边动静，就下了坡子拾几把干柴烤火。当他听见枪响再想爬坡已经来不及，羊就从这里闯下河滩。
    河水染成红色，河滩上满是渍渍的血迹，赵永成断定羊跑不远，他带着十几个人下了长港驼，顺河滩向北追去。渐渐地河滩越来越狭，溪水由浅变深，像一条墨带拦腰缠住起伏的山峦。到这儿血迹已经不见，但是羊也不可能淌过这么深的河。他们攀上山崖继续前进，峻峭的崖边遍是榆树，山泉顺坡滴下，结成巨大的冰柱，连落脚的地方都找不到，就是羚羊经过这里也有滑进深渊激流的危险。猎人经过这里，每人抓把土撒在冰上垫脚，碰见太陡的地方，用枪托把冰铲平，一步步试探着前行。磨蹭过龙潭险道，登上乌龙峡，天色已经暗淡，群山像一群怪影把这伙人包围起来。
    篝火辟啪的燃烧着，映在洞壁上的人影儿跳动不停，有人斜枕石壁鼾声大作，有人坐着打盹，只有赵永成和赵永安哥俩合不上眼。赵永成看着弟弟闷闷不乐的劲儿，知道他懊悔白天放跑羊的事，本想安慰他几句，可又找不到话说，就将抽剩下的最后一支烟头装入烟袋锅，递给永安。弟弟执拗的面孔和周围熟睡的人们，不禁使永成想起抗战时期，他领着弟弟和这些战友，在平北山区打游击的日子。燕家台村被敌人放火烧光，娘给敌人杀害了，敌人还在村上筑炮楼，挖堑壕。游击队晚上去拔掉敌军据点，就仿佛今天打山羊似的。想不到十几年后，这伙人用打敌人和从敌人手中得来的武器来搞副业……一点动静把这位过去的游击队长惊醒，他发现永安不见了，急忙提起枪钻出洞口，借月光望见山坡下有个黑影蠕动。赵永成喊道：“谁？”
    “我。”赵永安的声音。
    “你一个人，魅黑的往哪瞎跑？”
    “大家一天没吃啥，我想趁月亮上来，回村背点吃的去。”
    “真是找死，就凭你黑里还想走这条道？”赵永成追到林子边，弟弟已经不见了。
    第二天，这伙人在乌龙峡围了半晌不见羊，就转移到西涧去，过了河眼前竟是奇峰异壑，好几十丈高的悬崖峭壁，每爬一步都像有百多斤重的东西拉住腿一样费劲，好容易登上去，抬头一看，又是一座悬崖峭壁。翻过五六座崖子，才接近积雪区，最高峰老口子拔海一千多公尺，终年积雪盈尺，气温在摄氏零下二十度以下。这伙人又渴又饿，又累又冻，谁也没力气爬上去。
    “真他妈倒楣，没见过打只羊费这么大劲儿。”有人沮丧着脸骂道。
    话虽这么说，谁也不愿意空手回去。正是进退维谷的时候，有人老远就望见山下爬上一个人来。那个人一只手抓住荆条，一只手支撑着身子，左攀右跳，比猿猴还灵巧。大家急忙站起来嚷道：“赵永安送饭来了！”
    赵永安一面从口袋里掏馒头、烧酒和咸菜，一面擦汗说：“支书见你们昨晚没回去，就张罗社里做饭，准备一早送进山。今天若不是我又跑趟乌龙峡，也早追上你们了。”
    吃饱喝足，一伙人顺利地翻过老口子，从这里遥遥望见蜿蜒曲折的万里长城和波涛滚滚的永定河支流。再往前走，他们又找到了还没有完全被浮雪掩盖住的羚羊脚印。
