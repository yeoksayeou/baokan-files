Two Important Developments in the Current International Situation
　　Gu Si
　　Two particularly noteworthy developments in the current international situation are: the continuous strengthening of the unity and cooperation among socialist countries; and the continued advancement of the national independence movement and anti-colonialist struggle in Middle Eastern countries after the Egyptian people defeated the Anglo-French aggressors. Imperialists, especially the U.S. aggressive bloc, fearing that the international situation will turn towards relaxation, are still carrying out conspiracies to undermine the unity between socialist countries and to strike at anti-colonialist forces.
　　I. The Unity of Socialist Countries is Constantly Strengthening
　　Recently, socialist countries, led by the Soviet Union, have been working hard to strengthen and close their relations with each other, and have achieved new and significant successes.
　　Since November of last year, socialist countries have held bilateral and multilateral talks in various forms. Particularly important among these were: the Soviet-Polish and Soviet-Romanian talks; the five-nation talks between Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia; the Soviet-German talks; the Chinese-German talks; the three-nation talks between the Soviet Union, China, and Hungary; and the talks between China and the Soviet Union, China and Poland, China and Hungary, and the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. All of these talks sincerely exchanged views on important issues in the current international situation, on further strengthening the unity among socialist countries, and on developing mutual relations, and reached a consensus. These talks undoubtedly further strengthened the relations between socialist countries, further enhanced the strength of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, and severely打击 [dǎ jī - strike] the imperialists' conspiracy to weaken and undermine the unity of socialist countries.
　　Tremendous Achievements
　　The results of the talks between socialist countries unanimously agreed that the root cause of international tension lies in: the consistent pursuit of expansionist policies by the imperialist aggressive bloc headed by the United States. It actively expands armaments, organizes military blocs, constantly interferes in the internal affairs of other countries, conducts subversive activities against socialist countries, launched the aggression against Egypt, organized the armed rebellion in Hungary, and has recently promoted the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in an attempt to enslave the people of the Near and Middle East. At the same time, socialist countries expressed their confidence that as long as socialist countries unite more closely, they can effectively defend the achievements of socialist construction, defend the independence of socialist countries, and defend world peace.
　　These talks, based on the principles of proletarian internationalism and Lenin's national equality, adopted sincere consultation and comradely discussion, not only further strengthened unity on a common ideological foundation, but also decided to take practical steps such as loans and the provision of materials and equipment to support each other's socialist construction. The complete consensus of socialist countries on the current international situation, the further improvement of mutual relations, and the provision of mutual assistance have undoubtedly consolidated and strengthened the unity of socialist countries on a more solid foundation, and promoted the development of the great cause of socialist construction in various countries.
　　Recently, a series of meetings have been held in various socialist countries to conduct a serious review of past work and make new arrangements for future work. In December of last year, the Central Committee of the CPSU held a plenary session and adopted a resolution on improving economic leadership and adjusting national economic issues; Poland held parliamentary elections, and the Polish National Front led by the United Workers' Party achieved a great victory, further consolidating the socialist system; the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government is taking measures to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. This has greatly strengthened the ties between the parties and governments of socialist countries and the working people.
　　The Imperialist Conspiracy is Bound to Fail
　　However, it is worth noting that the imperialist aggressive bloc headed by the United States is not reconciled to its defeat. They are intensifying their efforts to undermine the unity of socialist countries, vainly attempting to split the socialist camp. Because they know that as long as the unity of socialist countries is undermined or weakened, it can realize its ambition to defeat them one by one and enslave all progressive humanity. They are attempting to create "national communism" within socialist countries and change the "nature of the communist world." They are still intensifying the anti-Soviet and anti-communist movement. They have not given up their attempt to use the United Nations to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs. The Hungarian events proved the paramount importance of socialist countries using mutual assistance to deal with any provocation or subversion by imperialism. At the same time, socialist countries must continue to be vigilant, see through all the imperialist conspiracies and tricks; further consolidate the unity between our socialist countries, consolidate the internal unity of our socialist countries, and consolidate the unity between socialist countries and peace-loving countries and peace-loving people. Only in this way can all the imperialist conspiracies and tricks to undermine the unity of socialist countries and the progressive cause of all mankind be thoroughly bankrupt. Facts have proven and will prove that all the conspiracies and fantasies of imperialism are bound to fail and be shattered. In the end, it will not be the communist world that will be changed in nature, but the capitalist world.
　　II. The Situation in the Middle East After the Failure of the Anglo-French Invasion of Egypt
　　1957 unfolds a bright picture before the people of the Middle East. The great victory won by the Egyptian people in resisting the Anglo-French aggressors proved that the anti-colonialist forces can overwhelm the colonialist forces, and that the forces of peace are greater than the forces of war. This vivid fact has brought great encouragement to the people of the Middle East and the world.
　　New Upsurge of the National Independence Movement
　　After the failure of the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, the national independence movement in the Middle East has undergone new developments. Egypt abolished the 1954 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, canceling Britain's last privilege in Egypt, namely, the right of British troops to be stationed at the Suez Canal base when Arab countries are subjected to aggression. The Egyptian government also announced that all foreign enterprises in Egypt would be nationalized and owned by Egyptian citizens. At the same time, Jordan insisted on abolishing the 1948 Anglo-Jordanian Treaty and accepted financial assistance from Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia, thereby further breaking away from British control. The people of Yemen are fighting to safeguard their territorial sovereignty.
　　Within the Baghdad Pact countries, there is also a growing call for changing the current policies in opposition to following Western colonial countries. For many years, Western countries have been saying that Middle Eastern countries must "unite" with them to "defend against aggression"; however, in the end, it was the Western countries themselves who launched aggressive wars and massacred the people of the Middle East! Under such circumstances, this already unpopular Baghdad Pact became even more fragmented. The fact that Britain was unable to attend the three meetings of the Baghdad Pact countries from the outbreak of the Egyptian war until recently is enough to illustrate the state of the treaty.
　　Of course, the Anglo-French colonialists are not reconciled to their failure. They are supporting the Israeli forces, which invaded Egypt with them, to occupy Egyptian territory, and continue to plot to realize the bankrupt plan of "international control" of the Suez Canal. The Egyptian war did not even teach the British and French the lessons they deserved. Britain is still brandishing its swords and guns, launching armed attacks on Yemen; the French colonialists have stated that they will continue to act recklessly in Algeria. But in any case, the colonial power of Britain and France in the Middle East has plummeted. They cannot save the collapse of the Middle Eastern colonial system, nor can they save the political and economic crises that have occurred in Britain and France due to the failure of the war of aggression. Eden, like Don Quixote tilting at windmills, was shot down along with his lance, and he quietly went to New Zealand to spend the rest of his life. This is not an unfaithful portrayal of the declining British colonial empire.
　　With the collapse of the Anglo-French colonial system in the Middle East, a new Middle East has risen. The people of the Middle East will not allow imperialism to regard the Middle East as their colony and sphere of influence, but are determined to build independent and free countries on their own land. The people of the Middle East will not allow imperialism to regard the Middle East as their arena and source of war, but are determined to turn their homeland into a peaceful area.
　　Washington is Alarmed
　　However, this trend has alarmed the gentlemen in Washington. As soon as the flames of war in Egypt were extinguished, the United States suddenly announced the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" targeting Middle Eastern countries. On January 5, U.S. President Eisenhower submitted a special message to Congress on Middle East policy, and then the likes of Dulles shouted and hawked to promote this policy. What exactly is the "Eisenhower Doctrine"? To sum it up, its content is: First, the United States completely disregards the will of Middle Eastern countries and abandons the United Nations, and proclaims itself the protector of Middle Eastern countries, and divides the Middle East into the U.S. sphere of protection. Second, the United States announced that it can use armed forces in the Middle East whenever the U.S. President deems it necessary. In other words, the United States has the "right" to act freely in the Middle East and can carry out military provocations and armed attacks anytime and anywhere. Third, the United States requires Middle Eastern countries to engage in "military cooperation" with it, and the United States will help establish "security forces" to maintain "order" in Middle Eastern countries. In this way, the United States again proclaims that it has the "right" to interfere in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries. Fourth, the United States stipulates that it will use 400 million U.S. dollars to aid Middle Eastern countries within two years. Although this amount of money is only a drop in the bucket compared to the huge profits the United States has extracted from the Middle East, the United States wants to use it to buy the hearts of the Middle Eastern people.
　　In order to cover up the true face of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," the United States once again sang the old tune of anti-Soviet and anti-communist, insisting that the Soviet Union is "threatening" the Middle East. The United States also invented a theory that since the colonial power of Britain and France has disappeared, the Middle East has become a "power vacuum" that must be "filled" by the United States. These Washington gentlemen simply regard the Middle East as a large kindergarten, and they are convinced that by fabricating such a ghost story, they can deceive millions of Middle Eastern people.
　　The Purpose of the "Eisenhower Doctrine"
　　The real purpose of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is very clear. Originally, the United States has always been hostile to the Middle Eastern national independence movement. When Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal Company, the United States believed that Egypt's just action had offended the colonial countries. Therefore, although it did not directly participate in the invasion of Egypt for various reasons and considerations, the United States believed that the actions of its "friends" Britain and France were "intolerable." The United States pretended to be a "peacemaker" on the surface, but in reality, it supported Britain and France in "punishing" Egypt and hoped to create a situation where both sides suffered, so as to profit from it. It is precisely because of this that it now sees that the military adventures of Britain and France have failed and the Middle Eastern national independence movement has become more vigorous, so it has come out to suppress it with equal "intolerance." It has abandoned the banner of "peace" and "anti-colonialism" and has transformed from the role of "pulling the cart from the side" to the main "thug." The "Eisenhower Doctrine" announced a policy of "military deterrence" against the Middle East, which is clearly an attempt to intimidate and interfere with Middle Eastern countries that adhere to independence.
　　At the same time, the United States sees that due to the failure of Britain and France, the balance of power of colonial countries in the Middle East has undergone drastic changes. The United States believes that it has obtained a rare opportunity to take advantage of the "vacuum" to enter and replace the colonial status of Britain and France and expand the territory of the American colonial empire in the Middle East.
　　From the perspective of the overall international situation, the United States is unwilling to see the international tension easing again due to the cessation of the Egyptian war, and it is also unwilling to see all Western military groups relax due to the bankruptcy of the Baghdad Pact. Therefore, the United States is using the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to create tension and cheer up those countries that follow the United States, so as to continue to promote the U.S. power policy and war preparations.
　　From the perspective of the domestic situation in the United States, the announcement of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is also for the purpose of passing a huge military budget. This year's U.S. budget totals 71.8 billion U.S. dollars, of which more than two-thirds is military spending.
　　It can be seen that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is entirely a weapon of the U.S. colonial expansion policy and power policy. Dulles admitted that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" has "the most fundamental commonalities" with the Truman Plan, the Marshall Plan, the Atlantic Alliance, and the Southeast Asia Treaty, etc. In fact, the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is a continuation of a series of U.S. aggression plans since World War II. The United States itself came out to tell everyone that its policy is consistent, and the most fundamental thing is crazy aggressiveness.
　　A Strong Protest
　　But what is unfortunate for the aggressors is that they have calculated everything, but they have forgotten the people. As soon as the "Eisenhower Doctrine" came out, it was met with fierce criticism from many government officials and public opinion in Arab and Asian-African countries. People unanimously pointed out that this is an imperialist plan, a colonialist plan, a war plan, and a vicious attack by the United States on the people of the Middle East and the people of Asia and Africa. Therefore, it aroused a strong protest in the vast areas of Asia and Africa.
　　In the Western world, the "Eisenhower Doctrine" was superficially "welcomed" by the British and French governments. The Anglo-French aggressors had something to say: Look! The United States also advocates a policy of armed suppression in the Middle East, just like us, which proves that the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt was "correct"! British diplomatic officials even revealed a sense of "pioneer" "pride." However, the Anglo-French colonialists are more sensitive than anyone to the fact that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is going to undermine their foundations. Therefore, Britain has repeatedly requested that the United States be able to combine the "Eisenhower Doctrine" with the Baghdad Pact, implying a plea for leniency. French Foreign Minister Pineau shouted that the Middle East does not include North Africa and posted a "Stop Here" sign. The "Eisenhower Doctrine" actually announced that the United States would "go it alone," and it was no longer a situation of dividing the spoils among the three countries. As for whether the Middle East includes Mr. Pineau's North Africa, Dulles would rather be laughed at for not having geographical knowledge than refuse to answer this question. All these situations show that the announcement of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" will intensify the contradictions between the United States and Britain and France.
　　As for the United States, there is also resistance to the promotion of the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Everyone sees that this plan is full of gunpowder. The American people are unwilling to participate in risky provocations. Some members of Congress also opposed giving the U.S. president "the power to send American youth to any foreign country to die."
　　The Middle East Belongs to the People of the Middle East
　　The "Eisenhower Doctrine" has posed a major threat to the independent countries of the Middle East and brought a new atmosphere of tension to the Middle East situation, which has just returned to peace. However, as long as the people of the Middle Eastern countries and the people of Asia and Africa can recognize the face of imperialism and unite to carry out a resolute struggle, then both Anglo-French colonialism and American colonialism can be defeated. The Middle East belongs to the people of the Middle East, and the fate of the Middle East will be determined by the people of the Middle East themselves, and not by the U.S. State Department and the U.S. President. The trend and mainstream of the international situation will be determined by the wishes and strength of the people of all countries in the world, and not by the U.S. aggressive bloc. 1957 will surely bring new victories to the cause of peace, independence, and progress for all mankind.

### 当前国际局势中的两个重要发展

    当前国际局势中的两个重要发展
    顾思
    当前国际局势中特别值得注意的两个重要发展是：社会主义各国的团结和合作，正在不断加强中；在埃及人民打败了英法侵略者以后，中东各国的民族独立运动和反殖民主义斗争继续前进。帝国主义者特别是美国侵略集团害怕国际局势转趋和缓，仍然在进行着破坏社会主义阵营之间的团结和打击反殖民主义力量的阴谋活动。
    一、社会主义国家的团结在不断增强
    最近以来，以苏联为首的社会主义各国，正在努力加强和密切相互之间的关系，而且已经取得了新的重大成就。
    去年11月以来，社会主义各国之间曾举行了各种形式的双边和多边的会谈。其中特别重要的有：苏波、苏罗会谈，保、匈、罗、苏、捷五国会谈，苏德会谈，中德会谈，苏、中、匈三国会谈，中苏、中波、中匈和苏捷等国之间的会谈。所有这些会谈，都对目前国际局势中的重要问题，对进一步加强社会主义各国之间的团结和发展相互之间的关系，真诚地交换了意见，并取得了一致的认识。这些会谈无疑进一步加强了社会主义国家之间的关系，更加增强了以苏联为首社会主义阵营的力量，严重地打击了帝国主义者企图削弱和破坏社会主义国家团结的阴谋。
    巨大的成果
    社会主义国家之间的会谈的结果一致认为，国际紧张局势的根源在于：以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团一贯推行扩张政策。它积极扩充军备，组织军事集团，不断干涉他国内政和对社会主义国家进行颠覆活动，发动对埃及的侵略和组织匈牙利的武装叛乱，最近更推行“艾森豪威尔主义”企图奴役中近东人民。同时，社会主义各国满怀信心地表示，只要社会主义国家更加紧密地团结起来就能有效地保卫社会主义建设的成就，保卫社会主义国家的独立，保卫世界的和平。
    这些会谈根据无产阶级国际主义与列宁的民族平等的原则，采取真诚协商和同志式的讨论，不但在共同的思想基础上进一步加强了团结，而且还决定采取贷款，提供物资、设备等实际步骤，相互支援社会主义建设。社会主义各国对目前国际局势认识的完全一致，相互关系的进一步改进和相互提供援助，无疑地已在更加坚实的基础上巩固和加强了社会主义国家的团结，促进了各国的社会主义建设的伟大事业发展。
    最近，各社会主义国家曾举行了一系列的会议，对过去的工作作了认真的检查并对今后的工作作了新的部署。去年12月苏共中央召开了全会，通过了关于改善经济领导工作和调整国民经济问题的决议；波兰进行了议会选举，以统一工人党为领导的波兰全国阵线取得了伟大胜利，进一步巩固了社会主义制度；匈牙利工农革命政府正在采取措施加强无产阶级专政。这样就大大加强了社会主义各国党和政府和劳动人民的联系。
    帝国主义的阴谋一定失败
    但是，值得警惕的是，目前以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团，并不甘心于它们的失败。它们还在加紧破坏社会主义国家的团结，妄想分裂社会主义阵营。因为他们知道，只要破坏或者削弱了社会主义国家的团结，它就能实现其各个击破和奴役全世界进步人类的野心。它们企图在社会主义国家内部，制造“民族共产主义”和改变“共产主义世界的性质”。它们仍在加紧进行反苏反共的运动。它们并没有放弃利用联合国干涉匈牙利内政的企图。匈牙利事件证明了社会主义国家用相互协助的行动来对付帝国主义任何挑衅、颠覆行为的头等重要性。同时社会主义国家还必须继续提高警惕，识破帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计；更加巩固我们社会主义各国之间的团结，巩固我们社会主义国家内部的团结，巩固社会主义国家和爱好和平国家和爱好和平的人民的团结。只有这样，帝国主义破坏社会主义国家的团结和全世界人类进步事业的一切阴谋诡计，才能遭到彻底的破产。事实已经证明而且还要证明，帝国主义的一切阴谋和幻想一定要失败和破灭的。最后将被改变性质的决不是共产主义世界，而必然是资本主义世界。
    二、英法侵埃失败后的中东局势
    1957年在中东人民面前展开一片光明的图景。埃及人民反抗英法侵略者所赢得的伟大胜利，证明了反殖民主义力量是能够压倒殖民主义势力的，和平力量是大于战争势力的。这个活生生的事实给中东以及全世界人民带来极大的鼓舞。
    民族独立运动的新高涨
    在英法侵略埃及失败以后，中东地区的民族独立运动又有了新的发展。埃及废除了1954年的英埃条约，取消了英国在埃及的最后特权，即英军在阿拉伯国家遭受侵略时可以进驻苏伊士运河基地的权利。埃及政府并宣布一切外国在埃及的企业收归埃及公民所有。同时，约旦坚持要求废除1948年的英约条约，并接受了埃及、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯的财政援助，从而进一步摆脱了英国的控制。也门人民正为维护自己的领土主权而斗争。
    在巴格达条约国家的内部，反对追随西方殖民国家、要求改变现行政策的呼声也在增长。许多年来，西方国家口口声声说：中东国家必须同它们“联合”起来“防卫侵略”；可是，到头来发动侵略战争、屠杀中东人民的却正是西方国家自己！在这种情况下，这个本来就不得人心的巴格达条约更加支离破碎了。从埃及战争爆发直到最近，巴格达条约国家开了三次会议，英国都未能参加，就足以说明这个条约的状况。
    当然，英法殖民者对他们的失败并不甘心。他们正在支持同他们一起侵略埃及的以色列部队占据埃及领土，并且继续图谋实现破产了的“国际管制”苏伊士运河的计划。埃及战争甚至也没有使英法得到应有的教训，英国还在舞弄刀枪，武装进攻也门；法国殖民者则表示要在阿尔及利亚蛮干下去。但是，不论如何，英法在中东地区的殖民势力已经一落千丈。他们不但无法挽救中东殖民体系的瓦解，而且无法挽救由于侵略战争失败在英法国内发生的政治和经济危机。艾登像斗风车的唐吉呵德一样连人带枪被打下马来，他悄悄地远走新西兰消度余生去了。这未尝不是没落的大英殖民帝国的一个写照。
    随着英法在中东的殖民体系的瓦解，一个新的中东站起来了。中东人民不允许帝国主义再把中东作为它们的殖民地和势力范围，而决心在自己的土地上建立独立自由的国家。中东人民不允许帝国主义再把中东作为它们的角逐场和战争策源地，而决心把自己的国土变为一片和平地区。
    华盛顿惊慌了
    但是，这种趋势却使华盛顿的老爷们惊慌起来了。埃及战火刚刚熄灭，美国就突然宣布了针对中东国家的所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”。1月5日，美国总统艾森豪威尔向国会提出了关于中东政策的特别咨文，然后杜勒斯之流就大叫大喊来推销这个政策。究竟什么叫“艾森豪威尔主义”呢？综括起来说，它的内容就是：一，美国根本不顾中东国家的意志，并且抛开了联合国，而自封为中东国家的保护者，把中东划为美国的保护地区。二，美国宣布，只要美国总统认为必要的时候，美国就可以在中东使用武装部队。也就是说，美国有“权”在中东自由行动，随时随地都可以进行军事挑衅和武装进攻。三，美国要求中东国家同它实行“军事合作”，并由美国帮助建立“保安部队”，以便维持中东国家的“秩序”。这样，美国又自封它有“权”干涉中东国家内政。四，美国规定用四亿美元在两年内援助中东国家。虽然这笔钱同美国从中东榨取的巨大利润比较起来只是九牛一毛，可是美国却想用它来收买中东人民的心。
    为了掩盖“艾森豪威尔主义”的真面目，美国又来大唱反苏反共的滥调，硬说什么苏联在“威胁”中东。美国还发明一种理论说，由于英法殖民势力消逝了，中东就成了“势力真空”，而必须由美国来“填补”。这些华盛顿老爷们简直把中东看成一所大幼儿园，他们满以为这样胡诌一篇鬼话，就可以把千百万中东人民都蒙骗了。
    “艾森豪威尔主义”的目的
    “艾森豪威尔主义”的真正目的很清楚。本来，美国一直是敌视中东民族独立运动的。当埃及把苏伊士运河公司收归国有时，美国就认为埃及这种正义的行动是触犯了殖民国家。所以，它虽然由于种种原因和打算没有直接参加侵略埃及战争，但是美国却认为它的“朋友”英法的行动是“忍无可忍的”。美国表面上扮成“和事佬”，实际上是支持英法“惩罚”埃及，并且希望造成两败俱伤，以便从中渔利。正是因为这样，现在它看到英法的军事冒险失败了，中东民族独立运动更加高涨了，就同样“忍无可忍”地出来镇压。它抛开了“和平”和“反殖民主义”的幌子，从“拉边架”的角色一变而为主要“打手”。“艾森豪威尔主义”宣布对中东实行“军事威慑”政策，显然就是企图恫吓和干涉坚持独立的中东国家。
    同时，美国看到，由于英法的失败，殖民国家在中东地区的势力对比发生了急剧的变化。美国认为它得到了一个难得的机会，可以乘“虚”而入，代替英法的殖民地位，在中东扩张美利坚殖民帝国的地盘。
    从整个国际局势来讲，美国不愿意看到由于埃及战争停止而使国际紧张局势重新缓和下来，它也不愿意看到由于巴格达条约的破产而影响西方军事集团都松懈下来。于是，美国就利用“艾森豪威尔主义”来制造紧张局势，并给那些追随美国的国家打气，以便继续推行美国实力政策和备战计划。
    从美国国内情况来讲，“艾森豪威尔主义”的宣布也是为了通过庞大的军事预算。今年度美国预算共达七百一十八亿美元，其中三分之二以上是军费。
    由此可见，“艾森豪威尔主义”完全是美国殖民扩张政策和实力政策的一个武器。杜勒斯承认，“艾森豪威尔主义”同杜鲁门计划、马歇尔计划、大西洋联盟和东南亚条约等等有“最根本的共同点”。实际上，“艾森豪威尔主义”就是美国在第二次世界大战以后一系列侵略计划的继续。美国自己出来告诉大家，它的政策是万变不离其宗的，最根本的东西就是疯狂的侵略性。
    一片强烈的抗议声
    但是侵略者倒霉的是，他们把什么都计算到了，就是忘记了人民。“艾森豪威尔主义”一露头，就遭到阿拉伯国家和亚非国家的许多政府人士以及广大舆论的猛烈抨击。人们一致指出，这是帝国主义的计划，是殖民主义的计划，是战争的计划，是美国对中东人民以及亚非人民的凶恶进攻。因此，它激起了亚非广大地区的一片强烈的抗议声。
    在西方世界，“艾森豪威尔主义”受到了英法政府的表面上的“欢迎”。英法侵略者有话说了：看！美国也同我们一样主张在中东实行武力镇压政策了，这证明英法侵略埃及是“正确”的！英国外交官员甚至流露出一种“先驱者”的“自豪感”。然而，英法殖民者比谁都更敏感地觉察到“艾森豪威尔主义”是要挖他们的墙脚。所以，英国一再要求美国能够把“艾森豪威尔主义”同巴格达条约结合起来，暗示了手下留情的哀求。法国外长比诺则大喊中东不包括北非，挂出了一张“请君止步”的牌子。“艾森豪威尔主义”实际上宣布了美国要“单独干”，早已不是三国分赃的局面了。至于中东究竟包括不包括比诺先生的北非，杜勒斯宁肯让人家笑话他没有地理常识，而拒绝回答这个问题。这些情况都说明，“艾森豪威尔主义”的宣布势将加剧美国同英法之间的矛盾。
    至于在美国国内，推行“艾森豪威尔主义”也并不是没有阻力的。大家都看到，这个计划是充满着火药气息的。美国人民不愿意参加冒险挑衅。有一些议员也反对给予美国总统把“美国青年派到任何外国去送死的权力”。
    中东是属于中东人民的
    “艾森豪威尔主义”已经对中东独立国家造成重大威胁，并且给刚刚恢复和平的中东局势带来新的紧张空气。但是，只要中东各国人民和亚非人民能够认清帝国主义的面目，并团结起来进行坚决的斗争，那么不论是英法殖民主义，还是美国殖民主义都是可以打败的。中东是属于中东人民的，中东的命运将决定于中东人民自己，而不决定于美国国务院和美国总统。国际局势的趋向和主流将决定于世界各国人民的愿望和力量，而不决定于美国侵略集团。1957年，一定会给全人类带来和平、独立与进步事业的新胜利。
