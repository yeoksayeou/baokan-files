From the Chu Opera "Fei Gongzhi's Wisdom"

Some opera genres, originally folk operas, have accumulated a batch of opera repertoires reflecting modern urban life as they entered cities due to changes in the audience. Among these repertoires, the most numerous are those reflecting contemporary life and depicting local neighborhoods and family events. Northern Pingju, Eastern Hu Opera, and Hubei Chu Opera, among others, all have such repertoires.

Some of these genres' repertoires do indeed exhibit the vulgar tastes of the petty bourgeoisie and are of low quality. However, one cannot conclude from this that all opera repertoires depicting the life of citizens from the late Qing Dynasty to the eve of the national liberation are bad plays with petty-bourgeois interests, vulgar and worthless, and have nothing of value. Specific analysis is needed for specific repertoires to distinguish between their essence and dross.

When the authors of these repertoires began writing in those days, they mostly considered the audience's appreciation habits for opera. Although they were modern dramas, they often inherited the traditional expressive methods of opera in terms of the writing method and stage art. Now, our newly created opera repertoires reflecting real life, and even newly written historical opera repertoires, sometimes deviate far from the traditional expressive methods of opera, and the audience says they don't look like opera. In terms of how to inherit traditional expressive methods, the aforementioned repertoires do have something worth learning from.

At the recently concluded First Hubei Provincial Opera Performance and Observation Meeting, the Wuhan delegation performed a Chu Opera called "Fei Gongzhi's Wisdom," which belongs to this category of repertoire. This play tells the story of Fei Gongzhi, who abandoned two wives, went away for many years, and upon returning, flirted with his own daughter, Qiu Ju, whom he did not recognize in the hotel. At his second wife Shi Guiying's house, he encountered his first wife Che Lihong working as a servant. Finally, filled with remorse and shame, he committed suicide. The play depicts Fei Gongzhi's selfish, despicable, and cowardly character and complex mental state realistically and vividly; Che Lihong's depression, indignation, and struggle in the face of the ugly reality, as well as her overall understanding of the situation after learning the truth, and Shi Guiying's innocence, liveliness, and sincere love for her husband are also well-written. From the author's attitude towards the characters and the overall inclination of the work, this play should be said to have progressive significance in contemporary times.

The reason why this play can leave a deep impression on the audience and move people is also because it uses traditional expressive methods of opera in its script writing and stage art. For example, this play unfolds its plot from beginning to end, following the activities of the main character, Fei Gongzhi, and does not adopt the scene division method of spoken drama. The author appropriately arranges monologues, back bows, shouts, singing, and narration for the characters as needed. When the characters are in a state of intensified conflict, the stage presents scenes full of dramatic passion that stir the heartstrings due to the exaggerated emphasis on performance and the atmosphere created by gongs and drums on the scene. For example, to express the environment of the garden, no three-dimensional hard pieces were used, only a green rattan chair, but the audience was brought to that virtual scene of blooming flowers and butterflies vying for spring because the character used opera's lyrical solo singing and dance movements in the performance. The entire play's singing style basically uses Chu Opera tunes, without starting a new one. In general, this play reflects modern life using traditional expressive methods, although there are many awkward places, such as actors wearing long gowns entering the stage in the sound of long hammers and gongs, which is very unnatural; however, many of its good experiences are enlightening to us.

That day, on the opera performance stage of the Hubei Theater in Wuchang, this play was performed by Chu Opera famous actor Comrade Yuan Biyu and others. We have rarely had the opportunity to see "modern dramas" like "Fei Gongzhi" in recent years. Recently, various places have been excavating traditional opera repertoires, and some of these plays have reappeared on today's stage. I am taking "Fei Gongzhi" as an example, hoping to arouse the attention of comrades working in opera to this type of play.

    由楚剧“费公智”想起的
    大珂
    有些剧种，本来是民间小戏，进入城市后，由于观众对象有了变化，在其发展过程中，也积累了一批反映近代城市生活的戏曲剧目。在这类剧目中，以反映当代生活，表现地方里闾、家庭事件的戏为最多。像北方的评剧、华东的沪剧、湖北的楚剧等剧种，都有这类剧目。
    这些剧种的这类剧目，有些确有市民阶层的庸俗趣味，格调不高。但不能由此得出结论，说凡是表现清末至全国解放前的市民生活的戏曲剧目都是小市民趣味的庸俗不堪的坏戏，一无可取。这里需要对具体剧目进行具体分析，分清它们的精华和糟粕。
    这类剧目的作者在当日动笔的时候，大抵是考虑到戏曲观众的欣赏习惯的。虽然是时装戏，可是在编剧方法上，在舞台艺术方面，往往继承了戏曲传统的表现方法。现在我们新创作的反映现实生活的戏曲剧目，甚至于新编的历史题材的戏曲剧目，有时脱离戏曲传统的表现方法很远，观众看了说不像戏曲。前面所说的这类剧目，在如何继承传统的表现方法这一点上，确有值得借鉴的地方。
    在刚刚结束的湖北省第一届戏曲观摩演出大会上，武汉市代表团演了一出楚剧“费公智”，就是这一类的剧目。这出戏写一个遗弃了两个老婆的费公智，外出多年，归来后，在旅店中调戏了并不相识的亲女儿秋菊，在次妻施桂英家里又遇到作佣工的原配车丽红，最后悔愧交集，终于自杀的一段故事。这出戏写费公智的自私、卑鄙、怯懦的性格和复杂的精神面貌是真实和生动的；车丽红的抑郁、愤懑以及在丑恶现实面前的挣扎，在知道了事情真相后的识大体，施桂英的天真、活泼、对丈夫真挚的爱，写得也都不错。从作者对待人物的态度和作品总的倾向上来看，这个戏在当代，应当说是有进步意义的。
    这出戏之所以能给观众留下较深的印象、能感动人，还在于它在剧本编写上、在舞台艺术上，是运用了戏曲的传统表现方法。譬如，这出戏自始至终是追随着主要人物费公智的活动展开戏剧情节的，并没有采取话剧的分幕分场的方法。作者按照需要，恰当地给人物安排了独白、背躬、叫头以及唱、念等。在人物处于冲突尖锐化的时候，由于表演上的夸张强调以及场面上锣鼓的烘托气氛，舞台上出现了具有戏剧激情的场面，动人心弦。再如表现花园的环境，并没有用立体硬片，只用一把绿色藤椅，但由于角色在表演上运用了戏曲的抒情独唱和舞蹈动作，就把观众带到了那个虚拟的花开似锦、蜂蝶争春的情境中去。整出戏的唱腔，基本上用的是楚剧曲调，也没有另起炉灶新搞一套。总的来说，这出戏用传统的表现方法反映近代生活，虽然也有很多生硬的地方，像穿着长衫的演员，在长槌锣鼓声中上场，就很不自然；然而它的很多好的经验，对我们是有启发作用的。
    那一天，在武昌湖北剧场的戏曲会演舞台上，是由楚剧名演员袁璧玉同志等演出的这出戏。像“费公智”这一类的“时装戏”，几年来，我们很少有机会看到。最近各地都在挖掘戏曲传统剧目，这一类戏也有一些重新出现在今天的舞台上。我以“费公智”这出戏为例，希望能引起做戏曲工作的同志们对这类戏的注意。
