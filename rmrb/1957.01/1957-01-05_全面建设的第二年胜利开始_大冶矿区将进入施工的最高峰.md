Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 4th: Mining construction workers operating excavators, drilling machines, bulldozers and other construction machinery stripped rock and overburden from the peaks of Jianshan and Shizishan in the Daye Iron Mine in 1956, an amount nearly equal to a quarter of the total stripping volume of the first phase of the Daye Iron Mine construction project. The Jianshan work area, which started first, has seen its peak disappear; the top of Shizishan has also been developed into a flat working surface, leaving only half of the mountain peak standing. The valley where waste rock was dumped has now been filled into a wide square, where the builders have newly built work sheds, garages, and a soccer field.

The first phase of the electrical locomotive railway connecting the Wuchang-Daye Railway to the top of the mine has been basically completed for its line and station subgrade. Anti-corrosion sleepers and steel rails have begun to be transported to the construction site. The subgrade meanders from the mountainside all the way to the top of Shizishan.

1956 was the first year of comprehensive construction at the Daye Iron Mine. In 1957, the mining area will enter its peak construction period, with a construction scale several times larger than in 1956. Before the New Year, mining construction workers began to open up and clear new working surfaces in the Jianshan and Shizishan work areas, mobilizing construction machinery and materials, and building new transportation lines. New technical workers needed for construction in 1957 had already begun to be trained in the third quarter of 1956.

    全面建设的第二年胜利开始
    大冶矿区将进入施工的最高峰
    新华社武汉4日电　操纵着电铲、穿孔机和推土机等施工机械的矿山建设者们，1956年从大冶铁矿的尖山、狮子山顶剥去的岩石和浮土，差不多等于大冶铁矿第一期建设工程剥离总量的四分之一。首先开工的尖山工区，山峰已经消失了；狮子山顶也开拓出了平坦的工作面，只剩下半边山峰立在那里。倒置废石的山谷，现在被填筑成宽阔的广场，建设者们在那里新建了工棚、汽车库和足球场。
    连接武昌—大冶铁路通向矿山山顶的电气机车铁路，第一期工程的线路和车站路基，已经基本上建成了。防腐枕木和钢轨已经开始运到工地。路基从半山腰里迂回蜿蜒而上，直达狮子山顶。
    1956年是大冶铁矿开始全面施工的第一年。1957年，这个矿区将进入施工的最高峰，它的建设规模比1956年大几倍。矿山建设者们在新年以前，就开始在尖山、狮子山工区开辟和清理新的工作面，调集施工机械和材料，修筑新的运输线路。1957年建设需要的新的技术工人，也早在1956年第三季度就开始培养训练了。
