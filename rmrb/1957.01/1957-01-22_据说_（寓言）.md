    It is said…
    (Fable)
    "In the beginning, you let the peacock starve?"
    "I wanted to starve it so it couldn't lift its tail. Because, it is said that peacocks are arrogant and conceited. When they encounter beautiful people or beautiful things, they spread their tails, that is, they lift their tails, and declare imperiously that they are the most beautiful in the world!"
    "And then?"
    "Later, I plucked all the feathers off the peacock's tail. Because, it is said that the green color on the peacock's feathers is poisonous, called peacock green, right? — I’m not very clear on it, but anyway, that's what they say."
    "And now?"
    "Now I'm trying to stick pheasant feathers onto the peacock's tail. Because, it is said that a tail without feathers doesn't look like a peacock or a bird, it is said that someone criticized it, and it is said that pheasant feathers are the most beautiful feathers in the world, it is said…"
    "Have you ever studied and considered it from the peacock's point of view?"
    "From the peacock's point of view? Me, consider it myself? — How do you think I should consider it myself? Please give me your opinion frankly. I do have one advantage: I'm always willing to humbly accept other people's opinions, and I always have no reservations."

    据说……
    （寓言）
    “开头的时候，你让孔雀挨饿？”
    “我要饿得它翘不起尾巴来。因为，据说孔雀是骄傲自大的，遇到美丽的人美丽的东西时，它就开屏，也就是翘起尾巴来，不可一世地表示它才是天下最美丽的！”
    “后来呢？”
    “后来我把孔雀尾巴上的毛统统拔掉了。因为，据说孔雀毛上的绿色是有毒的，叫做孔雀绿吧？——我也搞不大清楚，反正据说是这样的。”
    “现在呢？”
    “现在我正在设法把野鸡毛插到孔雀的尾巴上去。因为，据说尾巴上没有毛就不像孔雀也不像鸟了，据说有人提出了批评，而且据说野鸡毛是天下最美丽的羽毛，据说……”
    “你自己可曾从孔雀出发研究考虑过吗？”
    “从孔雀出发吗？我自己来考虑吗？——你说我自己该怎样来考虑呢？请你不客气地给我提提意见吧，我这个人倒是有一个优点：一向肯于虚心接受别人的意见，而且总是没有什么保留的。”
