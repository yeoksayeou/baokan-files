Fully considering economic effectiveness is an important issue that must be paid attention to in the reconstruction and expansion of existing industrial enterprises.

At present, many factories and enterprises in coastal areas, based on the principle of "less investment, quick returns, and great effects," have assessed the potential strength of their enterprises and made designs and plans for reconstruction and expansion. Some enterprises have already completed their reconstruction and the results are very good. For example, the Tianjin Machine Tool Plant was originally a factory producing accessories such as boilers. After only seven months of reconstruction with little investment, it became a machine tool factory with a complete set of processes and capable of producing working machine tools. This approach saves national investment and improves production levels, which is in line with the long-term interests of socialist construction. Similar examples can be seen in various provinces and cities near the coast.

There are different opinions on the reconstruction issue in some enterprise units. For example, there are two opinions on the reconstruction of the Harbin Ball Bearing Factory. One opinion advocates renovating the weak links on the original basis, without large-scale reconstruction. Because the current annual output of this factory is 4.44 million sets, and it can reach 4.8 million sets if produced on a three-shift system by 1957. Based on the existing conditions, if 6 million yuan is invested to renovate the weak links on a small scale, 7 million sets can be achieved by 1958. According to another reconstruction plan, it is planned to spend 48.96 million yuan to rebuild the factory on the original site into a ball bearing factory with an annual output of 11.71 million sets. This would be equivalent to destroying an old factory with an annual output of nearly 5 million sets of bearings and rebuilding a new factory. This is very uneconomical. The other opinion believes that spending more than 48 million yuan to rebuild a factory with an annual output of 11.71 million sets of ball bearings is reasonable from the perspective of less investment and meeting needs as soon as possible. This discussion is very beneficial to the work.

However, some enterprise units do not pay much attention to calculating economic effectiveness when planning reconstruction. For example, the Shenyang Municipal State-owned Transformer Factory did not conduct a detailed survey of social needs, nor did it obtain formal approval from higher authorities. It started reconstruction only from the local perspective of the unit. After the factory is completed, the output in 1957 will be 69,000 kVA. According to research by relevant units, the maximum demand for transformers in Shenyang in 1957 from all aspects will not exceed 25,000 kVA. This would leave some production equipment idle, resulting in waste.

Of course, to fundamentally change the backward state of China's industry, it is necessary to build a number of large-scale, technologically advanced factories. Without such new factories as the backbone, it is impossible to advance industrial technology to an advanced level. However, considering the short-term economic effects, building a new factory requires a large investment and a long time. Utilizing old factories for appropriate reconstruction often requires much less investment and time than building a new factory. Although there are also old factories with too poor a foundation, making reconstruction less cost-effective than building a new one, there are many factories and enterprises in our country that are capable of being reconstructed. As long as we fully consider the foundation of the original factory, propose a reasonable product plan, and provide a small amount of investment, we can produce multiple times the products. If we do not utilize the available factory buildings and adopt the method of large-scale relocation, demolition, and movement for reconstruction, the investment will definitely increase, but the benefits will not be great. Especially during the reconstruction process, the loss of production or cessation of production due to relocation and installation will be considerable.

Some people say: From the perspective of short-term economic effectiveness, utilizing existing enterprises is more cost-effective than building a new factory; however, comparing costs, retaining old factories is not cost-effective. Facts have proved that this statement is incorrect. Because after the old factory is technically transformed, its costs will also be reduced, and the depreciation rate of most of the old factory buildings and equipment is much lower than that of new factories. Therefore, it is beneficial in terms of economic effectiveness and cost accounting to retain existing factory buildings and equipment as much as possible and to make full use of these facilities.

The biggest ideological obstacle in the current reconstruction and expansion of industrial enterprises is greed for quantity and scale, and a preference for the new and a dislike for the old. Some people look for various excuses to abandon old factories and build new ones, or demand that the reconstructed factory be exactly the same as a new factory. Some people only emphasize social needs and do not consider the source of materials and funds. Some factories blindly formulate reconstruction plans and then unscrupulously rush to purchase materials everywhere, causing a tight supply of materials. Therefore, when we formulate reconstruction and expansion plans, we must fully consider the economic effects under the principle of national planning and unified balance. Some factories seem reasonable from the local perspective of one unit, but may not be reasonable from the perspective of the needs of the entire national construction. Some factories are necessary to be reconstructed from the perspective of social needs, but do not have sufficient conditions from the perspective of financial, material, and human resources. As for factories that have the conditions for reconstruction and also need to be reconstructed, we must also pay attention to not demanding too much when formulating reconstruction plans. For all old equipment, everything that can be used should be used as much as possible, everything that can be saved should be saved as much as possible, and everything that can be postponed should be resolutely postponed.

The reconstruction and expansion of existing factories is a very complex task. It involves many aspects. In addition to fully considering the source of materials, product sales, production technology, and other conditions, we must also consider urban water supply, drainage, transportation, power supply, and base expansion. Due to historical reasons, the distribution of existing industrial enterprises in some cities is not entirely reasonable. There are also industries that seriously endanger the health and safety of residents, located in densely populated residential areas, and lack protective facilities. Many industrial enterprises are surrounded by dense buildings and have no room for development. There are also some factories far from transportation lines, making transportation very inconvenient. In these aspects, of course, should be studied and compared to avoid causing unreasonable phenomena. The Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory once planned to expand the original factory by one time, demolish 974 households, squeeze out 12 small factories, abolish 200 meters of urban roads and some other underground and ground engineering pipelines. Whether this approach is reasonable should be carefully considered. In order to prevent blindness in the reconstruction and expansion work, industrial enterprise departments should jointly study and make proper arrangements with the local urban construction departments and other relevant departments when considering the reconstruction of existing industrial enterprises.

Local factories and enterprises are currently arranging reconstruction and expansion plans for 1957. In order to make the plan realistic, we hope that the leaders of the enterprises and the relevant departments fully consider the economic effects, carefully decide on the reconstruction and expansion plans, and truly achieve less investment and greater effect.

### 充分考虑经济效果

    充分考虑经济效果
    充分考虑经济效果，是原有工业企业改建、扩建工作中必须注意的一个重要问题。
    目前近海地区的许多工厂企业根据“投资少、收效快、效果大”的原则，核算了企业的潜在力量，作出了改建、扩建的设计和计划。有些企业已经改建完成，效果很好。如天津机床厂原来是一个生产锅炉等产品的配件工厂，只经过七个月的改建，投资不多，就成为一个工序健全、生产工作母机的机床厂。这种做法，节约了国家投资，提高了生产水平，是符合社会主义建设长远利益的。类似这样的事例在近海各省、市都可以看到。
    有些企业单位在改建问题上是有不同意见的。如哈尔滨滚珠轴承厂的改建问题，就有两种意见。一种意见主张在原有基础上对薄弱环节进行改造，不必大规模改建。因为这个厂现在的年产量为四百四十四万套，按三班制生产，到1957年可达四百八十万套。根据现有条件，如果花六百万元投资，对薄弱环节进行小规模改建，到1958年即可达到七百万套。如果按另一种改建计划，即准备花四千八百九十六万元，在原有的厂址上改建成一个年产一千一百七十一万套的滚珠轴承厂。这就等于破坏一个将近年产五百万套轴承的旧厂，重建一个新厂。这是很不合算的。另一种意见认为：花四千八百多万元改建一个年产一千一百七十一万套滚珠轴承的工厂，从少投资而又尽快满足需要来看，还是合理的。这个讨论对于工作很有好处。
    但是，有些企业单位在计划改建的时候，还不大注意计算经济效果。例如，沈阳市地方国营变压器厂没有详细调查社会需要，也没有经过上级正式批准，只从本单位的局部观点出发，就动工改建。这个工厂建成后，1957年的产量将为六万九千千伏安。据有关单位研究，1957年各方面需要沈阳市的变压器，最多不超过两万五千千伏安。这就会使一部分生产设备闲置起来，造成浪费。
    当然，要从根本上改变我国工业的落后状态，必须建设一批规模较大、技术全新的工厂。没有这种新型的工厂做骨干，要把工业技术推进到先进水平是不可能的。但是，从近期的经济效果来考虑，建设一个新厂，需要花很大的投资和较长的时间。而利用老厂进行适当的改建，在投资上往往比建设新厂要少得多，时间也快得多。虽然也有一种老厂底子太差，改建还不如新建合算，但是，我国有很多工厂企业是具备了改建条件的，只要充分考虑原厂的基础，提出合理的产品方案，给以少量投资，就可以生产成倍的产品。如果我们对于可以利用的厂房不加利用，一律采取大搬、大拆、大动的办法去进行改建，投资就一定要增多，好处却不大。特别在改建过程中因为拆迁安装，造成降低生产或停止生产，损失将会不小。
    有人说：从近期的经济效果上着眼，利用原有企业比起新建一个厂子是会合算一些；然而，从成本上去比较，保留旧厂是不合算的。事实证明了这种说法是不对的。因为旧有工厂经过技术改造以后，它的成本同样也是要降低的，而且大部旧有厂房设备的折旧率也比新厂低得多。因此，尽可能保留原有厂房设备，并且充分利用这些设备，在经济效果和成本核算上都是有利的。
    当前工业企业的改建、扩建工作中最大的思想障碍是贪多贪大、喜新厌旧。有些人寻找各种借口废弃老厂、另建新厂，或者要求改建的工厂完全和新厂一样。有些人只强调社会需要，不考虑材料和资金来源。有的工厂盲目地编制了改建计划以后，不择手段地到处抢购材料，造成物资供应的紧张情况。因此，当我们在编制改建、扩建计划的时候，必须在全国规划、统一平衡的原则下，充分考虑经济效果。有些工厂从一个单位的局部观点来看好像是合理的，但从整个国家建设的需要来看未必是合理的。有些工厂从社会需要来说进行改建是必要的，但是，从财力、物力、人力来考虑却并不具备足够的条件。至于有条件改建也需要改建的工厂，在编制改建计划的时候，也要注意不能要求过高。对于一切旧有设备，凡是可以利用的应该尽量利用，凡是能节省的应该尽量节省，凡是可以推迟的就坚决推迟。
    原有工厂的改建、扩建是一件十分复杂的工作。它涉及的方面很多。除了材料来源、产品销售、生产技术等条件需要充分考虑以外，还要考虑城市供水、排水、交通运输、电力供应、基地扩展等条件。由于过去历史形成的原因，一些城市原有的工业企业的分布是不尽合理的。也有严重危害居民的健康和安全的工业，设在人口稠密的居民区内，而又缺乏防护设施。有很多工业企业周围建筑物密集，没有发展余地。还有一些工厂距离交通线很远，运输很不方便。在这些方面当然都应该进行研究和比较，极力避免造成不合理的现象。上海矿山机械厂曾经打算把原厂扩建一倍，拆除九百七十四家住户，挤掉十二家小工厂，废除二百公尺的城市道路以及其他一些地下和地上的工程管道等等。这种做法是否合理，就应该慎重考虑。为了防止改建和扩建工作中的盲目性，工业企业部门在考虑改建原有工业企业的时候，应该和当地城市建设部门及其他有关部门共同研究，进行妥善的安排。
    各地工厂企业现时正在安排1957年的改建和扩建计划。为了使计划切合实际，我们希望企业的领导人员和有关部门充分地考虑经济效果，慎重地决定改建和扩建计划，真正做到投资少而效果大。
