Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The Sino-Burmese Friendship Association held an evening party tonight to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the independence of the Union of Burma.

Zheng Zhenduo, President of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association, said at the meeting that January 4th, Burmese Independence Day, is invaluable to the Burmese people and a day worth commemorating for the Chinese people. He said that in the past, in the struggle against foreign aggression, we always supported each other, and our friendship was tested in adversity. Only after all countries have achieved independence and autonomy can our traditional friendship be further developed on a new basis.

Wu Ba Mao, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Burmese Embassy in China, spoke about the increasing development of friendship between China and Burma. He said that the mutual visits of the leaders of our two countries last year promoted the more friendly and close relationship between our two countries. He also mentioned the two gatherings of border people of China and Burma in Laukai and Mangshi last year. He said that these two gatherings laid an important cornerstone for Sino-Burmese friendship.

The evening party was presided over by Qian Weichang, Vice President of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association, who read out the congratulatory telegram from the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association to the Burmese-Chinese Friendship Association.

The documentary films "Burmese Film Delegation in Beijing" and "Burmese National Football Team Delegation in Beijing", and the stage art film "Song Shijie" were shown at the meeting.
