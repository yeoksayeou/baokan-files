    Readers Wu Yongyang, Liao Chengliang, Qi Yunfeng, and others wrote to point out numerous errors in the railway schematic diagram accompanying the news article "New Railway Five-Year Plan Completed Ahead of Schedule," published on the front page of this newspaper on December 8, 1956. For example, Laibin County in Guangxi Province was mistakenly drawn southwest of Nanning; Fengtai on the Beijing-Hankou Railway was mistakenly drawn on the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway; the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway (Nanxun Railway) was omitted; and the railway from Baichengzi to Changchun only extends to Guoqianqi, but the map incorrectly shows it as fully operational.

    The readers' opinions are correct. As the author of this schematic diagram, I accept the readers' criticism and am determined to strengthen data verification in the future, overcome a careless work style, and avoid making mistakes.

    决心克服粗枝大叶作风
    读者巫泳扬、廖承良、齐云峰等来信指出，1956年12月8日本报第一版刊登的“新建铁路五年计划提前完成”这一新闻所附的铁路示意图中有不少错误。如广西省的来宾县，被误画到南宁的西南方去了；京汉铁路上的丰台，被误画在京张铁路上；从南昌至九江的南浔铁路被遗漏了；从白城子到长春的铁路只通到郭前旗，地图上却错画成已全线通车等。
    读者的意见是正确的。作为这幅示意图的作者，我接受读者的批评，决心在今后加强资料核对工作，克服粗枝大叶作风，避免发生错误。
