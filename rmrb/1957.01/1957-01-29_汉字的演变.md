The evolution of Chinese characters, like everything else, is in constant motion and development. From the very first day that the earliest form of pictographic writing existed, it began its own history of metabolism. The four-thousand-year history of the evolution of Chinese characters is not only a history of one script replacing another, but also a history of certain structures replacing others, that is, the new replacing the old, the easy-to-write replacing the difficult-to-write, and the simple structure replacing the complex structure. The history of the evolution of Chinese characters illustrates that the process of developing from pictographic writing to simplified Chinese characters at the present stage is a complex process of continuous simplification and continuous complication. Chinese characters are a writing tool for recording the Chinese language, and this nature determines that it must develop in the direction of facilitating practical use, that is, in the direction of simplification; at the same time, Chinese characters are an auxiliary tool of the Chinese language, and this nature determines that it must develop along with the development of the Chinese language, that is, in the direction of complication. Simplification and complication are two opposing movements, and these two movements began with the emergence of Chinese characters and run through the entire process of its development. The continuous evolution of Chinese characters is the result of the contradictory development of these two movements.

The development of these two movements is unbalanced, and the roles they play are also different. In the interaction of these two movements, the nature of the script itself determines that simplification is in the mainstream position in any period of the development of Chinese characters.

The earliest form of Chinese characters, pictographic writing, developed from pictures. Pictographic writing is very close to pictures and can be said to be a kind of "iconic symbol." This symbol has a strong pictorial nature and is very inconvenient to write. For practical reasons, people simplified its strokes and structure:

	(1) Change pictographic symbols into linear symbols.
	Drawing pictographic writing of real objects takes a lot of time, so remove those parts that can be removed and replace the pictographic form with a linear form. For example: ?→?, ?→?.

	(2) Change filled strokes into linear strokes.
	Pictographic writing depicts real objects, so sometimes filled "fat strokes" are used, such as (?“集”) ? (combination of “亚” and “矣”), their main parts are filled. For the convenience of writing, they were later changed to ?? and ?, which are much easier to write.

This linear script simplified from pictographic writing is the so-called pictograph.

Although pictographs are simpler than pictographic writing, they are still a kind of written symbol that "draws what it represents." This feature determines that it is obviously impossible to create symbols using only the method of pictographs to meet the needs of recording language. This is because, first, not all real objects can be represented by pictographs, and second, those words that represent abstract concepts and function words that only have grammatical meaning but no lexical meaning cannot be represented by a pictographic symbol. In order to meet the needs of recording language, people have to borrow homophones or create another new symbol—semantic-phonetic characters.

The development from pictographs to semantic-phonetic characters is not only a process of complication, but also a process of simplification.

The emergence of semantic-phonetic characters is the result of the intensification and resolution of the contradiction between purely ideographic characters (square characters without phonetic components) and their burden of expressing spoken language. A semantic-phonetic character is a symbol with a phonetic component based on a purely ideographic character. It is composed of a semantic radical that indicates the category and a phonetic radical that indicates the pronunciation. Its emergence is, in fact, the beginning of Chinese characters breaking through the limitations of pictures and embarking on a new direction, that is, the direction of phonetic representation and the direction of simplification.

Early semantic-phonetic characters were relatively free in structure because they had not yet been finalized, and the semantic and phonetic radicals were not fixed. For example, "和" can be written as "咊" "?" "龢", and "狼" can be written as "?" "?". At the same time, the semantic and phonetic radicals did not have a fixed position. For the same character, the phonetic radical can be on the left, on the right, or above or below. For example, "驳" can be written as "?" "?", "讼" can be written as "?" "?", "攻" can be written as "?" "?" "?". These examples can fully illustrate some of the phenomena of complication before the square Chinese characters were finalized.

Later, Li Si standardized the writing system, and after the square characters underwent a large-scale simplification, the number decreased, and the structure of semantic-phonetic characters became more unified and fixed.

Complication and simplification are two interacting movements. In semantic-phonetic characters, some are formed by adding a phonetic radical to a purely ideographic character, and some are formed by adding a semantic radical to a borrowed purely ideographic character to express another word, creating the contradiction of homographs, homophones, and different meanings, and the contradiction between the original meaning and the borrowed meaning. The former, for example, "?" "?" (pictograph of "鸡") add the phonetic radical ? to become "?"; "?" (pictograph of "凤") add the phonetic radical "?" ("凡") to become "?". Because of the phonetic component, these originally complex semantic radicals were gradually simplified later (?→?) or replaced by another semantic radical with a simpler stroke and similar structure (?→?→?). The latter, for example, "须" (pictograph of "须") adds a semantic radical to become "须". Both adding a phonetic radical and adding a semantic radical are phenomena of complication. However, there are also very different aspects between the two. Adding a semantic radical is a simple complication, while the emergence of semantic-phonetic characters with phonetic radicals is, in fact, the result of the development of purely ideographic characters with more complex structures towards phonetic representation and simplification.

After the emergence of semantic-phonetic characters, they gained an absolute advantage. The vast majority of new characters created in later generations adopted the form of one semantic radical and one phonetic radical (even those that can be represented by pictographs adopted this form, such as "蟹" and "鰕"). This fact also reflects one aspect of simplification.

The "vulgar characters" and simplified characters that were rejected by the feudal ruling class gradually gained an absolute advantage from being rejected, which also reflects that simplification is the objective law of the development of Chinese characters over the past four thousand years.

The gradual simplification of square Chinese characters can also be seen from the evolution of the script. For example, "霍", the oracle bone script is written as "?", the bronze inscription is written as "?" "?", the small seal script is written as "?", and the clerical script and regular script are written as "霍". It can be seen that the simplification process from oracle bone script to bronze inscription, small seal script, clerical script, and regular script reflects the simplification trend of square Chinese characters and the process in which this trend has always gained an advantage.

After four thousand years of evolution, square Chinese characters have undergone many changes in shape. The original pictographs have all become symbols composed of strokes, and the original semantic-phonetic characters with phonetic components have also lost their phonetic function due to changes in pronunciation. Therefore, the square Chinese characters have now developed into individual symbols that mark Chinese words separately. Whether it is a purely ideographic character or a phonetic semantic-phonetic character, they are just some independent symbols that can only be recognized and memorized by rote.

More than 90% of the square characters currently in use are semantic-phonetic characters. The shortcomings of square Chinese characters that we are talking about mainly refer to the shortcomings of semantic-phonetic characters.

Since semantic-phonetic characters are produced on the basis of purely ideographic characters, when the shape and structure of these purely ideographic characters change, or the actual pronunciation of the language they represent changes, the semantic and phonetic radicals of the semantic-phonetic characters lose their function, and the so-called semantic-phonetic characters are just some square blocks that are not worthy of their name. From the perspective of the semantic radical, "?" becomes "犬" "犭", and "?" becomes "网" "罒". No one can distinguish its category in the shape of the character. From the perspective of the phonetic radical, because of the changes in pronunciation, the phonetic radical cannot represent the actual pronunciation. For example, the pronunciation of the characters derived from "也" ("它" "?" are the other two ways of writing "也") has twelve groups:

(1) ?衪袘 (same as "衪") 迆迱 (same as "迆") 迤 (same as "迆") 訑? (same as "訑") 酏匜椸灺貤? (same as "貤") 杝柂 (same as "杝") 灺蛇 (委蛇)
(2) ㄧ? 也釶鍦 (same as "釶")
(3) ㄒㄧ 忚
(4) ? 馳驰池竾弛胣
(5) ? 施絁
	?弛
(6) ?? 蛇虵 (vulgar character of "蛇") 鉈
(7) ㄉ? 地
(8) ㄊ?
(9) ㄊㄚ 它他她牠
(10) ㄊ? 怹
(11) ㄊ?? 牠他
(12) ㄊㄨ? 鮀紽佗柂
	ㄊㄨ? 驼駞 (same as "驼") 砣陀岮 (same as "陀")
	酡? (same as "酡") 鸵沱鼧柁坨 舵

It can be seen that, because of the changes in pronunciation, the characters with the same phonetic radical have a variety of pronunciations, and no one can find a system of pronunciation from the structure, that is to say, no one can know their pronunciation based on the phonetic radical.

The shortcomings in the structure of semantic-phonetic characters themselves also cause difficulties in learning and use. Its shortcomings are manifested in:

	(1) There is no difference in form from purely ideographic characters, such as "休" and "沐", "相" and "苜".

	(2) The position of the phonetic radical is not fixed. For example, in "期", "祺", "基", "衷", "苦", "闺", and "问", the position of the phonetic radical has seven types: left, right, top, middle, bottom, inside, and outside. The unfixed position of the phonetic radical makes learning difficult.

	(3) Two or more phonetic radicals are often used to represent the same pronunciation, such as "?" "蹟", "襟" "衿" "?". However, the same phonetic radical often represents two or more pronunciations, such as "澱" "臀", "洪" "供" "巷".

	(4) The position of the phonetic radical can be exchanged in some characters, for example, "够" can be written as "够", and "邻" can be written as "邻". But it is not possible in other characters. For example, "?" "裹" can be changed from the upper and lower combination form to the left and right combination form ("坪" "裡"), but some characters cannot, for example, 裹≠裸, 架≠枷. Whether it can be exchanged or not has no rule.

	(5) The semantic radical lacks logic and systematicity. For example, "狻", "狐", "猴", and "猪" are not the same kind of thing, but they all follow "犬". "猨", "蝯", and "猿" are the same thing, but they use two semantic radicals, "犬" and "虫". "蜼" is a long-tailed ape, but the semantic radical is "虫". "蛟" is a kind of dragon, "蝄蜽" is "the essence of mountains and rivers", and "蝙蝠" is a flying squirrel, but the semantic radicals are all "虫". Also, for example, "砲" is made of stone, "鰕" (shrimp) is a kind of fish, and "蝟" is a kind of insect. Everyone finds it strange.

	(6) The same character can have two or even more semantic radicals. For example, "炉" "鑪", "裙" "屌", "吟" "?" "訡", "袜" "?" "韤" "韈".

The above points out the shortcomings of semantic-phonetic characters from the structure. With the development of language and the borrowing of homophones, many semantic radicals have become things that cannot express the meaning category at all. It is difficult for anyone to figure out what the relationship between "笑" and "bamboo" is, and what the relationship between "校" (school) and "wood" is.

Square Chinese characters have developed to the present and have become holistic syllabic symbols. Each character has a structural form, and it is very difficult to learn and use. It has indeed reached the end of the road and must be changed!

Simplifying Chinese characters is the first step in "changing", but it can only alleviate some of the inconveniences in writing and save some writing time, and cannot solve the fundamental contradiction between Chinese characters and the Chinese language, that is, the contradiction between form, sound, and meaning. Only by thoroughly reforming it and thoroughly changing its fundamental nature, that is, from ideographic writing to phonetic writing, can the fundamental contradiction between Chinese characters and the Chinese language be solved.

Those who oppose the reform of Chinese characters only see that Chinese characters have remained at the semantic-phonetic character stage for thousands of years, and they deny the possibility of Chinese characters developing into phonetic writing. They not only ignore that a hypothetical writing symbol system can be boldly replaced with another, but also do not notice that square Chinese characters themselves have their own inevitable movement of phonetic representation. Many materials in the history of the development of square Chinese characters show that Chinese characters have been developing in the direction of phonetic representation since the day they began to exist, such as the borrowing of homophones, the emergence of semantic-phonetic characters, the transformation of non-phonetic characters ("焱" transformed into "焰", "羴" transformed into "羶", "姦" transformed into "奸", etc.), and the phoneticization of semantic radicals (referring to the conversion of the original semantic radical into a phonetic radical. Most of the radicals of semantic-phonetic characters now have both semantic and phonetic uses. Only a few characters such as "廴", "辶", and "艸" can only be used as semantic radicals), and so on.

There is no language in the world that cannot use phonetic writing. Since replacing non-phonetic characters with phonetic characters is a progressive trend, then replacing semantic-phonetic characters that have completely lost their phonetic function with phonetic writing is not only more progressive, but also completely possible.

    汉字的演变
    梁东汉
    汉字也和其他事物一样，它是不断地运动着和发展着的。从最早的形式图画文字存在的那一天起，它就开始了它自己的新陈代谢的历史。汉字四千年演变的历史不但是一种字体代替了另一种字体的历史，而且也是某些结构代替了另一些结构的历史，亦即新的代替了旧的，易写的代替了难写的，结构简单的代替了结构复杂的历史。汉字演变的历史说明了，从图画文字发展到现阶段简化汉字的过程就是一个不断简化不断繁化的错综复杂的过程。汉字是记录汉语的书写工具，这个性质就决定了它必然朝着便于实用的方向发展，即朝着简化的方向发展；同时，汉字又是汉语的辅助工具，这个性质又决定了它必然跟着汉语的发展而发展，即朝着繁化的方向发展。简化繁化是两种相反的运动，这两种运动是跟随着汉字的出现而开始并且贯彻在它发展的整个过程中的，汉字的不断演变就是这两种运动的矛盾发展的结果。
    这两种运动的发展是不平衡的，所起的作用也不同。在这两种运动的交互作用中，文字本身的性质决定了简化在汉字发展的任何时期都处于主流的地位。
    汉字的最早形式图画文字是从图画发展来的。图画文字和图画很接近，可以说是一种“形象化的符号”，这种符号图画性很强，写起来很不方便。为了实用的理由，人们就把它的笔画和结构加以简化：
    （1）把图画式的符号改成线条式的符号。
    描绘实物的图画文字写起来很费时间，于是就减去那些可以减去的部分，用线条的形式代替图画的形式。例如：?→?，?→?。
    （2）把填实的笔画改成线条式的笔画。
    图画文字是描绘实物的，因此有时就用填实的“肥笔”，例如（?“集”）?（“亚”“矣”合文），它们的主要部分都是填实的。为了书写的方便，后来就改成??和?写起来就容易得多了。
    这种由图画文字简化而成的线条式的文字就是所谓象形字。
    象形字虽然比图画文字简单了些，但是它依然是“画成其物”的一种书写符号，这个特点就决定了光用象形这个办法创造符号来满足记录语言的需要显然是不可能的，因为一则不是所有的实物都可以象形，二则那些代表抽象概念的词和只有语法意义而没有词汇意义的虚词也不能创制一个象形的符号来代表它。为了满足记录语言的需要，人们就不得不借用同音字或者创造另外一种新符号——形声字。
    从象形字发展到形声字，它不但是一个繁化的过程，同时也是一个简化的过程。
    形声字的出现是纯粹表意字（没有标音成分的方块字）和它所担负的表达有声语言的矛盾的激化和解决的结果。形声字是以纯粹表意字为基础的一种有标音成分的符号，它是由一个表示类属的形符和一个表示语音的声符所组成的。它的出现，事实上就是汉字冲破图画的限制，走上一个新的方向即表音的方向，简化的方向的开始。
    早期的形声字，因为还没有定型化，结构是比较自由的，形符和声符并不固定。例如，“和”可以写成“咊”“?”“龢”，“狼”可以写成“?”“?”。同时，形符和声符也没有一定的位置，同一个字，声符可以在左，可以在右，也可以在上面或下面。例如，“驳”可以写成“?”“?”，“讼”可以写成“?”“?”，“攻”可以写成“?”“?”“?”。这些例子都可以充分说明方块汉字在没有定型化以前繁化的一些现象。
    后来李斯整齐划一文字，方块字经历了一次大规模的简化以后，数量减少了，形声字的结构也比较统一起来，固定下来。
    繁化和简化是交互作用的两种运动。形声字里，有一部分是由纯粹表意字加注声符而成的，也有一部分是由于某一个纯粹表意字被借来表达另外一个词，造成同形、同音、异义的矛盾，本义和借义的矛盾，因而在被借字上加注形符而成的。前者例如，“?”“?”（“鸡”的象形字）标注声符?变成“?”；“?”（“凤”的象形字）标注声符“?”（“凡”）变成“?”。因为有了标音的成分，这些原来笔画繁复的形符后来就逐渐简化（?→?）或者被另外一个笔画比较简单、结构相近的形符所替代（?→?→?）。后者例如“须”（“须”的象形字）加注形符变成“须”。无论是标注声符或者加注形符都是繁化的现象。可是二者也有很不相同的地方，加注形符是单纯的繁化，而标注声符的形声字的出现事实上就是结构比较繁复的纯粹表意字向表音及简化的方向发展的结果。
    形声字出现以后就取得了绝对的优势，后世创造的新字绝大多数都采取一形一声的形式（即使是可以象形的也采取这种形式，例如“蟹”“鰕”），这个事实也反映了简化的一个方面。
    被封建统治阶级所排斥的“俗字”、简字，由被排斥而逐渐取得绝对优势，也反映了简化是四千年来汉字发展的客观规律。
    从字体的演变也可以看出方块汉字逐渐简化的过程。例如“霍”，甲骨文写成“?”金文写成“?”“?”，小篆写成“?”隶书、楷书写成“霍”。由此可见，由甲骨文发展成为金文、小篆、隶书、楷书的简化过程正反映了方块汉字的简化趋向以及这个趋向始终取得优势的过程。
    方块汉字经过四千年的演变，在形体上有过多次变迁，原来的象形字都变成了用点画组成的符号，而原来有标音成分的形声字也因为语音的变化失去了它的标音的作用。因此，方块汉字发展到现在已经成为一个个分别标记汉语的词的符号，无论是纯粹表意字或者是标音的形声字都只是一些独立的、只能死认死记的符号。
    现在使用的方块字有90％以上是形声字，我们所说的方块汉字的缺点主要是指形声字的缺点。
    形声字既然是在纯粹表意字的基础上产生的，那末，当这些纯粹表意字的形体和结构发生变化，或者它所代表的语言的实际读音起了变化时，形声字的形符和声符就失去作用，所谓形声字也只是一些名不符实的方块块。从形符说，“?”变成“犬”“犭”，“?”变成“网”“罒”，谁也不能在字形上分辨它的类属。从声符说，因为语音的变迁，声符也不能表示实际的读音，例如从“也”（“它”“?”是“也”的另外两种写法）得声的字的读音就有十二组：
    （1）?衪袘（同“衪”）迆迱（同“迆”）迤（同“迆”）訑?（同“訑”）酏匜椸灺貤?（同“貤”）杝柂（同“杝”）灺蛇（委蛇）
    （2）ㄧ?也釶鍦（同“釶”）
    （3）ㄒㄧ忚
    （4）?馳驰池竾弛胣
    （5）?施絁
         ?弛
    （6）??蛇虵（“蛇”俗字）鉈
    （7）ㄉ?地
    （8）ㄊ?
    （9）ㄊㄚ它他她牠
    （10）ㄊ? 怹
    （11）ㄊ??牠他
    （12）ㄊㄨ?鮀紽佗柂
     ㄊㄨ?驼駞（同“驼”）砣陀岮（同“陀”）
    酡?（同“酡”）鸵沱鼧柁坨　舵
    由此可见，因为语音的变迁，同一个声符的字是有多种多样读法的，任何人都不能够从结构上找出一个读音的系统来，也就是说，任何人都不能够根据声符知道它们的读音。
    形声字本身构造上的缺点也造成学习和使用的困难，它的缺点表现在：
    （一）在形式上和纯粹表意字没有区别，例如“休”和“沐”，“相”和“苜”。
    （二）声符的位置没有一定，例如“期”“祺”“基”“衷”“苦”“闺”“问”，声符的位置有左、右、上、中、下、内、外七种。声符的位置不固定，学习起来就困难。
    （三）表示同一个读音往往使用两个以上的声符，例如“?”“蹟”，“襟”“衿”“?”。可是同一个声符又往往代表两种以上的读音，例如，“澱”“臀”，“洪”“供”“巷”。
    （四）声符的位置在某些字里可以交换，例如“够”可以写成“够”，“邻”可以写成“邻”。但是在另一些字里就不能。又如“?”“裹”可以由上下组合的形式变为左右组合的形式（“坪”“裡”），但有些字就不能，例如裹≠裸，架≠枷。能不能交换，毫无规律。
    （五）形符缺乏逻辑性和系统性。例如，“狻”“狐”“猴”“猪”不是一类东西，但都从“犬”。“猨”“蝯”“猿”是一个东西，但用“犬”“虫”两种形符。“蜼”是长尾猿，但形符是“虫”。“蛟”是龙的一种，“蝄蜽”是“山川之精物”，“蝙蝠”是飞鼠，但形符也都是“虫”。又如“砲”用石造，“鰕”（虾）是鱼类，“蝟”是虫类，谁听了都觉得奇怪。
    （六）同一个字，形符可以有两种甚至两种以上。例如“炉”“鑪”，“裙”“屌”，“吟”“?”“訡”，“袜”“?”“韤”“韈”。
    以上是从结构上指出形声字的缺点。随着语言的发展，同音字的借用，许多形符都变成了完全不能表示意义范畴的东西，任何人都很难想通“笑”和“竹子”有什么关系，“校”（学校）和“木头”有什么关系。
    方块汉字发展到现在已经成为一个个囫囵的音节符号，一个字有一个字的结构形式，学习和使用起来都很困难，确实到了山穷水尽，非变不可的地步！
    简化汉字是“变”的第一步，但它只能减轻书写上某些不便，节省一些书写时间，并不能解决汉字和汉语的根本矛盾，即形音义的矛盾。只有彻底加以改革，彻底改变它的根本性质，即从表意文字改变为拼音文字，汉字和汉语的根本矛盾才能够得到解决。
    反对汉字改革的人只看到汉字几千年来停留在形声字阶段，就否定汉字发展成为拼音文字的可能。他们不但忽略了一个假设的书写符号体系是可以大胆地用另一种来替换的，而且也没有注意到方块汉字本身有它自己表音的必然的运动。方块汉字发展史的许多材料都说明了，汉字从它开始存在的那一天起就朝着表音的方向发展，例如同音字的借用，形声字的出现，不标音字的转化（“焱”转化为“焰”，“羴”转化为“羶”，“姦”转化为“奸”，等等），形符的声符化（指原来当作形符用的转化为声符。现在大部分形声字的偏旁都兼有形符声符两种用途，仅仅有少数字如“廴”“辶”“艸”等只能当形符用），等等。
    世界上没有那一种语言不能采用拼音文字。既然用标音字代替不标音字是一种进步的趋势，那末，用拼音文字更换完全失去标音作用的形声字，不但是更进步的，而且是完全可能的。
