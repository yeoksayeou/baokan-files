Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, January 15th: The Baicheng Farm Implement Factory in Jilin Province has successfully trial-produced a new-style Type 55 windmill.

　　Under wind speeds of four meters per second, this windmill can lift water from a depth of 4.5 meters, driving a Liberation-style waterwheel with a 30-inch diameter pipe. The water lifting capacity is significantly higher than that of a horse-drawn waterwheel.

　　This windmill is modeled after the Type 55 windmill from the Jinzhou Agricultural Experiment Station, with some modifications made based on local conditions. Its structure is simple, consisting of only three parts: the wind rotor, transmission equipment, and tower. Except for the wind rotor and transmission equipment, which need to be manufactured by a factory, the tower can be built by the agricultural production cooperative using local materials. When using this windmill, only one water distributor who knows the wind direction is needed to align the windmill with the wind direction, and to look after the windmill while watching the waterwheel.

　　The Baicheng area is known for being drought-prone, suffering from wind, sand, drought, and other natural disasters year after year. Since the realization of cooperativization in the entire area, agricultural production cooperatives are vigorously carrying out a well-digging and drought-prevention campaign. This type of wind-powered windmill is very suitable for farmers to dig wells for irrigation.

    新式风车
    新华社长春15日电　吉林省白城农具厂试制成功新式五五型风车。
    这种风车在风速每秒四公尺的情况下，可以在井深四点五公尺，带动管径三十寸的解放式水车提水。提水量比马拉水车高出很多。
    这种风车是仿照锦州农业试验站的五五型风车，依据当地情况作了部分修改制造成功的。它的构造简单，仅有风轮、传动设备、塔架三个部分。除风轮、传动设备需由工厂制造以外，塔架可以由农业生产合作社自己就地取材和制造。使用这种风车的时候，只要有一个懂得风向的配水员把风车对准风向，在看管水车的同时照看一下风车就行了。
    白城地区以十年九旱著名，常年遭受风砂干旱等自然灾害的威胁。在全区实现合作化以后，农业生产合作社正大力开展打井防旱运动，这种利用风力发动的风车很适于农民打井浇地用。
