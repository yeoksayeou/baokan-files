When Can the Anle Rayon Factory Produce?
By our Shanghai correspondent

    On August 19, 1956, the People's Daily published a Xinhua News Agency dispatch on page two, stating that the Shanghai Anle Rayon Factory was already capable of manufacturing rayon, artificial wool, artificial cotton, and high-tenacity rayon for the defense industry needed by the textile industry. The message said:
  “Since its preparation began in 1936, the Anle Joint State-Private Rayon Factory has hired experts from countries such as France and Germany to guide trial production. However, it had not been put into production for more than a decade. It was not until after liberation that an experimental workshop was officially opened, and Chinese engineers led the manufacturing of rayon."
    To the average reader, this is such an exciting thing! Unfortunately, this news only reflects one aspect of the matter, and not the important one. Behind this news, there is also a heartbreaking tragedy: the factory did not successfully produce China's first batch of rayon last August, but as early as 1951. However, this factory, which made preliminary contributions to China's rayon industry, has encountered misfortune since then. Due to some technical reasons, it has been delayed for nearly six years without production. Until now, the factory is still basically in a state of shutdown.
    The intention here is not to criticize the one-sidedness of this news, but to supplement it and take this opportunity to appeal for the unfortunate situation of the Anle Rayon Factory!
    We all know that the rayon industry is still a blank spot in our country that urgently needs to be filled. Old China left only two factories: one that produces short rayon fibers (i.e., artificial wool, etc.), which is in Andong, and has been severely damaged and is now being restored. The other is the Anle Rayon Factory in Shanghai, which is the only factory in the country that can produce long rayon fibers (i.e., rayon). This factory was established by private capital before liberation. It has never officially started operations. The scale of the factory is relatively small, with a daily output of only one and a half tons of rayon, but the equipment and factory buildings are very complete, and the machines are relatively new. It can be said that it is the first bud of China's rayon industry and is very worthy of cherishing. It is precisely for this reason that in 1950, after consultation with capitalists, the Ministry of Textile Industry implemented a joint state-private partnership in the factory and conducted trial production of rayon in early 1951. The trial production went very well. This batch of rayon and some rayon fabrics woven from it were publicly displayed at exhibitions at home and abroad. In the same year, the Ministry of Textile Industry invested 3 million yuan and decided to fully resume production, taking this factory as a base for researching technology, cultivating talents, and further developing the rayon industry.
    However, this factory has a fatal flaw: its factory buildings are located in a residential area in Shanghai, and rayon factories are a somewhat dangerous industry. In the production process, it emits a harmful waste gas—hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide. If this gas is not controlled by scientific methods, it will cause air poisoning, explosions, and combustion when it reaches a certain concentration. Therefore, when the factory applied for expanding production, the Shanghai Municipal Construction Committee (now the Shanghai Municipal Planning and Construction Administration), the Municipal Health Bureau, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau Fire Department all disagreed. They wanted the factory to move to a dangerous industrial zone. However, the textile industry department believed that harmful gases could be resolved through technical measures, and abandoning the original foundation would be wasteful and delay the time.
    It is not surprising that the two sides have different opinions, which is precisely the manifestation of people being responsible for their work. However, it is very regrettable that in the case of the Anle factory, some departments did not adopt this attitude and take normal measures to resolve this disagreement, which caused the factory to be delayed until today, and there is still no solution, wasting several years of valuable construction time.
    The plan proposed by the Shanghai urban planning and other departments to move the factory to a dangerous industrial zone in the suburbs has the advantage of not only eliminating the threat of harmful gases but also allowing the factory to have room for future development. In 1952, after consulting with higher-level authorities, the relevant departments in Shanghai finalized this plan. If this plan had been implemented, the Anle factory would have been in normal production today. But unfortunately, this plan was not implemented. Initially, the textile department accepted this plan. The Anle factory started designing in 1953, preparing to move to the dangerous industrial zone designated by the Shanghai Municipal Construction Committee. When the work was halfway through, the Municipal Construction Committee informed them to suspend the work because the overall plan of Shanghai city had changed, and asked the factory to move to another dangerous industrial zone. Soon after, the Anle factory prepared to move the factory twice, but both failed. After several twists and turns, the textile department was unwilling to move the factory anymore, believing that moving the factory was not cost-effective because realizing this plan required a considerable investment, and it would basically require construction from scratch, which would take longer than restoring production at the original site. As a result, things were repeatedly delayed.
    The plan proposed by the textile department to take technical measures to solve harmful gases and carry out production at the original site may be more technically difficult, but it is not completely unfeasible. In 1953, two Soviet dyeing and printing experts suggested that harmful gases could be resolved through technical measures such as ventilation. In April 1956, after visiting the factory, Wilhelm, a rayon expert from East Germany, put forward a specific suggestion, believing that as long as a 70-meter-high chimney was built, the waste gas would be discharged to the higher air layer through the chimney, immediately becoming diluted and would not have any impact on people. The technical staff of the Anle factory also conducted many experiments in the factory, believing that the waste gas could be controlled. Based on the opinions of experts and the results of experiments, the textile department repeatedly proposed a plan to resume work at the original site. In 1956, it also proposed a plan to use the factory as a rayon experimental factory for small-scale experimental production. However, the Shanghai Health and Urban Planning and Construction departments still disagreed, because those technical measures were not 100% guaranteed after all. Who knows if other accidents will occur, and these measures are quite troublesome! So this plan was also shelved.
    For several years, the two plans have been repeatedly discussed, stopping and talking, talking and stopping. I don’t know how many meetings have been held and how many documents have been issued, but no results have been reached.
    Since these two plans are deadlocked, if a leading organization came out to seriously intervene in this matter, weighed the pros and cons of the two plans, and made a decision, the stalemate could be resolved, and the cause could move forward. But unfortunately, things did not develop in this direction. The staff of the Anle Rayon Factory have written letters to the leading organs of Shanghai Municipality several times to appeal. In the past few years, many leading staff members from the State Planning Commission and other leading departments have also visited the Anle Rayon Factory. Some of them have also held symposiums with the relevant personnel in the factory and talked. They praised the Anle factory's equipment as good and should be restored to production, expressing sympathy and regret for the long-term freezing of the factory. However, the situation of the Anle Rayon Factory has not changed at all.
    Perhaps some people will say: "The Anle factory has been delayed for several years without resuming work, and we cannot be blamed for it alone. The solution to the harmful gas problem is indeed very complicated, and we have no experience." Yes, the rayon industry is still a new thing in our country. We really don't have and cannot have experience, and the technology to solve the harmful gas problem is indeed more complicated. However, where do we get experience from? Is it to gradually seek and accumulate experience in active practice? Or do we just stop here and not move forward? For more than six years, our country has built many new factories and mines with extremely complex technologies, and the difficulties they have encountered are more than ten thousand. Is there not one of these difficulties that can withstand the exhaust gas problem of the Anle factory? Is it only the exhaust gas problem that our wisdom cannot overcome?
    In the past few years, the staff of the Anle factory have been looking forward to the resumption of the factory day and night. Whether it is resuming work on the spot or building a new factory, they are willing. Their only hope is to not let them keep their hands idle for a long time, longing to serve the country, and to develop the emerging rayon industry in the motherland. In 1955, the technicians used a small part of the factory buildings to carry out the first trial production of high-tenacity rayon in China and achieved success. This high-tenacity rayon is of good quality and can be used as an important raw material for truck tires, aircraft tires, and parachutes. This fact once again shows that if the equipment and technical strength of the Anle factory are well utilized, contributions can be made to the rayon industry. However, the hopes of the staff of the Anle factory have been dashed again and again, and the painful losses are continuing. In the past few years, the textile industry department has been suffering from the lack of a place to train technical backbone forces for the large new rayon factory that is being prepared for construction, and the students of the rayon fiber department of the East China Textile Institute in Shanghai have been suffering from the lack of a place to practice (they have to go to general chemical factories). When everyone is trying to find and cannot find a rayon factory, the workers and technicians of the Anle factory sigh at the machines, suffering from being useless.
    Recently, Ding Yongnian, a staff member of the Anle factory, wrote another letter to the People's Daily, saying: "After visiting the rayon fabrics at the Japanese commodity exhibition, I was very excited. Is it that we can't make this kind of rayon? No, we can do it. Is it that we don't have equipment? No, our whole set of machines is sleeping in the workshop. Is it that we don't have technicians? Although we don't have many, we have a few. It's just that the staff of our Anle factory are "living and working in peace and contentment" like our factory name. However, editor, we don't want such "peace and contentment." We want to work vigorously like other construction departments. We urgently hope that the chimney of the Anle factory will emit smoke as soon as possible."
    This is not the first time that the staff of the Anle factory has made such an appeal. Those who are responsible for this matter have an obligation to answer their question as soon as possible: When will the chimney of the Anle Rayon Factory emit smoke?

    安乐人造丝厂什么时候能生产？
    本报驻上海记者
    1956年8月19日人民日报二版上，登了一条新华社发的消息，内容是说：上海安乐人造丝厂已经能够制造纺织工业需要的人造丝、人造毛、人造棉以及国防工业用的强力人造丝了。消息说：
  “公私合营安乐人造丝厂自从1936年开始筹建以来，曾聘请法、德等国的专家指导试制，十多年始终没有投入生产。直到解放以后，才正式开辟实验工场，由中国工程师领导制造人造丝。”
    在一般读者看来，这是一件多么振奋人心的事情！但不幸得很，这条消息所反映的，只不过是事情的一面，而且不是重要的一面。在这条新闻的背后，还有着一个令人痛心的悲剧：原来这个工厂不是在去年8月间，而是早在1951年就试制成功了我国第一批人造丝。但是，这座为我国人造纤维工业作出了初步贡献的工厂从那时起就遭遇了不幸。由于一些技术上的原因，已整整被延搁了将近六年没有进行生产，直到现在这座工厂依然基本上处在停工状态中。
    这里不是想批评这条消息的片面性，而是想对这条消息作一个补充，利用这个机会，为安乐人造丝厂的不幸的遭遇作一番呼吁！
    我们都知道，人造纤维工业现在在我国还是一个急待充实的空白点。旧中国留下来的只有两个厂：一个是制造短人造纤维（即人造毛等）的工厂，它在安东，已经被严重破坏，现在正在着手恢复。另一个就是上海的安乐人造丝厂，它是全国唯一能生产长人造纤维（即人造丝）的工厂。这座工厂是在解放前由私人资本建立的，过去没有正式开过工，厂的规模比较小，每天只能生产一吨半人造丝，但设备、厂房等很完整，机器也比较新颖。可以说它是我国人造丝工业的第一颗幼芽，是很值得珍视的。正是由于这个原因，1950年纺织工业部在跟资本家协商之后，在厂实行了公私合营，并在1951年初进行了人造丝的试制。这次试制的情况很好，这批人造丝和织成的一些人造丝织品曾拿到国内外展览会上公开展出。纺织工业部在同年便投资三百万元，决定全部恢复生产，把这个厂作为研究技术、培养人才、进一步发展人造纤维工业的一个基点。
    但是这个工厂有一个致命的缺陷：它的厂房设置在上海市区的住宅区里，而人造丝厂是属于有一定危险性的工业，它在生产过程中要排出一种有害的废气——硫化氢和二硫化炭，这种气体如果不用科学方法加以控制，在达到一定浓度之后，就会发生毒化空气、爆炸燃烧等恶果。因此当工厂提出要扩大生产的申请之后，上海市政建设委员会（即现在的上海市规划建筑管理局）和市卫生局、市公安局消防处都不同意，他们要工厂迁移到危险工业区去。而纺织工业部门认为有害气体可以采取技术措施来解决，抛弃原有基础既浪费，也拖延时日。
    双方意见不同，这是毫不足怪的，这正是人们对事业负责的表现。但是非常遗憾，在安乐厂的问题上，有些部门却没有本着这种态度，采取正常的办法来解决这种分歧，以致使工厂拖延到今天，仍然没有一个方案，浪费了几年的大好建设时光。
    上海城市规划等部门提出的迁厂到郊区危险工业区去的方案，优点是既可解除有害气体的威胁，也可以使日后工厂有发展的余地。1952年，上海有关部门在请示上级机关以后，就确定了这个方案。如果执行了这个方案，那么安乐厂今天早就在正常地进行生产了。但可惜，这个方案没有被执行。最初纺织部门是接受了这个方案的，安乐厂在1953年时已动手设计，准备迁厂到上海市政建设委员会指定的危险工业区去。工作进行到一半，市政建设委员会因为上海城市的总体规划有了变更，通知他们中止了工作，要工厂迁到另一个危险工业区去。不久，安乐厂还曾两度准备迁厂，但均未成功。几经周折之后，纺织部门不愿再迁厂了，认为迁厂不合算，因为要实现这个方案，需要一笔不小的投资，而且基本上要从头建设，时间要比在原址恢复生产慢。以致一再蹉跎，把事情拖了下来。
    纺织部门提出的采取技术措施解决有害气体，在原址进行生产的方案，在技术上可能比较困难些，但也不是完全行不通的。1953年苏联两位印染专家曾提出有害气体可以采取通风换气等技术措施来解决。1956年4月，民主德国人造丝专家威尔克等人参观了该厂以后，更提出了一个具体建议，认为只要修建一个七十公尺高的烟囱，废气经过烟囱排至较高的空气层，立即变得稀薄，就不会对人有什么影响。安乐厂的技术人员在厂内也进行了多次试验，认为废气是可以控制的。纺织部门根据专家的意见和试验结果，几次提出了在原址复工的方案，1956年还提出了将工厂作为人造丝实验厂，进行小规模试验性生产的方案。但是上海卫生和城市规划建筑部门仍不同意，因为那些技术措施毕竟不是百分之百能够打包票的，谁知道会不会发生其他意外，而且这些措施还相当麻烦！于是这个方案也搁浅了。
    几年来，就在这两个方案之间，反反复复地讨论，停停谈谈，谈谈停停，不知开了多少次会，发了多少文电，还是没有谈出结果来。
    既然这两个方案相持不下，如果有一个领导机关出来认真干预一下这件事，衡量两个方案的利弊，作出一个决定，僵局是可以解决的，事业是可以前进的。但是不幸得很，事情没有朝着这个方向发展。安乐人造丝厂的工作人员曾经数次写信给上海市领导机关呼吁。几年来，国家计划委员会等领导部门，也有不少领导工作人员到过安乐人造丝厂参观访问，其中有的人还同厂里的有关人员开了座谈会，谈了话，他们赞扬安乐厂的设备不错，应当恢复生产，对工厂长期被冻结表示同情、惋惜。然而安乐人造丝厂的情况，现在仍无丝毫改变。
    也许有人会说：“安乐厂拖了几年不复工，不能只怪我们。有害气体问题的解决确实很复杂，我们没有经验呵。”是的，人造丝工业在我国还是一个新事物，我们确实没有、也不可能有经验，解决有害气体问题，技术上也确实比较复杂。但是，我们从那里去取得经验呢？是在积极的实践中去逐步寻求和积累经验呢？还是就此停步不进呢？六年多了，我国已建成了许多技术上极为复杂的新厂矿，它们所遇到的困难何止万千，难道这些困难中没有一个抵得过安乐厂的废气问题？难道独独只有废气问题是我们的智慧所不能战胜的？
    这几年中，安乐厂的工作人员日夜想望着工厂复工，不论是在原地复工，还是迁厂新建，他们都乐意。他们唯一的希望就是不要再让他们长期地把一双渴望为国家效劳的手空闲起来，就是让祖国新兴的人造丝工业得到发展。1955年，技术人员们利用了小部分厂房，进行了国内第一次强力人造丝的试制，获得了成功。这种强力人造丝质量很好，可以作为卡车轮胎、飞机轮胎、降落伞的重要原料。这个事实，再次说明了如果好好利用安乐厂的设备和技术力量，是可以在人造纤维工业方面作出贡献来的。但是，安乐厂工作人员们的希望一次又一次的落空了，令人痛心的损失在继续着。几年来，纺织工业部门苦于没处给正在筹建中的大型的新人造丝工厂培养技术骨干力量，上海的华东纺织学院人造纤维系的学生苦于没处实习（只好到一般的化工厂去），而正在大家想找而找不到人造纤维厂的时候，安乐厂的工人和技术人员们却朝着机器叹气，苦于英雄无用武之地。
    最近，安乐厂的一位工作人员丁永年又给人民日报写了一封信，他说：“在参观了日本商品展览会上的人造丝织品以后，心情非常激动，是不是这种人造丝我们不会做呢？不，我们能够做。是不是我们没有设备呢？不，我们的整套机器在车间里睡觉。是不是我们没有技术人员呢？我们虽然不多，但也有几个。只是我们安乐厂的工作人员像我们的厂名一样在“安居乐业”。可是，编辑同志，我们不要这样的“安乐”，我们要同其他建设部门一样轰轰烈烈地工作，我们迫切地希望安乐厂的烟囱早日冒烟。”
    安乐厂的工作人员提出这样的呼吁，已经不是第一次了。对这件事情负有责任的人们有义务早日答复他们这个质问：安乐人造丝厂的烟囱究竟何时冒烟？
