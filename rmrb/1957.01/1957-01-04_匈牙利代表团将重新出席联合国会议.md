Xinhua News Agency, January 2nd dispatch from Budapest: "People's Freedom" recently published a conversation with Hungarian Foreign Minister Imre Horvath. Horvath said that the Hungarian delegation will return to its seat at the United Nations meetings at the beginning of January. The delegation will be led by First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, An. Sik.

Regarding the question of the United Nations Secretary-General visiting Hungary, Horvath stated that Hammarskjöld had agreed that his previously decided visit to Budapest could not promote the normalization of the situation in Hungary, nor was it in the interests of the Hungarian people, because counter-revolutionaries were preparing to launch new armed attacks on the day of his visit to Budapest.

    匈牙利代表团将重新出席联合国会议
    据新华社2日讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：“人民自由报”最近发表了匈牙利外交部长伊姆雷·霍瓦特的谈话。霍瓦特说，匈牙利代表团将在1月初重新回到联合国的会议席上。代表团将由外交部第一副部长安·西克率领。
    谈到联合国秘书长到匈牙利作访问的问题时，霍瓦特声明说，哈马舍尔德已经同意，他以前决定的到布达佩斯的访问不能促进匈牙利情况的正常化，也不符合匈牙利人民的利益，因为反革命分子准备在他到布达佩斯访问的那天发动新的武装进攻。
