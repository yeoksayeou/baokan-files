    Yongdingzhuang Miners Sweep Up "Loose Coal"
    (Our dispatch) In the first ten days or so of January, the workers of the Yongdingzhuang Mine of Datong Coal Mine increased coal production by 600 tons just by sweeping up "loose coal."
    When coal is mined, workers use shovels to scoop the coal onto the electric chutes that transport the coal. Many chunks of coal and coal dust are scattered on both sides and at the bottom of the electric chutes, and a low coal wall, like a ridge in a field, accumulates beneath the chutes. This is "loose coal." In the past, people did not pay attention to "loose coal," believing that it accounted for only a small amount compared to the quantity of coal produced, so it was all left in the mine.
    At the beginning of January, the Yongdingzhuang Mine held a staff meeting to mobilize for increased production and thrift. When the Party Secretary and the Mine Director calculated the figures, they pointed out that the amount of "loose coal" underground was very large. The "loose coal" discarded by the entire mine every day was equivalent to the daily coal production of a small working face.
    The workers were surprised and expressed their determination to close this loophole of waste. The leader of the No. 6 mining section took the lead in sweeping "loose coal," collecting 145 tons of "loose coal" in the seven days from January 8th. The workers of the No. 17 well swept up 180 tons of "loose coal" in fourteen days. According to the Mine Director, this "loose coal" is produced every day and must be cleaned up every day. The current sweeping is not yet thorough.

### 永定庄矿工扫集“浮煤”

    永定庄矿工扫集“浮煤”
    本报讯　在1月份的十多天内，大同煤矿永定庄矿的工人们，光扫“浮煤”就增产了煤炭六百吨。
    当采下煤来，工人们用铁锹往输送煤的电溜子里攉煤的时候，许多炭块煤末便抛撒在电溜子的两侧和底部，电溜子下面还堆成了一道像田埂一样的低矮煤墙，这就是“浮煤”。以往人们不把“浮煤”放在眼里，认为比起出煤的数量来，它只占一小点，所以都丢在井下了。
    1月初，永定庄矿举行了一次动员增产节约的职工大会，党委书记和矿长在算这一笔账的时候，指出：井下“浮煤”数量很大，全矿每天丢的“浮煤”，相当于一个小回采工作面每天产煤的数量。
    工人们听了，都很惊异，纷纷表示要堵塞这个浪费的漏洞。六号井段长带头扫“浮煤”，从1月8日起的七天内，扫集“浮煤”一百四十五吨。十七号井的工人们在十四天内，扫了“浮煤”一百八十吨。据矿长谈，这种“浮煤”每天都有，必须每天清扫，现在扫的还不算彻底。
