Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 22nd: A large-scale political publicity campaign aimed at promoting the superiority of advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives to farmers is gradually unfolding in the vast rural areas of Hebei Province. According to statistics from Tongxian, Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, and other four special districts alone, more than fifty members of the prefectural party committees have gone to various counties to deploy this campaign and deliver reports to cadres and the masses. Li Yuenong, secretary of the CPC Baoding Prefectural Committee, has already delivered reports to more than two thousand three hundred cadres and cooperative members. In counties where the campaign is progressing faster, more than half of the county committee members have gone to the countryside to train publicity teams in designated areas and directly conduct publicity among the masses. In Baoding Prefecture, seven counties have drawn more than four hundred cadres above the district committee level, who are training publicity backbones under the leadership of county committee members. More than 150,000 propagandists and 1,500 reporters in Zhangjiakou Prefecture and some counties in Baoding Prefecture are using various forms to publicize the superiority of advanced cooperatives to the masses in conjunction with current production activities. Mancheng County universally convened cooperative member meetings in various townships, where county and district cadres, in light of local conditions, used facts to educate the masses through accounting, recalling, and comparison, and widely solicited the opinions of cooperative members through seminars and discussions.
 
After publicity and education, the broad masses of cadres and people have enhanced their confidence in running cooperatives. Some township and cooperative cadres have dispelled the idea of switching jobs. They have correctly recognized the achievements and problems of running advanced cooperatives for the past year and are actively leading cooperative members to invest in production campaigns. In Mancheng County, the labor force participating in production has increased from 50% to over 80% of the total labor force. After listening to the publicity, the members of the Haozhuang Township agricultural cooperative in Lincheng County said: It turns out that we didn't go wrong on our path (referring to advanced cooperatives), let's work harder!
 
The purpose of this publicity campaign in Hebei Province is to use facts to publicize the achievements of advanced cooperativization over the past year to the broad masses of farmers, explain the reasons for some of the current problems in rural areas, promote positive factors, overcome negative factors, and push various rural production activities to a climax. At the end of December last year, the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee issued instructions on carrying out a political publicity campaign. Before the campaign was universally launched, all localities specifically studied the ideological situation of local farmers, analyzed the current problems in rural work, and formulated specific plans for carrying out a political publicity campaign in conjunction with production and rectification of cooperatives.
 
This newspaper reports that, according to central instructions, the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee requested that the entire province widely and deeply carry out current affairs publicity from the New Year to around the Spring Festival, in order to stimulate the enthusiasm of the broad masses in building socialism. The Hebei Provincial Committee requested that through this publicity, the masses should universally understand the current international situation and the great achievements made by our country in socialist construction and socialist transformation in 1956. In cities, publicity should focus on the great achievements of industrial construction and the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and handicrafts, in conjunction with the campaign to increase production and practice economy; publicize the necessity of arduous construction, so that the masses understand the correct relationship between developing production and improving people's lives, understand the reasons for the current shortages of certain materials and the attitude they should adopt, and understand the great significance of carrying forward the spirit of hard struggle to support farmers and rural production, so as to promote the campaign to increase production and practice economy. In rural areas, publicity should focus on the great achievements of agricultural socialist transformation and agricultural production, in conjunction with the rectification of cooperatives; publicize the superiority of advanced cooperatives and various policies for production and cooperative management, in order to encourage the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers. In areas where conscription work is being carried out, the masses should also be mobilized to actively enlist in military service. Regardless of whether it is in cities or rural areas, attention should be paid to educating the masses to practice thrift during the Spring Festival in publicity. The Hebei Provincial Committee requested that party committees at all levels widely organize publicity forces. Party committees above the county level can organize responsible party and government comrades to meet with the masses and give reports. The grassroots publicity teams should be trained to give full play to the role of the publicity network. The relevant leaders should assign tasks to cadres, workers, and students who return home during the Spring Festival and mobilize them to carry out publicity among the masses.
 
This newspaper reports, according to the Henan Daily, after the CPC Henan Provincial Committee issued a notice on widely carrying out publicity campaigns during the Spring Festival, the Xinxiang, Anyang, Xuchang, Luoyang, and Xinyang prefectural committees and the Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, Kaifeng, Xuchang, and Jiaozuo municipal committees held emergency publicity work meetings in mid-January, respectively, to formulate publicity plans and put forward specific measures and requirements. The Xuchang area has currently trained more than 88,000 rural party member backbones. The prefectural committee requested that each county form a reporting group with the county committee as the core, carry out systematic roving reports by dividing points and covering townships; with the branch as the core and the cooperative as the unit, absorb various model figures from the masses to publicize the superiority of cooperativization by using their own experiences. The Xinyang prefectural committee plans to organize a large publicity force in the entire district, requiring each county and city to organize reporting groups, led by the county and city party secretaries, to carry out publicity activities by dividing tasks and covering townships. The Xinxiang Municipal Committee has organized the city's 275 reporters into a reporting group with the municipal committee as the core. In addition to the reporters from factories, enterprises, and schools giving reports in their own units, other reporters will give reports in handicraft cooperatives, streets, and rural areas, requiring each reporter to give at least two reports. In order to deeply carry out the publicity campaign, the Xinxiang County Committee has convened a mobilization meeting of 1,700 people including county, township, and cooperative cadres and mass activists. After the meeting, they universally reflected that they increasingly saw the superiority of advanced cooperatives, their minds were clear, and they had something to publicize when they returned. Starting from the 20th, eighteen county committee members and ninety-seven cadres drawn from county and district organs to enrich the lower levels went to the countryside together and began to take action. In order to ensure that the content of the publicity is rich and lively, the Xuchang and Luoyang prefectural committees have compiled report outlines or supplementary materials. The Xuchang Municipal Committee is currently drawing a group of painters to compile and draw publicity materials, training lecturers, and actively preparing to organize a large-scale exhibition during the Spring Festival on current affairs, agricultural cooperativization, increasing production and practicing economy, the Second Five-Year Plan, the advanced deeds of model figures, and physical objects.

    宣传合作化的伟大成就　把各项生产运动推向高潮
    河北河南开展大规模宣传运动
    新华社保定22日电　一个向农民宣传高级合作化优越性的大规模的政治宣传运动正在河北省广大农村中逐步展开。仅据通县、唐山、张家口等四个专区统计，就已经有五十多名地委委员分赴各县部署这一运动并向干部、群众作报告。中共保定地委书记李悦农已经向二千三百多名干部和社员作了报告。运动进展较快的县份，已经有半数以上的县委委员下乡分片训练宣传队伍并直接向群众进行宣传。在保定专区，有七个县已抽出四百多名区委以上干部，正在县委委员带领下训练宣传骨干。张家口专区和保定专区部分县的十五万多名宣传员和一千五百多名报告员，正结合当前生产活动用不同形式向群众宣传高级合作化的优越性。满城县各乡普遍地召开了社员大会，由县、区干部联系本地情况，通过算账、回忆、对比等方式，以实事来向群众进行教育，并通过座谈、讨论等办法，广泛征求了社员的意见。
    广大干部、群众经过宣传教育后增强了办社信心。有些乡、社干部已经打消了换班思想。他们正确地认识了办高级社一年来的成绩和问题，正在积极地领导社员投入生产运动。满城县参加生产的劳动力，已由总劳动力的50％上升到80％以上。临城县郝庄乡农业社的社员们听了宣传以后说：原来我们的道儿（指高级社）没走错，加劲干吧！
    河北省这次宣传运动的目的是为了用事实向广大农民宣传高级合作化一年来的成绩，说明目前农村中存在着某些问题的原因，发扬积极因素，克服消极因素，将农村各项生产活动推向高潮。去年12月底，中共河北省委就发出了关于开展政治宣传运动的指示，各地在运动普遍展开以前，都具体地研究了当地农民的思想情况，分析了当前农村工作中的问题，并制定了结合生产整社开展政治宣传运动的具体计划。
    本报讯　中共河北省委，根据中央指示，要求全省从新年到春节前后，广泛深入地进行时事宣传，以激发广大群众建设社会主义的积极性。河北省委要求通过这次宣传，使群众普遍了解当前的国际局势，及1956年我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造获得的巨大成就。在城市中，应该结合增产节约运动，着重宣传工业建设、资本主义工商业和手工业改造的巨大成就；宣传艰苦建设的必要性，使群众了解发展生产和提高人民生活的正确关系，使群众了解当前某些物资供不应求的原因和应持的态度，了解发扬艰苦奋斗精神支持农民和农村生产的重大意义等，以推动增产节约运动。在农村中，应该结合整社，着重宣传农业社会主义改造和农业生产的巨大成绩。宣传高级社的优越性，以及生产办社的各项政策，以鼓舞广大农民的生产热情。在进行征兵工作的地区，还应该动员群众踊跃应征服兵役。无论城市农村，在宣传中，都应注意教育群众在春节期间厉行节约。河北省委要求各级党委广泛组织宣传力量。县以上的党委，可以组织党、政负责同志和群众见面作报告。对基层宣传队伍要加以训练，充分发挥宣传网作用。对春节期间回家的干部、职工、学生，有关的领导方面要分配给他们任务，发动他们向群众作宣传。
    本报讯　据河南日报消息：中共河南省委关于在春节期间广泛开展宣传运动的通知发出后，新乡、安阳、许昌、洛阳、信阳地委和郑州、新乡、开封、许昌、焦作市委分别于1月中旬召开紧急宣传工作会议，制定了宣传计划，提出了具体措施和要求。许昌地区目前已训练了农村党员骨干八万八千多人。地委要求各县以县委为核心组成报告团，分点包乡作系统的巡回报告；以支部为核心，以社为单位，吸收群众中各种模范人物参加，用现身说法的方法宣传合作化的优越性。信阳地委计划在全区组织宣传大军，要求各县、市组织报告团，以县、市委书记为首分工包乡开展宣传活动。新乡市委已把全市二百七十五名报告员组织起来，以市委为核心组成报告团。除工厂、企业、学校的报告员在本单位作报告外，其他报告员分别到手工业社、街道、农村作报告，要求每个报告员至少报告两次。新乡县委为深入开展宣传运动，已召开县、乡、社和群众积极分子共一千七百人的动员大会。会后，他们普遍反映，越来越看清了高级社的优越性，头脑清醒了，回去有得宣传了。从20日起，十八名县委委员和抽调县区机关充实下层的九十七名干部一同下乡，开始行动。为了保证宣传内容丰富生动，许昌、洛阳地委都编写了报告提纲或补充材料。许昌市委目前正在抽调一批绘画人员编画宣传材料，训练讲解员，积极筹备在春节期间组织一次规模较大的有关目前时势、农业合作化、增产节约、第二个五年计划、模范人物的先进事迹、实物等展览会。
