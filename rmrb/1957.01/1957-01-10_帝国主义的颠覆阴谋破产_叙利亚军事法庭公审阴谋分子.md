Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from Damascus: A Syrian military tribunal began a public trial on the 8th of forty-seven conspirators who, supported by foreign governments, attempted to overthrow the current Syrian government by force.

Of these forty-seven people, only twenty-nine appeared in court that day. The other eighteen have fled abroad. Among them are Shishakli, who launched a coup in November 1951 with the support of imperialism and served as president for three years, as well as several former government ministers, members of parliament, and some senior army officers.

On this day, the auditorium of the Syrian University was filled with two thousand members of the public. At the opening of the trial, the director of the Syrian Army Intelligence Bureau, Abdul Hamid Serraj, first read a background report on the case. In his report, he accused the Iraqi government of supporting the conspiracy. The report stated that Iraqi Foreign Minister Basha'yan met with Shishakli in Geneva last summer and discussed the conspiracy with him. Basha'yan also finalized the details of the conspiracy with Iraqi Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, Ghaleb Daghistani, in Switzerland, and finally decided to organize riots at the end of last year during the Anglo-French intervention in the Suez Canal.

The report said that Colonel Mohammed Safa, former Syrian military attache in Washington, was also involved in the conspiracy.

The report pointed out that the purpose of the conspiracy was to undermine Syria's independence and make it a slave of imperialism.

The report said that Shishakli accepted 15,000 pounds from Britain, France, and Iraq to instigate a coup in Syria.

Adnan Aidi, a conspirator accused of acting as a liaison in the conspiracy, admitted in court on the 8th that there was a "pro-Iraqi conspiracy to overthrow the current Syrian regime." He also spoke in detail about the conspiracy.

The Syrian authorities published an indictment related to the case last December. The indictment pointed out that the conspiracy was directed behind the scenes by imperialism, and the Iraqi Said government acted as the executor of the conspiracy.

    帝国主义的颠覆阴谋破产
    叙利亚军事法庭公审阴谋分子
    新华社9日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚军事法庭8日开始公审在外国政府支持下企图以武力推翻叙利亚现政府的四十七个阴谋分子。
    在这四十七个人当中，当天出庭的只有二十九人，其他十八人都已经逃往国外，其中包括1951年11月在帝国主义支持下发动政变并且担任过三年总统的施舍克里，几个前政府部长、议员和一些陆军高级军官。
    这一天，叙利亚大学的礼堂坐满了二千旁听的公众，在开庭的时候，叙利亚陆军情报处处长阿卜杜勒·哈密德·塞拉杰首先宣读了有关这个案件的背景说明报告。他在报告中指责伊拉克政府支持这个阴谋。报告说，伊拉克外交大臣巴沙扬去年夏天在日内瓦会见施舍克里时曾经同他讨论过这个阴谋。巴沙扬并且还同伊拉克陆军副参谋长加勒布·达吉斯塔尼到瑞士最后确定了这次阴谋活动的细节安排，最后决定在去年年底在英法干涉苏伊士运河期间组织暴动。
    报告说，前叙利亚驻华盛顿的武官穆罕默德·萨法上校也同这个阴谋有关。
    报告指出，这个阴谋的目的是想破坏叙利亚的独立，并且使它成为帝国主义的奴隶。
    报告说，施舍克里为了在叙利亚策动政变，还从英国、法国和伊拉克那里接受了一万五千英镑。
    被控在这次阴谋中担任联络工作的阴谋分子阿德南·艾迪，8日在法庭上承认有“推翻叙利亚现政权的亲伊拉克的阴谋”。他并且详细地谈到了这个阴谋的情况。
    叙利亚当局去年12月曾经发表过有关这个案件的起诉书。起诉书中指出，这个阴谋是帝国主义在幕后指使的，伊拉克的赛义德政府充当了这个阴谋的执行人。
