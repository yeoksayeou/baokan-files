    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 26th - According to the Hungarian News Agency, due to the Hungarian Writers' Association and the Hungarian National Journalists' Association conducting activities that violate national interests and do not conform to their own regulations, the Ministry of State Affairs of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, in accordance with the Presidential Council's emergency decree on the supervision of social organizations, has decided to temporarily suspend the activities of these two organizations and to appoint commissioners to rectify the work of the two associations respectively. In addition, seven writers and journalists have been arrested on suspicion of participating in counter-revolutionary activities. Those arrested include Gyula Háy, the former vice-chairman of the Writers' Association.
    When Minister of the Armed Forces of Hungary, Münnich, spoke to a journalist from the German News Agency stationed in Budapest regarding the aforementioned measures, he pointed out that the Hungarian Writers' Association and the National Journalists' Association had conducted activities that no country could tolerate, so there was reason to take these measures. An investigation is currently underway into certain members of these two associations, but the government absolutely does not consider all journalists or writers to be counter-revolutionaries or anti-people elements.

    停止作家协会和记者协会的活动
    新华社布达佩斯26日电　据匈牙利通讯社报道，由于匈牙利作家协会和匈牙利全国记者协会进行了违反国家利益和不符合它们自己规章的活动，匈牙利工农革命政府国务部根据共和国主席团关于监督社会组织的紧急法令，决定暂时停止这两个组织的活动，并且分别指派专员来整顿这两个协会的工作，此外，有七名作家和记者，因为有参加反革命活动重大嫌疑而被捕。被捕的人中包括前作家协会副主席久拉·海伊。
    匈牙利武装部队部部长明尼赫在就上述措施向德意志通讯社驻布达佩斯记者发表谈话时指出，匈牙利作家协会和全国记者协会进行了任何国家都不能容忍的活动，所以有理由采取这些措施。现在正在对这两个协会的某些会员进行调查，但是政府绝对不认为所有的记者或作家都是反革命或反人民分子。
