Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, December 30th. The Karamay Oilfield achieved significant accomplishments in its exploration work in 1956. Through the diligent efforts of the workers over the past year, a vast area of oil-bearing land has been explored. The proven oil reserves now greatly exceed the task assigned to the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration by the state during the First Five-Year Plan period. Of the more than thirty exploratory wells drilled, twenty-five have undergone oil testing, and nine have begun trial production. The crude oil production from these trial production wells has remained consistently normal.

In 1956, regional exploration was also carried out across the entire oilfield, covering approximately four thousand square kilometers, using dozens of drilling rigs, which identified directions for future large-scale exploration. The wells arranged in the Urho area (more than one hundred kilometers northeast of Karamay) and the Baijitan area (between Karamay and Urho) show good oil sand and gas indications, indicating great potential for oil content. These two areas have been designated as key exploration areas for 1957.

Another significant achievement in the oilfield exploration in 1956 was the discovery of new oil layers during oil testing and drilling, with three wells spontaneously producing crude oil. This situation indicates that Karamay is not a single-layer oilfield but a multi-layer oilfield, which greatly increases the economic value of this oilfield. In addition, geological exploration work over the past year has preliminarily proven that Karamay is an oilfield with diverse oil reservoir types.

As of December 23rd, the Karamay Mining Bureau had exceeded the 1956 state plan for drilling footage, oil testing, and trial production. Drilling costs and oil production costs were significantly lower than the state-set targets, and the drilling rig utilization rate was 24.6% higher than the state plan target.

    克拉玛依油田的捷报
    新华社克拉玛依30日电　克拉玛依油田勘探工作在1956年取得了重大的成就。经过职工们一年来的辛勤劳动，已经探出了广大区域的储油面积，现在探明的石油储量已经大大超过国家给予新疆石油管理局第一个五年计划期间的任务。已经钻完的三十多口探井，其中经过试油的有二十五口井，开始试采的有九口井，这些试采的井，原油产量一直保持正常。
    1956年还在约四千平方公里的整个油田范围内，以几十部钻机进行了区域性的勘探，为今后进行更大规模勘探找出了方向。布置在乌尔禾地区（在克拉玛依东北一百多公里）和白碱滩地区（在克拉玛依和乌尔禾之间）的钻井中都有良好的油沙气显示，有很大的含油希望。这两个地区已经被确定为1957年的勘探重点。
    1956年油田勘探中的另一重大收获，是在试油和钻井过程中发现了新的油层，有三口井自喷出了原油。这一情况表明克拉玛依不是单一油层的油田，而是个多油层的油田，这就大大地提高了这个油田的经济价值。此外，一年来的地质勘探工作还初步证明克拉玛依是个油藏类型多种多样的油田。
    到12月23日为止，克拉玛依矿务局钻井进尺、试油、试采工作都超过了1956年的国家计划。钻井成本和采油成本都比国家规定的指标降低很多，钻机使用率比国家计划指标提高了24.6％。
