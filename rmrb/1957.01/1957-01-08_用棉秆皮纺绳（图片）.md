Spinning Rope with Cotton Stalk Peel

In major cotton-producing areas such as Handan and Shijiazhuang in Hebei Province, agricultural cooperatives are widely using cotton stalk peel to replace hemp skin for spinning ropes and weaving bags, which not only solves the problem of material shortage but also increases the income of cooperative members.
