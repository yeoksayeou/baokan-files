Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 24th: U.S. President Eisenhower held his first press conference on January 23rd after formally taking office for his current term. Talking about his request to Congress for the authority to use U.S. armed forces in the Middle East, he said that "there was a time when we used to land Marines in these small countries to maintain order," and that the U.S. intends to continue doing this. When asked about the possibility of the U.S. using small tactical nuclear weapons in the Middle East, Eisenhower was unwilling to give a specific answer. He said that he had previously stated that the U.S. "does regard such small (nuclear) weapons as almost conventional parts of our equipment today, you almost have to use them."

He also emphasized that the part of the Middle East plan concerning the use of U.S. armed forces is inseparable from the economic and military aid parts. He said that it is not possible to accomplish the work that needs to be done with weapons alone. Limiting oneself to one aspect would be "a self-defeating approach."

A reporter asked him whether he was considering discussing or communicating with Soviet leaders in order to ease tensions. He replied that this issue must be dealt with as things happen. Currently, he is "not contemplating any communication," and "doesn't know what would be an appropriate topic for such communication at present."

When a reporter asked the President what he wanted to do during his current term, he replied: "It is essential to make steady progress in strengthening international understanding. First, to achieve better understanding among the free nations of the world, second, especially to achieve better understanding with the Russians, the Russian government; and finally, to sign some agreements that we can all trust them to honor."

Speaking about the ban on American journalists visiting China, Eisenhower said that he "will not consider changing this policy" until the situation regarding the American "captured personnel" allegedly "detained" in China changes.

A reporter asked the U.S. President whether he would soon meet with the new British Prime Minister Macmillan and whether he would invite Yugoslav President Tito to visit the United States. He said that some foreign politicians are being arranged to visit the United States, but he "can't be too specific." He also said that he himself does not plan to travel abroad.

    艾森豪威尔谈侵略中东计划
    公然威胁要在小国使用武力
    表示要同苏联取得谅解但又不愿在目前有所作为
    据新华社24日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔23日举行他正式就任本届总统后的第一次记者招待会。他在谈到他要求国会授予他在中东地区使用美国武装部队的权力时说，“在一个时期，我们经常派海军陆战队在一些小国家登陆来维护秩序”等等，他表示美国要继续这样作。在被问到美国在中东地区使用小型战术原子武器的可能性的问题时，艾森豪威尔不愿具体回答这个问题，他说，他先前曾经说过，美国“的确把这种小型（原子）武器当作差不多是我们今天的装备的常规部分，你几乎必须使用它们”。
    他又强调，中东计划里使用美国武装部队部分同经济和军事援助部分是不能分开的。他说，不能仅仅靠武器来完成需要做的工作。如果局限于一个方面，那“是自招失败的做法”。
    有记者问他是否在考虑同苏联领袖们讨论或者通讯以期缓和紧张局势。他回答说，这个问题必须看发生的情况随时加以处理。现在，他“没有考虑进行任何通讯”，“不知道在目前有什么可以进行这种通讯的适当的题目”。
    在记者问到总统在本届任期内要做的事情时，他回答说：“一定要在加强国际谅解方面有步骤地取得进展。首先在世界上的自由国家之间取得更好的谅解，其次，特别是跟俄国人、俄国政府取得较好的谅解；最后，签定一些我们大家都能信任他们的协定。”
    在谈到禁止美国记者访问中国的问题时，艾森豪威尔说，在中国“扣留着”美国的所谓“被俘人员”的情况没有改变以前，他“将不考虑改变这种政策”。
    有记者问美国总统，他是否很快要同英国新首相麦克米伦会谈以及是否将邀请南斯拉夫铁托总统访问美国。他说，正在安排一些外国政治家访问美国，但是他“不能说得太具体”。他同时说，他自己不准备出国访问。
