    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th. Japanese Prime Minister Tanzan Ishibashi said at a press conference on the 4th that when compiling the 1957 national budget, the Japanese government intends to emphasize overseas investment as a basis for expanding trade.
    Ishibashi said, "I would like to see investment in Southeast Asia and Central and South America. We can also provide technical assistance to establish a basis for expanding Japanese trade."
    Japanese newspapers believe that Japan's efforts to strengthen overseas investment are related to the current economic situation. Japan's mining and industrial production level has increased to more than twice the pre-war level, but foreign trade has still not recovered to the pre-war level. At the same time, some domestic consumer goods production sectors have shown a tendency towards overproduction.

    日本准备增加国外投资
    作为扩大对外贸易基础
    据新华社6日讯　东京消息：日本首相石桥湛山4日在记者招待会上说，在编制1957年度国家预算的时候，日本政府准备强调海外投资，把这当作扩大贸易的基础。
    石桥说，“我愿意看到在东南亚和中美洲和南美洲进行投资。我们也能够提供技术援助来建立扩大日本贸易的基础。”
    日本报刊认为，日本加强海外投资的努力是同当前的经济情况有关的。日本矿工业生产水平已经增加到战前水平的二倍以上，而对外贸易却仍然没有恢复到战前水平。同时，国内一些消费资料生产部门已经表现出生产过剩的倾向。
