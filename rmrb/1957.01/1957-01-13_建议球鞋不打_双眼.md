    Suggestion: Don't put "double eyelets" on sneakers
    Currently, all kinds of boots and shoes produced nationwide have single eyelets, except for sneakers which have double eyelets (meaning shoe eyelets are punched on both sides). I believe there is room for improvement.
    Whether shoes have single or double eyelets, they are the same in terms of usage and appearance. Leather shoes and cloth shoes all have single eyelets, and we don't feel uncomfortable wearing them. At the same time, it does not affect the quality of the shoes. It is clear that sneakers can also be changed to single eyelets. There are the following benefits to single eyelets on sneakers:
    First, it saves lead sheets and reduces costs. Generally, each pair of sneakers has twenty-eight eyelets, requiring fifty-six lead shoe eyelets. If changed to single eyelets, half of the lead can be reduced. Taking our factory as an example, we can save the country 42,738 yuan a year. If promoted nationwide, the amount saved would be even more considerable.
    Second, it can shorten production time and improve work efficiency. Because making double eyelets is more technically demanding and complex than making single eyelets; our factory's most skilled workers could only make 440 pairs of shoe eyelets a day, but if changed to single eyelets, efficiency can be doubled.
    I have made this suggestion to the technicians in the factory, but they said, "This is a central government regulation and cannot be changed." Therefore, I once again suggest that the relevant central departments study this issue and improve the method of making eyelets for sneakers.

### 建议球鞋不打“双眼”

    建议球鞋不打“双眼”
    目前全国生产的各种靴鞋都是单打眼，唯独球鞋是双打眼（即里面都打鞋眼），我认为有改进的必要。
    鞋子上打单眼和打双眼在使用和美观上都一样；皮鞋、布鞋都是单打眼，我们穿着也没有什么不舒服。同时对鞋的质量也没有影响，可见球鞋也完全可以改为单打眼。球鞋打单眼有如下好处：
    首先是节约铅片，降低成本。一般球鞋每双有二十八个眼，需要五十六个铅制鞋眼。若改为打单眼，就可减少一半的铅。以我厂为例，一年就可为国家节约四万二千七百三十八元；如果在全国推广，节约的数目就更可观了。
    其次可缩短生产时间，提高工作效率。因为打双眼在技术要求和复杂程度上都比打单眼高；我厂最熟练的工人原来一天只能打四百四十双鞋眼，改为打单眼则效率可以提高一倍。
    这个建议我曾向厂里的技师提过，他说：“这是中央的规定，不能更改”。因此我再一次建议中央有关部门加以研究，把球鞋打眼的办法改进一下。
