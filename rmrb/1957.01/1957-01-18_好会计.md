    Good Accountant
    When you walk into the Yunxing Agricultural Cooperative in Xianyou County, Fujian Province, whether it is the cooperative's cadres or the members, they will tell you: "Yang Zheying is a good accountant."
    Yang Zheying is indeed a good accountant. Over the past year, he has adhered to the principle of running the cooperative diligently and frugally, saving a considerable amount of funds for the cooperative.
    At the beginning of last year, when the cooperative was just established, it needed to purchase various account books and forms. Yang Zheying planned to buy a mimeograph machine to print them himself. But after calculating that it would cost forty or fifty yuan, he felt a little reluctant. Later, in the pile of waste in the old township government office, he found a broken mimeograph machine, and he tried to find gauze and parts to use it. In this way, he saved the cooperative more than two hundred yuan in a year.
    In early November, several production team leaders came to Yang Zheying with a stack of invoices for reimbursement. After carefully reviewing them, he picked out a few and said: Using production funds to buy musical instruments without the approval of the Cooperative Management Committee is not reimbursable. Some team leaders said: Just this once, reimburse us, it's only a few dozen yuan. Yang Zheying said: If we, a cooperative of three hundred and fifty households, are not careful with our money, we will waste a lot of it, and in the end, everyone will suffer. One production team leader said anxiously: What's done is done, what do you want us to do? Yang Zheying did not compromise. Finally, he suggested mobilizing members who loved recreational activities to engage in some side occupations to raise money to buy these musical instruments. The team leaders thought this was a good solution that would not cost money and solve the problem.
    When the cooperative planned winter planting, there was a shortage of fertilizer, and 479 mu of wheat and barley needed to be fertilized with commercial fertilizer. After doing the math, he felt it would cost too much money, so he went to discuss it with the members. The members came up with many ways to accumulate fertilizer, such as hoeing grass turf on the mountains and splitting sweet potato garden field embankment grass. After Yang Zheying raised the members' ideas at the cooperative committee meeting, he obtained the consent of the cooperative committee and mobilized the members to accumulate more fertilizer. As a result, another 308 mu of land was fertilized with local fertilizer. In this way, Yang Zheying saved the cooperative more than three thousand yuan. (Yang Mingqing)

    好会计
    当你走进福建仙游县云星农业社的时候，不论是社里的干部，还是社员，都会告诉你：“杨哲英是个好会计。”
    杨哲英确实是个好会计。一年来，他坚持了勤俭办社方针，给社里节约了一笔不小的资金。
    去年年初，合作社刚办起来，需要添置各种账簿和表格。杨哲英打算买一架油印机来自己印。但他算一算要花四、五十元，心里有点舍不得。后来，他在旧乡政府办公地方的废物堆中，找出一架破烂的油印机，他便设法把纱布、零件配好来使用。这样一年就替社里节约了二百多元。
    11月初，几个生产队长拿着一叠发票向杨哲英报销。他仔细看过后，从中拣出几张说：拿生产资金买乐器，又没有经过社务管理委员会批准，不能报销。有的队长说：只这一次，给我们报销吧，也不过几十元钱。杨哲英说：我们这三百五十来户的社，用钱要是不仔细，就会浪费很多钱，到头来还不是大家吃亏。有个生产队长发急地说：生米煮成熟饭啦，叫我们怎么办？杨哲英并没有迁就，最后他建议发动爱好文娱活动的社员搞些副业，凑钱把这批乐器买下来。队长们听了这番话，也认为是既不花钱又能解决问题的好办法。
    社里计划冬种的时候，土肥不足，还有四百七十九亩大小麦得买商品肥料。他算了一下账，觉得花钱太多，就去和社员们商量。社员们提出了许多积肥的办法，如到山上锄草皮土、劈番薯园的田岸草等。杨哲英在社委会上把社员们想的办法提出来后，得到了社委会的同意，并发动社员多积土肥。结果，又有三百零八亩地施了土肥，这样，杨哲英又为社节省了三千多元。　（杨明清）
