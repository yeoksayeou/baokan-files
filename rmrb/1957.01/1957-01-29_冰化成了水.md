Ice Turned into Water
(Fable)

It is said that the Monkey King, unwilling to be a stable boy, angrily left the Heavenly Palace and returned to the Water Curtain Cave. After that, thinking about the lively exchange of official documents in the Heavenly Palace, he felt there might be some merit to it. So, he established a series of strict official document systems in the cave.

One day, a small macaque found a large piece of ice in a stream. The Water Curtain Cave was always warm like spring, so the sudden appearance of a block of ice was feared as an ominous sign. Thus, it sent the ice to the external dispatch clerk, requesting a report be made to superiors.

The external dispatch clerk signed for it as usual, wrote the four big characters "For Review and Instructions," signed his name, and sent it to the internal dispatch clerk. The internal dispatch clerk also signed for it as usual, and also signed his name below "For Review and Instructions," and submitted it upwards. Thus, level by level, signing and submitting, the ice gradually melted and shrank. Somewhere along the way, someone had a stroke of genius and put the ice in a cup before submitting it further. This went through who knows how many more procedures before it reached the Monkey King. The Monkey King looked at it. It was a cup of cold water, but in front of the dozens of signatures were the four big characters: "For Review and Instructions." He was very puzzled.

The Monkey King, after all, wasn't just another old bureaucrat. He didn't just write "Read" and leave it at that. His puzzlement turned to anger, and he wrote a line on the document: "What is there to seek instructions about a cup of cold water? Instructed to make a self-criticism." The secretary received it and added a comment: "Instructed to make a profound self-criticism!"

So the document was passed down level by level, going through who knows how many signatures, and finally reached the hands of the external dispatch clerk.

The external dispatch clerk handled many documents every day. Although everything was registered, he couldn't remember what was going on with this cup of cold water. He was puzzled, he was distressed, and he also wanted to make a self-criticism—he just didn't know what mistake he should be deeply criticizing!

    冰化成了水
    （寓言）
    却说美猴王不愿意当弼马温，一怒走出天宫，回到水帘洞以后，想起天宫里公文来往的热闹情况，觉得也许有点道理，就在洞里建立了一系列严密的公文制度。
    一天，有个小猕猴在水涧里拣到一大块冰。水帘洞一向温暖如春，忽然出现了冰块，恐系不祥之兆；于是就把那块冰送给了外收发，请求向上汇报。
    外收发照例签收，写了“呈阅请示”四个大字，签了名，送给了内收发。内收发也照例签收，又照例在“呈阅请示”下面签了个字，往上呈送。如此一级级地签收，签字，往上呈送，冰块也就渐渐融化，渐渐缩小了。中间不知哪一位福至心灵，把那块冰装在一只杯子里，再往上呈送。如此又经过不知多少道手续，才到了美猴王手里。美猴王一看，乃是一杯冷水，签了几十个名字的前面却是四个大字：“呈阅请示”，因此心中十分纳罕。
    美猴王毕竟还不是老公事，他并没有批个“阅”字了事；他由纳罕变为生气，在公文上批了一行：“一杯冷水又有什么可请示的，着即检讨。”秘书接过来，也添了一个批示：“着即深刻检讨！”
    于是公文又层层下达，又经过了不知多少签收和签字，最后送到了外收发的手里。
    外收发一天经手的公文很多，虽然件件都有登记，对着这一杯冷水却记不起是怎么一回事了。他纳罕，他苦闷，他也想检讨——就是不知道应该深刻检讨的是什么错误！
