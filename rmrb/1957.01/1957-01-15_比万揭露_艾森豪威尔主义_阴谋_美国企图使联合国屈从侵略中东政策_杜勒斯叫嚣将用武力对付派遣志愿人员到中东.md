Xinhua News Agency, London, 14th - Labour Party Treasurer Bevan, in an article published in the "Reynold News" on the 13th, said that the U.S. Middle East plan is "deliberately plunging the world into the nightmare of a final war."

Bevan said, "This is a decision to make U.S. military intervention in the Middle East subject to the Security Council's decision only after it has already begun—note the word 'after'."

"Thus, U.S. armed forces can take action before the Security Council has a chance to judge the merits of the issue."

"Under these circumstances, the full force of U.S. influence will inevitably be used to obtain a decision favorable to the United States."

Referring to Eisenhower's defense that his proposal provides for immediate action against aggressors, Bevan said that it is Eisenhower, not the United Nations, who first determines whether an act of aggression has in fact occurred.

Xinhua News Agency, January 14th - Cairo News: British Labour MP Summerskill, responding to a question about the U.S. Middle East plan in Cairo, said, "The Arab people should and can fill the vacuum. I would be insulted if someone called me an intellectual vacuum."

Speaking to reporters at Cairo airport on the 13th about the "Eisenhower Doctrine," she also said, "What amazes me most is that the tune of a political vacuum is constantly being repeated, and this statement is the most insulting and slanderous attitude."

Xinhua News Agency, January 14th - Washington News: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, in explaining the request to Congress to grant the President the power to use armed forces in the Middle East, said that the U.S. would also use armed forces to deal with sending organized volunteers to Middle Eastern countries. He said, "If organized volunteers are used, it should be considered open aggression." Dulles, in specifying the countries from which he envisioned volunteers might come, mentioned the Soviet Union and China.

Dulles said this while testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 8th. The committee released a portion of his testimony on the 12th.

Dulles also said that the military aspect of the Eisenhower Doctrine needs to be complemented by the "economic assistance" aspect, otherwise the doctrine will fail. He said that, in principle, U.S. "aid" will only be given to those countries that "truly want to oppose international communism," and will be unwilling to provide "aid" to those governments that "sympathize with international communism." He pointed out that despite Egypt's extremely difficult economic situation, the U.S. currently has no intention of giving Egypt "economic aid" unless doing so helps the so-called "struggle against international communism."

In his testimony, he said, "When the U.S. government considers the defense of the Middle East, it considers the region from Libya in the west to Pakistan in the east, Turkey in the north, and the Arabian Peninsula in the south."

    比万揭露“艾森豪威尔主义”阴谋
    美国企图使联合国屈从侵略中东政策
    杜勒斯叫嚣将用武力对付派遣志愿人员到中东
    据新华社伦敦14日电　工党司库比万在13日的“雷诺新闻”上发表文章说，美国的中东计划是“有意要把世界投到最后的战争的恶梦中去”。
    比万说，“这是决定要使美国对中东的军事干涉在它已经开始以后——注意以后二字——才使它服从安全理事会的决定。
      “这样，美国的武装力量就可以在安全理事会有机会来判断问题的是非以前采取行动。
      “在这种情况之下，必然要使用美国影响的全部力量以便得到对美国有利的决定。”
    在提到艾森豪威尔所说的他的建议是规定对侵略者立即行动的这种辩解时，比万说，首先来断定事实上是否有过侵略行动这件事的是艾森豪威尔而不是联合国。
    据新华社14日讯　开罗消息：英国工党女议员萨末斯基尔在开罗答复关于美国的中东计划的问题时说，“阿拉伯人民应该，而且能够填补真空。如果有人把我叫做思想真空的话，我会感到受侮辱。”
    她13日在开罗机场上对新闻记者谈到“艾森豪威尔主义”时还说，“最使我惊异的是，老是在重弹政治真空的调子，这种说法是最使人感到受侮辱和诬蔑人的态度”。
    新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯在解释要求国会给予总统在中东地区使用武装部队的权力时说，美国也将使用武装部队来对付派遣有组织的志愿人员到中东国家去。他说，“如果使用有组织的志愿人员，这就应该认为是公开的侵略。”杜勒斯在说明他心目中志愿人员可能来自的国家时，提到了苏联和中国。
    杜勒斯是8日在美国众议院外交委员会作证时这样说的。委员会在12日公布了他的证词的一部分。
    杜勒斯还说，艾森豪威尔主义的军事方面需要配合以“经济援助”方面，否则这个主义将会失败。他说，在原则上，美国的“援助”将只给予那些“真正希望反对国际共产主义”的国家，而不愿意对那些“同情国际共产主义”的政府提供“援助”。他指出，尽管埃及的经济情况十分困难，美国目前仍然无意给予埃及以“经济援助”，除非这样做有助于所谓“反对国际共产主义的斗争”。
    他在证词里说，“当美国政府考虑中东防御的时候，它是认为这个地区西起利比亚，东至巴基斯坦，北达土耳其，南至阿拉伯半岛。”
