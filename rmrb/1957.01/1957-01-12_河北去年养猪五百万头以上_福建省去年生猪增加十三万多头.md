Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 10th. Hebei Province's pig farming industry achieved great development in 1956, the first year of realizing advanced agricultural cooperativization throughout the province. According to statistics at the end of 1956, the province had raised more than 5,005,000 pigs, an increase of more than 1,160,000 head compared to 1955. In order to encourage the enthusiasm of cooperative members in raising pigs, agricultural cooperatives in Hebei adopted measures such as pricing based on quality, purchasing pig manure with cash or partial cash, selling or providing piglet seedlings to members at low prices or on credit, selling pig feed to members at low prices or distributing it free of charge, and allowing members to raise pigs owned by the cooperative and share profits proportionally. At the same time, in accordance with the principle of "collective breeding and household raising, self-breeding and self-raising, establishing bases, and mutual support," various localities adjusted surpluses and deficiencies, solved the difficulty of lacking piglet seedlings, and laid the foundation for future development of pig farming. By the end of last year, the province had selected and retained more than 464,000 sows, an increase of more than 160,000 head compared to 1955, and selected and retained more than 50,000 breeding boars, an increase of threefold compared to 1955.

In developing pig farming, various localities, especially disaster areas, also mobilized farmers to collect a large number of over 280 kinds of coarse feed substitutes, solving the difficulty of lacking feed for raising pigs. In addition, various localities also paid attention to epidemic prevention work, reducing pig mortality.

This newspaper reports: Fujian Province's hog production achieved rapid development in the second half of last year. According to investigations by relevant departments, there are now more than 2,800,000 hogs in the province, an increase of more than 130,000 head compared to 1955.

In the first half of last year, various localities relaxed their leadership in hog production, and did not provide sufficient care for farmers in terms of prices, feed, and pork supply, which once led to a decline in hog production. In the second half of last year, relevant departments took some effective measures, such as adjusting purchase prices, correcting the tendency to suppress grades and prices, retaining an appropriate amount of pork for self-consumption by pig farmers, and allowing pig farmers to slaughter and consume extra pigs they raised after completing the assigned purchase tasks. Various localities also issued a large number of pig farming loans and feed loans. The province increased the allocation of 60 million jin of feed grain, and combined with the development of rural sideline occupations, restored the production of the rural "five workshops" (rice milling workshop, flour workshop, tofu workshop, mill workshop, red yeast workshop), basically solving the difficulty of insufficient feed, thus enabling hog production to develop.

    河北去年养猪五百万头以上
    福建省去年生猪增加十三万多头
    新华社保定10日电　河北省的养猪业在全省实现高级农业合作化的第一年——1956年获得很大发展。据1956年底的统计，全省已养猪五百万零五千多头，比1955年增加了一百一十六万多头。河北各地农业社为了鼓励社员养猪的积极性，曾采取了以质论价、用现款或部分现款收购猪粪、廉价卖给或赊给社员猪秧、廉价卖给或免价分给社员养猪饲料、社里的猪由社员喂养按比例分红等办法。同时，各地还根据“社繁户养，自繁自养，建立基地，互相支援”的方针，调剂了有无，解决了缺乏猪秧的困难，给今后发展养猪业打下了基础。到去年年底，全省已选留母猪四十六万四千多头，比1955年增加了十六万多头，选留种公猪五万多头，比1955年增加了三倍。
    在发展养猪中，各地特别是灾区还发动农民采集了大量的共有二百八十多种粗饲料代用品，解决了喂猪缺乏饲料的困难。另外，各地也注意了防疫工作，减少了猪的死亡。
    本报讯　福建省的生猪生产去年下半年获得迅速发展。据有关部门调查，全省现有生猪已达二百八十多万头，比1955年增加十三万多头。
    去年上半年，各地放松了生猪生产的领导，在价格、饲料、猪肉供应等方面，对农民照顾不够，因而曾一度造成生猪产量下降。去年下半年，各有关部门采取了一些有效措施，如调整收购价格，纠正压等压级偏向，留给养猪户适量的自食肉，完成派购任务后，养猪户多养的猪可以自宰、自食。各地还发放了大批养猪贷款和饲料贷款。全省增拨了六千万斤饲料粮，结合发展农村副业，恢复了农村五坊（碾米坊、粉坊、豆腐坊、磨坊、红糟坊）生产，基本上解决了饲料不足的困难，因而使生猪生产有所发展。
