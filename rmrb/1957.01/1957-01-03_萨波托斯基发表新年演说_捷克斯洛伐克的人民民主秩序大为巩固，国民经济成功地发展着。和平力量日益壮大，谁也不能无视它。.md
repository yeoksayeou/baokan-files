Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 2nd: According to a report by the Czechoslovak News Agency: On January 1st, President Sapotocky of the Czechoslovak Republic delivered a New Year's broadcast address.

Sapotocky said that experience has proven: warmongers have not abandoned their attempts to launch a new imperialist war, and they have even begun to take blatant military aggression actions. However, it can be stated with satisfaction that the movement against the cruel plunder of the people, against the irresponsible destruction of peace-loving efforts and the fruits of human labor, is so strong that no one can ignore it.

Sapotocky exposed the US's practice of superficially appearing to support a peaceful resolution of problems while actually attempting to solve world problems with a "position of strength."

Sapotocky said that it is precisely because of the stubborn opposition of the United States that People's China—a country with more than 600 million people—has not yet become a member of the United Nations.

President Sapotocky then spoke about the anti-Soviet and anti-communist propaganda launched by the United States with huge amounts of money, analyzed the causes of the Hungarian incident, and expressed the support of the Czechoslovak people for the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government.

He said that our people's democratic order has been greatly consolidated in the past year, and our entire national economy has had successful development, which is beneficial to the people, peace, and socialism.

    萨波托斯基发表新年演说
    捷克斯洛伐克的人民民主秩序大为巩固，国民经济成功地发展着。和平力量日益壮大，谁也不能无视它。
    据新华社布拉格2日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道：1月1日，捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统萨波托斯基发表了新年广播演说。
    萨波托斯基说，经验已经证明：战争贩子并没有放弃发动一次新的帝国主义战争的企图，他们甚至开始采取明目张胆的军事侵略行动。但是，可以满意地指出：反对残酷掠夺人民、反对不负责任地破坏爱好和平的努力和人类劳动的成果的运动已经是如此壮大，以致谁也不能够无视它。
    萨波托斯基揭露了美国表面上似乎是支持和平解决问题而实际上企图以“实力地位”解决世界问题的作法。
    萨波托斯基说，正是由于美国顽固地反对，人民中国——一个拥有六亿多人民的国家，还没有成为联合国的一个会员国。
    萨波托斯基总统接着谈到了美国利用大量金钱发动的反苏反共的宣传，分析了匈牙利事件的原因和捷克斯洛伐克人对于匈牙利工农革命政府的支持。
    他说，我们的人民民主秩序在过去一年中已经大为巩固，我们整个的国民经济有了成功的发展，这是有利于人民、和平和社会主义的。
