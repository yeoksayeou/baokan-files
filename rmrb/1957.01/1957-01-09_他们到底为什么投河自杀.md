Why Did They Commit Suicide by Drowning?
By our reporter Li Ce

Editor's Note: Why did Gong Bingzhang and Huang Daiyu commit suicide by drowning? Obviously, it was because the Party Committee of the Second Engineering Company of the Sichuan Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau, headed by Party Secretary Zhao Shengwu, illegally interfered with their marital autonomy. This interference was already a serious mistake. Unexpectedly, after this led to a suicide incident, the Party Committee not only failed to promptly examine and recognize its errors, but instead found many unwarranted "reasons" to try to shirk its responsibility. This is even more intolerable. As early as the promulgation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a "Notice to the Whole Party on Ensuring the Implementation of the Marriage Law." The notice pointed out that if a Communist Party member engages in acts of interfering with freedom of marriage, and causes injury or death to the interfered person as a result of interfering with freedom of marriage, they should first be subject to Party disciplinary action. However, the Chengdu Municipal Supervisory Committee of the Communist Party of China did not give the relevant personnel the punishment they deserved, but only conducted inspections and issued circulars. How can this be satisfactory?

Gong Bingzhang, an organization cadre of the Party Branch of the Fifth Work Zone of the Second Engineering Company of the Sichuan Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau, and Huang Daiyu, a statistician of the Second Work Zone, committed suicide by drowning together in May of last year because they could not have marital autonomy. Although the matter has passed for more than half a year, it is still a lesson worth remembering for party organizations at all levels.

Gong Bingzhang joined the People's Liberation Army in December 1949, joined the Party in April 1951, and served as a soldier, clerk, and cultural instructor, and was commended several times. In December 1954, he transferred from the troops of the Tibet Military Region to the Second Engineering Company. Huang Daiyu joined the People's Liberation Army in January 1950, served as a nursery worker, received a Third Class Merit, and joined the Communist Youth League in January 1951. She also transferred in December 1954, and came to the company. At that time, they were both in the Fifth Work Zone and began dating in April 1955. In November, the two of them jointly wrote a report to the company's Party Committee applying for marriage.

When the members of the company's Party Committee learned about the love affair, they told Gong Bingzhang that Huang Daiyu's father had been suppressed and her mother was under control, so she was not a suitable marriage partner for a Communist Party member.

Neither national laws nor Party discipline restrict Party members from marrying female Youth League members with poor family backgrounds. When dealing with the marriage issues of Party members, regardless of the social class or who the Party member intends to marry, the Party organization should conduct a concrete analysis. If it believes that it is inappropriate, it only has the right to suggest and advise. In the end, it should act in accordance with the Marriage Law and should not interfere. Gong Bingzhang also put forward reasons why he could marry Huang Daiyu: although Huang Daiyu's family background was landlord, her father was suppressed in 1951. Her mother died when she was three years old, and she grew up in her grandmother's house, so the family had relatively little influence on her. The claim that her "mother was under control" referred to her remarried stepmother, who was already dead. She joined the revolution at the age of sixteen, was commended in the army, and generally performed well in the work zone. She was a member of the Youth League. He believed that he could marry Huang Daiyu and asked the Party Committee not to view her with an unchangeable perspective. However, Comrade Zhao Shengwu, the Secretary of the company's Party Committee, adopted a subjectivist and irresponsible attitude towards the marriage request of Gong Bingzhang and Huang Daiyu from beginning to end. He neither investigated nor researched, nor formally submitted it to the Party Committee for discussion, nor asked for instructions from the higher Party Committee, but subjectively believed that the woman's family background was not good and that she could not marry Party member Gong Bingzhang.

Their application for marriage was not approved for a long time. Huang Daiyu began to suspect that it was probably because of her poor family background. She heard people say that her marriage to Gong Bingzhang was "with ulterior motives" and felt even more pessimistic and disappointed. Gong Bingzhang comforted her on the one hand and actively asked the Party organization to approve his application for marriage on the other. There were six members of the company's Party Committee, and he talked or wrote to five of them one after another. These comrades were indifferent to the marriage issue of this young couple. Some told Gong Bingzhang to "consider it further," while others said they would "study it further." Others said that there were many female comrades, so why did he have to marry Huang Daiyu, or that the company's anti-rebellion movement had begun, so they would talk about it later. The Party Committee never formally discussed this matter once.

Last March, Gong Bingzhang revealed that Huang Daiyu had suicidal thoughts, but some people thought this was their "means of threatening the organization." Gong Bingzhang was forced to write a final letter to Party Secretary Zhao Shengwu and Deputy Secretary Yan Tianjun on April 28. The letter stated: "Before I wrote this letter, my thoughts were intertwined with complex contradictions. On the one hand, I considered writing another letter, and the leaders would feel annoyed, saying that my personal interests were above everything else, that I did not obey the organization, and that I had forgotten the Party's cultivation, etc. On the other hand, I considered not mentioning it, and if an accident happened, it would ruin a comrade's precious life." The letter then specifically explained how Huang Daiyu had suicidal thoughts. The letter requested that they be allowed to marry, and even included words such as "be considerate of our situation," "open a line of hope," and "grant our wish."

However, after receiving this letter, Party Secretary Zhao Shengwu and other members of the Party Committee told Party Committee member Huo Yu to talk to Gong Bingzhang and "educate" him again, telling him to break off his relationship with Huang Daiyu. Then, he called Gong Bingzhang and
"educated" him again. The content of the "education" was still to break off the relationship. Gong Bingzhang saw at the time that the last "line of hope" was completely cut off, and only said:
"If we can't get married, then forget it." Comrade Huo Yu concluded that this "education" had been successful and wrote a note on the letter: Gong Bingzhang "has a preliminary understanding and is willing to educate the woman." He also said: "We must also talk to and educate the woman, and continue to educate Gong." This was considered to be the end of the case. However, before the suicide of this young couple, they neither "talked to and educated the woman" nor "continued to educate Gong." Then they transferred Huang Daiyu from the Fifth Work Zone to the Second Work Zone.

The result of this "education" was that Gong Bingzhang felt desperate and could no longer hide it from Huang Daiyu, so he told her the truth about why they could not get married. A dozen days later, they committed suicide by drowning together outside the South Gate of Chengdu.

Obviously, the subjectivism and bureaucratism of Party Secretary Zhao Shengwu and relevant Party Committee members were important reasons for the suicide of this young couple. Of course, as a Communist Party member, Gong Bingzhang had the right to appeal to the Party Committee at the higher level, up to the Party Central Committee, in accordance with the Party's democratic principles, so as to obtain the support of the higher Party Committee. However, he did not do so, but succumbed to the subjectivists and bureaucrats, and chose the extremely negative path of suicide, which was wrong.

When this young couple committed suicide, the Party Committee had already been re-elected, and the members of the Party Committee had changed, but Party Secretary was still Comrade Zhao Shengwu. At this time, the subjectivist style of Party Secretary Zhao Shengwu and some members of the Party Committee did not diminish, but became even more serious. In the past, they only thought that Huang Daiyu's family background was not good. At this time, in order to reduce their responsibility, they also affirmed that Gong Bingzhang's history also had problems. In the report of the Party Committee to the Chengdu Municipal Supervisory Committee of the Communist Party of China, when talking about the reasons for the suicide of this young couple, it said: "We believe that... on the one hand, it is a political and historical issue, and on the other hand, the woman was pregnant, and would definitely be disgraced and commit mistakes soon, so they committed suicide to cover up the historical issue and reactionary essence, so as to paralyze the masses' sympathy for him, cause dissatisfaction with the Party, damage the Party's prestige, and destroy the relationship between the Party and the masses."

However, whether it is "analysis" or "conclusion," it should be based on facts. Saying that "the woman was pregnant, and would definitely be disgraced and commit mistakes soon" is just an "overly persistent" kind of "speculation." Because only the dead can rise up and explain how much weight this reason accounts for. Saying that another "aspect" of the suicide reason is
"political and historical issues," is to "cover up historical issues and reactionary essence," which is also worth studying. First, let's talk about Huang Daiyu: In addition to saying that her father was suppressed and her mother was a controlled element, the report has a new accusation: she wanted to (go to Mount Emei) to become a sword immortal to avenge her father. Originally, this was what she said on the eve of the liberation of Sichuan (at that time, she was a fifteen-year-old child, and her father had not been suppressed). After she joined the revolution, when she examined her personal and family relationships, she talked about this muddled idea at the time with a self-critical attitude. Saying that she committed suicide to cover up this "historical issue and reactionary essence" would be a miscarriage of justice.

Gong Bingzhang's problem is even more "serious." The report stated: "In 1945, he led a battalion to guard the Kouzi of Jingmen County," "This major historical issue has been concealed from the Party." Thus, it was determined that Gong Bingzhang was "mixed into the Party." This sentence was originally heard from a former long-term worker in Gong Bingzhang's family. Someone who was a colleague with Gong Bingzhang in the reactionary army at the time said that Gong Bingzhang had served as a private, corporal, and then sergeant in 1945 and later. The above facts are completely non-existent.

On the evening of May 22, the Party Committee held an emergency meeting to discuss the handling of the aftermath of the suicide of this young couple. In addition to deciding to write that absurd report to the Municipal Supervisory Committee, it also impatiently suggested that the company's Youth League Committee expel Huang Daiyu from the Youth League the next day, and requested the Municipal Supervisory Committee to immediately approve the expulsion of Gong Bingzhang from the Party and announce the crimes of the suicide of this young couple at a mass meeting. After hearing this, the Municipal Supervisory Committee sent someone the next morning to notify them, saying that Gong Bingzhang's Party membership could not be expelled before his historical issues were clarified, and that it was not in a hurry to announce it to the masses. However, they did not accept this opinion. According to the content of that report, it was announced at a mass meeting in the Fifth Work Zone where Gong Bingzhang was located, and a so-called forum was held in the Second Work Zone where Huang Daiyu was located.

In order to clarify the historical issues of this young couple, the Municipal Supervisory Committee, on the one hand, urged the Party Committee to obtain Gong Bingzhang's archival materials (at that time, Gong's archival materials were still in the Tibet Military Region). On the other hand, it sent someone to conduct an investigation for more than two months together with the Organization Section Chief of the company's Political Department. The investigated materials proved that the suicide of this young couple was not to cover up any "historical issues" or "reactionary essence" as the report said. However, Comrade Zhao Shengwu was very unhappy after hearing this and criticized the comrades who conducted the investigation for having problems with their "views and understanding" and problems with their "standpoint and viewpoint." The Municipal Supervisory Committee requested the company's Party Committee to conduct another inspection, but the company's Party Committee's second report was no different from the first report, except for some differences in wording.

Soon, Gong Bingzhang's archival materials arrived. According to the archival materials, Gong Bingzhang's past explanations of his history and his performance in the army were completely consistent with the materials investigated by the Municipal Supervisory Committee. The company's Party Committee's "analysis" and "conclusions" on the reasons for the suicide of this young couple in the first and second reports all went bankrupt.

At this time, the company's Party Committee wrote a third report to the Municipal Supervisory Committee, examining "bureaucratism," "unclear policy boundaries," etc. It should be said that this was one of the reasons that contributed to the suicide of these two young people. However, the Party Committee's examination of the ideological subjectivism shown by some Party Committee members in handling the marriage issues and suicide aftermath of this young couple was not very thorough.

Now, the Chengdu Municipal Supervisory Committee of the Communist Party of China has dealt with this matter, ordering the relevant personnel to make self-criticisms, without imposing any punishment, and at the same time notifying Party organizations at all levels to learn from it so that future handling of Party members' marriage issues will conform to the Party's principles and national laws.

    他们到底为什么投河自杀
    本报记者　李策
    编者按：龚炳章和黄代玉为什么会投河自杀？显然，是由于以党委书记赵声五为首的中共四川省建筑工程局第二工程公司的党委会非法地干涉了他们的婚姻自主，这种干涉已经十分错误，不料因此造成自杀事件以后，党委会不仅没有及时检查，认识错误，反而找出许多莫须有的“理由”企图推卸自己的责任，这就更加令人不能容忍。远在中华人民共和国婚姻法颁布的同时，中共中央就发出了“关于保证执行婚姻法给全党的通知”，通知中指出，如果共产党员有干涉婚姻自由行为以及因干涉婚姻自由而造成被干涉者的伤害或死亡时，应该首先受到党的纪律制裁。而中共成都市监委会并没有给有关人员以应得的处分，只是检查、通报了事，这怎能令人满意呢？
    四川省建筑工程局第二工程公司第五工区党支部组织干事龚炳章和第二工区统计员黄代玉因为婚姻不能自主，在去年5月份双双投河自杀了，事情虽然已经过去了半年多，但是，对于各级党组织说来，仍然是一个值得记取的教训。
    龚炳章是1949年12月参加解放军的，1951年4月入党，当过战士、文书、文化教员，立过几次功。1954年12月，他从西藏军区部队转业，来到第二工程公司。黄代玉在1950年1月参加解放军，当保育员，立过三等功，1951年1月加入青年团，也是1954年12月转业，来到公司的。当时，他们都在五工区，从1955年4月开始恋爱。11月两人一起给公司党委会写了申请结婚的报告。
    公司党委委员们知道了恋爱这件事，就告诉龚炳章说，黄代玉父亲被镇压、母亲被管制，不是共产党员恋爱的对象。
    无论国家法律或是党的纪律，都没有限制党员跟家庭成份不好的女团员结婚的规定。党的组织在处理党员的婚姻问题时，无论党员的结婚对象是什么成份，什么人，都应当具体分析，如果认为不妥，也只有建议和劝说的权利，最后按婚姻法办事，不应该加以干涉。龚炳章也提出过可以跟黄代玉结婚的理由：黄代玉家庭成份虽然是地主，她的父亲在1951年被镇压了，她三岁就死了母亲，是在外婆家里长大的，家庭给她的影响比较小。说她的“母亲被管制”，那是她的改嫁了的后母，已经死去。她十六岁参加革命，在部队上立过功，在工区一般表现较好，是个团员。他认为可以跟黄代玉结婚，要求党委不要用一成不变的眼光看待她。但是，公司党委书记赵声五同志，对待龚炳章和黄代玉要求结婚问题，从始至终一直采取了主观主义的不负责任的态度，既不调查研究，也不正式提交党委会讨论，又不请示上级党委，而主观主义地认为女方家庭成份不好，不能跟党员龚炳章结婚。
    他们申请结婚的报告迟迟批不下来，黄代玉开始怀疑了，想到恐怕是因为自己家庭成份不好，又听人们说她要跟龚炳章结婚，是“别有用心”，就更感到悲观失望。龚炳章一面安慰她，一面积极向党组织要求批准他的申请结婚报告。公司党委有六个委员，他先后跟五个委员谈过话或写过信。这些同志对这对青年的婚姻问题漠不关心，不是叫龚炳章再“考虑、考虑”，就是说我们再“研究、研究”。或者说女同志多得很，为什么一定要跟黄代玉结婚，或者说公司肃反运动开始了，以后再说吧。对这件事，党委会从来没有正式讨论过一次。
    龚炳章去年3月透露了黄代玉有自杀的念头，有人却又认为这是他们“威胁组织的手段”。龚炳章迫不得已，在4月28日给党委书记赵声五、副书记燕天俊写了最后一封信。信上说：“我写这封信以先，思想上交织着错综复杂的矛盾，一会考虑到又写信，领导上会感到厌烦的，会说我个人利益高于一切，不服从组织，忘掉党的培养等等。又考虑到不提吧，一出意外，就断送了一个同志宝贵的生命。”信里接着具体说明了黄代玉怎样产生了自杀的念头。信上要求批准他们结婚，甚至有这样的话：“体贴我们的处境”，“开一线之路”，“成全我们”。
    可是，党委书记赵声五同志和党委会其他委员接到这封信，竟叫党委委员霍裕同志找龚炳章谈话，再“教育”他一番，跟黄代玉断绝关系。于是，他又把龚炳章叫来
  “教育”了一通，“教育”内容，还是断绝关系。龚炳章当时看出最后“一线之路”完全断绝了，只是说：
  “不能结婚就算啦。”霍裕同志竟断定这番“教育”成功了，就在信上批注：龚炳章“有了初步认识，愿意教育女方”。又说：“我们还须与女的谈话教育，并继续教育龚。”这样就算结束了一件公案。可是，他们在这对青年自杀以前，既没有“与女的谈话教育”，也没有“继续教育龚”。接着又把黄代玉从五工区调到二工区去了。
    这番“教育”的结果是，龚炳章感到绝望了，再不能继续向黄代玉隐瞒下去了，于是说出了他们不能结婚的真情实况。他们在十几天以后，一同在成都市南门外投河自杀了。
    显然，党委书记赵声五和有关党委委员的主观主义和官僚主义是造成这对青年自杀的重要原因。当然龚炳章作为一个共产党员，按照党的民主原则，有权利向上一级党委，直到党的中央申诉，以便得到上级党委的支持；可是他没有这样做，却在主观主义和官僚主义者们的面前屈服了，选择了极端消极的自杀的道路，这是错误的。
    这对青年自杀时，党委会已经改选了，党委委员有了变动，但党委书记还是赵声五同志。这时，党委书记赵声五和一些党委委员的主观主义作风没有收敛，反而更加严重了。他们过去还只是认为黄代玉的家庭成份不好，这时，为了减轻自己的责任，又肯定龚炳章的历史也有问题了。党委会给中共成都市监委的报告上，谈到这对青年自杀的原因时说：“我们认为……一方面是政治历史问题，另一方面是女方身怀有孕，不久一定出丑，犯错误，因而发生自杀，来掩盖历史问题以及反动本质，达到麻痹群众对他的同情，对党不满，损害党的威信，破坏党和群众的关系”。
    但是，无论“分析”也好，“结论”也好，都应该以事实做根据。说“女方身怀有孕，不久一定出丑，犯错误”，这只是“过于执”式的“揣摩推测”。因为这个原因究竟占多大的比重，只有死人站起来，才能交代清楚。说自杀原因的另“一方面”是
  “政治历史问题”，是为“掩盖历史问题以及反动本质”，也是值得研究的。先说黄代玉：报告上除了说她父亲被镇压，母亲是管制分子而外，又有条新的罪状：她想（上峨眉山）当剑仙替父亲报仇。原来这话是她在四川解放前夕（那时，她是十五岁的小孩子，她父亲并没有被镇压），受了反动宣传时讲的。她参加革命后，检查个人和家庭关系时，以自我批评的态度，谈出来那时这种糊涂想法。说她自杀也是为了掩盖这个“历史问题以及反动本质”，岂不冤枉。
    龚炳章的问题就更“严重”了。报告上说：“1945年，他带领一营人守住荆门县口子”，“这重大历史问题，一直向党隐瞒”。于是判定龚炳章是“混进党内来的”。这句话原来是听龚炳章过去家里的一个长工讲的。有个跟龚炳章当时在反动军队中同事的人，却说龚炳章在1945年和以后，先后当过下士、中士、直到上士。上述事实是根本没有的。
    5月22日晚上，党委举行紧急会议，讨论处理这对青年自杀的善后问题，除决定给市监委写了那份荒唐的报告外，又迫不及待地建议公司团委在第二天开除黄代玉的团籍，要求市监委马上批准开除龚炳章的党籍，并在群众大会上公布这对青年自杀的罪状。市监委听说以后，第二天早上派人通知他们，说在龚炳章的历史问题未弄清楚以前，不能开除他的党籍，也不忙向群众公布。但是，他们没有接受这个意见。按照那份报告的内容，在龚炳章所在的五工区群众大会上宣布了，又在黄代玉所在的二工区举行了所谓座谈会。
    市监委为了弄清这对青年的历史问题，一面督促党委要龚炳章的档案材料（那时，龚的档案材料还在西藏军区）。一面派人会同公司政治处组织科长进行了两个多月的调查。调查的材料证明这对青年自杀，并不像报告上所说的，是掩盖什么“历史问题”和“反动本质”。但赵声五同志听了很不高兴，却批评调查的同志“看法上、认识上”有问题，“立场观点”有问题。市监委要求公司党委再作一次检查，但公司党委的第二份报告，跟第一份报告比较，除了文字有所不同，内容没有两样。
    不久，龚炳章的档案材料来了。从档案材料上看，龚炳章过去在部队上交代的历史和他的表现，跟市监委调查的材料，完全相符。公司党委在第一、第二两份报告里，对于这对青年自杀原因的“分析”和作出的“结论”，全部破产了。
    这时，公司党委又给市监委写了第三份报告，检查“官僚主义”、“政策界限不清”等等。应该说，这是促成这两个青年投河自杀的种种原因之一。但，党委对某些党委委员在处理这对青年婚姻问题、自杀善后问题所表现出来的思想上的主观主义，检查得却很不深刻。
    现在，中共成都市监察委员会已对此事作了处理，责成有关人员作了检讨，没有给予处分，同时通报各级党组织，要求从中吸取教训，以便今后在处理党员婚姻问题上符合党的原则和国家法律。
