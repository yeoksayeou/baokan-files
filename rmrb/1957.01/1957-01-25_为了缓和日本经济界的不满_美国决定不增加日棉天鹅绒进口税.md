    To Ease the Dissatisfaction of the Japanese Economic Circles
    The United States Decided Not to Increase Import Taxes on Japanese Cotton Velvet
    Xinhua News Agency, January 24th – U.S. President Eisenhower rejected the U.S. Tariff Commission's recommendation on the 22nd to increase import taxes on Japanese cotton velvet. Eisenhower's decision was made after Japan "voluntarily limited" its cotton velvet exports to the United States to 2.5 million square yards per year.
    To restrict imports of Japanese cotton textiles, the U.S. Tariff Commission suggested in October of last year to increase import taxes on Japanese cotton velvet by 25% to 30%. This suggestion aroused strong opposition from Japan. After Japan reached an agreement with the United States on the 16th regarding limiting Japanese textile exports to the United States, Japanese officials in Washington warned the United States that if Eisenhower approved the increase in import taxes on Japanese velvet, it could undermine the agreement of the 16th. They said that Japan had the right to cancel the "voluntary restriction" measures at any time.
    While welcoming the U.S. President's decision, Tsuneo Komuro, Director of the Textile Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, pointed out that this decision does not mean that all textile-related issues between Japan and the United States have been resolved. He said that some places in the United States are still boycotting Japanese cotton textiles. In addition to South Carolina and Alabama, the Georgia State Legislature also passed a law on January 16th to boycott Japanese textiles.

### 为了缓和日本经济界的不满  美国决定不增加日棉天鹅绒进口税

    为了缓和日本经济界的不满
    美国决定不增加日棉天鹅绒进口税
    新华社24日讯　美国总统艾森豪威尔在22日拒绝了美国关税委员会要求增加日本棉天鹅绒的进口税的建议。艾森豪威尔的这个决定是在日本把它向美国出口的棉天鹅绒的数量“自动限制”为一年二百五十万平方码以后作出的。
    为了限制日本棉织品的进口，美国关税委员会在去年10月就建议增加日本棉天鹅绒的进口税25％至30％。这个建议引起了日本方面的强烈反对。日本在16日同美国就限制日本棉织品输往美国的问题达成协议以后，驻华盛顿的日本官员们就警告美国说，如果艾森豪威尔批准增加日本天鹅绒的进口税，可能会破坏16日的协议。他们说，日本在任何时候都有权把“自动限制”的措施取消。
    日本通商产业省纤维局长小室恒夫在欢迎美国总统的决定的同时指出，这个决定并不意味着日美两国之间所有关于纺织品的问题都已经解决了。他说，美国的一些地方仍在抵制日本棉织品，除了南加罗来纳和亚拉巴马州以外，佐治亚州州议会也在1月16日通过了抵制日本纺织品的法令。
