    In Liangping County, Sichuan Province, some district and township leaders did not allocate sufficient manpower, and only 530,000 yuan of the 1.08 million yuan in agricultural loans due last year had been recovered by early November. This is largely related to the arbitrary transfer of credit cooperative cadres by county and township administrative leaders. According to statistics from the Liangping People's Bank, out of 153 credit cooperative cadres in the county, 20 were transferred by Party and government departments to work on central tasks; 86 were fixed to villages; and 39 accountants were doing internal accounting work; leaving only 8 people actually engaged in the main business. For example, the Xinshui District Committee stipulated in its busy season work instructions: "Credit cooperatives with two cadres will have one drawn; those with three will have two drawn; those with four will have three drawn." The bank business office disagreed with this practice, but was criticized for "the business office not obeying the leadership of the district committee." The Fulu District Shian Township General Branch fixed credit cooperative cadre Tan Zuowen to the village to establish an advanced cooperative, and also asked him to be responsible for the business of four villages, resulting in the recovery of only nine yuan in loans. More seriously, the Pingjin District transferred credit cooperative cadres to work on private reform for more than two months. Renxian District Mingda Township convened an enlarged meeting of village cadres, and when there was a shortage of people to manage meals, they also drew people from the credit cooperative. This arbitrary transfer of credit cooperative cadres not only seriously affected the development of rural financial work during the busy season, but also caused the credit cooperative cadres to feel ideologically distressed and not at ease with rural financial work. Zhu Xiaofu, a cadre of the Baijia Credit Cooperative, believes that this is a "suffering from both sides" job, and he even asked to go home to engage in production.
    I believe this situation is serious, and I hope that the leading departments of Liangping County will immediately stop the practice of arbitrarily transferring credit cooperative cadres, and let them quickly return to their work posts.

    In some counties and townships in Hunan, leading institutions arbitrarily transfer credit cooperative cadres to manage meals. The General Branch Secretary and Township Head of Taipan Temple Township in Dong'an County decided that the township credit cooperative accountant should manage meals. Once, the accountant was attending a business meeting at the local bank business office, and the township needed someone to manage meals due to the convening of a general election meeting, so they called the business office to urge the accountant to return immediately to manage meals. For example, in Yuanjiang County, there were seventeen credit cooperative accountants, and ten of them were drawn to be fixed to manage meals for the township people's committee.
    The credit cooperative accountant has to spend a large part of his time entangled in meal work, unable to manage his own accounts well, let alone have time to develop deposit and loan business in the area, affecting the credit cooperative's credibility among the masses.

    不要随便抽调信用社干部
              （一）
    四川省梁平县部分区乡领导未适当安排力量，全县应收回的一百零八万元到期农业贷款到去年11月上旬只收回五十三万元。这同县、乡行政领导部门随意抽调信用社干部有很大关系。据梁平人民银行统计，全县一百五十三个信用社干部中被党政部门调去二十个搞中心工作；有八十六个社干被固定到村；还有三十九个会计作内部账务工作；而真正搞本行业务的只有八个人。如新盛区区委在旺季工作指示中规定：“有两个社干的信用社抽一个；三个的抽两个；四个的抽三个。”银行营业所不同意这种作法，反被批评“营业所不服从区委领导。”福禄区石安乡总支，把信用社干部谭作文固定到村里建立高级社，又要他担负四个村的业务，结果只收了九元贷款。更严重的是屏锦区把信用社干部调去搞私改工作两个多月。仁贤区明达乡召开村扩大干部会，缺少管伙食的，也要从信用社里抽人。这种随便抽调信用社干部的作法不仅严重地影响了旺季农村金融工作的开展，也造成信用社干部思想上的苦闷而不安心农村金融工作。柏家信用社干部朱孝福认为这是“两头受气”的工作，他并且要求回家生产。
    我认为这一情况是严重的，希望梁平县领导部门立即制止随便抽调信用社干部的作法，并且让他们迅速返回自己的工作岗位。

    湖南有些县和乡的领导机构随便抽调信用社干部管伙食。东安县台盘寺乡总支书和乡长决定该乡信用社会计管伙食。有一次会计正在当地银行营业所参加业务会议，乡里由于召开普选会议，需要管伙食的人，便打电话至营业所催会计马上回来管伙食。又如沅江县有十七个信用社会计，被抽出固定管乡人民委员会伙食的就有十个。
    信用社会计要付出很大一部分时间纠缠在伙食工作上，无法管理好本身的账务，更没有时间开展本地区的存、放款业务，影响了信用社在群众中的信誉。　　　岳扬
