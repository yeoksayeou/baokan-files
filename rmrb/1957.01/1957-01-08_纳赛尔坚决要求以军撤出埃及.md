Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 7th - According to Cairo newspapers today, President Nasser said in his reply to King Hussein of Jordan on the 5th that Egypt firmly and unwaveringly demands the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops from Egyptian territory.

Hussein's letter to Nasser was brought to Nasser by a special Jordanian delegation presenting the highest Jordanian medal to Port Said. Hussein's letter praised Port Said as a symbol of all Arab countries. He emphasized that all Arabs should work together to "force Israel, the tool of imperialism, to withdraw unconditionally from the Gaza Strip."

President Nasser said in his reply that the Egyptian people and the Egyptian army, in their resolute struggle, believe that they are defending not only the prestige of Egypt, but also the prestige of the entire Arab nation, which the imperialists are trying to degrade.

    纳赛尔坚决要求以军撤出埃及
    新华社开罗7日电　据开罗报纸今天报道，纳赛尔总统5日在给约旦国王侯赛尼的复信中说，埃及坚定不移地要求以色列军队无条件地撤出埃及领土。
    侯赛尼给纳赛尔的信是由向塞得港赠送约旦最高勋章的约旦特别代表团带给纳赛尔的。侯赛尼的信中曾经赞扬塞得港是全体阿拉伯国家的象征。他着重说，一切阿拉伯人都应当共同努力来“迫使帝国主义的工具以色列无条件地撤出加沙地带”。
    纳赛尔总统在他的复信中说，埃及人民和埃及军队在他们坚决进行斗争的时候认为，他们所保卫的不仅是埃及的威信，而且也是帝国主义者所力图贬低的整个阿拉伯民族的威信。
