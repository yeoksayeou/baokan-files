Moscow, January 13 (reported by this newspaper) – The Soviet Union achieved great success in oil production in 1956. All kinds of oil production overfulfilled the plan ahead of schedule. The annual oil production reached 84 million tons, an increase of 18.5% compared with 1955. This was stated by Ozotzhev, Deputy Minister of the Soviet Oil Industry Department, when he met with reporters from this newspaper.

Ozotzhev said: The rapid increase in Soviet oil production in the first year of the Sixth Five-Year Plan is inseparable from the large-scale development of oil areas in the Soviet East. At present, the Soviet oil production center has gradually shifted to the east, and the output in the eastern region accounted for 70% of the total Soviet oil output in 1956. In 1956, the Tatar Autonomous Republic increased oil production by 4.7 million tons; the Bashkir Autonomous Republic increased production by 3.6 million tons; and the Kuibyshev Oblast increased production by 3.6 million tons. At the same time, oil production in the new oil-producing areas in eastern Soviet Union—Krasnoyarsk Krai, Molotov Oblast, etc.—also increased significantly. According to exploration results, oil exploitation in the eastern region of the Soviet Union has broad prospects. Baku, the famous oil-producing area in the southern Soviet Union, also increased its output in 1956. The resolution of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out that the output of the Baku oil area should reach 15.55 million tons in 1960, but according to the output situation in the area last year, it is expected that this production level can be reached this year.

Ozotzhev added: Advanced technology has been widely used in Soviet oil production, which has greatly helped increase production. At present, tracer atoms and new radio electrical surveying methods have been used in oil exploration, excavation, drilling, and oil processing. 62% of the total Soviet oil production used peripheral and internal water injection oil recovery methods.

Ozotzhev finally said: The Soviet Oil Industry Department and the Chinese Ministry of Petroleum Industry have established good relations. The Soviet Oil Industry Department is happy to assist in the construction of China's petroleum industry. A large number of Chinese interns are interning in the Soviet Central Asian oil-producing areas. A large number of equipment for oil wells and processing plants are being shipped to Xinjiang and other places. This year, the supply of oil extraction and oil processing machinery to China will also be expanded.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 14th: According to TASS, the Soviet coal mining industry mined 430 million tons of coal last year, an increase of nearly 40 million tons compared to 1955.

The large increase in coal mining is primarily due to the adoption of new technological equipment in the coal mining industry. At present, there are nearly 70,000 different machines in coal mining enterprises. Last year, thousands of coal cutters, scraper conveyors, belt conveyors, and electric locomotives were supplied for miners to use. The labor of coal miners in many coal mines and open-pit mines has been completely mechanized. Last year, sixty-six highly mechanized coal mines and open-pit mines were put into production. The entire production process of these enterprises is carried out by machines.

This year, the number of fully mechanized coal mines and open-pit mines will increase further. In Donbass, Kuzbass, Karaganda, and other coal mining areas, more than one hundred coal mining enterprises will be put into production this year, and these enterprises can produce several million tons of coal annually.

By the end of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union's annual coal output will reach 600 million tons.

    苏联燃料工业的新成就
    去年生产石油达八千四百万吨，采煤四亿三千万吨
    本报莫斯科13日电　1956年苏联石油生产取得了很大成就。各种石油生产都提前超额完成了计划。全年生产石油达八千四百万吨，即比1955年产量增加了18.5％。这是苏联石油工业部副部长奥佐特热夫在接见本报记者时说的。
    奥佐特热夫说：第六个五年计划第一年里，苏联石油产量迅速提高，这是和苏联东部石油地区的大规模开发分不开的。目前，苏联的石油生产中心已逐渐移向东部，东部地区1956年的产量已占全苏石油产量的70％。1956年鞑靼自治共和国石油增产了四百七十万吨；巴什基里亚自治共和国增产三百六十万吨；古比雪夫州增产了三百六十万吨。同时，东部石油新产区——克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区、莫洛托夫州等地的石油产量也显著增加。根据勘探结果，苏联东部地区的石油开采有着广阔的前途。苏联南方著名的石油产地巴库，1956年的产量也提高了。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议指出，巴库油区在1960年的产量应该达到一千五百五十五万吨，但根据去年该区产量的情形，预计在今年就能达到这个生产水平。
    奥佐特热夫又说：苏联石油生产已广泛地应用了先进技术，这大大帮助了产量的提高。目前，在石油探测、掘进、钻孔、石油加工等方面已使用了示踪原子和新式的无线电电测法。全苏62％的石油产量使用了外围和内线注水采油法。
    奥佐特热夫最后说：苏联石油工业部和中国石油工业部已经建立了很好的联系，苏联石油工业部高兴援助中国石油工业的建设。大批的中国实习生正在苏联中亚石油产区实习。石油矿井和加工工厂的大量设备运往新疆等地。今年还将扩大对中国供应的石油开采和石油加工的机器。
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联的煤矿工业去年采煤四亿三千万吨，比1955年增加将近四千万吨。
    采煤量有这样大的增长首先是因为在采煤业中采用了新的技术设备。现在在采煤企业中有将近七万台各种不同的机器。去年有几千台截煤机、刮板运输机、皮带运输机和电气机车供应矿工使用。许多煤井和露天矿场中采煤工人的劳动已经完全机械化了。去年有六十六个高度机械化的煤井和露天矿场投入生产。这些企业的全部生产过程都是用机械进行的。
    今年，完全机械化的煤井和露天矿场还要增加。在顿巴斯、库兹巴斯、卡拉干达和其他采煤区，今年将有一百多个采煤企业投入生产，这些企业每年可以生产几百万吨煤。
    到第六个五年计划结束时，苏联煤的年产量将能达到六亿吨。
