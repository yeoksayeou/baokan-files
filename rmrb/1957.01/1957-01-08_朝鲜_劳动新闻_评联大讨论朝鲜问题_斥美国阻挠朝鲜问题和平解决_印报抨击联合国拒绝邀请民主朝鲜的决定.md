Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 6th: The Korean "Labor News" today published a commentary entitled "The Korean Question Should Be Resolved According to the Will of the Korean People," stating that the Korean people regret that the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began its discussion of the Korean question without the participation of representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and believe that discussions conducted under these circumstances cannot fairly resolve the Korean question.

The commentary pointed out that the Korean question is a pressing and ripe issue that urgently needs to be resolved. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea adheres to its consistent position that the Korean question should be resolved in accordance with the national interests of the Korean people and the interests of world peace and security, and believes that it can be resolved. We unanimously advocate that, without foreign interference, genuine all-Korean general elections should be held based on the will of the people of North and South Korea, and that a unified, democratic central government should be established to realize the unification of Korea. To this end, all foreign troops must simultaneously withdraw from North and South Korea before the general elections.

The commentary emphasized that, under the current circumstances, the most important thing for peacefully resolving the Korean question is to establish and develop connections between North and South Korea to discuss practical ways to peacefully unify Korea. The commentary stated that the Republic has repeatedly proposed suggestions for North-South consultation and will continue to work towards this end.

"Labor News" emphasized that, however, the United States and the Syngman Rhee group have been obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean question. They are frantically expanding the Syngman Rhee army, constantly violating the armistice agreement, and openly clamoring for the abolition of the armistice agreement. All of these actions stem from an attempt to permanently divide Korea, obstruct the resolution of the Korean question, and provoke war. The many proposals put forward by the Republic for the peaceful reunification of Korea and for conducting North-South consultations have not been realized due to the sabotage of the United States and Syngman Rhee, and they must bear full responsibility for delaying Korean unification.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 5th: The "Indian Express" today criticized the decision of the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly to refuse India's proposal to invite representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the discussion of the Korean question. It said: "The representative of Ceylon is absolutely correct in believing that the United Nations must abandon its sectarian attitude and disregard of North Korea."

The editorial of the Hindi newspaper "Hindustan Daily" said: "The attitude taken by the United States in this regard does nothing to help resolve the issue of Korean unification." The newspaper said that although, according to the Indian Prime Minister, the United States' policy is "flexible," it is currently "very clear that the United States is not even prepared to deviate slightly from the approach it has always taken in international affairs."

"Hindustan Daily" argued: "The United Nations should bring together representatives from North Korea and South Korea and, through its own mediation, help to formulate a mutually agreed solution to the issue of Korean unification."

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”评联大讨论朝鲜问题
    斥美国阻挠朝鲜问题和平解决
    印报抨击联合国拒绝邀请民主朝鲜的决定
    新华社平壤6日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表题为“朝鲜问题应当按照朝鲜人民的意志来解决”的评论说，联合国大会政治委员会在没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加的情况下开始了关于朝鲜问题的讨论，朝鲜人民对此表示遗憾，并且认为在这种情况下进行的讨论不可能公正解决朝鲜问题。
    评论指出，朝鲜问题是急需迅速解决的、成熟了的问题，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府坚持它的一贯的立场，这就是朝鲜问题应该按照朝鲜人民的民族利益和全世界和平安全的利益来解决，并且认为是能够解决的。我们一致主张，要在没有外国干涉的条件下，根据南北朝鲜人民的意志举行真正的全朝鲜的总选举，建立统一的民主的中央政府，来实现朝鲜的统一。为此，一切外国军队必须在总选举以前同时撤出南北朝鲜。
    评论强调说，在目前的情况下，为了和平解决朝鲜问题最重要的是，建立并发展南北朝鲜的联系，以商讨和平统一朝鲜的切实可行的途径。评论说，共和国方面曾经多次提出关于南北协商的建议，并且将为此而继续努力。
    “劳动新闻”着重指出，但是，美国和李承晚集团一直在阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。它们疯狂地扩充李承晚军队，不断违反停战协定，并且公然叫嚣废除停战协定。这一切的行动，都是从企图永久分裂朝鲜、阻挠朝鲜问题的解决和挑起战争出发的。共和国方面提出的许多和平统一朝鲜和进行南北协商的建议也都由于美国和李承晚的破坏而没有能够实现，它们必须完全负起推迟朝鲜统一的责任。
    新华社新德里5日电　“印度快报”今天批评联合国大会政治委员会拒绝印度提出的邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加朝鲜问题的讨论的建议。它说：“锡兰代表认为联合国必须抛弃它的宗派态度和无视北朝鲜的做法，这是完全正确的。”
    印地文报纸“印度斯坦日报”的社论说：“美国在这方面采取的态度丝毫无助于解决朝鲜统一问题。”这家报纸说，虽然据印度总理说美国的政策是“灵活的”，但是目前“很显然，美国甚至一点也不准备稍稍离开它在国际事务方面一向采取的方针。”
    “印度斯坦日报”主张：“联合国应该使北朝鲜和南朝鲜的代表聚集到一起，通过它自己的调停来帮助拟定关于朝鲜统一问题的大家一致同意的解决办法。”
