Xinhua News Agency, London, January 12th: According to TASS, the Political Committee of the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement regarding the British government reshuffle.

The statement said that the new Prime Minister, Macmillan, is a representative of the extreme right wing of the Conservative Party. Macmillan was an active supporter of the military adventure against Egypt, which brought devastating consequences to Britain. During his tenure as Chancellor of the Exchequer, he implemented measures that lowered the people's living standards.

The Political Committee called for uniting all forces of the workers' movement and put forward some demands in terms of foreign and domestic policies, such as demanding that British troops withdraw from Cyprus, Kenya, and Malaya; demanding high-level negotiations between major powers to discuss peace, disarmament, and genuine security; demanding the resumption of trade between East and West; demanding an end to the dismissal of workers and the transfer of workers to part-time work weeks; demanding a reduction in the purchase tax on the most essential goods and the restoration of subsidies to reduce food prices; demanding an increase in social insurance benefits and support for workers' demands for higher wages; and demanding a reduction of half of the defense expenditure and shortening the term of military service.

The statement said that in view of the government crisis, the Political Committee firmly advocates holding parliamentary elections as soon as possible.
