Workers and Peasants Heart to Heart

The Spring Festival is approaching. The Wuhan Metallurgical Construction General Company and its ten-plus engineering companies have organized batches of responsible cadres who will soon visit the rural areas surrounding the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex construction site. They will also invite guests from agricultural cooperatives to the construction site to celebrate the Spring Festival with the builders.

As the builders joyfully welcome the festival, they once again recall the warm support of the peasants near the construction site for the construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel.

Last winter, the start date for the Wuhan Iron and Steel's auxiliary repair facility—the steel casting workshop—was approaching. However, the foundation of this factory building was located in a depression more than ten meters deep, with more than two meters of accumulated water inside. At that time, there were no water pumps on the construction site, and it seemed that the progress of the project would be affected. When the nearby peasants learned of this, they immediately sent six waterwheels to the construction site and dispatched more than twenty people to help pump water, and it only took one day to pump the accumulated water out of the factory foundation.

In August last year, the water supply pipe had not yet been connected to the metal structure factory construction site, and it was difficult for the builders to even get drinking water. Although the rural areas were experiencing a drought at the time, they still gave up one of the two drinking water ponds for the construction site to use.

The open-air assembly yard project of the metal structure factory faced a labor shortage in early November last year, and it was difficult to complete the earthwork project on schedule. At this time, several agricultural production cooperatives near the construction site dispatched more than one hundred laborers to help the construction site complete the construction plan, ensuring the progress of the project. At the same time, some rural women also enthusiastically took care of the children of the neighboring construction workers during the day, and braved the cold winter mornings to boil hot water for the builders to wash their faces and mouths.

The peasants near the Wuhan Iron and Steel construction site also appreciated the care given to them by the builders. Many construction sites invited peasants to watch movies and evening performances. Last winter, some ponds in the rural areas dried up, and some construction sites installed tap water faucets for the peasants. Each construction site also provided a large amount of manure free of charge to nearby agricultural production cooperatives to support agricultural production.

The Wuhan Iron and Steel construction site is connected to forty-seven agricultural production cooperatives. In October last year, the Wuhan Metallurgical Construction General Company specially established a worker-peasant alliance committee together with the local people's government, and each engineering company and nearby agricultural production cooperative also successively established nine worker-peasant alliance branches. The friendly relationship between the Wuhan Iron and Steel construction workers and the nearby peasants has become increasingly close with the progress of the construction project.

    工人农民心连心
    春节快要到了。武汉冶金建筑总公司和它的十多个工程公司，已经组织了成批的负责干部，即将到武汉钢铁联合企业工地四围的农村去访问；还将邀请农业合作社的客人到工地同建筑者一道欢度春节。
    当建筑者们喜气洋洋地迎接佳节的时候，他们再一次忆起工地附近农民对武钢建设的盛情支援。
    去年冬末，武钢的一次辅助修理设施——铸钢车间的开工日期逼近了。但是这个厂房地基处在一个十多公尺深的洼地，里边还有两公尺多深的积水。当时工地上没有抽水机，眼看就要影响工程进度。这件事被附近农民知道了，他们立即抽出六部水车送到工地，并且派了二十多人到工地帮助车水，只用一天时间就车干了这个厂基里的积水。
    去年8月，给水管还没有同金属结构厂工地连接起来，建筑者连吃水也很困难。当时农村虽然正逢干旱，也还是把两个吃水塘让出一个给工地用。
    金属结构厂的露天装配场工程，在去年11月初劳动力不足，按期完成土方工程有困难。这时，工地附近的几个农业生产合作社就抽出一百多个劳动力，帮助工地完成了建设计划，保证了工程进度。同时，工地附近有些农妇白天还热情地替邻居的建筑职工照看孩子，并且冒着冬晨寒冷给建筑者们烧热水洗脸漱口。
    武钢工地附近的农民，也感激建设者给他们的照顾。很多工地邀请农民观看电影和晚会演出；去年冬季农村有些水塘旱干了，有的工地替农民安装了自来水龙头；各个工地都免费供给附近农业生产合作社大量粪肥，支援农业生产。
    武钢工地四周同四十七个农业生产合作社相连。去年10月，武汉冶金建筑总公司特地同当地人民政府成立了一个工农联盟委员会，各工程公司同附近农业生产合作社也相继成立了九个工农联盟分会。武钢建筑职工同附近农民的友谊关系，随着建设工程的进展已经日益亲密起来了。　　（据新华社）
