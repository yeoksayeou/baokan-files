Folk Tale:

    Outside an ancient county town, there was a deep gully with a small stream. Over this gully stood a large stone bridge. The stones used to build this bridge were all of the same snow-white color. This type of stone came from a large mountain hundreds of miles away from the county town. On top of the stone railings on both sides of the stone bridge, some were carved with delicate small stone lions, while others were carved with figures, flowers, and plants, showing how much effort was spent at the time.

    In the early years, this deep gully was just a narrow ditch, without even a single-plank bridge, let alone this large stone bridge. Back then, although the gully wasn't deep and the water wasn't big, it was impossible to stride across in one step. People passing by, whether empty-handed or carrying loads, had to take off their shoes to cross. In winter, the cold water would chill them to the bone. Not far from this crossroads, beside the gully, there was a strange stone, which the locals called the "Immortal Stone." This Immortal Stone looked just like an old man lying there, and if you looked closely, you could even see his eyebrows, eyes, and beard. Some people said that this Immortal Stone had transformed into an immortal twice, because two similar yet different things had happened on this small gully. At that time, there was a lonely and poor young man who had no land or property. He went up the mountain to chop firewood every day and crossed this small gully every day, always seeing people struggling to cross. One day, he chopped a large load of firewood and, when he reached the small gully, looked at the narrow stream and thought: So many people pass by here every day, it’s so inconvenient without a bridge to step on! I’ll use this load of firewood to make a temporary bridge; at least it will make things easier for a few days. Although he was a little reluctant, he still filled the water in the gully with his load of firewood. People could now step on the firewood to cross without getting their shoes wet. Everyone who passed by praised him, saying, "Who built this bridge here? It's so good, it makes things much easier for people!"

    The young man also crossed his own bridge every day. After a few days, he had almost forgotten about it. One day at noon, he was passing by when he saw the Immortal Stone suddenly move. Oh! It sat up. It was no longer a stone but a real old man. The old man walked up to him and said kindly, "Young man, I have been here for a thousand years. I made two great wishes. If I personally hear someone being praised a hundred times by others, I will bestow riches and honor upon him. The first wish has come true on you." As the old man spoke, he pointed his finger, and a wide road appeared in front of him. On the road, a sedan carried by eight men, with a county magistrate wearing a gauze hat inside, shimmered into view. The old man said:
    “Do you see that clearly? You will be like this soon.” The old man waved his hand, and the road and the eight-man sedan disappeared. The young man asked with envy and doubt, "I can't read; how can I become a county magistrate?" The old man patted him on the shoulder and said, "Young man, don't worry about that at all. Just go to the examination hall with confidence. I have a few taels of silver here. Take them as travel expenses."

    The old man handed the silver to the young man and lay down again beside the gully, immediately turning back into stone.

    With the silver, the young man bought clothes and luggage and entered the examination hall. When he picked up the pen, it seemed to move on its own, and the paper was quickly filled with writing. Sure enough, he passed the first examination and became a Xiucai (successful candidate in the imperial examination). He was very pleased and packed his luggage to go to the capital. He passed another examination and became a Juren (successful candidate in the provincial imperial examination), and then another examination and became a Jinshi (successful candidate in the highest imperial examination). An imperial decree was issued, appointing him as the county magistrate of his own county. The young man returned to his hometown to take office in a sedan carried by eight men, in great pomp and circumstance. He truly enjoyed inexhaustible riches and honor, grew tired of eating fresh fish and meat, and grew weary of wearing silk and satin. He thought: Just by building a bridge with a load of firewood, I received such riches and honor. If I build a big bridge, who knows what blessings I will enjoy?

    So he ordered people to gather all the able-bodied men in the county. Some were sent to the mountains hundreds of miles away to quarry the snow-white stones, while others widened the small gully there. This was the time to plant crops in the spring. Although there were so many yamen runners supervising them, and the yamen runners were holding such long whips, the bridge builders sighed and complained, saying, "This unkillable county magistrate is forcing us to build a bridge. We can't plant crops, so what will we eat in the autumn?"

    Drop by drop of sweat and tears, the bridge was built over many days and was finally completed. The county magistrate arrived on the bridge in a sedan carried by eight men. He dismissed the people following him and walked alone to the side of the Immortal Stone, saying triumphantly, "Immortal! Immortal, what kind of great fortune and honor should you give me this time? Look how well I've built the bridge!"

    The Immortal Stone moved, sat up, and turned into a real old man again. The old man said sternly, "I made two great wishes. If I personally see someone being hated by a thousand people, I will turn him into a black donkey. The second wish has also come true on you." As the old man spoke, he pointed his finger again, and a small road appeared in front of him. On the road, a black donkey, carrying a heavy load, walked step by step with its ears drooping. The old man waved his hand, and the road and the donkey disappeared.

    The county magistrate asked in surprise and doubt, "Is a white jade stone bridge not as good as a small bridge built with firewood?" The old man said angrily, "I don't know about that. You figure it out yourself. You should already be turning into a donkey now." As soon as the old man finished speaking, ears grew on top of the young man's head, and his mouth also lengthened. He wanted to shout, but instead made a donkey's bray. The people following him rushed to the bridge and looked into the gully. Beside the Immortal Stone, there was only a black donkey. They led it back, sold it to a salt peddler, and it often carried heavy loads of salt over this white jade stone bridge. However, no one ever knew what it was thinking.

    两大心愿
    董均伦　江源
    在一座古老的县城外面，有一条流水不大的深沟，在这深沟上面，修着一座很大的石桥。修这桥所用的石头，都是清一色的雪花白的石头。这种石头，是出在离县城几百里路外的大山上。石桥两边的石栏杆顶上，有的刻着很细致的小石狮子，有的刻着人物花草，可见当时是花费了不知多少功夫。
    这条深沟，在早年间，只是一条很窄的小沟，不但没有这座大石桥，就连一条独木桥也没有。那时沟虽不深，水也不大，一步却迈不过去。从这里过路的人，不管空手的，挑担的，都得脱了鞋才能过去，遇上冬天，冷水冰得骨头痛。离这路口不远的沟旁，有一块很奇怪的石头，当地的人都叫它“仙人石”。这仙人石，样子活像一个老汉躺在那里，要是你走近仔细地看，甚至能看得清眉眼和胡子。有人说，这仙人石曾经两次变成过仙人，那是因为在这小沟上，发生过两桩相同却又不同的事情。那时候，有一个孤苦贫穷的小伙子，他无地无土，天天上山打柴，天天从这小沟上过，天天看见人过这小沟时那么费事。这一天，他砍了一大担柴，挑到了小沟里时，看着这不宽的河水，心里想：每天这么多的人从这里路过，没有个搭脚的桥多不方便呀！我就出上这一担柴做个临时的桥吧，至少还方便几天啦。他心里虽是有点舍不得，不过，他还是把这担柴都填到沟里的水上了。人踏着柴禾过去，不用脱鞋也湿不了啦。谁走到这里，都夸奖一声：“什么人在这里搭桥啦，真好，多给人方便呀！”
    小伙子天天也从自己搭的桥上过，隔了几天，他已经不把这事放在心上了。这天晌午，他又打这里路过，看到那仙人石忽然动了，呀！坐起来了，那已不是石头，而是一个真真实实的老人了。老人走到了他的跟前，和蔼地说道：“小伙子，我已经在这里呆了千年了。我许下了两大心愿，如果我亲耳听到谁被别人称赞一百遍，我就要赐给他荣华富贵。这第一个心愿是应在你的身上了。”老人说着用手一指，面前出现了一条大路，大路上忽闪忽闪的来了一乘八人大轿，轿里坐着一个戴着纱帽的县官。老人说道：
  “你看清了吧，过不久你就是这个样子了。”老人把手一摆，大道和八人大轿都不见了。小伙子又羡慕又疑惑地问道：“我不识字，怎么能作县官呢？”老人拍拍他的肩膀说道：“小伙子，一点也不用犯难，尽管放心去进考场，我这里还有几两银子，你拿上做路费吧。”
    老人把银子交给了小伙子，在那沟边上又躺下了，他立刻又变成石头。
    小伙子有了银子，置办了衣裳行李，进了考场，拿起了笔来，笔好像自己会动一样，眼见着纸上就写满文章了。这一场，他果然中了秀才，他很是得意，收拾行李进了京。再一场中了举人，又一场中了进士，一道圣旨下来，派他去本县作县官。小伙子坐着八人大轿，耀武扬威地回家乡上任了。那真是说不尽的富贵荣华啊，鲜鱼好肉吃厌了，绸子缎子也穿腻了。他想：我一担柴禾搭了个桥，就得到了这样的荣华富贵，我要是修一座大桥，那更不知道能享什么福啦。
    于是他就吩咐人，把全县里能做得动活的人，都赶了来，有的被分派到几百里路外的山上去推那雪花一样的石头，有的就在那里挖宽这条小沟。这正是春天种地的时候，虽说是有那么多的衙役们监工，衙役们手里又拿着那么长的鞭子，修桥的人，都唉声叹气，就怨恨地说：“这个死不了的县官，抓咱来修桥，咱种不上庄稼，秋天吃什么呀！”
    一滴汗一滴泪地，大桥修了许多日子，终于修好了。那县官坐着八人大轿来到桥上了，他喝退了跟随的人，独自走到了仙人石旁边，扬扬得意地说道：“仙人啊！仙人，你这次应该给我什么样的大福大贵啊，你看我把桥修的有多好呀！”
    仙人石动了，坐起来了，又变成一个真正的老人了。老人威严地说道：“我许下了两大心愿，如果我亲眼看到，谁被一千个人怨恨，我就要使他变成一头黑色的毛驴。这第二个心愿也应在你的身上了。”老人说着，又用手一指，面前出现了一条小路，小路上一头黑驴，驮着沉重的驮子，压的搭拉着耳朵，一步一步往前走着。老汉把手一摆，小道和毛驴都不见了。
    县官惊疑地问道：“一座白玉石大桥，还不如用柴禾搭起的小桥吗？”老人气愤地说道：“这个我不知道，你自己想去吧，你现在已经该变成毛驴了。”老人的话刚完，小伙子头顶上长出耳朵了，嘴巴也变长了，他想喊，却是叫出驴的声音。跟随的人，赶到了桥上向沟里看时，那仙人石旁只有一头黑色的毛驴了。他们牵了回去，把它卖给了一个贩盐的脚夫，它驮着沉重的盐驮子，常常走过这白玉石桥，不过，没人再知道它想些什么了。
