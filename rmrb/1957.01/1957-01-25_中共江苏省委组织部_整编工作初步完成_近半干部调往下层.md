The Organization Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
Reorganization Work Initially Completed Nearly Half of Cadres Transferred to Lower Levels

    (Our report) Nanjing – The Organization Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the pilot unit for the reorganization of provincial-level organizations in Jiangsu, preliminarily completed its reorganization on January 11. The department originally had six sections, one office, and seventy-four cadres. After the reorganization, two sections were merged, and thirty-six cadres were transferred to lower levels, accounting for 48% of the original cadres. Among the transferred cadres, ten were at the section chief level and fifteen were at the division chief level.
    Before the reorganization, the department, like most leading organizations, had a large structure and excessive personnel, resulting in many bureaucratic phenomena.
    In early December of last year, all staff members of the department, based on studying the documents of the Eighth National Congress, conscientiously studied the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Second Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Provincial Party Committee, fully recognizing the great significance of streamlining the upper levels and strengthening the lower levels, rationally improving the system, and strengthening the ties between the Party and the people, and recognizing the responsibilities and attitudes that every Communist Party member should have on this issue.
    Based on this ideological understanding, the department mobilized all staff members to seriously and carefully discuss the department's future work tasks and the sections (offices) that must be set up according to the needs of the work tasks; during the discussion process, they also checked past work methods and styles. At the same time, the department's department affairs meeting repeatedly studied the preliminary plan for the department's future organizational structure and staffing, and submitted this plan to all staff members for discussion and revision, and finally the leadership decided and announced it.
    When discussing "who goes and who stays," the vast majority of comrades requested to be transferred to lower levels, hoping to go among the masses. When deciding on each comrade's "departure or stay," the leadership fully considered each person's strengths and interests and tried to accommodate them as much as possible, while also requiring each comrade to obey the needs of the work.
    Currently, the comrades who have been decided to go down are actively preparing. For example, comrades who have been decided to work in rural areas have been away from rural areas for many years, and they are currently burying themselves in studying relevant documents on rural work. Comrades who have been decided to stay are summarizing last year's work and formulating this year's work plans. The scope of work and responsibilities of each staff member have also been stipulated.

    中共江苏省委组织部
    整编工作初步完成  近半干部调往下层
    本报讯　江苏省级机关整编的先行单位——中共江苏省委组织部，已在1月11日初步整编结束。该部原有六个处一个室七十四个干部，经过整编，合并了两个处，下放了三十六个干部，占原有干部48％。在下放的干部中，有十个处长级干部，十五个科长级干部。
    在整编之前，该部和其他大多数领导机关一样，机构大、人员多，产生了不少官僚主义现象。
    去年12月初，该部全体工作人员在学习“八大”文件的基础上，认真学习了中共中央八届二中全会决议和省委第二次全体（扩大）会议的精神，充分认识到精简上层充实下层、合理改进体制、加强党与人民群众联系的重大意义，认识到每一个共产党员对这一问题应负的责任和应有的态度。
    在这一思想认识的基础上，该部发动全体工作人员认真地仔细地讨论了该部今后的工作任务，以及按照工作任务的需要而必须设置的处（室）；在讨论的过程中，并联系检查了过去的工作方法与工作作风。与此同时，该部部务会议反复地研究了该部今后机构设置与人员配备的初步方案，并将这个方案交全体工作人员讨论修正，最后由领导上决定、公布。
    在讨论“谁去谁留”时，绝大多数同志要求下放，希望到群众中去。在决定每个同志“去、留”时，领导上充分考虑到了每人的特长与爱好，并尽量予以照顾，同时也要求每个同志必须服从工作的需要。
    目前，该部决定下去的同志都正在积极准备。例如决定去农村工作的同志，他们离开农村已多年了，这几天正在埋头学习农村工作的有关文件。决定留下的同志正在总结去年的工作和制订今年的工作计划。对每个工作人员的工作范围和责任也作了规定。（冯俊、吴石夫）
