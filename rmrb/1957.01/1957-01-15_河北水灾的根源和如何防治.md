According to historical records, floods in Hebei Province, China, occurred on average once every 31.5 years in the Tang Dynasty, once every 30.2 years in the Song Dynasty, once every 4.8 years in the Yuan Dynasty, once every 11.3 years in the Ming Dynasty, and once every 5.3 years in the Qing Dynasty [Note 1]. From these figures, the frequency of floods in Hebei Province increased steadily over time. The areas affected by floods also expanded continuously. In the Tang Dynasty, the floods only affected the prefectures of Wei, Bei (now Qinghe County), Ding, Yi, Ji, Ying (now Hejian County), Jing, Cang, Zhen (now Zhengding County), and You. There are no records of floods in the prefectures of Ming (now Yongnian County), Xing, Zhao, Shen, Bao, and Zhuo, as well as the northern and northeastern regions of Hebei. During the Northern Song Dynasty, Hebei's area was only half of what it is today, and the areas affected by floods were only Zhen Ding (now Zhengding), Daming, Ci Ming, Shen, Ji, Jin, Ying, Cang, Xiong, Mo, and Ba prefectures, while there are no records of floods in Xing, Zhao, Ding, and Bao prefectures. By the Yuan Dynasty, the areas affected by floods expanded sharply. Prefectures that had no floods in the Tang and Song Dynasties, such as Xing, Zhao, Bao, and Zhuo, began to experience floods. Some areas that had few floods in the past began to have more. By the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the flood-affected areas expanded even further. Even higher areas at the foot of the Taihang Mountains, such as Lincheng, Gaoyi, Yuanshi, Mancheng, and Fangshan counties, occasionally experienced floods.

From the third year of Zhenguan in the Tang Dynasty (629 AD) to the thirty-third year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (1907 AD), over a period of 1,278 years, the number of floods in Hebei increased sixfold; the disaster area gradually spread to the entire plain. What is the reason for this? The occurrence of floods has both natural and man-made causes, such as heavy rainstorms and the disrepair of water conservancy projects. However, the gradual destruction of mountain forests and the gradual siltation of rivers and lakes in Hebei Province over the 670 years since the Yuan Dynasty are the fundamental causes of floods.

Now, let's first look at the situation on the ground in Hebei during the Tang and Song Dynasties. At that time, although the famous Dalu Ze (Great Swamp) had been silted up into three fragments (Nanbo between Julu and Longping, Beibo in Ningjin County, and Dalu Ze between Shenzhou and Shulu), it was still a large swamp capable of holding a lot of river water. In addition to this, there was Kangtai Ze in the south (the old site in Guangping County), Ji Ze (the old site in Yongnian County), Dong Pitang (the old site in Quzhou County), Cormorant Pond (the old site between Wei County and Linzhang County, with a circumference of eighty li); in the central part there were Panpu Ze (the old site in Shenze County), Pu Ze (the old site in Zhengding County), Lei Ze (the old site in Jin County), Tang Pond (the old site in Tang County), Tianjing Ze, Heishui Pond (the old sites are all in Ding County), Junzi Dian (the old site in Boye County), Ling Zhao, Zi Bo (the old sites are all in Wuji County), Yangcheng Dian (the old site in Wangdu County), Yang Yu Ze (the old site in Ji County), Wuqiang Lake (the old site in Wuyi County), Da Pu Dian (the old site in Hejian County), Wuqing Pond, Samosa Pond (the old sites are all in Cang County), and Fangyuan (the old site in Xian County, which was a large lake with a circumference of three hundred li). In addition, during the Northern Song Dynasty, in order to defend against the invasion of the Khitans, a defense line was built from the north mountain of Mancheng County, passing through the northern border of Qingyuan County, and then southeast to Bianwu Dian in Gaoyang, around An, Xin, Xiong, Ba and other prefectures and counties, turning southeast, passing through Qing County to Nigukou, using several rivers and Dianbo to connect them. There were thirty Dianbo on this defense line. Of particular note are Xitang Bo and Shenyuan Bo within Mancheng County. Both of these Bo were artificially excavated. The Song History, River Canal Records, states: "Starting from the northwest of Baozhou, Shenyuan River was stored as a pond, measuring thirty li wide and ten li long, with a depth of five chi or three chi, called Shenyuan Bo. West of Baozhou, Jiju Spring and Shang Spring (now Yimuchuan) were combined into rice paddies and square fields, measuring ten li wide and deep from five chi to three chi, called Xitang Bo." This record proves that the local spring water was extremely abundant. However, these two Bo have long been silted up and become the so-called "land of regret" [Note 2]. There were also many Dianbo in the north. The most famous in history were Dukang Bo and Ming Ze in Zhuozhou, Yongnu Sou in the southwest of Wuqing, which spanned several counties, and West Lake in Youzhou. In addition, Yizhou had Jintai Bo, Rongcheng had Da Ni Dian and Xiao Ni Dian, Gaoyang had Bian Wu and Yi Zi Dian, Xiong Prefecture had Xiangzi Dian (with a circumference of two hundred and twenty li) and Taihu Dian, Wenan had Zhao Dian and Fox Dian, Renqiu had Jue Li Dian, and Tongzhou had Yanfang Dian and Jinzhan Dian [Note 3]. In this way, even in the event of a rainstorm, because there were so many water-retaining swamps and Dian, the floods would not be too great or too frequent.

Secondly, let's examine the situation of the mountainous areas of Hebei in history. Song Hui Yao Gao, Volume 177, records that during the reign of Emperor Huizong, "the forests along the western mountains of Hebei were dense, and many fugitives were hiding among them." The Taiping Huanyu Ji says: "There is Songshan Mountain northwest of Mancheng, named for the pine forests that cover it." "Baishan Mountain is connected to Hengshan Mountain, named for the many cypresses." The Emperor's Capital Scenic Objects Record describes the construction of Yung Temple on Shijing Mountain in Fangshan County: "The Great Nirvana Sutra of the Zhenguan period was completed, and in June of that year, a thousand large trees floated down the river to the foot of the mountain, constructing the Yung Temple." In the sixth year of Xuanhe (1124 AD), Xu Kangzong's Record of Entering Jin describes the scenery he saw when he passed through Shanhaiguan: "Looking back from the mountain, the fertile fields stretched for thousands of miles. The northern limit is the high mountain... The south of the mountain has everything from five grains and hundred fruits to beautiful wood and good timber." The Taihang Mountain section of Gujin Tushu Jicheng Shanchuan Dian says: "Zhu Zi said that Hebei looked like black clouds in the sky." Although these are just glimpses, they are enough to reflect the face of the forests in the Taihang Mountains in that era. These records not only show that there were forests in the Taihang Mountains at that time, but also that they were very dense. The mountains were covered with forests, which naturally maintained soil and water, conserved water sources, and reduced the erosion of floods, so the siltation of rivers and Dian was much slower than later.

Although there are no explicit historical records of the destruction of forests in the mountainous areas of Hebei, legend has it that they were completely burned down after the Yuan army invaded Hebei. This is highly probable, evidenced by the historical facts that the Yuan army burned, killed, and destroyed everywhere, and that righteous people from Hebei gathered in the mountains and forests to resist the Yuan army. The legend should not be wrong. However, the invasions of Liao and Jin cannot be said to have had no connection. In order to maintain their ruling position, these invaders brutally massacred the people and destroyed their undertakings. The Liao, Jin, and Yuan dynasties ruled Hebei for as long as 246 years, and the Ming and Qing dynasties did not have forest protection policies, so wouldn't the destruction of forests be very natural? Of course, it is also a fact that in those years, the people were cruelly exploited and forced to live in poverty, so they entered the mountains to cut down trees and open up cultivated land. This also explains why since the Yuan Dynasty, dozens of large swamps and lakes in Hebei have quickly been silted up into flat land. Only Baiyangdian remains of these Ze and Dian, and it is becoming shallower year by year. How to protect this only remaining large Dian is a problem that needs to be addressed quickly.

The Dalu Ze was silted up by the Yellow River. The Ming River, Li River, Qili River, Dahuo River, Bei Ma River, and Xiao Ma River, which originally flowed into the Dalu Ze, still flow into the already silted Ze site, and then into the Fuyang River. Therefore, when the rainy season comes, the Fuyang River cannot hold so much water, and it floods. The Zhi River, Ji River, Huai River, and Xiao River, which originally flowed into Ningjin Bo, still flow into the already silted Bo site and into the Fuyang River, also causing floods in the Fuyang River during the rainy season. A Fuyang River replaced the Dalu Ze. Like the Hutuo River, it carries excessive floodwaters downstream during the rainy season, converging in Xian County, changing its name to Ziya River, and flowing northeast into the already silted-up Dong Dian. The Ci River, Sha River, and Lao Tang River converge into the Zhulong River, which flows into Baiyangdian, and often overflows during the rainy season. The old sites of other Dianbo are also like this. Some of them have been silted up slightly higher, causing the rivers to change their courses, such as the Hutuo River, which changed its course to the south and east after the Bianwu Dian was silted up. Then, can we restore several Ze Dian where many waters converge, or appropriately dig several artificial lakes to accommodate the outbreak of mountain torrents? This is a question that urgently needs to be studied.

Originally, each of the major rivers in Hebei had its own port to the sea. When the Northern Song Dynasty built the defense line, it diverted the Hutuo, Zhang, Wei and other rivers to the Dianbo area to increase the water勢; the Yuan Dynasty also diverted the Zhang, Wei and other waters to aid the Yun River. In addition, the Bei Yun River, Yongding River, and Daqing River all converged into the Hai River in Tianjin and entered the sea. Whenever there is heavy rain in summer, mountain torrents will break out. How can we avoid floods! After liberation, a new outlet to the sea has been opened for the Daqing River, and it is time for the other rivers to restore their old courses to the sea. This is also a problem that urgently needs to be solved.

“Ten years to grow trees” refers to growing trees on fertile plains. Afforestation in mountainous areas should be discussed separately. It is not easy to become a forest in twenty years. At present, the work of closing mountains for afforestation and soil and water conservation is being actively carried out in Shanxi, Shaanxi and other provinces, but Hebei is not doing enough. In Hebei, some water conservancy management agencies have only carried out some emergency repairs of small reservoirs, but have not carried out afforestation and soil and water conservation work. There are also some places that only manage afforestation, but it has nothing to do with soil and water conservation. When carrying out these tasks, they are all doing their own thing and not cooperating with each other, resulting in wasted effort. In order to eliminate floods, we should intensify the construction of water source forests and also intensify soil and water conservation work, forming these tasks into a great mass movement with planned technical guidance. I think this is also a problem that urgently needs to be considered.

In short, floods in Hebei are caused by the impact of natural environment destruction and summer floods. Especially when typhoons hit and cause unusual rainstorms, the disaster is even more serious. To fundamentally eliminate floods, it seems that the above three issues should be considered.

[Note 1] The calculated averages are based on Chen Gaoyong's: Table of Natural and Man-made Disasters in China Throughout History.
The records from the third year of Zhenguan in the Tang Dynasty to the thirty-third year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty were selected, and the years in which more than ten prefectures and counties were flooded and only "Hebei Flood" and "Zhili Flood" were recorded were used as the basis for calculating floods. Years before Zhenguan and at the end of the Tang Dynasty, Five Dynasties, Southern Song Dynasty, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties are missing records, so they are not included in the calculation.

[Note 2] According to local water conservancy officials, these two low-lying areas are 6,000 mu and 10,000 mu respectively. Because the crops planted on this land are flooded and people regret it, and they regret it when the water does not flood without planting, the farmers call it the land of regret.

[Note 3] The lakes and swamps listed are scattered in Yuanhe Shire Tuji, Taiping Huanyu Ji, Song Shi Hequ Zhi, Liao Shi Dilizhi, Jin Shi Dilizhi, and Benji.

    河北水灾的根源和如何防治
    北京农业大学教授　薛培元
    根据历史文献的记载，我国河北省的水灾，在唐代平均三十一点五年发生一次，宋代平均每三十点二年发生一次，元代平均每四点八年发生一次，明代平均每十一点三年发生一次，清代平均每五点三年发生一次〔注一〕。从这个数字来看，河北省水灾发生的次数是随着时间的推移在不断地增加着。水灾所波及的地区也在不断地扩大。在唐代水灾所波及的地区不过魏、贝（今清河县）、定、易、冀、瀛（今河间县）、景、沧、镇（今正定县）、幽等州，而洺（今永年县）、邢、赵、深、保、涿等州以及河北北部和东北部地区都没有发生水灾的记录。北宋时期，河北的面积只有现在的一半，而遭受水灾的地区只有真定（今正定）、大名、磁洺、深、冀、晋、瀛、沧、雄、莫、霸等州，而邢、赵、定、保等州则没有水灾的记录。到了元代遭受水灾的地区骤然扩大，原先在唐、宋两代没有水灾的地区，如邢、赵、保、涿四州，也开始有水灾了。有些原先水灾很少的地区，则开始多起来了。到明、清两代，水灾地区更加扩大，甚至太行山麓较高的地区如临城、高邑、元氏、满城、房山等县，也时而有水灾发生。
    从唐贞观三年（公元629年）到清光绪三十三年（公元1907年）的一千二百七十八年间，河北水灾的次数增加到六倍；受灾面积逐渐波及到整个平原地带。这是甚么原因呢？水灾的发生固然有自然的和人为的两种原因，如大风雨和水利工程年久失修等；但是自元以后六百七十多年当中，河北省的山林逐年破坏，川泽逐年淤塞，才是酿成水灾的根本原因。
    现在先让我们看一看唐、宋时代河北地面上的情形吧。在那时，著名的大陆泽虽然已被淤垫成了三个片段，（巨鹿、隆平间的南泊，宁晋境内的北泊和深州、束鹿间的大陆泽）仍然是容纳许多河水的大泽。除此以外，南部有康台泽（故址在广平县）、鸡泽（故址在永年县）、董陂塘（故址在曲周县）、鸬鹚陂（故址在魏县和临漳县之间，周围有八十里）；中部有盘蒲泽（故址在深泽县）、蒲泽（故址在正定县）、雷泽（故址在晋县）、唐池（故址在唐县）、天井泽、黑水池（故址都在定县）、君子淀（故址在博野县）、灵沼、滋泊（故址都在无极县）、阳城淀（故址在望都县）、杨纡泽（故址在冀县）、武强湖（故址在武邑县）、大浦淀（故址在河间县）、仵清池、萨摩陂（故址都在沧县）、房渊（故址在献县，是一个大湖，周围有三百里）。此外，北宋时代为了防御契丹的入侵，自满城县北山起经清苑县北境再向东南到高阳边吴淀，绕安、新、雄、霸等州县，折向东南，经青县境到泥沽海口，利用几条河流和淀泊，连结起来，修成了一道国防线。在这道国防线上的淀泊就有三十个。其中可注意的是满城县境内的西塘泊和沈苑泊。这两个泊都是人工开凿的。宋史河渠志记载：起“保州西北，蓄沈苑河为塘，衡广三十里，纵十里，其深五尺或三尺，曰沈苑泊。自保州西合鸡距泉、尚泉（即今一亩泉）为稻田、方田，衡广十里，其深五尺至三尺，曰西塘泊”。这段记载可以证明当地泉水极其丰富。可是现在这两个泊早已淤塞了，成了所谓“后悔地”〔注二〕。至于北部的淀泊也不少。在历史上最著名的是涿州的督亢陂和鸣泽，武清西南跨几县地方的雍奴薮和幽州的西湖。此外，易州有金台陂，容城有大泥淀、小泥淀，高阳有边吴、宜子两淀，雄州有襄子淀（周围有二百二十里）和台胡淀，文安有赵淀和狐狸淀，任丘有掘鲤淀，通州有延芳淀和金盏淀〔注三〕。这样，纵然遇到暴风骤雨，因为有这末多蓄水的泽、淀，水灾也不致于太大太多。
    其次，我们考察一下历史上河北山区的情形。宋会要稿卷一七七载徽宗时“河朔沿西山一带林木茂密，多有逋逃藏匿其间”。太平寰宇记上说：“满城西北有松山，因松林遍布得名。”“柏山与恒山相连，多柏故名。”帝京景物略记载房山县石经山云居寺兴筑的经过说：“贞观大涅盘经成，其年六月水浮大木千株至山下，构云居寺焉。”宣和六年（公元1124）许亢宗入金记叙述他路经山海关所看到的情形说：“登山回望，沃野千里。北限大山，……山之南则五谷百果，美木良材无所不有。”古今图书集成山川典太行山部上说：“朱子称河北望之如黑云在半天”。这些虽是一鳞半爪的纪录，但也足够反映那个时代太行山区森林的面貌。这些记载不仅说明了那时太行山还有森林，而且还很茂密。山区被森林遮盖着，自然可以保持水土，涵蓄水源，减轻洪水的冲刷，因而河淀的淤塞也就较后来缓和得多。
    河北山区森林的被毁灭，历史上虽然没有明文记载，但传说是元兵侵入河北后彻底烧毁的。这个可能性很大，证以元兵到处烧杀破坏和河北义民聚集山林抵抗元兵的史实，传说当不致于错误。可是辽金的入侵也不能说没有关系。这些入侵者为了维持他们的统治地位，都是极惨酷地虐杀人民和毁灭人民的事业的。辽、金、元统治河北达二百四十六年之久，明、清两代对于森林也没有保护政策，所以毁灭森林岂不是很自然的吗？当然，在那些年代里人民受他们惨酷的剥削，被逼得无法生活，因而入山砍伐林木，开辟耕地，也是事实。这也说明了为什么自元代以来河北几十处大泽淀大湖泊很快就被淤垫成了平地。这些泽、淀到现在只剩下白洋淀一处了，而且还逐年淤浅。如何保得住这一个仅存的大淀，是眼前要赶快设法处理的问题。
    大陆泽被黄河淤平了，原来注入大陆泽的洺河、澧水、七里河、达活水、北马河、小马河等仍旧流到已经淤平的泽址，然后再注入釜阳河。因而一到雨季，釜阳河容不下这末多的水，就泛滥成灾。原来流入宁晋泊的泜水、泲水、槐水、洨水现在照旧流到已经淤塞了的泊址，注入釜阳河，也造成釜阳河雨季的泛滥。一条釜阳河代替了大陆泽。它同滹沱河一样，在雨季都是载着过量的洪水下行，到献县汇流，改称子牙河，向东北注入已塞平的东淀。磁河、沙河、老唐河合流为潴龙河，注入白洋淀，每到雨季也常常外溢。其他淀泊的故址也是如此。其中也有淤得稍高，使河流改道的，像滹沱河淤塞了边吴淀以后，又改道偏南向东流。那末我们可不可以恢复几处众水所汇的泽淀，或者适当地另凿几处人工湖，以容纳暴发的山洪呢？这是迫切需要研究的问题。
    原来河北的几条大河都各有入海的港口。北宋修筑国防线时，把滹沱、漳、卫等河都引向淀泊区域，以增水势；元代修运河也引漳、卫等水济运。再加上北运河、永定河、大清河全都集中到天津境内汇为海河入海。每逢夏季大雨山洪就会暴发，怎能免除水灾！解放后，已给大清河另辟了海口，其他各河恢复旧道入海也是时候了。这也是一个急待解决的问题。
      “十年树木”，这是指在肥沃的平原上说的，至于山区造林又当别论。二十年成林还怕不容易。现在封山育林和水土保持的工作正在山西、陕西等省积极进行，而在河北作得还很不够。在河北，目前有些管理水利的机构，只进行了一些抢修小型水库的工作，而没有进行造林和保持水土的工作。也有一些地方只管造林，却与水土保持无关。在进行这些工作的时候，都是各自为政，互不配合，结果是劳而无功。为了消灭水灾，我们应该加紧先造水源林，同时也加紧进行水土保持工作，把这些工作形成一个有计划有技术指导的伟大的群众性运动，是很必要的。我看这也是一个急需考虑的问题。
    总之，河北的水灾是受自然环境破坏的影响和夏季洪水的影响而发生的。尤其是当台风波及时所形成的不平常的暴雨，灾情就更严重。如何从根本上消灭水灾，似乎应当考虑以上三个问题。
    〔注一〕所计算的平均数字是根据陈高佣：中国历代天灾人祸表，
            择引了其中自唐贞观三年到清光绪三十三年的纪录，选
            取了其中十个州县以上被水灾的和只记“河北大水”和
            “直隶大水”的年份作为水灾计算出来的。贞观以前和
            唐末、五代、南宋、元、明、清各代的末年缺少纪录，
            所以都没计算在内。
    〔注二〕据当地水利负责干部对我说：这两块洼地一是六千亩，
            一是一万亩，因这块地种上庄稼水淹了后悔，不种水又
            没淹也后悔，所以农民们称为后悔地。
    〔注三〕所举泽淀湖泊散见于元和郡县图志、太平寰宇记、宋史
            河渠志、辽史地理志、金史地理志和本纪。
