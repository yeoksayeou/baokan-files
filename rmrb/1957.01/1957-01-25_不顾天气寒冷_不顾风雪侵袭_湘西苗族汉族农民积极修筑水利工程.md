Xinhua News Agency, Jishou, 21st January: In the mountain valleys and flatlands of the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, thousands upon thousands of Miao and Han farmers have been braving wind and snow in recent days to build small-scale farmland water conservancy projects. Upon completion of these projects, the prefecture will increase the irrigated area for rice paddies by 200,000 mu and improve the irrigation of 270,000 mu of existing rice paddies. Together with the water conservancy projects built in the past few years, the total irrigated area for rice paddies in the autonomous prefecture will be more than 1.4 million mu, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total rice paddy area in the prefecture.

Before liberation, two-thirds of the rice paddies in the autonomous prefecture relied on rainwater for irrigation. If it didn't rain for a month, these rice paddies would have to be converted to grow coarse grains. Since liberation, the Party and the government have led the people of all ethnic groups to build tens of thousands of small-scale farmland water conservancy projects. The Longtan River, known as the "fierce mountain dragon" by the Miao people because of its floods and droughts, has also been tamed. Although the several thousand mu of rice paddies on both sides of this river suffered a severe drought last year, the average yield was still 496 jin of rice per mu, an increase of 10% compared to 1955.

Now, only 600,000 to 700,000 mu of rice paddies in the autonomous prefecture lack irrigation. The Xiangxi Autonomous Prefecture Water Conservancy Bureau has already formulated a plan to continue developing water conservancy construction. In another five years, the Xiangxi mountain area, which is known for its drought, will basically eliminate drought conditions.

### 不顾天气寒冷　不顾风雪侵袭  湘西苗族汉族农民积极修筑水利工程

    不顾天气寒冷　不顾风雪侵袭
    湘西苗族汉族农民积极修筑水利工程
    新华社吉首21日电　在湘西苗族自治州的山沟里和坪坝上，成千上万的苗族汉族农民连日冒着风雪修筑小型农田水利工程。这批工程完工后，全州将增加稻田灌溉面积二十万亩，改善稻田灌溉面积二十七万亩。加上过去几年兴修的水利工程，自治州的稻田灌溉面积共有一百四十多万亩，占全州稻田总面积的三分之二多。
    解放前，自治州境内有三分之二的稻田是靠雨水灌溉的，只要一个月不下雨，这些稻田就得改种杂粮。解放以来，党和政府领导各族农民兴修了几万处小型农田水利工程。雨涝晴旱被苗家称为“深山凶龙”的龙潭河也被治服了。这条河两岸的几千亩稻田，去年虽然遭受大旱，平均每亩仍收稻谷四百九十六斤，比1955年增产一成。
    现在自治州缺少灌溉条件的稻田只有六七十万亩了。自治州水利局已经制定继续发展水利建设的规划。再过五年，以干旱著名的湘西山区将基本消除旱象。
