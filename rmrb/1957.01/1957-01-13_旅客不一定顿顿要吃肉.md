    Travelers Don't Necessarily Need Meat with Every Meal
    Restaurants in Hankou stipulate that meals must be stir-fried dishes, otherwise, they will not sell rice. Originally, travelers don't necessarily want to eat meat every meal, but all stir-fried dishes have meat, which forces those who don't want to eat meat to eat meat every meal. Isn't this an artificial waste? At the same time, this also increases the burden on travelers.
    It is suggested that restaurants in various places, in the spirit of both meeting customer needs and saving, prepare some delicious vegetarian dishes, saving some pork for the country to supply more people.　Rong Jianhua

    旅客不一定顿顿要吃肉
    汉口市的饭店规定，到饭店用饭必须炒菜，否则就不卖饭。本来旅客不一定每餐都要吃肉，但是炒菜里都有肉，使得不想吃肉的也一定要每餐吃肉，这不是人为的浪费吗？同时这也增加了旅客的负担。
    建议各地饭馆本着既能满足顾客需要，又能节约的精神，预备一些可口的素菜，为国家节省出一些猪肉来供应更多的群众。　荣建华
