Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 7th: Budapest newspapers on the 6th published a statement by the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government on the most important tasks at present.

	The Counter-Revolution Has Suffered a Decisive Defeat; The Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government is a Government of the Proletarian Dictatorship
	The introduction to the statement, in reviewing the development of events since the establishment of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government on November 4, pointed out that international imperialism, which rudely interfered in Hungary's internal affairs, and the Hungarian counter-revolution it supported, have suffered a decisive defeat. Our government is a socialist Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, a government of the proletarian dictatorship. After their defeat in armed struggle, the counter-revolutionaries began to put on a hypocritical face of compassion, demanding "democracy and freedom" from our government. On this issue, we also declare clearly and unequivocally: a proletarian dictatorship exists in Hungary. Our government and our people can only achieve success through consistently and openly struggling against counter-revolutionary and imperialist forces. In the Workers' and Peasants' state of Hungary under the proletarian dictatorship, democracy and freedom are granted to workers, working peasants, intellectuals loyal to the people, and all Hungarian citizens who abide by the law. Counter-revolutionaries and imperialist spies, those who attack the legitimate system of the Hungarian People's Republic and the main institutions of the Republic, and those who incite opposition to them, even if they use the slogan of democracy to disguise their counter-revolutionary activities, have not been given freedom and cannot be given freedom. The law will always punish them most severely.

	In its activities, the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government must first rely on the working class and the working masses. We are willing to solve some of the basic problems facing our motherland by deepening and expanding the democracy of the Hungarian People's Republic. In leading the work of the state, we will never allow the anti-Leninist methods, the cult of personality, and the lack of concern for the interests of the masses of the Rakosi-Gero group to be revived. The sole purpose of all our government's measures is to defend and serve the interests of the working people and socialism.

	We clearly understand that there are still many complex tasks unresolved before us, especially in the economic field. However, before continuing to move forward, the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government remains true to our principle: building socialism in our People's Republic is the vital cause of the masses.

	Consolidating State Power and Further Democratization
	The first part of the statement deals with consolidating state power and further democratizing state power. This part says: Imperialists and counter-revolutionaries, using the method of armed rebellion and, after the failure of the rebellion, using political offensives and provocative activities with inflammatory slogans, have concentrated all their strength to eliminate, or at least to disintegrate and weaken, the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' state, its central and local institutions. At the same time, those who hold petty-bourgeois anarchist views and shamelessly call themselves Marxists have put forward slogans such as "democratization" and "struggle against Stalinism," but their actual purpose is to disintegrate and destroy our state system and social system.

	In the struggle against this tendency, we must use all our strength to protect and consolidate the system and institutions of our socialist-type people's democratic Workers' and Peasants' state. This is always the most important task, because only such a state can embody the power of the working class allied with the peasants and the proletarian dictatorship, and can guarantee the construction of our country and the complete victory of socialism.

	We must protect and consolidate the inviolability of factories, mines, cooperatives, state farms, machine tractor stations, peasant land, and the property of handicraftsmen, all owned by the people. One of the most important guarantees of the democratization of our country is that the popularly elected organs of state power, the National Assembly and local councils, should hold regular meetings and make decisions in accordance with the powers granted by the Constitution.

	The statement said that a democratization movement should be carried out in administrative organs, with a large reduction in personnel to simplify state organs, decentralization of central organs, strengthening of administrative functions, strengthening of administrative work in the political aspect, and consolidation of the socialist legal system. The government believes that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party is the party of the working class, the organized force and leading force of the Communists; the Patriotic People's Front led by the revolutionary party of the working class is the organization that unites all democratic forces.

	Current Temporary Economic Measures
	The second part of the statement talks about the current temporary economic measures. The statement pointed out that due to the events, the value of destroyed commodity storage was 1.5 billion forints, the losses of public and private buildings reached 1 billion forints, and the losses due to strikes were approximately 9 billion forints. The statement then affirmed that our country will overcome these economic difficulties. "Of course, we are willing to accept loans, even loans provided by capitalist countries, as long as such loans do not have any political conditions attached." How much time is needed to overcome these temporary difficulties depends primarily on ourselves. The statement then listed the economic tasks, the main one of which is to increase coal production. Before coal production is greatly increased, we will have to restrict the production of certain enterprises and stop the production of other enterprises due to lack of power. The government will do everything possible to eliminate the threat of inflation. It intends to establish a strict system of thrift in public finances and improve production technology. The government will strive to create labor conditions. On the other hand, it is already working to take various measures to provide various facilities to alleviate unemployment.

	Tasks in the Industrial Field
	The third part of the statement analyzes the tasks in the industrial field. The government believes that it is necessary to first replace the second five-year plan, which was prepared in the past, with a plan for 1957, in order to overcome these temporary difficulties. The main task of this plan should be to improve the living standards of the workers. Whether in industry or in other fields, we will first produce commodities, and the conditions for producing commodities in our country are more favorable than in other countries. Finally, the government believes that it is beneficial to expand the activities of private handicrafts and handicraft cooperatives.

	Tasks in the Agricultural Field
	The fourth part discusses the tasks in the agricultural field. This part first points out that the worker-peasant alliance has once again stood the test of history. Just as rural laborers obtained land in the struggle led by the working class and the Communist Party in 1945, today the working class and the Communists first opposed the counter-revolution, thus helping the peasants defend their land. The government intends to widely use agronomy and mechanization to strengthen the intensive cultivation of land. The government believes that the socialist transformation of agriculture is a top priority task. It will give full support to working peasants so that they can establish prosperous cooperatives on a completely voluntary basis according to their own decisions. In the future, the government will still play an important role in state farms and maintain a network of machine tractor stations, so that these machine tractor stations can also help individual peasants cultivate their land.

	The government reiterates its determination to punish all acts that violate the property of working peasants, the property of agricultural production cooperatives, the property of state farms, and the property of machine tractor stations. The government advocates simplifying the leadership of agriculture, announces that it is prepared to allow the sale of land under certain restrictions, but private land shall not exceed ten to fifteen hectares. The government also allows producers to rent land and freely sell agricultural products. The government will establish a national land fund to compensate for violations committed against middle peasants and small peasants. Finally, the government is willing to make it possible for all producers to improve their business knowledge.

	Tasks in the Commercial Field
	The fifth part talks about the tasks in the commercial field. The statement clearly pointed out: The importance of socialist commerce will not be reduced in the future. The government believes that it is necessary to allow a certain development of private commerce. The statement pointed out: Economic relations between Hungary and foreign countries should be established on the basis of complete equality of rights and mutual benefit. The statement said: The government believes that the monopoly of foreign trade is one of the foundations of the socialist economy.

	Economic Leadership Methods
	The sixth part talks about economic leadership methods. This part determines that democratic centralism in accordance with Leninist ideas is the best method of economic leadership in socialist construction. However, central leadership should be limited to the most fundamental issues, and enterprises should enjoy greater independence than before. The leaders of enterprises should implement the legal resolutions of the factory workers' committees, but they should also refuse and prevent the implementation of illegal decisions that the workers' committees may make. The statement once again pointed out: The workers' committee is the power organ through which producers participate in leading the enterprise economy through their elected representatives.

	Attitude on Cultural Issues
	The seventh part shows the attitude on cultural issues. This part points out: The government guarantees freedom of scientific work and freedom of artistic creation, and guarantees respect for scientific beliefs and artistic beliefs. The government advocates strengthening international cultural exchanges. The government hopes that outstanding scientists and experts will decide for themselves the methods used in research, and hopes that academicians will play a greater role in solving various tasks in the national economy. The statement advocates implementing a socialist patriotic and democratic school education, making it free from the interference of any temporary policies. Foreign language education will be chosen voluntarily by students. It should be guaranteed that the best students receive secondary and higher education. The number of classrooms must be increased, and efforts must be made to restore the system of people's schools. The statement pointed out that university reforms will be carried out and scientific and artistic committees will be established outside the cultural leadership organs. There is an urgent need to stipulate practical organizational forms sufficient to broadly develop literature and art. The task of the Ministry of Culture is to lead cultural activities in principle.

	Relations between the State and the Church
	The eighth part talks about the relations between the state and the church. This part first affirms: The Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution, respects the freedom of belief of every citizen. The government believes that religious belief is a private matter for citizens. The government allows the establishment of religious elective courses. What the government expects is that church leaders and non-church leaders perform their duties in accordance with the spirit of complete compliance with the law. If there is discrimination within the church against those who promote progressive political beliefs, the government believes that this is intolerable. Possible differences should be resolved through consultation and agreements between the state and the church.

	Foreign Policy Issues
	The ninth part talks about foreign policy issues. The basis of the government's foreign policy is the international solidarity of the workers, and the eternal alliance with the Soviet Union and all countries in the socialist camp. The fundamental principle of our country's foreign policy is to establish peaceful relations that produce good results with all countries, regardless of the differences in social systems, based on the principles of equality of rights, national independence and sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, and mutual benefit. The statement pointed out: Those who are hostile to our people and the Hungarian People's Republic are trying their best to give a malicious account of our country's relations with the Soviet Union. The statement expressed admiration for the role played by the Soviet Union in liberating Hungary in World War II, and for the role played by the Soviet Union in dealing with counter-revolutionary forces. In the current situation, the Soviet troops stationed in Hungary are protecting the Hungarian people from possible armed attacks by foreign imperialist forces, thereby ensuring that our people can live in peace and that our people can contribute their strength to the great cause of seeking greater happiness for our country. In Stalin's later years, some problems arose in the relations between Hungary and the Soviet Union. Because these problems were not resolved, the healthy development of relations between the two brotherly countries was hindered. But recently this unhealthy state has largely been eliminated, and it has been eliminated in an atmosphere of complete mutual understanding. The governments of Hungary and the Soviet Union are both prepared to resolve all current and future issues concerning Hungarian-Soviet relations (including the issue of Soviet troops stationed in Hungary) through friendly negotiations, so that the resolution of the issues is in line with the fraternal friendship and alliance between the two countries. The fundamental principle for resolving the issues is to respect proletarian internationalism, equality, national sovereignty and national independence, non-interference in internal affairs and mutual benefit, as stated in the declaration on the relations between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries published on October 30 last year.

	Uniting Domestic Progressive Forces
	The last part of the statement talks about uniting domestic progressive forces. The government announced that it is prepared to begin negotiations with people from various parties or non-party people and experts in accordance with the political line indicated in this document, in order to ensure that all those who are willing to work hard to oppose counter-revolutionary forces, work hard to maintain the people's cause, defend socialist achievements, and fight for the continued construction of socialism, for the prosperity of the country and the happiness of the people, participate in the formulation of detailed plans. The government is also prepared to have them participate in the government.

    匈牙利当前最重要的任务
    工农革命政府发表声明
    新华社布达佩斯7日电　布达佩斯报纸6日登载了匈牙利工农革命政府就当前最重要的任务发表的声明。
    反革命已遭到肯定的失败，工农革命政府是无产阶级专政的政府
    这篇声明的绪言在回顾11月4日工农革命政府成立以后的事态发展时指出，粗暴干涉匈牙利内政的国际帝国主义和它所支持的匈牙利反革命，已经遭到肯定的失败。我们的政府是社会主义工农革命政府，无产阶级专政的政府。反革命分子在武装斗争中失败之后，开始摆出一付悲天悯人的面孔，向我们的政府要求“民主和自由”。我们在这个问题上也明确干脆地声明：在匈牙利存在着无产阶级专政。我国政府、我国人民只有一贯地对反革命和帝国主义势力进行公开的斗争才能获得成就。在无产阶级专政的匈牙利工农国家里，民主和自由是给予工人、劳动农民、忠于人民的知识分子和遵守法律的全体匈牙利公民的。反革命分子和帝国主义间谍，进攻匈牙利人民共和国合法制度和共和国主要机构、煽动反对它们的那些分子，即使他们用民主的口号来掩饰自己的反革命活动，没有而且也不可能给他们自由。法律将永远最严厉地制裁他们。
    工农革命政府在自己的活动中首先要依靠工人阶级和劳动群众。我们愿意通过深入和扩大匈牙利人民共和国民主的途径解决我们祖国面临的一些基本问题。在领导国家工作方面，我们再不允许拉科西—格罗集团反列宁方法、个人崇拜和不关心群众利益的情况复活。我们政府各项措施唯一的目的，是保卫和服务于劳动人民和社会主义的利益。
    我们清楚地懂得，在我们面前还有许多悬而未决的复杂的任务，特别是在经济方面。但是，在继续前进之前，工农革命政府还是忠于我们的原则：在我们人民共和国内建设社会主义是群众的切身事业。
    巩固国家政权和进一步民主化
    声明的第一部分谈的是巩固国家政权和使国家政权进一步民主化。这一部分说：帝国主义者和反革命分子用武装暴动的办法、在暴动失败后又用政治进攻和提出煽动性口号的挑拨活动的办法，集中全部力量要消灭、至少是要瓦解和削弱匈牙利工农国家、它的中央机构和地方机构。与此同时，那些抱着无政府主义的小资产阶级观点和大言不惭地把自己称做马克思主义者的人提出了像“民主化”、“同斯大林主义作斗争”等诸如此类的口号，而他们实际上所抱的目的是要瓦解和破坏我们的国家制度和社会制度。
    在同这种倾向进行的斗争中，我们要以全力来保护和巩固我们社会主义类型的人民民主工农国家的制度和机构，这始终是最为重要的任务，因为只有这样的国家才能体现同农民结成联盟的工人阶级的政权和无产阶级专政，才能保证我们国家的建设和社会主义的彻底胜利。
    我们应当保护和巩固全民所有的工厂、矿井、合作社、国营农场、机器拖拉机站、农民的土地和手工业者劳动所得的财产不受侵犯。我们国家民主化的一个最重要的保证是人民选举的政权机构国民议会和地方会议应该经常举行会议，根据宪法赋予的权利作出决定。
    声明说，应该在行政机构中开展民主化运动，大量裁减人员以简化国家机构，实行中央机构分权，加强行政职能，在政治方面加强行政工作，并且巩固社会主义法制。政府认为匈牙利社会主义工人党是工人阶级的政党，是共产党人的有组织的力量和领导力量；工人阶级的革命政党所领导的爱国人民阵线是团结一切民主力量的组织。
    目前临时性的经济措施
    声明的第二部分谈到目前的临时性经济措施。声明指出，由于事件的发生，被破坏的商品储存价值为十五亿福林，公私建筑物的损失达十亿福林，由于罢工而损失的大约有九十亿福林。声明接着肯定说，我国将克服这些经济困难。“当然，我们愿意接受贷款，即使是资本主义国家提供的贷款，只要这种贷款不附带任何政治条件。”克服这些暂时性困难究竟需要多少时间，这首先取决于我们本身。声明接着列举了经济任务，其中主要的一项是增加煤产量。在煤产量大大增加之前，由于缺乏动力我们将不得不限制某些企业的生产和停止其他某些企业的生产。政府将尽一切力量来消除通货膨胀的威胁。它打算在公共财政方面建立严格的节约制度，提高生产技术水平。政府将努力创造劳动条件。另一方面，它已经在努力采取各种措施以提供各种便利来减轻失业情况。
    工业方面的任务
    声明的第三部分分析了工业方面的任务。政府认为必须首先用一个关于1957年的计划来代替过去准备好的第二个五年计划，以便克服这些暂时性困难。这一计划的主要任务应该是提高劳动者的生活水平。我们无论在工业方面还是在其他方面首先将生产商品，而生产商品的条件在我国比其他国家都有利。最后，政府认为扩大私人手工业和手工业合作社的活动是有益的。
    农业方面的任务
    第四部分讨论农业方面的任务。这一部分首先指出，工农联盟再一次经受住了历史的考验。正如1945年农村劳动者在工人阶级和共产党领导的斗争中取得了土地一样，今天工人阶级和共产党人首先反对反革命，从而帮助农民保卫了他们的土地。政府打算广泛利用农艺学和机械化来加强土地的密集耕作。政府认为农业的社会主义改造是一个头等重要的任务。它将给予劳动农民充分的支持，以便他们在完全自愿的基础上根据他们自己的决定来成立繁荣的合作社。将来，政府仍将发挥国营农场的重要作用，保持机器拖拉机站网，使这些机器拖拉机站也帮助个体农民耕种。
    政府重申决心惩治一切侵犯劳动农民财产、农业生产合作社财产、国营农场财产和机器拖拉机站财产的行为。政府主张简化对农业的领导，宣布准备在某些限制下允许出售土地，但是私人土地不得超过十公顷到十五公顷。政府也允许生产者出租土地和自由出售农产品。政府将设立一种国家土地基金，用来弥补对中农、小农所犯的违法行为。最后，政府愿意使一切生产者有可能提高他们的业务知识。
    商业方面的任务
    第五部分说的是商业方面的任务。声明明确指出：社会主义商业的重要性将来也不会降低。政府认为有必要让私营商业有一定的发展。声明指出：应该在权利完全平等而且互利的基础上建立匈牙利同外国的经济关系。声明说：政府认为对外贸易垄断是社会主义经济的基础之一。
    经济领导方法
    第六部分谈的是经济领导方法。这一部分确定：遵照列宁主义思想的民主集中制是社会主义建设中经济领导的最好方法。但是，中央领导应该限于最根本的问题，而各企业应该享有比以前更大的独立。企业的领导人应该执行工厂工人委员会的合法决议，但是，他也应该拒绝并且阻止执行工人委员会可能作出的违法决定。声明再次指出：工人委员会是生产者通过他们选出的代表而参与领导企业经济的权力机构。
    在文化问题上的态度
    第七部分表明在文化问题上的态度。这一部分指出：政府保证科学工作自由和艺术创作自由，保证尊重科学信念和艺术信念。政府主张加强国际文化交流。政府希望优秀的科学家和专家们自己决定在研究中所采用的方法，并且希望院士们发挥更大的作用来解决国民经济中的各项任务。声明主张施行一种社会主义的爱国主义的和民主的学校教育，使它不受一时的政策的任何表现的干扰。外国语文教育将由学生自愿选择。应该保证最优秀的学生受到中等和高等教育。必须增加教室数目，必须努力恢复民众学校制度。声明指出将要进行大学改革并且在文化领导机关之外建立科学委员会和艺术委员会。迫切需要规定出足以广泛发展文学艺术的实用的组织形式。文化部的任务是从原则上领导文化活动。
    国家和教会的关系
    第八部分谈到国家和教会的关系。这一部分首先肯定：工农革命政府根据宪法的精神，尊重每一公民的信仰自由。政府认为宗教信仰是公民的私人问题。政府允许设立宗教选修课程。政府方面期望的是教会领袖和非教会领袖执行职务时依据完全遵守法律的精神。教会内部如果对宣扬进步政治信仰的人施行歧视，政府认为这是不能容忍的。可能有的分歧，是应该通过协商途径、由国家和教会缔结协议的办法来予以解决。
    对外政策问题
    第九部分谈到的是对外政策问题。政府外交政策的基础是劳动者的国际团结，是同苏联和社会主义阵营一切国家的永恒联盟。我国外交政策的根本原则是：不问社会制度的不同，依据权利平等、国家独立和主权、不干涉内政和互利原则，同一切国家建立产生良好结果的和平关系。声明指出：敌视我国人民和匈牙利人民共和国的人们，竭力对我国同苏联的关系加以不怀好意的叙述。声明对于苏联在第二次世界大战中对解放匈牙利所起的作用，以及苏联对于对付反革命势力所起的作用，表示钦佩。在目前局势中，驻在匈牙利的苏联军队在保卫着匈牙利人民，以防外国帝国主义力量可能进行的武装攻击，从而保证我国人民能够在和平中生活，并且保证我国人民能够把力量贡献给为我国谋求更大幸福的伟大事业。在斯大林的晚年，匈、苏之间的关系上产生了一些问题，由于这些问题没有获得解决，两个兄弟国家之间关系的健康发展受到了阻碍。但是近来这种不健康状态大都已经消除，而且是在一种完全互相谅解的气氛中予以消除的。匈牙利和苏联两国政府都准备通过友好谈判的道路来解决所有目前和将来的关于匈、苏关系的问题（其中包括关于苏军驻在匈牙利的问题），以便使问题的解决符合两国之间的兄弟友好关系和联盟。解决问题的原则基础是按照去年10月30日发表的关于苏联和各人民民主国家关系的宣言所说，尊重无产阶级国际主义、平等、国家主权和民族独立，不干涉内政和互利。
    团结国内进步力量
    声明最后一部分说的是团结国内进步力量。政府宣布准备依据这个文件所指出的政治路线，开始同各党派人士或无党派人士以及专家们进行谈判，以保证一切愿意努力反对反革命势力、努力维护人民事业、保卫社会主义成就、为继续建设社会主义、为国家的繁荣和人民的幸福而斗争的人们，都来参与制定详细计划。政府还准备使他们参加政府。
