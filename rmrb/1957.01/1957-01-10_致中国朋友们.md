To Chinese Friends,

Dear friends,

Long time no see. It has been a long time since you saw us off with warm friendship, and the faces of each of you often appear before our eyes.

We arrived in Amsterdam, where there is also warm friendship.

From December 5th, we decided to visit West Germany, then the Netherlands, Switzerland and England.

Famous painters and museum directors in various countries have organized an exhibition committee for the Atomic Bomb Murals.

Each place will be exhibited for four weeks, so we have scheduled until the summer of 1957, and we will work hard to do it.

This is a beautiful city.

There is a river called the Amstel here. Since ancient times, dams have been built on the river, and several canals have been dug, making full use of the water conservancy and using it to resist the enemy. Therefore, the city is called Amsterdam (dam means dam).

There are many seagulls, and the beech trees are also beautiful. It is a beautiful and ancient city. But somehow it seems depressed and makes people feel sad.

I heard that some people are afraid of war and are buying and hoarding rice in large quantities because this country is afraid of communism.

Wishing you well,

	Akamatsu Toshiko
	(Maruki and Nakabayashi are both well)

Editor's Note: Japanese famous painters Iri Maruki and Toshiko Akamatsu visited China last year and then traveled to Europe. This letter and the sketch below were sent to the "People's Daily" editorial department from distant Amsterdam, Netherlands, at the end of November last year. (Attached picture)

    致中国朋友们
    各位：
    久违了。自从你们以温暖的友情为我们送别以来，又过了很长的时间了，你们每个人的面容都经常浮现在我们眼前。
    我们到了阿姆斯特丹，这里也有着温暖的友情。
    从12月5日起，我们决定去访问西德，然后去荷兰、瑞士和英国。
    各国有名的画家，美术馆馆长们为我们组织了原子弹之图的展览委员会。
    每一地要展览四周，所以我们已排定了到1957年夏天的时间表，我们将努力去作。
    这里是一个美丽的城市。
    这里有一条叫作阿姆斯特的河，自古以来，河上就修筑了水坝，开凿了几条运河，充分地利用了水利，并且据此抗击了敌人。因此，这个城市才叫作阿姆斯特丹（丹，dam，即水坝之意）。
    海鸥很多，榉树也很美。真是一个又美、又古老的城市。但不知怎地却显得抑郁，使人感到哀愁。
    听说也有人害怕发生战事，而大批买米囤积起来，因为这个国家害怕共产主义。
      祝你们好
                赤松俊子
      （丸木、中林都很好）
    编者附记：日本著名画家丸木位里、赤松俊子夫妇去年访问中国后，又到欧洲去旅行。这封信和下面的速写画，是赤松俊子去年十一月底从遥远的荷兰阿姆斯特丹寄给“人民日报”编辑部的。（附图片）
