Editor's Note: The Yingxia Railway, which is of great concern to overseas Chinese, has now been fully completed. Chen Yuanmou, a comrade from the railway engineering corps who participated in the construction of the Yingxia Railway, sent us some letters and poems from overseas Chinese praising the Yingxia Railway and expressing their regards to the military engineers and civilian workers who built the railway. We are publishing a few of them here.

Joint letter from the Burmese Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the Overseas Chinese Business Promotion Association, and the Rangoon Chinese Retailers Association:

    The news that the Yingxia Railway is about to open to traffic is like a spring breeze warming the hearts of overseas Chinese. The heroic deeds that have emerged day and night on the Yingxia Railway are inspiring the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese. When overseas Chinese, who have been away from their hometowns for a long time and have deep feelings for every plant and tree in their ancestral land, return home to visit their relatives in groups, riding the comfortable trains of the motherland and speeding along the railways you have built, appreciating the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland, sweet memories will surge in our hearts, and we will thank you for realizing the dreams of overseas Chinese for many years.

Letter from the thirty-four students of the Spark Class of Rangoon Chinese Middle School in Burma:

    Dear Uncles, whenever the night is quiet, we seem to see thousands of lights shining on the soil of our motherland, and see the long iron dragon galloping back and forth in our hometown, wagging its head and tail for hundreds of kilometers. Uncles, we will remember your designation "Railway Corps" with eternal memory. In our geography notebooks, we will draw a detailed map of the Yingxia Railway, and write on it: "A road to happiness paved with the blood and sweat of thousands of uncles." Uncles, your hearts are connected to our hearts, one hammer from your side, one word of comfort from our side. What are we comforting? Uncles, you have worked hard! We thirty-four heart flowers have been woven into a large fan, waving to you from afar, wishing you less exposure to the scorching sun.

Poems by sixty-seven-year-old Jiang Gongchun and Li Ximai:

	Ten thousand military engineers are full of vigor,
	Chopping mountains is as fast as the wind,
	Bravery can fill the East China Sea,
	Eternally recorded in history for outstanding achievements.

Poem by Wu Peigen, the former principal of Rangoon Chinese Middle School:

	Heroes are resolute in opening up the Fujian territory,
	Benefiting the people with endless joy,
	Steep mountains meander and tunnels are opened,
	Rapid torrents flow and bridges are built,
	North to Beijing and Shanghai to see famous scenic spots,
	South to Xiamen to strengthen national defense,
	Such great achievements will be realized by the end of the year,
	Praising your great achievements and wishing you good health.

    海外侨胞歌颂鹰厦铁路
    编者按：深为海外华侨关心的鹰厦铁路现在已经全线修通。修建鹰厦铁路的铁道兵部队陈远谋同志给我们寄来了一些
    海外华侨歌颂鹰厦铁路、慰问修建鹰厦铁路的军工、民工的信
    件和诗歌。我们在这里发表的是其中的几篇。
    缅甸华商商会、华侨兴商总会、
    仰光华侨门市公会联名信：
    鹰厦铁路快要通车的消息，像春风一样吹暖了侨胞的心；鹰厦铁路上日日夜夜出现的英雄事迹，鼓舞着侨胞们的爱国热情。当久别家乡，对桑梓的一草一木都有着深厚感情的海外侨胞，结伴还乡省亲，坐上祖国舒服的火车，在你们修筑的铁路上奔驶，观赏祖国美丽河山的时候，我们心底会激起甜蜜的回忆，感谢你们实现了侨胞多年来的梦想。
    缅甸仰光中华中学星火班三十四位同学来信：
    亲爱的叔叔们，每当寂静的夜晚，我们就仿佛看到祖国的乡土上闪烁着千里的灯火，看到那长长的铁龙在家乡来回奔驰，摇头摆尾数百公里。叔叔，我们将以永恒的记忆来记住你们的番号“铁道兵”。在地理的作业本上，我们会绘出一幅鹰厦铁路的详图，在上面写着：“千百位叔叔的心血铺出来的幸福道路。”叔叔们，你们的心连着我们的心，你们那边一锤，我们这边一声慰问。慰问什么？叔叔们，你们辛苦了！我们三十四朵心花已编织成一把大扇子，遥遥地向你们挥舞，愿你们少受烈日的曝晒。
    六十七岁的老人——江拱春、李希迈作诗：
    军工十万气如虹，
    挥斩群山快似风，
    英勇堪填东海水，
    永留青史立奇功。
    仰光中华中学老校长吴培根作诗：
    英雄刚毅辟闽疆，
    造福人民乐未央，
    峻岭迂回开隧道，
    急湍奔流架桥梁，
    北通京沪观名胜，
    南下鹭江固国防，
    如此丰功年底现，
    颂君伟绩体安康。
