    “A Working Day of Lenin”
    New Exhibition Hall in the Lenin Museum, Moscow
    The Lenin Museum in Moscow recently opened an exhibition hall called "A Working Day of Lenin." This exhibition hall displays the work of Lenin on a typical working day – February 2, 1921.
    The exhibition hall displays the original manuscripts of documents written and signed by Lenin on this day, as well as original manuscripts of various documents that he carefully revised. For example, the draft on the situation of the People's Commissariat of Education personally drafted by Lenin, a letter to the President of the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute, etc.
    On this day, Lenin did a lot of work. He presided over the meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), at which the outline of the report on the Central Political Education Committee and propaganda work to be submitted to the Tenth Party Congress was reviewed. Lenin reviewed and revised the draft resolution of the Political Bureau on improving the situation of the peasants. On this day, Lenin also attended the meeting of the Labor and Defense Council and signed fourteen resolutions of the Labor and Defense Council, including: the resolution on supplying grain to Donbass; the resolution on ensuring fuel for Petrograd; the resolution on supplying wagon workers transporting timber; the resolution on investigating the responsibility for bureaucracy in the organs of the People's Commissariat of Transportation, etc. On this day, Lenin also served as the chairman of the Economic Commission meeting and attended the meeting of the Small Council of People's Commissars. The exhibition hall also displays a small note that Lenin hastily wrote to his secretary: "I hope to be free between 9 and 10 tonight, and have Vladimirsky call me." (Note: Mikhail Fedorovich Vladimirsky was one of the oldest activists of the Bolshevik Party, then a member of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and a member of the Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee.) This shows that Lenin's work ended very late that day. (Zhang)

    “列宁的一个工作日”
    莫斯科列宁博物馆新辟的展览厅
    莫斯科列宁博物馆最近开辟了一个“列宁的一个工作日”的展览厅。这个展览厅展示列宁一个普通工作日——1921年2月2日——的工作情况。
    展览厅里陈列着列宁在这一天所写的和签署的文件的原稿以及经过他仔细修改过的各种文件的原稿。如列宁亲手起草的关于教育人民委员部的状况的草案，致马克思列宁学院院长的信等。
    这一天，列宁做了许多工作。他主持了俄共（布）中央委员会政治局的会议，在这次会议上审查了向党的第十次代表大会提出的关于中央政治教育委员会和宣传鼓动工作报告的提纲。列宁审阅了政治局关于改善农民状况的决议草案，并且加以修改。这一天列宁还出席了劳动与国防会议的会议，并且签署了劳动与国防会议的十四个决议案，其中有：关于供应顿巴斯粮食的决议；关于保证彼得格勒燃料的决议；关于供应运输木材的马车工人的决议；关于追究交通人民委员部机关中官僚习气的责任的决议等。列宁在这一天还担任经济委员会会议的主席和出席小人民委员会的会议。展览厅里还陈列着列宁匆忙写给他的秘书的一张小条子：“我希望今天晚上九—十点钟的时候有空，让弗拉吉米尔斯基给我打个电话来。”（按：米哈伊尔·费道罗维奇·弗拉吉米尔斯基是布尔什维克党最老的活动家之一，当时是俄共（布）中央委员和全俄中央执行委员会主席团委员。）这说明列宁这一天的工作结束得很晚。（章）
