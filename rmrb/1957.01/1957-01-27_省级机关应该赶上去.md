Provincial Organs Should Catch Up
By our correspondent Zhu Bo

As early as August of last year, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, took overcoming subjectivist ideology and work style as an important task on the ideological front of the Party. At that time, various places had already begun to study the opposition to subjectivism. Since the Eighth National Congress of the Party, the study in various places has become deeper and more widespread. Workers below the county level generally adopted an enthusiastic attitude towards this task, exposing and criticizing the subjectivism and commandism that existed in leading agricultural production and water conservancy work. Therefore, the ideological work style of personnel below the county level has now undergone significant changes. This new atmosphere can be seen everywhere in the rural areas, the connection between rural workers and the masses is closer, and the masses express great satisfaction. The morale of grassroots workers has also undergone great changes, and their work enthusiasm has also increased. They feel that the work is easier to do, and things that were previously considered impossible now have solutions after discussing with the masses. However, workers below the county level raised the following question to the leaders of the provincial agricultural departments: Are our mistakes in subjectivism and commandism in farmland water conservancy work unrelated to the leadership of the provincial agricultural departments?

The reason why the lower-level cadres raised such questions is because the provincial agricultural department, the water conservancy bureau, and other units have serious complacency. They seem to think that this anti-subjectivism campaign is "only for those below, not for those above." Therefore, since the anti-subjectivism study began, the provincial agricultural departments have not only failed to attach importance to it, but even had resistance at the beginning. Some people even closed their eyes and said: "Our problem is not big, and we are not prepared to make a self-criticism." After Chairman Mao proposed at the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to use the method of rectification to oppose subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucracy, the leaders of these departments reluctantly began to conduct self-criticism. The reason why this self-criticism is said to be reluctant is because their complacency still exists, and they are still unclear about the shortcomings in their work. Therefore, the self-criticism is general, neither touching on ideology nor on practical issues, and no explanation has been given to some of the problems raised by the counties.

It should be said that this complacency is blind. If we can dig into the roots of the various subjectivist errors below, we will find that the problem occurs "from top to bottom." The subjectivism of lower-level organs is often unavoidable because it is caused by the subjectivism of higher-level organs. If you don't believe it, look at the facts. Xingping County dug more than 1,000 wells last year, and most of them were abandoned wells. Who came up with this idea that wastes money and manpower? The northern part of Xingping County is a plateau and cannot be used for wells. Most of the areas in the south that can be used for wells are irrigated by canals, and only a few highlands can be used for wells. Even in these highlands, there are many old wells. In this case, in fact, only 500 wells need to be dug, but the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau assigned the task of 1,315 wells. What did the Water Conservancy Bureau base on to assign so many well-digging figures to this county? Did they really understand the actual situation? Of course not. The County People's Committee had objections to this number and raised objections, but the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau did not agree to reduce the number, and even criticized the bottom as "conservative thinking." After the task was assigned, the masses disagreed, but what could the county-level leaders do? Could they disobey the instructions of their superiors? Of course, the county and township cadres had some problems in their work style on this matter, and they also had shortcomings. Therefore, the cadres of this county and township have all made self-criticisms this time, which is correct; but what attitude did the Water Conservancy Bureau, which should be primarily responsible for this matter, take? They did not conduct a self-criticism on this issue.

The Agricultural Department also dares not face up to its own subjectivist errors. But their mistakes are also very obvious. Last year, although Shaanxi Province's agricultural production achievements were the main thing, there were many problems in agricultural production, and some were very serious. For example, the Liquan County had an incident of turning over 16,000 mu of corn seedlings. After the Shaanxi Daily exposed this incident in September, the secretary of the Liquan County Party Committee publicly conducted self-criticism in the newspaper. The district and township cadres in the corn-turning areas also made self-criticisms more than once, but the Agricultural Department did not say a word about this matter. Does the Agricultural Department really have no responsibility? No. At the agriculture, forestry, water, and animal husbandry conference held last spring, the Agricultural Department repeatedly increased the number of mu planted with corn, increasing the county's task of planting corn to 150,000 mu. At that time, the Liquan County leaders who attended the meeting disagreed with this number, but there was no way to reject this task. Later, the county-level leaders felt that there were many difficulties in planting corn, and requested the Baoji Special District to reduce the task. The Special District did not accept this opinion because the Provincial Agricultural Department disagreed and criticized the Liquan County leaders for having conservative ideas. Seeing that the task could not be reduced, the county had to distribute it downward. As a result, due to the large replanting area, insufficient fertilizer, and labor could not be allocated, coupled with the resistance in the minds of many masses, the growth of corn was seriously affected. Among them, 16,000 mu of corn had to be turned over in pain because there was no hope of harvest.

According to the specific situation of Liquan County, it was not appropriate to plant a large amount of corn. Facts have proved that the leadership made a subjectivist mistake, but can this be entirely the responsibility of the county and township cadres? No. Because they did not agree at the beginning, it was only because the Agricultural Department insisted on doing so that they reluctantly agreed. It can be seen that the Provincial Agricultural Department bears the primary responsibility for this matter. What is strange is that now they not only do not admit their mistakes, but also attempt to push the responsibility onto the county-level organs, saying that the county-level leaders should not mechanically copy the instructions of their superiors. Can this reason stand? No. Doesn't the fact clearly show that it is not that the county-level organs want to mechanically copy, but that the Provincial Agricultural Department does not listen to the opinions of the lower level, which makes them have to mechanically copy. To go a step further, even if the lower-level organs made the mistake of mechanically copying, the Agricultural Department also had a fault. Why did they not promptly oppose this mechanical copying? If they knew it at the time and did not correct it in time, it was bureaucracy; if they did not know it at the time, it was even more bureaucracy. Isn't this extremely easy to understand? In the face of such clear facts, the Agricultural Department still does not have the courage to admit its mistakes, which shows that their lack of modesty has reached a considerable degree.

The reason why these leading departments do not have the courage to admit their mistakes is on the one hand because they have not seriously combined with practice to study the "Eighth National Congress" documents; on the other hand, it also shows that they do not fully understand the significance of this anti-subjectivism campaign. They thought that once the leaders admitted their mistakes, there would be "rebellion"; "the work will be difficult to do next year." This is of course groundless. If subjectivism is not eliminated, last year's mistakes will be repeated this year, the leadership situation will not improve, and the work will not be easier to do; only by eliminating subjectivism will fewer mistakes be made this year, the leadership level will be improved, and the work will be easier to do. Will the leaders lose their prestige because they have made self-criticism? In fact, the method of perfunctory and covering up one's own mistakes cannot maintain the leadership's prestige. The reasonable dissatisfaction of the cadres of the lower-level organs with the provincial agricultural organs illustrates this point. Only by humbly listening to the opinions from the lower-level organs and the masses, striving to improve leadership, and overcoming the mistakes of bureaucracy, can the leadership's prestige be improved.

We hope that these provincial organs can catch up in the anti-subjectivism study, so that this study movement can truly achieve results throughout the province.

### 省级机关应该赶上去

    省级机关应该赶上去
    本报记者　朱波
    还在去年8月份，陕西省委根据党中央的指示，就把克服主观主义思想作风作为党在思想战线上一项重要的任务，那时各地已开始了反对主观主义的学习。从党的第八次代表大会之后，各地的学习更深入也更广泛了。县以下工作人员一般地对这一任务采取了热情的态度，对领导农业生产和水利工作中存在着的主观主义和强迫命令的作风，进行了揭发和批判。因此，县以下的工作人员的思想作风现在都有了较显著的转变。在各地农村中到处可以看出这种新的气象，农村工作人员和群众的联系密切了，群众表示很满意。基层工作人员情绪也有了很大的转变，工作积极性也提高了。他们认为工作好做了，过去认为没有办法的事情，现在经过和群众商量之后，感到有了办法。但是，县以下的工作人员对省农业部门领导上提出这样的质问：在农田水利工作中，我们所以犯主观主义和强迫命令的错误，这难道和省农业领导部门没有关系吗？
    下面的干部所以会提出这样的质问是因为省农业厅、水利局等单位存在着严重的自满情绪。他们似乎以为这次反主观主义是“对下不对上的”，因此从反对主观主义学习开展以来，省的农业部门不但不加重视，甚至开始还有抵触情绪。还有的人闭着眼睛说：“我们的问题不大，不准备检讨”。当毛主席在党的八届二中全会上提出将以整风的方法来反对主观主义、宗派主义和官僚主义之后，这些部门的领导才勉强开始进行检讨。说这种检讨是勉强的，是因为他们的自满情绪还存在，他们对自己工作中的缺点还认识不清。因此，检讨是泛泛的，既没有接触思想，也没有接触实际问题，对各县提出来的一些问题也没有作交代。
    应该说，这种自满是盲目的。如果我们能够把下面各种主观主义的错误来挖一下根，就会发现，问题是“自上而下”发生的。下级机关的主观主义所以不能避免，往往是上级机关的主观主义造成的。如果不相信，请看事实。兴平县去年打了一千多口井，而大部分都是废井，这种劳民伤财的事是谁出的主意呢？兴平县北部是高原，不能打井，南部能打井的地区绝大部分是渠浇地，只有少数的高地可以打井，就在这些高地上还有不少的旧井。在这种情况下，实际上只要打五百眼井就可以了，但是，省水利局却分配了一千三百一十五眼井的任务。水利局根据什么分配给这个县这么多的打井数字呢？难道他们真正了解过实际情况吗？当然是没有。县人民委员会对这个数字是有意见的，并且提过意见，可是省水利局不同意削减数字，甚至还批评了下面是“保守思想”。任务分配下去后，群众不同意，可是县一级领导又有什么办法呢？难道他们能够违抗上级的指示吗？当然，县、乡干部在这件事上工作作风有些问题，他们也有缺点，因此，这个县和乡的干部这次都做了检讨，这是对的；但对这件事应负主要责任的水利局采取了什么态度呢？他们对这个问题竟没有进行检讨。
    农业厅也同样不敢正视自己的主观主义错误。可是他们的错误也是十分明显的。去年，陕西省农业生产成绩虽是主要的，但是，农业生产中的问题很多，有的还很严重，例如醴泉县发生了翻掉一万六千亩玉米青苗的事件。陕西日报在9月份揭发了这一事件后，中共醴泉县委书记公开在报纸上进行过自我批评，在翻掉玉米地区的区、乡干部也不只一次地进行过检讨，但是，农业厅对这件事却一言不发。难道农业厅真的没有责任吗？不是的。在去年春季召开的农、林、水、牧会议上，农业厅曾数次增加播种玉米的亩数，使该县播种玉米的任务增加到十五万亩。当时，参加会议的醴泉县领导人员对这个数字是不同意的，但是也没有办法拒绝这个任务。后来，县级领导感到播种玉米确有很多困难，又请求宝鸡专署削减任务，专署没有接受这个意见，其原因就是省农业厅不同意，并且还批评了醴泉县领导上有保守思想。县里看到任务削减不了，只好硬向下分配。结果，由于复种面积大了肥料不够用，劳力支配不过来，再加上很多群众思想上的抗拒，使玉米生长受了严重的影响，其中一万六千亩玉米因收成无望只好忍痛翻掉。
    根据醴泉县的具体情况，大量播种玉米是不合宜的，事实证明领导上犯了主观主义的错误，但这能够完全让县乡干部去负责吗？不能。因为他们开始是不同意的，只是因为农业厅坚持这样做，才硬着头皮答应下来的，可见省农业厅在这件事上负有主要责任。奇怪的是现在他们不但不认错，而且还企图把责任推给县级机关，说是县级领导不应该死搬硬套上级指示。这理由能站得住脚吗？不。事实不是已经清楚地说明，并不是县级机关要死搬硬套，而是省农业厅不好好听取下面意见，才使他们不得不死搬硬套的。退一步说，即使下级机关犯了死搬硬套的错误，农业厅也有过失，为什么他们没有及时反对下面这种死搬硬套的做法呢？如果他们当时知道，而没有及时纠正，这是官僚主义；如果当时竟不知道，那更是官僚主义。这不是极容易理解的吗？在这样明明白白的事实面前，农业厅居然还没有勇气承认自己的错误，可见他们不虚心已到相当严重的程度了。
    这些领导部门所以没有勇气承认错误，一方面说明他们没有认真地结合实际去学习“八大”文件；另一方面也说明他们对这次反主观主义的意义认识不足。他们以为领导上一承认错误，就会“反乱”了；“明年工作不好做”。这当然是毫无根据的。不反掉主观主义，今年又会重犯去年的错误，领导情况不会好转，工作也不会好做；只有反掉了主观主义，今年就会少犯错误，领导水平就会提高，工作也会好做起来。领导上是否因为进行了自我批评就会丧失自己的威信呢？事实上，用搪塞和掩盖自己的错误的方法是无法维持领导威信的，现在下面机关的干部对省级农业机关的合理的不满说明了这一点。只有虚心听取来自下面机关和群众的意见，努力改进领导，克服官僚主义的错误，才是提高领导威信的唯一办法。
    我们希望这些省级机关在反主观主义学习中能够迎头赶上去，这样才能使这次学习运动在全省范围内真正取得成绩。
