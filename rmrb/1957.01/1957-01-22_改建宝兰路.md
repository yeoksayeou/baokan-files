    Rebuilding the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway
    Ke Yulin

    Traveling by train on the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway, one can see groups of workers carrying soil and rocks back and forth amidst the valleys of the Qinling and Longshan mountain ranges, and in the gorges of the Wei River. On the steep cliffs, workers wearing safety belts are brushing away the sliding gravel from the slopes that frequently collapse. As the train passes through the tunnels, the speed is significantly reduced. Looking through the window, one can see lights inside the tunnel, and the faint shadows of movable scaffolding secured with ropes. A group of tunnel workers wearing rattan hats stands at the entrance of the tunnel, looking up and waiting for the train to pass.

    It turns out that the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway is undergoing a comprehensive reconstruction.

    People are concerned about railway construction, but usually, they are concerned about where a new railway is being built. In fact, the reconstruction of old railways is just as important as the construction of new ones. Take the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway, for example. To its west, the newly built Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is extending section by section. However, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is not isolated. To connect the Central Plains with the Northwest, it must be linked to the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway and the Longhai Railway. How much material the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway transports to support the construction of the Northwest depends on how much the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway can transport first. If the old railway cannot meet the standard required by the new railway, the new railway cannot fully play its role.

    The Baoji-Lanzhou Railway is in a situation where its transportation capacity cannot adapt to the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, so people call it the "appendix" of the Northwest railway network.

    In fact, the so-called "appendix" mainly refers to the section from Baoji to Tianshui. This section of the line is over 150 kilometers long and took the Kuomintang government a full six years to build before liberation. Due to improper route selection and blind construction, coupled with the collusion between Kuomintang road builders and contractors who unscrupulously cut corners, the line standards were repeatedly lowered, and the quality of the project was very poor. The entire section was paved with more than fifty kinds of irregular steel rails, and many of the steel beams on the bridges were also dismantled from other lines. Many tunnels were built of brick, without grouting, and were very unstable. The tracks in the stations were also short and could not accommodate many train cars. It is easy to imagine how weak the carrying capacity and how frequent the accidents were on such a piecemeal railway. At that time, a ballad circulated along the line: "Baoji-Tianshui Road, a total mess, either landslides or derailments!"

    As for the section of the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway from Tianshui to Lanzhou, which is over 340 kilometers long, it was built by us in more than two years, more than eight months ahead of the original schedule. This section of the project is of course much stronger than the Baoji-Tianshui section, but at that time, in order to support the construction of the Northwest as soon as possible, some people simply sought speed during the construction, lacking consideration of long-term traffic volume. Therefore, many bridges and culverts were not strong enough, and the freight yards, meeting stations, engine houses, and water supply facilities along the line were relatively simple, affecting train speed and carrying capacity. Sometimes, floods would also cause the line to be cut off.

    Therefore, although the focus of the reconstruction of the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway is on the Baoji-Tianshui section, the Tianshui-Lanzhou section will also undergo appropriate reconstruction.

    In the first few years after liberation, the contradiction between the transportation volume and the transportation capacity of the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway was not easy to see. However, with the rapid development of the national economy and the increasing scale of construction in the Northwest, this contradiction became more and more acute. Take Lanzhou, for example. This is a new industrial base. In 1949, it had only 210,000 people, but by August of last year, it had increased to 600,000. Not only do the building materials and machinery and equipment necessary for industrial construction need to be transported in via the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway, but also the daily necessities for the growing population depend on this railway. With the accelerated development of the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai and the Karamay Oilfield in Xinjiang, and the extension of the laying of rails on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, the transportation tasks borne by this railway are even heavier. According to recent statistics, 400 to 500 train cars of goods need to be transported through the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway every day, but only 300 train cars can actually be transported. Therefore, a lot of materials are piled up in Baoji or Zhengzhou and cannot be transported in, while some projects in the Northwest have to be suspended, and even shortages of certain daily necessities have occurred.

    However, how should the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway be reconstructed? Some detours were taken in the past. Initially, due to the lack of a clear direction, workers were simply sent to repair wherever there was water damage or landslides. Because it was not a fundamental solution, although it could maintain traffic for a while, the diseases continued to occur over time.

    Later, a long-term plan was made, and surveying and design were carried out, and construction was rearranged. However, there were many aspects to the reconstruction: diseases had to be treated, standards had to be raised, and some places had to consider the needs of future electrification. How to distinguish between the current transportation needs and the long-term needs when arranging these reconstruction projects was not well considered. As a result, a lot of work was done, but it did not have the proper effect on solving the urgent need for transportation. In addition, both the design department and the construction department had some small plans. The design department delivered the easier designs for construction first, and the construction department often rushed to do the projects with large output value in order to complete the output value plan. In this way, the transportation capacity of the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway still could not be gradually improved during the reconstruction process as the transportation volume increased.

    Now, the problem of how to reconstruct the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway has been solved. The reconstruction project of the railway should not only treat the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, but also should not ignore the current transportation needs and simply "look at the long term." The reconstruction of a railway should consider future development, and should also plan to meet the current needs of the transportation department, put projects to increase transport capacity first, and put the technical transformation parts such as electrification later.

    The reconstruction project of the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway is being carried out in an all-round way following this direction.

    In the past, I always thought that since the reconstruction project was carried out on the original basis, it would not be as difficult and complex as the construction of a new line. After seeing the Baoji-Lanzhou Road this time, I felt that this view was wrong. From the reconstruction project of the Baoji-Lanzhou Road, it not only has the same scale as the new line construction, such as tunnels, track laying, and station yards, but also has special difficulties that new line construction will not encounter: such as the interference of transportation to construction, and the insufficient supply of materials. According to statistics, there are nearly two hundred water and disease hazards along the Baoji-Lanzhou Road, and each one must be completely treated. From Baoji to Tianshui, only over 150 kilometers, there are more than 130 tunnels that need to be rebuilt and newly built, and more than 160 bridges that must be rebuilt. The tracks of 51 stations along the line need to be extended. However, so many projects must be carried out without affecting traffic. That is to say, construction must be carried out while traffic is running. It is conceivable how tense a battle this is! When the train whistles and speeds past, whether it is the workers in the tunnel who are climbing on the scaffolding to drill holes or set off cannons, whether it is the workers standing on the hillside to clear the slopes, or whether it is the workers building slope protection and retaining walls next to the line, they must stop working and withdraw from the site; and they must also take some time in advance to clean up the site to avoid traffic accidents. The difficulty of transporting materials is even greater. Because this is a busy operating railway, it is often impossible to guarantee the timely supply of materials for the reconstruction project. Sometimes workers have to trek several miles to carry cement by manpower. In order not to delay daily transportation, the workers' labor is extremely tense. Once a landslide occurs, they rush to repair it day and night, often working continuously for more than a dozen hours.

    In order to adapt to the characteristics of the reconstruction project of operating lines and minimize the interference of transportation to construction, workers and technicians have come up with many flexible construction methods, which greatly improved work efficiency. When I passed through Baoji-Lanzhou Road, I found that many steel cable frames were installed in the air of some construction sites, which led to the other side of the mountain. A basket was tied to the steel cable frame, filled with rubble, cement, sand and other materials. These baskets used the natural slope to slide down from the mountain along the steel cable frame all the way to the construction site, constantly transporting materials. The train can pass unobstructed under the steel cable frame without being affected at all. In order to reduce the difficulty of withdrawing tools in the tunnel, the technicians designed a movable arch frame car, which is about the same height and width as the tunnel. A scaffolding is installed on the upper end of the car, and workers can stand on the scaffolding to drill holes and set off cannons. As long as the workers withdraw from the tunnel, the train can safely pass through the middle of the arch frame car. Once the project is completed, the car can also be pushed away.

    After this year's reconstruction, the Baoji-Lanzhou Road can reach the standard of first- and second-class railway trunk lines. The projects for treating water damage and diseases will be completed, which can ensure smooth train traffic without causing line breaks. The tracks of 51 stations will be extended, and several hundred more freight cars can be run every day. It is expected that by May 1st of this year, more than 100 bridges can be strengthened, and 100 kilometers of light rails will be replaced with heavy rails, so that BK1 large locomotives can pass through without obstruction. In the future, electric locomotives will also pass here, and international through transport will be implemented. At that time, the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway will be transformed into a completely new type of railway that meets international standards, and people will no longer mention the scourge of the "appendix."

    改建宝兰路
    柯月霖
    乘车经过宝（鸡）兰（州）铁路，在绵延的秦岭和陇山山脉的山谷间，在渭河的峡谷里，可以看到成群结队挑土、抬石头的工人来回穿梭不停。在陡削的崖壁上，套着安全带的工人，正把经常坍方的陡坡上的滑动砂石刷落下来。火车经过隧道时，速度特别放慢，透过车窗外望，洞内还亮着灯，依稀能看见套着绳索的活动脚手架的阴影。一批戴着藤条帽的隧道工人伫立在洞口，仰首等待火车通过。
    原来宝兰铁路正在全面改建。
    人们都关心铁路的建设，但通常，他们关心的是从哪儿到哪儿又修了一条铁路，或正在修一条铁路。其实，同新建铁路同样重要的，还有旧铁路的改建。拿这条宝兰铁路来说，它的西面，新建的兰新铁路一段一段地向前伸展；可是兰新铁路不是孤立的，它要沟通中原、西北，就要同宝兰铁路、陇海铁路连结起来，兰新铁路运多少支援西北建设的物资，先就需要宝兰铁路运多少过去。旧铁路不能同新铁路站在相适应的水平上，新铁路就不能充分发挥作用。
    宝兰铁路正处在这种运输能力不能同兰新铁路相适应的情况中，所以人们把它叫作西北铁路的“盲肠”。
    其实，所谓“盲肠”主要是指宝鸡至天水的一段。这一段线路全长一百五十多公里，是解放前国民党政府用了整整六年的时间才修成的。由于选线不当和盲目施工，再加上国民党修路人员和包商狼狈为奸，一味偷工减料，线路标准一再降低，工程质量十分低劣。全段竟铺着五十多种杂形钢轨，桥梁上的很多钢梁也是从别的线路上拆下来的，不少隧道是用砖砌的，没有灌过浆，很不牢固，站场的股道也短，车皮多了就放不下。这样一条拼拼凑凑修起来的铁路，通过能力之弱，事故之多，可想而知。当时，沿线流传着这样的歌谣：“宝天路，瞎胡闹，不是坍方就掉道！”
    至于宝兰铁路天水至兰州的一段，全长三百四十余公里，是由我们花了两年多时间，比原定期限提早八个多月修通的。这一段工程，同宝天段相比当然强多了，但当时为了早日支援西北建设，修路时有些单纯图快，缺乏从长远的运量上考虑，因此很多桥涵不够坚固，沿线货场、会让站、机库和给水等设备也比较简陋，影响行车速度和通过能力；有时洪水冲来也会断道。
  因此，宝兰路改建的重点虽然放在宝天段上，天兰段也要进行适当的改建。
    在解放后的头几年，宝兰铁路运量和运输能力之间的矛盾还不怎么容易看得出来；可是，随着国民经济的迅速发展，西北建设的规模日益扩大，这个矛盾就一天比一天尖锐。拿兰州市来说，这是个新兴的工业基地，1949年只有二十一万人，到去年8月，已增加到六十万人。不仅工业建设必需的建筑材料和机器设备需要通过宝兰铁路运进来，日益增长的人民的生活日用品也都依赖着这条铁路。随着青海柴达木盆地和新疆克拉玛依油田的加速开发，兰新铁路铺轨里程的延长，这条铁路负担的运输任务更加繁重。根据最近的统计，每天需要通过宝兰路运输的货物达四、五百车，而实际只能运送三百车。因此，很多物资积压在宝鸡或郑州运不进去，而西北的某些工程却不得不因此停工，甚至发生某些日用品脱销的现象。
    可是，怎样来改建宝兰铁路呢？过去走了一些弯路。最初，由于方针不明确，只是哪里发生水害，哪里坍了方，便调一批工人到哪里去抢修。由于不是根本的整治，虽然能维持通车于一时，日久天长，病害仍继续不断发生。
    后来，有了一个长远的打算，进行了勘测设计，重新安排了施工。可是，改建的内容很多：病害要整治，标准要提高，有些地方还要考虑到将来电气化的需要。怎样区别运输上的当前需要和长远需要来安排这些改建项目，都没有很好的考虑。因而事情做了不少，对解决运输紧张的燃眉之急，却不能收到应有的功效，加上设计部门和施工部门都有些小打算，设计部门
  拣容易设计的先交付施工，施工部门为了完成产值计划，往往也就抢产值大的工程先做。这样，宝兰铁路的运输能力还是不能随着运量的增长在改建过程中逐步提高。
    现在，怎样改建宝兰铁路的问题已经解决了。铁路的改建工程既不能头痛医头、脚痛医脚，也不能忽视目前运输上的需要，一味“从长远看”。改建一条铁路应该看到将来的发展，也应该有计划地满足运输部门当前的需要，把提高运输能力的工程放在首位，把电气化等等技术改造部分往后搁一搁。
    宝兰铁路的改建工程正循着这样的方针全面进行。
    过去，我总认为改建工程既然是在原来的基础上进行，一定不像新线建设那样艰巨、复杂。这次去宝兰路看了以后，才感到这种看法是不对的。从宝兰路的改建工程来看，它不仅具有同新线建设一样的规模，诸如隧道、铺轨、站场等工程几乎无所不包，而且它还有新线施工所不会遇到的特殊困难：例如运输对施工的干扰、材料供应不足等问题。据统计，宝兰路沿线水害病害将近二百处，每一处都得彻底整治。从宝鸡到天水仅一百五十多公里，需要改建和新建的隧道就有一百三十多座，必须进行改造的桥梁达一百六十座以上。全线有五十一个车站需要延长股道。而这样多的工程却要在不影响行车的条件下进行。也就是说，必须一边行车，一边施工。可以想像，这是一场多么紧张的战斗！当火车鸣着汽笛飞驰而过时，不论是隧道内正爬在脚手架上打眼或放炮的工人，不论站在山坡上刷方的工人，不论是在线路旁修建护坡和挡土墙的工人，都得停止工作，撤出现场；而且事先还得腾出一部分时间把现场打扫干净，避免发生行车事故。运输材料困难更多，由于这是条运输繁忙的营业铁路，常常不能保证及时供应改建工程的材料，有时工人得跋涉几里路用人力背运水泥。为了不耽误日常运输，工人们的劳动真是紧张万分，一发生坍方，就夜以继日地抢修，常常连续工作十几小时。
    为了适应营业线路改建工程的特点，尽量减少运输对施工的干扰，工人和技术人员想出了不少灵活的施工方法，大大提高了工作效率。我在宝兰路上经过时，发现在某些工地的上空安装了不少钢架索，一直通向另一边的山头。钢架索上系了一只一只的筐子，里面堆放着片石、水泥、沙土等材料。这些筐子就利用自然坡度从山上沿着钢架索一直滑到工地上，不断地运输着材料。火车在钢架索下面通行无阻，一点也不受到影响。为了减少在隧道内撤出工具的困难，技术人员设计了一种活动拱架车，高、宽和隧道差不多，在车的上端安有脚手架，工人能站在架上打眼、放炮。只要工人从洞内退出，火车就可从拱架车中间安全通过。一旦工程完成，还可以推着车子走。
    经过今年一年的改建，宝兰路就可以达到一、二级铁路干线的标准。整治水害和病害的工程将全部竣工，可以保证火车畅通，不致断道。五十一个车站股道都将延长，每天可以多开几百辆货车。预计在今年5月1日前，可以加固一百多座桥梁，线路将有一百公里的轻型轨换上重型轨，ㄅㄎ1型大型机车从此可通行无阻。将来，这里还将通行电气机车，实行国际联运。到那个时候，宝兰铁路将被改造成一条完全新型的符合国际标准的铁路，人们不会再提起“盲肠”的祸害了。
