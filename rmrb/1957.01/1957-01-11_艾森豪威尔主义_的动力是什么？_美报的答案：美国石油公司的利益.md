Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 9th: American newspapers' commentaries on the "Eisenhower Doctrine" reveal the driving force behind the United States' formulation of a new Middle East policy. The newspapers suggest that the introduction of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is primarily due to concern for the interests of American oil companies. The union newspaper "Labor Daily" pointed out that the American ruling clique is spreading a provocative clamor that obscures the truth, saying that a "vacuum" has emerged in the Middle East. This clamor is, in fact, an attempt to protect the interests of American monopoly capital by force if necessary. If the gendarmes and stranglers who dealt with the Arab Eastern national liberation movement were mainly British and French imperialists in the past, then today, with the British and French positions in the Middle East having been shaken to their foundations, this role has been taken over by the American imperialist bloc.

It can be seen from newspaper reports that the American ruling clique now believes that American diplomatic and military strength should keep pace with the expansion of Rockefeller's and Mellon's investments in Arab Eastern oil fields, and that investments in the Middle East will bring huge profits to American oil companies. In this regard, the American "Aramco" is a clear example. According to the "Wall Street Journal," the company's net profit after taxes in 1955 was as high as $540 million.

The expansion of American oil companies' positions in the Middle East has sharpened the contradictions between the United States and Britain. The "Wall Street Journal" wrote that "the word hatred is not strong enough to express the attitude of many Britons toward 'Aramco.'"

The US government's policy of intervention in the Middle East is not only satisfying to American oil companies, but also to some other American monopoly capital consortia. The "Journal of Commerce" agreed with the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in an editorial, writing that the plan "will give new impetus to defense spending." Henry Alexander, manager of the Mellon Corporation Trust Bank, pointed out in his year-end summary report that tensions in the Middle East and Europe will increase military spending.

### “艾森豪威尔主义”的动力是什么？  美报的答案：美国石油公司的利益

    “艾森豪威尔主义”的动力是什么？
    美报的答案：美国石油公司的利益
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社纽约9日讯：美国报纸对“艾森豪威尔主义”的评论揭露了美国制定新中东政策的动力。报纸暗示，“艾森豪威尔主义”的提出，首先是由于关心美国石油公司的利益。工会报纸“劳工日报”指出，美国统治集团正在散播一种蒙蔽视听的挑衅性叫嚷，说什么中东出现了“真空”的局面。这种叫嚷事实上是企图在必要时用武力来保护美国垄断资本的利益。如果说，以前对付阿拉伯东方民族解放运动的宪兵和扼杀者主要是英法帝国主义者，那么在英法在中东的阵地已经连根动摇的今天，这种角色已经被美帝国主义集团接替过去了。
    从报纸消息中可以看出，现在美国统治集团认为，美国外交和军事实力应当跟上洛克菲勒和梅隆对阿拉伯东方油田投资的扩大，而对中东的投资会给美国石油公司带来巨额利润。在这方面，美国“阿美石油公司”就是一个明显的例子。据“华尔街日报”报道，1955年这家公司纳税后的净利高达五亿四千万美元。
    美国石油公司扩大自己在中东地区的阵地使得美英两国的矛盾尖锐化。“华尔街日报”写道，“用仇恨这个字眼来表达许多英国人对‘阿美石油公司’的态度，还嫌不够劲儿。”
    美国政府干涉中东的政策不但使美国石油公司感到满意，而且也使美国其他某些垄断资本财团感到满意。“商务日报”在一篇社论中赞同“艾森豪威尔主义”，它写道，这个计划“将给予国防开支以新的推动力”。“梅隆公司”信托银行经理亨利·亚历山大在年终总结报告中指出，中东和欧洲的紧张局势将使军事开支增加。
