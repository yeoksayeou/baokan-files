    In a Wooden Sailboat Transport Cooperative
    By our reporter Fan Rongkang
    The Suzhou Creek is still murky, and large and small wooden sailboats shuttle back and forth on the river surface, floating with vegetable leaves, scraps of paper, and other filth. On both sides of the riverbank, many ships returning from long voyages are still moored. At dusk, cooking smoke rises simultaneously, and acrid, unburned firewood smoke billows from small stoves in the stern cabins. At night, the lights flicker dimly. Everything seems the same as before, but it is completely different. This is because the water dwellers of Shanghai have broken free from the road of poverty that has been passed down for generations and have embarked on the path of collectivization.
    Not long ago, I visited the Shanghai Civil Ship Transport Management Office and some of the transport cooperatives it leads. A strange but inspiring scene of life unfolded before me.
    Walking along the Suzhou Creek, I found Wu Baohe, the director of the Fifth Transport Cooperative, in a small bamboo fence house near Guihua Road Bridge. He is an old man, thin and small, worn down by life; only from his clean clothes can it be seen that his life has been good in recent years.
    Wu Baohe is fifty-seven years old this year. He has poled a boat for more than thirty years, but he has not yet earned a piece of plank. He is still a bachelor. When he was young, he certainly thought about getting married like other people. However, he was not only too poor to support himself, but life also taught him this lesson: "People's hearts are separated by their stomachs." Don't believe anyone in the world other than yourself. For a boatman, apart from rowing a scull and pushing a punt pole for a lifetime, don't have any other thoughts. Marry a slightly better wife! There are plenty of hooligans on the docks, afraid of trouble; just marry anyone! But afraid of running away with someone else. By the time of liberation, Wu Baohe was already fifty years old, and getting married seemed a bit late. This old boatman dedicated decades of energy to those boatmen who had suffered for generations on the water. When the cooperative was established, everyone elected him as the director.
    In the Fifth Transport Cooperative, there are also some people whose experiences can best be explained by the example of Liu Xiaoli. Liu Xiaoli's family has been boating since his grandfather's generation. His father was born on a boat and grew old on a boat; he himself was also born on a boat and grew up on a boat. He is now twenty-three years old. Three generations of grandparents and grandchildren, one generation after another, saved every penny and operated a boat, but in the end, they still had no tile above their heads and no land under their feet. All they had was a boat. Having a boat is certainly better than not having one. However, as people say: "The boat boss, the boat boss, gets so anxious he screams like a ghost when it comes to repairing the boat." The annual boat repair is still a serious disaster for Liu Xiaoli's family. One boat repair inevitably leads to a debt. By the time he joined the cooperative, half of the members of the Fifth Cooperative were in debt, the most owing more than 1,700 yuan. This debt, for individual boatmen, is impossible to repay.
    This is the life of the water people: those without a boat hope to have one; those with a boat worry about repairing it. They have been dealing with boats for generations; boats have also tormented them for generations.
    The establishment of cooperatives was only a few months ago. However, for every boatman, boat dweller, and their families, everything is like something that happened yesterday. Because in their lives, in the lives of their ancestors, there was no such thing as establishing a cooperative. During those days, building a cooperative became the center of discussion on the bows and sterns of boats, among men and women. Some hung national flags, portraits of Chairman Mao, and set off firecrackers to welcome joining the cooperative; some cried with joy upon hearing the news that their application to join had been approved. Chen Yonggui and Liu Cuihua, a couple from the Fifth Transport Cooperative, had suffered all their lives and only earned a patched-up garment and a debt of 900 yuan. When they applied to join the cooperative, the cadres of the cooperative preparatory committee boarded the boat to inspect the boat. Liu Cuihua held the cadre's hand and said with tears in her eyes: "Now our roots of poverty are truly pulled out."
    However, there were also some people who could not find answers in their own life experience on how to treat the matter of "joining the cooperative." They hesitated, lingered, and even made up their minds not to join. Xu Lianqing of the Fourth Transport Cooperative, for example, reluctantly guarded his boat, thinking: "I've worked hard all my life to get a boat. If I put a stamp on the application form to join the cooperative, the boat will be gone. I'm determined not to join the cooperative." However, in the end, even people like Xu Lianqing who were "determined not to join the cooperative" saw through the individual boatmen's fate of never being able to escape the "merry-go-round" of repairing boats and owing debts, and chose the path of collectivization.
    Thousands of boats joined the cooperative, and everyone demanded that the cooperative reflect its superiority. Everyone's understanding of superiority was different. Those in debt demanded that the cooperative pay off their debts; those with broken boats demanded that the cooperative repair their boats; those lacking tools demanded that the cooperative add tools for them; those who were sick demanded that the cooperative treat them; those about to give birth demanded that the cooperative no longer let them give birth in small box-like cabins... No matter how strong the superiority of the cooperative, it is impossible to meet so many, diverse requirements in just a few months!
    In the Second Cooperative, two major events occurred.
    The first was the issue of distribution. The Second Cooperative originally adopted the distribution method of "fixed division of flexible value." When joining the cooperative, the level of each person was assessed according to the level of their skills, the strength of their labor intensity, and the quality of their work attitude, and the number of work points for each level was determined. Then, the value of each work point was determined based on the total income of the entire cooperative each month, and distribution was carried out. This is a relatively simple distribution method, which is generally fair; however, the result of its implementation caused a great uproar. It turned out that some people took advantage of this system. Anyway, the levels had been assessed, the work points had been determined, and whether they worked or not, whether they worked more or less, they would get the same amount of money. Some people were half moored and half sailing, taking five days to travel a three-day journey; some people were slow to report back after returning from a voyage. When they received their wages, everyone had different opinions. The director of the cooperative was deeply afraid that if this continued, good members would be corrupted and the cooperative would be brought down. After much deliberation, he implemented a quota distribution system, with more pay for more work, which stabilized people's hearts.
    The second was the issue of boat repair. As soon as they joined the cooperative, everyone demanded to repair their boats; not only to repair them, but also to repair them well and beautifully. The cooperative cadres could not be familiar with the situation of every boat, and they did not conduct investigations and research, so they did not refuse anyone. Sometimes dozens of boats were left ashore for repairs, which not only affected transportation, but also greatly exceeded the repair costs. Once the accounts were calculated, the money borrowed from the bank for boat repairs would not be repaid until 1958. At this time, it was too late to control it. "If you repaired his, why didn't you repair mine?" The cooperative director was often surrounded by such quarrels. The comrades of the Civil Ship Transport Management Office helped the cooperative cadres explain the bottom line to the members: how much money was there in the cooperative for boat repairs, how many boats could be repaired, and could the requirements for boat repairs be met without running the cooperative well? This calmed down the storm.
    Similar things have happened in several cooperatives. These things have shaken the cooperatives, but they have also educated all the members of the cooperatives. It made the members understand that although the cooperative has unparalleled advantages compared to individual farming, it is not a natural treasure trove where you can get whatever you want. All hopes must rely on working hard in the cooperative and running the cooperative well to achieve them. It made the cadres of the cooperatives understand that setting up the cooperative does not mean that everything is fine. Any shortcomings in work or systems can shake the foundation of the cooperative. For the cooperative, what is equally important as improving work is transforming people.
    When I visited these cooperatives, they had already gone through the initial storms and stabilized. Production has developed without exception, and most members have increased their income. The management of the cooperatives has also begun to get on the right track. Some new people and new things are being spread among the members. The superiority of collectivization has been demonstrated in many ways.
    I wanted to find some members to talk about their experiences with collectivization. Tao Zhimao, the director of the Second Cooperative, suggested that I find Zhu Wenshou and Liu Guhua. Tao Zhimao said: The superiority of collectivization is not only manifested in production development, no worries about boat repairs, increased income for members, and guaranteed livelihoods, but also in the fact that if an accident occurs during navigation and the boat is broken, the cooperative can find a solution. Tao Zhimao is also an old boatman. A few years ago, when he worked in the boatmen's association, he personally handled several navigation accidents. At that time, the boatmen were still working individually, and when they encountered such disasters, they simply could not cope. Some borrowed money to repair the boat, and some had to sell the boat planks salvaged from the bottom of the water as firewood, and supported the old and the young to find another way out. Not long ago, Zhu Wenshou and Liu Guhua of the Second Cooperative both capsized their boats, but the situation was different. The cooperative helped them repair the boats. Tao Zhimao said: They will have a deeper understanding of the superiority of collectivization.
    Unfortunately, both Zhu Wenshou and Liu Guhua had gone out to sea. I thought, well, it would be better to find some ordinary members to talk to, maybe it would be more universally meaningful, so I walked over and boarded a semi-new, semi-old wooden boat close to the river bank. There were four adults and five children on this boat. The four adults were Zheng Shengming, Zheng Shengyin, and their wives. In the front cabin, Zheng Shengyin's eldest son was sleeping soundly, covered with a new quilt. In the back cabin, the sisters-in-law were rushing to make cotton clothes for the children. Life seemed to be going okay.
    However, when talking to the Zheng brothers, they had a lot of complaints. Having many children, who are often sick, always makes them feel short of money. Some things in the cooperative also make them dissatisfied. Zheng Shengyin said that the mast on the boat had begun to rot, and the planks were also old, and when he stepped on them, it felt like they were about to break, but the cooperative would not let them be repaired. Tools were also lacking, but the cooperative would not let them be added...
    Listening to them speak, full of complaints, I asked: "Then, there is not much benefit to joining the cooperative!"
    Everyone laughed at this question. Zheng Shengyin said: "You can't say that. Although some things in the cooperative are not handled properly, it is better to be in the cooperative than to work individually. Not to mention anything else, when you join the cooperative, someone will take care of everything, which is much better than working individually."
    Zheng Shengyin's conclusion reflects the objective situation of some cooperatives led by the Shanghai Civil Ship Transport Management Office: although the cooperatives cannot yet meet the requirements of the members, the path of collectivization is already firmly established for most members.

    在木帆船运输合作社里
    本报记者　范荣康
    苏州河还是那样混混沌沌，大大小小的木帆船在漂着菜叶、纸片等秽物的河面上往来如梭，河岸两旁，照旧泊着许多远航归来的船只。黄昏时分，炊烟齐升，一座座后舱小灶里发出呛人的，没有烧透的劈柴的浓烟。入夜，点点灯火若暗若明。一切都好像同过去一样，但又完全同过去不一样。这是因为上海市的水上人家已经摆脱了世代相袭的贫困的道路，走上了合作化的大道。
    不久以前，我访问了上海民船运输管理所和它所领导的一些运输合作社。在我的面前，展开了一幅陌生的、但又是那样激奋人心的生活景象。
    沿着苏州河走去，在归化路桥畔的一座竹篱笆搭成的小房子里，我找到了第五运输合作社的主任吴保和。这是一个给生活折磨得又瘦又小的老人；只有从一身干净的衣服上，还可以看出近年来日子是过得不错的。
    吴保和今年五十七岁了，撑了三十多年的船，还没有挣到一块船板，至今还是一个单身汉。年青的时候，他当然也曾像其他人一样，想到过结婚。可是，他不仅穷得连自己都养不起，而且生活给他这样一种教育：“人心隔肚皮”，世界上除了自己之外，再也不要相信第二个人；对于一个船工说来，除了摇一辈子橹、顶一辈子撑篙之外，再也不要有第二个念头。娶一个好一点的老婆吧！码头上有的是流氓，怕出事；随便娶一个吧！又怕跟别人跑了。赶到解放，吴保和已经是五十岁的人了，结婚好像迟了点。这位老船工把几十年的精力，献给了那些在水上苦了几辈子的船家。成立合作社的时候，大家选他当了主任。
    在第五运输合作社里，还有一些人，他们的遭遇，用刘孝礼的例子来说明，是最妥当的。刘孝礼的一家，从祖父辈上就是撑船的。他的父亲生在船上，老在船上；他自己也是生在船上，长在船上，今年已经二十三岁了，祖孙三代，一辈接着一辈，省吃俭用，经营着一条船，到头来依然是头无片瓦，脚无寸土，他们仅有的，还只是一条船。有船当然比没船强。可是，正像人们所说的那样：“船老大，船老大，一到修船，急得鬼喊”，一年一度的修船，对于刘孝礼一家说来，仍然是一场严重的灾难。修一次船，少不了欠一身债。到参加合作社时，第五合作社有半数社员都欠债，最多的欠一千七百多元。这个债务，对单干船民说来，是永远还不清的。
    水上人家的生活就是这样：没船的，盼着自己有一条船；有船的，愁着修船。他们同船打了几辈子交道；船也苦了他们几辈子。
    建立合作社，已经是几个月以前的事情了。然而，对于每一个船工、船民和他们的家属说来，这一切都同昨天发生的事情一样。因为在他们的生活里，在他们的祖先的生活里，都没有过建立合作社的事情。在那些日子里，建社，成为船头船尾、男男女女议论的中心。有的挂国旗，悬毛主席像，放着鞭炮，迎接入社；有的听到批准入社的消息，高兴得放声痛哭。第五运输合作社陈永桂、刘翠花夫妇俩，苦了一辈子，赚来的只是一件百纳衣和九百元债务。他们申请入社，合作社筹备委员会的干部上船察看船只，刘翠花拉着干部的手，声泪俱下地说道：“这下我们的穷根子真正拔掉了。”
    然而，也有一些人，他们在自己的生活经验里，找不出应该怎样对待“入社”这件事的答案。他们犹豫、傍徨，甚至下过不入社的决心。第四运输合作社的徐连庆，就曾守着自己的船恋恋不舍，心想：“苦了一辈子才弄到一条船，在入社申请书上盖一个章，船就没有了。我是决心不入社的”。可是，最后，就连徐连庆这种“决心不入社”的人，也看透了单干船民永远摆脱不了修船欠债、欠债修船的“走马灯”似的命运，而选择了合作化的道路。
    千百条船只参加了合作社，人人都要求合作社体现优越性，每个人对优越性的理解又都不一样。欠债的，要求合作社替自己还债；船破了的，要求合作社替自己修船；缺少工具的，要求合作社替自己添工具；有病的，要求合作社替自己治病；要生孩子的，要求合作社不再让自己在小匣子似的船舱里生育……合作社的优越性再强，也不可能在短短的几个月里，满足这么多的、各式各样的要求啊！
    在第二合作社，就发生了两件大事。
    第一件是分配问题。第二合作社原来采取“死分活值”的分配方法。在入社时就根据每个人的技术高低，劳动强度的强弱，劳动态度的好坏，评定了等级，确定了每一级的工分是多少，再根据全社每个月的收入多少，来确定每一个工分值多少钱，进行分配。这是一种比较简单的分配方法，大体上说，还是公平的；但实行的结果却引起轩然大波。原来有些人钻了这个制度的空子。反正等级评过了，工分确定了，干不干、干多干少，一样拿钱，有的便半泊半航，三天的路程五天才赶到；有的航行归来，迟迟不去报到。领工资时，大家意见纷纷。社主任深怕这样下去，好社员也给带坏了，合作社会给搞垮；经过千思百虑，实行了定额分配制度，多劳多得，才稳定了人心。
    第二件是修船问题。一参加合作社，人人都要求修船；不但要修，而且要修得好，修得漂亮。社干部不可能熟悉每一条船的情况，又没有调查研究，来者不拒，有时候几十条船搁在岸上修，不但影响运输，而且修船费大大超支。一算账，向银行贷来修船的钱，要到1958年才能还清。这时候，想控制一下也来不及了。“修了他的，为什么不修我的？”社主任的周围，经常是这样的争吵。民船运输管理所的同志帮社干部向社员们交了底：社里有多少修船费，能修多少船，不办好合作社能不能满足修船的要求？这才把一场风波平息下去。
    类似这样的事情，在几个合作社里都曾经发生过。这些事情曾经动摇过合作社，但也教育了合作社的全体成员。它使社员们懂得，合作社比起单干来虽有无比的优越性，却不是一座天然的宝山，可以要什么就得到什么，一切希望都要依靠在合作社里好好劳动，把合作社办好才能做到；它使得合作社的干部们懂得，合作社办起来了，并不等于万事大吉，任何工作上，制度上的缺点，都可能动摇合作社的基础，对于合作社说来，同改进工作同样重要的，是改造人。
    我去访问这些合作社的时候，这些合作社已经经历了最初的风暴，稳定下来。生产毫无例外地都有了发展，大部分社员增加了收入。合作社的管理也开始走上正轨。一些新人新事，在社员中间传诵着。合作化的优越性已经多方面地显示出来。
    我想找一些社员谈谈他们对合作化的体会。第二合作社的主任陶芝茂建议我去找找朱文寿和刘古华。陶芝茂说：合作化的优越性除了表现在生产发展，修船不愁，社员收入增加，生活有保障等方面以外，还表现在万一航行中出了事故，把船撞破了，合作社可以想办法。陶芝茂也是一个老船民。前几年他在船民协会工作时，曾经亲手处理过几件航行事故。那时候船民还是单干的，遇到这种灾难，简直没法应付。有的借债修船，有的只得把从水底捞起来的船板当劈柴卖了，扶老携幼，另找出路。不久之前，第二合作社的朱文寿和刘古华都翻了船，情况就不一样了。合作社帮他们修好了船。陶芝茂说：他们对合作化的优越性会体会得更深些。
    不凑巧，朱文寿和刘古华都出航去了。我想，也好，随便找些普通的社员谈谈，也许更有普遍意义，便信步走去，跨上一只紧靠河岸的、半新半旧的木船。这船上共有四个大人、五个小孩。四个大人，是郑盛铭、郑盛银兄弟俩和他们的妻子。前舱里，熟睡着郑盛银的大儿子，身上盖着一床新棉絮的被子，后舱里，妯娌俩给孩子们赶做棉衣。日子过得像是还可以。
    可是，同郑家兄弟谈起来，他们的牢骚还不少。孩子多，又常闹病，总使他们觉得钱少。合作社里的一些事情，也让他们不满。郑盛银说船上的桅杆已经开始烂了，船板也老了，踩上去，像是要断一样，可是社里不让修。工具也缺，社里也不让添……
    听他们说话，牢骚满腹，我就问道：“那么，参加合作社也没有多大好处啦！”
    这一问，大家都笑了。郑盛银说：“话不能这么讲。合作社有些事情虽办得不妥，在社总比单干强。不说别的，入了社，什么事情都有人管，这就比单干强多了。”
    郑盛银的这个结论，倒是反映了上海民船运输管理所领导的一些合作社的客观情况：尽管合作社还不能满足社员们的要求，但走合作化的道路，对大多数社员说来，已经是坚定不移的了。
