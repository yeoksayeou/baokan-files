    Learning from Mistakes
    Letter from Guangdong Branch of the People's Bank of China: The criticism in the article "Unaccountable Construction Plan" published on page two of the People's Daily on August 15, 1956, was correct. The main personnel in charge of our branch have submitted written self-criticisms and learned from it, guaranteeing that similar situations will not occur in the future.
