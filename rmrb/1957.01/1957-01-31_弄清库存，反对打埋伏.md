    Clarify Inventory, Oppose Ambush
    Commentator of this newspaper
    Currently, our country is facing difficulties in industrial production and capital construction due to insufficient supply of raw materials. Under these circumstances, many factories, mines, enterprises, and capital construction units can ensure the needs of production and capital construction by verifying needs, carefully budgeting, reducing consumption quotas, continuing to investigate inventories, and organizing mutual adjustments. However, many enterprises and units have problems with their attitude towards the work of inventory verification. When conducting a general survey of inventory materials as of October 1, 1956, a sample survey of eighty-eight enterprises conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics revealed that more than thirty enterprises had phenomena such as underreporting, concealing, and misreporting inventory materials. Spot checks of warehouses in some enterprises by the national supervisory authorities and economic planning departments also revealed serious inaccuracies in the reporting of inventory materials. The more common phenomena included: the book figure being smaller than the actual inventory figure; the figure reported to the directly superior authorities being smaller than the book figure; and the figure reported to the National Bureau of Statistics being smaller than the figure reported to the directly superior authorities. The Daye Branch of the Wuhan Metallurgical Construction General Company had an inventory of 1,012 tons of steel, but only reported 556 tons when filling out the forms. A processing plant under this branch actually had 720 tons of various types of steel, but only reported 156 tons when filling out the forms. The Second Engineering Area of the Taiyuan Municipal Engineering Company underreported 4,646 bags of cement when filling out the inventory situation, accounting for 42% of the total cement inventory reported by this engineering area. The Zhangjiakou Mining Machinery Plant underreported more than 100 tons of the eight types of steel that were checked. The Changsha Machine Tool Plant had nine types of steel that were underreported by more than twice the reported figure. Preliminary statistics from a recent sample survey of sixteen units in Beijing showed an underreporting of more than 1,500 tons of steel, nearly 15,000 cubic meters of logs and planks, and more than 7,800 tons of cement. Several engineering bureaus under the Ministry of Railways underreported more than 2,000 tons of steel rails. The Guanghua Timber Factory had an inventory of more than 15,000 cubic meters of various types of timber, but only reported more than 12,000 cubic meters.

    The results of the inspection proved that the material reserves of many units greatly exceeded the quota, but they were also clamoring for a lack of raw materials. The Second Ministry of Machine Building inspected 21 affiliated units and found that, in addition to reasonable inventory materials, there were also more than 22,270 tons of surplus ferrous metal materials and more than 2,410 tons of surplus non-ferrous metal materials. When applying for materials from the state in 1956, the Guangzhou General Machinery Factory requested 20% more metal materials. The Shenyang Machine Tool Plant requested 40% more, and some enterprises even requested more than 50%. The inventory materials of state-owned enterprises in Shenyang exceeded the storage quota by more than 20%. The total value of various raw materials accumulated by state-owned enterprises in Shenyang was more than 40 million yuan, of which more than 30 million yuan of raw materials had been accumulated for as long as three years.

    Why do these chaotic phenomena occur in the material supply work? Judging from the various situations revealed by the inspection, there are many reasons. A few enterprises adopt a perfunctory attitude towards the work of checking inventory materials and filling in the inventory numbers. What exactly is in their warehouses and how much there is is originally a mess, so they fill in and report casually, but always underreport. Some enterprises and units also have inaccurate reports of inventory materials due to the low professional level of grassroots statistics workers, who are unclear about what should be filled in and what should not be filled in, and the leaders turn a blind eye to it. Worse, some units have a serious departmentalism in the minds of some leading personnel, and intentionally lay an ambush. In order to ask the state for more things and make it convenient for themselves to use, they deliberately exaggerate consumption quotas and try to underreport inventories. When some enterprises and units hear the news that someone is coming to check the warehouse, they rush to organize a response: some send the surplus inventory materials to the workshop and draw a few lines on them to make them look like work in progress; some units send the surplus inventory materials to other units for safekeeping; some units even bury the surplus materials to avoid inspection. In order to prevent the National Bureau of Statistics from discovering that they had surplus materials, the Seventh Bureau of the Second Ministry of Machine Building even deleted all the accounts of more than 500 tons of steel and more than 50 tons of cement that were surplus in the basic construction of grassroots units when filling in the inventory status.

    As everyone knows, under the current situation of insufficient various raw materials, the quality of material supply work and the rationality of raw material reserves directly affect the development of production and the progress of capital construction. Precisely because raw materials are insufficient, the mutual adjustment and scheduling between enterprises need to be more flexible, and the inventory reserve needs to be more reasonable. Insufficient or too little reserve will cause losses due to work stoppages waiting for materials, and excessive reserve will cause accumulation of raw materials, which will reduce the speed of enterprise capital turnover and affect the production of other departments, which will also bring losses to the national construction cause. Therefore, clarifying the inventory, understanding the family property, and enabling the national material distribution department and the enterprise management department to accurately grasp the distribution status of the existing national materials, and make planned and reasonable arrangements based on this, is an important measure to eliminate the current shortage of raw materials and the phenomena of more here and less there, surplus and shortage. At the same time, through the inventory of materials, the enterprise leaders can understand the family property of their own unit, which is also of great benefit to fully exerting and utilizing the potential strength within the enterprise, better organizing production and capital construction construction, and improving the enterprise management level. Therefore, in the inventory of materials, that kind of departmentalism that lays an ambush is extremely harmful and must be corrected. Now the Ministry of Supervision, the State Economic Commission, and the State Statistical Bureau are conducting a re-examination of the general survey of inventory materials as of January 1, 1957. It is hoped that the competent departments of enterprises and the enterprises themselves can seriously cooperate to do this work well.

    There are also some problems in the material supply system that need to be solved urgently. For example, at present, the number of days of raw material reserves is different for each enterprise unit using raw materials. For the same raw materials, some enterprise units stipulate half a year for domestic products and one year for foreign products. Some enterprise units stipulate three months for domestic products and half a year for foreign products. Some enterprise units stipulate 100 days for domestic products and 270 days for foreign products. The approval principle of the department in charge of material approval is generally 30 or 50 days for domestic products and 90 or 120 days for foreign products. Another example is the quota for requesting raw materials, which has not yet been clearly stipulated. Due to the low level of quota management of enterprises, although the quantity of raw materials should be applied for based on the consumption quota calculated by scientific technology, only a very few enterprises can do this at present, and most enterprise units only apply based on past consumption. There are also many enterprises that even roughly estimate it and use the estimated figure as the basis for applying for raw materials. The production and supply departments have also been unable to supply according to plan, specifications, and varieties for a long time, and what is needed does not come when it is needed, but what is not needed comes instead. Since these fundamental problems have not been solved so far, the application and reserve of raw materials do not have an accurate basis. The units applying for raw materials are often worried that the approval department will give less, so they hope to receive more; and the approval department often thinks that the enterprise units always ask for more, so they cut it across the board. This to some extent contributes to the chaos in the material supply work. Therefore, while conscientiously correcting the departmentalism and ambushing behavior of some enterprise units in the material supply work, it is also hoped that the relevant departments can pay attention to solving these system problems and strengthen quota management work at all levels, so as to fundamentally eliminate the chaotic phenomena in the material supply work.

    弄清库存，反对打埋伏
    本报评论员
    目前，我国在工业生产和基本建设当中，存在着原材料供应不足的困难。在这种情况下，许多厂矿企业和基本建设单位，都能从核实需要，精打细算，降低消耗定额，继续查清库存，组织互相调剂等方面，来保证生产和基本建设的需要。但也有不少企业单位，在对待清查物资这一工作的态度上是有问题的。在对1956年10月1日的库存物资进行普查的时候，国家统计部门抽查的八十八个企业单位中，就有三十多个企业存在着漏报、隐瞒不报和错报库存物资等现象。国家监察机关和经济计划部门抽查部分企业的仓库，也同样发现了填报库存物资严重不实的现象。这中间比较普遍的是：帐面数字小于库存实物数字；向直属上级机关报告的数字，小于帐面数字；向国家统计部门报告的数字，又小于向直属上级机关报告的数字。武汉冶金建筑总公司所属大冶分公司，库存钢材一千零十二吨，但在填报时却只报了五百五十六吨；这个分公司的一个加工厂，实有各种钢材七百二十吨，填报时只报了一百五十六吨。太原市政工程公司二工区在填报库存物资情况时，少报了四千六百四十六袋水泥，占这个工区上报库存水泥总数的42％。张家口矿山机械厂被检查的八种钢材，就少报了一百多吨。长沙机床厂有九种钢材漏报比上报的数字多两倍以上。最近在北京市抽查的十六个单位初步统计，漏报钢材一千五百多吨，原木、板材近一万五千立方公尺，水泥七千八百多吨。铁道部几个工程局就漏报了二千多吨钢轨。光华木材厂，库存各种木材有一万五千多立方公尺，只报了一万二千多立方公尺。
    检查的结果证明：不少单位的物资储备大大超过定额，但他们也在吵嚷缺乏原材料。第二机械工业部检查所属二十一个单位中，有十五个单位除去合理库存物资以外，还多余黑色金属材料二万二千二百七十多吨，多余有色金属材料二千四百一十多吨。广州通用机器厂1956年向国家申请物资时，就多要了20％的金属材料。沈阳机床厂多要了40％，有的企业甚至多要50％以上。沈阳市国营企业的库存物资，都超过储存定额20％以上。沈阳市国营企业积压的各种原材料总值有四千多万元，其中有三千多万元的原材料，已积压达三年之久。
    为什么在物资供应工作上会产生上述这些混乱现象呢？从检查出来的各种情况看来，原因是很多的。有少数企业对于检查库存物资和填报库存数目的工作采取敷衍塞责的态度，他们的仓库里究竟有些什么东西，有多少，本来就是一笔糊涂帐，于是，他们就随便填随便报，但总是少报。也有些企业单位由于基层统计工作人员业务水平低，什么应该填报，什么不应该填报，他们混淆不清，领导人员听之任之，也造成了库存物资报告不实的恶果。更糟的是，有一些单位由于部分领导人员存着严重的本位主义思想，有意地打埋伏。他们为了向国家多要东西，在使自己用起来方便，便故意夸大消耗定额，尽量少报库存。有些企业单位在听到有人要来检查仓库的消息的时候，就急急忙忙组织应付：有的把多余的库存物资送到车间里，画上几条线当成在制品；有的单位把多余的库存物资送到其他单位去寄存起来；有的单位甚至把多余物资埋藏起来，以逃避检查。第二机械工业部第七局，为了不让国家统计部门发觉他们有多余物资，在填报库存物资状况的时候，甚至把基层单位在基本建设中多余的五百多吨钢材和五十多吨水泥的帐目全部删掉了。
    大家知道，在目前各种原材料不足的情况下，物资供应工作的好坏，原材料储备的合理与否，都直接影响着生产的发展和基本建设的施工进度。正因为原材料不足，各企业之间的互相调剂、调度就需要更加灵活，库存储备量也需要更加合理。储备量不足或过少，会造成停工待料的损失，储备量过多，就会造成原材料积压，就会降低企业资金周转速度，并且影响别部门的生产，都同样会给国家建设事业带来损失。所以，查清库存、摸清家底，让国家物资分配部门和企业主管部门确切地掌握国家现有物资分布状况，并据以有计划地合理地进行安排，是消除当前原材料不足和此多彼少、余缺不均等现象的一种重要措施。同时，通过库存物资的清查，使企业领导者摸清本单位的家底，对于充分地发挥和利用企业内部潜在力量，更好地组织生产和基本建设施工，使企业管理水平提高一步，也是大有好处的。因此，在清查物资的时候，那种打埋伏的本位主义思想是极端有害的，也是必须纠正的。现在监察部、国家经济委员会、国家统计局正在对1957年1月1日的库存材料普查进行复查，希望各企业主管部门和企业本身，都能认真地配合作好这一工作。
    在物资供应制度方面，也存在着一些亟待解决的问题。例如，目前各使用原材料的企业单位，对于原材料储备的天数就各行其是。同样的原材料，有的企业单位规定国内产品半年，国外产品一年。有的企业单位规定国内产品三个月，国外产品半年。有的企业单位规定国内产品一百天，国外产品二百七十天。而掌握物资审批部门的审批原则，一般是国内产品三十或五十天，国外产品九十或一百二十天。又例如原材料请领定额，至今也没有明确的规定。由于企业定额管理水平不高，虽说原材料数量应根据科学的技术计算的消耗定额申请，可是目前能够这样做的只是极少数企业，而大多数企业单位只是根据以往消耗情况申请。也还有不少企业甚至是大体上估算一下，拿估算的数字作申请原材料的依据。而生产和供应部门又长期不能按计划按规格按品种供应，需要的到时不来，不要的反而来了。由于这些带有根本性的问题至今没有解决，原材料的申请和储备没有准确的根据，申请原材料的单位常常耽心审批部门少给，就希望多领；而审批部门往往又认为企业单位总是多要，就一律削减。这就在某种程度上助长了物资供应工作中的混乱。因此，在认真地纠正部分企业单位对于物资供应工作的本位主义思想和打埋伏的行为的同时，也希望有关部门能注意解决这些制度问题，逐级负责加强定额管理工作，以利于从根本上消除物资供应工作中的混乱现象。
