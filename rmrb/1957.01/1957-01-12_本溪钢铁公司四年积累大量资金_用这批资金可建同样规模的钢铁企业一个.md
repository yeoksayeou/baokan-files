Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, 10th. Over the past four years, the total amount of profits, depreciation fees, and taxes turned over to the state by Benxi Iron and Steel Company is almost enough to build a steel enterprise of the same scale as the company's existing factories and mines.

While leveraging its production capacity, Benxi Iron and Steel Company has reduced costs and conserved working capital. Last year, Benxi Steel Plant's steel output was more than three times that of 1952. The blast furnace utilization coefficient of the iron smelting plant reached the technical and economic indicator stipulated in the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule last year. Benxi Iron and Steel Company's product costs were reduced by 17.45% last year compared to the previous year. The company's total output value last year increased by 56% compared to 1955. Due to the active establishment of a responsibility system for fund management and the handling of stockpiled materials, the working capital used last year was actually 19% less than in 1955, saving a total of more than 10 million yuan in working capital throughout the year.

    本溪钢铁公司四年积累大量资金
    用这批资金可建同样规模的钢铁企业一个
    新华社本溪10日电　本溪钢铁公司过去四年里上缴给国家的利润、折旧费和税金的总数，几乎可以建设和这个公司现有厂矿规模相同的钢铁企业。
    本溪钢铁公司在发挥企业生产能力的同时，降低了成本和节约了流动资金。去年，本溪钢厂钢的产量相当于1952年的三倍多。炼铁厂高炉利用系数在去年提前达到了五年计划规定的这项技术经济指标。本溪钢铁公司产品成本去年比前年降低了17.45％。这个公司去年总产值比1955年增加了56％，由于积极建立资金分管责任制和处理了积压物资，去年的流动资金反比1955年少用了19％，去年全年共节约了流动资金一千多万元。
