    Steel Girders for Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Completed Ahead of Schedule

    (Our report) The three-span nine-bay steel girders for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, manufactured by the Shanhaiguan and Shenyang Bridge Factories, have been completed three months ahead of schedule. 94% of the products have already been sent to the construction site, and the remainder will be shipped out within January. This provides favorable conditions for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge to open to traffic on National Day.

    The steel girders for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge are three-span continuous truss girders with a span of 128 meters each. In order to facilitate on-site erection, it is required that all welded parts with the same number be interchangeable. With the help of Soviet expert Comrade Polyakov, the Shenyang Bridge Factory adopted advanced production tools such as hole-free assembly fixtures, fixed machine templates, and fixed assembly forms, overcoming many technical difficulties.

    In the process of manufacturing the steel girders, the workers' enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high. Each work group in the Shenyang Bridge Factory put forward guarantees, which have now all been realized. The employees of the Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory put forward a total of 315 rationalization proposals, learned 23 kinds of advanced technologies, saved 434 tons of steel, and reduced costs by 10.78%. 445 employees were rated as advanced producers, and 45 groups were rated as advanced groups.

    The quality of the steel girders for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has been proven to fully meet the technical standards stipulated in the design after factory trial assembly and on-site erection.

    武汉长江大桥钢梁提前制成
    本报讯　山海关和沈阳桥梁工厂为武汉长江大桥制造的三联九孔钢梁已经提前三个月完成。其中94％的产品已经发往工地，剩下的在1月份内即可全部发出。这对武汉长江大桥国庆节通车，提供了有利的条件。
    武汉长江大桥钢梁，是每孔跨度达一百二十八公尺的三孔连续桁梁。为了便于工地架设，要求所有同一编号的焊件做到可以互换使用。沈阳桥梁工厂在苏联专家波良可夫同志的帮助下，采用了无孔拼装卡具、固定式机器样钣、固定式拼装胎型等先进生产工具，克服了很多技术上的困难。
    在制造钢梁过程中，工人的生产积极性空前高涨。沈阳桥梁工厂各个工组都提出了保证，现在已经全部实现。山海关桥梁工厂职工共计提出三百一十五件合理化建议，学习了二十三种先进技术；节约钢材四百三十四吨，成本降低10.78％。有四百四十五名职工被评为先进生产者，有四十五个小组被评为先进小组。
    武汉长江大桥的钢梁经过工厂试拼和工地架设证明，质量完全达到了设计规定的技术标准。
