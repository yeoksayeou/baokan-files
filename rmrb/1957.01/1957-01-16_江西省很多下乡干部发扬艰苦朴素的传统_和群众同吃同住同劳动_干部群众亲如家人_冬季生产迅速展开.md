Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, January 15th: After a large number of cadres from the leadership organs of the Jiangxi Province's Ji'an, Nanchang, Fuzhou prefectures and their subordinate counties were transferred to strengthen the leadership at the grassroots level, they encouraged and improved the working confidence of grassroots cadres, and a new atmosphere began to appear in rural work.

Of the more than 1,400 cadres transferred to the townships in Ji'an Prefecture, most are able to work diligently. Many cadres have expressed their intention to work in the countryside for the rest of their lives and build a new socialist countryside together with the masses. Many people, after arriving in the townships, immediately began to study the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives and the preparation of winter production with the original township and commune cadres. In some townships, the masses, upon learning that the cadres who had previously led them in land reform and the organization of agricultural cooperatives had returned to the township, went to welcome them with gongs and drums. Township cadres of Dunhou Township, Ji'an County, said: "These capable cadres have returned, and it will be easier for us to work in the future." After the cadres of Yichun, Fengcheng and other counties in Nanchang Prefecture went to the countryside, they mostly carried forward the tradition of hard work and plain living from the land reform period, and "ate, lived, and worked with the masses." For example, Zheng Yicheng, Deputy Minister of the Industry Department of the Yichun County Party Committee, and Liu Guorui, former Secretary of the Zhuting District Party Committee, not only specifically helped grassroots cadres arrange the current work, but also went to the fields themselves to lead the masses in winter production. Before and after the New Year, Yichun County transferred 148 cadres to strengthen the leadership at the grassroots level, which effectively promoted the current consolidation of cooperatives and winter production. Now, the county has launched a winter plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and water conservancy construction campaign in conjunction with the work of consolidating cooperatives. In De'an County, Jiujiang Prefecture, which had a bumper harvest last year, winter production was once very slow. Many members of agricultural cooperatives believed that "this year's bumper harvest is enough to eat," and they were not enthusiastic about winter production. By December of last year, the county had only accumulated more than 150,000 dan of fertilizer; not many water conservancy projects had started; and the field management of winter crops was very poor, with only 35% of the crops fertilized. After the New Year, the De'an County Party Committee quickly transferred 75 cadres. In addition to 21 people serving as township party branch secretaries, the rest were stationed directly in agricultural cooperatives. According to the instructions of the county party committee, they analyzed the reasons why winter production was not carried out well together with the original commune cadres. They then mobilized commune members to summarize the production of 1956, so that the members realized that the reason for the bumper harvest was that more water conservancy projects were repaired and more fertilizer was accumulated. This quickly overcame the members' slack thinking and set off a climax of winter production. In the last half month alone, according to statistics from seven townships, more than 100 small water conservancy projects have been started, and the county has accumulated a total of more than 800,000 dan of fertilizer, and 60% of the winter crops have been fertilized.

    News from this newspaper: According to the Jiangxi Daily, in December 1956, the Fengcheng County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party transferred more than 230 cadres from county-level organs to the countryside to strengthen the leadership of townships and communes. The vast majority of them were settled in rural work and carried forward the tradition of "sharing weal and woe" with the masses. After they went to the countryside, they ate, lived, and worked with the masses, and were as close as family, which encouraged the production enthusiasm of the peasant masses.

    Wang Xiaotian, a cadre of the People's Bank of Fengcheng County, lacked experience in rural work. However, on his first day in the countryside, he went to the fields to learn how to shovel field ridges and plow fields from agricultural cooperative members. His hands were blistered. In the joint labor, he established a deep friendship with the peasants, mobilized the peasants to collect the early rice stalks that had not been collected for several months, and completed the frost protection work for winter crops and the plowing of more than 200 mu of late fields.

    Duan Ganli, Director of the Bureau of Culture and Education of Fengcheng County, had not worked in the countryside for several years. This time he went to work in the Renmin Township of Hehu District, which had always been considered backward. In the process of eating, living, and working with the masses, he cultivated the deputy director of the Xinhua Second Cooperative in the township and promoted the work of the entire cooperative. In visiting the masses, he found that a 14-year-old orphan named Liu was still wearing a single pair of trousers, and he reported the situation to the district and asked for a solution. These things greatly moved the rural cadres and the masses, who expressed their intention to work harder to improve agricultural production. Now, the work of each agricultural cooperative in this township has been specifically arranged. People who went out blindly to engage in sideline businesses returned home one after another. The face of the backward township is gradually changing.

    The down-to-earth style of the cadres who went to the countryside greatly moved and educated some local township and commune cadres who were unwilling to work hard. The township cadres of Qujiang Township, Shangzhuang District, and the directors of five agricultural cooperatives had not participated in production for a year. In the past, they spent most of their time sitting in the offices of the township and commune. Occasionally, when they went to the fields, they would point fingers and check. Xia Yuesheng and Xiong Hezai, the directors of the Meiman Cooperative and the Shengli Cooperative in the township, only did 50 work points from November 1955 to the end of 1956. The masses ridiculed them as "commune officials." When they saw that Jiang Wanzai, a cadre who came to work in the township this time, helped the masses carry pond mud, they said with emotion: "The people sent by the higher authorities are so integrated with the masses, and we who originally worked in the countryside should work harder." They went out of the office one after another and led the members to carry pond mud without fear of the cold. The Meiman Cooperative carried more than 40,000 dan of pond mud in just ten days, which was more than it had carried in the previous month and a half. In Tuochuanbu District, because the vast majority of township and commune cadres participated in production, the enthusiasm of the masses followed suit, and winter production unfolded rapidly. In eleven days, more than 1.1 million dan of pond mud was accumulated, and the earthwork for repairing dikes increased from more than 5,000 cubic meters per day to nearly 10,000 cubic meters.

    江西省很多下乡干部发扬艰苦朴素的传统
    和群众同吃同住同劳动
    干部群众亲如家人　冬季生产迅速展开
    新华社南昌15日电　江西省吉安、南昌、抚州等专区和所属各县领导机关下调大批干部充实基层领导力量后，鼓舞和提高了基层干部的工作信心，农村工作开始出现新气象。
    吉安专区下调到乡的一千四百多名干部，大都能深入艰苦地进行工作。许多干部表示要在农村工作一辈子，和群众一道建设好社会主义的新农村。许多人入乡后，刚放下背包就和原来的乡、社干部一起研究整顿巩固农业社和做好冬季生产的工作。有些乡的群众在知道过去领导他们进行土地改革和组织农业社的干部又回乡的消息后，都敲锣打鼓去迎接他们。吉安县敦厚乡的乡干部说：这些能力强的干部又回来了，以后我们工作好办了。南昌专区宜春、丰城等县干部下乡后，大都发扬过去土地改革时期艰苦朴素的工作作风，和群众“同吃、同住、同劳动。”如中共宜春县委工业部副部长郑益成和前竹亭区区委书记刘国瑞下乡后，不但具体帮助基层干部安排好当前工作，还自己下田带动群众进行冬季生产。宜春县在新年前后下调了一百四十八名干部充实基层领导，有力地推动了当前整社和冬季生产工作。现在全县结合整社工作已掀起冬耕、积肥、兴修水利的运动。去年获得丰收的九江专区德安县，冬季生产曾一度进行得很迟缓，许多农业社社员认为“今年大丰收够吃够用了”，对搞冬季生产不起劲，到去年12月间，全县只积肥十五万多担；动工兴修的水利工程不多，冬季作物的田间管理工作也很差，只有35％的作物上了肥。过年后，中共德安县委迅速下调了七十五位干部，除二十一人担任乡支部书记外，其余都直接驻在农业社里，他们根据县委指示，同原有社干部一起分析了冬季生产开展不好的原因后，就发动社员总结1956年的生产，使社员认识到所以能丰收是因为水利工程修理多，积肥积得多等原因。这样很快就克服了社员的松劲思想，掀起了冬季生产高潮。仅最近半月来，据七个乡统计，已动工的小型水利工程有一百多处，全县共积肥八十多万担，60％的冬季作物已施了肥。
    本报讯　据江西日报消息：中共江西省丰城县委1956年12月由县级机关抽调下乡充实乡、社领导力量的二百三十多名干部，绝大多数人安心农村工作，并发扬了与群众“共患难、同甘苦”的传统。他们下乡后和群众同吃、同住、同劳动，亲如家人，鼓舞了农民群众的生产情绪。
    丰城县人民银行干部王笑天缺乏农村工作经验，但是，他到农村后第一天，就到田间向农业社员学习铲田塍与犁田。他的一双手磨起了血泡。在共同劳动中，他和农民建立了深厚友谊，发动农民收藏了几个月尚未收拾好的早稻秆，作好了冬季作物的防冻工作和二百多亩晚田的耕翻任务。
    丰城县文教局局长段淦礼，几年来没有下乡工作。这次他到一向被人认为落后的荷湖区人民乡工作。他在和群众同吃、同住、同劳动的过程中，培养了这个乡的新华第二社的副社长，推动了全社的工作。在访问群众中，他发现有一个十四岁的刘姓孤女现在还是穿着一条单裤，就把情况反映到区，要求设法加以解决。这些事情大大感动了乡村干部和群众，他们表示要更加努力搞好农业生产。现在这个乡内每个农业社的工作都作了具体安排。盲目外出搞副业的人相继回家。落后乡的面貌正在逐渐改变。
    下乡干部不畏艰苦的作风，大大感动和教育了当地有些不愿艰苦深入工作的乡、社干部。尚庄区曲江乡的乡干部和五个农业社的主任，一年来都没有参加生产。他们过去平日大部分时间都坐在乡和社的办公室里，间或到田间去也是指手划脚地检查检查。这个乡的美满社和胜利社主任夏月生、熊何仔两人，从1955年11月到1956年年底，只做了五十个工分。群众讽刺他们是“社官”。当他们看到这次到乡里来工作的干部姜万仔帮助群众挑塘泥的时候，他们感动地说：“上级派来的人都这样和群众打成一片，我们原来在农村工作的人就应该更加艰苦深入。”他们纷纷走出了办公室，不畏寒冷地带领社员挑塘泥。美满社只十天就挑了塘泥四万多担，比前一个半月挑的还多。拖船埠区十三个乡由于绝大部分乡、社干部参加了生产，群众情绪跟着高涨起来，冬季生产迅速展开，在十一天内积塘泥一百一十多万担，修堤土方由每天五千多方增加到近一万方。
