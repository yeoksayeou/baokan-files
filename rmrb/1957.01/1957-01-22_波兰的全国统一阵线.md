    The Polish National Unity Front
    Question: In this Polish parliamentary election, voters cast their ballots based on the National Front candidate list proposed by the Consultative Committee of Polish political parties and social organizations. Which parties and groups constitute the National Unity Front? What are the brief historical backgrounds of these parties? Answer: The National Unity Front is Poland's united front organization. The Polish United Workers' Party is the leading force of the National Unity Front, and together with the United People's Party and the Democratic Party, which are also part of the National Unity Front, they form the core of the National Unity Front.
    The Polish United Workers' Party is the vanguard of the Polish working class, and its predecessor was the Polish Workers' Party.
    The Polish Workers' Party, founded on January 28, 1942, by Polish Communists and other genuinely democratic elements, linked the struggle for national liberation with the struggle for social liberation, mobilized the masses to wage a resolute struggle against the Hitlerite aggressors, and created the people's armed forces, the "People's Guard," and later the People's Army. On July 22, 1944, with the victorious offensive of the Soviet army and the Polish people against the Hitlerite aggressors, the Polish Committee of National Liberation, led by the Polish Workers' Party, was born. After the liberation of Poland, under the leadership of the Polish Workers' Party, the Polish people's government gradually implemented land reform and the nationalization of large and medium-sized industries, banks, etc. On December 15, 1948, the Polish workers' movement was united on the revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism. The Polish Workers' Party and the Polish Socialist Party merged into a unified working-class party, namely the Polish United Workers' Party.
    The extensive program for developing domestic economic and political life, gradually improving the living conditions of the working people in urban and rural areas, and socialist democratization, as defined by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee held in October 1956, has won the support of all the Polish people. The Polish United Workers' Party now has 1.35 million members and probationary members. The First Secretary of the Party is Gomulka, and the Party Central Committee's organ is the "People's Tribune."
    The United People's Party represents the broad strata of Polish peasants. It was formed on November 27, 1949, by the merger of the Peasant Party and the Polish Peasant Party.
    During the German occupation, progressive elements in the Polish peasant movement broke away from the reactionary policies implemented by the right-wing leadership of the pre-war Peasant Party, united around the "People's Will Society," adopted a political line in line with the interests of the working peasants, and combined the peasants' struggle for land and freedom with the working class's struggle for national and social liberation. After the liberation of Poland, the left-wing elements of the Polish peasant movement who participated in the initial people's government organs in Poland—the National People's Council and the Polish Committee of National Liberation—formed the Peasant Party in September 1944. The Peasant Party worked closely with the Polish Workers' Party in the cause of establishing and consolidating the People's Democratic Poland and participated in the land reform and the struggle to restore the national economy.
    Another peasant party that existed in the early days of Poland's liberation, the Polish Peasant Party, was established in August 1945 by the Mikolajczyk group in order to divide the Peasant Party. At that time, it was actually a reactionary party representing the interests of wealthy peasants. However, in January 1947, after the Democratic Bloc won the parliamentary elections, the democratic elements of this party purged Mikolajczyk's agents and other reactionary elements, reformed the party's composition, and embarked on the road of close cooperation and unity with the Peasant Party.
    After the Peasant Party and the Polish Peasant Party merged to form the United People's Party on the basis of recognizing the leading role of the working class, they worked together with the Polish United Workers' Party for the economic and cultural development of the Polish countryside. On December 10, 1956, the United People's Party and the Polish United Workers' Party issued a joint declaration expressing agreement on important political and economic issues, and emphasized strengthening cooperation between the two parties to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.
    The United People's Party has 220,000 members. The Chairman of the Party Central Committee is Ignar, and the Party Central Committee's organ is "Green Banner."
    The Democratic Party unites progressive intellectuals and artisans from certain strata. Its predecessor was the Polish Democratic Club before World War II. In September 1944, a group of intellectuals who participated in the National People's Council and the Committee of National Liberation formed the Democratic Party. On July 9, 1950, the Labor Party, originally composed of some urban artisans and business people, merged into the Democratic Party.
    The Democratic Party actively cooperates with the Polish United Workers' Party in the cause of establishing and consolidating the People's Democratic system. The Chairman of the Central Committee of the Democratic Party is Kulczyński, and the Party Central Committee's organ is "Democratic Weekly."
    Regarding the relationship between the various parties in Poland, the resolution of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee held in July 1956 pointed out: "In the past, with the strengthening of the Party's leading role in the National Front, the alliance between the Party and the United People's Party and the Democratic Party has also gained favorable development." The resolution also stated that each allied party has its own democratic traditions. They can play a broad and independent role. At the same time, they unanimously recognize the leading position of the working class and its party. Democracy, peace, and socialist construction are the common goals of struggle unanimously recognized by all parties.
    The United People's Party and the Democratic Party give full trust and support to the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee.
    In addition to the various parties introduced above, also united under the common program of the National Unity Front are various social organizations, other non-partisan patriots, and progressive representatives of the Catholic Church. Among these social organizations are the trade union organizations with 4.5 million members, various youth groups, the Farmers' Mutual Aid Alliance and the Women's League, each with over 2 million members.

    波兰的全国统一阵线
    问：在这次波兰议会选举中，选民是根据波兰各政党和社会团体协商委员会提出的全国阵线候选人名单进行投票的。全国统一阵线由哪些政党和团体组成？这些政党的简单历史情况怎样？答：全国统一阵线是波兰的统一战线组织。波兰统一工人党是全国统一阵线的领导力量，它同联合在全国统一阵线内的统一农民党和民主党一起，构成了全国统一阵线的核心。
    波兰统一工人党是波兰工人阶级的先锋队，它的前身是波兰工人党。
    1942年1月28日由波兰共产党人和其他真正民主分子成立的波兰工人党，把民族解放斗争和社会解放斗争联系起来，动员群众对希特勒侵略者进行了坚决的斗争，并创立了人民的武装“人民近卫军”以及后来的人民军。1944年7月22日，随着苏联军队和波兰人民对希特勒侵略者的胜利进攻，波兰工人党领导的波兰民族解放委员会诞生了。波兰全国解放以后，在波兰工人党的领导下，波兰人民政权逐步实现了土地改革和大中型工业、银行等的国有化。1948年12月15日，波兰工人运动在马克思列宁主义的革命的原则基础上统一起来了，波兰工人党和波兰社会党合并为一个统一的工人阶级政党，即波兰统一工人党。
    1956年10月举行的波兰统一工人党八中全会所规定的关于发展国内经济政治生活、逐步改善城乡劳动人民生活条件和社会主义民主化的广泛纲领，获得了全体波兰人民的支持。现在波兰统一工人党拥有党员和预备党员一百三十五万人，党的第一书记是哥穆尔卡，党中央机关报是“人民论坛报”。
    波兰统一农民党代表波兰农民的广大阶层，它是农民党和波兰农民党在1949年11月27日合并成立的。
    在德国占领期间，波兰农民运动中的进步分子摆脱了战前农民党右翼领导所实行的反动政策，团结在“人民意志社”的周围，采取了符合劳动农民利益的政治路线，把农民争取土地和自由的斗争同工人阶级争取民族解放和社会解放的斗争结合起来。波兰解放以后，参加波兰最初的人民政权机关——人民代表会议和波兰民族解放委员会的波兰农民运动的左派分子，在1944年9月组成了农民党。农民党在建立和巩固人民民主波兰的事业中同波兰工人党密切合作，参加了土地改革和恢复国民经济的斗争。
    在波兰解放初期存在的另一个农民政党——波兰农民党，是米科拉兹柯集团为了分化农民党而在1945年8月建立的，当时它实际上是个代表富农利益的反动政党。但是，在1947年1月，当民主党派联盟在议会选举中获胜以后，这个党的民主分子清除了米科拉兹柯的代理人及其他反动分子，革新了党的成分，走上了同农民党密切合作和统一的道路。
    农民党和波兰农民党在承认工人阶级领导作用的基础上合并成立统一农民党以后，同波兰统一工人党一起为波兰农村的经济和文化发展而奋斗。1956年12月10日，统一农民党同波兰统一工人党发表共同宣言，就重要的政治和经济问题表示了一致意见，并强调要加强两党合作以巩固工农联盟。
    统一农民党拥有二十二万名党员。党中央委员会主席为伊格纳尔，党中央机关报为“绿旗报”。
    民主党团结了某些阶层的进步知识分子和手工业者。它的前身是第二次世界大战以前的波兰民主俱乐部。1944年9月，参加人民代表会议和民族解放委员会的一批知识分子组成了民主党。1950年7月9日，原来由一些城市手工业者和商业界人士组成的劳动党并入了民主党。
    民主党在建立和巩固人民民主制度的事业中同波兰统一工人党积极合作。民主党中央委员会主席为库尔钦斯基，党中央机关报为“民主周刊”。
    在波兰各党派的关系方面，1956年7月举行的波兰统一工人党七中全会的决议中曾经指出：“在过去，随着党对全国阵线领导作用的加强，党同统一农民党和民主党的联盟也获得了有利的发展。”决议还说，各联盟党派各有其本身的民主传统。它们可以发挥广泛的独立作用。同时，它们一致承认工人阶级及其政党的领导地位。民主、和平和社会主义建设是各党派一致承认的共同斗争目标。
    统一农民党和民主党对波兰统一工人党八中全会的决议给以完全的信任和支持。
    除了前面介绍的各个政党以外，团结在全国统一阵线的共同纲领之下的，还有各社会团体以及其他无党派爱国人士和进步的天主教会代表。在这些社会团体中，有会员人数达四百五十万的各工会组织，各青年团体，盟员人数各在二百万人以上的农民互助联盟和妇女联盟等。　（乃）
