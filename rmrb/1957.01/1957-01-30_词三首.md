Three Poems
Mao Zedong

Nian Nu Jiao

Kunlun bursts forth from the sky, wild Kunlun, having seen all the beauty of the world. Three million jade dragons fly up [Note], stirring the universe with icy cold. In summer the ice melts, rivers overflow, people become fish and turtles. Through the millennia, who has ever judged its merits and demerits? Now I say to Kunlun: Do not be so high, do not be so snowy. How can one obtain a heavenly sword, and cut you into three pieces? One piece for Europe, one piece for America, one piece left for China. A peaceful world, the entire globe sharing warmth and coolness. Note: The ancients said, "After fighting three million jade dragons, broken scales and armor fill the sky," referring to falling snow. Here, I borrow the phrase to refer to the snow-capped mountains. In summer, looking into the distance from Mount Min, the mountains dance, all white. The old people say that when Sun Wukong passed by here, it was all Flaming Mountain. He borrowed the Banana Fan to extinguish the fire, so it turned white.

Lang Tao Sha
Beidaihe

Heavy rain falls on Youyan, white waves surge to the sky, fishing boats outside Qinhuangdao. A vast expanse of water, nothing to be seen, who knows where they are heading? Past events stretch back a thousand years, Wei Wu wields his whip, eastwards facing Jieshi there are remaining verses. The desolate autumn wind is here again, but the world has changed!

Shui Diao Ge Tou
Swimming

Having just drunk the waters of Changsha, then eating Wuchang fish, I cross the ten-thousand-li Yangtze River, with a free and broad view of the Chu sky. Regardless of the wind and waves, better than strolling in a leisurely courtyard, today I have found leisure. Confucius said by the river: Passing away like this! Sails move with the wind, Turtle and Snake Mountains are still, a grand plan arises. A bridge flies across the north and south, the natural barrier becomes a thoroughfare. Furthermore, erect stone walls in the western river, cutting off the clouds and rain of the Wu Mountains, high gorges produce a level lake, the goddess should be well, surprised that the world has changed so greatly.

    词三首
    毛泽东
    念奴娇
    昆　仑横空出世，莽昆仑，阅尽人间春色。飞起玉龙三百万〔注〕，搅得周天寒彻。夏日消溶，江河横溢，人或为鱼鳖。千秋功罪，谁人曾与评说？而今我谓昆仑：不要这高，不要这多雪。安得倚天抽宝剑，把汝裁为三截。一截遗欧，一截赠美，一截留中国。太平世界，环球同此凉热。注：前人所谓“战罢玉龙三百万，败鳞残甲满天飞”，说的是飞雪。这里借用一句，说的是雪山。夏日登岷山远望，群山飞舞，一片皆白。老百姓说，当年孙行者过此，都是火焰山，就是他借了芭蕉扇扇灭了火，所以变白了。浪　淘　沙
    北戴河大雨落幽燕，白浪滔天，秦皇岛外打鱼船。一片汪洋都不见，知向谁边？往事越千年，魏武挥鞭，东临碣石有遗篇。萧瑟秋风今又是，换了人间！
  水　调　歌　头
      游　泳才饮长沙水，又食武昌鱼，万里长江横渡，极目楚天舒。不管风吹浪打，胜似闲庭信步，今日得宽余。子在川上曰：逝者如斯夫！风樯动，龟蛇静，起宏图。一桥飞架南北，天堑变通途。更立西江石壁，截断巫山云雨，高峡出平湖，神女应无恙，当惊世界殊。
