Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 7th January. After shearing, lambing season has arrived on the grasslands of Qinghai Province. Herdsmen are constantly watching the pregnant ewes. After thorough preparations, the herdsmen of the Zhasa area of Qilian County in Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture have successfully delivered the first batch of 1,434 lambs this winter, with a survival rate of 96%.

Since last spring, drought, insect pests, and livestock diseases have been relatively common on the Qinghai grasslands, and livestock in some areas have been short of grass. In order to ensure that pregnant ewes have enough pasture before and after lambing, areas sheltered from the wind and facing the sun were set aside as lambing pastures long before the severe cold arrived. In areas where grass was scarce, some drove the lambs and large livestock such as cattle and horses to graze on the mountainside and alpine pastures, freeing up flat pastures closer to water sources for grazing pregnant ewes.

Many areas have also taken various measures to ensure the health of the ewes and the survival of the lambs. Herdsmen in the Gongma area of Gangcha County in Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture built livestock pens with stones and earth, and sealed the gaps with cow dung mud, digging protective ditches around the pens to prevent wolves. All 104 herding households in the Xia Huancang area of ​​Tianjun County in Haixi Mongol, Tibetan and Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture prepared artificial feeders and lambing bags for warming the lambs. Some areas have also cut and stored large quantities of wild grass and purchased feed such as salt and oil residue to supplement the ewes after lambing and the larger lambs. Some areas have also dug wells to solve the problem of drinking water for people and animals after heavy snow blocked the mountains.

    青海牧民开始接羊羔
    新华社西宁7日电　剪过羊毛以后，青海省草原上又到了接羔的季节，牧人们身不离羊群地注视着孕羊的动静。海北藏族自治州祁连县扎萨地区牧民经过充分准备后，冬季首批接下的一千四百三十四只羊羔，成活率达到96％。
    去年春季以来，青海草原上干旱、虫害和畜病等比较普遍，一部分地区的牲畜缺草。为了使孕羊在产羔前后能吃到足够的牧草，早在严寒来到以前，各地就把避风向阳的地方留作了产羔草场；在缺草地区、有的就把羔羊和牛、马等大牲畜赶到山腰和高山草场去放牧，腾出离水源较近的平坦草场放牧孕羊。
    不少地区更采取各种措施来保证母羊健康和羊羔成活。海北藏族自治州刚察县贡公麻地区牧民用石头和土块垒畜圈，又用牛粪泥住隙缝，在畜圈四周挖了护圈沟防狼。海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州天峻县下环仓区的一百零四户牧民，家家都准备了人工哺乳器和供羊羔取暖用的接羔袋。有的地区还割储了大量野草，购置了食盐、油渣等饲料，准备补饲产后的母羊和较大的羊羔；有的地区还打了水井，以解决大雪封山后人畜饮水的困难。
