    A New Spirit of Thrift Begins to Emerge
    Some Units Request the Return of Goods Bought in a Rush
    High-End Goods Are No Longer Selling So Well in Stores
    (Our dispatch) Since the launch of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, a new spirit of thrift has begun to emerge in Shanghai society. This can be seen from the recent business conditions of Shanghai's two largest department stores—the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Department Store and the jointly state-private owned Wing On Department Store.
    In these two stores, in October and November of 1956, many high-end goods sold well or were out of stock. Some purchasing agents even told salespeople: as long as you have the goods, we will buy them all, no matter the price! Many units, unable to buy goods on the spot, adopted the method of pre-ordering from the stores. The salespeople of these two stores said: recently, they have heard a different voice: "If we can buy less, we will try to buy as little as possible." Many units that had already bought or pre-ordered high-end equipment from the stores have successively requested returns or reduced purchases. For example, a unit in Lanzhou bought six sets of high-end leather sofas from the No. 1 Department Store and now requests a return. Nanyang Institute of Technology had pre-ordered six sets of high-end sofas from Wing On Company and said, "As long as you have sofas, we will buy them all." Recently, Wing On Company called them to pick up the goods, and the other party replied: "We don't need them, we don't want to buy any of them." According to statistics from these two stores, in November 1956, they sold 49 sets of high-end sofas, while in December (up to the 26th), they only sold 10 sets of sofas, and most of them were ordinary sofas.

    新的节约风气开始抬头
    有些单位要求退回抢购了的货物
    商店里高级商品已经不那么畅销了
    本报讯　增产节约运动展开以后，上海社会上新的节约风气开始抬头。这可以从上海两家最大的百货商店——国营上海第一百货商店和公私合营永安百货公司最近的营业状况中看出来。
    在这两家商店里，1956年的10月、11月，许多高级商品畅销或脱销。有的采购员甚至向营业员表示：只要有货，不论价钱都包购下来！许多单位因买不到现货，就采取向商店预定的办法。这两家商店的营业员说：最近听到的是另一种声音：“可以少买我们就尽量少买一些。”好些原来已经向商店现购或预定了高级用具的单位，纷纷要求退货或少购。如兰州有一个单位向第一百货商店购买了六套高级皮沙发，现在要求退货。南洋工学院曾向永安公司预定了六套高级沙发，并且说，“只要有沙发，我们都要买。”最近永安公司去电话要他们来取货，对方的回答是：“我们不需要，都不要买了。”据这两家商店的统计，1956年11月份他们曾售出高级沙发四十九套，而12月（到26日止）只售出沙发十套，而且多数是普通沙发。
