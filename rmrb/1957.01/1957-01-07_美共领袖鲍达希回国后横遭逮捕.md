Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 5th: Eugene Bittelman, a member of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, was arrested on January 4th in Bronxville, New York, by agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation on charges of "illegal entry into the United States."

In 1949, Eugene Bittelman, along with ten other American Communist leaders, was arrested and imprisoned by the U.S. government for five years under the so-called Smith Act. He was released after serving his sentence in December 1954. However, he was arrested again shortly after his release.

Due to persecution by American officials, Eugene Bittelman went to Poland for refuge in March 1955. He was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation upon his return to the United States this time.

Bittelman came to China in July of last year and attended the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China as an observer of the Communist Party of the United States.
