    Building Thousands Upon Thousands of Mansions
    By Li He, Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union	Innumerable Houses Built in Forty Years
    In the Soviet Union, the most striking phenomenon is the continuous construction. Construction scaffolding stands everywhere, and cranes work day and night: building production sites, and also building residential houses. Not only do new streets and new districts appear in cities and villages, but many new cities and new villages are added to the blank spots on the map. Construction, construction, even after encountering war damage, and then re-building after being damaged. Tireless construction, truly forty years as one day. This enthusiasm for construction, this power of construction, reflects the essence of the socialist system, which is to highly develop production and strive to meet the people's needs for life.
    Speaking only of residential construction in Soviet cities, the development in the past forty years has been astonishing. Housing in Soviet cities is built by state enterprises, institutions, and local Soviets, and a portion is also built by residents themselves with their own funds or with the help of state loans. In 1913, the total urban housing area was only 180 million square meters; in 1940, it was 421 million square meters; in 1955, it increased to 640 million square meters (it must be taken into account that 1.2 million houses were destroyed in the Soviet Union during the Great Patriotic War). If, during the first and second Five-Year Plans, the urban housing area increased by an average of 8 million square meters per year, then during the fourth Five-Year Plan it increased by an average of 20 million square meters per year, and during the fifth Five-Year Plan it increased by an average of about 30 million square meters per year. Thirty million square meters per year is roughly equivalent to building a city the size of Moscow every year, because Moscow's housing area in 1940 was only 28 million square meters.
        Housing Still Falls Short of Demand
    Despite this, housing in the Soviet Union today still falls short of demand. Because pre-revolutionary Russia did not leave decent housing for the working people, because of the concentration of population in cities during industrialization, because of the emphasis on developing heavy industry as the first socialist country, because a large number of houses were destroyed in the war, and because the people's living standards are constantly improving, the situation in which housing in the Soviet Union falls short of demand is understandable. Now the Soviet Union's cities have a population of 87 million and 640 million square meters of housing, which means that each person lives in an average of only 7.3 square meters. Naturally, it is relatively crowded, especially in large cities with a relatively concentrated population.
    How to meet the people's growing need for housing? This is one of the important livelihood issues that the Soviet Communist Party, the government, and the people have been working together to solve for many years. But because the demand for housing is so universal, and because housing cannot be built overnight, Soviet comrades believe that the housing problem will take several years to be completely solved.
    Building Housing More, Faster, and More Economically
    In order to further meet the needs of the people, the Soviet Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates that, in five years, state funds alone will be used to build 205 million square meters of housing. No previous Five-Year Plan has put forward such a huge task. The Soviet Union is adopting various fast and economical construction methods to achieve it.
    Industrialized construction methods are being actively promoted. The construction enterprise of the Chelyabinsk Iron and Steel Plant assembled seven houses with a total area of ​​10,000 square meters using large components in 1956, and will assemble 20,000 square meters in 1957. Experience has shown that this construction method saves both manpower and time.
    Standard housing designs are being studied based on the principles of comfort and economy. A nationwide competition for this standard design was held in 1956. Participation in the competition was very enthusiastic, with more than 400 designs for three-, four-, and five-story buildings alone. The Soviet construction industry confirms that in order to build more housing, rooms should be built shorter and smaller. The rooms in houses around the world are generally 2.3 to 2.7 meters high, while those in the Soviet Union are 3 to 3.2 meters high. Many houses in the Soviet Union have rooms that are 20 to 30 square meters wide, which is considered too large.
    Build It Yourself, Live in It Yourself
    The Soviet state is carrying out large-scale housing construction. Soviet workers are also actively participating in solving this task. The workers and staff of the Molotov Automobile Manufacturing Plant in Gorky City built housing with their own efforts. This initiative has recently been responded to by workers in various cities in the Soviet Union and is developing into a widespread movement to build housing using the workers' own efforts.
    The Molotov Automobile Manufacturing Plant builds several thousand square meters of housing every year, which is never enough to distribute. The workers in the body-stamping workshop, with the consent of the factory and district Soviet leaders, took the initiative to build a 24-apartment building for themselves to live in in 1955. The workers in other workshops followed suit. In 1956, the factory's workers built 15 houses with their own efforts, and 456 families moved in.
    Building it themselves and living in it themselves is something the automobile factory workers are proud of. How do they build it themselves? Workers and staff who need housing go to the construction site to work after work and on rest days, and their families also participate. The factory supplies them with building materials. They use the cheapest materials and factory waste, so the cost is more than half lower than usual.
    The actions later became more organized. A committee to assist housing construction was established in the factory. This mass organization is divided into transportation groups, material supply groups, mechanical groups, technical groups, etc. The factory's capital construction section is responsible for the technical guidance of these housing constructions. The factory's Party committee regularly inspects the progress of these housing constructions. The Committee to Assist Housing Construction has formulated a 1957 plan, intending to build 60 houses with a total area of ​​20,000 square meters. Within three or four years, the automobile factory's workers will build nearly 300 houses with their own efforts, which will largely satisfy their own housing needs.
        Workers' Housing Cooperatives
    Various forms of organization have emerged in the wave of building housing faster. The housing cooperative is one of the most meaningful.
    In a machine manufacturing plant in Molotov City, a group of workers and staff formed a workers' housing cooperative based on the principle of participating in housing construction in their spare time every day. The members of the housing cooperative are building houses on several streets in the new village in the south of the city. Some people can move into their new homes in the New Year. It is expected that everyone will celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution in their own newly built homes.
    Sixty people, including ordinary workers, foremen, and production leaders, participated in the housing cooperative, and elected a management committee of nine people. A members' meeting is held once a month to summarize the work of the month and formulate plans for the next month. The members' meeting stipulates that each member and his family must work for 2,000 hours. The members are divided into several production teams, and they purchase and saw wood, build rafters and roofs, and help each other in the construction of houses. The funds come from everyone's usual savings and bank loans. The cooperative has a small construction site, where basic construction tools are placed, so that the members can prepare mud, wood, doors, and windows by themselves. In this way, the workers' housing cooperative has organized the spare-time labor and savings of workers and staff into the housing construction business.
    The power of the people is infinite. The Soviet Union is exerting infinite popular power to help solve the housing construction problem.

    建筑广厦千万间
    本报驻苏联记者  李何	四十年来建筑了无数住宅
    在苏联，最惹人注目的现象是建设的不断进行。建筑架到处林立，起重机昼夜忙碌：建筑着生产场所，也建筑着居住房屋。不但在城市和乡村出现新街和新区，而且在地图的空白点上补充着许多新城市和新乡村。建设，建设，虽然遭遇了战争的破坏，在受了破坏以后再建设。不倦地建设，真是四十年如一日。这种建设的热情，建设的力量，反映了社会主义制度的本质是要高度发展生产和极力满足人民的生活需要。
    单就苏联城市的住宅建筑来说，近四十年来的发展是惊人的。苏联城市里的住宅，是由国家的企业、机关和地方苏维埃建筑的，也有一部分是由居民自己出资或者在国家贷款的帮助下建筑的。在1913年，城市住宅总面积只有一亿八千万平方公尺；在1940年，已有四亿二千一百万平方公尺；在1955年，增加到了六亿四千万平方公尺（要估计到，苏联在卫国战争中曾经被毁一百二十万座房屋）。如果说，在第一、第二个五年计划时期，城市住宅面积每年平均扩增八百万平方公尺；那么，在第四个五年计划时期每年平均扩增二千万平方公尺，在第五个五年计划时期每年平均扩增约三千万平方公尺。每年三千万平方公尺，这约等于每年建筑一座像莫斯科那样大的城市，因为莫斯科在1940年的住宅面积不过二千八百万平方公尺。
        住宅还是供不应求
    尽管这样，苏联今天的住宅还是供不应求的。由于革命前俄国没有给劳动人民留下像样的住宅，由于工业化中人口向城市集中，由于作为第一个社会主义国家而着重发展重工业，由于在战争中大量房屋遭到破坏，由于人民生活水平不断提高，苏联住宅供不应求的情况是可以理解的。现在苏联城市有八千七百万人口和六亿四千万平方公尺住宅，这就是说，每人平均只住七点三平方公尺。自然，住得比较挤，特别是在人口比较集中的大城市。
    怎样满足人民对于住宅的日益增长的需要呢？这是苏联共产党、政府和人民多年来一直共同努力解决的重要生活问题之一。但是对于住宅的要求这样普遍，而住宅又不是一朝一夕可以盖好的，所以苏联同志认为，住宅问题是要经过若干年月才能完全解决的。
    更多更快更省地建筑住宅
    为着进一步满足人民的需要，苏联第六个五年计划规定，在五年中，仅仅用国家资金将建筑住宅二亿零五百万平方公尺。以往哪一个五年计划也没有提出这样巨大的任务。苏联采取种种又快又省的建筑方法来实现它。
    工业化的建筑方法被积极推广着。车里雅宾斯克钢铁厂的建筑企业在1956年用大构件装配了七座共一万平方公尺的住宅，在1957年将装配二万平方公尺。经验证明，这种建筑方法既省人力又省时间。
    根据又舒适又经济的原则研究着住宅的标准设计。在1956年举行了这种标准设计的全苏比赛。参加比赛的很踊跃，仅仅三、四、五层楼的住宅设计就有四百多个。苏联建筑界确认，为了盖更多的住宅，房间应该盖得矮点和小点。世界各国住宅的房间一般高二点三到二点七公尺，而苏联的高三到三点二公尺。苏联有不少住宅的房间宽到二、三十平方公尺，据认为是太大了。
    自己盖，自己住
    苏联国家进行着大规模的住宅建筑。苏联劳动者自己也积极地参加解决这个任务。高尔基城莫洛托夫汽车制造厂工人和职员用自己的力量建筑了住宅，这个创举最近受到苏联各城市劳动者的响应，正在发展成为运用劳动者自己力量建筑住宅的广泛的运动。
    莫洛托夫汽车制造厂每年盖了好几千平方公尺住宅，总是不够分配。压制车身的车间工人们取得了工厂和区苏维埃的领导的同意，自己动手，在1955年盖了一座二十四套间的住宅给自己住。其他车间职工群起仿效。在1956年全厂职工用自己的力量盖了十五座住宅，住进了四百五十六家。
    自己盖自己住，汽车厂职工以此自豪。怎样自己盖呢？需要住房的工人和职员，在下班后和休息日，到盖房子的地点工作，他们的家属也参加。工厂供给他们建筑材料。他们利用最便宜的材料和工厂的废物，所以造价比一般的低一半以上。
    行动后来更有组织了。在工厂里建立了协助住宅建筑的委员会。这个群众组织分为运输组、物资供应组、机械组、技术组等等。工厂的基本建设科负责这些住宅建筑的技术指导。工厂的党委会经常检查这些住宅建筑的进行。协助住宅建筑委员会已经制定1957年计划，打算盖六十座共二万平方公尺的住宅。在三、四年内汽车厂职工将用自己的力量盖起近三百座住宅，将在很大程度上满足自己居住的要求。
        工人住宅合作社
    在更快地建筑住宅的浪潮中出现了各种形式的组织。住宅合作社便是其中很有意味的一种。
    在莫洛托夫城的一个机器制造厂，有一批工人和职员，根据每天业余参加住宅建筑的原则，组成了工人住宅合作社。住宅合作社的社员在城南新村的几条街上盖起房屋。有些人在新年可以搬进新房。预计所有的人将在自己盖的新宅祝贺十月革命四十周年。
    参加住宅合作社的有普通工人、工长、生产领导人员六十人，选举了九个人的管理委员会。每月举行一次社员大会，总结本月工作和制定下月计划。社员大会规定每个社员及其家属要作满两千小时的工。社员分成几个生产队，他们采购和锯开木料，搭架椽梁和屋顶，在构配房屋时互助。资金是各人平常储蓄和银行借贷的。合作社有一个不大的建筑场所，那里放着起码的建筑器具，使得社员们可以自己动手准备泥灰、板木、门窗之类。这样，工人住宅合作社把职工业余的劳动和存款有组织地吸收到住宅建筑事业中去。
    人民力量是无穷的。苏联正在发挥无穷的民力来协助解决住宅建筑问题。
