The Second Measuring Tools and Cutting Tools Factory
    Ding Fan, Li Ce
    In the suburbs of Chengdu, China's second measuring tools and cutting tools factory is under construction. People remember that in 1953, the Soviet government helped China build a measuring tools and cutting tools factory in Harbin. That factory, in terms of surveying, design, and construction, was carried out under the specific guidance of Soviet experts. We accumulated experience in building factories. Therefore, this factory in Chengdu is being built entirely relying on China's own technical strength.
    The factory site was determined in February of last year, and preparatory work such as surveying, drilling, and collecting data began in March. After a short period of just over two months, construction officially started on May 15th of last year. The preparatory work for the factory construction was greatly shortened compared to the past. By the end of last year, after more than half a year, the tool, machine repair, and electrical repair workshops were basically completed and partially put into production. The large-scale measuring tool and cutting tool factory buildings are under intensive construction, and six of the eight dormitory buildings have been completed. The entire project can be completed before the end of this year.
    The design of this factory is a replica of the Harbin Measuring Tools and Cutting Tools Factory, which not only saves design costs but also shortens design time. If it were completely redesigned, it would take at least two years. Now, only a blueprinting machine needs to be purchased, and tens of thousands of blueprints can be re-printed in Harbin. Originally planned to build this factory in 1958, it can now be built ahead of schedule because it copies the design of the Harbin Measuring Tools and Cutting Tools Factory.
    China's designers referred to the Soviet design drawings and made some modifications to the original drawings based on specific circumstances. For example, the factory buildings of the Harbin Measuring Tools and Cutting Tools Factory all have steel roof trusses. Currently, China is relatively short of steel, so the factory buildings in Chengdu, except for the skylights which are made of steel, all use concrete thin-shell roof truss beams. Except for special circumstances, the windows of the factory buildings are generally made of wood. Chengdu's winters are not as cold as Harbin's, so the walls of all the buildings have been thinned. The exterior plastering work, which was designed for aesthetics, has also been eliminated. This greatly reduced the project cost. In terms of improving equipment utilization, China's designers have demonstrated their creativity. According to the new design, with only slight modifications to the process route and the addition of a few pieces of equipment, the production capacity of this factory will be increased by 30% compared to the Harbin Measuring Tools and Cutting Tools Factory. After it is fully put into production, it can manufacture tens of thousands of products annually for China's machinery industry. The precision of the measuring tools it produces is generally equivalent to one one-hundred-and-fortieth of a hair's breadth. The cutting tools include drill bits that are about three and a half hairs thick. Its annual production value is equivalent to 750 million jin of rice.
    When the Harbin Measuring Tools and Cutting Tools Factory was being built, China's machinery manufacturing industry was still quite backward. In recent years, Soviet experts have helped China's machinery manufacturing industry successfully trial-produce various new types of machine tools. Now, 80% of the hundreds of precision machine tools needed by this factory are manufactured by China itself. For example, among the sixty-three machine tools installed in the tool, machine repair, and electrical repair workshops of this factory last year, fifty-six were manufactured by China itself. The performance of these machine tools is excellent. The 1616 lathe, which was successfully designed by the Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Factory in imitation of the Soviet design, can operate at a speed of 1,980 revolutions per minute and can ensure product quality and worker safety.
    It can be predicted that after this factory is built, the time for its trial operation and production adjustment will be greatly shortened. The director of this factory said: "Soviet experts helped the Harbin Measuring Tools and Cutting Tools Factory. Now the Harbin Measuring Tools and Cutting Tools Factory is helping us." Soviet experts compiled a complete set of process regulations for the Harbin Measuring Tools and Cutting Tools Factory, and the engineering and technical personnel and skilled workers were all personally taught by Soviet experts. This time, the Harbin Measuring Tools and Cutting Tools Factory has equipped this factory with a complete set of technical personnel, from the factory director, chief engineer, workshop director, to the foreman, and the process regulations and drawing data are also readily available. These are the most favorable conditions for starting formal production ahead of schedule. In terms of learning new technologies, the drill bit workshop of this factory will adopt the latest Soviet process regulations. According to the director, if the ordered equipment and instruments can be delivered on time, they can build the factory and put it into production within the third quarter of this year.

    第二座量具刃具厂
    丁帆　李策
    在成都市郊，正在建设着我国第二座量具刃具厂。人们记得在1953年，苏联政府帮助我国在哈尔滨建设了一座量具刃具厂。那个厂无论在勘测、设计、施工各方面，都是在苏联专家的具体指导下进行的。我们积累了建厂的经验。因此，成都这个厂完全是依靠我国自己的技术力量建设起来的。
    去年2月间确定了厂址，3月间就开始了测量、钻探、搜集资料等准备工作。经过短短的两个多月，在去年5月15日就正式动工了。建厂的准备工作比过去大大缩短。到去年年底，又经过半年多的光景，工具、机修、电修三个车间基本完工，并且部分投入了生产。规模巨大的量具、刃具厂房正在加紧施工，八幢宿舍修好了六幢。全部工程在今年年底以前就可以完成。
    这个厂的设计是哈尔滨量具刃具厂的翻版，这样不但节省了设计费用，而且缩短了设计时间。如果全部重新设计，至少需要两年。现在，只买了一部晒图机，在哈尔滨把几十万张图纸，重新晒一遍就行了。原来计划在1958年修建这个厂，因为照搬哈尔滨量具刃具厂的设计，就能够提前修建。
    我国设计人员参照苏联的设计图纸，又根据具体情况，把原图纸作了部分修改。如哈尔滨量具刃具厂的厂房，全部是钢屋架，目前我国钢材比较缺乏，成都这个厂的厂房除天窗是钢材做的外，都采取了混凝土薄腹屋架梁。厂房的窗户除特殊情况外，一般都是用木料做的。成都冬季不像哈尔滨那样冷，于是把全部房屋的墙壁改薄了。为了美观而设计的外部粉刷工程，也都删掉了。这样，就大大降低了工程造价。在提高设备利用率方面，我国设计人员发挥了创造才能，按照新的设计，只是略微修改工艺路线，添置少数设备，这个厂的生产能力就比哈尔滨量具刃具厂提高了30％。它全部投入生产以后，每年可以给我国机械工业制造数以万件计算的产品。它生产的量具，一般的精密度相当于一根头发丝的一百四十分之一。刃具中有相当于三根半头发丝那样粗的钻头。它全年生产的价值等于七亿五千万斤大米。
    在建设哈尔滨量具刃具厂的时候，我国的机械制造工业还是相当落后的。最近几年来，苏联专家帮助我国机械制造工业试制成功了各种新式机床。现在，这个厂所需要的几百部精密机床，有80％是由我国自己制造的。例如，这个厂的工具、机修、电机三个车间在去年安装的六十三台机床中，有五十六台是我国自己制造的。这些机床的性能都是优良的。济南第一机床厂仿照苏联设计成功的1616号车床，每分钟运转的速度达到一千九百八十转，并且能够保证产品质量和工人操作的安全。
    可以预料得到：这个厂在建成以后，它的试运转和调整生产的时间会大大缩短。这个工厂的厂长说：“苏联专家帮助了哈尔滨量具刃具厂。现在哈尔滨量具刃具厂在帮助我们。”苏联专家给哈尔滨量具刃具厂编制了全套工艺规程，工程技术人员和技术工人都是苏联专家亲手教出来的。这次哈尔滨量具刃具厂给这个厂配备了从厂长、总工程师、车间主任，直到工长等全套技术力量，而且工艺规程和图纸资料也是现成的。这都是提前正式生产的最优越的条件。在学习新技术方面，这个厂的钻头车间，将要采用苏联最新式的工艺规程。据厂长说，如果订购的设备、仪器能够按时运来，他们就可以在今年第三季度以内把厂建好，并且投入生产。
