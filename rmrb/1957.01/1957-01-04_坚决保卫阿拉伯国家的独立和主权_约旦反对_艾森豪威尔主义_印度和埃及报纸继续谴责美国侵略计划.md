Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd: Amman dispatch: Jordanian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Abdullah Rimawi, commented on January 2nd on the American plan to monopolize the Middle East, the "Eisenhower Doctrine," saying, "We fundamentally oppose the argument about a vacuum in the Middle East and any policy based on this argument."

Rimawi said at a press conference that to defend the Arab world from any dangers that threaten Arab nationalism, it is necessary to rely on the Arab countries themselves. This defense should come from within the region and be directed against attacks on any Arab country, its sovereignty, independence, or interests. He said, "As we struggle to achieve the goal of completely liberating the Arab world from imperialist forces, we refuse to accept the replacement of these forces, directly or indirectly, by any other foreign power."

Rimawi also said that the Jordanian government's policy is to oppose imperialism, oppose participation in foreign conventions, and maintain neutrality. He said, "Resorting to force or taking unilateral measures to prevent attacks that threaten world peace is inconsistent with the principles and purposes of the United Nations."

He pointed out, "Although we need economic assistance, we cannot accept any economic assistance that involves political objectives or carries conditions of foreign influence or interference in our sovereignty."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 3rd: The "Hindustan Times" today expressed disappointment with the new American plan in the Middle East and said, "The victory achieved by collective action in Egypt should have encouraged the hope that there can be greater reliance on collective action rather than the intrigue of filling power vacuums." The newspaper said, "If there really is a power vacuum, then it must be filled by the West Asian countries themselves."

"Free Press" believes that Eisenhower's recent plan for the Middle East is "a tactical means of replacing the decadent and discredited colonialism of Britain and France in the Middle East with a new type of dollar imperialism."

The newspaper said, "Arab nationalism is not for sale." It also demanded that the United States understand that "nationalism has already taken root in Asia and Africa, and any policy that attempts to undermine it is doomed to failure."

Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd: Cairo dispatch: Cairo newspapers on January 2nd successively criticized the new American plan to control the Middle East.

The "People's News" said that the United States should know that "we are determined to defend the freedom and independence and preserve our land for the growing forces of Arab nationalism."

The "News Report" pointed out that the Arab countries will not agree to another foreign power replacing Britain and France.

The newspaper said that all Western countries should know that the Arab countries are determined not to allow their territory to be used as a battlefield for the Cold War or for the struggle for power.

    坚决保卫阿拉伯国家的独立和主权
    约旦反对“艾森豪威尔主义”
    印度和埃及报纸继续谴责美国侵略计划
    据新华社3日讯　安曼消息：约旦外交国务大臣阿卜杜拉·里马维2日在评论美国企图垄断中东的“艾森豪威尔主义”的计划时说：“我们根本反对关于中东有真空的论调和以这种论调为基础的任何一种政策。”
    里马维在记者招待会上说，要保卫阿拉伯世界不受任何威胁阿拉伯民族主义的危险，必须依靠阿拉伯国家自己。这种防卫应当来自这个地区内部，而且是针对对任何阿拉伯国家，它的主权、独立或利益的进攻的。他说：“在我们为达到把阿拉伯世界从帝国主义势力中完全解放出来的目的而艰苦奋斗时，我们拒绝接受用任何其他外国势力直接或间接地来代替这种势力。”
    里马维并且说，约旦政府的政策是反对帝国主义，反对参加外国公约和保持中立。他说：“诉诸武力，或者单独采取措施来防止威胁世界和平的进攻是不符合联合国的原则和宗旨的。”
    他指出：“虽然我们需要经济援助，但是我们不能接受牵涉到政治目的，或者带有外国影响、带有干涉我们主权条件的任何经济援助。”
    据新华社新德里3日电　“印度斯坦时报”今天对美国在中东的新计划表示失望，并且说，“集体行动在埃及取得的胜利本来是应该鼓励人们希望可以更多地依靠集体行动，而不依靠填补力量真空的勾心斗角活动的”。这家报纸说：“如果真是有力量真空的话，那末必须由西亚国家自己来填补这种真空。”
    “自由新闻”认为艾森豪威尔最近对中东的计划是“用新式的美元帝国主义来代替英法在中东的腐朽的和名誉扫地的殖民主义的策略手段”。
    这家报纸说：“阿拉伯民族主义不是出卖的”。它并且要求美国了解到，“民族主义已经在亚洲和非洲扎了根，企图破坏它的任何政策都是注定要失败的”。
    据新华社3日讯　开罗消息：开罗各报纸1月2日纷纷抨击美国企图控制中东的新计划。
    “人民报”说，美国应当知道，“我们决心保卫的自由和独立，把我们的土地保留给日益增长的阿拉伯民族主义力量”。
    “消息报”指出，阿拉伯国家不会同意另一个外国的势力来代替英法。
    这家报纸说，所有西方国家应当知道，阿拉伯国家决心不允许用它们的领土作为冷战的战场或是用来进行争权夺势的斗争。
