Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: TASS, Moscow, January 12th: TASS issued a statement regarding the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine."

The statement said that on January 5th, U.S. President Eisenhower submitted a special message to Congress regarding U.S. policy towards Middle Eastern countries. In this message, filled with anti-Soviet slander, the President requested authorization to use U.S. armed forces in the Middle East at any moment he deemed necessary, and to grant him full power to "assist" the countries in this region militarily and economically. This message violates the principles and purposes of the United Nations, and contains a serious threat to peace and security in the Middle East.

The statement pointed out that recently, tremendous changes have taken place in the Middle East. The people here have launched a heroic struggle for freedom and national independence, and to completely rid themselves of imperialist oppression. This has threatened the interests of the large American and British monopoly capital, which plunders the natural wealth of Middle Eastern countries and obtains huge profits. In his message to Congress, the U.S. President spoke of America's so-called sympathy for Arab countries. But the facts show that the U.S. ruling clique clearly harbors selfish purposes in this region. The main concern of the United States is not to defend the peace and national independence of Arab countries, but to attempt to seize the positions of the British and French forces in the Near East while their influence is weakening. The plan put forward by the U.S. government is a plan for crude interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries, and even military intervention. This plan's aggressive intentions towards Arab countries and its colonialist nature are so obvious that no matter how vaguely the United States declares its love of peace or expresses its concern for Middle Eastern countries, it cannot conceal them.

The statement pointed out that the U.S. President's statement about the U.S. maintaining the sovereignty and independence of Middle Eastern countries is incompatible with the aggressive plan to use armed forces in the region. The suggestion to use U.S. armed forces in the Near East goes even further than the infamous 1950 Anglo-French-American Tripartite Declaration and the 1951 plan to establish the so-called Middle East Command, which had long been resolutely opposed by Arab countries, who rightly regarded it as a real threat to their national independence.

The statement said that the U.S. ruling clique regards the weakening of the British and French colonialists' positions in the Middle East and the achievements of Arab countries in consolidating their independence as a kind of "vacuum," and wants to fill this "vacuum" by means of military and economic intervention in the internal affairs of these countries. However, the consolidation of the national independence of the Arab peoples and the strengthening of their struggle against colonialist oppression will not create any "vacuum," but will restore the national power of the peoples of the Middle East and will be a progressive factor in social development.

The statement said that the United States is trying to portray its policy as an anti-colonialist policy. The proposal of this statement is clearly intended to numb the vigilance of the people of the Middle East. The U.S. plan repeatedly emphasizes that the Middle East should recognize "mutual dependence" with Western countries, that is, with the colonialists, especially in terms of oil, the Suez Canal, etc. This means that the United States is stubbornly trying to force the people of the Middle East to accept the "protection" of the colonialists. In reality, this is the United States establishing the old colonial order in the Middle East under a new guise.

The statement said that the planners of the colonialist plan promised economic "aid" to Middle Eastern countries, attempting to coat their plan with a layer of sugar. However, every sensible person understands that the charitable relief suggested by the United States is only a drop in the bucket compared to the money that American monopoly capital has obtained in the past and present by plundering and exploiting the natural wealth of these countries.

The statement said that in order to conceal its crude interference in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries and the aggressive policy it has adopted towards Middle Eastern countries, the U.S. ruling clique fabricated the absurd claim that Arab countries are threatened by the Soviet Union. This slander cannot deceive anyone. The people of the Middle East have not forgotten that the Soviet Union has always supported the right of all peoples to self-determination, and supported them in striving for and strengthening national independence. They know from their own experience that the Soviet Union consistently pursues a policy of equality and non-interference in internal affairs in its relations with all countries. They are well aware that the Soviet Union actively supports the right of all peoples to control their own natural wealth and to use this wealth according to their own wishes.

The statement said that the U.S. President, in his message, demanded that Arab countries sever all ties with the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp. This demand inadvertently exposes the hidden intentions of some people who want to isolate the young independent countries of the Middle East, so as to easily defeat their resistance to the colonialists and realize the aggressive plan aimed at establishing the world hegemony of American imperialism.

The statement pointed out that the Soviet Union opposes the policy of inciting some countries to be hostile to others. Soviet foreign policy is based on the principles of peaceful coexistence and the establishment of transactional cooperation between countries. Unlike the United States, the Soviet Union does not have and does not want to have any military bases or leased enterprises in the Middle East to extract profits, nor does it want to obtain any privileges in this region, because all of this is incompatible with the principles of Soviet foreign policy. The Soviet Union is deeply concerned about maintaining peace in the Middle East region, which is adjacent to its borders. It sincerely hopes that the national independence of these countries will be consolidated, and that their economies will become increasingly prosperous. It believes that these are the reliable guarantees of peace and security in the region. At the same time, the Soviet Union firmly opposes any manifestation of colonialism. The Soviet Union is willing to assist nations struggling to consolidate their national independence and to eliminate the consequences of colonialist oppression as soon as possible, and expresses its hope to develop comprehensive cooperation with them on the basis of complete equality and mutual benefit.

The statement said that the imperialist colonialist plan proposed by the United States shows that the U.S. ruling clique has not drawn the necessary conclusions from the failure of the aggression against Egypt. The U.S. ruling clique is clearly attempting to restore the bankrupt "position of strength" policy. This will not only fail to promote the easing of tensions in the region, but will instead sharpen the situation and make the threat to peace in the Middle East even more serious. What is heard from Eisenhower's message is not the voice of peace, but the voice of war.

The statement concluded by saying that Soviet authorities believe that the measures formulated by the U.S. government regarding the Middle East region that may involve the use of U.S. armed forces in this region may cause dangerous consequences, and the full responsibility for these consequences should be borne entirely by the U.S. government.

### “艾森豪威尔主义”是在中近东重建殖民秩序的新招牌  塔斯社斥责美国侵略阿拉伯国家的阴谋  苏联始终支持各国反对殖民主义争取民族独立

    “艾森豪威尔主义”是在中近东重建殖民秩序的新招牌
    塔斯社斥责美国侵略阿拉伯国家的阴谋
    苏联始终支持各国反对殖民主义争取民族独立
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科12日讯：塔斯社就所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”发表声明。
    声明说，美国总统艾森豪威尔1月5日向国会提出关于美国对中近东国家的政策的特别咨文。在这个充满反苏谰言的咨文中，总统要求授权他在他认为必要的任何时刻在中近东使用美国武装部队，并且赋予他在军事上和经济上“援助”这一地区各国的全权。这个咨文是违反联合国的原则和宗旨的，它对中近东地区的和平和安全含有严重的威胁。
    声明指出，最近，中近东地区发生了巨大的变化。这里的人民为了争取自由和民族独立，争取完全摆脱帝国主义的压迫而展开了英勇的斗争。这就使掠夺中近东各国天然财富、得到巨额利润的美英大垄断资本的利益遭到威胁。在致国会的咨文中，美国总统讲到美国对阿拉伯国家怀着所谓同情。但是事实表明，美国统治集团在这个地区显然是抱着自私的目的的。美国主要关心的不是保卫阿拉伯国家的和平和民族独立，而是企图趁英法势力在近东削弱的机会，把它们的地位夺取过来。美国政府提出的计划是一个要粗暴干涉阿拉伯国家内政以至军事干涉的计划。这个计划对阿拉伯国家的侵略意图和殖民主义性质是这样明显，以至无论美国怎样含糊其词地声明爱好和平或者是声明对中近东国家表示关怀，也是不能掩饰的。
    声明指出，美国总统关于美国维护中近东国家的主权和独立的声明同规定美国在这个地区使用武装部队的侵略计划是不相容的。关于在近东使用美国武装部队的建议，这比臭名远扬的1950年英、法、美三国宣言和1951年的关于建立所谓中东司令部的计划还要更进一步，而上述宣言和计划早就遭到阿拉伯国家的坚决反对，这些国家正确地认为，这是对它们的民族独立的实际威胁。
    声明说，美国统治集团把英法殖民主义者在中近东阵地的削弱和阿拉伯国家在巩固它们独立方面的成就看作是一种“真空”，想用对这些国家的内政进行军事干涉和经济干涉的办法来填补这个“真空”。但是，阿拉伯各国人民民族独立的巩固、他们反殖民主义压迫的斗争的加强，决不会造成什么“真空”，而是中近东各国人民的民族权力的恢复，是社会发展中的进步因素。
    声明说，美国企图把自己的政策说成是反殖民主义的政策。提出这种说法显然是想麻痹中近东人民的警惕性。美国的计划一再强调指出，中近东应当承认同西方国家、就是同殖民主义者的“相互依赖”，尤其是在石油、苏伊士运河等方面。这就是说，美国顽固地企图强迫中近东各国人民接受殖民主义者的“保护”。实际上，这是美国打着新的招牌在中近东国家建立旧日的殖民秩序。
    声明说，殖民主义计划的策划人答应给中近东国家的经济“援助”，企图以此给他们的计划裹上一层糖衣。但是，每个有见识的人都明白，美国建议的那种慈善救济，同美国垄断资本过去和现在用掠夺和剥削这些国家的自然财富的方法得来的钱财比起来只不过是沧海一粟。
    声明说，美国统治集团为了掩盖自己对中近东国家的内政的粗暴干涉和对中近东国家所采取的侵略政策，捏造出所谓阿拉伯国家受到苏联威胁的无稽之谈。这种诽谤谰言骗不了谁。中近东国家的人民没有忘记，苏联始终支持各国人民自决，支持他们争取和加强民族独立。他们根据亲身的经验知道，苏联在同各国相处当中一贯执行平等和不干涉内政的政策。他们很清楚，苏联积极支持各国人民支配本国的自然财富和根据自己的意愿利用这些财富的权利。
    声明说，美国总统在他的咨文中要求阿拉伯国家断绝同苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家的任何联系。这种要求无意中暴露了一些人的隐秘意图，这些人想孤立中近东年轻的独立国家，而便于击破它们对殖民主义者的反抗，实现旨在建立美国帝国主义世界霸权的侵略计划。
    声明指出，苏联反对挑拨一些国家敌对另一些国家的政策。苏联外交政策是以和平共处和各国建立事务性合作的原则作为基础的。苏联不同于美国，它在中近东没有而且也不想有任何军事基地或者租借企业来榨取利润，它也不想在这个地区获得任何特权，因为这一切是同苏联的外交政策原则不相容的。苏联切身关心的是，紧邻它的边境的中近东地区保持和平。它真诚希望这些国家的民族独立得到巩固，它们的经济日趋繁荣，它认为这些才是这个地区的和平和安全的可靠的保障。同时，苏联坚决反对殖民主义的任何表现。苏联愿意协助为巩固自己的民族独立和尽速消灭殖民主义压迫后果而斗争的民族，表示希望同它们在完全平等和互利的基础上发展全面的合作。
    声明说，美国提出的帝国主义的殖民主义计划表明，美国统治集团并没有从侵略埃及失败这一事实中作出必要的结论。美国统治集团显然企图重新恢复已破产了的“实力地位”政策。这样不仅不能促进这一地区紧张局势的和缓，反而使局势尖锐化，使中近东和平所受到的威胁更加严重。从艾森豪威尔的咨文中听到的，不是和平的声音，而是战争的声音。
    声明最后说，苏联权威人士认为，美国政府对中近东地区所拟定的规定可能在这一地区使用美国武装部队的措施，可能引起危险的后果，而这些后果的全部责任应完全由美国政府担负。
