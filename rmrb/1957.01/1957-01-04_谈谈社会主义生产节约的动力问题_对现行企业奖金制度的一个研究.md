On the Dynamics of Socialist Production Savings
—A Study of the Current Enterprise Bonus System

(I)

Economy means saving consumption. There are two kinds of consumption: one is productive consumption, such as the consumption of labor and materials by factories in the production process, but they are not truly consumed, but transformed into products of another form, so it is called productive consumption. The other type of consumption is consumption-oriented, such as personal consumption in life (individual consumption), as well as the expenditures of state organs and social organizations (public consumption). They do not directly produce anything, but consume the wealth that has already been produced, so it is called consumption-oriented consumption. The consumption we usually refer to refers to the latter.

Since there are two types of consumption, there are also two types of economy, namely productive economy and consumption economy. For socialist construction, both of these are very important: productive economy can create more wealth, and consumption economy can save more wealth. Both can provide more funds for socialist construction. Therefore, in the seven years since the founding of the country, how to vigorously practice economy in these two aspects has become a major issue that the Party, the government, and the people of the whole country often pay attention to. Because thoroughly overcoming waste in all aspects is an extremely arduous task, waste will grow if there is any relaxation, so economy movements have been continuously carried out in the past seven years. It is also for this reason that the resolution of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China once again emphasized that in order to realize socialist industrialization, the people of the whole country must work hard and diligently; military and government agencies must reduce defense expenditures and administrative expenditures; and factories and enterprises must improve product quality and reduce costs. The recent communique of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China specifically pointed out that in view of the implementation of the 1956 plan, a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy must be launched throughout the country in 1957. This is one of the most important national tasks recently.

Based on past experience, it is not easy to obtain real and practical economic results from the economy movement. This requires strong leadership and meticulous organizational work; at the same time, it must have the active actions of the broad masses, and therefore must have lasting momentum, so that the broad masses will not only act consciously, but also implement it for a long time; otherwise, the economy movement will often become a movement of the upper layer or a temporary movement, no matter how vigorous it is, it will often be "flashy without substance" in the end.

Under the socialist system, the momentum for economy is very great, which is one of the advantages of socialism. Because socialism is based on the public ownership of the means of production, people work for their own needs and the public needs of society; state organs are the tools of the working people themselves, and they are used to defend the interests of the people themselves. Therefore, whether it is saving production costs or saving military and government expenses, it is all the people's own business, and it will bring benefits to themselves; therefore, under the socialist system, the people will respond to calls for economy in all aspects with infinite enthusiasm. The reason why China's economy movements in the past seven years have achieved many results is mainly due to the fact that the broad masses have already had this awareness and enthusiasm; we must make more proper use of it in the future, so that it can grow more and become an inexhaustible and inexhaustible source of great economy momentum. In this regard, how to directly combine the enthusiasm of the broad masses for working hard for socialism with their material interests is one of the important links that we should pay special attention to in the future. Lenin once said: To build socialism and lead hundreds of millions of people to communism, "we rely not directly on enthusiasm, but with the help of the enthusiasm engendered by the great revolution, on personal interest, on personal incentive, on business principles." But in the past, we have not combined this well enough, that is, in the process of mobilizing the masses to vigorously practice economy, we have failed to make the masses see and obtain the material benefits they deserve from the fruits of economy in a timely manner (although the state still spends a lot of bonuses in the end). How to improve this from all aspects in the future is an important issue worthy of study. At present, industrial and mining enterprises (including construction and installation enterprises) in China have 60 to 70 billion yuan of production activities every year, and every 1% economy is worth 6 to 7 billion yuan, which is the focus of national economy. In order to promote economy in this area, a rational enterprise bonus system is a very important lever. This article will briefly explore this issue below.

(II)

The economy of industrial and mining enterprises is to save the human and material resources (the so-called living labor and materialized labor) necessary to produce products of a certain specification and quality, and to save the working capital and fixed assets necessary for the entire production. Therefore, the achievements of industrial and mining enterprises in vigorously practicing economy can be reflected in two aspects: one is that the cost of products is reduced, and the profit of the enterprise can be increased accordingly (assuming that the ex-factory price of the product has not changed); the other is that the turnover of fixed assets and working capital is accelerated, and the enterprise can save surplus funds, or engage in larger-scale production with the original funds, thereby providing more enterprise profits. These two aspects are closely inseparable. In order to vigorously practice economy, there must be various systems and regulations. According to our existing relevant regulations, the more the industrial and mining enterprises complete the state plan and realize enterprise profits, the more enterprise bonuses it may extract (a percentage of the profit); this bonus can be used to improve the living conditions of the enterprise's employees (such as building nurseries, bathrooms, canteens, etc.) and to compensate for the piecemeal construction expenditures required to improve the enterprise's production conditions and other uses related to employees. This system and these regulations are to cultivate and consolidate the socialist enterprise's enthusiasm for increasing production and practicing economy from the perspective of material interests, so that the interests of the state and the interests of the enterprise, the interests of the collective and the interests of the individual are well combined. However, this system is generally considered to have the following three main shortcomings:

First, "unequal distribution of happiness and suffering": At present, the product prices of various industrial and mining enterprises in China are not completely determined according to their value. The profits contained in the prices of various products are mutually transferred (some are transferred out, and some are transferred in), and the taxes paid by various enterprises (no matter what form is adopted) are not designed according to the principle that various enterprises maintain roughly the same enterprise profits (the product ex-factory price minus the cost and taxes is the enterprise profit); therefore, the profit levels of various enterprises in China (such as coal mines, steel, machinery, textiles, etc.) are very different due to the above-mentioned state pricing relationship (not due to the efforts of the enterprise), and some can receive a lot of enterprise bonuses according to profits, and some are very few, seriously "unequal distribution of happiness and suffering." In this way, enterprise bonuses cannot play a reasonable stimulating role in economy among various enterprises. To correct this shortcoming, under the premise that the price is fixed, it is generally believed that the main focus should be on the reform of the current tax system: that is, according to reasonable price regulations, for products that contain large profits, the tax rate should be increased, and conversely, the tax rate should be reduced, so that the profit level is roughly balanced.

Second, "maximum limit": Because the profits of many enterprises are too large, extracting enterprise bonuses from planned profits and over-planned profits according to the prescribed percentages is easily restricted by the so-called "maximum limit" (because the existing relevant system also stipulates that the enterprise bonus extraction amount should not exceed 6% or 12% of the enterprise's wage fund at most), therefore, the enterprise bonus system does not have much stimulating effect in many enterprises. To correct this shortcoming, under the premise that the price is fixed, it is generally believed that the main focus should also be on the reform of the current tax system: that is, to expand the proportion of taxes paid by such enterprises to reduce the proportion of enterprise profits, so that the profits of all enterprises are not too large, so that the above-mentioned "maximum limit" (if this regulation is to be retained) becomes a purpose that is not easy to achieve, so that all enterprises can have a "head start" for continuously practicing economy and striving for more bonuses.

Third, "rewarding conservatism": The existing relevant system stipulates that if an enterprise completes the state plan (including the profit plan), it can extract 1%-3.5% (divided into different departments) of enterprise bonuses according to the planned profit; if there is an over-planned profit, it can extract 8%-20% of enterprise bonuses according to the over-planned profit. The difference between these two extraction rates is very large. The original purpose was to stimulate enterprises to strive to overfulfill the plan; but it can only play this stimulating role after the planned tasks have been determined. Now, according to the actual experience of the past few years, this method of progressive bonus extraction for over-planned profits does more harm than good: because before the plan is made, various enterprises (including the bureaus and departments that manage them) will often try to lower the planned targets (including profit targets) to the state, and list as many unfavorable factors and reasons as possible that cannot reduce costs and cannot accelerate capital turnover, and strive to make the plan more conservative, so that it is easy to overfulfill and get more over-planned bonuses after the plan is determined. Therefore, from enterprises to bureaus, to departments and to the state, in the process of preparing the plan every year, it is easy to lead to an abnormal "competition" phenomenon: everyone "competes" for conservatism, not for advancement. Especially because our current planning work is still very weak, and we are not very "clear" about various quotas, the above-mentioned abnormal behavior is easier to be covered up and developed. In order to correct this shortcoming, I think it is better not to adopt the method of progressive bonus extraction for over-planned profits under the condition that the current bonus extraction system and planning system are not significantly changed (for example, not to change to the bonus extraction method that I will talk about below). That is, over-planned profits should also be rewarded according to the general planned profit bonus ratio, because according to this regulation, the bonuses obtained by the enterprise can still increase proportionally with the increase of profits, and it can still stimulate the enterprise to strive to overfulfill the cost reduction plan and profit plan.

(III)

Now, let's further study a newer question: that is, under the socialist system, does the "capital profit rate" (that is, the percentage of the profit amount provided by the enterprise to the total amount of its fixed and working capital) have an effect on urging enterprises to pay attention to economy? Should it become an object of economic accounting and economic planning?

Under the capitalist system, the role of the profit rate (that is, the percentage of profit to total capital) is very great. We know that the only purpose of capitalists investing in production is to pursue profits. Therefore, under the capitalist system, there is a phenomenon that the so-called law of average profit or the law of production price dominates everything: that is, capitalists believe that it is reasonable or cost-effective if the selling price of a commodity, in addition to compensating for the cost, has an above-average profit, and they are willing to invest in production; otherwise, capitalists believe that it is unreasonable or not cost-effective if the selling price of a commodity, in addition to compensating for the cost, cannot provide an above-average profit, and they will not invest in production, and even try to withdraw the invested capital. Therefore, the level of profit rate has become the only sign for capitalists to evaluate whether the price is reasonable and to determine whether to invest.

Under the socialist system, production and prices are planned, and they are governed and regulated by the basic economic laws of socialism and the laws of proportional development of the national economy. They do not depend on which can provide an above-average profit and which cannot provide an above-average profit. Therefore, the capital profit rate of each production department may be high or low, and they will not tend to the average level. Therefore, the capital profit rate indicator becomes a useless indicator for price issues, investment issues, and production arrangements under the socialist system, and people can ignore research and accounting. But this does not mean that under the socialist system, people can not pay attention to the turnover effect of fixed assets and working capital, and can not pay attention to economy and the rational use of funds. In fact, on the contrary, people pay great attention to the rational use and economy of funds. For example, when preparing and executing plans, they pay great attention to advancing the start date of new factories and mines and improving the utilization rate of equipment for fixed assets, and they pay great attention to reducing unreasonable raw material reserves and inventory of finished products for working capital to accelerate the turnover of working capital, etc.; At the same time, there are reflections and accounting in the cost plan, for example, if the equipment utilization rate is low, the depreciation cost in the product cost will increase, and if the working capital occupation is too much, it will increase the cost due to the payment of interest on bank loans. In view of the importance of this issue, I believe that in terms of economic accounting, in order to strengthen supervision of enterprises and promote them to pay more attention to the issue of capital economy, the capital profit rate indicator still needs to be used within a certain range. There are two reasons:

1. When planning, although there is a series of various indicators for accounting various fixed assets and working capital, there is a lack of a concise and comprehensive and powerful indicator, so that the relevant enterprises can compare and promote their respective capital turnover efficiency and economy level from the general point of view; and the capital profit rate indicator can play the above-mentioned comprehensive role.

2. When planning, although the utilization efficiency of fixed assets and working capital can also be seen through the accounting of relevant factors in the cost plan (such as depreciation, interest expenditure, etc.), this is indirect; moreover, the loss caused by "low fixed asset utilization rate" is only reflected very slightly in the depreciation cost of the cost, which is not as comprehensive as the capital profit rate.

In planning work and economic work, within what range and how to use the capital profit rate indicator to serve economic accounting and promote economy is a new topic; the Soviet Union has been established for nearly 40 years, and this issue has only been discussed in recent years. For example, Professor Birman, who once served as an economics consultant at Renmin University of China and the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, once believed that the importance of the capital profit rate of socialist enterprises is very obvious, because issues such as the use effect of fixed assets, which have great national significance, have not been properly reflected in economic and financial indicators (please refer to "Economic Research" No. 3, 1956). For example, the Soviet Union's "Economic Issues" magazine (No. 6, 1955) and "Communist" magazine (No. 10, 1956) have successively published two articles by the writer Liebermann specializing in economic planning, economic accounting, and material rewards for industrial workers, pointing out that the Soviet Union's current financial planning methods and enterprise bonus system still have shortcomings, and advocating the use of classified average profit rates as the basis for extracting enterprise bonuses (please refer to "Economic Translation Series" No. 10, 1955 and No. 12, 1956). I will now describe my preliminary thoughts on "capital profit rate" as follows:

1. Since socialist production is basically planned, and the ex-factory prices of products are basically stipulated by the state, generally they cannot be freely changed and freely rise and fall by various departments and enterprises; at the same time, as mentioned above, when the state stipulates prices, it does not take it as the standard that various products and various production departments can obtain roughly the same average profit. Therefore, we cannot simply and generally believe that: the department that can provide a higher capital profit rate means that the department can save the use of funds, which means that its capital turnover is fast and good, so it should get more bonuses; the department that cannot provide a higher capital profit rate means that the department has waste in the use of funds, which means that its capital turnover is slow and bad, so it should not be given bonuses. If we want to evaluate bonuses based on the capital profit rate within this range, then that is inappropriate.

2. Not only that, but enterprises in the same department (such as cotton textile factories or steel factories) will also have different costs due to different objective conditions (such as one being a new machine and one being an old machine; one being close to the raw material production area and one not being close to the raw material production area, etc.), so the capital profit rate of each enterprise cannot but be high and low. Therefore, within this range, the capital profit rate cannot be used as the basis for bonus extraction.

3. However, if we first divide the enterprises of the same department or similar departments into three or five types according to different objective conditions, and make precise analyses based on existing statistical data to find out the average level of the capital profit rate of each type of enterprise (such as 10%, 15%, 20%...), as a temporary fixed base for the next few years; then stipulate that each enterprise in each type, in each planning year, cannot extract bonuses according to its profit if it does not reach the average profit rate of the type (because this is because it is worse managed than other general enterprises of the same type, such as high cost and slow capital turnover, etc., and has not reached the average profit level that it should have), only those who reach and exceed the average profit rate of the type and complete the annual production plan can extract bonuses according to their profit, which is reasonable and feasible. Extracting bonuses in this way mainly has the following advantages: (1) It has a driving effect on backward enterprises of the same type; it has an encouraging effect on advanced enterprises of the same type. (2) A certain progressive bonus extraction rate can be adopted to strengthen the stimulating effect on economy; because it is based on a relatively fixed base period interest rate within a few years, rather than on the planned profit of the year, so it will not cause the "rewarding conservatism" effect mentioned earlier. (3) Enterprise bonuses are not only closely combined with saving production costs, but also closely combined with saving production funds (especially fixed assets), and it has a further role in promoting economy.

4. In order to save basic construction investment and rationally use investment, we are now relying on correctly arranging basic construction plans, reducing construction costs, completing projects early, and putting them into production early. In this regard, I think it is also possible to consider making the following regulations: that is, for new factories and mines to the completion and commissioning date set by the plan, if there are no special reasons and approved by the state, regardless of whether the completion and commissioning, its investment should be transferred to the fixed assets of the department first - in this way, it can further urge the basic construction department to pay attention to the progress of construction and production preparation work, otherwise, it will transfer a batch of unfinished or inoperable fixed assets, reduce its original capital profit rate, and not get bonuses or reduce bonuses. The above-mentioned regulations, in view of the fact that we currently have a large amount of basic construction investment every year, may be a very meaningful and very necessary regulation.

From the above analysis, the capital profit rate indicator can be used to promote economy within a certain range, and it should become an object of economic accounting. However, how large is its useful range, how to use it, how to account for it, which conditions should it be combined with, and whether there are other side effects, etc., are undoubtedly very complex new issues. Especially since we have no practical experience in this area, the above issues need to be carefully studied. In order to do a better job in China's future production economy work, the above capital profit rate issue is undoubtedly one of the important topics worthy of serious study by economic scientists and practical economic workers. This article only raises this issue for reference.

    谈谈社会主义生产节约的动力问题
    ——对现行企业奖金制度的一个研究
    沙一禾
    （一）
    节约就是节省消费。消费有两种：一为生产性的消费，如工厂在生产过程中消费了人力、物力，但没有将它们真正消费了，而是将它们转变为另一形态的产品，所以称为生产性的消费。另一种消费是消费性的，如个人生活上的消费
  （个人消费），以及国家机关、社会团体的开支（公共消费）它们不直接生产什么，而是将业已生产出来的财富消费掉，所以称为消费性的消费。我们通常所说的消费，是指后一种消费而言。
    消费既有两种，节约也就有两种，即生产节约和消费节约。对社会主义建设来说，这两种节约都是很重要的：生产节约可以多创造财富，消费节约可以多剩出财富，两者同样可以为社会主义建设提供更多的资金。所以开国七年来，如何在这两方面厉行节约，就成为党和政府和全国人民经常注意的重大问题。由于彻底克服各方面的浪费是一个极其艰巨的任务，稍有松懈，浪费就会滋长起来，所以七年来曾不断地开展节约运动。也正因此，中共第八次全国代表大会决议又再一次强调指出，为了实现社会主义工业化，全国人民必须艰苦奋斗，克勤克俭；军政机关必须节减国防费用和行政费用的支出；厂矿企业必须提高产品质量和降低成本。最近中共二中全会公报又具体指出，鉴于1956年计划执行的情况，1957年必须在全国范围内大力开展增产节约运动。这是最近的全国性的重大任务之一。
    根据过去经验，要从节约运动中得到真正的、实际的经济效果，是很不容易的。这必须有坚强的领导和细致的组织工作；同时还必须有广大群众底积极行动，因而必须有持久的动力，使广大群众既会自觉地行动起来，又会长期地贯彻下去；否则，节约运动就往往会流为上层的运动或一时的运动，不论它如何轰轰烈烈，最后在经济上往往是“华而不实”的。
    在社会主义制度下，节约底动力是非常巨大的，这是社会主义的优越性之一。由于社会主义是建立在生产资料公有制的基础之上，人民劳动是为了自己底需要和社会底公共需要；国家机关是劳动人民自己的工具，它是用来保卫人民自身底利益的。因此，不论是节省生产费用也好，或是节省军政费用也好，都是人民自己的事，都会给自己带来好处；所以，在社会主义制度下，人民对于各方面的节约号召，都会以无限的热情来响应。这七年来，我国历次的节约运动之所以获得很多成绩，主要就是依靠广大群众已经有了这种自觉和热情；我们今后必须更加妥善地加以利用，使它更加生长起来，成为取之不尽、用之不竭的巨大的节约动力。在这方面，如何使广大群众为社会主义而努力节约的热情同他们的物质利益直接结合起来，是我们今后应该特别注意的重要环节之一。列宁曾说：要建成社会主义并把千百万人引向共产主义，“不是直接依靠热情，而是借助于伟大革命所产生的热情，依靠个人利益，依靠个人兴趣，依靠经济核算。”可是我们过去在这方面是结合得不够好的，即在动员群众厉行节约的过程中，未能使群众从节约成果中及时地看到和得到应有的物质利益（虽然国家最后仍然支出很多奖金）。今后如何从各方面来加以改进，是很值得研究的重要问题。目前我国工矿企业（包括建筑安装企业）每年有六、七百亿元的生产活动，每节约百分之一，就值六、七亿元，是国家节约的重点。为促进这一方面的节约，合理的企业奖励基金制度是很重要的一个杠杆。本文以下专就这一问题作一简略的探讨。
    （二）
    工矿企业的节约，就是节省生产一定规格、一定质量的产品所必需消耗的人力、物力（所谓活劳动和物化劳动），以及节省整个生产所必需的流动资金和固定资产。因此工矿企业厉行节约的成绩可以从两方面反映出来：一是产品的成本降低、企业利润可以相应增加（假定产品的出厂价格未变）；一是固定资产和流动资金底周转加速，企业可以节省出多余的资金，或者以原有的资金从事更大规模的生产，从而提供更多的企业利润。这两方面是密切不可分的。为了厉行节约，必须有各种制度和规定。按照我们现有有关制度的规定，工矿企业完成国家计划和实现企业利润愈多，它可能提取的企业奖金就愈多（占利润的百分之几）；这种奖金可按规定用来改善企业的职工生活（如修建托儿所、浴室、饭堂等）和弥补为改善企业的生产条件所需的零星建设支出以及其他同职工有关的用途。这种制度和这些规定，就是为了从物质兴趣上来培植和巩固社会主义企业增产节约的积极性，使国家的利益和企业的利益、使集体的利益和个人的利益很好地结合起来。但是这一制度，目前一般认为还有以下三个主要缺点：
    第一，“苦乐不均”：我国目前各类工矿企业的产品价格并不是完全按它们的价值来规定的，各种产品价格中所含的利润是互有转移的（有的转出，有的转进），而各类企业所缴的税金（不论采取何种形式），并不是按各类企业保持相差不多的企业利润（产品出厂价格减去成本和税金即为企业利润）这一原则来设计的；因而我国目前各类企业（如煤矿、钢铁、机器、纺织等企业）之间的利润水平就因上述国家定价的关系（不是由于企业努力与否）而很有悬殊，有的按利润可以提到很多的企业奖金，有的很少，严重地“苦乐不均”。这样，企业奖金就不能在各企业之间对节约起合理的刺激作用。要改正这一缺点，在价格为已定的前提下，一般认为主要应从现行税制的改革着手：即按合理的价格规定，凡其中包含利润较大的产品，应将税率提高一些，相反，应将税率降低一些，使利润水平大体均衡。
    第二，“最高限额”：由于有很多企业底利润过大，按规定百分比从计划利润和超计划利润提取企业奖金，很容易受到所谓“最高限额”的限制（因为现行有关制度又有企业奖金提成额最多不得超过该企业工资基金6％或12％的规定），因此，企业奖金制度在很多企业中就没有多大的刺激作用。要改正这一缺点，在价格为已定的前提下，一般认为主要亦应从现行税制的改革着手：即扩大这类企业所缴的税金的比例，以缩小企业利润的比例，使所有企业底利润都为数不过大，使上述“最高限额”（假使要保留这一规定的话）成为不很容易达到的目的，这样就可以使所有企业为不断节约和争取多得奖金而有一个“奔头”。
    第三，“奖励保守”：现行有关制度规定，企业完成了国家计划（包括利润计划），可按计划利润提取1％—3.5％（分不同部门）的企业奖金；有了超计划利润，可按超计划利润提取8％—20％的企业奖金。这两种提成率是相差很大的，其目的原是想刺激企业努力超额完成计划；但是必须在计划任务已经确定之后，才能起这种刺激作用。现在，按数年来的实际经验看来，这种超额提奖办法是害多利少的：因为在订计划之前，各企业（包括管理它们的管理局和部）对国家往往会因此而更力求压低计划指标（包括利润指标），尽量列举不能降低成本和不能加速资金周转的不利因素和理由，争取计划定得保守一些，使计划确定以后容易超额完成和多得超计划奖金。因此，从企业到管理局，到部和到国家之间，在每年编制计划的过程中，就容易引出一种反常的“竞赛”现象：大家为保守而“竞赛”，而不是为先进而竞赛。特别是由于我们目前计划工作的基础还很薄弱，对各种定额都不很“摸底”，上述不正常的行为就更容易得到掩护和发展。为改正这一缺点，我认为在现行提奖制度和计划制度不作重大改变
  （例如不改行本文下面将要讲到的提奖办法）的条件下，还是不采取超计划利润累进提奖的办法为好。即超计划利润也应该按一般计划利润的提奖比例提奖，因为按这样规定，企业所得奖金还是可以随利润的增多而比例增多，还是能够刺激企业去努力超额完成成本降低计划和利润计划。
    （三）
    现在，再进一步来研究一个较新的问题：即在社会主义制度下，“资金利润率”（即企业所提供的利润额占其全部固定和流动资金额的百分比）对于督促企业注意节约，是否有其作用？它是否应该成为经济核算和经济计划的一个对象？
    在资本主义制度下，利润率（即利润占全部资本的百分比）底作用是十分巨大的，我们知道，资本家投资生产的唯一目的就是追逐利润，因此，在资本主义制度下，就有所谓平均利润法则或生产价格法则左右一切的现象：即凡商品底出售价格除补偿成本外，还有平均以上的利润，资本家就认为是合理的或合算的，就愿意投资生产；否则，凡商品底出售价格除补偿成本外，不能提供平均以上的利润，资本家就认为是不合理的或不合算的，就不去投资生产、以至将已投下的资本设法抽走。所以利润率高低就成为资本家评判价格合理与否和确定投资与否的唯一标志。
    在社会主义制度下，生产和价格是有计划的，它们受社会主义基本经济规律和国民经济按比例的发展规律的规定和调节，它们不以何者能提供平均以上的利润、何者不能提供平均以上的利润为转移。因此，各生产部门底资金利润率有的可以高，有的可以低，它们不会趋向于平均水平。从而资金利润率这一指标，对社会主义制度下的价格问题、投资问题和生产安排等问题来说，就变为无用的指标，人们可以不去研究和核算。但这绝不是说，在社会主义制度下，人们可以不讲究固定资产和流动资金的周转效果，可以不讲究节约和合理使用资金。事实正相反，人们很注意资金的合理使用和节约，例如在编制计划和执行计划时，对固定资产就极注意提早新建厂矿的开工日期和提高设备利用率，对流动资金就极注意减少不合理的原材料储备和已成品的库存，以加速流动资金的周转等等；同时，在成本计划中，亦有它们的反映和核算，例如设备利用率低了，产品成本中的折旧费就要加大，流动资金占用多了，就会因多付银行贷款的利息而加大成本。鉴于这一问题的重要性，我认为，在经济核算方面，为要加强对企业的督促并推动它们更加注意资金节约问题，资金利润率这一指标在一定范围之内，还有利用的必要，理由有二：
    1、在计划时，为要核算各种固定资产和流动资金，虽然有一系列的各种指标，但是缺乏一个简明扼要的综合性的有力指标，使有关各企业之间能从大体上来比较和促进各自底资金周转效率和节约程度；而资金利润率这一指标却能起到上述综合性的作用。
    2、在计划时，虽然通过成本计划的有关因素（如折旧费、利息支出等等）的核算，也会看到固定资产和流动资金的利用效率，但这是间接的；况且由于“固定资产利用率低”而产生的损失，在成本的折旧费上只有很轻微的反映，不如在资金利润率上能够得到全面的反映。
    在计划工作和经济工作中，在什么范围内和如何利用资金利润率这一指标来为经济核算和推动节约服务，是一个新课题；苏联建国近四十年，对这问题也是近年来才有所讨论。例如曾来中国人民大学和中国科学院经济研究所担任经济学顾问的毕尔曼教授，曾认为社会主义企业资金利润率这一问题的重要性是很明显的，因为像固定资产的使用效果这样一个具有巨大的国家意义的问题，在经济指标和财务指标中还没有得到应有的反映（请参阅“经济研究”1956年第3期）。又如苏联“经济问题”杂志（1955年第6期）和“共产党人”杂志（1956年第10期）曾前后刊载了作家里别尔曼底两篇专门研究经济计划、经济核算和工业工作人员物质奖励的文章，指出苏联现行的财务计划方法和企业奖金制度尚有缺点，主张用分类型的平均利润率作为提取企业奖金的依据（请参阅“经济译丛”1955年第10期和1956年第12期）。我现在将自己就“资金利润率”所初步考虑到的一点意见分述如下：
      1、由于社会主义生产基本上是有计划的，产品的出厂价格基本上也是由国家规定的，一般都不能由各部门和各企业自由变动和自由涨跌；同时，如前所述，国家规定价格时，并不以各种产品和各生产部门都能得到大体相同的平均利润为准。因此，我们就不能简单地、笼统地认为：甲部门能提供较高的资金利润率，就是甲部门能节省使用资金，就是它的资金周转得快和周转得好，因而应该多得奖金；乙部门不能提供较高的资金利润率，就是乙部门使用资金有浪费，就是它的资金周转得慢和周转得不好，因而不应给予奖金。如果要在这样的范围内根据资金利润率来评定奖金，那就是不恰当的。
    2、不但如此，就是相同部门的企业（如同为棉纺织厂或同为钢铁厂）也会因为客观条件不同（如一个为新式机器，一个为老式机器；一个接近原料产地，一个不接近原料产地等等）而使成本有高低不同，从而各该企业底资金利润率也就不能不有高有低。因此，在这范围内，资金利润率也不能作为提奖的依据。
    3、但是，如果我们把相同部门或相近部门的各企业，先按不同的客观条件分成三、五个类型，并根据现有的统计资料作精密的分析，求出各该类型企业的资金利润率的平均水平（如10％、15％、20％……），作为今后数年内的暂时不变的基数；然后规定每一类型内的各企业在各个计划年度内，凡达不到该类型的平均利润率者，即不能按其利润提取奖金（因为这是由于它比该同类型的其他一般企业经营得坏，如成本高和资金周转慢等等，尚未达到应有的平均利润水平），只有达到和超过该类型的平均利润率并完成年度生产计划者，才能按其利润提取奖金，那就是合理的和可行的。按这办法提奖，主要有以下优点：（一）对同类型的落后企业有鞭策作用；对同类型的先进企业有鼓励作用。（二）可以采取一定的累进提奖率，加强对节约的刺激作用；因为它是以数年内较固定的基期利率为准，而不是以年度的计划利润为准，所以不会引起前面所说的那种“奖励保守”的作用。（三）企业奖金就不仅同节约生产成本、而且同节约生产资金（特别是固定资产）密切结合起来了，它对于推动节约就有更进一层的作用。
      4、为节省基本建设投资和合理使用投资，我们现在是靠正确安排基本建设计划，降低造价、提早完工和提早投入生产。在这方面，我认为也不妨考虑作以下规定：即新建厂矿到计划所定的完工和投入生产的日期，如无特别原因并经国家批准，不论完工和投入生产与否，其投资都一律先转入该部门的固定资产——这样就更可以督促基本建设部门注意施工进度和生产准备工作，否则，它就将转入一笔未完工或不能运转的固定资产，使它原有的资金利润率降低而得不到奖金或减少奖金。以上所设想的规定，就我们目前每年有大量的基本建设投资这一情况来说，可能是很有意义和十分必要的一种规定。
    从以上几点分析看来，资金利润率这一指标，在一定范围之内，是可以用来推动节约的，它应该成为经济核算的一个对象。但是它的有用范围究竟多大、如何利用、如何核算、应该同哪些条件相结合以及有无其他副作用等等问题，无疑都是很复杂的新问题。特别是我们在这方面还毫无实践经验，以上问题就更有仔细研究的必要。为了把我国今后的生产节约工作做得更好，以上资金利润率问题，无疑地是值得经济科学工作者和实际的经济工作者认真研究的重要课题之一。本文只是提出这个问题，以供参考。
