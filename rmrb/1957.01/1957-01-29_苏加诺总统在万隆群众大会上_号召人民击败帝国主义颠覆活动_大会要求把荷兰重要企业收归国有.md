Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 28th - President Sukarno stated at a mass rally in Bandung attended by 100,000 people on the 27th, that imperialist elements must not be allowed to continue their activities in Indonesia. The Indonesian people must resist their political and economic subversion.

Seven years ago, Dutch officer Westerling led Dutch troops to attack Bandung in an attempt to subvert the Republic of Indonesia. This mass rally was convened to remind everyone of the atrocities of imperialism.

President Sukarno said that the current situation in Indonesia is very bad, and even the integrity of the country may be damaged. He pointed out that this is because imperialism is intensifying its subversive activities against Indonesia. He said that although Westerling is no longer in Indonesia, his incarnations continue to carry out various activities in Indonesia. They often implement this or that plan to undermine the integrity of the Republic of Indonesia. He said that only by relying on revolutionary unity can these subversive activities be truly defeated.

In his speech, President Sukarno also expressed his desire to participate in the work of the government and actively improve the current situation. He said that the current provisional constitution stipulates that the president cannot participate in the work of the government. For the past eleven years since independence, he has only been regarded as a "rubber stamp." This has kept him away from the masses. He hopes that before the new constitution is produced, if the people allow it, there will be a transitional method allowing him to participate in the work of the government without violating the principles of the current constitution. That is why he is prepared to put forward his plan to reform the status quo. However, the President did not mention the content of his plan.

The conference passed a resolution calling on the Indonesian people to unite and completely crush the reactionary elements' conspiracy to split national unity and the imperialist conspiracy of interference. It demanded the nationalization of key Dutch imperialist enterprises and assistance in promoting the implementation of its policies by the current cabinet. The resolution also called for strengthening international anti-colonialist solidarity, especially the solidarity of the Asian and African peoples, on the basis of the "Bandung spirit."

    苏加诺总统在万隆群众大会上
    号召人民击败帝国主义颠覆活动
    大会要求把荷兰重要企业收归国有
    新华社雅加达28日电　苏加诺总统27日在万隆有十万人参加的群众大会上说，不能听任帝国主义分子继续在印度尼西亚进行活动。印度尼西亚人民必须抵抗他们在政治上和经济上的颠覆活动。
    七年以前，荷兰军官韦斯特灵率领荷兰军队进攻万隆，企图颠覆印度尼西亚共和国，这个群众大会是为了让大家记取帝国主义的暴行而召开的。
    苏加诺总统说，印度尼西亚目前的情况很不好，甚至连国家的完整也可能受到损害。他指出，这是由于帝国主义加紧对印度尼西亚进行颠覆活动。他说，虽然韦斯特灵已经不在印度尼西亚，但是还有他的化身在印度尼西亚继续进行形形色色的活动。他们常常执行这种或那种计划来破坏印度尼西亚共和国的完整。他说，只有依靠革命的团结，才能真正击败这些颠覆活动。
    苏加诺总统在讲话中还表示想参加政府的工作以及积极地去改善现状。他说，目前的临时宪法规定了总统不可以参预政府的工作，独立十一年以来，他只被当作“图章”看待。这使得他远离群众。他希望在新宪法产生以前，如果人民允许的话，有一种过渡办法允许他在不违反现行宪法的原则上参加政府的工作。因此他才准备提出他的改革现状的方案。但是总统没有提到他的方案的内容。
    大会通过了一项决议，号召印度尼西亚人民团结一致，彻底粉碎反动分子分裂民族团结的阴谋和帝国主义的干涉阴谋，要求把荷兰帝国主义的重要企业收归国有，协助和推动现内阁执行它的政策。决议还号召在“万隆精神”的基础上加强国际反殖民主义的团结，特别是亚非人民的团结。
