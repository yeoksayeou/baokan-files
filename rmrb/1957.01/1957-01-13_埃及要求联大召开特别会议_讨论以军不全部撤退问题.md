Xinhua News Agency, 12th, New York dispatch: The Egyptian representative attending the United Nations General Assembly requested on the 11th that the Assembly convene a special session to discuss the issue of Israel not fully withdrawing its invading forces from Egyptian territory. This request by Egypt has been submitted to the President of the General Assembly, Thai representative Naradhip.

At the same time, Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi wrote a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 11th, pointing out that Israel had not fully withdrawn its troops from Egypt. Fawzi said, "Unless Israel complies with the Assembly's resolution without delay, this continued defiance of the United Nations and world public opinion, and complete disregard for the rights and sentiments of Egypt and the Egyptian people, will only lead to further deterioration of the situation and extremely serious consequences."

Fawzi requested that his letter be circulated to all UN member states before the special session of the General Assembly is held.

According to UN sources, representatives of the Asian-African group of countries in the United Nations are preparing to propose that the General Assembly set a deadline for Israel's complete withdrawal of its troops. Representatives of this group will hold a meeting next week to discuss the wording of the proposal.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 12th dispatch: The Middle East News Agency reported on the 11th that the United Nations Emergency Force had taken over all Egyptian oil well sites in the Sinai Peninsula and the manganese mining area of Abu Zenima.

This news was provided in a telegram sent here on the 11th by a group of engineers and technicians who previously worked in the Sinai oil fields after returning to their original positions on the 10th.

    埃及要求联大召开特别会议
    讨论以军不全部撤退问题
    新华社12日讯　纽约消息：出席联合国大会的埃及代表11日要求大会召开特别会议，讨论以色列不把它的侵略军队全部撤出埃及领土的问题。埃及这一要求已经提交大会主席、泰国代表那拉底。
    同时，埃及外交部长法齐在11日写信给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，指出以色列没有把军队全部撤出埃及。法齐说，“除非以色列毫不拖延地服从大会的决议，否则以色列这种继续蔑视联合国和世界舆论以及完全不顾埃及和埃及人民的权利和情绪的行动，只会引起局势进一步的恶化和极端严重的后果。”
    法齐要求在大会举行特别会议之前，把他的信散发给联合国所有会员国。
    据联合国人士说，联合国亚非集团国家的代表，准备建议大会为以色列全部撤出它的军队规定一个限期。这个集团的代表下星期将要举行会议来讨论提案的措词。
    新华社开罗12日电　中东通讯社11日报道说，联合国紧急部队已经接管了西奈半岛上所有的埃及油井所在地以及阿布齐尼马的锰矿区。
