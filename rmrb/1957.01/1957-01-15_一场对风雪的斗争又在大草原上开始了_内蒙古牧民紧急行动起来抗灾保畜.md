    A hard struggle to overcome wind and snow disasters has begun again on the Inner Mongolian grasslands.
    Over the past month, temperatures in most pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have dropped to minus 30 to 40 degrees Celsius, with snow accumulating to three inches to one foot on pastures. In areas with deep snow, grazing is difficult. Protecting the safe wintering and spring survival of more than 10 million head of livestock, large and small, in the pastoral areas has become an urgent task for herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region.
    Herdsmen are adopting various methods to combat the snow disaster. Mongolian herdsmen in Chahar League have been deploying new snowplows to break the snow for grazing. These snowplows were recently delivered to the grasslands from the League's Tiemu factory, and each one is as effective as forty people using shovels to break the snow. In Xilin Gol League, herdsmen have also enabled large groups of hungry livestock to graze by using horse herds to clear the way and break the snow, followed by cattle and sheep. The experience of assessing livestock condition, grading, grouping according to grade, and feeding by category to protect livestock, after being promoted in pastoral areas such as Sunite Right Banner and Ongniud Banner, has resulted in sedentary feeding for weak livestock and greatly reduced losses.
    Currently, thousands of cadres from various parts of the autonomous region have successively gone deep into the winter pastures to specifically guide herdsmen of all ethnic groups to strengthen livestock protection work. The thirteen disaster resistance and livestock protection headquarters of Hulunbuir League have already helped herdsmen solve the problem of insufficient grazing pastures for 650,000 head of livestock due to heavy snow and sparse grass.
    Herdsmen engaged in disaster prevention, resistance, and livestock protection work are receiving strong support from local commercial and transportation departments. Grain and feed are continuously being transported to pastoral areas, and feed reserves are gradually being replenished. Banks have issued livestock protection loans to the Alxa and Ejin Banners of Bayannur League, where livestock were in relatively poor condition last year due to drought and low grass, to help herdsmen purchase feed from Gansu Province.

    一场对风雪的斗争又在大草原上开始了
    内蒙古牧民紧急行动起来抗灾保畜
    一场战胜风雪灾害的艰苦斗争，又在内蒙古草原上开始了。
    最近一个月来，内蒙古自治区的大部分牧区气温下降到摄氏零下三四十度，牧场积雪三寸到一尺，雪深的地方放牧困难。保护牧区一千多万头大小牲畜安全越冬度春，已成为当前自治区各族牧民的急迫任务。
    牧民们正采用各种办法来战胜雪灾。察哈尔盟蒙古族牧民纷纷出动用新式破雪器破雪放牧。这种破雪器是最近从本盟的铁木工厂送到草原来的，每台的效能等于四十多个人用铁锹破雪。在锡林郭勒盟，牧民采取马群开路破雪，牛羊跟随放牧的办法，也使大群挨饿的牲畜吃上了草。牲畜评膘分等、按等建群、分类饲养的保畜经验，经过苏尼特右旗、翁牛特旗等牧区推行以后，瘦弱的牲畜得到了定居饲养，损失大大减少了。
    目前，自治区各地上千名干部先后深入到冬季牧场上，具体领导各族牧民加强保畜工作。呼伦贝尔盟的十三个抗灾保畜指挥部已经帮助牧民解决了六十五万头牲畜因雪大草薄而发生放牧草场不足的问题。
    进行着防灾抗灾保畜工作的牧民，得到各地商业、交通等部门的大力支援。粮食、饲料源源运到牧区，饲料后备量逐渐充实起来。去年因天旱草低、牲畜肥壮程度较差的巴彦淖尔盟阿拉善和额济纳两个旗，银行已经发放保畜贷款，帮助牧民从甘肃省购进饲料。（新华社讯）
