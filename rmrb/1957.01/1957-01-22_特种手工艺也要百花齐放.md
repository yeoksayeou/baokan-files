    Special Handicrafts Should Also Flourish
    Luo Ding
    There are many types of arts and crafts in our country. Zhejiang Province alone has eight categories—carving, sculpting, weaving, embroidery, printing and dyeing, paper-cutting, painting, and metal crafts—covering forty industries with 420,000 employees. Products such as Qingtian stone carvings, Dongyang wood carvings, Huangyang wood carvings, Fanhuang bamboo carvings, bamboo weaving, gold silk straw hats, and Ou embroidery are all well-known at home and abroad. However, in recent years, due to overly strict restrictions imposed by ordering departments on product specifications and prices, not only are new varieties scarce, but even traditional varieties are gradually decreasing. Artisans also feel they have no way to think and create independently.
    Handicrafts inherently contain artistic creation. Take Qingtian stone carvings, for example. They are carved from a natural colored stone, mostly based on the material at hand. The size and position of the "frost" (milky-yellow transparent stone flakes) on the stone determine whether it is carved into a mountain with transparent grapes, or plum blossoms with white flowers, or some other pattern. These vary in height, size, and shape, making them richly diverse. However, ordering departments insist on turning this rich diversity into a uniform "specification," such as square ashtrays or flower vases exactly one foot tall. To meet the requirements of ordering departments, artisans grind stones that could have been carved into round ashtrays into square ones, and carve stones that could have been carved into flower vases over a foot tall into one-foot-tall vases. If the stone is not tall enough, they add a wooden base to the vase. Previously, Qingtian stone carvings included sculptures with historical stories and modern hero models as themes, as well as over three hundred varieties such as plum blossom holders, candlesticks, landscapes, and small wine cups shaped like various fruits. Now, most of these are no longer produced. Xiaoshan's famous lace used to have more than a dozen products such as tablecloths, chair back covers, collar bands, dance dresses, and dance hats, but now only three remain, and these are styles that have not changed for over fifty years. Pattern designers certainly want to design more beautiful patterns, but new patterns require more thread, which increases costs and exceeds the "stipulations," so the ordering departments do not agree. Therefore, some artisans lament: We are not creating, but "drawing gourds according to the model."
    Special handicrafts have always been popular with people at home and abroad. Having many varieties is not contradictory to exporting them. Of course, when organizing production, attention should be paid to their artistic and practical value, and efforts should be made to combine the two, but this is not contradictory to the diversity of varieties and patterns. The reason why some ordering departments cling to a few varieties and specifications of handicrafts is mainly because they regard things that were once popular and sold well as things that people will always like. In fact, people's demands are changing every day. Many people regard our exported handicrafts as antiques, and some foreigners say that Xiaoshan lace is "lace from grandmother's era." If the ordering departments do not expand the scope of varieties and patterns, I am afraid that "lace from grandmother's era" will be passed on to her great-grandchildren.
    The production of arts and crafts is different from the production of other industrial products. After collectivization, some leaders blindly organized large cooperatives. Some stone carving production cooperatives even adopted assembly line operations, with some people specializing in cutting, others in drilling holes, some in carving mountains, and others in carving people. Although the intention was good and production efficiency has improved, the resulting artwork featuring landscapes, figures, pavilions, and flowers lacks a consistent artistic style and is not as beautiful as one carved by a single person. Cooperative members also feel that assembly line operations do not improve their skills, and they feel very depressed. Some people do not understand the lives of artisans and treat older artisans with a rough attitude. The late old artisan Jin Jingyi liked to drink some wine and wander around before creating. This habit of his was criticized as "not complying with labor discipline." These things may seem trivial, but if they are not paid attention to, they will also affect the artisans' production mood. As the artisans themselves say: "When we are unhappy, the people we carve all look angry."
    The stone carvings produced in the Qingtian and Fangshan areas of Zhejiang are made of stone, with the old ones being used for carving and the tender ones being excellent industrial raw materials. Recently, with the development of industry, the number of industrial stone materials used has increased. Because the allocation is not well managed, some stone carving production cooperatives cannot buy good stones. It is said that machines will be used for mining this year, and the crushed stones mined cannot be carved. If this is not well arranged, it will bring great difficulties to the artisans.
    Special crafts are a valuable heritage of our motherland, and we must protect and develop them. To this end, we hope to create favorable conditions for the production of special handicrafts and eliminate various man-made obstacles. This is not the responsibility of any one department, but the joint responsibility of all departments related to special handicrafts.

    特种手工艺也要百花齐放
    罗丁
    我国工艺美术品的种类很多，仅浙江省就有雕刻、塑造、编织、刺绣、印染、剪贴、采绘和金属工艺品八类，四十个行业，从业人员四十二万人。产品中如青田石雕、东杨木雕、黄杨木雕、翻簧竹刻、竹编、金丝草帽、瓯绣等等，在国内外都很有名。但是，近几年来，由于订货部门对产品规格和价格的限制太严，不仅新的品种很少，而且连传统的品种也逐渐减少，艺人们也感到没有办法独立思考，独立创作。
    手工艺品本来包含着艺术创作。比如青田石雕，是用一种天然彩石雕成的，大部分都是就料取裁，根据石头上冻（乳黄色透明石片）的大小位置来决定，或刻成山，在山上长着透明的葡萄；或刻成梅，盛开着一朵朵白色花；或刻成别的什么花样。这其中高矮、大小、形状都不一样，堪称丰富多采。但是，订货部门一定要把丰富多采的作品，统一变成一个“规格”，例如烟缸，只要方的；花瓶，一律一尺高。艺人们为了适合订货部门的要求，把本来可以刻成圆烟缸的料磨成方的，把本来可以刻成一尺多高花瓶的石料刻成一尺高的；要是石料不够一尺高，就在花瓶下面加上个木头垫子。以前，青田石雕有以历史故事和现代英雄模范为题材的雕刻，还有梅花筒、灯台、山水、各种水果形状的小酒杯等等三百多种，现在大部分都不生产了。萧山有名的花边，以前有台布、椅背套、领圈、舞衣、舞帽等等十几种产品，现在只剩下三种，而且是五十多年一直没有改变过的式样。图案设计人员何尝不想把花样设计得更美，只是因新花样要多用线，要增加成本，超出“规定”，订货部门不同意。所以，有的艺人们感叹地说：我们不是在创作，而是“照样画葫芦”。
    特种手工艺品，无论过去和现在，一向是受国内外人民喜爱的。品种多和出口并不矛盾。当然，在组织生产的时候，应该注意它们的艺术性和实用性，尽量把两者结合起来，但这跟品种花样的多样性也不是矛盾的。有些订货部门所以死抓住少数品种和规格的手工艺品不放，主要是把比较受人喜欢过、销路比较多的东西，看成人们永远喜欢的东西。其实人们的要求是一天天在变化的，很多人把我们出口的手工艺品当成古董，有些外国人看到萧山的花边就说是“老祖母时代的花样”。如果订货部门再不扩大品种花样的范围，恐怕“老祖母时代的花样”要传给她的曾孙了。
    工艺美术品的生产和其他工业品的生产不同。合作化以后，有些领导人盲目组织大社，有些石刻生产合作社，还采取了流水作业，打排的专门打排，凿孔的专门凿孔；刻山的专门刻山，刻人的专门刻人。用心虽好，生产效率也有所提高，但是做出来的一件具有山水、人物、亭子、花木的艺术品，艺术风格不一致，不如一个人雕的好看。社员们也感到搞流水作业，技艺提不高，心里很苦闷。有些人不了解艺人们的生活，用粗暴的态度对待老艺人。已故老艺人金精一，在创作之前喜欢喝喝酒，出去跑跑，回来再创作。他这种癖好被说成是“不遵守劳动纪律”。这些事情看起来很细小，但如果不去注意，也会影响艺人们的生产情绪。正z 艺人们自己说的：“不高兴的时候，刻出来的人都是生气的。”
    浙江青田和方山一带出产的石雕石，老的作雕刻，嫩的是很好的工业原料。最近随着工业的发展，工业用的石料数量增大，因为分配得不好，有些石刻生产合作社买不到好石头。据说今年要用机器开采，采出来的碎石不能雕刻。如果不很好安排，将会给艺人们带来很大困难。
    特种工艺品是我们祖国宝贵的遗产，我们必须保护它，发扬它。为此，希望能给予特种手工艺品的生产创造有利的条件，消除各种人为的障碍。这不是哪一个部门的责任，这是和特种工艺品有关的各个部门共同的责任。
