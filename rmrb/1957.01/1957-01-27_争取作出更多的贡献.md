    Strive to Make More Contributions
    Feng Lanzhou
    The Chinese Academy of Sciences has decided to award me a bonus for my research on the transmission of filariasis and related issues. I feel very honored and excited.
    The transmission of filariasis is one of many problems in insect-borne diseases. Although this research has solved some problems in the epidemiology of filariasis in our country and provided some theoretical basis for the work of eliminating filariasis, there are still many problems to be studied and solved in this area. This is even more so in the transmission of insects and other diseases. As far as the theoretical problems of insect-borne diseases that urgently need to be solved in preventive medicine in my country's socialist construction are concerned, my research achievements are still insignificant.
    China has a vast territory and is located in the subtropical zone. The natural environment is suitable for insect-borne diseases. These natural factors, coupled with some insect-borne diseases left over from the past unfavorable social environment, make many infectious diseases still endanger the health of the people in vast areas of our country. This is an obstacle to our socialist construction and a problem that must be solved. The characteristics of insect-borne diseases are that the types of diseases and the transmitting vector insects are different under different geographical conditions. This situation is not only different in different countries, but also in different regions within the same country. Taking filariasis caused by Malayan filaria as an example, it is mainly distributed in Southeast Asia in foreign countries, and in the mountainous areas of the South in our country; it is mainly transmitted by Mansonia mosquitoes in foreign countries, but in our country, it has been proven through research that it is mainly transmitted by Anopheles sinensis, which breeds in rice fields in mountainous areas. Different vectors mean that the targets and methods of prevention and elimination are also different. The same is true for filariasis and other insect-borne diseases. This requires us to work hard to study and provide an indispensable theoretical basis for prevention and treatment.
    Parasitology, especially medical entomology, is my professional field. In the past, I have done some research work, but because I could not get support in the old society, I could not go to many rural and remote areas. Some disease transmission problems that needed to be solved could not get the opportunity to be studied and solved. After liberation, I can not only go to any place in the country, but also any research that is beneficial to improving the level of scientific theory or of practical significance to the national economy has been encouraged and supported by the Party and the government, so that the research work that could not be done before can be done. The research work on Anopheles sinensis transmitting Malayan filaria is an example. This work was mainly completed in villages in the remote mountains of western Guangxi.
    The vigorous construction work being carried out throughout the country has made me deeply realize that studying the source of transmission of insect-borne diseases, doing a good job in prevention, and safeguarding people's health are important guarantees for the smooth completion of construction work. In these aspects, the two important documents, the Agricultural Development Program and the Scientific Research Plan, have pointed out clear directions for effort and development. In addition, the Academy of Sciences has also stipulated a scientific research reward system. All this shows the importance that the Party and the government attach to protecting the health of the people and to scientific research work. The Chinese Academy of Sciences' award to me for the research on the transmission of filariasis and other issues has given me great honor and encouragement. At the same time of extreme excitement, I also feel the importance of the responsibility. Therefore, I am determined to work harder in future research work and in the training of talents to strive for further achievements to contribute to the socialist construction of our country and to thank the Party and the government for the honor and care given to me.

    争取作出更多的贡献

    对于我所作的关于丝虫病的传染等问题的研究，中国科学院决定给予奖金。我感到非常荣幸，非常兴奋。
    丝虫病的传染问题，是昆虫传染疾病的许多问题中的一个。这个研究工作，虽然解决了我国丝虫病的流行病学上的某些问题，对消灭丝虫病的工作上提供了一些理论基础，然而，在这方面需要研究和解决的问题还很多。在昆虫和其他疾病的传染问题上更是如此。就我国社会主义建设中预防医学上迫切需要解决的一些昆虫传染疾病的理论问题上来说，我的研究成绩还是微不足道的。
    我国幅员广大，地处亚热带，自然环境条件适合于昆虫传播疾病。这些自然因素，再加上过去的不良社会环境所遗留下来的一些昆虫传染病，使许多传染疾病在我国广大的地区内仍然危害着人民的健康。这是我们社会主义建设中的障碍，是必须解决的问题。昆虫传染疾病的特点，在不同的地理条件下，疾病的种类和传染的媒介昆虫都不相同。这种情况不仅在不同国度里有所不同，就是在同一国度里的不同地区也不一样。拿马来丝虫所引起的丝虫病来说，在国外主要散布在南洋地区，在我国散布在南方山区；在国外主要是曼蚊传染的，而在我国经研究证明，则是主要通过山区稻田里孳生的中华按蚊所传染的。传染媒介不同，防治和消灭的对象和方法也就不同。丝虫病如此，其他昆虫传染病也是如此。这就需要我们努力加以研究，提供防治上的不可缺少的理论基础。
    寄生物学，尤其是医学昆虫学，是我的专业范围。在过去我曾作过一些研究工作，但是由于在旧社会里得不到支持，好些乡村和偏僻的地区就没法去。一些需要解决的疾病传染问题也就得不到研究解决的机会。解放以后，我不但可以去全国任何地方，而且凡是对提高科学理论水平或者与国民经济有实际意义的研究，都得到了党和政府的鼓励和支持，从而使以前作不到的研究工作也就作到了。中华按蚊传染马来丝虫的研究工作就是例子。这个工作主要是在广西西部深山地区的乡村里完成的。
    在全国范围内蓬勃开展着的各项建设工作，使我深深地体会到研究昆虫传染疾病的传染根源，作好预防工作，维护人民健康，对建设事业的顺利完成有着重要的保证作用。在这些方面，农业发展纲要和科学研究规划两个重要文件，已经指出了明确的努力和发展方向。另外，科学院又规定了科学研究奖励制度。这一切，都说明党和政府对保卫人民的健康和对科学研究工作的重视。中国科学院为丝虫病的传染等问题的研究给予我奖励，使我得到莫大的光荣和鼓舞。在极度的兴奋的同时，我也感觉到责任的重大。因此，我立志在今后的研究工作中和培养人材上，要加倍努力争取进一步的成绩来贡献给我国社会主义的建设，来答谢党和政府给予我的荣誉和关怀。
