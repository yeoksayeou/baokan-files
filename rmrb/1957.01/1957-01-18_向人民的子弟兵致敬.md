Xinhua News Agency, January 12th: The "Liberation Army Daily" published an editorial calling on officers of the People's Liberation Army not to buy meat or New Year goods during the Spring Festival, but to leave the meat and New Year goods to the people and the soldiers.

    The "People's Daily" published this news on the front page, together with the editorial "Finalize this Year's Agricultural Plan."

    Reading this short piece of news, savoring the meaning of each sentence, tears slowly welled up in my eyes; a large flag emblazoned with "We are the People's Soldiers" flashed before my eyes.

    This bright red flag, amidst the crowds of tens of thousands, in the middle of Yonghan Road in the newly liberated Guangzhou, advanced slowly from north to south. It led the People's Liberation Army's entry procession; on the flag were several golden characters – We are the People's Soldiers.

    Looking down from the window upstairs, watching the old military uniforms faded by wind and rain, watching the simple and honest faces, watching the joyous crowds filling both sides of the street, I shed tears, and everything before me blurred.

    This was not only because I had been in prison, painfully longing for freedom, but because the truth contained in this beloved name – People's Soldiers – strongly shook my heart; because for the first time in thousands of years, the working people had such a troop, as close as flesh and blood, capable of destroying any enemy, so that they would never again be bullied.

    In one's life, there are always some unforgettable moments. I will always remember that on the first morning after the liberation of Guangzhou, I walked onto the street, and people were smiling as if celebrating a festival; because the iron shackles that had been weighing on their shoulders for half their lives had been removed all at once. The morning sun in October shone on the streets, and it seemed that the sun in Guangzhou had never been so bright. I saw a pair of opened shackles lying on the side of the road, the steel, polished by skin and sleeves, gleaming in the morning sun. I stopped and stared at it for a long time, and I felt that this cruel instrument of torture symbolized freedom more accurately than anything else at this moment; it was an epitome of the spiritual world of the entire Guangzhou, the entire Chinese mainland, and our entire Chinese people.

    At the Haizhu Bridgehead, which was blown up by Kuomintang secret agents, people flocked to the broken bridge. Here, at dusk yesterday, many boat dwellers had been sunk, and many people had died. The houses on both sides of the bridge had collapsed walls and toppled pillars, and it was very dangerous to get close. Two People's Liberation Army soldiers, covered in dust, were maintaining order, preventing people from approaching the dangerous area. However, they would not scold, let alone behave ferociously like the Kuomintang soldiers; they stood there, looking just like two honest farmers. Therefore, naughty children and young people were not afraid of them and squeezed forward, laughing and shouting. They could stop this side but not that side, and fearing that there would be an accident, they finally became anxious. They pretended to be fierce and shouted, but immediately couldn't help laughing themselves first. The masses also laughed, but they didn't push forward anymore. They already knew that these soldiers had marched a hundred miles on foot last night in order to prevent Guangzhou from being further destroyed, but after entering the city, they all slept on the streets, not entering a single civilian house.

    The image of these two soldiers has been deeply imprinted in my memory for the past eight or nine years. Perhaps they now wear glorious stars on their shoulders, and their dusty, faded military uniforms have been replaced with beautiful woolen overcoats. But it is they, it is these revolutionary soldiers who were born and died to save the people, who would rather sleep on the streets than disturb the residents, who today still don't buy meat or New Year goods during the Spring Festival, but leave the meat and New Year goods to the people and the soldiers.

    I heard that currently, within our Liberation Army, there is also a spontaneous movement to reduce salaries. The ancients offered the highest respect to those who "worried about the world's worries before the world, and enjoyed the world's pleasures after the world," but I find it difficult to express the feelings in my heart here. I only have one sentence:

    A salute to the People's Soldiers!

### 向人民的子弟兵致敬

    向人民的子弟兵致敬

    新华社12日讯，“解放军报”发表社论，号召解放军军官们在春节不买肉类，少买年货，把肉类和年货让给人民，让给士兵。
      “人民日报”把这个消息，登在第一版上，和“订好今年的农业计划”的社论放在一起。
    读着这则短短的消息，咀嚼着这每一句话的涵义，热泪慢慢涌上了我的两眼；我眼前闪出一面大大的、写着“我们是人民的子弟兵”的旗帜。
    这面鲜红的旗，在成千成万的人堆里，在刚解放的广州市永汉路当中，从北往南，缓慢地前进。它走在中国人民解放军入城式队伍的最前面；旗上，有几个金黄的大字——我们是人民的子弟兵。
    我从楼上的窗口看下去，看着那被风吹雨打得变成了淡黄色的旧军衣，看着那一张张纯朴的脸，看着那塞满了街道两旁的欢天喜地的群众，我掉下了眼泪，眼前什么都模糊了。
    这不只是因为我曾在铁窗里面，痛苦地渴望过自由，而是因为这个亲爱的名字——人民的子弟兵——所包涵的真理，强烈地震动了我的心；因为几千年来，劳动人民只是头一次，有这样一支亲同骨肉、能摧毁任何仇敌的队伍，从此可以不再受人欺侮。
    在人的一生中，总有一些永生不忘的时刻。我永远记住，在广州解放后的第一个早晨，我走上街头，人们像过节一样，满面欢笑；因为压在肩背上半辈子的铁枷，一下子已被除掉。十月的早晨的阳光，照着街道，似乎广州的太阳从来就没有这么明亮过。我看见一条被打开的脚铐，摔在路边，朝阳照着那被皮肤和袂管磨亮了的钢铁，闪闪发光。我停脚长久地凝视着它，我觉得这残酷的刑具，此时比一切都更准确地象征着自由；这是整个广州、整个中国大陆、我们整个中国人民的精神世界的缩影。
    在被国民党特务炸断了的海珠桥头，人们蜂涌到断桥上去。这里昨日黄昏时曾炸沉了许多艇家，死了许多人，桥两头的屋舍，墙倒柱倾，靠近十分危险。两个满身尘土的中国人民解放军战士在维持秩序，不让人们走近危险处。可是，他们不会叱骂，更不会像国民党的兵士那样逞凶；他们站在那里，就是两个忠厚的庄稼人的样子。因此，顽皮的孩子和青年都不怕他们，笑嚷着直往前挤。他们拦得了这头，拦不了那头，又怕出了危险，最后发急了，他们装着凶样子喝了一声，但立刻忍不住自己就先笑了起来。群众也笑了，可是他们也就不往前挤了。他们都已经知道这些战士昨夜为了广州免被继续破坏，曾跑步行军百里，但入城后又全部睡马路，不入一间民房。
    这两个战士的形像，八、九年来一直深深印在我的记忆里。他们现在也许肩上已戴上了光荣的星星，扑满尘土的褪色军服，也许已换上漂亮的黄呢子大衣了。但就是他们，就是这些为拯救人民而出生入死，宁可睡马路也不打扰居民的革命战士，到今天还在春节不买肉，少买年货，把肉类和年货让给人民，让给士兵。
    我听说，目前在我们解放军里，还自动酝酿着减薪。古人以最高的尊敬，献给那些“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”的人，但我在这里却难以表达心中的感触。我只有一句话：
    向人民的子弟兵致敬！
