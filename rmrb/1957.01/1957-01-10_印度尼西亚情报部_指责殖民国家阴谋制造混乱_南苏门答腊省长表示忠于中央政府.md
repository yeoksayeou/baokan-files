Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 9th -- The Indonesian Intelligence Department stated in a radio broadcast on the evening of the 8th that certain countries are currently trying to instigate domestic disputes in Indonesia in order to damage the country's reputation, because they do not want to see the Indonesian people move towards progress.

The broadcast said that the Tom Schilling case is a definite proof that Dutch subversive activities exist. The Dutch government can no longer deny this activity.

It has been previously reported that Tom Schilling, former press officer of the Dutch Army, was arrested in The Hague for misappropriating funds used to finance subversive activities in Indonesia.

The Intelligence Department's broadcast appealed to the entire Indonesian nation to maintain unity in the face of Dutch attempts to create chaos in Indonesia.

Xinhua News Agency -- "Independent Daily" reported that after listening to the explanation from the Governor of South Sumatra, Danu Amurdjo, the Indonesian government has decided to postpone his replacement.

This governor, who belongs to the Nationalist Party, explained to the government that his measure of freezing the finances of South Sumatra was not directed against the central government, but to raise funds to meet the needs of the local army, police, and people, in order to avoid a coup like those in Central and North Sumatra.

    指责殖民国家阴谋制造混乱
    南苏门答腊省长表示忠于中央政府
    新华社雅加达9日电　印度尼西亚情报部8日晚在电台广播中指出，某些国家目前正在设法煽动印度尼西亚的国内纠纷，以便损害这个国家的声誉，因为他们不希望看到印度尼西亚人民走向进步。
    广播说，汤·席林案件是一个确定了的证据，它证明荷兰的颠覆活动是存在的。荷兰政府再也不能否认这种活动了。
    前已报道，前荷兰陆军新闻发布官汤·席林由于挪用了一笔用来资助印度尼西亚的颠覆活动的款项而在海牙被逮捕。
    情报部的广播向印度尼西亚全国呼吁，在面临荷兰企图在印度尼西亚制造混乱的情况下要保持团结。
    据新华社讯　“独立报”报道，印度尼西亚政府在听取了南苏门答腊省长达努阿莫佐的说明之后，已经决定暂缓调换他的职务。
    这个属于国民党的省长向政府解释他采取冻结南苏门答腊财政的措施并不是针对中央政府的，而是为了筹款应付当地军队、警察和人民的需要，以避免在那里发生像苏门答腊中部和北部那样的政变。
