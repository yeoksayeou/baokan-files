    Rao Yang Suffered a Severe Disaster But Does Not Show Signs of Famine Because:
    Ideological Work Generated Tremendous Power
    Zhang Hua
    Rao Yang County is a severely afflicted county in Hebei Province. More than 500,000 mu of crops throughout the county were completely flooded, and only 10% was harvested last autumn. Among 191 villages, 171 villages hardly saw a single grain of autumn harvest. Half of the villages in the county were flooded, three-quarters of the villages had houses collapse, and more than 7,000 households, totaling over 24,000 people, had their houses completely destroyed. Among 180,000 disaster victims, 140,000 people lacked food for the autumn and winter. However, in the cold winter, no one fled the famine to beg, no one sold their sons and daughters, and no one in the county froze or starved to death; there were no signs of famine.
    What is the reason for this? Is it because the relief funds issued by the state were particularly generous? In fact, the average per capita amount in the county was less than four yuan. What exactly supported the disaster victims in Rao Yang? Nothing else, mainly the Party conducted vivid and specific ideological education for the disaster victims and helped them find various ways to survive the famine, boosting the disaster victims' confidence in overcoming the difficulties and inspiring the fighting courage of the masses.
    There is a story circulating near the county seat: Li Tongkun and Wang Zhenchuan, young men from Wang Tongyue Village, seeing the crops flooded and houses destroyed, left the village in tears, thinking of seeking a living in the city; after persuasion and enlightenment by the Communist Party member Wei Jinliang, they went out of the village and then turned back. Such things are not isolated in Rao Yang County. After the disaster, 40% of the cadres and Party members in various villages were working passively, 10% of the cadres and Party members were frightened by the disaster and did not work, and most of the commune members, especially those with labor and skills, advocated going their own way, while the lonely, widowed, old, and weak were suffering terribly. The Communist Party of Rao Yang County analyzed the overall disaster situation and believed that the state's relief efforts were limited, while the power of production for self-relief was boundless. Only by mobilizing the masses to engage in production could they overcome the famine.
    The Rao Yang County Committee did not use empty slogans to call on the masses. They transferred 200 county and district cadres to form condolence groups, led by the county party secretary, county head, and other key cadres, carrying reed mats, grain, coal, and daily necessities, to go to the disaster-stricken villages to help the disaster victims repair mills, build stoves, and set up shacks, using facts to encourage the disaster victims' mood for overcoming the famine. They also separately convened condolence meetings for Party members, commune members, youths, women, and the lonely and widowed households, reading out condolence letters from county-level departments to the masses, explaining the favorable conditions for overcoming the famine; and distributing the 4,000 jin of emergency relief grain airdropped by the central government in the county seat to dozens of severely affected villages. The masses saw the fried rice sent by plane, ate the oil, salt, and grain transported by boat, and lived in shacks set up with mats issued by the government, and no longer said "there is no way to survive the famine."
    The Communist Party of Rao Yang County understood that strong ideological education work was essential in the face of such a severe disaster. The Propaganda Department of the County Committee issued instructions to strengthen political and ideological work in the disaster area, compiled supplementary teaching materials for Party classes, and the County Committee and resident work teams also convened report meetings in districts and villages to educate Party members and League members on "sharing weal and woe with the masses"; and based on their performance in rescue and resettlement work, they led the county's rural Party members in carrying out evaluations and appraisals, mobilizing Party members and the masses to educate themselves. Niu Junyi from Shao Village donated his wooden door panels to block the dike, and after the flood entered the village, he bravely rescued three lonely old households, and was praised at the Party member congress at the district level; Wang Jindong from Jin Zhangbao Village shrank back and ran away while protecting the dike, and was criticized at the meeting. One hundred and forty-five branches evaluated and selected more than 400 model Party members who sacrificed themselves to protect the interests of the masses during the disaster; and a small number of Party members who performed poorly were criticized and educated. After the evaluation, the confidence of the Party in overcoming difficulties and defeating the disaster was strengthened. Party cadres such as Niu Ren from Niu Village automatically took out boats, donated their skills, and led the commune members to fish and weave baskets. More than 90% of the branches in the county actively led the disaster victims to plant wheat and develop sideline occupations. When distributing relief funds and winter clothing, in order to prevent bias on the part of grassroots cadres, the Communist Party of Rao Yang County also organized more than 70 reporters to conduct a discipline education for rural Party members.
    Production for overcoming the famine was set in motion, but new problems arose. Commune members with strong labor, high skills, and tools in Songgezhuang Village pushed carts and carried things, and the commune cadres stood guard at the street corners, restricting the individual sideline activities of the commune members. Conflicts arose between individuals and the collective. What to do? The County Committee instructed each village to explain the working methods of rural branches to Party members during Party classes; and combined with the transmission of the "Eighth National Congress" documents, with the mass line as the focus, they conducted five or six evenings of general training within the Party, criticizing the error of neglecting the individual interests of commune members and restricting commune members from engaging in individual sideline activities by standing guard and blocking roads; and used the typical material of the Red Light Cooperative helping commune members engage in small-scale sideline occupations from funds and time and strengthening commune members' collective concept to educate commune cadres. In the agricultural cooperatives, discussions were also held on collective and individual sideline production plans, and sideline production plans that took both public and private interests into account were formulated. In addition to the 50-odd large and medium-sized sideline occupations collectively operated by the cooperatives and teams, the commune members also operated more than 20 kinds of small-scale sideline occupations.
    Sideline production was launched. However, many cadres and commune members thought that the state would take care of the disaster areas, so they did not save sideline raw materials and did not pay attention to product quality. The homemade cloth, bags, vermicelli, and firecrackers produced by many cooperatives did not meet specifications, and many cooperatives' products had high costs, low profits, and were difficult to sell. The Communist Party of Rao Yang County promptly summarized the typical experiences of seven cooperatives, including Duanyang and Xinggang, in strengthening ideological education for commune members to improve product quality; and convened technical exchange meetings to promote them throughout the county. The County Committee also reorganized the propaganda teams, making timely commendations and criticisms, and organized competitions. The idea of pushing all good and bad products to the state was gradually overcome. According to statistics from the county purchasing department, special-grade homemade cloth accounted for only 0.6% before the meeting, but increased to 12.5% after the exchange of experiences. With the improvement of quality and the increase of profits, the county's production self-rescue movement quickly moved to a high tide. Under the conditions of a shortage of draught animals and farm tools, the county's farmers planted an average of ten mu of winter wheat per household and deep-plowed the arable autumn fallow land. The problem of food and winter clothing for disaster victims in winter has been completely solved with sideline income plus relief. Agricultural cooperatives with good sideline development and commune members with more labor have also accumulated some funds for spring plowing and production and one or two months of grain, and built many houses. The result of timely ideological education work is that the vast majority of cooperatives in the county can unite and actively engage in production. Many agricultural cooperatives with unsound accounting systems and distribution systems have also been improved in the course of production for self-rescue.

### 饶阳受了重灾却不显灾荒景象，原因是：思想工作产生了巨大的力量

    饶阳受了重灾却不显灾荒景象，原因是：
    思想工作产生了巨大的力量
    张华
    饶阳县是河北省的重灾县。全县五十多万亩庄稼全部被淹，去年秋季只有一成。一百九十一个村庄当中，一百七十一个村庄几乎未见一粒秋粮。全县半数的村庄进水，四分之三的村庄倒房，七千多户、两万四千多人房屋倒光。十八万灾民当中，十四万人口秋冬缺粮。但是，在寒冷的冬天，没人逃荒讨饭，没人卖儿卖女，全县没有冻饿死一个人，不显灾荒景象。
    这是什么原故？是国家发放的赈济款特别多么？其实全县平均每人还不到四元钱。到底是什么东西支援了饶阳的灾民？没别的，主要是党向灾民进行了生动具体的思想教育，并帮助他们找出了多种度荒办法，振奋了灾民的度荒信心，鼓起了群众的斗争勇气。
    围城附近流传着这样一个故事：王同岳村的小伙子李同昆和王振川，见大水淹了庄稼、冲毁房子，含着眼泪往村外走，想到城市去谋生活；经过共产党员魏进良的劝说开导，他们走出村去又折回来了。像这样的事情，在饶阳县并不是个别的。灾后各村曾有40％的干部党员工作消极，10％的干部党员被灾荒吓倒不工作，多数社员特别是有劳力有技术的人，主张各自奔前程，孤寡老弱则疼生欲死。中共饶阳县委分析了全县灾情，认为国家救济力量有限，生产自救力量无穷，只有发动群众动手生产，才能度过灾荒。
    饶阳县委并没有用空洞的口号去号召群众。他们抽调了二百个县区干部，组成慰问组，由县委书记、县长等主要干部带领，携带苇席、粮食、煤炭和日用品，分赴受灾乡村，帮助灾民修碾磨、垒锅灶、搭窝棚，用事实来鼓舞灾民的度荒情绪。他们还分别召集党员、社员、青年、妇女、孤寡户等慰问会，向群众宣读县级各部门的慰问信，讲解度荒的有利条件；并把中央派飞机在县城空投的四千斤救急粮，分发给几十个重灾村。群众看到了飞机送来的炒米，吃到了用船运来的油盐粮食，住上了政府发席搭起的窝棚，不再说“没法度荒”了。
    中共饶阳县委懂得在这样严重的灾荒面前必须有坚强的思想教育工作。县委宣传部发出加强灾区政治思想工作指示，编写了党课补充教材，县委、驻村工作组也以区、村为单位召集报告会，向党团员进行“与群众同甘共苦”的教育；并根据抢救安置工作中的表现，领导全县农村党员进行评比鉴定，发动党员群众自己教育自己。邵村牛俊义献出自己的木头门扇挡堤，洪水进村后奋身抢救三户孤老户，在以区为单位的党员大会上受到了表扬；靳张保村王金洞在护堤的时候畏缩逃跑，在会上受到了批评。一百四十五个支部评比出四百多名在灾难时候舍己为人维护群众利益的模范党员；少数表现不好的党员受到了批评教育。评比以后，党内克服困难战胜灾荒的信心加强了。牛村的党员干部牛忍等自动拿出船只，献出手艺，领导社员捕鱼、编笊篱。全县90％以上的支部，积极领导灾民种麦，开展副业。发放赈济款、寒衣的时候，为防止基层干部偏私，中共饶阳县委又组织七十多名报告员，向农村党员进行了一次纪律教育。
    生产度荒活动起来了，但又发生了新问题。宋各庄村劳力壮、技术高，有工具的社员推小车、驮运东西，社干部就在街口站岗，限制社员个人的副业活动。个人与集体发生了矛盾。怎么办呢？县委就布置各村在上党课的时候，向党员讲解农村支部的工作方法；又结合“八大”文件的传达，以群众路线为重点，在党内进行了五、六个晚上的普训，批判了忽视社员个人利益，站岗卡路限制社员个人从事副业活动的错误；又以红光社从资金、时间上帮助社员个人搞小型副业、加强了社员集体观念的典型材料，教育了社干部。在农业社里，也进行了集体与个人副业规划的讨论，订出了公私兼顾的副业生产规划，全县除社、队集体经营的五十多种大、中型副业外，社员又经营起二十多种小型副业。
    副业生产开展起来了。可是，许多干部社员以为国家会照顾灾区，因而不节省副业原料，不注意产品质量。许多社生产的土布、口袋、粉条、纸炮不合规格，许多社的产品成本贵，利润不多，推销困难。中共饶阳县委及时总结了端午、邢岗等七个社对社员加强思想教育提高了产品质量的典型经验；并召开技术交流会，在全县普遍推广。县委又整顿了宣传队伍，及时表扬、批评，组织竞赛。把好坏产品都推给国家的思想逐渐克服了。据县收购部门统计，会前特等土布只占0.6％，交流经验以后便增到12.5％。质量提高，利润增大，全县的生产自救运动迅速推向高潮。在耕畜农具缺乏的条件下，全县平均每户农民种上了十亩冬小麦，并秋耕了能耕的秋白地。副业收入加上赈济，灾民冬天的口粮和寒衣问题已经全部解决。副业开展好的农业社和劳力多的社员，还积存下了一部春耕生产资金和一两个月的粮食，修起了许多房屋。及时进行了思想教育工作的结果，使全县绝大多数合作社都能团结一致积极进行生产。许多会计制度分配制度不健全的农业社，在生产自救当中也健全起来了。
