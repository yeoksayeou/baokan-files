Xinhua News Agency, New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee discussed the issue of the status of people of Indian descent in the Union of South Africa from January 7th to 9th.

In a memorandum submitted by the Indian government for the discussion of this issue, it was pointed out that in the past year, "the status of people of Indian descent in the Union of South Africa has further deteriorated. Many people have been forced to move, and they are not allowed to live in the important industrial and commercial areas of the Union of South Africa."

Indian representative Menon stated at the committee meeting on the 7th that in order to implement the policy of racial segregation, the government of the Union of South Africa forced entire villages of Indians to move from their settled residences. The total number of people forced to migrate in this way exceeded 22,000. These people were forced to endure significant material losses during the migration and lived a semi-starved life.

Menon also drew the attention of the United Nations General Assembly to the fact that the government of the Union of South Africa attempted to deceive world public opinion by using laws prohibiting communist activities as an excuse to arrest many people of Indian descent. He said that in reality, the entire "crime" of these people was simply opposing racial discrimination and racial segregation policies.

Menon said that the South African Union's policy of discrimination against Indians and other non-whites posed a problem to the whole world. He demanded that the United Nations General Assembly make more significant efforts than those already made in the past to solve this problem.

The United Nations General Assembly Special Political Committee concluded its discussion on the issue of the status of Indians in the Union of South Africa on the 9th. The meeting adopted the proposal put forward by Yugoslavia, Argentina, Chile, El Salvador, and Mexico with a vote of 49 to zero with 11 abstentions. Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, France, Italy, and the Netherlands abstained.

The five-nation proposal expressed regret over the refusal of the Union of South Africa to discuss the status of Indians in the Union of South Africa with India and Pakistan. It requested the parties concerned to negotiate in order to promote the resolution of this issue, especially requesting the Union of South Africa to cooperate in this regard. The five-nation proposal also requested the parties concerned to submit reports to the United Nations General Assembly jointly or separately when appropriate.

During the debates on the 8th and 9th, representatives from the Soviet Union, Egypt, Sudan, and Mexico all spoke out to condemn the Union of South Africa's policy of discriminating against people of Indian descent.

The United Nations General Assembly at its previous session had adopted a resolution on the status of Indians in the Union of South Africa, suggesting that the parties concerned conduct direct negotiations to seek a solution. However, the government of the Union of South Africa refused to accept this resolution and unreasonably boycotted it by withdrawing from the meeting. After the current session of the General Assembly included the issue of the status of Indians in the Union of South Africa on its agenda, the government of the Union of South Africa adopted the same attitude and unreasonably recalled its delegation attending the General Assembly.

    联大特别政委会通过提案
    要求解决南非种族歧视问题
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会特别政治委员会7日到9日讨论了南非联邦的印度血统的人的地位问题。
    印度政府在为讨论这问题而提出的说明书里指出，过去一年中，“南非联邦的印度血统的人的地位更加恶化了。很多人被迫搬家，不许他们住在南非联邦的重要工商业地区。”
    印度代表梅农在委员会7日会议上发言说，南非联邦政府为了实行种族隔离政策，强迫成批印度人的村落从他们定居的住所迁走。被迫这样迁移的人总计在两万两千人以上。这些人在迁移中被迫承受重大的财产物质损失，过着半饿不饱的生活。
    梅农还提请联合国大会注意，南非联邦政府企图欺骗世界舆论，以禁止共产党活动的法律作借口，逮捕了许多印度血统的人。他说，实际上这些人的全部“罪行”只是反对种族歧视和种族隔离政策。
    梅农说，南非联邦对印度人和其他非白种人的歧视政策向全世界提出了一个问题，他要求联合国大会应当作出某些比过去已经作出的更大的努力以求解决这个问题。
    联合国大会特别政治委员会9日结束了关于南非联邦印度人地位问题的讨论。会议以四十九票对零票和十一票弃权的表决结果，通过了南斯拉夫、阿根廷、智利、萨尔瓦多和墨西哥等国家提出的提案。弃权的有澳大利亚、英国、加拿大、新西兰、法国、意大利和荷兰等国家。
    五国提案对南非联邦拒绝同印度和巴基斯坦讨论南非联邦的印度人的地位问题表示遗憾。它要求有关方面进行谈判以促进这个问题的解决，特别是要求南非联邦在这方面实行合作。五国提案还要求有关方面在适当的时候共同或者分别地向联合国大会提出报告。
    在8、9两日的辩论中，苏联、埃及、苏丹和墨西哥等国家的代表都发言谴责南非联邦歧视印度血统人的政策。
    联合国大会上届会议曾经就南非联邦印度血统人的地位问题通过一项决议，建议有关方面进行直接谈判谋求解决。但是南非联邦政府拒绝接受这个决议，并且以退出会议来实行无理抵制。在本届大会把南非联邦印度人地位问题列入议程以后，南非联邦政府又采取了同样的态度，无理地召回了它出席大会的代表团。
