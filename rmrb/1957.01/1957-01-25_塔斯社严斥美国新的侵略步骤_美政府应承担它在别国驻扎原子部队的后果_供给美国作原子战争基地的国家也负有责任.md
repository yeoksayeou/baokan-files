Xinhua News Agency, January 24th -- According to TASS, Moscow, January 23rd: TASS issued the following statement regarding the issue of the United States establishing and stationing atomic forces on the territory of other countries:

According to American newspapers, U.S. officials are now studying the question of establishing and stationing American special task atomic forces equipped with atomic weapons on the territory of other countries. Western Europe, Turkey, Iran, Japan, and Okinawa have been designated as possible areas for stationing such forces. It is reported that the U.S. budget message submitted to Congress by President Eisenhower also mentioned the establishment of such forces, pointing out that the U.S. government considers this issue of great significance.

Therefore, it can be said that this is an attempt by the U.S. government to use the territory of other countries that do not have U.S. military bases to prepare for atomic war. Moreover, the U.S. government now feels it can conceal this intention without any need for disguises.

The U.S. government wants to mislead public opinion in the United States and other countries by saying that this practice is a measure "against possible aggression."

Now the question must be asked: what does this new aggressive step by the U.S. government mean?

Without a doubt, this step by the U.S. government deepens the danger of an atomic war breaking out. It should also be seen that taking this step has another purpose, which is that once the reactionary groups in the United States provoke an atomic war, they can shield the United States from the main counterattack, thus placing the people of Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Turkey, Iran, Japan, and other countries where the U.S. special atomic forces are stationed in the first line of danger of atomic weapons retaliation.

In view of the above reports in the American newspapers, Soviet leaders express their belief that the people of those countries that are about to be dragged into the U.S. plan to prepare for atomic war will certainly recognize the endless troubles caused by the implementation of this aggressive U.S. plan and will therefore resolutely oppose this aggressive plan.

Of course, the consequences arising from the implementation of this plan should not only be borne by the U.S. government, but also by the governments of those countries that agree to provide their territory as a base for preparing for atomic war.

    塔斯社严斥美国新的侵略步骤
    美政府应承担它在别国驻扎原子部队的后果
    供给美国作原子战争基地的国家也负有责任
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科23日讯：塔斯社就美国在别国领土上建立和驻扎原子部队问题发表声明如下：
    据美国报纸说，美国的官方人士现在正在研究这样一个问题：在别国领土上建立和驻扎配备有原子武器的、美国特种任务原子部队。西欧、土耳其、伊朗、日本和冲绳岛被指定为可能驻扎这种部队的地区。报上说，在艾森豪威尔总统提交国会的美国预算咨文中也谈到建立这种部队，咨文中指出，美国政府认为这个问题有很大意义。
    因此可以说，这是美国政府打算利用没有美国军事基地的别国领土来准备原子战争的企图。而且美国政府已认为可以无须隐瞒它的这种意图。
    美国政府想把美国和其他国家的舆论引入迷途，它说这种做法是“反对可能的侵略”的措施。
    现在要提出一个问题：美国政府的这一新的侵略步骤意味着什么呢？
    毫无疑问，美国政府的这一步骤加深了爆发原子战争的危险。也应该看出，采取这种步骤，还有一个目的，这就是要在美国反动集团一旦挑起原子战争的时候，使美国避开主要的反击，也就把英国、法国、西德、意大利、土耳其、伊朗、日本和其他一些驻有美国特种原子部队的国家的人民首先置于原子武器反击的危险中。
    鉴于美国报纸的上述报道，苏联领导人士表示相信，那些要被美国拖入准备原子战争计划的国家的人民一定会认识到实行美国的这种侵略计划是后患无穷的，因而会坚决地反对这种侵略计划。
    当然，对于实行这种计划而引起的后果，不仅应由美国政府承担责任，就是那些同意把本国领土供作准备原子战争基地的国家的政府也负有责任。
