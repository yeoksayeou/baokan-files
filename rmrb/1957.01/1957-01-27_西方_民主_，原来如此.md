    Western “Democracy,” Just Like This
    Before leaving London for an indefinite “vacation” in New Zealand, former British Prime Minister Eden once again defended his policy of aggression against Egypt, saying that "the difference between the West and Egypt is not a question of colonialism," but rather "the difference between democracy and dictatorship." According to Eden, Britain and its accomplices launched an aggression against Egypt in order to replace Egypt's "dictatorship" with Western "democracy."
    As everyone knows, Egypt had suffered greatly from the "benevolence" of Western "democracy" before it got rid of its colonial shackles. It was only in recent years, after the Egyptian people established a nation of national independence, that they gradually eliminated Western "democracy." A recent Associated Press reporter made a meaningful comparison of Egypt's past and present. He wrote: "In the past, a foreigner could stab a person in front of an Egyptian policeman with a knife, and the policeman wouldn't even frown. He could smuggle opium and narcotics, rush through customs, and disregard the customs inspectors. As for taxes, foreigners in the past didn't even know what the word meant"....
    But what about today? The reporter said: "Now things have changed. Foreigners are subject to Egyptian law, and they must appear in Egyptian courts. Sometimes they are imprisoned...." Therefore, "foreigners are gradually feeling uneasy, thinking that this country no longer belongs to them." This is probably the so-called "dictatorship" that Eden and his colleagues hate so much.
    Eden, Mollet, and their gang's efforts to restore Western "democracy" in Egypt did not succeed, so American adventurers believe that they have a responsibility to complete the cause that their "allies" failed to accomplish. In Dulles' words, they want to rebuild the "deterrent force" that Britain and France used to "provide" in the Middle East. This is actually to put the "democracy" that Eden originally prepared to impose on the Egyptian people, labeled with an American trademark, and peddle it to the people of Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries. But no matter what trademark is affixed, it cannot conceal its colonialist essence.
    Eden's kind of "democracy" has been discredited; the Eisenhower Doctrine, which has been rebranded with an American trademark, will not end well either.

### 西方“民主”，原来如此

    西方“民主”，原来如此
    前英国首相艾登在离开伦敦去新西兰无限期“休假”之前，还再一次为他的侵埃政策辩护，说什么“西方和埃及之间的区别不是殖民主义的问题”，“区别在于民主和独裁”。按照艾登的说法，英国和它的同谋者对埃及发动侵略，原是为了要用西方的“民主”来代替埃及的“独裁”。
    大家知道，埃及在摆脱殖民枷锁以前，曾经饱受西方“民主”的“恩泽”，直到近年来埃及人民建立了民族独立的国家，才逐步把西方的“民主”清除掉的。美联社的记者最近对于埃及过去和现在的情况作了一个意味深长的对比。他写道：“在过去，一个外国人可以当着埃及警察的面用刀戳一个人而警察甚至连眉头也不会皱一下。他可以走私鸦片和麻醉药，匆匆通过海关，不把海关稽查员放在眼内。至于税收，外国人在过去甚至连这个字眼的意思也不知道”……。
    但是，今天呢？这位记者说：“现在情况改变了。外国人要受埃及的法律约束，他们必须在埃及法庭出面。有时候，他们被关入监狱。……”因此，“外国人渐渐有一种不安的感觉，认为这个国家已经不再属于他们。”这大概就是艾登和他的同僚们所恨之入骨的所谓“独裁”。
    艾登、摩勒等一伙要在埃及恢复西方“民主”的努力，并没有成功，于是美国的冒险家们就认为他们有责任来完成他们的“盟友”所未能完成的事业。用杜勒斯的话来说，他们要重建英国和法国过去在中东“所提供的威慑力量”。这实际上就是把艾登原来预备强加在埃及人民头上的“民主”，贴上美国的商标来向埃及和其他中东国家人民兜售。可是不管贴的是什么商标，总掩盖不住它的殖民主义的本质。
    艾登之类的“民主”已经声名扫地；改贴上美国商标的艾森豪威尔主义也不会有好下场的。
