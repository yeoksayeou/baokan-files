    Romanian Cadres' Amateur Studies
    Xiao Hang
    Amateur studies are very intense for cadres in Romania. Many high-ranking Party and government cadres, including members of the Party Central Committee and government ministers, participate in correspondence courses at universities along with ordinary cadres. The higher correspondence education system was established in 1950 and currently has more than 18,000 correspondence students.
    While visiting the Red Flag Automobile Factory in Stalin City, we interviewed the factory director, Aladoi George. He was elected as a member of the Central Committee at the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party held in December 1955. He became the factory director in 1951, at the age of only twenty-five. The Red Flag Automobile Factory is a car manufacturing plant with thousands of workers. The scale of production and modern equipment require the director to have a good understanding of modern science. However, before liberation, Aladoi George was just an ordinary car repair worker and had no opportunity to attend university. It was only after liberation that he had the opportunity to make up for his lack of knowledge, entering the workers' preparatory class of a higher education institution in 1949. Before graduating, he was sent to the Albanian Ministry of Industry as a technical advisor, working for two years. After returning to China in 1953, he completed the workers' preparatory class courses and was admitted to the Stalin City Polytechnic Institute to study automobile and tractor manufacturing. He is now a third-year correspondence student.
    This is formal higher correspondence education. The requirements for correspondence students are not much different from those for regular students. The amount of coursework is the same, and the grading standards are the same, only the study time is extended by one year. To meet such high requirements, sufficient self-study time is essential. Aladoi George not only holds the position of factory director, but also assumes certain responsibilities in the Party Central Committee, often working twelve hours a day, yet he still manages to squeeze out three to four hours of self-study every day.
    Many correspondence students have such perseverance. We also visited Peter Unicha, Deputy Chairman of the Oradea Province, Le Du, Secretary-General of the Hungarian Autonomous Region Government, Ion Bucșa, Director of the Stalin Province Economic Planning Committee, Ivan Bedek, Chief Judge of the Timisoara Province Court, Garshi Fajie, First Secretary of the Oradea Municipal Party Committee, Augustin Hamza, Director of the Timisoara Province Investment Bank, and Maria Lambru, Director of the Stalin City Culture Bureau. They all utilized every possible moment. On Sundays, some study for a morning, others for the whole day. During holidays, they stay at home to study. According to government regulations, cadres participating in correspondence courses are given a month's leave each year for examinations. During this month-long vacation (without pay, only a living allowance of 300 lei), most people give up all activities and concentrate on catching up with their coursework. However, as some cadres say, correspondence study cannot be separated from cramming, but it cannot rely solely on cramming. The most important thing is to insist on studying for a few hours every day. Three days of fishing and two days of drying nets will not consolidate knowledge. Therefore, every cadre with relatively good academic performance is good at consistently studying on a regular basis.
    Many female comrades study very well. They are good at squeezing out time and also have great perseverance. Maria Lambru, Director of the Stalin City Culture Bureau, is one of them. She is a mother of two children and is twenty-six years old. She originally only had elementary school education. From 1947 to 1950, she completed the courses from the eighth to eleventh grades in correspondence courses. Later, her studies were interrupted because of childbirth. Now that the children are older and taken care of by her aunt, she has the opportunity to enter the law department of Cluj University as a first-year correspondence student and continue her studies.
    When Maria Lambru participated in secondary school correspondence courses, she was less than twenty years old and loved to play. For a long time, her inner contradictions were very complex. She still remembers that in the winter of 1949, a large-scale ski competition was held in Romania. At that time, she was preparing for the year-end exams and studying was very intense. But she was attracted by the ski competition after all and watched it several times; then she participated in several dances and did not study for a week. She had to stay up all night to cram and catch up on the missed coursework. As a result, her eyesight deteriorated. After that, she understood how to get rid of external temptations. When spring came, young people thought a lot and often had many attractive activities. For example, people often invited her to costume parties, but she reduced such activities as much as possible and buried herself in books. Even so, she still had to stay up late often. At that time, she was still in love, and she had to set aside some time for her lover, accompany her lover to watch movies and take walks... When she returned home at night, it was often eleven o'clock, and she would study with a tired body. Sometimes, she was so sleepy that she couldn't open her eyes, so she put a basin of cold water under the table and soaked her feet in it, relying on this stimulation to invigorate herself. In this way, she forced herself to study for at least two hours every day.
    Cadres all know how to squeeze out time to study, and various units have also established many methods to ensure study time. Many units have reduced the social work of correspondence students as much as possible in accordance with the regulations of the Party and the government. Some units also stipulate that there is a study day every two weeks. On this day, teachers hired to teach basic and theoretical courses give a summary of the coursework learned in the past two weeks and answer questions raised by correspondence students.
    In addition to the time issue, cadres participating in correspondence courses have another difficulty, which is that their basic knowledge is too limited. Most of the basic knowledge they learned in the past has been forgotten. They have rich practical experience, and this experience directly helps their studies; however, because their basic understanding is insufficient, it is still very difficult to independently study theory. To overcome this difficulty, they have come up with many methods. The cadres we visited all talked about this, especially the correspondence students in engineering. Ion Bucșa, who is studying machine manufacturing at the Cluj Institute of Technology, told us that he often had to slow down his progress because he couldn't understand the theoretical part of the textbook. Later, he came up with a way to frequently go to the school to look at the students' notes, which was almost equivalent to attending lectures in class, which helped him understand. Augustin Hamza, Director of the Timisoara Province Investment Bank, is studying in the Department of Finance and Credit at the Bucharest Academy of Economics and National Planning. In the first year, mathematics was the most troublesome subject. Later, with the help of a professor at the Timisoara Institute of Technology, they taught twelve correspondence students for eight hours a week, which lasted for half a year, allowing them to keep up with the class. Last year, he was promoted to the second year, and the most difficult new courses were statistics and Russian. When we visited him, he was cramming for Russian, saying that he had only memorized a thousand words, which was far from enough.
    In order to overcome the difficulties in the cadres' studies, the Party and the government have given a lot of help. Now, Romania has twenty-one departments in ten comprehensive universities and thirty-two departments in ten institutes of technology offering correspondence education. Each department has a correspondence group composed of teachers, and the deputy director of the department is responsible for leading it. The correspondence group regularly or irregularly assigns teachers to give lectures or tutorials to correspondence students. Cadres who live close to the school can go directly to the school for tutorials; those who live far away can submit questions in writing and ask the school to answer them.
    Considering the various difficulties of correspondence students, the Ministry of Education stipulates that correspondence students take examinations once a year. All courses are divided into two examinations, one in February and one in July. Correspondence students decide what to test first and what to test later. If there is no time to participate in both examinations, there is still a make-up examination in October.
    However, the main mode of learning for correspondence students is self-study. The difficulties in learning mainly rely on the cadres themselves to overcome.
    Correspondence education has already had significant effects. Some cadres originally had low levels of education, but after participating in higher education correspondence courses, they are much more confident in the positions they now hold than before. We visited Ivan Bedek, Chief Judge of the Timisoara Province Court, who was formerly an elementary school graduate. He is thirty-three years old and came from a mechanical worker background. In 1948, Romania carried out reforms in the court system, and the Party and the government dispatched a group of workers to work in the courts. At that time, he was also sent to the court to assist judges in their work as a worker. However, he lacked the necessary legal knowledge, and there were many difficulties in his work. Soon, the Party transferred him to a secondary law school. This is an accelerated school specially designed for legal workers from worker backgrounds, initially a one-year system, which was later changed to a two-year system. He studied here for a year and received the title of outstanding student. After graduation, in 1949, he served as a judge in the Cluj Municipal Court. This is Romania's first judge from a worker background. However, the situation of knowledge being incompatible with the job position was still very obvious. So in 1950, he was admitted to the law department of Cluj University as a correspondence student, and in the following year, he participated in the study of the provincial night Party school. He finished the night Party school in 1953, finished the law department of Cluj University in 1954, and participated in the national examination of the university in 1955, with five points in each subject. In this way, he armed himself with the Marxist-Leninist legal scientific knowledge and became a capable legal worker. Because of his outstanding work, he received the National Labor Medal.
    Romanian cadres have a strong enthusiasm for learning. In 1956, the enrollment quota for higher correspondence education was two hundred people, but the number of applicants was as high as one thousand five hundred. Many cadres study another major after completing one major. Some cadres have just graduated from the three-year night Party school and immediately apply to the Institute of Technology. Some cadres were admitted to comprehensive universities in the first year and also participated in night Party school studies in the second year, with the two studies progressing simultaneously. Garshi Fajie, First Secretary of the Oradea Municipal Party Committee, finished the Bucharest Academy of Social Sciences in 1954, and then studied electrical courses on his own, preparing to apply to the Institute of Technology to study electrical engineering. He came from an electrical worker background and has a strong passion for electrical engineering.
    Now, as the scale of higher correspondence education is growing, the leadership of the Ministry of Education has also been strengthened. The biggest problem at present is still that correspondence students have too little study time. At the beginning of the implementation of the correspondence system, the Council of Ministers requested in a resolution that all departments ensure the study time of correspondence students. However, some departments do not understand the significance of improving the cultural and political level of cadres and have not seriously implemented this resolution, and even give correspondence students some extra work, squeezing out their amateur study time, so that many people cannot take the exams on time and are repeatedly postponed. Some people have affected their health because they often stay up late. The time issue has become one of the fundamental problems in higher correspondence education, and the Ministry of Education is discussing solutions with various departments.
    The government has such a provision: leading cadres who have graduated from secondary technical schools and have five years of work experience, even if they do not participate in correspondence courses, can participate in the examination, and if they pass, they will be issued a certificate. This provision provides great convenience for many leading cadres who are busy with work all day long. This method was once suspended, but now it has been restored. Peter Unicha, Deputy Chairman of the Oradea Province, who came from a lathe worker background, was admitted to the Bucharest Institute of Architecture as a correspondence student in 1952, but later interrupted his studies after only one year because he was too busy with work. According to the government's regulations, he can now participate in the national examination. He is also preparing to participate in the national examination and is confident of obtaining a diploma.
    A new situation in Romanian higher correspondence education is: this year, the financial department made a new decision that no matter what job position, as long as it requires cadres with a higher education degree, cadres are required to have this degree. If the cadre only has a secondary or elementary school education, even if he is competent, the original salary will be reduced by 6% to 15% until he obtains a higher education diploma, and then the full salary will be paid. This system is currently only being piloted in the financial department. According to comrades in the Ministry of Education who manage higher correspondence education, this system will be promoted to all departments in the future, with the aim of encouraging all cadres to study hard and be able to have a high level of culture.

    罗马尼亚干部的业余学习
    萧航
    罗马尼亚的干部业余学习十分紧张。有许多党和政府的高级干部，包括党的中央委员，政府的部长，都同一般干部一起，参加高等学校的函授学习。高等函授教育制度是1950年建立的，现在有一万八千多名函授生。
    在参观斯大林城的红旗汽车厂的时候，我们访问了厂长阿拉多伊·乔治。他是在1955年12月举行的罗马尼亚工人党第二次代表大会上当选为中央委员的。他在1951年当厂长，当时只有二十五岁。红旗汽车厂是拥有几千工人的汽车制造厂，工厂的生产规模和现代化的设备，要求厂长能够通晓现代科学。然而，阿拉多伊·乔治在解放以前只是一个普通的汽车修配工人，没有机会进大学。直到解放以后，他才有可能来弥补知识上的缺陷，1949年进入高等学校的工人预备班学习。没有等到毕业就被派到阿尔巴尼亚工业部当技术顾问，工作了两年。1953年回国以后，才学完工人预备班的课程，考入斯大林城的多科性的工学院，学习汽车和拖拉机制造专业，现在是三年级的函授生。
    这是正规的高等函授教育。学校对函授生的要求，同一般学生差不了多少，课程分量相同，考试记分标准也一样，只是学习时间延长一年。要达到这样高的要求，非有充分的自学时间不可。阿拉多伊·乔治不仅担负着厂长职务，而且在党的中央委员会里也担负了一定的工作，常常一天要工作十二小时，可是他每天仍然能够挤出三四个小时来自学。
    许多函授生都有这样的毅力。我们还访问过俄拉第亚省副主席彼得·吴尼查，匈牙利族自治州政府秘书长勒杜，斯大林省经济计划委员会主任布克沙·约恩，底密索拉省法院审判长贝代克·伊万，俄拉第亚市委第一书记法日埃·加希，底密索拉省投资银行行长哈木兹阿·奥古斯丁，斯大林市文化局局长郎布格·玛丽亚，他们都利用了一切可能利用的时间。星期日，有的学习一个上午，有的学习一整天。节日放假，也关在家里学习。按照政府的规定，参加函授学习的干部，每年考试一次，给假一个月。在这一个月的假期当中（不发工资，只发生活费罗币三百列伊），大家多半都放弃一切活动，集中力量赶功课。然而这正像有些干部所说的，函授学习离不开突击，可也不能单靠突击，最重要的还是每天要坚持学习几小时。三天打鱼，两天晒网，知识不能巩固。所以每一个学习成绩比较好的干部，都是善于坚持经常的学习的。
    有许多女同志学习得很好，她们善于挤时间，也有很好的毅力。斯大林市文化局局长郎布格·玛丽亚就是其中的一个。她是有两个孩子的母亲，现年二十六岁。她原来只有小学程度，1947年到1950年间，在函授学习中读完了八年级到十一年级的课程，后来因为生孩子，学习中断了。现在孩子长大了，又有姑母照管，她才有机会考入克鲁日大学法律系，作为一年级的函授生，继续学习。
    郎布格·玛丽亚参加中等学校函授学习的时候，还不到二十岁，很爱玩。在很长时间内，她的内心矛盾是很复杂的。她还记得，1949年的冬天，在罗马尼亚举行过规模很大的滑雪比赛。当时她正准备年终考试，学习很紧张。但是毕竟被滑雪比赛所吸引，看了几次；接着又参加了几次舞会，一个星期没有学习。只好连续开夜车，突击补习拖下来的功课。结果，把眼睛弄近视了。这以后，她懂得了应该怎样摆脱外界的引诱。春天来了，青年人想得很多，也常常有很多吸引人的活动。比仿，常常有人来请参加化装舞会，但她尽可能地减少了这样的活动，埋头读书。即使这样，她还是要常常开夜车。那时候，她还正在谈恋爱，她必须留出一部分时间给她的爱人，陪爱人看电影、散步……。晚上回到家里，常常是十一点钟了，带着一身的疲劳来学习。有时候，困得眼也睁不开，就放一盆冷水在桌子底下，把脚浸进去，靠了这种刺激，使精神振奋一下。这样，她每天都强迫自己至少学习两个小时。
    干部们都懂得挤时间学习，各单位也定了很多保证学习时间的办法。许多单位都按照党和政府的规定，尽可能地减少了函授生的社会工作。有的单位还规定每两周有一个学习日。在这一天，由聘请来的基础课和理论课教师，把两周来所学的功课，提纲挈领地讲一次，并且解答函授生提出的问题。
    参加函授学习的干部，除了时间问题以外，还有另外一个困难，就是基础知识太少。过去他们学到的一些基础知识多半忘掉了。他们有丰富的实际经验，这些经验也直接帮助了他们的学习；但是因为基础认识不够，独立钻研理论毕竟还有很大困难。为了克服这种困难，他们想出了很多办法。我们访问过的干部，都谈到这一点，特别是工科的函授生。在克鲁日工学院学习机器制造专业的布克沙·约恩告诉我们，他常常因为读不懂教材的理论部分，不得不放慢进度。后来，他想出了一种办法，经常跑到学校拿学生的笔记来看，这几乎等于在课堂上听讲，帮助了他的理解。底密索拉省投资银行行长哈木兹阿·奥古斯丁，在布加勒斯特的经济和国家计划学院财政信贷系学习，一年级的时候，数学是最头疼的一门课。后来得到底密索拉工学院教授的帮助，每周给他们十二个函授生讲授八小时，一直连续了半年，使他们跟上了课。去年他升到二年级，最困难的新课程是统计学和俄文。我们访问他的时候，他正突击学习俄文，他说他现在只记了一千个单字，远不够用。
    为了克服干部学习上的困难，党和政府给了很多帮助。现在罗马尼亚有十所综合大学的二十一个系、十所工学院的三十二个系举办函授教育，每个系都有一个由教师组成的函授小组，系的副主任负责领导，函授小组定期或不定期地分派教师给函授生讲课或上辅导课。离学校近的干部，都可以直接到学校去上辅导课；远的，可以书面提出问题，请学校解答。
    考虑到函授生的各方面的困难，教育部规定，函授生每年考试一次。全部功课分两次考试，2月、7月各一次。先考什么后考什么，全由函授生自己决定。如果两次考试都没有时间参加，10月间还可以补考。
    但是，函授生的主要学习方式是自学。学习当中的困难，主要还是依靠干部自己去克服的。
    函授教育已经有了显著的效果。有些干部原来文化水平很低，但在参加高等学校的函授学习以后，对现在所担负的职务，比从前是有把握得多了。我们访问过不久以前还是小学程度的底密索拉省法院审判长贝代克·伊万。他现年三十三岁，机械工人出身。1948年，罗马尼亚进行法院工作改革，党和政府派遣了一批工人到法院工作。当时他也被派到法院，任务是以工人的身份帮助法官工作。但是他缺乏必要的法律知识，工作中的困难很多。不久，党把他调到中等法律学校学习。这是一种速成性质的学校，专为工人出身的法律工作者而设的，最初是一年制，后来改为二年制。他在这里学习了一年，获得优秀生的称号。毕业之后，1949年担任克鲁日市法院审判员。这是罗马尼亚的第一名工人出身的审判员。但是，知识同工作岗位不相称的情形，仍然很明显。于是在1950年考入克鲁日大学法律系当函授生，并且又在第二年参加了省夜党校的学习。他在1953年读完夜党校，1954年读完克鲁日大学法律系，1955年参加了大学的国家考试，每门功课都是五分。这样，他就用马克思列宁主义的法律科学知识武装了起来，成为能干的法律工作者。因为工作出色，他得到了国家的劳动勋章。
    罗马尼亚的干部有旺盛的学习情绪。1956年高等函授教育的招生名额是二百人，报名的多到一千五百人。许多干部在读完了一种专业之后，又学习另一种专业。有的干部在三年制的夜党校刚刚毕业，马上又考入工学院。有的干部第一年考入综合大学，第二年又参加了夜党校学习，两种学习同时并进。俄拉第亚市委第一书记法日埃·加希，1954年读完了布加勒斯特社会科学院之后，接着自修电机方面的课程，准备投考工学院，学习电机专业。他是电机工人出身，对电机有热烈的爱好。
    现在，由于高等函授教育的规模越来越大，教育部的领导也加强了。目前最大的问题仍然是函授生的学习时间太少。函授制度实行之初，部长会议就在一项决议中要求各部门保证函授生的学习时间。但是有些部门对提高干部文化和政治水平的意义了解得不够，没有认真执行这个决议，甚至还额外地给函授生一些工作，把他们的业余学习时间挤掉了，以致好多人不能按时考试，一再延期。有些人因为常常开夜车，影响了健康。时间问题已经成了高等函授教育当中的根本问题之一，教育部正同各部门商量解决办法。
    政府有这样的规定：凡是具有中等技术学校毕业水平，并且有五年工作经验的领导干部，即使不参加函授学习，也可以参加考试，如果及格，就发给证书。这个规定给许多终日忙于工作的领导干部以很大的方便。这个办法曾一度停止实行，现在又恢复了。旋工出身的俄拉第亚省副主席彼得·吴尼查，曾经在1952年考入布加勒斯特的建筑学院当函授生，后来因为工作太忙，只学了一年，中断了。根据政府的规定，他现在可以参加国家考试。他也正在准备参加国家考试，而且有信心得到毕业证书。
    罗马尼亚高等函授教育方面的新情况是：今年财政部门作了一个新的决定，不论什么工作岗位，只要它需要高等学校毕业程度的干部，就要求干部具有这种程度。如果干部只有中学或小学的文化程度，即令是胜任的，也要减发原工资的6％到15％，直到他拿到高等学校的毕业证书，才发全工资。这个制度目前还只在财政部门试行。据教育部管理高等函授教育工作的同志谈，这个制度将来要推广到各个部门去，目的是鼓励全体干部努力学习，都能够具有高度的文化水平。
