Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 29th. Hungarian Minister of State Marosan delivered a lengthy speech at a mass meeting in Pécs on January 27th.

When discussing the Hungarian economic situation, Marosan said that the improved coal and electricity production, coupled with the assistance of friendly countries, has enabled our daily necessities industrial production to exceed the highest level we hoped for in December last year. Therefore, the supply to residents will be further improved. The government will do its utmost to support handicraft cooperatives.

Regarding the principles of building socialism, Marosan said, we do not say that we are building socialism in a "Hungarian way," but rather that we are taking into account Hungary's economic factors when building socialism. We do not aim too high, harbor illusions, nor intend to simply copy others' practices, but we take into account the effective experience of the socialist international camp.

Marosan also specifically talked about the activities of Hungarian writers and journalists and the situation of school education. He said that the government had patiently waited for the writers to change their positions. Some writers have recognized the actual situation and changed their positions. Some writers have found the correct path to serve the people. However, some writers regard this patient waiting attitude as the government's weakness, so the government had to arrest those writers and journalists who had directly participated in ideological mobilization before the armed rebellion and are still continuing to instigate trouble, and temporarily suspended the activities of the Writers' Association and the Journalists' Association.

Marosan said that the Workers and Peasants Revolutionary Government will do everything possible to support writers who serve the interests of the people and socialism, but will never tolerate writers who promote national chauvinism and spread petty-bourgeois anarchist views. Communist writers and all progressive writers should get rid of the influence of those writers, should serve the interests of the people, and support the people's regime.

Regarding the issue of freedom of the press, he said that we guarantee journalists the greatest possible freedom, but this freedom can only serve the interests of the people and be built on the basis of people's democracy and socialism. If our journalists understand this, then they can bravely write about any issue. We need lively and interesting newspapers, but these newspapers cannot run counter to the task of persuasion and education. The press must fight against national chauvinism, against petty-bourgeois anarchist views, and strive to expand and realize socialist democracy.

Regarding the situation of schools, Marosan said that counter-revolutionaries now want to use universities again to spread their reactionary views. In some places, they are even plotting to organize armed forces. He emphasized that we must educate college students with Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, Marxism-Leninism will still be taught in higher education in the future. The government is working hard to restore order in schools and resolutely opposes all attempts to carry out agitation activities in schools, so that schools will no longer be a place for all reactionary instigation and riots.

Finally, when talking about foreign policy, Marosan said that the government's foreign policy is firmly based on the principles of proletarian internationalism and the eternal friendship with the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp. We are pleased to see that the victory of our Polish friends' elections has further strengthened this camp.

    马罗山谈匈牙利国内情况和外交政策
    坚持建设社会主义的原则，反对民族沙文主义、无政府主义和反革命阴谋，并以国际主义原则和社会主义各国的友谊作为外交政策的基础。
    新华社布达佩斯29日电　匈牙利国务部长马罗山27日在贝奇城的群众大会上发表了长篇演说。
    马罗山在谈到匈牙利经济状况的时候说，目前煤和电力生产情况的好转，加上友好国家的帮助，使我们的日用品工业生产超过了我们在去年12月所希望的最高水平。因此对居民的供应将进一步得到改善。政府将竭尽全力给予手工业合作社以支持。
    关于建设社会主义的原则，马罗山说，我们不说我们在按照“匈牙利方式”建设社会主义，而是说，我们在建设社会主义的时候考虑到匈牙利的经济因素，我们不好高鹜远，不存幻想，也无意一味抄袭别人的做法，但是我们考虑到社会主义国际阵营的行之有效的经验。
    马罗山还特别谈到了目前匈牙利作家和记者的活动和学校教育的情况。他说，政府曾经耐心地等待作家们改变立场。有一部分作家认识到了实际的情况而改变了立场。有些作家已经找到了为人民服务的正确道路。但是还有些作家把这种耐心等待的态度看成是政府的软弱，因此政府不得不把那些曾经在武装暴乱前直接参与思想动员工作而现在还继续进行挑拨煽动的作家和记者逮捕，并且暂时停止了作家协会和记者协会的活动。
    马罗山说，工农革命政府尽一切可能支持为人民和社会主义的利益服务的作家们，但是决不会姑息那些宣扬民族沙文主义和散布小资产阶级无政府主义观点的作家。共产党员作家和一切进步的作家都应该摆脱那些作家的影响，都应该为人民的利益服务，拥护人民政权。
    关于新闻自由的问题，他说，我们保证给新闻工作者以最大限度的自由，但是这种自由只能是为人民利益服务的和建筑在人民民主和社会主义的基础上的。如果我们的记者们懂得这点，那他们就可以勇敢地去写任何一个问题。我们要有活泼的引人发生兴趣的报纸，但是这种报纸不能与说服教育的任务背道而驰。新闻必须为反对民族沙文主义、反对小资产阶级无政府主义的观点、为争取扩大和实现社会主义民主而斗争。
    关于学校的情况，马罗山说，反革命分子现在又想利用大学来散布他们的反动观点。有些地方甚至在阴谋组织武装。他强调说，我们必须以马克思列宁主义教育大学生。因此在高等教育中将来还是要讲授马克思列宁主义。政府正努力恢复学校中的秩序和坚决地反对一切想在学校里进行煽动活动的企图，使学校不再是一切反动挑拨和暴乱的场所。
    马罗山最后在谈到外交政策问题的时候，政府的外交政策坚定不移地以无产阶级国际主义的原则和同苏联以及社会主义阵营各国的永恒的友谊为基础。我们高兴地看到，我们波兰朋友们的选举的胜利进一步加强了这个阵营。
