Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 2nd -- The "Independent" newspaper said in an editorial today entitled "The Voice of Washington" that the Associated Press recently reported that U.S. officials believe that a cabinet of experts led by former Vice President Hatta, composed of specialists capable of solving the economic problems that caused the current rebellion, could resolve Indonesia's chaotic political situation. The editorial pointed out that the report gives the impression that the voice of Washington is exactly the same as the voice of the opposition here.

The editorial believes that if this news is true, then these words must have come from officials of the U.S. State Department. This U.S. action seems to be expressing its opinion on the current cabinet, showing that U.S. foreign policy unconsciously has the aim of attempting to overthrow the current Indonesian cabinet. At the same time, the United States seems to be pleased with the military rebellion that occurred in Sumatra and believes that this brings good "hope" to the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 2nd -- According to a report by Antara News Agency, a battalion of approximately 200 men belonging to the Third Regiment of the First Military Region has defected from the Third Regiment, left their station in trucks, and reported to the new First Military Region Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Djatikusumo, in Medan.

Colonel Simosir, commander of the Third Regiment stationed in Tapanuli, Central Sumatra, is considered to be a henchman of former First Military Region Commander Simbolon. The Third Regiment recently announced its disobedience to the command of Lieutenant Colonel Djatikusumo, the First Military Region Commander who has restored contact with the central government. Simbolon and his followers recently fled to the Third Regiment headquarters in Tarutung.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 2nd -- According to a report in the "Eastern Star" today, the responsible authorities in Jakarta arrested four Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang elements participating in Simbolon's conspiracy group on December 30, 1956, and confiscated a batch of important documents.

    印度尼西亚“独立报”发表社论
    抨击美国干涉印度尼西亚内政
    西姆波朗部队纷纷向新军区司令报到
    蒋介石分子参与西姆波朗的阴谋活动
    据新华社雅加达2日电　“独立报”今天在题为“华盛顿的声音”的社论中说，合众社最近曾经报道说，美国的官方人士认为，由前副总统哈达领导、由那些能够解决引起目前叛乱的经济问题的专门人才组成事务内阁，就可能解决印度尼西亚混乱的政局。社论指出，这个报道给人这样的一个印象：华盛顿的声音和这里反对派的声音一模一样。
    社论认为，这个消息如果是确实的，那么这番话一定是出自美国国务院官员之口。美国这种行动似乎也是对现任内阁表示它的意见，显示了美国的外交政策不自觉地具有企图推翻现任印度尼西亚内阁的目的。同时美国方面对苏门答腊岛所发生的军事叛变似乎感到高兴，并且认为这给美国带来了良好的“希望”。
    据新华社雅加达2日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，属于第一军区第三团的一个营共约二百人已经脱离了第三团，坐卡车离开驻地到棉兰向新任第一军区司令京廷中校报到。
    驻在中苏门答腊打板奴里州的第三团的团长沙莫西尔上校被认为是前第一军区司令西姆波朗的党羽。第三团最近宣布不服从同中央政府恢复联系的第一军区司令京廷中校的指挥。西姆波朗和他的追随者最近逃到了在打鲁栋的第三团司令部。
    据新华社雅加达2日电　据“东星报”今天报道，雅加达负责当局在1956年12月30日逮捕了四名参加西姆波朗阴谋集团的蒋介石国民党分子，并且没收了一批重要文件。
