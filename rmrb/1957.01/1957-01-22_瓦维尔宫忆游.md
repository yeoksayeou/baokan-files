    Memories of a Visit to Wawel Castle
    Zhou Hao
    Recently, the Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai visited Wawel Castle, an ancient cultural city in Krakow, southern Poland. I also visited Wawel Castle last September when I accompanied the Shanghai Acrobatic Troupe on a visit to Poland, and it left me with unforgettable impressions.
    The exterior of Wawel Castle is a medieval fortress-style city wall. After we entered, we first visited the old church here. This church was built in the fourteenth century, and the sculptures inside are extremely exquisite. The coffins of Polish cultural figures Mickiewicz and Słowacki are hidden in the basement of the church. There is also an old bell tower in the church. We wound our way up the narrow wooden ladder. The large bell on the roof was cast in 1700 and weighs eighteen tons. It takes eight people pulling the rope at the same time to ring it. Looking down from the window of the bell tower, there is a park opposite, with many visitors inside.
    Not far from the church is the museum. To enter, you must first put on felt shoes, which keeps it quiet and protects the floor. The museum displays carvings about religious stories. The most eye-catching is the thirteen wooden statues of the Virgin Mary and the twelve apostles expressing their grief after hearing about Christ's death. On closer inspection, each statue has a different facial expression and lifelike form.
    Turning right from the museum is Wawel Castle. In the center is a square, surrounded by buildings on three sides, and an entrance and exit on one side. The square was used for noble duels, and the winner could obtain what both sides were fighting for (such as land). Wawel Castle was originally built of wood, but was destroyed by fire. It was rebuilt in the sixteenth century, built of stone according to the architectural characteristics of the Renaissance. Later, it was damaged again during the Swedish invasion, and in the early seventeenth century, there were seven consecutive days of major fires. It was not until the reign of King Baroque that it was rebuilt in its original form using Polish marble. Inside the gate tower, several hand-woven tapestries are hanging, woven with ancient Roman war stories, which were carefully woven by famous craftsmen in the seventeenth century. Each tapestry is about three meters high and four or five meters wide, but a worker can only weave one or two square meters a year, so it takes dozens of workers more than ten years to complete. There were originally more than two hundred of these tapestries with pictures, which were lost when Hitler's fascists occupied Poland. Later, they were scattered in West Germany, the United States, and other countries. The few that remain were bought back from Canadians at great expense.
    Climbing to the second floor, you can see a large oil painting depicting the scene of the Polish army defeating the Turkish army in 1673. There are also some ancient weapons on display, including giant swords used by cavalry in the sixteenth century, each weighing seven or eight kilograms. The first room to the left on the second floor is called the Traveler's Room, which is named after the murals, and the walls are painted with the activities of travelers. The second room is called the Parade Room, and the murals depict military activities. There is also a third room called the Head Room, and the ceiling is painted with portraits of high-ranking officials and dignitaries who frequently visited the court in the sixteenth century. At that time, whenever court ministers and envoys from various countries came to see the king, they had to wait in the first and second rooms, and enter the third room to see the king after hearing the summons. The first room on the right side of the second floor displays iron armor of ancient warriors. The second room contains a map of the Crusades painted in 1571. The last room is the architecture of the Baroque King's period who rebuilt Wawel Castle as mentioned earlier, which is magnificent and splendid. The paintings on the ceiling adopt the Venetian style. The last room is a rectangular hall, which was used by the royal family for banquets during festive coronations. The walls are hung with large tapestries captured after defeating the Turks at that time, which are dozens of meters long and more than ten meters high. They are hand-woven by Persian slaves. From the exquisite patterns on them, we can see how much effort the Persian working people have spent on this!

    瓦维尔宫忆游
    周皓
    最近，以周恩来总理为首的我国政府代表团，在访问波兰时曾参观了波兰南部的文化古城克拉科夫的瓦维尔古宫。去年9月我随上海杂技团访问波兰时也曾参观过瓦维尔宫，它给了我难忘的印象。
    瓦维尔宫的外面，是中世纪碉堡式的城墙。我们进去后先参观了这里的古老的教堂。这座教堂建于十四世纪，里面的雕塑极为精美。教堂的地下室中藏着波兰的文化名人密茨凯维奇和斯洛瓦斯基的棺木。教堂里还有一座古老的钟楼，我们绕着狭小的木梯辗转侧身而上。屋顶的大钟铸于1700年，重达十八吨，须八个人同时拉起绳来才能敲响。从钟楼的窗口向下眺望，对面是一座公园，里面的游人很多。
    出教堂不远就是博物馆。进去参观必须先绑上毡鞋，这样可以保持安静，并保护地板。馆内陈列着关于宗教故事的雕刻。其中最引人注目的是圣母玛丽亚和十二个门徒闻悉基督遇难后的悲痛神情的十三个木雕像，仔细看来，每个雕像的面部表情都不相同，形态逼真。
    从博物馆出来向右转就是瓦维尔宫，正中是广场，三面是房屋，一面是出入口。广场是作贵族决斗用的，胜利的就可以取得双方所争之物（如土地等）。瓦维尔宫最初是木建的，后来毁于大火，十六世纪时再建，按文艺复兴时期的建筑特点以石块建成。其后瑞典人入侵时又受损，十七世纪初并连续有七天的大火灾，至国王巴罗克统治时期才又照原样用波兰大理石重建。进宫门楼下的室内悬挂着几幅手织壁毯，上织古代罗马战争故事，是十七世纪时由名手精工织成的。每幅壁毯高约三公尺，阔约四、五公尺，但一个工人一年只能织一、二平方公尺，因此要几十个工人连织十几年才能完工。这种织着图画的壁毯原有二百多幅，希特勒法西斯侵占波兰时失散，其后分别流散西德、美国等国，现存的几幅是辗转从加拿大人手中用重金买回的。
    登上一楼时看见一幅大油画，描绘1673年波兰军队战胜土耳其军队的情景。还陈列着一些古老的武器，有十六世纪时骑兵用的巨剑，每把重达七、八公斤。二楼向左入第一室称为旅行者室，这是以壁画命名，四壁都画着旅行者的活动。第二室名阅兵室，壁画是军队的活动。还有第三室叫人头室，天花板上画着十六世纪时经常往来于宫廷的达官贵人的头像。当时，凡朝廷大臣及各国使节来朝见国王，须先在第一、第二室等候，听闻召唤后入第三室觐见。二楼右面第一室陈列着古代武士的铁制甲胄。第二室内有1571年绘就的十字军东征图。以次数室是前面所说的重建瓦维尔宫的巴罗克王时期的建筑，华丽堂皇，天花板上的绘画采用威尼斯式样。最后一间是长方形的大厅，系王室逢喜庆加冕时开宴会所用。四壁挂着当时战胜土耳其人后缴获的大壁毯，长达数十公尺，高也有十余公尺，是波斯奴隶的手织品，从那上面精致的图案可以看出，波斯劳动人民曾为此耗费多少心血啊！
