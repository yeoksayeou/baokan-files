    Four Days in the Viet Bac Autonomous Region
    —Vietnamese Sketches
    Yuan Ying

    Will you still remember
    This thatched cottage and the sincere friendship within?
    Will you still remember this forest,
    Remember when the anti-Japanese war and the Viet Minh were still here?

The above four lines of poetry are from the Vietnamese famous poet To Huu's long poem "Viet Bac". In that long poem that was once widely circulated, the poet bid farewell to the old revolutionary base of Viet Bac with such sincere and profound feelings, "cherishing it like cherishing a lover" – the mountains and rivers and people of Viet Bac. According to Vietnamese friends, this poem represents the feelings of many people who have returned from the old revolutionary base of Viet Bac to the plains.

We, a few people from China, are naturally different from our Vietnamese friends, but somehow, on the way to Thai Nguyen, we also had a particularly excited and particularly kind feeling.

About an hour after leaving Hanoi, the car entered the hilly area with lush trees. The bunkers left by the French colonial army on both sides of the highway went from dense to sparse, and then disappeared. We have entered Viet Bac, the hometown of the resistance war.

      A City Rising from the Ruins

Thai Nguyen City—once known as the capital of the resistance war and now the capital of the Viet Bac Autonomous Region—came before us with a posture of having endured many hardships, but still standing tall.

Thai Nguyen City was originally a city of considerable size. The scorched earth policy during the anti-Japanese war and the repeated invasions by the French colonial army turned the city into a field of rubble. Walking on the wide avenue, we could only imagine its past appearance from some broken tiles and ruined walls.

However, this city has risen from the ruins after all. Although it still bears scars all over, although on the old sites of the high-rise buildings and wide roads of the past, trees thick enough for two people to hug have grown, it has still risen. On the streets, thatched houses topped with bamboo or palm leaves are everywhere, and government offices are no exception. Although the houses are simple, they are very solid; although the city is not as lively as Hanoi, Haiphong, or Nam Dinh, it is full of a new atmosphere everywhere.

Yes, here, we can see more of the arduous years of the anti-Japanese war. This city, from its natural environment to the style of the cadres and people, retains the characteristics of the anti-Japanese war. Take the chairman of the Thai Nguyen City Administrative Committee, who accompanied us to visit the city, he is so simple, unadorned, sincere and enthusiastic; his clothing is also so simple, that suit of clothes is probably still the old uniform from the anti-Japanese war period; the anti-Japanese shoes on his feet seem to have not yet washed away the dust from the remote mountains and valleys.

          A Laboratory

The car traveled along the rugged mountain road and arrived at the gate of Luong Ngoc Quyen Middle School.

This school, like other constructions in the Viet Bac Autonomous Region, is full of vigor and vitality. It is located on a hillside. All the school buildings are mud-walled, palm leaf-roofed, and earth-floored. Its teachers are almost as young as the students.

In that area of ​​thatched houses, there is a newly built house made of bricks and cement, which is naturally particularly eye-catching. We estimated that if it was not an office, it must be an auditorium. However, after walking in and taking a look, we realized that we were completely wrong. It turned out to be a laboratory. The laboratory was full of instruments and specimens. Except for a small part that came from East Germany, the rest were mostly from China.

    "We use the best houses to put these instruments and specimens," the teacher who led us to visit said: "On the day of the school opening, we also plan to hold a public exhibition to invite the masses to visit. The purpose of the exhibition is, on the one hand, to let the masses come into contact with some new knowledge, and on the other hand, to let them once again experience the friendship between Vietnam and China and Germany."

His words were so touching that when we walked out of the school gate, we couldn’t help but look back at the laboratory again and again.

            Cau River Today and Yesterday

We braved the rain and followed the mountain road that was sometimes high and sometimes low, and arrived at the Thac Huong sluice gate on the Cau River.

Thac Huong sluice gate is a famous water conservancy project in Viet Bac. The entire water conservancy project includes a canal of more than fifty kilometers, an irrigation ditch of one hundred and fifty kilometers, and ten sluice gates. The French colonialists, starting from 1923, spent fourteen years, exhausting the blood and sweat of tens of millions of Vietnamese laborers, to complete the entire water conservancy project.

Of course, the French colonialists had their own plans when they opened canals and built sluice gates on Vietnamese land: after this canal was built, it became a blood-sucking vessel inserted into the mountainous area of ​​Viet Bac. The colonialists transported iron and coal from Thai Nguyen, tin from Cao Bang, and various resources from the mountainous area of ​​Viet Bac from this river. The nearly 20,000 hectares of land through which the canal and irrigation ditches flowed did not belong to the Vietnamese peasants, but entirely to three French agricultural capitalists. In addition, this canal also transported teams of colonial troops from the plains to the mountainous areas time and time again to suppress the revolutionary movement in the Bac Giang and Thai Nguyen areas, and to massacre the good people of Viet Bac.

After the August Revolution, the French colonialists were driven out of this land, and the 20,000 hectares of land irrigated by the Thac Huong water conservancy project became the granary of the old revolutionary base of Viet Bac. During the eight years of the anti-Japanese war, the French colonial army constantly bombed this area, and they did not hesitate to use the most barbaric means to destroy this water conservancy project. On June 29, 1952, French aircraft bombed the Van Nha sluice gate, dropping sixteen tons of bombs in one day.

However, can bombs save the colonialists from their doomed fate? The Thac Huong sluice gate still belongs to the Vietnamese people. Today we come here, and the large sluice gate towering over the Cau River has long been repaired. It stands on the river like a tall steel wall, and the river water flows down from under its feet like ten thousand horses galloping. The sound of the river is mighty, mocking the colonialists' shameful end, and showing the endless power of the Vietnamese people.

          Eight-Foot-Wide Highway

Leaving Thai Nguyen City to the northeast, we walked onto a wide highway. The roads in Viet Bac are mostly rugged and uneven, but this highway is surprisingly flat. It crosses hills, passes through valleys, and stretches into the plain surrounded by high mountains and ridges, like a big river.

Everyone in Viet Bac knows this highway, and everyone who has lived in Viet Bac remembers it. People call it the "Eight-Foot-Wide Highway" with pride and affection.

Walking on this highway, we think of To Huu's poem:

    We advance in the bright sunshine,
    We walk lightly and calmly on the main road,
    Walking on the eight-foot-wide highway.
    That is from Bac Son, Dinh Ca, leading to Thai Nguyen,
    That is passing through the Northwest, that is going to Dien Bien Phu,
    That is the road of revolution, it grows with the anti-Japanese war.

"It grows with the anti-Japanese war," this sentence most appropriately answers why people always talk about this highway so affectionately. This highway was originally an ordinary mountain road, neither wide nor flat. Its proud body grew up in the anti-Japanese war. This road starts from the Sino-Vietnamese border in Lang Son in the east and reaches the Northwest battlefield directly to the west. Due to strategic needs, it gradually widened, and how many people stepped on it, and how much sweat of Viet Bac laborers dripped on the road surface. Finally, in order to support the Dien Bien Phu campaign, hundreds of thousands of laborers rushed to repair it with all their strength. During the day, when French planes came to harass, there was no one on the road, only the stern high mountains and jungles on both sides of the highway coldly welcomed the French aerial robbers; at night, people came out of the caves and forests, and the highway was full of countless lights and torches, like a fire dragon rolling in the dark night that could not see the beginning and the end.

A week after the completion of the Eight-Foot-Wide Highway, Dien Bien Phu was liberated.

Over the past ten years, this highway, which has experienced vicissitudes, has personally witnessed how the strong sons and daughters of the Vietnamese people fought back against the attacks of Japanese imperialists, and fought back against the repeated invasions of the French colonial army to Viet Bac; on this road, the footsteps of marching south during the August General Uprising were once trod, and countless songs of victory once resounded; finally, it was also this highway that sent away the people who returned to Hanoi and returned to the plains.

This is a highway of victory. The majestic high mountains and lush forests are all its witnesses.

      Dinh Ca Guerrilla Base Area

Along this eight-foot-wide highway, we came to Dinh Ca, forty kilometers away from Thai Nguyen City.

Dinh Ca, according to Vietnamese friends, if translated literally, means "old area". As early as one or two decades ago, it had become the initial revolutionary base area.

Stopping the car by the highway, wading through streams, and passing through bushes and rice fields, we came to the home of an old Nong woman in the mountain depression. According to the customs of the Nong ethnic group, we took off our shoes one by one, climbed the ladder, and entered the building built of bamboo. Right here, we met some old guerrillas. Among them, there was Comrade Chu Quoc Hung, the leader of the guerrilla team in those years and now a member of the Administrative Committee of the Viet Bac Autonomous Region, Comrade Chu Di Phong, who participated in revolutionary activities as early as 1936 and is now a member of the Vu Nhai County Party Committee, and old man Vuong Van Lau, who started helping revolutionary activities in 1933....

The past days have gone far away, and the initial footprints of the guerrilla heroes left on those towering mountains and ridges have long been erased, but in the memories of these old guerrillas, they are always so fresh. They sat cross-legged on the mat on the floor, talking eloquently, as if they were talking about things that happened yesterday or last week.

They talked about how the Party sent cadres to mobilize the masses and organize the struggle against the French colonialists as early as 1933; and how they organized armed guerrillas to cooperate during the Bac Son Uprising in 1940. People still often proudly talk about how the Vu Nhai guerrilla team first fought against the French devils in the forest: the enemy had more than three hundred, surrounded the forest, and the guerrilla team had only four people, and two of the four guns were still bird guns. After the battle started, a melee combat took place. All of a sudden, four devils fell, one of whom was the captain. When the enemy saw that the captain was dead, they all retreated.

The French colonialists surrounded the high mountains and forests, burned down entire villages, drove the folks into concentration camps, and were not allowed to enter or leave at will. The camp gate was opened at eight in the morning and closed at four in the afternoon. Cutting off the connection between the guerrilla team and the folks, the enemy thought that this would starve the guerrilla team to death. However, the people imprisoned in the concentration camps still came up with various ways to support the heroic children in the mountains. They sewed grain in their clothes and handed it to people outside from the fence of the concentration camp, and then sent it to the mountains; children went to the forest to graze cattle, and they also filled their pockets with rice; women went out to fetch water, and their bamboo tubes were also filled with grain. Relying on these grains, the guerrilla team persisted in the mountains. When the grain was eaten, they ate wild vegetables and fruits, and lived on bamboo shoots. Sometimes, they didn’t have salt to eat for several months. However, this still did not frustrate their fighting spirit.

The Dinh Ca guerrilla team grew from nothing to something, from small to large in this way. Before the August General Uprising in 1945, it had developed into a large team, and it participated in the battles to liberate many areas in Viet Bac; at that time, it was no longer a spark, but a prairie fire.

After saying goodbye to the old Nong woman, we also visited the homes of two Tho and Man guerrilla fighters. We expressed the greetings and respect of the Chinese people to them.

In the homes of ethnic minorities in the deep mountain valleys, on the walls made of bamboo planks, we can also see the photos of Chairman Mao, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and Chairman Bulganin hanging side by side. On the shelf, the gun that had fired at the enemy countless times lay quietly; the knife and bow were still hung on the wall majestically. Just one glance at these photos, these guns, knives and bows, without saying a word, the minds of the host and the guest were already blended together.

Viet Bac Autonomous Region, a heroic land! Heroic people!

    在越北自治区的四天
    ——越南随笔
    袁鹰
    你回去后还能不能记得
    这芦苇小屋和屋内诚挚的情谊呢？
    你回去后还能不能记得这里的森林，
    记得抗日战争和越盟还在这里的时候？
    上面这四行诗，是越南著名诗人素友的长诗“越北”里的句子。诗人在那首传诵一时的长诗里，以那样真挚而深厚的感情向越北老根据地告别，“就像怀念着情人一样怀念着”越北的山川和人民。据越南朋友们说，这首诗代表了许多从越北老根据地回到平原上去的人的心情。
    我们这几个来自中国的人，自然不同于我们的越南朋友，但是，不知怎的，在去到太原的路上，却也有着一种特别兴奋，也特别亲切的心情。
    离开河内大约一小时以后，汽车进入了绿树丛生的丘陵地带。公路两旁法国殖民军遗留下的碉堡，由密而疏，由疏而消失。我们已经进入了抗战故乡的越北了。
      从废墟上站起的城市
    太原市——它曾经被称为抗战的首都，如今是越北自治区的首府——以一个饱经患难、可是仍然巍然屹立的姿态来到我们面前。
    太原市，原是一个规模不小的城市。焦土抗战和法国殖民军的屡次侵犯，使这城市成为一片瓦砾场。我们走在宽广的大道上，只能从一些断瓦颓垣去想像它昔日的面貌。
    然而，这个城市毕竟从废墟上站起来了。尽管它还带着遍体的创伤，尽管在当年的高楼和大路的旧址上已经长起粗到足够两人合抱的大树，但是它还是站起来了。街道上，满眼是用竹叶或蒲葵叶盖顶的茅屋，机关也绝不例外。房屋虽然简陋，但是很结实；市容虽然不像河内、海防或者南定那样热闹，但是到处洋溢着新兴的气象。
    是的，在这里，我们还能更多地看见了艰苦卓绝的抗战的岁月。这城市，从自然环境到干部和人民的作风，都保持着抗战的特色。就说那位陪我们参观市区的太原市行政委员会主席吧，他是那样质朴无华、真挚热情；他的服装也是那样朴素，那身衣服，大约还是抗战时期的旧制服；脚下的抗战鞋，好像也还没有洗尽荒山野谷里的尘土。
          一座实验室
    汽车走过崎岖的山路，来到了梁玉娟中学门口。
    这所学校，正同越北自治区的其他建设一样，充满了蓬勃的朝气。它座落在山坡上，所有的校舍房屋，都是泥砌的墙，蒲葵叶盖的顶，土铺的地。它的教师，几乎跟学生一样的年青。
    在那一片草房中，却有着一间新盖的用砖和水泥砌成的房屋，自然特别惹眼。我们估计，如果不是办公室，定是礼堂。然而走进去一看，才知道全猜错了。原来是座实验室。实验室里，放满了仪器和标本。其中除了一小部分来自民主德国以外，其余大部分都是从中国来的。
      “我们用最好的房屋放这些仪器和标本。”领我们参观的教师这样说：“到开学的那一天，我们还打算举行一个公开的展览会，招待群众来参观。展览会的目的，一方面是让群众接触一些新知识，另一方面是让他们再一次体会越南同中国、德国的友谊。”
    他的话说得那样地感动人，使我们走出校门的时候，还禁不住一再回头看看那座实验室。
            球江今昔
    我们冒着雨，沿着忽高忽低的山间公路，来到球江上的拓况水闸。
    拓况水闸是越北著名的水利工程。整个水利工程包括一条五十多公里的运河，一百五十公里的灌溉渠和十个水闸。法国殖民者从1923年起，用了一十四年时间，流尽了千万个越南劳动者的血汗，完成整个水利工程。
    法国殖民者在越南土地上开辟运河、修建水闸，当然有他们的如意算盘：这条运河建成以后，就成为一支插入越北山区的吸血管。殖民者从这条河上，运走了太原的铁和煤，运走了高平的锡，运走了越北山区各种资源。运河和灌溉渠流过的近两万公亩的田地，不是属于越南农民的，全部是属于法国三个农业资本家的。除此以外，这条运河还曾一次次地把一队队殖民军从平原运进山区，去镇压北江、太原一带的革命运动，去屠杀越北的善良的人民。
    八月革命以后，法国殖民者从这块土地上被赶走了，拓况水利工程所灌溉的两万公亩土地，成为越北老根据地的谷仓。在抗战的八年中，法国殖民军不断地轰炸这个地区，他们不惜用最野蛮的手段来毁灭这个水利工程。1952年6月29日，法国飞机轰炸万牙水闸，一天之内投下了十六吨炸弹。
    然而，炸弹能挽救殖民者失败的命运吗？拓况水闸依然是属于越南人民的。今天我们来到这里，雄踞在球江上的大水闸，早已修复了。它像一道高大的钢铁城墙站在江面上，江水从它脚下泻过，像万马奔腾。江声浩荡，在嘲笑殖民者可耻的下场，在显示越南人民的无穷无尽的力量。
          八尺宽公路
    出太原市向东北，我们走上一条宽阔的公路。越北的公路，大抵是崎岖不平的，这条公路却是意外的平坦。它越过丘陵，穿过山谷，伸进高山峻岭环抱着的平原，就像一条大河。
    这条公路，越北人谁都知道它，在越北住过的人谁都记得它。人们以骄傲的、亲切的心情，管它叫“八尺宽公路”。
    走在这条公路上，我们就想起素友的诗：
    我们在明朗的阳光下前进，
    我们轻快地从容地走在大路上，
    走在八尺宽的大路上。
    那是从北山、庭卡、通向太原的，
    那是经过西北的，那是上奠边府的，
    那是革命的路，它跟抗战一起成长。
      “它跟抗战一起成长”，这句话最恰当地回答了为什么人们总是那么亲切地说到这条公路。这条公路，原是一条普通的山区公路，既不宽阔，也不平坦。它的足以自豪的身躯是在抗战中茁壮起来的。这条路东起谅山中越边界，向西直达西北战场，由于战略需要，它逐渐加宽，多少人踩过它，多少越北民工的汗水滴在路面上。最后，为了支援奠边府战役，成千上万的民工们全力抢修，白天，当法国飞机来骚扰的时候，路面上没有一个人影，冷眼迎接法国空中强盗的，只有公路两旁严峻的高山和丛林；晚上，人们从山洞和树林里出来了，公路上是数不清的灯光和火把，就像滚动在黑夜里的一条看不见头尾的火龙。
    八尺宽公路完工后一星期，奠边府就解放了。
    这条历尽沧桑的公路，十多年来，曾经亲眼看见越南人民健儿怎样打退了日本帝国主义者的进攻，打退了法国殖民军一而再、再而三的向越北的窥犯；这条路上，曾经踏过八月总起义时候向南进军的脚步，曾经无数次响彻胜利的歌声；最后，也是这条公路，送走了回到河内、回到平原去的人们。
    这是一条胜利的公路。雄伟的高山和葱郁的森林都是它的见证。
      庭卡游击队根据地
    沿着这条八尺宽的公路，我们来到了离太原市四十公里的庭卡。
    庭卡，据越南朋友说，如果意译，就是“老区”。这里在一、二十年以前，就已经成为最初的革命根据地了。
    在公路旁停了汽车，涉过溪水，穿过灌木丛和稻田，我们来到山坳里一位侬族老大娘的家。按照侬族的习惯，我们一个个脱了鞋子，上了梯子，走进用竹子搭成的楼房。就在这里，我们会见了一些老游击队员们。他们之中，有当年游击队的领导人、现在担任越北自治区行政委员会委员的朱国兴同志，有1936年就参加革命活动、现在担任武崖县党委委员的朱移风同志，有从1933年就开始帮助革命活动的王文楼老大爷……。
    过去的日子去得远了，在那些丛山峻岭上留下的游击健儿们最初的足迹，也早已泯灭了，然而在这些老游击队员们的记忆里，却始终是那么新鲜。他们盘膝坐在楼板上的席子上，侃侃而谈，就像叙说昨天或者上星期发生的事一样。
    他们讲起党怎样在1933年就派干部来发动群众，组织对法国殖民者的斗争；在1940年北山起义时，又怎样组织武装的游击队进行配合。人们现在还常自豪地讲起，武崖游击队怎样在森林里同法国鬼子第一次交锋：敌人有三百多，包围了森林，游击队只有四个人，四支枪里有两支还是鸟枪。打响了不久，就进行了肉搏战。一下子，四个鬼子倒下了，其中一个是队长。敌人一看队长丧命，就纷纷退走了。
    法国殖民者包围住高山和森林，烧掉了整个整个村子，把老乡们都赶到集中营里，不许随便出入，上午八点开营门，下午四点关营门。切断了游击队同老乡们的联系，敌人以为这下子饿也要饿死游击队了。可是，被关在集中营的人，还是想出各种各样办法支持山上的英雄子弟，他们把粮食缝在衣服里，从集中营的篱笆里递给外面的人，再送到山里去；孩子到林子里去放牛，也在衣袋里装满了米；妇女出去挑水，竹筒里也装满了谷子。靠了这些粮食，游击队在山上就一直坚持下去。粮食吃完了，就吃野菜野果，吃竹笋过日子，有时候，好几个月没有盐吃。但是，这仍然没有挫折斗志。
    庭卡的游击队，就是这样地从无到有，从小到大。到1945年8月总起义以前，它已经发展成为一支大队伍了，它参加了解放越北许多地区的战斗；那时候，它已经不是星星之火，而是一股燎原烈焰了。
    向那位侬族老大娘告别后，我们又访问了两位土族和曼族游击队员的家。我们向他们表达了中国人民的问候和敬意。
    在深山坳里少数民族的家庭里，在那用竹板编成的壁上，我们同样可以看到毛主席的照片同胡志明主席、布尔加宁主席的照片并排挂着。在架上，那曾经无数次射击过敌人的枪，安静地躺着；刀和弓，仍然威武地挂在墙上。只要看一眼这些照片，这些枪、刀和弓箭，不用开口，主人和客人的心事就已经交融在一起了。
    越北自治区，英雄的土地！英雄的人民！
