Xinhua News Agency report: The People's Liberation Army's various services and arms of service achieved great results in their 1956 training work. In this year, the PLA's achievements in combat technical training surpassed those of previous years, especially in marksmanship, with the vast majority of units being rated "excellent" or "good" overall.

During the training process, the Communist Party committees and branches at all levels in the PLA actively played a leading role, implementing the mass line from top to bottom, and promoting the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of officers and soldiers. Many senior officers went deep into the companies, ships, or airfields, studying and training diligently with junior officers and soldiers. They also led the soldiers to promote military democracy, improve and enhance technology, acting as both teachers and students to the soldiers. A large-scale training upsurge swept the entire army. From the cold grasslands of Inner Mongolia to the scorching heat of Hainan Island, from the sky to the sea, officers and soldiers, under the call of "Improve Skills and Defend the Motherland," marched towards becoming "Excellent Marksmen" and "Technical Experts." In their diligent study and training, the broad masses of officers and soldiers put forward more rationalization proposals than in any previous year, solving many difficult problems in military training subjects and technical operations. At the same time, the officers and soldiers of various units also diligently carried out cultural and political studies, striving to become "both civil and military" national defense fighters.

After a year of diligent study and training, the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have significantly improved in military, political, and cultural aspects. The tactical and technical level of many established regiments and divisions has reached "excellent" or "good." Officers have generally improved their command skills and theoretical and cultural level. A large number of "Excellent Marksmen" and "Technical Experts" have emerged in various units. In a certain infantry unit's first company on the Fujian front, more than 89% of the soldiers were rated as first-class or second-class excellent marksmen. A certain naval patrol boat unit's overall training performance for the year was rated "good," with individual annual assessments all above four points, and the vast majority of personnel were rated as "technical experts." Many new recruits have made leapfrog progress under the leadership and help of officers and veteran soldiers. Chen Senqi, a new recruit in a reconnaissance company of a certain unit, was initially afraid of the turbulent sea. Later, in order to become a good scout, he stayed close to the sea day and night to learn to swim. Although the sun peeled his skin four or five layers, he drank a lot of bitter and salty seawater, and his hands and feet were pierced by oysters, he became more and more energetic as he practiced, and finally he could swim more than thirty li in one breath in the sea, and he also achieved excellent results in shooting. Wu Weixin, a new recruit in the fourth company of a certain artillery unit, in the six months after enlisting last year, in addition to skillfully mastering the operating skills of his "second gunner" position, also learned to master various other actions on a gun, becoming an "all-around gunner." Yu Yasun, a new sailor in a certain naval unit, not only became a first-class technical expert in one year of training, but also improved his cultural level from illiterate to graduating from elementary school.

    提高本领　保卫祖国
    1956年解放军练兵成绩很好
    新华社讯中国人民解放军各军种各兵种部队1956年度的练兵工作普遍取得很大成绩。这一年，全军在战斗技术训练方面的成绩超过往年，尤其是射击水平，全军绝大多数单位总评为“优秀”或“良好”。
    在练兵过程中，解放军中的中共各级委员会和支部积极发挥了领导作用，自上而下地贯彻群众路线，发扬了广大官兵的积极性和创造性。许多高级军官们深入连队、舰艇或飞机场上，同下级军官和士兵们一起勤学苦练，他们并领导士兵们发扬军事民主，改进和提高技术，做士兵的先生也当士兵的学生。全军掀起了大规模的练兵热潮。从寒冷的内蒙古草原到酷热的海南岛，从天空到海洋，官兵们在“提高本领，保卫祖国”的号召下，向“优等射手”和“技术能手”进军。广大官兵在勤学苦练中，提出了比过去任何一年都多的合理化建议，把许多军事训练课目和技术操作上的难题都解决了。同时，各部队的官兵们还刻苦地进行了文化、政治学习，努力争取做一个“文武双全”的国防军战士。
    中国人民解放军的官兵们经过一年的勤学苦练，在军事、政治和文化各方面的水平都有显著提高。许多整团整师的建制部队的战术、技术水平达到“优秀”或“良好”。军官们普遍提高了指挥才能和理论、文化水平。各部队涌现出大批的“优等射手”和“技术能手”。福建前线部队步兵某部第一连有89％以上的士兵被评为一级或二级优等射手。海军某巡逻艇全年的训练成绩总评“良好”，个人的年终考核都在四分以上，绝大部分人员被评为“技术能手”。许多新战士在军官和老战士的带领和帮助下，飞跃地进步。某部侦察连新战士陈森琪开始看见汹涌的大海就害怕，后来，他为了做一个好侦察兵，便黑白不离大海，学习游泳。虽然太阳把身上的皮肤晒退了四五层，喝了很多苦咸的海水，手脚也被海蛎子刺破了，但他越练越有劲，终于能在大海上一口气游泳三十多华里了，并且在射击方面也取得了优秀成绩。炮兵某部四连新战士吴惟信在去年应征入伍后的六个月中，除熟练地掌握了自己“二炮手”的操作技术以外，还学会掌握一门火炮上的其他各种动作，成为“全能炮手”。海军某部新水兵余亚笋在一年的练兵中不仅成为一级技术能手，并且把自己从文盲提高到高小毕业的文化水平。
