Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 16th: According to the Polish Press Agency, all parliamentary candidates in the three Warsaw constituencies met with voters on the 14th.

Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, members of the Warsaw Consultative Committee of Political Parties and Social Organizations, and others met with tens of thousands of Warsaw residents. Many representatives from factories, government offices, scientists, cultural workers, and youth attended the meeting.

The meeting was presided over by Stanisław Staszewski, Chairman of the Warsaw Consultative Committee of Political Parties and Social Organizations and First Secretary of the Warsaw Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party.

Gomułka delivered a lengthy speech at the meeting, which was warmly welcomed by the entire audience.

Those who also spoke at the meeting included: Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the United People's Party Wicech, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Democratic Party Hain, and Catholic leader and famous writer Zawieyski.

Wicech said that our main task is to pursue a policy serving the cause of peace, so that the country can work in peaceful conditions, eliminate the adverse consequences of the activities of the partitioners and the landlord-bourgeois government, as well as the losses of the Second World War and the Nazi occupation. Peace, like justice, must be striven for. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the power of the peace and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and the principles of relations between socialist countries defined in the Soviet declaration of October 30, 1956, are conducive to strengthening the forces of peace. We will strengthen our friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union and the people's democracies on the basis of these principles. We will combat any signs that violate these premises, because they are detrimental to the cause of peace and the vital interests of the Polish nation. Hain said: Some people think that October 1956 erased July 1944 from history. But it was July 1944 that was our starting point, and socialism is our goal.

Hain said that the Democratic Party believes that the future parliament should effectively combine the struggle for democracy and the struggle for a socialist Poland. We do not want to return to the bourgeois parliamentary system, that is, we do not want to return to a situation where the parliament becomes a venue for struggles between political parties.

After the meeting, an artistic performance was held.

    华沙选区候选人和选民会见
    新华社华沙16日电　据波兰通讯社讯：华沙三个选区的全部议员候选人14日和选民们会见。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡、华沙各政党和社会团体协商委员会的委员等会见了成千上万的华沙居民。到会的有工厂、机关的许多代表、科学家、文化工作者和青年。
    会见由华沙各政党和社会团体协商委员会主席、波兰统一工人党华沙委员会第一书记斯塔谢夫斯基主持。
    哥穆尔卡在会上发表了长篇演说，受到全场的热烈欢迎。
    在会上讲话的还有：波兰统一农民党中央委员会副主席维策赫、波兰民主党中央委员会总书记哈因和天主教领袖、著名作家扎维耶斯基。
    维策赫说，我们主要的任务是奉行为和平事业服务的政策，使国家能在和平条件下工作，消除瓜分国和地主资产阶级政府的活动所产生的恶劣后果以及第二次世界大战和纳粹占领的损失。和平和正义一样，是必须争取的。因此有必要加强以苏联为首的和平和社会主义阵营的力量。波兰统一工人党中央委员会第八次全体会议的决议和苏联1956年10月30日发表的宣言所确定的社会主义国家之间的关系的原则，是有利于加强和平力量的。我们将在这些原则的基础上加强我们同苏联和各人民民主国家的友好合作。我们将要打击违反这些前提的任何迹象，因为它们对于和平事业和波兰国家的切身利益都是有损害的。哈因说：有人认为1956年10月把1944年7月在历史上勾销了。但是正是1944年7月是我们的起点，而社会主义是我们的目标。
    哈因说，民主党认为，未来的议会应该把争取民主的斗争和争取社会主义的波兰的斗争有效地结合在一起。我们不希望回到资产阶级的议会制度，也就是不愿回到议会成为各政党之间斗争的场合的局面。
    会议结束后举行了艺术表演。
