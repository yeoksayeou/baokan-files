Xinhua News Agency, January 15th: According to a TASS report: At a joint meeting held on January 14th by the Supreme Soviet, Council of Ministers, and Communist Party Central Committee of the Kazakh Republic, Voroshilov awarded the Order of Lenin to the Kazakh Republic. Many advanced workers in industry, agriculture, and transportation attended the meeting.

Voroshilov congratulated the attendees and all the working people of Kazakhstan on behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Soviet government, and the Central Committee of the CPSU.

The Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR said that the reclamation of wasteland has drastically changed the face of Kazakhstan. While large-scale construction was being carried out in the rural areas of Kazakhstan, new industrial sectors were established within the Republic. The face of the cities is also constantly changing. He emphasized that only the Soviet state has the strength to carry out such large-scale land reclamation. The powerful movement of patriots from various brotherly republics volunteering to go to Kazakhstan for land reclamation particularly powerfully demonstrates the unbreakable and vibrant friendship of the peoples of the Soviet Union.

Voroshilov said that the friendly cooperation of the working people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union in building a great new society is not only for themselves but also for all mankind. Only insane people would imagine that they are already able to use bloody adventurous actions to divert one-third of humanity from the path of bright and fully attainable goals. No, these gentlemen are mistaken. The Soviet people are a united fraternal family. The people of the socialist camp, joined by the great China with its six hundred million people, now support this family. The peace camp fighting for truth, progress, and a happy future for mankind is invincible.

Voroshilov pointed out that after the failure of the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary and the attack on Egypt, the imperialists are now attempting to put new American-made shackles on the people of the Middle East and are launching a frenzied hostile propaganda campaign against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. All these conspiracies by the imperialist reactionaries have greatly complicated the international situation.

Voroshilov emphasized that the achievements of our economic construction are the best sobering agent for all instigators of war. The stronger our country is, the more guaranteed is a lasting and enduring peace.

Tashenev, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Kazakhstan, and Yakovlev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, also spoke.

On the same day, working people in the Republic's capital, Alma-Ata, held a mass rally to celebrate the Kazakh Republic's receipt of the Order of Lenin.

Kunaev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Kazakhstan, said at the meeting that the Kazakh Republic's receipt of the government's highest award – the Order of Lenin – will inspire all the working people of Kazakhstan to establish new labor feats.

Attendees warmly welcomed Voroshilov's speech. He said that Kazakhstan's achievements in land reclamation and grain delivery to the state are a great victory for the Republic and also a victory for the entire Soviet Union.

He pointed out that in the future we should continue to work selflessly to consolidate the prosperity and strength of our motherland and to meet the needs of the Soviet people. He said: The prosperity of the motherland is a reliable guarantee of world peace. The Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party are now, and should always be, a united and unbreakable force, so that no one dares to invade the peace-loving and hard-working people.

Xinhua News Agency, January 15th: According to TASS news: On January 14th, the workers of Tashkent, the capital of the Uzbek Republic, held a mass rally at the Tashkent Textile United Factory to celebrate Uzbekistan's receipt of the "Order of Lenin." About 10,000 people participated in the rally.

Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU and member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, as well as leaders of the Uzbek Communist Party and the Republic, participated in the rally.

Comrade Khrushchev spoke to the rally. He congratulated the Uzbek Republic on behalf of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government on receiving the Order of Lenin. His congratulations aroused warm applause in the venue, and the attendees cheered: "Hurray, the great Soviet people! Glory to our Communist Party!"

Comrade Khrushchev then briefly talked about the achievements of the Soviet Union's industrial and agricultural production in 1956 and the tasks proposed by the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU in December last year. He emphasized that the Soviet Union's grain production had made significant progress last year. However, we cannot be satisfied with this; we must further develop this agricultural sector, which is the foundation for the development of the entire agriculture and animal husbandry. The Soviet Union's milk production has also increased significantly, thus making it possible to supply residents of many cities with milk and dairy products uninterruptedly in the summer. Now, we should strive to ensure that the residents' demand for this food is fully met throughout the year.

In his speech, Khrushchev criticized serious shortcomings in the work of Soviet trade unions. He pointed out that trade unions often turn a blind eye to some fundamental issues of organizing production, fail to address the issue of properly arranging labor remuneration, and do not do enough to support the creativity and initiative of the working masses. He also emphasized the importance of production meetings in factories for the development of production. He said that without the active participation of the working masses, the factory director and his assistants alone cannot manage the enterprise well.

Khrushchev then talked about the problems in housing construction. He also pointed out that it is necessary to improve industrial and agricultural production and bring the various ministries and competent authorities closer to production.

Khrushchev finally talked about international issues. He said that the Soviet government has been fighting for world peace in the past and is still doing so now. The reduction of the Soviet armed forces, the Soviet Union's repeated proposals to ban atomic and hydrogen weapons, and other measures taken by the Soviet government are manifestations of our struggle. However, the imperialist countries, primarily the United States, not only do not accept our proposals, but they have also launched a frenzied arms race. This requires us to be vigilant and strengthen our armed forces. The Soviet government will continue to unswervingly implement the peace policy in the future, because this policy conforms to the fundamental interests of our people and all progressive humanity.

Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: According to TASS, Moscow: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR recently awarded the Kyrgyz and Turkmen Republics each with an Order of Lenin, and also awarded a large number of agricultural workers with medals, awards, and the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, in recognition of their significant achievements and outstanding results in developing agriculture. Last year, the Kyrgyz Republic purchased 395,000 tons more sugar beets from collective farms and state farms than in 1955. This Republic harvested 374 quintals of sugar beets per hectare. The state's cotton purchase plan was also overfulfilled, with a harvest of 20.7 quintals of cotton per hectare.

The cotton purchase volume of the Turkmen Republic last year reached 332,000 tons, which is 57,000 tons more cotton than was purchased in 1955.

    哈萨克共和国举行接受列宁勋章的会议
    伏罗希洛夫说强盛的苏联是和平的保证
    吉尔吉斯和土库曼两个共和国荣获列宁勋章
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社报道：在哈萨克共和国最高苏维埃、部长会议和共产党中央委员会1月14日举行的联席会议上，伏罗希洛夫把列宁勋章授予哈萨克共和国。许多工农业和运输业的先进工作者出席了这次会议。
    伏罗希洛夫在会上代表苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏联政府和苏共中央向到会者和哈萨克的全体劳动人民祝贺。
    这位苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席说，开垦荒地急剧地改变了哈萨克的面貌。在哈萨克农村进行大规模建设的同时，共和国内建立了新的工业部门。城市面貌也在不断改变。他强调指出，只有苏维埃国家才有力量进行这样大规模的垦荒工作。各兄弟共和国的爱国者为自愿去哈萨克垦荒而展开的强大运动，特别有力地表明了苏联各族人民牢不可破的、生气勃勃的友谊。
    伏罗希洛夫说，苏联各民族的劳动人民在伟大的新社会建设方面的友好合作，不仅是为了自己，而且也是为了全人类。只有丧失理智的人才这样幻想：他们已经能够用血腥的冒险行动使三分之一的人类离开光明的和完全可以达到的目标的道路。不，这些先生错了。苏联人民是一个统一的兄弟大家庭。有六亿人的伟大中国参加的社会主义阵营各国人民现在支持这个大家庭。为真理、进步和人类愉快的未来而斗争的和平阵营是不可战胜的。
    伏罗希洛夫指出：帝国主义者在策划匈牙利的反革命暴乱和向埃及的进攻失败以后，现在又企图把新的美国牌的枷锁套在中近东人民的脖子上，并且对苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家展开了猖狂的敌意宣传。帝国主义反动派这一切阴谋使国际局势大大复杂化了。
    伏罗希洛夫强调说，我们经济建设的成就对一切战争挑拨者来说是最好的清醒剂。我们国家越是强盛，巩固的持久和平越是有保证。
    哈萨克最高苏维埃主席团主席塔谢涅夫和哈萨克共产党中央委员会第一书记雅科夫列夫也讲了话。
    同一天，共和国首都阿拉木图的劳动人民举行群众大会庆祝哈萨克共和国荣获列宁勋章。
    哈萨克部长会议主席库纳耶夫在会上说，哈萨克今天荣获政府的最高奖赏——列宁勋章，这将鼓舞哈萨克全体劳动人民去建立新的劳动功勋。
    到会者热烈欢迎伏罗希洛夫的讲话。他说，哈萨克在开垦荒地和给国家缴纳粮食方面所取得的成就，是共和国的伟大胜利，也是全苏联的胜利。
    他指出，今后我们仍然应当为巩固我们祖国的繁荣和富强、为满足苏联人民的需求而忘我地劳动。他说：祖国的富强是世界和平的可靠保证。在共产党领导下的苏联人民现在是，而且应当永远是一支团结的牢不可破的力量，这样，才使得谁也不敢来侵犯爱和平的、爱劳动的人民。
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社消息：1月14日，乌兹别克共和国首都塔什干的劳动者在塔什干纺织联合工厂举行群众大会，庆祝乌兹别克荣获“列宁勋章”，参加大会的约有一万人。
    苏共中央第一书记、苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫、乌兹别克共产党和共和国国家领导人员参加了大会。
    赫鲁晓夫同志向大会讲了话。他代表苏共中央和苏联政府祝贺乌兹别克共和国荣获列宁勋章。他的祝贺引起了会场热烈的掌声，到会的人欢呼：“乌拉，伟大的苏联人民！光荣属于我们的共产党！”
    赫鲁晓夫同志接着简单地谈了1956年苏联工农业生产方面的成绩和苏共中央去年12月全体会议提出的任务。他强调指出，苏联的谷物生产在去年有了重大的发展。但是，不能满足于这一点，必须进一步发展作为整个农业和畜牧业发展基础的这一农业部门。苏联的牛奶生产也大大增加了，因而使得有可能在夏天毫不间断地为许多城市的居民供应牛奶和奶制品。现在应该争取保证充分满足居民全年对这种食品的需求。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中批评了苏联工会工作中的严重缺点。他指出，工会对一些组织生产的根本问题往往不闻不问，不去处理正确安排劳动报酬的问题，在支持工人群众的创造性、主动性方面也作得不够。他还强调指出了工厂中的生产者会议对发展生产的重要意义，他说，没有工人群众的积极参加，单是工厂厂长和他的助手是无法管理好企业的。
    赫鲁晓夫随后谈到了住宅建设中的问题。他还指出必须改进工农业生产，使各部和各主管机关接近生产。
    赫鲁晓夫最后谈到国际问题。他说，苏联政府过去和现在一直在为世界和平而奋斗，苏联武装部队的裁减，苏联一再提出的禁止原子武器、氢武器的建议以及苏联政府采取的其他一些措施就是我们进行这一斗争的表现。但是，帝国主义国家，首先是美国，非但不接受我们的建议，它们还展开了疯狂的扩充军备运动。这就要求我们提高警惕，加强我们的武装部队。苏联政府今后仍然要不屈不挠地执行和平政策，因为这一政策符合我国人民和全体进步人类的根本利益。
    据新华社13日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃主席团最近授给吉尔吉斯、土库曼共和国各一枚列宁勋章、并授给大批农业工作人员勋章、奖章和社会主义劳动英雄称号，以表彰他们在发展农业方面所获得的重大成就和出色的成绩。去年，吉尔吉斯共和国向集体农庄和国营农场征购的甜菜比1955年多三十九万五千吨。这个共和国的每一公顷土地收获了三百七十四公担甜菜。国家征购棉花的计划也超额完成了，每一公顷收获了二十点七公担棉花。
    土库曼共和国去年的棉花征购量达到了三十三万二千吨，比1955年所征购的棉花多五万七千吨。
