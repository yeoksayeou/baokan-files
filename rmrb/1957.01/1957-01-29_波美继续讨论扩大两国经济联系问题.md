Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 28th: According to a report by a reporter from the Polish newspaper "Warsaw Life," the Polish Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and head of the Polish delegation to the United Nations, Józef Winiewicz, held talks with US Deputy Secretary of State Robert Murphy on January 23rd to discuss the issue of expanding economic ties between Poland and the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, January 28th: Washington Dispatch: US President Eisenhower said on the 25th that the US government is taking "preparatory steps" to allow Poland to purchase US agricultural machinery and agricultural products on credit.

Eisenhower said this in a letter to Gordon, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In the letter, he said that the Polish government had expressed its willingness to purchase US cotton, wheat, fats and oils, fertilizers, agricultural machinery, and coal mining machinery.

A US State Department spokesman announced on the same day that the US would give "sympathetic consideration" to the Polish government's proposal to send an economic delegation to the United States to negotiate trade issues.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 28th: The Polish "People's Tribune" published a short commentary on the 27th regarding US President Eisenhower's statement on US-Polish economic relations on the 25th.

The commentary said that one of the basic principles of Poland's foreign policy is to strive to normalize and develop relations with all countries on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, and mutual benefit. Based on this, in a note to the US government on October 8th of last year, the Polish government expressed its willingness to begin negotiations with the US government in order to jointly consider all issues that could bring the Polish and American people closer together.

The commentary pointed out that normal economic cooperation and loans are conducive to the development of Poland's national economy. The US-Polish negotiations, which began in October of last year, have not yet yielded concrete results.

    波美继续讨论扩大两国经济联系问题
    新华社华沙28日电　据波兰“华沙生活报”记者报道，波兰外交部副部长兼波兰驻联合国代表团团长约瑟夫·维尼维奇在1月23日同美国副国务卿罗伯特·墨菲举行会谈，讨论了扩大波兰和美国之间的经济联系的问题。
    新华社28日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔25日说，美国政府正在采取“准备步骤”，让波兰以信贷方式来购买美国的农业机器和农产品。
    艾森豪威尔是在一封给众议院外交委员会主席戈登的信中说这些话的。他在信中说，波兰政府曾经表示愿意购买美国的棉花、小麦、脂肪和油类、肥料和农业机器与采煤机器。
    美国国务院发言人在同一天宣布，美国对波兰政府派遣一个经济代表团到美国谈判贸易问题的建议将给予“同情的考虑”。
    据新华社华沙28日电　波兰“人民论坛报”27日就美国总统艾森豪威尔25日关于美波经济关系的声明发表了一篇短评。
    短评说，波兰对外政策的基本原则之一，是努力使同一切国家的关系，在互相尊重主权、不干涉内政和互利的基础上得到正常化和发展。根据这一点，去年10月8日波兰政府在给美国政府的照会中曾经表示愿意同美国政府开始举行谈判，以便共同考虑一切能够使波美两国人民互相接近的问题。
    短评指出，正常的经济合作和贷款是有助于波兰国民经济的发展的。从去年10月开始的波美谈判，至今尚未取得具体结果。
