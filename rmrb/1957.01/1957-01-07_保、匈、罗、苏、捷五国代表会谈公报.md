Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 6th: Communiqué on the meeting of representatives of the Communist Parties, Workers' Parties, and governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia in Budapest. The full text is as follows:

At the invitation of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government and the leading organs of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, Comrade Zhivkov and Comrade Damyanov, representatives of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria; Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Comrade Moghioroș and Comrade Borilă, representatives of the Romanian Workers' Party and the Government of the Romanian People's Republic; Comrade Khrushchev and Comrade Malenkov, representatives of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Government; and Comrade Novotný and Comrade Široký, representatives of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic, arrived in Budapest on January 1st.

From January 1st to 4th, the representatives of the parties and governments of the aforementioned countries held talks, with the participation of: Comrade Zhivkov, Comrade Damyanov (Bulgaria), Comrade Kádár, Comrade Münnich (Hungary), Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Comrade Moghioroș, Comrade Borilă (Romania), Comrade Khrushchev, Comrade Malenkov (Soviet Union), Comrade Novotný, Comrade Široký (Czechoslovakia).

During the talks, the participants exchanged views on a series of political and economic issues of common concern, as well as on current issues in the international situation, in a comradely and friendly manner.

The participants exchanged information on their respective domestic and party situations.

Everyone noted with satisfaction that Bulgaria, Romania, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and all socialist countries have made new and significant achievements in the cause of socialist and communist construction. Hungary's national economy was also developing smoothly along the socialist path. However, this development was interrupted by the actions of counter-revolutionary forces. Now that the counter-revolution has been suppressed, Hungary's socialist economy is steadily progressing and continuously rising. In the past year, the countries of the socialist camp successfully completed their national economic plans, took a new step in improving the people's welfare, and made great progress in culture, science, and technology. The peoples of these countries, under the great banner of Marxism-Leninism, are more closely united around their Communist Parties, Workers' Parties, and governments.

All participants in the meeting reached a unanimous conclusion: the Hungarian working people, under the leadership of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government and with the help of the Soviet army, made efforts to prevent the conspiracy to destroy the people's democratic system and the socialist achievements of the Hungarian people. The threat of restoring fascist dictatorship in Hungary has been blocked, and the conspiracy of domestic counter-revolutionaries and foreign imperialist aggressor groups to turn Hungary into a dangerous source of new war in Europe has been thwarted. The attempt by the imperialist bloc to undermine the unity of the socialist camp has been resolutely repelled.

The representatives of the Communist Parties, Workers' Parties, and governments participating in this meeting expressed satisfaction with the increasingly normal political situation and economic life in Hungary. All healthy democratic forces in the country, led by the working class, are increasingly united around the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, supporting the government's and party's political and economic measures, and actively opposing the anti-people elements who, under the instructions of imperialist propaganda organs, are carrying out subversion and instigation activities among the residents. The Hungarian peasants did not listen to the instigation of counter-revolutionary and imperialist propaganda; they live a normal working life and repelled the attempt to restore the former landlord order in the Hungarian countryside. That part of the Hungarian working people who had been deceived by the counter-revolutionary, inflammatory and provocative nationalist slogans have become increasingly convinced that they have been deceived. They now recognize that such deception and counter-revolutionary activities have cost the Hungarian people many outstanding sons and daughters who sacrificed themselves under the terror of the counter-revolutionary bandits. The Hungarian working people are increasingly aware of the harm of the path forced upon them by the forces hostile to the people's democratic system and the socialist cause.

The Hungarian working class, peasants, and intellectuals now correctly assess the domestic situation and the tasks facing the Hungarian people and the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government. The Hungarian working people increasingly understand that only by developing production, restoring normal economic life in the country, developing the national economy, increasing labor productivity in industry and agriculture, reducing product costs, and accumulating funds can we ensure the improvement of people's welfare and the consolidation of a people's democratic Hungary.

During the exchange of views, the meeting participants pointed out that Hungarian Communists are more closely uniting their ranks and are making every effort to consolidate Hungary's people's democratic system and strengthen socialist construction, and to develop solid friendly relations with all socialist camp countries.

The representatives of Bulgaria, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia assured the Hungarian comrades that the people of their countries will fully support and assist the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party in strengthening the people's democratic state, ensuring the country's independence and security, and guarding against the conspiracies of the imperialist aggressor forces.

The participants in the meeting exchanged views on the declaration issued by the Soviet Union on October 30, 1956, and expressed their unanimous conviction that this declaration by the Soviet government fully accords with the interests of strengthening the friendly relations between socialist countries on the basis of adhering to the Leninist principles of equality, respect for the interests of all peoples, non-interference in internal affairs, and proletarian internationalism.

The representatives of these countries noted with satisfaction that the provisions of this declaration are being implemented in practice in the relations between socialist countries, which helps to further unite the socialist camp, further develop socialist economic and cultural construction in various countries, and helps to strengthen the friendship between the peoples of these countries and develop their fraternal mutual assistance. After exchanging views on current issues in the international situation, the participants in the meeting pointed out that the recent international situation has obviously become tense, which is caused by the actions of the Western countries' aggressive blocs who want to push the world back into the "Cold War". The aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel, and the actions of the imperialist blocs in Hungary have proved this.

The actions of the United States are also making the international situation tense, as it is stepping up its activities to enslave the countries of the Near East and Middle East. The so-called "Eisenhower-Dulles Doctrine" is a manifestation of this colonialist intention. The fundamental part of this "doctrine" is that the U.S. President has special powers to use U.S. armed forces in the Near East and Middle East according to his own considerations. The crude interference of U.S. monopoly capital and its military blocs in the affairs of the countries in the Near East and Middle East will seriously worsen the situation in this region, which not long ago became a battlefield due to the invasion of Egypt.

In this situation, the United States must bear full responsibility for the tension in the Near East and Middle East situation and all the consequences arising therefrom. In the interests of the people of the Near East and Middle East and in order to safeguard peace and tranquility in the region, all countries are required to work to eliminate the consequences of the aggression against Egypt and to never allow any external forces to interfere in the affairs of the countries of the Near East and Middle East or undermine their sovereignty and independence.

The socialist countries have always consistently upheld the cause of peace among the peoples of all countries, and they are doing everything possible to prevent the restoration of the "Cold War". They are fully determined to use the strength of the socialist system and their own influence to crush the attempts of the aggressive blocs to further intensify the international situation, step up arms expansion, and incite war hysteria. They firmly believe that the possibility of improving international relations and ensuring the real security of the peoples of all countries has not been exhausted by far. Under the current conditions, taking practical steps to reduce the armaments and armed forces of various countries and banning dangerous weapons of mass destruction such as atomic and hydrogen weapons is of great significance. Establishing a collective security system in Europe is in the interests of the security of all European peoples and the peoples of the whole world.

The participants in the meeting firmly believe that all socialist countries will unite more closely, will defend their unbreakable unity, and will repel all attempts to shake and weaken the socialist camp.

    保、匈、罗、苏、捷五国代表会谈公报
    全力支援匈牙利，保证它的独立和安全。苏联在1956年10月30日宣言中的条款正在实践中得到贯彻，这就有助于进一步团结社会主义阵营，发展兄弟般互助。　西方国家侵略集团想恢复“冷战”，美国大肆活动以图奴役近东、中东。　社会主义国家坚信裁军、禁止原子武器和建立欧洲集体安全体系，符合世界人民安全的利益。
    新华社布达佩斯6日电　关于保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、苏联和捷克斯洛伐克的共产党、工人党和政府的代表在布达佩斯会谈的公报。全文如下：
    保加利亚共产党和保加利亚人民共和国政府代表日夫科夫同志、达米扬诺夫同志，罗马尼亚工人党和罗马尼亚人民共和国政府代表乔治乌—德治同志、莫吉奥罗希同志和波里勒同志，苏联共产党和苏联政府代表赫鲁晓夫同志、马林科夫同志以及捷克斯洛伐克共产党和捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表诺沃提尼同志和西罗基同志应匈牙利工农革命政府和匈牙利社会主义工人党领导机关的邀请，于1月1日到达布达佩斯。
    从1月1日到4日，上述国家党和政府的代表举行了会谈，参加会谈的有：日夫科夫同志、达米扬诺夫同志（保加利亚），卡达尔同志、明尼赫同志（匈牙利），乔治乌—德治同志、莫吉奥罗希同志、波里勒同志（罗马尼亚），赫鲁晓夫同志、马林科夫同志（苏联），诺沃提尼同志、西罗基同志（捷克斯洛伐克）。
    在会谈中，大家就共同关心的一系列政治和经济性质的问题，以及国际局势中当前的一些问题，以同志和友好的态度交换了意见。
    会谈的参加者彼此就自己的国内和党内的情况交换了情报。
    大家满意地指出，保加利亚、罗马尼亚、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克以及一切社会主义国家在社会主义和共产主义的建设事业中取得了新的巨大成就。匈牙利的国民经济本来也在沿着社会主义道路顺利发展。但是，这种发展被反革命势力的行动打断了。现在，当反革命被镇压以后，匈牙利的社会主义经济已经在稳步进展并且不断高涨。在过去一年中，社会主义阵营国家胜利地完成了国民经济计划，在改善人民福利方面迈进了新的一步，文化、科学和技术有了很大的发展。这些国家的人民在伟大的马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，更加紧密地团结在自己的共产党、工人党和政府的周围。
    这次会谈的全体参加者得出了一个一致的意见：匈牙利劳动人民在匈牙利工农革命政府的领导下，依靠着苏联军队的帮助，进行努力，防止了想要摧毁人民民主制度和匈牙利人民社会主义成果的阴谋。在匈牙利恢复法西斯专政的威胁已经被阻挡住了，国内反革命和国外帝国主义侵略集团想把匈牙利变成欧洲新战争的危险策源地的阴谋已经被挫败了。帝国主义集团想破坏社会主义阵营的团结的企图遭到了坚决的反击。
    参加这次会谈的共产党、工人党和政府的代表们对匈牙利的政治情况和经济生活的日趋正常表示满意。以工人阶级为首的国内一切健康的民主力量越来越团结在匈牙利工农革命政府和匈牙利社会主义工人党的周围，支持政府和党的政治、经济措施，积极反对奉帝国主义宣传机构的指示在居民中进行颠覆、挑拨活动的反人民分子。匈牙利农民没有听信反革命的和帝国主义宣传的挑拨，他们过着正常的劳动生活，击退了有人想在匈牙利农村恢复以前的大地主秩序的企图。曾被反革命的煽惑人心的、挑拨性的民族主义口号所欺骗的那一部分匈牙利劳动人民，已经越来越相信他们是受了骗，他们现在认识到这种欺骗和反革命活动使匈牙利人民的许多优秀子弟付出了血的代价，他们在反革命匪帮恐怖之下牺牲了。匈牙利劳动人民越来越意识到敌视人民民主制度和社会主义事业的势力强迫他们走的那条道路的危害性。
    匈牙利的工人阶级、农民和知识分子，现在都正确地估计到国内局势以及匈牙利人民和工农革命政府所面临的任务。匈牙利劳动人民日益理解到，只有发展生产，恢复国内正常的经济生活，发展国民经济，提高工农业劳动生产率，减低产品成本和积累资金，才能保证提高人民福利和巩固人民民主的匈牙利。
    在交换意见的时候，会谈参加者指出，匈牙利共产党人正在更紧密地团结自己的队伍，并且竭尽全力来巩固匈牙利的人民民主制度和加强社会主义的建设，发展同所有社会主义阵营国家的巩固的友好关系。
    保加利亚、罗马尼亚、苏联和捷克斯洛伐克的代表向匈牙利同志保证，他们国家的人民将全力支持和援助匈牙利工农革命政府和匈牙利社会主义工人党来加强人民民主国家，保证这个国家的独立和安全，以防备帝国主义侵略势力的阴谋。
    会谈参加者就苏联在1956年10月30日发表的宣言交换了意见，并且表示一致深信，苏联政府这个宣言完全符合在遵守平等、尊重各国人民利益、不干涉内政的列宁主义原则和无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上加强社会主义国家之间的友好关系的利益。
    这些国家的代表们满意地指出，这个宣言中的条款正在社会主义国家互相关系的实践中得到贯彻，这就有助于进一步团结社会主义阵营，进一步发展社会主义各国经济建设和文化建设，有助于加强这些国家人民之间的友谊和发展他们的兄弟互助。会谈的参加者就国际局势中的当前问题交换意见后指出，最近的国际局势显然紧张起来了，这是想把世界重新推向“冷战”的西方国家侵略集团的行动所引起的。英、法、以色列三国的侵略埃及和帝国主义集团在匈牙利的行动都证明了这一点。
    美国的行动也在使国际局势紧张起来，它又在大肆活动以图奴役近东、中东国家。所谓“艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯主义”就是这种殖民主义意图的表现。这个“主义”的根本部分是，美国总统有特别权力来根据自己的考虑在近东、中东使用美国武装部队。美国垄断资本和它的军事集团对近东、中东国家的事务的粗暴干涉，会使不久前因埃及被侵略而成为战场的这一地区的情况再度严重恶化。
    在这种情况下，美国要对近东、中东局势的紧张以及由此而产生的一切后果负全部责任。为了近、中东人民的利益以及为了维护这一地区的和平和安宁，就要求各个国家都致力于消除侵略埃及的后果，决不允许任何外力干涉近东、中东国家的事务或损害它们的主权和独立。
    社会主义国家始终一贯地维护各国人民间的和平事业，它们在尽全力阻止“冷战”的恢复。它们有充分决心要利用社会主义制度的力量和自己的影响，来粉碎侵略集团想使国际局势进一步紧张、加紧扩充军备、煽动战争狂热的企图。它们坚信，改善国际关系以及保证各国人民真正安全的可能性还远没有用尽。在目前条件下，采取实际的步骤裁减各国军备和武装部队、禁止原子武器和氢武器之类危险的毁灭性武器，有重大的意义。如果在欧洲建立集体安全体系，这是符合全欧洲人民和全世界人民的安全的利益的。
    会谈的参加者坚信，所有的社会主义国家将更紧密地团结起来，将要捍卫它们牢不可破的团结，击退一切想动摇和削弱社会主义阵营的尝试。
