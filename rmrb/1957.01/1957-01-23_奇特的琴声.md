    Peculiar Sounds of the Qin
    Lu Qiming
    The sky was gradually darkening. After a day of sailing and intense operations, the sailors were all somewhat tired and were now resting. Some were chatting on the foredeck, others were strolling on the port and starboard decks. I was playing "pass the towel" with a group of sailors on the aft deck and was having a great time when suddenly an elegant and melodious sound of a qin came from the signal station.
    "Huh, strange!" I thought, "I'm not bragging, I've been to Shanghai, Nanjing, and lived in Beijing for over a month. I've seen many plays and listened to no fewer than ten concerts, but I've never heard this kind of qin sound!" I disregarded the game and ran to the signal station. Climbing up to the signal station, I saw many people gathered around a machinist named Qin Tiangui. I recognized him; the political commissar had introduced him to me, saying he was a good sailor who loved to sing, dance, and was passionate about machinery. I approached Qin Tiangui and saw, good heavens, what could he call that thing he was holding! It was an erhu bow and the hacksaw I had used when I saw him working in the engine room during the day. This hacksaw was about two feet long, with a wider end at the handle and a narrower end. Qin Tiangui was moving the bow back and forth on the back of the hacksaw. From his movements, I could see that he was using the up and down motion of the bow and the twisting motion of the hacksaw to emit rhythmic notes.
    "Play 'Meeting at the Pavilion'!" someone suggested. Immediately, the beautiful Yue opera melody attracted all the audience.
    I felt very strange: "How did he discover that a hacksaw could also be used as a musical instrument?" As the engine room squad leader walked over, I went up to ask him. He told me: Qin Tiangui joined the ship in 1952. He's a Youth League member, very active in his work. Whether it's before sailing, after sailing, or during sailing, he always checks the machinery repeatedly. Once, a screw on a machine broke, and he immediately started making a screw himself. The original iron bar was a foot long, but the screw only needed to be two inches. He sawed and sawed, and after a long time, his hands became sore, and the hacksaw also didn't pull straight and the hacksaw emitted several different sounds, he felt very strange, but at that time he didn't have time to think about these, and quickly made the screw. Another time, another important part on the machine broke, and they were going to sail early the next morning, he thought: "In any case, it must be repaired tonight, so as not to affect the ship's voyage and the sailors' training!" That night, he and two other machinists didn't close their eyes. The original blank of this part was too big, so of course he had to saw it with a hacksaw. Because the task was urgent, he sawed hard. Strange, the sounds emitted by the hacksaw became more and more and bigger. At that time, he didn't think about it. This part was completed by the three of them in the night at three o'clock—two hours before the sailing time. They were praised and rewarded. In this way, in more than four years of hard work, Qin Tiangui discovered that the hacksaw could emit many kinds of pleasant sounds, so he bought a bow from an erhu to experiment with, and later asked comrades who could play the erhu to match the notes. At first, he found that many notes were similar to the erhu, and after several experiments, and matching the sound with the erhu, he finally discovered that the hacksaw could emit every note on the musical score, and thus he learned the skill of playing with a hacksaw.
    "This was discovered from labor, so the melody played is even more beautiful and moving!" the sergeant squad leader said excitedly and proudly.
    "Well played!" A shout suddenly came from the sea surface on the starboard side, followed by applause. I turned to look and saw that it was praise from two passing fishing boats.

    奇特的琴声
    陆其明
    天慢慢地暗了下来，水兵们经过一天的航行和紧张的操作，大家都有些累了，现在正在休息。有的在前甲板上聊天，有的在左右两舷的甲板上散步。我和一群水兵在后甲板上做“传手巾”的游戏，正玩得高兴，突然从信号台上传来一种优雅悦耳的琴声。
    “咦，奇怪！”我心想，“我不是吹牛，我到过上海、南京，也在北京住过一个来月，看了很多戏，听了不下十次的音乐会，但就是没有听到过这种琴声！”我顾不得做游戏，起身就往信号台上跑。爬上信号台，只见许多人围着一个轮机兵秦天贵。这人我认识他，政委向我介绍过，说他是个爱唱爱跳、热爱轮机的好水兵。我凑近秦天贵一看，天哪，他手里拿的算是什么琴！那是二胡上的一把弓子和我白天在机舱里看他工作的时候用过的钢锯。这钢锯两尺来长，有柄的一端宽，另一头窄些，秦天贵用弓子在钢锯的背部来回地拉着。从他的动作中，我看出，他是利用弓子上下的移动，和钢锯的曲折运动，发出有节奏的音符来的。
    “拉一个‘楼台会’吧！”有人提议。于是优美的越剧曲调，立即吸引了所有观众。
    我感到很奇怪：“他怎么发现钢锯也能当乐器呢？”轮机班长刚走来，我就上前去问他，他告诉我：秦天贵是1952年上舰的，青年团员，工作挺积极，不管在航行前，航行后，或是在航行中，他总是三番五次地检查机器。有一次，一个机器上的一个螺丝断了，他马上动手自己做螺丝。一根原坯铁条有一尺长，而这个螺丝却只要二寸就够了。他用钢锯锯，锯呀锯呀，时间久了，手发酸了，钢锯也拉不直了，钢锯发出几种不同的声音，他感到很奇怪，但当时他也没有时间去想这些，很快地把螺丝做好了。又一次，机器上的另一个重要零件坏了，第二天一早就要出航，他想：“无论如何也得在今晚抢修出来，不能影响军舰的航行和水兵们的训练！”这一夜他和另外两个轮机兵没有合一下眼。这一个零件原坯太大，他当然又要用钢锯锯，因任务急，锯得猛，奇怪，钢锯发出的声音就越多越大，当时他也没有去考虑它。这个零件在他们三人抢修下，在夜里三点——距开航行时间还有两小时，提前完成了，他们受到了表扬和奖励。就这样，秦天贵在四年多来辛勤的工作中，发现了钢锯可以发出好多种悦耳的声音，他就买来了一把二胡上的弓子试验，后来又请会拉二胡的同志对音符。开始发现许多音符和二胡相似，又经过几次试验，和二胡配音，终于发现了钢锯能发出乐谱上的每一个音符，就这样他学会了用钢锯演奏的技能。
    “这是从劳动中发现的，所以奏出来的曲调更优美动听！”上士班长兴奋而自豪地说。
    “奏得好！”突然从右舷海面上传过来喊声，接着是鼓掌声。我侧身一看，原来这是从两条过路的渔船上发出来的赞美声。
