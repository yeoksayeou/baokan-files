    In the previous period, the names of literary periodicals in various regions were uniformly formed by adding the two characters "文艺" (Wenyi, meaning literature and art) after the place name, such as "某地文艺" (Wenyi of a Certain Place). Some people said that this was like the popular cadre uniform, which made it difficult to distinguish between men and women, and was a manifestation of the generalization and lack of unique style of many literary periodicals.
    As a result, many periodicals changed their names one after another, and new periodicals of course wanted to come up with a good-sounding name, such as "Grassland," "Outpost," "Stars," "Rain Flower," and so on. The Shenyang Branch of the Writers Association even solicited magazine names from readers at a high price, and as a result, selected the three characters "处女地" (Chunvdi, meaning Virgin Land).
    I also agree that literary periodicals should have a beautiful name. But the quality of a periodical is ultimately determined by its content. One comrade criticized "Script" and "Songs," saying that the names of these two periodicals were too "simple." If you name your children according to this method, then it would be called Boy, Girl; Second Boy, Second Girl... I think children cannot be directly called Boy or Girl, because everyone calls them that way, it will be confusing. But there is nothing wrong with a periodical being named according to its content or nature. Throughout history, both in China and abroad, there are many periodicals named in this way that are loved by readers, such as China's "Fiction Monthly," "Literature," and "Translation," which was founded by Mr. Lu Xun in his early years and is still published today. The Soviet Union's "Literary Gazette" is a continuation of the periodical of the same name founded by Pushkin. The names of these periodicals are "simply" and directly calling out their content, so what's wrong with that?
    It is of course very good for a periodical to have a good name. But what can truly win over readers is relying on its solid content, not on a beautiful name. Belinsky and Lu Xun were both experts in editing periodicals, and the periodicals they edited were always supported by the broad masses of readers. I think the most important thing is that their periodicals always keenly reflected the advanced ideas and demands of that era. What they advocated and what they opposed were clearly defined, and the broad masses of readers gained fighting strength and confidence from them. This is the soul of a periodical. Without this, even if the name is beautiful and pleasant to hear, it is useless, let alone a unique style. Unfortunately, some of our literary periodicals lack this. I cannot help but suspect that if the editor of a periodical even asks readers to come up with the name of the periodical, then does the editor himself have a "bottom line" in his heart regarding the clear proposition and unique style that the periodical should have?

    前一个时期，各地文艺刊物的名称，一律是在地名之下加上文艺两个字，叫做某地文艺。有人说这就像流行的干部服一样，穿起来男女不分，是许多文艺刊物一般化、缺乏自己的独特风格的一种表现。
    于是，许多刊物群起改名，新出的刊物当然更要起一个好听的名字，如“草地”、“前哨”、“星星”、“雨花”等等。作家协会沈阳分会出版的“文学月刊”还向读者重价征求刊名，结果选中了“处女地”三个字。
    我也赞成文艺刊物有一个漂亮的名字。但刊物的好坏，毕竟还是决定于内容。有一位同志指责“剧本”、“歌曲”，说这两个刊物的名称太“朴素”了，如果按此法为自己的孩子起名，那就叫男孩，女孩；第二个男孩，第二个女孩……。我觉得，孩子不能直叫男孩或女孩，因为大家都那样叫，就要混淆不清。但刊物根据它的内容或性质来命名是没有什么不可以的。古今中外，这样起名而为读者所喜爱的刊物多得很，如我国的“小说月报”、“文学”，如今天还在出版的早年由鲁迅先生创办的“译文”。苏联的“文学报”，是继承普希金所创办的同名刊物的。这些刊物的名称都是“朴素”地直呼其内容的，又有什么不好呢？
    刊物有一个好名称，当然很好。但真正能够取得读者的，是依靠自己的结实的内容，而不是依靠一个漂亮的名字。别林斯基、鲁迅都是编刊物的能手，他们所编的刊物，总是得到广大读者的拥护。我觉得，最主要的，是因为他们的刊物总是敏锐地反映了那个时代的先进的思想和要求，它们主张什么，反对什么，是旗帜鲜明的，广大读者从它们那里得到战斗的力量和信心。这是刊物的灵魂。没有这个，那怕名称再漂亮再动听也是没有用处的，当然更谈不到什么独创的风格。可惜我们的一些文艺刊物正是缺乏这个。我不能不怀疑，一个刊物的编者如果连自己所编的刊物的名称都要请读者代想，那末对于刊物所应该具有的鲜明的主张和独特的风格，编者自己心中有没有“底”呢？
