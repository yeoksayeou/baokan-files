Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 15th: Workers at the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory are advancing continuously on the road of diligence and thrift by exploiting the potential of their old equipment.

This factory was built in 1903. Ninety-five percent of the machine tools in the factory are old, having been in use for twenty to fifty years. Because the workers pay attention to maintenance and use advanced jigs, tools, and make partial improvements on these old machines, the potential of the old equipment is continuously being realized. Hu Baoyuan, an old worker in the mechanical processing workshop, uses a machine tool that has been used for more than fifty years. The heavy tool holder has low production efficiency and wastes manpower. Each time he makes a three-meter-long lead screw, he has to add a handyman to help him shake the tool holder. Recently, he and electrician Wang Yusheng studied installing a small motor on the tool holder to automate the movement of the tool holder. In this way, the time for one stroke of the tool holder is shortened from three minutes to just over ten seconds. Hu Baoyuan has worked on this machine tool for eight years. He said: As long as we pay attention to maintenance, this machine can still produce well. Using new technologies on old equipment is what workers are most concerned about. Now, more than sixty people in this workshop are using four or five kinds of advanced jigs.

In the locomotive boiler repair workshop, the rational use of materials has become common practice among the workers. In the first eight days of January this year, Zhang Fengfu, a worker in the axle box work area, used old axle tiles of qualified quality to replace fourteen new axle tiles, saving the equivalent value of fifteen taels of gold. In the past, regardless of the quality of the original axle tiles, the repair regulations stipulated that all locomotives sent to the factory for repair had to be replaced with new ones. This practice made experienced old workers feel very sorry. They suggested that good quality old axle tiles should be used. After identification by technicians, it was proved that the quality of many old axle tiles met the repair standards.

In October last year, the workers themselves used old carriages to build a workshop for using waste materials. This year, this workshop plans to utilize 80% of the old wood removed from each vehicle, of which 60% will be used for repairing vehicles; 100 kilograms of old iron pins removed from vehicles will be repaired every month and supplied to the factory's capital construction department. They also supply waste steel to the sand casting workshop or make various accessories for use in various workshops. The work clothes worn out by the factory's workers and the gloves that are broken are also collected by the workers in this workshop, disassembled, washed, and then pieced together and sewed into sets.

### 在勤俭的道路上前进  哈尔滨机车车辆修理厂发挥旧设备的潜力

    在勤俭的道路上前进
    哈尔滨机车车辆修理厂发挥旧设备的潜力
    据新华社哈尔滨15日电　哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂职工，发挥陈旧设备的潜力，在勤俭的道路上不断前进。
    这个工厂是1903年建成的。工厂里95％的机床是用过二十年到五十年的老旧机床。由于工人注意保养维护，并且在这些旧机器上使用了先进的胎具、刀具和作了部分的改进，使老旧设备的潜力不断得到发挥。机械加工车间老工人胡宝元使用着一台用过五十多年的机床，笨重的刀架生产效率既低，又浪费人力，每次做三公尺长的丝杠，都要增加一个杂工帮他摇动刀架。最近他和电工王雨生研究在刀架上安装一个小电动机，使刀架的来往变成自动的。这样，刀架来往一次的时间由三分钟缩短到十几秒钟。胡宝元在这台机床上工作了八年，他说：只要注意保养，这台机器还能很好地生产。在旧设备上利用新技术是工人们最关心的事。现在，这个车间有六十多人使用着四、五种先进的胎具。
    在检修机车锅炉的车间里，合理地使用材料，已经在职工中形成风气。今年1月份的头八天中，轴箱工区工人张凤福利用质量合格的旧轴瓦代替了十四块新轴瓦，节省的价值等于十五两黄金。过去进厂检修的机车，不管原来的轴瓦质量好坏，检修规程规定一律要重换新的。这种作法使有经验的老工人感到很痛惜，他们建议应该利用质量好的旧轴瓦。经过技术人员的鉴定，证明很多旧轴瓦的质量合乎检修标准。
    去年10月，职工们自己动手利用旧车厢修成一个利用废料的车间。今年，这个车间计划把每辆车拆下来的旧木材利用80％，其中有60％要用来修车；车辆中拆卸下来的旧铁针，每月要修好一百公斤，供给厂的基本建设部门使用。他们还把废钢铁供应翻砂车间，或制成各种配件供各车间使用。全厂工人穿破的作业服和用坏的手套，这个车间的职工也都搜集回来，拆洗以后再拼凑缝补成套。
