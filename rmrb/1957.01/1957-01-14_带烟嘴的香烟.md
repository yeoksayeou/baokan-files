    Cigarettes with Mouthpieces
    Recently, cigarettes with mouthpieces produced by the Harbin Cigarette Factory have appeared on the Harbin market.
    One type, called "Yun Ge" (Cloud Pigeon) brand, is slightly longer than ordinary cigarettes. The majority of each cigarette is filled with tobacco, while the other half is a paper tube made of slightly stiffer paper. Smokers can smoke all the tobacco, thus avoiding wasting the butt. According to the factory's estimate, this can save one-third of the tobacco leaves compared to ordinary cigarettes. Another type, a specially made flattened "Harbin" brand cigarette, has a piece of birch bark glued to one end of each cigarette. When held in the mouth, it doesn't get wet from saliva and doesn't stick to the lips, which is very popular with customers. (Xinhua News Agency)

    带烟嘴的香烟
    最近在哈尔滨市场上出现了由哈尔滨卷烟厂生产的带烟嘴的香烟。
    其中有一种叫“云鸽”牌的香烟，比一般香烟稍长一些，每支烟一大半卷有烟丝，另一半是用略硬的纸卷成的纸管，吸烟的人可以把烟丝全部吸完。这样就避免了烟头的浪费。据这个厂的估计，可以比一般香烟节约三分之一的烟叶。另一种压成扁形的特制“哈尔滨”牌香烟，在每支烟的一头粘有一块桦树皮，衔在嘴里浸水不湿，而且不粘嘴唇，很受顾客欢迎。（新华社）
