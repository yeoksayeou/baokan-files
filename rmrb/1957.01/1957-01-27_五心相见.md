    "Meeting with Five Hearts"
    Du Lijun
    On page 3 of the People's Daily, November 17, 1956, I read a thought-provoking piece of news:
    Since over five hundred agricultural cooperatives in Jurong County, Jiangsu Province, began studying "democratic cooperative management," the work style of the vast majority of cadres has changed, and the unity between cadres and members has been strengthened. Some agricultural cooperative cadres proposed to meet the members with "five hearts" – treat members with enthusiasm, patiently persuade and educate, carefully handle cooperative affairs, be determined to overcome shortcomings, and wholeheartedly serve the members.
    Well said! I think that for cadres in any work position, this "meeting with five hearts" is of great practical significance.
    Aren't there such leading cadres? They are not enthusiastic about the masses, not patient when persuading the masses, not careful when carrying out work, lack the determination to correct their shortcomings, and serve the masses half-heartedly. Some leading cadres are even dictatorial and domineering, lording it over others, suppressing criticism, and behaving like "officials." In this way, an invisible wall is built between leading cadres and the masses.
    If you don't love the masses, the masses won't love you. If you don't give your "heart" to the masses, the masses will never give their "heart" to you. Indeed, it is necessary to exchange "heart" for "heart," heart to
                    heart.
    That invisible wall is a terrible wall, a dangerous wall.
    When this wall falls, "meeting with five hearts"!

    “五心相见”
    杜黎均
    在1956年11月17日人民日报第三版上，我读到一段耐人寻味的消息：
    江苏省句容县五百多个农业社自开始学习“民主办社”以来，绝大多数干部的工作作风有了转变，干部和社员之间的团结加强了。有的农业社干部提出同社员“五心相见”——热心对待社员，耐心说服教育，细心处理社务，决心克服缺点，全心全意为社员服务。
    提得好！我觉得对于任何工作岗位上的干部说来，这个“五心相见”都是极有现实意义的。
    不是有这样的领导干部吗？对待群众不热心，说服群众时不耐心，进行工作时不细心，改正自己的缺点时无决心，为群众服务是三心二意，半心半意。有的领导干部甚至独断专横，作威作福，压制批评，“官”气凌人。这样，领导干部和群众之间也就筑起了一座无形的墙。
    你不热爱群众，群众就不会热爱你。你不把你的“心”给群众，群众就永远不会把“心”交给你。的确，需要以“心”换“心”，心
                    心相印。
    那座无形的墙，是可怕的墙，危险的墙。
    此墙一倒，“五心相见”！
