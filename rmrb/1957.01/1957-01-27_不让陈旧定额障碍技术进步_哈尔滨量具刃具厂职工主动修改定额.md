Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 26th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Ruogang): Workers at the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant who are on piece-rate wages actively proposed reducing work-hour norms during the discussion of this year's work-hour norms; 95% of them did so.

After the factory went into production, labor productivity increased step by step. In the third quarter of last year, labor productivity increased by 31.9% compared to the first quarter, and workers' piece-rate wages exceeded their base wages by more than 38.3%. Therefore, many workers felt that the original obsolete norms were unreasonable.

The screw grinder team in the tool workshop was the first to raise the opinion of reducing work-hour norms. The team leader, ? Qingchen, due to mastering the grinder technology and improving production efficiency, completed two months' worth of tasks in one month of September last year. In October, he received a salary of more than 160 yuan. The third-grade workers who worked with him in shifts also earned about the same. The team workers felt that such work-hour norms were too unreasonable. For example, when making grinding tools, the work-hour norm for each grinding tool was 20 minutes, but the whole team could only make a maximum of 40 per shift, averaging only 12 minutes each; ? Qingchen could make a maximum of 80. Thus, his workload per shift (eight hours) was equivalent to more than three days of work. After comparing the original work-hour norms with the actual production capacity, the team's workers believed that the work-hour norms for 420 out of 441 products needed to be reduced.

During the factory-wide revision of work-hour norms, the work-hour norms of the micrometer section of the measuring tool workshop were not yet due for revision (according to regulations, they are revised every six months; this group had only revised them three months ago), but this group had already exceeded the norm by 50% in the past three months of executing the new norms for the planing work of micrometer frames. Therefore, they also wanted to reduce this work-hour norm from 24 minutes to 12 minutes this time.

Many workers regard obsolete norms as an obstacle to further improving their skills, and therefore actively requested revisions. Zhang Guizhen, a young female worker in the drill bit workshop who was the first to propose reducing work-hour norms, is such an example. When this female worker started piecework at the factory in July last year, she often failed to meet the norms. Later, she came up with various ways to shorten auxiliary work hours, and production efficiency began to increase. For the 0.25 and 0.45 mm small drill bits she made, the norm was 2,000 per shift, and she gradually made 4,000, and at most 5,800. As a result, her piece-rate wages exceeded her base wage by more than double. She said: "Exceeding so much every day means that half a day is enough to finish a day's work, and I don't want to use my brain anymore at work. If I am satisfied with the status quo, my skills cannot be improved." Therefore, she proposed to reduce all the parts that exceeded the original norm.

Now, the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant workers have been producing according to the new work-hour norms since January 10th. Because this revision of work-hour norms adopted the method of letting workers discuss and revise them themselves, changing the past practice of leaders issuing targets, the workers are very satisfied. Many workers have expressed full confidence in breaking the new norms.

    不让陈旧定额障碍技术进步
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂职工主动修改定额
    新华社哈尔滨26日电　新华社记者孙若刚报道：哈尔滨量具刃具厂实行计件工资制的职工在讨论今年工时定额的时候，有95％的人主动提出降低工时定额。
    这个工厂投入生产以后劳动生产率步步上升，去年第三季度的劳动生产率比第一季度提高了31.9％，工人的超额计件工资比基本工资超过了38.3％。因此，许多工人都认为原有的陈旧定额不合理。
    工具车间螺丝磨床小组首先提出了要求降低工时定额的意见。这个小组的组长?庆臣由于掌握了磨床技术，提高了生产效率，去年9月份一个月就完成两个月的任务。他在10月份里拿到了一百六十多元的工资。同他一起轮班工作的三级工人的收入也和他差不多。小组工人觉得这样的工时定额太不合理了。比如：做研磨器的时候，每个研磨器的工时定额是二十分钟，但是全组每人每班最多做到四十个，平均每个只用十二分钟；?庆臣最多能做八十个。这样，他每班（八小时）的工作量就等于作了三天多的工作。这个小组的职工在把原有的工时定额和实际达到的生产能力进行对照研究以后，认为在四百四十一种产品中就有四百二十种的工时定额需要降低。
    在全厂修改工时定额中，量具车间千分尺工部的定额还不到修改时间（按规定是半年修改一次，这个组才修改过三个月），但是这个小组在过去执行新定额的三个月中，做千分尺架刨光工作已经突破定额50％。因此，他们这次也要把这项工时定额由二十四分钟降低为十二分钟。
    许多工人把陈旧的定额看成是进一步提高自己的技术的障碍，因此积极要求修改。钻头车间第一个提出降低工时定额的青年女工张桂珍，就是这样一个例子。这个女工去年7月到厂开始做计件活的时候，经常达不到定额。后来，她想出各种缩短辅助工时的办法，生产效率开始提高。她做的零点二五和零点四五公厘的小钻头，每班定额是二千个，她逐渐做到四千个，最多时做到五千八百个。因而，使她的超额计件工资超过基本工资一倍还多。她说：“每天超过这样多，一天的活半天就干完了，工作就再不想动脑筋。如果满于现状，自己的技术也不能提高。”所以她提出要把超过原定额的部分全部降下去。
    现在，哈尔滨量具刃具厂职工已经从1月10日起按照新的工时定额生产了。由于这次修改工时定额采取了让工人自己讨论修改，改变过去领导下指标的办法，工人们很满意。许多工人都表示有充分信心突破新定额。
