Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 24th: The Dalai Lama lectured for three and a half hours on the 23rd in Kalimpong, under a yellow tent pitched on a hillside. About 10,000 people sat on the ground below the hillside to listen to his lecture, most of whom were Tibetans who had long settled in Kalimpong.

    That afternoon, the Dalai Lama received the local Tibetan Sherpa, Tenzing, at his residence. Tenzing was the first person in history to climb Mount Everest, the world's highest peak. Tenzing paid his respects to the Dalai Lama and briefly recounted his conquest of Mount Everest. Tenzing is a Buddhist over thirty years old. He also told the Dalai Lama that after reaching the summit, he bowed in the direction of Tibet to express his gratitude for his success. The Dalai Lama blessed him.

    The Dalai Lama and his party have extended their stay in Kalimpong from the originally planned four days to seven days. On January 24th and January 25th, they will lecture and visit temples in Kalimpong. Then they will go to Darjeeling to participate in the Indian National Day celebrations. On January 27th and 28th, the Dalai Lama will give individual lectures in Kalimpong.
