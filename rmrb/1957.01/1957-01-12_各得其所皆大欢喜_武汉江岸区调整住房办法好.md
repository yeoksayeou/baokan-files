Everyone Gets What They Need, Everyone is Happy
    Wuhan Jiang'an District's Housing Adjustment Method is Good
    (This newspaper's dispatch) According to the Changjiang Daily: Recently, the Wuhan Jiang'an District Real Estate Branch Company piloted a "multi-angle circular" method of adjusting housing, which has achieved certain results.
    The housing problem in Wuhan is very tight. Not only is it difficult for those without housing to find housing, but even those who have housing are not completely satisfied because the houses are not suitable for their needs.
    Recently, comrades from the Huitong Management Station of the Jiang'an District Real Estate Branch Company went deep into the households to understand their difficulties and requirements, and created the "multi-angle circular" adjustment method. Once, they solved the problems of six households in a row. For example: Li Yan's family of nine, spanning three generations, lived together in one room at 96 Nanjing Road; Hu Jinhua at 98 Nanjing Road wanted to live upstairs; Yuan Qichun's family of eight at 57 Nanjing Road had too many people and too few rooms; Zhao Jiaxing's family of two at 94 Nanjing Road had a large house and few people; Luo Buyun at 153 Jianghan Second Road had a dispute with a co-resident (the Twelve Binding Society); and the Twelve Binding Society wanted to expand its factory. All six of these problems were solved with just one room. The method was: a room (with a suite) was vacated at 7 Fuzhong Lane for Li Yan to live in, solving the problem of three generations living in the same room; the original Li Yan's room was given to Hu Jinhua, satisfying his desire to live upstairs; Hu Jinhua's original housing was given to Zhao Jiaxing, reducing his burden; Zhao Jiaxing's room was given to Yuan Qichun, solving his problem of too many people and too few rooms; Yuan Qichun's room was given to Luo Buyun, resolving the dispute between him and the co-resident; Luo's house was allocated to the Twelve Binding Society to expand the factory, facilitating production.

    各得其所皆大欢喜
    武汉江岸区调整住房办法好
    本报讯　据长江日报消息：最近，武汉市江岸区房地产分公司，试行了一种“多角循环”调整住房的方法，收到了一定效果。
    武汉市住房问题很紧张，不仅无房者找房困难，就是有房住的人，因为房子不适合自己的要求也不尽满意。
    最近江岸区房地产分公司汇通经租站的同志们深入到住户中去了解他们的困难和要求，创造了“多角循环”调整法。有一次连环解决了六户问题。如：南京路九十六号李炎三代九口同居一室；南京路九十八号胡锦华想住楼上；南京路五十七号袁启纯一家八口人多房少；南京路九十四号赵家兴一家二口房大人少；江汉二路一百五十三号罗步云与同居者（十二装订社）有纠纷；十二装订社要扩大厂房，这六个问题只用了一间房就全部解决了，方法是：在福忠里七号腾出一间房（有套间）给李炎住，解决了三代同室的问题；原李炎的房给胡锦华住，满足了他想住楼上的要求；胡锦华原来的住房给赵家兴住，减轻了他的负担；赵家兴的房给袁启纯住，解决他人多房少问题，袁启纯的房给罗步云住，解决了他和同居者的纠纷；罗的房子拨给了十二装订社扩厂，便利了生产。
