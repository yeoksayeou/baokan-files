    Welcome Japanese Ice Hockey Team
    Our Correspondent
    The Japanese ice hockey team, led by Mr. Hiroki Onikura, Executive Director of the Japan Ice Sports Federation, arrived in Beijing last night. Our athletes and people welcomed this first sports delegation from neighboring Japan with great enthusiasm.
    Japanese sports have always enjoyed a good reputation in Asia and the world, with outstanding achievements in swimming, wrestling, gymnastics, table tennis and other sports. At the Seventh Winter Olympic Games, Japanese speed skaters set eight new Japanese records and broke four Olympic records. Our people and sports circles attach great importance to these achievements and experiences of Japanese athletes, just as Kyodo News reported on January 11 in a cable about the Japanese ice hockey team's visit to China: "China harbors unparalleled goodwill towards the Japanese sports world."
    The Japanese people and sports circles also have great interest in the young sports cause of New China. People still vividly remember the enthusiastic scenes of the Japanese people welcoming our table tennis delegation last April. Japanese public opinion also gave high praise to the skills of our table tennis players. Kyodo News also wrote in the aforementioned cable: China, "as an emerging sports country, is making astonishing leaps in development, and to Japan, she 'is a hard-to-come-by opponent.'"
    We firmly believe that through the Japanese ice hockey team's visit and competition in our country, the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people and athletes will be further promoted, and the technical level of ice hockey in both countries will be improved.

    欢迎日本冰球代表队
    本报记者
    由日本冰上联盟常务理事会理事鬼鞍弘起先生率领的日本冰球代表队昨晚莅临北京。我国运动员和人民以极热烈的心情，欢迎这个来自邻邦日本的第一个体育团体。
    日本的体育运动在亚洲和世界上一向负有很好的声望，在游泳、摔跤、体操和乒乓球等等运动项目当中更有杰出的成绩。日本速度滑冰运动员在第七届冬季奥林匹克运动会上，创造了八项日本新纪录，打破了四项奥林匹克纪录。我国人民和体育界对于日本运动员的这些成就和经验非常重视，正如日本共同社在本月11日报道日本冰球队访问我国的电文中写的那样：“中国对日本体育界怀有无比的好意”。
    日本人民和体育界对于新中国年轻的体育事业，也同样抱着很大的兴趣。去年4月日本人民欢迎我国乒乓球代表队的那种热情洋溢的情景，人们记忆犹新。日本舆论对于我国乒乓球运动员的技术也给予很高的评价。共同社在上述电文中还写道：中国“作为一个新兴的运动国家正在取得惊人的飞跃的发展，她对日本说来‘是一个求之而不可多得的比赛对手’”。
    我们深信通过日本冰球代表队在我国的访问比赛，将进一步促进中日两国人民和运动员之间的友谊，并使两国冰球运动技术水平获得提高。
