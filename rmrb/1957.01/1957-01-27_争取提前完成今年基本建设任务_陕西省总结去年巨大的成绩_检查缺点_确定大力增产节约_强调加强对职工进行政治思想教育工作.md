Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 26th: At the Shaanxi Provincial Basic Construction Work Conference, which closed on January 23, it was decided to vigorously launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy this year and to strengthen political and ideological education for employees, in order to ensure the comprehensive and over-fulfillment of the 1957 basic construction plan.

    1956 was the year with the largest scale of basic construction in the Shaanxi region, and great achievements were obtained during this year. The vast number of employees saved a large amount of steel, cement, and wood in the construction process. The savings in the Xi'an area alone amounted to 210,000 taels of gold when converted. The average construction cost was reduced by 30%. At the same time, a strong basic construction team was trained and a lot of basic construction experience was accumulated, creating favorable conditions for future construction. However, there were also many shortcomings in the work. The plan formulated in the first half of last year was too high, and some projects that were impossible and should not have been brought forward were advanced. In order to catch up with tasks and rush progress, regardless of whether there were conditions, emphasis was placed on starting construction early and starting many projects. As a result, construction was carried out in violation of construction procedures, and because materials and drawings could not be supplied in time, many projects were started and stopped intermittently, causing great waste to the projects. In many units, due to rushing progress, the principles of good, fast, plentiful, economical, and safe were not seriously implemented, resulting in poor project quality and serious industrial accidents. Political and ideological education for employees was also weak.

    In response to the above-mentioned problems, the conference determined that in 1957, the province's basic construction work should resolutely overcome subjectivism and bureaucratism in leadership, vigorously launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy, and strive to improve the political and ideological awareness and professional skills of employees, in order to strive to complete or over-fulfill this year's basic construction tasks ahead of schedule. Although the basic construction tasks in the Shaanxi region this year have been reduced a lot compared with 1956, the quality requirements for basic construction work this year are higher, and various technical and economic quotas have been increased significantly compared with last year. Moreover, this year is the last year of the country's first five-year plan. The basic construction departments in the Shaanxi region must not only complete the tasks stipulated in the country's first five-year plan, but also prepare for the second five-year plan. Therefore, the conference required basic construction departments and relevant party and government leading organs to fully recognize the complexity and arduousness of completing this year's tasks, and vigorously launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy.

    The conference believes that saving materials is the central link of economy in basic construction departments. Therefore, all units are required to complete the targets for saving raw materials based on the principles of taking materials locally, rational transportation, and rational utilization, while ensuring quality. In particular, it is necessary to vigorously promote technical measures such as prestressed reinforced concrete, cold-drawn steel bars, and dry-hard concrete to save steel and cement; and to conscientiously promote various advanced experiences in saving wood.

    The conference also particularly emphasized the importance of strengthening political and ideological education for basic construction workers. The conference pointed out that the number of basic construction workers in the Shaanxi region increased significantly last year, and many small producers and members of other classes have joined the ranks of the working class, bringing with them non-working-class ideologies. In addition, the basic construction departments weakened the political and ideological work for employees last year, so the thinking of the employees of basic construction enterprises is quite chaotic at present. Therefore, strengthening the political and ideological education of employees is of great significance for ensuring the successful completion of this year's basic construction tasks and the unity of the working class. The conference required the party committees of various basic construction departments to regard this work as one of the important tasks at present, and to patiently, systematically, and positively conduct education on labor concepts, labor discipline, communist morality, hard work and plain living, and the relationship between individual interests and collective interests for all employees. The conference decided that in the first half of this year, basic construction units in the Shaanxi region will universally and deeply conduct education on hard work and plain living among the masses of employees, and at the same time, combine the completion of this year's tasks with education on cherishing state property, emphasizing project quality, and safe production.

    This conference started on January 16 and was convened by the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China.

    争取提前完成今年基本建设任务
    陕西省总结去年巨大的成绩　检查缺点　确定大力增产节约
    强调加强对职工进行政治思想教育工作
    据新华社西安26日电　在1月23日闭幕的陕西省基本建设工作会议上，确定今年大力开展增产节约运动和加强对职工的政治思想教育工作，以便保证全面和超额完成1957年基本建设计划。
    1956年是陕西地区基本建设规模最大的一年，在这一年获得了巨大的成绩。广大职工在建设中节约了大量钢材、水泥和木材，仅西安地区节约的数字折合黄金就达二十一万两，建筑造价平均降低30％。同时还锻炼出一支强大的基本建设队伍，积累了很多基本建设经验，为今后建设创造了有利条件。但在工作中也存在很多缺点，去年上半年制定的计划偏高，把一些不可能和不应该提前的工程也提前了。为了赶任务，抢进度，不管有无条件，强调早开工，多开工。结果，便违反施工程序施工，而且由于材料和图纸供应不上，不少工程时开时停，此开彼停，给工程造成很大浪费，有不少单位由于赶进度，没有认真贯彻好、快、多、省和安全的方针，工程质量低劣，工伤事故严重，对职工政治思想教育工作也很薄弱。
    会议针对上述问题，确定1957年全省基本建设工作要坚决克服领导上的主观主义、官僚主义，大力开展增产节约运动，努力提高职工的政治思想觉悟和业务水平，争取提前或超额完成今年的基本建设任务。今年陕西地区的基本建设任务虽然比1956年减少了很多，但是，今年基本建设工作的质量要求高了，各项技术经济定额比去年提高很多，而且今年是国家第一个五年计划的最后一年，陕西地区的基本建设部门不仅要完成国家第一个五年计划中规定的任务，还要为第二个五年计划作好准备。因此，会议要求基本建设部门和有关党政领导机关，充分认识完成今年任务的复杂性和艰巨性，大力开展增产节约运动。
    会议认为：节约用料是基本建设部门节约的中心环节。因此，要求各单位本着就地取材、合理运输、合理利用的原则，在保证质量的前提下，完成节约原材料指标。特别是要大力推广预应力钢筋混凝土、冷拉钢筋和干硬性混凝土等技术措施节约钢材、水泥；认真推广各种节约木材的先进经验。
    会议还特别强调加强对基本建设职工的政治思想教育工作的重要性。会议指出，去年陕西地区基本建设工人数量大量增加，其中有许多小生产者和其他阶级成员加入到工人阶级队伍中来，带来了非工人阶级的思想意识，加之去年基本建设部门对职工政治思想工作薄弱，因而目前基本建设企业职工的思想相当混乱。因此，加强职工政治思想教育对保证今年基本建设的任务胜利完成和工人阶级的团结，具有非常重大的意义。会议要求各基本建设部门的党委把这一工作当作当前重要工作之一，要对全体职工耐心地、系统地、正面地进行劳动观念、劳动纪律、共产主义道德、艰苦朴素、个人利益和集体利益的关系等教育。会议决定在今年上半年，陕西地区各基本建设单位普遍深入地向职工群众进行艰苦朴素的教育，同时结合完成今年任务进行爱护国家财产、重视工程质量和安全生产的教育。
    这次会议是在1月16日开始，由中共陕西省委召开的。
