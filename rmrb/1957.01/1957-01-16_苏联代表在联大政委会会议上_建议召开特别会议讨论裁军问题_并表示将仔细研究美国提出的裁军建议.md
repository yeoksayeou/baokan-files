Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 15th: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on the 14th to begin discussing the issue of disarmament. Soviet Representative Kuznetsov put forward a proposal requesting the convening of a special session of the United Nations General Assembly to specifically discuss disarmament issues.

In his speech, Kuznetsov pointed out that the disarmament issue is one of the most acute and important issues in current international affairs. If an agreement is reached on the issue of disarmament, stopping the arms race and its huge non-productive expenditures that harm the welfare of the people, and eliminating the constant threat of localized conflicts turning into world wars, then the United Nations will have made a very significant contribution to easing international tensions and safeguarding and consolidating the cause of peace.

Kuznetsov said that the Soviet government's proposals of November 17 last year touched upon all aspects of the disarmament issue. These proposals have received widespread support from public opinion. We have the right to believe that this detailed and comprehensive plan for resolving the disarmament issue should not only be given due study, but should also inevitably be supported within the United Nations.

Kuznetsov said that the Soviet government had frankly stated in its statement of November 17 last year the full seriousness of the current stage of international relations. This statement pointed out the dangerous situation created by the unwarranted armed aggression against Egypt by the United Kingdom, France, and Israel. Now, the heroic resistance of the Egyptian people, the worldwide condemnation of aggression, and the stern warnings of peace forces to the aggressors have forced the invaders to cease their military operations against Egypt. However, the countries of the Middle East are now facing the great danger of being subjected to colonial oppression again, this time from the United States. The so-called Middle East plan recently put forward by the United States is a very blatant plan of imperialist expansion, which contains a serious threat to the peace and security of the region.

He pointed out that the aggression against Egypt by the United Kingdom, France, and Israel, and the failure of the counter-revolutionary conspiracy in Hungary, have caused the North Atlantic bloc countries to set off a new frenzy of expanding armaments. Those groups in the Western countries who oppose peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between capitalism and socialism are doing everything possible to restore the "Cold War."

Kuznetsov pointed out that there are now two possible paths before all countries: one is the path of ending the "Cold War" and rejecting the policy of "strength," and the other is the path of continuing the arms race, continuing the "Cold War," hostility and non-intercourse between one country and another, creating a path to devastating war. If the interests of all peoples are taken into account, then the only path that should and can be chosen is the path that leads to maintaining and consolidating peace, which is the path of stopping the "Cold War," disarmament, and banning nuclear weapons.

Kuznetsov said that we must calmly and realistically analyze all the specific proposals and plans we now have on the issue of disarmament, and first reach agreement on those provisions that should be implemented quickly. Some issues can be agreed upon as long as all parties are willing. However, it is very regrettable that this has not been possible until now, primarily because the representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France are stubbornly unwilling to reach any agreement on the disarmament issue. In this regard, Kuznetsov spoke in detail about a series of major efforts made by the Soviet Union to resolve the issue of disarmament and the banning of atomic weapons, as well as the process by which Western countries rejected these efforts. Kuznetsov again called for expanding the composition of the United Nations Disarmament Commission and its Sub-Committee, and instructed them to study all proposals on the disarmament issue. He pointed out that one of the reasons why the work of the United Nations Disarmament Commission and its Sub-Committee has not made progress is also due to the narrowness of the composition of the committee and the confidential nature of the discussions.

U.S. Representative Lodge presented the United States' five-point proposal at the meeting, including a ban on further stockpiling of nuclear weapons, international supervision of space missiles, and restrictions on the number of troops in major powers. Lodge said that this plan is based on the establishment of a monitoring and inspection system first, and the United States has no intention of reaching an agreement on reducing armaments and banning atomic and hydrogen weapons until an inspection system is established. He said that the United States will provide more specific details of the U.S. plan when the United Nations Disarmament Commission's Sub-Committee reconvenes.

Speaking of Lodge's speech, Kuznetsov said that the U.S. representative's disarmament statement is noteworthy, and the Soviet side will carefully study this proposal. The Soviet delegation is prepared to study and support any other proposals, if these proposals really lead to practical results in disarmament.

After French Representative Moch spoke, the meeting adjourned. The next meeting will be held on the 15th.

    苏联代表在联大政委会会议上
    建议召开特别会议讨论裁军问题
    并表示将仔细研究美国提出的裁军建议
    新华社15日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会14日举行会议，开始讨论裁军问题。苏联代表库兹涅佐夫提出一个提案，要求召开专门讨论裁军问题的联合国大会特别会议。
    库兹涅佐夫在发言中指出，裁军问题是现在国际问题中的一个最尖锐和最重要的问题。如果就裁军问题取得协议，停止武装竞赛及其巨大的损害人民福利的非生产性开支，消除局部性冲突变为世界性战争的经常威胁，那么，联合国便对缓和国际紧张局势、捍卫和巩固和平的事业作出了非常重大的贡献。
    库兹涅佐夫说，去年11月17日苏联政府的建议接触到了裁军问题的各个方面。这些建议得到了舆论的广泛支持。我们有权利认为，这个解决裁军问题的详尽而全面的计划不仅应该得到适当的研究，而且必然应该在联合国内得到支持。
    库兹涅佐夫说，苏联政府在去年11月17日的声明中已经直言不讳地说明了现阶段国际关系的全部严重性。这个声明指出了英、法、以三国无端地武装侵略埃及所形成的危险局势。现在，埃及人民的英勇抵抗、全世界对侵略的谴责以及和平力量对侵略者的严厉警告迫使侵犯者停止了对埃及的军事行动。但是，中近东国家现在还面临着再度遭受殖民压迫的巨大的危险，这次压迫将来自美国方面。美国新近提出的所谓中近东计划是一个非常露骨的帝国主义扩张计划，它含有对这个地区的和平和安全的严重威胁。
    他指出，英、法、以三国对埃及的侵略，以及在匈牙利进行反革命阴谋的失败，使得北大西洋集团国家掀起了新的扩张军备狂热。西方国家那些反对资本主义和社会主义和平共处和和平竞赛的集团，正在尽一切努力来重新恢复“冷战”。
    库兹涅佐夫指出，现在摆在各国面前的有两条可能的道路：一条是结束“冷战”、拒绝“实力”政策的道路，另一条是继续军备竞赛、继续“冷战”、一个国家和另一国家敌视、不相往来，造成毁灭性战争的道路。如果考虑到各国人民的利益，那末应当并且可能选择的只有导致维护和巩固和平的道路，这就是停止“冷战”、裁军和禁止核子武器的道路。
    库兹涅佐夫说，必须心平气和和实事求是地分析我们现在所有的关于裁军问题的具体建议和计划，并且，首先就那些应该迅速实现的条款达成协议。有些问题只要各方面愿意是可以达成协议的。然而非常遗憾的是，直到现在还没有能够做到这一点，这首先是因为美国、英国和法国的代表顽固地不愿意就裁军问题达成任何协议。在这方面，库兹涅佐夫详细地谈到了苏联为了解决裁军和禁止原子武器问题而作的一系列重大努力，以及西方国家拒绝这些努力的过程。库兹涅佐夫再次要求扩大联合国裁军委员会及其小组委员会的组成，并且责成它们研究关于裁军问题的一切建议。他指出，联合国裁军委员会及其小组委员会的工作所以没有取得进展，原因之一还由于委员会的组成的狭隘性和讨论的秘密性质。
    美国代表洛奇在会上提出美国的五点建议，包括禁止进一步储存核子武器，对空间导弹实行国际监督，限制大国军队数目等。洛奇说，这个计划是以首先建立监督和视察制度为基础的，在建立视察制度以前，美国并无意就裁减军备和禁止原子武器和氢武器达成协议。他说，在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会重新举行会议的时候，美国将提供更多的美国计划的具体细节。
    库兹涅佐夫在谈到洛奇发言时说，美国代表的裁军声明是值得注意的，苏联方面将要仔细研究这个建议。苏联代表团是准备研究和支持其他任何建议的，如果这些建议在裁军方面真的导致产生实际的结果的话。
    在法国代表莫克发言以后，会议休会。下次会议在15日举行。
