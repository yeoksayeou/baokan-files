Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd dispatch from Washington: The Eisenhower government is intensifying steps to win Congressional support for its new military-economic plan to invade the Middle East.

After Eisenhower's meeting with Congressional leaders on January 1st, Dulles visited Congress again on the 2nd. Dulles first met with Speaker of the House Rayburn and other House leaders to explain the new plan. Then, he went to the Senate leaders and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to request the Senate to take "positive action" on the Middle East issue.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee issued a statement after its meeting, saying that Dulles described the Middle East situation as "dangerous." Dulles said that if the draft resolution of the government's Middle East plan, which he submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was not passed, "the danger of war will increase."

Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, George, said that he believed the bill should stipulate that armed "aid" should only be given to a Middle Eastern country after it has been attacked and requested assistance. However, according to the government's draft resolution, the United States may send troops to the Middle East without prior advice from the United Nations.

White House Press Secretary Hagerty had revealed the government's "high-speed timetable" for seeking Congressional action on the Middle East issue as soon as possible, but according to Congressional sources, Congress will not take final action for at least two or three weeks.

    美国政府加紧采取步骤
    争取国会支持侵略中东计划
    据新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：艾森豪威尔政府正在加紧采取步骤，争取国会支持它的侵入中东的新的军事—经济计划。
    在艾森豪威尔1日同国会领袖进行会谈以后，杜勒斯2日又访问了国会。杜勒斯首先同众议院议长雷朋和众议院的其他领袖进行会谈，解释这个新计划。接着，他又到参议院领袖们和参议院外交委员会那里去，要求参议院在中东问题上采取“积极的行动”。
    参议院外交委员会开会以后发表声明说，杜勒斯把中东局势说得很“危险”，杜勒斯说，如果不通过他向参议院外交委员会提出来的政府中东计划的决议草案，“战争的危险将会增加”。
    参议院外交委员会主席乔治说，他认为这项议案应该规定，只是在一个遭到攻击的国家提出要求之后才给予一个中东国家以武装“援助”，可是根据政府的决议草案，美国可能不事先得到联合国的建议就派兵到中东去。
    白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂曾经透露政府关于尽快争取国会就中东问题采取行动的“高速度时间表”，但是，据国会人士说，国会至少在两三个星期内不会采取最后行动。
