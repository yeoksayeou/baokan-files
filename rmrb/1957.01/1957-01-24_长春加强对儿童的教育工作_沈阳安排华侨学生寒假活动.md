Changchun Strengthens Educational Work for Children
Shenyang Arranges Winter Vacation Activities for Overseas Chinese Students

(Our newspaper report) Changchun City's district cultural centers and Xinhua bookstores, under the leadership of the Municipal Bureau of Culture, have recently taken active measures to strengthen educational work for children.

To open up activity venues for children, three district cultural centers in the city have newly established children's reading rooms. There are now four children's reading rooms in the city, with nearly two thousand children visiting them every day. Some district cultural centers, lacking the conditions to establish children's reading rooms, allocate two hours of adult reading time for children's reading. In addition, to expand the scope of children's reading, mobile book stations have been established in twenty-seven primary schools in the city, and thirty reading groups have been organized. Six children's reading stations have also been established on the streets.

The Xinhua Bookstore's children's department has added more than five hundred new books, now totaling more than two thousand one hundred books and picture albums. Sales staff also actively help children choose books and recommend excellent reading materials to schools.

To help children understand the content of films, the Children's Cinema has equipped activity rooms and reading rooms with counselors to explain the films to children. In addition, they also hold film story report meetings, lectures, and various exhibitions.

Currently, various units are planning interesting activities to enable children to spend a happy winter vacation and Spring Festival. The Children's Cinema has already started a children's chess competition on January 21st and will hold a lantern riddle party during the Lantern Festival.

The district cultural centers plan to hold story lectures, book reports, arts and entertainment, games, and evening parties. (Shi Wen)
