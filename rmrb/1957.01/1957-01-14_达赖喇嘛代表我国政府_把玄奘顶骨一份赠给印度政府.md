Xinhua News Agency, Nalanda, 13th: The Dalai Lama, representing the government of the People's Republic of China, presented a portion of Xuanzang's skull relic to the Indian government in Nalanda on the afternoon of the 12th. Prime Minister Nehru accepted the relic on behalf of the Indian government.

Approximately 50,000 people attended the presentation ceremony. They came from all over Bihar, some by ox cart and some even on foot. When the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, Prime Minister Nehru, and Chinese Ambassador to India Pan Zili took to the podium, Nalanda was submerged in cheers. The four of them arrived in Nalanda on the morning of the 12th by plane from Delhi.

Thirteen hundred years ago, the eminent Tang Dynasty monk Xuanzang came to Nalanda from China. He studied and lectured here for many years.

In his speech at the presentation ceremony, the Dalai Lama said, "Xuanzang is a historical figure who had the closest relationship with Nalanda and made outstanding contributions to Sino-Indian cultural and religious exchange. As Sino-Indian friendly cooperation becomes increasingly close and develops, recalling his achievements makes us feel even more the value of the traditional friendship between China and India."

He pointed out that for five or six hundred years after the fifth century AD, Nalanda was the center of Sino-Indian academic, cultural, and religious exchange. He congratulated the revival of Nalanda. He also wished that the flowers of Indian national culture and Sino-Indian friendship would become increasingly brilliant.

Then, the Dalai Lama handed over a portion of Xuanzang's skull relic, 1,335 volumes of Xuanzang's translations, and a copy of the Jisha Tripitaka to Nehru, asking him to pass them on to the Nalanda Research Institute. The Dalai Lama also, on behalf of the Chinese government, donated 300,000 yuan RMB as funding for the construction of the Xuanzang Memorial Hall in Nalanda, and handed over a copy of the design sketch of the memorial hall to Nehru. Nehru placed the Xuanzang skull relic in a small Chinese golden pagoda on the stage. At this moment, several monks wearing yellow robes chanted scriptures.

Nehru said in his speech that this ceremony takes us back 1,300 years and reminds us how long the connection between India and China has been. We also remember Xuanzang and his greatness, because he not only overcame the difficulties of climate and the high mountains of the Himalayas to come to India, but also studied and translated what he learned into Chinese. Thanks to Xuanzang's labor, many religious texts that could not be found in India can be found in China.

Nehru said that he thanked the Chinese government for the invaluable gift and donation. Speaking of Indo-Chinese relations, he said that the exchanges between India and China were not exchanges of money but of culture and ideas. He hoped that this event would promote this relationship.

The governor of Bihar State, Diwakar, who presided over the ceremony, emphasized in his welcoming speech the importance of continuing to maintain the friendly relations between India and China advocated by Xuanzang.

The ceremony ended before dark. Before the ceremony, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen, accompanied by Nehru and Chinese Ambassador Pan Zili, visited the Nalanda Temple where Xuanzang had stayed. The temple has been completely ruined, and due to recent excavations, part of the temple's huge buildings has been put back in front of people. The guests also visited the nearby museum, which houses many excavated sculptures and other antiquities.

    达赖喇嘛代表我国政府
    把玄奘顶骨一份赠给印度政府
    新华社那烂陀13日电　达赖喇嘛12日下午在那烂陀代表中华人民共和国政府把玄奘顶骨一份赠给印度政府。尼赫鲁总理代表印度政府接受了顶骨。
    大约有五万人参加了赠送仪式。他们从比哈尔邦各地赶来，有些人是乘牛车甚至步行来的。当达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼、尼赫鲁总理和中国驻印度大使潘自力走上讲坛时，那烂陀淹没在一片欢呼声中。他们四个人是在12日上午从德里乘飞机到达那烂陀的。
    一千三百年前，中国唐代高僧玄奘从中国来到那烂陀。他有好几年在这里学习和讲经。
    达赖喇嘛在赠送仪式上致词说：“玄奘是一位同那烂陀关系最密切而又对中印文化、宗教交流有着卓越贡献的历史人物。在中印两国友好合作日趋密切和发展的今天，回忆起他的业绩，使我们更加感到中印传统友谊的可贵。”
    他指出在公元五世纪以后的五、六百年中，那烂陀一直是中印学术、文化和宗教交流的中心。他对于那烂陀的复兴表示祝贺。他并且祝印度民族文化和中印友好的花朵日益灿烂。
    然后，达赖把玄奘顶骨一份、玄奘的译著一千三百三十五卷以及积沙藏佛经一部交给尼赫鲁，请他转交给那烂陀研究院。达赖还代表中国政府捐赠人民币三十万元作为在那烂陀建筑玄奘纪念堂的费用，并且把纪念堂的设计草图一份交给尼赫鲁。尼赫鲁把玄奘顶骨放在台上的一座小的中国金塔里。这时，几个披着黄色袈裟的和尚朗诵起经文。
    尼赫鲁致词说，这次仪式使我们回到了一千三百年以前，并且提醒了我们印度和中国的联系有多么悠久。我们也想起了玄奘和他的伟大，因为他不仅克服了气候和喜马拉雅山的崇山峻岭的困难而来到了印度，而且还进行学习并且把学到的东西译成了中文。由于玄奘的劳动，在印度找不到的许多宗教经文可以在中国找到。
    尼赫鲁说，他感谢中国政府赠送的无限宝贵的礼物和捐款。他在谈到印中关系时说，印度和中国之间的交往并不是金钱而是文化和思想的交往。他希望目前这件事将促进这种关系。
    主持这次仪式的比哈尔邦邦长迪瓦卡尔在致欢迎词时，强调指出继续保持玄奘所倡导的印中两国友好关系的重要性。
    仪式在天黑以前结束。在这次仪式举行以前，达赖和班禅在尼赫鲁和中国大使潘自力的陪同下参观了玄奘曾经停留过的那烂陀寺。这个寺院已经完全成为废墟，由于最近进行的发掘工作，寺院的巨大建筑物的一部分又摆在人们眼前了。客人们还参观了附近的博物馆，博物馆里藏有发掘出来的许多雕刻品和其他古物。
