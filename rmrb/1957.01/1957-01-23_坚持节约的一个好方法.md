    A Good Way to Persist in Thrift
    By our reporters Wang Qi and Zhang Jianhong

    Walking into the tractor factory construction site, people cheer for the new factory buildings that are constantly being added. However, the workers building the tractor factory have another concern: to ensure that not a single penny of the state's construction funds is wasted! The Luoyang Engineering Bureau, based on this idea of the workers, implemented team economic accounting and persisted in the thrift movement for a year, turning thrift into a major concern for every worker at all times.

    Since the Luoyang Engineering Bureau began building the tractor factory in 1955, there had been the idea that "key construction projects inevitably involve waste," and the "Jin Guyuan" waste incident that was published in the newspaper was a manifestation of this idea. The "Jin Guyuan" incident and the subsequent anti-waste movement sounded an alarm in the minds of the workers. The leaders of the Engineering Bureau realized from their actual work in 1955 that if the anti-waste and practice-thrift movement that had already begun was not continued, then waste would still occur every day. For example, in the first half of 1955, the Engineering Bureau launched an anti-waste movement and saved more than 200 million yuan, but when the year-end settlement was made, it did not complete the cost reduction target. The Central Ministry of Construction Engineering required a 5% cost reduction, but only 0.344% was actually achieved. At this time, the management personnel complained that the workers had not completed the plan; the workers said, "If I don't have materials, can I install my thigh!" The leadership emphasized the need to fully complete the plan; but some people believed that saving money meant that quality could not be guaranteed. In short, the majority of workers did not take the work of practicing thrift very seriously.

    1956 was the year with the heaviest construction task for the Luoyang Engineering Bureau. It was necessary to complete the construction of the exterior of twelve factory buildings, and by the end of the year, ten workshops had started production ahead of schedule. Faced with this complex and arduous task, how could workers be mobilized to fully complete the state plan and save construction funds? In summarizing the work in 1955, the trade union convened a meeting of worker representatives, and based on past experiences and lessons, decided to launch an advanced producer movement centered on the implementation of economic accounting in 1956.

    The Luoyang Engineering Bureau took team economic accounting as the first step in mobilizing workers. After the state plan and targets were issued, the trade union universally mobilized workers to discuss and formulate team savings plans and advanced measures to complete the plan, and regarded this as a competition goal. This linked everyone's actions to the entire plan. Since then, the majority of groups in the bureau have formulated savings plans, and those who did not have the conditions have worked hard to create them and strive to implement team economic accounting. According to statistics from seven work areas, an average of 67.2% of teams implemented economic accounting, with the highest reaching 82%.

    Facts have proved that the groups that implement team economic accounting are the most active in their work. After the 102nd work area began to implement team economic accounting, the workers' work attitude was new, and their work methods were also new. When the group discussed the state consumption indicators, the material consumption rate was always lower than the state's regulations, and the actual results often exceeded the group's savings plan. When Zhang Lianbao's group in this work area discussed the savings plan, all twelve workers in the group had to clarify three things: what is everyone's savings task, what are the benefits of saving for the country and the individual, and we must not ignore other indicators for the sake of saving. The workers in this group knew that cement accounted for a large proportion of the cost of each project and that the country lacked cement, so they came up with the method of padding yellow sand under the concrete, saving a lot of concrete. They also thought that it was not enough to save cement only during construction, but also to eliminate the phenomenon of cement waste in other aspects. Concrete came from the mixing plant. In the past, the concrete was transported and dumped in the open air far from the construction site, and then transported when needed, wasting a lot of concrete. They came up with a way to contact the mixing plant in advance, transport as much as needed, and use it as soon as it was transported. This could save cement and ensure the quality of the project. In this way, from July to early December last year, this group saved seventy-eight cubic meters of concrete and received a bonus of four hundred and eighty yuan.

    Since the 102nd work area fully implemented team economic accounting, from January to October last year, it reduced costs by more than 440,000 yuan, accounting for 9.5% of the total cost of the work area. The value of raw materials saved was more than 22,900 yuan. More importantly, a climate of thrift has emerged on the construction site. On the construction site of the auxiliary workshop, the bricklayers of the 102nd work area used to pick only good bricks, and threw away any bricks with even a slight defect. Mud was also thrown everywhere, and these valuable materials were slowly buried underground and turned into waste. This was the scene when the first layer of wall was being built. When building the second layer of wall, this work area had already implemented team economic accounting. The workers used their rest time to dig out more than 2,000 bricks from the ground at one time. When laying bricks, if mud dropped on the ground, it was immediately scraped up and reused. This work area circulated such a saying: "The same bricks, used by the same workers, have two different fates. One is to be thrown on the ground at will and trampled on; the other is to repair the incomplete bricks and neatly lay them on the wall, which looks solid and beautiful." The significance of this thrift is not only that nearly 100 tons of steel, more than 740 cubic meters of wood, and more than 2,700 tons of cement were saved in six months, but more importantly, this spirit of thrift was integrated into every piece of work! On the construction site of the tractor factory, such things can be encountered anytime and anywhere: the steel bar joint welding has been changed to butt welding, the lifting rings on large reinforced concrete workpieces have been changed to steel wire lifting, and many templates that have been used four or five times have been properly preserved for future use. Thrift is continuing every moment.

    The purpose of promoting team economic accounting is to reduce costs, and costs are related to all work in the enterprise, such as the quality of the project, the savings or waste in the use of labor, the amount of raw materials consumed, and so on. The result of promoting team economic accounting is that all aspects of work have been comprehensively improved. Only in this case is it possible to practice thrift regularly. On the various construction sites of the Luoyang Engineering Bureau, various teams have learned through team economic accounting the importance of ensuring project quality in saving, and also the need to improve technology in order to ensure project quality. Therefore, the workers compare the promotion of team economic accounting to the gate to improving technology. Once this gate is opened, everyone wants to improve their technology, and batches of advanced workers enter this gate. Those who were originally apprentices suddenly became skilled workers, and those who originally had low skills improved their skills. When workers encounter difficulties, they use their brains to find tricks, promote advanced experience, and overcome the past practice of increasing labor intensity whenever there was a movement. At this time, the trade union tried its best to ensure that workers continued to improve technically. During the inspection and comparison every ten days and every month, in addition to comparing whether the plan was advanced, it was also necessary to compare whether the construction method was advanced. Only those who were advanced in both aspects could become an advanced group. Through this method, the trade union led the workers' enthusiasm for labor onto the broad road of learning and improving technology. From January to September last year, workers put forward more than 2,480 rationalization proposals, and nearly 1,000 were adopted. This increased the workers' confidence in learning and improving technology. The Lu Xingbang painting team tried to save tung oil, so they learned the advanced experience of adding lime water. At first, it was always unsatisfactory, but they were not discouraged, and finally the experiment was successful, saving more than 160 kilograms of tung oil. Workers are no longer interested in the old method of working overtime to complete tasks. The Ji Fuchang group of the 104th work area worked overtime to overfulfill the task, but the workers did not rate them as an advanced group. The Li Yele bamboo work group of the 102nd work area was initially afraid that their technology would not be good enough to meet the quota, but now all the workers in the group have become workers who have mastered the technology of their profession from unskilled workers. In this process, the technical personnel also moved. No matter which advanced measure to save materials, it has been strictly identified by the Materials Testing Institute, which ensures the quality of the project.

    The wider and more effective the promotion of team economic accounting, the higher the socialist consciousness of the masses, and a climate of mutual supervision and mutual assistance naturally forms between the upper and lower levels, and between the left and right. Originally, the Yang Wenxiang group of the 105th work area could complete the task every month, but the quality was not good; although the quality of the Xu Honggen group was good, it could not complete the task. These two groups signed a mutual assistance contract and competed with each other. As a result, both groups overfulfilled the task by more than 50%, and the quality was also improved.

    In the past, the cost settlement work of the 102nd work area was not correct. At the beginning of last year, 70,000 yuan was miscalculated in one month, which affected the economic accounting work. After the criticism and supervision of the Economic Activity Analysis Committee of the work area, the method of contact contract was adopted to improve the cost accounting work. Now, the monthly cost settlement is very accurate. In the past, no matter whether it was a department, a work section, or a work area, whenever there was a competition, especially a savings competition, the workers were always very enthusiastic, but the department personnel were cold, and the foreman, section chief, and work area director were not very nervous. After the implementation of team economic accounting, the workers followed behind every day to ask for task lists. To issue task lists, a set of work followed: limited material requisition, cost accounting, etc., and many problems had to be solved. To solve these problems, the foreman, section, and work area also had to implement economic accounting, and everyone had to have an economic accounting perspective. After the Engineering Bureau promoted team economic accounting, it then started the economic accounting of the foreman, work section, and work area. The departments launched two kinds of competitions, one was a business competition, and the other was a contact contract. 90% of the departments signed advanced indicators. Seven departments, including production, technical supply, and financial accounting, signed contact contracts to ensure in-depth field work and solve problems specifically.

    Someone told us that the construction site of the tractor factory can be called a civilized construction site. We did not quite believe it, but a chance occurrence gave an answer to this question. One day, an engineer led us to visit the tractor factory. He saw that we were wearing cloth shoes and kindly warned us: "Be careful! A nail might run out somewhere and prick your foot." However, we walked through many places and did not find a single nail. Afterwards, we learned that this engineer had not been to the construction site for a long time, and reality had already run ahead of him.

    坚持节约的一个好方法
    本报记者　汪琦　张健虹
    走进拖拉机厂工地，人们为它不断增添的新厂房而欢呼。但是，建设拖拉机厂的职工们却又多了一重心事：无论如何不让国家建设资金有一点浪费！洛阳工程局就在职工的这个思想基础上，推行了班组经济核算，把节约运动坚持了一年，使节约变成每个职工时刻关心的大事。
    洛阳工程局从1955年开始建设拖拉机厂以来，曾有过“重点建设、浪费难免”的思想，报纸上公布过的“金谷园”浪费事件，就是这种思想的表现。“金谷园”事件和接着而起的反浪费运动，在职工思想上敲起了警钟。工程局的领导人员，从1955年实际工作中体会到：要不把已经开始了的反对浪费、厉行节约的运动坚持下去，那末浪费现象还是会每天发生的。譬如，1955年上半年工程局开展了反浪费运动，节约了两亿多元，但是当年终结算的时候，却没有完成降低成本的指标，中央建筑工程部要求降低成本5％，实际只完成了0.344％。这时管理人员埋怨工人没有完成计划；工人就说：“没有材料，我能把大腿安上！”领导上强调要全面完成计划；却有人认为：要节约就不能保证质量。总之，广大职工并没有把厉行节约工作看得很重要。
    1956年是洛阳工程局建筑任务最重的一年，要完成十二个厂房外形的建筑，到年底有十个车间提前开工生产。在这复杂而繁重的任务面前，怎样发动职工全面完成国家计划，节约建设资金呢？在总结1955年工作的时候，工会召开了职工代表会，根据过去的经验教训，研究确定1956年开展一个以推行经济核算为中心的先进生产者运动。
    洛阳工程局把班组经济核算作为发动职工的第一步。当国家计划和指标下达以后，工会就普遍发动职工讨论，订出班组的节约计划和完成计划的先进措施，而且把这个作为竞赛的目标。这就把每个人的行动同整个计划联系起来了。从此，全局大多数小组都纷纷制定了节约计划，没有条件的也努力创造条件，争取实行班组经济核算。据七个工区的统计，平均有67.2％的班组实行经济核算，最高的达到82％。
    事实证明，凡是实行班组经济核算的小组，他们的工作最活跃。一○二工区开始实行班组经济核算以后，工人的工作态度是新的、工作方法也是新的，小组讨论国家耗损指标时，材料的耗损率总比国家规定的低，而实际做的结果常常又超过小组订的节约计划。这个工区的张连宝小组在讨论节约计划时，全组十二个工人都要明确三件事：每个人的节约任务是什么，节约了对国家和个人有什么好处，不能为了节约忽视其他指标。这个小组的工人知道水泥在每个工程成本中占很大的比重，知道国家缺乏水泥，便想出了在混凝土下面垫黄沙的办法，节约了许多混凝土。他们又想到光在施工时节约水泥还不够，还要消灭其他方面浪费水泥的现象。混凝土是从搅拌厂来的，过去混凝土运来了就倒在离施工的地方很远的露天地里，用的时候再去运来，浪费了不少混凝土。他们便想了一个办法，先同搅拌厂联系好，要多少运多少，运到就用，这样既可以节省水泥，又可以保证工程质量。这个小组就这样从去年7月到12月上旬，节约了七十八立方公尺混凝土，得到了四百八十元的奖金。
    一○二工区全面推行班组经济核算以来，从去年1月到10月，降低成本四十四万多元，占工区总成本的9.5％。节约原材料价值两万二千九百多元。更重要的是工地上出现了节约的风气。在辅助工场的工地上，原来一○二工区的砌砖工人只挑好砖用，只要有一点缺陷就随手扔掉，泥浆也被扔得到处都是，这些可贵的材料慢慢地就埋到地下变成了废物，这是砌第一层墙的情景。在砌第二层墙时，这个工区已经实行班组经济核算了，工人们利用休息的时间，一次就从地下挖出了两千多块砖。砌砖时，泥浆掉在地上了，马上刮起来再用。这个工区流传着这样一种说法：“一样的砖，同样的工人去使用它，却有两样的命运，一种是任意抛在地上，任人践踏；另一种是把残缺不全的砖修好，整整齐齐地砌在墙上，看起来又结实又美观。”这种节约的意义，不单是六个月里节省了近百吨钢材、七百四十多立方公尺木材、两千七百多吨水泥，更重要的是把这种节约精神贯穿在每一件工作中了！在拖拉机厂的工地上，随时随地都能碰到这样的事：钢筋接焊已改为对焊、把大件钢筋混凝土工作物上的吊环改用钢丝提吊、许多用过四五次的模板被妥善地保存起来下次再用。节约工作每时每刻都在持续着。
    推行班组经济核算的目的是要降低成本，而成本又是和企业中的一切工作，如工程质量好坏、劳动力使用上的节省或浪费、原材料消耗量的大小等等相联系的。推行班组经济核算的结果，全面地改进了各项工作。只有在这种情况下，经常厉行节约才有可能。在洛阳工程局的各个工地上，各个班组通过班组经济核算，了解到保证工程质量在节约中的重要意义，也了解到要想保证工程质量，必须提高技术。因此，工人们把推广班组经济核算比之为提高技术的大门。这个大门一开，人人都想提高技术，一批一批的先进工人走进了这个大门。原来是徒工的一下变成了熟练工人，原来技术低的工人提高了技术。工人们一遇到困难，就开动脑筋找窍门，推广先进经验，克服了过去一有运动就提高劳动强度的做法。这时，工会尽力设法保证工人在技术上不断进步，在每旬、每月检查评比时，除了比比计划是否先进外，同时要比比施工方法先进不先进，两方面都先进的才能成为先进小组。工会通过这个方法，把职工的劳动热情引上学习和提高技术的宽阔的道路。从去年1月到9月，工人共提出合理化建议两千四百八十多件，被采纳的将近一千件。这增加了工人学习、提高技术的信心。陆兴帮油漆小组试图节省桐油，就学习加石灰水的先进经验。开始总是不如意，但他们并不灰心，终于试验成功，节约一百六十多公斤桐油。工人们对于老一套的加班加点完成任务的方法，已不感兴趣了。一○四工区季富昌小组为了超额完成任务，就加班加点，这个小组虽然超额完成了任务，但是，工人们不评他们为先进小组。一○二工区李谒乐竹工小组，开始怕技术不行达不到定额，现在，全组工人都由不熟练的工人变成掌握了本行技术的工人。在这个过程中，技术人员也动起来了。不管哪一项节约材料的先进措施，都经过材料试验所的严格鉴定，这就保证了工程质量。
    班组经济核算推行得愈广、愈有成效，群众社会主义觉悟愈高，上下左右之间自然地形成了一种互相监督、互相帮助的风气。原来一○五工区杨文祥小组每月能完成任务，质量不好；徐洪根小组质量虽好，就是不能完成任务。这两个小组订了互助合同，彼此竞赛。结果，这两个小组都超额50％以上完成了任务，质量也提高了。
    过去一○二工区成本结算工作不正确，去年年初一个月就漏算了七万元，影响了经济核算工作。经过工区经济活动分析委员会的批评和督促，采用联系合同的办法，改进了成本核算工作。现在，月月成本结算都很正确。过去不管是科室也好，工段、工区也好，一搞竞赛，特别是节约竞赛，工人总是闹得很热烈，而科室人员却冷清清，工长、段长、工区主任也不很紧张。实行班组经济核算以后，工人每天跟在后面要任务单。要发任务单，一套工作都跟着来了：限额领料啦，成本核算啦等等，许多问题都得解决。要解决这些问题，工长、工段、工区也都要实行经济核算，大家都要有经济核算观点。工程局推行班组经济核算以后，接着就搞起了工长、工段、工区的经济核算。科室发动了两种竞赛，一种是同业务竞赛，另一种是联系合同，90％的科室订了先进指标。生产、技术供应，财务会计等七个科室订了联系合同，保证深入现场，具体解决问题。
    有人告诉我们，拖拉机厂的工地，可以称作文明工地，我们不大相信，但一件偶然发生的事，给这个问题作了答案。有一天，一个工程师领我们参观拖拉机厂，他看见我们穿了布鞋，好心地警告我们：“当心！说不定什么地方会跑出一个钉子来扎了脚。”但是，我们走过了许多地方，也没有发现一个钉子。事后我们才知道这位工程师好久没有到工地来，现实已经跑到他的前面去了。
