Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, January 5th. Peoples of all nationalities in the Honghe Hani Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province spent the first three days of the New Year in revelry, celebrating the third anniversary of the establishment of the autonomous region and the completion of land reform through peaceful consultation.

　　On New Year's Day morning, on the roads leading to the new street of Shuifulong, the capital of the autonomous region, people of all nationalities, dressed in festive costumes, holding red flags and beating gongs, poured in from all directions. Yao hunters from the high and cold mountainous areas came carrying strong crossbows and Ming Dynasty matchlock guns; Miao girls wearing pleated skirts adorned with silver bells also came. The Kucong people, who had been hunting in the primeval forests for a long time and only settled down last year, also came, as did the Dai girls wearing black skirts and the young men carrying gourd-shaped lutes from Mengla Dam. More than 10,000 people gathered in the square of the new street.

　　The celebration meeting for the third anniversary of the establishment of the autonomous region began amidst the sound of firecrackers. Li Chengxiang (Hani nationality), Chairman of the Autonomous Region, reported on the achievements of ethnic work over the past three years. Lu Yi, Secretary of the Honghe Border Work Committee of the Communist Party of China, also spoke, emphasizing that after the completion of land reform through peaceful consultation throughout the region, people of all nationalities will fully develop production in an all-round way and steadily carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

　　After the celebration meeting, folk artists from nine ethnic groups performed beautiful dances and orchestral music with unique ethnic styles on the rostrum. Finally, a dozen or so people dressed as lions jumped out from the crowd below the stage. The lions rolled incessantly in the smoke of firecrackers, and Li Chengxiang, Chairman of the Autonomous Region, hung colorful ribbons on them according to the customs of various ethnic groups. A film and dance party was also held that evening.

　　The next day, a traditional Hani and Yi wrestling competition was held in the square of the new street; a matchlock single-bullet shooting competition was held. The hunters took out gunpowder and lead pellets from their bright and clean cow horns, loaded them into their own beautifully decorated gun barrels, and then ignited the gunpowder to fire. Yao youth hunter Wang Diedou won first place.

　　On the 3rd, the basketball game, which had been going on for two days, continued. In the evening, folk artists performed for the people of all nationalities again.

　　During these three days, people rejoiced, danced and sang to their heart's content, experiencing exciting days and expressing the endless joy in their hearts. The enthusiastic Hani old folk singer Li Zhen led everyone in singing while holding a four-stringed lute:

　　The words in my heart are as many as the leaves on the trees;
　　The songs to be sung are as long as the Honghe River.
　　When I want to speak, my teeth don't hold back the wind;
　　When I want to sing, my voice is not good!
　　Oh, four-stringed lute!
　　Come and help me,
　　Help me sing moving songs,
　　Help me sing the words in my heart.

    红河哈尼族自治区各族人民
    庆祝自治区成立三周年
    新华社昆明5日电　云南省红河哈尼族自治区各族人民为庆祝自治区成立三周年和和平协商土地改革的完成，在狂欢中度过了新年的头三天。
    元旦清晨，在通往自治区首府水甫龙新街的各条大路上，穿着节日服装的各族人民，掌着红旗，敲着铓钹，从四面八方涌来。高寒山区的瑶族猎手们背着强弩明火枪来了；穿着系有银铃的百叶裙的苗族少女也来了。长期在原始森林中打猎，去年才定居下来的苦聪人也来了，勐喇坝的穿着黑裙的傣族姑娘和带着葫芦琴的小伙子们也来了。一万多人聚集在新街的广场上。
    自治区成立三周年庆祝大会在鞭炮声中开始。自治区主席李呈祥（哈尼族）在会上报告了三年来民族工作的成就。中共红河边疆工作委员会书记陆毅也讲了话，他着重指出，全区以和平协商的方式完成土地改革以后，各族人民将全力地全面发展生产，稳步地开展互助合作运动。
    庆祝大会结束，九个民族的民间艺人，在主席台上表演了优美的舞蹈和各族独特风格的管弦乐曲。最后，从台下人群里跳出十几头人扮的狮子来。狮子在鞭炮的硝烟里不住地翻滚，自治区主席李呈祥按各民族的风俗给他们挂了彩红。这天晚上还举行了电影和跳舞晚会。
    第二天，在新街的广场上，举行了哈尼族、彝族人民传统的摔跤比赛；举行了明火枪独弹射击比赛。猎手们从明光净亮的牛角里取出火药和铅丸，装在自己制造的装饰得十分漂亮的枪筒里，然后点火发射。瑶族青年猎手王跌豆获得了第一名。
    3日，已经进行了两天的篮球比赛还在继续进行。晚上，民间艺人们又为各族人民演出。
    在这三天里，人们尽情地欢乐、舞蹈和歌唱，人们在经历着激动人心的日子，抒发不尽心里的喜悦。热情的哈尼族老年歌人李真率抱着四弦琴歌唱起来：
    心里要说的话像树叶一样多；
    嘴上要唱的歌像红河水一样长。
    我要想说话，牙齿不关风；
    要想唱歌声音不好听啦！
    四弦琴啊！
    你快来帮忙，
    帮我唱出动人的歌，
    帮我唱出心头的话。
