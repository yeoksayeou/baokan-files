Xinhua News Agency, 20th. This year, Mishan, Hulin, Baoqing, and Raohe counties in Heilongjiang Province will reclaim three million mu of wasteland. Among them, 750,000 mu can yield a large amount of millet, soybeans, and corn this autumn. At the same time, large-scale livestock farms will be built in this area, with an annual capacity of raising 5,000 sows, 10,000 cattle, 10,000 horses, and 100,000 chickens.

The main force responsible for land reclamation - demobilized railway soldiers and officers - are braving the severe cold of minus 30 degrees in this area to build roads, bridges, channels, and prepare materials for construction, creating favorable conditions for this year's land reclamation and production. Last year, they had already reclaimed 750,000 mu of wasteland, which will be planted with spring wheat and soybeans in the spring.

In December last year, Minister of Agricultural Reclamation Wang Zhen and technicians from related agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy fields, as well as professors from universities, formed an inspection team and conducted more than a month of on-site investigations in this area. They have measured and classified the soil and land use in the reclamation area, and made detailed plans for production tasks, mechanical cultivation, and operation methods.

A responsible comrade from the Ministry of Agricultural Reclamation told reporters that the land in the Mishan and other four counties' reclamation areas is fertile. After the land reclamation plan is realized, the country will obtain a large amount of grain and livestock products. The winter in this area is long, the grass roots are thick, and there are many swamps, which need to be drained before reclamation can be carried out, and mechanical cultivation is also very difficult. However, the land reclamation heroes of the railway corps have the spirit of perseverance and fighting against difficulties. With the cooperation and support of water conservancy, machinery, and transportation departments in the future, even greater difficulties can be overcome.

    黑龙江省四个县今年将开荒三百万亩
    有七十五万亩今年秋后就可以收获大量粮食
    新华社20日讯　黑龙江省密山、虎林、宝清、饶河四县今年将开垦三百万亩荒地。其中有七十五万亩在今年秋天就可以收获大量的谷子、大豆和玉米。与此同时，这个地区还要兴建大型畜牧场，年内可饲养母猪五千头，牛一万头，马一万匹，鸡十万只。
    担负垦荒的主力军——复员的铁道兵军官和士兵们，冲破零下三十度的严寒正在这个地区修筑公路、架设桥梁、修建渠道和作备料建场等准备工作，为今年的垦荒和生产创造良好条件。他们去年已经开出了七十五万亩荒地，开春将种上春小麦和大豆。
    去年12月，农垦部部长王震和有关农林水利方面的技术员、高等院校的教授组成考察队曾到这个地区作过一个多月的实地调查，最近才回到北京。他们对垦区的土壤、土地利用作了测定和分类，对生产任务，机械耕作和操作方法也做出详尽的计划。
    农垦部负责同志对记者说，密山等四县垦区土地肥沃，垦荒计划实现以后，将使国家获得大量粮食和畜产品。这个地区冬季漫长，草根很厚，沼泽很多，需要把水排出后才能开垦，而且机械耕作也很困难。但铁道兵的垦荒英雄们具有坚毅不拔和困难搏斗的精神，加上今后水利、机械、运输部门的配合和支援，困难再大也是可以克服的。
