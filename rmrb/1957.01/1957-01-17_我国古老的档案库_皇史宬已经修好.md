Xinhua News Agency, 16th. China's oldest existing ancient archive, the Imperial Archives (Huangshicheng), has been completely renovated, restoring its original appearance of "stone chambers and golden caskets" as described in ancient books. Recently, local administrative archives of Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces from 300 years ago, transferred to China by the Soviet Union, and precious archives from the Ming and Qing dynasties preserved by the No. 1 Historical Archives of China have been put on display here.

Academic circles in Beijing and archivists from central government agencies who came to visit expressed great interest in this archive, built 423 years ago, and the newly displayed historical archives. The Imperial Archives is entirely constructed of brick and stone, without even a match-sized piece of wood, hence the name "stone chamber." Inside, there are 153 "golden caskets" that originally housed the sacred instructions and veritable records of feudal emperors.

The 17,081 volumes of archives from Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces, transferred to China by the Soviet Union last September, were taken away from Qiqihar by the Tsarist Russian army between 1900 and 1902. This batch of archives is now completely intact.

    我国古老的档案库——皇史宬已经修好
    据新华社16日讯　现在保留着的我国最早的一座古代档案库——皇史宬已经修缮完工，恢复了古书上所载的“石室金匮”的原貌。最近，在这里陈列了苏联移交我国的黑龙江、吉林两省三百年前的地方庶政档案和我国第一历史档案馆保藏的明、清两代珍贵的档案。
    来参观的北京学术界人士和中央机关档案工作者，对四百二十三年前建造的这座档案库和新陈列的历史档案很感兴趣。皇史宬全部是砖石结构，连火柴大小的木材都没有，所以称为“石室”，室内有一百五十三个“金匮”，原来藏封建帝王的圣训、实录。
    苏联在去年9月移交我国的黑龙江、吉林两省档案一万七千零八十一卷，是1900年到1902年间沙俄军队从齐齐哈尔运走的。现在，这批档案保管得完整无损。
