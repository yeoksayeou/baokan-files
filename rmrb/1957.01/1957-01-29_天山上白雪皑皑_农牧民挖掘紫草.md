Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 26th. The Tianshan Mountains are covered with snow, which is the season when gromwell grows vigorously. Farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in Suiding County of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture and Yanqi and other places in the Bayingoleng Mongol Autonomous Prefecture are braving the severe cold and treading on the snow to dig in large quantities. According to statistics from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Pharmaceutical Company, more than 200 tons have been excavated since the beginning of winter last year, and more than 100 tons have been transported to the interior to supply the needs of people in various places. Some of them have even been transported by plane to Shenyang and other places.

Xinjiang has a large output of gromwell with good quality, which is a good medicine for treating infantile measles. Since the beginning of winter last year, Shaanxi, Shenyang, Tongxian County in Hebei and other places have sent telegrams requesting a large supply from Xinjiang.

The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which is rich in medicinal materials, will increase its supply of medicinal materials to the interior from 580 tons last year to 1,170 tons this year. In addition to gromwell, fritillary bulbs, deer antlers, pilose antlers, and safflower, new varieties such as licorice and ox bile juice will also be added. This year's planned supply of medicinal materials within the autonomous region will also increase by 95% compared with last year, and the types of purchases will also increase.

    天山上白雪皑皑
    农牧民挖掘紫草
    新华社乌鲁木齐26日电　天山上白雪皑皑，正是紫草生长茁壮的季节，伊犁哈萨克族自治州绥定县和巴音郭楞蒙古族自治州焉耆等地的各族农牧民，正冒着严寒、踏着积雪上山大量挖掘。据新疆维吾尔自治区药材公司的统计，从去年入冬以来已挖掘了二百多吨，有一百多吨已经运往内地供应各地人民的需要，其中还有部分是用飞机运到沈阳等地的。
    新疆的紫草产量多、质量好，是治疗小儿麻疹的良药。去年入冬以来，陕西、沈阳、河北通县等地曾打电报来要求新疆大量供应。
    盛产药材的新疆维吾尔自治区，今年供应内地的药材将由去年的五百八十吨增加到一千一百七十吨，除紫草、贝母、鹿角、鹿茸、红花以外，并增加甘草、牛胆汁等新品种。今年计划供应自治区区内的药材总值也将比去年增加95％，收购的种类也有增加。
