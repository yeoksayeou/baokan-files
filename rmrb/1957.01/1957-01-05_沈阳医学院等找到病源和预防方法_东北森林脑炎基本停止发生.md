Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd. Shenyang Medical College and other units, after long-term research, have found the pathogen and prevention methods for forest encephalitis in Northeast China. After implementing these prevention methods, the local forest encephalitis has basically stopped occurring last year.

Forest encephalitis is a very serious infectious disease prevalent in the forest areas of Northeast China. The symptoms of this disease are paralysis, lethargy, convulsions, stiff neck, and speech disorders. The mortality rate of this disease is very high, and even if it is cured, there are often sequelae.

In order to find out the pathogen and prevent forest encephalitis, as early as 1952, relevant units in Northeast China formed a Forest Encephalitis Research Committee, with the China Medical University (now Shenyang Medical College) taking on the main research work. A logging site called "Mihunzhen" (Maze) in Jilin was selected as the experimental area. After several years of research and experiments, it has been proven that the forest tick, scientifically named "Forest Tick," contains the forest encephalitis virus, and it has also been proven that "Kangxin Blood Tick" and "Xiwage Tick" also contain this virus. After repeated in-depth investigations and research, medical workers have clarified the living habits of forest ticks and the way they transmit diseases, thus finding methods to prevent the disease by administering forest encephalitis vaccinations and preventing forest ticks from crawling onto people. They suggested that loggers should wear "five-tight clothing" (such as tightening cuffs, collars, etc.) and establish strict forest tick inspection stations to prevent workers from bringing ticks back to their dormitories. In addition, they also asked workers to wash clothes and apply medications to their bodies.

Due to the adoption of effective prevention measures, forest encephalitis had stopped occurring in the experimental area – "Mihunzhen" – by 1955. After other forest areas in Northeast China adopted these prevention methods, forest encephalitis had basically stopped occurring by 1956.

    沈阳医学院等找到病源和预防方法
    东北森林脑炎基本停止发生
    新华社沈阳2日电　沈阳医学院等单位经过长期研究已找出东北地区森林脑炎的病源和预防方法。实施这种预防方法以后，当地森林脑炎去年已基本上停止发生。
    森林脑炎是在东北林区流行的一种很厉害的传染病。这种病的症状是瘫痪、昏睡、惊厥、头部强直，言语发生障碍等，这种病的死亡率很高，就是治好了，也常常有后遗症。
    为了查明病源和预防森林脑炎病，早在1952年，东北各有关单位就组成了森林脑炎研究委员会，并由中国医科大学（即现在的沈阳医学院）担任主要研究工作。选定吉林一个名叫“迷魂阵”的伐木场做试验区域。经过这几年的研究和试验，证明学名叫“森林蜱”的森林壁虱含有森林脑炎病毒，并且证明“康辛血蜱”“西瓦革蜱”也含有这种病毒。医学工作者们经过反复的深入调查研究，已弄清森林壁虱的生活习性和它传染疾病的方式，因而找出了用打森林脑炎预防针和避免森林壁虱爬到人身上的方法来预防。他们建议伐木工人要穿“五紧服”（如束紧袖口、领口等）并建立严格的森林壁虱检查站等，以免工人把壁虱带回宿舍去，另外还叫工人用药物洗衣服和涂抹身体。
    由于采取了有效的预防办法，森林脑炎在试验地区——“迷魂阵”到1955年已停止发生了。东北其他林区采用了这些预防办法后，到1956年森林脑炎也基本上停止发生了。
