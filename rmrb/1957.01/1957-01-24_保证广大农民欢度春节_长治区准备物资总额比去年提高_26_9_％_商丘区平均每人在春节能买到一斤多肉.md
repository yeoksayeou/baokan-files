    Guaranteeing a Happy Spring Festival for the Broad Masses of Peasants
    Changzhi District Prepares Materials with a Total Value 26.9% Higher Than Last Year
    Shangqiu District: An Average of More Than One Jin of Meat Available per Person for the Spring Festival
    (Our Report) In Shanxi's Changzhi Special District, supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties are actively preparing materials to ensure a happy Spring Festival for the broad masses of peasants. According to incomplete statistics from ten counties including Lu'an and Changzi, a total of 488,870 jin of twenty-three kinds of non-staple foods, such as dried black dates, kelp, dried shrimp, and scallions, have been prepared; and 681,950 jin of eleven kinds of non-staple foods, such as black sauce, noodles, sesame candy, vinegar, and bean starch sheets, have been processed. The total value is 26.9% higher than the actual supply during last year's Spring Festival.
    In order to meet the needs of the peasant masses during the Spring Festival as much as possible, many county supply and marketing cooperatives have sent purchasing agents to other places to make purchases based on survey data. For example, the Yangcheng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased more than 1,300 jin of oranges, red dates, and agar-agar from other places, as well as more than 7,200 jin of pork, chili sauce, shrimp chili sauce, sesame chili sauce, and spicy powder. At the same time, they are actively organizing the processing of non-staple foods. For example, in addition to allowing the twenty-five flour mills, thirty-four oil mills, and sixty-six tofu workshops independently organized by agricultural cooperatives throughout the county to process and exchange goods, the Xiangyuan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also organized some flour mills, oil mills, and tofu workshops to expand processing capacity, processing grain products and oil for the state or exchanging finished products for raw materials, to compensate for the inadequacy of peasants' own processing. (Che Xi, Liu Jinshui)
    (Our Report) The grass-roots supply and marketing cooperatives in Henan's Shangqiu Special District have prepared relatively sufficient materials to supply the needs of farmers during the Spring Festival. According to statistics, the district has prepared more than 62,900 jin of various kinds of fish, more than 539,700 jin of sugar, and more than 938,000 jin of pastries. Together with more than thirty other major commodities, the total value reaches as much as 5.36 million yuan.
    In order to meet the masses' need for meat during the festival as much as possible, in addition to the state-owned commercial sector preparing to slaughter 14,800 live pigs, local supply and marketing cooperatives plan to slaughter 5,500 live pigs. At the same time, the masses will slaughter and consume approximately 77,000 live pigs themselves. In addition, state-owned commercial enterprises plan to slaughter 2,090 head of beef cattle and 6,200 sheep. The above totals 8,100,400 jin of pork, beef, and mutton, with an average of one jin and three liang of meat available per person before and after the Spring Festival.
    In preparing materials for the Spring Festival, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have reversed the past practice of blindly purchasing from other places "far and wide" and have paid attention to developing local sources of goods.
    In order to do a good job in supplying, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have also determined that all areas without state-owned companies supplying meat will be the responsibility of the supply and marketing cooperatives.

    保证广大农民欢度春节
    长治区准备物资总额比去年提高26.9％
    商丘区平均每人在春节能买到一斤多肉
    本报讯　山西长治专区各县供销合作社积极准备物资，保证广大农民欢度春节。据潞安、长子等十个县的不完全统计，已备妥黑枣、海带、虾皮、大葱等二十三种副食品共计四十八万八千八百七十斤；并加工出黑酱、挂面、芝麻糖、醋、粉皮等十一种副食品六十八万一千九百五十斤。总值比去年春节实际供应总额提高26.9％。
    为了尽量满足农民群众在春节期间的需要，不少县供销社根据调查的情况，派出采购员到外地进行采购。如阳城县供销社，就从外地购回桔子、红枣、石花菜等一千三百多斤，猪肉、辣酱、虾米辣酱、芝麻辣酱、香辣粉等七千二百余斤。同时，还积极组织加工副食品。如襄垣县供销社除对全县农业社自行组织的二十五座粉坊、三十四座油坊、六十六座豆腐坊任其加工互换外，为了扩大加工能力，又组织起一些粉坊、油坊、豆腐坊，给国家加工粮食制品和油料，或以成品换原料的办法，来弥补农民自己加工的不足。（车溪、刘金水）
    本报讯　河南商丘专区各基层供销合作社，已准备了比较充足的物资，供应农民在春节期间的需要。据统计，全区已准备各种鱼六万二千九百多斤、食糖五十三万九千七百多斤、点心九十三万八千多斤。连同其它三十多种主要商品，总值共达五百三十六万元之多。
    为了尽可能地满足群众在节日对肉类的需要，全专区除国营商业准备宰杀活猪一万四千八百头外，各地供销社还计划宰杀活猪五千五百头。同时，群众自宰自食的活猪，也有七万七千头左右。另外，国营商业准备宰杀菜牛二千零九十头、羊六千二百头。以上共计可供应猪、牛、羊肉八百一十万零四千多斤，平均每人在春节前后可买肉一斤三两。
    在准备春节物资工作中，各地供销合作社扭转了过去“舍近求远”盲目到外地采购的做法，注意开辟了地方货源。
    为了做好供应工作，各地供销社还确定凡是无国营公司供应肉类的地区，都由供销社负责供应。
