Xinhua News Agency, 5th. After sorting out 320 kinds of reports issued by the Ministry of Commerce and its subordinate general companies, the Ministry decided to abolish 139 of them from this year, retaining 181. For example, the price department originally had 24 kinds of reports, but only retained 4; the finance department had 51 kinds, but only retained 13; the expense department had 28 kinds, but only retained 8. The retained reports have also been simplified to a certain extent.

Among the abolished reports, some were already ineffective, some could be calculated by the leadership and did not need to be filled out by lower levels, some could be resolved through typical investigations or one-time investigations without the need for universal or regular reporting, some had overlapping indicators or were even impossible to fill out, and some were overly demanding from the finance and banking departments, which the commercial departments had not studied in detail before arranging for their completion.

    商业部精简大批报表
    新华社5日讯　商业部在清理了本部和所属各个总公司颁发的三百二十种报表以后，决定从今年起废止其中的一百三十九种，保留一百八十一种。例如物价部门原有报表二十四种，只保留四种；财务部门五十一种，只保留十三种；费用部门二十八种，只保留八种。对保留下来的报表也作了一定程度的简化。
    被废除的报表中，有的是早已失去作用的，有的是领导部门可以计算出来而不需要下级填报的，有的是可以经过典型调查或一次性调查就可以解决而不必普遍填报或定期填报的，有的是指标项目互相重复甚至是根本无法填报的，还有一些是财政和银行部门要求过繁而商业部门也没有详细研究就布置填报的。
