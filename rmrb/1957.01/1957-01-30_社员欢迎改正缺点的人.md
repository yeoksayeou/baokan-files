    Commune Members Welcome Those Who Correct Their Mistakes
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Shi Zhengzhang

    Gong Jiazan is the deputy director of the Matang Agricultural Cooperative in Wuhu County, Anhui Province. The commune members had many opinions about his leadership style. At the end of last year, during the democratic rectification of the commune, Gong Jiazan made a public self-criticism of his shortcomings at the commune members' representative meeting and received everyone's understanding. Later, in the re-election of the commune management committee, he received the most votes among the four elected deputy directors. The commune members all said: "No one is without mistakes. If one can correct their mistakes, we will trust him."

    Gong Jiazan is an active and hardworking person, but he doesn't quite believe in the power and wisdom of the masses, and compulsory orders often occur in his work. Last year, the task assigned by the higher authorities to plant double-cropping rice was very urgent. In order to complete the task, even though the season was more than half a month late, he still forced the commune members to plant late rice at night with torches. The deputy captain of the production team, Chen Changxian, raised an objection, saying that it was too late in the season and that planting it would probably not yield a harvest. He refused Chen Changxian's opinion with words such as insubordination and disciplinary action. As a result, more than seven mu of rice were planted overnight, but in the end, only a few dan of grass were harvested, and the commune members were very dissatisfied.

    Gong Jiazan once believed: "Now that we have a large commune, things are organized. Just find the cadres of the production team, move your mouth, and give orders," therefore, his work was not thorough enough.

    After the democratic rectification began, the Party branch talked to Gong Jiazan and asked him to make a self-criticism of his shortcomings at the commune members' representative meeting. At first, he couldn't understand it. He thought that he had worked hard for a year, but ended up with shortcomings all over him, which was really unrewarding. At the same time, he was afraid of losing face and prestige by making a public self-criticism. In response to this situation, the Party branch then organized the study of the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Party and the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on several specific issues in the autumn harvest distribution of agricultural cooperatives. After that, Gong Jiazan tossed and turned for several nights and couldn't sleep. Through the study of these documents, he further recognized his shortcomings and the correct attitude to take towards them. He thought: I was a hired hand and suffered all kinds of exploitation. After liberation, I was given land, got a wife, and had children. Under the cultivation of the Party, my awareness was raised, and I joined the Communist Party. The masses trust me and elected me as the deputy director of the large commune. Now that I have shortcomings and mistakes, can I not dare to admit them boldly? He also thought of what Comrade Deng Xiaoping said in his report on revising the Party Constitution: "Pride, arrogance, recklessness, being self-clever, not consulting with the masses, imposing one's own opinions on others, and insisting on errors for the sake of one's own prestige are fundamentally incompatible with the Party's mass line." He felt that these words were as if they were directed at him.

    After repeated consideration and the help of the Party branch, Gong Jiazan finally criticized and examined his shortcomings in his work to the commune members' representatives, and expressed that he would definitely integrate with the commune members in the future, listen to their opinions, and do a good job in the commune's production. After he examined his shortcomings, the commune members were very satisfied. They believed that Gong Jiazan was willing to work hard and wanted to run the commune well, but his work methods were not correct. Some said that in the past, suggestions were not accepted, but now he can make a public self-criticism, and the commune will definitely be run better in the future.

    After the rectification was over, Gong Jiazan completely changed. He worked alongside the commune members and went to the commune members' homes at night to visit and help organize sideline occupations. The commune members all said: "This is our good director." Gong Jiazan himself also felt relaxed and happy. He said: "Now the commune members are much warmer to me than before. When the commune members have problems, they report them to me, and they dare to express their opinions."

    社员欢迎改正缺点的人
    新华社记者　石正章
    龚家赞是安徽省芜湖县马塘农业社的副主任，社员对他的领导作风有很多意见。去年年底，这个农业社民主整社的时候，龚家赞在社员代表大会上把自己的缺点公开作了检讨，得到了大家的谅解。后来改选社务管理委员会，四个当选的副主任中，算他得的选票最多。社员们都说：一个人不能没有错，知错能改，我们就相信他。
    龚家赞是个积极肯干的人，可是不大相信群众的力量和智慧，工作中常常发生强迫命令的现象。去年上级布置的种双季稻的任务很紧，他为了完成任务，季节过了半个多月了，还强迫社员晚上打起火把来栽晚稻。生产队副队长陈昌先提出意见，说季节太晚，种下恐怕收不到，他就以不服从领导要以纪律处分等话来拒绝陈昌先的意见。结果一夜种了七亩多稻，到后来只割了几担草，社员非常不满。
    龚家赞曾经认为：“办了大社，做事有组织了，找找生产队的干部，动动嘴，指挥指挥就行了”，因此，工作上不够深入。
    民主整社开始后，党支部就找龚家赞谈话，要他把自己的缺点在社员代表大会上作检查。开始时他思想不通，认为辛辛苦苦地干了一年，还落得满身缺点，真是吃力不讨好；同时又怕公开检查丢面子，失掉威信。针对这种情况，党支部接着又组织学习了党的第八次全国代表大会文件和中共中央、国务院关于农业社秋收分配中若干具体问题的指示等文件，此后龚家赞一连几夜都翻来复去睡不着。通过这些文件的学习使他进一步认识了自己的缺点和对待缺点的正确态度。他想：我是个打长工的底子，受尽了剥削。解放后，分了田，讨了老婆，生了孩子，在党的培养下，提高了觉悟，加入了共产党，群众相信我，选我当大社副主任，现在有缺点有错误不敢大胆承认吗？他又想到邓小平同志关于修改党的章程的报告中说的话：“骄傲，专横，鲁莽，自作聪明，不同群众商量，把自己的意见强加于人，为了自己的威信而坚持错误，是同党的群众路线根本不相容的。”他觉得这几句话就好像是指着自己讲的。
    经过再三考虑和党支部的帮助，龚家赞终于向社员代表检查和批判了自己工作中的缺点，并且表示今后一定和社员打成一片，倾听社员的意见，搞好社里的生产。他检查过缺点以后，社员都很满意，认为龚家赞工作是肯吃苦的，也是想要把社办好的，就是工作方法不对头。有的说，过去提意见不接受，现在能公开检讨，以后社一定能办得更好。
    整社结束以后，龚家赞完全变了样了。他和社员一道生产，晚上深入到社员家里去访问，帮助组织开展副业。社员们都说：这才是我们的好主任。龚家赞自己也觉得轻松愉快了。他说：“现在社员见到我比以前亲热多了，社员一有问题就向我反映，有意见也敢提了。”
