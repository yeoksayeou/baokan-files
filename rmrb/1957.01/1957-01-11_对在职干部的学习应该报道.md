    Learning for Cadres On the Job Should Be Reported

    Since your newspaper expanded its format, it has added a lot of content. But I feel that one thing is still lacking, which is that there is very little reporting on the political theory learning of cadres on the job. I think that the political theory learning of cadres on the job is also an important task, and your newspaper needs to report and guide it, which will help the Party to cultivate cadres. It would be best to open a column to regularly publish the dynamics and experience introductions of political theory learning by cadres on the job. (Lu Yinyue, Huainan Winery, Anhui)

    对在职干部的学习应该报道
    你报扩大版面后在内容上增加了不少东西。但我感到还缺少一个内容，就是对在职干部的政治理论学习情况很少报道。我想，在职干部的政治理论学习也是一个重要的工作，你报有必要进行报道和指导，这对党培养干部将有所帮助。最好是开辟一个专栏，经常刊登在职干部的政治理论学习的动态和经验介绍。（安徽淮南酒厂　陆荫岳）
