    The Aiguo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ju County, Shandong Province, set its production targets too high last year. It also excessively emphasized increasing the planting of high-yield crops, neglecting the production of minor grains essential for the daily lives of cooperative members. Naturally, the cooperative members were dissatisfied. Comrade Lü Hongbin, the cooperative's director, said, "The thousand-plus households have entrusted their livelihoods to the cooperative committee. If we don't listen to the opinions of the members and fail to improve production, we can't blame the members for complaining about us."
    Formulating this year's production plan was different from last year. Before drafting the plan, members of the cooperative committee visited each production team separately. The members all expressed their opinions on the plan. One said: last year, too little millet was planted; there wasn't even enough for gruel, what should the elderly and women who had just given birth eat? Another said: last year, finger millet and jute were also planted too little; there wasn't even enough to make ropes for the cattle. At the discussion meeting held in the Thirty-Second Team, many members said, "The people in our team know the soil conditions of our team best, and we won't be wrong about what crops are suitable to grow. If the production plan is discussed and formulated by the team, we guarantee that we can complete it!"
    Based on the needs of the state and the needs of the cooperative members, the Aiguo Agricultural Cooperative determined the crop planting plan. Initially, some people worried that if the plan was handed over to the members for discussion, the planting area for high-yield crops would not meet the state's requirements. What was the result? The planting area for high-yield crops exceeded the original requirements. In addition, the plan, in accordance with local soil and other conditions, decided to increase the planting of some millet, sorghum, finger millet, foxtail millet, broomcorn millet, and other miscellaneous grains. In this year's production plan, sideline occupations also occupied their proper place. This preliminary draft of the plan received close attention from the vast majority of cooperative members, and they put forward many suggestions around the realization of the production plan.
    Only a plan that fully reflects the opinions and requirements of the cooperative members can receive their full support. Only a plan for whose realization all members are willing to devote all their strength and wisdom is not empty talk, and is truly a powerful weapon to guide production.

    把生产计划交给群众
    山东省莒县爱国农业生产合作社去年把生产指标订得太高了，而且过分地强调了增种高产作物，忽视了社员们过日子少不了的小杂粮的生产。社员们当然不满意。合作社社长吕鸿宾同志说：“上千户社员把家业交给了社委会，我们不能听取社员的意见，把生产搞好，这就不能怪社员们埋怨我们。”
    制订今年生产计划，可不像去年那样了。订计划之前，社委会委员们分头到各个生产队去访问。社员都对计划问题发表了意见。这个说：去年谷子种的太少，连粘粥汤也不够喝的，老年人和生孩子的妇女吃什么？那个说：去年穇子、黄麻也种少了，连做牛套绳子都不够用。在第三十二队召开的座谈会上，许多社员都说：“本队人对于本队的土质条件摸的最清楚，适合种什么庄稼错不了。生产计划要是让队里讨论、制订，我们保证能完成！”
    根据国家的需要和社员的需要，爱国农业社确定了作物种植计划。原先有人担心把计划交给社员讨论，高产作物种植面积达不到国家的要求。结果呢？高产作物种植面积却超过了原定的要求。另外，计划还按照本地土壤等条件，决定增种一部分谷子、高粱、穇子、黍子、稷子等杂粮。在今年的生产计划里，副业也占了应有的地位。这个计划初步方案受到广大社员的密切关怀，社员们围绕着实现生产计划提出了很多建议。
    只有充分反映了社员群众的意见和要求的计划，才能受到社员群众的全力支持；只有全体社员都愿意为它的实现而付出全部力量和智慧的计划，才不是纸上谈兵，才真正是指导生产的有力武器。
