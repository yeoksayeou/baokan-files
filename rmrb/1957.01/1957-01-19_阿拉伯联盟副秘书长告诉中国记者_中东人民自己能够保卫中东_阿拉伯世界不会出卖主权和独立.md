Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 18th: The Deputy Secretary-General of the Arab League, Dr. Bella Mah, told Chinese journalists here on the 17th that it is incorrect for the United States to call the Arab world a vacuum, because it is inhabited by approximately fifty million Arab people, and no one is better able to defend the Middle East than the people who live in the Middle East themselves."

Dr. Bella Mah received the Chinese journalists delegation at his office. He spoke to the Chinese journalists about Eisenhower's Middle East plan, saying that Arab countries are carefully studying Eisenhower's plan and will respond soon.

He pointed out that the Arab world will certainly not accept any plan that infringes upon its independence and sovereignty, and it will not sell its independence no matter how much money is offered. He said that if this plan meets the above conditions and helps the Arab world and the whole world establish peace, freedom, and justice, we will welcome it. Otherwise, we will not accept it.

When talking about Eisenhower's plan's so-called "communist threat," Dr. Bella Mah said that Eisenhower's Middle East plan made no mention whatsoever of threats from Britain and France.

Dr. Bella Mah also explained in detail the role played by the Arab League in promoting Arab unity.

    阿拉伯联盟副秘书长告诉中国记者
    中东人民自己能够保卫中东
    阿拉伯世界不会出卖主权和独立
    新华社开罗18日电　阿拉伯联盟副秘书长贝拉马博士17日在这里对中国的新闻工作者说，美国“把阿拉伯世界叫作真空是不对的，因为这里住居着大约五千万阿拉伯人民，再没有任何人可以比住在中东的人民自己更能够保卫中东了。”
    贝拉马博士在他的办公处接见了中国新闻工作者代表团。他向中国记者们谈到艾森豪威尔的中东计划说，阿拉伯国家正在仔细地研究艾森豪威尔的计划，不久就会作出答复。
    他指出：阿拉伯世界当然不会接受任何触犯它的独立和主权的计划，不管出多少钱，它也不会出卖它的独立。他说，如果这个计划符合上述这些条件，并且有助于阿拉伯世界和全世界建立和平、自由和正义的话，我们就欢迎它。否则，我们就不会接受它。
    在谈到艾森豪威尔计划的所谓“共产主义威胁”的说法的时候，贝拉马博士说，艾森豪威尔的中东计划丝毫没有提到来自英法的威胁。
    贝拉马博士还详细解释了阿拉伯联盟在促进阿拉伯团结方面所起的作用。
