Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 21st:

	To assist China in constructing 211 enterprises, factories and design departments throughout the Soviet Union are continuously providing China with various machines, blueprints, and technical documents.

	The Podolsk Machine-Building Plant in the Moscow region has already manufactured and shipped over 2,500 tons of complex equipment for Chinese oil refineries. Not long ago, the machine-building workers of Podolsk also shipped three waste heat boilers to a nitrogen fertilizer plant in China. Now, they are preparing to manufacture exhaust fans and other equipment for power plants in Beijing, Wuhan, Jilin, and other places. In Moscow, the Likhachev Automobile Factory, which has been assisting China in construction, recently completed a giant frame press with a pressure of 3,500 tons for the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Plant one month ahead of schedule. This is the first time such a giant press has been manufactured in the Soviet Union. It is as tall as a five-story building, and at least thirteen to fourteen specially lengthened open railway cars are needed to transport it.

	Many industrial enterprises in Leningrad are manufacturing orders for Chinese factories. The Electrical Equipment Factory here shipped 100 powerful electric motors to China last year, and a batch of three new types of wire drawing machines made by the hardware factory for their Chinese counterparts, each capable of drawing 350 to 550 meters of wire per minute, are being shipped.

	In Dnepropetrovsk, the Artem Factory is manufacturing a universal paper machine for a Chinese paper mill. This machine can produce 400 meters per minute of packaging paper and cement bag paper with a width of 4.2 meters, and automates the entire paper-making process. The Debaltseve Factory is manufacturing a new type of mining machine for a Chinese open-pit iron mine, which requires only one worker to operate and has a workload per hour equivalent to the labor of more than 200 workers. In addition, the Dnepropetrovsk Factory, which produces steelmaking equipment, is also manufacturing machines for the Anshan Iron and Steel Company that can clean and oil ingot molds. Recently, the Design Institute of the Coal Industry Enterprise Construction Department of the Ukrainian Republic has designed and sent construction drawings for the Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant in Henan. Prior to this, it also sent technical documents for the construction of workshops, warehouse equipment, residential buildings, and welfare facilities.

    帮助我国建设二百一十一项企业
    苏联各地工厂赶制中国订货
    新华社莫斯科21日电　苏联各地工厂和设计部门为了帮助中国建设二百一十一项企业，正在源源不断地为中国提供各种机器、图样和技术文件。
    莫斯科州的波多尔斯克机器制造厂已经为中国的炼油工厂制成和运出了共两千五百多吨的复杂装置。不久以前，波多尔斯克的机器制造工人还为中国一家氮肥厂运走了三个余热锅炉。现在，他们又在准备为北京、武汉、吉林等地的发电厂制造排风机和其他装备。在莫斯科市，一直在帮助中国建设的利哈乔夫汽车工厂最近提前一个月为长春的第一汽车制造厂制成了一台压力为三千五百吨的巨型车架压床。在苏联，还是头一次制造这种巨型的压床，它有五层楼房那么高，为了把它运走至少需要十三到十四辆特别延长的火车敞车。
    列宁格勒的许多工业企业都在为中国的工厂制造订货。这里的电力电工器材工厂去年就向中国运走了一百台强大的电动机，五金工厂为中国的同行制成的一批每台每分钟能拉丝三百五十到五百五十公尺的三种新型拉丝机正在起运。
    在第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克，阿尔捷姆工厂正在为中国一家造纸厂制造万能抄纸机。这台机器每分钟可以生产四百公尺纸幅为四点二公尺的包装纸和水泥袋用纸，而且使造纸的整个生产过程都自动化了。杰巴尔切夫斯克工厂正在为中国一个露天铁矿制造一种新型矿山用机器，这种机器只需一个工人操使，每台每小时的工作量等于二百多名工人的劳动量。此外，生产炼钢装备的第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克工厂还在为鞍山钢铁公司制造可以清整钢锭模和给钢锭模上油用的机器。最近，乌克兰共和国采煤工业企业建设部设计院已经为河南洛阳矿山机器厂设计好和寄去了建设施工图。在这以前，它还寄去了一些建设车间、仓库设备、住宅和生活福利建筑物用的技术文件。
