    The United States Continues to Obstruct the Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue

    After the Eleventh United Nations General Assembly reconvened at the beginning of the year, the United States submitted a proposal to the UN General Assembly's Political Committee regarding the Korean issue, demanding the reaffirmation of the "basic principles" of the illegal resolutions on the Korean issue that the United States had manipulated the United Nations General Assembly to "pass" in the past, to realize the so-called nationwide elections in Korea under "United Nations supervision," and had already manipulated a majority to "pass" this proposal on the 8th.

    The so-called "basic principles" in the U.S. proposal are actually intended to obliterate the Korean people's national right to independently resolve the issue of national reunification, and to have the United States unilaterally handle the Korean issue in the name of the United Nations, so as to expand the current dark rule of the United States over southern Korea to the entire Korean peninsula. This absurd principle has long been proven to be completely unworkable and unsalable dead stock. The United States is now bringing it to the United Nations podium to peddle it again. This is clearly not for solving the problem, but only to continue to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and to use this to cause disputes and disrupt the atmosphere of the United Nations meetings in order to facilitate its conspiracy to promote the Cold War policy around the world.

    At the beginning of the discussion of the Korean issue, the United States also manipulated the voting machine of the Political Committee to unreasonably veto the suggestion made by India and supported by many countries, including the Soviet Union, to invite representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the discussion, and forcibly summoned the representatives of South Korea to the United Nations. This South Korean representative publicly clamored at the United Nations Political Committee meeting to "abolish" the Korean Armistice Agreement and restore the "freedom of action" of the Syngman Rhee army. This exposes the purpose of the United States in only allowing South Korean representatives to the United Nations, which is to use them to oppose the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    In the past year, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China have made great efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and maintain the Korean Armistice Agreement, but the United States has intensified its sabotage of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The United States not only stubbornly refused the suggestions put forward by Korea and China to convene a conference of relevant countries to discuss the peaceful reunification of Korea and other issues, but also unilaterally announced the termination of the inspection activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission at various designated ports, recklessly illegally transporting weapons and equipment to South Korea, and illegally expanding the Syngman Rhee army to thirty-one divisions. Recently, the Syngman Rhee clique has been clamoring about "marching north," precisely to cooperate with the United States' trick of keeping the Korean situation tense.

    However, the people of Korea and China are determined to maintain the Korean Armistice Agreement, and the Korean issue must and can only be resolved on the basis of respecting the national rights of the Korean people. Any unilateral resolutions made by the United States in the United Nations are illegal and invalid, and therefore can only be a waste of effort!

### 美国继续阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决

    美国继续阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决
    十一届联合国大会在年初复会以后，美国就向讨论朝鲜问题的联大政治委员会提出一项提案，要求重申美国过去操纵联合国大会“通过”的关于朝鲜问题非法决议的“基本原则”，实现在“联合国监督”下的所谓朝鲜全国选举，并已于8日操纵多数“通过”了这个提案。
    美国提案中的所谓“基本原则”，实际上就是想抹煞朝鲜人民自己解决祖国统一问题的民族权利，而由美国假借联合国名义独断地处理朝鲜问题，以便把目前美国对朝鲜南部的黑暗统治扩大到全朝鲜。这种荒谬原则早已被证明是完全行不通和卖不掉的死货。美国现在又把它搬到联合国讲坛上来叫卖一通，这显然并不是为了解决问题，而只是要继续阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，并借此引起争吵，扰乱联合国会议的气氛，以便利它在世界各地推行冷战政策的阴谋。
    在朝鲜问题的讨论开始时，美国还操纵了政治委员会的表决机器，无理地否决了由印度所提出、为苏联等许多国家所支持的邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加讨论的建议，并硬把南朝鲜的代表召唤到联合国。这个南朝鲜代表在联合国政治委员会会议上，公然叫嚣要“废除”朝鲜停战协定，恢复李承晚军队的“行动自由”。这就暴露了美国只让南朝鲜代表到联合国的目的，只是要利用它来反对和平解决朝鲜问题。
    在过去一年中，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国为了和平解决朝鲜问题和维护朝鲜停战协定，曾经作了很大的努力，但是美国却变本加厉地破坏朝鲜停战协定。美国不但顽固地拒绝朝、中两国提出的召开有关国家会议来协商解决朝鲜和平统一等问题的建议，而且还片面宣布停止了中立国监察委员会在各特定口岸的视察活动，肆无忌惮地向南朝鲜非法运入武器装备，把李承晚军队非法扩充到三十一个师。最近，李承晚集团又在大肆叫嚣要“向北挺进”，正是为了配合美国要使朝鲜局势继续紧张下去的把戏。
    但是，朝中两国人民决心维护朝鲜停战协定，朝鲜问题必须而且只能在尊重朝鲜人民的民族权利的基础上求得解决。美国在联合国搞的任何片面决议都是非法的和无效的，因此也只能是枉费心机！
