Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 27th: Winter production, centered on strengthening field management of overwintering crops and preparing for spring plowing, has already become a surge in the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives in Shaanxi Province.

Due to last year's bumper harvest, members of agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Shaanxi Province are particularly enthusiastic about winter production. In Qianxian, Lintong, Weinan, and five other counties in the Qinchuan area, many agricultural cooperatives have changed their habit of not applying fertilizer in winter, and have already top-dressed more than 1.89 million mu of wheat fields with fertilizer. From last winter to mid-January this year, Lantian County has top-dressed more than 300,000 mu of wheat fields, accounting for 83% of the county's total wheat field area. In Wugong County, a nationally renowned wheat high-yield county, many agricultural cooperatives have begun to top-dress wheat fields for the second time. Generally, agricultural cooperatives in the Qinchuan area with the necessary conditions have also irrigated wheat fields in a timely manner. The Weihe Canal, Luohe Canal, and three other large irrigation areas have irrigated more than 760,000 mu of wheat fields. Agricultural cooperatives in the Jinghe Canal irrigation area have completed 92% of their winter irrigation plan. In the Hanzhong area, more than half of the 1.73 million mu of wheat fields have been hoed once, and 250,000 mu of rapeseed have generally been thinned and top-dressed once. With the efforts of agricultural cooperatives in various places to grasp field management, the vast majority of wheat seedlings in the province are currently growing well.

Spring plowing preparations are also being intensified in agricultural cooperatives throughout Shaanxi Province. Agricultural cooperatives in more than 40 counties, including Xingping, Wugong, and Zhouzhi, have generally stockpiled enough seeds such as cotton for spring sowing. Agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Xi'an and nine counties, including Gaoling, Fuping, and Chengcheng, have accumulated 6.2 billion jin of fertilizer. Many agricultural cooperatives in Suide County have accumulated enough fertilizer for spring plowing. Agricultural cooperatives in many areas are actively building farmland water conservancy projects.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, January 26th: Farmers of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, who won a bumper harvest in the first year of cooperation, are now launching production activities to increase production even more this year.

Currently, from the Hulunbuir League in the northeast to the Hetao area of the Yellow River in the southwest, on the frozen fields, members of all ethnic groups are actively engaged in activities such as accumulating fertilizer and delivering manure, rolling the ground despite the freezing temperatures, digging wells and opening canals, improving the soil, and renovating livestock pens. By the end of last year, six banners and counties on the southern foothills of the Daqing Mountains had accumulated more than 1.85 million carts of manure and dug more than 840 wells. Among them, Tuoketuo County also improved more than 7,700 mu of soil and winter-irrigated more than 14,000 mu of farmland. In addition to rolling more than 31,000 mu of fields, members of Liangcheng County also built more than 90 canals. In the Ikezhao League, where there are more livestock, many agricultural cooperative members have also organized manure collection teams, built pigsties, and dug fertilizer cellars. The work of pulling soil to improve the soil, which is carried out every winter and spring in Hangjin Houqi in the Hetao area of the Yellow River, has now also begun universally.

Developing sideline production is an important winter production task for farmers of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia. Since the members of several banners and counties in the Jerim League and Zhaowuda League launched sideline activities such as transportation, weaving, sewing, collecting firewood, hunting, and operating tofu and oil mills, they have earned more than 12 million yuan by the beginning of January this year. In addition to using part of their sideline income to purchase daily necessities, members of Chifeng County have also added more than 200 carts, more than 5,000 head of livestock of all sizes, and more than 3,000 pigs. Shengtai Agricultural Cooperative in Liangcheng County unified the operation of sideline businesses such as oil mills, mills, and transportation, and assigned sideline businesses such as hunting, manure collection, firewood collection, and sewing to cooperative members for individual operation, earning more than 7,200 yuan by mid-December last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, January 27th: Winter production in the Yangtze River Delta region is very active. Currently, farmers are carrying out field management of summer-ripening crops. Rapeseed fields in Tongxiang, Chongde, Lin'an, Yuhang and other counties in Jiaxing Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, and in Suzhou and Songjiang Prefectures, Jiangsu Province, have generally been fertilized once, and some areas have been fertilized twice. Farmers are replanting some rapeseed fields due to frozen seedlings. Some agricultural cooperatives in Suzhou and Songjiang Prefectures have covered rapeseed fields with rice straw to prevent frozen seedlings. Currently, the more than 2 million mu of rapeseed in the Taihu Lake basin have grown several tender leaves and are mostly growing well.

Most of the wheat seedlings in this area have also been fertilized once, and the wheat seedlings have tillered and are growing vigorously, appearing a lush green.

The Yangtze River Delta, including Suzhou and Songjiang Prefectures in Jiangsu Province and Jiaxing Prefecture in Zhejiang Province, is a well-known high-yield grain area. Last autumn, this area planted 16 million mu of summer-ripening crops. In addition to strengthening the management of summer-ripening crops, farmers are also building water conservancy projects and accumulating fertilizer to create conditions for a bumper harvest of autumn crops this year. Farmers in Hengjing Township, Zhenze County, Suzhou Prefecture, have found seven sources of fertilizer and have now dredged more than 87,000 boats of mud and accumulated a large amount of manure, garbage, and other fertilizers. More than 60% of the base fertilizer used for the township's 24,000 mu of rice fields has been accumulated.

    在千里冰封的内蒙古原野　在秦岭南北　在长江三角洲
    奋力争取新的大丰收　冬季生产正形成热潮
    新华社西安27日电　以加强越冬作物田间管理和春耕准备为中心的冬季生产，已经在陕西省绝大部分农业社里形成热潮。
    由于去年获得丰收，陕西省各地农业社的社员在冬季生产中特别起劲。秦川地区的乾县、临潼、渭南等八个县，许多农业社改变冬季不施肥的习惯，目前已经给一百八十九万多亩麦田追施了肥料。蓝田县从去年冬天到今年1月中旬，追施过肥料的麦田已经有三十多万亩，占全县麦田总面积的83％。全国著名的小麦丰产县武功县，许多农业社已经开始给麦田第二次追施肥料。秦川地区一般有条件的农业社还及时给麦田灌了水。渭惠渠和洛惠渠等三个大灌溉区灌溉过的麦田有七十六万多亩。泾惠渠灌溉区的农业社已经完成冬季灌溉计划的92％。汉中专区一百七十三万亩麦田已经有半数以上锄过一次，二十五万亩油菜一般都间了一次苗和追施了一次肥料。在各地农业社抓紧田间管理的努力下，目前全省绝大部分麦苗生长良好。
    陕西省各地农业社的春耕准备工作也在加紧进行。兴平、武功、盩厔等四十多个县的农业社一般都储备够了春播所需的棉花等种子。西安市郊区和高陵、富平、澄城等九县的农业社已经积肥六十二亿斤。绥德县许多农业社已经积够了春耕中用的肥料。许多地区的农业社正在积极修筑农田水利工程。
    新华社呼和浩特26日电　在合作化第一年赢得大丰收的内蒙古自治区各族农民，现在又为今年更多地增产展开生产活动。
    目前，东北起呼伦贝尔盟，西南到黄河后套，在千里冰封的原野上，各族社员们积肥送粪，顶冻磙地，打井开渠，改良土壤和整修牲畜圈棚等活动，已经逐渐活跃起来。大青山南麓的六个旗、县到去年年底已积攒粪肥一百八十五万多车，打井八百四十多眼。其中托克托县还改良土壤七千七百多亩，冬浇农田一万四千多亩。凉城县的社员们除磙地三万一千多亩田外，还修筑了九十多道水渠。牲畜较多的伊克昭盟，许多农业社社员还组织了拾粪队，修盖猪圈，挖筑肥料窖。黄河后套杭锦后旗每年冬春的拉土——土壤改良工作，现在也普遍开始了。
    开展副业生产是内蒙古各族农民冬季的一项重要生产。哲里木盟和昭乌达盟几个旗、县的社员们，自从展开运输、编织、缝纫、打柴、打猎和豆腐场、油场等副业活动以来，到今年1月上旬已收入了一千二百多万元。赤峰县的社员们除用一部分副业收入购买生活用品外，还添置了二百多辆大车、五千多头大小牲畜和三千多口猪。凉城县胜天农业社，把开油场、磨场和运输等副业由社统一经营，把打猎、拾粪、打柴和缝纫等副业交社员个人经营，到去年12月中旬已收入七千二百多元。
    新华社杭州27日电　长江三角洲地区的冬季生产很活跃。当前，农民们正在进行夏熟作物的田间管理工作。浙江省嘉兴专区的桐乡、崇德、临安、余杭等县和江苏省苏州、松江两专区的油菜田，已经普遍施肥一次，部分地区施了二遍肥。有些油菜田因冻缺苗，农民们正在进行补种。苏州、松江两专区有些农业社已给油菜田盖上了稻草，防预冻苗。现在，太湖流域的二百多万亩油菜，已生长出好几个嫩叶，生长情况大部良好。
    这个地区的大部分麦苗也已经施肥一次，麦苗已经分蘖盘棵，一片旺绿。
    长江三角洲包括江苏省苏州、松江两专区和浙江省的嘉兴专区，是著名的粮食高产量地区。去年秋季这个地区插种的夏熟作物有一千六百万亩。现在农民除对夏熟作物加强管理外，还兴修水利、积肥，为今年秋季作物丰收创造条件。苏州专区震泽县横泾乡农民找出七种肥源，现已泥八万七千多船，积粪，垃圾等肥料很多，全乡二万四千多亩稻田所用的基肥已积好60％以上。
