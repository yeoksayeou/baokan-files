Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 14th: According to a Polish Press Agency report, Polish Council of Ministers Chairman Cyrankiewicz delivered a speech at a mass rally in Krakow on the 13th.

Chairman Cyrankiewicz first stated that, as a Krakow resident, he was particularly pleased to be able to come to Krakow with Premier Zhou Enlai and the entire Chinese government delegation after the talks in Warsaw. The most distinctive feature of this city is its connection to Poland's excellent traditions and centuries of culture, to the lives of the Polish people, and to the life of the new Poland.

Cyrankiewicz emphasized that the new Poland has not only abandoned any historical achievements, but has also developed the good and progressive aspects of our history under Polish conditions. I believe that the representatives of the Chinese people, with their rich ancient culture, are best able to understand this.

Chairman Cyrankiewicz said that among the many issues of great importance to China, Poland, and the entire international situation, some are of particular significance. The Polish people today gratefully see the support given by the Chinese people on the issue of the integrity of the Oder-Neisse border. The Polish people will never forget the support Premier Zhou Enlai expressed in 1954 during his visit to Poland for solutions to the German question that would prevent the resurgence of aggressive forces. We highly value this statement from the powerful 600 million Chinese people because we remember that it was German imperialism that launched two aggressions in the twentieth century, causing two terrible world wars and enormous material and spiritual losses, and Poland was one of the countries that suffered the most.

We Polish people wholeheartedly and fully support the just demand of the People's Republic of China to obtain its rightful seat in the United Nations and to return Taiwan to the People's Republic of China. From the point of view of moral principles and binding principles of international law, this demand is justified and legitimate.

Chairman Cyrankiewicz said that we know that contradictions exist in the world, and international life is still full of mistrust. It is precisely because of this situation that all peace-loving forces must be determined to take concerted action. We believe that the recent proposals put forward by the peace camp, and the recent proposals on disarmament put forward by the Soviet Union, can become an important step forward on the issue of European security. He said that Poland is fighting against all forms of national oppression and against imperialism.

We support the unity of socialist countries, and we believe that the best way to implement the international unity of socialist countries is for each socialist country to achieve its greatest development in accordance with its own historical traditions and national characteristics, with no country interfering in the affairs of other countries. At the same time, we are in favor of maintaining ties with all other countries, regardless of their internal systems, because internal systems are a matter for each country itself.

The Polish Council of Ministers Chairman pointed out that in Poland, twelve years after the people have come to power, Poland's democratic forces have brought the country the achievements it has been able to accomplish. He went on to say that, of course, we have indeed had mistakes and deviations, just as in the history of the international workers' movement, and we are experiencing difficulties. But it must be remembered that at no time in our past history has the productive forces ever been so developed. We are proud of our achievements. We are condemning the mistakes of the past and learning from them in order to eliminate the mistakes and move forward better and more wisely than in the past. We must all remember and pay attention that proper criticism of current state affairs should be constructive, and it should mobilize people to work better. We should not make any promises that cannot be fulfilled, and we should not think that the situation can be changed by some magic trick. This is the path that the Eighth Plenary Session pointed out to the whole country. The Eighth Plenary Session very resolutely emphasized that we want to build socialism in Poland, and we want to maintain good relations with socialist countries, relations based on the principles of mutual equality and freedom. Our talks with our Chinese friends have shown that they fully understand this, and this makes us very happy.

Cyrankiewicz finally said to the Chinese guests that we feel very strong when we receive you in Poland. This is not only due to our own achievements, but also because we feel a common strength. We believe that the more consolidated the unity of socialist countries, the stronger our country, People's Poland, will be.

    在克拉科夫群众大会上
    西伦凯维兹主席的讲话（摘要）
    波兰人民感激中国人民在奥得—尼斯边界完整的问题上所给予的支持。　波兰人衷心地和全力地支持人民中国取得它在联合国内应有地位的权利和把台湾归还中华人民共和国的要求。　社会主义国家的团结越巩固，我们的国家——人民波兰也将越有力量。
    新华社华沙14日电　据波兰通讯社报道，波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹13日在克拉科夫群众大会上的讲话。
    西伦凯维兹主席首先声明，作为一个克拉科夫人，他特别高兴在华沙会谈以后能够同周恩来总理和中国政府代表团全体人员一起来到克拉科夫，这个城市最显著的特点是它同波兰的优秀传统和许多世纪的文化联系着，同波兰人的生活、同新波兰的生活联系着。
    西伦凯维兹强调说，新波兰不仅没有抛弃历史上的任何成就，并且在波兰的条件下发展了我们历史上好的、进步的东西。我相信，有着丰富的古代文化的中国人民的代表最能够了解这一点。
    西伦凯维兹主席说，在对于中国、波兰和整个国际局势具有极大重要性的许多问题当中，有些是有着特殊意义的。波兰人民今天感激地看到中国人民在奥得—尼斯边界完整的问题上所给予的支持。波兰人民永远不会忘记，周恩来总理1954年到波兰的时候曾经对足以防止侵略力量再起的解决德国问题的办法所表示的支持。我们非常看重强大的六亿中国人民的这一声明，因为我们记得，正是德国帝国主义在二十世纪发动了两次侵略，造成了两次可怕的世界战争和巨大的物质和精神损失，而波兰是受到损失最重的国家之一。
    我们波兰人衷心地和全力地支持人民中国对于取得它在联合国内应有地位的权利和把台湾归还给中华人民共和国的正义要求，从道义的观点和具有约束力的国际法准则的观点来看，这种要求都是正当合法的。
    西伦凯维兹主席说，我们知道，世界上存在着矛盾，国际生活中仍然充满着不信任，正是由于这种情况，一切爱好和平的力量必须决心采取一致行动。我们认为，和平阵营最近提出的建议，苏联最近提出的关于裁军的建议，能够成为在欧洲安全问题上向前迈进的一个重要步骤。他说，波兰正为反对一切形式的民族压迫而斗争，正为反对帝国主义而斗争。
    我们支持社会主义国家的团结，而且我们认为，实行社会主义国家国际团结的最好的方法就是每一个社会主义国家按照自己的历史传统和民族特性取得最大的发展，任何一个国家不干涉其他国家的事务。同时，我们赞成同一切其他国家保持联系，不问它们的内部制度如何，因为内部制度是各国自己的事情。
    波兰部长会议主席指出，在波兰，在人民已经当权十二年以后，波兰的民主力量已经给国家带来了它所能完成的成就。他接着说，自然，我们确实有过错误、偏差，正像在国际工人运动历史上的情形一样，并且我们正在经历着困难。但是必须记住，在我们过去的任何一个历史时期，生产力都从来没有得到过这样的发展。我们为我们的成就而自豪。我们正在谴责过去所犯过的错误并且从中吸取教训，以便消除错误，比过去更好地更明智地向前迈进。我们大家必须记住和注意，对于目前国家事务的正当批评应该是建设性的，它应该动员人们更好地进行工作，我们不应该提出任何不能实现的诺言，我们不应该认为可以用什么魔技来改变局势。这就是八中全会向全国指出的道路。八中全会非常坚决地强调，我们要在波兰建设社会主义，我们要同社会主义国家保持良好关系，保持基于互相平等自由的原则的关系。我们同中国朋友的会谈已经表明，他们充分了解这一点，这使我们感到非常高兴。
    西伦凯维兹最后对中国客人们说，我们在波兰接待你们的时候，感到自己很有力量。这不仅是由于我们自己的成就，并且也是由于我们感到共同的力量。我们相信，社会主义国家的团结越巩固，我们的国家——人民波兰也将越有力量。
