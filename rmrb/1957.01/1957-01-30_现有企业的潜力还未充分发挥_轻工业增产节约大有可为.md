Xinhua News Agency, January 29th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Zhiqing reports: Exploiting the production potential of existing light industry enterprises to produce more and better products is the goal of light industry departments in carrying out the campaign for increased production and economy. According to the Ministry of Light Industry, if only nine industries such as rubber shoes, glass, and daily-use ceramics can fully utilize their production potential, output can be increased by half based on the current production level.

The relevant departments of the Ministry of Light Industry believe that most light industry sectors have sufficient raw materials and the technical conditions are also available, but the potential has not been fully exploited. Although some industries such as papermaking and leather have objective difficulties in raw material supply, and the current production potential cannot be fully exploited, these industries still have great potential in terms of raw material utilization and unit consumption quotas. If production technology is further improved on the existing basis, substitutes are found, and waste in production is reduced in many ways, output can still be increased.

The potential of light industrial enterprises is prominently reflected in the utilization of production equipment. According to the Ministry of Light Industry, the rubber shoe industry's First Five-Year Plan stipulated the production of 108 million pairs in 1957, but the utilization rate of production capacity only reached 60%. For the same specification of rubber mixing machine, some can reach a maximum of 18.5 revolutions per minute, while others only reach 12 revolutions. The potential in the leather industry is also very large. According to the 1957 plan, only about 60% of the national leather production capacity is utilized. For example, the Shanghai Leather Factory currently processes 100 kilograms of leather per cubic meter of drum; however, if the liquid ratio is increased to 1:1 and the filling coefficient is increased to 30%, production capacity will increase by 90%. If the glass industry can leverage its equipment potential, glass bottles alone are expected to increase production by 60% in 1957 compared to 1956.

Low quality of finished and semi-finished products and high reject rates are a serious problem for light industrial enterprises. If rejects can be reduced, output can be increased. For example, in the glass industry, the average furnace-front reject rate for instruments is 54%, and the furnace-back reject rate is 15%. The breakage rate of semi-finished products in the ceramics industry averages 20% to 30%. The paper recycling rate is also very high. If the paper that does not meet large specifications is cut into small specifications under the principle of ensuring the qualification rate of the paper, it is preliminarily estimated that more than 15,000 tons of paper can be produced annually.

There is also great potential in the unit consumption quota and utilization of raw materials. For example, in 1956, the unit consumption of pulp in state-owned factories for producing one ton of newsprint was a maximum of 1,144 kilograms and a minimum of 1,026 kilograms. According to statistics, if the papermaking industry reduces the unit consumption of pulp and increases the finished product rate in 1957, state-owned factories can increase production by 12,500 tons of paper throughout the year. If the raw material harvesting rate and steaming pot efficiency are improved, state-owned factories can increase production of 7,000 tons of pulp throughout the year. Raw material consumption is also very high in the glass and pencil industries. For example, for silver nitrate used in the production of thermos bottle liners, factories in Lushun-Dalian need 0.864 kilograms per thousand, while factories in Shanghai generally only need 0.56 kilograms; if the consumption quota of Lushun-Dalian factories is reduced to the level of Shanghai factories, the cost can be reduced by about 1.4%. For the unit consumption of paint used for pencils, the average was more than 0.72 kilograms per thousand pencils in 1956, with a maximum of 1.07 kilograms and a minimum of 0.35 kilograms; if it can be reduced to an average of more than 0.66 kilograms, the country can save paint worth 270,000 yuan a year.

There is also great potential in technical operating procedures. In the daily-use ceramics industry, efficiency can be doubled by simply changing the shaping of delicate wares to slurry casting. After all delicate wares are changed to slurry casting, production capacity will increase by more than 10%. In the bicycle industry, promoting the Hua Gu Tong (decorated ancient-style tube) components, changing the production method from forging first and then turning to stamping production, can increase production efficiency by one to two times. In the papermaking industry, promoting the experience of transfer slurry and late-stage water injection can shorten the cooking time by 20 minutes.

There is also potential to be tapped in labor organization. In industries such as clocks and watches and bicycles, due to unreasonable labor organization, technical workers are doing non-technical work, and some technical workers are doing auxiliary work, resulting in a machine operation rate of only 40% to 50%. Taking the Far East Clock Factory as an example, the actual working hours required to produce a clock are currently 157 minutes. If the labor organization is reasonably adjusted, the effective working time of technical workers is increased, and downtime is reduced, then a clock can be produced in 95 minutes.

### 现有企业的潜力还未充分发挥  轻工业增产节约大有可为

    现有企业的潜力还未充分发挥
    轻工业增产节约大有可为
    新华社29日讯　新华社记者张志清报道：发挥现有轻工业企业的生产潜力，生产更多更好的产品，是轻工业部门开展增产节约活动的努力目标。据轻工业部计算，目前仅胶鞋、玻璃、日用陶瓷等九个行业如果能够充分发挥生产潜力，按现有生产水平计算，还能增加产量一半。
    轻工业部有关方面认为：轻工业多数行业原料是足够的，技术条件也具备，但是潜力没有充分发挥出来。造纸、皮革等部分行业虽然存在着原料供应不足的客观困难，目前生产潜力还不能充分发挥，但是这些行业在原材料利用和单位消耗定额等方面都还有很大的潜力可挖，如果在现有的基础上进一步改进生产技术，寻找代用品，从多方面减少生产中的浪费，还是可以增加产量的。
    轻工业企业的潜力突出地表现在生产设备的利用上。据轻工业部计算，胶鞋行业第一个五年计划规定1957年生产一亿零八百万双，但是生产能力的利用率只达到60％，同一规格的炼胶机，一分钟有的最高达到十八点五转，有的只达到十二转。在制革行业中潜力也很大，按照1957年的计划，全国制革的生产能力仅利用60％左右。如上海制革厂目前每立方公尺转鼓处理皮子为一百公斤；但是，如果把液体系数提高为一比一，充满系数提高到30％，生产能力就会提高90％。玻璃行业如果能发挥设备潜力，仅玻璃瓶一项，1957年较1956年就预计能增产60％。
    成品半成品质量低，废品多，是目前轻工业企业的一个严重问题。如果能够减少废品，就可以增加产量。如玻璃行业中，仪器的炉前废品率平均是54％，炉后废品率是15％。陶瓷行业半成品的破损率平均是20％到30％。造纸的回抄率也很高，如果在保证纸的合格率的原则下，将不合大规格的纸裁成小规格纸，据初步计算，一年能增产一万五千多吨纸。
    在原材料的单位消耗定额和利用方面，潜力也很大。如纸浆单位消耗量，国营厂1956年每生产一吨新闻纸最高为一千一百四十四公斤，最低一千零二十六公斤。据统计，如果1957年造纸行业降低纸浆单位消耗量，提高成品率，全年国营厂能增产一万二千五百吨纸。如果提高原料收获率与蒸锅效率，全年国营厂能增产纸浆七千吨。玻璃行业和铅笔行业原料消耗量也很高。如作保温瓶瓶胆用的硝酸银，旅大的工厂每千个需用零点八六四公斤，上海各厂一般只用零点五六公斤；如果将旅大厂的消耗定额降低到上海各厂的水平，就可以降低成本1.4％左右。作铅笔用的油漆单位消耗量，1956年每千支笔平均为零点七二公斤多，最高达到一点零七公斤，最低是零点三五公斤；如果能降低到平均零点六六公斤多，全国一年就可以节约价值二十七万元的油漆。
    在技术操作规程方面也蕴藏着很大的潜力。日用陶瓷行业中，仅琢器改用注浆成型一项，效率可以提高一倍。琢器全部改用注浆以后，将提高生产能力10％以上。自行车行业推广花古筒部件，由先锻后车的生产方法改为冲压生产，可以提高生产效率一倍到两倍。造纸行业推广转注浆经验和后期注水经验以后，能使煮浆时间缩短二十分钟。
    在劳动组织方面，也有潜力好挖。如钟表、自行车等行业中，由于劳动组织不合理，技术工人做非技术工作，有的技术工人作辅助工作，以致机器运转率只达到40％到50％。以远东钟表厂为例，目前生产一只钟表实际耗用工时为一百五十七分钟，如果合理调整劳动组织，增加技术工人的有效工作时间，减少停台，那末用九十五分钟就能生产一只钟表。
