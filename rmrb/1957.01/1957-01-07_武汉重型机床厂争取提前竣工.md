Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 6th. The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, currently under construction, will enter its construction peak this year. This first universal heavy machine tool manufacturing plant in our country exceeded the state construction plan by 7% in 1956. This year, it will continue to accelerate the construction progress to meet the country's urgent need for heavy machine tools.
    The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant began leveling the ground in September 1955, and construction fully started in the second quarter of last year. So far, of the fifty-eight construction projects belonging to this factory, thirty-five have been started, of which nineteen have been completed. What was once a rolling hillside a year ago is now a magnificent group of buildings.
    According to the plan approved by the state, the construction task of the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant this year will be much heavier than last year. Among the three main factory buildings, two will be basically completed in terms of construction and installation in the third and fourth quarters, and will begin to be partially put into production. The other main factory building will also complete all construction work this year and begin installing machinery. The entire factory is expected to be fully completed by the end of the second quarter of next year, and will be fully put into production in the third quarter. In this way, the time for the completion and start of production of this factory will be one and a half years ahead of the original state plan.

    武汉重型机床厂争取提前竣工
    据新华社武汉6日电　正在建设中的武汉重型机床厂，今年将进入施工的最高潮。这座我国第一个万能性的重型机床制造厂，1956年曾经超额7％完成了国家建设计划，今年将继续加快建设进度，以适应国家对于重型机床的迫切需要。
    武汉重型机床厂是在1955年9月份开始平土，去年第二季度才全面开工进行建设的。截至目前为止，属于这座工厂的五十八项建设工程中，先后开工的已经有三十五项，其中有十九项已经完工。一年前还是丘陵起伏的地方，现在已经矗立起宏伟壮丽的建筑物群。
    根据国家批准的计划，武汉重型机床厂今年建设的任务将比去年繁重得多。三大主厂房中，有两个要在三、四季度内先后基本上完成建筑、安装工程，并且开始局部地投入生产；另一个主厂房也将在今年内完成全部建筑工程，并且开始安装机器。整个工厂预计到明年第二季度末，就可以全部建成，第三季度就能够全面地投入生产。这样，这座工厂建成和开工生产的时间，就将比国家原订计划提前一年半。
