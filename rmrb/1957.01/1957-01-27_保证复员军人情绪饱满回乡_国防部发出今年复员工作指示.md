Xinhua News Agency, 26th—The Ministry of National Defense has issued instructions on the 1957 demobilization work, requiring troops to do a good job of demobilization education to ensure that demobilized soldiers return home with high morale.

    The instructions stated that all troops should earnestly carry out education for demobilized soldiers. The content of the education should focus on enhancing demobilized soldiers' understanding of agricultural cooperativization and socialist construction, enabling them to possess the spirit of overcoming difficulties, saving money, and being thrifty in managing their households, and to be able to abide by national laws, respect the leadership of Party and government organs, and unite with the masses after returning to their hometowns. Before the demobilized soldiers leave, assessments should be made for each of them as much as possible, accurately pointing out their achievements and shortcomings. For veterans who have performed well, military ranks may be promoted as appropriate to encourage and promote the enthusiasm of demobilized soldiers, so that they can return to production posts with high morale.

    The instructions also require the leading organs of all troops and the military service organs to earnestly assist the government in doing a good job of resettling demobilized soldiers, and to regard this work as a long-term and important task.

    指示中说，各部队应该认真做好对复员军人的教育工作。教育内容应该着重提高复员军人对农业合作化和社会主义建设的认识，使他们具有克服困难、省吃俭用、勤俭持家的精神，并且在回乡以后，能够遵守国家法令、尊重党政机关领导和团结群众。复员军人临走之前，尽可能给他们每一个人作出鉴定，正确地指出他们的成绩和缺点。对于工作较好的老兵，可以酌情晋升军衔，以鼓励和发扬复员军人的积极性，使他们带着饱满的情绪回到生产岗位上去。
    指示中还要求各部队的领导机关以及各兵役机关，认真帮助政府做好复员军人的安置工作，把这一工作作为一项长期的重要任务。
