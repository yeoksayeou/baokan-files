Is it rewarding labor models? Or buying for others?
    Guess why the district committee secretary bought a hoe

    Wang Zhongsan, Deputy Secretary of the Anju District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Santai County, Sichuan Province, went to the local supply and marketing cooperative to buy a hoe on the very day he arrived at the Lizhong Agricultural Cooperative in Guanchiao Township of the district. This incident aroused discussion among many local farmers: some said he bought it to reward labor models, and some said he bought it to help others. But no one guessed correctly.

    It turned out that the Santai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently held an enlarged cadre meeting, calling on party members and cadres to go deep into the countryside to share weal and woe with the masses. Wang Zhongsan recalled that although he had made some achievements in rural work in the past two years, he spent most of his time in the village and community working in the office and talking, and rarely participated in production himself; he interacted more with cadres and less with the masses, and his work was not in-depth. Therefore, when he came to the Lizhong Agricultural Cooperative with the work team this time, he first quietly changed into old cotton clothes, and then bought hoes for himself and the other three cadres of the work team, and went to the fields to work with the members of the agricultural cooperative.

    When the members of the agricultural cooperative learned of their intentions, they were happy and grateful, and they all scrambled to clean up the new hoes for them. That afternoon, the cadres of the work team tightened their cotton clothes, swung their hoes, and worked with the members to accumulate cinder fertilizer and shovel turf fertilizer. Everyone worked very hard.

    Examples like Wang Zhongsan are not isolated in this district. In early January, District Committee Secretary Tan Shouyi and some township branch secretaries also bought hoes after going to the agricultural cooperatives. Many cadres who used to live in the district and township have now moved to live in farmers' homes.

    Due to the in-depth leadership style of the cadres, winter production in various townships in Anju District has quickly become a lively scene. More than 400 agricultural cooperatives in the district launched challenge-response competitions for winter production. In addition to doing a good job in the field management of spring crops, they also carried out land processing, mulberry planting, etc. A few agricultural cooperative cadres who originally did not like to work have now begun to change and participate in specific production activities.

### 是奖励劳动模范呢？还是给别人代买呢？猜猜区委书记为什么买锄头

    是奖励劳动模范呢？还是给别人代买呢？
    猜猜区委书记为什么买锄头
    中共四川省三台县安居区委员会副书记王中三，不久前来到这个区观桥乡利众农业社工作的当天，就跑到当地供销合作社去买了锄头。这件事引起当地许多农民的谈论：有的说他是买来奖励劳动模范的，有的说他是帮助别人代买的。但是大家都没有猜对。
    原来，中共三台县委会在最近召开了扩大干部会议，号召党员、干部深入农村与群众同甘共苦。王中三回想起这两年来在农村工作中虽然作出了一些成绩，但自己下村、下社，多是坐在办公室里动嘴，很少亲自动手生产；与干部打交道多，与群众接触较少，工作不深入。因此，当他这次带着工作组来到利众农业社时，他首先不声不响地换上旧棉衣，又给自己和工作组的另外三个干部买来了锄头，走向田野去找农业社社员一起干活路。
    当农业社社员们得知他们的心意后，又高兴、又感激，都争着来替他们收拾好新锄头。当天下午，工作组的干部紧扎棉衣，抡着锄头，和社员们一起积渣滓肥、铲草皮肥，大家干得很起劲。
    像王中三一类的事例，在这个区里并不是个别的。1月上旬，区委书记谭受益和有的乡支部书记，在下到农业社后也都买了锄头。许多过去一直在区、乡住的干部，这次也都下去住到农民家里。
    由于干部们的领导作风深入，安居区各乡的冬季生产很快就搞得热火朝天。全区四百多个农业社展开了冬季生产竞赛的挑战应战。他们除了作好小春作物田间管理，还进行土地加工、栽桑等。原来不爱劳动的少数农业社干部，现在也开始转变，参加了具体生产活动。
