    "Although the Steelyard Weight is Small, it Can Weigh a Thousand Jin"
    Lè Fū
    Amidst the clamor for tight material supply, some industrial and commercial departments in charge only emphasize "guaranteeing key supplies," but neglect the special needs of small enterprises.
    When you stretch out ten fingers, some are long and some are short, factories are also big and small. Some enterprises, although small in scale and with backward equipment, play a very important role in national construction. The Wuxi Huazhong Shuttle Factory, a joint state-private enterprise, is such a small factory. This factory has a total of fifty-eight employees, and the conditions of the factory are very poor in all aspects; however, its product—shuttles—are indispensable production tools for weaving factories. More than 70% of the shuttles used by textile factories in Jiangsu Province are supplied by this factory. Obviously, the production of this factory is directly related to the production of many textile factories, and also directly related to the completion of the textile industrial production plan of Jiangsu Province.
    However, this year, the main raw material used by this factory to manufacture shuttles—more than 700 cubic meters of Cyclobalanopsis glauca timber—is facing a break in supply because the factory is too small and does not meet the conditions of an "applicant unit." Although the Huazhong Shuttle Factory has sent people to Jiangxi, Fujian, Anhui, Beijing, Nanjing and other places since August last year, running almost all relevant leading organs of the central and provincial governments, spending more than 1,000 yuan in round-trip travel expenses, and spending more than four months, in addition to sending nearly a hundred telegrams and official documents to appeal to various places, exhausting all kinds of methods, it has still not been resolved. Now, one agency is pushing it to another agency; the second agency is pushing it to the third agency, and some agencies simply ignore it. The reason is very simple, that is, they think this is a small factory with dozens of people, and it "doesn't matter" if it is not resolved temporarily, and they do not see that the production of this factory is directly related to the production of large factories. Now, this factory is facing the threat of shutdown, and it can be foreseen that the follow-up will be that the shuttle supply will not be able to keep up, affecting the production of weaving factories. From this example, we can see that the leading organs must not measure the importance of factories and enterprises by size. As the saying goes, "Though the pepper is small, it bites the tongue; though the steelyard weight is small, it can weigh a thousand jin." In some cases, things may be small, but they have their special role. Moreover, some problems may seem to be small problems at first glance, but if they are not resolved in time, they may develop into big problems. It is hoped that the relevant leading organs will consider more practical needs and not simply decide problems based only on small and large.

    “秤锤虽小坠千斤”
    乐夫
    在材料供应紧张声中，某些工商业的主管部门，只强调“保证重点供应”，却忽视了小企业的特殊需要。
    十个手指头伸出来，有长有短，工厂有大有小。有的企业虽然规模小，设备落后，对国家建设却起着很重要的作用。公私合营无锡华钟梭子厂，就是这样一个小厂。这个厂共有五十八个职工，工厂各方面条件都很差；可是它的产品——梭子却是织布厂必不可少的生产工具。江苏省纺织厂用的梭子，有70％以上都是靠这个厂供应的。显然，这个厂的生产，直接关系着许多个纺织厂的生产，也直接关系着江苏省纺织工业生产计划的完成。
    但是，这个厂今年制造梭子用的主要原材料——七百多立方公尺青岗木材，却因工厂小不够“申请单位”的条件，以致原料断了供应来源。尽管华钟梭子厂从去年8月份起，就派人到江西、福建、安徽、北京、南京等地，几乎跑遍了所有中央和省的有关领导机关，往返路费花了一千多元，费时四个多月，另外还发了将近百件电报、公文向各处呼吁，想尽了各种办法，还是没有解决。现在是甲机关推给乙机关；乙机关又推给丙机关，有的机关则根本置之不理。原因很简单，就是认为这是个几十人的小厂，暂时不解决也“没啥”，而没有看到这个厂的生产是直接关系着大厂生产的。现在，这个厂已经面临停工的威胁，可以预见，跟着来的将是梭子供应不上，影响织布厂的生产。从这个事例可以看到，领导机关绝不能以大小来衡量工厂企业的重要与否。俗话说，“胡椒虽小辣人心，秤锤虽小坠千斤”。在某些情况下，事物虽小，却有着它的特殊作用。何况有些问题初看起来是个小问题，如不及时解决就可能发展成为大问题。希望有关领导机关，多考虑些实际需要，不要简单地只根据小和大来决定问题。
