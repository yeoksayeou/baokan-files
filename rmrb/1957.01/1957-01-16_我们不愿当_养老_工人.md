    We Don't Want to Be "Retirement" Workers
    In the Jiafeng Textile Factory, a joint state-private enterprise in Jiading County, Jiangsu Province, there is a power generation room with a 500-kilowatt turbine generator, responsible for supplying part of the factory's electricity. Twenty-one of us work here. In July 1955, in order to unify power dispatch and save coal, the Shanghai Electric Power Administration decided to stop using this generator. All the staff in the power generation room remained in their original positions, and salaries were paid as usual.
    From July 1955 to now, it has been a year and a half. This generator is still in the factory, and we twenty-one workers (including technicians and skilled workers) still receive our salaries every month (salaries are generally 60 or 70 yuan, with some as high as 80 to over 100 yuan), but there is still no work. Now, every day we: go to work and wait for mealtime, finish eating and wait to get off work, wait for payday to receive our salaries, and also wait to grow old. We feel very sad when we see that comrades in other types of work in the factory are working hard and dedicating their strength to socialist construction. We are not retirement workers, we want to create wealth for our country. The machine should be used, we need work!
        Cao Xueliang and five others from Jiafeng Textile Factory

    我们不愿当“养老”工人
    江苏省嘉定县公私合营嘉丰纺织厂有一个发电间，这里有一台五百瓩涡轮发电机，负责厂里一部分电力的供应。我们二十一个工人就在这里工作。1955年7月，上海电业管理局为了统一调度用电，节省燃煤，决定停止使用这台发电机，发电间的全体工作人员仍留原工作岗位，薪金照发。
    从1955年7月到现在，已经一年半了，这台发电机还停在厂里，我们二十一个工人（包括技术人员、技术工人）也月月照领薪金（薪金一般都是六、七十元，高的八十元到一百元以上），工作却仍然没有。现在我们天天是：上班后等吃饭，吃好饭等下班，到号头等拿薪金，还有一个等衰老。我们看着厂里其他工种的同志都是使劲干活，把力量献给社会主义建设，心里非常难过。我们不是养老工人，我们要为祖国创造财富。机器应该使用，我们需要工作！
