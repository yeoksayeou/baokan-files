Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou Telegram. Various types of folding furniture recently displayed at the Zhejiang Provincial Handicraft Industry Bureau's wood furniture exhibition have been well-received by many visitors. The Wenzhou Woodware Production Cooperative manufactured what looks like a standing cabinet, but when disassembled, it becomes a bed, a desk, a chest of drawers, and an exquisite standing cabinet. This four-in-one furniture not only takes up little space but is also easy to move. They also designed a foldable bookcase, which is seven feet two inches high and one foot eight inches wide, but only five and a half inches wide when folded, making it easy to carry. Woodware producers in Yuyao County also designed a set of compact and portable office desks and chairs. All four legs of the office desk are movable and can be folded. The desk is also very light, and one person can carry it. Woodworkers in Xiaoshan County manufactured a writing desk where locking one drawer prevents all other drawers from being opened, saving a lot of hardware materials. The three-in-one stroller for babies, designed by the Hangzhou No. 5 Woodware Production Cooperative, which can be used for sitting, lying down, and pushing, has also been welcomed by mothers.

There were more than 20 types of furniture exhibited at the exhibition. After observing and studying them, handicraft workers from various places felt that there were many advantages and decided to promote production throughout the province next year.

    折叠式的家具
    新华社杭州电　浙江省手工业管理局最近在木器家具展览会上展出的各式各样折叠式的家具，受到了不少参观者的好评。温州市木器生产合作社制造了一个看起来像个站柜，但拆开来却是一张床、一张书桌、一个五斗橱和一个精致的站柜，这个四用的家具不但占面积小，而且搬动也很方便。他们还设计了一个可以折叠的书橱，这个高七尺二寸，宽一尺八寸的书橱，折叠后只有五寸半宽，可以随身携带。余姚县的木器生产者还设计了一套小巧玲珑、携带方便的办公桌椅，办公桌的四只脚全部是活动的，可以折叠起来，桌子的重量也很轻，一个人可以提着走。萧山县木器工人制造的写字台，只要一个抽屉上了锁，其他的抽屉都拉不开，这种办公桌可以节省不少五金器材。杭州市第五木器生产社设计的可以坐、卧、推三用的幼儿车，也受到了母亲们的欢迎。
    展览会上展出的家具共有二十多种，各地手工业者观摩和研究后，都认为好处很多，已决定明年在全省推广生产。
