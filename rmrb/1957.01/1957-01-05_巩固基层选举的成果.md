    Currently, most counties and cities across the country have completed grassroots elections, and the remaining few counties and cities are also entering the final stages of grassroots elections. In the elections, many places have not only fully promoted democracy, but also earnestly consolidated the achievements of the elections, making the democratic system of grassroots state organs more substantial and complete, and further enlivening the people's democratic life.
    However, in many areas, as the election work neared its end, there was a phenomenon of relaxed leadership and hasty completion. When convening people's congresses, they did not widely collect opinions and demands from the masses, and also left behind the opinions and demands raised by the masses during the election process. Some places simply did not rectify the organization and system of grassroots regimes, or only formally announced the meeting system of the people's congresses and people's committees and the establishment of those organizations according to the provisions of national laws and instructions from higher authorities, while rarely asking how to give play to their role, so that the chaotic phenomenon of township government organizations and work remained the same. In other places, it was thought that the task was completed once the representatives were elected, and the issues of what work the representatives do and how to contact the voters were not seriously resolved.
    Consolidating the achievements of the election is an important task that cannot be ignored throughout the entire election process. Even in those places where the election work has been done well, if attention is not paid to consolidating the achievements of the election, it will be "all in vain"; while in those places where the election work has shortcomings, if the achievements of the election can be earnestly consolidated, some of the shortcomings in the work can be compensated. The key to consolidating the achievements of the election lies in further strengthening leadership, especially the county and city-level government organs should specifically guide grassroots units to do the following two aspects of work when ending the election work: On the one hand, the opinions and demands raised by the masses in the entire election process should be carefully studied and handled according to their importance and urgency, and those that need the help of the leadership should be strongly supported and resolved; on the other hand, the various organizations and systems of the grassroots people's congresses and people's committees should be enriched and improved, and their role should be fully played, so that cadres can gradually become accustomed to relying on and using these organizations to carry out their work in practice.
    In this grassroots election work, due to the improvement of the masses' political consciousness, many valuable opinions have been put forward on the work of the government and the style of cadres. According to the statistics of eighty-seven grassroots units in twelve provinces, the masses put forward more than 16,000 constructive and critical opinions. These opinions not only reflect the specific requirements of the people in production and life, but also examine the work of the Party and the government. Concentrating these opinions well and earnestly solving them can not only effectively overcome the current shortcomings in grassroots work, but also enable leaders at all levels to be closer to the masses and closer to reality, and avoid or reduce mistakes in their work. Zaoyuan Township, Yan'an County, Shaanxi Province, fully promoted democracy in this election. The people of the whole township, with the attitude of masters, conducted a democratic inspection of the government's work and the style of cadres. The masses put forward a total of 434 opinions and demands. After the urgent problems such as the masses' request for the government to help repair the Zaoyuan canal and supply grain to grain-deficient households according to regulations were resolved, they felt very satisfied. They reflected: "This election has solved our big problems." Among the more than 400 opinions put forward by the masses, more than 100 were related to the style of cadres. These opinions sharply criticized and exposed the bureaucratic and commanding style of some cadres in their work who did not conduct investigations and research, did not act according to policies, and did not care about the lives of the masses. The township head, branch secretary, and township clerk took the initiative to make self-criticism to the masses and obtained the understanding of the masses. The people have more trust and support for the people's congresses and people's committees produced through their own elections, and the work of the township is carried out vigorously under the supervision of the masses, and the production enthusiasm of the masses is also unprecedentedly high. Zaoyuan Township has done this, consolidating the achievements of the election, and other grassroots units can certainly do the same.
    After the first general election in the country, people's congresses were established in various places, but in some places, grassroots units did not form a regular system; the various organizations and systems of the people's committees were also mostly reduced to formalities. Many people criticized in this election: "The representatives elected in the past did not play a role, so what is the use of electing representatives again this time?" Therefore, it is necessary to establish and improve the organizations and systems of the people's congresses and people's committees in a practical rather than formal way through this election. At the same time, it is necessary to organize grassroots cadres to study relevant laws and decrees, and strengthen the concept of the legal system, so that they can both understand that "democracy is the source of strength" and understand the seriousness of strictly implementing the people's congress system in accordance with legal provisions. In order to strengthen the people's supervision of the work of state organs and strengthen the ties between the government and the masses, it is also necessary to establish a system for representatives to contact voters and for the government to contact representatives. Each grassroots unit should establish representative groups according to production units and voter residential areas in accordance with the provisions of the law, and representatives should also divide their work to contact voters on a fixed basis. The methods of individual visits by representatives, regular voter meetings, and the establishment of voter reception rooms and voter message books that have been implemented in many places can also be tried out in areas with conditions according to specific circumstances. In addition to holding representative symposiums and designating special personnel to receive representative visits, some cities currently organize representatives to go deep into understanding the situation on a regular basis, which is a very good method, and other cities with conditions can also promote it.
    Seriously handling the opinions of the masses and improving the various organizations and systems of grassroots regimes are two inseparable aspects of consolidating the achievements of the election. Only by seriously handling the opinions of the masses and meeting the democratic requirements of the masses can we further stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in national management and national construction, and enable grassroots regimes to continuously improve their work under the supervision of the masses; at the same time, enriching and improving the various organizations and systems of grassroots regimes can constantly enliven the country's democratic life and enable the enthusiasm of the masses to be constantly developed.

    巩固基层选举的成果
    权剑琴
    目前全国大部分县、市已经完成了基层选举，其余少数县、市的基层选举也进入结束阶段。在选举中，很多地方不仅充分发扬了民主，而且认真地巩固了选举的成果，使基层国家机关的民主制度更加充实和完备，进一步活跃了人民民主生活。
    但是，也有不少地区在选举工作临近结束的时候，出现了放松领导、草率收兵的现象。在召开人民代表大会的时候，没有广泛地搜集群众的意见和要求，而且把群众在选举过程中提出的意见和要求也丢在脑后了。有些地方根本没有整顿基层政权的组织、制度，或者只是形式地根据国家法律的规定和上级的指示，宣布一下人民代表大会和人民委员会的会议制度和建立那些组织，而很少过问如何发挥它们的作用，以致乡政权组织和工作的混乱现象依然如故。还有的地方，认为代表选出来就完成了任务，至于代表作什么工作、如何联系选民等问题，则没有认真地加以解决。
    巩固选举成果是整个选举过程中不容忽视的一项重要工作。即是在那些选举工作做得好的地方，如果不注意巩固选举的成果，也会“前功尽弃”；而在那些选举工作做得有缺点的地方，如果能认真巩固选举的成果，也会弥补工作中的一些缺陷。巩固选举成果的关键在于进一步加强领导，特别是县、市一级政权机关要具体指导基层单位在结束选举工作的时候，做好以下两方面的工作：一方面是，把群众在整个选举过程中提出的意见和要求，分别轻重缓急，认真地加以研究处理，需要领导上帮助的，应该大力支持予以解决；另一方面是，把基层人民代表大会和人民委员会的各种组织、制度充实和健全起来，充分发挥它的作用，使干部在实践中能够逐步地习惯依靠和运用这些组织进行工作。
    这次基层选举工作中，由于群众政治觉悟的提高，对政府工作和干部作风提出了许多宝贵的意见，据十二个省八十七个基层单位的统计，群众提出的建设性的和批评的意见共有一万六千多条。这些意见不只是反映了人民群众生产和生活上的一些具体要求，而且也检查了党和政府的工作。把这些意见很好地集中起来，认真地研究解决，既能够有效地克服当前基层工作中的缺点，也能够使各级领导更接近群众、接近实际，在工作中不犯或少犯一些错误。陕西省延安县枣园乡，在这次选举中充分发扬了民主，全乡人民以主人翁态度，对政府工作和干部作风进行了一次民主大检查，群众共提出了四百三十四条意见和要求。群众要求政府帮助修补枣园水渠和按照规定供应缺粮户粮食等迫切问题得到解决以后，感到非常满意，他们反映：“这次选举把咱们的大问题解决了。”群众提出的四百多条意见中，有关干部作风方面的就有一百多条。这些意见尖锐地批评和揭发了一些干部在工作中不调查研究，不按政策办事、不关心群众生活的官僚主义和强迫命令作风。乡长、支部书记和乡文书主动地向群众作了检讨，取得了群众的谅解。人民对于经过自己选举到产生的人民代表大会和人民委员会更加信任和支持，乡的工作在群众的监督下生气蓬勃地开展起来，群众的生产热情也空前高涨。枣园乡这样做了，巩固了选举成果，其他的基层单位当然也是可以这样做的。
    全国第一次普选以后，各地都建立了人民代表大会，但是有的地方的基层单位没有形成经常的制度；人民委员会的各种组织、制度也大多流于形式。很多群众在这次选举中提出批评说：“过去选的代表不起作用，这次又选代表干什么？”因此必须通过这次选举把人民代表大会和人民委员会的组织、制度切实地而不是形式地建立和健全起来。同时要组织基层干部学习有关的法律、法令，加强法制观念，以便使他们既能够体会到“民主是力量的源泉”，又懂得严格按照法律规定执行人民代表大会制度的严肃性。为了加强人民对于国家机关工作的监督，密切政府同群众的联系，还需要建立代表联系选民和政府联系代表的制度。每个基层单位都应该依照法律的规定，按照生产单位和选民居住地区建立代表小组，代表并且应该分工固定地联系选民。许多地方已经实行的代表个别访问、定期召开选民会，以及设立选民接待室、选民留言簿等办法，在有条件的地区也可以根据具体情况试行。政府联系代表，除了举行代表座谈会和指定专人接待代表来访外，目前有些城市组织代表定期深入了解情况是一个很好的办法，其他有条件的城市也可以推广。
    认真处理群众的意见和健全基层政权的各种组织、制度是巩固选举成果不可分割的两个方面。只有认真地处理了群众的意见，满足了群众的民主要求，才能更加激发群众参加国家管理和国家建设的积极性，并使基层政权在群众的监督下不断地改进自己的工作；同时，充实和健全了基层政权的各种组织、制度，就能够经常地活跃国家的民主生活，使群众的积极性得到经常不断的发扬。
