Dulles' Annotation of the "Eisenhower Doctrine"
    Hu Ping

American diplomats often use two languages: one is made up of perplexing diplomatic terms and groundless lies, which is used in official documents and public speeches; the other is plain and understandable common language, but it is only allowed to be used in closed-door "secret meetings" or similar occasions.

Dulles was responsible for drafting the Middle East policy message that Eisenhower presented to Congress at the beginning of this year. In order to conceal America's aggressive intentions with the first language, it is said that he changed twelve drafts in five days. However, it seems that the results are still not very good. Senator Fulbright commented on this message: "Poorly designed" and "quite hollow."

In order to deal with this kind of criticism from the congressmen, Dulles has recently been "testifying" in various committees of the Senate and House of Representatives for several days, and urging them to quickly pass the Eisenhower plan. According to a count by a United Press reporter, in two days, Dulles stood on the speaker's platform in Congress for a total of ten hours and thirty-five minutes.

Dulles' speeches are confidential, but American reporters occasionally reveal some of them. In these revealed words, Dulles provided some clear and understandable annotations to the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

What exactly does the United States want to "protect"?

Eisenhower's message stated that the United States proposed the Middle East plan in order to "protect" the "independence" of the countries in the region.

However, in front of the American congressmen, Dulles gave a completely different explanation. He said: The United States proposed the "Eisenhower Doctrine" because the United States "relies on the natural resources and trade routes of the Middle East" and "obtains a large amount of materials for manufacturing atomic weapons from Africa"; now, if the United States does not take action quickly, then "we firmly believe that this region is very likely to be lost," and "the entire Africa is also very likely to be lost along with it—bases or raw materials will be lost."

Look! It turns out that what the United States intends to "protect" is not the "independence" of the Middle Eastern countries, but the "bases and raw materials" on the territory of the Middle Eastern countries that the United States wants to plunder. According to Dulles and his ilk, the Middle East "region" does not seem to belong to the people of the Middle East but to the United States, therefore, he is afraid of losing his own money bag, and worries that "this region is very likely to be lost"!

What is the "danger of Communist aggression"?

Then, who exactly is the United States afraid of the Middle East region being "lost" to?

In public, Dulles and Eisenhower both shouted about the so-called "danger" of "Communist aggression" in the Middle East. However, in the secret meeting room of the United States Congress, there is naturally no need to play this daytime ghost trick anymore. Dulles frankly told the American congressmen that he "does not know of any new evidence" sufficient to prove that the Soviet Union "plans to directly invade the Middle East"; he also "does not know of any evidence proving that the Soviet Union is going to attack the United States."

Dulles secretly pointed out to the congressmen that the "danger" does not come from Communist "aggression," but from the nationalist sentiments of the people of the Middle Eastern countries. At a joint meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Military Committee, he anxiously reported that now, "the sentiment in that region is rising," there are "so many currents and crosscurrents," and it is a "very difficult and complex situation." In order to explain this "dangerous" situation, he issued a statement to the aforementioned joint meeting, saying: "This is not a new situation. However, it has new significance today. The deterrent effect that certain Western European countries may have has changed. Until recently, they provided a major deterrent to prevent the Communists from carrying out aggression in the Middle East. However, for several reasons, this force can no longer meet current needs."

Eisenhower's and Dulles' dictionaries are so different from everyone else's. What they call "Communist aggression" translates to: the national independence movements of the people of the Middle Eastern countries who are resisting the so-called "deterrent force" of the colonial rulers. Isn't it very clear that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is a strengthening of American aggressive actions in the Middle East!

How to carry out "protection"?

Since the United States wants to use its own "deterrent force" to replace the bankrupt "deterrent force" of Britain and France to suppress the people of the Middle East, how does this plan begin to be implemented? Dulles explained the "three important aspects" of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to the Senate: First, use "military deterrent force" to intimidate Middle Eastern countries that demand independence; second, use "military aid" to establish regimes in certain Middle Eastern countries that are loyal to the United States; third, use "economic aid" to place Middle Eastern countries under American control.

Among these three, "the first is to help prevent subversive activities." Dulles also said some specific practices: "This will include establishing a domestic security or police force in the country. ... The United States can pay for some countries to meet the salaries of domestic security forces, so that morale can be enhanced, and the possibility of having a loyal security force can also be increased."

The "security force" that Dulles longs for, which is "loyal" to the Western colonial countries, has already established one in Israel. This force has already served Britain and France once. In Turkey and Iraq, this force, which was expanded with "American money," has also contributed to the United States. For example, not long ago, when the United States instigated a conspiracy to subvert the Syrian government, the Turkish and Iraqi troops were ordered to move to their borders with Syria. Last December, when the broad masses of the Iraqi people held strikes and demonstrations to oppose the Said government's policies that violated the interests of the Arab nation, the Iraqi "security forces" also came out, resulting in hundreds of Iraqis being killed, thousands injured, and eight thousand college and middle school students being arrested. Therefore, the United States now hopes to have more of these "loyal" troops in the Middle Eastern countries, so as to suppress the people's resistance at any time and maintain the interests of American colonialists.

Who does American "aid" "serve"?

Eisenhower's message stated that the so-called "aid" from the United States to the Middle East region is to "serve the welfare of the people of other countries."

What exactly is the way to "serve"? In addition to the above-mentioned method of establishing a "security force," American reporters did not report in detail the other methods that Dulles talked about in Congress, but only mentioned the words "income of oil-producing countries and oil-transporting countries" and "carrying out major water conservancy and irrigation development projects" in general terms. Judging from this, what the United States intends to continue doing is still the old trick of occupying the oil resources of the Middle Eastern countries and attempting to control the use of the Jordan River water. According to a United Press reporter, the scope of Dulles' discussion with the congressmen was quite broad, and some congressmen had "asked about his law firm's relationship with foreign governments" and about the past "resolution of the Iranian oil dispute by the U.S. State Department." Speaking of the Iranian oil incident, this is well known: the United States helped Britain overthrow the then Iranian government, undermined Iran's oil nationalization plan, and seized a large part of the control of Iranian oil for itself. Now, it is obviously not without reason that he and the American congressmen are reliving old dreams.

This kind of "service" plan is of course a great "benefit" to American monopoly capitalists, but it is hard to say for the Middle Eastern countries. This time, Dulles admitted in his testimony to Congress that some Middle Eastern countries that had accepted American "aid" in the past are now "in very bad situations." He counted them one by one: Turkey's financial situation is "very tense," Iraq "is facing a very serious economic situation," and the situation in Iran "is also like this." He warned Congress: "Currently, due to lack of income, some of these countries may immediately fall into anarchy," they "are already very close to bankruptcy," so that giving it "loans" will not help, but "only direct grants." He believes that: Whether the United States "loses or rescues (?)" this region "may depend on whether it can get these two hundred million dollars" (referring to the annual cost of two hundred million dollars proposed in the "Eisenhower Plan.")

Dulles' confession is quite valuable. Because, he not only confessed that the purpose of American "aid" is to rescue the crisis of American control forces and colonial interests in the Middle East region, but also quite vividly stated that the fiscal crisis encountered by the country that received the most American "aid" is the most serious example.

    “艾森豪威尔主义”的杜勒斯注解
    胡平
    美国的外交官们经常使用两种语言：一种语言是由令人费解的外交词令和不着边际的谎言构成的，它用之于官方文书和公开言论；另一种是明白易懂的通常的语言，但这只有在关起门来的“秘密会议”上或其他类似场合才准许使用。
    杜勒斯在今年年初负责起草了艾森豪威尔向国会提出的中东政策咨文。为了想用第一种语言把美国的侵略目的遮掩起来，据说他在五天中换了十二个草稿。但是，看来成绩还是不很好。参议员富布赖特就给这个咨文下了一个评语：“设计拙劣”、“相当空洞”。
    为了应付议员们的这种挑剔，杜勒斯最近接连几天都在参众两院的这样那样的委员会“作证”，并且督促他们赶快通过艾森豪威尔计划。据合众社记者的统计，在两天里，杜勒斯在国会的发言席上就总共站了十小时又三十五分钟。
    杜勒斯的这些发言是保密的，但美国记者们还是偶尔透露出来了一些。在这些透露出来的话里，杜勒斯给“艾森豪威尔主义”提供了某些明白易懂的注解。
    美国究竟想“保护”什么？
    艾森豪威尔咨文中说，美国提出中东计划，是为了“保护”这个地区国家的“独立”。
    但是，在美国议员们面前，杜勒斯却做了完全不同的解释。他说：美国提出“艾森豪威尔主义”，是因为美国“有赖于中东的天然资源和贸易通路”，并且“从非洲取得大量制造原子武器的物资”；现在，美国如果不迅速采取行动，那末“我们肯定地相信，这个地区是非常有可能丧失的”，而且，“整个非洲也极可能随之丧失——基地或原料都会丧失”。
    看！原来美国打算“保护”的并不是什么中东国家的“独立”，而是美国所要掠夺的中东国家领土上的“基地和原料”。据杜勒斯之流看来，中东“这个地区”，似乎不是属于中东人民的而是为美国所有的，因此，他像害怕失掉自己的钱袋一样，担心“这个地区非常有可能丧失”！
    什么叫“共产党侵略危险”？
    那末，美国究竟害怕中东地区“可能丧失”给谁呢？
    在公开场合，杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔都喊叫所谓“共产党侵略”中东的“危险”。可是，到了美国国会的秘密会议室里，自然用不着再耍这套白昼见鬼的把戏了。杜勒斯坦率地告诉美国议员们，他“不知道有什么新的证据”，足以证明苏联“计划对中东进行直接侵略”；也“不知道有任何证据，证明苏联将要进攻美国”。
    杜勒斯偷偷地向议员们指出，“危险”不是来自共产党“侵略”，而是来自中东各国人民的民族主义情绪。在参议院外交委员会和军事委员会的联席会议上，他十分焦急地报告说：现在，“那个地区的情绪正在高涨”，有“那么多的顺流和逆流”，这是个“非常困难和复杂的局势”。为了说明这种“危险”局势，他向上述的联席会议发表声明说：“这不是新的情况。但是，它在今天具有新的意义。某些西欧国家可能起的威慑作用有了改变。最近以前，它们为了使共产党不敢在中东进行侵略提供了重大的威慑力量。但是，由于若干原因，这种力量再也不能应付目前的需要了。”
    艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯的字典就是这么与众不同。他们嘴里所说的“共产党侵略”，翻译出来就是：中东各国人民反抗殖民统治者的所谓“威慑力量”的民族独立运动。“艾森豪威尔主义”是美国对中东地区的侵略行动的加强，这不是非常明白了吗！
    怎样进行“保护”？
    既然美国想要用它自己的“威慑力量”代替英法已经破了产的“威慑力量”来镇压中东人民，这个计划怎样着手实行呢？杜勒斯向参议院说明了“艾森豪威尔主义”的“三个重要方面”：一、用“军事威慑力量”向要求独立的中东国家实行恫吓；二、用“军事援助”来在中东某些国家建立忠实于美国的政权；三、用“经济援助”来把中东国家置于美国束缚之下。
    在这三者之中，“首先就是为了帮助防止颠覆活动”。杜勒斯并且说出了一些具体的做法：“这将包括在该国设立一支国内保安或警察部队。……美国出钱，可以使一些国家应付国内保安部队的薪饷，这么一来，就可以增强士气，也可以增加拥有一支忠心耿耿的保安部队的可能。”
    杜勒斯所想望的这种对西方殖民国家“忠心耿耿”的“保安部队”，在以色列早就建立了一支。这支部队已替英法效劳了一次。在土耳其和伊拉克，这种用“美国出钱”扩建起来的部队，也给美国出过力。例如，不久以前美国策动颠覆叙利亚政府的阴谋的时候，土耳其和伊拉克的军队就奉命调到了它们和叙利亚的边境。去年12月，伊拉克广大人民由于反对赛义德政府的违背阿拉伯民族利益的政策而举行罢工和示威的时候，伊拉克的“保安部队”也出动了，结果是几百名伊拉克人被打死，几千人受伤，八千名大中学生被逮捕。因此，美国现在希望在中东国家能有更多的这样“忠心耿耿”的部队，以便随时镇压人民的反抗，维持美国殖民者的利益。
    美“援”为谁“服务”？
    艾森豪威尔的咨文里说，美国对中东地区的所谓“援助”是要为“其他国家的人民的福利服务”。
    “服务”的办法究竟怎样呢？除了上述的建立“保安部队”一法之外，美国记者没有把杜勒斯在国会所谈到的其他方法详细报道出来，只是笼统地提了一下“产油国家和输油国家的收入”、“进行主要的水利和灌溉发展工程”这类字眼。由此看来，美国打算继续搞下去的，还是过去的霸占中东国家的石油资源和企图控制约旦河水的利用等等那些老一套的办法。据美联社记者透露，杜勒斯和议员们讨论的范围相当广泛，有的议员曾“问及他的律师事务所同外国政府的关系”，问及美国国务院过去“解决伊朗石油争端那回事”。谈到伊朗石油事件，这是大家所熟知的：美国帮着英国搞垮了当时的伊朗政府，破坏了伊朗的石油国有化计划，并且把伊朗石油的控制权的很大部分夺到了自己手里。现在，他和美国议员们重温旧梦显然不是无因的。
    这类“服务”计划，对美国的垄断资本家们当然是莫大的“福利”，可是，对于中东国家却很难说了。这次，杜勒斯在国会作证中就承认，过去接受美国“援助”的某些中东国家，现在“都是处境很坏的”。他一个一个地数出：土耳其的财政情况“十分紧张”，伊拉克“面临着一个非常严重的经济局面”，伊朗的情况“也是这样”。他向国会警告说：“目前，由于缺乏收入，这些国家中的某些国家可能立即会陷入无政府状态”，它们“已经非常近于破产”，以致给它“贷款”也缓不济急，而“只能直接赠款”。他认为：美国“究竟是失掉还是救出（？）这个地区，可能就取决于是否能得到这二亿美元”（指“艾森豪威尔计划”中提出的每年二亿美元费用。）
    杜勒斯这段自白是颇有价值的。因为，他不但供认了美国“援助”的目的是为了抢救美国在中东地区的控制势力和殖民利益的危机，而且还相当生动地道出了接受美“援”最多的国家所遭遇的财政危机就是最严重的实例。
