    An Interesting Discussion

    Since December 19, 1956, the *Neimenggu Ribao* (Inner Mongolia Daily) has opened a special column for democratic cooperative management discussion meetings. In the past half-month, many agricultural cooperative directors, production team leaders, agricultural cooperative members, and rural workers have expressed their opinions in this column.

        Who is Right?

    On December 19, the *Neimenggu Ribao* published an article by a reporter entitled "Who Should We Listen To?" This article reported on some phenomena of commandism that occurred in the Xinsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Donglaozhangying Township, Salachi County, over the past year. These manifestations of commandism included deducting work points, squeezing investment, and labeling members as "Category Three Members" (referring to backward members), and so on.

    This advanced cooperative has made great achievements in expanding cultivated land, improving soil, increasing fertilizer application, and rationally irrigating over the past year, which has ensured the development of production. Therefore, the members are basically satisfied with the cooperative. However, they are very dissatisfied with the cadres' commandist style. Some members said: Our people, land, livestock, and farm tools have all entered the cooperative. Who doesn't want to run the cooperative well! But in the first year of joining the cooperative, we didn't understand many rules, and some things we couldn't figure out for a while. It would be easy to handle if the cadres explained the reasons clearly. However, the cadres don't trust us and insist on dividing the members into categories one, two, and three. People like to be treated kindly. Isn't the distance between the members and the cooperative cadres getting farther and farther away when the cadres treat us this way!

    However, the cadres also have their own difficulties and their own views. A deputy director of the Xinsheng Cooperative said: We work hard all year round, isn't it all for everyone! As a result, we are scolded by the members. How can a cadre be a cadre! The director of the supervisory committee of this cooperative said: We have no grudges against anyone. Deducting work points is just to scare people. Treating the masses is like treating children. You have to coax and scare them at the same time, otherwise they will make even more trouble! Democratic cooperative management is a good thing, but I'm afraid of "democracy not running the cooperative." Everyone only cares about getting something for their own family! Another deputy director of the cooperative said: Commandism is not right. Good cooperative members don't need commandism. It is impossible to do without commandism to deal with those troublesome members! If we hadn't squeezed investment in the spring, we wouldn't have been able to plant the land, and we would have nothing to eat in the autumn!

    The members have one view, and the cooperative cadres have another view. Who is right? The editor of the *Neimenggu Ribao* asked everyone to discuss it.

      Main Points of the Debate

    Judging from the discussion situation in the past half-month, rural grassroots cadres indeed have different views on the issue of democratic cooperative management. Some grassroots cadres actually do not approve of or do not fully approve of the principle of democratic cooperative management. They expressed more or less sympathy for the cadres of the Xinsheng Agricultural Cooperative. Two cadres from the Democratic First Agricultural Cooperative and the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Urad Front Banner cited the backward performances of some backward members in the cooperative who only rushed to do work with high work points, refused to do work with low work points, were lazy, and ruined public property. They advocated that democracy should not be implemented for those who are "troublesome"; they even believed that if democracy is promoted, there will be no "master," so it is better not to have democracy.

    Some people who do not quite approve of democratic cooperative management also have this view: commandism is necessary in certain situations; especially when completing an urgent task, democracy will not work, and only commandism will be effective. Zhang Laohu, the captain of the Sixth Production Team of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Urad Front Banner, said: Last year, when hoeing in the summer, because a lot of high-yield crops were planted, the superiors arranged for hoeing twice, emphasizing that delaying hoeing for one day would reduce production, and they were urged very urgently. How can the team leader not complete such an urgent task? In order to complete the task, commandism is unavoidable. Yang Erxiao, deputy director of the Minsheng First Agricultural Cooperative in Urad Front Banner, and others also expressed similar views in the discussion.

    These people's views were criticized in the discussion process.

      Members are not Children

    An article published on January 6 criticized the idea that some people regard the masses as ignorant children, believing that the masses should be "coaxed and scared," because this idea of ​​not trusting the masses hinders the establishment of a relationship of mutual trust between cooperative cadres and members. And it pointed out: the past revolutionary struggle relied on the consciousness and actions of the broad masses of the people, and today, running cooperatives in the countryside and taking the socialist road still depends on the consciousness of the peasants. Enlightening the peasants' consciousness mainly relies on persuasion and education, and coaxing and scaring cannot achieve this goal.

    Regarding the issue of punishing members and how to treat backward members, a participant in the discussion in Tongliao County wrote: Cadres who like to abuse the method of punishment to scare members mostly do not bother to analyze and study the specific situation, and become flustered when they encounter difficulties. He believes that the so-called backward members are just temporarily confused about certain things. People are not dead things, and backward members cannot always be backward. As long as we are patient and enthusiastically educate and help them, the backward members of today may become advanced members tomorrow. This is the responsibility of the cadres. If we regard them as thorns in our side and thorns in our flesh, and arbitrarily punish and attack them, that is not the attitude of treating class brothers. Zhang Gong, the production team leader of the Yongle Agricultural Cooperative in Salachi County, explained how to treat the so-called "troublesome" members based on his own experience. There was a troublesome member in his team named Zhang Hanhou, who often argued with the cooperative cadres and sometimes even refused to participate in labor for no reason. Zhang Gong regarded him as a "hooligan who must be reformed." Later, the deputy captain went to Zhang Hanhou's house to help him and learned that he was dissatisfied with the cadres because his family did not even have money to buy oil and salt. After persuasion and education and helping him overcome difficulties, he quickly changed, and now he has become a good member.

    The more urgent and difficult things are encountered,

        The more democracy should be promoted.

    In the case of performing urgent tasks, can't we talk about democracy and only take coercive measures? Guo Suqin, a member of the Jianshe Township and Jian Agricultural Cooperative in Chahar Right Wing Rear Banner, wrote an article to refute this view. This member cited an incident in her own cooperative: Last year, this cooperative planted more than 14,000 mu of wheat and oats, which all matured before the Mid-Autumn Festival due to drought. On the day before the Mid-Autumn Festival, there were still more than 7,000 mu of wheat that had not been cut down. The members asked to rest for a day to celebrate the festival. Cooperative director He Cheng was afraid of suffering losses from wind disasters, but no team member was willing to go to the fields. In such an emergency, the director did not take coercive measures. He and other cadres separately convened meetings with the members, asking everyone to calculate the details and discuss whether the grain that was about to be in their mouths should be allowed to be lost. At the same time, he asked everyone to come up with ideas. As a result, the members all agreed to seize the time to cut the wheat, and they went to the fields early the next morning. When the strong wind struck, the wheat had already been cut down. The author wrote: Democratic cooperative management should be implemented in all work. The more urgent and difficult things are, the more we should rely on everyone to come up with solutions.

    The *Neimenggu Ribao's* discussion on "democratic cooperative management" is continuing. The articles published in the past half-month only discussed a part of the issue of democratic cooperative management. Some of the issues raised by the editor of the newspaper at the beginning of the discussion, such as how can cadres listen to the opinions of the masses while adhering to principles, and how should members treat the leadership of cadres, have not yet been touched upon. If these issues can be discussed in depth in the future, it will help rural grassroots cadres and members to comprehensively understand the issue of democratic cooperative management.

### 一场有趣的讨论

专栏：在地方报纸上

    一场有趣的讨论
    内蒙古日报从去年12月19日开始，辟出了民主办社讨论会的专栏。半个多月来，已经有不少农业社主任、生产队长、农业社社员 以及农村工作人员在这个专栏里发表了自己的意见。
        究竟谁对？
    12月19日，内蒙古日报发表了一位记者的一篇文章——“到底该听谁的？”这篇文章报道了萨拉齐县东老丈营乡新胜农业社一年来发生的一些强迫命令现象。这种强迫命令的表现形式有扣工分、挤投资、扣“三类社员”（指落后社员）的帽子，等等。
    这个高级社一年来在扩大耕地面积、改良土壤、增施肥料、合理灌溉方面作出很大的成绩，保证了生产的发展。因此，社员们对于合作社基本上是满意的。但是，他们对于干部的强迫命令作风很不满意。有的社员说：我们的人、土地、牲畜、农具都进了社，谁不希望把社办好！可是头一年进社，许多规矩我们不懂，有些事情一时想不通；干部把道理讲清楚，什么都好办。可是，干部不相信我们，硬要把社员分成一、二、三类。人都爱“吃顺气饭”，干部这样哼着喝着，社员跟社干部不是越离越远了吗！
    但是，干部也有自己的苦衷，有自己的看法。新胜社的一位副主任说：我们一年到头受累，还不是为了大家！结果还挨社员骂，你说这干部该怎么当！这个社的监察委员会主任说：我们跟谁也没冤没仇，扣工分也不过是想吓唬一下。对待群众好比对待娃娃，就得连哄带吓唬，不然他们更闹翻天了！民主办社倒是好事，就怕“民主不办社”，各人只管往自己家里捞！社的另一位副主任说：强迫命令不对，人家好社员用不着强迫，对付那些挑皮的社员，不强迫就不行！春天要不是硬挤投资，地也种不上，秋天喝西北风去吧！
    社员是一种看法，社干部又是一种看法，究竟谁对呢？内蒙古日报编者要求大家来讨论讨论。
      争论的主要之点
    从半个多月的讨论情况看来，农村基层干部对于民主办社这个问题，的确是有种种不同看法的。有些基层干部实际上不赞成或者不完全赞成民主办社的原则，他们或多或少地表现了对新胜农业社的干部的同情。乌拉特前旗民主第一农业社和先锋农业社的两个干部都列举了社里某些落后社员的只抢干工分大的活，不肯干工分小的活，偷懒，糟蹋公共财产等等落后表现，主张，对那些“挑皮捣蛋”的人不能实行民主；甚至认为，发扬了民主，就没有了“主”，那还不如不民主。
    不大赞成民主办社的人还有这样一种看法，就是：强迫命令在一定情况下，是必要的；特别是在完成一项紧急任务的情况下，讲民主行不通，只有强迫命令才有效果。乌拉特前旗先锋农业社第六生产队队长张老虎说：去年夏锄的时候，因为高产作物种的多，上级布置锄两遍，强调晚锄一天就要减产，催的特别急。这样紧急的任务，当队长的怎么能不完成，为了完成任务，难免发生强迫命令。乌拉特前旗民生第一农业社副主任杨二小等在讨论中也表示了类似的看法。
    这些人的观点在讨论过程中受到了批判。
      社员不是娃娃
    1月6日发表的一篇讨论文章，批判了有些人把群众看成不懂事的娃娃，认为对待群众就得“连哄带吓”的思想，因为这种不相信群众的思想妨碍社干部和社员之间建立一种相互信任的关系。并指出：过去的革命斗争要依靠广大人民群众的自觉和行动，今天在农村办合作社走社会主义的大路，仍然要靠农民的自觉，启发农民的自觉主要依靠说服教育，连哄带吓是达不到这个目的的。
    关于处罚社员的问题和如何对待落后社员的问题，通辽县的一位参加讨论的人写道：喜欢滥用处罚的办法来吓唬社员的干部，多半是不下工夫去分析研究具体情况，一见到困难就手忙脚乱了。他认为：所谓落后社员，不过是在某些事情上一时搞不通罢了。人不是死的东西，落后社员不能永远落后，只要我们有耐心，热情地教育他们、帮助他们，今天落后的社员，明天也许能变成先进的社员。这是干部的责任。如果把他们看成眼中钉、肉中刺，任意处罚他们、打击他们，那不是对待阶级弟兄的态度。萨拉齐县永乐农业社生产队长张公根据自己的切身体会，说明了应该如何对待所谓“挑皮”社员的问题。他的队里有一个挑皮的社员叫张罕后，经常跟社干部吵嘴，有时甚至无故不参加劳动。张公把他看成是个“非改造他不可的二流子”。后来副队长到张罕后家去帮助他，了解到他因为家里连买油盐的钱都没有了，因此对干部不满意。经过说服教育和帮助他克服困难，他很快就转变了，现在已经成了一个好社员。
    越是遇到紧急难办的事
        越要发扬民主
    在执行紧急任务的情况下，是不是就不能讲民主，而只能采取强迫手段呢？察哈尔右翼后旗建设乡和建农业社社员郭素琴写稿批驳了这种看法。这个社员举出了自己合作社里的一件事：去年这个社种了一万四千多亩小麦和莜麦，因为天旱都挤在中秋节前成熟了，中秋节的前一天，还有七千多亩麦子没有割倒，社员们要求休息一天过节。社主任何成害怕遇到风灾遭受损失，可是各队社员没有一个愿意下地。在这样紧急情况下，这位主任并没有采取强迫的办法，他和其他干部分头召集社员开会，叫大家算算细账，讨论就要到口的粮食应不应该让它丢掉，同时叫大家出主意。结果社员们都赞成抓紧割麦子，第二天一早就下地。等大风袭来的时候，麦子已经割完。作者写道：民主办社应该贯彻实现到一切工作中去，越是紧急的事情和难办的事情，越要依靠大家想办法。
    内蒙古日报关于“民主办社”的讨论，正在继续进行。过去半个多月中发表的文章中所讨论的，还只是关于民主办社的一部分问题，该报编者在讨论开始的时候，所提出的部分问题，例如干部怎样才能既能倾听群众的意见，又能坚持原则；社员应该怎样对待干部的领导等等，现在还没有接触到，如果以后能对这些问题加以深入的讨论，将会帮助农村基层干部和社员全面地认识民主办社问题。
