Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, January 20th. A water turbine pump that can both pump water for irrigation and generate electricity has recently been successfully tested in Zhangting Township, Pinghe County, Fujian Province.

This dual-purpose water turbine pump can irrigate 320 mu of farmland and generate 4 kilowatts of electricity.

The water turbine pump was converted from an ordinary water pump for pumping water. Hydroelectric technicians Zhou Shengxin and others raised the axis of the water pump by 1.2 meters, and installed a pulley and a generator. When the water turbine rotates, it drives the generator to generate electricity.

    灌田发电两用水轮泵
    在福建试验成功
    新华社福州20日电　一架能抽水灌田又能发电的水轮泵最近在福建省平和县漳汀乡试验成功。
    这架两用的水轮泵，能灌田三百二十亩，发电四瓩。
    水轮泵是由普通抽水的水泵改造的。水电技术人员周盛新等把水泵的轴心提高了一点二公尺，并且装上一个皮带轮和发电机，水轮机转动时带动发电机就能发电。
