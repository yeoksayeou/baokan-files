    Both Frugal and Lively
    Over Two Thousand Agricultural Cooperatives in Shangrao Prefecture Prepare to Celebrate the Spring Festival
    (Our Newspaper News) More than 2,200 agricultural cooperatives in Shangrao Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, are actively taking measures to allow their members to spend the Spring Festival frugally and lively. The Tianshan Agricultural Cooperative in Poyang County has already distributed more than 5,000 yuan from sideline income to its members, averaging 6.6 yuan per person; in addition, a sum of money has been set aside to subsidize widowed, orphaned, and childless households. The Gongyu Agricultural Cooperative in Hengfeng County recently organized the labor force in the cooperative to drain the water from seven fish ponds. Besides selling some of the caught fish, more than 400 jin of fresh fish were kept to be distributed to the members for consumption during the Spring Festival. The agricultural cooperatives in Zouyuan Township, Yugan County, plan to slaughter several fat pigs themselves to provide meat for the members, averaging two jin of pork per person.
    Around the Spring Festival, many agricultural cooperatives will carry out various recreational activities. Amateur theater troupes and clubs in many agricultural cooperatives in Dongxiang County have rehearsed collective dances, local operas, and ditties, and are preparing to perform them during the Spring Festival celebrations.
    In order to avoid extravagance and waste, the members of the agricultural cooperatives have also taken the initiative to propose celebrating the Spring Festival as frugally as possible. The 758 households of the Shengli Agricultural Cooperative in Geyuan Town, Hengfeng County, a famous old revolutionary base area, have consciously proposed not to burn incense paper, to avoid extravagance and waste when entertaining guests, and to make less rice cakes and rice wine, etc. According to preliminary estimates, the whole cooperative will save more than 4,000 yuan, while still being able to celebrate the Spring Festival lively.

    既要俭朴，又要热闹
    上饶专区二千多农业社准备欢度春节
    本报讯　江西上饶专区的二千二百多个农业社，积极采取措施，让社员们俭朴而又热闹地度过春节。鄱阳县田坂农业社，已经把五千多元副业款项分给社员，平均每人可得六元六角；另外还抽出一笔钱补助鳏寡孤独户。横峰县共裕农业社，最近组织社里的劳动力，将七口鱼塘里的水车干，捉到的鱼除卖出一部分外，留下四百多斤鲜鱼分给社员们在春节时食用。余干县邹源乡各农业社准备自宰几头肥猪，供社员们食用，平均每个人能分到二斤猪肉。
    在春节前后，许多农业社将开展多种文娱活动。东乡县许多农业社的业余剧团和俱乐部，已排练好集体舞和地方戏曲、小调等节目，准备在春节联欢的时候上演。
    为了避免铺张浪费，各农业社的社员们还主动提出尽可能俭朴地欢度春节。著名的革命老根据地横峰县葛源镇胜利农业社的七百五十八户社员，自觉提出不烧香纸，请客不铺张浪费，少做一些米粿、米酒等。据初步估计，全社共节省四千多元，而春节仍可以过得热热闹闹。　（司马牧牛）
