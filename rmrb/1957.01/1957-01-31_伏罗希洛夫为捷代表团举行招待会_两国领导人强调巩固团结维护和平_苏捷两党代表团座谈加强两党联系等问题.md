Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th - Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, said at a reception held on the 29th for the delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic: "Consolidating the unity of the socialist camp is of particular importance to the struggle of the people of all countries for peace, security and freedom. The solidarity of the people of the socialist countries is the most important and solid bulwark against the recklessness of the warmongers.” The talks between the Soviet Union and the delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic, as well as the earlier talks with the government delegations of Poland, Romania, the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China, "are milestone events in strengthening the unity between these countries and promoting peace and security for all peoples."

Voroshilov was speaking at a reception held in the Moscow Kremlin for the Czechoslovak delegation before the signing of the Soviet-Czechoslovak Joint Declaration. In his speech at the reception, he also spoke about the recent developments in the international situation. He emphasized that the failed armed aggression against Egypt and the instigation of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary by certain countries have not stopped certain forces, who are bent on disrupting the peaceful lives of all peoples, from taking further actions. At present, the purpose of the plan openly promoted across the ocean (the "Eisenhower Plan") is to enslave the peoples of the Middle East and deprive them of their national independence. The United States is also planning to station its atomic support task forces in Western Europe, Turkey, Iran and Japan. Voroshilov said: "There is no doubt that this entire clamorous campaign launched by American figures and newspapers is merely a restoration of the bankrupt 'position of strength' policy." The revival of German militarism is also a serious threat to peace. Obviously, anyone who values peace and the security of the people cannot be indifferent to this situation.

Voroshilov said that the Soviet Union will continue to work tirelessly to end the arms race and ensure lasting peace in the world.

President Zápotocký of the Czechoslovak Republic then spoke. He said that during the talks, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union had a completely unified view on issues such as international policy, the unity of socialist countries, and the relations between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. He said that in our policies, we always submit to the interests of the Czech and Slovak peoples. These interests are all subordinate to a common idea, to the struggle against any aggression or oppression, to the struggle to maintain and consolidate world peace, and to the struggle for a better future for the working people of the world.

The reception was very warm. About 1,500 people attended the reception. Music and dance performances were held after the reception.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th - According to TASS, Moscow: Delegations of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia held a symposium on the 29th to discuss issues such as further developing and strengthening ties between the two parties and certain issues in the current international workers' movement. The two parties had completely identical views on all the issues discussed.

The representatives of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union who participated in the symposium were: Khrushchev, Suslov, etc. The representatives of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia were: Novotný, Zápotocký, Široký, Kopecký, Hendrych, etc.

    苏捷两党代表团座谈加强两党联系等问题
    新华社莫斯科30日电　苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫29日在为捷克斯洛伐克共和国代表团举行的招待会上说：“巩固社会主义阵营的团结，对于各国人民争取和平、安全和自由的斗争具有特别重要的意义。社会主义国家人民的团结一致是阻止战争贩子蠢动的最主要和坚实的屏幛。”苏联同捷克斯洛伐克共和国代表团的会谈，以及早些时候同波兰、罗马尼亚、德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国政府代表团的会谈，“是在加强这些国家之间的团结以及促进各国人民的和平和安全方面的具有里程碑意义的事件。”
    伏罗希洛夫是在苏捷联合宣言签字以前在莫斯科克里姆林宫为捷克斯洛伐克代表团举行招待会的。他在招待会上讲话时，还谈到了最近国际局势的发展。他强调指出，某些国家对埃及的武装侵略和制造匈牙利反革命叛乱的失败，并没有使得一心想扰乱各国人民的和平生活的某些势力不再采取进一步的行动。目前，在大洋对面公开宣传的计划（“艾森豪威尔计划”）的目的，就是要奴役中东各国人民和剥夺他们的民族独立。美国还正计划在西欧、土耳其、伊朗和日本驻扎它的原子支援特遣部队。伏罗希洛夫说：“毫无疑问，由美国人士和报纸发动的整个这种叫嚷运动，只不过是恢复已经破产的‘实力地位’政策”。复活德国军国主义也是对和平的一个严重威胁。显然，任何珍视和平和人民安全的人，都不能对这种局势漠不关心。
    伏罗希洛夫说，苏联将继续坚持不懈地为结束军备竞赛和确保世界的持久和平而努力。
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统萨波托斯基接着讲了话。他说，在会谈期间，捷苏两国对国际政策，社会主义国家的团结和捷克斯洛伐克和苏联之间的关系等问题有完全一致的看法。他说，在我们的政策上，我们始终服从捷克和斯洛伐克人民的利益。这些利益都服从于一种共同的思想，服从于反抗任何侵略或压迫的斗争，服从于为了维护和巩固世界和平而进行的斗争，服从于为了全世界劳动人民获得更美好的将来而进行的斗争。
    这次招待会进行得非常热烈。出席招待会的约有一千五百人。招待会结束后举行了音乐和舞蹈表演。
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党代表团和捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表团29日举行座谈会，讨论了进一步发展和加强两党之间的联系的问题以及当前国际工人运动中的某些问题。两党对所有谈到的问题的意见完全一致。
    参加座谈会的苏联共产党方面的代表有：赫鲁晓夫，苏斯洛夫等，捷克斯洛伐克共产党方面有：诺沃提尼，萨波托斯基，西罗基，柯别茨基，亨德里赫等。
