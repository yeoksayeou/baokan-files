Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 17th: Farmers in Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, are receiving the grain and cash distributed from the first year of advanced cooperativization to welcome the Spring Festival.

Last year, Zhaodong County saw an unprecedented high grain yield, with unit area yield 8.6% higher than in 1955. With the exception of disaster areas, all agricultural cooperatives in the county increased production, and 80% of the members increased their income. Zhao Da, First Secretary of the Zhaodong County Committee of the Communist Party of China, told Xinhua reporters that cooperativization enabled Zhaodong County to overcome last year's floods and achieve increased production. Due to vigorous technical reforms, new phenomena have emerged in rural areas, such as more mixed planting, more fertilization, more promotion of improved varieties, more women participating in labor, and less land abandonment, fewer missing seedlings, fewer idle people, and a reduction in impoverished households. Farmers' lives have improved, and households in difficulty and "five-guarantee households" have received living subsidies and care. The province completed the task of paying public grain and state grain purchases more than half a month ahead of schedule.

Zhaodong County is close to the Songhua River and encountered major floods three times last year. More than 53,000 organized farmers fought day and night against the flood for more than 20 consecutive days, building nearly 20 miles of dikes in two days and nights, blocking the flood and protecting the crops. At this time, it was the busy farming season, and more than 34,000 young and middle-aged women in the county bravely took on the farming tasks left by the men, strengthened field management, and ensured the growth of crops. Subsequently, farmers in disaster areas generally developed sideline production, and non-disaster areas also developed diversified operations. Now most agricultural cooperatives have herds of livestock, pigs, and flocks of chickens and ducks. Cooperativization has greatly increased the strength of the farmers. In the past, farmers were afraid of water and avoided it, but now they use water to serve production. Last year, the county diverted water from the Songhua River to open up nearly 700 hectares of paddy fields; at the same time, for the first time, more than 15,000 hectares of alkaline land were transformed into fertile land, thus ensuring the increase in total grain output in the county.

### 实现合作化后粮食空前增产  肇东农业社社员正在领钱领粮迎接春节

    实现合作化后粮食空前增产
    肇东农业社社员正在领钱领粮迎接春节
    据新华社哈尔滨17日电　黑龙江省肇东县农民正在领取高级合作化第一年所分得的粮食和现金，迎接春节。
    去年，肇东县出现了历年未有的粮食高产量，单位面积产量要比1955年高8.6％。除灾区以外，全县每个农业社都增产了，80％的社员增加了收入。中共肇东县委第一书记赵达告诉新华社记者说：合作化使肇东县战胜去年的洪水，得到了增产。由于大力进行技术改革，农村里出现了混种多、施肥多、推广良种多、妇女参加劳动多，以及丢地少、缺苗断条少、闲人少、贫困户减少等新气象。农民生活得到改善，困难户和“五保户”得到了生活补助和照顾。全省提前半个多月完成缴纳公粮和国家购粮的任务。
    肇东县靠近松花江畔，去年曾经三度遇到大水。组织起来的五万三千多农民，连续二十多天日夜不停地和大水作斗争，在两昼夜间修成近二十里的堤坝，挡住了洪水，保护了庄稼。这时正是农忙季节，全县三万四千多青壮年妇女，奋勇地把男人留下的庄稼活担当起来，加强了田间管理工作，保证了农作物的生长。接着，灾区农民普遍开展了副业生产，非灾区也开展了多种经营。现在多数农业社有了牧群、猪群和鸡鸭群。合作化使农民增加了很大的力量。农民过去是怕水躲水，现在是引水为生产服务，去年全县就引松花江水多开了近七百公顷水田；同时第一次把一万五千多公顷碱地改成良田，这样就保证了全县粮食总产量的增加。
