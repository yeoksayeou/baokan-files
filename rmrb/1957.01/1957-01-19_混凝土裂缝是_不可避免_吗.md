Are Concrete Cracks "Inevitable"?
    Hu Gongpu

Last year, I went to Guangzhou and had contact with twenty or thirty civil engineering technical personnel in Guangdong Province. Among them were chief engineers and director engineers from bureau-level organizations, chief engineers and consulting engineers from design institutes and engineering companies, as well as general engineers and technicians. The majority of these engineering and technical personnel believed that "concrete (including reinforced concrete) cracks are not a big deal, and are inevitable in the South." They even found all sorts of "grounds" for themselves. It is said that in recent years, eighty to ninety percent of concrete projects in Guangdong have cracked, and they regard this as "practical grounds." They also said that books state: "Any concrete will definitely show many cracks under a microscope." They use this as "theoretical grounds." Therefore, they turn a blind eye to the widespread cracking of concrete projects.

I believe that all these "grounds" are untenable. There are also some concrete projects in Guangdong Province that have no cracks because of good construction and maintenance. How can it be said that "concrete cracks in the South are inevitable"?

As for their "theoretical grounds," it is even more absurd. Seeing concrete cracks under a microscope is one thing, and seeing concrete cracks with the naked eye is another. Most of the concrete cracks in Guangdong Province are visible to the naked eye. For example, in the newly built third paper machine workshop of the Guangzhou Paper Mill, there are seven or eight hundred cracks, three to five meters long and one to three millimeters wide, on the 2,000 square meter factory roof. How can it be said that this kind of crack is also "inevitable"?

Concrete cracks will at least reduce the service life, and in severe cases can cause buildings to collapse. I hope that civil engineering technical personnel in Guangdong Province will face up to this problem and solve the problem of concrete cracks.

### 混凝土裂缝是“不可避免”吗

    混凝土裂缝是“不可避免”吗
    胡公仆
    去年，我曾到广州去过一次，接触了二、三十个广东省地区土木建筑工程技术人员。其中有局级机关的总工程师、主任工程师，有设计院和工程公司的总工程师、顾问工程师、主任工程师，有一般的工程师和技术员。这些工程技术人员中，大多数都认为“混凝土（包括钢筋混凝土）裂缝，没有什么了不起，在南方是不可避免的。”他们还给自己找到了各种各样的“根据”。据说近几年来，广东混凝土工程中百分之八、九十都裂了缝，他们把这点视作“实践根据。”又说书本上讲过：“任何混凝土在显微镜下，一定能看到很多裂纹。”他们以此作为“理论根据”。因而对大量混凝土工程的裂缝现象视若无睹。
    我认为所有这些“根据”都是站不住脚的。广东省也有一些混凝土工程因为施工好，养护好，没有裂缝。这怎能说“在南方的混凝土工程裂缝是不可避免的”呢？
    至于他们的“理论根据”，更是荒唐。在显微镜下看见混凝土工程裂缝是一回事，在肉眼下看见混凝土工程裂缝又是另一回事。广东省大部分混凝土工程裂缝都是肉眼看见的。像广州造纸厂新建第三抄纸车间，在两千平方公尺的厂房屋面上，裂了七八百条长三至五公尺、宽一至三公厘的裂缝。怎么能说这种裂缝也是“不可避免”的呢？
    混凝土裂缝，至少会减少使用寿命，严重的可以造成建筑物倒塌。希望广东省土木建筑工程技术人员正视这个问题，解决混凝土工程的裂缝问题。
