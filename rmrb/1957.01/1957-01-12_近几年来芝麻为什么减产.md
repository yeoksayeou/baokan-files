In recent years, sesame products have decreased, and sesame oil is no longer as fragrant. Regions that are accustomed to eating sesame oil have partially or completely switched to peanut oil.

Why has this phenomenon occurred? Is it because sesame exports have increased significantly? No, exports in 1955 decreased by 24.5% compared to 1950. Increased consumption due to the improved living standards of urban and rural people is one reason; but the main reason is that production has increased slowly, and in some cases, it has even decreased. Sesame production in 1955 decreased by 11.04% compared to 1953, only equivalent to half of the pre-war level. Why has sesame production decreased? Based on my understanding of the situation in Henan Province and other major sesame-producing areas, the main reasons are as follows:

First, the yield per unit area of sesame is lower than that of other crops, resulting in lower income from growing sesame. In recent years, the national average yield per unit area of sesame has consistently failed to reach pre-war levels. From 1933 to 1936, the lowest yield was 76 jin per mu, and the highest was 82 jin, with an average of 79.3 jin over the four years. However, from 1950 to 1955, the lowest was 29 jin, and the highest was 64 jin, with the six-year average being 34.1% lower than the pre-war level, and 40.5% lower in Henan Province, leading to a decrease in income for sesame farmers. The price of sesame is also unreasonable. One hundred jin of sesame yields 47 to 50 jin of oil, while peanuts yield about 42 jin of oil, but in many regions, sesame and peanuts have the same price, or even sesame prices are lower than peanut prices. This phenomenon is most serious in Henan Province, where the average price per hundred jin is: peanuts 18.14 yuan, sesame 17.77 yuan. This is due to the fact that after the price of oilseeds decreased in 1952, peanut prices have been raised by 5.4%-18.6%, while sesame prices have not been raised accordingly. In the main producing areas, the amount of wheat exchanged for sesame decreased from 45 jin to 76.5 jin in 1955 compared to 1951, and the exchange rate for peanuts dropped from 120 jin to 100 jin with no difference in value, meaning that high quality did not get a high price. For example, in Chenlou Village Youth Agricultural Cooperative in Shuitun Township, Runan County, Henan Province, the profit from planting one mu of sesame was only 0.95 yuan, a very small profit; the profit from planting soybeans was 4.5 yuan, with a profit rate equivalent to 44.76% of the expenses; and the profit from planting wheat was 9.4 yuan, with a profit equivalent to 77.23% of the expenses. In Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Damiao Township of the same county, the profit rate from planting cotton and soybeans exceeded that of sesame by 57.3%-65.8%. It is understood that similar situations exist in other regions. The profit from planting cotton far exceeds that from sesame. For example, in Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Laozumiao Township, Runan County, Henan Province, the harvest value of cotton per mu was 90 yuan; the output value of sesame (158 jin) was 23 yuan, and the output value of wheat (200 jin) was 18 yuan. The total income from autumn and winter was 41 yuan, which is less than half of the income from planting cotton. As a result, the cotton planting area has expanded more than thirteen times; and many sesame fields have been converted to other crops.

Second, insufficient attention has been paid to the planned guidance of sesame production. A few years ago, sesame was included in the national major crop plan, but it was removed in 1955. As a result, many areas squeezed out sesame when arranging agricultural production. For example, in Yachen Village, Pingyuan County, Shandong Province, planting was based on the plans passed down from higher levels, and the plans for other crops were complete, but there was no plan for sesame. As a result, 50 mu were planted the year before last, but none were planted last year. In Xinyang area of Henan Province, the sesame planting area decreased by 16.2% in 1955 compared to 1953, and Runan, a major producing county, decreased by 23%.

Third, some sesame-growing farmers did not receive the support they deserved. After the unified purchase and sale of grain, sesame growers who lacked grain were classified as general grain-deficient households, and were allowed to purchase less grain than those who grew cotton or tobacco. Some counties made arrangements for sesame production, but the townships and cooperatives did not follow through. For example, the person in charge of Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Damiao Township, Runan County, said: "There is no fertilizer for growing sesame, and we can't get enough grain to eat. The county only arranges for planting, but doesn't solve our difficulties, so we can only plant it in low-lying areas!" As a result, all 80 mu of sesame were planted in low-lying areas and were flooded. In many areas, support for sesame production has been neglected in terms of loans, fertilizer loans, and other work.

Some economic workers in Henan Province believe that "the economic value of sesame is not as high as that of peanuts. One mu of peanuts produces 110 jin, worth about 20 yuan, while sesame produces about 90 jin, worth about 16 yuan. Peanuts add more wealth to society than sesame." They arrange prices based on this. They do not recognize that if sesame prices are reasonably adjusted and production management is strengthened, production will increase. It is not comprehensive to view the problem solely from the perspective of low yield. The formulation of price policies should focus on the needs of the country in many aspects and should not only emphasize the development of high-yield crops. Some crops, although not high-yielding, are closely related to people's lives and should also be appropriately developed.

The soil and climate in the central plains of China are suitable for growing sesame, and farmers also have experience in growing sesame. Growing sesame can fertilize the fields and is also beneficial to the growth of subsequent crops. In the future, effective measures should be taken to encourage and support sesame production from various aspects.

    近几年来芝麻为什么减产
    曹士魁
    近年来，芝麻制品减少了，香油（芝麻油）不香了，习惯吃香油的地区已经部分或全部供应花生油。
    为什么会发生这种现象呢？是不是芝麻出口多了？不是的，1955年出口较1950年还减少了24.5％。城乡人民生活水平提高消费量增加是原因之一；但主要还是增产比较慢，有的反而减产了。芝麻产量1955年较1953年减产11.04％，仅相当战前的二分之一。芝麻为什么减产了呢？据我去芝麻主要产区河南省等地了解到的情况看，主要的有以下几点：
    第一、芝麻单位面积产量比别的农作物低，种芝麻收入少。近几年来，全国芝麻平均单位面积产量始终没有达到战前水平。1933年至1936年每亩最低产七十六斤，最高产八十二斤，四年平均七十九点三斤。但1950年至1955年最低二十九斤、最高六十四斤，六年平均较战前低34.1％，河南省低40.5％，种芝麻的农民收入减少。芝麻价格也不合理，一百斤芝麻出油四十七到五十斤，花生出油四十二斤左右，但芝麻、花生在不少地区一个价格，甚至芝麻价低于花生价。这种现象在河南省最严重，全省一百斤平均价：花生十八元一角四，芝麻十七元七角七。这是1952年油料价格下降后，花生已上提5.4％—18.6％，而芝麻没有相应提价所形成的。主要产地芝麻换小麦，1955年比1951年减少四十五斤至七十六点五斤，换花生由一百二十斤而降为百斤换百斤毫无差额，优质得不到优价。如：河南省汝南县水屯乡陈楼村青年农业社种一亩芝麻仅有九角五分的收益，利润很小；种黄豆有四元五角的收益，利润率相当于开支的44.76％；种小麦收益九元四角，利润相当于开支的77.23％。该县大庙乡前进农业社种棉花大豆利润率超过种芝麻57.3％—65.8％，据了解，其他地区也有类似情况。种棉花利润远远超过芝麻。如河南汝南县老祖庙乡红光农业社，每亩棉花收获值九十元；芝麻产值（一百五十八斤）二十三元，小麦产值（二百斤）十八元，秋冬两季共收入四十一元，种芝麻不及种棉花收入的一半。结果棉花种植面积扩大十三倍多；许多芝麻地改种了其他作物。
    第二、对芝麻生产的计划指导不够重视。前几年芝麻被列入国家主要农作物计划内，1955年取消了。结果，安排农业生产的时候，不少地区把芝麻挤掉。如山东省平原县鸭陈村根据上级层层下达的计划播种，其他农作物计划齐全，唯有芝麻无计划。结果，前年种五十亩，去年一亩也没种。河南信阳地区芝麻种植面积1955年较1953年下降16.2％，主产县汝南下降23％。
    第三、有些种芝麻的农户得不到应有的支持。粮食统购统销以后，因种芝麻缺粮者，划为一般缺粮户，较种棉、烟缺粮者准许购买的口粮少。有的县内安排了芝麻生产，乡社也不照办。如：汝南县大庙乡前进农业社负责人谈：“种芝麻无肥料，也吃不到粮食，县只布置种，不给解决困难问题，就种到洼地里去吧！”结果，将八十亩芝麻全部种到洼地，被水淹了。不少地区在贷款、贷肥料等工作上，忽视扶植芝麻生产。
    河南省有些经济工作人员认为，“芝麻的经济价值不如花生，一亩花生产一百一十斤，约值二十元，芝麻九十斤左右，约值十六元，花生给社会增加的财富大于芝麻。”他们就以此安排价格。他们没有认识到：如果芝麻价格合理调整、加强生产管理以后，是会增产的。单纯从产量低看问题是不全面的。制定价格政策应从国家多方面需要着眼，不应只强调高产作物的发展。有些作物产量虽不高，但同人民生活有密切关系，也应当适当发展。
    我国中原地带土壤气候适宜种芝麻，农民也有种芝麻的经验；种芝麻能肥沃田地，也有利于后茬作物的生长。今后，对芝麻的生产应采取有效措施，从多方面鼓励扶植。
