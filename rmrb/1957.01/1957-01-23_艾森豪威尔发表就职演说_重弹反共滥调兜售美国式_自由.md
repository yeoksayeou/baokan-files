Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 22nd—Eisenhower and Nixon were sworn in as President and Vice President of the United States respectively on the 21st. Eisenhower also delivered his inaugural address to Congress.

The main theme of Eisenhower's inaugural address was to oppose communism and promote the "gospel" of American "freedom." He emphasized that America's task is to guide the world to establish a "free" order.

Eisenhower praised the "will" of the "heroes" who participated in the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary, extolled the bloodshed caused by the counter-revolutionaries in Budapest as a "shining symbol of the desire for freedom," and said that the United States "must not abandon them."

Eisenhower said that in order to achieve "peace," the United States must pay a price, which is: the United States "must pay" the "cost of its necessary military strength" and "help build the security of other countries." The United States must also "play a responsible role in major world events or conflicts, whether these events involve vast regions, the fate of a Pacific island, or the use of a canal in the Middle East." The United States also needs to use its "financial resources" to "help" those regions "no matter how far they are from our shores."

In the last part of his speech, Eisenhower further annotated his "freedom" and "justice." With the hope of instigating new counter-revolutionary riots in socialist countries, he declared without concealment that the United States "respects" the "wishes of those countries that yearn for freedom" and awaits them with "enthusiastic welcome" to "rejoin the ranks of freedom." He even said that the United States "respects the Russian people" and "hopes they will succeed in demanding greater spiritual freedom."

    艾森豪威尔发表就职演说
    重弹反共滥调兜售美国式“自由”
    据新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：艾森豪威尔和尼克松在21日分别宣誓就任本届美国总统和副总统。艾森豪威尔并且在国会发表了就职演说。
    艾森豪威尔就职演说通篇的主旨是反对共产主义和宣扬美国的“自由”的“福音”。他强调美国的任务是要引导全世界建立“自由”的秩序。
    艾森豪威尔赞美参加匈牙利反革命暴乱的“英雄们”的“意志”，歌颂布达佩斯反革命分子所造成的流血事件是“渴望自由的光辉象征”，而美国“绝不能背弃他们”。
    艾森豪威尔说，为了实现“和平”，美国必须偿付代价，这就是：美国“必须付出”它“必需的军事力量的费用”，“并且帮助建立其他国家的安全”。美国还必须“在大的世界事件或者冲突中起负责的作用，不管这些事件是涉及广大地区的事件，是太平洋的一个岛屿的命运，还是使用中东的一条运河”。美国也需要动用它的“财力”来“帮助”那些“不管离我们的海岸有多么远”的地区。
    艾森豪威尔在他的演说的最后一部分为他的“自由”和“正义”作了进一步的注解。他怀着在社会主义国家鼓动新的反革命暴乱的希望，毫不掩饰地声明：美国“尊重”那些“向往着自由的那些国家的愿望”，以“热情的欢迎”等待着它们“再度参加自由的行列”。他甚至说，美国是“尊敬俄国人民的”，并且“希望他们在要求取得较大的精神自由”方面能够成功。
