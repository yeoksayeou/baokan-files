The Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Practices Thrift
Principal Responsible Cadres Take the Lead

(Our Dispatch) In order to promote a mass movement for streamlining and thrift, the departments of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee took the lead by conducting a comprehensive review of the waste in financial expenditures and administrative management over the past year, and made improvements while conducting the review.

The principal responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee are able to practice thrift themselves. For example, Comrade Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and Comrade Xia Zhengong, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, whose residences are relatively close to their offices, have recently been walking to and from work instead of using cars. Under the influence of the leading cadres of various departments and commissions, they generally do not use cars for non-urgent matters. Some departments, such as the Political and Legal Department, have not used a car once in the past week. According to statistics from December of last year, the fuel consumption of the Provincial Party Committee's vehicles has been reduced by more than 20% compared to the past. The Provincial Party Committee General Office had originally ordered furniture, but returned fifty desks, fifty round dining tables, and seventy-five coffee tables, worth 8,750 yuan. The Confidential Office voluntarily returned unused bicycles, wall clocks, and other items to the management department.

Currently, the General Office of the Provincial Party Committee is working on formulating a plan for thrift in the organization. It is planned to adjust twenty rooms under the existing staffing, so that the United Front Work Department can also concentrate its work in the Provincial Party Committee compound. This will not only free up a certain number of houses, but also reduce twenty telephone sets, saving the state electricity costs. (Cai Wenlin)

    中共山东省委厉行节约
    主要负责干部以身作则
    本报讯　为了推动群众性的精简节约运动，中共山东省委机关各部门首先带头，普遍检查了过去一年来财政开支和行政管理方面的浪费现象，并做到了边检查边改进。
    省委主要负责同志都能以身作则厉行节约。如省委第一书记舒同、省委书记夏征农等同志，他们的宿舍，离办公室比较近，近来上下班都是徒步往来，不乘坐小汽车。各部、委负责同志，在他们的带头影响下，没有紧要事情，一般外出都不乘小汽车。有的部门，如政法部，最近一周内都未出过一次小汽车。据去年12月份的统计，省委机关的汽车耗油量，比过去降低了20％以上。省委办公厅行政处原已订购的家具，已退回了写字台五十张、饭厅里用的圆桌五十张、茶几七十五个，价值八千七百五十元。机要处把用不着的自行车、挂钟等，都主动地交回了管理部门。
    目前，省委办公厅正着手研究制定机关节约方案。计划在现有人员的情况下，调整出来二十个房间，使统战部也可集中在省委办公大院办公。这样，不仅能腾出一定数量的房子，而且可减去二十部电话机，为国家节约电费。　（蔡文霖）
