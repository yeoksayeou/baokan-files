Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 24th: The Yangtze River's water level is currently gradually dropping towards its annual lowest point. In order to ensure smooth passage for ships during the river's shallowest period, over 150 channel surveying personnel along the Yangtze are braving wind and snow to measure channel depth. Eight dredgers, including bucket, suction, and grab dredgers, are working day and night in various shallow water channels to excavate riverbed silt. Several blasting teams are working to clear shoals. So far this dry season, they have dredged 58% more riverbed silt than during the same period last year.

    利用枯水季节疏浚长江航道
    新华社武汉24日电　目前长江江水正在逐渐向每年的最低水位降落。为了保证来往船只在江水最浅的时候仍然能畅通，现在，长江沿线有一百五十多个航道测量工作人员正在冒着风雪，测量航道水深；有八艘键斗、吸扬、抓扬等挖泥船正在各浅水航道处日夜不息地挖掘江底淤泥；有数十个爆破队员正在炸浅滩。到目前为止，他们在这一枯水季节里已经挖出的江底淤泥，比去年同期多了58％以上。
