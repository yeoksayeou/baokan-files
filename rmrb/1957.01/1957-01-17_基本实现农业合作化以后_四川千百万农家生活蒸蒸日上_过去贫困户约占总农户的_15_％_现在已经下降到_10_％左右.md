Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 16th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Chao reported: In Sichuan's rural areas, the first year after the basic realization of agricultural cooperation, farmers' lives are gradually improving, and the lives of millions of households are getting better day by day.

　　On the 11th, at the Sichuan Province 1956 Conference of Advanced Workers in Agriculture, Forestry, Water Conservancy, and Meteorology Systems, Liao Zhigao, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out a figure that aroused everyone's interest. In the past, poor households accounted for about 15% of the total number of farmers in the province, but now that has dropped to about 10%.

　　The typical survey materials made by the Wanxian Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in Liangping County also illustrate this change in rural areas. The material pointed out that farmers there, in the past year, in addition to selling more surplus grain and fat pigs to the state, the amount of grain they ate and used increased by 34% compared with the previous year, the amount of oil they ate increased by about half, and the amount of salt and cloth they used also increased by more than 10%.

　　The reporter visited rural areas and found that many farmers' homes had purchased thermos bottles, flashlights, and enamel basins. In a cooperative in Fengchu Township, Renshou County, with eighty-two households, there are now more than seventy flashlights and more than forty pairs of rubber shoes in use. Many people in rural areas are sewing new clothes and adding new quilts. Due to the increase in the number of farmers buying cloth and daily necessities, the sales volume of cloth and general merchandise in rural areas throughout the province last year increased by 8% compared with 1955.

　　Last year, the number of rural deposit accounts in the People's Bank increased. Shuangliu County is a small county, and the number of farmer deposit accounts last year increased by more than 910 households compared with the previous year. Due to the increase in farmer deposits throughout the province last year, the bank deposit figure (after offsetting deposits and loans) increased by 77% compared with the previous year.

　　Because life is flourishing, a joyful scene is emerging in rural areas. Members of the Xin'dian First Agricultural Cooperative in Mingshan County said that today's life has four more: more grain is distributed, more cash is distributed, more new clothes are sewn, and more new cotton wool is added. A poor peasant named Li Hongduan in Tongjiang County used to quarrel with his wife frequently because of the difficulties of life. Last year, he joined the cooperative, and the family's income increased by more than 50% compared with the previous year. They added new clothes and quilts, the couple reconciled, and for the first time, they deposited more than 30 yuan of surplus funds into the bank. In addition to improving their own lives, more than 800 members of the twelve cooperatives in Guachu Township, Renshou County, invested an average of seven yuan in cash in the cooperative. Li Jinggao, an elderly member of the Gaojia Agricultural Cooperative in this township who is over seventy years old, saw the improvement of rural life today and said to everyone he met: "Cooperation has brought about happy events, and I will live longer!"

　　Before the spring plowing last year, Sichuan Province basically realized the primary cooperation, and the number of farmer households joining the cooperatives reached 74.7% of the total number of agricultural households in the province. On the basis of cooperation, the total grain output of the province last year increased by 4.04 billion catties. The total income of farmers in the province from agriculture and sideline occupations last year increased by more than 16% compared with 1955 (including the income from price increases of agricultural and sideline products), thus providing a material basis for improving farmers' lives.

    基本实现农业合作化以后
    四川千百万农家生活蒸蒸日上
    过去贫困户约占总农户的15％　现在已经下降到10％左右
    新华社成都16日电　新华社记者李朝报道：基本实现农业合作化第一年的四川农村，农民的生活是在逐步地上升，千百万户农家的光景过得一天比一天好。
    11日，在四川省1956年农、林、水利、气象系统先进工作者代表会议上，中共四川省委员会书记处书记廖志高指出了一个引起大家兴趣的数字。过去全省约占总农户15％的贫困户，现在已经下降到了10％左右。
    中共万县地委在梁平县作的典型调查材料，也说明了农村这种变化。材料指出：那里的农民在去年内，除了卖给国家更多的余粮和肥猪以外，自己吃粮和用粮的数量比前年增加34％，吃油的数量增加一半左右，吃盐、用布的数量也增加10％以上。
    记者走访了农村，发现许多农民家里购买了热水瓶、电筒、磁盆。仁寿县蜂出乡一个八十二户的合作社中，现在在用的共有七十多只电筒、四十多双胶鞋。农村中缝新衣，添新被的很多。由于农民买布和购买日用品的数量增加，去年全省农村布匹和百货销售量比1955年增加了8％。
    去年人民银行的农村存款户增多了。双流县是个小县，去年农民存款户就比前年多了九百一十多户。全省去年由于农民存款增加，银行存款（存、放款相抵以后）数字共比前年增加77％。
    因为生活蒸蒸日上，农村中呈现出喜气洋洋的景象。名山县新店第一农业社社员说，今天的生活有四多：粮食分得多，现金分得多，新衣缝得多，新棉絮添得多。通江县一户名叫李洪端的贫农，原来因为生活比较困难，夫妻经常吵架，去年入了社，全家收入比前年增加50％以上。添置新衣新被，夫妻和好，还第一次把三十多元余资存入银行。仁寿县挂出乡十二个社八百多户社员除了改善自己的生活以外，每户平均还向社里投资现金七元。这个乡高家农业社有一位七十多岁的老社员李敬高，他看到今天农村生活上升，见人便说：“办了合作社，出现高兴事，我也要添寿啦！”
    去年春耕以前，四川省就基本上实现了初级合作化，入社农户达到全省农业总户数74.7％。在合作化的基础上，去年全省粮食总产量增加四十亿零四千万斤。全省农民去年农业副业总收入比1955年增加16％以上（包括农副产品提价的收入），这样，便为改善农民生活提供了物质基础。
