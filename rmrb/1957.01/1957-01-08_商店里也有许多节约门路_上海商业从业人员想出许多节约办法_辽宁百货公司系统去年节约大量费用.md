Stores Also Have Many Ways to Save Money
Shanghai Commercial Employees Come Up with Many Ways to Save Money
Liaoning Department Store System Saved a Lot of Money Last Year

(By Our Newspaper) As the increase production and practice economy campaign develops, many stories of thrift have emerged in state-owned and joint state-private stores in Shanghai. Wang Fushun, an elderly administrator in the waste material room of the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Stationery Wholesale Store, saw that many empty wooden boxes in the store were being broken up and sold to wooden box shops as waste material for eight fen per jin (a Chinese unit of weight, approximately 0.5 kg). He thought that if the wooden boxes were sold directly to the manufacturing factory without being broken up, they could be sold for 1 jiao and 5 fen per jin. And the factory's price for recycling old wooden boxes would also be much cheaper than buying them from board box shops. After this suggestion was adopted by the administration, it saved about 1,200 yuan in November 1956 alone. Qian Guanglin, a clerk in the Secretarial Section of the Shanghai Jewelry and Jade Company, heard that the company was planning to buy a dozen new dining tables, and suggested to the leaders that a batch of unsuitable wooden signs that the company had been hoarding in the corner could be used to remodel dining tables. This saved a portion of the purchase cost. Lu Hongbin, a typist at the Shanghai Food Company, used three waste wax papers, plus some alcohol and ether, to make a small bottle of "correction fluid" for typing, the cost of which was only half the price sold on the market.

In addition, many employees and private family members actively opened up sales channels for overstocked goods, reduced losses, and accelerated capital turnover. For example, Xu Yuqin, a private family member of the joint state-private Gongxin Timber Firm, saw a batch of imported high-end rotten timber piled up in the store. Thinking that if it continued to be overstocked, the rot and losses would increase, she came up with a way to mark the variety, specifications, discounts, and prices of the rotten timber at the top of the wood. When customers came to the store, she would ask the salesmen to introduce this batch of long-overstocked timber first, based on the principle of usability and not making customers suffer losses, and finally sold the defective timber worth 2,000 yuan.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 7th - Employees of the Liaoning Provincial Department Store system saved more than 13 million yuan in various expenses for the country in 1956 by improving business management.

Over the past year, employees have put forward a large number of rationalization proposals to improve business management, and have created and promoted many advanced experiences. In the third quarter of last year, employees of department stores in 18 cities and counties, including Shenyang, Luda, Anshan, Benxi, Fushun, and Andong, submitted more than 1,000 rationalization proposals, of which the implementation of proposals related to saving expenses saved the country more than 2 million yuan. After the Shenyang, Luda, and Jinzhou three department store wholesale stations began to fully implement the experience of "platform distribution" and "direct delivery from factories" from the first quarter of last year, they saved the country 370,000 yuan in freight and accelerated the circulation of goods. After research, Wang Yongzhao, a dispatcher at the Shenyang Department Store Wholesale Station, processed and remade 9,000 boxes of deteriorated yellow shoe polish into black shoe polish, which was in short supply on the market, which not only avoided the loss of state property but also met the needs of the people.

In order to save freight, many purchasing personnel changed the goods previously transported by land to water transportation and combined water-land transportation. In the second quarter of last year alone, the transportation of 16,000 tons of goods back to the province saved more than 87,000 yuan in freight.

    商店里也有许多节约门路
    上海商业从业人员想出许多节约办法
    辽宁百货公司系统去年节约大量费用
    本报讯　随着增产节约运动的开展，上海市国营和公私合营商店里出现了许多节约的故事。国营上海第一文具批发商店废料间的老年管理员王福顺，他看到店里许多空木箱拆碎后以每斤八分的售价当废料卖给木箱店的情形，他想如果不把木箱拆碎，直接售给生产的厂子，这样每斤就可卖一角五分。而工厂出这个价钱回收旧木箱，也要比到板箱店购买便宜得多。这条建议经行政上采纳后，在1956年11月份，就节约了一千二百元左右。上海珠宝玉器公司秘书科公务员钱广林，听到公司准备新购十几张饭桌后，就建议领导上把公司积压在角落里的一批不适用的木制招牌，用来改制饭桌。这样节约了一部分购买费用。上海市食品公司打字员陆鸿宾，利用三张废蜡纸，加上一部分酒精和乙醚试制成一小瓶打字用的“修正液”，它的成本只占市上出售价格的一半。
    此外，还有不少职工和私方家属，积极打开积压商品的销路，减少损失，加快资金的周转。如公私合营公信木行私方家属徐玉琴，见到店里积压着的一批进口的高档烂木材，心想如果再积压下去，腐烂损失越大，她便想个办法，把木材的品种、规格、折扣、售价一一标在腐木材的顶端，当客户上门时，便叫营业员根据可用和不使客户吃亏的原则，首先介绍这批积压已久的木材，终于把价值二千元的残次木材推销出去。
    新华社沈阳7日电　辽宁省百货公司系统职工，1956年在改善经营管理中，为国家节约各项费用一千三百多万元。
    一年来职工们提出了大量改善经营管理的合理化建议，创造和推广了许多先进经验。沈阳、旅大、鞍山、本溪、抚顺、安东等十八个市、县百货公司的职工，去年第三季度共提出合理化建议一千多件，其中有关节约费用的建议实行后就给国家节约了二百多万元。沈阳、旅大、锦州三个百货批发站从去年第一季度开始全面推行“站台分拨”和“就厂直拨”的经验后，给国家节省运费三十七万元，并且加速了商品的流转。沈阳百货批发站调拨员王永照经过研究，把变质的黄色皮鞋油九千盒加工改制成市场上很缺的黑色皮鞋油，不仅避免了国家财产的损失，而且满足了人民需要。
    许多采购人员为了节约运费，把过去由陆运的商品改为水运和水陆联运，仅去年第二季度运回省内的一万六千吨商品，就节省运费八万七千多元。
