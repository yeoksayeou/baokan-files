Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 3rd. Xinhua News Agency reporter Shi Yunzi reports: In the process of implementing cooperativization in agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, what guiding principles and policies should be adopted for the socialist transformation of animal husbandry, and how should these guiding principles and policies be implemented? This issue has attracted the deep attention of the CPC Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regional Committee. The autonomous region has more than 10 million head of livestock distributed in agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas. Whether the socialist transformation of animal husbandry in these areas develops healthily is of great significance to the agricultural and animal husbandry production of the autonomous region.

After recent investigations and research from various aspects, the CPC Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regional Committee found that Party organizations in many agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas in the autonomous region have many shortcomings and errors in implementing the guiding principles and policies for the socialist transformation of animal husbandry. When the agricultural cooperativization movement began to form a climax, the CPC Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regional Committee, based on the characteristic that animal husbandry itself is very fragile, clearly stipulated that whether it is a pastoral area or an agricultural area, or a semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral area within the autonomous region, it must earnestly implement the guiding principle of "gradually realizing the socialist transformation of animal husbandry on the basis of steadily developing animal husbandry production." Furthermore, in light of the actual conditions in agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, it stipulated in policy several methods for livestock entering the cooperative from low to high levels. However, because leading cadres in various places lacked sufficient understanding of the important significance of developing the animal husbandry economy, some people mistakenly believed that this guiding principle was only applicable to pastoral areas and not suitable for agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, and therefore neglected leadership over animal husbandry in their work, disregarding the economic characteristics of their regions. In handling the issue of livestock joining cooperatives, many local cadres one-sidedly emphasized or even forced the masses to value their livestock and transfer them to the cooperatives, and the valuations were generally too low, and the repayment period was too long. As a result, the enthusiasm of farmers and herdsmen to develop livestock was frustrated. The phenomenon of selling and slaughtering large numbers of livestock occurred continuously in several major agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, seriously hindering the completion of the autonomous region's livestock breeding plan last year, and affecting the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production and the income of members of all ethnic groups.

In the past two months, the CPC Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regional Committee, through holding various meetings and sending working groups to the countryside for inspection, has clarified the current situation of animal husbandry in agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, and grasped some of the pressing problems that need to be solved. On December 26, 1956, it issued the "Instructions on Correcting the Guiding Principles and Policies for the Socialist Transformation of Animal Husbandry in Agricultural and Semi-agricultural and Semi-pastoral Areas" to Party organizations at all levels in the autonomous region. This instruction emphatically pointed out the following:

One, agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas must also implement the guiding principle of "gradually realizing the socialist transformation of animal husbandry on the basis of steadily developing animal husbandry production." Animal husbandry is an important component of the national economy of the autonomous region. When implementing the transformation of animal husbandry, all localities should distinguish between draft animals and draught animals that belong to the agricultural part, and livestock and draught animals that belong to the pastoral part. In addition to transferring the draft animals and draught animals of the agricultural part to collective ownership along with land and agricultural implements in order to facilitate the development of agricultural production, agricultural cooperatives should, when considering the entry of livestock belonging to the pastoral part into the cooperatives, fully consider how to give full play to the enthusiasm of farmers and herdsmen in raising livestock. The pace of transformation should not exceed the level of awareness of the masses.

Two, in accordance with the above guiding principle, it should be announced to rural cadres and farmers and herdsmen that whether or not livestock in agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas should join the cooperatives is entirely up to the voluntary decision of the members of the cooperatives, and no one shall force them to join the cooperatives in any form. The state protects the private livestock of farmers and herdsmen and supports their development. Agricultural cooperatives must pay attention to the development of both collectively owned livestock and privately owned livestock, and must provide livestock-raising households with assistance in many ways. Self-employed livestock-raising households should also take the initiative to seek assistance from the cooperatives.

Three, the valuation of livestock transferred to cooperatives must absolutely adhere to the principle of voluntariness. The valuation should be higher than the average market price, and the repayment period should generally not exceed three years, and must be repaid upon expiration. For livestock that has already joined the cooperatives, if the members of the cooperatives are willing to continue to have the cooperatives operate them in a unified manner, they should still be operated by the cooperatives in a unified manner; if the members of the cooperatives request to return them for self-raising or request to change them to valuation and transfer to the cooperatives, or for the cooperatives to raise them on their behalf, they should be returned or the method should be changed. Dairy cows, dairy goats, riding horses, etc., that were valued and transferred to the cooperatives in the past should be returned to the members of the cooperatives.

Four, take various effective measures to vigorously improve the feeding and management of livestock in cooperatives and fully demonstrate the superiority of collective management.

Five, Party organizations at all levels should immediately check and discuss the situation of the implementation of the guiding principles and policies for the socialist transformation of animal husbandry in the past, and set out methods to deal with existing problems. Through this kind of inspection and discussion, all rural work cadres and the masses will comprehensively understand the Party and government's guiding principles and policies for the socialist transformation of animal husbandry. When checking the shortcomings and errors in past work, do not be harsh on grassroots cadres, and pay attention to protecting the enthusiasm of agricultural cooperative cadres and active members.

    中共内蒙古自治区委员会指示各级组织
    正确贯彻畜牧业社会主义改造政策
    新华社呼和浩特3日电　新华社记者石云子报道：在农业区和半农半牧区实行合作化的过程中，对于畜牧业的社会主义改造应该采取怎样的方针政策和怎样贯彻这些方针政策？这个问题已经引起中共内蒙古自治区委员会的深切注意。自治区有一千多万头牲畜分布在农业区和半农半牧区，这些地区畜牧业社会主义改造发展得健康与否，对自治区的农业和畜牧业生产有着重大意义。　　经过最近多方面的调查研究，中共内蒙古自治区委员会发现自治区内许多农业区和半农半牧区的党组织，在执行对畜牧业社会主义改造的方针政策方面存在着不少缺点和错误。当农业合作化运动开始形成高潮的时候，中共内蒙古自治区委员会就根据畜牧业本身具有很大脆弱性的特点，明确规定自治区内不论是牧业区或是农业区、半农半牧区，一律必须认真执行“在稳定地发展畜牧业生产的基础上，逐步实现畜牧业社会主义改造”的方针，并且针对农业区、半农半牧区的实际情况，在政策上规定了由低级到高级的几种牲畜入社办法。但是由于各地领导干部对发展畜牧业经济的重要意义认识不足，有些人错误地认为这一方针只适用于牧区，不适合农业区和半农半牧区，因而在工作中忽视本地区经济特点，放松了对畜牧业的领导。在处理牲畜入社问题上，许多地区干部片面强调甚至强迫群众把牲畜作价归社，而且作价普遍偏低，偿价期限过长。这样做的结果，挫折了农、牧民发展牲畜的积极性，几个主要农业区和半农半牧区不断发生大量出卖和宰杀牲畜的现象，严重地阻碍了自治区去年牲畜增殖计划的完成，影响到农、牧业生产的发展和各族社员的收益。
    最近两个月以来，中共内蒙古自治区委员会通过召开各种会议，派遣工作组下乡检查等方式，摸清了农业区和半农半牧区畜牧业现状，抓住目前迫切需要解决的一些问题，在1956年12月26日向自治区各级党组织发出了“关于端正农业区半农半牧区畜牧业社会主义改造的方针政策的指示”。这个指示强调地指出了以下几点：
    一、农业区、半农半牧区同样必须执行“在稳定地发展畜牧业生产的基础上，逐步实现畜牧业社会主义改造”的方针。畜牧业是自治区国民经济中的一个重要组成部分，各地在对畜牧业实行改造的时候，应当把属于农业部分的耕畜、役畜和属于牧业部分的牧畜和役畜加以区别。农业社除了把农业部分的耕畜、役畜随着土地、农具等转为集体所有以有利于发展农业生产以外，对牧业部分的牲畜的入社，应当从充分发挥农牧民饲养牲畜的积极性这方面去考虑，改造的步骤不能超过群众觉悟程度。
    二、根据上述方针，应当向农村干部和农民、牧民宣布：农业区和半农半牧区的牧畜入社与否，完全听取社员自愿，任何人不得以任何形式强迫入社。国家对农、牧民私有牧畜一律保护，并扶持其发展。农业社必须注意公有牲畜和私有牲畜两方面的发展，必须给予养畜户以多方面的帮助，自有养畜户也要主动争取社的帮助。
    三、牲畜作价归社必须绝对遵守自愿原则。作价应当高于平均市场价格，折价偿还期一般不得超过三年，到期必须偿还。已经入社的牧畜，社员愿意继续由社统一经营的，仍由社统一经营；社员要求退回自养或要求改为作价归社及由社代放的，应当退还或者改变办法。过去把奶牛、奶羊、乘马等作价归社的，应当退还给社员。
    四、采取各种有效措施，大力改善合作社的牲畜饲养和经营管理，充分显示集体经营的优越性。
    五、各级党组织应即检查和讨论过去执行对畜牧业社会主义改造方针政策的情况，定出办法，处理存在的问题。通过这种检查讨论，使所有农村工作干部和群众全面地理解党和政府对畜牧业社会主义改造的方针政策。在检查过去工作中的缺点和错误的时候，不可苛责基层干部，要注意保护农业社干部和社员积极分子的积极性。
