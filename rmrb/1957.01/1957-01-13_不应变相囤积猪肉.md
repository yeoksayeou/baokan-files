    One Should Not Disguisedly Hoard Pork
    In some counties and districts of Anhui Province, some government cadres not only fail to understand the current difficulty that the production of live pigs cannot keep up with the growth of consumption and consciously eat less meat, but also take advantage of their convenience in working in rural areas. When farmers slaughter New Year pigs, they buy pork from the masses or ask village cadres to buy pork from farmers on their behalf for curing and storing for later consumption. Some farmers, out of consideration for their feelings, have no choice but to sell some meat to them.
    I think that under the current situation of pork supply difficulties, government cadres are already able to eat more meat in the canteens and should not buy more meat for curing. The Spring Festival is approaching, and I hope that government cadres in various places will share weal and woe with the masses and no longer disguisedly hoard pork. Li Ping

    不应变相囤积猪肉
    安徽省有些县区的机关干部，不但不体谅目前生猪生产赶不上消费量增长的困难，自觉地少吃一些肉，为了自己能够吃到更多的肉，反而利用在农村工作的便利，在农民宰杀年猪的时候，向群众或者托乡村干部代为向农民购买猪肉腌起来，留着以后慢慢吃。有些农民碍于情面，只好卖一些肉给他们。
    我觉得在目前猪肉供应有困难的情况下，机关干部在食堂里已能吃到较多的肉，是不应该再买肉腌起来的。春节即将到来，希望各地机关干部与群众同甘共苦不要再变相地囤积猪肉。　立平
