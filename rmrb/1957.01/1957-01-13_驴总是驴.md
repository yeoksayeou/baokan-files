    Editor's Note: The two Mongolian proverbs "Crying in sorrow is not as good as clenching your fist" and "People easily stumble on sweet words, horses often lose their footing on soft ground," which were published in the December 29th edition of this page, were previously published in the December 23rd and 25th editions of this page. This phenomenon of publishing the same article twice was caused by our editorial negligence. We sincerely apologize to our readers and express our gratitude to the readers who wrote to point out this error.

    驴总是驴（英国谚语）事后的建议，等于收获后的雨。
        ＊伪善的朋友，比公开的敌人更坏。
        ＊感谢是美德中最微小的，忘恩负义是恶习中顶坏的。
        ＊生活的目的不是为了吃饭，吃饭的目的可是为了生活。
        ＊井干了才觉得水的可贵。
        ＊驴总是驴，用黄金装饰也无用。
        ＊破坏仅需一小时，建成可要一百年。
        ＊一个小漏洞，可使大军舰遭致复没。
    赵志强、王僧道选译编者附记：去年12月29日本版上发表的蒙古谚语中的“泣泪悲愁，不如握紧拳头”；和“人在甜言上易栽跟头，马在软地上常打前失。”二条，曾在12月23日和25日本版登过，这种一稿登两次的现象，是由于我们编辑工作的疏忽而造成的。我们特向读者致歉，并向来信指出这个错误的读者们表示感谢。
