Xinhua News Agency, January 17th, New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee continued its discussion on disarmament issues on the 16th.

	Romanian representative, Mr. Brucan, pointed out in his speech that the Soviet Union and the United States have put forward new proposals on the disarmament issue. He said that the Soviet proposal constitutes a useful basis for negotiations. As for the US proposal, the Romanian government will "carefully consider and appropriately study it."

	The Romanian representative said that in the complex disarmament issue, the first thing that should be resolved now is the issue of banning the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

	Yugoslav representative, Mr. Brilej, said that the recent international crisis has made the disarmament issue more urgent. He believes that the disarmament issue should not require "excessive plans," but that an agreement should be reached as soon as possible on practical and feasible actual steps for disarmament.

	Mr. Brilej advocated inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of disarmament issues. He said that the People's Republic of China can make a significant contribution to the disarmament issue, and without the participation of Chinese representatives, the discussion of the disarmament issue creates an increasing sense of unreality.

	Japanese representative, Mr. Renzo Sawada, said that as the first and only victim country to be bombed by atomic bombs, the government and people of Japan are probably more aware than any other country of the painful disasters that nuclear weapons may bring to mankind. They fervently hope that the world will unanimously and immediately prohibit the production and use of nuclear weapons.

	He also said that conventional weapons must also be reduced.

	Mr. Renzo Sawada said that he was encouraged by the disarmament proposal put forward by the Soviet Union in November of last year, which "seems to indicate another step towards possible consensus."

	Mr. Renzo Sawada finally said, "I think that I am now fulfilling my responsibility to the Japanese people by once again calling for an early cessation of nuclear weapons explosion tests." At the very least, the Political Committee should insist that all nuclear tests should be announced in advance through the United Nations.

	Argentine representative, Mr. Bioy, said that his country is prepared to support any disarmament measures that could lead to peace.

    联大政委会继续讨论裁军问题
    苏联裁军建议受到广泛重视
    日本代表呼吁尽早停止核子武器试验
    新华社17日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会16日继续讨论裁军问题。
    罗马尼亚代表布鲁坎发言指出，苏联和美国已经提出了关于裁军问题的新建议。他说，苏联的建议构成了谈判的有益基础。至于美国的建议，罗马尼亚政府将“加以仔细的考虑和适当的研究。”
    这位罗马尼亚代表说，在错综复杂的裁军问题中，现在应该首先来解决禁止原子武器和氢武器的试验的问题。
    南斯拉夫代表布里列伊说，最近的国际危机使裁军问题具有了更大的紧急感。他认为，对裁军问题不应要求“过高的计划”，而应该早日就实际可行的裁军实际步骤达成协议。
    布里列伊主张邀请中华人民共和国代表参加裁军问题的讨论。他说，中华人民共和国对裁军问题可以作出重大的贡献，没有中国代表参加，对裁军问题的讨论就造成了日益增长的不现实的感觉。
    日本代表泽田廉三说，作为受原子弹轰炸的第一个、也是唯一的一个受害国家的日本的政府和人民，大概比任何其他国家更实际地认识到核子武器可能给人类带来的痛苦灾难。他们热烈希望全世界会一致地立刻禁止核子武器的生产和使用。
    他还说，常规武器也同样必须加以削减。
    泽田廉三说，他因去年11月苏联提出的裁军建议而感到鼓舞，这个建议“似乎表明了走向可能的思想一致的又一步骤”。
    泽田廉三最后说，“我认为，我现在再次呼吁尽早地停止核子武器爆炸试验是尽我对日本人民所负的责任。”至少，政治委员会应当坚持，一切核子试验都应当事先通过联合国加以宣布。
    阿根廷代表比奥伊说，他的国家准备支持任何可以导致和平的裁军措施。
