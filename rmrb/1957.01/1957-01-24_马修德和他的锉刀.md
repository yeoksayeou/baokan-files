    Ma Xiude and His Files
    Xue Chao
    The production of Ma Xiude files in Luoyang has a history of many years. The characteristics of this file are: uniform filing, appropriate hardness, and long-lasting rust resistance. Although it is handmade, it is labor-saving, efficient, and has a long service life, so workers are happy to use it. Not long ago, Ma Xiude files participated in the Chinese Export Commodities Fair held in Guangzhou, and won praise from foreign merchants. The China National Import and Export Corporation also accepted the entrustment of customers from five countries and sent samples to them separately.
    During the Anti-Japanese War, due to the blockade by Japanese imperialism, the supply of files, which previously relied entirely on imports, was cut off. At this time, Ma Xiude boldly began to try to manufacture files. Producing a file requires ten processes and at least three types of machinery and equipment. He not only didn't have machines, but even the general ironworking tools were not complete. However, he collected some broken and incomplete tools, and with two apprentices, produced batches of domestic files, supplying the needs of the market at that time.
    After years of research, his operating skills have become very proficient. When he uses a cleaver to chop out the file teeth, he is like a seasoned chef cutting vegetables, only listening to the sound of the knife without looking, and the chopped file teeth are uniform and deep, just like those chopped by a machine. During quenching, he only needs to look at the color of the fire on the blade to determine whether it has been heated to the right degree, not too soft and not too hard. People only need to see such skillful techniques to naturally realize how much hard work has gone into it. It was also this arduous labor that helped him to make products comparable to imported goods under the conditions of no machines and even no testing instruments.
    However, in the years of reactionary rule, he suffered from the exploitation of exorbitant taxes and levies, especially after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, under the squeeze of foreign goods, Ma Xiude was often in a state of semi-shutdown. After liberation, the People's Government opened up broad prospects for his production. Last year, Ma Xiude joined the Iron Industry Cooperative and became the director of the file workshop, and production has developed by leaps and bounds. The government attaches great importance to this high-quality product, and has increased funding, added machines, and transferred excellent workers. By the end of last year, the number of workers had increased to 130, more than 20 times more than before liberation; the output had increased by more than 100 times, half of which were manufactured by machines. However, these files can only meet the needs of Henan Province. In 1957, it is planned to increase the machine equipment by two times. After all these equipments are put into production, the production process of files will be basically mechanized, and the output will increase by 70% compared with the present. These are things that Ma Xiude never dreamed of before.

    马修德和他的锉刀
    薛超
    洛阳市马修德锉刀的生产已经有多年的历史了。这种锉刀的特点是：锉后均匀，硬度适宜，经久不锈。虽然是手工制造，但使用起来省力气，出活快，寿命长，工人们都乐于使用。前不久，马修德锉刀参加了在广州举行的中国出口商品展览会，博得了外国商人的好评。中国进出口公司还接受了五个国家顾主的委托，把样品分别寄给了他们。
    抗战期间，由于日本帝国主义的封锁，以前完全仰给于国外进口的锉刀已断绝供应。这时候，马修德就大胆地开始试制锉刀。生产一把锉刀要经过十道工序，最起码需要三种机器设备。他不但没有机器，连一般铁工工具都不齐全。但是，他搜集了一些残破不全的工具，带着两个徒弟，制出了一批一批的国产锉刀，供应了当时市场的需要。
    经过穷年累月地钻研，他的操作技巧达到很熟练的程度。当他用剁刀剁出锉纹的时候，像一个老练的厨师切菜一样，只听刀响不用眼看，而剁出的锉纹又均匀、又深刻，简直和机器剁的一样。在淬火的时候，他只要看一看刀的火色，就能判定是否已烧到好处，不软不硬。人们只要看到这样熟练的技巧，就会自然而然地意识到这里面渗透了多么艰辛的劳动。也正是这种艰巨的劳动，帮助他在没有机器，甚至没有检验仪器的条件下，制成了可与进口货媲美的产品。
    然而，在反动统治年代里，他受尽了苛捐杂税的盘剥，尤其是在抗日战争胜利后外货的排挤下，马修德经常处于半歇业状态中。解放后，人民政府才给他的生产开拓了广阔的前途。去年，马修德参加了铁工业合作社，当了锉刀车间的车间主任，生产更有了飞跃的发展。政府对这种质地优良的产品非常重视，给增加了资金，添置了机器，调来了优秀的工人。到去年末，工人已增至一百三十名，比解放前增加了二十多倍；产量增加了一百多倍，其中有一半产品是用机器制造出来的。但是，这些锉刀仅可供河南一省的需要。1957年计划增加两倍的机器设备。这些设备全部投入生产后，锉刀的生产过程就基本上机械化了，产量将比现在提高70％。这些都是马修德从前梦想不到的事。
