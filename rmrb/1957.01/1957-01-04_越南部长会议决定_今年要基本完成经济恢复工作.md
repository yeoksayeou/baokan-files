Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 3rd - The Council of Ministers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has decided that the task of the national plan this year is to basically complete the economic recovery.

Hanoi newspapers today published a communiqué from a Council of Ministers meeting held in December last year. The Council of Ministers also stipulated specific measures to complete the above tasks: restoring and developing agriculture and light industry producing consumer goods; consolidating and developing the state-owned economic sector; vigorously leveraging all the capabilities of handicrafts, and utilizing all positive forces of private industry and commerce. On this basis, gradually improving people's lives, contributing to the consolidation of national defense, and preparing conditions for economic and cultural development, in order to further consolidate the North as a strong support for the struggle for national reunification.

The communiqué addressed the achievements of the Vietnamese government in economic and financial aspects over the past two years and pointed out that the nature of the Vietnamese economy has gradually changed, and socialist and semi-socialist economic forces have played a leading role in the national economy. At the same time, private economic sectors, which were squeezed out during the French rule, have also received appropriate assistance in the past two years and have developed to a certain extent.

The communiqué mentioned that the lives of the majority of the population, the farmers and mountain people, have been partially improved. Other strata of people still have difficulties, but they will gradually be improved.

The communiqué, while pointing out the shortcomings in financial and economic work in the past two years, stated that in practical work, the government's correct line and policies for economic recovery have not been thoroughly implemented, and the characteristics of Vietnam's economic, political, and social conditions have not been fully considered. The communiqué said that in addition to paying attention to the basic agricultural production—grain production—efforts have not been made to restore and develop other agricultural production, and state-owned and private light industry and handicrafts producing consumer goods have not received due attention.

The communiqué, in discussing the cultural development in the past two years, pointed out that the scale of cultural development in the North has far exceeded that during the period of imperialism and feudalism. In 1957, the cultural level of the people will be further improved, and a new culture will be established and developed on the basis of promoting the national cultural heritage and learning from the advanced culture of the world.

    越南部长会议决定
    今年要基本完成经济恢复工作
    新华社河内3日电　越南民主共和国部长会议已经决定，今年国家计划的任务是基本上完成经济的恢复。
    今天河内的报纸刊登了去年12月间召开的一次部长会议的公报。这次部长会议还规定完成上述任务的具体办法是：恢复和发展农业和生产消费品的轻工业；巩固和发展国营经济成分；大力发挥手工业的一切能力，并且利用私营工商业一切积极的力量。在这个基础上逐步改善人民的生活，对巩固国防作出贡献，为经济和文化的发展准备条件，以便进一步巩固北方，成为统一国家斗争的坚强后盾。
    公报谈到两年来越南政府经济财政方面的成就，并且指出，越南经济的性质已经逐渐在改变，社会主义和半社会主义的经济力量在国民经济中起了领导作用。同时在法国统治时期受到排挤的私营经济，这两年来也得到适当的帮助，并且在一定程度上有了发展。
    公报提到占人口大多数的农民和山区人民的生活得到部分改善。其他阶层人民还有困难，但是一定会逐渐得到改善。
    公报在指出过去两年财政经济工作中的缺点的时候说，在实际工作中，还没有贯彻政府的正确的恢复经济的路线和方针，还没有充分注意越南的经济、政治、社会情况的特点的问题。公报说，在注意了农业的基本的生产——粮食生产之外，没有努力恢复和发展其他农业生产，生产消费品的国营和私营轻工业以及手工业还没有得到适当的注意。
    公报谈到两年来的文化发展指出，北方文化发展的规模已经远远地超过了帝国主义和封建主义的统治时期。在1957年，将进一步提高人民的文化水平，并在发扬民族文化遗产和学习世界先进文化的基础上，建立和发展新的文化。
