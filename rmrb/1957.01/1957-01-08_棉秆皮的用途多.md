    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou. Zhejiang Province's handicraft industry departments recently succeeded in testing the use of 30% to 50% cotton stalk bark mixed with jute to make ropes. The quality of this rope is the same as that of hemp rope made entirely of jute, with very strong tensile strength, and can be used for bundling goods in long-distance transportation. The handicraft industry department of Cixi County, a major cotton-producing area, has already started processing more than 300,000 jin of mixed rope. The provincial handicraft industry department plans to widely manufacture this mixed rope throughout the province.
    The trial production of slippers made from cotton stalk bark has also been successful. These slippers are durable and warm, and better than grass slippers. The provincial handicraft industry department is now also experimenting with using cotton stalk bark to make carpets and soundproofing boards.

    棉秆皮的用途多
    新华社杭州电　浙江省手工业部门最近试验用30％到50％的棉秆皮，混合黄麻制绳成功。这种绳的质量同全部用黄麻制成的麻绳一样，拉力很强，可以供长途运输中包扎货物用。棉花主要产地慈溪县手工业部门，已经开始加工三十多万斤混合绳。省手工业部门准备在全省广泛制造这种混合绳。
    用棉秆皮制拖鞋也已经试验成功。这种拖鞋耐穿保暖，比草拖鞋好用。省手工业部门现在还在试验用棉秆皮制地毯和隔音板等。
