Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 6th – General Wheeler’s headquarters, assisting Egypt in clearing the Suez Canal on behalf of the United Nations, issued a public announcement on the 4th stating that the UN salvage fleet had cleared the main obstacle in the Suez Canal, the eastern half of the Firdan Bridge.

The Firdan Bridge is located near El Qantara, between Port Said and Ismailia. This railway bridge to the Sinai Peninsula was destroyed by the British during the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt.

The head of the UN salvage fleet said that ships with a draft of twenty-four feet can now pass through the Firdan Bridge, although the western half of the bridge still needs to be cleared.

Wheeler's headquarters' announcement stated that the thirteen merchant ships that have been stranded in the canal since the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt will probably be able to begin passing through Port Said out of the canal on the 5th.

According to an announcement from Cairo on the 4th, five of the twenty-three sunken ships blocking Port Said have been salvaged.

According to newspaper reports, ships from Denmark, the Netherlands, Italy, West Germany, Sweden, and Belgium are currently participating in the cleanup work on the Suez Canal. There are also some British and French salvage ships flying the UN flag.

    苏伊士运河主要障碍已清除
    吃水二十四呎船只可通过费丹大桥
    新华社开罗6日电　联合国协助埃及清理苏伊士运河的惠勒将军总部4日发表公报宣布，联合国打捞船队4日已经清除掉苏伊士运河中的主要障碍、费丹桥东半部的桥身。
    费丹桥在塞得港和伊士美利亚之间的卡普附近。这座通往西奈半岛的铁路桥梁是在英法侵略埃及期间被英国炸毁的。
    联合国打捞船队的负责人说，吃水二十四英尺的船只现在已经可以通过费丹桥，虽然费丹桥西半部的桥身仍然必须加以清理。
    惠勒总部的公报说，从英法侵略埃及以来就被搁浅在运河中的十三艘商船大概可以在5日开始通过塞得港驶出运河。
    据开罗方面4日宣布，阻塞在塞得港的二十三艘沉船已经有五艘被打捞起来。
    据报纸报道，目前在苏伊士运河上参加清理工作的有丹麦、荷兰、意大利、西德、瑞典和比利时的船只。另外还有一些挂着联合国旗帜的英法打捞船。
