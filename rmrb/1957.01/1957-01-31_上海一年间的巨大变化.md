    Shanghai's Huge Changes in One Year
    By Our Correspondent Ji Yin
    January 20th is a day that the people of Shanghai will never forget. On this day last year, Shanghai, the most developed capitalist city in our country, took a decisive step towards socialism: over 84,000 capitalist enterprises in the city were approved to implement the advanced form of state capitalism – joint state-private ownership – all at once.
    A year has passed. What else has Shanghai done in this area during this year? What new developments and gains has it made?
    It is not easy to answer this question in detail. 1956 was the year in which Shanghai carried out the largest-scale work in joint state-private ownership and also achieved a decisive victory. The overall development has been smooth in the past year. The more than 80,000 newly jointly owned enterprises, after changing their relations of production, are rushing forward like unleashed steeds. The total output value of the more than 20,000 newly jointly operated factories increased by 37.5% compared to 1955. The net commercial sales of newly jointly operated commercial enterprises increased by 10.6% compared to 1955. Enterprises that were losing money every month before joint operation have become profitable every month. Units that were known for producing defective and substandard products before joint operation have also become factories producing excellent products. According to incomplete statistics, in the past year alone, some light industrial factories in Shanghai after the new joint operation have successfully trial-produced more than 1,300 new products. Shanghai's economic life has seen unprecedented prosperity, and the level of industrial production has exceeded the highest record in Shanghai's history. The lives of more than 600,000 employees in jointly operated enterprises have also generally improved. All this shows that the new system is infinitely superior to the old system.
    Around New Year's Day, I visited several factories, and the thriving new scene in these factories greatly moved me. The Shanghai No. 7 Steel Rolling Mill, a joint state-private enterprise, was only five small private steel rolling mills before joint operation. At that time, each factory had only a few acres of land, with dozens of workers crowded in a "steamer" at a temperature of one hundred and several tens of degrees all year round, and accidents such as broken legs and burned feet often occurred. The factory's output was low, and it lost money. The funds of three of the factories had already been reversed (the total funds were not enough to offset the debts), and the machines were affixed with bank mortgage labels. … These old traces are not easy to find today. Tall new factory buildings have been built on the old site, and the production site has been expanded nearly three times compared to the past. The changes in the steel rolling workshop are even greater, with automatic roller conveyors and various cooling equipment installed. Comrade Ma Xiangbai, the mechanic who took me on the tour, said, "In one year, the number of workers in the factory has more than doubled, the output has increased from 1,000 tons per month in the past to 3,000 tons, and the quality has also improved significantly."
    Someone told me an interesting thing: Shen Yuguang, the private deputy director of the Shanghai Joint State-Private Sheng Sheng Fine Arts Printing Factory, was very moved to see the factory's vigorous development after joint operation. One day, he found a large pile of documents with great emotion and said to the public director: "In the past, how could I not want to run the enterprise well? I thought of ways day and night, and made plans. These documents are various plans and systems that I personally drafted in the past on how to run the factory well. I don't know how much effort I put into it, but these plans just couldn't work!" After the factory was jointly operated, the production improved day by day. The workers took the initiative to go to brother factories to learn advanced experience, and printed exquisite export paintings on old machines. In the city's quality inspection of the printing industry in 1956, it was rated as an excellent unit. The output has also increased from 1,500 to 1,600 reams per month in the past to 2,000 reams. These achievements far exceeded the vague hopes he had put forward in his original plan.
    Who are the creators of these many miracles? The main credit should be attributed to the 600,000 employees of Shanghai's new joint state-private enterprises. Last year, they worked for the first time as masters of the enterprise and launched an unprecedented socialist competition. In just half a year, 2,000 advanced producers emerged and put forward more than 100,000 rationalization proposals. Last spring, more than 70% of the more than 10,000 cadres sent by the state were selected from among the workers. More than 2,200 employees have already served as public directors of factories, managers of district stores, and other positions.
    Capitalists and their agents in the new joint enterprises have also undergone profound changes in the past year. In the spring, they welcomed joint state-private ownership with firecrackers and gongs. Today, they have appeared as state staff in the manager's offices of specialized companies, factory director's offices, various responsible departments, and other work positions. In the past year, Shanghai has assigned 13,743 capitalist personnel to serve as managers, deputy managers, factory directors, and deputy factory directors. In the commercial sector, 71 capitalist personnel have become managers of specialized companies, and 453 have become managers of district stores. What they manage is no longer an enterprise, but dozens of factories and shops. Many capitalists and their agents have been assigned as consultants, commissioners, directors, and other positions.
    According to the Party's policy of redemption, Shanghai carried out the "four fixings" work for capitalists who applied for joint operation last year, namely fixing shares, fixing interest, fixing positions, and fixing salaries. In accordance with the principle of "leniency and settling as much as possible," the work of clearing, appraising, and financially processing the assets of enterprises was carried out, and dividends were distributed (the general annual interest rate was 5%, and the fixed interest rate for individual enterprises even exceeded 5%). The principle of "not moving high salaries and gradually adjusting low salaries" was implemented for the salaries of capitalists. Private personnel with shares of less than 2,000 yuan enjoy the same treatment as employees in terms of medical expenses for their own illnesses and wages during sick leave. Appropriate arrangements have also been made for their work after joint operation. More than half of the private personnel assigned as factory managers and factory directors hold full-time positions. Most of the private personnel in grassroots factories and stores have maintained their original positions.
    What particularly moved the private personnel was the state's care for households in difficulty. When Shanghai was carrying out the clearing of assets and fixing of shares, it was found that 3,833 private enterprises were in a predicament of asset reversal due to past capitalist operations, with a reversal of funds reaching more than 53 million yuan. In this socialist transformation, the state tried its best to save them, reducing or exempting the money they owed to the state, and handling the wages they owed to employees and other debts through consultation, so as not to bankrupt them, and to retain part of their private shares as much as possible. Only a very small number of enterprises with consistently bad business styles and dissatisfaction from the industry were treated as bankrupt. In this reorganization, more than 2,400 stores that were in serious difficulty due to blind development and other reasons in the past were removed, but work was assigned to all of the more than 8,000 employees in these stores. Some stores and personnel were also transferred to emerging industrial cities to work.
    This series of measures has been wholeheartedly supported by the capitalists. The facts have convinced them that socialist transformation has not stifled their lives, but has opened up a wider and brighter world for them.
    In the past year, with the change in the nature of enterprises, the relationship between capitalists and workers has also changed. Labor-capital disputes, which emerged endlessly in the private sector, have been greatly reduced, and even gradually disappeared. The Shanghai Municipal Labor Bureau accepted 926 labor-capital disputes in the fourth quarter of 1955, but in the first quarter after the joint operation of the entire industry last year, it was reduced to only 59 cases. Later, there were fewer and fewer; some district labor sections did not receive any dispute cases.
    The private personnel in Shanghai responded to the Party's policy of peaceful transformation with practical actions. Last year, more than 56,000 private personnel actively participated in the socialist labor competition of enterprises, more than 100,000 people participated in political study in an organized manner, and 8,153 private personnel were rated as advanced producers and advanced workers in the competition or received other rewards. Through these activities, they are gradually transforming themselves.
    In the past year, the huge development of production in Shanghai's new joint state-private enterprises has also been due to the correct production reorganization, which has initially brought the production of more than 80,000 new joint enterprises into the orbit of the national plan. The method of "segmental management and using points to lead the surface" was adopted for more than 20,000 factories, and more than 2,790 "central factories" were established according to the principle of "same products and taking care of nearby areas." The central factory uniformly leads a part of the "satellite factories," but production is decentralized, and profits and losses are calculated separately. In addition, Shanghai also has many factories with production characteristics, special technologies, small scale, and production of some special products; some factories are large in scale, well-organized, and have strong management capabilities. These factories have been identified as independent production units to maintain their characteristics. Shanghai has a total of 840 factories that have been designated as independent factories. By adopting these methods, all the large and scattered more than 20,000 new joint factories in Shanghai have been managed. In the commercial sector, 391 district stores have been established, and the district stores lead a part of the small stores in the same industry. In this way, Shanghai's huge commercial network is also managed.
    The leading organs of the central factories, independent factories, and district stores are specialized companies. Shanghai established a total of 140 specialized companies by industry last year. The specialized company represents the state in leading the new joint enterprises. This whole set of management methods is extremely important. Through these methods, the large number of scattered and complex new joint enterprises in the city can be organized, so as to carry out the transformation of enterprises in a guided and planned manner, and organize the production activities of enterprises.
    It is not enough to just manage it; it is also necessary to perform surgery on many ulcers brought from the old enterprises. Shanghai also carried out the work of "cutting, merging, and changing" in some industrial sectors last year: merging some factories that could be merged; carrying out mutual allocation of machinery and equipment between some factories; and relocating some surplus factories in a planned manner. After the reorganization of many factories, the appearance of the enterprises has been completely changed. The Xinhua Lun Woolen Mill was formed by the merger of four small woolen mills. In the past, the equipment of the four factories was incomplete. Some factories did not have dyeing and finishing equipment, and some could only weave cloth but could not spin yarn. After the merger, it became a full-fledged factory, and the qualified rate of products reached 99%, specializing in the production of excellent export woolen fabrics (products in the past could never be exported). In 1955, the factories lost a total of 250,000 yuan. After the joint operation last year, the enterprise had a surplus of 280,000 yuan. This is the first time that each factory has had a surplus in the years after liberation. Most of the factories that have undergone production reorganization have undergone this change. In the economic reorganization of Shanghai, there have also been some confusions. Some disrupted the original cooperative relationship; some were too hasty in the merger, and some that should not have been merged were also merged. These phenomena have now been basically corrected.
    It can be said that 1956 was the year with the most profound and significant changes in Shanghai in the past century. Now, 1956 has passed, but the great victory that the people of Shanghai have achieved in the transformation of capitalism in the past year will always be recorded on an important page of history and will inspire people to strive for the final elimination of the system of exploitation and the realization of the great ideal of socialism.

    上海一年间的巨大变化
    本报记者  季音
    1月20日，是上海人民永远难忘的一天。去年的这一天，我国资本主义最发达的城市——上海，向社会主义迈进了决定性的一步：全市八万四千多家资本主义企业，一次被批准实行了国家资本主义的高级形式——公私合营。
    一年过去了。在这一年里，上海在这方面又做了些什么呢？它有些什么新的发展和收获？
    详尽地回答这个问题不是容易的。1956年，是上海在公私合营方面进行了最大规模工作的一年，也是取得了决定性胜利的一年。一年来，总的发展是顺利的。改变了生产关系以后的八万多户新公私合营企业，就像出笼的骏马似地往前飞奔着。两万多家新合营工厂的总产值比1955年增长了37.5％。新公私合营的纯商业销售额，比1955年增长了10.6％。合营前月月亏本的企业，变得月月有盈余。合营以前出废品、次品闻名的单位，也变成了出产优良产品的工厂。据不完全统计，仅上海新合营后的部分轻工业工厂，去年一年中就试制成功了一千三百多种新产品。上海市的经济生活出现了空前的繁荣，工业生产水平超过了上海历史上的最高纪录。六十多万公私合营企业职工的生活也普遍地有所改善。一切都说明了，新制度无限地优越于旧制度。
    在元旦前后，我访问了几个工厂，这些厂欣欣向荣的一片新景象，使我受到很大的感动。公私合营上海第七钢厂，在合营以前，只是五家私营小轧钢厂。那时候，每个厂的厂房只有几分地那么大的一间，几十个工人，常年累月挤在一百几十度高温的“蒸笼”里工作着，经常发生轧断腿、烧伤脚的事故。工厂的产量低，亏本。其中三个厂的资金已经倒挂（全部资金还不足抵偿负债），机器上都贴上了银行抵押品的条子。……这些旧日的痕迹，今天已不容易找到了。在旧基地上已建起了高大的新厂房，生产场地已比过去扩大了近三倍。轧钢车间的变化更多，自动滚道机、各种降温设备都装上了。带我参观的机械师马相柏同志说：“一年里，厂里的工人已经增加一倍多，产量已由过去月产一千吨增长到三千吨，质量也显著提高了。”
    有人告诉我一件有趣的事情：上海公私合营生生美术印刷厂的私方副厂长沈毓光，看到工厂在合营后生产蓬勃发展，很受感动。有一天，他感慨万端地寻出了一大堆文件，对公方厂长说：“过去我何尝不想搞好企业呢？我日日夜夜想办法，订计划，这些文件就是我过去亲手拟订的各种如何办好工厂的计划和制度。我为它不知绞尽了多少心血，但这些计划怎么也行不通！”工厂在合营后，生产一天天的改观了，工人们主动跑到兄弟厂去学习先进经验，在旧的机器上印出了精美的出口画片。在1956年全市印刷业的质量大检查中，它被评为优胜单位。产量也由过去每月印一千五、六百令提高到二千令。这些成绩，都远远超过了他当初计划中所提出来的渺茫的希望。
    谁是这许多奇迹的创造者呢？主要的功迹应归于上海新公私合营企业的六十万职工。他们去年第一次以企业主人的姿态进行劳动，展开了规模空前的社会主义竞赛。仅仅在半年中，就出现了二千名先进生产者，提出了十万多件合理化建议。去年春天，在国家派出的一万多名干部中，就有70％以上是从工人中间选拔的。有二千二百多职工，已经担任了工厂的公方厂长、区店经理等职务。
    在新合营企业中的资本家及其代理人，在去年一年中也发生了深刻的变化。春天，他们以鞭炮和锣鼓迎接了公私合营。今天，他们已作为一个国家工作人员，出现在专业公司的经理室、厂长办公室、各个责任科室，以及其他工作岗位上。一年里，上海共有一万三千七百四十三个资方人员被分配担任了经理、副经理、厂长、副厂长的职务。在商业方面，有七十一个资方人员做了专业公司经理，有四百五十三人做了区店的经理。他们管理的已不是一个企业，而是几十个工厂和商店。许多资本家及其代理人被分配担任了顾问、专员、董事等职务。
    根据党的赎买政策，去年一年中，上海对申请合营的资本家进行了“四定”工作，即定股、定息、定职、定薪。按照“从宽处理、尽量了结”的方针，进行了企业的财产清理估价和财务处理工作，发放了股息（一般的年息五厘，个别企业定息还超过五厘）。对资本家的薪金实行了“高的不动，低的逐步调整”的原则。股金在二千元以下的私方人员，本人疾病医疗费和病假期间的工资支付，同职工享受同等的待遇。合营后对他们的工作也作了妥当的安排。安排为工厂经理和厂长的私方人员中，半数以上担任了正职。基层厂、店的私方人员大多数都维持原职。
    特别使私方人员感动的，是国家对困难户的照顾。上海在进行清产定股的时候，发现有三千八百三十三户私营企业由于过去的资本主义经营而陷于资产倒挂的窘境，倒挂资金达五千三百多万元。在这次社会主义改造中，国家尽力挽救了它们，减免了他们欠国家的款项，用协商的办法处理了他们欠职工的薪金和其他的债务，不使他们破产，并且尽可能给他们保留了一部分私股。只有极少数经营作风一贯恶劣、为同业所不满的企业，才作为破产处理。在这次改组中，撤除了二千四百多户因过去盲目发展等原因而陷于严重困难的商店，但给这些商店的全部从业人员八千多人分配了工作。也有一部分商店和人员，被输送到新兴工业城市去工作。
    这一系列措施，得到了资本家们的衷心拥护。事实使他们信服了，社会主义改造不是窒息了他们的生活，而是为他们开辟了更宽广光明的天地。
    一年来，随着企业性质的改变，资本家和工人的关系也起了变化。私营时期层出不穷的劳资纠纷大大减少，以至渐趋于消灭。上海市劳动局在1955年第四季度里曾经受理了劳资争议九百二十六件，到了去年全行业合营后的第一季度，就减少到只有五十九件。以后，愈来愈少了；有的区劳动科没有接到一起争议案件。
    上海的私方人员们，以实际行动回答了党的和平改造的政策。去年，有五万六千多私方人员积极地参加了企业的社会主义劳动竞赛，十多万人有组织地参加了政治学习，有八千一百五十三个私方人员在竞赛中被评为先进生产者和先进工作者，或得到其他奖励。他们通过这些活动，逐步地改造着自己。
    一年来，上海新公私合营企业生产上有了巨大发展，还由于正确地进行了生产改组，把八万多个新合营企业的生产初步纳入了国家计划的轨道。对二万多个工厂采取了“分片管理、以点带面”的方法，根据“产品相同、照顾相近地区”的原则，建立了二千七百九十多个“中心厂”。中心厂统一领导一部分“卫星厂”，但分散生产，各计盈亏。另外，上海还有许多具有生产特色、有特殊技术、规模小、生产一些特殊产品的工厂；有些厂规模较大、组织健全、管理能力较强。这些工厂就被确定为独立生产单位，以保持它们的特色。上海共有八百四十家工厂被作为独立厂。采用这些方式，就把上海数量庞大而分散的二万多新合营厂全部管起来了。在商业方面，建立了三百九十一个区店，区店领导一部分同行业的小商店。这样，把上海庞大的商业网也管起来了。
    中心厂、独立厂和区店的领导机关就是专业公司。上海在去年共按行业成立了一百四十个专业公司。专业公司代表国家领导新合营企业。这一整套的管理办法，是极其重要的。通过这些办法，便可以把全市大量分散复杂的新合营企业统统组织起来，从而能够有领导、有计划地进行企业的改造工作，组织了企业的生产活动。
    仅仅管起来还不够，还必须对许多从旧企业中带来的脓疮实行开刀治疗。上海去年又在一部分工业行业内进行了“裁并改合”工作：把可以合并的一些工厂合并起来；在有些工厂间进行了机器设备的互相调配；有计划地外迁一部分剩余工厂。许多工厂经过改组，企业面貌彻底改观了。新华伦毛纺厂，是由四个小毛纺厂合并而成的。过去四个厂的设备都残缺不全，有的没有染色、整理设备，有的只会织布，不会纺纱。合并以后就成了全能厂，产品的合格率达到99％，专门生产优良的出口毛织品（过去的产品从来不能出口）。1955年各厂共计亏蚀了二十五万元，去年合营后企业盈余了二十八万元。这是各厂在解放后几年来第一次有盈余。大部分经过生产改组的工厂都发生了这种变化。上海在经济改组中，也曾经发生过一些混乱，有的打乱了原有的协作关系；有的在合并时过于草率，把不该并的也并了。这些现象，现在基本上都已经纠正了。
    可以说，1956年是上海近百年来变化最深刻巨大的一年。现在，1956年已经过去了，但是上海人民这一年来在资本主义改造方面所取得的伟大胜利，则将永远记载在历史重要的一页上，并鼓舞人们为最后地消灭剥削制度、实现社会主义的伟大理想而努力。
