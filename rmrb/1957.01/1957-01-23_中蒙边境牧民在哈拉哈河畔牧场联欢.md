Xinhua News Agency, Hailar, 21st January: At 11:00 AM on January 16th, more than thirty herdsmen and cadres from the New Barag Left Banner of the Hulunbuir League in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, holding onto their horses, stood on a high hill in a pasture on the east bank of the Halaha River, within the territory of Choibalsan Province of the Mongolian People's Republic. Braving the biting cold wind, they gazed towards the snow-covered grasslands on the west bank of the Halaha River.

According to the method of mutually utilizing neighboring pastures to support livestock overwintering, agreed upon by the governments of China and the Mongolian People's Republic, recently more than one hundred and fifty herdsmen from the New Barag Left Banner drove more than 24,000 head of livestock across the border to this pasture. Now, these thirty-odd herdsmen and cadres, representing them, are welcoming the Mongolian herdsmen representatives and cadres to come as guests for a celebration.

Around 1:00 PM, more than twenty guests from the Mongolian side arrived on horseback, crossing the frozen Halaha River. Upon meeting, the hosts and guests joyfully hailed the friendship between the people of China and Mongolia. The Chinese herdsmen representatives repeatedly expressed their gratitude to the Mongolian government and people for agreeing to let them use their pastures for overwintering. Then, the hosts led the guests to their respective yurts, extending warm hospitality. Old woman Dawa was especially happy today, because a few days ago she heard that her sister Tan Zibu, from whom she had been separated for many years, had inquired about her to the Chinese representatives who had come to survey the pasture in advance, hoping to meet her. Today, her brother-in-law and nephew, whom she had never met before, came. Old woman Dawa gazed at them for a long time, not knowing what to say. When she and her sister parted, they were both very young and unmarried, but now they both had children and grandchildren. Elderly herdsman Mendsaikhan didn't return home until very late today. He grew up on the banks of the Halaha River, and today he reunited with his childhood companions from whom he had been separated for more than thirty years. He went from yurt to yurt, busy raising glasses and reminiscing with his childhood friends, talking about what had happened since their separation. At noon on the 17th, the guests and hosts embraced goodbye, and the hosts rode horses to see them off.

According to Xinhua News Agency: According to the method agreed upon by the Chinese and Mongolian governments to reasonably utilize neighboring pastures within their respective territories to support livestock overwintering, representatives from the Hulunbuir League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and representatives from the neighboring Choibalsan Province of the Mongolian People's Republic, after talks, recently reached an agreement in Hailar: Choibalsan Province of Mongolia agreed that the Hulunbuir League of China could move 350,000 head of livestock into pastures within Choibalsan Province to overwinter and overspring.

Choibalsan Province of Mongolia decided to allocate four sections of pasture for the Chinese herdsmen to graze their livestock. These four sections of pasture are 335 kilometers long and 5 kilometers to 35 kilometers wide. The usage period is from January to the end of April. During this period, the relocated herdsmen can use the land, reeds, willow branches, and other materials within the pasture. The Chinese side will take care of material supplies, medical care for people and livestock, and cultural life, and the Mongolian side is prepared to provide fraternal assistance.

Prior to this, hundreds of thousands of head of livestock from the Mongolian People's Republic had already moved into the Xilingol Grassland of Inner Mongolia for the winter.

    中蒙边境牧民在哈拉哈河畔牧场联欢
    新华社海拉尔21日电　1月16日十一时，内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔盟新巴尔虎左旗的三十多个牧民和干部扶着马，站在蒙古人民共和国乔巴山省境内哈拉哈河东岸牧场的一个高岗上，冒着刺骨的寒风，向哈拉哈河西岸的雪茫茫的草原了望。
    根据中国和蒙古人民共和国两国政府商定的互相利用邻近牧场支援牲畜过冬的办法，最近新巴尔虎左旗有一百五十多个牧民，赶着两万四千多头牲畜越过国境，来到这片牧场。现在，这三十多个牧民和干部代表他们，正在迎接蒙古方面的牧民代表和干部前来作客联欢。
    下午一点钟左右，蒙古方面的二十多位客人骑着马，踏过冰封的哈拉哈河来到了。主客见了面，尽情地欢呼中蒙两国人民的友谊。我方牧民代表对蒙古政府和人民同意利用他们的牧场过冬，一再表示感谢。然后，主人们便把客人们分别领到自己的蒙古包里，给予热情的招待。老太太达娃今天特别高兴，因为前几天她就听说和她分别多年的妹妹潭子布，曾经向我方事先来这一带勘察牧场的代表打听她，想和她见面。今天她的从未见过面的妹夫和外甥来了。达娃老太太久久地望着他们，不知道该说什么好。她和她妹妹分别时都还很年轻，没有出嫁，现在她们都已经儿孙满堂。老年牧民门德赛汗，今天很晚才回家。他是在哈拉哈河畔长大的，今天他和他分别了三十多年的童年时代的伙伴们又相逢了。他从这个蒙古包跑到那个蒙古包，忙着和童年时代的朋友们举杯言欢，畅述别后情景。17日中午，客人们和主人们拥抱告别，主人们骑马相送。
    据新华社讯　根据中蒙两国政府商定相互合理地利用双方境内邻近的草场支援牲畜过冬的办法，内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔盟代表和邻近的蒙古人民共和国乔巴山省代表经过会谈后，最近在海拉尔达成协议：蒙古乔巴山省同意中国呼伦贝尔盟将三十五万头牲畜迁入乔巴山省境内牧场过冬过春。
    蒙古乔巴山省决定划出四段牧场供我方迁入牧民放牧牲畜使用。这四段牧场全长三百三十五公里，宽五公里到三十五公里。使用期间是1月到4月底。在这个期间，迁入的牧民可以使用牧场内的土地、苇子、柳条等各种资料。物资供应、人畜医疗、文化生活，由我方自行解决，蒙古方面准备给予兄弟般的援助。
    在此以前，蒙古人民共和国的十几万头牲畜已经迁入内蒙古锡林郭勒草原过冬。
