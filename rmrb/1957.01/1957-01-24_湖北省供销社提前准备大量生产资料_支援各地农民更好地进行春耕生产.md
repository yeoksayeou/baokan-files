Hubei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Prepares a Large Quantity of Production Materials in Advance
    Support Farmers in Various Regions to Better Carry Out Spring Plowing Production

    (Our Newspaper News) In order to support farmers in better carrying out spring plowing production, the Hubei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has prepared and transported production materials in advance. Since the fourth quarter of last year, supply and marketing cooperatives in this province have successively transported more than 21,730 tons of chemical fertilizers and more than 6,000 tons of pesticides to various grassroots supply stations. More than 39,000 pieces of agricultural machinery are also being shipped.

    This year, the distribution and preparation of large quantities of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural machinery are being carried out based on the principle of "priority use in cotton and grain production areas and other economic crop areas" and to ensure that "where there are insect pests, there are pesticides and machinery." At the same time, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also secured more than 2,000 tons of pesticides, which are stored separately in key transportation hubs such as Shashi, Huangshi, and Xiangfan, for unified allocation and use.

    After the distribution of fertilizers, pesticides and machinery, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the supply and marketing cooperatives of various counties have organized working groups to go to various places to check storage and other conditions. The Jingzhou Special District Cooperative Office also held a meeting on January 5 to promote the early preparation of the supply of production materials in various places. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also opened a training class for more than 80 people to train teachers for technical training in various county cooperatives. At the same time, it is required that all county cooperatives complete the training of technical personnel before spring plowing, so as to provide technical guidance to farmers.

    In order to compensate for the shortage of chemical fertilizers, the province's supply and marketing cooperatives will organize 1.5 million tons of miscellaneous fertilizers for farmers, which have now been distributed by the Provincial Cooperative to the county supply and marketing cooperatives for specific implementation.

    湖北省供销社提前准备大量生产资料
    支援各地农民更好地进行春耕生产
    本报讯　湖北省供销合作社提前准备和调运生产资料，支援农民更好地进行春耕生产。从去年第四季度起，这个省的供销社就把二万一千七百三十多吨化学肥料和六千多吨农药陆续调运到各基层供应站。三万九千多架农业机械也正在起运。
    今年，大量的化学肥料和农药及农业机械的分配与准备，是根据“首先使用到棉、粮产区及其它经济作物区”的原则和为了保证“哪里有虫害，哪里有药械”而进行的。同时，省供销社还掌握了二千多吨农药，分别储存在沙市、黄石市、襄樊市等交通要道，以便统一调拨使用。
    肥料和药械下拨后，省供销社和各县供销社已多次组织了工作组，深入到各地检查储存等情况。荆州专区合作办事处并于1月5日召开会议，推动各地及早作好生产资料的供应工作。省供销社还开办了一个八十多人的训练班，为各县社培养技术训练的师资人员。同时，要求各县社在春耕前一律把技术人员训练完毕，以便对农民进行技术指导。
    为了弥补化学肥料的不足，全省供销社将为农民组织杂肥一百五十万吨，现已由省社分配到各县供销社具体执行。（王本真）
