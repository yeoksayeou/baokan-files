    Is the Speed of Agricultural Increase in Our Country Fast or Slow?
    Hua Shu
    Recently, good news has been pouring in from various industrial production sectors, with constant reports of production volumes increasing dozens of times over in just a few years. In agricultural production, although last year saw an increase of over 20 billion jin of grain and significant amounts of cotton, flue-cured tobacco, and other technical crops despite severe disasters, the speed of increase seems to pale in comparison to industry. Therefore, some people believe that the growth rate of agricultural production in our country is too slow.
    How should we view this issue?
    From the perspective of the overall national economic development, the speed of agricultural increase in our country should and can continue to be improved. We must never think that the speed of the past few years is already satisfactory. In fact, the Party and the government have never relaxed their efforts in this regard. However, we must also recognize that before the realization of national industrialization, there are bound to be certain limitations on the improvement of the speed of increase.
    The production conditions for industry and agriculture are different; the historical situations of industry and agriculture in our country are even more inconsistent. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately measure the speed of agricultural development using the standards of industrial development; it is like a steel factory cannot compete with an agricultural production cooperative. To measure the speed of agricultural increase in our country, we cannot directly compare it with the speed of industrial increase. However, we can try to compare it with other countries.
    The reason it is called a "try" is because the formation of a country's agricultural increase speed is extremely complex. It is not only inseparable from natural conditions, crop types, farming conditions, and agricultural history, but also closely related to the economic system. For example, some people believe that the yield per unit area of rice in our country is too low and the increase is too slow, ranking seventh, eighth, or even eleventh in the world. However, we know that the rice cultivation area in our country accounts for more than 10% of the total cultivated area, while those ranked at the top, such as Spain, only account for about 0.1%, and Italy only accounts for about 0.13%. If we compare the absolute numbers of land, the difference will be even greater, so this comparison method may not be appropriate. At the same time, although the issue of agricultural increase speed has aroused the interest of many people ever since the British vulgar economist Malthus put forward the so-called "population theory" more than a hundred years ago regarding whether food increases arithmetically, there is a lack of systematic materials in this regard, and the methods of investigation and statistics are extremely inconsistent. For example, the yield per unit area is calculated based on the sown area in some cases and based on the harvested area in others. Due to the above-mentioned limitations, it is very difficult to make accurate comparisons. The following data from various countries in the capitalist world are only provided for reference.
    Let's look at the statistics published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (F.A.O.): Among the capitalist countries, only Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and Turkey exceeded the pre-war level (based on 1934-1938 or 1935-1939) by more than 50% in the 1952-53 fiscal year. As for the United States, it only exceeded 38%; the percentages by which some other countries exceeded the pre-war level are: Italy 18%, Spain 4%, Egypt 19%, India 1%, Pakistan 3%, Japan 10%. Burma was still 11% below the pre-war level.
    The total output value of agriculture and its subsidiary industries in our country had already increased by 48.5% in 1952 compared to the level at the time of liberation in 1949. At that time, grain production had increased by 44.8%, and cotton production had increased by 193%. By 1955, the total output value of agriculture and its subsidiary industries had increased by more than 70% compared to 1949 (calculated at constant 1952 prices, from 32,595 million yuan to 55,544 million yuan).
    Let's compare various major crops. Let's first look at the situation before World War II. According to a statistical report published by the American Food Research Institute in 1933, taking wheat, the world's main food crop, as an example. In the fifty years from 1885 to 1934, the world's total wheat production increased from 2,260.3 million bushels to 4,816.3 million bushels. The average annual increase was 51.12 million bushels, with an annual increase rate of 2.1%. As for the yield per unit area, the average annual increase rate per acre was only 0.2% in these fifty years. Analyzing by country, Italy had the fastest increase in unit area yield in those fifty years, increasing by 1.8% per year. That is to say, at this fastest rate, the unit yield could not double in half a century.
    Let's look at the situation after World War II. Let's try to analyze the three major crops of wheat, rice, and cotton. The sources of the materials are all based on the survey reports of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
    1. Wheat
    The world's average annual wheat production before the war (1934-1938) was 128.8 million tons, which increased to 165.2 million tons in 1952, an increase of less than 30% in fifteen years. By country, Canada had the fastest increase, reaching 125%, and the United States reached 60%.
    2. Rice
    The world's average annual rice production before the war (1934-1938) was 151.2 million tons, which increased to 159.3 million tons in 1952. An increase of 0.5% in fifteen years. By country, the United States had a faster increase, reaching 47%, the Philippines reached 30%, and Pakistan reached 10%. The United States was able to increase so much mainly because the United States had little rice production before the war, with an average annual production of only 956,000 tons. Only after 1950 did it exceed 2 million tons. As for other major rice producing countries, such as Japan, it only increased by 0.8%, India only 0.3%, and Burma even decreased by 16%.
    3. Cotton
    The world's total cotton production before the war (1934-1938) was 5.85 million tons, which increased to 7.04 million tons in 1952. An increase of 20% in fifteen years. By country, Mexico had the fastest increase, reaching 250%, mainly because its annual production before the war was very small, less than 70,000 tons. As for the United States, it only increased by 5%; Egypt increased by 11%; India and Pakistan also decreased by 5%.
    Based on the above figures, let's compare the speed of agricultural increase in our country:
    The total output of grain crops in our country averaged 138 million tons per year before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the highest annual output reached 150 million tons. During the War of Resistance, it fell to 114 million tons, and further dropped to 113 million tons in 1949, only 82% of the pre-war level. However, by 1952, it quickly rose to 163.9 million tons, an increase of more than 18% over the pre-war level, and an increase of more than 44.8% over the 1949 level. According to the indicators of the Five-Year Plan, the total grain output will reach 181.59 million tons by 1957, which is more than 31% higher than the pre-war level. (Note: The above figures include soybeans. If soybeans are excluded, then the estimated total grain output in 1956 has already exceeded the increase target for 1957.)
    Specifically, among the total output of grain crops in our country, rice accounts for the largest proportion, often more than 42%. The highest annual output before the war (1936) was 57,341,000 tons, which fell to 48,645,000 tons in 1949. But by 1955, it had risen to 78,024,000 tons, that is to say, it increased by more than 36% in twenty years. Last year, due to the success of resisting disasters and reforming technology, the estimated output is about 84 million tons.
    Wheat accounts for a smaller proportion of the total grain output in our country, often around 13%. The highest annual output before the war (1936) was 23,295,000 tons, which fell to 13.8 million tons in 1949. In 1954, it once rose to 23.33 million tons, exceeding the highest pre-war level, but in 1955, it fell back to 22,965,000 tons. Last year, the country had a bumper wheat harvest, and the estimated output is about 25 million tons, which can exceed the highest pre-war level by more than 7%.
    The total cotton production in our country averaged 540,000 tons per year before the war (1933-1937), and the highest annual production (1936) reached 850,000 tons. In 1949, it fell to 445,000 tons, almost halving the highest annual output; but by 1952, it quickly rose to 1.3 million tons, that is to say, it almost doubled in three years. It also increased by 54% compared to the highest pre-war level. Last year, although the main cotton producing areas in our country, such as Hebei Province, suffered severe disasters, the estimated output can still reach about 1.54 million tons, which can reach 180% of the highest pre-war level.
    In general, the speed of agricultural increase in our country has basically exceeded the level of various countries in the capitalist world. How can it be said that it is too slow? (To be continued)

    我国农业增产的速度是快还是慢
    华恕
    最近，各个工业生产部门捷报频传，不断地有几年内生产量增长了几十倍的好消息。而农业生产方面，虽说去年在严重的灾情之下还是比1955年增产了二百多亿斤粮食和许多棉花、烤烟等技术作物，但是在增产的速度上，比起工业来，似乎还是大有逊色。因此有人认为我国农业生产的增长速度实在太慢了。
    应该怎样来看待这个问题呢？
    从整个国民经济发展的观点来看，我国农业增产的速度，是完全应该和可能继续提高的。我们决不应该认为过去几年的速度已经可以令人十分满意了。事实上，党和政府也从来没有放松过在这方面的努力。可是，我们又不能不看到，在国家工业化尚未实现之前，增产速度的提高还必然地存在着一定的局限性。
    工业和农业的生产条件不同；我国工业和农业的历史情况更不一致。因此，拿工业发展的尺度去衡量农业发展的快或慢，是难以确切的；这好比一个钢铁工厂不可能同一个农业生产合作社展开竞赛一样。要衡量我国农业增产的速度，不能同工业增产的速度直接去比。但是，不妨同其他国家试作比较。
    其所以说是“试”，是因为一个国家的农业增产速度的形成，内容极其复杂。这不但同自然状况、作物种类、耕作条件、农业历史情况分不开，而且同经济制度也有着密切的关系。例如，有人认为我国水稻的单位面积产量太低，提高得也太慢，比起世界各国来，要排到第七、八位甚至第十一位。可是，我们知道，我国的稻作面积要占总耕地面积10％以上，而名列前茅的，如西班牙仅占0.1％左右，意大利仅占0.13％左右。如果再以土地的绝对数字去比较，那就相差更大，因此这种比法，也未必妥当。同时，虽然关于农业增产的速度问题，远在一百多年前，由英国庸俗经济学家马尔萨斯提出所谓“人口论”之后，对于食粮之是否按算术级数增加的问题，就已引起许多人的兴趣。但这方面的系统材料既感缺乏，调查统计的方法也极不一致。如单位面积的产量，有的按播种面积计算，有的则按收获面积计算。由于以上种种条件的限制，要确切地进行比较是很困难的。以下我们所列举的一些资本主义世界各国的资料，也仅仅是提供参考而已。
    且看联合国粮农组织（F．A．O）所发表的统计：资本主义世界各国，到1952—53年度，全部农产物超过战前（以1934—1938或1935—1939为基期）水平50％以上的，只有加拿大、墨西哥、哥伦比亚和土耳其这么几个国家。至于美国，只超过38％；别的一些国家超过战前水平的百分数是：意大利18％，西班牙4％，埃及19％，印度1％，巴基斯坦3％，日本10％。缅甸还低于战前水平11％。
    我国农业及其副业的总产值，到1952年，即已较1949年解放时的水平增长了48.5％。那时的粮食产量已增长了44.8％棉花产量已增长了193％。到1955年，农业及其副业的总产值已经比1949年增长了70％以上（按1952年不变价格计算，由三百二十五万九千五百万元增加到五百五十五万四千四百万元）。
    再拿各种主要作物来比较。我们先来看看第二次世界大战以前的情况。据美国粮食研究所在1933年发表的统计报告，以世界主要的粮食作物小麦为例。从1885年到1934年的五十年中，世界小麦总产量，由二十二万六千零三十万英斛，增加到四十八万一千六百三十万英斛。平均每年增加五千一百十二万英斛，年增产率为2.1％，至于单位面积的产量，在这五十年中平均每英亩的年增产率仅0.2％。再以国别来分析，也还是在那五十年中，单位面积增加得最快的是意大利，每年增加1.8％。也就是说，按照这个最快的速度，单位产量半个世纪还不能增加一倍。
    再看第二次世界大战以后的情况。我们试从小麦、稻谷、棉花三种主要农作物来分析。材料来源，都是根据联合国粮农组织的调查报告。
    一、小麦
    战前（1934—1938）世界各国小麦年平均产量为一万二千八百八十万吨，到1952年增加到一万六千五百二十万吨，十五年内共增加了不到30％。按国别来说，其中增加得最快的是加拿大，达125％，美国达60％。
    二、稻谷
    战前（1934—1938）世界各国稻谷年平均产量为一万五千一百二十万吨，到1952年增加到一万五千九百三十万吨。十五年内共增加了0.5％。按国别来说，增加得较快的是美国，达47％，菲律宾达30％，巴基斯坦达10％。美国能增加得那么多，主要原因是战前美国稻谷的产量不多，年平均仅九十五点六万吨，到1950年以后，才超过二百万吨。至于其他稻谷的主要出产国，如日本，仅增长了0.8％，印度仅0.3％，缅甸还降低了16％。
    三、棉花
    战前（1934—1938）世界各国棉花总产量为五百八十五万吨，到1952年增加到七百零四万吨，十五年内共增加了20％，以国别来说，增加得最快的是墨西哥，达250％，这主要是因为它战前年产量很少，还不到七万吨。至于美国只增加了5％；埃及增加了11％；印度和巴基斯坦，还降低了5％。
    根据以上的数字来对比一下我国农业增产的速度：
    我国粮食作物的总产量，抗日战争以前的年平均产量为一万三千八百万吨，最高年产量曾达一万五千万吨。抗战期间，降落到一万一千四百万吨，到1949年更降至一万一千三百万吨，只及战前水平82％。可是到1952年，就迅速地上升到一万六千三百九十万吨，较战前水平增长了18％以上，较1949年水平增长了44.8％以上。按照五年计划的指标，到1957年粮食总产量将达到一万八千一百五十九万吨，即较战前水平提高31％以上。（按：上引数字，包括大豆在内。如果除去大豆，那么1956年的预计粮食总产量，即已超额完成1957年的增产指标。）
    具体地说，我国粮食作物总产量中，以稻谷所占的比重最大，经常在42％以上，战前最高年（1936）产量为五千七百三十四万一千吨，1949年曾降至四千八百六十四万五千吨。但到1955年已上升到七千八百零二万四千吨，也就是说，二十年内增长了36％以上。去年由于抵抗灾害和改革技术的成功，预计产量八千四百万吨左右。
    小麦在我国粮食总产量中所占的比重较小，经常在13％左右。战前最高年（1936）产量为二千三百二十九万五千吨，1949年降至一千三百八十万吨，1954年曾一度上升到二千三百三十三万吨，超过战前最高年水平，但1955年又回落到二千二百九十六万五千吨。去年全国小麦普遍丰收，预计产量二千五百万吨左右，可超过战前最高年水平7％以上。
    我国棉花的总产量，战前（1933—1937）平均年产量为五十四万吨，最高年（1936）产量曾达八十五万吨。1949年降至四十四万五千吨，较最高年产量几乎跌落了一半；可是到1952年，就迅速地上升到一百三十万吨，也就是说，三年之内，几乎增长了两倍。较战前最高年水平也增长了54％。去年，虽然我国的主要棉区如河北省等，遭受了严重的灾害，但预计产量仍可达到一百五十四万吨左右，可达到战前最高年水平180％。
    总的看来，我国农业增产的速度，已经基本上超过了资本主义世界各国的水平。怎么能够说是太慢了呢？　（未完）
