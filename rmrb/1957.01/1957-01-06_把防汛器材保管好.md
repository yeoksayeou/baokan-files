    Take Good Care of Flood Control Materials
    Every year, many places across the country allocate a lot of money from their water conservancy funds to purchase flood control materials to combat typhoons and floods. However, once the typhoon season and flood season are over, these flood control materials are often abandoned and neglected. As a result, theft and embezzlement of flood control materials frequently occur, and some materials even rot due to poor storage. Last year, the masses in Changlou and Guanshao townships in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, took 28 flood control wooden stakes without permission to repair boats, bridges, and lay channels. Cadres of the Huaxi Agricultural Cooperative in Huaying Township took 24 flood control wooden stakes to build a shed for vehicles. They not only did not realize that it was wrong to take state flood control materials casually, but also thought: "The wooden stakes belong to the public, and the agricultural production cooperative is also the public."
    Losses every year, purchases every year, not only waste state wealth, but sometimes also affect major flood control and disaster relief efforts because the supply of materials is not timely. Moreover, some of the timber and bamboo are still commodities in short supply, and should be cherished all the more. I suggest that water conservancy departments in various places pay attention to this issue and take good care of flood control materials. For a large number of materials, the method of retrieval should be adopted, transporting them back from flood control areas for centralized storage; for materials that are more dispersed and difficult to transport back, nearby agricultural cooperatives can be entrusted to store them on behalf of the government, and education on cherishing state wealth should be conducted among the broad masses to prevent embezzlement. At the same time, some reward and punishment measures can also be stipulated, rewarding and commending agricultural cooperatives or members who conscientiously take care of state flood control materials, and giving criticism, education, or certain legal sanctions to those who damage state property.

### 把防汛器材保管好

    把防汛器材保管好
    全国许多地方每年都从水利经费中抽出很多钱来，添置防汛器材，抗击台风大汛。但是，等到台风季节和汛期一过，大都对这些防汛器材抛弃不管。因此，防汛器材被盗卖、挪用的现象经常发生，有一部分器材还因为保管不善而霉烂了。江苏省松江县长漊、官绍两个乡的群众，去年就擅自拿去二十八根防汛的木桩去修船、修桥和敷设渠道。华营乡华西农业社的干部拿去二十四根防汛木桩造车棚，他们不但没有认识到随便取用国家防汛器材是不对的，反而认为：“木桩是公家的，农业生产合作社也是公家。”
    年年损失，年年添置，不仅浪费国家财富，而且有时候还会因为器材供应不及时而影响防汛抗灾的大事情。而且，其中有些木材竹材，目前还是供不应求的商品，更应该万分珍惜。我建议，各地水利部门都来重视这个问题，保管好防汛器材。对于数量较多的器材，应该采取收回的办法，从防汛地带运回，集中保管；比较分散而不易运回的，可以委托附近农业社代为保管，并且向广大群众进行爱护国家财富的教育，防止挪用现象。同时，还可以规定一些奖惩的办法，对认真保管国家防汛器材的农业社或社员进行奖励表扬，对破坏国家财产的给以批评教育或一定的法律处分。
