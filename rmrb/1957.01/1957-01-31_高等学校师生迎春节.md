College and university teachers and students welcome the Spring Festival

    More than 4,000 students staying at the Renmin University of China are carrying out various meaningful activities to welcome the Spring Festival.

    On the eve of the Spring Festival, the free markets in Beijing appeared particularly lively. More than 30 students from the economics-related majors of the Renmin University of China formed a free market survey group, conducting surveys in the free markets of Xidan and Xuanwu districts starting from January 27th. The purpose of this survey is primarily to cooperate with student scientific research, strengthen understanding of practical knowledge, expand the knowledge field, and cultivate students' independent thinking and interest in scientific research. Teachers are participating in this survey to provide guidance.

    Last night, the Renmin University of China held a grand social dance and arranged a comprehensive "Grand View Garden" evening party. Here, students can fully engage in rich and colorful recreational activities. They also held an ice party and arranged many interesting programs.

    On the Spring Festival day, some students will have a get-together with the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in the Dongsi District. On February 1st, more than 200 students will visit the Si Ji Qing Vegetable Production Cooperative on the outskirts of Beijing. This vegetable production cooperative has a deep friendship with the Renmin University of China. As early as 1954, students from the departments of trade and finance helped them establish a library. This year, in addition to visiting, students will also help them reorganize this library.
