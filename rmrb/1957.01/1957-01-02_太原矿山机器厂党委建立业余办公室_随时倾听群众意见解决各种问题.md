    The Party Committee of Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant Establishes an Amateur Office
    Listens to the Opinions of the Masses and Solves Various Problems at Any Time

    (Our Newspaper News) The Party Committee of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, in order to promptly discover and solve various problems among the workers, established an amateur office in the workers' dormitory area.

    In the past, although leading cadres constantly visited workers in the workshops, it was difficult to understand the situation when the workers were operating. When the workers got off work and wanted to talk to the leading cadres, the cadres were off work too. In order to change this situation, the Party Committee of the Mining Machinery Plant decided to set up an amateur office in the workers' dormitory area. From Monday to Friday, from 6:30 PM to 9:30 PM, during the workers' off-work rest time, responsible comrades from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League would take turns receiving visiting masses every day.

    The amateur office has been welcomed by the workers and has also prompted leading cadres to further delve into reality and promptly solve various problems raised by the workers. For example, in late August, the forging and riveting workshop received the task of completing 552 drill protection plates within five days. The original plan was to use 3 cm steel plates. In the case of material shortages and tight deadlines, the workshop director Zhang Jinfeng and several workers suggested replacing them with 1 cm steel plates. According to the test results, the chief engineer of the factory affirmed that this was possible, but the engineers of the design department disagreed. The workers reported this situation to the amateur office, and the leadership persuaded the engineers of the design department and actively supported their approach. As a result, not only was the task completed ahead of schedule and the quality guaranteed, but also 5,814 kilograms of steel were saved.

    The factory's leadership originally thought that most of the foreman and workshop directors in the factory were promoted from among the veteran workers, and they would naturally have the work style of contacting and relying on the masses. However, later, based on the situation reflected by the masses to the amateur office, the original estimate of the factory leadership was not entirely consistent with reality. Some newly promoted grassroots cadres often only knew that they wanted workers to complete tasks, but did not understand the great role and significance of the mass line, so there was often a phenomenon of coercion and command. After the leading cadres discovered these problems, they decided to train the newly promoted grassroots cadres in batches and provide them with education on the mass line. The amateur office of this factory started working in late June last year. By the end of November, it had received more than 130 visiting masses who raised 172 issues. Among them, except for 13 cases that have not been dealt with, the rest have been resolved one by one, and everything has a result.

    太原矿山机器厂党委建立业余办公室
    随时倾听群众意见解决各种问题
    本报讯　太原矿山机器厂党委会，为了及时发现和解决职工群众中的各种问题，在职工宿舍地区，设立了业余办公室。
    过去，虽然领导干部也不断到车间去访问工人，可是当工人正在进行操作时，了解情况是有困难的。等工人下了班想找领导干部谈谈，干部们又下班了。为了改变这种情况，矿山机器厂党委决定在职工宿舍地区设立业余办公室，每星期一到星期五下午六时半至九时半工人下班休息时间内，由党、行政、工会、青年团负责同志每天轮流接待来访群众。
    业余办公室受到了职工群众的欢迎，也促使领导干部进一步深入实际，及时解决职工群众所提出来的各种问题。如8月下旬，锻铆车间接到了限五天内完成钻探机防护板五百五十二件的任务，原计划用三糎的钢板做，在材料缺乏任务紧张的情况下，车间主任张金锋和几个工人建议用一糎的钢板代替，厂的总工程师根据试验结果，肯定这样做是可以的，可是设计科的工程师不同意。工人们又把这种情况反映到业余办公室，领导上说服了设计科的工程师，积极支持了他们的做法。结果，不但提前完成了任务，保证了质量，而且节约了五千八百一十四公斤钢材。
    厂的领导方面原来以为，厂里大部分工段长和车间主任，都是从老工人中提拔起来的，他们自然会有联系群众，依靠群众的工作作风。可是后来通过群众到业余办公室反映的情况看，原来厂里领导方面的估计是不完全符合实际的。有些新提拔的基层干部，往往只知道要工人完成任务，而不懂得群众路线的重大作用和意义，因此常有强迫命令的现象发生。领导干部发现这些问题后，就决定分批轮训新提拔的基层干部，向他们进行群众路线的教育。这个厂业余办公室是从去年6月下旬开始办公的，到11月底，共接见来访群众一百三十多人，他们提出问题一百七十二件。其中，除十三件尚未处理外，其余的件件有着落，事事有结果。
