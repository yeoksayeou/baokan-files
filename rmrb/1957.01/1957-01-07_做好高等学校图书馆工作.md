    Doing a Good Job in Higher Education Library Work
    Long Qian
    What is the task of a higher education library? This is something that must be clearly understood.
    A higher education library is different from a public library or a library within the research system of the Academy of Sciences. It is an important component of the university and an institution that supports teaching and scientific research. Neither teaching nor scientific research can be separated from the library. Its task is to serve teaching and scientific research.
    In the teaching process, teachers need many books and periodicals, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, to absorb the essence of the past and new achievements into the teaching materials to impart to students. The library should satisfy this need of teachers. At the same time, the library must also provide students with sufficient reference books and periodicals for study, practice, and research so that they can study on their own after class, read more and think more, to make up for the shortcomings of classroom teaching. Students can also engage in research according to their interests and hobbies, cultivating and developing their expertise. While teaching, teachers also conduct scientific research, and higher education libraries must prepare rich books, periodicals, and materials for the development of scientific research. In addition, where possible, higher education libraries should also have a good reading and research environment to better serve teachers and students.
    When sorting, purchasing, supplementing, and supplying Chinese and foreign books and periodicals, higher education libraries should correctly implement the policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." Under possible and necessary conditions, the library should be equipped with books on various schools of thought related to relevant majors. In order to meet the needs of scientific research, it is necessary to study not only the positive but also the negative; not only the materialistic but also the idealistic. Therefore, the library should carefully sort out various books and periodicals, preserve, lend, and display them separately for different readers, to facilitate free discussion and free competition, so as to promote the development of science and art. Here, it must be pointed out that the library should strengthen the procurement, supply, and publicity of Marxism-Leninism and political books. Because only in this way can we effectively criticize feudalist and capitalist ideas and ensure the guiding position of Marxism-Leninism.
    At the same time, school libraries must also pay attention to the publicity of current events and policies. In order to meet the requirements of all teachers, students, and staff in the school to study current events and policies, the library must also do a good job in supplying and publicizing books and periodicals in this area. The library should collect materials, books, periodicals, and pictures, organize and arrange them, and display them for teachers and students to read and study.
    As for the school library's book equipment, acquisition, exchange and mutual borrowing, classification and cataloging, storage and preservation, all must be carried out around the general task. However, national higher education institutions are comprehensive, multi-disciplinary, and single-disciplinary, and their tasks are different. It is necessary to develop in the direction of specialization according to the nature and tasks of one's own school, so that books and periodicals related to relevant majors can be enriched and enriched in a planned way. According to the statistics of 212 higher education institutions: only 13 schools have collections of 500,000 to 1.8 million volumes, and 95 schools have collections of 100,000 to 500,000 volumes. There are 104 schools with collections of less than 100,000 volumes. Among them, comprehensive universities, financial and economic schools, and normal schools have the highest average number of books, followed by ethnic, political science and law, engineering, foreign language, agriculture and forestry, and then medicine, art, and sports. This is in line with the trend of professional development, but it has room for development. In the future, the development of each school library should have its own characteristics. For example, geological colleges should specialize in collecting rich geological books and periodicals, art colleges should widely collect art albums, Beijing Normal University can be known for Chinese and foreign education books and periodicals, and Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen University should collect more books and materials related to Nanyang and the revolutionary history of South China in the past 100 years. In this way, each school will have its own distinct characteristics, and each major will establish a small scientific library.
    Higher education libraries have many experts and specialized talents. School leaders should pay attention to this group, give them due help and support in their work, greatly tap their potential, rely on them to improve and train existing staff and new forces, so that everyone can make good contributions in assisting teaching and scientific research.
    At present, school libraries must regularly sort out the existing backlog of more than 5 million books and periodicals, gradually solve the long-standing allocation problem, and put the existing books and periodicals into the scope of circulation and use. In addition, school libraries should also formulate annual plans for purchasing and supplementing books and periodicals, try to expand the scope of book and periodical circulation, increase the utilization rate of books and periodicals, advocate inter-library exchange and mutual borrowing, strengthen mutual assistance and cooperation with libraries in various systems, and try to supply teaching and scientific research with useful books and periodicals.

    做好高等学校图书馆工作
    龙潜
    高等学校图书馆的任务是什么？这是必须把它弄明白的。
    高等学校图书馆，它既不同于公共图书馆，也不同于科学院研究系统的图书馆。它是学校的一个重要的组成部分，它是辅助教学和科学研究的机构，无论进行教学或者开展科学研究，都不能离开图书馆。它的任务就是为教学和科学研究服务。
    在教学过程中，教师需要许多古今中外的书刊，以便将过去的精华和新的成就吸收进教材里去传授给学生。图书馆在这方面是应该满足教师的这种要求的。同时图书馆也必须供给学生学习、实习、研究以足够的参考书刊，以便他们在课外自修，能够多读书多思考，以弥补课堂讲授的不足。学生也可以根据自己的志趣和爱好，从事研究，培养和发挥他们的专长。在进行教学的同时教师还要进行科学研究，高等学校的图书馆就必须为开展科学研究准备丰富的书刊和资料。此外，在可能的条件下，高等学校的图书馆还要有良好的阅读和研究的环境，更好地为教师和学生服务。
    高等学校图书馆在整理、采购、补充、供应中外书刊时，都应该正确执行百花齐放、百家争鸣政策。图书馆在可能与需要的条件下，要分别配备有关专业的各派学说的书籍。为了满足科学研究的需要，不只要研究正面的，而且也要研究反面的；不只要研究唯物的，而且也要研究唯心的。因此图书馆应该很好地清理各种书刊，分别保存、借出、陈列以供不同对象阅读，便利于自由讨论和自由竞赛，以推动科学和艺术的发展。在这里，必须指出图书馆应该加强对马克思列宁主义和政治书刊的采购、供应和宣传工作。因为这样才能有力地进行对封建主义的、资本主义的思想的批判，才能保证马克思列宁主义思想的指导地位。
    同时学校图书馆也必须注意时事政策的宣传。图书馆为了满足全校师生员工学习时事政策的要求，又必须作好这一方面书刊的供应、宣传工作。图书馆应该搜集资料、书刊、图片加以整理、组织，展览陈列出来，供给师生阅览和研究。
    至于学校图书馆的图书设备，采访购置，交换互借，分类编目，贮藏保管，都必须围绕总的任务来进行。但是全国高等学校有综合性的，有多科性的，有单科性的，任务各有不同。必须按照自己学校的性质和任务向专业方向发展，使有关专业的书刊有计划地充实和丰富起来。根据二百一十二所高等学校的统计：藏书五十万至一百八十万册的学校才十三个，十万至五十万册的便占九十五个。藏书十万册以下的则有一百零四个。其中综合大学、财经和师范学校藏书的平均数较多，民族、政法、工科、外语、农林次之，医药、艺术、体育则不多。这是合乎专业发展的趋势的，但是，它有发展的余地。今后各校图书馆的发展都应有它的特点，如地质学院专门搜集丰富的地质书刊，美术院校则应广罗美术图册，北京师范大学可以中外教育书刊见长，广州中山大学应多多搜集有关南洋的图书资料和华南近百年来的革命史迹。这样使每个学校都有它显著的特点，每个专业都将建立一个小的科学图书馆。
    高等学校图书馆有不少专家和专材。学校领导方面应该重视这批力量，在工作上给予应有的帮助和支持，大大发挥他们的潜力，依靠他们来提高和培养现有工作人员及新生力量，使大家在辅助教学和科学研究方面作出很好的贡献。
    目前，学校图书馆要把现有积压着的五百多万册书刊定期整理出来，逐步解决长期存在的调拨问题，使现有书刊投入流通使用的范围。此外，学校图书馆还应该订出年度的采购补充书刊计划，设法扩大书刊流通范围，提高书刊的使用率，提倡馆际交换互借，加强同各系统图书馆的互助合作，尽量供应教学和科学研究以有用的书刊。
