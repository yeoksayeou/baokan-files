Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 24th: Egyptian President Nasser said on the 23rd that the actions of Western countries in proposing suggestions in the United Nations to internationalize the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba "will cause new disputes in this region. This is tantamount to supporting aggression and benefiting the aggressor. These areas are part of Egyptian territory, and any infringement on Egyptian territory is an infringement on Egyptian sovereignty, which we completely oppose."
    He made these remarks when receiving the Chinese journalist delegation at the Presidential Palace. Yuan Xinhu, Cultural Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Egypt, accompanied the Chinese journalist delegation. The Chinese journalist delegation was composed of reporters from People's Daily, Xinhua News Agency, Guangming Daily, and People's China.
    President Nasser said that he initially thought that measures would be taken within Israel to stop its aggression. On the contrary, some measures that infringed on Egyptian territory were proposed. This is dealing with Egypt. This will affect the peace of the region, and we will never accept it.
    President Nasser, when talking about Sino-Egyptian relations, said that his visit to China, which is likely to take place this summer, will help expand the relations between Egypt and China in many aspects, just as it was during his first meeting with Premier Zhou Enlai in Bandung.
    Nasser expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people for their support in the Egyptian people's struggle against aggression. He also expressed his gratitude to Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai. He also expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people for their assistance to the victims of Port Said.
    President Nasser, when talking about his views on further developing the relations between China and Egypt, said that the relationship is developing very rapidly. He said that in Bandung, he agreed with Premier Zhou Enlai that China and Egypt must cooperate on a large scale. Cooperation began in trade and culture, and then led to the establishment of diplomatic relations. He said that Egypt is striving to expand existing trade and cultural relations. At present, Egypt is importing many materials needed by Egypt from China. He hopes that this cooperation will develop because it is based on the principles of the Bandung Conference and is therefore beneficial.
    President Nasser pointed out, when talking about the issue of Israeli withdrawal, that the resolution passed by the United Nations on November 2 last year clearly stipulates that Israeli troops should withdraw behind the armistice line and that the Suez Canal should be cleared. Both Egypt and Israel have agreed to abide by this resolution. In addition, Egypt has provided all facilities for the clearing work. The resolution of the United Nations on November 5 last year also clearly stated the decision on the United Nations Emergency Force. According to this resolution, the Emergency Force cannot operate in Egypt without Egypt's consent. The whole world attaches importance to the measures concerning the Emergency Force and considers it a new way to maintain peace. To transform the main purpose of this force from a peace-keeping force to an occupying force that guarantees the interests and opinions of colonial countries would undermine the original proposition. If the peace-keeping force is to become a force for ruling, then Egypt must also change its attitude and treat it as a force for ruling.
    The actions taken by the United Nations in response to the recent aggression have greatly enhanced its prestige. If it gives in to the conspiracies of colonial countries, it will greatly damage its prestige.
    A Chinese reporter asked about the significance of the recent summit of the four Arab countries. President Nasser pointed out that before the Cairo Conference, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt had reached an agreement to adopt the spirit of complete independence of the Bandung Conference. These countries declared that they were in favor of the principles of non-alignment and non-interference and were willing to cooperate with Jordan to free it from colonial rule. Jordan also participated in the conference this time, and everyone reached an agreement on the issue of aid to Jordan. In fact, the main goal is freedom, and this action will help free Arab countries strengthen the principle of opposing any foreign interference.
    He pointed out that the Baghdad Pact was a turning point in the history of the region. All Arab people oppose this treaty, believing it is something aimed at permanently preserving foreign rule. Because Iraq and Turkey joined this treaty, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt reached an agreement to try to defend themselves. The Baghdad Pact countries tried to bring Jordan into the treaty, while these three countries tried to influence Jordan to not participate in the treaty. This struggle lasted for two years, and the meeting recently held in Cairo ended this struggle.
    He also said that Yemen joined the ranks of free Arab countries six months ago. He believes that this is the reason why Britain is now attacking Yemen after the failure of its adventure in Port Said.
    President Nasser said: "Simply put, we oppose any military alliance that would oppress us. I think the battle is still going on, and we are at one of those decisive stages. The colonial countries want to pull us into treaties, but we want independence and freedom."
    Regarding Eisenhower's Middle East plan, President Nasser said that Egypt has not yet decided to formally announce its attitude, although Egypt's principles are well known to everyone, and Egypt is absolutely not prepared to change its attitude. He said that the American plan is vague and needs many explanations. He said that his country has asked the US government for explanations. After the explanations are made, the Egyptian government will state its views.
    When asked about the solution to the Suez issue, Nasser said that Egypt's attitude on this issue is well known to everyone. He also said that the Suez issue was artificially created by the colonial countries. According to the lease granted by the Egyptian government eighty-seven years ago, Egypt should take over the management of the canal in twelve years. The management of the canal or the relationship between Egypt and the countries using the canal has been stipulated by the 1888 Convention. After Egypt nationalized the canal company, Britain and France raised the issue of how to use the canal.
    Nasser recounted that he had asked Australian Prime Minister Menzies what the situation would be in twelve years, and the latter suggested that negotiations must be held to determine the future of the canal. The President said that he told Menzies that this was a new form of rule disguised under the name of international management. He said he wanted to call it collective colonialism. Egypt did not nationalize the canal because it was part of Egyptian territory; Egypt only nationalized the canal company.
    Nasser continued that the idea of an international association of users is also very strange. If everything used by people all over the world can be placed under international control, then automobiles, steel, British ports, the US dollar, and the British pound should all be internationalized. It can be seen that internationalization is not a fair solution. Big countries want to use this method to punish Egypt because they do not want Egypt to achieve freedom.
    Egypt is willing to engage in international cooperation, but it cannot agree to any form of international rule. It has reiterated its support for the 1888 Convention. The colonial countries tried every means to obstruct the navigation of the canal, such as the practice of withdrawing foreign pilots. Despite this, Egypt has shown that it is capable of operating the canal. From July 26 (the date of nationalizing the canal company) to October 30 (the day after the invasion was launched), no incidents occurred in the canal.
    In order to achieve a peaceful solution, Egypt had agreed to negotiate with Britain and France. Egypt received a letter from United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, who suggested October 29 as the date for resuming negotiations. While suggesting negotiations, Britain and France were planning an invasion, and they chose October 29 to launch an attack on Egypt. Therefore, the negotiations did not take place, but an attack was launched on Egypt.
    During the talks, Egypt was prepared to guarantee freedom of navigation for all countries and determine the canal's tolls, which are the two most important issues for all countries. The colonial countries always wanted to control the canal, but because the canal is part of Egypt, they cannot control the canal.
    When talking about Egypt's economic development plan, Nasser said that the research work on the five-year plan had begun three years ago, but it was unsuccessful due to a lack of statistical materials. Therefore, the five-year plan was postponed and replaced by annual plans. At the same time, work is underway to collect complete statistics. The outline of the five-year plan has not yet been completed, and the main difficulty is how to formulate the plan. He said that consultants from India, France, and Germany have been invited to work on the plan. The general outline of the industrial and agricultural plans in the five-year plan has now been drafted, but it will take another five months to complete the overall plan.
    Nasser pointed out that the new Egyptian government announced at the beginning of the revolution that it intended to fulfill all the promises made by the previous governments from 1925 to 1952. The steel plant currently under construction was promised in 1930, the Aswan Dam electrification project was promised in 1925, and a fertilizer plant was promised in 1935. Now all these promises will be fulfilled.
    When asked about the issue of nationalizing foreign banks and companies, Nasser said that after the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, it gradually became clear from various signs that the British and French banks in Egypt were carrying out activities detrimental to our country, with the aim of undermining Egypt's economy from within. The capital of these banks totaled 2 million Egyptian pounds, but the Egyptian deposits and savings they controlled totaled 70 million Egyptian pounds. These banks began to stop issuing loans for cotton, industry, and commerce, attempting to influence cotton trade and causing unemployment in factories. After the invasion, we learned that these banks had attempted to create unrest within Egypt under the orders of London and Paris. Therefore, the government decided to nationalize all foreign banks in five years to ensure Egypt's security.
    Nasser also talked about the activities of British and French corporate stock agents, who attempted to influence the market to achieve what they had not achieved by force. He said that Egypt is not opposed to all foreign enterprises, and foreign enterprises may be beneficial to Egypt's industrialization. However, enterprises that invest one million pounds and earn one hundred million pounds and use this money to oppose the Egyptian people cannot be tolerated.
    At the end of the meeting, the Chinese journalists presented gifts to President Nasser. The gift was a wooden carving with the four characters "Serve the Country with Utmost Loyalty" carved on it.

### 纳赛尔对中国新闻工作者发表谈话  埃及正尽力扩大中埃友好合作关系  反对把加沙地区和亚喀巴湾国际化的阴谋

    纳赛尔对中国新闻工作者发表谈话
    埃及正尽力扩大中埃友好合作关系
    反对把加沙地区和亚喀巴湾国际化的阴谋
    新华社开罗24日电　埃及总统纳赛尔23日说，西方国家在联合国提出要求使加沙地区和亚喀巴湾国际化的建议这一类行动，“将会引起这个地区的新纠纷。这等于是支持侵略而且使侵略者得到好处。这些地区是埃及领土的一部分，任何侵犯埃及领土的行为都是我们所完全反对的侵犯埃及主权的行为”。
    他是在总统府接见中国新闻工作者代表团时说这些话的。陪同中国新闻工作者代表团受接见的有中国驻埃及大使馆文化参赞袁心湖。中国新闻工作者代表团由人民日报、新华社、光明日报和人民中国的记者组成。
    纳赛尔总统说，他起初认为会在以色列境内采取措施来制止它的侵略的。恰恰相反，有人却提出了一些侵犯埃及领土的措施。这就是对付埃及了。这将影响这个地区的和平，我们决不会接受它。
    纳赛尔总统在谈到中埃关系时说，他大概将在今年夏天成行的对中国的访问，将有助于扩大埃及和中国在许多方面的关系，就像他在万隆初次会晤周恩来总理时的情形那样。
    纳赛尔对中国人民在埃及人民反抗侵略的斗争中给予的支持表示感谢。他还表示感谢毛泽东主席和周恩来总理。他也对中国人民给予塞得港受难者的援助表示感谢。
    纳赛尔总统在谈到他对进一步发展中埃两国关系的见解时说，关系正在非常迅速地发展着。他说，在万隆的时候，他就同意周恩来总理的意见，认为中埃两国必须大规模地合作。合作是在贸易和文化方面开始的，然后导致了外交关系的建立。他说，埃及正在尽力扩大现有的贸易和文化关系。目前，埃及正从中国进口许多埃及所需要的物资。他希望这种合作发展起来，因为它是以万隆会议的原则为基础的，因而也是有益的。
    纳赛尔总统在谈到以色列撤军问题时指出，联合国在去年11月2日通过的决议清楚地规定，以色列军队应当撤退到停战线后面去和应当清理苏伊士运河。埃及和以色列都同意遵守这个决议。此外，埃及已经对清理工作提供了一切便利。联合国去年11月5日的决议中也清楚地说明了关于联合国紧急部队的决定。根据这项决议，紧急部队如果没有得到埃及同意就不能在埃及活动。全世界都重视关于紧急部队的措施，认为这是维护和平的一个新办法。要把这支部队的主要目的从作为一支维护和平的部队转变为保障殖民国家的利益和意见的占领军，那就破坏了原来的主张。如果维护和平的军队要变成一支进行统治的军队，那么埃及也要改变态度，把它当作一支进行统治的军队。
    联合国对最近的侵略所采取的行动，大大提高了它的威信。如果它在殖民主义国家的阴谋面前退让的话，那就会大大破坏它的威信。
    中国记者问到最近四个阿拉伯国家首脑会议的意义。纳赛尔总统指出，在开罗会议以前，叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯和埃及三国曾经达成协议，决定采取万隆会议的完全独立精神的思想。这些国家声明，它们赞成不参加集团和不干涉的原则，并且愿意同约旦合作以使它摆脱殖民主义统治。这次约旦也参加了会议，大家就援助约旦问题达成了协议。实际上主要的目标是自由，而这个行动将有助于自由的阿拉伯国家加强反对任何外国干涉的原则。
    他指出，巴格达条约是这个地区历史上的一个转折点。全体阿拉伯人民反对这项条约，认为这是一种目的在于永久保存外国统治的东西。由于伊拉克和土耳其参加了这项条约，叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯和埃及就达成了协定来设法自卫。巴格达条约国家设法拉约旦参加条约，而这三国就设法影响约旦要它不参加这项条约。这种斗争曾经持续了两年，最近在开罗举行的会议才结束了这种斗争。
    他还说，也门在六个月以前参加了自由阿拉伯国家的行列。他认为这就是英国在塞得港的冒险失败之后现在又进攻也门的原因。
    纳赛尔总统说：“简单地说，我们反对任何会压迫我们的军事联盟。我认为战斗仍然在进行，我们是处在那些决定性阶段中的一个阶段。殖民国家想把我们拉到条约中去，我们却要独立和自由。”
    关于艾森豪威尔的中东计划，纳赛尔总统说，埃及现在还没有决定正式宣布它的态度，虽然埃及的原则大家都知道得很清楚，而且埃及也绝不准备改变它的态度。他说，美国的计划是含糊不清的，是需要许多解释的。他说，他的国家已经要求美国政府解释。在作出解释之后，埃及政府将表明它的看法。
    记者问到苏伊士问题的解决办法，纳赛尔说，埃及对这个问题的态度是大家都知道的。他又说，苏伊士问题是由殖民国家人为地制造出来的。根据埃及政府在八十七年以前所给予的租借权，埃及应在十二年以后接管运河的管理工作。运河的管理或埃及同使用运河的国家之间的关系已经由1888年公约加以规定。在埃及把运河公司收归国有后，英法才提出怎样使用运河的问题。
    纳赛尔追述说，他曾经问过澳大利亚总理孟席斯，十二年后情况将怎样呢，而后者暗示，必须举行谈判来决定运河的前途问题。总统说，他对孟席斯说，这是以国际管理的名义伪装的一种新的统治。他说，他想叫它做集体殖民主义。埃及并没有把运河收归国有，因为那是埃及领土的一部分；埃及只是把运河公司收归国有吧了。
    纳赛尔继续说，国际使用国协会这种主意也是很奇怪的。如果全世界的人所使用的东西都可以放在国际控制之下的话，那么汽车、钢铁、英国港口、美元和英镑都应当国际化。由此可见，国际化不是一个公平的解决办法，大国想用这种办法来惩罚埃及，因为它们不希望埃及实现自由。
    埃及愿意进行国际合作，但是它不能同意任何一种国际统治。它已经重申它支持1888年公约。殖民国家千方百计地阻挠运河的通航，譬如把外国领航员撤走的做法就是一个例子。尽管这样，埃及还是表现出它是能够经营运河的。从7月26日（把运河公司收归国有的日期）到10月30日（侵略发动以后的一天）这一段时期内，运河中没有发生过任何事件。
    为了取得和平解决，埃及曾经同意同英法两国进行谈判。埃及接到了联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的信，他建议以10月29日作为恢复谈判的日期。在建议进行谈判的同时，英法两国却在策划着侵略，它们选择了10月29日对埃及发动进攻。因此谈判没有进行，而是对埃及发动了进攻。
    在会谈的时候，埃及准备保证一切国家的自由航行和确定运河的通行税，这是关系到一切国家的最重要的两个问题。殖民国家总归是想控制运河的，可是由于运河是埃及的一部分，它们想要控制运河是办不到的。
    纳赛尔在谈到埃及的经济发展计划时说，关于五年计划的研究工作在三年前就已经开始，可是由于缺乏统计材料而没有成功。因此五年计划推迟了，而代之以年度计划。同时，正在进行搜集完整的统计数字的工作。五年计划的纲要还没有完成，主要的困难是怎样制订计划。他说，印度、法国和德国的顾问人员已被请来为计划进行工作。五年计划中的工业和农业计划的总纲，现在已经拟好，可是还需要五个月的时间来完成总计划。
    纳赛尔指出，埃及新政府在革命开始的时候宣布它打算把1925年到1952年之间的历届政府所作的诺言都加以实现。现在正在建设的炼钢厂是在1930年许下的，阿斯旺水坝电气化计划是在1925年许下的，而一个肥料工厂是1935年许下的。现在所有这些诺言都将履行。
    记者问到关于把外国银行和公司收归埃及人所有的问题，纳赛尔说，在苏伊士运河公司国有化以后，从各种迹象逐渐看出英法在埃及的银行在进行不利于我国的活动，目的是从内部破坏埃及的经济。这些银行的资本共计二百万埃镑，然而由它们支配的埃及人存款和储蓄共达七千万埃镑。这些银行开始停止发放棉花、工业和商业贷款，企图影响棉花贸易，并且在工厂中引起失业。在侵略发生以后，我们知道这些银行曾经奉伦敦和巴黎的命令企图在埃及内部制造骚乱。因此政府才决定为了保证埃及的安全在五年中把一切外国银行收归埃及人所有。
    纳赛尔还谈到英法企业的股票代理商的活动，他们企图影响市场来达到他们用武力所没有达到的目的。他说，埃及不是反对所有的外国企业，外国企业可能对埃及工业化有好处。但是决不能容忍那些投资一百万镑而获利一亿镑，而且用这笔钱来反对埃及人民的企业。
    在接见结束的时候，中国新闻工作者们向纳赛尔总统献赠了礼品。礼品是一件木制雕刻品，上面雕的是“精忠报国”四个字。
