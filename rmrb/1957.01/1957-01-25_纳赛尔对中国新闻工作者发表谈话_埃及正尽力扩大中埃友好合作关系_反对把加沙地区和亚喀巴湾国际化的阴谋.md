Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 24th: Egyptian President Nasser said on the 23rd that the actions of Western countries in proposing suggestions in the United Nations to internationalize the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba "will cause new disputes in this region. This is tantamount to supporting aggression and benefiting the aggressor. These areas are part of Egyptian territory, and any infringement on Egyptian territory is an infringement on Egyptian sovereignty, which we completely oppose."
    He made these remarks when receiving the Chinese journalist delegation at the Presidential Palace. Yuan Xinhu, Cultural Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Egypt, accompanied the Chinese journalist delegation. The Chinese journalist delegation was composed of reporters from People's Daily, Xinhua News Agency, Guangming Daily, and People's China.
    President Nasser said that he initially thought that measures would be taken within Israel to stop its aggression. On the contrary, some measures that infringed on Egyptian territory were proposed. This is dealing with Egypt. This will affect the peace of the region, and we will never accept it.
    President Nasser, when talking about Sino-Egyptian relations, said that his visit to China, which is likely to take place this summer, will help expand the relations between Egypt and China in many aspects, just as it was during his first meeting with Premier Zhou Enlai in Bandung.
    Nasser expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people for their support in the Egyptian people's struggle against aggression. He also expressed his gratitude to Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai. He also expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people for their assistance to the victims of Port Said.
    President Nasser, when talking about his views on further developing the relations between China and Egypt, said that the relationship is developing very rapidly. He said that in Bandung, he agreed with Premier Zhou Enlai that China and Egypt must cooperate on a large scale. Cooperation began in trade and culture, and then led to the establishment of diplomatic relations. He said that Egypt is striving to expand existing trade and cultural relations. At present, Egypt is importing many materials needed by Egypt from China. He hopes that this cooperation will develop because it is based on the principles of the Bandung Conference and is therefore beneficial.
    President Nasser pointed out, when talking about the issue of Israeli withdrawal, that the resolution passed by the United Nations on November 2 last year clearly stipulates that Israeli troops should withdraw behind the armistice line and that the Suez Canal should be cleared. Both Egypt and Israel have agreed to abide by this resolution. In addition, Egypt has provided all facilities for the clearing work. The resolution of the United Nations on November 5 last year also clearly stated the decision on the United Nations Emergency Force. According to this resolution, the Emergency Force cannot operate in Egypt without Egypt's consent. The whole world attaches importance to the measures concerning the Emergency Force and considers it a new way to maintain peace. To transform the main purpose of this force from a peace-keeping force to an occupying force that guarantees the interests and opinions of colonial countries would undermine the original proposition. If the peace-keeping force is to become a force for ruling, then Egypt must also change its attitude and treat it as a force for ruling.
    The actions taken by the United Nations in response to the recent aggression have greatly enhanced its prestige. If it gives in to the conspiracies of colonial countries, it will greatly damage its prestige.
    A Chinese reporter asked about the significance of the recent summit of the four Arab countries. President Nasser pointed out that before the Cairo Conference, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt had reached an agreement to adopt the spirit of complete independence of the Bandung Conference. These countries declared that they were in favor of the principles of non-alignment and non-interference and were willing to cooperate with Jordan to free it from colonial rule. Jordan also participated in the conference this time, and everyone reached an agreement on the issue of aid to Jordan. In fact, the main goal is freedom, and this action will help free Arab countries strengthen the principle of opposing any foreign interference.
    He pointed out that the Baghdad Pact was a turning point in the history of the region. All Arab people oppose this treaty, believing it is something aimed at permanently preserving foreign rule. Because Iraq and Turkey joined this treaty, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt reached an agreement to try to defend themselves. The Baghdad Pact countries tried to bring Jordan into the treaty, while these three countries tried to influence Jordan to not participate in the treaty. This struggle lasted for two years, and the meeting recently held in Cairo ended this struggle.
    He also said that Yemen joined the ranks of free Arab countries six months ago. He believes that this is the reason why Britain is now attacking Yemen after the failure of its adventure in Port Said.
    President Nasser said: "Simply put, we oppose any military alliance that would oppress us. I think the battle is still going on, and we are at one of those decisive stages. The colonial countries want to pull us into treaties, but we want independence and freedom."
    Regarding Eisenhower's Middle East plan, President Nasser said that Egypt has not yet decided to formally announce its attitude, although Egypt's principles are well known to everyone, and Egypt is absolutely not prepared to change its attitude. He said that the American plan is vague and needs many explanations. He said that his country has asked the US government for explanations. After the explanations are made, the Egyptian government will state its views.
    When asked about the solution to the Suez issue, Nasser said that Egypt's attitude on this issue is well known to everyone. He also said that the Suez issue was artificially created by the colonial countries. According to the lease granted by the Egyptian government eighty-seven years ago, Egypt should take over the management of the canal in twelve years. The management of the canal or the relationship between Egypt and the countries using the canal has been stipulated by the 1888 Convention. After Egypt nationalized the canal company, Britain and France raised the issue of how to use the canal.
    Nasser recounted that he had asked Australian Prime Minister Menzies what the situation would be in twelve years, and the latter suggested that negotiations must be held to determine the future of the canal. The President said that he told Menzies that this was a new form of rule disguised under the name of international management. He said he wanted to call it collective colonialism. Egypt did not nationalize the canal because it was part of Egyptian territory; Egypt only nationalized the canal company.
    Nasser continued that the idea of an international association of users is also very strange. If everything used by people all over the world can be placed under international control, then automobiles, steel, British ports, the US dollar, and the British pound should all be internationalized. It can be seen that internationalization is not a fair solution. Big countries want to use this method to punish Egypt because they do not want Egypt to achieve freedom.
    Egypt is willing to engage in international cooperation, but it cannot agree to any form of international rule. It has reiterated its support for the 1888 Convention. The colonial countries tried every means to obstruct the navigation of the canal, such as the practice of withdrawing foreign pilots. Despite this, Egypt has shown that it is capable of operating the canal. From July 26 (the date of nationalizing the canal company) to October 30 (the day after the invasion was launched), no incidents occurred in the canal.
    In order to achieve a peaceful solution, Egypt had agreed to negotiate with Britain and France. Egypt received a letter from United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskj√∂ld, who suggested October 29 as the date for resuming negotiations. While suggesting negotiations, Britain and France were planning an invasion, and they chose October 29 to launch an attack on Egypt. Therefore, the negotiations did not take place, but an attack was launched on Egypt.
    During the talks, Egypt was prepared to guarantee freedom of navigation for all countries and determine the canal's tolls, which are the two most important issues for all countries. The colonial countries always wanted to control the canal, but because the canal is part of Egypt, they cannot control the canal.
    When talking about Egypt's economic development plan, Nasser said that the research work on the five-year plan had begun three years ago, but it was unsuccessful due to a lack of statistical materials. Therefore, the five-year plan was postponed and replaced by annual plans. At the same time, work is underway to collect complete statistics. The outline of the five-year plan has not yet been completed, and the main difficulty is how to formulate the plan. He said that consultants from India, France, and Germany have been invited to work on the plan. The general outline of the industrial and agricultural plans in the five-year plan has now been drafted, but it will take another five months to complete the overall plan.
    Nasser pointed out that the new Egyptian government announced at the beginning of the revolution that it intended to fulfill all the promises made by the previous governments from 1925 to 1952. The steel plant currently under construction was promised in 1930, the Aswan Dam electrification project was promised in 1925, and a fertilizer plant was promised in 1935. Now all these promises will be fulfilled.
    When asked about the issue of nationalizing foreign banks and companies, Nasser said that after the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, it gradually became clear from various signs that the British and French banks in Egypt were carrying out activities detrimental to our country, with the aim of undermining Egypt's economy from within. The capital of these banks totaled 2 million Egyptian pounds, but the Egyptian deposits and savings they controlled totaled 70 million Egyptian pounds. These banks began to stop issuing loans for cotton, industry, and commerce, attempting to influence cotton trade and causing unemployment in factories. After the invasion, we learned that these banks had attempted to create unrest within Egypt under the orders of London and Paris. Therefore, the government decided to nationalize all foreign banks in five years to ensure Egypt's security.
    Nasser also talked about the activities of British and French corporate stock agents, who attempted to influence the market to achieve what they had not achieved by force. He said that Egypt is not opposed to all foreign enterprises, and foreign enterprises may be beneficial to Egypt's industrialization. However, enterprises that invest one million pounds and earn one hundred million pounds and use this money to oppose the Egyptian people cannot be tolerated.
    At the end of the meeting, the Chinese journalists presented gifts to President Nasser. The gift was a wooden carving with the four characters "Serve the Country with Utmost Loyalty" carved on it.
