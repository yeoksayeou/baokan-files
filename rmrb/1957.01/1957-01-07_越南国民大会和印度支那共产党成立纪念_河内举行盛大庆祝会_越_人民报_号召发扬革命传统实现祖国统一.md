Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 6th: The people of Hanoi celebrated the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the Vietnamese National Assembly and the twenty-seventh anniversary of the founding of the Indochinese Communist Party, the predecessor of the Vietnam Workers' Party, by raising flags throughout the city today.

	At 4 p.m., a grand tea party celebrating the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the National Assembly was held at the Ba Dinh Club in Hanoi. President Ho Chi Minh and all the deputies attending the sixth session of the National Assembly attended the tea party.
	Party and Youth League organizations of various agencies in Hanoi held celebrations this morning to commemorate the Party's birthday.
Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 6th: Today is the 27th anniversary of the founding of the Indochinese Communist Party, the predecessor of the Vietnam Workers' Party. The "People's Daily," the organ of the Vietnam Workers' Party, published an editorial entitled "The Glorious History of the Indochinese Communist Party," stating that since the day the Indochinese Communist Party was born, under the illumination of Marxism-Leninism, the Vietnamese revolution has entered a new stage.

	The editorial said that in the past twenty-seven years, the Vietnamese people and the working class have, successively under the leadership of the Indochinese Communist Party and the Vietnam Workers' Party, carried out very heroic and glorious revolutionary struggles.

	The "People's Daily" then described the Party's victorious activities in various revolutionary periods and said: The glorious history of our Party and our nation over the past twenty-seven years proves that under the leadership of a party representing the most resolute revolutionary class, resolutely representing the highest interests of the motherland, and possessing a correct revolutionary line, no matter how vicious the enemies of the revolution may be, they are destined to fail, and our revolution will surely succeed. The people of our country, who once defeated French imperialism and eliminated feudalism in North Vietnam, will certainly be able to crush the conspiracies of US imperialism and its lackeys to obstruct our country's reunification. The important thing is that our people must be united and full of confidence at all times.

	The editorial emphasized that in the twenty-seven years, while achieving brilliant victories, our Party and the Vietnamese revolution have also suffered temporary and partial failures. When victorious, Party members did not become complacent; when encountering difficulties and temporary or partial failures, Party members did not panic or waver. This is a good tradition of our Party. This tradition must be highly promoted.

	The "People's Daily" concluded by saying that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Ho Chi Minh, including outstanding comrades of the Party, our entire Party is united and working hard for the great cause of the people and the class, and the final victory will surely be ours.

	(Editor's Note) The Indochinese Communist Party was founded on January 6, 1930. It is the vanguard organization of the working class and working people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. President Ho Chi Minh was the founder and leader of the Indochinese Communist Party.

	From the day the Indochinese Communist Party was founded, President Ho Chi Minh and the Party stipulated that the tasks of the Vietnamese revolution were to oppose imperialism and feudalism, and its nature was a national, democratic revolution. The Party's first program clearly put forward the slogans of national liberation and land reform. In the twenty years after its founding, the Indochinese Communist Party victoriously led the broad masses of people in carrying out the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution and achieved brilliant achievements. It has experienced the following arduous and glorious revolutionary stages: the high tide of worker-peasant struggles and the Nghe An uprising in 1930, the democratic movement from 1936 to 1939, the struggle against Japanese and French imperialism from 1940 to 1944, the movement against Japan and for national liberation in 1945 and the "August Revolution," and the period of resistance and national construction after 1945.

	With the development of the revolutionary situation, the Second National Congress of the Indochinese Communist Party held in February 1951 decided to change the Party's organization in Vietnam to the Vietnam Workers' Party and formulated a new Party program and constitution. From that time on, the Vietnam Workers' Party continued to lead the Vietnamese people in carrying out the war of resistance and national construction, and achieved great victories.

    越南国民大会和印度支那共产党成立纪念
    河内举行盛大庆祝会
    越“人民报”号召发扬革命传统实现祖国统一
    新华社河内6日电　河内全市人民今天悬旗庆祝越南国民大会成立十一周年和越南劳动党的前身印度支那共产党成立二十七周年。
      下午四时，在河内巴亭俱乐部举行了盛大的庆祝国民大会成立十一周年的茶会，胡志明主席和参加国民大会第六次会议的全体议员参加了这次茶会。
    河内各机关的党、团组织在今天上午举行庆祝会，纪念党的生日。
    新华社河内6日电　今天是越南劳动党的前身——印度支那共产党诞生二十七周年纪念日。越南劳动党机关报“人民报”以“印度支那共产党的光辉历史”为题发表社论说，自从印度支那共产党诞生的那一天起，在马克思列宁主义的照耀下，越南革命转入了一个新的阶段。
    社论说，在过去二十七年中，越南人民和工人阶级先后在印度支那共产党和越南劳动党的领导下，进行了非常英勇和光辉的革命斗争。
      “人民报”接着叙述了党在各个革命时期的胜利活动，并且说：我党和我们民族二十七年来的光辉的历史证明，在代表着最坚决革命的阶级、坚决代表着祖国的最高利益和具有正确革命路线的政党的领导下，不管革命的敌人是怎么样恶毒，它们是注定要失败的，我国革命一定会获得成功。曾经打败法帝国主义、在北越消灭了封建主义的我国人民，一定能够粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗企图阻碍我国统一事业的阴谋。重要的问题是，不论在任何时候，我们人民都必须团结和满怀信心。
    社论强调说，二十七年来，我党和越南革命在取得光辉胜利的同时，也遭到过暂时和局部的失败。胜利的时候，党员没有自满；遭到困难和暂时或局部的失败的时候，党员没有慌乱、动摇，这是我党的良好传统。这个传统必须得到高度的发扬。
      “人民报”最后说，在以胡志明同志为首的、包括党的出色同志在内的党中央委员会的领导下，我们全党上下一心，为人民、阶级的伟大的事业而努力奋斗，最后的胜利一定是我们的。
      （编者注）　印度支那共产党成立于1930年1月6日。它是越南、高棉和寮国工人阶级和劳动人民的先锋队组织。胡志明主席是印度支那共产党的缔造者和领袖。
    从印度支那共产党成立之日起，胡志明主席和党就规定了越南革命的任务是反帝国主义、反封建主义，它的性质是民族的、民主的革命。党的第一个纲领明确地提出民族解放和土地改革的口号。印度支那共产党在它成立以后的二十年中，胜利地领导广大人民群众进行了反帝反封建的革命，并取得了辉煌的成就。它曾经历过以下几个艰苦而又光荣的革命阶段：工农斗争高潮和1930年的宜安起义，1936年至1939年的民主运动，1940年至1944年的抵抗日、法帝国主义的斗争，1945年的反抗日本、争取民族解放的运动和“八月革命”，以及1945年以后的抗战和国家建设时期。
    随着革命形势的发展，1951年2月召开的印度支那共产党第二次全国代表大会决定把党在越南的组织改为越南劳动党，并拟定了新的党纲和党章。从那时起，越南劳动党就继续领导越南人民进行抗战和国家建设，获得了伟大的胜利。
