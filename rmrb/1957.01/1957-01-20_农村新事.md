New Developments in the Countryside

    A Little Pig-Raising Expert
    Zhang Xian, a girl of fourteen or fifteen years old, is a little pig-raising expert at the Victory Agricultural Cooperative in Dahuting Township, Mi County, Henan Province.
    In 1955, her father bought a piglet. At that time, the family even lacked grain for themselves, so where would they find grain to feed the pig? The family only complained. But little Zhang Xian thought: If we feed it more leaves and less grain, can't we still fatten the pig?
    Every day she carried a vegetable basket everywhere to pick leaves. After collecting the leaves, she and her grandmother boiled water to cook vegetables for the pig to eat. In this way, using only eighteen catties of grain, they raised a piglet weighing a few catties into a fat pig weighing one hundred and forty catties.
    In October of that year, her father sold the pig for thirty-one yuan, and the pig manure sold to the cooperative brought in another seventeen yuan, making the whole family so happy they couldn't stop grinning.
    In 1956, the cooperative promoted Zhang Eryan's fermented feed pig-raising method, and selected pig-raising technicians. The little girl automatically signed up to participate in the pig-raising technology training class. Now she has become the cooperative's specialized pig-raising technician. Some time ago, she participated in the Kaifeng Special District pig-raising work conference and spoke at the meeting to spread pig-raising technology. Therefore, many people praised her, saying: Look, the little girl is small, but she is a little pig-raising expert! ·Xi Rong, Qing Ming·
    Agricultural Cooperative's Clinic
    The Happiness Road Agricultural Cooperative in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, used a set of medical equipment sent by Doctor Wu Yuchun to set up a clinic on a trial basis, which was welcomed by the members.
    In June 1956, Doctor Wu Yuchun of the public sanatorium near the Happiness Road Agricultural Cooperative donated a set of medical equipment and a microscope that he used when he ran a hospital to the agricultural cooperative, hoping to set up a clinic on a trial basis. After calculation, the cooperative cut some unnecessary expenses and put together a public welfare fund to buy daily-use medicines and pay for medical personnel. When the county health department saw that the cooperative had the conditions to set up a clinic, it sent a doctor, whose assistant was a girl who was a member of the Happiness Cooperative. In this way, more than 2,400 people in the entire cooperative no longer had to travel twelve li to the town to see a doctor. Last autumn alone, members saved hundreds of workdays by not going to town for treatment. When members go to the clinic for treatment, they do not have to pay cash, but only record the bill, which is settled at the end of the year, and therefore it is warmly welcomed by the members.

    A "Five Guarantees" Family of Different Surnames
    In the "Five-Six" Agricultural Cooperative in Zhangsanying Township, Longhua County, Hebei Province, there is a "Five Guarantees" family. This family is home to four farmers who are orphans, widows, elderly, and young.
    This "Five Guarantees" family includes Li Chunyi, a seventy-seven-year-old, blind, and single man; Wang Da Niang, a sixty-six-year-old, childless and single deaf old woman. In addition, there are two orphans, one named Cao Jinrong, who is twelve years old this year; and the other orphan named Wang Jiashan, who is fourteen years old this year.
    In the past, these four people had no one to rely on, and their food, clothing, and housing were not secure. Since the realization of advanced cooperation in Zhangsanying Township in the spring of 1956, their lives have been settled. In order to give these orphans, widows, elderly, and young people a home and mutual care, and on the principle of their voluntary participation, the cooperative helped them move together to establish a family. When distributing grain last autumn, the cooperative distributed 410 catties of grain to each of them according to the grain retention standard, and distributed some cabbage and potatoes to them. When winter came, the cooperative also made three new cotton-padded clothes inside and out for the four of them; in addition, it also made a pair of cotton shoes for the orphan Cao Jinrong. The orphans Cao Jinrong and Wang Jiashan are now going to school, and the paper, pens, ink, and inkstones they use for learning are also bought for them by the cooperative. The two old people care for them very much, as affectionately as they would for their own relatives, and the children also help the old people with some trivial matters in their lives. The family lives in harmony. According to Xinhua News Agency

    养猪小专家
    十四、五岁的小姑娘张仙，是河南省密县打虎亭乡胜利农业社的一个养猪小专家。
    1955年，她爹买了一头小猪。当时家里吃的粮食还缺，哪还有粮食喂猪呢？家里人只埋怨。小张仙却想：多喂树叶，少喂粮食，不是一样能把猪喂肥吗？
    她每天提着菜篮子到处采树叶。采回树叶她就和奶奶烧开水给猪煮菜吃。这样，只用了十八斤粮食就把几斤重的一头小猪喂成一百四十斤重的肥猪了。
    当年10月间，他爹把猪卖了，得到三十一元，猪粪卖给社里又得了十七元多，把一家人喜欢得抿不住嘴。
    1956年社内推广张二彦的发酵饲料养猪法，挑选养猪技术员，小姑娘自动报名参加了养猪技术训练班。现在她已成为社里的养猪专门技术员了。前些时她曾参加了开封专区养猪工作会议，并在会上发言传播了养猪技术。因此，不少人称赞说：看，小姑娘人小，可是个小养猪小专家！　·锡荣、清明·
    农业社的卫生所
    吉林省蛟河县幸福之路农业社，用医生吴玉春送的一套医疗器具试办了一个卫生所，受到了社员们欢迎。
    1956年6月，幸福之路农业社附近的公营疗养院医生吴玉春，把他以前开医院时使用的一套医疗器具和一台显微镜献给农业社，他希望试办卫生所。合作社经过计算，削减一部分不必要的开支，凑出一笔公益金买办日常使用的药剂和做为医务人员的开支。县卫生科看到这个社具备了举办卫生所的条件，就派去一名医生，助手是幸福社社员的姑娘。这样一来，全社二千四百多人都不用往返十二里路跑到城镇去治病了。光去年秋后，社员们不到城镇治病，就节省了几百个劳动日。社员到卫生所治病时，不用拿现款，只记笔账，到年终才结算，因而受到了社员们的热烈欢迎。

    异姓同居的“五保”之家
    在河北省隆化县张三营乡“五六”农业社里，有一户“五保”之家。这户人家住着四名孤、寡、老、幼的农民。
    这个“五保”之家，有七十七岁的、双目失明的独身汉李春义，有六十六岁、无儿无女的独身聋老太太王大娘。另外还有两个孤儿，一个叫曹金荣，今年十二岁；另一个孤儿叫王家山，今年十四岁。
    过去，这四口人无依无靠，吃、穿、住都没着落。从1956年春季张三营乡实现高级合作化后，生活都得到了安置。社里为了使这些孤、寡、老、幼生活有归宿，互相关照，并在他们自愿的原则下，帮助他们搬在一起建立了家庭。去年秋季分配粮食的时候，社里按照留粮标准分给他们每个人四百一十斤粮食，分给他们一些白菜、土豆。冬季到了，社里还给他们四口人做了里面三新棉衣；另外还给孤儿曹金荣做了一双棉鞋。孤儿曹金荣和王家山现在都上学念书了，他俩学习用的纸、笔、墨、砚，也都是社里给他们买的。两位老人对他们非常关怀，像对亲人那样亲热，孩子们也帮助老人们做些生活上的零星事。一家人过的很和气。　据新华社
