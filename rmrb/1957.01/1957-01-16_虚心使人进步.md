A relatively advanced agricultural cooperative, once it becomes famous, will have many visitors coming to observe and learn from its experiences. Naturally, it becomes a teacher to the surrounding cooperatives. However, any advanced collective or individual, if it wants to make continuous progress, should be both a teacher and a student of others at the same time.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report, the cadres of the "Road to Happiness" Agricultural Cooperative in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, which is famous throughout the country, recently discovered that there were many problems in the operation and management of their cooperative. Therefore, they went out to visit and study separately. Cooperative Director Han En led the production team leader to the nearby "Spring Light" Agricultural Cooperative to learn about labor organization, quota management, and the experience of reasonably determining the proportion of labor remuneration for agricultural and sideline occupations. Deputy Director Chi Dianwen led a group leader to the Baishan Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Jilin City to learn about diversified operations and the experience of running vegetable greenhouses well in the autumn and winter seasons. After the visits, they immediately revised the overly high sideline remuneration with reference to the experience of the Spring Light Agricultural Cooperative, thereby reversing the members' thinking of emphasizing sideline occupations and neglecting agriculture. They are also preparing to adopt other beneficial experiences of fraternal cooperatives in a planned way.

Since the "Road to Happiness" Agricultural Cooperative was established in 1952, thousands of people have come to visit every year. In 1956, more than 3,000 people came to visit, many of whom came to learn about the experience of running a cooperative. This was the first time that the cadres of this cooperative had gone to other places to learn about the experience of running a cooperative. Cooperative Director Han En said: "No matter how long an agricultural cooperative has been established, or how large or small it is, it has good experiences worth learning from." If the leading cadres of advanced agricultural cooperatives in other places also did this like the cadres of the "Road to Happiness" Agricultural Cooperative, they would certainly have the same feeling.

    虚心使人进步
    一个比较先进的农业合作社，只要一出了名，就会有许许多多的访问者来参观，来学习经验，于是它自然而然地就成了周围社的先生。但是，任何一个先进的集体、先进的个人，如果想要不断地进步，就应该在当先生的同时，又当别人的学生。
    据新华社报道，闻名全国的吉林省蛟河县幸福之路农业社的干部们，最近发现自己合作社的经营管理上存在着很多问题，于是便分头外出访问、学习。社主任韩恩带领生产队长到附近的春光农业社学习了劳动组织、定额管理、合理确定农副业劳动报酬比例的经验。副主任迟殿文率领一组长到吉林市郊白山农业社学习了多种经营、秋冬两季办好蔬菜温室的经验。访问以后，他们立即参照春光农业社的经验，修订了偏高的副业报酬，因而扭转了社员重副业轻农业的思想。他们还准备有计划地采用兄弟社的其他有益的经验。
    幸福之路农业社从1952年建立以来，每年都有上千人来参观，1956年就有三千多人来参观，其中许多人都是来学习办社经验的。这个社的干部到外地学习办社经验，这还是第一次。社主任韩恩说：“农业社不论建立时间长短，规模大小，都有值得学习的好经验。”如果其他地方的先进的农业社的领导干部，也像幸福之路农业社的干部这样去做了的话，也一定会有同样的体会。
