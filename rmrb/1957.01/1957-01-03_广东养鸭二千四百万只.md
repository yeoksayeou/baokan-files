Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou Electric Dispatch: Guangdong Province's duck population reached 24 million in 1956, an increase of approximately 50% compared to 1955.

    Currently, the supply of ducks in Guangdong Province is very sufficient. The duck supply in Guangzhou alone for the months of October and November in 1956 increased by 3.6 times compared to the same period in 1955. Because needs have been met, the market price and listed price of ducks are generally consistent after the opening of free markets in various regions. Many agricultural cooperatives also process and sell large quantities of preserved ducks.

    The number of ducks in Guangdong Province has gradually increased as agricultural cooperatives in various regions pay attention to developing sideline production. Especially in the Pearl River Delta, most agricultural cooperatives utilize the natural conditions of local crisscrossing swamps and streams to raise thousands, and even tens of thousands, of ducks.

    广东养鸭二千四百万只
    新华社广州电　广东省1956年鸭的数量达到了二千四百万只，约比1955年增加50％。
    目前广东省鸭的供应量很充足。单广州市1956年10、11两个月鸭的应供量，就比1955年同期增加了三点六倍。由于满足了需要，各地在自由市场开放以后，鸭的市价和牌价大体一致。许多农业社还加工出大批腊鸭来售卖。
    广东省鸭的数量是随着各地农业社注意发展副业生产而逐渐增加的。特别是在珠江三角洲，大部分农业社都利用当地沼溪交错的自然条件，饲养了数千只以至上万只鸭子。
