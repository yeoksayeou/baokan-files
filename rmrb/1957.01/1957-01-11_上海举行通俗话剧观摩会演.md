Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 9th: Many veteran popular drama performers in Shanghai, who have been away from the stage for two or three decades, are collaborating with young actors to bring back some traditional plays that were performed around the time of the Xinhai Revolution and the May Fourth Movement. Their performances in this area will be presented at the Shanghai Popular Drama and Shanghai Opera Performance and Exhibition that opened yesterday.

The exhibition is scheduled to last for thirteen consecutive days. More than seventy playwrights and drama workers from all over the country have come to observe it.

Both of these dramatic forms originated and developed in Shanghai. Popular drama (commonly known as "Civilized Drama") has been around for fifty years, starting with the establishment of the first troupe, the Spring Willow Society. According to several veteran artists, in the past, popular drama was able to quickly bring some major current events and social news to the stage because the actors had a high level of cultural knowledge and revolutionary thought and used a scenario system. The scenario system was equivalent to directors and actors collectively creating the script, only writing the outline of the plot and the scene details, assigning roles, and the lines were entirely up to the actors to freely develop based on their own genius. More than two thousand plays have been performed in the past fifty years.

Popular drama later gradually declined due to the dispersal of actors and various social reasons. Twenty years ago, the comedians in popular drama gradually developed from performing solo acts into a new form of drama—Shanghai opera, which is very popular among the masses.

The veteran artists are very excited about this performance and exhibition. They hope that through this exhibition, with the help of drama experts, they can study the reasons for the rise and fall of these two dramatic forms, summarize their strengths and weaknesses, and enable these two dramatic forms to develop better.

### 上海举行通俗话剧观摩会演

    上海举行通俗话剧观摩会演
    据新华社上海9日电　上海市许多脱离舞台生活二、三十年的通俗话剧老前辈，同青年演员合作，要把辛亥革命和“五四”运动前后上演过的一些传统剧目重新搬上舞台。昨天开幕的上海市通俗话剧、滑稽戏观摩会演中，将有他们的这方面的演出。
    这次会演准备连续举行十三天。全国各地的戏剧家和话剧工作者七十多人，特地前来观摩。
    这两个剧种都是在上海形成和发展的。通俗话剧（俗称“文明戏”）的形成从成立第一个剧团春柳社开始，已经有五十年。据几位老艺人谈，过去通俗话剧由于演员具有较高的文化知识和革命思想，运用了幕表制，能够迅速地把一些重大的时事动态和社会新闻搬上舞台。幕表制等于导演和演员集体创作剧本，只写出剧情的梗概和分场情节、分配角色，台词完全由演员凭自己的天才自由发挥。五十年来演出的剧目有两千多个。
    通俗话剧后来因为演员分散和各种社会原因逐渐走向衰落。二十年前通俗话剧中的滑稽演员从表演独脚戏逐渐发展成为一个新的剧种——滑稽戏，很受群众欢迎。
    老艺人们对这次会演感到非常兴奋，他们希望通过这次会演能在戏剧专家们的帮助下研究这两个剧种兴衰原因，总结它的特长和缺点，使这两个剧种得到更好的发展。
