Concerning the play "Under the Shanghai Eaves"
—A Short Note to the Audience
Jin Shan

Dear young friends:
Thank you for your concern about the performance of "Under the Shanghai Eaves." I am very grateful. You wrote to ask me what the theme of "Under the Shanghai Eaves" is. It doesn't seem like something that can be explained clearly in a few words. I think that when the curtain on the stage slowly rises, you will see a picture of life, the life of twenty years ago, the so-called human life of twenty years ago. These people suffered in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society that you are not familiar with. Some were moaning, some were sighing, some were mocking, some were crying, some were angry, some were resisting, and some, like green weeds growing out of stone cracks, were proudly stretching.

In the petty-bourgeois intellectuals, there are various weaknesses, such as timidity, hesitation, bewilderment, decadence, disappointment... These are the things that often cause them to fall into vulgar or even destructive paths. But when those who did not fall, or who fell and then got up again, stepped over or climbed over that long thorny road, and realized that one's existence is for the happiness of more people, they began to step into the door of true life.

At any time, you can see many angels in life, who can still radiate the light of youth even when they are in a dark place - that is, children.

I wrote the following in my director's notes:

"All oppression is encouragement, is the driving force for progress.
Let the old die, let the rusty scrap iron be returned to the furnace. Only new things are the most vivid, the most full of vitality, and the most poetic... The real protagonist in the play is the child, is the child!

The author of 'Under the Shanghai Eaves' not only accuses the cruel old society for the suffering of good people, but also shows these suffering people the beautiful future. The author's kindness permeates every good person, and the author's perseverance is deeply planted in the blood of the new life."

Dear young friends, when you see how the previous generation struggled in that society, wouldn't you be happy for your own happy life today?

Now the life on the stage is about to begin. I don't know if the many activities on the stage can reflect some of the themes of the work. I sincerely hope that you will write to us and tell us your thoughts after watching it. January 1957

    关于话剧“上海屋檐下”
    ——致观众的短笺
    金山亲爱的青年朋友们：
    承你们关心“上海屋檐下”的演出，我很感激。你们来信问我“上海屋檐下”的主题思想是什么。这好像不是一下子就能说清楚的事情。我想，当舞台上的帷幕徐徐展开时，你们就看见一幅生活的图景，这是二十年前的生活，二十年前的所谓人的生活。这些人在一个你们所不熟悉的半封建、半殖民地的社会中受尽熬煎，有的在呻吟，有的在叹息，有的在嘲讽，有的在哭泣，有的在愤怒，有的在反抗，有的却像石缝中钻出来的青绿的野草似的骄傲地伸展着。
    在小资产阶级出身的知识分子身上，存有各种弱点，譬如怯懦、犹豫、徬徨、颓废、失望……正是这些东西，常常使他们摔倒在庸俗甚或毁灭的道上。但是当那些没有摔倒或摔倒又爬起来的人，踏过或爬过了那段漫长的荆棘之路、领悟了一个人的生存是为了更多人的幸福的时候，他们就开始跨进了真正的生活之门。
    在任何时候都可以看到许许多多生活中的天使，他们即便置身在暗无天日的地方，仍然能够发散着青春的光芒——那就是孩子。
    我在我的导演手记中写过这样的话：
    “一切压迫就是鞭策，就是推向前进的动力。
    让陈旧的死亡，让生了锈的废铁回炉，世界上唯有新生的东西最鲜艳、最富有生命力，最为诗意……剧中真正的主人翁是孩子，是孩子！
    ‘上海屋檐下’的作者，不仅为着善良人的苦难而控诉残酷的旧社会，同时还向这些受苦的人昭示了未来的美好前程。作者的仁慈渗透在每一个善良人的身上，作者的坚毅深深栽植在新生命的血液之中。”
    亲爱的青年朋友们，当你们看到前一代人怎样在那个社会中挣扎的时候，难道不会为你们自己今天的幸福生活高兴吗？
    现在舞台上的那段生活就要开始，我不知道舞台上的许多活动能否体现一些作品的主题思想。我热诚地希望你们把观后的感想写信告诉我们。1957年1月
