Employee Family Cooperative
Lü Hanying

Yunnan Second Engineering Company has a high proportion of low-grade workers. The average wage of more than 60% of the workers is just over 40 yuan, and with the high local cost of living, there are many households with financial difficulties. Some workers are often affected in their production enthusiasm because problems such as food and housing for their families cannot be resolved.

In order to solve the difficulties of the employees' lives, the Party Committee and the Trade Union of the Second Engineering Company, based on the principle of family work serving production and serving the masses, and with the families of employees with financial difficulties as the backbone, established the Employee Family Cooperative in accordance with the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit. When it was first established, there were only 30 people, but it later expanded to 105 people, divided into seven groups: temporary workers, vegetable growing, pig raising, non-staple food, sewing, knitting, and laundry. The establishment of this organization was welcomed by the broad masses of employees in the local area; it gradually changed the mentality of the family members who believed "marrying a man is for clothing and food" and only complained about their husbands' low income when they had difficulties; it also reversed the thinking of many employees who said that "wives can't do anything" and looked down on women. Some employees' family members who had not joined the cooperative also began to feel a little embarrassed that they were wandering around all day, gathering together to gossip, not working, and not taking care of housework.

In the four months after its establishment, the family production cooperative had a total income of 3,789 yuan. After deducting the public accumulation fund and the cost of raw materials, the net surplus was 2,405 yuan. The income of the family members who joined the cooperative increased month by month. According to the statistics in August of last year: 54 people earned less than 10 yuan, 25 people earned between 10 and 20 yuan, and 9 people earned more than 20 yuan, with the highest income being 31 yuan. Among the eleven households in Shi Guixian's group, four households owed a total of 130 yuan the year before last, but only one household owed 20 yuan last year, and six households had savings of 155 yuan. The trade union's hardship subsidies also gradually decreased month by month.

Because the family members of employees participated in production, it reduced the family burden of the workers, and also improved the social and family status of the family members of employees, resulting in many new-style families who worked together, made progress together, and were united and harmonious. For example, Zhang Fengxiang's husband's monthly salary was 43 yuan. Because he had just come from his hometown and owed 60 yuan for settling down, coupled with the child's illness, the couple often quarreled. The family committee mediated many times without success; Zhang Fengxiang wanted to go out to work as a nanny, but her husband did not allow it. Later, she joined the cooperative, earning 12 yuan in the first month and 18 yuan in the second month, and was rated as a third-class family model in the company. The couple no longer quarreled. Li Taoxian, a family member of an employee, had a family of five, and before joining the cooperative, she constantly applied to the trade union for subsidies; after joining the cooperative, she earned 20 yuan a month, and not only did she not apply for subsidies, but the whole family made new clothes in addition to repaying debts.

The employee family cooperative is welcomed by the broad masses of employees, and it brings many conveniences to employees, especially single employees and employees whose families are not in the local area. In the past, it was very difficult to darn socks, sew clothes, and knit sweaters, but now they can all be sent to the sewing group of the family cooperative. In the past, no one specialized in selling breakfast, and in the early morning it was all the same porridge and steamed buns. After the family cooperative established the non-staple food group, there were many varieties such as pancakes, glutinous rice balls, dumplings, and steamed buns. The family cooperative also cooks meals for patients every day. All of these make the employees very satisfied.

    职工家属合作社
    吕含英
    云南第二工程公司低等级工人的比例很大，60％以上的工人平均工资是四十元多一点，加上当地生活水平较高，困难户比较多。有些工人往往因家属住食等问题不能解决而影响生产情绪。
    第二工程公司的党委会和工会为了解决职工生活的困难，根据家属工作为生产服务、为群众服务的方针，以生活有困难的职工家属为骨干，按照自愿互利的原则，成立了职工家属合作社。刚成立时只有三十人，后来扩大到一百零五人，分临时工、种菜、养猪、副食品、缝纫、针织、洗衣等七个组。这个组织的成立，得到当地广大职工的欢迎；逐步改变了家属中“嫁汉嫁汉穿衣吃饭”和有困难只埋怨丈夫收入少的情况；也扭转了不少职工说“婆娘样样都不会做”的轻视妇女的思想。有些未入社的职工家属，也开始觉得自己整天东游西逛，凑在一起说长道短，不工作，不搞好家务，有些不好意思了。
    家属生产合作社在成立后的四个月中，共收入三千七百八十九元。除掉公积金和原材料成本外，净余二千四百零五元。入社家属的收入逐月增加。根据去年8月份的统计：收入十元以下的五十四人，十元到二十元的二十五人，二十元以上的九人，最高的收入三十一元。石桂仙小组的十一户中，前年有四户欠账一百三十元，去年只有一户欠账二十元，有六户存款一百五十五元。工会的困难补助费也逐月渐少。
    由于职工家属参加了生产，减轻了工人的家庭负担，也提高了职工家属的社会地位和家庭地位，涌现了不少共同劳动，共同进步，团结和睦的新型家庭。例如张凤祥的丈夫每月工资四十三元，因他刚由家乡来，安家欠了六十元债，加上孩子有病，夫妇经常吵架，经家属委员调解多次无效；张凤祥要出去当保姆，丈夫不准。后来她参加了合作社，第一个月收入十二元，第二个月收入十八元，被评为公司的三等家属模范。夫妇间再也不吵架了。职工家属李桃仙全家五口，没有入社前不断向工会申请补助；入社后每月收入二十元，不但没有申请过补助，除了还账外，全家都做了新衣服。
    职工家属合作社受到广大职工的欢迎，给职工特别是单身职工和家属不在当地的职工，带来许多方便。过去托袜底、缝衣服、织毛衣很困难，现在都可以往家属合作社的缝纫组送。过去没人专卖早点，清早都是一色的稀饭馒头。家属合作社成立副食组后，大饼、汤元、水饺、包子等花样很多。家属合作社每天还代病人做饭。这些都使职工十分满意。
