Xinhua News Agency, January 20th – TASS reports: Soviet Communist Party and state leaders Molotov, Suslov, Brezhnev, and Aristov have in recent days, respectively, visited the Voronezh, Saratov, Omsk, and Chelyabinsk Oblasts of the Russian Federation, representing the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to award the Order of Lenin to these oblasts, in recognition of their significant achievements in reclaiming wasteland and developing agricultural production.

Molotov's Speech

Molotov said at the award ceremony in Voronezh Oblast on the 18th that the continuous growth of our country's economic strength and socialist culture has created conditions for further improving the welfare of our people and solving the existing difficulties in our daily lives. He said that in our relations with other countries, we follow the policy of consolidating peace and strengthening friendship between peoples. The Soviet Union advocates peace and strives to ease international tensions. At the same time, it remains vigilant against the conspiracies of imperialist countries.

Molotov spoke about the Middle East issue. He said that everyone sees that the positions of British and French colonialism in the Middle East have been greatly weakened, and American imperialism is trying to take advantage of the opportunity to seek its own interests, eager to seize new positions in this region rich in oil resources. Thus, the newly concocted Eisenhower-Dulles "Doctrine" has emerged. However, any new "doctrine" can only lead to the failure of those countries that attempt to replace the old form of colonialism with another in this region.

Molotov said that recent events clearly demonstrate the significance of the principles of revolutionary proletarian internationalism. These principles are the guiding principles of all socialist countries and are of particular significance for ensuring the freedom and national independence of these countries.

Molotov spoke about the Hungarian events. He emphasized that the attack by imperialism and the Horthy gang on the Hungarian people's democratic regime was met with a powerful counterattack from the countries of the socialist camp. This example shows how the strength of the socialist world system is growing and consolidating, and how great is the solidarity of the socialist world system and the ever-increasing significance of the great principles of proletarian internationalism when it is necessary to defend the fundamental interests of the working class and the working people, and to defend the interests of international socialism.

Molotov said that the formation of the "peace zone" proves that the positions of imperialism have weakened. Countries belonging to the "peace zone," such as India, Burma, Indonesia, Egypt, and Syria, which were still in a subordinate status yesterday, not only refuse to support the aggressive plans of imperialist countries, but also increasingly resolutely call for defending peace and strengthening friendship between the peoples of all countries. Of course, imperialist forces are still trying to control these countries, and are constantly adopting new means to attempt to make the development of these countries conform to their selfish interests. However, socialist countries are very concerned about the needs of the people of these countries, and are actively providing possible support for the struggle of the people of these countries for national freedom and independence. This cannot but gain greater and greater understanding from the people of these countries. All this strengthens the forces of defending peace and is conducive to ensuring and developing normal relations between the peoples of all countries.

Suslov's Speech

Suslov said at a mass meeting in Saratov on the 16th that the Soviet Union has become a strong country due to its great achievements in the development of industry and agriculture. The Soviet Union plays a major role in resolving various international issues. The growing power of the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp, as well as the peace-loving policies of these countries, are a reliable guarantee for consolidating the security of the people and world peace, and have a huge impact on the heroic and victorious struggle of the colonial peoples for their national independence and complete liberation from the oppression of imperialism. After talking about the new conspiracy of American imperialism to replace the colonial positions of Britain and France in the Middle East, Suslov said that as for the people of socialist countries and all peace-loving people, they have drawn a natural conclusion from the fact that the actions of imperialist aggressors have sharpened the international situation to a certain extent: it is necessary to be vigilant, strengthen the people's struggle for lasting peace, further consolidate the fraternal ties between Communist or Workers' Parties, and strengthen the great cooperation of socialist countries to ensure the complete victory of the cause of peace and socialism.

Brezhnev's Speech

Brezhnev spoke at a mass meeting in Omsk on the 19th. He pointed out the achievements of the Soviet people in improving agricultural production and reclaiming wasteland. He said that the Soviet Union has reclaimed 35.5 million hectares of land in three years. Its sown area exceeds the total sown area of grain in nine European countries: France, Italy, West Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden. Brezhnev emphasized that the Soviet Union is a powerful fortress of peace, we firmly oppose any military adventure, and we do not need the territory of others. We have everything we need to advance along the socialist road.

Aristov's Speech

Aristov spoke at the award ceremony in Chelyabinsk on the 18th. When talking about the task of improving the Soviet Union's plan for developing the national economy, he emphasized that the achievements of Soviet economic construction directly affect the international situation. He said that imperialist forces are doing everything possible to complicate the international situation and inflict losses on the socialist camp. However, the forces of peace and socialism are not sleeping. The Soviet Union is closely united with powerful China and the people's democratic countries, and with all progressive forces in capitalist countries, to jointly and vigilantly defend peace. Therefore, at present, it is particularly important to do everything possible to develop the Soviet Union's economy, strengthen its strength, and produce more grain, meat, milk, wool, and other agricultural products for the country.

    俄罗斯联邦四个州荣获列宁勋章
    莫洛托夫等代表苏联最高苏维埃主席团授勋
    据新华社20日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联共产党和国家的领导人莫洛托夫、苏斯洛夫、勃列日涅夫和阿里斯托夫最近几天分别到俄罗斯联邦的沃罗涅日、萨拉托夫、鄂木斯克和车里雅宾斯克州，代表苏联最高苏维埃主席团把列宁勋章授给这些州，以奖励它们在开垦荒地和发展农业生产方面所取得的重大成就。
    莫洛托夫的讲话
    莫洛托夫18日在沃罗?日州的授勋大会上说，我国的经济实力和社会主义文化的不断增长，为进一步提高我们人民的福利和解决我们日常生活上现存的困难问题创造了条件。他说，在我们和其他国家的关系中，我们遵循着巩固和平和巩固人民间的友谊的方针。苏联拥护和平并且力求缓和国际紧张局势。同时，它也对帝国主义国家的阴谋保持着警惕。
  莫洛托夫谈到了中东问题。他说，大家看到，现在英法殖民主义在中近东的阵地已经大大削弱了，美国帝国主义正竭力趁机为自己谋利，急于打算在这块蕴藏着丰富石油资源的地区夺取新的阵地。于是就出现了新泡制的艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯“主义”。但是，任何新的“主义”只能给那些图谋在这个地区以另一种殖民主义形式代替旧形式的国家以失败。
    莫洛托夫说，最近的事实明显地表明了革命的无产阶级国际主义原则的意义。这些原则是所有社会主义国家的指导方针，对保障这些国家的自由和民族独立具有特殊的意义。
    莫洛托夫谈到了匈牙利事件。他强调指出，帝国主义和霍尔蒂匪帮对匈牙利人民民主政权的进攻，遭到了社会主义阵营国家强有力的反击。从这个例子可以看出，社会主义世界体系的力量是如何壮大和巩固，当需要保卫工人阶级和劳动人民的根本利益、保卫国际社会主义的利益的时候，社会主义世界体系的团结和伟大的、无产阶级国际主义原则的日益增长的意义是如何巨大。
    莫洛托夫说，“和平地区”的形成证明了帝国主义的阵地削弱了。属于“和平地区”的昨天还处于附属国地位的印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、埃及、叙利亚等国，不仅拒绝支持帝国主义国家的侵略计划，而且愈来愈坚决地呼吁保卫和平、加强各国人民之间的友谊。当然，帝国主义势力仍然企图控制这些国家，并且不断采用新的手段企图使这些国家的发展符合它们的自私利益，然而，社会主义国家对这些国家的人民的需要却非常关心，并且在行动上对这些国家的人民争取民族自由和独立的斗争正在给予可能的支持。这不能不获得这些国家的人民越来越大的理解。这一切都加强了保卫和平的力量，也有利于保证和发展各国人民之间的正常关系。
    苏斯洛夫的讲话
    苏斯洛夫16日在萨拉托夫举行的群众大会上讲话时说，由于在发展工业和农业方面获得了巨大成就，苏联已经成为一个强盛的国家。在解决各种国际问题中苏联起着重大的作用。苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家的日益增长的威力以及这些国家的爱好和平的政策是巩固人民的安全和世界和平的可靠保证，并且对殖民地各国人民为他们的民族独立和完全从帝国主义的压迫之下解放出来而进行的英勇的胜利斗争，起着巨大影响。苏斯洛夫在谈到美国帝国主义企图取代英法在中近东的殖民地位的新阴谋后说，至于社会主义国家的人民和所有爱好和平的人民，他们从帝国主义侵略者的行为使国际局势在一定程度上尖锐起来的事实中作出了当然的结论：必须提高警惕，加强人民争取持久和平的斗争，进一步巩固共产党或工人党之间的兄弟联系，加强社会主义国家的伟大合作以使和平和社会主义的事业取得彻底的胜利。
    勃列日?夫的讲话
    勃列日?夫19日在鄂木斯克举行的群众大会上讲话。他指出了苏联人民在提高农业生产、开垦荒地方面的成就。他说，苏联在三年期间开垦了三千五百五十万公顷的土地。它的播种面积超过法国、意大利、西德、奥地利、比利时、丹麦、荷兰、西班牙和瑞典九个欧洲国家谷物播种面积的总和。勃列日?夫强调说，苏联是和平力量的强大堡垒，我们坚决反对任何军事冒险，我们不需要别人的领土。我们有沿着社会主义道路前进所需要的一切东西。
    阿里斯托夫的讲话
    阿里斯托夫18日在车里雅宾斯克举行的授勋大会上讲了话。他在谈到改善苏联发展国民经济计划的任务的时候着重指出，苏联经济建设的成就直接影响国际局势。他说，帝国主义势力千方百计地力图使国际局势复杂化，使社会主义阵营遭到损失。但是，和平和社会主义力量并没有睡觉，苏联同强大的中国和各人民民主国家，同资本主义国家的一切进步力量紧紧团结在一起，共同机警地捍卫着和平。因此，在目前，尽力发展苏联的经济、加强它的实力、给国家生产更多的粮食、肉类、牛奶、羊毛和其他农产品，是特别重要的。
