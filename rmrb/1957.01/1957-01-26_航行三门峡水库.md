　　Sailing the Sanmenxia Reservoir
　　Cheng Xinhua

　　The winter sun, shining through layers of mist, illuminated the earth. We boarded the plane for aerial photography over Sanmenxia, heading towards Tongguan in the face of the rising sun.

　　This was an aircraft equipped with an automatic camera in the middle of the cabin. The Russian letters below the large characters "Civil Aviation of China" on the wings were still faintly visible. Back in 1954, Soviet experts helped China train its first aerial photogrammetry team in Hailar and Qiqihar, Inner Mongolia. Once these young navigators and photographers were able to work independently, the Soviet friends gave the aerial surveying aircraft to China, allowing their personally trained apprentices to continue operating these aircraft to conduct aerial surveys of rivers, terrains, and forest resources for China's socialist construction.

　　This was the final flight to photograph the 1:25,000 scale topographic map of the Sanmenxia Reservoir area. The aircraft proceeded at a normal speed, the neat fields and checkerboard villages of the suburbs of Xi'an and neighboring counties flying swiftly beneath the wings; the Longhai Railway stretched westward like two thin black lines; Mount Hua, the West Great Mountain, appearing on the right wing of the aircraft, resembled a range of hills floating in the clouds and mist; soon, the winding Yellow River also appeared faintly in the front right of the aircraft. At this time, a tense atmosphere suddenly filled the cockpit; the young navigator, Ning Shijie, began searching for ground targets through the course viewfinder. The captain and co-pilot, fully focused, constantly twisted this or that switch, and the aircraft tilted its body in a sharp turn. In the cabin, the photographer, Wang Xiangjun, already wearing headphones, sat next to the camera, probing the changes in wind direction with a long mirror, and promptly reported the changes in wind direction to the navigator via the microphone. After a period of rapid maneuvering, the aircraft flew steadily and accurately along the selected photographic course, and Wang Xiangjun, right on time according to the command from the cockpit, flipped the switch, and the automatic camera began to work with a "dada" sound. Under the close coordination of the navigator, captain, and photographer, the aircraft, like an obedient eagle, constantly circled over the Yellow River in a regular pattern. This was a very difficult technical flight. Because the aircraft was at an altitude of more than 2,800 meters, taking topographic photographs at a speed of four kilometers per minute, and each photograph had to ensure a certain proportion of overlap on the left, right, front, and back, with no room for carelessness. At this time, whether it was the navigator or the photographer, even a second's negligence would cause a significant deviation in the aircraft's course, resulting in irreparable losses to the work.

　　The aircraft continued to fly, and the camera worked rhythmically.

　　I sat quietly in the cabin, watching these capable young people working so skillfully; at the same time, I looked down at the boundless Loess Plateau, eroded into thousands of gullies, below the aircraft. I immediately thought of the parched and cracked land, which would be the bottom of the future Sanmenxia Reservoir. At this moment, I seemed to see huge ships sailing smoothly on the vast lake surface; white buildings of sanatoriums scattered along the green lakeside; flocks of fishing boats with white sails contrasting with the verdant mountains and lake scenery; on the distant horizon, tractors were working in the vast fields; the tall chimneys of factories were hidden in the misty landscape of the lake. These young people currently working on the aerial survey aircraft are concentrating on their work for such a beautiful cause, to transform the face of the motherland's nature, so that the land of fish and rice of Jiangnan can appear on the arid Loess Plateau.

　　At this moment, Liu Keqin, a tall photographer who was not yet working, walked over to my side with a map and explained the progress of the aerial surveying work. He told me that the aircraft could photograph the topography of more than 20,000 hectares of land in one hour. The characteristics of aerial photogrammetry are that it is fast, inexpensive, and provides technical data that is authentic and reliable. I learned from the head of the aerial surveying team that in a month, this group of people had completed aerial photography work covering an area of 9,000 square kilometers around the Sanmenxia Reservoir area, stretching from Sanmenxia in the east to Xianyang in the west, Huxian in the south, and Hejin County, where the Yellow River and Fen River meet, in the north. Most of the photographed 1:25,000 scale topographic maps have been sent to the relevant design departments of the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau. Based on the topographic photographs, they can find control points and draw accurate topographic maps of the Sanmenxia Reservoir area within a few months. Such a large-scale project as the Sanmenxia Water Control Project, a rare undertaking in the world, requires surveying a topographic map of such a large area. If relying solely on ground surveying, it would be necessary to mobilize several large surveying teams and spend a considerable amount of time to survey and map it section by section. However, aerial photogrammetry can, in a short period of time, present the complete and authentic appearance of the rivers and terrain of an area of 9,000 square kilometers on the design tables of engineers, allowing them to carefully consider, as if overlooking this vast area of land, where to build the most economical and suitable railway branch lines, where to cultivate protective forests for the dikes, where to erect the towers for high-voltage transmission lines, and where to build a series of new factories....

　　It was almost one o'clock in the afternoon when the cheerful face of the navigator Ning Shijie appeared at the door of the cockpit. He told us with a smile, "We are about to fly over Sanmenxia." Liu Keqin, sitting next to me, immediately stood up and walked to the camera to replace Wang Xiangjun's work. After a while, Sanmenxia appeared in the front right of the aircraft. Looking down at this jewel of the Yellow River, a magnificent picture appeared again in my mind. In the near future, a dam as high as a mountain will stand here, and high-voltage transmission lines like spider webs will stretch from here to Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Xi'an, and to the vast countryside. The six billion kilowatt-hours of cheap electricity generated here every year will turn several cities and towns in Shaanxi, Henan, and Shanxi provinces into cities that never sleep, lined with factories.... Suddenly, I felt like I had fallen straight down from high altitude. At this time, the aircraft had dived from an altitude of more than 2,800 meters to more than 1,300 meters above the ground; the fuselage tilted, making a sharp turn, and the shadow of the sun constantly shook on the wings; the aircraft circled over Sanmenxia like a fishing boat in a stormy sea; the automatic camera was working again with a "dada" sound. At this time, I felt dizzy and palpitations because I had been continuously shaken by the flight for several hours, and I felt very uncomfortable. However, the navigator Gu Zhenfan and the photographer Liu Keqin were still working with great concentration.

    航行三门峡水库
    程馨华
    冬天的朝阳，透过层层薄雾照射着大地，我们坐上去三门峡上空进行航空摄影的飞机，迎着朝阳往潼关方向飞去。
    这是一架在座舱的中部装有自动摄影机的飞机。机翼上“中国民航”几个大字下面的俄文字母还隐约可见。还是在1954年，苏联专家在内蒙古的海拉尔和齐齐哈尔帮助我国培养了这第一支航空摄影测量队；等到这几个年青的领航员和摄影员能够独立工作以后，苏联朋友们就把航测飞机送给了我国，让他们亲手培养出来的徒弟们继续操纵这些飞机，为我国的社会主义建设航测河川、地形和森林资源。
    这是拍摄三门峡水库区周围两万五千分之一的地形照片的最后一次飞行。飞机按照正常的速度前进，西安市郊和邻近各县整齐的田畴和棋布的村庄飞快地从机翼下面掠过；陇海铁路像两条黑色的细线往西逶迤而去；出现在飞机右翼下的西岳华山，恰似浮沉在云雾中的一片丘陵；不久，蜿蜒的黄河也在飞机右前方隐隐出现了。这时，驾驶室里突然呈现着紧张的气氛；年青的领航员宁世杰透过航线瞄准器开始在寻找地面的目标。机长和副驾驶全神贯注地不断扭动这个或那个开关，飞机倾斜着身子来了个急转弯。在座舱里，摄影员王相俊已经戴上耳机坐在摄影机旁边的座位上，在用长形的镜子探测风向的变化，并及时地通过送话器把风向的变化情况报告给领航员。飞机急速地扭动了一阵，就准确地按照选定的摄影航线稳稳地飞行，而王相俊已经准时地按照驾驶座舱里传来的命令、拧开了电钮，自动摄影机就开始哒哒地工作起来。飞机在领航员、机长和摄影员的紧密配合操纵下，就像一只听命令的苍鹰一样，在黄河上空不断地绕着有规则的圈子。这是一种非常困难的技术飞行。因为飞机在两千八百多公尺的高空，以每分钟四公里的速度来拍摄地形照片，而且每张照片的左、右、前、后都必须保证有一定比例的重叠，丝毫马虎不得。这时候，不管是领航员或者是摄影员，只要稍有一秒钟的疏忽，飞机的航线就会发生很大的偏差，以至造成工作上不可弥补的损失。
    飞机继续飞行着，摄影机也在有节奏地工作着。
    我安静地坐在机舱里，一面看着这几个能干的年青人在那么娴熟地进行工作；一面又俯视着飞机下面那一望无际的、被冲刷得千沟万壑的黄土高原。我立即联想到那干涸开裂的土地，就是未来的三门峡水库的湖底。这时我好像看见了在浩瀚的湖面正有巨大的轮船在平稳地航行；在绿荫环绕的湖岸边散布着一座座疗养院的白色楼房；成群的渔船的白帆衬托在青翠的山峦和湖光之间；在远处地平线上，拖拉机正在辽阔的田野上耕作；工厂的高大烟囱隐现在湖光山色的雾霭之中。现在正在航测飞机上工作的这些年青人，正是为了这样美好的事业，为了改造祖国大自然的面貌，使江南的鱼米之乡在干旱的黄土高原出现，而全神贯注地工作着。
    这时尚未开始工作的高个子摄影员刘克勤拿着一本地图走近我的身边，向我解释航测工作的进展情况。他告诉我：飞机在一小时内就可以拍摄两万多公顷土地的地形照片。航空摄影测量的特点就是速度快、花费少，提供的技术资料真实可靠。我从航测队的负责人那里了解到在一个月的时间里，他们这一小组人已经完成了三门峡水库区周围东起三门峡、西到咸阳、南起鄠县、北到黄河与汾水交界的河津县，面积达九千平方公里的航空摄影工作。拍摄好的二万五千分之一的地形照片，大部分已经送到了三门峡工程局的有关设计部门。他们根据地形照片，找好控制点，就可以在几个月之内描绘出准确的三门峡水库区的地形图。三门峡水利枢纽这样一个世界罕有的大工程，测绘这样大面积的地形图，如果光靠地面测量，至少得动员几个庞大的测量队，花相当长的时间，才能够分区分块地测绘出来。而航空摄影测量却能在短短的时间内，把九千平方公里面积的河川地形面貌，完整地真实地摆在工程师们的设计桌上，让他们像俯视着这一大片土地似的，来周密地考虑在那里修筑起最经济合用的铁路专用线，在那里培育起护堤的防护林带，在那里竖立高压输电线的铁塔，在那里兴建一系列的新型工厂……。
    时间快到下午一点钟，在驾驶室门口出现了领航员宁世杰愉快的面孔，他笑嘻嘻地告诉我们：“就要飞到三门峡上空去了。”坐在旁边的刘克勤马上站起身来，走到摄影机旁边去接替王相俊的工作。一会儿，三门峡就在飞机的右前方出现了。俯视着这块黄河的瑰宝，在我的脑海里又出现了一幅壮丽的图景。在不久的将来，这里就要矗立起像高山一样的大坝，像蛛网一样的高压输电线就会从这里伸向郑州、洛阳、西安，伸向广大的农村。每年从这里发出的六十亿度廉价的电力，会使陕西、河南、山西等省的若干城镇，变成工厂林立的不夜之城……。猛然一下，我觉得人像从高空直摔下来似的。这时，飞机已从两千八百多公尺的高空俯冲下降到离地面一千三百多公尺；机身倾斜着，来了个急转弯，太阳的影子在机翼上不断地摇晃；飞机就像狂涛中的渔船，在三门峡上空绕着圈子；自动摄影机又在哒哒地工作了。这时候，我因为连续受了几小时的飞行的颠簸，已感到头昏心悸，很不舒服。而领航员顾镇藩和摄影员刘克勤却还在聚精会神地工作着。
