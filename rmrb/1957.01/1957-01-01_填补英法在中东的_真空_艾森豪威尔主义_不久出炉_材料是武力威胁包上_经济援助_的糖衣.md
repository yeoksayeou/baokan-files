Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch: United Press reporter Gonzalez reported from Washington on the 29th that a "senior official" of the U.S. government "authorized to speak" revealed that the United States will soon announce a plan called the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The purpose of this plan is "to use American military and economic power to fill the power vacuum in the Middle East caused by the disappearance of British and French influence after the Suez offensive."

It is revealed that this "Eisenhower Doctrine," which is said to be comparable to the "Monroe Doctrine" of 1823 and the "Truman Doctrine" of 1947 "in scope and intent," although its "details" are still "being drafted," is expected to include two "main characteristics": First, it flies the banner of "not allowing (Soviet) interference" in the Middle East and poses with a "posture that the United States is prepared to fight if necessary"; second, it wears a generous face, using a five-billion-dollar "economic aid" plan to "draw the relations between Middle Eastern countries and the West closer."

The news reveals that the reason the United States wants to take such diplomatic policy measures is that it believes that it is difficult to achieve the goal of monopolizing the entire Middle East by merely using the United Nations to promote its policy in the Middle East without directly "taking action." In this regard, the news specifically mentioned countries such as Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, where the national independence movement is rising and a policy of peace and neutrality is adopted.

    填补英法在中东的“真空”
    “艾森豪威尔主义”不久出炉
    材料是武力威胁包上“经济援助”的糖衣
    据新华社31日讯　合众社记者冈萨雷斯29日从华盛顿报道，一个“有权发言”的美国政府“高级官员”透露，美国不久就要宣布一项叫作“艾森豪威尔主义”的计划。这个计划的目的，是“要用美国的军事和经济力量，填补英法在进攻苏伊士以后由于影响的消逝而在中东造成的势力真空”。
    据透露，这个据说是“在范围和意图方面”都可以同1823年的
  “门罗主义”和1947年的“杜鲁门主义”相比拟的“艾森豪威尔主义”，其“细节”虽然还“正在拟定之中”，但是预料它将包括两个“主要的特点”：第一，它在中东打着“不许
  （苏联）干涉”的招牌，并且摆出
  “必要时美国准备作战”的姿态；第二，它带着一付慷慨的面孔，以五亿美元的“经济援助”计划把
  “中东各国同西方的关系拉得更密切一些”。
    消息透露，美国所以要采取这样的外交政策措施，是因为它想，仅仅利用联合国来推行它在中东的政策，而不直接“采取行动”，就很难达到垄断整个中东的目的。在这方面，消息特别提到民族独立运动高涨和采取和平中立政策的埃及、叙利亚和约旦等国。
