    Xinhua News Agency, 7th - China successfully trial-produced two types of heavy-duty machine tools and four types of high-precision machine tools that it had historically been unable to manufacture in 1956. In 1956, China's machine-building industry successfully trial-produced a total of seventy-five new types of machine tools, creating favorable conditions for the production of large and precision machinery and equipment for various sectors of the national economy in the future.
    Among the large and heavy-duty machine tools successfully trial-produced in 1956, one is a gantry planer weighing sixty-seven tons, equipped with fifteen electric motors with a total capacity of 140 kilowatts. It can process large steel parts weighing twenty tons, with a width of two meters, a height of one and a half meters, and a length of seven meters. It is an indispensable machine tool for manufacturing large machinery and equipment. In the past, the largest gantry planer manufactured in China weighed thirty-eight tons and could only process steel parts weighing ten tons, with a width of one and a half meters, a height of one point two five meters, and a length of four meters. Another steel ingot cutting machine weighing fifty-two tons, successfully trial-produced in 1956, has eight tool rests in the front and rear, which can cut steel ingots into the required number of sections at once. It is also equipped with a DC motor and can automatically change speed during operation, resulting in high production efficiency. It is a special equipment for cutting polygonal steel ingots in the iron and steel industry.
    Among the high-precision machine tools successfully trial-produced by China's machine-building industry in 1956, there is a grinder used to process precision tools and other precision parts. The precision of the workpieces it processes can reach one-tenth of a silk (a unit of measurement), while the diameter of a normal human hair is about seven silks. There is also a universal tool milling machine weighing more than one ton, which can process workpieces with a precision of one-half of a silk. Machine tool, automobile manufacturing, measuring tool and cutting tool manufacturing, and other machine factories all need this type of machine tool. It is the first time that such a high-precision machine tool has been successfully trial-produced in China. In the past, the highest precision of the machine tools manufactured was only one silk.
    In 1956, China's machine-building industry also successfully trial-produced nine types of automatic and semi-automatic machine tools. Among them, four automated machine tools, can produce machine parts simply by loading the materials and pressing a button. They have very high work efficiency, and one worker can operate several at the same time, which is of great significance to the manufacturing departments of automobiles, tractors, and other mass-produced products. The two semi-automatic grinders successfully trial-produced in 1956 are equipped with automatic measuring equipment, which can automatically inspect the workpiece during processing. If the precision of the workpiece does not meet the requirements, the grinder will automatically restart until the requirements are met. Because the automatic measuring device can replace workers for inspection, the grinder has high efficiency, and the quality of the processed products is also very high.
    From 1953 to 1956, China's machine-building industry successfully trial-produced a total of one hundred and fifty-eight important new types of machine tools, overfulfilling the plan for trial-producing machine tools during the First Five-Year Plan period.

    为生产大型和精密机器设备创造有利条件
    去年试制成功七十五种新工作母机
    新华社7日讯　中国历史上不能制造的两种重型工作母机和四种高精度的工作母机在1956年试制成功。1956年中国机器制造工业试制成功的新型工作母机共有七十五种，为今后给国民经济各部门生产大型和精密的机器设备创造了有利条件。
    1956年试制成功的大型和重型工作母机中，有一种重达六十七吨的龙门刨床，它装有总容量一百四十瓩的十五个电动机。它可以加工宽二公尺、高一公尺五、长七公尺的重达二十吨的大型钢铁部件，是制造大型机器设备不可缺少的一种机床。过去中国制造的最大的龙门刨床重量是三十八吨，只能加工宽一公尺五、高一点二五公尺、长四公尺的重达十吨的钢铁部件。1956年试制成功的另一种重达五十二吨的钢锭切断机，它前后有八个刀架，可以一次将钢锭切成所需要的段数，并装有直流电机，在工作中可以自动变换速度，生产效率很高，是钢铁工业部门切断多角型钢锭的专用设备。
    中国机器制造工业1956年试制成功的高精度的工作母机中，有一种用于加工精密工具和其他精密零件的磨床，它加工的工作物的精度可以达到十分之一丝，而一般头发的直径是七丝左右。还有一种重达一吨多的万能工具铣床，它加工的工作物的精度可以达到二分之一丝。机床、汽车制造、量具刃具制造和其他机器厂都需要这种工作母机。这样高精度的工作母机在中国还是第一次试制成功，过去制造的工作母机的最高精度也仅达到了一丝。
    1956年中国机器制造工业还试制成功了九种自动和半自动的工作母机，其中四种自动化的工作母机，只要装好料，按按电钮，就可以制造出机器零件来，工作效率很高，一个工人可以同时操纵好几台，对于汽车、拖拉机等大量生产的制造部门有很大意义。1956年试制成功的两种半自动的磨床，装有自动测量设备，可以在加工过程中自动对工作物进行检查，如果工作物的精度没有达到要求，这种磨床就重新自动工作起来，直到达到要求为止。由于自动测量装置可以代替工人进行检查，磨床有很高的效率，加工的产品质量也很高。
    从1953年起到1956年为止，中国机器制造工业试制成功的重要的新型的工作母机共有一百五十八种，超额完成了第一个五年计划期间试制工作母机的计划。
