Industrial and Commercial People Must Continue to Promote Patriotism
Rong Yiren, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce

At the end of last year, before the National Congress of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, I once again heard Chairman Mao's kind teachings, which greatly encouraged me and made me see more clearly the direction of my future efforts. I am even more confident in my future work. I believe that our industrialists and businessmen must continue to promote the spirit of patriotism and better serve the socialist construction of the motherland.

China's national bourgeoisie loves the motherland. However, it is undeniable that we once fantasized about realizing our patriotic aspirations by establishing a capitalist country. Of course, this was not possible. Under the leadership and education of the Communist Party of China and the working class, we realized that only by taking the socialist road can we realize our patriotic aspirations. Therefore, China's national bourgeoisie embarked on the road of loving the country and loving socialism. The joyful entry of industrialists and businessmen into joint state-private ownership on January 20 last year was a concrete manifestation of this. However, how to continue to promote the spirit of patriotism in the future is still an issue that we should pay great attention to.

The national bourgeoisie is a class with two sides. Although, in recent years, especially after the joint state-private ownership of all trades, the positive side has been continuously increasing and the negative side has been gradually shrinking, the two sides still exist. The main manifestation of the negative side is only caring about individual interests and not caring about overall interests. The negative side can be exposed at any time. Some of us tend to put personal interests first when considering issues, and even only see personal interests. This is an ideological style that is not conducive to the country, the people, and ourselves. If the interests of the country are not guaranteed, personal interests cannot be obtained. Even if they are obtained temporarily, they will definitely not be able to be maintained in the end. For example, in capitalist society, capitalists compete with each other for personal gain, and "big fish eat small fish." As a result of the competition, some "big fish" will eventually fail. For another example, some national capitalists in China, in order to pursue their personal interests, did not hesitate to become attached to imperialists, but as a result, they could not avoid being eaten by imperialism. History has given us painful lessons. We do not completely deny personal interests, but when considering personal interests, we must combine personal interests with the interests of the country, so that personal interests are subordinate to the interests of the country.

Only with a correct understanding of the relationship between national interests and personal interests is it possible to distinguish right from wrong. The development of things is very complicated. If we do not use the correct standpoints and viewpoints to understand things, it is often difficult to distinguish right from wrong. Industrialists and businessmen are accustomed to looking at problems from the perspective of personal interests, believing that what is beneficial to me is "right" and what is not beneficial is "wrong." In this way, it is easy to blur right and wrong, lose direction, and is very detrimental to the country and personal transformation. In fact, right and wrong are easy to distinguish. The problem is not to start only from personal interests and departmental interests, but must start from overall interests and comprehensively analyze problems. For example, in the relationship between public and private cooperation, if we only start from personal interests, then whenever our own opinions are not adopted by the public sector or employees, we will complain about the public sector and employees, and believe that the poor relationship between public and private cooperation is the responsibility of the public sector and employees, which hinders the improvement of the relationship between public and private cooperation. If we start from overall interests and comprehensively analyze problems, we will realize that our own opinions may not be flawless, and we will humbly listen to and adopt the opinions of the public sector and employees. We will realize that it is the responsibility of both parties to improve the relationship between public and private cooperation, and we will also actively work to improve the relationship. As a result, the relationship between public and private cooperation can be improved. For another example, with the development of our country's construction cause, there will be a tense situation in the supply of raw materials. If we only start from the interests of our own department, then we will complain that the government does not supply raw materials and wait passively. If we start from overall interests and comprehensively analyze problems, we will realize that this is a difficulty in the process of national construction, and everyone has a responsibility to overcome it. In practical actions, we will also strive to take measures such as saving raw materials and using substitutes. Different starting points will lead to different results. The line between right and wrong is very clear: what is beneficial to socialism is "right," and what is not beneficial to socialism is "wrong."

To distinguish right from wrong, in addition to looking at problems from the perspective of overall interests and comprehensively analyzing them, we also need to learn to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. Over the past seven years, through many facts, I believe that criticism and self-criticism are good methods for resolving internal contradictions among the people. We must be brave in criticizing and even more brave in self-criticism. In this way, we can make right and wrong clearer and clearer, and make the country's construction cause and our personal transformation continue to move forward. However, only by firmly starting from the overall interests can we no longer be preoccupied with personal gains and losses and dare to launch criticism and self-criticism. At the same time, only by launching criticism and self-criticism can we constantly overcome the old habit of being preoccupied with personal interests and firmly stand on the side of overall interests.

Not only must we distinguish right from wrong, but we should also distinguish between ourselves and the enemy. Our country is not isolated, but has a close relationship with the entire world situation. Today's entire world situation is: socialism has gone beyond the scope of one country and become a world system. This historical process is unstoppable by capitalism; while capitalism is developing in the opposite direction, becoming increasingly decadent. To this end, imperialists are doing everything possible to undermine socialism in order to save its dying fate. However, the imperialists are doomed to fail. This is the very obvious situation before us. Industrialists and businessmen who have suffered from long-term oppression by imperialism understand this even more deeply. However, when the international situation develops to be more complicated and the international reactionary forces recklessly launch frenzied attacks on socialism, some people in the industrial and commercial circles become confused, unable to see the aggressive nature of imperialism, and their confidence in the socialist cause wavers to some extent, while they harbor certain illusions about imperialism. When imperialists use the sweet words of "aid" to disguise their aggressive nature, some industrialists and businessmen have easily believed them, equating this "aid" with the Soviet Union's sincere and selfless assistance to our country. In fact, the purpose of imperialism's so-called "aid" is to invade. The Soviet Union's aid to our country is to help our country's economic and cultural construction and to seek a happy life for our people. Therefore, only by strengthening our unity with the Soviet Union and all people's democratic countries can we guarantee our happiness and make the socialist cause continue to develop. We love our country, not only the socialist motherland, but also all socialist countries. We must distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, crush all the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism, and strengthen the close unity between socialist countries.

Therefore, while promoting the spirit of patriotism, we should also pay attention to promoting the spirit of internationalism. Our national capitalists are patriotic; however, our patriotic enthusiasm in the past was based on the demand for national independence and autonomy. Precisely because of this, it is easy for us to generate narrow nationalist views. Narrow nationalism is a bourgeois view. As bourgeois elements, it is natural for us to have this concept. However, narrow nationalism is detrimental to strengthening the unity of socialist countries and the unity of progressive people all over the world. Since we love our country and love socialism, and are willing to work for the common cause of mankind—the socialist cause—then we should be vigilant and overcome this narrow nationalism, learn from the working class, and promote the spirit of internationalism.

Uniting patriotism and love for socialism, learning and promoting the spirit of internationalism, has a great encouraging effect on us personally. Because only in this way can we deeply understand that our efforts are closely related to the common cause of all mankind and contribute our positive forces.

In the final analysis, the key to the above lies in having a correct standpoint. Without a correct standpoint, it is impossible to distinguish right from wrong or to distinguish between ourselves and the enemy; and promoting the spirit of patriotism and internationalism becomes empty talk. Some people in the industrial and commercial circles believe that problems can be discussed without regard to standpoint, and even fear talking about standpoint, believing that once a standpoint is mentioned, it is impossible to engage in free debate and exert free thought. This view is wrong. No one is without his own standpoint. Without a standpoint, it is impossible to understand problems or analyze things. The so-called setting aside a standpoint is actually having another standpoint; it is impossible to truly set aside a standpoint. For example, we love democracy and freedom. If we only start from ourselves and demand unlimited democracy and freedom, the result will inevitably harm the democracy and freedom of others, undermine the democratic order of the country, and pave the way for the enemy's sabotage conspiracies. Therefore, we must firmly stand on the side of the people, on the side of socialism, love our country, love socialism, and promote the spirit of patriotism and internationalism.

Since liberation, the industrial and commercial circles have made great progress. This is the result of the Chinese Communist Party's unity and education of us, and also the result of our own efforts to transform ourselves under the leadership of the Party. The Chinese Communist Party is armed with Marxism-Leninism, and it treats all problems with the Marxist-Leninist standpoint and viewpoint. Only under the leadership and education of the Communist Party can industrialists and businessmen gradually change their bourgeois standpoints and viewpoints and learn and establish the standpoints and viewpoints of the working class. We must resolutely accept the leadership of the Party and the leadership of the working class, combine personal interests with national interests, distinguish right from wrong, distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, continue to promote the spirit of patriotism and internationalism, be full of confidence, contribute our strength, and move forward on the bright socialist road of the motherland.

    工商业者必须继续发扬爱国主义精神
    中华全国工商业联合会副主任委员　荣毅仁
    去年年底，在全国工商联会员代表大会召开前夕，我又一次听到了毛主席的亲切教诲，得到很大的鼓励，更明确地看到了今后努力的方向，我对今后的工作更加有了信心，我认为，我们工商业者必须继续发扬爱国主义精神，更好地为祖国的社会主义建设服务。
    中国的民族资产阶级是热爱祖国的。但是，无庸讳言，我们曾经幻想通过建立一个资本主义国家来实现自己爱国的愿望。当然，这是不能实现的。在中国共产党、工人阶级的领导和教育下，我们认识到只有走社会主义的道路，才能实现我们的爱国愿望。因此，中国的民族资产阶级走上了爱国爱社会主义的道路。去年1月20日，工商业者敲锣打鼓，兴高彩烈地进入公私合营，便是一个具体表现。但是，在今后如何继续发扬爱国主义精神，还是我们应该十分重视的问题。
    民族资产阶级是一个具有两面性的阶级。虽然，近几年来，特别在全行业公私合营以后，积极的一面正在不断提高，消极的一面正在逐步缩小，但两面性还是存在的。消极一面的主要表现，便是只顾个人利益、不顾整体利益。消极的一面是随时随地会暴露出来的。我们中有些人在考虑问题的时候往往把个人利益放在第一位，甚至只看到个人的利益。这是一种不利于国家人民和自己的思想作风。国家的利益得不到保障，个人的利益是无法取得的，即使暂时得到，最后也一定保不住。例如，在资本主义社会里，资本家为了个人利益，相互竞争，“大鱼吃小鱼”，相互竞争的结果，有些“大鱼”也终有失败的一天。又如，中国有的民族资本家，曾为了个人的利益，不惜依附帝国主义者，但其结果仍免不了被帝国主义吃掉。历史已经给了我们惨痛的教训。我们并不完全否定个人利益，但是在考虑个人利益的时候，必须把个人利益和国家的利益结合起来，使个人的利益服从国家利益。
    正确认识了国家利益和个人利益的关系，才有可能明辨是非。事物的发展是很复杂的，如果不用正确的立场观点去认识事物，往往就难以明辨是非。工商业者习惯于从个人利益出发看问题，认为对我有利的便是“是”，不利的便是“非”。这样，就很容易模糊是非，迷失方向，对国家，对个人改造都十分不利。其实，是非是容易辨明的，问题在于不要只从个人利益和本位利益出发，而必须从整体利益出发，全面分析问题。例如，在公私共事关系上，如果我们只从个人利益出发，那末，每当自己的主张未被公方、职工采纳的时候，就会埋怨公方、职工，认为公私共事关系搞不好是公方、职工的责任，结果是妨碍了公私共事关系的改善。如果从整体利益出发，全面分析问题，就会认识到自己的主张未必毫无瑕疪，就会虚心听取和采纳公方、职工的意见，就会认识到搞好公私共事关系是双方的责任，也就会主动努力搞好关系，结果公私共事关系就可以改善。又如，随着我国建设事业的发展，原材料供应是会出现紧张状况的。如果我们单从本位的利益出发，那末，就会埋怨政府不供应原料，消极等待。如果从整体利益出发，全面分析问题，就会认识到这是国家建设过程中的困难，人人有责任加以克服，在实际行动中也就会力求采取节约原材料、采用代用品等措施。采取不同的出发点，就会得到不同的结果。其中是非界限十分分明：有利于社会主义的便是“是”，不利于社会主义的便是“非”。
    要明辨是非，除了要从整体利益出发看问题、全面分析之外，还需要学习运用批评和自我批评的武器。七年来，通过许多事实，我认为批评与自我批评是解决人民内部问题的良好方法。我们要勇于批评，更要勇于自我批评。这样，才能使是非越辨越明，使国家的建设事业和我们的个人改造不断前进。然而，只有坚定地从整体利益出发，才能不再斤斤计较个人得失利害，而勇于展开批评和自我批评；同时，也惟有展开了批评和自我批评，才能不断地克服斤斤计较个人利益的旧习惯，坚决地站在整体利益的方面来。
    不仅要明辨是非，我们还应该分清敌我。我们的国家不是孤立的，而是同整个世界形势有着密切关系的。今天整个世界的形势是：社会主义已越出一个国家的范围而变成了世界体系，这历史进程是资本主义无力阻挡的；而资本主义则向着相反的方向发展，日趋没落。为此，帝国主义者便千方百计地破坏社会主义，以挽救其垂死的命运。但是，帝国主义者终究是要失败的。这就是眼前十分明显的形势。身受帝国主义长期压迫的工商业者更是深刻了解的。但是，当国际形势发展到比较错综复杂，国际反动势力不顾一切向着社会主义疯狂进攻的时候，工商界中有些人便认识模糊起来，看不清帝国主义的侵略本质，对社会主义事业的信心发生某些动摇，对帝国主义则存有某些幻想。当帝国主义者采用“援助”的甜言蜜语掩饰它的侵略本质的时候，有些工商业者便曾轻易听信，把这种“援助”和苏联对我国的真诚无私的援助等同起来。其实，帝国主义的所谓“援助”，其目的就是为了侵略。苏联对我国的援助是为了帮助我国的经济文化建设事业，是为了我国人民谋求幸福的生活。因此，我们只有加强同苏联以及各人民民主国家的团结，才能保障我们的幸福，才能使社会主义事业不断发展。我们爱国，不仅要爱社会主义的祖国，而且要爱一切社会主义国家，分清敌我，粉碎帝国主义一切阴谋鬼计，加强社会主义国家之间的紧密团结。
    因此，在发扬爱国主义精神的同时，我们还要注意发扬国际主义精神。我们民族资本家是爱国的；但是，我们的爱国热情，过去是建立在要求民族独立、自主的基础之上。正因如此，我们就很容易产生狭隘的民族主义观点。狭隘的民族主义是一种资产阶级的观点，我们身为资产阶级分子，有这种观念是很自然的。但狭隘的民族主义对加强社会主义国家的团结、全世界进步人类的团结是不利的。我们既然爱国爱社会主义，愿为人类的共同事业——社会主义事业而努力，那末，我们就应当警惕和克服这种狭隘的民族主义，向工人阶级学习，发扬国际主义精神。
    把爱国和爱社会主义一致起来，学习和发扬国际主义精神，对我们个人更有很大的鼓励作用。因为只有这样，我们才能深刻体会到自己的努力是与全人类的共同事业息息相关的，而把自己的积极力量贡献出来。
    以上所述，归根结蒂，关键在于有正确的立场。没有正确的立场，就无法明辨是非，分清敌我；而发扬爱国主义和国际主义精神，也就成为空谈了。工商界中有人认为可以撇开立场来谈问题，甚至怕谈立场，认为一谈立场就无法展开自由辩论，发挥自由思想了。这种意见是错误的。没有一个人没有他的立场，没有立场，就无法认识问题，分析事物。所谓撇开立场，实际上便是另有立场；真正要撇开立场是不可能的。比如，我们热爱民主自由，如果我们只从个人出发，要求无限制的民主自由，结果就必然会损害别人的民主自由，破坏国家的民主秩序，为敌人的破坏阴谋开辟道路。因此，我们要坚定地站在人民的立场，社会主义的立场上，爱国，爱社会主义，发扬爱国主义和国际主义的精神。
    解放以后，工商界有很大的进步，这是中国共产党对我们团结教育的结果，也是我们自己在党的领导下努力改造的结果。中国共产党是以马克思列宁主义武装起来的，它是以马列主义的立场、观点对待一切问题的。工商业者在共产党的领导教育下，才能逐步改变资产阶级的立场、观点，学习和树立工人阶级的立场、观点。我们必须坚决地接受党的领导、工人阶级的领导，把个人利益和国家利益结合起来，明辨是非，分清敌我，继续发扬爱国主义精神和国际主义精神，满怀信心，贡献力量，在祖国的社会主义光明大道上迈进。
