Farmers in Thousand-Jin (500kg/mu) Bumper Harvest County Eagerly Hand Over Public Grain and Sell Surplus Grain

1956 was the year with the largest grain increase in Guangdong Province since liberation. The total grain output is estimated to reach 24 billion jin, an increase of 9.8% compared to 1955. Five "thousand-jin counties" emerged throughout the province. Farmers in the bumper harvest areas are particularly enthusiastic about handing over public grain and selling surplus grain.

The Meide Township Agricultural Cooperative, led by Wang Hanguo, a famous agricultural labor model in Guangdong Province, used to lack grain and had no task of selling surplus grain. In 1956, rice production increased, and the cooperative members decided to sell 70,000 jin of the increased grain to the state.

    广东省著名农业劳动模范汪汉国领导的美德乡农业社，过去缺粮，没有卖余粮的任务。1956年稻谷增产了，社员们决定把增产的粮食拿出七万斤卖给国家。
