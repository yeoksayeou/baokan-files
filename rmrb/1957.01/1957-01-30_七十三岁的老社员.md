    The members of the Xiaoqing River Wooden Sailboat Transportation Cooperative often talked about Hu Chunguang from the cooperative's shipyard. Everyone said that Old Man Hu truly loved the cooperative like his own home; with him in the shipyard, not even a single nail could be lost.

    Hu Chunguang was already seventy-three years old and was a “Five Guarantees” household of the Xiaoqing River Transportation Cooperative. The cooperative subsidized his family with more than thirty yuan each month. His wife sewed tarpaulins and did odd jobs for the cooperative, earning seven or eight jiao, or even one yuan, per day, so they lived quite well. However, he was unwilling to be supported by the cooperative for nothing, so he requested to work at the shipyard.

    “You’re so old, what can you do!” The cooperative director didn't agree.

    “I can’t do heavy work, but I can watch the place.”

    The cooperative director couldn't argue with him, so he agreed.

    In the past, the old planks and scrap wood dismantled from the shipyard were picked up by people to burn in their stoves; the dismantled old nails were picked up by nearby children to sell. No one cared. After Hu Chunguang arrived, these waste materials became the property of the cooperative. He carried a basket every day, picking up this and that, never idle for a moment, and he felt distressed when the cooperative lost anything. Storekeeper Sun Qingrui gave him an accounting: the scrap wood he picked up piece by piece amounted to tens of thousands of jin; the new nails he picked up one by one totaled fifty-three jin, the old nails totaled five hundred and fourteen jin, and the hemp fiber totaled one hundred and sixteen jin.

    One day, Old Man Hu said he wanted to build a toilet to collect manure. Everyone was surprised to hear this, and some people said, "The transportation cooperative doesn't farm, what do we need manure for?" The cooperative director thought the same way. However, Old Man Hu had a different view. He said: there is no toilet in the shipyard, and more than one hundred and twenty cooperative members relieve themselves in the ditch. Not accumulating any manure in three or four months is also a waste. He believed that manure was also the property of the cooperative, and selling it would also be an income for the cooperative. Even if it wasn't sold, giving it to the agricultural production cooperative would also be good. The toilet he built has now accumulated several thousand jin of manure, which can be sold for dozens of yuan.

    People in the cooperative all said: "If all the members were like Old Man Hu, this cooperative could be run even better!"

    七十三岁的老社员
    丁继才
    小清河木帆船运输合作社的社员们凑在一起的时候，常常谈起社里修船厂的胡春广。大家都说胡老汉真是爱社如家，修船厂里有了他，一根钉子也丢不了。
    胡春广已经七十三岁了，是小清河运输社的“五保户”。社里每月给他一家补助三十多块钱，他老伴给社里缝篷，做零活，每天也能收入七、八角，甚至一元，生活过得满好。可是，他不愿意社里白养活他，他要求到修船厂去工作。
    “你这么大年纪啦，还能做啥！”社长不答应。
    “我做不了重活，能看家。”
    社长说不过他，只好同意了。
    从前，修船厂拆下来的旧板、碎木头，叫人家拾去烧了锅；拆下的旧钉，叫附近的孩子拾去卖了，谁也没理过。胡春广来了以后，这些废料就成为社里的财产了。他天天挽着篮子，不是拾掇这，就是拾掇那，从没闲过一会儿，见了社里丢了东西就心痛。保管员孙庆瑞给他算了一笔账：经他一块一块拾起来的碎木头，有好几万斤；经他一颗一颗拾起来的抛撒的新钉子有五十三斤，旧钉子有五百一十四斤，麻刀有一百一十六斤。
    有一天，胡老汉说要垒个厕所，攒粪。大家听了都觉得奇怪，有的人说：“运输社不种地，要粪干啥？”社长也是这样想。胡老汉的看法却不同，他说：修船厂里没有厕所，一百二十多个社员都在沟里大小便，三四个月一点粪也没积下，也是浪费。他认为粪便也是社里的财产，卖了也是社里的一笔收入。就是不卖，送给农业生产合作社，也是好的。经他垒起的厕所，到现在已积下好几千斤大粪，可以卖好几十元。
    社里的人都说：“社员要是都像胡老汉那样，这社还能办得更好！”
