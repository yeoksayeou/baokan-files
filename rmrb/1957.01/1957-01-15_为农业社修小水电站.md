Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: All fifteen rural small hydroelectric stations newly built in various parts of Zhejiang Province in 1956 have been put into operation. Agricultural cooperative members are using the electricity from the hydroelectric stations for tasks such as rice milling, oil pressing, and irrigation, greatly improving efficiency. After the Xiaojiao Hydroelectric Station in Yin County was put into operation, the agricultural cooperative used water turbines to drive rice milling machines instead of water-powered pestles. The amount of rice milled in fifteen minutes is equivalent to the amount milled in two hours in the past. Furthermore, each hundred jin of grain can yield an additional six jin of rice.

    为农业社修小水电站
    据新华社讯　浙江省各地在1956年新建的十五座农村小型水电站，已经全部投入生产。农业社社员们利用水电站的电力，从事碾米、榨油、灌溉等工作，效率大大提高了。鄞县小皎水电站投入生产以后，农业社用水轮机拖动碾米机代替水碓碾米，一刻钟的碾米量，就相当于过去两小时的碾米量，每一百斤谷还可以多出六斤米。
