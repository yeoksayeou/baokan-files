    Merging Two Systems into One, Transforming Disputes into Coordination
    ——The Course and Effects of Commercial System Reform in Taigu County——
    By our reporters Shang Kai and Gu Ye
    Taigu County, Shanxi Province, has been piloting a commercial system reform involving the merging of state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives for the past six months, and it has already achieved good results. The initiative and enthusiasm of local Party and government organs in leading commercial work have been brought into play. After the unified and strengthened leadership of the county's commercial work, the work pace of various commercial departments has become consistent. Commodity sales and agricultural and sideline product procurement plans have also been integrated throughout the county, facilitating the movement of materials and enlivening the urban and rural economy.
    How was the problem raised?
    Before the trial implementation of commercial system reform, Taigu County, like other places, had two independent commercial systems: state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperative commerce. State-owned commerce was responsible for supplying the needs of urban markets; supply and marketing cooperatives (including supply and marketing cooperatives at and below the county level and sales agents) were responsible for the sale of goods in the vast rural areas.
    This division of labor between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in urban and rural areas played a significant role in coordinated operations and jointly transforming urban and rural capitalism in the past. However, this division of labor also easily led to contradictions between state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives, dividing the urban and rural economies and hindering the exchange of materials. For example, in the past, the supply and marketing cooperatives in Taigu County regarded the countryside as their exclusive "territory," prohibiting others from selling goods in rural areas. However, the supply work of the supply and marketing cooperatives themselves could not meet the needs of the masses. Among the 324 villages in the county, 203 villages did not have supply and marketing cooperative organizations or sales agents, and the masses had to travel dozens of miles to buy necessities like salt, vinegar, needles, and thread. Similarly, state-owned commerce regarded the urban market as its area of activity, not allowing supply and marketing cooperatives to intervene.
    Since state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce were two independent commercial systems without unified leadership, their work pace was inconsistent. Furthermore, many commodities were not clearly assigned for operation, often leading to both parties managing the same commodity, resulting in duplicate purchases, waste, and commodity backlog. Once, biscuits were out of stock in the Taigu market, so the supply and marketing cooperative purchased 70,000 jin of biscuits from the Northeast, while the department store transferred in 30,000 jin. As a result, the supply exceeded demand, and more than 60,000 jin of biscuits were backlogged.
    State-owned commerce and cooperative commerce were also uncoordinated in the procurement of agricultural and sideline products. For example, food companies and agricultural product purchasing departments overly emphasized the "one-line" operation method, establishing their own purchasing stations and personnel in rural areas. Due to the small number of people and scarce stations, they were unable to complete the state's procurement tasks, but they did not allow grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives to make purchases. This was the case with live pig purchases in 1955. At that time, the food company had a large task of purchasing live pigs, but there were only five purchasing agents. They could not complete the purchase task even if they ran around, while farmers had pigs but could not sell them.
    The Party and government leaders of Taigu County had also attempted to find ways to solve this situation. However, the supply and marketing cooperatives were under the leadership of the Provincial Cooperative and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives; the work of various state-owned specialized companies in the county was actually directly led by the Ministry of Commerce and the Provincial Department of Commerce. When disputes arose between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce and they sought help from the county Party committee, they each emphasized the vertical leadership of their respective higher-level business departments. Therefore, it was difficult for the county Party committee to resolve the issues.
    In order to solve these problems, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to pilot commercial system reform in Taigu.
    What is the content of the system reform?
    The main content of the commercial system reform in Taigu County is: First, the county supply and marketing cooperative is merged into the county bureau of commerce (still retaining two signs; the board of directors and supervisory board of the county supply and marketing cooperative still exist, and the member representative assembly continues to play its role). Grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives are also placed under the direct leadership and management of the county bureau of commerce. Furthermore, based on the actual needs of Taigu County, some specialized departments of the supply and marketing cooperative and state-owned commerce are adjusted and merged into ten units, such as the department store company, textile company, non-staple food and sundries company, etc. Some of these are local state-owned enterprises, directly led by the county bureau of commerce; others are state-owned enterprises, jointly led and managed by the county bureau of commerce and the Ministry of Commerce. Under the unified leadership of the county bureau of commerce, business meetings are frequently held with the participation of managers of various companies, directors of grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, and persons in charge of joint state-private commercial enterprises. At this meeting, they jointly study the needs of the masses and market conditions, formulate commodity circulation plans, and resolve issues in the interrelationships of various departments.
    Second, the leadership powers of the central and local governments over commercial work are appropriately divided. In the past, many specialized companies were state-owned enterprises, and they overemphasized vertical leadership, with tasks being issued top-down. Local Party and government organs and lower-level companies did not have corresponding flexible powers. Often, when problems arose, the higher levels were out of reach, and the lower levels were willing but unable to act, making it difficult to solve problems. This problem was also appropriately addressed in the trial implementation of system reform—in addition to classifying some enterprises that managed locally produced and sold commodities, such as the means of production company, local trade company, food company, and catering service general store, as county-operated enterprises, the scope of vertical leadership of state-owned enterprises was also partially changed, and local powers were appropriately expanded. For example, if the policy-related instructions and regulations issued by various higher-level companies to lower-level companies were not suitable for local conditions, local Party and government organs could decide to temporarily suspend their implementation after requesting instructions from the higher-level Party committee. In terms of price control, except for state-unified purchase and sale of materials controlled by the state, the prices of other locally produced and sold agricultural and sideline products were controlled by the county, or the province stipulated a certain range, and the county made its own adjustments. At the same time, in terms of profit distribution, it was temporarily stipulated that 40% of the profits of county-operated enterprises would be turned over; 50% would be used as local fiscal revenue of the county; and the remaining 10% would be retained by the enterprises.
    In the process of piloting commercial system reform, Taigu County also adjusted the rural commercial network based on the principles of convenience for the masses and enlivening the urban and rural economy. Supply and marketing cooperatives were established in all market towns, supply and marketing branches were established in each township, and distribution stores, sales agents, or peddlers were sent to each natural village. At the same time, the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives' business of purchasing agricultural and sideline products on behalf of customers was restored, and the free market under state leadership was opened.
    The Effects Already Received
    After the trial implementation of commercial system reform in Taigu County, the contradictions between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce have been resolved, the leadership of local Party and government organs over commercial work has been strengthened, and commercial work has also been significantly improved. Now, commodity adjustments can be made throughout the county, avoiding duplication and waste. At a business meeting convened by the bureau of commerce, according to the opinions of various specialized companies and departments such as supply and marketing cooperatives, state-owned companies exhibited all of their inventory, allowing everyone to freely select and purchase goods, and transactions worth more than 80,000 yuan were concluded in one go. During the selection and purchase process, everyone also proposed more than seventy kinds of commodities that were out of stock or had too few varieties, requesting the organization of sources of goods, and the bureau of commerce immediately organized purchases.
    Some specific business issues between various commercial departments are also handled more promptly than in the past. If such problems had occurred in the past, it would have taken ten and a half days for the official paperwork alone to circulate between the department store and the supply and marketing cooperative to resolve.
    After the commercial system reform, the leadership powers of the central and local governments over commercial work were clearly divided, greatly enhancing the initiative and enthusiasm of local Party and government organs in leading commercial work. In the past, the purchase price of first-class honey in Taigu County was 4.4 jiao per jin, and farmers were unwilling to sell because they thought the price was too low. The county's pharmaceutical industry had to transport honey from other places at a price of 7 jiao per jin. Later, the Party and government leaders of Taigu County decided to adjust the purchase price of honey, and in one or two weeks, they purchased more than 8,800 jin of honey.
    Now, due to the reform of the commercial system and the opening of the free market, the urban and rural economic life in Taigu County has become active. Things that could not be bought in the past can now be bought; things that could not be sold now have a way out. The vitality of urban and rural economic life has directly helped the development of agricultural and sideline production. The county's honey production has increased from the original 100 hives to 500 hives; the number of live pigs has increased from 7,850 in July 1955 to 10,000; and handicraft cooperatives have also reversed the phenomenon of work stoppages and waiting for materials because they can purchase their own raw materials.

    两套合一套，争吵变协调
    ——太谷县试行商业体制改革的经过和效果——
    本报记者　商恺　顾页
    山西省太谷县以国营商业同供销合作社合并为内容的商业体制改革工作试行半年以来，已经收到了很好的效果。地方党政机关领导商业工作的主动性积极性发挥了出来。全县商业工作统一和加强领导后，各个商业部门的工作步调一致了，商品进销和农副产品的收购计划也都在全县范围内衔接起来，便利了物资运转，活跃了城乡经济。
    问题是怎样提出来的？
    太谷县在试行商业体制改革以前，同其他地方一样，存在着两套独立的商业系统——国营商业和供销社商业。国营商业负责供应城镇市场的需要；供销合作社（包括县以下各级供销社和代销员）负责广大农村的商品供销工作。
    国营商业和合作社商业的这种城乡分工，过去在协同作战、共同对城乡资本主义进行改造方面虽然起了很大的作用，但是这样的分工也容易形成国营商业同供销社的工作彼此矛盾，城乡经济被分割，物资交流受到阻碍。比如，过去太谷县供销社就把农村当成了他们独有的“阵地”，不许别人下乡卖货。但是，供销社自己的供应工作又满足不了群众的需要。全县三百二十四个村子，其中就有二百零三个村子没有供销社的机构或代销员，群众称盐打醋，抽针买线，都要跑到几十里以外去。同样的，国营商业也把城镇市场看成是自己的活动范围，不允许供销社插足。
    国营商业和合作社商业既然是两套独立的商业系统，又没有统一的领导，因而工作步调互不一致；再加上许多商品的经营没有明确分工，常常是一种商品，两家经营，双方进货，造成重复浪费，商品积压。有一次，太谷市场饼干脱销了，供销社就从东北购进饼干七万斤，而百货公司又调来了三万斤。结果供过于求，积压饼干六万斤以上。
    在农副产品的收购上，国营商业和合作社商业也不协调。比如，食品公司和农产品采购部门过分强调“一条线”的经营方法，在农村设立自己的收购站和收购人员。由于人少站稀，无力完成国家的收购任务，但是他们又不让基层供销社收购。1955年收购生猪的情况便是如此。当时食品公司收购生猪的任务很大，收购员却只有五名，他们跑断了腿也无法完成收购任务，而农民有猪却卖不出去。
    对于这种情况，太谷县的党政领导也曾企图设法解决。但是，供销社是属于省社和全国供销合作总社领导；县里各个国营专业公司的工作，实际上也是由商业部和省商业厅直接领导。当国营商业和合作社商业在工作上发生争执去找县委的时候，他们往往各自强调自己上级业务部门的垂直领导。因此，县委也难于解决。
    为解决这些问题，中共山西省委决定在太谷试行商业体制改革。
    体制改革的内容是什么
    太谷县的商业体制改革的主要内容是：首先，把县供销社合并到县商业局（仍挂两个牌子，县供销社的理事会、监事会仍然存在，社员代表大会继续发挥它的作用），基层供销社也划归县商业局直接领导和管理。并且根据太谷县的实际需要，把供销社和国营商业的一些专业部门调整合并为百货公司、纺织品公司、副食杂品公司等十个单位，其中有的是地方国营企业，由县商业局直接领导；有的是国营企业，由县商业局和商业部共同领导和管理。在县商业局的统一领导下，经常举行由各公司经理、基层供销社主任、公私合营商业的负责人参加的业务会议。在这个会议上，共同研究群众需要和市场情况，制定商品流转计划，解决各个部门相互关系中的问题。
    其次，是把中央和地方对商业工作的领导职权适当分工。过去，许多专业公司都是国营企业，他们过分强调垂直领导，自上而下的条条下达任务，地方党政机关和下级公司没有相应的机动权利，往往一遇到问题，上边是鞭长莫及，下边是心有余而力不足，问题不易解决。在试行体制改革中，也适当地解决了这个问题——除了把一部分经营地产地销商品的企业，如生产资料公司、地方贸易公司、食品公司、饮食服务总店等，划为县营企业外，还部分地改变了国营企业的垂直领导范围，适当地扩大了地方职权。比如，各个上级公司对下级公司发出的有关政策性的指示和规定，如果不适合当地情况，地方党政机关经请示上级党委后，可以决定暂缓执行。在价格掌握上，除国家统购统销的物资由国家统一掌握外，其他地产地销的农副产品的价格，由县统一掌握，或者由省规定一定的幅度，县里自行调整。同时在利润分配上，暂时规定将县营企业利润的40％上交；50％作为县地方财政收入；其余10％留给企业。
    太谷县在试行商业体制改革的过程中，还根据便利群众和活跃城乡经济的原则，调整了农村商业网，在所有的集镇都设立了供销社，每个乡设立了供销分社，各个自然村里设立了分销店、代销员或是派货郎担下去；并且恢复了基层供销社代购农副产品的业务，和这同时，还开放了国家领导下的自由市场。
    已经收到的效果
    太谷县试行商业体制改革以后，国营商业同合作社商业的矛盾解决了，当地党政机关对商业工作的领导加强了，商业工作也有了显著改进。现在可以在全县范围内进行商品调剂，避免了重复浪费的现象。在商业局召开的一次业务会议上，根据各专业公司和供销社等部门的意见，国营公司把所有的库存商品都展览出来，让大家自由选购，一次就成交了八万多元。在选购的时候，大家又提出七十多种已经脱销或者品种太少的商品，要求组织货源，商业局便马上组织进货。
    各个商业部门之间的一些具体业务问题，也比过去处理得及时了。如果过去发生了这类问题，在百货公司和供销社之间光公文手续就要往返周转十天半月，才能解决。
    经过商业体制改革，明确划分了中央和地方对商业工作的领导职权以后，大大地发挥了地方党政机关领导商业工作的主动性和积极性。过去太谷县的头等蜂蜜的收购价格是四角四分一斤，农民嫌价格低不愿卖；本县制药业用蜜，不得不用每斤七角的价格从外地调运来。后来，太谷县的党政领导决定调整了蜂蜜的收购价格，在一、二十天的时间里，就收购到蜂蜜八千八百多斤。
    现在，由于商业体制的改革和自由市场的开放，太谷县的城乡经济生活活跃起来了。过去买不到的东西可以买到了；卖不了的东西有了出路了。城乡经济生活的活跃，直接帮助了农副业生产的发展；全县生产的蜂蜜，由原来的一百箱，增加到五百箱；生猪由1955年7月份的七千八百五十头，增加到一万头；手工业社也因为可以自购原料而扭转了停工待料的现象。
