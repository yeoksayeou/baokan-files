Xinhua News Agency, Kangding, January 8th: The first sub-delegation of the Central 慰问 Delegation has concluded its 慰问 activities in various parts of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.

The various teams of the first sub-delegation of the Central 慰问 Delegation, since leaving Kangding at the end of November last year to carry out 慰问 activities in various places, have successively arrived in Kangding, Qianning, Daofu, Luhuo, Ganzi, Dege, Litang, Yajiang, Jiulong, Danba, Xinlong, and Baiyu and other twelve counties. They met with and conducted cordial 慰问 activities with more than 50,000 people of all ethnic groups, cadres, and troops.

Wherever the Central 慰问 Delegation went, it was warmly welcomed by the people of all ethnic groups. From along the Kangzang Highway, crossing over Zheduo Mountain and Que'er Mountain, all the way to the Jinsha River, from the Dadu River, Yalong River, and Zheduo River, to the Litang city walls, which are over 4,000 meters above sea level, cheers resounded everywhere. People lit cypress branches, which are only used when welcoming the highest religious leaders, beat gongs and drums, blew conch shells, and danced the Xianzi and Guozhuang dances that are performed during grand gatherings. Many people, in order to be able to meet with the relatives sent by Chairman Mao, rode horses from remote mountain valleys dozens or even hundreds of miles away, bringing buttered tea, tsampa, and tents, and came to the places the 慰问 delegation passed through or stayed.

In addition to assisting local areas in further publicizing the Central government's peaceful reform guidelines and policies, and carrying out united front work, the Central 慰问 Delegation also distributed a large amount of relief grain and winter clothing in various places. In order to repay the care of the Central government and Chairman Mao, many people expressed their willingness to further strengthen national unity, follow the instructions of the Party and the government, and strive to gradually complete the democratic reform tasks of the entire prefecture.

The Central 慰问 Delegation's song and dance troupe, film projection team, and medical team also carried out 慰问 performances, film screenings, and free medical treatment for the people of all ethnic groups in various places. In nearly two months, a total of 47 performances were given, with an audience of more than 57,000 people; 151 film screenings were held, with an audience of more than 126,000 person-times; and more than 20,000 people of all ethnic groups received free medical treatment.

    中央慰问团第一分团
    结束在甘孜地区的慰问工作
    新华社康定8日电　中央慰问团第一分团已结束在甘孜藏族自治州各地的慰问活动。
    中央慰问团第一分团的各路人员，从去年11月底离开康定前往各地进行慰问以来，先后到达了康定、乾宁、道孚、炉霍、甘孜、德格、理塘、雅江、九龙、丹巴、新龙和白玉等十二个县，和五万多各族人民、干部和部队见了面，并进行了亲切的慰问。
    中央慰问团每到一处，都受到各族人民的隆重欢迎。从康藏公路沿线，和翻越折多山、雀儿山直到金沙江边，从大渡河、雅砻江、折多河，直到拔海四千多公尺的理塘城垣，到处欢声载道。人们燃起了在欢迎宗教界最高领袖时才用的柏枝，打起了锣鼓，吹起了海螺，跳起了举行盛会时的弦子和锅庄。许多人为了能够和毛主席派来的亲人见一见面，从几十里甚至数百里以外的深山野谷，骑着马、带着酥油、?粑和帐篷，来到了慰问团经过的地方或住处。
    中央慰问团在各地除协助当地进一步宣传了中央的和平改革方针、政策，和进行统战工作外，还发放了大批救济粮和寒衣。为了报答中央和毛主席的关怀，许多人表示要进一步加强民族团结，遵照党和政府的指示，为逐步完成全州的民主改革任务而努力。
    中央慰问团歌舞团、电影队和医疗队，在各地也进行了慰问演出、放映电影和给各族人民免费治病。将近两个月来，共演出四十七场，观众达五万七千多人；放映电影一百五十一场，观众达十二万六千多人次；受到免费治疗疾病的各族人民共有二万多人。
