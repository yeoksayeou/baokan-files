Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 22nd: According to the Middle East News Agency, all of Jordan warmly welcomes the agreement signed by Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan to provide financial aid to Jordan. It is said that the day the agreement was signed will henceforth be celebrated as a national holiday.

King Hussein of Jordan and the Jordanian government delegation, which recently went to Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia to negotiate financial aid, returned to Amman on the 21st. They were warmly welcomed by thousands of people at the airport. Triumphal arches were erected at the airport and along the streets, and the city was decorated with colorful lights and flags.

Mustafa Khalifa, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Jordanian Parliament, said that the agreement signed by the leaders of the four Arab countries marks a turning point in Arab history, demonstrating the cooperation and unity of free Arab nations.

Abdul Rahman Shukair, leader of the National Front, hopes that the entire Arab world will completely eliminate any form of foreign influence.

Parliamentarian Faik Warad said that the agreement is "a realistic and timely response to the so-called Eisenhower Doctrine."

According to the Middle East News Agency, the Jordanian government has cancelled several transactions for the purchase of British goods.

Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: TASS, Cairo, January 21st: According to a "Al-Ahram" reporter from Washington, the Cairo conference of Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan has caused serious unease among leaders of the U.S. State Department.

The reporter wrote that U.S. officials fear that Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan will form a united front against the "Eisenhower Doctrine" after the Cairo conference. These people are also concerned that the talks between the leaders of the Arab countries will weaken the efforts the United States is preparing to make: the United States wants to make King Saud more moderate in his treatment of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" during his upcoming visit to the United States.

The "Al-Ahram" reporter pointed out that according to a senior official of the U.S. State Department, the agreement reached by the four Arab countries in dealing with the new U.S. policy toward the Middle East "will have a harmful effect on the Eisenhower Doctrine."

    全约旦欢迎埃叙沙三国援助
    美国害怕阿拉伯四国联合反对“艾森豪威尔主义”
    据新华社开罗22日电　据中东通讯社报道，约旦全国热烈欢迎埃、叙、沙、约四国签订向约旦提供财政援助的协定。据说，签订协定的那一天从此将被作为全国性的节日来庆祝。
    约旦国王侯赛尼和前些时候去埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯谈判财政援助问题的约旦政府代表团在21日回到安曼。他们在机场受到数千群众的热烈欢迎。飞机场和各条街道上都建立起了胜利拱门，全市被彩色电灯和旗帜装饰得喜气洋洋。
    约旦议会外交委员会主席穆斯塔法·哈利法说，四个阿拉伯国家领导人签订的协定标志着阿拉伯历史的转折点，它显示了自由阿拉伯国家的合作和团结。
    全国阵线领导人阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·舒凯尔希望整个阿拉伯世界彻底清除任何形式的外国影响。
    议员法伊克·瓦拉德说，这个协定是“对所谓艾森豪威尔主义的一个现实的和及时的回答”。
    据中东通讯社报道，约旦政府已经取消了几笔关于购买英国货物的交易。
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社开罗21日讯：据“金字塔报”记者从华盛顿报道，埃、叙、沙、约四国开罗会议已经引起美国国务院领导人士的严重不安。
    记者写道，美国官方人士害怕埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯和约旦在开罗会议以后会结成统一战线来反对“艾森豪威尔主义”。这些人还耽心阿拉伯国家领导人的会谈将会削弱美国准备作出的努力：美国想使国王沙特在他即将访问美国的期间更加温和地对待“艾森豪威尔主义”。
    “金字塔报”记者指出，据美国国务院的一个高级官员承认，四个阿拉伯国家在对待美国对中东政策的新方针方面所达成的协议，“将会给艾森豪威尔主义带来有害的影响”。
