    Five-Year-Old Pianist
    Recently, a five-year-old pianist, Chen Min, has emerged in Guangzhou. She has been a student of the famous pianist Li Suxin since she was three years old. She has now learned more than two hundred pieces and can play more than seventy relatively complex performance pieces, including Beethoven's sonatinas and Tchaikovsky's children's piano pieces.
    Chen Min is a child at the affiliated kindergarten of the Fourteenth Elementary School in the central district of Guangzhou. Her parents are both doctors and music lovers.
    Eleven-Year-Old Suona Player
    Zhao Chengfu, an eleven-year-old Yao nationality suona player, recently gave an outstanding performance at the Second Guangxi Provincial Folk Art Performance Conference.
    This young Yao nationality suona player can skillfully use the method of breathing in through the nose and exhaling through the mouth. He played four tunes popular in his hometown, such as "Xiao Nanjing Gong Fanzhi", with a clear and lively rhythm and a round and pleasant tone, expressing the lively and joyful emotions of the Yao people during weddings, infecting the audience present.
    Zhao Chengfu is from Yangxi Township, Fuzhong County. He has loved music since he was a child and often carefully observed the playing techniques of others. He began learning the suona from Zhao Tubao, an old Yao artist, at the age of eight. (Xinhua News Agency)

    儿童音乐家
    五岁的钢琴手
    最近，广州市出现了一个五岁的小钢琴手——陈敏，她从三岁起就做了著名的钢琴家李素心的学生。她现在已学会了二百多首曲子，能弹奏七十多首比较复杂的演奏曲，其中有著名作曲家贝多芬的小奏鸣曲、柴可夫斯基的儿童钢琴曲等。
    陈敏是广州市中区第十四小学附属幼儿园的儿童。他的父母都是医生，也是音乐爱好者。
    十一岁的唢呐手
    十一岁的瑶族唢呐手赵成福，最近在广西省第二届民间文艺会演大会上作了出色表演。
    这位瑶族小唢呐手能够熟练地运用鼻吸口呼的运气方法吹奏。他吹奏“小南京宫反指”等四个流传在他家乡的曲牌，节奏鲜明活泼，音色圆润悦耳，把瑶族人民婚娶时热闹欢乐的情绪表达出来，感染着在场的听众。
    赵成福是富锺县洋溪乡人。他从小喜爱音乐，时常留心观察别人的吹弹技巧，八岁起就跟瑶族老艺人赵土保学吹唢呐。（据新华社讯）
