Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 31st. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC invited democratic personages from all walks of life to a symposium on December 29th to solicit their opinions on the work of the Party and government departments over the past year. Several responsible cadres of the Municipal Committee attended the meeting and listened to everyone's criticisms and suggestions.

More than 50 people attended the meeting, including heads of local organizations of various democratic parties in Chongqing, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, people's organizations such as the Health Workers Association, and non-party democratic personages. They put forward many sincere criticisms of the work of the Party and government departments. The heads of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League and the Chongqing Branch of the Jiusan Society said that the Party and the government had done a lot of work among senior intellectuals in 1956, and the relationship between the Party and the masses in universities and colleges had improved. However, they felt that the current political and ideological education work among intellectuals was still poor, and the connection between the Party and senior intellectuals was not close enough. Many intellectuals requested the Party to provide more help and care. The person in charge of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) and the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPPCC put forward opinions and suggestions on contacting former Kuomintang military and political personnel, social figures, and other work.

The heads of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA), the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party (CPWDP), and representatives of the industrial and commercial circles put forward many opinions on the transformation of industrialists and businessmen and the promotion of the enthusiasm of medical staff. People from industrial and commercial circles said that at present, many joint ventures are focused on production work for the private sector personnel, but ideological education work is somewhat relaxed. For example, there are currently 2,400 private sector personnel studying in joint ventures, but some units have not provided good leadership for the private sector personnel to study. They requested the Party and the government to strengthen the ideological transformation of private sector personnel. In addition, they also pointed out that the current work arrangements for a small number of private sector personnel are not appropriate, and their skills and expertise cannot be brought into play. The heads of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and the Health Workers Association criticized the Chongqing Municipal Health Administration Department for its shortcomings in using joint clinics too much but providing too little help. They said that the current system of many joint clinics is chaotic, and the enthusiasm of medical staff cannot be fully utilized, which urgently needs to be improved.

Many people expressed their opinions on the one-sidedness and untimeliness of the publicity of the Party and the government in the opening of free markets under state leadership and wage reform work. They also requested the Party to widely conduct publicity and education among the broad masses of cadres on the United Front policy, the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," and the redemption policy.

Representatives of various democratic parties and people's organizations proposed that in the future, the Party and the government should contact them more, help them improve their work, and better play the role of their organizations.

Ren Baige, Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC, concluded by saying that in 1956, the Party and the government focused their main efforts on industrial and agricultural production and socialist transformation work, and the leadership of cultural and educational work was insufficient. The opinions put forward by everyone will be of great help to the Party and government departments in improving their future work, and these opinions will be handled separately by relevant units. Ren Baige spoke about the tasks for 1957, and he hoped that various democratic parties and people's organizations would better and more supervise and assist the Party and the government in doing a good job in all aspects of work in 1957.

    中共重庆市委会年终邀民主人士座谈
    征求对党和政府工作的意见
    新华社重庆31日电　中共重庆市委员会在12月29日邀请各方面民主人士座谈，征求他们对党和政府部门一年来工作的意见。市委几个负责干部都出席会议，听取大家的批评和建议。
    出席会议的各民主党派在重庆的地方组织和工商联、卫生工作者协会等人民团体的负责人和无党派民主人士等五十多人，对党和政府部门的工作提出了许多恳切的批评。民盟重庆市委员会和九三学社重庆分社负责人说，1956年党和政府在高级知识分子中做了不少工作，高等学校的党和群众的关系有了改进。但是他们感到目前在知识分子中的政治思想教育工作做得还差，党与高级知识分子联系不够密切，不少知识分子要求党给予更多的帮助和关怀。民革重庆市委员会和政协重庆市委员会负责人等对联系原国民党军政人员、社会人士等工作方面提出了意见和建议。
    民建重庆市委员会、农工民主党重庆市委员会负责人和工商界代表人物在对工商业者改造工作和发挥医务人员的积极性方面提了不少意见。工商界人士说，目前不少合营企业中对私方人员在生产工作方面抓得紧，思想教育工作却有些放松。例如，目前在合营企业学习的私方人员有两千四百人，但是有些单位没有很好领导私方人员学习。他们要求党和政府加强对私方人员的思想改造工作。另外，他们还提出目前有少数私方人员的工作安排不够妥当，不能发挥他们的技能和专长。农工民主党重庆市委员会、卫生工作者协会等组织的负责人批评了重庆市卫生行政部门对联合诊所使用多、帮助少的缺点。他们说，目前不少联合诊所制度混乱，医务人员积极性不能充分发挥，亟须改进。
    不少人对党和政府在开放国家领导下的自由市场、工资改革工作等方面在宣传上的片面性和不及时提出了意见。他们还要求党在广大干部中广泛地进行关于统一战线政策、“长期共存、互相监督”的方针、赎买政策等内容的宣传教育工作。
    各民主党派和人民团体的代表提出，今后党和政府要更多地同他们联系，帮助他们改进工作，更好地发挥他们组织的作用。
    中共重庆市委书记任白戈最后说，1956年党和政府主要力量放在工农业生产和社会主义改造工作方面，对文教等工作领导得不够。大家提出来的意见，对党和政府部门改进今后工作有很多帮助，这些意见将由有关单位分别处理。任白戈谈到了1957年的任务，他希望各民主党派和人民团体今后更好更多地监督、协助党和政府做好1957年的各项工作。
