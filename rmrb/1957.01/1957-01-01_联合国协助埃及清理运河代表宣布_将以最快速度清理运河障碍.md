Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 31st – Wheeler, the United Nations representative assisting Egypt in clearing the Suez Canal, announced in a press release on the 30th that the clearing of the Suez Canal will be carried out at the fastest possible speed with the full cooperation of the Egyptian authorities and the assistance of the United Nations.

The press release stated that the clearing work of the canal will be carried out in three phases.

In the first phase, a temporary limited channel will be cleared for ships of approximately 10,000 tons to pass through. This work includes salvaging sunken ships and clearing two damaged bridges south of Cap and other obstacles. This work is estimated to be completed in early March 1957.

In the second phase, the remaining obstacles will be cleared. This clearing work will expand the navigable channel to allow ships with the deepest draft to pass through. At the same time, dredging work will be carried out and the plants and lighting and communication systems required for completely normal navigation will be repaired. This phase of work is expected to be completed in May 1957.

In the third phase, the remaining obstacles in the port and dockyard will be cleared, and the dockyards and moorings will be restored to their original condition.

A joint Danish and Dutch consortium—Smit Company of Rotterdam and Switzer Company of Copenhagen—will be responsible for scheduling the United Nations salvage operations. They will be assisted by salvage vessels and experts from Belgium, West Germany, Sweden and Italy. The United Nations fleet will include approximately thirty salvage vessels, of which twenty-five have already arrived at the Suez Canal.

    联合国协助埃及清理运河代表宣布
    将以最快速度清理运河障碍
    新华社开罗31日电　联合国协助埃及清理苏伊士运河的代表惠勒在30日发表新闻公报说，苏伊士运河的清理工作将在埃及当局的充分合作和联合国的协助下以最快的速度进行。
    新闻公报说，清理运河的工作将分三个阶段进行。
    在第一阶段，将清理出一条暂时的有限的通道，供大约一万吨的船只通行。这项工作包括打捞沉船，清除卡普以南两座被破坏的桥和其他的障碍物。这项工作估计将在1957年3月初完成。
    在第二阶段，将清除其余的障碍物。这项清理工作将使可航行的通道扩大，以便让吃水最深的船只通过。同时将进行疏浚工作和修理为完全正常的通航所需的工厂以及照明、通讯系统。这个阶段的工作大概将在1957年5月完成。
    在第三阶段将清除港口和船坞的余下的障碍，并且把船坞和停泊所恢复到它们原来的状况。
    一个丹麦和荷兰的联合财团——鹿特丹的斯米特公司和哥本哈根的斯维策公司——将负责调度联合国的打捞工作。它们将得到比利时、西德、瑞典和意大利的打捞船只和专家的协助。联合国的船队将包括大约三十艘打捞船，其中二十五艘已经到达苏伊士运河。
