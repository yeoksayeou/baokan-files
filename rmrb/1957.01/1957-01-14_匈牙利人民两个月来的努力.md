The declaration issued by the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government on January 6 regarding the most important tasks at present is a sign that the domestic situation in Hungary is fundamentally improving. It marks the complete failure of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary instigated by imperialism, the gradual establishment of the proletarian dictatorship based on the worker-peasant alliance within Hungary, and the gradual restoration and stabilization of the national economic life and social order.

In the two months since the establishment of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, the Hungarian revolutionary forces and the Hungarian people have encountered various difficulties. They have not only suffered from the armed rebellion and political offensives of domestic counter-revolutionary elements and the serious economic difficulties caused by the October events, but have also been constantly subjected to unreasonable interference from the imperialist bloc headed by the United States. However, with the efforts of all revolutionary forces in Hungary, the achievements of Hungarian socialism have finally been defended. The Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government has increasingly and firmly controlled the domestic situation, and has finally overcome all difficulties and continuously improved the political and economic situation in Hungary.

This fundamental improvement of the domestic situation in Hungary is the result of major efforts by the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government. They adhered to the revolutionary stance and adopted correct measures to lead and unite the entire party and the people of the country to gradually overcome numerous difficulties. At the same time, the moral and material assistance provided by fraternal countries is also a necessary factor in helping Hungary overcome its economic difficulties.

The resolution passed by the Provisional Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party at its meeting in early December last year made a profound analysis of the nature and causes of the October events, and clearly pointed out that this event was not a revolution, but a counter-revolution. At the same time, the resolution also made a comprehensive analysis and stipulation on the domestic situation in Hungary and the tasks for the future. This meeting was of great significance for clarifying the ideological understanding of the broad masses of the people and promoting the development of the domestic situation.

What work has the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government done and what important measures have been taken in the past two months? In summary, it can be divided into the following three aspects:

The first important measure taken by the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government was to resolutely suppress the counter-revolution, crush the armed offensive of the counter-revolution, dissolve the regional workers' committees in Budapest and other places that were engaged in counter-revolutionary and anti-government activities, establish the decree on armed defense of factories, and arrest the resolutely resistant counter-revolutionary elements.

As everyone knows, the armed offensive of the counter-revolution was crushed on November 4. After their defeat, the counter-revolutionary elements used words such as "workers'" and "revolutionary" to cover themselves up and continue to incite workers to strike. However, their attempts were gradually seen through by workers, peasants, and intellectuals who longed for normal life. Subsequently, the counter-revolutionary elements used the slogans of "democracy" and "freedom" to carry out sabotage activities. At that time, the Budapest Central Workers' Committee even demanded to control the power of the troops maintaining public order. The Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government took suppressive measures against the enemy's sabotage activities, gave the enemy a serious blow, and finally ended this chaotic situation.

While resolutely suppressing the counter-revolution, the Hungarian revolutionary forces also vigorously launched the work of building the party and the army, and achieved remarkable results. This is another important victory achieved by the Hungarian revolutionary forces in the past two months. In the October events, the Hungarian working-class party and army were in a state of disintegration. At present, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has more than 100,000 party members, and 20,000 people in Budapest have joined the party. Party branches have been established in larger factories, and party life and organizational activities have also become active. In solving the tasks currently facing the Hungarian people, the Communist Party members have been playing a leading role. The public security forces have also been established and are increasingly strengthened, and are playing an increasingly important role in maintaining the revolutionary order in the country. Now the public security forces in Budapest can guarantee the order of the capital.

At the same time, the Hungarian party and government have also vigorously launched the work of rapidly restoring production, first of all, restoring coal production. In order to increase coal production, the government mobilized many workers to work in coal mines and increased the wages of coal miners. In order to improve the living conditions of coal miners, the government has recently decided to prepare to build more than 10,000 houses for miners. Now coal production is rapidly increasing. On January 8, the coal production in various parts of Hungary reached 43,450 tons, reaching the highest daily output since the October events. Now there are more than 60,000 coal miners in the country, which is equivalent to four-fifths of the pre-October events. In the new agricultural policy recently promulgated by the government, the system of compulsory purchase has been officially abolished, allowing farmers to have complete freedom in choosing their business methods. At present, the government continues to support the development of cooperatives on the one hand, and vigorously takes care of the production enthusiasm of individual farmers on the other hand. In addition to the majority of agricultural cooperatives that have been preserved, 195 new ones have been established recently. At present, Hungary has completed 87% of the sowing plan. This shows that the situation in the Hungarian countryside is good.

Although Hungary has done a lot of work and achieved many achievements in the short period of more than two months, there are still many serious difficulties on the road to fully restoring normal life and building socialism in Hungary.

What are the main difficulties at present?

In the political aspect, although the counter-revolutionary elements have been severely hit, the remnants of the counter-revolution have not been completely eliminated. They are still using various methods to incite people's hearts, provoke the relationship between the people and the government, undermine the prestige of the Socialist Workers' Party and the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, and hinder the work of the party and the government in building the party, the government, and the army in various places. These counter-revolutionary elements also maintain contact with foreign imperialist forces, and they are waiting for foreign intervention in Hungary in order to re-ignite their criminal activities against Hungary.

In the economic aspect, due to the sabotage carried out by the counter-revolutionary elements in the October events, especially the destruction of Budapest's industry, Hungary's industrial production suffered a major loss. Budapest's industrial production accounts for 60%-70% of Hungary's total industrial production. During the counter-revolutionary riots, industrial production here not only came to a standstill, but also suffered serious damage. In this incident, Hungary's industrial production suffered a loss of about 9 billion forints due to the stagnation and destruction. During this period, nearly 2 billion forints of wages were still paid as usual. During the riots, a large amount of commodity storage was also looted, 3,000 houses were completely destroyed, and 10,000 houses were partially destroyed, and it will take 1 billion forints to repair these houses. All of these have brought serious difficulties to Hungary's national economy. In addition, the lack of raw materials, the shortage of coal and electricity, have also affected the normal operation of industrial production, and it has been necessary to reduce industrial production. Therefore, according to the materials published by Hungary, it is estimated that the work of 100,000 or 200,000 laborers will be affected this year. As a result of the reduction of institutions, a large number of employees will also be laid off. At the same time, due to the reduction of industrial production, the supply of various machines and agricultural implements needed by agriculture will inevitably be affected to a certain extent. Under such circumstances, restoring production, especially restoring coal production, eliminating the threat of inflation, and arranging relief for the unemployed have become a very arduous task for the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government at present.

The declaration issued by the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government on the most important tasks in Hungary at present has formulated some temporary measures to solve the current economic difficulties. The implementation of these measures and the support of fraternal countries will gradually overcome the difficulties encountered by Hungary in the economic aspect, and the improvement of the economic situation will also promote the domestic political situation to become more stable.

    匈牙利人民两个月来的努力
    刘竞
    1月6日，匈牙利工农革命政府就当前最重要的任务发表的声明，是匈牙利国内情况趋向根本好转的标志。它标志着在帝国主义策动下的匈牙利的反革命叛乱已经彻底失败，以工农联盟为基础的无产阶级专政正在匈牙利国内逐步建立起来，全国经济生活和社会秩序已逐步恢复和稳定了。
    在工农革命政府成立以来的两个多月中，匈牙利革命力量和匈牙利人民曾经遇到了各种各样的困难。它不仅遭到了国内反革命分子的武装叛乱、政治进攻和由于十月事件所造成的严重的经济困难，而且还不断地受到以美国为首的帝国主义集团的无理干涉。但是，在匈牙利一切革命力量的努力下，匈牙利社会主义的成果终于被保卫住了。匈牙利工农革命政府已日益巩固地控制着国内的局势，并且终于排除万难而使匈牙利的政治经济情况不断地趋向好转。
    匈牙利国内情况的这种根本性好转，是匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府进行了重大努力的结果。它们坚持革命立场并采取正确措施，领导和团结全党和全国人民，逐步克服重重困难。同时，兄弟国家所提供的道义和物资援助，也是帮助匈牙利克服经济困难的必要因素。
    去年12月初举行的匈牙利社会主义工人党临时中央委员会会议所通过的决议，对十月事件的性质和起因作了深刻的分析，明确地指出这次事件不是革命，而是反革命。同时，决议也对匈牙利国内的局势和今后的任务作了全面的分析和规定。这次会议是对澄清国内广大群众的思想认识和促进国内局势向前发展具有重大的意义。
    工农革命政府在这两个多月中作了哪些工作、采取了什么重要措施呢？总括起来可以分为下述三个方面：
    工农革命政府所采取的第一个重要措施就是坚决镇压反革命，粉碎了反革命的武装进攻，解散了进行反革命反政府活动的布达佩斯和其他地方的区域性的工人委员会，确定了武装保卫工厂条例的法令，同时逮捕了坚决顽抗的反革命分子。
    大家知道，反革命的武装进攻是在11月4日被粉碎的。反革命分子在失败以后，又用“工人的”、“革命的”这类字眼来掩盖自己，继续煽动工人罢工。但是他们的企图逐渐被渴望正常生活的工人、农民、知识分子识破了。随后，反革命分子又利用“民主”和“自由”的口号来进行破坏活动。当时布达佩斯中央工人委员会甚至还要求掌握维持治安的部队的权力。工农革命政府对于敌人的破坏活动采取了镇压措施，给了敌人以严重打击，终于结束了这种混乱局面。
    匈牙利革命力量在坚决镇压反革命的同时，也大力展开了建党和建军的工作，并且获得了显著的成绩。这是匈牙利革命力量两个多月以来所取得的又一个重要胜利。在十月事件中，匈牙利的工人阶级政党和军队曾陷于瓦解状态。目前，匈牙利社会主义工人党已拥有十万多党员，在布达佩斯已有两万人参加了党。在较大的工厂中已经成立了党的支部，党的生活和组织活动也已活跃起来。在解决匈牙利人民现在所面临的任务方面，共产党员已起着主导的作用。公安部队也已经建立起来，而且日益加强，在维护国内的革命秩序方面，它正起着日益重要的作用。现在布达佩斯的公安部队已能保证首都的秩序。
    同时，匈牙利的党和政府还大力展开了迅速恢复生产的工作，首先是恢复煤的生产。为了提高煤的产量，政府动员了不少工人到煤矿工作，并提高了煤矿工人的工资。为了改进煤矿工人的居住条件，最近政府已决定准备为矿工建造一万多套住宅。现在煤产量正在迅速提高。1月8日匈牙利全国各地的煤产量已有四万三千四百五十吨，达到了十月事件以后的最高日产量。现在全国煤矿工人已有六万多名左右，相当于十月事件以前的五分之四。在最近政府所颁布的新的农业政策中，已正式宣布废除了义务征购制，让农民在选择经营方式方面有完全的自由。目前政府一方面继续支持合作社的发展，而另一方面也大力照顾个体农民的生产积极性。农业合作社除了大部分仍然保存下来以外，最近还新成立了一百九十五个。目前，匈牙利全国已经完成了播种计划的87％。这说明匈牙利农村的情况是良好的。
    虽然匈牙利在短短的两个多月中作了许多工作，而且取得了许多成绩，但是在匈牙利完全恢复正常生活、建设社会主义的道路上，仍然还有许多严重的困难。
    目前主要还存在着那些困难呢？
    在政治方面，反革命分子虽已受到严重的打击，但是反革命的残余仍未完全肃清。他们仍然采取各种方式在煽动人心，挑拨人民和政府的关系，破坏社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的威信，并阻挠党和政府在各地的建党建政和建军的工作。这些反革命分子还保持着与国外帝国主义势力的联系，他们在等待着外国对匈牙利的干涉，以便从新挑起对匈牙利的罪恶勾当。
    在经济方面，由于反革命分子在十月事件中所进行的破坏，特别是对布达佩斯工业的破坏，使匈牙利工业生产遭到了重大的损失。布达佩斯的工业生产占匈牙利全国工业生产的60％—70％，在反革命暴乱期间，这里的工业生产不但陷于停顿，而且遭到了严重的破坏。在这次事件中，匈牙利的工业生产由于停顿和破坏而受到的损失约达九十亿福林。而在这段期间内又照旧付出了近二十亿福林的工资。在暴乱期间，大量的商品储存也被抢劫一空，三千所住宅被完全破坏，一万所住宅也受到了部分破坏，要修复这些住宅将需要十亿福林。所有这些，都给匈牙利的国民经济带来了严重的困难。此外，由于原料的缺乏、煤和电力的不足，也影响了工业生产的正常进行，并且不得不削减工业生产。因此，据匈牙利公布的材料，估计今年内将有十万或二十万劳动者的工作要受到影响。由于裁减机构的结果，也将有大批职员受到解雇。同时，由于工业的减产，农业所需要的各种机器和农具的供应，也不能不受到一定的影响。在这种情况下，恢复生产，特别是恢复煤的生产，消除通货膨胀的威胁和安排救济失业者，已成为匈牙利工农革命政府目前一件十分艰巨的工作。
    工农革命政府就匈牙利当前最重要的任务所发表的声明中，已经为解决目前的经济困难制定了一些临时的措施。这些措施的实施和各兄弟国家的支援，将逐渐克服匈牙利在经济方面所遇到的困难，而经济情况的好转也将促使国内政治情况更加趋向稳定。
