    Arong Banner Bags More Than 30,000 Pheasants
    (By our correspondent) To increase sideline income, members of agricultural cooperatives in Arong Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, have been actively hunting pheasants since the beginning of last winter. According to statistics from just over two months, the banner has already bagged more than 31,700 pheasants, worth more than 20,830 yuan in RMB. Agricultural cooperative members across the banner are still continuing to hunt.
    Pheasant meat is very delicious. Every year, in addition to being supplied to the people of our country, it is also sold abroad.

    阿荣旗打山鸡三万多只
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区阿荣旗农业社社员，为了增加副业收入，从去年入冬以来，即积极捕打山鸡。仅据两个多月的统计，全旗已捕打山鸡三万一千七百多只，折合人民币两万零八百三十多元。现在，全旗农业社社员仍在继续捕打中。
    山鸡肉十分鲜美。每年除供国内人民食用外，还运销国外。
