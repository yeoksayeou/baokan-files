    Hong'an County Party Secretary Leads Cadres Deep into the Fields
    (Xinhua News Agency) The secretaries of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Hong'an County Committee in Hubei Province took the lead in going down to the fields, promoting the winter production campaign in agricultural cooperatives.
    Hong'an County's grain and oil crops in 1956 increased significantly compared to previous years. After the autumn harvest, cadres from the county to the township level were generally intoxicated by the bumper harvest, spending their days in meetings and unwilling to go deeper. Many townships closed their doors to carry out rectification and consolidation of cooperatives, without asking about production. The cadres had so-called "three willingnesses and three unwillingnesses": willing to go to advanced cooperatives, unwilling to go to backward cooperatives; willing to sit in the office, unwilling to go to the fields for production; willing to deal with cooperative cadres, unwilling to do in-depth work among the masses. As a result, many agricultural cooperatives experienced a situation of "four increases and one decrease": more people wandering the streets, more people handling private matters, more people engaging in sideline occupations, more people basking in the sun; fewer people participating in agricultural production. The farmland appeared deserted. The Lianjian Cooperative in Yonghe Township, which originally had very good production, once inspected the activities of its members for a day. Among the 170 households, 30 were gathering firewood and making fire, 24 were preparing for the New Year, and 13 were fishing and helping people knit socks. According to preliminary statistics for the county, since the beginning of winter, only a little over 1,500 ponds and dams have been started, accounting for 38% of the original plan, fertilizer accumulation has not reached half of the plan, and many wheat and rapeseed fields have not been weeded or top-dressed.
    In order to further implement the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the CCP Hong'an County Committee is determined to leave the office and jump out of the meeting circle. With the exception of a few people staying behind to maintain the work of the office, the county party secretary, committee members, and more than 300 cadres have gone to the countryside in separate groups to help agricultural cooperatives carry out winter production. In Chihe Township, there had been no thorough rain since the autumn harvest, and the rapeseed seedlings did not emerge evenly. The members had watered them twice, but they still did not come out, and everyone was very discouraged. After Zhang Jingtian, deputy secretary of the county party committee, went deep into the fields, he discovered that the water had not been thoroughly applied. He and a dozen members carried water together to water them again. As a result, the entire township also began to move, forming a mass anti-drought campaign. Xinghua Township had only accumulated 150,000 dan of fertilizer, and only two ponds and dams were under construction. The wheat and rapeseed seedlings were yellow and thin. After Cheng Peng, secretary of the county party committee, discovered this situation, he organized township and cooperative cadres to inspect the fields and helped the Wufanggong production team of the Jiansu Cooperative to formulate a production plan, arrange public and private work, and revise labor quotas, setting an example, and then organized cadres from agricultural cooperatives throughout the township to visit the site. Some township cadres who had rarely gone to the fields in the past took the lead in repairing ponds and plowing fields after visiting. In this way, the winter production activities in the entire township quickly became active. In just three days, 620 ponds and dams were under construction in the township, and more than 80,000 dan of fertilizer were accumulated. Most of the winter crops were also cultivated.

    红安县委书记带领干部深入田间
    据新华社讯　中共湖北省红安县委的书记们带头下田，推动了农业社的冬季生产运动。
    红安县1956年的粮食和油料作物比往年增产很多。秋收后，从县到乡的干部们普遍为大丰收所陶醉，整天忙着开会，不愿再深入下去。许多乡关着门整风整社，不问生产。干部们存在着所谓“三愿三不愿”：愿到先进的社，不愿到落后的社；愿坐在屋里办公，不愿到田间生产；愿和社干部打交道，不愿做深入群众的工作。这样，就使许多农业社出现了“四多一少”的情况：逛街的多，办私事的多，搞副业的多，晒太阳的多；参加农业生产的少。农田里显得冷冷落落。原先生产很不错的永河乡联建社，曾经检查了社员一天的活动。在一百七十户社员中，有三十户打柴烤火，二十四户办年货，十三户捕鱼和帮人织袜子。据全县初步统计，入冬以来，开工的塘堰只有一千五百多处，占原计划的38％，积肥没达到计划的一半，许多小麦和油菜地没有锄草，也没有追肥。
    中共红安县委员会为了进一步贯彻党的八届二中全会的精神，决心走出办公室，跳出会议圈子，除了留下少数人坚持机关工作以外，县委书记、委员以及三百多名干部分头深入农村，帮助农业社开展冬季生产。翅合乡从秋收到现在没有下透雨，油菜苗出不齐，社员们点了两次水也没有出来，大家很丧气。县委副书记张景田深入田间后，发现原来是水没有点透，他就和十来个社员一起挑水再点，这样，全乡也都跟着动了起来，形成了群众性的抗旱运动。杏花乡只积了十五万担肥料，塘堰只有两处动工，麦苗和油菜又黄又瘦。县委书记程鹏发现这个情况以后，一面组织乡社干部到田间检查，一面又帮助建苏社五房岗生产队制定生产计划，安排公私活路，修正劳动定额，作出榜样，再组织全乡农业社干部到现场参观。有些一向很少下田的乡干部参观了以后，纷纷带头修塘犁田。这样，全乡的冬季生产活动就很快地活跃起来，只三天时间，这个乡就有六百二十处塘堰开工，并且积了八万多担肥，冬季作物也大部分进行了培育。
