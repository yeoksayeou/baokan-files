    In Karl Marx City
    Zhang Pei

    The Cradle of the German Workers' Movement
    Karl Marx City (Karl-Marx-Stadt in German), formerly known as Chemnitz, is one of the earliest birthplaces of the German workers' movement. When the French working class raised the revolutionary red flag in 1871 and established the first workers' regime—the Paris Commune—the workers here held mass rallies to support their French worker brothers. At the beginning of this century, the workers here had already organized, and during the Weimar Republic era after World War I, they held many large-scale strikes against the exploitation and enslavement of capitalists. Because of the strength of the working class, representatives of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party sat on the city council before 1933. In the long-term workers' movement, Chemnitz saw the emergence of a number of outstanding individuals, some of whom later became leaders of the German Communist Party. Even during Hitler's bloody rule, the Communist Party organizations in the city's factories never ceased their activities. Many of the workers working in the city now are veteran Communist Party members, some with forty or fifty years of history in the workers' movement. To commemorate the city's contribution to the socialist workers' movement, in 1953 the government of the German Democratic Republic decided to name the city after the world's proletarian teacher, Karl Marx.

    A Typical Industrial City
    When we arrived in the Karl Marx City area after a five-hour car journey from Zschopau, a small town famous for its toys, we felt that we had arrived in a typical industrial city. The streets we passed were lined with factories one after another. After the tool and machine factory was a textile factory, and after the textile factory was a motorcycle factory. Outside the factories were blocks of workers' residential areas.
    The next day, Comrade Barkmann, the city's vice-mayor, a 37-year-old former fitter, briefed us on the situation in this city with a long history of workers' movement.

    A city had already formed here in the mid-12th century, and by the 15th century, the city had developed textile and printing and dyeing industries. At that time, Karl Marx City was under the jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Saxony, so the city was known as "Saxon Manchester." However, the region did not have rich textile raw materials, and capitalists had to pay higher prices to import raw materials from abroad. In order to make up for the extra money they paid for raw materials, the capitalists came up with various ways to cruelly exploit the workers, which is one of the reasons why the workers' movement in Karl Marx City started so early. With the development of the textile industry, the need for textile machinery increased. Therefore, some large textile enterprises established textile machinery repair and manufacturing factories, which gradually developed into independent textile machinery manufacturing plants. Due to the prosperity of the textile machinery industry, the city's tool and machine manufacturing industry also developed along with it. Therefore, before the war, Karl Marx City had become a center of the textile industry (rayon, cotton spinning, underwear, gloves, etc.) and the machinery manufacturing industry (textile machinery, tool machines).

    Like many important cities in the German Democratic Republic, when Karl Marx City was about to become a people's city on March 5, 1945, American bombers destroyed 70% of the city in one day. Almost all factories were damaged, and 72,000 houses were destroyed. The intentions of the American generals were very clear, because they did not want these factories to become the property of the people, and they viciously bombed the city into ruins, attempting to create huge difficulties for the future people's regime. But the plans of the American imperialists failed. In just ten years, the factories here have not only been fully restored, but also their output has exceeded pre-war levels. Karl Marx City is currently an important industrial center in the German Democratic Republic, with a population of more than 300,000, of which more than 170,000 are employees, and the rest are their families. The cars, motorcycles, typewriters, computers, and tool machines produced in the city have a high reputation in the world market.

    Production of Private Enterprises
    Private enterprises still exist in considerable numbers in the German Democratic Republic, and they continue to produce as usual. In the total industrial output value of Karl Marx City, private enterprises account for 28.6%, and among the more than 170,000 employees, 50,000 work in private enterprises. How does the government manage these private industrial and commercial enterprises? According to the conversation between Vice-Mayor Barkmann and us, the management and leadership are roughly carried out in the following aspects: The state has specialized management agencies in each administrative region, mainly to allocate raw materials to private industries. Some private factories have contracts with state-owned factories, obtaining raw materials from state-owned factories and handing over their products to state-owned factories according to the contracts. Some private factories have contracts with state-owned commercial enterprises, which is somewhat similar to processing orders in our country. The prices of all products are determined by the state, and private industrial and commercial enterprises pay taxes according to the state tax system.

    Vice-Mayor Barkmann mentioned in the conversation that the city already had the first joint state-private enterprise. We were very interested in it and eager to visit this enterprise. Comrade Barkmann was very enthusiastic, and he took us to the enterprise the next afternoon. Mr. Wassbau, a capitalist in his forties, received us in the factory's reception room. He answered in detail some of the questions we raised: the history of the factory, the form of joint operation, etc.

    The factory was founded in 1911 by the Wassbau brothers (namely, Wassbau's father and uncle who talked to us), so the factory is named "Wassbau Brothers Factory." At that time, the factory mainly produced heating equipment. Now, in addition to heating equipment, the factory also produces chemical industrial equipment and weighing scales. The factory currently has 240 employees, and some of its products are exported abroad.

    The form of joint operation is that the state invests and distributes profits according to the proportion of capital, and signs product contracts with state-owned factories. The original capital of this factory was 200,000 marks, and the state invested 115,000 marks, but the state does not send anyone to manage the factory, and the entire factory is still managed by the original capitalists. The state also pays each of the two factory directors a salary of 1,500 marks per month, which can also be called management fees.

    When we visited, this factory had just been jointly operated for two weeks. The capitalist felt very satisfied with the current situation. Wassbau finally told the reporter: "My friends in West Germany are also very interested in this kind of joint operation."

    Visiting the Computer Factory
    We had heard that the computers of the German Democratic Republic were of world-class level. Therefore, we visited this factory with great interest. The factory director personally accompanied us to the workshop. Like many factories in Germany, the factory building is not flat, but three-dimensional. We looked at it floor by floor in order. Unlike other mechanical factories, there was no rumbling noise here. The workshop was very quiet because the workers were mainly producing some delicate and small parts. A typewriter computer that can be placed on a table requires 17,000 parts, and the internal device structure is very complicated. We watched until the last workshop for printing trademarks, but we laymen could not figure out its structure and the principle of the device. Later, the factory director led us to the sample room, where several brands of typewriter computers were placed. A girl in white gave us a demonstration on the spot. The machine was very dexterous and the form was also very beautiful.

    The factory director told us: 80% of the typewriter computers produced by this factory are exported abroad. Of the 3,400 workers in the factory, 650 are members of the Socialist Unity Party, and female workers account for more than 40%. Twelve workers in the factory are model inventors and have received national awards.

    Because the production of such complex computers requires not only sufficient experts, but also special attention to the training of apprentices. The factory administration has a department for apprentice training, as well as an apprentice school, where hundreds of male and female students who have graduated from the eight-year system study for three years before going to work in the factory.

    This factory undertakes a great task. In the new five-year plan, it is necessary to increase production by 130% and complete the task of researching and manufacturing electronic computers assigned by the government.

    The New Look of the City
    To restore a city that has been 70% destroyed, one can imagine that there are many difficulties, but the workers of Karl Marx City have constantly overcome these difficulties. In the early days of recovery, steel was in severe shortage, so the workers and residents of the city launched a campaign to collect waste steel and scrap iron to help the government overcome difficulties. In order to restore tens of thousands of destroyed houses, in addition to large-scale government investment, the workers of the city also actively participated in voluntary labor to help clear the ruins and pick out usable bricks and stones from the rubble. Voluntary labor has continued to this day. Vice-Mayor Barkmann led us to a voluntary labor site to see. It was originally a destroyed hotel, and now it is being prepared to be built into an open-air theater. Unfortunately, it was not yet off-work time, and we were unable to see the enthusiastic labor scene.

    With the joint efforts of the government and the people, Karl Marx City has undergone tremendous changes. The factory has not only been restored but also developed. It is more beautiful than the old city. In the capitalist era, this city, which concentrated workers, had no cultural and welfare facilities for workers. But now a magnificent and grand workers' cultural palace has been built. Opposite the green cultural palace square filled with flowers is a gymnasium with modern equipment. We came to this cultural palace on Sunday. Several cars and dozens of motorcycles were parked next to the square. These all belonged to the workers. Many people sat quietly in the coffee shop next to the cultural palace to rest and talk.

    In the center of the city is a palace lake, which is a large park shaded by green trees. In the center of the lake, there are several large fountains, and游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡游荡

    在卡尔·马克思城
    张沛
    德国工人运动的故乡
    卡尔·马克思城（在德文中称为卡尔·马克思斯塔特）原名凯木尼茨，是德国工人运动最早的发源地之一。当1871年法国的工人阶级高举革命的红旗，建立起第一个工人政权——巴黎公社的时候，这里的工人们曾举行群众大会声援法国的工人兄弟们。本世纪初，这里的工人就已组织起来，在第一次世界大战以后魏玛共和国时代，曾经举行过多次反对资本家的剥削和奴役的大罢工。因为工人阶级的力量强大，所以在1933年以前，这里的市政府里就有共产党和社会民主党的代表。凯木尼茨在长期的工人运动中，涌现出一批优秀分子，其中有一些后来成为德国共产党的领导人。即使在希特勒血腥统治时期，城里工厂的共产党组织也一直没有停止过活动。现在本城工作的工人中有很多老共产党员，他们有些有四、五十年参加工人运动的历史。为了纪念这个城市对社会主义工人运动的贡献，所以在1953年民主德国政府决定以世界无产阶级导师卡尔·马克思的名字为本城的名字。
    典型的工业城市
    当我们从以玩具出名的小城日列贝尔克，经过五个小时的汽车旅程进入卡尔·马克思市区的时候，我们感觉出来已经到了一个典型的工业城市。我们经过的几条大街，工厂一个接着一个，工具机器厂刚过去是纺织厂，纺织厂过去又是摩托制造厂。工厂以外是一幢幢工人宿舍的住宅区。
    第二天，本城的钳工出身三十七岁的副市长巴尔克曼同志，向我们介绍了这个有着悠久的工人运动历史的城市的情况。
    在十二世纪的中叶，这里已经形成了城市，十五世纪以后，城里就有了发达的纺织工业和印染工业。那时卡尔·马克思城归萨克逊王国管辖，所以城市有“萨克逊的曼彻斯特”之称。可是这个地区并没有丰富的纺织原料，资本家必须花较高的代价从国外进口原料，资本家为了弥补他们在原料方面多付出的钱，就想出各种办法残酷的剥削工人，这也是卡尔·马克思城工人运动开始得很早的一个原因。随着纺织工业的发展，对纺织机械的需要日益增加。因此一些大的纺织企业就附设了纺织机械的修造工厂，这些工厂以后慢慢发展为独立的纺织机械制造厂。由于纺织机械工业的繁荣，本城的工具机器制造业也随着发展起来。因此在战前，卡尔·马克思城已成为纺织工业（人造丝、棉纺、内衣、手套等）与机器制造业（纺织机器、工具机器）的中心。
    像民主德国许多重要城市一样，当1945年3月5日，卡尔·马克思城即将成为人民的城市的时候，美国轰炸机在一天之间，把城市毁灭了70％。几乎所有的工厂均受到了破坏，七万二千套住宅被毁了。美国将军们的用意非常明显，因为他们不愿意这些工厂成为人民的财产，他们穷凶极恶地把这个城市炸成废墟，企图给未来的人民政权造成巨大困难。可是美国帝国主义分子的打算落空了，仅仅经过了十年，这里的工厂不仅全部恢复了，而且产量超过了战前。卡尔·马克思城目前是民主德国一个重要的工业中心，全市三十多万人口，职工占十七万多人，其余是他们的家属。本城出产的汽车摩托、打字机与计算机、工具机器在世界市场上都有很高的信誉。
    私营企业的生产
    私营企业在民主德国仍有相当数量，他们照常地进行生产。在卡尔·马克思城的全部工业产值中，私营企业占28.6％，十七万多职工中，有五万人在私营企业工作。政府怎样管理这些私营工商业呢？根据副市长巴尔克曼同志和我们的谈话，大致从这几方面来管理领导：国家在每个行政区设有专门的管理机构，主要是为私营工业分配原料。一部分私营工厂和国营工厂订有合同，按照合同从国营工厂取得原料并把生产品交给国营工厂。一部分私营工厂和国营商业订有合同，有点类似我国的加工订货。所有产品的价格由国家决定，私营工商业按照国家税制纳税。
    副市长巴尔克曼同志在谈话中提到本城已经有了第一个公私合营的企业，我们听了很感兴趣，极想去访问一下这个企业。巴尔克曼同志非常热心，第二天下午他带我们来到这个企业。四十多岁的资本家瓦斯保在工厂会客室里接待我们。他详细答复了我们提出的一些问题：工厂的历史、合营的形式等等。
    这个工厂是1911年老瓦斯保兄弟（即和我们谈话的瓦斯保的父亲和伯伯）创办的，所以厂名即叫“瓦斯保兄弟工厂”。当时工厂主要生产暖气设备，现在工厂除生产暖气设备外，还生产化学工业设备及磅秤。工厂现有二百四十个职工，产品有些还向国外出口。
    合营的形式是国家投资，按资金比例分配利润，与国营工厂订产品合同。这个工厂原来的资金是二十万马克，国家投资了十一万五千马克，但是国家不派人来，整个工厂仍由原来的资本家管理，国家并发给两个厂长每人每月一千五百个马克的工资或者叫做管理费。
    我们去时，这个工厂刚刚合营两个星期。资本家对目前状况感觉非常满意，瓦斯保最后告诉记者说：“我的西德的朋友们对这种合营也非常感兴趣。”
    访问计算机工厂
    我们早就听说民主德国的计算机是有世界水平的。因此我们怀着强烈的兴趣来参观这个工厂。厂长亲自陪我们到车间去。像德国许多工厂一样，厂房不是平面的，而是立体的。我们一层一层楼顺序看上去。这里不像其它的机械工厂有隆隆的声响，车间里很安静，因为工人们主要在生产一些精致小巧的零件。一部可以放在桌子上的打字计算机，需要一万七千个零件，内部的装置结构非常复杂。我们一直看完最后一个印制商标的车间，但是我们这些外行无法弄清楚它的结构和装置的原理。以后厂长把我们领到样品间去，这里放着几种牌子的打字计算机，一个穿白衣的姑娘当场给我们表演，机器非常灵巧而且形式也很美观。
    厂长告诉我们：这个工厂生产的打字计算机有80％向国外出口。全厂三千四百个工人中有六百五十个统一社会党党员，女工占40％以上。工厂有十二个工人是功勋发明家，得到了国家的奖励。
    因为生产这种复杂的计算机，除了要有足够的专家外，工厂还特别注意对学徒的训练。工厂行政设有学徒训练的部门，还有一个学徒学校，几百个八年制毕业的男女学生在这里学习三年再到工厂去做工。
    这个工厂担负着很大的任务，在新的五年计划里要把生产提高130％，而且要完成政府交下的研究制造电子计算机的任务。
    城市的新面貌
    要想恢复一个被毁了70％的城市，可以想像困难是很多的，但是卡尔·马克思城的工人不断地战胜了这些困难。恢复初期，钢铁严重缺乏，于是全市的工人、居民发起了搜集废钢废铁的运动，帮助政府克服困难。为了恢复几万套被破坏的住宅，除了政府大量投资以外，本城的工人还积极参加义务劳动，帮助铲除废墟，从断瓦残垣中拣出可用的砖石。义务劳动一直坚持到现在，副市长巴尔克曼领我们到一个义务劳动工地上去看，这里原来是一个被炸毁的旅馆，现在准备修成露天剧场。可惜当时还不到下班时间，我们没有能够看到热烈的劳动场面。
    在政府和人民通力合作下，卡尔·马克思城已经发生了巨大的变化。工厂不仅恢复了而且发展了。它比旧的城市更美丽了。在资本主义时代，这个工人集中的城市没有什么工人的文化福利设施。可是现在一座壮丽宏伟的工人文化宫建立起来了，在开满鲜花的绿色的文化宫广场对面，是一座拥有近代设备的体育馆。我们是在星期天来到这个文化宫的，广场旁边停着几辆汽车和几十辆机器脚踏车，这些都是工人的。许多人安静地坐在文化宫旁边的咖啡店休息谈天。
    在城市的中心有一个宫殿湖，这是一个绿荫蔽天的大公园，湖中心有着几股大喷泉，在水花四射的湖面上，荡漾着一只只游船。在湖的旁边，一座新的音乐厅刚刚竣工。在公园附近新修了一条儿童铁路，还有运动场和跳伞塔。巴尔克曼同志指着对面的小山说：一个更大的文化休息公园就要在这里建设。
    我们只在卡尔·马克思城住了两天，但是我们到处感觉得到，这个城市正同它的名字一样，充满着无限的生命力，在社会主义的道路上大步前进。
