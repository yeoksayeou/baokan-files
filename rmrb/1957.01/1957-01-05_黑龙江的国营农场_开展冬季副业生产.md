    Heilongjiang's State-owned Farms
    Carry Out Winter Sideline Production
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The winter sideline production of more than thirty state-owned farms in Heilongjiang Province has been fully launched. In addition to production preparation work, all the winter idle labor force of the farms has been put into winter sideline production. Now, four to five thousand employees, more than a thousand horses, and a large number of cars, horse-drawn carriages, and tractors, braving the severe cold of minus thirty degrees Celsius, have successively entered the Xing'anling forest area, covered with white snow. According to the locations and requirements designated by the forestry department, they are clearing fallen and standing dead trees, and it is estimated that more than 60,000 cubic meters of forest trees will be cleared. After each farm clears the forest farm, the fallen and standing dead trees can be used as materials for constructing staff dormitories and livestock sheds. In this way, not only can the cost of building timber be reduced by more than half, but also a large amount of winter idle labor can be utilized, which can reduce agricultural costs.
    Many farms have also developed other sideline businesses in accordance with local conditions. The Daxi Jiang Farm, on the one hand, is carrying out work such as quarrying stones, cutting tree branches, and digging sand, and on the other hand, it has formed a fishing team to break the ice and fish in the nearby Nenjiang River and lakes and ponds. The "Eleventh" Farm suffered from natural disasters last year, and it is estimated that it will lose more than 120,000 yuan. The farm leaders mobilized the workers to collect all the farm's rice straw and sell more than 4,000 tons, which generated an income of 120,000 yuan. (Ding Lüshu)

    黑龙江的国营农场
    开展冬季副业生产
    本报讯　黑龙江省三十多个国营农场的冬季副业生产已经全面展开。各农场除了进行生产准备工作以外的冬闲人工，全部投入冬季副业生产。现在四五千职工、千余匹马和大批汽车、马车、拖拉机，冒着零下三十多度的严寒，先后进入遍地白雪的兴安岭林区，按照林业部门指定的地点和要求，清理站干倒木，预计将清理林木六万多立方公尺。各场清理林场后，可以用站干倒木做建筑职工宿舍和畜舍的材料。这样，不仅可以降低建筑木材费用一倍以上，而且大量利用了冬闲人工，可以降低农业成本。
    许多农场还因地制宜地开展了其他一些副业。大西江农场，一方面进行打石头、割树条、挖砂子等工作，一方面组成捕鱼队，在附近的嫩江上和湖泊池塘上破冰捕鱼。“十一”农场去年由于受到自然灾害，预计约亏损十二万余元。农场领导人员动员职工们把农场的稻草全部收集起来卖出四千多吨，就收入了十二万元。　（丁履枢）
