Why Tear Down Newly Built Houses?

Editor:

The Chengdu Department Store Wholesale Station recently spent nearly 30,000 yuan repairing houses covering more than 2,000 square meters on North Dajin Street, including employee dormitories, bathrooms, canteens, and offices, which could accommodate more than 200 people. However, before the plaster was even dry and without a single day of use, the Municipal Bureau of Commerce sent people on December 19, 1956, to tear them down, planning to use the foundation here to build a state-owned commercial joint office building.

Why did the Chengdu Municipal Bureau of Commerce do this? The responsible comrades of the bureau put forward three reasons: (1) The Chengdu commercial system companies have increased many personnel this year, and need dormitories and offices; (2) There is money, and the higher authorities stipulate that 75% of the profits from joint state-private commercial ventures can be used by the Bureau of Commerce for expenses, and can also be used for capital construction; (3) The construction address was determined late, so it was built and then demolished.

In fact, according to my understanding from various relevant parties, the companies under the Bureau of Commerce do not urgently need houses. Although the number of personnel in the Chengdu commercial system increased significantly last year, a considerable amount of state capital construction investment, joint state-private profits, and major repair costs have already been spent on building offices and dormitories, and further adjustments and repairs can largely meet the needs. However, to build new houses that are not urgently needed, the newly built dormitories and welfare facilities that can accommodate 200 people are being demolished, and 26 private houses will also be demolished. The losses from relocation fees, repair costs, and the demolition of old houses alone will be more than 70,000 yuan. According to the construction unit, these demolished old houses could have been used for at least fifteen years.

Of course, according to the regulations of the Central Ministry of Commerce, the Chengdu Municipal Bureau of Commerce can control and spend a portion of the profits from joint state-private ventures, but this does not mean that it can be arbitrarily wasted, spending the money on construction that is not urgently needed. This incident occurred after the spirit of the Second Plenary Session was conveyed, which is even more inappropriate.

### 新修的房子为什么拆掉

    新修的房子为什么拆掉
    编辑同志：
    成都市百货批发站不久前花了近三万元在北打金街培修了约二千多平方公尺的房屋，有职工宿舍、浴室、食堂、办公室等，可供两百多人使用。可是泥土未干，一天未用，市商业局在1956年12月19日就派人拆掉，准备用这里的地基修一座国营商业联合办公大楼。
    成都市商业局为什么要这样做呢？这个局的负责同志提出了三个理由：（一）成都商业系统各公司今年增加了许多人员，需要宿舍和办公室；（二）有钱，上级规定，公私合营商业利润可以抽75％由商业局掌握开支，并可用作基本建设；（三）建筑地址确定的迟，所以修了又拆。
    实际上，据我从各有关方面了解，商业局所属各公司并不迫切需要房屋。去年成都市商业系统虽然人员增加较多，但已经花了不少国家基本建设投资、公私合营利润以及大修理费等，用于修建办公室和宿舍，再通过调剂、培修，可以大体满足需要。而现在为修建并不迫切需要的新房，却拆掉可供两百人使用的刚刚修好的宿舍和福利设施，还要拆去二十六家民房，单搬迁费、培修费和拆掉旧房，损失就在七万元以上。据修建单位谈，拆去的这些旧房至少还可以使用十五年。
    当然，根据中央商业部的规定，成都市商业局对公私合营利润的一部分，是可以由自己掌握开支的，但是这并不等于说可以任意浪费，把钱用在不是迫切需要的修建上面。这件事发生在二中全会精神传达以后，更是不应该的。　贾　明
