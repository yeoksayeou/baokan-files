Correctly View the Rural Free Market

The state-led rural free market has been opened in many parts of the country one after another. Over the past few months, cadres at all levels, urban and rural people have had more or less contact with the free market, and some different views and opinions have emerged. Some people say the free market is doing well, some say it is not; some say opening the free market is right, some say opening it is not right. So how should this issue be viewed? Does opening the rural free market bring more benefits or more harms to the country and the people? How should the rural free market be correctly viewed?

After the opening of the rural free market, some problems have indeed occurred: the number of "unlicensed vendors" in the market has increased significantly. Phenomena such as adulteration, short measures, price gouging, and speculation, which have been rarely seen in recent years, have begun to reappear. A small number of organized small traders have requested to withdraw from cooperative groups. Some members of agricultural cooperatives plan to abandon farming and engage in commerce. Consumers are dissatisfied with the increased prices of certain commodities in short supply in the free market. Some staff members of state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives feel that their work has become more difficult after the opening of the free market. Therefore, some people say that the policy of opening the rural free market is wrong.

So, is opening the rural free market suitable for our country's situation, can it promote the development of production, and does it have benefits? The task of socialist transformation in our country has been basically completed, and the socialist economy has an absolute dominant position in industry, agriculture, handicraft industry, and commerce. The lives of the people across the country have been improved to a certain extent. However, our country is a large multi-ethnic country with a population of 600 million, with a vast territory and extremely complex geographical and climatic conditions, producing a large number of diverse products every year. Due to the differences in economic conditions and customs in various regions, people have many different needs in addition to certain basic common needs. Therefore, how to concentrate and distribute the diverse products produced in various regions to meet the needs of production and consumption has become a very important issue.

In the first few years after liberation, the socialist economy was surrounded by capitalism and the individual economy. At that time, the fundamental task of the state and the fundamental interests of the people were to realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicraft industry, and capitalist industry and commerce. Therefore, the state had to take appropriate measures to restrict private merchants from purchasing and transporting goods in market management. These measures played a positive role in stabilizing prices, ensuring supply, and realizing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. However, at that time, overly strict and rigid market management brought some side effects. For example, some agricultural and sideline products produced by the masses, especially some small local products, were once reduced in production because state-owned and supply and marketing cooperative businesses were unable to purchase them or the purchase prices were not entirely reasonable, and some people wanted to buy these things but could not. In order to realize the fundamental task of socialist transformation, the people could endure this temporary inconvenience. However, now that the country has achieved a decisive victory in socialist transformation, it would be very wrong to continue to let the masses endure this inconvenience and to allow the production of some small local products to continue to fail to recover and develop.

The time of opening the rural free market is not very long now, but its benefits are very obvious. For example, after Wuhan City opened the suburban free market, urban and rural trade became significantly more active. In November of last year, the number of farmers and merchants from other places coming to the city to sell goods increased five times compared with July before the opening of the free market, and the transaction volume increased twelve times. Market prices are basically stable. Because production and sales directly meet, business links are reduced, and the income of farmers selling products has increased, which has powerfully stimulated their enthusiasm for production. State-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives are actively improving their management work in the new situation of opening the rural free market. The Dried and Fresh Fruit Management Department of Wuhan City Supply and Marketing Cooperative has always maintained a proportion of about 78% in market wholesale, which guarantees the stability of dried and fresh fruit market prices. These facts fully illustrate that opening the rural free market has played a great role in promoting and stimulating the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, stimulating the production of agricultural and sideline products, and improving the management of state-owned and supply and marketing cooperative businesses. Many other regional examples prove that after the opening of the rural free market, the vast number of farmers have found it much more convenient to freely purchase daily consumer goods. That is to say, the rural free market has direct benefits for consumers.

However, will opening the rural free market re-emerge the threat of capitalism? We believe that because the free market we have opened is a state-led free market restricted to a certain scope. What commodities are opened and what commodities are not opened are determined by the state according to the socialist economy and the needs of the people. According to the state's regulations, the commodities currently open are mainly some small local products that state-owned and supply and marketing cooperative businesses have no possibility of fully operating, as well as non-suitable unified purchase and marketing of vegetables, chickens, ducks, and other non-staple foods. The total value of the opened commodities is only about one-third of the total value of national agriculture and agricultural by-products. State-owned and supply and marketing cooperative businesses still have the responsibility to control the source of goods and stabilize the market for this part of the commodities. This eliminates the possibility of capitalist proliferation. However, it cannot be denied that after the opening of the rural free market, due to the unclear policy thinking and lack of experience of some cadres, some shortcomings and errors have occurred in the work, enabling individual small traders to illegally seek profits and wealth, and even develop some exploitative capitalist nature. In the future, these shortcomings and errors in the work must be resolutely corrected. For the illegal activities of individual illegal merchants, all localities should take necessary measures in accordance with the law. Education should also be strengthened for the vast number of farmers, so that they can fully understand the state's policy on the rural free market, actively maintain the order of the rural free market, and expose and report all illegal activities. The vast number of farmers should play a supervisory role in the rural free market, so that the rural free market will truly benefit farmers without harming the interests of farmers and the country.

We must fully recognize the positive role of opening the rural free market, and also adequately estimate the shortcomings and errors that have already occurred. Only in this way can we better promote achievements, correct shortcomings, and do this work better.

### 正确看待农村自由市场

    正确看待农村自由市场
    国家领导的农村自由市场，在全国许多地方先后开放了。几个月来，各级干部、城乡人民和自由市场发生了或多或少的接触，已经产生了某些不同的看法和意见。有人说自由市场办的很好，有人说办的不好；有人说自由市场开放对了，有人说开放的并不对。到底应该怎样认识这个问题？开放农村自由市场对国家对人民究竟是好处多还是坏处多？对于农村自由市场究竟应该怎样正确看待呢？
    开放农村自由市场以后，的确发生了一些问题：市场上“无证商贩”显著地增加了。几年来很少看到的掺假、短秤、抬价收购、投机倒把的现象又开始发现了。少数已经组织起来的小商贩要求退出合作小组。某些农业社的社员打算弃农经商。消费者不满意自由市场上某些供不应求的商品提高了价格。某些国营商业和供销社的工作人员感到开放自由市场以后工作更难作了。因此，有人说开放农村自由市场的这个方针是错误的。
    那末，究竟开放农村自由市场是否适合我们国家的情况，是否能够推动生产的发展，是否有好处呢？我国社会主义改造的任务已经基本完成，社会主义经济已经在工业、农业、手工业和商业中居于绝对统治的地位，全国人民的生活有了一定程度的提高和改善。但是，我国是一个拥有六亿人口的多民族的大国，幅员广大，地理和气候条件极为复杂，每年生产大量的、多种多样的物产。由于各个地区经济条件和风俗习惯的差别，人们除了某些基本的相同的需要以外，又有很多千差万别的需要。因此，怎样把各个地区生产的多种多样的产品集中起来，分配出去，满足生产和消费的需要，就成为一个十分重要的问题。
    在解放后的几年以内，社会主义经济曾经处在资本主义和个体经济的包围中。当时国家的根本任务，人民的根本利益，是实现农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。因此，国家在市场管理上，不得不采取适当限制私商采购和贩运的措施。这种措施对于稳定物价、保证供应、实现对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，起了积极的作用。但是在当时，由于对市场管理过严过死，曾经带来一些副作用。比如，群众所生产的某些农副产品，特别是某些小土产品，由于国营和供销合作社商业无力收购，或者收购价格不尽合理，曾经一度减产，有些群众想买这些东西却买不到。为了实现社会主义改造这个根本任务，人民可以忍受这种暂时的不方便。但是，当着国家取得了社会主义改造决定性的胜利以后，让群众继续忍受这种不方便，让一部分小土产的生产继续不能恢复、发展，这就很不应该了。
    现在开放农村自由市场的时间还不很久，它的好处却看得很明显了。例如，武汉市在开放郊区自由市场以后，城乡贸易显著地活跃起来。去年11月份，农民和外地商贩到市内出售商品的人，比开放自由市场以前的7月份增加五倍，交易额增加十二倍。市场价格基本上是稳定的。由于产销直接见面，经营环节减少，农民出卖产品的收入增加了，这就有力地刺激了他们的生产积极性。国营商业和供销合作社，在开放农村自由市场的新情况下，正在积极改善自己的经营管理工作。武汉市供销合作社干鲜果经理部在市场批发比重中，始终保持在78％左右，这就保证了干鲜果市场价格的稳定。这些事实充分说明，开放农村自由市场，对于活跃城乡物资交流、刺激农副业生产、改善国营和供销社商业的经营管理，都起了很大的推动和刺激作用。还有许多地区的例子证明，在开放农村自由市场以后，广大农民对日常消费品的自由购买方便得多了。这就是说，农村自由市场对于消费者有直接的好处。
    然而，开放农村自由市场会不会重新产生资本主义的威胁呢？我们认为，由于我们所开放的自由市场，是国家领导下的、限制在一定范围内的自由市场。开放什么商品，不开放什么商品，是由国家根据社会主义经济和人民需要来决定的。根据国家的规定，目前开放的商品，主要是国营、供销社商业没有可能充分经营的一部分小土产品，以及不宜于统购包销的蔬菜、鸡鸭等副食品。开放的商品的总值，不过约占全国农业和农业副产品总值的三分之一。国营、供销社商业对于这一部分商品，仍然有责任掌握货源、稳定市场。这就杜绝了资本主义泛滥的可能性。但是，也不能否认，在开放农村自由市场以后，由于某些干部的政策思想不明确和缺乏经验，在工作中产生了一些缺点和错误，使个别小商贩得以非法谋利致富，甚至发展了某些资本主义性质的剥削。今后对于工作中的这些缺点和错误必须坚决加以纠正。对于个别不法商贩的违法行为，各地应该依法予以必要的处理。对于广大的农民也应该加强教育，使他们充分了解国家对于农村自由市场的政策，积极地维持农村自由市场的秩序，揭发和检举一切违法的行为。广大农民应该对农村自由市场起监督的作用，使农村自由市场真正便利于农民，而不危害农民群众和国家的利益。
    我们要充分认识开放农村自由市场的积极作用，也要足够地估计已经产生的某些缺点和错误。只有这样，才能很好地发扬成绩，纠正缺点，把这个工作做得更好。
