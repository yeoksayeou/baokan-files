Site of Li and Wen's Martyrdom
　　Kang Geng
　　West of Qingyun Street, on Xicang Slope
　　Countless passersby come and go
　　The fragrant soil, unknowingly,
　　The setting sun in the west wind freely shines.

The spots where Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo were martyred in Kunming, the two pools of blood, are still vaguely visible, but not many people recognize them anymore. It is sincerely hoped that temporary stone tablets can be erected at each site, to aid in identification, so that passersby will know where to pay their respects and love. I wonder what the relevant authorities think?

    李闻殉国处
    康庚青云街侧西仓坡无数行人来去过泥土芬香浑不识西风夕照任婆娑
    昆明李公朴闻一多殉国处，鲜血两滩，至今隐约在目，而识者已不甚多。甚望能暂时各立石碑一块，借资识别，使行人知所敬爱。不识有关方面以为何如？
