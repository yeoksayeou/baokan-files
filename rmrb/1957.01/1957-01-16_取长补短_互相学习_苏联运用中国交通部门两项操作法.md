Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 15th: The Soviet transportation departments are paying attention to and applying new working methods from related Chinese departments.

On the Samara River near Hongjun Village in the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast of Ukraine, a 250-meter-long highway bridge is under construction. The workers building the bridge are using the method of driving bridge piles without caissons, jointly created by Chinese and Soviet bridge experts and workers at the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. They have already started driving the pipes for the second bridge pile. This method involves driving large-diameter steel pipes into the riverbed without using expensive caissons and underwater operations, extracting the mud from the pipes, and then filling them with concrete.

This new method of building bridge pier foundations is being used for the first time in the Soviet Union. According to preliminary estimates, using this method to build this highway bridge will save one million rubles.

The sectional combustion method created by the stoker of the "Xinmin" ship of the China Yangtze River Shipping Administration has aroused great interest among Soviet sailors. The crew of the Soviet Far East port of Vladivostok ship "Kashirstroy" have already adopted this new combustion method. According to statistics from the ship's crew, using this new method significantly reduces coal consumption. The amount of unburned coal slag in the boiler has decreased from 3.7% to 5.2% to 1.5% to 2.5%. Even when the ship is sailing, fuel consumption is reduced by an average of 8.5%, and by 15% when carrying cargo. Because the sectional combustion method can maintain a balanced steam pressure, the power of the main engine is increased by one hundred horsepower. The labor intensity of the stoker is also greatly reduced.

Soviet sailors are also paying attention to developing and enriching the new methods of Chinese crew members when applying them. N. Vasilyev, a first-class stoker of the "Saratov" ship, changed to using coal containing a large amount of volatile matter for sectional combustion, and the effect was also very good.

### 取长补短　互相学习  苏联运用中国交通部门两项操作法

    取长补短　互相学习
    苏联运用中国交通部门两项操作法
    新华社莫斯科15日电　苏联交通运输部门重视和运用中国有关方面的新工作方法。
    在乌克兰第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克州红军村附近的萨马河上，正在建造一座长二百五十公尺的公路桥。建筑桥梁的工人们运用中国武汉长江大桥中苏桥梁专家和工人共同创造的不用沉箱打桥桩的方法，已经开始打第二根桥桩用的管子。这种方法是在打桥桩的时候不用费用很贵的沉箱和在水下作业，而把一些大口径的钢管打到水底，抽出管子里的泥浆，灌进混凝土。
    这种建筑桥墩基础的新方法，在苏联还是第一次运用。据初步估计，运用这个方法建筑这座公路桥将可节省一百万卢布。
    中国长江航运管理局“新民”号轮船的司炉创造的分段烧火法，已经引起苏联海员的极大兴趣。苏联远东海港海参崴的轮船“卡希尔斯特罗伊”号的船员们，已经采用了这个新的烧火法。据这只轮船的船员统计，运用这种新方法，大大节省了煤的损耗。锅炉内燃烧不透的煤滓量从3.7％到5.2％下降到1.5％到2.5％。就是在船只航行的时候，燃料的消耗量也平均减少了8.5％，在运货的时候减少了15％。由于分段烧火法能够保持蒸汽的压力平衡，主机的功能提高了一百匹马力。司炉的劳动强度也大大减轻了。
    苏联海员在运用中国船员的新方法的时候，也注意加以发展和充实。“萨拉托夫”号轮船的一级司炉尼·瓦西里耶夫，改用含有大量挥发分的煤来进行分段烧火的方法，效果也很好。
