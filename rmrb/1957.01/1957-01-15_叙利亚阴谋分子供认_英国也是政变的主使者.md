Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, January 14th: One of the conspirators who attempted to overthrow the current Syrian government by force with the support of foreign governments, Subhi al-Omari, a former Syrian parliamentarian, confessed in military court on the 13th that Britain sent former Syrian President Shishakli to Lebanon last year with the aim of launching a coup in Syria.

He said in court: "Britain once sent Shishakli to a British ship and wanted him to land in Latakia in northern Syria, but later, fearing that he would be arrested by the Syrian authorities, changed the destination to the coast of Lebanon."

    叙利亚阴谋分子供认
    英国也是政变的主使者
    据新华社14日讯　大马士革消息：在外国政府支持下企图以武力推翻叙利亚现政府的阴谋分子之一、叙利亚前议员苏卜希·奥马里13日在军事法庭上供认，英国去年把叙利亚前总统施舍克里送到黎巴嫩的目的是要在叙利亚发动政变。
    他在法庭上说：“英国曾经把施舍克里送到一艘英国船上，并且要让他在叙利亚北部的拉塔基亚上岸，但是后来因为担心他会被叙利亚当局逮捕，因此才把目的地改为黎巴嫩的海岸。”
