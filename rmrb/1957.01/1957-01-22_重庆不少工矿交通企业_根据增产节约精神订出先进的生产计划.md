Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 20th: Many industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises in Chongqing have formulated this year's production plans based on the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy.

The Chongqing Administration of the Coal Industry Department, in light of the rapid increase in coal consumption in Chongqing and Sichuan, decided to concentrate considerable funds and manpower on accelerating the construction of new mines about to go into production and the reconstruction and expansion of old mines when arranging this year's plan, while also making good use of the production potential of existing mines. In this way, this year's production plan of this administration will increase by 25% compared with the 1957 planned output stipulated in the original Five-Year Plan, and will increase by 280,000 tons compared with last year's output. The Chongqing Railway Administration, in summarizing last year's production and transportation work, believed that although the achievements were great, safety accidents were serious, with 610 train accidents occurring throughout the year. At the same time, the maintenance of lines and locomotives was not good, and the quality of transportation decreased significantly. These all affected the exertion of transportation potential. In view of these shortcomings, this administration focused on improving transportation quality and ensuring safety when formulating this year's plan, and put forward effective measures. In this way, the plan for the first quarter of this year alone will increase by 420,000 tons of freight and 150,000 passenger trips compared with the tasks assigned by the Ministry of Railways.

Some units whose plans were unrealistic have also revised their plans according to the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy. The Chongqing Power Plant's initial plan for this year was relatively perfunctory; recently, it reorganized its forces and conducted in-depth investigations and research on the potential of manpower and equipment, and then revised the plan. When the plant first formulated the plan, it believed that the labor force was insufficient and decided to add more than 50 management cadres. After a realistic investigation, it was found that there was waste in the use of labor in various workshops and departments, and it was decided to reduce the staffing and effectively use the labor force. The entire plant not only did not need to increase personnel, but instead reduced the labor force. In addition, according to the investigation and research, the plant reduced the consumption of plant electricity by more than 146,000 kWh and raw coal by several hundred tons, and cut investment in construction projects that could be built or not built by more than 18,000 yuan. After specific research, the Qijiang Iron Mine also revised its original plan, which required the state to invest in additional equipment to complete this year's production tasks. The entire mine cut investment by more than 430,000 yuan, and can still guarantee increased production. In the newly compiled plan, the mine focused on increasing production and practicing economy by streamlining production organizations, improving labor organization, and tapping the potential of equipment. For example, after merging the two production shafts into one, a large amount of additional materials and tools can be saved, more than 300 labor forces can be reduced, and at the same time, mining work can be more centrally managed.

The Zhongnan Rubber Factory, Southwest Pharmaceutical Factory, Beibei Glass Factory, and other units have all submitted their production plans to the workers for repeated discussions and revisions. The Beibei Glass Factory held a meeting of all employee representatives to discuss the production plan, and the employees put forward many suggestions for increasing output, improving quality, and expanding varieties, so that the total output value and profits turned over to the state this year can be increased by 48% to 53% compared with last year. The workers of the Southwest Pharmaceutical Factory recently proposed 39 measures related to increasing production and practicing economy and ensuring safety and quality. Implementing eight of the main measures can save more than 210,000 yuan.

    重庆不少工矿交通企业
    根据增产节约精神订出先进的生产计划
    新华社重庆20日电　重庆市不少工矿、交通企业根据增产节约精神，订出了今年的生产计划。
    煤炭工业部重庆管理局针对重庆和四川地区用煤量迅速增加的情况，在安排今年计划的时候，确定首先集中相当的资金、人力，加速即将投入生产的新井建设工程和旧井的改建扩建，同时很好挖掘现有矿井的生产潜力。这样，这个局今年的生产计划，将比原来五年计划规定的1957年计划产量增长25％，比去年产量增加二十八万吨。重庆铁路管理局在总结去年的生产运输工作中，认为成绩虽然很大，但是安全事故严重，全年发生的行车事故，就有六百一十次。同时，线路、机车等的养护维修工作不好，运输质量显著下降。这些都影响了运输潜力的发挥。针对这些缺点，这个局在制定今年的计划中，以提高运输质量和保证安全为中心，提出了有效的措施。这样全局仅今年第一季度的计划，即比铁道部下达的任务增加四十二万吨货运，十五万人次客运。
    有些计划订得不切实际的单位，还根据增产节约的精神重新修订了计划。重庆发电厂第一次制定的今年计划比较草率；最近重新组织力量，深入调查研究人力、设备等方面的潜力以后，重新修订了计划。这个厂在第一次订计划的时候，认为劳动力不够，决定增加管理干部五十多人，经过切实的调查，发现各车间、科室在使用劳动力上都有浪费，决定缩减编制，有效使用人力，全厂不但不必增加人，反减少了劳动力，此外，这个厂还根据调查研究的情况，降低了十四万六千多度厂用电和几百吨原煤的消耗，削减了可建可不建的工程投资一万八千多元。綦江铁矿在具体研究之后，也将原来要求国家投资增加设备来完成今年生产任务的计划作了修改。全矿共削减了投资四十三万多元，同样能保证增加生产。这个矿在重新编制的计划中，着重从精简生产机构，改善劳动组织，发挥设备潜力等方面来增产节约。如将两个生产坑口合并为一个以后，就能节约大量添置的物资、工具，减少了三百多个劳动力，同时，使采矿工作更能集中管理。
    中南橡胶厂、西南制药厂、北碚玻璃厂等单位，都将生产计划交给职工进行了反复讨论和修正补充。北碚玻璃厂召开全厂职工代表会议讨论了生产计划，职工们提出了许多增加产量、提高品质、扩大品种的意见、使全厂今年的生产总值和上缴利润，可比去年提高48％到53％以上。西南制药厂职工最近提出了有关增产节约和保证安全、质量的措施三十九项，实行其中八项主要措施，就可以节约二十一万多元。
