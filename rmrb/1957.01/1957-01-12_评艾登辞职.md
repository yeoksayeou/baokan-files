	On Eden's Resignation
	By Alan Winnington, correspondent for the British "Daily Worker"

    Facing the enormous public pressure for a new government and a fundamental change in policy, the British Conservative Party is doing everything it can to hold on to its ruling position. The anti-Conservative movement triggered by the Suez War has become unstoppable, and as a result, the Conservative Party has had to retreat.
    Like bandits fleeing in disarray, they have thrown the exposed leader, Eden, to the howling pursuers, hoping that this will ease the mass movement and allow the other culprits who caused the Suez War to escape unscathed.
    After forcing Eden to step down under the pretext of poor health (everyone knows this is just an excuse), the representatives of monopoly capital in the Conservative Party hope to postpone new elections, try to consolidate their position, and then find a way to rebuild their shattered credibility.
    Eden's "resignation" is an open acknowledgement of the power of the mass movement; however, the main culprits are still at large. The new Prime Minister, Macmillan himself, was one of the most staunch supporters of the policy of aggression against Egypt. Therefore, the main problem facing Britain today is how to overthrow the Conservative government, force them to step down, and hold new elections, in which the Labour Party will win a landslide victory.
    Eden was forced to step down before the full consequences of his policies had been seen by the British public. However, with the announcement of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," Conservative leaders knew that the US plan to replace Britain's remaining power in the Middle East would cause new waves of anger throughout the Suez policy. The public (including the Conservative Party's own supporters) will be even more enraged, and the Conservative Party's votes will be further reduced.
    Immediate action is needed. Therefore, Eden hurriedly ran to see the Queen, bringing out the old deceptive trick that the so-called servants of the people are appointed and dismissed by the royal family. However, the decision to resign must have been even more difficult for the Conservative leaders than for Eden. Eden accepted this decision for the benefit of his class.
    Because, by discarding Eden, the Conservative Party lost its greatest hope of continuing to deceive the public. They lost a "honest" person with big eyes and a frank appearance who had gained a reputation for opposing the Munich Agreement against his will. His painstakingly acquired reputation also included having contributed to the establishment of the United Nations; they lost a handsome, well-mannered, and well-dressed "peace envoy"; a person who could reliably win many non-political votes simply by his appearance, a person who could attract the votes of immature girls without a definite goal. Eden was not a bad political poker card. The Conservative leaders' political cupboard is only left with naked agents of monopoly capitalism, such as Butler and Macmillan. Butler is a notorious capitalist, and Macmillan is such an obvious member of the ruling class that no worker would be fooled by him.
    And Eden? For twenty years, he had been cultivated to become an ideal Conservative Prime Minister, a shadow of Churchill. But he is the Prime Minister with the shortest tenure in decades. This is naturally a very painful decision, but the Conservative Party had to make this decision in order to save others.
    The fact that the Conservative Party had to take this decision shows how deep a crisis recent developments have pushed Britain into. The Eden-Macmillan cabinet's decision to invade Egypt has brought disaster to the public (including the broad strata who usually vote Conservative).
    The war of aggression against Egypt has caused increasingly serious consequences in all aspects. Due to the lack of oil, the number of unemployed workers and those working short hours is increasing day by day. The worst hit are the large automobile companies in Dagenham and Coventry. There, except for 20,000 auto workers who still have three days of work a week, the rest have been laid off. The big bosses in the auto industry expect that within a few weeks, all 800,000 workers in the industry will be affected. Transportation companies are on the verge of bankruptcy. Due to the implementation of oil rationing, the transportation industry has fallen into chaos. The impact has also spread to other enterprises. For example, shopkeepers, although most of them voted Conservative, are now the first to suffer because of reduced worker incomes and reduced purchasing power.
    At the same time, capitalists are using the crisis as an excuse to reject the demands of millions of workers for wage increases due to the soaring cost of living. The government has raised the prices of bread, milk and other daily necessities, and passenger transportation prices have also increased.
    The British government has shown extreme political madness by forcing Parliament to pass the Rent Act. This act will make millions of households (including the middle class) pay more rent for old houses; landlords will have the right to kick tenants who cannot pay the increased rent out into the street.
    It is not surprising that the British Conservative government is getting less and less support. It has shaken its foundation by carrying out a brutal imperialist aggression against Egypt.
    The recent parliamentary by-election in Mid-Oxon was a serious warning to the Conservative Party: popular support for it has plummeted. However, it was not until after the by-election that the Conservative Party saw its fate and tried to save face by letting Eden step down.
    This by-election was held because Nutting resigned from the cabinet because he disagreed with the Eden cabinet's decision to invade Egypt. Mid-Oxon was called a "safe" Conservative seat. No one would have dreamed that a Labour candidate would be elected there. This place is the location of the extremely "upper class" and extremely conservative Bullingdon Club. Here, the remnant forces are very strong, and the villagers still have to tip their hats to the masters and pastors, and even doctors are despised because they engage in labor.
    It is common for by-elections to have fewer votes than general elections. But in this by-election, the Conservative Party's votes dropped by nearly 10,000, while the Labour Party basically maintained its original number of votes, and the Conservative Party almost lost its "safe" seat.
    If this unexpected thing can happen in such a place, then, according to those familiar with the matter, this means that national support for the Conservative Party has decreased to an unexpected and dramatic degree. If a general election is held in the next few weeks or months, the Labour Party can win more than 400 or even 500 seats, making the Conservative Party a minority in the House of Commons.
    The unpopularity of the Conservative Party among small business owners can be seen from the example of a female taxi owner. Due to the lack of gasoline, her business is facing the threat of bankruptcy. She picked up a brick and smashed the window of the Portsmouth Conservative Party branch.
    After being hit in the Mid-Oxon election, the divisions within the Conservative Party expanded. There was a group within the party that opposed the invasion of Egypt and another group that clamored against withdrawing troops from Egypt. If there is an election now, many Conservative MPs will face the risk of losing their minimum number of seats. They began to put pressure on the cabinet not to force the passage of the hated Rent Act and make things worse.
    The new rebellion in the Conservative Party has reached such a degree that "The Times" felt it necessary to warn them with the following words:
      "In some respects, there are ominous signs leading thinking in the wrong direction, especially in domestic affairs. The fact that Conservative backbenchers are now frightened by the consequences of the Rent Act is a sign. Mid-Oxon certainly confirmed their blindness."
    This ironic call to unite the Conservative Party so that landlords can plunder tenants, or this "blindness" to the ordinary members of the Conservative Party, which is very clear, and even "The Times" could not see its fate until two weeks ago, cannot be compared to anything.
    Parliament is on recess, but the crisis continues to develop. Workers are coming forward with negotiation conditions to demand wage increases; strikes have broken out in the auto industry to defend the right to work; tenant associations are taking action against the Rent Act; and the "Daily Worker" is fighting to call on the people to force the Conservative government to step down. The "Daily Worker" calls on voters to conduct mass petitions to members of Parliament on January 22, the day Parliament reconvenes, to form the climax of this struggle.
    Throughout this period, sentiment against the American "ally" has been rising. The view that the United States skillfully used Eden's criminal stupidity to benefit itself has been confirmed by the fact that the Texas oil tycoon has tightened production and raised oil prices for Britain. Then came the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Even the most arrogant pro-American figures in the Conservative group expressed their indifference to it under the conditions allowed by dollar diplomacy. The full effect of this American "friendship" action has been revealed. It has made the Conservative Party even more divided. The anti-"Eisenhower Doctrine" group expressed dissatisfaction. According to Reuters, "Eden was forced to resign due to internal pressure from the Conservative Party. Influential leaders within the Conservative Party believe that Sir Anthony Eden continuing as Prime Minister is a serious obstacle to rebuilding full trust between Washington and London." More bluntly, the "Daily Mail" asked whether Washington had now appointed Britain's Prime Minister.
    Obviously, in the past few weeks, the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress have gained broad mass support, expanded the divisions within the Conservative group, and challenged the government.
    However, at this time, Labour leader Gaitskell (who is visiting the United States) sold the support of millions of organized workers in Britain to the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Gaitskell's line and the line of the right wing of the British labor movement have always been the line of "Britain and the United States against communism."
    Instead of calling on the British people to kick away the bankrupt Conservative Party, which led to the "Eisenhower Doctrine" due to its crimes, the upper-level leaders of the working class support the "Eisenhower Doctrine" even more than the Conservative Party. He said, "Britain will have difficulties in leading Middle East policy in the future, and we very much hope that the United States can do this."
    Gaitskell's support for the "Eisenhower Doctrine" saved the Conservative Party at a critical moment. At this time, the united action of the British working class can win the vast majority of the British people, completely drive the Conservative Party out of power, and elect a new government to adopt a friendly policy towards the former "spheres of influence" and colonies, and ensure that Britain embarks on the road to economic recovery and socialism.
    This raises a question. If this is the case, then why does Gaitskell call for a general election? Is he willing to lead the people to establish a new government, while he serves as Prime Minister while maintaining the status quo?
    The history of Gaitskell and other right-wing leaders of the labor movement can indeed prove this. They like to play parliamentary tricks within the strict limits of the parliamentary system. This parliamentary system allows two parties that differ only in details or methods to politely take turns in power to appease public opinion.
    In this case, the Conservative Party can continue to rule for three years until the expiration of the current parliament, because they still hold a majority in parliament. This can give them enough time to attack the workers' living standards, make people forget the Suez Canal, and cultivate a new figure to replace the fallen Eden.
    Another method is to launch a movement to overthrow the Conservative Party and force a general election, as called for by the Communist Party. This means leading workers to strike, carry out propaganda and agitation, march, oppose rent increases and repossession of rented houses—to use the full power of the entire British labor movement and mobilize all forces that can be mobilized.
    There is no doubt that Eden's fall does not mean a change in the Conservative Party's policy, but it is just a trick to confuse the public, try to undermine and split the irresistible mass movement, and deal with different strata of this movement separately.
    However, it is doubtful whether the British public will be fooled by this plan, no matter what Gaitskell demands. The Conservative Party's policies will continue, and the people must continue to fight against them. Gaitskell is afraid of the revolutionary nature of the mass movement that can bring down the Conservative Party, but he has no other choice but to take the lead himself.
    Last year we saw how Gaitskell tried to drag the labor movement to support the Conservative Party on the Suez issue, but he failed; as a result, the mass movement developed so strongly and rapidly that he had to lead it, otherwise he would be washed away by history. How can the British public follow this disproportionate "leader" and want to participate in world opinion to end Eden's war policy?
    The struggle against the Conservative government may be temporarily confused by Eden's resignation. However, unless there is a near-impossible change in the Conservative Party's policies, the struggle against the results of the disastrous aggression in Suez will inevitably continue and will directly oppose the real criminals—the Conservative government, now led by Macmillan.
    January 22 should be a day of great struggle in London. People from all over Britain, responding to the call of the "Daily Worker" and the Communist Party, are preparing to petition members of Parliament when Parliament reopens under its unpopular new leader. They will demand the end of this government, and they will return to their regions to continue fighting for this. This occasion is the starting point of a new climax in the struggle, and Labour leaders will have to lead this struggle in the second stage.
    There is no doubt that the British people are determined to abandon the entire Conservative government, and they can do it in a few weeks under the leadership of the entire labor movement. At the same time, the Communist Party and the "Daily Worker" are doing everything possible to unite the working masses in a situation where a new era will unfold in British political history.

    评艾登辞职
    英国“工人日报”记者　阿兰·魏宁顿
    面对着公众要求成立新政府和根本改变政策的巨大压力，英国保守党正竭尽全力来保住执政的地位。苏伊士战争所引起的倒保守党运动已经势不可挡，结果保守党不得不后退了。
    像狼狈逃窜的盗匪一样，他们把原形毕露的首领艾登丢给呼啸追击的人，希望这样可以缓和群众运动而使招致苏伊士战争失败的其他罪魁得以幸免。
    以健康状况不佳为理由（人人都知道这不过是个借口）把艾登赶下台后，保守党中的垄断资本代表们希望能够推延新的大选，设法巩固自己的地位，然后再来寻找一条途径重建已经扫地的信誉。
    艾登的“辞职”，是对于群众运动力量的公开承认；但是，主要的祸首仍然逍遥法外。新首相麦克米伦本人就是侵略埃及政策的最坚决的支持者之一。因此，英国目前面对着的主要问题，是如何推翻保守党政府，迫使他们下台，进行新的选举，在这次选举中工党会大获全胜。
    在艾登政策的全部后果还没有为英国广大公众所看到之前，他就被迫去职了。但是，由于“艾森豪威尔主义”的公布，保守党领袖们知道，美国这个取代英国在中东的残余势力的计划，将会在整个苏伊士政策所引起的不断高涨的怒潮中掀起新的浪头。公众（包括保守党自己的拥护者在内）将更加激怒，保守党所得的选票则将进一步减少。
    需要立即采取行动。因此，艾登匆匆忙忙地跑去见女王，重新搬出了所谓人民的公仆都是由皇室任命和解职的这套古老的骗人把戏来。但是，辞职的决定，对于保守党领袖们说来，比对于艾登一定更加难以接受。艾登是为了本阶级的利益而接受这一决定的。
    因为，保守党丢掉了艾登，就等于丢掉了继续欺骗公众的最大希望。他们丢掉了一个曾经并非出自心愿而取得了反对过慕尼黑协定的声誉的眼睛大大、相貌坦率的“忠厚”人，他煞费苦心得来的声望还包括曾为联合国的建立出过力；他们丢掉了一个漂亮、彬彬有礼、衣着考究的“和平使者”；一个单纯凭他的仪表就能稳当地得到许多非政治性的选票的人，一个能够吸引刚刚成年的没有一定目标的女孩子的选票的人。艾登是一张不坏的政治扑克牌。保守党的领袖们的政治橱柜里只剩下了垄断资本主义的赤裸裸的代理人，诸如巴特勒和麦克米伦之流。巴特勒是臭名远扬的资本家，麦克米伦是如此明显的统治阶级中的一员，以致没有一个工人会上他的当。
    而艾登呢？二十年来对他的培养，就是为了把他造就成一个理想的保守党的首相、丘吉尔的影子。但他是比几十年来任何一位首相任期都短的首相。这自然是一个很痛苦的决定，然而，保守党为了挽救其他而不得不作出了这个决定。
    保守党不得不采取这个决定，表明最近事态的发展已把英国推向何等深刻的危机了。艾登—麦克米伦内阁侵略埃及的决定已经给公众（包括通常投保守党票的广泛阶层在内）带来了灾难。
    侵埃战争给各方面造成了日益严重的恶果。由于石油的缺乏，失业工人和做短工的人数一天比一天增加。受到最大打击的要算达金汉姆和考文垂两个地方的大汽车公司。那里，除了两万汽车工人一个星期还有三天活可干以外，其余的都被解雇了。汽车业的大企业主们预料，不出几个星期，全业八十万工人都将受到影响。运输公司正处于不得不倒闭的状态中。由于实行石油配给，运输业已陷于混乱。影响也波及到别的企业。例如，店主们虽然大多数投了保守党的票，但是现在也由于工人收入削减，购买力降低，而首先身受其害。
    与此同时，资本家们却拿危机作为借口，拒绝成百万工人们因生活指数扶摇直上而提出的增加工资要求。政府抬高了面包、牛奶和其他日用必需品的价格，客运的价格也提高了。
    英国政府表现出政治上的极端疯狂性，竟迫使议会通过了房租法案。这个法案将使得数百万住户（包括中产阶级）住旧房子而却要付出更多的租金；房主们将有权把付不出增加租金的房客赶到街头。
    英国保守党政府所得到的支持越来越少，这是不足为怪的。它因对埃及进行了残暴的帝国主义侵略而动摇了自己的基础。
    最近在密尔敦莫勃莱举行的议员补缺选举，是对保守党的严重警告：人民对它的支持已一落千丈。但是，直到预选以后，保守党才看到了自己的命运，才用让艾登下台的办法来挽回面子。
    这次补缺选举是因纳丁不同意艾登内阁所作侵埃决定而退出内阁而举行的。密尔敦莫勃莱被称作保守党“稳当”的一席。人们做梦也不会想到工党的人会在那里当选。这块地方是十足“上层”和极其保守的库尔恩贵族狩猎俱乐部所在地。在这里，残余的势力很大，老乡们还要向老爷和牧师们脱帽敬礼，甚至医生也因为他们从事劳动而被人轻视。
    在补缺选举中得票比大选少，这是常事。但在这次预选中，保守党所得票数竟下降近一万票之多，而工党却基本上保持了原来的票数，保守党差一点失去了它的“稳当”的一席。
    如果这件意外事情可以在这样一个地方发生，那末，据熟悉此道的人们说，这就意味着全国对保守党的支持已减少到一种出乎意外的戏剧性的程度。如果大选在下几个星期或数月内举行的话，工党可以赢得四百多甚至五百个席位，使保守党在下院成为少数党。
    对保守党在小业主中之不得人心，可以从一个出租汽车女业主的例子看出。由于缺乏汽油，使她的营业面临破产的威胁，她拿起一块砖头击破了朴次茅斯保守党分部的窗子。
    在密尔敦莫勃莱的选举受到打击之后，保守党内的分裂扩大了。在党内有了一个反对侵略埃及的集团和另一个大吵大闹反对从埃及撤兵的集团。如果现在有一次选举的话，许多保守党的议员就会面临着失去最低限度的多数议席的危险。他们开始向内阁施加压力，要它不强迫通过令人憎恨的房租法案而把事情搞得更糟。
    保守党中的新的反叛行为达到了这样的程度，致使“泰晤士报”认为有必要用下列的话来警告他们：
      “在某些方面已有不祥的迹象将思路导致错误的方向，特别是在内政方面。保守党的后座议员现在被房租法案的后果吓坏了，这是一种预兆。密尔敦莫勃莱更肯定了他们的盲目性。”
    这种使保守党团结起来以便房主能够掠夺房客的讽刺性的号召，或者这种对保守党的普通议员是非常明白而“泰晤士报”甚至在两星期前还看不到自己的命运的“盲目性”，都是难以用任何事情来加以比拟的。
    议会在休假，但是危机还是继续发展。工人拿着谈判的条件前来要求提高工资；为了保卫工作的权利，罢工在汽车工业中爆发了；租佃人协会采取反对房租法案的行动；“工人日报”为号召人民迫使保守党政府下台而进行斗争。“工人日报”号召选民们在1月22日议会重新开会的那天向议员进行群众性的请愿，以形成这个斗争的高潮。
    在这整个时期中，反对美国“盟邦”的情绪在高涨。认为美国巧妙地利用艾登犯罪性的愚蠢使自己获利的看法，已被得克萨斯石油大王紧缩生产提高对英国的石油价格这件事所证实了。接着而来的是“艾森豪威尔主义”。甚至保守党集团中最狂妄的亲美派人士，也在美元外交所允许的情况下表示了对它的冷淡。这种美国的“友谊”行动所产生的全部效果，显露出来了。它已使保守党更加陷于分裂。反“艾森豪威尔主义”的集团表示不满。据路透社报道，“艾登是因保守党内部的压力而被迫辞职的。保守党内有影响的领袖认为艾登爵士继续担任首相是重建华盛顿与伦敦之间充分信任关系的严重障碍。”更为露骨的是，“每日简报”提出华盛顿现在是否指定了英国的首相。
    很明显，在过去几周内，工党和职工大会得到了广大群众的支持，扩大了保守党集团的分裂，并向政府挑战。
    但是，正在这个时候，工党领袖盖次克尔（正在访问美国）却把英国数百万有组织的工人的支持出卖给“艾森豪威尔主义”。盖次克尔的路线和英国工人运动右翼的路线，总是“英国与美国反对共产主义”的路线。
    工人阶级上层领袖不去号召英国人民踢开破产了的、因其罪恶而导致“艾森豪威尔主义”的保守党，反而比保守党更加支持“艾森豪威尔主义”。他说，“英国将来在领导中东政策上是有困难的，我们很希望美国能这样做。”
    盖次克尔这样地支持“艾森豪威尔主义”，就是在紧要关头挽救了保守党。在这个时候，英国工人阶级的联合行动，能够争取到绝大多数的英国人民群众，把保守党完全赶下台去，选举出一个新的政府，使它采取一种对从前的“势力范围”地区和殖民地保持友好的政策，并保证英国走上恢复经济和社会主义的道路。
    这样就会产生一个问题。如果确是如此，那么为什么盖次克尔要号召举行一次大选呢？是否他愿意领导人民建立一个新政府，而由他在维持现状的情况下担任首相呢？
    盖次克尔和其他劳工运动右翼领袖们的历史，确实可以证明这一点。他们喜欢在议会制度的严格限度内玩弄议会的把戏。这种议会制度使得仅仅在细节上或方法上不同的两个政党有礼貌地更替上台，以平息舆论。
    在这种情况下，保守党可以继续执政三年直到本届议会期满为止，因为他们在议会里仍然占多数。这样，可以给他们足够的时间来打击工人的生活水平，使人们忘记苏伊士运河以及扶植一个新的人物来代替垮了台的艾登。
    另外一个办法是共产党所号召的进行一个倒保守党的运动，并且迫使举行大选。这就意味着要领导工人举行罢工、进行宣传鼓动、游行、反对增加房租和收回租房等——要运用整个英国工人运动的全部力量并动员一切可以动员的力量。
    毫无疑问，艾登的下台决不意味着保守党政策的改变，而这仅仅是一种诡计，用以迷惑公众，企图破坏和分裂不可抗拒的群众运动，并分别对付这个运动的不同阶层。
    但是，无论盖次克尔要求什么，英国公众会被这种计划所愚弄，是值得怀疑的。保守党的政策将会继续下去，人民必须继续与之作斗争。盖次克尔害怕可以搞垮保守党的群众运动的革命性，但是他没有其他的选择，只好自己来带头。
    去年我们看见盖次克尔如何设法在苏伊士问题上把工人运动拖去支持保守党，但他失败了；结果群众运动发展得这样强大而迅速，以致他不得不领导它，否则就要被历史冲刷掉。英国公众怎么能跟随这位不相称的“领袖”，而想参加世界舆论来结束艾登的战争政策呢？
    反对保守党政府的斗争可能暂时会被艾登的辞职引起混乱。但是，除非保守党的政策发生近乎不可能的改变，否则，反对侵略苏伊士惨败的结果的斗争就必将继续进行下去，并将直接反对真正的罪犯——现在以麦克米伦为首的保守党政府。
    1月22日应该是伦敦进行伟大斗争的一天。人们响应“工人日报”和共产党的号召从英国各地来到这里，准备在议会在它的不受欢迎的新领袖领导之下重开的时候，向议员们请愿。他们将要求结束这个政府，他们将回到他们的地区继续为此而斗争。这个场合是斗争新高潮的起点，工党领袖们在第二个阶段不得不领导这个斗争。
    毫无疑问，英国人民决心要抛弃整个保守党政府，他们在整个工人运动的领导下能在几个星期内办得到。同时，共产党和“工人日报”正在尽一切力量在英国政治历史将展开新的时代的情况下把工人群众团结起来。　（立方译）
