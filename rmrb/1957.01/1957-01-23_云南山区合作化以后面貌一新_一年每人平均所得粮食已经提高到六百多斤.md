Yunnan's mountainous areas, which have already been cooperativized, have seen an increase in average annual grain income per person from 393 jin in 1952 to 633 jin.

The mountainous areas of Yunnan Province generally have an altitude of 2,000 to 4,000 meters; in the northern part, there are also some high-altitude and cold mountainous areas with altitudes of 2,500 to over 4,000 meters. In these mountainous areas, the growing conditions for crops are very poor, with little or no possibility of two harvests a year. However, they have superior conditions not found in ordinary mountainous areas: dense natural forests, vast natural pastures, and abundant mountain products and medicinal materials. Although these mountainous areas possess these superior conditions, the people still live a life of hardship, eating wild mountain vegetables and sleeping by the fire pit. In addition, the land is sparsely populated, making it difficult to resist the invasion of natural disasters, and the yield per mu is generally only a few dozen jin. The average annual income per person is only about 20 yuan, and in some cases only 12 or 13 yuan.

After cooperativization, the people in the high mountainous areas have basically ended that life of hardship. By the end of last year, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives in the mountainous areas of the province had developed to 24,413. Relying on the superiority of being organized, the cooperatives improved farming techniques and fixed cultivated land, resulting in a year-by-year increase in grain production. In 1956, many high-yield grain records appeared in the mountainous areas. For example, in Gaoping Township, Eshan Yi Autonomous County, the corn planted last year increased by more than eleven times compared to 1952, from just over 32 jin per mu to 380 jin; rice increased by more than three times compared to 1952, from 150 jin per mu to 479 jin. Since 1954, this township has also planted fruit trees, timber forests, etc., covering 4,836 mu, and cultivated 56,000 tree seedlings. In 1952, the average grain per person in the township was 237 jin, and the purchasing power was 5 yuan; by 1956, the average grain per person was 400 jin, and the purchasing power was 30 yuan and 5 jiao. The people of Longtan Township in Xundian County, after abandoning slash-and-burn agriculture and extensive but low-yield farming methods, created a model for transforming barren mountainous areas into fertile land. Their experience is to first fix the cultivated land. The experience of fixing cultivated land is to prioritize nearby land over distant land, retain fertile land and discard poor land, arrange the land according to soil quality, and process them separately: focus on processing first-class soil; comprehensively process second-class soil; rotate planting pasture on third-class soil; and use fourth-class soil for afforestation. After the comprehensive planning of mountainous land in this township, the area was not expanded, but reduced from 6,886 mu to 3,014 mu, but the output was greatly increased. The average grain per person in the township increased from 252 jin to 773 jin. The output in 1956 increased by 206% compared to 1952. After converting the fixed mountainous land into terraced fields, they built water conservancy projects and brought rice to the high mountains. In the past, the people of Longtan Township used to fill their stomachs with buckwheat, oats, potatoes mixed with wild vegetables, but now they can also eat white rice. After cooperativization, more than 80% of the grain-deficient households in Songlin Township, Rongfeng County, became surplus grain households, and the average yield per mu increased from 71 jin to 208 jin. Not long ago, this township carried out the long-term plan for the second five-year plan. After this plan is realized, the average grain per person in the township will increase from 737 jin to 2,288 jin.

    云南山区合作化以后面貌一新
    一年每人平均所得粮食已经提高到六百多斤
    本报讯　已经合作化了的云南省山区，每人一年平均所得粮食已由1952年的三百九十三斤提高到六百三十三斤。
    云南省的山区，一般海拔在二千至四千公尺；在北部，还有一部分海拔在二千五百至四千公尺以上的高寒山区。在这些山区，农作物生长条件很差，没有或很少有一年两熟的情况。可是在这里却有着一般山区所没有的优越条件：有茂密天然的林木、宽广的天然牧场、丰富的山货药材等等。虽然这些山区具备着这些优越的条件，但人们仍然过着吃山茅野菜、睡火塘觉的痛苦生活。再加上地广人稀，无力抵抗自然灾害的侵袭，每亩产量一般只有几十斤。每人每年平均收入仅二十元左右，有的只有十二、三元。
    合作化以后，高山区的人民基本上结束了那种痛苦的生活。到去年年底，全省山区农业生产合作社已发展到二万四千四百一十三个。合作社依靠组织起来的优越性，改进了耕作技术、固定了耕地，使粮食产量逐年增加。1956年内，山区就出现了许多粮食高产纪录。如峨山彝族自治县的高平乡，去年种植的包谷较1952年增产十一倍还多，由每亩产三十二斤多提高到三百八十斤；稻谷较1952年增产三倍多，由亩产一百五十斤提高到四百七十九斤。这个乡从1954年以来，还栽果树、造用材林等四千八百三十六亩，育树苗五万六千株。1952年全乡每人平均粮食二百三十七斤，购买力为五元；到1956年，则每人平均粮食为四百斤，购买力为三十元零五角。寻甸县龙谭乡的人民，在放弃了刀耕火种和广种薄收的耕作方法以后，创造了改造贫瘠山区的沃土的榜样。他们的经验是，首先固定耕地。固定耕地的经验是，先近后远、留肥去瘦，按照土质排队，分别进行加工：一等土重点加工；二等土全面加工；三等土轮种牧草；四等土用来造林。这个乡经过山地全面规划后，面积不是扩大，而是由六千八百八十六亩缩小为三千零一十四亩，但产量却大大地提高了。全乡每个人由平均粮食二百五十二斤，提高到七百七十三斤。1956年的产量比1952年提高206％。他们把固定下来的山地改为梯田后，兴修了水利，把稻谷搬上了高山。龙谭乡的人民，过去一向都是以荞子、燕麦、洋芋掺野菜来充饥，现在他们也吃到了白米饭。合作化后的榕峰县松林乡，有80％以上的缺粮户变成了余粮户，每亩平均产量由七十一斤，提高到二百零八斤。不久前，这个乡进行了第二个五年计划的远景规划。这个计划实现后，全乡人口每人就要由平均粮食七百三十七斤，提高到二千二百八十八斤了。
