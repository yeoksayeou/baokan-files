Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 22nd: According to a report from the Czechoslovak News Agency in Budapest: Hungarian Foreign Minister Horvath recently gave an interview to Czechoslovak journalists, answering some questions they raised regarding Hungary's foreign policy.

Horvath first pointed out that the recent resolutions passed by the United Nations under the manipulation of the United States on the so-called Hungarian issue, and the so-called five-member committee established according to this resolution, are aimed at encouraging the counter-revolutionary forces that have been suppressed and defeated but not completely eliminated, striving to maintain a tense situation, and attempting to obstruct the complete normalization of domestic life in Hungary. He pointed out that, as indicated in the Hungarian government's statement to the United Nations Secretary-General on January 10, no committee has the right to conduct inspections and collect information within Hungarian territory. The Hungarian government will continue to adhere to this view.

Horvath then spoke about the measures taken by the Hungarian government to ensure the return of refugees. He said that a committee has already set off for Austria to explain the situation to Hungarian citizens who have fled there. The Hungarian government is particularly concerned about the rapid repatriation of misguided juveniles. In this regard, it is hoped that the United Nations and relevant countries can provide assistance.

Horvath talked about the Soviet Union's proposal to request the United Nations to discuss the issue of U.S. interference in the internal affairs of People's Democratic countries. He said that the Hungarian government believes that it is absolutely necessary to discuss this issue in the United Nations. Such interference not only violates the sovereignty of People's Democratic countries but also constitutes a real danger to international peace. The Hungarian government will, based on conclusive evidence, demand that the United Nations General Assembly condemn the U.S. monopoly capitalists' acts of interference in Hungary's internal affairs.

    匈牙利外长霍瓦特发表谈话
    指责美国干涉匈牙利内政
    重申联合国委员会无权在匈境内视察
    据新华社布拉格22日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利外交部长霍瓦特最近向捷克斯洛伐克记者发表谈话，答复了他们提出的有关匈牙利外交政策的一些问题。
    霍瓦特首先指出，联合国最近在美国操纵下就所谓匈牙利问题通过的决议，和根据这个决议建立的所谓五人委员会，目的是鼓励已被镇压和击败但是还没有完全消灭的反革命势力，竭力保持紧张局势，力图阻挠匈牙利国内生活的完全正常化。他指出，正如匈牙利政府1月10日致联合国秘书长的声明中所指出的，任何委员会都无权在匈牙利境内进行视察和收集情报。匈牙利政府将继续坚持这个意见。
    霍瓦特接着谈到匈牙利政府对保证难民回国所采取的措施。他说，已经有一个委员会启程前往奥地利，以便向跑到那里的匈牙利公民进行解释工作。匈牙利政府特别关心的是，迅速遣返那些误入歧途的少年。在这方面，希望联合国和有关国家能够给予协助。
    霍瓦特谈到了苏联提出的要求联合国讨论美国干涉人民民主国家内政问题的建议，他说，匈牙利政府认为在联合国中讨论这个问题是绝对必要的。这样一种干涉不仅侵犯了人民民主国家的主权，同时也构成了对国际和平的真正危险。匈牙利政府将根据证据确凿的材料，要求联合国大会谴责美国垄断资本家干涉匈牙利内政的行为。
