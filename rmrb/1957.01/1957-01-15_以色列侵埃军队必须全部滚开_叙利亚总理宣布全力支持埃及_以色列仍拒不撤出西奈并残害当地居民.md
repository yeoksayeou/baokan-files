Xinhua News Agency, January 14th dispatch from Damascus: Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali announced that Syria "fully supports" Egypt's warning that Israel must withdraw rapidly from the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi wrote a letter to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on January 11, stating that if Israel continues to defy UN resolutions and world opinion and does not withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip, it "will only cause further deterioration of the situation and extremely serious consequences."

Al-Asali told reporters on January 12 that Syria firmly supports Egypt's actions. If the Israeli troops do not withdraw to the 1949 armistice line, the Arab countries will immediately implement the resolutions and recommendations of the Arab heads of state of last November. The communiqué issued at the Arab summit at that time declared that if the three countries of Britain, France, and Israel do not completely withdraw from Egyptian territory, the nine Arab countries will take effective measures in accordance with the obligations undertaken by the Arab Collective Security Treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, January 14th dispatch from Tel Aviv: Israeli Interior Minister Bar-Yehuda said on January 12 that Israel cannot withdraw any further from the Sinai Peninsula.

So far, the Israeli army has withdrawn from about two-thirds of the land in the Sinai Peninsula, and on the Mediterranean coast, it has only retreated to Al-Arish on the waterway.

Xinhua News Agency, January 14th dispatch from TASS Cairo, January 12th: According to the Middle East News Agency, the Israeli aggressor troops continue to brutalize Arab residents in the areas they occupy.

The news agency said that in Khan Yunis, Israeli soldiers robbed Arab residents, arrested young people between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five, and the invaders shot young people in front of their parents. At least four hundred and thirty Arabs have died from such brutal acts. In Gaza, the Israeli aggressor troops cruelly murdered nearly eight thousand young people.

Israeli soldiers also beat women and children with gun butts and chillingly tortured imprisoned Arabs. They arrested Arab residents en masse and robbed residents' property. According to "Al-Ahram," on January 10, the Israeli authorities transported four hundred Egyptian men, women, and children from Gaza and imprisoned them in concentration camps not far from Al-Arish.

According to the Middle East News Agency, the Secretariat of the League of Arab States learned that Israeli invaders also desecrated mosques, forbade Muslims from performing prayers, and even beat mosque custodians.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 14th: "Al-Ahram" said on January 13: "If a single Israeli soldier remains on Egyptian soil, thereby undermining the UN resolution, then Egypt will be free to take steps to restore respect for the UN resolution."

The Israeli aggressors in the Sinai Peninsula completely destroyed the transportation lines in the withdrawal area. The picture shows a corner of the Sinai Highway after it was destroyed. Now, the Egyptian people are stepping up repairs.

    以色列侵埃军队必须全部滚开
    叙利亚总理宣布全力支持埃及
    以色列仍拒不撤出西奈并残害当地居民
    新华社14日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚总理阿萨利宣布，叙利亚“全力支持”埃及关于要以色列从西奈半岛和加沙地带迅速撤退的警告。
    埃及外交部长法齐曾经在11日写信告诉联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德说，如果以色列继续蔑视联合国决议和世界舆论而不从西奈半岛和加沙地带撤退，那“只会引起局势进一步的恶化和极端严重的后果”。
    阿萨利在12日对新闻记者说，叙利亚坚决支持埃及的行动。如果以色列军队不撤到1949年停战线后面去，阿拉伯国家将立即执行阿拉伯国家首脑去年11月的决议和建议。阿拉伯国家首脑会议当时发表的公报曾经宣布，如果英、法、以三国不完全撤出埃及领土，九个阿拉伯国家将根据阿拉伯集体安全条约所承担的义务采取有效的措施。
    据新华社14日讯　特拉维夫消息：以色列内政部长巴尔—耶胡达12日说，以色列不能从西奈半岛再撤退。
    到现在为止，以色列军队在西奈半岛上约撤退了三分之二土地，在地中海沿岸的水路方面只退到阿里希。
    新华社14日讯　塔斯社开罗12日讯：据中东通讯社报道，以色列侵略军在他们所占领的地区继续残害阿拉伯居民。
    这家通讯社说，在汉龙尼斯，以色列士兵向阿拉伯居民进行抢劫，逮捕十八岁到二十五岁的青年，侵略者当着父母们的面枪杀青年人。至少有四百三十个阿拉伯人已经死于这种残暴行为下。在加沙，以色列侵略军残酷地杀害了将近八千个青年。
    以色列士兵还用枪柄殴打妇女和儿童，并且令人心寒地拷打被囚的阿拉伯人。他们大批地逮捕阿拉伯居民并且抢劫居民的财产。据“金字塔报”说，1月10日，以色列当局从加沙运走了四百个埃及男女成人和儿童，并把他们关入距阿里希不远的集中营。
    据中东通讯社报道，阿拉伯国家联盟书记处获悉：以色列侵略者还冒渎清真寺，不许伊斯兰教徒去做礼拜，甚至殴打清真寺看守人。
    据新华社开罗14日电　“金字塔报”1月13日说：“如果有一个以色列的士兵还停留在埃及的土地上，从而使联合国决议遭到破坏，那么，埃及将有自由采取步骤来恢复对联合国决议的尊重。”
