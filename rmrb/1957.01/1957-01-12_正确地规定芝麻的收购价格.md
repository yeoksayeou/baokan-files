    Correctly Stipulate the Purchase Price of Sesame
    By Our Staff Commentator
    The State Council recently issued instructions to stabilize sesame production, deciding to appropriately raise the purchase price of sesame nationwide, which is very timely.
    Sesame is one of China's main oil crops. Almost all parts of the country have the habit of eating sesame oil. The amount of sesame oil supplied by state-owned oil and fat companies accounts for about 10% of the total supply of various edible oils. At present, the supply of sesame oil (especially small mill sesame oil and sesame paste) is very insufficient. This is because the sesame production situation has not been good in recent years, and sesame production in some areas has shown a downward trend. It is estimated that the national sesame production in 1956 will be around 700 million jin, a decrease of nearly a quarter compared to 1955. If this situation is not quickly reversed, the insufficient supply of sesame oil will continue to develop, which should be taken seriously. There are many reasons for the decline in sesame production, and the low purchase price is an important one.
    Currently, the ratio of sesame purchase price to grain purchase price in major sesame producing areas is slightly higher than the seven-year average level from 1930 to 1936 before the Anti-Japanese War. From the comparison of the output value (excluding by-products) of each mu of land planted with sesame and grain and other agricultural products, taking the situation in 1955 as an example, the output value of each mu of sesame in major producing areas is generally higher than the output value of each mu of soybeans, corn, and red sorghum, except that it is lower than cotton and lower than the output value of corn and red sorghum in individual producing areas. This shows that the purchase price of sesame does not seem to be low. However, because the yield per unit area of grain has increased faster than that of sesame in recent years; although the output value per mu of sesame is not low compared to grain, the by-products obtained from planting sesame are much less than those from grain; planting sesame is very labor-intensive and requires more fertilizer, and sesame is extremely vulnerable to disasters and more unstable than grain production. Farmers actually do not earn as much from planting sesame as from planting grain or other crops. Especially after agricultural cooperativization, agricultural cooperatives implemented a work point system, the problem of high cost and low income from planting sesame became more prominent. Therefore, it is necessary to appropriately increase the purchase price of sesame.
    Based on the actual possibilities of agricultural production in our country at present, it is not possible to develop sesame production on a large scale. Because doing so will inevitably squeeze out a large amount of grain production. However, the downward trend of sesame production must be quickly reversed, and sesame production must be stabilized at a certain level. Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces are key producing areas for large-scale sesame planting. The sesame production in these areas should be maintained at a level that, in addition to meeting the basic needs of the region, also allows for the transfer of necessary quantities to adjust for the needs of other regions; the sesame production in other scattered producing areas should strive to be self-sufficient within the province. Therefore, when deciding on the amount of increase in the purchase price of sesame, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of both benefiting sesame production and not affecting grain production. To this end, all localities must collect necessary materials based on the actual conditions of the producing areas, and carefully study the price ratio between sesame and crops that compete for land (mainly grain), and what level should be maintained to be correct and reasonable, so as to ensure that sesame and other crops can develop proportionally. This is a very arduous and important task.
    Maintaining sesame production and appropriately increasing sesame production cannot be solved solely by increasing the purchase price of sesame. More importantly, effective measures must be taken on production. In 1956, the sesame production in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces accounted for about 62% of the total national sesame production. In these key producing areas for large-scale sesame planting (especially state-owned farms and agricultural research institutions in sesame producing areas), they should actively experiment with and promote improved varieties of sesame and strive to increase the yield per unit area of sesame. Other scattered producing areas used to have the habit of planting sesame on the edges of fields and plots, and this should be appropriately restored in the future. This is also very beneficial to improving the supply of sesame oil in these areas.

    正确地规定芝麻的收购价格
    本报评论员
    国务院最近为了稳定芝麻的生产，已经发出指示，决定把全国芝麻的收购价格适当提高，这是很适合时宜的。
    芝麻是我国主要油料作物之一。全国各地几乎都有吃芝麻油的习惯。国营油脂公司供应芝麻油的数量，约占各种食油总供应量的10％左右。目前芝麻油的供应（尤其是小磨香油和芝麻酱）是很不充足的。这是因为，近几年来芝麻的生产情况不够好，有些地区的芝麻产量有下降的趋势。预计1956年全国的芝麻产量约在七亿斤上下，比1955年减产近四分之一左右。这种情况如果不迅速扭转，芝麻油的供应不足还会继续发展，应该引起重视。芝麻减产的原因很多，其中收购价格偏低是一个重要原因。
    目前芝麻收购价格同粮食收购价格的比价，在主要芝麻产区已经稍高于抗日战争以前1930年到1936年的七年平均水平。从每亩土地种植芝麻和粮食等农产品的产值（不包括副产品）的比较上看，以1955年的情况为例，主要产区的每亩芝麻的产值，除掉比棉花低些和个别产区比玉米、红粮的产值低一些以外，一般都高于每亩黄豆、玉米、红粮的产值。说明芝麻的收购价格似也并不低。但是，由于几年来粮食的单位面积产量比芝麻增长得快；芝麻的每亩产值比粮食虽然不低，而种植芝麻所得的副产品比粮食少得多；种植芝麻很费工，需要的肥料也多，再加上芝麻的抗灾能力极弱，比粮食生产更不稳定等种种原因，农民种植芝麻实际上不如种植粮食或其它农作物的收益多。尤其在农业合作化以后，农业合作社实行评工记分制度，种植芝麻的成本高、收益少的问题，就更加突出了。因此，适当提高芝麻的收购价格就是必要的了。
    从我国目前农业生产的实际可能出发，还不能大量地发展芝麻的生产。因为这样做势必要大量地挤掉粮食的生产。但是，必须迅速扭转芝麻产量下降的趋势，把芝麻的生产稳定在一定的水平上。河南、湖北、安徽三省是成片种植芝麻的重点产区，这些地区的芝麻产量应该保持在除了满足本地区的基本需要之外，还要调出必要的数量调剂其它地区的需要；其它分散产区的芝麻产量，应该力争做到在本省范围能够自给。因之，决定芝麻收购价格提高的幅度的时候，必须遵守：既有利于芝麻的生产，又不致影响粮食生产的原则。为此，各地必须根据产区的实际情况，搜集必要的材料，认真地研究芝麻同相互争地的农作物（主要是粮食）之间的比价，保持怎样的水平才能正确、合理，以便保证芝麻同其它农作物能够按比例地发展。这是一个很为艰巨而又重要的任务。
    维持芝麻的生产，适当提高芝麻的产量，不能仅仅依靠提高芝麻的收购价格来解决。更重要的还是必须从生产上采取有效措施。1956年河南、湖北、安徽三个省的芝麻产量，约占全国芝麻总产量的62％，在这些成片种植芝麻的重点产区（特别是芝麻产区的国营农场和农业研究机关），应该积极试验和推广芝麻的优良品种，努力提高芝麻的单位面积产量。其它分散产区，过去多有在田边、地头种植芝麻的习惯，今后还应该适当地恢复。这对改善这些地区芝麻油的供应也是很有好处的。
