    Great Country, Eternal Friendship
    Hungarian journalist Fabijan Ferenc
    Only now, as I am about to write, do I feel that fulfilling my promise to summarize my experiences in China in an article is not an easy task. Only now, as I open my notebook and recall what I have seen and heard in China these past two months, do I suddenly realize that these two months have been filled with such rich impressions and experiences. To write about these things would require not an article, but a book.
    I have been to the cool north and to the lush, hot south; I have sailed among the strange rocks of Dalian Bay and on the majestic, broad Pearl River. I have admired the magnificence of Mount Tai and praised the enchanting scenery of Hangzhou.
    I have also had some contact with the great history of China and the Chinese people. The amazing historical relics and scenic spots of Beijing tell us about thousands of years of Chinese culture, while the things in Nanjing and Guangzhou tell us about the history of modern Chinese revolution. I walked on the streets of Nanjing planted with French parasol trees, and almost every stone there shone with the great revolutionary relics of the past and the historical light of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising. I also paid my respects with a heavy heart to the martyrs' cemetery on Yuhuatai, where tens of thousands of martyrs were killed by Chiang Kai-shek's criminal rule, and to the lush grass and trees irrigated by the martyrs' blood. I also paid homage with reverence to the tomb of Sun Yat-sen, the great son of the Chinese people who was born ninety years ago. Thirty years ago, he predicted: "I wish to express my fervent hope that dawn will soon break, at which time the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally, and the two countries will join hands in the great battle for the freedom of the oppressed nations of the world to achieve victory."
    In Guangzhou, my heart was filled with unusual feelings because the first Chinese workers' regime appeared here. I visited with excitement the Peasant Movement Training Institute where comrades Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Guo Moruo, and Lin Boqu gave lectures. This Peasant Movement Training Institute cultivated many outstanding leaders in the Chinese peasant movement.
    Shanghai also gave me unforgettable impressions. I visited the residence where Lu Xun, the Chinese Gorky, whom Comrade Mao Zedong called "the greatest and bravest standard-bearer of the new cultural army," spent the last few years of his life. In the Lu Xun Memorial Hall, we were happy and proud to see the photos of Petőfi among the works of foreign writers translated by Lu Xun.
    I was attracted by the heavy industry of the Northeast, the highly automated blast furnaces and steel pipe plants of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the immeasurable rich coal mines and oil fields of Fushun, and the modern tool factories of Shenyang. I also saw great construction: rapidly established factories, new, modern housing, and dams built with enormous labor. The liberated Chinese people have used their own strength to prevent floods that have plagued them for hundreds of years. In Wuhan, I touched the iron beams spanning the Yangtze River, and in a year, a majestic bridge will be erected over this longest of all rivers.
    I have talked to many Chinese people, including workers and capitalists, Shandong people and Guangdong people, young people, soldiers, writers, artists, journalists, Communists, and people with different worldviews. I saw the daily life of the great Chinese people, and I also spent the National Day of October 1st happily with my Chinese friends.
    During the visit, every conversation and the smiles of the beautiful black-eyed Chinese children are unforgettable memories for me. But who can write all these things into an article without omission?
    In Hungary, interest in China and the Chinese people is extremely widespread. Especially in the last three or forty years, Hungarians have paid great attention to the heroic struggles of the Chinese people to win national independence and for a socialist future. Anyone who has read books about the heroic struggles of the Chinese people under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party will inevitably talk endlessly to others about the "Chinese miracle." The heroism shown by the Chinese people in several domestic revolutionary wars and in the unprecedented Long March, and the heroic struggle shown by the Chinese people in socialist construction, have indeed shaken people's hearts like a miracle.
    The greatest gain from my experience in China is getting to know the Chinese people and finding the answer to this miracle. The perseverance, discipline, profound understanding between each other, infinite love for labor, unparalleled humility, and ardent patriotism of the Chinese people are indeed the source of the "Chinese miracle."
    The high degree of labor discipline I saw in the factory left a deep impression on me. In the People's Republic of China, wherever I went: city or countryside, street or park, museum or entertainment venue, I would be surrounded by people who asked me many questions with great interest. But the situation was different in the factory. No matter where I went, or if I had a brief conversation with a worker, no worker around would stop working for even a moment because of this. This seems like a small thing, and perhaps the Chinese, who are already accustomed to a high degree of labor discipline, would find it strange that I even mention this small thing. But I still believe that the achievements made since liberation are inseparable from this conscious labor discipline.
    Shortly after arriving in China, I went to visit the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant. Comrade Lin Jinyu from the plant told me that their first five-year plan had been completed on October 1st of last year, which was one year and three months ahead of schedule. Frankly speaking, at the time I thought their plan might have been set too low, but later I learned that it was not strange to achieve such results with the Chinese people's labor enthusiasm and discipline. Therefore, when I heard in Wuhan that the Yangtze River Bridge would be completed at the end of this year—one year ahead of schedule—I almost took it for granted.
    I remember in a conversation at the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Agricultural Machine Tractor Station in Ziyang County, Shandong Province, the head of the farm, Director Yang, enthusiastically told us how selflessly the Hungarian experts working on the farm were working and how they had trained many trained groups in just a few months.
    Comrade Albat Velez, a Hungarian expert, said to me sincerely and decisively: "With such people, what difficulties can there be?"
    At this time, several Hungarians present talked about how diligent, eager to learn, and love of labor the Chinese farmers were.
    The Hungarian comrades working in Ziyang told me that the reason they came here was to teach the young people here to master these machines, while what we Hungarians should learn from the Chinese comrades first is the spirit of love for labor and self-sacrifice.
    I believe that it is very important in my life to have the opportunity to talk with ordinary members and leading cadres of the Communist Party of China, and to have the opportunity to understand how the wise policies of the Communist Party of China are embodied in practice and how socialist construction is carried out in China's unique circumstances.
    For example, when I was still in my country, I paid close attention to studying the Chinese Communist Party's policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation aimed at the characteristics of the Chinese national bourgeoisie. At the same time, we also carefully studied the resolutions of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China on this issue. But I still found it difficult to understand how capitalists could participate in the ranks of building socialism. In these two months, I not only had many discussions with Chinese comrades about this issue, but also had conversations with capitalists in Tianjin, Jinan, Shanghai, and other places. For me, a very important gain was to understand that the government of the People's Republic of China has not only created the political and economic possibilities that make capitalists willing to contribute their property, abilities, and technology to the cause of socialist construction, but also effectively carried out many large-scale education works aimed at making them conscious believers in socialism. I deeply feel that the Chinese Communist Party's wise and patient policy of winning over and transforming patriotic capitalists is bearing fruit.
    I say again, what I have said above is only a small part of what I have felt. But this has important lessons for us Hungarian Communists. I would like to summarize this in the following statement: on a broad democratic basis, with patient educational work, unite all patriotic forces to build socialism.
    Finally, I would like to write a little about understanding the characteristics of the Chinese people, because I think this is also my greatest experience in China.
    In Hangzhou and Guangzhou, we heard the news of the events in Hungary. When I saw the people on the streets of Guangzhou reading the newspapers posted on the walls in groups and paying attention to the development of the situation, I was really deeply moved. Because when the people of this great country were watching the fate of our small country and small nation with sympathy, I could not help but be moved by it, just like a Hungarian saying: "A friend in need is a friend indeed." Although I had spent several weeks in many cities and villages in China at that time, and I deeply felt the love of the Chinese people for us Hungarians, I still believe that only in these difficult days did I truly understand the true meaning of the friendship that links the 600 million Chinese people and the Hungarian people who are more than 10,000 kilometers away. In the past, I had never felt so truly what Comrade Peng Dehuai said to the actors of the Hungarian People's Army Art Troupe: "The Chinese people will always be with the Hungarian people."
    Internationalism, friendship, what rich content these words have! It is they that closely link the Hungarian people living in the Danube River basin and the Chinese people living in the Yangtze and Yellow River basins!

    伟大的国家，永恒的友谊
    匈牙利记者　法比扬·费伦茨
    只有现在，当我正要动笔的时候，我才感到实现当时答应要在一篇文章中总结我在中国的体会的诺言是一件不容易的事。只有现在，当我打开笔记本回想这两个月在中国所见所闻的时候，我才猛然发现这两个月来充满了如此丰富的印象和体会。要写出这些东西，并不是一篇文章而是一本书的事情。
    我到过凉爽的北方，也到过草木繁茂、天气炎热的南方；我曾在大连湾的奇石异岩之间和雄姿英发、气魄浩荡的珠江上乘舟游荡。我欣赏过泰山的瑰丽，也赞叹过杭州迷人的景色。
    我也多少接触到了一些中国和中国人民伟大的历史。北京令人惊讶的历史文物、名胜古迹向我们叙述了数千年的中国文化，南京和广州的事物告诉了我们中国的近代革命的历史。我曾在种满了法国梧桐的南京的街道上漫步，几乎那里的每一块石头上都闪耀着过去的伟大革命遗迹和太平天国起义的历史光芒。我也以沉痛的心情凭吊了雨花台上被蒋介石罪恶统治所杀害的几万先烈的陵园和被先烈热血所灌溉而发着油绿色的草木。我也以崇敬的心情晋谒了九十年前诞生的中国人民伟大儿子孙中山的陵墓。他在三十年前曾经预言：“我愿表示我热烈的希望，希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国，两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进，以取得胜利。”
    在广州时，我心中充满了不平常的感觉，因为在这里出现过第一个中国工人阶级的政权。我怀着激动的心情参观了毛泽东、周恩来、郭沫若和林伯渠等同志讲过学的农民讲习所。这个农民讲习所在中国农民运动中培养出不少优秀的领袖。
    上海也给了我难忘的印象。我拜访了被毛泽东同志称为“文化新军的最伟大和最英勇的旗手”的中国的高尔基——鲁迅度过一生中最后几年的住宅。在鲁迅纪念馆里，我们高兴和骄傲地在鲁迅所翻译的外国作家的作品中看到了裴多菲的照片。
    我为东北的重工业，为鞍山钢铁公司高度自动化的高炉和钢管厂，为抚顺不可计量的丰富的煤矿和油田，也为沈阳现代化工具厂所吸引。我还看到了伟大的建设：正在迅速建立的工厂，新的、现代化的住房，以巨大劳动建成的水坝。解放了的中国人民以自己的力量防止了数百年来为患无穷的洪水。在武汉我抚摸过横跨长江的铁梁，一年后在这百川之长的长江上将要树立起雄伟的大桥。
    我和许多中国人谈过话，其中包括工人和资本家，山东人和广东人，年青人、战士、作家、艺术家、新闻记者、共产党员和各种不同世界观的人。我看到了伟大中国人民的日常生活，我也和我的中国朋友们一起共同愉快地度过了十月一日国庆节。
    在访问中，每一次谈天，美丽的黑眼睛的中国儿童的微笑对我说来都是不可磨灭的记忆。可是谁又能把这些东西毫无遗漏地写入一篇文章中呢？
    在匈牙利，对中国和中国人民的兴趣是极为广泛的。特别是最近三四十年来，匈牙利人以极大的注意力注视着中国人民争取国家独立和为社会主义的未来而展开的英勇斗争。谁要是阅读过有关中国人民在光荣的共产党领导下所进行的英勇斗争的书籍，谁就会不由自主地滔滔不绝地向别人叙述“中国的奇迹”。中国人民在几次国内革命战争中，在史无前例的长征中所表现出来的英雄气概，中国人民在社会主义建设中所表现出来的英勇斗争，确实像奇迹似地撼动了人们的心灵。
    我在中国的这段经历中最大的收获是认识了中国人民，找到了这奇迹的答案。中国人的坚忍性、纪律性，彼此间深刻的了解，对劳动无限的热爱，无比的谦虚和热烈的爱国精神，所有这一切的确都是“中国的奇迹”的来源。
    在工厂中所见到的高度劳动纪律性给我留下了深刻的印象。在中华人民共和国，我无论到了哪里：城市或是乡村，街上或是公园里，博物馆或是娱乐场所，都要被人包围起来，他们带着巨大的兴趣向我提出很多问题。但在工厂里情况就不一样。无论我走到哪里，或是和某一个工人作一些简单的交谈，周围没有一个工人会因此停止一刹那的工作。这看来似乎是一件小事情，对于已经习惯了高度劳动纪律的中国人来说也许会对于我连这件小事也提出来而感到奇怪。但我还是认为解放以来所达到的成绩，是和这种自觉的劳动纪律分不开的。
    到中国后不久，我就到沈阳第一机床厂去参观，厂里的林金玉同志告诉我说，他们的第一个五年计划已在去年10月1日，也就是比计划提前一年零三个月完成了。老实说，当时我认为他们的计划也许是订低了，但此后我知道，用中国人的劳动热情和纪律性来达到这样的成绩并不是什么奇怪的事。因此在武汉当我听到长江大桥要在今年末——比计划提早一年完成时，我几乎已认为是理所当然的事了。
    记得在山东省滋阳县中匈友谊农业机器拖拉机站的一次谈话里，农场杨场长热情地给我们讲述在农场工作的匈牙利专家们是如何忘我地在工作，并且在几个月中就培养出许多经过训练的小组。
    匈牙利的一位专家阿尔巴特·维莱斯同志诚恳果断地向我说：“同这样的人民在一起，还会有什么困难吗？”
    这时在场的几个匈牙利人就一个接一个地都谈起了中国农民是如何勤劳、好学和热爱劳动。
    在滋阳工作的匈牙利同志们告诉我说，他们所以来到这儿就是为了教会这儿青年们掌握这些机器，而对我们匈牙利人来说首先应该向中国同志们学习的却是热爱劳动和自我牺牲的精神。
    我认为在我一生的经历中很重要的，就是能有机会同中国共产党的普通的党员和领导干部进行交谈，有机会了解中国共产党的英明政策是如何在实际中得到体现和如何在中国特有的情况下进行社会主义建设。
    举个例子来说吧：当我还在国内的时候，就很留心研究中国共产党针对中国民族资产阶级特点而采取了利用、限制和改造的政策。同时我们也仔细地研究了中国共产党第八次代表大会关于这方面的决议。可是我还是难以理解资本家们如何参加到建设社会主义的行列中去。在这两个月中，关于这个问题我不仅和中国同志们进行了多次的讨论，而且在天津、济南、上海等地和资本家们也进行了交谈。对我说来一个极为重要的收获，就是了解到中华人民共和国政府不仅在政治上和经济上创造了使资本家们愿意把财产、能力和技术贡献给社会主义建设事业的可能性，同时还有效地进行了许多旨在使他们成为社会主义自觉信仰者的、大规模的教育工作。我深深感到中国共产党对争取和改造爱国资本家的英明而耐心的政策正在开花结实。
    我再说一遍，上面所说的只不过是我所感到的其中的一点。但是这对于我们匈牙利共产党员却有着重要的教益。我想把这东西可以总结为下列的说法：在广阔的民主基础上，用耐心的教育工作，团结所有的爱国力量，建设社会主义。
    最后，还想写一点对中国人特点的了解，因为我认为这也是我在中国的最大体会。
    在杭州和广州时，我们听到了匈牙利发生事件的消息。当我看到广州的街上人们成群地读着张贴在墙上的报纸、注意着局势的发展的时候，我实在深为感动。因为当这伟大国家的人民怀着同情心注视着我们小国小民族的命运的时候，我不能不为之感动，这正像匈牙利常说的一句俗话：“患难见朋友”。虽然在那时我已经在中国的许多城市和乡村度过了好几个星期，我也深深地感觉到中国人民对我们匈牙利人的爱，但我还是认为只有在这些艰难的日子里，才真正懂得了把这六亿人口的中国和远离一万多公里的匈牙利人民联结在一起的友谊的真正内容。在过去也从未如此真切地体会到如像彭德怀同志对匈牙利人民军文工团的演员所说的这句话：“中国人民永远和匈牙利人民在一起。”
    国际主义，友谊，这些字的内容是多么丰富啊，正是它们把住在多瑙河流域的匈牙利人民和住在长江、黄河流域的中国人民紧紧地联在一起！
