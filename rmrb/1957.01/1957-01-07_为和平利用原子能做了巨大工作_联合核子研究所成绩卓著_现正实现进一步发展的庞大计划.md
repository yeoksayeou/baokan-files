Xinhua News Agency, 6th: According to TASS, "Pravda" reported on the 4th the work of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, located in Dubna, a newly built city near Moscow.

    The newspaper wrote that scientists from the Soviet Union and eleven People's Democratic countries are now working together at the institute. From the very first days when the scientists began working together, the institute has been filled with an atmosphere of mutual respect and friendship, demonstrating the fraternal relations between the member countries.

    The institute has already done a great deal of work in the peaceful use of atomic energy. Now the scientists are preparing to convene a meeting to study the application of photographic emulsions in experiments, and to study how to further improve this reliable method of studying the microcosm. It is expected that this photographic emulsion will be of great significance in a new work in the Nuclear Problem Laboratory, namely in the study of mesons, in discovering the regularities of the interaction of these particles with the atomic nucleus and with the protons and neutrons within the atomic nucleus. This work will be carried out on the existing synchrocyclotron.

    At present, the institute's synchrophasotron can accelerate protons to 10 billion electron volts, exceeding the 4 billion electron volts of the Bevatron at the Berkeley Atomic Center in the United States. Its ring electromagnet weighs 36 tons. This powerful synchrophasotron opens up broader prospects for the institute's scientists to delve deeper into the interior of the atomic nucleus.

    The institute is implementing a vast plan for further development, building new laboratories and equipping existing laboratories with modern equipment.

    "Pravda" wrote that the activities of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research are a good example of friendship and cooperation among scientists from various countries. It is not only willing to share the fruits of its research with scientists from all countries, but also pays attention to the achievements of physicists around the world. The institute is expanding its contacts with scientific institutions in many countries. It has already received scientists from many countries. The institute's doors are also open to other countries that wish to become its members.

    为和平利用原子能做了巨大工作
    联合核子研究所成绩卓著
    现正实现进一步发展的庞大计划
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社报道：“真理报”4日报道了设在莫斯科近郊一座新建的杜勃纳城内的联合核子研究所的工作情形。
    报纸写道，现在，苏联和十一个人民民主国家的科学家在研究所里共同工作。从科学家们开始一起工作的头几天起，研究所里面就充满了一种互相尊重和友谊的气氛，表现了会员国之间的兄弟关系。
    研究所在和平利用原子能方面已经做了巨大的工作。现在科学家们正筹备召开会议，研究实验中应用照相乳剂的问题，研究如何进一步改进研究微观世界的这种可靠方法。预料这种照相乳剂在核子问题实验室的一项新工作，即在研究介子方面，在发现这些粒子同原子核之间以及同原子核内的质子、中子之间相互影响的规律性方面将具有重要的意义。这些工作将在现有的同步回旋加速器上进行。
    目前研究所的同步稳相加速器可以把质子加速到一百亿电子伏特，超过美国柏克莱原子中心装置的极小电子运动加速器四十亿电子伏特。它的环形电磁铁有三十六吨重。这个效能强大的同步稳相加速器给研究所的科学家们在深入研究原子核的内部方面开辟了更加广阔的远景。
    研究所正在实现进一步发展的庞大计划，正在兴建新的实验室和用现代设备充实原有的实验室。
    “真理报”写道：联合核子研究所的活动是各国科学家友好和合作的良好范例。它不仅愿意同各国科学家们分享自己研究的成果，同时也注意研究世界物理学家们的成就。研究所正在同许多国家的科学机构扩大联系。它已经接待了来自许多国家的科学家。研究所的大门对愿意成为它的会员的其他国家也是敞开的。
