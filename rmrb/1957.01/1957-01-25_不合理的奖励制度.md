    Unreasonable Reward System
    Since 1956, the Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation has implemented a quarterly reward system for technical personnel and staff who complete their tasks. The amount of bonus each person receives is determined by the level of their position. For example, it is stipulated that the general manager and deputy general manager of the corporation should receive 100% of their monthly salary as a bonus, department heads (including engineering company managers) 90%, deputy department heads and section chiefs (including engineering company deputy managers) 70%, deputy section chiefs 60%, and general technical personnel and staff 50%.
    Although technical personnel and staff do not directly participate in production and construction, they are an indispensable force in production and construction. Therefore, they should also be rewarded when production and construction are successful. However, why should the level of position be the principle for distributing bonuses? The reason given is that the higher the position, the wider the scope of work and the heavier the task, so the more bonus should be received.
    I think this argument is not entirely reasonable. Because it is the masses of workers who directly create wealth, and the success of various economic indicators largely depends on the grass-roots foremen, section chiefs, and team leaders who directly lead production and construction. Of course, the role of leading cadres and functional departments serving production and construction cannot be denied, but the role of leading cadres should not be overemphasized. Otherwise, it will alienate leading cadres from the masses and affect the enthusiasm of grass-roots cadres. For example, since 1956, the Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation has completed the state plan for three consecutive quarters. The average monthly salary of department-level cadres is around 160 yuan, and the average monthly salary of the general manager of the corporation is over 200 yuan. If bonuses are issued according to their stipulated bonus rate, then how much income should each person receive in these three quarters! And those grass-roots foremen, section chiefs, and team leader-level cadres only receive bonuses equivalent to about 32% of their monthly salary. If an accident occurs in a month, or if one indicator is not completed, the bonus will be deducted. I think this reward system is very unreasonable and should be changed.　Jian Wen

    不合理的奖励制度
    鞍山冶金建设总公司从1956年以来，实行了一种技术人员和职员完成任务的季度奖励制度。每个人获得奖金多少，决定于职务的高低。如规定总公司正副经理所得奖金应为本人月工薪的100％，处长（包括工程公司经理）为90％，副处长、科长（包括工程公司副经理）为70％，副科长为60％，一般技术人员和职员为50％。
    技术人员和职员虽然不直接参加生产建设，但是他们是生产建设中一支不可缺少的力量，因此，生产建设搞好了，他们也应该受到奖励。但是，为什么要按职务的高低作为分配奖金的原则呢？据说理由是：职务越高，工作范围越广，任务越重，因此奖金也应该得的越多。
    我认为这种说法是不尽合理的。因为直接创造财富的是工人群众，各项经济指标完成得好坏，在很大程度上决定于直接领导生产建设的基层工长、工段长、队长。当然，领导干部和为生产建设服务的职能机构人员的作用也不能否定，但是不应过分地强调领导干部的作用。否则就会使领导干部脱离群众，影响基层干部的积极性。如鞍山冶金建设总公司从1956年以来，连续三个季度完成了国家计划，处长级干部月薪平均都在一百六十元左右，总公司经理月薪平均都在二百元以上，如果按照他们规定的奖金率发给奖金，那么这三个季度，每人该得多么大的一笔收入啊！而那些基层工长、工段长，队长级干部，所得奖金只相当于月薪收入的32％左右。如果在一个月里发生了 事故，或有一个指标没有完成，还得扣奖。我认为，这种奖励制度很不合理，应该改变。　见闻
