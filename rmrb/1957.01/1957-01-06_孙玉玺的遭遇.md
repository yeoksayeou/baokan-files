    I remember very clearly that on a spring evening two years ago, at the Tianqiao Theater in Beijing, the audience was applauding a six-year-old child standing in the center of the stage. This young actor from Jilin Province, who came to participate in the National Mass Amateur Music and Dance Performance, had just finished playing a Huqin solo and was smiling, his chubby face tilted upwards, holding the Huqin, which was almost as tall as he was, and bowing to thank the audience.

    Perhaps many people still remember his name: Sun Yuxi.

    The audience in the capital welcomed this son of a railway worker with such great enthusiasm and interest at that time. Newspapers published interviews with him, and magazines published his photos. Musicians and audiences were also surprised and delighted by the emergence of this talented musical child, and congratulated him.

    More than a year later, to allow the concerned masses to know about his recent situation, a magazine's editorial department recently wrote a letter to Sun Yuxi's father, inquiring about his studies and life, preparing to report on him. However, after the reply came, the editorial department received a very unpleasant, even infuriating, message.

    After returning from Beijing, Sun Yuxi became a local "celebrity." In November of the year before last, he also followed the Jilin Railway delegation to Changchun to participate in the Jilin Provincial Workers' Amateur Arts Performance. The performance tasks during the festival were very tight, exhausting even adults, let alone children. However, the person in charge of the delegation, in order to "unify collective life and strive for the discipline banner," treated the six-year-old Sun Yuxi as an adult. In addition to performing, he also had to brave the wind and snow with everyone else to attend meetings in the east and listen to reports in the west. In addition, perhaps to win the "honor" of the whole delegation, before one performance, a person in charge of the delegation insisted that Sun Yuxi play a relatively complicated piece that he did not know at all, and asked him to "learn and practice on the spot" in a small room backstage. The poor child tearfully begged to be spared. But besides these physical and mental tortures, even the reception dances held during the festival required the child to perform. While the dancers were partying late into the night, the child had to wait beside them until late into the night. The child couldn't bear it and fell off his chair onto the floor...

    Thus, as soon as the festival was over, the child fell ill in bed when he returned home! Then his father unfortunately had to stop working due to illness, and a family of seven could only make ends meet with meager labor insurance payments. The cost of medicine for the child could only be maintained by pawning the family's musical instruments, such as the Huqin, Sanxian, Yueqin, and even the child's prizes and banners!

    Is it true that no one understands Sun Yuxi's desolate situation? Not really. After Sun Yuxi fell ill, his father reported the situation to the deputy head of the Jilin Railway delegation that participated in the provincial arts performance. The deputy head "threw a tantrum," and Sun Yuxi's father didn't have the courage to finish speaking. The Jilin Provincial Department of Culture also knew about Sun Yuxi's situation; but besides writing a very sincere letter of condolence, there was no other expression.

    So the child had to remain sick in the absence of normal nutrition and medical conditions, unable to recover for a long time. Although he was already of school age, he could not attend school because of his poor health!

    This is Sun Yuxi's recent situation!

    Recently, I saw news in the newspapers about the discovery of musical children in other regions. This was originally a pleasing thing, but considering Sun Yuxi's plight, I can't help but worry about them. Nevertheless, I still believe that the children of New China will grow up happily. People will not remain silent about Sun Yuxi's plight. Relevant parties will definitely help him and extend a helping hand to him.

    孙玉玺的遭遇
    凡工
    我还记得很清楚，前年春天的那个夜晚，在北京天桥剧场内，观众正朝着站在舞台中央的一个六岁小孩子鼓掌。这个从吉林省来参加全国群众业余音乐舞蹈观摩演出会的小演员，刚演奏完一曲胡琴独奏，正仰着微笑着的胖胖的小脸，提着和他差不多一样高的胡琴，向观众鞠躬致谢。
    也许许多人都还记得他的名字：孙玉玺。
    首都的观众们，那时候以那么大的热情和兴趣欢迎这个铁路职工的儿子。报纸上发表了关于他的访问记，画报上也刊登了他的照片。音乐家们和观众也为这个有才能的音乐儿童的出现而惊喜，为他庆幸。
    事隔一年多以后，有一个画报编辑部为了使关心他的广大群众能知道他的近况，不久前，写了一封信给孙玉玺的父亲，询问他的学习和生活情形，准备报道。但是回信来了以后，编辑部却得到了一个极不愉快甚至令人愤慨的消息。
    从北京回去以后，孙玉玺就成了地方上的“红人”。前年11月，他又随吉林铁路代表团到长春参加吉林省的职工业余文艺观摩演出会。会演期间的演出任务十分紧，连成年人都疲惫不堪，更别说小孩子了。但是团里的负责人为了“统一集体生活，争取纪律奖旗”，却把六岁的孙玉玺也当成大人看待，除了演出之外，他也得和大家一道，冒着风雪，赶到东去开会，赶到西去听报告。此外，大概也是为了争得全团的
  “荣誉”吧，在某一次演出前，团里的一位负责人又硬要孙玉玺演奏一段他根本不会拉的一个比较复杂的曲子，让他在后台的一间小房里“现学现练”，可怜的孩子眼泪汪汪地苦苦哀求才罢。但是除了这些肉体上和精神上的摧残还不算，连会演期间举行的招待舞会，也要让孩子去演奏。跳舞的人玩到深夜，孩子也得在旁边等候到深夜。孩子实在支持不了，困得从椅子上掉到地板上来……。
    就这样，会演一完，孩子回到家里就病倒在床上了！接着他的父亲又不幸因病停职，一家七口人只能靠微薄的劳保费糊口，孩子吃药的用费，就只能靠典卖家中的乐器，如胡琴、三弦、月琴，甚至孩子所得奖品、奖旗等来维持了！
    是不是真没有人了解孙玉玺的凄凉的处境呢？倒也不是。孙玉玺病后，他的父亲就向参加省的文艺观摩演出会的吉林铁路代表团副团长反映过情况，副团长却“大发态度”，孙玉玺的父亲也就没有勇气把话说完了。吉林省文化局也知道孙玉玺的情况；但除了写了一封词意十分恳切的慰问信以外，也就没有旁的表示了。
    于是这个孩子只好在缺乏正常营养，缺乏医药条件的情况下病着，久久不能复元。虽然他已经是学龄儿童了，却因为身体不好不能入学！
    这就是孙玉玺的近况！
    最近，从报纸上看到其它地区发现了音乐儿童的消息，这本来是可欣喜的事，但从孙玉玺的遭遇来看，我总不禁为他们担忧。尽管如此，我仍旧相信，新中国的儿童是会幸福地成长起来的。对于孙玉玺的遭遇，人们是不会沉默的。有关方面一定会帮助他，向他伸出援助的手来。
