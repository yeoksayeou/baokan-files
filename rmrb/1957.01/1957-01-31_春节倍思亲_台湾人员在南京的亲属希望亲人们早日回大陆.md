Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 30th - Relatives of Taiwanese personnel in Nanjing miss their loved ones. At a recent symposium held by the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the CPPCC, many elderly people with relatives in Taiwan expressed their desire for their loved ones to return and for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan to be realized soon, with the sentiment of "missing relatives more during festivals."

Zhou Yaoting has two sons in Taiwan and has not heard from them since 1952. He is currently living alone in Nanjing. He tearfully recounted his lonely life in old age and expressed his desire to see his sons return soon. Bao Liren's eldest son is a professor at Nanjing University and has a good life with his family. The biggest regret is that there is no news of his second son in Taiwan, which often makes him and his wife feel longing. Tu Yueyin said that she has two sons, the elder one is a lieutenant officer in the People's Liberation Army, and the younger one has been stranded in Taiwan for more than seven years, which makes her worry about him day and night. During the meeting, many relatives of Taiwanese personnel in Nanjing expressed their hope for the early realization of the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and stated that they would contribute their share to the realization of the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

Liao Yunze, Deputy Secretary-General of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, presided over the symposium. He used his personal experience to explain the policy of peaceful liberation of Taiwan in detail. He said, "I am a graduate of the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy and former commander of the Second Cavalry Army of the Kuomintang. After returning to the motherland in 1952, I have been deeply cared for and looked after by the government and have a good life."
