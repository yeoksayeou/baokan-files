    Incorrect Criticism Produces Negative Results
    On February 14, 1956, the Reader's Letters page of this newspaper published a letter from Comrade Wang Zhongxing and others of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, exposing Fang Fumei, a nursery worker and Communist Youth League member at the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics Kindergarten, for brutally beating her mother-in-law, blinding her left eye, and stating that Fang Fumei and her husband, Communist Party member Fan Dong'an, frequently abused the elderly woman. On the May 13th Reader's Letters page, a letter from the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics Party Committee was published, stating that Fang Fumei had already received administrative punishment and had been expelled from the League. In October, this newspaper received a letter from Comrades Huang Guozhen and two others of the Beijing Municipal Higher Education Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, stating that based on their investigation of this incident, the situation revealed by the readers did not match the facts, and that the alleged frequent abuse of the elderly woman was largely untrue. The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law were not on good terms and both were responsible, but Fang Fumei should bear the main responsibility for beating her mother-in-law, but the mother-in-law's eyes were not blinded. This newspaper contacted the Beijing Municipal Higher Education Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and they explained that they had already suggested that the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League re-examine the punishment of Fang Fumei and resolve her work issues, and had also corrected the incorrect Party disciplinary action against Fan Dong'an.
    This newspaper is willing to learn from the lessons of this incident and will strengthen the investigation and verification of criticism in the future.

    不正确的批评产生了恶果
    1956年2月14日本报读者来信专页刊载了北京航空学院王中兴等同志的来信，揭发北京航空学院幼儿园保育员、青年团员方馥梅毒打婆婆，把婆婆的左眼打瞎了，并说方馥梅和她的丈夫、共产党员樊东安平日多方虐待老人。在5月13日读者来信专页上，又刊出了中共北京航空学院委员会的来信，说方馥梅已经受到行政处分并被开除团籍。10月间，本报收到了中共北京市高等学校委员会黄国珍等三同志的来信，根据他们对这一事件的调查，指出读者揭发的情况，与事实有出入，所谓多方虐待老人，大都不是事实。婆媳之间平日不睦，互有责任，殴打婆婆一事，方馥梅应负主要责任，但婆婆眼睛并未被打瞎。本报并同中共北京市高等学校委员会联系，他们说明已经建议北京市团委复查对方馥梅的处分，并解决她的工作问题，也已经纠正了对樊东安的不正确的党内处分。
    本报愿接受这一事件的教训，今后加强对批评的调查核对工作。
