Responses to Criticism

Comrade Shi Feng, the County Head of Jieyu County, Shanxi Province, wrote: The People’s Daily article "Who is Really Being Undisciplined and Unorganized?" on August 31, 1956, criticized my ideological and work style problems. Although the situation was somewhat different from the truth, it made me pay attention to it in my future work. The article "Caused by Registered Mail" on page three of your newspaper on June 6 of the same year, which discussed the issue of our county stopping the work of demobilized soldier Comrade Guo Dequan, should not be the responsibility of Deputy County Head Wang, but should be my primary responsibility. I have already conducted a self-criticism regarding this matter. Comrade Guo Dequan has been reinstated, and all back wages have been paid.

    对批评的反应
    山西省解虞县县长史峰同志来信：1956年8月31日人民日报“究竟是谁无组织无纪律”一文，批评我的思想作风问题，情况虽有点出入，但使我在今后工作中引起注意。同年6月6日你报第三版“由挂号引起的”一文所谈到的我县停止复员军人郭德全同志工作的问题，不应由王副县长负责，应由我负主要责任。对此我已作了检讨。郭德全同志已恢复工作，工资全部补发。
