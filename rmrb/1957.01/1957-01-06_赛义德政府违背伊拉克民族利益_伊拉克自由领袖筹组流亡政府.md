Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 4th - According to a report from the “Republic” newspaper's correspondent in Damascus on January 2nd, free leaders inside and outside Iraq are already making contact, preparing to form an Iraqi government-in-exile in the near future, with Kamel al-Jadirji as Prime Minister.

The message stated that an Iraqi free leader currently abroad will serve as Jadirji's representative, as Jadirji is currently being detained in Baghdad.

The proposed government headquarters will be located in the capital of a Middle Eastern country. It will announce Iraq's withdrawal from the Baghdad Pact, sever diplomatic relations with Britain, recognize the People's Republic of China, restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, and declare Iraq's loyalty to the Bandung Conference principles. It will also demand that all countries recognize it as the legitimate government of Iraq.

    伊拉克自由领袖筹组流亡政府
    新华社开罗4日电　据“共和国报”驻大马士革记者2日报道，在伊拉克国内外的自由领袖已经在进行接触，准备在最近组织由卡迈勒·贾达吉担任首相的伊拉克流亡政府。
    消息说，现在国外的一个伊拉克的自由领袖将担任贾达吉的代表，因为贾达吉现在被拘留在巴格达。
    建议中的政府总部将设在一个中东国家的首都。它将宣布伊拉克退出巴格达条约，同英国断绝外交关系，承认中华人民共和国，同苏联恢复外交关系，并且宣布伊拉克忠于万隆会议原则。它还将要求所有国家承认它是伊拉克的合法政府。
