    Large Purchase and Sale Price Differences, Many Business Links
    In Tongxian Special District, Hebei Province, the large purchase and sale price differences of many locally produced and sold commodities are detrimental to the development of production. For example, the purchase and wholesale price difference rate for thirteen major medicinal materials such as local Atractylodes lancea, Bupleurum, and Anemarrhena asphodeloides is 55%, and the price difference rate for minor medicinal materials is as high as 73.1%. Farmers receive 0.26 yuan per catty of Anemarrhena asphodeloides, while the wholesale price is 0.41 yuan. Among local products and non-staple foods, the purchase and sale price difference rate for reed mats is 35.5%, the purchase and sale price difference rate for miscellaneous grain vermicelli is 65%, and the purchase and sale price difference rate for honey is as high as 123.9%.

    Due to the excessive purchase and sale price differences, farmers' interest in sideline production such as medicinal materials has decreased. Because a medium-level laborer can earn about two yuan a day by chopping firewood or cutting Vitex negundo branches, but only earns 0.6 to 0.8 yuan a day by collecting medicinal materials. Therefore, this year, the procurement tasks for medicinal materials and honey in this area have not been completed well.

    The reason for the excessive purchase and sale price differences is mainly that the multi-level management system of the supply and marketing cooperatives violates the natural flow of commodities and increases commodity circulation costs. For example, after the primary-level supply and marketing cooperative purchases medicinal materials, it must add 6.34% for direct commodity circulation costs, 3.9% for operating and management expenses, and 6.336% for profit; then hand the medicine over to the county cooperative; the county cooperative then adds 4.54% for direct expenses, 3.9% for operating and management expenses, and 2.64% for profit, and hands it over to the special district medicinal material purchasing station; the special district medicinal material purchasing station then adds 9.54% for direct expenses, 3.4% for operating and management expenses, and 1.5% for profit before wholesaling it to various counties for sale. Another example is that Xianghe County is only one hundred and thirty li away from Jixian County, which produces mats, but the primary-level supply and marketing cooperative in Xianghe County cannot directly buy mats from the primary-level cooperative in the mat-producing area of Jixian County, but instead the primary-level cooperative in Jixian County must purchase the mats and hand them over to the Jixian County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, which hands them over to the Tongxian Special District Cooperative, which transfers them to the Xianghe County Cooperative and then allocates them to their primary-level cooperatives for sale. Every business link that the mats pass through adds a profit. In this way, after the commodity makes a detour, a first-class mat costs 1.9 yuan in Jixian County, but is sold for 2.61 yuan in Xianghe.

    Now, the Tongxian Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative is mobilizing its employees to continue to examine these shortcomings and has begun to formulate improvement measures. I suggest that commercial departments in various places inspect and correct these unreasonable phenomena. Yang Huaiqing

### 购销差价大经营环节多

    购销差价大经营环节多
    河北省通县专区许多地产地销商品的购销差价过大，不利于生产的发展。例如当地产的玉术、柴胡、知母肉等十三种大宗药材的收购与批发差价率是55％，小药材的差价率竟达73.1％。收农民一斤知母肉给二角六分，批发价却是四角一分。土产副食中的苇席购销差价率是35.5％，杂粮粉条购销差价率是65％，蜂蜜购销差价率竟高达123.9％。
    由于购销差价过大，农民对药材等副业生产的兴趣降低了。因为一个中等劳动力如果去打柴或割荆条，一天可以收入两元左右，如果采集药材，一天才收入六角至八角。所以今年这个地区的药材、蜂蜜等收购任务完成得很不好。
    购销差价过大的原因，主要是供销社的多层经营制度违背了商品的自然流转规律，加大了商品的流转费用。比如基层供销社购进药材后，要加6.34％的商品流转直接费用，3.9％的经营管理费和6.336％的利润；把药交到县社；县社再加4.54％的直接费用，3.9％的经营管理费和2.64％的利润，交到专区药材采购站；专区药材采购站再加9.54％的直接费用，3.4％的经营管理费和1.5％的利润然后才批发给各县出售。又如香河县离产席的蓟县只有一百三十华里，香河县的基层供销社却不可以直接到蓟县产席区的基层社去买席，而要由蓟县的基层社把席子收购上来交给蓟县供销社，县社交到通县专区社，转给香河县社再拨给他们的基层社出售。凡是席子经过的经营环节，都要加一次利润。商品这样一绕湾，一片甲字丈席在蓟县是一元九角，而在香河售价二元六角一分。
    现在，通县专区供销社正在发动职工继续检查这些缺点，并且开始拟定改进的办法。我建议各地商业部门都来检查和纠正这些不合理现象。　杨怀清
