Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 6th: In 1956, over 110,000 advanced producers and advanced workers emerged from industrial enterprises in Jiangsu Province; over 9,500 units were awarded the titles of advanced workshops, advanced offices, and advanced groups.

The development of the advanced producer movement has made the socialist competition in Jiangsu Province's industrial enterprises more widespread and in-depth. According to a survey conducted in the third quarter of last year among more than 3,300 factories and mines, over 480,000 employees formulated competition conditions to ensure the completion of the state plan; more than 1,000 factories and mines across the province participated in national, provincial, and regional inter-factory competitions, with over 310,000 employees.

During the advanced producer movement, mass technical learning and technical mutual assistance activities were very active. Advanced driving backward, and backward catching up with advanced, has become a trend in many enterprises. In the Lixin Textile Factory in Wuxi City, 80% of the workers who signed technical mutual assistance contracts improved their technical skills. Technical mutual assistance activities in some areas have developed from between workers to between enterprises. In Wuxi City alone, 48 enterprises signed inter-factory mutual assistance contracts, and 15 units signed inter-factory mutual assistance contracts for the same type of work or business. Nanjing, Wuxi and other regions also held advanced experience schools. In the electrical and other 15 industrial systems, 843 advanced experiences are being promoted.

Over the past year, the broad masses of employees have also put forward a large number of rationalization proposals in the advanced producer movement, of which 6,876 have saved the country more than 4 million yuan.

At present, the broad masses of employees in the province are implementing the policy of increasing production and practicing economy, and are preparing to achieve greater achievements on the production front.

    先进带动落后落后赶上先进成为风气
    江苏各厂矿去年出现十一万多名先进生产者
    新华社南京6日电　江苏省工业企业1956年涌现出十一万多名先进生产者、先进工作者；获得先进车间、先进科室和先进小组称号的有九千五百多个单位。
    先进生产者运动的开展，使江苏省工业企业社会主义竞赛发展得更广泛更深入。据去年第三季度在三千三百多个厂矿企业中的调查，有四十八万多职工制定了保证完成国家计划的竞赛条件；全省参加全国性、全省性和地区性厂际竞赛的厂矿企业有一千多个，职工人数达三十一万多人。
    在先进生产者运动中，群众性的学习技术和技术互助活动很活跃。先进带动落后，落后赶先进，在很多企业中已经成为一种风气。无锡市丽新纺织厂在签定技术互助合同的工人中，有80％的人提高了技术水平。有些地区的技术互助活动已经从工人之间发展到企业之间。仅无锡市签定厂际互助合同的企业就有四十八个，签定厂际同工种或同业务的互助合同的单位有十五个。南京、无锡等地区还举办了先进经验学校。在电业等十五个产业系统中，正在推广的先进经验有八百四十三项。
    一年来，广大职工在先进生产者运动中还提出了大量的合理化建议，其中的六千八百七十六件就为国家节约了四百多万元。
    目前，全省广大职工正在贯彻执行增产节约的方针，准备在生产战线上获得更大的成绩。
