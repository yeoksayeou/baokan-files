Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 27th: Egyptian Intelligence Director Hatem, commenting on UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld's report on Israeli troop withdrawal on the 26th, said: "Egypt has always been willing to fulfill the armistice agreement, while Israel has been trying to create tension to achieve the political goals of its rulers."

Hatem said that since February 1955, Israel had turned Negev into a military base in order to launch attacks on Gaza, Saba, Qontilla, and Khan Yunis, and had also launched a joint three-nation invasion of Egypt.

Egyptian newspapers on the 26th, commenting on Hammarskjöld's report, universally warned that the United Nations must quickly put into effect the resolution stipulating the withdrawal of Israeli troops, otherwise it would cause serious consequences.

Sadat, editor-in-chief of "The Republic," wrote in the newspaper: "If an inch of land in Gaza or Sinai is placed under the control of non-Egyptians, that is, of course, a continuation of aggression." He said: "This gives us the full right to stop such aggression ourselves."

"Al Ahram" said that Israel's continued occupation of the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba is an international disaster that could undermine the prestige of the United Nations.

"Al Gomhuria" said that the United Nations should take measures to let the whole world see that it can correct the mistake of a country that attacks another country in disregard of the UN Charter. It said that if the United Nations cannot make Israel fulfill the United Nations resolution, then "it will declare its own death sentence, just like the League of Nations in the past."

Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: TASS, Damascus, January 27th: Commenting on Israel's failure to implement the UN resolution on withdrawing from Egypt, "Al-Raya" wrote that Israel's attitude is supported by the United States. The newspaper said that the United States is trying to use the issue of withdrawing Israeli troops to bargain with the Arab people and force them to accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

    埃及指责以色列破坏停战协定
    叙报揭露美国支持以色列拒绝撤军
    新华社开罗27日电　埃及情报司长哈特姆26日在评论联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德关于以色列撤军的报告时说：“埃及一向愿意履行停战协定，而以色列却一直在设法制造紧张局势，以达到它的统治者的政治目的。”
    哈特姆说，以色列自从1955年2月起就把尼加夫变为军事基地，以便对加沙、萨巴、孔蒂拉和汉尤尼斯发动袭击，并且又对埃及发动了三国的联合侵略。
    埃及各报26日在评论哈马舍尔德的报告时，普遍警告联合国必须迅速使规定以色列撤军的决议生效，否则将要造成严重后果。
    “共和国报”主编萨达特在这家报纸上发表的文章说：“如果加沙或西奈有一寸土地被置于非埃及人的控制之下，那当然就是侵略的继续。”他说：“这就给予我们自己来制止这种侵略的充分权利。”
    “金字塔报”说，以色列继续占领加沙地区和亚喀巴湾地区是一个可能破坏联合国威信的国际灾难。
    “今日消息”说，联合国应该采取措施使全世界看到，它能够纠正一个不顾联合国宪章而攻击别国的国家的错误。它说，如果联合国不能使以色列履行联合国的决议，那么“它就将宣告它自己的死刑，就像过去的国际联盟一样”。
    新华社27日讯　塔斯社大马士革27日讯：“旗帜报”在评论以色列不执行联合国关于从埃及撤军的决议的时候写道，以色列的这种态度是得到美国的支持的。这家报纸说，美国企图利用撤退以色列军队的问题同阿拉伯人民讨价还价，强迫他们同意接受“艾森豪威尔主义”。
