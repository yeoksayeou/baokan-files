Ganzi Under Construction

Ganzi, the capital of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province, is an important passage on the Kangding-Tibet Highway. As early as 1935, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army passed through here on its way north to fight against the Japanese and helped the Tibetan people establish the "Boba Government" (i.e., the Tibetan People's Government).

After several years of construction, new buildings have sprung up in the city of Ganzi, and the population has also increased. Han workers who have come to support the construction are working enthusiastically with the local Tibetan people to build this ancient city into an even more beautiful one.

    在建设中的甘孜
    四川省甘孜藏族自治州的首府甘孜，是康藏公路的重要孔道。早在1935年，中国工农红军北上抗日时曾经路过这里，帮助藏族人民建立了“博巴政府”（即藏族人民政府）。
