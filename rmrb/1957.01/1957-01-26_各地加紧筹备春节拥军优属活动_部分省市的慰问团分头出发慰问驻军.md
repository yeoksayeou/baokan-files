Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: The activities of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary armymen, which will be widely launched across the country around the Spring Festival, are being actively prepared by relevant departments in various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities.

This support-the-army and give-preference-to-families activity is being carried out according to the State Council's notice. According to statistics, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Hebei, Henan, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu, Beijing, Tianjin, and other provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities have successively issued notices or instructions regarding the carrying out of support-the-army and give-preference-to-families activities. Some provinces and cities have already formed慰问团 and begun to慰问 the border defense, coastal defense, and construction troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Leading members of the Hubei Provincial People's Committee and its subordinate units, various democratic parties, and people's organizations have formed慰问团 separately and will begin on the 25th to go deep into the grass-roots units such as companies and hospitals of the local駐軍 to give reports and hold symposiums. The Provincial People's Committee has also organized fourteen 慰问团, led by Governor Zhang Tixue, various Deputy Governors, and the Mayor of Wuhan, to visit the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Hubei Province. Around the Spring Festival, various organs and schools in Hubei Province will also invite responsible cadres from the local駐軍 to give reports introducing the heroic deeds of the People's Army's hard struggle, so as to conduct revolutionary tradition education of hard work and simplicity among the broad masses of cadres and youth. The 慰问团 organized by the People's Committees of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces and the Guangzhou驻軍leadership organs have set off separately to慰问 coastal defense, border defense, and other troops.

慰问 activities for families of martyrs, families of military personnel, and disabled soldiers are also being actively prepared in various locations. Shandong, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and other provinces have decided to hold representative conferences of families of martyrs, families of military personnel, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers around the Spring Festival, with counties and cities as units, to convey the spirit of the National Congress of Activists in Socialist Construction of Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Soldiers, and Demobilized Soldiers, and to listen to their opinions. Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Guangdong, and other provinces will issue a batch of preferential treatment expenses before the Spring Festival to help families of martyrs, families of military personnel, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers with difficult lives celebrate the Spring Festival happily. The agricultural cooperatives in Ruijin County, the old revolutionary base area in Jiangxi Province, will soon rationally adjust the preferential workdays for families of martyrs and families of military personnel and establish preferential treatment groups. Various locations in Sichuan Province have decided to mobilize the masses, especially the youth, to carry out activities to do something for families of martyrs, families of military personnel, disabled soldiers, and wounded and sick soldiers around the Spring Festival. Some areas will also sweep and pay respects at the tombs of revolutionary martyrs around the festival.

Many areas are preparing to comprehensively inspect the work of preferential treatment and demobilization resettlement. Currently, the inspection work in Hebei, Henan, and other provinces has already begun. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has decided to first inspect the situation of preferential workdays for families of martyrs and families of military personnel before and after the festival, and to evaluate the preferential workdays for this year household by household. Shandong Province has decided to establish "Support-the-Army and Give-Preference-to-Families Pledges" through inspections before and after the Spring Festival, with resident committees in cities as units and cooperatives or production teams in rural areas as units, so as to regularly do a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary armymen.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, January 25th: Nanchang City, the birthplace of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, is carrying out activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of revolutionary armymen.

On the 25th, a visiting delegation composed of more than 300 people, including leaders and cadres from the Nanchang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the government, visited families of martyrs and families of military personnel door-to-door throughout the city. Zhang Yunqiao, the Mayor of Nanchang City, visited eight families of martyrs and families of military personnel and had cordial conversations with them. The families of martyrs and families of military personnel said: This year the Mayor personally visits us, which is better than sending meat and fish to us in previous years. Before this, various villages in the suburbs and urban areas also carried out this kind of visiting activity with resident committees as units. The visiting delegation learned about the living conditions and needs of families of martyrs and families of military personnel; those with living difficulties will be helped to solve them before the Spring Festival.

During the Spring Festival, the whole city will also hold symposiums to慰问 families of martyrs and families of military personnel, with streets, townships, and towns as units, to convey to them the spirit of the National Congress of Activists in Socialist Construction of Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Soldiers, and Demobilized Soldiers, inspect the work of preferential treatment over the past year, and listen to their opinions and criticisms on the work of preferential treatment.

From before the Spring Festival to during the Spring Festival, people from all walks of life in Nanchang City will also go to 駐軍 and related hospitals to visit,慰问 and perform.
