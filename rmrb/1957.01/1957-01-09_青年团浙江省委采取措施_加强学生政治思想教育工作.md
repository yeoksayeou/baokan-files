The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League Takes Measures to Strengthen Political and Ideological Education of Students

(Our dispatch) Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League successively learned about the work of the League in secondary schools in Hangzhou City and Jiaxing, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Jinhua, and other regions, and thus decided to take measures to cooperate with the education administrative departments to strengthen political and ideological education for students.

The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League believes that this semester, all schools have paid attention to cultivating students' ability to think and work independently, and have given play to students' initiative. New atmospheres have emerged among students, the atmosphere of academic research is stronger than before, and life is more lively than before. However, at the same time, some new problems have also arisen, such as a small number of students opposing their personal interests to the needs of the country, refusing to participate in necessary collective activities, etc.

At present, the Provincial Committee of the League is contacting the education administrative departments, preparing to conduct political and ideological education centered on the all-round development policy, internationalism, patriotism, and collectivism for students in the near future, in order to improve students' ability to distinguish right from wrong. Before the start of the winter vacation, an education on the current international situation will be carried out to all students to clarify the vague concepts existing among a small number of students. In addition, students will be guided to correctly understand the current situation and prospects of the countryside after the high tide of cooperation, educate students to resolutely support the Party's policies in the countryside, and encourage them to actively help farmers carry out social and cultural and recreational activities in rural areas during the winter vacation, cultivate their love for their hometowns, and further strengthen the ties between school youth and rural youth.

The Provincial Committee of the League also requires League organizations in schools to conduct education on the all-round development policy to League members and students at any time, helping them to understand the relationship between personal aspirations, interests, and future and collective interests, the relationship between freedom and discipline, and the relationship between democracy and centralism; and vigorously advocate the style of hard work and plain living among League members and students. Regarding students' legitimate demands in terms of living welfare, which can be done under the existing conditions, the League organization should promptly reflect to the school administration and request that they be appropriately satisfied; those that cannot be done for the time being should also be patiently explained to the students. Students should be educated to consciously abide by discipline and respect teachers.

The Provincial Committee of the League believes that the shortcomings that existed in the past in carrying out political and ideological work for students should mainly be the responsibility of the leadership. The task of the League organization in schools is to carry out positive education to young people with a positive and caring attitude, explain the principles clearly, and help them improve their ability to distinguish right from wrong. When carrying out education to young people, League cadres should adopt lively and vivid methods that suit the characteristics of young people.

    青年团浙江省委采取措施
    加强学生政治思想教育工作
    本报讯　最近，青年团浙江省委先后在杭州市和嘉兴、宁波、温州、金华等地区了解了团在中等学校中的工作情况，从而决定采取措施，配合教育行政部门，对学生加强政治思想教育。
    青年团浙江省委认为这学期来，各校注意了培养学生独立思考和独立工作的能力，发挥学生的主动精神。学生中已经出现了一些新气象，学术研究的空气较前浓厚，生活也较前活泼。但与此同时也产生了一些新的问题，如少数同学将个人的兴趣同国家的需要对立起来，拒绝参加必要的集体活动，等等。
    目前，团省委正在同教育行政部门取得联系，准备在最近时期内对学生进行以全面发展方针、国际主义、爱国主义和集体主义为中心的政治思想教育，以提高学生明辨是非的能力，在寒假开始以前，将向全体同学进行一次当前国际形势的教育，澄清少数学生中间存在的模糊观念。此外，还将指导学生正确认识合作化高潮后的农村现状和前途，教育学生坚决拥护党在农村中的政策，并且鼓励他们在寒假期间回农村积极帮助农民开展社会活动和文化娱乐活动，培养自己热爱家乡的感情，以及进一步加强学校青年同农村青年之间的联系。
    团省委还要求学校中的团组织随时向团员和同学进行全面发展方针的教育，帮助他们认识个人的志趣、爱好、前途同集体利益的关系，自由同纪律的关系，民主同集中的关系；在团员和同学中大力提倡艰苦朴素的作风。对于同学在生活福利方面的正当要求，在现有条件下可以办到的。团组织应该及时向学校行政上反映，并要求适当地予以满足；一时不能办到的，也要耐心地向同学解释。要教育同学自觉地遵守纪律，尊敬老师。
    团省委认为：过去在对学生进行政治思想工作中存在的缺点，主要应该由领导方面负责。学校团组织的任务是以积极的、爱护的态度，向青年们进行正面教育，讲清道理，帮助他们提高明辨是非的能力。团的工作干部在向青年进行教育时，要采取生动活泼、适合青年特点的方法。
