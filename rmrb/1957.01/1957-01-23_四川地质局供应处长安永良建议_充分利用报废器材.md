Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 22nd: Chang An Yongliang, head of the Supply Department of the Sichuan Provincial Geological Bureau, has proposed more than ten suggestions for utilizing scrap equipment to overcome the supply difficulties of pipes and spare parts this year. In the past, field exploration work was often suspended due to a lack of drill pipes, casings, and spare parts. Therefore, An Yongliang's suggestions were welcomed by the field team leaders and supply personnel attending the Sichuan Provincial Geological Bureau's planning meeting.

An Yongliang suggested using scrap 300-meter drilling rig drill pipes to replace hand-cranked drill pipes. The method involves connecting the first meter of the drilling rig drill pipe with the hand-cranked drill pipe, while the remaining part uses worn-out 300-meter drilling rig drill pipes, connected in the middle with large and small joints. In this way, a hand-cranked drill, which originally required 150 meters of hand-cranked drill pipe, now only needs one meter, which can save more than 4,400 meters of new pipes throughout the year.

The sand settling pipe on the drilling rig is consumed every 50 or 60 meters of drilling. Since last year, due to insufficient pipe supply, the sand settling pipes have not been able to meet production needs. This year, 1,650 meters of large-diameter seamless steel pipes are needed to make sand settling pipes. An Yongliang suggested using scrap casing pipes to make them, so that the old exploration team will not need to apply for pipe materials for making sand settling pipes this year.

There are many discarded waste steel grit drill bits on exploration sites. An Yongliang proposed using waste steel grit drill bits to modify blank alloy drill bits, or using a ferrule method to modify vertical shaft roller cone guides. He also proposed suggestions for repairing drilling rig gears, vertical shafts, horizontal shafts, steel wire ropes, etc. Although the repaired ones are not as strong and durable as new ones, they can still solve major problems. For example, a new drilling rig gear can be used for one month. After a scrap gear is re-repaired by the ferrule method, it can only be used for seven to ten days. However, if the Sichuan Provincial Geological Bureau repairs 200 of them, it can drill more than 10,000 meters.

An Yongliang's suggestions summarize the experience of the Zhongliangshan Coalfield Exploration Team, the Panzhihua Iron Mine Exploration Team, and the 508 Exploration Team in utilizing scrap equipment over the past few years. Since 1953, he has been working in field exploration teams in charge of equipment supply, and has been studying with repair workers to solve the problem of equipment supply difficulties for a long time. Therefore, his suggestions are practical and feasible.

### 四川地质局供应处长安永良建议  充分利用报废器材

    四川地质局供应处长安永良建议
    充分利用报废器材
    新华社重庆22日电　四川省地质局供应处处长安永良提出十多项利用报废器材克服今年管材、零配件供应困难的建议。过去野外勘探工作往往因缺乏钻杆、套管和零配件而停工待料，因此安永良的建议受到参加四川省地质局计划会议的野外队队长和供应人员们的欢迎。
    安永良建议用报废的三百公尺钻机钻杆代替手摇钻钻杆。办法是连接钻机的一公尺钻杆仍旧采用手摇钻钻杆，其余部分采用磨损报废的三百公尺钻机的钻杆，中间用大小接头连接起来。这样一部手摇钻原来需要一百五十公尺的手摇钻钻杆，现在只要一公尺就够了，全年可以节约新管材四千四百多公尺。
    钻机上的沉沙管，每钻进五、六十公尺便要消耗一个。从去年起因为管材供应不足，使沉沙管不能满足生产需要。今年全年需要大口径无缝钢管一千六百五十公尺来做沉沙管。安永良建议用报废的套管来做，这样老勘探队今年就不需要申请做沉沙管的管材。
    废钢砂钻头，勘探工地上弃置不少。安永良提出用废钢砂钻头改制空白合金钻头，或用镶套的办法改制立轴牙轮导管。他还提出修补钻机牙轮、立轴、横轴、钢丝绳等建议。虽然修补的没有新的坚固耐用，但也可以解决大问题。例如一个新钻机牙轮可以使用一个月，报废牙轮用镶套办法重新修补以后，只能使用七天到十天；但是四川省地质局以修补二百个计算，便可以钻进一万多公尺。
    安永良的建议集中了几年来中梁山煤田勘探队、攀枝花铁矿勘探队、五○八勘探队利用报废器材的经验。他从1953年以来便在野外勘探队担任器材供应工作，长期和修配工人研究解决器材供应困难问题，因此他的建议是切实可行的。
