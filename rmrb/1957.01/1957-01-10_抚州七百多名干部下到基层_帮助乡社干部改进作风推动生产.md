(Report from the Jiangxi Daily) The CCP Fuzhou District has sent a large number of cadres with rural work experience out of the offices and into the countryside to strengthen the leadership at the grassroots level. This time, the entire district has transferred a total of 535 cadres at or above the district committee level and 180 general Party member cadres to form 54 district work committees and set up resident instructors in 350 townships.

After these cadres went to the townships, most of them held meetings with township and commune cadres and commune members, enthusiastically exchanging information on various matters, and expressing their intention to unite and learn from each other in the future. With the help of these cadres, the leadership methods and work styles of township and commune cadres in various places have improved, and the relatively slow winter production has begun to turn around. In Lichaun County, only 56,000 mu of winter plowing had been completed. After the cadres sent to the townships helped the township and commune cadres solve the main obstacles in the current production, the winter plowing land increased to more than 96,000 mu in five days; the average fertilizer accumulation per mu in the county also increased by about two dan compared to before. Chen Yougen, the resident instructor of Zhongji Township, promoted the consolidation work of the entire township with the leadership method of "penetrating the key points and driving the overall situation," setting an example for township and commune cadres. In the past, the Guanghui Agricultural Cooperative of Zhongtian Township had insufficient preparations, a lack of farm tools, and poor distribution work. The commune members were not very enthusiastic about winter plowing, and the commune cadres could not come up with a solution. Later, the resident instructor organized everyone to analyze the reasons, helped the cooperative quickly do a good job in distribution, stabilized the morale of the masses, and arranged the labor force. The entire cooperative immediately launched a winter plowing upsurge, plowing more than 1,900 mu of land in a few days.

In order to establish a normal working order for township and commune leadership and further improve winter production, the First Secretary, Deputy Secretaries and members of the CCP Fuzhou District Committee went to various counties on January 3 to provide guidance and assistance. After discovering that some of the cadres sent to the townships in some places were excessively criticizing the township and commune cadres, and some township and commune cadres were simply relying on the cadres sent to the townships, as well as problems such as lack of coordination between them, the CCP Fuzhou District Committee has notified the counties by telephone, requesting that attention be paid to preventing and solving these problems.

    抚州七百多名干部下到基层
    帮助乡社干部改进作风推动生产
    本报讯　据江西日报消息：中共抚州地区大批有农村工作经验的干部走出机关，到农村去加强基层领导力量。这次全区共抽调区委级以上干部五百三十五名、一般党员干部一百八十名，组成五十四个区工作委员会，在三百五十个乡设了驻乡指导员。
    这些下乡干部到乡后，大都和乡、社干部、社员举行了见面会，热情地交换各项情况，表示今后要相互团结，相互学习。在这批干部帮助下，各地乡、社干部领导方法和工作作风已有改进，开始扭转冬季生产比较迟缓的现象。黎川县原来冬耕只完成五万六千亩。下乡干部帮助乡社干部解决了当前生产中的主要障碍后，五天中冬耕地就增到九万六千多亩；全县积肥每亩平均也较前增加两担左右。中际乡驻乡指导员陈友根以“深入重点，带动全面”的领导方法，推动了全乡整社工作，为乡社干部做出了样子。中田乡光辉农业社以前由于准备不足，农具缺乏，分配工作也作得不好，社员冬耕劲头不大，而社干又拿不出办法，后经驻乡指导员组织大家分析原因，帮助社里迅速做好分配工作，安定了群众情绪，安排好劳力，全社立即掀起冬耕高潮，几天中耕田一千九百多亩。
    为了建立乡社领导的正常工作秩序，进一步搞好冬季生产，中共抚州地委正副书记、委员1月3日又分赴各县进行指导和协助。中共抚州地委发现目前某些地方的下乡干部对乡社干部过分指责和某些乡社干部单纯依靠下乡干部，以及相互间不协调等问题后，已电话通知各县，要求注意防止和解决这些问题。
