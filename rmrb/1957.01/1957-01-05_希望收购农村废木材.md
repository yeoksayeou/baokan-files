    Hoping to Acquire Waste Wood from Rural Areas
    The Anguang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jilin Province regards the acquisition of waste wood as an important aspect of waste product acquisition. As of December 10, 1956, the county had acquired more than 160,000 jin of waste wood; if the purchase price were one fen per jin, it would increase farmers' income by more than 1,600 yuan. The waste wood acquired by the supply and marketing cooperatives in various villages has been successively transported to towns and cities, and the state-owned timber company supplies it to local residents, saving the country's consumption of new timber. The urban residents are very welcoming, and they have said that buying waste wood from rural areas is cheap and burns well.
    We hope that comrades in supply and marketing cooperatives in other places will consider whether they can also do this?

    希望收购农村废木材
    吉林省安广县供销合作社，把收购废木材作为一项重要的废品收购工作。截至1956年12月10日止，全县已收购十六万多斤废木材；如果每斤收购价为一分，就可以给农民增加收入一千六百多元。各村供销社收购的废木材，已经陆续运往城镇，由国营木材公司供应当地居民，节省了国家新木材的消耗。城镇居民十分欢迎，纷纷反映：买农村的废木材，价格便宜，又好燃烧。
    希望别的地方的供销社的同志们考虑一下，能不能也这样做？
