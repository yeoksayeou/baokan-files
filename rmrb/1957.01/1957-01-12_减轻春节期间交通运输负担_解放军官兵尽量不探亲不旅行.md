Xinhua News Agency, 11th: To alleviate the burden on national transportation during the Spring Festival, officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army will minimize family visits and travel.

A notice recently issued to the entire army by the General Staff Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stated that the national railway and shipping transport tasks are expected to be very heavy during this year's Spring Festival. This is a phenomenon brought about by increased wages, the opening of free markets under state leadership, and the improvement of people's living standards. In order to reduce the burden on national transportation during the Spring Festival, the notice stated that, with the exception of troops stationed in remote areas such as Xinjiang and Tibet, leading organs of all units are required to strictly control and minimize family visits and travel by officers and soldiers during the Spring Festival. Some officers and soldiers who go out on official business should also not compete with passengers for seats on trains and ships.

    减轻春节期间交通运输负担
    解放军官兵尽量不探亲不旅行
    新华社11日讯　中国人民解放军官兵春节期间将尽量不探亲和旅行，以减轻国家在交通运输方面的负担。
    中国人民解放军总参谋部最近发给全军的一项通知中说，今年春节期间，预计全国铁路、轮船运输任务很繁重，这是由于工资增加、国家领导下的自由市场开放和人民生活水平提高等情况带来的现象。为了减轻春节期间国家在交通运输方面的负担，通知说，除了驻新疆和西藏等边远地区的部队以外，要求各部队领导机关严格控制，尽量减少军官、士兵在春节期间探亲和旅行。有些军官、士兵因公事外出，也不要同旅客争乘车、船。
