    A Trip to Taiyuan

    The Fen River: Standing on Yingze Bridge, I look at the water of the Fen River, thinking of the dramatic historical figures who once lived in a bay of the Fen River, Xue Rengui and Liu Jinhua, separated for eighteen years. Standing on Yingze Bridge, I look at the water of the Fen River, thinking of the story of Yang Liulang and his five brothers meeting on Mount Wutai at the tail of the Fen River. Standing on Yingze Bridge, I look at the water of the Fen River, and although I am not a drinker, I seem to be looking at the world-famous Fenjiu wine, as if I can smell its fragrant aroma.

    Ancient Cypress: In front of the Uncle Yu Temple, there is a reclining cypress with two long arms extending diagonally towards the west. Today, in early autumn, I come to this ancient cypress. I linger around it, reluctant to leave. I want to have a long talk with it, but I'm afraid it lacks a mouth and cannot tell me a long history of two thousand nine hundred years.

    Stainless Steel: Behind the Flying Beam Bridge, in front of the Holy Mother Hall, there stand four Vajras. They are four iron men cast to protect the Holy Mother. Due to wind, rain, and sun exposure, three of the iron men have been severely eroded. Only one remains shining all over. A distinguished guest praised and said: "This is the wisdom of the ancient Chinese working people, stainless steel from nine hundred years ago!"

    Jin Ci: The Never Aging Spring is cool in summer and warm in winter, constantly maintaining a body temperature of eighteen degrees, spewing out three thousand six hundred jin of fragrant water per minute. It has never changed for thousands of years. The people deeply appreciate your kindness and call you the "Never Aging Spring Flowing with Heaven and Earth." Several clumps of duckweed grow at the bottom of the water. People call it "Evergreen Duckweed" because it constantly maintains a body temperature of eighteen degrees, and its leaves are green all year round. Plants also grow on the water surface, which people call "Night Closing Lotus" because it constantly maintains a body temperature of eighteen degrees, blooms during the day in all seasons, and sleeps at night.
