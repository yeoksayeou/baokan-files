    Qaidam Oil Drilling Personnel Persist in Construction Through the Severe Winter
    Drilling and oil testing prove that the Youquanzi shallow oil layer and the Lenghu No. 4 shallow oil layer have industrial development value, and the quality of the crude oil is very good.
    Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 4th. After completing the 1956 national plan for oil drilling and oil testing projects ahead of schedule, all drilling personnel in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai Province are still braving the severe cold of minus 20 to 30 degrees Celsius and persisting in winter construction in Qaidam.
    Through their efforts, among the five oil-bearing structures that underwent deep well drilling in 1956, except for the Mangya structure which did not discover oil and gas shows, the Lenghu No. 4, Youquanzi, and Youdunzi structures all had a large amount of crude oil and natural gas gushing from the wellhead during drilling. The Dafengshan structure also discovered oil and gas shows and thin layers of oil-bearing sandstone. Oil testing results prove that the Youquanzi shallow oil layer and the shallow oil layer of the Lenghu No. 4 structure both have industrial development value, and the crude oil quality is very good. Some wells can also produce a large amount of natural gas that can be used as fuel while producing oil.
    In the 1956 oil drilling project, their team grew stronger. The Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau not only trained thousands of drilling and underground geological technicians and skilled workers, but also gained valuable experience and lessons in deep well drilling in the Qaidam Basin. Many drilling interns who had just graduated from university and came to Qaidam to participate in work in the winter of 1955 are now able to work independently. The 3271 drilling team, without being familiar with the geological conditions, only spent nine months to drill a 3,020-meter deep exploration well, and saved the country 110 tons of seamless steel casing. The Youquanzi exploration area, on the basis of continuously summarizing experiences and lessons, criticized various practices that ignored safe production, and gradually established systematic technical measures and production systems. Therefore, the wells drilled in this exploration area were drilled faster and more safely than the previous one, and the entire team completed the national annual drilling footage plan 39 days ahead of schedule.

    柴达木石油钻探人员隆冬坚持施工
    经过钻探和试油证明：油泉子浅油层和冷湖四号浅油层具有工业开采价值，原油的质量很好。
    新华社西宁4日电　青海省柴达木盆地全体钻探人员在提前完成1956年石油钻井和试油工程的国家计划以后，目前仍然冒着摄氏零下二十几度到三十度的严寒，坚持在柴达木进行冬季施工。
    经过他们的努力，在1956年进行深井钻探的五个储油构造中，除了茫崖构造没有发现油气显示以外，冷湖四号、油泉子和油墩子三个构造在钻进中都有大量的原油和天然气喷出井口，大风山构造也发现有油气显示和薄层含油砂岩。试油结果证明：油泉子浅油层和冷湖四号构造的浅油层都具有工业开采价值，而且原油质量很好。有的井在产油的同时还可以出产大量能作燃料的天然气。
    在1956年的石油钻探工程中，他们的队伍壮大了。青海石油勘探局不仅培养了数千名钻井、地下地质技术干部和技术工人，而且获得了在柴达木盆地进行深井钻探的宝贵的经验和教训。1955年冬季许多刚由大学毕业来柴达木参加工作的钻井实习员，现在已经能够独立地进行工作。三二七一钻井队在不熟悉地质情况的条件下，仅仅用了九个月时间就钻成了一口三千零二十公尺的深探井，并且给国家节约了一百一十吨无缝钢套管。油泉子探区在不断总结经验教训的基础上，批判了各种忽视安全生产的做法，逐步建立起系统的技术措施和生产制度。因此，这个探区开钻的井一个比一个钻得快，钻得安全，全大队提前三十九天完成了国家钻井进尺年计划。
