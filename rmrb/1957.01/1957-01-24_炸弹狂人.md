    Bombing Madman
    Recently, the New York City Police Department mobilized more than 20,000 police officers and detectives and offered a reward of $25,000 to arrest a "madman" who specializes in planting bombs in public places such as theaters, cinemas, stadiums, and buses, causing injuries. According to the latest issue of "Time Magazine," because some New York newspapers have greatly exaggerated the "madman's" crazy behavior, causing panic, the police department receives many calls reporting bomb discoveries every day. New York City Police Commissioner Kennedy had to ask the newspapers to publish less news to avoid causing chaos.

    炸弹狂人
    最近，纽约市警察局动员了二万多名警察和侦探，出了二万五千美元的赏金，来逮捕一个专在剧院、电影院、体育场、公共汽车等公共场所安放炸弹伤人的“狂人”。据最近一期的“时代周刊”说，由于纽约的一些报纸对这个“狂人”的疯狂行为大加渲染，弄得人心惶惶，警察局每天接到许多报告发现炸弹的电话。纽约市警察局长肯尼迪不得不要求报纸少发表消息，以免引起紊乱。
