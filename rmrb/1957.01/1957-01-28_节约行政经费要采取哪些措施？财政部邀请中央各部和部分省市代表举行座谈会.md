Xinhua News Agency, 27th: The Ministry of Finance recently held a symposium to study measures to save administrative expenses.

    Representatives from central ministries and some provinces and cities who attended the symposium reviewed the extravagance and waste and unreasonable expenditures in state administrative organs in 1956, and proposed that work should be carried out in two aspects: on the one hand, vigorous efforts should be made in state organs to streamline institutions and consolidate staffing to change the current phenomenon of overlapping institutions and overstaffing; on the other hand, administrative financial management should be strengthened, expenditure systems should be improved, and public funds and operating expenses of organs should be used effectively to curb extravagance and waste.

    The representatives believe that in order to implement the spirit of streamlining and thrift, and to ensure that the 1957 budget targets are not broken, in addition to obtaining strong support from Party and government leaders to arrange the administrative budget, necessary thrift measures should also be taken according to the specific circumstances. The main thrift measures proposed by everyone are: in terms of renovation and procurement, no furniture and equipment should be purchased under the current circumstances of streamlining institutions, warehouses should be cleared to utilize old furniture, and adjustments should be made within an appropriate scope; for house repairs, attention should only be paid to maintaining them so that they do not collapse or leak, but unnecessary painting, decoration, and varnishing should be prevented. In terms of conference expenses, the number of meetings, the number of participants, and the time should be strictly controlled, an approval system should be established, and expenditure standards should be appropriately reduced. During meetings, there should be no meals, no watching plays, no outings, no gifts, no photos, and no souvenirs. Meeting halls and guest houses of the organs should be used as much as possible, and meeting venues and hotels should not be rented or rented less. In terms of office expenses of organs, the use of long-distance telephone calls and telegrams should be strictly controlled. The regulations on self-funded subscription to newspapers and periodicals should be strictly implemented. Business trips must be prepared and purposeful, and the number of people and the time of the trip should be determined according to the size of the matter. The vehicles of the organs should be centrally managed and uniformly dispatched, labor competitions for car drivers should be carried out, vehicle maintenance should be strengthened, repairs should be carried out by themselves as much as possible, the current fuel consumption standards should be reduced, and the slogan of "no long-distance, no short-distance in the city, and no private use" should be put forward. Simplify official document procedures, make full use of old office supplies, save water and electricity, and remove unnecessary telephones. Resolutely implement the State Council's instructions on saving coal, organize exchanges of methods and experiences in saving coal, and improve coal burning technology. In terms of printing, establish an approval system for printed materials, streamline organ publications, merge those that can be merged, and strengthen distribution plans. Appropriately reduce the quality of printing paper. According to the specific situation, mimeographing and copying can be used, and printing costs should be reduced as much as possible. In addition, the current administrative expenses and business expenses that have high expenditure standards should be reduced, and those that are unreasonable should be revised.

    节约行政经费要采取哪些措施？
    财政部邀请中央各部和部分省市代表举行座谈会
    新华社27日讯　财政部最近召开座谈会，研究节约行政经费的措施。
    参加座谈会的中央各部和部分省、市的代表，检查了1956年国家行政机关里的铺张浪费现象和不合理的开支，提出应该从两方面着手进行工作：一方面要在国家机关中大力进行精简机构和整顿编制，以改变目前机构重叠和人浮于事的现象；另一方面要加强行政财务管理，并且健全开支制度，有效地使用机关公用经费和事业费，制止铺张浪费。
    代表们认为，为了贯彻精简节约的精神，保证1957年预算指标不被突破，除应取得党政领导的大力支持，把行政经费预算安排下来以外，也应该根据具体情况采取必要的节约措施。大家提出的节约措施主要是：在修缮购置方面，在目前进行精简机构的情况下不购置家具设备，清理仓库利用旧存家具，并且在适当范围内进行调剂；对房屋修缮只应注意维护它不塌不漏，但要防止不必要的粉刷、装饰及油漆等。在会议经费方面，应严格控制会议的次数人数和时间，建立审批制度并且适当降低开支标准。开会期间，不会餐、不看戏、不游园、不送礼、不照像、不发纪念品。尽量利用机关礼堂和招待所，不租用或少租用会场和旅馆。在机关办公费方面，应严格控制长途电话和电报的使用。严格执行报刊自费订阅的规定。因公出差一定要有准备、有目的，要按事情大小决定出差人次和时间。集中管理和统一调用机关的汽车，开展汽车司机劳动竞赛，加强车辆的保养，尽可能自行检修，降低现行用油标准，并且提出长途不用、市内短途不用、私事不用的口号。简化公文手续，充分利用旧的办公用品，节省水电，撤除不必要的电话机。坚决贯彻国务院关于节约用煤的指示，组织交流节约用煤的方法和经验，提高烧煤技术。在印刷方面，建立印刷品的审批制度，精简机关刊物，能合并的合并，并加强发行计划。适当降低印刷用纸的质量。根据具体情况可采用油印及复写，尽量减少印刷用费。此外，对现行行政经费和业务费开支标准高的应该降低，不合理的应该修改。
