Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 3rd. Seventy different field exploration teams will continue searching for oil in the Ordos Basin, located at the junction of Gansu, Shaanxi, and Inner Mongolia, this year. Among these exploration teams, six are specifically dedicated to reconnaissance work, while the majority consists of ground detailed survey and measurement teams, geophysical teams, and shallow and deep well drilling teams. Based on past exploration, they will prepare five structures suitable for drilling in 1958. At the same time, they will begin drilling three deep exploration wells over 3,000 meters deep on the western edge of the basin in order to further explore the oil reserves of the basin.

Exploration of the Ordos Basin began in 1950. By last year, more than sixty oil-bearing structures had been discovered, and indications of oil seeps, asphalt, dry oil sand, and oil and gas have been found in many more locations. These discoveries have led geologists to tentatively conclude that the strata of the western part of the basin have a high potential for oil and are worthy of more work.

    将有七十个勘探队
    到鄂尔多斯找石油
    据新华社西安3日电　在甘肃、陕西和内蒙古交界处的鄂尔多斯地台，今年将有七十个各种野外勘探队继续寻找石油。这些勘探队除了六个是专门进行普查工作的以外，其余大部分是地面详查细测队、地球物理队、浅井和深井的钻井队等。他们将在过去勘探的基础上，为1958年准备好五个可供钻探的构造，同时，将在地台西缘开始钻探三口三千公尺以上的深探井，以便进一步探明地台的储油情况。
    鄂尔多斯地台是1950年开始进行勘探的。到去年为止，已经发现六十多个储油构造，并且在更多的地方发现了油苗、沥青、干油砂、油气等显示。这些发现使地质人员对地台西部初步得出结论，认为地台的地层中含油希望很大，值得做更多的工作。
