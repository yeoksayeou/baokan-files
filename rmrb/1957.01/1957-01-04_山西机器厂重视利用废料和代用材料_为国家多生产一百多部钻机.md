Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, January 2nd: The state-owned Shanxi Machinery Factory has utilized waste materials and substitute materials to produce an additional one hundred and twenty-two fully qualified 500-meter drilling rigs for the country.

In 1956, the national materials allocation department supplied the Shanxi Machinery Factory with raw materials for the production of two hundred and twenty-eight drilling rigs. These drilling rigs were delivered ahead of schedule by the end of September 1956. The geological exploration department then requested a continued supply of one hundred and twenty-two drilling rigs. The factory's employees, faced with the national inability to continuously allocate raw materials, accepted the production task for this batch of products.

All the factory's employees came up with many solutions to overcome the raw material shortage. They established contact with more than eighty fraternal factories inside and outside the province. They collected over a thousand tons of materials that could be processed and substituted from the warehouses and scrap yards of these units. The factory's technicians and workers also carried out research on the utilization of waste materials, strengthening the analysis, identification, and processing of old and waste materials. Workers also implemented a "material selection and preparation, measuring materials for cutting" system in the material cutting process, turning every steel material head into various spare parts for drilling rigs. Thanks to the efforts of the employees, the completion of this production task was guaranteed.

The employees of the Shanxi Machinery Factory consistently adhered to a rigorous analysis, identification, and practical trial system in the process of manufacturing drilling rigs using waste and substitute materials, ensuring product quality.

    山西机器厂重视利用废料和代用材料
    为国家多生产一百多部钻机
    新华社太原2日电　地方国营山西机器厂利用废料和代用材料为国家多生产了一百二十二部完全合格的五百公尺钻探机。
    1956年，国家材料调拨部门供给山西机器厂生产二百二十八部钻探机的原材料，这些钻探机已经提前在1956年9月底交货。地质勘探部门又提出继续供应一百二十二部钻探机的要求。这个厂的职工们在国家不能连续调拨原材料的情况下，接受了这批产品的生产任务。
    全厂职工为克服原材料不足的困难想了许多办法。他们同省内外八十多个兄弟厂建立了联系。在这些单位的仓库里、废料旧料堆中收集到能够加工和代用的材料有一千多吨。厂里技术人员和工人们也开展了利用废料的研究，加强了分析鉴定和加工旧料、废料的工作。工人们还在下料过程中实行“选材备料，量材下料”制度，把每根钢材料头都做成钻探机的各种备件。由于职工们的努力，保证了这批生产任务的完成。
    山西机器厂的职工在利用废料和代用材料制造钻探机的过程中始终坚持了严密的分析鉴定和实际试用制度，保证了产品质量。
