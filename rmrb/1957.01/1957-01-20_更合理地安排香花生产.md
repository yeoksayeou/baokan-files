    More Rational Arrangement of Fragrant Flower Production
    Ji Shi, Zhihao

    China has a long history of fragrant flower production. Currently, there are more than ten varieties, including jasmine, magnolia, pearl orchid, bitter orange, pomelo, rose, and gardenia, distributed in more than a dozen provinces and cities such as Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, Sichuan, Guangdong, Henan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Zhejiang. Except for a very small portion of fragrant flowers used for people to admire and wear, the rest are used to scent flower tea. Fujian, Suzhou, and other places have flower tea scenting factories. Fragrant flowers can be used to manufacture fragrances, and recent experiments have been successful. China is about to build new fragrance factories using fragrant flowers as raw materials. In the future, the uses of fragrant flowers will gradually expand.

    In recent years, China's fragrant flower production has greatly developed. In 1956, the output of fragrant flowers reached more than 50,000 dan (a unit of weight, approximately 50 kg), an increase of more than 200 times compared to 1952. In Hangzhou, Zhejiang, the output of jasmine flowers in 1956 increased by 55.49% compared to 1955. In Guangdong, the cultivated area of jasmine flowers in 1956 expanded from more than 500 mu to more than 800 mu.

    The income from fragrant flower production is greater than that from general crops. For example, in Zhejiang, planting jasmine flowers can yield a net profit of 34.5%, while in Chengdu, it can yield a net profit of 46.34%. Although the production and management of fragrant flowers are technically demanding, the labor intensity is lighter than growing general crops, and semi-labor can also cultivate them.

    The distribution of fragrant flower producing areas in China is still not very rational. For example, Fujian has a large output of fragrant flowers and low costs, but the province does not produce much rough tea and must import a large amount of tea embryos from Zhejiang, Anhui, and other places. Similar situations exist in Suzhou, Jiangsu. In addition, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hunan, and other provinces produce large quantities of tea, but the output of fragrant flowers is very small, and the tea must be transferred to other places for scenting. Therefore, in the distribution of fragrant flower production areas in the future, it is necessary to ensure that the local fragrant flower output is compatible with the local tea output. In this way, we can reduce transportation links, reduce production costs, shorten scenting time, and promptly supply market needs.

    The seasonality of fragrant flower production is strong, and there are certain contradictions between flowers used for scenting tea and flowers used for making fragrances. After the spring and summer tea purchases are completed each year, scenting must be done in a timely manner in order to ensure excellent quality. The quality of fragrant flowers produced at different times of the year varies, and selections should be made when scenting tea. For example, jasmine flowers used for scenting tea must be concentrated on using "Fu flowers" (produced from mid-July to early August, with heavy and substantial flowers of excellent quality) to ensure that the flower tea has a rich and lasting aroma. Fragrance factories use fragrant flowers as raw materials all year round. If they all use "Fu flowers," supply will fall short of demand. Therefore, during the "Fu flower" production season in July and August, the distribution of "Fu flowers" should be rationally allocated, giving priority to the needs of tea scenting. To ensure that fragrance factories have sufficient raw materials, we must also strengthen the cultivation and management of "Mei flowers" and "Autumn flowers" (Mei flowers are produced in early July, and Autumn flowers are produced in late August, with light and floating flowers of lower quality) to increase their output and quality. Experience has shown that as long as the growing environment and temperature of the flower trees are properly adjusted, and fertilization and watering are done well, the quality and yield of "Mei flowers" and "Autumn flowers" can match that of "Fu flowers." In addition, according to the specific conditions and possibilities of various places, we should guide flower farmers to cultivate "Xiang flowers" (flowers potted in flower houses) in winter and spring to ensure the supply of raw materials for year-round factory production.

    With the development of China's industrial and agricultural production and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the demand for fragrant flowers will inevitably increase day by day. Some people see the rapid growth of fragrant flower production and think that there is a surplus of fragrant flower production, and individual areas even compress production, which is inappropriate. In the future, we should make a long-term and comprehensive plan for fragrant flower production based on the growth characteristics of fragrant flowers, combined with the natural conditions such as climate and soil in different regions, and rationally deploy fragrant flower producing areas nationwide. In areas suitable and in need of planting fragrant flowers, agricultural cooperatives should appropriately arrange fragrant flower production on the premise of ensuring increased production of crops such as grain and cotton, in order to increase the income of agricultural cooperatives and meet industrial needs. Relevant departments should also strengthen technical guidance on fragrant flower cultivation and garden management.

    更合理地安排香花生产
    吉石　志浩
    我国香花生产的历史很久。目前，已有茉莉、玉兰、珠兰、玳玳、柚子、玫瑰、栀子等十余种，分布在江苏、安徽、福建、四川、广东、河南、广西、江西、湖南、浙江等十几个省、市。除极小部分香花供人们赏玩和佩戴以外，其余都是用来窨制花茶的。福建、苏州等地设有窨花茶厂。香花能制造香精，最近已试验成功。我国即将新建用香花作原料的香精厂。今后，香花的用途会逐步扩大。
    近几年来，我国的香花生产已有很大的发展。1956年香花的产量已达五万多担，比1952年增加了二百多倍。浙江杭州1956年的茉莉花产量比1955年增加55.49％。广东地区1956年茉莉花的培植面积，已由五百多亩扩大到了八百多亩。
    香花生产的收益，比一般农作物的收益大。如在浙江，种植茉莉花可得纯收益34.5％，成都可得纯收益46.34％。香花的生产和管理，虽然技术性较强，但劳动强度则比种一般农作物轻，半劳动力也可以培植。
    我国香花产区的分布还不大合理。如福建地区香花产量多，成本低；但该省所产的毛茶不多，必须从浙江、安徽等地运入大量茶胚。江苏苏州也有类似情况。另外，安徽、江西、浙江、湖南等省产大量茶叶，但香花产量很少，要把茶叶调到外地去窨制。因此，在香花生产地区的分布上，今后要做到当地香花产量和当地茶叶产量相适应。这样，才可以减少运输环节，降低生产成本，缩短窨制时间，及时供应市场需要。
    香花生产的季节性较强，窨茶用花和制造香精用花之间有一定的矛盾。每年春茶、夏茶收购结束以后，必须及时窨制，品质方能优良。一年中各时期所产的香花，品质优劣不同，窨茶的时候要加以选择。例如，窨茶用茉莉花必须集中使用“伏花”（产于7月中旬到8月上旬，花身重实，品质优异），才能保证花茶香气充沛、持久。香精厂是常年使用香花作原料的，如果也都使用“伏花”，就会供不应求。因此，在7、8月间“伏花”生产时节，在首先照顾窨茶需要的前提下，应合理地分配“伏花”。为了保证香精厂有足够的原料，还要加强对“霉花”和“秋花”（霉花产于7月上旬，秋花产于8月下旬，花身轻飘，品质较次）的培育和管理，提高它的产量和质量。经验证明，只要把花树生长环境、气温调剂适当，并做好施肥和浇水等工作，“霉花”、“秋花”的品质和产量，都能抵上“伏花”。此外，要根据各地具体情况和可能条件，指导花农在冬、春季节培植“厢花”（即在花房内盆栽的花），以保证工厂常年生产的原料供应。
    随着我国工农业生产的发展，人民生活不断提高，今后对香花的需求势必日益增加。有些人看到目前香花生产迅速增长，就认为香花生产过剩了，个别地区甚至压缩生产，这是不妥当的。今后，应当根据香花的生长特性，结合不同地区的气候、土壤等自然条件，作出香花生产的长期的全面规划，在全国范围内，合理布署香花产区。在适宜和需要种植香花的地区，农业社应在保证粮棉等作物增产的前提下，适当地安排香花生产，以增加农业社的收入，满足工业上的需要。在香花培育和花园管理上，有关部门也应加强技术指导。
