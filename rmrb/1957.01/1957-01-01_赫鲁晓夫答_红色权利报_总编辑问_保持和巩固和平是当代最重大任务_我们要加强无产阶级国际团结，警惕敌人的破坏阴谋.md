Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 31st: TASS Moscow, December 31st: Mr. F. Koutsky, Editor-in-Chief of "Red Right News," the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, asked Comrade N.S. Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to answer some questions. The following are Comrade Khrushchev's answers to these questions.

    Question: The resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union clearly stated that the masses of the people have enough strength to prevent war and ensure their own happy future in a peaceful environment. Humanity has repelled the aggression against Egypt and the attempts to restore the reactionary fascist regime in Hungary in the past year, and has achieved undeniable achievements in this regard.
    In your opinion, what are the current tasks in the struggle to ease international tensions and ensure lasting world peace?

    Answer: The events of the ending year of 1956 convincingly show that the struggle to maintain and consolidate peace is the most important task of our time. This struggle reflects the fundamental and vital interests of all countries.
    As everyone knows, thanks to the efforts of peace-loving countries, international tensions have been greatly eased. However, this situation is obviously displeasing to the warmongering groups in Western countries, who are concerned with continuing the Cold War and inciting hatred among the people of all countries, so that capitalist monopolies can more easily continue the arms race and make staggering profits.
    It is precisely for this reason that reactionaries are trying to complicate the international situation. This is manifested in the British, French, and Israeli aggressors' attack on Egypt, and the counter-revolutionary fascist conspiracy against the people's democratic system in Hungary. As a result, the threat of a new world war immediately became drastically serious. However, both adventures failed.
    Why were the imperialists unable to realize their plans? First of all, it is because the forces upholding peace are now strong enough to stop the adventurers from pushing the people of all countries into a new war disaster for their own purposes.
    Now everyone should understand that any attempt by the imperialists to launch a war, any attempt by reactionary forces to infringe upon the achievements of socialist countries, will be met with a due rebuff.
    One of the most important lessons of the past year is to raise the people's vigilance against the conspiracies of imperialist aggressors and resolutely launch a struggle for peace. There is no doubt that in the coming year of 1957, the forces of peace will be further strengthened, which will greatly contribute to the improvement of the international situation.
    I believe that disarmament and the reduction of armed forces, and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, would now be of great significance in easing international tensions and consolidating world peace. Stopping the expansion of armaments would help enhance international trust; reducing the huge expenditures on armaments would enable the people's welfare to be improved.
    The Soviet government has repeatedly shown initiative and put forward constructive proposals on disarmament. In addition, the Soviet Union has also taken a series of practical measures in this regard and greatly reduced its armed forces. The Czechoslovak Republic, the People's Republic of China, and all socialist countries are playing an active role in the struggle to consolidate peace.
    The establishment of a European collective security system is of great significance for easing international tensions, and it undoubtedly conforms to the vital interests of the people of all countries, because the establishment of such a system can ensure the maintenance of peace.
    To the greatest extent possible, developing international economic and cultural ties based on the principle of equality has been and remains an important factor in enhancing trust and understanding among the people of all countries. The Soviet Union has advocated and continues to advocate broad and unhindered economic cooperation with all countries, cooperation without any discrimination, and the expansion of cultural ties.
    In my opinion, these are the issues for striving to ease international tensions and ensure lasting world peace.

    Question: The working people of all countries will celebrate a major festival this year—the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. This day will remind the communist and workers' parties of all countries that they should unite more firmly under the banner of Marxism-Leninism and should fight more resolutely for the establishment of solid international working-class solidarity.
    In your opinion, what is most important to achieve this goal?

    Answer: In October 1917, under the leadership of the great Lenin and the Bolshevik Party, the working class and working people of our country eliminated the capitalist system and established a socialist country of workers and peasants. There have been enormous difficulties on the road to building a new society. But the Soviet people overcame these difficulties and built socialism.
    It can be said with complete certainty that since 1917, the entire international development and the progressive movement of the people of all countries have been influenced by the Great October Socialist Revolution.
    Following the Soviet people, the people of great China, Czechoslovakia, and many other countries in Europe and Asia have also embarked on the road of socialism. The family of socialist countries that make up the world socialist system has formed and is constantly strengthening and developing. The leading and guiding forces of these countries are the communist and workers' parties.
    The victory of the working class and the victory of the working people in the Soviet Union and the socialist countries have been achieved because the activities of the communist and workers' parties in these countries have consistently been guided by the Marxist-Leninist theory—the only correct proletarian theory. The communist parties of France, Italy, and other countries are carrying out an irreconcilable struggle for the cause of the working class and all working people under the banner of Marxism-Leninism.
    Precisely because of this, the enemies of socialism have concentrated their fire on the revolutionary parties, first and foremost on the parties in those countries where the working class has won victory and established political power, and where socialism is being built and has been built.
    The enemies of the working class will not hesitate to resort to any insidious means in order to create disputes in the communist movement and to disintegrate the unity of the communist and workers' parties! They are particularly advocating the so-called "national communism," advocating the opposition of the universal truths brought about by the October Revolution and necessary for the victorious transition from capitalism to socialism to the national characteristics of each country's development towards socialism. Of course, every country's struggle for the victory of the dictatorship of the proletariat and socialist construction has its own characteristics, and these characteristics are determined by its national and historical conditions. However, no matter what these characteristics are, they cannot change the basic laws of the socialist revolution. One-sided attitudes, overemphasizing the national characteristics and the "special path" to socialism of this or that country, will cause losses to the socialist construction cause of this country and the entire socialist family.
    The task is to raise vigilance against the conspiracies of the enemies of socialism and resolutely fight back against all conspiracies that undermine the foundation of the unity of the working class and its vanguard—the communist and workers' parties. It is also necessary to be vigilant against others who wear the mask of friends and wave the banner of fighting for socialism, but are engaged in the work of splitting the socialist ranks. Doing so is serving the imperialists who are trying to disintegrate the revolutionary forces, whether these people hope to do so or not.
    We should mobilize our strength with a sense of historical responsibility to strengthen the communist and workers' parties, strengthen proletarian solidarity and the unity of our ranks, unite the ranks of the international workers' movement, be loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, be loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism, and be loyal to the fighting slogan of "Workers of all countries, unite!"

    Question: Recent events have once again emphasized that it is necessary for the countries of the socialist camp to maintain close unity and implement the closest cooperation based on the principles put forward in the Soviet government's declaration of October 30, 1956.
    In your opinion, what are the main tasks for strengthening this cooperation in 1957?

    Answer: You are absolutely right. Recent events have once again powerfully shown that it is necessary for the countries of the socialist camp to maintain close unity and implement the closest cooperation.
    The principles stated in the Soviet government's declaration of October 30, 1956, have been and remain the foundation of the relationship between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. However, regrettably, these principles have sometimes been violated in the past. This naturally cannot but harm the friendship of the people of the socialist countries and be used by hostile elements to incite nationalist sentiments and to weaken the unity of our countries.
    The further strengthening of cooperation among socialist countries requires absolute adherence to the Leninist principle of respecting the national interests of all countries, and requires fraternal mutual assistance and the greatest possible development of friendly ties, so that the people of each of our countries can feel the practical benefits of this cooperation.
    Where is the source of the unstoppable power of socialist countries? It lies in unity and in the consolidation of the socialist family. This is the guarantee of new socialist achievements. This great achievement of the people should be cherished.
    I would like to draw attention to the further expansion of economic ties between socialist countries, which will help the economic and welfare of the working people to achieve new upsurges. A broader exchange of experiences in the organization of work in various industrial sectors and agriculture, experiences in improving labor productivity, and experiences in adopting scientific and technological achievements in production will play an important role. It is very natural that the people of socialist countries hope to get closer to each other and to understand each other better. Therefore, it is very important to deepen and expand mutual cultural ties.
    We must not forget that the working people of socialist countries are building a new life without exploiters and exploited under the conditions of the existence of the capitalist camp, where the ruling classes, their parties, and governments have been and are pursuing policies against our countries. Therefore, we must improve the collective defense of socialist countries and actively safeguard and consolidate world peace on the international stage.

    Question: Recent months' events have once again shown that Czechoslovak-Soviet friendship and brotherhood are unshakable and strong. Can you tell us about the significance of this friendship for the development of our two peoples and the international situation?

    Answer: The Soviet people highly value the long-standing and sincere fraternal friendship and comradely cooperation between our two peoples. During the years of the war against German fascism and in the post-war period, Soviet-Czechoslovak friendship has been tempered and consolidated, and has become an eternal friendship.
    What is the foundation of this friendship? Its foundation is the consistency of the fundamental interests of our two peoples, the consistency of thoughts and goals in the struggle for the cause of socialism and communism, for world peace, and for the happiness of the people, and is deep mutual respect and trust. It is based on the lofty principles of proletarian internationalism and is a model of the relationship between new types of socialist countries.
    Strengthening the friendship and fraternal unity of our two peoples helps the economic development and cultural development of the two countries, enables us to help each other and learn from each other, enables us to move forward more smoothly, and enables us to overcome difficulties more easily. We believe that the working people of Czechoslovakia have made many outstanding achievements in developing their national economy and culture, and there are some things that the Soviet people should learn from them.
    The Czechoslovak people and the Soviet people must carefully protect their friendship and do their best to strengthen their friendship, so that this friendship will not be harmed by the enemy's conspiracies. We should remain vigilant and remember that the German militarists are calculating revenge plans and are preparing forces to carry out new military adventures against our two peoples and the peoples of European countries.
    The Czechoslovak people can rest assured that the Soviet people will always be their sincere and reliable friends.
    Comrade Editor, please allow me to wish the readers of the fighting "Red Right News," the hardworking and capable fraternal Czechoslovak people, and the glorious Communist Party of Czechoslovakia success in building their socialist country and further improving the welfare of the working people.
    Dear comrades, Happy New Year!

    赫鲁晓夫答“红色权利报”总编辑问
    保持和巩固和平是当代最重大任务
    我们要加强无产阶级国际团结，警惕敌人的破坏阴谋
    新华社31日讯　塔斯社莫斯科31日讯：捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会机关报“红色权利报”总编辑弗·科乌茨基请苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫回答一些问题。以下是赫鲁晓夫同志对这些问题的答复。
    问：苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议明白地说到，人民群众有足够的力量防止战争，在和平环境中保障自己的幸福的前途。人类在过去的一年中打退了对埃及的侵略，打退了在匈牙利恢复反动的法西斯政权的企图，在这方面取得了不容置疑的成就。
    依您看来，在争取缓和国际紧张局势和保障世界持久和平的斗争中，当前的任务是什么？
    答：即将结束的1956年所发生的事件令人信服地表明，为保持和巩固和平而斗争，是当代最重大的任务。这一斗争反映了各国人民根本的切身利益。
    大家知道，由于爱好和平的国家的努力，国际紧张局势得以大大地缓和。但是，这种局面显然使西方国家的好战集团不高兴，他们所关心的是继续进行冷战，煽动各国人民之间的仇恨，以便使资本主义垄断组织能够比较容易地继续进行军备竞赛和牟取惊人的利润。
    正是为了这一点，反动派才力图使国际局势复杂化。这表现为，英国、法国和以色列侵略者进攻埃及，匈牙利发生反对人民民主制度的反革命法西斯阴谋。这一来，新世界大战的威胁马上就急剧地严重起来。然而，这两个冒险都失败了。
    为什么帝国主义者没有能够实现自己的计划呢？首先是因为，拥护和平的力量现在已经足够强大，足以制止冒险家们为了自己的目的而把各国人民推入新战争灾难之中的打算。
    现在大家都应该明白，帝国主义者想发动战争的任何企图、反动势力想侵害社会主义国家的成果的任何企图，都会受到应有的回击。
    过去一年的最重要的教训之一就是，提高人民对帝国主义侵略者的阴谋的警惕，坚决展开争取和平的斗争。毫无疑问，在即将到来的1957年中，和平力量将更加加强，这会在很大程度上有助于国际局势的好转。
    我认为，裁减军备和武装部队、禁止原子武器和氢武器，现在会对缓和国际紧张局势和巩固世界和平有很大的意义。停止扩充军备会有助于增强国际信任；缩减用于军备的庞大开支会使人民的福利得以提高。
    苏联政府曾经一再表现出主动，提出了关于裁军问题的建设性建议。此外，苏联还在这方面采取了一系列的实际措施，大大减少了自己的武装部队。捷克斯洛伐克共和国、中华人民共和国、一切社会主义国家都在巩固和平的斗争中起着积极的作用。
    建立欧洲集体安全体系对缓和国际紧张局势有着重大的意义，这无疑符合各国人民的切身利益，因为建立这种体系就能够使维护和平得到保证。
    尽量发展基于平等原则的国际经济和文化联系，曾经是并且仍然是增进各国人民的信任和了解的一个重要因素。苏联曾经主张并且仍然主张同一切国家实现广泛的、无阻碍的经济合作，主张实现不带任何歧视的合作，主张扩大文化联系。
    在我看来，争取缓和国际紧张局势和保证世界持久和平的问题就是这些。
    问：各国劳动人民今年将要庆祝重大的节日——伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年。这一天将提醒各国共产党和工人党注意，它们应当更坚定地团结在马克思列宁主义旗帜下面，应当更加坚决地为建立巩固的国际工人阶级团结而斗争。
    您认为要达到这个目的，最重要的是什么？
    答：1917年10月，我国的工人阶级和劳动人民在伟大的列宁和布尔什维克党的领导下消灭了资本主义制度，建立了工人和农民的社会主义国家。在建设新社会的道路上曾经有过巨大的困难。但是苏联人民克服了这些困难，并且建成了社会主义。
    可以完全肯定地说，1917年以后，整个国际的发展和各国人民的进步运动都受到了伟大十月社会主义革命的影响。
    随着苏联人民之后，伟大的中国、捷克斯洛伐克和欧亚两洲其他许多国家的人民也走上了社会主义的道路。组成世界社会主义体系的社会主义国家的大家庭形成了，并且在不断加强和发展。这些国家的领导和指导力量是共产党和工人党。
    苏联和各社会主义国家的工人阶级的胜利，劳动人民的胜利之所以获得，是因为这些国家的共产党和工人党的活动，一贯是以马克思列宁主义学说——唯一正确的无产阶级学说为指南的。法国、意大利和其他国家的共产党在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下为工人阶级和全体劳动人民的事业进行不调和的斗争。
    正因为如此，社会主义的敌人就集中火力来对付革命政党，首先是对付那些工人阶级已经获得胜利和建立起了政权、社会主义正在建设和已经建成的国家中的政党。
    工人阶级的敌人为了给共产主义运动制造纠纷，为了瓦解共产党和工人党队伍的团结，是不惜采取任何阴险手段的！他们特别鼓吹所谓“民族共产主义”的主张，鼓吹把十月革命所带来的而为从资本主义胜利过渡到社会主义所必需的普遍真理同各国向社会主义发展的民族特点对立起来。当然，每个国家为了取得无产阶级专政和社会主义建设的胜利而进行的斗争都有它自己的特点，这些特点是由它的民族的、历史的条件决定的。但是，不管这些特点怎样，它们不能改变社会主义革命的基本规律。片面的态度，过分强调这个或那个国家的民族特点和走向社会主义的“特殊途径”，会替这个国家的社会主义建设事业以及整个社会主义国家大家庭造成损失。
    任务是对社会主义的敌人的阴谋提高警惕，坚决反击一切破坏工人阶级及其先锋队——共产党和工人党——的团结的基础的阴谋。也还必须警惕另一些人，这些人戴着朋友的假面具，打着为社会主义而斗争的旗帜，却进行着分裂社会主义的队伍的工作，这样做是替力图瓦解革命力量的帝国主义者效劳，不论这些人是否希望这样。
    我们应当满怀着历史责任感，动员我们的力量去加强共产党和工人党，加强无产阶级团结和我们队伍的一致，团结国际工人运动的队伍，忠于马克思列宁主义原则，忠于无产阶级国际主义的原则，忠于
  “全世界无产者，联合起来！”的战斗口号。
    问：最近的事件再一次强调表明，社会主义阵营各国有必要根据苏联政府1956年10月30日的宣言所提出的原则，保持紧密的团结，实行最密切的合作。
    依您看来，在1957年加强这一合作的主要任务是什么？
    答：您说得完全对，最近的事件再一次有力地表明，社会主义阵营各国有必要保持紧密的团结，实行最密切的合作。
    苏联政府1956年10月30日的宣言中所陈述的原则曾经是并且仍然是苏联和其他社会主义国家相互关系的基础的基础。但是，遗憾的是，这些原则在过去有时遭到了破坏。这自然不能不有损社会主义各国人民的友谊，并且被敌对分子用来煽动民族主义情绪，用来削弱我们各国的团结。
    社会主义国家合作的进一步加强，要求绝对遵守尊重一切国家的民族利益的列宁主义原则，要求兄弟互助、尽量发展友好联系，让我们各国中的每一国人民都感受到这种合作的实际好处。
    社会主义国家的不可遏制的力量的泉源何在呢？在于团结一致，在于社会主义国家大家庭的巩固。这就是社会主义的新成就的保证。应当珍惜人民的这种伟大成果。
    我想提醒注意社会主义国家之间的经济联系的进一步扩大，这将有助于劳动人民的经济和福利得到新的高涨。更广泛地交流各工业部门和农业中的工作组织的经验、提高劳动生产率的经验、在生产中采用科学技术成就的经验，会起重要的作用。社会主义各国人民希望彼此更加亲近、彼此更加了解的愿望是很自然的。因此，加深和扩大相互的文化联系是很重要的。
    我们不能忘记，社会主义国家的劳动人民是在存在着资本主义国家阵营的条件下建设没有剥削者和被剥削者的新生活的，而在那里，统治阶级、它们的党和政府过去和现在都在实行反对我们各国的政策。因此，我们必需改进社会主义国家的集体防御，在国际舞台上积极维护和巩固世界和平。
    问：最近几个月的事件再次表明了捷苏友谊和兄弟关系是不可动摇的和坚固的。您可以对我们谈谈这一友谊对我们两国人民和国际局势发展的意义吗？
    答：苏联人民对我们两国人民之间由来已久的真诚的兄弟友谊和同志合作的关系评价很高。在反德国法西斯主义的战争年代里和战后时期，苏捷友谊经过了锻炼而牢固了，并且成了永恒的友谊。
    这种友谊的基础是什么呢？它的基础是我们两国人民的根本利益的一致，是在为社会主义和共产主义事业、为世界和平、为人民幸福的斗争中思想和目标的一致，是深刻地彼此尊重和信任。它是奠基在无产阶级国际主义崇高原则的基础上的，是新型的社会主义国家互相间的关系的范例。
    加强我们两国人民的友谊和兄弟团结有助于两国的经济发展和文化发展，使我们能够互相帮助和互相学习，能够更顺利地前进，能够更容易地克服困难。我们认为，捷克斯洛伐克劳动者在发展自己的国民经济和文化方面获得了许多杰出的成绩，他们有些地方是苏联人要学习的。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民和苏联人民必须小心翼翼地保护自己的友谊，尽力加强自己的友谊，不使这种友谊遭到敌人的阴谋的危害。我们应该保持警惕，应该记住，德国军国主义者在盘算着复仇计划，在准备力量来对我们两国人民、对欧洲各国人民进行新的军事冒险。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民可以信赖，苏联人民永远是他们的真挚的和可靠的朋友。
    编辑同志，请允许我祝战斗的
  “红色权利报”的读者、勤劳而能干的兄弟捷克斯洛伐克人民、光荣的捷克斯洛伐克共产党在建设自己的社会主义国家和进一步提高劳动人民福利的工作中取得成绩。
    亲爱的同志们，祝贺新年！
