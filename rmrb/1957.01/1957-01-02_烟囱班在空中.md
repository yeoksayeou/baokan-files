    The Chimney Team in the Air
    After a heavy snowfall, the biting wind felt like needles on people's faces. At the construction site of the Baotou No. 1 Engineering Office of the Beijing Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Electricity, the chimney team workers were over seventy meters above the ground, setting up iron formwork and pouring concrete, carefully tamping it. They were determined to ensure that there were no honeycombs, pockmarks, or exposed rebar in the concrete work during winter construction.
    The higher the chimney was built, the colder the climate became. Sometimes, when it was minus fourteen degrees Celsius on the ground, it was minus twenty degrees in the air. How freezing the iron tools used for tamping were! But no one complained about the cold. When encountering strong winds during operations, the chimney workers shouted the slogan "Fight the cold wind!" To complete the task ahead of schedule, those operating above refused to come down for lunch, and the chimney workers called this kind of life a "meal on top of the chimney."
    Chimney foreman Qu Hongxiang was one of the most outstanding workers. During the day, he had to direct construction, plan progress, and coordinate between various processes. At night, if workers were working there, he would also get out of bed to inspect and help workers solve problems during construction.
    Soon, a chimney eighty meters high will stand in the Baotou industrial base. (Jiang He)

    烟囱班在空中
    一场大雪过后，迎面的寒风吹在人们的脸上像针扎似的。在电力部北京基建局包头第一工程处的工地上，烟囱班的工人们在离地面七十多公尺的高空中，支铁合子板、打混凝土，细心地捣固着。他们要在冬季施工中，不使混凝土工程有一点儿蜂窝、麻面和露筋。
    烟囱越筑越高，上面的气候就越冷。有的时候，地面上是摄氏零下十四度，在高空就是零下二十度。捣固时用的铁工具多冻手呀！但是没有人喊过冷。在操作中遇到刮大风，烟囱工人们就喊出“与寒风搏斗”的口号。为了提前完成任务，这些在上面操作的人，中午的那一顿饭是不肯下来吃的，烟囱工人们把这样的生活称为“烟囱顶上聚餐”。
    烟囱班长曲洪祥，是工作最出色的一个。白天他要指挥施工，要规划进度和各工序间的配合；晚间要有工人在那里工作，他也要从被窝里爬起来检查，帮助工人们解决施工中的问题。
    不久以后，一座高达八十公尺的烟囱，就要在包头工业基地树立起来了。　（江　河）
