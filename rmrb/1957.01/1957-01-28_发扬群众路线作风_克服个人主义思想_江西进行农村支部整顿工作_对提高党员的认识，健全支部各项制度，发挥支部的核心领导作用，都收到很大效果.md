Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 27th: The CCP Jiangxi Provincial Gannan District Committee and various local and county committees have launched rural branch rectification work.

Based on the experience of past rectification combined with agricultural collectivization, the party committees at all levels carefully formulated plans for winter party rectification. In order to ensure the smooth progress of party rectification, a large number of leading cadres were dispatched. The Nanchang District Committee alone selected 2,075 party member cadres with good ideological quality, strong principles, and experience in branch work to serve as party rectification organizers. Counties also trained a large number of township general branch secretaries and agricultural cooperative cadres to strengthen the leadership of party rectification.

The general approach to party rectification in various localities is to start with inspecting and organizing winter production in agricultural cooperatives, organizing cadres and party members to study the "Eighth National Congress" documents and the Party Constitution, and focusing on resolving and overcoming issues arising from some party organizations and members' lack of understanding of the new situation after rural collectivization, such as coercive commandism, unclear demarcation between socialism and capitalism in the operational policies of agricultural cooperatives, as well as the individualistic thinking of a few party members who were corrupt, wasteful, and unwilling to work in rural areas; to promote the Party's mass line style of work. During the rectification, achievements and shortcomings in the work were identified, the reasons for the shortcomings were analyzed, and methods for improvement were studied, protecting the socialist enthusiasm of cadres.

This party rectification has achieved significant results in enhancing party members' understanding, establishing and improving various branch systems, and enhancing the core leadership role of branches. According to statistics from five counties in the Jiujiang area, after the rectification, the quality of the rural party underwent significant changes due to the increased political enthusiasm of party members and the improved level of branch work: the number of branches with good work increased from the original 35.4% to 58.8%, the number of medium branches decreased from 44.6% to 35.4%, and the number of relatively poor branches decreased from 18% to 5.8%. After party rectification in the Shangrao area, more than 95% of party members in rural areas played an exemplary and vanguard role in promoting production, enabling all 2,297 advanced cooperatives built in the region last year to be consolidated.

Due to the effects generated by party rectification, the idea held by some party members that party rectification was in conflict with the central tasks has been increasingly dispelled, and rectifying and improving the work of rural party branches has been valued as a regular task by party organizations in most areas.

    发扬群众路线作风　克服个人主义思想
    江西进行农村支部整顿工作
    对提高党员的认识，健全支部各项制度，发挥支部的核心领导作用，都收到很大效果
    新华社南昌27日电　中共江西省赣南区委和各地委、各县委都开展了农村支部的整顿工作。
    各级党委在总结了以往整社结合整党经验的基础上，周密地拟订了冬季整党的计划。为了使整党顺利进行，并派出了大批领导骨干。仅南昌地委就挑选了二千零七十五个思想品质好、原则性强和具有支部工作经验的党员干部，担任整党组织员。各县还训练了大批乡总支书记和办社干部，充实整党的领导力量。
    各地整党工作一般都是从检查和组织农业合作社的冬季生产入手，组织干部党员学习“八大”文件和党的章程；着重解决和克服部分党组织与党员因对农村合作化后的新情况缺乏认识，而出现的强迫命令作风，和在农业社的经营方针上社会主义与资本主义界限划分不清现象，以及少数党员贪污浪费和不安心农村工作的个人主义思想；发扬党的群众路线作风。在整党中找出了工作中的成绩和缺点，并分析发生缺点的原因，研究改进的办法，保护干部的社会主义积极性。
    这次整党对提高党员认识，建立与健全支部的各项制度，发挥支部的核心领导作用，都收到了很大的效果。据九江专区五个县的统计，在整党后，由于党员政治热情高涨，支部工作水平提高，农村党的质量起了显著的变化：工作较好的支部由原来的35.4％增加到58.8％，中等支部由44.6％下降到35.4％，比较差的支部由18％下降到5.8％。上饶专区经过整党后，95％以上的在农村里的党员都发挥了模范先锋作用，推动了生产，使全区去年建成的二千二百九十七个高级社都能巩固了下来。
    由于整党所产生的效果，使部分党员原认为整党与中心工作有矛盾的思想已日益清除，整顿提高农村党的支部工作，已为绝大部分地区的党组织作为经常性的工作而重视起来。
