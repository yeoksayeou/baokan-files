The Chinese People's Liberation Army Xinjiang Military Region troops, offices, schools, and hospitals have achieved great success in their work of supporting the government and cherishing the people over the past year.

Around the Spring Festival last year, in order to support agricultural cooperatives in their production, the officers and soldiers of the Military Region saved their salaries and allowances and purchased more than 360 sets (vehicles) of major farm tools such as double-wheeled double-share plows, walking plows, cultivators, and seeders to give to the cooperatives; they also donated more than 100 head of livestock such as horses, camels, and oxen to the agricultural cooperatives. At the same time, all officers and soldiers and wage-earning staff working in the troops donated more than 350,000 yuan to help farmers establish "People's Liberation Army Tractor Stations." Throughout the year, the troops also sent a large amount of fertilizer to the agricultural cooperatives.

Last year, the offices and troops, amidst their intense military training, all officers and soldiers used their holidays to participate in voluntary labor, helping agricultural cooperatives with planting, wheat harvesting, weeding, and road repairs. Due to the strong support from the troops in terms of materials and manpower to the cooperatives, all 107 cooperatives directly supported by the Military Region troops increased production last year.

Last year, the offices and troops also helped many cooperatives establish accounting books and trained a total of more than 200 accountants, medical personnel, and teachers for people's schools. The troops also independently established three people's schools. At the same time, they helped the cooperatives establish 26 libraries and donated more than 30,000 books of various kinds.

    新疆军区部队帮助农民生产有成绩
    本报讯　中国人民解放军新疆军区部队、机关、学校和医院，一年来拥政爱民的工作获得很大成绩。
    去年春节前后，军区部队的官兵们，为了支援农业合作社进行生产，他们节省了自己的薪金和津贴，购买了双轮双铧犁、步犁、中耕器、播种机和大车等主要农具共三百六十多架（辆）送给了合作社；还赠送给农业合作社马匹、骆驼、耕牛等牲畜一百多头。同时，全体官兵和在部队工作的工薪制职员，为了帮助农民兄弟建立“人民解放军拖拉机站”，共捐献了三十五万多元。一年来各部队还给农业合作社送了大量的肥料。
    各机关、部队去年还在紧张的军事训练中，全体官兵利用假日参加了义务劳动，帮助农业合作社种地、割麦、除草和修路等。由于部队从物力、人力对合作社的大力支援，受到军区部队直接支援的一百零七个合作社去年都增产了。
    各机关、部队去年还帮助许多合作社建立会计账目，培养了会计、医务、民校教员共二百多人，部队还单独开办了民校三所。同时，还帮助合作社建立了二十六个图书馆，赠送的各种书籍三万多册。
