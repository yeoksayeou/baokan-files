Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 2nd: Vientiane Radio reported that Prince Souphanouvong delivered a speech to the Lao people on January 1st, stating that this was his second time in Vientiane to meet with Souvanna Phouma in an effort to implement the joint communiqués signed on August 5th and 10th, 1956. The atmosphere of the talks was more amicable than in the past, and a new joint communiqué was signed. This represents a victory and progress in uniting all Lao people to achieve genuine unification for Laos.

Souphanouvong said that regarding the return to national collective life, the Lao Patriotic Front would base its actions on the following policies:

Internally, unite the entire people, including all ethnic groups, religions, and parties, to jointly implement the Geneva Agreements and other agreements already signed, and to support the government led by Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma; guarantee that all Lao people can enjoy all democratic freedoms and rights; improve the people's lives; eliminate illiteracy, etc.

Externally, resolutely implement a policy of peace and neutrality; establish diplomatic relations with all countries, especially neighboring countries, regardless of political system; accept aid without strings or supervision; not join any military alliances; and not allow any country to establish military bases on Lao territory. Only in this way can the peace and neutrality of Laos be guaranteed, and Laos can achieve independence, unity, democracy, and prosperity.

Souphanouvong said that the Lao Patriotic Forces would sincerely return to national common life and cooperate with the Kingdom side.

    苏发努冯元旦对老挝人民讲话
    老挝保持和平中立才能富强
    新华社河内2日电　据万象电台广播：苏发努冯亲王1日对老挝人民发表讲话，他说，这是他第二次到万象同梭发那·富马会谈，以设法实现1956年8月5日和10日两次签订的联合公报。会谈气氛比过去亲密，并且签订了新的联合公报。这是把一切老挝人团结起来，以使老挝得到真正统一的一个胜利和一个进展。
    苏发努冯说，关于返回国家集体生活这件事，寮国方面将以下述政策为根据：
    在对内方面，团结全民，即各民族、宗教、各党派，以便共同履行日内瓦协议和已经签订的其他协议，拥护梭发那·富马亲王首相领导的政府；保证所有老挝人民能够享受一切民主自由权利；改善人民的生活；扫除文盲等。
    在对外方面，坚决实现和平中立政策；不分政治制度，同各国特别是同各邻国建立外交关系；接受没有束缚和没有监察的援助；不加入任何军事联盟；不让任何国家在老挝领土上建立军事基地。这样，才能够保证老挝的和平中立，老挝才能得到独立、统一、民主和富强。
    苏发努冯说，寮国战斗部队将诚挚地返回国家共同生活，同王国方面合作。
