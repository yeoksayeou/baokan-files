Xinhua News Agency, London, January 20th: The Yemenese Legation in Britain issued a communique on the 19th, once again accusing Britain of aggression against Yemen by using the Aden Protectorate.

The communique said: "British troops, possessing cannons, tanks, and aircraft, have reached the outskirts of the Yemenese city of Harib and have surrounded the city."

The communique also said that Yemen had suggested holding negotiations with Britain in December of last year to discuss past events, "but the British government did not take this suggestion seriously, which proves Britain's lack of sincerity." The communique then pointed out: "If Britain had responded to Yemen's wishes at that time, the innocent bloodshed caused by Britain's fierce attack on Yemen would not have occurred, nor would the destruction of Yemenese cities and villages have taken place. During Britain's fierce attack, Britain used bombs, rockets, and other destructive weapons."

    也门驻英国公使馆谴责英国加紧侵犯也门
    据新华社20日讯　伦敦消息：也门驻英国公使馆19日发表公报，再次指责英国利用亚丁保护地侵略也门的行动。
    公报说：“拥有大炮、坦克和飞机的英国军队已经到达也门哈里布城的郊外，并且包围了这个城市。”
    公报又说，也门在去年12月曾经建议同英国举行谈判，以便讨论过去发生的事件，“但是英国政府并没有认真地看待这项建议，这就证明了英国缺乏诚意”。公报接着指出：“如果英国在那个时候就对也门的愿望有所反应，那就不会发生在英国猛烈进攻也门期间所引起的无辜的流血，也不会造成也门的城市和乡村被摧毁。在英国的猛烈进攻中，英国使用了炸弹、火箭和其他毁灭性的武器。”
