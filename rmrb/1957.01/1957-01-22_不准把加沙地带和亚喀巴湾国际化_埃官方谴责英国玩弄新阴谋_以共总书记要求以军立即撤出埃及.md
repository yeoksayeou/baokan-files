Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 21st. An Egyptian official said on the evening of the 19th that Britain's attempt to place the Gaza Strip under international control and to internationalize the Gulf of Aqaba is a continuation of its conspiracy with Israel against Egypt and against the Arab people of Palestine. He said that this attempt violates the United Nations resolution requiring Israel to withdraw to the armistice line.

The official's words were directed at the statement made by the British representative to the United Nations during the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the issue of the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Egypt.

The official said that Egypt will never tolerate such a conspiracy and insists that Israel should implement the United Nations resolution.

The official said that Egypt has already agreed to clear the canal in accordance with the United Nations resolution, and Egypt is also providing as much convenience as possible for the canal clearance work. If Britain intends to allow Israel to benefit from its aggression, this will greatly complicate the issue.

The official also said that any attempt to turn the United Nations Emergency Force into an occupation force and affect Egyptian sovereignty will be rejected. He said that the Egyptian government agreed to allow the force to enter Egypt on the basis that its sovereignty should be fully maintained. He pointed out that the United Nations resolution on the establishment of the United Nations Emergency Force stipulates that this force can only carry out its mission with the consent of the Egyptian government.

The official said that the current attempt to use the United Nations Emergency Force to achieve the aggressive goals of the colonialists is a deliberate attempt to undermine trust in the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, January 21st. TASS, Tel Aviv, January 20th. According to "People's Voice," the Secretary-General of the Israeli Communist Party, Mikunis, speaking at a mass rally in Tel Aviv, demanded that the Israeli army immediately and completely withdraw from Egyptian territory and demanded the rejection of the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

The大会 passed a resolution demanding that the Israeli government immediately withdraw its troops from Egypt, no longer collude with the colonialists, and recognize the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine.

    不准把加沙地带和亚喀巴湾国际化
    埃官方谴责英国玩弄新阴谋
    以共总书记要求以军立即撤出埃及
    新华社开罗21日电　埃及一位官方人士19日晚间说，英国企图使加沙地带归国际管制以及使亚喀巴湾国际化的做法，是它串通以色列反对埃及和反对巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人的阴谋的继续。他说，这种企图违反联合国规定以色列退到停战线后面的决议。
    这位人士的话是针对英国驻联合国代表在联合国大会讨论以色列部队撤出埃及问题时的发言而说的。
    这位人士说，埃及决不能容忍这种阴谋，它坚持以色列应当执行联合国决议。
    这位人士说，埃及已经同意依照联合国决议来清理运河，埃及还尽可能为清理运河工作提供便利。如果英国打算使以色列通过它的侵略得到好处，这将使问题大大复杂化。
    这位人士还说，任何企图使联合国紧急部队成为占领军而影响埃及主权的做法，一定会遭到拒绝。他说，埃及政府是在它的主权应该得到充分维护这一基础上同意让这支部队进入埃及的。他指出，联合国关于成立联合国紧急部队的决议规定，这支部队只能在得到埃及政府的同意以后才能执行任务。
    这位人士说，现在企图利用联合国紧急部队来实现殖民者的侵略目的的做法是蓄意要破坏对联合国的信任。
    新华社21日讯　塔斯社特拉维夫20日讯：据“人民呼声报”报道，以色列共产党总书记米库尼斯在特拉维夫的群众大会上讲话，要求以色列军队立刻完全撤出埃及领土，并且要求拒绝“艾森豪威尔主义”。
    大会通过决议，要求以色列政府立刻从埃及撤回军队，不再同殖民主义者勾结，承认巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人的正当的民族权利。
