    Persist in Spare-Time Learning to Improve Teacher Quality
    Primary School Teachers Nationwide Participate in Further Studies
    (Our Dispatch) Spare-time further education for primary school teachers is rapidly developing throughout the country. According to recent incomplete statistics, 23 provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, Henan, Beijing, and Shanghai, have established over 720 spare-time further education schools and correspondence normal schools (correspondence departments) for primary school teachers, with approximately 450,000 teachers participating in studies. Currently, over 100,000 teachers nationwide who are below the level of junior normal school have completed the Chinese language and arithmetic courses, reaching the graduation level of junior normal school.
    Through spare-time further education, the quality of primary school teachers has significantly improved. Harbin City has been running teacher in-service training schools since 1950, and over the past seven years, it has trained and improved a large number of primary school teachers. In the autumn of 1952, the city promoted many teachers from junior primary schools to teach senior primary school courses, and they were all able to cheerfully and competently fulfill the subjects they taught. In the Neijiang Special District of Sichuan Province, more than 70 teachers have also reached the level of graduation from secondary normal school after undergoing spare-time further education.
    Under the care of local Party committees and administrations, and especially after the CPC Central Committee put forward the call to "march towards science," the enthusiasm of teachers for learning has generally increased. In the three northeastern provinces, the attendance rate of teachers participating in further education often reaches over 90%. Many teachers have formulated plans to march towards culture and science, and have automatically organized self-study groups, persisting in spare-time self-study. They have made significant improvements in political theory, culture and science, and professional knowledge.
    In the work of spare-time further education for teachers, there are still some problems. In some places, the work of spare-time further education for teachers only remains at general appeals, lacking concrete ideological and organizational guidance and assistance, and in some individual places, teachers' learning is even restricted. Some teachers are not clear enough about the direction and purpose of learning, and they put learning in opposition to work, and individual interests in opposition to national needs, thinking that "to march forward, one must enter a school"; some are not at ease with their teaching work and even slacken their education and teaching work; some emphasize that only by entering further education schools and correspondence schools can one improve, neglecting hard self-study; and some comrades think that the purpose of "marching forward" is to become some kind of "director" or "associate doctor," while paying insufficient attention to improving education and teaching work and actively summarizing work experience. In addition, multiple leadership in learning and excessively high demands have caused confusion and excessive burdens for teachers' learning.
    Currently, the Ministry of Education is widely soliciting opinions from all parties regarding teacher in-service training in order to further effectively improve teacher in-service training work.

    坚持业余学习　提高师资质量
    全国广大小学教师参加进修
    本报讯　小学教师业余进修工作在全国各地迅速开展。根据最近不完全的统计，江苏、河南、北京、上海等二十三个省、市已经建立了七百二十余处小学教师业余进修学校和函授师范学校（函授部），参加学习的教师约有四十五万人。目前全国约有十万多不及初级师范水平的教师，已经学完了语文、算术两科，达到初级师范毕业程度。
    通过业余进修，小学师资质量有了显著的提高。哈尔滨市自1950年开始举办教师进修学校，七年来，培养提高了大批小学教师。1952年秋，该市提升了许多初小教师担任高小课程，他们都能愉快地胜任所教学科。四川省内江专区七十多位教师，经过业余进修，也全部达到中等师范毕业程度。
    在各地党委和行政的关怀下，特别是中共中央提出“向科学进军”的号召以后，教师们的学习热情普遍高涨。东北三省参加进修教师的出席率经常达到90％以上，很多教师制定了向文化科学进军的规划，自动组织了自学小组，坚持业余自学。他们在政治理论文化科学和业务知识等方面，都有显著的提高。
    在教师业余进修工作中，目前还存在一些问题。有些地方对于教师业余进修工作只停留在一般号召，缺乏思想上、组织上的具体指导和帮助，个别地方甚至限制教师学习。有些教师对于学习的方向和目的不够明确，把学习同工作对立起来，把个人兴趣同国家需要对立起来，认为“要进军就要进学校”；有的不安心教师工作甚至放松了教育和教学工作；有的人强调只有入进修学校、函授学校才能提高，忽视了刻苦自学；还有些同志认为“进军”的目的是当上什么“长”、“副博士”，而对于改进教育、教学工作，积极总结工作经验，则注意得十分不够。此外，学习上领导多头，要求过高，造成了教师学习的忙乱以及负担过重现象。
    目前，教育部正在广泛征求各方面对于教师进修的意见，以便进一步切实地改进教师进修工作。
