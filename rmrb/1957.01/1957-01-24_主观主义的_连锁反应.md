Subjectivism's "Chain Reaction"
　　Zé Tiěshēng

Many comrades, when speaking at meetings, giving reports in public, drafting documents, summarizing work, or writing articles, like to cite hearsay materials, and even exaggerate and distort these materials at will, spreading rumors and reporting them level by level, causing many jokes.

There was such an incident in Tangshan City: At the "May Day" celebration meeting last year, a cadre from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions heard workers from the Desheng Porcelain Factory report that "a worker fell asleep on his bicycle on the way home because he was overworked due to continuous overtime." If this were really the case, it would be a very serious matter; as a leading body, it should quickly send people to investigate and verify it. But unfortunately, the Tangshan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions did not do this. At the labor protection meeting held in Tangshan City in early May, the above-mentioned fact was cited to criticize the Desheng Porcelain Factory for working overtime. At that time, the leaders of the Desheng Porcelain Factory raised objections, stating that there was no such thing in their factory. In order to clarify the truth of this matter, the Labor Protection Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions specially sent cadres to "go deep" into the Desheng Porcelain Factory for inspection. The cadres who went down to investigate found the worker who originally reported the situation. According to this worker, "I didn't say it was the Desheng Porcelain Factory's matter at the time, it might be the Tangshan Power Plant's matter." After such a verification, our cadre "reported the facts as they were." As a result, at another meeting, the leaders of the Tangshan Power Plant were criticized by name for not caring about the safety of workers and arbitrarily working overtime, and it was cited as an example: "The power plant worker Zhou Fengzhen worked overtime continuously for four days without rest, and he fell asleep on the road while riding his bicycle home." This sudden criticism surprised several leaders of the power plant. They immediately checked back at the factory and found that there was neither such a thing nor such a person. They immediately asked the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to make corrections, and the reply was: "This situation is from the provincial party committee's materials, let's talk about it later!" Since then, there has been no news. Unexpectedly, on July 30th, an author named Ding Jing published this fabricated overtime situation in the People's Daily in an article entitled "Cash Transaction." But the matter did not end there. On November 27th, Comrade Xiren also wrote an article in the Tangshan Labor Daily, criticizing some cadres for not conducting investigation and research, "just making a big fuss based on hearsay." In his critique, he also cited the example of Zhou Fengzhen. Although Comrade Xiren pointed out that "he (Zhou Fengzhen) neither fell asleep on his bicycle, nor did he fall into the ditch and remain unconscious, he only had a very ordinary traffic accident," explaining that "the appearance of such a moving scene is the result of people's spreading." But while correcting other people's mistakes, he himself made a mistake. He mistakenly affirmed that Zhou Fengzhen "was not in the Desheng Porcelain Factory, but in the power plant."

This subjective style of not conducting investigation and research work, and not verifying the facts, is the root of this kind of big joke and should be eradicated completely!

    主观主义的“连锁反应”
    泽铁生
    不少同志在会上发言，当众作报告时，在起草文件、作工作总结，或者在写文章时，总喜欢引用一些道听途说的材料，甚至将这些材料，任意夸大歪曲，以讹传讹，层层上报，闹出很多笑话。
    在唐山市有这样一件事：去年“五一”劳动节庆祝大会上，市工会联合会某干部听德盛磁厂工人反映“一工人因连续加班，疲劳过度，骑自行车回家时，竟在半路上睡着了”。假如情况果真如此，这是很严重的事；作为一个领导机关，应该很快派人深入下去加以调查和对证。但可惜的是唐山市工会联合会并没有这样作，就在5月上旬唐山市召开的劳动保护会议上，引证了上述事实，批评了德盛磁厂的加班加点。当时德盛磁厂领导上曾提出意见，声明该厂并无此事。为了弄清这件事情的真相，会后市工会劳保部特派干部“深入”德盛磁厂检查。下去调查的干部找到了原来反映情况的工人，据这个工人说：“当时我并未说这是德盛磁厂的事，可能是唐山发电厂的事。”经过了这样一番对证，我们这位干部就“据实上报”。于是在另一次会议上，又指名批评了唐山发电厂领导上不关心工人安全，任意加班加点，并举例说：“电厂工人周凤珍连续加班，四天没有休息，他在骑着自行车回家的时候，就倒在路上睡着了”。这个突如其来的批评，使发电厂的几个领导干部大吃一惊，回厂立即检查，结果是既无此事，又无此人。随即要求市工会给予更正，答复说：“这个情况是省委的材料，等以后再说吧！”从此以后，就渺无音讯了。不料在7月30日的人民日报上，一个署名丁井的作者，以“现钱交易”为题，又把这个捏造的加班加点情况公之于世。但事情并未到此结束，11月27日，希人同志在唐山劳动日报上也写了文章，批评某些干部不作调查研究，“只凭道听途说就大作文章”。在他的批评稿中也援引了周凤珍的例子。虽然希人同志指出“他（周凤珍）既没有骑在车子上睡觉，也没有摔到沟里后仍在昏睡，他只不过是出了一次极普通的行车事故而已”，说明“所以出现那样动人的情景，是人们传诵的结果”。但他在纠正别人错误的时候，他自己又发生了错误，他错误地肯定了周凤珍“并不在德盛磁厂，而是发电厂的”。
    这种不作调查研究工作，不作事实核对工作的主观主义的作风，就是这一类大笑话的根源，应该把它连根拔掉！
