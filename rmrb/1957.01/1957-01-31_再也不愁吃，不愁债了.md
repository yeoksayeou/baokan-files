In previous years, many grain-deficient farmers in Pucheng County, Shaanxi Province, were carrying sacks everywhere to borrow grain to prepare for the Spring Festival at this time. Local folk songs described the hardship of "borrowing year wheat" like this: "Borrow to eat, work to repay, spending the year following the millstone." But this scene is no longer visible this year.

Now, in the rural areas of Pucheng County, the sound of grinding flour can be heard everywhere. In the middle of the night, you can still hear the wheezing of bellows stoking the fire to steam steamed buns. In Donglu Cooperative of Bailu Township and Xianfeng Cooperative of Xiangcun Township, where grain-deficient households accounted for about three-quarters in previous years, no household is short of grain this year. Li Shuxian, a member of Xianfeng Cooperative, used to borrow grain to get through the Spring Festival last year. Now, his family has enough grain to eat for two years. Wangjiacun Cooperative was also a grain-deficient cooperative in the past, but now every household has surplus grain. To commemorate the benefits brought by collectivization, they named the three children newly born in winter "Gao She" (High Cooperative), "Jin She" (Enter Cooperative), and "Zhuan She" (Turn Cooperative), respectively. The mothers have made new clothes for them and made delicious "Jing Gao" (auspicious cake) with soft millet mixed with date paste. Liang Zhengyi, a member of the former Qunying Township Cooperative, was afraid that he would not get much grain in the cooperative after joining it last year, so he requested to withdraw from the cooperative thirteen times. Now, he has been allocated so much grain that he cannot finish it. On the twenty-third day of the twelfth lunar month, he posted a large red paper strip on the granary, with the words "Granary Full" written on it. He said: "I won't leave the cooperative even if I'm carried in an eight-person sedan chair."

Before the Spring Festival this year, the debt burden of farmers in this county also underwent a fundamental change. In the past, the relatively poor townships of Guangyang, Xiangcun, Yuanren, and Bailu generally had no agricultural cooperative members who had to borrow money to get through the Spring Festival this year, and many people also paid off their outstanding debts from previous years and state loans. The farmers of Bafu Village in Xiangcun Township, although their lives gradually improved after liberation, had not stopped going bankrupt due to debt. This year is their first "debt-free year." The whole village used more than 4,000 yuan in state loans during the spring famine last year, but now it has basically been repaid, and many people have also deposited money in the credit cooperative. Ren Jingcheng, a member of Donglu Cooperative in Bailu Township, used to lack food and clothing every year, and his debt to private individuals and the state had reached more than 600 yuan since liberation. In previous years, he worried about the "end-of-year" hurdle every year in the twelfth lunar month. However, after the distribution last year, he paid off all his debts at once. Now, his family has added new clothes and is happily preparing for the Spring Festival.

In 1956, although more than 95% of cooperative members in Pucheng County increased their income compared with previous years, there were still 5% of cooperative members whose lives were difficult due to reduced income. Before the Spring Festival, each agricultural cooperative generally conducted visits to these cooperative members, pre-paid them the remuneration for this year's labor days, or allocated funds from the public welfare fund for relief. According to statistics from Bailu Township, agricultural cooperatives have paid out about 6,000 yuan to households in difficulty, helping them solve the difficulties of getting through the Spring Festival.

Pucheng County, located on the Weibei Plateau, has historically been a county constantly plagued by famine. According to the local "County Chronicle," because "Puyi's terrain is high and dry, relying entirely on heavenly dew," so "years may not be harvested," and famine victims fled in all directions. In the nearly sixty or seventy years before liberation, there were four major famines. Each time, the number of famine victims reached more than 100,000. Small disasters occurred almost every year. The county's population once decreased from more than 300,000 to more than 100,000. Although production has increased year by year since liberation, the lives of farmers are still relatively poor. Until 1955, about 60% of the county's households were still short of grain. However, in the first year of collectivization last year, due to the high enthusiasm of farmers for production, and the change of cultivation from extensive to intensive; coupled with good natural conditions, the county's total grain output was more than 110 million jin more than the highest year of 1954. The county's grain output has reached "one jin of surplus for every jin cultivated." The shortage of grain has been eliminated among agricultural cooperative members. Before the Spring Festival, the farmers of this county had sold more than 80 million jin of grain to the state and repaid more than 80% of the state's overdue loans. The farmers' deposits in banks and credit cooperatives averaged more than four yuan per person in the county.

    再也不愁吃，不愁债了
    新华社记者　沈其如
    往年这个时候，陕西省蒲城县的许多缺粮农民正在挟着口袋到处借粮准备过春节。当地民谣形容这种“借年麦”的苦况的时候说：“借着吃，打着还，跟着碌碡过个年。”但是今年这种景象已经见不到了。
    现在，在蒲城县的农村里到处都是隆隆地磨面声。半夜里还可听见煽火蒸馍的风箱呼嗒呼嗒声。往年缺粮户占到四分之三左右的白卤乡东鲁社和翔村乡先锋社，今年没有一户缺粮。先锋社的社员李树贤去年还是借粮过年的，现在，家里的粮食够吃两年。王家村社过去也是个缺粮社，现在家家户户有余粮。他们为了纪念合作化带来的好处，给在冬季新诞生的三个小孩分别命名为“高社”、“进社”和“转社”。母亲们已为他们作了新衣，并用软糜子和着枣泥做了可口的“景糕”。原任乡群英社社员梁正义，去年入社不久，怕在社里分不到多少粮食，曾经十三次要求退社。现在，他分得的粮食多得吃不了，在旧历腊月二十三那天，他在粮仓上贴了一张大红纸条，上写着“粮食满仓”四个字。他说：“用八人轿抬我也不出社了。”
    今年春节前，这个县的农民债务负担也起了根本变化，过去比较贫困的广阳、翔村、原任和白卤等几个乡，今年农业社员中一般还都没有借债过春节的，很多人还清了历年的陈账和国家的贷款。翔村乡八福村农民，解放后虽然生活逐渐上升，但是因为债务而破产的也还没有断绝。今年是他们第一个“无债年”。全村去年春荒的时候曾用国家贷款四千多元，现在已经基本还清，很多人还在信用社里存了款。白卤乡东鲁社社员任敬诚，过去年年缺吃缺穿，从解放后起亏欠私人和国家的债款已经达到六百多元。往年一到腊月就愁“年关”难过。但是在去年决分后一下子就把全部债务都还清了。现在他一家人都添置了新衣服，欢天喜地的准备过春节。
    1956年，蒲城县虽然有95％以上的社员比往年增加了收入，但是还有5％的社员因收入减少生活发生困难。对于这些社员，各农业社在春节前都普遍进行了访问，给他们预支今年劳动日的报酬，或从公益金中拨款救济。据白卤乡统计，农业社已支给困难户六千元左右，帮助他们解决了过春节的困难。
    地处渭北高原的蒲城县，在历史上从来就是饥荒不断的一个县。据当地“县志”记载，因为“蒲邑地势高燥，全赖天泽”，所以“岁或不登”饥民便四出逃荒。在解放前近六、七十年中，就曾先后发生四次大灾荒。每次饥民都达到十万人以上。小灾则几乎连年不断。全县人口曾一度由三十多万减少到十多万。解放后虽然生产连年上升，但是农民的生活还是比较贫困。直到1955年，全县仍有60％左右的农户缺粮。但是在去年合作化的第一年中，由于农民生产热情很高，耕作由粗放变为精作；加以自然条件较好，全县粮食总产量比最高的1954年还多产一亿一千多万斤。全县粮食产量已达到了“耕一余一”。在农业社员中已经消灭了缺粮情况。春节以前，这个县的农民已把八千多万斤粮食卖给国家，归还了80％以上的国家到期贷款。农民们在银行和信用社中的存款，全县平均每人有四元多。
