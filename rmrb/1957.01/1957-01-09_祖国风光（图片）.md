    Scenery of the Motherland
    The Xiamen-Jimei Seawall, which connects Xiamen Island and the mainland, is like two beautiful stone-built belts, horizontally binding the sea surface between Jimei, Xinglin, and Jimei, Gaoqi. The seawall is flat and wide, allowing vehicles, horses, and pedestrians to travel freely. The picture shows the Xiamen Seawall.

    祖国风光
    把厦门岛和大陆连结起来的厦门、集美海堤像两条美丽的石砌腰带，横束在集美、杏林和集美、高崎之间的海面上，海堤平坦宽阔，车马行人自由畅行。图中是厦门海堤。
