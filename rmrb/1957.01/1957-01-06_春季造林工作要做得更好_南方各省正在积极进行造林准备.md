　　Spring Afforestation Work Must Be Done Better
　　Southern Provinces Are Actively Preparing for Afforestation
　　(Our Newspaper) News: Southern provinces are actively preparing for spring afforestation, so as to start afforestation earlier in the spring of 1957.
　　The newly established Greening Committee of Zhejiang Province has begun its work. The committee summarized the experiences and lessons of afforestation in 1956 and arranged the spring afforestation work for 1957. The Greening Committees of various counties in the province have also been established one after another, so as to uniformly arrange forestry production in rural areas. Now the Forestry Department of Zhejiang Province has sent six working groups to various districts to check the preparation work for spring afforestation. All counties in Guangdong Province have generally established afforestation and forest protection production headquarters. When preparing for afforestation work, Sichuan Province also focused on solving the issue of afforestation remuneration within cooperatives. Nanbu County conducted key investigations in various cooperatives in advance, and put forward preliminary opinions on various quotas, so that forestry labor quotas were simultaneously incorporated into agricultural production plans, laying the foundation for work evaluation and point recording, avoiding the phenomenon of being abandoned in the past because there was no remuneration method. In addition, various counties have also carried out the work of training forestry personnel.
　　In the specific arrangement and inspection of seed collection, seedling cultivation, and land preparation, southern provinces emphasized the issue of guaranteeing and improving the survival rate of afforestation. As of the end of 1956, Hunan Province had collected more than 4.48 million catties of various tree seeds, completing 78% of the total task, and 22 counties in the province had completed and overfulfilled the collection task. State-owned forest farms across the province have completed more than 64,000 mu of land preparation work. Qianyang District has burned and reclaimed more than 237,000 mu of forest land. The province plans to afforest 3 million mu in the winter of 1956 and the spring of 1957, requiring a survival rate of over 90%. Now, various counties are planning the forest land for planting fir, pine, oil tea, tung oil and other tree species according to the natural conditions. Guangdong Province has collected more than 5.95 million catties of seeds, accounting for 54% of the seed collection plan, of which more than 800,000 catties of fir and pine have been collected. Many counties have held small-scale symposiums, established seed treatment stations, and promoted seed treatment technology. Guangdong Province is preparing to cultivate the seedlings needed for the more than 3,700 mu of soil and water conservation forests planned to be built in various places.

    春季造林工作要做得更好
    南方各省正在积极进行造林准备
    本报讯　南方各省积极进行春季造林准备工作，以便在1957年春季提前开始造林。
    浙江省新成立的绿化委员会已开始办公。该会总结了1956年造林的经验教训，并布置了1957年春季造林工作。这个省的各县绿化委员会也相继建立，以便在农村中统一安排林业生产。现在浙江省林业厅已派出六个工作组，到各专区检查春季造林的准备工作。广东省各县普遍建立了造林、护林生产指挥部。四川省在准备造林工作时，还着重解决合作社内造林报酬问题。南部县事先在各合作社进行重点摸底，提出各项定额的初步意见，使林业劳动定额同时纳入农业生产计划，奠定评工记分的基础，避免了像过去因为没有计酬办法而被丢掉的现象产生。此外各县并开展了训练林业员的工作。
    南方各省在采种育苗和整地工作具体布置和检查中，强调了保证提高造林成活率的问题。截至1956年年底，湖南省已采集各种树种四百四十八万多斤，完成总任务的78％，全省有二十二个县完成和超额完成采集任务。全省国营林场已完成六万四千多亩的整地工作。黔阳专区已烧垦林二十三万七千多亩。全省1956年冬和1957年春计划造林三百万亩，要求保证成活率达到90％以上。现在各县正在根据自然条件分别规划出营造杉、松、油茶、油桐等树种的林地。广东省已采种五百九十五万多斤，占采种计划的54％，其中杉、松已采集八十多万斤。不少县召开了小型座谈会，设立种子处理站，推广种子处理技术。广东省各地对于计划营造的三千七百多亩水土保持林所需要的苗木，正在准备培育。
