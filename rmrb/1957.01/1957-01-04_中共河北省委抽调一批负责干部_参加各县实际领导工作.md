    The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Draws a Batch of Responsible Cadres to Participate in the Actual Leadership Work of Various Counties

    (Our Newspaper News) The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently transferred 248 cadres at the level of section chief and above from provincial-level agencies to help with work in rural areas. This included 44 cadres at the level of bureau/department director and 204 cadres at the level of section chief. Zhu Ziqiang, member of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of Propaganda, has decided to go to Ding County; Sun Kechuan and Liu Zhenbang, Deputy Directors of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, will go to Anguo and Laiyuan respectively; and Li Guoqing, Deputy Director of the Provincial Meteorological Bureau, will go to Fuping. They will all hold substantive positions this time, some serving as the second secretary or deputy secretary of the county party committee, and others as members of the county party committee.

    Based on the current rural situation in Hebei Province, it is of great significance to transfer this group of cadres with high policy understanding and rural work experience to the grassroots level to help with work. This year is the first year of advanced cooperativization in rural Hebei, and the work has achieved certain results. Production has increased in all areas that have not been affected by disasters. However, with the change of production relations, there are many problems in the production management, income distribution, property handling, "Five Guarantees" policy, as well as procurement, supply, and market prices of agricultural cooperatives that need to be resolved. After these cadres go to the grassroots level, they will strengthen the leadership in various counties, increase the provincial leadership's understanding of the situation below, and overcome subjectivism and bureaucratism in their work. In order to complete the tasks assigned by the Provincial Party Committee, these cadres are determined to spend more time going deep into the lower levels to get close to the masses under the leadership of the local Party Committee, solicit opinions from the masses through discussions, visits, and investigations, reflect the problems at the grassroots level and among the masses, and summarize the experiences in the work in a timely manner to promote the work. They all expressed that they will share weal and woe with the cadres and masses below, learn from the local cadres and masses with a very humble attitude, respect the local cadres, and be good advisors and assistants.

    In addition, 49 cadres at the level of section chief and above have been transferred to factories to help with work. (Li Pu)

    中共河北省委抽调一批负责干部
    参加各县实际领导工作
    本报讯　中共河北省委最近从省级机关抽调了二百四十八名处长以上的干部到农村帮助工作，其中包括部、厅、局长级干部四十四人，处长级干部二百零四人。省委委员兼宣传部长朱子强同志已决定到定县；省农业厅副厅长孙克川、刘振邦分别到安国、涞源；省气象局副局长李国庆去阜平。他们这次下去都担任实职，有的担任县委第二书记或副书记，有的担任县委委员。
    根据河北省当前农村形势，抽调这批政策水平较高、并有农村工作经验的干部到基层去帮助工作是有重大意义的。河北农村今年是高级合作化的第一年，工作已有一定成绩，凡不受灾的地区，生产都有提高。但是随着生产关系的改变，在农业社的生产管理、收益分配、财产处理、“五保”政策以及收购、供应、市场价格等方面都存在很多问题，需要解决。这些干部到基层后，将加强各县领导力量，并将增进省级领导机关对下情的了解，克服工作中的主观主义和官僚主义。为了完成省委所交给的任务，这些干部都决心在当地党委领导下，用更多的时间深入下层接近群众，以座谈、访问、调查研究等方法，征求群众意见，反映基层和群众当中的问题，并及时总结工作中的经验，来推动工作。他们都表示：要和下面干部群众同甘共苦，用十分虚心的态度，向当地的干部、群众学习，尊重当地干部，当好参谋和助手。
    另外还抽调了四十九名处长以上干部到工厂帮助工作。　（李朴）
