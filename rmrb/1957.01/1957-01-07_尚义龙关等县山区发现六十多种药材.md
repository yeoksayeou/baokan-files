    More than Sixty Kinds of Medicinal Herbs Discovered in the Mountainous Areas of Shangyi, Longguan, and Other Counties
    Many Chinese medicinal materials have been discovered in the mountainous areas of Zhuolu, Longguan, Xuanhua, and Shangyi counties in Zhangjiakou Prefecture, Hebei Province. These include: "Shengdi" and "Shashen" for tonifying qi and strengthening the heart, "Wangbuliu" for promoting lactation, "Yuliren" for moistening the intestines, "Zicao" for treating measles, and "Caowu" for dispelling wind, totaling more than sixty kinds. In particular, "Tianxianzi," a special medicine for relieving toothache that was previously reliant on imports, has also been discovered in Shangyi County.
    After testing by the local health departments, these medicinal materials have been proven to have good efficacy. Local agricultural cooperatives have organized members to go into the mountains to dig up medicinal materials and sell them to supply and marketing cooperatives. (Xiao)

    尚义龙关等县山区发现六十多种药材
    河北省张家口专区的涿鹿、龙关、宣化、尚义等县山区，发现了许多中药药材。计有：补气强心用的“生地”、“沙参”，下奶用的“王不留”，润肠用的“郁李仁”，治麻疹用的“紫草”，散风用的“草乌”等六十多种。特别是过去靠进口的熏牙痛的特效药“天仙子”，也在尚义县发现了。
    这些药材，经当地卫生部门化验后，证明药效良好。当地的农业社，已组织社员上山刨药材，并出售给供销合作社。　（萧）
