Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 13th. Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on the evening of the 12th regarding the illegal passage by the United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation of the United States, of a resolution on the Korean question. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will never recognize the United Nations General Assembly's resolution on the Korean question, which was unilaterally discussed and illegally passed without the participation of representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and in violation of the will of the Korean people.

The United States is attempting to continue using the United Nations to implement its policies for resolving the Korean issue. The series of resolutions on the Korean question manufactured according to the United States' aggressive intentions and passed under its manipulation can only continue to obstruct the resolution of the Korean issue.

The United States' attempt to use the United Nations General Assembly resolution to continue imposing on the Korean people the conditions that it once tried to impose on them by force and which failed will continue to be opposed by the Korean people.

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly clarified its position on resolving the Korean issue. The Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves. Under the current circumstances, it is first necessary to strictly abide by the armistice agreement, quickly take measures to transform the armistice into a solid peace, and all foreign troops should withdraw from Korea simultaneously. Regarding general elections in Korea, these must be genuine democratic elections conducted in accordance with the free will of the Korean people, without any foreign interference.

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea does not recognize the so-called "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea," which interferes in Korea's internal affairs as a tool of American imperialism's aggression, and firmly opposes its activities. In order to quickly resolve the Korean issue, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will work to establish political, economic, and cultural ties between North and South Korea, and to continue seeking ways to peaceful unification through consultation between political parties, social organizations, and individuals in North and South Korea; and once again emphasizes that in order to resolve the Korean issue, a conference of relevant countries should be convened as soon as possible.

    南日外务相就联大非法决议发表声明
    斥责美国阻挠解决朝鲜问题
    重申朝鲜问题必须由朝鲜人民自己解决
    新华社平壤13日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日在12日晚就联合国大会在美国的操纵下非法通过关于朝鲜问题的决议一事发表声明。声明全文如下：
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府决不承认在没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加的情况下，片面地进行讨论，违背朝鲜人民的意志，非法通过的联合国大会关于朝鲜问题的决议。
    美国企图继续利用联合国来实行它对解决朝鲜问题的政策。根据美国的侵略意图制造出来，并在美国的操纵下通过的联合国大会关于朝鲜问题的一系列的决议，只能继续阻挠朝鲜问题的解决。
    美国企图用联合国大会的决议来继续把曾经用武力来强加给朝鲜人民而遭到失败的那些条件强加给朝鲜人民，这种企图将继续遭到朝鲜人民的反对。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府已经多次阐明了它对于解决朝鲜问题的立场。朝鲜问题应该由朝鲜人民自己来解决。在目前的情况下，首先必须严格遵守停战协定，迅速采取措施把停战转变为巩固的和平，一切外国军队应该同时撤出朝鲜。就朝鲜的普选来说，这必须是在没有任何外国干涉的条件下本着朝鲜人民的自由意志来进行真正的民主选举。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府不承认作为美帝国主义的侵略工具干涉朝鲜内政的所谓“联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会”，并且坚决反对它的活动。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为了迅速解决朝鲜问题，将为建立南北朝鲜间的政治、经济和文化联系，为在南北朝鲜政党、社会团体和个别人士之间以协商的方法继续寻求和平统一的途径而努力；并且再一次强调：为了解决朝鲜问题，应该迅速召开有关国家会议。
