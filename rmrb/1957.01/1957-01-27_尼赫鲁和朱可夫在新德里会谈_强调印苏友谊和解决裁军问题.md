Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 26th: Marshal Zhukov, the Soviet Minister of Defense, paid a visit to Indian Prime Minister Nehru on the 25th. Zhukov and Nehru held talks for forty-five minutes.
　　Prime Minister Nehru hosted a luncheon for Marshal Zhukov at his official residence on the same day.
　　At the banquet, Zhukov said that the Soviet people are watching with great interest the progress made by the Indian people in building their new life, and they sincerely hope that India will achieve greater success in its economic and cultural development.
　　Zhukov said that the continued consolidation of friendly relations between major countries such as India, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China, as well as other peace-loving countries, will create favorable conditions for maintaining the peace and security of all peoples and for maintaining the independence of those countries that still need the support of peace-loving countries.
　　He said that this is particularly important today because those who oppose international peaceful coexistence are launching the Cold War again.
　　After recounting the significant efforts made by the Soviet government in reducing armaments, Zhukov said that the Soviet Union does not need war. The Soviet people need peace in order to achieve a higher standard of living.
　　Zhukov added that the Soviet people, in their efforts to strive for peace, are always aware that they have received the moral support of the Indian people and the Indian government, headed by the brave peace fighter Mr. Nehru.
　　Nehru said in his speech that the friendship between the Indian and Soviet peoples has a foundation to support it, so I am sure that this friendship will continue to develop.
　　Nehru said, "Marshal, you talked about peace. We have a traditional policy of peace. You must understand that we won our independence through peaceful means. We are determined to continue to implement this policy."
　　Nehru said, "You also talked about the issue of disarmament. This is an important and urgent issue at present. Effective measures must be taken to solve the disarmament issue. We fully understand that if a war breaks out, nuclear weapons may be used, which will bring great disasters to the whole world. I hope that we will be able to find a way to solve this problem, if not completely abandon war, at least stop using war to solve disputes."
　　Nehru also said, "I personally know that the Soviet people, like other peoples, are eagerly hoping for peace. At the same time, I am sure that if we act together with the people of other countries, we will overcome all the obstacles that exist on the road to peace."

    尼赫鲁和朱可夫在新德里会谈
    强调印苏友谊和解决裁军问题
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社新德里26日讯：苏联国防部长朱可夫元帅25日拜会了印度总理尼赫鲁。朱可夫同尼赫鲁会谈了四十五分钟。
    尼赫鲁总理在同一天中午在他的官邸设宴招待朱可夫元帅。
    朱可夫在宴会上说，苏联人民正以很大的兴趣注视着印度人民在建设他们的新生活方面所取得的进步，他们真诚地希望印度在它的经济和文化发展方面取得更大的成就。
    朱可夫说，像印度、苏联、中华人民共和国这样一些大国以及其他爱好和平国家之间的友好关系的继续巩固，将会为维护各国人民的和平和安全、为维护仍然需要爱好和平国家支持的那些国家的独立创造有利的条件。
    他说，这一点在今天说来特别显得重要，因为那些反对国际和平共处的人又在重新发动冷战了。
    朱可夫在追述了苏联政府在裁减军备方面所作的重大努力之后说，苏联不需要战争。苏联人民需要和平，以便达到更高的生活水平。
    朱可夫又说，苏联人民在他们为争取和平的努力中，始终意识到他们得到了印度人民和以勇敢的和平战士尼赫鲁先生为首的印度政府的道义上的支持。
    尼赫鲁在讲话中说，印度人民和苏联人民之间的友谊有着一种基础在支持，因此我确信，这种友谊将会继续发展。
    尼赫鲁说，元帅先生，你谈到了和平。我们有一个传统的和平政策。你一定了解，我们是通过和平的办法赢得独立的。我们决心继续贯彻这种政策。
    尼赫鲁说，你还谈到了裁军问题。这是目前一个重要而迫切的问题。必须采取有效的措施来解决裁军问题。我们完全懂得，如果发生战争的话，核子武器可能会被使用，这将会给全世界带来巨大的灾难。我希望，我们将能够找到解决这个问题的办法，如果不完全放弃战争，至少也要停止通过战争的办法来解决纠纷。
    尼赫鲁还说，我个人知道，苏联人民同其他人民一样是热切地希望和平的。同时，我确信，要是我们同其他国家的人民共同行事，我们将会克服在通向和平的道路上所存在的一切障碍。
