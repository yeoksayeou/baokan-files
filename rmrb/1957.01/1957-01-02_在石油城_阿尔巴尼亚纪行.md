    In the Oil City
    --An Albanian Travelogue
    Lin Li
    The sky began to rain.
    The car left the main road, following a small path, and sped towards the guesthouse of Stalin Oil City.
    The guesthouse was located on the top of a mountain, surrounded by dense woods. The building was in the standard Italian style, and the interior still retained its unique Italian features. It was comfortable and quiet here. The whole compound had only one guard and an old cleaning woman. Everything was quiet. If it weren't for the portraits of Marx and Lenin on the wall, you would have mistakenly thought you were in the home of an Italian nobleman!
    I was still taken aback by this strange silence when the door creaked open. It was the Party Secretary of Stalin Oil City, Hasan Hasani, and the Chairman of the Trade Union. They shook hands with me and exchanged greetings, asking about my well-being as warmly as relatives. But with a turn of their bodies, they started arguing with the poet Aleks Çaçi and the journalist Vasili Lali, who had accompanied me. They said that many people welcoming the Chinese guests were standing on both sides of the avenue, and that Young Pioneers were waiting to present flowers. They reproached us for taking the small path and making the masses wait there in vain for so long. Vasili Lali did not back down either, glaring with his big eyes and replying, "I couldn't let my guests get wet in the rain!"
    The translator told me about the argument between the two sides, so I called Vasili Lali aside and advised him not to be so rude to the Party leaders. Hasani immediately saw what I meant. Before the translator could translate the words, he hurriedly came over to explain, "We are all old friends, it doesn't matter what we say." He pointed to Aleks Çaçi and the Trade Union Chairman, saying that they were old comrades-in-arms, fighting as guerrillas in the same unit during the war. Aleks Çaçi had been to China. He added to Hasani's words, saying that Europeans like to use gestures when they speak, and their voices are loud, which looks like fighting to Easterners, but that is just their national habit. Aleks Çaçi's words caused a burst of laughter, and the argument ended.
    Everyone sat down and began to talk about the situation in the Oil City.
    Oil is the essence of Albania's economy, and it is all concentrated in Kuçovë. This place used to be a target of contention for imperialist countries and is now an important base for national industrialization. As early as 1875, invaders from Britain, France, Germany, and Italy came here to conduct geological surveys. In 1925, the British were the first to forcibly buy this land, followed by the French and Italians. The three robbers occupied one-thirteenth of the territory of Albania. By 1934, when oil was officially extracted, Italy squeezed out British and French capital and established the "Italian Kingdom" within the borders of Albania. The guesthouse we were staying in was where the highest rulers here lived. The Italians monopolized the oil extraction rights and also monopolized the technical secrets of oil extraction. Engineers and administrative staff were Italians, and heavy manual labor was left to Albanians. The Italians drilled one oil well after another, but there were no refining facilities. Until the early days of liberation, only crude oil was produced here, not finished products. Like all colonialists, the Italians sent the crude oil back to Italy, refined it into petroleum, and then came back to Albania to make money. For this despicable purpose, they built an 80-kilometer-long oil pipeline, allowing crude oil to flow from the oil wells all the way to the Adriatic coast. The oil pipeline was like a greedy poisonous snake, sucking the blood and sweat of the Albanian people day and night. ... Speaking of these things, people expressed great indignation. Therefore, when arranging my itinerary, the Party Secretary suggested that I first visit the oil refinery, because it was built by the Albanians themselves.
    Early the next morning, we went down the mountain. What appeared before my eyes were countless oil wells. Far and near, on the mountains and down the hills, there were oil derricks standing proudly everywhere. The roads the car passed sparkled with bright oil droplets. Occasionally, some puddles were also covered by colorful floating oil. I thought to myself: This is truly a world of oil!
    Climbing up a small slope, we arrived at the oil refinery.
    The director of the oil refinery, engineers, and the Party Branch Secretary were already waiting in front of the gate. When talking about the situation of the oil refinery, they all had an indescribable sense of pride and self-esteem, because it was a refinery they had built with their own hands. The plant now has one hundred and eighty employees and produces eight thousand tons of oil per month. A new refining furnace is under construction and is expected to be put into production in a short period. By 1960, it will be able to produce 18,000 tons of oil per month. The director was very satisfied with the continuous increase in oil production. But he was even happier that Albanians were producing it themselves. The director said that the oil refinery was built in 1946. At that time, because there were no engineering technicians of their own, the refining task had to be handed over to an Italian. However, that Italian, who was the director before and became the chief engineer after liberation, colluded with American spies and formulated an insidious plan to burn down the oil refinery and its auxiliary equipment. At this time, they dismissed the Italian and invited Soviet experts. At the same time, they sent their own children to study in the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. In recent years, the Oil City has cultivated its own technical force. The workers in the oil refinery have also all been replaced by Albanians. They said that when the Italians had just left, many technical tasks fell on the shoulders of Soviet comrades. Now, the actual production is in the hands of Albanians. Soviet comrades only come to guide when problems arise. The director himself had just returned from studying in the Soviet Union.
    "In addition to producing oil, we also produce asphalt. Now, let's take a look at our asphalt!" The director said as he led me to the asphalt workshop. His tone of "we," "we" immediately reminded me of Pyongyang using Albanian asphalt to pave its roads. I said, "In China, I have already heard that Korea is using your asphalt to rebuild Pyongyang's main roads."
    As soon as these words came out, the director, engineers, and the Party Branch Secretary all gathered around me. They grabbed my hands and shook them again and again.... They said that Albanian asphalt had paved the roads of Paris, Rome, and Berlin, and the roads of many European countries that called themselves "civilized countries." But the asphalt they used was all stolen in a robber-like way. Only the asphalt used to rebuild the roads of Pyongyang this time was automatically donated by the Albanian people.
      "In the socialist family, it is an honor and happiness for the Albanian people to contribute a little, especially to be able to help the brotherly countries of the East with the fruits of our labor." When the director said these words, his eyes were filled with tears of excitement.
    Coming out of the oil refinery, we walked to the operating panel of a group of derricks. Here, there was a wooden disc supporting fifty-two steel ropes, which pulled the pumping units of fifty-two oil wells. Next to the disc was a small house with a hoisting machine inside. Managing these fifty-two wells was a technician and an ordinary worker. They said that this method of managing oil wells only came about after liberation. In the past, it was all manual labor. Eight people were on each well, like old oxen pulling a millstone. Now, only two people manage the oil wells that four hundred and sixteen people used to manage. The oil wells in this area are called old wells because two new oil fields have been discovered and new oil wells have been built in Batus and Zelik. The old oil wells were excavated during the Italian era, and they are not deep enough, and their distribution is not reasonable. Now, an oil well can only produce oil for three hours a day, for a total of only 0.8 tons. The new wells that have been built are being drilled according to the most advanced socialist standards. Therefore, the oil production time is quite long. An oil well produces oil for fifteen hours a day, totaling fifteen tons. They invited me to visit the new wells, but I couldn't make it because of lack of time.
    The Oil City has a very good power plant, which uses the oil it produces itself as fuel instead of coal. The people at the power plant said that there was also a power plant here during the Italian rule, but the machines and buildings were destroyed by American planes at the end of the anti-fascist war. What was left was completely destroyed by the German fascists before they retreated. When it was first liberated, this place was a ruin, a pile of rubble. The imperialists asserted that Albania would never be able to repair such a project. They also said that Albania would not be able to repair the power plant of the Oil City, and therefore it would not be able to start the production of oil, because it was the heart of the Oil City. The heroic Albanian working class did not bow their heads in the face of difficulties. They tightened their belts, endured poverty and hunger, and responded to the cries of the imperialists with glorious voluntary labor. Immediately afterwards, brand new power generation equipment was sent by the brother country of Czechoslovakia, and a full team of engineers and technicians was also sent. With a lofty spirit of internationalism, Czechoslovak comrades built this new power plant for the Oil City and taught the Albanians how to manage the generators. Now, all the people managing the power plant are Albanians. There is only one Czechoslovak who remains here. When people introduced me to that Czechoslovak comrade, the first thing I heard was: "My task here has been completed. The power plant can be managed by Albanian comrades themselves. My country has decided to let me return home and told me that my next post is to go to China." Hearing his words, I quickly extended a warm hand, and at the time of parting we said to each other: "See you in China."
    I stayed in the Oil City for two days. The two-day visit made me feel that the Albanian people are now advancing along the road of industrialization and are rapidly changing the backward face of their motherland. (Attached photo)

    在石油城
    ——阿尔巴尼亚纪行
    林里
    天空下起了雨。
    汽车离开大路，顺着一条小道，直朝斯大林石油城的招待所飞奔。
    招待所座落在山顶上，四周是密密的树林。房屋建筑是意大利的标准样式，内部的陈设仍残存着意大利的独特风格。这儿舒适而恬静。全院只有一个卫兵，一个看门老妇，一切都是静悄悄的。要不是墙壁上有马克思和列宁的挂像，你还会误以为置身在意大利贵族的家里呢！
    我正为这种奇异的静寂所惊骇，房门吱呀一声开了。进来的是斯大林石油城的党委书记哈山·哈山尼和工会主席。他们跟我握手寒暄，像亲人那样热情地问长问短。可是侧身一转，竟同陪我前来的诗人阿列克斯·恰奇、记者华西里·拉力吵起来了。他们说，大道两旁站着许多欢迎中国客人的人，还有少年先锋队员等着献花。他们责备我们不该绕道走小路，不该让群众站在那里白白等半天。华西里·拉力也不示弱，瞪着两只大眼回答说：“我不能让我的客人淋雨呵！”
    翻译把两方面的争吵说给我听，我便把华西里·拉力叫到一边，劝他不要对党的负责人这样不客气。哈山尼一下看透了我的用意，他不等翻译把话翻过去，就急忙过来解释说：“我们都是老朋友，说什么也没关系。”他指着阿列克斯·恰奇和工会主席说，他俩是老战友，战争期间在一个部队打游击。阿列克斯·恰奇到过中国，他补充哈山尼的话说，欧洲人说话喜欢动手势，声音又大，东方人看来就像打架似的，其实这就是他们的民族习惯。阿列克斯·恰奇的话引起一阵哄笑，争吵也就结束了。
    大家坐下来，开始叙述石油城的情况。
    石油是阿尔巴尼亚经济的精华，又全都集中在库乔瓦。这个地方过去是帝国主义国家争夺的目标之一，如今是国家工业化的重要基地。早在1875年间，英法德意等国的侵略者，就到这里进行过地质调查。1925年间，英国人首先强买了这块土地，接着来的是法国和意大利。三个强盗占了相当于阿尔巴尼亚领土的十三分之一。到正式采油的1934年，意大利挤走了英法资本，建立了阿尔巴尼亚国境以内的“意大利王国”。我们住的招待所，就是当年这里的最高统治者住的地方。意大利人霸占了这里的采油权利，也垄断了开采石油的技术秘密。工程技术人员和行政管理人员由意大利人充当，笨重的体力劳动就叫阿尔巴尼亚人去干。意大利人开凿了一个又一个的油井，但没有炼油设备。直到解放初期，这里还是只出原油，不出成品。意大利人像所有殖民主义者一样：把原油送回意大利，炼成石油，再到阿尔巴尼亚来赚钱。为了这个卑鄙的目的，他们修了一条长达八十公里的输油管，让原油从油井一直流到亚得里亚海边。输油管像一条贪得无厌的毒蛇，日日夜夜地吸食着阿尔巴尼亚人的血和汗。……说起这些，人们表示十分愤慨。因此，在安排我的行程时，党委书记建议我首先去看炼油厂。因为那是阿尔巴尼亚人自己建设的。
    第二天一早，我们下了山。眼前出现的是数不清的油井。远远近近，山上山下，到处都是傲然矗立的井架。汽车走过的大道两旁，闪耀着亮晶晶的油珠。偶而看见一些水洼洼，也被五彩斑斓的浮油所掩盖。我心里想：这真是油的世界呵！
    爬上一道小坡，我们来到了炼油厂。
    炼油厂的厂长、工程师和党支部书记，早已等候在门前。说起炼油厂的情况，他们都有一种难以形容的骄傲和自豪。因为这是他们亲手建设起来的炼油厂。全厂现有一百八十名职工，月产石油八千吨。这里正在建设一个新的炼油炉，预计短时期可以投入生产。到1960年，就可以月产石油一万八千吨。厂长对于石油产量的不断增加深为满意。但他更高兴的是阿尔巴尼亚人自己在生产。厂长说，炼油厂是1946年建成的。那时因为没有自己的工程技术人员，炼油任务不能不交给一位意大利人来负责。但是，那个从前是厂长，解放后做了总工程师的意大利人，竟同美国特务勾结在一起，拟定了烧毁炼油厂及其附属设备的阴险计划。这时，他们才解除了这个意大利人的职务，请来了苏联专家。同时，也派遣自己的子弟，到苏联和人民民主国家去学习。这几年来，石油城培养了自己的技术力量。炼油厂的工人也全都换成了阿尔巴尼亚人。他们说，意大利人才走时，许多技术工作都落在苏联同志的身上。现在，掌握实际生产的是阿尔巴尼亚人，苏联同志只在出了问题的时候才来指导指导。厂长自己，就是刚从苏联学习回来的。
    “除了生产石油以外，我们还生产沥青。现在，就看看我们的沥青吧！”厂长一面说，一面带我到了沥青车间。他那“我们”“我们”的语气，使我一下想起了平壤在用阿尔巴尼亚沥青铺马路的事。我说：“在中国，我就已听到朝鲜在用你们的沥青重建平壤大马路的消息。”
    这句话一出口，厂长、工程师和党支部书记，就一齐向我围拢来。他们拉住我的手，握了又握……。他们说，阿尔巴尼亚的沥青，铺过巴黎的马路，铺过罗马和柏林的马路，铺过欧洲许多自称“文明之国”的马路。但他们所用的沥青，都是用强盗般的方式偷走的。只有这次重建平壤马路的沥青，是阿尔巴尼亚人自动赠送的。
      “在社会主义大家庭中，阿尔巴尼亚人能贡献一点力量，特别是能以自己的劳动成果帮助东方的兄弟国家，是我们感到光荣和幸福的事。”厂长在说这些话的时候，眼眶里含着激动的泪。
    从炼油厂出来，我们走到一组井架的操作器前。这里有一个木质圆盘，支撑着五十二根钢绳，牵动着五十二眼油井的抽油机。圆盘旁边有一座小屋，里面安着卷扬机。管理这五十二眼井的是一个技术员，一个普通工人。他们说，这种管理油井的方法，是解放后才有的。从前都是体力劳动。每眼井上八个人，像老牛拉磨盘一样。现在只有两个人，就管理了过去四百一十六个人才能管理的油井。这一带的油井，人们叫做旧井，因为在巴都斯和泽里克地方，已经发现了两个新油田，并建设了新油井。旧油井都是意大利经营时期开挖的，深度不够，分布也不合理；现在一眼井一天只能出油三小时，总共不过零点八吨重。现在建设起来的新井，是按最先进的社会主义的标准开凿的。因此出油时间相当长。一眼井一天出油十五小时，合十五吨。他们邀我到新井去参观，但因时间不够，未能如愿。
    石油城有一个很不错的发电厂，所用的燃料不是煤，而是自己出产的石油。发电厂的人们说，在意大利统治时期，这里也有过一个发电厂，但在反法西斯战争末期，机器、厂房都被美国飞机炸毁了。剩下的一些东西，又被德国法西斯在撤退前全部破坏了。刚解放时，这里是一片废墟、一堆瓦砾。帝国主义者断言：这样的工程，阿尔巴尼亚永远也修不起。还说，阿尔巴尼亚修不起石油城的发电厂，也就不能开始石油的生产，因为它是石油城的心脏。英勇的阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级，没有在困难前面低头，他们束紧腰带，忍着贫困和饥饿，以光荣的义务劳动，回答了帝国主义者的叫嚷。紧接着，就由兄弟国家捷克斯洛伐克送来了全新的发电设备，又派来了全班的工程技术人员。捷克斯洛伐克同志以崇高的国际主义精神，为石油城建设了这座新型发电厂，又教会了阿尔巴尼亚人管理发电机的本领。现在，管理发电厂的已全是阿尔巴尼亚人了，留在这里的捷克斯洛伐克人只有一个。当人们介绍我同那位捷克斯洛伐克同志见面时，我听到的第一句话是：“我在这里的任务已经完成了，发电厂可以由阿尔巴尼亚的同志自己管理了。我的国家已决定让我回国，并且告诉我说：我的下一个岗位是去中国。”听了他的话，我急忙伸出热情的手，临别时还相互说了一句：“中国再见。”
    我在石油城住了两天。两天的访问使我感到，阿尔巴尼亚人民今天正在沿着工业化的道路前进，正在迅速地改变自己祖国的落后面貌。（附图片）
    这是在苏联帮助下在萨别克兴建的巨大炼油厂，现已开工生产。今年就能精炼国内的全部原油。　　（新华社稿）
