    Too Many Book and Magazine Introduction Booklets
    Many publishing houses publish a lot of booklets introducing books and magazines. For example, the Popular Reading Materials Publishing House publishes 60,600 copies of "Introduction to Popular Books and Periodicals," the Shanghai New Knowledge Publishing House publishes 44,100 copies of "Book and Magazine Introduction," the People's Literature Publishing House publishes 40,000 copies of "Book and Magazine Introduction," and the New Literature and Art Publishing House publishes 57,700 copies of "Introduction to Literature and Art Books and Periodicals." In addition, China Youth Publishing House, Basic Construction Publishing House, Times Publishing House, People's Railway Publishing House, etc., all have their own published book and magazine introduction booklets. These booklets are not only printed in large quantities, but are also very elaborate. Some have three-color covers, and generally use woodfree printing paper, in two colors. These booklets use 40-50 reams of paper per issue, and at least 10-20 reams of paper. Each issue costs 1,000-2,000 yuan. This not only increases the cost of the publishing house, but also raises the price of books. We hope that the publishing department can quickly change this wasteful phenomenon. Liu Yi

### 书刊介绍小册子太多

    书刊介绍小册子太多
    许多出版社都出版很多书刊介绍的小册子。如通俗读物出版社出版的“通俗书刊介绍”印数是六万零六百册，上海新知识出版社出版的“书刊介绍”印数是四万四千一百册，人民文学出版社出版的“书刊介绍”印数是四万册，新文艺出版社出版的“文艺书刊介绍”印数是五万七千七百册，此外中国青年出版社、基本建设出版社、时代出版社、人民铁道出版社等都有自己出版的书刊介绍小册子。这些小册子，不仅印刷数量很大，而且还很讲究，有的封皮三种颜色，一般是用道林纸，两种颜色。这些小册子多的每期要用四、五十令纸，最少的也要一、二十令纸，每期要花费一、两千元。这不但加重了出版社的成本，而且提高了书价。我们希望出版部门能够很快改变这种浪费现象。　柳　毅
