Xinhua News Agency, London, January 23rd: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd spoke extensively on the Middle East issue on the 22nd at a meeting of a Conservative Party organization called the "National Liberal Forum." This was Lloyd's first speech since being reappointed as Foreign Secretary. He said that in the Middle East, the United Nations and "our friends in the United States" "have to some extent taken matters out of our hands." He stated that Britain will "follow with concern" how the United States and the United Nations will fulfill their "heavy responsibilities undertaken in the Middle East" in the future.

At the same time, Lloyd stated that in the Middle East, Britain remains determined to do what it can. He emphasized that the Middle East cannot be allowed to return to the situation before the outbreak of the invasion of Egypt. He advocated that the Western world should make every effort to resolve some problems, including the "free passage" of the Suez Canal and the Gulf of Aqaba, and "some kind of international solution for the Gaza Strip, no country has the right to claim national sovereignty there," and so on.

Lloyd said that some people say that British influence in this region has collapsed. People who say this completely disregard the fact that Western influence in some countries has been constantly weakening for a long time.

When talking about British-American relations, Lloyd said that he "believes in the British-American alliance and friendship," and Britain will "try to coordinate" the policies and actions of Britain and the United States to the "greatest possible extent." At the same time, he said that at the recent NATO conference, Dulles had stated that the U.S. government reserves the right to take independent action in some areas. Lloyd said, "We must reserve the same right for ourselves." He recalled that British Prime Minister Macmillan had said that Britain is "not" a "vassal state" of the United States. He continued: "We believe that we will have our own contribution."

    劳埃德重申英国不是美国的附庸国
    说英国“关切地注意”美国在中东的行动
    据新华社23日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交大臣劳埃德22日在一个名为“国民自由讨论会”的保守党组织的会议上，着重谈到中东问题。这是劳埃德在他重新被任命为外交大臣后第一次发表演说。他说，在中东，联合国和“我们在美国的朋友”“在某种程度上已经使事情脱离了我们的掌握”，他表示，英国将“关切地注意”美国和联合国今后将怎样履行它们“在中东所担负的沉重的责任”。
    劳埃德同时表示，在中东，英国仍然决心做它能做的事。他强调不能允许中东回到侵埃战争爆发前的局面。他主张西方世界要全力来解决一些问题，包括苏伊士运河和亚喀巴湾“自由通航”问题，“对加沙地带作某种国际性的解决，任何国家都无权要求在该地享有国家主权”等。
    劳埃德说，有人说英国势力在这个地区崩溃了。说这种话的人完全不顾这个事实：西方势力在某些国家早就不断地在削弱。
    劳埃德在谈到英美关系的时候说，他是“相信英美联盟和友谊”的，英国将“尝试来协调”英美两国的政策和行动到“最大可能限度”。同时他说，在最近举行的北大西洋公约会议上，杜勒斯曾表明美国政府保留在某些方面采取独立行动的权利。劳埃德说，“我们必须为我们自己保留同样权利。”他追述，英国首相麦克米伦曾说英国“不是”美国的“附庸国”。他接着说：“我们相信，我们将有我们自己的贡献。”
