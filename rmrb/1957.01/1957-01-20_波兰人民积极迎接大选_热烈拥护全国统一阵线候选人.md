Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 19th: (Our Correspondent Xie Wenqing) The election campaign for the Polish Parliament has reached its final stage. The people across the country are more actively involved in this movement. Among the eighteen million voters (an increase of one and a half million compared to the last parliamentary election) in the one hundred and sixteen constituencies across the country, 80% have personally gone to the polling stations to check their names. In some places, the number of voters checking their names has reached 90%. Candidate meetings with voters will continue to be held in various locations. An increasing number of voters are participating in various rallies of the election campaign.

Currently, in every corner of cities such as Warsaw, Krakow, and Wroclaw, one can see posters and slogans calling for the election of candidates from the National Unity Front. Radio cars in major cities and loudspeakers in streets and alleys are emitting loud calls, urging the people to vote for freedom, prosperity, and peace. National newspapers are explaining to the people the tremendous achievements of Poland's socialist construction over the past twelve years, publicizing the Polish United Workers' Party's leadership's many measures to correct errors, deviations, and improve various tasks, and calling on the people to support the Party's leadership and the National Unity Front. Members of the Polish United Workers' Party are also conducting extensive publicity activities among the masses.

In recent days, trade unions, cooperatives, various social organizations, and urban and rural residents in various places have been holding meetings. These meetings have passed resolutions and declarations, calling on people to unite and participate in the election, and not to cross out the name of any candidate on the National Unity Front candidate list. "Vote for the National Unity Front candidates!" This is the common cry of the people throughout Poland. The broad masses of voters see that only the party of the working class can correct the mistakes of the past, and can lead the people to build an independent, free, and happy socialist Poland. Comrade Gomulka's words—"Our difficulties are difficulties in progress," "Do not cross out a single candidate"—have received the full support of the people.

With the broad masses already mobilized, the reactionary elements' conspiracies to provoke and incite, oppose the Polish United Workers' Party, oppose socialism, and sabotage the election have been exposed by the people. At a workers' meeting in the Bobrek coal mine, the miners warned those bad elements, saying: We will never allow the scoundrels to carry out activities against the party of the working class. Workers and students in many places have organized pickets to protect polling stations in order to prevent any sabotage. The Polish United Workers' Party has already imposed disciplinary sanctions on individual party members who sneaked into the party and engaged in anti-party activities during the election campaign.

    波兰人民积极迎接大选
    热烈拥护全国统一阵线候选人
    新华社华沙19日电　本社记者谢文清报道：波兰议会的选举运动已经到了最后阶段。全国人民更加积极地投入这个运动中。在全国一百一十六个选区的一千八百万选民（比上次议会选举时增加了一百五十万人）当中，已经有80％的人亲自到选举站去查对自己的姓名。在有些地方，查对姓名的选民达到了90％。候选人同选民的会见会继续在各地举行。参加选举运动各种集会的选民更加增多了。
    目前，在华沙、克拉科夫、弗罗茨瓦夫等城市的每个角落，都可以看到号召选举全国统一阵线候选人的招贴画和标语。各大城市的广播汽车和街头巷尾的扩音器都在发出响亮的号召，呼吁人民为自由、繁荣和和平而投票。全国的报刊都在向人民说明十二年来波兰社会主义建设的巨大成就，宣传波兰统一工人党的领导关于纠正错误、偏差和改进各项工作的许多措施，并且号召人民拥护党的领导，拥护全国统一阵线。波兰统一工人党的党员也在人民群众中进行着广泛的宣传活动。
    这些天来，工会、合作社、各种社会团体、各地城乡居民，都在纷纷举行会议。这些会议通过了决议、宣言，号召人们团结一致参加选举，并且不要划掉全国统一阵线候选人名单上任何一个候选人的名字。“投全国统一阵线候选人的票！”这是波兰各地人民的共同呼声。广大选民们看到，只有工人阶级的政党，才能纠正过去时期的错误，才能领导人民建立独立、自由、幸福的社会主义的波兰。哥穆尔卡同志所说的话——“我们的困难是前进中的困难”、“不要划掉一个候选人”，已经得到人民的充分支持。
    在广大群众已经发动起来的情况下，反动分子挑拨煽动、反对波兰统一工人党、反对社会主义、破坏选举的阴谋，已经被人民所揭穿。在伯布莱克煤矿的工人集会上，矿工们警告那些坏分子说：我们决不容许坏蛋进行反对工人阶级政党的活动。许多地方的工人和学生们组织了纠察队来保护选举站，以防止任何捣乱事件。波兰统一工人党对于个别混进党内、在选举运动中进行反党活动的党员已经给予纪律制裁。
