    The Logistics Department of the PLA Unit Stationed in Kunming Saves a Large Amount of State Assets

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Logistics Department of the PLA Unit Stationed in Kunming has saved a large amount of state assets.

    In military supply work, the department conscientiously implemented various systems, recovered a large number of discarded and old bedding items, and properly processed them, with a value of 106,000 yuan. At the same time, they used these discarded and old items to make a large number of mattresses, which were distributed to the troops. Many shoemakers were also trained among the soldiers to repair shoes for officers and soldiers, saving expenses for the country. The officers and soldiers of a certain automobile regiment, under the premise of safely and promptly completing transportation tasks, put forward the slogan "Cherish every drop of oil, every piece of equipment." Maintenance personnel have repaired dozens of types of discarded equipment over the past year, saving more than 25,000 yuan and solving the difficulty of insufficient supply of certain equipment.

    The officers and soldiers not only saved in large aspects but also paid attention to saving in small details. Comrades in the health department collected scattered broken glass piece by piece, collecting more than 500 kilograms in total, which could be exchanged for 2,500 small medicine bottles.

    驻昆明部队后勤部为国家节约大批资财
    本报讯　驻昆明部队后勤部为国家节约了大批资财。
    在军需工作中，该部认真执行各种制度，收回了大批废旧被装，并适当地进行了处理，价值达十万六千元；同时用这些废旧品制作了大量的褥子，发给了部队。在战士中还培养了许多鞋工，为官兵们修理鞋子，为国家节省了开支。汽车某团的官兵们，在安全、及时完成运输任务的前提下，提出“爱护每一滴油，每一件器材”的口号，保养人员一年来修复几十种废旧器材，不但节约了两万五千多元，而且解决了某些器材供应不足的困难。
    广大官兵们不仅从大的方面节约，也注意从细小地方节约。卫生部门的同志们，把丢散的碎玻璃一点一点收拾起来，共收集了五百多公斤，可以换回二千五百只小药瓶。
