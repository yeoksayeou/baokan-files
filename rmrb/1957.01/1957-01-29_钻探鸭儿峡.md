    Drilling in Ya'erxia
    Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, January 28th: The Yumen Mining Bureau has begun large-scale drilling in Ya'erxia, and the second deep exploration well has recently started drilling.
    According to the preliminary drilling plan formulated by Yumen Oil Mine, dozens of oil exploration wells will be drilled in the Ya'erxia area. According to the well locations arranged for the first batch of exploration wells, the drilling area is approximately equal to the current area of the Laojunmiao Oilfield in Yumen Oil Mine. After the second batch of exploration wells is started, it will greatly exceed the area of the Laojunmiao Oilfield. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the oil-bearing area of Ya'erxia will be basically explored.
    Ya'erxia is located in the Jiuquan Basin and is a newly developed oil exploration area in Yumen Oil Mine. At the end of May last year, drilling workers began drilling the first deep exploration well here. By December 18th of the same year, this well gushed a large amount of crude oil from the underground, which was more than five li deep. The person in charge of the geological department of Yumen Mining Bureau said: According to the data obtained from electrical measurements, radioactive logging and other methods on this well, it has been preliminarily confirmed that the Ya'erxia area is an excellent new oil reservoir with industrial value.

    钻探鸭儿峡
    据新华社玉门28日电　玉门矿务局开始大规模钻探鸭儿峡，第二口深探井已经在最近开钻。
    根据玉门油矿制定的初步钻探计划，将在鸭儿峡地区钻凿几十口石油探井。按照第一批探井布置的井位计算，钻探面积约等于玉门油矿老君庙油田现在的面积，第二批探井开钻以后，将大大超过老君庙油田的面积。预计到今年年底将基本上探明鸭儿峡的储油面积。
    鸭儿峡位于酒泉盆地，是玉门油矿新开辟的一个石油探区。去年5月底，钻井工人在这里开始钻第一口深探井，到同年12月18日，这口井从深达五华里多的地下大量喷出了原油。玉门矿务局地质部门负责人谈：根据这口井经过电测、放射性测井和其他方法取得的资料，已经初步证实鸭儿峡地区是一个优良的、有工业价值的新油藏。
