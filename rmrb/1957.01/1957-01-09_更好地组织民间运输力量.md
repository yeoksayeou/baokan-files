    Better Organize Civilian Transportation Forces
    Ke Yuelin

    Animal-drawn carts, rickshaws, and other forms of civilian transportation handle more than half of the total road freight volume. Especially in the current situation of tight road transport, it is a social transport force that can be fully utilized. Although some work has been done in various places to organize civilian transportation forces in recent times, there are still many problems.

    First, the issue of freight rates. Whether the freight rate is reasonable has great practical significance for mobilizing civilian transportation forces to participate in transportation. According to the information reflected at the dispatch station meeting recently held in Beijing by the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, the freight rates set for civilian transportation forces in some areas are somewhat low, and the income of farmers participating in transportation is not as high as their income in agricultural cooperatives. There are also no reasonable subsidies for long-distance empty trips. For example, the Dali Special Zone in Yunnan Province once stipulated that each horse would only be paid 1.8 yuan for transporting 100 jin per 100 li, with no subsidies for empty trips, resulting in losses for most mule caravans.

    Second, the fees charged to civilian transportation forces are too numerous and too high. There are many items, such as handling fees, license taxes, road maintenance fees, etc. Some farmers say that transportation companies are "squeezing companies." Various fee rates are too high. For example, the business handling fee charged by the transportation department of Heilongjiang Province is as high as 6% of the freight revenue, and some provinces even regard this revenue as a financial task to be turned over, obtaining profits from it. These all reduce the actual income of transportation households.

    Third, the farmers participating in transportation are not well taken care of, and they feel that there are many unresolved difficulties in terms of food, accommodation, and livestock feed supply. Farmers participating in transportation eat more due to the high intensity of labor and require to buy more rice. Although the provincial grain bureau in some places agreed, the grain bureau in some counties disagreed. The inns in townships and market towns are small and expensive, and farmers cannot afford to live in them, so some sleep in the open. These all add a lot of trouble to the farmers participating in transportation.

    Due to the above reasons, the enthusiasm of farmers to participate in transportation has been damaged to a certain extent. According to statistics from the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, the proportion of freight volume transported by civilian vehicles participating in transportation in 1956 in the total road freight volume has decreased compared with 1955.

    Why can't these problems be solved well? The main reason is that many transportation management departments underestimate civilian transportation forces. They always believe that civilian transportation tools are scattered and backward, and are not the direction of development, so they have relaxed leadership and management, and sometimes even give various unreasonable restrictions. These ideas are obviously divorced from reality. We have very, very few cars. Although the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has been built, it is impossible to supply a large number of cars to the road transportation department in the short term; even if there are many, many cars, the state cannot build so many roads to connect every county and township. Therefore, civilian transportation forces are still indispensable for a considerable period of time in the future.

    In order to mobilize civilian transportation forces to participate in transportation, it is necessary to care about the actual income of farmers participating in transportation and the difficulties in their lives. Henan Province has adopted a more flexible method in collecting road maintenance fees. It stipulates that rubber-tired carts that participate in transportation for no more than three months a year are exempt from road maintenance fees, which is welcomed by farmers. The transportation department of Liaoning Province found big cart inns for cart drivers, helped them rent civilian houses and courtyards, or contacted cargo owners to build temporary sheds, and organized them to concentrate on meals, and sent people to buy forage from other places, or hired people to cut grass to supply livestock feed. This has played a great role in encouraging farmers to participate in transportation.

    Of course, there are also some practical difficulties in organizing civilian transportation tools. Many civilian transportation tools are agricultural sideline vehicles, which mainly serve agricultural production. Especially during the busy farming season, the contradiction between transportation and cultivation is more prominent. This requires transportation management departments to do more detailed and specific work to help agricultural cooperatives reasonably arrange animal power and extract vehicles to participate in transportation as much as possible without affecting agricultural production.

### 更好地组织民间运输力量

    更好地组织民间运输力量
    柯月霖
    马车、人力车等民间运输力量担负着公路运输半数以上的运量。特别是在目前公路运输很紧张的情形下，它是一支可以充分利用的社会运输力量。最近一个时期各地对于组织民间运输力量虽然已经做了一些工作，但是存在的问题还不少。
    一是运价问题。运价是不是合理，对动员民间运输力量参加运输有很大的实际意义。根据交通部公路总局最近在北京召开的调度站务会议反映，目前有些地区对民间运输力量的运价订得低了些，农民参加运输的收入不如在农业社里的收入多。对于长途放空也没有规定合理的补贴。例如云南大理专区曾经规定每匹马百里百斤只付运费一元八角，放空不给补贴，造成多数马帮亏损。
    二是对民间运输力量征收的费用偏多、偏高。多是名目繁多，如手续费、牌照税、养路费等等，有些农民就说运输公司是“抽头公司”。各种费率过高，如黑龙江省运输部门征收的业务手续费竟高达运费收入的6％，有些省甚至把这项收入当作财政上缴任务，从中获取利润。这些都降低了运输户的实际收入。
    三是对参加运输的农民照顾不周，他们在食、宿、牲畜草料供应等方面，都感到有不少困难没法解决。参加运输的农民因劳动强度大，吃的多，要求多买一些米，尽管有些地方的省粮食厅同意了，有些县的粮食局却不同意。乡场、集镇的客栈地方小、价钱贵、农民住不起，有的就露宿。这些，都给参加运输的农民增添了不少麻烦。
    由于上面这些原因，在一定程度上伤害了农民参加运输的积极性。根据交通部公路总局的统计，1956年参加运输的民间车辆的运量，在公路总运量中所占的比重已较1955年下降。
    为什么上述这些问题不能很好地解决呢？主要是因为不少运输管理部门轻视民间运输力量。他们总认为民间运输工具分散、落后，不是发展方向，就放松了领导和管理，有时甚至给予种种不合理的限制。这些想法显然是脱离实际的。我们已有的汽车是很少很少的，第一汽车制造厂虽然已经建成了，但短期内还不可能把大量的汽车供给公路运输部门；即使有了很多很多的汽车，国家也不可能建设那么多的公路，把每一个县、乡都联系起来。因此，民间运输力量在今后相当长的时期里，还是不可缺少的。
    为了动员民间运输力量参加运输，必须关心参加运输的农民的实际收入和生活中的困难。河南省在征收养路费中，采取了比较灵活的办法，规定胶轮大车一年参加运输不超过三个月的，免收养路费，受到农民的欢迎。辽宁省运输部门为赶车农民找大车店，帮助他们租民房大院，或联系货主搭盖临时车棚，还组织他们集中办伙食，并派人到外地购买草料，或雇人割草，供应牲口饲料，这对鼓励农民参加运输起了很大的作用。
    当然，在组织民间运输工具的工作上，也有一些实际困难。民间运输工具很多是农业的副业车辆，它们主要是为农业生产服务的，特别是在农忙的时候，运输和耕作的矛盾表现得比较突出。这就需要运输管理部门多作些细致的具体工作，帮助农业社合理地安排畜力，在不影响农业生产的前提下，尽可能地抽出车辆参加运输。
