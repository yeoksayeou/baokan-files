Impressions of a Visit to India
Shi Liang, Head of the Chinese Women's Delegation to India

As I speak here about my impressions of visiting India, every member of our delegation seems still surrounded by the deep friendship of the Indian people. In a short three weeks, we visited the Indian capital, New Delhi, twice, and also stayed briefly in the following cities: Calcutta, Agra, Indore, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore, and Madras. In each city, whether at the airport or during visits, we were greeted by welcomers and responsible persons who presented us with various beautiful and fragrant garlands. It is especially difficult to describe the sincere friendship towards China that flowed from the dark, intelligent eyes of Indian men, women, and children. Our greetings consisted of putting our hands together and saying things like "Namaste (Hello), Shukriya (Thank you)," but these simple gestures made us feel immediately at home with our Indian friends. Our conversations and interactions increased mutual understanding.

The Chinese Women's Delegation was sent by our government at the invitation of the Indian government. Therefore, we were highly valued and warmly received everywhere we went. In the capital, New Delhi, we were received separately by President Prasad and Vice President Radhakrishnan. They both believed in the necessity of developing traditional friendship between China and India, and that more exchanges between Chinese and Indian women would be beneficial.

During the three weeks, we were accompanied on our visits by the Parliamentary Secretary of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, Mrs. Menon, President of the All India Women's Conference, Mrs. Nehru, wife of the Indian Ambassador to China, and other personnel. They took meticulous care of the delegation.

In New Delhi, we attended sessions in the Indian upper and lower houses and talked with female parliamentarians. There are twenty women among the two hundred and twenty members of the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) and eighteen women among the four hundred and ninety-nine members of the House of the People (Lok Sabha). It is said that after the Indian parliamentary elections, the number of female parliamentarians may increase.

A night's train ride from New Delhi brought us to the Nangal Dam and power plant in Punjab Province. In recent years, this area has developed from a desolate village into an industrial city with eight thousand workers, three hundred engineers, and a population of fifteen thousand. With hydroelectric equipment, primary and secondary schools have also been established. The workers' dormitories are neatly built, and families have set up maternal and child health stations. Even the electricity for New Delhi and nearby cities is supplied by this hydroelectric power plant.

We visited the Bhakra Dam, Nangal Dam, and power plant here. The Himalayas are already in sight. In the past, the water flowing from the mountains caused disasters, but during droughts, there was a severe lack of water. Therefore, the engineers here told us that their slogan is: "Challenge the Himalayas." They will transform famine-stricken areas into grain-producing areas. It is estimated that three years after completion, wheat will smile on ten million acres of land here.

In Madras, we visited the railway carriage factory, and in Bombay, we visited the dairy farm with fifteen thousand cows. These are places that Premier Zhou had visited. Premier Zhou praised the former as the pride of the East; for the latter, he believed that its modern equipment and management methods could serve as our example. Indeed, from these constructions, we can see the achievements of the Indian people in construction after independence.

In the suburbs of New Delhi and Bangalore, we visited two villages and observed social welfare work in the countryside, such as maternal and child health care, vocational training, and loans for seeds and farm tools. From government officials or the people, we often heard them talk about the importance of rural work.

We also visited medical research institutes, physics institutes, atomic energy agencies, agricultural and pastoral research institutions, and some hospitals. Everywhere we went, we heard scientists and engineering technicians proudly tell us, "This is what we Indians have built ourselves," or, "We took this over from the British in such-and-such year."

During our visits, the Indian people we met all expressed their friendship towards China and also believed that China's friendship towards India was sincere. For example, a farmer in the suburbs of New Delhi said: "The Chinese and Indian people are not only friends but also brothers. We hope you will come again, and again!" The cheers of "Hindi-Chini bhai bhai" and enthusiastic applause from the workers in the Calcutta textile factory seem to still resonate in our ears. Those young and old workers reached out their hands one by one, asking for a signature of a Chinese name they did not recognize.

As a women's delegation, the issues and work concerning Indian women naturally became the main focus of our visits. We saw many women's relief work units, whose work is often coordinated with the government's social welfare work. In a women's cooperative near Calcutta, the main purpose is to teach women hand weaving and literacy. Those young girls blew conch shells and lined up at the gate to welcome us, sprinkling golden flower petals on us. After we sat down, they put red and yellow auspicious marks on our foreheads and placed garlands of tuberose around our necks. Such solemn etiquette showed their feelings for their Chinese guests.

In six or seven cities, we were introduced to their hand weaving or various handicrafts. "Wearing what you make yourself" still carries the legacy of Gandhi's hard work and simplicity. In addition, these exquisite handicrafts are indeed the intelligent creations of the Indian people through the ages. Many drawings and textiles have no patterns; they are drawn and woven freely, but the finished products are very beautiful and have a high artistic level. Most of the women in these units are people who have suffered various misfortunes, but they are all extremely intelligent. According to one person in charge, the British imperialists once resented them, and some artisans had their fingers cut off because of their "ingenious workmanship."

Indian women's work is diverse: refugee relief, orphanage care, midwifery and various technical training, schools for poor children, maternal and child health, and caring for widows and orphans. In order to prevent India's population from increasing too quickly, overcome backwardness and poverty, and protect mothers and infants, India is vigorously promoting "family planning," mainly promoting contraception and guiding sexual life. When we left India in early January, the All India Family Planning Conference was being held in Calcutta. Social work is something that some educated Indian women are happy to engage in; they often do this work in addition to managing their homes.

The delegation attended the annual meeting of the All India Women's Conference in Indore, where we gave a congratulatory speech and presented a report on "The Work Chinese Women Are Doing." The conference discussed "expanding the scope of women's employment" and "the partial employment of married women." Because in India, family and employment have become a difficult issue for women to balance. Many highly educated women often marry and stay at home after graduation. A female university president said that the employment rate of students after graduation is not high, and the administrative side of the medical school even felt that it was a waste that the medical talents they cultivated could not "apply what they have learned," The Indian Vice President said that more and more Indian women are participating in work. The problem lies on the one hand in striving for it themselves, and on the other hand in solving the problems of housework and childcare.

Indian women are very concerned about how Chinese women balance work and family, and we answered their questions as much as possible.

The delegation was also warmly received by members of the India-China Friendship Association in New Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore, and Madras. At the grand reception in New Delhi, we were deeply moved by their singing and music. Three young men and women sang three songs heroically with the accompaniment of national instruments. Although we could only hear the phrase "Hindi-Chini bhai bhai," we still understood their hearts - friendship with China and affection for the Chinese people. At the reception in Bombay, we met the mother and sister of Dr. Kotnis, whose family members sacrificed their precious lives for the liberation of the Chinese people. We expressed our condolences and gratitude to them.

India is a country with vast land, abundant resources, and a long history, which we already knew. But during the three-week trip, we saw even more the beauty of the Indian people - not only the beauty of their features and the beauty of women's clothing, the beauty of national songs and dances, but also because they have great strength and appear even more beautiful. We see that the long-term colonial rule of British imperialism has not destroyed the superior traditions of the Indian people. Both China and India do not shy away from their own weakness and backwardness, and believe that they must work hard to overcome them in order to have a future. And it is very beneficial for China and India to increase delegation exchanges, cultural exchanges and friendly cooperation.

The friendship between the billion peace-loving Chinese and Indian people is guided by the Five Principles, and is becoming more consolidated and developed. The solidarity of the Chinese and Indian people will make greater contributions to peace in Asia and the world. After a three-week visit to India, we have strengthened this belief even more. Let us remotely wish India's prosperity and the happiness of its people! Let us work harder and harder for the solidarity of the Chinese and Indian people!

    访印观感
    中国妇女访印代表团团长　史良
    当我在这里讲访印观感的时候，我们代表团每个成员好像还被包围在印度人民浓郁的友情之中。在短短三星期中，我们两次访问印度首都新德里，也曾在以下各城小住：加尔各答、亚格拉、印度尔、孟买、班加罗尔、迈索尔、马德拉斯。在各城中，无论在机场或在参观访问中，我们都被欢迎者和接待的负责人戴上多种多样的美丽芬芳的花环，尤其是从印度男女老幼每人一双黑乌乌的聪明眼睛中流露出的对中国的诚笃友情，实难描绘。我们见面时的礼节不外双手合十，说些“那马斯得（你好）、舒克利亚（谢谢）”等话，但这些简单的表示，使我们同印度朋友真是一见如故。我们的交谈和接触，增进了相互间的了解。
    中国妇女代表团是应印度政府邀请，由我国政府派出的。因此所到各地，极受当地政府的重视，予以隆重接待；在首都新德里，并由总统普拉沙德及副总统拉达克里希南分别接见。他们都认为中印有发展传统友谊的必要，中印妇女间多多往还，更有好处。
    在三个星期中，陪同代表团参观的有印度外交部驻议会秘书、全印妇女会议主席梅农夫人、印度驻华大使拉·库·尼赫鲁的夫人以及其他人员。她们对代表团照料得无微不至。
    在新德里，我们曾到印度上下议院列席旁听，和女议员们交谈。联邦院二百二十名议员中有二十名妇女，人民院四百九十九名议员中有十八名妇女。据说，印度议院改选后，妇女议员名额还可能增加。
    从新德里乘一夜火车，就到达旁遮普省的南加尔水闸和发电厂。近年来，这里由一荒村发展成一个工业城市，有八千工人，三百工程师，居民一万五千人。有了水电设备，中小学也办起来了。工人宿舍盖得很整齐，家属们办起妇婴卫生站来。连新德里和附近城市的用电，也是这个水力发电厂供应的。
    我们在这儿参观了巴克拉水闸、南加尔水闸和发电厂。这里，喜马拉雅山已然在望，过去山上的水流到此地就造成灾害，缺水的时候却又干旱万分。因此，这里的工程师告诉我们，他们的口号是：“向喜马拉雅山挑战”。他们将使得粮荒地区变成产粮地区。估计完工以后三年，小麦就将在这里的一千万英亩土地上微笑了。
    我们在马德拉斯参观了火车车厢厂，在孟买参观了有一万五千头牛的牛奶场。这些都是周总理去过的地方。对前者，周总理曾誉为东方的骄傲；对后者，他认为它的现代化设备以及管理方法可以作为我们的榜样。的确，从以上这些建设中，我们可以看到印度人民在独立以后建设的成绩。
    在新德里近郊和班加罗尔近郊，我们访问了两个农村，参观了农村中的社会福利工作，如妇婴保健、训练副业技术、种子和农具的贷款等。从政府官员或人民口中，我们时常听到他们谈到农村工作的重要。
    我们还访问了医药研究所、物理研究所、原子能机构、农牧研究机构和一些医院。我们到处都听到一些科学家和工程技术人员自豪地对我们说：“这是我们印度人自己搞起来的”；或是，“从某年起，我们从英国人手中接了过来。”
    我们在参观访问过程中，所遇到的印度人民无不表示对中国的友好，而且也相信中国对印度的友好是真诚的。例如新德里近郊的一个农民说：“中印人民不仅是朋友，而且是兄弟，希望你们再来，再来！”加尔各答纺织厂里工人的“印地秦尼巴依巴依”的欢呼声和热烈的掌声，好像至今还缭绕在我们耳际。那些年轻的和年老的工人们一个个伸过手来，一个个要求签一个他们所不认得的中国名字。
    作为一个妇女代表团，印度的妇女问题和妇女工作自然成为我们参观访问的主要对象。我们看了不少妇女救济工作单位，她们的工作常和政府的社会福利工作配合。在加尔各答近郊的一个妇女合作社，主要是教养妇女们从事手工纺织和学文化。那些年轻的姑娘们吹着海螺在大门口排队欢迎我们，往我们身上洒金黄色的花瓣。等我们坐下来以后，她们又往我们每人眉心上点红黄色的吉祥痣，给我们每人颈上套了晚香玉结成的花环。一个有好歌喉的姑娘坐在地上唱了长长的欢迎歌。这样郑重的礼节，说明了她们对中国客人的心意。
    在六、七个城市，我们都被介绍去看她们的手纺织或各种手工艺。“穿自己所作出来的东西”，还有当年甘地的艰苦朴素的遗风。另外，这些精巧的手工艺的确也是历代印度人民聪明的创造。许多绘图、纺织都没有什么图样，信手画来纺来，成品却是很美丽的、具有较高艺术水平的艺术品。这些单位中的妇女大多是遭受了各种各样不幸的人，但是她们却都是极其聪明的人。据一位负责人告诉我们说：过去英帝国主义者曾经妒恨她们，有些手工业艺人因为她们的“巧夺天工”而被砍去了手指。
    印度妇女工作是多种多样的：难民救济、孤儿教养、接生和各种技术训练、贫儿学校、妇婴卫生、照料寡妇孤儿等。由于想使得印度人口不增加得太快太多，克服落后和贫穷，保护母婴，印度正在大力宣传“家庭计划”，主要是宣传节育，指导两性生活。当我们于1月上旬离开印度时，在加尔各答正在举行全印家庭计划会议。社会工作是印度有些知识妇女所乐于从事的工作，她们在理家之余常从事这些工作。
    代表团曾去印度尔列席全印妇女会议的年会，在年会上致祝辞并作了“中国妇女正在从事的工作”的报告。大会讨论了“扩大妇女就业范围”和“已婚妇女的部分就业问题”。因为在印度，家庭与就业成为妇女难以兼顾的一个问题，很多受过高等教育的妇女也往往在毕业以后就结婚家居。一位女子大学校长说学生毕业后就业的比率不大，医学院行政方面甚至为了培养出来的医学人才不能“学以致用”，而觉得造成浪费。印度副总统曾说，印度妇女参加工作的是越来越多了，问题一方面在自己争取，一方面必须解决家务和育儿问题。
    印度妇女很关心中国妇女如何兼顾工作和家庭，我们尽可能地答复了她们的问题。
    代表团在新德里、孟买、班加罗尔和马德拉斯，还受到印中友好协会会员们的热诚接待。在新德里盛大的招待会上，我们深深地被他们的歌声乐声所感动，三位青年男女在民族乐器的伴奏下豪迈地合唱了三只歌，虽然我们只听得出来“印地秦尼巴依巴依”一句，但是我们还听懂了他们的心——对中国的友谊和对中国人民的亲热。在孟买的招待会上，我们会见了柯棣华医生的母亲和妹妹，她们的亲人为中国人民的解放事业牺牲了宝贵的生命，我们向她们表示了慰问和感激。
    印度是一个地大物博、文化悠久的国家，这是我们早已知道的了。但是在三个星期的旅行访问中，更看到了印度人民的美丽——不仅仅是眉目轮廓和妇女的服饰美丽、民族歌舞美丽，而且因为他们有伟大的力量而显得更美丽。我们看出英帝国主义长期的殖民主义统治并没有摧毁得了印度人民的优越传统。中印两国都不讳言自己的积弱和落后，而且认为必须努力克服它们才能有前途。而中印两国间增进代表团的交往、文化交流和友好合作是非常有益的。
    十亿爱好和平的中印人民友谊以五项原则为指针，是更加巩固和发展了。中印两国人民的团结，对亚洲和世界和平将作出更多的贡献。在访印三周以后，我们更加强了这个信念。让我们在这里遥祝印度的日益繁荣和人民的幸福！让我们为中印人民的团结而努力、更努力吧！
