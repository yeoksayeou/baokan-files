Collection of Soviet Industrial Construction

    The Largest Open-Hearth Furnace in Europe
    The Voroshilov Metallurgical Plant in Voroshilovgrad has recently completed the construction of the largest open-hearth furnace in the Soviet Union and Europe. Its capacity is 500 tons. As everyone knows, the common open-hearth furnace capacity is from 50 to 185 tons, and the largest in the past only reached 400 tons.
    The Soviet Union spent seven and a half months building this open-hearth furnace, excavating 100,000 cubic meters of earth, using 15,000 tons of concrete and nearly 4,000 tons of metal.

    Europe's Deepest Drilling Well
    Soviet oil drillers in Ziria, east of Baku, the capital of the Azerbaijan Republic, have drilled Europe's deepest well, reaching a depth of 4,812 meters, or more than nine and a half li (approximately 4.75 kilometers) underground.
    This well has already started producing oil. The derrick built by the workers alone is 53 meters high. Drillers will also drill an oil well with a depth of 5,200 meters in Ziria.
    On a small island 30 kilometers southeast of Baku, oil drillers exploring the seabed of the Caspian Sea recently drilled the deepest offshore oil well in the Soviet Union, with a wellbore depth of 4,200 meters.

    The Soviet Union's Largest Mechanized Open-Pit Mine
    The Estonian Republic, which is rich in shale deposits, is about to build the Soviet Union's largest mechanized open-pit shale mine, with an annual output that will be twice the current total annual output of all shale mines in the republic.

    In Saratov, the Soviet Union's largest technical glass factory is under construction. The factory's main conveyor belt consists of 150 machine tools and is operated by television equipment.

    The Largest Cold Storage in Europe
    Moscow is building the largest cold storage facility in the Soviet Union and Europe. It can hold 36,000 tons of various foods, which is 14,000 tons more than the capacity of the largest cold storage in Paris.

    苏联工业建设集锦
    全欧洲最大的平炉
    伏罗希洛夫格勒的伏罗希洛夫冶金工厂，最近又建成了一座全苏联和全欧洲最大的平炉。它的容量是五百吨。大家知道，常用的平炉容量是五十吨到一百八十五吨，过去最大的只达到四百吨。
    苏联建成这座平炉共花了七个半月，挖了十万立方公尺泥土，用了一万五千吨混凝土和将近四千吨金属。
    欧洲最深的钻井
    苏联石油钻探工人在阿塞拜疆共和国首都巴库以东的齐里亚钻成了一个欧洲最深的钻井，井深达四千八百一十二公尺，即深入地下九市里半以上。
    这个钻井已经开始出产石油。单是工人们为它建立的钻塔就有五十三公尺高。钻探工人还将在齐里亚钻一个深达五千二百公尺的油井。
    在巴库东南三十公里的一个小岛上，钻探里海海底石油的钻探工人不久以前钻成了苏联最深的海底油井，油井的井筒深达四千二百公尺。
    苏联最大的机械化露天采矿场
    在盛产页岩矿的爱沙尼亚共和国，即将建设苏联最大的一个机械化露天页岩采矿场，它的年开采量将比共和国目前所有页岩矿的年总产量多一倍。
    在萨拉托夫城，正在建设苏联最大的一个技术玻璃工厂。工厂的主要传送带由一百五十台机床组成，并且用电视装置来操纵。
    全欧洲最大的冷藏库
    莫斯科正在建设一个全苏联和全欧洲最大的冷藏库。它可以容纳三万六千吨各种食品，比巴黎最大的冷藏库的容量多一万四千吨。
