Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 5th - The Indonesian government stated on the evening of January 4th, during a special government broadcast time on Radio Republik Indonesia, that the reports and commentaries in foreign newspapers and radio stations regarding events in Indonesia constitute interference in Indonesia's internal affairs. They are extremely biased and carry the nature of incitement and impolite criticism.

The government broadcast pointed out that foreign newspapers and news agencies conducting such blatant reporting include Dutch newspapers, the British "Times," "Manchester Guardian," "Daily Telegraph," and the American United Press International, among others. The broadcast accused these newspapers and news agencies of reporting and writing that the Indonesian government is no longer able to control the situation in Central and North Sumatra, which is contrary to the facts. Reports that revolts against the government will occur in other parts of Indonesia are also untrue, as law and order in other regions remain as normal.

The Indonesian government broadcast believes that foreign countries are systematically conducting this propaganda through newspapers and radio stations, taking advantage of every opportunity related to the domestic situation in Indonesia to attack the Indonesian government. Their interference has gone beyond the bounds of courtesy, which is a reprehensible action. The broadcast called on all members of Indonesian society, all parties, and all groups to unite, not to give foreign countries an opportunity to exploit, and to strive to defend the country and the nation.

    印度尼西亚政府
    指责美英荷宣传机器干涉内政
    新华社雅加达5日电　印度尼西亚政府4日晚上在印度尼西亚共和国广播电台特定的政府广播节目时间中说，外国报纸和电台关于印度尼西亚发生的事件的报道和评论是干涉印度尼西亚的内政，它们是极有倾向性的，并且带有煽动和不礼貌的批评的性质。
    政府的广播指出，进行这样露骨的报道的外国报纸和通讯社有荷兰的报纸，英国的“泰晤士报”、“曼彻斯特卫报”、“每日电讯报”和美国的合众社等。广播指责说，这些报纸和通讯社关于印度尼西亚政府不再能控制中苏门答腊和北苏门答腊情势的消息和文字是和事实相反的。关于印度尼西亚其他地方也将发生针对政府的暴动的消息也是不确实的，因为其他地区的治安和秩序仍然维持如常。
    印度尼西亚政府的广播认为：外国是有计划地通过报纸和电台进行这些宣传，他们利用有关印度尼西亚国内情势的每个机会来打击印度尼西亚政府。他们的干预已经超越礼貌范围，这是一种可以谴责的行动。广播号召印度尼西亚全体社会人士、各党派和各团体团结起来，不要给外国以可乘之机，努力保卫国家和民族。
