Xinhua News Agency, January 5th: The four large-scale milk powder factories in China, each with an annual output of over 1,000 tons, which are currently under construction, will be put into production one after another this year.

These four milk powder factories are located in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Yakeshi, Heilongjiang Province's Harbin, Zhaodong, and Gansu Province's Gannan, all regions with developed animal husbandry. The four new factories are all designed according to the latest technological achievements in the world. They will use high-pressure spraying and closed methods for production, and the production process from raw materials to finished products will be automated. The solubility of the produced milk powder can reach 99%.

The milk powder produced by these four large-scale milk powder factories in one year, if calculated at two and a half pounds per infant per month, can feed more than 500,000 infants for one year.
