Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 4th: Pham Hung, Minister of the Prime Minister's Office of Vietnam, accused the United States at the Vietnamese National Assembly on the afternoon of the 3rd of undermining the implementation of the Geneva Accords, sabotaging the reunification of Vietnam, and plotting to turn South Vietnam into a U.S. colony and military base.

Pham Hung once served as the Chairman of the Military and Administrative Committee of Eastern South Vietnam of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and as the representative of the Vietnam People's Army to the Joint Ceasefire Commission in South Vietnam. Today, he delivered a supplementary report to the National Assembly on the issue of the struggle for reunification.

Pham Hung said that the number of U.S. military personnel in South Vietnam was only four hundred when the ceasefire first took effect, but it has now increased to two thousand. The United States is constantly shipping war materials, including airplanes and artillery, into South Vietnam in an attempt to launch a war. More than 70% of U.S. aid to South Vietnam is used for military purposes. The United States also instigated Ngo Dinh Diem to suppress the people and launch a "purge of communists" campaign.

He also spoke about the South Vietnamese people's opposition to the rule of the United States and Ngo Dinh Diem, their demand for the peaceful reunification of the country, and their demand for improved living conditions. He said that the Vietnamese people must strive for every possibility to achieve contact between the northern and southern regions in order to achieve the goal of negotiated reunification. He said that the struggle for the reunification of North and South is a long and arduous struggle, but it will ultimately be victorious.

At the meeting held on the afternoon of the 3rd, the meeting also heard a supplementary report on land reform by Nguyen Duy Trinh, Deputy Minister of the President's Office.

    指责美国破坏越南的统一
    新华社河内4日电　越南总理府部长范雄3日下午在越南国民大会上指责美国破坏日内瓦协议的执行，破坏越南的统一，并且阴谋把南越变成美国的殖民地和军事基地。
    范雄曾经担任过越南民主共和国南越东部的军政委员会的主席和越南人民军驻南越联合停战委员会的代表。他在今天向国民大会作关于统一斗争的问题的补充报告。
    范雄说，美国在南越的军事人员在刚停战的时候只有四百人，到现在已经增加到两千人。美国不断把战争物资、包括飞机大炮运进南越，企图发动战争。美国对南越的援助70％以上是用于军事方面。美国还唆使吴庭艳镇压人民，展开“肃共”运动。
    他还谈到南越人民反对美国和吴庭艳的统治、要求通过和平方式统一国家和要求改善生活的情形。他说，越南人民要争取一切可能来达到北方和南方两个地区的接触，以便达到协商统一的目的。他说，争取北南统一的斗争是一个长期的和艰苦的斗争，但是最后一定能取得胜利。
    3日下午举行的会议还听取了主席府副部长阮维祯所作的关于土地改革的补充报告。
