Xinhua News Agency Tianjin Electric Dispatch: Tianjin is exploiting the potential of its suburbs. In 1956, it produced significantly more poultry, livestock, aquatic products, and dairy products than in previous years to meet the city's needs.

Now, guests arriving in Tianjin can immediately purchase hot, fresh milk at the East Station kiosk upon leaving the train, if they desire. Tianjin also has fourteen hot milk supply stations in densely populated residential areas, serving people's breakfast needs daily, much like soy milk shops. Mothers in Tianjin can also subscribe to milk delivery for their children at any time. According to the Tianjin Municipal Agriculture Department, the city's dairy cow population increased by nearly 500 in 1956, and milk production increased by more than 300,000 jin.

The development of pig, chicken, duck, and fish farming has also progressed in the suburbs of Tianjin. Statistics show that the number of pigs raised in the suburbs in 1956 increased by more than 150% compared to 1955. The 150,000 stuffing ducks raised by the food company and other units in the suburbs are also growing well, generally fattening to four or five jin, with the fattest reaching eight jin and four liang. Suburban aquatic products also increased by more than 1,000 tons in 1956 compared to 1955. Farmers have already utilized 20% of the ponds and ditches in the four suburban districts for fish farming.

Xinhua News Agency Shanghai, January 2nd: The suburban farmers of Shanghai are now supplying 70% of the vegetables consumed by the city's six million people. After cooperativization, Shanghai's suburban farmers overcame the attacks of typhoons and cold waves last year, with total vegetable production reaching approximately 14 million dan, an increase of 3 million dan compared to 1955.

The variety of vegetables has also increased. More than ten kinds of vegetables, such as Tianjin cabbage, Guangdong "Locomotive" radishes, and Beijing pink tomatoes, have been planted in the suburbs of Shanghai for the first time. Tomatoes, cucumbers, and other vegetables planted in hundreds of newly built greenhouses are growing well and have already begun to be harvested.

Since 1953, when Shanghai's suburbs began implementing the policy of serving the city, the area for vegetable cultivation has gradually expanded, and vegetable production has increased year by year.

    新华社天津电　天津市发挥郊区潜力，1956年生产了比往年多得多的家禽、家畜、水产和奶品，供应本市需要。
    现在来到天津的客人，一下火车走进东站小卖部，如果需要，马上可以吃到热腾腾的鲜牛奶。天津市内居民集中的地区，还设有这样的热奶供应站十四处，就像豆浆铺那样每天供应人们早点。天津的母亲们如果要在自己家里为孩子订饮牛奶，也随时可以订到。据天津市农业部门了解，1956年全市奶牛增加了将近五百头，奶产量增加了三十多万斤。
    天津郊区的养猪、养鸡、养鸭、养鱼等事业也有了发展。据统计，全郊区1956年饲养的生猪比1955年增加了一倍半以上。食品公司等单位在市郊放养的十五万只填鸭也长的很好，一般的都填到四、五斤重，最肥的达到八斤四两。郊区的各种水产品1956年也比1955年增加了一千多吨，四郊20％的水坑和河沟已被农民利用起来养鱼了。
    新华社上海2日电　上海市六百万人民吃的蔬菜已经有70％由市郊农民供应了。合作化后的上海市郊区农民，去年战胜了台风和寒流的袭击，蔬菜总产量达到一千四百万担左右，比1955年增加了三百万担。
    蔬菜种类也有增加。天津大白菜、广东火车头萝卜、北京粉红番茄等十多种蔬菜，已经第一次在上海市郊种植。在数百间新建的温室里，栽种的番茄、黄瓜等生长得很好，现在已经开始采摘了。
    上海市郊从1953年开始贯彻郊区为城市服务的方针以后，蔬菜种植面积逐年扩大，蔬菜的产量也逐年增加。
