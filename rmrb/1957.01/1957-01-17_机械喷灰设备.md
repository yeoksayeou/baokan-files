Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 15th. Li Shenghua, an advanced producer who has continuously created and improved twelve kinds of manual plastering tools, has recently successfully developed a mechanical spraying equipment.

The mechanical spraying equipment is composed of a mixer, an air compressor, a mortar pump, pipes, and a spray nozzle. The mortar, mechanically mixed, is no longer manually carried and lifted. Instead, the mortar pump sends it to the construction site through pipes. The plastering workers only need to open the spray nozzle, and the mortar is evenly sprayed on the brick or lath wall. At the Harbin Electric Brush Factory construction site, the Third Spraying Youth Shock Brigade, consisting of ten workers, completed the plastering of 905 square meters in five and a half hours. This is five times more efficient than the manual operation of ten plastering workers, and the project quality is excellent, eliminating the phenomenon of plaster peeling.

    机械喷灰设备
    据新华社哈尔滨15日电　曾经连续创造和改进十二种手工抹灰工具的先进生产者李升华，最近研究成功了一种机械喷灰设备。
    机械喷灰设备是由搅拌机、压缩空气机、砂浆泵、管子和喷灰嘴组成的。机械搅拌好的灰浆不再用人工挑灰和提灰，由砂浆泵通过管道压送到施工现场，抹灰工人只要打开喷灰嘴，灰浆就均匀地喷射在砖墙或板条墙上。在哈尔滨电刷厂工地，由十个工人组成的第三喷灰青年突击队，五个半小时就完成了九百零五平方公尺的抹灰任务，比十个抹灰工人手工操作的效率提高了五倍，而且工程质量很好，消灭了抹灰脱皮的现象。
