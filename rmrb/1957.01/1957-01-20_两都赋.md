Children open their mouths, young people open their eyes, we sing, sing: "Moscow, Beijing! Moscow, Beijing!" Moscow, Beijing! Your canal-like shining streets, the red clouds of flags in your squares, your mural-like rising buildings, your city green in spring and silver in winter! You record the glory of labor, you play the music of peace. Moscow, Beijing! Every piece of your sky and land is glorious. Napoleon collapsed in the smoke-filled Moscow, and the new youth made a sound in the cradle of Beijing. The flame of anti-fascist victory shot out seven colors from the Kremlin, and the doves of victory of socialist transformation flew from Tiananmen Square like silver stars all over the sky. The Five-Year Plan, the General Line, are formulated here. Oh, the warp and weft of transportation weave our country's new clothes, and cranes and drilling machines dig out the roots of our poverty. Moscow, Beijing! You are our lighthouse, our core! The sun of Marxism-Leninism shines on the earth, as if hydropower stations are built in everyone's heart. The east wind blows here, a hundred flowers bloom, and the throats of thinkers are competing like industrialized chimneys. Give us parks for cultural rest, give us Qi Baishi and Repin, give us Peking Opera, ballet, and national music teams, give us the People's Truth newspaper, sparks that stir our hearts, give us Russian-style painted paper, give us handicrafts from Dong'an Market... Moscow, Beijing! You are the epitome of glorious cities! When your light shines on the farthest reclamation area, the deepest bottom of the mine, I also see some dark cities in the world, where the cities are armed like hedgehogs, aimed at the countryside, workers lie in the sewers, treated as talking animals, there is disease, hunger, death, cold, man exploiting man... In the palaces of Washington, Paris, and London, gentlemen are politely holding white blades, trying to divide the world on a paper globe. Moscow, Beijing! We are raised in your beating hearts. We labor, and wish all laborers sing joyful songs, we love peace, and wish all people share peace, you also educate us to share happiness and suffering, share destiny, you also educate us to have great love, love all the oppressed people in the world. Every resident of our Beijing once stood on the street shouting loudly: Oppose the war of aggression against Egypt! Our Moscow once issued a declaration to the world: "We are determined to use force to restore peace in the East!" Moscow, Beijing! The whole world is opening its eyes to you. Every inch of your steps towards easing the tension makes the invaders shudder, Mussolini is playing the old tune of anti-communism on the gallows again, and Hitler is borrowing a corpse to return to the West. Moscow, Beijing! Unite even more closely! Unite even more closely! Our firm steps have no retreat, our strong arms are held tighter, our millions of people are dancing with one heart, our millions of mouths are singing one voice: "For glorious labor, for lasting peace!"…

    两都赋
    邹荻帆孩子们张开嘴唇，青年人睁亮眼睛，我们唱啊，唱啊：“莫斯科，北京！莫斯科，北京！”莫斯科，北京！你运河般光亮的街道，你广场上旗帜的红云，你壁画般树起的建筑，你春天绿化，冬天银装的城！你记录了劳动的光辉，你鸣奏着和平的乐音。莫斯科，北京！你的每一块天空和地面都是光荣。拿破仑就在烟火弥漫的莫斯科崩倒下去，新青年就在北京的摇篮里发出声音。反法西斯胜利的火焰从克里姆林宫射出七彩，社会主义改造胜利的喜鸽从天安门飞散像满天银星。五年计划，总路线，就在这里制定，哦，交通的经纬织缝了我们国家的新衣，起重机、钻探机挖掉我们的穷根。莫斯科，北京！你是我们的灯塔，我们的核心！马克思列宁主义的阳光普照大地，仿佛水电站建设在每个人的心灵。东风吹拂到这里，百花齐放，思想家的喉咙像工业化的烟突一样争鸣。给我们文化休息的公园，给我们齐白石和列宾，给我们京剧、芭蕾舞、民族音乐队，给我们人民真理的报纸，鼓动心胸的火星，给我们俄罗斯风的描花纸，给我们东安市场的手工艺品……莫斯科，北京！你是光辉城市的典型！当你的光芒照耀到最远的垦荒区、最深的矿藏的底层，我也看到了世界上一些阴暗的城，那里，城市像刺猬般武装着，对准乡村，工人躺在下水道，被当做能讲话的畜牲，那里是疾病、饥饿、死亡、寒冷、人剥削人……在华盛顿、巴黎、伦敦的宫殿里，绅士们正斯文地拿着白刃，对着纸糊的地球仪要把世界瓜分。莫斯科，北京！我们是在你跳动的心脏里抚养成人。我们劳动，愿劳动者都唱出欢乐的歌声，我们爱和平，愿天下人共享和平，你还教育我们同甘苦、共命运，你还教育我们伟大的爱，爱全世界受压迫的人。我们北京的每一户居民曾站在大街上高声喊着：反对侵略埃及的战争！我们莫斯科曾向世界发出宣言：“我们决心用武力恢复东方的和平！”莫斯科，北京！全世界向你睁亮着眼睛。你走向缓和紧张局势的每一寸步履都使侵略者肉跳心惊，墨索里尼又在绞架上弹起反共的老调，希特勒又在西方借尸还魂。莫斯科，北京！团结得更紧！团结得更紧！我们坚决的步伐有进无退，我们强大的臂膀挽得更紧，我们千万人跳着一颗心，我们千万张嘴唱着一个声音：“为光辉劳动，为持久和平！”……
