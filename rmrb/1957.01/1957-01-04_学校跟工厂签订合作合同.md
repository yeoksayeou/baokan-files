The signed contracts include the exchange of technical data, communication of research progress, and joint technical research on specific problems existing in production enterprises.

	The Iron Smelting Teaching and Research Section, entrusted by Benxi Iron and Steel Company, has completed the research on "self-fluxing lean agglomerates" as scheduled, enabling the site to use lean ore to produce a large number of agglomerates. The Tunneling Teaching and Research Group, due to signing a technical cooperation agreement with Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, received strong support from the factory in terms of manpower and material resources, and also completed the research on "improvement of the air inlet of rock drills" on schedule. Now they have signed a technical cooperation agreement for the research on "rock drill parameter measurement." The Metallography and Heat Treatment Teaching and Research Section, according to the contract, sent experienced teachers to give sixteen lectures to engineering and technical personnel of Benxi Iron and Steel Company. The teachers of the Iron Smelting Teaching and Research Section also gave thirteen special reports on iron smelting to Benxi Iron and Steel Company and held two study classes on sintering and iron smelting for engineering and technical personnel of Anshan Iron and Steel Works.

    学校跟工厂签订合作合同
    新华社沈阳2日电　一年多来，东北工学院同鞍钢炼铁厂、上海矿山机器厂、沈阳风动工具厂等七十多个生产企业签订了合作合同。签订的合同包括交换技术资料，互通研究情况以及根据生产企业存在的问题进行专题技术研究合作等。
    炼铁教研室接受本溪钢铁公司的委托，已如期完成了“自溶性贫团矿”的研究，使现场能够利用贫矿生产大量团矿。井巷教研组由于同沈阳风动工具厂签订了技术合作合同，得到这个工厂人力、物力上的大力帮助，也按期完成“凿岩机进气口的改进”的研究。现在他们又签订了“凿岩机参数测定”研究的技术合作合同。金相热处理教研室曾根据合同，派有经验的教师向本溪钢铁公司工程技术人员讲了十六次课。炼铁教研室的教师也给本溪钢铁公司作了十三次炼铁专题报告，还为鞍钢炼铁厂工程技术人员先后开了烧结和炼铁两个学习班。
    东北工学院同生产企业订立合同后，在进行科学研究和生产实习中也得到了对方的大力帮助。
