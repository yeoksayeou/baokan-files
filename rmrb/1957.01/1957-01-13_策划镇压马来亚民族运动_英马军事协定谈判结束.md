Xinhua News Agency report: The British Colonial Office announced on the 11th that the British government had reached an agreement with the Federation of Malaya delegation on signing a military agreement. This military agreement, which will be implemented after the Federation of Malaya declares its independence at the end of August, stipulates that Britain will provide "assistance" to the Kuala Lumpur government in the Federation of Malaya's external defense and in the training and development of the Federation of Malaya's army. In return, the Kuala Lumpur government will grant Britain the right to station troops in Malaya, including "strategic reserve forces" established by Britain and other Commonwealth countries to prepare for fulfilling "obligations" under the Manila Treaty.

Tunku Abdul Rahman, the Chief Minister of the Federation of Malaya, who led the delegation to London for these negotiations, left London on the 11th. In a radio speech, he said that he would probably go to London again after August to sign the Anglo-Malayan military agreement with Britain. In this speech, he once again expressed his desire for the Malayan National Liberation Army to surrender.

    策划镇压马来亚民族运动
    英马军事协定谈判结束
    据新华社讯　英国殖民地部11日宣布，英国政府已经同马来亚联合邦代表团就签订一项军事协定的问题达成协议。这项将于马来亚联合邦在8月底宣告独立以后实施的军事协定，规定英国将在马来亚联合邦的对外防务上和训练与发展马来亚联合邦的军队上“援助”吉隆坡政府，而吉隆坡政府将给予英国以在马来亚驻扎军队的权利，包括英国和英联邦其他国家为了准备履行对马尼拉条约的“义务”而设置的“战略后备部队”在内。
    率领代表团到伦敦进行这一谈判的马来亚联合邦首席部长拉赫曼已经在11日离开伦敦。他在一次广播演说中说，他大概会在8月以后再到伦敦去同英国签订英马之间的军事协定。他在这次演说中还再一次表示要马来亚民族解放军投降。
