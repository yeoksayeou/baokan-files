Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 9th dispatch from TASS: On the night of January 7th, the Soviet Embassy in West Germany was attacked by a group of thugs in cars. Many glass windows of the embassy and the adjacent club were smashed with stones. Police only belatedly appeared next to the Soviet Embassy forty minutes after the attack.

The thugs attacked again the following night, smashing some more windows of the club.

The anti-Soviet propaganda in West Germany has not subsided, and many important people, including some ministers, are participating in this propaganda. Therefore, the attack on the Soviet Embassy in West Germany cannot be regarded as a purely accidental phenomenon.

The Soviet Embassy in West Germany has lodged a protest with the West German government, demanding that responsibility be investigated and the safety of the Soviet Embassy be guaranteed.

    苏驻西德使馆遭匪徒袭击
    苏联已向西德政府提出抗议
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社波恩9日讯：1月7日夜间，苏联驻西德大使馆受到一批乘汽车的匪徒的袭击，大使馆和隔邻的俱乐部有许多玻璃窗被用石头打碎。警察在袭击事件发生后四十分钟才迟迟地在苏联大使馆旁边出现。
    匪徒们在第二天夜间又来袭击，他们又打碎了俱乐部的一些玻璃窗。
    现在西德的反苏宣传还没有平息，参加这种宣传的有许多要人，其中包括一些部长。因此，不能认为匪徒袭击苏联驻西德大使馆是一种纯粹偶然的现象。
    苏联驻西德大使馆已经向西德政府提出抗议，要求追究责任和保障苏联大使馆的安全。
