Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 7th: Preparations for the Lanzhou Thermal Power Plant to commence production are largely complete. The organizations of the seven branches, including the steam turbine, boiler, and electrical divisions, as well as some offices, have been established recently, and the staff of each department is basically fully equipped. More than 100 production operation procedures, which began to be compiled in September last year, will soon be completed.

    The Lanzhou Thermal Power Plant began construction at the end of 1955 and is expected to generate partial power in the second quarter of this year. To welcome the commissioning of this power station, as early as March 1955, the state transferred more than ten factory directors, chief engineers, operations team leaders, and production workers from power plants in Shanghai, Xi'an, and Northeast China to study in the Soviet Union. Now these people have returned to the factory to participate in the preparatory work of the thermal power station. The 260 production workers prepared for the commissioning of one machine and one boiler this year have been trained by old power plants across the country and are arriving at the thermal power station one after another. In addition, more than 50 young students participating in office work come from Shanghai, Northeast China, and Sichuan. After three or four months of general technical and business knowledge study, they are also able to perform their duties in various offices relatively well.

    兰州热电站准备开工
    据新华社兰州7日电　兰州热电站开工生产的准备工作大体完成。汽机、锅炉、电气等七个分场的机构和一些科室已在最近建立起来，各部门的职工也基本上配备齐全。从去年九月份开始编制的一百多种生产操作规程，即将全部编好。
    兰州热电站是在1955年底开始施工的，预计在今年第二季度就可以部分发电。为了迎接这个电站投入生产，早在1955年三月份，国家就从上海、西安和东北等各发电厂抽调了厂长、总工程师、运行班长和生产工人十多名，派到苏联去学习，现在这些人都回到厂里参加热电站的筹建工作。为今年一机一炉投入生产准备的二百六十名生产工人，是由全国各老电厂代为培养训练的，这些工人正陆续到达热电站。另有五十多名参加科室工作的青年学生是从上海、东北、四川各地来的，他们经过三、四个月一般技术和业务知识的学习也都能较好地担任各科室工作。
