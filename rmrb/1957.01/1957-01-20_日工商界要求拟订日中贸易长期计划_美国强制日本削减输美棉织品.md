Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th dispatch: Japanese business leaders are urging Prime Minister Tanzan Ishibashi or Foreign Minister Nobusuke Kishi to visit Washington as soon as possible to negotiate an agreement with the U.S. government to relax U.S. import restrictions on Japanese goods and to discuss Japan-China trade issues.

They also demanded that a long-term trade plan be formulated based on China's economic development plan to promote trade with China.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th dispatch: The Japanese government announced on the 16th that after four months of negotiations in Washington, the Japanese and U.S. governments had reached an agreement on Japan's "voluntary restriction" of cotton textile exports to the United States.

The five-year agreement stipulates that, beginning January 1 this year, Japan's annual quota for cotton textile exports to the United States will be 235 million square yards, of which cotton cloth will be limited to 113 million square yards, and secondary products converted to cotton cloth will be 122 million square yards.

Japan initially hoped to set the quota for cotton textile exports to the United States at 270 million square yards, which is equivalent to the level of Japan's cotton textile exports to the United States in 1955. Due to repeated pressure from the United States during the negotiations, the Japanese side was finally forced to repeatedly reduce the amount.

According to Kyodo News, Japanese cotton spinning industry insiders expressed strong dissatisfaction with the restriction measures.

    日工商界要求拟订日中贸易长期计划
    美国强制日本削减输美棉织品
    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本工商界领袖催促首相石桥湛山或者外务相岸信介早日访问华盛顿，同美国政府当局商订关于放宽美国对日本货进口限制的协议，并且讨论日中贸易问题。
    他们还要求根据中国经济发展计划，拟订长期贸易计划来促进同中国的贸易。
    据新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本政府16日宣布，在华盛顿经过四个月的谈判以后，日美两国政府已经就日本“自动限制”向美国输出棉织品一事达成协议。
    这项为期五年的协议规定，从今年1月1日开始，日本每年向美国出口棉织品的限额为二亿三千五百万平方码，其中棉布限额为一亿一千三百万平方码，二次制品折合棉布为一亿二千二百万平方码。
    日本最初希望把向美国输出棉织品的限额规定为两亿七千万平方码，也就是相当于1955年日本向美国输出的棉织品的水平。由于美国在谈判中屡次施加压力，日本方面终于被迫一再削减数额。
    据共同社报道，日本棉纺织业界人士对这次的限制措施表示十分不满。
