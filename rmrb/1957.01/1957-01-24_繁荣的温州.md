    Prosperous Wenzhou
    Shao Naixing
    When people see glazed tiles in workshops or office buildings, when they prepare Qin Diao brand milk powder for their beloved children, or when they pick up paper umbrellas like Da Tianjin and Xiao Tianjin on rainy days, they often think of the city of Wenzhou. Indeed, in recent years, the city of Wenzhou has become increasingly familiar to people as industrial products such as tiles, dairy products, paper umbrellas, and waxed paper sell well both domestically and abroad. Before liberation, this was the Zhao area of Yongjia County. It was located in a remote area of the southeast coast, downstream of a river not well known to people – the Oujiang River. At that time, it was an insignificant place both economically and politically.

    In the early days of liberation, Wenzhou, like other cities along the southeast coast, was located on the front lines of national defense, monitoring the enemy entrenched on islands such as Dachen and Pishan day and night, and constantly fighting against the US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents who infiltrated the mainland. At this time, Wenzhou did not have a single mile of open highway, let alone ocean-going ships. Only the turbulent flow of the Oujiang River connected it to the interior, and the "sampan" was the only means of transportation to the outside world. During these days, the production of many industrial products, such as cotton textiles, sawmills, paper umbrellas, and tiles, was reduced, and factories were in a state of shutdown or semi-shutdown.

    The enemies entrenched on islands such as Dachen and Pishan attempted to block the port of Wenzhou for a long time and suffocate the people of Wenzhou. However, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the people of the city took a series of measures such as adjusting industry and commerce, adjusting public-private and labor-capital relations, and expanding the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. As a result, many industrial products opened up sales channels, production gradually recovered, and embarked on the road of development.

    In the newly liberated Wenzhou City, the only factories taken over were the Wenzhou Waxed Paper Factory and the Renren Cannery, both dilapidated factories with a total of no more than forty employees. Now there are twenty-six new and expanded socialist factories in the city. The seventeen factories that were jointly operated by the end of 1955 have all undergone different degrees of expansion and renovation, and their appearance has been completely renewed compared with before the joint operation. When the Wenzhou Waxed Paper Factory was first taken over, the factory building was in a dilapidated ancestral hall in the countryside, with only sixteen employees; now, it is a new type of factory covering more than one hundred acres with more than six hundred employees. Wenzhou is one of the main rapeseed production areas in the country, but in the past, production relied on rural "oil presses," resulting in low oil yields and significant waste. This year, the state invested in the construction of a fully mechanized oil pressing plant, which will change the backwardness of the oil pressing industry. A mechanized and large-scale Wenzhou Shipyard stands in the eastern suburbs, constantly supplying fishing boats to tens of thousands of fishermen along the coast of southern Zhejiang and northern Fujian. The joint public-private Xishan Ceramics Factory has expanded from three kilns in the private period to eight kilns, and basic construction projects in factories and mines across the country receive a large number of tiles from here. In the past two years, the factory's products have been exported to fraternal countries such as North Korea and Vietnam. In the fourth quarter of last year, the factory rushed to produce tens of thousands of tiles for the Egyptian people. Now, whether in the eastern or southern suburbs, you can see newly built tall chimneys and scaffolding for building factories and warehouses. The urban area is gradually expanding to the suburbs. According to statistics, the total output value of local industry in 1955 increased nearly five times compared with 1950, exceeding the development speed of industrial production in any period before liberation.

    Wenzhou was a city known for its handicrafts in the past. Before liberation, the leather suitcases, straw mats, and paper umbrellas, known as the three major handicrafts of Wenzhou, suffered from poor quality and declining reputation, and sales became increasingly blocked. After liberation, through production reorganization and the cooperative movement, the socialist consciousness of employees was raised, the quality of products was significantly improved, and sales gradually expanded. From 1950 to 1955, the total output value of handicrafts in the city increased by 3.3 times. Among them, leather suitcases increased by twelve times, abacuses by twenty-one times, and bamboo chopsticks by sixty-nine times. Last year, there was a large increase again. The number of people engaged in handicrafts has increased to more than 17,000.

    With the development of production, the transportation industry has also developed accordingly. At present, the Wen (zhou) Lin (hai), Wen (zhou) Jin (hua), and Wen (zhou) Fu (zhou) highways have all been repaired and opened to traffic. After the liberation of coastal islands such as Dachen and Pishan, marine transportation has also become developed. Now there are ships to and from ports such as Shanghai, Ningbo, and Fuzhou. The volume of export cargo in 1955 increased by more than fifteen times compared with 1950. In the first half of last year, it increased by 43% compared with the same period of the previous year. In order to adapt to the needs of the development of sea transportation, many new wharf warehouses have been built, and two ship terminals have also been built. Wenzhou Port has now become the center of sea and land transportation in southern Zhejiang and northern Fujian.

    Due to the development of production, the material and cultural life of the people of the city has gradually improved. In recent years, the state has built a number of dormitories for employees. Eighteen main streets in the city have been renovated. The Xinhe Street, which was formerly called "Wenzhou's Dragon Beard Ditch" by citizens, has been turned into a wide avenue. Wenzhou had no buses in the past. Now two bus routes have been opened. Medical and health services have also made significant progress. The plague, which was spread by Japanese imperialism during the Anti-Japanese War and seriously harmed the people of Wenzhou, has now been eradicated. In terms of culture and education, the number of ordinary secondary schools has increased from four before liberation to eight now. The number of students in various schools in the city has reached more than 30,000. A higher education institution, Wenzhou Normal College, has also been established.

    The people of Wenzhou City have thus broken free from suffering and are steadily moving towards prosperity and happiness.

    繁荣的温州
    邵乃兴
    当人们在车间里，或者在办公大楼里看到一方方釉面瓷砖的时候，当人们为自己心爱的孩子冲调擒雕牌乳粉的时候，或者在雨天拿起大天津小天津这样的纸伞的时候，往往会联想起温州这个城市来。是的，温州这个城市近年来随着瓷砖、乳品、纸伞，腊纸这些工业品的畅销国内外，逐渐被人们熟悉起来了。解放前，这里是永嘉县沼。它偏处东南沿海一条不被人们注意的河流——瓯江的下游。那时候，它无论在经济上、政治上都是无足轻重的地方。
    解放初期，温州和东南沿海其他城市一样，处在国防前哨，日夜监视着盘踞在大陈、披山这些岛屿上的敌人，时刻和潜入大陆的美蒋特务作斗争。这时候，温州这个城市没有一寸通车的公路、更谈不上海洋轮船。仅仅借瓯江一脉湍流和内地相接连，“舴艋舟”是唯一的对外交通工具。在这些日子里，许多工业产品，如棉织、锯木、纸伞、瓷砖的生产都减缩了，工厂处在停工和半停工状态。
    盘踞在大陈、披山这些岛屿上的敌人，企图长期封锁着温州的港口，窒息温州的人民。但是，全市人民在党和人民政府的领导下，采取调整工商业、调整公私和劳资关系、扩大城乡物资交流等一系列措施。许多工业品于是打开销路，生产逐步恢复，并且走上了发展的道路。
    刚解放的温州市，接管的工厂仅有温州腊纸厂和人人罐头厂两个破烂的工厂，全部职工不过四十人。现在全市新建扩建的社会主义性质的工厂有二十六个。1955年底合营的十七个厂，全部进行了程度不同的扩建和改建，较合营前的面貌有了崭新的变化。温州腊纸厂刚接办的时候，厂房在乡间一座破旧的祠堂内，职工仅十六人；现在呢，已经是一个占地一百多亩拥有六百多个职工的新型工厂了。温州是全国油菜籽的主要产区之一，但过去都靠乡间“油车”进行生产，出油率低，浪费很大。今年国家投资兴建一座全部机械化的榨油厂，将改变榨油工业的落后面貌。一座机械化的规模宏大的温州造船厂在东郊矗立起来了，不断地给浙南闽北沿海数万渔民供应着渔船。公私合营西山陶磁厂，由过去私营时期的三座窑扩建到八座窑，全国各地的厂矿基本建设工程，从这里得到大量的磁砖。近二年来，这个厂的产品远销到朝鲜、越南等兄弟国家，去年第四季度这个厂又为埃及人民赶制了十数万块瓷砖。现在不论在东郊或南郊，到处可以看到新建的高大的烟囱和建设厂房、仓库的脚手架。市区正逐渐向四郊扩大。据统计，1955年地方工业总产值比1950年增加将近五倍。超过解放前任何时期工业生产的发展速度。
    温州过去是以手工业著称的城市，解放前称为温州三大手工业品的皮箱、草席、纸伞，由于质量低劣、信誉下降，销路日趋闭塞。解放后，通过生产改组和合作化运动，从业职工社会主义觉悟提高，产品质量显著改善，销路日渐扩大。从1950年到1955年，全市手工业总产值增长了三点三倍。其中皮箱增长了十二倍，算盘二十一倍，竹筷六十九倍。去年又有了很大增长。从事手工业的人员增加到一万七千余人。
    随着生产的发展，交通运输业也有了相应的发展。目前，温（州）临（海）、温（州）金（华），温（州）福（州）等三条公路线均先后修复通车。大陈、披山等沿海岛屿解放以后，海洋交通也跟着发达起来，现在和上海、宁波、福州等港口都有轮船往来。1955年出口货运量比1950年增加了十五倍多。去年上半年又比前年同期增加了43％。为了适应海运发展的需要，新建了许多码头仓库，两座轮船码头也跟着建设起来。温州港现在已成为浙南、闽北海陆交通的中心。
    由于生产的发展，全市人民物质文化生活也逐渐提高了。几年来，国家为职工建造了一批宿舍，全市有十八条主要街道翻修一新，过去被市民称为“温州的龙须沟”的信河街，修成了大马路。温州过去没有公共汽车。现在已经开辟了二路公共汽车、医疗保健事业也有了显著的发展，抗日战争期间日本帝国主义散布下来的、严重祸害温州人民的鼠疫，现在已经绝迹。在文化教育方面，普通中等学校由解放前的四所增加到现在的八所。全市各类学校学生人数已达到三万余人。一所高等学校——温州师范专科学校，也已建立起来。
    温州市的人民，就这样挣脱了苦难，稳步地走向繁荣和幸福。
