Xinhua News Agency, January 10th: Cairo Radio broadcast on the evening of the 9th that Yemen had requested the United Nations to help stop British aggression against Yemen.

The radio station said that when the Yemeni ambassador to Egypt, Taleb, announced this request, he stated that British aggression against Yemen endangered world peace.

Taleb pointed out that the British statement on the 9th, which claimed that Yemeni tribal people and regular forces "had attacked the so-called Aden Protectorate," was a "pure lie."

He said that Britain put forward this statement to "cover up Britain's aggressive attitude, mislead world opinion, and provide new means to justify the barbaric actions against Yemen."

Xinhua News Agency, January 11th: TASS, Bonn, January 11th: The Chargé d'Affaires of Yemen to West Germany, Bedani, held a press conference on the 10th and issued a statement regarding the British armed forces' aggression against Yemen.

Bedani asked people to pay attention to the fact that the Aden region was seized by Britain through violence and terror. He emphasized that the Yemeni government will never recognize the British, who claim to be "protectors," as having the legitimate right to reside in Aden and those places adjacent to Aden.

Bedani said that the British government declared a state of emergency in the Aden region and took aggressive actions such as bombing, destroying peaceful villages, and turning Yemeni buildings near the area into ruins. He said that these British actions have aroused open opposition from residents throughout the Aden region and its vicinity, who are demanding the return of these places to Yemen.

Bedani said that on the night of December 24, 1956, British aircraft began to air raid peaceful Yemeni villages, killing hundreds and seriously injuring thousands, mainly women, children, and the elderly. The attacks by British aircraft and the advance of tanks have caused serious damage to some towns in Yemen.

Bedani said that the events that have occurred in the southern Arabian Peninsula have been notified to the United Nations. He said that British troops should cease their acts of aggression against Yemen. As for Yemen, it will resolutely strive to eliminate the current conflict by peaceful means. However, if Britain continues its aggression and British aircraft continue to attack Yemeni towns, then in this case, the Yemeni government will use all possible means to resist aggression.

Bedani said in response to a reporter's question that Yemen has received many applications from various countries from people who wish to help the Yemeni people resist British aggression as volunteers.

    也门要求联合国制止英国侵略
    指责英国非法霸占亚丁和附近地区
    据新华社10日讯　开罗电台9日晚间广播，也门已经要求联合国帮助制止英国对也门的侵略。
    这家电台说，也门驻埃及公使塔列布在宣布这个要求时说，英国对也门的侵略危及了世界和平。
    塔列布指出，英国在9日发表的公报中所说的也门的部落人民和正规部队“已经进攻了所谓亚丁保护地”的说法，是“纯粹的谎言”。
    他说，英国提出这种说法的目的是为了“掩盖英国的侵略态度，迷惑世界舆论，并且为辩护对也门进行的野蛮行动提供新的手段”。
    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社波恩11日讯：也门驻西德代办贝达尼在10日举行记者招待会，就英国武装部队侵略也门一事发表声明。
    贝达尼要求人们注意亚丁地区被英国用暴力和恐怖手段夺取的事实。他强调指出，也门政府决不承认以“保护者”自居的英国人居留在亚丁和那些邻近亚丁的地方是合法的。
    贝达尼说，英国政府宣布亚丁地区处于非常状态，并且采取了轰炸、破坏和平村镇，把也门在这个地区附近的建筑物变为废墟的侵略行为。他说，英国人的这种行动激起了整个亚丁地区和亚丁附近地区居民的公开反对，这些地区的居民要求把这些地方归还也门。
    贝达尼说，1956年12月24日夜间，英国飞机开始空袭也门的和平村镇，炸死数百人，重伤数千人，其中主要是妇女、儿童和老人。英国飞机的袭击和坦克的进攻，使也门境内的一些市镇遭到严重的破坏。
    贝达尼说，在阿拉伯半岛南部所发生的事件已经通知了联合国。他说，英军应当停止对也门的侵略行动。至于也门，它将坚决努力以和平方式消除现在的冲突。但是，如果英国继续进行侵略，英国飞机仍旧袭击也门市镇，那么在这种情况下，也门政府将利用一切可能的方法来抵抗侵略。
    贝达尼在回答记者问题时说，也门接到从各国寄来的许多申请书，申请者表示希望以志愿人员的身份帮助也门人民抵抗英国侵略。
