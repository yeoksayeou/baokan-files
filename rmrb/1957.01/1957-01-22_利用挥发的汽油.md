    Utilizing Evaporated Gasoline
    The Guangzhou Public-Private Joint New China United Bandage Factory recently installed gasoline recovery equipment on the adhesive plaster coating machine in the adhesive cloth workshop to recover gasoline that evaporates into the air. The trial run on January 9th was very successful, recovering 58 kilograms of gasoline that day. It is estimated that over 29,000 kilograms of gasoline can be saved annually.
    The New China United Bandage Factory manufactures adhesive bandages and needs over 40,000 kilograms of gasoline each year. The gasoline is used to dissolve rubber and then evaporates. In the fourth quarter of last year, the factory's Party branch and public representatives led the workers, uniting and encouraging the private sector personnel, to begin researching a gasoline recovery machine. By January 8th of this year, the machine was fully installed.

    利用挥发的汽油
    广州市公私合营新华联合敷料厂最近在胶布车间涂膏机上安装了回收汽油的设备，把挥发在空气中的汽油收回来。1月9日试车，效果很好，这天就收回了汽油五十八公斤，预计全年可节约二万九千多公斤汽油。
    新华联合敷料厂制造胶布，每年需用汽油四万多公斤，而汽油用来溶解橡胶后便挥发掉了。去年第四季度，这个工厂的党支部和公方代表领导着职工，团结和鼓励私方人员，开始研究回收汽油的机器，到今年1月8日就把机器全部安装好了。
