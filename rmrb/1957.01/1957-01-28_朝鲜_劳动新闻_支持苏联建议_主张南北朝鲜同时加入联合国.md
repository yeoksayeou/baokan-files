Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 27th: The North Korean newspaper "Rodong Sinmun" today published an editorial supporting the Soviet representative's proposal in the United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee to accept both the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea into the United Nations simultaneously.

The newspaper's editorial pointed out that, contrary to the proposals put forward by representatives of the United States and other countries to unilaterally admit South Korea into the United Nations in order to prolong the division of Korea, the Soviet proposal helps the Korean people to achieve peaceful reunification themselves. The editorial said that if the Soviet proposal is adopted, it will provide North and South Korea with the opportunity to conduct contact and talks, which will help the rapprochement between North and South Korea and ease the tense situation in Korea.

The editorial said that eliminating the division of Korea and achieving peaceful reunification is the urgent desire of the Korean people. The solution to the Korean issue must start from here.

The editorial said that if the United States and its followers continue to stubbornly adhere to their proposal to unilaterally admit South Korea into the United Nations and reject the Soviet proposal, it can only further expose their ugly face of disregarding the interests of the Korean people and obstructing the resolution of the Korean issue.

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”支持苏联建议
    主张南北朝鲜同时加入联合国
    新华社平壤27日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表社论，支持苏联代表在联合国大会特别政治委员会上提出的关于接受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和南朝鲜同时加入联合国的建议。
    这家报纸的社论指出，和美国等国家的代表提出的让南朝鲜单方面加入联合国以延长朝鲜的分裂的建议相反，苏联的这项建议有助于朝鲜人民自己来实现和平统一。社论说，如果苏联的这项建议获得通过，将会使南北朝鲜有机会进行接触和会谈，有助于南北朝鲜的接近和缓和朝鲜的紧张局势。
    社论说，消除朝鲜的分裂，实现和平统一，是当前朝鲜人民的迫切愿望。有关朝鲜的问题的解决必须从这里出发。
    社论说，如果美国和它的追随者继续顽固地坚持它们提出的让南朝鲜单方面加入联合国的建议，拒绝苏联的建议，这只能进一步暴露它们不顾朝鲜人民的利益来阻挠朝鲜问题的解决的丑恶面目。
