As the train speeds across the North China Plain, a vast and flat expanse of fields unfolds before us. One can't help but imagine that with the advancement of the nation's socialist construction, irrigation and drainage channels will crisscross the land in just a few short years. Countless tractors will replace wooden plows. This vast land is a natural area for mechanized farming. The North China Plain will become the motherland's cotton and grain storehouse. Similarly, in the Yellow River basin's various river valley plains and basins, such as the rich Fen River basin, the "eight hundred li of Qinchuan" in the Jing and Wei River valleys, and the Yellow River's "uniquely rich" Hetao region, all are rich agricultural areas traversed by the Yellow River and its tributaries. For two or three thousand years, our ancestors have successively conquered nature with their labor and wisdom, developing these lands into the cradle of the Chinese nation. Here, we can see the traces of labor from all dynasties everywhere. As far back as the edge of the desert in the Yinchuan Plain, the construction of the Qin Canal, Han Canal, and Tanglai Canal applied the Yellow River water to irrigation, changing the natural conditions and achieving harvests. These are all great achievements of our ancestors in utilizing nature and transforming nature. Now, these rich lands will all shoulder the new task of building socialism. Through science and labor, we will further transform nature, develop agriculture, support the industrial construction needed for grain and raw materials, and undertake the supply of agricultural and livestock products needed by emerging industrial cities.

But the characteristic of socialist agriculture should be the continuous development of soil fertility on the existing basis, to achieve high and stable yields. This requires us to fully and deeply study the soil and natural conditions, scientifically summarize the existing experience, and further strive to transform nature and release soil fertility. We should identify the natural conditions that limit the development of agricultural production and suppress or eliminate them. For example, the North China Plain has significant natural conditions that limit its agricultural production and development. To this day, soil fertility has not been fully released, and yields are still very low. It is unreasonable that such a good agricultural area still needs grain supplies from other places. Some have analyzed that the key problem dominating this production limitation is the lack of organic matter in the soil. Indeed, the organic matter content in the soil of the North China Plain is relatively low, only 0.5% to 1%. This is a problem that urgently needs to be overcome. But if we solve the problem of soil organic matter in the North China Plain, will we be able to achieve high and stable yields? Facts tell us that it is still impossible. Because the North China region is dry and water-scarce in the spring, sometimes even sowing is difficult, and irrigation needs to be developed urgently; in the summer, there is often waterlogging and flooding, which affects agricultural production. Waterlogging can also raise the groundwater level, forming soils with varying degrees of salinization. The accumulation of salt in the soil affects seedling emergence and normal crop growth. In the coastal areas, almost all of the soil is saline soil, which further limits the crop planting area. The increase in this saline wasteland and bare land directly limits agricultural production. This uneven distribution of drought and flood, spring drought and summer flood, and the presence of salt in the soil are the leading factors limiting agricultural production in the North China region. In the dry grasslands and desert grasslands of the Northwest, rainfall is even less than in North China. Areas like Hetao and Yinchuan would not be agricultural areas at all without irrigation. For these areas, ensuring stable and high yields in agricultural production depends on the development of irrigation. As for soil salinity, it needs to be leached and drained. In the current Yellow River basin plan, the full utilization of water and land resources and the development of irrigation have become one of the important projects.

However, when developing irrigation in the Yellow River basin, if the soil and groundwater properties are not fully understood, soil salinization may be caused by the rise of the groundwater level and the evaporation and transpiration of mineralized groundwater. The original intention was to increase agricultural production, but it led to reduced production instead. There have been many lessons learned in this regard in the past. In the famous old irrigation areas such as Yinchuan, Hetao, Fen River, and Jing River, the area salinized due to irrigation is very large. This is because in arid and semi-arid areas, soil leaching is relatively slight, the soil contains a certain amount of salt, and the groundwater also has varying degrees of mineralization. Once the groundwater level rises, salt accumulates, harming crops. In response to this situation, before developing irrigation, a comprehensive soil and hydrogeological survey and research must be conducted on the entire area to understand the natural conditions and formulate improvement measures.

It is worth noting that in many places, agricultural and water conservancy construction has not been carried out according to this procedure, resulting in great losses to land resources, which directly affects production. There are many such examples in the old irrigation areas, which urgently need to be transformed. Even in the early days of liberation, this situation continued to occur. For example, what was the result of the construction of the Jinmen Canal and the Shuiyuesi Irrigation Area in Cangxian County near Beijing? Production increased in the first year of irrigation, decreased in the second year, and salinization became widespread in the third year. The local people reflected, "Even if you beat me to death, I won't irrigate the land." It's not that irrigation itself is bad, but because sufficient scientific data were not obtained in advance, and appropriate measures were not formulated before opening the canals for irrigation, causing large-scale flooding and soil salinization. Unfortunately, we have not summarized these lessons well, and this year a new irrigation area was opened in Xincheng County, south of the Jinmen Canal. When soil scientists pointed out the lessons of Jinmen Canal to them, they retorted that the Shijin Irrigation Area was also opened in the Shijiazhuang area, and no salinization has been seen in seventy years. They do not understand that the Shijin Irrigation Area is located on the alluvial fan of the Taihang Mountains, the soil has developed towards brown soil, and the groundwater quality is also very light. The soil quality is fundamentally different from that of the Jinmen Canal. The soil conditions in Xincheng County are exactly the same as those in Jinmen Canal. This is because they did not use scientific methods to understand nature, but only looked at nature superficially, which will inevitably cause great losses to land resources.

The same kind of problem also appears in the reclamation of wasteland. In 1950, in order to create experience in mechanized farming, many places established mechanized farms. However, because they did not conduct good surveys and research on the soil and natural conditions, but only relied on a glance, seeing a large piece of good wasteland, they decided to reclaim it. As for the soil characteristics and the causes of the wasteland, they did not understand, let alone formulate a set of improvement measures. As a result, houses were built, tractors were transported, but the reclaimed land only turned the turf over, did not absorb seedlings, and did not infiltrate water, so it had to be abandoned. In Sarachi, Inner Mongolia, 50,000 mu of wasteland were reclaimed, but only more than 1,000 mu absorbed seedlings after sowing. It turned out that the soil contained a lot of salt and soda, which was very harmful to crops and could not be used. This kind of thing still happens constantly, causing great losses to the country's human and material resources.

Without fully understanding nature, blindly carrying out agricultural and water conservancy construction, at best, will not achieve great results and cannot fully utilize soil fertility; at worst, it will cause undue losses to land resources. Soviet experts often criticize us for not having soil data, how can we reclaim land? Without soil and hydrogeological data, how can we develop irrigation? But we used to do it without data, which caused bad consequences.

In addition, there is also a "better than nothing" mentality regarding the requirements for data. Sometimes, on the surface, it seems that there are survey data, such as soil data, but these data do not dialectically indicate the occurrence and evolution of the soil; nor do they indicate the soil characteristics and salinity. This is also of little guiding significance for agricultural production. Because without sufficient scientific data, natural phenomena cannot be fully explained. Agricultural production itself is a science of fighting against nature. Farmers have a set of simple experiences in observing natural phenomena and fighting against nature; advanced scientific achievements also have a set of methods for dialectically mastering nature. We must not only use the beneficial experiences of farmers, but also apply advanced scientific methods for investigation and research to grasp sufficient data. Only in this way can we put the guidance of agricultural production on a reliable scientific basis to ensure stable and high yields in agricultural production, otherwise we will inevitably take detours.

Judging from the current situation, there are many problems in using farmers' experience and learning advanced Soviet science. For example, in saline soil improvement, there has been a debate in Soviet literature against drainage and salt leaching, but after years of testing and production practice, it has long been proven that drainage has a good effect on saline soil improvement. The Soviet Union already had an affirmative conclusion at the 1954 national soil conference. However, when we learn advanced Soviet science, we do not look at it from a developmental perspective, but blindly learn things that the Soviet Union has already criticized. Some areas are still trying salt leaching without drainage, claiming that it is based on Soviet theoretical basis. Some people also believe that improving saline soil with cultivation methods instead of drainage and salt leaching is the experience of our country's farmers. Indeed, our country's farmers have a set of methods for improving saline soil with cultivation. But it should be analyzed that in the old China's small-scale peasant economy, with land divided, it was impossible to carry out large-scale drainage measures. Today, with collectivized agriculture, it is possible to fundamentally improve saline soil by using drainage measures. We should scientifically summarize and utilize the valuable experience accumulated by farmers in improving saline soil. If measures to improve saline soil with cultivation can be carried out on the basis of drainage facilities, the effect will be even greater.

In addition, Soviet experience tells us that opposing large-scale flooding irrigation is an effective measure to prevent secondary salinization. Large-scale flooding irrigation will raise the groundwater level and cause soil salinization. But this measure can only be implemented in areas where there is no soil salinization. If the soil has already been salinized, then the salt in the soil must be washed away first and the mineralized groundwater must be drained before planting. In the Hetao area, there are phenomena of severe soil salinization due to large-scale flooding irrigation. The local farmers' method is to first wash the salt with a larger amount of water and then plant. This method is used reluctantly in the absence of drainage facilities, and the consequences will certainly not be very good. But our task is to further delve into the technology and expand the effect on the basis of the existing experience of farmers. However, some places are not doing this now. They only simply emphasize reducing the amount of irrigation water. As a result, the amount of water is not enough to suppress the salt, and a large amount of salt in the soil rises, causing severe seedling death. This is because they did not seriously study the experience of farmers and the specific situation, nor did they study the spirit of Soviet literature, but simply controlled the amount of water, resulting in "throwing the baby out with the bathwater."

All these facts tell us that in order to achieve stable agricultural harvests, on the one hand, we must combine farmers' experience with advanced science for research and utilization, but more importantly, we must fully understand the natural conditions. China's natural conditions are very complex. The Yellow River basin has its own unique soil and natural conditions, which are different from the Yangtze River basin and also different from the Soviet Union. But nature has its general operating laws, and advanced Soviet experience can still be used as a reference. The problem lies in combining advanced scientific experience with our specific conditions, discovering the limiting factors in agricultural production, and then constantly overcoming them to more effectively develop soil fertility. The series of achievements made by the Soviet Union in arid and semi-arid regions during the period of socialist construction give us the confidence to understand nature, transform nature, and more effectively utilize our land resources, so that the North China Plain and the Yellow River basin can supply us with more and better cotton and grain.

    让土壤学更好地为生产服务
    席承藩
    当火车急驰在华北大平原上的时候，展现在我们眼前的是一片平坦广阔的田野。人们很自然地联想到，随着国家社会主义建设的开展，在短短的几年后，将出现纵横交错的灌溉和排水渠道。无数的拖拉机将代替木犁。因为这样广阔的土地，是天然的机耕地带。华北平原将成为祖国的棉粮宝库。同样，在黄河流域大小不同的河谷平原和盆地，像富饶的汾河盆地、“八百里秦川”的泾渭河谷、黄河“独富一套”的河套，都是黄河及其支流所贯串着的富饶的农业区。两三千年来，我们的祖先用劳动和智慧，相继地战胜了自然，开拓了这些土地，成为中华民族发祥的摇篮。在这里，我们到处可以看到历代劳动的遗迹。远在沙漠边缘的银川平原上，有秦渠、汉渠、唐徕渠的修建，把黄河水应用于灌溉，改变了自然条件，得到了收成。这些都是我们祖先利用自然、改造自然的伟大成果。现在，这些富饶的土地，都将担负起建设社会主义的新任务。通过科学和劳动，我们将更进一步地改造自然，发展农业，支援工业建设所需的粮食和原料，担负起供应新兴工业城市所需的农畜产品。
    但社会主义农业的特点，应该是在现有的基础上，不断发展土壤肥力，作到高额而稳定的丰收。这就需要我们充分深入地研究土壤及自然条件，科学地总结已有的经验，进一步为改造自然，释放土壤肥力而努力。我们应找出限制发展农业生产的自然条件，并加以抑制或消除。例如华北平原，在农业的生产和发展上，是有很大自然条件的限制因素的，至今土壤肥力没有充分释放，产量还很低。这样好的农业地区，还有待外地供给粮食，是很不合理的。这种生产上的限制因素，有人曾分析说主导的关键问题是土壤中有机质缺乏。诚然，华北平原的土壤中，有机质含量均较低，只有0.5％到1％。这是急待克服的问题。但假使我们把华北平原的土壤有机质问题解决了，是否就能够作到高额而稳定的收成呢？事实告诉我们，还不可能。因为华北春季干旱缺水，有时连播种也感困难，急待发展灌溉；到夏季，又多内涝积水，影响农业生产。内涝更可使地下水位提高，形成不同盐化的土壤。土壤中盐分累积后，影响纳苗和作物正常生长。在滨海一带，几乎全为盐土，更限制了作物种植面积。这种盐土荒地和光板地的增多，直接限制了农业生产。这种旱涝不均，春旱夏涝，土壤中含有盐分，才是华北地区限制农业生产的主导因素。在西北的干草原和漠境草原，雨量比华北更少，像河套、银川一带，没有灌溉就根本不成为农业地区。像这样一些地区，要保证农业生产的稳定丰收，都有赖于发展灌溉。至于土壤含盐，则有待于冲洗排水。在当前的黄河流域规划中，充分利用水利与土地资源，发展灌溉，就成为重要项目之一。
    但黄河流域发展灌溉时，如对土壤及地下水性质掌握不够充分，很可能因地下水位上升，矿化地下水经蒸发蒸腾而引起土壤盐化。原意想把农业生产提高，反而招致减产。这一方面，过去的教训是很多的。有名的银川、河套、汾河、泾河等老灌区，因灌溉而致盐化的面积很大。这是因为在干旱、半干旱地区，土壤淋溶较轻微，土壤都含一定盐分，地下水也有不同程度的矿化，一俟地下水位提高，就形成盐分累积，为害作物。针对这种情况，在发展灌溉前，必须对整个地区进行一次全面的土壤和水文地质调查研究，摸清自然状况，拟定改良措施。
    值得重视的是，在很多地方还没有按这种程序进行农业和水利建设，因而给土地资源造成很大损失，直接影响了生产。旧灌区这种事例很多，急待我们改造。就是解放初期，这种情况还不断发生。像北京附近金门渠和沧县水月寺灌区的修建，结果怎么样呢？灌水第一年增产，第二年减产，第三年普遍盐化。当地群众反映，“就是打死我也不浇地了”。这不是浇地本身不好，而是事先没有取得充分科学资料，并定出适当措施，就开渠灌水，使大水漫灌，引起土壤盐化。可惜我们对这些教训并没有很好总结，今年又在金门渠以南的新城县开了一个灌区。当土壤科学工作者们给他们指出金门渠的教训时，他们反说石家庄一带也开了石津灌区，七十年来未见盐化。他们不了解，石津灌区位于太行山冲积扇上，土壤已向褐土发展，地下水质也很淡，土质和金门渠根本不同。而新城县的土壤条件，正和金门渠相同。这是因为他们没有用科学的方法认识自然，只从表面上看自然，必然会给土地资源造成很大的损失。
    同样性质的问题，也出现在开垦荒地上。1950年为了创造机械化耕作的经验，不少地方开办了机耕农场，也因为没有很好调查研究土壤及自然条件，只靠两眼一瞄，看到一片好大荒地，就决定开垦。至于土壤特性，致荒原因，并没有了解，更没有拟出一套改良措施。结果房子盖起了，拖拉机运到了，开出来的地只使草皮翻了个身，不纳苗，不渗水，只好放弃。内蒙古萨拉齐曾开荒五万亩，播种后纳苗的只有一千多亩。原来土壤里含盐很重，又含有为害作物很大的苏打，不能利用。这种事例在目前还不断出现，给国家人力物力造成很大损失。
    没有充分认识自然，就盲目地进行农业及水利建设，轻则收效不大，不能充分利用土壤肥力；重则使土地资源遭到不应有的损失。苏联专家常批评我们，没有土壤资料，怎么可以开垦？没有土壤及水文地质资料，怎么可以发展灌溉？而我们以前正是没资料就干，造成了不良后果。
    另外，对资料的要求还有一种“聊胜于无”的思想。有些时候，表面上看见也有了勘察资料，如土壤资料，但这些资料没有辩证地指明土壤的发生和演变情况；也没指明土壤特性与盐分情况。这对农业生产的指导意义也不大。因为没有足够的科学资料，就不能充分解释自然现象。农业生产本身是一门和大自然作斗争的科学，农民在观察自然现象和自然作斗争方面有一套纯朴的经验；先进科学成果，也有一套辩证地掌握自然的方法。我们既要利用农民的有益的经验，又要应用先进的科学方法进行考察研究，掌握充分的资料。只有这样才能把对农业生产的指导放到可靠的科学的基础上，以保证农业生产的稳定丰收，否则就必然要走弯路。
    从目前情况来看，在利用农民经验和学习苏联先进科学上，都有很多问题。比如盐土改良，苏联文献上曾有过反对排水洗盐的论争，但经过多年来的试验和生产实践的考验，早证明排水对盐土改良是有良好效果的。苏联在1954年全国性的土壤会议上，已经有了肯定性的结论。但我们学习苏联先进科学时，不从发展的观点来看，还一味地学苏联已经批判过了的东西。现在有些地区仍在试行无排水洗盐，还说是从苏联的理论根据出发的。也有人认为不用排水洗盐，而用耕作的方法改良盐土，是我国农民的经验。诚然，我国农民是有一套用耕作改良盐土的办法。但应该分析，在旧中国小农经济，土地分割的情况下，是不可能进行大规模排水措施的。而今天有了合作化的农业，利用排水措施根本改良盐土就有了可能。我们应该科学地总结和利用农民改良盐土所积累的宝贵经验，如果能把耕作改良盐土的措施，在有排水设施的基础上进行，收效当会更大。
    另外，苏联经验告诉我们，反对大水漫灌，是防止次生盐化的有效措施。大水漫灌会把地下水位提高，引起土壤盐化。但这只是在没有土壤盐化的地区才能实行这种措施，如果土壤已经盐化了，那就必须先把土壤中的盐分洗走，矿化的地下水排走，才能种植。像河套地区，就有因大水漫灌使土壤严重盐化的现象。当地农民的办法是，先用较大的水量洗盐，然后种植。这种办法是在没有排水设施的情况下不得已而运用的，后果当然不会太好。但我们的任务是要进一步钻研技术，在农民已有经验的基础上，扩大效果。可是现在有些地方并不是这样做，他们只单纯强调减低灌水数量。这样一来，水量不足以压盐，土壤中大量盐分上升，作物死苗现象严重。这就是没有认真研究农民经验和具体情况，也没有研究苏联文献的精神实质，只单纯控制水量，造成“因噎废食”。
    这些事实都告诉我们，要作到稳定的农业丰收，一方面要把农民的经验和先进科学结合起来研究利用，但更重要的是要充分认识自然条件。我国自然条件很复杂，黄河流域有它特有的土壤和自然条件，它同长江流域不同，同苏联也有差别。但自然有它总的运行规律，苏联先进经验仍可以作为借镜。问题在于要把先进的科学经验和我们的具体条件结合起来，发现农业生产上的限制因素，进而不断地加以克服，更有效地发展土壤肥力。苏联社会主义建设时期，在干旱、半干旱地区取得的一系列的成就，使我们有信心认识自然、改造自然，更有效地利用我们的土地资源，使华北大平原和黄河流域地区，更多更好地供给我们丰盛的棉粮。
