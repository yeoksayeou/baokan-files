Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, December 31st (delayed dispatch) Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice-Premier He Long, and their entourage concluded their ten-day visit to Pakistan and departed from Dhaka for India by plane at 9:00 AM on the 30th.

    Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy arrived at Premier Zhou Enlai's residence (the Governor's Mansion) before the Chinese guests left for the airport, accompanying Premier Zhou in a car through streets that were decorated festively and amidst cheering crowds to the airport.

    Present at Dhaka Airport to see them off were foreign diplomatic envoys residing in Dhaka, several ministers from the Pakistani central government, the Chief Minister of East Pakistan, ministers from various departments, and prominent figures from society. Premier Zhou Enlai reviewed the honor guard at the airport. After shaking hands with those who came to see him off, he walked to the podium accompanied by Prime Minister Suhrawardy. The Pakistani Prime Minister delivered a farewell speech, saying, "You have been with us in Pakistan for ten days, and during this time, you have been liked by each and every one of us." He said, "The world situation has certain confusions, and through frequent mutual consultations, I believe we will be able to help promote better understanding, contribute to easing world tensions, and contribute to world peace."

    Suhrawardy said, "During the discussions, we found nothing that would prevent us from closer ties, more commercial trade, and cultural exchanges. The nature of the differences between our two countries in dealing with our own problems and international issues is not such that we cannot approach each other. I hope that my visit to your country and your visit to our country will forever be a harbinger of beneficial friendship and cooperation for both of our countries."

    Prime Minister Suhrawardy expressed his hope that Premier Zhou Enlai would visit Pakistan again and stay longer.

On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, he expressed his sincere gratitude to the President, Prime Minister, central government, and provincial government of Pakistan, as well as the Pakistani people, for the warm welcome and hospitality he and his colleagues received during their visit. Premier Zhou said, "When we return to China, we will be very happy to convey the deep friendly feelings that the Pakistani people have for the Chinese people to the Chinese people."

    Premier Zhou mentioned his talks with Prime Minister Suhrawardy and other Pakistani leaders in Karachi, saying, "These talks were candid and conducive to enhancing our mutual understanding." Premier Zhou said, "As a result of the talks, Prime Minister Suhrawardy and I issued a joint statement in which we reaffirmed our desire to safeguard peace, ease international tensions, further strengthen the friendship between China and Pakistan, and further promote our mutual contacts in all aspects." Premier Zhou also said, "I believe that this contact and exchange of views between the leaders of our two countries is beneficial to both sides."

    Premier Zhou Enlai then mentioned his pleasant experiences visiting many important cities in Pakistan. He said, "Although our stays in these cities were each very short, the impressions we gained were very profound." He said, "Everything we saw and heard, as well as all the interactions, increased our understanding of your country and people, and further convinced us that the prospect of further developing the friendship between our two peoples is bright."

    苏拉瓦底说：“在讨论过程中，我们发现没有任何东西妨碍我们进行更密切的联系，进行更多的商业贸易和文化接触。在处理我们自己的问题和国际问题上，我们两国所存在的分歧的性质并不至于使我们不能接近。我希望，我对贵国的访问和你对我国的访问将是永远对于我们两国有益的友好和合作的预兆。”

    周总理提到他在卡拉奇同苏拉瓦底总理和巴基斯坦的其他领导人的会谈，他说：“这些会谈是开诚布公的，并且是有助于增进我们相互之间的了解的”。周总理说：“由于会谈的结果，苏拉瓦底总理阁下和我发表了一项联合声明，我们在声明中重申我们希望保障和平，缓和国际紧张局势，进一步加强中巴两国的友谊和进一步促进我们在各个方面的相互接触。”周总理还说：“我相信，我们两国领导人之间的这种接触和交换意见对于双方都是有好处的。”
    周恩来总理接着提到他在访问巴基斯坦许多重要城市时的愉快经历。他说：“虽然我们在这些城市中的逗留时间每次都很短，但是我们所获得的印象却是很深刻的。”他说：“我们所看到和听到的一切以及所有的交往都增进了我们对你们的国家和人民的了解，并且更使我们深信，进一步发展我们两国人民之间的友谊的前途是光明的。”
    周恩来总理的告别演说由东巴基斯坦政府的工商部部长、东巴基斯坦人民联盟总书记穆吉布尔·拉赫曼译成孟加拉语。周恩来总理然后在欢呼和鼓掌声中登上飞机启行。
