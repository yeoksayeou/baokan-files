    At the Mass Rally of Soviet and Chinese People's Friendship in the Kremlin
    Chairman Bulganin's Speech
    We are gathered here to welcome the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China – Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Comrade He Long, Vice Premier of the State Council, Comrade Wang Jiaxiang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, members of the delegation, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Comrade Liu Xiao, and all those accompanying them.
    Through our dear guests, we extend our heartfelt respect to the great Chinese people and their glorious Communist Party – the party leading the nation from victory to victory!
    We are gathered here also to hear what our Chinese comrades wish to say to us.
    The fraternal friendship between the Soviet Union and China is the greatest factor for peace and security of all nations, and an insurmountable obstacle to imperialist aggression.
    The friendship between the Soviet Union and China, the friendship between the Soviet people and the Chinese people, is growing stronger and more robust day by day, and our cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields is becoming increasingly effective. Our friendship, the friendship between two great socialist nations, is founded on the Leninist principles of equality, mutual respect for national interests, fraternal mutual assistance, non-interference in internal affairs, and deep loyalty to the cause of proletarian internationalism. The traditions of revolutionary struggle unite the Soviet and Chinese peoples, and the great ideals of Marxism-Leninism, the ideal of striving for the construction of communism, unite us.
    The fraternal friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is a historic and great achievement of the entire socialist camp, of the entire working humanity. This friendship is the greatest factor for the peace and security of all nations, and an insurmountable obstacle encountered by imperialists on the path of their aggressive policies. We are very pleased to welcome Comrade Zhou Enlai's statement upon his arrival in Moscow, "The friendship between our two peoples is eternal, inseparable, and unbreakable."
    The achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction have changed the entire political situation in Asia, and at the same time, have brought about a significant shift in the overall balance of power on the international stage.
    Under the leadership of their own Communist Party, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have made remarkable achievements in socialist construction. The formerly backward and oppressed by foreign imperialists, now independent, socialist China is becoming an industrial nation, a nation with a collective agricultural economy, and a nation with a highly developed culture and technology.
    We welcome the achievements of the Chinese people and wish them further and greater victories on the road of socialist construction.
    We know that the Chinese people are able to achieve success primarily due to the leadership of the great Communist Party, whose purpose is to serve the people wholeheartedly. The Chinese Communist Party, in accordance with the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, creatively embarked on solving the tasks facing the nation in political, social, economic, and cultural aspects after the victory of the people's revolution. The Chinese Communist Party boldly applied the experience of the countries in the socialist camp and enriched the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism on building socialism with its own experience.
    The victories and achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction have greatly changed the entire political situation in Asia and have greatly contributed to a series of countries in Asia achieving national independence. This has not only strengthened the front of peace but has also caused a significant shift in the overall balance of power on the international stage.
    The Soviet Union has consistently advocated the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and other international organizations, and supports the Chinese government's legitimate demands for the liberation of Taiwan and other occupied islands.
    All progressive people in the world rejoice in the achievements of the People's Republic of China. Only some people in capitalist countries dislike these achievements, and they use all means to try to hinder the Chinese people from building a peaceful and happy life.
    The United States and some countries that follow the United States continue to oppose the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, which not only puzzles all well-meaning people but also arouses their indignation.
    The Soviet Union has advocated in the past and will continue to advocate in the future the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and other international organizations. We are deeply convinced that restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations will strengthen the position of this organization and greatly enhance its prestige, because the policy of the People's Republic of China is a policy of peace, an extremely just and progressive policy, which reflects the will of 600 million people.
    The Soviet government has always supported the Chinese government's legitimate demands for the liberation of Taiwan and other Chinese territories that have been occupied. We are deeply convinced that justice will prevail in this regard and these territories will be reincorporated into the People's Republic of China.
    The government of People's China attaches great importance to consolidating peace in Asia and the Far East and has made great achievements in this regard. Comrade Zhou Enlai's recent visits to Southeast Asian countries such as India, Burma, Pakistan, Cambodia, and Vietnam have greatly helped to further consolidate mutual trust and friendship between China and its neighbors.
    The peaceful policy of the People's Republic of China is also reflected in its positive stance in safeguarding Egypt. Thanks to Egypt's heroic resistance, supported by the people of Arab countries and socialist countries and all peace-loving nations, the Anglo-French colonialists and Israel's aggression were defeated. The Chinese government, like the Soviet government and other peace-loving governments, has resolutely condemned the imperialist aggression against Egypt.
    Despite the complete failure of the aggression against Egypt, and despite the great victory of the forces of peace in the Middle East, peace-loving nations still have no reason to relax their efforts in the struggle for peace. The recent message from U.S. President Eisenhower to Congress regarding granting him special powers to use armed forces in the Middle East indicates that the United States has not ceased its policy of "cold war" and escalating international tensions.
    The U.S. President's message to Congress mentioned the threat of communism and the Soviet Union to the Arab people. This is nothing more than an attempt to justify one's own aggressive policies and intimidate the people of the Middle East. The groundlessness and absurdity of these slanders are obvious. Everyone knows very well that in our relations with other countries, we strictly abide by the principles of peaceful coexistence and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.
    "Eisenhower Doctrine" is a plan to carry out economic and political expansion in the Middle East by relying on military strength. This is a new form of colonialism, which American monopoly capitalists are trying to plant in places where they can squeeze out old-fashioned colonialists like British and French imperialists.
    The United States is attempting to use the economic difficulties of Arab countries to offer them "aid". There is no doubt that the people of the Middle East will understand what this so-called aid will bring them.
    We wish the people of the Middle East success in their struggle for their independence and for peace and security in the region.
    The Hungarian events are another warning to the entire working class and its parties that fierce class struggle still exists and that high revolutionary vigilance must be maintained.
    Comrades!
    The achievements of socialism are expanding day by day. However, it would be wrong to say that the construction of a new life is smooth and uneventful. We Marxists-Leninists recognize that the new is born in the struggle against the old, and the old will not voluntarily give up its position. The capitalist world, led by the United States, has spent a lot of energy and a lot of money trying to obstruct the victorious development of socialism. Every mistake we make, every wrong step we take, will be used by the imperialists to slander the great communist ideals, undermine the working class's confidence in their future, and weaken the strength and unity of the socialist camp.
    The counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary are a clear example of the fierce struggle between the two systems of capitalism and socialism under the conditions of the "cold war". Taking advantage of the major mistakes made by the past leaders of the Hungarian Working People's Party, the imperialists, using internal counter-revolutionary forces and their own spies in Hungary, provoked counter-revolutionary riots against the regime of the working class and laboring peasants and against the socialist fruits of Hungary. The counter-revolution attempted to restore the capitalist system and the fascist Horthy regime in Hungary.
    The imperialists' plan failed. The Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, headed by Comrade Kádár, consolidated the revolutionary forces. The Soviet Union's timely assistance to Hungary at the request of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government helped the Hungarian working people save their socialist achievements and spared Hungary from the threat of capitalist and fascist restoration.
    Supporting the Hungarian people in their struggle against counter-revolution to save socialism is our internationalist responsibility based on the principles of proletarian solidarity. In safeguarding socialism in Hungary, we realized that the issue was not only about saving the achievements of the Hungarian working people, but also about the fate of peace and the security of the people of other countries.
    We highly admire the clear and firm attitude of our Chinese friends on the issue of the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary. This attitude is completely consistent with the attitude of the Soviet Union.
    The Hungarian events are another warning to the entire working class and its parties and the entire worker's revolutionary movement that fierce class struggle still exists and that high revolutionary vigilance must be maintained. The enemy is watching us in places where we forget they still exist. We must not only build socialism, but also know how to protect it from enemy attacks from any direction.
    In order to achieve the common rise of the economy and culture of the socialist camp and to counter the destructive conspiracies of imperialism, it is necessary to further strengthen the unity, cooperation, and mutual assistance of socialist countries and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.
    Comrades!
    During the talks between the government delegations of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, we exchanged views on current international issues and the ways to further develop cooperation between our two countries.
    Our talks were conducted in a sincere, comradely, and mutually understanding atmosphere. The result of the exchange of views shows that our viewpoints are completely consistent, and we deeply understand our common tasks in the current situation.
    Our most important task at present is to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp with all our strength based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and to develop and strengthen friendship in accordance with the Leninist principles of equality as expounded in the Soviet government's declaration of October 30, 1956.
    Whether for the common rise of the economy and culture of the socialist camp, or for the successful counterattack against all attempts by imperialists to undermine the socialist forces, it is necessary to further strengthen the unity of socialist countries and the international solidarity of the proletariat. Under the current conditions, strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, combined with the broadest people's democracy implemented for the benefit of all working people, is of paramount importance to socialist countries.
    Building socialism under the circumstances of the "cold war" encounters many difficulties both politically and economically. In the talks with Chinese comrades, we affirmed that socialist countries should rely on their own strength and capabilities, and on the cooperation and mutual assistance of countries in the socialist camp, when overcoming the difficulties they face. This is the most correct and reliable path.
    We believe that despite shortcomings, despite the resistance of the crushed class enemies, and despite the sabotage activities of imperialist spies, the countries of the socialist camp are overcoming all difficulties and striving to achieve new and good results and greater achievements in economic construction and technological progress.
    We unanimously agreed that the friendship and cooperation of socialist countries creates favorable conditions for the peaceful coexistence of all countries.
    During the talks, both sides unanimously agreed that the friendship and cooperation of socialist countries creates favorable conditions for the peaceful coexistence of all countries, regardless of their socio-political systems.
    We agreed that we must continue our efforts to reach an agreement on disarmament by all possible means. The Soviet Union recently put forward proposals on reducing armed forces, banning the testing and use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, supervision, and aerial inspection, which creates a good basis for reaching an agreement with other countries.
    When we talked about the Far East issue, we expressed our belief that establishing and developing relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and Japan is in the interests of the Soviet Union and China, as well as in the vital interests of the Japanese people.
    Comrades!
    The government delegations of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union have done a significant and beneficial job. They have made a new contribution to strengthening and developing the friendly relations and cooperation between our two countries. We are deeply convinced that this will help to further strengthen the unity and strength of the socialist camp, promote the development of relations between socialist countries and all countries in the world on the basis of the principles of coexistence, and promote the unity of all peaceful forces in the struggle for peace and security of all nations.
    May the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples continue to grow and strengthen!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the Communist Party of China, the organizer and leader of socialist construction in China!
    Long live the great Chinese people!

    在克里姆林宫苏中两国人民友好群众大会上
    布尔加宁主席的讲话
    我们在这里开会，欢迎中华人民共和国政府代表团——中华人民共和国国务院总理兼外交部长周恩来同志、国务院副总理贺龙同志、外交部副部长王稼祥同志、代表团团员、特命全权大使刘晓同志和他们同行的全体人员。
    我们通过我们亲爱的客人们向伟大的中国人民和他们光荣的共产党——领导国家从胜利走向胜利的党——衷心致敬！
    我们在这里开会，还为了听取中国同志们想对我们说的话。
    苏中两国的兄弟友谊，是各国人民和平和安全的最伟大的因素，是帝国主义进行侵略的不可克服的障碍。　　苏联和中华人民共和国的友谊、苏联人民和中国人民的友谊在一天比一天巩固，一天比一天坚强，我们在政治、经济、文化各方面的合作也越来越有成效。我们的友谊、两个伟大社会主义国家的友谊是建立在平等、互相尊重民族利益、兄弟互助、互不干涉内政、深深忠于无产阶级国际主义事业这些列宁主义原则的基础上的。革命斗争的传统把苏联人民和中国人民团结在一起，马克思列宁主义的伟大理想、为建设共产主义而奋斗的理想把我们团结在一起。
    苏联和中华人民共和国的兄弟友谊是整个社会主义阵营、整个劳动人类的历史性的伟大成果。这种友谊是各国人民和平和安全的最伟大的因素，是帝国主义者在他们侵略政策道路上遇到的不可克服的障碍。我们十分满意地欢迎周恩来同志在到达莫斯科时说的这样一句话，“我们两国人民之间的友谊，是永恒的、不可分离的、牢不可破的。”
    中国人民在社会主义建设中的成就，改变了整个亚洲的政治局势，同时使国际舞台上总的力量对比发生了重大变化。
    中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的自己的共产党的领导下，在社会主义建设方面取得了卓越的成就。从前落后的和被外国帝国主义者压迫的，现在独立的、社会主义的中国正在成为工业国，成为集体农业经济的国家，成为文化和技术高度发达的国家。
    我们欢迎中国人民的成就，祝他们在社会主义建设的道路上进一步取得更大的胜利。
    我们知道，中国人民所以能取得成就，首先是由于伟大的共产党的领导，这个党的宗旨是全心全意地为人民服务。中国共产党遵照马克思列宁主义学说，创造性地着手解决人民革命胜利后国家在政治、社会、经济、文化各方面面临的任务。中国共产党人大胆地运用了社会主义阵营国家的经验，并且用自己的经验丰富了马克思列宁主义关于建设社会主义的学说。
    中国人民在社会主义建设中的胜利和成就，大大地改变了整个亚洲的政治局势，在极大的程度上有助于亚洲一系列的国家取得国家独立，这不仅加强了和平阵线，同时使国际舞台上总的力量对比发生了重大的变化。
    苏联一贯主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国和其他国际组织中的合法权利，支持中国政府关于解放台湾和其他被侵占的岛屿的合法要求。
    世界上一切进步的人们都为中华人民共和国的成就感到欢欣。只有资本主义国家某些人士不喜欢这些成就，他们使用一切手段企图阻碍中国人民建设和平幸福的生活。
    美国和某些追随美国的国家继续反对恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利，这不仅使一切善良人民感到不解，而且引起他们的愤慨。
    苏联过去主张将来仍然主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国和其他国际组织中的合法权利。我们深信，恢复中国在联合国的合法权利，将会加强这个组织的地位，大大地提高它的威信，因为中华人民共和国的政策是和平的政策，是极其公正而进步的政策，它反映着六亿人民的意志。
    苏联政府一向支持中国政府关于解放台湾和中国其他被侵占的岛屿的合法要求。我们深信，在这方面正义必将取得胜利，这些领土将重新归并于中华人民共和国。
    人民中国政府非常重视巩固亚洲和远东的和平，并且在这方面取得了很大成就。前不久周恩来同志访问了东南亚国家印度、缅甸、巴基斯坦、柬埔寨和越南，大大有助于进一步巩固中国和它的邻国之间的相互信任和友谊。
    中华人民共和国的和平政策还表现在它采取维护埃及的积极立场。由于埃及在阿拉伯各国人民以及社会主义国家和一切爱好和平国家的支持下的英勇反抗，英法殖民主义者和以色列的侵略行动被击破。中国政府也像苏联政府和其他爱好和平的国家政府一样，坚决谴责帝国主义者对埃及的侵略。
    尽管对埃及的侵略完全失败，尽管和平力量在中近东获得很大的胜利，爱好和平的各国人民仍旧没有理由放松为和平而斗争的努力。不久前美国总统艾森豪威尔向国会提出的关于赋予他在中近东使用武装力量的特别权利的咨文表明，美国没有停止“冷战”和加紧国际紧张局势的政策。
    美国总统致国会咨文讲到共产主义和苏联对阿拉伯人民的威胁。这不外是一种为自己的侵略政策辩解并恫吓中近东各国人民的企图而已。这些谰言的毫无根据和妄诞无稽是显而易见的。大家很清楚地知道，在同其他国家的关系中，我们严格地遵守和平共处和不干涉其他国家内政的原则。
    “艾森豪威尔主义”就是靠着军事力量在中近东实行经济扩张和政治扩张的计划。这是一种新形式的殖民主义，美国垄断资本家企图把它栽植到能够挤掉英法帝国主义者这样的旧式殖民主义者的地方。
    美国企图利用阿拉伯国家的经济困难提出给它们“援助”。无庸怀疑，中近东各国人民能弄明白这种所谓援助将给他们带来些什么。
    我们祝中近东各国人民在争取自己的独立和这一地区的和平和安全的斗争中获得成功。
    匈牙利事件再次警告全体工人阶级及其政党，激烈的阶级斗争还存在，必须保持高度革命警惕性。
    同志们！
    社会主义的成就在日渐扩大。但是，如果说新生活的建设是一帆风顺和平安无事的，那就错了。我们马克思列宁主义者认识到，新的东西是在同旧的东西进行斗争中诞生的，旧的东西不会自愿地让出阵地。以美国为首的资本主义世界花了很多气力，用了大量金钱想阻挠社会主义的胜利发展。我们每犯一个错误，每走错一步，都要被帝国主义者利用来诽谤伟大的共产主义思想，损害工人阶级对他们的前途的信心，削弱社会主义阵营的力量和团结。
    匈牙利的反革命暴动是表现资本主义和社会主义两种制度在“冷战”条件下激烈斗争的显明例子。帝国主义者乘匈牙利劳动人民党过去的领导犯了大错误的机会，利用匈牙利内部反革命势力和自己的间谍，在匈牙利挑起反对工人阶级和劳动农民的政权、反对匈牙利社会主义果实的反革命暴动。反革命企图在匈牙利恢复资本主义制度和法西斯霍尔蒂分子的政权。
    帝国主义者的计划遭到了失败。以卡达尔同志为首的匈牙利工农革命政府巩固了革命力量。苏联根据匈牙利工农革命政府的请求给予匈牙利的及时援助，帮助了匈牙利劳动人民拯救他们的社会主义成果，使匈牙利免受资本主义和法西斯主义复辟的威胁。
    支援匈牙利人民对反革命作斗争以拯救社会主义，是我们以无产阶级团结原则为基础的国际主义责任。在维护匈牙利社会主义的时候，我们意识到，问题不仅在于拯救匈牙利劳动人民的成果，而且关系到和平的命运和其他国家人民的安全。
    我们十分推崇中国朋友在匈牙利反革命暴乱问题上的明确和坚定的态度。这种态度同苏联的态度完全一致。
    匈牙利事件再次警告全体工人阶级及其政党和整个工人革命运动，激烈的阶级斗争还存在，必须保持高度革命警惕性，敌人在我们忘掉他们还存在的那些地方窥视着我们，不仅要建设社会主义，而且要会保护它，使它免受敌人来自任何方面的打击。
    为了社会主义阵营经济和文化的共同高涨和反击帝国主义的破坏阴谋，有必要进一步加强社会主义各国的团结、合作和互相帮助，加强无产阶级专政。
    同志们！
    在中华人民共和国和苏联两国政府代表团会谈期间，我们就当前国际问题和进一步发展我们两国合作的道路交换了意见。
    我们的会谈是在诚恳的同志式的相互了解的情况下进行的。交换意见的结果表明，我们的观点完全一致，我们深刻了解在现代局势下我们的共同任务。
    目前我们最重要的任务是：根据马克思列宁主义原则全力加强社会主义阵营的团结，本着苏联政府1956年10月30日的宣言中所阐述的列宁主义平等原则发展和加强友谊。
    无论为了社会主义阵营经济和文化的共同高涨，还是为了胜利地反击帝国主义者破坏社会主义力量的一切企图，都有必要进一步加强社会主义国家的团结和无产阶级的国际团结。在当前的条件下，加强为全体劳动人民的利益而实行的同最广泛的人民民主结合的无产阶级专政，对社会主义国家具有最重要的意义。
    在“冷战”形势下建设社会主义，无论在政治方面和经济方面都碰到许多困难。在同中国同志的会谈中，我们确认，社会主义国家在克服面临的困难时应当靠自己本身的力量和能力，靠社会主义阵营各国的合作和互相帮助。这是一条最正确最可靠的道路。
    我们相信，虽然有缺点，虽然被粉碎的阶级敌对分子在进行反抗，帝国主义间谍在进行破坏活动，但是社会主义阵营国家在克服一切困难，争取在经济建设和技术进步方面取得新的良好的结果和更大的成绩。
    我们一致认为：社会主义国家的友好和合作，为一切国家的和平共处创造了有利的条件。
    在会谈的时候双方一致认为：社会主义国家的友好和合作，为一切国家的和平共处（不问这些国家的社会政治制度如何）创造了有利的条件。
    我们同意，必须继续努力，用一切可能的办法来达成裁军协议。苏联最近曾经提出关于裁减武装部队、禁止试验和使用原子武器和氢武器、监督和空中视察的建议，这为同其他国家达成协议创造了良好的基础。
    我们在谈到远东问题时表示相信，苏联和中华人民共和国两国同日本建立关系和发展关系既符合苏联和中国的利益，也符合日本人民的切身利益。
    同志们！
    中华人民共和国政府代表团和苏联政府代表团做了一件重大的、有益的工作。为加强和发展我们两国间的友好关系和合作作出了新的贡献。我们深深地相信，这会有助于进一步加强社会主义阵营的团结和力量，会促进社会主义国家和世界各国在共处原则的基础上发展关系，会促进一切和平力量在争取各国人民和平和安全的斗争中的团结。
    祝苏中两国人民牢不可破的友谊不断成长和加强！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国社会主义建设的组织者和领导者中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
