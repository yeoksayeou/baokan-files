Oppose the United States' Illegal Interference in Korean Affairs Through the United Nations
On January 11, the Eleventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation of the United States and excluding the participation of representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the discussion, blatantly disregarded the opposition of many justice-upholding countries and unilaterally passed the illegal resolution of the General Assembly's Political Committee on the Korean issue. This resolution was originally proposed by the United States representative, and the United States reiterated in its proposal some so-called "basic principles" used to interfere in Korean affairs and obstruct the reasonable settlement of the Korean issue. It openly disregards the will of the Korean people and attempts to force Korea to conduct so-called "free elections under the supervision of the United Nations" in order to achieve the goal of "unifying" Korea "in the form of a representative government." This is actually an attempt to deprive the Korean people of their sacred and inviolable right to decide their own affairs and to allow the United Nations, as a belligerent party, to unilaterally resolve the Korean issue. Obviously, this is entirely an aggressive conspiracy by the United States to use the United Nations to interfere in Korea's internal affairs. Therefore, this not only does not help the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue but also seriously damages Korea's sovereignty and the interests of the Korean people. The Chinese people resolutely oppose this illegal resolution by the United Nations General Assemby.
The Chinese government and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have consistently made unremitting efforts for the peaceful reunification of Korea. However, these efforts by the Chinese and Korean governments have been met with obstruction and opposition mainly from the United States. As recently as 1956, the Chinese and Korean governments also suggested to the governments of countries on the United Nations Command side that a conference of relevant countries be convened to discuss issues such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea. However, the United States and other governments on the United Nations Command side rejected this proposal and further openly violated the Armistice Agreement, unilaterally announcing restrictions on the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's exercise of its supervisory functions in South Korea. Now, the United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation of the United States, has passed this illegal resolution, once again exposing the United States' conspiracy to use the United Nations to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea.
The Chinese people resolutely oppose the United States' use of the United Nations to illegally interfere in Korean affairs. As pointed out by Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in his statement on the 12th, the Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves. The United Nations has no right to deal with the Korean issue. Foreign Minister Nam Il solemnly declared: "The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will never recognize the United Nations General Assembly's resolution on the Korean issue, which was unilaterally discussed without the participation of representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in violation of the will of the Korean people, and illegally passed." The Chinese people fully support the just stand of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in upholding sovereignty and reasonably resolving the Korean issue.
We believe that the Korean issue should be reasonably resolved in accordance with the national interests of the Korean people and the interests of world peace and security. Convening a conference of relevant countries to discuss issues such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue will help the peaceful reunification of Korea and the easing of the international situation. The Chinese people will continue to work together with the Korean people and all peace-loving countries and people to achieve this goal.

    反对美国利用联合国非法干涉朝鲜的事务
    1月11日，联合国大会第十一届会议在美国的操纵和排斥朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加讨论的情况下，竟然不顾许多主持正义国家的反对，片面地通过了大会政治委员会关于朝鲜问题的非法决议。这项决议原是美国代表提出的，美国在它的提案中重申了用以干涉朝鲜事务和阻挠朝鲜问题合理解决的一些所谓“基本原则”。它公然无视朝鲜人民的意志，企图迫使朝鲜“在联合国的监督下”进行所谓“自由选举”，以达到“在代议制政府的形式下”来“统一”朝鲜的目的。这实际上就是要剥夺朝鲜人民决定自己事务的神圣不可侵犯的权利，而图谋由作为交战一方的联合国来独断地解决朝鲜问题。显然这完全是美国企图利用联合国来干涉朝鲜内政的侵略阴谋，因此，这不仅无助于朝鲜问题的和平解决，而且严重地破坏了朝鲜的主权和朝鲜人民的利益。中国人民坚决反对联合国大会这个非法决议。
    中国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府一贯为和平统一朝鲜而进行不断的努力。但是，中、朝两国政府的这种努力，却遭受到主要来自美国方面的阻挠和反对。就在1956年，中、朝两国政府还曾经向联合国军方面各国政府建议，要求召开有关国家会议来协商从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和和平统一朝鲜等问题。但是，美国和联合国军方面其它各国政府却拒绝了这个建议，而且还进一步公然破坏停战协定，片面宣布限制中立国监察委员会在南朝鲜行使其监督停战的职权。现在，联合国大会在美国的操纵下通过了这个非法决议，又一次暴露了美国利用联合国来阻挠朝鲜和平统一的阴谋。
    中国人民坚决反对美国利用联合国来非法干涉朝鲜的事务。正如朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日在12日声明中所指出的，朝鲜问题应该由朝鲜人民自己来解决。联合国是无权来处理朝鲜问题的。南日外务相严正地宣告：“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府决不承认在没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加的情况下，片面地进行讨论，违背朝鲜人民的意志，非法通过的联合国大会关于朝鲜问题的决议。”中国人民完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府坚持主权和合理解决朝鲜问题的正义立场。
    我们认为，朝鲜问题应该按照朝鲜人民的民族利益和全世界和平安全的利益来合理解决。召开有关国家会议来协商从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和和平解决朝鲜等问题，将有助于朝鲜的和平统一和国际局势的和缓。中国人民将同朝鲜人民及一切爱好和平的国家和人民在一起，为达到这一目的而继续努力。
