Widely Mobilize the Masses to Do a Good Job in Fire Prevention and Forest Protection
Dozens of Counties and Cities in Liaoning Province Had No Forest Fires Last Year

    (Our newspaper reports) The forest fire-free competition movement launched in the autumn of 1956 in Liaoning Province, which possesses over a million hectares of forest land, has achieved remarkable results. From the beginning of October to December 23, 1956, the number of forest fires in the province decreased by 73.1% compared to the autumn of 1955, the area of ​​damaged forest land decreased by 80.3%, and the loss of forest trees decreased by 73%, ensuring the safety of a large area of ​​forests. For example, Anshan City had five consecutive mountain fires in the autumn of 1955, but none occurred in the autumn of 1956. Fuxian County burned more than 5,000 saplings in the autumn of 1955, but completely eliminated forest fires in the autumn of 1956, and 42 cities and counties (banners) including Anshan, Huanren, and Kazuo, and 2,791 fire-free townships (accounting for 95% of the total number of townships in the province) emerged. The whole province has basically eliminated forest fires.
    The main reason for the reduction of forest fires in the autumn of 1956 was that most areas made strict arrangements through various meetings and various forms of publicity after entering the autumn fire prevention period. Leading cadres in key forest areas such as Qingyuan, Beizhen, Xinbin, Xiuyan, and Huanren counties also personally presided over meetings of relevant departments such as public security, justice, military service, culture, education, the Communist Youth League, and the Women's Federation, established forest fire prevention headquarters, and formulated work plans; each department had a clear division of labor and were responsible at each level. Agricultural cooperatives in forest areas also organized forest fire prevention teams accordingly. In townships such as Puhebao and Sidaohezi in Huanren County, wooden signs of "Forest Fire Prevention" were hung on the doors of every household. Haiqingdao Village, Dagushan Township, Jin County, Dalian City, used "dang" drums to publicize forest fire prevention to the masses. In this way, a mass forest fire prevention movement was formed, laying a good foundation for reducing forest fires. Strictly controlling fire sources according to different seasons and different situations, combined with mass production activities, is also one of the important reasons for reducing forest fires. For example, at the beginning of the autumn harvest in Xinbin County, it was estimated that farmers might cause fires due to smoking. Therefore, they focused on this source of fire and required farmers to adopt the method of "one person carrying fire for centralized smoking" when going to the fields for production or going into the mountains for sideline occupations, and proposed different smoking ranges according to different locations. In this way, not only was forest fire prevention work strengthened, but also the smoking habits of the masses were taken into account. (Zhang Yisheng)

    广泛发动群众做好防火护林工作
    辽宁几十个县市去年没有发生森林火灾
    本报讯　拥有百万余垧林地的辽宁省在1956年秋季开展的无森林火灾竞赛运动，已获得显著成效。从1956年10月初至12月23日为止，全省发生的林火次数比1955年秋季减少73.1％，林地被害面积减少80.3％，林木损失减少73％，保证了大面积森林安全。如鞍山市1955年秋连续发生五次山火，1956年秋一次也没有发生。复县1955年秋烧幼树五千余棵，1956年秋已完全杜绝了森林火灾，并出现了鞍山、桓仁、喀左等四十二个无森林火灾市县（旗）和二千七百九十一个无森林火灾乡（占全省总乡数95％），全省基本上杜绝了森林火灾。
    1956年秋所以能减少森林火灾，主要原因是进入秋季防火戒严期后，大部地区都通过各种会议和利用各种宣传形式，作了严密的布置。清原、北镇、新宾、岫岩、桓仁等重点林区县的领导干部，还亲自主持召集公安、司法、兵役、文化、教育、青年团、妇联等有关部门会议，成立了护林防火指挥部，并制定了工作计划；各部门明确分工，层层负责。林区的农业社也相应地组织了护林防火队。桓仁县普禾堡、四道河子等乡，家家门口挂上了“护林防火”木牌。旅大市金县大孤山乡海青岛村，利用“当”鼓，向群众宣传护林防火。这样，就形成了一个群众性的护林防火运动，为减少森林火灾，打下了良好的基础。根据不同季节、不同情况、结合群众生产活动严密控制火源，也是减少森林火灾的重要原因之一。如新宾县在秋收开始时，估计到农民可能因吸烟引起火灾，因而他们就针对这个火源，要求农民下地生产或入山搞副业，吸烟的时候采取“一人带火集中吸烟”的办法，并按不同地点，提出了不同吸烟的范围。这样，既加强了护林防火工作，也照顾了群众吸烟习惯。　（张艺生）
