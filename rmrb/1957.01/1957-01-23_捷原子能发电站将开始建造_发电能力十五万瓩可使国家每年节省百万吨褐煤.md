Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 22nd. "Red Right News" published on the 21st a statement by Czechoslovak Minister of Power Industry, Mr. Frashek, to a reporter from the newspaper regarding the construction plan for the atomic power plant.

Frashek said: Construction of the country's first atomic power plant, which is scheduled to be built in Slovakia, will begin this year and go into production at the end of 1960. The power plant will have a generating capacity of 150,000 kilowatts and will save the country approximately one million tons of brown coal annually.

Frashek said that the design work for the power plant will soon be completed. It is being carried out in the Soviet Union with the cooperation of Czechoslovak personnel.

When discussing Czechoslovakia's future development plans for the utilization of atomic energy, Frashek said that the second atomic power plant will go into production at the beginning of the third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965), and that other atomic power plants will be built subsequently. These power plants will be built in areas where conventional resources cannot meet the growing electricity needs, namely Slovakia and Moravia. By the end of the third Five-Year Plan, the generating capacity of newly built atomic power plants will account for at least a quarter of the total planned increase in generating capacity. By 1970, all of the increased electricity will be produced by atomic power plants.

Finally, he thanked the Soviet Union for its enormous assistance to Czechoslovakia in the peaceful utilization of atomic energy.

    捷原子能发电站将开始建造
    发电能力十五万瓩可使国家每年节省百万吨褐煤
    据新华社布拉格22日电“红色权利报”21日刊载了捷克斯洛伐克动力工业部部长弗拉沙克对这个报纸记者发表的有关原子能电力站建设计划的谈话。
    弗拉沙克说：预定在斯洛伐克兴建的全国第一座原子能发电站的建造工作将在今年开始，1960年年底投入生产。这座发电站的发电量将为十五万瓩，它每年将为国家节省大约一百万吨褐煤。
    弗拉沙克说，这个发电站的设计工作不久即将完成。它是在捷克斯洛伐克工作人员的合作下在苏联进行的。
    弗拉沙克在谈到捷克斯洛伐克利用原子能的将来发展计划的时候说，第二个原子能发电站将在第三个五年计划（1961年—1965年）初期投入生产，随后还将兴建其他一些原子能发电站。这些发电站将建造在通常的资源不能满足日益增长的电力需要的那些地区，即斯洛伐克和摩拉维亚地区。到第三个五年计划结束时，新建原子能发电站的发电量至少将占计划中规定增加的全部发电量的四分之一。在1970年，增加的全部电力将由原子能发电站生产。
    最后，他感谢苏联在和平利用原子能问题上给予捷克斯洛伐克的巨大帮助。
