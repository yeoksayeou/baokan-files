Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 10th. "Al-Gomhouria" published an editorial on the 9th written by Anwar Sadat, stating that the purpose of Eisenhower's Middle East plan "is to implement a policy even more insidious than anything British imperialism could have imagined." "The plan's sole implication is that the countries in this region should abandon their sovereignty in exchange for dollars."

The editorial said: If we believe recent American statements, then the recent Anglo-French aggression against Egypt and the Middle East should be seen as legitimate actions rather than criminal acts of aggression. According to the principle that the statement attempts to establish, unilateral actions by the United States using force should be considered normal solutions to international problems, even though this principle has been condemned by almost the entire world for applying the law of the jungle.

The editorial asked: When it has been shown that the Middle East is only subject to aggression by America's two allies—France and Britain—and by Israel, which has been able to survive and persist only because of the United States, why is the United States still trying to create a baseless impression of aggression out of thin air? According to the United States, this aggression is threatened by countries controlled by "world communism."

The editorial said: The only possible explanation is that the United States hopes to occupy the same position of arrogant dominance in this region as its allies, a position that is contrary to the will of the inhabitants of this region.

Cairo Radio pointed out on the evening of the 8th, while commenting on the Eisenhower Doctrine: "The defense of the Middle East should be guaranteed by the residents of this region."

The radio said: "Why did President Eisenhower refuse to use armed forces to stop the aggression of France, Britain, and Israel? Why is he now demanding the use of force to counter his so-called possible communist aggression?"

"Who gets to define the communist threat referred to by Eisenhower? Can Egypt buying weapons from all over the world (including the Soviet Union) to defend its sovereignty and independence be considered a communist threat? Can Soviet support for Arab nationalism be considered a communist threat?"

The radio concluded: "The fate of the Middle East cannot be decided by the United States or the Soviet Union or any other country; it can only be decided by the people of this region, who have come to understand their historical responsibility to save world peace."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th. The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today stating that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is not only an infringement upon the sovereignty and national interests of Arab countries, but also a huge threat to peace in the Middle East and the world.

The commentary pointed out that the goals pursued by the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Middle East are clearly: to revive the Cold War, intensify international tensions, interfere in the internal affairs of the countries in this region, suppress the national liberation movements in this region, and turn these countries into American colonies. However, the era of threatening, intimidating, and buying people with weapons and dollars is gone forever. The course of international events over the past year shows that the enemies of peace are doomed to fail in their conspiracies in the Middle East.

"Democratic Korea" pointed out in a commentary published on the same day that although the United States has replaced Britain and France, it is impossible for the United States to enslave the awakened people of the Middle East, who are supported by the people of the world, with a "policy of strength" and turn this region into a breeding ground for new wars.

### 用武力和美元奴役他国的时代过去了  埃及和朝鲜报纸抨击“艾森豪威尔主义”

    用武力和美元奴役他国的时代过去了
    埃及和朝鲜报纸抨击“艾森豪威尔主义”
    新华社开罗10日电　“共和国报”9日发表的安瓦尔·萨达特写的一篇社论说，艾森豪威尔的中东计划的目的“是要实行一个甚至比英帝国主义能够想像出来的任何东西更为阴险的政策”。“计划的唯一含意是，这个地区的国家应当放弃它们的主权来换取美元”。
    社论说：如果我们相信美国最近的声明，那么就应当把英法最近对埃及和中东的侵略看作是合法的行动而不是罪恶的侵略行为。根据声明试图确定的原则，美国使用武力的片面行动应当被认为是国际问题的正常的解决办法，尽管这个原则由于应用弱肉强食的法则而几乎受到全世界的谴责。
    社论问道：当已经表明中东只受到美国的两个盟国——法国和英国，以及由于美国才得以生存不灭的以色列所进行的侵略时，为什么美国还企图制造关于一种无中生有的侵略的毫无根据的印象呢？据美国说，这种侵略是“世界共产主义”所控制的国家威胁要进行的。
    社论说：唯一可能的解释是：美国希望占据同它的盟国在这个地区所占据的蛮横统治地位同样的地位，这种统治地位是违反这个地区的居民的意志的。
    开罗电台8日晚在评论艾森豪威尔主义的时候指出：“中东的防御应该由这个地区的居民来加以保证”。
    电台说：“为什么艾森豪威尔总统拒绝使用武装部队来制止法、英和以色列的侵略？为什么他现在要求使用武力来对付他所谓的可能的共产党侵略？”
    “谁来为艾森豪威尔所指的共产党威胁下定义呢？埃及从全世界（包括苏联在内）购买武器来保卫它的主权和独立能被认为构成了共产党威胁吗？苏联支持阿拉伯民族主义将被认为是共产党威胁吗？”
    电台最后说：“中东的命运不能由美国或苏联或任何其他国家来决定，它只能由这个地区的人民来决定，他们已经了解到他们的拯救世界和平的历史责任。”
    新华社平壤10日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表评论说，“艾森豪威尔主义”不仅是侵犯阿拉伯各国主权和民族利益，而且是对中近东和世界和平的巨大威胁。
    评论指出，“艾森豪威尔主义”在中近东追求的目的显然是：恢复冷战，加剧国际紧张局势，干涉这一区域的国家的内政，镇压这一区域的民族解放运动，把这些国家变成美国的殖民地。但是，用武器和美元威胁、恫吓和收买人民的时代已经一去不复返了。去年一年中的国际事件的经过说明：和平的敌人在中近东的阴谋注定要失败。
      “民主朝鲜报”在同一天发表的评论指出，尽管由美国代替了英、法，但是美国企图以“实力政策”奴役受到世界人民支持的、觉醒了的中近东地区的人民和把这一地区变成新战争的策源地，是不可能的。
