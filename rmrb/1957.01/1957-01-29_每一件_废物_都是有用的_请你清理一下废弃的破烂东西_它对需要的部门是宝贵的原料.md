    Every "Waste" is Useful
    Please Clean Up Discarded Junk; It is Valuable Raw Material for Departments in Need
    Xinhua News Agency, January 28th dispatch. Xinhua News Agency reporter Shao Quan reports: The person in charge of waste product operations in Beijing told reporters: "Establishing a system for regularly clearing discarded items is of great significance. Every piece of junk has its use. In our work, we have not yet discovered a single so-called truly useless item."
    The youth of the Central Nationalities Printing Factory recently spent seven days carrying out a "shock week" of searching for waste products, picking up more than 5,600 jin of metal, old wood, waste paper, broken shoes, and empty bottles from all corners of the factory. The waste lead alone can solve one-third of their raw material needs for this year. After hearing about this, people from the Beijing Waste Products Management Office and the Waste Material Management Department felt that this was a very meaningful action. If it were made a system, and all factories, enterprises, organizations, and schools could regularly conduct a major cleanup of broken and discarded items in their units, accumulating small amounts into large, it would be a considerable social wealth.
    Many waste products are discarded everywhere in society, such as scrap copper and iron, scraps of cloth, old cotton, worn-out shoes, broken glass, etc., all of which have certain uses. Fish scales can be boiled into glue, which is an important raw material for the printing and match industries; leftover bones from meals can be used to extract bone oil, bone glue, and glycerin, which can be used to make soap, candles, and cosmetics. There is a cheap and good quality "Reborn Socks" on the market, which are re-woven from broken socks that people throw away after washing and sorting. In the second half of last year, the Beijing Waste Products Management Office purchased 10 million yuan worth of discarded items. The vast majority of these items became production raw materials.
    However, the work of collecting and utilizing waste products has not yet attracted widespread attention in society. Some units are afraid of trouble or do not understand the use of discarded items, allowing a large number of usable discarded items to lie in every corner or even be thrown away with the garbage, resulting in many discarded items—including scrap iron, broken cotton and linen fabrics, broken glass, etc.—being in short supply to varying degrees, which has increased the difficulty for production units using waste products to lack raw materials.
    The staff of the Beijing Waste Products Management Office suggest that every enterprise, organization, and every family should clean up discarded items and supply them to departments in need. In this way, it can not only provide raw materials for some production departments, but also increase income, which is beneficial to the cleanliness and hygiene of various units.

    每一件“废物”都是有用的
    请你清理一下废弃的破烂东西　它对需要的部门是宝贵的原料
    新华社28日讯　新华社记者邵泉报道：北京市经营废品业务的负责人对记者说：“建立定期清理废弃品的制度有很大意义，每一件破烂东西都有它的用处，在我们工作中还没有发现一件所谓真正的废物。”
    中央民族印刷厂的青年最近用七天的时间，开展了搜拣废品的突击周，在工厂的各个角落拣出了五千六百多斤金属、旧木料、废纸、破鞋和空瓶子等杂物。其中仅废铅一项，就可以解决他们今年所需原料的三分之一。北京市废品经营处和废弃品经理部的人听到这件事以后，认为这是一种很有意义的行动。如果把它作为一种制度，所有的工厂、企业、机关团体和学校都能定期对本单位的破烂废品进行一次大清理，积少成多，将是一笔极可观的社会财富。
    社会上到处抛弃着许多废品，如破铜烂铁、碎布、旧棉、穿烂了的鞋子、打碎了的玻璃等等，都有一定的用途。鱼鳞能熬胶，是印刷、火柴工业的重要原料；饭后的残骨能够提炼骨油、骨胶和甘油，可以用它做肥皂、蜡烛和化妆品。市场上有一种价廉物美的“更生袜”，是用人们抛掉的破袜子经过洗涤、整理重新织成的。去年下半年，北京市废品经营处就收购了价值一千万元的废弃品。这些东西绝大部分成了生产原料。
    但是，搜集和利用废品的工作远没有引起社会上广泛的注意。有些单位怕麻烦或者不了解废弃品的用途，让大量可以利用的废弃品躺在各个角落里甚至随着垃圾丢掉了，以致许多废弃品——包括废铁、破棉麻织品、碎玻璃等都在不同程度上脱销了，增加了使用废品的生产单位缺乏原料的困难。
    北京市废品经营处的工作人员建议，每个企业、机关，每个家庭都来清理废弃的东西，供给需要的部门。这样，不仅能给一些生产部门提供原料，还可以增加收入，有利于各单位的清洁卫生。
