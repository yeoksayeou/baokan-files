    Rescuing Dispersed Cultural Relics from Longquan
    Chen Qiu
    The destruction of three ancient pagodas in Longquan, Zhejiang, and the burning of a large number of ancient scriptures stored within them, has aroused great indignation and attention from all quarters after being disclosed in the newspapers. Currently, the Longquan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has conducted self-criticism and a review, and has carried out preliminary collection work on the salvaged cultural relics.
    Recently, the Buddhist Association of China received two pieces of burned and damaged scriptures from Chongyin Temple sent by six Buddhists including De Shou from Longquan County: one is a fragment of a hand-written scripture scroll, 224 cm long and 33.85 cm high; the other is a fragment of a carved scripture scroll, 36 cm long and 29.5 cm high, unfortunately, both have been destroyed, resulting in incompleteness. According to expert research, the handwritten scripture fragment is at least a manuscript from the Northern Song Dynasty, and the carved scripture was printed between the Five Dynasties and the Northern Song Dynasty. This kind of long scroll carved scripture is extremely rare among extant ancient scriptures. The pagodas originally contained hundreds of ancient scripture scrolls, making this the second major discovery after the Dunhuang sutras, but unfortunately, most of them have been burned.
    After seeing the newspaper reports about the demolition of ancient pagodas, De Shou and others recognized the importance of protecting cultural relics, and sent the two fragments they had picked up to Beijing, expressing their willingness to continue searching. This is commendable. It is hoped that more people will emulate their spirit of rescuing cultural relics for the nation, actively search for the remaining burned scriptures and other dispersed cultural relics, and dedicate them to the country, so that they can play their due role as historical and cultural materials.

    抢救龙泉流散文物
    陈秋
    浙江龙泉三座古塔被毁，塔内所藏大量古经被焚，这个事件经报纸披露后，引起了各方面很大的愤慨和注意。目前，中共龙泉县委已经作了检查和检讨，并且对劫余文物作了初步的收集工作。
    最近，中国佛教协会收到了龙泉县佛教徒德寿等六人寄来崇因寺焚余残经两件：一为写经长卷残段，长二百二十四公分，高三十三点八五公分；另为刻经残卷一段，长三十六公分，高二十九点五公分，惜均已被毁，以致残阙。据专家研究，写经残卷至迟是北宋时代的写本，刻经为五代至北宋期间刻印，这种长卷刻经是现在传世古经中极少见的。塔中原来保存古经卷有数百件之多，因此，这是继敦煌藏经发现后的第二次大发现，但可惜大部分已被焚毁掉。
    德寿等人看到了报载拆毁古塔的报道，认识到保护文物的重要意义，便把拾得的这两件残卷寄到北京，并表示还愿继续搜寻，这是值得表扬的。希望有更多的人效法他们这种抢救文物公诸国家的精神，积极搜寻焚余经卷和其他流散文物，并将它们献出来，以使它们发挥历史文化资料的应有作用。
