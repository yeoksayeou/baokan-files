    The Troubles of a Shadow Puppet Artist
    Lu Jingda is a well-known shadow puppet artist in Beijing. He has been learning shadow puppetry from his father since he was eight years old, and has deep attainments in the art of shadow puppet modeling, performance, music, and scripts. However, for a long time, he has transformed from a shadow puppet artist into a handicraftsman. In 1952, he was invited by the Central Academy of Fine Arts from the Beijing Deshun Shadow Puppet Troupe to participate in the academy's shadow puppet research work. Up to now, he has been transferred several times. First at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, then to the Fine Arts Service Department of the Chinese Artists Association, then back to the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and recently, to the Art Store. For several years, he has been carving leather puppets for various domestic and foreign exhibitions and foreign guests from various countries. He sits in his product workshop all day long, with no one to "research" with him, and no students to "learn" from him. He is isolated from his troupe and his apprentices.
    Lu Jingda has repeatedly raised his work issues to the leaders of these units, but they have not been resolved. Before liberation, he had plans to reform, reorganize, and develop shadow puppetry, but he was unable to realize them. After liberation, he also expressed this desire and raised this plan to the relevant leaders, but he did not receive the support and attention of the leadership.
    This situation should be changed.

    皮影艺术家的苦恼
    路景达是北京有名的皮影艺术家。由八岁起，他跟着父亲学皮影，对皮影的造型、演技、音乐、剧本等方面都有很深的造诣。但是长期以来，他却由一个皮影艺术家变成一个手工业工人了。1952年，他被中央美术学院由北京德顺皮影剧社请到院内，参加院内的皮影研究工作。到现在，前后调动了好几次工作。先在中央美术学院，后转到中国美术家协会美术服务部，又回到中央美术学院，最近，又调到美术商店。几年来，他一直在为各种国内外的展览会、各个国家的外宾刻皮人。他成天坐在自己的产品作坊里，没有人来和他“研究”，也没有学生跟他“学习”。他和自己的剧社、自己的徒弟隔绝了。
    路景达曾就自己的工作问题，向这些单位的领导上多次地提过意见，但是一直未得到解决。解放前，他就有过改革、整理和发展皮影戏的计划，但是未能实现。解放以后，他也曾向有关领导方面表示过这种意愿，提起过这种计划，但是也未得到领导上的支持和重视。
    这种情况是应该加以改变了。
