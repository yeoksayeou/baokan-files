    Reactions to Criticism

    Taking advantage of local industry is wrong.
    A letter from the Supply Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building: After the People's Daily published the article "Don't Take Advantage of Local Industry" on December 15, 1956, we immediately conducted an inspection. We believe that it is appropriate to negotiate and stipulate a reasonable price difference based on the difference in the use value of steel plate scraps and waste steel. However, the price difference was too high in the past, and the Shenyang Supply Office further increased the price difference during specific implementation, which was wrong. We sincerely accept the reader's opinions and plan to notify relevant units to pay attention to this in future work and avoid similar incidents.

          Overcoming Subjectivism
    A letter from the Changchun Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau: The criticism of our bureau in the People's Daily's "Built It and Tore It Down" published on December 21, 1956, is correct. In the future, we must resolutely overcome our subjectivism and bureaucratism in our ideology and work style.

    对批评的反应
    揩地方工业的油是不对的
    第一机械工业部供应局来信：人民日报1956年12月15日发表了“不要揩地方工业的油”一文后，我们随即进行了检查，我们认为根据钢板边料和废钢在使用价值上的差异，双方协商规定适当的差价是合适的。但过去差价过高，沈阳供应办事处在具体执行时把差价又提高一步，这是不应该的。我们诚恳的接受读者意见，准备通知有关单位在今后工作中注意，避免类似事情发生。
          克服主观主义
    长春市建筑工程局来信：人民日报1956年12月21日刊登了“盖起来又拆掉”对我局的批评是正确的。今后我们要坚决地克服自己在思想作风上的主观主义和官僚主义。
