Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 3rd: Shanghai held a grand gathering today to comfort the families of workers who have been transferred to other locations to support construction. Shanghai Vice Mayor Song Richang expressed his gratitude to the families. Workers' family members Feng Jinying and Wang Qinfang, and Shanghai youth Pan Jinpei, who had just come to Shanghai from Gansu Province to visit relatives, spoke at the meeting.

In recent years, more than 200,000 workers and young people from Shanghai have gone to other places to support construction. Shanghai workers are working selflessly at important construction posts such as the First Automobile Factory, Yumen Oil Mine, Karamay Oil Area, and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. More than two thousand female workers who were transferred to the Xi'an Cotton Textile Factory last May have recently had one hundred and two of them named as advanced workers in the factory.

The meeting also passed two letters of慰问 (wèiwèn letters of sympathy and solicitude), one addressed to the workers participating in construction in other places, and the other to the workers' families remaining in Shanghai.

    慰问支援建设的职工家属
    据新华社上海3日电　上海市今天举行盛大集会，慰问调到外地支援建设的职工家属。上海市副市长宋日昌向家属们表示感谢。职工家属冯金英和王琴芳和刚从甘肃省来上海探亲的上海青年潘金培都在会上讲了话。
    几年来，上海已经有二十多万职工和青年到外地支援建设，在第一汽车厂、玉门油矿、克拉玛依油区、兰新铁路等重要建设岗位上，都有上海去的职工在忘我地劳动着。去年5月间调到西安棉纺织厂的二千多名女工，最近已经有一百零二人被评为厂里的先进工作者。
    会上还通过了两封慰问信，一封是写给在外地参加建设的职工，另一封是写给留在上海市的职工家属。
