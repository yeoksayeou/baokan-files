    A Frugal Revolutionary Old Couple
    Xu Letian
    Stepping into the bedroom of Senior Colonel Liu Zhidi, head of the Medical Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy Health Department, and his wife, Senior Major Yuan Yimin, one can see how this revolutionary old couple lives frugally. The printed bedsheets on their bed are faded with age, almost turning white. The military blanket underneath the bedsheet is almost worn smooth. This military blanket was a trophy seized during the liberation of Changchun in 1948 and has been used for over eight years. Besides a canvas box and a small leather suitcase, they also use a large wooden box and a large cigarette box to store things. A mended khaki wool military uniform is the casual wear worn by Senior Colonel Liu Zhidi on holidays.
    When they got married in Yan'an, they lived in a cave dwelling, ate millet, and wore straw sandals made by themselves. In 1942, they both worked in the Eighth Route Army hospital in Yan'an. Liu Zhidi was a pediatrician, and Yuan Yimin was an internist. They often treated the villagers regardless of day or night. As soon as Dr. Liu heard that a villager's child was sick, he would put down his chopsticks and leave; sometimes he would get up and make house calls in the middle of the night. Everyone within a twenty-mile radius of Yan'an knew that there was a Dr. Liu in the Eighth Route Army hospital. At that time, the troops launched a labor production campaign to reduce the burden on the people. In addition to seeing patients, they also reclaimed wasteland and farmed together, and spun cotton together. Liu Zhidi remembers a saying that was circulating in the army at that time: "If the villagers eat chaff, we eat chaff; we must share the joys and sorrows with the people." He said that even though more than ten years have passed, he has never forgotten this sentence.
    This revolutionary old couple has maintained the habit of hard work and plain living for a long time. Now, although their monthly income is not small, they never spend money extravagantly. Yuan Yimin has been wearing a pair of wool trousers for eight or nine years, with several patches on them. She said, "If you mend it, it will still keep you warm." They are very frugal with money, but they are not stingy with the money that should be spent. Last year, when purchasing public bonds and donating money to build a tractor station, the two of them took out a total of 1,100 yuan.
    Yuan Yimin is the director of a clinic in the Navy. Sometimes, when the nurses in the clinic are sick, she always runs over to ask about their condition with great concern, and even cooks porridge and makes side dishes in her own home to send to them. The nurses jokingly said, "When others are sick, we act as nurses; when we are sick, the director acts as a nurse." Every time Liu Zhidi goes down to the troops to inspect work, he always eats and lives with the assistants, and walks with them, never asking for a car to pick him up.
    They have two children, the older boy is in middle school, and the younger girl is in elementary school. They often tell their children stories of hard struggle during the war years. On holidays, they take their children to the countryside, where they tell them stories of farmers' hard work, teaching them that the happiness of life is created by labor. As a result, the children also help with sweeping the floor and wiping the table when they return home from school. Most of the clothes worn by the older child are made from old military uniforms. They never allow their children to spend money recklessly. Once, the father received a "report" from the older child, which read: "In order to make it easier to go to school and avoid walking, I want to buy a bicycle. This is submitted for the father's approval." After reading the "report," the father called the older child over. He didn't mention buying a bicycle to the child, but only talked about how he marched more than a hundred miles a day during the war, how he felt his way in the dark, and how he climbed mountains and crossed rivers in the freezing weather, and also talked about the benefits of walking for physical exercise. After listening, the older child quietly took back the "report." Later, whenever the little girl clamored to buy this or that, the older child would take the little sister's hand and say, "Come, I'll tell you a story about Dad marching and fighting, to cure the hedonistic thoughts in your little head."

    一对俭朴的革命老伴侣
    徐乐天
    走进中国人民解放军海军卫生部医疗处长刘智弟上校和他的爱人袁益民少校的卧室，就可以看到这一对革命老伴侣是怎样俭朴地生活的。他们的床上铺的印花被单，年久退色，几乎变成白色的了。被单下面铺着的一条军毯，差不多已经磨成了光板。这条军毯还是1948年解放长春的时候缴获的战利品，至今已用了八年多。床边除了一只帆布箱和一只小皮箱以外，还用一只大木箱和一只大香烟盒装着东西。一件打了补绽的草黄色呢军服，是刘智弟上校在假日里穿的便衣。
    他俩在延安结婚的时候，住的是窑洞，吃的是小米，穿的是自己亲手做的草鞋。1942年，他俩都在延安八路军的医院里工作。刘智弟是小儿科的医生，袁益民是内科医生，他俩经常不分白天黑夜地给老乡们治病。刘医生只要一听说老乡的孩子有病，放下碗筷就走；有时半夜三更也起床出诊。延安周围二十来里地，谁都知道八路军的医院里有个刘医生。那时候，部队为了减轻人民的负担，开展了劳动生产。他俩除了诊病，还一起开荒种地，一起纺棉花。刘智弟记得当时部队里留传着这样一句话：“老乡吃糠咱吃糠，要和人民共患难。”他说，时间过去十几年了，这句话我一直没有忘记。
    这一对革命老伴侣长期保持了艰苦朴素的生活习惯。现在，他俩每月的收入虽然不算少，但是从来不大手大脚地花钱。袁益民身上的一条毛裤已经穿了八、九年，上面有了好几个补绽。她说：“补一补，还不是照样暖和。”他们用钱很节俭，可是该用的钱却一点不吝啬，去年购买公债和捐款筹建拖拉机站的时候，两人一共拿出了一千一百元。
    袁益民是海军部队里的一个门诊所的主任，有时候所里的护士病了，她总是十分关心地跑去问长问短，还在自己家里给他们熬了稀饭，做些小菜送去。护士们打趣地说：“别人病了，我们当护士；我们病了，主任给当护士。”刘智弟每次下部队检查工作，总是和助理员们一起吃，一起住，一道走路，从来不要汽车接送。
    他俩有两个孩子，大的男孩在中学念书，小女孩在小学念书。他们常常向孩子们讲战争年代艰苦奋斗的故事。在假日，他们带着孩子到野外，就给孩子们讲农民辛勤劳动的故事，教孩子们懂得生活的幸福是劳动创造出来的。于是，孩子放学回家也会帮着扫扫地，揩揩桌子。大孩子穿的衣服，大部分是用旧军装改的。他们从来不允许孩子乱花钱。有一次，爸爸收到了大孩子的一份“报告”，上面写道：“为了上学方便，不用走路，我想买辆自行车，此呈爸爸批准。”爸爸看完了“报告”，就把大孩子找来。他跟孩子没提买自行车的事，只对他谈过去打仗的时候每天行军一百多里，怎样在黑夜里摸着道走，怎样在冰天雪地里爬山过河，又谈到走路对锻炼身体的好处。大孩子听完之后，就悄悄地把那个“报告”收回去了。后来，每当小姑娘吵着嚷着要买这买那的时候，大孩子就会拉着小妹妹的手说：“来，我讲个爸爸行军打仗的故事给你听听，治治你这小脑袋里的享乐思想。”
