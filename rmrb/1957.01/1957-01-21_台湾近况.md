Taiwan Situation

　　Madmen in Droves
　　Taiwan newspapers say that Taiwan is "full of madmen." In Luzhou Township, Taipei County alone, there are more than 50 madmen. Some of them wander around, often being bound and beaten by Taiwanese police. Guo Huan, a mad woman living in Luzhou Township, has been detained by the Taipei police seven times and is covered in injuries from beatings.

　　These people have gone mad because they cannot bear the torment of life and their nerves have been excessively stimulated. Huang Liyi, a 27-year-old youth living in Keelung, went mad because he suffered from a serious heart disease and had no money for treatment, causing him to be depressed for a long time. He has attempted suicide by drowning several times but failed, and has recently gone missing.

　　The Poor on the Firing Range
　　In the Zhuoshui River area of Taiwan, there is the largest artillery range of the Chiang army. The poor people living in that area risk their lives to make a living by "collecting shrapnel" to sell for money.

　　Taiwan newspapers say that whenever the Chiang army shells this range, hundreds and thousands of people, carrying cattail bags, roll and crawl in the smoke, chasing and picking up fragments after the "blooming." The newspapers say that in recent years, nearly a thousand people have been innocently killed or injured by the Chiang army's artillery fire on this firing range because of "collecting shrapnel."

　　Beggars, Beggars
　　As the year draws to a close, countless poor people in Taiwan are wandering the streets begging. According to Taiwan newspaper reports, a beggar named Jian Jinlong, who lives in Neihu Township, Taipei County, recently died on the roadside while begging because he had no cotton clothes and was often hungry and cold.

　　According to Taiwan newspaper reports, the number of poor people in Taichung County urgently awaiting relief is more than 120,000, while the total population of the county is more than 530,000, meaning that approximately one in four people needs relief.

　　Farmers Lack Draft Cattle
　　Taiwan newspapers say that Taiwan "lacks draft cattle everywhere," and many farming families are "full of complaints." Many poor farmers use manpower to replace draft cattle, pulling heavy wooden plows to cultivate the fields.

　　Taiwan newspapers say that the main reason for the lack of draft cattle is the Chiang Kai-shek clique's taxation and extortion, making it impossible for the majority of farmers to afford or raise draft cattle. In Taoyuan County, more than 2,000 draft cattle fell ill and died one after another due to the lack of feed and cattle sheds.

　　The Taiwan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry recently launched a so-called "general inspection of cattle and horses," forcing farmers to "register" their cattle and horses so that they can be incorporated into the "wartime transport team" or slaughtered for the Chiang army at any time. News reports say that at the Taiwan Livestock Production Conference, it was stipulated that Taiwan farmers must supply more than 6,500 so-called "old and useless cattle" to the Chiang army for slaughter this year.

    台湾近况
    疯人成群
    台湾报纸说，台湾“疯人成群”。仅在台北县芦洲镇就有疯子五十多人，他们有的在外流浪，常常受到台湾警察的捆押和殴打。家住在芦洲镇的疯女郭换，曾经先后被台北警察机关扣押过七次，被打得满身都是伤痕。
    这些人都是因为受不了生活折磨，神经受到过分刺激而发疯的。家住在基隆的二十七岁的青年黄礼仪，因为患着严重的心脏病无钱医治，长期心情忧郁而发疯，他曾几次投河自杀未遂，最近外出失踪。
    靶场上的贫民
    在台湾濁水溪地区有一个蒋军最大的炮兵靶场，在那一带居住的贫民，不顾生命危险，靠着“捡弹片”来卖钱过活。
    台湾报纸说，每当蒋军炮击这个靶场的时候，有成千成百的人，手里提着蒲草袋，在硝烟中乱滚乱爬，追逐捡拾“开花”后的零弹片。报纸说，近年以来，在这个靶场上，因为“捡弹片”而被蒋军炮火无辜杀伤的将近一千人。
    乞丐，乞丐
    年关岁暮，台湾有无数的贫民流落在街头行乞。据台湾报纸消息，一个家住台北县内湖乡的乞丐简金龙，最近在外行乞，因为身上没有棉衣，经常挨饿受冻而死在路旁。
    又据台湾报纸报道，目前台中县急待赈济的贫民人数达十二万多人，而全县人口总数是五十三万多人，大约每四个人中，就有一个人需要赈济。
    农民缺耕牛
    台湾报纸说，台湾“到处耕牛少”，许多农家“怨声高”。有许多贫苦农民都以人力来代替耕牛，他们拉着笨重的木犁在田里耕种。
    台湾报纸说，耕牛缺乏的主要原因是蒋介石集团的捐税压榨，广大农民买不起也养不起耕牛。桃园县农民因为没有草料和牛棚，以致两千多头耕牛生病，纷纷死亡。
    台湾农林厅最近还发动所谓“牛马总检查”，强迫农民进行牛马“登记”，以便随时把牛马编入“战勤运输队”或给蒋军屠宰。消息说，在台湾畜产会议上，规定台湾农民在今年内要供应六千五百多头所谓“老废牛”给蒋军屠宰。　（新华社讯）
