The first year after agricultural cooperativization in Liaoning Province has passed.

Some people ask: Is cooperativization actually good or bad? Is the increase in agricultural production real or fake? Is the increase mainly due to favorable weather, or due to cooperativization? If cooperativization is good, why do farmers still have so many dissatisfactions and complaints? Here, I will discuss these questions based on the basic situation of Liaoning Province in the year after agricultural cooperativization.

Liaoning Province achieved agricultural cooperativization before the spring plowing of 1956. The number of peasant households joining cooperatives accounted for 98.6% of the total number of peasant households in the province, of which 92.8% joined advanced cooperatives. Over the past year, according to the correct and timely instructions of the Central Government, leading cadres at all levels have specifically helped agricultural cooperatives to carry out a series of tasks: tapping production increase potential and formulating production plans; continuously improving the operation and management of cooperatives; vigorously promoting various production increase measures and technological reforms; implementing the principles of diligence and thrift in running cooperatives and democratic management; and correctly resolving the issue of income distribution in cooperatives. The direction of rural work over the past year has been completely correct. Cadres and the masses have been very excited and active.

Relying on the superiority of the cooperative system and the enthusiasm of the peasant masses, along with normal weather conditions, Liaoning Province achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in agricultural production in 1956. Grain production increased by 23.3% on the basis of the bumper harvest in 1955, with a total output of 7.6 million tons, exceeding the original state plan production target for 1957 by 19.3%. Cotton production reached 68,000 tons, doubling the output of 1955, and also fulfilling the 1957 plan target one year ahead of schedule. In addition, Liaoning Province's famous specialties such as tussah silkworm cocoons, apples, and flue-cured tobacco also had bumper harvests. More than 85% of the cooperatives in the province increased production to varying degrees, and more than 80% of the members increased their income.

Although these statistics are not yet very precise, there is no doubt that a substantial increase in production has been achieved. To support disaster areas, the province purchased several hundred thousand tons of grain in addition to the grain fixed quota, and most rural areas still have ample grain reserves, and the purchasing power of farmers has greatly increased. If it were not for the bumper harvest, how could purchasing power have increased? Those who see the reduction in production and poor harvests in some local areas and certain agricultural cooperatives and mistakenly believe that it is a province-wide problem and therefore doubt the production increase in 1956 can only be said to "see the trees but not the forest."

Currently, there is also an argument that the main reason for the increase in agricultural production in 1956 was favorable weather, and it cannot be attributed to agricultural cooperativization. It is undeniable that normal weather conditions were extremely favorable conditions for agricultural production in 1956; however, without cooperativization, such a large increase in production would not have been possible. In 1955, the weather in Liaoning Province was also relatively normal, but the total grain output that year was not 7.6 million tons, but only 6.15 million tons. How should this be explained?

In terms of the entire province, in addition to normal weather conditions, the main measures taken to increase production in 1956 were:

	1.	Vigorously develop farmland water conservancy. The newly cultivated paddy field area in the province reached 180,000 hectares, equivalent to one and a half times the total area of paddy fields developed in the past few decades. This alone could increase grain production by more than 300,000 tons; and changed the situation of unstable yields in some areas over the years.
	2.	Increase the application of manure fertilizer. After cooperativization, a manure accumulation campaign was universally launched, and various methods were adopted to tap fertilizer sources. The fertilizer application area increased by more than 15% compared with previous years, and the amount of fertilizer applied per unit area increased significantly. Farmers generally reported that the crops last year were strong and the grains were full, which was the result of high soil fertility.
	3.	Promote high-yield crops. The planting area of corn and tubers in the province, in addition to rice, expanded by more than 400,000 hectares, which alone increased grain production by hundreds of thousands of tons compared with previous years.
	4.	Improve farming techniques. Improved varieties of various grains were promoted on 900,000 hectares of land; the area of land ploughed by tractors and new farm implements increased nine times compared with the past; the area of "intercropping" and "relay cropping" reached 170,000 hectares; and square double-plant planting of corn, straight-row rice transplanting, and new cotton pruning methods were promoted. All those who adopted these technical measures in accordance with local conditions achieved varying degrees of production increase, and many new high-yield records appeared.
	5.	Reclaiming wasteland and eliminating boundary corners expanded the cultivated land area by 150,000 hectares, increasing grain production.
	6.	Cooperativization greatly enhanced the ability to resist disasters. Various localities built drainage and irrigation projects, reducing the threat of waterlogging to 200,000 hectares of land. Soil and water conservation projects played a major role in controlling soil erosion in mountainous areas and protecting farmland. After the beginning of summer, many areas experienced serious insect pests, and in some areas, continuous rain and lush weeds also required the large workforce of cooperatives to overcome seedling shortages and insect pests and protect seedlings. At that time, farmers in Beizhen County alone caught more than 200,000 catties of scarab beetles.

The above facts show that only by realizing cooperativization and concentrating the manpower, materials, and financial resources in rural areas is it possible to carry out many things that individual farmers dare not imagine.

Based on the above facts, we should draw such a clear conclusion: cooperativization is the only correct path for the vast number of farmers to develop production and increase income. Last year, so many cooperatives were established, and generally speaking, they were successful. The main sign of success is that they increased production and increased farmers' income.

Then, why are there still many bad phenomena? For example: about 15% of the agricultural cooperatives in the province failed to increase production or reduced production; about 20% of the peasant households did not increase income or reduced income; aquatic products, vegetables, and live pigs failed to increase production or even reduced production; livestock deaths occurred very commonly and seriously; agricultural production increased, but the supply of materials needed for the lives of urban and rural people felt much inconvenience and insufficiency, etc., what is going on?

To answer these questions, we must first draw a line, that is: although most of these phenomena occurred after cooperativization, we must never attribute them to the cooperative system, but only look for the reasons from the shortcomings and errors in our work. As the article "Once More on the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" said: "The system is decisive, but the system itself is not omnipotent. No matter how good the system is, it cannot guarantee that serious errors will not occur in the work."

Over the past year, in leading production and running cooperatives, while making many achievements, we have indeed had many shortcomings and errors.

For example, when formulating production plans last spring, we initially underestimated the possibility of increased production after cooperativization, and therefore had right-leaning conservative thinking; but after criticizing conservative thinking, we overestimated the favorable factors after cooperativization and ignored difficult conditions, and therefore developed hasty and rash emotions. The big targets were initially proposed by the lower levels, but they were approved by the province, and then they were increased layer by layer, and some even proposed increasing production by one to several times. This affected the promotion of contracting work and output, fostered extravagance and waste, and seriously deviated from the masses, and became the general root cause of a series of problems in leading production over the past year.

In planning production, we ignored the rule of "developing production and ensuring supply." Social needs are multifaceted, but we made the mistake of simplification in guiding production. We attached importance to the leadership of grain and cotton production, which is correct; but for a period of time, we neglected the overall leadership and arrangement for the development of diversified operations. Because we overemphasized the role of high-yield crops (corn, tubers) in increasing production, we squeezed out sorghum, millet, minor grains, etc. too much, and rashly changed the original production habits of farmers. Although the harvest of grain increased, there was a shortage of fuel and fodder, and the staple food did not suit the taste. This caused many chaotic phenomena in the lives of urban and rural people.

In promoting various production increase measures and technical reforms, we did not pay enough attention to adapting to local conditions and providing specific guidance. We mechanically copied some foreign experiences and blindly promoted them on a large scale without testing them. For example, wells were dug everywhere in the province in the spring, regardless of whether they were needed or possible; as a result, the scrap rate was very high and the utilization rate was extremely low. Double-plant corn was promoted everywhere. Although many increased production, many also reduced production due to unsuitable conditions. Other similar situations occurred in the promotion of dryland rice sowing, new cotton pruning methods, etc. In addition, there are many shortcomings and errors in the operation and management of cooperatives, in the implementation of the principle of mutual benefit, in the handling of the relationship between the state, agricultural cooperatives and members, in rural political and ideological work, and in the scale of cooperatives.

Although these shortcomings and errors are very serious in some areas, they all belong to the problems that occur in the advancement of the cooperative cause, and therefore have a temporary and non-essential nature, and should never be equated with the essential issue of the superiority of the cooperative system.

It must also be pointed out that the reason for these shortcomings and errors, in addition to the common lack of experience, is mainly that the leading organs above the county level have made subjective and unrealistic mistakes. Therefore, when checking and summarizing the work over the past year, on the one hand, we must positively affirm the work achievements, and on the other hand, when reviewing the shortcomings, we must also take responsibility for the responsibilities that the higher-level leaders should bear, and should not blame the lower levels too much; and we should use all opportunities to explain these situations to the masses in order to reduce the pressure on the grassroots cadres and help them unload their burdens, which is very necessary for restoring and protecting their enthusiasm in the work.

At present, some farmers do attribute the shortcomings and errors in our work to cooperativization due to misunderstanding, and some people do say bad things about cooperatives. These situations must be specifically analyzed, and it cannot be generally assumed that farmers also dislike cooperativization and are preparing to waver and retreat on the cooperativization front. A working group of the Provincial Party Committee's Rural Work Department recently conducted a specific survey and analysis of the ideological situation of the peasant masses in the Democratic Third Cooperative of Sanhe District, Changtu County. This cooperative is one that is not well managed and has reduced production a little. Only about half of the members have increased their income. At first contact, the thinking of the masses is indeed more chaotic; but after deeply contacting the ideological essence of the masses, we came to such a conclusion: the households that increase income are satisfied with the cooperative, and they say "we will not be separated by beating with a stick"; some of the households in difficulty have not increased their income, but they express their determination to find a way out in the cooperative; some of the lower-middle peasants with labor power also look forward, believing that income will always increase as long as they work more. These three types of people account for about 70% in total, and they are still the reliable force for running cooperatives in the future. In addition, although some people have reduced their income, they still believe in the superiority of the cooperative system and have great hopes for the cooperative. They say: "The cooperative is still good, it's just not well led. If we change the way, we can still run it well." This type of people accounts for about 15%. Although some upper-middle peasants have reduced their income and are somewhat shaken, they also don't want to leave because they think that if they withdraw now, they will have to come back in the future. Only a very small number of wealthy households who used to rely on speculative economic activities to make a fortune speak badly about cooperatives. Not only do they actively prepare to withdraw from the cooperative and work independently, but they also want to pull some people out; only these people are currently the "opposition party" of the cooperative.

After doing such a survey and analysis, we have a bottom line in our hearts; after checking and summarizing the advantages and disadvantages of production and cooperative management over the past year, affirming the achievements, exposing the shortcomings, and finding ways to overcome the shortcomings through mass discussions, the active members have become more active, some of the wavering ones have also become firm, and no one listens to the bad words of the "opposition party," and they no longer bother to withdraw from the cooperative. It can be seen from this that the peasant masses have not wavered in taking the socialist road, the masses are very concerned about running cooperatives well, and as long as we make good use of and give play to the wisdom of the masses, we can solve various complex problems encountered in running cooperatives; by doing so, it is not difficult to restore and promote the positive emotions of the masses. Overemphasizing the negative aspects of the masses, and even seeing it as a black mass, thereby losing confidence in advancing in the work, is a bit of "worrying needlessly."

    辽宁省农业合作化以后的第一年
    中共辽宁省委农村工作部部长　褚凤歧
    辽宁省农业合作化以后的第一年已经过去了。
    有人问：合作化究竟是好是坏？农业增产是真是假？增产主要是因为风调雨顺呢？还是由于合作化？说合作化好，为什么农民还有许多不满和怨言呢？这里就辽宁省农业合作化以后一年来的基本情况，来谈谈这些问题。
    辽宁省是在1956年春耕以前实现农业合作化的。全省入社农户占全体总农户的98.6％，其中加入高级社的农户占总农户的92.8％。一年来，根据中央的正确及时的指示，各级领导干部具体帮助农业社进行了一系列的工作：挖掘增产潜力，制订生产规划；不断改进提高合作社的经营管理；大力推行各种增产措施和技术改革；贯彻执行勤俭办社民主办社方针；正确解决合作社的收益分配问题。一年来农村工作的方向是完全对头的。干部和群众都是非常兴奋积极的。
    依靠了合作制度的优越性和农民群众劳动的积极性进行了这许多工作，再加上天时正常的条件，1956年辽宁省的农业生产获得了空前的大丰收。粮谷在1955年丰收的基础上增产了23.3％，总产量达到七百六十万吨，超过了1957年国家原定计划生产指标19.3％。棉花产量达到六万八千吨，比1955年增产一倍，也提前一年完成了1957年计划指标。此外，辽宁省的著名特产柞蚕茧、苹果、烤烟等也都丰收了。全省有85％以上的合作社都不同程度地增产了，80％以上的社员增加了收入。
    这些统计数字虽然还不十分精确，但实现了大幅度的增产却是不容置疑的。为支援灾区，在粮食三定标准外，全省又多征购了几十万吨粮食，现在多数农村的粮食仍很宽裕，农民的购买力是大大提高了。如果不是丰收，购买力怎会提高呢？那些因看到局部地区和某些农业社减产歉收，就误认为是全省性的问题因而对，1956年的增产发生怀疑，这种想法只能说是“只见树木，不见森林”。
    目前还有这样一种论调：1956年的农业增产的原因主要是风调雨顺，不能归功于农业合作化。不容否认，天时正常是1956年农业生产的极为有利的条件；但是，如果没有合作化，这样大量增产是不可能的。1955年辽宁省也是天时比较正常的，这一年的粮食总产量却不是七百几十万吨，而仅仅是六百一十五万吨。这又该作何解释呢？
    就全省范围说，在1956年赖以增产的，除了天时正常的条件以外，主要是采取了这样一些措施：
    1、大力兴修了农田水利。全省新开水田面积达十八万垧，相当于过去几十年开发水田面积总和的一倍半，只这一项就可以增产粮食三十多万吨；并且改变了部分地区历年产量不稳定的情况。
    2、增施粪肥。合作化以后普遍开展了积肥运动，采取各种方法挖掘肥源，施肥面积比往年增加15％以上，单位面积施肥量显著地增加了。农民普遍反映：去年庄稼棵壮粒饱，是肥力大的结果。
    3、推广高产作物。全省除水稻外，玉米薯类种植面积扩大四十多万公顷，只这一项就比往年增加了几十万吨粮食。
    4、改进耕作技术。在九十万公顷土地上推广了各种谷物的良种；拖拉机和新农具翻地面积较前扩大了九倍；“套种”“复种”面积达到十七万公顷；推行了苞米方形双株播种、水稻正行插秧、棉花新整枝法等。凡是因地制宜采取这些技术措施的，都获得了不同程度的增产，并出现了许多新的高产记录。
    5、开垦荒地和消灭地界地角，共扩大耕地面积十五万公顷，增加了粮食的产量。
    6、合作化后大大增强了抗灾能力。各地兴修排涝工程，使二十万公顷土地减少水涝威胁。水土保持工程对控制山地水土流失，保护农田起了很大作用。入夏以后，曾有许多地区发生严重的虫灾，有些地区雨水连绵、草苗齐长，也亏得合作社的人多力量大，终于克制了苗荒和虫灾，保护了禾苗。当时只北镇一县农民捕捉的金龟子虫就有二十多万斤。
    以上这些事实说明：只有实现了合作化，集中了农村中的人力、物力、财力，才可能举办许多为个体农民所不敢想像的事情。
    根据上述这些事实，应该得出这样明确的结论：合作化是广大农民赖以发展生产、增加收入唯一正确的道路。去年合作社办得这样多，总的说来是办得成功的，成功的主要标志就是增加了生产量，增加了农民的收入。
    那末，为什么还有许多不好的现象呢？如：全省还有15％左右的农业社未能增产或者减产了；约有20％的农户没有增加收入或减少了收入；水产、蔬菜、毛猪等未能增产甚至减产了；牲畜死亡的现象发生的很普遍很严重；农业增产了，但城乡人民生活需要的物资供应却感到许多不便和不足，等等，是怎么回事呢？
    解答这些问题，必须首先划清一个界限，就是：虽然这些现象多数是在合作化以后发生的，但是却绝不能把它们归咎于合作社制度，而只能从我们工作中的缺点和错误来找寻原因。正如“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”这篇文章里所说的：“制度是有决定性的，但是制度本身并不是万能的。无论怎样好的制度，都不能保证工作中不会发生严重的错误。”
    一年来，我们在领导生产办社方面，在做出许多成绩的同时，确实也还有许多缺点和错误。
    如在去年春天制订生产计划的时候，最初曾经对合作化后增产的可能性估计不足，因而有右倾保守思想；但在批判了保守思想之后，又过高估计了合作化后的有利因素，忽视困难条件，因而发生了急躁冒进情绪。大指标开始是下边提出来的，但得到了省里的批准，再下去时又层层加大，甚至有提出增产一倍至数倍的。这就影响了包工包产的推行，助长了铺张浪费现象，以致严重地脱离群众，并成为一年来领导生产上发生一系列问题的总的根源。
    在规划生产上，我们忽略了“发展生产，保证供应”这条规律。社会需要是多方面的，我们指导生产却犯了单一化的毛病。我们重视了对粮棉增产的领导，这是对的；但是有一个时期，却忽略了对发展多种经营的全面领导和安排。由于过分强调了高产作物（苞米、薯类）对增产的作用，过多地挤掉了高粱、谷子、小杂粮等，轻率地改变了农民原有的生产习惯，虽然增加了粮食的收获量，但是却发生了燃料、饲草奇缺，主食粮不合口味等。造成城乡人民生活上的许多混乱现象。
    在推行各种增产措施和技术改革中，对于因地制宜、具体指导注意得不够。对有些外地经验机械照搬，不经试验就盲目大量推广。如春天全省各地到处打井，不管是不是需要和可能；结果，废品率很高，利用率极低。双株苞米到处推行，虽有许多增产了，但也有许多因条件不合，减产了。其它如推行水稻旱播、棉花新整枝法等，也有类似情况。另外，在合作社的经营管理上，在贯彻执行互利原则上，在处理国家、农业社和社员三者之间的关系上，在农村政治思想工作上，以及社的规模等等问题上，都有不少缺点和错误。
    这些缺点和错误，虽然在有些地区表现得很严重，但是它们都是属于合作化事业前进中发生的问题，因而带有暂时的非本质的性质，绝不应与合作社制度优越性这一本质问题等量齐观。
    还必须指出一点，就是发生这些缺点错误的原因，除去大家共同缺乏经验外，主要是县以上领导机关犯了主观主义、不切实际的毛病。因此在检查总结一年来工作的时候，一方面要正面肯定工作成绩，一方面在检讨缺点的时候，也要把上级领导应负的责任由自己担负起来，而不宜过多地责备下级；并且应该利用一切机会，向群众说明这些情况，以减少对基层干部的压力，帮助他们卸除包袱，这对于恢复和保护他们工作中的积极性是非常必要的。
    目前，确有一部分农民由于误解而把我们工作上的缺点错误归之于合作化，也确实有些人在说合作社的坏话。对这些情况必须做具体分析，不能笼统地认为农民也在不喜欢合作化，准备在合作化战线上动摇退却了。省委农村工作部有一个工作组最近在昌图县三合区的民主三社对农民群众的思想情况做了具体的调查分析。这个社是一个经营得不大好并且减了一点产的社，只有一半左右社员增加了收入，乍一接触，群众的思想也的确比较混乱；但在深入接触群众的思想实质以后，便得出这样的结论：增加收入户对合作社是满意的，他们表示“棒打不散”；一部分困难户虽未增加收入，但表示坚决在社内找出路；一部分下中农有劳动力的也往前看，认为只要多劳动收入总会增加。这三种人共计约占70％，他们依然是今后办社的依靠力量。此外，有些人虽然减少了收入，但是他们还相信合作社制度的优越性，对合作社抱有很大希望。他们说：“合作社还是好，就是没领导好，要是换换方式，还能办好。”这种人约占15％。一部分上中农虽然减少了收入，有些动摇，但考虑到现在退出去将来还是得进来，也还不想出去。只有极少数过去依靠带投机性质的经济活动发家的富裕户，大说合作社的坏话，不但自己积极准备退社单干，而且还想拉出一些人去；只有这些人目前是合作社的“反对派”。
    做了这样一番调查分析，心里有了底；再经过检查总结一年来生产办社的优点、缺点，肯定了成绩，揭发了缺点，经过群众讨论找出了克服缺点的办法，于是积极的社员更加积极了，有些动摇的也坚定下来了，“反对派”的坏话没人听了，他们也不张罗退社了。由此可见，农民群众对走社会主义道路并没有动摇，群众对办好合作社是非常关心的，只要很好运用和发挥群众的智慧，是能够解决办社中所遇到的各种复杂的问题的；这样做，群众的积极情绪也是不难恢复和发扬起来的。过分夸大群众的消极方面，甚至看成黑漆一团，因而丧失了在工作中前进的信心，这倒是有点“庸人自扰”了。
