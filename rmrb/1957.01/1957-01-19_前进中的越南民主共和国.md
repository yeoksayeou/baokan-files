    The Advancing Democratic Republic of Vietnam
    Wei Ke, Head of the Chinese Delegation of Cultural, Educational, and Health Workers Visiting Vietnam
    Our delegation of cultural, educational, and health workers' forty-day visit to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has left us with deep impressions and pleasant memories.
    First, we personally experienced the close and profound friendship between China and Vietnam. To host our delegation, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam organized a reception committee headed by the Ministry of Education. We received a warm welcome wherever we went. At the beginning and end of our visit, President Ho Chi Minh kindly received us twice. In the end, he took a picture with us and gave each of us a photo with his autograph. Ministers and Vice Ministers of Culture, Education, Health, Agriculture, and Forestry not only personally gave us reports, but also often took the time to talk with us. Comrades from the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party also gave us reports on the history of the Labor Party and the Fatherland Front. Cadres of the relevant departments used great effort to help us in our work.
    The scope of our visit was quite broad, involving the work of the cultural, educational, health, agricultural, and forestry departments. From cities to villages, we visited schools, factories, hospitals, libraries, research institutes, and farmers' residences. We toured many historical sites and scenic spots, and met workers, farmers, teachers, students, government cadres, and senior intellectuals in various professions. They all expressed great enthusiasm for us.
    The staff and service personnel who were often with us, due to being together day and night, had a sincere affection for us. When we left, we all felt reluctant to part. A female service comrade from the South said with tears in her eyes: "Let's meet in the South (meaning South Vietnam)!" She intertwined the feelings of Sino-Vietnamese friendship and the ardent desire for national reunification.
    All these Vietnamese comrades' enthusiasm for us was expressed very naturally and without reservation. This proves that the friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam has taken deep root in the hearts of the people, and that the Vietnamese Party and government's education on Sino-Vietnamese friendship and internationalism is thorough. Our visit has helped to strengthen Sino-Vietnamese friendship.
    Second, this visit deepened our understanding of Vietnam and allowed us to learn many things. We had long known that Vietnam is a beautiful and rich country; the Vietnamese people are a diligent and brave people; the Vietnamese people, for their independence and freedom, have waged a series of heroic struggles, and after the victory of the liberation war, they have achieved great success in recovery and construction. But this was only an empty concept. Only through personal experience can this concept be filled.
    Northern Vietnam is mostly mountainous, with a precipitous terrain. On the train, we saw undulating peaks and lush forests on both sides, presenting a magnificent picture. When the train passed through the northern plains, we saw endless fields, with emerald green rice paddies and orange-yellow rivers weaving a beautiful landscape painting. When we arrived in Hanoi, with its beautiful lakes, brightly colored flowers and plants, and a wide variety of trees, we felt like we were living in a beautiful garden. We visited and toured various places, and also discovered many scenic spots. Special mention should be made of the famous Ha Long Bay, with its towering mountains and uniquely shaped hills rising from the sea, one of the wonders of the world, making us feel as if we had arrived in a fairyland.
    Vietnam has fertile land and abundant mineral resources underground. All the crops and economic crops that can be grown in tropical, subtropical, and temperate zones are available. We have eaten pastries made from various kinds of rice, and tasted various fruits and melons. One kind of banana was particularly fragrant and sweet, said to have been offered to the emperor in the past. We have seen many samples of wood, such as ebony, rosewood, and nanmu. We have also seen many mineral specimens, especially the world-famous Hong Gai coal. Vietnam also has many medicinal plants, the most famous of which is cinnamon from Thanh Hoa.
    The Vietnamese people are a people who love labor. We saw them working diligently in various places.
    The Vietnamese people are a heroic people, with a glorious history of fighting for their independence and freedom. We visited the two temples dedicated to the Vietnamese national heroes, the Trung Sisters and Tran Hung Dao, listened to stories about these three national heroes, and watched a play about the heroine Ly Trieu Thi, learning that the Vietnamese people had waged a heroic struggle against the rule of old Chinese feudalists. We are more familiar with the Vietnamese people's struggle against French colonialism, especially the war of resistance after 1946. Through this visit, our understanding has deepened. The great victory of the Vietnamese war of resistance, especially the decisive victory at Dien Bien Phu, was an important condition for the success of the Geneva Conference.
    The Vietnamese people are responding with unparalleled enthusiasm and selfless labor to the call of the Party and the government to build a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam. They have achieved great successes in politics, economy, culture, education, and health. The grand scene of the eleventh anniversary National Day parade made us deeply realize that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has indeed grown stronger.
    At present, the Vietnamese people have two main political tasks: first, to continue to implement the Geneva Accords; second, to consolidate the North as a base for the struggle for peaceful reunification.
    The Vietnamese government and people have always faithfully implemented the Geneva Accords, and have repeatedly proposed that North and South Vietnam should negotiate to achieve universal suffrage to achieve peaceful reunification, and advocated that people in the North and South should be free to travel to each other before reunification, and cooperate in economy, culture and other aspects. However, due to the constant sabotage of the Geneva Accords by the US imperialists and the Ngo Dinh Diem regime, and their attempts to obstruct peaceful reunification, the legitimate aspirations of the Vietnamese people have not been realized.
    In order to win the support of the people in the South, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam gives special care to cadres, workers, students, experts and other patriotic people who come from the South, such as setting up sanatoriums and schools for them, and solving their livelihood problems, etc. Especially in all aspects of construction, they have set a good example and expanded the political influence of democratic Vietnam. Through the work of the Fatherland Front, the Vietnamese Labor Party has united all parties, people from all walks of life, and religious groups.
    Regarding the work of consolidating North Vietnam, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is taking various measures to consolidate and develop the people's democratic system, and is preparing to gradually move towards socialism in the future. With the exception of a few mountainous areas, land reform has been basically completed, and more than eight million peasants have been distributed land, increasing their enthusiasm for production.
    In order to consolidate and develop the people's democratic system, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pays attention to promoting democracy on the one hand, and pays attention to ensuring social order and eliminating the remaining forces of the enemy on the other. Through land reform in rural areas and household registration management in urban areas, social order has been basically stabilized.
    In the development of the people's democratic system, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attaches great importance to the implementation of ethnic policies, established the Thai-Meo and Viet Bac ethnic autonomous regions, and is preparing to gradually establish other ethnic autonomous regions according to the conditions.
    Another task in developing the people's democratic system is to protect the rights of working people and women. This task is achieved in rural areas through land reform, and in urban areas through the policy of mutual benefit for labor and capital. Men and women are equal, and both parties voluntarily agree to marriage and divorce. Women's political rights have been legally guaranteed.
    In terms of economy, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has gradually changed the economic backwardness left over from the eighty years of French colonial rule, and changed it quite quickly. Taking agriculture as an example, during the French rule, farmers only had three months of food, and the threat of starvation often loomed over the people. In 1945 alone, before the August Revolution, more than two million people had starved to death.
    After the victory of the war of resistance, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam restored most of the abandoned land through the construction of water conservancy projects, accumulating fertilizers, increasing livestock, and improving agricultural tools and seeds. The yield per hectare of rice has increased from 14 quintals to 19 quintals. The autumn rice harvest of 1955 and the summer rice harvest of 1956 were both bountiful, thus basically solving the food shortage problem. In addition, industrial raw material crops have also developed considerably.
    In terms of industry, the old enterprises such as the Hai Phong Cement Plant, the Nam Dinh Textile Factory, the Hong Gai Coal Mine, the Shipyard, and the Phosphate Fertilizer Plant have been successively restored, and their output has also increased. The industrial output in 1955 increased seven times compared with 1954; the industrial output in the first half of 1956 increased three times compared with the whole year of 1955.
    In terms of transportation, 526 kilometers of railways have been restored. The newly built railway from Hanoi to Friendship Pass has long been opened to traffic, and is connected to the repaired railways from Hanoi to Nam Dinh and from Hanoi to Lao Cai. The railway from Nam Dinh to Thanh Hoa is under construction. The original highways have been almost completely repaired, and some new highways have been built. Hai Phong Port has been dredged, and ships twice as large as before can enter the port. Bien Thuy Port has been rebuilt. At the same time, the main waterways have also been dredged and opened to navigation.
    Education has also undergone important reforms and great development. During the French rule, the number of students at all levels of schools in Vietnam was very small, while the number of illiterate people was very large. According to the official statistics of the French colonialists in 1939, out of a population of 20 million in Vietnam, there were only 441,562 primary school students, 4,787 junior high school students, 465 senior high school students, and 700 university students including Laos and Cambodia. Illiteracy accounted for about 95% of the total population; in ethnic minority areas, illiteracy reached 99% or even 100%.
    The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always attached importance to education, and has conducted three reforms of the school system of middle and primary schools based on the educational guidelines of nationalization, scientification, and popularization, and has correspondingly changed the content of education.
    As of July 1956, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had 4,100 middle and primary schools with 615,591 students (private schools not included); and 1,600 university students. In addition, there were 430,000 students in people-run literacy schools. Compared with the number of students during the French rule, the number of primary school students has increased to two times, the number of middle school students nine times, and the number of university students more than two times.
    The Vietnamese Party and Party members, as well as progressive intellectuals, attach great importance to the work of eliminating illiteracy. It can be said that the work of eliminating illiteracy began at the same time as the national liberation movement. Before the August Revolution in 1945, 50,000 people were eliminated from illiteracy. From September 1945 to December 1946, 2.5 million people were eliminated from illiteracy. After the outbreak of the war of resistance, although there were various difficulties, the work of eliminating illiteracy did not stop, and the results were great. At that time, a total of 10 million people were eliminated from illiteracy, including the people in the South.
    From 1945 to 1956, a total of 15.13 million people, including the people in the South during the war of resistance, participated in literacy classes, and nearly 100,000 people participated in teaching work at times. In these eleven years, a total of more than 12.7 million textbooks were published.
    The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is actively carrying out the work of eliminating illiteracy. Propaganda and mobilization work is carried out extensively and deeply, and timely rewards are adopted to encourage emotions. Therefore, the emotions of both teachers and illiterate people are very high. Illiterate people study whenever they have time. Workers and farmers read, read newspapers, and write during rest times, shop assistants read when there are no customers, boatmen read when they are not sailing, and rickshaw drivers read when they take a break. We saw such situations everywhere.
    In Nam Dinh, we saw old people, women holding children, and workers and hawkers who worked all day or even at night, studying hard in literacy classes. In Thuy Linh village, we saw an 84-year-old man studying with young people. Literacy teachers include cadres, workers, students, housewives, old people and young people, and even teenagers. These scenes are very moving.
    Vietnamese literacy workers carefully study teaching materials and teaching methods, and the masses have outstanding achievements in learning. The literacy textbook is concise and to the point, with only forty lessons. Illiterate people who have learned forty lessons can read books and newspapers. The old teaching method first taught letters, then phonetics, and finally literacy. The new teaching method learns letters and spellings at the same time through simple words and sentences, shortening the time for eliminating illiteracy. Originally, an illiterate person could generally learn to read and write within three months. As a result of special efforts, Ho Van An in Hanoi learned to read newspapers in 72 days, and some people have created a new record of getting rid of illiteracy in more than 60 days.
    It should be pointed out here that the adoption of Latinized script in Vietnam has brought great convenience to the elimination of illiteracy. Vietnam originally used Chinese characters. Later, the Vietnamese created Nom characters based on the strokes of Chinese characters. Although Nom characters can express Vietnamese more effectively than Chinese characters, because Nom characters are generally more complex than Chinese characters, the masses are not easy to master. In fact, Nom characters have never been widely promoted.
    In the sixteenth century, European merchants and missionaries came to Vietnam and began to spell Vietnamese with Latin letters, mainly to spell the so-called Bible. Later, after several revisions, the Latinized script currently used in Vietnam was formed. Widespread promotion began in 1918.
    The Latin alphabet used in Vietnam has many additional symbols, which looks more complicated. Nevertheless, this script has a significant role in eliminating illiteracy and popularizing culture, which proves the superiority of phonetic script.
    Vietnamese is a tonal language, has many monosyllabic words, and has absorbed many Chinese words. In these aspects, Vietnamese and Chinese are very similar, although Vietnamese has its own basic vocabulary and its grammar has its own characteristics. The success of Vietnam's adoption of phonetic script has increased our confidence in language reform.
    The Vietnamese Labor Party and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are very concerned about the people's diseases and health, and have used great efforts to carry out medical and health work. Northern Vietnam currently has two fully modernized hospitals; five hospitals with better but not fully modernized equipment; nine hospitals with all departments but with poorer equipment; twenty-eight hospitals with only internal medicine, obstetrics, and minor surgery; four tuberculosis hospitals; and forty-five medical stations. Excluding the beds in hospitals and sanatoriums in the industrial and transportation systems, Northern Vietnam has a total of 15,085 beds. Calculated by population, there is one bed for every 700 people. All people enjoy free medical care.
    Third, this visit exchanged the experiences of education and health between China and Vietnam. Through reports, discussions, and visits, responsible comrades and cadres of relevant departments in Vietnam introduced us to their work, problems, and experiences. We also gave reports on education and health to Vietnamese comrades, and at the symposium, we focused on explaining the experiences of our country in relevant aspects in light of the situation in Vietnam.
    In the process of exchanging experiences, we also learned a lot. The government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have done many things and achieved great successes under extremely difficult conditions. The spirit of hard struggle, not fearing difficulties, and doing everything possible to start many works, as well as the hardworking and simple style of the leading comrades, cadres, and people, is worth learning from.
    Vietnam's work in eliminating illiteracy and language reform also has many experiences worth learning from. Although many of Vietnam's experiences in eliminating illiteracy are the same as ours, their extensive and in-depth propaganda work and the implementation of the policy of "the people teaching the people" are particularly worth learning from. Due to the vigorous propaganda and active support of the Party and the government, eliminating illiteracy has become the political task of every Vietnamese. What we saw gave us such an impression - every illiterate person is learning to read, and every literate person is teaching literacy.
    In terms of language reform, Vietnam has 38 years of experience in using phonetic script, calculated from the time it was widely promoted in 1918. As mentioned above, Vietnamese and Chinese have some similarities. What is most worth referring to is Vietnam's experience in marking tones. Vietnamese has always marked tones. The responsible comrades of Vietnamese language reform and the linguists we visited unanimously believe that in order to make the pronunciation accurate and the appearance of the script clear, it is necessary to mark tones. We have also asked illiterate and semi-literate people who are learning the script and teachers who are eliminating illiteracy, and they also unanimously believe that it is necessary to mark tones. At the same time, they found that it is extremely inconvenient to use symbols placed on letters to mark tones in writing, typing, printing, and telegraphing. They have already used letters to mark tones on telegrams, and are studying using letters to replace various symbols attached to letters.
    Chinese is a tonal language and also has the problem of marking tones. We should study Vietnam's experience in combination with the characteristics of Chinese word formation, so that the problem of marking tones can be reasonably solved.
    As mentioned above, our visit to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam this time has been very rewarding. After returning to our country, we are very pleased to note that the Tenth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party has made important decisions, and the Sixth Session of the National Assembly is progressing smoothly. We believe that the implementation of the decisions of these two important meetings will make the Democratic Republic of Vietnam more consolidated, and will achieve more and more brilliant achievements in economic and cultural construction and the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

    前进中的越南民主共和国
    中国访问越南文化、教育、卫生工作者代表团团长　韦悫
    我们文化教育卫生工作者代表团在越南民主共和国的四十天的访问，留下了深刻的印象和愉快的回忆。
    第一，我们亲身体会到，中越两国之间存在着亲密和深厚的友谊。为了招待我们代表团，越南民主共和国政府组织了以教育部为首的招待委员会。我们所到的地方都受到热烈的欢迎。在访问开始和结束的时候，胡志明主席曾经两次亲切地接见了我们，最后还跟我们一同照相，并赠给我们每个人他亲笔题字的照片。文化、教育、卫生、农林各部部长和副部长，除亲自向我们作报告外，还经常腾出时间和我们交谈。越南劳动党中央有关同志还为我们作了关于劳动党史和关于祖国战线的报告。各有关部门的干部更用了极大的力量，帮助我们进行工作。
    我们访问的范围是相当广泛的，涉及文化、教育、卫生、农林这几个部门的业务。我们从城市到农村参观了学校、工厂、医院、图书馆、研究所、农民住宅，游览了不少古迹、名胜，接触了工人、农民、教师、学生、机关干部和各种专业的高级知识分子。他们都对我们表示了极大的热情。
    跟我们经常在一起的工作人员和服务人员，由于同我们朝夕相处，更和我们有着真挚的感情。当我们离开的时候，彼此都怀着依依不舍的心情。一位从南部来的女服务员同志流着眼泪说：“让我们在南方（指南越）见吧！”她把中越友好的感情和热望祖国统一的感情交织在一起了。
    所有这些越南同志们对我们的热情，都表现得十分自然，毫不勉强，这证明中越两国人民的友谊已经深入人心，越南的党和政府所进行的关于中越友好和国际主义教育是深入的，我们的访问是有助于中越友谊的加强的。
    第二，这次访问加深了我们对越南的认识和了解，使我们学习了许多东西。我们早就知道：越南是美丽、富饶的国家；越南人民是勤劳、勇敢的人民；越南人民，为自己的独立、自由，曾经进行过一系列的英勇斗争，解放战争胜利后，在恢复、建设方面获得了巨大的成就。但这只是一个空洞的概念。只有经过亲身的经历，才能够把这个概念充实起来。
    越南北部多山，形势险峻。我们在火车上看见两旁峰峦起伏，林菁茂密，呈现出一幅壮丽的图画。火车走过北部平原的时候，我们看见了一望无际的田野，翠绿的稻田和橙黄的河流编织成一幅美丽的风景画。到了河内，那里有风景优美的湖，颜色鲜艳的花草，种类繁多的树木，我们感觉得像住在一个美丽的花园里。我们到各地参观、游览，也发现许多风景秀丽的地方。特别应该指出的，是著名的夏龙湾，那里有巍峨雄伟的大山和形状奇特的小丘，耸立在海面上，是世界奇观之一，使我们感觉得好像到了蓬莱仙境一样。
    越南土地肥沃，地下蕴藏的矿产很多，物产和资源都很丰富。凡是热带、亚热带、温带可以种植的农作物和经济作物都应有尽有。我们曾经吃过用各种米制成的糕点，尝过各种水果和瓜，其中有一种香蕉特别香甜，据说这是以前送给皇帝吃的。我们曾经看过许多木材的样品，如乌木、紫檀木、楠木等等。我们也看见过许多矿物标本，特别应该指出的是全世界闻名的鸿基煤。越南还有很多药用植物，其中最著名的可以算是清化出产的玉桂了。
    越南人民是爱好劳动的人民。我们到处看见他们在各种场地上，辛勤地劳动着。
    越南人民是英勇的人民，有着为他们的独立、自由而斗争的光辉历史。我们游览了奉祀越南民族英雄征王姊妹和陈兴道的两座庙宇，听取了关于这三个民族英雄的故事，看了关于女英雄李珍的一出戏，晓得越南人民对旧中国封建主义者的统治，曾进行过英勇的斗争。对于越南人民反抗法国殖民主义者的斗争，特别是1946年以后的抗战，我们比较熟悉。通过这次访问，我们的认识加深了。越南抗战的伟大胜利，特别是奠边府的决定性的胜利，是日内瓦会议成功的重要条件之一。
    越南人民正在以无比的热情和忘我的劳动，响应着党和政府所提出的建设和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南的号召，在政治、经济、文化、教育、卫生等方面，都获得了巨大的成就。第十一周年国庆游行的伟大场面，使我们深切地体会到，越南民主共和国的确是已经壮大起来了。
    目前越南人民有两个主要的政治任务：第一，继续执行日内瓦协定；第二，巩固北部使成为和平统一的斗争基地。
    越南政府和人民一向忠实地执行着日内瓦协定，曾经屡次提出北越和南越应协商实现普选以达到和平统一，并主张在统一以前南北人民应自由来往，在经济、文化等方面进行合作。但是，由于美帝国主义者和吴庭艳政权不断地破坏日内瓦协定，千方百计地阻挠着和平统一，以致越南人民的正当愿望未能实现。
    为了争取南部人民的支持，越南民主共和国政府对于从南部过来的干部、工人、学生、专家和其它爱国人民给予特别照顾，如为他们设立疗养院、学校，解决生活问题等等。尤其是在建设工作的各方面，树立了良好的榜样，扩大了民主越南的政治影响。通过祖国阵线的工作，越南劳动党已经把各党派、各阶层人士、各宗教团体团结起来了。
    关于巩固北越的工作，越南民主共和国政府正在采取各项措施来巩固和发展人民民主制度，并准备将来有步骤地走向社会主义。除少数山区外，土地改革已经基本上完成了，八百多万农民分得了土地，生产积极性提高了。
    为了巩固和发展人民民主制度，越南民主共和国政府一面注意发扬民主，一面注意保障社会秩序和肃清敌人的残余势力。通过农村的土地改革和城市的户口管理，社会秩序基本上安定下来了。
    在发展人民民主制度中，越南民主共和国政府很注重民族政策的实施，成立了泰族—苗族和越北两个民族自治区，并准备根据条件逐步成立其它民族自治区。
    发展人民民主制度的另一任务是保障劳动人民和妇女的权利。这个任务在农村是通过土地改革来实现的，在城市是通过劳资两利的政策来贯彻的。男女平等，男女结婚离婚都由双方自愿，妇女的政治权利都已经有了法律的保障。
    在经济方面，越南民主共和国政府已经把法国殖民主义者八十年统治所遗留下来的经济落后情况，逐步加以改变，并且改变得相当快。拿农业来说，在法国统治时期，农民只有三个月的食粮，饥饿的威胁经常笼罩着人民。仅1945年，在八月革命以前，已经饿死了两百多万人。
    抗战胜利后，越南民主共和国政府通过兴修水利，积储肥料，增加耕畜，改良农具和种子等，荒废的土地绝大部分已经恢复耕作了。水稻的单位面积产量由每公顷十四公担提高到十九公担。1955年秋天和1956年夏天的水稻都获得了丰收，因而基本上解决了粮荒问题。此外，工业原料作物也有相当的发展。
    在工业方面，旧有的企业如海防水泥厂、南定纺织厂、鸿基煤矿、造船厂、磷肥料厂都已经陆续恢复了，产量也增加了。1955年的工业产量比1954年增加了七倍；1956年上半年的工业产量比1955年全年产量增加了三倍。
    在交通运输方面，已经恢复了五百二十六公里的铁路。新建的从河内到睦南关的铁路早已通车，并且跟已修复的从河内到南定和从河内到老街的铁路连接起来了。正在修建的有从南定到清化的铁路。原有公路差不多已经完全修复，并且新筑了一些公路。海防港已经疏浚，比以前大一倍的轮船可以进港。边水港已经重新修建起来了。同时主要河道也经过疏浚通航了。
    教育也有重要的改革和很大的发展。在法国统治的时候，越南各级学校的学生数非常少，文盲数却非常庞大。据1939年法国殖民主义者的正式统计，越南全国人口二千万、只有小学生四十四万一千五百六十二人，初中学生四千七百八十七人，高中学生四百六十五人，大学生包括老挝和柬埔寨在内七百人。文盲占总人口约95％；在少数民族地区文盲达到99％甚至100％。
    越南民主共和国一向重视教育，曾根据民族化、科学化、大众化的教育方针，对中、小学的学制，进行过三次改革，并相应地改变了教育内容。
    截至1956年7月止，越南民主共和国共有中、小学四千一百所，学生六十一万五千五百九十一人（私立学校没有计算在内）；大学生一千六百人。此外，人民自办的启蒙学校有学生四十三万人。跟法国统治时期的学生数比较，则小学生增加到两倍，中学生九倍，大学生两倍多。
    越南的党和党员以及进步的知识分子非常重视扫除文盲工作。可以说，扫除文盲工作是跟民族解放运动同时开始的。在1945年8月革命以前，扫除了文盲五万人。从1945年9月到1946年12月，扫除了文盲二百五十万人。抗战爆发以后，虽然有种种困难，扫除文盲工作却没有停止，并且成绩很大。那时候共扫除了文盲一千万人，包括南方人民在内。
    从1945年到1956年，参加识字班学习的，包括抗战时期的南方人民在内，共一千五百一十三万人，参加教学工作的有时近十万人。在这十一年中，共出版教材一千二百七十多万册。
    越南民主共和国政府正在积极地进行着扫除文盲工作。宣传动员工作做得广泛深入，并采取及时奖励的办法来鼓舞情绪。因此，教员和文盲的情绪都很高。文盲一有空就学习。工人和农民在休息的时候，店员没有顾客的时候，船户不开船的时候，三轮车夫歇下来的时候，都在读书，读报，写字。我们到处看到这样情况。
    我们在南定看到老年人，抱着小孩的妇女和整天甚至夜里也劳动的工人和小贩，都在识字班里紧张地学习。在翠岭村，我们看到八十四岁的老大爷和青年人在一起学习。扫除文盲教师有干部、工人、学生、家庭妇女，有老年人和青年，还有十几岁的少年。这些场面是很动人的。
    越南扫除文盲工作者认真地钻研教材、教法，群众在学习方面也有突出的成绩。识字课本简明扼要，只有四十课。文盲学会了四十课，就能够阅读书报了。老教法先教字母，后拼音，最后教识字。新教法是通过简单的词句，同时学会字母和拼法，使扫除文盲时间缩短了。本来一个文盲一般能够在三个月内学会阅读和书写。由于特别努力的结果，河内胡文恩在七十二天内学会了阅读书报，还有人创造了六十多天摆脱了文盲的新纪录。
    这里应该指出，越南改用拉丁化文字给扫除文盲带来极大的便利。越南原来是使用汉字的。后来越南人根据汉字笔画创造了喃字。虽然喃字比汉字能够更有效地表达越南语，但是由于喃字一般比汉字更为复杂，人民大众就不容易掌握。事实上，喃字从来没有普遍推行过。
    十六世纪欧洲商人和传教士到越南来，开始用拉丁字母拼写越南语，主要是用来拼写所谓圣经。后来经过几次修订，才形成了现在越南使用的拉丁化文字。普遍推行是在1918年开始的。
    越南所使用的拉丁字母有很多附加符号，看来比较复杂。尽管如此，这种文字对于扫除文盲和普及文化有着重大的作用，这证明拼音文字的优越性。
    越南语是有声调的语言，有不少单音词，并且吸收了很多汉语词儿。在这些方面，越南语和汉语是很相似的，虽然越南语有自己的基本词汇，语法也有它的特点。越南改用拼音文字的成功增加了我们文字改革的信心。
    越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府十分关心人民的疾病和健康，并用很大的力量开展医疗卫生工作。越南北部现有完全现代化医院二个；设备比较好而不是完全现代化的医院五个；各科都有而设备比较差的医院九个；只有内科、产科并能做小手术的医院二十八个；结核病医院四个；医疗站四十五个。除工业交通系统的医院和疗养院的病床没有计算在内，越南北部共有一万五千零八十五张病床。照人口计算，每七百人有一张病床。所有人民都享受免费医疗。
    第三，这次访问交流了中越两国教育、卫生的经验。通过报告、座谈和访问，越南有关部门的负责同志和干部给我们介绍了他们的工作情况、问题和经验。我们也为越南同志做了关于教育、卫生的报告，还在座谈会上，针对着越南的情况，着重地说明了我国有关方面的经验。
    在交流经验的过程中，我们也学到了不少的东西。越南民主共和国政府和人民，在极困难的条件下，做了很多事情，获得了很大的成就。领导同志、干部和人民的艰苦奋斗、不怕困难、尽一切力量把很多工作展开的精神和勤俭朴素的作风，是值得我们学习的。
    越南的扫除文盲和文字改革工作也有很多经验值得我们学习。尽管越南的扫除文盲经验有很多是跟我们相同的，他们宣传工作的广泛深入和以民教民方针的贯彻执行，特别值得我们学习。由于党和政府的大力宣传和积极支持，扫除文盲已经成为每个越南人的政治任务。我们所看到的给了我们这样一个印象——每个不识字的人都在学认字，每个识字的人都在教认字。
    在文字改革方面，从1918年开始普遍推行的时候计算，越南使用拼音文字已经有三十八年的经验。上面已经说过，越南语和汉语有些相似的地方。最值得我们参考的是越南文标声调的经验。越南文一向是标声调的，越南文字改革的负责同志和我们所访问的语言学家一致认为，为了使读音准确，文字的面貌清楚，标声调是必要的。我们也曾经问过正在学习文字的文盲和半文盲以及扫除文盲的教师，他们也一致认为标声调是必要的。同时他们发现用符号放在字母上来标声调，在书写、打字、排印、打电报等方面都是极不方便的。他们已经在电报上用字母标声调，并且正在研究用字母代替附加在字母上面的各种符号。
    汉语是有声调的语言，同样有标声调的问题。我们应该结合着汉语构词的特点研究越南的经验，使标声调的问题得到合理的解决。
    如上面所说，我们这次访问越南民主共和国是有很大收获的。我们回国以后，很高兴地注意到越南劳动党中央第十次扩大会议作出了重要的决定，国民大会第六次会议正在顺利地进行着。我们相信这两个重要会议的决定的实现将使越南民主共和国更加巩固，并在经济文化建设和祖国和平统一的斗争中，获得更多的、更辉煌的成就。
