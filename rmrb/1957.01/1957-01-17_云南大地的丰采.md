At the end of last December, I rushed back to Kunming from the Sino-Burmese border. In Mangshi, the coffee trees in the botanical garden were bearing red beans, and the wild cherry blossoms on the Gaoligong Mountains and in the Nujiang River Valley were already in full bloom. The journey of more than nine hundred kilometers was filled with lush greenery. I couldn't help but recall that on the map, the Yunnan Plateau appears as a yellow expanse, easily leading careless readers to mistake it for a barren and desolate place. In reality, it is not only home to the evergreen Kunming and charming tropical scenery, but people also love Yunnan because it is like an underwater forest, just beginning to be explored, and already revealing its abundant and diverse resources.

Geologists have studied the changes in Yunnan's topography during the Himalayan orogeny. This orogeny resulted in a province where the lowest elevation is less than one hundred meters above sea level, while the mountain peaks are above the snow line. As a result, it possesses high-altitude cold, temperate, subtropical, and tropical climates, and countless mineral deposits are buried underground. Biologists say that Yunnan's plant species account for about half of the total in the country. The world-renowned Metasequoia grows into forests here. For this reason, they love to call Yunnan our country's "home of plants."

Let's take a look at the richness of the Yunnan land. Here, I will only briefly introduce Yunnan Province's rich and diverse agricultural resources.

Yunnan's soil is mainly red soil, but it cannot be said that Yunnan's land is barren. Last year was the first year that the rural areas of inland Yunnan achieved collectivization, but grain production had already exceeded the national target of the First Five-Year Plan. The 17 million people of all ethnic groups had an average of 700 jin of raw grain per person. Rice can be harvested twice a year in the vast areas of the south. The high-yielding cooperative in Yiliang County yields 1,000 jin of rice per mu. The Guangtou Cooperative in the high-altitude mountainous area of Huize County successfully trial-planted corn, with a yield twice as high as buckwheat. Currently, there is more cultivable wasteland in the province than existing cultivated land. The land that has been sleeping for years is waiting for hardworking people to awaken it. The youth reclamation teams formed last year have already sent back good news of harvests from the border areas. The construction of the Minjiang River Bridge on the railway being built south from Sichuan has already begun. In a few years, trains will be able to transport Mangshi rice, which is even more fragrant and soft than Tianjin Xiaozhan rice, to Beijing.

Although Yunnan's mountains are so continuous, the average annual temperature, except for high mountains, is only between 15 and 16 degrees Celsius. The complex terrain has become a treasure trove for developing cash crops. Here, tea trees planted two hundred years ago can still be picked. Last year, the province's tea production reached more than 170,000 dan, which is more than three times that of the time of liberation. "Dian Hong" has long been sold to Eastern European countries, and Pu'er tea seeds have also married the land of Hunan and Guangdong, where they are reproducing their offspring.

Yunnan's flue-cured tobacco is even more famous. Last year, the planting area of flue-cured tobacco in the province expanded to one million mu. In early autumn, plump tobacco leaves cover the tobacco fields, and after harvesting, small pink flowers bloom. Yunnan flue-cured tobacco is not only of excellent quality but also has a high yield. There is a type of multi-leaf tobacco whose trunk is taller than a person, forming a forest, and each plant can produce more than one hundred tobacco leaves. Last year, the cooperatives made various attempts to grow tobacco, which surprised even the old tobacco farmers. Yanfeng County even achieved a bumper harvest by planting flue-cured tobacco on mountain slopes, thus breaking the saying that flue-cured tobacco can only be grown in paddy fields. Some places in Yunnan can grow two seasons of flue-cured tobacco a year, and Jiangchuan County has also successfully tested the cultivation method of three crops a year: flue-cured tobacco, rice, and broad beans.

Historically, Yunnan's cotton has relied on support from the inland. Is it true that the Yunnan Plateau does not produce this pure white fiber? No. Last year, the cotton fields in Binchuan County achieved a large-scale bumper harvest. The average yield of more than 60,000 mu of cotton fields reached 56 jin of lint cotton, and more than 200 jin of lint cotton were harvested per mu in the nine mu of high-yield fields. Of course, it is not only that the land in Binchuan is particularly fertile. Last year, the cotton produced in the province has already achieved self-sufficiency in civil wadding.

The valleys and banks of Yunnan's major river basins are also sugarcane producing areas. In 1956, the total sugarcane production in the province was more than 12 million dan. I have eaten sugarcane in Yuanjiang that is as tall as the spring bamboo in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, sweet and crispy, and is a good raw material for sugar making. It is only that Yunnan's current industrial level is still lagging behind, and many places are still using manual sugar extraction, thus limiting the output of sucrose.

Yunnan's agricultural resources are countless. The rapeseed in Kunming was already blooming last December. Yunnan's silkworms can be raised in all seasons and spin silk and cocoons in all seasons.

Of course, the most fascinating thing is the subtropical scenery of the border areas. In Mangshi, pineapples can still bear fruit in the twelfth lunar month. Bananas in Xishuangbanna ripen in winter. Generally speaking, the tropics are south of the Tropic of Cancer, but this scenery can be seen along the coast of Yunnan to the Jinsha River in the north. Especially in the south and southwest, it is simply the home of tropical cash crops. The three-leaf rubber, originally produced in the lower reaches of the Amazon River in South America, has been introduced to Yunnan for 52 years. Botanists have told me that the climatic conditions for planting tropical crops in Yunnan are superior, without the disadvantages of maritime climate, and will not be affected by typhoons like Hainan Island. Therefore, it can be said to be the best place in our country to cultivate rubber. Whether in Hekou, Xishuangbanna, or Dehong, the young trees in the newly opened rubber plantations have already grown up. And in the primeval forests of the tropical rainforest area, scientists have already proven that there are seven or eight kinds of wild vine rubber. The Segeduo in the Honghe Hani area and the deer horn vine in the Xishuangbanna Dai area have a rubber content of more than 85%, and the quality is even better than Brazilian rubber in some aspects.

In the border areas, we can also see a layer of red crystalline nodules on the branches of many large trees. This is Yunnan's special product, shellac. It was originally a rare industrial raw material. Gramophone records are shellac products. Yunnan shellac was recorded in the Tang Dynasty herbal classics more than a thousand years ago. Every spring, local farmers put shellac insects on parasitic trees, and in autumn, the trees are covered with the secretions of shellac insects, which solidify. There are dozens of kinds of parasitic trees for shellac insects in Yunnan. I saw a large banyan tree in Jinggu County that produces 300 jin of shellac a year.

As long as you take a trip to the Yunnan border, you will be like being in a huge botanical garden. Famous small-grain coffee grows in more than a dozen counties here. Last year, in Mangshi, I revisited the coffee trees planted in 1953. One plant had already produced more than 7,500 coffee beans, with more than three kilograms of dry beans. The cinchona trees in Hekou have been planted for 23 years and contain more quinine than those in Taiwan Province. You can see agave all over the fields on the Yunnan-Burma Road. The leaves are 223 cm long, and the longest fibers are 1.6 meters, which is a superior raw material for making marine cables. From the Daying River to the Honghe River, there are forests of kapok on the hills on both sides. The hybrid species of herbaceous cotton in Kaiyuan can bear 1,000 to 4,000 bolls on one tree. Oil palm is the oil crop with the highest oil content in the world. Its oil yield per mu is more than 15 times higher than that of rapeseed. It has also been successfully trial-planted in Xishuangbanna and Hekou. There are too many spice crops in Yunnan to remember their names. Dragon brain incense is the most precious raw material for borneol, and Dai farmers use it to treat cattle wounds, which is truly a cure. Wild lemongrass can extract essential oils from the leaves. I casually picked a few pieces, sandwiched them in a book, took them out, and stroked them with my hands, and my hands could emit fragrance. Here, winter makes people feel spring, and after the autumn harvest, it is a new spring again.

The Yunnan land is not only beautiful, but the ancient forests are still an undiscovered natural mystery. The medicinal materials of the high mountains, the precious animal skins, the lush pastures, have endless wealth, and the great rivers rolling south in the valleys between the mountains, the reserves of water resources rank second in the country. The Yili River Hydropower Station, which has already started construction, is designed to generate more electricity than the existing total electricity generation of Gutian, Guanting, and Shizitan. The total area of the province's main plateau lakes is more than 1.2 million mu. The beautiful Dianchi Lake and Erhai Lake, Fuxian Lake and Heiniao Sea, produce more than 60 kinds of delicious fresh fish. There are so many aquatic creatures there that humans have not really visited.

The land of Yunnan is an endless treasure of the motherland, and it is waiting for people to develop it.

    云南大地的丰采
    新华社记者　王甸
    去年12月底，我从中缅国境线上赶回昆明。在芒市，植物园里的咖啡树正结着红豆，高黎贡山余脉和怒江河谷野生的樱花已经盛开。九百多公里的旅程，满眼尽是绿荫葱郁。我不禁想起地图上的云南高原一片黄色，容易使粗心的读者把它误认作荒凉贫瘠的地方。其实，这里不止有常春的昆明，迷人的热带景色，而且，人们爱云南，还因为它还像一片海底的森林，刚刚探索，就已经发现它的蕴藏是何等地丰茂多采。
    地质学家研究过喜马拉雅山造山运动中云南地形的变迁。这次造山运动使得这一个省内的大山与河谷之间，最低的拔海不到一百公尺，而高山之顶却在雪线以上。因而兼有了高寒、温带、亚热带和热带几种不同的气候，并且地下埋藏着数不尽的矿藏。生物学者说，云南植物的种类占有了全国种类的一半左右。举世名贵的水杉在这里生长成林。为此，他们爱把云南誉为我国的“植物之家”。
    让我们来看看云南大地的丰采吧。这里，我只粗略地介绍一下云南省的丰富多样的农业资源。
    云南的土地以红壤为主，但是决不能说云南的土地是贫瘠的。去年是云南内地农村实现合作化的第一个年份，粮食产量却已经超过了第一个五年计划的国家指标，一千七百万各族人民平均每人已有原粮七百斤。稻谷在南部的广大地区可以一年两熟，宜良县的高产合作社水稻每亩千斤，高寒山区会泽县的光头社试种玉米成功，产量比荞麦高一倍。现在全省可耕的荒地比现有耕地还多，长年熟睡的土地正在等待勤劳的人民去唤醒，去年组成的青年垦荒队已经从边疆传来丰收的喜讯。从四川向南修的铁路上，岷江大桥的工程既已开始，几年以后，火车就可以从这里把比天津的小站米还要香软的芒市大米运给北京了。
    尽管云南的山脉是那般地延绵不断，但是除了高山以外，常年的平均气温只在摄氏十五——十六度之间。复杂的地形变成了发展经济作物的聚宝盆。在这里，两百年前种植的茶树，至今依然可以采摘，去年全省的茶叶产量达到十七万担以上，这个数字相当于解放时的三倍以上。“滇红”早已行销东欧各国，普洱茶籽还和湖南、广东的土地结上了姻缘，在那里繁殖它的后代。
    云南的烤烟就更加富有声誉。去年全省烤烟的种植面积发展到了一百万亩。每当初秋，肥硕的烟叶就复盖了片片烟田，采摘以后，开出粉红的小花。云南烤烟不但质量优异，而且产量也高。有一种多叶烟，基干比人还高，蔚然成林，每一株能够长出一百多片烟叶。去年合作社对种烟作了种种的尝试，使年老的种烟农民也感到惊奇。盐丰县在山坡上种烤烟也居然丰收，从此打破了烤烟只能在水田栽培的说法。云南有些地方一年能种两季烤烟，江川县而且试验成功了烤烟、稻谷、蚕豆一年三熟的耕作方法。
    历来云南的棉花是需要靠内地支援的，难道云南高原真不出这种洁白的纤维吗？不是的。去年宾川县的棉田就获得了大面积丰收，六万多亩棉田平均产量达到皮棉五十六斤，九亩高产田中每亩收了皮棉二百斤以上。当然不止是宾川一地土地特别优厚，去年全省出产的棉花，已经达到民用絮棉自给了。
    云南诸大流域的河谷和两岸，又是甘蔗的产区。1956年全省甘蔗总产量是一千二百多万担。我在元江吃过高得像江浙一带的春竹一般的甘蔗，甜而且脆，是制糖的好原料。只是云南目前的工业水平还落后，许多地方还在用手工榨糖，因此限制了蔗糖的产量。
    云南的农业资源是数不尽的。昆明的油菜去年12月里已经开花了。云南的蚕儿能够四季饲养，四季吐丝作茧。
    当然，最令人迷恋的莫过于边疆的亚热带风光了。在芒市，菠萝在腊月里还会结果。西双版纳的香蕉在冬天成熟。一般说，北回归线以南才是热带，而云南北至金沙江的沿岸都能看到这种景色。特别是南部和西南部，简直是热带经济作物的家乡。原产于南美亚马逊河下游的三叶橡胶，引到云南已经有五十二年了。植物学家告诉过我：云南种植热带作物的气候条件是优越的，没有海洋性气候的缺点，不会受到如海南岛的台风侵袭，因此可以说是我国垦植橡胶的最好的地方。无论在河口、西双版纳或者德宏，新辟的橡胶园里幼树都已经长大了。而在热带雨林区的原始森林里，科学家们已经考察证明的野生藤本橡胶还有七、八种之多。红河哈尼族地区的赛格多，西双版纳傣族地区的鹿角藤，含胶量都在85％以上，质量在某些方面甚至胜过巴西橡胶。
    在边疆，我们还可以看到许多大树的枝干上结着一层红色的晶结，这就是云南特产的紫胶。它原是一种稀有的工业原料，留声机上的唱片就是紫胶制品。云南紫胶早在一千多年以前的唐代本草中就有记载。每年春天，当地农民把紫胶虫放到寄生树上，秋天在树上就染满紫胶虫的分泌液，结成固体。紫胶虫的寄生树在云南有数十种之多，我见到景谷县的一株大叶榕树，年产紫胶竟有三百斤。
    只要到云南边疆来作一次旅行，就会如同置身在巨大的植物园里。这里十多个县份里生长着著名的小粒种咖啡，去年在芒市我重访了1953年定植的咖啡树，一株已经结果七千五百多粒，干豆有三公斤多。河口的金鸡纳树，栽种已经有二十三年的历史，含霜量比台湾省的还高。滇缅路上可以看到遍野的龙舌兰，叶片全长二百二十三公分，纤维最长的有一点六公尺，这是作海里缆索的上等原料。从大盈江到红河，两岸山地上有着成林的木棉。开远的草木棉杂交种，一株树上能够结铃一千到四千个。油棕是世界上含油量最高的油料作物，它每亩比油菜籽的油量要高十五倍以上，在西双版纳和河口也都试种成功了。云南的香料作物多得记不清名字，龙脑香是最名贵的冰片原料，傣族农民都用它为牛创伤涂敷，真是药到病除。野生的香茅草可以从叶片中提炼香精，我随手采了几片，夹在书本中，拿出来用手抚摸，手上就能散出芬芳。在这里，冬日使人觉到春意，秋收以后又是新春。
    云南的大地不止是秀丽而已，旷古的大森林至今还是没有揭开的自然之迷。高山的药材，珍贵的兽皮，水草并茂的牧地，有着无尽的财富，而在群山夹谷中滚滚南流的大江，水力资源的蕴藏居于国内第二位，已经开工兴建的以礼河水电站，设计的发电量比古田、官厅和狮子滩现有的发电总量还大。全省主要的高原湖泊的水，面积共达一百二十万多亩。绮丽的滇池和洱海，抚仙湖和黑鸟海，出产着六十多种美味的鲜鱼。那里繁多的水族，人类却还没有真正地访问过。
    云南大地是祖国的无尽的宝藏，它期待着人们来开发。
