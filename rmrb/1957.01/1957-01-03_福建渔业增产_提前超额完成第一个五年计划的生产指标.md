Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, January 1st – In 1956, the total output of coastal fisheries in Fujian Province reached over 510 million jin, an increase of 12.8% compared to 1955, completing the production targets of the First Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule and exceeding them by 1.3%.

During the year, the coastal areas of Fujian Province suffered 75 gales of force six or higher and seven strong typhoons. Gales of force six or higher and typhoons blew for a total of 201 days. The Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched on Taiwan, Jinmen, and Matsu Islands frequently carried out sabotage and harassment, severely affecting fishermen's offshore production. However, the fishery production cooperatives in coastal areas brought their advantages into full play, using their own funds and state loans to add more than 1,200 new fishing boats and a large number of fishing gear. They also unified the use of nets and labor, implemented year-round multi-species fishery rotation and concurrent operations, combined inshore and offshore fishing, fixed and mobile operations, and transferred fishing ground production under the protection of the People's Liberation Army coastal defense forces. These measures overcame various difficulties, resulting in a general bumper harvest of fish and shellfish.

    福建渔业增产
    提前超额完成第一个五年计划的生产指标
    新华社福州1日电　在1956年内，福建省沿海渔业生产的总产量共达五亿一千多万斤，比1955年增加12.8％，提前一年并超额1.3％完成了第一个五年计划的生产指标。
    这一年内，福建省沿海曾经先后遭受七十五次六级以上的大风和七次强台风的袭击，吹刮六级以上大风和台风的时间共达二百零一天，盘踞台湾、金门和马祖岛的蒋军又常常四出破坏骚扰，渔民出海生产受到严重影响。但沿海各地渔业生产合作社都发挥了优越性，用自有资金和国家发放的贷款，添置了一千二百多条新渔船和大批渔具，并且统一使用船网和劳力，实行全年多种渔业轮作、兼作和内海与外海、定置与流动相结合生产，以及在人民解放军海防部队保护下转移渔场生产等办法，克服了种种困难，使鱼贝产量仍然普遍丰收。
