Comrade Zhou Enlai, dear comrades He Long, esteemed guests:

    Please allow me, on behalf of the leading bodies of the Polish United Workers' Party and in my own name, to propose a toast to the further beneficial fraternal cooperation between our two parties.

    Over the decades since its founding, the Chinese Communist Party has been a tireless educator of the working class and the entire Chinese people, and a glorious organizer of the Chinese people's struggle for national and social liberation. It has victoriously ended the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China. Under its leadership, China's long-standing division and fragmentation have been eliminated for the first time in history, and the independent People's Republic of China has been established.

    Today, the Chinese Communist Party has become the leading force in China based on the people's united front.

    The Chinese Communist Party is making significant contributions to the further development of the immortal ideas of Marxism-Leninism, and to the creative application of these ideas to the specific and historical conditions of different countries.

    The Polish United Workers' Party and the Chinese Communist Party, as well as the parties of other socialist countries, are currently developing beneficial cooperation, drawing on the experiences of socialist construction, the great experience of the first socialist country, the Soviet Union, and the experiences of other countries.

    In the recent period, the Polish United Workers' Party, based on the traditions of the Polish working-class movement, the experience of the entire international working-class movement and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the historically significant resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, has entered a period of revitalizing party life along Leninist lines, and overcoming the deviations that have affected the party's activities in the past. This process of revitalizing party life will enable the party to further strengthen its ties with the masses, and enable the party, together with other parties in the national united front, to become an effective weapon in the struggle to build socialism in Poland.

    In the process of striving to achieve this goal, the Polish United Workers' Party steadfastly safeguards the unity of the international proletariat, upholds ideological unity of purpose, and safeguards the cooperation of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries based on the principles of equality and mutual respect.

    In the process of our mutual exchange of experiences, we highly value the realistic and fraternal discussions between the parties of various countries, and we cherish your friendly attitude towards our party.

    I raise my glass to the good health of Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China and Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, to the heroic Chinese Communist Party, and to the great ally, the Chinese people.

### 哥穆尔卡的讲话

    哥穆尔卡的讲话亲爱的周恩来同志，亲爱的贺龙同志，贵宾们：
    请容许我代表波兰统一工人党的领导机构并且以我个人的名义建议，为我们两国的党之间进一步的有益的兄弟合作而干杯。
    中国共产党在建党以来的几十年内，一直是工人阶级和全体中国人民的孜孜不倦的教育者，是中国人民争取民族解放和社会解放斗争的光荣的组织者，它胜利地结束了在中国反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义势力的斗争。在它的领导下，中国多年来的分裂割据局面在历史上第一次消灭了，独立的中华人民共和国建立了起来。
    今天，中国共产党在人民统一战线的基础上，成了中国的领导力量。
    中国共产党在进一步发展不朽的马克思列宁主义思想方面，在创造性地把这种思想运用在不同国家的具体情况和历史情况方面，正在作出重大的贡献。
    波兰统一工人党和中国共产党以及其他社会主义国家的党，目前正在发展有益的合作，吸取社会主义建设的经验，吸取第一个社会主义国家苏联的伟大经验以及其他国家的经验。
    在最近一个时期内，波兰统一工人党在波兰工人阶级运动的传统的基础上，在整个国际工人阶级运动和苏联共产党的经验以及苏共第二十次代表大会具有历史意义的决议的基础上，进入了沿着列宁主义路线重振党的生活的时期，进入了克服过去曾经影响党的活动的偏差的时期。这种重振党的生活的过程将使党能够进一步加强自己同群众的联系，使党能够同全国统一阵线的其他党派一起成为在波兰建设社会主义的斗争中的有效武器。
    波兰统一工人党在争取达到这个目标的过程中坚定不移地维护国际无产阶级的团结，维护思想上的目标一致，维护各国共产党和工人党基于平等和互相尊重的原则的合作。
    在我们互相交流经验的过程中，我们非常珍视各国党之间实事求是的、兄弟般的讨论，我们珍视你们对我们党的友好态度。
    我举杯祝中华人民共和国主席、中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志身体健康，祝贺英雄的中国共产党，祝贺伟大的盟友中国人民。
