Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 21st. Xinhua News Agency reporter Cao Xuepu reports: Junan County, Shandong Province, pays attention to utilizing the enthusiasm of agricultural cooperative production team leaders. These people are playing a significant role in the development of winter production.

Junan County won a bumper harvest last year despite suffering from serious natural disasters. However, after the autumn harvest, an average of more than 70% of the production team leaders in each agricultural cooperative requested to "change shifts." According to the Secretary of the Junan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the reasons for this situation were: some cooperative management systems were too rigid and did not conform to reality, production plans were frequently changed, causing production team leaders to encounter many difficulties in their work; in addition, there were many natural disasters last year, and the tasks were heavy, the leadership lacked specific guidance for the production team leaders, with more criticism than help; when problems arose, the cooperative members also complained about them, and in this way, their work enthusiasm gradually slackened.

In order to reverse this situation, Junan County, from mid-November of last year, held training classes in phases, giving all production team leaders in the county a general training. During the training, the leadership made self-criticism, explaining the shortcomings in last year's work, mainly caused by the subjectivism and bureaucratism of the leadership. They affirmed the role of the production team leaders in striving for a bumper harvest and summarized and introduced examples of how to be a good production team leader. Afterwards, they also organized forces to solve the specific difficulties they encountered in their work.

Now, most of those production team leaders who were originally unwilling to work have become active again. The members of the Victory Second Agricultural Cooperative of Daliugou Village, affected by the "shift change" demands of Wang Kangfu and other eight production team leaders, rarely went to the fields to work. Later, this situation changed. They now lead the members to the fields every day to engage in winter production. In just over twenty days in December last year, this cooperative deep-plowed nearly a hundred mu of land and built one hundred and ninety-two mu of terraced fields. The Jianguo Cooperative of Quanlong Township experienced a reduction in production last year, and the production team leaders were originally unwilling to continue working. The cooperative director also lost confidence in running the cooperative well. However, after these production team leaders were trained, they immediately consulted with the cooperative management committee and organized sideline production such as transportation, earning more than 2,000 yuan in twenty days, which was all distributed to the members, thereby consolidating the cooperative.

### 莒南县注意发挥生产队长的积极性  原来不安心工作的也重新积极起来了

    莒南县注意发挥生产队长的积极性
    原来不安心工作的也重新积极起来了
    新华社临沂21日电　新华社记者曹学璞报道：山东省莒南县注意发挥农业社生产队长的积极性，这些人在开展冬季生产中起了很大的作用。
    莒南县去年在遭受严重自然灾害的情况下赢得了丰收，但是在秋收以后，各农业社平均却有70％以上的生产队长要求“换班”。发生这种情况的原因，据中共莒南县委书记说：有些社的管理制度定得太死，不切合实际，生产计划经常变动，使生产队长在工作中遇到很多困难；又加去年自然灾害多，任务重，领导上对生产队长缺乏具体指导，批评多，帮助少；出了问题，社员也埋怨他们，这样，他们的工作劲头就逐渐懈怠了。
    为了扭转这种情况，莒南县从去年11月中旬以后，分期开办了训练班，将全县生产队长普遍训练一遍。在训练中，领导上做了自我批评，说明去年工作中的缺点，主要是领导上的主观主义官僚主义造成的，肯定了生产队长在争取丰收中的作用，并且总结介绍了如何当好生产队长的范例。以后，又组织力量解决他们在工作中的具体困难。
    现在，原来那些不安心工作的生产队长，绝大部分已经重新积极起来了。大柳沟村胜利第二农业社的社员，因受王康福等八个生产队长闹“换班”的影响，很少下地干活，后来已改变了这种情况，他们每天带领社员下地从事冬季生产，仅去年12月二十多天中，这个社就深翻地近百亩，修梯田一百九十二亩。泉龙乡建国社去年减产，生产队长原先都不愿再干了，社主任也失去了办好社的信心。但是这些生产队长经过训练以后，立即和社务管理委员会商量，组织了运输等副业生产，在二十天中就获利二千多元，全部支给社员，使社得到巩固。
