    Ode to Lenin
    Wang Jingzhi
  You are a drop of water in the ocean,
  A single drop cannot make an ocean; only by gathering countless drops,
  Can you create a boundless ocean
    —The great Communist Party! A surging tide,
  Infinite power. You are a drop of water in the ocean,
      And also the ocean. Always inspired by the people,
  You are naturally great! Always loyal to the class,
  You are naturally invincible! Always obeying the leadership of the Party,
  You are naturally sublime! You are an atom in the sun,
  A single atom cannot make a sun; only by uniting countless atoms,
  Can you create a white-hot sun
    —The glorious Communist Party! Radiant light,
  Limitless sunshine. You are an atom in the sun,
        And also the sun. Always inspired by the people,
  You are naturally great! Always loyal to the class,
  You are naturally invincible! Always obeying the leadership of the Party,
  You are naturally sublime! You are a carbon in a diamond,
  A single carbon cannot make a diamond; only by crystallizing countless carbons,
  Can you create the hardest diamond
    —The strong Communist Party! Closely united,
  Incomparably strong. You are a carbon in a diamond,
    And also a diamond. Always inspired by the people,
  You are naturally great! Always loyal to the class,
  You are naturally invincible! Always obeying the leadership of the Party,
  You are naturally sublime!

    列宁颂
    汪静之
  你是海洋中一滴水，
  一滴水造不成海洋；你集中起无数水滴，
  才造成无边的海洋
    ——伟大的共产党！汹涌澎湃，
  无穷的力量。你是海洋中一滴水，
      也是海洋。永远受人民的启发，
  你自然伟大！永远忠于阶级，
  你自然无敌！永远服从党的领导，
  你自然崇高！你是太阳中一个原子，
  一个原子造不成太阳；你团结起无数原子，
  才造成白热的太阳
    ——光辉的共产党！灿烂光明，
  无限的阳光。你是太阳中一个原子，
        也是太阳。永远受人民的启发，
  你自然伟大！永远忠于阶级，
  你自然无敌！永远服从党的领导，
  你自然崇高！你是钻石中一个碳，
  一个碳造不成金刚钻；你把无数的碳素结晶，
  才造成最硬的金刚钻
    ——坚强的共产党！紧密结合，
  无比地坚强。你是钻石中一个碳，
    也是金刚钻。永远受人民的启发，
  你自然伟大！永远忠于阶级，
  你自然无敌！永远服从党的领导，
  你自然崇高！
