    The Sandy Clay Roads of the Huaibei Plain
    Wu Rongjiang
    Anyone who has been to the Huaibei Plain knows that in the past, on sunny days, cars traveling on the roads kicked up dust more than ten feet high. On rainy days, the mud was over half a foot deep, making it difficult to travel. The Bengbu-Fuyang highway was impassable for three days after a light rain and seven days after a heavy rain. The motor transport company planned to halt operations for ten days each month, and sometimes the roads were impassable for an entire month in winter. But now, our cars travel smoothly on the Bengbu-Fuyang highway. The bluish-gray road surface, lined with rows of trees on either side, stretches endlessly into the distance. The old scenes are nowhere to be seen. We are traveling in a large bus with thirty-five seats, traveling at nearly forty kilometers per hour. The passengers did not feel any severe bumps. We left Bengbu in the morning, stopped for a long rest along the way, and arrived at Fuyang station at one o'clock in the afternoon.
    Just over a year ago, the Huaibei Plain did not have a single smooth road that could be used in both sunny and rainy weather. In particular, the main route from Bengbu to Fuyang could not be used normally, which brought many difficulties to the eight million people of the Fuyang Special District. Several years ago, the local government wanted to build a gravel road that could be used in all weather, but because the gravel had to be transported from more than 150 kilometers away, the cost was too high. Moreover, the transportation mainly relied on manual labor and animal power, requiring a huge transportation team. The desire to build a gravel road could not be realized. But the road workers did not give up their plans and were always looking for ways to solve the difficulties.
    When building the road in 1950, some farmers could not find brick debris, so they brought hard mud clods picked up from the fields. At that time, although there were very few of these mud clods on the road, road workers found that roads paved with these mud clods were not severely damaged after years of vehicle rolling and grinding, and were more wear-resistant than those paved with brick debris. From then on, this hard mud clod, called sandy clay, was used to replace gravel for paving roads. In June 1955, the Bengbu-Fuyang highway was paved with sandy clay.
    At the road maintenance section, I met Tian Dexing, the section chief, who was the leader in using sandy clay to pave roads. He excitedly talked about how the construction of the Bengbu-Fuyang highway cost less and had good quality. He said that if gravel pavement were used, one kilometer would require four hundred cubic meters of gravel and fifty cubic meters of yellow sand, which would require nine hundred ox carts, two thousand seven hundred oxen, and one thousand eight hundred people for transportation. The cost of one kilometer of road would be 9,550 yuan. The sandy clay soil is produced near the road and is found everywhere in the fields, making transportation very convenient. It costs only 2,291 yuan to build one kilometer of road with it; the cost of building one gravel road can build more than four sandy clay roads.
    The sandy clay road also has a good effect on driving. Cars use fifteen liters less gasoline per hundred kilometers than before. Moreover, the road surface is softer, and the life of the tires is also extended. A driver comrade said: The time from Bengbu to Fuyang has been shortened by three hours compared to the past, and the ticket price has also been reduced from seven yuan to four yuan and seventy-nine cents. During the flood prevention and disaster relief period in 1956, more than 150 vehicles passed through every day in continuous rainy days, transporting millions of tons of supplies to the heavily affected area of Fuyang in a timely manner. The disaster victims said: Without this road, our lives would be difficult to guarantee. The benefits that this road brings to the people are incalculable.
    Of course, in the early stage of using sandy clay to pave roads, many resistance emotions were encountered. Tian Dexing himself also had concerns. He said that at the beginning, he was always unwilling to use sandy clay to pave roads, fearing that in such a large project, the country would spend a lot of money, and it would be unusable after paving. In the engineering section he led, an engineer also wrote a report to the higher authorities, saying that although sandy clay is different from ordinary soil, paving roads is theoretically impossible. The reason is that according to the test results, sandy clay can only be used as the bottom layer and cannot be used as the surface layer. Due to the insistence of the Provincial Department of Transportation, and also due to the past experience of paving a small section of road with sandy clay, many workers reported that sandy clay was useful. With the help of technicians, the workers finally quickly created a set of construction methods for paving sandy clay pavement.
    Now, the sandy clay road has been built for more than a year: it has gone through two winters and one summer, and has experienced freezing, dryness, and soaking, but the road has not stopped traffic for a single day. Because sandy clay contains mud, it has stronger bonding properties than gravel. The road surface is flat, like an asphalt road. There are no ruts or potholes. It is neither muddy in rainy days nor dusty in sunny days.
    This original road has attracted the attention of road units across the country. A delegation from the Ministry of Communications visited the road, and many provinces will also use sandy clay to pave roads in areas lacking stone sources.
    Zhang Zhaofu, Deputy Director of the Anhui Provincial Highway Bureau, is inspecting the eight sandy clay roads under construction. He told me that he is from Hebei, where there is sandy clay, but there are many dirt roads. In the past, no one paid attention to using sandy clay to improve the road surface. If sandy clay can also be used locally there to build sandy clay roads, the savings in road construction funds would be even more amazing. I think, if every area in the country that lacks stone and has sandy clay can use local materials to build roads, how much construction funds can be saved!

    淮北平原的砂壃公路
    吴荣江
    去过淮北平原的人都知道，从前，在那儿晴天的公路，车子走过，灰尘卷起一丈多高；雨天烂泥半尺多深，泥泞难行。蚌（埠）阜（阳）公路小雨后三天不通车，大雨后七天不通车；汽车公司一个月就计划停车十天，冬天有时整月不能行车。可是，现在我们的汽车却平稳地行驶在蚌埠到阜阳的公路干线上，青灰色的路面，夹着公路旁的两行树木，无尽头地伸延开去，再也看不见往日的景象了。我们乘的是有三十五个座的大客车，每小时行走近四十公里。车上的人没有感到有一点剧烈的颠簸。早上离开蚌埠，途中还停车休息了很久，下午一点钟就到达了阜阳车站。
    一年多以前，淮北平原没有一条平整的晴雨都能通车的公路。特别是蚌埠到阜阳的一条主要路线不能正常通车，给阜阳专区八百万人民带来了许多困难。几年前，当地政府就想建设一条晴雨通车的石子公路，但因为石子要从一百五十多公里以外远途运来，造价太高；而且运输工具主要依靠人力畜力，需要庞大的运输队伍，建设石子公路的愿望不能实现。但是公路工作人员却没有放弃自己的计划，总在想办法解决困难。
    1950年修公路的时候，有的农民找不着砖渣，就把从田里拾起的坚硬的泥团送来了。那时，垫在公路上的这种泥团虽然很少，但公路工作者发现这种泥团铺设的公路，经过多年车辆磨轧，损坏还不十分严重，比砖渣铺的耐磨得多。从此，这种被称为砂壃的硬泥团就被用来代替石子铺筑公路了。1955年6月，蚌阜公路用砂壃铺成。
    在公路管理段里，我遇到了段长田德兴，他是采用砂壃铺筑公路的领导人，他兴奋地谈到蚌阜公路的建设花钱少质量好。他说，如果是铺石子路面，一公里需要四百方石子和五十方黄沙，要用九百辆牛车，二千七百头牛，一千八百个人来运送，一公里路造价就要九千五百五十元。而砂壃土出产在公路附近，遍及田野，运送很方便，用它筑路一公里只需二千二百九十一元；建设一条石子公路的费用，可以建设四条多砂壃公路。
    砂壃公路在行车效果上也很好。汽车行驶一百公里比以往节约了十五公升汽油。而且路面较软，轮胎的寿命也延长了。一位司机同志说：从蚌埠到阜阳，时间比以往缩短了三小时，票价也由七元降低到四元七角九。1956年防汛救灾期间，在阴雨连绵的日子里，每天通过一百五十多辆汽车，把千万吨物资及时运到了阜阳重灾区。灾民们说：如果没有这条公路，我们的生活就难保证了。这条公路给人民带来的好处是无法计算的。
    当然，在采用砂壃铺路初期，遇到过许多抵触情绪。田德兴本人也有过顾虑。他说开始总不愿意用砂壃铺路，怕在这样大的工程中，花了国家的许多钱，铺好了不能用。在他领导的工程段里，有一个工程师还专门给上级写了一份报告，说砂壃虽然不同于一般泥土，但铺公路在理论上行不通，理由是：化验结果，砂壃只能做底层，不能铺表层。由于省交通厅的坚持，也由于过去有一小段砂壃铺路的经验，不少工人反映说砂壃是管用的，工人们在技术人员帮助下，终于很快创造出一套铺砂壃路面的施工方法。
    现在，砂壃公路建成一年多了：已经过了两个冬天和一个夏天，经历了冰冻、干燥和水泡的日子，然而公路上没有停止过一天通车。由于砂壃含泥，比用石子结合性强，路面平坦，好似柏油马路一样，没有出现一处车槽和坑凹现象，雨天既不泥泞，晴天又少尘土。
    这条独创的公路，引起了全国公路单位的重视，交通部组成的代表团参观了这条公路，许多省也将利用砂壃在缺乏石料来源的地区铺设公路。
    安徽省公路局副局长张兆夫，正在检查兴建中的八条砂壃公路。他告诉我，他是河北人，那里有砂壃，但土路很多，过去一直没有人注意利用砂壃改善路面；如果那里也能就地取材，铺筑砂壃公路，节省的公路建设资金，就更惊人了。我想，要是全国每一个缺石料又有砂壃的地区，都能就地取材铺筑公路，要节约多少建设资金呵！
