　　The Third Production Team of the Prosperity Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fanrong Township, Acheng County, Heilongjiang Province, has consistently lagged behind in production over the past year: spring plowing was more than half a month late; summer weeding was prolonged, resulting in the abandonment of more than twenty hectares of land; and autumn threshing operations also progressed very slowly.
　　The production lag in this team is closely related to the frequent changes of production team leaders. Over the past year, this production team has changed a total of nine team leaders. Were all these changes necessary? Not so. For example, team leader Xiao Yongxin was dismissed simply because he spent too much time playing chess during the summer weeding breaks. Some team leaders were simply replaced because they had "few working methods and low leadership prestige."
　　Because team leaders are changed too frequently, newly appointed leaders are afraid to take bold responsibility. One team leader said, "I have to be careful, if I don't do well, I'll be dismissed and scolded by the members." It is said that the current three team leaders and deputy team leaders are also unwilling to continue.
　　Changing production team leaders one after another like a revolving lantern is clearly not a serious attitude towards cadres and work. No one can guarantee that they will never make mistakes in their work; the working ability and prestige of any cadre are not achieved overnight. What attitude should be taken towards a cadre who works hard but has few methods and low prestige? Is it better to casually deny him and dismiss him, or to patiently help him learn working methods and gradually build prestige? This is not a difficult judgment to make.

### 队长换得太勤

    队长换得太勤
    黑龙江省阿城县繁荣乡繁荣农业生产合作社第三生产队，一年来生产总是跟不上趟：春耕迟了半个多月；夏锄因为拖长了时间，扔了二十多公顷地；秋后打场作业进展也很迟缓。
    这个队的生产这样落后，同生产队长换得太勤很有关系。一年来，这个生产队一共换了九个队长。是不是这些队长都非换不可呢？不是这样的。比如队长肖永信，仅仅因为夏锄中间休息的时候下棋多占了一些时间，就被撤换了。有的队长，仅仅因为“工作办法少、领导威信不高”而被简单地换掉了。
    因为队长换得太勤，新上任的队长都不敢大胆负责。有的队长说：“可得小心点，干不好，撤职，还得挨社员骂。”据说现任的三个正副队长也不愿意继续干下去了。
    像走马灯一样，把生产队长一个接着一个地换下去，这显然不是对待干部和工作的严肃态度。谁也不能保证自己在工作中永不出毛病；任何一个干部的工作能力和威信，都不是一个早上得到的。对于一个努力工作，但是办法不多、威信不高的干部，应该采取什么态度呢？是轻率地去否定他、撤掉他好呢，还是耐心地去帮助他学会工作办法从而逐渐建立威信好呢？这并不是很难判断的。
