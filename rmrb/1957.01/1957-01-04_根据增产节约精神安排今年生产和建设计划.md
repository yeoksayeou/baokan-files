    Arranging this Year's Production and Construction Plans According to the Spirit of Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
    Saving More Than Three Million Yuan in Funds

    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation recently formulated a new construction plan for the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise construction base for 1957, based on the spirit of thrift. The new plan saves more than three million yuan in investment compared to the original plan. The funds saved will be used to purchase some urgently needed construction machinery.

    In order to welcome the upcoming large-scale construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel, this enterprise originally planned to double the expansion of various affiliated enterprises that had already been built in 1957. However, considering that the production potential of the various affiliated enterprises that had already been built had not been fully utilized, and that the various auxiliary repair facilities of Wuhan Iron and Steel that would be gradually completed and put into production could also be used to serve the construction project, this unit decided to reduce or appropriately simplify the car parking and repair base, concrete mixing plant, steel bar processing plant, wood processing plant, paint and asphalt processing plant, central laboratory, and other projects that were originally planned to be expanded in 1957. For example, the originally planned construction of the second concrete mixing plant required an investment of 700,000 yuan; the new plan decided to replace it with two concrete mixing stations, which would only cost 100,000 yuan. After the paint and asphalt processing plant is suspended, the paint and asphalt processing work will be moved to simple sheds at the construction site.

    In addition, the new plan also determines the construction of prestressed concrete processing plants, prestressed pipe processing plants, and grinding factories, etc., according to the needs of 1957. These projects are being built to save building materials and promote new technologies. After the prestressed pipe processing plant is completed, the produced pipes can replace steel pipes and cast iron pipes, saving 90% of steel.

    Overcome Equipment Shortages, Guarantee a 10% Increase in Production

    This newspaper reports: Harbin Wire Factory, in brewing the 1957 production plan, put forward specific directions and asked employees to deeply explore the potential for increasing production and practicing economy.

    This factory achieved great success in the comprehensive conservation campaign launched in the fourth quarter of 1956, and some employees therefore developed slackening thoughts such as "the potential has been exhausted" and "conservation is easy". In early December last year, after the Harbin Municipal Party Committee mobilized to carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the Party Committee of the factory first convened a factory-wide employee meeting to criticize the above-mentioned erroneous ideas. In terms of approach, based on the production characteristics of 1957 and the problems in production in 1956, specific requirements were put forward in terms of improving technology, improving equipment to improve production efficiency, product quality, and expanding new varieties, researching and saving raw materials, and improving work systems to improve work efficiency, so that everyone could think of ways to increase production and practice economy.

    Now, employees throughout the factory have put forward hundreds of suggestions and measures. Only part of what has been reviewed, once gradually implemented, can guarantee a 10% increase in production in 1957 and save 300,000 yuan. Originally, according to the 1957 production tasks, the capacity of various equipment was on average 30% short, and some were short by half or double. At the same time, there are also fourteen new products that need to be put into production and trial production, and the existing equipment cannot meet the needs in terms of precision. Now, after research by various professional technicians and production workers, methods for improving the mechanical structure have been proposed, and the problems of insufficient equipment capacity and insufficient precision have all been resolved.

    Improve Labor Productivity and Equipment Utilization

    This newspaper reports: The Party Committee of Chongqing Power Plant is re-revising the 1957 plan in the spirit of diligence and thrift in running the enterprise.

    Chongqing Power Plant had already prepared the 1957 plan in early November 1956 and had submitted it to the central government for approval. Recently, the factory Party committee organized cadres to study the documents of the Eighth National Congress's Second Plenary Session, reviewed the plan in accordance with the spirit of increasing production, practicing economy, diligence, and thrift in running the factory, and revised the 1957 plan.

    Originally, it was considered that the labor force was not enough, and it was decided to increase the number of production workers and management cadres by more than fifty people, so that the labor productivity in 1957 would be 12.3% lower than in 1956. Recently, after investigation, it was found that there was waste in the use of labor in various workshops and offices. After studying the above situation, the Party committee decided to start with adjusting the labor organization and reduce the existing staffing. In this way, not only will the labor force in 1957 not need to be increased, but it can be reduced by more than forty people, and labor productivity will also increase by 6.33% compared to last year.

    In the past, there was a big hand in the use of electricity in the factory. This time, in addition to conducting in-depth investigations into the waste of electricity in the factory, the Party committee strictly criticized the above-mentioned erroneous ideas and decided to reduce the factory's electricity consumption from the originally planned 8.78% (of power generation) to 8.70%. In this way, more than 146,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity can be saved in 1957. After studying with the technical department, the Party committee also decided to reduce the coal consumption per kilowatt-hour from the originally planned 0.504 kg to 0.500 kg, which is expected to save 200 tons of natural coal in 1957.

    The leaders of the factory have always thought that mechanization and automation are required everywhere. Therefore, in arranging the plan, many places were not considered properly. For example, the boiler desuperheater has already been mechanized, and the original plan also decided to change it to automatic control. The Party committee decided to cut it during the review of the plan. At the same time, the mechanical ventilation of the induced draft room and the signal device of the lower turbine and other projects that can be built or not built or can be delayed were also cut, which can save more than 28,000 yuan. Many problems that originally required investment to solve have been repeatedly studied by the Party committee and decided to use methods to tap potential instead.

    Overcome Raw Material Difficulties, Strive for Increased Production This Year

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 30th: Various cultural and educational supplies factories in Tianjin are working hard to improve technology and find substitutes to overcome the difficulties in the supply of raw materials and strive to increase the production of cultural and educational supplies by 20% in 1957 to supply market needs.

    The employees of Tianjin Ink Factory, which produces "Ostrich" ink, have researched a new formula. According to the new formula, the quality of the ink will not be reduced, and the consumption quotas of the four main raw materials of ink blue, carbolic acid, glycerin, and formalin can be reduced. With the saved raw materials, more than 100,000 liters of ink can be produced throughout 1957.

    Under the condition of ensuring product quality, the employees of many factories have also put forward measures to increase production and save money by using waste materials instead of good materials and using easy-to-find materials instead of scarce materials. The New China Stationery Factory produces about 500 kilograms of stainless steel scraps left over from manufacturing steel pen nibs every month. In the past, these scraps were treated as waste products. In December, employees successfully used these scraps to manufacture pen nibs, which fully guaranteed the supply of raw materials in the first quarter of 1957.

    根据增产节约精神安排今年生产和建设计划
    节约了三百多万元资金
    新华社讯　武汉冶金建筑总公司最近本着节约精神，制定了1957年武汉钢铁联合企业建筑基地的新的建设方案。新方案比原来制定的计划节约了三百多万元的投资。节约下来的这笔资金，将被用来添购一些急需的施工机械。
    这个企业为了迎接即将到来的武钢大规模施工，原来计划把已经建成的各项附属企业在1957年中再扩建一倍左右。但是，这个单位考虑到已经建成的各项附属企业的生产潜力还没有充分发挥，将要陆续建成和投入生产的武钢各项辅助修理设施，也可以利用来为建设工程服务，因此决定把原来计划在1957年扩建的汽车停放和修理基地、混凝土搅拌厂、钢筋加工厂、木材加工厂、油漆、沥青加工厂、中心试验室等工程，有的加以削减，有的适当地简化。如原来计划建设的第二混凝土搅拌厂，需要投资七十万元；新方案决定改由两个混凝土搅拌站代替，只要十万元就够了。油漆、沥青加工厂停建以后，油漆和沥青的加工工作将移到施工现场的简易工棚里进行。
    另外，新方案还根据1957年的需要，确定新建预加应力混凝土加工厂、预加应力管加工厂和磨碎工厂等。这些工程是为了节约建筑材料、推行新技术而建设的。预加应力管加工厂建成以后，生产出来的管子可以代替钢管和铸铁管，能够节约90％的钢材。
    克服设备不足困难，保证增产百分之十
    本报讯　哈尔滨电线厂，在酝酿编制1957年生产计划中，提出具体方向，交给职工深找细挖增产节约潜力。
    这个厂在1956年第四季度开展的全面节约活动取得很大成绩，部分职工因此产生了“潜力挖尽”和“节约容易”等松劲思想。去年12月初，中共哈尔滨市委动员开展增产节约运动后，这个厂的党委首先召开了全厂职工大会，批判了上述各种错误思想。在做法上，根据1957年生产特点和1956年生产中的问题，就提高技术、改进设备以提高生产效率、产品质量和扩大新品种、研究节省原材料和健全工作制度以提高工作效率等方面，提出了具体要求，让大家想办法增产节约。
    现在，全厂职工已提出成百条建议、措施，仅已经审查的部分逐步实现后，就可保证1957年增产10％，节约三十万元。本来按照1957年生产任务计算，各种设备能力平均欠缺30％，个别的差一倍或一半。同时，还有十四种新产品分别要投入生产和试制，现有设备在精度上也不能满足需要。现在，经过各专业技术人员和生产工人研究，提出了改进机械结构的办法后，设备能力不足和精度不够的问题已全部获得解决。

    提高劳动生产率和设备利用率
    本报讯　中共重庆发电厂党委本着勤俭办企业的精神，重新修订1957年的计划。
    重庆发电厂早在1956年11月初就编制了1957年的计划，并且已经报送中央审批。最近，厂党委组织干部学习了八届二中全会文件，按照增产节约和勤俭办厂的精神，重新审查了计划和修改了1957年的计划。
    原来认为劳动力不够用，决定增加生产工人和管理干部五十多人，这样，1957年的劳动生产率就反比1956年降低12.3％。最近经过调查，发现各车间、各科室在使用劳动力上都有浪费。党委研究上述情况以后，决定从调整劳动组织入手，减缩现有人员的编制。这样一来，1957年的劳动力不但不需要增加，反而可以减少四十多人，劳动生产率也将比去年提高6.33％。
    过去在厂用电方面大手大脚。这次，党委除深入调查厂用电方面的浪费以外，并严格批判了上述错误思想，决定将厂用电由原计划8.78％（占发电量）降低到8.70％，这样，1957年即可节约十四万六千多度电。党委在和技术部门研究之后，还决定将每度电的煤耗量由原计划零点五零四公斤降低到零点五零零公斤，预计1957年可节约天然煤二百吨。
    处处要求机械化、自动化也是厂的领导者们一贯的思想，因此，在安排计划时，许多地方都考虑不当。例如锅炉减温器已经机械化了，原计划还决定把它改为自动控制。党委在审查计划中，决定削减，同时被削减的还有引送风室的机械通风，和下透平的信号装置等可建可不建或可以缓建的工程，共可节约二万八千多元。许多原计划需要投资才能解决的问题，经过党委反复研究，都决定改用挖掘潜力的办法来解决。

    克服原料困难，争取今年增产
    新华社天津30日电　天津市各文教用品工厂正在努力改进技术、寻找代用品，克服原料供应困难，争取在1957年增产20％的文教用品供应市场需要。
    生产“鸵鸟”墨水的天津墨水厂职工研究出了一种新配方，按照新配方生产，墨水质量不降低，墨水蓝、石炭酸、甘油和富尔马林四种主要原料的消耗定额都可以减少，利用节省的原料生产，1957年全年可以增产墨水十万公升以上。
    许多工厂的职工在保证产品质量的条件下，还提出利用废料代替好料、用容易找到的材料代替缺少的材料的增产节约措施。新中华文具厂制造钢笔尖每月剩下的不锈钢边料约五百公斤，过去这些边料都当废品处理，12月份职工利用这些边料制造笔尖成功，使1957年第一季的原料供应有了充分保证。
