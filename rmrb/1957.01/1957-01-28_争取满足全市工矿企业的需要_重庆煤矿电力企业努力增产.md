Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 26th: Coal mine and power enterprise workers in Chongqing are devising methods to tap production potential and strive to meet the power needs of industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises throughout the city. After investigation and research, the Chongqing Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry has determined to increase coal production by 120,000 tons this year and save more than 1 million yuan in labor and raw material consumption costs. Workers at Tianfu Coal Mine plan to mine coal from the fire zones within the mine to increase coal production. After repeated research by technicians, a relatively complete set of grouting and fire prevention measures has been developed. Workers at this mine have also found ways to overcome difficulties such as insufficient underground ventilation. After adopting these measures, this mine can increase coal production by more than 100,000 tons this year compared to last year. Workers at Nantong Coal Mine have researched and formulated technical measures for mining coal seams with gas outbursts and are preparing to strengthen tunneling work, which will add more than 100,000 tons of coal mining areas to the entire mine, ensuring an increase of 20,000 tons of coal this year.

All thermal power plants are also taking measures to increase power generation. Workers at the Daxi Gou Power Plant recently conducted experiments and research, increasing the output rate of two generators, which increased power generation capacity by 500 kilowatts. After implementing measures to reduce plant power consumption, all power plants in the city can reduce plant power consumption by more than 30% this year compared to last year. The plants have also carefully studied technical measures for safe production and are preparing to seize the opportunity during the Spring Festival to overhaul machinery and equipment in order to reduce safety accidents by more than half this year compared to last year. In terms of hydropower, workers at the Shizitan Hydropower Station have formulated methods for saving water and storing water in reservoirs, striving to enable the water turbines currently and futurely put into production to generate electricity better. In addition to maximizing equipment potential to increase power generation, the Chongqing Power Supply Bureau is further addressing the difficulty of insufficient power supply by adjusting the load. According to the comprehensive adjustment plan recently drafted, it is estimated that the power load can be reduced by 5,000 kilowatts this year.

    争取满足全市工矿企业的需要
    重庆煤矿电力企业努力增产
    新华社重庆26日电　重庆市煤矿和电力企业的职工设法挖掘生产潜力，争取满足全市工矿交通企业的动力需要。煤炭工业部重庆管理局所属各矿经过调查研究，确定今年增产十二万吨煤，节约一百多万元的人工、原材料消耗费用。天府煤矿职工计划开采矿内的火区煤层，来提高煤的产量。经过技术人员的多次研究，已经制定出一套比较完善的灌浆防火措施。这个矿的职工，还找出了克服井下通风量不足等困难的办法。采取这些措施以后，这个矿今年就可比去年增产煤十万吨以上。南桐煤矿的职工，经过研究制定出开采瓦斯突出煤层的技术措施，并且准备加强掘进工作，这样就使全矿增加了十多万吨煤的采掘地区，今年可以保证增产两万吨煤。
    各火力发电厂也都在采取措施，增加发电量。大溪沟发电厂职工最近经过试验研究，提高了两台电机的出车率，使发电能力提高了五百瓩。全市各电厂采取措施降低厂用电后，可使今年厂用电消耗比去年降低30％以上。各厂还认真研究了安全生产的技术措施，并且准备利用春节期间抓紧检修机器设备，以争取今年的安全事故比去年降低一半以上。在水电方面，狮子滩水电站职工已经订出节约用水和水库蓄水的办法，争取目前和今后投入生产的水轮机能够更好的发电。除了尽量发挥设备潜力增加发电量外，重庆电业局正进一步从调整负荷着手，克服电源不足的困难。经过最近拟定的全面调整方案，预计今年可以压缩电力负荷五千瓩。
