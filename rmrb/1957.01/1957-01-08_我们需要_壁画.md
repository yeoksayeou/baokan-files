    Talking about Painting

    We Need "Murals"
    Pan Jiezhi
    Entering some tall public buildings, such as memorial halls, auditoriums, theaters, and stations, one often feels: this place needs murals.
    Flipping through old art history books, the incomplete records about murals often make me beam with joy. Having the good fortune to see ancient murals that have survived historical calamities, such as those in Mogao Grottoes, Yulin Grottoes, Maijishan Grottoes, Yongle Palace, Guangsheng Temple, and Fahaizi Temple, moves me to lament and admire, lingering and reluctant to leave.
    We really need a lot of murals!
    Our country was once a nation with extremely developed mural art. The history of murals can be traced back at least two thousand years. Before the Song Dynasty, most important painting works were murals. Murals were visible everywhere, from palaces, government offices, ancestral halls, and temples on the ground to tombs underground. It was truly a magnificent sight.
    The role of murals is significant. They face the masses, and therefore, in ancient times, they were used to serve the interests of monarchy and theocracy; but they also satisfied the artistic appreciation needs of the broad masses of people.
    Ancient temples and monasteries were public art galleries and schools for artists. The masses appreciated art here and offered suggestions for artists' creations [Note 1]. Artists took apprentices here and engaged in creative competitions [Note 2]. Murals cultivated thousands of artists, including outstanding geniuses like Gu Kaizhi, Zhang Sengyao, Wu Daozi, and Zhou Fang. Murals also raised the artistic appreciation level of the people. The development of murals marks the prosperity of a country's painting art.
    Murals played a great role in ancient times. Here, I do not want to carefully analyze their merits and demerits, as this is not the responsibility of the art form itself. I only want to say that in today's social conditions, it can play a greater role and become a true art of the masses. It will eliminate the negative elements in ancient murals, draw endless strength from the masses, and constantly enrich and improve.
    Today, we have better conditions for creating murals. Modern science can solve the problem of wall preservation and prevent various types of damage. The themes and styles can allow painters to roam freely. We don't have to worry about not having a place to use our talents.
    What we lack is probably only one thing: skills. The techniques of mural painting cannot be easily mastered. They require long-term, arduous training, as well as learning from teachers: studying ancient murals, consulting with old folk painters, and accumulating experience bit by bit.
    This is the difficulty given to us by the long-term interruption of the mural tradition. We must overcome it, and we can overcome it.
    It is time to train a large number of mural experts.
    When public art galleries as prosperous as ancient temples appear on our vast land, and when hundreds of millions of people can appreciate the beautiful mural works of art masters, I think our painting will surely surpass the highest peak in history and illuminate the world.

### 我们需要“壁画”

    我们需要“壁画”
    潘洁兹
    走进一些高大的公共建筑物，如纪念馆、礼堂、戏院、车站等，常常感到：这里需要壁画。
    翻翻旧美术史，那些挂一漏万的关于壁画的记载，往往使我眉飞色舞。有幸看到历史劫灰的古代壁画，如莫高窟、榆林窟、麦积山、永乐宫、广胜寺、法海寺等处，更使我悼惜赞叹，徘徊不忍舍去。
    我们实在需要很多的壁画！
    我国曾是壁画极发达的国家，壁画的历史至少可以追溯到二千年以上。在宋以前重要的绘画作品多是壁画，壁画随处可见，从地上的宫殿、官衙、祠堂、寺观，一直画到地下的墓穴，真是猗欤盛哉。
    壁画的作用是巨大的，它面向群众，因而在古代，它被利用来为君权和神权服务；但它也满足着广大人民艺术欣赏的要求。
    古代的寺院庙宇是公众画廊，也是艺术家的学校。群众在这里欣赏艺术，给艺术家的创作提意见〔注一〕，艺术家在这里带徒弟，进行创作竞赛〔注二〕。壁画培养了成千上万的艺术家，其中包括像顾恺之、张僧繇、吴道子、周昉那样出众的天才；壁画也提高了人民群众的艺术欣赏水平。壁画的发达标志着一个国家绘画艺术的繁荣。
    壁画在古代发挥了很大作用，在这里我不想仔细分析其功罪如何，这不是壁画这种艺术样式的责任。我只想说，在今天的社会条件下，它可以发挥更大的作用，成为真正的群众艺术。它将排除古代壁画中的那些消极因素，从群众中吸取无穷无尽的力量，不断丰富和提高。
    我们在今天有更好的条件来制作壁画。现代科学可以解决壁面的保固问题，防止各种破坏。题材和风格可以让画家自由驰骋。我们不愁没有用武之地。
    我们缺少的恐怕只有一样：技巧。壁画的技巧不是轻易能够掌握的，须要长期的刻苦的锻炼，还要拜老师：研究古代壁画，请教民间老画工，积累起一点一滴的经验。
    这是壁画传统长期中断所给予我们的困难，我们必须克服，也能够克服。
    是培养大批壁画专家的时候了。
    当我们广大的土地上出现如古代寺观之盛的公众画廊时，当亿万群众都能欣赏艺术大师优美的壁画作品时，我想，我们的绘画必将超迈历史的最高峰而照耀世界。
    〔注一〕周昉画章敬寺，广泛听取群众意见，修改画稿；画成，精妙为当时第一。（见唐朝名画录）
    〔注二〕五代跋异画洛阳广爱寺，为张图所屈，后来在福先寺取胜于李罗汉。（见五代名画补遗）
