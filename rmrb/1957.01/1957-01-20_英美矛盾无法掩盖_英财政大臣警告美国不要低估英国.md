Xinhua News Agency, January 19th: British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Peter Thorneycroft, delivered a speech at an American Chamber of Commerce luncheon in London on the 17th, warning the United States "not to underestimate the fundamental strength of Britain."

Thorneycroft said: "We remain bankers controlling a large part of world trade," and "this bank is not for sale."

Thorneycroft said that Britain must be able to compete in the international market, otherwise it would achieve nothing. He stated that the British government firmly supports the proposal to establish a West European free trade zone. At the same time, Britain "intends to maintain our special relationship with the Commonwealth." He believes that Britain relies on "Europe" on the one hand and "the Commonwealth" on the other, and "there is no contradiction between the two."

In his speech, Thorneycroft also talked about Anglo-American relations, saying that the United States and Britain "have had and will have quarrels in the future." He went on to emphasize that what must be remembered is: "The damage we two countries can inflict on each other may be greater than the damage that any third party can inflict on us." He specifically asked the United States not to let "protectionist pressures" undermine the stable market needed for Britain to export to the United States.

    英美矛盾无法掩盖
    英财政大臣警告美国不要低估英国
    据新华社19日讯　英国财政大臣桑尼克罗夫特17日在伦敦的美国商会午餐会上发表演说，警告美国“不要低估了英国的基本力量”。
    桑尼克罗夫特说：“我们仍然是控制着很大一部分世界贸易的银行家”，“这家银行是不会出售的”。
    桑尼克罗夫特说，英国必须能够在国际市场上竞争，否则就一事无成。他表示，英国政府是坚决支持建立西欧自由贸易区的建议的。同时，英国“打算保持我们同英联邦的特殊关系”。他认为，英国所倚重的一方面是“欧洲”，另一方面是“英联邦”，而“这两者之间是没有矛盾的”。
    桑尼克罗夫特在这次演说中还谈到英美关系，他说，英美两国“曾经有过而且将来还会有口角”。他接着强调说，必须记住的事情是：“我们两国可能给予彼此的损害也许会比任何第三者所能给予我们的损害要大”。他特别要求美国不要让“保护贸易主义者的压力”来破坏英国向美国输出所需要的稳定的市场。
