According to the Hebei Daily, on the afternoon of December 29th, Hebei Province's Vice Governor Ma Li convened a meeting of secretaries-general and chief secretaries of various provincial-level organs. He reported on the 17th meeting of the Hebei Provincial People's Committee's call for staff members of provincial-level organs, as well as administrative organs of party and government organizations, people's groups, and enterprises and institutions above the county level, not to buy pork, beef, or mutton during the Spring Festival. He discussed leaving the meat for the people and troops to buy, and studied how provincial-level organs could specifically implement this.

Vice Governor Ma Li, after explaining the meat supply situation, particularly emphasized that the reason for proposing this call was to do the best possible job of supplying meat to workers, farmers, and urban residents, and to ensure the reasonable needs of the troops during the Spring Festival meat shortage, which is of great significance. Vice Governor Ma Li also provided specific explanations based on the call from the 17th meeting of the Provincial People's Committee. He said that first, staff members of the organs directly under the Provincial People's Committee are called upon not to increase their meat ration quotas during the New Year's Day period in 1957. During the ten days before the Spring Festival (i.e., January 20th to 30th), they should not buy pork, beef, or mutton (except for postpartum women and the sick). He hoped that the staff members of party and government organizations, people's groups, and administrative organs of enterprises and institutions above the county level would also follow this spirit.

    本报讯　据河北日报消息：12月29日下午，河北省马力副省长召集省级各机关的秘书长和秘书主任开会，就河北省人民委员会第十七次会议号召省级机关工作人员及县以上的党政机关、人民团体和事业、企业的行政管理机关的工作人员，春节不买猪、牛、羊肉，把肉让给人民群众和部队去买的问题作了报告，并研究了省级机关如何具体去做的问题。
    马力副省长在说明肉食的供应情况以后，特别着重说明了所以提出这一号召是为了在春节肉食紧张的情况下，尽量地做好对工人、农民、市民的肉食供应和保证部队的合理需要，意义是重大的。马力副省长并根据省人民委员会第十七次会议的号召，具体地进行了解释。他说，首先号召省人民委员会直属机关的工作人员在1957年元旦期间，不增加肉食供应指标；在春节的前十天（即1月20日至30日）当中，不买猪、牛、羊肉（产妇、病员例外），并希望县以上的党政机关和人民团体及事业企业的行政机关的工作人员也本此精神办。
