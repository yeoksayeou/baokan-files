The construction project of the Daye Iron Mine, the raw material supply base for the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex, has entered its peak construction period this year, with the year's tasks being more than six times higher than last year.

    武汉钢铁联合企业的原料供应基地——大冶铁矿的建设工程，今年已经跨入了施工的最高峰时期，全年的任务比去年高出六倍以上。到1958年底，这个矿就可以生产大量的铁矿石。
