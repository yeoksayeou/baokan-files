Flowers and Fairies

Gongsun Ding

The people of ancient times were probably rarely bound by the social atmosphere of vulgar sociology, so their lives and interests were very rich, with magnificent struggles, tense labor, and infatuated hobbies. People loved not only the majestic mountains and rivers, but also the subtle grass and trees, the beauty, fragrance, and purity of flowers. From hobbies, they spread the wings of fantasy, creating beautiful stories with a strong romantic color, entrusting them with life's ideal interests, aesthetic hobbies and appreciation. Simple stories with pure souls knock on the readers' hearts. True artists respect the people's interests and hobbies, draw inspiration from them, and regard them as a ladder to reach ideals, creating artistic flowers that never wither. However, mediocre artists treat the people's interests and hobbies as chairs to sit under their asses, and use moralistic "art" to ruin the people's love and interest in life and art.

The story "The Old Gardener's Late Encounter with a Fairy" is not a great work, but it is a flower that belongs to the type that never withers. An infatuated old flower gardener, Qiu Xian, devoted all his energy to the love of flowers, turning soil, sowing, fertilizing, watering, accompanying the flowers to endure the wind and sun during the day, and the clear dew and frost at night. He worked hard, looking forward to the grand occasion of a hundred flowers blooming. Who can say that his light life is not poetry? The people around him respected him, thanked him, and cared for him, deriving aesthetic enjoyment and the joy of life from him, and seeing the flowers in life. Only those who love flowers can appreciate flowers, and only those who love beauty can appreciate beauty. However, Zhang Yanei and his lackeys, who did not know what flowers were, arbitrarily destroyed the flowers and beat Qiu Xian. The old flower gardener shed tears in the moonlight, heartbroken. Qiu Xian's infatuation moved the fairy, helping him to return fallen flowers to their branches. Zhang Yanei then colluded with the government, attempting to put Qiu Xian to death on the grounds of bewitching the public with sorcery and seize the garden. The fairy saved the old flower gardener and punished those bad people. Qiu Xian also ascended to heaven.

Although the story has blood, tears, struggles, and resistance, it is still a delicate and lingering lyrical poem. The tragic elements are condensed in the idealized romantic plot. It mainly tells the readers about the rich pleasures of the people's lives: loving beauty, loving nature, and making life as beautiful as poetry. Although there are storms and the destruction of evil forces, it cannot destroy it. Therefore, the appearance of the fairy with supernatural powers beyond reality is precisely the embodiment of people's ideals of loving beauty. They not only love beauty, flowers, and a life like flowers, but also create a fairy with supernatural and social powers to protect it. This fairy is also a beautiful flower of fantasy, is poetry. Only dogmatists can reduce the rich content of this beautiful story merely to the class struggle of oppression and anti-oppression. Understanding it this way is precisely to obliterate the masses' love of beauty. It would be a bit of a killjoy to appreciate the film "Autumn Elder's Encounter with a Fairy" adapted from it with this view.

"Autumn Elder's Encounter with a Fairy" basically conforms to the spirit of the original in its basic outline. As a movie, it adds many watchable "dramas." As for exactly what is good about it, and to what extent, it can be answered by film critics with detailed analysis. However, as an audience member, I am willing to watch it, and the broad audience is also willing to watch it. What is the reason?

Recently, I have often thought about the following question: Why do audiences so enthusiastically like opera films or films adapted from classical literary works, even if there are obvious contradictions or errors in the presentation methods, audiences forgive them, and even when criticized by newspapers and magazines, they raise some "defenses" that violate common sense. Are the audiences ridiculous? No. Are the audiences like what some critics say, that their "general requirements are not high" or their "intuition of art appreciation" is too poor? Not necessarily. After watching "Autumn Elder's Encounter with a Fairy," I thought further. I think the reason why audiences like this type of film, in addition to being able to see the performances of famous drama performers, there also seem to be some other things. A relatively good opera film or a film adapted from classical literary works at least retains some good elements of the original work it is based on. These elements must have their historical traditions, and the characteristics of tradition are that they have a mass base and have been tested by the long-term selection of the masses' hobbies. Therefore, as long as the film has more of these traditional factors and characteristics, it can quickly become one with the audience and be accepted by the audience. Because in this sense, it at least awakens and restores the traditional life interests, artistic interests, and aesthetic abilities of the masses that have been corrupted by some disguised lectures of "art," making it "return fallen flowers to their branches." For "Autumn Elder's Encounter with a Fairy," it can also be understood in this way, although it still has some unnecessary "gags" that are specifically meant to make people laugh, choirs and group dances that are inconsistent with the characters and environment, and stiff "modernized" plots and scenes. If artists want to make their works flowers that never wither and gain the welcome of the masses, they need to be as infatuated with flowers as Old Qiu, be faithful to life, and be faithful to the traditional interests of the masses. Even if there are difficulties, they will get the help of the fairy (the masses' ideal hobbies and interests). (Attached picture)

    鲜花和仙女
    公孙丁
    古代的人们，大概很少受庸俗社会学的社会风气的束缚，所以生活和趣味非常丰富，有壮烈的斗争，有紧张的劳动，也有痴心的爱好。人们不仅爱雄伟的高山大川，也爱纤微的一草一木，爱鲜花的艳丽、芳香、纯洁。从爱好展开幻想的翅膀，创造出具有浓厚的浪漫色彩的美丽的故事来，寄之以生活的理想趣味，美的爱好和欣赏。纯朴的故事带着纯洁的灵魂，叩击着读者的心灵。真正的艺术家尊重群众的这种趣味、爱好，从中吸取灵感，把它当作达到理想的阶梯，创造出永不雕谢的艺术的鲜花。而平庸的艺术家，却把群众的这种趣味、爱好，当作椅子坐在屁股下边，用劝世文式的说教“艺术”，败坏群众对生活和艺术的爱好和趣味。
    平话“灌园叟晚逢仙女”虽不是伟大的作品，但却是属于永不雕谢的一朵鲜花。一位痴心的老花匠秋先，把自己全副精力都投在对花的爱上，翻土、播种、施肥、浇水，白天陪花经受风吹日晒，夜间陪花经受清露寒霜。他辛辛苦苦，期待着群艳争芳的盛况。谁能说他那清淡的生活不是诗呢？周围的人尊敬他、感谢他、爱护他，从他那里得到了美的享受、生活的乐趣，看到了生活里的花。只有爱花的人才能欣赏花，只有爱美的人才能欣赏美。而不知花为何物的酒肉之徒张衙内及其爪牙，却任意摧残了花，殴打了秋先。老花匠对月流下了眼泪，痛心了。秋先的痴情感动了仙女，帮他使落花返枝。张衙内又勾结官府，企图以妖法惑众的罪名置秋先于死地，霸占花园。仙女救了老花匠，惩治了那些坏东西。秋先也升仙而去。
    故事虽然有血，有泪，有斗争，有反抗，但还是细腻缠绵的抒情诗，悲剧的因素被凝结在理想化了的浪漫色彩的故事情节里。它告诉读者的主要的是人民群众生活的丰富乐趣：爱美，爱自然，生活像诗一样美，虽然有狂风暴雨，恶势力的摧残，但不能毁掉它。所以，那有超越现实的神力的仙女的出现，也正是人们爱美的理想的幻化，不仅爱美，爱花，爱花一样的生活，而且创造出了能保护它的超自然力和社会力的仙女，这仙女也是一朵美丽的幻想之花，是诗。只有教条主义者才把这个美丽的故事的丰富内容仅仅归结为压迫和反压迫的阶级斗争。这样理解它恰恰是抹杀群众爱美的趣味，抱着这种见解去欣赏根据它改变的电影“秋翁遇仙记”，那就有点煞风景了。
      “秋翁遇仙记”在基本轮廓上大体是符合原著精神的。而作为电影，它又增加了许多可看的“戏”。至于它究竟那些地方好，好到怎样的程度，可由电影评论家以细致的分析来回答。但是，作为一个观众，我愿意看它，广大的观众也愿意看它。什么道理？
    近来我常常想这样一个问题：为什么观众那样如醉如狂的喜欢戏曲影片或根据古典文学作品改编的影片，即使在表现方法有的还存在着明显的矛盾或错误，观众也原谅它，甚至在受到报刊批评时，还提出一些违背常识的“辩护”。观众可笑么，不是。观众是像某位批评家说的“一般要求不高”或“艺术欣赏的直觉”太差么？未必然。看了“秋翁遇仙记”，我进一步的想了想，我以为观众所以喜欢这一类影片，除了能看到著名的戏剧表演家的表演以外，还似乎有些别的东西。一部比较好的戏曲影片或根据古典文学作品改编影片，至少保留了它所依据的原著的一些好的因素。这些因素必然有它的历史传统性，而传统性的特点是有群众基础的，是经过了群众的爱好长期的选择考验的。所以，只要影片中比较多的具备了这种传统性的因素和特点，它就能很快的和观众打成一片，为观众所接受。因为在这种意义上，它起码是唤醒了、恢复了被某些化装讲演的“艺术”所败坏了的群众的传统的生活趣味、艺术趣味和审美能力，使之“落花返枝”。对于“秋翁遇仙记”，也可以这样认识，虽然它还有一些不需要的专逗人一笑的“噱头”，与人物环境不调协的合唱、集体舞、生硬的“现代化”的情节和场面。如果艺术家想使自己的作品成为永不雕谢的鲜花，获得群众的欢迎，就需要像秋翁对花的痴情那样，忠实于生活，忠实于群众的传统的趣味，即令有困难，也会得到仙女（群众的理想爱好趣味）的帮助。（附图片）
