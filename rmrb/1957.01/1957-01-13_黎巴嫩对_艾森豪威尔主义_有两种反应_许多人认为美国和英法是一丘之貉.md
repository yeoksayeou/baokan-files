Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, January 11th: The "Eisenhower Doctrine," the American plan to interfere in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries, has provoked two kinds of reactions in Lebanon.

"Al Hayat" said: "On the one hand, the (Lebanese) Prime Minister refuses to comment on the 'Eisenhower Doctrine,' while on the other hand, the Foreign Minister says that Lebanon approves of the American President's plan."

Those who support the "Eisenhower Doctrine" insist that Lebanon must rely on American support to maintain its "independence" because the power of Britain and France in the Near East has been greatly weakened. Besides this opinion, many prominent Lebanese political figures have pointed out the dangers of the "Eisenhower Doctrine." For example, former Lebanese Prime Minister Karami said in an article published in "Al Siyasa" that the American "new" policy that Eisenhower is preparing to implement in the Middle East is the same policy that France and Britain have implemented. The article emphasizes that the people will not allow anyone to interfere in the affairs of our region.

    黎巴嫩对“艾森豪威尔主义”有两种反应
    许多人认为美国和英法是一丘之貉
    新华社12日讯　塔斯社贝鲁特11日讯：美国干涉中近东国家内政的“艾森豪威尔主义”的计划，在黎巴嫩引起了两种反应。
    “邻人报”说：“一方面，（黎巴嫩）总理拒绝对‘艾森豪威尔主义’表示意见，而在另一方面，外交部长又说，黎巴嫩赞同美国总统的计划。”
    拥护“艾森豪威尔主义”的人硬说，黎巴嫩要“独立”非得靠美国支持不可，因为英国和法国在近东的势力大大削弱了。除了这种意见以外，有许多著名的黎巴嫩政治活动家指出了“艾森豪威尔主义”的危险性。譬如，黎巴嫩前总理卡拉米在“政治报”上发表的文章中说，艾森豪威尔准备在中东执行的美国“新”政策也就是法国和英国执行过的那种政策。文章着重说，人民不允许任何人对我们这个地区的事务作任何干涉。
