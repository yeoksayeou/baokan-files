Xinhua News Agency Report: Hua Luogeng, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and famous mathematician, shared his impressions of scientific research work in Shaanxi Province with Xinhua News Agency reporters after inspecting work in Xi'an.

Hua Luogeng said: "This trip to Xi'an has been very exciting. This ancient capital has now not only become a new type of industrial city, but also a cultural center with a concentration of universities." He believes that scientific research work in Shaanxi Province has already had a good start, and this inspection gave him a vivid impression. What excites him most is the growth of new forces in the scientific community in Shaanxi Province. Hua Luogeng cited the recent Second Scientific Discussion Meeting of Northwest University as an example to illustrate this point. He said that among the 120 scientific papers discussed at the meeting, 26 were in mathematics, most of which were from new authors he was not familiar with. He went on to say that, of course, the number of papers is not enough to show that their scientific level is already very high, but the scientific research work here has just begun, and so many new soldiers have emerged, which symbolizes an unlimited future.

He then excitedly talked about the development of scientific undertakings in Shaanxi Province. He said that since liberation, Shaanxi Province has established scientific research institutions in agriculture and archeology, and organizations leading scientific circles to carry out academic activities have also been established. In particular, the number of universities has increased from two to twelve, and this force provides favorable conditions for Shaanxi Province to carry out scientific research work. He said that Shaanxi Province is an important agricultural area and a key industrial construction area in the country, and the development of industry and agriculture requires the support of science and technology. Although scientific research workers in Shaanxi Province have already taken action, it is still not commensurate with the requirements of industrial and agricultural construction and development. Therefore, he believes that the central government still needs to provide strong support for scientific research work in Shaanxi in the future.

Hua Luogeng also mentioned that during this inspection, he deeply realized the importance of formulating a reasonable national science plan. For example, the Northwest is a famous loess area, but it lacks the necessary strength to study loess, and it is necessary to transport loess by train to Harbin for experiments. Among the newly built engineering colleges in Xi'an, there are still overlapping majors. There are many universities in Shaanxi Province, but there are very few scientific research institutions. He believes that the establishment of universities and research institutions nationwide must have an overall layout, and cadres, books and materials must be rationally allocated after full consideration, and research topics must be coordinated and reduced to avoid duplication.

During his stay in Xi'an, Hua Luogeng visited many universities such as Northwest University and Jiaotong University, had extensive contact with teachers, students, and scientific research workers, and also gave academic speeches and held symposiums for scientific circles in Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City.

    数学家华罗庚谈视察观感
    科学界的新生力量成长很快
    新华社讯　视察了西安工作的全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员、著名数学家华罗庚，对新华社记者畅谈了陕西省的科学研究工作。
    华罗庚说：“这次到西安来，是十分兴奋的。这个古代名都现在不但已经成为新型的工业城市，而且也是一个高等学校集中的文化中心。”他认为，陕西省的科学研究工作已经有了一个良好的开端，这次视察给了他一个鲜明的印象。使他最感到兴奋的，是陕西省科学界新生力量的成长，华罗庚举出最近他参加的西北大学第二次科学讨论会为例说明这个问题。他说，这个会上讨论的一百二十篇科学论文中，数学方面的就占了二十六篇，其中绝大部分是他不熟悉的新作者。他接着说，当然论文的数量还不足以说明他们的科学水平已经很高了，但是这里的科学研究工作刚开始，就出现了这么多的新兵，这象征着未可限量的未来。
    接着他又兴奋地谈到陕西省科学事业的发展。他说，解放以来，陕西省已经建立了农业和考古方面的科学研究机构，领导科学界开展学术活动的组织也已经建立了，特别是高等学校从两所增加到十二所，这批力量给陕西省开展科学研究工作提供了有利的条件。他说，陕西省是全国重要的农业地区，也是工业重点建设地区，工农业的发展都需要科学技术的支援。陕西省的科学研究工作者虽然已经动起来了，但是从工农业建设发展的要求来看，还是不相称的。因此，他认为今后中央对于陕西的科学研究工作还需要加以大力支援。
    华罗庚还谈到，他在这次视察中对制定一个合理的全国科学规划的重要性体会很深。例如，西北是个有名的黄土地带，却缺乏研究黄土的应有力量，要用火车把黄土运到哈尔滨去进行试验。西安新建的几所工学院中，设立的专业还有互相重复的现象。陕西省的高等学校很多，但科学研究机构的教量却很少。他认为全国高等学校和研究机构的设置必须有一个总的布局，干部和图书资料等，必须经过充分的考虑合理地调配，研究题目必须协调和减少重复。
    华罗庚在西安期间，曾经到西北大学、交通大学等许多高等学校视察，同教师、学生、科学研究工作者作了广泛的接触，还向陕西省、西安市的科学界人士作了学术性的演讲和举行了座谈会。（附图片）
