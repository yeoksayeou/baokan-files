    The Cooperative Director Learned New Leadership Methods
    By Our Correspondent Gao Changren
    The Hexin Township Huanghua Agricultural Cooperative in Changsha County, Hunan Province, began rectification in late August last year.

    This cooperative had 245 households. In 1956, due to a severe drought, shortcomings in the cooperative's management, and undemocratic work style of the cooperative cadres, the total value of agricultural and sideline production decreased by 36% compared with 1955. After harvesting the early rice, some cooperative members became somewhat unstable. During the rectification, the members raised more than 100 criticisms of the management committee, demanding that the cooperative cadres change their work style and run the cooperative well.

    In the first ten days of the rectification, the cooperative director, He Zhengwen, was preoccupied and slept poorly at night. Almost all of the more than 100 sharp criticisms raised by the members were related to him. The members criticized him for "neither understanding, nor asking, nor learning," as if the cooperative's production decline was all his fault. He couldn't understand it. He thought: Although I am only a 22-year-old young man, I have been educated by the Party for more than three years, and in good conscience, I wholeheartedly wanted to run the cooperative well; I have worked hard for the cooperative for a year, even if I haven't achieved any merit. In the past, I received a lot of criticism from higher authorities, and now I am being "attacked" by the members like this, it really feels a bit unfair. The more he thought this way, the more he couldn't see straight, and he once planned: I'll just do it until the end of the year, and then I won't be the cooperative director anymore.

    After several branch meetings and the first members' representative assembly of the entire cooperative, his negative and backward thinking gradually changed. At these meetings, comrades from the work team, on behalf of the higher authorities, reviewed some subjective and bureaucratic errors in the leadership, explaining that most of the coercive orders of the cooperative cadres were the responsibility of the higher authorities. After the members raised their ideological awareness and distinguished right from wrong, they unanimously acknowledged that the main reason for the cooperative's production decline was still the drought; the cooperative cadres had shortcomings, but they also had merits. Many people said: The cooperative director was quite busy with everyone's affairs this year; although he has many shortcomings, he still wholeheartedly wants to run the cooperative well.

    At these meetings, He Zhengwen saw that both the leading comrades from higher authorities and the members were looking at the problem comprehensively and did not want him to bear all the responsibility for all the losses in the cooperative. At this time, he was able to think more calmly about his own shortcomings and carefully chew on the various criticisms from the members. Thus, many important events in the process of running the cooperative this year came back to him very clearly.

    In the spring, the higher authorities called for expanding the planting of double-cropping rice by 70%. Their cooperative originally only planned to plant 50%; he was criticized at a meeting in the township for being too conservative. After He Zhengwen returned, he resolutely implemented the task assigned by the township and wanted to complete the sowing area of 70% double-cropping rice. Thus, after a decision by several cooperative cadres, they were going to plow down 250 mu of wheat fields. The members were unwilling, but they didn't care, and by the time the higher authorities instructed them to correct it, 200 mu had already been plowed down. In the past, the members had the habit of growing economic crops such as ginger and watermelon, which did not occupy much cultivated land area and generated a large amount of cash income every year. Last year, in order to plant more double-cropping rice, these economic crops were squeezed out. During the spring plowing, the cooperative bought a batch of fertilizer in Changsha City. Because the cooperative cadres had just borrowed a sum of money from the government, they used a car to transport the fertilizer back, and the transportation cost alone wasted 1,200 yuan. …

    These losses added up to a considerable amount. Could these losses have been avoided? He Zhengwen couldn't help but think of the many opinions that the members had raised in the past. At that time, he dismissed all the members' opinions as "conservative ideas"; now it seems that these opinions were so pertinent and valuable. An incident that occurred before the rectification made him particularly sad. At that time, the early rice had already been harvested, and the middle rice was in the process of heading. The county instructed to vigorously rush-plant late rice, but in their cooperative, because the weather was dry and the pond water was limited, should they rescue the nearly mature middle rice, or rush-plant the late rice, the harvest of which was still uncertain? The members with production experience all firmly demanded to rescue the middle rice, because this was the grain that was about to be in their mouths; if the late rice couldn't be planted, they could still plant buckwheat. But He Zhengwen and several young cooperative cadres disregarded the conditions and insisted on doing things according to the instructions of the higher authorities, organizing the members to plant late rice with all their strength. Soon, the drought became more and more severe, and the newly planted late rice died, and the middle rice also suffered a production decline. From then on, those experienced old members who used to be willing to offer opinions stopped offering opinions. People said: "The cooperative is a leaky tank, and no matter how hard the members work to carry water, it can't be filled." People criticized the young cooperative cadres as "having no hair on their mouths, and not being reliable in their work," and already doubted whether they could lead well.

    Thinking of these things, He Zhengwen deeply realized that most of the opinions that the members had raised in the past were correct; he realized that although he had been loyal to the cooperative for the past year, his blindly reckless work style had indeed caused no small losses to the cooperative, and he truly felt sorry for these more than 200 households of members. He no longer felt that the members' criticisms were excessive and began to sincerely review the errors in his work style.

    In October, the rectification work came to an end, and all work became busy again. The cooperative had to carry out final accounting and distribution, and the county also assigned a series of tasks such as winter planting, winter plowing, water conservancy construction, and fertilizer accumulation. However, some of the projects assigned by the county were no longer feasible in this cooperative, because the water source was exhausted, and winter planting and winter plowing were impossible. What should be done? If it had been before the rectification, He Zhengwen would have simply assigned these tasks to the production teams and set a time limit for completion, but now it wouldn't work. He was very distressed in those few days. Suddenly, he remembered the three sentences that the members criticized him for during the rectification: "Neither understanding, nor asking, nor learning." He thought that he was indeed younger and had less production experience. Faced with this difficult problem, not learning and not asking wouldn't work. So, he took this difficult problem and visited Zhou Jieren, an old member in his seventies; then, he went to the homes of Liu Taiting and Liu Yuqing, who had production experience, to ask for advice.

    His visits were conducted separately, but these three people had a common suggestion for the leadership of production at that time, which was to quickly mobilize the members to carry pond mud. Liu Yuqing's remarks touched He Zhengwen even more. Liu Yuqing said: "There are four major difficulties in next year's production: first, the weather was dry this year, and no green manure was planted. Second, there will be very little of the large amount of soil manure that we had every year in the past, because it cannot be composted without water. Third, the members' private plots have increased somewhat this year, and the members' investment in household fertilizer next year will be less than this year. Fourth, the cooperative does not have a lot of surplus money to buy a large amount of fertilizer. These four major difficulties add up to one, which is a serious shortage of fertilizer. The only solution is to carry pond mud. Carrying pond mud has three major benefits: carrying one mu of pond mud more this year will save more than four yuan in costs next year; if the pond dries thoroughly this year and the pond mud is easy to carry, carrying one chi deeper will allow it to store one chi more of water next year; if we complete the fertilizer accumulation task this winter, we can concentrate our efforts on spring plowing next spring." Liu Yuqing repeatedly urged him: "If you don't mobilize to carry pond mud this year, you will make a big mistake next year."

    It was the first time for He Zhengwen to absorb such valuable opinions from the masses of members. He excitedly told Comrade Tang from the work team about the members' opinions, and Comrade Tang also felt that the problem was important and suggested that they hold a meeting to discuss it. That night, the cooperative cadres held a meeting. Before the meeting, he specially invited Liu Yuqing to speak to the cooperative cadres again about the importance of accumulating fertilizer and digging pond mud. The cooperative cadres unanimously agreed with this method. The cooperative cadres quickly divided the work to eleven production teams, explained the rationale clearly, and called on them to accumulate fertilizer. After all the members understood that this was the key issue for production in 1957, everyone took action. The cooperative's original plan to cover 1,000 mu of fields with pond mud had already completed 40% by early December.

    He Zhengwen received favorable comments from the members for mobilizing fertilizer accumulation. Some old members, who previously thought that He Zhengwen would not adopt the opinions of the elderly, took the initiative to offer many suggestions to He Zhengwen. Zhou Jieren saw that the cooperative quickly turned his suggestions into action, and he was particularly concerned about He Zhengwen whenever he saw him. Once, he saw He Zhengwen and said: "Winter is coming, we must pay attention to protecting the cooperative's cattle!"

    From the fertilizer accumulation event, He Zhengwen had an even deeper understanding. In the past, whenever he mechanically applied the instructions of the higher authorities and the experiences of other places to the cooperative, it would take a lot of effort. During the implementation, his only method was to go down to personally inspect. However, often when he inspected this team, that team would violate his instructions, which really gave him a headache. This time, because the task of deploying pond mud digging was in line with the actual situation of the cooperative, everyone quickly started working.

    In leading the year-end distribution work, in addition to continuing to pay attention to going deep down and soliciting the opinions of the members, He Zhengwen also worked with everyone to establish a democratic system within the cooperative. Major matters were discussed by the management committee or at the members' representative assembly. Before the rectification, a members' representative assembly had never been held; after the rectification, it had already been held four times. In this way, many problems that the cooperative cadres could not solve in the past were successfully resolved. For example, in the distribution, it was necessary to propose a bonus of 200 yuan to reward the four production teams with production achievements. According to the previous method, several cooperative committee members could decide to distribute 50 yuan to each team; however, this time, at the cooperative committee meeting, everyone believed that in order to make this money play a role in encouraging production, it was necessary to seriously evaluate the conditions so that the teams with greater achievements could get more. For this reason, they convened three or four management committee and production team leader meetings to compare them in detail. Finally, according to everyone's opinions, the seventh team was awarded 60 yuan, the second team was awarded 50 yuan, and the tenth and fifth teams were awarded 45 yuan each. After such careful handling, everyone had no objections. He Zhengwen and the management committee members repeatedly studied many specific issues in the distribution and passed them at the members' representative assembly to be reasonably resolved.

    The leadership style of the cooperative director changed, and he handled many specific issues according to the opinions of the majority of the members, which enhanced the members' confidence in running the cooperative well. Originally, there were more than 20 households of members who were preparing to withdraw from the cooperative due to the undemocratic work style of the cooperative cadres and fear of ruining the cooperative, but they became firm again. When the members recently醞釀to reorganize the leadership structure, at the members' symposium in each team, people unanimously expressed that they wanted to elect He Zhengwen as the cooperative director.

    社主任学会了新的领导方法
    本报记者　高长任
    湖南省长沙县合心乡黄花农业社在去年8月下旬开始整顿。
    这个社有二百四十五户，1956年因为受到严重的旱灾和社内经营管理有缺点，加上社干部作风不民主，全社农副业总产值比1955年减少了36％。在收割早稻以后，部分社员的情绪就有些不安定。整社的时候，社员们对管委会提了一百多条批评意见，大家要求社干部转变作风，把社办好。
    在整社开始的那十来天，社主任何政文心事重重，晚上睡不好觉。社员们提出的一百多条尖锐的批评，差不多都是同他有关的。社员们批评他“既不懂，又不问，也不学”，仿佛社里减产都怪他一个人似的。他很想不通。他想：虽然自己才是一个二十二岁的年轻人，但受党的教育已有三年多，凭良心说，自己是全心全意想把社办好的；办社一年，没有功劳有苦劳。过去受到上级不少的批评，现在又受到社员们这样的“打击”，真有点冤枉。越朝这边想，就越转不过弯来，他曾经打算：搞到年底就算了，我这个社主任也不当了。
    在开过多次的支部会和全社第一次社员代表大会以后，他那种消极后退的思想才逐步扭转过来。在这些会议上，工作组的同志们代表上级，检讨了领导方面的一些主观主义和官僚主义的错误，说明社干部的许多强迫命令的作风大部分是要由上级负责的。社员们在提高思想、分清是非之后，也一致承认社里减产的主要原因还是受了旱灾；社干部有缺点，但是也有功劳。很多人说：社主任这一年为大家的事忙的不轻；虽然有不少缺点，但他还是一心想把社办好的。
    在这些会议上，何政文看到不论上级领导同志和社员，对问题还是看得很全面的，并没有把社内一切损失都要他来担当。这时，他就能够比较冷静地想想自己的缺点，细细咀嚼来自社员的各种批评意见。于是，这一年办社过程中许多重要事件，就非常清楚地回想起来了。
    春天，上级号召扩种70％的双季稻。他们社里原来只计划种50％；他在乡里开会，受到别人的批评，认为他们太保守。何政文回来以后，坚决执行乡里布置的任务，要完成70％双季稻的播种面积。于是，几个社干部一决定，就要犁掉二百五十亩麦田。社员们不愿意，他们也不管，直到上级指示纠正的时候，已经犁掉二百亩了。过去，社员们都有种生姜、西瓜等经济作物的习惯，占用耕地面积不多，每年都有很大一笔现金收入。去年为了多种双季稻，把这些经济作物都挤掉了。春耕的时候，社里在长沙市买了一批肥料。社干部因为刚从政府贷到一笔款，就用汽车把肥料运回来，光这笔运费就浪费了一千二百元。……
    这些损失加起来是一笔不小的数目。能不能避免这些损失呢？何政文不由地想到社员们过去提的许多意见来。当时，他还把社员们的意见一概称为“保守思想”；现在看来，这些意见是多么中肯和宝贵啊。整社以前发生的一件事，使他特别难过。那时候，早稻已经割完，中稻正在孕穗，县里指示要大力抢插晚稻，而他们社里因为天气干旱、塘水有限，究竟是抢救快成熟的中稻，还是抢插收成尚无把握的晚稻呢？有生产经验的社员都坚决要求抢救中稻，因为这是就要到口的粮食；晚稻插不下去，还可以种荞麦。而何政文和几个年青的社干部却不顾条件，硬要照上级指示办事，组织社员全力插晚秧。不久，天越旱越厉害，刚插下的晚稻干死了，中稻也减产了。从此，原来那些肯提意见的有生产经验的老社员也不再提意见了。人们说：“社里是一口漏水缸，社员再下力挑水，也挑不满。”人们批评年青的社干部是“嘴上没毛，做事不牢”，已经怀疑他们能不能领导好了。
    想到这些事情，何政文才深刻地认识到社员们过去提的意见，绝大部分是正确的；认识到自己办社一年来虽然忠心为社，但是一味蛮干的作风的确给社里造成不小的损失，他真正感觉到对不起这二百多户社员了。他再不感到社员们的批评过火，开始诚恳地检讨自己工作作风上的错误。			×××
    10月间，整社工作告一段落，一切工作又繁忙起来了，社里要进行决算分配，县里也布置了冬种、冬耕、修水利、积肥料等一系列的任务。但县里布置的任务，有些项目在这个社已经行不通，因为水源枯竭，冬种、冬耕都不可能进行了，这该怎么办呢？要是在整社以前，何政文又会那么简单地把这些任务分配到生产队，限期完成，但是现在不成了，他在那几天非常苦恼。忽然，他记起整社的时候社员批评他的三句话：“既不懂，又不问，也不学。”他想，自己是年轻一些，生产经验少，碰到这个难题，不学、不问是不行的。于是，他带着这个难题，去拜访七十多岁的老社员周介仁；接着，又到有生产经验的柳太亭和柳玉卿的家里请教。
    他的访问是分别进行的，但这三个人对当时生产的领导，都有一个共同的建议，就是赶快发动社员挑塘泥。柳玉卿的一段话，更打动了何政文。柳玉卿说：“明年的生产有四大困难：一是今年天干，没有种下绿肥。二是过去年年都有的大批土粪，明年也很少，因为没有水就沤不成。三是今年社员自留地增加了一些，社员明年的家肥投资要比今年少。四是社里也没有很多余钱买大批肥料。这四大困难合起来是一个，就是肥料严重缺乏。解决办法只有一个，就是挑塘泥。挑塘泥有三大好处：今年多挑一亩塘泥，明年就可节省四元多的成本；今年塘干透了、塘泥好挑，多挑一尺深，明年可以多蓄一尺水；今冬把积肥任务完成了，明春可以集中力量搞春耕。”柳玉卿一再叮嘱他：“你们今年不发动挑塘泥，明年就要犯大错误。”
    在社员群众中吸取了这么宝贵的意见，在何政文说来还是头一次。他兴冲冲地把社员们的意见告诉工作组的唐同志，唐同志也认为问题重要，建议他们开会讨论。当天晚上，社干部就开了会。会前，他特地把柳玉卿找来，向社干部们又讲一番积肥料挖塘泥的重要性。社干部一致赞成这个办法。社干部很快就分工到十一个生产队，讲清道理，号召积肥。在全体社员们明白这是1957年生产的关键问题以后，大家都行动起来。社里原订把一千亩田都布满塘泥的计划，12月上旬已经完成了40％。
    发动积肥这件事，何政文得到了社员们的好评。过去认为何政文不会采纳老年人意见的一些老社员，又都主动向何政文提出许多建议。周介文看到社里很快地把他的建议变成行动，以后见到何政文就特别关切。有一次，他见到何政文就说：“冬天到了，社里的耕牛可得注意保护呵！”
    从积肥这一件事上，何政文更有深切的体会。过去，每当他把上级指示和别处经验生搬硬套在社内贯彻执行的时候，总要费九牛二虎之力。执行当中，他唯一的办法是亲自下去检查。但是，往往他在这个队检查，那个队又违反了他的指示，真是伤透了脑筋。这一次布置挖塘泥的任务，因为合乎社里实际情况，大家就很快地干起来了。
    在领导年终分配的工作当中，何政文除了仍然注意深入下去，征求社员意见之外，还同大家一起把社内一套民主制度建立了起来。重大的事都经过管委会讨论，或者开社员代表大会讨论。整社以前，一次社员代表大会也没开过；整社以后，已经开过四次了。这样，许多过去几个社干部不能解决的问题，都顺利地解决了。例如，在分配中要提出二百元奖金，奖励生产有成绩的四个生产队，要照过去的办法，几个社委就可以决定，一个队分给五十元就算了；可是，这一次在社委会上研究，大家认为要使这笔钱起到鼓励生产的作用，就得认真评评条件，使成绩大的队能够多得。为此，他们就召开了三、四次管委会和生产队长会，详细评比。最后，根据大家的意见，奖给七队六十元、二队五十元，十队和五队各四十五元。经过这样细致地处理，大家都没有意见。分配中的许多具体问题，何政文和管理委员们都是这样反复研究，在社员代表大会上通过，得到合理解决的。
    社主任领导作风转变了，处理许多具体问题都照大多数社员意见办事，就增强了社员们办好社的信心。原来有二十多户因社干部作风不民主、怕把社办垮而准备退社的社员，又坚定下来了。在最近社员们酝酿改选领导机构的时候，在每一个队的社员座谈会上，人们都一致表示还要选举何政文做社主任。
