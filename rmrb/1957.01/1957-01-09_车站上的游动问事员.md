    Mobile Information Staff at the Train Station

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Changchun Railway Station recently added mobile information staff to handle transfer visa procedures for passengers and sell platform tickets.

    In the past, the area outside the information desk at Changchun Railway Station was always crowded with many passengers, anxiously waiting to inquire about train schedules, transfer locations, and to handle transfer visa procedures. Often, due to the urgency of time and the crowded conditions, arguments would break out, causing dissatisfaction among passengers. Now, with mobile information staff moving around in the waiting room to help passengers solve various problems, passengers are very satisfied.

    车站上的游动问事员
    据新华社讯　长春车站最近增添了游动问事员，为旅客办理转车签证手续，代售站台票。
    过去，长春车站问事处外面总是排队拥挤着许多旅客，他们焦急地等候询问火车时刻、转车地点和办理转车签证手续等，常常由于时间紧迫、拥挤不堪而发生争吵，引起旅客不满。现在有了游动问事员，在候车室各处游动，帮助旅客解决各种问题，旅客非常满意。
