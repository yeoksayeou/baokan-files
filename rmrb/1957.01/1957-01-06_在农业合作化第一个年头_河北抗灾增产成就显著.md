Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, January 5th. Hebei Province, which achieved advanced agricultural cooperativization relatively early, saw significant achievements in disaster resistance and increased production in 1956, the first year after cooperativization. Although over one-third of the crops suffered severe flooding, the total output of grain and peanuts was still equal to 91% and 97% of 1955, respectively, and both exceeded the production level of 1954, a year of severe disaster. Due to the more severe disaster in cotton-growing areas, the total cotton output of the province was only 75% of 1955. According to preliminary statistics from nine special districts and seven cities, among the seven thousand three hundred and seventy-seven agricultural cooperatives, excluding those affected by floods, nearly 80% increased production, and slightly less than 15% maintained their original production levels. In the three special districts of Tangshan, Chengde, and Zhangjiakou, 81% of the cooperative members increased their income.

Hebei Province suffered severe flooding in August 1956. At that time, the agricultural cooperatives along the rivers organized more than 1.5 million people into flood prevention teams, who, under the command of flood control agencies at all levels, fought against the floods,抢险护堤. Nearly ten thousand agricultural cooperatives in the flood-stricken areas also implemented unified flood prevention and drainage measures based on local terrain and water conditions to protect crops. The large-scale water and soil conservation and ditch and terraced field projects built throughout the province after cooperativization also played a role in flood control and water storage. Therefore, the flooded area was greatly reduced. The agricultural cooperatives in flood-affected areas also uniformly planned, dug ditches for drainage, rescued crops, salvaged remnants of the autumn harvest, and replanted late crops to compensate for flood damage. After the rescue of the three million four hundred thousand mu of cotton fields in Handan Special District, which suffered flooding to varying degrees, the loss of twenty million jin of cotton was reduced. Due to the timely salvage of the autumn harvest, many flood-affected corn and millet fields also yielded 30 to 50 jin per mu. In addition, five hundred thousand mu of buckwheat and vegetables were also replanted.

In the low-lying areas of Tianjin and Cangxian Special Districts, production reforms were promoted in accordance with local conditions on the basis of agricultural cooperativization. In the Tuanbowa and Lianhuadian areas of Jinghai and Ba County in Tianjin Special District alone, more than twenty polder areas saw local agricultural cooperatives invest seven million labor days to build seventy-four water conservancy projects, including more than twenty million cubic meters of earthwork and nearly one thousand culverts and sluice gates. Moreover, rice was replanted in these polder areas, which had suffered from floods nine years out of ten in the past, as well as paddy rice, upland rice, and corn. When the flood came, although these polder areas were also a vast expanse of water, the water surface was swaying with heavy ears of rice. According to preliminary statistics, after the production reform, the 3.8 million mu of polder land yielded about 800 million jin of grain in the autumn, which is equal to the total grain output of Tianjin Special District in 1954, a year of flooding.

After cooperativization, agricultural cooperatives in various regions also adopted a series of measures to increase production. Wells were drilled to expand the irrigated area by more than 16 million mu throughout the province, and two to three times more fertilizer was accumulated than in previous years. Due to increased fertilizer application, timely irrigation, and strengthened field management, the province harvested 600 million jin more grain in the summer of 1956 than in the summer of 1955. The expansion of the area of high-yield crops such as corn, potatoes, and rice also increased production by 1.1 billion jin compared to planting other miscellaneous grains. Agricultural cooperatives in various regions promoted a system of contracted labor and individual responsibility for field management during the rainy dog days, timely cultivating, weeding, and topdressing, eliminating ten million mu of weed-infested land and eradicating more than twenty million mu of cotton aphids, locusts, and other pests. This created conditions for disaster resistance and guaranteed harvest in disaster-affected areas, while also ensuring a bumper harvest in non-disaster-affected areas.

    在农业合作化第一个年头
    河北抗灾增产成就显著
    新华社保定5日电　实现农业高级合作化较早的河北省，在合作化以后第一个年头1956年，虽然有三分之一以上的农作物遭受严重水灾，但是粮食、花生总产量仍分别等于1955年的91％和97％，而且都超过重灾年份1954年的生产水平。由于棉区受灾较重，全省棉花总产量只相当于1955年的75％。据九个专区七个市的初步统计，除了遭受水灾的农业社以外，在七千三百七十七个农业社中，增产的占近80％，保持原来产量的占15％弱。唐山、承德、张家口三个专区有81％的社员增加了收入。
    河北省在1956年8月遭受严重水灾。当时沿河的农业社组织起一百五十多万人的防汛队伍，在各级防汛机构的指挥下同洪水搏斗，抢险护堤。而水灾区的近万个农业社也根据当地的地势水情，统一防水疏水，保护庄稼。全省在合作化以后大规模兴修的水土保持、沟洫畦田等工程，也发挥了拦洪蓄水的作用。因此，大大缩小了淹地面积。洪水成灾地区的农业社又统一计划，分头挖沟排水，抢救庄稼，打捞残秋，抢种晚田，弥补水灾损失。邯郸专区遭受不同程度水灾的三百四十万亩棉田，经过抢救以后，就少损失棉花两千万斤。由于及时打捞残秋，许多受水灾的玉米、谷子每亩也收了三、五十斤。此外，还抢种上五十万亩荞麦和蔬菜。
    天津、沧县等专区低洼地区在农业合作化的基础上，因地制宜地推行了生产改革。单是天津专区静海、霸县等县的团泊洼、莲花淀等二十多个洼淀，当地农业社用七百万个劳动日兴修了包括二千多万土方工程、近一千座涵闸的七十四项水利工程，并且在这些过去十年九涝的洼地里改种了水稻，淀稻、旱稻和玉米。当洪水到来后，虽然这些洼地也是一片汪洋，但是水面上摇摆着结实累累的稻穗。据初步统计，经过生产改革以后的三百八十万亩洼地，秋季收获粮食八亿斤左右，等于1954年受水灾的天津专区全年的粮食产量。
    合作化以后，各地农业社还采取了一系列的增产措施。全省打井扩大浇地面积一千六百多万亩，肥料比往年多积了两三倍。由于增施肥料、适时浇水和加强田间管理，全省1956年夏季比1955年夏季多收了六亿斤粮食。玉米、薯类和稻子等高产作物面积的扩大，也比播种其他杂粮作物增产了十一亿斤。各地农业社在多雨的伏天推行包工和田间管理的个人负责制，及时中耕锄草和追肥，消灭了一千万亩草荒，扑灭了两千多万亩棉蚜、飞蝗等虫害。这样，给灾区的抗灾保收创造了条件，同时保证了非灾区的丰收。
