    The Housing Potential in Lüda City Is Great
    Mao Xianzhi
    In recent years, buildings in the suburbs of Lüda have been expanding outwards. Blocks of worker housing and new sanatoriums and cultural areas have been established one after another. On some of the original open spaces in the city, new buildings have sprung up. According to statistics from the Lüda Urban Construction Bureau from 1953 to 1956 alone, the civil buildings constructed by them amounted to more than 1.3 million square meters. If we add the construction by other units, the number would be even larger. Therefore, although the population of Lüda is constantly increasing, the living conditions of the people have greatly improved. Before liberation, the average living area per person was only 1.1 square meters (not referring to construction area), but now it has increased to 3.18 square meters.
    However, despite this, housing shortage is still a serious problem in Lüda. According to statistics from the Lüda real estate department in August last year, more than 20,000 households have applied for housing allocation. Based on this situation, it is absolutely necessary for Lüda City to build an appropriate number of dormitories in the industrial area in the future. However, because the country must currently concentrate its main efforts on key construction projects, it can only allocate limited funds to appropriately build new dormitories, and it is impossible to meet all needs at once. Therefore, in order to solve the housing shortage, we must fully tap the potential of existing housing.
    Judging from the current usage of housing in Lüda, the potential of housing is still very large. Among them, the office space has the greatest potential. Because many agencies and departments emphasize the uniqueness of their business and are unwilling to work together, some agencies emphasize the need to "keep some spare houses" and "develop in the future," and are unwilling to vacate surplus houses. Therefore, the waste of office space is very serious. The office building of the Lüda Municipal People's Committee recently squeezed a bit and vacated more than 1,000 square meters of houses, which allowed three new bureaus to move in for office work. This is indicative of the general situation. It is estimated that if all units resolutely economize on office space, the city can save about 10,000 square meters of building area of office space.
    Not only is there waste of office space in government agencies, but also in factories and enterprises. The Dalian Railway Sub-bureau wastes the most. Some section chiefs occupy a large office alone, with a conference table inside. Some are offices occupied by section chiefs and deputy section chiefs, working separately from the staff. The trade union of the Lüda Machinery Company has only three people, but occupies two large offices. The Party committee, with six people, also occupies three offices, and one is still idle. Some units, due to their large organization and excessive personnel, also cause waste of housing. For example, the Lüda Vegetable Company recently underwent two organizational adjustments, and it is initially estimated that it can reduce personnel by more than 40%, which can free up a lot of office space.
    Insufficient dormitories are a more frequently discussed issue in Lüda. In fact, there is also great potential in dormitory housing. Some units only complain about insufficient dormitories, but have not taken steps to overcome the waste of dormitories. For example, some cadres and workers' families occupy too much housing, and some collective dormitories are not fully occupied according to the quota, which wastes a lot of housing. As long as we think more about this aspect, we can free up a lot of dormitories. The Dalian Chemical Plant recently made an adjustment to the staff dormitory and vacated more than 100 rooms. The Lüda Worker-Peasant Cadre Cultural School adjusted the student dormitory, and recently vacated a collective dormitory with a construction area of more than 1,000 square meters. In addition, some buildings can be used as dormitories after appropriate repairs and renovations. The potential in this area should not be ignored. The Dalian Railway Sub-bureau used this method to solve the housing problems of more than 80 employees.
    It should be especially pointed out that many bureau-level and above cadres in Lüda have too much housing. Many families occupy one, two or even more times the prescribed living area. In the case of such a lack of housing, the masses are dissatisfied with the leaders occupying too much housing. Some comrades have already taken the initiative to vacate surplus houses, which not only taps the potential of housing, but more importantly, shares weal and woe with the people and strengthens ties with the people.
    The potential of dormitory housing is also reflected in private housing. Some private homeowners have too much housing. According to a survey, if the vacant private houses in the city are vacated, housing problems can be solved for more than 600 employees. Therefore, if we can do a good job of persuasion and education to private homeowners and mobilize them to rent out surplus houses, this can also solve the problem of housing shortage for some employees.
    In addition, there are many phenomena of wasting housing that are often overlooked. One situation is unreasonable use of housing. Like the bustling Tianjin Street intersection, there is a tall building, and the first floor is most suitable for a store, but the Dalian Shipbuilding Company uses this building as a guest house, and only piles up some things on the first floor, and half of it is idle. Tianjin Street has four or five spacious and beautiful large marketplaces, which should be used as storefronts for shops, but they are occupied by several wholesale stores that only receive a few buyers every day. Another situation is that warehouses, nurseries, etc. occupy too much housing. The nursery, barber shop, garage, etc. of the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee occupy more than 1,200 square meters of housing. The Dalian Timber Furniture Store has enough warehouse space of 1,600 to 1,700 square meters, but now occupies 2,500 square meters. The third situation is that there are too many clubs. Now, almost every government agency or factory enterprise has a club. Due to the excessive number of clubs, the utilization rate is very low. If several units can share a club and rationally allocate the usage time, then many houses can be saved by reducing the number of clubs. The nurseries in some units often only take in three or four children, but they occupy dozens of square meters of housing. If they jointly run nurseries and guest houses with neighboring units, they can also save certain manpower, materials, and housing. Many units' guest houses, if they can be jointly operated, can also achieve the same effect. The fourth situation is that sanatoriums and amateur sanatoriums have caused serious waste of housing due to decentralized management and decentralized use. The sanatorium run by the Ministry of Communications in Dalian occupies a total of nine buildings, but has only 42 beds (originally 50), while there are often only six or seven to more than ten recuperating members. At the end of July, when the Lüda Real Estate Administration sent people to understand the usage of the houses, they found that three or four buildings of the sanatorium were locked. When they opened them, the brand-new red lacquered floor was covered with "white hair," and the leather sofas were also covered with "clothes hair" and emitted a foul smell. The Dalian Sanatorium of the Ministry of Commerce occupies 33 buildings, but in fact only 15 buildings are used for recuperation, and four of these 15 buildings are often idle. In addition, many larger factories in Lüda have amateur sanatoriums, and the utilization rate is not high. Based on this situation, if all the sanatoriums and amateur sanatoriums in the city are uniformly managed and uniformly allocated for use, the utilization rate can be improved. Reducing or shrinking some sanatoriums and amateur sanatoriums can also save some housing.
    Based on the above situation, it can be seen that if the potential of housing is tapped in many ways, the current tight situation of insufficient housing can be greatly alleviated without the state making a large amount of investment.
    Lüda City is recently preparing to make an adjustment to the city's housing. Now only a few units have made preliminary adjustments, and they have vacated about 7,000 square meters of buildings. It is estimated that if the potential of office space, dormitories, and private houses is tapped, and housing is used to its full potential, then the vacated houses can solve the housing problems for at least 1,000 employees. This means that the country has saved an investment of about 2 million yuan in dormitory construction.

    旅大市房屋的潜力很大
    毛先智
    近几年来，旅大近郊的建筑物在不断向外扩展。一片片的职工住宅和新的疗养区、文化区已相继建立起来。市内原有的一些空地上，耸立起了一幢幢的新楼房。仅据旅大城市建设局从1953到1956年的统计，由他们施工的民用建筑就达一百三十多万平方公尺，如果加上其它单位施工的，则数字要更大一些。因此虽然旅大人口在不断增加，人民的居住条件却有了很大的改善。解放前，这里平均每人只有一点一平方公尺的居住面积（不是指建筑面积），而现在已增加到三点一八平方公尺了。
    但是尽管如此，房屋不足仍然是旅大的严重问题。据旅大房产部门去年8月份的统计，要求分配房屋的人已经有两万多户。根据这种情况，旅大市今后准备在工业区再新建适当数量的宿舍，是完全必要的。但是因为目前国家必须集中主要力量进行重点建设，只能拿出有限的钱适当地新建宿舍，不可能一下子满足全部需要。因此为了解决房屋的不足，必须充分挖掘现有房屋的潜力。
    从目前旅大房屋的使用情况来看，房屋的潜力还是很大的。其中潜力最大的是办公用房。因为有许多机关和部门强调业务特殊，不肯合在一起办公，有些机关强调要“留点机动房子”、“将来要发展”，不肯把多余的房子腾出来，因此办公用房的浪费是很严重的。旅大市人民委员会办公大楼最近挤了一挤，就腾出了一千多平方公尺的房子，可新搬进去三个局办公。由此可见一般。据估计，如果各单位坚决节约办公用房，全市大约可节约一万多平方公尺建筑面积的办公用房。
    办公用房不但机关有浪费，工厂企业也同样有浪费。大连铁路分局浪费最大。有的科长一个人占用一个大办公室，里边还摆会议桌。有的是正副科长占用一个办公室，和科员分开办公。旅大机械公司工会只有三个人，却占用了两间很大的办公室。党委六个人，也占用了三间办公室，现在还闲着一间。有些单位，由于机构庞大，人员过多，也造成房屋的浪费。如旅大蔬菜公司最近经过两次调整机构，初步估计可以减少人员40％多，这就可以腾出很多办公用房来。
    宿舍不够，这在旅大是谈论得更多的问题。其实，宿舍房屋也大有潜力。有些单位只是喊宿舍不够，但是对于宿舍的浪费没有去加以克服。比如有些干部和职工的家庭占房过多，有些集体宿舍没有按定员住满，这些都浪费了不少的房屋。只要在这方面多想办法，就可以腾出很多宿舍来。大连化学厂最近将职工宿舍作了一次调整，就腾出了一百多间房子。旅大工农干部文化学校把学生宿舍调整了一下，最近就腾出了一幢建筑面积达一千多平方公尺的集体宿舍。另外，有一些建筑物经过适当修整改造后，就可以当宿舍用。这方面的潜力也是不可忽视的。大连铁路分局就用这种办法，为八十多户职工解决了住房问题。
    应该特别提出的是旅大许多处、局长以上的干部住房过多。很多人家的居住面积超过了规定一倍、两倍甚至还多。在房屋这样缺乏的情况下，领导同志占用房屋过多，群众是不满意的。现在已经有的同志在主动地把多余的房子腾出来，这不只是挖掘了房屋的潜力，更重要的是和人民群众共甘苦，加强和人民群众的联系。
    宿舍房屋的潜力，还表现在私有房屋方面。有些私人房主住房过多，据调查，如果把全市空闲着的私人房屋腾出来，就可为六百多户职工解决住房问题。因此，如果能很好地向私人房主进行说服教育，动员他们出租多余的房屋，这也可以解决一部分职工缺房的问题。
    另外，还有许多浪费房屋的现象往往被人们所忽视。有一种情况是房屋使用不合理。像繁华的天津街十字路口，有一幢高大的楼房，下边一层做商店是最合适的，但是大连造船公司把这幢楼房做招待所，下边的一层只堆放了一些东西，另外还闲着一半。天津街有四、五个宽敞漂亮的大卖场，本应作商店的门市部，但是被几个每天只接待几个采买员的批发商店占去了。另一种情况是仓库、托儿所等占用房屋过多。中共旅大市委的托儿所、理发室、车库等共多占用了一千二百多平方公尺的房屋。大连制材厂家俱商店有一千六七百平方公尺的仓库就够了，现在却占用了二千五百平方公尺。第三种情况是俱乐部过多。现在不论大小机关或工厂企业，差不多都有一个俱乐部。由于俱乐部过多，运用率是很低的。如果能够做到几个单位共用一个俱乐部，并合理分配使用时间，那么就可以从减少俱乐部这方面节约许多房屋。有些单位的托儿所经常只收三四个小孩，但也占用了好几十平方公尺的房屋，如果和邻近的单位合办托儿所和招待所，也可以节约一定的人力、物力和房屋。许多单位的招待所，如果能够合办，也可以收到同样的效果。第四种情况是疗养院和业余疗养所由于分散管理和分散使用，也造成了房屋的严重浪费。交通部在大连办的疗养所，共占用了九幢房屋，但只有四十二个床位（原来是五十个），而休养员则经常只有六七人到十多人。7月末，旅大房地产管理局派人去了解房屋使用情况时，发现这个疗养所的三四幢房屋在锁着，打开一看，崭新的红漆地板长满了“白毛”，牛皮沙发也长了“衣毛”，并发出恶味。商业部大连疗养院占用了三十三幢房屋，但是实际上作疗养用的只有十五幢，而这十五幢中又有四幢经常空闲着。另外，旅大许多较大的工厂都有业余疗养所，使用率也不高。根据这种情况，如果对全市所有疗养院和业余疗养所，加以统一管理和统一分配使用，就可以提高使用率。减少或缩小一部分疗养院和业余疗养所也可以节约一部分房屋。
    根据以上情况，可以看出，如果从多方面挖掘房屋的潜力，就可以在国家不作大量投资的情况下，使目前房屋不够的紧张局面得到很大程度的缓和。
    旅大市最近准备对全市的房屋作一次调整。现在只是几个单位初步调整了一下，就腾出了约七千平方公尺的楼房。据估计：如果把办公用房、宿舍及私有房屋的潜力都挖掘出来，做到房尽其用，那么腾出的房子至少可以为一千多户职工解决住房问题。这也就是说等于为国家节约了约二百万元宿舍建筑的投资。
