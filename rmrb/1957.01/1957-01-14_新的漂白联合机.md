    New Bleaching Combined Machine

    The new product – a new type of rope bleaching combined machine – trial-produced by the state-owned Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory has been successful and the test run results are good.

    This combined bleaching machine is 50 meters long and can bleach 21,600 meters of cloth per hour, which is three-quarters higher than the production efficiency of the bleaching machines currently used in various printing and dyeing factories in China. The fabrics bleached by this machine, after printing and dyeing, have patterns that appear particularly bright and beautiful.

    新的漂白联合机
    国营郑州纺织机械厂试制的新产品——新型绳状漂白联合机已经成功，试车效果良好。
    这种联合漂白机全长五十公尺，每小时可漂白二万一千六百公尺布，比我国现在各印染厂所用的漂白机的生产效率高四分之三。用这种机器漂白出来的布匹，印染后，花纹显得格外鲜明、美观。
