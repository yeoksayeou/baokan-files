    Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd, New York dispatch: The Algerian National Liberation Front delegation submitted a letter to the President of the United Nations General Assembly on the 22nd, requesting the United Nations to find a way to stop the French authorities' policy of "eliminating the entire Algerian nation" in Algeria.

    In the letter, the Algerian National Liberation Front delegation stated that, even according to French official materials, 18,060 Algerians were killed in 1956. "In terms of Algerian sacrifices, French statistics should be considered greatly reduced, because entire towns and villages were wiped off the face of the earth after bombings, and men, women and children died in the ruins."

    The letter also pointed out that Europeans in Algeria often carry out lynching against Algerians under the protection of the police. The French government is currently trying to suppress the general strike to be held by the Algerian people with terror and bloodshed. This strike is to express support for the Algerian National Liberation Front delegation now at the United Nations.

    Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: According to the German News Agency, Rabi Bouhali, First Secretary of the Algerian Communist Party, currently in Berlin, told reporters from the German News Agency that Algerian residents are willing to resolve the conflict with the French government peacefully through negotiations, and they expect the United Nations to give them support. However, Bouhali pointed out that, due to the French government's tricks, the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of this issue may not produce the results people expect, and the Algerian people rely primarily on their own strength.

    Bouhali said that all the strength of the Algerian people is participating in the liberation struggle. He said that the Communist Party supports the National Liberation Front because its program contains important content that the Communists agree with. However, French imperialism is trying to use the contact between the liberation movement and the Communist Party to falsely claim that the Algerian liberation movement is led by the Communists. He pointed out that the French government is trying to use this claim to win over other Western countries to join it in opposing the Algerian people.

    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线
    要求联合国制止法国实行灭种政策
    阿共领袖表示支持民族解放阵线
    新华社23日讯　纽约消息：阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线代表团22日交给联合国大会主席一份信件，要求联合国设法制止法国当局在阿尔及利亚实行的“把阿尔及利亚整个民族都消灭掉”的政策。
    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线代表团在信中说，就是根据法国官方材料，1956年就有一万八千零六十个阿尔及利亚人被杀死，“在有关阿尔及利亚人牺牲这方面，法国的统计应当认为是被大大缩小的，因为轰炸之后整个村镇都从地面上消灭了，男人、女人和儿童也就死于废墟中”。
    信中还指出，在阿尔及利亚的欧洲人经常在警察庇护下对阿尔及利亚人实行私刑。法国政府目前正在设法用恐怖和血腥手段镇压阿尔及利亚人民要举行的总罢工，这次罢工是为了表示支持现在在联合国的阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线代表团。
    新华社23日讯　据德意志通讯社消息，目前在柏林的阿尔及利亚共产党第一书记拉比·布哈利向德意志通讯社记者发表谈话说，阿尔及利亚居民愿意通过谈判方式和平解决同法国政府的冲突，他们期待着联合国给他们支持。但是，布哈利指出，由于法国政府玩弄花样，联合国大会对这个问题的讨论也可能不会产生人们预期的结果，阿尔及利亚人民所依靠的首先是自己的力量。
    布哈利说，阿尔及利亚人民的一切力量都参加了解放斗争。他说，共产党支持民族解放阵线，因为它的纲领包含着共产党人所赞同的重要内容。但是，法帝国主义企图利用解放运动和共产党之间的接触，硬说阿尔及利亚解放运动是由共产党人领导的。他指出，法国政府企图用这种说法拉拢其他西方国家同它一道来反对阿尔及利亚人民。
