    Is the Food Industry a "Non-Essential" Industry?
    In the article "A Successful Attempt at Self-Production and Self-Marketing of Industrial Products" on page 2 of the People's Daily on December 27th of last year, it was stated that the food industry is an "industry with a wide variety of products that are not essential to people's lives," and elsewhere it was said that the products of the food industry are "consumer goods." This statement is inappropriate. Many products of the food industry are indispensable in people's daily lives. Some are also important industrial raw materials. To say that the products of the food industry are "non-essential to people's lives" or "consumer goods" is to take too narrow a view of the food industry.

    食品工业是“非生活必需品”行业吗
    去年12月27日人民日报第二版上“工业品自产自销的一个成功的尝试”文中，有一处说食品工业是一种“品种繁多而又非人民生活必需品的行业”，另一处又说食品工业的产品是“消费性商品”。这种说法是不恰当的。食品工业的产品有不少是人们日常生活中必不可少的。有一些也是重要的工业原料。说食品工业的产品是“非人民生活必需品”或“消费性商品”，那就把食品工业看得太狭窄了。
