Luoyang Enterprises' Employees Visit Rural Areas
Greatly Educated by Sharing Meals and Living with Farmers

(Our Dispatch) The Party organizations of various enterprises in Luoyang are adopting various measures to educate employees on the worker-peasant alliance and building the country through diligence and thrift.

The worker contingent gathered in Luoyang has, over the past two years, gradually built the ancient city of Luoyang into a new industrial city with their own hands. With the development of construction, a large number of new workers have been added to the worker ranks, including peasants, demobilized soldiers, students, freelancers, merchants, petty capitalists, landlords, and rich peasants. They have brought with them various non-proletarian ideologies and styles, hindering the development of the construction cause. Some people look down on labor, seek enjoyment, and compare themselves in terms of comfort, treatment, and extravagance; they make unreasonable demands regarding wages, benefits, work positions, and ranks. A few even become corrupt and degenerate, stealing, gambling, seriously undermining the moral character of the working class, and completely forgetting the virtues of hard work and simplicity, and the fine tradition of heroic struggle left to them by their predecessors.

In order to overcome these undesirable tendencies, in the past month, the Party organizations of various enterprises in Luoyang have strengthened education among employees regarding the relationship between the interests of the state and the individual, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and building the country through diligence and thrift. They have organized employees to visit rural areas in batches. Before the visits, each factory sent people to the countryside to make contacts and preparations. During the visits, they ate and lived with the peasants and held systematic life discussions, and visited the peasants' production. As a result, the employees felt that they had received a beneficial lesson in this visit.

After visiting the Ping Le Collective Farm in Mengjin County, the employees of the Tractor Factory's carpentry workshop realized that their living standards should not be separated from the broad masses of peasants, otherwise it would affect the unity of workers and peasants. Di Yongcheng, the head of the woodworking section of the woodworking mold department, who earns more than eighty yuan a month and supports a family of seven, still complained about hardship. This time he learned that although the lives of the peasant brothers have improved after liberation, especially after the collectivization, most people's incomes have increased, but they still live frugally. He was deeply moved and felt that he should not complain and should live more frugally. Wu Youyi realized that he shouldn't complain about the cold when he usually wore woolen sweaters and trousers to work in the workshop after seeing the peasant brothers engaged in winter plowing in the fields in sub-zero temperatures. The employees of the San Le Food Factory, who moved from Shanghai, used to eat and drink once every New Year's Day. But after visiting the lives of the peasant brothers, most of them opposed spending money indiscriminately during the New Year, saving the factory this expense. Some foreign employees once emphasized that life in Luoyang was difficult. After seeing the hardworking and frugal life of the peasant brothers, they also began to change.

Currently, in addition to continuing to organize employees to visit rural areas in batches, the Party organizations of various enterprises in Luoyang have also hired special personnel to tell employees about the glorious history of the Chinese Communist Party. At the same time, in the worker political training courses of many large factories, they have stipulated that studying the "Eighth National Congress" documents and implementing the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee as the main content for systematic political and ideological education.

    洛阳各企业职工访问农村
    和农民同吃同住受到了很大的教益
    本报讯　洛阳市各企业单位的党组织，采取各种措施向职工进行工农联盟、勤俭建国的教育。
    集结在洛阳的工人队伍，两年来用自己的双手，把洛阳古城逐渐地建成为一个新兴的工业城市。随着建设事业的发展，工人队伍里增加了大批新工人，其中有农民、转业军人、学生、自由职业者、商人、小资本家、地主、富农等。他们带来了各种非无产阶级思想意识和作风。障碍了建设事业的发展。有些人轻视劳动，贪图享受，比安逸、比待遇、比阔气；在工资、福利、工作地位、级别方面提出不合理的要求。个别的甚至腐化堕落，偷盗、赌博，严重地败坏了工人阶级的道德品质，完全忘记了先辈们遗留给他们的艰苦朴素的美德，英勇奋斗的优良传统。
    为了克服这些不良倾向，最近一个月来，洛阳市各企业单位党组织，在职工中加强关于国家和个人利益关系，巩固工农联盟，勤俭建国的教育。组织职工分批到农村进行访问，在访问之先，各厂都派人去农村联系，做好准备工作。访问中同农民一块儿吃、住，举行系统的生活座谈，参观农民的生产。因而，职工们在这次访问中，感到给自己上了有益的一课。
    拖拉机厂木工车间的职工在访问了孟津县平乐集体农庄回厂后，认识到自己的生活水平不应该脱离广大的农民群众，否则将要影响工农的团结。木模工部工段长狄永成，每月工资八十多元，养一家七口，还叫困难，这次了解到，农民兄弟们虽然解放后生活改善了，特别是在合作化以后，大多数人的收入都有增加，但是他们仍然省吃俭用地生活着，心里很受感动，觉得自己实在不该叫苦，要更加俭朴地过日子。吴有义看到农民兄弟在零下几度的严寒里在田野上进行冬耕，就觉悟到自己平常穿着毛衣毛裤在车间干活不应该嫌冷。上海迁来的三乐食品厂的职工，每年元旦照例要吃喝一次，但他们参观了农民兄弟的生活以后，大多数人提出了反对过年乱花钱的意见，给厂里节省了这笔开支。有一些外来职工曾经强调说洛阳生活艰苦，他们看到了农民兄弟克勤克俭生活情景，也开始转变了。
    目前，洛阳市各企业单位的党组织，除了继续组织职工分批访问农村外，还分别聘请专人向职工们讲中国共产党的光辉的历史，同时在许多大厂的工人政治训练课目中，规定了以学习“八大”文件和贯彻八届二中全会决议精神为主要内容，进行系统的政治思想教育。
