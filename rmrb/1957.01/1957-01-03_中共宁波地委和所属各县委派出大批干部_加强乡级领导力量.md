The CCP Ningbo Prefectural Committee and its subordinate county committees are gradually taking measures to strengthen leadership at the township level.

According to Zhejiang Daily: After the Ningbo region abolished districts and merged townships, the number of cadres working in rural areas was weakened due to the transfer of a large number of rural cadres. Taking Yin County as an example, when districts were abolished and townships merged, 112 district cadres were transferred to county-level organs, but the leadership at the township level was not strengthened as it should have been. Therefore, under the current tense and heavy rural work tasks, although the cadres of many townships are busy and "sweating profusely," the implementation of work tasks is still not timely and effective enough; the county's leading organs also feel that the command is ineffective and the leadership is strenuous.

In order to change this situation of being "top-heavy and bottom-light," the Prefectural Committee and the county committees are gradually taking measures to strengthen the leadership at the township level. First, the Prefectural Committee and the county committees conducted a thorough survey of the weak leadership situation at the township level after the abolition of districts and the merger of townships. Based on the results of the investigation and research, all fourteen counties in the region transferred 109 cadres from county-level organs who were familiar with rural work and had a certain level of leadership, equivalent to the level of district committee, to serve as general branch secretaries in townships, strengthening the leadership of 108 townships. In mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation and truly difficult leadership, such as Fenghua, Xinchang, and Shengxian counties, the county committees have also transferred a group of cadres equivalent to the level of county and district committees from county-level organs to form district committees respectively, serving as their representative organs to help the grassroots party organizations implement the resolutions and instructions of higher party committees and cultivate the ability of grassroots party organizations to work independently.

At the same time, the Prefectural Committee and the county committees have also transferred a large number of organ cadres to the countryside to help grassroots cadres work. The responsible comrades of the Prefectural Committee and the county committees also often go deep into townships and cooperatives to help grassroots cadres solve problems and improve the leadership level of township cadres. It is understood that some time ago, there were 657 organ cadres in Shaoxing, Yuyao, and other eight counties who were helping with work in the countryside. Recently, another 130 county party secretaries and county party committee members throughout the region have gone deep into advanced production units to help grassroots cadres summarize and promote advanced experiences. These cadres sent down to help with work not only helped townships and cooperatives solve some specific problems, but also greatly encouraged the work confidence of grassroots cadres and promoted the current movement to increase production and practice economy.

In order to continuously improve the policy and professional level and working ability of township cadres, Yin County, Shangyu, and other counties are also preparing to hold short-term training classes to train township cadres who are not trained by the Prefectural Committee in rotation. For township cadres who currently have a very low level of education, the Shangyu County Committee is also preparing to run cultural remedial classes to improve their cultural level.

### 中共宁波地委和所属各县委派出大批干部  加强乡级领导力量

    中共宁波地委和所属各县委派出大批干部
    加强乡级领导力量
    本报讯　据浙江日报消息：中共宁波地委和所属县委逐步采取措施，加强乡一级的领导力量。
    宁波地区在撤区并乡后，由于大批农村干部上调，农村工作干部力量有所削弱。以鄞县为例，在撤区并乡时，把一百十二名区干部调到县级机关里，而乡一级领导力量，却没有得到应有的加强。因此，在当前农村工作任务紧张、繁重的情况下，虽然许多乡的干部忙得“满头大汗”，而工作任务的贯彻还是不够及时、有力；县的领导机关也感到指挥不灵、领导吃力。
    为了改变这种“头重脚轻”的状况，地委和各县委正在逐步采取措施，加强乡一级的领导力量。首先，地委和各县委对撤区并乡后出现的乡一级领导力量薄弱的情况进行了摸底排队，并根据调查研究的结果，全区十四个县从县级机关抽调了一百零九名熟悉农村工作情况、有一定领导水平、相当于区委一级的干部到乡担任总支书记，加强了一百零八个乡的领导力量。在交通不便、领导确实困难的山区，如奉化、新昌、嵊县等县，县委又从县级机关抽调一批相当于县委、区委级的干部，分别组成区委会，作为自己的代表机关，来帮助党的基层组织贯彻实现上级党委的决议、指示，培养党的基层组织独立工作的能力。
    与此同时，地委和各县委还抽调了大批机关干部下乡帮助基层干部工作，地委和各县委的负责同志，也经常深入到乡、社，帮助基层干部解决问题，提高乡干部的领导水平。据了解，前些日子绍兴、余姚等八县在农村帮助工作的机关干部就有六百五十七名。最近全区又有一百三十名县委书记和县委委员深入到先进生产单位，帮助基层干部总结和推广先进经验。这些派下去帮助工作的干部，不仅帮助乡、社解决了一些具体问题，而且也大大鼓舞了基层干部的工作信心，推动了当前的增产节约运动。
    为了不断提高乡干部的政策业务水平和工作能力，鄞县、上虞等县还准备举办短期训练班，轮流调训不属地委训练的乡干部。对目前文化水平很低的乡干部，上虞县委还准备举办文化补习班，来提高他们的文化水平。
