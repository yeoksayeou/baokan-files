Xinhua News Agency, January 29th—The Beijing Public Health Bureau held its year-end award ceremony for 1956 on the 28th. At the meeting, 65 units including medical, health and epidemic prevention, and healthcare institutions, and 1,222 outstanding medical personnel were rewarded.

In the past year, Beijing's medical and health workers have created many outstanding achievements and advanced experiences in implementing the spirit of "prevention first, serving production," implementing traditional Chinese medicine policies, implementing the graded and specialized medical system, and improving the quality of medical care.

The Fuchengmen Joint Clinic, which received a unit award, conducts home visits for acute infectious disease patients within its designated area and actively provides outpatient treatment. In the past year, no measles or dysentery patients in this area died. The painless childbirth method promotion rate at the Beijing No. 4 Maternity Hospital is around 90%, with a success rate of over 93%. This hospital also sets up special clinic days for factory workers in the eastern suburbs on their days off, making it convenient for workers to seek medical treatment. The Siwangfu Maternal and Child Health Station in the suburbs helped rural midwives improve their delivery techniques. In the two townships they are responsible for, there have been no deaths due to newborn tetanus or puerperal fever in the past three years. The eight hospitals that received awards have played an active role in implementing the graded and specialized medical system. Beijing Sixth and Seventh Hospitals have organized various studies for medical personnel in factories and grassroots medical institutions and helped them solve difficult problems.

Huang Yongren, director of medical affairs at the Beijing Stomatological Hospital, who won the special prize, researched and successfully used domestically produced sodium alginate as an elastic impression material for dentures through clinical application. This impression material provides accurate impressions and is easy to operate. Traditional Chinese medicine doctor Zhao Bingnan has rich clinical experience in treating skin diseases. He painstakingly studies traditional Chinese medicine and improves medical efficiency. Wu Guizhi, a pharmacist at the Beijing Ping'an Hospital, actively researches traditional Chinese medicine and improved the dosage form of the traditional Chinese medicine Liushen Pills, saving valuable medicinal materials and reducing costs. Many nurses who have made achievements in nursing work have also been rewarded.
