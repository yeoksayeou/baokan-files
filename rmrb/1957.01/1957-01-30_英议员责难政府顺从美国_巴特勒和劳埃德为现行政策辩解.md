Xinhua News Agency, January 29th, London: British MPs held a debate on foreign policy in the House of Commons on the 28th. Labor MP Stephen Davies raised the following question to the Prime Minister: "In view of President Eisenhower's declared policy regarding U.S. military intervention in the Middle East and the possibility of thus provoking a Third World War, will he immediately have all U.S. armed forces personnel withdrawn from British territory, in order to reduce the risk of involving Britain in this war?"

Davies explained his meaning, asking, "Does the Prime Minister regard U.S. intervention in the Middle East as a great danger threatening world peace, and is it not now time for the government to decide to abolish the main bases of U.S. armed forces on British territory?"

Home Secretary Butler, speaking on behalf of the Prime Minister, gave a negative reply to the above question. Butler simultaneously attempted to defend U.S. policy by using the non-existent danger of "international communism" as an excuse. Butler affirmed that "U.S. armed forces stationed in the United Kingdom are one of the factors preventing war."

Subsequently, Labor MP E. Fletcher asked Butler if he agreed that: "The American bases established in Britain expose us to more danger; is it wise if we ask the U.S. to provide us with more assistance and intelligence regarding defense and atomic weapons than they currently do?"

Butler replied: "I have no doubt that Defense Minister Sandys' visit to the United States will be very beneficial in this and many other respects."

Conservative MP Pilkington mentioned the abusive remarks about French and British soldiers made by Dulles last Friday while testifying in the Senate, and asked: "If Mr. Dulles were not next to us, should we not feel much safer in this country?" At this point, cries of "Hear, hear!" and laughter of approval resounded in the hall.

A question raised by Labor MP Swingler sparked a heated debate, as he questioned the Foreign Secretary as to whether the government intended to publish a white paper discussing what measures the government had taken in the past two years to promote the relaxation of restrictions on Western trade with the People's Republic of China.

Some Labor MPs on this point drew attention to the fact that Britain's refusal to expand trade with China had caused Britain huge losses, while some of Britain's trade competitors were conducting frequent trade with China.

Labor MP Bevan raised a question as to whether the government still wanted to rely on its allies in this regard, mainly relying on an ally "that is no longer worthy of being called an ally." (Clearly referring to the United States)

Foreign Secretary Lloyd said that the British government had reconsidered the so-called "strategic materials" list, and as a result, the list had been reduced. Lloyd said, however, that the UK, in deciding this issue, could not but take into account the views of its allies, because what was involved here was less a trade issue than a political one.

Speaking of the Middle East issue, Lloyd said that the British government still advocates the occupation of the Gaza Strip by United Nations forces.

    英议员责难政府顺从美国
    巴特勒和劳埃德为现行政策辩解
    新华社29日讯　伦敦消息：英下院28日就外交政策问题展开辩论。工党议员斯蒂芬·戴维斯向首相提出下列问题：“他是否考虑到艾森豪威尔总统宣布的关于美国对中东的军事干涉和可能因此挑起第三次世界大战的政策，而立即让美国武装部队的全部人员撤离英国领土，以减少把英国卷入这个战争的危险？”
    戴维斯解释了自己的意思，他问：“首相是否把美国对中东的干涉看作是威胁世界和平的极大危险，难道现在不是政府应该决定取消美国武装部队在英国领土上的主要基地的时候了吗？”
    内政大臣巴特勒代表首相发言，对上述问题给予否定的答复。巴特勒同时企图以并不存在的“国际共产主义”危险为借口，替美国政策辩护。巴特勒肯定说，“美国驻扎在联合王国的武装部队是制止战争的因素之一”。
    接着，工党议员埃·弗莱彻问巴特勒，他是不是同意：“设立在英国的美国基地使我们受到更多的危险；如果我们要求美国供给我们比现在更多的援助和有关国防和原子武器的情报，这是否明智？”
    巴特勒答道：“我不怀疑，国防大臣桑迪斯的访问美国在这方面和其他许多方面都是非常有好处的。”
    保守党议员皮尔金顿提到杜勒斯上星期五在参议院作证时所说的辱骂法国兵和英国兵的话，并且问道：“如果杜勒斯先生不在我们的旁边，我们不应当感到这个国家更安全得多吗？”这时会场上响起了“听着，听着！”的喊声和笑声表示欢迎。
    工党议员斯文勒提出的问题引起了热烈的辩论，他质问外交大臣，政府是否想发表白皮书，谈谈政府在近两年来采取了哪些措施来促使放宽西方同中华人民共和国之间的贸易上的限制。
    一些工党议员就这点提醒注意下面这一事实：英国拒绝同中国扩大贸易，使英国遭到了巨大的损失，而英国的一些贸易竞争对手却同中国进行着频繁的贸易。
    工党议员比万提出一个问题，政府在这方面是不是仍想依靠自己的盟国，主要是依靠一个“已经不配叫做盟国”的盟国。（显然是指美国）
    外交大臣劳埃德说，英国政府已经重新考虑了所谓“战略物资”货单，结果这个货目单被缩小了。劳埃德说，但是，英国在决定这个问题的时候，不能不考虑自己盟国的意见，因为这里所涉及的与其说是贸易问题，不如说是政治问题。
    劳埃德在谈到中东问题时说，英国政府仍旧主张由联合国部队占领加沙地带。
