Premier Zhou's Speech at Kabul Airport

Your Royal Highness Prime Minister Daud Khan, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:

I am about to leave your capital. First of all, I would like to thank the Government and people of the Kingdom of Afghanistan for their warm hospitality, and thank Your Royal Highness Prime Minister for your personal care and meticulous arrangements, which have enabled us to have the opportunity to learn about many aspects of the life of our friendly neighbor, Afghanistan, in the past four days. We deeply feel that this visit has been fruitful, and the happy times spent here will forever remain in our most precious memories.

We have seen the past of Afghanistan. The excellent culture you have created in your long history and your indomitable spirit in striving for independence have left us with extremely deep impressions.

We have also seen the present of Afghanistan. Your people are working hard for the construction of your own country. We sincerely wish you success.

We have also seen that the friendly relations between the Chinese and Afghan people, which were established in ancient times, have been restored, and they have great potential for extensive development.

We have always believed that direct contact between leaders of various countries is conducive to promoting understanding and friendship between countries, thereby also contributing to promoting international peace and cooperation. This visit has once again confirmed our belief. Through the talks between the two sides, we have written our desire to further develop economic and cultural ties between our two countries, and to further strengthen cooperation in the cause of peace, into our joint communiqué. I believe that these wishes will all become reality. On our part, the Chinese government and people will strive to make their due contributions.

We are very pleased that Your Royal Highness Prime Minister Daud Khan has accepted the invitation of the Chinese government. I hope that in the near future, we will be able to reunite with our distinguished guests as old friends on our own land.

Once again, I congratulate the Kingdom of Afghanistan on its national prosperity and the happiness of its people, and congratulate the growing friendship between China and Afghanistan, and congratulate the continuous consolidation of peace in Asia and the world, which we all care about.

    周总理在喀布尔机场的讲话尊敬的达乌德汗首相殿下，诸位阁下，诸位先生：
    我就要离开你们的首都了。首先我要感谢阿富汗王国政府和人民的盛意，感谢首相殿下您本人的亲切关怀和细心安排，使我们能够有机会在过去的四天中认识了我们友好的邻邦——阿富汗的生活的许多方面。我们深深感到这次访问的收获是丰富的，在这里度过的愉快的时光将永远留在我们最珍贵的记忆中。
    我们看到了阿富汗的过去。你们在悠久的历史中所创造的优秀文化同你们争取独立的不屈不挠的精神给我们留下了极其深刻的印象。
    我们也看到了阿富汗的现在。你们的人民正在为你们自己的国家建设而努力。我们衷心地祝你们成功。
    我们还看到，在遥远的古代就建立了起来的中国人民和阿富汗人民之间的友好关系，已经得到了恢复，而且，它有着广泛发展的极大可能。
    我们一向相信，各国领导人之间的直接接触是有助于促进各国之间的了解和友谊，从而也有助于促进国际和平和合作的。这次访问又一次证实了我们的信念。经过双方的会谈，我们已经把我们两国进一步发展经济和文化联系的愿望，进一步加强在和平事业中的合作的愿望写在我们的联合公报中。我相信，这些愿望都将成为事实。在我们这一方面，中国政府和人民将努力作出自己应尽的贡献。
    我们十分高兴，达乌德汗首相殿下已经接受了中国政府的邀请。我希望，不久以后，我们就能在自己的土地上同我们尊贵的客人作为老朋友而再次欢聚。
    我再一次祝贺阿富汗王国国家繁荣，人民幸福，祝贺中阿两国的友谊日益发展，祝贺我们所共同关心的亚洲和世界的和平不断巩固。
