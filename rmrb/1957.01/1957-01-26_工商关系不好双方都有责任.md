    Poor Labor-Management Relations: Both Sides Are Responsible
    A letter from the Jinan City Company of the China Textile Products Company in Shandong Province: After reading the article "Only Consider Yourself, Not Others" published in the People's Daily on December 18, 1956, which criticized our company for pursuing excessive commercial profits and neglecting industrial production, we immediately conducted an examination of the current problems between labor and management. We believe that there are indeed some problems in both business handling and work style between labor and management, and the reasons for these problems are complex. We believe that the failure to resolve some of the problems between our company and the weaving and dyeing factories under the Jinan Weaving and Dyeing Bureau is the responsibility of both labor and management.

专栏：对批评的反应

    工商关系不好双方都有责任
    中国纺织品公司山东省济南市公司来信：1956年12月18日人民日报发表“只顾自己不顾别人”一文，批评我公司为了追求过高的商业利润，不照顾工业生产。我们当即对现时工商关系之间的问题进行了检查，我们认为，在工商之间无论在业务处理上，工作作风上是存在着一些问题的，产生这些问题的原因又是复杂的。我们认为，我公司同济南织染局所属织染厂加工工作存在的一些问题，所以未能解决，工商双方都要负一定的责任。
