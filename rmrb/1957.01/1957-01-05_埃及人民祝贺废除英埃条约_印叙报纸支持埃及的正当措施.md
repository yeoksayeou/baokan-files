    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 4th: According to Cairo newspapers on the 3rd, thousands of representatives from all walks of life in Egypt went to the Presidential Palace on the 2nd to congratulate President Nasser on the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty signed in 1954. Among these visitors were officers, police officers, civil servants, doctors, engineers, lawyers, students, and workers.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 4th: Damascus News: Syrian newspapers welcomed Egypt's announcement of the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.
    "Al-Sham" published news on January 2nd about the abolition of the treaty, with the headline "Egypt Slaps Britain Again."
    "Al-Youm" said: "Nasser has given Britain a decisive blow." It said that the abolition of the 1954 treaty was a natural result of the British aggression against Egypt.
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 4th: "The Times of India" published an editorial today supporting Egypt's announcement of the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. The editorial said: "Nasser is completely justified in believing that the treaty signed in 1954 became invalid on the day the British and French launched their attack." It said: "Neither legal nor moral reasons can say that a country that has suffered aggression should continue to consider its relationship with the aggressor as normal and unchanged."
    "Hindustan Times" said today that anyone with a sense of justice would not criticize Nasser's measure. The newspaper called on the British government to fully recognize that "it is impossible to return to Egypt in the current situation."
    "Hindustan Standard" said in today's editorial that Egypt's abolition of the treaty "is an inevitable result of the military adventure carried out by Britain and France last October." The editorial pointed out: "In fact, when Egypt was suddenly attacked with artillery and bombers, Britain itself (in collusion with France) had already abolished the treaty."

    埃及人民祝贺废除英埃条约
    印叙报纸支持埃及的正当措施
    据新华社开罗4日电　据开罗报纸3日报道，数以千计埃及各阶层人民的代表2日前往总统府，向纳赛尔总统祝贺废除1954年签订的英埃条约。在这些访问者中间，有军官、警官、公务人员、医师、工程师、律师、学生和工人等。
    新华社4日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚报纸对埃及宣布废除英埃条约表示欢迎。
    “沙姆报”在1月2日登载了关于废除这项条约的新闻，标题是“埃及又打了英国一个耳光”。
    “今天报”说：“纳赛尔已经给了英国一个决定性的打击”。它说，废除1954年的条约是英国侵略埃及的自然的结果。
    据新华社新德里4日电　“印度时报”今天发表社论，支持埃及宣布废除英埃条约。社论说：“纳赛尔认为1954年签订的条约在英法发动进攻的那一天就已经失效，这是完全正当的。”它说：“不论是根据法律或是道义的理由，都不能够说，身受侵略之害的国家应当继续认为它同侵略者的关系是正常和不变的。”
    “印度斯坦时报”今天说，凡是有正义感的人都不会批评纳赛尔的这个措施。这家报纸要求英国政府充分认识，“在目前情况下，要重新回到埃及是不可能的”。
    “印度斯坦旗报”今天的社论说，埃及废除这项条约，“是英法两国在去年10月间进行军事冒险所引起的必然结果”。社论指出：“事实上，当突然用大炮和轰炸机袭击埃及的时候，英国自己就已经（在法国的伙同下）废除了这项条约。”
