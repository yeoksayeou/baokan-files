The average income per household exceeds 800 yuan

Haizhong Township in Nanhai County, Guangdong Province, used to be a poor rural area. Before liberation, the entire township had only one water buffalo. Now, on the surface, it doesn't seem particularly wealthy—茅草 houses are more common than brick houses. However, don't underestimate it. It's the first township in Nanhai County to achieve a yield of 1,000 catties of rice per mu, and it's also home to the "1,000-catty yield" cooperative—the Red Flag Agricultural Cooperative. This cooperative achieved overall increased production in 1956, with every household increasing its income. The cooperative's production and members' incomes have already surpassed the level of local middle peasants. The 286 cooperative members averaged 864 yuan per household (including income from household sideline occupations). Now, almost every family raises one or two fat pigs and flocks of chickens and ducks. No one is wavering about withdrawing from the cooperative, and no one is abandoning agriculture for commerce. The entire township is filled with an atmosphere of diligent production and a resolute commitment to the socialist path.

Not Always Smooth Sailing

After this cooperative was upgraded from a primary cooperative to an advanced cooperative in the autumn of 1955, although it was hit by eight saltwater tides and a serious insect infestation, the average annual rice yield per mu still reached 800 catties, and it was selected as a model cooperative in the county. The members, in order to run the cooperative well, can be said to have spared no effort. However, despite this, the income of the members did not increase significantly. At that time, poor peasants borrowed money, middle peasants complained, and individual households requested to withdraw from the cooperative, and more than a dozen members were affected. During these difficult days, the cooperative director, Yang Yi, shed tears of anxiety. A mountain of problems weighed him down: Why did the income of the members not increase significantly? Why were poor peasants crying poverty and middle peasants complaining about reduced income? Why were some members threatening to withdraw from the cooperative? A person with a sense of responsibility for the socialist cause would not be pessimistic and disappointed because of this, nor would they doubt the superiority of the cooperative and be at a loss. They were determined to find out the reason.

The Need to Develop Production Comprehensively

One thing enlightened them: The poorest member, Liang Enzai, had been borrowing money from the cooperative to make a living since joining. However, during the spring famine of 1956, when poor peasant members were borrowing money from the cooperative every day, he did not borrow money from the cooperative, and his life was manageable. What was the reason for this? It turned out that after the summer distribution in 1955, he expanded from raising a few ducks to raising a fat pig, solving the family's problem of surviving the famine. This led them to study the past production and income of several upper-middle peasant members such as Liang Guo and Liang Rong. They found that these members had engaged in various economic activities such as agriculture and sideline occupations in the past, and therefore had higher incomes and better lives. However, the cooperative only focused on developing rice production and neglected the development of cash crops and household sideline occupations, which prevented the cooperative's production level from increasing rapidly, and the income of the middle peasants did not reach the previous level. From this, they concluded that the fundamental problem was the failure to develop production comprehensively.

However, how should production be developed comprehensively in actual work? The Party branch and the cooperative's management committee studied the Party's instructions and held separate forums with members who had experience in planting various cash crops. After discussion, they made a plan to make full use of the cooperative's favorable conditions to comprehensively develop production. In this plan, they proposed that while focusing on developing grain production, animal husbandry, cash crops, and sideline occupations should be developed correctly, according to local conditions, and in proportion, and that the four should be combined and support each other. Facts have proved that this approach is correct. The income from raising pigs, chickens, ducks, and geese in this cooperative in one year accounted for 12.76% of the total income; the planting area of cash crops accounted for only 8% of the cooperative's cultivated land area, but the income accounted for 24.46% of the total agricultural income. Because sideline production and cash crops generated a total income of more than 111,000 yuan, not only was the value of each workday increased, but the cooperative had income every day and could distribute it once a month.

Reasonable Arrangements for Members' Household Sideline Occupations

While comprehensively developing production, if we only pay attention to developing the cooperative's public economy and do not pay attention to helping members develop household sideline occupations, the cooperative's income will be borrowed and spent by the members, and there will be no way to revitalize the cooperative's production funds and increase public accumulation. However, how should the relationship between the cooperative's public economy and the members' household sideline occupations be handled correctly? As early as the spring of 1955, some agricultural cooperatives had blindly called for the development of members' household sideline occupations. Some middle peasants raised many pigs, chickens, and ducks at once, focusing only on household sideline occupations and not working for the cooperative; poor peasants, on the other hand, were unable to do so even if they had the will, and could not even raise a duckling. This made the cadres realize that it is necessary to unify leadership, unify planning, and develop household sideline occupations according to certain principles. They convened meetings of middle peasant members to study methods for how many sideline occupations a family could engage in without hindering the cooperative's collective production; they convened meetings of poor peasant members to understand their difficulties and help and encourage them to develop household sideline occupations. At the same time, several cooperative cadres also went door-to-door to find out the economic capabilities of the members so that the cooperative could provide assistance to the members in terms of funds, seedlings, and so on. In this way, the members' household sideline occupations were developed in a unified and appropriately proportional manner under the unified planning and leadership of the cooperative; the development of household sideline occupations of poor and middle peasant members reached a balance, and there was no phenomenon of members developing too many household sideline occupations, focusing only on household sideline occupations and being unwilling to work for the cooperative.

Developing the Public Economy

In order for the agricultural cooperative to be able to unify the leadership of the members' household sideline production and develop it in an appropriate proportion, it depends on whether the agricultural cooperative's public economy is strong. The results of the year-end distribution in 1956 show that the remuneration for each workday reached 1.44 yuan, which is a basic guarantee for increasing the income of the members. Of the members' total income, 79.7% came from the cooperative, and only 20.3% came from household sideline occupations. The development of the public economy, in addition to increasing the value of workdays, also continuously increased the cooperative's public property. Now, the cooperative's public property averages 113.7 yuan per member household. Public accumulation funds and public welfare funds accounted for only 3% of the total income in 1954, but increased to 10% in 1956. This ensures that the cooperative has a strong force to expand agricultural and sideline production year by year. The public economic strength of the cooperative is strong, and the value of the workday is high, which attracts the members to firmly take the socialist road like a magnet attracting iron. Many members realize that if the public economic strength were not strong, household sideline occupations could not have developed so universally and vigorously. Now, on average, each member household raises one and a half pigs, thirty chickens, and twenty-four ducks. The members know that this is not only their own ability, but also the result of public economic support. Precisely because of this, although the Red Flag Cooperative is only a short distance from Guangzhou, no member has abandoned agriculture for business; also precisely because of this, the members feel that the income from working for themselves for a day is not as much as the income from working for the cooperative for a day, so often 90% of the members actively work for the cooperative and are unwilling to delay the cooperative's work for family production.

Running the Cooperative Diligently and Frugally to Reduce Production Costs

The Red Flag Cooperative's strong public economic strength has been gradually accumulated through hard work. The cooperative's cadres have spent a lot of effort to summarize experiences and lessons in order to find ways for the long-term development of the public economy. In the past, the reason for the Red Flag Cooperative's weak public economy, in addition to the single production, was mainly unplanned expenditures, unreasonable investments, and high production costs. They absorbed these lessons and seized the key link of running the cooperative diligently and frugally and reducing production costs as the main link in developing and consolidating the public economy. In agriculture, they tapped labor potential, improved labor productivity, adhered to regular manure accumulation movements, used labor to obtain local miscellaneous fertilizers to replace commercial fertilizers, and strived for fertilizer self-sufficiency; in animal husbandry, they improved animal husbandry technology, relied on their own breeding of seedlings, used fermented feed, and reduced pig raising costs; in terms of expenditures, all expenditures were based on the principle of meeting the needs of production, and non-productive expenditures were reduced. They also often paid attention to fighting against thoughts that violated the principle of running the cooperative diligently and frugally. For example, in August 1956, each team planned to build brick and tile cowsheds, but the management committee persuaded them to use thatched roofs instead, and bought four calves with the money saved. Now, these four calves have grown up and can plow the fields. From this concrete fact, the members further understood the principle of running the cooperative diligently and frugally. At present, diligence and frugality have become the fashion in this cooperative. There are many new people and new things in the Red Flag Cooperative where husbands encourage wives to be diligent, wives encourage husbands to be thrifty, and money is invested in production.

In this way, the Red Flag Cooperative has achieved comprehensive increases in agricultural and sideline production, increased the income of every member household, and continuously strengthened the collective economy of the agricultural cooperative. What is even more gratifying is that they have provided the state with 693 catties of marketable grain per mu, and each member household has provided a large amount of non-staple food to urban and rural people. If the red flag represents advancement, then the red flag of advanced production belonging to the Red Flag Agricultural Production Cooperative is well-deserved.

    红旗应归红旗社
    黄予里　汪学勤
    每户平均收入八百多元
    广东南海县海中乡，过去是一个贫穷的农村。在解放前，全乡只有一头水牛；现在，从表面上看来，也不见得怎样富庶——一眼望过去，茅房比砖屋还多。可是，你别小看它，它是南海县的第一个稻田千斤丰产乡，也是千斤丰产社——红旗农业社的所在地。这个社在1956年全面增产，户户增加了收入，全社的生产和社员的收入已经超过了当地中农的水平，二百八十六户社员平均每户收入八百六十四元（包括家庭副业收入），现在几乎家家都养着一两只肥猪和一群群的鸡鸭。这里，没有人动摇退社，也没有人弃农就商，全乡充满着勤俭生产、坚决走社会主义道路的气氛。
    并非一帆风顺
    这个社在1955年秋天由初级社合并升级转变为高级社以后，虽然连续遭到八次咸潮和严重虫害的袭击，但稻谷的每亩平均年产量仍然达到了八百斤，并被评选为全县的模范社。社员们为了办好社，可以说是不辞艰辛的了。然而，尽管这样，却没有显著地增加社员的收入。那时候，贫农借钱，中农抱怨，个别户要求退社，一下子就有十多户社员跟着波动起来。在这些困难的日子里，社主任杨溢焦虑到淌泪，一大堆问题压得他连气也透不过来：为什么社员收入增加不显著？为什么贫农喊穷、中农喊收入减少？为什么有的社员闹退社？一个对社会主义事业有责任感的人是不会因此而悲观失望，也不会因此而怀疑合作社的优越性而无所适从的。他们坚定地要寻求出一个所以然的道理来。
    要全面发展生产
    有一件事情启发了他们：最贫困的社员梁奀仔，入社以来都是在社里借钱度日。可是，在1956年春荒时期，天天有贫农社员向社借钱，他没有向社借钱，生活反而能过得去。这是什么原因呢？原来他在1955年夏季分配后，由养几只鸭扩大到养一只肥猪，解决了一家的度荒问题。这件事情引导他们研究了梁国、梁容等几户上中农社员过去的生产和收入的情况。他们发觉这几户社员过去都经营着农业、副业等多种经济，因此收入较多，生活较好。而合作社只注意发展稻谷生产，忽视了发展经济作物和家庭副业生产，这就使社的生产水平不能迅速提高，中农的收入也就达不到过去的水平了。他们由此得出了结论：根本的问题在于没有全面发展生产。
    然而，在实际工作中究竟怎样全面发展生产呢？党的支部和社的管理委员会研究了党的指示，并分别召开了有种植各种经济作物经验的社员的座谈会。经过讨论，作出了充分利用社里的有利条件来全面发展生产的计划。他们在这个计划中提出：在以发展粮食生产为主的同时，正确地、因地制宜地、按比例地发展畜牧业、经济作物和副业生产，并且要做到四者相互结合、相互支援。事实证明这个作法是正确的。这个社养猪、鸡、鸭、鹅一年的收入，就占总收入的12.76％；经济作物的种植面积只占社里耕地面积的8％，但收入却占农业总收入的24.46％。由于副业生产和经济作物共收入了十一万一千多元，不仅提高了每个劳动日的价值，而且社里每天都有收入，每月都可以分配一次。
    合理安排社员家庭副业
    在全面发展生产的同时，如果只注意发展社的公共经济，而不注意帮助社员发展家庭副业生产，社的收入被社员借光、支光，活跃社的生产资金和增加公共积累也就无从谈起。但是，怎样正确处理社的公共经济和社员家庭副业的关系呢？远在1955年春季，有些农业社就因为一味号召发展社员的家庭副业，一些中农一下子养了许多猪、鸡、鸭，只顾埋头搞家庭副业而不为社出勤；贫农则因为心有余而力不足，连一只鸭仔也养不上。这就使干部意识到一定要统一领导、统一规划和根据一定的原则去发展家庭副业。他们召集中农社员开会，研究了一个家庭搞多少副业才不致妨碍社的集体生产的办法；召集贫农社员开会，了解了他们的困难，帮助和鼓励他们发展家庭副业。同时，几个社干部还分别深入到户，摸清社员的经济能力，以便社在资金、种苗等方面帮助社员的时候有分寸。这样，就使社员的家庭副业在社的统一规划、统一领导之下，按着恰当的比例发展；使贫、中农社员的家庭副业发展达到平衡，而没有出现过社员发展家庭副业过大过多、只知埋头搞家庭副业而不愿为社出勤的现象。
    发展公共经济
    要使农业社能够统一领导社员的家庭副业生产，并按恰当的比例发展，取决于农业社的公共经济是否雄厚。1956年年终分配的结果表明，每个劳动日的报酬达到一元四角四分，这是增加社员收入的基本保证。在社员的全部收入中，从社里得到的占79.7％，从家庭副业中得到的只占20.3％。公共经济的发展，除提高了劳动日价值外，还使社的公共财产不断地增加。现在，社的公共财产，平均每户社员有一百一十三元七角，公积金、公益金在1954年才占总收入的3％，到1956年就增加到10％。这就保证了社有雄厚的力量来逐年扩大农副业生产。社里的公共经济力量雄厚，劳动日价值又高，也就像磁石吸铁一样地吸引着社员坚定地走社会主义的道路。很多社员都认识到：如果不是公共经济力量雄厚，家庭副业就不可能这么普遍旺盛地发展。现在，平均每户社员自养一头半猪、三十只鸡、二十四只鸭。社员们知道这并不只是自己的本事，而是公共经济支持的结果。正因为如此，红旗社虽然和广州相隔咫尺，却没有一个社员弃农经商；也正因为如此，社员感到给自己劳动一天的收入，不如出勤一天的收入多，所以经常有90％的社员积极为社出勤，而不愿为家庭生产误社里的工。
    勤俭办社降低生产成本
    红旗社的雄厚的公共经济力量，是付出艰辛的劳动逐步积累起来的。社里的干部为了寻求公共经济长足发展的途径，曾经费了不少脑筋去总结经验教训。过去，红旗社公共经济单薄的原因，除了生产单一化之外，主要是开支无计划，投资不合理，生产成本高。他们吸取这些教训，抓住了勤俭办社、降低生产成本，作为开展和巩固公共经济的主要环节。在农业方面发掘劳动潜力，提高劳动生产效率，坚持经常性的积肥运动，以劳力取得土杂肥料以代替商品肥料，争取肥料自给；在畜牧业方面，改进畜牧技术，靠自己繁殖种苗，使用发酵饲料，降低养猪成本；在开支方面，一切开支以服从生产的需要为原则，减少非生产性的开支。他们还经常注意对违反勤俭办社方针的思想作斗争。如1956年8月，各队都计划建砖瓦牛栏，管委会说服他们改用茅草搭，把节省下来的钱买了四头小牛。现在，这四头小牛已长大会犁田了。社员们从这一具体事实中，更进一步懂得了勤俭办社的道理。目前，勤俭已成为这个社的风尚，夫劝妻勤、妻劝夫俭、把钱投入生产的新人新事，在红旗社是很多的。
    就是这样，红旗社取得了农副业的全面增产，使社员户户增加了收入，农业社的公有经济不断壮大。更可喜的是：他们每亩地为国家提供了六百九十三斤商品粮，每户社员都为城乡人民提供了大量副食品。如果说红旗是代表先进的，那么，生产先进的红旗归于红旗农业生产合作社，是应当之而无愧的。
