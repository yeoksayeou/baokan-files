Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 24th - Workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Company are extensively carrying out the work of collecting scrap steel. This year, Anshan Iron and Steel Company plans to collect 300,000 tons of scrap steel to solve the problem of insufficient steel raw materials.

　　In recent days, relevant units have dispatched several power shovels to the large steel slag heaps to excavate the steel slag accumulated over the years. At the same time, various factories and mines have also put forward guarantees to collect all the scrap steel scattered everywhere, so that no usable scrap steel is mixed in the garbage. The transportation department and the motor vehicle team also allocate five or six train cars and twenty cars every day to transport the collected scrap steel.

　　Anshan Iron and Steel workers are very enthusiastic about collecting scrap steel. Last year alone, they collected 168,000 tons of scrap steel. Now, whenever workers get off work, they go out in groups to search for scrap steel. Li Chunqiao, the 71-year-old night watchman at the waste product recycling station, also excavates usable scrap metal materials every day. He also motivated the other three workers in the waste product recycling station to work together. Last year, the four of them recycled 63 tons of scrap steel.

    鞍钢职工积极搜集废钢铁
    新华社鞍山24日电　鞍山钢铁公司职工正在广泛开展搜集废钢铁的工作。今年鞍钢公司准备搜集三十万吨废钢铁，来解决钢铁原料不足的问题。
    连日来，有关单位已经派出了好几台电铲到大片的钢渣堆旁，挖掘历年积存下来的钢渣。和这同时，各厂矿还提出保证要把散存在各处的废钢铁搜集干净，不让一些可用的废钢铁混杂在垃圾里面。运输部和汽车大队也每日拨出五、六节火车皮和二十辆汽车，专门运输搜集起来的废钢铁。
    鞍钢职工搜集废钢铁的热情很高。去年一年里，他们搜集了十六万八千吨废钢铁。现在每当工人下班以后，就成群结队地在寻拣废钢铁。废品再生站七十一岁的打更老人李春桥，也天天在挖掘可用的废钢材料，他还带动了废品再生站的另外三个工人一起动手，去年他们四个人曾经回收了六十三吨废钢铁。
