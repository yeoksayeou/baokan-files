Exquisitely Carved Stone Implements

The Hunan Provincial Cultural Relics Management Committee's cleanup team discovered a batch of exquisitely carved stone implements in a Western Han tomb outside the South Gate of Changsha City. These stone implements, including stone mirrors, stone bi discs, stone pigs, stone beads, and stone cups, numbered more than twenty pieces, all meticulously carved with delicate patterns. Among them were four stone pigs of various sizes. Most notably, the abdomen of one small pig was cut open, and the throat of another small pig was pierced, a "sacrificial killing" practice that closely aligns with the "sacrifice" mentioned in ancient texts. This provides insight into the sacrificial rituals of the time.

    雕刻精巧的石制器具
    湖南省文物管理委员会清理工作队，在长沙市南门外一座西汉墓内，发现一批雕刻得非常精巧的石制器具。这些石制器具包括石镜、石璧、石猪、石珠和石杯等二十多件，都雕刻得很精巧，有很细致的花纹。其中共有大小石猪四个。最引人注意的是一个小猪腹部被剖开，另一个小猪喉部被杀穿，这种“杀祭”的做法同文献上所说的“牺牲”极相符合，由此可以了解当时的祭仪情况。
