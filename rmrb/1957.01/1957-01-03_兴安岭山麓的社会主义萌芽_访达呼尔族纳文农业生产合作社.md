Socialist Seedlings at the Foot of the Xing'an Mountains
    ——A Visit to the Daur Nationality Nawen Agricultural Production Cooperative

    Sleep! Sleep!
    Sleep soundly, baby!
    The sun shines in the cradle,
    You are as beautiful as a flower.
    Sleep, baby!
    You are like a pearl,
    Shining in your mother's hand,
    When you are about to cry,
    I put you in the cradle and rock you.
    Sleep! Baby! Sleep!
    …………
    Du Chengzhang's wife, Da'erle, sat on the edge of the kang (a heated brick bed), the newly laid white birch bark emitting a faint fragrance. She lowered her head, humming a lullaby softly, while skillfully sewing a cotton coat printed with lilac flowers. A long leather strap was looped around her ankle, the other end tied to the cradle suspended in the middle of the roof beam. The cradle swung back and forth in the air with the movement of her feet, the strings of animal bones hanging on the cradle making rhythmic sounds. Da'erle occasionally looked up to check the apple-like face lying in the cradle. The baby was sound asleep, a happy smile on his adorable lips.

    Du Chengzhang led me excitedly into his house. He introduced his wife to me, then took the hunting rifle off his shoulder, untied the sharp knife and bullet belt from his waist, hanging them one by one on the wall post. He walked to the cradle, his eyes full of joy and tenderness slowly sweeping over the face of the sleeping child. When he turned around, he caught sight of the floral cotton coat on the kang.

    "You! You should take care of yourself first," Du Chengzhang said with a grin to Da'erle, while stuffing the XingShu Dage (a type of tobacco) into his pipe. "You have to think of others too!"

    "You just made a new cotton coat for the Spring Festival, it's not even worn out, why make another one now? Isn't that a waste?" Da'erle's face flushed, she walked to the cradle, gently rocking it, and said shyly.

    "Who says it's a waste?" Du Chengzhang lit the tobacco in his pipe, handed it to me, tilted his head, and said, clearly and confidently: "That set is for work - to be worn on ordinary days, the old one is not presentable anymore; this new set is to be worn for meetings and festivals. It's not like there's no fabric in the chest, why not?"…………

    Last autumn, I came to this agricultural cooperative composed of the Daur ethnic group in Hulunbuir League. Because the time was too short, and I happened to witness this incident, I felt embarrassed to inquire about the details. Later, when I was a guest at the cooperative director's house, I finally understood the quarrel between Du Chengzhang and his wife that day, it was actually a "pleasant quarrel".

    The cooperative director said that Du Chengzhang's reasoning was justified. In mid-July last year, the trial calculation of the pre-distribution results of the agricultural cooperative showed that 70% of the total agricultural and sideline income of more than 110,000 yuan could be distributed to the members, and 99% of the members increased their income compared to the previous year. In addition, each of the 100 cooperative member households had three to five mu of private garden plots near their houses. The garden plots were planted with tobacco leaves, vegetables, and flowers such as golden hairpins, jade beauties, Jiangxi wax, and passionflowers. The wooden fences around the gardens were covered with pumpkin and zucchini seedlings, and beautiful morning glories. During holidays or leisure time, the members worked in their own gardens. These gardens were not only a significant source of sideline income but also beautified the courtyards of the members.

    Since spring, the collective sideline production of the cooperative, including hunting, picking wild mushrooms, transportation, and fishing, had earned 32,500 yuan. Besides pre-distributing a large part of it to the members for purchasing daily necessities and clothes, more than 7,000 yuan was deposited in the credit cooperative of the Gacha (village).

     "Take Du Chengzhang's family, for example!" The cooperative director raised his voice slightly: "Judging by the looks of it, he alone can earn at least 2,400 work points this year, equivalent to more than 700 yuan in Renminbi. Adding the garden plot and the four chickens, three fat pigs, and a large dairy cow raised by his wife, the income is even greater. With such prosperous days, who wouldn't want to improve their lives! Not to mention his family, even the households in our cooperative that are slightly worse off than his also have clothes for meetings and festivals, as well as clothes for work!"

    "Ultimately, under the care of the Communist Party in recent years, our Daur people are getting richer and richer!" The cooperative director pondered for a moment, then continued: "In those days of suffering before liberation, we wore hides of animals like elk and deer all year round. Where could we get cloth to wear? At that time, most family quarrels were caused by poverty and mutual resentment, and were mostly caused by anxiety about not being able to survive."

    "Did they reach a conclusion in their quarrel that day?" I was still very interested in knowing the outcome of that "pleasant quarrel".

    "Ah! Was there any question! Of course, Du Chengzhang prevailed."

    The Nawen Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative was established just last January. This socialist seed, under the cultivation of the Party, grew into a robust seedling at the foot of the Greater Khingan Mountains in the northernmost part of the motherland, along with the warm spring breeze. Like the agricultural cooperatives of other fraternal nationalities, it is thriving and growing vigorously. After the establishment of the cooperative, crops like corn, soybeans, and wheat have taken root in the land that used to be planted with coarse grains such as millet, sorghum, and oats. In my conversation with Na Kuiwu, the secretary of the Gacha Party branch, I learned that the people, who used to be accustomed to extensive farming, have implemented methods of contracting work, contracting output, and assigning responsibilities to different sections after joining the cooperative. Agricultural technology has also been significantly improved compared to the past: all the seeds for more than 400 hectares of land in the cooperative have been disinfected, 90 hectares of wheat have been completely flat-sown and densely planted, and 40% of the cultivated land has been fertilized with manure. The Han Chinese farmer brothers from the Pingdi Spring Administrative Region sent by the People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, went deep into the fields and guided the members to use thirteen double-wheeled double-furrow plows for autumn plowing.

    After lunch, Comrade Na Kuiwu took me to the fields.

    The autumn wind blew朵朵white clouds moving in the blue sky, large pieces of millet and buckwheat shone with golden light in the sun, horse-drawn harvesters waved their long arms in the wheat fields, and the songs of labor echoed in the clear sky. People welcomed the harvest in happy labor.

    "Look!" Comrade Na Kuiwu and I stood on the hillside. He drew an arc in the air and said, "This is our agricultural cooperative, this is the force that drives us forward!"

    During the lunch break, I met Ma Lajic (horse-drawn machine) operator Na Tiecheng. This man, who used to rely on relief grain, had earned more than 1,100 work points after joining the cooperative.

    "How is it? Are you used to using it?" I asked, pointing to the Ma Lajic.

    "It was a little awkward at first, but I gradually got used to it." Na Tiecheng took off the sheep's belly towel from his neck and wiped the sweat from his face, and said with a smile, "Once you get used to using it, you can't do without it."

    "Why can't you do without it?"

    "This harvester can cut three hectares and five mu of wheat a day, which is equivalent to sixteen laborers bending over and working for a day. Think about it, with it, who would want to bend over and suffer anymore!"

    "Are you happy to be a Ma Lajic operator?"

    "Of course, I'm happy." Na Tiecheng nodded and raised his thick, black eyebrows, saying, "But it's best to be a tractor driver. Ho! That old iron bull is really powerful. I saw it in Xingnong Farm, it pulls those plows from the ground and immediately cuts out deep furrows."

    "How many years do you plan to become a tractor driver?"

    "That depends on the results of our efforts. Maybe in the second five-year plan, or the third five-year plan... Judging from the fact that we are producing 3,500 jin of wheat per hectare this year, which is 1,000 jin more per hectare than last year, the days of using tractors may come even sooner."

    "You! Even if you don't become a model worker, we won't let you drive even if we have a tractor!" A young man wearing a white vest with the words "Nawen Agricultural Cooperative First Production Team" in red letters interjected and joked with him.

    "Okay! Then let's wait and see!" Perhaps because there was an outsider present, Na Tiecheng seemed a little embarrassed.

    At this time, everyone around laughed heartily, so hearty and so proud. (Attached picture)

    兴安岭山麓的社会主义萌芽
    ——访达呼尔族纳文农业生产合作社

    睡吧！睡吧！
    好好睡吧——宝宝！
    太阳照在摇车里，
    你像花朵一样美丽。
    睡吧——宝宝！
    你像一颗珍珠，
    闪着光亮在母亲的手里，
    你要张嘴哭的时候，
    我放到摇车里摇摇你。
    睡吧！宝宝！睡吧！
    …………
    杜成章的爱人达尔乐坐在炕沿上，新铺在炕上的白桦树皮散发出淡淡的香味。她低着头，一面小声地唱着催眠曲，一面灵巧地缝制着印有丁香花的棉衣。她那脚脖子上套着一根长长的皮条，皮条的另一端，系在悬到房梁中间的摇车上，摇车随着双脚的摆动，在空中来回地摇荡着，挂在摇车上的那一串串的兽骨，发出有节奏的音响。达尔乐不时地抬起头来，看看那个躺在摇车中的苹果似的面孔。宝宝睡熟了，他那可爱的嘴角上挂着一丝幸福的微笑。
    杜成章领着我兴冲冲地跨进了他的家门。他把他爱人向我作了介绍，然后从肩上取下猎枪，在腰带上解下尖刀和子弹带，一件件地挂在墙柱上，走到摇车旁用喜悦、柔和的眼睛慢慢地扫了一下熟睡中的孩子的面孔，当他转过身来后，瞥见了炕上的花棉衣。
    “你呀！还是先顾自己。”杜成章边向杏树瘩疙烟袋锅里装黄烟，边笑嘻嘻地朝达尔乐说。“也得想想别人哪！”
    “你春节刚做了一套新棉衣，还没有穿坏，现在再做，不浪费吗？”达尔乐的脸涨红了，她走到摇车旁，轻轻地摇动着摇车，羞涩涩地说。
    “谁说浪费？”杜成章燃起烟袋锅里的黄烟，递给我之后，歪着头，显然十分理直气壮：“那套是工作服——平常日子穿的，旧的不像样了；再做一套是开会和过节穿的。箱子里又不是没有布，为什么不行？”…………
    去年秋天，我来到呼伦贝尔盟达呼尔民族组成的这个农业社，因为时间太短，碰到这件事情，也不好意思打听究竟；后来，在社主任家里做客的时候，我才弄清楚了那天杜成章夫妇的口角，原来是场“愉快的争吵”。
    社主任说，杜成章的理由是有根据的。去年7月中旬，农业社试算预分的结果，可以把农业副业总收入十一万多元的70％分配给社员，99％的社员都比前年增加了收入。另外，全社一百户社员，家家房舍左近都有三亩—五亩自留的园子地。园地里种植了烟叶、蔬菜和黄金簪、玉美人、江西腊、西蕃莲等花卉，在园子周围的木栅墙上，爬满了倭瓜、西葫芦秧和美丽的牵牛花。在假日或闲暇的时候，社员们就在自己的园地里劳动。这个园地，不仅是一项很大的副业收入，而且也美化了社员的庭院。
    自从春天以来，社里光是打猎、采木耳、运输、捕鱼等集体副业生产就挣了三万二千五百元，除了把一大部分预分给社员作为购买生活日用品、添置衣服之用外，还存到嘎查的信贷社里七千多元。
      “就拿杜成章这家来说吧！”社主任略微提高了嗓音：“看样子，他一个人今年最少能挣二千四百多分，合人民币七百多元。再加上园子地和他爱人饲养的四只小鸡、三口肥猪和一条大乳牛，收入更多了。这样红火的日子，谁不要改善生活！不用说他家，在我们社里比他次点的户，也都备有开会过节的衣服和工作的衣服呢！”
    “归根结底，这几年来在共产党的关怀下，我们达呼尔民族越过越富裕啦！”社主任沉思了一会，接着说：“在解放前那些苦难的日狍里，我们一年四季都穿着猂皮和鹿皮，想穿点布，从哪里得呀？那时候家庭中的争吵，大都是因为穷困而彼此迁怒，大都是为恐怕活不下去而焦急。”
    “他俩那天争吵出眉目来了吗？”我还是很想知道那场“愉快的争吵”的结果。
    “唉！那还有问题！当然是杜成章占了上风。”
    纳文高级农业生产合作社是去年正月才建立的。这颗社会主义的种子，在党的培植下，随着和暖的春风，在祖国最北方的大兴安岭山麓，生长出了茁壮的幼芽。它像其他兄弟民族的农业社一样，正在欣欣向荣地繁茂成长。建社后，过去一直种植糜子、稷子、燕麦等草田作物的土地上，已扎下了苞米、大豆和小麦的根子。在和嘎查党支部书记那奎武同志的谈话中我了解到，往年一向是习惯粗放耕作的人们，入社后，实行了包工包产、分段负责的办法；农业技术也比过去有了显著的改进：全社四百多垧地的种子，全部进行了消毒，九十垧小麦完全平播密植，40％的耕地使用了粪肥。内蒙古自治区人民委员会从平地泉行政区派来的汉族农民兄弟组成的秋耕团，深入到田间，指导着社员用十三台双轮双铧犁进行秋翻。
    中饭后，那奎武同志带着我到了田间。
    秋风吹动着朵朵白云在蓝天上移动，大片大片的谷子和荞麦在阳光照耀下泛起了闪闪的金光，马拉收割机挥舞着长长的手臂在小麦地里奔驰，劳动的歌声在晴空中回荡，人们在愉快的劳动中迎接丰收。
    “你瞧吧！”那奎武同志同我站在山坡上，他朝着空中划了个弧形，说：“这就是我们的农业社，这就是推动我们前进的力量！”
    在歇晌的时候，我认识了马拉机操纵手那铁成。这个过去还靠救济粮生活的人，入社后已挣了一千一百多工分。
    “怎么样？用着它习惯吗？”我指着马拉机问。
    “最初有点蹩扭，慢慢地就习惯了。”那铁成从脖子上解下羊肚子毛巾揩了揩脸上的汗珠，笑呵呵地说：“用惯了它，不用就不行了。”
    “为什么不行呢？”
    “这一台收割机一天能割三垧五亩小麦，顶十六个劳动力躬着腰干一天，你想想看，有了它，谁还愿意再弯腰驼背地去受苦！”
    “你很乐意当一名马拉机操纵手吗？”
    “当然乐意。”那铁成点了点头后，扬起了两条又粗又黑的眉毛说：“不过，最好还是当一名拖拉机手。嗬！那老铁牛的劲头可真冲，我在兴农农场看见过，它拉着那一挂挂的犁铧从地上一走，立时就豁出一道道的深沟。”
    “你计划几年当上拖拉机手呢？”
    “那可得看我们努力的结果了。也许第二个五年计划，或者第三个五年中……从今年我们每垧小麦打三千五百斤，比去年每垧多产一千斤的情况来看，使用拖拉机的日子也可能还要快一些。”
    “你呀！当不上模范，就是有了拖拉机也不让你开！”旁边一个穿着印有“纳文农业社第一生产队”红字白底背心的小伙子，插上嘴和他打趣。
    “好！那咱们就走着瞧吧！”也许是身旁有外来人的原故，那铁成似乎有点尴尬。
    这时候，周围的人听了都哈哈大笑起来了，笑的是那样爽朗，那样得意。（附图片）
