    Cultivating Scientific Work Cadres
    Tian Fu
    In the past year, all scientific research personnel of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have responded to the Party's call to "approach the world's advanced scientific level within twelve years" with practical actions. In addition to dedicating themselves to scientific research, scientists have also done a lot of work in cultivating cadres, which has resulted in significant achievements in the growth of research strength. Their methods of cultivating cadres are diverse. Each discipline, each specialty, and even each mentor has different methods adapted to their own characteristics. However, they also have common experiences. Here is an introduction to their common basic experiences.
    The main source of research staff in the Academy of Sciences is college graduates. However, the majors in colleges and universities are not closely linked to the majors in scientific research departments. The disciplines in scientific research departments are more subdivided than those in colleges and universities. At the same time, some new disciplines have not yet been offered in colleges and universities. In addition, in recent years, the general basic knowledge of college graduates assigned to work at the Academy of Sciences has been insufficient or not solid enough, so that they do not understand the role of their own disciplines in human understanding and transforming the world. Therefore, when young people first arrive at the research institute, they find it difficult to choose a specific research direction. Sometimes, they can only choose a famous teacher or start from personal interests without considering the overall needs. Thus, it is necessary for the mentor to help determine the major and give the young people who have just entered the research institute a comprehensive and systematic introduction to the characteristics, development direction, and relationship with the country's socialist construction of the discipline. At the same time, the mentor also understands their professional level and cultivates their interest in the major. After six months to a year, the mentor helps them determine their professional direction based on the development of science, the needs of work, and their basic knowledge and interests. Practice has proved that this process enables young scientific workers to clearly understand their professional direction, which is the key to cultivating them. When the direction is clear, young scientific workers feel that they have a "goal" and their initiative and enthusiasm will be fully utilized, and they will make relatively rapid progress in their work.
    Clearly recognizing the professional direction gives young scientific workers a path. How to walk it should be concretized in the formulation of plans so that they feel it is "promising and achievable." Their plans are divided into long-term plans and annual plans. The long-term plan is the goal and requirement proposed by the mentor based on the long-term and current needs of the country and the conditions of the trainee in all aspects. After this, under the guidance of the mentor, the trainee, based on their own foundation and the work they are responsible for, sets out an annual plan that closely combines work and further study. In this way, on the one hand, young people can have something to follow, and on the other hand, it is convenient for mentors to supervise and inspect. Through checking their implementation of the plan, the mentor discovers what knowledge they lack or is insufficient and constantly provides specific help.
    Basic knowledge is the foundation for research work. It is difficult to do good research work if the foundation is not well laid. Also, foreign languages are one of the tools for research work. If you do not master two or more foreign languages, it is difficult to absorb knowledge in many ways and understand the development of the discipline, especially in natural sciences. Scientists have different views and specific practices on how to give young scientific workers remedial lessons. Some advocate laying a wide foundation, while others advocate making up for what is lacking according to work needs. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages. The former is more solid, but the speed is slow; the latter is more purposeful, the progress is fast, and it is easy to achieve results, but the scope is narrower. These two methods can be used separately according to different situations, but no matter which method is used, young scientific workers should always pay attention to constantly expanding their knowledge scope and pay attention to reading comprehensive literature related to their major, striving to achieve a basic understanding of the field of their discipline and its development laws (historical development process, characteristics, main problems, degree of resolution) as soon as possible.
    Young people who have just embarked on scientific research work are generally accustomed to studying but are not good at learning through their own thinking from work practice. Therefore, once they come into contact with scientific research work, they easily encounter the difficulty of not being able to think independently. Mentors need to educate young scientific workers in actual work to overcome the idea of relying too much on mentors, and consciously guide them to learn more correct ways of thinking and research methods, and overcome difficulties through their own independent thinking. Before starting work, young scientific workers should read relevant literature purposefully and planned, gradually form their own opinions on certain main issues through careful consideration, and tell their opinions to the mentor, so that they can correct the one-sidedness of their views on the issues under the guidance of the mentor and gradually improve their thinking ability. After reading the literature, the mentor can ask the students to write a report on reading the literature and select excellent ones for discussion. At the Institute of Mathematics and the Institute of Geophysics, discussion classes have been organized in a planned way, which can achieve the effect of mutual inspiration and mutual help through collective discussion on the basis of the participants' individual hard work.
    After young scientific workers have grown to a certain stage, they should gradually be allowed to work independently. When starting research work, their topics should preferably be a part or a branch of the mentor's overall research topic. In this way, the mentor can easily provide specific guidance to the young people without hindering their independent thinking. When young scientific workers take on the responsibility of independently considering certain issues, their enthusiasm will greatly increase. Especially when they have investigated the relevant previous work and compared and analyzed various experimental methods and results in conjunction with the problems to be solved, they will develop a strong interest in the work. However, at this time they will also encounter difficulties, often suffering because they cannot find the key factors to solve a certain problem. At this time, the mentor must cultivate the young people's tenacious will and strong confidence in materialism. When his students encountered difficulties and became discouraged, scientist Lu Xueshan confidently pointed out: "Firmly believe that there is only one objective truth, and it exists and can be found, and it is not allowed to doubt this point no matter how difficult it is." Educate young people to use a tenacious will and a rigorous, down-to-earth, and meticulous work attitude to explore hard until the problem is solved. Their process of overcoming difficulties is also the process of exercising independent thinking.
    How to specifically apply the above basic experiences depends on the creative cooperation between scientists and young scientific workers. Scientists try to give play to the enthusiasm and independent working ability of young scientific workers, and teach students in accordance with their aptitude. Starting from the specific conditions of young scientific workers, as their working ability improves, they are assigned work of different levels of difficulty, so that their professional level can be continuously improved. Young scientific workers pay attention to overcoming the idea of dependence, promoting initiative, being diligent in observation, diligent in thinking, diligent in asking for advice, and diligent in doing things, and gradually improving their independent working ability.
    The cultivation of scientific work cadres is a long-term work. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has recently learned through summarizing the experience of cultivation work that there are some problems that need to be solved urgently.
    First, the leadership lags behind the masses. Since the Party Central Committee put forward the call to "approach the world's advanced scientific level within twelve years," the entire Academy has set off a wave of marching toward science: young people have formulated further study plans one after another, requesting the leadership to quickly clarify and decide their professional direction and strengthen their cultivation; most scientists are also quite concerned about the cultivation of cadres and have done a lot of work. However, the organizational leadership work of most research institutes, especially the relevant leading departments of the Academy, has not kept up, and has not timely summarized the experience of cultivating cadres in the past, and put forward the principles, systems and methods for cultivating scientific work cadres on the basis of the summary, so it once caused ideological confusion among young people in the initial stage. Although there have been great changes since then, the phenomenon of imbalance still exists. Now the leadership of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is studying and formulating a system for cultivating cadres and a plan for political and ideological work with relevant departments.
    Second, there is no consistent understanding of the cultivation of scientific work cadres. First of all, it is reflected in the relationship between learning and work. Some young people overemphasize systematic theoretical learning and ignore learning in work practice; while some scientists focus on research work and underestimate cultivation work. Individual scientists even only use but not cultivate. The emergence of this contradiction is on the one hand because some young people have not gone into the work and cannot realize how to improve themselves through work, and on the other hand because some scientists have always assigned young people work of the same level, so that they cannot improve. To solve this contradiction, on the one hand, young people are required to be good at exercising and improving themselves from work, and on the other hand, scientists are required to pay attention to the nature, type and degree of the work assigned to them, so that they can continue to improve. Secondly, there is also a problem with the understanding of "talent." Some scientists still have a strong "genius" view, only paying attention to "teaching those with talent," often not paying attention to the fact that special talents are only a minority after all; at the same time, some young people do not start from their own actual conditions, and want to cultivate themselves into scientists as soon as they arrive at the Academy of Sciences. Obviously, this will affect the healthy development of cultivation work.
    Third, some scientists have problems with the methods of cultivating scientific cadres. Some scientists still follow the old methods of their teachers in the past, without a plan or system, mainly relying on their own exploration, and do not even explain the meaning and purpose of the work clearly, only holding the attitude of "wait and see, it counts when it arrives," so that young people feel lost. Some scientists have arranged the work too specifically, so that students have no room for independent thinking.
    Fourth, the professional level of young scientific workers is too low. In recent years, college graduates assigned to the Academy of Sciences generally have poor basic knowledge and foreign languages. After arriving at various research institutes, they have to spend a long time making up lessons, which is a reason why young scientific workers are not easy to grow. This depends on the universal improvement of the quality of college graduates. At the same time, it is hoped that when colleges and universities send graduates to scientific research departments in the future, they will especially consider their basic knowledge and foreign language level, and select outstanding students as much as possible.

    培养科学工作干部
    田夫
    一年来，中国科学院全体科学研究工作人员，都用实际行动回答了党提出的“十二年内接近世界科学先进水平”的号召。科学家们除了忘我地从事科学研究工作以外，在培养干部方面也进行了许多工作，使得研究力量的成长有了显著成绩。他们培养干部的方法是多种多样的，各学科、各专业以至各个导师，都有着不同的适应各自特点的方法，但是他们也有着共同的经验，这里介绍一下他们共同的基本经验。
    科学院研究工作人员的主要来源是高等学校毕业生。但是高等学校的专业同科学研究部门的专业并不是紧密衔接的。科学研究部门的学科比高等学校分得更细，同时有些新的学科在高等学校里还没有开设，加上几年来分配到科学院工作的高等学校毕业生一般的基础知识不足或者学得不够扎实，以致他们对本门学科以及对它在人类认识世界、改造世界中的作用了解不够。所以青年们初到研究所的时候对于选择研究的具体方向感到困难，有时他们只能从挑选名师或者仅从个人兴趣出发而不顾及整体需要。这样就有必要由导师帮助确定专业，给初进入研究所的青年全面地系统地介绍本门学科的特点、发展方向以及它同国家社会主义建设的关系，同时导师也了解他们的业务水平，培养他们对专业的兴趣。经过半年到一年的时间，导师根据科学发展情况、工作需要并结合他们的基础知识和志趣，再帮助他们确定专业方向。实践证明，经过这样一个过程使青年科学工作者明确认识他们的专业方向，是培养他们的关键。当方向明确以后，青年科学工作者们感到有了“奔头”，主动性积极性就会充分地发挥出来，在业务上就会有比较快的进步。
    明确认识了专业方向，给青年科学工作者指出了一条道路，怎样走还应该在制定计划中具体化，使他们感到“可望而可及”。他们的计划分远景规划和年度计划。远景规划就是导师根据国家长远和当前的需要结合被指导者各方面的条件，所提出的目标和要求。这以后，在导师指导下，被培养者根据自己的基础和所担负的工作，定出工作同进修密切结合的年度计划。这样，一方面可以使青年有所遵循，另一方面便于导师督促检查；导师通过检查他们对计划的执行情况，发现他们那些知识缺乏或者不足，不断地给以具体帮助。
    基础知识是进行研究工作的根基，根基没打好要搞好研究工作是很困难的；还有外国文，它是进行研究工作的工具之一，如果不掌握两种以上的外国文就很难多方面地吸收知识和了解本门学科的发展情况，特别是自然科学。怎样给青年科学工作者补课，科学家们的看法和具体做法并不一致，有人主张广泛地打基础，有人主张根据工作需要缺什么补什么。这两种方法各有利弊，前者学的更扎实些，但是速度慢；后者目的性明确，进度快，容易收效，但是面较窄。这两种方法可以根据不同情况分别采用，但是无论采用哪一种方法，年青的科学工作者们要经常注意不断扩大自己的知识范围，注意阅读本专业有关的综合性的文献，力求尽快对本门学科的领域和它的发展规律（历史发展过程、特性、目前的主要问题、解决程度）作到基本上了解。
    刚走上科学研究工作岗位的青年，一般都习惯于念书，而不善于从工作实践中通过自己的思考来进行学习，所以当他们一旦接触科学研究工作就容易遇到不会独立思考的困难。导师有必要在实际工作中教育青年科学工作者克服过多依赖导师的思想，有意识地引导他们多学习正确的思想方法和研究方法，通过各自的独立思考克服困难。青年科学工作者们在开始工作以前，有目的有计划地阅读有关文献，通过深思熟虑对某些主要问题逐渐形成自己的见解，并把自己的见解告诉导师，以便在导师的指导下纠正自己对问题看法的片面性，逐步提高自己的思考能力。在阅读文献以后，导师可以要求学生写出阅读文献的报告，选择优秀的组织讨论。在数学研究所和地球物理研究所就曾经有计划地组织过讨论班，它可以在参加者个人刻苦钻研的基础上用集体讨论的方式，收互相启发、互相帮助的效果。
    在青年科学工作者成长到一定阶段以后，就应该逐渐让他们独立工作。开始作研究工作的时候，他们的题目最好是导师总的研究题目的一部分或者一个分枝，这样导师既便于对青年人进行具体指导，又不妨碍青年人的独立思考。当青年科学工作者担负了独立地考虑一定的问题的责任以后，他们的积极性会大为增加。尤其当他们对有关的前人的工作作了调查，把各种实验方法和所得结果结合当前所要解决的问题作了比较和分析的时候，他们会对工作发生浓厚的兴趣。但是这时候他们也会遇到困难，往往因为找不到解决某一问题的关键性因素而苦恼起来。这时候导师要培植青年人的顽强的意志和对唯物主义的坚强信心。科学家陆学善先生当他的学生遇到困难而灰心的时候，他就满怀信心地指出：“坚信客观真理只有一个，而它是存在的，可以找到的，无论在多么困难的时候不容许对这一点发生怀疑”。教育青年人要用顽强的意志和严谨踏实、一丝不苟的工作态度去努力探讨，一直到问题解决为止。他们克服困难的过程，也就是锻炼独立思考的过程。
    上述基本经验如何具体运用，关键在于科学家同青年科学工作者的创造性的合作。科学家设法发挥青年科学工作者的积极性和独立工作能力，作到因材施教，从青年科学工作者的具体条件出发，随着他们的工作能力的提高，交给他们困难程度不同的工作，使他们的业务水平能够不断地提高；青年科学工作者注意克服依赖思想、发扬主动性，勤观察、勤思考、勤请教、勤动手，逐步提高独立工作能力。
    科学工作干部的培养是一个长期性的工作。中国科学院最近通过对培养工作经验的总结，了解到目前有一些问题急待解决。
    第一，领导落后于群众。自从党中央提出“十二年内接近世界科学先进水平”的号召以后，全科学院掀起了向科学进军的热潮：青年们纷纷制定进修规划，要求领导上尽快地明确决定他们的专业方向，加强对他们的培养；大部分科学家对培养干部也相当关心，进行了许多工作。但是大多数研究所特别是院里各有关领导部门的组织领导工作没有跟上去，没及时总结已往培养干部的经验，并在总结的基础上提出培养科学工作干部的方针、制度和方法，因此在初期曾经一度引起青年们的思想混乱。以后虽然有了很大改变，但是不平衡的现象仍然存在。现在中国科学院的领导方面正同有关部门研究制定培养干部的制度和政治思想工作方案。
    第二，对培养科学工作干部的认识不一致。首先表现在对学习同工作的关系问题上，部分青年人过分强调系统的理论学习，忽视在工作实践中学习；而部分科学家则重研究工作、轻培养工作，个别科学家甚至只使用不培养。这一矛盾的产生，一方面是有些青年在工作上没有钻进去，体会不到如何通过工作来提高自己，而另一方面有些科学家一直只交给青年人同类程度的工作，使他们得不到提高。要解决这一矛盾，一方面要求青年善于从工作中锻炼提高自己，另一方面要求科学家们注意交给他们的工作性质、种类和程度，使他们能够不断提高。其次，对于“才”的认识也有问题。有些科学家的“天才”观点还很浓厚，只注意“有才施教”，往往不注意特殊的天才毕竟是少数；同时有些青年人不从自己的实际条件出发，一到科学院就想把自己培养成科学家。显然这都会影响培养工作不能够健康地开展。
    第三，部分科学家在培养科学干部的方法上有问题。有的科学家还是按照过去老师带他们的老方法，既没有计划，又没有系统，主要是靠自己的摸索，连工作的意义和目的都不给说清楚，只抱“走着瞧、到了算”的态度，因而使青年人感到茫无方向。还有的科学家对工作布置得太具体，使学生没有独立思考的余地。
    第四，青年科学工作者的业务水平太低。几年来分配到科学院的高等学校毕业生，一般的基础知识和外国文都比较差，到各研究所以后要花很长时间补课，这是青年科学工作者不容易成长的一个原因。这有待于高等学校毕业生质量的普遍提高，同时也希望各高等学校今后向科学研究部门输送毕业生的时候，特别考虑到他们的基础知识和外国文程度，尽可能选拔优秀生。
