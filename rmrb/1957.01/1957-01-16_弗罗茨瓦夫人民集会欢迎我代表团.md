Xinhua News Agency, Wrocław, January 15th: Nearly ten thousand people from all walks of life in Wrocław, an industrial city in Silesia, Poland, gathered in Wrocław's People's Hall on the afternoon of the 14th to welcome the Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai.

The meeting hall was decorated with Chinese and Polish national flags, each about twenty meters long, as well as banners written in both Chinese and Polish: "Long Live the Fraternal Friendship Between the Chinese and Polish People."

After the chairman of the Wrocław City People's Council, Krull, announced the opening of the meeting, Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki delivered a speech. Rapacki first expressed a warm welcome to the Chinese guests. He said that the Polish people had been very concerned about the Chinese people's struggle for liberation in the past. The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, had achieved a great victory in the struggle for liberation. The People's Republic of China had become the second powerful country in our camp after the Soviet Union. Rapacki emphasized the importance of the unity of socialist countries. He then said to the Chinese guests: Your visit to Poland will surely and has already become an important event in our mutual relations, which will promote friendship between us and strengthen the unity of the entire socialist camp. Rapacki said that the Polish people still faced many difficulties. Enemies are trying to push us off the road of socialism. Therefore, we must launch a struggle to unite all forces on the basis of the program of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish National Unity Front. This struggle will surely be victorious.

Next, Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech to the enthusiastic welcoming crowd.

Premier Zhou first extended fraternal greetings on behalf of the Chinese government and people to the people of this industrial city, which had been rebuilt from the ruins of World War II. Zhou Enlai pointed out that the Polish people, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, had transformed Poland from an agricultural country into a socialist industrial country. The Chinese people are excited about the great achievements made by the fraternal Polish people.

Zhou Enlai said: "We also understand that the Polish people have encountered many difficulties and setbacks while making great achievements in socialist construction. The Polish United Workers' Party openly criticized the mistakes in its work in front of the people and demonstrated great courage and determination to correct these mistakes at the Eighth Plenary Session. At present, the United Workers' Party, headed by Comrade Gomulka, is carrying out a resolute struggle to safeguard and develop Poland's socialist cause. We firmly believe that the Polish people, united around the Polish United Workers' Party, will gradually overcome difficulties and move towards new victories in the great cause of building socialism."

Speaking of the relations between socialist countries, Zhou Enlai said: Our socialist countries' overcoming difficulties and moving towards new victories will not please the imperialists. Although we firmly implement the policy of peaceful coexistence and easing international tensions, the imperialists have never abandoned their ambition to subvert our socialist countries and enslave the people of the world. Therefore, the people of our socialist countries must protect the unity of our socialist countries like the apple of their eye. The Chinese people are very pleased to see that, thanks to the joint efforts of Poland and the Soviet Union, the talks between the two countries in November last year eliminated certain abnormal situations that had existed in the relations between the two countries, providing a good start for further strengthening unity and cooperation between the two countries. The Marxist-Leninist principles of national equality and proletarian internationalism, which were once again affirmed by the Polish-Soviet talks, are the unshakable foundation for the fraternal friendship and close cooperation between socialist countries.

Premier Zhou Enlai also said: "The Chinese people cannot fail to see that, under the instigation and connivance of imperialist aggressive blocs, West German militarists, in violation of international agreements, are constantly clamoring to undermine Poland's western border, attempting to provoke and alienate the two great nations of Poland and Germany. The Chinese people resolutely oppose this attempt. The Chinese people believe that Poland's current western border is a peaceful and friendly border between Poland and Germany. The Chinese people believe that the Polish people and the German people, especially the two socialist countries, the People's Republic of Poland and the German Democratic Republic, will, in the spirit of national equality and proletarian internationalism, expose and defeat these provocations and alienations and strengthen their friendly unity."

Premier Zhou's speech was repeatedly interrupted by warm applause. After the speech, twenty boys and girls walked to the podium and gave bunches of flowers and their beloved mud dolls dressed in traditional ethnic costumes to the Chinese uncles. A girl in her teens paid tribute to Premier Zhou Enlai and the Chinese government and people on behalf of the children of Wrocław and sent greetings to the children of China. Then, everyone stood up and sang the Internationale.

After the meeting, the famous Polish Slonsk Song and Dance Ensemble performed traditional Lower Silesian songs and dances for the Chinese guests.

Xinhua News Agency, Wrocław, January 15th: After arriving in Wrocław on the 14th, the Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai immediately went to visit Poland's largest Pafawag carriage factory. The factory director, Slusarek, accompanied the guests on a tour of the entire production process, and the Chinese guests also inquired about the production situation from the factory director. In the assembly workshop, Premier Zhou Enlai asked the secretary of the United Workers' Party branch in the workshop about the organization and work of the workshop's party organization. In the machining workshop, Premier Zhou Enlai inquired about the workers' wages and living conditions. Finally, Premier Zhou and others visited the carriages produced by the factory.

    弗罗茨瓦夫人民集会欢迎我代表团
    周总理发表演说：深信团结在统一工人党周围的波兰人民一定会走向新的胜利。要像保护自己的眼珠一样保护社会主义各国的团结。坚决反对帝国主义破坏波兰西部边界的企图。
    新华社弗罗茨瓦夫15日电　14日下午，波兰西里西亚的工业城市弗罗茨瓦夫各界人民近一万人，在弗罗茨瓦夫的人民大厅里集会欢迎以周恩来总理为首的中国政府代表团。
    会场上挂着约二十公尺长的中波两国国旗，还挂着用中波两国文字写的标语“中国人民和波兰人民的兄弟友谊万岁”。
    在弗罗茨瓦夫市人民会议主席克鲁耳宣布开会以后，首先由波兰外交部长拉帕茨基致词。拉帕茨基首先表示对中国客人的热烈欢迎。他说，波兰人民过去很关心中国人民的解放斗争。中国人民在中国共产党的领导下取得了解放斗争的伟大胜利。中华人民共和国成为除了苏联以外在我们阵营中的第二个强大的国家。拉帕茨基强调指出社会主义各国团结的重要性。接着，他向中国客人们说：你们到波兰访问一定会而且已经成为我们相互关系中的重要事件，这会促进我们之间的友谊，加强整个社会主义阵营的团结。拉帕茨基说，波兰人民面前还有很多困难。敌人企图把我们推出社会主义的道路。因此必须展开斗争，在波兰统一工人党和波兰全国统一阵线的纲领的基础上团结一切力量。这个斗争一定能够获得胜利。
    接着，周恩来总理向热情的欢迎群众发表了演说。
    周总理首先代表中国政府和人民向这个从第二次世界大战的废墟中重建起来的工业城市的人民致兄弟的敬礼。周恩来指出，波兰人民在波兰统一工人党的领导下已经把波兰从一个农业国建设成为社会主义工业国。中国人民为兄弟的波兰人民取得的伟大成就感到兴奋。
    周恩来说：“我们也了解到，波兰人民在取得社会主义建设的巨大成就的同时，也遇到了不少的困难和挫折。波兰统一工人党在人民群众面前公开地批评了自己工作中的错误，并且在八中全会上表现了纠正错误的巨大勇气和决心。目前，以哥穆尔卡同志为首的统一工人党正在为维护和发展波兰社会主义事业进行着坚决的斗争。我们深信，团结在波兰统一工人党周围的波兰人民，一定会逐步地克服困难，在建设社会主义的伟大事业中走向新的胜利。”
    在谈到社会主义国家之间的关系时，周恩来说：我们社会主义国家克服困难，走向新的胜利，是不会使帝国主义者高兴的。尽管我们坚定地执行着和平共处和和缓国际紧张局势的政策，帝国主义者却始终没有放弃颠覆我们社会主义国家和奴役世界人民的野心。因此，我们社会主义国家的人民必须像保护自己的眼珠一样，保护我们社会主义各国的团结。中国人民十分高兴地看到，由于波兰和苏联的共同努力，去年11月的两国会谈消除了两国关系中曾经存在过的某些不正常的情况，为两国进一步加强团结和合作作了良好的开端。波苏会谈所再一次肯定的马克思列宁主义关于民族平等和无产阶级国际主义的原则，是社会主义各国之间的兄弟友谊和亲密合作的不可动摇的基础。
    周恩来总理又说：“中国人民不能不看到，西德军国主义者在帝国主义侵略集团的指使和纵容下，违背国际协议，不断地叫嚣要破坏波兰西部的边界，企图挑拨和离间波兰和德意志两个伟大的民族。中国人民坚决地反对这种企图。中国人民认为波兰西部现有的边界是波兰和德意志之间的和平的边界，友好的边界。中国人民相信，波兰人民和德意志人民，特别是波兰人民共和国和德意志民主共和国两个社会主义国家，将会本着民族平等和无产阶级国际主义的精神，揭破和击退这些挑拨和离间，加强双方的友好团结 。”
    周总理的演说不断为热烈的鼓掌声所打断。演说完毕后，二十个男女儿童走上主席台，把一束束的鲜花和他们心爱的穿着民族古装的泥娃娃送给中国叔叔。一个十多岁的女孩代表弗罗茨瓦夫儿童向周恩来总理和中国政府和人民致敬，向中国的孩子们问好。接着，全体起立唱国际歌。
    会后，波兰著名的什龙斯克歌舞团为中国客人们表演了下西里西亚传统的歌舞节目。
    据新华社弗罗茨瓦夫15日电以周恩来总理为首的中国政府代表团14日在到达弗罗茨瓦夫以后，立刻前往波兰最大的帕伐瓦格车厢制造厂参观。工厂厂长斯路萨尔克陪同客人们参观了整个生产过程，中国客人还向厂长询问了生产情况。在装配车间里，周恩来总理询问了车间统一工人党党组织书记关于车间党的组织和工作的情况。在机械加工车间，周总理询问了工人的工资和生活情况。周总理等最后参观了工厂生产出来的车厢。
