Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 7th. The 62nd annual meeting of the Indian National Congress held in Indore concluded on the evening of January 6th after passing a resolution on international issues. The resolution expressed agreement with the Indian government's foreign policy and called for peaceful coexistence free from the threat of war.

Prior to this, the annual meeting adopted the election manifesto drafted by the Congress Party for the general election to be held in late February.

Prime Minister Nehru, speaking after the passage of the resolution on international issues, said that in the present world, it is not easy for any country—whether large or small—to carry out aggression, because all the people in the world strongly desire peace. However, he regretted that some politicians in some countries still do not recognize the truth that militarism cannot lead to the solution of problems.

Nehru said that military treaties and alliances exacerbate the danger of world war. He said that India strongly opposes the Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. One treaty is on India's right, and the other is on India's left. He said that these military alliances are a threat to peace and a threat to countries that are pursuing the path of peace.

    印度国大党年会闭幕
    通过决议呼吁实行和平共处
    新华社新德里7日电　在印度尔举行的印度国大党第六十二届年会在1月6日晚通过了关于国际问题的决议后宣告闭幕。决议表示同意印度政府的外交政策，并且呼吁实行不受战争威胁的和平共处。
    在这以前，年会通过了国大党为将在2月下旬开始的大选而拟订的竞选宣言。
    尼赫鲁总理在通过关于国际问题的决议后发言说，在现在的世界中，任何国家——不论大或小——要进行侵略都不是容易的，因为世界上所有的人民都强烈地希望和平。但是，他感到遗憾，有些国家的有些政治家仍然没有认清黩武主义不能导致问题的解决这一真理。
    尼赫鲁说军事条约和联盟加剧了世界大战的危险。他说，印度强烈反对巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织。一个条约是在印度的右面，另一个在印度的左面。他说，这些军事联盟是对和平的威胁，是对走和平道路的国家的威胁。
