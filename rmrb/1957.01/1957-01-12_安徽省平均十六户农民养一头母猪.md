Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, January 11th: According to statistics from the Animal Husbandry Department of the Anhui Provincial Department of Agriculture, by the end of last year, Anhui Province had an average of one sow per sixteen farm households. Due to the increase in sows, piglets had a source, and the number of pigs raised in the province last year increased by approximately 46% compared to 1955.
    Anhui Province suffered a major flood in 1954, resulting in a significant loss of sows, and various regions felt a shortage of pig sources. Last year, the province actively led agricultural cooperatives in various regions to breed and raise their own pigs, providing support in terms of "three fixings" (fixed output, fixed purchase, fixed sales) grain retention and loans. As a result, sow breeding increased rapidly, and by the end of the year, the number of sows in the province increased from the original 150,000 to 400,000. At the same time, self-breeding and self-raising have a significant effect on reducing pig diseases and mortality. For example, in the suburban areas of Hefei City, most of the pigs raised in the spring of last year were purchased from other places, with a mortality rate of 9.6%. In the second half of the year, due to the realization of self-breeding and self-raising, the mortality rate of pigs decreased to 0.8%.
    In order to further develop the pig raising industry, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently made arrangements, requiring the raising of an additional 200,000 sows this year; and also to increase the number of breeding boars, requiring an average of one boar for every fifteen to twenty sows.

    安徽省平均十六户农民养一头母猪
    新华社合肥11日电　据安徽省农业厅畜产处统计，截止去年底，安徽省平均每十六户农民养一头母猪。由于母猪增多，仔猪有了来源，全省去年养猪的数量比1955年增加了46％左右。
    安徽省在1954年遭受大水灾之后，母猪损失很大，各地曾经都感到猪源缺乏。去年，省里就积极领导各地农业社自繁自养，大量饲养母猪，在“三定”留粮和贷款方面也给予支持。因此，母猪饲养量增加很快，到年底，全省的母猪就由原来的十五万头增加到四十万头。同时，自繁自养对减少猪的病疫和死亡也有显著作用。如合肥市郊区，去年春季饲养的猪大都是从外地买来的，死亡率达到9.6％，下半年因为实现了自繁自养，猪的死亡率降低到0.8％。
    为了进一步发展养猪业，最近中共安徽省委又作了布置，要求今年再增养母猪二十万头；并且要增养种公猪，要求平均每十五头到二十头母猪有一头公猪。
