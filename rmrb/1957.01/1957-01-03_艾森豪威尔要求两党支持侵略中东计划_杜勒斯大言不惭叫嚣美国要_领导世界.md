Xinhua News Agency, 2nd January: Washington News: U.S. President Eisenhower held a lengthy meeting with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders at the White House on January 1. After the meeting, he announced that he hoped Congress would quickly pass a proposal to implement the "Eisenhower Doctrine" he plans to promote in the Middle East.

Eisenhower said that after Congress reconvenes on the 3rd, he will immediately submit a special message to Congress on the Middle East issue. In this regard, he hopes to receive bipartisan support.

According to a statement issued by the White House, Eisenhower suggested at the meeting that Congress take two steps regarding the Middle East policy: (1) Approve an expanded economic "aid" program for Middle Eastern countries; (2) Support a proposal aimed at preventing so-called "communist aggression" in the Middle East. Eisenhower did not specify the details of these two suggestions at the meeting. However, it was revealed that he was actually asking Congress to authorize him to use force in the Middle East "when necessary" and to allocate approximately $400 million for so-called "aid" to Middle Eastern countries over a two-year period.

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles also gave a report on the international situation at the meeting. He repeated the so-called "deterioration" of the position of international communism and believed that the United States currently "has a great opportunity to lead the world."

It is reported that congressional leaders did not reach a consensus on Eisenhower's proposals at this meeting. Senate Democratic Leader Johnson said: "This is an issue with serious implications, and therefore the relevant committees of Congress must ascertain the facts and draw appropriate conclusions." House Speaker, Democrat Rayburn, said that it would be unwise to act on the government's proposals if Congress has "serious disagreements." Senator Green, who is about to take over as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that he thought Eisenhower's views on the Middle East issue were "very vague" and that he was unwilling to express his opinion immediately. Prior to this, some influential Democratic members of Congress had openly expressed their disapproval of authorizing Eisenhower to use force in the Middle East, believing that such a policy would subject the United States to criticism from world public opinion.

    艾森豪威尔要求两党支持侵略中东计划
    杜勒斯大言不惭叫嚣美国要“领导世界”
    新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔1月1日在白宫同民主党和共和党的国会领袖进行长时间的会谈。他在会谈后宣布，他希望国会尽速通过一项提案，以贯彻他准备在中东推行的“艾森豪威尔主义”。
    艾森豪威尔说，在国会在3日复会以后，他将立即就中东问题向国会提出一项特别咨文。在这方面，他希望能够得到两党的支持。
    据白宫发表的声明说，艾森豪威尔在这次会谈中建议国会就中东政策采取两个步骤：（一）批准一项扩大的对中东国家的经济“援助”计划；（二）支持一项目的在于在中东阻止所谓“共产党侵略”的提案。艾森豪威尔在会上并没有确切地说明这两个建议的具体内容。但是据透露，他实际上是要求国会授权他在“必要时”在中东使用武力，并且拨出约四亿美元，在两年的期间内对中东国家进行所谓“援助”。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在会上也作了一个关于国际形势的报告。他重复所谓国际共产主义的地位的“恶化”，并且认为美国目前“有伟大的机会来领导世界”。
    据报道，在这次会议上，国会领袖们并没有对艾森豪威尔的建议达成一致的看法。参议院民主党领袖约翰逊说：“这是一个具有严重影响的问题，因而国会各有关委员会必须查明事实和得出适当的结论。”众议院议长、民主党人雷朋说，如果国会有“严重的分歧”，那么就政府的建议采取行动就是不智的。将要接任参议院外交委员会主席的参议员格林说，他认为艾森豪威尔对中东问题的意见是“很含糊”的，他不愿意马上表示意见。在这以前，民主党的一些有势力的议员还公开表示不赞成授权艾森豪威尔在中东使用武力，认为这种政策将使美国遭到世界舆论的指责。
