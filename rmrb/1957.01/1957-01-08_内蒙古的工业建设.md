Industrial Construction in Inner Mongolia
By our correspondent Lin Mo

When speaking of the industrial construction of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, one must first discuss the wishes of the people of all ethnic groups here for industrialization. This reminds me of an incident. One day in the winter of the year before last, I went to Zhalute Banner for an interview. At night, I chatted around the stove with Comrade Ge Gemude, the head of the Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Department of the Banner Party Committee. Zhalute Banner is considered a remote and inconspicuous place in Inner Mongolia. In the past, due to inconvenient transportation, few outsiders came to this place. But like other places in Inner Mongolia, once you go there, you will recognize its vast land and abundant resources. This banner is 800 li long and 250 li wide, with a population of only over 50,000. Ge Gemude said: "We have large pastures here for raising fat cattle, strong horses, and sheep. The wasteland is endless and very fertile! The soil behind the north mountain is three to four feet deep and all black. Rice can be grown using the water from the mountain gullies, yielding dozens of dan per hectare. There is endless firewood in the mountains. Some farmers from other places who come here say that this place is full of gold, almost burying people up to their necks! We really have gold mines here, as well as large coalfields and graphite deposits. Speaking of underground treasures, who knows how much there is!"

Ge Gemude became more and more excited as he spoke. The red stove fire illuminated his glowing face.

	"Look at this coal!" He picked up a piece of coal from beside the stove and put it in my hand as if he had discovered a treasure. The coal was as hard as stone, burned with great heat, and would last all day when loaded into the stove.

	"Do you know where this coal comes from? – Not far from here. Recently, geological workers came to see it. Preliminary investigations show that there is a piece of land 30 li long and 20 li wide where the underground is full of this kind of coal, with a layer three to four meters thick. They have taken samples away for testing. If it can be used as industrial coal, the state may carry out large-scale mining. That would be really great, really great!"

	"Really great!" This statement had two meanings for him: First, the rich treasures under the land where his ethnic group lives have been buried for thousands of years, and no one has paid attention to them in the past. Now that they have been discovered, they can contribute to the country's industrial construction and become a valuable asset to the people of the whole country, for which he feels extremely honored. At the same time, with the establishment of mines and factories in his hometown, the economic and cultural life of the people will undergo tremendous changes. Lubbei (where the Banner government is located) will no longer be a deserted small town, but will become a prosperous and colorful city.

Many people, like Ge Gemude, hold eager wishes for industrialization. On the desks of some league and banner cadres, local mineral deposits are often displayed, some placed in exquisite glass boxes, lined with colorful silk. These are mostly gifts given to the local people by the exploration teams sent by the state as a way of announcing good news. These gifts have become a symbol of glory for this land, and a beautiful hope and legendary tale in the hearts of the local people.

In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, a virgin land waiting to be developed, dozens of exploration teams have been active in recent years. They have found large amounts of coal, iron, certain rare metals, and non-ferrous metals. And more treasures await these explorers to discover.

There was a Mongolian worker named Boerbo who participated in the work of the exploration team. Whenever he met people from his hometown and they asked him where he worked, he would reply with a smile, "I work in industrialization, and there is a good life for us in industrialization!" In Boerbo's view, industrialization is like the "treasure box" in fairy tales, which contains everything needed for a peaceful and happy life.

And this "treasure box" is no longer a myth or people's hope. Since the founding of New China, more than 300 factories and mines of various sizes have appeared on the land of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and in the lives of people of all ethnic groups!

Inner Mongolia is a region with a highly developed animal husbandry industry, and has a large amount of livestock products that can be used as raw materials for light industry. The Autonomous Region currently has two meat combined processing plants, one woolen mill, two larger leather factories, and three larger dairy product factories. Most of these factories are mechanized and capable of large-scale production. The Hailar Meat Combined Processing Plant can process hundreds of cattle or thousands of sheep every day.

The Baotou area in western Inner Mongolia is also a good sugar beet producing area, with a higher sugar content than many other places in the country. A modern Baotou Sugar Factory has been built here, capable of producing more than 140 tons of Prairie brand white granulated sugar every day. According to long-term plans, several modern large sugar factories will be established in the Baotou and Hohhot areas to become a sugar industry base in northern China.

Now, the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are able to eat sugar, meat, milk powder, and cream produced by factories in the region, and can wear locally made woolen and leather products. These products are also supplied to various parts of the country, and some can even be exported abroad.

The small and medium-sized machinery manufacturing industry serving agricultural and animal husbandry production has developed rapidly in recent years. There are dozens of such factories in the region, producing large quantities of new-style agricultural tools, waterwheels, locomobiles, and cream separators, shearing machines, and other equipment used by herdsmen.

Before liberation, the only industries in Inner Mongolia that could barely be called modern were a few dilapidated power plants and a woolen mill. Now the industrial technology and production capacity of the Autonomous Region have increased tenfold or a hundredfold.

What attracts the attention of all ethnic groups even more is that the state has begun the construction of heavy industry in the Inner Mongolia region. In the western part of Inner Mongolia, there is a place called Baiyunebo, which translates to Rich Mountain, and it used to be an iron mountain. The amount of iron ore and the high proportion of iron in the ore are rare in the world. Due to the discovery of this large iron ore deposit, a huge iron and steel industrial base is being built in the Baotou area. Everyone knows that the completion of the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant attracted the attention of the people all over the country. The scale of the construction of the Baotou industrial base, in terms of several major factories and mines, is much larger than that of the Changchun Automobile Plant. And its role is unparalleled. The construction of the Baotou Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise has a significant effect on the industrialization of the motherland, and will also fundamentally change the backward appearance of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

The city of Baotou originally had only 140,000 people and was a small and medium-sized city lacking a modern industrial base. After the completion of the iron and steel industry, it will become a large industrial city with nearly one million people. By then, Baotou will be full of chimneys, flowing molten steel, cars and trains coming and going, and science and technology will have great development. It will be a very prosperous socialist new city with enormous production power.

In the new urban area of Baotou, what was still a barren wasteland two years ago is now undergoing large-scale construction activities in an area of dozens of miles, with rows of buildings and houses appearing. 150,000 people have come from all over the country – the builders of the industrial base and their families – and are starting the construction of a new industrial city here.

The construction of large-scale industries in Baotou has also driven the rapid development of local industries. In 1952, the city had 19 small and medium-sized factories with about 1,000 production workers. By 1956, the number of factories had increased to 42, and the number of production workers and annual output value had both expanded more than tenfold.

In the eastern part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, there is the Greater Khingan Range, the largest forest area in China. This is a green ocean, with dense larch and birch trees growing on the rolling hills, about 160,000 trees per square kilometer. How much building material for cities and how many hundreds of thousands of kilometers of railway sleepers can be provided by these precious timbers! Is it because of its huge wealth, or because the forest makes the land more beautiful and colorful? The local people have always affectionately called it the "Golden Khingan Range". In Mongolian folk songs, people once sang it with such enthusiasm:

	Climbing the Khingan, the golden Khingan,
	Looking from the high mountains, oh,
	It seems like seeing my father's hometown,
	The Mongolian true clan!

The Greater Khingan Range is now not only a place where people sing while looking at the sea of trees, but it has become a forest industrial base of the motherland. Since liberation, millions of cubic meters of timber have been harvested here and transported to all parts of the country. If the timber harvested in 1957 is used to make sleepers, it can pave more than 4,700 kilometers of railway.

In this forest area, there are now 40,000 forestry workers and 60,000 residents. Cities have appeared in the deep mountains and dense forests, and more than 300 kilometers of forest railways have been built. It is estimated that in the second five-year plan, the population here will increase to 350,000, and 20 forest towns with about 10,000 people each will be formed. With the expansion of the forest industry, the timber processing, resin extraction, and paper industries will also gradually develop.

Developing transportation is extremely important for the economic and cultural construction of minority areas. In the past five years, the mileage of highways open to traffic in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has increased from 2,947 kilometers to 8,011 kilometers. Since the founding of New China, the state has built the Jining-Erlian Railway and more than 300 kilometers of forest railways in Inner Mongolia. The Baotou-Baiyunebo Road and the Baotou-Shiguai Road, which lead from Baotou to the mining areas, have been basically completed. The Baolan Railway, which runs through North China and Northwest China, is also under construction. The several railways that have been completed are more than 800 kilometers long, about the same distance as from Xuzhou to Xi'an on the Longhai Line. The construction of the Jining-Erlian Railway has increased the population of Jining City from 40,000 to 80,000, and many new buildings have appeared in the city, greatly changing the face of this city. Only one year after the opening of the Jining-Erlian Railway, a series of towns such as Erlian, Saihantala, and Tumuerte have appeared on the grasslands along the line. Before the railway was built, herders in the Saihantala area had no way to build a few earthen houses, but now there are thousands of brick and tile houses, gathering 3,000 people, becoming a bustling town where herders can buy all kinds of supplies they need in the shops here.

Railways connect factories, mines, rural areas, grasslands, and forests, forming new economic centers in many places, and many constructions are concentrated to form new cities.

The construction of modern industry and the development of transportation are changing the face of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, living in the big family of the motherland, are welcoming their new life with infinite excitement and intense labor.

    内蒙古的工业建设
    本报记者　林沫
    说到内蒙古自治区的工业建设，不能不先谈谈这里各族人民对工业化的心愿。这使我想起一件事情。前年冬季的一天，我到扎鲁特旗去采访。夜晚，同旗委农牧部部长格格木德同志一起围炉闲谈。扎鲁特旗，在内蒙古来说算是一个偏僻的不大引人注意的地方，过去因为交通不便，外边很少有人到这地方来。但它也像内蒙古的其他地方一样，只要到那里去了，你就会认识到那辽阔的土地和丰富的资源。这个旗的面积长八百里，宽二百五十里，人口只有五万多。格格木德说：“我们这里有的是大片的牧场，可以牧养肥牛胖马和羊群。荒地，一眼望不到边，多肥呵！北山后的地三、四尺深都是黑土。利用山沟的流水可以种稻子，一垧地能打几十石。山里头，更是用不完的柴草。有些外地的农民到我们这地方来，说这地方遍地金子，都快要埋到人的脖子上了！我们这里可真有金矿，还有大煤田，还出石墨。说到地下的宝贝，真不知有多少哩！”
    格格木德越谈越起劲。那通红的炉火，映照着他那付发光的面孔。
      “你看，这煤！”他像发现珍宝似的，从炉子旁边拣起一块煤炭放到我手里。这煤硬的像石头一样，烧起来火力很强，装上一炉子，一天也不熄。
      “你知道这煤出在什么地方吗？——就离这儿不远。最近有地质工作人员来看过，初步勘查的结果，说有三十里长、二十里宽的一块地方，地下全是这种煤，一层就有三、四公尺厚。他们已经把样品带走化验去了。如果能作为工业用煤，国家就可能大规模开采。那实在太好，实在太好了！”
      “实在太好了！”这话在他说来，有两方面的意义：一来是，在自己民族生存的这块土地上，地下丰富的宝藏被埋没了千万年，过去一直没有人去理睬。现在被发掘出来，可以贡献于国家的工业建设，成为全国人民可贵的财富，他因此感到极大的光荣。同时，在自己的家乡建立了矿山和工厂，人民的经济文化生活就会发生绝大的变化。鲁北（旗机关所在地）这个地方，就不再是一个冷落的小镇，而会变成一个繁荣多采的城市了。
    有许多人就像格格木德这样，对工业化抱着热切的愿望。在一些盟、旗工作人员的办公桌上，往往陈放着当地出产的矿藏，有的被装置在精致的玻璃盒里，裹衬着彩色的绸缎。这些大都是国家派到这个地区的勘探队，以报喜的方式送给当地人民的礼物。这些礼物，就成了这块土地的光荣标志，成了当地人民心目中美好的希望和传说的佳话。
    在内蒙古自治区这块等待开发的处女地上，近年来曾有几十个勘探队在进行活动。他们找到了大量的煤、铁，某些稀有金属和有色金属。而更多的宝藏还等待着这些探寻者去发现。
    曾经有一个叫波尔勃的蒙古族工人，参加了勘探队的工作。每逢遇到家乡的人们，问他在那里工作，他就笑眯眯地回答说：“我在工业化里工作，工业化里有我们美好的生活！”在波尔勃看来，工业化就像神话故事中的“宝盒”一样，那里面有着和平幸福生活所需要的一切。
    而这个“宝盒”已经不是神话的传说和人们的希望，新中国成立以后，已经有大小三百多个厂矿企业出现在内蒙古自治区的土地上和各族人民的生活中了！
    内蒙古是一个畜牧业十分发达的地区，有大量的畜产品可作为轻工业的原料。自治区现有两个肉类联合加工厂、一个毛织厂、两个较大的皮革厂和三个较大的乳品厂。这些工厂大部分都是机械化的，能够大规模进行生产。海拉尔肉类联合加工厂每天可以处理几百头牛或上千只的羊。
    内蒙古西部包头一带还是一个很好的甜菜产地，甜菜的含糖量比国内许多地方都要高。这里已经建成一座现代化的包头糖厂，每天能生产一百四十多吨草原牌的白沙糖。根据远景规划，在包头、呼和浩特一带，将建立几个现代化的大糖厂，成为我国北方的一个糖业基地。
    现在，内蒙古自治区的各族人民，能够吃到区内工厂出产的食糖、肉类、奶粉和奶油，可以穿到当地制成的毛织品和皮革制品。这些产品还供应国内各地，有的还可以出口到国外去。
    为农牧业生产服务的中小型机械制造业，近几年有了很快的发展。这类工厂全区有几十个，大量生产为农民所需要的新式农具、水车、锅驼机和牧民所用的打草机、剪毛机和奶油分离机。
    解放以前的内蒙古，能够勉强称为近代工业的只是几处破旧的发电厂和一所毛织厂。现在自治区的工业技术力量和生产能力是十倍、百倍地增加了。
    更为各族人民所倾心注目的是，国家在内蒙古地区开始了重工业的建设。在内蒙古西部地区，有一个地方叫白云鄂博，翻译成汉话就叫富山，原来这是一座铁山。铁矿的埋藏量之多和矿石含铁比例之高，在世界上都是稀有的。由于这个大铁矿的发现，包头地区正在兴建我国一个巨大的钢铁工业基地。大家知道，长春第一汽车制造厂的建成，曾引起了全国人民的注意。包头工业基地的建设，以几个主要厂矿来说，它的规模比长春汽车厂大得多。而它的作用，则是无法比拟的。包头钢铁联合企业的建设，对祖国的工业化有重大作用，同时也将根本改变内蒙古自治区的落后面貌。
    包头市原只有十四万人，是一个缺乏现代工业基础的中小城市，而在钢铁工业建成之后，它将成为一个近百万人口的大工业城市。到那时，包头将是烟囱林立，钢水奔流，汽车、火车来往如梭，科学技术将有很大的发展，它将是十分繁荣而又有着巨大生产力量的社会主义的新城市。
    在包头的新市区，两年前还是一片荒滩野地，如今在几十里地的范围内展开了大规模的建设活动，出现了一片片的楼房瓦屋，从全国各地来了十五万人——工业基地的建设者和他们的家属，在这里开始了一个新的工业城市的建设。
    包头市大工业的建设，也带动了地方工业迅速的发展。1952年全市有十九个中小工厂，生产工人约一千人，到1956年，工厂增加到四十二个，生产工人和年产值都扩大了十倍以上。
    在内蒙古自治区的东部，有我国最大的林区大兴安岭。这是一个绿色的海洋，在绵延千里的山岗上，长着密密的落叶松和白桦树，每一平方公里内大约有十六万棵。用这些珍贵的木材，将可供多少个城市的建筑用材和铺修多少万公里的铁路所需要的枕木呵！是由于它的巨大财富呢？还是因为森林使土地更加美丽和多采呢？当地人民一直亲昵地叫它“金的兴安岭”。在蒙古民歌中，人们曾经如此热情地歌唱着它：
        登上了兴安，金的兴安，
        高山上眺望噢，
        好像望见了父亲的故乡，
        蒙古真族哟！
    大兴安岭，现在不单是人们望着树海歌唱的地方了，它成了祖国的一个森林工业基地。解放以后，从这里采伐了数百万立方公尺的木材，运往祖国各地。如果用1957年采伐的木材作成枕木，就可以铺四千七百多公里的铁路。
    在这个林区，现在有四万林业职工和六万居民。在深山密林中，出现了城市，修筑了三百多公里的森林铁路。预计在第二个五年计划内，这里的人口将增加到三十五万，并形成二十个万人左右的林区市镇。随着森林工业的扩大，制材、浸膏和造纸工业也将逐步地发展起来。
    发展交通运输事业，对少数民族地区的经济文化建设有极重要的作用。最近五年来，内蒙古自治区的公路通车里程由二千九百四十七公里发展到八千零十一公里。新中国成立以后，国家在内蒙古修建了集二铁路和三百多公里的森林铁路。从包头通往矿区的包白路和包石路已基本建成。贯通华北和西北的包兰路也正在动工兴建。已修成的几条铁路总长八百多公里，约等于陇海线上的徐州到西安那么远。集二路的修建，使集宁市的人口由四万增加到八万，市内出现了许多新的建筑，大大改变了这个城市的面貌。集二路通车不过一年，在沿线的草原上已经出现了二连、赛汗塔拉、土木尔台等一连串的市镇。未修铁路以前，赛汗塔拉一带的牧民，要想盖几间土房都没办法，而现在这里出现了上千间的砖瓦房，聚集了三千人口，成为一个热闹的市镇，牧民可以在这儿的商店里买到他们所需要的各种用品。
    铁路联结着工厂、矿山、农村、草原和森林，在许多地方形成新的经济中心，许多建设集中起来构成新的城市。
    现代工业的建设和交通运输事业的发展，正在改变着内蒙古自治区的面貌。生活在祖国大家庭中的内蒙古自治区的各族人民，正以无限兴奋的心情和紧张的劳动来迎接自己的新生活。（附图片）
