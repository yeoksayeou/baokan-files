Academic Activities in Hunan Province are Very Active

    (Our report) Academic circles in Hunan Province have been unprecedentedly active in the past year. Twenty-five specialized societies in natural sciences held more than 30 important or large-scale academic activities, 133 special report meetings and experience exchange meetings, and scientific workers presented more than 100 academic papers and reports. Through these activities, the scientific research work in Hunan Province has been further promoted, the unity among scientific workers has been strengthened, and some technical problems in production have also been solved for business departments.
    Various sub-disciplines of the Changsha Branch of the Chinese Medical Association, in conjunction with the activities of relevant teaching and research groups of Hunan Medical College, regularly study the world's latest medical achievements and hold special reports. Units such as the Physics Society, Chemistry Society, Botany Society, and Geography Society have organized regular special reports, experience exchanges, and academic discussion meetings among teachers in secondary schools. At the inaugural meeting of the Changsha Branch of the Geological Society of China held in September 1956, seven papers were read, including "Some Views on the Geological Characteristics of Non-ferrous Metals in the Four Provinces of Central and Southern China and Their Prospecting Significance" and "Some Preliminary Opinions on the Yaogangxian Igneous Rocks."
    The Changsha Branch of the Chinese Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Society has also organized many activities and published "Branch Communications." In order to eliminate livestock diseases, members were organized to carry out scientific research on "White Scours of Piglets," "Swine Fever Attenuated Virus Safe Immunization Test," and "Ningxiang Pig Performance Survey." Soviet experts in Changsha City were also invited to give a special report on "Swine Pox." The Changsha Branch of the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association helped the Provincial Department of Health and other units jointly organize a survey team of Traditional Chinese Medicine, focusing on the production of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Pingjiang and Shaodong counties, which played a significant role in the identification of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Hunan Province.
    While carrying out scientific research, specialized societies also launched free academic discussions. In mid-December 1956, the Changsha Branch of the Chinese Physical Society held a discussion on "Some Basic Issues Related to Thermodynamics"; the Changsha Branch of the Geological Society of China also held three discussion meetings on "Basic Issues of Geotectonics" and "Opinions on the Division of China's Geotectonic Regions."

    湖南省学术活动很活跃
    本报讯　湖南省学术界去年一年来空前活跃。自然科学方面的二十五个专门学会举行了比较重要或大型的学术活动达三十多次，专题报告会和经验交流会一百三十三次，科学工作者提出的学术论文和报告在百篇以上。通过这些活动，进一步推动了湖南省的科学研究工作，加强了科学工作者之间的团结，也帮助了业务部门解决了一些生产上的技术问题。
    中华医学会长沙分会的各个分科学会，结合湖南医学院有关教研组的活动，经常进行世界上最新医学成就的学习，并举行专题报告。物理学会、化学会、植物学会和地理学会等单位，都分别在中等学校教师中组织了定期的专题报告、经验交流及学术讨论会。中国地质学会长沙分会在1956年9月举行的成立大会上，就宣读了“关于中南四省有色金属地质特征及其找矿意义的一些见解”和“对瑶岗仙火成岩的几点初步意见”等七篇论文。
    中国畜牧兽医学会长沙分会也组织了不少的活动，出版了“分会通讯”。为了消灭牲畜的疾病，组织会员进行了“仔猪白痢病”、“猪瘟弱毒安全免疫试验”和“宁乡猪性能调查”等科学研究，还邀请在长沙市的苏联专家作了“猪痘”的专题报告。中国药学会长沙分会帮助省卫生厅等单位联合组织的中药调查组，重点整理了平江、邵东两县的中药生产情况，对湖南省中药的鉴定起了很大的作用。
    在开展科学研究工作的同时，各专门学会还展开了学术上的自由讨论。1956年12月中旬，中国物理学会长沙分会举行了一次“有关热力学的一些基本问题”的讨论；中国地质学会长沙分会也曾举行过三次“大地构造基本问题”和“中国大地构造分区意见”的讨论会。
