Party Members' Marital Issues Do Not Need Party Organization Approval
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

The article "Why Did They Commit Suicide by Drowning?" published in this newspaper revealed the detailed circumstances of the Second Engineering Company Party Committee of the Sichuan Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau excessively interfering in party members' marriages, causing serious adverse consequences. This incident raises a general principle question for us – do party members' marriages (including marriage and divorce) need to be approved by the party organization?

It should be clarified that our party has never uniformly stipulated that party members' marriages and divorces must be approved by the party organization. There is no such provision in the party's discipline. Only local party organizations have some regulations based on actual circumstances. However, these were already canceled after 1949. But even now, this "approval" system is still maintained in many party organizations. According to the People's Railway News, the party organization of the Baolan Engineering Office of the Sixth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways stipulates: all marriages of party members must go through individual application, branch discussion, general branch review, and approval by the office party committee. Other places have similar regulations.

During the period when domestic political struggles were very sharp and complex, it was originally necessary and correct for Communist Party members, who bore significant political missions, to ask the party organization to help them understand the political background of their chosen marriage partners, in order to avoid being deceived politically. The party organization would not regard this kind of help as a power, and party members would not feel that this kind of help was a restriction on them. Is this kind of help and concern from the party organization still needed now? It should be said that as long as the political struggle between revolution and counter-revolution does not end, this kind of help and care should not stop.

On the other hand, because marriage is a lifelong event for party members, just as it is for the masses, handling it well is very helpful to their careers; handling it poorly will have a negative impact on their careers. Therefore, in addition to political background considerations, party members often want to seek the opinions of the party organization on other aspects that need to be considered. In this case, it is entirely appropriate and necessary for the party organization to help party members understand all aspects of the other party, their strengths and weaknesses, and help party members consider the advantages and disadvantages. In the past, many party organizations did this, and it should be considered that it mainly had a good effect and cannot be considered as interfering with party members' freedom of marriage.

However, due to some party organizations and party members not understanding or not fully understanding this meaning, the result has gradually turned the party organization's help and concern for party members into unnecessary and excessive interference, turning it into a serious issue of "approval" and "disapproval." In some places, the party organization has even replaced the judicial organs. As a result, various deviations have emerged.

The investigation of political background was originally said to be about the person's own current counter-revolutionary issues, but now it has been infinitely expanded. The so-called people with "political problems" often do not only refer to counter-revolutionaries or those with major counter-revolutionary suspicions, but also include people with relatively complex general social relations and those with some minor stains on their personal history. If a relative of the party member's marriage partner has engaged in counter-revolution, then regardless of whether this partner has any political connection with that relative, and regardless of his (or her) own ideological situation or performance at work, it will be treated as a "problem" and they will not be allowed to marry. If this marriage partner participated in the Three People's Principles Youth League or other reactionary organizations many years ago, then regardless of his (or her) motivation for participating at the time, whether there were any activities after participating, whether it has been clearly explained, how they are performing now, and what their ideological situation is, they will still not be allowed to marry. The fact that the execution of a direct relative for counter-revolution affects one's own marriage is not limited to Huang Daiyu alone, but there are many other examples. This is obviously an excessive expansion of the problem. It is certainly good if a person's social relations and personal history are absolutely clean. But many young men and women in our ranks have lived through the old society, and it is inevitable that they will have some complex social relations. Even if some of their relatives have committed crimes against the people, if they themselves and these relatives' crimes are "as different as a horse and an ox," why should they bear the consequences of these crimes and affect their marriages? As for some stains on one's personal history, if they have already been washed away by new revolutionary actions today, and their thinking has been transformed, and they can sincerely serve the people, why can't party members marry them (or her)?

Some party organizations also do not allow party members to marry people from landlord or rich peasant families. There is such an example: Guan Yiqing, a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Communist Youth League, serves as the secretary of the League branch in her unit, and falls in love with a party member, preparing to marry during the 1956 Spring Festival. However, the party organization of the other party did not approve the marriage because Guan Yiqing was from a landlord family, causing both parties great pain. This is obviously too much control. Everyone knows that cadres from landlord and rich peasant families are not impossible to reform. Today, there are many party members in our party who come from landlord and rich peasant families. But under the education of the party, they have abandoned the position and interests of their original class and are willing to devote themselves to the cause of the proletariat for the rest of their lives. They have gloriously done a lot of hard work for the party. If we are not adherents of the theory of pure class origin, why can't we ask about a person's ideological situation and only talk about their origin and class background?

Some party organizations even regard some lifestyle issues of party members' marriage partners as issues that the organization should consider. In fact, some of them cannot even be called lifestyle issues. For example, frequent contact between men and women during the process of falling in love and making friends is a completely normal phenomenon, but it is also considered "bad style" or "improper" and interfered with. After a period of friendly interaction, men and women may eventually marry, or they may eventually find that they do not get along with each other and become indifferent and even distant. This is of course also a normal phenomenon. But it is said that this is also regarded as "improper style" or "immoral" and becomes a reason for not allowing party members to marry him (or her).

There are even more absurd phenomena – the party organization comes forward to investigate whether a couple has had sexual relations, whether they are pregnant; the party organization comes forward to oppose district cadres marrying township cadres, and opposes district cadres marrying township cadres; stipulating illegal marriage and divorce "conditions," stipulating that girls in this village are not allowed to marry people from other villages; and even organizing struggle sessions to struggle against a couple, "catching adulterers," tying up and beating a couple... Anything is possible.

These facts show that, in addition to cognitive problems, some people still have strong feudal consciousness at play in their minds. They cannot correctly understand the party's policy of freedom of marriage, and they think that the party organization and party leaders can arbitrarily arrange and interfere in the marriage issues of party members and even the masses like a feudal family or feudal patriarch, can arbitrarily allow or disallow, arbitrarily approve or disapprove, arbitrarily obstruct, arbitrarily break up, and arbitrarily punish. They have turned the party organization into a privileged organization that can arbitrarily violate national laws and infringe upon personal freedom and other civil rights. In the extreme, they have turned "parents' orders and matchmakers' words" into "the party organization's orders and the party organization's words," just changing the form. As long as the party organization says "no," the party member cannot marry. The suicides of Gong Bingzhang and Huang Daiyu are certainly the result of their own lack of understanding of national laws, the legal system, and an unclear revolutionary outlook on life; however, the company party organization's excessive power and excessive interference cannot but be considered the direct cause of this unfortunate incident. This interference caused two young people who could have served the revolution well to commit suicide.

We believe that the party organization should educate its members to abide by the Marriage Law and establish communist marriage and family moral concepts, but it should never turn the obligation of education into legal power! Party members' marriage and divorce must be decided by the man and woman themselves. The party organization should not and does not need to have the power of "approval" or "disapproval" over party members' marriage issues. If the party organization knows that a party member's marriage partner has certain shortcomings or problems, it can remind the party member to pay attention and ask him to consider it. Whether a party member's marriage and divorce comply with the Marriage Law should be decided by the government and judicial organs. The party organization has no right to decide, nor does it need to decide!

### 党员的婚姻问题不必经党组织批准

    党员的婚姻问题不必经党组织批准
    本报评论员
    本报发表的“他们到底为什么投河自杀”一文，揭露了四川省建筑工程局第二工程公司党委会过多地干涉党员婚姻，造成严重恶果的详细情形。这一事件向我们提出一个一般的原则问题——党员的婚姻（包括结婚和离婚）究竟要不要经党组织批准？
    应当说明，我们党从来没有统一规定过党员结婚、离婚要经党组织批准。党的纪律中并没有这一条。只是各地党组织根据实际情形的需要，有一些规定。但在1949年以后已经取消了。可是一直到现在，这种“批准”制度还在许多党组织中保持着。据人民铁道报载，铁道部第六工程局宝兰工程处党组织就这样规定：凡是党员结婚，必须经过个人申请，支部讨论，总支审查，处党委批准。另外有些地方也有类似的规定。
    在国内政治斗争十分尖锐复杂的时期，担负着重大政治使命的共产党员，在自己选择结婚对象的时候，要求党组织帮助自己了解一下对方的政治面目，以免在政治上上当吃亏，这本来是必要的和正确的，党组织不会把这种帮助看成一种权力，党员也不会感到这种帮助对自己是一种限制。党组织对党员的这种帮助现在是不是仍然需要呢？应当说，革命同反革命的政治斗争一日不终止，这种帮助和关怀也就不应当停止。
    另一方面，由于婚姻问题对于党员来说也同对于群众一样，是一件终身大事。处理得好，对事业很有帮助；处理得不好，就会对事业发生不好的影响。所以除了政治面目的考虑之外，其他方面所需要考虑的问题，党员也时常愿意征求党组织的意见。在这种情况下，党组织很好地帮助党员了解一下对方的各方面情况，各方面的优点和缺点，帮助党员考虑一下利弊，也是完全应该的和必要的。过去许多党组织这样作了，应当认为主要方面还是发生了良好的作用，不能认为这是干涉党员的婚姻自由。
    但是，由于若干党的组织和党员不了解或者不完全了解这种意义，结果就在执行中逐渐把党组织对党员的帮助和关怀变成了不必要的、过多的干涉，变成了“批准”和“不批准”的严重问题。有的地方甚至是党组织代替了司法机关。发展的结果，出现了各式各样的偏向。
    政治面目的考察，本来是说本人的、现行的反革命的问题，现在却被无限地扩大化了。所谓有“政治问题”的人，往往不只是指反革命分子或有重大反革命嫌疑的分子，而是包括了一般的社会关系比较复杂，和本人历史上有过一些小污点的人。党员结婚对象的亲属中有人干过反革命，那就不管这个对象和那个亲属是否有政治上的联系，也不管他（或她）本人思想状况如何，工作中表现如何，反正要当作“问题”，不许结婚。如果这个结婚对象曾经在多少年以前参加过三青团或其他反动组织，那就不问他（或她）当时参加的动机如何，参加后有没有什么活动，是否已经交代清楚，现在表现怎样，思想状况怎样，同样不许结婚。因为直系亲属反革命被处死而影响到本人婚姻的，并不止黄代玉一人，还有不少其他例子。这显然是把问题过分地扩大化了。一个人的社会关系和个人的历史绝对清白，当然很好。但是我们队伍中有许多青年男女都是从旧社会生活过来的，难免要有些复杂的社会关系。他们（或她们）的亲属当中尽管有人对人民有过罪恶，可是他们本人和这些亲属的罪恶如果“风马牛不相及”，为什么要他们担负这种罪恶的后果，影响到他们的婚姻呢？至于本人在历史上有过一些污点，如果今天已经用新的革命行为洗刷了，思想已经转变了，能够诚诚恳恳地为人民服务，党员为什么不能和他们（或她们）结婚呢？
    还有些党的组织不让党员和地主、富农家庭出身的人们结婚。有这样一个例子：浙江省青年团员关一清，担任她所在单位的团支部书记，和一个党员发生恋爱，准备1956年春节结婚，但是，对方所在的党组织因为关一清是地主家庭出身，就不批准那个党员和她结婚，弄得双方都很痛苦。这显然也是管得太多了。大家都知道，地主、富农家庭出身的干部，并不是不可以改造的。今天我们党内就有不少党员出身于地主、富农家庭。但是在党的教育下，他们放弃了原阶级的立场和利益，愿意终身为无产阶级的事业奋斗，他们光荣地为党作了大量的艰苦的工作。我们如果不是唯成份论者，为什么可以不问本人思想状况而专谈出身和成份呢？
    还有些党的组织甚至把党员结婚对象的一些生活作风问题也当成了组织应当考虑的问题。而事实上有些是连生活作风问题也说不上的。比如恋爱过程和交友过程中男女双方接触频繁，这本来是完全正常的现象，但也被认为是“作风不好”、“不正派”，而加以干涉。男女双方经过若干时间的友好相处，最后可能结婚，也可能最后发现自己与对方合不来，因而转趋冷淡，以至远离，这当然也是正常现象。但是据说这也被当成“作风不正派”或“不道德”，成为不许党员与他（或她）结婚的理由。
    还有更荒谬的现象——党组织出面追查某对恋人发生肉体关系了没有，怀孕了没有；党组织出面反对区干部嫁乡干部，反对区干部娶乡干部；规定非法的结婚、离婚“条件”，规定本村姑娘不许嫁外村人；甚至组织斗争会来斗争一对恋人，“捉奸”，捆绑和打骂一对恋人……无奇不有。
    这些事实说明，除了认识上的问题以外，还有些人脑子里还有浓厚的封建意识在作怪。他们不能正确地理解党的婚姻自由政策，以为党组织和党的领导人可以像一个封建家族或封建家长一样随意包办和干涉党员以至群众的婚姻问题，可以随意允许或不允许，随意批准或不批准，随意阻挠，随意拆散，随意惩罚。他们把党组织变成了特权组织，可以随便违犯国家的法律，侵犯人身自由和其他公民权利。发展到极端，就是把“父母之命、媒妁之言”，变成了“党组织之命和党组织之言”，换个形式而已。只要党组织说声“不准”，党员就不能结婚。龚炳章和黄代玉的自杀，固然是他们自己不了解国家法律、法制和革命人生观不够明确的结果；但是公司党组织的这种过大的权力和过多的干涉不能不认为是这一不幸事件的直接原因。这种干涉使一对本来可以好好为革命服务的青年自杀了。
    我们认为：党组织教育自己的党员遵守婚姻法，树立共产主义的婚姻和家庭道德观念，但是决不应当把教育的义务变成法律性的权力！党员的结婚、离婚，必须由男女双方自己决定。党组织对党员的婚姻问题不应当也不需要有“批准”和“不批准”的权力。党组织如果知道一个党员的结婚对象有某些缺点或问题，可以提醒党员注意，请他考虑。党员结婚和离婚是否合于婚姻法，应当由政府和司法机关决定。党组织无权决定，也无须决定！
