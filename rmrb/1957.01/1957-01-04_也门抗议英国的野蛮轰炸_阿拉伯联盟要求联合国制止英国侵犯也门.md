    也门抗议英国的野蛮轰炸
    阿拉伯联盟要求联合国制止英国侵犯也门
    新华社3日讯　伦敦消息：也门驻英国代办穆罕默德·易卜拉欣2日发表声明，抗议英国军用飞机12月31日轰炸也门哈里布城附近地区。
    也门驻英国公使馆在这篇声明中说：“1956年12月31日早晨，两架英国军用飞机飞临也门哈里布城和这个城市附近的村庄投掷了许多炸弹，结果这个城市附近村庄里的几所房子起了火。”声明说：“也门驻英国代办穆罕默德·易卜拉欣2日上午已经就这种侵略行为向（英国）外交部提出抗议，并且要求外交部制止这种侵略和遵守两国之间签订的协定。”
    也门驻埃及公使阿布塔莱布同一天在开罗说，英国军队已经利用英国的亚丁保护地在也门边境进行集结，这就“引起了也门的非常紧急的局势”。阿布塔莱布指出，也门、埃及和沙特阿拉伯政府现在正根据它们签订的三边军事协定来研究这一局势。他并且说，亚丁和也门之间的电话联系已经被切断了。
    阿布塔莱布还说，他已经把这些局势发展的情况告诉了苏联驻埃及大使兼驻也门的公使基谢廖夫以及埃及和阿拉伯联盟的官员们。
    据路透社纽约消息说，也门驻联合国代表团2日向联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德提出了对英国的控诉。也门在控诉中指出英国应该对在也门南部边界发动大规模的攻击一事负责，并且要求哈马舍尔德进行斡旋，以结束英国对也门的侵略。也门驻联合国代表团还要求把它的控诉书分发给联合国所有的会员国。
    新华社3日讯　开罗消息：阿拉伯联盟2日晚间发表声明，对于英国侵犯也门的局势表示关切。声明要求联合国干预以维护正义。
