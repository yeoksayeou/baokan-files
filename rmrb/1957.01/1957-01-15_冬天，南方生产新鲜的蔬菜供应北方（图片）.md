    In winter, the South produces fresh vegetables to supply the North
    Before the Spring Festival, the land in northern China is already covered with a thick layer of white snow, but in the fields of Guangdong Province in the South, it is still lush and green. Guangdong vegetable farmers are busy producing various vegetables to supply the people in northern cities, industrial and mining areas for the winter and the festival. Yangji Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Guangzhou planted more than 350 mu of cabbage. The average yield per mu in this season reached 55 dan. The members are preparing to sell the harvested cabbage to the East District Vegetable Management Department of Guangzhou City for transportation to the North.

    冬天，南方生产新鲜的蔬菜供应北方
    春节前，祖国北方的大地已经盖上了一层厚厚的白雪，南方广东省的田野上，还是片片葱绿。广东菜农正忙着生产各种蔬菜供应北方各城市、工矿区人们过冬过节。广州市郊杨箕农业生产合作社种了三百五十多亩洋白菜，这一季每亩产量平均达到五十五担。社员们正准备把收摘的洋白菜卖给广州市东区蔬菜管理部运往北方。
