Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 15th: "People's Will" published an article commenting on Hungary's economic prospects for this year based on the achievements of the first ten days of the year.

    The newspaper said: Compared with the situation fifteen days ago, the prospects currently presented are much better. Coal miners reached 60% of the average output in January of last year on January 10th. Thus, it can be expected that Hungarian industrial production will reach approximately 60% of the average output of the first nine months of last year in February. Based on this estimate, industrial production in the fourth quarter will reach the projected production level of last year. However, from now until the end of the year, we will produce 10 billion forints worth of products less than the planned output for last year. If we add the losses since October 23 last year, each resident will lose 2,500 forints.

    When discussing the unemployment problem, the newspaper pointed out that the number of unemployed in the industrial sector will be clearly less than expected. If coal production increases as expected, the total number of workers in March will reach 85% of last year's total number of workers, and in April will reach 90%. In the industrial sector, the unemployment problem will be virtually resolved in the fourth quarter. However, the layoffs from administrative organs still need to be addressed.

    匈“人民意志报”评述今年经济前景
    工业生产情况逐步好转
    新华社16日讯　据匈牙利通讯社布达佩斯15日讯：“人民意志报”刊载了一篇文章，就今年年初十天的成就评述今年匈牙利经济的前景。　
    这家报纸说：同十五天以前的情况相比，目前展示的前景要好得多。煤矿工人在1月10日达到了去年1月间平均产量的60％。这样，就可以预期：匈牙利工业生产在2月间大约将达到去年头九个月的平均产量的60％。根据这种预计，工业生产在第四季度将达到去年的预计生产水平。但是从现在起到年底止，我们将比去年计划规定的产量少生产价值一百亿福林的产品。如果再加上去年10月23日以来的损失，每一个居民就损失了两千五百福林。
    报纸在谈到失业问题时指出，在工业部门中失业人数将显然比预计的要少。如果煤产量像预计的那样提高，工人总数在3月间将达到去年工人总数的85％，在4月间将达到90％。在工业部门中，失业问题将在第四季度实际上得到解决。但是，行政机关的解雇人员尚待寻求解决办法。
