    Xinhua News Agency, 25th - According to the Hungarian News Agency, the Budapest Police Department recently arrested a group of counter-revolutionaries. The ringleader of this gang, Gábor Föly, was a key member of the counter-revolutionary group "Guards" before liberation. In 1946, he was sentenced to ten years in prison for conspiring to endanger the state, and was paroled in 1955. During the events of October and November, he participated in the armed rebellion. After the failure of the counter-revolution, he continued to carry out counter-revolutionary activities by compiling and distributing various reactionary leaflets and privately storing weapons and ammunition. The aim of the Föly group was to organize young people against the people's regime. Föly confessed that he had attempted to become the commander of the Budapest Military District and had even lured two primary school students to collect information about the Hungarian armed forces. Thanks to the assistance of residents and the meticulous investigation by the police, this gang of bandits was finally arrested and will be brought to a special court for trial. The two children have been returned to their parents.

    布达佩斯警察局破获一反革命集团
    新华社25日讯　据匈牙利通讯社报道：布达佩斯警察局最近逮捕了一批反革命分子。这伙匪徒的头子加博尔·弗利，在解放前是反革命集团“禁卫队”的骨干。1946年，他因阴谋危害国家罪被判处十年徒刑，1955年被假释出狱。在十月、十一月事件中，他参加了武装叛乱，在反革命失败以后，他编发各种反动传单、私藏武器弹药继续进行反革命活动。弗利集团的目的是组织青年反对人民政权。弗利供认，他曾企图当布达佩斯军区司令，并且曾经诱骗过两个小学生去搜集关于匈牙利武装部队的情报。由于居民的协助和警察的周密侦察，这一帮匪徒终于被逮捕并将送交特别法庭审讯。两个孩子已经送回给他们的家长。
