Can Guanzhong Area's Wheat Increase Production Again This Year?
	The Key Lies in How People Treat Difficulties
	Shen Qiru

	Last December, the reporter visited the Guanzhong Plain in Shaanxi, one of the nation's famous wheat-producing areas. Vast stretches of green wheat fields extended as far as the eye could see. Canal water slowly irrigated the newly applied floating manure, and the wheat seedlings generally had three or four tillers. This scene inevitably led one to think: 1957 will be another year of wheat harvest.

	However, when the reporter recalled the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture's estimates of the wheat harvest, this thought had to be interrupted. According to the Department of Agriculture's analysis, there are many unfavorable factors in this year's wheat production. The planned average yield per unit area of wheat in the province cannot be increased, but will instead decrease somewhat.

	The reporter arrived at the Douma Village Agricultural Cooperative in Xingping County, one of the banners of high wheat yield in Guanzhong. The cooperative cadres here agreed with the Department of Agriculture's estimate of the difficulties in this year's wheat production: the planting area was reduced by eight hundred mu, the yield per unit area was maintained at last year's level, and the total output was reduced by sixty thousand jin.

	Such a plan has relaxed people's production enthusiasm. The fields of the Douma Agricultural Cooperative are quiet. Most of the young men and three-quarters of the production team leaders have gone to engage in sideline occupations. Only a few old men drive manure-carrying carts on the road. The village's manure accumulation work has not yet started. This situation also exists in some cooperatives near Douma Village that are preparing for reduced production. It's time for winter irrigation, but some cadres claim that "the soil moisture is still high!" It was the cadres of the Water Conservancy Bureau who mobilized some women and old men to carry out irrigation. It is said that winter irrigation is also progressing slowly in Zhouzhi, Dali, Fengxiang, and Pucheng areas.

	The Douma Cooperative's production reduction plan is only "grasped" by a few cooperative cadres and has not been announced to the members, because the members have a different idea. One production team signed a contract with the tractor station for a yield of 550 jin per mu, which is 100 jin more than the cooperative's plan. The youth team's plan for the upland slope is 70 jin higher than the cooperative's plan.

	What are the masses in other areas thinking? The reporter went to eastern Guanzhong to find the answer.

	In Weinan County, the center of eastern Guanzhong, most of the wheat fields are located on arid plateaus with a shortage of fertilizer, and winter field management work has been slow to start. The reporter visited a responsible comrade of the Rural Work Department of the Weinan County Committee of the Communist Party of China and discussed the issue of increasing wheat production this year. He said, "The possibility of increasing and decreasing wheat production both exist, and the key to the decision still lies in people. From the current point of view, although there is a shortage of fertilizer and a drought has appeared, the real difficulty is that people have become lax, especially the county leadership. This situation has now begun to reverse. People are confident in achieving our original plan to increase the yield per unit area by 11%."

	In the Hongxing Cooperative in Baiyang Township of this county, you can see the farmers' confidence and enthusiasm in striving for increased production. This is a cooperative of more than two hundred households. They have now top-dressed all the wheat fields and carried out winter hoeing and winter irrigation. Most of these tasks were completed in the recent "Ten-Day Red Flag Competition" launched by the cooperative. Before that, the management of the wheat fields here was very lax. The county party committee's work team helped solve specific problems and strengthened ideological education, which reversed the situation. At present, the wheat production target proposed by this cooperative has been raised from 310 jin per mu last year to 400 jin. Similar situations are quite common in Weinan.

	On the way to Wugong, a neighboring county of Xingping, some comrades from the Wugong Agricultural Technology Extension Station were encountered. They had just returned from investigating the wheat growth situation in the county. They believe that the 1957 harvest is very promising. There are now generally 250,000 to 300,000 tillers per mu in the county's wheat fields. Even if discounted by 20%, it can grow into 200,000 to 240,000 ears of wheat. During the summer harvest forecast in 1956, there were generally only 180,000 ears per mu, and the yield forecast was more than 380 jin. If the winter wheat field management is normal, the wheat yield may exceed 400 jin. They said that this is because the quality of sowing has been improved compared to the past under the conditions of cooperativization. For example, the area where row planting is implemented has increased from 20% in the previous year to 80%. The amount of seeds sown per mu is generally two to three jin more. The area where basal fertilizer is applied has increased from 20% to 50%. Other links such as land preparation and seed mixing have also been strengthened.

	According to the investigation, the above situation is not isolated in Guanzhong. The area of wheat fields with basal fertilizer applied has reached about 50% in more than ten counties including Chang'an, Tongguan, Fuping, Dali, and Shangnan, and the most has reached 90%. The amount of sowing is generally increased by two to four jin per mu. The area of row planting has reached more than 80% in Xunyi, Shangnan, and Huaxian. These are all unprecedented events in the history of the Guanzhong Plain. These are all good conditions for a bumper wheat harvest this year.

	Of course, there are difficulties. According to Comrade Liu Xinhuai, Secretary of the Wugong County Party Committee, the fertilizer problem in Wugong County is also very large. According to statistics at the beginning of November last year, the fertilizer stored in rural areas was 500,000 large carts, but applying top dressing to the county's wheat fields once alone requires 2 million large carts. To reach this figure, each laborer in the county needs to accumulate an average of 21 large carts of fertilizer. This is not impossible. After the manure accumulation campaign was launched in the county in mid-November last year, more than 400,000 large carts of fertilizer have been accumulated in more than forty days.

	The threat of drought is not serious in Wugong, but drought resistance work is also being carried out intensely. 60% of the irrigable wheat fields have been winter irrigated. Reconnaissance has been carried out in areas where wells can be opened. It is estimated that the small canals and wells that have been completed and are planned to be completed in winter can expand the irrigated area by more than 20,000 mu.

	Xu Bingxin, director of the Che Mengwang Village Agricultural Cooperative in Wugong County, led the reporter to visit their wheat fields. The wheat seedlings are growing densely and evenly, and the most tillers already have five or six. Large carts and handcarts are rumbling back and forth transporting manure and soil. Here, it is truly a vibrant scene. Xu Bingxin said that the cooperative's wheat production plan for this year is 540 jin per mu, which is a 40% increase compared to last year. 100% of the wheat was applied with basal fertilizer at the time of sowing, and every mu of the replanted land was plowed. Close row planting accounts for 90%. Now seven large carts of top dressing have been applied per mu, and another seven large carts are planned to be applied after winter irrigation, and some more fertilizer will be top-dressed around Qingming.

	The labor and animal power of this cooperative are also not abundant. One laborer has to cover seven or eight mu of land, and one animal has to bear more than twenty mu, which is considered an average level in Xingping and Wugong. However, because the labor force is well organized and labor efficiency has been improved, autumn harvesting, autumn planting, and autumn plowing were all completed in thirty days.

	From the above many facts, it seems that striving for increased wheat production in the Guanzhong area this year, although there are many difficulties, reduced production is not inevitable. Whether production can be increased depends on how to deal with the difficulties.

	In Xi'an, although some people are worried about the threat of drought to wheat, tens of thousands of waterwheels that have already been manufactured are still piled up there. Although some people have also considered the lack of fertilizer, in addition to instructing the counties to "adapt measures to local conditions" to find solutions, there is still a lack of more active action. This cannot but make people wonder, are these comrades going to lead the masses to overcome difficulties? Or are they going to let difficulties conquer themselves? A responsible comrade of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China once told the reporter: "The enthusiasm in the agricultural production movement last spring should be affirmed. But now some comrades only see some difficulties in their work and dare not move forward. This is not a realistic spirit." After the reporter visited the Guanzhong wheat-producing area, he realized the correctness of this opinion even more. (Xinhua News Agency Special Manuscript)

    关中地区的小麦今年能不能再增产？
    关键在于人们怎样对待困难
    沈其如
    去年12月间，记者访问了全国著名的产麦区之一的陕西关中平原。大片大片绿油油的麦田望不到边，渠水在缓缓地浸润着新盖的浮粪，麦苗一般已有三、四个分蘖了。这种景象使人不能不想到：1957年又是个小麦丰收年。
    但是，当记者想起陕西省农业厅对小麦收成的估计的时候，这种想法却不能不中断了。据农业厅分析，今年小麦生产有许多不利的因素。全省小麦计划的平均单位面积产量不能提高，反要降低一些。
    记者到了关中小麦丰产旗帜之一的兴平县豆马村农业合作社。这里社干部对今年小麦生产中困难的估计和农业厅一致，播种面积缩小八百亩，单位产量保持去年水平，总产量减少六万斤。
    这样的计划使得人们的生产情绪松弛了。豆马农业社的田野是静悄悄的，大部分年轻小伙子和四分之三的生产大队长都搞副业去了，大路上只有几个老汉吆着送粪的车子经过。村里的积肥工作还没有动静。这种情况在豆马村附近一些作减产准备的社里也同样存在着。要冬灌了，有些干部推说“地墒还大着呢！”还是水利局的干部去把一些妇女、老汉动员了出来，才进行了灌溉。听说，盩厔、大荔、凤翔、蒲城一带冬灌工作也进行得很慢。
    豆马社的减产计划还只是由几个社干部“掌握”着，没有向社员宣布，因为社员的想法是另一个样。有一个生产队和拖拉机站订合同是亩产五百五十斤，比社里的计划要多一百斤。青年队的塬坡地计划比社里的计划高七十斤。
    其他地区的群众是怎样想的呢？记者向关中东部走去，想寻找这个答案。
    在关中东部中心的渭南县，大部分麦田处在旱塬上，肥料缺乏，冬季田间管理工作开展得很迟缓。记者访问了中共渭南县委农村工作部的一位负责同志，谈到了今年小麦的增产问题。他说，“小麦增产和减产的可能性都存在，而决定的关键还在于人。从现在来看，虽然肥料不足，旱象已经出现，但真正的困难是人们出现了松懈情绪，首先是县领导上的松懈。这种情况现在已经开始扭转，我们原订的单位面积增产11％的计划，人们是有信心实现的。”
    在这个县的白杨乡红星社里，你可以看到农民们争取增产的信心和热情。这是一个二百多户的社。他们现在已经给全部麦田追了肥，进行了冬锄和冬灌。这些工作大部分是这个社在最近发动的“十日红旗竞赛”中完成的。在这以前，这里的麦田管理还是非常松懈的。县委工作组帮助解决具体问题，加强思想教育，才扭转了局面。目前，这个社提出的小麦生产指标已由去年亩产三百一十斤提高到四百斤。类似的情况在渭南是相当普遍的。
    在去兴平的邻县武功的途中，遇到了武功农业技术推广站的一些同志。他们刚调查了全县小麦生长情况回来。他们认为，1957年的丰收是大有希望的。全县现在一般麦田每亩已有二十五万个到三十万个分蘖。打个八折，也可以长成二十万到二十四万个穗子。而1956年夏收预测的时候，每亩地一般只有十八万个穗子，产量预测是三百八十多斤。如果冬季麦田管理工作正常，小麦产量可能要超过四百斤。他们说，这是因为在合作化的条件下，播种质量比过去提高了。例如，实行条播的面积由上一年的20％增加到80％。每亩地的下种量一般多二到三斤。施基肥的面积由20％增加到50％。其他像整地、拌种这些环节也都加强了。
    根据调查，上述情况在关中不是个别的。麦田施基肥的面积在长安、潼关、富平、大荔、商南等十多个县都达到50％上下，最多的达到90％。播种量一般每亩增加了二到四斤。条播面积在栒邑、商南、华县都达到80％以上。这些都是关中平原历史上所没有过的事。这都是今年小麦丰产的好条件。
    困难当然是有的。据武功县委书记刘新怀同志谈，武功县肥料的问题也很大。根据去年11月初统计，农村积存的肥料是五十万大车，但是仅给全县麦田施一次追肥就需要二百万大车。要达到这个数字，平均全县每个劳力需要积肥二十一大车。这并不是不可能的。在全县去年11月中发动积肥运动以后，四十多天已积肥四十多万大车。
    旱象的威胁在武功还不严重，但是抗旱工作也在紧张地进行。可以灌溉的麦田60％已经进行了冬灌。可以开井的地区都已进行了勘察。已经完成和计划冬季完成的小型渠道和水井，估计可以扩大灌溉面积二万多亩。
    武功县车孟王村农业社主任许炳信带领记者参观了他们的麦田。麦苗长得又稠又齐，分蘖最多的已有五、六个。大车、手推车轰隆隆地正来往运粪土。在这里，真是一片生气勃勃的景象。许炳信说，这个社今年小麦产量计划是每亩五百四十斤，要比去年增产40％。小麦播种时百分之百施了基肥，回种地每一亩都是耕翻过了的。条播密植占到了90％。现在每亩地已经上了七大车追肥，冬灌后计划再来七大车，清明前后再追些肥。
    这个社劳、畜力也不是充裕的，一个劳力要摊七、八亩地，一个牲口要负担二十多亩，这在兴平、武功都算是中等水平。但是因为劳动力组织得好，劳动效率提高了，在三十来天中，就把秋收、秋种和秋耕都完成了。
    从上述的许多事实看来，争取关中地区今年小麦增产，困难虽然很多，但减产不是不可避免的。能否增产，关键在于如何去对待困难。
    在西安，虽然有人在焦虑着干旱对小麦的威胁，但是几万辆已经制造出来的水车却还积压在那里。虽然也有人考虑到肥料缺乏，但是除了指示各县“因地制宜”想办法以外，还缺乏更积极的行动。这就不能不使人怀疑，这些同志是要领导群众去克服困难呢？还是要让困难把自己征服呢？中共陕西省委的一位负责同志曾经对记者谈过这样的话：“去年春天农业生产运动中的积极性是应该肯定的。但是现在有些同志却只看到了工作中的一些困难，就不敢前进了。这不是实事求是的精神。”记者在访问关中小麦产区以后，更加体会到这个意见的正确性。　（新华社专稿）
