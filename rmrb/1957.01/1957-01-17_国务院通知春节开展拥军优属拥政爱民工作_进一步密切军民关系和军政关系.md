Xinhua News Agency, January 16th:

    The State Council's notice regarding conducting activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen and support the government and cherish the people around the 1957 Spring Festival is as follows:
    In the past, the "support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen" work carried out by local governments at all levels and the broad masses of the people, and the "support the government and cherish the people" work carried out in the army, played a good role in strengthening military-civilian and military-government relations. However, in recent years, due to the peaceful construction environment in the country, some regions have not paid enough attention to supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen, and some troops have not paid enough attention to supporting the government and cherishing the people. Among the demobilized construction soldiers, there are still a few who have not been settled, and there are also a few who are not at ease with their labor production and current work positions, and need to be educated. In order to further strengthen military-civilian unity, military-government unity, consolidate national defense, give play to the production enthusiasm and political zeal of the families of martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers, and promote China's socialist construction, people's committees at all levels, the broad masses of the people, and the troops throughout the country should universally carry out activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen and support the government and cherish the people around the 1957 Spring Festival.
    1. A thorough publicity and education campaign on support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen and support the government and cherish the people must be conducted. Among local staff and the broad masses of the people, focus on publicizing the great contributions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the families of martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers in the Chinese revolutionary war and in defending the socialist construction of the motherland, explaining that caring for and helping them solve difficulties is the glorious responsibility of people's governments at all levels, all staff, and the broad masses of the people. In the army, all officers and soldiers should be educated to further strengthen ties with the people, forever maintain the fine tradition of hard struggle of the people's army, abide by government policies and laws, and actively support and participate in the country's socialist construction. In the border areas and minority areas, the troops should pay special attention to uniting the local ethnic groups and respecting their customs and habits. Among the families of martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers, they should be educated and encouraged to continue to carry forward the glorious traditions of the revolution, improve their socialist ideological awareness, unite with the local masses, actively participate in production and work, and strive to make greater contributions to the country's socialist construction.
    2. A thorough inspection of the work of preferential treatment, resettlement of demobilized construction soldiers, and military-government and military-civilian relations should be conducted. People's committees at all levels and the leading organs of local troops should organize joint symposiums to inspect the work of preferential treatment, resettlement of demobilized construction soldiers, and military-government and military-civilian relations, and solicit each other's opinions. All relevant organs, organizations, enterprises, schools, and rural grassroots organizations, agricultural production cooperatives, etc., should, in accordance with the "State Council's Resolution on the Work of Resettling Demobilized Construction Soldiers" of May 1955 and the state's preferential treatment policies, focus on conducting in-depth inspections of the work of preferential treatment labor days and resettlement of demobilized soldiers. Those who have done well should be commended and encouraged; those who have excluded, made things difficult for, and attacked disabled soldiers and demobilized construction soldiers must be dealt with seriously; the problems that exist in the work should be carefully studied and resolved; those that cannot be resolved or are temporarily difficult to resolve should also be explained and educated. On the army's side, inspections should be made of mass discipline and relations with the local government. Problems existing in the use of civilian housing, requisition of land, and the demarcation of restricted areas should be properly resolved. Model examples of abiding by mass discipline and government policies and laws should be commended; phenomena of violating laws and regulations and being divorced from the masses should be criticized and appropriately handled.
    3. All localities should, according to their specific circumstances, take the following approaches to carry out activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen and support the government and cherish the people:
      (1) Organize representatives from local organs, organizations, enterprises, schools, agricultural production cooperatives, and other units to visit the wounded and sick in hospitals, recuperating personnel, students in revolutionary disabled soldier schools, students in reformatories, families of martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to understand their living, production, and working conditions and solicit their opinions.
      (2) Organize families of martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to hold symposiums or get-togethers with local organs and units.
      (3) Counties, cities, districts, townships, and organs, organizations, enterprises, schools, and other units with a large number of disabled soldiers and demobilized construction soldiers should convene representative meetings or symposiums of families of martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to convey the spirit of the National Congress of Socialist Construction Activists of Families of Martyrs, Families of Servicemen, Disabled Soldiers, and Demobilized Construction Soldiers, review the work of preferential treatment and demobilization resettlement, and conduct education for them.
    
    4. Supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen and supporting the government and cherishes the people is a regular political task. People's committees at all levels, the broad masses of the people, and the troops should regularly implement the work of supporting and cherishing the army and supporting the government and cherishing the people. In rural areas, a certain number of families of martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers should be absorbed to participate in the work of the township civil affairs committees. The urban and rural grassroots preferential treatment committees and preferential treatment groups should be rectified and sound working systems should be established in order to effectively carry out the work of preferential treatment and resettlement of demobilized construction soldiers.
    After receiving this notice, the people's committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government, and all troops should make specific arrangements in accordance with the spirit of the notice and report the progress of the work to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army separately.

    国务院通知春节开展拥军优属拥政爱民工作
    进一步密切军民关系和军政关系
    新华社16日讯　国务院关于在1957年春节前后开展拥军优属和拥政爱民工作的通知，全文如下：
    过去，我国在地方各级政府和广大人民群众中进行的“拥军优属”和在军队中进行的“拥政爱民”工作，对于密切军民关系、军政关系起了良好的作用。但是最近几年以来，由于国内处于和平建设的环境，有些地区对于拥军优属和有些部队对于拥政爱民工作重视不够；在复员建设军人中，还有少数人没有安置，也还有少数人不安心劳动生产和现在的工作岗位，需要进行教育。为了进一步加强军民团结、军政团结，巩固国防，发挥烈属、军属、残废军人、复员建设军人的生产积极性和政治热情，推进我国的社会主义建设，全国地方各级人民委员会、广大人民群众和部队，应当在1957年春节前后，普遍开展拥军优属和拥政爱民活动。
    一、要进行一次深入的拥军优属和拥政爱民的宣传教育。在地方工作人员和广大人民群众中，着重宣传中国人民解放军和烈属、军属、残废军人、复员建设军人在中国革命战争和保卫祖国社会主义建设中的伟大贡献，说明关心和帮助他们解决困难，是各级人民政府、全体工作人员和广大人民群众的光荣责任。在军队中，应当教育全体官兵进一步密切与人民群众的联系，永远保持人民军队艰苦奋斗的优良传统，遵守政府的政策法令，积极支持和参加国家的社会主义建设事业。在边疆和少数民族地区的部队，应当特别注意团结当地民族，尊重他们的风俗习惯。在烈属、军属、残废军人、复员建设军人中，要教育和鼓励他们继续发扬革命的光荣传统，提高社会主义的思想觉悟，和当地群众团结在一起，积极参加生产和工作，争取在国家的社会主义建设事业中作出更大的贡献。
    二、对优抚、安置复员建设军人工作和军政关系、军民关系方面，进行一次深入的检查。地方各级人民委员会和当地驻军领导机关应当组织联席座谈会，检查优抚、安置复员建设军人工作和军政关系、军民关系，互相征求意见。各有关的机关、团体、企业、学校和农村的基层组织、农业生产合作社等，要根据1955年5月“国务院关于安置复员建设军人工作的决议”和国家的优抚政策，着重深入检查优待劳动日和安置复员军人的工作。对于做得好的，要给予表扬、鼓励；对于排斥、刁难、打击残废军人、复员建设军人的，必须严肃处理；对于工作上所存在的问题，要认真加以研究和解决；不能解决或者暂时难以解决的，亦应当进行解释教育。军队方面，要检查群众纪律、与驻地政府的关系，对于在使用民房、征用土地以及划禁区等方面所存在的问题，应当妥善加以解决；对于遵守群众纪律、遵守政府政策法令的模范事例，要加以表扬；对于违法乱纪、脱离群众的现象，要予以批评和适当处理。
    三、各地应当根据具体情况，采取以下几种方式，进行拥军优属和拥政爱民活动：
      （1）组织所在地的机关、团体、企业、学校、农业生产合作社等单位的代表，访问医院的伤病员、休养员，革命残废军人学校、教养院的学员，烈属、军属、残废军人、复员建设军人，了解他们的生活、生产和工作情况，征求他们的意见。
      （2）组织烈属、军属、残废军人、复员建设军人同驻地机关单位举行座谈会或联欢会。
      （3）各县、市、区、乡和残废军人、复员建设军人较多的机关、团体、企业、学校等单位，应当召开烈属、军属、残废军人、复员建设军人代表大会或座谈会，传达全国烈属、军属、残废军人、复员建设军人社会主义建设积极分子大会的精神，检查优抚和复员安置工作，并对他们进行教育。
    四、拥军优属和拥政爱民工作，是一项经常性的政治任务。地方各级人民委员会、广大人民群众和部队，应当把拥军优属和拥政爱民工作经常地贯彻下去。在农村里应当吸收一定数量的烈属、军属、残废军人、复员建设军人参加乡民政委员会的工作。对于城乡基层的优抚委员会和优抚小组，应当加以整顿，健全工作制度，以便切实做好优抚和安置复员建设军人工作。
    各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会和各部队在接到这一通知后，应当根据通知的精神，进行具体安排，并将工作进行情况，分别报告内务部和中国人民解放军总政治部。
