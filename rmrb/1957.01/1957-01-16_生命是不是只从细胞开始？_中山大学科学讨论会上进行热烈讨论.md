Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 15th: On January 13th, at the third scientific conference of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, Associate Professor Jiang Jingbo reported on his paper "Research on the Serous Characteristics of Sarcocystis." This paper described the author's research process and preliminary conclusions on the origin of cells. The author used the serum of non-cellular Sarcocystis for cultivation. He discovered granules, spheres, strips, and small sporocysts with cell shapes that had definite morphology. He believes this is the process of cell evolution. If this process is further confirmed, it means that cells can evolve from non-cells.

Whether life only begins from cells is a fundamental question in biology. The German scholar Virchow determined early on that "cells can only be produced by cells." Later, the Soviet scholar Lepeshinskaya used ground hydra serum for culture experiments and found that it had the ability to evolve into cells. However, in recent years, some biologists in the Soviet Union and China have repeated Lepeshinskaya's experiments, and the results proved that it was not a process of cell evolution.

Jiang Jingbo followed Lepeshinskaya's direction for research, and he found that Lepeshinskaya's mistakes lay in inappropriate selection of materials and crude research methods, but the research direction was correct.

At the discussion, participants had a heated discussion on this issue. Professors Chen Xintao and Yu Zhichen of Sun Yat-sen University believe that Jiang Jingbo's research is a good start and has achieved something that predecessors have not; however, whether this serum can evolve into cells in the culture process remains to be further confirmed. Associate Professor Zhou Yuwen expressed doubts about Jiang Jingbo's research results, and he believes that Jiang Jingbo has problems in terms of material selection and research methods. Professor Chen Bokang believes that this research is of great significance to the development of new cytology. Jiang Jingbo listened to everyone's opinions and is preparing to formulate a plan for further research, preparing to complete this research in two or three years.

    生命是不是只从细胞开始？
    中山大学科学讨论会上进行热烈讨论
    新华社广州15日电　13日，在广州中山大学第三次科学讨论会上，江静波副教授报告了他的论文“住肉胞子虫浆液特性的研究”。这篇论文叙述了作者研究细胞起源的经过和初步结论。作者用非细胞形态的住肉胞子虫的浆液进行培养，他发现了有明确形态的颗粒体、球体、条状体和具有细胞形状的小胞子体，他认为这是细胞演变的过程。如果这一过程得到进一步的证实，那就是说，细胞可以由非细胞演变而成。
    生命是不是只从细胞开始，这是生物学上的一个根本问题。德国学者微耳和很早就确定“细胞只能由细胞产生”。后来苏联学者勒柏辛斯卡娅用水螅的磨碎浆液作培养试验，发现它具有演变成细胞的能力。但是近年来，苏联和我国的有些生物学家又重复了勒柏辛斯卡娅的试验，结果证明它并不是细胞演变的过程。
    江静波遵循着勒柏辛斯卡娅的方向进行研究，他发现勒柏辛斯卡娅错误的地方在于取材不适合，研究方法粗糙，而研究方向却是正确的。
    在讨论会上，参加者对这个问题展开了热烈的讨论。中山大学陈心陶教授和于志忱教授认为江静波的研究是一个很好的开端，做到了前人所没有做到的地方；但是这种浆液在培养过程中是否能演变成细胞，还待进一步证实。周郁文副教授对江静波的研究结果表示怀疑，他认为江静波在取材上，研究方法上都有问题。陈伯康教授认为，这个研究对新细胞学的发展有很大意义。江静波听取了大家的意见，正着手拟定进一步研究的计划，准备在两、三年内完成这项研究。
