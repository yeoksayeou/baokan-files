Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch: Enterprises under the Ministry of Chemical Industry have completed the total industrial output value stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan one year and five months ahead of schedule. By the end of 1956, the output of seven of the thirteen major products, including caustic soda, penicillin, sulfa drugs, synthetic ammonia, and potassium chlorate, had reached the 1957 level.

In order to meet the needs of China's economic construction, the synthetic ammonia industry has been actively developed in recent years, and the acid-base, rubber, dye, and plastics industries have been appropriately developed. Furthermore, antibiotics and sulfa drugs, which play a significant role and have special curative effects in people's medical and health care, have been produced. By the end of 1956, the output of major products such as synthetic ammonia had increased to 3.3 times that of 1952; caustic soda to 3.1 times that of 1952; and automobile tires to 1.6 times that of 1952. In the pharmaceutical industry, although the original foundation was weak, by the end of 1956, penicillin production had reached more than 120 billion units, and sulfa drugs had reached 1,415 tons.

From 1953 to the end of 1956, enterprises under the Ministry of Chemical Industry successfully trial-produced 841 new products, including rubber products, paints, dyes, pharmaceuticals, organic synthetic products, and inorganic products. The pesticide 666 produced by enterprises under this ministry can protect 76 million mu of farmland from pests, and the produced DDT can prevent the loss of 5 billion jin of grain. In the past four years, due to the trial production of many new products by the rubber industry, the main varieties of tires have basically met the needs of the aviation industry and transportation industry, and more than 90 types of rubber accessories required for the Liberation brand automobile have been successfully trial-produced. In terms of chemical machinery production, in July 1956, the first multi-layer high-pressure synthesis cylinder was successfully trial-produced and proved to fully meet international standards after blasting tests. Other important chemical equipment, such as 2,400-horsepower nitrogen compressors and mercury rectifiers, have also been successfully trial-produced and put into production one after another.

The improvement of the production level of the Ministry of Chemical Industry during the first Five-Year Plan period mainly relied on giving full play to the potential of existing enterprises, expanding old factories, and improving technical levels. From 1953 to 1956, the chemical industry system expanded and renovated a total of ten old factories, thereby increasing the supply of fertilizers, pesticides, acids, alkalis, rubber products, antibiotics, and sulfa drugs. At the same time, eleven new factories were started in the four years, some of which have been put into production, and some of which will be put into production successively in 1957. The completion of these new and renovated projects will begin to change the backwardness of China's chemical industry and lay a preliminary foundation for the further development of the chemical industry in the second Five-Year Plan.

    化学工业部门提前完成五年计划
    四年中试制成功八百多种新的橡胶、油漆、染料、医药、有机合成产品
    新华社31日讯　化学工业部所属企业已经提前一年零五个月完成了第一个五年计划规定的工业总产值。到1956年底，十三种主要产品已经有烧碱、青霉素、磺胺药类、合成氨、氯酸钾等七种产品产量达到了1957年水平。
    为了满足我国经济建设的需要，几年来积极地发展了合成氨工业，适当地发展了酸碱、橡胶、染料、塑料等工业，并且生产了对人民医疗卫生保健事业有重大作用、有特殊疗效的抗生素和磺胺类药品。到1956年底止，主要产品如合成氨产量已经增长为1952年的三点三倍；烧碱为1952年的三点一倍；汽车外胎为1952年的一点六倍。在医药工业方面，虽然原来基础薄弱，到1956年底止青霉素产量也达到十二万多亿单位，磺胺药类达到一千四百一十五吨。
    从1953年起到1956年底止，化学工业部所属企业试制成功了八百四十一种新产品，其中有橡胶制品、油漆、染料、医药、有机合成产品、无机产品等。这个部所属企业生产的农药六六六，可以使七千六百万亩的田地免于虫害，生产的滴滴涕可以使五十亿斤谷物免于损失。在过去的四年里，由于橡胶工业试制了不少新产品，目前轮胎的主要品种已经基本上满足了航空工业、交通运输业的需要，并且试制成功了解放牌汽车所需的九十多种橡胶配件。在化工机械生产方面，1956年7月份，试制成了第一台多层高压合成筒，经爆破试验证明完全符合国际标准。其他如二千四百马力氮气压缩机、水银整流器等重要化工设备也都试制成功，并且先后投入生产。
    化学工业部在第一个五年计划期间生产水平的提高，主要是依靠充分发挥旧有企业潜力，对旧厂进行扩建，以及提高技术水平等方面获得的。在1953年到1956年中，化学工业部系统一共扩建、改建了十个旧厂，因而增加了肥料、农药、酸碱、橡胶制品、抗生素类、磺胺药类产品的供应。和这同时，四年中还开始新建十一个新厂，其中有的已经投入生产，有的将在1957年内陆续投入生产。这些新建和改建项目的建成，将开始改变我国化学工业的落后面貌，并且为第二个五年计划化学工业的进一步发展打下初步基础。
