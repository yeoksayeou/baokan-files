Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 8th. (Xinhua News Agency reporters Yang Ying, Xu Lei) report: Fan Ruijuan and Yuan Xuefen, who played the two main characters in the ancient tragedy "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" on the screen, have both established happy families. In Fan Ruijuan's new house, where she married this New Year's Day, a big red "?" character was pasted on the wall. When reporters visited her new family on the 7th, the groom—Chen Bohong, a reporter from the China Youth Daily stationed in Shanghai—was anxiously waiting for his bride to come home for dinner. On this day, Fan Ruijuan attended the People's Congress and then rushed to make up for her cultural lessons, not returning home until after seven o'clock. The newly married couple toured the scenic spots of Suzhou during their honeymoon. Soon, the bride will travel to Nanjing, Jinan, Tianjin, and the Northeast for travel performances.

Yuan Xuefen, who played Zhu Yingtai, also got married last spring and is now preparing to become a mother with joy. Famous Shanghai Yue Opera actors Xu Yulan, Fu Quanxiang, and others have also married their loved ones since liberation.

In the old society, actresses were called "戏子" (xizi, performers), and were considered inferior. Some were bought as concubines. Famous actors Ma Zhanghua and Xiao Dangui were forced to commit suicide because of unhappy marriages. Some, who were fortunate enough to find loved ones, were unable to marry due to various obstacles. Fan Ruijuan recalled the past and told reporters with emotion: In the past, she had planned to sing opera for a few years while she was young, and when she became "old and faded," she would return to her hometown to live a hard life. But now, she is full of beautiful ideals for her artistic career and family life.

    “梁山伯”结婚了
    新华社上海8日电　新华社记者杨瑛、续磊报道：在银幕上饰演古代悲剧“梁山伯与祝英台”中两位主角的范瑞娟和袁雪芬，都已经建立起幸福的家庭。在今年元旦新婚的范瑞娟的新房里，贴着大红“?”字，记者在7日到她的新家庭去访问的时候，新郎——中国青年报驻上海记者陈伯鸿正在焦急地盼望新娘回家吃晚饭。这一天，范瑞娟开过人民代表大会，又赶去补习了文化课，七点多钟才回到家里。这对新婚夫妇在新婚假期游览了苏州名胜，不久以后，新娘即将到南京、济南、天津、东北等地去作旅行演出。
    扮演祝英台的袁雪芬也在去年春天结了婚，现在她怀着欣喜的心情准备做母亲了。上海著名的越剧演员徐玉兰、傅全香等，解放以后也都和自己心爱的人结了婚。
    在旧社会里，女演员被人们称为“戏子”，低人一等，有的被买去作妾，名演员马樟花、筱丹桂就是因为婚姻不如意而被迫自杀的。有的难得有了心爱的人，也因为受到各方面的阻难，不能成婚。范瑞娟回忆起往事，感慨地告诉记者：过去她曾经打算趁年青的时候唱几年戏，等到“人老珠黄”，就回到乡下去苦度一生。但是现在，她对自己的艺术事业和家庭生活都充满着美好的理想。
