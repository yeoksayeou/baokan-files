    "Eight Yuan Blown in by the Wind" Report Inaccurate
    Comrade Meng Fansi Sends Letter of Self-Criticism

To the Editors:

    The People's Daily published my article "Eight Yuan Blown in by the Wind" on page four on December 5th, criticizing the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee for indiscriminately issuing disaster relief funds for typhoon damage to Guanyun County. Due to my lack of comprehensive and in-depth investigation and understanding, the problems I exposed deviated somewhat from the facts. Originally, this appropriation was not specifically for repairing houses, and it could be used for mutual adjustment. At the time, I subjectively believed that it was a case of special funds being used for other purposes, and described it as "wasteful," which was incorrect. I also fabricated a poem out of thin air. In addition, in order to encourage Comrade Li Mei's enthusiasm for writing in the future, his name was also written on it. This manuscript was written by me and I should be fully responsible for it personally. I made a mistake in reporting inaccurate information, which damaged the prestige of the Party newspaper. I am determined to correct this in the future.
　　Meng Fansi

Editor's Note: After this manuscript was published, we successively received letters from the General Office of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee, the Education Section of Guanyun County, and several readers. They all mentioned that the appropriation from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education and the Department of Finance to Guanyun County was not "funds for repairing school houses damaged by typhoons." The meeting of middle school principals convened by the Education Section of Guanyun County did not discuss "dividing" this fund, and so on. We believe that Comrade Meng Fansi's attitude of writing based on imagination and fabrication is not serious. When we reviewed the manuscript, although we investigated with the author, we did not directly check with the relevant departments, and our handling of the manuscript was not cautious enough, and we should improve in the future.

    “风吹来的八万元”报道失实
    作者孟繁思同志来信检讨编辑同志：
    人民日报12月5日四版刊登了我写的“风吹来的八万元”一文，批评江苏省人民委员会给灌云县滥发台风灾害的救济费。因我缺乏全面、深入的调查了解，所揭发的问题同事实有些出入。原来这项拨款，不是专为修房用的，可以互相调节使用。当时我却主观地认为是专款不专用，说成是“浪费”，这是不对的。我还无中生有的捏造了一首诗。此外，为了鼓励李枚同志今后写稿的积极性，把他的名字也写上了，此稿是我写的，应该完全由我个人负责。我犯了报道失实的错误，损害了党报的威信，我今后决心改正。　孟繁思
    编者按：此稿发表以后，我们先后收到了江苏省人民委员会办公厅、灌云县教育科以及几位读者的来信，他们都提到：江苏省教育厅与财政厅给灌云县的拨款，并不是“各中学修理被台风袭击的房屋”经费。灌云县教育科召开的各中学校长会议，也没有讨论“分割”此款，等等。我们认为：孟繁思同志这种凭想像、捏造的写稿态度，是不严肃的。我们在审阅该稿时，虽曾向作者调查过，但没有同有关部门直接查对，处理此稿也不够谨慎，今后应当改进。
