Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 17th: The China Food Company's Jiangsu Provincial branch purchased over 3.2 million head of live pigs last year, an increase of more than 1.15 million head compared to the actual purchase in the previous year.

Jiangsu Province suffered severe natural disasters last year. Due to the development of agricultural collectivization and national assistance, the production of live pigs still increased. The number of live pigs in stock at the end of last year in the province increased by more than 800,000 head compared to the end of 1955.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 18th: During this Spring Festival, the urban population of Jiangsu Province will be able to eat an average of approximately 1.7 jin of pork per person, and the rural population will also have 1.3 jin per person. The China Food Company's Jiangsu Provincial branch is preparing to supply live pigs to twelve cities including Nanjing, Changzhou, and Wuxi during the Spring Festival, an increase of more than 12% compared to the same period last year. The supply of live pigs to rural areas will also increase by 5%.

The live pigs supplied for the Spring Festival were all raised by farmers last year. At the end of last year, the number of live pigs in stock in the province increased by approximately 800,000 head compared to the previous year. Currently, food company employees in pig-producing areas are working hard to overcome the transportation difficulties caused by the cold weather, frozen rivers, and snow-covered ground, striving to complete the transfer of live pigs for urban festival use seven to ten days before the festival.

The methods for supplying pork during the festival have also been improved. Each city has increased temporary supply points and sales and cashier personnel to minimize queuing and crowding. At the same time, temporary slaughterhouses have also been added to increase processing capacity.

State-owned food companies in various parts of Jiangsu Province are also actively expanding the supply of beef, mutton, chicken, and duck to supplement the shortage of pork supply.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 18th: Jiangxi Province is transferring a large number of fat pigs to supply residents of major cities and industrial and mining areas for the Spring Festival. The batch of fat pigs being transferred totals more than 23,000 head, with an average weight of more than 120 jin per head.

Recently, the work of purchasing live pigs in Jiangxi Province has progressed rapidly. In November of last year, the daily average purchase of live pigs was only more than 1,800 head, but by late December, it had increased to an average of more than 4,800 head per day. The province's live pig inventory has increased from more than 25,000 head in early December to more than 58,000 head. Due to the improvement in the live pig purchase situation, there has been an increase in both the pork consumed by the local people during the Spring Festival and the pork transferred to other areas.

    春节供应的这些生猪，都是农民去年饲养的，去年年底全省生猪圈存数比前年增加约八十万头。目前生猪产区的食品公司职工正在努力克服天寒河冻、大雪遮地所造成的运输上的困难，争取在节前七天到十天把供城市节日用的生猪调运完毕。
    节日猪肉供应方法也有了改进。各城市都增加了临时供应点和售货、收款人员，尽量减少排队拥挤现象。同时，还增添了临时宰猪场，以提高加工能力。
    江苏省各地国营食品公司还积极扩大牛、羊肉和鸡、鸭的供应，以补助猪肉供应的不足。
    新华社南昌18日电　江西省正在调运出大批肥猪，供应大城市和工矿区居民过春节。这批调出的肥猪共两万三千多头，每头体重平均一百二十多斤。
