    Don't Forget the Sheep When Making Production Plans
    To ensure the supply of meat and increase fertilizer, the newspaper is constantly advocating raising pigs; I think raising sheep is also very important.
    Everyone knows that sheep have four valuable products: wool can be harvested twice a year, which can be used as raw materials for felt, blankets, and all woolen yarns. Sheepskin is a raw material for winter clothing, and lambskin is even more valuable. Mutton and mutton fat are important foods, and fat can also be used for industrial products. Sheep manure is a good fertilizer rich in phosphorus and potassium.
    Raising sheep also saves in several aspects: first, it saves labor. At most, two or three people are needed to graze more than a hundred sheep. Unlike raising pigs, people don't have to make feed and feed them several times a day. Second, it saves space. Except in winter, sheep do not occupy feeding pens. They graze on the hillsides during the day, drink water in the river bends, and stay overnight in the fields (farmers call it "sleeping sheep." Spring "sleeping" in the autumn fields, and "sleeping" in the wheat fields after the wheat harvest). Third, it saves feed. Except in winter, sheep generally do not eat grain. Fourth, it saves transporting manure. Sheep excrete manure directly in the cultivated land, without people having to carry it or haul it by carts.
    I recently returned to my hometown in Shanxi and talked to the farmers about the autumn harvest. They mostly reflected that too much corn was planted last year, but the corn did not grow well; the reason, in addition to the planting density method being worthy of study, was insufficient fertilizer. When asked why they didn't "sleep the sheep" on the fields, they said: "There are too few sheep now, because there is no feed in winter (referring to black beans)." They also said, "Even the cattle don't have enough 'feed' to eat, how can we feed the sheep?" It turns out that if they don't eat "feed" in winter, the ewes will not produce milk, the lambs will not grow up, and the general mortality rate is high. This creates difficulties in developing sheep flocks. It is understood that the lack of sheep is not only a problem of "feed," because there is a shortage of soybeans, and bean stalks and pod skins are also extremely scarce. However, these by-products are the best supplementary feed for sheep flocks when "snow closes the mountain gates" in winter.
    Due to the large-scale planting of corn and the reduced planting of millet and beans, the number of sheep has decreased; the decrease in the number of sheep has in turn hindered the increase in grain production. This has become a serious problem in agricultural production in mountainous areas.
    What I have seen is only the situation in my hometown, but in the North China mountainous area, the climate and soil are roughly the same, and the problem of raising sheep has its universal significance. I hope that comrades leading agricultural production will take this into consideration when planning to plant high-yield crops and considering fertilizer issues. Li Jincai

### 订生产计划的时候不要把羊忘掉

    订生产计划的时候不要把羊忘掉
    为了保证肉食的供应和增加肥料，报上不断提倡养猪；我看养羊也很重要。
    谁都知道，羊身上有四种宝贵的产物：一年能收获两次毛，可作毛毡、毛毯以及一切毛呢毛线的原料。羊皮是做冬衣的原料，羊羔皮更是较珍贵的东西。羊脂、羊肉是重要的食品，脂肪还可作工业用品。羊粪是富有磷钾的好肥料。
    养羊还有几方面的节省：一是省人工。一百多只羊，至多只用两三个人放牧，不用像养猪一样，成天要人给做饲料，喂多少次。二是省场地。除冬季外，羊群不占饲养的场圈。白日在山坡吃草，在河湾饮水，夜间宿在田地上（农民叫作“卧羊”。春季卧秋田，麦收后卧麦田）。三是省饲料。除冬季外，一般不吃谷物食粮。四是省送粪。羊就在耕地上排泄了粪便，不用人挑车拉。
    我最近回到在山西的老家，和农民谈到秋收情况，他们大都反映：去年种玉米太多，但玉米没有长好；原因除密植方法值得研究外，还有肥料不足。问他们为什么不“卧羊”呢？他们说：现在养羊太少了，因为冬天没有料（指黑豆）。又说：“牛还没有‘料’吃，哪能喂羊呢？”原来冬天不吃“料”，母羊就不生奶，小羊就长不大，一般的死亡率也高。这就造成发展羊群的困难。据了解，养羊少还不光是“料”的问题，因为种豆类少，豆秸豆荚皮也奇缺，而这种副产物，是冬季“雪闭山门”时候羊群最好的补充食料。
    由于大量种了玉米，少种了谷子和豆类，使羊减少了；羊的减少又反过来妨碍了粮食的增产。这就成为山区农业生产上的一个严重问题。
    我见到的虽只是自己家乡的情况，但在华北山区来说，气候土质大致相同，养羊问题是有其普遍意义的。希望领导农业生产的同志，在计划种植高产作物和考虑肥料问题的时候考虑到这一点。　李晋材
