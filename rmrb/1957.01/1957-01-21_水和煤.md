    Water and Coal
    By our correspondent Lu Hao
    We were very happy to be guests at the home of Professor Vladimir Semenovich Muchnik. Professor Muchnik is the famous creator of hydraulic coal mining.

    Professor Muchnik's wife was also a coal mine engineer. Today, she specially made famous Ukrainian borscht from her hometown for us. She also brought out jam made from wild fruits she personally collected to treat us. Their daughter is currently studying at the Leningrad Mining Institute and is spending her summer vacation at home these days. There are many such families in the Kuzbass coalfield area. Several generations of a family, men and women, old and young, understand coal, love coal, and are unwilling to separate from coal for life.

    Everyone knows that water has always been the coal mine's vicious enemy. When excavating new shafts, people must fight against the raging groundwater. Relentless floods can instantly submerge all machinery and roadways, so powerful pumps must be installed in the mine to continuously drain water to the surface day and night. No wonder the world's first steam engine was installed in a mine to pump water. And Professor Muchnik, who is sitting in front of me now, was the first to consider using hydraulic mining as early as twenty-one years ago.

    His face is rosy, and his gray and black hair is intricately and neatly curled on his wide forehead. He is refined, and his voice is not loud, but it is decisive and powerful. As soon as you meet him, you know that he is a man full of perseverance.

    When we were in Moscow, we heard that as early as 1935, when Muchnik was a student at the Leningrad Mining Institute, the ideal of hydraulic coal mining began to burn in his heart. His conversation started from this point.

    At that time, mechanization had been widely used in the Soviet coal mining industry. Not long ago, miners had to dig coal with picks bare-bodied, and then laboriously pull sleds along low roadways to transport the coal out, but now they have been liberated from heavy labor. The young Muchnik often went to the coal mines. He saw that mechanization increased the coal production capacity dozens of times at once, but at the same time he also saw the many auxiliary processes increased due to the realization of mechanization. For example, to widen the roadways, to install and repair machines, and to have more electricity supply, so the actual work efficiency of mechanization was relatively weakened. He thought: Can several processes be linked together? Can we find a simpler, more convenient, and more efficient method?

    In those years, Muchnik searched for many methods, but none of them could help him solve this problem. Later, he saw hydraulic gold panning in gold mines; at the construction site of hydropower stations, he saw people using hydraulic power to peel the skin and dig the soil. He thought: Can water be led underground? Can hydraulic power be used for ventilation, transportation, and coal mining...?

    When Muchnik graduated from the Mining Institute, he wrote his views on hydraulic coal mining into a graduation thesis entitled: On Hydraulic Coal Mining.

    When Muchnik first proposed the issue of hydraulic coal mining, it caused a great shock in the engineering and technical circles of the coal mining industry at that time. Almost no one could really believe that humans could use hydraulic power to mine coal underground. After graduating from the Mining Institute, Muchnik was assigned to work in the All-Union Coal Mining Research Institute. Here, his proposal for hydraulic coal mining was opposed by many people. Muchnik asked for a trial, and the leaders of the Research Institute said: "There is no fact to prove that your suggestion is superior, how can you allow a coal-producing mine to give you a trial?"

    Unable to get support, Muchnik ran to the Party Central Committee to appeal. The Party Central Committee supported him, and he began a trial at a mine of the Arnonikidze Coal Company in Donbass. This was a very small mine, producing only more than two hundred tons of coal per day. At that time, the technical equipment for hydraulic coal mining was still very simple. The coal suction machine was section by section, and if the coal lumps were a little larger, they could not be sucked up. The structure of the water gun was not strong, and it was often flattened by falling rocks. However, the work efficiency was still very high, and the output of hydraulic coal mining was higher than that of neighboring mines.

    Soon, the Patriotic War broke out. Muchnik went to the army to serve, and the experimental work of hydraulic coal mining was completely stopped. When Muchnik talked about this, he told us in passing: To commemorate this meaningful experiment, the name of that mine in Donbass is still called the First Hydraulic Coal Mine to this day.

    After the war, Muchnik was assigned to Kuzbass to serve as the director of the Coal Mining Research Institute. At that time, hydraulic coal mining had gained the trust of many people in the Research Institute; but the leading comrades of the coal mine did not give him a mine for experiments, and the ministry did not support him either. They said: Hydraulic coal mining still lacks theoretical basis, and it is meaningless to start experiments without theoretical basis.

    Without a laboratory, of course, no experimental results can be produced, how can Muchnik write a theory? He raised his opinions again and again, and asked for experimental mines again and again. Not only did it not have any results, but it aroused the resentment of the leaders. They said: Why is this person so undisciplined and so disobedient. What was once recognized before the war is now negated by scientific bureaucracy.

    I remember the hydraulic coal mining situation we saw in Leninsk yesterday. Here, you can neither see coal cars rolling on light railways, nor hear the noisy sounds of drilling and blasting and coal cutting machines intertwined. Only the water sprayed from the water gun like a sharp knife towards the coal seam. After the hard coal was impacted by the water, it seemed that the entire coal seam was trembling, paralyzed, and friable. It collapsed, making a booming echo like spring thunder in the palm, as if the entire mine was about to collapse. The black and bright coal, some of which had become crushed, was washed down with the water. Passing through the flume, like what we often see on belt conveyors, it was continuously washed to the central sump of the shaft...

    On such a working face, except for seeing two water gun workers working next to the water gun, almost no one else can be seen working on the face. Sometimes, you can only occasionally see one or two girls, wearing miner's clothes and carrying safety lamps, checking the safety work underground. Thinking of the wonderful situation now, who could have imagined that the road taken by such a scientifically valuable creation was so tortuous?

    Nothing is more painful than being misunderstood, but Muchnik did not lose heart. Later, he finally got the opportunity to start hydraulic coal mining experiments at the Derigansky coal mine.

    Almost the entire coal mining engineering and technical community was paying attention to him. Professor Muchnik said when recalling this situation: Although he was confident, he was really worried that he would fail in such a time.

    In the beginning, the water was often frozen by the cold of Siberia, and its great power could not be exerted at all. Due to the low air pressure and the small force of the water, it could not penetrate the hard coal seam at will, and sometimes explosives had to be used to blast it open. However, half of the coal after blasting could not be transported to the shaft.

    The experimental situation was reported to the leading authorities, and this gave the opponents of hydraulic coal mining an excuse. They said: "If this experiment cannot succeed in a short period of time, it should be stopped!" In fact, such a complex scientific experiment as hydraulic coal mining is very difficult to see all the results in half a year or a year.

    Muchnik disagreed with this view, and those who opposed hydraulic coal mining said that he was a person who did not accept other people's opinions and did not accept criticism.

    Because he did not act according to the instructions of the superiors, the Coal Mining Research Institute was simply dissolved. Muchnik suffered so many setbacks, but he did not lose heart. He kept appealing to the Party Central Committee. The Party Central Committee supported him, and the experimental work of hydraulic coal mining continued.

    In difficult days, dear friends gave Muchnik great support and help. At that time, people could not adjust the water pressure as desired according to the hardness or softness of the coal seam, and there were no skilled water gun workers underground. In order to understand the actual operation of the water gun, engineer Dedlovich personally operated the water gun. The water sprayed from the water gun had a hydraulic pressure of fifty atmospheres. If it was shot on a person, it could chop the person in half like a sharp sword. Dedlovich was the engineer who directed hydraulic coal mining in those days, and he was also a skilled water gun worker. Until now, everyone remembers that the first batch of water gun workers were trained by him. In the beginning, the water pressure often caused the water pipes to burst, and they had to be repaired every day, which was very troublesome. Engineers Tsybko and Kostkin jointly came up with a method that not only prevented the water pipes from breaking, but also made the water pipes stronger as the water pressure increased. The design of all the coal suction machines was almost entirely carried out under the leadership of Shakolov. When Professor Muchnik talked to us about this situation, he said in a hearty voice and with great pleasure: When I work with my comrades, it is really difficult to say who created something, because we all feel that without anyone leaving anyone, there can be no success.

    Muchnik's wife, who had been listening to our conversation, couldn't help but express her opinion at this time. She said: "Just the fact that hydraulic coal mining can ensure the safety of miners, I wholeheartedly support his work!"

    Muchnik did not object, he said with a smile: "For several years, there has only been one accident involving a worker in a hydraulic coal mine; but this accident has nothing to do with hydraulic coal mining in practice."

    水和煤
    本报记者　陆灏
    我们非常高兴在弗拉季米尔·西敏诺维奇·穆奇尼克教授家里作客。穆奇尼克教授是著名的水力采煤的创造人。
    穆奇尼克教授的妻子也曾经是一个煤矿工程师，她今天特意为我们做了她家乡有名的乌克兰菜汤，她还拿出亲自采集的野果所做的果酱款待我们。他们的女儿现在在列宁格勒矿业学院学习，这些日子正在家里过暑假。在库兹巴斯煤田区有很多这样的家庭，一家好几代，男的女的，老的少的，他们懂得煤，爱上了煤，终身都不愿意和煤分开。
    谁也知道水从来就是煤矿的凶恶的敌人。在开凿新的井筒的时候，人们要同汹涌的地下水作斗争。无情的洪水一下子就会淹没所有的机器和巷道，所以在矿井里头必须装置强大的水泵，日夜不断地把水排到地面上来。怪不得世界上第一台蒸汽机就是装置在矿井里用来抽水的。而现在坐在我面前的穆奇尼克教授，就是早在二十一年以前第一个考虑到用水力采煤的人。
    他的脸孔红润润的，灰白的和黑的头发错综而又整齐地卷伏在他的宽宽的前额上边。他文质彬彬，说话的声音不高，但斩钉截铁似地很有力量，一见面，你就能够知道他是一个充满毅力的人。
    我们在莫斯科的时候，就听说过还是1935年穆奇尼克在列宁格勒矿业学院当学生的时候，他的心里就开始燃烧起水力采煤的理想了。他的谈话就是从这个地方开始的。
    那时候，机械化已经在苏联的采煤工业中大量运用。不久之前，矿工们本来要光着身子用手镐刨煤，然后沿着低低的巷道吃力地拉着拖橇把煤炭运出去，而现在都从沉重的劳动中解放出来了。年青的穆奇尼克常常去煤矿走动，他看到机械化把煤炭生产的能力一下子提高了好几十倍，但同时他也看到，因为实现机械化增加的很多辅助工序。譬如要加宽巷道，要安装和修理机器，要更多的电力供应，因而机械化的实际工作效率就相对地削弱了。他想：能不能把几个工序都连在一起，能不能找到一种更简单、更方便而效率又高的办法？
    那几年，穆奇尼克寻找过很多方法，但是没有一个方法可以帮助他解决这个问题。后来，他在金矿看到过利用水力淘金；在修筑水电站的工地上，又看到过人们利用水力剥开地皮和挖土。他想：能不能把水引到地下，是不是可以利用水力来通风、运输和采煤……。
    穆奇尼克在矿业学院毕业的时候，他把自己对于水力采煤问题的看法，写成了一篇毕业论文，题目是：论水力采煤。
    当穆奇尼克第一个把水力采煤的问题提出来的时候，引起了当时采煤工业部门的工程技术界的很大的震动。几乎没有人可以真正相信人类能够在地下利用水力开采煤炭。矿业学院毕业以后，穆奇尼克被派到全苏采煤研究所去工作。在这里，他的水力采煤的提议遭到了很多人的反对。穆奇尼克要求试验，研究所的领导人说：“没有事实可以证明你的建议是优越的，怎么可以让生产煤炭的矿井给你作试验呢？”
    穆奇尼克得不到支持，跑到党中央来申诉。党中央支持了他，他在顿巴斯的阿尔诺尼基煤矿公司的一个矿井开始了试验工作。这是一个很小的矿井，每天只出二百多吨煤。当时水力采煤的技术装备还很简陋，吸煤机是一节一节的，煤块稍许大些，就吸不上来，水枪的构造不坚固，石头滚下来就常常把它压扁了。但是，工作的效率还是很高的，水力采煤比邻近的矿井的产量还要高。
    不久，卫国战争起来了。穆奇尼克到军队中去服役，水力采煤的试验工作就完全停了下来。穆奇尼克谈到这里，他附带告诉我们说：顿巴斯的那座矿井为了纪念这次有意义的试验，它的名字直到现在还叫第一水力采煤矿呢。
    战后，穆奇尼克被派到库兹巴斯担任采煤研究所长。当时，水力采煤在研究所里已经获得了很多人的信任；但煤矿的领导同志却不给他试验用的矿井，部里也不支持他。他们说：水力采煤还缺乏理论根据，没有理论根据开始试验是没有意义的。
    没有实验室，当然不能产生什么实验的结果，穆奇尼克怎么能写成理论呢？他一次又一次提意见，一次又一次地要求有实验的矿井。不但没有任何结果，反而引起了领导者们的反感，他们说：这个人怎么这样不守纪律，这样不服从。战前曾一度被承认过的东西，现在又被科学上的官僚主义否定了。
    我记起我们昨天在列宁斯克看到的水力采煤的情形。在这里既看不见煤车辘辘地行驶在轻便铁道上，也听不见打眼放炮和割煤机交织在一起的嘈杂声音。只见从水枪里喷射出来的像利刀一般的水射向煤层，坚硬的煤炭受了水的冲击以后，就好像整个煤层都颤动了，瘫痪了，酥散了。它倒坍下来，在掌子里发出轰隆轰隆的像春雷般的回声，仿佛整个矿井都要崩裂下来。黑亮黑亮的煤炭，有的已经成了碎末。它随着水冲下来，经过水槽，像在皮带运输机上我们常常看到的那样，源源不断地被水冲向井筒中央的集水池去……
    在这样的工作面上除了在水枪旁边看到有两个水枪工在工作以外，几乎掌子面上再也见不到别的人在工作。有时候，偶然只能看到一、两个姑娘，她们穿着矿工的服装，提着安全灯，在检查井下的保安工作。想到现在这种奇妙的情形，谁能够想到像这样科学上的宝贵创造所经过道路是如此曲折的呢。
    再没有不被人了解更使人感到痛苦的了，但穆奇尼克并没有灰心，后来，终于得到了在德立干斯基煤井开始水力采煤的实验的机会。
    几乎是整个的采煤工程技术界都在注意着他。穆奇尼克教授在回忆这段情形的时候说：虽然是有信心的，但在这样的时候他也真担心自己会万一失败。
    开始，水常常被西伯利亚的寒冷冻结住了，根本就无法施展它的巨大的威力。由于气压小，水的力量小，它不能随心穿透坚硬的煤层，有时不得不用炸药来炸破。而爆破以后的煤炭，却又有一半运不到井上来。
    实验的情形汇报到了领导机关，这一下反对水力采煤的人可找到了借口。他们说：“如果这种试验在短时间内不能成功，就应该停止！”实际上，像水力采煤这样复杂的科学试验，无论如何也很难在半年或一年里面看到全部结果的。
    穆奇尼克不同意这样的看法，反对水力采煤的人说他是个不接受别人的意见，不接受批评的人。
    因为没有按照上级的意见办事，后来，采煤研究所干脆就被解散了。穆奇尼克受了这样多的挫折，但并没有灰心，他一直申诉到党中央。党中央支持了他，水力采煤的实验工作才又继续进行。
    在困难的日子里，亲爱的朋友们给了穆奇尼克极大的支持和帮助。那时候，人们还不能根据煤层的硬或软来如意地调节水的压力，井下也没有熟练的水枪工，为了了解水枪实际的操作的情形，工程师杰得洛维奇亲自来操作水枪。水枪喷射出来的有五十个大气压的水力，如果射在人身上，它能像利剑一样，把人一斩两段。杰得洛维奇在那些日子里是指挥水力采煤的工程师，又是一名熟练的水枪工。直到现在，大家还记得，第一批水枪工就是经他的手训练出来的。在开始的一个时期，水的压力常常使水管崩裂，天天要修，十分麻烦。工程师崔伯科和考斯金两人共同想了一个办法，不但使水管不折断，而水的压力越大，水管反而更坚固。全部吸煤机的设计，差不多全是在沙科洛夫一个人领导下进行的。穆奇尼克教授在和我们谈到这方面的情形时，他声音爽朗，无限愉快地对我们说：我和我的同志们在一起工作，有的东西真很难说这是谁创造的，因为我们大家都共同感觉到谁离开了谁，也不可能有什么成功。
    一直听着我们谈话的穆奇尼克的妻子，这时候也忍不住发表了意见。她说：“仅仅是水力采煤能使矿工的安全有保障这一点，我就全心地支持他的工作！”
    穆奇尼克也并不表示反对，他笑着说：几年以来在水力采煤的矿井内只有一个工人发生了一次事故；但这次事故和水力采煤实际上是没有什么关系的。”
