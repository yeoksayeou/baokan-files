    Increased Output in Soviet Machine Manufacturing; Vigorous Improvements in Technical Equipment for Production of Daily Necessities; Expanded Supply of Machines Needed for China's Construction This Year
    (Our Moscow dispatch, January 5th) Our correspondent Li He reports: The Minister of Machine Manufacturing of the Soviet Union, Nikolai Nikolaevich Smelyakov, gave an interview to reporters on January 4th. He discussed the recent developments in the Soviet machine manufacturing industry. These developments demonstrate that the Soviet Union has made significant technological progress and is vigorously improving the technical equipment for the production of daily necessities.
    Smelyakov said: All enterprises under the Soviet Ministry of Machine Manufacturing fulfilled their plans in 1956 in terms of total output, commodity output, and cost reduction. Output increased by 20% compared to 1955. In 1956, 587 new types of machines were manufactured, an increase of approximately 30% compared to 1955. Among these new machines are: small carding machines, flannel sewing machines replacing manual labor, automated weaving machines with a 20% increase in productivity, turbines that automatically adjust with water level fluctuations, canning machines that produce 100 cans of baby food per minute, mobile grain dryers specifically for newly cultivated land that can dry eight tons of grain per hour, etc.
    Enterprises under this industrial ministry have undertaken much work in improving their technology. In 1956, precision castings increased twenty-one times compared to 1955, die castings increased by 24%, and mold castings increased by 31%. The production technology of cutting parts with gas has been mastered. Machines have been manufactured that cut parts according to drawings with the help of photocells.
    Smelyakov said: All enterprises under the Soviet Ministry of Machine Manufacturing will increase output by 16% in 1957 compared to 1956; and will save 800 million rubles due to cost reductions. In 1957, automated continuous operation machines that produce 6,000 bottles per hour will be manufactured; a seamless (without thread, without wire) bookbinding machine that binds 40 books per minute; and machines for the large-scale production of man-made fibers. The basic characteristic of the new machines is higher productivity and lighter components.
    Smelyakov concluded by saying: The Soviet Ministry of Machine Manufacturing supplies machines to all People's Democratic countries, with the largest supply going to the People's Republic of China. This industrial ministry participated in the construction of 88 projects in China, such as the construction of hard alloy factories, ore refineries, steel plants, oil refineries, organic dye factories, chemical plants, etc. Last year, 24 types of machines were delivered to China, and this year the supply of machines needed for China will be expanded.

    苏联机器制造业产量提高
    正在大力改进生产日用品的技术设备
    今年将扩大供应中国建设所需的机器
    本报莫斯科5日电　本报记者李何报道：苏联机器制造部部长尼古拉·尼古拉耶维奇·斯麦利亚科夫4日对记者发表了谈话。他谈了苏联机器制造业最近发展的情况。这些情况表明，苏联技术进步很大，同时苏联正在大力改进生产人民生活必需品的技术设备。
    斯麦利亚科夫说：苏联机器制造部所有企业在总产量、商品产量和降低成本各方面在1956年都完成了计划，产量比1955年提高了20％。在1956年，制造了五百八十七种新式机器，即比1955年增加了约30％。在这些新式机器中有：小型梳棉机，代替手工的绒布缝纫机，提高生产率20％的自动化织布机，随着水位的涨落自动调节的涡轮机，一分钟生产一百罐儿童食品的制造罐头机，专供被开垦的新地上用的、一小时弄干八吨谷物的流动谷物干燥机等。
    这个工业部的企业在改进自己的技术方面进行了许多工作。在1956年，精密铸件比1955年增加二十一倍，压铸件增加了24％，模铸件增加了31％。掌握了用煤气截切零件的生产技术。制造了在光电池帮助下按图样截切零件的机器。
    斯麦利亚科夫说：苏联机器制造部所有企业在1957年将比1956年提高产量16％；由于降低成本，将节约八亿卢布。在1957年，将制造一小时生产六千个瓶子的自动连续工作机；一分钟装订四十回的书籍无缝（不用线，不用铁丝）装订机；大规模生产人造纤维的机器。新式机器的基本特点是生产率更高而机件更轻。
    斯麦利亚科夫最后说：苏联机器制造部供应所有人民民主国家机器，其中供应中华人民共和国的最多。这个工业部参加了中国八十八项工程的建设。如像建设硬质合金厂、炼矿厂、钢铁厂、石油制炼厂、有机染料厂、化学厂等等。去年交给了中国二十四种机器，今年将扩大供应中国所需的机器。
