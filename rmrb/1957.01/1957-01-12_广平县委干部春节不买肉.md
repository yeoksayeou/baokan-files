    Guangping County Committee Cadres Don't Buy Meat During Spring Festival

    (Our report) The office cadres of the Guangping County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hebei Province have decided not to buy pork, beef, or mutton during the Spring Festival, and have decided to sell the two fat pigs raised by the office to the food company in order to supply the needs of farmers during the Spring Festival. In addition, cadres with family members in the office also guaranteed to mobilize their family members not to rush to buy meat products during the Spring Festival; cadres whose family members are not in the office also plan to write letters to their families to persuade and mobilize them.

    These regulations were proposed and determined after discussion at a meeting of all office staff of the County Committee held on January 5. At the meeting, everyone unanimously agreed that the Spring Festival is a festival that farmers attach great importance to and requires a large amount of meat; however, the supply of meat is currently very tight and cannot meet the needs of the masses. For this reason, everyone decided to give priority to farmers to eat meat. At the meeting, everyone also proposed to eat less refined grains, reducing the proportion of refined grains from the current 40% to 30%. The cadres of the County Committee office originally saved two taels of grain per person per day, and now plan to save another tael per person per day. If it is not enough, they will use sweet potatoes, radishes, etc. to replace it.

    广平县委干部春节不买肉
    本报讯　中共河北省广平县委会的机关干部，决定在春节期间不买猪、牛、羊肉，并决定把机关养的两口肥猪卖给食品公司，以便供应春节期间农民的需要。此外，有家属在机关的干部，还保证动员家属在春节期间不抢购肉食品；家属不在机关的干部，也准备给家里写信，进行说服动员工作。
    这些规定，是在1月5日召开的县委全体机关工作人员会议上，由大家提出并经过讨论后确定的。会上，大家一致认为：春节是农民极为重视的节日，需要大量的肉食；但目前肉食供应很紧张，不能满足群众的需要。为此，大家决定把肉食首先让给农民食用。会上，大家还提出少吃细粮，把细粮由现在的40％减到30％。县委机关的干部原来每人每天节约二两粮食，现在计划每人每天再节约一两，不够的，用红薯、萝卜等代替。
