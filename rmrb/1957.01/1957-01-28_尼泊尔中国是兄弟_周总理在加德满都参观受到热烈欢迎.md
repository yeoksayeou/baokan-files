Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, January 27th: Premier Zhou Enlai visited an orphanage in Kathmandu at 10:00 AM on the 26th and donated 50,000 Nepalese Rupees to the orphanage.

Zhou Enlai wrote in the visitors' book of the orphanage, which was established by a charitable organization: "From the organization and work of this orphanage, I see that the government of the Kingdom of Nepal is working for the welfare of the people. The King and Queen are particularly concerned about the happiness of these children. I would like to wish the children of Nepal good health and unlimited prospects."

After leaving the orphanage, Premier Zhou Enlai and his party went to the suburbs to visit a Buddhist boarding school built on a beautiful hillside. After the guests visited various parts of the school, the students performed comic dialogues praising the achievements of New China and the Chinese Premier. In his address to the students, Zhou Enlai conveyed the greetings of Chinese youth to Nepalese youth.

Zhou Enlai and He Long continued up the mountain, took off their shoes and entered the temple, and paid their respects before the Buddha statue. A group of Buddhist scholars and male and female Buddhists gathered outside the temple, summoned by the Nepal Dharma Propagation Association, waiting for the guests. Speakers who took the podium warmly welcomed the Chinese Premier and pledged friendly relations between the people of China and Nepal.

The welcome speech of the Dharma Propagation Association mentioned the legend of Manjushri, who came from China to Nepal and used a sword to split the southern mountains, opening up waterways and draining the Kathmandu Valley. The welcome speech recalled the deeds of Nepal's Princess Harita Tara and China's Princess Wencheng of the Tang Dynasty in Tibet, as well as Xuanzang's visit to Nepal. The Dharma Propagation Association expressed its great pleasure at Premier Zhou Enlai's advocacy of Panchsheel. The members of the Dharma Propagation Association believe that this reminds them of the Buddha's five basic principles.

The famous Nepalese poet Chittadhar Hridaya, who had been to China, said in his welcome speech: "Today, we have the opportunity to see you under the sky of Nepal, and we regard it as a historical event."

As the guests left, everyone in the courtyard shouted "Long Live China-Nepal Friendship" and "Nepal and China are Brothers" in Chinese and Nepali.

Later, the guests went to a Buddhist temple on the top of the mountain and met with members of the Swayambhu Restoration Association, a group dedicated to studying the history and culture of the historically significant Mount Swayambhu. Premier Zhou Enlai presented a Hada and donated 10,000 Nepalese Rupees to the temple. The abbot of the temple expressed his gratitude to Premier Zhou Enlai.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long had lunch at the Royal Palace at noon.

    “尼泊尔中国是兄弟”
    周总理在加德满都参观受到热烈欢迎
    据新华社加德满都27日电　周恩来总理在26日上午十时参观了加德满都的一所孤儿院，并且捐赠了五万尼泊尔卢比给这个孤儿院。
    周恩来在这所由慈善团体设立的孤儿院的来宾留言簿上写道：“我从这所孤儿院的组织和工作上，看到尼泊尔王国政府正在为人民谋福利。国王和王后特别关怀这些儿童的幸福。我谨祝尼泊尔儿童身体健康，前途无量。”
    周恩来总理一行离开孤儿院后，到市郊去参观一所建筑在环境优美的小山上的佛教徒寄宿学校。在客人们参观了学校各部分以后，学生们表演了相声，赞扬新中国的各种成就和中国总理。周恩来在向学生们致辞时转达了中国青年对尼泊尔青年的问候。
    周恩来和贺龙继续上山，并且脱鞋进入了庙宇，在佛像前行了礼。一群由尼泊尔法林会召集来的佛学家和男女佛教徒聚集在庙宇外面等待着客人们。登上讲坛发言的人热烈欢迎中国总理，并且保证中国和尼泊尔两国人民之间的友好关系。
    法林会的欢迎词提到传说的从中国去尼泊尔的文殊师利用宝剑劈开南部小山开出水道，并且排除加德满都山谷的水。欢迎词追述了尼泊尔的哈丽塔·塔腊公主和中国唐朝的文成公主在西藏的事迹以及玄奘对尼泊尔的访问。法林会对周恩来总理提倡潘查希拉表示十分高兴。法林会的成员认为这使他们想起了佛陀的五项基本原则。
    曾经到过中国的著名的尼泊尔诗人契塔迪尔·赫里达亚在欢迎词中说：“今天，我们有机会在尼泊尔的天空之下看到你，我们把它看作一个历史事件。”
    当客人们离开的时候，整个庭院的人都用中国话和尼泊尔话高呼“中国尼泊尔友谊万岁”和“尼泊尔中国是兄弟”。
    后来，客人们到了山顶上的佛教寺院，会见了斯瓦孟布修身会的成员，这是一个专门从事研究称为斯瓦孟布的有历史意义的名山的历史和文化的团体。周恩来总理献了哈达，并且捐给寺院一万尼泊尔卢比。寺院主持对周恩来总理表示感谢。
    周恩来总理和贺龙副总理中午在皇宫进午餐。
