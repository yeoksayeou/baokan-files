Xinhua News Agency, January 11th -- According to the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency, the Bulgarian "Agricultural Banner" reported on the 9th that economic and cultural cooperation between China and Bulgaria is growing stronger.

The newspaper pointed out that economic exchanges between China and Bulgaria began after the two countries signed their first trade and payment agreement in 1952. The volume of trade between the two countries is constantly increasing. If 1952 is taken as 100, then 1955 increased to 244, and 1956 increased to 306. The newspaper pointed out that some commodities imported from China can only be purchased on the capitalist market with free foreign exchange.

Bulgaria will design two factories for China to mine and refine lead and zinc ore, and will supply them with equipment so that they can start operations before 1959.

In terms of scientific and technological cooperation, China and Bulgaria also maintain close ties.

Cultural ties are also expanding and strengthening. Since 1953, the two countries have sent many cultural delegations, scientific workers, artists, and other workers to each other. In 1956, Chinese artists visited Bulgaria, and the Bulgarian people were extremely happy to welcome Chinese Peking opera performers. In the same year, Bulgarian composers, artists, ballet dancers, and other personnel also visited China.

  　中保两国经济文化合作日益加强
    新华社11日讯　据保加利亚通讯社报道，保加利亚“农业旗帜报”9日报道了中国和保加利亚两国之间经济和文化合作日益加强的情况。
    报纸指出，中保两国间的经济来往是从1952年两国签订了第一个换货和支付协定之后开始的。两国间的贸易额正在不断地增加。如果以1952年为一百，那么1955年就增加到二百四十四，而1956年则增加到三百零六。报纸指出，从中国输入的某些商品在资本主义市场上只有用自由外汇才可以买得到。
    保加利亚将为中国设计两个开采和提炼铅锌矿石的工厂，并且供给它们以装备，使它们能在1959年以前开工。
    在科学技术合作方面，中保两国也保持有紧密的联系。
    在文化方面的联系也在日益扩大和加强。从1953年到现在，两国已经互相派遣了许多文化代表团、科学工作人员、艺术工作者和其他方面的工作者。1956年，中国的艺术家访问了保加利亚，保加利亚人民极高兴地欢迎了中国京剧演员。同一年，保加利亚的作曲家、艺术家、巴蕾舞演员和其他人员也访问了中国。
