Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, January 15th. A martyrs' cemetery built at the foot of Beidai Mountain on Dongtou Island, a frontline of coastal defense in eastern Zhejiang, recently held its completion ceremony. The Martyrs' Memorial in front of the cemetery is engraved with Chairman Mao Zedong's inscription: "Sacrifice for the country, immortal glory."

This martyrs' cemetery is the final resting place of 132 martyrs of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and militiamen who sacrificed their lives in the battles to defend the people of Dongtou Island and surrounding areas from August 1949 to January 1952. These battles all resulted in great victories.

In order to commemorate these martyrs, the Dongtou County People's Committee and the people of the entire county began construction of the Dongtou Island Martyrs' Cemetery last year. This martyrs' cemetery is constructed of reinforced concrete and includes a memorial monument and a memorial pavilion.
