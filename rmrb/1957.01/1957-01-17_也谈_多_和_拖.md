    Also Discussing "More" and "Procrastination"
    Zhōu Zǐ
    Comrade Ma Qianzu's article "More" and "Procrastination" (see page 7 of the People's Daily, December 17, 1956) sharply criticizes the current phenomenon of "too many heads, too many levels, and too many personnel" in our national institutions, and the resulting cumbersome procedures and "procrastinating" work style. At a time when everyone has become accustomed to it and no longer finds it strange, this short and insightful essay is indeed thought-provoking and of great educational significance.
    However, after reading the entire article, some arguments are not entirely convincing.
    Indeed, if there are "too many heads, too many levels, and too many personnel" in an institution, the procedures and formalities of work will increase accordingly, leading to the phenomenon of "procrastination." But to conclude from this that "procrastination stems from more" is somewhat one-sided; if the problem is not further addressed in terms of cadres' sense of responsibility and working methods, then even if there are fewer heads, fewer levels, and fewer personnel, the phenomenon of "procrastination" may still occur. For example, at the end of October last year, the Higher Education Department sent a document to a certain university, stipulating that a report on a student work item should be submitted before November 30th. In principle, the director of the university office only needs to present it to the president for review and then forward it to the personnel department for action. There are not many heads, not many levels, and not many personnel, so it should not "procrastinate," right? However, the director let the document rest in the drawer for more than forty days, and it was only discovered on December 17th. I think that such an irresponsible cadre, even if he is the only one, will "procrastinate today, procrastinate tomorrow, and procrastinate the day after tomorrow." For another example, some leading cadres with unclear division of labor and poor working methods insist on "circulating" matters that they could decide themselves, and even solicit opinions on the wording of meeting notices from all levels and departments. Doesn't this also create "procrastination"?
    Although Comrade Ma Qianzu's writing style is to expose the harm of "more" as the cause from the "procrastination" effect, the one-sided conclusion actually provides cover for those who are irresponsible and poor at organizing work; and it gives the impression that as long as there is no "more," work will not "procrastinate," thereby relaxing the strict requirements and ideological education of cadres. In fact, in institutions with the same amount of "more," due to the different work attitudes and methods of cadres, their "procrastination" also varies.
    Why do the various levels of institutions in our country have these three excesses?
    Comrade Ma Qianzu said: "It seems that not having many heads is not enough to speak of collective leadership. Not having many levels is not enough to speak of the grandeur of an institution. Not having many official titles is not enough to improve the enthusiasm of cadres." He also said: "If it is said that China's situation is special, we must take care of united front work and veteran cadres, and also cultivate young and new cadres..." I believe that the above situation exists, especially when the central government has repeatedly called for streamlining institutions and tightening staffing, but the old ways remain. It can indeed only be said that it is for "grandeur" and "taking care of" and "cultivating" (of course, the latter cannot be said to be entirely wrong). However, I absolutely do not believe that it is the main reason for "more." A temporary "more" also has its objective social and historical roots. That is, the work we are doing (socialist construction and transformation) is new, we lack experienced and skilled cadres, and we cannot accurately grasp the needs of the work; and the development of the work is very fast, so sometimes it is inevitable that there will be phenomena of either "more" or "less"; the Party and the government will discover and improve it each time. To set aside such a situation and make a generalized judgment that "more" is due to "grandeur" and "taking care of" and "cultivating" is also not convincing. At the same time, like the beginning of the article, saying that "more" and "procrastination" are the only two "characteristics" of our country's institutions is also somewhat blurring people's understanding of the real characteristics of national institutions.
    Shortcomings should be exposed and criticized, one can only talk about shortcomings and not advantages, and if necessary, one can also use satire to burn them away with fierce fire. However, the analysis, criticism, and conclusions drawn about shortcomings should not be one-sided. Especially in concise and logically strong essays, arguments need to be more thorough; otherwise, unfounded words cannot convince people, thereby weakening their combat effectiveness.
    Editor's Note: We have successively received some letters and articles that raise different opinions on Comrade Ma Qianzu's article "'More' and 'Procrastination'." We have selected this more representative article and published it here to give readers a more comprehensive understanding of the "more" and "procrastination" issues.

    也谈“多”和“拖”
    舟子
    马前卒同志的“多”和“拖”一文（见人民日报1956年12月17日七版），尖锐地批评了当前我们国家机关中“头多、层次多、人手多”的现象和因此产生的手续繁、工作“拖”的作风。在大家已经习以为常、见怪不怪的时候，这篇短小精悍的杂文，的确能发人深省，有很大的教育意义。
    但读完全篇，有些论点还不能使人完全心服。
    的确，机关中的“头多了，层次多了，人手多了”，工作的程序、手续就会随之增加，产生“拖”的现象。但要因此就作出“拖出于多”的结论，那就有点片面了；如果不进一步从干部的工作责任心和工作方法上解决问题，那末，即使头少了、层次少了、人手少了，“拖”的现象也未必不会出现。例如：去年10月底高等教育部给某大学去了个公文，规定在11月30日以前汇报一项学生工作。按理说，学校办公室主任只须呈校长阅后批转人事处照办就行了，头不多、层次不多、人手也不多，可以不“拖”了吧。然而不然，主任却让公文在抽屉里休息了四十多天，发觉时已经是12月17日了。像这样不负责任的干部，我想，即使只他一人，也会“今天拖、明天拖、后天还要拖的”。又如：有些分工不明、工作方法不好的领导干部，对自己本来可以决定的事，偏要“团团转地传阅”，甚至连发开会通知也要上下左右的征求文字上的意见，难道这又不产生“拖”？
    尽管马前卒同志的笔锋，是从“拖”这个果去揭发“多”这个因的为害，但是，片面的结论却在实际上为那些不负责任和不善于组织工作的人打了掩护；并给人一个印象：似乎只要不“多”了，工作也就不“拖”了，从而放松对干部的严格要求和思想教育。事实上，在同等“多”的机关中，由于干部的工作态度和工作方法不同，其“拖”也，亦各有所别的。
    我们国家的各级机关为什么会有三多？
    马前卒同志说：“看来，头不多不足以言集体领导。层次不多不足以言机关气派。官衔不多不足以提高干部的积极性。”又说：“如果说，中国情况特殊，既要照顾统战和老干部，又要培养青年和新干部……”。我相信上述情况是有的，尤其是当中央一再号召精简机构，紧缩编制之后，仍故态依然者，的确只能说是为了“气派”和“照顾”、“培养”（当然，对于后者还不能一概说不对）。但是，我也绝不相信它是“多”的主要原因。一时的“多”也有其客观的社会历史根源。这就是，我们所做的工作（社会主义的建设和改造）都是新的，缺少经验和熟练的干部，对工作的需要还不能精确掌握；而工作的发展又很快，因此有时就难免出现或“多”或“少”的现象；党和政府也就发现一次，改进一次。要撇开这样一个情况，笼统的作出“多”就是因为“气派”和“照顾”、“培养”，也不能使人心服。同时，像该文开头那样，把“多”和“拖”说成是我国机关的唯二“特色”，也是有些模糊人们对国家机关的真正特色的认识的。
    缺点，应该揭发批判，可以只谈缺点不谈优点，必要时还可以讽刺，用烈火把它烧掉。但是对缺点的分析、批判和下的结论，不应该是片面的。尤其是在言简意赅、逻辑性强的杂文里，论事更需周密；否则，言不中肯便不能服人之心，从而削弱了它的战斗性。
    编者附记：我们陆续接到一些来信来稿，对马前卒同志的“‘多’和‘拖’”一文提出不同的意见，我们选出这篇较有代表性的文章发表于此，使读者对“多”和“拖”问题有较全面的认识。
