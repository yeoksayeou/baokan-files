    The recent talks in Moscow between the government delegation of the Soviet Union and the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic have concluded. The joint statement issued by both sides on the 7th expressed unanimous views on current international issues and made specific arrangements for further enhancing the political and economic relations between the two countries. This meeting once again embodied the spirit of friendly cooperation between socialist countries and made a new contribution to strengthening the unity of socialist countries and consolidating the cause of world peace.

    In the eleven years since the people of East Germany embarked on the road of peaceful and democratic development, especially since the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, the mutual relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic have been continuously enhanced on the basis of friendly cooperation, playing an important role in the political, economic, and cultural development of the German Democratic Republic.

    In the political aspect, in contrast to the policy of splitting Germany by American, British, and French imperialism, which violated the interests of the German nation, the Soviet Union has consistently strived for the democratic unification of Germany. From the beginning, the Soviet occupation forces in Germany insisted on implementing the Potsdam Agreement of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, making it possible for democratic forces in Germany to establish a people's regime in East Germany. The German Democratic Republic, the first worker-peasant state in German history, born on October 7, 1949, is a strong fortress of peace and democracy forces in Germany.

    Fearing the consolidation and development of the German Democratic Republic, American and West German warmongers instigated fascist provocations against the democratic districts of Berlin and other places in the German Democratic Republic in June 1953. However, thanks to the resolute measures taken by the Soviet occupation authorities to help suppress the riots, the German Democratic Republic promptly stopped the criminal actions of the fascist bandits, thereby thwarting the imperialist conspiracy to subvert the worker-peasant regime of the German Democratic Republic and endanger the cause of European peace.

    In August of the same year, the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic held government talks in Berlin to discuss important issues related to the development of relations between the two countries and issues of urgent significance for the peaceful settlement of the German question. Through this meeting, the Soviet Union gave important support to the efforts of the German Democratic Republic and the entire German people to strive for peaceful unification. In March 1954, the Soviet government, taking into account the interests of the people of the German Democratic Republic, decided to establish relations with the German Democratic Republic like those with other sovereign countries and to abolish the supervision of the Soviet High Commissioner in Germany over the activities of the state organs of the German Democratic Republic. Shortly thereafter, the Soviet government decided to completely abolish the laws and regulations concerning political, economic, and cultural affairs promulgated by the Soviet occupation authorities in Germany after the war.

    The treaty between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic on relations between the two countries, signed on September 20, 1955, marked a new stage in the relations between the two countries. This treaty fixed in legal form the friendly relations established between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic on the principles of complete equality, mutual respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs. According to this treaty, the German Democratic Republic can freely resolve its internal and foreign affairs. At the same time, the Soviet government decided to abolish the post of Soviet High Commissioner in Germany. However, considering the fact that West German militarism is reviving, Western countries still retain troops stationed in West Germany, and the existence of the North Atlantic Treaty aggressive bloc, it was decided that Soviet troops would temporarily remain stationed in the German Democratic Republic. But the treaty also stipulates that these Soviet troops will not interfere in the internal affairs of the German Democratic Republic or in the social and political life of this country.

    The two government delegation talks held in Moscow last July and at the beginning of this year have further developed the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic on the basis of the treaty of relations between the two countries. The statements issued as a result of the two talks reiterated the views of the two governments on the peaceful settlement of the German issue, pointing out the realistic way to seek a reasonable solution to the German unification issue through direct consultations between East and West Germany. Regarding the issue of Soviet troops stationed in the German Democratic Republic, the most recent meeting decided that an agreement will be concluded in the near future to resolve the issues arising from the stationing of Soviet troops on the territory of the German Democratic Republic.

    The continuous development of political relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic has consolidated the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic, enhanced its international status, and encouraged the German people's confidence in striving for the democratic unification of Germany. Therefore, it not only conforms to the interests of the German people, but also to the interests of the Soviet Union and all democratic and peace-loving people.

    The German Democratic Republic has also continuously received selfless assistance from the Soviet Union in restoring its economy and carrying out socialist construction. Economic cooperation has occupied an important position in the successive important talks between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic governments.

    In the years since 1947, the Soviet Union has transferred 196 industrial enterprises, which it had accepted as German reparations under the Potsdam Agreement, to the German Democratic Republic. This is of great significance for promoting the development of the peaceful economy of the German Democratic Republic. The Soviet Union has also gradually reduced the economic and financial obligations borne by the German Democratic Republic due to the consequences of Hitler's war. According to the Soviet-German agreement on financial and economic issues in August 1953, the Soviet government abandoned all reparations, reduced the expenses of Soviet troops stationed in Germany, and relieved the German Democratic Republic of its national debt to the Soviet Union due to the consequences of the war. These measures, as well as other measures stipulated in the agreement, benefited the German Democratic Republic a total of 13.48 billion marks. Considering the fact that the Soviet Union sacrificed and lost the most in the war against German fascist aggression, one will more fully recognize the generosity and selflessness of the Soviet Union's actions towards the German people.

    For several years, the expenses paid by the German Democratic Republic to maintain the occupation forces have been continuously reduced. In 1949, this expense was more than 2.1 billion marks, and it gradually decreased thereafter, to 1.6 billion marks in 1954. According to the agreement between the two governments in July 1956, this expense was further reduced by half, that is, 800 million marks per year.

    Due to the historical characteristics of German economic development, especially due to the state of division of Germany caused by the Western occupying authorities, the German Democratic Republic must export industrial products in exchange for raw materials and food. Therefore, foreign trade plays an important role in the economic development of the German Democratic Republic. In the foreign trade of the German Democratic Republic, trade with the Soviet Union occupies a primary position. Taking 1955 as an example, in the total import volume of several economically significant imported goods of the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union supplied 95% of the mineral ore and pig iron, 100% of the copper and lead, 95% of the crude oil and cotton, and 90% of the grain. At the same time, the Soviet Union also provided a broad market for the products of the main industrial sectors of the German Democratic Republic—the machinery manufacturing industry, the electrical industry, and the optical instrument industry. For several years, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic has been continuously increasing. In the most recent meeting, the Soviet Union also decided to supply the German Democratic Republic with more than 30% more goods in 1957 than in the previous year.

    The Soviet Union also provides financial assistance to the German Democratic Republic in the form of loans. The two government talks in 1953 determined that the Soviet Union would grant the German Democratic Republic a loan of 485 million rubles. The joint statement of the July 1956 meeting determined that the Soviet Union would provide long-term credit to the German Democratic Republic on preferential terms. The most recent meeting decided to loan 340 million rubles in free foreign exchange.

    The traditional cultural ties between the Soviet and German peoples, which had been hindered by the war, have also become increasingly active with the birth of the German Democratic Republic. Mutual visits by parliamentary delegations and people from the cultural, artistic, scientific, and sports circles of the two countries have deepened mutual understanding and brotherly friendship between the two peoples.

    The Soviet government has successively transferred the cultural treasures and historical documents, which it rescued from Germany in 1945 and properly preserved, to the government of the German Democratic Republic, including: about 750 famous oil paintings from the Dresden Painting Gallery, more than 140,000 German archive documents of great historical value, and 300,000 books and manuscripts from the Gotha Library. This shows the Soviet people's respect for German people's culture and their trust in the German Democratic Republic government—the reliable successor of German cultural heritage. According to the joint statement of the two government delegations on the 7th of this month, the two sides will study the issue of mutually returning cultural treasures in the future.

    The consolidation and development of Soviet-German friendship is an important condition for the independent security and prosperous development of the German Democratic Republic, and a reliable guarantee for the cause of peace in Europe. It is an insurmountable obstacle to those imperialist aggressive forces who vainly attempt to solve the German issue by force and attempt to undermine the people's democratic system of the German Democratic Republic. As Premier Grotewohl emphasized at the reception held by Chairman Bulganin of the Soviet Council of Ministers: "The fact that we maintain close and friendly relations with the Soviet Union, a socialist and peaceful power, assures us that we will be able to successfully solve the complex and arduous tasks we face, whether in resolving the major issues of the German national struggle or in building socialism."

    苏联和民主德国友好合作的发展
    孙乃
    苏联政府代表团和德意志民主共和国政府代表团最近在莫斯科举行的会谈已经结束。双方于7日发表的联合声明中表达了对目前国际问题的一致意见，并为继续增进两国的政治和经济关系作了具体安排。这次会谈再一次体现了社会主义国家友好合作的精神，对加强社会主义阵营各国的团结和巩固世界和平的事业作出了新的贡献。
    在德国东部人民走上和平和民主发展道路的十一年来，特别是在德意志民主共和国成立以后，苏联和民主德国的相互关系在友好合作的基础上不断增进，并且对民主德国政治、经济和文化的发展起着重要的作用。
    在政治方面，同美、英、法帝国主义分裂德国、违背德国民族利益的政策相反，苏联一贯为德国的民主统一而努力。苏联驻德占领军一开始就坚持执行了苏、美、英、法四国波茨坦协定，使德国民主力量有可能在德国东部建立起人民政权。1949年10月7日诞生的德国历史上第一个工农国家——德意志民主共和国，是德国和平和民主力量的坚强堡垒。
    美国和西德好战分子害怕民主德国的巩固和发展，在1953年6月制造了对柏林民主区和民主德国其他地方的法西斯挑衅事件。但是，由于苏联占领当局坚决采取了帮助镇压暴乱的措施，德意志民主共和国及时制止了法西斯匪徒的罪恶行动，从而粉碎了帝国主义企图颠覆民主德国工农政权和危害欧洲和平事业的阴谋。
    同年8月，苏联和德意志民主共和国在柏林举行的政府会谈，讨论了有关发展两国关系的重要问题以及对和平解决德国问题具有迫切意义的问题。通过这次会谈，苏联对民主德国和全体德国人民争取和平统一的努力给了重要的支持。1954年3月，苏联政府考虑到民主德国人民的利益，决定与德意志民主共和国建立像同其他主权国家一样的关系，取消苏联驻德高级专员对德意志民主共和国国家机关的活动的监督。之后不久，苏联政府又决定完全废除苏联占领当局战后在德国颁布的有关政治、经济和文化事务的法令和条例。
    苏联和德意志民主共和国于1955年9月20日签订的关于两国关系的条约，标志着两国关系进入了一个新的阶段。这个条约把苏联和德意志民主共和国根据完全平等、互相尊重主权和互不干涉内政的原则建立起来的友好关系，用法律形式固定了下来。根据这个条约，德意志民主共和国可以自由地解决它的内政和外交问题。与此同时，苏联政府决定撤销苏联驻德高级专员一职。但是，考虑到西德军国主义正在复活、西方国家仍然保留驻西德军队的事实以及北大西洋公约侵略集团的存在，决定苏军暂时仍留驻在德意志民主共和国境内。但条约同时还规定：这些苏联驻军将不干涉德意志民主共和国的内政和这个国家的社会和政治生活。
    去年7月和今年年初苏德两国政府代表团在莫斯科举行的两次会谈，使苏联和德意志民主共和国的友好关系在两国关系条约的基础上得到了进一步的发展。两次会谈结果所发表的声明，都重申了两国政府对和平解决德国问题的意见，指出了通过东西德直接协商来谋求合理解决德国统一问题的现实道路。关于苏联驻军问题，最近的这次会谈决定，将在最近期间缔结一项协定，以解决因苏军驻留在德意志民主共和国领土上而产生的问题。
    苏联和民主德国政治关系的不断发展，巩固了德意志民主共和国的主权，提高了它的国际地位，鼓舞了德国人民争取德国民主统一的信心。因此，它不但符合德国人民的利益，而且也符合苏联以及全体民主和爱好和平人民的利益。

    德意志民主共和国在恢复经济和进行社会主义建设中也不断地得到苏联的无私援助。在苏联和民主德国政府之间的历次重要会谈中，经济合作问题占着重要地位。
    从1947年起的几年来，苏联已把它根据波茨坦协定作为德国赔偿而接受的一百九十六个工业企业移交给民主德国。这对促进民主德国和平经济的发展具有重大意义。苏联还逐步减轻了德意志民主共和国由于希特勒战争后果而担负的经济和财政义务。根据1953年8月苏德关于财政与经济问题的协议，苏联政府放弃了所有的赔偿费，减少了苏军驻德费用，解除了德意志民主共和国由于战争后果对苏联积欠的国债。这些措施以及协议规定的其他措施，使德意志民主共和国总共得益一百三十四亿八千万马克。如果考虑到苏联在反抗德国法西斯侵略战争中牺牲和损失最大这一事实，就会更加认识到苏联对德国人民的这种行动的慷慨无私。
    几年来，德意志民主共和国为维持占领军所支出的费用在不断地减低。1949年这项费用是二十一亿多马克，此后逐渐减少，到1954年减低到十六亿马克。根据两国政府1956年7月的协议，这项费用再减少一半，即每年八亿马克。
    由于德国经济发展的历史特点，特别是由于西方占领当局造成的德国分裂状态，使得德意志民主共和国必须输出工业品来换取原料和粮食。因此，对外贸易在德意志民主共和国的经济发展中起着重要作用。而在德意志民主共和国的对外贸易中，同苏联的贸易居于首要地位。以1955年为例，在德意志民主共和国的几种具有重大经济意义的进口货物的全部进口额中，矿砂和生铁的95％、铜和铅的100％、原油和棉花的95％、粮食的90％，都是苏联供给的。同时，苏联也给德意志民主共和国的主要工业部门——机器制造业、电气工业、光学仪器工业的产品提供了广阔的市场。几年来，苏联和德意志民主共和国的贸易额不断地增长。在最近这次会谈中，苏联还决定在1957年供应民主德国比上一年多30％以上的货物。
    苏联还以贷款方式给德意志民主共和国以财政上的援助。1953年的两国政府会谈曾经确定，苏联给予德意志民主共和国四亿八千五百万卢布的贷款。1956年7月会谈的联合声明确定，苏联将按优惠的条件给德意志民主共和国以长期的信贷。最近的一次会谈又决定贷给三亿四千万卢布的自由外汇。

    曾经因战争而受到阻碍的苏德两国人民传统的文化联系，也随着民主德国的诞生而日益活跃起来。两国的议会代表团和文化、艺术、科学、体育界人士的互相访问，加深了两国人民的相互了解和兄弟友谊。
    苏联政府曾先后把它在1945年从德国抢救出来并加以妥善保存的文化珍品和历史文件移交给德意志民主共和国政府，其中包括：约七百五十幅著名的德累斯顿绘画陈列馆的油画、十四万多件有重大历史价值的德国档案文件、三十万册哥塔图书馆藏书和手稿。这表明了苏联人民对德国人民文化的尊重和对民主德国政府——德国文化遗产的可靠的继承者——的信任。根据本月7日的两国政府代表团联合声明，双方今后将研究有关互相归还文化珍品的问题。
    苏德友谊的巩固和发展是德意志民主共和国独立安全和繁荣发展的重要条件，也是欧洲和平事业的可靠保证。它对那些妄想以武力来解决德国问题和企图破坏德意志民主共和国人民民主制度的帝国主义侵略势力，是一个不可克服的障碍。正如格罗提渥总理在苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁举行的招待会上所强调指出的：“我们同苏联这个社会主义和平大国保持亲密友好联系的事实，使我们确信，无论是在解决德国民族斗争的重大问题方面或是在建设社会主义方面，我们将能胜利地解决我们所面临的复杂而艰巨的任务。”
