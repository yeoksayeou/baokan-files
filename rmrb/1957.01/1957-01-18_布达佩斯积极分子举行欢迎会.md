Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 17th - The Budapest Municipal Provisional Executive Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party held a congress of Party and non-Party activists at the Construction Workers' Building on the afternoon of the 16th to welcome the Chinese Government Delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai. Approximately 1,500 people attended the congress.

President Dobi of the Hungarian People's Republic, Premier Kadar of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, and Minister of State Marosan, among others, attended the congress.

On the rostrum hung the national flags of Hungary and China, flanked by large banners written in Chinese and Hungarian: "Long Live the Solidarity of the Socialist Camp!"

The congress began with a speech by Piskutz, head of the Budapest Municipal Provisional Executive Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party. He expressed a warm welcome to the Chinese Government Delegation, at which time the hall erupted in sustained applause. After explaining the significance of the meeting, Piskutz proposed a moment of silence for the Communist Party members and other non-Party figures loyal to the cause of socialism who sacrificed themselves in the counter-revolutionary rebellion. The entire audience stood for three minutes of silence.

At the congress, Major, the manager of the National Theatre and a two-time Kossuth Prize winner, recited a poem entitled "Workers."

Then, Premier Kadar spoke (see page 2). When Kadar stepped onto the stage, the entire audience stood up to salute him. Kadar's references to the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of Hungary and China, and to the strong unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, were frequently interrupted by applause.

When Premier Zhou Enlai stepped onto the stage, the entire audience stood up to salute him, with sustained applause. When Premier Zhou Enlai spoke about the 600 million Chinese people supporting the struggle of the Hungarian people, the entire hall erupted in cheers (speech see page 2).

After Premier Zhou Enlai finished speaking, Emil Nagy, a worker at the Ganz Shipyard, Karoly Nagy, a member of the agricultural production cooperative in Bekes County, and Simo, an elementary school teacher, spoke at the meeting.

The congress concluded with the singing of the Internationale. The congress began at 4:20 PM and ended at 6:15 PM, lasting nearly two hours.
