    Lovable Tianmen Printed Cloth
    Tianmen printed cloth is an outstanding folk handicraft in Hubei Province, which was popular as early as the Qing Dynasty. In Tianmen Town alone, there were more than 100 dyeing workshops, producing and dyeing in large quantities, and selling throughout the province, deeply loved by the broad masses of working people.
    Tianmen printed cloth only has two colors, blue and white, but it can cleverly form a variety of beautiful patterns. Flowers, plants, fish, animals, figures, and landscapes are all lifelike and ready to spring to life. The composition and use of lines are very robust, simple, and full of a strong atmosphere of life.
    However, before liberation, Tianmen printed cloth suffered a fatal blow from "imported goods." More than 100 dyeing workshops closed down one after another, and only one workshop in the town barely maintained production. After liberation, a cadre from Tianmen County went to Beijing for a meeting, carrying a printed cloth quilt cover, which was discovered and highly praised by artists. Since then, the Beijing Fine Arts Service Department has been processing and ordering goods every year. In the spring of 1956 alone, 200 bolts were ordered. Among them were quilt covers, tablecloths, curtains, floral fabrics, etc., which were exhibited in the United Kingdom and France and received high praise from the people of Western Europe.

    逗人喜爱的天门印花布
    天门印花布是湖北省民间手工艺品中出色的一种，远在清代，即盛行一时。仅天门城关镇就有一百多家染坊，大量印染，行销全省各地，深为广大劳动人民所热爱。
    天门印花布只有蓝白二色，但是能巧妙地构成各色各样的美丽图案。有花草、鱼兽、人物、风景，无不栩栩如生，跃跃欲动。构图和线条的运用，都十分刚健、惇朴，富有浓郁的生活气息。
    但是，在解放前天门印花布受到了“舶来品”致命的打击。一百多家染坊先后关闭，全镇只有一家免强维持生产。解放后，天门县有一个干部到北京开会，背着一床印花被面，被艺术家发现了，大加赏赞。从此，北京美术服务部年年来加工订货。仅在1956年春季就订购了二百匹。其中有被面、台布、门帘、花布等等，先后到英国、法国展出，得到西欧人民很高的评价。（据湖北日报）
