Diversified Operations Have Prospered Agricultural Cooperatives
Zhu Xuefan

Last August, many areas of our country suffered typhoon attacks, with the coastal areas of Zhejiang suffering the most severe damage. Many towns and villages suffered significant agricultural losses due to seawater intrusion, flash floods, collapsed houses, and livestock casualties. The struggle against this fierce disaster further demonstrated the necessity and superiority of agricultural collectivization. All farmers in the disaster areas received an extremely profound education. They deeply realized that if it were not for the organized farmers, who worked together to harvest crops and protect dikes; if it were not for the Party and the government leading and supporting them in an organized manner to combat disasters and increase production, then the disaster the typhoon inflicted on the farmers would have been unimaginable. Some farmers said with gratitude: "A wind disaster unseen in a century, a good government unseen in a millennium."

Our government not only provided strong support to farmers during the emergency of the wind disaster but also promptly guided farmers to seize production after the disaster, overcome famine, strive for increased grain production, and correctly develop diversified economies to increase sideline income. In Ningbo and Shaoxing, I visited several agricultural cooperatives. Those that did well in sideline production had increased actual income for their members. The First Agricultural Cooperative in Qiu'ai Township, Ningbo, is one such example, which achieved excellent results in sideline production by correctly implementing the government's instructions.

Their sideline production mainly focuses on raising livestock and poultry. They built rows of new-style pigsties that meet general requirements in the most economical way, using bran and river grass to solve the problem of piglet feed. In addition, they also raised two thousand ducks and some chickens and geese. Vegetable production also accounts for a considerable proportion of their income. What is even more gratifying is that, in order to organize members to increase production during the winter slack season, the cooperative formulated a short-term production plan from December to the end of January before the Spring Festival. According to this small plan, it is estimated that the sideline production of vegetables, chickens, ducks, eggs, etc., can generate 13,000 yuan in two months. After deducting costs, 8,800 yuan will be distributed to the members. The cooperative has a total of 879 members, and the income from this small winter plan alone will allow each member to receive an average of ten yuan. The cooperative promptly announced this small plan to the members and carried out publicity to make them understand the significance of increasing production during the winter slack season. After the two distributions in the spring and autumn harvests last year, they can still distribute cash once before the Spring Festival in winter, which makes every member very excited. The development of sideline production has greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the members. Although this cooperative is located in a disaster area, it not only did not reduce production but, on the contrary, increased its income compared to 1955. In 1955, the average income per person was 84 yuan. In 1956, the average income per person can reach 102 yuan, and 97% of the farmers in the cooperative will increase their income.

In addition, the Ludong Cooperative in Jianhu Township, Shaoxing, which I also visited, also enabled its members to generally increase their income by paying attention to sideline production while grasping agricultural production. This cooperative made use of the characteristics of its location in a water network area to vigorously develop sideline industries such as fish and duck farming. In the fish ponds with an area of about 824 mu, the output of fresh fish alone was more than 130,000 jin, worth 27,000 yuan. They also specially built a pond to raise fish fry, cultivating 190,000 fish fry, worth 15,000 yuan. In order to meet the needs of fishery production, the cooperative organized its own net weaving production team. In addition to the fish fry pond, 520 ducks were raised in the rivers and ponds. The ducks were fattened by eating aquatic plants and miscellaneous foods, and the duck manure also fertilized the fresh fish. They also raised more than 100 pigs, as well as many chickens and geese. They brought the chickens to the harvested rice fields, letting them pick up the scattered grains. On the one hand, the chicken manure fertilized the soil, and on the other hand, it incidentally eliminated pests in the fields. The sideline income of the cooperative accounts for about one-third of the total income. 92.6% of the farmers in the cooperative increased their income compared to 1955.

The eastern part of our country has a relatively dense population, and in some places, the average land per person is only about one mu. Therefore, striving to increase the yield per unit area is important, but if we ignore the use of local natural environment and specific conditions to develop legitimate sideline industries, it will invisibly reduce the actual income of the members. This issue is particularly important in the coastal areas that have suffered more severe disasters.

I understand that there are two cooperatives in Yinxian County (Dongsheng Cooperative and Qiuyi Cooperative), only five or six li apart. Members of Qiuyi Cooperative can earn 2.15 yuan per labor day, while Dongsheng Cooperative only earns one yuan. The two cooperatives are very close, and the natural conditions are not significantly different. In contrast, the value of labor points for members differs by more than double. The main reason is the vast difference in sideline income between the two cooperatives. Some other cooperatives only have sporadic family sideline industries. The cooperatives do not engage in collective sideline industries, so they cannot exert the power of organization, and the income of the members cannot be increased either. From these situations, it is a very important link for the leaders of the cooperatives to consider how to lead the members, on the basis of doing a good job in agricultural production, to actively use the natural environment and specific conditions of the cooperative to develop legitimate sideline industries, and to strive for the economic prosperity of the agricultural cooperative from the development of diversified economies.

    多种经营繁荣了农业合作社
    朱学范
    去年8月，我国不少地区遭受台风袭击，浙江沿海地带受灾最大。好多乡镇因海水倒灌，山洪暴发，房屋倒塌，牲畜伤亡，农业上受了重大的损失。在同这场凶猛灾害斗争中，更显示出了农业集体化的必要性和优越性。所有灾区农民，都得到了一次极其深刻的教育。他们深深认识到，如果不是组织起来了的农户，大家同一步伐抢割护堤；如果不是党和政府领导他们、支援他们有组织地进行抗灾增产，那么这次台风给予农民的灾害将是不堪设想的。有些农民以感激的心情说：“百年没有的大风灾，千年没有的好政府。”
    我们的政府不但在风灾紧急的时候，给予农民大力的支持；在风灾之后，又及时地指导农民抓紧生产，战胜灾荒争取粮食增产，并正确地开展多种经济，增加副业收入。我在宁波和绍兴两地，参观了几个农业合作社，凡是副业生产搞得好的，社员的实际收入都有增加。宁波丘隘乡的第一农业社，就是由于正确地执行了政府的指示，副业生产搞得十分出色。
    这里的副业生产主要是饲养畜禽。他们以最经济的办法，建筑了一排排合乎一般要求的新式猪舍，利用糟糠与河草，解决猪仔的饲料。此外还养了二千只鸭子和一些鸡、鹅。菜蔬的生产，也在收入中占有相当的比重。更可喜的是，这个社为了组织社员利用冬闲时期增加生产，制定了一个从12月份到1月底春节前的短期生产计划，根据这个小计划，预计两个月内可以收入蔬菜、鸡、鸭、蛋品等等副业生产一万三千元。除去成本开支将有八千八百元分给社员。全体社员共八百七十九人，光是这个寒冬小计划收入，全社每口人平均就能分到十元。社里及时把这小计划向社员公布，并进行宣传，使社员了解利用冬闲增产的意义。去年春花和秋收两次分配之后，在冬季的春节之前，还能再分配一次现金，这使每个社员都非常兴奋。由于发展了副业生产，大大鼓舞了社员们的生产积极性。这个社虽然处在灾区，不仅没有减产，相反地比1955年还增加了收入。1955年平均每人收入八十四元，1956年每人平均收入可以达到一百零二元，全社将有97％的农户增加收入。
    另外，我所参观的绍兴鉴湖乡鲁东社，也是由于在抓紧农业生产的同时，重视了副业生产，因而使社员普遍增加了收入。这个社利用了它所处的水网地带的特点，大力开展养鱼养鸭等副业。在大约八百二十四亩面积的养鱼塘里，单是鲜鱼产量就有十三万多斤，价值二万七千元，还专门拦蓄一处养育鱼秧的池塘，培养成十九万尾鱼秧，价值有一万五千元。为了适应渔业生产的需要，社里自己组织了织网生产队。除了鱼秧池塘而外，河塘里还养了五百二十只水鸭，水草杂食养肥了鸭子，鸭粪也养肥了鲜鱼。他们还饲养了一百多头生猪，以及不少鸡鹅。他们把鸡带到收割后的稻田里，让鸡拾食散失的谷粒，一方面鸡粪也肥了土壤，还附带消除了田里的害虫。社里的副业收入，约占全部收入的三分之一。全社有92.6％的农户比1955年增加了收入。
    我们国家东部人口比较稠密，好些地方每口人的平均土地只有一亩左右。因此，争取增加单位面积产量固然重要，但是如果忽略了利用本地自然环境和具体条件来开展正当副业，就会在无形中减少了社员的实际收入。尤其是受灾较重的沿海地区，这个问题显得更加重要。
    我了解鄞县有两个社（东升社和丘一社），相距仅仅五、六里，丘一社社员每个劳动日可得二元一角五分，而东升社仅有一元。两社近在咫尺，自然条件并没有显著不同，相形之下，社员劳动工分价值却相差一倍之多，主要原因就是两社副业收入多寡悬殊。另有些社，只有零星的家庭副业，社里没有集体搞副业，也就发挥不出组织起来的力量，社员收入同样不能有所增加。从这些情况来看，社的领导上对于怎样领导社员，在搞好农业生产的基础上，积极利用本社的自然环境和具体条件开展正当的副业，从发展多种经济中争取农业社的经济繁荣，是一个十分重要的环节。
