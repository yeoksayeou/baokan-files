    Jiangsu's Total Agricultural and Sideline Production Value This Year to Increase by 19% Compared to Last Year
    The Current Urgent Task is to Launch a Large-Scale Production Increase Campaign and Prepare for Spring Plowing
    (Our Newspaper) According to reports, the key to achieving this year's production increase target lies in strengthening the leadership over agricultural production and the cooperative movement, promoting the socialist enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, and launching a vigorous agricultural production increase campaign. This was stated by Yu Ke, Director of the Rural Work Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at the Fourth District Committee Secretary Conference of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee.
    Based on the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Committee, Comrade Yu Ke put forward preliminary opinions on Jiangsu Province's agricultural production increase tasks and targets for 1957. He said that Jiangsu Province's agricultural production increase task for 1957 is to prioritize the development of grain crops while also taking into account cotton and other cash crops, and developing a diversified economy. The preliminary planned production increase targets are: grain (including soybeans) 27.5 billion to 28 billion jin, cotton 4.5 million to 5 million dan, oil crops 900 million to 1 billion jin, and live pigs 8.6 million to 10 million heads. The total output value of agricultural and sideline products should increase by 19% compared to last year, of which the total output value of sideline products is required to account for 30% of the total output value of agricultural and sideline products.
    Comrade Yu Ke then pointed out: The above indicators are positive, reliable, and achievable. Of course, there are still certain difficulties in the production increase work in 1957. Especially from the current winter and spring production perspective, some areas still have serious disasters, and drought has appeared. Many agricultural cooperatives are busy with final distribution and lack proper arrangements for winter and spring production. The winter production campaign has not yet formed a climax, resulting in uneven emergence or no emergence of wheat in 30% of the area. Small-scale winter water conservancy repairs and fertilizer accumulation work have not reached the required levels. These have certain adverse effects on this year's agricultural production increase. However, there are more favorable conditions for agricultural production increase this year. The water conservancy projects that have been completed and are about to be completed will further improve the province's flood control and drainage situation; crop planting and diversified economies have already laid a certain foundation; although the foundation for this year's summer-ripening crops is relatively poor, it is much better than the situation in 1954 after the disaster, where some land was abandoned and sowing was delayed; especially, agriculture in the province has achieved advanced cooperativization, and the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives have undergone a year of production struggle, and a large number of excellent grassroots backbones have emerged and been cultivated. Leading cadres at all levels have gained richer experience in production and are further changing their work style and improving their leadership. With the development of industrialization, the state will continue to provide great support to agriculture. All these positive factors will play a huge role in this year's agricultural production increase. Since 1955 was able to achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest after the extraordinarily heavy flood in 1954, it is entirely possible to strive to achieve this year's production increase target with more favorable conditions in all aspects than in the past.
    After analyzing the specific conditions for completing the agricultural production increase task in 1957, he talked in detail about the main ways to increase agricultural production in Jiangsu Province in the future. He said that according to seven years of experience, the main ways to increase agricultural production in the province in the future are: to implement intensive cultivation on existing cultivated land and strive to increase the yield per unit area; at the same time, on the premise of doing a good job in agricultural production, to develop a diversified economy and enable the entire rural economy to achieve comprehensive development. How to increase agricultural output per unit area? Doing a good job in the cultivation of existing crops is the foundation for completing the agricultural production increase plan, and it is also a direction for gradually increasing the output per unit area; at the same time, it has also become increasingly clear that actively and steadily implementing the reform of the cultivation system, developing high-yield crops, and increasing the multiple cropping index have gradually become the main ways to increase output per unit area and ensure agricultural production increase in a certain period in the future. Of course, doing a good job in the cultivation of original crops is still the foundation of the entire agricultural production. It would be very dangerous to focus solely on reforming the cultivation system.
    In order to achieve the agricultural production increase target for 1957, in terms of doing a good job in the cultivation of existing crops, we must focus on improving cultivation techniques and do a good job in timely planting, dense planting for full emergence, popularizing improved varieties, and strengthening field management. In terms of reforming the cultivation system, we should focus on converting dry land to paddy fields, combined with other work. The results of reforming the cultivation system in 1956 proved that converting dry land to paddy fields can not only increase production but also be very cost-effective in terms of economic benefits. However, converting dry land to paddy fields must have a reliable water source, implement continuous planting, and also take into account the labor situation. There are 14 million mu of dry land in the province that can be developed for rice cultivation, and it is planned to convert 10 million mu of dry land into paddy fields in the next three to five years. The focus of converting dry land to paddy fields is on the Xu-Huai dry land area north of the irrigation canal. In 1957, the province plans to convert 2 million mu of dry land into paddy fields. The results of trial planting of double-cropping rice last year proved that in the northern Jiangsu area south of the irrigation canal and west of the Banchang River, and in the entire southern Jiangsu area, using one-crop fields to develop double-cropping rice, as long as the planting area does not exceed 15% of the total rice area, and each laborer's burden does not exceed one mu of land, it is beneficial to increasing grain output and enlivening the rural economy. In 1957, it is planned to develop another 400,000 mu of double-cropping rice on the basis of last year's 630,000 mu. The production increase effect of converting indica rice to japonica rice is also good, and it is also cost-effective in terms of economic benefits. However, japonica rice is generally a water-resistant, fertilizer-resistant, and longer-growing crop, so its requirements for production conditions are generally higher. If japonica rice is blindly converted without regard to conditions, it will also lead to reduced production. In 1957, the province plans to continue converting 4 million mu of indica rice to japonica rice. The planting area of three wheats should also be appropriately expanded. In order to adapt to the development of rice and wheat and increase cotton production, a portion of cotton should also be developed in the Xu-Huai area. When developing rice and cotton, attention should be paid to preserving high-yield coarse grains as much as possible, especially to coarse millet and sweet potatoes, and other coarse grains should not be blindly squeezed out, and the planting area of oil crops must be guaranteed. In order to achieve rational planting, all localities should pay attention to the rational allocation of early, medium, and late varieties of major crops, and especially take into account the economic life of the masses to prevent one-sidedness.
    Finally, Comrade Yu Ke pointed out that in order to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the agricultural production increase target for 1957, we must seize the opportunity, boost our energy, and launch a vigorous agricultural production increase campaign. We must vigorously build water conservancy projects, complete various large-scale water conservancy projects on schedule, and actively carry out small-scale farmland water conservancy projects to achieve greater benefits than in 1956. In addition to fundamentally relying on pig raising, planting green manure, and increasing the accumulation of miscellaneous fertilizers, we must launch a widespread fertilizer accumulation campaign before spring plowing. We must continue to carry out drought resistance and seedling protection campaigns, strengthen technical guidance, and effectively solve the manufacturing and supply of production materials. While doing a good job in agricultural production, we must also pay attention to developing a diversified economy.

    江苏今年农副业总产值要比去年增加19％
    目前的紧要任务是开展大规模的增产运动做好春耕准备工作
    本报讯　实现今年增产任务的关键，在于加强对农业生产和合作化运动的领导，发扬干部和群众的社会主义积极性，展开一个热火朝天的农业增产运动。这是中共江苏省委农村工作部部长余克最近在江苏省委第四次区委书记会议上发言中所讲的。
    余克同志根据中央和省委的指示精神，提出了江苏省1957年的农业增产任务和增产指标的初步意见。他说，江苏省1957年的农业增产任务，是尽先发展粮食作物，同时照顾棉花和其他经济作物，发展多种经济。初步规划的增产指标是：粮食（包括大豆）二百七十五亿斤到二百八十亿斤，棉花四百五十万担到五百万担，油料九亿斤到十亿斤，生猪八百六十万头到一千万头。农副业总产值较去年增加19％，其中副业总产值要求达到占农副业总产值30％。
    余克同志接着指出：上述指标是积极可靠的，也是可以完成的。当然1957年的增产工作中还有一定的困难，特别是从当前冬春生产来看，部分地区还有严重的灾荒，又出现干旱现象，不少农业社忙于决分，对冬春生产缺乏妥善安排，冬季生产运动还没有形成高潮，以致麦子有30％出苗不齐和没有出苗，小型水利冬修和积肥工作还没有达到应有要求。这些对今年的农业增产都有一定不利的影响。但是，今年农业增产中的有利条件更多，那就是目前已经完成和即将完成的水利工程，将进一步改善全省的防洪排涝情况；作物种植和多种经济都已打下一定的基础；今年夏熟作物基础虽较差，但比1954年受灾以后部分土地抛荒和播种失时的情况要好得多；特别是全省农业已经实现高级合作化，绝大多数农业社经过一年来生产斗争的锻炼，涌现出和培养了大批优秀的基层骨干，各级领导干部在生产中取得了更为丰富的经验，并正在进一步改变作风和改进领导。随着工业化的发展，国家对农业将继续给以很大的支持。所有这些积极因素都将在今年农业增产中发挥巨大的作用。1955年既然能在遭到特大洪水的1954年之后，获得空前丰收；那么今年各方面条件比过去更为优越，力争实现今年的增产任务，也是完全可能的。
    他在分析了完成1957年农业增产任务的具体条件之后，详尽地谈到了江苏省今后农业增产的主要途径。他说，根据七年来的经验，今后本省农业增产的主要途径是：对现有耕地实行精耕细作，努力提高单位面积产量；同时在搞好农业生产的前提下，发展多种经济，使整个农村经济得到全面的发展。如何提高农业单位面积产量呢？搞好现有作物栽培，是完成农业增产计划的基础，也是逐步提高单位产量的一个方向；同时，也越来越明显地证实，积极而又稳步地实行耕作制度的改革，发展高产作物，提高复种指数，已逐渐成为今后一定时期提高单位面积产量、保证农业增产的主要途径。当然，首先搞好原有作物的栽培工作还是整个农业生产的基础，如果孤立地抓改革耕作制度，那是十分危险的。
    为了实现1957年的农业增产指标，在搞好原有作物的栽培工作方面，要以改进耕作技术为中心，做好适时种植、密植全苗、推广良种、加强田间管理等工作；在改革耕作制度方面，应以旱地改水田为重点，结合进行其他工作。1956年改革耕作制度的结果证明，旱地改水田不仅可以增产，而且在经济收益上也很合算。但是，进行旱地改水田必须具备可靠的水源，实行连片种植，还要照顾到劳力的情况。本省有一千四百万亩旱田可以发展水稻，计划在今后三、五年内，把一千万亩旱地改成水田。旱地改水田的重点放在灌溉总渠以北的徐淮旱田地区。1957年全省计划旱地改水田二百万亩。去年试种双季稻的结果证明：在灌溉总渠以南、半场河以西苏北地区和整个苏南地区，利用一熟田发展双季稻，只要种植面积不超过水稻总面积的15％，每个劳力负担不超过一亩田，对于增加粮食产量，活跃农村经济生活，都是有好处的。在1957年，计划在去年六十三万亩的基础上，再发展四十万亩双季稻。籼稻改粳稻的增产效果也是好的，经济收益上也是合算的。但是，粳稻一般都是耐水、耐肥、生长期较长的作物，因而对生产条件的要求一般也较高，如果不问条件盲目改种粳稻，也会造成减产。1957年，全省计划继续籼改粳四百万亩。三麦种植面积也要适当扩大。为了适应发展稻麦和提高棉花产量，还要在徐淮地区发展一部分棉花；在发展水稻、棉花时，要注意尽量保存高产杂粮，特别要照顾到杂谷和山芋，也不能盲目排挤其他的杂粮，并要保证油料作物的播种面积。为做到合理种植，各地对主要作物的品种安排，应注意早、中、晚的合理搭配，特别要照顾群众的经济生活，防止片面性。
    最后，余克同志指出，为确保完成和超额完成1957年的农业增产指标，必须抓紧时机，鼓起劲头，开展一个热火朝天的农业增产运动。要大力兴修水利，如期完成各项大型水利工程，并积极地开展小型农田水利，收到比1956年更大的效益。除从根本上依靠养猪、种植绿肥和增积杂肥外，在春耕以前，开展一个广泛性的积肥运动。必须继续开展抗旱救苗运动，加强技术指导，有效的解决生产资料的制造和供应问题。在搞好农业生产的同时，还要注意发展多种经济。
