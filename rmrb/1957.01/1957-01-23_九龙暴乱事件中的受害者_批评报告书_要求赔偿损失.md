Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 22nd: Hong Kong sources report that factory, school, and store managers who suffered losses in the Kowloon riots last October have issued criticisms of the "Report on the Riots in Kowloon and Tsuen Wan" published by the British Hong Kong authorities.

    Deng Xingchu, General Manager of Guangzhou Steel Window Manufacturing Co., said: It is obvious that the Kowloon riots were instigated by Kuomintang secret agents, but the report does not explicitly point this out. We hope that the British Hong Kong authorities will face the facts and severely punish the perpetrators. Huang Peiqiu, manager of Nanhua Toy Metal Products Factory, as a victim, demanded that the British Hong Kong authorities effectively guarantee the safety of life and property of Hong Kong residents. Zhuang Chengzong, the person in charge of Oriental Soy Sauce Company, said: The most important thing now is to severely punish the criminals and pursue the masterminds. If this is not dealt with thoroughly this time, and instead it is said that "danger still exists," it will make people panic and have a great impact on Hong Kong's business community and residents.

    The principals of Yihe Tai, Shengji and other affected cloth factories in Kowloon City used the experiences of their factories being attacked to prove that the rioters acted in a planned manner. They said: The Governor of Hong Kong's statement in his letter that "there is no evidence sufficient to consider the Kowloon riots as premeditated" is incomplete.

    The Great Wall Movie Enterprise suffered wanton sabotage by Kuomintang secret agents and rioters. The person in charge of this film studio said: What we are most concerned about is how the British Hong Kong authorities will eliminate the source of the chaos, arrest the masterminds and bring them to justice, and how to ensure safety so that the peaceful lives of manufacturers and residents can be guaranteed in the future. However, the report published by the Hong Kong authorities lacks satisfactory conclusions on both of these points. They hope that the Hong Kong authorities can make further conclusions on this and express their determination to prevent future occurrences with concrete follow-up measures. The person in charge of Popular Bookstore expressed regret over the Hong Kong authorities' statement that "danger still exists."

    The person in charge of Heung To Middle School stated in a written statement published in Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po on the 17th that the British Hong Kong authorities' consideration of compensating residents for losses suffered in the Kowloon riots is also a consideration of assuming their due responsibility. Heung To Middle School was attacked and set on fire by Kuomintang rioters, with total losses, including building repair costs, amounting to approximately HK$320,000. After the riots, they filed a claim for compensation with the Hong Kong Police Force. They hope that this compensation can be allocated as soon as possible so that they can do a better job of repairing the school buildings. The person in charge of the school also hoped in the written statement that the British Hong Kong authorities would punish the mastermind who instigated the rioters to burn down the school and take effective measures to protect the safety of residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

    九龙暴乱事件中的受害者
    批评报告书　要求赔偿损失
    新华社广州22日电　香港消息：在去年10月九龙暴乱事件中受害的工厂、学校和商店的负责人纷纷就香港英国当局发表的“九龙及荃湾暴动报告书”发表了批评意见。
    广州钢窗制造有限公司总经理邓兴初说：九龙暴乱事件是国民党特务所策动，这是有目共睹的，但报告书中没有明确指出这一点。我们希望香港英国当局正视事实，认真惩凶。南华玩具金属制品厂经理黄佩球以受害者的身份要求香港英国当局切实地保证香港居民生命财产的安全。东方酱油公司的负责人庄成宗说：目前最重要的是严惩凶犯，追缉元凶，这次如果不能彻底处理，反而说“危险仍常存在”，则使人心惶惶，对香港商场和居民的影响很大。
    九龙城义和泰、生记等受害布厂的主事人，以他们布厂受袭经过证明暴徒是有计划行事的，他们说：香港总督的信里关于九龙暴乱事件“并无任何证供，足以谓之为有事先预谋”的说法是不全面的。
    长城电影制片厂曾被国民党特务分子和暴徒肆意捣乱，这家制片厂的负责人说：我们最关切的是香港英国当局将如何杜绝乱源，缉拿元凶归案严办；并如何确保安全，使厂商居民今后的和平生活获得保障。可是香港当局发表的报告书对以上两点却都缺乏足以令人欣慰的结论。他们希望香港当局对此能作出进一步的结论，并以具体的善后办法来表示对今后防范的决心。大众书局负责人对香港当局的“危险仍常存在”这一说法表示遗憾。
    香岛中学负责人17日曾在香港文汇报发表书面谈话说，香港英国当局考虑赔偿在九龙暴乱事件中居民所受的损失，也就是考虑负起应负的责任。香岛中学曾被国民党暴徒袭击纵火，全部损失连同建筑物修理费包括在内，共达港币三十二万元左右。在暴乱事件之后，他们曾向香港警务处提出赔偿损失的要求。他们希望这笔赔款及早拨出来，使他们修复校舍的工作做得更圆满。该校负责人书面谈话还希望香港英国当局对主使暴徒焚烧该校的祸首予以惩办，并采取有效措施保障港九居民的安全。
