Xinhua News Agency report:

    Anhui Province's Party and government organs at all levels are strengthening their leadership over disaster relief work, helping disaster victims overcome the rain, snow, and severe cold.

    In the Huaibei area of ​​Fuyang Prefecture, more than 1,500 cadres have been sent to rural areas to inspect disaster relief work. In the seriously affected area of ​​Yingshang County, each agricultural cooperative has three to five cadres to help with the work. In the disaster-stricken districts and townships of ​​Bengbu Prefecture, with the exception of one person staying behind to grasp the overall situation, the remaining cadres have gone deep into the cooperatives to carry out door-to-door disaster investigation and relief work. The three prefectures of Wuhu, Anqing, and Lu'an have also sent a large number of cadres to rural areas to investigate and provide disaster relief.

    In the disaster investigation work in various places, problems are promptly resolved. During the disaster investigation in Fengyang County, it was discovered that the Huaidong and Linfeng agricultural cooperatives lacked cattle fodder and rations, so they immediately issued more than 2,000 yuan in relief funds to these two agricultural cooperatives. Zhou Zhengfa, the propaganda committee member of the Communist Party of China's Madian District Committee in Fuyang County, and four others discovered that 24 households receiving the "Five Guarantees" in the Fudong Fifteenth Agricultural Cooperative lacked firewood, so they personally braved the rain and snow to carry 780 catties of coal from seven miles away.

    While dispatching cadres to the countryside, various places have also allocated a large amount of relief funds, grain, and coal. In order to rush the transportation of disaster relief materials, employees of the transportation department broke ice and swept snow, persisting in operations. A unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Nanjing, Bengbu, and other places also dispatched more than 100 vehicles to participate in the rush transportation of disaster relief materials.

    Due to continuous rain and snow, outdoor sideline production in the disaster areas is facing many difficulties, and some have already stopped. Now, various places are actively helping disaster victims carry out indoor sideline production. The enterprise departments of He County have helped farmers solve the difficulty of raw materials for sideline production, enabling dozens of sugar mills, flour mills, and tofu workshops to maintain production, and organized more than 700 people to weave reed mats. The daily income from these sideline productions can maintain the lives of 4,000 people for one day.

    安徽干部深入农村救灾
    据新华社讯　安徽省各级党政机关加强对救灾工作的领导，帮助灾民渡过雨雪严寒。
    淮北阜阳专区已派出一千五百多个干部下乡检查救灾工作。重灾区颍上县的每个农业社都有干部三人至五人帮助工作。蚌埠专区有灾的区乡，除留一人掌握全面情况外，其余的干部都已深入到社进行挨门逐户的查灾救灾工作。芜湖、安庆、六安三个专区也已派出大批干部下乡查灾救灾。
    各地在查灾工作中，发现问题都能及时加以解决。凤阳县在查灾中发现淮东、临峰两个农业社缺牛草和口粮，就立即给这两个农业社发放了二千多元救济款。中共阜阳县马店区委会宣传委员周正法等五人，发现阜东第十五农业社有二十四个五保户缺柴烧，就亲自冒着雨雪到七里路以外的地方给他们挑来了七百八十斤煤炭。
    各地在派出干部下乡的同时，还增拨了大批的救济款和粮食、煤炭。为了抢运救灾物资，交通运输部门的员工破冰扫雪，坚持运行。驻南京、蚌埠等地的中国人民解放军某部也抽出一百多辆汽车，参加抢运救灾物资。
    由于雨雪连绵，灾区的室外副业生产困难很多，有的已经停顿。现在各地正积极帮助灾民开展室内副业生产。和县的企业部门帮助农民解决了副业原料的困难，使几十座糖坊、粉坊和豆腐坊坚持了生产，并组织了七百多人编织芦席。这些副业生产每天的收益，可以维持四千人一天的生活。
