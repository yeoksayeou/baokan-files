Xinhua News Agency, January 16th -- According to TASS, Cairo, January 15th: Egyptian newspapers published the foreign policy section of the speech by First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), Khrushchev, at the joint meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, the Council of Ministers of the Republic, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan on the occasion of the award ceremony, on the first page. The newspapers particularly pointed out that the Soviet Union supports Egypt and other Arab countries that are defending their national independence and sovereignty. The newspapers wrote that the Soviet Union provides selfless assistance to the Arab people and does not seek any interests in Arab countries.

    "Al-Ahram" published a banner headline on the front page: "The Soviet Union Helps Arabs Defend Their Independence." "Al-Ahram" also specifically mentioned Khrushchev's statement: "The sole purpose of the 'Eisenhower Doctrine' is to replace British and French imperialism with American imperialism in the Middle East. The imperialists are plundering the oil of the Middle East and the natural wealth of the Arab countries."

    "Al Shaab" published an abstract of Khrushchev's speech, with the headline: "The British Lion Lost Its Power After Being Defeated in Egypt. The Eisenhower Plan is Doomed to Failure. Russia Has No Intentions in the Middle East. It was Britain, France, and Israel that Aggressed Against Egypt." The newspaper emphasized that the Soviet Union supports the national cause of Egypt and all Arab countries.

    "Al-Gomhouria" published Khrushchev's remarks about the unshakable strength and durability of the Soviet socialist system. The newspaper said that since the establishment of the Soviet regime, there have been many different doctrines against the Soviet Union, but these doctrines have all failed. The Soviet Union still stands as firm as a rock, and its strength is growing, its economy is flourishing, and the living standards of its people are continuously improving.

    苏联帮助阿拉伯国家捍卫独立主权
    埃及各报重视赫鲁晓夫演说
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社开罗15日讯：埃及各报在第一版刊载了苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫在乌兹别克共和国最高苏维埃、共和国部长会议和乌兹别克共产党中央委员会联合举行的授勋大会上的演说的外交政策部分。各报特别指出，苏联支持埃及和支持正在捍卫自己民族独立和主权的其他阿拉伯国家。报纸写道，苏联给予阿拉伯人民以无私的援助，它不在阿拉伯国家寻求任何利益。
      “金字塔报”在第一版上刊登的通栏大标题是：“苏联帮助阿拉伯人捍卫自己的独立”。“金字塔报”还特别提到赫鲁晓夫所说的这样一句话：“艾森豪威尔主义”的唯一目的就是在中东用美国帝国主义代替英法帝国主义，帝国主义者在掠夺中东的石油和阿拉伯国家的自然财富。
    “人民报”刊载了赫鲁晓夫的演说摘要，并且加上这样的标题：“不列颠狮子在埃及受挫之后失去了它的势力。艾森豪威尔计划注定要失败。俄国对中东没有任何企图。侵略埃及的是英国、法国和以色列”。这家报纸强调指出，苏联支持埃及和所有阿拉伯国家的民族事业。
    “共和国报”刊载了赫鲁晓夫所说的关于苏维埃社会主义制度不可动摇的坚固性和持久性的话。这家报纸说，从苏维埃政权建立以来，曾经出现过许许多多各种各样反对苏联的主义，但是这些主义都失败了。苏联还是如同岩壁一样地屹立不动，并且它的力量日益强大，经济日益繁荣，人民的生活福利水平日益获得提高。
