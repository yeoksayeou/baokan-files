Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee concluded its discussion on the Korean issue on the 8th. The United States, using its voting machine, got the committee to pass one of its proposals. This proposal merely reiterates some "basic principles" previously put forward by Western countries with the aim of hindering the resolution of the Korean issue, such as holding "free elections" in Korea under the supervision of the United Nations, one of the belligerent parties in Korea.

The voting result was: 57 votes in favor, 8 votes against, and 13 abstentions. The Soviet Union and the People's Democracies voted against, and Yemen, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Burma, Ceylon, Egypt, Finland, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Syria abstained.

During the committee's discussion, Polish representative Katz-Suchy pointed out that the Korean issue cannot be resolved correctly by using force, but only through negotiations. He said that it was particularly regrettable that representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had not been invited to participate in the discussion again. The question of the reunification of Korea primarily concerns the Korean people themselves, and this question cannot be resolved without the consent of both North and South Korea.

Katz-Suchy called on the United Nations to facilitate the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, encourage economic cooperation between the North and South, and promote the signing of agreements on population transfers so that families separated during the war could be reunited. He also suggested convening a conference of relevant countries to promote the reunification of Korea.

Soviet representative Tsarapkin pointed out that the United States was attempting to resolve the Korean issue on the basis of its own plan and manipulated the United Nations voting machine to pass resolutions. However, the United States' attempts have not achieved good results. Facts show that it is impossible to resolve the Korean issue by using the force of foreign interventionists or by passing resolutions through the United Nations, or by adopting decisions on the Korean issue that the Korean people cannot agree to.

Tsarapkin emphasized that, in the Soviet view, the correct way to resolve the issue of Korean reunification is to maintain the state of armistice, transform the armistice into a lasting peace, and gradually normalize the political, economic, and cultural ties between North and South Korea.

Indian representative Menon said that "the task proposed by the American proposal is unlikely to achieve the desired goal." He said that no action should be taken that "could deepen divisions." Although the majority hope to deal with only one Korea, "in reality, there are two entities, two countries, or two governments."

Menon pointed out that UN supervision of "free elections" in Korea is "impossible to achieve." The issue of what kind of institutions Koreans elect candidates into "must be negotiated by both sides." India has been trying to encourage preliminary negotiations between the two sides, "even informally."

Menon said that because India's views are inconsistent with the American proposal, "we have to sit there and not participate in the vote. In this way, we will not bear any responsibility for what the majority considers appropriate."

After the vote on the American proposal, the committee announced an indefinite adjournment because, at the suggestion of the United States, the General Assembly decided to re-discuss the "Hungarian issue" on the 9th.

### 波苏印等国代表在联大政委会上表示  解决朝鲜问题必须通过谈判  美国操纵表决机器通过了破坏性的美国提案

    波苏印等国代表在联大政委会上表示
    解决朝鲜问题必须通过谈判
    美国操纵表决机器通过了破坏性的美国提案
    新华社9日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会8日结束了朝鲜问题的讨论。美国利用表决机器，使委员会通过了它的一个提案。这个提案只是重申西方国家过去提出的目的在于阻碍解决朝鲜问题的一些“基本原则”，例如要在朝鲜交战一方联合国的监督下在朝鲜举行“自由选举”等。
    表决的情况是：五十七票赞成，八票反对，十三票弃权。投反对票的是苏联和人民民主国家，弃权的是也门、南斯拉夫、阿富汗、缅甸、锡兰、埃及、芬兰、印度、印度尼西亚、约旦、沙特阿拉伯、苏丹和叙利亚。
    在委员会讨论过程中，波兰代表卡茨—苏希指出，要正确地解决朝鲜问题是不能使用武力的，而只能通过谈判的方式。他说，特别使人感到遗憾的是，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表这次又没有被邀请来参加讨论。关于统一朝鲜的问题首先涉及朝鲜人民自己，这个问题没有得到南、北朝鲜双方的同意是不可能解决的。
    卡茨—苏希吁请联合国促成一切外国部队从朝鲜撤出，鼓励朝鲜南、北两部分进行经济合作，促成签订居民移居的协定，以便使那些在战争期间失散了的家庭能够团聚。他同时还建议召开有关国家的会议以促成朝鲜的统一。
    苏联代表查拉普金指出，美国企图在它自己的计划的基础上解决朝鲜问题，它操纵联合国表决机器通过决议，但是，美国的企图并没有收到良好的效果。事实说明，用外国干涉者的武力或者用通过联合国的决议，用通过朝鲜人民所不能同意的关于朝鲜问题的决定的方法来解决朝鲜问题，都是不能成功的。
    查拉普金强调说，按照苏联的看法，解决统一朝鲜问题的正确途径是维持停战的状况，使停战转变为持久和平，同时逐步地使南、北朝鲜之间的政治、经济和文化联系走上正常轨道。
    印度代表梅农说，“美国提案所提出的任务不大可能达到希望达到的目标。”他说，不应该采取任何“可能加深分歧”的行动。尽管大多数希望只和一个朝鲜打交道，“实际上却存在两个单位、两个国家或者两个政府。”
    梅农指出，联合国监督朝鲜的“自由选举”是“不可能做到的”。在朝鲜把候选人选入什么样的机构问题“必须由两方协商”。印度一直在设法鼓励双方进行初步谈判，“甚至是非正式的”。
    梅农说，因为印度的意见同美国提案不一致，所以“我们只好坐在那里不参加表决。这样，我们就根本不会对大多数认为是适当的办法负任何责任”。
    在对美国提案进行表决以后，委员会宣布无限期休会，因为在美国建议下，大会决定在9日重新讨论“匈牙利问题”。
