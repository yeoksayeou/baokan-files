    The Bohai Agricultural Cooperative in Funing County was once known throughout Hebei for harvesting the most grain. People wanted to know if they harvested more grain after running an advanced cooperative than they did as a primary cooperative. I went there with this in mind. When I arrived, the cooperative was experiencing two major upsurges: one was autumn plowing and manure collection, and the other was selling grain to the state. Outside the village, plowing cattle were everywhere, and more than half of the arable land had been tilled. In the pigsties of the cooperative members, more than 300 pigs had been added in the past three days, a significant measure for collecting manure. Every day, convoys of grain-laden carts set off early. In 1955, these more than 3,000 households sold more than 4.8 million jin of public grain and surplus grain; in 1956, production increased, and they sold 7 million jin of surplus grain. In addition, they sold more than 280,000 jin of peanuts and cotton to the state.
    On more than 40,000 mu of land, people worked approximately 800,000 labor days, 60% more than in 1955, and the compensation for each labor day reached 1.30 yuan. During the time of the primary cooperative, no more than 80% of the total households increased their income. In 1956, 92% of the households increased their income.
    I visited several families and saw the tremendous changes that had taken place in the lives of the people here in one year. The old wife of the shepherd Bai Rong was blinded by the hardships of the past. When I went to see this old woman, she said with a smile, "I don't lack anything else, I just lack a daughter-in-law." If I were to say that a family like this could sell more than 10,000 jin of grain, people probably wouldn't believe it, but it is a real fact. There are three laborers in this family of four. Bai Rong is in charge of herding sheep in the cooperative. He and one of his sons spend a total of three months of the year facing the sea breeze and rainstorms, carrying food and cookware on their backs, living day and night with the sheep on the beach grassland. Their flock of sheep has grown from dozens to hundreds. In 1956, he and his two sons worked more than 800 labor days, with total income converted to more than 14,000 jin of grain. When Bai Rong summarized the changes in his life, he said, "After joining the cooperative, I ate my fill in the first year, wore new clothes in the second year, and got new quilts and lived in a new house in the third year." His family will soon move into a new three-room house.
    From the cooperative member Cao Dianxi, one can see how great the ideological changes in a person can be in one year. Before joining the cooperative, Cao Dianxi was a middle peasant with a new cart and a large mule. When the primary cooperative was established, someone advised him to join, but he said, "Your land was divided by raising your fists, my land was earned with sweat, I won't do it." In the winter of 1955, the high tide of advanced cooperation came, and he gritted his teeth, sold his large mule worth more than 500 yuan, and exchanged it for an old cow, joining the cooperative "with the wind." Because he was good at raising livestock, he was assigned as a breeder. At first, he only added grass and feed to his own cow, and didn't care about the other livestock. If anyone made his cow sweat a little, he would scold them behind their backs. A cooperative cadre said, "Judging from his appearance at the time, as long as he caught a little mistake in the cooperative, he would pull his old cow and go it alone." Although his mood was not high, because his son and daughter-in-law worked hard, after the autumn harvest distribution, his family's income still increased by more than 5,000 jin of grain compared to when he was working alone in 1955. This was something that Cao Dianxi never expected. Now, he is full of smiles all day long. Recently, the team added a new horse, and he is going to take out the livestock splints that he left behind when he joined the cooperative, preparing to use them after he withdrew from the cooperative, and use them on the new horse. He said, "One of my legs that was standing outside the cooperative has come in."
    Before liberation, on the streets of the countryside, one often saw blind people selling songs and begging for food. There were also such people here, one called Sun Guicheng and the other called Chen Ping. The same experiences made these two people of different origins and different surnames become friends in adversity. They used to beg for food along the street and shed tears together at night. The advanced cooperative changed their lives. According to the cooperative regulations, each of them received enough grain, firewood, clothing and bedding, as well as pocket money, totaling 86 yuan. They voluntarily went to the production team to help chop grass, and each earned more than 20 yuan in labor remuneration, and they no longer felt lonely. In the evening, they often sang self-composed tunes to the people who gathered around them, expressing their happy feelings.
    The Bohai Cooperative summarized a year's worth of experiences and lessons. The cooperative members always remembered the excellent work they did in production in 1956: more fertilizer was applied, about five carts of fertilizer per mu. A canal 18 li long was dug, turning more than 2,500 mu of dry land on the north bank of Bohai into rice paddies, yielding more than 500 jin of rice per mu; and more than 500 mu of weedy sandy beaches were transformed into good land for planting peanuts, harvesting more than 100,000 jin of peanuts. The more than 800 mu of small pieces of wasteland reclaimed by the cooperative members were not a small matter either, these small pieces of wasteland also produced more than 300,000 jin of rice and oil. Of the cooperative's 41,000 mu of land, more than 27,000 mu were planted with Baimaya and Jin Queen corn. According to the technicians' statistics, artificial pollination alone increased corn production by more than 100,000 jin. By the time of my visit, the income from the cooperative's dozen or so sideline occupations had reached more than 100,000 yuan. According to the plan, the total income could be increased by about 200,000 yuan by the end of the lunar year. This income was very important for supporting agricultural production and solving the cooperative members' pocket money problems.
    Cooperative director Wang Xingwu and his colleagues were talking about the mistakes in last year's production. He said: Our well-drilling work took too big a step, and it was messed up. We drilled wells in places where we shouldn't have drilled wells. We drilled 200 wells all at once, and they weren't used last year. Too many sweet potatoes were planted, and not enough small grains were planted, and the cooperative members had opinions. He said, "There are many mistakes, and from the root, it is because we didn't consult with the cooperative members enough. There were many good opinions that we didn't listen to."

    渤海社办高级社的第一年
    文英
    抚宁县渤海农业社，过去曾以收的粮食最多闻名河北。人们都想知道，他们自办高级社以后，收的粮食是不是比初级社的时候更多了。我也是怀着这个心情去的。我去的时候，正赶上社里闹起两大热潮：一个是秋耕、积肥，一个是向国家缴售粮食。在村外，遍地耕牛，应耕的地半数以上已经翻新。在社员们的猪圈里，近三天内就增加了三百多口猪，这是他们积肥的一项重要措施。每天很早，成队的送粮大车就出发了。1955年，这三千多户人家，曾缴售公粮、余粮四百八十多万斤；1956年增产了，卖的余粮达到了七百万斤。另外，还卖给国家花生、棉花共二十八万多斤。
    在四万多亩土地上，人们工作了约有八十万个劳动日，比1955年多工作了60％，每个劳动日的报酬达到一元三角。在初级社的时候，增加收入的不超过总户数的80％。1956年，92％的户都增加了收入。
    我访问了几个家庭，看到了这儿人们的生活在一年间发生的巨大变化。羊倌白荣的老伴，被过去的苦日子害得双眼失明了。我去看这位老太婆的时候，她笑着说：“我不缺别的，就缺个儿媳妇了。”如果说像这样的人家能够卖出一万多斤粮食，人们恐怕不会相信，但这是实实在在的事。这一家四口人里，有三个劳动力。白荣在社里专管放羊。他和一个儿子，一年中总有三个月的时间迎着海风暴雨，肩背食粮和锅碗，日夜和羊群一起生活在海滩草地上。他们的羊群由几十只变成几百只了。1956年，他和两个儿子共做了八百多个劳动日，各种收入折粮一万四千多斤。白荣总结他的生活变化的时候说：“我入社以后，第一年吃饱饭，第二年穿新衣，第三年是盖新被、住新房。”他家不久就要搬进三间新房去了。
    从社员曹殿喜身上，可以看到一个人在一年间的思想变化是多么大。曹殿喜在入社以前是个使着一辆新车和一头大骡子的中农。在初级社成立的时候，有人劝过他入社，他说：“你们的地是举拳头分来的，我的地是汗珠子挣来的，我不干。”1955年冬天高级合作化高潮来了，他咬着牙卖了自己价值五百多元的大骡子，换了一头老牛，“随风”入了社。因为他擅长饲养牲畜，被派作饲养员。开始，他光给自己的牛添草加料，不疼别的牲口。如果谁把他的牛使出点汗来，他就在背地里骂一顿。一个社干部说：“看当时的样子，他只要抓住社里一点差错，就会拉着他的老牛单干去。”虽然他的情绪不高，可是因为儿子、媳妇干的带劲，秋收分配后，他家的收入仍然比1955年单干的时候增加了五千多斤粮食。这是曹殿喜万万想不到的。现在，他整天满面春风。最近，队里添了一匹新马，他要把入社的时候留下来准备退社以后再用的牲口夹板拿出来，给新马使用。他说：“我这站在社外的一条腿进来了。”
    解放以前，在农村的街头上，常看到卖唱乞食的瞎子。这里也有这样的人，一个叫孙贵成，一个叫陈平。同样的遭遇，使这两个不同籍贯、不同姓氏的人结成了难友。他们曾沿街乞食，晚上在一起落泪。高级社改变了他们的生活。他们按照社章，每人领到了足够的粮、柴和衣被，还有零花钱，总计折款八十六元。他们自动到生产队帮助铡草，每人还挣二十来元的劳动报酬，他们再不感到孤单。晚上，常常给凑到他们跟前的人们唱唱自编的小调，倾诉他们愉快的心情。
    渤海社总结了一年的经验教训。社员们念念不忘的是他们在1956年生产上干了几手出色的活：施肥多，每亩施肥五车左右。挖了一条长达十八里的水渠，把渤海北岸的二千五百多亩旱地变成了稻田，每亩收稻谷五百多斤；把五百多亩草荒沙滩改造成了种花生的好地，收获了十万多斤花生。社员们开垦的八百多亩小片荒地，也不是小事，这些小片荒地也出产了三十多万斤稻谷和油料。全社四万一千多亩土地，有二万七千多亩种上了白马牙、金皇后。根据技术员们的统计，仅人工辅助授粉这项技术，就使玉米多产了十多万斤。到我访问的时候为止，全社十几种副业的收入已达到十万元以上。按照计划，到旧历年底共能增加收入二十万元左右。这些收入对于支持农业生产和解决社员零花钱问题顶了大事。
    社长王兴武跟他的同事们念叨的却是去年生产中的错误。他说：我们的打井工作步子迈大了，迈乱了，不该打井的地里，也打了井，一下子打了二百眼井，去年没用上。甘薯种多了，小杂粮没有种，社员有意见。他说：“错误很多，从根上说是因为我们和社员商量的少。有很多好的意见，我们没有听。”
