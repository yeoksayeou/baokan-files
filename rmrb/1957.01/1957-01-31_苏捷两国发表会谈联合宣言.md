Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 30th (TASS dispatch): A joint declaration of the talks between the Soviet and Czechoslovak delegations was signed on the evening of January 29th at the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow.  The joint declaration was signed by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, and on the Czechoslovak side, Prime Minister Široký.

In the joint declaration, the two delegations noted with satisfaction that during the talks held from January 25th to 29th, the two delegations held completely identical views on the tasks facing the current international situation.  Both sides believe that their primary obligation is to promote the unity of the socialist camp on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, and to promote the development and consolidation of friendship between socialist countries in the spirit of Lenin's principles of equality and fraternal cooperation among all peoples.  The two sides pointed out that although the relationship between socialist countries has encountered and inevitably will encounter difficulties, unresolved tasks, and individual shortcomings in its establishment and development, it has not been shaken as a result.

The declaration stated that the Marxist-Leninist principles on building socialism are universally applicable to all socialist countries, although in applying these principles, it should undoubtedly be adapted to the specific conditions of development of each country.  The fundamental interests of each socialist country and the interests of the entire world socialist system are completely consistent.  Strengthening and developing cooperation and mutual assistance among socialist countries will simultaneously strengthen the freedom, independence, sovereignty, and security of each of them, and promote their prosperity and improvement of people's living standards.

In assessing the achievements of Soviet-Czech cooperation, the two governments declared that the existence of the Soviet Union, its active socialist peaceful foreign policy, and its fraternal assistance to socialist countries are of utmost importance to the people's democracies and to the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism worldwide. The Soviet example and support helped the people's democracies firmly and confidently embark on the road to building socialism. The great struggle waged by the Soviet Union itself, together with the great People's Republic of China and the entire socialist camp, to uphold and strengthen the cause of peace, is the biggest and main obstacle that international aggressive forces will encounter when they try to realize their plans, and is the greatest hope of all peace-loving people.

The declaration continued, stating that the main objective of the foreign policies of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia is to maintain peace and ease international tensions.  In their relations with other countries, the two governments adhere to the principle of peaceful coexistence with all countries, regardless of differences in social and political systems.

The declaration stated that the development of the world situation fully confirms the vitality and correctness of the conclusion reached at the 20th Congress of the CPSU that war is not inevitable.  However, the people of the world are now facing the fact that international tensions have increased, a situation caused by the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt, the imperialist group's organization of a counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary, and the US ruling group's proposal of a new colonialist plan against the countries of the Middle East. The Czechoslovak government expressed its full support for the Soviet Union's timely assistance to the Hungarian people in crushing the armed counter-revolution at the request of the Hungarian government. The Soviet and Czech sides expressed their firm support for the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government and will help it consolidate the people's democratic system and continue to oppose all conspiracies by external aggressive forces to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs.

Speaking of the US's "Eisenhower Doctrine," the declaration pointed out that the Soviet and Czech governments support the desire of the Middle Eastern countries to smash all "old" and "new" plans of the colonialists, and support the desire of the people of these countries to develop a free and independent life and decide their own affairs. The two governments also believe that Egypt's just demands for the complete liberation of its territory from occupation by any foreign troops and for compensation from Britain, France, and Israel for the losses caused by the aggression should be met, and the culprits of the aggression and atrocities should be punished.

The two sides announced that they are willing to promote political, economic, and cultural ties with the countries of the Middle East on the basis of complete equality and mutual benefit, without attaching any conditions that would harm the sovereignty of other countries.

On the issue of disarmament, the Soviet and Czech sides believe that the proposals on disarmament and easing international tensions put forward by the Soviet government in its statement on November 17, 1956, create new possibilities for successfully reaching an agreement on the issue of disarmament. Both sides regretted that the Western countries have not yet supported the Soviet proposal.

In addressing the German question, the declaration exposed the West German militarist policies and the plans of the United States and other Western countries to revive West German militarism, equip the West German army with weapons of mass destruction, and force West European countries into tools for preparing new wars. The declaration stated that the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia cannot ignore this development of events in Europe. They will do everything possible to prevent the revival of German militarism. In order to oppose the revival of German militarism and strive for the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, the two sides also believe that it is necessary to make every effort to bring the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany closer to each other.

The two governments believe that the establishment of an effective European collective security system is the most reliable guarantee of peace in Europe and the world, and it also contributes to the solution of the German question. In view of the fact that the Western countries stubbornly refuse the Soviet proposal to abolish military blocs and are unwilling to abolish the aggressive North Atlantic bloc at present, the Soviet and Czech governments expressed their determination to consolidate the Warsaw Treaty Organization. The two sides believe that under the current situation in Europe, the Warsaw Treaty is a solid guarantee for the security of the peoples of Europe and world peace. The two sides are determined to make the Warsaw Treaty an effective tool for ensuring the security and defense of all countries, and for responding to any accidental and sudden events.

The last part of the joint declaration addressed the issue of developing relations between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. The declaration pointed out that the two governments will carefully maintain and consolidate the friendship between the people of the two countries, which is the foundation of the relations between the two countries, and will continue to fully develop close economic, cultural, scientific, and technological cooperation between the two countries.

In order to further cooperate in the implementation of broader collaboration between the industries of the two countries, the two governments instructed their economic institutions to sign corresponding agreements within this year. Trade ties between the two countries are developing and strengthening. Over eight years, the volume of trade has almost tripled. In order to meet the wishes of the Czechoslovak government, the Soviet government also agreed to additionally supply Czechoslovakia with 250,000 tons of grain, 9,500 tons of lead, and 1,300 tons of ferrochrome in 1957. The Soviet Union will increase the amount of iron ore supplied to Czechoslovakia in the coming years.

The two countries will further develop cultural, scientific, and technological cooperation. The two delegations reached an agreement on broad cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. Czechoslovakia will continue to supply the Soviet Union with uranium ore at fair and mutually beneficial prices, and the Soviet Union will also supply Czechoslovakia with the necessary equipment, provide technical assistance in the construction of atomic power plants and nuclear physics research institutes, and cooperate closely with Czechoslovakia in the study of the peaceful use of atomic energy. In addition, the two sides also exchanged views on some other important issues related to the relations between the two countries, and resolved these issues with the consent of both sides.

    苏捷两国发表会谈联合宣言
    双方对当前国际局势和任务的看法完全一致；首要义务是促使社会主义各国团结起来；坚决支持匈牙利工农革命政府；支持中近东各国人民粉碎殖民主义者“老”的和“新”的计划；尽一切努力使两个德国相互接近，阻止德国军国主义的复活；决心巩固华沙条约，保障欧洲安全和世界和平；进一步发展两国友好合作关系。
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联和捷克斯洛伐克两国代表团会谈的联合宣言在29日晚在莫斯科大克里姆林宫签字。在联合宣言上签字的，苏联方面是部长会议主席布尔加宁，捷克斯洛伐克方面是总理西罗基。
    两国代表团在联合宣言中满意地指出，在1月25日到29日举行的会谈中，两国代表团对当前国际局势向人们提出的任务的看法是完全一致的。双方认为，自己的首要义务是促使社会主义阵营的力量在马克思列宁主义的基础上团结起来，促使各社会主义国家本着各国人民平等和兄弟合作的列宁主义原则发展和巩固彼此间的友谊。双方指出，社会主义国家之间的关系在它的建立和发展过程中尽管也遇到过而且也不可能不遇到困难，遇到没有解决的任务和个别的缺点，但是它却并不因此而动摇。
    宣言说，马克思列宁主义关于建设社会主义的原则是一切社会主义国家共同适用的，尽管在运用这些原则的时候无疑应当适应各个国家的具体发展条件。各个社会主义国家的根本利益和整个世界社会主义体系的利益是完全一致的。加强和发展社会主义国家之间的合作和互助，也就同时加强了其中每一个国家的自由、独立、主权和安全，促进它们的繁荣和人民的生活水平的提高。
    在估计到捷苏两国的合作的成果的时候，两国政府声明，苏联的存在、它的积极的社会主义和平外交政策和对各社会主义国家的兄弟帮助，对人民民主国家和全世界的和平、民主、社会主义事业具有极其重要的意义。苏联的范例和支持帮助了人民民主国家坚决而有信心地走上了建设社会主义的大道。苏联本身以及它同伟大的中华人民共和国和整个社会主义阵营一起为维护和加强和平事业而进行的伟大斗争，是国际侵略势力要实现它的计划时所会碰到的最大的主要障碍，是一切爱好和平的人民最大的希望。
    宣言接着说，苏捷两国的外交政策的主要目的是维护和平、缓和国际紧张局势。在同其他国家的关系方面，两国政府遵循不问社会政治制度的差别同一切国家和平共处的原则。
    宣言说，世界局势的发展完全证实了苏共第二十次代表大会关于战争并非不可避免这一结论的生命力和正确性。但是，现在世界人民又面临着国际紧张局势加剧的事实，这种局面是英、法、以色列侵略埃及、帝国主义集团在匈牙利组织反革命叛乱，以及美国统治集团提出反对中近东各国的新殖民主义计划所造成的。捷克斯洛伐克政府表示完全支持苏联应匈牙利政府的请求及时地帮助匈牙利人民粉碎武装反革命的行动。苏捷双方表示坚决支持匈牙利工农革命政府，并且将帮助它巩固人民民主制度，继续反对外部侵略势力干涉匈牙利内政的一切阴谋。
    宣言在谈到美国的“艾森豪威尔主义”时指出，苏捷两国政府支持中近东国家粉碎殖民主义者一切“老”计划和“新”计划的愿望，支持这些国家的人民要求发展自由独立的生活、自己决定自己的事务的愿望。两国政府还认为，埃及关于要把它的领土从任何外国军队占领之下彻底解放出来，关于要英法以色列赔偿侵略所造成的损失的正义要求，应当得到满足，侵略和暴行的祸首应当受到惩罚。
    双方宣布，两国愿在完全平等和互利的基础上促进同中近东国家的政治、经济和文化联系，而不附带任何有损别国主权的条件。
    在谈到裁军问题的时候，苏捷双方认为，苏联政府在1956年11月17日的声明中提出的关于裁军和缓和国际紧张局势的建议，为就裁军问题顺利地取得协议创造了新的可能。双方对西方国家至今还没有支持苏联这一建议表示遗憾。
    宣言在谈到德国问题时，揭露了西德军国主义政策以及美国等西方国家复活西德军国主义、用大规模毁灭性武器装备西德军队和强使西欧国家变成准备新战争的工具的计划。宣言说，苏捷两国对欧洲事件的这种发展不能置之不理。它们将尽一切力量阻止德国军国主义的复活。为了反对德国军国主义复活和争取建立统一的民主的、爱好和平的德国，双方还认为必须尽一切努力使德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国相互接近。
    两国政府认为，建立有效的欧洲集体安全体系是欧洲和世界和平最可靠的保证，同时有助于德国问题的解决。鉴于西方国家顽强地拒绝苏联提出的关于取消军事集团的建议，不愿意在目前取消侵略性的北大西洋集团，苏捷两国政府表示决心巩固华沙条约组织。双方相信，在欧洲目前情势下，华沙条约是欧洲各国人民的安全和世界和平的牢固保障。双方决心使华沙条约成为保障各国安全和国防、应付任何偶然和突然事件的有效工具。
    联合宣言最后一部分谈到了发展捷苏两国的关系问题。宣言指出，两国政府将小心地维护和巩固作为两国关系的基础的两国人民的友谊，继续全力发展两国之间密切的经济和文化科学技术合作。
    为了在实行两国工业更广泛协作方面进一步合作，两国政府责成自己的经济机构在今年内签订相应的协定。两国之间的贸易联系正在发展和加强。八年以来，贸易额几乎增长了三倍。为满足捷克斯洛伐克政府的希望，苏联政府还同意在1957年额外供给捷克斯洛伐克二十五万吨谷物、九千五百吨铅、一千三百吨铬铁。在最近几年内苏联将增加供给捷克斯洛伐克的铁矿石的数量。
    两国将进一步发展文化科学技术合作。两国代表团就在和平利用原子能方面进行广泛合作的问题达成协议，捷克斯洛伐克今后仍将以公平和互利的价格供给苏联以铀矿石，苏联也将供给捷克斯洛伐克以必要的设备，在建筑原子能发电站和核子物理学研究所方面给予技术上的帮助，并且在研究和平利用原子能问题上同捷克斯洛伐克密切合作。此外，双方还就有关两国之间的关系中的一些其他重要问题交换了意见，并且在双方的同意下解决了这些问题。
