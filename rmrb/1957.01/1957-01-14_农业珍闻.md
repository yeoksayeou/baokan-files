It has many advantages: high egg production rate, with an average annual egg production of 190, and the highest reaching 323, which is nearly 100 more than ordinary local chickens; it is also tall and large, with roosters weighing up to six *jin* (approximately 3 kg) and hens weighing four *jin* (approximately 2 kg); it also matures quickly, requiring only 200 days; it has a strong foraging ability and is resistant to coarse feed.

　　Fresh Watermelons Can Be Eaten in the Twelfth Lunar Month

　　The agricultural cooperatives in Changgan County, Hainan Island, have harvested watermelons planted last winter, and they are being successively marketed in Haikou City.

　　In the past, farmers in Changgan County did not have the habit of planting watermelons in winter. However, last winter, the county's agricultural cooperatives broke with convention and tried planting 400 *mu* (approximately 26.7 hectares) of watermelons. As a result, they grew very well and are expected to yield about 110,000 *jin* (55,000 kg).
