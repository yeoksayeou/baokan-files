Yunnan Province's Trial Rearing of Eri Silkworms in Over Fifty Counties Shows Good Results

    (Our dispatch) In the motherland's frigid season, the winter silkworms in some areas of Yunnan Province are busily spinning cocoons. This type of silkworm is called the Eri silkworm because it likes to eat castor leaves. The Eri silkworm is originally a wild silkworm. It is physically strong and has great vitality. As long as the temperature is below 30 degrees Celsius and above 15 degrees Celsius, and there are castor leaves, it can grow and spin cocoons normally. The time for spinning silk and forming cocoons is generally between eighteen and twenty-five days. Therefore, in many places in Yunnan, it can be raised eight, nine, or even more than ten times a year.

    Last year, more than fifty counties in Yunnan Province trialled raising this Eri silkworm, and the results were very good. From May to October last year, 2,200 boxes of silkworm eggs were trialled, with an average yield of 2.5 jin of flat silk per box. Some state-owned farms and agricultural cooperatives raised silkworms with an average silk yield of more than five jin per box.

    This silkworm originated in India. It is not only a raw material for the silk industry but also a very good sideline production for farmers. Many agricultural cooperatives in Yunnan Province advocate planting castor and raising Eri silkworms as an important sideline production. For example, the Guanghua Agricultural Cooperative in Donggua Township, Chuxiong County, earned more than 13,000 yuan from raising Eri silkworms last year, accounting for more than 20% of the total agricultural income.

    云南省五十多个县试养蓖麻蚕效果很好
    本报讯　在祖国严寒的季节里，云南省有些地方的冬蚕正忙着结茧。这种蚕因为喜欢吃蓖麻叶，所以人们都叫它蓖麻蚕。蓖麻蚕，本是一种野生蚕，它体质强健，生活力强，只要在摄氏三十度以下、十五度以上的温度、并有着蓖麻叶的情况下，就能正常的生长、结茧。吐丝结茧的时间，一般在十八天到二十五天之间。所以，在云南很多地方，一年可以养八次、九次甚至十几次。
    去年一年，云南省有五十多个县试养了这种蓖麻蚕，效果很好。从去年5月到10月试养的蚕种有二千二百盒，平均每盒产平板丝二斤半。有些国营农场和农业社养的蚕，平均每盒产丝达五斤之多。
    这种蚕，原产印度。它不仅是一种丝绢工业原料，同时也是农民的一种很好的副业生产。云南省有很多农业社，把种蓖麻和养蓖麻蚕作为一项重要的副业生产来提倡。如楚雄县东瓜乡光华农业社去年养的蓖麻蚕，全年的收入就达到一万三千多元，占农业总收入的20％以上。　（秦军光）
