Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 15th -- According to the Vietnam News Agency on January 15th: The Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, recently said to Jean George, a reporter for Agence France-Presse in Hanoi: In order to maintain and develop the economic and cultural relations between Vietnam and France according to our wishes, it is necessary to properly resolve the issue of dispatching an official Vietnamese representative to France.

Pham Van Dong also said: "To promote commercial exchanges, agreements should be reached to prevent French exports to our country from being restricted by certain illegitimate prohibitions."

In answering questions, Pham Van Dong pointed out that the main factors in the normalization of relations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and France are, firstly, that the French government should fully assume its responsibilities as a signatory to the Geneva Accords and oppose acts that violate these accords; and secondly, that the issues currently under negotiation should be resolved quickly based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, especially the issue of the Vietnamese government sending an official representative to the French government.

    新华社河内15日电　据越南通讯社15日讯：越南民主共和国总理范文同最近接见法新社驻河内记者让·乔治的时候对他说：为了根据我们的愿望维持并且发展越法两国之间的经济和文化关系，必须适当地解决派遣越南驻法国正式代表的问题。
    范文同还说：“为了增进商业往来，应该取得协议，使法国向我国的出口不受某些不正当的禁令的限制。”
    范文同在答复问题时指出，越南民主共和国和法国之间的关系正常化的主要因素，首先是法国政府应该充分担负起日内瓦协定缔约国的责任来，反对违反这种协定的行为；其次，应该根据平等互惠的原则迅速地解决目前正在谈判中的问题，特别是越南政府向法国政府派遣正式代表的问题。
