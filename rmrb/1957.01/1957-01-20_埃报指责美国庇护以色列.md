Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 19th: “Al-Gomhouria”’s editor-in-chief, Sadat, wrote in the newspaper on the 18th that it is baffling that after the British and French withdrawal, Israel would adopt such a truculent attitude of refusing to completely withdraw from Egyptian territory. Because everyone knows that without the U.S.'s money and protection, Israel would not be able to exist as a country. Therefore, people have reason to ask the United States what the secret is behind Israel's farce.
　　
Sadat once again demanded that the United States stop Israel's adventurous behavior and warned the United States that its protection of Israel may cause it to suffer the same situation as its two allies, Britain and France.

    埃报指责美国庇护以色列
    新华社开罗19日电　“共和国报”主编萨达特18日在这家报纸上写道，使人感到莫名其妙的是，在英法撤退以后，以色列竟会采取拒绝完全撤出埃及领土这样蛮横的态度。因为大家都知道，如果没有美国的金元和庇护，以色列是不能够作为一个国家而存在下去的。因此人们有理由问问美国以色列的这种滑稽剧的秘密何在。
    萨达特再次要求美国制止以色列的冒险行为，并且警告美国说，美国对于以色列的保护可能使它遭到像美国的两个盟国英国和法国遭到的那种情况。
