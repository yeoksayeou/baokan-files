Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, January 25th: According to Sofia newspapers, Bulgaria decided to allocate 200 million leva (Bulgarian currency) in 1957 to encourage and help collectives and individuals build houses. This amount is double that of 1956.

The Bulgarian Council of Ministers passed a resolution specifically on this issue on the 21st. The resolution stated that the Bulgarian Party and government are very concerned about meeting the housing needs of the working people. Since liberation, many houses have been built throughout the country, and many new cities have emerged. The number of houses built for workers and staff in various places during the Second Five-Year Plan increased more than fourfold compared to the First Five-Year Plan. The number of houses built in 1956 alone exceeded the total number of houses built during the First Five-Year Plan.

However, due to the vigorous development of industry and the rapid increase in urban residents, the housing built in the past is far from meeting the needs of the working people. In order to further fully meet the need for housing, the Party and government believe that, in addition to state-built housing, it is also necessary to more broadly attract national funds to build collective and individual housing.

The resolution stipulates many new measures to encourage and help collectives and individuals build houses. At the same time, it also formulated methods to eliminate waste in construction. The resolution said that in Sofia alone, if waste can be eliminated, 300 more houses could be built above the plan in 1957.

### 保加利亚部长会议决定  大力帮助人民修建住宅

    保加利亚部长会议决定
    大力帮助人民修建住宅
    新华社索非亚25日电　据索非亚报纸报道，保加利亚1957年决定拨出两亿列弗（保币名）来鼓励和帮助集体和个人修建住宅，这个数目比1956年增加一倍。
    保加利亚部长会议21日专门为这个问题通过了一项决议。决议说，保加利亚党和政府非常关心满足劳动人民对于住宅的需要。自从解放以来，全国已经修建了很多住宅，出现了许多新的城市。在第二个五年计划期间为各地职工修建的住宅，与第一个五年计划期间相比，增加了四倍以上。仅在1956年一年所修建的住宅，就超过了第一个五年计划期间所修建的住宅的总和。
    但是，由于工业的蓬勃发展，城市居民的迅速增加，过去所修建的住房还远不能满足劳动人民的需要。为了进一步充分满足对于住房的需要，党和政府认为，除了国家修建住宅以外，还必须更广泛地吸引全国人民的资金，来修建集体和个人的住宅。
    决议规定了鼓励和帮助集体和个人修建住宅的许多新措施。同时，还拟定了消灭建设中浪费现象的办法。决议说，仅在索非亚，如果能消灭浪费现象，1957年就可以超计划修建三百所住宅。
