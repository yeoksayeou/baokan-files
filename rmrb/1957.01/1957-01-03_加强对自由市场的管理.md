    Strengthen the Management of Free Markets
    After the establishment of the Shanghai Dada Wharf Free Market Exchange, it strengthened the management of the market, and vendors and farmers from all over the country came to this wharf to trade. Before the establishment of the Market Exchange, farmers had to peddle along the streets, often running around for a long time without finding a buyer, and some who were unfamiliar with the Shanghai market situation were deceived by illegal merchants. The establishment of the Market Exchange is of great benefit to both buyers and sellers.

    加强对自由市场的管理
    上海大达码头自由市场交易所成立后，加强了对市场的管理，各地来到这个码头上的贩运商和农民都纷纷进入市场交易。在市场交易所成立以前，农民们只得沿街兜售，往往跑了半天还遇不到买主，有些不熟悉上海市场情况的还要受不法商贩的欺骗。有了市场交易所，对买卖双方都有很大好处。
    上　国营商业机构在市场以适当价格进行收购，避免市场到货过多的时候农民不得不把原货运回或低价卖出的现象。
