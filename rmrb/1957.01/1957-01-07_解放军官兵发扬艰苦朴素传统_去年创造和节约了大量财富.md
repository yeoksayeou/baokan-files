    The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, through diligence and thrift, practicing economy, created and saved a large amount of wealth for the country in 1956.
    The Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps, working diligently in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, produced a large amount of grain, cotton, and livestock for the country last year, and turned over more than 40 million yuan in profits to the state. Last year, the PLA units also saved a large amount of grain for the country. In the Nanjing area alone, incomplete statistics for the first half of last year show a surplus of 1.92 million catties of rice. The logistics department of the troops stationed in the Lanzhou area saved more than 296,000 catties of grain throughout the year. The Fujian front-line troops also saved more than 800,000 catties of rice last year, and have already taken out more than 126,100 catties to relieve disaster victims. The savings in grain by these troops are mainly due to the careful calculations of the supply personnel and the continuous improvement of cooking methods by the cooks. In addition, many troops have also reclaimed wasteland to grow grain and vegetables in their spare time, which has also saved a large amount of grain for the country.
    The PLA units have also made great achievements in tightening financial expenditures. Due to the strict regulations and implementation of various expenditure systems, the troops stationed in the Lanzhou area saved more than 88,600 yuan in telegram fees alone last year. The border defense officers and soldiers who are on duty all year round on the snow-capped mountains and grasslands of Xinjiang built their own barracks under difficult conditions, also saving the country more than 103,900 yuan in expenses last year.
    Many transportation units of the PLA have achieved remarkable results in cherishing and saving materials. The Ali Military Station transportation unit of the Xinjiang Military Region saved the country more than 2 million yuan last year by increasing the amount of camel transportation and organizing livestock grazing to save forage. The fuel management department and motor transport units of the Fujian front-line troops saved more than 192,000 kilograms of gasoline last year by strengthening fuel storage and constantly finding ways to save fuel.
    The "oil extraction team" established by the Communist Youth League group of a warehouse in the Lanzhou area, used their spare time to extract more than 4,000 kilograms of gasoline drop by drop from more than 10,000 empty oil drums in one year. Many motor vehicle units have also launched a "safe driving campaign," constantly creating new safe driving records, and generally reducing traffic accidents.
    In the past year, officers and soldiers of many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have also collected a large amount of scrap steel and iron to support the country's economic construction. Some units have also used waste products to renovate and save a lot of expenses. The Management Department of the Logistics Department of the Xinjiang Military Region recently used 23 tons of scrap iron to make stove covers and stove bars for the winter, saving the country more than 12,000 yuan.

    解放军官兵发扬艰苦朴素传统
    去年创造和节约了大量财富
    新华社6日讯　中国人民解放军官兵克勤克俭、厉行节约，在1956年中为国家创造和节约了大量财富。
    辛勤劳动在天山南北的新疆军区生产建设部队去年为国家生产了大批粮食、棉花和牲畜，上缴国家利润四千多万元。解放军各部队去年还为国家节省了大批粮食。驻南京地区部队仅去年上半年不完全统计，就节余大米一百九十二万斤。驻兰州地区部队的后勤部门全年节约粮食二十九万六千多斤。福建前线部队去年也节约大米八十多万斤，并且已经从中拿出十二万六千一百多斤救济了灾民。各部队这些粮食的节约，主要是靠供给人员的精打细算和炊事人员们不断地改进作饭方法等得来的。此外，许多部队还利用业余时间开荒种粮、种菜，也为国家节省了大批粮食。
    解放军各部队在紧缩经费开支方面，也做出很大成绩。驻兰州地区部队由于严格规定和执行了各种经费开支制度，去年仅电报费一项就节约八万八千六百多元。终年执勤在新疆雪岭和草原上的边防军官兵，他们在艰苦的条件下自己动手盖营房，去年也为国家节省经费十万三千九百多元。
    解放军许多运输部队在爱护和节约物资方面的成绩显著。新疆军区阿里兵站运输部队去年在提高骆驼运输量和组织牲畜放青以节省草料等方面，共为国家节约二百多万元。福建前线部队的油料管理部门和汽车运输部队，由于加强了油料保管和不断地寻找节省用油的窍门，在去年节约汽油十九万二千多公斤。
    驻兰州地区部队的某仓库青年团小组成立的“抽油小组”，一年中，利用业余时间从一万多个空油桶里，一点一滴地抽出了四千多公斤汽油。许多汽车部队还开展了“安全行车运动”，不断地创造安全行车新纪录，普遍减少了行车事故。
    中国人民解放军许多部队的官兵在过去一年中，还收集了大量的废钢废铁，支援国家经济建设。有些单位还利用废品翻新，节省下不少经费。新疆军区后勤部管理处最近利用二十三吨废铁，制作了过冬用的炉盖炉条，给国家节约一万二千多元。
