Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 24th -- Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Sichuan Province have prepared sufficient spring plowing production materials for farmers. Pesticides, agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers transported from Shanghai, Tianjin and other places, as well as phosphate rock powder, new-style farm tools produced in the province, are being transported by trains, ships, and automobiles to grassroots organizations in various counties.

This year, Sichuan Province has prepared a particularly large number of small farm tools for farmers, an increase of 19.7% over last year. The supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties began preparing these small farm tools last winter. The Santai County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has signed more than 400 farm tool purchase and sale contracts with handicraft cooperatives and agricultural cooperative sideline organizations, preparing more than 170,000 pieces of farm tools. Together with last year's inventory, there are a total of 350,000 pieces, equivalent to 50% of this year's total supply.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 23rd -- Shandong Province's agricultural and grain departments have prepared various grain crops, cotton, peanuts and other fine seeds for spring sowing for farmers, totaling approximately 90 million jin. Among them, more than one million jin of spring wheat seeds are being transported from the Tai'an area and will be supplied to farmers in the Jining and Heze areas who lack seeds in early February. Eight million jin of Dai Zi cotton seeds are also being expedited for transfer.

These high-quality seeds supplied and regulated by the state have undergone strict inspection and testing. The purity and soundness of various seeds generally reach over 90%, and the germination rate is also around 90%.

This year, the planting area of various improved crop varieties in Shandong Province is expected to expand compared to last year. The preliminary plan is to expand the area of improved corn varieties in the province from more than 15 million mu last year to more than 18 million mu this year, accounting for 74% of the total corn area. Among them, the area of hybrid corn was only more than 130,000 mu last year, and it will be expanded to more than 5 million mu this year. The new variety "Huabei 117" sweet potato, which was tested in Huangxian County, Licheng County, and other counties last year, has a slightly higher yield than the famous improved variety "Shengli 100" sweet potato. This year, it is planned to expand the demonstration area of "Huabei 117" sweet potato on the basis of continuing to promote "Shengli 100" sweet potato. The Fuhua peanuts in Fushan County mature early and have a high yield, and can be sown twice a year. This year, Tai'an, Jining, Linyi and other areas will select areas with the same conditions as Fushan County to focus on testing Fuhua peanuts.

    及早为农民准备春耕生产资料
    四川大批农药、农械、化学肥料下拨
    山东省准备好春播良种九千多万斤
    新华社成都24日电　四川省各级供销合作社为农民准备了充足的春耕生产资料。由上海、天津等地运来的农药、农械、化学肥料以及本省产的磷矿粉、新式农具等，正由火车、轮船、汽车运到各县基层组织。
    今年四川省为农民准备的小型农具特别多，比去年增加19.7％。这些小农具各县供销合作社在去冬就开始准备，三台县供销合作社已与手工业合作社、农业社副业组织签订四百多份农具购销合同，准备好十七万多件农具，加上去年的存货，共有三十五万件，等于今年供应总数的50％。
    新华社济南23日电　山东省农业、粮食部门已经为农民准备好春季播种的各种粮食作物和棉花、花生等优良种子，共约九千多万斤。其中春麦种一百多万斤正从泰安专区启运，2月上旬就可以供应给济宁、菏泽两个专区缺种的农民。数达八百万斤的岱字棉种，也正在加紧调运中。
    这些由国家供应和调剂的优良种子，都经过严格的检查和化验。各种种子的纯度和成实度一般都达到90％以上，发芽率也都在90％左右。
    今年山东省各种作物良种的种植面积，预计都将比去年扩大。初步计划全省玉米良种面积将由去年的一千五百多万亩扩大到今年的一千八百多万亩，占玉米总面积的74％。其中玉米杂交种去年只有十三万多亩，今年将扩大到五百多万亩。去年在黄县、历城等县试种的新品种“华北一一七”甘薯，产量比著名的良种“胜利百号”甘薯稍高。今年准备在继续推广“胜利百号”甘薯的基础上，扩大“华北一一七”甘薯的示范区。福山县的伏花生成熟早，产量高，一年可以播种两次。今年泰安，济宁、临沂等专区将选择和福山县条件相同的地区，重点试种伏花生。
