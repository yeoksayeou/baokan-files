Recently, in the past six months, all parts of our country have conducted a general review of the implementation of ethnic policies. Some provinces have completed the review, some are in the process of reviewing, and some are arranging for the review.

The existing materials show that the ethnic work in various parts of our country, under the joint efforts of people and cadres of all ethnic groups, has achieved great results in recent years. Among the more than 35 million minority ethnic population in the country, areas with more than 28 million people have basically completed socialist transformation, areas with 2.2 million people are undergoing socialist transformation, areas with nearly 2 million people are undergoing democratic reforms, and only areas with 3 million people have not yet undergone democratic reforms. The number of cadres from all minority ethnic groups has increased to more than 220,000. Autonomous organs have increased and been strengthened. The people of all ethnic groups have established the idea of being masters of their own affairs. The economic and cultural construction of various minority ethnic regions has also made significant progress. The lives of people of all ethnic groups have also improved significantly.

However, the review materials also show that there are still some problems that need to be resolved in the ethnic work of these years. The most important problem is that the growth of minority ethnic cadres is very slow, and both the quality and quantity cannot keep up with objective requirements; the nationalization of autonomous organs is also not done well enough. This makes it impossible for minority ethnic autonomous organs to effectively safeguard the special interests of minority ethnic groups and to fully act in accordance with the wishes of minority ethnic groups. Some agricultural and pastoral joint cooperatives in Zhuozi County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which were dominated by Han cadres, once affected the labor enthusiasm of Mongolian members and ethnic unity because the Han cadres despised animal husbandry labor. Some Han cadres working in the Miao areas of Guizhou, due to their lack of understanding of the customs and habits of the Miao people, allowed some Miao people to include "Flower Dance Slopes" and "Hemp Gardens" into agricultural cooperatives. They originally thought that this would increase the income of the Miao people, but it affected the opportunities and conditions for young Miao men and women to choose spouses, and the production enthusiasm of the Miao people declined as a result.

Why did these problems occur? According to materials from various regions, the first is that some Han cadres have ideological problems in their understanding of how to "help" the work in minority ethnic areas. Minority ethnic areas are relatively backward in economic and cultural development, and Han cadres should help minority ethnic people get rid of this backwardness. This is a noble responsibility. However, some Han cadres have not studied the local characteristics, mechanically transplanted the experiences of Han areas, and do not respect the wishes of minority ethnic people, nor do they pay attention to cultivating the independent working ability of local cadres, resulting in damage to the interests of minority ethnic groups and damage to ethnic unity. These comrades do not understand that the central purpose of Han cadres' assistance to minority ethnic groups can only be to make minority ethnic groups understand the principle of self-liberation and to make them rise up to change the original appearance of their own ethnic group. The main assistance of Han cadres to minority ethnic groups should be through various tasks, publicizing the policies of the Party and the state, cultivating the idea of "being masters of their own affairs" among minority ethnic people, making them understand their own goals of struggle, and learning various practical skills. Any specific work carried out by Han cadres in minority ethnic areas should be permeated with this spirit.

In areas where things are done in this spirit, the face of work will change. Suiding County in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is a county where Kazakhs, Uygurs, Uzbeks, Tatars, Hui, Han and other ethnic groups live together, and ethnic work is quite arduous and complex. Before 1954, some of the Party and government leaders in this county also had some wrong understandings and practices. In the whole year of 1954, only eighteen minority ethnic cadres above the district level were trained and promoted, and there were many problems in the work. In 1955, after they examined and corrected the past wrong understandings and practices, from January to September 1956, they trained and promoted fifty-eight cadres above the district and section levels. Now, among the fifteen county and district Party committee secretaries in the county, nine are minority ethnic cadres, and minority ethnic cadres also hold major leadership positions in the county people's committee and district offices. In this way, they not only met the needs of the county, but also sent twenty-eight minority ethnic cadres to higher-level organs. These minority ethnic cadres are familiar with the living habits of their own ethnic groups and can deeply understand the ideological feelings of their own ethnic people. Their handling of problems generally conforms to the wishes of their own ethnic people. In this way, the connection between the Party and the minority ethnic people is closer than before, and the Party's various policies are easier to implement downwards.

Some Han cadres in areas where many ethnic groups live together believe that minority ethnic groups have a small and dispersed population, and as long as the work of the majority is done well, the minority will naturally be led to progress. In fact, precisely because they are in the minority and have many special conditions and special requirements, it is even more necessary to use different methods to gradually make them progress. The work in areas where many ethnic groups live together obviously requires extra patience.

Some comrades also believe that after the socialist transformation is realized, the ownership system has changed, and the ethnic issue has become simpler. These comrades do not understand that the change of ownership only liberated the social productive forces in minority ethnic areas, making it possible for them to develop rapidly. However, their ethnic customs and ethnic characteristics still exist. Some new problems that have emerged with the socialist transformation also need to be patiently studied and resolved. If it is assumed that once the ownership system is changed, it is possible to disregard ethnic characteristics and not pay attention to cultivating the independent working ability of minority ethnic cadres, that is completely wrong.

In order to enable minority ethnic groups to develop into modern ethnic groups more quickly and to give fuller play to their active role in socialist construction, all Han cadres working in minority ethnic areas must first strive to cultivate minority ethnic cadres and improve their own working methods.

### 努力培养少数民族干部

    努力培养少数民族干部
    最近半年来，我国各地对于民族政策的执行情况，进行了一次普遍的检查。现在有的省份已经检查完毕，有的省份正在进行检查，有的正在布置检查。
    现有的材料表明，我国各地的民族工作，在各族人民和各族干部的共同努力之下，近几年来取得了很大的成绩。在全国三千五百多万少数民族人口中，已经有二千八百多万人口的地区基本上完成了社会主义改造，有二百二十万人口的地区正在进行社会主义改造，有近二百万人口的地区正在进行民主改革，只有三百万人口的地区还没有进行民主改革。各少数民族的干部，已经增加到二十二万多人。自治机关增多了，也加强了。各民族人民树立了当家作主的思想。各少数民族地区的经济和文化建设，也都有了显著的发展。各族人民的生活也有了显著的改善。
    但是，检查材料也说明，在这几年的民族工作中，还有一些需要解决的问题。其中最重要的问题是少数民族干部生长很慢，质量和数量都赶不上客观要求；自治机关的民族化也作得不够好。这就使得少数民族自治机关不能很好地维护少数民族的特殊利益，不能充分地按照少数民族的愿望办事。内蒙古自治区卓资县的一些汉族干部居多数的农牧业联合社，就曾经因为汉族干部轻视畜牧劳动，而影响了蒙古族社员的劳动情绪，也影响了民族团结。在贵州苗族地区工作的一些汉族干部，由于不懂得苗族人民的风俗习惯，而让一些苗族人民把“跳花坡”、“麻园”也入了农业社。他们本来以为这样可以使得苗族人民增加收入，但却影响了苗族青年男女选择配偶的机会和条件，苗族人民的生产情绪因此反而低落了。
    为什么发生这样的问题呢？根据各地材料，首先是某些汉族干部对于怎样“帮助”少数民族地区的工作，在思想认识上有毛病。少数民族地区经济文化比较落后，汉族干部应当帮助少数民族人民摆脱这种落后状态。这是一种崇高的责任。但是，有些汉族干部没有研究当地的特点，就把汉族地区的经验机械地搬运过去，并且很不尊重少数民族人民的意愿，也不注意培养当地干部的独立工作能力，结果就使少数民族的利益受到损害，使民族团结受到损害。这些同志不懂得，汉族干部对少数民族的帮助，中心目的只能是使少数民族懂得自我解放的道理，使他们自己起来改变自己民族的原来面貌。汉族干部对少数民族的帮助，主要应该是通过各种工作，宣传党和国家的政策，培养少数民族人民“当家作主”的思想，使他们了解自己的奋斗目标，并且学会各种实际的本领。汉族干部在少数民族地区进行的任何一件具体工作，都应该贯串着这种精神。
    凡是本着这种精神办事的地区，工作的面貌就会改观。新疆维吾尔自治区的绥定县，是哈萨克、维吾尔、乌孜别克、塔塔尔、回、汉等民族杂居的县份，民族工作相当艰巨和复杂。在1954年以前，这个县的一些党政领导人之中，也有一些错误的认识和作法。在1954年全年中，只培养和提拔了区级以上的少数民族干部十八人，工作中也有不少问题。1955年，他们检查纠正了过去的错误认识和作法以后，1956年1月至9月间，培养和提拔了区级和科级以上干部五十八人。现在，在全县十五个县委和区委书记中，有九个是少数民族干部，县人民委员会和区公所中也都有少数民族干部担任主要领导工作。这样，他们不但满足了本县的需要，还向上级机关输送了二十八名少数民族干部。这些少数民族干部熟悉本民族的生活习惯，能够深刻地体会本民族人民的思想感情。他们处理问题，一般都符合本民族人民的愿望。这样，党和少数民族人民的联系比从前更密切了，党的各种政策也更容易向下贯彻了。
    有些民族杂居地区的汉族干部，认为少数民族人口又少又分散，只要作好多数人的工作，少数人就会很自然地被带着进步。其实，正因为他们是少数，而且有许多特殊的条件和特殊的要求，才更需要用不同的方法，使他们逐渐进步。在民族杂居地区的工作显然必须加倍的耐心。
    还有一些同志认为，在实现了社会主义改造以后，所有制改变了，民族问题就简单了。这些同志不了解，所有制的改变，只是解放了少数民族地区的社会生产力，使它有可能迅速发展。但是他们本民族的风俗习惯和民族特点仍然存在。随着社会主义改造出现的一些新问题，也都需要耐心地去研究解决。如果以为所有制一改变，就可以不考虑民族的特点，不注意培养少数民族干部的独立工作能力，那是完全错误的。
    为了使少数民族能够更快地发展成为现代民族，使他们在社会主义事业中更充分地发挥积极作用，一切在少数民族地区工作的汉族干部，都必须首先努力培养少数民族干部，并且改进自己的工作方法。
