Xinhua News Agency, January 25th – The People's Liberation Army (PLA) units have decided to celebrate the Spring Festival thriftily and economically.

The PLA units stationed in the Shenyang area have decided not to buy meat or the scarce non-staple foods available on the market for ten days around the Spring Festival, and to buy as few other New Year goods as possible. The leading organs of the units stationed in Shenyang City also wrote a letter to the Shenyang Municipal People's Committee, requesting that the one jin of pork per officer that the Municipal People's Committee had decided to supply during the Spring Festival be transferred to the citizens. The organs, units, and schools of the PLA garrison in the Shenyang area have also decided that no banquets, no treating guests, and no gift-giving will be held by public organizations or individuals during the Spring Festival. Many officers and soldiers in various units have also cancelled their original plans to visit their families and friends during the Spring Festival, taking into account the difficulties in transportation. In addition to giving 6,980 jin of pork to the citizens, the organs, units, and hospitals of the PLA Navy stationed in Beijing have also reduced their purchase of flour by 30,000 jin, opting to eat coarse grains instead.

PLA units stationed in Nanjing, Hangzhou, and other areas are also adopting many concrete measures in the spirit of "celebrating the Spring Festival thriftily ourselves, so that the people can have a good Spring Festival." The leading organs of the PLA units stationed in the Nanjing area have cancelled their original contract to pre-purchase 3,000 jin of pork from the food company and have transferred tickets for a famous Yue opera performance of "The Lotus Lantern" to government cadres and citizens. The Air Force units stationed in Nanjing have also transferred three performances' worth of tickets and collectively ordered movie tickets to citizens for viewing. PLA units stationed in the Hangzhou area have decided to eat two-thirds less pork than originally planned during the Spring Festival, so that more pork can be given to the people. This unit has also requested that the relevant departments of the local government cancel the priority ticket purchase system for soldiers in theaters and cinemas during the Spring Festival, so that the people can have priority in purchasing tickets. In addition, officers and soldiers of the units stationed in Hangzhou will not take vehicles on short trips during the Spring Festival holidays, in order to facilitate the people's travel for visiting relatives and friends.

    让人民群众过一个好春节
    解放军各部队力求俭朴节约
    新华社25日讯　中国人民解放军各部队决定俭朴节约过春节。
    解放军驻沈阳地区部队决定在春节前后十天内不买肉类、不买市场上供应不多的副食品，并尽量少买其他年货。驻沈阳市的部队领导机关还给沈阳市人民委员会写了一封信，请求把市人民委员会决定在春节期间供应军官的每人一斤猪肉，全部转让给市民。沈阳地区驻军各机关、部队、学校并决定在春节期间，公家或个人一律不举行宴会、不请客、不送礼。各单位的许多官兵也已经取消了原来准备春节探家访友的计划，照顾交通运输上的困难。解放军海军驻北京的机关、部队和医院最近除了把六千九百八十斤猪肉让给市民以外，并且少购面粉三万斤，换吃粗粮。
    解放军驻南京、杭州等地区的部队也都本着“自己俭朴过春节，让人民过个好春节”的精神，采取许多具体措施。驻南京地区部队领导机关已经撤消了原来向食品公司预购的三千斤猪肉的合同，并且把一场著名的越剧“宝莲灯”的戏票，转让给政府干部和市民。空军驻南京部队也把三场戏票和集体订购的电影票，转让给市民观看。解放军驻杭州地区部队决定在春节期间比原供应计划少吃三分之二的猪肉，以便把更多的猪肉让给人民群众。这个部队还请求当地政府有关部门取消各剧院、电影院在春节期间对军人的优先购票制度，让人民群众优先购票。另外，驻杭州市部队官兵将在春节假日期间逢近路不搭乘车辆，以照顾人民群众省亲访友乘车方便。
