Winter Pest Control Must Not Be Abandoned Halfway
Commentator of this newspaper

Winter is the best season to eliminate agricultural pests. In winter, most pests hide in crop stalks, stubble, seeds, dead branches, fallen leaves, or weeds, and only come out to move and reproduce when the weather warms up. Therefore, eliminating one pest in winter is equivalent to eliminating hundreds or thousands of pests in spring and summer; moreover, while eliminating pests, many overwintering pathogens can also be eliminated at the same time.

Many areas have seized the opportunity to eliminate pests in winter and have achieved significant results. Jiangxi Province has continuously eliminated overwintering rice stem borers since 1950. The losses caused by stem borers in most parts of the province have been reduced from 10%-20% before liberation to 1%-2%. Some areas have basically eliminated stem borers. Luan County, Shanxi Province, has had forty agricultural production cooperatives comprehensively eliminate overwintering corn borers since 1954. In just two years, the infestation rate of corn borers has been reduced from 40% to 10%. From this, people can see the great significance of eliminating overwintering pests.

Some people think that eliminating overwintering pests is troublesome and labor-intensive, so they don't want to do it. However, many facts have proved that as long as measures are adapted to local conditions, arrangements are made separately, and various appropriate methods are adopted, it will not be very troublesome or labor-intensive. For example, to eliminate overwintering rice stem borers, according to research in recent years, it is not necessary to dig up rice roots. In paddy fields that are cultivated and planted in winter, as long as the residual rice roots on the field surface are collected, used for fertilizer accumulation, or used as fuel, the purpose of eliminating overwintering rice stem borers can be achieved. In paddy fields with sufficient water sources, irrigating and soaking the fields before the rice moths fly out in spring can also kill the borers. To eliminate overwintering pests such as corn borers and cotton red bollworms, a variety of methods can also be used.

Some people say: It doesn't matter if you eliminate overwintering pests. Why do we still have so many pests every year even though we eliminate them every year? In fact, this situation just shows that these places often do not thoroughly eliminate overwintering pests, doing the first half but forgetting the second half, so the effect is very poor. This is most clearly seen in rice-growing areas. Because some people think that removing or digging up the rice roots is enough to complete the task of eliminating overwintering rice stem borers, without properly treating the rice roots, the overwintering rice stem borers have not suffered a fatal blow, so the borers are still alive.

Some people also say: Our area did not have serious pest damage last year, so why should we eliminate overwintering pests? However, the reproductive capacity of pests and pathogens is very strong. The number of overwintering insects may not be large, but if they encounter suitable climate or other environments favorable to pests and diseases, the pest and disease damage will develop seriously. Therefore, except for some areas that do not need to eliminate overwintering pests because there is indeed no pest damage, general areas should carry out the work of eliminating overwintering pests.

Eliminating pests is an important part of agricultural production work in winter and spring. The leading organs in various regions can combine preparations for spring plowing with inspections to urge and promote this work. Agricultural technology extension stations and pest and disease forecasting stations in various regions should conduct detailed investigations of the overwintering situation of pests, and propose simple and effective prevention and control methods according to different situations, and provide technical support for this work. Agricultural production cooperatives should list the elimination of overwintering pests as an important item in their current production activities, properly arrange labor, and give work points for evaluation and recording, and reasonable remuneration, and take practical action.

    冬季灭虫工作不可半途而废
    本报评论员
    冬季是消灭农作物害虫最好的季节。在冬季，多数害虫都躲藏在农作物的秸秆、残茬、种籽、枯枝、落叶或是杂草中，一直要到天气转暖的时候才出来活动繁殖。因此，在冬季消灭一个害虫，就等于在春夏间消灭千百个害虫；而且，在消灭害虫的时候，还可以连带着把许多过冬的病菌消灭掉。
    有许多地区抓紧了在冬季消灭害虫的工作，已经有了显著的成效。江西省从1950年开始连续消灭过冬稻螟，全省大部地区因螟害造成的损失，已由解放前的10％—20％降低到1％—2％，有些地区已经基本上消灭了螟害。山西省潞安县有四十个农业生产合作社由1954年开始全面消灭过冬玉米螟虫，仅仅两年的时间，玉米螟的为害率已由40％压低到10％。从这里，人们可以看到消灭过冬害虫有多么重大的意义。
    有些人认为，消灭过冬害虫很麻烦，很费工，所以不想这样作。但是，许多事实证明，只要因地制宜，分别安排，采取各种适当的方法，是不会很麻烦、很费工的。例如消灭过冬稻螟，根据这几年的研究，并不一定要掘稻根，在冬耕冬种的稻田里，只要把田面残留的稻根收集起来，或积肥，或作燃料，就可以达到消灭过冬稻螟的目的。在水源充足的稻田里，只要在春季螟蛾没有飞出以前灌水沤田，也能杀死螟虫。消灭玉米螟虫、棉花红蛉虫等过冬害虫，同样可以采用多种多样的办法。
    有人说：消灭过冬害虫不管事，为什么我们这里年年消灭，年年还有很多害虫呢？其实，这种情况恰恰说明了这些地方消灭过冬害虫，常常是不彻底的，做了前半截，忘了后半截，所以效果很不好。这在稻区里看得最清楚。因为有些人认为把稻根锄掉或是掘掉就算完成了消灭过冬稻螟的任务，而没有把稻根加以处理，过冬稻螟并没有受到致命的打击，所以螟虫仍然活着。
    还有人说：我们这里去年虫害并不严重，为什么还要消灭过冬害虫呢？但是，害虫和病菌的繁殖力是很强的，过冬的虫数也许不多，可是遇上适宜的气候或其他对病虫有利的环境，病虫害就会严重地发展起来，因此，除了有些地区因为确实没有虫害而不需要消灭过冬害虫以外，一般地区都应当进行消灭过冬害虫的工作。
    消灭害虫是冬春两季农业生产工作的一项重要内容。各个地区的领导机关可以结合备耕检查，督促推动这项工作。各地的农业技术推广站、病虫害预测预报站要进行细致的害虫过冬情况的调查，根据不同情况，提出简便有效的防治办法，在技术上支援这一工作。农业生产合作社应当把消灭过冬害虫列为当前生产活动的一个重要项目，妥善地安排劳力，并予以评工记分，合理报酬，切实行动起来。
