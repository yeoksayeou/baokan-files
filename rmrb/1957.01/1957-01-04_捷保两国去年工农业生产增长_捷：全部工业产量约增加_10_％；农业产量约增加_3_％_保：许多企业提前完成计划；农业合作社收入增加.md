Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 3rd: Czechoslovakian newspapers published articles in the new year summarizing the achievements in industrial and agricultural production in 1956.

"Red Right Newspaper" wrote: In the first eleven months of 1956, brown coal production reached 40.5 million tons, 1.8 million tons more than the total production in 1955. During the same period, steel and iron production also exceeded the total production of 1955. Steel production increased by 9% compared to the same period of the previous year, and iron production reached 3 million tons in the first eleven months of 1956. In terms of machinery manufacturing, more than 22,500 various types of vehicles were produced in the first eleven months of 1956, more than 10,000 vehicles more than the total production in 1955. Total industrial output increased by approximately 10%. Agricultural output increased by approximately 3%.

An article published in the "Agricultural Newspaper" pointed out that although the climate was unfavorable in 1956, farmers still achieved a bumper harvest. The yield of rye per hectare increased by 10.3%, oats increased by 7.8%, and potatoes increased by 3.6%. Milk production increased by 5.7%. The sales of pork and beef increased by 14.5% and 8% respectively.

Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd: According to a report by the Bulgarian News Agency, the Bulgarian people made significant achievements in developing the socialist economy in 1956.

Many industrial departments completed or exceeded their production plans ahead of schedule. All canning industry enterprises completed their annual plans as early as November 25th, and chemical industry enterprises also completed their annual plans at the end of November, also over-producing tens of thousands of tons of fertilizer, soda, sulfuric acid, and other important products. Timber processing industry enterprises completed their annual production plans on December 4th. Miners supplied the state with more than 200,000 tons of coal above the plan, and oil workers also supplied the state with more than 15,000 tons of oil above the plan.

Compared with 1955, light industry produced an additional 14 million meters of cotton cloth, 970,000 pairs of leather shoes, and 52,225,000 cans of vegetables and fruits for the working people. Workers in the light industry department turned over more than 100 million leva (Bulgarian currency) in profits to the state.

Agriculture has also made great strides. In 1956, more than 300,000 additional working farmers joined agricultural production cooperatives. The land owned by state farms and agricultural production cooperatives now accounts for approximately 79% of the country's arable land. Milk production in the first ten months of 1956 increased by 40 million liters compared to the same period in 1955. The income of many cooperatives has increased.

In 1956, Bulgaria also did a lot of work to improve the living standards of the working people. Every employee benefited from the decision to reduce food prices in canteens and the decision to increase subsidies for families with many children. Preferential pension amounts have been increased. The prices of certain agricultural products purchased by the state have been increased. Many agricultural products are no longer purchased by the state. All these measures will enable the Bulgarian working people to receive an additional 2.8 billion leva in annual income.

    捷保两国去年工农业生产增长
    捷：全部工业产量约增加10％；农业产量约增加3％
    保：许多企业提前完成计划；农业合作社收入增加
    新华社布拉格3日电　捷克斯洛伐克的报纸在新年里登载了总结1956年工农业生产成就的一些文章。
    “红色权利报”写道：1956年头十一个月的褐煤产量达到了四千零五十万吨，比1955年全年产量多一百八十万吨。在同一时期，钢和铁的产量也都超过了1955年的全年产量，钢的产量比前一年同一时期增加了9％，铁的产量在1956年头十一个月达到了三百万吨。在机器制造业方面，1956年头十一个月共生产各种汽车二万二千五百多辆，比1955年全年产量多一万多辆。全部工业产量约增加了10％。农业产量约增加了3％。
    “农业报”发表的一篇文章中指出，在1956年，虽然气候不利，但是农民还是获得了丰收。每公顷黑麦的产量增加了10.3％，燕麦增加了7.8％，马铃薯增加了3.6％。牛奶产量增加了5.7％。猪肉和牛肉的缴售量分别增加了14.5％和8％。
    新华社3日讯　据保加利亚通讯社报道，1956年保加利亚人民在发展社会主义经济方面取得了显著的成就。
    许多工业部门提前或超额完成了生产计划。所有的罐头工业企业早在11月25日就完成了它们的年度计划，化学工业企业也在11月底完成了年度计划，还超计划生产了几万吨肥料、苏打、硫酸和其他重要产品。木材加工工业企业在12月4日完成了年度生产计划。矿工超计划供给国家二十万吨以上的煤，石油工人也超计划供给国家一万五千吨以上的石油。
    和1955年相比，轻工业为劳动人民多生产了一千四百万公尺的棉布、九十七万双皮鞋、五千二百二十二万五千听蔬菜和水果罐头。轻工业部门的工人向国家多上缴了一亿列弗（保币名）以上的利润。
    农业也有了大踏步进展。在1956年内，又有三十万以上的劳动农民加入了农业生产合作社。国营农场和农业生产合作社所拥有的土地现在约占全国耕地面积79％。在1956年头十个月所挤的牛奶比1955年同期增加了四千万公升。许多合作社的收入都增加了。
    1956年，保加利亚在提高劳动人民生活水平方面也做了许多工作。每个职工都从食堂食品减价的决议和增加多子女补助金的决议中得到好处。优抚金金额已经增加。某些由国家收购的农产品的价格提高了。有许多农产品不再由国家收购。这一切措施将使保加利亚劳动人民每年得到二十八亿列弗的额外收入。
