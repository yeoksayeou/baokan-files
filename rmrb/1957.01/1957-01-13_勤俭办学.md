Running Schools Diligently and Thriftily
    Checking for Inventory Backlog and Waste

    Recently, Beijing Normal University organized an inspection team to conduct a preliminary check on the university's inventory backlog and waste of materials, and found that the situation of inventory backlog and waste of materials in the school was relatively serious.

    The reasons for the backlog and waste of instruments are that they did not understand the actual situation when purchasing and did not cherish them when using them. For example, the Department of Physics ordered forty or fifty slide wire resistors from abroad for 290 yuan, but because they did not understand the specifications, they could not be used after the goods arrived. Some departments did not consider the school's lack of high-voltage equipment, but bought instruments that require high-voltage lines.

    There are many reasons for the backlog and waste of teaching materials. For example, the estimated number of copies of printed lecture notes was not accurate. When the teaching materials were sent to print, there was not enough internal communication within the school, resulting in overprinting, reprinting, or missed printing. The school leadership is now taking measures to overcome waste and achieve diligence and thrift in running the school.

    Formulating a Savings Plan

    Zhengzhou University is currently implementing the spirit of thrift and checking for wasteful phenomena.

    On December 10th last year, after Principal Ji Wenfu of the school made a mobilization report to all faculty and staff, each unit conducted a serious inspection. Some inventory backlogs and waste have now been identified. For example, in teaching equipment, the Departments of Physics and Chemistry alone had a backlog of more than 4,100 yuan. There were also backlogs of books and sports equipment, with a total loss of more than 600 yuan, of which more than 300 yuan was due to damage caused by students' lack of care for the instruments. In terms of food, there were monthly overruns. More than 400 pieces of broken glass since the beginning of this semester. Over the past three months, office supplies have exceeded the budget by more than 11,700 yuan. A general-purpose form printed by the school can be used for seventy-five semesters.

    Based on the preliminary inspection results, Gong Yiqun, Vice President of Zhengzhou University, made a report to all teachers, students, and staff on the afternoon of December 22nd last year entitled "Building a School Diligently and Thriftily, Running a School Diligently and Thriftily," emphasizing the significance of running a school diligently and thriftily, analyzing the causes of wasteful phenomena, and proposing ways to overcome wasteful phenomena, calling on everyone to work hard to implement the spirit of the Party Central Committee's instructions on building the country diligently and thriftily.

    Currently, all personnel in the school are continuing to conduct in-depth inspections, formulate savings plans and covenants, and further implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy.

    Cherishing Public Property and Saving Food

    Under the call for hard work and simplicity, and running schools diligently and thriftily, students of Chengdu Institute of Radio Engineering actively overcame the past erroneous behaviors of not cherishing public property and wasting food.

    In the past, the phenomenon of students in the school not cherishing public property and wasting food was quite common. Even public window glass and large light bulbs in offices were often taken by some students. Some students also arbitrarily installed lamps in their dormitories. Every morning, the discarded steamed bun crusts alone weighed six pounds. This situation aroused the attention of the school's administrative leaders, who immediately conducted universal education on hard work and simplicity among the students, and put forward the call to run the school diligently and thriftily. Now, many students have consciously examined their past mistakes and have returned the public property they had previously occupied. The phenomenon of wasting food has also been basically overcome, and some classes of students have even formulated covenants to save food and supervise each other. (Fang)

    Using Funds Carefully

    Recently, Zhang Ziying, Secretary of the Party Committee of Northeast Forestry Institute, made a mobilization report on increasing production and practicing economy to all faculty, staff, and students. Comrade Zhang Ziying pointed out that the institute is in the stage of school construction, and it should be more careful in using funds appropriately so that the existing equipment can give full play to its effective role.

    Northeast Forestry Institute has a tradition of hard work and simplicity. However, there are still some wasteful phenomena in all aspects. For example, waste in the use of water and electricity is still very serious, and some students have put forward excessively high demands in their lives. The phenomenon of not cherishing public property is still very common. In terms of personnel, some units are overstaffed.

    In terms of the use of school buildings, it is also necessary to study how to use the existing buildings more rationally and effectively. In terms of food, the cooks should further study how to make better use of food. The phenomenon of leftover food and wasting food often occurs in the cafeteria.

    Some comrades do not cherish teaching equipment and instruments enough. Brand-new planers and microscopes have been damaged. Many teaching and research groups did not carefully consider whether they were needed, and insisted on buying the best and most precise instruments.

    勤俭办学
    检查积压浪费情况
    最近，北京师范大学组织了检查组，对校内积压、浪费物资的情况进行了初步检查，发现全校积压、浪费物资的情况是比较严重的。
    仪器积压、浪费的原因是购买时不了解实际情况和使用时不加以爱惜。如物理系用二百九十元向国外订购滑线电阻四、五十个，但是因为不了解规格，货到后不能使用。有的系没有考虑到学校没有高压线设备的情况，却买了需要用高压线的仪器。
    造成教材积压、浪费的原因很多。如印刷讲义的份数估计不确实，在付印教材时，学校内部联系不够，结果就发生了多印、重印或漏印的情况。学校领导方面现在正采取措施，克服浪费现象，做到勤俭办学。
    制定节约计划
    郑州大学目前正在贯彻节约的精神，检查浪费现象。
    去年12月10日，该校嵇文甫校长向全校教职员工作了动员报告之后，各单位即进行认真检查。现在已经检查出了一些积压、浪费的情况。比如：在教学设备上，物理和化学两系就积压了四千一百余元，图书和体育器材也有积压，共损失达六百余元，其中因学生对仪器爱护不够而损坏的即达三百余元。在食粮方面，每月都有超支。这一学期开学以来，破损玻璃四百多块。三个月来超支办公用品一万一千七百余元，学校印的一种通用表格能用七十五个学期。
    根据初步检查的结果，郑州大学龚依群副校长于去年12月22日下午向全体师生员工作了题为“勤俭建校、勤俭办学”的报告，着重说明了勤俭办学的意义，分析了形成浪费现象的原因，并提出克服浪费现象的办法，号召大家努力贯彻党中央勤俭建国的指示精神。
    目前，全校人员正在继续深入地进行检查，制定节约计划和公约，进一步贯彻增产节约精神。

    爱惜公物节约粮食
    成都电讯工程学院学生在艰苦朴素、勤俭办校的号召下，积极克服以往不爱惜公物和浪费粮食的错误行为。
    过去，该校学生不爱护公物和浪费粮食的现象相当普遍，甚至公家的窗玻璃和办公室的大灯泡也经常被一些学生据为己有。有的学生并在自己的寝室里任意添装灯盏。每天早晨吃馒头光撕下的馒头皮就有六斤。这种情况引起了学校行政领导上的重视，立即在学生中普遍进行了艰苦朴素的教育，提出勤俭办校的号召。现在，很多学生都自觉检查了过去的错误，纷纷把以前占用的公物交还公家。浪费粮食的现象也已基本克服，有些班级的学生还订出了节约粮食的公约，彼此监督。　（房）
    精打细算使用资金
    最近，东北林学院党委张子英同志向全校教职员工学生做了增产节约动员报告。张子英同志指出，该院正处在建校阶段，更应当精打细算，恰当地使用资金，使现有的设备充分发挥有效的作用。
    东北林学院具有艰苦朴素的传统作风。但是，在各方面都还存在一些浪费的现象。例如水电使用方面浪费还很严重，有些同学在生活方面提出过高的要求。不爱护公物的现象仍然很多。人事方面有的单位人浮于事。
    在校舍使用方面，也还有必要研究如何更合理的更有效的利用现有房舍。在粮食方面，炊事员们应该进一步研究如何更好地利用粮食。在食堂里还常常出现剩饭和糟踏粮食的现象。
    有些同志不够爱护教学设备和仪器，崭新的刨床显微镜被损坏了，许多教研组没有周密考虑是否需要，一定要买最好的最精密的仪器。
