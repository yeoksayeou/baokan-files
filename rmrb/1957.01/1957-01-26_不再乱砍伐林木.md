Response to Criticism

    No More Indiscriminate Logging
    Letter from Xiaoguanhe Iron Factory: The criticism published in the People's Daily on December 12, 1956, regarding "Xiaoguanhe Iron Factory's indiscriminate logging" is completely correct. In addition to expressing our acceptance and gratitude, we also guarantee that we will no longer cut down construction timber from mature forests. At the same time, we will strengthen the inspection work of the coal mines and the education of workers. We have now sent people to fraternal factories that use coke instead of wood for iron smelting to learn, so that we can completely eliminate the use of wood for iron smelting in the future and save timber for the country.

    不再乱砍伐林木
    小关河铁厂来信：1956年12月12日人民日报登载了“小关河铁厂乱砍伐林木”的批评是完全正确的。我们除表示接受和感谢外，并保证今后不砍伐成林的建设木材，同时还要加强炭山的检查工作和对工人的教育。现在我们已派人到以焦炭代替木材炼铁的兄弟厂学习，以便在今后完全不用木材炼铁，为国家节约木材。
