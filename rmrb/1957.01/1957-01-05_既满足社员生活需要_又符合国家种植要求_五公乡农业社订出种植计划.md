Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 2nd. The Wu Gong Township Agricultural Cooperative in Raoyang County, Hebei Province, has formulated its planting plan for 1957. After repeated discussions and revisions by the members, the plan meets both the living needs of the members and the planting requirements of the state.

In the planting plan, the sown area and total output of cotton and peanuts are close to or exceed the reference targets allocated by the state. For example, the planned cotton planting area is 35 mu lower than the state's reference target, but the yield per unit area exceeds the reference target by 20 jin (seed cotton), and the total output can still meet the state's requirements. After the planned output of crops such as peanuts and soybeans meets the state's requirements by increasing the yield per unit area, it is also planned to squeeze out a part of the cultivated land to grow miscellaneous grains needed for the members' lives.

The planting plan also takes into account the living requirements of the members. The planned planting area of sorghum is 160 mu (none was planted last year), and the planned area of millet is also half more than the actual planting area last year. In addition, more than 60 mu of cultivated land are reserved for each production team to plant freely according to the requirements of the members. In this way, the eating habits of the members are taken care of, the daily needs of agricultural by-products such as sorghum stalks and chaff are met, and the difficulty of insufficient feed for draught animals in each production team is also solved.

After appropriately reducing the planting area of cash crops such as cotton and peanuts and high-yield crops such as sweet potatoes, the total agricultural income of the Wu Gong Township Agricultural Cooperative is 70,000 yuan lower than the planned target before the disaster last year. In order to ensure that the income of the members increases year by year, the cooperative plans to save 28,000 yuan in investment by using coarse fertilizer instead of fine fertilizer, exploiting the potential of existing water conservancy facilities, and reducing water conservancy construction expenditures. At the same time, it also plans to develop sideline production to increase income and make up for the reduced income in the agricultural planting plan.

Before formulating the planting plan, the Wu Gong Township Agricultural Cooperative held separate symposiums with members of various types, including production team leaders, veteran farmers, youths, women, and production experts, to solicit opinions from the members. Many members criticized the shortcomings of drastically reducing the planting area of millet and sorghum last year and ignoring the living needs of the members. However, some member cadres one-sidedly emphasized the needs of the members and ignored the needs of the state. They demanded to drastically reduce the planting area of cotton and peanuts and plant too much sorghum and millet. After discovering the above situation, the Wu Gong Village Branch of the Communist Party of China helped the agricultural cooperative summarize last year's agricultural production, so that the members correctly recognized the achievements and shortcomings in last year's planned planting. At the same time, in conjunction with the summary of production, it conducted a patriotic education for the members, corrected the members' ideological bias of ignoring the needs of the state, and led the members to formulate a planting plan that meets the needs of the members and the requirements of the state.

### 既满足社员生活需要　又符合国家种植要求  五公乡农业社订出种植计划

    既满足社员生活需要　又符合国家种植要求
    五公乡农业社订出种植计划
    新华社保定2日电　河北省饶阳县五公乡农业社制定了1957年的种植计划。这个计划经过社员的多次讨论修改后，既能满足社员的生活需要，又符合国家的种植要求。
    种植计划当中棉花、花生的播种面积和总产量，都接近或超过了国家分配的参考指标。例如棉花的计划种植面积，低于国家分配参考指标三十五亩，单位面积产量却超过参考指标二十斤（籽棉），总产量仍能达到国家的要求。花生、大豆等作物的计划产量，用提高单位面积产量的方法达到国家要求后，还计划挤出一部分耕地来种植社员生活需要的杂粮。
    种植计划也照顾了社员的生活要求。计划中的高粱播种面积有一百六十亩（去年一棵未种），谷子的计划面积，也比去年的实播面积增加了一半，此外还留出了六十多亩耕地，让各生产队根据社员要求自由种植。这样便照顾了社员的吃粮习惯，满足了社员对秫秸、秕糠等农业副产物的日用需要，同时也解决了各生产队耕畜饲草不足的困难。
    这个种植计划适当缩小了棉花、花生等经济作物和甘薯等高产作物的种植面积后，农业总收入比去年灾前的计划指标降低了七万元。为保证社员收入逐年增加，这个社计划用粗肥代细肥、发挥原有水利设备潜力、减少水利建设开支等办法，节约投资两万八千元。同时还计划开展副业生产，增加收入，弥补农业种植计划中收入减少的部分。
    五公乡农业社在制定种植计划前，曾分别召开了有生产队长、老农、青年、妇女和生产能手等各类社员参加的座谈会，征求社员意见。许多社员对去年大量缩减谷子、高粱种植面积，忽视社员生活需要的缺点，提出了批评，但也有一部分社员干部片面强调了社员需要、忽视了国家需要，他们要求大量缩减棉花、花生的种植面积，过多的种植高粱、谷子。中共五公村支部发现上述情况后，帮助农业社总结了去年的农业生产，使社员正确地认识去年计划种植当中的成绩和缺点，同时并结合总结生产，向社员进行了一次爱国主义教育，纠正社员忽视国家需要的思想偏向，领导社员订出了符合社员需要和国家要求的种植计划。
