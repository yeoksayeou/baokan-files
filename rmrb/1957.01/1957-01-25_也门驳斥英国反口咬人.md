Xinhua News Agency, January 24th, London Dispatch: The Yemeni Embassy in London issued a statement on the 23rd, refuting the British government's accusations that Yemen attacked the so-called "Aden Protectorate."

The statement said: "On the contrary, it is British troops and aircraft that are attacking Yemeni cities and villages, using bombs and rockets."

The Yemeni Embassy's statement was issued in response to remarks made by the new British Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr. Maclay. Maclay was originally Minister of State for Colonial Affairs. On the 22nd, in a written response to questions raised by members of the House of Commons, he said that Yemeni tribal people had launched attacks and offensives, and in some incidents, they were supported by the Yemeni army.

The Yemeni Embassy statement said: "The fact is that uprisings have occurred in the areas under British occupation." The statement said: "The claim that the so-called insurgents are incited and armed by the Yemeni authorities is merely to justify Britain's continued military action against Yemen and against those insurgents who are fighting for freedom."

    也门驳斥英国反口咬人
    新华社24日讯　伦敦消息：也门驻伦敦公使馆在23日发表声明，驳斥英国政府指责也门袭击所谓“亚丁保护地”。
    声明说：“相反，是英国的军队和飞机进攻也门的城市和乡村，并且使用了炸弹和火箭炮”。
    也门公使馆的声明是针对英国新任苏格兰事务大臣麦克莱的谈话发表的。麦克莱原来是协办殖民地事务国务大臣。22日，他在下院对议员提出的问题作书面答复说，也门部落人民发动了袭击和进攻，在有些事件中，他们得到也门军队的支持。
    也门公使馆声明说：“事实是，在英国占领下的地区发生了起义。”声明说：“所谓起义者是由也门当局煽动起来并且加以武装的这种说法，只是为了替英国继续对也门和对那些争取自由的起义者采取军事行动的行为进行辩解”。
