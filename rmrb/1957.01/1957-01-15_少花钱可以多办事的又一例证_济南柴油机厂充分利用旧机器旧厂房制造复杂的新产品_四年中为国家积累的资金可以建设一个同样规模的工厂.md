Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, January 14th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Ying reports: In the first four years of the Five-Year Plan, the state-owned Jinan Diesel Engine Factory, due to its attention to implementing the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, has accumulated funds for the state that could build a diesel engine factory of the same scale. By August of last year, the factory's various indicators had reached the 1957 levels ahead of schedule.

The factory's original foundation was very poor. The machines were old and worn-out belt-driven lathes from twenty years ago. The factory buildings were crowded, and there were no lifting facilities. Before 1953, it could only produce simple and crude products such as waterwheels, cement mixers, and diesel pile drivers. When the relevant departments at a higher level decided in 1952 that the factory should specialize in the production of diesel engines, the factory's leaders once believed that it would require the state to invest 3.5 million yuan to rebuild the factory before they could produce such precision machinery as diesel engines. Later, they saw that the state could not provide so much money at that time, and the production of diesel engines was in great need. They began to pay attention to relying on engineering technicians and workers to exploit the potential of the original equipment to complete the production tasks. When they started producing diesel engines, they did not have precision boring machines to process the main parts of the diesel engine – the cylinders. They modified an old lathe into a horizontal cylinder boring machine to replace it. They didn't have a cylinder grinder, so they studied how to stand an old lathe upright, add a boring bar, and replace the work of the grinder. Last year, when they trial-produced a 180-horsepower diesel engine, the equipment for processing the crankshaft could not guarantee the precision of the processed products. Based on the principle of the crankshaft lathe, they used an ordinary old 12-foot belt-driven lathe to design a two-end drive structure and asked a fraternal factory to help extend the bed surface to 16 feet, overcoming this difficulty at a cost of just over 10,000 yuan. In the past four years, the factory has launched eight major equipment improvements through mobilizing its employees, saving a large amount of investment for the state.

By the end of last year, the factory's total floor area had only increased by 11.55% compared to 1953, and the machinery and equipment had increased by 29%. Belt-driven lathes still accounted for 30% of the factory's equipment. However, the total output value (calculated at constant prices) increased by 1.2 times compared to 1953, and the output increased by 39.45% compared to the targets set for the first four years of the first Five-Year Plan. In the past four years, the factory has produced a large number of diesel engines, supporting the economic construction of various regions.

The factory attaches great importance to the work of planning management, which has continuously improved labor productivity and product quality. By December of last year, the single-unit working hours for manufacturing a 90-horsepower diesel engine had been reduced by more than 2,000 working hours compared to 1954. The wealth created by each production worker in the factory for the state each year increased from 10,750 yuan to 27,422 yuan. Last year, the average scrap rate of castings in the factory decreased from 8.3% in 1955 to 2.218%.

The factory has also taken many measures to accelerate capital turnover, greatly reducing management expenses. Last year, the enterprise management fees and workshop expenses borne by each thousand yuan of value decreased from more than 182 yuan in 1953 to more than 96 yuan. Last year, the turnover days of working capital did not exceed 120 days, shortening the time by 72 days compared to 1955. This indicator reached the planned level for 1957 in July last year. In the past four years, the factory has over-fulfilled the cost reduction target by more than 580,000 yuan, and the profits over-submitted to the state reached more than 770,000 yuan.

    少花钱可以多办事的又一例证
    济南柴油机厂充分利用旧机器旧厂房制造复杂的新产品
    四年中为国家积累的资金可以建设一个同样规模的工厂
    新华社济南14日电　新华社记者王影报道：国营济南柴油机厂在五年计划前四年中，由于注意贯彻勤俭办企业的方针，已经为国家积累了可以建设一个同样规模的柴油机厂的资金。到去年8月，这个厂的各项指标就先后提前达到了1957年的水平。
    这个工厂原来的基础很差，机器是二十年前的破旧皮带车床，厂房内拥挤不堪，而且没有起重设备，在1953年以前只能生产水车、水泥搅拌机、柴油打桩机等简单粗糙的产品。当1952年上级有关部门确定这个厂专门生产柴油机的时候，厂的领导人员曾经认为需要由国家投资三百五十万元重新改建，才能生产像柴油机那样精密的机器。后来，他们看到当时国家不可能拿出这么多的钱来，柴油机的生产又很需要，他们才开始注意认真地依靠工程技术人员和工人，发挥原有设备潜力，来完成生产任务。开始生产柴油机的时候，没有精密的搪床加工柴油机上的主要部件——汽缸，他们就用一台破旧的车床改装成卧式搪缸机来代替它；没有磨缸机，他们就研究用一台旧车床竖起来，加上个搪杆，代替了磨缸机的工作。去年试制一百八十马力柴油机的时候，加工曲轴的设备不能保证加工品的精密度。他们也根据曲轴车床的原理，利用一台十二尺的普通的旧皮带车床，设计了两头传动的结构，并且请兄弟厂帮助把床面加长到十六尺，只花了一万多元就克服了这一困难。四年来，这个厂经过发动职工改进的重大设备就有八件，为国家节省了大量投资。
    到去年年底，全厂的厂房面积只比1953年增加11.55％，机器设备增加29％，厂内的皮带车床还占到30％，而生产总值（按不变价格计算）却比1953年增加了一点二倍，产量比第一个五年计划前四年规定的指标提高了39.45％。四年中，这个厂生产出大批柴油机，支援了各地的经济建设。
    这个厂十分重视计划管理的工作，使劳动生产率和产品质量得到不断提高。到去年12月份，制造九十马力柴油机的单台工时，已经比1954年降低了两千多个工时；全厂每个生产工人每年为国家创造的财富，由一万零七百五十多元增加到两万七千四百二十二元。这个厂去年铸件的废品率，平均由1955年的8.3％降低到2.218％。
    这个厂还采取很多措施，加速资金周转，使管理费用大大减少。去年每千元价值所负担的企业管理费和车间经费，已经由1953年的一百八十二元多降低到九十六元多。去年流动资金的周转天数不超过一百二十天，比1955年缩短了七十二天，这项指标到去年7月就达到了1957年的计划水平。四年中，这个厂超额降低成本五十八万多元，超额上缴给国家的利润达七十七万多元。
