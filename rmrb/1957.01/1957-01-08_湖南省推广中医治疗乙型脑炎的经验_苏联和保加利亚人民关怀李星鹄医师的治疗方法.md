    Hunan Province Promotes the Experience of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Treating Japanese Encephalitis
    Soviet and Bulgarian People Care About Dr. Li Xinghu's Treatment Methods
    This Newspaper reports: Yiyang City, Hunan Province's famous traditional Chinese medicine doctor, Li Xinghu, has achieved significant success in treating Japanese encephalitis. Recently, the Hunan Provincial Health Department helped him summarize this experience and promoted it as an effective measure for preventing and controlling Japanese encephalitis throughout the province in the future.
    When Japanese encephalitis was prevalent in some areas of Hunan last August, the Hunan Provincial Health Department invited traditional Chinese medicine doctor Li Xinghu to Changsha. At the Hunan Provincial Infectious Disease Hospital, fifteen patients deemed untreatable recovered under his care. Prior to this, he had cured more than forty Japanese encephalitis patients.
    Li Xinghu's achievements in treating Japanese encephalitis have aroused widespread interest and attention from both traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners in Hunan Province. Western medicine doctors Xu Keqin and Fan Mengrong of Yiyang People's Hospital, among others, used Li Xinghu's treatment experience to cure three Japanese encephalitis patients last August. Traditional Chinese medicine doctors in thirteen counties and cities, including Changde, Zhuzhou, and Zhijiang, as well as traditional Chinese medicine doctors at the Hunan Provincial Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, also learned from Li Xinghu's experience in treating Japanese encephalitis.
    Li Xinghu's remarkable achievements in treating Japanese encephalitis, after being reported by TASS, attracted the attention of Soviet readers. From last September to the present, Li Xinghu has received a total of twenty letters from Soviet citizens. The Deputy Minister of the Soviet Ministry of Health also sent a telegram inquiring about the effectiveness of Li Xinghu's treatment for Japanese encephalitis, requesting him to share the medications and treatment methods. The Bulgarian newspaper "Black Sea Outpost" also recently published news of Li Xinghu's significant achievements in treating Japanese encephalitis.
    Inviting traditional Chinese medicine doctor Li Xinghu to treat Japanese encephalitis and achieving very good results is one of the remarkable achievements of Hunan Province in utilizing and giving play to the strength of traditional Chinese medicine. Li Xinghu is sixty-eight years old this year and has been practicing medicine for more than forty years. (Liang Yi)

    湖南省推广中医治疗乙型脑炎的经验
    苏联和保加利亚人民关怀李星鹄医师的治疗方法
    本报讯　湖南省益阳市著名中医李星鹄治疗乙型脑炎获得显著成就。最近湖南省卫生厅帮助他总结了这个经验，并将这个经验加以推广，作为今后在全省范围内防治乙型脑炎的有效措施。
    当去年8月湖南部分地区有乙型脑炎流行的时候，中医李星鹄应湖南省卫生厅邀请前往长沙。在湖南省传染病院，有十五个被认为无法治疗的患者在他的医治下恢复了健康。在这以前，共有四十多个乙型脑炎患者都曾被他治好。
    李星鹄治疗乙型脑炎的成就，引起了湖南省中西医的广泛兴趣和重视。益阳人民医院西医徐克钦和樊梦融等曾利用李星鹄的治疗经验，在去年8月间治好了三个乙型脑炎患者。常德、株州和芷江等十三个县、市的中医师和湖南省立中医院的中医师，也向李星鹄学习了治疗乙型脑炎的经验。
    李星鹄治疗乙型脑炎的显著成绩，经塔斯社报道后，引起了苏联读者的注意。从去年9月到目前为止，李星鹄共收到二十封苏联公民的来信。苏联保健部副部长还曾拍来电报，向李星鹄询问治疗乙型脑炎的疗效，要求他将用药和治疗方法告诉他们。保加利亚的“黑海前哨”报，也在不久以前登载了李星鹄治疗乙型脑炎获得显著成就的消息。
    邀请中医李星鹄治疗乙型脑炎获得了很好的效果，是湖南省运用和发挥中医力量的显著成就之一。李星鹄今年六十八岁，行医已达四十多年。　（梁一）
