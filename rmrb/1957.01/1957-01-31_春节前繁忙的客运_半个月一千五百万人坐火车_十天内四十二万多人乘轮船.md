Xinhua News Agency, January 30th: The heavy passenger transport work before the Spring Festival has basically ended. In the half month from the 16th to today, the national railways have transported a total of about 15 million passengers. In terms of shipping, ships on the Yangtze River and along the coast (north of Ningbo) transported more than 420,000 passengers in the past ten days.

The highest railway passenger volume was on January 27th. On this day, more than 1.1 million passengers were transported, which was more than 310,000 more than the highest daily passenger volume before the Spring Festival last year. In terms of shipping, the Shanghai-to-Northern Jiangsu route transported as many as 26,000 passengers in the past two days, five times more than usual. From today, the number of passengers on national railways and sea and river transport will begin to decline.

In order to meet the needs of Spring Festival passenger transport as much as possible, the transportation department, under the instructions of the State Council, has taken many effective measures. In addition to using all available passenger cars, the Ministry of Railways also selected more than 2,800 freight cars to be used as short-distance passenger cars. In order to allow the railway to accommodate more passenger trains, some lines have also suspended medium repairs or double-track construction. In the past half month, the national railways have added more than 1,600 temporary trains. In terms of shipping, the Yangtze River alone added fifteen ships to participate in passenger transport. Among them, the Shanghai-to-Northern Jiangsu route, which has a relatively large number of passengers, added eight ships.

Although the transportation department took measures in advance to increase transportation capacity, and various places have done a lot of organizational work for Spring Festival passenger transportation, the phenomenon of crowding on cars and ships is still unavoidable due to the large number of passengers.

The passenger transport task after the Spring Festival is still arduous. Relevant departments are paying attention to strengthening this work.

    春节前繁忙的客运
    半个月一千五百万人坐火车
    十天内四十二万多人乘轮船
    新华社30日讯　春节前繁重的旅客运输工作已经基本结束。全国铁路从16日起到今天为止的半个月中，总共运输旅客一千五百万人左右。航运方面，长江和沿海（宁波以北）的轮船在过去十天中共运输了旅客四十二万多人。
    铁路旅客运量最高是1月27日。这一天运输的旅客达一百一十多万人，比去年春节前最高一天的客运量还多三十一万多人。航运方面，从上海到苏北的航线前两天运输的旅客都多达两万六千人，比平时增加五倍。从今天起，全国铁路和海、河运输的旅客数量都开始下降了。
    为了尽量满足春节客运的需要，交通运输部门在国务院的指示下，采取了许多有效的措施。铁道部除了动用所有可以利用的客车以外，还挑选出两千八百多辆棚车代替短途客车使用。为了使铁路能够通过更多的旅客列车，有些线路并且停止中修或复线施工。在过去半个月中，全国铁路总共多开了一千六百多列临时列车。航运方面，仅长江就增加了十五条船参加客运。其中旅客比较多的上海到苏北的航线就增加了八条船。
    虽然交通运输部门事前采取措施增加运输力量，各地对春节旅客运输又做了许多组织工作，但是，因为旅客数量很大，车、船上还是避免不了拥挤的现象。
    春节以后的旅客运输任务仍然是繁重的。有关部门正在注意加强这一方面的工作。
