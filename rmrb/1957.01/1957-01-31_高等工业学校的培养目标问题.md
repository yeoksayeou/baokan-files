The issue of training objectives for higher industrial schools is the central issue of teaching. Before the teaching reforms, higher industrial schools engaged in aimless generalist education. After learning from the Soviet experience and carrying out teaching reforms, we learned a whole set of systems and methods for conducting planned teaching work around a clear goal. This was a great step forward. Our training objective was to translate the Soviet teaching plan's designation of "so-and-so engineer." Our teaching requirements were then largely determined by each teacher's individual understanding of the word "engineer." The quality of teaching improved in some respects, but students' learning burden was too heavy, their independent working ability was poor, and their specialties were divided too finely and specialized, which caused difficulties in job placement. These do not meet our national requirements and are worthy of our research and improvement. Lei Tianjue, an experienced engineer and vice president of the university, made the following assessment of current college graduates: "When they first arrive at the factory, they can immediately take on some work because they have learned some professional knowledge. This is their advantage. However, their shortcomings are quickly exposed in their work because their basic theories are not deep and broad enough. Whether in solving technical problems or improving scientific and technological levels, they have difficulties that are difficult to overcome." It is good to have a clear goal in today's teaching work, but setting the goal too high and too rigidly is one of the main reasons for the excessive learning burden on students. Because of the excessive emphasis on the requirement that students be able to work as a "so-and-so engineer" as soon as they leave school, professional courses appear large and complex, and all purely empirical professional production knowledge is brought into the classroom indiscriminately. On the other hand, the principle that basic theoretical courses and basic technical courses must have sufficient extracurricular time for students to conduct independent self-study is ignored, and these courses are squeezed into the lower grades, with up to thirty-five or six hours of classes per week. Then, with a learning time limit of fifty-four hours per week, how much time is left for students to work independently? The problem today is not that we do not cultivate students' ability to work independently, but that students simply lack the opportunity and time to work independently in school. At the same time, due to the excessive emphasis on professional courses, important links such as basic technical courses have been excessively weakened, both in terms of teachers and teaching work. Even in professional courses, many experienced professors spend more effort on opening minor specialized courses, and often leave the main professional courses to young teachers with less experience.

Does the state require graduates of higher industrial schools to become engineers as soon as they leave school? Obviously not. Although higher industrial schools have repeatedly emphasized the need to train engineers in the past, graduates are actually given the title of probationary technician when they enter production posts. That is to say, graduates of higher industrial schools still need a certain amount of practical work experience to perform the duties of an engineer and be given the title of a certain grade engineer. Requiring graduates of higher industrial schools to become engineers as soon as they leave school is as unrealistic and excessive as requiring graduates of comprehensive universities to become researchers at the Academy of Sciences or lecturers at universities. Of course, in the context of the rapid development of the country's construction, it is also possible for individual teaching assistants who have just graduated from university to lecture in the classroom, and for individual technicians who have just graduated to do the work of engineers.

Although graduates of higher industrial schools have the basic knowledge of engineers and have received basic training in engineering during their time at school, they still need to undergo a period of production training after graduation to be competent for the work of an engineer. This is obvious. However, some people still feel that since graduates of higher industrial schools have the basic knowledge of engineers, what harm is there in giving them the title of engineer? Some people also assert that there is nothing wrong with calling such people engineers. Of course, if you must call them that, it is not impossible, but it is always at a distance from our social habits and common sense understanding.

Then, why is the training objective of Soviet higher industrial schools "engineer"? This is a habit left over from the Tsarist era, which is also consistent with German habits. Japan imitated the German teaching system and translated the title of higher industrial school graduate into "Bachelor of Engineering," but it only represents "engineering personnel" who have received a certain amount of basic engineering training, and it only represents the meaning of "higher industrial school graduate." This title of "engineer" is at a certain distance from the requirements of the "engineer rank" that is habitually used in our country. If we confuse the requirements of the "engineer" training objective of Soviet higher industrial schools with the requirements of the "engineer rank" commonly used in our country, it will inevitably lead to excessive demands on the teaching work of higher industrial schools.

Another consequence of specifically defining the training objective of higher industrial schools as "so-and-so engineer" is inevitably the excessively detailed and specialized professional settings. Because the specific work of engineers always becomes more and more detailed with the continuous development of technology. If we pursue the goal of becoming an engineer as soon as we leave school, we will inevitably require the establishment of very detailed and specialized majors within the school. We will not talk about the adverse consequences of neglecting the necessary basic training in order to pursue excessively detailed and specialized training, but even if the minimum basic training is barely guaranteed, can the excessively detailed and specialized training meet the needs of the country? Judging from the experience of job placement in recent years, it is obviously difficult to meet the needs. The narrower the scope, the more difficult it is to match, and the easier it is for graduates to feel that they are "changing careers." On the surface, it seems that the training objective is "clear" because of the excessively detailed majors, and it seems to guarantee that graduates can become such and such engineers as soon as they leave school. In reality, graduates have to "change careers" in large numbers because the majors are divided too finely and do not match, and they have to start from scratch. In addition, the foundation is not solid, so they achieve half the result with twice the effort. We are not saying that it is not possible to divide into finer details and set goals for planned training under any circumstances. However, this is only possible when the industrial development is relatively stable and develops at a constant rate, and there are no revolutionary changes in technology. Some more mature majors had such a stable situation in the 1930s. However, the specific situation in our country is not like this. The proportion of national industrial development is changing rapidly. We are in an era of rapid technological development and change. Not only are new technical departments being formed every month, but even some more mature departments are constantly being impacted by new technologies and undergoing fundamental changes. The development of engineering technology is increasingly supported by scientific foundations. It is difficult to adapt to such requirements if the division of labor is too detailed and students are trained too rigidly. The historical experience of professional settings in Soviet higher industrial education also proves this point. Around 1932, the Soviet Union had as many as nine hundred majors, but now there are only more than one hundred, and it is still considering expanding the scope of majors and merging some majors. The Soviet Union's industry is more than ten times larger than ours, and the opportunities to match are more than ten times greater. If they are like this, our majors need to be merged even more. For example, in our country, the mechanical engineering majors are divided into more than forty majors, and many majors are further divided into specializations. It is really worth thinking about whether this is necessary.

In short, we should be realistic in dealing with the issue of training objectives. If we can give up the requirement that students become engineers as soon as they graduate, and regard the training of higher industrial schools as the basic training for engineers, this will provide us with the possibility of training higher-quality industrial construction talents for the motherland.

Specifically, we should strengthen basic training and abandon some of the excessive and fragmented purely empirical professional knowledge that does not need to be learned in school. First of all, we should give basic theoretical courses enough extracurricular self-study time so that students can consolidate their basic theoretical knowledge and be able to use it skillfully through sufficient independent work. It is not necessarily necessary to increase the classroom teaching time for these courses, but it is necessary to lengthen their study period, spread them out, and free up enough extracurricular time. Secondly, we must strengthen the training of basic technical courses, and pay special attention to the proficiency of these trainings. The classroom teaching time for some courses (such as electrical engineering for mechanical engineering majors) should be restored to the necessary amount. The experimental training of all basic courses should also be greatly strengthened. In professional courses, we should improve the quality of lectures in major professional courses and ensure the necessary typical and economically significant practical knowledge of production. Other non-major, marginal professional courses and general specialized courses should be greatly streamlined, or cancelled, or changed to electives, or the main content that must be taught should be incorporated into the major professional courses. Some necessary reference materials can be printed and distributed to students as references in design training. Production internships, course design, and graduation design should be maintained in principle, but there are still many that can be merged and reduced. Some design work that is too formalistic can also be greatly improved or even cancelled.

The quality of teaching in higher education institutions is not only measured by the sum of the amount of knowledge taught to students, but more importantly, by cultivating students' ability to acquire more knowledge on the basis of the knowledge they have already acquired, and to organize this knowledge to serve a specific production. Therefore, teaching too much and too tediously, and instilling students with as much knowledge as in an encyclopedia, cannot achieve the goal of improving quality.

Today, the teaching problem in higher industrial schools is a contradiction between quality and quantity. We can only solve this problem by streamlining the number of courses, strengthening basic training, and strengthening the cultivation of students' independent working ability. Our proposal today is not to deny the achievements we have made in learning from the Soviet Union and carrying out teaching reforms, let alone to turn back, but to oppose being satisfied with the achievements we have already made and stopping there. We must move forward on the basis of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.

Affirmatively, engineer is the direction of our higher industrial school training, but it cannot be used as the goal of five years of training.

Postscript: The Guangming Daily published my talk on the training objectives of higher industrial schools, which aroused discussions in various aspects. However, this manuscript was not reviewed by me before it was printed, and some places, such as the words "foundation, that is, mathematics, physics, and chemistry," were oversimplified, which also caused unnecessary misunderstandings. Now I would like to make some further explanations on this issue.

    高等工业学校的培养目标问题
    钱伟长
    高等工业学校的培养目标问题是教学工作的中心问题。教学改革以前，高等工业学校教学工作是漫无目标的通才教学。在学习苏联经验进行教学改革以后，我们学到了环绕一个明确目标进行有计划的教学工作的一整套的制度和方法。这是很大的进步。我们的培养目标是按照苏联教学计划的规定翻译过来的某某工程师。我们的教学要求也就大体上根据各个教师对于工程师三个字的各自了解来决定。教学质量在某些方面看是提高了，但是学生学习负担过重，独立工作能力较差，专业分得过细过专，以致在分配就业时发生了困难。这都不符合我们国家的要求，值得我们研究改进。有经验的工程师雷天觉副院长对于目前高等学校毕业生有过这样的估价：他们“初到工厂，因为学过一些专业知识，马上可以担任某些工作，这是他们的好处。但是由于他们的基础理论打得不够深广，在工作中很快就暴露出缺点，无论在解决技术问题上或是提高科学技术水平上，都有难于克服的困难”。今天的教学工作中有一个明确目标是好的，但是目标定得过高过死是造成学生学习负担过重等主要的原因之一。由于过分地强调了学生出门就要做某某工程师的要求，专业课就显得庞大复杂，把一切纯经验性的专业生产知识不加选择地搬进了课堂。另一方面，忽视了基础理论课和基础技术课必需有足够的课外时间让学生进行独立自学的原则，把这些课都挤在低年级里，每周上课达三十五六小时，那么在每周五十四小时的学习时限下，还剩多少时间给学生独立工作呢？今天的问题，不是我们不培养学生独立工作的能力，而是学生在学校内根本缺乏独立工作的机会和时间。同时，由于过分地强调了专业课，以致基础技术课这样重要的环节，不论在师资上在教学工作上都是过分地削弱了。就是在专业课里，不少有经验的教授在开设次要的专门化课程上多花了力量，而常常把主要的专业课让给经验较少的青年教师开。
    国家是不是要求高等工业学校的毕业生出门就当工程师呢？显然并不是这样的。虽然在过去高等工业学校一再强调要培养工程师。但是，毕业生在实际上进入生产岗位时的级称是见习技术员。这就是说，高等工业学校毕业生还需要一定的实际工作的经验才能执行工程师的职务和给予几等几级工程师的级称。要求高等工业学校的毕业生出门就当工程师，就好像要求综合大学的毕业生出门就当科学院的研究员或大学里的讲师一样，是不现实的、过高的。当然，在国家建设事业飞速发展的情况下，有大学初毕业的个别助教在课堂上讲课，有初毕业的个别技术员做了工程师的工作。这也是可以的。
    高等工业学校的毕业生虽然具备了工程师的基础知识，在校期间并受到了关于工程师的基本训练，但是，毕业后，还需要经过一定时期的生产锻炼，才能胜任工程师的工作。这是明显的了。可是，还有人觉得，高等工业学校的毕业生既然具备了工程师的基础知识，给予工程师的称号又有何妨呢？也有人武断地说，我们就叫这样的人为工程师又有什么不可以呢？当然，假如你一定要这样叫，也是未尝不可以的，只是同我们的社会习惯和常识了解，总是有着距离的。
    那末，为什么苏联的高等工业学校培养目标是“工程师”呢？这是在帝俄时代遗留下来的习惯，这同德国的习惯也是一致的。日本模仿了德国的教学制度，把高等工业学校毕业生这个称号就翻译成“工学士”，其实它只是代表受有一定的工程基本训练的“工程人员”，它只是代表“高等工业学校毕业生”的意义。这个“工程师”的称号，和我国习惯上沿用的“工程师级称”的要求是有着一定的距离的。假如我们把苏联高等工业学校培养目标的“工程师”的要求，和我国习用的“工程师级称”的要求混为一谈，就必然会造成对高等工业学校教学工作的过高要求。
    把高等工业学校培养目标具体地规定为“某某工程师”的另一后果，必然是过细过专的专业设置。因为工程师的具体工作，由于技术的不断发展，总是愈分愈细的。假如我们追求着一出门就当工程师的目标，则必然在学校内也要求设置又细又专的专业。我们姑且不谈为了追求过细过专的训练而忽视了必要的基础训练所招来的恶劣的后果，就是勉强保证了起码的基础训练，过细过专的专门训练是不是能够和国家的需要对上口径呢？从这几年来分配工作的经验看来，显然是很难对上口径的。口径愈细，愈不易对上，毕业生愈易感觉他“改行”。表面上好像由于分了过细的专业而使培养目标“明确”了，好像保证了毕业生一出门就能做这样那样的工程师，实际上毕业生因为专业分得过细对不上口径，大量“改行”，还得从头学起，再加上基础不够，事倍功半。我们并不是说在什么情况下都不能分得较细，订定目标，来按计划培养的。但是，这只有在工业发展比较定型的情况下，按不变的比例发展着，技术上没有什么革命性的变化时才是可能的。像1930年间一些较成熟的专业就有过这样的稳定情况。但是，我们国家的具体情况不是这样的，国家工业发展的比例起着急剧的变化。我们今天处于一个技术迅速发展变化的时代，不仅每月都有新的技术部门在形成，就是一些比较成熟的部门，也不断受到新技术的撞击而起着根本性的变革，工程技术的发展愈来愈取得科学基础的支持。分工过细，对学生进行过分刻板的培养，就很难适应这样的要求。苏联高等工业教育中专业设置的历史经验，也正证明了这一点。在1932年左右，苏联曾设置了多至九百个专业，现在只有一百多个，并且还在考虑扩大专业范围，合并一些专业。苏联的工业比我们大十几倍，对上口径的机会就多十几倍，他们尚且如此，我们的专业更需要合并。比如我国目前在机械方面的专业，就分了四十多个，很多专业还分着专门化，实在值得想一想这样究竟是不是必要。
    总之，我们应该实事求是地对待培养目标问题，如果我们能够放弃使学生一毕业就当工程师的要求，而把高等工业学校的训练看作是工程师的基础训练，这就给我们为祖国培养更高质量的工业建设人才提供了可能性。
    具体说来，我们应该加强基础训练，放弃一些过多的同时可以不必在学校内学习的零碎的纯经验性的专业知识。首先我们应该给予基础理论课足够充分的课外自学时间，使学生通过足够的独立工作，能够巩固基础理论知识并且做到运用熟练。这里不一定还需要增加这类课程的课堂教学时间，但有必要拉长它们的学习期限，求得分散开来，腾出足够的课外时间。其次，要加强基础技术课的训练，尤其要注意这些训练的熟练性。有些课程（像机械专业的电工学）的课堂教学时间，应该恢复到必要的数量。所有基础课程的实验训练也应该大大地加强。在专业课里，应该提高主要专业课的讲课质量，保证必要的典型性的和有广泛经济意义的生产实际知识。其他非主要的，枝节性的专业课程和一般专门化课程，应该大量精简，或是取消，或是改为选修，或把非讲不可的主要内容并入主要专业课中讲授。有些必要的资料性质的教材，可以印发给学生，作为设计训练中的参考。生产实习、课程设计和毕业设计在原则上应该保持，但是，应该还有不少可以合并和减少的，有一些过于形式化的设计工作，也可以大大改进，甚或取消。
    高等学校的教学工作的质量，并不仅仅是用教给学生的知识数量的总和来衡量的，更重要的，是培养学生如何在已经获得的知识基础上去获得更多的知识，组织这些知识为某一个特定的生产服务。因此，过多地、过分繁琐地进行教学，灌输给学生以百科全书那样多的知识，并不能达到提高质量的目的。
    今天高等工业学校的教学问题是质与量的矛盾。我们只有精简课程数量、加强基础训练、加强学生独立工作能力的培养，才能解决这个问题。我们今天提出这个问题，并不是否定我们学习苏联，进行教学改革的成果，更不是走回头路，而是反对满足于已经获得的成就，停止不前。我们要在学习苏联先进经验的基础上进一步前进。
    肯定地说，工程师是我们高等工业学校培养的方向，但是不能作为五年培养的目标。
    附记：光明日报发表我的关于高等工业学校的培养目标的谈话，引起了各方面的讨论。但是这个谈话稿付印前并未经过本人过目，有些地方如基础即数理化等词句，过分简单化了些，因此也引起了不必要的误会。现在愿就这个问题再作一些说明。
