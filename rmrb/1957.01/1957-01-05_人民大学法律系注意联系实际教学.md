Xinhua News Agency, 4th - The teachers of the Criminal Law Teaching and Research Office of the Law Department of Renmin University of China are paying attention to linking their teaching with the actual situation of judicial work in China, in order to improve the quality of teaching.

In the past, the Law Department of Renmin University of China has been using Soviet textbooks for teaching. Because of the lack of connection with China's actual situation, students often felt that their understanding was not deep. Since last year, teachers in the Law Department have begun to pay frequent attention to linking the lectures with the situation of judicial practice since the founding of New China to explain the problems. For example, when talking about the definition of "crime," the teachers not only abstractly analyze the basic characteristics of crime, but also link it with specific cases, so that students can accurately understand the boundary between crime and non-crime.

In order to gain practical knowledge, this semester, the students of the Law Department have gone to the court to listen to trials and visit prisons three times. During classroom discussions, teachers consciously introduce some of the currently debated issues in criminal law theory among jurists to the students, encourage students to put forward positive and negative opinions, and inspire students to think independently.

The teachers also guide students in scientific research activities. They borrow criminal judgments from the courts in Xuanwu, Qianmen, Xisi, Haidian and other districts of Beijing from 1952 to the present and give them to the students as materials for special research. They also absorb some students to participate in scientific report meetings held by the teaching and research office, or help students organize their own scientific debate meetings. After these measures, students generally felt that the learning effect was better than before.

    人民大学法律系注意联系实际教学
    新华社4日讯　中国人民大学法律系刑法教研室的教师们在教学中注意联系中国司法工作的实际，以提高教学质量。
    中国人民大学法律系过去一直是采用苏联的教材教学，由于和中国的实际情况缺乏联系，学生们常常感到理解不深。去年以来，法律系的教师们在讲课中开始经常注意联系新中国成立以来司法实践中的情况，说明问题。例如讲到“犯罪”定义的时候，教师们不只是抽象地分析犯罪的几个基本特征，而且联系具体案例，使学生确切地了解了罪与非罪的界线。
    为了获得实际知识，这个学期中，法律系的学生们已经到法院去旁听审讯和参观监狱三次。在课堂讨论时，教师们还有意识地把目前法学家们对刑法理论上的一些有争论的问题介绍给学生们，鼓励学生提出正面和反面的意见，启发学生们独立思考。
    教师们还指导学生进行科学研究活动，他们把北京市宣武、前门、西四、海淀等区的法院从1952年到目前的刑事判决书借来交给学生，作为专题研究的材料。并且吸收一些学生参加教研室举行的科学报告会，或帮助学生自己组织科学争辩会。经过这些措施以后，学生们普遍感到学习效果比以前好。
