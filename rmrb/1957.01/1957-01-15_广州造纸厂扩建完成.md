    Guangzhou Paper Mill Expansion Completed

    (Our report) The expansion project of China's largest newsprint manufacturer, the state-owned Guangzhou Paper Mill, is now basically complete. Before the expansion in 1953, the mill only produced more than 11,000 tons of newsprint annually. After the expansion, it can produce more than 60,000 tons of newsprint and more than 15,000 tons of pulp board annually. The newsprint produced in one day is enough to print more than 8 million broadsheet newspapers.

    The paper machine put into production in the factory last December is currently the largest paper machine in China. If this machine operates at its fastest speed, it can produce 450 meters of newsprint, 3.99 meters wide, per minute. The newsprint produced in just over three days is as long as the railway tracks from Guangzhou to Beijing. (According to the Southern Daily) (Attached photo)

    广州造纸厂扩建完成
    本报讯　我国最大的新闻纸制造厂——国营广州造纸厂的扩建工程现在已经基本完成。1953年扩建以前，这个厂每年只产新闻纸一万一千多吨，扩建完成以后，每年可产新闻纸六万多吨、纸浆板一万五千多吨；一天生产的新闻纸就可以印对开报纸八百多万份。
    这个厂去年12月投入生产的抄纸机是目前我国最大的一台抄纸机。这台机器如果以最快速度运转，每分钟可产宽三点九九公尺的新闻纸四百五十公尺。三天多所产的新闻纸，等于广州到北京的铁路钢轨一样长。　（据南方日报）（附图片）
