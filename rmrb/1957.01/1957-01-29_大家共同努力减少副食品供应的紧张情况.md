    Everyone Work Together to Reduce the Tension in the Supply of Non-Staple Foods
    Shao Likun
    Since the third quarter of last year, Beijing has experienced a situation where the supply of non-staple foods has fallen short of demand, especially the supply of meat and eggs. To buy meat, one has to wait in line for a long time, and sometimes it is not even possible to buy it. Therefore, many people simply complain that the Beijing Food Company is supplying too few non-staple foods.
    Has the supply of non-staple foods by the Beijing Food Company decreased compared to the past? No, the supply of non-staple foods has been increasing year by year. In 1956, the Beijing Food Company supplied the market with 90,040 cattle, 345,261 sheep, and 21 million jin of eggs. Compared with the supply in 1955, the number of cattle increased by 47%, sheep increased by 45%, and eggs increased by 15%. Some people say that the population of Beijing has increased a lot last year, but the supply of non-staple foods has not increased proportionally. This statement is also incorrect. According to statistics from the Beijing Municipal People's Committee Statistics Bureau not long ago, Beijing currently has a population of about four million, an increase of 13% compared to 1955, while the proportion of the increase in the supply of many non-staple foods has exceeded this figure.
    In the past year, the Beijing Food Company has done a lot of work and achieved considerable results to ensure the supply of non-staple foods. In order to ensure supply, the Beijing Food Company boarded a large number of live cattle and sheep transferred from various places in agricultural cooperatives not far from Beijing, such as Daxing, Sanhe, Changping, and Tongxian, which solved the company's difficulty of insufficient storage conditions and also helped the agricultural cooperatives accumulate fertilizer. Last year, the company also repeatedly sent people to various producing areas to organize supplies and expand reserves. In order to do a good job in supplying the market during the New Year's Day and Spring Festival this year, as early as mid-November last year, more than 30 people, including managers and section chiefs, were transferred to form five working groups, which went to Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hailar, Qinghai, Hebei and other places to supervise the producing areas to deliver goods according to plan and vigorously organize supplies beyond the plan. The working group in Inner Mongolia, in order to get the sheep transported to Beijing before New Year's Day, braved the long journey in the severe winter and drove 20,000 to 30,000 sheep from Xilingol League to Zhangjiakou.
    The main reason for the tight supply of non-staple foods in Beijing is not that the supply of non-staple foods has decreased compared to the past, nor is it that the work of the food company is too bad, but that the living standards of the people in Beijing have improved, and the increase in the demand for non-staple foods has exceeded the level of development of non-staple food production. Especially after the increase in the number of employed people and the wage reform last year, the income of workers, cadres, and citizens has increased, and the contradiction between the supply and demand of non-staple foods in the market has become even more prominent.
    Of course, the shortcomings in the past work of the Beijing Food Company are also related to the tight supply of non-staple foods to a certain extent. It should be pointed out that the food company has not done a good job in the storage and preservation of non-staple foods. In the operation of non-staple foods, there are also problems with too many circulation links. Farmers sell eggs to vendors, who then sell them to grass-roots supply and marketing cooperatives. Then, they have to go through county supply and marketing cooperatives, county (city) food companies, and some even have to be concentrated in the prefectural food companies before they can be packaged and shipped to Beijing. After four or five circulations, not only is the quality of the eggs reduced, but also the loss rate of the eggs is increased, and the cost of the eggs is increased. The eggs transported from various producing areas to Beijing are generally half a month to twenty days old. Generally, defective eggs account for 5%; in hot weather, defective products increase to 30%-40%, and even reach more than 80%.
    In order to reduce the tight supply of non-staple foods, the Beijing Food Company is working hard to improve its management and operation. They plan to store eggs using sodium silicate solution during the peak season for egg marketing from March to July; they also plan to make frozen eggs and pickled salted eggs to regulate the needs of the off-season market, especially the supply during festivals. In order to build pools for storing eggs, the Ministry of Commerce has approved 250,000 yuan as funding. After the pools are built, plus the company's existing equipment, it is estimated that 8 million to 10 million jin of eggs can be stored.
    However, in order to change the current tight market supply situation, in addition to the efforts of the commercial departments, it also requires the general consumers to have a correct understanding of the tight supply of non-staple foods, to understand the current difficulties of the country, and to appropriately reduce the consumption of meat and eggs. In particular, cadres of state organs and troops should carry forward the fine tradition of sharing weal and woe with the masses and practice thrift.

### 大家共同努力减少副食品供应的紧张情况

    大家共同努力减少副食品供应的紧张情况
    邵礼昆
    去年第三季度以后，北京市出现了副食品供不应求的情况，特别是肉、蛋类的供应情况更为紧张。要买肉，就要排很长时间的队，有时候还买不到肉。因此，不少人就一味埋怨北京市食品公司供应的副食品太少了。
    去年北京市食品公司副食品的供应量比过去减少了吗？没有，副食品的供应量是逐年增加的。1956年，北京市食品公司供应市场九万零四十头牛，三十四万五千二百六十一只羊，二千一百万斤鸡蛋，和1955年供应量相比，牛增加了47％，羊增加了45％，鸡蛋增加了15％。有人说：去年北京市的人口增加很多，但副食品的供应却没有相应按比例地增加。这种说法也不正确。据北京市人民委员会统计局不久以前的统计：北京市现约有人口四百万，比1955年增长了13％，而许多副食品供应数量增长的比例，都已超过了这个数字。
    在过去一年中，北京市食品公司为了保证副食品供应，曾做了很多工作，也做出了不少成绩。为了保证供应，北京市食品公司把大批从各地调来的活牛、羊寄养在大兴、三河、昌平、通县等离北京不远的农业社里，解决了公司储备条件不足的困难，也帮助农业社积了肥。去年，这个公司还屡次派人深入各个产区去组织货源，扩大储备。为了做好今年元旦和春节的供应工作，早在去年11月中旬，就抽调了经理、科长等三十多人，组成五个工作组，分赴内蒙古、甘肃、陕西、山西、山东、河南、安徽、海拉尔、青海、河北等地，督促产地按计划交货，并大力组织计划外的货源。到内蒙古的工作组，为了争取在元旦前把羊运到北京，在严寒的冬天，不怕长途跋踄，把二、三万只羊从锡林郭勒盟赶到张家口。
    北京市副食品供应紧张的主要原因，不是副食品的供应量比过去减少了，也不是食品公司的工作太糟糕，而是北京市人民生活水平提高了，副食品需要量的增多，超过了副食品生产发展的水平。尤其在去年从业人数增多和工资改革以后，职工、干部和市民们的收入增多了，市场副食品的供应和需要之间的矛盾就更显得突出了。
    北京市食品公司过去工作中的缺点，当然也同副食品供应情况的紧张有一定的关系。应该指出的是：食品公司对副食品的储备和保管工作是做得不够好的。在副食品的经营中，也还有流转环节过多的毛病。农民把蛋卖给小贩，经小贩手再卖给基层供销社，接着还要经过县供销社、县（市）食品公司，有的还要到专区食品公司集中，以后才能包装起运到北京。经过四、五次流转以后，不但降低了蛋的质量，也增加了蛋的损耗率，提高了蛋的成本。各产地运到北京的鸡蛋，一般都是半月、二十天以前的。其中残次蛋一般要占5％；天热的时候，残次品增加到30％—40％，甚至曾达到80％以上。
    北京市食品公司为了减少副食品供应紧张的情况，正在努力改善经营管理工作。他们计划在3月到7月鸡蛋上市的旺季，用泡花碱溶液贮蛋的方法把蛋贮藏起来；还准备打冰蛋，腌咸蛋，以调剂淡季市场的需要，特别是节日的供应。为了建造贮蛋的池子，商业部已批准给他们二十五万元作为经费。池子建成后，加上这个公司原有的设备，估计可储蛋八百万斤到一千万斤。
    但是，要改变目前市场供应的紧张情况，除了商业部门要努力以外，还需要广大消费者对副食品供应紧张的情况有正确的认识，体谅国家目前的困难，适当减少肉类、蛋类的消费。尤其是国家机关、部队的干部，更要发扬与群众同甘共苦的优良传统，励行节约。
