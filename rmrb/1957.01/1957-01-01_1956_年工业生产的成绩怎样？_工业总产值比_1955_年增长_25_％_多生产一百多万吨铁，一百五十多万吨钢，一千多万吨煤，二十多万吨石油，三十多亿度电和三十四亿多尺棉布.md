Xinhua News Agency, December 31st: In 1956, China's industrial production surged to unprecedented heights, exceeding the annual industrial gross output value plan by more than 4%. At the same time, the industrial gross output value plan and the output plans for many products for the last year of the Five-Year Plan were declared completed one year ahead of schedule.

According to preliminary calculations by the State Statistical Bureau, China's total industrial output value in 1956 reached more than 55.8 billion yuan, completing the industrial gross output value plan for the last year of the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule and exceeding it by more than 4%.

1956 was a year in which China's industrial production developed at a relatively rapid pace in recent years. The total industrial output value increased by more than 11 billion yuan compared to 1955, with a growth rate of 25%. The average growth rate of industrial production during the Five-Year Plan is 14.7%; the average growth rate of industrial production in the first four years of China's Five-Year Plan also greatly exceeded the average annual growth rate of industrial production during the Five-Year Plan. (Editor's note: The growth rate of total industrial output value in recent years is: 33% increase in 1953 compared to 1952, 17% increase in 1954 compared to 1953, and 8% increase in 1955 compared to 1954.)

The policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry enabled the production of means of production in China to continue to maintain a higher growth rate than that of the entire industry in 1956. Compared with the previous year, the output of major heavy industrial products in 1956 increased by more than one million tons of iron, more than one and a half million tons of steel, more than one million one hundred thousand tons of steel products, more than eleven million five hundred thousand tons of coal, more than two hundred and ten thousand tons of petroleum, more than one million nine hundred thousand tons of cement, more than three billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, more than eight thousand metal-cutting machine tools, alternating current generators with a total capacity of 170,000 kilowatts, 120,000 tons of ammonium sulfate, and many other products such as steam boilers, locomotives, steam turbines, and hydraulic turbines.

While prioritizing the development of heavy industry, China more actively developed light industry in 1956. Therefore, the production of consumer goods also increased significantly compared to 1955, and the growth rate was also one of the fastest in recent years. In 1956, China produced more than 5.1 million bales of yarn, 13.8 billion feet of cotton cloth, more than 25 million feet of worsted wool fabrics, 93 million pairs of rubber shoes, more than 710,000 tons of machine-made paper, more than 4.31 million tons of flour, 910,000 tons of edible vegetable oil, 520,000 tons of machine-made sugar, and 129.8 billion units of penicillin (equivalent to more than 40 million ordinary-sized bottles) in terms of consumer goods. Compared with the previous year, the output of these products in 1956 increased by more than 3.4 billion feet of cotton cloth, equivalent to more than five feet per person nationwide. In addition, more than ten million city feet of worsted wool fabrics, more than 140,000 tons of machine-made paper, more than 3.3 million pairs of rubber shoes, more than 210,000 bicycles, more than 10,000 tons of edible vegetable oil, more than 110,000 tons of sugar, and many other products were also produced.

Among the above-mentioned light and heavy industrial products and other products included in the Five-Year Plan, a total of 46 products, more than 20 products have completed the 1957 output plan stipulated in the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule, including steel, iron, steel products, generators, steam turbines, hydraulic turbines, steam boilers, machine tools, cement, soda ash, caustic soda, ammonium nitrate, automobile tires, machine-made paper, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, etc. In addition, the output of some products is also close to the 1957 level.

Under the guidance of the central government's policy of fully utilizing and appropriately developing coastal industrial areas, the total industrial output value of the seven coastal provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, and Liaoning, and the three municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai in 1956 grew faster than in any of the past three years, and faster than the national industrial development speed this year. The means of production produced by the industrial production in the coastal areas strongly supported the construction in the inland areas, and at the same time, supplied most of the industrial daily necessities needed by the whole country.

As an important indicator of good or bad industrial management—production costs—were also lower in 1956 than in the previous year. The industrial costs of the eleven central industrial ministries alone were reduced by more than 600 million yuan in the first eleven months.

The technical level of China's industrial production also improved significantly in 1956. In 1956, in addition to being able to produce jet aircraft, heavy-duty vehicles, and trial-produce a large number of new products, the utilization rate of major production equipment in China was further improved. The equipment utilization rate in industries such as steel, machinery, and cement increased by 8% to 20%. The raw material consumption quotas in many production departments were lower than in the previous year, and the Ministry of Electric Power saved more than 300,000 tons of coal by reducing the coal consumption quota.

However, some products failed to complete the 1956 production plan due to lack of raw materials or overly ambitious plans. The production coordination and safe production work of some industrial departments were not done well enough.

At this time of bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new, the achievements and shortcomings of the past year are encouraging and reminding people to draw wisdom and strength from them, to strive to produce more wealth in 1957, and to better carry out industrial management. At present, many industrial departments are reviewing or summarizing the work of the past year. Many departments' vivid facts show that the central government's slogan of opposing right-leaning conservative ideology, the enthusiasm of millions of workers in building socialism, and the advanced producer movement throughout the country played a decisive role in enabling China's industrial production to reach such a high level in 1956, in addition to objective conditions such as the agricultural harvest of the previous year.

    1956年工业生产的成绩怎样？
    工业总产值比1955年增长25％
    多生产一百多万吨铁，一百五十多万吨钢，一千多万吨煤，二十多万吨石油，三十多亿度电和三十四亿多尺棉布
    新华社31日讯　1956年我国工业生产空前高涨，超额4％以上完成了本年度的工业总产值计划。同时，五年计划最后一年的工业总产值计划和许多产品的产量计划，提前一年宣告完成。
    据国家统计局初步计算，1956年我国工业生产总值达五百五十八亿多元，提前一年并超额4％以上完成了五年计划最后一年的工业总产值计划。
    1956年是我国近几年来工业生产发展速度比较快的一年，工业总产值比1955年增加了一百一十多亿元，增长速度为25％。五年计划工业生产增长的平均速度是14.7％；我国五年计划前四年工业生产的平均增长速度，也大大超过了五年计划工业生产的每年平均增长速度。（编者注：近几年来工业总产值增长的速度是：1953年比1952年增长33％，1954年比1953年增长17％，1955年比1954年增长8％。）
    优先发展重工业的方针，使1956年我国生产资料的生产继续保持了高于全部工业的发展速度。主要重工业产品的产量同前一年相比，1956年多生产了一百多万吨铁，一百五十多万吨钢，一百一十多万吨钢材，一千一百五十多万吨煤，二十一万多吨石油，一百九十多万吨水泥，三十多亿度电，八千多台金属切削机床，总容量十七万瓩的交流发电机，十二万吨硫铵，以及许多蒸汽锅炉、机车、汽轮机、水轮机等产品。
    在优先发展重工业的同时，1956年我国更加积极地发展了轻工业，因此，消费资料的生产也比1955年有很大增长，增长速度也是近几年来比较快的一年。1956年在消费资料方面，我国共生产了五百一十多万件纱，一百三十八亿尺棉布，二千五百多万尺精纺毛织品，九千三百万双胶鞋，七十一万多吨机制纸，四百三十一万多吨面粉，九十一万吨食用植物油，五十二万多吨机制糖，十二万九千八百亿单位青霉素（相当于普通用的那样大的瓶四千多万瓶）。这些产品的产量同前一年相比，1956年多生产了三十四亿多尺棉布，等于为全国每人多生产了五尺多。另外，还多生产了一千多万市尺精纺毛织品，十四万多吨机制纸，三百三十万双胶鞋，二十一万多辆自行车，一万多吨食用植物油，十一万多吨糖，以及许多其它产品。
    上述轻重工业产品和其它列入五年计划的产品一共四十六种产品中，有二十多种产品提前一年完成了五年计划规定的1957年的产量计划，其中有钢、铁、钢材、发电机、汽轮机、水轮机、蒸汽锅炉、机床、水泥、纯碱、烧碱、硝铵、汽车外胎、机制纸、棉纱、棉布等。另外还有一些产品的产量也接近1957年的水平。
    在中央提出的充分利用和适当发展近海地区工业的方针指导下，1956年近海地区广东、福建、浙江、江苏、山东、河北、辽宁七省和北京、天津、上海三市的工业总产值，比近三年任何一年增长都快，并且快于本年全国工业发展的速度。近海地区工业生产的生产资料，有力地支援了内地的建设，同时，还供应了全国所需要的大部分工业日用品。
    作为工业经营管理好坏的重要标志——生产成本，1956年也比前一年降低了。仅是中央十一个工业部前十一个月的工业成本，就降低了六亿多元。
    我国工业生产的技术水平，1956年也显著的提高了。1956年我国除了已经能生产喷气式飞机、载重汽车和试制了大批的新产品以外，主要生产设备的利用率也有了进一步提高，钢铁、机械、水泥等工业的设备利用率，提高了8％到20％。许多生产部门的原材料消耗定额都比前一年有所降低，电力工业部由于降低煤的消耗定额，节省了三十多万吨煤。
    但是，有些产品由于缺乏原料或计划偏高等原因，没有完成1956年的生产计划。有些工业部门的生产协作和安全生产工作，还作得不好。
    在这送旧迎新之际，过去一年的成就、缺点正鼓舞和提醒着人们，从中吸取智慧和力量，来争取1957年生产更多的财富，更好地进行工业管理。目前，许多工业部门都在回顾或总结过去一年的工作，许多部门生动的事实表明，1956年我国工业生产能够达到这样的高涨，除前一年农业丰收等客观条件以外，中央提出的反对右倾保守思想的口号，千百万职工们建设社会主义的积极性，以及遍及全国的先进生产者运动等，起了决定性的作用。
