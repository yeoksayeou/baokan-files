    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow. The Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station on the Angara River in Siberia has begun generating electricity. The first test-run unit is operating well. The substations and high-voltage transmission lines are in perfect working order. The power station will supply electricity for industrial use.

    Currently, the Irkutsk Reservoir has accumulated approximately 700 million cubic meters of water. The water level difference between upstream and downstream of the hydraulic hub reaches 15 meters.

    The Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station is the first completed project in the cascade of hydroelectric power stations on the Angara River, and one of the largest hydraulic construction projects in the Sixth Five-Year Plan. It produces electricity at a low cost, unmatched by any other hydroelectric power station built in the Soviet Union. The cost of each kilowatt-hour of electricity from this hydroelectric power station will be one kopek cheaper than from ordinary power stations. Once all the units are put into operation, the hydroelectric power station will have a generating capacity of 660,000 kilowatts and generate 4.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. The second turbine will begin operating in early January.

    苏联新五年计划中最大水利建设之一
    伊尔库次克水电站开始发电
    新华社莫斯科电　西伯利亚安加拉河上的伊尔库次克水力发电站发电了。第一台试车的联动机运转情况良好。变电所和高压输电线情况完全正常。发电站将供应工业用电。
    现在，伊尔库次克水库已经蓄水约七亿立方公尺。水利枢纽上游和下游之间的水位差别达十五公尺。
    伊尔库次克水力发电站是安加拉河水力发电站阶梯上第一个已经完成的工程，这是第六个五年计划中最大的水利建设工程之一。它生产的电力成本低廉，是苏联任何一个已经建成的水电站所比不上的。这个水电站每一度电力的成本将比普通电站便宜一戈比。全部联动机投入生产之后，水力发电站的发电能力将达六十六万瓩，每年发电四十五亿度。第二台水轮机将在1月初开始运转。
