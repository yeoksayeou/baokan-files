Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: According to Cairo Radio, the Yemeni ambassador to Egypt, Said Abu Taleb, stated in Cairo on January 12th that the Yemeni government considers that British aggression against Yemen has abrogated the 1934 British-Yemeni treaty and the 1951 agreement signed by the two countries.

    The 1934 treaty stipulated peaceful mediation of disputes between Yemen and Britain. According to the 1951 agreement, the two countries established diplomatic and economic relations.

Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: TASS, London: The Yemeni Embassy in London issued a statement on January 12th denying an Aden news report appearing in the press that Yemen had issued a general mobilization order.

    The statement said: "The purpose of spreading this news is mainly to propagate and distort some facts that form the basis of recent events. The Yemeni Embassy in London reiterates its previous statement: Yemen has not committed any aggression against the so-called Aden Protectorate."

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, January 12th: According to the Pakistan Press International, political figures here have expressed great concern about the disturbing situation in the Yemen-Aden region. They expressed sympathy for the Yemeni people and have complained to the Secretary-General of the United Nations about the British attack on Yemen.

    The "Today's News" editorial published on January 11th said that although Western imperialists have suffered a shameful defeat in Egypt, they are still trying to undermine peace in the Middle East and undermine the independence of Arab countries. "This clearly proves that if the Middle East is threatened, then this threat comes from Western imperialism and not from any other source."

    The newspaper said: "If President Eisenhower is truly a friend of the Arab countries, if he sincerely believes that the integrity of these countries should be maintained, he should immediately announce his support for Yemen. But he will never do so."

    也门宣称英国侵略行动已废弃了两国条约
    巴报指出也门事件证明中东的威胁来自帝国主义
    新华社13日讯　据开罗电台广播，也门驻埃及公使赛义德·阿布·塔列布12日在开罗发表声明说，也门政府认为，英国对也门的侵略行动已经废弃了1934年的英国—也门条约和1951年两国签订的协定。
    1934年的条约规定要和平调解也门和英国之间的争端。根据1951年的协定，两国建立了外交关系和经济关系。
    新华社13日讯　塔斯社伦敦讯：也门驻伦敦公使馆12日发表声明，否认报上出现的说也门已下总动员令的一则亚丁消息。
    声明中说：“散布这一消息，其目的主要是宣传和歪曲一些作为最近事件的基础的事实。也门驻伦敦公使馆重申它以前的声明：也门并没有对所谓亚丁保护地作任何侵犯。”
    据新华社卡拉奇12日电　据巴基斯坦联合通讯社报道，这里的政界人士对也门—亚丁地区的令人不安的局势表示非常关切。他们对也门人表示同情，并且已经向联合国秘书长控诉英国对也门的进攻。
    “今天报”在1月11日发表的社论中说，尽管西方帝国主义者已经在埃及遭到了可耻的失败，他们还在设法破坏中东的和平，破坏阿拉伯国家的独立。“这一点清楚地证明，如果说中东遭到威胁的话，那么这种威胁是来自西方帝国主义而不是来自任何其他方面”。
    这家报纸说：“如果艾森豪威尔总统真是阿拉伯国家的朋友，如果他真诚地认为应该维护这些国家的完整，他应当立即宣布他支持也门。但是他决不会这样做”。
