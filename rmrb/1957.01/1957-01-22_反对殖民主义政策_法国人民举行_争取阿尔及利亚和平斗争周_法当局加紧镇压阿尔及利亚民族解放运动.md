Xinhua News Agency, January 21st: On the eve of the United Nations' discussion of the Algerian question, French authorities are intensifying their suppression of the Algerian national liberation movement.

    According to Western news agency reports: General Massu, commander of the French forces in Algiers, has transferred the French Foreign Legion withdrawn from Egypt into the city. Large numbers of fully equipped security forces, paratroopers of the Foreign Legion, and other troops patrolled the streets everywhere on the 20th, and helicopters circled and guarded the city's airspace. Massu also ordered the doors of any stores holding strikes to be "forced open" in an attempt to stop citizens from responding to the "Algerian National Liberation Front's" call for a strike. The French Resident Minister in Algeria, Lacoste, has ordered a ban on local newspapers from publishing any news of the strikes.

    In the provinces of Aumale, Constantine, and other places, multiple battles occurred on the 20th between the French colonial army and Algerian insurgents.
