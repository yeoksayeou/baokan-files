Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 26th - Secretary of State Dulles testified for the fourth time on the 25th before a joint session of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees regarding the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and he continued to be questioned by senators.

Democratic Senator Morse spent almost the entire morning session posing a series of questions to Dulles. He demanded assurances that the United States would not "go it alone" in the Middle East and should try to take military action alongside Britain and France in the future.

He advocated stipulating that the President obtain special authorization from Congress before sending troops to the Middle East. He said that the danger of using the current doctrine to "launch a preventive war" should be made "impossible."

In his response, Dulles stated that the United States was not prepared to take joint action with Britain and France in its Middle East policy. He said that, due to the reception British and French soldiers had received in the Middle East, "If I were an American boy, as you say, going to fight in the Middle East, I would rather not have French and British soldiers on either side of me. I think I would feel much safer that way."

Dulles said that if Britain and France were asked to participate in the new U.S. policy, he did not know what attitude they would take. He said, "I do know that the British are now reducing military obligations and military strength around the world. I very much doubt that they are currently willing to consider expanding their obligations." He said that North Africa was greatly holding France back. "Neither of them (Britain and France) has the kind of capability that we possess." The U.S. Sixth Fleet stationed in the Mediterranean is a strategic reserve force that can be used when needed.

Dulles also said that the United States would not "go it alone." He said that in the event of an incident, it would act together with other countries participating in U.S. treaties.

In the previous joint sessions of the two Senate committees attended by Dulles, questioning was constant, and fierce arguments occurred from time to time.

The news said that Dulles' remarks about the British and French armies that day immediately provoked strong reactions from British and French reporters, so much so that he had to issue a statement that same evening through State Department Press Officer White, saying that he had "no intention of insulting" British and French soldiers.

    杜勒斯向参议员表示
    美国在中东要撇开英法
    并把英法军队奚落了一顿
    据新华社26日电　华盛顿消息：国务卿杜勒斯25日第四次到参议院外交和军事两个委员会的联席会议上就“艾森豪威尔主义”作证，他继续受到参议员们的质询。
    民主党参议员莫尔斯在整个上午会议上差不多一直在向杜勒斯提出一连串的问题。他要求保证美国不在中东“单独干”，应当设法将来同英法一道采取军事行动。
    他主张规定总统在派遣部队到中东去以前，要向国会获得特别的权力。他说，应当使得“不可能有”利用目前的主义来“发动一次预防性的战事”的危险。
    杜勒斯在回答中表示美国在中东政策上不准备同英法联合行动。他说，由于英法士兵在中东所受到的接待，“如果我是一个像你们所说的美国男儿，到了中东去作战，我宁愿左右没有法国兵和英国兵，这样我想我会觉得安全得多。”
    杜勒斯说，如果要求英国和法国参加美国的新政策，他不知道它们会采取什么态度。他说：“我的确知道，英国人现在正在全世界削减军事义务和军事力量。我非常怀疑目前他们是不是愿意考虑扩大它们的义务。”他说，北非把法国大大地牵制住。“它们（英法）都没有我们所拥有的那种能力。”驻在地中海的美国第六舰队是一种战略上的后备部队，在需要的时候，就可以使用它。
    杜勒斯同时又说，美国不会“单独干”。他说，万一发生事件时，它将与参加美国的各项条约的其他国家一起行动。
    在杜勒斯出席作证的历次参议院两个委员会联席会议上，一直是质问不停，并且不时发生激烈的争吵。
    消息说，杜勒斯在这天讲的关于英法军队的一番话立即引起了英法记者的强烈反应，以致他不得不在当天晚上又通过国务院新闻发布官怀特发表一个声明，说他“无意侮辱”英法军人。
