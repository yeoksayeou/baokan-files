    Several Questions Concerning Chinese Materialist Thought
    Zhang Dainian
    In recent years, in the process of teaching and researching Chinese philosophy history, and in the work of using Marxist-Leninist viewpoints and methods to organize the Chinese philosophical heritage, we have encountered some problems that are not easy to solve. These problems have been roughly mentioned in the articles "Some Problems We Encountered in the Study of Chinese Philosophy History" written by Comrade Zhu Bokun and "Two Questions on the Study of Chinese Philosophy History" written by Mr. Feng Youlan. Now, I would like to put forward some preliminary personal opinions on three questions concerning Chinese materialist thought. First, in the process of mutual struggle between materialism and idealism, do they also interact and influence each other? Second, are there also materialist elements in past historical and ethical theories? Third, to which basic form of materialism does Chinese feudal-era materialist philosophy belong?
    (I) Is the development of Chinese philosophy a process of mutual struggle between materialism and idealism? I think that, based on the analysis and research of actual materials, it should be affirmed that the history of Chinese philosophy is a history of mutual struggle between materialism and idealism. Neither "materialism" nor "idealism" is an old Chinese term. But the problem lies not in the name, but in the substance of the thought. After the Song Dynasty, there was a term with the same meaning as "idealism," which is "Xinxue" (the study of the mind). However, the doctrine opposed to Xinxue has never had a consistent and clear name. If we try to use inherent Chinese terms, we can say that the materialism of the pre-Qin and Han dynasties should be called "Naturalism." From Laozi, Zhuangzi, Xunzi, to Huan Tan, Wang Chong, and Zhongchang Tong, there is a consistent viewpoint, which is "nature," believing that the process of world development is natural and spontaneous, without a supernatural master. Materialist thought from the Wei and Jin Dynasties to the Ming and Qing Dynasties can be called "Oneness of Being" or "Theory of Qi." Pei Wei and Guo Xiang of the Western Jin Dynasty proposed the viewpoint of "revering Being." Liu Yuxi of the Tang Dynasty also affirmed "Being." Zhang Zai of the Song Dynasty, Wang Tingxiang, Wang Fuzhi, and Dai Zhen of the Ming and Qing Dynasties all took "Being" or "Qi" as the basic concept, believing that "Being" is the only entity, and Qi is the root of all things in the world. What they called "Being" is material existence, and what they called "Qi" is the original matter. Therefore, there is a materialist tradition in Chinese philosophy, which should be acknowledged.
    In history, materialism and idealism criticize and attack each other, but on the other hand, they also influence and permeate each other. If they do not influence each other, then the so-called struggle would be difficult to understand. In the process of struggle between materialism and idealism in Chinese history, there are two significant phenomena worth noting. The first point is that the victory of materialism often causes idealism to change its form; and the emergence of new forms of idealism poses new questions to materialism. This is the interaction between the two. The second point is that materialism and idealism often interpenetrate and shift in the process of development.
    Let's give a few examples to illustrate. The idealism of the Wei and Jin Dynasties is very different from the idealism of the Han Dynasty. The idealism of the Han Dynasty took the form of teleology, advocating the interaction between heaven and man; the idealism of the Wei and Jin Dynasties only talked about "non-being" that transcends the actual world, taking "non-being" as the transcendent power that creates the world, thereby denying the fundamental nature of "being." One of the reasons for this transformation is that Wang Chong destroyed the foundation of the concept of interaction between heaven and man, forcing idealism to change its form. In the Northern Song Dynasty, the idealist system of Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi was obviously influenced by Zhang Zai's theory of Qi. These examples illustrate the influence of materialism on idealism.
    Secondly, the Buddhist idea of reincarnation of life and death made the issue of "form and spirit" (body and spirit) prominent, so Fan Zhen put forward his "Theory of the Annihilation of the Spirit." The objective idealist doctrine of the Cheng-Zhu school made the issue of "Li and Qi" (principle and matter) prominent, so Wang Tingxiang put forward the doctrine of "Li residing in Qi," and Wang Fuzhi put forward the theory of "the world is only vessels." The subjective idealist doctrine of the Lu-Wang school made the issue of "mind and matter" prominent, so Wang Fuzhi put forward an analysis of the relationship between "ability and possession" (subject and object). In this way, idealism also stimulated the development of materialism.
    Thirdly, in the philosophical development from the Northern Song Dynasty to the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties, there were two important transformations. One was from Zhou Dunyi and Zhang Zai to the Cheng brothers, which was a transition from materialism to idealism. The other was from the prevalence of Xinxue in the late Ming Dynasty to the rise of materialism in the early Qing Dynasty, which was a transition from idealism to materialism. In both of these transformations, there were instances of mutual penetration between materialism and idealism.
    Zhou Dunyi's materialism was originally quite obscure, and there were many idealist components in his system, such as his so-called "sincerity," which is an idealist concept. Zhang Zai's materialism is relatively clear, but it still contains idealist elements, such as his acknowledgment of a kind of "virtuous knowledge" that is detached from perceptual knowledge. The idealism of Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi is closely related to the idealist components in the philosophy of Zhou and Zhang. In this way, not only does materialism influence idealism, but the idealist elements in materialist philosophy also trigger idealism.
    In the late Ming Dynasty, the Lu-Wang school of Xinxue launched a fierce attack on the Cheng-Zhu school of Li Xue. When the Xinxue scholars attacked Cheng-Zhu, they also adopted some arguments used by materialists at that time to oppose Cheng-Zhu. Regarding the relationship between Li and Qi, they emphasized the view that "Li is in Qi" and criticized Cheng-Zhu's assertion that "Li precedes Qi." However, they believed that Li is in Qi, and Qi is in the heart, and ultimately asserted that the heart is the first. For example, Liu Zongzhou, a thinker in the late Ming Dynasty, believed that "Li is the Li of Qi, and is definitely not before Qi or outside of Qi." But in the final analysis, he believed that the heart is the most fundamental, "connecting heaven, earth, and all things as one heart." So it is still subjective idealism. However, the rebuttals of these Xinxue scholars against Cheng-Zhu Li Xue objectively contributed to the development of materialism. Therefore, the climax of materialism in the Ming and Qing Dynasties was, on the one hand, a struggle against subjective idealism, and on the other hand, it was also positively influenced by subjective idealist elements.
    Therefore, in history, the relationship between materialism and idealism is indeed complex and intricate; it is precisely because the relationship between the two is complex and intricate that it constitutes the rich and colorful content of the entire history of philosophy.
    (II) Is China's traditional materialist thought limited to the scope of cosmology and epistemology? Are there also seeds of materialism in historical and ethical theories? This is also a problem that must be solved. Mr. Feng Youlan has already explained this very clearly in his article, and I will add a simple supplement here.
    It must be admitted that before the emergence of Marxism, neither in the East nor the West, there was scientific historical materialism. This is not a problem. However, if we believe that all past historical and ethical theories are completely idealist, then some facts are not easy to explain. In addition to Han Fei taking population growth as the cause of historical change, the book Guanzi once put forward the proposition "When the granary is full, people know etiquette; when food and clothing are sufficient, people know honor and shame." Wang Chong even reached the conclusion that "the practice of rituals and righteousness depends on sufficient grain." These ideas believe that the situation of means of subsistence is the main reason determining the moral behavior of people. This seems to be explaining people's spiritual life from their material life. We should acknowledge that, in historical and ethical theories, all thoughts that affirm material life as the basis of spiritual life have materialist significance.
    Many philosophers in the past have discussed the relationship between material life and spiritual life. An important issue in Chinese ethical theory is the issue of "Yi and Li." The so-called Yi is moral principles or ideals, and the so-called Li is material interests. Mencius, Dong Zhongshu, Cheng-Zhu, and Lu-Wang all insisted on "the distinction between Yi and Li," that is, "rectifying one's righteousness without seeking one's own interests, clarifying one's principles without considering one's own merits." This is to regard spiritual life as primary. This should be said to be an idealist point of view. On the other hand, Mozi combined Yi and Li, believing that Yi is the great benefit of the country and the people. Zhang Zai regarded the public interest of the world as Yi, and Ye Shi and Yan Yuan also believed that morality cannot be separated from utility. This seems to be a materialist point of view. Can the debate on the issue of Yi and Li be said to be the struggle between materialism and idealism in the realm of ethics? I think the answer should be affirmative.
    From the actual materials, we should admit that there are seeds of materialism in past historical and ethical theories. However, it should also be admitted that there is still a big difference between materialism in cosmology and epistemology and materialism in historical and ethical theories. Within the former scope, materialist thought has long formed a system; while within the latter scope, materialist concepts are inevitably fragmented and unsystematic, and are often mixed with idealist concepts. This should still be estimated separately.
    (III) Now let's talk about the basic form of Chinese materialism.
    According to the general statement now, in the history of Western philosophy, the main three basic forms of materialism before the emergence of Marxism are: the first is ancient naive materialism, the second is metaphysical materialism in the 17th and 18th centuries, and the third is the materialism of Russian revolutionary democrats.
    What is the situation in Chinese philosophy? The materialism of the pre-Qin Dynasty is naive materialism, which is not a problem. But to which basic form does the materialism after the Han and Wei Dynasties, especially the materialism after the Song Dynasty, belong? Obviously, it does not belong to the second or third. It is neither based on fairly developed mechanics, that is, it is not metaphysical, nor is it anti-serfdom.
    Can we simply say that the materialism of the Han, Jin, Song, and Ming Dynasties is all ancient naive materialism?
    We might as well separate the two adjectives "ancient" and "naive." If we say that the materialism of the Song Dynasty and the Ming and Qing Dynasties are not products of capitalist society, and therefore belong to the scope of "ancient" materialism, this seems acceptable. But this statement is too simplistic, and the meaning of so-called "ancient" materialism is too broad, and therefore too vague.
    If we say that the materialism of the Song Dynasty and the Ming and Qing Dynasties is all so-called "naive" materialism, then there are even more problems. We must first look at what the so-called naive means. When we say that a certain philosophy is naive, we mean that it is simple, it does not have precise scientific knowledge as its basis, and it is not established on the basis of a conscious criticism of opposing ideas. The last point should be the most important. So-called naive materialism means that it is not based on a criticism of idealist philosophy. It may be against primitive religious concepts, but it has not yet conducted a deep analysis of idealist philosophy. This means that naive materialism spontaneously reaches the basic propositions of materialism, rather than obtaining the main conclusions of materialism after analyzing and criticizing idealism.
    Obviously, the materialism of the Song Dynasty and the Ming and Qing Dynasties is not simple, not spontaneous, but starts from an analysis and criticism of idealism. Zhang Zai's materialism started from criticizing Buddhism; Wang Tingxiang's materialism started from refuting the objective idealism of the Cheng-Zhu school; Wang Fuzhi's materialism is based on the criticism of Cheng-Zhu-Lu-Wang idealism; Dai Zhen's thought is particularly critical. The materialist philosophy of the Song, Ming, and Qing Dynasties is combative, critical, and established by defeating idealism.
    In fact, not only is the materialism of the Song, Ming, and Qing Dynasties like this, but also the materialism of the Han, Jin, and Southern and Northern Dynasties. Wang Chong's philosophy is based on a criticism of idealist teleology, Pei Wei's "Reverence for Being" consciously refutes the idealism of Wang Bi and Wang Yan; Fan Zhen is a fearless fighter against Buddhism, and his "Theory of the Annihilation of the Spirit" has a clear critical nature.
    Given this, to which basic form should these materialist philosophies belong?
    This question is very complicated and needs to be discussed at length. But here, I might as well put forward my preliminary personal opinion. I think that the materialism after the Han and Jin Dynasties, especially the materialism of the Song Dynasty and the Ming and Qing Dynasties, should not be simply regarded as naive materialism, but can be called the materialism of progressive scholars in the feudal era.
    This type of materialism has three characteristics. First, it starts from criticizing idealism and has a clear critical nature. Second, it is based on the scientific knowledge of the time, and most materialists are also scientists. Third, it more or less contains dialectical thought and has a fairly close connection with dialectical viewpoints. Many materialists, especially Zhang Zai and Wang Fuzhi, have a relatively deep understanding of objective dialectical laws. From the first point of view, this type of materialism is very different from naive materialism. From the third point of view, this type of materialism is very different from metaphysical materialism. Therefore, it should be acknowledged that this is a unique type of materialism.
    Obviously, the feudal era in Chinese history has important differences from the feudal era in Western history. In the West, religion is the ruling ideology of the feudal era, and it is an ideology with absolute authority. In the Western Middle Ages, the religious atmosphere enveloped everything, so materialism suffered serious setbacks and seemed to be on the verge of extinction. But the situation in China is far from this. Buddhism occupied a dominant position for a period of time, but it did not have absolute authority. Therefore, materialism has been developing and growing. And precisely because idealism is ultimately the dominant ideology, the materialism of the Chinese feudal era has taken on a critical color, and it is consciously fighting against idealism.
    In the feudal era in Chinese history, materialism did not decline, but had rich achievements (of course, it also had its serious shortcomings), which is also a characteristic of the history of Chinese philosophy.
    The problems mentioned above still need further analysis and research. Here, I am just writing out some personal feelings. I believe that through the debate of different opinions, a more satisfactory conclusion will be reached on these issues.

    关于中国唯物主义思想的几个问题
    张岱年
    近几年来，在中国哲学史的教学与研究的过程中，在运用马克思列宁主义的观点方法来整理中国哲学遗产的工作中，我们感到有一些不易解决的问题。这些问题，在朱伯昆同志所写的“我们在中国哲学史研究中所遇到的一些问题”及冯友兰先生所写的“关于中国哲学史研究的两个问题”两篇文章中，已经大致提到了。现在仅就关于中国唯物主义思想的三个问题，提出个人的一些初步意见。第一，唯物主义与唯心主义在相互斗争的过程中是否也相互作用相互影响呢？第二，在过去的历史观与伦理学说中是否也有唯物主义的因素呢？第三，中国封建时代的唯物主义哲学属于唯物主义的哪一个基本形式呢？
    （一）中国哲学发展的过程是不是唯物主义与唯心主义相互斗争的过程？我想，根据实际材料的分析研究，应该肯定中国哲学史是唯物主义与唯心主义相互斗争的历史。“唯物主义”与“唯心主义”都不是中国旧有的名词。但问题不在名词上，而在思想的实质上。在宋代以后有一个与“唯心主义”意义相同的名词，就是“心学”。但与心学对立的学说却始终没有一个一贯的鲜明的名称。假如试用中国固有的名词，可以说，先秦与汉代的唯物主义应该叫作“自然论”，从老子、庄子、荀子、到桓谭、王充、仲长统，有一个一贯的观点，就是“自然”，认为世界发展的过程是自然而然的，没有超自然的主宰。魏晋以后，直到明清时代的唯物主义思想，可以叫作“唯有论”或“唯气论”。西晋的裴頠、郭象提出“崇有”的观点，唐代的刘禹锡也肯定了“有”，宋代的张载，明清时代的王廷相、王夫之、戴震，都以“有”或“气”为基本观念，认为“有”是唯一的实体，气是世界万物的根本。他们所谓“有”就是物质存在，所谓“气”就是原始物质。所以中国哲学中有一个唯物主义的传统，这是应该承认的。
    在历史上，唯物主义与唯心主义是相互批评相互攻击的，但在另一方面却也相互影响相互渗透。假如不相互影响，那末所谓斗争，也就难于理解了。在中国历史上，唯物主义与唯心主义的斗争的过程中，有两点显著的现象值得注意的。第一点是，唯物主义的胜利往往使唯心主义改变形态；而唯心主义的新形态的出现又对唯物主义提出了新的问题。这就是两者的相互作用。第二点是，唯物主义与唯心主义在发展过程中更往往有交相渗透交相推移的情况。
    举几个例子来说明。魏晋时代的唯心主义与汉代的唯心主义有很大的不同。汉代唯心主义采取了目的主义的形态，宣扬天人感应；魏晋时代的唯心主义却只讲超越实际世界的“无”，以“无”为创造世界的超然的力量，从而否认“有”的根本性。这一转变的原因之一就是王充摧毁了天人感应观念的基础，使得唯心主义不得不改变形态了。在北宋时代，程颢、程颐的唯心主义体系曾经受到张载关于气的学说的影响，更是显而易见的。这些例子说明了唯物主义对于唯心主义的影响。
    其次，佛教的生死轮回的思想使“形神” （身体与精神）的问题突出起来，所以范缜才提出他的“神灭论”。程朱学派的客观唯心主义学说使“理气”（规律与物质）的问题突出起来，所以王廷相提出了“理载于气”的学说，王夫之提出了“天下惟器”的理论。陆王学派的主观唯心主义学说使“心物”问题突出起来，所以王夫之才提出了关于“能所”（主体与客体）关系的分析。这样，唯心主义也刺激了唯物主义的发展。
    其次，从北宋到明清之际的哲学发展中，有两次重要的转变。一次是从周敦颐与张载到二程，这是从唯物主义到唯心主义的转折。又一次是从晚明心学的盛行到清初唯物主义的高涨，这是从唯心主义到唯物主义的转折。在这两次转变过程中都有唯物主义与唯心主义交互渗透的情形。
    周敦颐的唯物主义本来是相当隐晦的，他的体系中有很多的唯心主义成分，例如他所谓“诚”就是唯心主义的观念。张载的唯物主义比较鲜明，但仍然含有唯心主义的因素，例如他承认有一种脱离感性认识的“德性所知”。程颢程颐的唯心主义是和周张哲学中唯心主义成分有密切关系的。这样，不但唯物主义影响唯心主义，而且，唯物主义哲学中的唯心主义因素也引发了唯心主义。
    在明代后期，陆王心学对于程朱理学展开了猛烈的攻击。在心学家攻击程朱的时候，也采用了当时唯物主义者反对程朱的一些论据。关于理气关系问题，他们强调了“理在气中”的见解，批判了程朱“理在气先”的主张。不过他们以为理在气中，气又在心中，最后还是断言心是第一。例如明末思想家刘宗周认为“理即是气之理，断然不在气先，不在气之外”。但归根到底认为心是最根本的，“通天地万物为一心”。所以依然是主观唯心主义。但这些心学家们对于程朱理学的反驳，在客观上颇有助于唯物主义的发展。因此，明清之际唯物主义的高潮，一方面固然是反对主观唯心主义的搏斗，而另一方面却也受到主观唯心主义因素的积极的影响。
    所以，在历史上，唯物主义与唯心主义二者之间的关系实在是错综复杂的；惟其二者的关系是错综复杂的，所以才构成全部哲学史的丰富多采的内容。
    （二）中国的传统的唯物主义思想是否限于宇宙观与认识论的范围以内呢？在历史观与伦理学说中是否也有唯物主义的萌芽？这也是一个必须解决的问题。关于这个问题，冯友兰先生的文章中已经讲得很清楚，这里再作一点简单的补充。
    必须承认，在马克思主义出现以前，无论中西，都没有科学的历史唯物主义，这是没有问题的。不过，假如认为过去的一切历史观与伦理学说都完全是唯心主义的，那就有一些事实不容易解释了。除了韩非以人口的增长为历史变动的原因以外，管子书中曾经提出“仓廪实则知礼节；衣食足则知荣辱”的命题，王充更达到了“礼义之行在于谷足”的结论。这些思想以为生活资料的情况是决定人们的道德行为的情况的主要原因。这似乎可以说是从人们的物质生活来解释人们的精神生活。我们似乎应该承认，在历史观与伦理学说中，凡肯定物质生活为精神生活之基础的思想，都有唯物主义的意义。
    过去有许多哲学家讨论到物质生活与精神生活的关系的问题。中国伦理学说中有一个重要问题是“义利”问题。所谓义就是道德原则或理想，所谓利就是物质利益。孟子、董仲舒以及程朱、陆王，都坚持“义利之辨”，即所谓“正其义不谋其利，明其道不计其功”。这就是把精神生活看作首要的。这应该说是唯心主义的观点。另一方面，墨子把义利结合起来，以为义就是国家人民之大利。张载以天下之公利为义，叶适、颜元也都认为道义不能脱离功利。这似乎可以说是唯物主义的观点。关于义利问题的争论是否可以说是伦理学范围内的唯物主义与唯心主义的斗争呢？我想应该作肯定的回答。
    从实际材料来看，我们应该承认，在过去的历史观与伦理学说中也有唯物主义的萌芽。但是，也应该承认，在宇宙观认识论方面的唯物主义，与在历史观伦理学说方面的唯物主义，情况还是有很大的不同。在前者的范围内，唯物主义的思想久已形成为体系了；而在后者的范围内，唯物主义的观念不免是片断的不成体系的，而且往往与唯心主义观念夹杂在一起。这还是应该分别予以估计的。
    （三）现在谈到中国唯物主义的基本形式的问题。
    照现在一般的说法，在西方哲学史上，马克思主义出现以前的唯物主义主要有三个基本形式：第一个是古代的朴素的唯物主义，第二个是十七、八世纪形而上学的唯物主义，第三个是俄国革命民主主义者的唯物主义。
    中国哲学中的情况如何呢？先秦的唯物主义是朴素的唯物主义，这没有问题。但是，汉魏以后的，尤其是宋代以后的唯物主义属于那一基本形式呢？显然，它不属于第二或者第三。它既不是以相当发达的力学为基础，即不是形而上学的，也不是反农奴制度的。
    是否可以简单地说，汉、晋、宋、明的唯物主义都是古代的朴素的唯物主义呢？
    不妨把“古代的”与“朴素的”两个形容词分开来。假如说，宋代以及明清的唯物主义都不是资本主义社会的东西，因而都属于“古代”的唯物主义的范围，这似乎也可以说得过去。但是这个说法未免太简单化了，所谓“古代”唯物主义的意义未免太广泛，因而也就太漠忽了。
    假如说，宋代及明清的唯物主义都是所谓“朴素的”唯物主义，那就更有问题了。我们先要看一看所谓朴素是什么意义。我们说某种哲学是朴素的，就是说，它是简单的，它没有精密的科学知识作为根据，它并不是建立在那对于敌对思想之自觉的批判之基础上的。最后一点应该是最重要的。所以叫作朴素的唯物主义，就是说它并不是以对于唯心主义哲学之批判为根据的。它可以是反对原始宗教观念的，但对于唯心主义哲学还没有进行深刻的分析。这也就是说，朴素的唯物主义是自发地达到唯物主义的基本命题，而不是经过对于唯心主义的分析批判然后得到唯物主义的主要结论。
    显然，宋代与明清的唯物主义并不是简单的，并不是自发的，而是以对于唯心主义的分析批判为出发点的。张载的唯物主义从批判佛教开始；王廷相的唯物主义从反驳程朱学派的客观唯心主义出发；王夫之的唯物主义更是以对于程朱陆王唯心主义的批判为基石；戴震思想的批判性尤为显著。宋明清的唯物主义哲学是战斗性的，是批判性的，是战胜了唯心主义而建立起来的。
    事实上不仅宋明清的唯物主义是如此，而且汉晋南北朝时代的唯物主义也是如此。王充的哲学建立在对于唯心主义目的主义之批判上，裴頠的崇有论更是有意识地反驳了王弼、王衍的唯心主义；范缜是反佛教的无畏斗士，他的神灭论具有鲜明的批判性。
    既然如此，这些唯物主义哲学应该属于哪一基本形式呢？
    这个问题是很复杂的，需要从长讨论。但在这里也不妨提出个人的初步意见。我认为，汉晋以后的唯物主义，尤其是宋代与明清的唯物主义，不应该简单地算作朴素唯物主义，而可以称之为封建时代的进步学者的唯物主义。
    这一类型的唯物主义有三个特点。第一，它是从批判唯心主义出发的，具有鲜明的批判性质。第二，它是以当时的科学知识为基础的，多数唯物主义者都同时是科学家。第三，它或多或少地包含辩证思想，与辩证观点有相当密切的联系。许多唯物主义者，特别是张载与王夫之，对于客观辩证规律有较为深刻的认识。从第一点来讲，这类唯物主义与朴素的唯物主义大不相同。从第三点来讲，这类唯物主义又与形而上的唯物主义大不相同。因而，应该承认，这是自成一类的唯物主义。
    显然，中国历史上的封建时代与西洋历史上的封建时代有重要的区别。在西方，宗教是封建时代的统治思想，而且是有绝对威权的统治思想。在西方中世纪，宗教气氛笼罩了一切，因而唯物主义遭受了严重的挫折，似乎可以说不绝如缕。但中国的情况远非如此。佛教在一个时期占了统治地位，但也没有绝对的威权。因而，唯物主义一直在发展、在成长。而正因为唯心主义究竟是占统治地位的思想，所以中国封建时代的唯物主义就带上了批判的彩色，它是自觉地进行对于唯心主义的战斗的。
    中国历史上的封建时代中，唯物主义没有衰落，反而有丰富的成就（当然也有其严重的缺点），这也是中国哲学史的一个特点。
    以上所谈到的问题都还需要作进一步的分析研究，这里不过是写出个人的一些感想而已。我相信，经过不同的意见的争论，对于这些问题，是会得到比较满意的结论的。
