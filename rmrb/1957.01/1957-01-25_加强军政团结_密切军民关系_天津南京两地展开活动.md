(Our report) According to the Tianjin Daily: On January 23rd, the Political Department of the Tianjin Garrison District of the People's Liberation Army organized six discipline inspection teams, which went to various units in the city, including government agencies, organizations, enterprises, transportation departments, districts, streets, and public entertainment venues, to solicit opinions in order to better strengthen military-government and military-civilian relations.

In recent days, all units under the Tianjin Garrison District of the People's Liberation Army have successively conducted education among officers and soldiers on supporting the government and cherishing the people, exemplarily abiding by government policies and laws, and strengthening military-government unity and close military-civilian relations, in order to promote the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army sharing weal and woe with the people.

In order to strengthen military-civilian relations, the stationed troops in Tianjin will also organize zonal get-togethers with local departments during the Spring Festival. The cultural troupe under the Political Department of the Tianjin Garrison District is rushing to rehearse programs, preparing to start慰问 performances in various districts from the 29th. The film team of this political department has also made plans to perform for government agencies, citizens, families of martyrs, and military dependents during the Spring Festival.

The Political Department of the Tianjin Municipal General Team of the Public Security Forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently invited representatives from some municipal-level agencies, organizations, and the Hexi District Party and government agencies that have more contact with the Public Security Forces to hold a symposium on supporting the government and cherishing the people, and proactively solicited criticisms and opinions from people of all walks of life on the troops. The symposium was conducted in a very cordial and warm atmosphere. In their speeches, in addition to repeatedly expressing their gratitude to the troops and requesting that the respect of people from all walks of life in Tianjin be conveyed, the representatives also put forward some criticisms and suggestions on the mistakes and shortcomings of individual personnel in the troops.

Lieutenant Colonel Zhao Fujian, Director of the Political Department of the General Team, accepted the opinions and criticisms raised by everyone on behalf of the General Team.

(Our report) According to the Xinhua Daily: The Spring Festival activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers in Nanjing have gradually begun.

Baixia, Qinhuai and other districts have begun to carry out publicity activities among the people to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers during the Spring Festival. The street offices in Jianye District will organize inspection teams for supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers, through holding seminars or door-to-door visits, to understand the production and living conditions of families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers, and help them solve difficulties.

Baixia, Jianye, Gulou and other districts have held seminars with the stationed troops in their jurisdictions. The responsible comrades of each district introduced the situation of the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers to the representatives of the stationed troops, soliciting the opinions of the troops, and studying and solving problems in military-civilian and military-government relations. Each district is also preparing to hold military-civilian joint celebrations and representative meetings or seminars of families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers before and after the Spring Festival to convey and implement the spirit of the National Congress of Active Elements in Socialist Construction of Families of Martyrs, Military Dependents, Disabled Soldiers, and Demobilized Soldiers.
