Xinhua News Agency, 30th: The Civil Aviation Administration of China has decided to open eight new air routes successively starting from January 1957.

    The eight new air routes are: Beijing—Baotou—Lanzhou—Xining—Taldin; Beijing—Baotou—Xining—Yushu—Lhasa; Beijing—Taiyuan—Xi'an—Chengdu; Beijing—Xuzhou—Hefei—Shanghai; Beijing—Wuhan—Nanning; Beijing—Baotou—Jiuquan—Urumqi; Shanghai—Hangzhou—Nanchang—Guangzhou; Shanghai—Nanjing—Wuhan—Xi'an—Lanzhou. Among these, except for the Beijing—Lhasa route which will have irregular flights, the other new routes will have one to four flights per week.

    The total length of these newly opened air routes is 16,015 kilometers. The opening of the new routes will facilitate transportation between our capital and remote areas, and also make it faster and more convenient for coastal industrial cities to support the economic and cultural construction of the interior.
    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 30th: A new air route from Urumqi via Jiuquan and Baotou to Beijing has been successfully test-flown. The test flight plane departing from Urumqi arrived in Beijing at 4:00 PM today after eight and a half hours of flight time.

    This new air route is more than 2,600 kilometers long, which is about 500 kilometers shorter than the original route via Lanzhou, Xi'an, and other places; the original two-day journey can now be completed on the same day. Only during the period of extremely short daylight hours in winter, because Urumqi dawns two hours later than Beijing, and Beijing gets dark two hours earlier than Urumqi, the plane departing from Urumqi needs to stay overnight in Jiuquan and arrive in Beijing on the second day.

    Over 1,000 kilometers from Jiuquan to Baotou, most of the area is undulating desert. During the opening of this section of the route, the test flight plane maintained an altitude of 3,000 meters and flew very smoothly.

    According to the person in charge of the test flight, the test flight results were good, and the new air route can be officially opened in early January.

    八条新航空线将陆续通航
    新华社30日讯　中国民用航空局决定从1957年1月起陆续开辟八条新的航空线。
    这八条新航线是：北京—包头—兰州—西宁—塔尔丁；北京—包头—西宁—玉树—拉萨；北京—太原—西安—成都；北京—徐州—合肥—上海；北京—武汉—南宁；北京—包头—酒泉—乌鲁木齐；上海—杭州—南昌—广州；上海—南京—武汉—西安—兰州。其中除了北京—拉萨航线是不定期飞行以外，其他新航线每星期有一至四次的班机往来。
    这些新辟航线的长度共有一万六千零一十五公里。新线的开辟将便于我国首都同边远地区之间的交通运输，也使沿海工业城市支援内地经济、文化建设更为迅速便利。
    新华社乌鲁木齐30日电　从乌鲁木齐途经酒泉、包头到北京的一条新航线试航成功。从乌鲁木齐飞出的试航飞机经过八个半小时的飞行时间，在今天下午四时到达北京。
    这条新航线全长二千六百多公里，比原来经过兰州、西安等地的航线航程缩短了约五百公里；原来需要两天的航程，现在当天就可以到达。仅仅在冬季白昼特短时期，由于乌鲁木齐比北京天明迟两小时，而北京又比乌鲁木齐天黑早两小时，从乌鲁木齐起飞的飞机，才需要在酒泉住宿，在第二天到达北京。
    这条新航线从酒泉到包头的一千多公里，大部分地区是起伏的沙漠，试航飞机在开辟这段航线的时候，一直保持三千公尺的高度，飞得很平稳。
    据试航负责人说，这次试航结果良好，新航线在1月初就可以正式通航。
