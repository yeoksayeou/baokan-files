    "Self-Built with Public Assistance" Workers' New Village
    Xiao Han
    Last year, four workers' new villages appeared on the banks of the Taohe River in Yangquan City, Shanxi Province. The practical, sturdy, and also quite beautiful bungalows were built layer upon layer along the mountain shape from the banks of the Taohe River, resembling towering multi-story buildings from afar. This is where more than two thousand workers of the Yangquan Mining Bureau and their families live.
    This dormitory area of over 40,000 square meters was built by the workers themselves with money, with the help of the state.
    One snowy morning in winter, we arrived at the self-built and publicly assisted new villages of the Second and Fourth Mines. Family members were busy sweeping snow. After climbing a small earthen slope, we stopped in front of the third row of houses. The roof was shiny and bright, made of ash residue commonly used by local people, and the walls were made of bricks and large stones. White grout lines stood out on the red and blue exterior walls.
    We visited the home of worker Chen Guoliang. The suite of rooms, one large and one small, had a bedroom inside. A large mirror hung on the white walls, along with several landscape paintings, arranged very elegantly. Chen Guoliang is from Sichuan and transferred from the army in early 1955. He is now a worker at the Fourth Mine and has been married for just two months. He said that it cost more than 400 yuan to build these two rooms, and if he had built a single room, it would have only cost 240 yuan.
    Wang Shouxin of the "Self-Built with Public Assistance" group said: "The situation is similar for each family. Transferred soldiers used the money they brought from the transfer to repair their houses first, old workers had some savings, and new workers who repaired their houses also lived frugally. In short, workers who paid for or borrowed money to repair their houses did not request subsidies due to financial difficulties. The housing loans for 1955 were all repaid within a ten-month period. The repayment period for housing loans in 1956 was extended to four years, and many workers planned to repay them early."
    Speaking of the "self-built with public assistance" house construction, there is a story. In the past, a rhyme was popular in the Yangquan Mining Bureau:
    The new coal mine is good,
    No need for picks to work,
    No need to run to work,
    No fear of the sky falling,
    No fear of fire.
    Work here for a lifetime,
    And let the children and grandchildren take over.
    There is a flaw in the beauty,
    Which is that there are too few houses.
    The so-called no fear of the sky falling refers to the great reduction in roof collapse accidents. The so-called no fear of fire refers to the elimination of gas explosion accidents after 1952. How wonderful the labor and life of the miners are! Work for a lifetime and let the next generation take over. However, "there are too few houses."
    Were there really too few houses in the Yangquan Mining Bureau? In the past, they were indeed scarce. From the start of mining at the end of the 19th century until before liberation, in those nearly seventy years, British, Japanese imperialism and Yan Xishan only built less than 5,000 square meters of prison-like worker dormitories, and many workers slept underground. In the seven years after liberation, the Yangquan Mining Bureau built 160,000 square meters of dormitories, thirty-one times more than the dormitories built in the nearly seventy years before liberation; while the number of employees only increased by two times in the same period.
    So why are there still not enough houses? The reason is simple: the miners have all started families, they are no longer just one person, but several. The number of houses built by the state is not small, but it only solved the accommodation problem for 4,000 miners' families, and there was no way to solve the accommodation problem for 20,000 miners' families.
    To meet the needs of so many people, 350,000 square meters of dormitories need to be built, requiring a state investment of 20 million yuan, which is equivalent to the total value of the production machinery and equipment of the entire Yangquan Mining Bureau. It is obviously impossible for the state to provide so much money to build dormitories at present.
    The workers understood this difficulty and were willing to pay for their own houses. In addition to the more than 2,000 people who have built houses using the "self-built with public assistance" method in the past three years, another 2,100 people have now registered to build their own houses in 1957.
    The "self-built with public assistance" method is very good, but it requires leadership and help. At the end of 1955, the Yangquan Mining Bureau studied the situation of "self-built with public assistance" house construction and found that because it did not fully realize that the number of workers building their own houses would increase with the increase in workers' wage income and the establishment of the idea of taking the mine as their home, it did not manage this work well, which led to some problems. First, there was no unified consideration of the construction location, which wasted construction land; second, there was little assistance in terms of material supply and construction, and the quality of some houses was not high. The workers were overly tired from building their own houses, which affected normal production; third, auxiliary facilities such as water supply, electricity, roads, and toilets in the new residential areas were not properly resolved.
    In order to strengthen leadership, the Mining Bureau transferred 19 cadres from the general affairs department and established five "self-built with public assistance" groups. The workers were only responsible for paying the money, and all construction work was the responsibility of the "self-built with public assistance" groups. The "self-built with public assistance" groups selected construction locations based on urban planning and the arrangement of residential areas for mine workers, and solicited the opinions of workers and their families. Then, according to the principle of adapting to local conditions and using local materials, they carried out housing design. By grasping this work, the earthwork and material transportation costs in construction were reduced to a minimum.
    In the construction, they organized a construction team of more than 1,000 people without a single full-time cadre. The construction teams and groups were composed of members of 61 agricultural cooperatives from nearby counties, and the cooperative cadres were the team and group leaders. They assigned construction objects according to the specialties of each team and group. For example, the members who were stonemasons from Pindding, Xiyang, Jingxing and other counties were assigned to build stone houses. The "self-built with public assistance" groups also paid attention to carrying out ideological education among the members, letting them know the significance of building these houses well for consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and therefore they were particularly careful to protect materials and pay attention to engineering quality. Some members said: "How can we waste the money earned by the workers' hard work?"
    With the support of the leaders of each mine, the "self-built with public assistance" groups properly arranged the food and accommodation for the more than 1,000 farmers who were building houses for the workers; at the same time, with the consent of the workers, they also extracted 5% from the cost of the houses as medical, labor protection and reward expenses for the members, which greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the members.

### “自建公助”的工人新村

    “自建公助”的工人新村
    萧寒
    去年，在山西省阳泉市洮河河畔，出现了四座工人新村。适用、坚固、也还美观的平房，从洮河河畔顺着山形一层层地修上去，远远望去，像是矗立的多层大楼。这里，居住着阳泉矿务局两千多名工人和他们的家属。
    这一片四万多平方公尺的宿舍，是工人们自己出钱，在国家帮助下建成的。
    冬天，一个雪后的早晨，我们到了二矿和四矿工人们自建公助的新村。家属们正忙着扫雪。上了一个小土坡，在第三排房子的门前停住脚。房顶又光又亮，是用当地群众习惯用的灰渣打成的，墙壁是用砖和大石头砌成的。红色、蓝色的外墙上，突现着洁白的勾缝线条。
    我们访问了工人陈国梁的家。套间房子，一大一小，里间是寝室，粉白的墙面上挂着一面大镜子，旁边几幅山水画，陈设得很雅致。陈国梁是四川人，1955年初从部队转业，现在在四矿当工人，结婚刚两个月。他说修这两间房子用了四百多元，若是修单间的，只需二百四十元。
    “自建公助”小组的王守信说：“各家情况都差不多。转业军人把转业时带来的钱先用在修房上，老工人都有些积蓄，新工人修了房子，过日子也勤俭了。总之，自己出钱或借钱修了房子的工人，没有因为生活困难要求补助的。1955年修房贷款都按十个月限期还清了。1956年修房贷款归还期限延长为四年，不少工人计划提前还清。”
    说起“自建公助”盖房子来，还有一段过程。过去，在阳泉矿务局流行着这样一段顺口溜：
    新煤矿好又好，
    干活不用镐，
    上班不用跑，
    不怕天塌，
    不怕火烧。
    干它一辈子，
    再让儿孙来接班。
    美中有不足，
    就是房子少。
    所谓不怕天塌，指的是顶板塌落事故大大减少了。所谓不怕火烧，指的是1952年以后消灭了瓦斯爆炸事故。矿工的劳动、矿工的生活，真是多么美好啊！自己干一辈子，还要让下一代接班。然而，“就是房子少”。
    阳泉矿务局的房子少不少呢？从前确实是少的。从十九世纪末叶开矿起到解放前止，在这将近七十年内，英、日帝国主义和阎锡山，只修了不到五千平方公尺囚牢式的工人宿舍，不少工人就睡在井下。解放后的七年中，阳泉矿务局修了十六万平方公尺宿舍，比解放前近七十年所修的宿舍要多三十一倍；而同一时期职工人数只增加了两倍。
    那么为什么房子还是不够呢？原因很简单，矿工们都成家了，他们不再是一个人，而是好几个人，国家修的房子数量不少，但只解决了四千名矿工的家属住宿问题，还有两万名矿工的家属住宿问题没法解决。
    要满足这么多人的需要，就要修三十五万平方公尺宿舍，需要国家投资两千万元，相当于阳泉矿务局全局生产机械设备的总值。国家要拿这么多钱来修宿舍，在目前显然是不可能的。
    工人们了解了这种困难，都乐意自己出钱修房子。除了过去三年中先后有二千多人用“自建公助”的办法盖了房子以外，现在又有二千一百人登记在1957年自己盖房子。
    “自建公助”的办法很好，但需要领导和帮助。1955年年底，阳泉矿务局研究了一下“自建公助”盖房子的情况，发现由于没有充分认识到随着工人工资收入的增加和以矿为家的思想的确立，自建房屋的工人会越来越多，因而没有把这项工作好好地管起来，以致出了一些问题。第一、没有统一的考虑建筑位置，浪费了建筑用地；第二、材料供应和施工方面帮助很少，部分房屋质量不高，工人们自己盖房子，过分疲劳，影响正常生产；第三、新建住宅区的供水、用电、道路以及厕所等附属设备没有妥善解决。
    为了加强领导，矿务局从总务部门抽调了十九名干部，建立了五个“自建公助”小组。工人们只管出钱，全部修建工作都由“自建公助”小组负责。“自建公助”小组根据城市规划和矿区职工住宅区域的安排，征求了工人和家属们的意见，选定了建筑位置。再根据因地制宜、就地取材的原则，进行房屋设计。把这项工作抓住了，就把建筑中的土方工程和材料运输费用减少到了最低限度。
    在施工中，他们组织了一支一千多人的、没有一名脱产干部的施工队伍。施工队、组是附近各县来的六十一个农业合作社的社员组成的，社干部就是队、组长。他们根据各队、组的特长，分配建筑对象。如从平定、昔阳、井陉等县来的社员石匠多，就分配他们修石头房子。“自建公助”小组还注意在社员中进行思想教育工作，让社员们知道修好这些房子，对巩固工农联盟的意义，因而格外爱护材料和注意工程质量。有的社员说：“我们怎么能浪费工人双手劳动得来的钱呢？”
    在各矿领导的支持下，“自建公助”小组妥善安排了这一千多名替工人盖房子的农民的食宿问题；同时，征得工人的同意又从房屋造价中抽出5％，作为社员们的医疗、劳动保护和奖励费用，大大激发了社员们的劳动热情。
