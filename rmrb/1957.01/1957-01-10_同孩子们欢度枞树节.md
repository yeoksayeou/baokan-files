    Celebrating the Fir Tree Festival with Children
    By Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union, Li He
    Moscow is covered with white snow. At the foot of the snow-white Lenin Hills, the Sports Palace of the Central Stadium has been holding New Year's Fir Tree Festivals for children for days. Each of the 12,000 seats is filled. They are innocent and lively children and their relatives, many coming as families or entire schools. On the afternoon of January 8, the Chinese Government Delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai spent a joyful holiday here with Soviet children. The Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, and Deputy Prime Minister Loch, who were visiting Moscow, also participated in the event. The representatives of these two countries, located at the eastern and western ends of the socialist camp, met in Moscow and happily shared the joy of the Soviet children.
    Premier Zhou Enlai, Prime Minister Grotewohl, and others, accompanied by Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov, Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee and Secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the CPSU Furtseva, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Fedrin, and Soviet Ambassador to the People's Republic of China Yudin, entered the stands of the Sports Palace. At this moment, a burst of applause erupted in the venue, and people stood up to welcome them. Two teams of lively little girls ran up to the stands to present New Year's gifts to the guests and shook hands with them warmly.
    Then, the lights in the Sports Palace dimmed. In the spotlight of a single remaining light, the hall of the Sports Palace presented a scene of a snow-covered fairy tale land. Suddenly, a child wearing skates glided onto the stage. It turned out to be an indoor artificial skating rink, and he was blowing a Young Pioneer bugle. As soon as the bugle sounded, the lights came on. At this moment, "Grandfather Frost" with white eyebrows and a long beard led a group of Young Pioneers on a sleigh pulled by three horses around the venue. Then, they got off the sleigh and walked to the fir tree. This fir tree, eighteen meters high, is the tallest of all the New Year's fir trees in Moscow's thousands of households and many clubs and cultural palaces. "Grandfather Frost" excitedly announced to the audience in front of the fir tree: Children, do you know that the Prime Ministers of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic are celebrating the Fir Tree Festival with us? At this moment, the entire audience stood up and applauded again, and the prime ministers of the two countries and the people in the stands also stood up and applauded in response.
    Thus, "A Winter's Tale" began.
    Next, at the request of the children, "Grandfather Frost" conjured up a beautiful "Snow White" all in white from the fir tree. She first congratulated everyone on a happy new year, and then pointed the fir tree with the snow wand in her hand. The lights on the fir tree lit up, illuminating the fir tree hung with all kinds of colorful glass balls, making it as bright and brilliant as a treasure tree in a fairy tale. The excited Young Pioneers danced around the fir tree for a week.
    "Grandfather Frost" and "Snow White" were about to leave. The Young Pioneers also wanted to go with them. So who would be left to protect this human treasure tree? Some children in the venue said, leave Comrade Zhou Enlai to protect it. Later, the Young Pioneers decided to stay and protect it themselves. The kind "Grandfather Frost" and "Snow White" left.
    At this time, a hunchbacked witch drove an owl and a group of wolves onto the stage. (Of course, except for the big fir tree and the horses being real, the animals and plants in this fairy tale were all played by people.) The witch boasted that she was a kind-hearted old woman, using candy to lure the Young Pioneers. After the Young Pioneers ate her things, they all fell asleep. At this time, the witch was very happy and found the thin, tall Forest Goblin and jointly extinguished the lights of the treasure tree. They also locked the door through which "Snow White" passed when approaching the fir tree and asked the black owl to steal the key. In this way, the forces of darkness began to run rampant.
    "Snow White" returned. She skated back gracefully on the ice rink, using the snow stick to wake up the Young Pioneers. The Young Pioneers were very sad to find that the lights of the treasure tree were extinguished. They were determined to find the key and set off singing the song "Brave People". The witch and the Forest Goblin tried their best to obstruct the Young Pioneers. Several rows of small fir trees appeared on the ice rink, dancing, played by a group of child skaters. Wolves were ambushing behind this forest. The children in the audience were anxious and shouted that there were wolves behind the trees, urging the Young Pioneers not to enter the forest. This miscalculated the demons. The demons also wanted to freeze the Young Pioneers to death. A team of little boys symbolizing icicles and a team of little girls symbolizing snowflakes, all wearing pure white dance costumes, spun alternately and vigorously on the ice rink. These children were all skating experts between the ages of ten and fourteen. The demons also summoned the wind. However, the Young Pioneers relied on the raging Young Pioneer flame to overcome numerous difficulties, finally climbed into the owl's nest, and retrieved the key. All the children in the audience applauded happily. The treasure tree was re-illuminated, and a bright new year arrived with it.
    Thus ended a meaningful and fascinating fairy tale.
    Next, many figures familiar to Soviet children appeared: Chapayev, Don Quixote, the Three Russian Warriors, and so on. They circled the venue, passing in front of the stands of the Chinese and German Prime Ministers, frequently paying their respects to them.
    In addition to the Railway Workers' Cultural Troupe performing acrobatics and dance, the children also performed wonderful skating. Three eight- and nine-year-old girls performing individually were as peaceful and light as birds flying. A pair of eight- and nine-year-old boys and girls performed Russian folk dances, as skilled as if they were on stage. Several pairs of girls wearing Chinese costumes and holding fans performed fan dances. They were all students of children's and artistic skating schools, and their skillful techniques won constant applause from the Chinese and German Prime Ministers and the entire audience.
    Finally, hundreds of athletes and actors, holding the national flags of the Soviet Union and the fifteen republics, wearing national costumes, passed the stands, watching and waving to the Chinese and German Prime Ministers and representatives. At 5:00 p.m., a little girl represented all the children of Moscow in thanking the Chinese and German Prime Ministers for celebrating the festival with them. Premier Zhou and Prime Minister Grotewohl also stood up and applauded in thanks to the children, athletes, and actors.

    同孩子们欢度枞树节
    本报驻苏联记者　李何
    白雪普盖着莫斯科。在雪白的列宁山脚下，中央运动场的体育宫里，连日为儿童举行着新年枞树节。每次一万二千个座位都是坐得满满的。他们是天真活泼的儿童和儿童的亲属，许多是全家或全校来的。1月8日下午，以周恩来总理为首的中国政府代表团，在这里和苏联儿童们度过了一个欢欣的佳节。正在莫斯科访问的德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥和副总理洛赫，也参加了这个盛会。这两个位于社会主义阵营东西两端的国家的代表们，在莫斯科相逢，这时愉快地共享了苏联儿童的欢乐。
    周恩来总理、格罗提渥总理等人，在苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫、苏共中央书记兼苏共莫斯科市委书记福尔采娃、苏联外交部副部长费德林和苏联驻中华人民共和国大使尤金陪同下，进入了体育宫的看台。这时候，场内爆发了一片掌声，人们纷纷起立欢迎。两队活泼的小女孩子跑上看台去，把新年礼物献给客人们，并且同他们亲热地握手。
    接着，体育宫内灯光暗淡了。在仅留的一盏灯光的探照下，体育宫的大厅呈现出雪夜仙境的景象，突然，一个穿着冰鞋的小孩滑上场子来。原来这是室内人工滑冰场，他吹着少先队的喇叭。号声一落，灯光全明。这时，白眉长须的“严寒老人”带领一群少先队员，乘着三匹马的雪橇绕场一周，然后，下了雪橇，走到枞树跟前。这株枞树，高十八公尺，是莫斯科千家万户和许多俱乐部、文化宫所有的新年枞树中最高的一株。“严寒老人”在枞树面前向全场激动地宣布：孩子们，你们知道吗，和我们一起过枞树节的有中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国的总理们。这时，全场又一次起立鼓掌，两国总理和看台上的人们也站起来鼓掌回答。
    “冬天的故事”就这样开始了。
    接着，“严寒老人”在儿童们要求下，从枞树中招出来一位浑身雪白的漂亮的“白雪公主”。她先祝贺大家新年幸福，然后用手里的雪棒向枞树一点，枞树上的灯火齐明，把垂悬着形形色色玻璃球的枞树照得如同童话中的百宝树一样灿烂辉煌。兴高采烈的少先队员们围着枞树跳了一周。
    “严寒老人”和“白雪公主”要离开了。少先队员们也想跟他们走。那么留谁来保护这株人间宝树呢？场内有些儿童说，留下周恩来同志保护它。后来少先队员们还是决定自己留下保护它。善良的“严寒老人”和“白雪公主”离开了。
    这时，一个驼背的女魔驱着一只猫头鹰和一群狼上来。（自然，除了大枞树和马是真的以外，这个童话里的动物、植物都是人扮演的。）女魔自夸是好心肠的老婆婆，用糖果来引诱少先队员们。少先队员们吃了她的东西以后，都睡倒了，这时，女魔大乐，把瘦削的高个子林妖也找了来，合伙把宝树的灯火弄灭，并且把“白雪公主”走近枞树经过的门锁起来，叫黑猫头鹰把钥匙偷走。这样，黑暗势力开始猖獗起来。
    “白雪公主”回来了。她在冰场上飞舞地滑回来。用雪棒点醒少先队员们。少先队员们发觉宝树的灯火灭了，很难过，决心把钥匙找回来，他们唱着“勇敢的人”之歌出发了。女魔和林妖千方百计地阻挠少先队员们。在冰场上出现了几行小枞树，跳着舞，它们是一批儿童滑冰家扮演的。在这树林后面埋伏着狼群。儿童观众们着急了，他们大喊树后有狼，招呼少先队员们不要进入树林。这使妖魔失算了。妖魔又想冻死少先队员们。一队象征着冰柱的男小孩和一队象征着雪花的女小孩，都穿着纯白的舞服，在冰场上更番地、用力地旋舞。这些小孩都是十岁到十四岁的滑冰能手。妖魔还呼唤来了大风。但是，少先队员们依靠熊熊的少先火焰，战胜了重重困难，最后攀上猫头鹰窝，夺回了钥匙，全场儿童都高兴得鼓起掌来。宝树重新照亮了，充满光明的新年随着到来了。
    就这样结束了意味深长的迷人的童话。
    接着，出现了许多苏联儿童熟悉的人物；夏伯阳、唐·吉呵德、俄罗斯三勇士，等等。他们绕场一周，经过中德两国总理看台面前，向他们频频致敬。
    除了铁路工人文工团表演了杂技和舞蹈以外，儿童们还表演了精采的滑冰。三个单独表演的八、九岁的女孩子，像小鸟飞翔一样的安详轻巧。一对八、九岁的男女孩子表演了俄罗斯民间舞，娴熟得好像在舞台上一样。有几对身穿中国服装，手拿扇子的女孩子表演了扇舞。她们都是儿童和艺术滑冰学校的学生，她们的熟练的技巧博得了中德两国总理和全场观众的不断的掌声。
    最后，几百名运动员和演员举着苏联和十五个加盟共和国的国旗，穿着各民族的服装，经过看台，向中德两国总理和代表们注目、招手。到下午五时，一位小女孩代表莫斯科全市的儿童感谢中德两国总理同他们一起欢度佳节。周总理和格罗提渥总理也起立向儿童们、运动员们和演员们鼓掌答谢。
