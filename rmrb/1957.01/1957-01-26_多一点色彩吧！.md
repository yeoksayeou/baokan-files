    More Color, Please!
    Pan Jiezhi
    I've seen a lot of traditional Chinese paintings recently, and in my excitement, I'd like to talk about the use of "color" in traditional Chinese painting.
    Chinese painting has always emphasized color. "Danqing" (cinnabar and azurite) and painting were synonymous in ancient times. To illustrate the boldness of ancient painters in using color, let's take Gu Kaizhi's "Record of Painting Yuntai Mountain" as an example. In the design of this painting, he advocated adding five-colored auspicious clouds to the blue sky, painting reflections of objects in the clear water, and adding shadows to the mountains, with white tigers and brightly dressed figures interspersed among the red cliffs and purple rocks. It is a pity that this colorful picture has not been handed down, but one thing is certain: the ancient painters' use of color was by no means a simple reproduction of nature, but a bold creation in artistic contemplation, even to the point of being astonishing.
    Early examples include the Han paintings from Liaoyang and painted lacquer boxes; later examples include the murals from Dunhuang during the Northern Wei dynasty and onwards; Mr. Lu Xun praised the brilliance of the Tang dynasty Buddhist paintings, and this brilliance comes from color; today we can still witness their authenticity in the more than two hundred Tang dynasty grottoes in Dunhuang. There are also many masterpieces with bright colors in scroll paintings, such as Zhan Ziqian's "Touring in Spring" from the Sui dynasty, Gu Hongzhong's "The Night Revels of Han Xizai" from the Five Dynasties, Wang Ximeng's "A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains" from the Song dynasty, and Zhao Boju's "Autumn Colors of Rivers and Mountains," all of which are well-known. Since the rise of ink wash painting in the Yuan and Ming dynasties, Chinese painters have regarded color as optional. The lack of color in traditional Chinese painting did not begin today, but only today do we particularly feel the acuteness of the problem, because paintings lacking color are so incompatible with our rich and colorful life!
    I do not deny that ink has five colors, but ink cannot completely replace color after all; I do not deny that ink wash painting can display the national style of Chinese painting, but why can't heavy color painting do the same? Lines and brushwork are originally inseparable, and the so-called style is naturally not a problem. Today's traditional Chinese painters have made great efforts in using color, and the ancient tradition of colored painting is seeing a revival, which is very gratifying. However, some obstacles still need to be cleared, such as the idea that traditional Chinese painting can only use traditional Chinese painting pigments, that traditional Chinese painting must be based on ink and supplemented by color, that traditional Chinese painting has a fixed formula for using color, and cannot be like Western painting (including Japanese painting), etc., all of which are restricting painters from boldly using color. Some relatively brave painters have made bold attempts, but what they get is often less encouragement and support and more criticism, especially from "experts," which inevitably makes them worry.
    Painters have different feelings about life and nature, and the methods they adopt to express themselves are also different. The "let a hundred flowers bloom" in traditional Chinese painting is embodied here. The reason why I particularly raise the issue of color is to hope that more colorful flowers will appear in the garden, to meet the aesthetic requirements of the people today.
    I hope that traditional Chinese painters will not be stingy with color, will not be bound by old conventions, will not be afraid of criticism, and will let heavy color and ink wash contend! This will be of great benefit to the prosperity of traditional Chinese painting and to the correct inheritance and development of the excellent traditions of traditional Chinese painting.

    多一点色彩吧！
    潘洁兹
    近来看了不少的国画作品，兴奋之余，也来谈谈国画的用“色”。
    中国绘画从来是注重色彩的，丹青和绘画在古代是同义语。古代画家用色的大胆，不妨举出顾恺之的“画云台山记”为例。他在这幅画的设计中，主张蓝天上加五色絪缊的庆云，青水中画出景物的倒影，山有阴影，丹崖、紫石间，缀以白虎和衣服鲜丽的人物。这幅彩色斑烂的图画可惜没有流传下来，但有一点是可以肯定的，即古代画家对于色彩的运用，决非简单地复现自然，而是在艺术观照中大胆创造，甚至到了令人吃惊的地步。
    早期的如辽阳汉画、彩箧漆奁；稍后的如敦煌北魏以来的壁画；鲁迅先生盛赞唐代佛画的灿烂，灿烂由色彩而来；今天我们也尚能在敦煌二百多个唐代石窟中目睹其真。卷轴画中色彩鲜丽的杰作也很多，如隋展子虔“游春图”、五代顾闳中“韩熙载夜宴图”、宋王希孟“千里江山图”、赵伯驹“江山秋色图”等，都为大家所熟知。自元、明水墨画兴起后，中国画家便视色彩为可有可无了。国画之缺乏色彩，固不自今日始，但唯有今天，才特别感到问题之尖锐，因为缺乏色彩的绘画，同我们丰富多采的生活是多么地不相称啊！
    我不否认墨有五色，但墨到底不能完全代替色；我不否认水墨画能显示中国绘画的民族风格，但重彩画又何尝不能？线条、笔法原不分彼此，风格云云，自也不在话下。今日国画家在运用色彩上作了很大努力，古代彩绘传统行见复兴，这是大可欣慰的事。但有些障碍还待清除，如有人认为国画只能用国画颜料，国画必须以墨为主、色为辅，国画用色有定方，不能如洋画（包括日本画）等等，都在束缚着画家不敢大胆使用色彩。有些比较勇敢的画家，大胆尝试了一下，所得往往是鼓励支持的少、指责批评的多，特别出于“行家”们，这又怎能不叫他们顾虑重重呢？
    画家对生活和自然的感受各有不同，所采取表现的方法也不一样，国画的“百花齐放”正体现在这里。我之所以特别提出用色问题，乃是希望百花园中，多出现一些更为艳丽的花朵，满足今天人民的欣赏要求。
    希望国画家不要吝惜色彩，不要为陈规成法所束缚，不要害怕批评，让重彩和水墨争鸣吧！这对国画的繁荣，和国画优良传统的正确继承与发扬，都是大有好处的。
