Xinhua News Agency, January 1st: After the high tide of the socialist revolution movement in 1956, China's rural areas have basically achieved advanced forms of agricultural cooperativization, reaching the requirements stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) one year ahead of schedule.

At the end of 1955, there were not many advanced agricultural production cooperatives; however, by November 1956, the number of advanced agricultural production cooperatives nationwide had developed to more than 488,000, with an average of 206 households per cooperative, and more than 100 million households participating, accounting for approximately 83% of the total number of farm households nationwide. In this way, the long-term scattered individual small-scale farming economy in our country has been fundamentally changed, and agricultural production cooperatives of a completely socialist nature have become the main form of production in China's rural areas.

The development process of the agricultural cooperativization movement in 1956 was roughly as follows: From January to the end of March, the movement was at its peak, the scale of the movement continued to expand, and the main trend of the movement turned to advanced cooperativization. During this period, the proportion of farm households joining agricultural cooperatives rose from 63.3% to 88.9%, basically completing primary agricultural cooperativization; among them, the proportion of farm households joining advanced agricultural cooperatives rose to 54.9%, reaching more than half of the total number of farm households nationwide joining advanced cooperatives. April to the end of August was the busiest season for rural production, and the development of the cooperativization movement in various regions temporarily stopped, turning to consolidation work. However, due to new developments in Sichuan, Gansu, Hunan, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Xinjiang, Anhui, Jiangxi and other provinces and regions under generally stable conditions, the number of farm households joining agricultural cooperatives nationwide increased by about 4%, reaching 92.9%; among them, the number of farm households joining advanced agricultural cooperatives increased by 11.2%, reaching 66.1%. After September, the work of expanding cooperatives, merging cooperatives, and transforming primary cooperatives into advanced cooperatives continued to be carried out in rural areas, with faster progress in Guangdong, Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, Fujian, Hubei, Shandong and other seven provinces. According to statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics, by the end of November, there were more than 764,000 agricultural production cooperatives (including advanced cooperatives) nationwide, with more than 116.74 million households participating, accounting for 96.1% of the total number of farm households nationwide. At present, in addition to some areas that are still continuing the work of transforming primary cooperatives into advanced cooperatives, the vast majority of provinces and regions are carrying out winter rectification of agricultural cooperatives.

After more than a year of production practice and various tests, it has been fully proven that advanced forms of agricultural production cooperatives have incomparable superiority over small-scale farming economies in promoting the development of agricultural productive forces, developing diversified economies, changing farming systems, overcoming natural disasters, and resettling farmers who have lost their labor power. Its main manifestation is increased production and increased income for the majority of farmers. 1956 was a year in which China's rural areas suffered quite severe natural disasters, with flood-affected areas alone exceeding 180 million mu. However, on a national scale, all major crops still achieved an overall increase in production, with a significant increase in yield compared to the bumper year of 1955. For example, grain production increased by more than 20 billion jin compared to 1955, and cotton production increased by 1.22 million dan. Compared with the original 1957 targets of the First Five-Year Plan: grain, flue-cured tobacco, tea, and tussah silkworm cocoons exceeded the original 1957 targets; cotton was roughly on par with the original 1957 targets. On the basis of production development, the income of the majority of farmers increased compared to 1955, and their living standards improved. According to typical surveys in various regions, approximately 70% to 75% of the members of agricultural cooperatives increased their income compared to 1955, approximately 10% to 15% of the members' income remained unchanged or increased or decreased little, and approximately 10% of the members' income decreased. Without agricultural cooperativization, it would not have been possible to achieve this achievement. However, due to the short time of agricultural cooperativization, insufficient experience, severe natural disasters, and the fact that many rural workers saw more of the favorable factors brought about by the high tide of cooperativization and less of the unfavorable factors, they were overly demanding and impatient in their work, simple and crude, and lacked in-depth and meticulous ideological education and organizational work, which also brought many shortcomings and errors to the work. These complex issues need to be further resolved in future work.

In the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, the Party and the government have taken a series of effective measures and provided farmers with huge support in terms of financial and material resources. The CPC Central Committee promptly opposed the right-leaning conservative thinking in the agricultural cooperativization movement, promoted the arrival of the high tide of cooperativization; after the high tide of cooperativization arose, it promptly gave the farmers who were advancing towards socialism a long-term goal—the Twelve-Year National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), promoted a high tide of agricultural production, and promoted the unprecedented high enthusiasm of 500 million farmers and the vast number of rural cadres. In order to adapt to the production leadership, management and organizational construction of agricultural cooperatives after their establishment, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council promptly issued instructions on strengthening the production leadership and organizational construction of agricultural cooperatives. At the same time, by mid-June 1956, the agricultural loans issued by the National Bank reached more than 1.78 billion yuan (including more than 590 million yuan in poverty alleviation cooperative funds), an increase of four times compared to the same period in 1955. By the end of October, the state had supplied 1.04 million double-wheeled double (single) furrow plows to agricultural cooperatives. There were even more agricultural technology promotion stations and trained technicians established to help farmers improve their farming techniques. At present, more than 14,000 agricultural technology promotion stations have been established nationwide, and 6.4 million various technical personnel have been trained for agricultural cooperatives.

1957 is the last year of the First Five-Year Plan. The task of increasing production of grain, cotton and various cash crops is greater than last year. How to take effective measures to ensure the completion of this year's production increase task is a serious issue. At present, the CPC party organizations in rural areas are further organizing the socialist enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers through the rectification of agricultural cooperatives, through summarizing the annual production work and formulating production plans, and mobilizing all the positive factors that can be mobilized in rural areas, and putting them into winter production activities such as farmland capital construction, field management of overwintering crops, fertilizer accumulation, protection of farm animals and sideline production, so as to prepare for the comprehensive agricultural production increase in 1957.

    个体小农经济面貌改观　农业生产力获得大发展
    全国农村基本实现高级农业合作化
    总结经验　克服缺点　做好准备　迎接1957年的增产任务！
    新华社1日讯　经过1956年社会主义革命运动的高潮，我国农村已经基本上实现了高级形式的农业合作化，提前一年达到了全国农业发展纲要（草案）所规定的要求。
    在1955年年底的时候，高级形式的农业生产合作社还不多；但是到了1956年11月全国的高级农业生产合作社已经发展到四十八万八千多个，每社平均二百零六户，入社农户达一亿多户，约占全国农户总数83％。这样，我国长期分散的个体的小农经济面貌就从根本上改变了，完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社就成为我国农村生产中的主要形式。
    1956年农业合作化运动的发展过程大致是这样：从1月到3月底，运动处在高潮时期，运动的规模继续扩大，运动的主流转向高级合作化。这时，加入农业社的农户占农户总数的比重由63.3％上升到88.9％，基本完成了初级农业合作化；其中加入高级农业社的农户占农户总数的比重上升到54.9％，达到了全国半数以上的农户加入高级社。4月到8月底是农村生产最忙的季节，各地合作化运动的发展暂时停止，转入了整顿和巩固的工作。不过由于四川、甘肃、湖南、内蒙古、陕西、新疆、安徽、江西等省区在运动大体稳定的情况下尚有新的发展，所以全国加入农业社的农户约增加4％，达到了92.9％；其中加入高级农业社的农户增加11.2％，达到了66.1％。9月以后，农村中扩社、并社和初级社转高级社等工作继续开展，其中广东、四川、云南、甘肃、福建、湖北、山东等七省进展较快。据国家统计局的统计，到11月底，全国农业生产合作社（包括高级社）七十六万四千多个，入社农户一亿一千六百七十四万多户，占全国农户总数96.1％。目前，除了有些地区还在继续进行初级社转高级社的工作以外，绝大多数省区正在开展冬季整顿农业社的工作。
    经过一年多的生产实践和各种的考验，充分证明高级形式的农业生产合作社在促进农业生产力的发展，在发展多种经济、改变耕作制度、战胜自然灾害、安置丧失劳动力的农民等方面，比小农经济有着无比的优越性，它的主要表现是增加了生产和增加了大多数农民的收入。1956年是我国农村遭受自然灾害相当严重的一年，仅水灾面积就有一亿八千多万亩。但是在全国范围内，各种主要农作物仍然获得全面增产，产量比丰收的1955年有了显著的增加。例如，粮食就比1955年增产两百多亿斤，棉花增产一百二十二万担。同第一个五年计划原定的1957年指标相比较：超过原定1957年指标的有粮食、烤烟、茶叶和柞蚕茧；棉花同原定1957年指标大体相平。在生产发展的基础上，大多数农民收入比1955年增加，生活得到改善。据各地典型调查，约占农业社社员总数70％到75％的社员比1955年增加了收入，约有10％到15％的社员收入不增不减或者增减不多，约有10％的社员收入减少。如果不是农业合作化，要取得这种成就是不可能的。但是由于农业合作化的时间短，经验不足，遇到了严重的自然灾害，加上不少农村工作人员对于随合作化高潮而来的有利因素看得多，不利因素看得少，因而在工作中表现要求过高过急，简单粗糙，缺乏深入细致地进行思想教育工作和组织工作，等等，也给工作带来了不少缺点和错误。这些复杂的问题，需要在今后工作中进一步加以解决。
    在农业合作化运动的发展中，党和政府采取了一系列有效的措施，并且在财力物力上给予农民以巨大的支援。中共中央及时地反对了在农业合作化运动中的右倾保守思想，促进了合作化高潮的到来；在合作化高潮起来以后，又及时地给了正在向社会主义前进的农民以长期奋斗的目标——十二年全国农业发展纲要（草案），促进了农业生产高潮，发扬了五亿农民和广大农村干部的空前高涨的积极性。为了适应农业社建成之后的生产领导、经营管理和组织建设，中共中央和国务院又及时地发出关于加强农业社的生产领导和组织建设的指示。同时，到1956年6月中旬，国家银行发放的农业贷款就达到十七亿八千多万元（其中包括贫农合作基金五亿九千多万元），比1955年同期增加四倍。到10月底，国家给农业社供应了一百零四万部双轮双（单）铧犁。为了帮助农民改进耕作技术而建立的农业技术推广站和训练的技术人员就更多了，目前全国已经建立了一万四千多个农业技术推广站，训练了农业社各种技术人员六百四十万人。
    1957年是第一个五年计划的最后一年，粮食、棉花和各种经济作物增产任务比去年大，如何采取有效措施保证完成今年的增产任务是一个严重问题。目前，各地农村中共党组织正在通过整顿农业社的工作、通过总结全年生产工作制定生产计划，调动农村一切可以调动的积极因素，把广大农民的社会主义积极性进一步组织起来，投入到农田基本建设、越冬作物田间管理、积肥、保护耕畜和副业生产等冬季生产活动中，为1957年的农业全面增产做好准备。
