Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 1st. The Indonesian Nationalist Party's official newspaper, "Indonesia Torch Daily," pointed out yesterday on its front page with a banner headline: "Foreign Elements Stand Behind the Lubis-Simbolon Activities." The report begins by stating, according to reliable sources, that thorough investigations have proven that the United States is one of the major powers behind the scenes pulling the strings in the Lubis-Simbolon attempt to overthrow the current government.

The newspaper recounts that before the results of the Indonesian general election were announced, individuals from the U.S. State Department closely monitored the election process. They were confident that the Masyumi Party and the Socialist Party would emerge as major parties after the election. If this were the case, they believed Indonesian policy would certainly align with U.S. policy. The newspaper said, however, that facts proved this hope of the United States was dashed. The victory of the Indonesian Nationalist Party and the Nahdlatul Ulama greatly shocked them. Especially when they learned that the Indonesian Communist Party had also emerged as one of the "Big Four" parties, they became even more concerned that Indonesian policy would greatly diverge from U.S. policy.

The newspaper stated that because of this reason, the United States tried every means to make the entire Indonesian public doubt the results of the election. They launched a propaganda offensive in Indonesia aimed at discrediting the election results. The newspaper said that after this attempt failed, the United States resorted to another tactic, using private foundations to assist activities aimed at overthrowing the government, one of which was the "Asia Foundation." In addition, they stirred up regional sentiments in Indonesia to incite antagonism and discontent among the various ethnic groups. The newspaper finally mentioned some recent incidents, which further confirmed the behind-the-scenes activities of foreign elements conspiring to overthrow the Indonesian government. These included the landing of an American plane in North Sumatra before the Simbolon affair. It is reported that this plane, which flew from Bangkok, belonged to U.S. veteran officer Chennault. At the same time, U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, Cumming, also visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressing the United States' desire to recognize the Simbolon regime in fact.

### “印度尼西亚火炬报”揭露  美国是卢比斯——西姆波朗集团的拉线人

    “印度尼西亚火炬报”揭露
    美国是卢比斯——西姆波朗集团的拉线人
    新华社雅加达1日电　印度尼西亚国民党机关报“印度尼西亚火炬报”昨天在第一版以通栏大标题指出：“外国分子站在卢比斯—西姆波朗活动后边”。这篇报道开始就据可靠方面人士说，根据深入调查，证明美国是卢比斯—西姆波朗企图推翻现政府活动的幕后拉线的大国之一。
    报纸回溯说，在印度尼西亚普选结果公布以前，美国国务院人士即已密切地注视着这次普选的进行，他们确信马斯友美党和社会党将在普选后作为大党出现。如果这样，可以确定印度尼西亚的政策必将会符合于美国的政策。报纸说，然而，事实证明，美国的这种希望落空了，印度尼西亚国民党和伊斯兰教师联合会的胜利使它们大为震惊。特别是当它们知道印度尼西亚共产党也作为“四大党”之一出现的时候，它们更耽心印度尼西亚的政策同美国的政策会大大分歧。
    报纸说，因为这个原故，美国就想尽办法来使印度尼西亚全体社会公众怀疑大选的结果。它们在印度尼西亚展开了目的在于抹煞大选结果的宣传攻势。报纸说，在这个企图破产后，美国又施用另一种手法，就是用私人的基金会来协助企图推翻政府的活动，其中的一个就是“亚洲基金会”。此外，它们又煽起印度尼西亚的地方情绪，以引起各民族间的对立和不满情绪，报纸最后还提到了最近发生的一些事例，这些事例更证实了外国分子正在进行企图推翻印度尼西亚政府阴谋的幕后活动，那就是在西姆波朗事件发生前有一架美国飞机在北苏门答腊降落，据悉，这架从曼谷飞来的飞机属于美国退伍军官陈纳德的。同时，美国驻印度尼西亚大使柯明也往访外交部，表示了美国要在事实上承认西姆波朗政权的愿望。
