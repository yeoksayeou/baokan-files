Xinhua News Agency, January 8th, Budapest Dispatch: According to a TASS report from Budapest: Hungarian workers, peasants, and intellectuals are enthusiastically supporting the declaration of the Workers and Peasants Revolutionary Government regarding current important tasks.

Budapest newspapers and radio stations provided extensive commentary on January 7th, considering the declaration a programmatic document that points out the path for Hungary's economic construction, state construction, and cultural construction in the future.

The Budapest "Evening News" editorial stated that the declaration is a political program, and the government will conduct negotiations with people from all walks of life and non-Party experts based on this program.

The newspaper then pointed out that the government is formulating a detailed plan based on this declaration. People and experts from all parties, non-party members, and all walks of life have also been included in the work of formulating the plan. This plan will be submitted to the upcoming National Assembly meeting for discussion.

The newspaper expressed its conviction that the government's declaration will promote further unity among the Hungarian people in socialist construction.

Xinhua News Agency, January 8th, Budapest Dispatch: Several leaders of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and several ministers of the Workers and Peasants Revolutionary Government explained the government's recently published declaration on current important tasks to members of the Socialist Workers' Party, workers, and peasants in various regions on the 6th.

Minister of State Marosan broadly introduced the government's current goals and tasks to miners in the Komló coal region. The main content of his speech was about the participation of working people in the management of state affairs.

Minister of Agriculture Dregely spoke to more than 500 members of agricultural production cooperatives, individual farmers, and railway workers in Tombavaár. He explained in detail the tasks related to agriculture in the government's declaration.

First Deputy Minister of Agriculture Magari analyzed the agricultural situation after the October events at a meeting of leaders of agricultural production cooperatives, machine tractor stations, and agricultural experts in Szombathely. He pointed out that 87% of the sowing plan has been completed nationwide, and machine tractor stations have completed 80% to 85% of the plan. He said that we have preserved most of the production cooperatives and also re-established 195 new cooperatives. He encouraged everyone to work hard to complete the task of agricultural production.

Minister of Finance Kossa talked about the current economic situation to party and non-party masses and miners at an open party meeting in Várpalota. He pointed out that due to the shortage of raw materials and coal, some factories will have to temporarily suspend production, and the number of workers in some factories will be reduced. If coal production can reach the figures before the October events, unemployment can be avoided. He called on workers to actively produce and help the country overcome this difficult period. Kossa said that in view of the serious mistakes recently made by Imre Nagy, the government cannot cooperate with him.

    新华社布达佩斯8日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党的几位领导人、工农革命政府的几位部长，6日在各地向社会主义工人党党员、工人、农民等阐明政府最近发表的关于当前重要任务的声明。
    国务部长马罗山在柯姆洛煤区向矿工们广泛地介绍了政府当前的目标和任务，他谈的主要内容是关于劳动人民参加国家事务的管理的问题。
    农业部长德盖伊在托姆巴瓦尔向五百多名农业生产合作社社员、个体农民和铁路工人讲话。他详细地说明了政府声明中关于农业方面的任务。
    农业部第一副部长马加里在松巴特利城农业生产合作社、机器拖拉机站领导人和农业专家的会议上，分析了十月事件后的农业状况。他指出，目前匈牙利全国已经完成了播种计划的87％，机器拖拉机站也完成了计划的80％至85％。他说，我们保存了大部分的生产合作社，同时还重新建立了一百九十五个新的合作社。他勉励大家努力完成农业生产的任务。
    财政部长科沙在瓦尔波拉塔公开的党的会议上，对党与非党群众和矿工们谈到了目前的经济情况。他指出由于原料和煤的不足，有些工厂将要暂时停止生产，某些工厂的工人将要减少。如果煤的产量能够达到十月事件以前的数字，就可以避免失业的现象。他号召工人积极生产帮助国家渡过这个困难的时期。科沙说，鉴于伊姆雷·纳吉最近所犯的重大错误，政府不可能同他合作。
