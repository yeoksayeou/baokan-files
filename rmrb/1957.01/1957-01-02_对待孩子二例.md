    Two Examples of Treating Children
    Ji Han
    The children of a certain elementary school in Haidian District, Beijing, came up with all sorts of ideas to play during their spare time. – The school's recreational equipment was insufficient, so the children thought of ways themselves. Who can say they're not good? For a while, they all liked to fold "flying arrows" out of waste paper and compete to see who could launch them the highest and farthest. The children all liked this cheap and fun toy. But later, this game suddenly stopped. It turned out there was a reason.
    Next to the school was a highway. One day, a high-ranking official was passing by in a car. One of the "flying arrows" released by the children happened to float into the car. Unexpectedly, the car stopped, and the guard saw that the children were playing a game, so he scolded them and left. The children looked at each other and hurried back to the classroom. Afterwards, the school received a phone call, blaming the teachers for being too "lenient" with the students. It's not known whether this was based on the "instructions" of that official, or if the guard acted on his own accord. The result of this blame made the school very nervous, so they had to ban this game. The children felt wronged, but they couldn't do anything about it.
    The phone call didn't specify which unit this official was from, and others had no way of knowing what kind of person he was, or how he happened to be passing by the school. But in any case, to interfere with the legitimate activities of the children by the roadside because of such a small matter that could have been laughed off is both unreasonable and legally baseless.
    Here, I am reminded of another matter. In early 1956, some leading comrades from the Ministry of Electric Power Industry went to Beihai Park and saw that the water flowing from Shichahai into Beihai was quite substantial. They thought of using this water flow to build a hydroelectric power station for the children, so that they could learn about hydroelectric power generation knowledge and skills firsthand. Two months ago, a beautiful new building appeared among the greenery of Beihai Park, emitting brilliant lights at night, reflecting the clear waters of Beihai. This is the fully automated Beijing Young Pioneers Hydropower Station, built with the initiative and support of some responsible comrades of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry.
    The same passing by, the same dealing with children's affairs, here we see two completely different attitudes. Many people often speak in unison about caring for and educating the next generation, but when it comes to specific matters, they are not so consistent.

    对待孩子二例
    季涵
    北京市海淀区某小学的孩子们，在课余时间想出了各种各样的主意来玩。——学校里的文娱活动设备不够，孩子们自己来想办法，谁能说他们不好呢？曾有一段时间，他们都喜欢用废纸折“飞箭”来玩，比赛谁放得高、放得远。孩子们都喜欢这种又省钱又好玩的玩意儿。可是后来这种游戏忽然停止了，原来事出有因。
    学校旁边是一条公路。一天，有一位首长乘着小汽车路过。孩子们放的“飞箭”恰巧有一张飘进了汽车里，不料车停下来，警卫员看是孩子们在做游戏，才斥骂一顿而去。孩子们面面相觑，赶快往教室里跑。事后，学校里接到一个电话，责备说是教师太“放纵”学生了。这不知是出于那位首长的“指示”，抑或是警卫员自作主张。而这一责备的结果，使得学校十分紧张，只好取缔这项游戏，孩子们有委屈也顾不得了。
    那电话中没有说明这位首长是那一个单位的，别人无从得知他是何等样人，他又是怎样路过这学校。但是，无论如何，因为这么一件本来可以一笑了之的小事，而干涉起路旁孩子们的正当活动，却是既于理不通，更于法无据的。
    在这里我想到了另外一件事情。1956年年初，电力工业部有一些负责同志到北海公园，看到什刹海流入北海的水流量比较大，便想到利用这股水流，为孩子们修建一座水力发电站，让他们实地学习水力发电的知识和技能。两个月以前，在北海公园的绿荫丛中，出现了一座美丽的新建筑物，在夜间放出灿烂的灯光，辉映着北海的碧波。这就是在电力工业部的一些负责同志倡议和支持下建立起来的全部自动化的北京少先队水电站。
    同是一次过路，同是对待孩子们的事情，在这里我们看到了两种迥然不同的态度。有许多人常常异口同声讲到关心、教育第二代，可是临到具体事情，就不是那么一致了。
