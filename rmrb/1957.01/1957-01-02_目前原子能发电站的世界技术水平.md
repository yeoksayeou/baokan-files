    Current World Technical Level of Atomic Power Stations
    Kong Xi'an

    The science and technology of atomic power station reactors have made rapid progress in recent years. Scientists and engineers from different countries have made great efforts, sooner or later, and have achieved corresponding successes. The Party and the government have issued a call to advance towards science, to catch up with the world's advanced level of science in twelve years. Let us all step over the threshold of the atomic age and master the basic knowledge of atomic reactors.

    Basic Types of Atomic Reactors
    Nuclear physicists, according to the neutron energy spectrum, call neutrons with energy between ten and one hundred electron volts slow neutrons; call neutrons with energy above one million electron volts fast neutrons; and call neutrons between the above two medium-speed neutrons. Therefore, the types of atomic reactors are correspondingly divided into slow neutron, medium-speed neutron, and fast neutron reactors. Slow neutron reactors and medium-speed neutron reactors must have a moderator, generally called thermal neutron reactors; while fast neutron reactors do not need this material.

    According to the distribution of fissile material in the moderator or coolant, it may be in some forms that are uniform or lumpy or rod-shaped. Therefore, reactors can be divided into homogeneous reactors and heterogeneous reactors. If the fissile material or atomic fuel is very uniformly dissolved or suspended in the moderator or coolant, it is called a homogeneous reactor; if not, it is called a heterogeneous reactor.

    According to the form of the cooling material, reactors can be divided into water-cooled reactors, gas-cooled reactors, and liquid metal-cooled reactors.

    Water-cooled reactors are further divided into boiling water reactors and non-boiling water reactors: if the cooling water boils in the same tank as the atomic fuel and generates steam, it is called a boiling water reactor; if the steam is not generated in the same tank as the atomic fuel, but in the steam generator set up in the first or second loop of water cooling, it is called a non-boiling water reactor; light water (i.e., ordinary water) or heavy water can be used for water cooling.

    When it does not turn into steam in the water circulation loop and has a relatively high pressure, it is also called a pressurized water reactor.

    A reactor that uses gas as the coolant is called a gas-cooled reactor. Someone has suggested using helium, but only air and carbon dioxide have actually been used. Recently, an American scientist is preparing to use organic gas.

    A reactor that uses liquid metal as the coolant is called a liquid metal-cooled reactor. Currently, the metals used are sodium, bismuth, and sodium-potassium alloy.

    A fast neutron reactor refers to a reactor in which atomic fuel undergoes a chain reaction by neutrons moving at high speed.

    A breeder reactor refers to a reactor in which more new fissionable atoms are produced than are burned.

    When a reactor has both the conditions of a fast neutron reactor and the form of a breeder reactor, it is called a fast breeder reactor. Sometimes it is also called a fast breeder.

    Graphite, Light Water, and Heavy Water
    The Soviet Academy of Sciences first used a graphite water-cooled reactor to build the world's first 5,000-kilowatt atomic power station. It basically belongs to the type of graphite water-cooled reactor and is also a type of pressurized water reactor.

    As everyone knows, the world's first atomic power station built by the Soviet Union used 5% enriched uranium-235 as atomic fuel, with a total weight of about 550 kilograms. It has a graphite stack with 128 working channels as the core of the neutron moderation reactor, and the pressure is maintained at 100 atmospheres. The cooling water in the first loop takes away the large amount of heat energy released by the atomic fuel, and in the steam generator, the water in the second loop is converted into steam, which drives the steam turbine generator set to generate electricity and supply it to urban residents and industrial power. This power station will always be called "the world's first" in the history of atomic power development. Glory belongs to the Soviet scientists and its design engineers.

    A larger-scale atomic reactor that uses graphite for moderation and light water for cooling is the atomic energy experimental research power station conducted by the American General Electric Company in Hanford. The main difference between it and the first Soviet atomic power station is that General Electric adopts horizontal working channels in the graphite stack of the reactor, while the Soviet Union uses vertical working channels.

    Many atomic reactors do not use graphite but use light water for moderation. For example, the demonstration atomic power station with a power generation capacity of 100 [unclear unit, assumed to be kilowatts] jointly built by the US Atomic Energy Commission and Westinghouse Electric Company is like this. In addition, some atomic power stations have switched to light water for moderation.

    Generally speaking, scientists who study atomic reactors almost always start with graphite reactors. Because graphite moderation reactors are more stable and easier to control; at the same time, there is more technical data available for reference. Comparing moderators, light water is better than graphite, and heavy water is better than light water. Because the performance and efficiency of thermal neutron reactors can be improved by reducing the absorption of neutrons by the moderator. Heavy water has a weaker ability to absorb neutrons. Therefore, the performance and efficiency of heavy water reactors are higher than that of graphite reactors or light water reactors. In addition, heavy water reactors can use natural uranium, and the cost of atomic fuel is lower; however, the price of heavy water is expensive, and the equipment cost is higher.

    Currently, there are also many heavy water reactors, such as the 6,500-kilowatt heavy water reactor of the Soviet Academy of Sciences for experimental purposes, and the 100 [unclear unit, assumed to be kilowatts] heavy water reactor of the US Oak Ridge National Laboratory for experimental purposes. Among the five experimental reactors being designed by the US Atomic Energy Commission, with power generation capacities ranging from 61 to 248 [unclear unit, assumed to be kilowatts], three are heavy water reactors.

    The UK imported heavy water from Norway and built a heavy water reactor with a heating capacity of 10 [unclear unit, assumed to be kilowatts]. Harwell scientists lamented: "Heavy water is thirty-five times more expensive than whiskey!" Currently, the price of heavy water is about 60 to 90 US dollars per kilogram.

    Canada, taking advantage of the low electricity cost of hydroelectric power generation, first built an atomic power station with a power generation capacity of 20 [unclear unit, assumed to be kilowatts] for experimental purposes and an atomic power station with a power generation capacity of 200 [unclear unit, assumed to be kilowatts] currently being designed. The reactors both use heavy water for cooling and moderation.

    A nuclear reactor tested by Norwegian scientists with a power generation capacity of 2.5 [unclear unit, assumed to be kilowatts] is also a heavy water reactor.

    As materials for atomic reactors, graphite, light water, or heavy water each have their advantages and disadvantages. Designers should consider how to obtain materials locally, adapt to local conditions, and make atomic power stations use good and economical materials, and generate more electricity quickly.

    Gas Cooling and Liquid Metal Cooling
    While scientists and engineers in various countries were studying light water and heavy water cooling, British and French scientists began to use gas cooling for atomic reactor research. Since 1946, the UK has established the Atomic Energy Research Institute in Harwell to carry out various research works related to atomic energy. When they were conducting research on the first reactor, they used graphite moderation and carbon dioxide gas for cooling. They also considered using helium for cooling, but it did not materialize because the UK could not find enough helium.

    The two atomic reactors built by France in Marcoule, one uses air cooling and the other uses carbon dioxide cooling. They both use graphite moderation. The working channels in the graphite stack all adopt a horizontal arrangement, and natural uranium is used as atomic fuel.

    The main disadvantage of gas-cooled reactors is that they consume a large amount of electricity to promote gas circulation, so the total output of the reactor is inevitably greatly reduced. Despite the views of many engineers, the "Calder Hall" atomic power station, with a total power generation of 200 [unclear unit, assumed to be kilowatts], built in northern Cumberland by the UK, still uses carbon dioxide as the coolant. The reason is that British scientists and engineers have gained relatively rich experience in gas-cooled reactors. The plutonium production reactor built in Windscale in northern England has been using carbon dioxide cooling from 1947 to the present.

    The Soviet Union and the United States have not used carbon dioxide as the coolant for reactors.

    Cooling materials and cooling engineering are not unfamiliar to power engineers. For example, the turbine generator sets used in power stations have long used air cooling, water cooling, and hydrogen cooling. However, the topic of using liquid metal as the coolant for atomic reactors is indeed a new issue worthy of study.

    Currently, the only liquid metals used as coolants for atomic reactors are sodium, bismuth, and sodium-potassium alloy. Among them, sodium and sodium-potassium alloy are used more. Liquid metal cooling has the advantages of both gas cooling and water cooling, and its main advantage is that it can adapt to low pressure and high temperature, and the thermal efficiency of the power station is also relatively high. Among the above three liquid metals, sodium-potassium alloy is the most suitable because sodium-potassium alloy is liquid itself at ordinary room temperature.

    The US Argonne National Laboratory used liquid metal sodium-potassium alloy as the coolant for the fast breeder reactor in 1951. North American Aviation designed a 75 [unclear unit, assumed to be kilowatts] atomic power station for the Columbus Public Power Company in Nebraska, which also uses liquid metal cooling. It uses liquid metal sodium, with a maximum temperature of 925 degrees Fahrenheit.

    In addition, there are four other reactors in the United States that use liquid metal cooling, three of which use liquid sodium and one uses liquid metal sodium-potassium alloy. The Soviet Union and the United Kingdom are also conducting experiments on liquid metal-cooled reactors.

    Homogeneous Reactors and Fast Breeder Reactors
    Homogeneous reactors and heterogeneous reactors have fundamental differences: on the one hand, homogeneous reactors use a uniform flowing liquid for the fuel and heat transfer agent, while the atomic fuel of heterogeneous reactors forms rods, plates, or tubes, and the heat transfer medium may be gas, liquid, or solid; on the other hand, homogeneous reactors take a large-bellied bottle-shaped core like a double-layered kettle, and a spherical outer package, while heterogeneous reactors mostly take graphite stacks with working channels left. In heterogeneous reactors, moderators and coolants are almost always needed, while homogeneous reactors have a flowing liquid itself carrying heat transfer function. If a homogeneous reactor adopts the fast breeder working principle, it does not even need a moderator at all. For example, the homogeneous fast breeder reactor designed by the Soviet Academy of Sciences is like this.

    At the same time, the US Oak Ridge National Laboratory also announced that they are designing a homogeneous fast breeder reactor.

    The Oak Ridge Laboratory designed two reactors, one with a power generation capacity of 2 [unclear unit, assumed to be kilowatts] and the other with a power generation capacity of 100 [unclear unit, assumed to be kilowatts]. The working principles and the atomic fuel and heat transfer agents to be used for these two reactors are exactly the same as those of the Soviet Union.

    Dutch scientists also announced at the Geneva Conference a design for a homogeneous reactor that uses light water.

    A small fast breeder reactor was tested at the Argonne National Laboratory in the United States in 1951. Now they are designing a fast breeder reactor power station with a power generation capacity of 20 [unclear unit, assumed to be kilowatts]. In terms of working principle, it is exactly the same as the Soviet fast breeder reactor.

    The US Atomic Energy Development Association is planning to build a fast breeder reactor power station with a power generation capacity of 90 [unclear unit, assumed to be kilowatts] in Michigan, based on the working principle of the Argonne Laboratory's fast breeder reactor.

    The UK Atomic Energy Authority is preparing to build a 60 [unclear unit, assumed to be kilowatts] experimental fast breeder reactor, using enriched uranium-235 and uranium-238 in combination as atomic fuel, and using liquid metal sodium as a coolant. It does not require power generation, but is only prepared to use it to produce plutonium.

    In addition to the various types of reactors mentioned above, at the Geneva International Conference, the US Brookhaven National Laboratory also announced a liquid metal fuel reactor.

    目前原子能发电站的世界技术水平
    孔赐安
    原子能发电站反应堆的科学技术，在最近几年中，有着飞跃的进展。不同国家的科学家和工程师或先或后地都作了巨大的努力，取得了相应的成就。党和政府发出了向科学进军的号召，要在十二年内把我国科学赶上世界先进水平。让我们大家一起来跨进原子能时代的门槛，掌握原子能反应堆的基本知识。
    原子能反应堆的基本类型
    核子物理学家，按中子能谱划分，把具有能量在十到一百电子伏特之间的中子叫做慢中子；把具有能量在一百万电子伏特以上的中子叫做快中子；把在上述两者之间的中子叫做中速中子。因而原子能反应堆的类型也就相应地分成慢中子、中速中子和快速中子反应堆。慢中子反应堆和中速中子反应堆必须具备减速剂，一般称为热中子反应堆；而快速中子反应堆则不需要这项材料。
    依照分裂物质在减速剂或冷却剂中的分布情况，可能是均匀的也可能是块状或棒状的一些形式，因此，反应堆又可以分做均匀反应堆和非均匀反应堆。分裂物质或原子燃料很均匀地溶解或悬游在减速剂或冷却剂内的，就叫做均匀反应堆，不是这样的就叫做非均匀反应堆。
    依照冷却物质的形态，反应堆又可以分做水冷式反应堆，气冷式反应堆和液态金属冷却式反应堆。
    水冷却反应堆又分沸腾式和非沸腾式两种类型：凡冷却用水在和盛原子燃料同一器罐内沸腾而产生蒸汽的，就叫做沸腾水式反应堆；蒸汽的产生不在和盛原子燃料同一器罐之内，而于水冷第一循环回路或第二回路所设的蒸汽发生器内产生的，就叫做非沸腾水式反应堆；水冷却可以使用轻水（即普通水），也可以使用重水。
    在不化为蒸汽水循环的回路里，并具有比较强大的压力时，又叫做压力水式反应堆。
    用气体作为反应堆的冷却剂的就叫做气冷反应堆。有人建议过采用氦气，但实际被采用的仅有空气和二氧化碳气两种，最近美国一个科学家准备采用有机气体。
    使用液态金属作为反应堆冷却剂的，叫做液态金属冷却反应堆，目前被采用的金属有钠、铋和钠钾合金。
    快速中子反应堆是指原子燃料在反应堆中由带高速运动着的中子进行链式反应的反应堆。
    孳育反应堆是指在某一些反应堆中，新产生出来的可分裂的原子比它所烧掉的还多的反应堆。
    既具备快速中子反应堆的条件，又具备孳育反应堆的形式时，就叫做快速孳育反应堆。有时也叫做快速孳育器。
    石墨、轻水和重水
    苏联科学院首先采用石墨水冷反应堆建造了世界第一个五千瓩原子能发电站。它基本上从属于石墨水冷反应堆的类型，也是压力水式反应堆的一种。
    大家知道，苏联建立的世界第一个原子能发电站，是以5％的浓缩铀235作为原子燃料，全部重量约为五百五十公斤。它具有一百二十八条工作孔道的石墨砌层，作为中子减速反应堆的内心，压力保持在一百个大气压。第一回路中的冷却用水把原子燃料所释放出来的大量热能带出来，而在蒸汽发生器里使第二回路的水化为蒸汽，冲动汽轮发电机组，产生电能，供给城市居民和工业动力的应用。这个电站在原子动力发展史上，将永远被称为“世界第一个”。光荣属于苏联科学家和它的设计工程师们。
    石墨减速、轻水冷却规模比较大的原子能反应堆，要算是美国奇异电器公司在汉福特所进行的原子能试验研究电站了。它和苏联第一个原子电站主要不同之点是，奇异公司在反应堆石墨砌层里采取横式工作孔道，而苏联则应用竖式工作孔道。
    有许多原子能反应堆不用石墨而采用轻水减速，例如，美国原子能委员会和西屋电机公司联合建立的发电容量为一百?的表演性的原子电站就是这样。此外，还有一些原子电站都是改用轻水减速的。
    一般说来，进行研究原子能反应堆的科学家，几乎都是先从石墨反应堆着手研究的。因为石墨减速反应堆比较稳定而且易于控制；同时，可供参考的技术资料也比较多。拿减速剂来比较，轻水比石墨好，重水又比轻水好。因为热中子反应堆的性能和效率，可以由降低减速剂对中子的吸收而有所提高。重水对中子的吸收能力比较弱。因此，重水反应堆的性能和效率就比石墨反应堆或轻水反应堆来得高些。此外，重水反应堆可以使用天然铀，原子燃料成本较低；但重水的价格昂贵，设备成本费却较高。
    目前，重水反应堆也不少，例如苏联科学院为进行实验用的六千五百瓩重水反应堆，美国橡脊国立实验所为进行实验用的一百?重水反应堆。美国原子能委员会正在设计的五个试验性的反应堆，发电容量从六十一到二百四十八?，其中有三个都是重水反应堆。
    英国从挪威进口重水建成了一个发热容量为十?的重水反应堆。哈威尔科学家心疼地叫喊道：“重水比威司忌酒贵三十五倍！”目前重水价格每公斤约自六十到九十美元。
    加拿大利用水力发电电费成本低廉的有利条件，第一次建成一个作为试验用的、发电容量为二十?的原子能电站和目前正在设计的发电容量为二百?的原子电站，反应堆都是采用重水冷却和减速的。
    挪威科学家试制的一个发电容量为二点五?的原子能反应堆，也是重水反应堆。
    作为原子能反应堆的材料石墨、轻水或重水，各有它的优缺点。设计人应该考虑如何就地取材，因时制宜，使原子电站用料又好又省，发出电力又多又快。
    气冷和液态金属冷却
    在各国科学家和工程师们研究轻水重水冷却的同时，英国和法国的科学家们，开始采用气冷进行原子能反应堆的研究。英国从1946年起，在哈威尔成立的原子能研究所，进行着各式各样有关原子能的研究工作。他们在进行第一个反应堆研究时，曾以石墨减速二氧化碳气体进行冷却。他们也考虑过采用氦气冷却，但因为英国找不到足够数量的氦气，所以没有实现。
    法国在马绍尔建造的两个原子能反应堆，一个采用空气冷却，一个采用二氧化碳冷却。它们都采用石墨减速。石墨砌层里的工作孔道一律采用横式，以天然铀作为原子燃料。
    气体冷却反应堆的主要缺点，是消耗大量的电能，促使气体流通，因而反应堆的总出口就不可避免地大大降低。尽管许多工程师的看法是这样，但英国在寇伯兰北部建设的总发电量二百?的“开德豪尔”原子能发电站，仍然采用二氧化碳作为冷却剂。原因是英国科学家和工程师们在气冷反应堆方面已经取得了比较丰富的经验。英国北部风尺地方所建造的生产钚的反应堆，从1947年起到现在，一直采用着二氧化碳冷却。
    苏联和美国都没有采用二氧化碳作为反应堆的冷却剂。
    冷却材料和冷却工程对于动力工程师来说，都不是什么生疏的问题。例如，电站所用的汽轮发电机组，早已采用了风冷、水冷和氢冷。但是采用液态金属作为原子能反应堆的冷却剂这一课题，确是值得研究的一个新问题。
    目前，液态金属被采用为原子能反应堆冷却剂的只有钠、铋和钠钾合金三种。其中尤以钠和钠钾合金被采用的比较多。液态金属冷却具备气冷和水冷两者的优点，而其最主要的优点是它能够适应低压高温，电站热效率也比较高。上述三种液态金属，尤以钠钾合金最适用，因为钠钾合金在普通室温情况下，本身就是液态。
    美国亚岗诺国立实验所，在1951年就以液态金属钠钾合金作为快速孳育反应堆冷却剂。北美航空公司替奈勃洛斯克州哥伦布区公共电力公司设计的一个七十五?的原子电站，也采用液态金属冷却。它使用液态金属钠，最高温度为华氏九百二十五度。
    此外，美国采用液态金属冷却的反应堆还有四处，其中有三处使用液态钠，一处使用液态金属钠钾合金。苏联和英国也都在进行液态金属冷却反应堆的实验。
    均匀反应堆和快速孳育反应堆
    均匀反应堆和非均匀反应堆有着基本上的区别：一方面，均匀反应堆的燃料和输热剂采用一种均匀的流动液体，而非均匀反应堆的原子燃料则形成棒状、板状或管状，输热体则可能为气体、液体或固体；另一方面，均匀反应堆采取像双层釜式的一个大肚瓶状内心，和一个球状外包，而非均匀反应堆，则多采取石墨砌层中留出工作孔道。在非均匀反应堆里，几乎都需要减速剂和冷却剂，而均匀反应堆，则流动液体本身就附带着输热作用。如果均匀反应堆采取快速孳育工作原理，就根本连减速剂也不需要。例如苏联科学院进行设计的均匀式快速孳育反应堆就是这样。
    和这同时，美国橡脊国立实验所也宣布了他们正在设计的均匀式快速孳育反应堆。
    橡脊实验所设计了两个反应堆，一个发电容量为二?，另一个为一百?。这两个反应堆的工作原理以及要使用的原子燃料和输热剂，同苏联完全相同。
    荷兰科学家在日内瓦会议上也宣布过他们一种均匀反应堆的设计是采用轻水的。
    小型快速孳育反应堆，在美国的亚岗诺国立实验所于1951年试验过。现在他们正在设计一个发电容量二十?的快速孳育反应堆发电站。在工作原理上，它和苏联的快速孳育反应堆一式一样。
    美国原子能开发协会，正在根据亚岗诺实验所快速孳育反应堆的工作原理，在密歇根州筹建一个发电容量为九十?的快速孳育反应堆发电站。
    英国原子能委员会，准备建造一个六十?的实验性的快速孳育反应堆，采用浓缩铀235和铀238配合作为原子燃料，而以液态金属钠作为冷却剂。它不要求发电，只准备用它来生产钚。
    除掉以上所述各式各样的反应堆外，在日内瓦国际会议上，美国勃鲁克海汶国立实验所还曾宣布过一种液态金属燃料反应堆。
