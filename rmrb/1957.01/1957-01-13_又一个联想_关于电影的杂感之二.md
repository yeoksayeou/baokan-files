    Another Association
    Random Thoughts on Movies (Part 2)
    Zibu
    In this year's New Year's Day "Wenhui Daily," Comrade Bai Yang published an article, including a paragraph titled "A Little Association," where she connected movies to the People's Suit.
      "To give an example, when I look at this photo of myself, at the People's Suit in the photo, I can't help but feel a deep emotion from the bottom of my heart; it's as if I see the dividing lines of my life's path from the photo. A simple People's Suit, for me, marks the boundary between breaking through the old society and entering the new society, the boundary between being liberated and not yet liberated. This deep-seated passion often makes people unable to help but shed tears of joy.
    I'm not trying to compare post-liberation movies to the People's Suit, I'm saying that I've had some associations. Post-liberation movies have moved and inspired millions of Chinese people, and have played a significant role in the people's construction of a new life, this is one aspect. The achievements of domestic films are not satisfactory, the production is small, and there are phenomena of formulaic, conceptual, and monotonous content, and there are many shortcomings, this is also one aspect. But this cannot obscure the achievements of post-liberation cinema, it has written an unprecedented new page in the history of Chinese cinema. Speaking of this, I can't help but bring up the things that happened last year when the People's Suit was 'ridiculed' and 'uglified' due to the advocacy of beautifying clothing. Therefore, I can't help but worry whether the promotion of the film industry today will cause an unnecessary misconception like that of the People's Suit? Speaking of the People's Suit, it did indeed play a role in changing customs, making people across the country trend towards simplicity, and even stirring up a joy of participating in revolutionary work in people's emotions."
    After liberation, the Party and the government did not issue orders requiring everyone to wear People's Suits, and even no leaders specifically wrote articles to promote them, but the People's Suit became a prevailing fashion. Is the People's Suit beautiful? It's hard to say; is it economical? Not necessarily, it is said that female comrades have to spend more fabric. Why is it so popular? Why has no one raised any opinions from 1949 to 1955? Why was there a big reversal in 1956 that ultimately failed to eliminate it? Answering these questions is not simple, but I believe that what Comrade Bai Yang said, that it "did indeed play a role in changing customs, ...and even stirring up a joy of participating in revolutionary work in people's emotions," cannot be said to be a very important reason.
    I say this not to insist that everyone continue to wear People's Suits, nor do I think that People's Suits should be fully affirmed without any shortcomings. I agree with this analogy because I think that when discussing or criticizing a social phenomenon or trend, we should objectively analyze the internal and external causes of this phenomenon or trend, and if possible, we should give a fair and reasonable evaluation of the merits and demerits of this phenomenon or trend.
    When many cartoonists and essayists were vigorously criticizing the People's Suit last year, an elderly cartoonist, Mr. Feng Zikai, drew a cartoon with independent opinions in the Shanghai News Daily, and also wrote a poem. This year on New Year's Day, he wrote another "Small Feeling" about this:
    "On November 25, 1956, I published a small painting in the News Daily. The painting depicts three strangely shaped women: one woman has a bun on her head, more than a foot high. The eyebrows of the second woman are painted very wide, occupying half of the forehead. The sleeves of the third woman's clothes are very large, dragging on the ground for seven or eight feet, and then turning a corner and piling up on the ground. The painting is titled: 'The city likes high buns, so the regions make them a foot high. The city likes wide eyebrows, so the regions make them half the forehead. The city likes big sleeves, so the regions use a whole bolt of silk.' There is also small print below the title: 'Book of Later Han, Ballad of Chang'an. Note: Changing politics and customs must have its roots. What those above like, those below must overdo. Painted by Zikai in late autumn of 1956.'
    "Recently, after some calls were made, I seemed to see many strangely shaped and intensified situations in society like these three women, so I drew this painting.
    "I only hope that there will be no more such strangely shaped and intensified situations after 1957."
    I think these words are worth pondering. Opposing the formulaic and conceptual nature of domestic films does not necessarily require us to arbitrarily uglify past domestic films, and today, even though the people's ideology has greatly improved, we should also consider: if we confuse conceptualization and formulaic content with ideology and policies, and negate past domestic films without analysis, and one-sidedly emphasize "box office value", then, is it possible that certain kinds of "strange shapes" will be produced, just like the clothing problem?
    In the midst of gongs and drums, many people are also discussing the tradition of Chinese cinema. In my personal opinion, the history of Chinese cinema is relatively short, and it may not have a relatively complete tradition like opera and music, but there is no doubt that Chinese cinema has accumulated a lot of experience in fighting against various erroneous ideologies in the past two decades. The most important of these is that we have adhered to the policy of cinema serving the revolution and serving the people, stubbornly opposed the tendency of cinema for cinema's sake and art for art's sake, and opposed treating cinema as a commodity and using box office value as a standard for judging the quality of films, which is the bourgeois ideology. Around 1933, when the Kuomintang reactionaries could not use the death penalty and prisons to scare the then surging progressive film movement, they called all films with patriotism and democratic ideas "hard-core films," and relatively put forward the slogan of "soft-core films." Their theory was: watching movies is for entertainment, not for listening to "preaching", so they gave "soft-core films" an advertising slogan called: "Give the eyes ice cream and let the soul sit in an armchair". But as a result, this reactionary theory and practice was quickly eliminated under the fierce attack of the vast number of progressive cultural workers. What makes us gratified is that many progressive film workers who participated in this struggle are still sticking to the glorious people's film posts today, and some film workers who advocated "soft-core films" at that time have finally joined our ranks after ideological transformation.
    With the progress of socialist construction and the improvement of people's living standards, people's clothing will certainly change, and people's cultural food will also become richer and more colorful day by day. Changing is the general trend and the demand of the people, but it must be changed well and changed correctly, and don't change back to the old path. What should be affirmed should be affirmed, what should be criticized should be criticized, and what should be insisted on must be insisted on. In between, what is needed is objective analysis, calm discussion, and comradely criticism and self-criticism. I cannot agree with some of the arguments in Comrade Zhu Zhuzhu's article published in "Wenhui Daily" on January 4, but I very much agree with the title of this article: "For the Sake of Progress." Li Bi, a great politician of the Tang Dynasty, said very well: "The reason for saying this is not to blame the past, but to be careful about the future." Everyone's purpose is to be careful about the future, then the attitude of blaming should naturally be comradely criticism rather than complaints and venting.

### 又一个联想  关于电影的杂感之二

    又一个联想
    关于电影的杂感之二
    子布
    今年元旦的“文汇报”上，发表了白杨同志的一篇文章，其中一段是：“一点联想”，她从电影联想到人民装。
      “打个比方，我瞧着自己这张照片，瞧着照片上这身人民装，不自觉地会从内心深处涌出一种深重的感情；就像从照片上看到了自己生命道路上的界限。一身普通的人民装，对于我标志着冲破旧社会和跨入新社会的界限，解放了与未解放的界限。这种内心深处的激情，往往使人忍不住喜悦得流下眼泪。
    我不是想把解放后的电影比作人民装，我是说我有过一些联想。解放后的电影曾经感动了鼓舞了千千万万的中国人民，在人民建设新的生活中起了很大的作用，这是一面。国产片的成绩是不能令人满意的，产量少，存在着公式化、概念化、千篇一律的现象，缺点不少，也是一面。但这不能遮掩住解放后的电影的成就，它已在中国电影史上写下了前所未有的崭新的一页。说到这里，我又想扯到去年由于提倡美化服装，对人民装有过‘嘲笑’、‘丑化’的一些事情。因此，我便不免过虑地想，在推进电影事业的今天，会不会引起像对人民装那样一种不必要的错觉？说起人民装，确实曾经起过移风易俗的作用，使全国人民趋向朴实，甚而在人们的感情上也激起一种参加革命工作的喜悦。”
    解放之后，党和政府并没有下命令要大家一律穿人民装，甚至也没有什么领导人特别写文章提倡过，但是人民装却蔚然成了风气。人民装美吗？很难说；经济吗，也不一定，据说对女同志还得花较多的布料。为什么这样流行？为什么从1949年到1955年一直没有人提出意见？为什么1956年曾经大大地反过一阵而终于没有被反掉？要回答这些问题并不简单，而我以为白杨同志所说的它“确实曾经起过移风易俗的作用，……甚而在人们的感情上也激起一种参加革命工作的喜悦”，不能不说是一个很重要的原因。
    我这样说并没有坚持要大家继续穿人民装的意思，也并不认为人民装应该全盘肯定而一无缺点。我同意这个比喻，是认为在讨论或者批判一种社会现象、风气的时候，应该很客观地分析一下产生这种现象、风气的内内外外的原因，假如可能的话，也应该对这种现象、风气的好坏、功过，给以公平合理的评价。
    当去年许多漫画家杂文家大张旗鼓地批评人民装的时候，一位年高的漫画家丰子恺先生在上海新闻日报上画了一幅具有独立见解的漫画，同时还题了一首诗，今年元旦，他对此又写了一段“小感”：
    “1956年11月25日我曾经在新闻日报上发表一张小画。画中描着三个奇形怪状的女人：一个女人头上梳一个髻，有一尺多高。第二个女人的眉毛画得很阔，占据了半个额骨。第三个女人的衣服的袖子非常大，拖在地上的有七八尺，又转个弯堆在地上。这幅画上写着一个画题：‘城中好高髻，四方高一尺。城中好广眉，四方且半额。城中好大袖，四方全匹帛。’画题下面还有小字：‘后汉书、长安城中谣。注云：改政移风，必有其本。上之所好，下必甚焉。1956年深秋子恺画。’
    “近来有些号召提出之后，我似乎看见社会上有许多同这三个女人一样奇形怪状、变本加厉的情况，因此画这幅画。
    “我但愿1957年以后不再有这种奇形怪状、变本加厉的情况出现。”
    我认为这几句话很值得我们深思。反对国产电影的公式化概念化，不一定要任性地对过去的国产片加以丑化，而今天，尽管人民群众思想有了很大的提高，也还应该设想到：假如把概念化公式化和思想性政策性混淆起来，不加分析地否定过去的国产影片，片面地强调“票房价值”，那么，是不是也和服装问题一样，有可能产生某一类的“奇形怪状”呢？
    锣鼓声中也有许多人在讨论中国电影的传统。我个人看法，中国电影历史较短，不一定像戏曲、音乐那样的已经有了一种比较完整的传统，但是，毫无疑问，二十多年以来，中国电影却也积累了不少和各种错误思想作斗争的经验。其中最重要的一条，就是我们坚持了电影为革命服务，为人民服务的方针，顽强地反对了为电影而电影、为艺术而艺术的倾向，反对了将电影看作商品，用票房价值来作为影片好坏标准的资产阶级思想。1933年前后，当国民党反动派不能用死刑和监狱来吓倒当时风起云涌的进步电影的时候，他们曾经把一切具有爱国主义和民主思想的电影叫做“硬性电影”，而相对地提出过“软性电影”的口号。他们的理论是：看电影是为了娱乐，不是为了听“说教”，所以他们给“软性电影”作了一副广告式的标语，叫做：“给眼睛吃冰淇淋，让心灵坐沙发椅”。但是其结果，这一反动的理论和实践在广大进步文化工作者的猛击之下，很快就消灭了。值得我们欣慰的是，当年参加这一斗争的许多进步电影工作者今天还坚持在光荣的人民电影的岗位上，而当时主张过“软性电影”的一部分电影工作者，经过思想改造，也终于投身到我们的行列中来了。
    随着社会主义建设事业的进展，随着人民生活的提高，人民的服装一定会起变化，人民的文化食粮也一定会日新月异地丰富多采。改，是大势，也是人民群众的要求，但是一定要改得好，改得对，不要改到过去的老路上去。要肯定的应该肯定，要批判的应该批判，要坚持的就一定要坚持。这之间，需要的是客观的分析，冷静的探讨，同志式的批评与自我批评。我不能同意朱煮竹同志1月4日在“文汇报”上发表的文章中的某些论点，但是我很赞成这一篇文章的题目：“为了前进”。唐朝的一位大政治家李泌有一句话讲得很好：“所以言之者，非咎既往，乃欲慎将来耳”。大家的目的都是为了慎将来，那么，咎的态度也就很自然地应该是同志式的批评而不是牢骚和泄愤了。
