    Hong Kong News: When well-known figures from Hong Kong's industrial, commercial, and cultural sectors, as well as various labor unions, commented on the Hong Kong British authorities' "Report on the Riots in Kowloon and Tsuen Wan," they demanded that the authorities take responsibility and prevent the recurrence of riots.
    Wu Zhongchao, Vice-Chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said: "The riots that occurred in the past were unfortunate events. Industrialists, businessmen and the general public felt uneasy and hoped that similar incidents would not happen again." Liang Canhui, Director of the North and South Firms Association, demanded that the authorities swiftly and severely punish the culprits and quickly compensate the victims of the riots. Several heads of industry associations stated that riots should not be allowed to happen again, and the Hong Kong authorities should take their responsibility for public security seriously.
    Ma Jian, a retired professor from the University of Hong Kong, said that the Hong Kong Governor's statement in a letter to the British Colonial Secretary that "the danger of incidents similar to those that erupted in October still exists" is unsatisfactory. Hong Kong residents do not want this danger to persist, and the Hong Kong authorities should resolutely take responsibility for maintaining public security. Chen Junbao, Vice-Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Reform Association, commented on this point, saying that the Hong Kong Governor did not specify what kind of danger it was, nor did he say how to deal with this danger. Does this statement mean that the authorities do not have the ability to eliminate this danger and ensure the safety of residents?
    Ma Wenhui, who frequently participates in social activities, said that the Hong Kong authorities did not take adequate precautions beforehand, were at a loss when the incident occurred, and did not take effective measures afterward. Ma Wenhui said that the report did not address the root causes of the incident, implying it was avoiding the issue. He also said that the instigators of the riots were like harmful bacteria; if they are not eradicated in time, they will spread rapidly and expand the harm. However, the report did not mention the punishment of the instigators.
    The Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile Dyeing Workers' General Union and the Hong Kong and Kowloon Enamelware Workers' General Union also held meetings of worker representatives, respectively, to criticize the report of the Hong Kong British authorities. Worker representatives pointed out that the report touched upon some facts regarding the Kuomintang secret agents' organized and premeditated instigation of the riots, but drew contrary conclusions, which is contradictory. The claim of "left and right wings" is inconsistent with the facts. The worker representatives pointed out that the report mentioned that figures, including Kuomintang members, held a special meeting at Huaxing School on the evening of October 10th in Tsuen Wan. It also mentioned that the 14K gang, which participated in the riots, was a semi-official political underground organization of the Kuomintang, and other signs during the riots were all evidence of Kuomintang secret agents instigating the riots. Many worker representatives also listed facts at the meeting about how Kuomintang secret agents premeditatedly, organizationally, and systematically carried out the riots. The worker representatives demanded that the Hong Kong British authorities severely punish the culprits and resolutely take effective measures to earnestly protect the safety of the lives and property of workers and residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon, rather than merely being "vigilant." The worker representatives believed that it would be worthwhile if the Hong Kong British authorities considered compensating the residents for their losses. They demanded that the Hong Kong British authorities promptly take responsibility for compensation, so that the families of the deceased can receive consolation and the losses of workers and residents can be reasonably compensated.
    The Hong Kong and Kowloon Rubber and Plastics Industries General Union commented on the report, saying: The Hong Kong British authorities have acknowledged some of the facts of the riots in Kowloon and Tsuen Wan, and considering compensation, although belated, is still one of the measures that should be responsibly taken at present. This General Union also believes that the Hong Kong British authorities should eliminate the source of the trouble as soon as possible, and bring the instigators and ringleaders to justice to effectively protect the safety of the lives and property of the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon.
    Workers from various industries and victims in the Tsuen Wan area, who were subject to frenzied attacks by Kuomintang secret agents, pointed out: The Hong Kong Governor's statement that "there is no evidence to suggest that it was premeditated" not only contradicts the facts he pointed out, but will also effectively exonerate the Kuomintang secret agent perpetrators. The workers also said: The Kuomintang secret agents' atrocities in Hong Kong are already notorious. People who are not forgetful will remember the Kashmir Princess aircraft incident, the Yang Jie incident, and so on. The Hong Kong British authorities must take effective measures to eliminate the hidden dangers before they emerge.
    The heads of Yang Xiang Kee in Sham Shui Po, Kowloon, and Fuhe Furniture Shop in Kowloon City also demanded that the Hong Kong authorities apprehend the culprits and bring them to justice to appease public anger. Xin Zhong, Da Fa, Yi Long, Da Feng, Da Peng, Tian Fu, Zhong Jian, De Feng and other food companies and the Nanhua Toys and Metal Products Factory in Kowloon, which were destroyed by rioters, also wrote to the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the Importers and Exporters Association on the 18th, respectively, requesting them to ask the Hong Kong authorities to promptly provide compensation, apprehend the perpetrators, and earnestly protect the safety of residents' lives and property.

    香港各界评英国当局报告书
    要求严惩元凶　防止暴乱重演
    新华社广州22日电　香港消息：香港知名的工商界、文化界人士和各工会组织在评论香港英国当局关于“九龙及荃湾暴动报告书”时，要求当局负起责任，防止暴乱重演。
    中华总商会副会长吴仲朝说：“过去发生的暴乱是件不幸的事情，工商业者和一般居民都感到不安，希望以后不再有同样事情发生”。南北行公所理事长梁灿辉要求当局迅速严办元凶，并且迅速赔偿暴乱事件中的受害者。有好几家行业商会的负责人都说：暴乱今后不容许再发生，香港当局应认真负起治安责任。
    香港大学的退休教授马鉴说，香港总督在给英国殖民部大臣的信中所谓“类似十月所爆发之事件，其危险仍常存在”的说法是不能令人满意的，香港居民不希望这种危险仍常存在，香港当局应坚决地负起维持治安的责任。香港华人革新协会副主席陈君葆并就这一点发表评论说，香港总督没有说出它是怎样的危险，也没有说如何处置这种危险，这样说法是否等于说当局没有能力负起消灭这种危险、保证居民安全的责任？
    经常参与社会公众活动的马文辉说，香港当局事前没有妥为防范，事发时束手无策，事后又没有采取有效措施。马文辉说，报告书没有谈到肇事的祸根，是不是说明它讳疾忌医？他又说，暴乱事件的祸首好似有害的细菌，如果不及时根除就会迅速蔓延，扩大祸害，但是报告书并没有提到惩处祸首的问题。
    港九纺织染业职工总会和港九搪瓷业总工会并曾分别举行工人代表会议，对香港英国当局的报告书作了批评。工人代表指出，报告书对国民党特务有组织、有预谋地制造这次暴动事件，是接触到了一些事实，但是都作出了相反的结论，这是互相矛盾的。关于“左右翼两派”的说法，是和事实不相符的。工人代表们指出，报告书中提出荃湾方面在10月10日晚上有包括国民党党员在内的人物曾在华兴学校举行特别会议，同时提到参加暴乱的十四K党是国民党半官式政治性的地下组织，以及在暴乱期中的其他种种迹象，都是国民党特务分子制造暴乱的明证。许多工人代表还在会上列举了国民党特务如何有预谋有组织有计划进行暴乱的事实。工人代表们要求，香港英国当局应严惩元凶，并坚决采取有效措施，切实负责保障港九工人居民生命财产的安全，而不应仅止于“警惕”。工人代表认为：香港英国当局考虑赔偿居民的损失，如果能够这样做是值得重视的，他们要求香港英国当局迅速负责赔偿，使死者遗属得到抚恤，工人居民的损失得到合理的补偿。
    港九树胶塑胶业总工会评论报告书说：香港英国当局承认了九龙及荃湾暴乱的一些事实，并且考虑赔偿，虽为时较迟，仍不失为当前应当负责的措施之一。这个总工会也认为，香港英国当局应该及早消除祸源，缉拿祸首元凶归案法办，以切实保障港九同胞的生命财产安全。
    曾受国民党特务疯狂袭击的荃湾地区的各业工人和受难者指出：香港总督说“并无任何证供，足以谓之为有事先预谋”，这样的结论不但与它所指出的事实相矛盾，而且将在实际上为国民党特务凶手开脱罪名。工人们还说：国民党特务分子在香港的暴行早已臭名昭著，人们如不善忘，当还记得克什米尔公主号飞机事件、杨杰事件等等。香港英国当局必须采取有效的措施，消祸患于未然。
    九龙深水埗杨祥记、九龙城福和做木家私店的负责人也都要求香港当局缉拿祸首归案法办，以平民愤。曾遭暴徒捣毁的九龙新中、大发、益隆、大丰、大鹏、天福、中健、德丰等家食品公司和南华玩具金属制品厂18日并分别写信给中华总商会和出入口商会，请代他们要求香港当局迅速进行赔偿，并缉凶归案，切实保障居民生命财产安全。
