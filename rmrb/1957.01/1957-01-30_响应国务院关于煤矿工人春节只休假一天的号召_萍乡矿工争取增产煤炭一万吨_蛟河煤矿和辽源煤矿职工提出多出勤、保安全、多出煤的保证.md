Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, January 29th: The entire workforce of the state-owned Pingxiang Coal Mine enthusiastically responded to the State Council's call for coal mine employees to take only one day off during the Spring Festival, unanimously guaranteeing normal attendance on February 1st and 2nd, ensuring that coal production during these two days will not be lower than the average daily output, striving to increase coal production for the country by 10,000 tons, and ensuring safe production.

    On January 27th, worker's meetings were held at the Wangjiayuan, Anyuan, Gaokeng, Qingshan, and other mines of the Pingxiang Coal Mine. At the meetings, workers actively put forward guarantees for full attendance and safe production. Workers who had already applied for leave to return home submitted their leave slips on the spot. Many workers who had already bought train tickets to go home also prepared to return them. Workers at the Qingshan Mine also passed a resolution guaranteeing full attendance at the meeting, proposing a competition to other fraternal mines.

    Prior to this, the employees of the Pingxiang Coal Mine had already enthusiastically engaged in the campaign to increase production and practice economy. On January 27th, the entire mine workforce had already completed the January coal production plan ahead of schedule; the coal production in twenty-seven days exceeded the coal production in January of last year by 30%.

    Currently, the responsible personnel of the Chinese Communist Party organizations, administrative departments, trade unions, and Communist Youth League of the Pingxiang Coal Mine have all gone deep into the mines. They will persist on the production front during the Spring Festival, just like the production workers. The canteens of each unit are also rushing to prepare rich festive meals for the workers; the clubs are intensifying rehearsals of various literary and artistic programs to ensure that the employees who continue to produce can have a rich and varied festive life.

    Our newspaper, Changchun, January 29th: The coal miners in Jilin Province put forward the slogan "Producing Coal First, Celebrating the Spring Festival Second" in response to the State Council's call to produce more coal. Employees of the Tonghua Mining Bureau, Liaoyuan Mining Bureau, and Jiaohe Mining Bureau have expressed that they will only take one day off during the Spring Festival. Many workers had already bought train tickets and prepared to go home for the Spring Festival; now they are voluntarily returning their tickets and not going home. Lin Qingfa, a worker at the Lao Fangzi pit and a veteran transferred from the military, has not been home for eleven years. He originally planned to go home this Spring Festival, but now he has decided not to go home. The Jiaohe Mining Bureau and the Liaoyuan Mining Bureau have held symposiums for days, guaranteeing to work more shifts, ensure safety, and produce more coal during the Spring Festival. The Tonghua Mining Bureau workers decided on the afternoon of the 27th to produce an extra 1,500 tons of coal for the country within fifteen hours. The Jilin Provincial Committee of the China Coal Mine Trade Union has sent two working groups to the Jiaohe and Liaoyuan coal mines to help with the work. Leading personnel of various mining bureaus have gone to the front line to specifically organize production work.

    Our newspaper, Nanjing, January 29th: After the news of the State Council's call for coal mine employees across the country to take two fewer days off during the Spring Festival to increase coal production reached the Jiawang Mining Bureau, all employees enthusiastically responded to this call and voluntarily gave up their holidays.

    In the past two days, the workers' enthusiasm for production has been even higher. The Xiaqiao Mine, which completed the January plan two and a half days ahead of schedule, estimates that it can increase production by more than 6,000 tons of coal by the end of the month, and has decided to increase production by another 5,000 tons of coal during the two days of Spring Festival holiday when production will continue as usual. The Third Coal Mining District of this mine, which completed the coal mining plan ahead of schedule last year, guarantees to increase production by 1,300 tons of coal in two days. Carpenter Xiao Qinpei said: "The compatriots in the disaster area are waiting for coal fires, it doesn't matter to us whether we celebrate the Spring Festival or not." Li Fengshan, an old electromechanical worker at the Hanqiao Mine who is 72 years old and still unwilling to retire, has decided not to rest for even one day during the Spring Festival and to work with the young people.

    萍乡矿工争取增产煤炭一万吨
    蛟河煤矿和辽源煤矿职工提出多出勤、保安全、多出煤的保证
    新华社南昌29日电　国营萍乡煤矿全体工人热烈响应国务院关于煤矿职工春节休假一天的号召，一致保证2月1日、2日两天正常出勤，使这两天煤产量不低于平均日产量，争取为国家增产一万吨煤，并且切实做到安全生产。
    1月27日，萍乡煤矿王家源、安源、高坑、青山等矿都召开职工大会。会上工人们纷纷提出全勤和安全生产的保证。已经请假准备回家的工人，当场就送回请假条。许多早就买好回家车票的工人，也都准备退票。青山矿的工人在会上还通过一项保证全勤的决议，向各兄弟矿提出竞赛。
    在此以前，萍乡煤矿的职工们已经热烈投入增产节约运动。全矿职工在1月27日就提前完成了1月份煤炭产量计划；二十七天中的煤炭产量超过去年1月份产量的30％。
    现在，萍乡煤矿中共党组织、行政、工会、青年团负责人员已经全部深入矿场，他们将和生产工人一样，坚持在生产战线上度过春节。各单位食堂也正在为工人赶做丰盛的节日菜饭；俱乐部正加紧排练各种文艺节目，保证照常生产的职工能够过丰富多采的节日生活。
    本报长春29日电　在吉林省的煤矿工人提出“生产煤炭第一，过春节第二”的口号，响应国务院多出煤炭的号召。通化矿务局、辽源矿务局和蛟河矿务局职工纷纷表示在春节期间只休假一天。许多工人本来都买了火车票，准备回家过春节；现在主动退票，不回家。老房子坑工人林庆发是个转业军人，十一年没回家，本来打算今年春节回家，现在决定不回家了。蛟河矿务局和辽源矿务局职工连日召开座谈会，保证在春节期间多出勤、保安全、多出煤。通化矿务局职工27日下午决定在十五小时内为国家多生产出一千五百吨煤，中国煤矿工会吉林省委员会已经派出两个工作组，到蛟河和辽源煤矿去帮助工作。各矿务局领导人员都纷纷下现场，具体地组织生产工作。
    本报南京29日电　国务院号召全国煤矿职工春节少休假两天增产煤炭的消息传到贾汪矿务局后，全体职工热烈响应这一号召，自动放弃休假。
    近两天来，职工生产情绪更加高涨。提前二天半全面完成1月份计划的夏桥矿估计到月底能超额增产六千多吨煤，并且决定在春节休假期间照常生产的两天中，再增产五千吨煤。这个矿在去年提前完成采煤计划的采煤三区，保证两天增产一千三百吨煤。木工萧钦佩说：灾区同胞在等煤火，我们过不过春节没啥关系。韩桥矿年已七十二岁尚不肯退休的老机电工李凤山，决定春节一天也不休息，和小伙子们一起干。
