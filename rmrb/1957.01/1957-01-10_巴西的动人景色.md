　　Visiting Deputy Head of the South American Chinese Art Troupe, Wang Li
　　Rio de Janeiro faces the beautiful Copacabana Beach and is backed by many strange peaks; although September is still winter here, it is full of lush tropical flowers and plants everywhere.
　　The natural scenery of Brazil is moving, but even more moving is the Brazilian people's nationalistic sentiment and their feelings towards China.
　　In the Brazilian Parliament, since the delegation of visiting Chinese parliamentarians returned home last July, talking about China has become a fashion. When the wives of these parliamentarians appeared at parties wearing dazzling Chinese brocade evening gowns, people asked about China with envious eyes.
　　The Speaker of the Brazilian Senate, concurrently held by Vice President Goulart, is the leader of the Labor Party. The Brazilian Labor Party has a relatively clear nationalist stance and holds the most seats in Parliament.
　　President Kubitschek belongs to the Social Democratic Party, and his government is supported by the Labor Party. In the Brazilian Parliament, the Social Democratic Party's seats are to the right of the Labor Party, and the National Democratic Union's seats are to the left.
　　The leaders of all parties in both houses of the Brazilian Parliament warmly received the Chinese Art Troupe and, without exception, expressed their goodwill towards People's China.
　　Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kubitschek government once refused to issue visas to the Chinese Art Troupe, it re-issued a statement expressing goodwill towards the Chinese Art Troupe within forty-eight hours, in response to the wave of protests from all sides. Foreign Minister Soares also received the leaders of the art troupe at the opening performance, expressing the hope for the development of cultural ties between Brazil and China.
　　In her box filled with women wearing colorful low-cut long dresses, President Kubitschek's wife told the leaders of the art troupe: "The President is very willing to see you, but he is regrettably unable to come due to a minor illness."
　　Under the auspices of the President's wife, the Chinese Art Troupe held a charity performance for the President's wife's charity. In the Maracanã indoor stadium, 25,000 Brazilians gathered, expressing the Brazilian people's warm friendship towards the Chinese with continuous applause, cheers, and waving handkerchiefs. President Kubitschek also presented a flower basket with a card that read "Congratulations and Thanks."
　　At that time, the Brazilian media was commenting on three major events: first, Brazil abolished the secret agreement signed with the United States regarding the American use of Brazilian uranium mines and decided to nationalize uranium; second, it rejected the US proposal to form a South Atlantic Defense Treaty; and third, it warmly received the Chinese Art Troupe.
　　We saw the strong national sentiments expressed by Brazilians everywhere. One day, the driver of the taxi we were riding in pointed to a peculiar modern building in the city center and called it a "den of thieves." Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be the American Embassy, flying the Stars and Stripes.
　　When the Speaker of the Rio de Janeiro City Council, Pais Leme, received us, he rang the bell to announce a one-hour recess, and all the councilors hosted the Chinese Art Troupe in the form of a tea party. We saw someone offer the Speaker a "Lucky Strike" American cigarette, but he immediately took out his own cigarette and said, "Brazilians smoke Brazilian cigarettes." He then sighed with emotion: "Even Brazilian cigarettes are influenced by the United States." It turned out that the brand of the cigarette was "Hollywood."
　　The conversation with the representative figure of the Brazilian bourgeoisie, Simões Filho, was meaningful.
　　One evening, the leaders of the art troupe visited Simões Filho. Simões Filho used to be a great Brazilian poet, and now he is a big industrialist, a director of the largest newspaper and magazine company, a friend of the President and the Mayor, and a prominent figure in Brazilian high society. This time, he had also made some efforts to obtain visas for the Chinese Art Troupe from the government.
　　He first introduced himself: "I am a dead poet, an active industrialist."
　　He frankly said: "I cannot call myself a friend of China. However, I have special feelings for China: from childhood, I had mythological dreams about China, which later gradually became blurred; and China in recent years has given me new stimulation. You have stood up and are rapidly becoming rich and strong."
　　When we talked about the fact that China and Brazil, these two great countries, have many things in common, Simões Filho said: "Today, Brazil still has many difficulties. As a Brazilian, I hope that China's today can be Brazil's tomorrow."
　　Simões Filho did not forget that he was a politician. He said: "I advise your art troupe to let politics sleep. Today, Brazilians can only watch your artistic performances; tomorrow, Brazilians may be interested in seeing your country's politics." This made us all laugh. We said: "Even if Brazilians are interested in seeing China's politics today, the actors of the Chinese Art Troupe do not have the ability to perform this." Simões Filho said: "I think this is the best politics." Simões Filho expressed his willingness to establish contact with China, saying: "I am very willing to know how China embarked on the road to prosperity."
　　If we saw the Brazilian people's nationalistic sentiments in Rio de Janeiro, then in São Paulo, we further saw the Brazilian people's strong desire to develop their own national economic strength.
　　São Paulo was a small town with less than 10,000 people more than a hundred years ago, and it had only about one million people more than a decade ago, but during the Second World War and the war years, this city developed into a large industrial city with a population of three million and about 40,000 to 50,000 factories. Brazilians call São Paulo "the Shanghai of Brazil."
　　The things that Brazilians are economically proud of are: first, the nationalization of steel; and second, the nationalization of oil.
　　In front of the São Paulo History Museum, Brazilian architects designed a spiral-shaped building as a symbol commemorating the nationalization of Brazilian oil. People make this symbol into small badges and wear them on their chests.
　　During our stay in São Paulo, President Kubitschek came to São Paulo to attend the ceremony for the start of production at a newly built automobile factory. This automobile factory is operated using West German capital and technology. The conditions put forward by the Brazilians for using West German capital and technology are: first, to encourage investment in heavy industry, especially the machinery industry; and second, after a certain period of time, these factories will belong to Brazil.
　　The Mayor of São Paulo, Dr. Biza, said when receiving the leaders of the art troupe, "Brazil and China are two emerging and strong countries, and Brazilians pay great attention to China's experience." The Mayor is currently studying Mao Zedong's works, and he expressed a strong interest not only in China's economic construction but also in China's social reforms.
　　Mr. Mataresso, a large coffee planter living in São Paulo, also expressed his desire to visit China when hosting a banquet for the leaders of the Chinese Art Troupe. This coffee planter is also the curator of the São Paulo Museum of Modern Art, and he said: "I will go to China to see only art, not politics."
　　"Brazil is very similar to China," "Brazil is friendly to China," these were the voices that the Chinese Art Troupe heard everywhere in this largest country in South America. (Attached picture)

    巴西的动人景色
    访南美中国艺术团副团长  王力
    里约热内卢面临着美丽的可巴加巴拉海滩，背靠着许多奇异的峰峦；虽然9月在这里还是冬季，但已到处是浓艳的热带花草。
    巴西的自然景色是动人的，但更加动人的是巴西人的民族主义情绪和对中国的情感。
    在巴西的议会中，自从去年7月访华议员代表团回国以后，谈论中国就成为一种时尚。当这些议员的夫人们穿着耀眼的中国锦缎料子的夜礼服，出现在晚会上时，人们都以欣羡的目光来询问中国。
    巴西参议院的议长是副总统古拉特兼任的，他是劳工党领袖。巴西劳工党有着比较明朗的民族主义的主张，在议会里的席位最多。
    库比契克总统是属于社会民主党的，他的政府得到劳工党的支持。在巴西的议会大厅里，社会民主党的席次是在劳工党的右边，全国民主联盟的左边。
    巴西上下两院各党团的领袖都盛情地接待了中国艺术团，无例外地对人民中国表示好感。
    库比契克政府的外交部虽然曾经一度拒发中国艺术团的签证，但在四十八小时之后，便重新发表了一个对中国艺术团表示好感的声明，来回答各方面人士抗议的浪潮。外交部长索雷斯先生，也在开幕演出时，接见了艺术团的领导人，表示了巴中两国发展文化联系的愿望。
    库比契克总统夫人在自己的挤满着穿着各色袒胸长裙妇女的包厢里，告诉艺术团的领导人：“总统很愿意看到你们，因为偶有小恙，遗憾地没有能够来。”
    在总统夫人的主持下，中国艺术团为总统夫人的慈善事业举行了一场义演。在马拉加尼亚室内运动场里，集聚着的两万五千个巴西人，他们以连续的鼓掌、欢呼和挥动手帕，表示了巴西人对中国人的热烈友谊。库比契克总统也赠送了一个花篮，附了一张写着“祝贺和感谢”的名片。
    当时，巴西的舆论界正评论着三件大事：一，是巴西废除了和美国签订的关于美国使用巴西铀矿的秘密协定，决定铀矿国有化；二，是拒绝美国提出的组织南大西洋防御公约的建议；三，是盛情接待中国艺术团。
    我们到处都看到巴西人所表现出来的强烈的民族情感。一天，我们乘坐的出租汽车的司机，指着建筑在市中心的一幢奇特的现代化房屋叫“贼窝”，仔细一看，原来是挂着星条旗的美国大使馆。
    当里约热内卢市议会的主席巴依斯·李米接见我们的时候，他摇铃宣布休会一小时，全体议员以茶会形式招待中国艺术团。我们看到，有人拿了一支美国的“幸运牌”香烟给议长先生抽，他立即拿出了自己的烟，说道：“巴西人抽巴西烟”。他又感慨地叹了一口气：“就连巴西烟，也受了美国影响”，原来这盒烟的牌子叫“好莱坞”。
    巴西的资产阶级代表性人物司密脱和我们的交谈是意味深长的。
    一天晚上，艺术团领导人访问了司密脱。司密脱过去曾经是巴西的大诗人，现在是大产业家，也是最大的报纸、杂志公司的董事，是总统和市长的朋友，是巴西上层社会中的风云人物。这次，为了向政府争取发给中国艺术团的签证，他也曾作过一番努力。
    他首先作自我介绍：“我是一个死了的诗人，活动着的产业家。”
    他坦率地说：“我并不能称自己为中国的朋友。但是，我对中国有着特殊的情感：从小时候起，就对中国有着神话式的梦想，后来慢慢地迷茫了；而中国最近这几年来又给了我新的刺激，你们站立起来了，而且迅速地富强起来了。”
    当我们讲到中国和巴西这两个伟大国家有着许多共同点的时候，司密脱说：“今天的巴西还有着许多困难。作为一个巴西人，我希望中国的今天，能够是巴西的明天。”
    司密脱并没有忘记自己是一个政治家。他说：“我劝你们艺术团的政治睡觉。今天巴西人只能看你们的艺术表演；明天，巴西人可能有兴趣看你们国家的政治。”这使得我们都笑起来了。我们说：“即使今天巴西人有兴趣要看中国的政治，中国艺术团的演员们也没有这种表演的本领。”司密脱说：“我认为，这便是最好的政治。”司密脱表示愿意和中国建立联系，他说：“非常愿意知道中国是如何走上富强道路的。”
    如果说，我们在里约热内卢看到了巴西人的民族主义情感，在圣保罗，就进一步看到了巴西人发展自己国家经济力量的强烈愿望。
    圣保罗市，在一百多年前，还是一个不足一万人口的小城，十多年前，也不过有一百万人左右，但是在第二次世界大战期间及战争的年代中，这个城市却发展成为拥有三百万人口和大约有四、五万家工厂的大的工业城市。巴西人称圣保罗叫“巴西的上海。”
    巴西人在经济上引以为骄傲的：一是钢铁国有化；二是石油国有化。
    在圣保罗市历史博物馆门前，巴西的建筑家设计了一个螺旋式的建筑物，作为纪念巴西石油国有化的标志。人们把这个标志制成小徽章，挂在自己的胸襟上。
    我们停留在圣保罗期间，库比契克总统来到圣保罗，参加一个新建的汽车工厂开始生产的典礼。这家汽车工厂是利用西德资本和技术经营的。巴西人提出利用西德资本和技术的条件是：一，鼓励投资重工业，特别是机械工业；二，是经过一定的时间之后，这些工厂将要属于巴西所有。
    圣保罗市市长比萨博士在接见艺术团领导人时说，“巴西和中国是两个新兴图强的国家，巴西人非常注重中国的经验。”市长先生正在研读毛泽东的著作，他表示不仅对中国的经济建设，而且对中国的社会改革也感到浓厚的兴趣。
    住在圣保罗市的一个大咖啡园主马太罗梭先生在宴请中国艺术团领导人时，也表示了访问中国的愿望。这位咖啡园主同时是圣保罗近代艺术馆馆长，他说：“到中国去，只看艺术，不看政治。”
    “巴西很像中国”，“巴西对中国友好”，这是中国艺术团在这个南美洲最大的国度里，到处听到的声音。（附图片）
