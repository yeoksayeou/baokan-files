Precious Cultural Relics Excavated from Shizhaishan Mountain
	Yue Xian, Tai Chu, Yang Jie

More than three thousand precious ancient artifacts from the late Warring States period to the two Han dynasties have been unearthed at the Shizhaishan ancient ruins in Jinning County, Yunnan Province. This is an important discovery, and it is significant for the study of ancient society in Yunnan.

A total of a dozen ancient tombs have been excavated successively, and there are many kinds of cultural relics unearthed, especially bronzes. Among them are weapons, production tools, daily necessities and decorations; there are also ironware, jade, agate, turquoise, gold and other objects, as well as decayed lacquerware.

Among these bronzes, there are several most precious bronze drum-shaped shellfish-containing vessels. On the lids of some of them, a complete set of war scenes is cast: a general on horseback leads soldiers in fighting with the enemy. The soldiers are either holding various weapons, or carrying the heads of the enemies, or being tied up as prisoners, or lying injured on the ground. This vividly reflects the situation of ancient wars. There are also two lids cast with scenes of human sacrifice, with as many as one hundred people on each piece. Dozens of decorative bronze buckles have also been found. On the buckles, some are cast with semi-three-dimensional hunting warriors, some are cast with the image of wild animals fighting with domestic animals, some are cast with groups of dancing figurines, and some are cast with waterfowl or exotic beasts. The vividness and liveliness of these shapes, and the exquisiteness of the casting, show that the Dianchi area had reached a considerable mature level in culture and copper smelting technology at that time.

On many bronze weapons, various exquisite birds and animals and diverse patterns are also cast; a small number of iron weapons are also equipped with gold-made sheaths; some weapons still retain the original wooden handles, which are painted with red, green, and black patterns.

Among these bronzes, more than a dozen complete bronze plows and bronze hoes were also found, and some of them still retain a section of wooden handle. From the installation of the wooden handles, it can be seen that hand plows were still used at that time, which is very precious material for studying the productivity of the Dianchi area during the Han Dynasty.

In addition, four bronze mirrors were found in the bronzes, one of which was cast with as many as seventy-two characters of seal script inscriptions; two Western Han Ban Liang coins, Eastern Han Wu Zhu coins and a copper seal were also found. There are also some crude pottery that may be from the primitive society.

The cultural relics excavated this time are roughly the same as those excavated in 1955 in terms of region, image, and era. According to preliminary judgment, they belong to the late Warring States period to the Two Han Dynasties.

These tombs may be ancient tomb complexes containing cultural relics from different eras. What is particularly noteworthy is that these cultural relics have Yunnan local characteristics and unique ethnic styles. From the facial features, hairstyles, costumes of some bronze figurines, the style of many bronzes, and the content it expresses, it represents a culture of ethnic minorities in the Dianchi area, but it is not developing in isolation, but has been influenced by the cultures of other ethnic groups, especially the Han culture has a greater influence.

The discovery of these cultural relics has high scientific value for the study of the history of ancient society in Yunnan, and provides us with new research materials.

At present, the Yunnan Provincial Museum is sorting out and studying these cultural relics, and the excavation work is still in progress.

    石寨山上发掘出的珍贵文物
    月仙　太初　杨玠
    又有三千多件战国末期到两汉时期珍贵的古文物，在云南省晋宁县石寨山古遗址里被发掘出土了。这是一个重要的发现，对研究云南古代社会是有意义的。
    这次先后发掘出来的古代墓葬共计十几处，出土文物的种类很多，尤其铜器最多。其中有兵器、生产工具、生活用具和装饰品等类；还有铁器、玉器、玛瑙、绿松石、黄金等类的器物和残朽的漆器等。
    在这些铜器里，有几件最珍贵的铜鼓形装贝的器皿。它们的盖子上，有的铸着整套战争的场面：一位骑马的将军，带领着士兵在同敌人搏斗，士兵们或执着各种兵器，或提着敌人的首级，或被缚当了俘虏，或受伤躺在地下。这正形象地反映了古代战争的情况。还有两件的盖子上，铸着杀人祭祀的场面，每件上多至一百多人。还发现有几十件装饰用的铜扣，扣子上面，有的铸着半立体的狩猎武士，有的铸着野兽同家畜搏斗的形象，有的铸着成组的舞俑，有的铸着水禽或异兽。这些造型的生动、活泼，铸工的精美，正说明了当时滇池地区在文化上和冶铜技术上已达到相当成熟的境界。
    在许多铜兵器上，也铸有各种精细的鸟兽和多样的纹饰；有少部分铁兵器上，还装有黄金做成的匣套；部分兵器，还保存着原来的木柄，木柄上绘有红、绿、黑三色漆的花纹。
    在这些铜器里，还发现有十几件完整的铜犁和铜锄，有几件还保存着一段木柄。从木柄的安装情况来看，可以知道当时还使用手犁，这对于研究滇池地区汉代生产力的情况，是十分珍贵的材料。
    此外，在铜器里还发现了四件铜镜，其中有一件铸有多达七十二个字的篆书铭文；又发现有西汉的半两钱二枚，东汉的五铢钱和铜印一颗。还有的可能是原始社会的粗质陶器。
    这次发掘的文物同1955年发掘的地区、形象、时代大致相同，据初步判断，当系战国末期至两汉时代。
    这些墓葬，可能是包括不同时代文物的古墓群。特别值得重视的，是这些文物具有云南地方特色和独特民族风格。从一些铜俑的面型、发式、服装和许多铜器的风格以及它所表现的内容上看，它代表着一种滇池地区少数民族的文化，但是它又不是孤立地发展的，而是曾经受到其他民族文化的影响，特别是汉族文化的影响更大。
    这些文物的发现，对研究云南古代社会的历史，具有很高的科学价值，为我们提供了新的研究资料。
    目前，云南省博物馆正在对这些文物进行整理和研究，发掘工作也还在继续进行。
