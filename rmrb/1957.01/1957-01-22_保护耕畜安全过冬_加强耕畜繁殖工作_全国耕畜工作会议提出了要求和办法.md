Xinhua News Agency Report:

    The National Draft Animal Work Conference, which closed on the 18th, requires all localities to combine the current rectification of societies and winter production to list the safe overwintering of draft animals as one of the important tasks in rural areas. It calls for the immediate organization and mobilization of all forces to improve the feeding and management of draft animals in agricultural cooperatives, to store feed and repair sheds, and to establish and improve feeding and utilization systems, overcoming the phenomena of poor feeding and excessive use, leading to the weakness of draft animals, in order to prepare livestock power for this year's spring plowing and major production.
    The conference believes that the current phenomenon of small-sized livestock being cheap and unwanted is due to the fact that localities have not adequately resolved the issue of outlets for these livestock. Therefore, the conference requires all localities to immediately assist agricultural cooperatives in making comprehensive arrangements based on the needs of developing agricultural and sideline production. When necessary, small livestock can be handed over to cooperative members for shared feeding and shared use to meet the needs of cooperative member families. In some areas, the proportion of old and disabled cattle is too large, and they should be appropriately culled.
    After studying the breeding situation of draft animals in China in recent years, the conference believes that although the number of draft animals in China has increased from 59.77 million in 1949 to 87.56 million in 1956, with the realization of agricultural cooperation, the area of land under multiple cropping and the number of new agricultural tools being promoted are increasing, and the degree of intensive cultivation and the scope of management of sideline production are also being improved and expanded. Therefore, the attendance rate and demand for draft animals have greatly increased, and the current number of draft animals cannot meet the needs of agricultural production development. To this end, the conference requires all localities to strengthen draft animal breeding and livestock improvement work.
    The conference also studied and discussed the issues of draft animal allocation and prices, and put forward suggestions for improvement.
    This conference was convened by the Ministry of Agriculture on January 9th in Beijing, with the participation of 60 representatives from provinces, cities, and relevant departments of the Central Government.

    保护耕畜安全过冬　加强耕畜繁殖工作
    全国耕畜工作会议提出了要求和办法
    新华社讯　18日闭幕的全国耕畜工作会议，要求各地结合当前整社和冬季生产，把保护耕畜安全的度过冬春列为当前农村中的重要工作之一，立即组织和动员各方面的力量，改善农业社耕畜的饲养管理工作，贮备饲料和修补棚圈，建立和健全饲养、使役制度，克服饲养不善、使役过重、以致耕畜瘦弱的现象，为今年的春耕大生产做好畜力准备。
    会议认为，当前各地所存在的小个子牲畜价钱低、无人要的现象，是由于各地对这些牲畜的出路问题没有很好的解决。因此会议要求各地必须马上帮助农业社根据发展农、副业生产的需要，予以全面安排，必要时可将小牲畜交给社员伙养伙用，以满足社员家庭需要。有些地区老、残牛所占的比重过大，应予以适当淘汰。
    会议研究了几年来我国耕畜的增殖情况以后认为，虽然我国耕畜已由1949年的五千九百七十七万头发展到1956年的八千七百五十六万头，但是随着农业合作化的实现，土地复种面积和新式农具的推广数量正在增加，精耕细作的程度和副业生产的经营范围也在提高和扩大，因此耕畜出勤率及需要量大大增加，当前耕畜还不能满足农业生产发展的需要。为此，会议要求各地必须加强耕畜繁殖和畜种改良工作。
    会议对耕畜调剂和价格问题也作了研究和讨论，并且提出了改进的意见。
    这次会议是农业部1月9日在北京召开的，参加会议的有各省市和中央有关部门的代表六十人。
