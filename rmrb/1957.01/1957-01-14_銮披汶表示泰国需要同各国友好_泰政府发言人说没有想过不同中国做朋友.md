    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to Thai newspapers, Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram said at a press conference on the 4th that Thailand needs to be friends with all countries.
    When speaking to reporters about some issues in the current international situation, Phibunsongkhram believed that the international situation has developed in a better direction since the new year. He pointed out that whoever launches a war will be opposed and prevented. Under the current circumstances, Thailand can enhance friendship with all countries.
    When talking about the relationship with China, the Prime Minister still believed that it should be carefully considered. He said that immediately being friendly with China would be tantamount to separating Thailand from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the "free world." He reiterated that the Thai government must formally consider recognizing China's position after China officially enters the United Nations. He also said that Thailand's position on whether China should enter the United Nations will be based on the opinions of the majority of UN member states.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: According to a Thai newspaper report on January 8th, Thai government spokesman Khachon Sukkhaphiban said at a press conference on the 7th that Thailand has never been hostile to anyone, "Thailand has never thought about not being friends with Communist China." When talking about establishing normal diplomatic relations with China, he said that the current government's term is about to expire, and this issue will be decided by the new government formed after the general election.

    銮披汶表示泰国需要同各国友好
    泰政府发言人说没有想过不同中国做朋友
    据新华社讯　据泰国报纸报道，泰国总理銮披汶4日在记者招待会上说，泰国需要与各国为友。
    銮披汶就当前国际局势中的一些问题向记者发表谈话时认为，新年以来，国际局势又向好的方面发展了。他指出，谁发动战争，就会遭到反对和阻止。在目前情况下，泰国已经可以增进与一切国家的友谊。
    谈到同中国的关系问题时，这位总理仍然认为应该慎重加以考虑。他说，如果立即同中国交好，就等于要使泰国与东南亚条约组织和“自由世界”分离。他重申泰国政府必须在中国正式进入联合国以后才正式考虑承认中国的立场。他还说，至于泰国对中国是否应该进入联合国这个问题所采取的立场，要以联合国大多数会员国的意见为依据。
    据新华社13日讯　据泰国报纸1月8日报道，泰国政府发言人甲军冲在7日的记者招待会上说：泰国从来没有同谁敌对，“泰国从来就不曾想过不与共产党中国做朋友”。他在谈到同中国建立正常外交关系的问题时说，现政府的任期将届满，这个问题要待举行大选以后成立的新政府决定。
