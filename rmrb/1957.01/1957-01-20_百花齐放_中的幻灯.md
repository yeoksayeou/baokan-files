    Slideshows in "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom"
    Wu Guang
    After the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy for literature and art was put forward, many previously obscure opera genres were revived. Puppet shows, shadow plays... and so on have also gradually prospered. However, amidst this grand scene of a hundred flowers blooming and a riot of color, slideshows, which had begun to sprout three years ago, have gradually withered and become neglected. According to the Ministry of Culture's statistics in 1953, there were approximately 40,000 slide projectors nationwide. Over the years, many have broken or become damaged, and the 1956 statistics show only slightly more than 20,000 remaining. In many places, slide projectors have been shelved, covered in dust. Many cultural workers or members of the masses who used to show slideshows have not touched them for a long time. In 1953, in Shanghai alone, besides state-owned and local state-owned slide production organizations, there were more than 20 private production companies. Throughout the year, a total of more than 100,000 sets of slides were distributed nationwide. But in 1956, it is estimated that the total number of slides distributed by state-owned, local state-owned, and joint state-private slide production companies was only a little over 100,000 sets. Slideshows have not prospered in the sound of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom," but have instead declined. What is the reason for this?
    Some say: "Slideshows are backward things. As the film industry and other cultural undertakings develop, slideshows will be eliminated." Others say: "Slideshows don't count as a form of art. 'Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom' certainly doesn't extend to them." Is this really the case? Whether slideshows are a form of art and whether they will be eliminated with the development of the film industry and other cultural undertakings, we will not argue here for the moment. What needs to be raised is whether the masses like them and whether they can play a role in our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation.
    Although the overall situation of slideshow work has been declining in recent years, there are still some places that have been persisting in this work and have been loved by the masses. Xiyang County in Shanxi is one of them. This county already has 132 slide projectors, an average of one for every 1,200 people. The masses show them and watch them themselves, and sometimes even draw their own slides. Last year, during the wheat harvest, the club of an agricultural production cooperative created a set of slides called "Earn Two More Points, Lose Four Jin," based on the fact that some members were only concerned with earning more personal work points, harvesting hastily, and unwilling to glean wheat. They calculated the details and criticized this erroneous idea of valuing personal interests. After seeing these slides, the members were deeply educated and promptly reversed the phenomenon of leaving wheat behind.
    It's not just like this in the countryside. People in the cities also love to watch slideshows, especially children. During the "June 1st" Children's Day in 1956, the slide shows held for children at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace and Beihai Children's Home ran continuously for more than a dozen shows a day. Outside the screening room was always a long queue, and every show was packed. The Shenyang Cultural Center's screenings of slides such as "Preventing Gas Poisoning" were welcomed everywhere.
    The reason why slideshows have not been able to prosper is, of course, due to various reasons, but the main reason is that many people subjectively substitute their own preferences for the views of the masses. Some people have never even seen a slideshow, but they say that slideshows are dead, don't move, don't speak, and aren't worth watching. A cultural center in Hangzhou City encountered such a trade union cadre. The cultural center wanted to go to a factory to show slideshows and carry out slideshow activities, but this trade union cadre blocked them. Therefore, the cultural center had to first work on this cadre's thinking. Once, when the cultural center was showing slideshows in the street, they invited this trade union cadre to visit. After watching the slideshows, this cadre realized that slideshow screenings could be fast or slow, the content was easy to understand, and it was indeed a good tool for publicity, education, and cultural entertainment. After that, he took the initiative to invite the cultural center to screen the slides. Cultural centers like this that can persist in this work have been able to develop their work. However, in many places, because "slideshows" are not valued, no one cares whether this work is done well or badly, more or less, and gradually the slide projectors are put aside. There are also some places where cadres are full of enthusiasm, but when they encounter leaders who look down on slideshows, problems cannot be reported, and difficulties are not resolved, their enthusiasm gradually cools down.
    Because people don't have enough understanding of slideshows, there is a lack of due support for this work. In recent years, our writers, scientists, and various experts have rarely written scripts for slides, and painters have rarely drawn slides specifically for them. When the French youth delegation came to China this time, they brought slides to show to introduce the situation of French youth to Chinese youth. However, Chinese delegations going abroad rarely think of using slides. Many international friends ask us for slides of China's achievements in various aspects of construction, China's culture and art, China's customs and traditions, etc., but we either don't have them or have very few.
    Let's take a look at the situation abroad. The Moscow Slide Film Studio in the Soviet Union produces 800 kinds of slides (including reprints of old films) and copies more than 7 million sets every year. In factories and rural clubs, slides are often shown, and slides are often made to reflect production situations and promote work. In Hungary, more than 200 kinds of slides were produced in 1955, with more than 500,000 sets copied. In Japan, slideshows have a history of five years, and November 11th of each year is designated as "Slide Day." The slideshow industry in other people's democratic countries and capitalist countries is also very developed. The current situation in China, where only more than 100,000 sets of slides are issued each year, is not only incompatible with China's economic and cultural construction, but also very backward compared to the international situation.
    Slideshows are more vivid than comic strips, more flexible than movies, and have the characteristics of being economical, simple, and timely. Slideshows can be used to publicize current events and policies to the masses, popularize scientific and technological knowledge, spread advanced production experiences, and appropriately satisfy the cultural and entertainment lives of the masses. For the current situation in China's cities and rural areas, slideshows are completely necessary to develop and are also possible to develop.
    To require that slideshow work can be developed, everyone must recognize it and make full use of it. It is hoped that the cultural departments will put slideshow work in an appropriate position. It is hoped that cultural workers can widely promote it and care about it, and that writers, artists, scientists, and experts in various fields can write and create scripts for slideshows. This will promote slideshows to better serve socialist economic and cultural construction, and make this shrinking flower of slideshows bloom again.

    “百花齐放”中的幻灯
    吴光
    在“百花齐放”的文艺方针提出后，许多已经湮没的剧种，重新得到苏生。木偶、皮影……等等也都逐渐繁荣起来。但是在这百花齐放、万紫千红的盛况下，曾经在三年前开始萌芽的幻灯，却逐渐萎缩，逐渐冷落下去。1953年据文化部统计，全国约有幻灯机四万架。几年来破的破，坏的坏，1956年统计已只有两万多架了。许多地方的幻灯机已经被束之高阁，尘土满积。许多原来放映过幻灯的文化工作者或是群众，也已长久不摸幻灯了。1953年除国营和地方国营幻灯制片机构外，单上海一地就曾有过二十多家私营制片社。全年全国约共发行了幻灯片十多万套。但在1956年据估计，国营、地方国营和公私合营的幻灯制片社发行的总数也只有十多万套。幻灯没有在百花齐放声中繁荣起来，反而每况愈下，这是什么原因呢？
    有人说：“幻灯是落后的东西，电影事业和其他文化事业发展了，幻灯就要被淘汰。”也有人说：“幻灯算不上是一种文艺形式，百花齐放，当然也挨不到它头上来放。”事情是不是就是这样呢？幻灯是不是一种文艺形式，会不会随电影事业和其他文化事业的发展而被淘汰，我们姑不在这里争论。要提出的，是群众是不是喜爱它，在我国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造中它能不能起到作用。
    虽然几年来幻灯工作总的情况是消沉的，但也还有着一些地方，一直在坚持这项工作，而且受到了群众的热爱。山西昔阳县就是其中之一。这个县已经有一百三十二架幻灯机，平均每一千二百人中就有一架。群众自己放映自己看，有时还自己绘制幻灯片。去年麦收的时候，有一个农业生产合作社的俱乐部曾根据有些社员只顾多挣个人工分，草草收割，不愿拾麦穗的事实，绘成一套
  “多挣二分少收四斤”的幻灯片，算了一下细账，批判了这种重视个人利益的错误思想。社员看了这套幻灯片后，受到深刻教育，及时扭转了丢麦的现象。
    不仅在农村里是这样，城市里的人也同样爱看幻灯，尤其是儿童们。1956年“六一”儿童节在北京劳动人民文化宫和北海少年之家为儿童们举办的幻灯放映，一天连续放映十几场，放映室外一直是一字长蛇阵，场场满座。沈阳市的文化馆放映“防止煤气中毒”等幻灯片，到处受到欢迎。
    幻灯之所以没有能繁荣，当然有种种原因，但主要的却是有许多人主观地以自己的喜爱代替了群众的看法。有的人并没有看过幻灯，就说幻灯是死的，不会动，不会说话，没有看头。杭州市的一个文化馆就曾碰到过这样一个工会干部。文化馆想到一个工厂去放映幻灯，开展幻灯活动，这位工会干部给挡了驾，于是文化馆不得不先打通这个干部的思想。有一次文化馆在街道放映幻灯时，就邀请了这位工会干部去参观，这位干部在看过幻灯后才知道幻灯放映可快可慢，内容通俗易懂，确是一个宣传教育和文化娱乐的良好工具。之后，才主动邀请文化馆去放映。像这样的文化馆能坚持这一工作的，工作就开展了。但是许多地方因为“幻灯”不受人重视，这个工作做好做坏做多做少也没人过问，渐渐地就将幻灯机搁置起来了。还有些地方的干部虽然满腔热情，碰上领导上瞧不起幻灯，有问题反映不上去，有困难不给解决，热情也就渐渐地冷下来了。
    由于人们对幻灯没有足够的认识，对这一工作也就缺乏应有的支持。几年来，我们的作家、科学家和各种专家就很少为幻灯片写个稿本，画家们也很少专为幻灯画过片子。这次法国来我国的青年代表团，向我国青年介绍法国青年情况时就带了幻灯片来放映。我国出去的代表团却很少想到利用幻灯。许多国际朋友向我们要我国各方面建设成就、我国的文化艺术、我国的风土人情等等的幻灯片，我们不是没有就是很少有。
    再看看国外的情况吧，苏联的莫斯科幻灯制片厂每年要编制幻灯片八百种（包括复印旧片），拷贝七百多万套。在工厂、农村的俱乐部里，经常放映幻灯，经常自己制作幻灯片来反映生产情况，推进工作。在匈牙利，1955年制作了二百多种幻灯片，拷贝了五十多万套。在日本，幻灯已经有五年的历史，将每年的11月11日定为“幻灯日”。其他人民民主国家和资本主义国家的幻灯事业也都很发达。目前我国每年仅发行幻灯片十多万套的这种情况，不但同我国的经济和文化建设不相适应，同时在国际方面比较起来也是十分落后的。
    幻灯较连环图画生动，较电影灵活，并且具有经济、简便、及时等特点。可以通过幻灯向群众宣传时事政策，普及科学技术知识，传播先进生产经验，以及适当满足群众的文化娱乐生活。对我国目前城市、农村情况来说，幻灯是完全需要发展也有可能发展的。
    要求幻灯工作能够获得发展，就要求大家认识它，充分利用它。希望文化部门把幻灯工作放到适当的位置上来。希望文化工作者能广泛地推动它、关心它，希望作家们、美术家们、科学家们和各种工作的专家们，能为幻灯编写创作稿本。这样才能促使幻灯更好地为社会主义的经济和文化建设服务，使幻灯这朵在萎缩着的花重新盛开。
