Major Achievement in Laos Realizing Democratic Unification

The talks between the two sides in Laos on implementing the Geneva Accords and achieving peaceful unification have yielded significant achievements on the eve of the New Year. Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Royal Lao Government, and Prince Souphanouvong, representative of the Lao Fighting Units, signed a joint communiqué on December 29. The two sides decided to form a coalition government before holding supplementary general elections in order to begin establishing a unified nation and resolving other related issues.

The meeting between Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma and Prince Souphanouvong was a continuation and development of their highly successful talks held last August. In the previous talks, the two sides had reached principled agreement on major issues such as cessation of hostilities, holding supplementary general elections, establishing a coalition government, and pursuing a policy of peace and neutrality. Based on these agreements, the joint political and military commission composed of both sides has been working since last September and has achieved many positive results. The two sides have agreed that after the establishment of the coalition government, the Lao Fighting Units will become a political organization called the "Lao Patriotic Front" and will operate legally like other political parties. The administration and armies of the two provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly will be under the administration of the coalition government. The two sides have also reached specific agreements on measures to ensure that the Lao Fighting Units and former resistance personnel enjoy civil rights and participate in the power at all levels of the Kingdom. Regarding the issue of holding supplementary general elections, the two sides have agreed to stipulate in the forthcoming draft election law the principles of guaranteeing the democratic rights of all citizens.

Once implemented, these agreements reached by the two sides in Laos will effectively promote national unity in Laos, invigorate the people's democratic life, and enable all Lao people to work together to build a peaceful, democratic, unified, independent, and prosperous Laos. This bright prospect that lies before the Lao people clearly conforms to the greatest interests and national aspirations of all Lao people. At the same time, this is conducive to enhancing Laos' international status, further easing the situation in Indochina, and promoting peace in Asia and the world.

The continuous achievements of the two sides in Laos in the talks are the result of the joint efforts of the entire Lao people and the two sides in the talks. The Lao people have made many years of efforts and struggles to win national independence and strive for a peaceful and democratic life. In the past, due to the situation created by the colonialists, there were some misunderstandings and estrangement between the two sides in Laos. However, the facts since the signing of the Geneva Accords have proved that both sides in Laos share a common desire to strive for national independence and the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and both have the confidence to abide by and implement the Geneva Accords. Therefore, the atmosphere of mutual understanding and cooperation between the two sides has been developing in each round of talks. It is believed that the two sides in Laos will continue to work together in the future to implement the various agreements reached, further resolve other outstanding issues, and jointly strive to build a peaceful, democratic, unified, independent, and prosperous Laos.

In the successive talks between the two sides in Laos, the International Commission for Laos has provided effective assistance, and the people of all countries who are concerned about the implementation of the Geneva Accords and the maintenance of peace in Indochina have given enthusiastic support. However, it must also be noted that certain international forces, for their ulterior motives, are unwilling to see the full implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos and are unwilling to see Laos restore peace and unification. According to a report in the British "Foreign Affairs Bulletin" magazine on December 20, the U.S. and British ambassadors to Laos recently engaged in destructive interference and provocation regarding the establishment of a coalition government in Laos. They openly disregarded Laos' sovereignty and interests, opposed Laos' peaceful reunification, and rudely exerted pressure on Laos. Therefore, for the sake of Laos' national unity and the interests of Laos' democratic reunification, it is still necessary for the Lao people to continue to heighten their vigilance against foreign interference and provocation.

China and Laos are neighboring countries with a long history of friendly relations. The Chinese people hope to see the peaceful reunification of Laos and hope that Laos will become a democratic, free, prosperous, and happy country. Therefore, the Chinese people are deeply concerned about the peaceful settlement of the Lao issue in accordance with the Geneva Accords and express their heartfelt congratulations to the two sides in the Lao talks for the major achievements they have now made in realizing the peaceful reunification of Laos.

    老挝实现民主统一的重大成就
    老挝双方关于执行日内瓦协议，实现和平统一的会谈，在新年前夕取得了重大的成就。老挝王国政府首相梭发那·富马亲王和寮国战斗部队代表苏发努冯亲王12月29日签订了联合公报，双方决定在举行补充普选之前成立联合政府，以便着手建立统一的国家和解决其他有关问题。
    梭发那·富马首相和苏发努冯亲王这次举行的会议，是他们去年8月举行的具有显著成就的会谈的继续和发展。在前一次会谈中，双方已就停止敌对行动、举行补充普选、成立联合政府、奉行和平中立政策等重大问题，达成了原则性的一致协议。根据这些协议，双方组成的政治和军事联合委员会已从去年9月起开始工作，并取得了许多良好的结果。双方已经同意：在联合政府成立以后，寮国战斗部队将成为一个称为“老挝爱国战线”的政治组织，同其他政党一样合法地活动；桑怒和丰沙里两省的政权和军队，将属于联合政府的管理之下。双方对于保证寮国战斗部队和前抗战人员都享有公民权利和参加王国各级政权的措施，也已达成具体的协议。关于举行补充普选的问题，双方已经同意在即将起草的选举法中规定保障全体公民的民主权利的原则。
    老挝双方所达成的这些协议一旦实施，必将有效地促进老挝的民族团结，活跃人民的民主生活，从而使全体老挝人民能够为建设一个和平、民主、统一、独立和繁荣的老挝而共同努力。展现在老挝人民面前的这个光明前景，显然是符合全体老挝人民的最大利益和民族愿望的。同时，这也有利于老挝国际地位的提高，有利于进一步缓和印度支那局势，有利于亚洲和世界的和平。
    老挝双方在会谈中不断取得成就，是老挝全国人民和会谈双方共同努力的结果。老挝全国人民为了争取祖国的独立，争取过和平民主的生活，曾经进行了许多年的努力和斗争。过去由于殖民主义者所造成的形势，老挝双方之间曾存在一些互不了解和隔阂。但是，日内瓦协议签订以来的事实证明，老挝双方都有着争取民族独立与和平统一祖国的共同愿望，都有着遵守和实现日内瓦协议的信心。因此，双方之间互相了解和合作的气氛，在历次会谈中日见发展。人们相信，老挝双方今后必将继续携手合作，实现已达成的各项协议，并进一步解决其他尚待解决的问题，共同为建设一个和平、民主、统一、独立和繁荣的老挝而奋斗。
    在老挝双方的历次会谈中，老挝国际委员会曾作了有效的协助，关心日内瓦协议的实施和维护印度支那和平的各国人民都给了热情的支持。但是，也不能不注意到，某些国际势力为了它们的不可告人的目的，不愿意日内瓦协议在老挝全部实现，不愿意老挝恢复和平统一。据英国“外事报道”杂志12月20日透露，美国和英国驻老挝的大使，最近就曾对老挝成立联合政府的问题进行破坏性的干涉和挑拨。他们公然漠视老挝的主权和利益，反对老挝的和平统一，并粗暴地对老挝施加压力。因此，为了老挝的民族团结和老挝民主统一的利益，老挝人民对于外来的干涉和挑拨，还有必要继续提高警惕。
    我国和老挝是具有悠久的友好关系的邻国。我国人民希望看到老挝的和平统一，希望老挝成为一个民主、自由、繁荣、幸福的国家。因此，我国人民对老挝问题按照日内瓦协议和平解决，怀有深切的关心；对老挝会谈双方现在所取得的实现老挝和平统一的重大成就，表示衷心的祝贺。
