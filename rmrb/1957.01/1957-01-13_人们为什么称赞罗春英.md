Why People Praise Luo Chunying
By Our Correspondent Lei Pu

Qiu Shouzai, the director of the Jianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Shatun Township, Shunchang County, Fujian Province, introduced me to Luo Chunying in the rest room of the feeding group.

This was the second time I had seen Luo Chunying. The first time was in the pig farm of the feeding group. At that time, I was very envious of the achievements made by the young women here. Every one of the two hundred pigs was fat and strong; among them, four castrated pigs weighed more than four hundred catties each, with big heads and ears, looking like small elephants. Feeding pigs is generally considered the most filthy thing to do; however, their pig pens were washed so clean that there was very little dirty feces or urine to be seen. I was attracted by their ordinary deeds and couldn't help but linger for a while, and it was at that moment that I met her. She was a beautiful girl, wearing a well-fitting white feeder's uniform. A very ordinary feeder, why do people praise her? ×××

After the interview, I realized that people's praise for her was not without reason.

In 1954, the Jianfeng Cooperative newly raised more than twenty pigs. Because the cooperative needed people, female member Huang Baoying brought her fifteen-year-old child bride, Luo Chunying, to the cooperative to help her with cooking and preparing feed. When the east was dawning and everyone was still asleep, Luo Chunying followed her mother-in-law to the feeding group, cooking feed, feeding pigs, washing pig pens, picking pig feed, her two small hands constantly busy, until late at night, after the pigs fell asleep, they went to bed.

The clever Luo Chunying was able to gain the favor of her mother-in-law. However, she and her mother-in-law did not get along very well. Because her mother-in-law did not like the feeding group. Before she had worked for a few days, she said: the feeding group "eats all the feces and urine and smells enough stench, with no money to be made and only suffering." Soon the number of pigs in the cooperative increased by dozens, but some of the feeders were too lazy to be dragged, and no one cared when the pig feed ran out. The pigs stretched their necks and squealed, making Luo Chunying restless.

During those difficult days, her mother-in-law and two other female feeders quit the feeding group, and the entire feeding group seemed to be a heavy burden on the young Luo Chunying's shoulders. She silently endured all the difficulties, going out in the dark at four o'clock in the morning and not returning home until eleven o'clock at night. When feed was insufficient, she took two partners to the mountains more than ten miles away to pick wild vegetables. Excessive fatigue made her strong physique gradually thin down. Her mother-in-law felt sorry for her, scolded her for being a "born sufferer," and advised her to leave the feeding group, but she refused.

One day, the cooperative suddenly discovered swine fever, and several pigs died at once. Cold words poured into her ears like needles. The members said: The cooperative's money has nowhere to be sent, what can a yellow-haired girl manage. Her mother-in-law said to her: "Child, come back! If you continue to work, even my old bones won't be enough to compensate others, and your family doesn't lack your food and clothing." But she did not argue, she was still busy finding medicine and doctors for the pigs. Then even more unfortunate things happened, a sow that had given birth to piglets for just seven days died of the plague. It was the severe winter of December, and people were still shivering in cotton clothes. The three piglets left behind could neither eat nor run, huddled alone in the pig pen, three pairs of small eyes staring straight at people, like orphans, they would either freeze to death or starve to death. At that time, she couldn't help but cry, and silently made a plan in her careful heart. From that day on, she treated the piglets like a nanny treats toddlers. The piglets didn't know how to eat, so she held them in her arms and fed them spoonful by spoonful; at night when the weather was cold, she put the piglets in the house, padded them with grass and covered them with grass, and didn't leave until they fell asleep. It was in this way that she raised the three piglets day by day until they could walk and eat.

In June 1955, an old sow gave birth to eight piglets, which delighted Luo Chunying. However, after just one night, the eight piglets suddenly became six. She and her female companions looked around everywhere, but they couldn't find even a shadow of them. Luo Chunying was really worried. Her mother-in-law called her to eat, but she didn't go. Everyone else had gone to bed, but she didn't sleep either. Finally, she made up her mind and moved her bedding to the feeding group. From then on, she stayed in the pig pen day and night. She believed that if she did this, perhaps no more accidents would happen.

After a few days, her companions were cleaning the pig pen when the bodies of two dead piglets were dragged out from the cracks in the floor. It turned out that the piglets had fallen through the cracks in the floor.

Luo Chunying put all her energy into this feeding group. Her female companions said: Since she came to the feeding group, she has rarely been absent from work, unless she is sick, and she never refuses to work, and she is as united with her female companions as a family.

Luo Chunying was sold by her mother to the Huang family as a child bride when she was nine years old. This past has long formed a painful knot in her heart. Now, in the agricultural cooperative, in equal labor, this person who was forced by poverty and sold as cattle and horses in the old society has finally had her day. In the eyes of the members, Luo Chunying, although much younger than everyone else, is the most respected person, because she has done a good job in this career that some people look down on.

    人们为什么称赞罗春英
    本报记者　雷普
    福建省顺昌县沙墩乡建锋农业社主任丘寿斋介绍我去饲养组的休息室里会见了罗春英。
    我是第二次看到罗春英了。第一次看到她是在饲养组的养猪场里。那时候，我非常羡慕这里的年轻姑娘们已经做出的成绩。二百头猪不管挑出那一头来都是又肥又壮；其中有四头菜猪每头足有四百多斤，长得肥头大耳，真像几只小象一样。喂猪，在人们的印象中是最龌龊不过的事；可是，她们的猪栏却洗得光溜溜的，很少看到肮脏的粪尿痕迹。我被她们的这些平凡的事迹吸引住了，不由得多逗留了一会儿，就在这一刹那间认识了她。她是一个漂亮的姑娘，穿着一件合身的白色的饲养员工作服。一个平平常常的饲养员，人们为什么称赞她呢？			×××
    访问之后，我才知道人们对她的称赞并不是没有来由的。
    1954年，建锋社新养了二十多头猪，因为社里正需要人，女社员黄宝英就把刚满十五岁的童养媳罗春英带到社里来，帮她烧火、煮饲料。当东方发亮大家还在熟睡的时候，罗春英就跟着婆婆到饲养组了，煮饲料、喂猪、洗猪栏、拣猪菜，两只小手忙个不停，一直到夜深人静，等到猪睡了她们才去睡觉。
    聪明的罗春英倒也能得到婆婆的喜欢。但是，她和婆婆却有些合不来。因为婆婆并不喜欢饲养组。还没有干几天，就说：饲养组是“吃尽粪尿嗅够臭，没有钱赚有罪受”。不久社里的猪又增加了几十头，但是饲养员们有些是懒得要人拖，猪菜吃光了也没有人管，猪挺起脖子吱吱叫，弄得罗春英坐卧不安。
    就在这些困难的日子里，婆婆和另外两个女饲养员退出了饲养组，整个饲养组像一副千斤的担子一样压在年轻的罗春英头上。她不声不响地忍受一切困难，早晨四点钟摸黑出门，晚上十一点钟才回家睡觉。遇到饲料不足的时候，就搭上两个伙伴到十几里以外的山上去拣野菜，过度的疲劳使她健壮的体格日渐瘦削下来。婆婆疼她，骂她“天生的受罪骨头”，劝她离开饲养组，可是被她拒绝了。
    有一天，社里突然发现了猪瘟，一下子死了好几头猪。风凉话像针刺一样灌进她的耳朵里。社员们说：社里的钱没有地方送了，黄毛丫头能管什么事。婆婆对她说：“孩子，回来吧！再干下去连我这老骨头卖了也赔不起人家，家里又不缺你的吃穿。”但是她并不分辩，她仍忙着为猪找药、找医生。接着更不幸的事情发生了，有一头生了小猪刚七天的母猪被瘟死了。那是12月的严冬，人们穿着棉衣还打颤，留下的三头小猪既不会吃又不会跑，孤零零地偎缩在猪栏里，三双小眼直盯人，像孤儿一样，冻不死也会饿死。当时，她忍不住哭了，小心眼里默默地作了打算。从那天起，她就像保姆对待幼儿一样，小猪不会吃，她就抱在自己怀里一匙一匙的喂；晚上天气冷，她就把小猪放到屋子里，垫上草盖上草，直等到它们睡了才走开。就是这样一天天地把三头小猪养得会走会吃。
    1955年6月，一头老母猪生下八头小猪，喜坏了罗春英。但是，刚刚过了一夜，八头小猪忽然变成六头了。她和女伴们四下里找，找来找去连个影儿都不见。可真把罗春英急坏了。婆婆叫她吃饭，她不去，别人都已睡觉了，她也不睡。最后，她下了决心，把自己的被盖搬到饲养组来。从此，她日夜不离猪栏。她认为：这样做，也许不再发生意外的事情。
    过了几天，伙伴们打扫猪栏，两头死小猪才被从地板缝里拖出来，原来这小猪是从地板缝掉下去的。
    罗春英把她全副精力都放在这个饲养组里。她的女伴们说：她到饲养组以后，很少误工，除非是生了病，做起活来从来不推辞，同女伴们团结的像一家人一样。
    罗春英九岁就被妈妈卖给黄家做童养媳。这个身世长久以来在她心中结成一个痛苦的疙瘩。现在，在农业合作社里，在平等的劳动里，这个在旧社会为穷困所迫、被人当牛马贩卖的人，才有了出头的日子。在社员心目中的罗春英，虽然年纪比大家小了许多，但却是大家最敬佩的人，因为她把这个为有些人所看不起的事业作得很好。（附图片）
