Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, January 3rd: The delegation of the National People's Congress of China and the delegation of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee left Bucharest at noon on the 2nd by special train for Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria.

    Peng Zhen, the head of the delegation, delivered a farewell speech at the station. He first thanked the leading comrades and working people of Romania for their enthusiastic help to the work of the delegation. He said that the visit had deepened our mutual understanding and strengthened the friendship between the people of the two countries. The delegation learned a lot of advanced experience in Romania, which will be of great benefit and help to China's socialist construction and all aspects of work.

He congratulated the continuous consolidation and development of the friendship and unity between the people of China and Romania. Head of delegation Peng Zhen said that we are very pleased and very happy to see Romania, such a strong socialist fortress, in the west of the socialist camp. We know that this is disliked by the imperialist aggressive groups and all the counter-revolutionary elements who want to restore capitalism in Romania. Peng Zhen emphasized, how can a socialist country be liked by the warmongering aggressive groups headed by the United States? The more the imperialists dislike it, the more we like it. Finally, he wished the Romanian People's Republic prosperity and the people happiness.

    The Vice-Chairman of the Presidium of the Romanian National Assembly, Mi Sadoveanu, delivered a speech, wishing the delegation a safe and smooth journey. He asked the delegation to bring the friendship of the Romanian people to the Chinese people. He wished the workers and peasants of China new achievements.
