    Everywhere is Filled with the Sincere Friendship Between China and the Soviet Union
    The Soviet People Warmly Welcome Premier Zhou's Visit
    Our Correspondent in Moscow, January 11th, Li He reports: The Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, after holding sincere and friendly talks with the Soviet government in Moscow for three days, will, according to the planned schedule, return to Moscow for further talks after visiting Poland and Hungary.

    The visit of the Chinese government delegation to the Soviet Union and the Sino-Soviet talks have aroused widespread attention and extreme joy among the Soviet people.

    In recent days, newspapers have been prominently featuring the activities of Premier Zhou and representatives of the delegation, successively publishing remarks praising Sino-Soviet friendship. These remarks reflect the sincere feelings of the Soviet people. The "Izvestia" editorial on January 8th stated: "To love the great friend and brother, the Chinese people, is the most precious emotion of every Soviet person."

    During these days, the Soviet people everywhere expressed their love for the Chinese people. Vorik, director of the Kiev "Precision Electrical Instrument" Factory, said: "All the staff and workers of our factory, like all the Soviet people, are delighted to learn that the fraternal Chinese delegation led by Premier Zhou Enlai is making a friendly visit to the Soviet Union; and are convinced that this trip will further strengthen the brotherly unity between the great peoples of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and will further strengthen the forces of peace and democracy throughout the world." Vorik described the friendly relations between this factory and the Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory over the years. Engineers from the Kiev factory participated in the construction design of the Harbin factory, applying the advanced experience of Soviet and foreign-made instruments to the design. Outstanding workers and technicians from the Kiev factory strived to dedicate everything they knew to the Chinese comrades who came from the Harbin factory as interns. The Kiev factory supplied the Harbin factory with technical drawings and sent technical personnel to Harbin to provide on-site assistance. The employees of the two factories still maintain correspondence to this day.

    The people of Baku have close feelings towards China because many Baku people work in China's petroleum industry departments, and many Chinese experts have visited Baku. Aslanov, foreman of the "Lenin Petroleum" No. 8 oil field, said: "We really envy the people of Moscow, they have seen the distinguished guests. The arrival of Chinese political figures in Moscow will further strengthen the ties between the two peoples."

    Workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals of the Georgian Republic are paying close attention to the activities of the Chinese government delegation's visit to the Soviet Union. Chumburidze, a lathe operator at the Tbilisi Stalin Locomotive and Carriage Repair Factory, believes that this event makes everyone happy, and he said: "May friendship last forever, flourish, and be consolidated." Muskhlishvili, Corresponding Academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic, said: "This is a manifestation of unbreakable friendship."

    The people of Riga recently enjoyed the performances of the Shanghai Peking Opera Theater. Deitz, the principal of Riga Sixth Middle School, once heard the Peking Opera Theater's congratulations to the residents of the Baltic Sea region. He believes that the visit of the Chinese government delegation to the Soviet Union is a great event for consolidating world peace. He wishes the great and free China prosperity!

    到处洋溢着中苏两国的真挚友谊
    苏联人民热烈欢迎周总理的访问
    本报莫斯科11日电　本报记者李何报道：以周恩来总理为首的中国政府代表团，在莫斯科和苏联政府进行了三天诚挚的、友好的会谈，然后按照预定的计划，将在访问波兰和匈牙利之后，再回到莫斯科继续会谈。
    中国政府代表团的访苏和中苏会谈，引起了苏联人民的广泛的重视和万分的高兴。
    这几天的报纸一直以显著地位刊载了周总理和代表团代表的活动，先后发表了颂扬中苏友谊的言论。这些言论反映了苏联人民的真挚的感情。“消息报”1月8日的社论说：“爱伟大的朋友和兄弟中国人民，是每个苏联人的最宝贵的感情”。
    在这些日子里，苏联人民到处倾吐了对中国人民的热爱。基辅“精密电气仪器”工厂厂长沃里克说：“我厂的全体职工，正像全体苏联人民一样，满怀高兴地知道了由总理周恩来同志率领的兄弟中国代表团到苏联作友好的访问；并且深信，此行将进一步加强苏联和中华人民共和国两国伟大的人民之间兄弟般的团结一致，将进一步加强全世界和平民主的力量。”沃里克叙述了这个工厂和哈尔滨电表仪器厂多年来的友好关系。基辅厂的工程师参加了哈尔滨厂的建设设计，把苏联和外国制造仪器的先进经验运用到设计中去。基辅厂的优秀工人和技术人员努力把自己所晓得的东西都献给哈尔滨厂来的中国实习同志。基辅厂供给了哈尔滨厂技术图纸，并且派技术人员到哈尔滨就地帮助。两厂的职工至今仍然保持着书信联系。
    巴库人对中国有密切的感情，因为许多巴库人在中国石油工业部门工作，不少中国专家参观过巴库。“列宁石油”第八采油场工长阿斯兰诺夫说：“我们真是羡慕莫斯科人，他们看到了贵宾。中国政治活动家来到莫斯科，将进一步加强两国人民的联系。”
    格鲁吉亚共和国工人、集体农民、知识分子非常注意中国政府代表团访问苏联的活动。梯比里斯斯大林机车和车厢修理厂旋工楚木布里则认为，这件事使大家都高兴，他说：“愿友谊永存、繁荣和巩固。”共和国科学院通讯院士木斯赫里什维里说：“这是友谊牢不可破的表现。”
    里加人不久前欣赏了上海京剧院的表演。里加第六中学校长德依次曾听到京剧院对波罗的海居民的祝贺。他认为中国政府代表团访苏，是巩固世界和平的伟大事件。他祝伟大的和自由的中国繁荣！
