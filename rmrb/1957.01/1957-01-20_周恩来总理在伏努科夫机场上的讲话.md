Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at Vnukovo Airport

Dear Comrade Bulganin, dear Comrade Khrushchev, dear comrades and friends:

The friendly visit of the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China to the Soviet Union has come to an end. In a few minutes, we will leave Moscow, the capital of the great Soviet Union. Please allow me, in my own name and on behalf of my colleagues, to bid farewell to everyone.

We came with the desire to strengthen the friendship between China and the Soviet Union and the unity among socialist countries. During our talks with the Soviet leaders, we conducted extensive studies on many issues related to the international situation and bilateral relations, and reached unanimous agreement. The joint statement we signed today embodies these unanimous opinions.

While visiting the Soviet Union, we also had contact and talks with the leading comrades of the German Democratic Republic and the Hungarian People's Republic, and also visited Poland and Hungary. The joint communiques and statements of China-Germany, China-Soviet Union-Hungary, China-Poland, and China-Hungary, which were published as a result of these talks, demonstrate that the unity among the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is constantly developing and consolidating.

We Chinese people fully understand the great significance of this unity. For us, the unity of the 800 million Soviet people and the Chinese people, and the unity of the 900 million people of socialist countries, is the guarantee of the victory of the socialist cause and the guarantee of maintaining world peace. We would like to declare once again here that the unity of our socialist countries is unbreakable, and the Chinese people are determined to do everything possible to safeguard and strengthen this great unity.

At this moment of parting, I would also like to thank the Soviet people for the brotherly feelings they have shown us. The warm reception you have given us has once again made us deeply feel the warmth of the socialist family. In the past few days, we have visited your factories and schools, and we have seen that since my last visit in the summer of 1954, you have achieved many great achievements in economic and cultural construction. These achievements are a great encouragement to the Chinese people who are engaged in socialist construction.

I wish the people of the world's first socialist country—the great Soviet Union—greater achievements in the cause of building communism.

Long live the great and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people!

Long live the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live socialism!

Long live peace!

    周恩来总理在伏努科夫机场上的讲话亲爱的布尔加宁同志，亲爱的赫鲁晓夫同志，亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    中华人民共和国政府代表团在苏联的友好访问已经结束了。几分钟以后，我们就要离开伟大的苏联的首都——莫斯科了。请允许我以我个人的名义并代表我的同事们向大家告别。
    我们是抱着加强中苏友谊和社会主义国家之间的团结的愿望来的。在我们和苏联领导人进行的会谈中，我们曾经对有关国际局势和两国关系的许多问题进行了广泛的研究，并且取得了一致的意见。我们双方在今天签署的联合声明中，体现了这些一致意见。
    我们在访问苏联的同时，还同德意志民主共和国和匈牙利人民共和国的领导同志进行了接触和会谈，还访问了波兰和匈牙利。作为这些会谈的结果而发表的中德、中苏匈、中波、中匈联合公报和声明，表明了以苏联为首的各社会主义国家之间的团结是在不断地发展和巩固。
    我们中国人民充分理解这种团结的重大意义。对于我们说来，八万万苏联人民和中国人民的团结、九万万社会主义国家人民的团结就是社会主义事业胜利的保证，就是维护世界和平的保证。我们愿意在这里再一次宣告，我们社会主义国家的团结是牢不可破的，中国人民决心尽一切力量来维护并且加强这种伟大的团结。
    在这临别之际，我还要感谢苏联人民对我们所表现的亲如手足的感情。你们所给予我们的热忱接待使我们又一次深切地体会到社会主义大家庭的温暖。在过去的几天中，我们曾参观了你们的工厂和学校，我们看到，自从1954年夏天我上一次的访问以来，你们在经济和文化的建设方面又已经获得了许多伟大的成就。这些成就对于正在从事社会主义建设的中国人民是一种很大的鼓舞。
    我祝世界上第一个社会主义国家——伟大的苏联——的人民在建设共产主义的事业中取得更大的成就。
    中苏两国人民伟大的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的各社会主义国家的团结万岁！
    社会主义万岁！
    和平万岁！
