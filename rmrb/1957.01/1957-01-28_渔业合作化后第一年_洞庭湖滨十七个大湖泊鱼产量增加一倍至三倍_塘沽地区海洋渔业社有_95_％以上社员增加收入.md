Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 27th – Fishermen in the Dongting Lake area of Hunan Province achieved a bumper harvest in the first year after cooperativization in 1956. Among the twenty-three major lakes already open in the eight counties around the lake, the fish production of seventeen lakes increased by two to three times compared to 1955. Linxiang County only produced 2.25 million jin of fish in 1955, but reached 3.4 million jin in 1956. Most fishery cooperatives exceeded their production plans for December 1956.

According to cadres from the aquatic products department, the main reason for the bumper fish harvest in Dongting Lake in 1956 was the collective management advantages brought about by the advanced cooperativization of fishermen. The government also strengthened the lake management system and helped fishermen prepare for the opening of the fishing season. Aquatic product companies in various counties set up purchasing groups in various fish production areas to ensure that fishing, purchasing, and transportation were carried out simultaneously, saving the fishery cooperatives labor in transporting fish and increasing production time. During the opening of the fishing season, Party organizations in each county sent relevant responsible cadres to delve into the fishery cooperatives to lead production, share hardships with the fishermen, and greatly enhance the fishermen's enthusiasm for production.

Currently, fishing production in various counties is still proceeding intensely. Production teams within each fishery cooperative and between different production teams and boats have launched a labor competition to seize the red flag. Each fishing boat can catch more than 300 jin of fish per day. The sideline production brigade of the Dingjiawan Agricultural Cooperative in Changde County has earned more than 8,000 yuan since the opening of the fishing season.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 27th – The income distribution work of the marine fishery production cooperatives in the Tanggu area has concluded. The income of over 95% of the members has increased compared to the previous year.

Last spring, fourteen advanced fishery production cooperatives were established in the Tanggu area, with over 3,400 fishing households, accounting for 99.53% of the fishermen in the entire area, joining the cooperatives. After achieving advanced cooperativization, fishing boats were concentrated for use. Before the arrival of fish and shrimp shoals, scout boats were sent out to ascertain the fishing ground situation. After the fishing boats went out to sea, transport boats were used to transport the caught fish and shrimp and the nets and food needed on the fishing boats, reducing the round trip time for the fishing boats. Therefore, despite the poor harvest of sea fish last year, the total fishery output value for the year still reached more than 3.8 million yuan, an increase of more than 20% compared to the previous year. Among them, more than 5.3 million jin of prawns were caught, exceeding the original plan by more than 40%, achieving a bumper prawn harvest that had not been seen for many years.

With the increase in fishery production, coupled with the implementation of the principle of diligence and thrift in running the cooperatives, the income of the members increased. In 1955, each laborer earned an average of 620 yuan, while last year they earned more than 700 yuan. Wu Xifu, a member of the Tuanjie Fishery Production Cooperative in Dagu Town, used to earn only 300 yuan a year when he worked independently, but his income more than doubled last year.

    渔业合作化后第一年
    洞庭湖滨十七个大湖泊鱼产量增加一倍至三倍
    塘沽地区海洋渔业社有95％以上社员增加收入
    新华社长沙27日电　湖南省洞庭湖区渔民1956年合作化以后第一年获得了丰收。滨湖八个县已经开放的二十三个大湖泊中，有十七个鱼产量比1955年增加一倍到三倍。临湘县1955年只产鱼两百二十五万斤，1956年达到了三百四十万斤。大部分渔业社都超额完成了1956年12月份的生产计划。
    据水产部门的干部说，1956年洞庭湖鱼产丰收的主要原因，是渔民高级合作化以后发挥了集体经营的优越性。政府还加强湖场的蓄禁管理制度，帮助渔民做好开湖前的准备工作。各县水产公司在各埠鱼产区设有收购小组，做到边捕、边收、边运销，使渔业社节省运鱼的劳动力，增加了生产时间。在开湖期间，各县中共党组织都派有关负责干部深入渔业社领导生产，和渔民同甘共苦，使渔民生产积极性大大提高。
    现在各县捕鱼生产还在紧张进行。各渔业社的生产队和生产队、船和船之间开展了抢夺红旗的劳动竞赛。每只渔船每天可以捕鱼三百多斤。常德县丁家垸农业社的副业大队，从开湖到现在已经收入八千多元。
    新华社天津27日电　塘沽地区各海洋渔业生产合作社的收入分配工作已经结束。95％以上社员的收入都比前年增加。
    去年春季，塘沽地区组成了十四个高级渔业生产合作社，占全区渔民99.53％的三千四百多户渔民入了社。在实现高级合作化以后，捕鱼船只集中起来使用。在鱼、虾群到来之前，派出哨船去摸清渔场情况，在捕捞船出海后，由运输船运输捕到的鱼虾和捕捞船上需用的网具和食物，减少捕捞船的往返时间。因此，去年在海鱼欠收的情况下，全年渔业总产值还是达到三百八十多万元，比前年增加20％以上。其中捕捞的对虾共有五百三十多万斤，超过原定计划40％以上，获得了多年来没有过的对虾大丰收。
    随着渔业增产，加上各合作社贯彻执行了勤俭办社的方针，使社员的收入有了增加。1955年每个劳动力平均分得六百二十元，去年分得了七百元以上。大沽镇团结渔业生产合作社社员吴锡福过去在单干时，一年只能收入三百多元，去年收入就增加了一倍多。
