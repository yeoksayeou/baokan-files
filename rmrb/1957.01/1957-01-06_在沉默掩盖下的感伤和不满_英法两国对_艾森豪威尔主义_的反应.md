Under the Silence, the Underlying Sentiments and Dissatisfaction
— Reactions of Britain and France to the “Eisenhower Doctrine”
Yuan Xianlu

This time, Washington seems particularly affectionate towards its partners in London and Paris. On December 28, 1956, the day before the "United Press" revealed that the White House was preparing to implement the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Middle East, Dulles summoned British Ambassador Harold Caccia and French Ambassador Hervé Alphand to inform them of America's plan. By January 2, this year, the "United Press" explained with some ingratiating intent: Dulles did not reveal this matter to "any other country's diplomatic mission" before summoning the British and French ambassadors, which shows that he had "restored the trilateral consultations on Near East affairs."

However, London and Paris seem very cold to Washington's affection. Although the British and French governments made some welcoming gestures to the "Eisenhower Doctrine" bearing the anti-communist banner, this was only to cover up their crimes of invading Egypt! The "Associated Press" reported on December 30 last year: "The reaction of Whitehall officials was quite good. … Supporters of Prime Minister Eden believe that the American action proves that the British government has long been justified in its concern about Soviet infiltration into the Middle East." A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said: "We welcome the American proposals with satisfaction, and we are pleased that these proposals take into account the current threats in the Middle East." As for the key points of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" that Washington deliberately revealed, the governments of these two countries have remained silent. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office even denied that the United States had resumed consultations with Britain on the Middle East issue. He complained: Dulles only told the British ambassador to the United States "a little information about the US government's intention to request Congress to grant powers."

What is hidden beneath this cold silence? People can see the unspoken thoughts of government officials from the opinions of many bourgeois newspapers in Britain and France.

Is the "Eisenhower Doctrine," wielding weapons in one hand and gold coins in the other, really, as Washington's senior officials say, intended to "install a protective shield with American power to protect the Middle East from the threat of communism"? British and French politicians are old hands at political intrigue, and of course, they will not seriously believe Washington's nonsense. The London "Times" wrote: In the Middle East region, "the primary problem is not communism or Russian pressure, but their impact on nationalist sentiment." To put it more clearly, the Soviet Union did not threaten the people of the Middle East, but only supported the demands of the people of the Middle East for national independence. Then, who is the United States yelling "if necessary, the Middle East is worth fighting for" meant to scare? The "Sunday Times" diplomatic observer Carole hinted that this is primarily aimed at the people of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan who bravely defend their independence.

People will not forget that not long ago, Nixon and Dulles also tried to portray the United States as an anti-colonial fighter; now, the "Eisenhower Doctrine" automatically strips away this disguise, revealing the hideous face of neo-colonialism. The "Times" sarcastically wrote about the US president's request to Congress to grant "standby powers" to use force in the Middle East: "Such an action would completely change the government's new policy of leaving everything to the United Nations and deny all the moral clichés that Vice President Nixon and Dulles have been spouting. In addition, the implied threat to use force is an extremely ridiculous commentary on the strict measures taken by Washington to crush the military actions of Britain and France."

Of course, the reason why the bourgeois newspapers of Britain and France want to expose the United States' neo-colonial policy in the Middle East is by no means because they have any concern or sympathy for the national liberation movement in the Middle East, but because they feel somewhat pained by the United States' practice of squeezing out Britain and France. The Washington correspondent for the British "Observer" newspaper, O'Donovan, pointed out that the United States believes that "France and Britain have lost their past influence and prestige in this region," and therefore, "the new American steps are a conscious attempt to fill the vacuum formed by the disappearance of the old forces." The French "Le Monde" also published a commentary saying that the United States is attempting to use the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to further obtain "political and ideological benefits" in the Middle East and to replace the waning influence of Britain and France with the influence of the American government. The British "Daily Telegraph" also used a rhetorical question to negate Washington's claim that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is to guarantee the interests of the entire West. It wrote: "Why was this not announced when the three countries could have done so consistently?"

Therefore, the bourgeois newspapers of Britain and France complained with dissatisfaction about Washington, this ill-intentioned ally. The "Times" said in an editorial: A "sense of balance must be maintained" in the Middle East. "It is unrealistic to think that British interests can be completely taken care of by the United States or the United Nations. British and American interests are different in many respects." "Agence France-Presse" reported on the views of some observers in London, saying: "Despite the Suez crisis, Britain still maintains enough power in the Middle East to make it worthwhile for the (American) State Department to consider adjusting the policies of the two countries." The French "Volonté," which has close ties with the Mollet government, said: The "Eisenhower Doctrine" has aroused much criticism around the world even before its outline has been officially known. "Combat" wrote: "It is certain that President Eisenhower does not expect to receive unanimous agreement," "but it seems he underestimated the widespread reservations and objections that his plan could provoke."

So, what are the British and French governments going to do? They are silent. This is not because they still do not see what this American approach means to them, but because the failure of the invasion of Egypt has made them eat their own bitter fruit, so that they are more economically and politically dependent on the United States. The "Wall Street Journal" correspondent in London, Philip Geyelin, wrote on December 17 last year without any disguise: British foreign policy makers have concluded that Britain "must hold tightly to Uncle Sam's coattails"; then he added: This sentence "applies equally to France." An article in the first issue of the American "Foreign Affairs" in 1957 further pointed out: "This kind of thing is certainly extremely uncomfortable for many people in London and Paris." But, "He who pays the piper calls the tune." Because of this, although the British and French governments have endless sentiments and profound dissatisfaction with the "Eisenhower Doctrine," they can only remain silent like "a mute eating coptis chinensis—unable to express the bitterness."

Silence, after all, cannot resolve the contradiction of interests. In any case, London and Paris will not be willing to let Washington use the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to squeeze them out of the Middle East. The cracks on the Atlantic wall were not repaired by Dulles's visit to Paris not long ago, but have now been deepened and widened by the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

Let the old colonialists in London and Paris argue with the new colonialists in Washington, whether they use open opposition or cold silence. The Middle East ultimately belongs to the people of the Middle East. The public opinion of many Middle Eastern countries such as Egypt, Syria, and Jordan has clearly stated that the Middle East is by no means a "vacuum zone" and does not need countries from other regions to "fill." A person in Cairo put it well: "The Arabs drove the British and French out the door, not to let the Americans come in through the window." Whether it is old-fashioned colonialists or new-style colonialists, their attempts to enslave the people of the Middle East are unlikely to get any satisfactory results.

    在沉默掩盖下的感伤和不满
    ——英法两国对“艾森豪威尔主义”的反应
    袁先禄
    这一次，华盛顿似乎对伦敦和巴黎的伙伴们显得特别亲昵。1956年12月28日，在“合众社”透露白宫准备在中东推行“艾森豪威尔主义”的前一天，杜勒斯就召见了英国大使哈罗德·卡西亚和法国大使埃尔弗·阿尔芳，把美国的这个打算告诉了他们。到今年1月2日，“合众社”又带着几分卖好的意思解释说：杜勒斯在召见英、法两国大使之前没有把这件事透露给“任何别的国家的外交代表团”，足见他已经“就近东事务恢复了三国磋商”。
    但是，伦敦和巴黎对华盛顿的这种亲昵却显得很冷淡。虽然，英、法两国政府对“艾森豪威尔主义”打着反共招牌这一点作了一些欢迎的姿态，而这也不过是为了给自己侵略埃及的罪行来遮羞罢了！“美联社”在去年12月30日报道说：“白厅官方人士的反应相当良好。……艾登首相的支持者认为美国的行动证明英国政府长期以来对苏联渗入中东的担心是有道理的。”法国外交部发言人说：“我们以欣慰的心情欢迎美国的建议，我们高兴的是，这些建议考虑到了目前中东所存在的威胁。”至于对华盛顿故意透露出来的“艾森豪威尔主义”的要点本身，这两个国家的政府都保持沉默的态度。英国外交部发言人甚至否认美国已经就中东问题同英国恢复磋商的说法。他不无埋怨地说：杜勒斯只不过告诉了英国驻美大使“一点关于美国政府想要求国会授予权力的打算的情报”。
    在这冷淡的沉默下面隐藏着什么呢？人们可以从英国和法国的很多资产阶级报纸的舆论里看到政府官员所没有说出来的心里话。
    一手拿着武器、一手拿着金元的“艾森豪威尔主义”，难道真如华盛顿的高级官员所说的那样，是为了“以美国的力量给受到共产主义威胁的中东安上一面保护的盾牌”吗？英国和法国的政客们自己就是玩弄政治阴谋的老手，当然不会认真地相信华盛顿的这种鬼话。伦敦“泰晤士报”写道：在中东地区，“首要的问题不是共产主义或俄国的压力，而是它们对民族主义情绪的影响”。话再说得明白一点，苏联并没有威胁中东人民，而只是支持了中东人民争取民族独立的要求。那末，美国叫嚷“如果必要，中东是值得为之一战的”，是为了吓唬谁呢？“星期日泰晤士报”外交观察家卡罗尔暗示说：这首先是针对英勇保卫自己独立的埃及、叙利亚和约旦人民的。
    人们不会忘记，就在不久以前，尼克松和杜勒斯还企图把美国打扮成一个反殖民主义的战士；现在，“艾森豪威尔主义”就自动把这种伪装剥开了，而露出一副新殖民主义的狰狞面目。“泰晤士报”就美国总统要求国会授予在中东使用武力的“备用权”这件事讽刺地写道：“这样一种行动将完全改变政府所采取的把所有事情都交由联合国解决的新政策，否认尼克松副总统和杜勒斯所弹的一切道德滥调。此外，其中所暗含的使用武力的威胁，几乎是对华盛顿为了粉碎英法两国的军事行动而采取的严厉措施的极其可笑的注释。”
    当然，英、法两国的资产阶级报刊所以要戳穿美国在中东的新殖民主义的政策，决不是因为它们对中东的民族解放运动有着什么关怀和同情，而是因为美国这种排挤英、法的做法，多少感到有些痛心。英国“观察家报”驻华盛顿记者奥多诺文指出，美国认为“法国和英国在这个地区已经丧失了它们过去的势力和威信”，因而，“美国新步骤就是自觉地企图填补由于旧势力的消失而形成的真空”。法国“世界报”也发表评论说：美国企图利用“艾森豪威尔主义”来进一步在中东取得“政治上和思想上的利益”，并且以美国政府的影响来代替英法丧失中的影响。英国的“每日电讯报”又用反问来否定华盛顿关于“艾森豪威尔主义”是为了保证整个西方利益的说法。它写道：“在三国本来可以一致这样做的时候，为什么反而没有宣布这一点呢？”
    因此，英法两国的资产阶级报纸就纷纷带着不满的心情埋怨华盛顿这个不怀好意的盟友。“泰晤士报”在一篇社论里说：在中东“必须保持平衡感”。“认为英国的利益能够完全由美国或联合国来照管，这是不现实的。英国和美国的利益在很多方面是不一样的”。“法新社”报道伦敦一些观察家的看法说：“尽管有苏伊士危机，英国在中东仍然保有足够的势力，使得（美国）国务院值得去考虑调整两国的政策。”同摩勒政府有密切联系的法国“义勇军报”说：“艾森豪威尔主义”甚至在大家没有正式知道它的大纲之前就引起了全世界的纷纷批评。“战斗报”写道：“肯定地说艾森豪威尔总统并不指望会得到一致的同意”，“但是看来他低估了他的计划所能招致的广泛的保留和反对意见”。
    那末，英、法两国政府准备怎么办呢？它们沉默着。这倒并不是因为它们到现在还看不出美国这种做法对它们意味着什么，而是因为侵埃战争的失败已经使它们自食恶果，以致在经济上和政治上更加需要依赖美国了。美国“华尔街日报”驻伦敦记者菲利普·盖耶林在去年12月17日就毫不掩饰地写道：英国的外交决策者已经得出结论，英国“必须紧紧地扯住山姆大叔的衣服下摆”；接着他又补充说：这句话“同样适用于法国”。美国“外交季刊”在1957年第一期的一篇文章里进一步指出：“这种事情当然是使伦敦和巴黎许多人感到极不舒服的”。但是，“谁给钱吹笛子，谁就有权决定吹什么或者不吹什么”。正因为这样，尽管英、法两国政府对于“艾森豪威尔主义”有着无限的感伤和深刻的不满，但是只好“哑子吃黄连，有苦说不出”地沉默着。
    沉默，毕竟不能解决利害的矛盾。无论如何，伦敦和巴黎是不会甘心让华盛顿用“艾森豪威尔主义”把它们从中东排挤出去的。大西洋之墙上的裂痕，不久前杜勒斯到巴黎去没有补好，而现在由于“艾森豪威尔主义”而又加深和扩大了。
    让伦敦和巴黎的老殖民主义者同华盛顿的新殖民主义者去争吵吧，无论他们是用公然的反对或者是冷淡的沉默。中东终究是属于中东人民的。埃及、叙利亚和约旦等很多中东国家的舆论已经明确地表示：中东决不是什么“真空地带”，不需要其它地区的国家来“填补”。开罗一位人士说得好：“阿拉伯人把英法赶到门外，并不是为了让美国人从窗户进来。”老牌殖民主义者也好，新型殖民主义者也好，他们企图奴役中东人民的阴谋都不可能得到什么如意的结果。
