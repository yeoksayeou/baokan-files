    The One Who Braves Thorns
    By our reporters Xi Ping and Ji Yin

    "A Wasteland"
    In a narrow, unremarkable alley in Shanghai's Tilanqiao district, there was a small factory called "Yongda Cotton Ginning Factory." The entire factory consisted of only a few dilapidated buildings, thirty-eight workers, and four old cotton gins. Last spring, this factory, along with factories across Shanghai, was approved to implement joint state-private ownership.

    It was in the scorching July of last year. In the afternoon, a young man hurried to this factory. He was Guo Mingchang, who had been assigned to this newly joint state-private factory as the public-sector deputy director. Guo Mingchang was originally a worker at the Nanhua Underwear Factory and later served as the chairman of the factory's trade union. This time, he was transferred here to serve as the public representative. The new and complex task made this twenty-five-year-old young man feel somewhat nervous. Before coming to the factory, he ran around, asking comrades from relevant units to learn about "Yongda's" situation. Therefore, before arriving here, he had a general idea: this was a factory with fairly backward work, the factory's production was seriously losing money, the private-sector personnel were not very motivated in management, there was not a single Communist Party member in the factory, nor any Communist Youth League organization, the trade union was divided… In short, he was about to step into a wasteland waiting for him to brave thorns and cut through brambles.

    When he arrived at the factory on his first day, he discovered that the situation was far worse than he had imagined. The factory had changed its production task from June, specializing in ginning pig bristles. As soon as he stepped into the factory gate, a stench hit him in the face, and he couldn't help but cover his nose. Walking inside, he saw that what was in front of him was not a factory at all, but a large garbage pit. In the small courtyard, there was a thick layer of pig manure, and his shoes sank into it when he stepped on it. The eaves were buzzing, and when he looked up, it was all black with golden-headed flies. Walking to the door of the workshop, an even stronger stench rushed out of the room. He looked inside and saw a yellowish haze, with pig bristles and pig feces flying all over the room, obscuring the view. Guo Mingchang walked all the way inside before he could barely see a few workers working. They were covered in pig bristles, only revealing two bright eyes, constantly sizing up this new public representative. This terrible image frightened Guo Mingchang. He went to see the warehouse, where the water from the courtyard had flooded into the warehouse, and the bottom layer of sacks was soaked in water and mildewed. Piles of maggots growing out of the pig bristles wriggled on the ground, and a foul smell filled the entire room. Walking into the kitchen, no, this was not a kitchen, but another garbage pit. Many leftover steamed buns and cold rice were discarded in the jar, emitting a moldy, sour smell…

    The workers told the public representative many things about the factory's poor working conditions, such as the air in the workshop was too bad, and many workers couldn't eat and fell ill. The workers were covered in pig bristles and stench when they got off work, and there were no bathhouses in the factory. They went to the public bathhouse to wash, but they were not allowed because they were too smelly. There was no canteen in the factory, and the workers had to hold the cold rice they brought from home every day and squat at the entrance of the workshop or in the aisle to eat. The factory's wages were often not paid, with delays and arrears… Demands and problems were piled up in front of the young public representative.

    From Wavering to Firm

    For several nights, Guo Mingchang returned home with a body full of stench. The series of terrible scenes in the factory made his heart tremble. Would he have to stay in this factory for a long time in the future? Could his body withstand it? Waves were stirred in his mind. Advertisements for admissions to secondary technical schools in the city were published in the newspaper, which had been his long-held wish. Should he leave this "garbage pit" and apply to the school? But when he walked into the factory early the next morning and saw everything in front of him, his plan wavered again. He said to himself: He can't leave! He was the first Communist Party member to come to this factory. The Party sent him here as a seed, to make him blossom and bear fruit here. He remembered the afternoon of his first day at the factory, when the workers gathered at the gate to warmly welcome him, setting off firecrackers. Halfway through the welcome meeting, it started to rain heavily, and there was water in the courtyard and they couldn't walk. Several workers competed to carry him out on their backs… When he walked out of the factory barefoot, this touching scene kept flashing before his eyes.

    Braving Thorns

    The immediate task was to eliminate those maggots, stench, and flies… and let people truly live human lives.

    However, things were not simple. One day, Guo Mingchang said to several workers, "Pour out the dirty things in the kitchen jar." When he went to see it again the next day, the kitchen was still sour and pungent, and everything was as before. "You can't just stand by and talk, you have to do it yourself first." He said to himself. Rolling up his sleeves, putting on a mask, he cleaned up by himself, pouring out the stale rice and sewage in the water tank, and cleaning it up and down. Just then, a worker bumped in and, seeing this, ran out and shouted, "Go and see, if we don't do it, the public representative is doing the work of a 'niangyi' (maid) for us!" From that day on, no one went to pour out leftover food in the kitchen. Things had a good start.

    One early morning, the factory was quiet, and Guo Mingchang and three trade union comrades appeared in the courtyard. "Let's start working first," Guo Mingchang said. They started to dig out the maggots from the workshop and around the courtyard, concentrated them in one place, and burned them to death with lime. They also sprinkled lime and "666" insecticide powder on the dug-up areas, and sprayed DDT on the places where flies gathered. Later, more people participated, and the fifty-year-old private-sector deputy director also came to participate. The whole factory was in a state of intense and happy labor. After several major cleanings, maggots and flies were finally mostly eliminated. The workers then formulated their own rules: stipulating that each shift of workers must clean the area near the workshop before getting off work, and then hand it over to the next shift.

    There were still many things to be dealt with: the workshop's protective equipment, the workers' bathing and eating problems, these were all urgent demands of the workers. "The factory is still in trouble, and although the company has allocated a sum of money, it should not be spent too much. We must find the most economical way." Guo Mingchang went to discuss with the private-sector deputy director and decided to make the most of the existing things. An exhaust fan was installed in the workshop, and safety equipment was installed on the most dangerous parts of the cotton gin. A storage room was converted into a canteen, and some tables and benches were added. Another old room was turned into two male and female bathrooms, and a few wooden bathtubs were bought. Although these facilities were much simpler than those in large factories, the workers of the "Yongda" factory were very satisfied. When they worked in a workshop with much less odor and dust, when they took their first bath and walked out of the factory gate in clean clothes, when they sat down on the stool in the canteen for the first time and picked up hot food, how much gratitude filled their hearts!

    Through Wind and Rain

    One Sunday, Guo Mingchang went to the factory as usual to take a look. The factory was quiet, and most people had gone to rest. At this time, dense rain clouds surged in the sky, and after a while, a torrential downpour began. There was no drain in the courtyard, and the water rose suddenly. "Water is coming in, water is coming in," someone shouted anxiously from outside. Guo Mingchang remembered that there were many pig bristles piled up in the warehouse and workshop, and if they were flooded, they would breed insects and be damaged, so he rushed out the door. The heavy rain soaked him in a moment. He waved a shovel in the rain and dug a large pond to divert the water on the ground to the pond. He also built earth dams at the entrances of the workshop and warehouse. Several people who stayed at the factory saw this situation and rushed into the rain together. At this time, the rain had poured into the warehouse and workshop, and the situation was critical. They built dams while organizing the removal of water. It rained for more than three hours, and a few people fought in the rain for several hours. When they walked into the room after the rain stopped, everyone's face was like a white sheet of paper. But the warehouse and workshop were not damaged.

    The radio issued an emergency typhoon warning. The extremely tired Guo Mingchang began to arrange typhoon prevention work. The typhoon was a terrible enemy for "Yongda." Their houses were already dangerous factory buildings beyond their lifespan. If they were not well prepared, anything dangerous could happen. Because the people on duty could never be gathered, Guo Mingchang decided to participate in the night shift himself. For three consecutive days, he worked during the day and was on duty at night. Fatigue attacked his entire body, and he struggled out of drowsiness countless times.

    Late on the night of August 2, the typhoon and rain finally arrived together. The gale roared, and the sky was pitch black. Guo Mingchang and several workers on duty rushed into the rain again to inspect and rescue everywhere, and were drenched in the rain for several hours. The typhoon did not subside until dawn. Several workers rushed to the factory and said that the thatched houses of several workers had been damaged by the wind. As soon as Guo Mingchang heard this news, he invited a few people and rushed to the workers' residential area to visit them.

    At this time, the wind was still at level seven or eight, whistling. The road was still very unsafe. Trees, fences, and power lines were lying all over the ground. When the public representative and other comrades appeared in front of the workers' dormitories, many workers who were repairing their houses were stunned. The factory director had actually come to their thatched huts. This had never happened before. The losses from this typhoon were indeed not small. The bamboo fence wall of worker Luo Chunxi's home was blown down by the typhoon, and the roof of worker Li Jida's home was completely blown off. Guo Mingchang told Li Jida to stop working for a day and repair the roof at home. And he allocated some wood and straw to him. Other workers who suffered from the typhoon disaster were all given relief from the factory and overcame the difficulties.

    When Guo Mingchang was assigned work by the district committee's organization department, the responsible comrade of the district committee repeatedly told him before he left: "After you go to the factory, the most important thing is to maintain a hard-working and simple style, share weal and woe with the masses, and set an example. This is the most important condition for our Communist Party members to do a good job. Pay special attention to this when you go to a small factory…" From the day he went to the factory, Guo Mingchang was constantly using these words to awaken himself and demand himself. He was the first to rush into the torrential rain; he almost always came to the factory first every day, and he was almost always the last to turn off the lights in the office. He has almost visited all the workers' families in the entire factory, and has kept the suffering of each worker in his heart; he saw the workers wearing sacks as rain gear to rush to work, and helped the workers solve the problem of umbrellas; he saw that the workers had to run from the workshop to the outside to drink water, and added tea cups for the workers. Although these are all small things, how warm the workers' hearts should be.

    Blossoming and Bearing Fruit

    Profound changes have taken place in this small factory. Regardless of strong winds and heavy rains, regardless of the sweltering heat, the number of workers going to work is increasing day by day. In July last year, absenteeism reached 12%, while in September and October it suddenly dropped to only 2%. Early departures, late arrivals, absenteeism, and fighting have all disappeared.

    Based on the proposal of young worker Li Xisheng, the factory was changed to a three-shift system from September. The working hours were reduced from nine hours a day in the past to seven and a half hours, but the labor productivity increased linearly.

    The average output value per worker in June was 108 yuan, but by September it had increased to 236 yuan. The factory's loss-making situation has been completely reversed. The monthly work fee has increased from more than 4,000 yuan in the past to more than 9,000 yuan. The arrears of wages of more than 4,000 yuan before the joint state-private ownership were paid off. Workers can get their wages on time every month. The relationship with the bank has changed from past debt to regular deposits of several thousand yuan.

    One day, the director of the district committee's industry department ran to see Guo Mingchang. He had heard that Guo Mingchang was working in very harsh conditions at the Yongda factory and had lost eight pounds in weight in more than a month. He felt uneasy and ran to see him. When Guo Mingchang walked towards him, the director couldn't help but be startled. How could this young man be so thin? His eye sockets were sunken, surrounded by a circle of black. It seemed that overwork had worn him down.

    "Have you gotten used to factory life?"

    "I'm used to it. If the workers can get used to it, how can I not get used to it?" Guo Mingchang said happily. In fact, he was not only used to it, but had also deeply fallen in love with this factory and the workers. And the workers loved him so much.

    披荆斩棘的人

    “一片荒地”
    在上海提篮桥区一条狭小的没有什么名气的小马路上，有一个叫做“永大弹花厂”的小工厂。全厂只有几间破旧的房屋，三十八个工人和四部老旧的轧花机。去年春天，这座工厂和上海全行业的工厂一起，被批准实行公私合营。
    这是去年炎热的7月间。下午，一个青年人匆匆地来到了这座工厂。他就是被派到这座新公私合营工厂来担任公方副厂长的郭明昌。郭明昌原来是南华内衣厂的一个工人，后来担任了本厂工会主席。这次他被调到这里来担任公方代表，新的复杂的任务使这个二十五岁的青年人不免感到有些紧张。他在下厂以前，就四处奔跑，找一些有关单位的同志了解“永大”的情况，因此来到这里以前，他心里大体上已有了一个底：这是一个工作上相当落后的厂，厂的生产严重亏损，私方人员经营积极性不高，厂里没有一个共产党员，也没有青年团组织，工会闹不团结……总之，他即将跨进去的是等待他去披荆斩棘的一片荒地。
    当他第一天到了厂里以后，他才发现，情形的糟糕还远超出他的想像。原来工厂从6月份起已改变生产任务，专弹猪毛。他刚跨进厂门，一股臭味迎面扑来，禁不住捂住鼻子。走到里边一看，天哪，摆在他面前的那里是一座什么工厂，简直就是一个大垃圾坑。小小的天井里堆着厚厚的一大层猪屎浆，他的鞋子踏下去就陷在浆里。屋檐上“嗡嗡”响，他抬头一看，乌黑的一片全是金头苍蝇。走到车间门口，一股更强烈的臭味从屋子里冲出来，他往里望去，只见黄蒙蒙一片，满屋飞舞的猪毛猪粪，遮盖得看不见人影，郭明昌一直走到里边，才勉强看清了几个在工作着的工人，他们混身上下都沾满了猪毛，只露出两只乌溜溜的眼睛，不住地向这位新来的公方代表打量着。这可怕的形象使郭明昌简直吓了一跳。他又去看了仓库，天井里的水灌进仓库，底下的一层麻袋全浸在水里霉烂着，地上蠕动着一堆堆从猪毛里生长出来的蛆虫，恶臭充满全屋。走到厨房里，不，这不是厨房，而是又一个垃圾坑，缸里丢着许多吃剩的馒头、冷饭，发出发霉的酸臭，……。
    工人们向公方代表诉说了许多关于厂里劳动条件太差等等情况，譬如车间的空气太坏，许多工人都吃不下饭，病倒了。工人们下班时混身沾满猪毛和臭味，厂里没有洗澡间，跑到老虎灶去洗，因为太臭不给洗。厂里没有食堂，工人们每天只好捧着从家里带来的冷饭，蹲在车间门口或走道里吃。厂里工资经常发不出，又是拖，又是欠……要求和问题，几乎是成堆地向年青的公方代表面前推过来。
    从动摇到坚定
    几天晚上，郭明昌都带着一身臭气回到家里。厂里一连串可怕的景象使他的心头发颤。以后就要长期地在这个厂里呆下去了吗？身体能撑得住吗？他的思想上掀起了波澜。报上登着全市中等技术学校招生的广告，这是他很久以来的愿望，离开这个“垃圾坑”去投考学校吧！……但是当他第二天一早走进厂里，看到眼前的一切，他的打算又动摇了，他对自己说：不能离开！他是来到这个工厂的第一个共产党员，党是把他作为一粒种子播到这里来，要他在这里开花结果的。他想起了到厂的第一天下午，工人们聚集在门口热烈地欢迎他，“劈劈拍拍”的放着鞭炮。欢迎会开到一半，下起了大雨，院子里积着水不能走，好几个工人争着要背他出去，……当他赤着脚走出厂去的时候，这感人的情景一直在他的眼前闪动。
    披荆斩棘
    眼前的任务在于消除那些蛆虫、恶臭、苍蝇……，让人真正过人的生活。
    然而事情并不简单。有一天，郭明昌对几个工人说：“把厨房缸里的脏东西都倒掉吧。”第二天他再去看时，厨房里依然酸臭刺鼻，一切如旧。“不能仅仅站在边上讲，得自己先动手来做才行。”他对自己说。卷起袖子，带上口罩，他就独个儿打扫起来，倒掉了水缸里的馊饭、污水，上上下下弄个干净。正巧这时候，一个工人撞了进来，看到这情形，就跑出去嚷开了：“你们去看，我们不动手，公方代表在替我们做娘姨（即佣工）啦！”就打这天起，厨房里再没有人去倒剩饭菜了。事情有了很好的开始。
    一个清早，厂里静悄悄的，郭明昌和三个工会同志出现在院子里。“让我们先来动手干吧，”郭明昌说。他们就动手在车间和院子的四周，把蛆虫挖出来，集中在一处用石灰烧死。又在挖过的地方撒上石灰、“六六六”杀虫粉，在苍蝇聚集处喷射DDT。以后，参加的人多了，五十多岁的私方副厂长也赶来参加了。全厂一片紧张愉快的劳动。经过几次大扫除，蛆虫和苍蝇终于大部分绝迹了。工人们接着自己订出了制度：规定每班工人在下班前要把车间附近打扫干净，然后才移交给下一班。
    还有许多事情摆在面前要处理：车间的防护设备，工人的洗澡、吃饭问题，这些都是工人们迫切要求解决的。“工厂现在还困难，公司虽然拨下了一笔钱，但也不应花得过多，一定得找出一个最节省的办法来，郭明昌便去和私方副厂长商量，决定尽量利用旧有的东西来做。在车间里装了一个吸尘器，将轧花机上最危险的部分装上了安全设备。把一间储藏室改作食堂，添置了些桌凳。把另一间旧房间辟成两间男女浴室，买了几只木头浴盆。这些设施比起大工厂来虽然要简陋得多，但“永大”厂的工人们却很满意，当他们在臭气和尘埃大为减少的车间里工作的时候，当他们第一次洗了澡，换了干净衣服大步走出厂门的时候，当他们第一次在食堂的凳上坐下来，端起热菜饭的时候，他们的心中充满了多少的感激！
    风里来雨里去
    一个星期日，郭明昌照例要走到工厂去看一看。厂里静悄悄的，大部分人都休息去了。这时候，天边涌上了密密的雨云，一忽儿就哗哗地下起了瓢泼似的大雨，天井里没有出水沟，顿时涨起水来。“进水啦，进水啦，”有人在外边着急的喊。郭明昌想起仓库和车间里堆着许多猪毛，万一浸水就会生虫损失，就急忙冲出门去。大雨一会儿就把他淋得透湿，他在雨中挥着铁锹，挖出了一个大水塘，把地上的水引到塘里去。又在车间和仓库的门口筑起了土坝。留在厂里的几个人看到这情形，也一齐冲到雨里来了。这时雨水已灌进了仓库和车间，形势危急了，他们便一边筑坝，一边组织掏水。雨下了三个多小时，几个人在雨里斗争了几小时，当他们雨停之后走到屋子里，人人脸已都像一张白纸。但仓库和车间却没有受到损失。
    电台发出了台风紧急警报，疲劳异常的郭明昌又开始布置防台工作。台风对“永大”来说是一个可怕的敌人，他们的房屋早已是超龄的危险厂房，如果防备不好，什么危险都会发生。因为值班的人总是凑不齐，郭明昌便决定自己参加夜晚值班。一连三天，他白天工作，夜晚值班，疲劳袭击着他的全身，他不知多少次从困倦中挣扎出来。
    8月2日深夜，台风和暴雨终于一齐来到了。狂风怒号着，天空一片漆黑，郭明昌和几个值班的工人又一起冲进雨里，四处进行检查和抢救，在大雨里又淋了几个小时。台风一直刮到天明才稍为小了一些，有几个工人赶到厂来，说有好几家工人住的草房子被刮坏了。郭明昌一听这个消息，就邀了几个人，急急赶到工人住宅区去看望。
    这时风力还有七、八级，呼呼的响。路上还很不安全，树木、篱笆、电线横七竖八地倒得满地都是。当公方代表和别的同志在工人宿舍前出现时，好多正在抢修房子的工人们都惊住了。厂长竟跑到他们的草篷篷里来了，这是过去从来没有过的事。这次台风的损失果然不小，工人罗春喜家的竹篱笆墙，被台风刮得东倒西歪，工人李济达家的屋顶被整个掀掉了，郭明昌叮嘱李济达，要他停止工作一天，在家把屋顶修好。并且拨给他一些木料和稻草。其他一些受到台风灾害的工人，都得到了厂里的救济，度过了困难。
    郭明昌在区委组织部分配工作的时候，临行，区委负责同志再三告诉他：“你下厂去以后，最重要的就是要保持艰苦朴素的作风，同群众同甘共苦，以身作则，这是我们共产党员做好工作的最重要条件，到小厂去特别要注意这一点……。”从下厂的一天起，郭明昌就是不断地用这些话来唤醒自己、要求自己的。他第一个冲进了倾盆的大雨里；他每天几乎都最先来到工厂，每天又几乎都是他最后地熄灭办公室里的电灯。他几乎跑遍了全厂所有工人的家庭，把每个工人的疾苦都记在自己心上；他看到工人们披着麻袋当雨具赶来上班，就帮助工人解决雨伞；他看到工人们喝水要从车间奔到外边，就为工人添设茶杯。这些虽然都是小事，但工人们的心里该多么温暖呵。
    开花结果
    深刻的变化在这个小工厂里发生了。不管大风大雨，不管盛暑酷热，上班的工人一天天增多了，去年7月份缺勤曾达到12％，而9、10月份突然下降到只有2％，早退、迟到、旷工、打架，都消失了。
    根据青年工人李习生的倡议，从9月份起工厂改为三班制，劳动时间由过去一天九小时减到七小时半，但劳动生产率却直线地上升。
  6月份每个工人平均产值是一百零八元，到9月份已增长到二百三十六元。工厂的亏损局面完全扭转过来了。一个月的工缴费由过去的四千多元而增加到九千多元。公私合营前欠的工资四千多元发清了。工人每个月都能按时拿到工资。与银行的关系，由过去的欠债而变为经常存款几千元。
    一天，区委工业部长跑来探看郭明昌。他已听说郭明昌在永大厂工作条件很苦，一个多月里体重减轻了八斤，感到不放心，就跑来看他。当郭明昌迎面走来时，部长不觉心里一怔，这小伙子怎么瘦得这样多？眼眶下塌，边上围着一圈黑，看来过度的劳累把他磨倒了。
    “已经习惯厂的生活了吗？”
    “习惯了，工人能习惯，我怎么不能习惯？”郭明昌愉快地说。其实他不但是习惯，而是已深深地爱上了这个工厂，爱上了工人们。而工人们也是那么地爱着他。（附图片）
