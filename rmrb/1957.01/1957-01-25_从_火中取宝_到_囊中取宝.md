    From "Fishing for Treasure in Fire" to "Plucking Treasure from a Sack"
    Mei Li
    The lime produced by the Yangxi Lime Factory in Yidu County, Hubei Province, is specifically supplied to meet the agricultural needs of dozens of counties from Yidu to Yueyang, Hunan. However, the factory's rejection rate is very high, sometimes as low as 8%, but reaching as high as 70%-80%.

    Some workers believed that lime production was inherently "fishing for treasure in fire," and the quality was "determined by fate." Some cadres also believed that because the factory used manual operation, the quality could not be guaranteed. Last year, the Industry and Transportation Department of the county party committee required the factory to reduce the rejection rate to 3%, which caused the factory director a great deal of distress.

    Was there a solution? At the factory's workers' congress, the workers' speeches, especially the criticisms and opinions of the technicians, helped the factory's leadership become more clear-headed. They saw that although the factory had many rejects, sometimes there were relatively few; what a huge difference between 80% and 8%! Considering the personnel, some technicians' product quality wasn't bad. If these differences were studied and many scattered experiences were gathered together, couldn't a way to improve product quality be found?

    After the workers' congress, the factory organized two experimental groups composed of technicians and skilled workers, and summarized the improvement suggestions made at the workers' congress, concentrating the experiment on one kiln. During the experiment, the coal, coal briquettes, and stones in the kiln were all weighed, and the kiln's diameter, the height of each layer, the total number of layers, and the total height were all measured with a tape measure and recorded. The factory's leadership hoped to find the law to ensure product quality from these scientific calculations. This approach caused some people to doubt, saying "How can manual operation be so meticulous," "Even if the experiment is successful, how can dozens of kilns all be weighed?" The first experimental kiln failed, and the rejection rate not only did not decrease, but increased. However, because detailed records were kept, the reason was quickly found after research; it turned out that too much coal was used.

    Learning from the experience and lessons of the first experimental kiln, the second experimental kiln was successful, strictly following the calculated ratio of coal and stone for firing. The workers carried lime down from the top of the more than five-zhang (1 zhang is about 3.3 meters) high kiln, one load at a time. After one layer was removed, there were no rejects; after another layer was removed, there were still no rejects; all the way to the bottom of the kiln, there were no rejects in the entire kiln.

    After several experiments, a set of operating procedures was summarized. Workers only needed a wooden ruler to accurately load the kiln, and the concern that they could not weigh the stones every day was also dispelled.

    However, the new method was not accepted by everyone. The habitual force of using the old method was still very strong. The leadership did not anticipate this situation and simply announced the new method in the form of an order. Some technicians used the new method in front of the technicians, but still used the old method behind their backs. Moreover, because the order was too rigid, not allowing anyone to make slight changes, scientific things were turned into unscientific things. The wind direction, coal quality, stone type, the fire of each layer... were all different, and the order "no one is allowed to make any changes" restricted the technicians' enthusiasm. An old worker clearly saw that the kiln he was in charge of should add coal due to special wind conditions, but was afraid of "violating the operating procedures" and dared not add it, resulting in an increase in rejects. This deviation was promptly discovered and corrected by the leadership.

    The leadership noticed this problem and revised the responsibility system for the technician team leaders, stipulating that the team leader is fully responsible for the quality of the kiln, and he has the right to increase or decrease the amount of coal used by up to four hundred jin (1 jin is about 0.5 kg) based on the overall situation of the fire in each layer. This increased the technicians' sense of responsibility, stimulated their enthusiasm, and enabled them to better implement the operating procedures based on specific circumstances.

    The new operating method was universally welcomed. The old workers felt that the operation was based on evidence and they could worry less; the new workers felt that the operating method had regulations and was easy to master. Relying on only seven old technicians and the operating procedures obtained from arduous experiments, the factory quickly trained a large number of new technicians, and the rejection rate was reduced to 2%.

    Producing good quality lime, for this manual operation factory, was no longer "fishing for treasure in fire" but "plucking treasure from a sack."

    从“火中取宝”到“囊中取宝”
    梅力
    湖北宜都县洋溪石灰厂制造的石灰，专门供给从宜都到湖南岳阳等几十个县的农田需要。但是，这个厂的废品率很高，低时有8％，最高竟达到70％—80％。
    一部分工人认为，石灰生产本来就是“火中取宝”，质量好坏要由“天定”。有些干部也认为厂里是手工操作，质量不能保证。去年，县委工业交通工作部要求厂里把废品降到3％，厂长也是一阵苦恼。
    有没有办法呢？在全厂工人大会上，工人们的发言，特别是技工们的批评和意见，使厂的领导干部头脑清醒了一些。他们看到厂里的废品虽多，但有时候也比较少，80％和8％是多么大的悬殊啊！就拿人来说，也有些技工的产品质量并不差。如果研究这些差别，把许多零散的经验集中起来，不就可以找到提高产品质量的道路了吗？
    工人大会以后，厂里组织了两个由技师、技工参加的试验小组，把工人大会上提出的改进意见归纳起来，集中在一个窑上试验。在试验过程中，煤、煤饼、窑里的石头都用秤称，窑的直径、各层的高度、总层数和总高度都用皮尺量，并且都把它记录下来。厂的领导人员是希望从这些科学的计算中，找出保证产品质量的规律。这种做法引起一部分人的怀疑，他们说“手工操作哪能这么讲究”，“即便试验成功，几十座窑哪能都用秤称”。第一试验窑失败了，废品不但没有减少，反而增多。但是，由于详细地作了记录，经过研究，很快找出了原因，原来是煤用得过多了。
    吸取了第一次试窑的经验和教训，严格按着核算出来的煤和石头的比例进行烧制，第二次试窑成功了。工人们从五丈多高的窑顶上一担一担地往下挑石灰。一层挑完了，没有废品；又一层挑完了，仍然没有废品；一直挑到窑底，全窑都没有废品。
    经过几次试验，总结出一套操作规程。工人只要用一根木尺，就可以准确地把窑装好，担忧无法每天用秤称石头的顾虑也解除了。
    但是，新方法并没有为每一个人接受。沿用了旧法的习惯力量还很大。领导上没有估计到这个情况，简单地把新方法以命令形式公布了。有的技工当着技术员的面用新方法，背后仍用旧方法。而且由于命令规定得太死，任何人不准稍许变动，就把科学的东西变成不科学的了。风向、煤质、石头的种类、各层的火候……都不一样，“任何人不许稍动”这个命令束缚了技工的积极性。一个老工人分明看到自己掌握的窑由于风力的特殊原因，应该加煤，但怕“违反操作规程”不敢加，结果废品上升了。这个偏差及时被领导上发觉和纠正了。
    领导上注意到这个问题，修订了技工组长的责任制度，规定组长对窑的质量负全责，他有权根据各层火力的总情况，增加或减少四百斤以内的用煤量。这样就增加了技工们的责任感，发挥了他们的积极性，能够更好地根据具体情况贯彻操作规程。
    新的操作方法受到普遍的欢迎。老工人觉得操作有根据，可以少操心；新工人感到操作方法有规定，容易掌握。厂里依靠仅有的七个老技工和从艰苦试验中得来的操作规程，很快地培养出一大批新技工，废品率降低到2％。
    生产质量良好的石灰，对这个手工操作的工厂说来，已经不是“火中取宝”而是“囊中取宝”了。
