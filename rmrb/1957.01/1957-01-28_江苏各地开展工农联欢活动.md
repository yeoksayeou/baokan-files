Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 27th: Recently, more than 3,000 workers, farmers, and intellectuals in Wuxi City held a get-together at the Workers' Cultural Palace, organizing a garden party where they visited each other and discussed their respective work situations. Many employees from Wuxi, Changzhou, and other cities who had visited disaster areas introduced the production and living conditions of farmers in the disaster areas to the employees, which was educational and inspiring for everyone. Employees of the grain department in Changzhou City expressed their intention to learn from the farmers' spirit of hard work and do their own jobs well. They processed five million jin of rice in ten days, and the quality all met standard specifications.
