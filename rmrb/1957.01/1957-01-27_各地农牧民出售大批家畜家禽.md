Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Before the Spring Festival this year, farmers and herdsmen in various regions sold large quantities of pigs, cattle, sheep, and poultry to supply urban residents for a joyful Spring Festival. Since the beginning of January, food companies have purchased an average of 110,000 pigs and nearly 10,000 cattle and sheep daily. Compared to the daily purchase volume in the same period last year, pig purchases increased by more than 50%, and cattle and sheep purchases increased by more than 20%.

　　These days, food company purchasing stations set up in rural areas are particularly busy. Groups of farmers come here to sell pigs or deliver pigs to the state according to pre-purchase contracts. Every day, farmers in Sichuan and Jiangsu, the two provinces with the largest pig farming, sell about 20,000 pigs to the state. Sichuan Province reaches more than 26,000 at most; Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan and other provinces with more pig farming also sell about 10,000. With the help of township people's committees and agricultural cooperative cadres, many farmers have adopted the method of self-raising, self-slaughtering, and sharing, adjusting among themselves to ensure that every family has meat to eat during the Spring Festival, while also being able to provide more pigs to the cities. For example, two agricultural production cooperatives in Shanwang Township, Feidong County, Anhui Province, raised 347 fat pigs before the Spring Festival. After mutual consultation among the cooperative members, 113 were slaughtered and shared, with each member receiving an average of one jin of meat. The remaining 234 pigs were sold to the food company.

　　In the past month or so, commercial and transportation departments have been working intensively on the transfer and adjustment of live pigs. In the first half of January alone, 160,000 pigs were transported from Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and other provinces to Shanghai, and 160,000 pigs were transported from Henan, Shandong and Hebei to Beijing and Tianjin. This ensured that all the pigs needed for the Spring Festival in these three cities were prepared. Large quantities of cattle and sheep were transported from Inner Mongolia and Qinghai, and pork from Sichuan was also transported to Wuhan.

    各地农牧民出售大批家畜家禽
    新华社26日讯　今年春节前，各地农民和牧民出售了大批猪、牛、羊和家禽，供给城市人民欢度春节。进入1月份以来，食品公司每天平均买进十一万头猪和近万头牛、羊，同去年同期的日收购量相比，猪增长50％以上，牛、羊增长20％多。
    这些日子，设在农村里的食品公司收购站特别忙碌，成群结队的农民来到这里卖猪或者按合同交售国家预购的生猪。每天，养猪最多的四川、江苏两省的农民卖给国家的猪都在两万头左右，四川省最多的时候达到两万六千多头；广东、浙江、河南等养猪较多的省也在一万头左右。许多农民在乡人民委员会和农业社干部的帮助下，采取自养自宰分食的办法，相互调剂，做到家家过春节有肉吃，同时能够拿出更多的猪来供应城市。如安徽省肥东县山王乡的两个农业生产合作社到春节前养成肥猪三百四十七头，经过社员间相互协商后自宰分食一百一十三头，两社每人平均能得到一斤肉，其余的二百三十四头猪卖给食品公司。
    近一个多月来，商业和运输部门紧张地进行了调运和调剂生猪的工作。仅在1月上、中旬，从江苏、安徽、浙江、江西等省运到上海的猪达十六万头，从河南、山东、河北运到北京、天津的猪也有十六万头。使这三个城市春节需要的猪全部准备好了。内蒙古和青海等地运出了大批牛羊，四川的猪肉也运到了武汉市。
