Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 5th. The total output value of Anshan Iron and Steel in 1956 increased by 45% compared with 1955. Steelmaking and ironmaking both overfulfilled the annual national production plan. Pig iron production increased by 35% compared with 1955, steel production increased by 87%, and steel production increased by 73.9%.
    Since the second half of 1956, with the help of Soviet experts, the quality of Anshan Iron and Steel products has been greatly improved. In the first half of the year, only 82 tons of first-class heavy steel rails were produced per 100 tons; in the second half of the year, this increased to 92 tons. The qualification rate of steel wire rope also increased from 88.6% in the first half of the year to over 98.5%. In addition, the quality of steel products such as medium plates, welded steel pipes, and thin plates has also been improved.
    In 1956, Anshan Iron and Steel achieved great success in adopting new technologies and popularizing advanced experiences. The ironmaking plant successfully implemented high blast temperature operation with humidified air blast, used self-fluxing sintered ore, and smelted low-manganese steel, which greatly reduced the quotas for coke, manganese ore, and limestone, so that the blast furnace volume utilized per ton of iron per day decreased from 0.845 cubic meters in 1955 to 0.735 cubic meters, and the average daily output increased by 15% compared with 1955. Other advanced experiences, such as the rapid steelmaking experience promoted by the First Steelmaking Plant and the rapid rolling, rapid roll changing, and rapid steel heating promoted by the rolling mills, have played a significant role in production. A total of 650 technical measures were implemented throughout the year, of which 15 technical measures with relatively significant effects created a value of 39.6 million yuan in one year. The value created by implementing these technical measures alone can recover the total amount of investment in technical measures for the entire year.
    In terms of product costs, there has also been a significant reduction. Compared with the cost level in 1955, the total cost savings of Anshan Iron and Steel in 1956 are enough to build six automated and mechanized blast furnaces.

    鞍钢去年生产水平提高很快
    比前年：生铁增加35％，钢增加87％，钢材增加73.9％
    新华社鞍山5日电　鞍钢1956年的生产总值比1955年提高了45％。炼钢、炼铁都超额完成全年国家生产计划。生铁产量比1955年增加35％钢，产量增加87％，钢材产量增加73.9％。
    鞍钢产品的质量，从1956年下半年起，在苏联专家的帮助下，有了不少改进。上半年出厂的重钢轨，每一百吨中一级品只有八十二吨；到下半年提高到九十二吨。钢绳的合格率也由上半年的88.6％提高到98.5％以上。此外中板、焊接钢管、薄板等钢材的质量也都提高了。
    1956年，鞍钢在采用新技术和推广先进经验方面取得了很大成绩。炼铁厂成功地推行加湿鼓风的高风温操作，使用自熔性的烧结矿，并且冶炼低锰制钢铁，大大降低了焦炭、锰矿和石灰石的定额，使每吨铁每昼夜所利用的高炉容积从1955年的零点八四五立方公尺，减少为零点七三五立方公尺，平均日产量比1955年提高15％。其他如第一炼钢厂推行的快速炼钢经验，轧钢各厂推行的快速轧钢、快速换辊、快速烧钢等先进经验，对生产都起了很大的作用。全年共实现了六百五十项技术措施，其中十五项效果比较显著的技术措施，一年创造价值达三千九百六十万元，单是实现这些技术措施所创造的价值，就可以收回全年技术措施投资的总数。
    在产品成本方面，也有显著降低。同1955年的成本水平比较，鞍钢在1956年节约的成本总额足够兴建六座自动化、机械化的高炉。
