Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, January 4th: Officers of many companies of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front have received letters from the families of new soldiers, thanking the troops for the education and training of their children. Since enlisting last year, Chen Kuiwei, a private in the 8th Company of a certain unit, has achieved excellent results in shooting, and his cultural level has also greatly improved. Recently, Chen Kuiwei's father, Chen Shengzhou, wrote to the company commander and political instructor of this company, saying: "My son has received your care, cultivation, and education, and I am very grateful." Wu Jianmin, the company commander of a certain communications unit, received a thank-you letter from Shanghai, sent by the brother of Senior Private Zhou Yakang. Zhou Yakang gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party in the army this year and has been rewarded three times by the regiment and company. Pan Chunshan, a military family member from Fu'an County, Fujian Province, expressed in his letter to the company commander and political instructor of the 8th Company of a certain coastal defense unit that he must improve his production team and produce more grain to support the People's Liberation Army and the country's economic construction.

Many families of new soldiers also asked their children in their letters to convey their gratitude to the leaders of the troops, and instructed them to study harder and become outstanding national defense fighters.

These letters powerfully encourage the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army to advance together.
