Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 20th - Hubei Province has currently established over 6,000 private elementary schools, with more than 330,000 students studying in these schools, accounting for approximately 12% of the total number of elementary school students in the province. Furthermore, over 70,000 children throughout the province are studying in private literacy classes.

These schools have been established based on needs and the voluntary principle of the masses. The people of Hubei have a good tradition of running schools. After liberation, they established many elementary schools themselves. Later, the cultural and educational departments once adopted a method of taking over and running them entirely as public schools. However, this could not fully meet the enrollment needs of the vast number of school-age children. Therefore, private elementary schools continued to develop in various places. Under the influence of the cooperative movement upsurge in 1955, especially after the bumper harvest in 1956, the development of private elementary schools became even more rapid. Currently, private elementary schools are generally run by cooperatives, cooperatives with government assistance, private individuals with cooperative assistance, or through the form of "who studies, who pays." Teachers are also selected by the school organizers themselves, with sources mainly being intellectuals in the countryside, middle and elementary school graduates, demobilized soldiers, or transferred industrialists and businessmen.

The cultural and educational departments of each county and leaders at all levels actively help to solve the difficulties in teaching and administrative leadership of these private elementary schools, paying particular attention to strengthening their leadership in business to improve the quality of teaching. Counties such as Enshi, Yingshan, and Gong'an have all absorbed teachers with lower education levels from private elementary schools to participate in correspondence courses and spare-time cultural school studies, organized demonstration classes, observations, research on teaching materials, and seminars on lesson preparation, or organized public elementary school and private elementary school teachers to jointly establish teaching and research groups to conduct business studies and solve various teaching problems. The teachers of private elementary schools have expressed warm support and welcome for these measures.

    更好地满足适龄儿童的入学要求
    湖北兴办六千多所民办小学
    新华社武汉20日电　湖北省目前已办有六千多所民办小学，有三十三万多学生在这些学校学习，约占全省小学生总数的12％左右。全省还有七万多儿童在民办识字班里学习。
    这些学校是根据需要和群众自愿的原则兴办的。湖北人民有着良好的办学习惯，解放后，他们自己办了不少小学，后来文教部门曾一度采取包下来的办法完全公办，但这样不能完全满足广大适龄儿童的入学问题。因此，各地民办小学仍有所发展。1955年在合作化高潮的影响下，特别是1956年大丰收后，民办小学的发展更为迅速。目前民办小学一般有合作社办、合作社办民助、民办合作社助或谁读书谁出钱的形式。教师也由办学者自己选任，来源多为在乡知识分子，中、小学毕业生，转业军人或转业工商业者。
    各县的文教部门和各级领导，积极帮助解决这些民办小学教学和行政领导上的困难，特别注意在业务上加强对他们的领导，以提高教学质量。恩施、应山、公安等县都吸收了民办小学文化程度较低的教师参加函授和业余文化学校学习，组织示范教课、观摩、研究教材和备课的座谈，或组织公立小学和民办小学教师联合成立教研组，进行业务学习和解决各种教学问题。民办小学的教师们对这些措施表示热诚的拥护和欢迎。
