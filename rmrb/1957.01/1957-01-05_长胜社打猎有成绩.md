    Changsheng Cooperative Achieves Success in Hunting
    Since the beginning of last winter, the Changsheng Agricultural Cooperative of Shenshu Township, Tieli County, Heilongjiang Province, organized a hunting team of sixteen people to go into the mountains to hunt. In less than two months, they have hunted more than forty wild boars, more than one hundred martens, and more than ten roe deer, adding a considerable sideline income for the cooperative.

    长胜社打猎有成绩
    黑龙江省铁力县神树乡长胜农业社，在去年入冬以后，组织了一支拥有十六人的打猎队，入山打猎。还不到两个月的时间，就狩获了四十多只野猪、一百多只元皮和十多只狍子，又为社增加了一笔不小的副业收入。　（于敏）（附图片）
