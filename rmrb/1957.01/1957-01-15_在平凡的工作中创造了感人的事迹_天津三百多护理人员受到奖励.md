Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 14th: Tianjin held a nursing work conference on the 12th and 13th. Three hundred and two outstanding nursing staff members were rewarded at this meeting.

These excellent nursing workers have created many touching deeds in their daily ordinary work. Among the 95 awarded nursing staff with over 20 years of service, the oldest is Li Mingzhen, a veteran nurse from Tianjin People's Hospital. She has worked diligently and conscientiously for 42 years, caring for patients and rescuing the sick. She Yunzhu, the head nurse of Tianjin First Central Hospital, who once studied at university and studied abroad in the United States, has also persisted in her nursing position for more than 20 years. She actively studies nursing technology and science. During the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, she accompanied the volunteer medical team to the battlefield and used sand and milk bottles to make a "sand clock" to replace the timer for the sterilizing steamer, and wooden supports to replace the back support beds. In a few months, she created more than 90 types and more than 1,000 pieces of medical equipment, overcoming the difficulties of the simple medical equipment on the battlefield at that time. Recently, the "prepared clinical operation procedures" she implemented in the obstetrics department not only reduced the labor intensity of the staff, but also made nursing operations more reasonable and standardized.

Among the awarded young nursing workers is Guo Wenzhen, an assistant midwife from the Beitang Medical and Preventive Station in Tanggu District. She has been engaged in midwifery work for less than five years. Because of her patient promotion to the masses, regardless of cold or heat, day or night, she has worked tirelessly to go deep into the residents to serve pregnant women. Now, in this difficult fishing area, 95% of pregnant women undergo prenatal check-ups. The phenomenon of newborn infants dying from tetanus has been completely eliminated.

At the meeting, Yang Zhenya, Director of the Tianjin Municipal Public Health Bureau, gave a report on nursing work issues. He put forward some suggestions for improvement on issues such as scientific research, education, promotion, and welfare benefits for nursing staff, and asked the administrative leaders of various hospitals to treat nursing work as an important and regular task in the future. Many nursing worker representatives also put forward opinions and requests for improving the current nursing work, and unanimously expressed that they would love their work and better improve the quality of nursing work.

    在平凡的工作中创造了感人的事迹
    天津三百多护理人员受到奖励
    新华社天津14日电　天津市在12日和13日举行了护理工作会议。三百零二名优秀的护理人员在这个会上受到了奖励。
    这些优秀的护理工作者在日常平凡的工作中创造了许多感人的事迹。受奖的九十五名二十年工龄以上的护理人员中，工龄最老的是天津市人民医院的老护士李明贞。她辛辛苦苦、任劳任怨地为护理病人和抢救病人而工作了四十二年。曾经读过大学和留学美国的天津市第一中心医院护士主任佘韫珠，坚持护士工作岗位也有二十多年了。她积极钻研护理技术科学，抗美援朝期间，曾经随志愿医疗队在战地上，用沙子和牛奶瓶作成“沙表”，代替消毒蒸锅的计时表，用木支架代替靠背支架床。几个月里她创造了九十多种、一千多件医疗用具，克服了当时战地医疗设备简陋的困难。最近她在产科试行的“准备临床操作规程”，不但减少了工作人员的劳动强度，而且使护理操作更加合理和合乎标准。
    受奖的青年护理工作者中，有塘沽区北塘医疗预防站助产士郭文贞，她从事助产工作还不到五年，由于她耐心地向群众宣传，不论寒暑、昼夜，不辞辛苦地深入居民中为产妇服务，使这个条件困难的渔民区里，现在达到95％的孕妇都进行产前检查。新生婴儿因破伤风而死亡的现象已经完全消灭了。
    会议上，天津市公共卫生局局长杨振亚作了护理工作问题的报告。他就护理人员的科学研究、教育、晋级和福利待遇等问题提出了一些改进意见，要求各医院的行政领导上今后要把护理工作作为一项重要的经常工作。许多护理工作者代表也提出了改进目前护理工作的意见和要求，并且一致表示要热爱自己的工作，更好的提高护理工作质量。
