In the wax paper dragging workshop of the Wenzhou Wax Paper Factory, the female workers like to ask each other after work: "Did you produce any waste paper today?" If the other party says with a smile: "One hundred percent," that means her quality is completely up to standard and no waste products were produced. At this time, the companions are always happy and laugh. If someone answers: "Terrible, four 'nines'," that means she produced one waste paper today, and the quality only reached 99.9999%.

A year ago, hearing "four nines" was really enviable, but now "one hundred percent" is so common that "four nines" has become an object they are eliminating in production. In April of last year, two groups in the wax paper dragging workshop launched a friendly competition. Since the start of the competition, they have been as united as sisters. As long as one person produces a problem, they all kindly come to help her find the cause and grasp the key. Zheng Lizhong, a paper feeder, originally failed to complete her plan every month. After the competition, everyone came to help Zheng Lizhong improve product quality. When she was demonstrating, Zhu Zhilan carefully saw that the reason she couldn't complete the plan was because her palms were too dry and she couldn't suck the paper when adding paper. She gave her the glycerin she brought with her to wipe on, and taught her her own operating experience. From that month on, Zheng Lizhong completed her plan every month.

By the end of April, the waste products of the entire workshop had been reduced from more than 1,000 sheets in the past to more than 300 sheets, and the waste product rate reached one in ten thousand. At the meeting commemorating the "May Fourth" Youth Day, the factory director announced that the wax paper dragging workshop was named an "Excellent Youth Workshop" and awarded them a glorious red flag.

In order to create new labor achievements and maintain collective honor, the workers in the wax paper dragging workshop reduced the waste paper of the entire workshop from more than 300 sheets to 25 sheets in May, with a waste product rate of less than one in one hundred thousand. From September, their production plan has been overfulfilled every month, and the waste product rate has always been maintained at one or two in one hundred thousand. This caused a problem for the workshop recorder. If the recorder wants to correctly record the product qualification rate of this workshop, it is 99.9999%, and according to national regulations, the value below two decimal places of the percentage is rounded off, so the product qualification rate is all 100%.

The wax paper dragging workshop workers' emphasis on quality has been established after many painful lessons. In 1953, they only focused on increasing production and ignored quality. As a result, more than 4,000 rolls of wax paper were shipped to Shanghai and failed the inspection. The factory had to send three workers from the wax paper dragging workshop to Shanghai with a wax paper dragging machine to process the unqualified wax paper. Once, a copyist sent a letter saying that he used Lighthouse brand wax paper to copy a document, and the wax paper broke halfway through, wasting half a day. A user angrily wrote five "study" characters in a critique letter, asking them to learn from the Alarm Clock brand wax paper of Daming Wax Paper Factory. When these letters were read out in the workshop, they felt extremely uncomfortable. They deeply realized that quality is the life of the factory.

The responsible spirit of the young female workers for production is very moving. In the past, some workers would be so sad that they couldn't eat when they produced waste products and would cry on the machine. But what's the use of crying? However, since the competition was launched last year, the workshop has organized regular technical learning, and the technically proficient help the technically less proficient. No more workers can be seen crying in the workshop. The workers always walk in and out of the workshop with a happy mood.

Now this workshop produces more than 3 million sheets of wax paper every month. About one-third of the country's wax paper is processed by their hands, one sheet at a time. They have also processed a special wax paper for export to the Soviet Union.

On December 13th last year, the female workers of this excellent youth workshop held a brief meeting. At the meeting, they resolved to strive to ensure that the entire workshop does not produce a single waste product in the future.

    她们在消灭废品
    高扶小
    温州蜡纸厂拖蜡车间的女工们，下班时爱相互问一问：“你今天出了废纸没有？”要是对方带有微笑地说：“百分之百”，那就是她的质量完全合乎标准，没有出废品。这时，同伴们总是高兴得笑起来。如果有人回答：“要命的，四个‘九’”，那就是她今天出了一张废纸，质量只达到99.9999％。
    在一年以前，听到“四个九”那真叫人羡慕极了，可是现在“百分之百”是那样地多，“四个九”已成为她们在生产上消灭的对象了。去年4月，拖蜡车间两个小组开展了友谊竞赛。自竞赛开始，她们就团结得像亲姊妹一样，只要有一个人生产出了毛病她们就都亲切地跑来，帮助她找原因抓关键。添纸工郑丽众本来月月完不成计划，在竞赛后大家都来帮助郑丽众提高产品质量。在她表演时朱芝兰很细心地看出了她完不成计划的原因是因她的手掌心太干燥，添纸时吸不住纸，就把自己身边带的甘油给她擦上，并把自己的操作经验教给她，就从这个月起，郑丽众月月完成了计划。
    4月底到了，全车间的废品从过去每月一千多张降低到三百多张，废品率达到一万分之一。在纪念“五四”青年节的会上，厂长宣布把拖蜡车间命名为“优秀的青年车间”，并授给她们一面光荣的红旗。
    拖蜡车间的工人为了创造新的劳动成绩，保持集体荣誉，5月份，全车间的废纸又从三百多张减少到二十五张，废品率不到十万分之一。从9月份起她们的产量计划月月超额完成，废品率始终保持在十万分之一、二。这样可给车间记录员出了一个难题，记录员如果要正确地记录这个车间的正品率，那就是99.9999％，而按照国家的规定，百分比小数点两位以下的数值是四舍五入，这样正品率就全部是百分之百了。
    拖蜡车间工人重视质量的思想，是经过许多痛苦的教训才树立起来的。1953年，她们只顾增产不顾质量，结果有四千多筒蜡纸运到上海检验不合格，厂里只好派了拖蜡车间三个工人，带了一部拖蜡车到上海对不合格的蜡纸进行加工。一次，一个抄写员寄来了一封信说，他用灯塔牌蜡纸抄写一个文件，抄到一半蜡纸就坏了，白白地浪费了他半天时间。一个用户气愤地在批评信上一连写了五个“学习”，要求她们向大明蜡纸厂警钟牌蜡纸学习。当这些来信在车间宣读的时候，她们的心难受极了，她们深深地体会到质量就是工厂的生命。
    青年女工们对生产的负责精神是很感动人的。从前，有的工人出了废品会难过得饭也吃不下，爬在车上流泪。但是哭又有什么用呢？可是自从去年开展竞赛以后，车间里组织了经常的技术学习，技术高的帮助技术低的。车间里再也看不到工人哭了，工人们总是怀着愉快的心情走进走出车间。
    现在这个车间每个月出产蜡纸有三百几十万张，全国约有三分之一的蜡纸，就是经过她们的双手，一张一张地加工出来的。她们还加工过一种特制的蜡纸，出口到苏联去。
    去年12月13日，这个优秀青年车间的女工们开了一个简短的会议，会上她们决心以后争取做到全车间不出一张废品。
