    Remove This Kind of "Wall"
    The Yangtze River Navigation Administration, in order to take care of leading cadres, has two measures in place regarding welfare: first, cadres at the section chief level and above do not have to queue up for registration when seeing a doctor at the staff hospital; they can see a doctor as soon as they arrive; second, a barber shop has been specially built for division chief cadres, who can get a haircut as soon as they arrive. Cadres below say: "This is the section chiefs' hospital, this is the division chiefs' barber shop."
    It seems that seeing a doctor and getting a haircut are trivial matters in life. However, it is precisely because these trivial matters are made "special" that an invisible "wall" is erected between leading cadres and ordinary cadres.
                                                                    Li Yukun

    取消这种“围墙”
    长江航运管理局为了照顾领导干部，在生活福利方面有两项措施：一是规定科长以上干部到职工医院看病不用排队挂号，随到随看；一是为处长干部专门修建了一个理发室，处长干部可以随到随理。下面干部说：“这是科长的医院，这是处长理发厅。”
    看起来，看病、理发都是生活上的小事。但是，正因为这些小事“特殊”化起来，就在领导干部与一般干部之间架起了一堵无形的“围墙”。　　　李玉昆
