Eliminate Harmful Birds and Animals, Protect Beneficial Birds and Animals
Ministry of Agriculture Holds Meeting to Discuss Further Implementation Plan

(Our Newspaper) The work of preventing and controlling bird and animal pests across the country in 1956 has achieved certain successes. According to incomplete statistics from twelve provinces, including Jilin, Fujian, and Hunan, alone, over 112.95 million harmful birds and over 45.046 million harmful animals were captured and killed. This played a certain role in ensuring increased crop production and the safety of people and livestock in 1956. However, because preventing and controlling bird and animal pests is a new task, and it involves a wide range of issues, there are still some problems in terms of organizational leadership, labor compensation, and coordination between relevant departments.

In order to summarize the achievements of the 1956 prevention and control of bird and animal pest work, exchange experiences, and prepare for the continued prevention and control of bird and animal pests this year to achieve the goal of ensuring increased crop production and the safety of people and livestock, the Ministry of Agriculture convened a reporting meeting on the prevention and control of bird and animal pest work on the 15th of this month, attended by fifteen provinces and cities, including Jilin and Fujian. After listening to the reports from the representatives of the above-mentioned provinces and cities on the work of preventing and controlling bird and animal pests in 1956, the meeting held a detailed discussion.

After discussion, the representatives unanimously agreed that the practical experience of the past year has proven that preventing and controlling bird and animal pests is an arduous and complex task. Therefore, all localities must pay attention to strengthening organizational leadership and widely mobilizing the masses. At the same time, full-time or part-time cadres should be assigned to be responsible for this work, and close cooperation should be obtained with relevant units such as military service, civil affairs, health, supply and marketing, purchasing, and scientific research institutions.

Reasonably resolving the labor compensation for capturing and killing harmful birds and animals is an important link in encouraging agricultural cooperative members to actively participate in the prevention and control of bird and animal pests. The meeting requested that all localities conscientiously implement the principle of "distribution according to work" and give hunters the compensation they deserve. Appropriate rewards should also be given to those team members who have high skills, good performance, and achievements.

The meeting also discussed the protection of beneficial birds and animals and the safety issues in carrying out the prevention and control of bird and animal pest work, and put forward many suggestions for improvement. (Shao Likun)

    消灭害鸟害兽　保护益鸟益兽
    农业部召开会议讨论了进一步开展这项工作的方针
    本报讯　1956年全国各地的防治鸟兽害工作已取得一定成绩。仅据吉林、福建、湖南等十二个省的不完全统计，就捕打了各种害鸟一亿一千二百九十五万多只、各种害兽四千五百零四万六千多只。这对保障1956年农作物增产和人畜安全，起了一定的作用。但由于防治鸟兽害是一项新的工作，而且牵涉的范围又广，因此在组织领导、劳动报酬、各有关部门之间的配合等方面，还存在着一些问题。
    为了总结1956年防治鸟兽害工作成绩，交流经验，并为今年继续开展防治鸟兽害作好准备，以达到保障农作物增产和人畜安全的目的，农业部在本月15日召开了吉林、福建等十五个省、市的防治鸟兽害工作汇报会议。会议在听取了上述各省、市代表关于1956年的防治鸟兽害工作情况的汇报后，进行了详细的讨论。
    经过讨论，代表们一致认为：一年来实际工作的经验证明，防治鸟兽害是一项艰巨、复杂的工作。因此，各地必须注意加强组织领导，广泛发动群众。同时，还要配备专职或兼职干部来负责这一工作，并同兵役、民政、卫生、供销、采购、科学研究机关等有关单位取得密切配合。
    合理解决捕打害鸟、害兽的劳动报酬，是鼓励农业社员积极参加防治鸟兽害工作的重要环节。会议要求各地认真贯彻“按劳取酬”的原则，给打猎队员以应得的报酬。对于那些技术高、表现好、有成绩的队员，还应给予适当的奖励。
    会议对于保护益鸟、益兽和开展防治鸟兽害工作中的安全问题，也进行了讨论，并提出了许多改进的意见。　（邵礼昆）
