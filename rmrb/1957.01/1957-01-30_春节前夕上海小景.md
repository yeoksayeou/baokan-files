    Shanghai Scenes on the Eve of the Spring Festival
    On the eve of the Spring Festival in Shanghai, the sun is shining brightly, and it is as warm as spring. In the flower markets on the streets, roses, chrysanthemums, and wintersweet are all in full bloom. Tens of thousands of food stores, department stores, toy stores, clothing stores... throughout the city have been packed with customers in recent days. The state-owned No. 1 Department Store on Nanjing Road has 300,000 customers every day. The nearby large-scale state-owned food store has recently expanded its business space, but it is still crowded with people buying goods for the New Year, making it difficult to move.
    While every household is preparing to celebrate the New Year, the most deserted places are the pawnshops that remain. In the old society, at the end of the year, when the weather was cold, poor people could not get through this "New Year's hurdle" and had to take off their cotton clothes and stand in the long lines in front of the pawnshops in the wind and snow. Now, most pawnshops have closed. The reporter managed to find a "Tailai Pawnshop" with a sign that read "Small Amount Pledge Loan Business Office." It was almost deserted. An old clerk surnamed Jiang said: "Now we rely on the state bank to maintain our lives. It seems we can only prepare to change careers."
    Opening the newspapers from before liberation, the headlines "Money!" "Tight!" in extra-large fonts a few days before the Spring Festival were frightening. Businessmen who were short of funds could not even reunite with their families on New Year's Eve and had to go to hotels and bathhouses to avoid creditors. This year, the reporter specifically visited several people in the banking industry to understand their current situation. They said that after the joint state-private ownership of private enterprises in the city, the enterprise deposits are more than the loans. So far, they have not heard of any stores that cannot get through the "hurdle." Ordinary residents are also very well-off. According to the People's Bank of Shanghai, in the first half of January, savings deposits in the city increased by more than 6 million yuan, reversing the past pre-holiday trend.
    In the City God Temple bazaar, erhus, gongs and drums, diabolo, and kaleidoscopes are in short supply. The daily turnover of the "Jingyinzhai" musical instrument store has tripled compared to the Spring Festival before last year. In the past, almost every household had to worship the "God of Wealth" during the Spring Festival. Now, the "God of Wealth" has no place in candle shops. The reporter only found one candle shop that prepared twenty paper horses of the "Five Roads God of Wealth," but no one has asked about them yet. It turns out that people have placed their hopes for "good luck in the coming year" on labor, rather than expecting that illusory God of Wealth.

### 春节前夕上海小景

    春节前夕上海小景
    春节前夕的上海，阳光灿烂，温暖如春，街头花市上玫瑰、菊花和腊梅同时怒放。全市千万家食品店、百货店、玩具店、服装店……连日来顾客盈门。南京路上的国营第一百货商店每天拥有顾客三十万人；附近规模巨大的国营食品商店新近扩充了商场，仍然被采办年货的人们挤得寸步难行。
    在家家户户准备欢庆新春的时候，最冷落的要算那些残存下来的当铺了。在旧社会里，岁暮天寒，穷苦的人们过不去这个“年关”，只有脱下身上的棉衣，在风雪中，排进当铺门前的长长的队伍里。如今大多数当铺已经关门了，记者好容易找到一家挂着“小额质押贷款营业所”招牌的“泰来当”，简直是门可罗雀，一个姓江的老店员说：“现在我们依靠国家银行维持生活，看来只有准备转业。”
    翻开解放前的报纸，春节前几天“银根！”“紧！”特大号的标题令人怵目惊心。手头周转不灵的商人们旧历除夕夜也不能和家人团聚，不得不去开旅馆、进澡堂避避风头。今年记者特地去拜访几位银行界人士，了解他们现在的情况。他们说，在全市私营企业公私合营以后，企业存款比贷款还要多，至今尚未听说有任何商店过不了“关”的现象，一般居民手头也十分宽裕，据上海市的人民银行宣布，1月上半月，全市储蓄存款一反过去节前规律而增加了六百多万元。
    城隍庙商场里，胡琴锣鼓、扯铃、花筒供不应求。“京音斋”乐器店每天营业额比去年春节前增加了三倍。从前在春节里几乎家家户户都要供奉的“财神爷”，如今在香烛店里已经没有地位，记者只发现一家香烛店准备了“五路财神”纸马二十张，至今尚无人问津。原来人们已把“来年运道”寄托在劳动上，不再期望那虚无飘渺的财神老爷了。    　（新华社）
