    This was an extraordinary meeting. The Qinhuai River has flowed for millennia, but rarely has it seen such a meeting. Workers from seven metal handicraft production cooperatives in Nanjing's Baixia District visited members of the Gaoqiao and Meijialang agricultural production cooperatives.
    On the morning of the 20th, the workers'队伍 (d队伍 - ranks/contingent/team) marched out of the city along the Qinhuai River. They pushed carts filled with sickles, hoes, sprayers, and other farm tools, delivering these handmade items to the farmers. The day before, Xuan Zhangde, a worker at the Liberation Handicraft Cooperative, and three assistants had been working hard all day to make sickles and hoes. They said: "The gifts for our farmer brothers must be things they'll be happy to use." They ensured each forged piece was perfectly tempered before removing it from the furnace, and every hammer blow was steady and even. They exceptionally polished the completed sickles again and again. After dinner, the old carpenter Zhang Xuelin continued working for more than three hours. A repair group composed of more than sixty workers in six trades, including carpentry and forging, had also prepared all their tools to repair farm implements and household items for the farmers.
    On a square by the riverbank, it was as lively as a market. As soon as the workers arrived, they busied themselves lighting stoves and setting up blowers. Agricultural cooperative members came from all directions, like attending a fair, to greet the workers. Some farmers brought spades, hoes, sickles, washbasins, teapots, scissors, and wooden basins that needed repair, asking the workers to fix them. The clanging of hammers, the rasping of sharpening stones, and the whirring of saws blended into a lively sound. Workers and farmers exchanged greetings, and children ran around joyfully, eager to watch the excitement. The workers patiently repaired and welded the piles of old and worn items, one by one. The blacksmiths would ask, "Is this okay?" after forging each hoe and spade. After repairing each teapot and washbasin, the repair and welding team had someone carefully test it in water. If even a tiny pinhole was found, it would be immediately re-repaired and welded.
    The heads of the Gaoqiao Agricultural Cooperative and Meijialang Agricultural Cooperative, representing the members, accepted the gifts from the workers and thanked them for repairing many farm tools and implements. They also introduced the agricultural production situation to the workers. Both cooperatives had suffered from three major floods and two typhoons in 1956. The head of the Gaoqiao Cooperative said: "Our cooperative faced difficulties in life and production after the disaster, but it is still much better than before cooperation. Unlike the past, now we have difficulties, we also have the possibility and confidence to overcome them." They reported that before cooperation, one year when they encountered a flood, twenty-five out of twenty-six households in Meijialang were displaced from their homes. Last year after the disaster, neither cooperative had a single household leaving to flee famine. On the contrary, they actively developed sideline occupations and agricultural production, and strived to achieve a wheat yield equal to the largest bumper harvest year of 1955, namely, two hundred to three hundred catties per mu.
    That day, the workers also visited the homes of the affected members to offer condolences.
    That evening, the workers bid farewell to the farmers on the banks of the Qinhuai River. The friendship between workers and peasants will flow forever like the waters of the Qinhuai River.

    秦淮河畔的会见
    新华社记者　古平　孙振
    这是一次不平凡的会见。秦淮河水流了千万年，河畔上还少有这样的会见。南京市白下区七个金属手工业生产合作社的工人，在这里访问了高桥和梅家廊两个农业生产合作社的社员。
    20日早晨，工人的队伍出城沿着秦淮河前进。他们推着装满了镰刀、锄头、喷雾器等农具的板车，把这些亲手作的东西送给农民。前一天，解放手工业社工人宣章德和三个助手就赶制镰刀和锄头，忙了一天。他们说：送给农民兄弟的礼物要使他们用起来称心满意。他们让每一锻件都炼到确到好处才出炉，每一锤都打得又稳又平。他们把打好的镰刀破例地磨了一遍又一遍。晚饭以后，老木工张学林还不休息，又工作了三个多钟头。由木工、锻工等六个工种六十多个工人组成的修配组，也早就准备好了全副工具，去为农民修理农具及家庭用物。
    在河畔一个广场上，像市场一样地热闹起来了，工人们一到广场就忙着升火炉，安装鼓风机。农业社社员们从四面八方像赶集一样赶来向工人问好致意。有些农民带着需要修理的铁锹、锄头、镰刀、面盆、茶壶、剪刀、木盆，请工人修理，叮当的铁锤声、嚓嚓的磨刀声、哗哗的锯木声响成一片。工人和农民相互问候，孩子们欢天喜地地跑来跑去，争看热闹。工人们耐心地把成堆的破旧用物，一件一件修补焊接。锻工们每锻好一把锄头、铁锹，都要问：“这样行不行？”修焊工人小组每修好一个茶壶、一个面盆，都有专人把它仔细地放在水里试验。只要发现有一点小砂眼，就随即重新修焊。
    高桥农业社和梅家廊农业社的社长，代表社员接受了工人们送的礼物，感谢工人为他们修好了许多农具和用具。他们还向工人们介绍了农业生产情况。这两个社1956年曾遭到三次大水、两次台风灾害。高桥社社长说：“我们社遭灾后，生活、生产都有困难，但是比起合作化以前还是好得多，不像过去了，现在有困难我们也有可能、有信心去克服它。”他们介绍在合作化以前，有一年遭到水灾，梅家廊二十六户人家有二十五户流离外乡，而去年遭灾后，这两个社都没有一户外出逃荒。相反地，他们积极地开展了副业和农业生产，并且争取麦子产量达到1955年最大的丰收年产量，即每亩二百斤到三百斤。
    这天，工人们也到受灾的社员家里作了慰问。
    当晚，工人们在秦淮河畔向农民们告别。工农友谊将像秦淮河水一样永远地流着，流着。
