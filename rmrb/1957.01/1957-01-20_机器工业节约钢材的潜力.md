Xinhua News Agency, January 19th: (Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Minghui reports) China's machine industry has enormous potential for saving steel and other metal materials. According to estimates from relevant sources, if widespread and in-depth conservation efforts are carried out, the current tight supply of metal materials for production in the machine industry this year can be greatly alleviated, and it is possible to produce more technical equipment for various sectors of the national economy.

The basic situation of metal material usage in China's machine industry is currently: on the one hand, the supply of steel and other metal materials for production cannot meet the needs, and some enterprises are threatened with shutdown; on the other hand, there are serious cases of unreasonable use of steel in product design and production, wasting a large amount of steel. Therefore, vigorously saving metal materials, especially steel, has become the most effective way for the machine industry to solve the current difficulty of steel shortage.

Reports from various sources indicate that a large amount of steel can be saved by improving product design structure and reducing machine weight. In recent years, Chinese designers have made significant achievements in product design, but many machines are not designed economically enough, with excessively large safety factors. Many surveyed machines are 10% to 15% heavier than the actual products. In addition, many product blueprints are old ones from decades ago, and machines produced according to these blueprints are much heavier than similar machines produced abroad today. The weight of these machines can be greatly reduced. Recently, many enterprises in Shenyang, Shanghai, Wuxi, and other places have made partial modifications to the design of certain products, reducing the machine weight by about 10%, and in some cases even more than 20%. If all enterprises across the country universally value and carry out this work, give encouragement and support to designers, conduct scientific analysis and research, and arrive at reasonable and possible net weights, then, while ensuring machine quality and safety, simply improving design alone can save the country tens of thousands of tons of steel.

Another important aspect of saving steel is to adopt advanced technology and reduce metal loss during the production process. According to estimates from relevant sources, the metal material utilization rate of China's machine industry is only about 65%, while the metal material utilization rate of the Soviet machine industry has reached about 80%. This means that to produce the same amount of machines, China consumes about 15% more steel and other metal materials than the Soviet Union. Some enterprises have even lower steel utilization rates. According to statistics from the First Ministry of Machine Building on thirty types of machine tool products, the utilization rate of forged steel is only 44.3%, and the utilization rate of shaped steel is only 48.5%, with some products having a steel utilization rate of only about 37%. If metal processing methods are improved and the metal material utilization rate is increased by an average of 5% to 10%, the country can save 60,000 to over 100,000 tons of metal materials this year.

The differences in the amount of steel consumed by similar enterprises producing the same type of product also show the huge potential for savings in the machine industry's processing. In the first three quarters of 1956, the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory consumed an average of twenty-eight tons more steel materials per locomotive than the Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory, while the material consumption of certain components of the locomotives produced by the Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory was higher than that of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory. A machine tool produced by the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory consumes an average of 0.3 tons more steel material per unit than the same type of machine tool produced by the Dalian Machine Tool Factory. If the material consumption per locomotive at the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory reaches the level of the Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory, it can save one thousand several hundred tons of steel materials based on this year's output. According to relevant sources, this situation of different steel consumption for the same type of product is relatively common throughout the country.

Strengthening the recovery and utilization of scrap metal, reducing the scrap rate, and appropriately using substitutes are also of great significance for saving metal materials. Taking the chips, material ends, and discarded remnants left over after machine industry processing as an example, there are approximately hundreds of thousands of tons each year, many of which are not recovered in time and deteriorate, and many can be directly used in the production of some enterprises but are not utilized. Therefore, strengthening the recovery and management of scrap and remnants, comprehensively planning the utilization of scrap and remnants to replace whole materials, will also save a considerable amount of metal materials each year.

A problem related to saving metal materials in the machine industry is how the metallurgical industry departments can find ways to increase the specifications of steel to meet the needs of machine processing, while gradually improving the strength and quality of steel. Solving this problem will create favorable conditions for the machine industry departments to reduce the use of large materials for small purposes, improve the utilization rate of steel, and reduce the weight of machines. Producing steel with specifications that meet processing needs also requires the strong cooperation of the machine industry departments.

The steel consumed by China's machine industry each year accounts for about 65% of the country's total steel consumption, making it one of the largest steel-consuming sectors. Therefore, carrying out the work of saving metal materials in the machine industry is an important link in alleviating China's tight steel supply this year and ensuring that the machine industry produces more technical equipment for the national economy. At the same time, through conservation efforts, the design level and technical management level of the machine industry will also be greatly improved.

### 机器工业节约钢材的潜力

    机器工业节约钢材的潜力
    新华社19日讯　新华社记者孙铭惠报道：我国机器工业在钢材和其他金属材料节约方面有着巨大的潜力。据有关方面估计，如果广泛深入地开展节约工作，机器工业今年生产中金属材料供应紧张的情况就可以大大缓和，并且有可能为国民经济各部门增产更多的技术装备。
    目前我国机器工业金属材料使用方面的基本情况是：一方面生产用钢材和其他金属材料供应不能满足需要，某些企业受到停产的威胁；另一方面在产品设计和生产中却有严重的钢材使用不合理的情况，浪费了大量钢材。因此，大力节约金属材料特别是钢材，就成为机器工业当前解决钢材不足这一困难的一个最有效的办法。
    各方面反映的情况表明，从改进产品设计结构、减轻机器重量方面可以节约大量钢材。几年来我国设计人员在产品设计中已经做出了显著的成绩，但是有许多机器设计得不够经济，安全系数过大，不少测绘的机器要比实样重10％到15％。另外还有不少产品的图纸都是十几年前甚至几十年前的老图纸，按照这些图纸生产的机器，要比目前国外生产的同类机器重得多。这些机器的重量是有可能大大减轻的。最近，沈阳、上海、无锡等地不少企业对某些产品的设计作了部分修改，就使机器重量减轻10％左右，有的甚至减轻20％以上。假如全国各企业普遍重视和开展这一工作，给设计人员以鼓励和支持，进行科学的分析研究，得出合理而又可能的净重，那么在保证机器质量和安全的情况下，单是改进设计一项就可以为国家节约几万吨钢材。
    节约钢材的另一个重要方面是采用先进的工艺，减少生产过程中的金属损耗。据有关方面估计，我国机器工业金属材料利用率只有65％左右，而苏联机器工业金属材料利用率已经达到80％左右，这就是说，生产同样多的机器，我国要比苏联多消耗15％左右的钢材和其他金属材料。有些企业钢材利用率甚至还要低。据第一机械工业部就三十种机床产品的统计，锻钢材利用率只有44.3％，型钢材利用率只有48.5％，其中有的产品的钢材利用率仅达37％左右。如果改进金属加工方法，把金属材料利用率平均提高5％到10％，全国今年就可以节约金属材料六万吨到十多万吨。
    从各个同类企业生产的同类型产品而消耗的钢材数量不同的情况，也可以看出机器工业加工过程中还有节约的巨大潜力。大连机车车辆制造工厂1956年前三个季度生产的机车，平均每台要比四方机车车辆制造工厂多耗用二十八吨钢铁材料，而四方机车车辆制造工厂生产的机车的某些部件材料消耗又比大连机车车辆制造工厂高。沈阳第一机床厂生产的一种机床，要比大连机床厂生产的同类型机床平均每台多耗用钢铁材料零点三吨。若是大连机车车辆制造工厂每台机车材料消耗达到四方机车车辆制造工厂的水平，按今年产量计算就可以节约一千几百吨钢铁材料。据有关方面说，这种同类型产品消耗钢材数量不一样的情况，在全国来说，是比较普遍存在的。
    加强废金属的回收和利用，降低废品率，适当地采用代用品，对节约金属材料也有很大意义。以机器工业加工以后剩下的切屑、料头和报废的残料来说，每年大约有几十万吨，其中有不少没有及时回收而变质，不少可以直接用在一些企业的生产上而没有利用。因此，加强废料、残料的回收管理，全盘筹划对废料、残料的利用，以代替整料，每年节约的金属材料也将是相当可观的。
    同机器工业节约金属材料相关联的一个问题，是冶金工业部门如何设法增加钢材的规格，来满足机器加工的需要，同时逐步提高钢材的强度和质量。解决这个问题，将为机器工业部门减少大材小用、提高钢材利用率、减轻机器重量创造有利条件。生产符合加工需要的规格的钢材，也需要机器工业部门的有力的配合。
    我国机器工业每年消耗的钢材，占全国生产用钢材消耗量65％左右，是钢材消耗量最大的部门之一。因此，在机器工业中开展节约金属材料的工作，是缓和我国今年钢材供应紧张、保证机器工业为国民经济增产更多的技术装备的一个重要环节。同时通过节约工作，也将大大提高机器工业的设计水平和技术管理水平。
