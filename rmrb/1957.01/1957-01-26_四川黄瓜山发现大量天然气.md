Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 24th: Two wells in the Huangguashan oil exploration area of Yongchuan County, Sichuan Province, have recently discovered large quantities of natural gas and white condensate gas oil. After gas testing, it has been confirmed that these two wells are currently the largest natural gas wells with industrial value in Sichuan. One of the wells has a daily natural gas production of more than 490,000 cubic meters, which is larger than the production of existing gas wells in the Longchang Gas Mine and Qijiang Carbon Black Plant in Sichuan.
　　The Huangguashan oil exploration area was newly opened last year. Among the five wells that have been drilled, all have experienced natural gas eruptions of varying degrees of intensity.

    四川黄瓜山发现大量天然气
    新华社成都24日电　四川省永川县黄瓜山石油探区有两口井，最近先后发现大量的天然气和白色凝折气油。经过试气，已经证实这两口井是目前四川最大的具有工业价值的天然气井，其中一口井每天的天然气产量有四十九万多立方公尺，比四川隆昌气矿和綦江碳黑场现有生产气井的产量都大。
    黄瓜山石油探区是在去年新开辟的。在已经钻探的五口井中，都先后发生强烈程度不一的天然气喷。
