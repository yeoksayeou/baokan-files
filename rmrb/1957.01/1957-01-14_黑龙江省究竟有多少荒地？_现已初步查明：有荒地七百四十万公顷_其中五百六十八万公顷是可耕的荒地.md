Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 13th: Through the efforts of the land survey personnel of the Heilongjiang Provincial Land Utilization Bureau, a preliminary investigation has been made to determine the exact area of wasteland in the province. People have always believed that Heilongjiang Province has only more than 6.6 million hectares (100 million mu) of wasteland. However, after actual surveying and calculation using precise methods, the province has 7.4 million hectares of wasteland, which is 400,000 hectares more than the existing cultivated land area in the province. Among these wastelands, except for 1.72 million hectares of saline-alkali land that cannot be reclaimed at present, the remaining 5.68 million hectares of wasteland are arable. Some require drainage and soil improvement, while others can be cultivated without any technical measures. In 1956, the state had already allocated 1.58 million hectares of wasteland to newly built and expanded state-owned farms, immigrants, and farmers for cultivation.

In the past year, nearly 30,000 surveyors and construction workers from the Heilongjiang Provincial Land Utilization Bureau, the Department of Agriculture, the Harbin Water Conservancy Design Institute of the Ministry of Water Resources, and the Heilongjiang Provincial Geological Bureau were distributed in the Heilongjiang River Basin, the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains, and the Wanda Mountains to carry out surveying and basic construction work. They traversed the province's forests, rivers, and wilderness. The largest team, with 16,700 people from the Forestry Department, built roads, erected telephone lines, and established 190 forest management stations in the three major forest areas of Heilongjiang Province. The workers engaged in construction in the Greater Khingan Mountains built a forest road hundreds of kilometers long from Nenjiang to the northernmost part of our country, as well as two highway branch lines. Some areas of the Greater Khingan Mountains are now accessible by car and telephone. This has created favorable conditions for the exploitation of the forests in the Greater Khingan Mountains and the nurturing and renewal of the forest area.

The surveyors of the Harbin Water Conservancy Design Institute of the Ministry of Water Resources, who are solving the problem of swamp drainage in the area north of Xingkai Lake, south of Wanda Mountain, west of the Ussuri River, and upstream of the Heilongjiang River, also made some achievements last year.

    黑龙江省究竟有多少荒地？
    现已初步查明：有荒地七百四十万公顷
    其中五百六十八万公顷是可耕的荒地
    新华社哈尔滨13日电　经过黑龙江省土地利用局勘测人员的努力，已经初步查明全省究竟有多少荒地面积。一向人们都认为黑龙江省只有六百六十多万公顷（一亿亩）荒地，但是经过实际勘测和用精密方法计算的结果，全省有荒地七百四十万公顷，比全省现有的耕地面积还多四十万公顷。在这些荒地中，除了一百七十二万公顷的盐碱地目前还不能开垦以外，其余五百六十八万公顷的荒地都是可耕荒地，有的要加以排水和改良土壤，有的不加任何技术措施就可以垦殖。在1956年内，国家已经拨出其中的一百五十八万公顷荒地，交给新建和扩建的国营农场、移民和农民开垦用。
    去年一年，黑龙江省土地利用局、农业厅、水利部哈尔滨水利设计院和黑龙江省地质局等单位，一共有近三万名的勘测人员和基本建设工人，分布在黑龙江流域，大、小兴安岭和完达山脉，进行勘测和基本建设工作。他们踏遍了全省的森林、河川和荒野。规模最大的拥有一万六千七百人的林业厅的勘测人员和基本建设队伍，在黑龙江省的三大林区里修筑了公路，架设了电话，并且建立了一百九十个森林经营所。在大兴安岭里进行建设的工人们，修筑了一条由嫩江到我国最北端的一条长达几百公里的森林公路和两条公路支线。现在的大兴安岭，已经有一部分地区通汽车和通电话了。这就为大兴安岭森林的开采和林区的抚育更新工作，创造了良好的条件。
    在兴凯湖以北，完达山以南，乌苏里江以西和黑龙江上游地带解决沼泽地排水问题的水利部哈尔滨水利设计院的勘测人员，去年也获得了一些成就。
