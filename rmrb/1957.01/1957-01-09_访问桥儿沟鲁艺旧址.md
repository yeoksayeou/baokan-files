Leaving Yan'an city to the east, one sees undulating mountains, the winding Yan River, and thriving, orderly fields of millet, rice, watermelon, and potatoes in the river valley, while wild lily flowers sway in the breeze on the cliffs. Arriving at Qia'ergou, the car stops, and a group of innocent and lively children swarm around us, while many elderly and young people eagerly shake our hands, and women welcome the guests from Beijing with kind and joyful eyes.

"We are very happy that you have come back!" Branch Secretary Zhao Buxi spoke while shaking our hands. He was about fifty years old, with a dark red face, wearing a white cloth vest and earth-yellow cloth trousers, his eyes shining brightly.

"This is Deputy Director Zhao Lianyu," Zhao Buxi said, pointing to a young man of medium height in his twenties standing next to him.

Everyone was invited to rest in the agricultural cooperative's office at the entrance of the village. Just as we sat down, the children at the door scattered, and a dark and fat old man walked in, wearing a blue cloth suit and a white towel wrapped around his head.

"This is Old Mu, the township head," Zhao Buxi stood up and offered him a seat.

"They are from Beijing!"

"From Beijing! Has Zhou Yang come?" Old Mu, the township head, asked excitedly, as if seeing a relative.

"Zhou Yang didn't come, but a letter did, and he also brought us a whole set of Yangko instruments!" Zhao Buxi replied with a smile to Old Mu's question.

A burst of gongs and drums resounded in the village. Zhao Buxi said, "The last time we wrote back to Comrade Zhou Yang, we said that we lacked nothing here except Yangko instruments, and he really brought these things. With Yangko instruments, cultural and recreational activities will be much easier." Zhao Buxi was about to continue speaking when Old Mu, the township head, interrupted him, saying, "How are Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu doing? They often came here in the past, and we used to eat and talk together."

As they talked, they mentioned the Lu Xun Academy of Arts. Old Mu, the township head, smiled and said, "We all cried when the Lu Xun Academy of Arts left. When they were here, if we had any difficulties, they would definitely help us solve them. We performed Yangko dances and plays, and the students of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts often came to help and guide us!" At this time, Zhao Lianyu patted Li Yongnian, a farmer sitting next to him, and said, "Let me introduce him, he is the actor who played the old woman in 'Little Sister-in-Law'." Everyone laughed.

Qia'ergou is located on the north bank of the Yan River, and the highway to Yulin passes through the village, with many pedestrians and vehicles resting here. Zhao Buxi pointed to the green and yellow fields south of the village and told us, "Look, that's where the teachers and students of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts used to farm. We used to work together there."

Along the small stream lined with green grass and trees, across a log bridge, we entered a stone-built arched gate, and Zhao Lianyu pointed to the houses at the foot of the mountain ahead and said, "This is where the students of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts used to attend classes." There, the commune members were threshing in the hot sun. A row of cave dwellings facing east on the west side of the threshing ground used to be student dormitories, and now a new tractor station has been built. Further on, we saw rows of cave dwellings and small houses, which were where the music, art, and drama departments of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts lived. It was here that many outstanding works such as "The White Haired Girl," "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland," and "The Yellow River Cantata" were produced. The world-famous film "The White Haired Girl" was also filmed on a small hill nearby.

At noon, Zhao Buxi invited us to eat at his home. His house was located on a hillside, the courtyard was very clean, and a brand-new five-color large floral blanket was spread on the kang (platform bed) in the room.

It was a very satisfying lunch. All the dishes were local specialties of northern Shaanxi. Even more attractive was the miscellaneous noodle, which was made so thin and long that it was almost transparent, and as long as vermicelli. Even machines couldn't make it like that. Everyone couldn't help but praise our hostess's skillful hands, considering it simply a folk art.

During the meal, Zhao Buxi told us that in the past, whenever it was the New Year, the comrades of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts would always hold a get-together for the villagers. They had very good feelings for the people of Qia'ergou, and everyone was very casual with them. When they went to the village to pay New Year's greetings, they drank and had fun with everyone. Once, Comrade Zhou Yang didn't drink, and several farmers held his head, grabbed his ears, and forced him to drink.

The Lu Xun Academy of Arts left such a deep impression in the memories of the farmers of Qia'ergou. Therefore, when Qia'ergou established a cooperative, it named the cooperative "Yifeng Agricultural Production Cooperative." Now, almost everyone in the village has joined the cooperative.

To the comrades who once lived in Qia'ergou, I would also like to bring you the greetings from the villagers of Qia'ergou! Let us forever remember those memorable days!

    访问桥儿沟鲁艺旧址
    刘云璨
    出延安城东去，便见山峦起伏，延河蜿蜒，川地里谷子、稻子、西瓜、马铃薯长得茁壮整齐，崖畔上野百合花迎风摇摆。到了桥儿沟，汽车一停，一群天真烂漫的孩子蜂拥到跟前，许多老年人、青年人争着同我们握手，妇女们以亲切愉快的眼光来欢迎北京来的客人。
    “你们回来，我们喜欢的很！”支部书记赵步喜一面和我们握手一面讲话。他有五十来岁年纪，黑红脸皮，上着白布背心，下穿土黄布裤，双目炯炯有神。
    “这是副社长赵连玉同志。”赵步喜指着身旁一位中等身材二十几岁的年青人说。
    大家被让到村口农业社办公室里休息。刚刚坐下，门口的孩子们一闪，一位又黑又胖的老汉走了进来，他一身蓝布衣服，头上扎一条白洋肚子手巾。
      “这是老穆乡长。”赵步喜站起来，让给他一个坐。
      “他们是北京来的！”
    “北京来的！周扬来啦？”老穆乡长像见到亲人了似的，兴奋地问。
      “周扬没来，信来了，他还给咱们带来一大套秧歌家什呢！”赵步喜笑着回答了老穆乡长的问话。
    村子里一阵锣鼓喧天。赵步喜说：“我们上次给周扬同志回信说我们这里什么不缺，就缺少秧歌家什，他当真地把这些东西拿来了。有了秧歌家什文娱活动就好办了。”赵步喜还要讲下去，老穆乡长打断了他的话说：“毛主席、朱总司令还好吗？他们过去也常到这里来，我们曾在一起吃过饭，谈过话。”
    谈着谈着，就说起鲁艺。老穆乡长笑了笑，说道：“鲁艺离开的时候，我们都哭了。他们在这里，我们有什么困难，一定帮助解决，我们扭秧歌、演剧，鲁艺的学生们还经常来帮助指导哩！”这时赵连玉拍着坐在旁边的一位农民李永年说：“介绍一下，他就是当年演‘小姑贤’里老婆的演员。”大家都笑了。
    桥儿沟在延河北岸，到榆林去的公路，穿街而过，来往行人、车辆，多在这里休息。赵步喜指着村南一带绿黄色的田野告诉我们，瞧：“那是鲁艺师生们种地的地方，那时候我们在一起劳动过。”
    沿着两边长满青草树木的小溪，跨过独木桥，进了一座石砌的拱形大门，赵连玉指着迎面山下的房屋说：“这是鲁艺学生们过去上课的地方。”那里，社员们正在火热的太阳下碾场，场西面一排门向东的大窑洞，过去是学生宿舍，现在新建了一个拖拉机站。再过去，我们看到一排排的窑洞和小屋，便是鲁艺音乐系、美术系、戏剧系住的地方。就在这里，曾经产生了“白毛女”、“兄妹开荒”、“黄河大合唱”等等许多出色的作品。在附近的一个小山头上，还曾摄制过世界闻名的“白毛女”电影片。
    中午，赵步喜留我们在他家吃饭。他家住在半山坡，院子里收拾得十分干净，室内炕上铺着一条崭新的五色大花毛毯。
    这是一次非常满意的午餐。几个菜全是陕北乡间特产。更吸引人的是杂面条，赶的又薄又长，薄得透明，长得像粉条，就是机器也轧不成那个样子。大家禁不住一齐称赞我们女主人的手头灵巧。认为简直是一种民间艺术品。
    吃饭的时候，赵步喜告诉我们：以前每逢过年的时候，鲁艺的同志总要给村中人联欢。他们和桥儿沟的人感情好的很，大家对他们一点不客气，他们到村中去拜年，跟大家饮酒取乐。有一回，周扬同志不喝酒，几个农民就按着他的头，捉着耳朵，强迫灌酒喝。
    鲁艺学院就是这样地在桥儿沟的农民们记忆里留下了深刻的印象，所以，当桥儿沟成立合作社的时候，就把社名定为“艺丰农业生产合作社”。现在全村基本上都参加了合作社了。
    曾经在桥儿沟生活过的同志们，我也顺便把桥儿沟的老乡们的问候带给你们！让我们永远记住那些值得记忆的日子吧！
