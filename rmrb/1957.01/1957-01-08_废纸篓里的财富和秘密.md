    In the lobby of the office building of the State Planning Commission and the State Economic Commission, an exhibition was recently held of some of the wealth and secret documents that Wang Desheng salvaged from wastepaper baskets in 1956, marking his twentieth year of participation in the revolution. The exhibits are categorized into thirty-four types, totaling more than five thousand six hundred items.

    Among the exhibits, many are items that people replaced with newer models or simply discarded as old and useless. Like those five staplers, each worth more than six yuan, piles of penholders, colored chalk, and erasers, like those inkpads, meter sticks, shuttlecocks, and brightly colored Jianzi (Chinese shuttlecock) and so on. Some things seem to have slipped through the fingers of those who are "extravagant," like the three thousand-plus staples and thumbtacks that Wang Desheng picked out from the wastepaper like "searching for a needle in the ocean." However, some things seem to have been thrown away by people for reasons unknown, like the intact volleyball net, three good ping-pong rackets, a barely used jump rope, nine teacups, twenty-one boxes of paper clips, whole sheets and books of office and telegraph paper, and stacks of official letterhead and envelopes that can also be found among the exhibits. Seeing these, one cannot help but think that if there were another big swindler like Li Wanming forging documents, they would not need to steal; they could simply find the official envelopes and letterhead of such a large organization from the wastepaper baskets of these two agencies.

    Among the exhibits, there are also stamps used for sending documents to various agencies, engraved with "Secret Document," "First Ministry," "Second Ministry" (First Ministry of Machine Building, Second Ministry of Machine Building), "Transfer to Third Office," "Transfer to Fourth Office" (Third and Fourth Offices of the State Council), and so on.

    Most surprisingly, seventy-two copies of documents printed with "Internal Publication, For Reference Only, Keep Confidential" were also picked up from the wastepaper basket. According to the reporter's understanding, this kind of publication is only for cadres at the bureau level and above to read in these two agencies. The day before this interview, Wang Desheng also picked out more than forty internal materials from the wastepaper pile, including the meeting records of the director and members of the State Economic Commission, and important economic intelligence such as the national 1957 material distribution situation.

    Wang Desheng is a staff member of the Administrative Section of the State Planning Commission. He joined the Red Army twenty-one years ago, serving as a feeder, cook, and deputy squad leader in the combat squad. He shed blood in battle; during the Great Production Movement in Yan'an, he was elected as a labor hero of the organs directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The certificate of merit made of ordinary cloth printed with Chairman Mao's inscription, which he won that time, is still treasured as a source of encouragement.

    Wang Desheng has participated in the revolution for twenty years, but he has not rested on his laurels. Today, he is still happily cleaning the ordinary or confidential wastepaper sent from hundreds of offices of the State Planning Commission and the State Economic Commission from morning to night in a small room in the basement of the nine-story building. The exhibits on display are some of the useful things he has cleaned out of the wastepaper.

    Wang Desheng said, "I am fifty-one years old, and I am very content with this work. This is also managing the country." "Managing the country" is not Wang Desheng's self-consolation. When he discovered the waste phenomenon in the agencies from the wastepaper basket, he made suggestions to the administrative section, requesting civil servants to pay attention when cleaning the rooms. He has also reported the waste situation of the agencies to the Party group leader more than once. His thought and action of "managing the country" have attracted the attention of the leading comrades of these two agencies. The comrades of the Party committee and the general office went to the warehouse to see the things he had collected and decided to exhibit them to educate everyone to be diligent and frugal.

    Now, the State Planning Commission and the State Economic Commission have decided to basically suspend the issuance of office supplies for two months, and appropriate measures are being taken to address the confidentiality issues.

    废纸篓里的财富和秘密
    新华社记者　李峰
    在国家计划委员会和国家经济委员会办公大楼的门厅内，最近展出了王德胜参加革命第二十年——1956年从废纸篓里拣出来的一部分财富和密件。这些展品，以类计共三十四种，以数计共五千六百多件。
    在展品中，有很多是人们领新代旧、以旧作废的东西。像那每个价值六元多的五个钉书器，成堆的沾水笔杆、彩色粉笔和橡皮，像那印色盒、米突尺、羽毛球和色彩鲜艳的板羽球等等。有些东西，看来是从“大手大脚”的人们的手缝里漏掉的，像王德胜“海底捞针”似地一个一个地从废纸里拣出来的三千多个书钉和大头针。但是，也有些东西，看来是有人不知为什么从手中扔掉的，像展品中那个完整无损的排球网，三个很好的乒乓球拍子，几乎没有用过的跳绳，九个茶杯，二十一盒曲别针，整张整本的办公和电报用纸，成叠的公函用纸和信封，也可以从展品中找到。看到这些，不禁使人想到，如果再有大骗子李万铭之流伪造证件，他们不必偷窃，只要从这两个机关的废纸篓中，就能找到这样大机关的公用信封信纸。
    在展品中，还有向各机关发送文件用的戳记，上面刻着“密件”“一机”“二机”（第一机械工业部，第二机械工业部）“转三办”“转四办”（国务院第三办公室和第四办公室）等等。
    最使人惊奇的是七十二本印有“内部刊物，仅供参考，注意保密”字样的文件，也是从废纸篓拣来的。据记者了解，这种刊物，在这两个机关仅供局长以上干部阅读。在记者这次采访的前一天，王德胜还从废纸堆里拣出了四十多份内部材料，其中有国家经济委员会主任和委员们开会的记录，有全国1957年物资分配的情况等重要的经济情报。
    王德胜是国家计划委员会行政科的科员，二十一年前就参加了红军，当饲养员、炊事员和战斗班的副班长。在战斗中，他流过鲜血；在延安大生产运动中，他曾当选为中共中央直属机关的劳动英雄，那次他荣获用普通布制的印有毛主席题字的奖状，至今还作为鼓舞他的力量珍藏着。
    王德胜参加革命二十年，他并没有以功臣自居，今天他始终愉快地在九层大楼的地下室的一个小房间，从朝到夕，清理国家计划委员会和国家经济委员会数以百计的办公室送来的一般废纸或保密废纸，展出的展品，就是他从废纸中清理出来的一部分有用的东西。
    王德胜说：“我五十一岁了，我很安心这工作，这也是管理国家的工作。”“管理国家的工作”，这话并不是王德胜的自慰，当他从废纸篓里发现机关的浪费现象的时候，他就向行政科提意见，要求公务员们打扫房间时注意些。他还不止一次地向党小组长汇报机关的浪费情况。他这种要“管理国家”的思想和行动，引起了这两个机关领导同志的注意，党委和办公厅的同志到仓库看了他收集起来的东西，决定展览出来，教育大家勤俭节约。
    现在国家计划委员会和国家经济委员会已经决定，基本上停发两个月的办公用具，对保密问题正在作适当处理。
