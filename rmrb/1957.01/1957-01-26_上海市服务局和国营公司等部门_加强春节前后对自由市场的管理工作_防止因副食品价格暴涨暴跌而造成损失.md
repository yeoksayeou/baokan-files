Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 23rd - Various New Year goods prepared for Shanghai residents, such as dried bamboo shoots, vermicelli, preserved meat, and New Year cakes, have begun to appear on the market, and the arrival volume of non-staple foods in free markets is also gradually increasing. In the first twenty days of this month, the arrival volume of live chickens, fresh eggs, fresh fish, beef, etc., at the Dada Wharf and North Railway Station free markets increased by 1.7 times compared to the same period last month.

Currently, market prices are mostly stable, with only a few commodities such as eggs and grass carp showing an upward trend in free market prices. The Shanghai Service Bureau has announced the highest negotiated prices for various major non-staple foods from January 22nd to February 4th to prevent undue losses to consumers, farmers, and small vendors due to sharp rises and falls in prices.

State-owned companies and relevant departments are currently conducting widespread publicity and education among small vendors and farmers, urging them to consciously abide by supply measures and refrain from illegal activities such as raising prices, cornering the market, short-weighing, adulteration, and selling substandard goods. People's committees in districts such as Yu Garden, Huangpu, and Putuo have also convened meetings of relevant departments such as taxation, health, and public security, or organized special working groups, to strengthen the management and hygiene inspection of free markets within their districts.

    加强春节前后对自由市场的管理工作
    防止因副食品价格暴涨暴跌而造成损失
    新华社上海23日电　为上海市居民准备的笋干、粉丝、腌腊、年糕等各种年货已开始应市，自由市场副食品到货量也在逐渐增加。在这个月的前二十天中，大达码头和北火车站两个自由市场的毛鸡、鲜蛋、鲜鱼、牛肉等到货量比上月同期增加一点七倍。
    目前市场价格大部平稳，只有鸡蛋、青鱼等少数商品的自由市场价格有上涨趋势。上海市服务局已公布1月22日到2月4日间各种主要副食品的最高议价，以防止因价格暴涨暴跌而造成消费者、农民和小商贩不应有的损失。
    国营公司和各有关部门现正对小商小贩和农民普遍进行宣传教育，要他们自觉遵守供应办法，不作抬价、套购、缺斤、掺杂、售卖变质商品等违法行为。邑庙、黄浦、普陀等区的人民委员会也先后召开税务、卫生、公安等有关部门会议，或组织专门的工作组，来加强区内自由市场的管理和卫生检查工作。
