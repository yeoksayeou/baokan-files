In the years since the founding of New China, the demand for studying philosophy has been increasing day by day, but the demand for studying the history of philosophy has lagged far behind. Doesn't studying dialectical materialism without integrating it with the history of Western philosophy somewhat contradict the Marxist historical viewpoint?

In the past two or three years, this method of studying philosophy has been changing. Now, not only have comprehensive universities universally opened courses in the history of philosophy (for example, the Foreign Philosophy History Teaching and Research Section of the Philosophy Department of Peking University has opened three classes of different grades in the history of philosophy this academic year), but, as far as we know, cadre schools such as the Central Communist Youth League School and cultural institutions such as the China Youth Publishing House are also conducting studies of the history of philosophy. This is a very good change. However, with this change, some questions about studying the history of philosophy have arisen. I would like to offer some opinions on these questions for the reference of comrades who are studying the history of philosophy.

First, I would like to talk about how to focus on studying the history of philosophy. Before and after the Party and the government put forward the academic policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, there were incorrect aspects to the views on this issue. Before the blooming of a hundred flowers, the focus of studying the history of philosophy was placed on materialist schools or materialist philosophers, and only extremely simple mentions were made of philosophical schools or philosophers other than materialism. If teachers lectured on the ideological systems of these philosophers in a relatively objective and systematic way, they would be regarded as "doing obligatory propaganda for bourgeois reactionary ideas." After the blooming of a hundred flowers, in the eyes of some people, the focus of studying the history of philosophy seemed to shift to idealist schools and idealist philosophers. Some comrades even believed that only the "detailed" theories of idealism could make people feel "satisfied" and "enjoy" it; materialist philosophers were not popular objects in the selection of graduation thesis topics; even among individual students in the first year of the philosophy department, Plato's dialogues were their favorite readings.

What kind of effect will this focused study of the history of philosophy have? Either, as our teaching experience in the past few years has told us: we only learn a little about the basic viewpoints, main conclusions, and extremely simple processes of how certain views lead to certain conclusions of idealist schools and idealist philosophers. We only know that a certain philosopher is an objective idealist or a subjective idealist, or an agnostic. A more systematic understanding of the ideological content of these philosophers is out of the question. Or, as was commonly held before liberation regarding the historical significance of materialism and idealism, the idealist philosophical tradition was simply the highest expression of human thought and culture, while materialism only played a negative role in the development of philosophy and science; materialist philosophy was not worth learning in terms of either worldview or epistemology. I can say with certainty that the effect of studying the history of philosophy in this way is not only not what we hope for today, but must be avoided.

In my opinion, in order to avoid the recurrence of such adverse effects in the study of the history of philosophy, it is best that we do not simply follow the difference between materialism and idealism, but rather follow the standards of various philosophical schools and philosophers with different and varying influences in the history of philosophy to determine the focus of studying the history of philosophy. In fact, to achieve the basic requirements of studying the history of philosophy, it should be done this way. We can't think that someone who only knows Democritus and not Plato, only knows Berkeley or Hume and not Bacon or Hobbes, only knows 18th-century French materialism and not 19th-century German idealism has mastered the knowledge of the history of philosophy well, right?

This focused study of the history of philosophy not only does not have the problem of objectivism, but also conforms to the Marxist study method of seeking truth from facts. Because materialist philosophy has developed from the struggle with idealism; although the struggle between these two different worldviews is clear-cut in the history of philosophy, there is only one object in terms of the object of their struggle. The struggle between materialism and idealism occurs only when there are different views on the same object (for example, if the objective existence affirmed by Democritus and the material existence denied by Plato are not directed at the same object, then what is the struggle between the Democritus line and the Plato line?). Therefore, the more comprehensive and detailed our understanding of this struggle process, the more we will feel that the history of the development of materialism is rich in content and of great significance.

Secondly, I would like to talk about how to study the history of philosophy in conjunction with the socio-historical background. The history of philosophy is the history of the development of various philosophical viewpoints, and various philosophical viewpoints ideologically reflect the specific circumstances of the socio-material living conditions and class struggles of a certain period. Therefore, if we want to objectively and scientifically understand the historical development process of philosophy in a certain period, we must adopt the Marxist historical viewpoint. Idealist philosophers, in order to obliterate the objective laws of philosophical development, always advocate the so-called absolute independence of thought, the saying that thought produces thought. Indeed, if we do not examine the development of idealist philosophy from a historical perspective but solely from the absolute independence of thought, it will be easy to fall into the circle of idealism. The most touching point of idealist philosophers lies solely in their "detailed" ideological systems; within this system, so-called ideas, sense consciousness, and "absolute spirit" seem to undoubtedly dominate the entire material world and social existence. However, if we ask, why do concrete things imitate ideas? Why must objective existence depend on the subject? Why is the development of history the embodiment of "absolute spirit"? Regarding these questions, I think that whether it is Plato, Berkeley, or Hegel, they cannot answer without abandoning their set of "detailed" theories. Regarding these questions, we can only return to the historical conditions and class relations reflected by their philosophies, and after specific analysis, can we obtain scientific answers and correct understanding.

Studying philosophy must of course be combined with the social and historical background of the time, but at the same time, the relative independence of philosophical thought and its certain continuity of development cannot be ignored. The so-called relative independence of philosophical thought means that although philosophy ideologically reflects the viewpoints of various class societies, this reflection has formed a unique form due to the influence of previously passed down thinking materials and ideological methods. Therefore, whether we are studying materialist or idealist philosophers, we must firmly grasp the formation process and specific content of this ideological form in order to achieve a correct understanding of them. If we ignore this point and attempt to simply derive various different arguments or conclusions from the socio-historical background or class relations, then it will not only not help in studying the history of philosophy, but also repeat the ideological method of vulgarizing historical materialism that Lenin sharply criticized. But today, there are still comrades who study the history of philosophy in this way. When he studied Aristotle's theory of four causes, he tried to discover in the book "Ancient Greece" which class interests the material cause and efficient cause represented, and which class relations the formal cause and final cause reflected. Although this comrade put a lot of effort into this, the result was that his understanding of Aristotle did not become clearer, and on the contrary, Aristotle made him feel "extremely headache" day by day.

Aristotle made this comrade feel "extremely headache", and Aristotle absolutely cannot bear any responsibility, because he did not ask this comrade to go directly to his ancestors; he wants people to understand philosophical thought from his works such as "Metaphysics" and "Physics". Aristotle's philosophy was not formed from his mother's womb, but was produced by his inheritance of Plato's thought and its critical absorption. In studying the history of philosophy, whether for materialism or idealism, attention must be paid to the certain continuity of their development (for example, in materialist philosophy, there is an ideological inheritance relationship from Democritus to Feuerbach, and in idealist philosophy, there is also a certain ideological relationship from Plato to Hegel). This is correct and necessary. However, this philosophical inheritance relationship cannot be simply derived from historical conditions and class standpoints. In "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," Lenin exposed the reactionary idealist philosophy of the late 19th century, pointing out that it inherited the ideological line of the 18th-century British subjective idealist Berkeley and agnostic Hume. This is a very good example. This example clearly tells us that the inheritance of philosophical thought can also occur under new historical conditions.

Thirdly, I would like to talk about how to treat the bourgeois history of philosophy. The greatest difficulty in studying the history of philosophy at present is that there is still no history of philosophy written from the Marxist philosophical viewpoint that can be used as a textbook. The "History of Philosophy" edited by the Philosophy Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has not yet been heard of being published. The "Lectures on the History of Foreign Philosophy" planned by the Foreign Philosophy History Teaching and Research Section of Peking University to be published by the People's Publishing House will not be available to readers until next year at the earliest. At present, comrades who study the history of philosophy only rely on classroom lectures and lecture notes as the main materials for study, and even such conditions are not universally available to comrades in every study unit.

Under these study conditions, some comrades apply bourgeois histories of philosophy such as those by Windelband, Weber, Rogers, and Thilly as basic readings. These histories of philosophy, especially Windelband's book, are rich in materials, tightly organized, and concisely narrated. From one aspect, they are indeed rich in content. However, the biggest shortcomings of these histories of philosophy are that they either adopt a subjectivist or objectivist viewpoint to deal with philosophical history issues. The characteristic of the so-called subjectivist history of philosophy lies in using the various materials of philosophical history to match the individual's subjective views on a certain philosophical school or philosopher, thereby fundamentally negating the objective laws of the development of philosophical history. Subjectivist historians of philosophy (such as Windelband) consistently emphasize the importance of idealism in the history of philosophical development, and try their best to distort and reduce the positive role of materialism in the development of philosophical thought in various ways. Although objectivist historians of philosophy (such as Rogers) do not seem to have such blatant one-sidedness in the arrangement of materials, they are not "objective" to the point of treating materialist and idealist philosophers equally. They also attach importance to the development of idealism and still hold a discriminatory attitude towards the historical significance of materialism.

There is also a type of history of philosophy, such as Hegel's "Lectures on the History of Philosophy" and Russell's "History of Western Philosophy," which are not a textbook on the history of philosophy in the general sense, but represent a part of their personal philosophy of history. The characteristic of these histories of philosophy is that they do not deal with philosophical history issues according to the time conditions and objective content of philosophical development, but only according to the individual's view of the historical development of philosophy. For example, Hegel believes that the development of Greek philosophy gets better and better as it goes on, so he puts Anaxagoras, whom he likes and who proposed the absolute concept of "mind," after Democritus in his "Lectures on the History of Philosophy." For example, in his "History of Western Philosophy," Russell devotes almost half as much space to the thought of the great British poet Byron as he does to Hegel; he does not even mention the names of 18th-century French materialists such as La Mettrie or Diderot.

Hegel's "Lectures on the History of Philosophy" does put forward some reasonable ideas, such as the idea of the objective laws of historical development, but the entire narrative is idealistically distorted. And Russell's "History of Western Philosophy" is so subjective that even the bourgeois philosopher Professor A. D. Ritchie could not stand it anymore. Professor Ritchie said in his article "All Thinking Men" (published in "The Observer" 1946·11·24·London edition): "Sir Russell's attitude towards many philosophers is not very good. If he has no good feelings for someone, he only mentions two-thirds of this person's thoughts, and ignores the rest. For example, for the thinkers of the 17th and 18th centuries, Locke is well said, Berkeley is bad, and Hume is roughly not bad. Spinoza is what he likes, so he speaks very well, but Leibniz, who is related to his personal thoughts, is not spoken of very well."

The first type of history of philosophy mentioned above is not suitable as a basic reading for studying the history of philosophy, but it can be considered as a reference for materials when necessary. Even if the second type of history of philosophy is read as a reference book, it still needs someone to guide it. For people with a considerable foundation in the history of philosophy, Hegel's Lectures on the History of Philosophy are worth recommending. However, I think that if it is read in conjunction with the summary of Hegel's "Lectures on the History of Philosophy" in Lenin's "Philosophical Notebooks," the effect of learning will be much better.

Finally, I would like to talk about how to improve the study of the history of philosophy. The study of the history of philosophy, from the perspective of its learning quality, is only a beginning, so we must work hard to create conditions to gradually improve it. How do we improve the study of the history of philosophy?

First, I think we must rapidly develop the research work on the history of Western philosophy. To improve the teaching quality of any discipline, it is impossible without the foundation of scientific research. We encounter many problems in the teaching process, such as whether there is a contradiction between Heraclitus's philosophical viewpoints and political viewpoints? Does Hume's natural theological doctrine contain positive significance? Is "German idealism is a noble reaction to French 18th-century materialism" suitable as a guiding ideology for examining the development process of German idealism? There is no better way to solve these problems than to seek solutions in scientific research.

The philosophical circles of old China did not leave us anything about the research work on the history of Western philosophy. After liberation, not only has the research work in this area not been well developed, but it has not been universally valued. Today, when the Party and the government call on us to march towards science, we can no longer tolerate this state of affairs continuing. We must immediately march towards the science of the history of philosophy. We can conduct research in a planned and step-by-step manner, either with the history of philosophy in a certain period, such as the history of Greek philosophy, the history of modern philosophy, or the history of modern philosophy, or with various philosophical schools, such as Greek atomic materialism, French 18th-century materialism, British empiricism, or continental rationalism, or with individual philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Locke, Descartes, Spinoza, Hume, Diderot, Kant, Hegel, or Feuerbach.

The philosophy departments of all national universities must take responsibility for developing the research work on the history of philosophy, and the Philosophy Institute, which controls the national center for philosophical research, must take more responsibility in this area. In the future, the research work in this area of the philosophy departments of all national universities should establish close contact with the Philosophy Institute, and the comrades of the Philosophy Institute, especially the leading comrades, should also unite the working comrades of the philosophy departments of all national universities in a spirit of cooperation, and work together to promote the development of the research work on the history of philosophy.

Second, I think we must select and translate the famous works of Western classical philosophy in coordination with the needs of learning. Studying the history of philosophy not only requires appropriate textbooks, but also requires the selection of some classical masterpieces as reading materials. Regarding this issue, it is currently very difficult to solve for some comrades who do not master any Western languages. The difficulty lies in the fact that the number of translated Western classical masterpieces into Chinese is not large, and some translations are also of poor quality. Therefore, in order to help these comrades solve the difficulty of reading materials, I think we should conduct a general inspection of the translations of Western classical masterpieces that have been translated in the past, and republish the translations of higher quality, and reprint the translations of poor quality but that can be revised after revision. The translation work of Western classical masterpieces that have not yet been translated into Chinese should be organized with emphasis. This is very necessary to improve the current level of studying the history of philosophy.

Regarding the work of organizing the translation of famous works of Western classical philosophy, the People's Publishing House has formulated a concrete plan, which is very good. However, one point is worth raising to it, that is, when it formulated this plan, it did not seem to consider that the translation of these works must take into account the needs of teaching. Some works are urgently needed in teaching and should be translated earlier, and some that are not urgently needed in teaching can be postponed. Although the translation of this type of work cannot be limited by teaching purposes, there is no harm to the entire plan in determining the translation order of certain works according to the needs of teaching.

Third, I think we must improve the conditions for studying the history of philosophy. Studying the history of philosophy well, like studying other sciences, must have certain conditions. One of the most important conditions for studying the history of Western philosophy is foreign languages. The greatest difficulty in learning that some comrades currently feel is the lack of foreign language reading ability. And this difficulty cannot be completely overcome by more Chinese translations of Western classical masterpieces; because it is unimaginable to study the history of Western philosophy well without contacting some major original works. Graduate students studying the history of philosophy in the Soviet Union must master two foreign languages; people studying the history of philosophy in German universities must have the ability to read Greek and Latin in addition to a modern language.

In addition to having a certain foreign language foundation, comrades studying the history of philosophy must have basic knowledge of the history of science. The struggle between materialism and idealism in the history is also the struggle of materialists to affirm or defend science and idealists to oppose or distort science. Regarding this point, if we analyze what the Democritus line advocates, and what Socrates and Plato oppose? What Berkeley and Hume distort, and what La Mettrie and Diderot represent? What Schelling and Hegel negate, and what Feuerbach struggles against? It is not difficult to understand. Examining the philosophical development of materialism and idealism from the history of scientific development in Western Europe can most deeply understand their historical significance for the development of human thought and culture.

The above are some of my superficial views on the problems that have occurred in the study of the history of philosophy. Finally, I would like to briefly talk about whether it is necessary to study the history of Western philosophy in order to study Chinese philosophy. I think that the current study of Chinese philosophy should be different from the past; because the current Chinese philosophy has established a close connection with Western philosophy through the medium of Marxist philosophy. Chinese philosophy and Western philosophy will become closer day by day, and cannot be as irrelevant as in the past. This is one point. After all, Western philosophy has gone through the development stage of the bourgeoisie, mastered the spirit and methods of natural science, and thus produced Marxist materialist philosophy. Chinese philosophy must be reorganized on the basis of Marxist philosophy, so how is it possible to ignore the ideological source of Marxist philosophical development? This is the second point. Based on these two reasons, I express an affirmative opinion on this issue. Whether it is correct or not, please give me more advice.

    谈谈学习西方哲学史的问题
    洪谦
    新中国成立这些年来，对于学习哲学的要求是一天天地增加了，但是对于学习哲学史的要求则远远地落在后面。学习辩证唯物主义哲学不与西方哲学史结合起来，这种学习方法是不是与马克思主义的历史观点有些抵触呢？
    最近二、三年来，这种学习哲学的方法已经有了转变。现在不仅综合性大学里普遍地开设了哲学史这门课程（例如北京大学哲学系外国哲学史教研室这一学年就开了三班不同年级的哲学史），就以我们所知道的来说，干部学校如中央团校和文化机关如中国青年社都在进行哲学史的学习。这是一种很好的转变。不过随着这个转变产生了一些关于学习哲学史的问题。我且就这些问题提供一点意见，聊供学习哲学史的同志们的参考。
    首先，我想谈谈如何有重点地学习哲学史这个问题。在党和政府提出百家争鸣的学术政策的前后，对于这个问题的看法却存在着不正确的一面。在百家争鸣以前，学习哲学史的重点放在唯物主义派别或唯物主义哲学家，对于唯物主义以外的哲学派别或哲学家只是极其简单地提到。如果教师们对于这一类哲学家的思想体系比较客观而系统地讲授，就会被目为“替资产阶级反动思想作义务宣传”。在百家争鸣以后，学习哲学史的重点在有些人看来似乎转向唯心主义派别和唯心主义哲学家，有些同志们竟认为只有唯心主义那样“细致的”理论才能使人感到“满足”，觉得“过瘾”；唯物主义的哲学家在毕业论文选题中不是受人欢迎的对象；甚至于在哲学系一年级个别的同学中，柏拉图的对话集是他们最喜爱的读物。
    这样有重点地学习哲学史会得到怎样的效果呢？或者如过去几年的教学经验告诉我们那样：对于唯心主义派别和唯心主义哲学家只学到一点关于它们的基本观点、主要结论以及从某种观点到达某种结论的极其简单的过程的知识，只知道某个哲学家是客观唯心主义者或主观唯心主义者、或不可知论者，对于这些哲学家的思想内容有一个比较系统的了解则是根本谈不到的。或者如在解放以前普遍地对于唯物主义和唯心主义的历史意义的看法，唯心主义的哲学传统简直是人类思想文化的最高表现，而唯物主义在哲学和科学的发展过程中只发生了消极的作用；唯物主义哲学无论在世界观或认识论方面都是没有值得学习的。这样学习哲学史的效果我敢肯定地说，不仅不是我们今天所希望，而且必须设法加以避免的。
    在我看来，要想避免在哲学史学习中再产生这样不良的效果，最好我们不要简单地按照唯物主义或唯心主义的差别，而要按照哲学史中影响不同和大小不同的各种哲学派别和哲学家的标准，来制定学习哲学史的重点。实际上要想达到学习哲学史的基本要求，也应该如此的。我们总不能认为一位只知道德谟克利特而不知道柏拉图，只知道柏克莱或休谟而不知道倍根或霍布士，只知道十八世纪法国唯物主义而不知道十九世纪德国唯心主义的人是很好地掌握了哲学史的知识吧？
    这样有重点地进行哲学史的学习不仅没有客观主义的毛病，而且是合乎马克思主义的实事求是的学习方法的。因为唯物主义哲学是从与唯心主义的斗争中发展起来的；这两种不同世界观的斗争在哲学史中虽然旗帜鲜明，但是从作为它们的斗争问题的对象来说，则只有一个。唯物主义与唯心主义的斗争是针对着同一的对象而有不同的看法才发生的（例如如果德谟克利特所肯定的存在客观性与柏拉图所否定的存在物质性不是针对着同一的对象，那末还有什么德谟克利特路线与柏拉图路线的斗争呢？）。因此我们对于这个斗争过程了解愈全面，愈细致，则对于唯物主义的发展历史愈感到内容丰富和意义伟大。
    其次，我想谈谈如何结合社会历史背景学习哲学史这个问题。哲学史是研究各种哲学观点发展的历史，而各种哲学观点是在意识形态上反映了某个时期的社会物质生活条件和阶级斗争的具体情况的。因此我们要想客观地、科学地了解某个时期的哲学历史发展的过程，则必须采取马克思主义的历史观点。唯心主义的哲学家为了抹煞哲学发展的客观规律性，总是提倡所谓思想的绝对独立性，思想产生思想的说法。的确，如果我们不按照历史主义观点而专从思想的绝对独立性来考察唯心主义哲学的发展，是会容易地走到唯心主义的圈子里去的。唯心主义的哲学家最能动人之点，唯一地就在于他们“细致的”思想体系；在这个体系之内所谓理念、感觉意识、“绝对精神”，似乎毫无疑问地支配着整个物质世界和社会存在。但是，如果我们追问一下，何以具体事物是模写了理念？何以客观存在必须依存于主体？何以历史的发展是“绝对精神”的体现？关于这一些问题，我想无论柏拉图、柏克莱或黑格尔如果抛开了他们那一套“细致的”理论，就无法答复的。关于这些问题，我们只能回到他们的哲学所反映的历史条件和阶级关系，并加以具体分析之后，才能得到科学的答复和正确的了解。
    学习哲学更当然要结合当时的社会历史背景，但同时也不能忽视了哲学思想的相对独立性以及它的发展的一定继承性。所谓哲学思想的相对独立性就是说：哲学虽然在思想上反映了各种阶级社会的观点，但是这种反映由于以前流传下来的思维材料和思想方法的影响，已经形成了一种独特的形态，因此我们无论对唯物主义或唯心主义哲学家进行学习，必须紧紧地抓住这种思想形态的形成过程和具体内容，才能达到对于他们正确的认识，如果我们忽视这一点而企图单纯地从社会历史背景或阶级关系中引伸出各种不同的论证或结论，那末对于学习哲学史不仅没有帮助，而且还重复了列宁尖锐地批判过的将历史唯物主义庸俗化的思想方法。但是今天还是有同志这样地进行哲学史的学习。他学习到亚里斯多德的四因说时候，曾在“古代希腊”史这本书中力图发现物质因和作用因是代表那种阶级利益的，形式因和目的因是反映那种阶级关系的，这位同志虽然在这上面费了很大力气，但是结果对于亚里斯多德的了解并不见明确一些，相反地亚里斯多德一天天地更使他感到“十分的头痛”了。
    亚里斯多德使这位同志感到“十分的头痛”，亚里斯多德绝对不能负什么责任，因为他没有请这位同志直接地从他的老祖宗那里，他是要人从他的“形而上学”，“物理学”等著作里面去了解哲学思想。亚里斯多德的哲学并不是从他的妈妈的肚子里就形成了的，而是他继承柏拉图的思想并加以批判地吸收才产生出来的。学习哲学史无论对于唯物主义或唯心主义都必须要注意它们发展一定的继承性（例如在唯物主义哲学中从德谟克利特到费尔巴哈有着思想的继承关系，在唯心主义哲学中从柏拉图到黑格尔也有着一定的思想关系），这是正确而必要的。但是这种哲学的继承关系也不是简单地从历史条件和阶级立场中可以引伸出来的。列宁在“唯物主义与经验批判主义”中揭露了十九世纪末叶的唯心主义反动哲学时，指出了它继承了十八世纪英国主观唯心主义者柏克莱和不可知论者休谟的思想路线，这就是一个很好的例子。这个例子显明地告诉我们：哲学思想的继承性在新的历史条件之下也会产生的。
    再次，我想谈谈如何对待资产阶级的哲学史这个问题。在目前学习哲学史最感到困难的，就是还没有一本从马克思主义哲学观点上写成的哲学史可以作为教本来使用。苏联科学院哲学研究所主编的“哲学史”，还没有听到出版的消息。北京大学外国哲学史教研室拟交人民出版社出版的“外国哲学史讲义”，最早也须明年才能与读者见面。现在学习哲学史的同志们只靠课堂讲授和讲稿作为学习的主要材料，而且连这样的条件也并不是每个学习单位的同志们普遍能够得到的。
    在这种学习条件之下，于是有些同志们就应用资产阶级的哲学史如温德尔班、韦伯、洛洁斯、梯利等的作为基本读物。这些哲学史，其中特别是温德尔班的一本，都是材料繁多，组织严密，叙述扼要，单从一方面来说，的确是内容丰富的。不过这些哲学史的最大缺点不是采取了主观主义，就是采取了客观主义观点来处理哲学史问题的。所谓主观主义的哲学史的特征，是在于拿哲学史的各种材料来配合个人对于某种哲学学派或哲学家主观的看法，从而根本否定哲学史发展的客观规律性。主观主义的哲学史家（例如温德尔班）一致地强调唯心主义在哲学发展史中的重要性，尽量地用种种方式来歪曲和降低唯物主义在哲学思想发展上的积极作用。客观主义的哲学史家（如洛洁斯）虽然在材料安排上似乎没有那样露骨的片面性，但是并不是“客观”到那样地步，对于唯物主义和唯心主义的哲学家一视同仁，他们同样是重视唯心主义的发展，对于唯物主义的历史意义仍然抱歧视态度的。
    还有一类的哲学史，如黑格尔的“哲学史讲演录”和罗素的“西方哲学史”，根本就不是一种在一般意义下的哲学史教本，而是代表他们个人的历史哲学的一部分。这些哲学史的特点就是不按照哲学发展的时间条件和客观内容，只是按照个人对于哲学历史发展的看法来处理哲学史问题的。例如黑格尔认为希腊哲学的发展愈到后来愈好，所以将他所喜爱的，提出“心灵”的绝对观念的阿那克萨戈拉在他的“哲学史讲演录”中放在德谟克利特之后。例如罗素在他的“西方哲学史”中叙述英国大诗人拜伦的思想所占的篇幅几乎占了黑格尔篇幅的一半；对于法国十八世纪唯物主义如拉梅特里或狄德罗等则连名字都没有提到。
    黑格尔的“哲学史讲演录”中诚然提出一些合理观念，如历史发展的客观规律性等思想，但是整个叙述是唯心的歪曲的。而罗素的“西方哲学史”竟主观到这种地步，连资产阶级的哲学家里杰（A．D．Ritchie）教授都实在看不下去了。里杰教授在他的“所有思想着的人们”一文中（载“观察家”1946·11·24．伦敦版）说：“罗素爵士对于许多哲学家的态度是不大好的。如果他对某一个人无有好感，则他只略举此人思想三分之二，其他就不管了。例如对于十七、八世纪的思想家，洛克说得还好，柏克莱就坏了，休谟还大致不差。斯宾诺莎是他所喜欢的，所以说得非常好，可是对于与他个人思想有关系的来布尼兹说得并不怎样好。”
    以上所举的两类哲学史的第一类作为学习哲学史的基本读物并不适宜，但作为必要时的在材料上的参考还是可以考虑的。属于第二类的哲学史就是作为参考书来阅读，也还需要有人从旁指导。对于哲学史具有相当基础的人来说，黑格尔的哲学史讲演录是值得推荐的。不过我认为如果与列宁的“哲学笔记”中的“黑格尔‘哲学史讲演录’”一书摘要对照阅读则学习的效果行将要好得多。
    最后我想谈谈如何提高哲学史的学习这个问题。哲学史的学习一直到现在从其学习质量来说，还仅仅是一个开始，所以我们必须努力创造条件逐步地将它提高起来。我们怎样提高哲学史的学习呢？
    第一我认为必须迅速开展西方哲学史的研究工作。要提高任何一门学科的教学质量，没有科学研究的基础都是不可能的。我们在教学过程中遇到许多的问题，例如赫拉克利特的哲学观点与政治观点之间是否有矛盾？休谟的自然宗教学说是否包含着积极的意义？“德国唯心主义是对于法国十八世纪唯物主义的贵族反动”作为考察德国唯心主义发展过程的指导思想是不是适宜？这些问题除了向科学研究中寻求解决的途径之外，是无其他更好的办法的。
    关于西方哲学史方面的研究工作，旧中国的哲学界没有给我们留下什么东西。解放以后对于这方面的研究工作不但没有很好地开展，而且也没有被人普遍的重视。当今天党和政府号召我们向科学进军的时候，我们再不能容忍这种状态继续下去，我们必须立刻向哲学史这门科学进军。我们或者以某个时期的哲学史如希腊哲学史、近代哲学史或现代哲学史，或者以各种哲学派别如希腊原子唯物主义、十八世纪法国唯物主义、英国经验主义或大陆理性主义，或以个别哲学家如柏拉图、亚里斯多德、洛克、笛卡尔、斯宾诺莎、休谟、狄德罗、康德、黑格尔或费尔巴哈作为对象，有计划地、有步骤地进行研究。
    全国高等学校的哲学系对于开展哲学史的研究工作都必须负起责任，而掌握全国哲学研究中心的哲学研究所在这一方面必须负起更多的责任。今后全国高等学校的哲学系在这方面的研究工作应该与哲学研究所取得亲密的联系，而哲学研究所的同志，特别是领导同志也应该以合作的精神来团结全国高等学校的哲学系的工作同志，共同地为推进哲学史研究工作的开展而努力。
    第二我认为必须配合学习上的需要选译西方古典哲学的名著。学习哲学史不仅需要适当的教本，同时也还需要选出一些古典名著作为阅读的资料。关于这个问题，目前对于有些不掌握任何一种西方语言的同志们来说，是非常难解决的。这个困难点就在于关于西方古典名著译成中文的在数量上并不多，其中有些译本在质量上也还低劣。因此我认为为了帮助这些同志们解决阅读资料的困难，应该将过去所翻译的关于西方古典名著的译本作一次总检查，并将质量较高的译本重新出版，质量不高而能修改的即加以修改后重新付印。以前还没有中文译本的西方古典名著应该有重点地组织翻译工作。这一点对于提高当前哲学史的学习水平来说，是非常必要的。
    关于组织翻译西方古典哲学名著工作，人民出版社已经拟定了具体的计划，这是很好的。不过有一点意见值得向它提出的，就是它拟定这个计划的时候，似乎没有考虑到翻译这些著作须顾到教学方面的需要。有些著作是教学上迫切需要的，应该早点翻译出来，有些不是教学上迫切需要的，就可以暂缓一步。虽然翻译这一类的著作不能为教学目的所限制，但是按照教学的需要来拟定某些著作的翻译前后，对于整个计划来说，并没有妨害的。
    第三我认为必须改善学习哲学史的条件。学好哲学史和学好其他一门科学一样，必须具有一定的条件。学习西方哲学史最主要条件之一就是外国语。当前对于有些同志感到的学习上的最大困难，就是缺乏外国语的阅读能力。而且这种困难并不是通过更多的关于西方古典名著的中文译本可以彻底克服；因为要想学好西方哲学史而不与某些主要的原文著作接触，这是不可想像的。在苏联研究哲学史的研究生必须掌握两种外国语；在德国大学研究哲学史的人，除了一种现代语言之外，还必须具有阅读希腊拉丁文的能力。
    学习哲学史的同志除了有一定的外国语基础以外，对于科学史应有基本的知识。哲学史中唯物主义与唯心主义的斗争也可以说是唯物主义者肯定或保卫科学而唯心主义者反对或歪曲科学的斗争。关于这一点，如果我们分析一下德谟克利特路线所主张的是什么，而苏格拉底与柏拉图所反对的是什么？柏克莱与休谟所歪曲的是什么，而拉梅特里与狄德罗所代表的是什么？谢林与黑格尔所否定的是什么，而费尔巴哈所斗争的是什么？就不难明白了。从西欧科学发展史上考察唯物主义与唯心主义的哲学发展，最能深入地了解它们对于人类思想文化发展的历史意义。
    以上是我对学习哲学史中所发生的问题的一些粗浅的看法。最后我想简单地谈谈研究中国哲学是否需要学习西方哲学史这个问题。我认为现在研究中国哲学与过去应有所不同；因为现在的中国哲学通过马克思主义哲学的媒介，已经与西方哲学建立了亲密的联系，中国哲学与西方哲学将一天天地接近，不能像过去那样毫不相干。此其一点。西方哲学毕竟经过了资产阶级的发展阶段，掌握了自然科学精神和思想方法，因而才产生了马克思主义的唯物主义哲学。中国哲学是必须在马克思主义哲学基础上加以整理的，那么如何可能将马克思主义哲学发展的思想根源置之不理呢？此其二点。根据这两点理由，我对于这个问题是表示肯定的意见的。正确与否，还请同志们多多指教。
