    One Jackfruit Tree Can Produce Over 1,400 Jin
    In Hengkeng Township, Nanjing County, Fujian Province, there is a jackfruit tree that has grown over a hundred jackfruits. Each jackfruit generally weighs fourteen or fifteen jin, with the larger ones reaching thirty jin each. According to local farmers' estimates, this tree can produce at least 1,400 jin of jackfruit.
    It is said that this jackfruit tree was brought back from Southeast Asia by overseas Chinese more than a hundred years ago. Now, the tree is over two zhang tall, and its trunk is so large that it takes three people to encircle it. The leaves are green year-round. It flowers in March and April every year, and the jackfruit begins to ripen in September. It tastes sweet and delicious, with flavors of lychee and banana.

    一株波萝蜜树可产一千四百多斤
    福建省南靖县珩坑乡有一株波萝蜜树，结了一百多只波萝蜜，每只一般重十四、五斤，大的一个达三十斤。根据当地农民估计，这株树最少能产波萝蜜一千四百多斤。
    这株波萝蜜树据说是在一百多年前由华侨从南洋带回来的。现在树高二丈多，它的主干三个人还围抱不拢。树叶常年绿色。每年3、4月间开花，到9月间波萝蜜开始成熟。味甘美，含有荔枝和香蕉的味道。
