    Night Measurement of Polaris
    Liu Yang
    After two days of heavy snow, the perpetually snow-capped peaks and freshly snow-covered fields of the Qilian Mountains' Gobi desert shimmered in a vast expanse of white.
    In the villages along the Gansu-Xinjiang Highway, the villagers had long since gone to sleep, but in the dilapidated temple at the entrance to the village, the sound of voices remained so boisterous.
    Our surveying team has been "settled" in this dilapidated temple on the edge of the Gobi desert for over a month. The triangulation control survey work has been basically completed, but due to the inclement weather, the "Polaris observation" has been hampered, causing the interior adjustment work to be stalled for a time, affecting the normal progress of the next process. The task requirements were very tight, and every member of the surveying team longed for good weather!
    The sky finally cleared. The moon emerged from the jade-like snow, its clear light pouring into the ancient temple and illuminating the Gobi desert. The young men jumped up, happier than if they had eaten a hundred Hami melons. The comrades of the astronomical observation group immediately took action, preparing the instruments and tools. Little Zhang, who came from the local agricultural cooperative to help, boiled a large pot of hot noodles to give the comrades some "firepower". Fearing encountering wolves in the Gobi desert, Old Chen borrowed a red-tasseled spear from the cooperative. The horse the cooperative lent us also arrived. Ha! And a donkey!
    The captain and Old Wang left first. The theodolite is a precision instrument and cannot be transported by horse, so it had to be carried on someone's back. Many people competed to do this hard work of carrying a twenty-odd kilogram instrument for several kilometers, but when they went to look for it, the instrument was gone. The captain had left a note where the instrument had been placed, having quickly taken the lead. The captain is a veteran, and his temperament is always like this.
    Having packed all the necessary items, the observation group was ready to depart. Ha! Look! Each one looked like a warrior god from the temple. Little Mei, who had only recently graduated from school, had only ridden a horse once before, when surveying in Inner Mongolia, but that was during the day. This was her first time riding such a large horse and traveling through the Gobi desert at night. She tucked her braids into her large fur hat, first straddled a tall, dark-red horse, and shook the reins at Comrade Yuan Qing, who had just stepped out of the temple gate, saying, "Let's race!" At this moment, the deputy captain, who was the last to come out after checking the preparations, waved his hand at her: "Get down, girl! This is the same horse we used when selecting the observation point, and it threw me off. It's not well-behaved. The snow is thick on the Gobi desert, and there are also pebbles. Falling is no joke. You should ride this donkey instead." It seemed that Little Mei wanted to argue, but seeing everyone waiting for her, she quickly dismounted the horse and mounted the donkey. Yuan Qing mounted the horse Little Mei had been riding and said to Little Mei, "We won't race donkeys with you. Let's go!" He casually shook the red-tasseled spear in his hand, "I'll guard the rear!" He really had the air of "Changban Slope."
    "Dai!" (Northwestern local sound for urging a horse) The group of people and horses set off.
    The semi-circular moon shone on the boundless wilderness, blindingly silver-white. Although the cold air was biting, riding a horse at night on this snow-covered Gobi desert under the moonlight was uniquely interesting, giving a refreshing and pleasant feeling. After walking for a while, the deputy captain looked back at the positions of several constellations, distinguished the direction, and said to the other comrades, "I have to go first! Dai!" He shook the reins in his hand and galloped toward the base point like the wind. There are no roads in the Gobi desert, but everywhere can be a road, as long as you avoid the dunes and piles of rocks, you can proceed at will. The important thing is to accurately grasp the direction, otherwise, you may completely mistake south for north. For the surveying team, there is no need to worry about them, because they are experts in grasping direction.
    When everyone arrived at the observation station along with the slow-moving donkey, the deputy captain had already set up the theodolite, and the captain had also connected the battery box cable to the instrument. Looking south, the No. 3 light beacon at the foot of the Qilian Mountains was already lit. This was the achievement of Old Wang, who had arrived earlier with the captain. After dismounting, Little Xu immediately checked his watch against the captain's. His watch and the captain's watch had been synchronized with the time signal station several times. To ensure the accuracy of the surveying work, this kind of time synchronization was very important. Little Mei, panting, took out the recording book from her satchel and huddled in front of the small light bulb that was being used for illumination. Everything was ready. "Can we start?" Little Mei said to the deputy captain. "No! Rest for a few minutes!" Little Mei was surprised, but immediately understood the deputy captain's meaning—these warriors who had ridden here at full speed, with their breathing still unsteady, were not suitable for immediately starting precise observations that required simultaneous work of hands, eyes, and brain. Today, the deputy captain was personally performing the observations, because the accuracy requirements for this astronomical observation were very high, and rework was absolutely not allowed.
    After the snow, although there was no wind, the dry cold was still terrible. Little Xu, who was from Shanghai and had not been working in the north for long, couldn't help but shiver, his teeth chattering. The observer re-adjusted the instrument's alignment and leveling, and tested the light intensity of the two dials.
    "Start!" the deputy captain announced. The timekeeper and recorder listened attentively, not a single person speaking. The silence was like the silence before a battle. "Target No. 3! Zero degrees, zero minutes, six and twelve hundredths of a second!" "Ready! Okay! Polaris! Horizontal plate! One hundred seventy-nine degrees, thirty-six minutes, twenty-five and forty-seven hundredths of a second!" "Zenith distance!..." Little Mei recorded quickly and accurately, while Little Xu watched the second hand of the watch with all his attention. They both reported the data in high-pitched voices, one after the other. The work was proceeding smoothly... The tense atmosphere of labor made the Qilian Mountains in the moonlight even more solemn, and the entire Gobi desert embraced these fearless young people with snow and moonlight.
    When the observation reached the fourth repetition, the deputy captain suddenly said in an urgent tone, "Quick! Quick, change the new battery box! The dial is not clear!" The captain's heart skipped a beat, and he quickly replaced the wire connectors with his numb fingers. Everyone was stunned. "Captain, it may be that the battery is bad. The cooperative in the county only has this kind of battery, and it has been stored for too long." As soon as Little Xu's words fell, the deputy captain shouted in a voice he had never used before: "Bad! The No. 3 beacon is out!" This was simply a bolt from the blue. Everyone understood that the power shortage was also occurring at the beacon.
    The comrades' moods became heavy and tense. They had finally waited for a good "starry sky" with great difficulty, and it would be terrible if the work was interrupted because of this! Even if they could continue the observations, they would have to wait for Old Wang, who was guarding the beacon, to replace the battery. However, replacing the battery on the beacon was not an easy task. The battery box was mounted on a tripod, and moving the battery box would require re-erecting the tripod, which would take time and greatly affect the accuracy of the observations. "What to do!..." Everyone was worried. Old Yuan took a few dry batteries, jumped on his horse, and was about to gallop toward the beacon. "Old Yuan, wait a minute, look at that! Is it a star, or is the beacon lit again?" The observer immediately bent over and looked into the lens. "The beacon is lit again! How could it be lit again..." Never mind! Start the observation! ...One hundred and eighty degrees..." No one understood the reason why the beacon had immediately reignited, but Polaris did not allow people time to study the situation, so we threw ourselves back into the intense work. Old Yuan was stunned on his horse. To find out what was going on and prevent the same situation from happening again, he still spurred his horse towards point No. 3.
    When Old Yuan arrived at point No. 3, the truth was revealed—Old Wang was holding a long flashlight in both hands, illuminating the crosshairs on the beacon. "You're something! Really good! How did you come up with this trick?" Old Yuan said admiringly, "I'll take over for you. You rest for a while." Old Wang said nothing. After carefully waiting for Yuan Qing to get a firm grip on the flashlight, he quickly waved his arms. In this way, creative labor ensured the smooth progress of the entire operation.
    After the observation was completed, everyone breathed a sigh of relief. It was then that they realized how piercingly cold the Gobi desert was in the middle of the night. The deputy captain kept breathing on his hands. Little Mei glanced at him and said to Little Xu, "Look at this white-browed old man!" It turned out that he had been wearing a mask to avoid the breath he exhaled from freezing on the eyepiece of the instrument. The breath that escaped from the edge of the mask had gathered on his eyebrows, turning into frost, truly resembling the white-haired old man from New Year's Eve.
    On the way back, the cold moon was setting in the west, and accompanied by the rhythm of the horses' hooves, the song of the surveying team members was sung:
    "It is the wind of the valley that blows our red flag; it is the violent rain that washes our tents. We have fire-like enthusiasm, overcoming all fatigue and cold..."

    夜测北极星
    刘阳
    飘了两天大雪，祁连山的戈壁滩上，常年积雪的峰峦和初雪的原野辉映成皑皑一片。
    在甘新公路两侧的村子里，老乡们早已入睡了，只有村头这座破庙内人声还是这么喧闹。
    我们这支测量队，“落户”在戈壁滩边上的这座破庙内已经一个多月了，三角网控制测量工作已经基本结束；但由于天不作美，风雪阻挠了“北极星观测”的进行，致使内业平差工作一度停顿，影响了下一个工序的正常进行。任务要求非常紧，测量队的每个成员是如何地渴望着好天气啊！
    天真的晴了。月亮从白玉般的雪地上涌了出来，清光泻进古庙，照亮了戈壁滩。小伙子们跳起来了，真比吃一百个哈密瓜还高兴。天文观测组的同志马上行动起来，准备好了仪器、工具，当地农业社来帮忙的小张烧了一大锅热面汤，给同志们加些“火力”。怕在戈壁滩上碰到狼，老陈到社里借来了红缨枪。合作社借给我们的马也来了。哈！还有一头驴！
    队长和老王先走了。经纬仪是精密的仪器，不能用马运，只好人背上，好多人争着干这个背上二十几公斤仪器走几公里路的辛苦活儿，但去找时仪器已经不见了，队长在放仪器的地方留了一个条子便捷足先登了。队长是个转业军人，他的脾气总是这样的。
    背好了一切必要携带的东西，观测组要出发了。哈！看吧！一个个好像庙里的神将一样。刚离开学校不久的小梅还只是第二次骑马；头一回是在内蒙古测量的时候，但那是白天；骑上这样大的马夜走戈壁滩她还是头一遭。她把发辫装进了大皮帽子，第一个跨上了一个高大的枣红马，向刚走出庙门的袁庆同志抖了抖缰绳说：“咱们蹓蹓（比赛）！”这时检查了准备工作最后走出来的副队长向她摆了摆手：“下来吧姑娘！选点的时候就是这匹马，把我摔了下来，它不老实，滩上雪厚，又有卵石，摔一家伙可不是玩的，你还是骑这头毛驴吧。”看样子，小梅还想争辩，但见大家都在等自己，就迅速下马上驴。袁庆跨上了小梅原来骑的那匹马，向小梅说：“咱不和你赛驴，走吧！”他把红缨枪顺手一抖，“本帅断后！”真有点“长坂坡”的味儿。
    “呆?”！（西北当地人?喝马的声音）一行人马出动了。
    半圆的月亮照射在无垠的原野上，银白刺眼。虽然冷气袭人，但在这铺满月光的雪戈壁上骑马夜行却别具风趣，给人一种清凉快慰的感觉。走了一段路，副队长回头看了看几个星座的位置，辨别了一下方向，向其他同志说：“我得先走了！呆?！”他抖了抖手中的缰绳，飞也似的向基点驰骋而去。戈壁滩上没有路，但处处都可以是路，只要避开堆砂堆石，便可以任意前进。重要的是，必须准确地掌握方向，否则，你完全可能以南作北。这对测量队来讲，无须为他们担心，因为他们是掌握方向的专家。
    当大家同跑不快的毛驴赶到观测站时，副队长已经架好了经纬仪，队长把电池盒的线也接到仪器上了。向南望去，祁连山山脚下的三号灯标已经亮了，这是和队长一起提前赶到的老王的成绩。小徐下马后立刻和队长对了一下表，他今天担任记时的任务，他的表和队长的表是一起经过几次与报时台对准过的，为了保证测量工作的精确度，这种对时工作十分重要。小梅喘息着由背囊内拿出记录簿，凑在唯一做照明用的小灯泡前面。一切都准备就绪了。“可以开始了吧？”小梅对副队长说。“不！休息几分钟！”小梅诧异了一下，立刻就领会到副队长的意思。——这些飞马赶来的勇士，气喘未定，是不适宜立刻开始手、眼、脑子同时工作的精密观测的。今天副队长亲自做观测者，因为这次天文观测精度要求非常高，同时又绝对不允许返工。
    雪后，虽然没有风，但干冷也够呛。小徐是上海人，在北方工作还不久，身子禁不住地发抖，牙齿在“咯咯”地打着颤。观测者再一次校正了仪器的对点和水平，试了一下两个度盘的灯光强度。
    “开始吧！”副队长宣布说。记时和记录的人凝神倾听着，没有一个人说话。沉寂，就像战斗打响以前的沉寂。“三号目标！零度零零分零六点十二秒！”“准备！好！北极星！水平盘！一百七十九度三十六分二十五点四十七秒！”“天顶距！……”小梅迅速准确地记录着，小徐全神贯注地看着手表的秒针，他俩先后用尖嗓子回报着数据。工作顺利地进行着……紧张的劳动气氛使月光中的祁连山愈发严肃了，整个戈壁滩用雪色和月光拥抱了这些无畏的青年。
    观测进行到第四测回，突然副队长用紧急的口吻说：“快！快换新电池盒！度盘不清楚！”队长心里捏了一把汗，立刻用冻得不大灵活的手赶快换接线头。大家都怔住了。“队长，这可能是电池不好，县城里的合作社就只有这种电池，并且放的时间太久了。”小徐的话刚落音，副队长用从来没有过的声音呼喊起来：“坏了！三号点灯标灭了！”这简直是晴天霹雳。大家懂得，电力不足的情况同样在灯标处也发生了。
    同志们的心情沉重紧张了起来，好容易盼星星盼月亮地等来了个好“星空”，要是因此中断工作是多么糟糕呵！就是能够继续观测，也要等守着灯标的老王把电池换上才行。但是，灯标换电池可不是一件容易的事，电池盒安在三脚架上，要动电池盒就必须重新架立三脚架，这需要时间，也会使观测精度大受影响。“怎么办呢！……”大家在忧虑着。老袁拿了几筒干电池翻身上马，要向灯标驰去。“老袁等一等，你们看那是什么？是星星呢还是灯标又亮了呢？”观测者马上俯身朝镜筒看去，”灯标又着了！怎么会又着了呢……”不管它！开始观测！……一百八十度……。”谁也没弄懂灯标会立刻复燃的道理，但是北极星不容许给人研究情况的时间，我们又投入紧张的工作。老袁在马上看呆了，为了弄清是怎么回事，不让同样情况再发生，他还是打马向三号点奔去。
    老袁赶到了三号点一看，真相大白了——老王双手举着长筒手电，给灯标上的十字盘照明。“有你的！真行！亏你想得出这个招儿”，老袁敬佩地说：“我替你，你休息一下吧。”老王没说什么，小心地等袁庆抓稳手电后，连忙摆动着手臂。就这样，创造性的劳动保证了整个操作过程的顺利进行。
    观测完了，大家松了一口气。这时候才意识到深夜的戈壁滩是这么透骨的冷。副队长直向手哈气。小梅看了他一眼，向小徐说：“你看这白眉毛老头儿！”原来他为了避免呼出的气冻结在仪器的目镜上，是带了口罩操作的，从口罩边透出的气集结在眉毛上，变成了霜，真有点像大年夜的白雪老人。
    归途，冷月西斜，伴着马蹄的节奏，勘测队员之歌唱起来了：
    “是那山谷的风，吹动了我们的红旗；是那狂暴的雨，洗刷了我们的帐篷。我们有火一般的热情，战胜了一切疲劳和寒冷，……”
