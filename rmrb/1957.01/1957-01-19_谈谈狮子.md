Talking About Lions
    庄学本

    After reading Mr. Zhou Jianren's "Speaking of Tigers," I also want to talk about lions.

    In ancient China, lions were called "Suanni," and they were found in Africa and western Asia. Wild lions in Asia are now extinct, and only a hundred or two are said to remain in the Gir Forest area on the west coast of India, where they are under artificial protection. The two nearby native states used to fight and shed blood to compete for them, but now they are jointly managed and exports are prohibited. In Africa, hunting is also prohibited because the number of lions is already small.

    The lions we commonly see in zoos and circuses are African lions. A large male lion can weigh up to 500 jin (250 kg) and be 3 meters long. The characteristics of lions are that male lions have many long manes around their necks, like wearing a long fur collar, which makes them look particularly majestic; the end of the long tail has a black tuft of hair, inside which is a thicker section of hard bone.

    Lions belong to the cat family and are nocturnal carnivores. They sleep during the day and forage at night. In Africa, they feed on giraffes, zebras, antelopes, etc. It is said that their favorite food is zebra meat. Lions are gregarious animals and live together in families, so they often use encirclement tactics when hunting, making it difficult for the beasts targeted to escape their grasp.

    Lions are relatively easy animals to raise and can also breed in zoos. After three or four years of age, female lions become pregnant and can give birth to two to four cubs per litter, with a lifespan of over twenty years. Lions are also relatively easy to tame among wild beasts. They are often taught to perform in large circuses, and when a lion opens its mouth wide, the performer can put their head inside without getting hurt.

    The roar of a lion is astonishing. They often get up and roar every evening. If you have never heard a lion's roar, you might think it is an earthquake when you suddenly hear a male lion's roar. The sound is indeed extremely majestic. Therefore, in Buddhist scriptures, "lion's roar" is used to describe Shakyamuni - the first cry of the Buddha at birth. The roar of a lion is also generally a hunting tactic. It is said that before ambushing other animals in the grass, they often jump out unexpectedly and let out a loud roar to startle the animals, and then pounce on them, thus securing their prey.

    Lions and tigers are both called "kings of beasts," but who is the strongest? Comparing their weight, length, etc., they seem to be about the same. So far, no one has been so keen to let them have a match to see who this throne should belong to. However, in foreign countries, some people have already paired male lions and female tigers as couples. The "Erya" says: "Suanni" resembles a "leopard cat and eats tigers and leopards," so in our folklore, lions are generally more valued. In fact, wild elephants and rhinoceros are much stronger than lions and tigers. It is said that an African rhinoceros can defeat three or four lions, but wild elephants and rhinoceros are not carnivores, so they do not harm other animals (unless other wild animals attack them first), nor do they compete for supremacy in the animal kingdom.

    China does not produce lions, and very few lions have come to China. According to historical records, the earliest lion to come to the mainland was probably one offered as tribute by Shule in the Western Regions during the reign of Emperor Shun of the Han Dynasty more than 1,800 years ago. However, people have long been familiar with and interested in the image of the lion. In front of palaces, temples, memorial archways, large residences, and old shops, there are pairs of large bronze or stone lions. Some houses also have small lions placed on the roof ridge. There are also lions on incense burners. There are also lions on ceramics, lions on the knobs of seals, lions in folk embroidery and paper cuttings, many goods use lions on their trademarks, and children play with lion lanterns during the New Year. There is lion dancing (or lion jumping) in folk cultural activities. In ethnic minority areas, there are lions on the god seats, murals, and shamanic dances in lama temples in Inner Mongolia and Tibet. There are also lions in the chess pieces of Inner Mongolian herders, and lions on women's headdresses and embroidered tobacco pouches.

    However, after all, we are not a country that produces lions, and in the past, artists rarely saw real lions, so in terms of modeling, there are quite a few that are depicted as majestic and detailed, but in fact, there is still a certain distance from the image of real lions. However, this kind of modeling has long become our traditional artistic style. In addition, another feature of its modeling is that it is often paired with an embroidered ball under its front feet, which adds a lot of fun to it. (Attached picture)

    谈谈狮子
    庄学本
    读了周建人先生的“说虎”，也想来谈谈狮子。
    狮子，我国古时叫做“狻麑”，产地在非洲和亚洲西部。亚洲的野生狮子现在已经绝迹，仅在印度西海岸的吉尔森林区听说还剩有一二百头，已经受人工保护。附近的两个土邦以前为了争夺它们，曾打过仗、流过血，现在由双方共管，禁止输出。非洲的狮子也因为数已经不多，实行了禁猎。
    我们在动物园和马戏团里常见到的都是非洲狮子，大的一头雄狮可以重达五百斤，长达三公尺。狮子的特点是雄狮颈项里环生许多长鬣，像围着一条长毛皮领，格外显得仪表雄伟；长尾的末梢长有一个黑毛球，里面是一节较粗的硬骨。
    狮子属猫科动物，是夜行性的食肉兽，白天沉睡，夜间觅食，在非洲以捕捉长颈鹿、斑马、羚羊等为食物，据说它们最爱吃的是斑马肉。狮子是合群性的动物，一个家族聚居在一起，因此它们猎食时常用围攻的阵式，那些被作为对象的野兽所以很难逃出它们的掌握。
    狮子是比较易养的动物，在动物园里也能繁殖，母狮三四岁后怀孕，一胎能产二—四仔，寿命二十多岁。狮子的性情在猛兽中也是比较易驯的，大马戏团里常教它们演戏，当狮子张开大嘴时，表演的人可以探头进去，不伤毫发。
    狮子的吼声很惊人，它们每到傍晚常起身吼叫，如果没有听过狮吼的人，蓦一听到雄狮的怒吼，会疑是地震山摇，声势的确雄壮之极。所以，佛经上把“狮子吼”比喻释迦牟尼——佛陀诞生时的初啼。狮子的吼叫一般还是猎食手段之一，据说它们隐在草里突袭其他动物之前，往往出其不意跳出来先作一声大吼，把那些动物惊呆了，再一扑，于是就稳在掌握了。
    狮子和老虎，人们都称为“百兽之王”，但是，谁是最强的？按体重、身长等等比较，它们似乎都不相上下。到现在为止还没有一个好事者让它们来一场比赛，看看这个王位究应属谁。倒是在外国已经有人把雄狮和雌虎配成了夫妇。“尔雅”里说：“狻麑”似“虦猫，食虎豹”，所以在我们民间一般把狮子更看重些。其实，野象和犀牛都要比狮、虎强得多，据说非洲的一头犀牛能击败三四头狮子，不过野象和犀牛都不是食肉兽，所以它们并不伤害其他动物（除非别的野兽先去攻击它们），也不在兽群里逞雄。
    我国不出产狮子，狮子来到我国的也很少，据历史上记载最早来到内地的狮子，大概要数一千八百多年前后汉顺帝时由西域疏勒进贡的一头了。但是，人们长久以来对狮子的形象很熟悉，也很感兴趣。宫殿、寺庙、牌楼以及大住宅、老店铺前面都有一对铜铸的或石雕的大狮子。有的房背上也安放有小狮子。香炉上也有狮子。陶瓷器上也有狮子，图章的印钮上也有狮子，民间刺绣、剪纸也有狮子，货物商标也有不少用狮子，新年里儿童们玩的有狮灯。民间文艺活动中有舞狮（或称跳狮子）。在少数民族地区，内蒙古、西藏喇嘛寺的神座、壁画和跳神中都有狮子、内蒙古牧民的象棋中还有狮子，妇女的头饰上和绣的烟包上也有狮子。
    但是，毕竟我们不是出产狮子的国家，过去的艺术家们难得见过真狮子，所以在造型上尽有不少刻画得很雄壮、细致的，但和真狮子的形象事实上还有一定的距离，不过这种造型长久以来已经成为我国传统的艺术风格。另外在它的造型上还有一个特点，是在它的前脚下常配有一个绣球，因此对它也就增加了不少的风趣。（附图片）
