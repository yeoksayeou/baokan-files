Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 4th: A Czech News Agency correspondent in Budapest reported on the production situation of industrial enterprises in Budapest after the New Year.

　　On January 2nd, 25,000 workers were working at Budapest's largest Csepel Metallurgical Factory. The electricity supply had improved somewhat, but there was still a shortage of coal. Therefore, the workers' committee of the Csepel factory is discussing the supply of coal with the Komló, Tatabánya, and Dorog coal mines. The branch of the Hungarian Young Communist League in the factory intends to send work teams to work in these coal mines.

　　The situation at the Befenjannis Electric Factory is also constantly improving. On January 2nd, 90% of all workers were at work, with production reaching approximately 80% of its previous output. The factory's products, especially telephones and radios, are again being exported to people's democratic countries, especially to China.

　　On January 2nd, almost all the workers at the Ganz factory, which produces electric motors, were on duty, with output reaching 80% of its previous level.

　　The EMG factory, which produces agricultural machinery, still faces considerable difficulties in electricity supply. Despite this, since the events of last October, the factory has produced nearly thirty combine harvesters for domestic use and is currently producing two hundred combine harvesters ordered by Yugoslavia.

    布达佩斯许多工厂
    新年后生产有改善
    据新华社布拉格4日电　捷克斯洛伐克通讯社驻布达佩斯记者报道了布达佩斯工业企业在新年后的生产情况。
    布达佩斯最大的切佩尔冶金工厂1月2日有二万五千名工人工作。电力供应有了一些改善，但是仍旧缺少煤，因此切佩尔工厂的工人委员会正在同柯姆洛煤矿、托托巴尼奥煤矿和多罗哥煤矿商谈煤的供应问题，匈牙利青年联盟在这个工厂的支部打算派工作队到这些煤矿去工作。
    贝芬扬尼斯电器工厂的情况也在不断改善。在1月2日，全体工人中有90％在工作，生产大约达到以前产量的80％。这家工厂的产品，特别是电话和收音机又在向人民民主国家，特别是向中国输出了。
    在1月2日，生产电机的“甘兹”工厂差不多全体工人都上了班，产量达到以前的80％。
    生产农业机器的“埃马格”工厂在电力供应方面仍然遇到相当大的困难。尽管这样，可是自从去年十月事件发生以来，这个工厂为国内生产了差不多三十台收获联合机，目前正在生产南斯拉夫订购的二百台收获联合机。
