Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 24th. Workers in Tianjin's local industries, in discussing this year's national plan, focused on key production issues and proposed measures to increase production and practice economy, which powerfully broke down the conservative thinking of some cadres.

    The Zhonghua Match Factory's profit target set by the state this year is 990,000 yuan. The factory leadership's calculations showed they could only reach 830,000 yuan. Therefore, the factory leaders felt that the target set by the state was too high and asked the higher authorities to reduce the plan. However, after the target was communicated to the workers and discussed, they proposed 150 technical measures such as saving wood, reducing waste stems, and using substitutes, which would enable the annual profit to reach 1,010,000 yuan. The leadership of the New Tianjin Printing and Dyeing Factory asked each workshop to reduce its expenses compared to last year. The workshop cadres emphasized that there would be major repairs this year and that it would be impossible to reduce expenses. Later, the factory handed over the 34 major repair tasks for this year to the workers for discussion. As a result, 31 of them could be done with old and waste materials without spending money, and two of them would only cost half of what was planned. The total repair cost was originally planned to be more than 100,000 yuan, but now it will only cost 35,000 yuan.

    Some factory leaders, because they have a relatively clear idea of relying on the workers, told everyone about the difficulties from the beginning of the plan formulation and worked together to find solutions, which has yielded good results. The Tianjin Electrolytic Copper Plant has great production potential, but the state-assigned task for this year is small, and the quality of raw materials has also decreased, which affects cost reduction. The factory leaders told the workers about this situation and went to the workshops separately to find waste with the workers, calculate detailed accounts, and formulated 78 technical measures, which are expected to reduce the annual cost by 1.19%. The implementation of a measure to recover electrolyte from anode mud in the electrolysis workshop alone can recover 12 tons of copper and more than 50 tons of sulfuric acid annually, worth more than 70,000 yuan. In addition, it can also recover 640 taels of gold and 700 taels of silver.

    The workers in many factories have paid attention to saving from small things. Workers at the Tianjin Rubber Hose Factory suggested reducing the thickness of the tube wall. After two tests, the physical performance of the product was very good. It is estimated that 176 tons of mixed rubber can be saved annually after implementation. With these raw materials, products worth more than 730,000 yuan can be produced. Workers at the Zhonghua Match Factory suggested shortening the paper glued to the matchbox by 5 millimeters to avoid overlapping with the trademark, which can save 1,800 yuan per year. The Rongguang Soy Sauce Factory originally used iron caps for soy sauce bottles, costing 3 cents each. Now they are changed to corks, costing 5 li each, which can also save more than 23,000 yuan per year.

### 天津地方工业职工群众  积极提出增产节约办法

    天津地方工业职工群众
    积极提出增产节约办法
    新华社天津24日电　天津市地方工业职工在讨论今年国家计划中，围绕生产关键问题提出增产节约措施，有力地打破了某些干部的保守思想。
    中华火柴厂今年接受国家下达的上缴利润指标是九十九万元。工厂领导方面几次测算只能达到八十三万元。因此，厂的领导干部认为国家下达的指标偏高，要求上级削减计划。但是，当这个指标告诉了职工并经过讨论以后，他们提出了节约木材、减少废梗、采用代用品等一百五十项技术措施，使全年的上缴利润可以达到一百零一万元。新天津印染厂领导方面要求各车间的经费能够比去年降低。车间干部强调今年有大修理任务，认为没法降低。后来，工厂把今年的三十四项大修理任务交给职工讨论，结果有三十一项可以用旧料、废料来做，不用花钱，有两项花的钱只需要计划的一半；全部修理费用，原计划需要十万多元，现在只要三万五千元就够了。
    有些工厂的领导干部因为有着比较明确的依靠职工的思想，从制订计划开始就把困难情况告诉大家，共同想办法，因此收到了很好的效果。天津市电解铜厂生产潜力大，今年国家下达的任务小，原料质量也降低了，影响降低成本。工厂领导干部把这种情况告诉职工并分头深入车间，和职工一起找浪费，算细账，订出了七十八项技术措施，预计全年成本可以降低1.19％。仅电解车间从阳极泥中回收电解液的一项措施实行后，全年就能回收铜十二吨，硫酸五十多吨，价值七万多元，此外，还能回收黄金六百四十两，白银七百两。
    许多工厂的职工都注意了从小处着手节约。天津市胶管厂职工建议把管壁厚度减薄。这个建议经过两次试验，产品的物理性能很好，预计实现以后全年可以节约混合胶一百七十六吨，用这些原料可以增产产值七十三万多元的产品。中华火柴厂工人建议把火柴盒上粘的纸减短五公厘，避免同商标重合，全年可以节约一千八百元。光荣酱油厂的酱油瓶原来用铁盖，每个三分钱，现在改为软木塞，每个五厘，全年也可以节约二万三千多元。
