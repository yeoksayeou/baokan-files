Xinhua News Agency, Calcutta, January 30th – Premier Zhou Enlai said at a press conference in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, on the morning of the 29th, before leaving, that China's proposal to hold a meeting of the foreign ministers of China and the United States is still valid. He said that, however, because China's repeated proposals on this issue have been met with a very cold reception from the United States, China is unwilling to be rejected again by the US government.

Premier Zhou Enlai made these remarks in response to a question about whether he would again suggest holding a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting on the friendly soil of Nepal. Zhou Enlai said, "If you ask us whether we still support this proposal, the answer is yes, not only on the friendly soil of Nepal, but also on any other soil."

Regarding whether he would suggest holding such a meeting in a place other than Geneva, such as New Delhi, given that the Sino-US talks in Geneva have not made any progress, Zhou Enlai said, "The question is best addressed to Mr. Dulles" because China made this suggestion a long time ago and has repeatedly made it, but has not received any positive response.

At the seventy-minute press conference held at the State Guesthouse, most of the time was spent answering questions from representatives of the Indian press and Reuters regarding China and the United States. Zhou Enlai's answers were translated into English and Nepali.

An Indian journalist said that a friendly gesture of releasing the Americans imprisoned in China would change the American attitude towards China. Zhou Enlai gave a detailed answer to all aspects of this issue. He said that Prime Minister Nehru's recent visit to the United States could be said to be a friendly attitude towards the United States. He said, "But what was the result?" He mentioned the proposal on Kashmir initiated by the United States and four other countries.

When asked if he thought this was a lesson, Zhou Enlai said, "Yes," but he disagreed with the notion that the American attitude determined China's policy towards American prisoners. He said: "The Chinese government's policy towards American prisoners is a matter of Chinese law. The Chinese government has repeatedly announced that it will decide its attitude towards prisoners based on their performance, that is to say, they may be released before the expiration of their sentences. This is our fixed policy and will not be affected by American policy.”

Zhou Enlai said that he had said in Delhi that he found it "very strange" that the US government confused this issue with the issue of improving relations between the United States and China.

He continued: "Even if we combine these two issues according to Mr. Eisenhower's views, we can easily see whether it is China or the United States that hopes to improve relations between the two countries."

Premier Zhou pointed out that thirty-four of the forty-four American criminals had been released. However, of the thirty-four Chinese detained in American prisons announced by the US government, only one has been released.

Premier Zhou then spoke about the Sino-US ambassadorial talks in Geneva, which have been going on for a year and a half. He said that the first issue on the agenda, namely the repatriation of civilians of the two countries, was quickly agreed upon after the start of the talks. However, on the second item, although we have made many suggestions to try to meet the US side's opinions, these suggestions have been rejected. As a result, the Geneva talks have reached a stalemate.

Zhou Enlai said: "This proves that the United States always hopes that others will make concessions, while it is unwilling to make any concessions itself. This is the reason why a compromise cannot be reached. Only when both sides move forward can they shake hands. But the United States refuses to shake it even when we have extended our hand."

When a Reuters reporter suggested exchanging the thirty-three imprisoned Chinese for the ten imprisoned Americans, Zhou Enlai smiled and said: "You are a good advisor, but the advisor's suggestions are for research and consideration. I will study this idea."

Zhou Enlai said in response to a question that he believed that Nehru's recent visit to the United States had hardly changed the American attitude towards China.

Premier Zhou asked the Nepali journalists to ask questions first. A Nepali journalist asked him about his impressions of his visit to Nepal. The Premier said that a four-day visit was too short even to see Kathmandu, and he did not have time to go outside Kathmandu. "But we are deeply impressed by the beautiful scenery, fertile land, traditional national culture, hardworking, brave and enthusiastic Nepali people. We are convinced that this country and this people will have a bright future." He thanked the King of Nepal, the Nepali people and Nepali government officials for their warm reception. "We are deeply moved by all this and will bring all these feelings back to China. I believe that the friendship between China and Nepal will continue to develop forever."

Someone asked Premier Zhou Enlai about the issue of setting up checkpoints on both sides of the border between China and Nepal. He said that checkpoints have indeed been set up at certain locations along the 1,000-kilometer border, and their purpose is to manage traffic. "We also think that they should be as few as possible. It would be best if they could be completely abolished. We also hope to simplify entry procedures at the border between the two countries, especially to provide more convenience for pilgrims." However, Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out, "There are some non-Nepali and non-Indian adventurers who want to spy on Tibet, although there is nothing to see. This cannot but make us vigilant."

Regarding the opening of air routes and road traffic between Kathmandu and Lhasa, Zhou Enlai said that this was a good idea, but it would take time and technical difficulties would have to be overcome.

Regarding whether differences of opinion between China, India, and Nepal would hinder Asian-African solidarity, Zhou Enlai said: "India, Nepal, and China do not have completely different views on the Hungarian issue. In fact, they have many views in common. Of course, there are also different opinions. But this difference, as Prime Minister Nehru has appropriately stated, is a friendly difference. They will never hinder the friendship and unity between Nepal, India, and China, nor will they hinder the solidarity of Asian and African countries." He said that, in addition, India and China both recognize the Kadar government. "I have been to Budapest. The situation there is getting better and better, and I believe it will become more stable."

Someone asked him to comment on the United Nations resolution on the Kashmir issue. Zhou Enlai said that he only started studying the Kashmir issue during this visit to South Asian countries. He has said several times that he wants to study this issue very carefully and is unwilling to answer casually.

But he said that he has repeatedly said that submitting this issue to the United Nations will not yield any good results. "I have sincerely advised India and Pakistan, these two sister countries, to sit down and discuss and resolve the issue themselves."

    在加德满都举行的记者招待会上
    周恩来总理谈中美关系
    中美会谈陷于僵局，证明美国老是希望别人让步，而自己却不想作任何让步
    新华社加尔各答30日电　周恩来总理29日上午在离开尼泊尔首都加德满都前，在记者招待会上说，中国提出的关于召开中美外交部长会议的建议仍然有效。他说，但是，由于中国一再就这个问题提出的建议遭到了美国的非常冷淡的对待，中国不愿再遭到美国政府的拒绝。
    周恩来总理是在回答关于他是否会在友好的尼泊尔土地上再次建议举行中美外长会议的问题时说这番话的。周恩来说，“如果你问我们，我们是否仍然支持这个建议，那么回答是肯定的，不仅在友好的尼泊尔土地上是这样，而且在任何其它土地上也是这样。”
    关于由于日内瓦的中美会谈并没有什么进展，他是否会建议在日内瓦以外的另外一个地方，譬如新德里，来举行这种会议的问题，周恩来说，“问题最好是向杜勒斯先生提”，因为中国很久以前就提出了这个建议，并且一再地提出，但是并没有得到任何肯定的答复。
    在国家大厦里举行的七十分钟的记者招待会上，大部分时间用于回答印度新闻界代表和路透社代表们提出的有关中国和美国的问题。周恩来的回答被译成英文和尼泊尔文。
    印度记者说，释放被监禁在中国的美国人的友好表示会改变美国对中国的态度，周恩来就这个问题的各个方面作了详细的回答。他说，尼赫鲁总理最近访问了美国，这可以说是向美国表示了友好态度。他说，“但是结果怎样呢？”他提到美国和其它四个国家发起的关于克什米尔的提案。
    在问到他是否认为这是一个教训时，周恩来说：“是的”，但是，他不同意所谓美国的态度决定了中国对美国犯人的政策的说法。他说：“中国政府对美国犯人的政策是中国的法律问题。中国政府已经一再宣布，它将根据犯人的表现来决定对他们的态度，那就是说，可能在他们刑满前释放他们。这是我们的固定政策，决不受美国政策的影响。”
    周恩来说，他在德里说过，他感到“非常奇怪的”是美国政府把这个问题同改善美国和中国关系的问题混淆起来。
    他继续说：“即令我们根据艾森豪威尔先生的看法把这两个问题合在一起来看，我们也能够很容易地看出希望改善两国之间的关系的究竟是中国，还是美国。”
    周总理指出，在四十四名美国罪犯中，已有三十四名获得释放。但是，在美国政府所宣布的拘禁在美国监狱中的三十四名中国人中，只有一人获得释放。
    周总理接着谈到已经进行了一年半之久的日内瓦中美大使会谈的问题。他说，议程上的第一个问题，也就是遣返两国平民的问题，在会谈开始后就很快地达成了协议。但在第二个项目上，尽管我们提出了许多建议来设法迎接美方的意见，然而，这些建议都被拒绝了。因此，日内瓦会谈陷于僵局。
    周恩来说：“这证明美国老是希望别人让步，而自己却不想作任何让步。这就是不能达成妥协的原因。只有双方向前走，他们才能握手。但是美国却甚至在我们伸出了手的时候也拒绝握它。”
    当路透社记者建议三十三个被监禁的中国人同十个被监禁的美国人交换的时候，周恩来微笑说：“你是个很好的顾问，但是顾问的建议是供研究和考虑的。我将研究这个主意。”
    周恩来在回答问题时又说，他认为尼赫鲁最近的美国之行几乎没有改变美国对中国的态度。
    周总理请尼泊尔记者首先提问题。尼泊尔记者问他访问尼泊尔的印象。总理说，四天的访问即使要看看加德满都也太短了，他没有时间到加德满都以外的地方去。“但是我们对美丽的景色、肥沃的土地、传统的民族文化、勤劳勇敢和热心的尼泊尔人民印象很深。我们确信这种国家和这种人民将有光辉的前途。”他感谢尼泊尔国王、尼泊尔人民和尼泊尔政府官员的热烈招待。“我们对这一切深为感动，并且将把这一切感情带回中国。我相信中国和尼泊尔之间的友谊将永远发展下去。”
    有人向周恩来总理提出关于中国和尼泊尔的边境的两边都设有检查站的问题。他说，在沿着一千公里长的边境的某些地点的确设立有检查站，其目的是为了管理交通。“我们也认为它们应当尽量少一些。如果能够完全取消，那是最好了。我们也希望在两国之间的边境简化入境手续，特别是对香客给予更多的便利。”但是，周恩来总理指出，“有一些非尼泊尔的和非印度的冒险家想窥伺西藏，虽然并没有什么可看的。这不能不使我们保持警惕。”
    关于开辟加德满都与拉萨之间的航线和公路交通的问题，周恩来说，这是一个好主意，但是这需要时间，而且必须克服技术上的困难。
    对于中国、印度和尼泊尔三国之间意见上的不同是否会妨碍亚非团结的问题，周恩来说：“印度、尼泊尔和中国三国之间对于匈牙利问题的看法并不是完全不同的。事实上，它们有很多看法是共同的。当然，也有不同的意见。但是这种不同正像尼赫鲁总理所恰当地说明的，是友好的不同。它们决不会妨碍尼泊尔、印度和中国三国之间的友好和团结，也不会妨碍亚非国家的团结。”他说，此外，印度和中国都承认卡达尔政府。“我到布达佩斯去过。那里的情况正愈来愈好，我相信它将更加稳定。”
    有人请他就联合国对克什米尔问题的决议发表意见，周恩来说，他在这次访问南亚国家的时候才开始研究克什米尔问题。他已经说过好几次，他要很仔细地研究这个问题，不愿意随便作答。
    但是他说，他曾经一再说过，把这个问题提交联合国是得不到什么良好的结果的。“我曾经诚恳地劝印度和巴基斯坦这两个姊妹国家自己坐下来讨论和解决问题。”
