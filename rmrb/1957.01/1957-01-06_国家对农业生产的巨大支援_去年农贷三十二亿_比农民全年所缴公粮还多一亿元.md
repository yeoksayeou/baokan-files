Xinhua News Agency, 5th: In 1956, the state provided farmers with a large amount of agricultural loans, which strongly supported agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production. According to statistics at the end of November, the cumulative amount of agricultural loans issued nationwide (including those issued in 1956 and those issued in previous years that have not yet been recovered) has exceeded 3.2 billion yuan. This is 100 million yuan more than the money converted from the public grain (including local surcharges) paid by farmers to the state in 1956.

　　Of this huge amount of loans, more than 600 million yuan were poverty-stricken farmers' cooperative fund loans. These more than 600 million yuan were distributed to approximately 30% of agricultural cooperative members to help them solve the problem of lacking cooperative share funds. According to statistics from fifteen provinces including Hebei, Henan, and Sichuan, more than 19.6 million cooperative members received poverty-stricken farmers' cooperative fund loans, averaging 20 yuan per household. The remaining agricultural loans were mainly used to help agricultural cooperatives build water conservancy projects, purchase new agricultural tools, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and other means of production, and a portion was used to help farmers overcome difficulties in their lives. In 1956, despite suffering from severe water, drought, wind, and other disasters, the national grain crops and cash crops such as cotton, oilseeds, and sugar crops still increased in production compared to 1955, which is inseparable from the state's strong economic assistance to farmers. In disaster-stricken areas, in addition to providing relief funds to disaster victims, the state also provided production disaster relief loans to help them rebuild their homes and engage in production for self-salvation. According to preliminary statistics from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Hunan, Hebei, Heilongjiang, and other provinces at the end of October, the production disaster relief loans issued have reached more than 120 million yuan.

    国家对农业生产的巨大支援
    去年农贷三十二亿
    比农民全年所缴公粮还多一亿元
    新华社5日讯　1956年国家给农民发放大量农业贷款，有力地支援了农业合作化和农业生产。据11月底的统计，全国发放农业贷款的累计数（包括1956年发放的和以前几年发放尚未收回的部分）已经超过三十二亿元。这比1956年农民向国家缴纳的公粮（包括地方附加）折钱，还多一亿元。
    在这笔数量巨大的贷款中，有六亿多元是贫农合作基金贷款。这六亿多元发放给大约30％的农业社社员，帮助他们解决了缺少入社股份基金的问题。据河北、河南、四川等十五个省的统计，有一千九百六十多万户社员得到了贫农合作基金贷款，平均每户得到了二十元。其余的农业贷款主要是用来帮助农业社兴修水利，购买新式农具、种子、肥料、农药等各种生产资料，一部分用来帮助农民克服生活上的困难。1956年在遭到严重的水、旱、风等灾害的情况下，全国粮食作物和棉花、油料、糖料等经济作物仍都比1955年增产，是和国家在经济上大力援助农民分不开的。在受灾地区，国家对灾民除了发放救济款以外，还给予生产救灾贷款，帮助他们重建家园，生产自救。据江苏、浙江、安徽、河南、湖南、河北、黑龙江等省10月底的初步统计，贷出的生产救灾贷款已达一亿二千多万元。
