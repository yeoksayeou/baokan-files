    Wu Xing County Diligent Agricultural Cooperative
    Large-Scale Bumper Harvest of Freshwater Fish

    (Our Newspaper) News: The Diligent Agricultural Cooperative in Wu Xing County, Zhejiang Province, has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of freshwater fish, with the average yield per mu reaching over one thousand jin for the entire cooperative.

    The Diligent Agricultural Cooperative, which received a model worker award for freshwater fisheries from the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee in 1955, raised fish in a 141-mu large fish pond in 1956. The average yield per mu was 1,037 jin, an increase of 32.6% compared to the 782 jin per mu in 1955, and 72.6% higher than the 595 jin per mu of nearby cooperatives. It exceeded the original plan by 9.1%. The highest yield per mu reached 1,390 jin, setting a new record for freshwater fish production in the province.

    According to Cooperative Director Shen Abing, the main reasons for the large-scale bumper harvest of freshwater fish in the Diligent Agricultural Cooperative are the comprehensive promotion of advanced fish farming techniques and experience, and the adoption of mixed breeding and dense stocking. Last year, the cooperative averaged 654 fish fry per mu, an increase of 16.3% compared to 1955, with an increase of 21% in bottom-dwelling fish. Scientific disease prevention experience was comprehensively promoted, including the use of lime for pond cleaning, baking soda for seed soaking, bleaching powder for disinfection, and advanced techniques such as timed, quantitative, qualitative, and localized feeding methods. In addition, winter stocking of fish fry and regular introduction of fresh water in summer and autumn were also important reasons for increased production.

    吴兴县勤劳农业社
    淡水鱼大面积丰产
    本报讯　浙江省吴兴县勤劳农业社淡水鱼大面积丰收，全社平均每亩产量达到千斤以上。
    曾获得浙江省人民委员会1955年淡水渔业劳模奖励的勤劳农业社，1956年在一百四十一亩的大鱼塘里养的鱼，平均每亩产鱼一千零三十七斤，比1955年的亩产七百八十二斤提高了32.6％，比附近的社亩产五百九十五斤提高了72.6％，超额完成了原计划9.1％。其中最高的每亩产量达到一千三百九十斤，创造了全省淡水鱼产量的最高纪录。
    勤劳农业社淡水鱼大面积丰收的原因据社长沈阿炳说，主要是全面推广了养鱼的先进技术和经验，采用了混养密育。全社去年平均每亩放养鱼种六百五十四尾，比1955年增加16.3％，其中底层鱼类增加21％。全面推广了科学防病经验；采用石灰清塘、小苏打浸种、漂白粉消毒和进行定时、定量、定质、定位的投饲方法等先进技术。此外，隔冬放养鱼种、夏秋季节定期车入新水，也是增产的重要原因。
