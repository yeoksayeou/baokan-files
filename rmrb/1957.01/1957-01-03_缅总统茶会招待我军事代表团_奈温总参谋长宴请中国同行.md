Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 2nd: Burmese President Ba U held a tea party at the Presidential Palace on January 1st to welcome the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation headed by Ye Jianying.

Among those present at the tea party were Burmese Deputy Chief of Staffs Kyaw Zaw and Dan Pe, as well as Burmese Ambassador to China U Hla Maung, and others.

Chinese Ambassador to Burma Yao Zhongming was also invited to attend the tea party.

The one-hour tea party was filled with a friendly atmosphere.

That morning, Burmese Prime Minister U Ba Swe received the delegation at the Prime Minister's Office. Also present at the meeting were Kyaw Zaw, U Hla Maung, and Yao Zhongming.

That morning, the delegation laid a wreath at the Aung San Mausoleum, visited the world-famous Shwedagon Pagoda, and watched boat races at Aung San Park.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 2nd: General Ne Win, Chief of Staff of the Burmese Defense Forces, hosted a banquet on the evening of January 1st to entertain the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation headed by Marshal Ye Jianying.

Among those attending the banquet were Burmese Deputy Chief of Staff (Air Force) Kyaw Zaw and Deputy Chief of Staff (Navy) Dan Pe, senior officers of the Burmese Armed Forces, Chinese Ambassador to Burma Yao Zhongming, Burmese Ambassador to China U Hla Maung, and military attachés from various countries' embassies in Rangoon.

In his speech, General Ne Win said that this was the first, but not the last, visit of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to Burma. He hoped to promote the relationship between the armed forces of the two countries and hoped that this relationship would become closer.

General Ne Win emphasized that if there were problems between the two countries, they could be resolved through negotiations. He said that there were no major problems between China and Burma. He agreed with Premier Zhou Enlai and Marshal Ye Jianying on this point.

General Ne Win finally raised his glass for the consolidation of Sino-Burmese friendship and the friendship between the armed forces of the two countries.

In his speech, Marshal Ye Jianying said that although the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation was visiting Burma for the first time, they had long been deeply impressed by the heroic deeds of the Burmese armed forces in the anti-fascist and anti-colonial struggles. He said that the armed forces of China and Burma, which grew and strengthened in the battle for the independence and freedom of their own countries, naturally find it easier to have mutual sympathy, understanding, and friendship in spirit. In order to defend and consolidate the independence of our two countries, we have a common determination to adhere to the Five Principles jointly established by the leaders of our two countries and the leaders of the Indian government. Under these principles, our two countries not only have close economic and cultural ties and cooperation, but also have broad prospects for developing eternal friendship between our two armies.

Marshal Ye Jianying pointed out that the visit to China by the Burmese Military Friendship Delegation led by General Ne Win in 1955 was extremely successful in enhancing the friendship between the armed forces of our two countries and left a deep and good impression on the people and army of our country.

Marshal Ye Jianying said that the purpose of the Chinese Military Delegation's visit to Burma this time is to convey the respect and friendship of the Chinese people and army to the Burmese people and army, and at the same time to learn from their Burmese counterparts.

At the banquet, the guests repeatedly toasted friendship and peace. After the banquet, everyone watched Burmese music and dance performances.

    新华社仰光2日电　缅甸总统巴宇1月1日下午在总统府举行茶会，欢迎以叶剑英为首的中国军事友好代表团。
    出席茶会的有缅甸副总参谋长克利夫特和丹佩，以及缅甸驻中国大使吴拉茂等。
    中国驻缅甸大使姚仲明也应邀出席了茶会。
    历时一小时的茶会充满了友好的气氛。
    当天上午，缅甸总理吴巴瑞在总理府接见了代表团。接见时在座的有克利夫特、吴拉茂和姚仲明。
    代表团在当天上午曾经到昂山陵墓献花圈，参观了世界闻名的大金塔，并且在昂山公园看了赛船。
    新华社仰光2日电　缅甸国防军总参谋长奈温将军1日晚上举行宴会，招待以叶剑英元帅为首的中国军事友好代表团。
    参加宴会的有缅甸副总参谋长（空军）克利夫特和副总参谋长（海军）丹佩，缅甸武装部队高级军官，中国驻缅甸大使姚仲明和缅甸驻中国大使吴拉茂以及各国驻仰光使馆武官。
    奈温将军在讲话中说，这是中国军事友好代表团第一次而不是最后一次访问缅甸。他希望促进两国武装部队的关系，希望这种关系变得更加密切。
    奈温将军着重指出，如果两国之间有问题，可以通过谈判来解决。他说，中缅两国之间是没有什么大问题的。他同意周恩来总理和叶剑英元帅关于这方面的意见。
    奈温将军最后为中缅友谊和两国武装部队友谊的巩固而干杯。
    叶剑英元帅在讲话中说，中国军事友好代表团虽然是初次访问缅甸，但是他们对于缅甸武装部队在反法西斯主义、反殖民主义斗争中的英雄事迹早就有了深刻的印象。他说，在为自己祖国的独立自由的战斗中成长和壮大起来的中缅两国的武装部队，在精神上很自然地比较容易获得相互之间的同情，了解和友好。为了保卫和巩固我们两国各自的独立，我们有共同一致的决心来奉行我们两国领导人和印度政府领导人共同创立的五项原则。在这种原则下，我们两国不仅在经济上和文化上有着密切的联系和合作，而且在我们两国军队之间，也有着发展永恒友谊的广阔前途。
    叶剑英元帅指出1955年奈温将军所率领的缅甸军事友好代表团访问了中国，这在增进我们两国军队之间的友谊上获得了极其显著的成功，并且给我国人民和军队留下了深刻而良好的印象。
    叶剑英元帅说，中国军事代表团这次来缅甸访问，就是要向缅甸人民和军队转达中国人民和军队对他们的敬意和友情，同时还要向缅甸同行们学习。
    在宴会上，宾主一再为友谊和和平而干杯。宴会结束后，大家观看了缅甸音乐和舞蹈表演。
