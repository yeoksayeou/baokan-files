    British and French News Agencies' Organizations in Egypt
    Egyptian Government Orders Cancellation
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 4th - Egyptian Minister of Finance, Kayshuni, issued an order on January 1st to definitively cancel the offices of Agence France-Presse (AFP) and the British-run Arab News Agency in Cairo.
    Kayshuni said that the activities of these two news agencies were not in line with Egypt's national interests.
    The offices of these two news agencies in Cairo have been sealed since the British and French launched their attack on Egypt last year.
    On August 27th of last year, Egyptian authorities arrested the director of the Arab News Agency, the British citizen James Swinburne, because he was the head of British espionage activities in Egypt. The Arab News Agency has offices in most Arab countries.

    英法通讯社在埃机构
    埃及政府下令取消
    新华社开罗4日电　埃及财政部长凯舒尼1日下令最后取消了法新社和英国人办的阿拉伯通讯社驻开罗的办事处。
    凯舒尼说，这两家通讯社的活动是不符合埃及的民族利益的。
    自从英法去年对埃及发动进攻以来，这两家通讯社在开罗的办事处就一直是被查封的。
    去年8月27日，埃及当局曾经逮捕阿拉伯通讯社的社长、英国人詹姆斯·斯温布恩，因为他是英国在埃及从事间谍活动的头子。阿拉伯通讯社在大多数阿拉伯国家中都设有办事处。
