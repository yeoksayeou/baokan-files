Xinhua News Agency, January 15th—According to a report by the Hungarian News Agency, an article published in “People’s Freedom” on the 13th stated that Hungary’s most important economic task at present is to avoid inflation.

    The article pointed out that the harbingers of inflation are already visible: there is a lack of certain industrial products, commodity reserves have been greatly reduced, and the total amount of currency in the hands of residents has increased by 20%. In addition, due to wage increases and the abolition of the compulsory sale of grain, residents' purchasing power will increase by 10 billion forints in 1957, an increase of 20% compared to last year. Therefore, to avoid inflation, it is necessary to provide more goods for everyone.

    When discussing ways to avoid the danger of inflation, the article pointed out that production reductions caused by a lack of motivation must be addressed with large-scale layoffs. Personnel must be cut in administrative agencies, and state institutions must be streamlined. The article believes that this is painful, but ultimately in the interests of the entire working class. In addition, this year's investment must be reduced by 50% compared to last year, and exports of daily consumer goods must be cut. In the past, 30% to 40% of daily consumer goods were exported. These exports must be reduced to 15%.

    The article continued: While reducing exports, imports must be increased, and this can only be achieved by borrowing from foreign countries. These loans can primarily only be obtained from friendly countries. Our successful negotiations have allowed us to expect substantial loans. The government has announced several times that we are also willing to accept long-term loans from capitalist countries that do not have political strings attached. However, it should be clear that we will have to repay these loans sooner or later.

    After taking the above measures, inflation can be avoided. However, everything will depend on our production—especially coal and power production—and our labor discipline.

    The article said: Even if inflation is avoided, there should be no illusions. 1957 will be an extremely difficult year. The article also pointed out: Hungary's economic situation today is much better than it was in 1945-46. We have a developed socialist industry, our socialist trade and banking system can overcome speculation, and our national bank will guarantee the continued provision of needed funds.

    匈“人民自由报”载文分析经济情况
    当前重要任务是避免通货膨胀
    新华社15日讯　据匈牙利通讯社报道，“人民自由报”13日登载的一篇文章说，匈牙利目前经济方面最重要的任务就是避免通货膨胀。
    文章指出，现在已经可以看到通货膨胀的先兆：某些工业品缺乏、商品储备大大减少、居民手中的货币总量已经增加了20％。此外，由于提高工资和取消粮食的义务交售制等，居民的购买力在1957年将增加一百亿福林，比去年增加20％。因此，要避免通货膨胀，就必须为大家供给更多的商品。
    文章在谈到避免通货膨胀的危险的办法时指出，由于缺乏动力而引起的生产缩减，必须实行大量解雇。必须在行政机构中裁减人员，精简国家机构。文章认为，这样作是令人苦痛的，但终究是符合于整个工人阶级的利益的。此外，还必须把今年的投资比去年减少50％，削减日用消费品的出口。在过去，日用消费品中有30％到40％出口。这些出口必须减到15％。
    文章接着说：在减少出口的同时，必须增加进口量，而这只有向外国借款才有可能做到。这些贷款首先只能得自友好的国家。我们已经进行的有成果的谈判使我们可以指望得到大量贷款。政府曾经几次宣布我们也愿意从资本主义国家接受不附带政治条件的长期贷款。但是，应该看明白这些贷款，我们迟早是要偿还的。
    在采取了上述各项措施之后，就可以避免通货膨胀。但是，一切将取决于我们的生产——特别是煤和动力的生产——和我们的劳动纪律。
    文章说：即使做到避免通货膨胀，也决不要存有幻想。1957年将是极为艰苦的一年。文章同时又指出：匈牙利今天的经济情况比1945—46年的情况要好得多。我们拥有一个发达的社会主义工业，我们的社会主义贸易和银行制度能够克服投机，我们的国家银行将保证继续提供所需的资金。
