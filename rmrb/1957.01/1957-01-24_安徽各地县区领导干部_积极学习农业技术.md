Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, January 23rd: Two hundred and twenty-five county Party secretaries, county heads, heads of rural work departments of county Party committees, district Party secretaries, or cadres at the level of district Party secretaries from Anhui Province, started a week-long study session on agricultural technology at the agricultural technology training class held by the Rural Work Department of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee yesterday. Here, they will learn basic knowledge of rice cultivation techniques, double-cropping rice seedling cultivation, and rational crop arrangement.

The Rural Work Department of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee has already held two sessions of this kind of training class, training nearly five hundred people, including heads of rural work departments of county Party committees, heads of county agricultural bureaus, resident cadres and chairmen of large cooperatives, and agricultural technical cadres of special districts and counties.

In 1956, Anhui Province promoted double-cropping rice on a large scale. However, some county and district cadres did not understand production, and violated the principle of adapting to local conditions and blindly copied methods, resulting in reduced production and causing farmers to doubt double-cropping rice. In order to enable county and district cadres to understand the technology of growing double-cropping rice and avoid similar mistakes in this year's promotion work, the Rural Work Department of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee held this training class.

    安徽各地县区领导干部
    积极学习农业技术
    新华社合肥23日电　安徽省二百二十五个中共县委书记、县长、县委农村工作部长、中共区委书记，或相当于区委书记级的干部，昨天在中共安徽省委农村工作部举办的农业技术训练班开始了为期一周的学习。在这里，他们将学到水稻栽培技术、双季稻的育秧和合理安排茬口等基本知识。
    中共安徽省委农村工作部已经举办过两期这种训练班，训练了县委农村工作部长，县农业局长，大社驻社干部、社长，专区和县的农业技术干部等近五百人。
    安徽省在1956年大面积推广了双季稻。但是有些县区干部不懂生产，违背了因时因地制宜的原则，照搬硬套，招致了减产，引起了农民对于双季稻的怀疑。为了让县区干部懂得种植双季稻的技术，在今年的推广工作中不再犯类似错误，中共安徽省委农村工作部才举办了这个训练班。
