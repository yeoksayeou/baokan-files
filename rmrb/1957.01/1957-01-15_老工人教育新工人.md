    Old Workers Educate New Workers

    (Reported by this newspaper) Recently, the Beijing No. 2 State-owned Cotton Mill organized old workers to introduce to new workers the situation of the working class being oppressed and exploited in the old society, to raise the class consciousness of the new workers, and to educate the new workers to carry forward the style of hard work and plain living.

    More than 80% of the workers in the No. 2 State-owned Cotton Mill are young, new workers. After entering the factory, most of them work very actively, can study conscientiously, and quickly master the technology. However, some workers despise labor, do not abide by labor discipline, and pay attention to enjoyment. Some clamor for status and compete for treatment. Some only care about eating well and dressing well, regardless of the old and the young. Some people are not satisfied even with grade A dishes, but when their mothers come to ask for money, they only give them 50 cents and send them away. Some people look for a spouse and first see if they have status or money. Some even openly say: "If I want to get married, I have to be given two sets of bedding, and I have to buy a clock and a dressing table." Because of this bad trend among some new workers, the atmosphere of learning technology and studying production is relatively weakened. Some people are afraid of gossip and dare not be simple even if they want to be.

    In order to educate the new workers to carry forward the style of hard work and plain living, the leaders of this factory organized report meetings and forums, and invited old workers to talk about the difficult situation in the past. Sun Shu'e, an old worker in the fine spinning workshop, painfully recalled her life in the old society at the forum. She said: "I was an apprentice at the age of thirteen. The money I earned at that time was not enough to support my family, let alone support myself. I didn't dare to ask for leave even if I was sick, because if I asked for leave, I would lose my job. Labor insurance was something I had never even heard of... Comparing now with the past, it's like going to heaven!" Many young workers were greatly moved after hearing the reports of the old workers. Some people who used to be often late or early are now not late anymore. Some people who are not good at arranging their lives have begun to change. Now the phenomenon of violating labor discipline such as being late and absent from work in this factory has been greatly reduced, and the attendance rate has also increased compared to before. The phenomenon of wasting food in the canteen has also decreased.

### 老工人教育新工人

    老工人教育新工人
    本报讯　最近，北京国棉二厂组织老工人向新工人介绍在旧社会里工人阶级被压迫、被剥削的情形，提高新工人的阶级觉悟，教育新工人发扬艰苦朴素的作风。
    国棉二厂的工人，有80％以上都是青年的新工人。他们进厂以后，大部分工作很积极，能够认真学习，很快地掌握技术。但是，也有一些工人轻视劳动、不遵守劳动纪律，讲究享受。有的闹地位，争待遇。有的只顾自己吃得好穿得好，不顾老的和小的。有的人，甲等菜还嫌不过瘾，而母亲来要钱，只给了五角钱就打发走了。有的人找爱人，先看有没有地位、有没有钱。有的人甚至公开说：“我要结婚，得给我做两铺两盖，还得买坐钟、买梳妆台。”由于在一部分新工人中存在着这种不好的风气，学习技术、研究生产的空气就相对地削弱了。有的人害怕别人说闲话，想朴素也不敢朴素。
    这个厂的领导人为了教育新工人发扬艰苦朴素的作风，组织了报告会和座谈会，请老工人讲讲当年艰苦的情况。细纱车间老工人孙淑娥，在座谈会上沉痛地回忆了旧社会的生活。她说：“我十三岁就当徒工，那时候赚的钱，别说养家，连自己都养不活。有了病也不敢请假，因为一请假就要失业。劳动保险，更是听也没有听过的……拿现在同过去比，真好比上了天堂啊！”许多青年工人听到老工人的报告后，受到很大的感动。以前某些经常迟到早退的人，现在也不迟到了。个别不善于安排生活的人，开始有了转变。现在这个工厂迟到、旷工等违犯劳动纪律的现象大为减少，出勤率也比以前有所提高。食堂里浪费粮食的现象也减少了。
