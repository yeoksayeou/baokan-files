Advocate Hard Work and Plain Living, Oppose Extravagance and Waste

    Vice President Feng, a Model of Consistent Thrift

    In 1956, the Sichuan People's Art Theater demolished some houses to build rehearsal halls and used a few bedrooms as piano rooms. With the increase in personnel, the housing became even more inadequate. The theater's Vice President Feng Runting voluntarily gave up his best bedroom to new comrades, while he, his wife, children, and nanny shared two very small bedrooms. Under his influence, the head of the Personnel Section and others also devised various ways to free up some rooms, solving the problem of insufficient dormitory space.

    Comrade Feng Runting has always been diligent, thrifty and simple. Here's just one small example: For several years, he did not have a glass top on his desk, saying that the glass should be given to comrades who work with mimeograph stencils and carbon copies. It wasn't until 1956, when he was elected as an advanced worker of the first grade in the entire theater, that he accepted the glass top given to him by the organization as a prize.

    We need such thrifty cadres.
                    (Zheng Bowei)

    A Large Theater in a Small County Town

    In Changshan County, Zhejiang Province, a large theater that can accommodate a thousand people is about to be completed. It is said that this is the only new and beautiful theater of its kind in the entire special district.

    Changshan County's town, including babies, has only 13,200 people. According to past experience, the theater's daytime audience is only two or three hundred people, and the nighttime audience is only three or four hundred people. Even on Saturday nights, when there are more viewers, there are only six or seven hundred people. One wonders what the purpose is of building such a large theater.

    Director Zhang's Words and Actions

    On the afternoon of December 7, 1956, the Fengfeng Mining Bureau held a conference to launch the campaign to increase production and practice economy. At the meeting, Deputy Director Zhang of the Mining Bureau made an inspection report. He used specific materials to illustrate the serious waste phenomenon in the Mining Bureau. He also severely criticized the bourgeois ideology of some leading cadres who would not go to the factories without a car. He demanded that all cadres establish a style of hard work and plain living, sharing weal and woe with the masses, and resolutely struggle against the phenomenon of extravagance and waste.

    However, not two days after the meeting, the Youth Supervision Post criticized Deputy Director Zhang on the wall newspaper, saying that he should not have asked for a car to go to the No. 2 Mine. It turned out that the distance from the gate of the Mining Bureau to the gate of the No. 2 Mine was less than three hundred meters, and one could have walked to the No. 2 Mine in the time it took to get the car.

    Deputy Director Zhang demands that others establish a style of hard work and plain living, but it seems that he himself is an exception!

    Waste Amidst Calls for Thrift

    On November 26 and December 18 of last year, the Supreme People's Court spent 680 yuan to buy four noble and beautiful wardrobes with dressing mirrors. Then, on December 21, they hurriedly spent more than 200 yuan to buy five bathtubs. It is said that these things were bought for cadres at the level of bureau directors and above. Are they urgently needed? Take the wardrobes for example; as far as I know, every family of bureau director-level cadres has one, it's just that they are not as beautiful as the newly bought ones. Such waste should be opposed.
                      (Su Hongzhang)

    "Farewell Banquet"

    The Era Publishing House had a deputy director of the office who was recently transferred to the International Publishing House. Both publishing houses are under the leadership of the Publishing Bureau and are both in Beijing, just one in the Eastern District and one in the Western District. Such a job transfer is commonplace. However, the director of the Era Publishing House called on everyone to contribute money to hold a farewell banquet. Two tables were set up at the Cuihua Restaurant, and sixty-three yuan and sixty cents were spent in less than half an hour.

    Is it that friendship cannot be expressed deeply enough without a "farewell banquet"?
                    (Yu Jianzhong)

    提倡艰苦朴素　反对铺张浪费
    一贯俭朴的冯副院长
    1956年，四川人民艺术剧院拆掉了一些房子修盖排练场，又利用几间寝室做钢琴室，再加上人员的增加，房子越发不够用了。剧院的副院长冯润庭就主动地把自己住的最好的一间寝室让出来，给新来的同志住，自己和爱人孩子保姆则分住在两间很小的寝室里。在他的影响下，剧院的人事科长等也想出各种办法让出来一些房子，解决了宿舍不够的问题。
    冯润庭同志一贯勤俭朴素。这里只举一件小事：他的办公桌上几年来都没有玻璃板，他说应该把玻璃板让给刻腊版、写复写的同志们用。直到1956年他当选为全院一级先进工作者，才接受组织上作为奖品发给他的一块玻璃板。
    我们需要这样俭朴的干部。

    小县城的大戏院
    在浙江省常山县，一座可容千人的大戏院就要落成了。据说这是全专区独一无二新型漂亮的戏院。
    常山县城关镇连吃奶的小孩在内，只有一万三千二百多人，根据过去的情况，戏院的观众日场不过二、三百人，夜场也只有三、四百人，星期六的夜场观众较多，也不过六、七百人，但不知修造这样大的戏院做何用？
                    （巨　江）
    张副局长的言和行
    1956年12月7日下午，峰峰矿务局召开开展增产节约运动大会。在大会上，矿务局张副局长作了检查报告。他用具体材料说明了矿务局的严重浪费现象。他还严厉地批评了有些领导干部没汽车就不下厂的资产阶级思想作风。他要求所有的干部树立艰苦朴素与群众同甘共苦的作风，向铺张浪费的现象进行坚决的斗争。
    可是，会后没过两天，青年监督岗就在墙报上批评了张副局长，说他到二矿去不应该要汽车。原来矿务局的大门距二矿的大门还不到三百公尺，有要车的工夫走也走到二矿了。
    张副局长要求他人树立艰苦朴素作风，可是他自己似乎可以例外！
                    （泽　鸣）
    节约声中的浪费
    去年11月26日和12月18日，最高人民法院先后花了六百八十元买了四个既高贵又漂亮带有穿衣镜的衣柜。紧接着又于12月21日花了二百多元赶忙买了五个洗澡盆。据说，这些东西，都是买给司局长级以上干部用的。是否迫切需要呢？拿衣柜说，据我所知，司局长级的干部每家都有，只不过没有新买的漂亮罢了。如此浪费的现象，是应该反对的。

    “摆酒欢送”
    时代出版社有个办公室副主任，最近调到国际出版社工作。这两个出版社都在出版局领导下，都在北京市，只不过一个在东城，一个在西城。这样的调动工作本是常事。可是，时代出版社的社长却号召大家出钱，摆酒欢送。在萃华楼摆起了两桌酒席，不消半个时辰，花去了六十三元六毛。
    是不是不“摆酒欢送”就不足以表示友谊深厚呢？
