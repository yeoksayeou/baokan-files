Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Assembly plenary session on the 11th passed the resolution of the General Assembly Political Committee on the Korean issue. This resolution was proposed by the US representative.

The US proposal reiterates some "basic principles" that it has used for years to obstruct the resolution of the Korean issue, such as requiring so-called "free elections" in Korea under the supervision of the United Nations, a party to the Korean War.

The result of the General Assembly vote was fifty-seven in favor, eight against, and nine abstentions. The Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democracies voted against.

Soviet representative Tsarapkin and Czechoslovak representative Winkler spoke at the meeting, pointing out that the US proposal did not help resolve the Korean issue, and the United Nations had no right to supervise elections in all of Korea; only through an agreement between the two parts of Korea could Korea be reunified. The two representatives also condemned the Syngman Rhee clique of South Korea for inciting renewed war cries.

    联大非法通过美国关于朝鲜问题提案
    新华社12日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会全体会议11日通过了大会政治委员会关于朝鲜问题的决议，这项决议是美国代表提出的。
    美国的提案重申它几年来阻挠解决朝鲜问题的一些“基本原则”，例如，要求在朝鲜战争参加的一方——联合国的监督下在朝鲜举行所谓“自由选举”等。
    大会表决的结果是五十七票赞成，八票反对和九票弃权。投反对票的是苏联和东欧人民民主国家。
    苏联代表查拉普金和捷克斯洛伐克代表文克勒在会上发言指出，美国的提案无助于朝鲜问题的解决，联合国无权在全朝鲜监督选举；只有通过朝鲜两部分的协议，才能使朝鲜重新统一。两国代表还谴责南朝鲜李承晚集团重新挑起战争的叫嚣。
