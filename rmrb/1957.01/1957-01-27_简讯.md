    Brief News
    Cars Reach the Edge of the Tarim Basin
    On January 15th, a car departing from Ruoqiang, following the newly built simple road, reached Qiemo for the first time. Ruoqiang and Qiemo are both located on the southeastern edge of the Tarim Basin, 350 kilometers apart, with only difficult sandy terrain in between. In the past, people of all ethnic groups in the two counties relied entirely on camels, donkeys, and horses for transportation, taking a month for a round trip. Last year, about 4,000 laborers from the two counties spent more than four months building this road.

    Extending the Time for Tugging Double Barges on the Sichuan River
    Recently, the Chongqing Branch of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration decided to further lower the minimum water level for fleets tugging double barges during the dry season. This measure can extend the time for tugging double barges on the Sichuan River by at least three months, increasing freight revenue for the country by more than one million yuan.

    Using Open-Hearth Furnaces to Smelt Transformer Silicon Steel
    The experiment of using open-hearth furnaces to produce transformer silicon steel was recently successful at the Steelmaking Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. The two furnaces of steel smelted met the technical standards.
    It is the first time in China to use open-hearth furnaces to smelt transformer silicon steel. In the past, silicon steel was smelted in electric furnaces. Because electric furnaces are small and use electricity for smelting, not only are the costs high and the output low, but also the uniformity of the steel is not easily guaranteed. Smelting in open-hearth furnaces can eliminate these shortcomings and greatly increase output.

    Workshop for Manufacturing Organic Glass
    The synthetic monomer workshop for manufacturing organic glass, newly built by the Anli Chemical Factory in Suzhou through public-private partnership, officially went into production on the 22nd. This workshop directly uses chemical raw materials such as sodium cyanide, methanol, acetone, and sulfuric acid to manufacture organic glass, and can produce about 2,000 kilograms of organic glass per month.
    Organic glass, commonly known as unbreakable glass, is an indispensable raw material for manufacturing industries such as aviation, automobiles, and electrical appliances. Many common slide rules, set squares, factory protective equipment, and watch faces are made of organic glass. This type of glass is white, transparent, cold-resistant, and has high insulation properties.

    汽车开到塔里木盆地边缘
    1月15日，从婼羌开出的汽车，顺着新修的简易公路，第一次驶到了且末。婼羌和且末都在塔里木盆地的东南缘，两地相距三百五十公里，中间全是难行的沙窝。过去两县各族人民来往，全靠骆驼、毛驴和马，往返一次要一个月。去年，两县约四千民工，花了四个多月的时间修通了这条公路。

    延长川江拖双驳的时间
    最近长江航运管理局重庆分局决定进一步降低枯水季节船队拖双驳的最低水位。这一措施起码可以延长川江拖双驳的时间三个月，为国家增加运费收入一百万元以上。

    用马丁炉炼变压器硅钢
    利用马丁炉生产变压器硅钢，最近在太原钢铁厂炼钢部试验成功，试炼出来的两炉钢都达到了技术标准。
    用马丁炉冶炼变压器硅钢在我国还是第一次。过去，硅钢都是用电炉冶炼的。由于电炉小，又是用电冶炼，不但成本高、产量小，而且钢的均匀性也不容易保证。在马丁炉中冶炼就可以消灭这些缺点，使产量大大提高。

    制造有机玻璃的车间
    苏州市公私合营安利化工厂新建的制造有机玻璃的合成单体车间，22日正式投入生产。这个车间是直接用氰化钠、甲醇、丙酮和硫酸等化学原料来制造有机玻璃的，每月可以生产有机玻璃两千公斤左右。
    有机玻璃俗称不碎玻璃，是航空、汽车、电器等制造工业不可缺少的原料。人们常见的计算尺、三角尺、工厂的防护设备和手表表面等有许多都是用有机玻璃制成的。这种玻璃颜色洁白、透明、耐寒，并有高度的绝缘性。
