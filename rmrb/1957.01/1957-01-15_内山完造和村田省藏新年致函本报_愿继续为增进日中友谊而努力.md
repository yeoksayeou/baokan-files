Kanzō Uchiyama and Shōzō Murata Send New Year's Greetings to This Newspaper, Expressing Their Willingness to Continue Efforts to Enhance Sino-Japanese Friendship

    This newspaper reports that Kanzō Uchiyama, Vice President of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association, sent a New Year's letter to this newspaper on New Year's Day, extending New Year's greetings to the Chinese people and expressing his determination to continue working to consolidate world peace and strengthen friendly relations between the people of Japan and China. The original letter is as follows:

    As we welcome 1957, I, as a Japanese citizen, respectfully offer New Year's greetings to the Chinese people.

    Just as no one opposes or slanders peace, no country in the world hates or opposes peace. However, due to differing ideas, the methods adopted are also different.

    Peace is bound to come after war; and I am convinced that peace cannot be achieved through war. However, there are still people in the world who believe that peace can be achieved through war. Even if we concede that peace can be achieved through war, it is unimaginable to say that there is no other way to achieve peace except through war. Although some people have long held the idea of waging war for peace, the result has proven that it is not feasible. Therefore, we must adopt other methods, that is, the method of "negotiation" that people have been emphasizing recently. Any problem between countries can be resolved through consultation. Problems such as the Korean issue, the Vietnam issue, and the Egyptian issue were once attempted to be resolved through war, but war did not solve these problems. Later, not only the warring parties but also many other countries negotiated together and found a solution. Of course, the solution is not yet complete, but in any case, it has been proven that problems can be solved through consultation. In any case, this is a modern progress.

    Eleven years have passed since the end of the war between Japan and China, and the war between Japan and the Soviet Union. Now Japan has finally restored diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, but has not yet ended the state of war with China. However, this is only a formal issue between the two countries. In fact, peace between the two peoples has already been achieved. Last year, Chinese commodity exhibitions were held in Tokyo and Osaka. The dazzling Chinese five-star red flag once flew over Japan. At the Japanese commodity exhibitions held in Beijing and Shanghai, people were also happy to see the Japanese flag.

    I also visited the Japanese commodity exhibition in China. In that bustling crowd, people did not feel any aggression, plunder, or other dangers at all. People simply admired with admiration, asking or answering some questions to each other. Everyone was smiling. The goods sold at the exhibition sold quickly, as if they had wings, which shows that peace between Japan and China has essentially arrived. At the same time, the time to express this substance has also matured.

    As long as we are determined to do it, any difficulty can be overcome. We must use the power of our people nationwide this year to strive for the realization of the peace declaration.

                                            Kanzō Uchiyama
                                            January 1, 1957

    This newspaper reports that Shōzō Murata, President of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, sent a New Year's letter to this newspaper on New Year's Day, expressing his willingness to work hard in the new year to further expand Sino-Japanese economic exchanges and consolidate the friendly relations between the two peoples. The original letter is as follows:

    Wishing you a happy New Year.

    In recent years, especially in the past year, Sino-Japanese trade has been further expanded, which has greatly promoted the development of friendly relations between the people of Japan and China. This is really something we should all be happy about.

    You and people from all walks of life have given us great assistance in the Japanese commodity exhibitions held in Beijing and Shanghai last autumn and other various tasks. I would like to express my deep gratitude for this.

    The newly established Ishibashi Cabinet in Japan at the end of last year has a deep understanding of the significance of Sino-Japanese trade, which has further strengthened our will. This year, we will work even harder to further expand economic exchanges with your country, consolidate the friendly relations between the two peoples, and work with you to make the greatest efforts.

    At the beginning of this year, I wish you good health and success in your work, and sincerely hope that your country will achieve greater achievements in its construction.

                        Shōzō Murata, President of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association
                                                  January 1, 1957

    内山完造和村田省藏新年致函本报
    愿继续为增进日中友谊而努力
    本报讯　日中友好协会副会长内山完造在今年元旦致函本报，向中国人民祝贺新年，并表示要继续为巩固世界和平和加强日中两国人民友好关系而努力。原信如下：
    正当迎接1957年的时候，我以一个日本国民的身分，谨向中国人民敬贺新年。
    正如没有人反对或诋毁和平一样，世界上也没有任何一个国家是憎恶或反对和平的，但是由于各自的想法不同，因而所采取的方法也就不一样。
    战争之后和平必然到来；而我确信决不能用战争取得和平。但是，现在世界上还有人认为可以用战争取得和平。即便退一百步来说，和平可以用战争取得，那末如果说除了战争就没有别的方法可以取得和平的话，这是不可想像的。过去虽然有人长期以来抱着为和平而进行战争的想法，但结果证明那是行不通的。因此不能不采取别的方法，也就是说采取最近人们一直在强调的“协商”的方法。国与国之间的任何问题都可以通过协商求得解决。如朝鲜问题、越南问题、埃及问题等，曾经有人想用战争来解决，但是战争没有解决这些问题。到后来，不仅是交战的双方，而且还有其它好多国家在一起进行协商才得到了解决。当然，解决得还不彻底，但无论如何已经证明经过协商是可以解决问题的。不管怎样说，这是现代的一个进步。
    自从日本同中国、苏联的战争结束以来已经过了十一年。现在日本同苏联终于恢复了邦交，但是同中国还没有结束战争状态。然而这只是国家之间的形式上的问题，事实上两国人民之间的和平已经实现了。去年在东京、大阪两地举行了中国商品展览会。耀眼的中国五星红旗曾飘扬在日本的上空。而在北京、上海举办的日本商品展览会上，人们也高兴地看到了日本的国旗。
    我也参观过在中国的日本商品展览会。在那熙熙攘攘的人群中，人们根本不感觉有什么侵略和掠夺以及其它的危险。人们只是怀着钦佩的心情欣赏着，彼此询问或回答一些情况，所有的人都是喜笑颜开。展览会上出售的商品卖得飞快，简直像长了翅膀似的，这就说明日中两国间的和平实质上是已经到来了。同时把这种实质表现出来的时机也已经成熟了。
    只要坚决地去做，任何困难都是可以克服的。我们一定要在今年用我们全国人民的力量来争取和平宣言的实现。
                                            内山完造
                                            1957年元旦
    本报讯　日本国际贸易促进协会会长村田省藏于今年元旦致函本报，表示要在新的一年中为进一步扩大日中经济交流和巩固两国人民的友好关系而努力。原信如下：
    祝您新春快乐。
    近几年来，特别是去年一年，日中贸易有了进一步的扩大，大大地促进了日中两国人民友好关系的发展。这实在是值得我们共同引为庆幸的事情。
    对于去年秋天我们在北京、上海举办的日本商品展览会以及其它各种工作，您和有关各界的人士都给了我们极大的援助。对此谨致以深厚的谢意。
    去年年底日本新成立的石桥内阁，对日中贸易的意义有深刻的理解，这更加巩固了我们的意志。今年我们更将为进一步扩大同贵国的经济交流、巩固两国人民的友好关系和你们一起尽最大的努力。
    在这一年之始的时候，祝您健康和工作顺利，并且衷心地希望贵国的建设取得更大的成就。
                        日本国际贸易促进协会会长　村田省藏
                                                  1957年元旦
