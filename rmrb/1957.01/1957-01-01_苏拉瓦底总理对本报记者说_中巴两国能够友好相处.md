Suhrawardy Tells Our Reporter: China and Pakistan Can Live Together in Friendship

    Dacca, December 29th (By Our Reporter Hu Qi) – Today, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Suhrawardy said on the steamer “Mary Anderson” that although China and Pakistan have different political systems, there is no reason to believe that they cannot be friends because of this. When asked about Premier Zhou's visit to Pakistan and the results of the talks between the two Prime Ministers, Suhrawardy said: We can understand each other, and we have also found friendship. Our two countries can live together in friendship. Suhrawardy was accompanying Premier Zhou on a visit to an industrial area near Dacca.
    Regarding further strengthening the friendly relations between the two countries, Suhrawardy said: Like this, more visits, more people coming and going to learn from each other, and more frequent cultural exchanges are all beneficial. In response to another question – whether he sees anything hindering the friendly relations between China and Pakistan, Suhrawardy said that China and Pakistan are in different political camps, and they have different views, such as on the Hungarian issue. However, he emphasized, why can't the two countries be friends? Why can't they cooperate? What we need is friendship and cooperation. Then he added, I'm not talking about nominal friends, but real friends.

    苏拉瓦底总理对本报记者说
    中巴两国能够友好相处
    达卡12月29日讯　本报记者胡骑报道：今日巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底在“玛丽·安德逊号”汽船上说，虽然中、巴两国在政治制度上不同，但是没有理由认为它们就因此不能成为朋友。记者问及周总理访问巴基斯坦和两国总理会谈的结果时，苏拉瓦底说：我们能够互相了解，我们也找到了友谊。我们两国可以友好相处。苏拉瓦底正陪同周总理从达卡附近的工业区访问归来。
    关于进一步增强两国的友好关系，苏拉瓦底说：就这样，更多的访问，更多的人互相来往、互相学习，更频繁的文化交流，所有这些都是有益的。在回答另一个问题——在他看来有没有什么东西妨碍中、巴之间的友好关系时，苏拉瓦底说，中、巴两国处在不同的政治阵营里，它们有不同的见解。譬如在匈牙利问题上。但是，他着重说，为什么两国就不能成为朋友呢？为什么它们就不能合作呢？我们需要的是友谊和合作。接着他又补充道，我不是说名义上的朋友，而是真正的朋友。
