    A Glimpse of Alexandria
    By Our Correspondent Jiang Yuanchun
    "Gele – gele – gele…" A middle-aged man chanted these words as he walked toward us. He squatted down in front of the small round table where we were sitting, put down the canvas bag hanging on his shoulder, then took out three teacups from the bag, placed them on the table, and immediately began performing a magic trick of turning empty cups into dice. He shuffled the three empty cups around, producing one, two, three dice from inside, and finally a chick.
    "Baroka, baroka…" he continued chanting his rhyme, twisting the head of the pitiful little chick, and immediately another chick with black spots appeared. He tucked the two chicks into his arms and started playing a card-guessing trick. He embarrassed one of our friends by suddenly saying that the guessed card must be inside his suit jacket. Sure enough, he not only retrieved the card from our friend's jacket but also continuously pulled out almost an entire deck of cards. Unexpectedly, he then pulled out two chirping chicks from there and an egg from where our friend was sitting. The magician's quick hands and the effect he created caused a burst of laughter.
    This little episode happened less than half an hour after we arrived in Alexandria. Thus, we began our trip to this second largest city in Egypt.
    We arrived in Alexandria at night. After speeding along the desolate desert highway for several hours, it was indeed a pleasure to see the string of lights like bright pearls along the bay. On the right side of the road was a reed field, and the car's headlights sometimes illuminated a stretch of water and a small boat. This was Lake Mariout, south of Alexandria.
    The night scene in Alexandria was exceptionally beautiful. It had just rained, the ground was still wet, but the sky was already full of stars. There were few pedestrians on the coastal road. Beneath the half-person-high stone wall, the gentle waves of the Mediterranean lazily lapped against the embankment.
    In this city founded by Alexander the Great of Macedonia in 331 BC, people inevitably feel a sense of nostalgia. However, more than two thousand years have passed, and the city has become a modern one, with few historical sites remaining. Apart from a Greco-Roman Museum, Pompey's Pillar, and a few ancient tombs, there is not much to see. Our hosts clearly did not want us to dwell on the past but wanted us to see more of the present and future of Egypt.
    So, the next day, we visited the two palaces of the deposed King Farouk. Alexandria is known as the "Summer Capital" of Egypt. In the past, every summer, the king and his court nobles would leave the sweltering heat of Cairo and come here to enjoy the cool breeze from the Mediterranean. Farouk chose the best locations at both ends of Alexandria's 36-kilometer coastal road to build two palaces. The one in the east was called Ras el-Tin, and the one in the west was called El-Montaza. The latter was built on a small hill overlooking the sea, surrounded by a lush botanical garden, with particularly beautiful scenery.
    As for the interior furnishings of these two palaces, I find it hard to think of any other comment besides "vulgar." Farouk arranged his palaces according to the layout of top European hotels. The king, queen, and queen mother each had a suite of bedrooms, reception rooms, offices, and bathrooms. Princesses, princes, and even nannies were similarly arranged. The furniture in the rooms was all in the style of French and Italian courts, even the ceilings and wallpaper. In Ras el-Tin Palace, only two places were worth seeing. One was the room where the throne was placed. This room was entirely in Arabic style, with exquisite and magnificent Arabic patterns on the walls and ceiling. The other place worth seeing was the pier where Farouk boarded his yacht when he embarked on his life of exile. This was a place of historical significance. The white yacht that carried him away from Egypt is now moored nearby. The seawater plays at the edge of the stone steps of the pier. In the harbor, under the sunlight, many fishing boats are moored. Ships with sails are coming and going on the sparkling sea. The people, having freed themselves from the rule of a昏庸愚蠢 tyrant, are living a peaceful and industrious life.
    The most beautiful part of El-Montaza Palace is its seaside. The blue sky is boundless, and the turquoise waves of the Mediterranean roll in, bursting into countless splashes on the rocks on the shore. The garden surrounding the palace is also very nice. The dense foliage of banyan trees and mimosa trees forms many secluded and quiet paths.
    Alexandria's most proud feature is its seaside. It consists of several bays, suitable for swimming and bathing in the sea. A good road connects all the bays. Almost all the hotels and lodging houses are along the road. In the summer, they receive tens of thousands of tourists from many countries, giving Alexandria a reputation for hospitality. However, now it is winter, and due to the war, there are almost no tourists. Many hotels and lodging houses are closed, appearing very deserted.
    Alexandria is also a center for Egypt's shipping industry and import and export trade. It has a world-renowned cotton market. It is also the center of Egypt's Mediterranean fisheries. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we were unable to learn more about these aspects.
    Our hosts insisted that we take a look at the Faculty of Engineering of Alexandria University. This sentiment is perfectly understandable. Because in Egypt, few people are now unaware that Egypt must build its own industry, and cultivating Egypt's industrial construction talents has become an urgent task. The Faculty of Engineering building was recently built. Dean Hussein Shafi accompanied us on a tour of this place of which he was quite proud.
    The Faculty of Engineering of Alexandria University was founded in 1942. Initially, it had less than two hundred students, but this year the number of students has reached nearly two thousand. This shows that young people are increasingly concerned about industrial construction. The entire faculty is divided into five departments: Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, Architectural, and Chemical Engineering, with the Mechanical Engineering Department having the most students. Students study for five years, one of which is a preparatory year. There is an experimental workshop, including metalworking, fitter, woodworking, and automobile repair sections. It is said that Chinese textile machines will soon be added here for practical training. There are still very few female students, only seven in the entire faculty. Students need about 100 pounds per year, including tuition and board. Judging from the general income situation in Egypt (the income of general journalists and clerks is about 25 to 40 pounds per month), most of the students are from middle-class families.
    The Faculty of Engineering has 130 professors, associate professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants. Teachers above the rank of lecturer have all obtained degrees abroad. The textbooks currently used are foreign textbooks, and lectures are given in English. This situation does not seem likely to continue for long, because the dean told us that the teachers are working hard to translate the textbooks into Arabic so that it will be possible to teach in Arabic in the future.
    In the evening, we attended a tea party hosted by the Alexandria City Journalists Association. In addition to the reporters from the city's two newspapers, there were also reporters from Cairo's newspapers stationed here, as well as the president of Alexandria University and the deans of its several colleges, and the director of the city's police bureau. People sincerely expressed their friendly feelings towards the Chinese people and were very interested in learning about the situation in China in all aspects. We deeply felt how urgent and necessary it is to strengthen cultural exchanges and contacts between China and Egypt.
    However, this exchange has already begun. The Chinese film "Chicken Feather Letter" has also been released in Alexandria. We went to see a show. The audience nodded and smiled at us. When the film was screened to the climax scene of the people's victory, the audience applauded, and some even shouted slogans. After the film ended, the audience turned around and applauded us. At the door, a reporter who had just finished watching the film said to us: "Excellent!" Several other audience members waited next to the car, watching us and applauding. Through this film, they probably better understood why the Chinese people so resolutely stood on the side of the Egyptian people who were fighting against imperialist aggression. (Attached picture)

    亚历山大港一瞥
    本报记者　蒋元椿
    “格勒—格勒—格勒……”一位中年男子一边嘴里这样念念有词，一边向我们坐着的地方走来。他在我们围坐着的一张小圆桌前蹲下来，放下他肩上挂着的一个帆布袋，接着从袋里拿出三只茶杯，一一摆在桌上，马上玩起空杯变骰子的魔术来了。他把三只空杯套来套去，从里面变出了一粒、两粒、三粒骰子，最后变出了一只小鸡。
    “巴若卡，巴若卡，……”他继续唱着顺口溜，把那只可怜相的小鸡的头一扭，立刻出现了另一只带黑花的小鸡。他把两只小鸡往怀里一揣，又玩起认纸牌的花样。他把我们的一位朋友弄得很窘，因为他忽然说那张被认过的纸牌一定在他的西装上衣里面。果然，他从那位朋友的上衣里面不仅取出了那张纸牌，而且源源不竭地取出了几乎整整一付纸牌。接着出人意外，他又从那里面取出了两只唧唧叫着的小鸡，并且从那位朋友坐的地方取出了一个鸡蛋。这位魔术家的快捷的手法和他所造成的效果，引起了哄然大笑。
    这个小插曲发生在我们到达亚历山大港不到半小时之内。我们就这样开始了在这个埃及第二大城市的旅行。
    我们是在夜间到达亚历山大港的，在黑漆漆的荒凉的沙漠上沿着沙漠公路疾驰了几小时之后，望见沿着港湾的那一串像明珠般的灯火，的确是一件快事。在公路右边，是一片芦苇地，汽车的头灯有时还照出一片水面和一只小船。这是亚历山大港南面的马留特湖。
    亚历山大港的夜色异常幽美。刚刚下过一阵小雨，地上还是润湿的，天上却已经满天星斗。沿海的马路上行人很少。在半人高的石头围墙下面，地中海的轻缓的波涛懒懒地击拍着堤岸。
    在这个由马其顿的亚历山大大帝在纪元前三百三十一年建立的城市里，人们免不了油然地产生怀古之情。不过，两千多年的时间过去了，这个城市变成了一座现代化的城市，古迹在这里已经所余无几。除了一所希腊罗马博物馆、一支旁贝圆柱和几处古墓以外，没有什么可看的了。而我们的主人显然并不希望我们去缅怀往昔，而要我们多看一看现在和将来的埃及。
    于是，第二天，我们去参观了已被驱逐的国王法鲁克的两所行宫。亚历山大港被称为埃及的“夏都”。在从前，一到夏天，国王和他的宫廷贵族就都避开酷热的开罗，到这里来享受地中海上的凉风。法鲁克在亚历山大港的长达三十六公里的沿海马路的两头选择最好的地点，建立了两所皇宫。东边的一所叫做拉萨尔丁，西边的一所叫做厄尔·蒙塔查。后者建立在临海的一座小山岗上，环绕以一个繁茂的植物园，风景特别幽美。
    对于这两所皇宫的内部陈设，除了“俗不可耐”四个字以外，我很难想出别的评语。法鲁克是按照欧洲的头等旅馆的格局来安排他的皇宫的。国王、王后、母后，每个人都安排了一套卧房，接待室、办公室、浴室，公主、太子，以至于保姆，等而下之，也都安排了这么一套。房间里的家具全是法国、意大利宫廷式的，甚至天花板和糊壁纸也是如此。在拉萨尔丁皇宫里，值得一看的只有两个地方。一个地方是放王座的房间。这个房间从上到下都是阿拉伯式，墙上和天花板上全是精妙绝伦、瑰丽无比的阿拉伯图案。另一个可看的地方，就是法鲁克走上他的放逐生涯时登上他的游船的码头。这是一个有历史意义的地方。载送他离开埃及的那条白色的游船，现在就碇泊在附近。海水在码头的石级边嬉戏。港湾里阳光下面，碇泊着许多渔船。挂着帆的船只，在波光粼粼的海面上来来往往。人民在摆脱了昏庸愚蠢的暴君的统治之后，正在过着和平劳动的生活。
    厄尔·蒙塔查皇宫最美的地方是它的海边。蓝天无际，地中海碧绿的波涛，迎面滚滚而来，在岸边的岩石上迸裂成无数浪花。环绕这个皇宫的花园，也很不错。榕树、合欢树的茂密的枝叶，构成了许多条不见天日的幽静的甬道。
    亚历山大港最值得骄傲的地方是它的海边。它由几个海湾构成，适宜于游泳和海水浴。一条很好的马路连接着所有的海湾。马路边上几乎全是旅馆和寄宿舍。一到夏天，它们就接待成千上万的从许多国家来的游客，使亚历山大港有好客之称。不过，现在正是冬季，加上战争的关系，游客几乎没有。许多旅馆和寄宿舍都是门扉紧闭，显得很冷落的样子。
    亚历山大港也是埃及航运业和进出口贸易的一个中心。在这里有着世界著名的棉花市场。这里也是埃及在地中海的渔业的中心。可惜，由于时间的关系，我们没有能够就这些方面作更多的了解。
    主人们坚持要我们看一看亚历山大大学的工学院。这种情意是完全可以理解的。因为在埃及，现在很少人不知道必须建设埃及自己的工业，而培养埃及的工业建设人才，就成为当务之急。工学院的房子是新建不久的。院长侯赛因·夏菲博士陪着我们参观了他这个颇为自豪的地方。
    亚历山大大学工学院创始于1942年，最初只有不到二百个学生，然而今年的学生达到了将近两千人。这说明青年们正在越来越多地关心工业建设。全院分机械、电机、土木、建筑、化工等五个系，以学机械系的为最多。学生学习五年，其中一年为预科，有一个实验工场，包括金工、钳工、木工和汽车修理等部分。据说，不久这里将增加中国的纺织机器，作为实习之用。女生还是很少，全院现在只有七名。学生每年需要费用大约一百镑，包括学费和膳宿费在内。从埃及一般家庭收入情况来看（一般记者和职员的收入是每月二十五到四十镑左右），学生大部分是中产阶级的子弟。
    工学院有一百三十名教授、副教授、讲师和助教。讲师以上的教员都是在外国得过学位的。现在用的教本是外国的教本，讲课用英语。这种情况看来不会再继续很久，因为院长先生告诉我们说，教员们正在努力把课本翻译成阿拉伯文，这样，将来就有可能用阿拉伯语进行讲授。
    晚上，我们出席了亚历山大市记者协会招待我们的一个茶会。出席茶会的除了本市两家报纸的记者以外，还有开罗各报驻在这里的记者，以及亚历山大大学的校长和它的几个学院的院长，以及本市警察局的局长。人们极为诚恳地表示他们对中国人民的友好感情，并且极有兴趣地希望了解中国各方面的情形。我们深深感觉到，加强中埃两国之间的文化交流和接触是何等的迫切和需要。
    不过，这种交流已经有了开始。中国电影“鸡毛信”也已经在亚历山大港上映。我们去看了一场。观众们向我们点头微笑。在电影放映到人民取得胜利的高潮场面的时候，观众们鼓掌，有人还高呼口号。电影放映完毕，观众们回过身来，向我们鼓掌致意。在门口，一位刚看完电影的记者向我们说：“好极了！”还有几位观众等在汽车旁边看着我们，向我们鼓掌。他们通过这个电影，大概更加了解了中国人民为什么这样坚决地站在为反抗帝国主义侵略而斗争的埃及人民这一边了。（附图片）
