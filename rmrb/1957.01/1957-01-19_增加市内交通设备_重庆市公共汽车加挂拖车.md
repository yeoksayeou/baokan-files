    Increasing Urban Transportation Capacity
    Chongqing Buses Add Trailers
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 17th: Starting on New Year's Day, trolleybuses and buses in Chongqing have been adding trailers in batches on main traffic lines. The safe operation over the past half-month proves that passenger vehicles can indeed be equipped with trailers just like trucks.
    The Chongqing Public Transportation Company manufactured fifteen of these passenger trailers last year. Because they were made using chassis and axles from scrapped vehicles and do not require engines, the cost of each trailer is only one-third to one-quarter of that of a bus, but the passenger capacity can reach three-quarters of that of a bus.
    These passenger trailers are relatively flexible and lightweight, and do not affect the speed of trolleybuses and buses after being attached. The chassis is very close to the ground, making it convenient for passengers to get on and off. The drawbar of the trailer is welded from channel steel, making it very strong and providing a safety factor of ten to prevent impact. If the trailer becomes detached, there is also an automatic braking system to ensure safety.
    Currently, the Chongqing Public Transportation Company is converting all of its long-abandoned old Jieshi (GMC) and old Dodge trucks into trailers for transportation. It has also purchased some scrapped vehicles from Guiyang, with two currently being converted. Once all trailers are put into operation, it will be equivalent to adding more than ten unmanned new vehicles to the city.
    These passenger trailers are designed and manufactured by the Chongqing Public Transportation Company. Transportation departments from cities such as Chengdu, Shenyang, and Anshan have sent people to Chongqing to learn the technology of manufacturing passenger trailers.

    增加市内交通设备
    重庆市公共汽车加挂拖车
    新华社重庆17日电　重庆市的无轨电车和公共汽车今年元旦开始在交通干线上成批加挂拖车。半个月来安全行驶的情况证明，客车完全可以和货车一样加挂拖车。
    重庆市公共交通公司去年做了十五部这种客车拖车。因为利用废车的车盘和车轴制造，又不要发动机，每部拖车的成本只及一部汽车的三分之一到四分之一，但是载客的容量可以达到公共汽车的四分之三。
    这种客车拖车比较灵活轻便，无轨电车和公共汽车拖上以后并不影响行驶速度。车底离地很近，乘客上下也很方便。拖车的拉杆用槽钢焊接而成，十分坚固，有十倍的安全系数以防冲击。如果拖车脱钩，还有自动刹车设备可以确保安全。
    现在，重庆市公共交通公司把全部废弃多年的老吉士牌汽车和老道奇车改装成拖车参加运输，还从贵阳收购了一部分废车，有两部正在改装。全部拖车投入生产以后，等于给全市增加了十多部无人驾驶的新车。
    这种客车拖车是由重庆市公共交通公司设计制造的。成都、沈阳、鞍山等城市的交通运输部门都派人来重庆学习制造客车拖车的技术。
