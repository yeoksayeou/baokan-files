    To Further Meet the People's Living Needs
    The Soviet Union Vigorously Develops the Production of Daily Necessities
    The Ministry of Light Industry Exceeded its Production Plan Last Year by 3.5 Billion Rubles
    (Dispatch from our correspondent Li He, Moscow, January 6th) I am impressed by the fact that the Soviet Union is striving to increase the production of daily necessities in order to further meet the needs of people's lives, as stated by Nikolai Maksimovich Ivanov, Deputy Minister of the Soviet Ministry of Light Industry, in an interview with me on the 5th. The Soviet Ministry of Light Industry was recently formed by the merger of the Ministry of Light Industry and the Ministry of Textile Industry, because in the various Union republics, the light industry and textile industry are managed by one ministry. Also participating in the interview were Fedorovich, Director of the Statistics Bureau of the Soviet Ministry of Light Industry, and Tretyakov, Director of the Technical Bureau, among others.
    Regarding the situation of production development, Ivanov said: All enterprises of the Soviet Ministry of Light Industry exceeded the planned production by 3.5 billion rubles in 1956, including 2 million meters of wool fabrics, 5.4 million pairs of leather shoes, and 3.3 million meters of rayon fabrics. Taking rayon fabrics as an example, in 1940 there were only two factories with an annual output of only 10,000 tons; now there are many factories with a total annual output of 100,000 tons, and by 1960, the annual output will be 330,000 tons. The raw material situation is very good this year. The cotton-producing Central Asian republics have had a bumper cotton harvest. The national cotton purchase plan has been completed ahead of schedule. The cotton is not only enough for the Soviet textile industry, but will also supply several people's democratic countries. Fedorovich added: The Soviet Union now produces 5.904 billion meters of cotton cloth annually, which means that each person can get an average of 29 meters of cotton cloth, but we believe that each person needs 46 meters of cotton cloth, which is what we are striving for. By 1958, the Soviet Union will produce 770 million meters of silk fabrics annually, and we do not think this will be enough to satisfy the needs.
    Regarding the direction of production development, Ivanov pointed out that although the Soviet Ministry of Light Industry is building many new factories, the most important thing is to expand existing factories and renovate the technical equipment of existing factories. He said: The first part of the Kameshin Textile Mill, with 120,000 spindles, has already been put into production; when the entire project is completed, it will have 485,000 spindles and produce 1 million meters of cloth per day. Large cotton mills are being built in Barnaul and Kherson. Large wool mills are being built in Minsk and Krasnodar. Synthetic fiber plants are being built in Kiev and other places. However, expanding and renovating existing factories can save manpower and materials and achieve results more quickly. In addition to the fact that all new textile mills will adopt automated machines, existing factories are also gradually replacing automated looms, with an annual investment of 1 billion rubles for this purpose. A female worker can supervise 32 automated looms. The 17 scientific research institutes directly under the Soviet Ministry of Light Industry are studying the issues raised by the Ministry of Light Industry, primarily the manufacturing of new-style machines. Automated looms that shuttle 240 times per minute (the old ones shuttle 200 times) have been successfully tested and are starting to be produced. We plan to purchase foreign machines and send experts to Italy and other countries to study the textile industry. We are striving to improve varieties, make products more diverse, more beautiful, and better, and pay special attention to improving the production of children's fabrics. Tretyakov added: During the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, 128,000 automated looms will be added. Regarding savings, Ivanov talked about the following points: First, Soviet light industry enterprises pay the most attention to saving raw materials, because raw materials constitute 70% of the cost of light industrial products. For example, the Tiraspol Sewing Factory has created a method of making full use of fabrics in cutting, reducing the amount of waste fabric by two-thirds. Second, maintaining equipment well so that machines do not need to be repaired for a long time. The Ministry of Light Industry spends 1 billion rubles annually on repairing equipment. Third, streamlining administrative organizations and personnel. The Ministry of Light Industry has simplified its organization, merged small workshops in factories, and reduced the number of reports by half. Some factories have even reduced the number of inspectors, strengthening workers' sense of responsibility for product quality. The staff of enterprises in the Soviet light industry, including the textile industry, accounted for 4.9% of the total workforce in 1953, but only 4% in 1956. The ministry's organization is also constantly being streamlined. After the daily necessities sector was divided into several ministries, the Ministry of Light Industry and Textile Industry had 4,000 staff members in 1954, which was later reduced to 3,200, then to 2,200 in 1955, and then to 1,500 in 1956, and will be reduced to 870 in 1957. In the various Union republics, the industrial ministries used to be connected to their bureaus and affiliated enterprises, but now the ministries are directly connected to the enterprises, which has also reduced a lot of personnel and simplified administrative work.

### 进一步满足人民的生活需要  苏联大力发展日用品生产  轻工业部在去年超计划增产价值三十五亿卢布的产品

    进一步满足人民的生活需要
    苏联大力发展日用品生产
    轻工业部在去年超计划增产价值三十五亿卢布的产品
    本报莫斯科6日电　记者李何报道：苏联正在努力提高日用必需品的生产，以便进一步满足人民生活的需要，——这是苏联轻工业部副部长尼古拉·马克辛莫维奇·伊凡诺夫5日向我发表的谈话留给我的印象。苏联轻工业部是在不久以前由轻工业部和纺织工业部合并成立的，因为在各加盟共和国轻工业与纺织工业是由一个部管理的。参加谈话的还有苏联轻工业部的统计局长费多罗维奇和技术局长特列季雅科夫等。
    关于生产发展的情形，伊凡诺夫说：苏联轻工业部所有企业在1956年超计划增产了三十五亿卢布产品，包括二百万公尺毛织品、五百四十万双皮鞋和三百三十万公尺人造丝织品。以人造丝织品来说，在1940年只有两个工厂，年产只一万吨；如今有许多工厂，年产共十万吨，到1960年将年产三十三万吨。今年原料的情况很好。产棉区中亚细亚各共和国的棉花丰收。国家购棉计划提前完成。棉花不但够苏联纺织工业用，而且将供应几个人民民主国家。费多罗维奇补充说：苏联现在年产五十九亿零四百万公尺棉布，即每人平均可得二十九公尺棉布，而我们认为每个人需要四十六公尺棉布，这是我们在努力争取的。苏联到1958年将年产七亿七千万公尺丝织品，我们不认为这就满足了。
    关于生产发展的方向，伊凡诺夫指出，虽然苏联轻工业部正在建设许多新的工厂，最主要的还是扩大现有工厂和革新现有工厂的技术设备。他说：卡梅辛大纺织厂的第一部分十二万纱锭已经投入生产；全部工程完成时将有四十八万五千纱锭，一昼夜将产一百万公尺布，在巴纳乌尔和赫尔逊建设着大棉织厂。在明斯克和克拉斯诺达尔建设着大毛织厂。在基辅等地建设着合成纤维厂。但是扩建和改建现有工厂能更节约人力物力和更快收到效果。除新建的纺织厂将一律采取自动化机器以外，现有工厂也在逐步换装自动化织布机，每年为此投资十亿卢布。一个女工可以看管三十二台自动化织布机。直属苏联轻工业部的十七个科学研究所研究着轻工业部提出的问题，首先是制造新式机器。试验成功和开始生产一分钟穿梭二百四十下的自动化织布机（旧的穿梭二百下）。我们计划购进外国机器，并且派专家到意大利和别的国家去考察纺织工业。我们努力改进品种，使产品更多样、更美观，更好，特别注意改进儿童布料的生产。特列季雅科夫补充说：在第六个五年计划时期内将补充十二万八千台自动化织布机。关于节约，伊凡诺夫谈了如下几点：第一，苏联轻工业企业最注意节约原料，因为原料构成轻工业品成本的70％。例如，季拉斯波尔缝纫厂在裁布方面创造了尽量利用布料的方法，把作废的布头减少三分之二。第二，很好保养设备，使机器很长时期不用修理。轻工业部每年用十亿卢布修理设备。第三，精简行政机构和人员。轻工业部简化机构，合并工厂的小车间，把表报缩减一半。若干工厂连验货员也削减了，加强工人对产品质量的责任感。苏联轻工业包括纺织工业的企业的职员，在1953年占职工人员的4.9％，在1956年只占4％。部的机构也不断精简。日用必需品部分为几个部后，1954年轻工业和纺织工业部有四千工作人员，后来减到三千二百，1955年再减到二千二百，1956年又减到一千五百，1957年将减到八百七十。在各加盟共和国，从前工业部是经过自己的局和所属企业联系的，现在部和企业直接联系，这样也减少了许多人员，简化了行政工作。
