Xinhua News Agency, London, 7th: U.S. President Eisenhower's Middle East policy address on the 5th has been treated with considerable caution in Britain. Although unofficial statements from officials have expressed satisfaction with the U.S. policy, a British Foreign Office spokesman stated that Britain would not issue an official comment on the issue until the U.S. Congress had expressed its views on the address.

On the other hand, a certain sense of panic can be seen in the comments of the bourgeois newspapers, which fear that the U.S. President's plan will squeeze Britain out of the oil-rich Middle East.

	The "Sunday Express" published an article written by Stanley Evans criticizing Eisenhower's plan. He complained that the U.S. only cares about its own interests and does not consider the interests of its allies. He said: "Cooperation ceases to be cooperation when it no longer supports the strength and prestige of the partners." Evans said that Britain's vested interests have been "undermined by the almighty dollar."

	The "Reynold News" asked: Is the goal of Eisenhower's policy "simply to replace one discredited form of great power control (over the Middle East region) with another?"

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 7th: While welcoming Eisenhower's address, French right-wing newspapers also expressed general reservations about "Eisenhowerism." "L'Aurore" pointed out in an editorial that the United States hopes to fill the so-called "vacuum" caused by the loss of influence of Britain and France in the Middle East.

	The socialist "Le Populaire" said that the new U.S. policy should make the U.S. "clearly stand on the side of Britain and France in the so-called 'defense' of the Middle East, thereby proving that Atlantic solidarity is not purely symbolic." At the same time, the newspaper also believes that "Eisenhowerism" has not put forward a clear solution to the unresolved problems in the Middle East. The newspaper also acknowledged that "Eisenhowerism" has aroused strong dissatisfaction in Middle Eastern countries.

    英法报纸对“艾森豪威尔主义”表示惊慌
    抱怨美国在挖同盟者的墙脚
    据新华社7日讯　伦敦消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔5日发表的中东政策咨文在英国受到相当谨慎的对待。虽然官方的非正式声明对美国政策表示满意，但是英国外交部发言人表示，在美国国会就这个咨文表明它的看法以前，英国不会对这个问题发表正式的评论。
    另一方面，从资产阶级报纸的评论中可以看出某种惊慌情绪，它们担心美国总统的计划会把英国从富产石油的中东地区排挤出去。
      “星期日快报”发表的斯坦莱·伊凡斯写的一篇文章批评了艾森豪威尔的计划。他抱怨美国只是关心自己的利益，而不把自己的同盟者的利益放在眼里。他说：“当合作不再支持伙伴的力量和威信时，合作就不成其为合作了。伊凡斯说：英国的切身利益已经“被万能的美元破坏了”。
      “雷诺新闻”问道：艾森豪威尔政策的目标是不是“干脆就是想用另一种大国控制（中东地区）的形式来代替原来的一种已经威信扫地的大国控制的形式？”
    据新华社7日讯　巴黎消息：法国右翼报纸在对艾森豪威尔咨文表示欢迎的同时，也对“艾森豪威尔主义”表示了一般的保留。“震旦报”在社论里指出，美国希望填补由于英、法在中东丧失影响而造成的所谓“真空”。
    社会党的“人民报”说，美国的新政策应该使美国在所谓“保卫”中东地区中“明确地同英、法站在一边，从而证明大西洋的团结不是单纯的”。同时，这家报纸也认为，“艾森豪威尔主义”没有为中东悬而未决的问题提出明确的解决方案。这家报纸还承认“艾森豪威尔主义”引起了中东国家的强烈不满。
