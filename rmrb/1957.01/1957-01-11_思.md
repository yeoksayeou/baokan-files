    Thoughts
    Liu Qisheng
    The noted figure Zhuge Liang of the late Han Dynasty had the alias Zhongsi. Once, at a court assembly in Eastern Wu, Sun Hao asked him: “Since your name is Zhongsi (meaning ‘good at thinking’), how do you think in order to achieve your desires?” Liang answered very straightforwardly: “I think of filial piety towards my parents, loyalty to my career, and trustworthiness to my friends; that’s how.”
    Today, loyalty means wholeheartedly serving the revolutionary cause. Filial piety refers to treating parents with affection and respect, in accordance with human feelings and reason. Trustworthiness means being sincere towards comrades; for example, treating everyone equally without discrimination, neither deceiving nor being deceived, neither being arrogant nor jealous, not talking about personal favors nor bearing grudges, having both criticism and unity with help, and being able to respect each other's views and honor even when there are differences.
    Thus, for comrades with personal shortcomings, drawing lessons from Zhuge Liang's thoughts is not without benefit.

    思

    汉末时的名人诸葛靓，别名叫仲思。有一次，在东吴的朝庭大会上，孙皓问他：“既然，你叫仲思（善想的意思），那么，为达到欲望，你是怎样想的呢”。靓很干脆的回答：“对父母思孝、对事业思忠、对朋友思信，就是这样。”
    如今，忠，就是对革命事业的全心全意。孝，是指尽人情、合事理的敬爱与尊待父母。信，即对待同志要诚恳；如，不分人等一视同仁，既不欺人也不受欺，既不自豪也不忌妒，不讲私恩也不记私怨，有批评又有团结与帮助、有分岐又能尊重对方见解和荣誉等。
    如此。有个人缺陷的同志，借鉴诸葛靓的思则，并非无益。
