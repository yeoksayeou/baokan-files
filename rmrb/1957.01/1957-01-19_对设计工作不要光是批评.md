    Many engineering and technical personnel in the design bureaus under our bureau believe that there are too few reports on design work in the People's Daily and local newspapers. When there are reports, they are often criticisms and reproaches, which make some designers feel that "there is more demerit than merit." However, over the past few years, design personnel have gone from complete ignorance to learning how to design, and have achieved a lot under difficult conditions. These labor achievements should be valued by the newspapers. More importantly, the growth of new forces requires more active encouragement and support, and criticism of shortcomings and mistakes is also to help them grow. If we are too negligent, or only criticize, it will dampen people's socialist enthusiasm for labor. (Design Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building)

    对设计工作不要光是批评
    我局所属各设计分局很多工程技术人员，认为人民日报和地方报纸上关于设计工作的报道太少，偶尔有，也往往是批评和责备，使有些设计人员产生了“有过无功”的错觉。但是，几年来设计人员从完全不懂到学会设计，在困难条件下做出不少成绩。这些劳动成果，应该受到报纸的重视。更重要的意义还在于新生力量的成长，需要更积极的鼓励和支持，对于缺点和错误的批评，也是为了帮助他们成长。如果过于疏忽，或者只有批评，都会挫伤人们的社会主义的劳动积极性。（第一机械工业部设计总局）
