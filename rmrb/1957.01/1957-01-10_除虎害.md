Eliminating the Tiger Menace

	Father and Sons are Both Tiger-Fighting Heroes

	In Leiyang County, Hunan Province, there is a sixty-nine-year-old tiger-fighting hero named Chen Qifang, who has over forty years of experience in tiger hunting. He led his three sons and hunting team members, traversing the mountains of Leiyang, Yongxing, Anren, and other counties, killing six tigers, twelve wild boars, and many other wild animals in just over a month. Recently, they discovered a white tiger and a large tiger weighing about five or six hundred catties in Anren and are currently tracking and pursuing them.

	Live Tiger Trapped in a Cage

	On December 14, 1956, the Xiada Sha Production Team of the Hongshui First Agricultural Cooperative in Guzhang County, Hunan Province, captured a live tiger weighing about two hundred catties using a cage trap. In recent days, the Xiada Sha Village, surrounded by mountains, has been very lively, with many people coming to see the live tiger.

	The tiger trap was made of large pine wood two feet thick and placed in the deep mountains in July 1956. Every night, resourceful hunters used a lamb as bait in the cage to lure the tiger. After waiting for nearly half a year, a tiger finally walked into the trap. The agricultural cooperative plans to sell the tiger to a state-owned commercial institution. (Xiang)

	Besieging a Fierce Tiger

	In early December, a tiger frequently appeared near Xinlong Township, Mashan District, Heng County, Guangxi. This exceptionally fierce tiger often harmed livestock in nearby villages. On December 13 of last year, it ate a fat pig weighing over ninety catties belonging to Chen Xiyu, a member of the Xinlong Township Agricultural Cooperative. The masses in nearby villages both feared and hated this fierce tiger. On December 15, staff members of the Mashan District Office organized a temporary tiger-fighting team of seventy-six farmers skilled in hunting from Mashan, Xinlong, and other townships. The team members, armed with iron forks and rifles, surrounded the mountain and searched it. After several hours, they finally discovered the tiger hiding in the thatch. The team members fired three or four shots in a row with their rifles, but the tiger still pounced towards the crowd. The team members remained calm, and several people immediately pinned the tiger down with iron forks. The tiger roared one last time with all its might, and the mountains echoed. But the team members were not intimidated; dozens of iron forks landed on its body, steadily killing it.

	This was a male tiger, weighing 301 catties, with a body length of five feet three inches and a height of three feet. Such a large tiger is rarely seen in this area. The farmers sold it and received 300 yuan.

    除虎害
    父子都是打虎英雄
    湖南省耒阳县有一位六十九岁的打虎英雄，名叫陈耆芳，已有四十多年的打虎经验。他曾带领他的三个儿子和打猎队员，奔走在耒阳、永兴、安仁等县的崇山峻岭间，在一个多月里打死了六只虎、十二只野猪和很多别的野兽。最近，他们在安仁又发现了一只白虎和一只约有五、六百斤重的大虎，正在跟踪追击。

    牢笼关活虎
    1956年12月14日，湖南省古丈县夯水第一农业社下达砂生产队用关笼活关住了一只重约二百斤的老虎。这些天来，群山环抱着的下达砂村非常热闹，许多人都去看活老虎。
    捉虎的关笼是用两尺粗的大松木制成的，1956年7月就放在深山里了。每天晚上，机智的猎人就用一只小羊，放在笼中诱虎。等待了将近半年，终于有一只老虎自投罗网了。这个农业社准备把这只老虎卖给国营商业机构。　（湘）
    围攻猛虎
    12月初旬，一只老虎不时出没在广西横县马山区新龙乡附近，这只凶猛异常的老虎，经常到附近的村庄去为害家畜。去年12月13日，它就曾吃掉了新龙乡农业社社员陈锡瑜的一头重九十多斤的肥猪。提起这只猛虎，附近村庄的群众又怕它又恨它。12月15日马山区公所的工作人员们把马山、新龙等乡善猎的农民七十六人组成一个临时打虎队。队员们拿着铁叉和步枪把山包围起来搜查。过了几个钟头，终于发现这只猛虎潜藏在茅草里。队员们用步枪一连打了三、四发，可是猛虎还是向人群扑了过来。队员们很镇定，几个人立刻用铁叉把虎叉住了。虎尽着最后一口气力大吼一声，群山响应。但是队员们没有被它吓住；几十把铁叉落在它身上，稳稳地把它打死了。
    这是一只雄虎，体重三百零一斤，身长五尺三寸，体高三尺。这样大的老虎，在这一带很少见。农民们把它卖出后，得了三百元钱。
