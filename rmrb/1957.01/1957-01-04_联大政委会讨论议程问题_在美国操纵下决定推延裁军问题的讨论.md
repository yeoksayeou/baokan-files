Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd, New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee held a meeting on January 2nd to discuss the order of discussion for the five items on the agenda. These five items are: (1) the Korean question; (2) the disarmament question; (3) the Cyprus question; (4) the Algerian question; and (5) the West Irian question.

The chairman of the Asian-African group for January, Japanese representative Kase Shunichi, said in his speech that the Asian-African group hoped that the Political Committee would discuss the disarmament issue, the Korean issue, and the Algerian issue in that order.

Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov said that disarmament should be one of the primary issues to be discussed, while the Korean issue could be left for last.

Indian representative Menon said that he believed the disarmament issue was the most important issue before the General Assembly, and the Algerian issue should also be given priority, while the Korean issue could be discussed later.

Colombian representative Bernal suggested discussing the Korean issue and the disarmament issue in that order, and then deciding the order of discussion for the other three issues later.

U.S. representative Lodge supported Colombia's proposal. He advocated postponing the discussion of the disarmament issue until after the Korean issue had been studied.

Greek representative Cassimatis suggested proceeding with the discussion in the following order: disarmament issue, Algerian issue, Cyprus issue, Korean issue, and West Irian issue. This proposal was supported by representatives from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Syria, and other countries. However, the results of the vote showed that the committee rejected the Greek proposal with twenty-nine votes in favor, twenty-nine votes against, and fourteen abstentions (proposals on procedural issues put forward in the committee need more than half of the votes to be passed).

After lengthy discussions, the committee finally adopted the joint proposal of Colombia and Lebanon, which required that the Korean issue be discussed first, and that the order of the other issues be arranged as follows: disarmament issue, Algerian issue, Cyprus issue, West Irian issue.

The next meeting of the committee is scheduled to be held on January 3.

    联大政委会讨论议程问题
    在美国操纵下决定推延裁军问题的讨论
    新华社3日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会2日举行会议，讨论列在议程上的五个项目的讨论次序问题。这五个项目是：（一）朝鲜问题；（二）裁军问题；（三）塞浦路斯问题；（四）阿尔及利亚问题；（五）西伊里安问题。
    亚非集团1月份的主席、日本代表加濑俊一在发言中说，亚非集团希望政治委员会依次讨论裁军问题、朝鲜问题、阿尔及利亚问题。
    苏联外交部副部长库兹涅佐夫说，裁军应该是要讨论的首要问题之一，而朝鲜问题可以留在最后讨论。
     印度代表梅农说，他认为裁军问题是大会最重要的问题，阿尔及利亚问题也应该优先考虑，而朝鲜问题可以在以后讨论。
    哥伦比亚代表贝纳尔建议依次讨论朝鲜问题和裁军问题，而在以后决定讨论其他三项问题的次序。
    美国代表洛奇支持哥伦比亚的建议。他主张把裁军问题的讨论推延，直到朝鲜问题研究完毕再进行。
    希腊代表卡西马蒂斯建议按下列次序进行讨论：裁军问题、阿尔及利亚问题、塞浦路斯问题、朝鲜问题、西伊里安问题。这个建议得到苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和叙利亚等国代表的支持。但是，表决结果，委员会以二十九票赞成、二十九票反对、十四票弃权否决了希腊的建议（在委员会上提出的关于程序问题的建议需要过半数才获得通过）。
    在经过冗长的讨论以后，委员会最后通过了哥伦比亚和黎巴嫩的联合提案，这个提案要求首先讨论朝鲜问题，而把其他的问题的次序排列如下：裁军问题、阿尔及利亚问题、塞浦路斯问题、西伊里安问题。
    委员会下次会议订于1月3日举行。
