Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 13th - Cairo newspapers reported on the 12th that the Liaison Committee of the Arab People's Congress has invited Arab governments to consult in order to study the Eisenhower Plan based on the aims of the Arab countries.

In a statement on the "Eisenhower Doctrine," the committee criticized American policy, believing that American policy is the same as that adopted by die-hard imperialists in trying to solve problems in the Middle East.

The statement emphasized that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" actually ignores the existence of Arab countries because it only views these countries from the perspective of its own strategic interests. Eisenhower's Middle East policy message is the greatest injustice to the people of the Middle East.

The statement said that the United States' emphasis on the "communist threat" in the Middle East is only to cover up its well-known purpose of seizing the region's natural wealth.

Referring to the economic assistance provided by the United States to Middle Eastern countries, the statement pointed out that the governments of Arab countries have long stated that they will never accept aid with conditions attached. The statement said that the American plan "is a serious threat to the stability of the Middle East situation."

The statement also affirmed the Arab countries' confidence in the policy of active neutrality and stated that the Arab countries will adhere to this policy even in the most difficult circumstances.

Xinhua News Agency, January 13th - Jordanian public resolutely protested against the United States' coercion of Arab countries to accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and fiercely condemned the US plan to enslave Middle Eastern countries.

A telegram signed by more than 6,000 Amman residents to the US Embassy in Jordan stated that the Arabs protested against the attempt by the US ruling group to force Arab countries to accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine" under the pretext of filling the non-existent "vacuum" in the Middle East. The telegram said that the purpose of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is to "replace the bankrupt rule with the establishment of 'American imperialist rule in this region.'"

Abd al-Rahman Shukair, leader of the Jordanian National Front, said that Jordan is now and will be in the future fighting with Arab countries against American interference in Middle Eastern affairs. Shukair, on behalf of the Jordanian people, expressed gratitude to the Soviet Union for supporting the struggle of the Arab people against imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 13th - A commentary broadcast by Cairo Radio on January 11th said that the recent events in Yemen "put the Eisenhower Plan to the test." It said that the plan talks a lot about saving peace in the Middle East, but the British aggression against an independent country like Yemen has not aroused any reaction from the United States, which is extremely regrettable.

The radio station said, "Reality proves that aggression against the independence of the people of the Middle East still comes from imperialists and countries supported by imperialists."

Xinhua News Agency, January 13th - Cairo News: According to the Middle East News Agency, Ismail al-Azhari, chairman of the Sudanese National Union Party and former Prime Minister, said that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is an act of interfering in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries.

    阿拉伯公众纷纷抨击美国奴役中东的计划
    开罗电台说也门事件是对“艾森豪威尔主义”的考验
    新华社开罗13日电　开罗报纸12日报道，阿拉伯人民大会联络委员会已经邀请阿拉伯各国政府进行磋商，以便根据阿拉伯国家的目的研究艾森豪威尔计划。
    这个委员会在一篇关于“艾森豪威尔主义”的声明中抨击了美国的政策，认为美国的政策同死硬的帝国主义者在设法解决中东地区问题时所采取的政策一样。
    声明强调说，“艾森豪威尔主义”实际上是无视阿拉伯国家的存在，因为它只从自己的战略利益的观点来看待这些国家。艾森豪威尔的中东政策咨文对中东各国人民是最大的不义。
    声明说，美国之所以要强调中东地区的“共产主义威胁”，只是为了掩饰众所周知的霸占这一地区的自然财富的目的。
    在谈到美国对中东国家提供的经济援助时，声明指出，阿拉伯各国的政府早已声明，他们决不接受附有一定条件的援助。声明说，美国计划“对中东局势的稳定是严重的威胁”。
    声明还肯定了阿拉伯国家对积极中立政策的信心，并且表示阿拉伯国家在最困难的环境下也要坚持这种政策。
    据新华社13日讯　约旦公众坚决抗议美国强迫阿拉伯国家接受“艾森豪威尔主义”，并且激烈谴责美国这项奴役中东国家的计划。
    一份有六千多安曼居民签名的拍给美国驻约旦大使馆的电报说，阿拉伯人抗议美国统治集团企图以填补中东的莫须有的“真空”为借口，来强迫阿拉伯国家接受“艾森豪威尔主义”。电报说，“艾森豪威尔主义”的目的是以建立“美国在这个地区的帝国主义统治来代替破了产的统治。”
    约旦全国阵线领袖阿卜杜拉赫曼·舒凯尔说，约旦现在和将来都同阿拉伯国家一起进行反对美国干涉中东事务的斗争。舒凯尔代表约旦人民对苏联支持阿拉伯国家人民反对帝国主义的斗争表示感谢。
    据新华社开罗13日电　开罗电台1月11日广播的一篇评论说，最近也门的事件“使艾森豪威尔计划受到考验。”它说，这个计划大谈要拯救中东的和平，但是，英国对一个像也门那样的独立国家的侵略却并没有引起美国方面的反应，这是极为令人遗憾的。
    这家电台说，“现实证明，对中东人民的独立的侵略仍然来自帝国主义者和受帝国主义者支持的国家”。
    新华社13日讯　开罗消息：据中东通讯社报道，苏丹民族联合党主席、前总理伊斯梅尔·阿扎里说，“艾森豪威尔主义”是干涉中东国家内政的行动。
