Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, January 29th - Joint Communiqué of Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People's Republic of China, and Acharya, Prime Minister of the Government of the Kingdom of Nepal

    At the invitation of Acharya, Prime Minister of the Government of the Kingdom of Nepal, Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People's Republic of China, arrived in Kathmandu on January 25, 1957, for a friendly visit.

    During Premier Zhou Enlai's friendly and goodwill visit to Nepal, the two Prime Ministers held talks in a very harmonious atmosphere. In the spirit of the close and friendly talks they held in Beijing, the two Prime Ministers reviewed and reaffirmed the traditional friendship that has existed between China and Nepal since ancient times. The two Prime Ministers affirmed that since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Nepal and the signing of the agreement to maintain friendly relations, the close friendly relations between the two countries have been constantly growing, and expressed their satisfaction with this.

    The two Prime Ministers believe that their respective visits to each other's countries have also proved to be conducive to the further development of Sino-Nepalese friendly relations. In their view, such visits and cultural and economic exchanges between the two countries will greatly strengthen the bond of Sino-Nepalese friendship.

    The two Prime Ministers expressed their concern for the comprehensive development of their two countries, and believe that world peace is extremely necessary for the progress and prosperity of China, Nepal, Asian and African countries, and the world. The two Prime Ministers reiterated their support for the Bandung Principles, and expressed satisfaction that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence (Panchsheel) jointly advocated by China and India have been widely supported and accepted by many countries in Asia, Africa, and the world. The two Prime Ministers agreed that Asian-African solidarity is of great significance for maintaining world peace. To accomplish this great task, Asian and African countries should transcend their minor differences with each other. Although Asian and African countries have different political systems, they are united in the great goal of safeguarding their respective national independence and freedom, building their respective countries, and promoting the welfare of their respective peoples. The two Prime Ministers believe that this commonality of goals provides the basis for their mutual solidarity. They further pointed out that the solidarity between countries in their minds is not limited to Asian and African countries, but also provides a basis for the true solidarity of all peace-loving countries in the world.

    The two Prime Ministers unanimously believe that all countries in the world will eventually recognize the great significance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and that the humanitarian spirit of mankind will finally prevail and overcome the arrogance of relying on strength arising from the possession of weapons of mass destruction.

    The two Prime Ministers were very pleased to have this opportunity to meet, and were deeply moved by the friendly feelings of the people of the two countries. They believe that this is the true foundation for the further development of Sino-Nepalese friendship.

    周恩来总理和阿查里雅首相联合公报
    新华社加德满都29日电　中华人民共和国总理周恩来和尼泊尔王国政府首相阿查里雅的联合公报
    中华人民共和国周恩来总理应尼泊尔王国政府阿查里雅首相的邀请在1957年1月25日到达加德满都进行友好访问。
    在周恩来总理在尼泊尔进行友好和亲善的访问期间，两国总理在非常和谐的气氛中举行了会谈。两国总理根据他们在北京举行的亲密和友好会谈的精神，回顾并且重新肯定了自古以来就存在于中尼两国之间的传统友谊。两国总理确认，自从中尼两国建立了外交关系并且签订了保持友好关系的协定以来，两国间亲密的友好关系有了不断的增长，并且对此表示满意。
    两国总理认为他们各自到对方国家去的访问，也证明是有利于中尼友好关系进一步的发展的。在他们看来，这样的访问和两国间的文化和经济交流，将大大地加强中尼友好的纽带。
    两国总理对于他们两国的全面发展表示了关切，并且认为，为了中国、尼泊尔、亚非和世界各国的进步和繁荣，世界和平是极其必要的。两国总理重申他们对于万隆原则的支持，并且对于由中国和印度共同倡导的和平共处的五项原则（潘查希拉）得到亚非和世界上许多国家的广泛支持和接受表示满意。两国总理一致认为亚非团结对于维护世界和平具有重大意义。为完成这一巨大任务，亚非国家应该超出他们彼此之间的细小分歧。尽管亚非国家有着不同的政治制度，但是在维护他们各自的民族独立和自由、建设他们各自的国家和推进他们各自人民的福利的伟大目标上，亚非国家是一致的。两国总理认为，这种目标的一致性就提供了他们相互团结一致的基础。他们并且进一步指出，他们心目中的各国之间的团结，并不限于亚非国家，而且也为世界上一切爱好和平国家的真正团结提供了基础。
    两国总理一致认为世界上所有国家最后将会认识到和平共处五项原则的重大意义，而人类的人道主义精神将终于取得上风并且战胜由于掌握了大规模毁灭性的致命武器而产生的依靠实力的骄横。
    两国总理非常高兴能够有这次会晤的机会，并且为两国人民的友好感情所深深感动。他们认为这是中尼友谊进一步发展的真实基础。
