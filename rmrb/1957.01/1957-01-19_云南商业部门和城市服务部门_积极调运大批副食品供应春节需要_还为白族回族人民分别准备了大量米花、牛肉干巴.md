    Yunnan Commercial Departments and Urban Service Departments
    Actively Transfer a Large Number of Non-Staple Foods to Supply Spring Festival Needs
    Also Preparing a Large Amount of Rice Flowers and Beef Jerky for the Bai and Hui Peoples Respectively
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Kunming, 17th) The commercial departments and urban service departments of Yunnan Province are actively transferring a large number of non-staple foods to supply the needs of the Spring Festival. As of the beginning of January, 2.5 million kilograms of sugar and 22,000 head of live pigs have been prepared in storage. During the Spring Festival, the industrial areas of Kunming, Gejiu, and other places will have an average of one *jin* of fresh pork, lard, and cured meat available per person. In addition, a considerable amount of cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks, fish, etc., will be supplied to the market. Urban service departments have also transferred ample seafood, cigarettes, alcohol, etc.
    This year's supply of non-staple foods in Yunnan during the Spring Festival, with the exception of pork which is less than last year due to insufficient sources, has increased greatly for other New Year goods. The amount of sugar has doubled compared to last year, and seafood has increased more than tenfold.
    In order to enable the minority peoples to have a good Spring Festival, the grain departments of the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture have also allocated 30,000 *jin* of grain to trade companies for processing rice flowers. Kunming City has prepared a large amount of beef jerky to supply the Hui people. The textile companies have also transferred various fabrics to border areas such as Simao and Lincang.

    云南商业部门和城市服务部门
    积极调运大批副食品供应春节需要
    还为白族回族人民分别准备了大量米花、牛肉干巴
    本报昆明17日电　云南省的商业部门和城市服务部门，积极调运大批副食品供应春节需要。到1月上旬为止，已准备了二百五十万公斤糖，库存生猪两万二千头。春节期间，昆明、个旧等工业地区，平均每人可吃到一市斤鲜猪肉、猪油和腊肉。此外，将有相当数量的牛、羊、鸡、鸭、鱼等供应市场。城市服务部门还调运了充分的海货、烟、酒等。
    今年云南在春节期间的副食品供应工作，除猪肉因货源不足比去年较少外，其他年货都有大量增加，糖比去年增加一倍，海货比去年增加十倍多。
    为了使少数民族人民过好春节，大理白族自治州的粮食部门还拨出三万斤粮食给贸易公司加工米花；昆明市准备了大量的牛肉干巴，供应回族人民；纺织品公司也把各种布匹调往思茅、临沧等边疆地区。
