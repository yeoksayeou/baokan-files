    "Radishes as Luggage" and Other Matters
    Wang Lin
    Everyone knows that radishes are a very cheap vegetable, but now some people are actually spending a lot of freight to transport radishes by buying luggage tickets. Isn't this a rare and strange thing in ancient and modern times?
    The incident occurred in the Chaigoubao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huai'an County, Hebei Province. This cooperative planted a lot of radishes last year, and the harvest was very good. The Huai'an County Supply and Marketing Cooperative sent people to purchase them, and the cooperative was also willing to sell the radishes to them. However, the local market price was three cents per jin, but the Supply and Marketing Cooperative was only willing to pay one and a half cents. The price difference was so large that the deal naturally fell through. The agricultural cooperative decided to transport the radishes to Jining for sale themselves. At this time, the Huai'an County Supply and Marketing Cooperative came out to make trouble again, saying that they had already booked all the wagons at Chaigoubao Station, and the agricultural cooperative could not use them. The members of the Chaigoubao Agricultural Cooperative did not understand the truth, and were unwilling to watch their fruits of labor rot in vain, so they had to reluctantly spend a lot of money to buy tickets and transport the radishes to Jining as luggage.
    This kind of strange thing is not unique to Huai'an County. The Zhuolu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative and two agricultural cooperatives near Zhuolu City signed a contract for the exclusive purchase of vegetables. After the vegetables were harvested, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative could not sell them, and they were not allowed to sell them themselves, resulting in the rotting of 200,000 jin of eggplants and green peppers.
    There are many similar phenomena in other commercial departments. For example, the Liangjiadian purchasing group of the Yutian County Food Company in Hebei Province stipulated the so-called "removing feed to ensure quality" method when purchasing live pigs, which meant deducting forty jin of feed and water for large pigs and twenty jin for small pigs. The purchasing group of Fengrun County asked farmers to send pigs one day in advance when purchasing live pigs, and then starved the pigs for a day before weighing them the next day, calling it "examining the trough to deduct weight." Manager Jiang of the Daming County Oil Company saw that there were many people selling peanuts in the Beifeng District, so he instructed the purchasing group to lower the peanut purchase price, giving only six yuan and forty cents per hundred jin of peanuts. Such erroneous behaviors seriously harmed the enthusiasm of the masses for production and directly affected the relationship between the Party, the government, and the people.
    The fundamental task of purchasing and marketing work is to meet the needs of national construction and the people's production and life, support the development of industrial and agricultural production, and both complete the state's plans and take care of the people's interests. However, many commercial department employees one-sidedly believe that "it is good to make money for the country," and do not understand that harming the people's interests is also harming the country's interests. Some commercial leading departments praise the units that have made money, regardless of the reason, which has fueled the development of the above-mentioned erroneous practices.
    Recently, the Financial and Trade Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted an inspection of the food company system's implementation of purchasing policies, and has notified the Party groups of all provincial commercial departments to launch an inspection of their units' implementation of policies, completion of plans, and business management in conjunction with the study of the "Eighth National Congress" documents, in order to effectively correct the errors that violate policies and are divorced from the masses.

    “萝卜当行李”及其它
    王林
    谁都知道，萝卜是价钱很便宜的蔬菜，可是现在居然有人用打行李票的办法花很多运费来运萝卜，这不是古今中外罕见的奇事么？
    事情发生在河北省怀安县的柴沟堡农业生产合作社。这个社去年种了不少萝卜，而且收成很好。怀安县供销合作社派人到这里来收购，社里也很愿意把萝卜卖给他们。可是当地的市价是三分钱一斤，供销合作社只肯给一分五厘钱，价格相差悬殊，自然不能成交。农业社决定自己把萝卜运往集宁出卖。这时，怀安县供销社又出来作怪，说他们已经包了柴沟堡车站所有的车皮，农业社不能动用。柴沟堡农业社的社员们不了解真情，又不愿眼睁睁地看着自己的劳动果实白白烂掉，只好忍痛花了许多钱，把萝卜当行李买票运到了集宁。
    这种怪事，并非怀安县所独有。涿鹿县供销社和涿鹿城附近的两个农业社订立了蔬菜包销合同。蔬菜收获以后，供销社推销不了，又不准农业社自销，结果烂掉了二十万斤茄子和青椒。
    在其他商业部门也有不少类似现象。如河北省食品公司玉田县亮家店收购组在购买生猪的时候，规定了大猪除去食水四十斤、小猪去食水二十斤的所谓“去食保等”办法。丰润县的收购组收购生猪，叫农民先一天送猪，把猪饿上一天第二天过秤，名之曰“考槽扣重”。大名县油脂公司的蒋经理，在北峰区看到卖花生的人很多，就指示收购组降低花生收购价格，每百斤花生只给六元四角钱。诸如此类的错误行为，严重地伤害了群众的生产积极性，直接影响了党、政府和人民群众的关系。
    购销工作的根本任务，是满足国家建设和人民生产、生活的需要，支持工业农业生产的发展，既要完成国家的计划，又要照顾人民的利益。但许多商业部门的从业人员片面地认为“给国家赚钱就好”，不了解损害了人民利益也就是损害国家利益。有些商业领导部门，对赚了钱的单位，不问原因一律表扬，这就助长了上述种种错误做法的发展。
    最近，中共河北省委财贸部对食品公司系统执行收购政策的情形进行了检查，并已通知省级各商业部门的党组，结合“八大”文件的学习，发动全体干部和职工对本单位执行政策、完成计划和经营管理进行一次检查，以切实纠正违背政策、脱离群众的错误。
