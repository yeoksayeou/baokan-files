    "Eisenhower Doctrine" Too Risky
    Former U.S. Secretary of State Acheson Expresses Opposition
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 11th - Former U.S. Democratic government Secretary of State Acheson, when testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 10th, opposed the U.S. "Eisenhower Doctrine" for the Middle East, believing it was "a policy that is really too risky."
    Acheson said that the plan requesting authorization to use U.S. military force "sounds very dangerous, like another step towards the brink." He pointed out that Eisenhower's request was "not only unnecessary, but also inappropriate," and the power sought was "vague and ambiguous."
    Acheson said that he had analyzed Eisenhower's request and Dulles's interpretation, and the result of the analysis made him believe that the consequence of this policy would be the authorization to use atomic weapons. He said: "This carries an extreme adventurousness" and "may cause serious miscalculations. This is not a place for empty threats."

    “艾森豪威尔主义”太冒险
    前美国国务卿艾奇逊表示反对
    据新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：美国前民主党政府国务卿艾奇逊10日在众议院外交委员会作证的时候，反对美国对中东的“艾森豪威尔主义”，认为这是“一条实在太冒险的方针”。
    艾奇逊说，要求授权使用美国军事力量的计划“听起来十分危险，像是又一次走向边缘”。他指出，艾森豪威尔的要求“不仅不是必要的，而且是不适宜的”，所寻求的权力是“模糊的和含糊的”。
    艾奇逊说，他对艾森豪威尔的要求和杜勒斯的解释作了分析，分析的结果使他相信这个政策的后果将是授权使用原子武器。他说：“这带有一种极端的冒险性”。并且“可能造成严重的失算。这里是不能进行虚声恫吓的。”
