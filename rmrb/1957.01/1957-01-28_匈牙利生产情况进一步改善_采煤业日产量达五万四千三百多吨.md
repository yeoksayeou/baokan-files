　　Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 26th: According to the Hungarian News Agency, production in Hungary is steadily increasing.

　　In Csepel, a famous industrial area of Hungary, the number of workers participating in production in major metallurgical factories has reached more than 80% of what it was before the October events last year. Currently, these factories produce about 350 tons of steel, 200 tons of steel pipes, more than 290 tons of steel sheets, 400 bicycles, 20 motorcycles, 80 sewing machines, and other products daily.

　　Hungarian vehicle manufacturing plants have also set production plans for the first quarter of this year, stipulating that output should reach 50% to 80% of pre-October event levels. A portion of the total products will be for export.

　　The food supply situation in Hungary, especially in the capital, Budapest, is also continuously improving. "People's Will" newspaper published an article pointing out that Budapest now has a fairly adequate food supply, and there should be no shortages in the first quarter. The Soviet Union will supply Hungary with 1,900 wagonloads of potatoes during this quarter.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 27th: The daily output of coal in Hungary reached 54,394 tons on the 24th. This is the third day after the daily coal output exceeded 50,000 tons since the October events, an increase of 2,905 tons compared to January 23rd.

　　Hungarian Minister of Heavy Industry Zottner gave a talk to the press about the increase in coal production. He said that in August last year, more than 94,000 people worked in coal mines in Hungary, which decreased to between 30,000 and 35,000 by November. Now, there are 83,000 miners in our coal mines. On November 19th last year, our daily output was only 3,571 tons, but since January 22nd of this year, the daily output has exceeded 50,000 tons. Zottner said: Considering various possibilities, we have set the coal industry's coal mining plan for this year at 18.3 million tons.

    匈牙利生产情况进一步改善
    采煤业日产量达五万四千三百多吨
    新华社布达佩斯26日电　据匈牙利通讯社报道：匈牙利目前生产正稳步增加。
    在匈牙利著名工业区切佩尔，各大冶金工厂目前参加生产的工人已经达到去年十月事件前的80％以上。现在，这些工厂每天约生产三百五十多吨钢、二百吨钢管、二百九十多吨薄钢板、四百辆自行车、二十辆摩托车、八十架缝纫机和其他产品。
    匈牙利各车辆制造厂也已经订出了今年第一季度的生产计划，规定产量应达到去年十月事件前产量的50％到80％。在全部产品中，将有一部分供出口用。
    匈牙利目前的食品供应情况特别是首都布达佩斯的供应情况也在不断改善。“人民意志报”曾发表文章指出，布达佩斯现在有相当充分的食品，第一季度不致发生供应不足的情况。苏联将在这一季度中供给匈牙利一千九百车皮马铃薯。
    据新华社布达佩斯27日电　匈牙利煤的日产量在24日达到五万四千三百九十四吨。这是十月事件后煤的日产量突破五万吨的第三天，比1月23日又多生产了二千九百零五吨。
    匈牙利重工业部部长佐特纳就煤产量增加一事向报界发表了谈话。他说，在去年8月，匈牙利有九万四千多人在煤矿中工作，到11月时就减少到三万到三万五千人之间。现在，我们的煤矿中有八万三千名矿工。去年11月19日，我们的日产量只有三千五百七十一吨，但是自从今年1月22日起，日产量已经超过五万吨。佐特纳说：考虑到各种可能性，我们已经把今年煤炭工业的采煤计划定为一千八百三十万吨。
