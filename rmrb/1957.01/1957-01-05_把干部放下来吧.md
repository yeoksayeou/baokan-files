    Let the Cadres Down
    To the Editor:
    I think the article "A Good Way to Strengthen Grassroots Organizations" published in the People's Daily on December 22 is correct. It shows that sending working groups to go deep into the grassroots to promote work is not a fundamental way to strengthen grassroots leadership. Only by transferring a large number of cadres with rural work experience to enrich grassroots organizations can we fundamentally strengthen grassroots leadership.
    I am a township cadre. Based on my personal experience, I feel that the role of sending working groups down is relatively limited. Although the task of the working group is to understand the situation in a timely manner and solve problems in a timely manner, in reality, it may be possible to understand the situation in a timely manner, but it is not easy to solve problems in a timely manner. Because many problems in grassroots organizations have been formed over the years and are more complex, it takes time to solve them, and more arduous and in-depth work needs to be done. Can the working group complete this task? They go down for a month at most, and ten days or half a month at least. It is difficult to understand the problem and solve the problem in such a short period of time. Even if some problems seem to be solved on the surface, they are often not solved fundamentally, so there are still a lot of problems after they leave; therefore, the fundamental way to strengthen grassroots organizations should be to transfer stronger cadres down. It is necessary to send working groups to check their work and help them with their work, but it is far from enough. Moreover, I don’t understand, since the leading organs draw a large number of cadres to form working groups and inspection teams to send down to help with the work, not only today but also tomorrow, then why not put them in the grassroots organizations! How eagerly we long for someone to help us with our work for a long time!

    把干部放下来吧
    编辑同志：
    12月22日人民日报发表的“加强基层组织的一个好办法”一文，我认为是正确的。它说明上级机关只派工作组深入基层去推动工作，不是加强基层领导的一个根本办法，只有抽调大批有农村工作经验的干部充实基层组织，才是加强基层领导的根本办法。
    我是一个乡干部，根据我的切身体会，我觉得派工作组下去的作用是比较有限的，工作组的任务虽然是及时了解情况，及时解决问题，但实际上，及时了解情况也许可以办到，要及时解决问题却并不容易。因为基层组织中的很多问题是经年累月形成的，比较复杂，所以解决起来也需要时间，而且要做比较艰巨的深入的工作。工作组能够完成这个任务吗？他们下去多则一月，少则十天半月，想在这么短的时间里了解问题、解决问题是有困难的。即使表面上看起来解决了一些问题，但往往不是从根本上解决问题，所以他们一走，问题还是一大堆；因此加强基层组织的根本办法应该是抽调较强的干部下去，仅仅派工作组去检查他们的工作，去帮助他们的工作虽然是需要的，却是很不够的。而且，我不明白，既然领导机关抽出大批干部组成工作组、视察队派下去帮助工作，不但今天派，明天还要派，那么为什么不把他们就放到基层组织中呢！我们是如何渴望着有人长期帮助我们工作啊！
