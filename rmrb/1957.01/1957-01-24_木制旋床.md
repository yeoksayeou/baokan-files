    Wooden Lathe
    In the carpentry workshop of the Hangzhou Southeast Cotton Textile Factory, a wooden lathe was recently added. Except for the roller head and cutting tools, it is entirely made of wood. The parts processed by this lathe all meet specifications.
    In the past, the Southeast Cotton Textile Factory sent the parts of the looms to iron factories for processing and repair. Because the iron factories had tight production schedules, the processing and repair were very untimely. Sometimes it took four or five months to deliver the goods. In the fourth quarter of last year, Yang Shengxiang from the production technology section and Shi Hongfu and Shi Yaokun from the carpentry workshop jointly researched and made this wooden lathe, which helped the factory overcome the difficulty of untimely parts processing.

    木制旋床
    杭州东南棉织厂的木工场里，最近添设了一部木制旋床，除了轧头、切削刀等处以外，全部是用木料制成的。这台旋床加工出的零件都合乎规格。
    东南棉织厂过去都把织布机上的零件送到铁工厂去加工修配。由于铁工厂的生产任务紧，加工修配很不及时，有时竟拖延四、五个月还不能交货。去年第四季度，生产技术课的杨生祥和木工场的施鸿福、史耀坤三个人共同研究，做成了这台木制旋床帮助工厂克服了零件加工不及时的困难。
