Soviet New Films

“And Quiet Flows the Don”
The famous novel “And Quiet Flows the Don” by the Soviet writer Mikhail Sholokhov has been adapted into a screenplay by Soviet People's Artist Sergei Gerasimov, and the Gorky Film Studio in Moscow has begun filming it under his direction. The film is divided into three parts: upper, middle, and lower, which are being filmed simultaneously, and it is expected to be completed before the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution this year. Sholokhov himself also participated in the film script and is preparing to go to the filming location to assist in person.

The filming location has been selected in the suburbs of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky on the banks of the Donets River. In a village called Gichinsk, it has been arranged according to the description of the Tatar village in "And Quiet Flows the Don". Many sets have also been set up in the southwestern suburbs of Kamensk, such as stations and water towers. Old-fashioned locomotives and carriages have appeared on the tracks there.

The actors arrived at this place long before the location shooting started in order to familiarize themselves with the local conditions and the life of the Cossacks. Many of the actors in this film are appearing on the screen for the first time. Grigory Panteleyevich Melekhov is played by Glebov, an actor from the Stanislavsky Theatre. Natalia Mironovna Korshunova is played by Kiriyenko, a student at the Film Academy. Aksinia Astakhova is played by the young actress E. Bystritskaya, who played the heroine in the film "An Unfinished Story" and played it very successfully. Director Gerasimov and the original author Sholokhov jointly selected her to play Aksinia Astakhova from twenty or so candidates.

In addition, thousands of people, including residents of rural areas around Kamensk, Soviet soldiers, local theater actors, and amateur troupe actors, participated in the filming of the mass scenes.

“The Forty-First”
The short story "The Forty-First" by the famous Soviet writer Lavrenyov is already familiar to Chinese readers. Now this novel has been made into a film by the Moscow Film Studio.

The brave and revolutionary girl, Maryutka, is played by the young actress Izvitskaya, who expresses Maryutka's innocence and enthusiasm very well. The White Army lieutenant is played by Strzhenov, who also excellently portrays the inner contradictions and complex psychological state of this image. (Jun) (Attached picture)

    苏联新电影
    “静静的顿河”
    苏联著名作家萧洛霍夫的名著“静静的顿河”已由苏联人民演员格拉西莫夫改编成电影剧本，并在他的导演下由莫斯科高尔基制片厂开始拍摄了。这部电影共分上、中、下三集，三集同时拍摄，预计将在今年十月革命四十周年以前完成。萧洛霍夫本人也对这个电影脚本参加了意见，并且准备亲自去到拍摄地点协助。
    这部影片的外景已选定在顿涅茨河畔的卡明斯克—沙赫亭斯基城郊拍摄。在一个名叫吉钦斯克的村庄里，已按照“静静的顿河”中所描写的鞑靼村的样子布置起来了。在卡明斯克城的西南郊也安置了许多布景，如车站、水塔等。那里的铁轨上已出现了老式火车头和车厢。
    演员们在外景开拍以前很久就到了这个地方，为的是熟悉当地情况和哥萨克人的生活。这部影片中很多演员是第一次上银幕。扮演葛利高里·潘苔莱耶维奇·麦列霍夫的是斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基剧院的演员戈列包夫。扮演娜塔莉亚·米伦诺芙娜·珂尔叔诺娃的是电影学院的学生基里因科。婀克西妮亚·阿司塔霍娃则由年青的演员艾·贝斯特里茨卡娅扮演，她曾在影片“没有说完的故事”中演过女主角，而且演得很成功。她饰婀克西妮亚·阿司塔霍娃是导演格拉西莫夫和原作者萧洛霍夫两人共同从二十来个候选者之间选中的。
    此外，参加拍摄群众场面的还有卡明斯克一带农村的居民、苏军战士、地方剧院演员和业余剧团演员等数千人。
    “第四十一”
    苏联著名作家拉甫列涅夫的短篇小说“第四十一”是中国读者早已熟悉的。现在这部小说已由莫斯科电影制片厂摄制成影片了。
    那位刚强勇敢、充满革命热情的姑娘玛柳特迦，是由青年演员伊兹维茨卡娅扮演的，她很好地表达出了玛柳特迦的纯真和热情。白军中尉是由斯特里仁诺夫扮演的，他也出色地表现出这个形象的内心矛盾和复杂的心理状态。　（君）（附图片）
