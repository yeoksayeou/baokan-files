    Hunan Rewards Activists in Eliminating Illiteracy
    (Our dispatch) The Hunan Province held a representative conference of activists in eliminating illiteracy from January 9th to 12th this year. At the conference, forty-seven advanced units received group awards, and five hundred and seventy-five individuals received individual awards. Last year, more than four million farmers, 210,000 workers and residents in Hunan Province participated in literacy learning, of which more than 500,000 farmers and 70,000 workers and residents reached the standard for graduating from illiteracy elimination programs. More than 523 advanced units and more than 15,000 activists in eliminating illiteracy emerged throughout the province.
    The improvement of the cultural level of the broad masses of workers and peasants has promoted work and production. In the winter of 1955, the Qiantang Cooperative of Dapu Township, Hengshan County, could not find even three work recorders besides the accountant. Now, 23 farmers in the cooperative have been liberated from illiteracy, 12 people have become team work recorders, and 8 people have served as teachers in people's schools. Therefore, less time and fewer errors are made in work evaluation and point recording.
    The representative conference of activists in eliminating illiteracy also laid out the work for the future. It called for seizing the current favorable opportunity in winter to further mobilize the vast number of illiterate people to enroll in school, quickly establish and improve grassroots illiteracy elimination associations, strengthen the leadership of grassroots units in eliminating illiteracy, improve teaching work, and improve teaching quality.

    湖南奖励扫除文盲积极分子
    本报讯　今年1月9日至12日，湖南省召开了扫除文盲积极分子代表大会。会上有四十七个先进单位得到团体奖，有五百七十五人得到个人奖。去年，湖南省有四百多万农民，二十一万职工和居民参加识字学习，其中有五十多万农民，七万多职工和居民达到了扫盲毕业标准。全省涌现了扫除文盲先进单位五百二十三个，扫盲积极分子一万五千多人。
    广大工农群众文化水平的提高，对工作和生产起了推动作用。衡山县大浦乡浅塘社在1955年冬，除会计外，连三个记工员都找不出。现在该社已有二十三个农民脱离了文盲状态，有十二人当了小组记工员，八人担任了民校的教师。因此，在评工记分中，就减少了不少的时间和差错。
    扫除文盲积极分子代表大会还布置了今后的工作。要求抓紧目前冬季有利时机，进一步动员广大文盲入学，迅速建立和健全基层扫盲协会，加强基层单位对扫除文盲工作的领导，改进教学工作，提高教学质量。　（麓安）
