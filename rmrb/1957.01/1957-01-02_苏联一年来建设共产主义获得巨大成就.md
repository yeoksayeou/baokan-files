Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 1st: An editorial in "Pravda" on December 31st stated that the Soviet Union had achieved many new accomplishments in communist construction in 1956.

    In the past year, the Soviet Union's production of means of production increased by more than 11%. In 1956, steel production was 49 million tons, and the annual increase in steel production was almost equal to the total annual steel production in 1913. Coal production in 1956 was nearly 430 million tons, compared to 29 million tons in 1913. Oil production in 1956 was 84 million tons, an increase of 13.2 million tons compared to 1955, and the annual increase was almost one and a half times the total annual oil production in 1913. Electricity production in 1956 reached 192 billion kilowatt-hours, compared to 170.1 billion kilowatt-hours in 1955. In just one year, the increase in electricity production was almost eleven times the total electricity production in 1913.

  The article pointed out that the United States' steel production in 1956 increased to 1.8 times that of 1929, while the Soviet Union increased tenfold. During the same period, the United States' oil extraction increased to 2.5 times, while the Soviet Union increased sixfold. During the same period, the United States' power generation increased sixfold, while the Soviet Union increased thirty-onefold. The development speed of the socialist national economy is many times faster than the economic development speed of capitalist countries during times of prosperity.

    The article went on to say that the continuous progress of industrial production technology is the decisive condition for the further high tide of the entire industrial production. Our country has entered an era of genuine industrial and technological revolution, which, in terms of its significance and scale, surpasses all past industrial and technological reforms many times over.

    When discussing agricultural achievements, the article said that this year's harvest is unprecedented in our history. Compared to 1955, the state's grain procurement and purchase volume increased by one billion poods. The state purchased and procured 3.8 million tons more milk and 2.7 million tons more potatoes than in 1955. The agricultural product production level of many advanced collective farms and state farms in 1956 has already reached the level stipulated to be achieved by the end of the Sixth Five-Year Plan.

    The achievements made in the development of industrial production and agricultural production allow us to firmly implement the program to improve the people's living standards adopted by the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    The article pointed out that, looking back on the past year, the Soviet people clearly see that the source of our victory lies in the strong vitality and superiority of the truly people's Soviet system and the socialist economic system.

    苏联一年来建设共产主义获得巨大成就
    许多重要产品的增长速度都比美国快许多倍；苏联已进入了真正的工业和技术革命的新纪元；苏联人民清楚地看到这些胜利的源泉在于苏维埃制度和社会主义制度的强大生命力和优越性。
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”12月31日发表的编辑部的文章说，1956年，苏联在共产主义建设方面获得了许多新的成就。
    过去一年，苏联生产资料的生产提高了11％以上。1956年，钢产量是四千九百万吨，钢的全年增加量几乎等于1913年钢的全年产量。1956年煤产量将近四亿三千万吨，而1913年是二千九百万吨。1956年石油产量是八千四百万吨，比1955年增加了一千三百二十万吨，全年增加量几乎等于1913年石油年产量的一倍半。1956年电力产量已经达到一千九百二十亿度，而1955年是一千七百零一亿度，仅仅在一年内，电力增加量几乎等于1913年电力总产量的十一倍。
  文章指出，1956年美国的钢产量增为1929年的一点八倍，苏联增长为十倍；美国在同一时期石油开采量增长为二点五倍，苏联增长为六倍；美国在同一时期发电量增长为六倍，苏联增长为三十一倍。社会主义国民经济的发展速度甚至比资本主义国家的经济在繁荣时代发展的速度都要快许多倍。
    文章接着说，工业生产技术的不断进步是整个工业生产的进一步高涨的决定性条件。我们的国家进入了真正的工业和技术革命的纪元，这个革命不论就它的意义和它的规模来说，都超过过去的一切工业技术改革许多倍。
    文章在谈到农业成就的时候说，今年的收获量在我国历史上是空前的。同1955年相比，国家的粮食征购和收购量增加了十亿普特。国家收购和征购牛奶的数量比1955年多三百八十万吨，马铃薯多二百七十万吨。许多先进的集体农庄和国营农场的农产品的生产水平在1956年已经达到了规定在第六个五年计划结束时应达到的水平。
    在发展工业生产和农业生产中取得的成就，使我们可以坚定地实现苏联共产党第二十次代表大会通过的提高人民生活水平的纲领。
    文章指出，回顾过去的一年，苏联人民清楚地看到我们胜利的源泉在于真正人民的苏维埃制度和社会主义经济制度的强大生命力和优越性。
