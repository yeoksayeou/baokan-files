In the state-owned Harbin Woolen Mill, the workers affectionately call Master Zhou Yiming the factory's old steward.

With forty years of service, Master Zhou has selflessly cared for the factory and his comrades since liberation. He has served as the workshop director and the chief of the technical security section. Since 1954, when he took charge of the factory's labor protection work, he has lived in the factory, only going home on Saturday nights. He works in the factory day and night. When people are sound asleep, Master Zhou always makes it a habit to inspect the boiler room, substation, kitchen, and other accident-prone areas before returning to sleep. One spring night last year, he went to the boiler room for inspection and found the fireman Zhu Fengqi dozing in a chair, and the on-duty Li Yishan sleeping on a wooden board. At this time, Zhou Yiming hurried to check the water level and pressure gauge, which woke up Zhu Fengqi, who felt very ashamed. Zhou Yiming sincerely explained to Zhu Fengqi the importance of not dozing off while firing the boiler, and severely criticized the on-duty Li Yishan. With Zhou Yiming's frequent and patient education, the phenomenon of night shift workers dozing off at their posts is now rare.

Last year, there were several months without rain, and the weather was dry. One night, a strong wind suddenly blew. Zhou Yiming became alert, fearing that the wind would cause a fire, and he patrolled the factory all night. The factory director was very moved when he learned about this and has since gotten up to patrol at midnight whenever there are floods or strong winds.

Whenever Zhou Yiming sees a brick, a tile, or a screw on the ground in the factory, he picks it up and puts it in a designated place. Many of the factory's equipment guards, protective railings, and four small bungalows were manufactured and constructed using the iron pigment buckets, old iron bars, old wooden boxes, and old bricks he accumulated. Seeing that there were only dirt roads between the workshops, and the roads were muddy after the snow melted, he used broken bricks to pave a brick road during the holidays and planted trees along the road.

Zhou Yiming has a straightforward character and promptly and frankly criticizes the shortcomings of some employees, such as wasting state property, creating disunity, and being perfunctory, even the factory director is not exempt. At the same time, he is also very concerned about the hardships of the workers. Therefore, the workers respect and love him and are willing to report situations to him.

    工厂里的老管家
    新华社记者　陶肃琦
    在国营哈尔滨毛织厂里，职工们都亲热地把周义明老师傅叫作工厂的老管家。
    有四十年工龄的周师傅，自从解放以来，真是无微不至地爱护工厂、关心同志。他先后担任过工厂的车间主任和技术保安科长。从1954年起，他负责管理整个工厂的劳动保护工作以后，就搬到工厂里住，只是每星期六晚上回家住一宿。他在工厂里工作起来不分白天、黑夜，当人们熟睡的时候，周师傅总是习惯地去锅炉房、变电所和伙房等容易出事故的场所巡查一遍，然后再回来睡觉。去年春天的一个午夜，他到锅炉房检查，发现烧火工人朱风麒坐在椅子上打瞌睡，值班李益山躺在木板上睡觉。这时周义明赶忙去检查水位和气压表，结果惊醒了朱风麒，朱感到非常惭愧。周义明诚恳地向朱风麒讲明烧火不能打瞌睡的道理，并且严厉批评了值班的李益山。在周义明经常耐心的教育下，现在夜班工人在工作岗位上打瞌睡的现象很少见了。
    去年，曾经有好几个月不下雨，天气干燥，有一天晚上突然刮起大风，周义明警觉起来，怕大风引起火灾，彻夜在厂里巡查。工厂厂长知道这件事以后很受感动，以后，每逢遇到防汛、大风时节，他也在午夜起来巡查。
    周义明每当看到工厂地上有一砖一瓦、一个螺丝钉，都拣起来归到一定的地方。工厂里设备的很多防护罩、防护栏杆和四个小平房，都是用他积累起来的铁颜料桶、旧铁筋、旧木箱跟旧砖制造和建设起来的。他看到车间之间只有土道，下雪溶化以后道路很泥泞，就在假日利用碎砖铺了一条砖道，并且在道边上种了树。
    周义明性格爽直，对有些职工浪费国家资财、闹不团结。敷衍搪塞等缺点，都能及时、坦率地提出批评，连厂长也不例外。但是同时他也非常关心职工的疾苦。因此，职工们又敬他又爱他，都乐意向他反映情况。
