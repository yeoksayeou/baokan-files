Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 25th. The delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic, led by President Zápotocký, arrived in Moscow by special train at 3 p.m. today.

Present at the station to welcome them were Soviet Communist Party and state leaders Voroshilov, Bulganin, Mikoyan, Molotov, Saburov, Suslov, Khrushchev, Shvernik, and others.

Diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Soviet Union, representatives from all circles in Moscow, and Czechoslovak students studying in the Soviet Union also came to the station to welcome them.

After President Zápotocký alighted from the train, he accepted bouquets of flowers and, accompanied by Chairman Voroshilov, reviewed the honor guard. Zápotocký cordially shook hands with the Soviet leaders and foreign envoys one by one, and waved to the welcoming crowd.

Voroshilov, on behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, extended a warm welcome to President Zápotocký. He said that sincere relations and brotherly friendship exist and are actively developing between our two nations. This friendship is fully in line with the fundamental interests of our two nations and helps to further consolidate the socialist camp.

President Zápotocký said in his speech that we have come here as your dearest old friends and most loyal friends. Our friendship has a long tradition and will develop forever. When he talked about the impact of the Soviet revolution on the Czechoslovak people, he said that the Soviet Union, as the center of the socialist camp, is the result of historical development, and going against this fact would lead to mistakes.

After the Czechoslovak guests left the station, they were welcomed by the crowds gathered in the square in front of the station.
