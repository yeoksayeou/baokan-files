Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 10th: According to Antara News Agency, the Indonesian Cabinet meeting received notification on the evening of the 9th of the Masyumi Party's withdrawal from the Cabinet. The Cabinet meeting immediately adjusted the cabinet personnel to fill the vacancies left by the Masyumi Party. The main government party has decided to maintain the cabinet. The Masyumi Party's long-standing attempt to overthrow the current cabinet and form a Hatta government has finally failed.

After a meeting lasting more than four hours on the afternoon of the 9th, the Central Committee of the Masyumi Party issued a statement announcing its withdrawal from the Cabinet. The statement said that the Masyumi Party's proposal to invite other government parties to dissolve the cabinet was not supported, and continuing to participate in the current cabinet would "no longer be a responsible action." The statement expressed the Masyumi Party's hope to maintain "cooperative relations" with other government parties in the new situation.

After receiving the official notification from the Masyumi Party of the withdrawal of its cabinet members, the Cabinet meeting decided that Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo and Second Deputy Prime Minister Djalid (Islamic Teachers Association) would handle the duties of the First Deputy Prime Minister left by the Masyumi Party. Minister of Interior Sunarjo (Islamic Teachers Association) will temporarily serve as Minister of Justice, Minister of State Planning Juanda (non-party) will temporarily serve as Minister of Finance, Deputy Minister of Transportation Rosari (Catholic Party) will be appointed as Minister of Transportation, and Minister of Land Suhadi (Catholic Party) will temporarily serve as Minister of Public Works.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 10th: Today, most Indonesian newspapers believe that the Masyumi Party's withdrawal from the Cabinet has not been able to shake the Cabinet's position.

The "Indonesia Torch," the organ of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, said that a cabinet without the participation of the Masyumi Party still has sufficient strength and a strong backing, still has a majority vote in the parliament, and the armed forces unanimously support the current government, so there is no reason to retreat.

"Dongxing Daily" and "People's Daily" both believe that the forces actually supporting the Cabinet will be strengthened after the Masyumi Party's withdrawal. "Dongxing Daily" pointed out that the Masyumi Party was actually a hidden opponent and an obstructer of policy implementation during its participation in the Cabinet.

"Great Indonesia Daily," which opposes the current cabinet, had to admit that after the Masyumi Party's withdrawal, the Cabinet, with the support of the Indonesian Communist Party, would be able to take clear measures on the Central Sumatra and North Sumatra issues. However, this newspaper threatened that such measures could cause "bloodshed."

The Masyumi Party's organ, "Eternal Daily," said that it is not yet possible to predict what will happen after the Masyumi Party's withdrawal, but undoubtedly a "new situation" has emerged in Indonesian politics.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 10th: According to the Indonesian News Agency, Mangunsarkoro, the First Chairman of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, said today that the Masyumi Party's withdrawal from the Cabinet will help the Cabinet achieve a great degree of coordination in its future pace.

He said that after the Masyumi Party's withdrawal, the Cabinet would be better able to take "resolute action" when necessary, but its responsibility would also be heavier.

He also said that the current situation requires firm and tactful actions, with the aim of promoting the interests of the people and maintaining national unity. To achieve this goal, better cooperation between the government parties remaining in the Cabinet is necessary.

In answering questions, he said that his party has no intention of inviting the Communist Party to join the cabinet to replace the Masyumi Party. But if the Communists are willing to participate in the government, his party "will consider it," and "support from the Communist Party would certainly be accepted."

    马斯友美党退出内阁
    印度尼西亚政府调补空缺
    国民党主席说马斯友美党退出有助于内阁步调一致
    新华社雅加达10日电　据安塔拉通讯社消息：印度尼西亚内阁会议在9日晚上接到了马斯友美党退出内阁的通知。内阁会议随即调整了内阁的人选，填补了马斯友美党的遗缺。主要政府党已经决定把内阁维持下去。马斯友美党进行许久的推翻现内阁、组织哈达政府的企图终于失败。
    马斯友美党中央委员会在9日下午开了四个多小时的会议以后，发表了退出内阁的声明。声明中说，马斯友美党邀请其他政府党一起解散内阁的主张得不到支持，继续参加现内阁就“不再是一种负责的行动”。声明表示，马斯友美党希望同其他政府党在新的形势下继续维持“合作关系”。
    内阁会议接到马斯友美党撤回它的阁员的正式通知以后，决定由总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约和第二副总理查利德（伊斯兰教师联合会）处理马斯友美党留下的第一副总理的职务，由内政部长苏纳约（伊斯兰教师联合会）暂兼司法部长，国家计划部长朱安达（无党派）暂兼财政部长，交通部副部长罗萨里（天主教党）任交通部长，土地部长苏哈迪（天主教党）暂兼公共工程部长。
    据新华社雅加达10日电　今天印度尼西亚大多数报纸认为，马斯友美党退出内阁的行动，并没有能够动摇内阁的地位。
    印度尼西亚国民党机关报“印度尼西亚火炬报”说，没有马斯友美党参加的内阁还是有着充分的实力和强大的后盾，在国会里还是拥有多数票，而武装部队也一致支持现政府，因此没有理由向后退缩。
      “东星报”和“人民日报”都认为马斯友美党退出以后，实际支持内阁的力量将加强。“东星报”指出，马斯友美党在参加内阁期间，实际上是隐藏着的反对者和政纲实施的阻挠者。
    反对现内阁的“大印度尼西亚报”也不得不承认马斯友美党撤出后，内阁在印度尼西亚共产党的支持下，能够对中苏门答腊和北苏门答腊问题采取明确的措施。但是这家报纸威胁说，这种措施是可能引起“流血”的。
    马斯友美党机关报“永恒日报”说，马斯友美党撤出后将会发生什么情况，现在还不能预料，但无疑印度尼西亚政治上已经出现了一个“新局面”。
    新华社雅加达10日电　据印度尼西亚新闻社报道，印度尼西亚国民党第一主席曼贡萨科罗今天说，马斯友美党退出内阁的行动，会有助于内阁在今后的步调上取得很大程度的协调。
    他说，在马斯友美党退出以后，内阁就更能够在必要时采取“坚决的行动”，但是它的责任也更加重了。
    他还说，目前的局势要求采取坚定和机敏的行动，其目的是增进人民的利益和维护国家的统一。为了达到这个目的，留在内阁里的政府党之间更好的合作是必要的。
    在答复问题时他说，他的党无意邀请共产党入阁去代替马斯友美党。但是如果共产党人愿意参加政府，他的党“会加以考虑”，“来自共产党的支持当然是会被接受的”。
