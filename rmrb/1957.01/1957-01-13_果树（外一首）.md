Fruit Tree (and another poem)
——In an orchard in Yanbian

Old man Hu Zhao led us to a tree, gently patting the trunk with his hand. Looking up, a miracle appeared before our eyes—seven or eight kinds of fruits shimmering among the branches and leaves: greenish pears, pink crabapples, heavy apples colliding with each other... A breeze rustled through the leaves, the fruits on the tree gently conversing. The old man smiled, his face full of spring breeze: "This is a tree I grafted myself. Don't you think it looks like our motherland, our friendly multi-ethnic family? Deep roots and lush foliage, abundant fruits, our motherland is strong and young!"

　　Mountain wind is coming
　　Mountain wind is coming
　　Mountain wind is coming
　　Rolling in from the foot of the mountain
　　Sweeping in from the woods
　　Crude and fierce
　　Invading the orchard…

　　Quickly pull up the grass ropes
　　To support the heavy fruits
　　Quickly erect the props
　　To hold up the bent branches
　　Fruits, do not panic and clamor
　　The mountain wind will pass in a moment
　　And you will still be graceful and serene
　　Bathing in the sunset...

    果树（外一首）
    ——在延边的一个果园里
    胡昭老人引我们来到一棵树下，手扶着树干轻轻地拍打，向上看，奇迹出现在眼前——七八种果实在枝叶间摇闪：青绿的洋梨，粉红的海棠，沉重的苹果在互相冲撞……微风吹过树叶儿飒飒，满树的果实在轻轻谈话。老人笑起来满面春风：“这是我亲手嫁接的树种。“你看这像不像我们的祖国，我们多民族友好的大家庭？“根深叶茂，果实丰盛，我们的祖国强壮而年青！”	山风来了山风来了山风来了从那山脚下滚来从那树林里卷来粗野而凶暴向果园侵袭……快拉起一条条草绳把沉甸甸的果实托住快竖起一根根支架把弯下来的树枝擎起果实呵，不要惊慌地喧嚷山风一霎时就会过去而你们，仍将雍容而恬静沐浴在夕阳里……
