    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 7th. An Egyptian government spokesman denied on the 5th the rumors spread by some Westerners that Egypt had requested economic aid from the United States. He said that Egypt's economic and financial situation is good.
    The spokesman said that Egypt did not ask the United States for economic aid. Egypt only requested the United States to unfreeze Egypt's funds amounting to 50 million US dollars and to allow Egypt to purchase wheat from the United States in Egyptian pounds in accordance with the agreement it concluded with the United States. However, these requests were rejected.
    In explaining Egypt's financial situation, the spokesman said: "Egypt has earmarked 45 million Egyptian pounds for production plans in this year's budget, while only 17 million Egyptian pounds have been used in this area in the past five months, which proves that it does not need assistance now." He also cited the continuous rise in cotton prices to further prove that Egypt's economic situation is stable.

    埃及否认向美国要求经济援助
    新华社开罗7日电　一位埃及政府发言人5日否认某些西方人士散布的埃及曾经要求美国给埃及经济援助的消息。他说，埃及的经济和财政状况是良好的。
    这位发言人说，埃及并没有向美国要求经济援助。埃及只是要求美国把埃及数达五千万美元的款项解冻，并且让埃及按照它同美国缔结的协定用埃镑向美国购买小麦。但是，这些要求被拒绝了。
    这位发言人在说明埃及的财政状况时说：“埃及在今年的预算中以四千五百万埃镑用在生产计划上，而在过去五个月内在这方面只用了一千七百万埃镑，这就证明了它现在还不需要援助”。他还引用棉花价格的不断上涨来进一步证明埃及的经济状况是稳定的。
