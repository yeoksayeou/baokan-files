    Plucking Flower Buds and Drawing Lots
    Zhang Menggeng

    If someone plucks flowers in a park or certain public places, everyone will surely say he has no morals. But flower pluckers can also be divided into several levels, and the most immoral are probably those who pluck flower buds. Because flower buds are different from newly opened flowers and blooming flowers. They are still budding and have the most potential. If plucked and taken back, they will bloom, but the potted flower that is plucked will never have new flowers!

    In the old society, peddlers selling candied haws usually carried a gambling tool called a lot tube. People who drew lots, like all gamblers, wanted to draw a lot from that big handful that would bring them the most profit, and they would never care whether the hawker's small business would collapse.

    The situation of going to the park to pluck flower buds and drawing lots to buy candied haws is naturally rare or even completely absent in the new society. But it has acquired a "new" content, which is reflected in the similar matter of state-owned theater troupes randomly poaching people from private professional theater troupes.

    Those who poach people, of course, pick those with development prospects, or pick the best ones. Like those who secretly pluck flower buds and draw lots, they only want to enrich their own troupes, but the people who are poached are actors who have just been painstakingly cultivated by private professional troupes, or the main roles of private professional troupes. After they are poached, how will the troupe perform, and how will a group of artists live? They don't care.

    Poaching people, poaching lead roles, and stealing lead roles with large sums of money were common occurrences in old opera troupes in the past, but at that time, this kind of behavior was also called "immoral behavior" by the artists. It was hated to the bone, and ordinary people dared not do it. Only those wealthy and powerful troupes dared to do it. Unexpectedly, some individual state-owned theater troupes with organization and leadership are actually doing such things now. Please listen to the following dialogue.

    Cadre: "Come to our troupe! State-owned is more promising than private, the treatment is generous, there is political status, and it is standardized. How much money do you earn here?"

    Artist: "Earning sixty or seventy yuan."

    Cadre: "We'll give you one hundred and forty yuan there."

    Artist: "That would be great! But what if the troupe doesn't agree?"

    Cadre: "It doesn't matter, go there and talk about it!"

    This straightforward approach is called "stealing" by the artists. Others who are less bold use this method. They "mobilize" the artists in this way: "You first request to withdraw from the troupe, anyway, they can't stop you, you have the freedom to choose a profession, which is stipulated in the constitution. We will take care of living expenses after you withdraw from the troupe. After a few months, go to our state-owned theater troupe, and it will have nothing to do with them." This method is called "feeling around" by the artists. Whether it's "stealing" or "feeling around," neither is an aboveboard thing, but individual state-owned theater troupes have indeed done this. Not to mention the distant past, in recent months, many private professional theater troupes in Beijing have had a lot of people poached by individual state-owned theater troupes. For example, Luo Huilan of the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe was stolen by a state-owned theater troupe in Xinjiang with a high salary of 900 yuan a month (her original salary was 400 yuan); the Harbin Broadcasting Rap Troupe also poached Zhao Chuntian and Yu Shide of the Beijing Quyi Troupe No. 3 without any procedures (300 yuan per month for both and half a month's salary was paid in advance); the Political Department of the Air Defense Command is poaching Sun Yanqin, an actor from the Beijing Quyi Troupe; in addition, the qin player of Wu Suqiu of the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe No. 4 has been poached, and so on. This practice has put many private professional theater troupes in Beijing in a state of turmoil. They worry about this matter all day long, fearing that misfortune will fall on their troupe; they run around appealing, demanding an end to this practice of harming others to benefit themselves. At the mention of "poaching people," they have the feeling of "turning pale at the mention of the tiger."

    Only by improving the quality of performances can private professional theater troupes guarantee the livelihood of the artists; and the primary condition for improving the quality of performances is to have a solid troupe and a neat lineup of actors. State-owned theater troupes should vigorously help private professional theater troupes in this regard, and if necessary, should even send directors and actors to private professional theater troupes. The practice of individual state-owned theater troupes plucking flower buds and drawing lots from private professional theater troupes is obviously wrong. It is hoped that these state-owned theater troupes that violate policies, laws, and discipline will stop the "stealing" and "feeling around" practices and stop the devastation of private professional theater troupes!

    掐花骨朵和抽签
    张梦庚
    有人在公园或某些公共场所里掐花，大家一定说他没德行。但是掐花的人也分几等，最没德行的恐怕要算是掐花骨朵的了。因为花骨朵同刚开的花和盛开的花不一样，它含苞未放，最有前途，掐回去后，即会盛开，可是被掐掉的那盆花就永没有新花了！
    旧社会里，卖糖葫芦的大都带有一种赌博的工具，叫签筒子。抽签的人如同一切赌徒一样，他们都想从那一大把签子里抽出一根能使自己获利最多的来，至于卖糖葫芦的小本生意是否垮台，他是绝不理会的。
    到公园里去掐花骨朵，买糖葫芦抽签的情形，在新社会里，自然是极少或者甚至完全没有的了。但是它却有了“新”的内容，那就是体现在国营剧团到民间职业剧团来乱拉人这件类似的事情上。
    拉人的人当然是挑着有发展前途的拉，或者挑着好的抽。与偷掐花骨朵和抽签的人一样，他们只想充实自己的剧团，而拉走的人是民间职业剧团千辛万苦刚培养出来的演员，或者是民间职业剧团的主要角色，拉走后，剧团如何演出，一群艺人如何生活呢，他们是不管的。
    拉人，抽角儿，用大价钱偷角儿，在以往旧戏班社里是常见不奇的事，不过当时这种行动也被艺人们称为“缺少道德的行为”，是恨之入骨的，是一般人不敢办的，只有那些有钱有势的成班人才敢办。想不到现在有组织有领导的个别国家剧团居然做起这样的事来。请听听下面这一段对话吧。
    干部：“到我们剧团去吧！国营比民营有前途，待遇优厚，有政治地位，正规化。你在这里挣多少钱？”
    艺人：“挣六、七十元”。
    干部：“到我们那里给你一百四十元。”
    艺人：“好倒好！剧团不答应呢？”
    干部：“没有什么关系，去了再说！”
    这种直截了当的做法，艺人们称为“偷”。还有胆子小点的，是用这样的方法。他们这样“动员”艺人：“你先要求退团，反正他们不能硬拦你，你有选择职业的自由，这是宪法上规定了的。退团后生活费我们管，等几个月，再到我们国家剧团去，就与他们无关了。”这种方法艺人叫做“摸”。无论“偷”和“摸”，都不是光明正大的事，但是个别国家剧团确实这样做了。远的不说，最近几个月来北京市的一些民间职业剧团就被个别国家剧团拉走了不少的人。如北京京剧团的罗惠兰就被新疆的一个国营剧团用一月九百元的高额薪金偷走了（她原来薪金四百元）；哈尔滨广播说唱团也没有经任何手续将北京市曲艺三团赵春田、于世德等人拉走了（两人每月三百元并先付了半月薪金）；防空司令部政治部文工团正在拉北京曲艺团的演员孙砚琴；此外还有北京市京剧四团吴素秋的琴师被拉走了，等等。这种作法使北京市很多民间职业剧团经常陷于动荡不安的状态中。他们整天为这件事情耽心，害怕不幸落到自己团里来；他们到处奔走呼吁，要求终止这种损人利己的做法。一提到“拉人”的事，他们就有“谈虎色变”的感觉。
    民间职业剧团只有提高演出质量，艺人生活才有保障；而提高演出质量的首要条件就是有巩固的剧团和整齐的演员阵容。国家剧团应该在这方面大力帮助民间职业剧团，必要时甚至应该向民间职业剧团输送导演和演员。个别国家剧团向民间职业剧团掐花骨朵与抽签的做法显然是错误的。希望这些违犯政策法纪的国家剧团，终止“偷”“摸”的做法，终止对民间职业剧团的摧残！
