    A Mouthpiece for the "Eisenhower Doctrine"
    The four Muslim countries participating in the Baghdad Pact, namely Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Pakistan, recently held a meeting in Ankara. Judging from the communiqué issued after the meeting, it actually touted the U.S. aggressive policy and acted as a mouthpiece for the "Eisenhower Doctrine."
    The four-nation communiqué described the "Eisenhower Doctrine," the U.S. attempt to dominate the Middle East, as "the best plan that can be found" to "maintain" peace in the Middle East and "improve the economic conditions of the people in this region." This statement is inconsistent with the actual situation in the Middle East, and it is also inconsistent with the actual situation in countries like Turkey and Iraq. The four countries participating in the meeting accepted so-called "U.S. aid" long ago. According to their current statement, the political and economic situation in these countries should have been "improved" long ago. However, what have these countries gained from accepting "U.S. aid" except for the fact that their military expenditures are as high as 40% to 60% of their budgets, which has caused their own financial and economic difficulties? For the entire Middle East region, the U.S. military aggressive bloc policy has split the unity of Arab countries, weakened the strength of the Middle Eastern people's struggle against colonial rule, and seriously threatened the independence of Middle Eastern countries and peace in the region. As Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Syrian President Kuwatly said in their joint statement on the 21st: The interference by major powers through military treaties and alliances is detrimental to peace and stability in the Middle East. It is no accident that the people of the Middle East regard the Baghdad Pact group as a "large prison for the Arab nation."
　　The four-nation meeting communiqué did not mention a word about the British and French aggression against Egypt, the atrocities of France in North Africa, or the fact that Britain armed and attacked Yemen, but echoed the U.S.'s cliché of the so-called "communist threat" to the Middle East. However, this completely untrue slander will not be believed by the people of other countries in the Middle East, nor will it be believed by the people of the four countries participating in the meeting. This is because the Soviet Union and other socialist countries do not have a single soldier or military base in the Middle East, and they do not want a drop of Middle Eastern oil for nothing; while the United States and British and French colonialists possess these privileges in the Middle East. Therefore, what threatens the national independence of Middle Eastern countries and what threatens peace in the Middle East today is by no means "communism," but precisely the Western colonial countries.
　　On the issue of free navigation of the Suez Canal, the four-nation meeting of the Baghdad Pact similarly acted as a mouthpiece for the United States. In the communiqué, they had to admit Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal on the one hand, but on the other hand, they said that they "hope that the canal will be free from the influence of any country's national policy." This statement is actually the statement of the United States, and the purpose is to deprive Egypt of exercising national sovereignty over the Suez Canal. The four-nation communiqué expressed "regret" over the Syrian people's destruction of oil pipelines in Syria to support the Egyptian people's struggle against British and French aggression, which clearly exposed the purpose of this meeting.
　　The so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" of the United States to invade Middle Eastern countries was met with angry condemnation from the people of the Middle East and Asian-African countries as soon as it emerged. It was unanimously believed that this was American-style colonialism in which the United States attempted to replace the position of Britain and France in the Middle East and enslave the people of the Middle East. The meeting of the four Muslim countries participating in the Baghdad Pact was obviously held at the instigation of the United States. The purpose is to peddle the U.S. "Eisenhower Doctrine" aggressive plan to other Middle Eastern countries. However, the attitude of the four countries' authorities in echoing the U.S. aggressive policy will only bring harm to peace in the Middle East and serious consequences to their own countries.

### “艾森豪威尔主义”的传声筒

    “艾森豪威尔主义”的传声筒
    参加巴格达条约的土耳其、伊拉克、伊朗和巴基斯坦等四个穆斯林国家，最近在安卡拉举行了一次会议。从它们会后发表的公报看来，这个会议实际上是在替美国侵略政策捧场，做了“艾森豪威尔主义”的传声筒。
    四国公报把美国企图独霸中东的“艾森豪威尔主义”，说成是“维持”中东地区和平和“改善这个地区的人民的经济情况所能找到的最好的计划”，这种说法既不符合中东地区的实际情况，也不符合土耳其、伊拉克等国家的实际情况。参加会议的四个国家很早就接受了美国的所谓“援助”，按照它们现在的说法，这些国家的政治和经济情况早就应该有所“改善”了，可是，这些国家接受“美援”的结果，除了使它们的军费开支高达预算的40％至60％，因而引起本国的财政经济困难以外，它们还得到了什么呢？对于整个中东地区来说，美国的军事侵略集团政策分裂了阿拉伯国家的团结，削弱了中东人民反对殖民统治斗争的力量，使中东国家的独立和这一地区的和平受到了严重的威胁。正如印度总理尼赫鲁和叙利亚总统库阿特利在21日的联合声明中所说：大国通过军事条约和同盟来进行干涉，是有损于中东的和平和稳定的。中东人民把巴格达条约集团看成是一座“阿拉伯民族的大监狱”，这绝不是偶然的。
  四国会议公报对于英法侵略埃及，对于法国在北非的暴行，对于英国武装进攻也门的事实，都只字不提，却随声附和美国的所谓“共产主义威胁”中东的滥调。但是，这种完全违背事实的诽谤，不仅中东地区其他国家的人民不会相信，就是参加这个会议的四个国家的人民也不会相信。因为苏联和其他社会主义国家在中东地区没有一兵一卒，没有一个军事基地，没有白要中东的一滴石油；而在中东拥有这些特权的，正是美国和英法殖民主义者。因此，今天威胁中东国家民族独立的，威胁中东和平的，决不是什么“共产主义”，而恰恰是西方殖民国家。
    巴格达条约四国会议在苏伊士运河自由通航问题上，同样做了美国的传声筒。它们在公报中一面不得不承认埃及对苏伊士运河的主权，一面却又说什么“希望运河脱离任何国家的国家政策的影响”。这种说法实际上正是美国的说法，目的就是要剥夺埃及对苏伊士运河行使国家主权。四国公报对叙利亚人民破坏叙境油管，以支援埃及人民反抗英法侵略的斗争，居然表示什么“遗憾”，这就清楚地暴露了这个会议召开的目的。
    美国侵略中东国家的所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”刚一露头，就遭到了中东和亚非国家人民的愤怒谴责，一致认为这是美国企图在中东取代英法地位、奴役中东人民的美国式的殖民主义。参加巴格达条约的四个穆斯林国家会议，显然是在美国授意下举行的。目的是在向其他中东国家兜售美国“艾森豪威尔主义”侵略计划。但是，四国当局这种附和美国侵略政策的态度，只会给中东地区的和平带来损害，给它们自己的国家带来严重的后果。
