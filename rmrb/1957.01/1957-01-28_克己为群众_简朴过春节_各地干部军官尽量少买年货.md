Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 26th: Cadres of Shanghai's various agencies and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai are preparing to celebrate the festival frugally, buying as few New Year goods as possible, so that ordinary citizens can have a better Spring Festival. Under the call of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, many cadres are also trying to persuade their families to buy fewer New Year goods. Wang Kun, Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Food Company, recently went to Sichuan to purchase cured meat for Shanghai citizens for the festival, but his own family has decided not to buy cured meat or cellophane noodles, which are New Year goods needed by citizens.

Officers and soldiers stationed in Shanghai also resolutely responded to the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's call to buy fewer New Year goods and meat, and have actively reduced their holiday needs plans. The Shanghai Garrison Military Service Agency stipulates that the supply of pork per person during the Spring Festival should be two-thirds less than that of ordinary residents, and the number of eggs and cellophane noodles should be reduced by 70% and 60% compared to last year. The Donghai Fleet directly subordinate agency military service agency originally ordered 5,000 catties of pork and 500 chickens for officers for the festival, but these have now been returned, and the normal supply level will be maintained during the festival.

According to materials from the Shanghai Service Bureau, thanks to the hard work of purchasing personnel and the frugality of cadres and officers, the market supply of various holiday non-staple foods this year can generally meet the needs of citizens' increased purchasing power. State-owned and joint-venture stores are now adding supply points and increasing counters in workers' new villages and other areas with insufficient stores to facilitate citizens' purchases.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, January 25th: Many agencies in Jiangxi Province will buy less pork and non-staple foods during the Spring Festival to meet the needs of the masses first.

The Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee has 21 canteens under its jurisdiction, 12 of which guarantee that they will not buy even a tael of pork on the market during the Spring Festival, and will slaughter and distribute the pigs they raise themselves. The other nine canteens, calculated at half a catty per person, are still short of more than 2,000 catties of pork, which will be supplied by the Provincial People's Committee canteen pig farm. The Pingxiang Coal Cadre School, in addition to its own consumption, also plans to sell the three fat pigs it raises to the food company to supply workers and residents for a happy Spring Festival.机关工作人员，也热烈响应了这一号召。 Ninejiang County mountain workers also warmly answered this call. The Chengguan District of Jiujiang County originally planned to buy 15 catties of pork, but now only plans to buy seven or eight catties. A large fat pig collectively raised by the supply and marketing cooperative in the district, which was originally planned to be slaughtered for its own consumption, is now decided to be sold to the food company to supply local farmers.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, January 27th: Many agency canteens in Hangzhou are trying to buy less pork before and after the Spring Festival.

The collective canteens of ten agencies including the Hangzhou Municipal People's Committee will buy 5,000 catties less pork during the Spring Festival, which can supply more than 1,000 households with pork for a happy Spring Festival. The Hangzhou Municipal People's Committee canteen, which serves more than 1,000 people, decided to use 500 catties less pork and purchase more beef, mutton, fish, and preserved duck and other foods that are in sufficient supply on the market when studying how to celebrate the Spring Festival well. This canteen also considered that the number of people from other places visiting Hangzhou during the Spring Festival would increase, and restaurants would be very crowded, so it decided to supply some famous Hangzhou dishes and small steamed dumplings and pot stickers to reduce the number of staff members going to restaurants for meals. The Third Canteen of the Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Agency Affairs is preparing to buy less pork and use other non-staple foods that are in relatively sufficient supply to make more varieties.

    克己为群众　简朴过春节
    各地干部军官尽量少买年货
    ·上海·
    据新华社上海26日电　上海市各机关干部和人民解放军驻沪部队官兵们准备俭朴过节，尽量少买年货，让一般市民春节过得更好些。许多干部在中共市委的号召下，也尽量说服家中少买年货。上海市食品公司副经理王坤最近曾亲自到四川去为上海市民采购过节咸肉，但他自己家中已决定不买咸肉、粉丝这些市民需要的年货。
    驻沪部队官兵们也坚决响应中国人民解放军总政治部少买年货和肉类的号召，纷纷削减节日需要计划。上海警备区军人服务社规定春节每人供应猪肉比一般居民少三分之二，鸡蛋和粉丝的数量比去年减少了70％和60％。东海舰队直属机关军人服务社原为军官订购了过节猪肉五千斤，鸡五百只，现已退掉，节日仍保持平常供应水平。
    据上海市服务局的材料，由于采购人员的辛勤奔波和干部、军官们的节约，今年市场供应的各种节日副食品一般都能满足市民购买力增长的需要。现在各国营和合营商店正在工人新村和其他商店不足的地区增设供应点、增加货柜，以便利市民购买。
    ·江西·
    新华社南昌25日电　江西省许多机关将在春节期间少买猪肉和副食品，尽先满足群众需要。
    江西省人民委员会所属单位共有二十一个食堂，其中有十二个食堂保证春节时不到市场上购买一两猪肉，将自己单位所养的生猪自宰分食，有九个食堂每人按半斤计算，还缺猪肉二千多斤，决定由省人民委员会食堂养猪场供应。萍乡煤炭干部学校除自己食用外，还准备将自养的三头肥猪卖给食品公司，供应工人、居民欢度春节。在农村工作的机关工作人员，也热烈响应了这一号召。九江县城山区原计划买猪肉十五斤，现在只准备买七、八斤，该区供销社集体养的一头大肥猪，原计划自宰食用，现在决定将这头肥猪卖给食品公司，供应当地农民。
    ·杭州·
    新华社杭州27日电　杭州市许多机关食堂设法在春节前后少买猪肉。
    杭州市人民委员会等十个机关集体食堂在春节期间将少买五千斤猪肉，这些猪肉可以供应一千多户居民欢度春节用。有一千多人用餐的杭州市人民委员会食堂，在研究如何过好春节的时候，决定少用五百斤猪肉，多采购一些市场上供应充分的牛肉、羊肉、鱼、酱鸭等食品。这个食堂还考虑到春节期间外地来杭州游览的人增多，饮食店会很拥挤，决定供应一些杭州名菜和小笼蒸饺、锅贴等面食，使本单位的工作人员少到饮食店去用膳。浙江省机关事务管理局第三食堂准备少买猪肉，用其他供应比较充足的副食品多做一些花样。
