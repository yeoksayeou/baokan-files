 The Yangtze River Bridge Piers Are All Above Water

    (Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch, January 14th) At five o'clock in the morning on January 14th, in a temperature of four degrees below zero, the No. 4 bridge pier of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge emerged above the water. From now on, all eight bridge piers in the river of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge have been built above the water.

    Steel beams have been erected on all four completed piers. The pier body elevation of the No. 5, 6, and 7 piers in the river has reached about 30 meters (the entire pier body elevation is more than 43 meters). It is expected that all piers will reach the design elevation in February. The highway bridge deck on the main bridge has also been installed up to the No. 2 pier in the river. The approach bridges on both banks are also under intense construction; the arched approach bridges, one arch at a time, from the foot of Turtle Mountain in Hanyang, are advancing towards the riverbank.

    长江大桥桥墩全部修出水面
    本报武汉14日电　1月14日清晨五点钟，在零下四度的气温下，武汉长江大桥的四号桥墩修出了水面。从此，武汉长江大桥的江中八个桥墩已经全部修出了水面。
    在已经全部完工的四个桥墩上，都架上了钢梁。江中五、六、七号三个桥墩的墩身标高达到了三十公尺左右（整个墩身标高是四十三公尺多），预计在2月份全部桥墩达到设计标高。正桥上的公路桥面板，也安装至江中二号墩。两岸的引桥也在紧张的进行着；从汉阳龟山脚下一孔一孔的拱形引桥，正向江边推进。　（长江日报编辑部）
