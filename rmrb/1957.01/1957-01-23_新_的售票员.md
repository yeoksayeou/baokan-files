    "New" Ticket Collectors
    A tramcar was travelling southeast from the Nanshi tram station in Tianjin. Upon arrival, a ticket collector jumped off the tram and busied himself looking after the passengers. No one had ever seen a ticket collector like this before. Who could he be? Some ticket collectors took a closer look and realized that it was Guo Ziliang, the Director of the Rolling Stock Factory of the Tianjin Tram Company. On another tram, there was also a new ticket collector. This ticket collector was Comrade Liu Xuezeng, a member of the Party branch committee of the Rolling Stock Factory.
    Why did the factory director and the Party branch committee member start working as ticket collectors? It turns out that recently, many ticket collectors were suffering from influenza and unable to work. In order to complete the task of transporting passengers, many office staff from the Rolling Stock Factory, led by the director, went to work on the trams as temporary ticket collectors. (Ren Zhi)

    “新”的售票员
    一辆电车从天津南市电车站东南方驶来，到站后一个售票员从车上跳下来忙着照顾乘客。过去从来没有见过这样一位售票员，他是谁呢？有些售票员仔细一看，原来是天津电车公司有轨厂郭子良厂长。在另一辆电车上也有一个新售票员，这位售票员是有轨厂的党支部委员刘学增同志。
    为什么厂长和党支部委员都当起售票员来了呢？原来是这样：最近不少售票员患流行性感冒，不能参加工作，为了完成运送旅客的任务，于是在厂长的带动下，有轨厂许多内勤同志都到车上代做售票员了。　（任之）
