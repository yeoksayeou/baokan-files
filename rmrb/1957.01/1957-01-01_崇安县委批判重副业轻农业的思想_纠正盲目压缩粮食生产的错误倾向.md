    Chong'an County Party Committee Criticizes the Ideology of Emphasizing Sideline Occupations and Neglecting Agriculture
    Correcting the Erroneous Tendency of Blindly Reducing Grain Production
    (Our newspaper's reporter in Fujian reports) The Chong'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Fujian Province is vigorously reversing the erroneous tendency of emphasizing sideline occupations and neglecting agriculture, and blindly reducing grain production, which is growing among some cadres. It has determined that in 1957, it will focus on grain production, while simultaneously developing forestry, tea cultivation, animal husbandry, and other sideline productions to achieve comprehensive production development.
    Chong'an County is a mountainous area. Since the beginning of winter, many rural cadres in this county have believed that developing grain production is not cost-effective: it requires a lot of labor but yields little profit, so it's better to engage in more sideline occupations, and some even plan to abandon their mountain rice paddies. Therefore, when formulating production plans for 1957, many townships were unwilling to actively develop grain production. The Huangbai Township Party Branch and work team planned to abandon 1,370 mu of low-yield paddy fields in the township when planning production for 1957. If combined with land converted to tea and tung trees, the township's paddy field area would be reduced by 14.3% compared to 1956. Some responsible cadres in individual districts even proposed converting double-cropping rice to single-cropping rice in 1957. In Chishi District, almost the entire team in some cooperatives went to engage in sideline occupations, abandoning agricultural production. The county's winter wheat planting task has already been lowered compared to last year, and there is still a danger of not completing it.
    After conducting in-depth investigation and research, the county party committee discovered this problem and immediately convened an enlarged cadre meeting at the county, district, and township levels. The meeting summarized the achievements in agricultural production throughout the year and educated cadres on the significant importance of developing grain production. Through practical discussions, the cadres at the meeting recognized that grain is a commodity of utmost importance for national construction and people's lives, and is also the foundation of agricultural production. At the same time, they also realized that, with the exception of a small number of purely tea-producing areas, the majority of the people in other areas have a demand for increased grain production. Farmers in Da'an Township have an average of over 580 jin of ration grain per person, but they still feel it's not enough and proposed increasing grain production by 4% in 1957. Zhou Bixiang, secretary of the Nili Township Party Branch, said, "Sideline production in our township accounts for 60%-70%, but the masses still demand to increase grain production, otherwise relying on outside supply isn't even worth the effort."
    After thorough democratic discussion, the entire county determined the policy of focusing on developing grain production in 1957, while simultaneously developing forestry, tea cultivation, animal husbandry, and other sideline productions to achieve comprehensive production development. The total grain output is required to increase by another 7% compared to 1956. Among the county's 44 townships, 34 townships where grain production accounts for more than 60% have determined to focus on developing grain production while simultaneously developing diversified economies. Nine remote mountainous townships have determined a production policy that gives equal importance to agriculture, forestry, and sideline occupations, but grain production should also increase appropriately. Only three townships will focus on developing tea production and sideline occupations.
    Currently, all parts of the county are vigorously publicizing and implementing this production policy, and mobilizing the masses to do a good job in winter production.

    崇安县委批判重副业轻农业的思想
    纠正盲目压缩粮食生产的错误倾向
    本报讯　本报驻福建记者报道：中共福建省崇安县委大力扭转部分干部中间正在滋长的重副业轻农业和盲目压缩粮食生产的错误倾向，确定1957年要以粮食生产为主，同时发展林业、茶业、畜牧业及其他副业生产的全面发展生产。
    崇安县是个山区。入冬以来，这个县许多农村干部，认为发展粮食生产不合算：花工大，收益少，不如多搞副业，甚至打算把山田抛荒。因此，许多乡在制定1957年生产规划时，不愿积极发展粮食生产。黄柏乡党支部、工作组在规划1957年生产的时候，把全乡一千三百七十亩产量较低的稻田抛荒。如果再加上改种茶树、桐树，全乡稻田面积将比1956年减少14.3％；也有少数区的负责干部，竟提出1957年要把双季稻改种单季稻；赤石区有的社几乎全班人马都去搞副业，把农业生产丢在一边。全县冬种小麦任务已比去年调低，还有完不成的危险。
    县委经过深入调查研究，发现这一问题以后，即在日前召开了县、区、乡三级扩大干部会，总结了全年农业生产的成绩，教育干部认识发展粮食生产的重大意义。到会干部从联系实际讨论这个问题中，认识到粮食是国家建设和人民生活中具有头等重要的物资，也是农业生产的基础。同时，还认识到除极少数纯茶业地区外，大部地区的群众都有增产粮食的要求。大安乡农民每人平均有口粮五百八十多斤，但还感到不充裕，提出1957年还要增产粮食4％；倪历乡党支部书记周碧祥说：“我们乡里副业生产占60％—70％，群众仍要求再增产些粮食，不然靠外地供应，连脚力也划不来。”
    经过充分的民主讨论，全县确定了1957年以发展粮食生产为主，同时发展林业、茶业、畜牧业及其他副业生产的全面发展生产的方针。粮食总产量要求比1956年再增产7％。全县四十四个乡中，粮食生产比重占60％以上的三十四个乡，确定以发展粮食生产为重点，同时发展多种经济；有九个偏僻山区乡，确定了农、林、副业并重的生产方针，但粮食生产也要适当增长；只有三个乡是重点发展茶业和副业生产。
    目前，全县各地正在大力宣传贯彻这一生产方针，动员群众搞好冬季生产。
