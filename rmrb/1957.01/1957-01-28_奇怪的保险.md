	Strange Insurance
    According to London newspapers: An oriental female dancer currently on tour in London has insured the baby in her womb: If she gives birth to twins, the insurance company will pay her 300 pounds in insurance money. Female movie star Pier Waight has insured the two dimples on her cheeks. If these two dimples disappear, she will receive 13,000 pounds in insurance money. The clown Bin Talpin insured the unique melancholic expression in his eyes, with an insurance amount of 20,000 pounds. After seeing these reports about "strange insurance," a reader of a London newspaper raised a very reasonable question: "What, after all, cannot be insured?"

    奇怪的保险
    据伦敦报纸刊载：正在伦敦作巡回演出的一位东方女舞蹈演员把自己腹中所怀的胎儿保了险：万一她这一胎生下来是双生儿的话，保险公司就要付给她三百英镑的保险金。女电影明星皮尔·华伊脱把自己脸颊上的二个酒窝保了险，一旦这二个酒窝消失的话，她就能取得一万三千英镑的保险金。小丑宾·塔尔品把他的眼睛所独有的那种忧郁的表情保了险，保险金额为两万英镑。在看到了这些关于“奇怪的保险”的消息以后，伦敦报纸的一位读者提出了一个非常合乎情理的问题：“到底有什么东西不能保险呢？”
