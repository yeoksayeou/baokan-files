    Kunming Military Region Troops Achieve Great Results in Helping the Masses in the Past Year
    (Our dispatch) Over the past year, the Kunming Military Region troops have made great achievements in mass work. In supporting the agricultural cooperative movement, according to incomplete statistics, the entire military region donated more than 100,000 yuan, purchased more than 1,600 various agricultural implements such as double-share plows, and also pledged more than 1.5 million yuan to purchase tractors. During the high tide of establishing cooperatives last year, the military region dispatched 722 cadres, who dispersed and went deep into the countryside to help establish, expand, and consolidate cooperatives for a long time under the leadership of the local Party and government. These comrades were able to connect with the masses in depth and share the joys and sorrows of the masses. When these comrades returned to the troops, the masses were reluctant to part with them. In the areas where land reform was carried out through peaceful consultation, the ethnic work teams of the troops also organized mutual assistance and cooperation among the fraternal ethnic groups in accordance with the Party's policies and the characteristics of each region. The ethnic work teams of the entire military region helped the masses build a total of 76 elementary cooperatives, 2 advanced cooperatives, and 467 mutual aid teams.
