Xinhua News Agency, December 31st, Moscow Dispatch (TASS): The Moscow correspondent for the French newspaper "l'Humanité," B. Entreastes, asked the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev: What are his wishes for the working people of France in the New Year?

Khrushchev replied that he was willing to extend his best wishes to the working people of France and all the French people through "l'Humanité."

Khrushchev said: The traditional friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and France, established in the two world wars against a common enemy, unites them. Now, when German militarists are raising their heads again, the people of our two countries should be more united and work together to safeguard and strengthen peace and security in Europe and the world.

The Soviet people hold deep fraternal feelings for the French working class and all working people who are heroically fighting for peace and democracy, and for the bright future of France. The working people of France have more than once set an example of resolutely resisting the dark reactionary forces and fascist forces, winning the praise of all freedom-loving humanity. Loyal to the spirit of proletarian internationalism, the French working class, under the leadership of its long-tested leader, the French Communist Party, has always been at the forefront of the struggle for the ideals of freedom and socialism.

Khrushchev said: I believe that the working class, working farmers, advanced intellectuals, and all democratic forces of France, as long as they work together, will certainly achieve success in the New Year in the struggle to prevent a new devastating war, to safeguard and consolidate peace, and to strive for the social progress and national dignity of their motherland. The working people of France can always regard the Soviet people as their most loyal friends.

I wish that 1957 will be a year of strengthened friendship and unity between the people of our two countries!

Dear friends, I wish you a happy New Year!

    赫鲁晓夫向法国人民祝贺新年
    希望他们在保卫和平的斗争中获得成就
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科31日讯：法国“人道报”驻莫斯科记者比·恩特热斯问苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫：在新年里，他对法国劳动人民有什么祝愿。
    赫鲁晓夫回答说，他愿意通过“人道报”向法国劳动人民和全体法国人民致以最好的祝福。
    赫鲁晓夫说：苏法两国人民在两次大战中反对共同敌人所建立起来的传统友谊把他们团结在一起。现在，当德国军国主义者正在再度抬头时候，我们两国人民应该更加团结和共同努力为维护和加强欧洲以及全世界的和平和安全而奋斗。
    苏联人民对为和平和民主、为法国美好的将来而英勇奋斗的法国工人阶级和全体劳动人民怀着深深的兄弟情谊。法国的劳动人民曾经不止一次地树立了坚决反抗黑暗的反动势力和法西斯势力的榜样，博得了整个爱好自由人类的赞扬。忠于无产阶级国际主义精神的法国工人阶级在自己的久经考验的领导者——法国共产党的领导下始终是为自由和社会主义的理想而战斗的先锋。
    赫鲁晓夫说：我相信，法国的工人阶级、劳动农民、先进知识分子和一切民主力量只要共同努力，在新的一年中一定会在为防止新的毁灭性的战争、维护和巩固和平、争取自己祖国的社会进步和民族尊严的斗争中取得成就。法国劳动人民可以永远把苏联人民看作是最忠实的朋友。
    预祝1957年是我们两国人民的友好和团结加强的一年！
    亲爱的朋友们，祝你们新年幸福！
