Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 19th: Jiangsu Province's fishery output in 1956 reached over 280,000 tons, exceeding the target for the final year of the First Five-Year Plan by 20%. In that year, the various aquatic products sold by fishermen and farmers to the state-owned aquatic product supply and marketing system increased by more than 90% compared to 1955.

More than 80% of the fishermen in Jiangsu Province have joined fishery (agricultural) production cooperatives. After joining the cooperatives, they have shown high enthusiasm for production, generally expanding the scope of production, improving equipment, and enhancing technology, thereby promoting development in production. Last year, the fishery cooperatives in the fourteen coastal counties and cities dispatched over 1,000 fishermen, more than 100 large boats, and more than 100 pairs of sampans to the waters off Zhejiang for hairtail fishing for the first time on a large scale, catching more than 20,000 dan in total. In key freshwater fishing areas, the implementation of measures combining fishing and breeding protection last year also increased fish production.

With the increase in fishery production, the lives of fishermen have been preliminarily improved. Last year, the income of fishermen in freshwater areas increased by 20% to 30% compared to the previous year. The Hongda Fishery Cooperative in Hongze Lake increased its output by 30% compared to the previous year. On average, each member of the cooperative received a new cotton-padded coat, and the cooperative added more than 40 new fishing boats. In the coastal areas, although the production of small yellow croaker was reduced due to wind last year and the production plan was not completed, the income of fishermen also increased by about 10% due to the development of year-round production operations.

    扩大生产　改善设备　提高技术
    江苏去年渔业产量达到二十八万多吨
    超过1957年产量指标20％
    新华社南京19日电　江苏省1956年渔业产量达到二十八万多吨，超过第一个五年计划最后一年指标20％。这一年，渔民和农民卖给国营水产供销系统的各种水产品，比1955年增加90％以上。
    江苏省有80％以上的渔民参加了渔（农）业生产合作社，他们入社后生产情绪很高，普遍扩大生产范围，改善设备和提高技术，因此，生产有了发展。去年沿海十四个县、市的渔业社，第一次大规模地出动一千多个渔民，一百多条大船和一百多对舢舨，到浙江海面试捕带鱼，共已捕到了两万多担。淡水重点渔区去年实行捕捞和繁殖保护相结合的措施，也提高了鱼产量。
    随着渔业的增产，渔民生活得到初步改善。去年，淡水地区渔民收入比前年增加20％到30％。洪泽湖洪大渔业社去年产量比上一年增加30％，全社平均每人添了一件新棉衣，社里新添渔船四十多只。在沿海地区，去年小黄花鱼生产虽然因风减产，没有完成生产计划，但是由于开展常年生产作业，渔民收入也增加了10％左右。
