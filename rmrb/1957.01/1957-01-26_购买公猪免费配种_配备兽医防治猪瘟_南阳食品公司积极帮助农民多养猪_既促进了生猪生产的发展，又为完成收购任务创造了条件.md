    Buying Boars for Free Mating; Equipping Veterinarians to Prevent Swine Fever
    Nanyang Food Company Actively Helps Farmers Raise More Pigs
    Promoting the Development of Hog Production and Creating Conditions for Completing Purchasing Tasks

    (Our report) The hog production in Nanyang County, Henan Province, has developed rapidly. The county's hog production in 1955 was 6,200 heads, and by 1956 it had increased to 100,200 heads. This year, the county plans to develop to 200,000 heads.

    The reason why the county's hog production has developed so rapidly is due to the vigorous leadership of the local Party and government leading organs, the active breeding of agricultural cooperatives, and the assistance of the Nanyang County Food Company. The company is relatively clear about the view of serving the development of production when arranging its business. Therefore, in the work of purchasing hogs, they pay attention to taking various active measures to promote the development of hog production. For example, they draw money from their business expenses to purchase boars and patrol various townships to provide free mating for sows raised by farmers; when purchasing and assigning pigs, they resolutely implement the practice of issuing meat coupons to pig farmers, and ensure that those who hold meat coupons to buy pork and lard are given priority supply and are available for purchase at any time. In order to solve the problem of insufficient piglets, in addition to organizing agricultural cooperatives to adjust themselves, they also transferred more than 700 piglets from places with more piglets in the county to support places with insufficient piglets on the principle of no profit and no loss; at the same time, they also set up two full-time veterinarians in the company to prevent and treat swine fever for farmers. As a result, this not only promoted pig production and won praise from farmers, but also created favorable conditions for the department to complete the task of purchasing hogs. (Mu Qing)

    购买公猪免费配种　配备兽医防治猪瘟
    南阳食品公司积极帮助农民多养猪
    既促进了生猪生产的发展，又为完成收购任务创造了条件
    本报讯　河南南阳县的生猪生产有了迅速的发展。这个县在1955年的生猪产量为六千二百头，到1956年已增加到十万零二百头。今年，全县计划发展到二十万头。
    这个县的生猪生产所以发展的这样快，除了当地党政领导机关的大力领导、农业社积极饲养外，与南阳县食品公司的扶助，也是分不开的。这个公司在安排本部门的业务的时候，对于为发展生产服务的观点，是比较明确的。因此，他们在收购生猪的工作中，就注意采取各种积极措施，来促进生猪生产的发展。例如他们从业务费中抽出钱来购买公猪，巡回到各乡为农民所饲养的母猪免费配种；在收购派购猪的时候，坚决贯彻发给养猪户肉票的作法，并作到对持肉票买猪肉、猪油者予以优先供应、随时买随时有。为解决仔猪不足问题，他们除组织农业社与农业社之间自行调剂外，还以不赔不赚为原则，在本县仔猪较多的地方调运了七百多头，支援仔猪不足的地方；同时，还在公司里面设了两个专职兽医，为农民防治猪瘟。这样作的结果，不仅促进了养猪生产，得到了农民的好评，还为本部门完成收购生猪的任务创造了良好的条件。　（牧青）
