Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 24th. At the Tianjin Municipal Outstanding Teachers Representative Conference, which closed yesterday, 255 outstanding teachers, 216 educational workers with more than 20 years of teaching experience and those who have made special contributions in certain areas, and 10 outstanding collectives were rewarded.

Guo Yunfeng, a 64-year-old history teacher at the No. 1 Middle School, has been engaged in education for 43 years. For decades, he has been consistently conscientious and responsible in his teaching work. He has accumulated rich teaching experience, but he still reads a lot of reference books and prepares lessons carefully before each class. This respected veteran teacher also often humbly seeks the opinions of other teachers to improve his teaching work. In history teaching, he can also carry out patriotism and love of labor education for students through specific examples. Therefore, his lectures are very popular among students.

Xu Renyou, a teacher at Dongmenli Dajie Primary School in Chengxiang District who is loved by students, is very patient in educating children. He once educated twenty particularly naughty children into excellent children. Hou Wenyuan, a student who used to be undisciplined and lax in his studies, understood how to love the collective, teachers, and classmates under his education. Once, Hou Wenyuan bravely jumped into the river from a bridge to save someone and was commended by the local public security police station.

This conference was held on the 21st. During the meeting, Ren Ziyong, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau, gave a brief summary of the education work in 1956 and a report on the basic tasks for 1957. He proposed that all education workers in the city should conscientiously implement the spirit of hard struggle, practicing economy, and running schools diligently and thriftily in the future, and further improve teaching and enhance the quality of teaching. He also emphasized the need to strengthen students' political and ideological education and labor education, and cultivate students' good qualities of observing discipline and loving labor.

    辛勤地为国家培养年轻一代
    天津大批优秀教师受到奖励
    新华社天津24日电　在昨天闭幕的天津市优秀教师代表大会上，有二百五十五名优秀教师，二百一十六位有二十年教龄以上的和在某一方面有特殊贡献的教育工作者，以及十个优秀集体得到了奖励。
    第一中学六十四岁的历史教师郭云峰从事教育工作已有四十三年，几十年来他对待教学工作一贯认真负责，他积累了丰富的教学经验，但他在每次教课之前都要阅读很多参考书，认真备课。这位德高望重的老教师还经常虚心地征求其他教师的意见来改进自己的教学工作。在历史教学中，他还能通过具体事例对学生进行爱国主义和热爱劳动的教育。因此，他讲课很受学生们欢迎。
    受学生爱戴的城厢区东门里大街小学教师徐仁佑，教育儿童很耐心。他曾经把二十个特别顽皮的孩子教育成优秀的儿童。过去学习散漫、纪律不好的学生侯文元，在他的教育下懂得了热爱集体、热爱老师和同学。有一次侯文元从一个桥上奋勇地跳下河去救人，曾受到当地公安派出所的表扬。
    这次大会是在21日举行的，会议期间天津市教育局副局长任子庸作了1956年教育工作的简要总结和1957年基本任务的报告。他提出，全市的教育工作者在今后应当认真贯彻艰苦奋斗厉行节约勤俭办学的精神，进一步改进教学提高教学质量。他并且着重提出要加强学生政治思想教育和劳动教育的问题，培养学生守纪律、爱劳动的优良品质。
