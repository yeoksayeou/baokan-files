Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 11th: The Northeast Institute of Finance and Economics has made organizing its faculty to compile suitable textbooks a priority for scientific research in the next two to three years.

In the past, when the Northeast Institute of Finance and Economics studied and adopted Soviet textbooks, it constantly paid attention to connecting them with China's reality. However, the actual situation in China was not discussed enough, not comprehensively, and not systematically. The institute requires that the compilation of textbooks this time should delve deeply into reality and systematically organize and analyze the achievements and experiences of China's financial and economic construction work. In general, the goal is to produce a first draft in the first year, conduct trial teaching in the second year, identify problems in the trial teaching, and then conduct in-depth special scientific research based on actual conditions. The third year will involve further trial teaching and revisions, striving to reach the level of textbooks in the end.

The teachers of the Department of Trade Economics of the institute have already formulated specific plans for compiling textbooks. They will conduct investigations and research in financial and economic leading departments and enterprises in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places. They are also preparing to revise the textbook "Commodity Science," which they compiled last year, and strive to publish it formally next year.

    东北财经学院组织师资力量编写教材
    新华社沈阳11日电　东北财经学院已经把组织师资力量编写适用的教材，作为近两三年内科学研究的重点。
    东北财经学院过去在学习苏联采用苏联教材时，虽然不断注意联系中国实际，但是对中国的实际情况讲的不多，不全面，不系统。学院要求这次编写教材要深入实际，有系统地整理、分析我国财经建设工作的成就和经验。一般做到第一年写出初稿，第二年试教，在试教中发现问题再深入实际进行专题科学研究，第三年再试教、修改，争取最后达到教科书水平。
    学院贸易经济系的教师们已经订出编写教材的具体方案，他们将要到北京、上海、天津等地财经领导部门和企业进行调查研究；并且准备修改他们去年已经编好的教材——“商品学”，争取明年正式出版。
