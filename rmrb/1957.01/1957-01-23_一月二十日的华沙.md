Warsaw Dispatch

    Warsaw on January 20th
    By Our Correspondent Hu Sisheng
    January 20th in Warsaw was like any other day. The morning was quiet and filled with a light mist. The sound of the first trams clattering along the streets brought the city of a million people its usual initial hustle and bustle. However, today was the day of the Polish parliamentary elections, and like many Warsaw citizens, I couldn't sleep past five o'clock.
    In the past few days, nearly a hundred journalists from bourgeois newspapers had arrived in Warsaw. England, America, and France each sent more than a dozen, and even Belgium, Denmark, Japan, and Canada sent reporters. My impression from being out and about these past few days is that the pre-election struggle was unusual. Some reactionaries were using the election rule that there were more candidates on the ballot than there were seats in parliament to incite people to cross out the names of United Workers' Party members when voting, in an attempt to make the Communists a minority in the future parliament. The Polish United Workers' Party gave this conspiracy a powerful counterattack, calling on voters not to cross out any candidates when voting, to ensure that all candidates of the National Unity Front would be elected. At this time, the Polish United Workers' Party revoked Oskar Lange's qualifications as a party candidate for parliament, because in his pre-election speech, he divided the United Workers' Party into two factions, and the harmfulness of this kind of activity that split the party at a tense moment in the election struggle was very obvious. It seemed some Western journalists were still looking for something else.
    Unsurprisingly, these people took action before election day even arrived. A Polish colleague told me that the British "Daily Express" reporter Smith's first dispatch after arriving in Warsaw said that on the eve of the election, a mayor in Lublin was beaten to death by the masses, and riots and chaos occurred in the city of Lodz. This was a complete fabrication. My Polish colleague sarcastically said, "This is only his first report since arriving here; perhaps in the next report, he will write that a sow in Kasalin gave birth to three calves, fifty cities in western Poland caught fire, and in Warsaw, Mr. Smith himself fortunately was not beaten to death by the masses, so he could continue to daydream. But we should thank Mr. Smith, as he has reminded people to pay attention to the possibility of reactionaries causing trouble during the election and has very appropriately revealed the reporting requirements of his superiors."
    At a little after eight o'clock in the morning, I rushed to polling station number 348 on Francuska Street. The entrance to the polling station was very quiet, with people entering and leaving in succession. I followed the voters into the polling room. This was a rectangular room of about thirty square meters. The furnishings inside were very simple. Polish flags were hung on both sides of the walls. Near the entrance was a long table covered with a blue tablecloth, with members of the election committee sitting beside it. Diagonally opposite the long table were two private rooms made of curtains for voters to use when voting. Voters had the right to cross out candidates they did not agree with. The ballot box was placed in the center of the room, surrounded by several pots of flowers. Each voter, after presenting their identification to the election committee, received a ballot. The ballot for this constituency had nine candidates, and six members of parliament were to be elected. According to the regulations, if a voter did not cross out any candidate names and put the ballot into the ballot box, the top six would be elected. This is what the party called on voters to do. These top six were the list negotiated by the National Unity Front, in which United Workers' Party members accounted for a little over half. I chatted with the staff at the polling station, and they said that the polling station opened at six o'clock in the morning, and some people were already waiting at the door at five o'clock. Most voters did not cross out any candidates and put the ballots directly into the box. He finally said that Comrade Gomulka was also voting here and would be arriving soon. Sure enough, at a little after nine o'clock, Comrade Gomulka entered to everyone's applause. He was dressed very simply, and his sparse, silvery-white hair was neatly combed. Everyone said he had walked to the polling station. Comrade Gomulka presented his identification and put his ballot into the ballot box. When he walked out the door, more and more people surrounded him, singing the Polish folk song "May he live among us for a hundred years." I had seen this scene more than once. At meetings where Comrade Gomulka met with voters, wherever Comrade Gomulka appeared, the masses welcomed him so enthusiastically. Comrade Gomulka enjoys a very high prestige among the masses and is a sign that the Polish United Workers' Party has the support of the masses.
    Next, we, the Chinese and Czechoslovakian journalists, rushed to the 358th constituency. Most of the voters here were workers from the automobile factory, and the polling station was just as quiet and orderly. The head of the election committee told us that the first person to vote at this polling station was the female worker Andrzejewska. After visiting this polling station, we rushed to the 363rd polling station in the suburban countryside to visit. Most of the voters here also put their ballots into the ballot box without making any changes. On the way back to the city, everyone chatted about the election. It was said that yesterday evening until this morning, workers and students organized pickets to patrol the various districts and near the polling stations to prevent anyone from engaging in provocations. Everyone also heard about the ban on selling alcohol on the 19th and 20th. At this time, the Czechoslovakian female journalist half-jokingly said, "When the election results are announced and the victory of socialist forces is once again confirmed, I'll treat everyone to a drink, and we must get drunk!"
    Back in the city, we went to the Polish Press Agency to learn about the national voting situation. We got some interesting figures and facts from the press agency: There were 17,499,000 voters nationwide, of which about 3.3 million were young people aged 18 to 25. The ratio of men to women among the voters was 100 to 108. By 9:00 am on the 20th, 10% of the voters nationwide had already voted, most of whom were women, because after voting early, they had to go home to take care of household chores and prepare lunch. In addition, there were many priests among the early voters. Most of them went directly to church after voting, because today is Sunday. The following news also attracted our attention: The first Poles to vote were sailors. At midnight on the 20th, Polish sailors on the Polish ship "Lewa," which was passing through Alexandria, Egypt, had all voted. In Lodz, Poles who had just been repatriated from the Soviet Union voted for the first time on their own soil. Ukrainian voters in the east also voted in favor of the candidates of the Polish National Unity Front. The head of the Polish Press Agency also told us that from the available materials, it could be expected that the vast majority of voters enthusiastically participated in the voting, and so far, most of the ballots cast had not been altered. At this time, I couldn't help but think of the British commentator's prediction of the Polish general election on the eve of the election. This British commentator predicted that the first possibility in the election was that most people would abstain; the second possibility was that most votes would be invalid; and the third possibility was that voters would cross out most of the candidates. Of course, estimating the possibilities that may exist in the future is always allowed, but if this estimate is not based on the largest and most extensive facts, it is inevitable that there will be some problems.
    In the afternoon, when I returned to my residence, a Polish comrade told me that some reactionary leaflets had appeared in Warsaw today, inciting people to cross out the United Workers' Party candidates on the ballots; some people also called the police station to say that the order was chaotic somewhere, but when the police arrived, they found that everything was actually peaceful. The countercurrent exists, although it always cannot resist the general trend.
    At 10:00 pm on the 20th, all 15,443 polling stations in Poland's 116 constituencies closed their ballot boxes after being open for sixteen hours. The final official results will not be revealed until the 23rd. But the overall situation is already set, and any political realist can easily see this.
    Among Western journalists, no matter what predictions some people have made or what feelings they have about the election results, they cannot help but bow to the facts. The Associated Press reported that the election "gave Gomulka and the hope he represents an overwhelming and clear support," and "this huge response" from voters "was achieved without direct pressure and without crude tactics." If one cannot help but admit this, then one must admit that the United States' propaganda through "Radio Free Europe" to incite, provoke, and sabotage the election has ended in a shameful failure.
    January 20th will be recorded in Polish history as the day the Polish people expressed their support for socialism and the United Workers' Party. Warsaw on January 20th, a peaceful and orderly Warsaw, a Warsaw where voters actively participated in the voting, was filled with a victorious political atmosphere.

    一月二十日的华沙
    本报记者　胡思升
    华沙的1月20日，同其他日子一样，清晨是宁静的，弥漫着薄雾，第一批电车在街上轧轧行驶的声音照例给这个百万人口的城市带来了初次的喧哗。但是，今天是波兰议会选举的日子，像不少华沙的市民一样，我在五时许就不能入睡了。
    在这几天里，近一百名资产阶级报刊的记者来到了华沙。英、美、法三国各来了十几名，连比利时、丹麦、日本和加拿大都派来了记者。这几天我在外面活动得来的印象是，选举前夕的斗争是不平常的。一些反动分子利用在选票上候选人多于议员名额的选举规定，煽动人们在投票时把统一工人党党员的名字勾去。企图使共产党人在未来的议会中居于少数的地位。波兰统一工人党给了这个阴谋以有力的回击，它号召选民在投票时不要划去候选人，以保证全国统一阵线的候选人全部当选。在这时，波兰统一工人党撤销了奥索布卡—摩拉夫斯基作为党的议员候选人资格，因为他在选举前的演说中把统一工人党内分为两派，这种在选举斗争紧张时刻分裂党的活动的有害性是十分显然的。看来某些西方记者似乎还在寻求什么别的东西。
    不出所料，选举日还没有到来，这些人就行动起来了。一位波兰同行告诉我，英国“每日快报”记者斯密特到华沙后发出的第一篇通讯就说，在选举前夕卢布林市的一位市长被群众打死了，罗兹城市内发生了骚动和混乱。这是漫天大谎。我的波兰同行讽刺地说：“这仅仅是他来此地后的第一篇报道，也许，下一篇报道，他就要写卡萨林市的母猪生了三头小牛，波兰西部有五十个城市失火，而在华沙，斯密特先生本人幸而没有被群众打死，因而还有可能大做其白日梦呢。但是，应该感谢斯密特先生，他既提醒了人们要注意选举时反动分子滋事生非的可能性，又十分恰当地把他们上司的报道要求和盘托出来了。”
    上午八点多钟，我赶到法兰西街第三百四十八号选举站。选举站门口十分安静，陆续有人在门口进出。我随着选民走进了投票室。这是一间面积约三十平方公尺的长方形屋子，屋内的陈设十分朴素，两边墙壁上挂着波兰国旗，靠门口放着一张铺有蓝色桌布的长桌，桌旁坐着选举委员会的人员。长桌斜对面是两间用幕布搭成的密室，供选民投票时使用，选民有权把他所不同意的候选人划去。投票箱放在屋子中央，周围放着几盆花。每一个选民进来向选举委员会呈验证件后，就拿到一张选票。这个选区的选票上有九个候选人，应该选出六个议员，如果不划去候选人名字而将选票投入选票箱，那末，按照规定前六名就要当选。这就是党号召选民这样做的。这前六名就是全国统一阵线协商好的名单，其中统一工人党人占二分之一强。我跟选举站的工作人员聊起天来，他说，投票站是清晨六时开放的，五点多钟就已经有人在门口等候了，大多数选民都是没有划去候选人而直接把选票投进箱内的。他最后说，哥穆尔卡同志也在这里投票，他快要来了。果然，九点多钟，在大家鼓掌欢迎下，哥穆尔卡同志带着微笑进来了。他的衣着很朴素，稀疏的银白色头发梳的很整齐，大家都说他是步行来投票的。哥穆尔卡同志呈验了证件，把选票投进了选票箱。当他走出门口时，越来越多的群众围住了他，唱起“让他在我们中间生活一百年”这首波兰民歌。这种场面，我看见不止一次了，在哥穆尔卡同志同选民会见的集会上，在哥穆尔卡同志出现的地方，群众都是这样热情的欢迎他。哥穆尔卡同志在群众中享有很高的威信，是波兰统一工人党得到群众拥护的一个标志。
    接着，我们，中国和捷克斯洛伐克记者又赶到第三百五十八号选区，这里的选民大都是汽车工厂的工人，选举站也是同样的安静和有秩序。选举委员会负责人告诉我们，这个选举站第一个投票的是女工安哲夫斯卡。参观完这个选举站后，我们又赶到郊区农民的第三百六十三号选举站去参观，这里大部分选民也都是把选票不加涂改地投入选举箱。从这里回市区的路上，大家围绕着选举闲谈起来，听说，昨天晚上到今天清晨，工人和学生组织了纠察队在各区和选举站附近巡逻，以防万一有人进行挑衅。关于19日和20日两天禁止售酒的禁令大家也听说了。这时捷克斯洛伐克女记者半开玩笑地说：“等选举结果公布，再一次确定社会主义力量获得胜利，我请大家一起喝酒，一定要喝醉才罢！”
    回到市区，我们又去波兰通讯社了解全国投票的情况。我们从通讯社那里得到了一些有趣的数字和事实：全国选民有一千七百四十九万九千人，其中约三百三十万是十八岁到二十五岁的青年，在选民中男与女的比例是一百比一百零八。到20日上午九点钟为止，全国已有10％的选民投了票，其中多数是妇女。因为她们早一些投完票后，还要回家料理家务和准备午饭。此外，在早投票的选民中神甫也不少，他们大多数投完票后就直接上教堂去了，因为今天是礼拜天。下面这样的消息也吸引了我们的注意，波兰人中最早投票的是海员。20日零时，行经埃及亚历山大港的波兰船只“来瓦号”上的波兰水手，都投完了票。在罗兹，刚从苏联遣返回来的波兰人第一次在自己国土上投了票。东部的乌克兰选民也投票赞成波兰全国统一阵线的候选人。波兰通讯社的负责人还告诉我们，从现有材料可以预计，绝大多数选民踊跃参加了投票，而到目前为止，投票的人当中大多数选票都没有涂改。这时，我不禁想起选举前夕英国的评论员对波兰大选的预测，这位英国评论员预测选举时出现的第一种可能是，大多数人弃权；第二种可能是，多数票成为废票；第三种可能是，选民把大部候选人划去。当然，估计将来存在那些可能性的做法总是容许的，但是，如果这种估计不根据最大量最广泛的事实的话，是难免不出点毛病的。
    下午回到住所，一位波兰同志告诉我，今天在华沙市内出现了一些反动传单，煽动人们划去选票上的统一工人党的候选人；也有人打电话到警察局说什么地方秩序混乱，但警察赶到一看，实际上平静无事。逆流是存在的，虽然它总是抵挡不住大势所趋的潮流。
    20日晚上十点钟，波兰全国一百一十六个选区中的一万五千四百四十三个选举站在开放了十六个小时后，都把投票箱封闭了起来。官方的最后结果要到23日才能最后揭晓。但是大局是已经定了，只要是政治上的现实主义者，都是不难看到这一点的。
    在西方记者中，不管有人作过怎样的预测，对选举结果抱着什么心情，但想不向事实低头是办不到的。美联社报道说，选举“给了哥穆尔卡和他所代表的希望以压倒多数的清醒的支持”，而来自选民们的“这种巨大的响应，是在没有直接的压力和没有粗暴的策略下实现的”。如果不能不承认这一点，那就必须承认：美国通过“自由欧洲电台”进行的煽动、挑拨和破坏选举的宣传，已落得可耻的收场。
    1月20日将以波兰人民表示拥护社会主义支持统一工人党的日子记载在波兰的历史上。1月20日的华沙，平静而有秩序的华沙，选民积极参加投票的华沙，充满了胜利的政治气氛。
