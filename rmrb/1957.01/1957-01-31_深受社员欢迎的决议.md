    A resolution deeply welcomed by commune members
    The "August 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in Baonan Township, Pucheng County, Shaanxi Province, recently passed a resolution deeply welcomed by commune members – to let commune members happily celebrate the Spring Festival. The resolution proposed: the cooperative's tofu and vermicelli workshops will supply each person with four liang of vermicelli and one jin and four liang of tofu. Commune members who have soybeans will hand them over; those who don't will have the cost deducted during the autumn harvest distribution. The cooperative plans to slaughter four pigs, supplying each person with half a jin of meat. It will also use eight dou of soft millet and buy some dates to steam into crystal cakes for commune members to use when visiting relatives. In addition, to enable commune members to have money to buy green vegetables and New Year goods, the cooperative decided to advance a portion of the income from sideline occupations.
    Commune members said excitedly: The cooperative has thought so thoroughly, not only letting everyone have a happy festival, but also saving a lot of money. (Jing Quancheng)

    深受社员欢迎的决议
    陕西蒲城县保南乡八一农业社，最近通过了一个深受社员欢迎的决议——让社员欢欢乐乐地过春节。决议中提出：由社里的豆腐坊和粉坊，供给每人四两粉条、一斤四两豆腐，有豆子的社员交豆子，没有的到今年秋收分配的时候再扣；社里计划杀四口猪，供给每人半斤肉；还用八斗软糜子，再买些枣子，蒸成晶糕，供给社员走亲戚之用；另外，为使社员有钱买青菜、年货，社里决定从副业收入中预支一部分。
    社员们都兴奋地说：社里想得真周到，不光让大家快快乐乐过个节，还可以节省很多钱。（井全成）
