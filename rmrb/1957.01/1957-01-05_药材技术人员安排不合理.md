    Irrational Arrangement of Pharmaceutical Technicians
    In Chongqing, Sichuan Province, and other places, some capitalist personnel and shop assistants with pharmaceutical management skills and techniques were recruited to work last year. Most of these people were later absorbed as state cadres. However, some special districts in Sichuan Province have not made rational use of these technicians. The Xichang Special District Cooperative Office assigned personnel with rich experience and skills in pharmaceutical management to district cooperatives or distribution stores through the county supply and marketing cooperatives to engage in other businesses. For example, Kang Mengguang was transferred to Huilong Township in Mianning County to sell general merchandise; Zhou Yihe was transferred to a production materials station to work as an accountant; Shen Shouzhen was transferred to engage in waste product recycling; and Li Shuren was transferred to the Yanbian County Cooperative to do administrative work. Wu Yukun, who had decades of experience in pharmaceutical management, was assigned to the retail department of the Luzhou Special District Native Products Station to issue invoices after being transferred to Luzhou Special District.

    Another situation of not paying attention to the rational use of pharmaceutical personnel is that when the leadership relationship of the traditional Chinese medicine management department changes, the leadership departments in some areas only transfer the pharmaceutical business but "withhold" or transfer fewer pharmaceutical cadres. For example, when the Xichang Trading Company transferred the pharmaceutical business to the local traditional Chinese medicine wholesale station in June last year, it assigned Liu Yuquan and Bian Shifu, who were originally drugstore clerks, possessed pharmaceutical skills, and had great interest in pharmaceutical work, to sell coarse cloth. Nanxi County in Yibin Special District also transferred two pharmaceutical personnel to do other work.

    I suggest that relevant leading departments promptly check and correct this irrational situation and transfer them back to pharmaceutical work positions to give full play to their technical knowledge and experience to serve the health care of the broad masses of people.

### 药材技术人员安排不合理

    药材技术人员安排不合理
    四川省重庆市等地，去年曾吸收了部分有经营药材技术的资方人员和店员参加工作。这些人后来绝大部分被吸收作为国家干部。可是，四川省有些专区却没有合理地使用这些技术人员。西昌专区合作社办事处，把有丰富经营药材经验和技术的人员，通过县供销合作社分到区社、或分销店去干其他业务了。如把康孟光调到冕宁县回龙乡去卖百货；把周义和调到一个生产资料站中去作会计；把沈守贞调去搞废品收购业务；把李树仁调到盐边县合作社去作事务工作。吴玉琨有几十年经营药材的经验，调到泸州专区后，便被分配在泸州专区土产站门市部干开发票工作。
    不重视合理使用药材人员的另一情况，是当中药材经营部门的领导关系变换的时候，部分地区的领导部门只移交药材叶务，而“扣留”或少交药材干部。如西昌贸易公司，去年6月把药材业务移交给当地中药材批发站的时候，把原是药铺店员、有药材技术、对药材工作有很大兴趣的刘玉泉、边仕富两人，分配去做卖土布的工作。宜宾专区南溪县，也曾把两个药材人员调去干别的工作。
    我建议有关领导部门及时检查纠正这种不合理情况，把他们调回药材工作岗位上来，以发挥他们的技术知识和经验，为广大人民的保健事业服务。
