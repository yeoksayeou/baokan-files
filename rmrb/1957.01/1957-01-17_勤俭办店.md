    Running a Shop Thriftily
    In Nanjing, there is a Xin Xin Department Store Cooperative, which was established in June 1956 by four individual peddlers of general merchandise. At that time, they only had over 580 yuan in capital, of which over 220 yuan was in slow-moving goods. In the first month after opening, their income and expenditure barely balanced. Wang Weiwen, one of the members of the shop, wavered and withdrew to work individually. The remaining three, Xue Ruyu, Wang Yuehua, and Feng Chenggu, did not lose heart and persevered in running the shop thriftily. They maintained the characteristics of opening early and closing late, which they had when they were stall vendors, to serve customers' convenience. They frequently learned about customers' needs, actively purchased various commodities, and proactively delivered goods to customers' doors. For example, once, a cement products factory needed dozens of pairs of coarse white cotton gloves, and they delivered the gloves to the factory. They also paid attention to careful calculation and economizing on expenses. Thanks to their thrifty management and the support of national loans, the variety of goods sold by this small shop has increased from more than 400 to more than 600, and the monthly turnover has risen from the initial 1,000 yuan to more than 3,000 yuan. The income of the employees has increased by nearly double compared to the initial organizational period.
    Do not underestimate this small shop; it is indeed worthy of learning from in terms of thrifty management by many shops (including those large public-private joint ventures and state-owned shops). Currently, many shops have failed to diligently serve customers and carefully economize on expenses. If the employees of these shops could think about what they should do in terms of "diligence" and what they should do in terms of "thrift," it would not be superfluous.

    勤俭办店
    南京市有一座新新百货合作商店，是1956年6月间由四户百货摊贩组织起来的。当时只有资金五百八十多元，其中有二百二十多元是滞销商品。开张的第一个月，收支勉强平衡。商店的成员之一王蔚文动摇了，退出去单干。剩下的薛如玉、王月华、冯成谷三个人没有灰心，克勤克俭，把商店坚持办下来了。他们保持了摆摊子时开业早、闭店迟的特点，便利顾客。他们经常了解顾客的需要，积极采办各种商品，主动送货上门。如有一次，一家水泥制品厂需要几十打粗白纱手套，他们就把手套送到工厂。他们也注意精打细算，节约开支。由于勤俭经营和国家贷款的支持，这个小商店的经营品种已由四百多种增加到六百多种，每月营业额由最初的一千多元上升到三千多元，从业人员的收入比开始组织时期增加将近一倍。
    大家不要小看这个小小的商店，它在勤俭经营这方面，的确值得很多商店（包括那些门面很大的公私合营商店和国营商店在内）学习。现在有不少商店，没有做到殷勤地为顾客服务，精打细算地节约开支。如果这些商店的从业人员能够想一想在“勤”的方面，应该做些什么，在“俭”的方面应该做些什么，这决不是多余的。
