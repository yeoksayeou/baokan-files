Visiting the Institute of Chinese Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences
By Our Correspondent Li He

The Institute of Chinese Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences was established not long ago. This event reflects the growth of Sino-Soviet friendship and the increasing interest of the Soviet people in China. On January 24th, this reporter visited Comrade Belevil Tello, the director of the institute. He had served as an advisor to the magazine "People's China" in our country for three years, and he warmly introduced the institute's overview and prospects. He said that his surname could be written in a Chinese way as Tai Luo.

Before last year, the scientific research on Chinese issues in the Soviet Union was concentrated in a research office of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Later, according to the decision of the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, an independent scientific center for studying Chinese issues was established. Comrade Tello talked about the three reasons for establishing this institute: First, after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet people's interest in China's history, philosophy, ancient relics, literature, and socialist construction has greatly increased. Almost every week, a new book about China is published, and in recent years, about 120 degree theses have been researched on Chinese issues. Secondly, without carefully studying Chinese history, philosophy, economics, and literature, it is impossible to clearly understand many issues in world history. Thirdly, the experience of the Chinese people's struggle and construction under the leadership of the Communist Party has creatively applied Marxism-Leninism, which has great theoretical significance. The newly established Institute of Chinese Studies is divided into departments of history, economics, national construction, ethnic languages, literature, and culture, with a total of one hundred scientific researchers, 70% of whom are young people. They can all freely read modern Chinese books, but there are not many people who understand classical Chinese.

To commemorate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, the institute will publish "A General History of the People's Republic of China," which will discuss the basic achievements of New China and the main experiences of construction and transformation. "A History of Sino-Soviet Relations" will also be published. As for the institute's long-term plans, there is only an outline at present. Comrade Tello said: In terms of history, it is expected that a general history of modern China from the May Fourth Movement of 1919 to 1949 can be completed this year. In addition, preparations are being made to study ancient Chinese history, medieval history, and modern history up to 1919. Preparations are being made to study the history of Chinese social and political thought, and to compile historical materials on Sino-Soviet relations from the 17th to the 19th centuries. In terms of language, a four-volume "Chinese-Russian Dictionary" and a Chinese grammar urgently needed by learners of Chinese will be compiled, and the languages of various ethnic groups in China will be studied. In terms of literature and culture, the Book of Songs, Du Fu and Tao Yuanming's poetry collections, as well as poetry collections of several new poets since the May Fourth Movement, will be translated and introduced; Records of the Grand Historian, Zhuangzi, Guanzi, and Sun Tzu will be translated and introduced. Preparations will be made to study an outline of Chinese literature since the May Fourth Movement, a collection of documents on cultural revolution issues of the People's Republic of China will be compiled, and historical materials on ancient Chinese relics will also be studied.

Comrade Tello believes that extensive cooperation between Chinese and Soviet scientists will be of great help to the work of this institute. He said: We will soon send the proofs of the general history of modern China to China and ask Chinese comrades for their opinions. In the future, when editing dictionaries and historical materials, the help of Chinese scientists will also be needed. We plan to hire some Chinese experts to participate in the work of the institute and send graduate students to China for further study.

    访苏联科学院中国问题研究所
    本报记者　李何
    苏联科学院中国问题研究所在不久以前诞生了。这件事反映了中苏友谊和苏联人民对中国兴趣的增长。记者在1月24日访问了这个研究所的所长白列维尔·泰洛同志。他曾经在我国当了三年“人民中国”杂志的顾问，他热情地介绍了研究所的概况和前景。他说，可以把他的姓中国化地写成泰洛。
    在去年以前，苏联对于中国问题的科学研究是集中在苏联科学院东方学研究所的一个研究室里进行的。后来，根据苏联科学院主席团的决定，建立了研究中国问题的独立的科学中心。泰洛同志谈到了建立这个研究所的三个原因：第一、在中华人民共和国建立以后，苏联人民对于中国的历史、哲学、古代文物、文学、社会主义建设各方面的兴趣大大增长，差不多每个星期都有关于中国的新书出版，这几年中约有一百二十篇考取了学位的论文是研究中国问题的。其次，不仔细地研究中国历史、哲学、经济、文学，就不能够明确地了解世界历史的许多问题。再次，在共产党领导下的中国人民的斗争和建设经验，创造性地运用了马克思列宁主义，这具有巨大的理论意义。新建立的中国问题研究所分历史、经济、国家建设、各族语言、文学和文化等室，总共有一百个科学研究人员，其中70％是青年。他们都能自由地阅读现代的中文书籍，只是懂中国古文的人员还不多。
    为着纪念十月革命四十周年，研究所将出版“中华人民共和国历史概论”，这本书将论述新中国的基本成就和建设与改造的主要经验。还将出版“中苏关系史”。至于研究所的远景计划，现在只有一个轮廓。泰洛同志说：在历史方面，预计在今年可以完成从1919年“五四”运动到1949年的中国现代史概论。此外，准备研究中国上古史、中古史和到1919年为止的近代史，准备研究中国社会政治思想史，编纂如像十七世纪到十九世纪的中苏关系的史料。在语言方面，将编纂四卷的“华俄大辞典”和为学习汉文者所急需的汉语文法，并将研究中国各民族的语言。在文学和文化方面，将翻译和介绍诗经、杜甫和陶渊明的诗集以及“五四”以来几个新诗诗人的诗集；将翻译和介绍史记、庄子、管子、孙子，准备研究“五四”以来的中国文学概要，将编纂中华人民共和国文化革命问题文集，还准备研究中国古代文物的史料。
    泰洛同志认为，中苏两国科学工作者的广泛合作，对于这个研究所的工作将有很大的帮助。他说：我们最近将把中国现代史概论的清样送到中国，请中国同志提意见。将来编辑辞典和史料的时候，也需要中国科学工作者的帮助。我们将打算聘请若干中国专家参加研究所工作和派遣研究生到中国去深造。
