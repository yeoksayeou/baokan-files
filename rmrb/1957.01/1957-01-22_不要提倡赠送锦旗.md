    Don't Advocate Giving Banners

    To the Editor:
    I work in rural areas. In the countryside, whenever an agricultural cooperative, a rural credit cooperative, or a supply and marketing cooperative is established, the township people's committee, the Party, the Communist Youth League branch, the women's federation, and some agricultural cooperatives give banners to express congratulations. As a result, these cooperatives' walls are covered with red and green banners of various sizes. Some cooperatives don't have enough wall space, so they hang them on bamboo poles by the roadside. I think many such organizations will be established in rural areas. If they all imitate each other in giving banners, it will cause a large waste of silk cloth and money. This trend should not be advocated.

### 不要提倡赠送锦旗

    不要提倡赠送锦旗编辑同志：
    我是做农村工作的，在农村里，每当农业社、乡信用社、供销社成立时，乡人民委员会、党、团支部、妇女会和一些农业社都要送锦旗表示祝贺。于是，这些社的墙壁上挂满了红绿颜色、大小不一的锦旗，有的社里挂不下，就用竹竿挑起挂在路旁。我认为农村里要成立很多这样的组织，如果都互相模仿送锦旗，会造成绸布和金钱大量的浪费，这种风气是不应该提倡的。
