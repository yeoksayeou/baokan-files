    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: French Prime Minister Mollet issued a "Declaration of Intent" on the Algerian issue on January 9th, stating that France would "never abandon Algeria."

    The declaration stated that Algeria's status should be determined through negotiations between the French government and representatives of the Arab residents and European residents elected according to Algeria's "free elections." Mollet once again put forward the so-called suggestion of a ceasefire in Algeria "without any prior political conditions." The prior political conditions he refers to are the Algerian people's demands for national independence.

    In this "Declaration," Mollet attempted to prove that the United Nations had "no right to handle" the Algerian issue. He said that this was a matter "only within" France's "own scope of authority."

    This statement has been opposed by the Algerian public. For example, representatives of the Algerian National Liberation Front announced on January 11th that France must first recognize Algeria's independence before a ceasefire can be achieved; otherwise, the Algerian people will continue to fight for national independence.

    The "Algerian National Liberation Front" also called on all Algerians (including those living in France) to hold an eight-day general strike and general business shutdown while the United Nations discusses the Algerian issue.

    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线看穿摩勒的木马计
    坚持取得自决后才能停火
    号召全体人民举行总罢工总罢市
    据新华社讯　法国总理摩勒9日发表了法国政府关于阿尔及利亚问题的“意图宣言”，表示“决不放弃阿尔及利亚”。
    这个宣言说，阿尔及利亚的地位应当通过法国政府同根据阿尔及利亚的“自由选举”所选出的阿拉伯居民代表和欧洲籍居民代表的谈判来确定。摩勒再次提出所谓“不附任何先决政治条件”而在阿尔及利亚实行停火的建议。他这里所指的先决政治条件就是阿尔及利亚人民关于民族独立的要求。
    摩勒在这个“宣言”里企图证明联合国“无权处理”阿尔及利亚问题。他说，这是“只属于”法国“本国的权限范围以内”的事。
    这个声明遭到了阿尔及利亚公众的反对。例如，阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的代表11日宣布，法国必须首先承认阿尔及利亚的独立，才可能实现停火；否则，阿尔及利亚人民将继续为民族独立而战斗。
    “阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线”并且号召全体阿尔及利亚人（包括住在法国的），在联合国讨论阿尔及利亚问题的时候举行八天的总罢工和总罢市。
