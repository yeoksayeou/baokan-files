Saving Over 300,000 Kilowatt-Hours of Electricity
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 7th: The Tianjin No. 4 State-Owned Cotton Textile Factory saved over 300,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity in the past year, enough to spin more than 1,480 bales of yarn.
The Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory greatly reduced its electricity consumption by organizing electricity-saving groups, promoting advanced experience, and adjusting transformers. In the past, the spindle tapes driving the spindles on the spinning machines were woven from cotton yarn, which was thick and hard and had poor running efficiency. To maintain the quality of the fine yarn, it was necessary to increase the running speed, which increased electricity consumption. Later, based on the experience of the Qingdao Cotton Textile Factory, the factory changed the cotton yarn spindle tapes to thinner and softer hemp spindle tapes, which improved running efficiency and reduced electricity consumption by 10%. In addition, the fine yarn workshop promoted the Soviet experience of adding oleic acid to the fine yarn spindle oil to reduce friction during machine operation, reducing electricity consumption per bale of yarn by 4.37 kilowatt-hours compared to the plan, and reducing machine wear. The weaving workshop also promoted experiences such as periodic oiling of looms and applying tung oil to shuttles, reducing electricity consumption per 1,000 meters of cloth by 3.58%.

Using Old and Discarded Equipment to Build a Workshop
Xinhua News Agency, Hefei: A coarse yarn workshop built by the Wuhu Textile Factory in Anhui using old and discarded equipment has recently gone into production. The machines installed in this workshop, except for five new ones, the remaining one or two dozen, some were burned in factory fires in the past, and some were picked up from scrap piles in other factories. Some of the carding machines installed here were modified by workers using British-made machine bodies and American-made parts. All the steel wire needle cloth on the carding machines would have cost seven or eight thousand yuan to buy new, but the purchasing staff only spent more than one hundred yuan to buy this batch of old materials from a factory in Shanghai. This coarse yarn workshop, which can spin more than one hundred bales of yarn per month, cost only more than thirty thousand yuan for all basic construction, including the value of several new machines. To build such a workshop from scratch, the cost of purchasing machines alone would be 180,000 yuan.
The raw materials for production in this workshop are 73% made up of broken seed cotton, knife-cut cotton, waste cotton, and reclaimed cotton that can no longer be used to spin fine yarn. In the past, most of these cottons were sold as waste materials at low prices. With this coarse spinning workshop, the tens of thousands of kilograms of reclaimed cotton from the entire factory each year can be mixed with raw cotton and spun into various coarse yarns of 10 counts or less after processes such as impurity separation and cleaning, which are used to weave work gloves, cotton socks, and the like.

Turning Damaged Equipment into Useful Materials
The processing group of the Chongqing Waste Recycling Station of the Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has picked out many old materials from waste piles since February of last year, and has installed a jeep, a large truck, more than ninety platform trucks, thirty telephones, four radios, and nine motors, and repaired more than six hundred and thirty tires. They repair, patch, and piece together all day long, turning damaged equipment into useful materials. By the end of last year, they had created more than 300,000 yuan in wealth for the people.
Recently, Li Weilian, a young advanced worker in this group, has successfully researched the use of waste batteries to process nine kinds of industrial raw materials such as ammonium chloride, manganese dioxide, carbon powder, paraffin, plastic, zinc, and copper. Waste batteries, which were worthless, are worth more than 200 yuan per ton after processing. They calculated that several hundred tons of batteries are sold in Chongqing every month. If 50% of the used waste batteries can be recycled for processing, then more than 700,000 yuan of wealth can be picked out of the waste pile in a year.

Mass Savings Station on the Construction Site
Xinhua News Agency: A "Mass Savings Station" set up by the workers themselves has appeared on the construction site of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant. Workers on the construction site send any scrap iron, screws, nails, rebar ends, etc. that they pick up to the station, so that even the slightest waste on the construction site is reduced.
The "Mass Savings Station" was established in mid-November last year by the workers of the Second Mixed Work Section of the 104th Work Zone of this construction site. They used a large wooden box and placed it next to the road leading into and out of the construction site, so that everyone can see it and it is convenient to drop off the things they pick up. In a very short period of time, the workers of Niu Zongxiang's and Hu Qingshan's groups in this work section picked up 359 kilograms of rebar ends, screws, safety helmets, and nails. They received awards from the leaders of the work zone when they turned in these items.

More Than 200 Tons of Re-refined Oil
Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, January 7th: The Qingdao City Company of the China Petroleum Corporation of Shandong Province recovered a total of 311.37 tons of various waste oils in 1956, and 211 tons have been processed and refined into various re-refined oils and used in industrial production, which is equivalent to increasing the country's wealth by more than 150,000 yuan at list prices.
Last year, the company successively purchased 98 tons of lubricating oil, which was processed into 40 tons of internal combustion engine oil to support the needs of the transportation industry and heavy industry in Qingdao; in the fourth quarter, 38 tons of waste gasoline, waste kerosene, and waste diesel oil were purchased, all of which had been used to wash machines, and the oil contained many impurities. The company's employees processed and refined industrial gasoline, lamp kerosene, light diesel oil, and heavy vehicle oil according to the composition of the waste oil. They also processed waste transformer oil into instrument oil, waste turbine oil into re-refined turbine oil, and processed more than 100 tons of deteriorated waste oil that had been accumulated in their warehouse for a long time into heavy diesel oil.
In addition to recovering waste oil in the city, the company also sent people to Yidu, Gaomi, Laiyang and other places to organize the recovery of waste oil; at the same time, it sent people to the processing plants to carry out technical guidance on the processing of re-refined oil, ensuring that the specifications and quality of various re-refined oils meet the standards.

Saving Nearly 190,000 Catties of Cotton
This newspaper reports: The staff and workers of the Nantong Dasheng No. 3 Factory saved nearly 190,000 catties of raw cotton for the country last year while ensuring quality. The average amount of cotton used per bale of yarn produced was five and a half catties lower than the national cotton allocation standard.
Starting in April last year, the factory further carried out education for employees on saving cotton on the basis of improving quality. They corrected the past tendency of unilaterally saving cotton without regard to quality, and at the same time paid attention to preventing the overuse of raw cotton in order to improve quality. Corresponding measures were also taken in raw cotton management and improving workers' operational skills. For example, the production technology section implemented methods such as not letting useful fibers fall off, and letting short fibers fall off when they should, so that the short lint loss rate was always maintained within 1.4%, which saved cotton and stabilized quality.
Through these efforts and education, employees have gradually developed saving habits. Last year, when new cotton was used, everyone thought of various ways to stabilize the amount of cotton used when it increased. Now, the quality of the factory's products is the first in the city, and the amount of cotton used is also the least in the city.

    大处着眼，小处着手，随时节约，随地节约
    节约电三十余万度
    据新华社天津7日电　国营天津第四棉纺织厂一年来节约了三十多万度电。用这些电足够纺一千四百八十多件纱。
    天津国棉四厂由于组织节电小组，推广先进经验，调整变压器，才使用电量大大降低。过去，这个工厂纺纱机上带动纱锭运转的锭带是用棉纱织成的，又厚又硬，运转功能不好，为了保持细纱质量必须加快运转速度，这样就增加了用电量。后来这个厂根据青岛棉纺织厂的经验，把棉纱织成的锭带改为又薄又软的麻锭带，提高了运转效能，可以使用电量减少10％。此外，细纱车间推广了苏联的在细纱锭子油中加油酸以减少机器运转时的磨擦等经验，使每件纱的用电量比计划减少四点三七度，机器的磨损也减少了。织布车间也推广了织布机周期加油和梭子打桐油等经验，使每织一千公尺布的耗电量减少了3.58％。
    用废旧设备建个车间
    据新华社合肥讯　安徽芜湖纺织厂利用废旧设备建立的一个粗纺车间，最近投入生产。这个车间安装的机器，除五台新的以外，其余一、二十台，有的是厂里过去受火灾烧毁的，有的是从外地工厂的废料堆里拣出来的。这里安装的梳棉机有的就是工人用英国货的机身配美国货的零件改装的。全部梳棉机上的钢丝针布，如果买新的需要七、八千元，而采购人员只用了一百多元钱，就在上海一家工厂里买来了这批旧料。这个每月可以纺一百多件纱的粗纱车间，连几台新机器的价值在内，全部基本建设费只用了三万多元。要是新建这样一个车间，光机器的购置费就需要十八万元。
    这个车间的生产原料有73％是用不能再纺细纱的破子花、斩刀花、下脚花和回花。这些棉花过去大多数是当作废料低价出售的。有了这个粗纺车间，全厂每年为数几万斤的回棉就可以经过杂质分离和清理等过程，同原棉混合纺成十支以下的各种粗纱，用来织成工作手套、棉袜等。
    残破器材变成有用物资
    四川省供销社重庆废品收购站的加工组，从去年2月份到现在，已经从废料堆中拣出许多旧材料，安装了一部吉普车、一部大卡车、九十多部板车、三十部电话机、四部收音机、九部马达，修补好六百三十多个轮胎。他们整天修修补补、拼拼凑凑，把残破器材变为有用的物资，到去年年底已为人民创造了三十多万元的财富。
    最近，这个组的青年先进工作者李维廉，又研究成功用废电池加工成氯化铵、二氧化锰、炭精粉、石蜡、塑料、锌、铜等九种工业原料。一文不值的废电池经过加工后，每吨价值二百多元。他们计算了一下，重庆市每月销售出去的电池有好几百吨，如果能够回收50％用过的废电池来加工，那么一年就可从废物堆中拣出七十多万元的财富。

    工地上的大众节约站
    据新华社讯　在第一拖拉机制造厂的建筑工地上，出现了一个由工人自己设立的“大众节约站”。工人们在工地上把随手拾到的碎铁片、螺丝、钉子、钢筋头等送到站里来，使工地上即使点滴浪费的现象也要减少。
      “大众节约站”是这个工地一零四工区第二混合工长室的工人在去年11月中旬设立的。他们用了一个大木箱子，放在出入施工现场的路旁，使人人都能见到，投送拾起来的东西也很方便。在很短的时间内，这个工长室的牛宗祥、胡清善两个小组的工人，就拾了钢筋头、螺丝、安全帽、钉子三百五十九公斤。在上缴这些东西的时候，他们得到了工区领导方面的奖励。
    再生油二百多吨
    新华社青岛7日电　中国石油公司山东省青岛市公司1956年共回收各种废油三百一十一点三七吨，有二百一十一吨已经加工提炼出各种再生油并用于工业生产，按牌价计算，等于为国家增加了十五万多元财富。
    这个公司去年曾经先后收购了九十八吨润滑油，经过加工制成了四十吨内燃机油，支援了青岛市交通运输业和重工业的需要；在第四季度收购的三十八吨废汽油、废煤油和废柴油，都是洗刷机器用过的，油里含有杂质很多。这个公司的职工们就根据废油的成分，分别加工提炼出工业汽油、灯用煤油、轻柴油和大车油等。他们还把收购的废变压器油加工提炼成仪器油，把废透平油加工提炼成再生透平油，把自己仓库里长期积压变质的一百多吨废油加工提炼成重柴油。
    这个公司除在本市回收废油以外，还派人到益都、高密、莱阳等地组织废油回收；同时又派人深入到加工厂中进行加工再生油的技术指导工作，保证了各种再生油的规格和质量合乎标准。
    省下近十九万斤棉花
    本报讯　南通市大生三厂职工，去年在保证质量的前提下，已为国家节约了原棉近十九万市斤。每生产一件纱，用棉量平均比国家配棉标准低五斤半。
    从去年4月份开始，这个厂对职工进一步开展了在提高质量的基础上节约用棉的教育，他们一面纠正过去不顾质量片面节约用棉的倾向，同时又注意防止为提高质量而多用原棉。在原棉管理和提高工人操作水平等方面也作了相应的措施。如生产技术科施行了有用纤维不使落掉，而短纤维当落则落等方法，使落短绒经常保持在1.4％以内，既节约了用棉，又稳定了质量。
    通过这些工作和教育，使职工们逐渐养成了节约习惯。去年使用新棉时，用棉量一有增加，大家就想出各种办法使它稳定下来。现在，该厂的产品质量是全市第一，用棉量也是全市最少的一个。
