Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 16th: According to a report by the Polish News Agency, Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, delivered a lengthy speech on January 14th at a meeting in Warsaw with parliamentary candidates and voters.

	Gomułka said: Despite the various difficulties at the present stage, we can and need to inspire the patriotism, mature thinking, and sense of responsibility of the people nationwide. Mass participation in the elections, massive voting in support of the National Unity Front, supporting its main candidates, supporting those who have contributed to the program of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, will show the world that the Polish people, under the leadership of the working class, are united and cohesive, and that they support the policies of sovereignty, socialism, and democracy.

	Gomułka continued by saying that the Eighth Plenary Session of our Party pointed out the road to building socialism in Poland. On this road, we are eliminating the mistakes of the past while utilizing the tremendous achievements of the People's Poland in many aspects of life under the leadership of our Party over the past twelve years.

	Polish-Soviet friendship has been further strengthened. The temporary stationing of Soviet troops in Poland meets the requirements of Polish border security.

	We have already adjusted our relations with the Soviet Union on the basis of equality and non-interference in internal affairs, on the basis of the socialist ideals that unite us with the Soviet Union, on the basis of common goals, and on the basis of international solidarity, alliance, and friendship. Polish-Soviet friendship has existed for a long time. It was born as the friendship between the Polish and Russian working classes in the common struggle against Tsarist rule, and later, during the war years against the Nazis and in the post-war years of jointly fighting for world peace, the common ideals of building a better and more just life further strengthened this friendship. The Soviet-Polish talks in Moscow in November 1956 eliminated the abnormalities in our bilateral relations, phenomena that were detrimental to this friendship, and laid a solid foundation for the further development and strengthening of the fraternal relations between our two peoples.

	Speaking of the temporary stationing of Soviet troops on Polish territory, Gomułka said that this is not only something we have agreed to, but first and foremost, it meets the requirements of our country's border security. The temporary stationing of Soviet troops in Poland is not a negative factor in Polish policy, but a positive one.

	The basic goal of the Party and the government is to improve the living conditions of the working people. The Party will never relinquish power to the reactionaries.

	Gomułka went on to say that, in our internal relations, we are unwaveringly implementing the socialist rule of law as stipulated by the Eighth Plenary Session. Despite the country's difficult financial situation, we have, to the extent possible, increased the wages of employees in some sectors.

	Gomułka said that we have just begun to embark on the road charted by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party. Many of the things we advocate still need to be tested and critically analyzed. Decisions still need to be made on many issues.

	The basic goal of the Party's leadership, the basic goal of the government, is to constantly and systematically do everything possible to improve the living conditions of the working people, while utilizing Poland's industrialization, improving our economy, and learning from past experiences. We do not make and will not make any rash guarantees, but will constantly and unremittingly implement what we have announced can be done. We produce as much as we have. If we rely on the labor of our hands and brains to increase production, reduce costs, and improve quality, we will have more. The Party and the government can assure you that they will do everything possible to ensure that the fruits of your labor are not wasted and that the fruits of your labor fully benefit the people nationwide.

	In the current domestic and international situation, this is the only policy, the only realistic program.

	Gomułka emphasized that this election is of particular importance. In this election, the people nationwide have a responsibility to declare whether they support or oppose the program formulated by the Eighth Plenary Session to reform our country's life. The expression of support for this program by the people nationwide is to create the premise for implementing this program.

	The revolutionary party of the working class, the Polish United Workers' Party, will never relinquish power to the reactionaries and those who would restore capitalism in Poland. We do not give it up because any other kind of regime would be a tragic disaster for Poland, and for the working class, for all the working people in urban and rural areas, any other kind of regime would be many times worse than the worst people's regime.

	Reactionary forces are using the expansion of democratization and freedom in social life to incite disturbances. The Polish people will never listen to the rumors and gossip of agitators.

	It can be seen very clearly from the election campaign process that all sorts of political dregs, irresponsible agitators, and troublemakers, along with openly and secretly active reactionaries who have raised their heads in the tide of democratization, are trying to influence the conduct of the election. One way these elements attack the people's regime is to call for a boycott of this election. They are using the expansion of democratization and freedom in social life, and taking advantage of the difficulties our country is facing today, to incite disturbances, spread chaos, and make it difficult for us to complete the task of overcoming current difficulties. The consistent attitude of the reactionary forces toward People's Poland can be summed up in one sentence: the worse, the better. They secretly instigate voters to cross out all the names on the ballot. They attack the Party, attack our Party's candidates, using whispers, letters, leaflets, slander, and often using hooligans to coerce voters to cross out the names of Polish United Workers' Party candidates, especially the names of our Party's leaders. The purpose of this despicable rabble-rousing activity is to spread anarchist ideas, cause internal strife among the people, undermine and slander the path that the Party is leading the people forward on in this difficult period that is decisive for our fate.

	Some people, consciously or unconsciously, have helped the reactionary forces in this regard. This has been most evident in the current election campaign process.

	Some candidates are using any means necessary to win votes, and to achieve this goal they are using crude rabble-rousing tactics and empty promises. The bottom line of their program is simply to criticize all the achievements made by People's Poland (despite its mistakes) under the leadership of the Party. Such candidates are truly unworthy of a seat in the future parliament because they will confuse the interests of the state and the people with their own interests and ambitions.

	Gomułka believes that the actions of the reactionary elements must not be viewed passively.

	Gomułka said, "I am deeply convinced that in the upcoming elections, the people of our country will demonstrate their political wisdom, their sense of responsibility for the fate of the country, their long-tested patriotism, and will not listen to all the rumors and gossip of reactionaries, agitators, and troublemakers. I am deeply convinced that our people will oppose the slogans of suspicious elements. I am deeply convinced of the people's desire for unity and their trust in our program and in the various parties of the National Unity Front. The vast majority of Poles, men and women, will respond to the call of the various parties of the National Unity Front and elect the candidates who are ranked at the top of the candidate list according to the number of seats in the electoral district."

	Imperialism is attempting to make the international atmosphere tense. The people of the Middle Eastern countries do not feel that they exist in a vacuum, and they hope to be the masters of their own land and wealth.

	Gomułka continued by saying that the parliamentary elections are being held under the characteristic of a recently tense international atmosphere and the rampant aggression of imperialist forces. These forces are intensifying their attacks on the socialist camp countries and all progressive forces.

	The Anglo-French aggression against Egypt resulted in failure, discrediting the aggressors. However, the situation in this very important and volatile region of the world remains tense. The United States is taking advantage of the failure of the Anglo-French aggressors to strengthen its own position in the Middle East. The so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" demonstrates this point, and the United States justifies this doctrine on the grounds that the failure of the Anglo-French countries has created a vacuum in the region, and the United States has an unshirkable duty to fill this vacuum. However, the people of the countries living in this region have a different opinion. They do not feel that they exist in a vacuum. They hope to be the masters of their own land and wealth and do not want to be protected by an uninvited protector.

	This statement by the United States government is a step that endangers peace. This statement shows that the imperialist world intends to continue to use the threat of force to obstruct the rising tide of national liberation movements in Asia and Africa.

	In West Germany, the army that had not long ago attacked the whole of Europe and placed it under cruel occupation is continuing to arm itself. Based on the lessons we have learned from numerous painful historical experiences, the re-militarization of the Federal Republic of Germany and the constant incitement of German border revisionists and revanchists are a danger that threatens Poland, threatens Europe, and threatens world peace.

	To defend Poland's borders, we need sincere and friendly allies. The decisive force that guarantees that these borders will not be violated is the Soviet Union.

	Due to the current international situation, especially the continuous armament of the Federal Republic of Germany, we have to unite all patriotic forces at home and implement a foreign policy that strengthens Poland's position in the world and makes the strength of our allies and friends, headed by the Soviet Union, support our strength.

	Gomułka said: "To defend our borders, we need sincere and friendly allies. The decisive force that guarantees that these borders will not be violated is the Soviet Union. The strength of the Soviet Union, coupled with the strength of the entire consolidated and united socialist camp, is the best guarantee that the situation can develop in a way that can completely avoid war. Consolidating the strength of our camp is particularly important for the cause of peace, especially as international tensions are increasing."

	Gomułka said that the alliance of socialist countries, the alliance of our allies and friends - including the two major powers of the Soviet Union and People's China - is pursuing a policy of international reconciliation, a policy of peace.

	People's Poland attaches great importance to friendly relations with the People's Republic of China, which is having a major impact on peace in Asia and the world. Our Party also cherishes its relations with the Chinese Communist Party, which is making a very important contribution to the scientific development of the path of human progress and to the science of Marxism-Leninism. We are pleased to note that the countries of Southeast Asia are breaking free from imperialism and gaining freedom, are pursuing a policy of non-alignment in military blocs, and are working to consolidate the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, principles put forward in cooperation with the People's Republic of China.

	Of utmost importance to Poland and the security of its borders is the fact that ideological ties bind us together with all our neighbors, all of whom are signatories to the defensive Warsaw Pact. We have established friendly relations with our neighbor, the German Democratic Republic, which is building socialism. We have expressed our readiness to also adjust our relations with the Federal Republic of Germany. If some spokespersons for the government of the Federal Republic of Germany make contradictory remarks - which may be due to the temporary influence of domestic policies - then we are not in a hurry and we can wait.

	The United Workers' Party has proven to be the leading party of People's Poland. There is hope for new victories on the road to building socialism in Poland.

	Gomułka concluded by saying that the Polish people have enriched their history with rich chapters of struggle for national and social liberation, and for progress and social justice. We take the best traditions of this struggle as the cornerstone of our Party. It is not words, but facts, that show that our Party, the Polish Workers' Party, is the party of the working class and all the working people, the guiding and leading party of People's Poland. It will take some time to fully achieve the goals set by our Party and the other parties of the National Unity Front together. Only further action by the working people, continuing to move forward along the path pointed out by our Party, will make it possible to realize our election program and bring further achievements to Poland and its people. May the parliamentary election day on January 20 be a hope for new achievements and new victories on the difficult road, that is, on the road to building socialism in Poland.

    哥穆尔卡号召支持全国阵线候选人
    投票拥护主权、社会主义和民主的政策
    新华社华沙16日电　据波兰通讯社讯：波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡14日在华沙议员候选人和选民会见的时候发表了长篇演说。
    哥穆尔卡说：尽管目前阶段有各种困难，我们可以而且需要激发全国人民的爱国精神、成熟思考和负责精神。群众性地参加选举，大批地投票支持全国统一阵线，支持它的主要候选人，支持对波兰统一工人党中央委员会第八次全体会议的纲领作了贡献的人，这就会向全世界表明，在工人阶级领导下的波兰人民是一致而团结的，他们支持主权、社会主义和民主的政策。
    哥穆尔卡接着说，我们党的八中全会指出了在波兰建设社会主义的道路。在这条道路上，我们正在消除过去时期的错误，同时利用过去十二年人民波兰在我们党的领导下在生活的许多方面取得的巨大成就。
    波苏友谊进一步加强了。苏军暂驻波兰符合波兰边境安全的要求。
    我们已经在平等和互不干涉内政的基础上，在把我们同苏联团结在一起的社会主义思想的基础上，在目标共同以及在国际团结、同盟和友谊的基础上，调整了我们同苏联的关系。波苏友谊早就存在了。它是作为波兰和俄国的工人阶级在反对沙皇制度的共同斗争中的友谊而诞生的，后来在对纳粹的战争年月中、在战后共同为世界和平而斗争的年月中，发展成为我们两国人民的兄弟友谊，建设更好和更公正的生活的共同理想，使得这种友谊进一步加强了。1956年11月苏波莫斯科会谈消除了我们两国关系中的不正常现象、有害于这种友谊的现象，它为我们两国人民间的兄弟关系的进一步发展和加强奠定了牢固的基础。
    哥穆尔卡在谈到苏军部队暂时驻扎在波兰领土上的问题时说，这不仅是我们所同意的，而且首先是符合我国边境安全的要求的。苏联军队暂时驻扎在波兰并不是波兰政策中的消极因素，而是积极因素。
    党和政府的基本目标是改善劳动人民的生活条件。党决不会把政权让给反动派。
    哥穆尔卡接着说，在我们的内部关系方面，我们正在坚持不渝地实现八中全会所规定的社会主义法制。尽管国家财政情况困难，我们还是尽可能地提高了一些部门的职工的工资。
    哥穆尔卡说，我们刚刚开始走上党的八中全会所规划的道路。我们提倡的许多东西还必须经过试验和批判地进行分析。在许多问题上，还需作出决定。
    党的领导的基本目标，政府的基本目标是经常而有计划地尽一切力量改善劳动人民的生活条件，同时利用波兰的工业化，改进我们的经济并且从过去的经验中吸取教训。我们不作以后也不会作任何轻率的保证，而要经常而不屈不挠地实现我们所宣布的可以做到的事情。我们生产多少，我们就有多少。如果我们依靠我们的手和脑的劳动提高产量、降低成本和改进质量，我们就会有更多。党和政府可以向你们保证，它们将尽一切力量使你们的劳动成果不被浪费，使你们的劳动成果充分地为全国人民造福。
    在目前的国内情况和国际情况下，这是唯一的政策，唯一现实的纲领。
    哥穆尔卡强调说，这次选举是有特别重要意义的。在这次选举中全国人民有责任宣布他们支持或者反对八中全会所制定的革新我国生活的纲领。全国人民表示支持这个纲领，就是创造执行这个纲领的前提。
    工人阶级的革命的政党波兰统一工人党决不会把政权让给反动派和在波兰复辟资本主义的人。我们之所以不放弃它是由于其他任何一种政权对于波兰说来都将是一种悲惨的灾难，而对于工人阶级，对于城乡全体劳动人民说来，任何其他一种政权将比最坏的人民政权也要恶劣许多倍。
    反动势力利用民主化和社会生活自由的扩大来煽动风潮。波兰人民决不听煽动分子的流言蜚语。
    从选举运动的过程就可以很清楚地看出来，各种各样的政治渣滓、不负责任的煽动者以及捣乱分子，已经趁着在民主化的浪潮抬起头来，公开地和秘密地进行活动的反动分子正在设法影响选举的进行。这些分子攻击人民政权的一种方式就是呼吁抵制这次选举。他们利用民主化和社会生活自由的扩大，利用我国今天正在应付的困难，来煽动风潮，散布混乱，使我们难以完成克服当前困难的任务。反动势力对人民波兰一贯采取的态度可以用一句话来概括：越坏越好。他们暗中唆使选民把选票上的名字全都划掉。他们攻击党，攻击我们党的候选人，用窃窃私语、写信、散发传单、进行诽谤，并且经常利用流氓分子胁迫等方式要选民划掉波兰统一工人党候选人的名字，特别是划掉我们党的领导人的名字。这种卑鄙的煽动人心的活动的目的，是要在目前对我们的命运有决定意义的困难时期散布无政府主义思想，使人民内讧，破坏并毁谤党领导人民前进的道路。
    有一些人有意识地或无意识地在这方面帮助了反动势力。在目前竞选过程中，这一点表现得最为明显。
    某些候选人为了争取选票不择手段，他们为了要达到这个目的而使用粗劣的煽动人心的手段和空头诺言，他们的纲领归根结蒂只是指责人民波兰（尽管犯了错误）在党领导下获得的一切成就，这样的候选人真是不配在将来的议会中得到一个席位。因为他将把国家和人民的利益同他自己的利益和野心混为一谈。
    哥穆尔卡认为决不能消极地看待反动分子的行为。
    哥穆尔卡说，我深信，在即将举行的选举中，我国人民将表现出他们的政治智慧，对国家的命运的责任感，它的久经考验的爱国主义，不听反动派、煽惑分子和捣乱分子的一切流言蜚语。我深信，我们人民会反对可疑分子的口号。我深信人民要求团结的意志，他们对我们的纲领、对全国统一阵线各政党的信任。绝大多数波兰人，不论男女，都将响应全国统一阵线各政党的呼吁，选举按照选区席次数额排在候选人名单前列的候选人。
    帝国主义企图使国际气氛紧张起来。中东各国人民并没有觉得自己是生存在真空之中，他们希望成为自己国土和财富的主人。
    哥穆尔卡接着说，议会选举是在最近国际气氛紧张起来、帝国主义势力侵略气焰嚣张这样的特点下举行的。这些势力正在加紧进攻社会主义阵营国家，加紧进攻一切进步力量。
    英法两国对埃及所发动的进攻，结果遭受了失败，使得侵略者威信扫地。但是，世界上这一个十分重要和一触即发的地区的局势，却仍然是紧张的。美国利用英法侵略者的失败来加强它自己在中东的地位。所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”就表明了这一点，美国为这种主义辩解的理由是，由于英法两国遭受了失败，在这个地区就造成了真空，美国义不容辞，必须来填补这种真空。但是，居住在这个地区的各国人民却有不同的意见。他们并没有觉得自己是生存在真空之中。他们希望成为自己的国土和财富的主人，不愿意受一个不邀自来的保护者的保护。
    美国政府的这种声明是一个危害和平的步骤。这种声明表明，帝国主义世界打算继续以武力的威胁来阻挠亚非两洲日益高涨的民族解放运动。
    在西德曾经在不久以前进攻整个欧洲而把它置于残酷的占领之下的那种军队，目前正在继续武装。根据我们在不少的惨痛的历史经验中所得到的教训，德意志联邦共和国的重新军国主义化以及德国边界修正主义者和复仇主义者得到经常的鼓动的情况，是一种危险，它威胁着波兰，威胁着欧洲和全世界的和平。
    为了保卫波兰的边境，需要真诚的和友好的盟国。保证这种边境不遭侵犯的决定性力量就是苏联。
    由于目前的国际局势，特别是由于德意志联邦共和国不断武装，因此，我们就不得不团结国内的一切爱国力量，不得不执行一种加强波兰在全世界的地位并且使以苏联为首的我们的盟国和友邦的力量支持我们的力量的外交政策。
    哥穆尔卡说：为了保卫我们的边境，我们需要真诚的和友好的盟国。保证这种边境不遭侵犯的决定性力量就是苏联。苏联的力量加上整个巩固而团结的社会主义阵营的力量就足使局势可以在完全避免战争的情况下发展的最好保证。巩固我们阵营的力量对于和平事业是特别重要的，特别是由于国际紧张局势日益加剧。
    哥穆尔卡说，社会主义国家联盟、我们的盟国和友邦的联盟——包括苏联和人民中国两个大国——奉行着一种国际和解的政策，一种和平的政策。
    人民波兰十分重视同中华人民共和国的友好关系，中国正在对亚洲的和全世界的和平发生重大的影响。我们党也十分珍视它同中国共产党的关系，中国共产党正在对人类进步之路的科学的发展，对马克思列宁主义科学作出十分重要的贡献。我们高兴地注意到，东南亚各国正在摆脱帝国主义而获得自由，正在奉行一种不参加军事集团的政策，并且正努力巩固著名的国际关系五项原则，在中华人民共和国合作下提出的原则。
    对于波兰和它的边境的安全具有极其重大意义的是这个事实：意识形态的纽带把我们同我们的一切邻国结合在一起，我们都是防御性的华沙条约的缔约国。我们已经同我们的邻国、正在建设社会主义的德意志民主共和国建立了友好关系。我们已经表示准备也调整我国同德意志联邦共和国的关系。如果德意志联邦共和国政府的某些发言人发表相反的言论——这里可能是出于内政政策的暂时影响——那么我们并不着急，我们可以等待。
    事实证明，统一工人党是人民波兰领导的党。在波兰建设社会主义的道路上有取得新胜利的希望。
    哥穆尔卡最后说，波兰人民曾用争取民族解放和社会解放、争取进步和社会正义的斗争的丰富的篇章充实了它的历史。我们把这一斗争的最好的传统做为我们党的基石。不是语言，而是事实，说明我们的党，波兰工人党、是工人阶级和全体劳动人民的党，是人民波兰的指导和领导的党。要完全达到我们党和全国统一阵线的其他各党派一道规定的目标是需要一些时间的。只有劳动人民的进一步的行动，继续沿着我们党所指出的道路前进，才有可能实现我们的竞选纲领，才有可能给波兰和人民带来进一步的成就。愿1月20日的议会选举日成为在困难的道路上，也就是在波兰建设社会主义的道路上取得新成就和新胜利的希望。
