    On January 14th, in a small building by the Jialing River in Chongqing, a young man in a yellow cotton army uniform was intently watching the graphite powder in a crucible. He is Li Weilian, a demobilized soldier working in the processing group of the Chongqing Waste Product Recycling Station. He told the reporter that, according to the results of the experiment, the graphite content in the graphite powder was a little higher than yesterday's experiment, but it needs to be increased to more than 70% to be suitable for the needs of various foundries. This is a problem that Li Weilian has been pondering recently.

    The story is like this: In the fourth quarter of last year, after many experiments, Li Weilian restored the life of discarded batteries. He discovered that each ton of waste batteries can be further separated into 42 kilograms of ammonium chloride, 123 kilograms of manganese dioxide, and 95 kilograms of graphite. After such processing, the useful materials recovered from each ton of waste batteries are worth about 203 yuan. However, this 23-year-old member of the Communist Youth League still feels dissatisfied with the amount and quality of chemical raw materials that can be extracted from waste batteries, and he is currently racking his brains to study this issue.

    In July 1955, Li Weilian bid farewell to the border guards guarding the border of Yunnan Province. Full of enthusiasm, he prepared to go to a large factory to participate in construction. However, when he learned that he would be assigned to the Chongqing Commercial Bureau to engage in waste product recycling, he couldn't help but feel annoyed. "To be honest, my thinking just couldn't get through at the time," Li Weilian said. "Waste products are the scrap metal that people usually talk about. Collecting waste products was the most unpromising thing to do in the old society. Why did this unlucky job happen to fall on me?"

    The education of five years of military life enabled Li Weilian, although he was not satisfied with his job, to accurately weigh the dozens or hundreds of tons of waste steel that came in and out every day. It was in this ordinary job that he was educated. He said, "I didn't like this job before, but now I feel more and more fond of it and fascinated by it."

    One day, he found a small green iron box from a pile of scrap iron. No one could recognize what it was. Later, someone from a repair shop told them that it was a computer that could be used with a little repair, estimated to be worth more than 600 yuan. This incident made him think for a long time. He thought, if he was a little careless, this computer worth more than 600 yuan would have become molten iron in the iron-smelting furnace. In addition, goods that could not be bought on the market have also been found in the pile of scrap iron he was preparing to send for smelting. This saved the urgent needs of units in urgent need and helped others complete their tasks. These things changed Li Weilian's understanding of his work. He realized that waste product recycling is not a simple transaction, but a gate to prevent waste. He is the person guarding the gate. His warehouse is also a waste material inspection station, and he is an inspector, who should find ways to make each waste product contribute more to the country's construction. Because he loves this job, he no longer hates waste products. Every day, he searches for treasures for the country in the piles of waste. So far, he and his comrades in the group have carefully selected more than 3,000 machine parts of useable value from the waste products.

    To love this job is to study it and become an expert. Because Li Weilian was not familiar with the business and did not recognize the goods, he was once deceived by a merchant into buying a drill bit on a drilling machine - a very valuable part. That time, Li Weilian actually realized the farewell message of the military leader: In the new position, be humble in learning and work hard. In this way, Li Weilian learned from several technicians in the group, and from the purchasing agents and truck drivers of various relevant units, the names, types, grades, years, and uses of various waste products. In his work, he also often tried to arouse merchants to comment on commodities, and learned from the practical experience that those merchants had accumulated for decades. In this way, Li Weilian's business knowledge has been greatly improved.

    On Li Weilian's desk, there are more than 20 kinds of batteries, as well as books such as "Material Analysis in Factory Laboratories" and "Evaporation Engineering and Equipment." He told reporters that in order to bring old batteries back to life, he studied relevant parts of organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry in secondary schools and universities. Now, he is studying relevant business books hard every night. Due to the improvement of theoretical knowledge and practical work ability, he understood that some waste products can be revived, so he and his comrades in the group studied how to assemble broken objects into useful machines. Through collective efforts, this processing group has assembled more than 90 flatbed carts, 30 telephones, 7 typewriters, a drilling machine, a jeep, and a truck from waste products from February last year to the present, and has also repaired more than 630 tires. Because of his good work, Li Weilian attended the first National Advanced Workers Representative Conference of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Beijing in July last year.

    Li Weilian said that he is now determined to make himself a "waste product expert" who is proficient in the business of this industry.

    决心做个“废品专家”
    新华社记者　龚成华
    1月14日，在重庆嘉陵江边一幢小楼上，有一个穿着黄棉军服的青年人正在专心地看着坩锅内的石墨粉。他就是重庆废品收购站加工组的工作人员、复员军人李维廉。他告诉记者说，根据试验的结果，石墨粉里石墨的含量比昨天试验的高一点，但是要提高到70％以上才适合各翻砂厂的需要。这是李维廉最近苦心思索的一个问题。
    事情原来是这样的：去年第四季度，李维廉经过多次试验，把人们丢弃了的废电池恢复了生命，他发现每吨废电池里可以再分出四十二公斤氯化铵，一百二十三公斤二氧化锰，九十五公斤石墨。经过这样加工后，每吨废电池可收回的有用材料约值二百零三元。但是，这个二十三岁的青年团员对废电池里所能提炼出来的化学原料的分量和质量还感到不满足，他最近正在精心竭虑地研究这个问题。
    1955年7月，李维廉向守卫在云南省国境线上的边防军告别，怀着满腔热情，准备到大工厂去参加建设。但是，当他知道他将被分配到重庆商业局去搞废品收购工作的时候，却不免烦恼起来。“说真话，当时我的思想无论怎样也不通，”李维廉说，“废品就是平常说的破铜烂铁，收购废品在旧社会是最没有出息的人干的事情，为什么这倒霉的工作偏偏轮到我？”
    五年部队生活的教养，使李维廉虽然不满意自己的工作，但还是把每天进出的几十吨、几百吨的废钢铁准确地过磅完毕。就在这个平凡的工作中，他受到了教育。他说：“我以前不喜欢这个工作，现在我愈来愈对它感到亲切和迷恋。”
    有一天，他从一堆废铁里，发现了一只绿色的小铁盒子，大家都认不出它是什么东西。后来，一家修理行的人告诉他们，这是一架稍加修理就能用的计算机，估计要值六百多元。这件事使他长久地沉思过。他想，如果马虎一点，这值六百多元的计算机就成了炼铁炉里的铁水了。此外，在市上买不到的货色，在他正准备送去冶炼的废铁堆里也找到过，这曾救了急需单位的急，帮助别人完成了任务。这些事情改变了李维廉对自己工作的认识，他意识到废品回收工作不是简单的交易买卖，而是一道杜绝浪费的关口，自己就是把守关口的人。他的仓库也是一个废旧物资检验所，自己是个检验员，应该想办法，使每个废品多为国家的建设出点力气。因为他热爱上这个工作，他就不再讨厌废品了。每天，他都在废品堆里为国家找寻珠宝。到目前为止，他和组里的同志一起，从废品中精挑细选出来的有使用价值的机器零件已经有三千多件。
    热爱这个工作就要钻研它，使自己成为内行。李维廉由于业务不熟，不识货，曾经被商人骗买去了钻探机上的钻刀——一种很贵重的零件。那次，李维廉才实际了解到部队首长的临别赠言：在新岗位上要虚心学习，刻苦钻研。这样，李维廉便向组里的几位技术工人学，向各有关单位的采购员、汽车司机学各种废品的名称、类型、成色、年限、用途等。他在工作中，还常常设法引起商人对商品发表议论，从中学习那些商人几十年积累起来的实际经验。就是这样，李维廉的业务知识大大提高了。
    在李维廉的办公桌上，堆满二十几种电池，还放着“工厂实验室中的物料分析”、“蒸发工程及装备”等书籍。他告诉记者，为了使旧电池起死回生，他学习了中等学校和高等学校的有机化学、无机化学中的有关部分。现在，他每天晚上都在刻苦地学习有关业务书籍。由于理论知识和实际工作能力的提高，他懂得了有些废品可以复活，就和组里同志研究怎样把零碎的物件装配成为有用的机器。经过集体的努力，这个加工组从去年2月到现在，利用废品装配成了九十多部板车、三十部电话机、七部打字机、一台钻床，以及一辆吉普车和一辆卡车，还修补好了六百三十多个轮胎。李维廉因为工作得好，在去年7月，到北京出席了全国供销合作社第一次先进工作者代表会议。
    李维廉说，他现在立志要使自己成为一个精通本行业务的“废品专家”。
