Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, January 26th: According to TASS, Jordanian Minister of State Abdullah Rimawi said in Beirut: "Negotiations with Britain on ending the British-Jordanian treaty will begin in early February. It is very likely that all of Britain's interests in Jordan under this treaty, primarily air bases, will be abolished."

Rimawi made these remarks to Lebanese journalists while passing through Beirut on his way back to Jordan from Cairo. He also said: "What we are concerned with now is ending the treaty concluded with Britain and becoming a completely independent country."

Rimawi said that the "communist danger" clamored by the West does not exist in Jordan, and this "danger" is imaginary.

    约旦关心的是废除英约条约
    约国务大臣里马维对黎巴嫩记者发表谈话
    据新华社27日讯　据塔斯社贝鲁特26日讯：约旦国务大臣阿卜杜拉·里马维在贝鲁特说：“在2月初将开始同英国谈判结束英国—约旦条约问题。很可能，英国根据这个条约在约旦的全部利益，首先是空军基地，将被取消。”
    里马维在从开罗回国途中经过贝鲁特。他还对黎巴嫩记者说：“我们现在关心的是结束同英国缔结的条约，成为完全独立的国家。”
    里马维说，西方叫嚣的“共产主义危险”在约旦并不存在，这种“危险”是空想出来的。
