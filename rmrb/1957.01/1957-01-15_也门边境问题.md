Yemen Border Issue

Yemen is located in the southwest corner of the Arabian Peninsula, near the exit of the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean. It covers an area of approximately 195,000 square kilometers and has a population of approximately five million.

In the mostly desert Arabian Peninsula, Yemen is a rich place with more rainfall, fertile land, and abundant agricultural products, earning it the name "Arabia Felix."

Before World War I, Yemen was occupied by Turkey. During World War I, the Yemeni people resisted and defeated the Turks, establishing an independent state.

Due to Yemen's rich oil resources and its important strategic position, it has long been coveted by Britain. In 1839, Britain forcibly occupied Aden, a territory of Yemen, and later continued to encroach on land near Aden, placing the southern region of Yemen under its so-called "protection." However, Yemen has repeatedly stated its unwillingness to relinquish sovereignty over these territories.

Since Yemen's independence, it has fought a long struggle against British colonialists to recover these lost lands. In 1934, Britain provoked a war between Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Taking advantage of Yemen's difficult situation, it forced Yemen to sign the Treaty of Sana'a with Britain. The treaty stipulated that within forty years, both parties should establish a joint planning committee to determine the border between Yemen and the Aden "protectorate"; before it was determined, both parties should maintain the status quo of the border as of the date of signing the treaty. In this treaty, Britain deliberately failed to define the border between Yemen and the Aden colony and "protectorate" in order to further nibble away at Yemen's territory. Over the years, Britain has been using the so-called "protectorate" to continuously carry out aggressive activities against Yemen, threatening Yemen's independence and sovereignty.

In 1949, rich oil resources were discovered in the Shabwah region on Yemen's southern border, where the boundary had not been demarcated, and Britain demanded that Yemen cede the Shabwah region to Britain. After this request was rejected by Yemen, Britain occupied Shabwah by force.

Since 1951, despite repeated protests from the Yemeni government, Britain has begun to extensively build strategic highways, military airports, and other military facilities in the undemarcated areas, and connected the roads between Britain's newly built oil refinery in Aden and the Shabwah oil field. Britain also threatened the Islamic leaders of nine regions in the undemarcated area, demanding that they accept Britain's "federal plan" so that these regions would also become British "protectorates."

In 1951, Yemen and Britain signed an "Agreement on the Mutual Dispatch of Diplomatic Envoys and the Establishment of a Diplomatic Committee to Resolve Border Disputes." However, after the signing of this agreement, Britain still did not stop its aggression against Yemen. Britain has assembled a large number of troops equipped with tanks and armored vehicles on the Yemeni border, frequently conducting military exercises, infringing on Yemen's borders and airspace, bombing Yemeni cities and villages, and intensifying its intimidation and provocation against the Yemeni people.

Britain's aggressive acts against Yemen have been unanimously opposed by the Yemeni government and people. Yemeni representatives have repeatedly complained to the United Nations about Britain's aggressive acts against Yemen, and have directly protested to Britain more than ten times. However, the British aggressors have not only turned a deaf ear, but have recently provoked larger-scale armed aggression on the Yemeni border, indiscriminately bombing peaceful Yemeni towns and villages. The Yemeni government and the Arab League have both filed complaints with the United Nations, demanding an immediate end to British aggression against Yemen.

    也门边境问题
    也门位于阿拉伯半岛的西南角，靠近红海通往印度洋的出口处。它的面积约有十九万五千平方公里，居民约五百万。
    在多沙漠的阿拉伯半岛上，也门是一个富饶的地方，雨量较多，土地肥沃，农产品丰富，有“阿拉伯的乐园”之称。
    在第一次世界大战前，也门被土耳其侵占。第一次世界大战期间，也门人民反抗土耳其获胜，建立了独立的国家。
    由于也门拥有丰富的石油资源，在战略上占有重要地位，长期以来就被英国所垂涎。1839年，英国强占了也门的领土亚丁，以后又不断侵占了邻近亚丁附近的土地，并把也门南部地区置于它的所谓“保护”之下。但是，也门一再表示不愿放弃这些领土的主权。
    也门独立以后，为了收复这些失去的土地，曾长期同英国殖民者进行斗争。1934年，英国挑起也门同沙特阿拉伯之间的战争，它利用也门的困难处境，强迫也门同英国签订萨那条约。条约规定，在四十年内，双方应成立一个联合的计划委员会，以确定也门和亚丁“保护地”之间的疆界；在未确定以前，双方应保持条约签订日的边界现状。在这个条约中，英国故意不确定也门和亚丁殖民地以及“保护地”之间的疆界，以便它进一步蚕食也门的领土。这些年来，英国一直利用所谓“保护地”对也门不断进行侵略活动，威胁也门的独立和主权。
    1949年，在也门南部边境未定界的沙波尔地区发现了丰富的石油资源，英国更要求也门将沙波尔地区割让给英国。这个要求遭到也门拒绝后，英国便用武力把沙波尔占领了。
    1951年以来，英国不顾也门政府的一再抗议，在未定界地区开始广泛地修筑战略公路、军用机场和其他军事设施，并把英国在亚丁新建的炼油厂和沙波尔石油矿区之间的公路连接起来。英国还威胁未定界内九个地区的伊斯兰教领袖，要他们接受英国的“联邦计划”，使这些地区也成为英国的“保护”地。
    1951年，也门和英国签订了一个“关于互派外交使节和组织外交委员会，以解决国界纠纷的协定”。但是，在这个协定签订以后，英国仍然没有停止对也门的侵略。英国在也门边境集结了大批配有坦克和装甲车的军队，经常举行军事演习，侵犯也门的边境和领空，轰炸也门的城市和乡村，变本加厉地对也门人民进行威吓和挑衅。
    英国对也门的侵略行为，遭到了也门政府和人民的一致反对。也门代表曾一再向联合国控诉英国对也门的侵略行为，并直接向英国提出抗议达十次之多。但是，英国侵略者不仅置若罔闻，最近并在也门边境挑起规模更大的武装侵略，滥炸也门的和平村镇。也门政府和阿拉伯联盟都已向联合国提出控诉，要求立即制止英国对也门的侵略。
