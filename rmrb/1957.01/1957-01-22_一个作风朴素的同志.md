    A Comrade of Simple Living
    Xiang Jiang

    Recently, I went to the Jiang'an District People's Committee in Wuhan City on business. Many comrades talked to me about Su Qide, the district chief of Jiang'an District and a Communist Party member, telling me many things about his simple and hardworking life. After hearing this, I couldn't help but want to tell others what I had heard.

    The district chief here is equivalent to a cadre at the prefectural level, and could have received many considerations in his life. However, before October of last year, District Chief Su had only been occupying one room for both office and sleep. After he got married in October last year, he initially insisted on only living in that one room, always saying, "Let's allocate the house to the comrades who need it more!" Later, some comrades suggested that it was not convenient to talk about work there, and he accepted another room.

    The whitewash on the walls of his office had already peeled off quite a bit. The General Affairs Section prepared to whitewash it and then apply a coat of paint. District Chief Su only agreed to whitewash it and refused to apply paint no matter what. He said, "Whitewashing is good enough, save the money for paint to solve other problems."

    When the weather turned cold, workers went to install a stove in District Chief Su's office, but he said, "I often go down to the streets and am rarely at home. Installing a stove is too wasteful. Just give me a brazier, and I can burn some charcoal to warm up when needed."

    District Chief Su went to the streets to attend meetings, whether it was as hot as July and August or as cold as it is now, he walked if it was nearby and rode a bicycle if it was far away. The city issued a car to the Jiang'an District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the District People's Committee, but District Chief Su never took the car. The District People's Committee had a tricycle, but he didn't use it either, leaving it there for the office to haul things. He always said, "When you go down to the streets, the people see you riding in a private car, and the conversation becomes unnatural!"

    According to regulations, responsible cadres in Wuhan receive a temporary special allowance of ten yuan per month. Since District Chief Su came to work in the district in 1954, he has never used this money, saving and turning it in every month.

    District Chief Su is so hardworking and simple in his own work and life, but he is extremely concerned about the general cadres. He saw that some street offices didn't have chairs when they held meetings, and when he came back, he discussed it with the General Affairs Section to see if it could be resolved immediately, and if it couldn't be resolved at the moment, whether it could be adjusted first. He said, "The two stools in my house can also be taken out!" At present, the Jiang'an District People's Committee has made ten benches that can seat two people for each street office. Once they are made, they can be distributed.

    Comrade Zhou Wenhua of the Construction Section told me about such a thing: The year before last, he worked at the Fujian Street Office. Because there were no organs nearby, the six or seven cadres in the office had no place to eat together, and everyone usually bought food from the stalls outside. After District Chief Su heard about it, he told the Personnel Section, "We must help them solve this problem. How can they do their work if the cadres don't eat well?" Soon, the district subsidized them a few yuan each month, and they hired someone who could cook, and the problem was solved.

    On the day I went to their office, Comrade Wang Yunjie of the General Affairs Section also told me about a small thing that happened that day: On a window in the office of the Construction Section, a horizontal wood had a small crack, and wind was blowing into the room. When District Chief Su found out, he said to the comrades in the General Affairs Section, "Why don't you ask someone to repair it for them? The weather is so cold and windy, how can people work?"

    Perhaps some people say that these are all small things, but it is through these things that the masses love District Chief Su even more, and they are all quietly learning from him.

    一个作风朴素的同志
    湘江
    最近，我因事到武汉市江岸区人民委员会去，许多同志同我谈起了江岸区区长、共产党员苏启德，告诉了我不少关于他的艰苦朴素的事情。我听了以后，也总是忍不住地想把听来的事情告诉给别人。
    这里的区长，相当于专区一级的干部，在生活上本来是可以受到很多照顾的，但是，在去年10月份以前，苏区长却一直只占用着一间又办公、又睡觉的房子。去年10月他结了婚，最初，他仍然坚持着只要住那一间，他总说：“把房子先分配给那些更需要的同志吧！”后来有些同志提出意见，说去他那里谈工作，不太方便，他才接受了另外一间房子。
    他的办公室墙壁上的白粉，早已经剥落了不少，总务股准备给他粉刷一下，再打上一层油漆。苏区长只同意上粉，无论如何不同意上油漆。他说：“粉刷一下就很不错了，把油漆的钱省下来，去解决其他问题。”
    天气冷了，工人去给苏区长的办公室安装火炉，他却说：“我经常下街道，在家的时候很少，安个火炉太浪费，你们给我个火盆，需要的时候烧点木炭烤烤就行了。”
    苏区长下街道去参加什么会议，不管是七、八月那样热，还是现在这样冷，近的走着去，远的就骑自行车。市里发给中共江岸区委会和区人民委员会一辆小汽车，苏区长从来不坐汽车；区人民委员会有一辆三轮车，他也不用，搁着给机关里拉东西。他总是说：“下街道，老百姓看你坐了一辆小包车，谈话就不自然了！”
    按规定，武汉市各区负责干部每月有十元的临时特别费，苏区长自1954年到区工作后，一直没有用过这笔钱，月月都原封不动地节约上交。
    苏区长自己的工作和生活是这样艰苦朴素，对于一般干部却是关心备至。他看到有些街道办事处开会时没有凳子，回来就和总务股商量，看看能不能立即解决，如果目前解决不了，能不能先调剂一下。他说：“我那房子里的两个凳子，也可以抽出来！”目前，江岸区人民委员会已为各街道办事处做了十条可坐两个人的板凳，做好了，就可以发下去。
    建设科的周文华同志对我说过这样一件事：前年，他在福建街办事处工作，因为附近没有机关，办事处的六、七个干部没地方搭伙，大家平日就在外面的摊子上买着吃。苏区长听说后，就和人事科说：“一定得帮他们解决这个问题，不让干部吃好饭，怎么能做工作呢？”不久，区里就每月补助他们几块钱，他们请了一个会做饭的，问题就解决了。
    我去他们机关的那一天，总务股的王云阶同志还告诉了我当天发生的一件小事：建设科的办公室的一个窗子上，有一根横木裂了一道不大的口子，往屋里面灌风，苏区长知道了，就对总务股的同志说：“为什么不请人给他们修一下呢？天气这样冷，又有风，人家怎么办公呢？”
    也许有人说，这些都是些小事，但是群众正是通过这样一些事情，才更加爱戴苏区长，并且都悄悄地在向他学习哩。
