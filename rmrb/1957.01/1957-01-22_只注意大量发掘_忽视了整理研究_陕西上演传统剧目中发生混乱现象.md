Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 19th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Qi Yuanzhen reported): After a large number of traditional repertoires have been excavated, the issue of how to further research, sort out, and improve them has not attracted the attention of relevant cultural and artistic departments in Shaanxi Province. Currently, some rough, chaotic, and unhealthy phenomena have appeared in the process of performing traditional repertoires by various theater troupes in Shaanxi Province. In some traditional repertoires performed by some troupes, the theme is very vague, with superstition and mythology intertwined, making it difficult for the audience to distinguish between good and bad after watching. Some repertoires even mix in some vulgar and low-level interests in the plot. Ugly and terrifying images that should not appear have also appeared on the stage. In some of the traditional repertoires performed, the inheritance of traditional performing arts and beautiful singing is also poorly done.

According to the reporter's recent understanding from relevant cultural departments and some theater troupes in Shaanxi Province about the reasons for the above-mentioned phenomena, the main reason is that in the past, relevant cultural departments only focused on organizing everyone to excavate in the work of excavating traditional repertoires, and did not promptly organize the broad social forces and artists to conduct research, sorting out, and improvement work in a planned manner. Secondly, some directors and artists believe that "old plays are all good plays" without analysis. They only focus on artistic forms and ignore the research on ideological content. Some artists even mistakenly believe that revising traditional repertoires is a "rude act." In addition, some theater troupes, in order to increase the number of performances and income, only pay attention to quantity and not enough attention to quality. Many opera workers believe that the cultural departments of Shaanxi Province should now conduct a good research on the excavated traditional repertoires.

### 只注意大量发掘　忽视了整理研究  陕西上演传统剧目中发生混乱现象

    只注意大量发掘　忽视了整理研究
    陕西上演传统剧目中发生混乱现象
    新华社西安19日电　新华社记者戚元珍报道：在大量传统剧目发掘出来以后，如何进一步加以研究、整理和提高的问题，还没有引起陕西省有关文化艺术部门的注意。目前，陕西省各地剧团上演传统剧目的过程中，出现了一些粗糙、混乱和不健康的现象。有的剧团上演的传统剧目中，主题思想非常模糊，迷信和神话纠缠在一起，使观众看后分不清是好是坏。有的剧目在情节上还夹杂着一些庸俗、低级趣味。舞台上还出现了不应有的丑恶和恐怖的形象。在演出的一些传统剧目中，对继承传统表演艺术和优美的唱腔方面也做得差。
    据记者最近向陕西省有关文化部门和一些剧团了解产生上述现象的原因，主要是有关文化部门过去在发掘传统剧目的工作中，只着重组织大家发掘，而没有及时地组织广大的社会力量和艺人们有计划地进行研究、整理和提高工作。其次，是有些导演和艺人不加分析地认为“老戏都是好戏”，他们只从艺术形式上着眼，而忽视了思想内容方面的研究。甚至有些艺人错误地认为修改传统剧目就是“粗暴行为”。另外，有些剧团为了增加演出场数和收入，只注意数量，对质量重视不够。许多戏曲工作者认为，陕西省文化部门目前应该对已发掘的传统剧目加以很好的研究。
