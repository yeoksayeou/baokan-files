Comrade Zhou Enlai, distinguished guests, comrades, friends:

    On behalf of all those present, and on behalf of the government, the Party, and all our Soviet people, I extend my greetings here to the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China headed by Comrade Zhou Enlai.

    During the visit of the Chinese comrades to Moscow, we held talks with them in the most friendly and comradely atmosphere of understanding.

    The talks showed that we have complete understanding of each other on the current international issues and on the issues of relations between our two countries, and that our views are identical.

    Today, we will sign a joint statement on the results of the talks between the two government delegations.

    This statement is a document of great political and historical significance. The statement reflects everything new in the mutual relations of socialist countries today—relations between equal countries united under the great goal of struggling for communism, for peace, and for the happiness of all peoples.

    After a period of some relaxation in international tension, we are now faced anew with the fact that the situation in Asia, Africa, and Europe is becoming tense again. As everyone knows, this situation has arisen because of the aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel; because of the subversive activities of the imperialists in instigating riots in Hungary; and because the United States has put forward the "Eisenhower Doctrine," which shows the new expansionist policy of American monopoly capitalists in the Arab East.

    We should further unite the countries of the socialist camp and more closely unite all forces struggling for world peace and national independence, in order to counter the imperialists' attacks on independent countries in the Middle East and countries that have embarked on the path of socialist development.

   The unity of the Socialist countries is the decisive condition for our further achievements and the greatest peace factor.

    Developing friendship on an equal footing, strengthening the unity of the socialist camp countries, and uniting the forces of all countries to fight for peace are the important tasks now.

    The friendship and cooperation between the peoples of the two great countries in the world—the Soviet Union and China—are a guarantee that we will certainly be able to solve any complex and difficult domestic and foreign tasks.

    I propose a toast to the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet and Chinese peoples!

    To the further prosperity and consolidation of the People's Republic of China!

    To Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of China!

    To the Chinese Government Delegation!

### 布尔加宁主席在欢送宴会上的讲话

    布尔加宁主席在欢送宴会上的讲话亲爱的周恩来同志，各位来宾，同志们，朋友们：
    我谨代表全体到会者，代表政府、党和我们全体苏联人民在这里向以周恩来同志为首的中华人民共和国政府代表团致意。
  在中国同志访问莫斯科期间，我们同他们在最友好和同志谅解的气氛中举行了会谈。
    会谈中表明，在当前的国际问题上，在我们两国相互关系的问题上，我们彼此是完全谅解的，我们的观点是一致的。
    今天我们要签署一项关于两国政府代表团会谈结果的联合声明。
    这个声明是一个有巨大政治意义和历史意义的文件。声明中反映了现今社会主义国家相互关系——团结在为共产主义、为和平和各国人民的幸福而奋斗的伟大目标下的平等国家之间的关系中的一切新东西。
    在国际紧张局势有了一段时期某些缓和之后，现在我们重新面对着亚洲、非洲、欧洲局势再次趋于紧张的事实。大家知道，这种局面的产生，是由于英国、法国和以色列对埃及进行侵略；由于帝国主义者在匈牙利策动暴动的颠覆活动；由于美国提出了表明美国垄断资本家在阿拉伯东方的新的扩张方针的“艾森豪威尔主义”。
    我们应该使社会主义阵营国家更进一步团结起来，使一切为世界和平和民族独立而奋斗的力量更紧密地联合起来，以对付帝国主义者对中近东独立国家和走上社会主义发展道路的国家的进攻。
    社会主义国家的团结是我们取得进一步成就的决定性条件，是最大的和平因素。
    在平等基础上发展友谊，加强社会主义阵营各国的团结，联合起各国为和平而奋斗的力量，这就是现在的重要任务。
    世界上两个伟大国家的人民——苏联人民和中国人民的友好和合作，是我们一定能解决任何复杂和困难的国内外任务的保证。
    我建议为苏中两国人民的友好和合作干杯！
    为中华人民共和国的进一步繁荣和巩固干杯！
    为中国国务院总理周恩来同志干杯！
    为中国政府代表团干杯！
