Inner Mongolia and Northeast Minority Nationalities Investigation Team
Collects Qing Dynasty Documents of the Mongolian and Daur Nationalities

    This report (reporter) The Inner Mongolia and Northeast Minority Nationalities Investigation Team, organized by the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, is about to conclude its first stage of investigation work.

    The investigation team was divided into four groups in mid-October last year and went to Bayanhot, Morin Dawa Banner, Oroqen Autonomous Banner, and Arun Banner to conduct investigations. The Mongolian investigation team conducted the first step of investigation at Yanfu Temple in Bayanhot, and collected account books and draft documents from the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty. After preliminary sorting of these materials, a general survey of social and historical conditions began in mid-November.

    The Daur investigation team focused on collecting ethnic historical documents during the initial period. Currently, ten historical books and eight maps have been collected. Nine of the history books are written in Manchu, and several maps were drawn during the Qing Dynasty, which contain the names of small rivers on both sides of the Heilongjiang River. This is of great help in understanding the surnames and place names of the Daur people. The Oroqen and Solon investigation teams went deep into the masses for individual interviews and discussions. The Oroqen investigation team has now compiled 100,000 words of written materials, mainly on economic conditions and customs.

    Throughout the entire work process, the investigation teams received assistance from the local Party and government leaders. The people of all ethnic minorities warmly welcomed the investigation team. (Zhao Fuxing)

    内蒙古、东北少数民族调查组
    搜集到蒙古族、达呼尔族的清代文献
    本报讯　全国人民代表大会民族委员会组织的内蒙古、东北少数民族调查组，第一阶段的调查工作将告一段落。
    调查组在去年10月中旬分为四个小组，先后分别到巴彦浩特、莫力达瓦旗、鄂伦春自治旗和阿荣旗等地进行了调查工作。蒙古族调查组在巴彦浩特对延福寺进行了第一步调查，在调查中已搜集到清朝同治年间以来的账册和文书底稿等。将这些材料初步作了整理后，从11月中旬开始进行了一般社会历史情况的调查。
    达呼尔族调查组在开始一个时期，集中搜集了民族历史文献。目前，已经搜集到历史书籍十本、地图八张。史书中有九本是用满文写成的，有几张地图是在清代绘制的，其中载有黑龙江两岸细小河流的名称，这对了解达呼尔人的姓氏和山川地名都有很大帮助。鄂伦春族和索伦族调查组，曾深入到群众中进行个别访问和座谈。鄂伦春调查组现在已经整理出十万字的书面材料，其中以经济情况和风俗习惯方面的材料较多。
    各调查小组在整个工作过程中，受到了当地党、政领导的帮助。各个少数民族人民群众都很热烈地欢迎调查组。　（赵复兴）
