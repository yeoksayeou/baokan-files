Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 31st - According to Antara News Agency's Palembang dispatch, South Sumatra Governor Winarno Danuatmodjo announced at a provincial government committee meeting on the 27th that he had decided to return his commission to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Sources believe he made this decision under local pressure. Three provincial government committee members already flew from Palembang to Jakarta on the 29th. It is reported that their arrival in Jakarta is related to the current situation in South Sumatra.

The South Sumatra Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party issued a statement on the 27th, saying that the Indonesian Communist Party feels that all levels of society in South Sumatra are not satisfied with the progress of construction, etc., but there are still very broad and feasible democratic ways to solve these problems, without resorting to anti-democratic actions that trample on the ideals of the declaration of independence. The statement also condemned the actions of Hussein and Simbolon in launching coups in Central Sumatra and North Sumatra.

An organization called the "South Sumatra Social Aspirations Transmission Committee" held a meeting on the 28th and decided to send Palembang Mayor Ali Amin and others as representatives to Jakarta to meet with the President, Prime Minister, and Minister of Internal Affairs to express their wishes. The committee passed a resolution demanding the implementation of broad “true autonomy” focusing on counties and cities, to be implemented by a "legitimate committee," with funding raised from the South Sumatra region.

The South Sumatra local authorities had previously ordered on the 24th to prohibit carrying more than 5,000 rupiahs out of the region and stopped handing over tax revenue to the central government. The Indonesian Minister of Internal Affairs stated that this was illegal.

    印度尼西亚共产党南苏门答腊委员会
    主张采用民主途径解决政局
    该省地方势力要求实施广泛“自治”
    据新华社雅加达31日电　据安塔拉通讯社巨港消息，南苏门答腊省省长威纳诺·达努阿莫佐27日在省政府委员会会议上宣布，他决定把自己的委任状交回内政部。消息认为他是在地方的压力下采取这个决定的。三个省政府委员已经在29日坐飞机离开巨港到雅加达。据报道，他们来到雅加达同南苏门答腊的目前形势有关。
    印度尼西亚共产党南苏门答腊委员会在27日发表声明说，印度尼西亚共产党感到南苏门答腊各阶层对建设的进展等情况并不满意，但是要解决这些问题还有非常广泛可行的民主途径，用不着采取反民主的和践踏独立宣言理想的行动。这个声明还指责了侯赛尼和西姆波朗在中苏门答腊和北苏门答腊发动政变的行动。
    一个叫作“南苏门答腊社会愿望传达委员会”的组织曾经在28日举行会议，决定派巨港市长阿里·阿明等人为代表，到雅加达去会见总统、总理和内政部长，表达他们的愿望。这个委员会曾经通过决议要求实施广泛的以县、市为重点的“名符其实的自治”，由一个“合法的委员会”负责实施，经费自南苏门答腊地区筹集。
    南苏门答腊地方当局曾经在24日下令禁止携带五千盾以上现款出境，并且停止上缴税款给中央政府。印度尼西亚内政部长曾经表示，这是不合法的。
