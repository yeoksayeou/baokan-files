Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 13th: On January 11th, an old man who can use steel needles to treat cattle diseases attended the Sichuan Province's 1956 Representative Conference of Advanced Producers (Workers) in Agriculture, Forestry, Water Conservancy, and Meteorology Systems.

This old man is named Li Shutang, sixty-eight years old, and is a member of the Nineteenth Agricultural Cooperative of Ganlin Township, Five Village, Jiajiang County.

Li Shutang's method of treating cattle diseases with steel needles is called "Tendon Examination Therapy," and the treatment principle is the same as the "Acupuncture Therapy" of traditional Chinese medicine. He can perform acupuncture on twenty-two acupoints on the cow's nose tip, bridge of the nose, back, limbs, and hypochondrium to treat many diseases such as throat infection, mange, tail-wagging lameness, turning lameness, bloat, and postpartum cold, with very good treatment results.

Two months ago, a cow from the Five-Star Agricultural Cooperative in Jiajiang County suffered from falling sickness and rolled on the ground for four days. The owner thought there was no hope of saving it. The agricultural cooperative invited Li Shutang, who spent only one hour performing acupuncture on the twenty-two acupoints on the cow's body and applying medicine, and the cow's illness was completely cured.

Li Shutang has more than 40 years of experience in treating cattle diseases with acupuncture. Under the education of the Party and the government, Li Shutang announced his secret recipe in 1950 and has taught more than 140 apprentices in Jiajiang County.

    用针刺法治疗耕牛疾病
    四川夹江县李树堂公布秘方
    据新华社成都13日电　1月11日，一位能用钢针治疗耕牛疾病的老人，出席了四川省1956年农业、林业、水利、气象系统先进生产（工作）者代表会议。
    这位老人名叫李树堂，六十八岁，是夹江县甘霖乡五村第十九农业社的社员。
    李树堂用钢针治疗耕牛疾病的方法，叫做“审筋疗法”，治疗的原理和中医“针灸疗法”相同。他能在耕牛的鼻端、鼻梁、背上、四肢和胁下等处二十二个穴位，进行针刺，治疗牛的杀喉疥杆疯、腰痛下尾疯、转软疯、鼓胀病、产后寒等许多疾病，治疗效果很好。
    在两个月以前，夹江县五星农业社的一头耕牛患了倒地疯，在地上滚了四天，牛的主人以为没有救了。农业社请来了李树堂，他只用一个钟头的时间，在牛身上的二十二个穴位针刺，并敷了药，牛的病就完全好了。
    李树堂用针刺的方法治牛病，有四十多年的经验。在党和政府教育下，李树堂在1950年公布了秘方，并且在夹江县先后教会了一百四十多个徒弟。
