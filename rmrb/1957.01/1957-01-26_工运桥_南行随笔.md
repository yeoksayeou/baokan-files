    The Workers' Movement Bridge
    ——Notes from a Southern Journey
    Li Gao
    Wuxi is a city that makes people nostalgic. It attracts countless tourists because Taihu Lake is truly beautiful! However, what makes me particularly nostalgic is that it has become a modern industrial city—it has more than 100,000 workers and a glorious history of revolutionary struggle. Here, I do not want to describe the beautiful scenery: the magnificent peaks, lakes, and buildings; nor do I have the ability to describe its long history of struggle and the people who are vigorously building socialism. I just want to talk about the story of a bridge.
    As soon as we walked out of Wuxi Railway Station, we faced a cement bridge. This bridge is a vital artery of Wuxi City, a hub for Wuxi City's intake and output. However, its appearance is nothing special. There are probably ten or eight bridges of this shape in Wuxi City. What made me notice it was the three large characters "Workers' Movement Bridge" engraved on the bridge pier. Why is it called Workers' Movement Bridge? I thought, probably because it was named after socialist industrial construction? But looking closely at the bridge beams, piers, and handwriting, it doesn't seem to have been built in recent years. When was it built and why was it named "Workers' Movement Bridge"? This makes it difficult to figure out. I asked a local comrade, and he only said that it was said to have been called "Dayang Bridge" before, and later renamed this; that was a long, long time before liberation, so few people know about its origins.
    I visited Comrade Huang Huilan, the vice chairman of the Wuxi Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. I already knew that she was an old comrade with more than 40 years of work experience and grew up in this city. People call her Sister Huang. She is already 64 years old. Her temples are already gray, and her face is covered with wrinkles, but her body is tall and strong, and she does not look that old. She personally participated in the construction of the Workers' Movement Bridge.
    I asked her to talk about the history of the Workers' Movement Bridge.
    "The Workers' Movement Bridge was built in 1928," she said. I could see that this aroused deep memories in her. Yes, almost thirty years have passed! Thirty years is not a short time. "Fifty years ago, there wasn't even a factory here," she extended, "Wuxi opened its first silk weaving factory in 1907, and there were industrial workers here; only with workers could there be a workers' movement, and only then could there be a Workers' Movement Bridge. This must be told from the beginning."
    She smiled victoriously and looked at me. These words attracted me even more. Imagine that in 1928, it was the era of white terror when the Kuomintang reactionaries were in power. Just the fact that they were able to build this bridge named "Workers' Movement Bridge" was not a simple matter. I listened quietly to her narration. She talked about their painful lives, their strikes, the suppression by the Kuomintang reactionaries' army... Her voice and expression were sometimes filled with grief and indignation, and sometimes revealed victorious excitement. This is an energetic old woman.
    She started by talking about her time as a child laborer. When she was nine years old, Wuxi suffered a major flood. She went to Shanghai with her aunt and worked as a child laborer in an Italian silk weaving factory. Soon, because she could not understand the foreigner's words, she was beaten and cried in pain while stroking her wounds. She said: "I would rather die in my hometown than die in the hands of foreigners!" In this way, she returned home to row boats and farm. However, the family only rented three acres and eight points of land from the landlord, how could it be enough for the whole family to live on? When she was fifteen years old, Wuxi opened its first silk weaving factory, and she went to work in the factory as a child laborer again. She thought that this was a Chinese factory, and it would be better than a foreign factory. But she was completely wrong. When work was busy, capitalists forced workers to work more than thirteen hours. When there was not enough raw materials, workers could only get four hours of wages. Moreover, the number of factories opened in Wuxi increased day by day, and capitalists competed to exploit workers, working hours continued to lengthen, wages continued to decline, and workers lived in a half-dead state. In order to survive, in 1923, under the impetus of the nationwide workers' movement, the workers of Wuxi launched the first major strike demanding increased wages. By 1925, the Communist Party sent its own members, who propagated the truth of the working class in night schools and trade unions, and organized workers to rise up to fight against imperialism, feudalism, and for their own right to survival. Who knew that the Kuomintang reactionaries, contrary to their own promises, publicly arrested and brutally murdered Qin Qi, a 22-year-old mechanical worker and responsible comrade of the Communist Party in Wuxi, at a workers' rally! This aroused the anger of the workers. In 1927, a larger-scale workers' strike broke out, but what followed was an even more cruel white terror, with large numbers of workers being arrested and killed. However, the Party and the working class did not stop fighting, but only went underground. The Party sent Comrade Chen Peisan from Shanghai to take over the work left by Comrade Qin Qi. Comrade Huang Huilan said it well, the worker brothers and sisters were like headless ducks at that time, not knowing where to go. Fortunately, Comrade Chen Peisan arrived and pointed out the way for everyone. At this time, the Party adopted clever methods of struggle, using night schools, reading clubs, and various forms to organize and educate workers. It was also at this time that, in order to carry out larger-scale struggles and to educate the worker masses more widely, the Party proposed the plan to build the "Workers' Movement Bridge." The original Dayang Bridge was a narrow wooden bridge that was already dilapidated and looked like it was about to collapse. Every time a worker demonstration parade was held, it gathered near the railway station and passed over the bridge to enter the urban area. This was a necessary path to victory, and in order to ensure the safety of the marching team, it was proposed to rebuild Dayang Bridge into the Workers' Movement Bridge. From then on, a widespread publicity and fundraising campaign was launched. The workers enthusiastically responded to this call, tightened their belts to participate in the donation, and it was finally built.
    This is a bridge with commemorative significance, a bridge that encourages the people's struggle to move towards victory. The worker brothers who participated in the strikes and parades in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1935, and 1936 walked here; the staff sent by the Party came in and out from here; Comrade Chen Peisan and all the people who resisted Japan, who were released from the Kuomintang prison, walked from here to the anti-Japanese battlefield behind enemy lines; here, the footprints of the liaison personnel of the anti-Japanese base areas and the underground work in Wuxi were also left; the People's Liberation Army crossing the Yangtze River entered the urban area from this bridge; and the people who resisted America and aided Korea crossed it to board the train and go north. Now, thousands of people who are building socialism pass through this bridge every day, transporting in carloads of raw materials and transporting out carloads of finished products... It served the struggle in painful years, and now it is doing its best for the construction of socialism.
    When Comrade Huang Huilan talked about Comrades Qin Qi and Chen Peisan, her eyes turned red and her voice became low. I could not know exactly what she was thinking; but one thing I fully understood: this bridge was created by the blood of the martyrs! When we pass it, we will not forget the past of struggle, we will not forget Comrades Qin Qi, Chen Peisan, and the many, many people who shed their last drop of blood, who are sleeping in the Wuxi Martyrs' Park! They fell in order to build this bridge, for our today and a better tomorrow! And how happy we living people are, we have no reason not to do our best to defend it—this bridge of victory, the happy today, and a more brilliant tomorrow! Yes, I understood the feelings of this old man full of strong emotions; we will not let her and our martyrs down! ...

    工运桥
    ——南行随笔
    立高
    无锡是一座使人留恋的城市。它吸引着无数游客，因为太湖实在是太美丽了！但是，它所以使我特别留恋的，还因为它已经变成了一座近代化的工业城市——它有十万以上的工人，有光荣的革命斗争历史。在这里，我不想描写那些美丽的风景：绮丽的山峰、湖水、建筑；也没有能力描写出它长期所经历的斗争，和轰轰烈烈建设着社会主义的人们。我只想谈谈一座桥的故事。
    我们一走出无锡车站，就面对着一座水泥桥。这桥是无锡市的一个咽喉，是无锡市吞吐的一个枢纽。但是，它的外形并没有什么特别，像这样形状的桥，在无锡市总有十座八座；它所以使我注意，是因为桥桩上刻着“工运桥”三个大字。它为什么叫工运桥？我想，大概是因为进行社会主义的工业建设而命名的吧？可是细看那桥梁、桥桩、字迹，不像是近年修建的。它修建在何时、为什么命名做“工运桥”？这就叫人难于捉摸了。我询问当地的一个同志，他只说，据说它以前叫“大洋桥”，后来改称此名；那是在解放以前很久很久的事了，所以，关于它的始末很少有人知道。
    我去访问了无锡市总工会副主席黄惠兰同志。我早已知道，她是有四十多年工龄的老同志，是生长在这个城市里的。人都称她黄大姐。她已有六十四岁的高龄。她的两鬓已经斑白，脸上也刻满了皱纹，然而她的身体高大、健壮，看上去似乎没有那样大的年纪。她是亲自参加修建工运桥的一个。
    我请她谈谈工运桥的历史。
    “工运桥修建在1928年。”她说。我看出来这引动了她深深的回忆。是呀，屈指算来将近三十年了！三十年，可不是一个短暂的时间。“在五十年以前，这里连一座工厂也没有，”她又向前引伸说，“1907年无锡开办了第一座丝织厂，这里才有了产业工人；有了工人才有工人运动，这才有了工运桥。这必须从头说起。”
    她胜利地微笑了一下，望着我。这些话更吸引了我。试想1928年，正是国民党反动派当权的白色恐怖时代，就单拿能修建起这座命名为“工运桥”的事实，就不是很简单的了。我静听着她的叙述。她谈着他们的痛苦生活，谈着他们的罢工，国民党反动派军队的镇压……她的声音和表情一忽儿悲愤激昂，一忽儿又透露出胜利的兴奋。这是个精力充沛的老人。
    她打她做童工时讲起。在她九岁那年，无锡遭了大水灾，她跟她舅妈到了上海，在一家意大利的丝织厂做了童工。不久，因为听不懂鬼子的话而被毒打，她抚摸着自己的创伤痛哭了。她说：“死也死在家乡，绝不死在外国人手里！”这样，她又回家撑船、务农。可是家中只租种地主三亩八分地，怎么够全家生活？她十五岁上，无锡开办了第一家丝织厂，她又做为童工进厂了。她想，这是中国人的工厂，总会比外国人好些。可是她完全想错了。活忙时，资本家逼工人做十三个小时以上的工作，原料不足时，工人只能拿到四个小时的工资；而且无锡开办的工厂一天天加多，资本家竞相对工人进行压榨，工时不断加长，工资不断下降，工人们生活在半死不活的境况里。为了生存，1923年，无锡的工人在全国工人运动高潮的推动下，爆发了第一次要求增加工资的大罢工。到了1925年，共产党派来了自己的党员，他们在夜校、在工会，宣传着工人阶级的真理，组织工人起来为反帝反封建，以及为自己生存的权利而斗争。谁知国民党反动派，一反自己的诺言，竟将无锡共产党的负责同志、二十二岁的械机工人秦起，在一个工人的集会上公开逮捕，而残酷地杀害了！这激起了工人们的愤怒。1927年爆发了更大规模的工人罢工，但接着到来的是更加残酷的白色恐怖，成批的工人被逮捕、被杀害。但党和工人阶级并没有停止斗争，只是转入地下活动罢了。党从上海派来陈佩三同志来接替秦起同志所留下的工作。黄惠兰同志说得好，工人兄弟姐妹们，当时成了无头鸭子似的，不知向哪里去，幸好陈佩三同志到来，给大家指出了道路。党在这时采取了巧妙的斗争方法，利用夜校、读书会，各种各样的形式，组织教育工人。也就是在这时，党为了进行更大规模的斗争，为了更广泛地教育工人群众，提出了修建“工运桥”的计划。原来的大洋桥是一个窄窄的木板桥，已经破旧不堪，眼看就要塌陷了。每一次工人示威游行，都是集合在车站附近，从桥上通过进入市区。这是一个走向胜利的必经之路，为了游行队伍的安全，提出改建大洋桥为工运桥。从此展开了广泛地宣传募捐工作。工人们踊跃地响应了这个号召，勒紧自己的腰带参加捐献，它终于建成了。
    这是一座有纪念意义的桥，是一座鼓舞人民斗争走向胜利的桥。1930、1931、1932、1935、1936年的罢工游行的工人弟兄们，是从这里走过的；党派来的工作人员是从这里进出的；从国民党监狱释放出来的陈佩三等同志和一切抗日的人们，从这里走上敌后抗日的战场；这里，也留下了敌后根据地和无锡的地下工作联络人员的足迹；横渡长江的人民解放军从这座桥上进入市区；抗美援朝的人们跨过它登上火车北上。现在，每日有成千成万建设社会主义的人们在这座桥上通过，运进成车的原料，运出成车的成品。……它在痛苦的年月中为斗争服务，现在又为建设社会主义而尽着自己的力量。
    黄惠兰同志谈到秦起和陈佩三同志的时候，眼圈红了，声音也低沉了下来。她究竟在想着什么，我不能确切地知道；但有一点我是完全理解到了：这座桥是先烈们的鲜血所造成的！当我们走过它的时候，我们不会忘记那斗争的过去，不会忘记长眠在无锡烈士公园的秦起、陈佩三等同志，以及那许许多多洒尽了自己最后一滴血的人们！他们为了修造这座桥，为了我们的今天和更美好的明天倒下了！而我们活着的人们，有多么幸福，我们没有理由不用全力来保卫它——这座胜利之桥、幸福的今天，和更加灿烂的明天！是的，我体会到了这个饱含着强烈感情的老年人的心情；我们不会辜负她，以及我们的先烈！……
