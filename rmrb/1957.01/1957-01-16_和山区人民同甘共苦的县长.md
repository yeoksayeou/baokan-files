    "Is County Head Ni unaware of how to spend money? Or what's the deal…." Several young service personnel of the Miyun County People's Committee constantly muttered and speculated like this. In their daily interactions with the thirty-something County Head and Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, Comrade Ni Jieyu, these young people seemed to disapprove of certain things.

    They knew exactly how many sets of clothes County Head Ni had; they could count them clearly. All of them were made of cloth, and mostly plain cloth. He was still wearing the old Qing Shi cloth overcoat he had made three years ago.

    Sometimes they praised him: it's so easy to serve such a leader. He doesn't even drink tea on ordinary days, and only buys a bag of tea when guests come, the best being third-grade. In recent years, who has ever seen County Head Ni eat a meal in a restaurant? Sometimes when he returns from an outing and misses the meal in the agency canteen, he buys at most two fried dough cakes on the street.

    They also figured out one of the county head's habits: he had to maximize the utilization rate of everything he used. One day, the sun had set, and Comrade Ni Jieyu was still working with his head down. The service personnel lit the kerosene lamp for him, but he said: I can still see, it's better to light it later. The cooks often said: County Head Ni's used rice bowl is easy to wash, not a single grain of rice is left at the bottom of the bowl.

    They also had things they dreaded: every morning, as soon as the wake-up bell rang, the service personnel would rush around, and the earliest to rise often lagged behind Comrade Ni Jieyu. When they went to deliver water to him, he had already finished washing up and was sitting there, either reading or writing. The service personnel were often very embarrassed. At this time, Comrade Ni Jieyu would earnestly tell them: It's not early, don't worry about me, go to school quickly!

    These things were most deeply felt by the service personnel. Many cadres in county-level agencies also had things they had seen and heard, and there were discussions: some said Comrade Ni Jieyu still maintained the fine tradition of frugality of the Eighth Route Army; some said County Head Ni couldn't keep up with the times and was looking backward. However, no matter how people discussed it, when the various departments and bureaus were drafting work plans related to financial expenditure or the use of manpower and materials, they often first thought about whether the plan would be approved if it was sent to the county head for review? So they considered it again and again, and tightened it again and again.

    Comrade Ni Jieyu always compared his own life with the lives of the people, and the result was "already much higher." He also wondered if doing so was "stingy" or "looking backward"? No, although the lives of the masses were much better than in the past, scenes of difficulties often appeared before his eyes, and this was the basis for his handling of many issues in his personal life and work. Once, his wife repeatedly advised him to buy a pair of soft-leather shoes, but he still bought a pair of thick-soled cloth shoes. He said that they were sturdy and cheap, and good for walking mountain roads in the countryside! The service personnel, Xiao Dan, secretly remembered this matter, and whenever it was mentioned, he would say: Look, what our county head thinks about all day long is going up the mountain.

    Yes, among the county-level responsible cadres in Miyun County, Ni Jieyu was the one who went to the countryside the most times and for the longest periods, far exceeding the regulations of the higher authorities. The term "going to the countryside" here means climbing mountains. If it can be said that the entire Miyun County is on the mountains, it is not an exaggeration. Especially when County Head Ni went to the countryside, he was willing to go to the deep mountains in the north, where the mountains were even higher and more numerous. Not to mention riding a bicycle, even walking required extra caution.

    Last year, in May, Potou Village was still not warm, and people still had to wear cotton clothes in the early morning and evening. Ni Jieyu and his party went there in single-layer clothing, and the mountain wind made them feel even colder. This village of more than one hundred and thirty households, when viewed from the top of the mountain, had clusters of houses scattered at their feet. It would not be easy to visit each one; the area was a good sixty li in circumference. They ran into the mountain rings, drilled into the mountain gullies, visited the local people's production and living conditions, and also consulted with the old sheep herders on the mountain, held discussion meetings, systematically summarized the experience of raising and managing sheep in this area, and promoted it throughout the county. On the day they left the village, the continuous drizzle did not stop, and the village cadres and the masses repeatedly tried to persuade them to stay, but they still set off according to the established work plan. The only way to get to Yaoqiaoyu Village was to cross the "Zou Ma'an" mountain ridge. This so-called mountain ridge was actually a group of mountains piled together, with one peak rising after another. The mountain was steep and difficult to climb. Ni Jieyu's bulky body would be more tired than others, but he mostly walked in front, constantly encouraging everyone to climb up. They went up the ridge after breakfast and walked all day, not reaching Yaoqiaoyu until dusk. At this time, the raincoats outside were soaked, and the clothes inside were also soaked with sweat. After dinner, they quickly threw themselves into new work.

    On July 23 last year, the County People's Committee suddenly received information that Fanzipai, Yushudi and other villages had suffered from a hailstorm. The heavy rain that had lasted for several days had just stopped, and Comrade Ni Jieyu and several cadres set off together. They took relief funds to the disaster area to express their condolences and help the local people arrange production. The first day they traveled eighty li and stayed in Fengjiayu. The next morning, they set off early again. It had just rained, and there were mountain rivers with rapid water and many stones everywhere. After walking more than ten li, they had to wade through thirty or so streams. "Disaster relief is like fighting a fire," they were anxious, and the road was difficult. Ni Jieyu's feet were already worn out in many places, but he still walked forward forcefully. They arrived at Fanzipai Village when the sun was setting, and without stopping, they went to inspect the disaster situation and express their condolences to the people. Together with the commune cadres, they mobilized the commune members to rush to plant buckwheat and develop sideline occupations such as digging medicinal materials, and the masses' enthusiasm for production quickly rose again.

    Ni Jieyu has been working in such mountainous areas for more than ten years. He has traveled almost every mountain in the deep mountainous areas of northern Miyun County, and he knows very well what each mountain produces and what is suitable for development. As the years he spent working in the mountainous areas increased, he realized more and more that the content of work in the mountainous areas was rich and colorful. He didn't want to hear anyone say "poor mountain ditch." According to him, the cities and plains could not do without the products of the mountainous areas for their food, clothing, housing, and use. The mountainous areas not only had to meet the needs of the people of the country, but also had many products to export. He insisted on going to the deep mountainous areas more often. He had personally seen that the villages in this area had been burned by the enemy five to twelve times, and that they had more difficulties in production and life and that transportation was inconvenient. Therefore, he advocated that the cadres in the county should often go and take a look.

    To welcome the county head, the village cadres and the masses in the mountainous areas often had excessive worries: where should the county head stay? What should he eat? Ni Jieyu understood this feeling long ago. He knew that the housing in the mountainous areas was narrow, so at night, he often squeezed on the same kang with the villagers, chatting and sleeping. What to eat? If he was asked in advance, he would tell people: Steaming sweet potatoes and boiling sauerkraut cannot be eaten in the agencies, so such meals should be made. In fact, these were the meals that every household in the mountainous areas had. Once in Jinyu Village, a villager specially made him a meal of white rice, but he refused to eat it, and insisted on eating the same food as the villager, and let the white rice be left for the elderly and children to improve their lives. Ni Jieyu's every move was a great encouragement and comfort to the cadres and the masses in the mountainous areas. Just as the township head of Yushudi Township told people: The county head is like us, we must overcome all difficulties and build a beautiful mountainous area.

    和山区人民同甘共苦的县长
    叶树彬
    “倪县长是有钱不知道花？还是怎的……。”密云县人民委员会的几个年轻的服务员不断地这样念叨和猜测。这几个年轻人和这位三十多岁的县长、县委第二书记倪介瑜同志在日常相处中，似乎是对有些事情看不惯的。
    他们知道倪县长共计有几套衣服，一数就数得很清楚，都是布的，就是布的也多是平面布。到如今还披着三年前作的那件青士布小大衣。
    他们有时在赞许：遇到这样的首长真省事。平日连茶水都不喝，来了客人才让买袋茶叶，最高是三级的。几年来，谁见过倪县长到饭馆吃顿饭？有时外出回来，赶不上在机关食堂吃饭，至多到街上买两个油饼。
    他们也摸到了县长的一种习性；就是要把使的用的一切物品，都得发挥出最高的利用率。一天，太阳落了，倪介瑜同志仍在低着头办公，服务员给他点着了煤油灯，他却说：还可以看得见，以后再晚些点才好。炊事员们也常说：倪县长用过的饭碗，刷着也省事，碗底不剩一粒饭。
    他们也有怵头的事：每天早晨，一打起床钟，几个服务员紧赶一阵，起的最早的，还时常落在倪介瑜同志的后边。等给他送水去的时候，他早已洗刷完毕，坐在那里，不是看就是写。服务员常常为此闹个大红脸。这时，倪介瑜同志谆谆地告诉他们：天不早了，不要管我的事，快去上学吧！
    这些事情，几个服务员体会的最深刻。县级机关的许多干部也有所见所闻，也曾有议论：有的说倪介瑜同志还是八路军的那套俭朴的优良作风；有的说倪县长是不是赶不上时代，向后看了。但是，不管如何议论，各科、局在拟制有关财务开支或动用人力物力的工作计划时，常常先想到这项计划如果送给县长审查，能否被批准？于是考虑又考虑，紧缩再紧缩。
    倪介瑜同志总是把自己的生活和人民群众的生活比一比，结果是“已经高的多了”。他也想过这样做是不是“小气”或“向后看”了？不，群众的生活虽然比过去好多了，但是，一幕幕的困难景象，也常浮现在他的眼前，这就是他处理个人生活上、工作上许多问题的根据。有一次，他的爱人一再劝他应该买双皮底软帮鞋，他仍然买了双厚底粗布鞋。他说这结实便宜，下乡走山道可得劲啦！在一旁的服务员小单，暗自记住了这件事，一提起来，就说：你看，我们县长整天想的还不就是上山。
    是的，密云县的几个县级负责干部，倪介瑜是下乡工作次数最多时间最长的一个，远远超过了上级的规定。这里所说的下乡，也就是爬山。如果说整个密云县就在山上，那也未尝不可。尤其倪县长下乡，还愿意到北部的深山去，那山就更高更多了。别说骑自行车，就是步行，也得格外小心。
    去年，5月的坡头村，仍不暖和，一早一晚还得穿棉衣。倪介瑜等一行人是穿单衣去的，山风一旋，越觉寒气逼人。这个一百三十多户的村庄，站在山头望去，三三两两一丛丛的房舍尽在脚下，要是去串游一趟可不大容易，方圆整整有六十里地路程。他们跑进山环，钻到山沟，访问了当地群众的生产、生活情形，还到山上请教老羊工，召开座谈会，系统地总结了这一带饲养和管理羊群的经验，向全县推广了。当他们离开这村的那天，连绵的细雨下个不停，村干部和群众一再挽留，他们依然按照既定的工作计划出发了。到遥桥峪村必经“走马鞍”山梁。这说是一座山梁，实际是由许多山峰堆积一起的山群，一峰未过，一峰又起。山势陡立，步履艰难。倪介瑜同志那笨重的身体比别人会更累，可是他多是走在前边，不时地鼓励大家用力爬上去。他们从早饭后上梁，整整走了一天，日暮的时候才到了遥桥峪。这时，外边的雨衣淋透了，里边的衣服被汗水也浸透了。吃了晚饭，他们很快又投入了新的工作。
    去年7月23日，县人民委员会突然接到番字牌、榆树底等村一带遭受了雹灾的信息。连下了几天的大雨刚刚停止，倪介瑜同志和几个干部就一起出发了。他们带着救济款到灾区慰问和帮助当地群众安排生产。第一天赶了八十里路，宿在冯家峪。第二天一清早就又出发。刚下过雨，水急石多的山河到处都有，走十几里地，就要淌三十几道水。“救灾如救火”，心里急，路难走，倪介瑜同志的两只脚，早已磨破了多处，但他依然是有力地向前走去。到番字牌村太阳将落，没有住脚，就去察看灾情，慰问群众。他们和社干部一起发动社员抢种了荞麦，开展了刨药材等副业，群众的生产情绪很快又高涨起来了。
    就是在这样的山区，倪介瑜同志已经工作十几年了。他几乎跑遍了密云县北部深山地区的每一道山，那道山上产什么，适宜发展什么，他都了解得很清楚。随着他在山区工作年限的增长，他越发体会到山区的工作内容丰富多采。他不愿意听到有人说一句“穷山沟”。依他说来，城市和平原，吃的、穿的、住的和用的，那一样也离不开山区产的。山区不仅要满足本国人民需要，还有许多物产要出口。他坚持多到深山地区去，他亲眼看过这一带的村庄被敌人烧过五次到十二次之多，在生产、生活上困难较多，交通又不方便，因此，他主张县里的干部应该经常去看一看。
    山区的村干部和群众为欢迎县长，时常产生过分的忧虑：让县长住在那里？吃什么？这种心情早为倪介瑜同志所了解。他知道山区的住房狭窄，晚上，就常和老乡挤在一个坑上一边谈天，一边睡下了。吃什么饭？如果事前问一问他，他就告诉人们：蒸白薯、熬酸菜，是在机关里吃不到的，应该做这样的饭。其实这也就是山区家家都有的饭菜了。有一次在金沟屯，一户老乡特意给他做了顿白米饭，他终究不肯吃，争着和老乡吃一样的，让把白米饭留给老人、小孩改善生活。倪介瑜同志的一行一动，对山区的干部、群众是一个莫大的鼓舞和安慰。正像榆树底乡的乡长告诉人们说的：县长和我们一样，都是要克服一切困难，建设美好的山区。　（原载河北日报，本报略有删改）（附图片）
