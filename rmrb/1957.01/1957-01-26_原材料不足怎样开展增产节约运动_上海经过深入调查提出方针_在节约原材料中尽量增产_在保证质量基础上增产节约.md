Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 25th: After more than a month of investigation and deliberation, major industrial departments and key enterprises in Shanghai have initially explored several key aspects of carrying out the production increase and economy campaign this year. Currently, many enterprises are formulating production increase and economy plans, preparing to submit them to the workers' representative congress for discussion after the Spring Festival.

The main characteristic of this year's production increase and economy campaign in Shanghai's industrial departments is the emphasis on spending more time on in-depth investigation and full deliberation, changing the past practice of assigning production increase and economy targets level by level. After the Central Committee put forward the call to launch the production increase and economy campaign, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened symposiums of responsible persons from various industrial departments and key enterprises, requiring them to earnestly absorb past experiences and lessons and avoid formalistic practices.

Industrial leading departments and the Party's industrial work departments organized working groups with responsible personnel such as bureau chiefs and managers participating, going deep into factories, departments, and workshops to investigate and study. Some also convened symposiums for technical, financial, planning, and supply and marketing personnel, as well as workers, to understand the supply, production, and sales situation this year, summarize past experiences and lessons, find ways to increase production and economy, and understand the ideological sentiments of cadres and the masses. While conducting investigations and studies from top to bottom, Party organizations strengthened the publicity and education of the political situation and the national economic situation. Many factories also combined this with strengthening enterprise democratic management, organizing worker representatives to inspect work, and exploring the potential for increasing production and economy from bottom to top. In newly joint ventures, publicity and education on the redemption policy was carried out to raise the awareness of workers, and organizations for democratic management were being established and strengthened.

After investigation and deliberation, various industrial departments and many enterprises have gradually clarified the guidelines for carrying out the production increase and economy campaign this year. Due to the general trend that the supply of industrial products and raw materials cannot keep up with the needs, this year's policy is to strive to increase production while saving raw materials. At the same time, drawing lessons from the past tendency of some enterprises to neglect product quality in increasing production and economy, it is also emphasized that production increase and economy must be based on ensuring and improving quality. According to this policy, in formulating this year's production increase and economy plans, major industrial departments and enterprises are mostly paying attention to focusing on the following key aspects:

    Seeking Potential from Design

First, strengthen design work. After investigation and analysis, the design of many electromechanical products is currently very outdated, using a lot of materials, heavy in volume, and inefficient. The Shanghai Boiler Factory mobilized workers to collect more than 800 tons of scrap steel in September last year, achieving great results, but after a burst of activity, the campaign stagnated. Later, when the technical personnel of the departments were mobilized and started from technical transformation, the campaign became active again and achieved even greater results. The designers changed a three-drum boiler to a two-drum boiler, saving about 20 tons of steel per boiler. This year, they will continue to focus on reducing the weight of boilers as the key to improving design. It is estimated that for six types of boilers alone, more than 600 tons of steel can be saved this year. With the help of Soviet experts, the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory improved the design of the hydraulic components of the grinder, reducing the number of parts, reducing weight, and greatly saving processing time. The grinders produced this year will adopt this new design, which can save materials and man-hours worth about 600,000 yuan. As a result of reducing materials in the bed and other parts of another grinder, the materials used for every ten grinders can be used to make eleven grinders on average. This year, the same method will be adopted for three other types of grinders. In the light industry's rubber industry, after improving the design of automobile tires, tires that originally ran 30,000 kilometers can now run 60,000 kilometers. Many factories have found huge potential for increasing production and economy in the design stage.

    Paying Attention to Process Analysis

Second, strengthen process work. After investigation and analysis, many machinery factories in the past paid attention to the machine processing workshops in the production increase and economy campaign, focusing on promoting advanced experience in metal cutting, while neglecting the foundry and forging workshops and process design that create conditions for production increase and economy for the machine processing workshops. After analyzing the technological process of eleven kinds of petroleum machinery accessories, the Shanghai No. 1 Heavy Industry Bureau found that these eleven kinds of accessories can be designed with good molds, directly forged into finished products, and do not need to be machined anymore. According to this year's planned output, it can save more than 1,000 tons of precious alloy steel. Now many factories are preparing to start by improving the casting and forging process, so that many parts do not need cutting processing or minimize the margin of cutting processing, which can not only save a lot of metal, but also greatly save processing time. In machine processing workshops and other industrial enterprises, process analysis will also be carried out, absorbing advanced experience at home and abroad and the operating experience of workers in the factory, designing new tools and fixtures, and formulating new operating procedures that can save man-hours and ensure quality.

    Strengthening Raw Material Management

Third, strengthen raw material management. After investigation and analysis, the reason why many departments and enterprises waste raw materials is that there are many loopholes in management and use, using large materials for small purposes and using good materials for inferior purposes. The main measure of the textile department in saving raw materials is to gradually classify products and formulate different cotton mixing methods according to different uses. Good cotton is used to spin high-grade fabrics and export yarn; second-grade cotton is used to spin dark-colored printed cloth, bleached cloth, and lining cloth; and waste cotton is used to spin miscellaneous yarn and coarse yarn to increase the production of packaging cloth, sofa cloth, and coarse cotton cloth. The iron and steel department will also strengthen technical measures in mixing local iron, utilizing pig iron with high phosphorus and sulfur content, and using less scrap steel to overcome the difficulties of raw materials. The machinery department will strictly implement the quota management of material distribution and recycling, and at the same time study substitutes for precious metals.

    Adjusting Organizational Structure

Fourth, adjusting the organizational structure. After investigation and analysis, the departments in state-owned and old joint ventures are too finely divided. Large factories have one or twenty departments, and workshops have many functional groups accordingly. The number of management personnel and non-production personnel in new joint ventures has also increased a lot. All levels of organizations are bloated, with overlapping levels, and superiors take over the work of subordinates, resulting in a disaster of reports and meetings. This year, various industrial departments will combine the study of enterprise system issues to conduct reasonable division of labor and merge some departments. The textile department has decided that textile factories with only single spinning and weaving workshops of medium size will cancel the workshop-level organization.

Various industrial departments will continue to deeply develop the advanced producer movement in the production increase and economy campaign. Commend the advanced, summarize and promote advanced experience, pay attention to mobilizing department personnel, and consider formulating more reasonable evaluation and reward methods.

    原材料不足怎样开展增产节约运动
    上海经过深入调查提出方针
    在节约原材料中尽量增产　在保证质量基础上增产节约
    新华社上海25日电　经过一个多月的调查和酝酿，上海一些主要的工业部门和重点企业，已经初步地摸索到今年开展增产节约运动的几个主要环节。目前，许多企业正在制定增产节约计划，准备在春节以后，提交职工代表大会讨论。
    这次上海工业部门准备增产节约运动的主要特点，是强调以较多的时间进行深入调查和充分酝酿，改变了过去逐级分配增产节约任务数字的做法。中共上海市委员会在中央提出开展增产节约运动的号召以后，曾经分别召开各工业部门和重点企业负责人的座谈会，要求他们认真吸取过去的经验教训，避免形式主义的做法。
    工业领导部门同党的工业工作部门，组织了有局长、经理等负责人员参加的工作组，深入到工厂、科室、车间去调查研究。有的还分别召开了技术、财务、计划、供销人员和工人座谈会，摸索今年供产销情况，总结过去经验教训，寻找增产节约环节，了解干部群众思想情绪。在从上而下调查研究的同时，党的组织加强了政治形势和国家经济情况的宣传教育。许多厂还同加强企业民主管理的工作结合起来，组织职工代表检查工作，自下而上地发掘增产节约的潜力。在新合营企业中，进行赎买政策的宣传教育，提高职工的觉悟，并且着手建立和加强民主管理的组织。
    经过调查和酝酿，各个工业部门和许多企业对今年开展增产节约运动的方针已经逐步明确起来。由于工业品的供应和原材料的供应都赶不上需要的总趋势，今年的方针是在节约原材料中尽量增产。同时，吸取过去有些企业在增产节约中忽视产品质量的偏向，又强调必须在保证质量和提高质量的基础上增产节约。根据这个方针，一些主要的工业部门和企业在制定今年的增产节约计划中，大都注意到着重抓以下几个主要的环节：
    从设计上寻找潜力
    首先是加强设计工作。经过调查分析，目前有不少机电产品的设计是很陈旧的，用料多、体积重、效率不高。上海锅炉厂在去年9月份发动职工收集了八百多吨废钢铁，取得很大成绩，但是“轰”了一阵以后，运动就停滞了。以后科室技术人员发动起来，从改造技术着手，运动又活跃起来，取得了更大成绩。设计人员把一种三汽包锅炉改为两汽包，每台锅炉少用了约二十吨钢铁。今年他们将继续以减轻锅炉体重作为改进设计的重点，估计仅六种锅炉，今年就能节约六百多吨钢铁。上海机床厂在苏联专家帮助下改进了磨床液压部件的设计，零件减少、重量减轻，加工工时也大大节省，今年生产的磨床都采用这种新设计，可以节省价值六十万元左右的材料和工时。另一种磨床在床身等方面减少用料的结果，平均每十台磨床的用料可以造十一台，今年将对另外三种磨床采用同样的方法。轻工业中的橡胶工业，在改进了汽车轮胎的设计以后，原来走三万公里的轮胎可以走六万公里。许多工厂都在设计的环节上找出了巨大的增产节约潜力。
    注意进行工艺分析
    第二是加强工艺工作。经过调查分析，许多机械工厂过去在增产节约运动中注意抓机械加工车间，着重推广金属切削的先进经验，而忽视为机械加工车间创造增产节约条件的铸工、锻压车间和工艺设计。上海市第一重工业局在分析了十一种石油机械配件的工艺过程以后，发现这十一种配件都可以设计好模子，直接锻打为成品，无须再进行机械加工；以今年的计划产量计算，因此可以节约一千几百吨贵重的合金钢。现在许多工厂都准备从改进浇铸、锻压的工艺着手，使许多零件不需切削加工或尽量减少切削加工的余量，这不仅可以节约大量金属，而且还可以大大节约加工时间。在机械加工车间和其他工业企业中，也将进行工艺分析，吸取国内外先进经验和本厂工人的操作经验，设计新的工具夹具，订出能节省工时、保证质量的新的操作规程。
    加强原材料管理
    第三是加强原材料管理工作。经过调查分析，目前许多部门和企业原材料所以浪费，是因为在管理和使用等方面存在着很多漏洞，大材小用、优材劣用。纺织部门在节约原材料方面的主要措施，就是把产品逐步实行分类，根据不同用途拟定不同的配棉方法，好的棉花纺制高级织物和出口纱布；较次的棉花纺制深色印花布、漂白布、夹里布；下脚棉花纺制杂牌纱和粗支纱，用来增产包装布、沙发布和粗棉布。钢铁部门也将在掺用土铁、利用含磷含硫较高的生铁和少用废钢等方面加强技术措施，克服原材料的困难。机械部门将严格执行发料、回收的定额管理，同时研究贵重金属的代用品。
    调整组织机构
    第四是组织机构的调整。经过调查分析，目前国营、老合营工厂科室分工太细，大厂都有一二十个科室，车间也相应的有许多职能组。新合营厂管理人员和非生产人员也增加很多。各级机构臃肿、层次重叠，上级包办下级工作，报表和会议成灾。各工业部门今年将结合企业体制问题的研究，进行合理分工，合并一些科室。纺织部门已经决定凡规模中等的只有单一的纺纱和织布工场的纺织厂，取消工场一级组织。
    各个工业部门在增产节约运动中将继续深入开展先进生产者运动。表扬先进，总结推广先进经验，注意发动科室人员，并且将考虑制定更合理的评比奖励办法。
