Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Wang Hui, a driver at the Zhangzhou Maintenance Station of the Fujian Provincial Transportation Bureau, had safely driven 300,000 kilometers by the end of last year.

    Wang Hui has been driving safely for more than 2,500 days since he started working in 1950. When driving, he pays close attention to the surrounding environment and road conditions. Before driving, he always carefully checks the machine parts, and gets out of the car to check them every 30 or 40 kilometers. After each task is completed, he always maintains the car before resting.

    Recently, the competent authorities rewarded Wang Hui and another one hundred and thirteen car drivers who had safely driven more than 100,000 kilometers.
