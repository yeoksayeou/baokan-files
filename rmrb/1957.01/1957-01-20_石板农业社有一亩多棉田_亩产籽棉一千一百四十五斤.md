    The Shiban Agricultural Cooperative Has More Than One Mu of Cotton Field
    Per-Mu Yield of 1,145 Jin of Seed Cotton
    (Our newspaper reports) The Shiban Agricultural Cooperative in Hezuo Township, Jingshan County, Hubei Province, harvested 1,225 jin of seed cotton from a cotton field of one mu and seven li last year, yielding a total of 467 jin and 10 liang of ginned cotton. The average per-mu yield was 1,145 jin of seed cotton and 437 jin and 4 liang of ginned cotton, creating a new record of high cotton yield in the province.
    The reason this cotton field was able to achieve such a high yield was mainly due to the use of the superior Daizi cotton seeds that had been fumigated and treated with Ceresan; before sowing, meticulous cultivation and sufficient base fertilizer were applied; the sowing time was advanced by half a month compared to the previous year, and strip planting with close spacing was adopted; after sowing, topdressing was carried out five times according to the cotton's growth, and pests were controlled seven times. As a result of adopting the above series of technical measures, the cotton buds consistently grew neatly and vigorously, and the cotton bolls were numerous and large.
    In order to promote the cooperative's experience in high cotton yield, the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Provincial Agricultural Exhibition have successively sent specialists to the cooperative to conduct technical summaries and collect exhibits. The Jingshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Committee are also preparing to reward them. (Jingshan Newspaper Editorial Department)

    石板农业社有一亩多棉田
    亩产籽棉一千一百四十五斤
    本报讯　湖北省京山县合作乡石板农业社，去年在一块一亩零七厘的棉田里，收籽棉一千二百二十五斤，共轧皮棉四百六十七斤十两，平均亩产籽棉一千一百四十五斤，亩产皮棉四百三十七斤四两，创造了全省棉花高额丰产的新纪录。
    这块棉田所以能获得这样高的产量，主要是使用了经过熏蒸的岱字棉良种，并经过了赛力散药剂拌种；在播种前，进行了精耕细作，施足底肥；播种的时间，比前年提早了半个月，又采用了条播密植；播种后，根据棉花生长的情形，进行了五次追肥，并防治了七次虫害。由于采取了如上一系列的技术措施，所以棉蕾始终长得整齐健壮、棉桃结得又多又大。
    为了推广这个社的棉花丰产经验，湖北省农业厅、省农业展览会，已先后派专人到这个社进行了技术总结和收集展品。中共京山县委会和县人民委员会，还准备予以奖励。　（京山报编辑部）
