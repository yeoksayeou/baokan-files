Great Development of Health Services in Minority Areas of Guizhou Province

(Our Dispatch) The health services and sanitation conditions have greatly improved in the counties of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, the Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, and the Weining Yi, Hui and Miao Autonomous County in Guizhou Province.

Frequently occurring acute infectious diseases in minority areas include smallpox, relapsing fever, and dysentery. Smallpox has now been eradicated due to widespread vaccination; relapsing fever will also be essentially eliminated. Dysentery is the most harmful and widespread. In recent years, dysentery prevention and treatment stations and health and epidemic prevention stations have been established in counties with high incidence of dysentery to investigate and prevent the disease. Now the incidence of dysentery has been greatly reduced.

In 1950, there were only two county health centers with fifteen beds and five health technicians in minority areas throughout the province. By 1956, the health services in minority areas had greatly developed, with two autonomous prefecture hospitals, thirty county people's hospitals, one hundred and seventy-six district health centers, fifty-four maternal and child health stations, two mobile medical teams, and six hundred and forty-one beds. In addition, fifty-three joint clinics were organized, and one thousand one hundred and ninety-nine health rooms were established to help agricultural production cooperatives. In order to facilitate medical treatment for the masses, many mobile medical teams were organized to conduct treatment in minority villages. Free medical treatment is provided for those with economic difficulties. According to statistics from twenty-one counties, including Dushan and Zhenyuan, in the first half of 1956, there were more than 220,000 free outpatient visits and more than 4,000 free hospitalizations. The number of outpatient visits was five times the number of outpatient visits in minority areas in 1950, and the number of hospitalizations was more than ten times that of 1950.

Maternal and child health work in minority areas has also made progress. In recent years, more than 8,000 minority midwives have been trained, and the number of minority women accepting modern midwifery is increasing every year. In some counties, modern midwifery has reached more than 80%. This has greatly reduced maternal and infant mortality rates.

In order to train medical personnel from minority ethnic groups, from 1950 to 1955, secondary health professional schools enrolled 483 minority students, and 216 students graduated. In 1956, there were a total of 480 minority students in school. (Xia Xunyan)

    贵州省少数民族地区
    卫生事业有很大发展
    本报讯　贵州省黔南布依族苗族自治州、黔东南苗族侗族自治州所属各县和威宁彝族回族苗族自治县的卫生事业有了很大发展，卫生状况有了改善。
    在少数民族地区经常出现的急性传染病有天花、回归热、痢疾等。现在天花因普遍接种牛痘已绝迹；回归热也将基本消灭；痢疾危害最烈，分布最广，几年来，先后在痢疾发病较多的县建立痢疾防治站和卫生防疫站，对痢疾进行了调查防治工作，现在痢疾发病率已大大降低。
    1950年全省少数民族地区仅有县卫生院二所、病床十五张，卫生技术人员五人。到1956年，少数民族地区的卫生事业有了很大的发展，拥有自治州医院二所，县人民医院三十所，区卫生所一百七十六个，妇幼保健站五十四个，巡回医疗队二个，病床六百四十一张。另外还组织了联合诊所五十三个，帮助农业生产合作社建立保健室一千一百九十九个。为了便利群众治病，还组织了很多巡回医疗组，深入少数民族聚居村寨进行治疗。对于经济困难者，实行免费治疗。据1956年上半年独山、镇远等二十一个县统计，免费门诊达二十二万余人次，免费住院四千多人。门诊人次为1950年少数民族地区门诊人次的五倍，住院人次为1950年的十倍多。
    少数民族地区的妇幼卫生工作也有进展。几年来训练了少数民族接生员八千多人，接受新法接生的少数民族妇女：每年都有增加。有的县新法接生已达80％以上。这就大大降低了产妇、婴儿死亡率。
    为了培养少数民族自己的医务人员，1950年至1955年，中等卫生专业学校招收了少数民族学生四百八十三人，毕业学生二百一十六人，1956年少数民族在校学生共有四百八十人。　（夏训炎）
