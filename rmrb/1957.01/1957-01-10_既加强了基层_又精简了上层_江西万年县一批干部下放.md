    Strengthening the Grassroots and Streamlining the Upper Levels
    A Batch of Cadres from Wannian County, Jiangxi Province, Transferred Downwards
    (Our dispatch) In order to strengthen the leadership force of grassroots organizations, the Wannian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangxi Province recently transferred a batch of county-level cadres to serve as general branch secretaries or township heads in various townships. Among them were one county committee member, three county committee department heads, and fourteen former district committee secretaries and district heads who had been transferred to the county to serve as department heads, deputy bureau chiefs, and managers of various departments during the merging of districts and townships. All twenty-five townships in the county now have three to five district-level cadres each. This transfer of cadres has particularly strengthened the leadership force in the marginal mountain areas and townships with lagging work. Each of these townships has a county-level cadre serving as general branch secretary.
    This approach not only strengthens the grassroots forces but also overcomes the problem of overstaffing in county-level agencies. For example, the county has very little industry, and the County Party Committee's Industry Department has had little work to do for a long time. This time, the head of the Industry Department was transferred to the countryside, and the Industry Department was merged with the Finance and Trade Department. Other departments, such as the Rural Work Department and the Grain Bureau, have two to three department heads and bureau chiefs. Transferring one or two department heads and bureau chiefs to the countryside will not affect the original work at all.
    The cadres who have already been transferred took up their new posts successively on January 7th. They expressed their intention to settle down and build a career in the countryside. Currently, they are primarily assisting the agricultural cooperatives in their respective locations to do a good job in consolidating the cooperatives and preparing for next year's production.

### 既加强了基层　又精简了上层  江西万年县一批干部下放

    既加强了基层　又精简了上层
    江西万年县一批干部下放
    本报讯　为了充实基层组织的领导力量，中共江西万年县委最近抽调一批县级干部去担任各乡的总支书记或乡长。其中有县委委员一名、县委部长三名和撤区并乡时调到县上担任各部门正副局长、经理的区委书记和区长十四名。全县二十五个乡现在每乡都有三至五名区级干部。这次下放的干部特别加强了边缘山区和工作落后地区各乡的领导力量。这些乡每乡都有一个县级干部担任总支书记。
    这样作，不仅加强了基层力量，也克服了县级机关人浮于事的现象。例如该县工业很少，县委工业部长期没有什么工作做，这次工业部长下乡将工业部和财贸部合并；其他农村工作部、粮食局等部门都有两个到三个部长和局长，抽调一到两个部长和局长下乡，原有工作都根本不会受到影响。
    已经抽调的这批干部分别于1月7日先后走上新的工作岗位，他们表示要在农村安家立业，目前首先帮助所在地的农业社作好整社和为明年生产准备等工作。
