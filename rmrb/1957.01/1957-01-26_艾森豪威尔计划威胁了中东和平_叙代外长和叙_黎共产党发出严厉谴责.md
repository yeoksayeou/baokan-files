Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: According to TASS, Damascus, January 24th: Syrian Acting Foreign Minister Khalil Kallas issued a statement regarding Dulles' recent interpretation of "Eisenhowerism," stating: "The Eisenhower Plan is a threat to peace in the Middle East, and its publication has, in fact, exacerbated tensions in the region."

Kallas said that the Eisenhower Plan disregards the basic principles of international relations, especially the principles of complete equality between nations and national self-determination, as well as the United Nations Charter. He emphasized that it is not difficult to understand that this American imperialist plan poses the greatest danger to the people of the Middle East.

Kallas harshly criticized the so-called "vacuum" theory, saying that this notorious theory "is a pretext that imperialism has always attempted to use to mislead public opinion and clear the way for its new aggression."

Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: According to TASS, Damascus, January 23rd: According to the "Al-Nour" newspaper, the Central Committee meeting of the Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party unanimously adopted a statement, pointing out that "Eisenhowerism" seriously threatens peace and security in the Middle East.

The statement said: "The masses of people in Syria, Lebanon, and all Arab countries angrily and strongly condemn this imperialist Eisenhowerism, which aims to armed intervention in the internal affairs of Arab countries, infringe upon their independence and sovereignty, and undermine the UN Charter and principles."

The statement exposed the lie put forward by the United States that "there is a communist threat to Eastern countries", and pointed out that "Eisenhowerism" turns a blind eye to the real threat posed to Syria and Jordan by the 20,000 British and French troops stationed in Israel.

The statement also sharply criticized the economic aspects of "Eisenhowerism". It emphasized: "The purpose of this doctrine is to restrict Arab countries, requiring them to only establish economic and trade relations with countries in the capitalist camp, and not allowing Arab countries to establish economic and trade relations in accordance with their own interests."

Referring to the issue of providing economic "aid" to Arab countries mentioned in Eisenhower's Middle East policy message, the statement pointed out: "This kind of aid is attached with certain conditions, and no country that hopes to maintain its independence and sovereignty can accept this kind of aid."

The statement particularly emphasized that one of the main purposes of "Eisenhowerism" is to "support and consolidate the Baghdad Pact, which is on the verge of disintegration after the failure of the war of aggression against Egypt", and to "encourage Israeli extremists to implement an expansionist policy against the Arabs." The statement also pointed out that the United States is doing its utmost to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict at the expense of Arab rights, in order to conform with the interests of imperialism and Israel.

The statement concluded by pointing out that the Arab people will fight to the end against imperialist "Eisenhowerism" and will turn "these plans into waste paper."

The Central Committee meeting of the Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party was held in mid-January to discuss the political situation faced by Arab countries due to the threat of "Eisenhowerism." The Central Committee of the Communist Party called on all patriotic forces to strengthen unity and redouble their efforts to smash all imperialist conspiracies.

    艾森豪威尔计划威胁了中东和平
    叙代外长和叙—黎共产党发出严厉谴责
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社大马士革24日讯：叙利亚代理外交部长哈利尔·卡拉斯就不久前杜勒斯对“艾森豪威尔主义”的解释发表声明说：“艾森豪威尔计划是对中东和平的威胁，它的发表，事实上已经加剧了这一地区的紧张局势。”
    卡拉斯说，艾森豪威尔计划轻视国际关系的基本原则，特别是轻视国家间完全平等和民族自决的原则，以及轻视联合国宪章。他强调说，不难理解，美国这一帝国主义计划对中东人民是最大的危险。
    卡拉斯严厉抨击了所谓“真空”的理论，他说，这种声名狼借的理论“是一种借口，帝国主义一直企图用它把公众舆论引入迷途，为自己的新的侵略扫清道路”。
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社大马士革23日讯：据“光明报”报道，叙利亚—黎巴嫩共产党中央委员会会议一致通过一项声明，指出“艾森豪威尔主义”严重地威胁了中东地区的和平和安全。
    声明说：“叙利亚、黎巴嫩和所有阿拉伯国家的人民群众，愤怒而严厉地谴责这种旨在武装干涉阿拉伯国家内政、侵犯它们独立和主权、破坏联合国宪章和原则的帝国主义性质的艾森豪威尔主义。”
    声明揭露了美国提出的所谓“东方国家存在共产主义威胁”的谎言，并且指出，“艾森豪威尔主义”对驻在以色列的两万英法军队对叙利亚和约旦造成的现实威胁却熟视无睹。
    声明还尖锐地抨击了“艾森豪威尔主义”的经济方面。它强调指出：“这个主义的目的是限制阿拉伯国家，要它们只能同资本主义阵营的国家建立经济贸易关系，而不允许阿拉伯国家按照自己的利益来建立经济贸易关系。”
    这篇声明在谈到艾森豪威尔中东政策咨文中所提到的对阿拉伯国家提供经济“援助”的问题时指出：“这种援助是附有某些条件的，任何一个希望保持自己独立和主权的国家，都不能接受这种援助。”
    声明特别强调说，“艾森豪威尔主义”的主要目的之一是“支持和巩固在侵埃战争失败后行将瓦解的巴格达条约”，并且“怂恿以色列极端分子对阿拉伯人实行扩张政策”。声明还指出，美国竭力指望牺牲阿拉伯人的权利来解决阿拉伯和以色列的冲突，以符合帝国主义和以色列的利益。
    声明最后指出，阿拉伯人民将和帝国主义性质的“艾森豪威尔主义”斗争到底，并且要使“这些计划变成废纸”。
    叙利亚—黎巴嫩共产党中央委员会会议是在1月中旬举行的，会上讨论了阿拉伯国家由于受到“艾森豪威尔主义”的威胁所面临的政治形势。共产党中央委员会号召一切爱国力量加强团结，加倍努力，以粉碎一切帝国主义阴谋。
