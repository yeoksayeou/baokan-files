    Scientific Report Conference of the Institute of Psychology

    The Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences held its founding conference on December 22nd of last year. Following the founding conference, a scientific report conference was held. A total of twenty papers were presented at the scientific report conference, reflecting a portion of the research work conducted by the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences over the past few years.

    Comrade Cao Richang presented a paper on "The Problem of Stimulus Processes." The author described the current status and achievements of physiological-psychological research on analyzers, proposed several specific directions for further research, and suggested using in vitro culture of analyzer sensory tissues and tracer atoms to study the sensory processes in analyzers. Liu Fan and three other comrades presented a report on "The Influence of Alternating Far-Near Difference Differentiation Method on the Formation of Differentiation Inhibition." They used dogs as experimental subjects and employed the alternating far-near difference differentiation method to accelerate the formation of differentiation, achieving certain results. Li Jiazhi and three other comrades presented a report on "Sequential Reactions in Motor Dynamic Stereotypes." Based on their experimental findings, the authors supported E.N. Sokolov's argument that "motor dynamic stereotypes are skilled physiological mechanisms" and that "the disappearance of sequential reactions may be a condition in the process of 'skill' formation." They also proposed the hypothesis that the formation of new foci of excitation in the second signal system causes negative induction, explaining the prolonged latency of reactions during the disruption of motor dynamic stereotypes. Wu Jianglin and seven other comrades presented a report on "Experimental Research on the Mutual Dynamic Transmission of the First and Second Signal Systems in Children." Using experimental facts, they supported A.P. Luria's argument that the word system plays an intermediary role in the mutual dynamic transmission between the two signal systems. Xu Shulian and three other comrades presented a report on "Some Experiences in Studying the Connecting Function and Typological Characteristics of Eight-to-Ten-Year-Old Children Using the Method of Verbal Reinforcement of Motor Conditioned Reflexes." They interestingly analyzed ten children who failed to form the required motor conditioned reflexes in the experiment, discovering that their inability to form motor conditioned reflexes was due to their usual strict adherence to discipline, and therefore, they did not act arbitrarily without instructions from the experimenter. Thus, the authors concluded that "even in studying the connection problem of the simplest voluntary movement conditioned reflexes, the influence of past experiences and the role of the highest regulator of words must be considered."

    The above reports, as well as those made by other comrades, have certain reference value both theoretically and practically.

    The report conference also allocated appropriate time for discussion. There were many debates with differing opinions during the discussion, with the following issues being more concentrated.

    First, regarding the methods for determining nerve types. Many comrades believed that observation and historical methods are viable methods for determining human nerve types, because using experimental methods similar to those used on animals to determine human nerve types is not only too simplistic for humans, but also can lead to situations like the inability of some children to form conditioned reflexes as described in the report by Xu Shulian et al. However, some comrades disagreed with the above view, arguing that using observation and historical methods to determine nerve types cannot exclude the influence of the experimenter's (including the investigator's) subjective attitude on the experimental results. At the same time, the typological indicators used in observation and historical methods to determine nerve types are also questionable, because characteristics such as "degree of working ability" and "courage" and "bravery" are often not determined by a single simple nerve characteristic, but rather by the combined effect of many characteristics of nerve activity. In the discussion, everyone agreed that further research and the establishment of appropriate indicators for determining human nerve types are both theoretically and practically necessary. The statements in the discussion on nerve types also reflected that many comrades held inconsistent basic views on nerve types. Some comrades tended to believe that nerve type is closely related to the living environment and inseparable from it, and that it changes with the individual's life history. Therefore, they believed that observation and historical methods should be used to determine human nerve types. However, some comrades expressed another tendency, believing that nerve type is a basic physiological characteristic of nerve activity, that nerve type is different from personality characteristics, and that personality characteristics are determined to a greater extent by the individual's life history conditions.

    Second, regarding the dynamic transmission of the two signal systems. In the discussion, some comrades held different views on Ivanov-Smolensky's "method of studying motor conditioned reflexes with verbal reinforcement." They believed that this method itself has the suspicion of separating the two signal systems. However, some comrades disagreed with this view, arguing that although the two signal systems work together, this does not preclude the possibility of studying and examining them separately in experimental research. In the discussion, some comrades also had different views on Luria's argument that the word system plays an intermediary role in the mutual dynamic transmission between the two signal systems. They believed that the intermediary role of words is itself the result of the coordinated action of the two signal systems, therefore, it is incomprehensible to believe that the word system plays an intermediary role in the mutual dynamic transmission between the two signal systems.

    Third, regarding the research methods of psychology. In the discussion, someone proposed that psychology should have its own experimental methods and should not adopt the same experimental methods as higher nervous activity physiology. This view was not approved by everyone. For example, some comrades said that Pavlov's higher nervous activity physiology is closely related to psychology, and that some commonalities in experimental methods between the two are precisely due to the essential connection between these two sciences. Therefore, there is no benefit in rigidly dividing them in experimental methods, and the similarity in experimental methods between various sciences is also common. Of course, this does not preclude psychology from using some of its own unique experimental methods. The discussion of this issue actually touched upon the relationship between Pavlov's higher nervous activity physiology and psychology. (Feng Genquan)

    心理研究所的科学报告会
    中国科学院心理研究所在去年12月22日举行成立大会。在成立大会之后，举行了科学报告会。科学报告会上提出的论文报告共二十篇，论文报告反映了中国科学院心理研究室几年来研究工作的一部分情况。
    曹日昌同志在会上提出了“刺激过程问题”一文，作者叙述了分析器生理心理研究的现状和成就，提出了今后进一步研究的几个具体方向，并建议用分析器感受组织的离体培养以及用示踪原子等方法来研究分析器中的感受过程。刘范等四位同志提出了“远近差交替分化法对于分化抑制形成的影响”的报告，他们以狗作实验，运用了远近差交替分化的方法来加速分化的形成，并获得了一定的结果。李家治等三位同志提出了“运动动力定型中的顺序反应”的报告，作者根据他们的实验事实支持E．N．薄一科的论点，认为“运动动力定型是熟练的生理机制”，而“顺序反应的消失可能是‘技能’形成过程中的一种条件”。并提出了第二信号系统新兴奋灶的形成引起负诱导作用的假设，来解释运动动力定型破坏过程中反应的潜伏期延长的事实。吴江霖同志和其他七位同志提出的“儿童第一和第二信号系统的相互动力传递的实验研究”的报告，用实验的事实支持了A．P．鲁利亚所提出的词的系统在两个信号系统相互的动力传递中起着中介作用的论点。许淑莲等三位同志提出的“用言语强化的运动条件反射方法研究八——十岁儿童接通机能，类型特性的一点经验”的报告，有趣地分析了在实验中不能形成所要求的运动条件反射的十个儿童，发现他们所以不能形成运动条件反射是由于他们平时十分遵守纪律，因此在实验时不得到实验者的指示是不随便动作的。由此，作者在结论中指出：“即使是研究最简单的随意运动的条件反射的接通问题，也必须考虑到过去经验的影响以及词的最高调节器的作用”。
    以上这些报告以及其他一些同志所作的报告，在理论上和实践上都具有一定的参考价值。
    报告会还留出了适当的时间进行讨论。讨论中有着许多不同意见的争论，比较集中的有下列几个问题。
    第一、关于神经类型测定的方法问题。许多同志认为，观察法和历史法是测定人类神经类型的可取的方法，因为用类似于对付动物的那样一些实验方法来测定人类的神经类型，不仅对人类来说过于简单，而且会产生像许淑莲等同志的报告中所述及的有些儿童不能形成条件反射等情况。可是也有一些同志不同意上述意见，他们认为用观察法和历史法测定神经类型不能排除实验者（包括调查者）在观察时的主观态度对实验结果的影响。同时，用观察法和历史法测定神经类型所使用的类型指标也是值得怀疑的，因为像“工作能力程度”和“勇敢”、“胆量”等等特征，往往并不是由一个简单的神经特征所决定，而是神经活动的许多特征共同作用的结果。在讨论中大家认为，进一步研究和设定确当的人类神经类型测定的指标，在理论上和实践上都是十分需要的。从讨论神经类型问题的发言中，也反映出许多同志对于神经类型的基本看法并不一致。一部分同志倾向于认为神经类型是同生活环境密切联系不可分割，而且是随着个体生活历史的变化而有所变化的。因此，他们认为人类神经类型测定应当采用观察法和历史法。但是也有一些同志表现出另一种倾向，他们认为神经类型是一种神经活动的基本的生理特征，神经类型同个性特征是有所不同的，个性特征在更大的程度上由个体的生活历史条件所决定。
    第二、关于两个信号系统动力传递问题。在讨论中有些同志对伊万诺夫——斯莫林斯基的“以言语强化研究运动条件反射的方法”，持有不同的看法。他们认为，这个方法本身有将两个信号系统割裂开来的嫌疑。但是，也有同志不同意这个看法，他们认为两个信号系统尽管是协同作用的，但并不排斥在实验研究上分别开来研究和考察的可能性。在讨论中，有些同志对鲁利亚的词的系统在两个信号系统相互的动力传递中的中介作用的论点，也有不同的看法。他们认为，词的中介作用本身就是两个信号系统协同作用的结果，因此，认为词的系统在两个信号系统相互的动力传递中起着中介作用，这是不能理解的。
    第三、关于心理学的研究方法问题。在讨论中曾有人提出，心理学应当有自己的实验方法，不应当采用高级神经活动生理学同样的实验方法。这种看法并没有得到大家的赞同。例如，有的同志说，巴甫洛夫高级神经活动生理学同心理学是有着密切关系的，两者在实验方法上的某些共通性，正是由于这两门科学的本质上的联系所决定的，因而在实验方法上硬性划分没有什么好处，而况各种科学之间在实验方法上的相同也是常见的事。当然，这样也并不排斥心理学采用其特有的一些实验方法。讨论这个问题，实际上已经涉及了有关巴甫洛夫高级神经活动生理学同心理学的关系问题了。　（封根泉）
