    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 28th: Japan Socialist Party Secretary-General Inajiro Asanuma and others visited Foreign Minister Nobusuke Kishi today, demanding that the Japanese government express its opposition to the U.S. government regarding the stationing of atomic forces in Japan and Okinawa.

    They requested that the government prevent the U.S. military from transporting atomic weapons into Japan and areas near Japan, such as Okinawa and South Korea, and urged the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union to guarantee, through declarations, agreements, and other formal diplomatic documents, that they would not conduct atomic warfare in Japan and the surrounding areas.

    The representatives of the Socialist Party also demanded that the government remove military bases in Japan and Okinawa and make efforts to abolish the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and the Administrative Agreement. The Japan Socialist Party also requested that the government promote the cancellation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.

    Subsequently, Asanuma and others visited Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirohide Ishida and made the same suggestions. Hirohide Ishida replied, "Regarding the issue of the U.S. stationing atomic forces, it is a matter jointly handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Defense Agency, and the government is making efforts in accordance with the opinions of the suggestions made."

    日本社会党要求政府
    反对美国在日驻扎原子部队
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎等人今天访问了外务相岸信介，要求日本政府向美国政府表示反对在日本和冲绳驻扎原子部队。
    他们要求政府不要让美军把原子武器运进日本和冲绳、南朝鲜等接近日本的地区，并且促使美苏两国政府用宣言、协定等正式外交文件保证不在日本和日本周围地区进行原子战争。
    社会党的代表们还要求政府撤除在日本和冲绳的军事基地，并且进行努力，废除日美安全条约和行政协定。日本社会党也要求政府促使取消中苏友好同盟互助条约。
    随后，浅沼等人又访问了内阁官房长官石田博英，提出了同样的建议。石田博英回答说：“关于美国驻扎原子部队的问题，是外务省和防卫厅共同负责的事情，政府正在按照所提建议的意见进行努力。”
