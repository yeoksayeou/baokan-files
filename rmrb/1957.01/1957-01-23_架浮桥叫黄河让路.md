	Building a Pontoon Bridge and Telling the Yellow River to Make Way

	Tongguan Fenglingdu is an important transportation hub between Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces. The Datong-Puzhou Railway and the Longhai Railway are separated by the Yellow River here, preventing them from connecting. Passengers and goods rely entirely on wooden boats for ferrying.

	The Tongling Ferry Transportation Office has a total of thirty-seven wooden boats, which under normal circumstances can transport 1,000 tons of goods per day. When the wind is unfavorable or the waterway is poor, it can only transport 200-300 tons per day. Recently, the waterway has been poor, and there is also a lot of river ice. Sometimes, transportation is impossible for several consecutive days, resulting in a large backlog of goods on both sides of the river, and passengers have to find lodging in hotels. In order to maintain ferry traffic, the comrades at the Transportation Office came up with a solution: using twenty-eight wooden boats lined up in a row on the Yellow River between Tongguan and Fenglingdu to form a pontoon bridge. After a trial run, more than 500 tons of goods were transported in half a day. It is estimated that after the entire road surface is compacted, 2,000 tons of goods can be transported per day.

	Now, this first pontoon bridge on the Yellow River has been welcoming passengers and goods from both sides of the river. Large slogans are posted at both ends of the bridge, reading: "The Yellow River Makes Way." (Zhou Chengzhang)

    架浮桥叫黄河让路
    潼关风陵渡是秦晋交通要冲。同蒲铁路和陇海铁路在这里被黄河隔断，不能接轨，往来旅客和物资全赖木船摆渡。
    潼陵渡口运输处共有三十七只木船，正常情况下每天可以运送货物一千吨；遇到风不顺，航路不好，每天只能运送二、三百吨。最近水路不好，河凌又多，有时甚至接连几天不能渡运，两岸物资大量积压，过往旅客也不得不找客店住宿。运输处的同志为了维持渡口交通，想了一个办法，用二十八只木船在潼关和风陵渡的黄河面上一字摆开，组成一座浮桥。经过试运，半天就运了五百多吨货物，估计全部路面压好后，每天可运货两千吨。
    现在，黄河上的这第一座浮桥已经迎送两岸的旅客和货物，桥的两端贴着大幅标语，上写：“黄河让路”。　　　　　（周成章）
