    A Grain-Saving Canteen in an Organization

    Many factory, school, and organization canteens in Beijing are making efforts to save grain. The canteen of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League is one of them.
    The cooks in the canteen of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League have always paid attention to the issue of saving grain, and there has been no phenomenon of grain accumulation or waste. Recently, they have come up with some new methods for saving grain.　　　　　　　　　Reported by our correspondent Liu Changzhong, photography.
    Five or six qian of flour can be swept from a flour bag, which can save more than fifty jin of flour in a year.
    Fixed iron spoons are used to measure rice and water for each bowl of steamed rice, so the cooked rice will not overflow the bowl, and there are no hard, dry rice grains left on the empty bowl after eating.
    Making coarse grains finely can also save grain. Silk cakes and vegetable dumplings are popular among comrades.
    Equal emphasis is placed on saving grain and improving dishes. The cook Ni You and other experienced cooks are doing everything possible to satisfy people's tastes.

    北京市许多工厂、学校、机关的食堂，正在努力节约粮食。青年团中央机关食堂就是其中的一个。
    青年团中央机关的食堂的炊事员们对于节约粮食问题一贯是比较重视的，没有积压和浪费粮食的现象。最近，他们还想出了一些新的节约粮食的办法。　　　　　　　　　本报记者　刘长忠摄影
    从一个面粉袋里能扫出五、六钱的面粉，一年内就能节约五十多斤面粉。
    每碗蒸饭用固定好的铁匙量米和量水，熟后的饭不会涨出碗外，吃完饭的空碗上，也没有干硬的饭粒。
    粗粮细作也能节约粮食。丝糕、菜团子都受同志们的欢迎。
    节约粮食和改进菜食并重。炊事员倪友和其他富有烧菜经验的炊事员们，想尽办法满足人们的口味。
