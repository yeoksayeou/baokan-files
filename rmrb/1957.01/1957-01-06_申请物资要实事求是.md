    Applying for Materials Must Be Based on Facts

    The national material balance work for the first quarter of 1957 is currently underway. Due to the current material shortage, the state cannot fully meet the needs of the applying departments according to the requested amounts. Therefore, some departments consciously over-report.

    For example, the production task of the Longyan Iron Mine in the first quarter of 1957 did not increase, but the supply department increased the required amount by 91.35% compared to the actual amount when formulating the application plan; the mine only had two blast furnaces that needed major repairs, but they reported three.

    The finance department of the iron mine investigated the month-end inventory of the 303 types of state-controlled materials that the mine regularly consumes in October, and found that 291 items were over-planned reserves, with the minimum being 100 days and the maximum exceeding 400 days. When they suggested adjusting the surplus materials to brother factories and mines to meet urgent needs, they were rejected by the head of the supply department.

    We hope that the supply department of the Longyan Iron Mine should promptly take measures to revise the material application plan for the first quarter of 1957 and revise it in the spirit of seeking truth from facts. 　　Hou Zhihua

    申请物资要实事求是
    目前全国正在进行1957年第一季度的物资平衡工作。由于当前物资比较紧张，国家不可能完全按照需用部门的申请数满足需要。因此，有的部就有意识的多报一些。
    例如，龙烟铁矿1957年第一季度的生产任务并没有增加，但供应科在制定申请计划时，却把需要数比实际数增加了91.35％；该矿只有两座高炉需要大修，却报成三座。
    铁矿财务部门在10月份曾调查了该矿经常消耗的三百零三项国家控制物资的月终储存，发现有二百九十一项物资都是超计划储备，其中最少的有一百天，最高的达四百天以上。当他们建议将多余物资调剂给兄弟厂矿以应急需时，却遭到了供应科长的拒绝。
    我们希望龙烟铁矿供应部门应迅速采取措施，修订1957年第一季度的物资申请计划，本着实事求是的精神重新修订。　　侯志华
