　　U.S., Israeli, and Philippine Representatives Sing in Unison

　　Clamoring for UN Forces to Occupy Gaza and the Gulf of Aqaba

　　U.S. Representative Lodge stated that the United States also demands that Israeli troops withdraw from all Egyptian territory without delay.

　　However, this U.S. representative said that the United Nations Emergency Force should "immediately proceed to ensure the ceasefire and armistice agreement" when Israeli troops withdraw. He did not mention the need to obtain Egypt's consent in this matter.

　　Lodge advocated that the United Nations Emergency Force should continue to be stationed in the Gulf of Aqaba region until the local shipping issues are resolved before withdrawing.

　　Israeli Representative Abba Eban, disregarding the accusations of representatives from Asian and African countries, reiterated Israel's claim that Israel would not withdraw from the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba unless the United Nations Emergency Force simultaneously entered both regions.

　　Eban also said that Israel would only withdraw from Egyptian territory after receiving "effective guarantees of non-interference with the freedom of navigation for Israeli and international ships."

　　Philippine Representative Serrano said that he believed the United Nations Emergency Force could occupy Gaza without Egypt's consent. He said that in order to occupy this region, it might be necessary to redefine the mission of the United Nations Emergency Force.

　　Saudi Arabian Representative Dejani said that the same principles that led the United Nations to condemn aggression should now be used to prevent Israel from gaining any benefit from its aggression.

　　Dejani emphasized that the United Nations Emergency Force was stationed in Egypt solely to monitor the withdrawal of invading forces within that country, and it would be a mistake to consider it to have any other mission. He demanded that Israel's actions be condemned and that economic sanctions be imposed on Israel.

　　The General Assembly will continue to discuss the Middle East issue on the morning of the 29th.

### 美以菲三国代表异口同声  叫嚣由联合国军占领加沙和亚喀巴湾

    美以菲三国代表异口同声
    叫嚣由联合国军占领加沙和亚喀巴湾
    美国代表洛奇表示美国也要求以色列军队毫不拖延地撤出一切埃及领土。
    但是这个美国代表说，联合国紧急部队应该在以色列军队撤走的时候“马上前往保证停火和停战协定”。他没有提到这件事上需要获得埃及的同意。
    洛奇主张，联合国紧急部队应该继续驻扎在亚喀巴湾地区，直到当地的航运问题获得解决以后才撤出。
    以色列代表阿巴·伊班不顾亚非国家代表的指责，重申以色列的主张说，如果联合国紧急部队不在同时开进加沙狭长地带和亚喀巴湾地区，以色列就不从这两个地区撤退。
    伊班还说，以色列要得到“不干涉以色列和国际船只的通航自由的有效保证”以后才撤出埃及领土。
    菲律宾代表塞兰诺说，他认为联合国紧急部队可以不得到埃及的同意就占领加沙。他说，为了占领这个地区，可能需要重新规定联合国紧急部队的任务。
    沙特阿拉伯代表德贾尼说，现在应当利用使联合国谴责侵略的同样原则来防止以色列从它的侵略中得到任何利益。
    德贾尼强调指出，联合国紧急部队驻在埃及仅仅是为了监视在那个国家内的侵略部队撤出，如果认为它还有任何其它任务，那是一个错误。他要求谴责以色列的行动，对以色列实行经济制裁。
    大会将在29日上午继续讨论中东问题。
