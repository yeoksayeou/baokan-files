    He Xinquan, He Binhong, and Hao Lanting, and Others
    Donate Traditional Cantonese Opera and Jin Opera Scripts
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Guangzhou Qishengtang Pharmaceutical Factory Deputy Director Mr. He Xinquan and Cantonese opera playwright Mr. He Binhong, currently residing in Hong Kong, recently wrote to the Guangzhou City Opera Reform Committee, expressing their willingness to donate the Cantonese opera traditional scripts they possess without compensation.
    Mr. He Xinquan donated the heirlooms of his father-in-law, the late famous Cantonese opera artist Liang Rong (Zhang Huaquan). This includes a thick volume of handwritten scripts, as well as several scripts of Liang Rong's signature plays "Farewell My Concubine" and "Selling Vegetables."
    Mr. He Binhong donated 309 types of Cantonese opera traditional scripts, 93 outlines, a large number of past performance brochures, and several volumes of wooden fish books, which are stored at Mr. He Zhisheng's place in Guangzhou. Among them are "Purple Rosette Cup," "The Romance of the Zither and Sword," "Breaking the Lingzhi Mushroom," "Golden Chrysanthemum," and "The Battle of Chu and Han."
    The Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Culture has commended them. He Zhisheng, who preserved these materials, was also rewarded. (Li Yi)
    Another dispatch: The Datong City Xinmin Jin Opera Troupe went to Baotou City last December for a short tour. During the performance, 16 veteran artists including Hao Lanting donated 204 scripts (including oral scripts) and 51 types of musical scores to the Baotou City Bureau of Culture, including 32 historical traditional plays such as "Hanging the Belt at the Palace Gate" that have not been performed for a long time. This action greatly inspired the Baotou City troupes in exploring traditional repertoire. (Chang Xin)

    何信泉、何宾鸿和鄗兰亭等
    献出粤剧晋剧传统剧本
    本报讯　广州岐生堂制药厂副厂长何信泉和现居香港的粤剧编剧家何宾鸿两先生，最近先后写信给广州市戏曲改革委员会，表示愿意无代价地把所藏的粤剧传统剧本捐献出来。
    何信泉先生献出的是他的岳丈、已故的粤剧名艺人靓荣（张华泉）的遗物。共有手抄本一厚册，以及靓荣生前的首本戏“霸王别虞姬”和“卖菜成”等剧本数册。
    何宾鸿先生献出的是寄存在广州市何智生先生处的粤剧传统剧本三百零九种、提纲九十三件、大批过去的演出说明书以及木鱼书若干册。其中有“紫霞杯”、“琴剑缘”、“拗碎灵芝”、“金叶菊”和“楚汉争”等。
    广州市文化局已对他们予以表扬。保存这批资料的何智生也受到奖励。　（李峄）
    又讯　大同市新民晋剧团去年12月到包头市作短期旅行演出。在演出期间，鄗兰亭等十六位老艺人向包头市文化局献出剧本二百零四个（包括口述剧本）、乐曲五十一种，其中有久未上演的“宫门挂带”等历史传统剧三十二个。这一行动对包头市各剧团挖掘传统剧目有很大的启发。　（常鑫）
