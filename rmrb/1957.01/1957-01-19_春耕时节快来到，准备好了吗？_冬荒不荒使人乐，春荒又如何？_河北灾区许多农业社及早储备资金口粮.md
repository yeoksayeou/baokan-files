Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 18th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Hua reports: Many agricultural cooperatives in disaster areas of Hebei Province are accumulating production funds and food, preparing for spring plowing and to survive the spring famine. In Gaoyang and Anxin counties of Baoding Prefecture, which suffered relatively severe disasters, more than 80% of cooperative members have saved expenses and increased savings in various ways according to their spring famine survival plans. According to statistics from 220 cooperatives, they have saved 300,000 jin of grain and more than 400,000 yuan in cash in the past one or two months. Twenty-nine cooperatives, including Tongjin and Jianhua in Raoyang County, Shijiazhuang Prefecture, purchased and stored 320,000 yuan worth of agricultural tools, seeds, and feed.

After the disaster, agricultural cooperatives in the disaster areas of Hebei organized about 58% of the male and female labor force to carry out more than 100 kinds of large and small sideline productions, with a total income of more than 130 million yuan. Sideline income, coupled with state relief, helped the vast number of cooperative members resist the severe threat of famine, eliminate the phenomenon of fleeing famine and starvation, and create an unprecedented situation of no winter famine in history. However, some new problems have emerged. Many cooperative members believe that relying on the cooperative means they don't have to fear anything, and they have relaxed their vigilance against the spring famine. Many cooperative members began to be extravagant and wasteful after receiving sideline dividends. In Xingguozhuang, Gaoyang County, a severely affected area, some cooperative members did not bring dry food when they went fishing, and bought fried dough sticks and buns to eat when they were hungry. A female cooperative member in Yongcheng Village bought a set of floral fabric clothes but didn't like them, so she bought another set of floral woolen fabric, spending all the 23 yuan dividend in less than five days. The sales of cigarettes, alcohol, and general merchandise in Gaoyang County even greatly exceeded the figures of previous years before the disaster. In many severely affected areas such as Anping and Raoyang, the abnormal phenomenon of high-end cigarettes and alcohol being out of stock has occurred.

In order to reverse this deviation, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the disaster-stricken people to store enough grain for one or two months. Local party and government leading organs have strengthened education on thrift and famine survival in agricultural cooperatives according to local conditions, and vigorously organized disaster-stricken people to save. Ninety-five cooperatives in Gaoyang County have helped 34,182 cooperative member households make plans for thrift and famine survival. Anxin County commended more than 40 cooperative members who were good at saving and surviving the famine, established the good practice of saving is glorious and waste is shameful throughout the county, and the phenomenon of extravagance and waste has begun to decrease.

According to the experience of various places in Hebei, to prepare for spring plowing and survive the spring famine as soon as possible, cooperative members must understand the cooperative's income and expenditure and make practical arrangements for their lives. Cadres and cooperative members of the Minqiang Agricultural Cooperative in Gaoyang County worked together to clearly calculate the sideline businesses and income before the wheat harvest, the funds and labor required for spring plowing, and the living expenses of the cooperative members. After the cooperative members had a clear understanding, they automatically bought radishes, yams, and other substitutes for food, and reduced the purchase of clothing and New Year's goods. Eighty-three cooperative member households saved and stored 450 yuan. In the past, many agricultural cooperatives in Anxin County distributed all sideline income to cooperative members, which once fueled the extravagance and waste of cooperative members. Later, this practice was corrected. On the premise of not affecting the lives of cooperative members, appropriate deductions were made. In addition to repaying more than 130,000 yuan in loans, 106 cooperatives in the county have accumulated 280,000 yuan in preparation for spring plowing and surviving the spring famine.

### 春耕时节快来到，准备好了吗？  冬荒不荒使人乐，春荒又如何？  河北灾区许多农业社及早储备资金口粮

    春耕时节快来到，准备好了吗？
    冬荒不荒使人乐，春荒又如何？
    河北灾区许多农业社及早储备资金口粮
    新华社保定18日电　新华社记者张华报道：河北省灾区许多农业社正在积储生产资金和口粮，准备春耕生产和度春荒用。保定专区受灾较重的高阳、安新两县，已有80％以上的社员根据度春荒计划从多方面节省开支，增加储蓄。据二百二十个社的统计，在最近一两个月内就节约粮食三十万斤，现金四十多万元。石家庄专区饶阳县同进、建华等二十九个社，购买和储备了三十二万元的农具、种籽和饲料。
    受灾以后，河北灾区农业社曾经组织约占58％的男女劳力展开一百多种大大小小的副业生产，总共收入一亿三千多万元。副业收入加上国家的赈济，就帮助广大社员抗御严重的灾荒威胁，消灭了逃荒和冻饿死人的现象，出现了历史上空前的冬荒不荒局面。但是，目前又出现一些新的问题。许多社员认为依靠合作社就不怕一切了，放松了对春荒的警惕。许多社员得到副业分红后开始有些铺张浪费。重灾区高阳县邢果副业分红后开始有些铺张浪费。重灾区高阳县邢果庄有些社员下地捕鱼不带干粮，饿了就买油条包子吃。雍城村一个女社员刚买了一身花布衣服嫌不好看，又买了一身花大呢料子的，把一次分红的二十三元不到五天就花完了。高阳县城关烟酒百货的销售额，竟大大超过灾前各年的数字。安平、饶阳等许多重灾区，都曾经出现高级烟酒脱销的不正常现象。
    为了扭转这种偏向，中共河北省委号召灾民储备下一两个月的粮食。各地党政领导机关根据当地条件，加强了农业社节约度荒的教育，大力组织灾民储蓄。高阳县九十五个社已经帮助三万四千一百八十二户社员订出节约度荒计划。安新县表扬了节约度荒较好的四十多名社员，在全县树立起节约光荣、浪费可耻的风尚，铺张浪费现象开始减少。
    根据河北各地经验，要及早做好春耕生产和度春荒的准备工作，必须使社员了解社里的收入和开支情况，切实安排自己的生活。高阳县民强农业社干部和社员一起算清楚麦收前的副业门路和收入，春耕所需的资金和劳力，社员的生活费用以后，社员们心里有底，便自动地买萝卜、山药等代食品，减少衣服、年货的购置，八十三户社员就节约储存下四百五十元。安新县许多农业社过去把副业收入全部分配给社员，曾经助长社员的铺张浪费，后来改正了这种作法，在不影响社员生活的条件下作适当的扣留，全县有一百零六个社除归还十三万多元的贷款外，已经积存下二十八万元，准备春耕生产和度春荒用。
