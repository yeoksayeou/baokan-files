Prior to this, the Zhejiang Provincial Organization Committee had sent a working group to Yiwu County for a month-long investigation.

According to responsible staff members of the Zhejiang Provincial Organization Committee, the purpose of this investigation is to prepare for the work of streamlining institutions and staff throughout Zhejiang Province, so that the subsequent streamlining work can be more realistic and achieve the goal of overcoming bureaucracy and improving work efficiency. The working groups will thoroughly understand the size and complexity of the tasks of the above-mentioned two county and city organs this year, the scope of responsibilities, the working relationship between various departments, and the current staffing of each organ. Finally, they will propose preliminary plans for the Provincial Organization Committee to refer to. The resettlement of surplus personnel will also be a key focus of the research.

In addition to county and city organs, the working groups dispatched this time will also investigate one or two townships, focusing on understanding the changes in the tasks of the township after agricultural cooperation, as well as the division of labor and staffing of cadres.

    使精简编制切合实际
    浙江进行调查研究工作
    新华社杭州12日电　浙江省编制委员会在7日派出工作组分别到吴兴县和嘉兴市去调查这些县市的行政、事业、企业机关的机构编制情况。对省级机关的机构编制的调查研究工作已在8日开始。
    参加这次调查工作的，有中共浙江省委员会和浙江省人民委员会有关部门的工作人员。在这以前，浙江省编制委员会曾经派出工作组在义乌县作了为时一个月的调查。
    据浙江省编制委员会的负责工作人员说，这次调查的目的是为浙江全省精简机构编制工作做好准备，使以后的精简工作更能切合实际，做到克服官僚主义、提高工作效率的目的。工作组将要详细了解以上两个县市机关今年工作任务的大小、繁简，职责范围和各部门之间的工作关系，以及各机关目前的人员配备情况，最后提出初步方案，提供省编制委员会参考。对编余人员的安置也要着重研究。
    除了县、市机关以外，这次派出的工作组还要调查一两个乡，着重了解在农业合作化以后，乡的任务的变化以及干部的分工和配备情况。
