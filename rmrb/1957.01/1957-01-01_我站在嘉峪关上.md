    I stand on Jiayu Pass,
    The spring breeze caresses my clothes,
    Great Wall, please make way!
    The spring breeze wants to blow to the Gobi Desert.
    The spring breeze turns the camel thorns on the Gobi green,
    The spring breeze scatters the wild sheep on the Gobi,
    The spring breeze awakens the saplings beside the highway,
    The spring breeze wants to visit the treasures in the Gobi.
    The Qilian Mountains, wearing snow helmets,
    Embrace a palace of black gold,
    Oil will flow like a river,
    Wheels will roll on the rails like waves...
    Joyful Qilian, proud Qilian,
    Since it stood here, it has never seen such a spring.
    On the old site of the beacon tower,
    The red flag spreads its wings like an eagle,
    It overlooks this vast Gobi Desert,
    Sandstorms cannot stop it from flying forward.
    I stand on Jiayu Pass,
    Welcoming the singing from Jiuquan,
    The rails are laid following the red flag,
    Bringing the spring of socialism.

    我站在嘉峪关上
    易莎我站在嘉峪关上，春风拂弄着我的衣裳，长城呵，请你让开道吧！春风要吹到戈壁滩上。春风吹绿了戈壁上的骆驼刺，春风吹散了戈壁上的黄羊，春风唤醒了公路旁的树苗，春风呵，要拜访戈壁里的宝藏。戴着雪盔的祁连山，拥抱着黑金的宫殿，石油将像河水一样流动，车轮在铁轨上如同波浪滚翻……欢笑的祁连，骄傲的祁连，自从它站立在这儿，还没见过这样的春天。在那烽火台的旧址上，红旗像鹰张开了翅膀，它俯视着这广漠的戈壁，风沙挡不住它向前飞翔。我站在嘉峪关上，迎接着从酒泉传来的歌唱，铁轨顺着红旗铺来了，带来了社会主义的春光。
