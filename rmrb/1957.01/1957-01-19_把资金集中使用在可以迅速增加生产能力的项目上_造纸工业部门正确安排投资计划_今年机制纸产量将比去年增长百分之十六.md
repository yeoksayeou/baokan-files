Xinhua News Agency, January 16th: This year, 90% of all investment in China's machine-made paper industry will be used to increase production capacity. It is estimated that this year's machine-made paper production will increase by 16.12% compared to last year.

According to the original plan, a large part of this year's paper industry investment was to be used for projects to be completed next year and some engineering projects in preparation for the Second Five-Year Plan. In line with the principles of increasing production and practicing economy, and in the spirit of prioritizing the satisfaction of the country's paper needs, the Paper Industry Administration recently made appropriate revisions and reductions to non-production equipment and less urgent engineering projects. The investment reductions in non-urgent engineering projects such as the Jiamusi Paper Mill technical school and the Kaishantun Paper Mill filter pool alone amounted to more than 2.5 million yuan. The factory building project of Baoding Paper Mill, which was originally planned to be expanded this year, as well as some auxiliary equipment for transportation etc. that various paper mills planned to add this year in preparation for the Second Five-Year Plan, have also been decided to be postponed or delayed.

After these adjustments and revisions, 90% of the investment is concentrated on six newly built and expanded large-scale paper mills, including Jiamusi, Anhui, and Zhongyuan, which will be put into production this year. In addition, the investment in the renovation of old factories and the balancing of equipment, which requires less investment and can increase production in the short term, has also been increased from the originally planned 3 million yuan to more than 10 million yuan. It is estimated that after the newly built and expanded projects are put into production ahead of schedule, they can increase the production of machine-made paper by more than 60,000 tons.

    把资金集中使用在可以迅速增加生产能力的项目上
    造纸工业部门正确安排投资计划
    今年机制纸产量将比去年增长百分之十六
    新华社16日讯　今年我国机制纸工业的全部投资将有90％用在增加生产能力方面，预计今年机制纸的产量将比去年增长16.12％。
    根据原定计划，今年造纸工业投资有很大一部分是用在明年完工的工程和为第二个五年计划作准备的一些工程项目上。造纸工业管理局本着增产节约的原则和尽先满足国家用纸需要的精神，最近对非生产设备和不十分急需的工程项目作了适当的修改和削减，仅削减的佳木斯造纸厂技工学校和开山屯造纸厂滤水池等非急需的工程项目投资，就有二百五十多万元。原来计划在今年扩建的保定造纸厂的厂房工程，以及各造纸厂为第二个五年计划作准备的一些要在今年增添的运输等附属设备，也决定缓办或延期建设。
    经过这样调整和修改以后，就使90％的投资集中用在今年投入生产的佳木斯、安徽、中原等六个新建和扩建的大型造纸厂。此外对投资少，在短期能增加产量的旧厂改造和平衡设备方面，也由原来计划投资三百万元增加到一千多万元。预计新建和扩建的工程提前投入生产以后，可以增产六万多吨机制纸。
