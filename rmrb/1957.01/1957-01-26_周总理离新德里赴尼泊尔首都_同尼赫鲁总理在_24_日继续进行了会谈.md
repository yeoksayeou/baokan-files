Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 25th: Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their entourage departed from New Delhi by plane at 10:00 AM today for Kathmandu. Indian Prime Minister Nehru saw them off at the airport.

Before boarding the plane, Premier Zhou Enlai made a brief statement to reporters, saying, "On the occasion of the eve of India's Republic Day, I would like to extend my warm congratulations to the Indian people and the Indian government through you, congratulating the Indian people on achieving even greater accomplishments in the cause of building their own country and safeguarding world peace in the future."

Premier Zhou Enlai said that India is playing an increasingly important role in safeguarding world peace. The Chinese and Indian people are working together to strive for the freedom and independence of all countries and to safeguard world peace.

A reporter asked: Regarding the recent statement by the U.S. President that the U.S. government will not change its policy towards China until China releases ten Americans, what is his opinion? Premier Zhou Enlai replied: These are two separate matters. Criminals should be dealt with in accordance with Chinese law. How can the policies of two countries be determined by ten criminals? Should we also base our policies on the thousands of Chinese students or tens of thousands of overseas Chinese in the United States? That is incorrect.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that we are willing to be friendly with the American people. This is our policy; we want peace.

A reporter from "The Times of India" asked him if it was true, as reported in newspapers, that foreign spies were using Kalimpong as a base for espionage activities in Tibet.

Premier Zhou Enlai replied that there was such information.

Prime Minister Nehru took photos with Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long in front of the plane, arm in arm. The Indian government presented Premier Zhou with a seven-volume newsreel, two thousand meters long, about Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long reviewed the guard of honor at the airport and shook hands with the people who came to see them off. Chinese Ambassador to Nepal, Pan Zili, also traveled to Kathmandu on the same plane.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 25th: Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru held talks at the Indian Presidential Palace from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM on the 24th.

After dinner, the two Prime Ministers continued their talks.

    周总理离新德里赴尼泊尔首都
    同尼赫鲁总理在24日继续进行了会谈
    新华社新德里25日电　周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和随行人员在今天上午十时乘飞机离开新德里前往加德满都。印度总理尼赫鲁到机场送行。
    周恩来总理在登上飞机之前，对记者们发表简短谈话说：“趁此印度共和国国庆前夕，我通过你们谨向印度人民和印度政府致热烈的祝贺，庆贺印度人民今后在为建设自己的祖国和维护世界和平的事业中取得更大成就。”
    周恩来总理说，印度在维护世界和平的事业中起着越来越大的作用。中国人民和印度人民一道，为争取各国的自由、独立和维护世界和平而共同努力。
    有记者问：关于美国总统最近所说在中国释放十名美国人之前，美国政府将不改变对中国的政策，他的意见如何？周恩来总理回答说：这是两件事。犯人犯法应该照中国的法律办。两个国家的政策怎能决定于十个犯人？难道我们也把政策决定于在美国的几千个中国学生或几万侨民？这是不对的。
    周恩来总理说，我们愿意和美国人民友好，这是我们的政策，我们要和平。
    “印度时报”的记者问他，据报纸报道，外国间谍利用噶伦堡作基地向西藏进行特务活动，这确实吗？
    周恩来总理回答说，有这个材料。
    尼赫鲁总理同周恩来总理和贺龙副总理在飞机前面手挽着手照相留念。印度政府把一部共七卷、长两千公尺的关于周恩来总理访问印度的新闻纪录片赠给周总理。
    周恩来总理和贺龙副总理在机场检阅了仪仗队，并且和送行的人一一握手告别。中国驻尼泊尔大使潘自力也同机前往加德满都。
    新华社新德里25日电　周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理24日下午四时到七时在印度总统府进行了会谈。
    晚餐后，中印两国总理继续会谈。
