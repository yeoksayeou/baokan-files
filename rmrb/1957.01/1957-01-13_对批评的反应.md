Reactions to Criticism

    The reader's letter "Leftover Buns Thrown on the Roof," published in the People's Daily on December 19, criticizing the waste of food in our school, is basically in line with the facts. The waste was even more serious when the mess hall was organized in August and September of last year. The main reason for the waste is that the school's political and ideological work was not tightly grasped at ordinary times, and the education of cherishing food was neglected among the students. At present, we must carry out education on saving food among teachers, staff, and students. We also plan to mobilize everyone to calculate the actual amount of food needed, improve mess hall management, and block loopholes in food waste.

    对批评的反应
    人民日报12月19日发表的读者来信“房顶上扔着剩馒头”，批评我校存在着浪费粮食的情况，所谈基本上是符合事实的。在去年8、9月组织伙食团的时候，浪费的现象更严重。浪费的主要原因，是学校平时的政治思想工作抓得不紧，忽视在学员中进行爱护粮食的教育。目前我们要通过在教职员和学员中进行节约粮食教育，还计划发动大家核算粮食的实际需用量，改进食堂管理，堵塞浪费粮食的漏洞。
