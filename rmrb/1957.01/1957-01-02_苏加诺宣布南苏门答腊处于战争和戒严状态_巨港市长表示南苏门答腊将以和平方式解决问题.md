Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 1st: The Ministry of Information announced yesterday that, due to the current situation in South Sumatra, President Sukarno has declared that the area belonging to the Second Military District and its surrounding waters are under war and martial law, effective December 29th.

Yesterday morning, representatives of the South Sumatra Provincial Government Committee and representatives of the "South Sumatra Social Aspirations Transmission Committee" who came to Jakarta from South Sumatra met with Indonesian Minister of Internal Affairs Sunarjo. They demanded broader autonomy.

Palembang Mayor Ali Amin, in his capacity as head of the Transmission Committee delegation, told Antara News Agency reporters that the main purpose of the delegation's visit was to request that South Sumatra province be granted autonomous status so that it could use its local resources for local construction.

He believes that all problems can be resolved within the scope of the law. If the central government cannot meet their demands, South Sumatra will act in accordance with the law. South Sumatra's tradition is to resolve problems peacefully, and they do not advocate for events like those in Central Sumatra and North Sumatra to occur.

    苏加诺宣布南苏门答腊处于战争和戒严状态
    巨港市长表示南苏门答腊将以和平方式解决问题
    新华社雅加达1日电　情报部昨天宣布，由于南苏门答腊目前局势的发展，苏加诺总统已经宣布从12月29日起第二军区所属的地区和它的海面处于战争和戒严状态。
    昨天上午，从南苏门答腊来到雅加达的南苏门答腊省政府委员会代表和“南苏门答腊社会愿望传达委员会”的代表先后会见了印度尼西亚内政部长苏纳约。他们要求更广泛的自治。
    巨港市长阿里·阿明以传达委员会代表团团长身份告诉安塔拉通讯社记者说，这个代表团的到来主要是要求给予南苏门答腊省以自治的地位，使它能以本区的资源来进行本区的建设。
    他认为，一切问题都可以在法律范围以内加以解决。如果中央政府不能满足他们的要求，南苏门答腊将循法律行事。南苏门答腊的传统是以和平方式解决问题，他们不主张发生中苏门答腊和北苏门答腊那样的事。
