    One Fine Seed Strain Spread Across Seven Hundred Mu
      “One fine late rice seed strain spread across seven hundred mu,” This is a widely circulated exciting event in the Shunong Township Gongjin Agricultural Cooperative of Changtai County, Fujian.
    This cooperative has an outstanding seed selection technician – Dai Chuncheng. In the autumn of 1951, he went to the fields to find good seeds and searched six times in a row. Finally, he found an "unnamed" seed with dense grains, large panicles, uniform panicle tips, and plump grains. In 1952, he propagated one hundred plants from this seed and harvested sixteen catties of grain seeds. By 1953, he had replanted these sixteen catties of grain seeds. The rice from these "unnamed" seeds grew particularly well. Before they matured, eight townships contacted him to sign contracts to select and exchange good seeds. That year, all 1,980 catties of seeds he harvested were exchanged. In 1956, the "unnamed" seeds he selected had been推广 (tuī guǎng - promoted, popularized, extended) across seven hundred mu in the Gongjin Agricultural Cooperative, and yielded good harvests, producing thirty-five catties more per mu than other seeds. As a result, the cooperative increased production by 24,500 catties of grain. To commend Dai Chuncheng for the benefits that single-spike seed selection brought to the collective, the members of the cooperative named the "unnamed" good seeds he cultivated "Chuncheng Good Seeds." ·Longxi Farmer's Newspaper·

    一穗良种传了七百亩
      “一穗晚稻良种传了七百亩”，这是福建长泰县树农乡共进农业社盛传的一件盛事。
    这个社有一个出色的选种技术员——戴春成。他在1951年秋到田里找良种，一连找了六次，最后，找到了一穗粒密穗大、穗尾齐、粒粒饱满的“无名”种。1952年他把这穗种子繁殖了一百株，收了十六斤谷种；到1953年，他又把这十六斤谷种再种下去。这些“无名”种的稻子长得特别好，未成熟前，乡里就有八个社找他订立选换良种的合同。这一年，他收的一千九百八十斤种子都被换走了。1956年，他选的“无名”种，已经在共进农业社推广了七百亩，并获得很好的收成，每亩比种别的种子多收了三十五斤。因此，使社里增产了二万四千五百斤谷子。社员们为表扬戴春成单穗选种给集体带来的好处，就把他培育的“无名”良种称为“春成良种”。　·龙溪农民报·
