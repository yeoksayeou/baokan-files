    Explanation of the Review Process for the 1956 Chinese Academy of Sciences Science Award (Natural Sciences Section)
    I. In order to encourage the initiative and creativity of scientific workers and promote the development of China's scientific undertakings to serve socialist construction, the Provisional Regulations on the Chinese Academy of Sciences Science Award were adopted and promulgated at the 17th plenary meeting of the State Council on August 5, 1955, establishing a reward system for scientific research work. In accordance with the provisions of the regulations, the Chinese Academy of Sciences had decided to commence the evaluation of scientific research works in 1956 and planned to announce the results on May 4. Later, since most of the academicians participated in the formulation of the national science and technology development plan from January to June 1956, they were unable to complete the selection work as scheduled. Therefore, the Executive Council of the Chinese Academy of Sciences decided to postpone the date for announcing the award results; authorized the Standing Committee of the academic divisions to absorb Beijing-based academicians to participate, in order to expand the form of the Standing Committee, to execute the selection tasks stipulated in Article 7 of the Regulations; and in order to ensure the quality of the selection work, the award of scientific research works in natural sciences and social sciences was held separately, and in 1956, only scientific research works in the natural sciences section were awarded.
    II. From October 1, 1955, to March 1, 1956, a total of 419 pieces of natural science research works were received from various sources. Among them, 104 belonged to mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc.; 201 belonged to biology, earth sciences, etc.; and 114 belonged to technical sciences. In the selection process, the relevant academic divisions adopted the following steps: (1) According to the nature of the recommended scientific research works, experts in various disciplines were invited to conduct preliminary reviews; (2) Relevant experts were invited to meetings for discussions and re-reviews, and a trial selection was conducted at the expanded meeting of the Standing Committee of the academic divisions; (3) Formal evaluations were made of the academic achievements and significance to the national economy of the works to be awarded; and a secret ballot was held to determine the winning works and their grades. The preliminary results of the academic divisions' selection were submitted to the Chinese Academy of Sciences Science Award Committee for unified review and voting. Finally, it was approved by the Executive Council of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and announced.
    III. The following issues are worth emphasizing in the selection process:
    (1) Regarding the application of reward standards. According to Article 2 of the Regulations, the object of the award is scientific research work and writings that "have made significant achievements in academics or have significant significance for the development of the national economy and culture." However, in the specific implementation of this provision, consideration was also given to the existing level of scientific development in the world and the historical conditions of China's past scientific development, the different characteristics of various disciplines, and specific benchmarks were proposed for the scientific research works submitted for evaluation, and repeated comparisons and balancing were carried out. The final result was the 34 award-winning works listed in the announcement. Among these works, most are works that are creative in academics and have a certain significance to the national economy, and a few are exploratory works in theoretical aspects, or works that are not significantly creative in academics but have greater practical value. This result basically conforms to the provisions of the Regulations, the actual development of science in China, and the needs of national construction.
    (2) Regarding the recommendation of scientific research works. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, there are still many scientific research works completed by scientific workers at home and abroad that "have made significant achievements in academics or have significant significance for the development of the national economy and culture" that have not been evaluated because they were not recommended. Among them, scientific research works published by scientific workers abroad, especially those received, are few in number because the widespread organization of recommendation work started late. It is hoped that all parties will widely recommend them before the next evaluation.
    In addition, among the works submitted for evaluation this time, some were not reviewed or were reserved because the authors themselves requested a postponement of the award; some were decided to be reserved for the next consideration because some issues still need to be investigated further; and some were suggested to the recommending units to have the authors continue their work and recommend them for award next time because the research work has not yet been completed or needs to be further verified. There are also some works that are suitable for awarding in the production sector, and suggestions will be made to the relevant departments separately.
    IV. This award process may have many shortcomings due to lack of experience. However, thanks to the care of the Party and the government, the assistance of the scientific community and all relevant parties, and the serious and conscientious work of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Science Award Committee, the academicians of various academic divisions, and hundreds of relevant experts, satisfactory results have been achieved. It can be expected that this will have a beneficial impact on the development of scientific work in the future, will help to further stimulate the initiative and creativity of scientific workers, and will help to increase the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people for scientific undertakings, thereby promoting the faster realization of China's scientific development plan.

    中国科学院1956年度科学奖金（自然科学部分）评审经过说明
    一、为了鼓励科学工作者的积极性和创造性，促进我国科学事业的发展，以服务于社会主义建设，1955年8月5日国务院全体会议第十七次会议通过并发布了中国科学院科学奖金暂行条例，建立了科学研究工作的奖励制度。中国科学院根据条例的规定，早经决定于1956年开始进行科学研究论著的评奖工作，并准备于5月4日公布评奖结果。后来由于大部分学部委员自1956年1月至6月期间内，参加了国家的科学远景规划的制订，未能如期完成评选工作。因此，中国科学院院务常务会议决定：将公布评奖结果的日期推迟；授权学部常务委员会吸收在京委员参加，以扩大常务委员会的形式，执行条例第七条所规定的评选任务；为了保证评选工作的质量，并将自然科学和社会科学两部分的科学研究论著的评奖分开举行，1956年度只就自然科学部分的科学研究论著进行评奖。
    二、从1955年10月1日起，至1956年3月1日止，先后收到各方面推荐的自然科学研究论著共四百一十九件。其中属于数学、物理学、化学等方面的一百零四件；属于生物学、地学等方面的二百零一件；属于技术科学方面的一百一十四件。有关各学部在进行评选工作中，采取了下述步骤：（1）根据推荐的科学研究论著的性质，聘请各学科的专家分别进行初审；（2）邀请有关专家集会讨论，进行复审，并在学部常务委员会扩大会议进行试选；（3）对准备给奖论著在学术上的成就、对国民经济的意义作出正式的评价；举行无记名投票，决定得奖论著及其等次。学部评选的初步结果提交中国科学院科学奖金委员会，进行统一审核和投票表决。最后经中国科学院院务常务会议批准，予以公布。
    三、在评选工作中有以下一些问题值得着重加以说明：
    （1）关于奖励标准的掌握。按照条例第二条规定，评选工作是以“在学术上有重大成就或对国民经济、文化发展具有重大意义”的科学研究工作和论著作为奖励对象。但在具体执行这一规定时，还照顾到世界现有科学发展水平和我国过去科学发展的历史条件、各学科不同的特点，对应征的科学研究论著提出具体衡量标准，反复地进行了比较和平衡。最后评定的结果便是公布所列的三十四件得奖论著。在这些论著中，大多数是在学术上有创造性而又具有一定的国民经济意义的工作，少数几件是理论方面的探索性工作，或是学术上创造性不够显著而实用价值较大的工作。这种结果，基本上是符合于条例的规定、我国科学的实际发展状况和国家建设的需要的。
    （2）关于科学研究论著的推荐工作。自中华人民共和国成立以来，科学工作者们无论在国内国外所完成的，“在学术上有重大成就或对国民经济、文化发展上具有重大意义”的科学研究论著，因未被推荐而未加以评选的尚有不少，其中，科学工作者在国外发表的科学研究论著，因广泛组织推荐工作开始较晚，收到的尤其不多，希望各方面在下次再评选前广泛推荐。
    此外，在这次接受推荐请奖的论著中，有的由于作者本人提出要求推迟请奖，未予评审或者予以保留；有的因为有些问题还需要继续调查，决定保留至下一次再行考虑；有的由于研究工作尚未结束或尚需进行补充验证，将建议推荐单位请作者继续工作，下次再推荐请奖。还有一些是适于在生产部门给奖的工作，也将分别向有关部门提出建议。
    四、这次评奖工作，因经验不足，缺点可能是很多的。但由于党和政府的关怀，由于科学界和有关各方面的协助，由于中国科学院科学奖金委员会、各学部委员以及有关的数百位专家严肃认真地进行了一系列的工作，已经取得可以满意的结果。可以预计到，这对于今后科学工作的发展必将产生有益的影响，必将有助于进一步发挥科学工作者的积极性和创造性，有助于提高广大人民对科学事业的热情支持，从而促进我国的科学远景规划更快的实现。
