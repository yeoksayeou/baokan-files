Xinhua News Agency, January 26th: Indian Ambassador to China, R.K. Nehru, held a reception in Beijing tonight to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the founding of the Republic of India.

Chen Yun, Acting Premier of the State Council, attended the reception and, in his speech, extended his warm congratulations on behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China to the great neighboring government and people of the Republic of India.

Chen Yun said that we are very pleased to see that the friendship between China and India, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, has further developed in the past year. Not long ago, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long paid a friendly visit to India at the invitation of the Indian government and Prime Minister Nehru. The grand welcome given to them by the Indian government and people vividly embodies the profound friendship between the one billion people of China and India.

He said that we have also further strengthened the exchange of construction experience between our two countries. The Chinese people are pleased to see that the Indian people have achieved many accomplishments in the cause of building their own country. We believe that you will achieve even greater successes during your second five-year plan, which has just begun. There is no doubt that as the economic construction of the two countries develops, we will learn more and more from each other.

Chen Yun said that in the past year, the Republic of India has made important contributions to opposing colonialism, maintaining peace, and easing international tensions. The cooperation between our two countries in international affairs has also become closer. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by China and India have been recognized by more and more countries and are playing an increasingly significant role. We believe that this close cooperation between China and India will continue to develop in the new year.

Finally, Acting Premier Chen Yun proposed a toast to the prosperity of the Republic of India and the happiness of its people, to the great friendship between India and China, to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, to peace in Asia, Africa, and the world, and to the health of President Rajendra Prasad of the Republic of India.

The host of the reception, Ambassador R.K. Nehru, first spoke about India's construction situation. He said that in order to build their country, they urgently need peace, and they are also working with other countries to ease international tensions. He also said: We are against military means, because this will cause increased tension and maintain the division of the world. We believe that international disputes can and should be resolved peacefully, that countries with different political and social systems can and should coexist peacefully, and that coexistence, even cooperation, between these countries is an extremely important necessity.

He said: Our great neighbor China also has this belief. Together, our two countries, representing not only the oldest civilizations in the world but also one-third of the world's population, created the doctrine of Panchsheel. Together, we have provided an answer to the threat that humanity still faces today.

R.K. Nehru said that the friendship and cooperation between our two countries has promoted the strengthening of the forces of peace. In the past, our mutual contacts were limited to cultural aspects. Since last year, the nature of this contact has changed. Given that our two countries face similar problems, our mutual need to learn from each other's experiences has increased.

Referring to Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India, R.K. Nehru said that this visit symbolized the developing new relationship between our two countries. Premier Zhou Enlai went to India not only to pay a friendly visit but also to study the various aspects of India's domestic development. As he said in many speeches, what he saw was enough to convince him that there are many things we can learn from each other. The warm welcome given to him by the hundreds of millions of Indian people marks our desire to enhance the friendship and cooperation between the peoples of our two countries.

R.K. Nehru finally proposed a toast to the friendship and cooperation between the great peoples of China and India, to the friendship and cooperation between the peoples of Asia and Africa, the peoples of the world, to Panchsheel and world peace, and to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong.

Also present at tonight's reception were Vice Premiers Peng Dehuai and Nie Rongzhen, Vice Chairmen Huang Yanpei and Chen Shutong, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Fu Zuoyi, Secretary-General of the State Council Xi Zhongxun, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Chen Geng, as well as heads of various departments of state organs and people from all walks of life in Beijing.

Heads of diplomatic missions and diplomatic officials of various countries in China also attended the reception.

After the reception, the Indian film "Lighthearted Anklets" was shown.

    庆祝印度共和国成立七周年
    印度大使举行招待会
    新华社26日讯　印度驻中国大使拉·库·尼赫鲁今晚在北京举行招待会，庆祝印度共和国成立七周年。
    国务院代总理陈云出席了招待会，他在讲话中代表中华人民共和国政府和人民向伟大的邻邦印度共和国政府和人民表示热烈的祝贺。
    陈云说，我们十分高兴地看到，在过去一年中，中印两国之间基于和平共处五项原则的友谊又有了进一步的发展。不久以前周恩来总理和贺龙副总理应印度政府和尼赫鲁总理的邀请在印度进行了友好访问。印度政府和人民所给予他们的盛大欢迎生动地体现出中印两国十亿人民的深厚友谊。
    他说，我们两国在交流建设经验方面也有了进一步的加强。中国人民高兴地看到，印度人民在建设自己国家的事业中已经获得了许多成就。我们相信，你们在刚开始不久的第二个五年计划期间必将获得更大的成就。毫无疑问，随着两国经济建设的发展，我们相互学习的东西将会越来越多。
    陈云说，过去一年中，印度共和国在反对殖民主义、维护和平和缓和国际紧张局势方面作出了重要的贡献。我们两国在国际事务中的合作也已经更加紧密。中印两国共同倡导的和平共处五项原则已经为越来越多的国家所承认，并且正在发挥着日益巨大的影响。我们相信，中印两国这种紧密的合作在新的一年将继续获得发展。
    陈云代总理最后提议为印度共和国的繁荣和人民的幸福，为印度和中国之间的伟大友谊，为和平共处的五项原则，为亚洲、非洲和世界的和平，为印度共和国拉金德拉·普拉沙德总统的健康干杯。
    招待会的主人拉·库·尼赫鲁大使在讲话中首先谈到了印度的建设情况，他说，为了建设他们的国家，他们十分迫切地需要和平，他们也正在同其他国家协同努力来和缓国际紧张局势。他又说：我们反对军事上的手段，因为这将引起紧张局势的加剧和保持世界分裂。我们认为国际争端可以而且应当和平解决，不同政治和社会制度的国家可以而且应当和平共处，而且这些国家间的共处，以至于合作，乃是极端重要的必需品。
    他说：我们的伟大邻邦中国也具有这种信念。我们这两个国家在一起，不仅代表着世界上最古老的文明，而且占世界人口的三分之一，倡建了潘查希拉的学说。我们在一起对人类今天仍然面临着的威胁提出了答复。
    拉·库·尼赫鲁说，我们两国之间的友谊和合作促进了和平力量的加强。过去，我们的相互接触还只限于文化方面。自从去年以来，这种接触的性质已有改变。鉴于我们两国面对着类似的问题，我们双方相互学习对方经验的要求日益增长了。
    谈到周恩来总理访问印度时，拉·库·尼赫鲁说，这次访问象征了我们两国间发展着的新的关系。周恩来总理到印度去，不仅是为了进行友好访问，而且是为了研究印度国内发展各方面的情况。正如他在许多次演讲中所说的，他所看到的东西足以使他相信，我们之间有许多可以互相学习的地方。印度亿万人民对他的热烈欢迎，标志着我们要增进两国人民之间的友谊和合作的愿望。
    拉·库·尼赫鲁最后提议为中印两国伟大人民之间的友谊和合作，为亚非人民、世界人民之间的友谊和合作，为潘查希拉和世界和平，为毛泽东主席的健康干杯。
    出席今晚招待会的，还有副总理彭德怀、聂荣臻，副委员长黄炎培、陈叔通，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞，国防委员会副主席傅作义，国务院秘书长习仲勋，外交部副部长张闻天，中国人民解放军副总参谋长陈赓，以及国家机关各部门的负责人和北京社会各界人士。
    各国驻中国的使节和外交官员也出席了招待会。
    招待会以后，放映了印度影片“轻妙的脚铃”。
