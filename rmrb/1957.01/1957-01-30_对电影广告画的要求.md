    Requirements for Movie Advertisements

    After watching the Hungarian film "Ward No. 9," I couldn't help but feel a sense of revulsion when I looked back at the huge advertisement posted at the entrance of the cinema.

    Why is it that some movie advertisements insist on depicting a semi-naked woman or a nauseating scene of a couple kissing passionately? I think this is probably due to some movie advertisement designers' incorrect understanding of the audience's psychology. Regardless of whether the woman is the protagonist of the film, or whether the couple has qualities worth learning from and imitating by the audience, as long as there is such a scene in the movie, the designer will cling to it. What a vulgar and low-level design idea!

    "Ward No. 9" has an upright and resolute male image—Tóth. Why isn't he depicted in the advertisement? Movie advertisements should first reflect the noble theme and images of a film to evoke noble emotions in people's hearts. In this regard, I think the advertisement for the Mexican film "The Right to Be Born" is better and worth referencing by advertisement designers.

    对电影广告画的要求
    看了匈牙利影片“第九号病房”，回头再张望一下贴在电影院门口的那张巨大广告，不禁起了一种反感。
    为什么有一些电影广告上，定要画上一个半裸的女性，或是一双男女正在狂吻的肉麻镜头呢？我想，这恐怕是由于一些电影广告设计者对观众心理的不正确理解。不管这女性是否是这影片的主角，或这一对男女是否有值得观众学习和模仿的品质，只要电影中有那么一个镜头，设计者就紧紧抓住它。这是多么庸俗、低级的设计思想啊！
    “第九号病房”这部影片有一个正直而坚毅的男性形象——托特，为什么广告上不画他呢？电影广告应当首先反映出一部影片的高尚的主题和形象，以唤起人们心灵中崇高的感情。在这一点上，我认为墨西哥影片“生的权利”的广告画得比较好，值得广告设计者们参考。
