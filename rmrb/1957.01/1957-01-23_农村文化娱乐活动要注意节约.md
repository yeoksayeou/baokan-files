	Rural Cultural and Entertainment Activities Should Pay Attention to Thrift

	In some rural amateur theatrical troupes in Xindeng County, Zhejiang Province, there is a serious waste phenomenon after the autumn harvest. I know of three cases. After the autumn harvest distribution, the troupes buy ancient costumes, stage large operas, and perform commercial performances in other counties, which not only seriously wastes the funds of the agricultural cooperatives, but also causes the winter production to stagnate in some places, and no one cultivates the overwintering crops. The theatrical troupe of the Shimen Agricultural Cooperative in Shimen Township of the county recently bought more than 600 yuan worth of ancient costumes from Suzhou (because they could not buy them in Hangzhou and Shanghai); the theatrical troupe of the Wanshi Agricultural Cooperative in Wanshi Township also bought more than 400 yuan worth of ancient costumes; a theatrical troupe in Tongqiao Township also bought more than 200 yuan worth of ancient costumes for performing operas. Where did this money come from? It is said that it was "voluntarily" donated by the members of the cooperative. For example, the Shimen Agricultural Cooperative with about 300 households had to "voluntarily" donate an average of 2 yuan per household. The cooperative members reflected: It is good for the cooperative to have a bumper harvest and increase income, but there are two things that are not good, one of which is using 600 yuan of the cooperative's public accumulation fund to buy ancient costumes. In order to perform large-scale ancient costume operas such as "The Legend of Bao Gong," "Qin Xianglian," and "War Zone Marriage," some theatrical troupes also hired opera "teachers" at a salary of 1.3 yuan a day. The Shimen Cooperative theatrical troupe, with 31-40 people, went to perform in other places for eight consecutive days before December 13th due to "invitations" from other places, and only reluctantly returned when the township government called and said that their own cooperative was going to hold a bumper harvest meeting; but no one cultivated the overwintering crops in the cooperative, the rape was frozen and nearly 70%-80% died, and no one cared; nearly 10,000 workers were needed for winter water conservancy projects, but no work was done, but so much labor could be spared for performing operas. According to several responsible comrades in Shimen Township, these situations have been reported to relevant departments, but there has been no response. Therefore, rural theatrical troupes like Shimen are still planning to go to other places and other counties for longer and more frequent performances. They also said: It is good to perform in Tonglu and Lin'an counties, where there are more people watching and higher prices can be charged.
	I suggest that the leading departments in various places, especially the cultural departments and the leading departments of agricultural production, resolutely stop this phenomenon of waste and hindering production. Rural amateur theatrical troupes and other cultural and entertainment propaganda activities must implement the principles of being amateur, thrifty, and conducive to giving play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants for production. I hope that the cultural departments and other relevant departments, when organizing rural cultural activities, will not forget our country's existing agricultural production level and rural economic conditions.

    农村文化娱乐活动要注意节约
    在浙江省新登县的部分农村业余剧团中，秋收后存在着严重的浪费现象。据我知道的就有三起。剧团在秋收分配后买古装，排大戏，到外县作商业性的演出，不仅严重地浪费了农业社的资金，而且使少数地方的冬季生产停顿，越冬作物无人培养。该县石门乡石门农业社的剧团，就在最近从苏州（到杭州、上海买不到）买来了六百多元的古装行头；万市乡万市农业社剧团也买了四百多元的古装行头；桐乔乡有个剧团也买了二百多元演戏的古装。这些钱是哪里来的呢？据说是社员“自愿”捐助出来的，像石门这个三百来户的农业社每户平均要“自愿”捐助二元。社员群众反映：社里得到丰收增加收入是好的，但有两件事不好，其中之一就是把全社六百元公积金用来买古装行头。为了要演“包公传”“秦香莲”“战地姻缘”等这样的古装大戏，一些剧团还花一元三角一天的工资请来了演戏“教头”。有三十一四十人参加的石门社剧团在12月13日前，因外地的“邀请”一连去演出了八天，直至乡政府去电话说自己社里要开丰收大会才勉强回来；但是社里的越冬作物无人培育，油菜受冻，死了近70％—80％，没有人管；冬季修水利需要近一万个工，也没有动手，但是却能抽出这么多的劳动力去演戏。据石门乡里的几个负责同志说，这些情况曾向有关方面反映过，但是没有动静，因此，像石门等农村剧团还在计划着去外地、外县作更长时间和更多次的演出。他们还说：到桐庐和临安县去演好，那里看的人多，卖得起价。
    我建议各地领导部门，特别是文化部门和农业生产的领导部门，坚决制止这种浪费和妨碍生产的现象。农村业余剧团和其他文娱宣传活动，必须贯彻业余的、节约的、有助于发挥广大农民生产积极性的原则，希望文化部门和其他有关部门，在组织农村的文化活动时，不要忘掉我国现有的农业生产水平和农村的经济条件。
