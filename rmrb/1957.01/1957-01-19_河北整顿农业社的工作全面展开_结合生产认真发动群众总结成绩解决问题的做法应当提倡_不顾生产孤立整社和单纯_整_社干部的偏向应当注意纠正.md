Hebei Province Comprehensively Launches Work to Rectify Agricultural Cooperatives

Combining Production, Earnestly Mobilizing the Masses to Summarize Achievements and Solve Problems Should Be Encouraged

The Tendency of Ignoring Production to Isolate Rectification and Simply "Rectifying" Cooperative Cadres Should Be Corrected

(Reported by this newspaper) After gaining some experience through key trials, the work of rectifying agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Hebei Province has been universally launched.

Last year was the first year for the realization of advanced cooperativization in rural Hebei, and the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives demonstrated enormous superiority in production or disaster relief. However, due to the lack of experience in running advanced cooperatives among many cadres; the subjective and bureaucratic work styles of party and government leaders at all levels; and the coercive and commanding styles of some grassroots cadres, many agricultural cooperatives experienced numerous problems, affecting the production enthusiasm of their members. In response to this situation, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held its second expanded plenary meeting in November of last year. After careful analysis and research, it was decided to concentrate efforts over a period of two to three months before this year's spring planting to conduct a universal rectification of agricultural cooperatives; it was decided that rectification should start with production and be closely integrated with party rectification work, fully promoting democracy, and that various problems within the cooperatives should be reasonably resolved in accordance with policies through summarizing and reviewing the production work of the past year, affirming achievements, and identifying lessons learned.

Before starting the rectification of agricultural cooperatives, party and government leading organs at all levels convened a series of meetings to convey the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Provincial Party Committee. After investigation, nearly four hundred agricultural cooperatives of different types were selected for pilot rectification work. After gaining initial experience in rectification, various localities classified the agricultural cooperatives, determined the key points and steps for rectification, and began to carry out the rectification work in an all-round way. According to incomplete statistics from early January, more than 14,000 cadres have been successively dispatched, after centralized study or short-term training, led by responsible cadres, to engage in production rectification work.

In the work of rectifying agricultural cooperatives, many areas have paid attention to starting with arranging production and helping cooperatives solve the main problems hindering current production. In Tianjin Prefecture, more than 1,850 cooperatives have reasonably divided the scope of sideline production management during rectification. Generally, large-scale sideline businesses are managed uniformly by the cooperative, while small-scale and sporadic businesses are managed separately by the members; some cooperatives have also assigned a portion of sideline businesses to the production teams for management. More than 1,990 cooperatives have established a regular pre-distribution system for sideline income. Many agricultural cooperatives have also settled the fertilizer investments of members last year, greatly encouraging the production enthusiasm of members.

After the initial launch of winter production and the stabilization of members' thinking, many rectification cadres earnestly mobilized the masses to comprehensively summarize the achievements and experiences of running cooperatives over the past year, and also identified many problems. Combining work summaries and inspections, they first conducted party rectification and strengthened ideological education for party members. Many party members and cadres saw the achievements of the past year and strengthened their confidence in running agricultural cooperatives well. At the same time, through mass inspection, they also recognized the problems and were willing to humbly review their mistakes with the members. After rectification of the seven agricultural cooperatives in Tangguantun District, Jinghai County, the thirty party member cadres who originally had thoughts of changing shifts actively rose up after reviewing their mistakes. Through summarizing experiences and lessons, the broad masses of members also gained a correct understanding of the achievements and problems of running cooperatives over the past year, overcame the mood of simply complaining about the cooperative cadres, and actively participated in the rectification work. For example, in the Xinhua, Hongxing, and other five agricultural cooperatives in Jinghai County, more than 950 members boldly criticized the cooperative cadres, and also put forward more than 80 rationalization proposals for improving management, expressing their willingness to work with the cooperative cadres to run the cooperatives well. Democratic life within the cooperatives became active.

On the basis of mobilizing the masses, each cooperative is solving important specific problems in accordance with policies. Many areas are resolving the legacy issues that were not properly resolved when farmers' fruit trees, trees, reed fields, livestock, etc. were brought into the cooperatives last year. Those that were not appraised are being reasonably appraised; those whose original appraisals were unreasonable are being re-adjusted; some cooperatives have adopted the method of temporarily distributing dividends according to proportion for fruit trees, reed fields, etc., and then appraising them and returning them to the cooperatives after a few years. Some agricultural cooperatives in Lincheng County, based on the principle of mutual benefit, returned scattered fruit trees and young animals to the members. After reasonably resolving the issue of members' means of production entering the cooperatives, the agricultural cooperatives in Baodi, Yongqing, and other seven counties in Tianjin Prefecture had individual members who wanted to withdraw from the cooperatives no longer clamoring to withdraw. Thirty-one cooperatives in Xingtai County also returned more than 890 self-retained fruit trees to the members based on their opinions, which the members were very satisfied with.

In the process of rectification, many counties have adjusted some of the larger-scale agricultural cooperatives based on the opinions of the members, adhering to the principles of benefiting production, benefiting unity, and facilitating management. Efforts are made to consolidate those that can be consolidated, and those that are not easy to continue to operate are appropriately divided. Appropriate adjustments have also been made to the original irrational divisions of cultivated areas and production teams based on specific circumstances. After the division of many originally poorly-founded joint village cooperatives, it was easier for the cooperative cadres to approach the masses, and the members' production morale was also improved. After the division and rectification of the Dengzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Boye County, the eighty households who originally requested to withdraw from the cooperative no longer withdrew, and actively participated in winter production activities; fourteen individual farmers more clearly recognized the superiority of the advanced cooperative and also requested to join the agricultural cooperative.

After some rectification cadres arrived at the agricultural cooperatives, they did not start with production, but isolatedly carried out rectification work, so that after rectification, winter production was not launched in some cooperatives. Some cadres did not work deeply, did not fully mobilize the masses, and did not resolve legacy issues within the cooperatives in accordance with mutual benefit policies; although some problems were resolved, they were still unreasonable. Some simply "rectified" the cooperative cadres, hurting their enthusiasm for running the cooperatives. After discovering these problems, leading organs at all levels are inspecting and correcting them. (Shuofeng)

    河北整顿农业社的工作全面展开
    结合生产认真发动群众总结成绩解决问题的做法应当提倡
    不顾生产孤立整社和单纯“整”社干部的偏向应当注意纠正
    本报讯　河北省各地整顿农业生产合作社的工作，经过重点试验取得一定的经验以后，已经普遍展开。
    去年是河北农村实现高级合作化的第一年，绝大多数的农业社在生产或救灾中，都显示了巨大的优越性。但是，由于许多干部缺乏办高级社的经验；各级党政领导上有些主观主义、官僚主义的作风，某些基层干部有强迫命令作风，许多农业社都发生了不少问题，影响了社员的生产积极性。针对这种情况，去年11月，中共河北省委举行了第二次扩大的全体会议。经过认真的分析研究，确定在今年春播前，以两三个月的时间，集中力量，对农业社进行一次普遍的整顿；决定整社要从生产入手，并与整党工作密切结合，充分发扬民主，通过总结和检查一年来的生产工作，肯定成绩，找出教训；使社内的各种问题，都按照政策合理解决。
    各地党、政领导机关在开始整顿农业社以前，都召开了一系列的会议，传达了省委第二次全体会议的精神，经过调查，选择了近四百个不同类型的农业社，做了整社试点工作。取得了整社的初步经验以后，各地把农业社分了类，确定了整社的重点和步骤，开始全面进行整社工作。据1月上旬的不完全统计，各地已先后抽出一万四千多名干部，经过集中学习或短期训练，由负责干部带领，投入生产整社工作。
    在整顿农业社的工作中，许多地区都注意了先从安排生产，帮助社内解决障碍当前生产的主要问题。天津专区已经有一千八百五十多个社，在整社中合理地划分了副业生产的经营范围，一般大宗的副业由社统一经营，小宗的和零星的由社员分散经营；也有的社把一部分副业划归生产队经营。有一千九百九十多个社建立了副业收入定期预分制度，许多农业社对社员去年的肥料投资也作了清理，大大鼓舞了社员的生产积极性。
    在初步展开冬季生产、社员思想稳定以后，许多整社干部都认真发动群众，全面总结一年来办社成绩和经验，并检查出不少问题，结合工作总结检查，首先进行整党，加强了对党员的思想教育。许多党员、干部看到一年来的成绩，增强了办好农业社的信心。同时，经过群众检查，也使他们认清了问题，都愿虚心向社员检讨错误。静海县唐官屯区的七个农业社经过整顿，原先有换班思想的三十名党员干部，在检讨了错误以后，都积极起来了。通过总结经验教训，广大社员对一年来的办社成绩和问题也有了正确认识，克服了单纯埋怨社干部的情绪，积极参加了整社工作。如静海县新华、红星等五个农业社中，有九百五十多个社员都大胆地批评了社干部，同时还提出了八十多条改进经营管理的合理化建议，表示要与社干部一起把社办好。社内民主生活活跃了起来。
    各社在发动群众的基础上，都在根据政策解决重要的具体问题。许多地区都在解决去年农民果树、林木、苇田、牲口等入社时没有得到妥善解决的遗留问题。没有作价的，正在合理作价；原来作价不合理的，重新调整了价格；有的社对果树、苇田等采取了暂按比例分红，几年后再作价归社的办法。临城县有些农业社，根据互利原则，把零星果树、幼畜退给了社员。天津专区的宝坻、永清等七个县的农业社，在合理解决了社员生产资料入社的问题以后，个别想要退社的社员不闹退社了。邢台县有三十一个社还根据社员的意见，退给了社员八百九十多棵自留果树，社员对这样做很满意。
    许多县在整社过程中，对一些规模较大的农业社，根据社员的意见，本着有利生产、有利团结、便于经营的原则进行调整，能巩固的力求巩固，不易继续办下去的，适当地划分开。对原来耕作区和生产队划分不合理的，也根据具体情况，进行了适当的调整。许多原来基础不好的联村社在划开以后，社干部便于接近群众了，社员的生产情绪也提高了。博野县登庄农业社经过划分和整顿，原来要求退社的八十户社员，现在不退社了，积极地投入冬季生产活动；有十四户单干农民，更清楚地认识到高级社的优越性，也要求加入农业社。
    有些整社干部到农业社以后，不是从生产入手，而是孤立地进行整社工作，因而有的社经过整顿以后，冬季生产也没有开展起来。也有些干部工作不深入，不充分发动群众，没有按照互利政策解决社内遗留问题；有些问题虽然解决了，但仍不合理。有的单纯“整”社干部，伤害了他们的办社热情。在发现这些问题以后，各级领导机关正在检查纠正。　（朔风）
