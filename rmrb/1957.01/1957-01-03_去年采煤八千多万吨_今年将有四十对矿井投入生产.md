Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: In 1956, China's coal industry achieved remarkable results in both production and capital construction. In 1956, the raw coal produced by coal mines under the Ministry of Coal Industry reached more than 80.5 million tons, a figure 12% higher than the raw coal production of the coal mines under the Ministry of Coal Industry in 1955. The actual figure was more than 8 million tons of raw coal higher. The output of coking coal needed by the iron and steel industry reached 5.57 million tons in 1956. The total output value completed by the Ministry of Coal Industry in 1956 exceeded the original plan by 4.52%. Labor productivity has been greatly improved, with an average of 1.17 tons of coal produced per worker every eight hours, a figure 4.74% higher than the original plan. Last year, each coal mine production worker produced nearly 13 tons more raw coal for the country. If all the coal produced by the production workers is used for power generation, it can generate more than 5.98 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity.

In 1956, 24 pairs of coal mine shafts with a total designed capacity of 7.73 million tons under the Ministry of Coal Industry were put into production. These mine shafts include newly built, rebuilt, and restored mine shafts. In 1957, another 40 pairs of mine shafts with a total designed capacity of more than 10 million tons will be put into production.

In 1956, the workload of coal geological exploration was 58.5% higher than in 1955. In 1956, 1.1 million meters of geological drilling was completed, which was more than 50% higher than in 1955. In 1956, geological personnel conducted topographic and geological surveys of more than 80,000 square kilometers, and obtained a large amount of carefully investigated reserves of various types of coal.

The design capabilities of coal mine designers also improved significantly in 1956. Designers have completed preliminary designs for 51 pairs of mine shafts and technical designs for 9 pairs of mine shafts.

In 1956, the state built 1.6 million square meters of housing for coal mine workers across the country, and a new batch of housing will be built for workers in 1957. The wage level of coal mine workers increased by 15% in 1956. The welfare undertakings such as canteens and nurseries for coal workers also made great improvements in 1956.

    去年采煤八千多万吨
    今年将有四十对矿井投入生产
    新华社2日讯　1956年我国煤炭工业生产和基本建设都获得了显著的成绩。1956年煤炭工业部所属煤矿生产的原煤达到八千零五十多万吨，这个数字比1955年煤炭工业部系统的煤矿所生产的原煤产量高出12％，实际数字高出八百多万吨原煤。钢铁工业所需要的炼焦煤的产量，1956年达到了五百五十七万吨。1956年煤炭工业部完成的生产总值，比原定计划超过4.52％。劳动生产率大大提高，平均每个工人每八小时生产一点一七吨煤，这个数字比原定计划高出4.74％。去年煤矿生产工人平均每人为国家多生产近十三吨原煤。如果把全部生产工人多生产出来的煤用于发电，可以发五十九亿八千多万度电。
    1956年煤炭工业部有设计能力总共达七百七十三万吨的二十四对煤矿矿井投入了生产。这些矿井中有新建、改建和恢复的矿井。1957年还将有设计能力总共达一千万吨以上的四十对矿井投入生产。
    1956年煤炭地质勘探的工作量比1955年高出58.5％。1956年地质钻探完成了一百一十万公尺，这比1955年高出50％以上。地质人员在1956年进行了八万多平方公里的地形、地质测量，并且获得了大量的精查出的各种煤的储量。
    煤矿设计人员的设计能力，1956年也有显著的提高。设计人员已完成了五十一对矿井的初步设计、九对矿井的技术设计。
    1956年国家为全国煤矿职工建筑了一百六十万平方公尺的住宅，1957年还要再给职工新建一批住宅。煤矿职工的工资水平1956年提高了15％。为煤炭职工开办的食堂和托儿所等福利事业，1956年也有很大的改进。
