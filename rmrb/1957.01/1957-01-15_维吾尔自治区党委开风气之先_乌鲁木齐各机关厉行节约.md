The trend of practicing thrift and economy is beginning to take shape in Urumqi.

In order to vigorously practice thrift and economy, the Chinese Communist Party Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee, focusing on the General Office, inspected instances of waste. The inspection revealed that the General Office was overstaffed, and the waste in sending telegrams, making long-distance calls, and printing documents was also very serious. Currently, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Party Committee has 914 staff members. Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the Party Committee, said at a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Autonomous Region Party Committee: "The number of staff members of the Autonomous Region Party Committee will never need to reach this number." Now the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Party Committee and the People's Committee are formulating a plan for streamlining and economizing.

Since mid-December of last year, Wang Enmao, the First Secretary of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, has often walked two *li* to his office in the morning. Other responsible staff members either walk to work or share cars.

With the Autonomous Region Party Committee taking the lead in setting a new trend of thrift and economy, government departments and people's organizations have also begun to establish a style of thrift and economy. In the telegraph bureau, various organs have rarely sent lengthy telegrams, and unnecessary long-distance calls have been greatly reduced. Every Sunday, the heads of various organs no longer take public cars for private matters. In some organs and enterprises where food waste was more serious in the past, it is now difficult to see leftovers in the dining hall.

    维吾尔自治区党委开风气之先
    乌鲁木齐各机关厉行节约
    本报讯　节约的风气在乌鲁木齐市开始形成。
    为了厉行节约，中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会，以办公厅为重点，检查了浪费。检查中发现办公厅人浮于事，发电报、打长途电话和印文件等方面的浪费情形也很严重。目前，自治区党委的工作人员达九百一十四人。党委第一书记王恩茂同志在自治区党委常务委员会议上说：“自治区党委的工作人员，永远也不必要达到这个数目。”现在新疆维吾尔自治区党委和人民委员会正在制定精简节约的方案。
    自从去年12月中旬以来，新疆维吾尔自治区第一书记王恩茂同志常常在早晨步行二里前往办公室。其他的负责工作人员上班时，有的步行，有的合乘汽车。
    自治区党委既开节约风气之先，政府各部门和人民团体也开始树立节约的风气。在电报局，各机关已经很少送来冗长的电报，不必要的长途电话也大大减少了。每到星期日，各机关的负责人也不再因私事乘坐公家的小汽车外出。过去浪费粮食比较严重的某些机关、企业今天，在饭堂里，很难见到残羹剩饭了。
