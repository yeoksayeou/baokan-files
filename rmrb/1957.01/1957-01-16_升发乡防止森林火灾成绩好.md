    Shengfa Township Achieves Good Results in Preventing Forest Fires
    (Our Dispatch) Shengfa Township in Luquan County, Yunnan Province, has not had a forest fire for five years. Shengfa Township has 524 households, and the villages are very scattered. Nearby are 22,000 mu of forest, 5,000 mu of bamboo forest, and 20,000 mu of barren mountains, making it a mountainous area with conditions for comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. Before 1951, farmers competed for mountain areas and used slash-and-burn grazing, often causing forest fires. In 1952, the township established a forest protection and fire prevention organization, and all 18 villages in the township have forest protection groups. As a result of conscientious forest protection for five years, farmers' incomes have greatly increased. Now, sales of pine nuts, tea fruits, and medicinal materials alone can bring in more than 1,300 yuan a year. After the establishment of the forest protection organization, more than 20,000 items such as manure baskets and flower baskets are woven every year. Last year alone, the Second Cooperative of Shengfa Township had an income of more than 4,600 yuan from forestry. Because there have been no fires for five years, the small trees that were burned in the past have also grown up.
    The reason why Shengfa Township can prevent mountain fires is primarily because the Party branch made the masses aware of the benefits of accumulating fertilizer, fixing cultivated land, and prohibiting slash-and-burn cultivation, so that the masses consciously abide by the discipline of preventing mountain fires.

    升发乡防止森林火灾成绩好
    本报讯　云南禄劝县的升发乡，五年来没发生过森林火灾。升发乡有五百二十四户，村落非常分散，附近有树林两万二千亩、竹林五千亩、荒山两万亩，是一个具有农林牧全面发展条件的山区。1951年前，由于农民争抢山场、炼山放牧，常使山区遭到火灾。1952年，全乡建立了护林防火组织，全乡十八个村庄都有护林小组。五年来认真护林的结果，农民的收益有了很大的增加。现在，光是松子、茶果、药材等一年可卖一千三百多元。在护林组织成立后，每年编粪箕、花箩等用具就有两万多件。升发乡第二社只去年一年，林业收入就有四千六百多元。由于五年没火灾，过去烧毁的小树也长起来了。
    升发乡所以能杜绝山火，首先是因为党支部使群众认清了积肥、固定耕地、禁止砍火地的好处，使群众把杜绝山火当作自觉遵守的纪律。
