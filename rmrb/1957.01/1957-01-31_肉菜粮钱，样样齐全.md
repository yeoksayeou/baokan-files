Meat, Vegetables, Grain, and Money – Everything Provided

The Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Hedi Township, Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, has prepared 21 pigs (including those raised by members) and 80 sheep in order to allow its members to have a good Spring Festival, providing a total of 4,800 jin of meat. At the same time, they have prepared 32,000 jin of cabbage, 8,000 jin of tofu, 2,000 jin of vermicelli, and 500 jin of flour. In addition, 52,500 jin of wheat will be taken from the cooperative's grain reserves and distributed to members at a rate of four liang per work day; and 5,000 yuan will be drawn from sideline income and distributed to members at a rate of two fen per work day. In this way, each member of the cooperative can receive an average of more than one jin of meat, eight jin of cabbage, two jin of tofu, half a jin of vermicelli, and thirteen jin of wheat, as well as 1.2 yuan of pocket money. These figures are double those of 1946 before liberation and are also the highest since liberation. The cooperative’s twelve “Five Guarantees” households are even more fortunate, each receiving two and a half to three jin of meat, five jin of tofu, and five yuan of pocket money. These meat, vegetables, grain, and money were distributed to the members long ago. The members all happily said: "Socialism has a bright future. We don't have to worry about food and clothing. We have meat, vegetables, grain, and money. We are truly happy during the New Year and festivals. We will never forget the Communist Party's blessings, and we will work even harder in production in the future." (Wen Zhenwei)

    肉菜粮钱，样样齐全
    山西闻喜县河底乡先锋农业社，为了使社员们过好春节，准备好二十一头猪（包括社员的猪）和八十只羊，共可杀肉四千八百斤。同时，还准备好白菜三万二千斤，豆腐八千斤，粉条二千斤，粉面五百斤。此外，从社里存粮中拿出小麦五万二千五百斤，按每个劳动日四两分给社员；又从副业收入中抽出五千元，按每个劳动日二分分给社员。这样，全社每个社员平均可吃到一斤多肉，八斤白菜，二斤豆腐，半斤粉条，还可分到十三斤小麦和一元二角零花钱。这些数字，比解放前的1946年要高一倍，也是解放后最多的一年。全社的十二户“五保”户更是幸福，他们每人可吃到二斤半到三斤肉，五斤豆腐，还可用到五元零花钱。这些肉、菜、粮、钱，很早就分配到社员手里。社员们都高兴地说：社会主义有奔头，吃不熬煎穿不愁，肉菜粮钱样样有，过年过节真幸福，享福不忘共产党，今后生产更加油。			　（文振威）
