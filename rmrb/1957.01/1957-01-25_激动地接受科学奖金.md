    Excitedly Accepting the Science Prize
    Qian Xuesen
    The Chinese Academy of Sciences has decided to award me a prize for my research work in "Engineering Cybernetics." I am excitedly accepting this prize. The reason for my excitement is that I recall a period when I was doing research in "Engineering Cybernetics" in the United States. I deeply feel the greatness of the motherland and the support of the 600 million people of the motherland for scientific research.
    I was not originally engaged in cybernetics, nor had I studied the theory of automatic control and automatic adjustment. My previous specialty was the study of aerodynamics, elasticity, and jet and rocket propulsion engines. That was before 1950, before I decided to return to the motherland to participate in construction. In the summer of 1950, when I wanted to return to China, the U.S. government found various excuses and trumped-up charges to prevent me from leaving the United States by every possible means. Someone told me that the U.S. government's actions were because my specialty was related to the construction of the motherland, especially related to the defense industry, and the United States wanted to hinder the rapid advancement of China's science and technology by detaining me. Of course, if this was true, it would be in vain. The 600 million people of the People's Republic of China are an awakened people, a liberated people, a people led by the great Party. The great progress of the motherland's science and technology cannot be stopped by any external force. However, I did feel resentment at the time, thinking that the academic knowledge I had been studying, working hard to delve into, and hoping to bring back to serve the motherland had instead become an obstacle to my return to the motherland. Under the influence of this mood, I decided to "start a new stove" and engage in a new field of study in order to return to the motherland smoothly. I chose engineering cybernetics as a new research object.
    Of course, my changing research topics was somewhat emotional and illogical. Because engineering cybernetics is not something divorced from reality, it is closely related to production process automation, electronic computers, and many defense issues. If the U.S. government wanted to detain me before because I knew a little aerodynamics, they would be even more likely to make things difficult for me when they knew I was studying engineering cybernetics. Fortunately, I was not isolated and helpless. Although I was far across the ocean at that time, I never felt for a moment that I was not a member of the 600 million people of the motherland. Indeed, the power of the people is invincible, and diplomacy with the strength of the people is bound to be victorious. It was precisely because of the victory of our country's diplomacy that I finally returned to the embrace of the motherland in October of the year before last.
    Now, the Chinese Academy of Sciences affirms that my work during this period has value worthy of a prize. How can this not excite me? I can still clearly recall the scene of delving into academics in the United States at that time. My research work was often interrupted by having to "talk" with "investigators" from the U.S. Immigration Bureau. But on the other hand, every piece of news about the construction of the motherland gave me tremendous encouragement. I also did not forget the support given to me by friends with a sense of justice in the United States in my difficult situation at that time. In the school where I was working at the time (California Institute of Technology), there were several American colleagues who did not avoid me because I was a criminal in their own government. On the contrary, they often discussed engineering cybernetics with me. All of these are factors that enabled my research to be successful. Therefore, although I accept the prize from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, this prize ultimately belongs to the 600 million people, to the friends who uphold justice, and to all people who love peace.

    激动地接受科学奖金
    钱学森
    对于我在“工程控制论”方面的研究工作，中国科学院决定给予奖金。我激动地接受这个奖金。我激动的缘故是因为我回想起了在美国做“工程控制论”这个研究工作时候的一段情况。我深深感到祖国的伟大，祖国六亿人民对科学研究的支持。
    我本来不是搞控制论的，我也没有研究过自动控制和自动调节的理论。我以前的专业是对空气动力学、弹性力学、喷气和火箭推进机的研究。那是1950年以前的事，是我在决心回到祖国参加建设以前的事。在1950年的夏天，我要回国，而美国政府找出种种借口，种种莫须有的罪名来千方百计地阻止我离开美国。有人告诉我说，美国政府的行动是因为我的专业与祖国的建设有关，特别是同国防事业有关，美国想通过留难我来阻碍我国科学技术的高速前进。自然，如果这是真的话，那也是白费心机。中华人民共和国的六亿人民是觉醒了的人民，是解放了的人民，是有伟大的党所领导的人民。祖国科学技术事业的大步进展，是不能被任何外来力量所阻止的。可是，我当时确实感到愤恨，想到我一直研究的学术，一直努力钻研，并希望把它带回给祖国服务的学问，反而变成了我回到祖国的障碍。在这种心情的支配下，我决心要“另起炉灶”，搞一门新的学问，以便能顺利回到祖国。我选择了工程控制论作为新的研究对象。
    当然，我换研究题目未免感情用事，不合逻辑。因为工程控制论并不是脱离实际的东西，它与生产过程自动化，与电子计算机，与许多国防问题都有着密切的关系。如果美国政府在以前因为我知道一点空气动力学就要拘留我，当他们知道我研究工程控制论的时候就更要留难我了。所幸我并不是孤立无援的，我当时虽然远隔重洋，但没有一分钟不感到是祖国六亿人民的一分子。诚然，人民的力量是无敌的，有人民力量的外交也是必然要胜利的。正是因为我国外交的胜利，我终于在前年10月间回到祖国的怀抱中来。
    现在，中国科学院肯定我这一个时期的工作有得奖的价值，这怎么能不使我激动呢？我还可以清楚地回想起当时在美国钻研学术的情景，我的研究工作常常因为要和美国移民局的“调查员”“谈话”而被打断。但是在另一面，每一条祖国建设事业的消息，又给我以莫大的鼓舞。我也没有忘了我在当时困难的境地中，美国有正义感的朋友们所给我的支持。在我当时服务的学校里（美国加里福尼亚理工学院），有好几位美国同事，他们不因为我是他们自己政府的罪人而避开我，相反地，他们常常和我讨论工程控制论的问题。所有这一些，都是使我的研究能够成功的因素。因此，我虽然接受中国科学院的奖金，但这奖金归根结蒂是属于六亿人民的，是属于主持正义的朋友们的，是属于一切所有爱好和平的人们的。
