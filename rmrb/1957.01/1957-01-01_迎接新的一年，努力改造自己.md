    Welcoming the New Year, Striving to Remold Ourselves
    Bi Mingqi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Acting Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce
    Today, people across the country are celebrating the arrival of 1957 with unparalleled excitement. As the old saying goes, "A year's plan starts in spring." We in the industrial and commercial sector, while celebrating New Year's Day, should also have a plan for how to strive to complete our tasks in 1957. I would like to offer my personal experiences to friends in the industrial and commercial sector for reference, as a New Year's greeting.
    Since the implementation of the joint state-private ownership of all trades, with the fundamental changes in the relations of production in enterprises, our industrialists and businessmen have also undergone great changes. Our socialist consciousness has been raised to an unprecedented level. After participating in the work of state-owned or joint ventures, we have all become state workers, and generally recognize our future, striving to master our own destiny. Everyone is eager to make progress and prepare conditions for giving up exploitation and changing into laborers. Facts have proved that in the nearly one year since the joint ventures, more and more people have participated in socialist emulation drives, and many have won the honorary titles of advanced producers and advanced workers. Many people have received commendations and rewards. This shows that at present, the ideological mainstream in the industrial and commercial sector is to seek progress and strive to join the ranks of the working class.
  However, it cannot be denied that our ideological remolding of industrialists and businessmen lags far behind the transformation of enterprises. After the joint ownership of all trades, the Party and the government have made appropriate arrangements and considerations for our work and life. However, due to our insufficient study and lack of deep understanding of the policies, we often view problems from the standpoint, viewpoints, and methods of the bourgeoisie, and excessively consider personal interests. When encountering difficulties in our work, we show negative or impatient emotions, and cannot work with peace of mind. This is detrimental to both personal transformation and national construction.
    This situation is mainly manifested in the relationship between public and private partners. After the joint state-private ownership of all trades, a cooperative working relationship among the public, employees, and private sectors emerged within enterprises. Since everyone lacked experience, some problems inevitably arose in this cooperative relationship. After the Party and the government took a series of measures to improve it, the cooperative relationship between the public and private sectors has basically become normal. Only the cooperative relationship between the private sector and employees in some enterprises has not improved. In addition to the insufficient understanding of the peaceful transformation policy implemented by the Party and the government by some employees, one of the main reasons is that the ideological understanding of private personnel cannot keep up with the development of the objective situation. After the joint ownership of all trades, although private personnel have been transformed into state-owned or joint venture workers, due to the long-term exploitation of workers by the private sector in the past, it has caused serious class antagonism. It is impossible to imagine that the class antagonism left over from history can be transformed all at once. Currently, we are still receiving fixed interest, and the class relationship still exists. Therefore, it is natural that the relationship between the private sector and employees cannot be immediately harmonious. Many private personnel, because of insufficient understanding of this dual relationship within joint ventures, do not take the initiative to examine their ideological style and rely on the employee masses to solve problems when encountering difficulties in their work. Instead, they often emphasize that the public sector does not trust them, does not help them, and does not support them, and that employees are prejudiced against them and do not respect their authority. The cooperative relationship between the public and private sectors is often not harmonious because of this. In the minds of some private personnel, there is a sense of inferiority and a guest mentality, showing negativity; some have impatient emotions and are eager to give up fixed interest and remove the capitalist label. These erroneous ideas hinder further personal transformation and the exertion of initiative.
    I believe that negative emotions and the guest mentality are the biggest obstacles to our progress. We must overcome and correct them ideologically. Putting forward the request to give up fixed interest and remove the label is a sign of progress; however, if we think that we can change the employees' perception of us after giving up fixed interest and removing the label, and that we can join the ranks of the working class, it would be too simplistic. If we do not seek fundamental transformation ideologically and strive to "destroy" capitalist ideology and "establish" socialist ideology, even if the label is removed, the employee comrades will not easily change their perception of us, and the trade union will not easily accept us as members.
    Recently, during the Second National Congress of Members of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao once again gave us cordial guidance. Vice Premiers Chen Yun and Bo Yibo also gave us cordial instructions. This meeting made us realize that some problems will inevitably be encountered in the course of progress, enhanced our patriotism and socialist ideological awareness, and recognized that loving ourselves must mean loving the country, and loving the country must mean loving socialism. Only the victorious completion of socialist construction can make the country prosperous and strong, and only then can individuals obtain true happiness. We understood why we must closely integrate personal interests with national interests.
    At this conference, Vice Premiers Chen Yun and Bo Yibo pointed out specific policy issues related to the transformation, such as the seven-year fixed interest rate, the classification of small industrialists and businessmen as petty bourgeoisie, and the continued receipt of fixed interest. At the same time, they also made a correct evaluation of the role played by large, medium, and small industrial and commercial enterprises in the national economy. In this way, not only was the confused thinking of general industrialists and businessmen who demanded to remove their labels and give up fixed interest clarified, but also large, medium, and small industrialists and businessmen could be placed appropriately and be at ease. We deeply feel that the Party and the government's meticulous care and consideration for us are mainly to allow us to have a longer time to study with peace of mind, work with peace of mind, and train ourselves in our work, so as to prepare conditions for giving up exploitation and changing into laborers. We should not fail to live up to the teachings and expectations of the Party and Chairman Mao, and fully exert our positive role.
    Fully exerting our positive role is inseparable from doing a good job in the cooperative relationship between the public and private sectors in enterprises. The key to doing a good job in the cooperative relationship between the public and private sectors lies in how the private personnel work proactively and positively and change the employees' perception of themselves. I believe that in handling the cooperative relationship between the public and private sectors, we must regard state-owned or joint ventures as our own enterprises, establish a sense of ownership, and apply the spirit of diligence and careful calculation in the private sector in the past to run the current state-owned and joint ventures well, and actively participate in socialist emulation drives. At the same time, we must overcome all difficulties, insist on studying policies, studying theories, studying advanced scientific and technological experience, studying socialist management methods, and studying the working class's noble qualities of selflessness and the style of hard work and simple living, serving the people wholeheartedly, so as to prepare conditions for giving up exploitation. Enterprises are the main base for us to carry out transformation, and participating in emulation drives is the most effective way for us to train ourselves through work. Therefore, we must strive to perform meritorious service in the competition and strive to produce more advanced producers and advanced workers. In this way, not only can we make progress quickly, but we can also quickly change the perception of us by the employee masses.
    The fixed interest rate is set for seven years unchanged, and large households with high incomes are naturally overjoyed. However, if we are satisfied with the status quo and relax our self-transformation, it is also wrong. I believe that after we receive fixed interest, in addition to the necessary living expenses, we should use the remaining funds appropriately to do some things that are beneficial to national construction and to the welfare of the people, or purchase public bonds to increase national construction investment, and not use too much of it for consumption. Especially when the market supply is relatively tight, we should not add too much purchasing power to the market. This is also our contribution to the country and a test of our self-transformation and changing employee perceptions.
      Currently, some private personnel still have some difficulties in their lives, and the relevant government departments have taken the necessary measures to help solve them. The industrial and commercial federations will also provide appropriate assistance based on different specific circumstances. We must fully recognize the unity of personal interests and national interests; the improvement of our lives must be based on the development of production.
    Comrades in the industrial and commercial sector, in the past few years since liberation, under the education and leadership of the Communist Party, our ideological awareness has been continuously improved; after the joint ownership of all trades, we have all embraced great confidence and determination to further accept transformation. At present, the Party and the government have properly arranged the necessary environment and conditions for our work and life. Our main task at present is to take active action, unite more closely around the Communist Party, further promote the spirit of patriotism, continue to strengthen self-transformation, earnestly abide by the resolutions of the Second National Congress of Members of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and fully exert our technical talents and management expertise in our production and operation positions, so as to make greater contributions to the socialist construction cause of the motherland.
    I wish all comrades in the industrial and commercial sector progress in the New Year and good health!

    迎接新的一年，努力改造自己
    中华全国工商业联合会副主任委员  天津市工商业联合会代主任委员  毕鸣岐
    今天，全国人民都以无比兴奋的心情祝贺1957年的来临。古语说：“一年之计在于春。”我们工商界在欢渡元旦的今天，对于如何努力完成我们在1957年的任务，也应该有个打算。我愿意把个人的体会提供给工商界的朋友们作参考，聊当新年祝词。
    自从全行业公私合营以后，随着企业生产关系的根本变化，我们工商业者个人也有了很大的变化。我们的社会主义觉悟空前提高，个人在参加国营或合营企业工作后，也都变成为国家的工作人员，一般都认清了自己的前途，为掌握自己的命运而努力。大家迫切要求进步，为将来放弃剥削、改变为劳动者准备条件。事实证明，在合营后将近一年当中，已经有越来越多的人投入社会主义竞赛，不少人获得了先进生产者和先进工作者的荣誉称号，好多人得到了表扬和奖励，这说明了，在目前，工商界中的思想主流，是要求进步的，是为争取进入工人阶级的队伍而努力的。
  但是，不容讳言，我们工商业者的思想改造还远远落后在企业改造的后面，在全业合营以后，党和政府对我们的工作、生活都作了适当的安排和照顾；但是，由于我们学习不够，对政策体会不深，往往仍用资产阶级的立场、观点、方法看问题，过多地考虑个人利益。在工作中遇到一些困难的时候，就表现出消极或急燥的情绪，不能安心工作。这对个人改造和国家建设都很不利。　　这种情况，主要表现在公私共事关系上。在全行业合营以后，企业内部出现了公方、职工、私方三方面的合作共事关系。由于大家都缺乏经验，在这种共事关系中，不可避免地出现了一些问题。党和政府采取了一系列的措施加以改进后，公私之间的共事关系基本上已趋向正常，只有部分企业内的私方和职工之间的共事关系还没有改善。除了部分职工对于党和政府执行的和平改造政策认识不够外，主要原因之一是私方人员思想认识跟不上客观形势的发展。全业合营后，私方人员虽然已经改变为国营或合营企业的工作人员，但由于私方过去长时期对工人进行着剥削，造成了严重的阶级对立的恶感，现在不可能设想把这个历史上遗留下来的阶级恶感一下子转变过来。目前我们还拿着定息，阶级关系依然是存在的。因此，私方和职工的关系不能立刻融洽起来，也是很自然的。好多私方人员，因为对合营企业内这种双重关系认识不足，以致在工作中遇到困难的时候，不是主动地检查自己的思想作风，依靠职工群众解决问题，而往往强调公方对他们不信任，不帮助，不支持，职工对他们有成见，不尊重他们的职权。公私共事关系常常因此搞得不够融洽。在有的私方人员的思想上，存在着自卑感和作客思想，表现消极；有的有急燥情绪，急于要求放弃定息、摘掉资本家帽子。这些错误思想，都阻碍了个人的进一步改造和积极性的发挥。
    我认为：消极情绪、作客思想，是我们进步的最大障碍。必须从思想上克服它、纠正它。提出放弃定息、摘掉帽子的要求，是进步的表现；但是，如果认为在放弃定息、摘掉帽子以后就可以改变职工群众的观感，就可以加入工人阶级的队伍，就未免过于简单化了。我们如果不从思想上求得根本改造，努力
  “破”资本主义思想，“立”社会主义思想，尽管帽子摘了，职工同志们对我们的观感也不能很容易地改变过来的，工会也不会轻易吸收我们入会的。
    最近，在全国工商联召开的第二届会员代表大会期间，中共中央和毛主席又一次对我们进行了亲切的教导。陈云、薄一波两位副总理也向我们作了亲切的指示。这次会议使我们认识到，在前进中不可避免地会遇到一些问题，提高了我们的爱国主义和社会主义思想觉悟，认识到爱自己必须爱国家，爱国家必须爱社会主义，只有社会主义建设胜利完成才能使国家富强繁荣起来，也才能使个人得到真正的幸福，懂得了我们为什么必须把个人利益同国家利益密切地结合起来。
    在这次大会上，陈云、薄一波副总理指出了定息七年不变，小型工商业者可以划为小资产阶级、定息仍旧可拿等等有关改造的具体政策问题，同时还对大中小工商业在国民经济中所起的作用作了正确的评价。这样，不但澄清了一般工商业者要求摘帽子、放弃定息的混乱思想，并且也使大中小工商业者都能各得其所，各安其心。我们深切感到：党和政府对我们这样无微不至的关怀和照顾，主要是为了让我们能有一个较长的时间安心学习，安心工作，在工作中锻练自己，为放弃剥削、改变为劳动者准备条件。我们不应辜负党和毛主席的教导和期待，充分发挥我们的积极作用。
    充分发挥积极作用，同搞好企业中的公私共事关系是分不开的。搞好公私共事关系的关键，在于私方人员如何主动地积极地工作，改变职工群众对自己的观感。我认为，我们在处理公私共事关系上，必须把国营或合营企业看作自己的企业，树立起主人翁的态度，把过去在私营时期兢兢业业、精打细算的精神，施展在办好现在的国营和合营企业中来，积极地投入社会主义竞赛。同时，还要克服一切困难，坚持学习政策，学习理论，学习先进的科学技术经验，学习社会主义的经营管理方法，学习工人阶级的大公无私的高贵品质和艰苦朴素全心全意为人民服务的作风，为放弃剥削准备好条件。企业是我们进行改造的主要基地，参加竞赛又是我们通过工作锻炼自己的最有效的方法。因此，我们要争取在竞赛中立功，争取出现更多的先进生产者和先进工作者。这样，不仅自己能很快地进步，同时也能很快地使职工群众对我们的观感改变过来。
    定息定为七年不变，收入多的大户自然是喜出望外。但是，我们如果满于现状，放松了自我改造，也是不对的。我认为，我们拿到定息以后，除生活上的必要开支外，应该拿余款适当地做一些有利于国家建设和为人民谋福利的事业，或购买公债增加国家建设投资，而不要过多地用到消费方面去。尤其是在市场供应比较紧张的时候，更不要给市场上增加过多的购买力。这同样是我们对国家的贡献，也是我们进行自我改造和改变职工观感的一种考验。
      目前有一部分私方人员在生活上还存在着一些困难问题，政府有关方面已经采取了必要的措施帮助解决。有些困难，工商联组织也将要根据不同的具体情况给以适当的帮助。我们必须充分认识到个人利益和国家利益的一致性；我们生活的改善，必须建立在生产发展的基础上。
    工商界的同志们，解放几年来，我们在共产党的教育和领导下，思想觉悟不断提高；全业合营以后，我们都抱着很大的信心和决心进一步接受改造。目前，党和政府已经给我们妥善安排了工作和生活上所必需的环境和条件。我们当前的主要任务，就是要积极行动起来，更加紧密地团结在共产党的周围，进一步发扬爱国主义精神，继续加强自我改造，切实遵守全国工商联第二届会员代表大会的决议，在生产经营的工作岗位上，充分发挥自己的技术才能和经营管理的特长，为祖国的社会主义建设事业做出更大的贡献。
    谨祝工商界同志们新年进步，身体健康！
