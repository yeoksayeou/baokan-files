    Three Villages in Qinghai Build Small Hydropower Stations
    (Our report) Three agricultural cooperatives in Dongyuantan Village of Minhe County, Xinbaozi Village of Ledu County, and Kalu Village of Huangyuan County, Qinghai Province, are building three small hydropower stations. The water volume of these three hydropower stations is relatively abundant. At present, the plant buildings, water diversion projects, and power transmission projects of these three power stations have been completed, and nearly 3,000 electric lights have been installed for more than 1,800 farming households. Once the generators are delivered, they can be installed for power generation. In addition to providing lighting, these three power stations can also pump water to irrigate more than 6,000 mu of highland, and can also use electricity to process agricultural products. In order to master the technology of managing power stations, the agricultural cooperatives in the three places have sent excellent members to the Xining Power Plant to study.

    青海三个村建设小型水电站
    本报讯　青海省民和县东塬滩、乐都县新堡子、湟源县卡路等三个村的农业社正在建设三处小型水电站。这三处水电站的水量都比较充沛。目前这三处电站的厂房工程、引水工程、输电工程等都已完成，并为一千八百多个农户安装了近三千盏电灯。等发电机运到后，即可安装发电。这三处电站除供照明之用外，还可抽水灌溉高地六千多亩，也可利用电力进行农产品的加工。为了掌握管理电站的技术，三个地方的农业社已派了优秀的社员到西宁电厂学习。　（刘自箴）
