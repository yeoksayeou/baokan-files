By Comparison
    Yu Ming
    On the same afternoon, I heard about two things.
    The first was that the comrades of the Anhui Provincial Higher People's Court have consistently maintained a thrifty style. After 1954, their workload became increasingly heavy, but their administrative and operational expenses decreased year by year. In 1956, their administrative and operational expenses were more than 10,000 yuan less than in 1955. Seventy-two of the seventy-nine people in this unit participated in savings, and for several months the monthly savings balance accounted for more than 50% of the total salary of the entire court. I felt this was a very significant matter. Just imagine, if staff across the country could do this, how much help would that be to national construction!
    How could they achieve such results? The head of the court's general affairs section told me a very simple truth. He said, "For an office of more than seventy people to save ten thousand yuan a year is not easy, because now many expenses are permitted by the state. As long as you don't exceed the regulations, no one will say you are wasting money if you spend it. However, within these prescribed limits, as long as everyone consciously saves anytime and anywhere, then saving ten thousand yuan a year is not very difficult." He gave me many examples. He said that the court has a car, and if the leaders usually take the car to and from work and to meetings, no one would complain. Because this is something everyone is used to. However, their leading comrades do not readily use the car. This saves gasoline and car repair costs. Some long-distance calls are necessary, but as long as the comrades are mindful of saving, some things can be done two days earlier, and a letter can solve the problem. He said, take the smallest thing as an example. If you hire someone to deliver something from the city, it will cost money, but if you do it yourself, you can save a sum of money for the country. And the comrades in their office have a habit of doing things themselves. He finally said, "Saving depends entirely on the comrades' consciousness!" This remark has a very simple principle, but it made a deep impression on me.
    The second thing was the "symposium" held by the Wuhu City Catering Company at the Tongqinglou Restaurant. Last December, two directors and four staff members from the Anhui Provincial Department of Commerce went to Wuhu to inspect the work. The director asked the person in charge of the catering company, have you held a food and beverage symposium? The person in charge of the company said, "We are currently fighting waste, and we haven't dared to do it." But the director said, "It also depends on business needs!" The person in charge of the company became bolder after hearing this, and set up three tables of banquets at the Tongqinglou Restaurant to hold a "symposium." On the table, there were pipa pork ribs, phoenix cured meat, hibiscus chicken slices, jadeite shaomai… a total of seventeen famous dishes and snacks. In addition to talking about the supply problems of the catering company, the opinions of the people attending the symposium on these big dishes were quite unique. The opinions were written on paper, and there were many wonderful sentences among them: "Quaint and elegant!" "Suitable for wine and rice!" "Good!" "Chinese cuisine is famous for its color, aroma, and taste, and today I have increased my knowledge in this regard!" ... This is extremely elegant.
    I couldn't help but compare the above two situations. The former is saving every penny within the scope of state-allowed spending; the latter is spending lavishly under the pretext of "business needs." The former is consistent in saving for several years, regardless of whether there is a saving campaign; the latter is completely unmoved even knowing the call for saving.
    From the comparison of these two situations, I feel even more the importance of what the head of the general affairs section said. Every one of us state employees has our own scope of responsibilities, and if we spend lavishly under a pretext, there will always be excuses to borrow.
    Consciously saving is such a noble act. However, from this we can also see that this virtue is still something that needs to be cultivated by some of our comrades!

    相形之下

    在同一天的下午，我听说了两件事。
    头一件事，是安徽省高级人民法院的同志们一贯节约成风。1954年以后，他们的工作越来越繁重，但是行政费和事业费却一年比一年节省，1956年的行政费和事业费就比1955年节约了一万多元。这个单位的七十九个人，有七十二个人参加了储蓄，而且数月来每月的存款余额都占全院工资总额的50％以上。我感到这是件很大的事情。试想，如果全国各地的机关工作人员，都能像他们这样，对国家建设的帮助该有多大！
    他们怎能作出这样的成绩呢？法院的总务科长对我讲了一个很普通的道理。他说：“一个七十多人的机关，一年节约万把块钱，说来不容易，因为现在有许多开支是国家允许的。只要不超过规定，花了钱也没有人说你浪费。可是，在这些规定的范围里，只要大家都随时随地自觉地节约，那么一年节约万把块钱，也是不很难的。”他举了许多例子给我听。他说，法院是有小汽车的，要是负责人平常都坐汽车上下班，去开会，总不会有人责难。因为这已是大家都看惯了的。可是，他们的负责同志们却不轻易乘用汽车。这既省了汽油，又节省了汽车修理费。打长途电话，有些是必要的，可是同志们只要有心节约，有些事是可以早办两天的，这样写封信也就解决了。他说，就拿最小的事说吧，从市上买东西回来，要是雇人送就得花钱，可是自己动动手，就可为国家节约一笔钱。而他们机关的同志们，是有亲自动手的习惯的。他最后说：“节约，这完全要靠同志们的自觉！”这番话，道理很简单，可是给我的印象很深。
    第二件事，是芜湖市饮食业公司在同庆楼饭店召开“座谈”会的事。去年12月，安徽省商业厅有两个处长带着四个工作人员，到芜湖检查工作。处长问饮食公司的负责人，你们开过饮食品座谈会了吗？公司负责人说：“目前正在反浪费，没敢搞。”而处长却说：“也要看业务需要啊！”公司负责人听了这话，胆子壮起来了，就在同庆楼饭店摆起三桌宴席，举行“座谈”。席上，琵琶排骨、凤凰腊肉、芙蓉鸡片、翡翠烧卖……共计摆了名菜名点十七种。参加座谈的人们，除了谈谈对饮食公司的供应问题外，对这些大菜的“座谈”意见却是别开生面的。意见写在纸上，其中有不少妙句：“古色古香！”“可酒可饭！”“好！”“中国菜素以色、香、味闻名，今天增加了我在这方面的知识！”……这真是文雅之极。
    我不由得把以上两种情况作了一番对照。前一种，是在国家允许花钱的范围内一点一滴地节约；后一种，是借“业务需要”，大肆挥霍。前一种是，不管有没有节约运动，数年来始终一贯节约；后一种是，知道节约的号召，也完全无动于中。
    从这两种情况的比较中，我就更加感到那个总务科长所说的话的重要了。我们每个国家工作人员都有自己的职责范围，要是借题挥霍，那是不患无辞可借的。
    自觉地节约，这是多么高尚的行为。可是，从这里也可看出，这种美德，对我们有些同志来说，还是一件多么需要锻炼的事情啊！
