Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 28th. Xinhua News Agency reporters Shen Ping and Yang Shaoshan report: More than 300,000 cadres above the level of production team leader in agricultural production cooperatives throughout Liaoning Province were tempered in the process of establishing advanced cooperatives last year, and their ability to run cooperatives and their work level have greatly improved. The majority of these cadres have initially mastered the basic policies and knowledge of running cooperatives and have learned the skills of running cooperatives. Now, they have become the backbone force for running agricultural cooperatives well and building a new socialist countryside.

The advanced agricultural cooperativization movement in Liaoning Province has developed on the basis of mutual aid and cooperation in the past few years. There are currently more than 10,300 advanced cooperatives that have been built after expanding and merging cooperatives. Most of the cadres participating in leading these cooperatives have held leadership positions in the past mutual aid teams and elementary cooperatives, have learned some skills in leading cooperatives, and have explored some experience. However, due to the large-scale development of advanced cooperatives last year, especially these advanced cooperatives of a completely socialist nature, their management methods, labor organization, and financial management are different from those of the past mutual aid teams and elementary cooperatives. Therefore, under the new circumstances, community cadres generally felt that they had no experience and lacked methods in how to lead advanced cooperatives, and it was inevitable that some shortcomings and errors occurred in their work. In order to continuously change this situation, over the past year, party and government leading departments at all levels in Liaoning Province have adopted the method of holding various forms of training courses to improve cadres' ability to run cooperatives. According to statistics from more than 20 cities and counties in the Jinzhou and Liaoyang special districts, more than 100,000 cooperative directors, deputy directors, management committee members, production team leaders, and accountants have been trained. The training methods and content mainly focus on helping them summarize experiences and lessons, improve their ideological level, further mobilize their enthusiasm, and improve the management of the community. After training, the work level of many cadres has improved to varying degrees. Last spring, on average, only three cadres in each community in the Jinzhou Special District could initially grasp the basic policies and knowledge of running a community. Now, on average, more than a dozen cadres in each community can grasp the basic policies and knowledge of running a community. Ninety percent of the production team leaders in the entire special district are competent for their positions.

In addition to holding various training courses to train cadres, all localities generally pay attention to adopting the method of mentoring apprentices in actual work to cultivate and improve cadres. Many counties, districts, and townships have established key communities, and communities have established key teams. After gaining experience through pilot projects, they organize cadres to study and promote them in an all-round way. This approach has achieved good results. Many cadres in Tieling County felt that setting up a community in the spring was like "knocking on the door," and by the autumn, they had entered the door. This county also benefited greatly from adopting the method of "doing, learning, summarizing, and promoting simultaneously" in various tasks.

At present, Liaoning Province has started the work of rectifying agricultural cooperatives to consolidate the achievements of agricultural cooperativization and continue to improve the ability of community cadres to run cooperatives.

    在农业合作化的过程中受到锻炼
    辽宁三十万社干部工作水平提高
    据新华社沈阳28日电　新华社记者沈平、杨绍山报道：辽宁省全省农业生产合作社的三十多万个生产队长以上的干部，在去年一年办高级社的过程中受到锻炼，办社能力和工作水平都有很大提高。这些干部中，大多数人都初步掌握了办社的基本政策和知识，学会了办社的本领。现在，他们已经成为办好农业社和建设社会主义新农村的骨干力量。
    辽宁省高级农业合作化运动是在过去几年互助合作基础上发展起来的。经过扩社、并社而后建成的高级社目前有一万零三百多个。参加领导这些社的干部，绝大部分都在过去的互助组、初级社中担任过领导职务，学到一些领导办社的本领，摸索出了一些经验。但是，由于去年大规模发展高级社，尤其是这种完全社会主义性质的高级社，经营方式、劳动组织、财务管理和过去互助组、初级社都不相同，因此，在新的情况下，社干部们对如何领导高级社，普遍感到没有经验，缺乏办法，在工作中难以避免地发生过一些缺点和错误。为了不断改变这种情况，一年来，辽宁省各级党、政领导部门采用举办各种形式训练班的办法，来提高干部的办社工作能力。据锦州、辽阳两个专区二十几个市、县统计，经过训练的合作社主任、副主任、管理委员会委员、生产队长、会计等就有十万多人。训练的方法和内容主要是帮助他们总结经验教训，提高思想水平，进一步发挥他们的积极性，搞好社的经营管理工作等。许多干部经过训练后，办社工作水平都有不同程度的提高。锦州专区各县去年春季平均每个社只有三个干部能够初步掌握办社的基本政策和知识，现在平均每个社就有十几个干部能掌握办社的基本政策和知识。全专区90％的生产队长都能胜任本身的职务。
    除了举办各种训练班训练干部以外，各地一般都很注意在实际工作中采取带徒弟的办法培养和提高干部。很多县、区、乡都建立了重点社，社建立了重点队，通过试点取得经验后再组织干部学习，全面推广。这样做效果很好。铁岭县许多干部感到春天办社是“蒙门”，到了秋天就入了门。这个县在各项工作中采用“边做、边学、边总结、边推广”的办法，收效也很大。
    目前，辽宁省开始了整顿农业社工作，以巩固农业合作化的成就，继续提高社干部的办社能力。
