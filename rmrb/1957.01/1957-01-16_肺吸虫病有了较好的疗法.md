Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, January 15th: More than 180 patients have been cured of paragonimiasis, a stubborn and difficult-to-treat parasitic disease, by members of the Zhejiang Provincial Paragonimiasis Treatment Research Technical Committee.

    Paragonimiasis is a local parasitic disease. It has strong mobility and can parasitize in human lungs, brain tissue or abdomen. Patients with paragonimiasis usually have symptoms of coughing, rusty sputum, and fever. Patients gradually lose their ability to work or die from excessive hemoptysis. If the worm is in the brain tissue, it can cause lesions in the brain or spinal cord, causing disability or even death. Moreover, because its symptoms have many similarities with other diseases, it is generally not easy to diagnose.

    After accepting the treatment and research task of 204 paragonimiasis patients who had not been cured for a long time, transferred from various places by the Ministry of Health in February 1954, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Health designated the Zhejiang Second Rehabilitation Hospital to accommodate this group of patients, and invited relevant experts, professors, and doctors to form the Zhejiang Provincial Paragonimiasis Treatment Research Technical Committee, under the leadership of the nationally renowned parasitology expert Professor Hong Shilu (deceased), to conduct clinical treatment and research work.

    In the past, western medicines such as emetine or chloroquine were used alone to treat paragonimiasis at home and abroad, but because the treatment reaction of using this medicine alone was very large, it could not be used much, so the efficacy was not high for late-stage patients. This time, the Zhejiang Provincial Paragonimiasis Treatment Research Technical Committee successively tried eight drugs, including chloroquine and emetine, and treated them with thirteen different methods. The results proved that the treatment effect of emetine combined with chloroquine was the highest, with a cure rate of 90.9%. Now, this committee has compiled its clinical treatment and research experience into a book for researchers in various places to refer to.

    肺吸虫病有了较好的疗法
    新华社杭州15日电　一种顽固难治的寄生虫病——肺吸虫病，已经被浙江省肺吸虫病治疗研究技术委员会的人员治愈一百八十多名。
    肺吸虫病是一种地方性的寄生虫病，它的活动能力很强，可以寄生在人的肺部、脑组织或腹部。得了肺吸虫病的病人，通常的症状是咳嗽、吐铁锈色血痰和发热，病人逐渐失去劳动力或因吐血过多而死亡。如果虫在脑组织里，可以引起脑或脊髓的病变，造成残废甚至死亡。又因它的症状同其他病症有很多相似之处，一般情况下不易诊断。
    浙江省卫生厅在1954年2月接受卫生部从各地调来的二百零四名久治未愈的肺吸虫病人的治疗研究任务后，即指定浙江省第二康复医院收容这批病人，并且邀请有关专家、教授、医师组成浙江省肺吸虫病治疗研究技术委员会，在全国著名的寄生虫专家洪式闾教授（已故）主持下，进行临床治疗和研究工作。
    过去国内外曾单独采用西药吐根素或氯化奎林来治疗肺吸虫病，但由于单独使用这种药物治疗反应很大，不能多用，所以对晚期病人疗效不高。这次浙江省肺吸虫病治疗研究技术委员会，先后试用氯化奎林、吐根素等八种药物，分十三种不同的方法治疗的结果，证明以吐根素合并氯化奎林的治疗效果最高，治愈率达90.9％。现在这个委员会已把临床治疗和研究经验编成一书，供各地研究者作参考。
