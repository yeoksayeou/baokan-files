    Love the Army, Love the Government, Love the People
    Party, Government, Army, and People Help Each Other
    Achievements Made in the Fuzhou Area
    Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 14th -- The organs and troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Fuzhou area received a great deal of assistance from the local Party and government organs in the past year.
    Last year, the business departments of the leading organs of the PLA troops stationed in the Fuzhou area were often invited to send representatives to many meetings of Fujian Province and Fuzhou City. The representatives learned a lot about the situation and gained a lot of knowledge from these meetings. After the officers and soldiers of a certain organ began their "March towards Science" study, professors and lecturers from various universities and colleges in Fuzhou often came to teach them scientific knowledge. In recent months, when various units of the troops were studying the documents of the "Eighth National Congress," ministers of the CPC Fujian Provincial Committee were invited to give several special reports to the officers on industrial and agricultural issues and the Party's united front policy, which greatly helped the troops' study. State-owned commercial companies in Fujian Province and Fuzhou City ensured the supply of non-staple foods and materials for the troops. Local public security departments also regularly informed relevant units of the troops about the social security situation they had learned about and jointly studied and dealt with it.
    The officers and soldiers of the troops were very grateful for the help of the local Party and government organs and responded to this care with practical actions. Last spring, when the handicraft cooperation in Fuzhou City entered a climax, the leading organs of the garrison troops drew a group of cadres from various units to form a work team to assist the local government in promoting this work. Some units often sent cadres to cooperatives to understand the situation and show movies to the members. When a certain organ of the troops learned that the local Foreign Affairs Office was unable to supply bricks for the construction of houses, it lent hundreds of thousands of bricks that were temporarily unused by the unit to the Foreign Affairs Office. When Fuzhou City was short of electricity, the units of the garrison troops quickly took measures to save electricity for lighting so that the city could increase the supply of electricity for production. Before the New Year, when the troops found that the supply of pork in the market was in short supply, they automatically reduced the amount of pork purchased from the market.

    Medical Personnel on the Fujian Front Frequently Treat the People
    Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 16th -- Seventy-five medical personnel from the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops on the Fujian Front set off on the 15th to treat schistosomiasis for the people of Fuqing County.
    Medical personnel in the PLA Fujian Front troops had already helped the people in the駐地 area with a lot of disease prevention and control work last year. According to statistics from some medical units, they treated more than 14,200 people and vaccinated more than 1,400 people. Medical personnel from many troops often went deep into the people to understand the situation and immediately gave treatment when they found patients. Last September, when Tongan, Quanzhou, and other areas suffered from floods, the garrison hospitals and health units sent a group of medical personnel, carrying medicines, to many places to treat the victims. Medical personnel from many units also often explained common sense of epidemic prevention and hygiene to the people in their驻地 area, or helped them to tidy up the indoor and outdoor environmental hygiene. The troop hospitals stationed in Zhangzhou, Longyan, and other places also trained a group of health workers for the local agricultural production cooperatives.

    "New Zili Cantonese Opera Troupe" Crosses the Sea to Perform for Soldiers
    Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, 15th -- A folk troupe from Zhanjiang Prefecture, Guangdong Province -- the "New Zili Cantonese Opera Troupe" -- performed for the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed on Hainan Island from the 2nd to the 13th as a gesture of consolation.
    During the consolation performances, the troupe, from the elderly artists in their fifties to the young actors of fourteen or fifteen years old, fully demonstrated their spirit of loving the People's Army and actively serving the soldiers. Disregarding the wind and waves, they crossed the sea to two small islands one after another and gave five consecutive performances for the soldiers who could not see dramas all year round, and held two get-together parties with the soldiers. The actors bought cigarettes and candies to give to the soldiers, and the actresses also asked to sew and wash clothes for the soldiers. When they performed consolation performances in the army's hospital, they went deep into the wards to give small-scale consolation a cappella performances to seriously ill patients who could not watch the performances.
    The troupe was warmly welcomed by the vast number of officers and soldiers. The soldiers guarding the island gave their houses to the actors to live in, and treated the "guests" with pigs and sheep they raised, vegetables they cultivated, and coconuts. Many officers and soldiers also gave the actors souvenirs of Hainan Island's treasures -- corals and shells. The officers and soldiers wrote in letters to the troupe that they must better defend the motherland and repay the people's care and consolation.

    爱军队  爱政府  爱人民
    党政军民相互帮助
    福州地区作得有成绩
    据新华社福建前线14日电中国人民解放军驻福州地区的机关、部队，在过去一年中得到当地党、政机关很多的帮助。
    解放军驻福州地区部队领导机关各业务部门，去年常常应邀派代表出席福建省和福州市的许多会议，代表们从这些会议中了解了很多情况，学到了不少知识。某机关的官兵在开始“向科学进军”的学习后，福州市各高等学校的教授和讲师，常常来向他们讲授科学知识。最近几个月部队各单位在学习“八大”文件时，中共福建省委的部长们应邀向军官作了工业、农业问题和党的统一战线政策等几次专门报告，对部队的学习帮助很大。福建省和福州市的国营商业公司，保证了部队副食品和物资的供应。地方公安部门也经常把它们了解到的社会治安情况告诉给部队有关单位，共同研究处理。
    部队官兵对地方党、政机关的帮助十分感激，纷纷用实际行动答谢这种关怀。去年春天，在福州市的手工业合作化进入高潮时，驻军领导机关就从各单位抽出一批干部，组成工作队，协助地方政府推进这项工作。有些单位还常常派出干部到合作社内了解情况，并且给社员放映电影。部队某机关知道地方交际处建造房屋砖头供应不上时，便把本单位暂时不用的几十万块砖借给交际处使用。福州市电力不足时，驻军各单位便迅速采取措施，节约照明用电，以便市内能够增加供应生产用电。新年前，部队发现市场上的猪肉供不应求时，便自动减少向市场购买猪肉的数量。
    福建前线医务人员常给人民群众治病
    据新华社福建前线16日电福建前线中国人民解放军部队的七十五名医务工作人员，在15日出发到福清县为人民群众医治血吸虫病。
    解放军福建前线部队中的医务工作人员，在去年就曾经帮助驻地人民做了很多防治疾病的工作。据一部分医务单位的统计，共给人民群众治病一万四千二百多人次，给一千四百多人注射了疫苗。很多部队的医务工作人员经常深入人民群众中了解，一发现病人当即给予诊治。去年9月，当同安、泉州等地区遭受水灾的时候，驻军医院和卫生单位都派出了一批医务人员，携带药品，分散到许多地方给灾民治病。不少单位的医务人员还时常给驻地人民讲解防疫卫生常识，或者帮助他们整理室内室外的环境卫生。驻漳州、龙岩等地的部队医院，还给当地农业生产合作社训练了一批卫生保健员。
    “新自力粤剧团”渡海为战士演出
    新华社海口15日电　广东省湛江专区的一个民间剧团——“新自力粤剧团”，2日到13日向驻守海南岛的中国人民解放军部队进行了慰问演出。
    这个剧团在慰问演出过程中，从五十多岁的老艺人到十四、五岁的小演员，都充分表现了热爱人民军队、积极为兵服务的精神。他们不顾风浪，先后漂海到两个小岛上，为终年看不到戏剧的战士们连续演出了五场，并且和战士们举行了两次联欢晚会。演员们买了香烟、糖果送给战士们，女演员还要求给战士们缝洗衣服。他们在部队的医院里慰问演出的时候，深入病房给没能观看演出的重病员进行了小型的慰问清唱。
    这个剧团受到广大官兵的热烈欢迎。守卫在岛上的战士们把自己住的房子让给演员们住，用自己喂养的猪羊、开荒种植的青菜和椰子等招待“客人”。许多部队的官兵还将海南岛的珍品——珊瑚和贝壳赠给演员们留念。官兵们在写给剧团的信上表示：一定要更好地保卫祖国，答谢人民的关怀和慰问。
