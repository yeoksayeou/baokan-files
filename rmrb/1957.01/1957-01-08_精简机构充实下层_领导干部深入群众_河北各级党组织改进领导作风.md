Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 6th - Communist Party organizations at all levels in Hebei Province are taking various measures to vigorously improve their leadership style.

    The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has already transferred nearly 300 cadres at or above the level of section chief from provincial departments to various counties to assist in their work. The Tianjin Local Committee of the Communist Party of China also transferred 112 cadres with rich experience in rural work from departments in the special districts to the district level in late December of last year to serve as deputy secretaries of district Party committees, deputy district heads, and so on. The work of streamlining the upper levels and enriching the lower levels is also beginning in various counties. According to statistics from eight counties in seven special districts, including Cangxian, Baoding, and Tangshan, more than 280 cadres have been transferred to work in districts and townships. After the streamlining, these counties have generally added one district committee-level cadre to each township, which has strengthened leadership over basic-level work.
    Not long ago, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed Party organizations in disaster areas to conduct a major inspection of the living conditions of the people in disaster areas. At the same time, it also transferred 70 cadres from provincial departments to form working teams, led by department and section chiefs, to visit disaster victims in disaster areas. Secretaries of the Communist Party committees and commissioners of various special districts also led large numbers of cadres deep into the disaster areas to help district and township cadres promptly identify and solve problems existing in the production and lives of the people in the disaster areas. Cadres sent to the countryside in Quzhou, Daming, and two other counties in Handan Special District discovered, through holding forums, visiting households, and conducting on-the-spot observations, that more than 13,000 households of disaster victims were experiencing difficulties in their lives, and then issued 76,500 yuan in relief funds to these disaster victims.
    The Communist Party committees of Jingxian, Renqiu, and other counties also convened meetings of Party members and cadres to examine the working style of the mass line. At the same time, Party organizations at all levels below the county level also held forums with Party members, cadres, and elderly farmers to solicit opinions from lower-level cadres and the masses of farmers and to improve work based on the opinions of the masses.

    精简机构充实下层　领导干部深入群众
    河北各级党组织改进领导作风
    据新华社保定6日电　中共河北省各级组织正在采取各种措施，大力改进领导作风。
    中共河北省委员会已经从省级各部门抽调了近三百名处长级以上干部分配到各县去帮助工作。中共天津地方委员会也在去年12月下旬从专区各部门抽调了一百一十二名农村工作经验丰富的干部，到区级担任中共区委副书记、副区长等职务。各县精简上层充实下层的工作也在开始进行。据沧县、保定、唐山等七个专区八个县的统计，调到区、乡工作的干部已经有二百八十多人。这些县经过精简以后，使每个乡一般都增添了一名区委级干部，这就加强了对基层工作的领导。
    不久以前，中共河北省委员会曾指示灾区党组织对灾区人民的生活情况进行了一次大检查。同时还从省级各部门抽调了七十名干部组成工作队，由厅、处长级干部带领分赴灾区访问灾民。各专区的中共地委书记、专员等也带领大批干部深入灾区，帮助区、乡干部及时发现和解决灾区人民生产和生活中存在的问题。邯郸专区曲周、大名等四个县下乡的干部，经过开座谈会、到户访问和实地观察，发现有一万三千多户灾民生活有困难，于是便向这些灾民补发了七万六千五百元赈款。
    中共景县、任丘等县委员会还召开党员干部会议，检查群众路线的工作作风。同时县以下各级党组织也召开了党员、干部以及老年农民座谈会，征求下级干部和农民群众的意见，根据群众意见来改进工作。
