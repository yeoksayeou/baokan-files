    Young teaching assistants and lab technicians in the Radio Physics Teaching and Research Section of the Physics Department at Peking University actively advocate assembling instruments themselves. Lab technician Wang Yishu has preliminarily completed the trial assembly of a wide-band oscillator. This wide-band oscillator has a higher frequency than those purchased, and assembling one can save the state around 300 yuan. Xinhua News Agency reporter Fu Jun photo

    北京大学物理系无线电物理教研室的青年助教和实验员，积极倡议自己动手装配仪器。实验员王义述进行宽频振荡器的试装已初步完成。这架宽频振荡器比买来的频率还要高，装一台就可为国家节约三百元左右。　新华社记者　傅军摄
