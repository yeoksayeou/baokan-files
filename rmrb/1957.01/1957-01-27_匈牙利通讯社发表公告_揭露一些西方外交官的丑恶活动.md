Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 26th - The Hungarian News Agency published an announcement on the 25th, saying: There is a rumor circulating in Budapest that the U.S. Embassy in Budapest, with the help of the French Embassy, convened a meeting of diplomatic representatives from certain Western countries stationed in Hungary. At the meeting, based on a proposal from the Americans, it was decided that some diplomatic personnel, acting as so-called "volunteer observers," would compile reports on the situation in Hungary.

This news has aroused unpleasant reactions in Budapest, especially since the U.S. Embassy had just dismantled two radio transmitters. It is also known that the British military attaché has been deported for having connections with counter-revolutionaries.

After futile attempts by the United Nations to interfere in Hungary, some Western diplomatic representatives stationed in Hungary are now establishing such a temporary alliance, apparently seeking to exploit, or rather abuse, their positions to find new excuses to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs. The Hungarian News Agency's announcement pointed out that this type of situation is almost unprecedented in diplomatic history and violates the unwritten moral code of international relations. This action by Western diplomats is "clearly an unfriendly act towards the hospitable country."

The announcement said that this cannot help but lead one to the assumption that the diplomatic personnel playing a role in this matter are not trying to help, but rather, on the contrary, are trying to hinder their own countries from establishing good relations with the Hungarian People's Republic.

### 匈牙利通讯社发表公告  揭露一些西方外交官的丑恶活动

    匈牙利通讯社发表公告
    揭露一些西方外交官的丑恶活动
    新华社布达佩斯26日电　匈牙利通讯社25日发表公告说：布达佩斯正流传着这样一种消息：美国驻布达佩斯使馆在法国使馆的帮助下，召开了某些西方国家驻匈牙利外交代表的会议。在会议上，根据美国人的提议，决定由一些外交人员以所谓“志愿观察员”的身分编写关于匈牙利局势的报告书。
    这个消息在布达佩斯引起了不愉快的反应，尤其是美国使馆刚刚拆除了两台无线电发射机。大家还知道，英国武官由于同反革命分子有联系已经被遣送出境了。
    在联合国枉费心机地企图干涉匈牙利之后，某些西方国家驻匈牙利外交代表又来建立这样一个临时的联合，显然是为了想利用、或更确切地说是想滥用自己的职位来寻找新的借口，试图干涉匈牙利内政。匈牙利通讯社的公告指出，这类情况在外交史上几乎是没有前例的，而且是违反国际交往中不成文的道德规范的，西方外交家的这种行动“对好客的国家显然是一种不友好的举动”。
    公告说，这就不由得使人作这样的设想：在这件事中担任某种角色的外交人员不是想帮助，而恰巧相反地是想阻碍他们自己的国家同匈牙利人民共和国建立良好的关系。
