Ideological Battlefield Memorandum
　　　　Qin Mu
　　On the battlefield, besides positional warfare, there are also guerrilla warfare, tunnel warfare, and skirmishes. I think in the ideological battlefield, there is no exception.

　　In history and in life, many things that seem insignificant on the surface actually embody the fierce struggle of various class ideologies.

　　Recently, I read people's narratives about things before the Xinhai Revolution, mentioning that in the late Qing Dynasty, in some rural areas of the provinces, children were playing the game of "Catching Sun Wen, Catching Huang Xing." One or two people扮acted as Mr. Sun Yat-sen and Huang Xing, and other children would come to catch them. I think that at that time, village children in remote areas would not understand who Mr. Sun Yat-sen was, and ordinary villagers would not come up with such a game. Needless to say, this was a trick devised and promoted by the Qing court's running dogs. This kind of children's game already embodies the Qing officials' curse on the revolutionary Mr. Sun Yat-sen and their麻醉anesthesia of children.

　　Just the opposite of this game, in the late Qing Dynasty, a three-finger game was popular in Guangdong and other places. One finger represents the people, one finger represents the officials, and one finger represents the imperialist 洋鬼子foreign devils. The rule of the game is: foreign devils are afraid of the people, the people are afraid of the officials, and the officials are afraid of the foreign devils. Each finger has an object to win or lose against, and the fingers determine the outcome. This simple game tells people about the corruption of the Qing court, inspires the confidence of the masses, and at the same time exposes the essence of the collusion between officials and imperialists. Such a game was by no means spontaneously carried out by children. It is very likely that it was advocated by anti-Qing patriots. This game embodies the patriots' understanding of the historical situation at that time and their efforts to awaken the masses.

　　There are many, many things like this that can be cited.

　　Shi Nai'an, who wrote "Water Margin," and Luo Guanzhong, who wrote "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," because their books exposed the hideous faces of the upper-class figures in feudal society who were treacherous and vicious,憧憬yearning for humanitarian politics or praising heroes who gathered to revolt, they gained the admiration of the masses. However, feudal scholar-officials厌恶detested them. Therefore, in the upper class, there was the admonition: "Don't read Water Margin when young, don't read Romance of the Three Kingdoms when old." The "upper" figures also created such rumors, saying that because Luo Guanzhong wrote "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," three generations of his descendants were哑mute.

　　Just the opposite of such things, some figures representing feudal forces were revered by feudal emperors as idols of virtuous men, but they were嘲弄ridiculed and scorned by the masses. The monk Fahai in "The Legend of the White Snake" is a symbol of feudal authority, and he is still the winner in the legend. However, the people in Zhejiang Province specifically call the团mass of roughly humanoid internal organs in the crab shells in the stream "Monk Fahai," expressing their hatred for this monk. Boyi and Shuqi, who starved to death on Shouyang Mountain rather than eat Zhou millet, were regarded as virtuous men by the upper class of feudal society, but many masses did not approve of their actions. Many overseas Chinese who went to Malaya called a kind of local orangutan "Boyi Shuqi." This is truly a big joke on traditional thought.

　　Some legends and oral praise and criticism like these may not be written in books, but they sharply embody the ideological struggle of various class figures.

　　In China, the same folk tale often has two different versions. The story of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl is an example. The version that says the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl were unreasonably punished by the Emperor of Heaven because they were in love expresses the sympathy of the masses for the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl's misfortune. The version that says the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl were condemned by the Emperor of Heaven for being lazy after falling in love represents the scholar-officials' praise of the patriarchal system. In this case, the two sides engaged in ideological struggle are sometimes completely invisible.

　　Someone wrote "Water Margin" to expose the corruption of the court, and someone then wrote "Pacifying the Bandits" to curse the rebels for eventually perishing. Someone wrote "Dream of the Red Chamber" to accuse the crimes of feudal society, and someone then wrote things like "Dream of the Red Chamber Fulfilled" to praise a social order where "everything is arranged well." On the surface, the later generations are still writing sequels to the predecessors, which seems quite friendly; in reality, this is a trick to replace the sky and change the earth.

　　There are many such things in history, and even more such things in reality.

　　When people who 服膺uphold socialism are working hard to promote scientific things and collectivism, the international bourgeoisie is desperately promoting subjective things and individualism. Their propaganda materials do not necessarily all talk about anti-communism and anti-democracy. On the contrary, some are very "detached," specializing in publishing photos of thighs, specializing in talking about eating, drinking, and having fun,鼓吹promoting individual struggle,宣传propagating individual freedom that does not need to be responsible to the collective... Copies of such publications constitute their propaganda network. Because they are very clear: all individualistic things are conducive to the rule of the bourgeoisie.

　　The largest consulate in the world, the US Consulate in Hong Kong, is investing heavily in publishing this kind of thing, and also investing in film studios to shoot films that specifically promote "gangster loyalty" (putting the loyalty of small groups above all the interests of the people!). These things, and the patterns in the Hungarian incident where "counter-revolutionaries were very careful not to put forward their own slogans, but secretly did so behind slogans that did not oppose socialism but seemed revolutionary," and "hiding behind some different slogans that could still affect all strata of the people," can make us deeply appreciate the complexity of all struggles, including ideological struggles.

　　This situation makes people think: an ignorant person can easily become a tool of ambitious people, and a political庸人mediocre person can堕落degenerate into the cat's paw of the enemy. I heard that some places again feel that "politics is always the same." Is it really that simple? When people are alive, there is no time to stop eating, and vigilance and political ideological水平level have no graduation time. On the ideological front, sometimes the situation is so complex that it requires us to be so calm to distinguish everything, and at the same time, it requires us to use our hard-won and precious democratic rights so seriously! Needless to say, it also requires us to英勇fight so actively for socialist ideology!

    思想战场备忘录
    秦牧
    战场上，除了阵地战之外，还有游击战，坑道战、斥堠战种种形式的战争。在思想的战场里，我想也没有例外。
    在历史上，在生活里面，有许多表面上看似无关重要的事情，实际上都体现了各种阶级思想的激烈斗争。
    最近看到人们在纪叙一些辛亥革命以前的事情，提到清末有些省份的乡间，村童们流行着“捉孙文，捉黄兴”的游戏。一两个人扮中山先生和黄兴，其他的孩子就纷纷来捉。我想，那时候偏僻地方的村童，根本不会懂得中山先生是谁，一般的乡民也不会想出这样的游戏。不用说，这是清廷走狗们想出来并且加以推广的花样。这样一种儿童游戏，已经体现了清廷官吏对于革命者中山先生的咒骂和对于儿童的麻醉了。
    和这种游戏刚刚相反，清末广东等地流行一种三个指头的游戏。一个指头代表百姓，一个指头代表官，一个指头代表帝国主义洋鬼子。游戏的规则是：洋鬼子怕百姓，百姓怕官，官怕洋鬼子。各个手指都有输赢的对象，出指互定胜负。这个简单的游戏，告诉人们清廷的腐败，启发群众的自信心，同时揭露了官吏和帝国主义者勾结的本质，含义是很深远的。这样的游戏也决不是什么儿童们自发进行的。很大的可能是反清志士们所倡导的。在这个游戏中体现的是当年志士们对于历史形势的认识，和对于唤醒群众的努力。
    像这一类的事情，是可以举出很多很多的。
    写“水浒”的施耐庵，写“三国演义”的罗贯中，由于他们的书揭发了封建社会上层人物你诈我虞，穷凶极恶的嘴脸，憧憬着人道主义的政治或者歌颂了聚众起义的英雄。他们获得了群众的景仰。然而封建士大夫们却厌恶他们，因此，在上层社会中就有“少不看水浒，老不看三国”的训诫。“上层”人物还造了这样的谣言，说罗贯中因为写了“三国演义”，子孙三代都哑了。
    和这样的事情刚刚相反，有些代表封建势力的人物，被封建帝王尊为贤人的偶像，却被群众作为嘲弄轻蔑的对象。“白蛇传”中的法海和尚，是封建威权的象征，在传说中还是胜利者。然而浙江一带的人民偏偏把溪水蟹壳里那一团略具人形的脏腑叫做“法海和尚”，表示对这个和尚的憎恶。不食周粟饿死首阳山的伯夷叔齐，被封建社会上层人物当做贤人，然而许多群众却对于他们的行径不以为然，有许多华侨到马来亚去，把当地出产的一种猩猩称呼做“伯夷叔齐”。这真是对于传统思想开了一个大大的玩笑。
    像这样一些传说，一些口头的毁誉，不一定笔之于书，然而它们却尖锐地体现了各种阶级人物思想的斗争。
    在中国，同样一个民间故事，却常常流传着两种不同的讲法，像牛郎织女的故事就是一个例子。那种说牛郎织女因为相恋受到天帝的无理惩罚的讲法，表达了群众对于牛郎织女遭遇的同情。那种说牛郎织女相恋后因懒惰受到天帝谴责的说法，却代表了士大夫们对于家长制的讴歌。在这种场合，进行思想斗争的双方有时甚至是完全不露面的。
    有人写了“水浒”来揭露朝廷的腐败，就有人接着写“荡寇志”来咒骂起义者终归灭亡。有人写了“红楼梦”来控诉封建社会的罪恶，就有人接着写“红楼圆梦”之类的东西来歌颂“一切都安排得不错”的社会秩序。表面上看来，后人还是给前人写续集，怪好感似的；实际上，这正是一场偷天换日的丑把戏。
    历史上多的是这样的事情，现实里更多的是这样的事情。
    当服膺社会主义的人们努力宣传科学的东西，宣传集体主义的时候，国际资产阶级却拚命在宣传主观的东西和个人主义。他们的宣传品不一定全部大谈反共反民主。相反的，有的还“超然”得很，专门登大腿照片的，专门谈吃喝玩乐的，鼓吹个人奋斗的，宣传不必对集体负责任的个人自由的……，一份份这样的出版物构成了他们的宣传网。因为他们很清楚：一切个人主义的东西都是有利于资产阶级的统治的。
    全世界最大的领事馆，美国在香港的领事馆正在大量投资出版这一类的东西，同时也投资到制片场里拍摄一些专门宣传“江湖义气”（把小集团的义气放在一切人民利益之上！）的影片。这些事情和匈牙利事件中，“反革命分子十分小心地不提出自己的口号，但是却在不反对社会主义、相反却像是革命的口号后面偷偷地干。”和“躲在仍然可能影响人民各个阶层的一些不同的口号后面”等花样，都可以使我们深深地体会到各种斗争，包括思想斗争在内的错综复杂性。
    这种情形使人想到：一个无知的人有时很容易变成野心家的工具，一个政治上的庸人有时尽可以堕落成为敌人的猫脚爪。听说有些地方又有人觉得“政治学来学去都是那一套”了。难道真是这样简单吗？人活着，吃饭没有停止的时候，警惕性和政治思想水平也没有满师的时候。在思想战线上，有时形势是这样的复杂，它需要我们多么冷静地来辨别一切，同时又需要我们多么严肃地来运用我们得之不易的宝贵的民主权利！不用说，更需要我们英勇地为社会主义思想进行多么积极的斗争！
