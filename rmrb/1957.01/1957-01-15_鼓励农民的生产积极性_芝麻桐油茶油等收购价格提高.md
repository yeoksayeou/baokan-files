Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The State Council recently issued instructions to various localities, deciding to increase the purchase price of sesame nationwide.

The instructions stated that in recent years, China's sesame production has not fully met the needs of the people, and in some areas, production has shown a downward trend. In order to stabilize sesame production and meet the needs of the people, the State Council has decided to appropriately increase the purchase price of sesame. The instructions emphasized that in order to increase sesame production, production measures must also be taken. All sesame-producing areas must actively experiment with, cultivate, and promote improved sesame varieties, and strive to increase the yield per unit area of sesame in all aspects.

Xinhua News Agency: The State Council issued instructions to various localities on January 8, deciding to increase the purchase prices of tung oil, camellia oil, wood oil, and tallow tree oil. The State Council's instructions mentioned that the current production of tung oil, camellia oil, wood oil, and tallow tree oil in China is not yet sufficient to fully meet the needs of the state and the people. The ratio of purchase prices of these oils to grain purchase prices is also lower than the levels before the War of Resistance Against Japan and in the early days of liberation. Many places have reported that farmers' interest in planting or cultivating tung trees, camellia trees, and tallow trees is not high. In order to appropriately develop the production of these perennial oils and stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for production, it has been decided to increase the purchase prices of these oils nationwide.

    鼓励农民的生产积极性
    芝麻桐油茶油等收购价格提高
    新华社14日讯　国务院最近向各地发出指示，决定在全国范围内提高芝麻的收购价格。
    指示说，近几年来，我国芝麻的生产，不能完全适应人民的需要，某些地区的产量有下降的趋势，为了稳定芝麻的生产，适应人民的需要，国务院决定适当调高芝麻的收购价格。指示中强调为了提高芝麻的产量，还必须从生产上采取措施。各个芝麻产区，必须积极试验，培育和推广芝麻的优良品种，从各方面努力提高芝麻的单位面积产量。
    新华社讯　国务院于1月8日向各地发出指示，决定提高桐油、茶油、木油、桕油的收购价格。国务院的指示中提到，目前我国桐油、茶油、木油、桕油的产量还不能充分满足国家和人民的需要。这些油品的收购价格同粮食收购价格的比价，也低于抗日战争以前和解放初期的水平。不少地方反映，农民种植或者培育桐树、茶树、桕树的兴趣不高。为了适当发展这些多年生的油品生产，刺激农民生产的积极性，决定在全国范围内提高这些油品的收购价格。
