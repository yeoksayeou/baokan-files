Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, January 24th: Zhejiang Province, a famous silkworm cocoon and tea producing area in China, had a total silkworm cocoon output of 550,000 dan and a total tea output of 442,000 dan in 1956, both reaching the highest levels since liberation. The famous "Longjing" and "Yuehong" teas not only increased in output, but also significantly improved in quality compared to the past.

1956 was the first year for Zhejiang Province to realize agricultural cooperation. Because agricultural cooperatives had unified arrangements and use of land, labor, and capital, they overcame many insurmountable difficulties that individual economies had in developing sericulture and tea, such as lack of capital and technology. Agricultural cooperatives in various places universally strengthened the replanting of missing seedlings and the cultivation and management of mulberry and tea gardens. The application of natural fertilizer alone generally increased by 50% to 100% compared to the previous year. The full utilization of mulberry leaves by agricultural cooperatives in various places increased the number of summer and autumn silkworms raised by about 30% compared to 1955, and also raised 40,000 sheets of late autumn silkworm species, which were rarely raised in the history of the province. Agricultural cooperatives in various places also generally increased the number of tea picking times and expanded the picking area of summer and autumn tea. On the basis of cooperation, the effective "fast silkworm raising method" and advanced tea picking methods have been promoted. In addition, agricultural cooperatives in various places opened up more than 80,000 mu of new mulberry gardens, and restored barren tea gardens and developed new tea gardens by 200,000 mu in 1956.

    浙江去年蚕茧和茶叶产量
    达到解放以来的最高水平
    新华社杭州24日电　我国蚕茧和茶叶的著名产地浙江省，1956年蚕茧总产量为五十五万担，茶叶总产量为四十四万二千担，都达到了解放以来的最高水平。驰名中外的“龙井”、“越红”等茶叶，不仅产量增加了，而且品质也比已往有显著提高。
    1956年是浙江省实现农业合作化的头一年。由于农业社土地、劳力和资金都得到统一安排和使用，克服了过去个体经济在发展蚕桑、茶叶上缺乏资金、技术不高等许多不能克服的困难。各地农业社普遍加强了对桑园、茶园缺株补植和培育管理的工作。单是施用自然肥料，一般比前年增加50％到一倍。各地农业社对桑叶的充分利用，使全省夏蚕、秋蚕比1955年增养了30％左右，并且饲养了这个省历史上很少饲养的晚秋蚕种四万张。各地农业社对茶叶也较普遍地增加了采摘次数和扩大了夏茶、秋茶的采摘面积。在合作化的基础上，富有成效的“快速养蚕法”和先进的采茶方法都得到了推广。此外，各地农业社在1956年共开辟新桑园八万多亩，恢复荒芜茶园和发展新茶园二十万亩。
