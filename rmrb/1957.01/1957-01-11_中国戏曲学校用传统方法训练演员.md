Xinhua News Agency, January 9th: People often applaud the fighting scenes in Peking Opera. These actors, whose skills move the audience, are all trained using traditional methods.

Recently, fifty or sixty students from the Chinese Opera School gave a performance for some of the personnel participating in the National Professional Performing Arts Festival. The students performed their daily practice routines, including "Zhanzi Gong" (martial arts), basic skills, weapon routines, and body movements.

After the performance, Tamara Klegitievna Leshevich, a Soviet expert from the Beijing Dance School, met with the students backstage. She warmly praised the traditional performing skills and expressed her appreciation for the Chinese Opera School's practice of using traditional teaching methods.

In recent years, many dance troupes have adopted traditional methods to train classical dance actors.

    据新华社9日讯　人们常常为京剧开打的场面喝采。这些有着让观众为之动容的技巧的演员，都是以传统方法训练出来的。
    最近，中国戏曲学校五、六十个学生为参加全国专业团体音乐舞蹈会演的部分人员作了一次表演。学生们表演了他们日常练习的毡子功（武功）、基本功、把子和身段。
    表演结束之后，北京舞蹈学校苏联专家塔玛拉·克列纪季耶符娜·列谢维奇到后台同学生们见面，她热烈地赞美传统表演技巧，而且对中国戏曲学校采用传统方法教学的作法表示赞扬。
