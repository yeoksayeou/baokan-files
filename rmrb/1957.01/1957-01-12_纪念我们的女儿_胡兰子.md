    In Memory of Our Daughter – Hu Lanzi
    Liu Jingqian, Hu Wenxiu

    Our daughter Hu Lanzi has been dead for ten years.

    When Hu Lanzi was alive, there was chaos due to war, social instability, and the country was often bullied by imperialists, and the common people were often oppressed by reactionaries, making life extremely difficult. But Hu Lanzi had an ideal: to live a happy life, to have equality, freedom, and liberation for everyone, and to transform all of China into a beautiful socialist society like the Soviet Union. To realize this ideal, she participated in revolutionary work and joined the Communist Party, but she did not live to see the victory of the revolution, the New China, or the socialist society. Hu Lanzi, rest in peace! Your ideal has been realized by your comrades.

    When Hu Lanzi was alive, the family's life was difficult and life was hard. She was considerate to the elders, cared for her younger siblings, and often helped the villagers. She rushed to do things at home; she always gave the best food to others; she actively ran to help when villagers were in trouble. She had a plan to make the elders live happily, to help her younger siblings grow up, and to make everyone live a good life, but she did not live to see the victory of the revolution, our agricultural cooperatives, or our good days. Hu Lanzi, rest in peace! We and the villagers are doing well, and my younger siblings have also grown up. They are studying at school, preparing to learn skills to inherit your revolutionary cause and participate in socialist construction.

    Hu Lanzi died, killed by the enemy. The enemy tied her up, threatened her, and interrogated her, but she did not reveal any revolutionary secrets, nor did she implicate a single revolutionary comrade. She only told the enemy that she didn't know, that she knew nothing. At the time of her death, her eyes were still staring at the enemy, as if to say, "Kill me, you can't kill all the revolutionaries. If you kill me, millions of people will avenge me." But she died, killed by the enemy. She did not live to see the victory of the revolution, the liberation of Wenshui City, or the execution of "Big Beard." Hu Lanzi, rest in peace! The enemy has long been wiped out by the People's Liberation Army, and the government has avenged you.

    Hu Lanzi died. She grew up before our eyes and was raised by our own hands. She is gone forever, she has left us forever, but we are not sad. We often receive letters from all over the country, and people often come to visit us. Some people even call us "Dad, Mom." They are all good people, all good children like Hu Lanzi. When we read their enthusiastic letters and see their lovely faces, we are as happy as if we had seen Hu Lanzi. We lost a relative, but we gained tens of thousands of relatives. Hu Lanzi, rest in peace! Our life is not lonely, we have received a lot of comfort, you don't have to worry.

    Hu Lanzi died, sacrificed for the revolution. She is our own flesh and blood, and also a good child of all the Chinese people. She died staunchly, strongly, and bravely. We are proud to have given birth to such a daughter, and all the Chinese people are proud to have such a child.

    Hu Lanzi, our good daughter, rest in peace!

    纪念我们的女儿——胡兰子
    刘景谦　胡文秀
    我们的女儿胡兰子死去十年了。
    胡兰子活着的时候，兵慌马乱，社会不安定，国家常常受帝国主义欺侮，老百姓常常受反动派压迫，真是难活极了。但是胡兰子有一个理想，就是要过幸福日子，叫大家平等、自由、解放，叫全中国变成苏联那样美好的社会主义社会。她为实现这个理想，参加了革命工作，参加了共产党，可是她没有活到革命胜利，没有看见新中国，没有看见社会主义社会。胡兰子，你安息吧！你的理想已经由你的同志们实现了。
    胡兰子活着的时候，家里日子难过，生活很苦，她很体贴老人，爱护弟妹，还常常帮助乡亲们。家里有了事，她抢着做；有了吃的，她尽让别人；乡亲们有了难处，她也积极跑去帮忙。她有一个打算，就是叫老人们生活痛快，叫弟妹们长大成人，叫大家都过好日子，可是她没有活到革命胜利，没有看见我们的农业社，没有看见我们的好日月。胡兰子，你安息吧！我们和乡亲们都好过了，弟弟妹妹们也长大了，他们正在学校念书，准备学下本领，继承你的革命事业，去参加社会主义建设。
    胡兰子死了，她是叫敌人杀死的，敌人捆她、吓唬她、逼问她，她没暴露一点革命秘密，没连累一个革命同志，她只告诉敌人不知道，什么也不知道。临死的时候，她的两眼还瞪住敌人，好像是说，“你杀吧，革命的人是杀不尽的，你们杀了我，会有千百万人来替我报仇。”可是她死了，叫敌人杀死了，她没有活到革命胜利，没有看见解放文水城，没有看见枪毙“大胡子”。胡兰子，你安息吧！敌人早被解放军消灭了，政府已经替你报了仇。
    胡兰子死了，她是在我们眼底下长大的，是我们亲手抚养成人的。她永远不在了，她永远离开我们了，可是我们并不难过，我们经常接到全国各地的来信，经常有人来看望我们，还有人称呼我们：“爸爸、妈妈”，他们都是些好人，都是像胡兰子一样的好孩子。我们读到他们那些热情的信，看到他们那副可爱的样子，就像是见了胡兰子一样高兴。我们失去了一个亲人，却得到了成千上万的亲人。胡兰子，你安息吧！我们的生活并不孤单，我们得到了很多人的安慰，你不用挂念。
    胡兰子死了，为革命牺牲了，她是我们的亲骨肉，也是全中国人民的好孩子。她死的坚贞、刚强、勇敢，我们为生养这样的女儿自豪，全中国人民都为有这样的孩子自豪。
    胡兰子，我们的好女儿，你安息吧！
