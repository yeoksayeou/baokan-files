Trip to Honghe
By our reporter Chen Yongjin

In the depth of winter, I came to Hekou County on the edge of Yunnan's Honghe River. The scenery here captivated me.

At night, the insects chirp like a tide. Such sounds remind one of autumn. Is this not autumn? Many people have put on their jackets, the rice in the fields is yellow, and the heavy ears are drooping. Members of the agricultural cooperative are busy harvesting the grain. But it doesn't seem like autumn: whether at night or during the day, the diligent cuckoos fly and call frequently, which easily reminds northerners that their wheat is ripe. The swallows have flown back from the distant north and are already nesting.

How much I want to understand our beautiful and peaceful country! Comrades from the county committee led us from the south of Hekou. The small white houses on the opposite bank, the place where the train whistles sound, is Lao Cai, the territory of our neighboring country Vietnam. Here, the people of Hekou can share Vietnamese radio music, and the people of Lao Cai can also share our radio music. Swallows fly back and forth like shuttles, sometimes flying down to gently pat the waters of the Honghe and Naxi rivers with their wings.

We walked north along the Honghe River, and bamboo rafts floated down the river one by one, stopping on a large stretch of wide river beach. People on the river beach are cutting bamboo tiles. A bamboo can be cut into twenty bamboo tiles. Using such bamboo tiles to build houses, the sun cannot penetrate, and the rain does not leak. Such large areas of sun-dried bamboo tiles are laid out on the river beach. These people who cut bamboo tiles say that five cents for a large bamboo is too cheap. It is indeed too cheap. When you see that people here generally use bamboo for cooking, you feel that cutting bamboo tiles for building houses is much better than burning it as firewood. If the train from Bisezhai to Hekou is opened, how great it would be to transport these large bamboos that are burned as firewood to the inland! If not, establishing a paper mill in this place with plenty of water, bamboo, and trees would change the situation of paper shortage in Yunnan. Now, Yunnan's paper, even straw paper, has to be transported from other places.

In this subtropical region, every grass and tree that unfolds before my eyes is fresh and moving. I remember asking about the enticingly fragrant Michelia figo flowers at the Longfusi Flower Market in Beijing. A Michelia figo flower as thick as a small teacup costs sixty yuan, and a smaller pot costs thirty yuan. But the Michelia figo flowers on the small hill behind the Hekou County Committee are as tall and thick as poplars in the north. At the Hekou County People's Committee, on the Bihe Highway, and on the edge of the Honghe River, I saw many such Michelia figo trees. When our jeep sped towards Hekou City, and when we arrived at the Binlang Township Agricultural Cooperative, my companions said to me: How fragrant these osmanthus flowers are! They truly deserve the saying "the fragrance of osmanthus flowers travels ten miles"! The osmanthus flowers here are not planted in flower pots, but grow together with the dense broad-leaved bamboos. Their trunks are as tall as poplars in the north. Their petals are not as small as grains of rice like ordinary osmanthus flowers, but as large as beans, and they grow in bunches on the branches. It is said that the fragrance of osmanthus flowers can be smelled here all year round. What a desirable place this is!

From the foot of the mountain covered with broad-leaved bamboo to the hilltops, there are longan trees. Speaking of the delicious longan, it is such a rarity in the north! Not to mention in the north, even in Kunming, it costs more than two yuan per catty. Both sides of Beida Street in Hekou City are lined with longan trees, and the dense longan leaves cover the street. The people of Hekou told me that even the small longan trees on the street bear 200 catties a year. How can the longan trees on the hills that can be embraced bear only a few hundred catties a year! It is also suitable for planting lychees here. In the Nujiang area of Yunnan, lychees picked from the trees cost more than one yuan per catty. How great it would be to develop these nationally rare fruit trees here!

We walked northwest along Hekou Avenue, which is planted with beautiful phoenix trees. Not only are there towering camphor trees, but also cassava trees more than ten feet tall. The locals call this tree cassava. The stalks are as thick as small teacups, and blocks of cassava grow long and thick. Locals say that one tree can bear ten catties a year. This kind of cassava is everywhere. The taste of cassava is very sweet. This kind of cassava and wild banana stalks are both good feed for pigs. Pig feed in this frost-free evergreen zone can be said to be everywhere. But this sparsely populated area also lacks pork. A comrade in the county said: The development of pig farming lacks feed. Here, one is also reminded that with so many camphor trees, why are the camphor blocks sold in Kunming transported from Guangzhou? Why is a camphor block that weighs less than one or two so expensive at five jiao a piece?

Along the clear stream, we came to another beautiful and exciting place. The rows of hills suddenly changed their appearance: it was no longer a place with dense bamboo forests, but orderly rubber plantations. The rows of rubber trees did not move in the hot "winter". Comrades from the Tropical Crops Bureau said: This is the best place in the country to grow rubber. It does not have the disadvantages of a continental climate, nor does it have the disadvantages of a marine climate. There is no frost here all year round, and there is no typhoon intrusion like on Hainan Island. The young people at the Tropical Crops Experimental Farm are very excited when they calculate one account after another. They are calculating how much land has already been surveyed in Hekou County that can be planted with rubber, and how many mu it is estimated that it can be expanded to in the future. When we walked along the Naxi River, the young lads in the rubber plantations were clearing the mountains. They were going to turn the bamboo and trees on the fertile black soil mountains into rubber. In these rubber forests, before the rubber trees grow into large trees, pepper can also be planted. They wanted me to see their white pepper seedlings. Yang Congjin said: These twenty-eight white pepper plants were sent from Indonesia. If you plant this white pepper, you can plant one hundred and sixty plants per mu. When they grow up, one plant can bear one jin of pepper seeds, and the current market price of one jin is fourteen yuan. According to this calculation, the income per mu per year is more than two thousand yuan. After looking at the white pepper vines that were only two feet long, Yang Congjin touched a seedling that looked like a newly sprouted coconut tree and said: That is oil palm. This oil palm was also given by friends in Indonesia. Oil palm is the plant with the highest oil content. It can bear fruit after five years. One tree can bear more than 250 catties of fruit, and the oil content is 25%. According to the introduction of Indonesian friends, the highest yield of this oil palm is 45 kilograms of oil per tree. This kind of vegetable oil tree can be planted eighteen trees per mu, and one mu is more than 800 kilograms of oil, which is equivalent to six to eight times the amount of peanuts. These young people are carefully cultivating these plants. They specialize in testing subtropical crops, and these seedlings will be promoted to places where they can be promoted in the future.

Leaving Hekou and heading north, a strange road puzzled me. The glittering things on the road in front of me, some are as big as fish scales, and some are as big as palms. Originally they were stone-like, but when cars drive over them and people walk on them, the stone-like things are crushed into pieces. This glittering thing paved on the road is mica, a good raw material for manufacturing insulators. I picked up a piece at random on the road, and it weighed one or two catties. In fact, this kind of mica is almost everywhere in Hekou. The courtyard of the Hekou County Committee and the small hill where we live seem to be paved with mica.

The dark bamboo forests, the clear streams, and the mica-paved roads led us to Binlang Township. Binlang Township has established a multi-ethnic joint cooperative. In this cooperative, there are Nong, Sha, Yao, Dai, Han, and two Vietnamese overseas Chinese families. The Sha people are the richest in this cooperative because they know how to grow rice and plant fruits; the Yao people are relatively poor and only moved down from the mountains in 1955. In March 1955, Binlang Township carried out land reform through peaceful consultation and distributed 82% of the landlords' land to landless and land-poor farmers. In May 1955, fourteen mutual aid teams were established, and in March 1956, agricultural production cooperatives were established. The farmers' production enthusiasm is very high. Originally, double-cropping rice was not planted, but now double-cropping rice is planted; originally, no fertilizer was applied to the land, but now fertilizer is applied. In the past, rice was planted two feet apart from each other, but now more than 900 mu of land have implemented close planting with small seedlings. When we arrived in Binlang Township, the cooperative was harvesting the second crop of rice. As a result of planting double-cropping rice, some land yields more than 1,000 catties a year. In the past, they only planted one crop of rice and did not apply fertilizer, and at most they could only harvest 500 catties a year. Farmers on such fertile land were oppressed and exploited by French imperialism and landlords before liberation, and half of them did not have enough to eat. In 1956, their cooperative sold more than 40,000 catties of surplus grain to the state; and every household raised several cows. The agricultural cooperative members of Binlang Township pointed to the ancient and lush "Dragon Mountain" [Note] behind the village and said: In the past, there was no bumper harvest when worshiping the dragon. Listening to the Communist Party, there is a bumper harvest even without worshiping the dragon. [Note] Local ethnic minorities call the mountain with the most flourishing big trees "Dragon Mountain."

    红河行
    本报记者　陈勇进
    隆冬，我来到云南红河边的河口县。这里的景色把我迷住了。
    夜间，虫儿们潮水般地吵闹着。这样的声音，使人想起了秋天。这难道不是秋天吗？很多人穿上了夹衣，田野的稻子黄了，那沉甸甸的穗儿垂下来，农业合作社的社员们正忙着收割谷子。这好像又不是秋天：不管是夜间和白天，那殷勤的布谷鸟儿，频繁地飞着叫着，这很容易使北方人想起，他们的麦子黄熟了。小燕子从遥远的北方飞回来已经抱窝了。
    我是多么想了解我们美丽和平的国土啊！县委的同志领着我们从河口的南面开始了。对岸那些小白房子，那火车的汽笛鸣叫着的地方，就是老街，那是我们的邻邦越南的国土。在这里，河口的人民可以分享越南的广播音乐，老街的人民同样可以分享我们的广播音乐。小燕子穿梭般地飞来飞去，有时飞下来轻轻地用翅膀拍打红河和南溪河的流水。
    我们沿着红河向北走，那红河上的竹筏一个个顺水流放下来，停在一大片宽阔的河滩上。河滩上的人们正在砍竹瓦。一棵竹子可以砍成二十个竹瓦。用这样的竹瓦盖房子，太阳晒不透，下雨又不漏。河滩上铺着那么大片片晒干的竹瓦。这些砍竹瓦的人们说，五分钱一根大竹子太便宜了。确实太便宜了，当你看到这里的人们普遍地拿着竹子烧锅的时候，你就感到砍竹瓦盖房子总比当木柴烧了强得多。如果碧色寨到河口的火车修通了，把这些当木柴烧的大竹子运到内地该有多好啊！再不然，在这个水多、竹子多、树木多的地方，建立个造纸厂，云南缺纸的情况就会有所改变。现在云南的纸，甚至草纸都要从外地运来。
    在这个亚热带地区，展现在我眼前的一草一木都是新鲜的，动人的。我记得，在北京的隆福寺花市上，我询问过那诱人芳香的缅桂花。一棵像小茶杯样粗的缅桂花要六十元，另外一盆小一点的也要三十元。可是在河口县委所在地的小山包包上的缅桂花，就像北方的白杨树那样高那样粗。在河口县人民委员会，在碧河公路上，在红河边，我看到了很多这样的缅桂树。当我们的吉普车飞驰着向河口市驶去的时候，当我们到槟榔乡农业合作社的时候，同行者对我说：这桂花多香啊！真能称得起“风吹十里桂花香”吧！这里的桂花，没人栽到花盆里，是和那浓密的宽叶竹子长在一块儿的。它的身干，也像北方的白杨那样高。它的花瓣儿也不是像普通桂花那样米粒般小，而是像豆粒般大，枝子上结得一串串的。据说这里一年四季都可以闻到桂花的香味。这是多么令人向往的地方啊！
    从长满宽叶竹的山脚下走到那山岗岗上，那里长满了龙眼树。提起那美味的龙眼来，在北方该是多么稀罕呀！别说在北方，就是在昆明，也是两元多一斤。河口市的北大街，两旁都是龙眼树，那繁密的龙眼叶子遮蔽着大街。河口的人们告诉我：就是那街上不大的龙眼树，一年也要结二百斤。那山岗上合抱的龙眼一年何止几百斤！在这里种植荔枝也同样合适。在云南的怒江一带，从树上摘下的荔枝就要一元多钱一斤。在这里如果发展这些全国稀有的果木该有多么好啊！
    我们穿过那植有优美的凤凰树的河口大街向西北走，这里不仅有参天的樟脑树，还有一丈多高的甘薯树。此地人把这种树称作木薯。杆子粗的像小茶碗，结了一块块的木薯，长得长而粗。当地人说一棵树一年可结十来斤。这种木薯真是遍地皆是。木薯的味道非常甘美。这种木薯和野芭蕉杆子，都是很好的喂猪饲料。喂猪的饲料在这无霜的长青地带，可以说到处皆是。但这地广人稀的地方也同样缺少猪肉。县里的一位同志却说：发展养猪业缺乏饲料。在这里同样使人想到，那么多的樟脑树，为什么昆明出售的樟脑块要从广州运来呢？为什么不到一两重的樟脑块贵到五角钱一块呢？
    沿着那清清的流水，我们到了另一个优美的令人兴奋的地方。那一架架的山岗岗上，突然变了它的模样：那不再是竹林茂密的地方，而是整整齐齐的橡胶园。那一行行的橡胶树在那炎热的“冬天”里动也不动。热带作物局的同志说：这里种植橡胶是全国最好的地方。它没有大陆气候的缺点，也没有海洋气候的缺点，在这里终年无霜，也没有海南岛台风的侵袭。热带作物试验场的那些青年们，左算一笔账，右算一笔账，真是令人兴奋之至。他们计算着在河口县已经勘察了多少可以种植橡胶的土地，将来估计可以扩大到多少亩。我们沿南溪河走的时候，那里橡胶园的那些青年小伙子正在清理山场，他们要把那肥沃的黑土山上的竹子、树木都改成橡胶。在这些橡胶林子里，在橡胶树没有长成大树以前，还可以栽胡椒。他们要我看看他们的白胡椒秧子。杨从金说：这二十八棵白胡椒是从印度尼西亚送来的。如果栽这白胡椒，一亩地可以栽一百六十棵，长大了一棵可以结一市斤胡椒子，一市斤现在市场的价格是十四元。这样算起来，一亩地一年的收入是两千多元。看了白胡椒那才两尺长的蔓蔓以后，杨从金又摸着像刚出苗的椰子树一样的苗子说：那是油棕。这种油棕也是印度尼西亚的朋友给的。油棕是含油量最高的植物，五年以后就可以结果，一棵树可结二百五十多斤果，含油量是25％。根据印度尼西亚朋友的介绍，这种油棕最高产量一棵可产四十五公斤油，这种植物油树一亩地可种十八棵，一亩地就是八百多公斤油。相当于种花生的六倍到八倍。这些青年们正在精心的培育这些植物。他们就是专门试验亚热带作物的，这些苗苗将来都要向可以推广的地方推广。
    出了河口一直向北，一种奇怪的马路使我迷惑了。摆在我眼前的那马路上闪闪发光的东西，有的像鱼鳞一样大，有的像巴掌一样大。原先是石块状，汽车一轧，人一走，把那石块状的东西轧成了片片。这铺在路上发光的东西就是云母，制造绝缘物的很好的原料。我在马路上随手拾起一块来，就有一两斤重。其实，这种云母在河口几乎遍地都是，河口县委会的院子里和我们住的小山岗上，就像是云母铺的一样。
    那黑黝黝的竹林子，那清清的流水，那云母铺成的道路，把我们引到槟榔乡来。槟榔乡已经成立了一个多民族的联合社。在这个社里有侬族、沙族、瑶族、傣族、汉族，还有两户越南侨民。这个社里以沙族最富，因为他们会种田栽水果；瑶族比较苦，是1955年才从山上搬下来的。槟榔乡1955年3月用和平协商的办法进行了土地改革，把82％的地主的土地分给了无地少地的农民。1955年5月间成立了十四个互助组，1956年3月间又成立了农业生产合作社，农民的生产情绪很高。原来不种双季稻，现在种了双季稻；原来种地不施肥现在施肥了。过去，稻子都是离两尺远种一棵，现在有九百多亩地都实行了小株密植。我们到槟榔乡的时候，社里正在收割第二季稻。种双季稻的结果，有的地一亩一年就收一千多斤。过去他们种一季稻又不施肥，最多的一年只能收到五百斤。这样富庶的土地上的农民，解放前受着法帝国主义和地主的压迫剥削，有一半人不够吃。1956年他们社里卖给国家余粮四万多斤；并且家家都养了几头牛。槟榔乡的农业社员指着村后的古老而繁茂的“龙山”〔注〕说：过去祭龙的时候都不丰收，听共产党的话，不祭龙也丰收了。〔注〕当地兄弟民族把长着最旺盛的大树的山叫做“龙山”。（附图片）
