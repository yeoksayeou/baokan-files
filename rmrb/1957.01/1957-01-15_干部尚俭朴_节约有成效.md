    Cadres Advocate Thrift and Simplicity; Economy Achieves Results

    Many responsible cadres walk to work, freeing up a lot of office space and dormitories, and using waste office supplies to save administrative expenses

    (Our newspaper reports) Jilin Provincial People's Committee directly affiliated organs' economy drive has been launched.

    According to the spirit of the Second Plenary Session and the notice of the Provincial People's Committee, on December 25th last year, the Provincial Bureau of Government Offices centralized the management of forty-one cars of the provincial directly affiliated organs and canceled the provision for directors and bureau chiefs to take cars to and from work alone. At present, cadres use large buses at fixed times and locations. Many directors and bureau chiefs who live closer to the office do not even take the bus to and from work. Two provincial governors also do not ride in cars alone but take the bus with everyone else. In addition, the original twenty civil servants in the dormitories of the directors and bureau chiefs were also removed in late December last year. These civil servants have been or will be assigned to appropriate positions.

    Office and dormitory space have also been appropriately adjusted. The forty-one units directly under the province originally occupied twelve buildings, totaling 27,265 square meters. Currently, four buildings totaling 4,571 square meters have been vacated and converted into single and family dormitories or used as office space for newly established institutions. Originally, 104 households of cadres at or above the level of director and bureau chief lived in agency dormitories, occupying a total of 426 rooms. After the adjustment, 143 rooms were vacated.

    In the economy drive of the provincial directly affiliated organs, the Bureau of Government Offices played an exemplary role. The bureau's office space was originally 383 square meters, and now 249 square meters have been vacated. In addition, they also turned in a set of sofas, seven desks, nine chairs, two coat racks, two filing cabinets, and removed three telephones. Currently, all sections use waste paper for office work. In December last year, the entire bureau did not receive office supplies; in January and February of this year, they also plan to use old and waste office supplies.

    干部尚俭朴　节约有成效
    许多负责干部安步当车，腾出不少办公用房和宿舍，利用废旧办公用品节约行政费用
    本报讯　吉林省人民委员会直属机关的节约活动已经展开。
    根据二中全会和省人民委员会的通知精神，去年12月25日，省机关事务管理局即把省直机关的四十一辆小汽车集中管理了起来，取消了厅、局长上下班单独坐汽车的规定。目前，干部上下班时，统一用大汽车按固定时间、地点接送。许多住地距机关较近的厅、局长，上下班时连大汽车也不坐，有两位省长上下班也不单独乘坐小汽车，和大家一块乘大汽车。另外，厅、局长宿舍的原有二十名公务员，也于去年12月下旬撤掉。这些公务员已经或将要被分配到适当的岗位上。
    办公用房和宿舍用房，也做了适当调整。省直属四十一个单位原占有十二幢楼房，共两万七千二百六十五平方公尺，目前已腾出四幢，四千五百七十一平方公尺，分别改为单身和家属宿舍，或作为新设机构的办公用房。厅、局长以上干部原来住机关宿舍的有一百零四户，共占用房子四百二十六间，调整后，腾让出来了一百四十三间。
    在省直机关的节约中，机关事务管理局起了示范作用。局里的办公用房原有三百八十三平方公尺，现腾出了二百四十九平方公尺。另外，还交出沙发一套，办公桌七个，椅子九个，衣架两个，卷柜两个，还撤除了三台电话机。目前，各科都利用废纸办公。去年12月，全局未领办公用品；今年1、2月份，还准备利用旧废办公用品。
