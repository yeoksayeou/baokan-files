Xinhua News Agency: Exploration Good News

New Oil Layers Discovered in Old Oil Fields

Xinhua News Agency: After drilling in the Laojunmiao and Shiyougou oilfields of the Yumen Oil Mine in 1956, the area of the oilfields has expanded, and new oil layers have been discovered beneath the oilfields.

The Laojunmiao and Shiyougou oilfields are two oilfields currently being exploited by the Yumen Oil Mine. The former has been exploited for a longer time and is larger in scale; the latter only began producing oil in the last two years. In 1956, drilling workers drilled a large number of petroleum exploration wells in these two oilfields, thereby increasing the recoverable reserves of crude oil.

In 1956, it was discovered in the Shiyougou oilfield that the Carboniferous and Permian strata contained oil. Two exploration wells drilled in the Permian strata have recently started flowing crude oil. In the Laojunmiao oilfield, oil was discovered in the Cretaceous strata beneath it, and it can flow naturally; one exploration well is gushing more than 11 tons of crude oil per day. Currently, drilling workers are continuing to drill in these new oil-producing strata.

Rich Coal Reserves Near Kailuan

Xinhua News Agency: After more than three years of exploration, the Kaiping coalfield around Tangshan has proven that not only are the coal reserves in the Kailuan Coal Mine area, which is currently being mined, still very rich, allowing the existing mines to extend their exploitation life by sixty years longer than originally estimated, but also several new mining areas have been discovered, such as Lujiato, Wandao Mountain, Fangezhuang, Xujialou, and Bigezhuang. Furthermore, a new coalfield with the same strata as the Kaiping coalfield has been discovered in the Chezhou Mountain area, fifteen kilometers northwest of Tangshan.

The Kaiping coalfield is located in the Bohai Sea lowland plain, with the Jing-Shan Railway running through it. Its northeast and southwest are close to the two major seaports of Qinhuangdao and Tanggu, making water and land transportation very convenient. The discovery of these mining areas is of great significance to the industrial development of the eastern coastal areas and the North China region.

    老油田下发现新油层
    据新华社讯　玉门油矿老君庙油田和石油沟油田经过1956年的钻探以后，油田的面积又有扩大，并且在油田下面发现了新的油层。
    老君庙油田和石油沟油田是玉门油矿正在开采的两个油田，前者开采较久，规模也大；后者是最近两年才开始采油的。钻井工人1956年在这两个油田上钻凿了大批石油探井，因而增加了原油可采储量。
    1956年在石油沟油田发现石炭纪、二叠纪地层中都含有油；在二叠纪地层上钻成的两口探井，最近都流出了原油。在老君庙油田下面发现白垩纪地层有油，而且能自喷；有一口探井日喷原油达十一吨多。目前，钻井工人正在这几个新的产油地层上继续进行钻探。
    开滦附近储煤丰富
    据新华社讯　唐山周围的开平煤田，经过三年多的勘探证明，不但目前正在开采的开滦煤矿矿区的储煤量仍旧非常丰富，可以使现有矿井的开采寿命比原来估计延长六十年，同时还发现了吕家坨、湾道山、范各庄、徐家楼、毕各庄等好几个新矿区，并且在唐山西北十五公里的车轴山地区，发现一个地层和开平煤田相同的新煤田。
    开平煤田位于渤海低平原，京山铁路横穿其中，它的东北和西南部紧靠秦皇岛、塘沽两大海港，水陆交通运输都很方便。这些矿区的发现，对我国东部沿海地区和华北地区的工业发展有重大意义。
