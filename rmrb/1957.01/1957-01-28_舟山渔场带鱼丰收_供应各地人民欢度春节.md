Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, January 26th. The Zhoushan Fishing Ground in Zhejiang Province, experiencing an unprecedentedly abundant harvest of hairtail, is transporting large quantities of fresh and salted hairtail to various regions to supply the people for a joyful Spring Festival. In the two months from the start of the hairtail season on November 26th of last year to today, over 30,000 tons of various types of vessels in the Zhoushan Fishing Ground have transported 1.2 million dan of hairtail to cities such as Shanghai, Ningbo, and Hangzhou. In addition to supplying the local population, the hairtail is being loaded onto trains, automobiles, ships, and other means of transportation for transfer to cities like Beijing, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, as well as more than twenty provinces and autonomous regions, including Heilongjiang, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Qinghai, Sichuan, and Hunan.

    Currently, the hairtail schools have moved south from the Huanao Island area of the Zhoushan Fishing Ground to the Dachen Fishing Ground. Schools of hairtail have also been discovered recently near Beijishan and Nanjishan, south of Dachen Island. Fishermen are continuing to pursue them with wooden sailboats and motorized sailboats.

    To date, the catch of hairtail in the Zhoushan and Dachen Fishing Grounds has reached 1.35 million dan, an increase of two-fold compared to the total output of the hairtail season in the same period last year, and exceeding this year's production plan for the hairtail season. This year's hairtail density and abundance are rare in decades. According to estimates by the Zhejiang Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau, the hairtail season in the Zhoushan Fishing Ground will end around the Beginning of Spring (February 4th), while the Dachen Fishing Ground will continue until the Awakening of Insects (March 6th).

    舟山渔场带鱼丰收
    供应各地人民欢度春节
    新华社杭州26日电　带鱼空前丰收的浙江省舟山渔场，大量新鲜带鱼和咸带鱼正在源源运往各地，供应人民欢度春节。从去年11月26日带鱼汛开始到今天的两个月中，舟山渔场上三万吨各种不同的船只，已经运输带鱼一百二十万担到上海、宁波、杭州等市，除供应当地人民外，还装上火车、汽车、轮船以及其他运输工具，转运北京、天津、广州等市和黑龙江、新疆、云南、青海、四川、湖南等二十多个省、自治区。
    现在带鱼群已经从舟山渔场花鸟岛一带南下到大陈渔场，大陈岛以南的北麂山、南麂山附近也在最近发现了带鱼群。渔民们驾着木帆船和机帆船，正在继续追捕。
    到目前为止，在舟山渔场和大陈渔场捕获的带鱼已经有一百三十五万担，比去年同期带鱼汛全部产量增加了两倍，并且超额完成了今年带鱼汛的生产计划。今年带鱼这样稠密丰多，为数十年来所罕见。据浙江省水产局的估计，舟山渔场带鱼汛将在立春（2月4日）前后结束，大陈渔场须到惊蛰（3月6日）前后才能结束。
