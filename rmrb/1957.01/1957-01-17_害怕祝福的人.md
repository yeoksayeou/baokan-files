    People Who Fear Blessings
    On New Year's Eve, Khrushchev told Bi Entres, a reporter from the French newspaper "l'Humanité," that he was willing to extend his best wishes to the French working people through "l'Humanité." Who knew that this would greatly alarm the right-wingers of the French Socialist Party. The Socialist Party's official newspaper, "Le Populaire" of Paris, immediately exclaimed in an article on January 1st: This is a terrible blessing! This is an absolutely unacceptable blessing!
    In order to make this hysteria seem more humane, the author of this article insisted that history had proven that the Soviet Communist Party fundamentally did not approve of the establishment of friendship between the Soviet people and the French people.
    The author of this article cited a historical fact from the First World War to support his argument. It is said that the Bolsheviks' withdrawal from the war betrayed the French people, while Pétain's "suppression" of the "rebellion" of French soldiers against the war saved Russia. However, the great French socialist Jaurès said before the outbreak of the war: "We, we socialists, must continue the struggle against war." Because Jaurès opposed this imperialist war, the enemies of the French workers at the time took his life. As for what kind of person Pétain was, history has already drawn its conclusions. The author of this article left Jaurès, who opposed the imperialist war, behind and praised Pétain, who suppressed the anti-war struggle. One cannot help but ask, do the French socialists, who claim to inherit Jaurès' tradition, actually inherit Pétain's tradition?
    The author of this article also cited historical facts from the Second World War. It is said that the Soviet Communist Party had no intention of destroying Nazism, and the Soviet Union did not participate in the Second World War out of love for the freedom of the people of European countries. However, who was it that destroyed the Popular Front that defended the freedom of the French people? Weren't there many right-wingers of the Socialist Party who followed Pétain and succumbed to Hitler? The Socialist writing this article naturally dared not mention this. The current French Foreign Minister Pineau is by no means a pro-communist figure, but during his visit to the Soviet Union last year, he had to admit: "Every Frenchman, regardless of his political beliefs, recalls with gratitude the heroic and bloody struggle that you (the Soviet people) waged for the liberation of all peoples." Now the Socialist Party's official newspaper wants to reverse the case, but unfortunately, arguing with historical truth will not bring glory.
    Why are the right-wingers of the French Socialist Party so hostile to the Soviet Union that they are even afraid of hearing Khrushchev's blessings to the French working people? This article has also revealed the real reason. It turns out that the Soviet Union issued a warning to Britain and France when they invaded Egypt, forcing them to stop their military operations. The author complained that this was a threat to French workers. However, even many prominent figures within the French Socialist Party admitted that the Socialist government's launching of the war of aggression against Egypt was a "disastrous policy" that violated the interests of the French working people. Then, wasn't the Soviet Union's warning to France to stop military action against Egypt completely in line with the interests of the French workers?
    Let the right-wingers of the French Socialist Party be afraid of blessings from the Soviet Union! The friendship between the French people and the Soviet people will definitely continue to develop.

### 害怕祝福的人

    害怕祝福的人
    赫鲁晓夫在新年前夕对法国“人道报”记者比·恩特热斯说，他愿意通过“人道报”向法国劳动人民致以最好的祝福。谁知道，这一下竟使得法国社会党右翼人士大为惊慌。社会党的机关报巴黎“人民报”在1月1日的一篇文章里马上大叫道：这是可怕的祝福！这是绝对不能接受的祝福！
    为了使自己这种歇斯底里显得合乎人情些，这篇文章的作者一口咬定说，历史已经证明了苏联共产党根本不赞成苏联人民和法国人民建立友谊的。
    这篇文章的作者为自己的论点举出了一件第一次世界大战时期的历史事实。据说，当时布尔什维克退出战争是背弃了法国人民，而贝当“扑灭”了反对战争的法国士兵的“叛乱”却挽救了俄国。但是，法国伟大的社会主义者若来士在战争爆发之前就说道：“我们，我们社会党人，一定要继续反战的斗争”。由于若来士反对这个帝国主义战争，当时法国劳动者的敌人就夺去了他的生命。至于贝当是怎样的一个人物呢？历史已经作出了结论。这篇文章的作者把反对帝国主义战争的若来士丢在脑后，而对镇压反战斗争的贝当赞扬备至，人们不禁要问，在口头上以继承若来士传统自居的法国社会党人，难道原来是继承贝当的传统吗？
    这篇文章的作者又举出了第二次世界大战时期的历史事实。据说，苏联共产党是根本不打算摧毁纳粹主义的，苏联并不是由于爱护欧洲各国人民的自由而参加了第二次世界大战。但是，当时是谁破坏了保卫法国人民自由的人民阵线呢？追随着贝当向希特勒屈膝的难道不是有很多社会党右翼的人士吗？这位写文章的社会党人自然不敢提到这一点。现任法国外交部长的比诺决不是什么亲共人物，而他在去年访问苏联时不得不承认说：“每一个法国人，不管他的政治信念怎样，无不怀着感激的心情来回忆你们（苏联人民）为了各国人民的解放所进行的英勇的流血斗争。”现在社会党的机关报想做反案文章了，可惜，要同历史的真实来闹别扭是不能使人增光的。
    为什么法国社会党的右翼人士竟然这样仇视苏联，以致于听到赫鲁晓夫对法国劳动人民的祝福都感到害怕呢？这篇文章也已经透露了真实的原因。原来，苏联在英法侵略埃及的时候向它们提出了警告，使得它们不得不停止了军事行动。作者埋怨说，这是对法国劳动者的威胁。但是，连法国社会党党内许多著名人士也都承认，社会党政府发动侵埃战争是违背法国劳动人民的利益的“灾难性的政策”。那末，苏联警告法国对埃及停止军事行动，难道不正是完全符合法国劳动者利益的吗？
    让法国社会党右翼人士去害怕来自苏联的祝福吧！法国人民和苏联人民的友谊是一定会越来越发展的。　（铎）
