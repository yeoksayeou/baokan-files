Xinhua News Agency, 20th. Gansu, Anhui, Fujian, Henan and other provinces have recently held folk song, dance and opera performances.

The Gansu Province Folk Music and Dance Performance implemented the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom. Folk artists of Han, Hui, Tibetan, Mongolian, Tu, Dongxiang, Salar, and Baoan nationalities, as well as actors from professional song and dance troupes, participating in the performance, presented more than one hundred excellent national and folk art programs. The Tibetan opera "Zhejin Gengdeng" performed by the delegation of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and the "Gaoshan Opera" performed by the old artists of the Wudu Special District are programs with rich national characteristics that have been circulating in the folk for a long time. The Wudu "Gaoshan Opera" had been lost for many years and was only recently unearthed. Many famous folk songs of the Hui, Dongxiang, and Salar nationalities were also performed at the meeting.

At the first folk music and dance performance in Anhui Province, many folk artists and farmers used Xiao, flute, Guqin, etc., to play popular southern music programs and other dances loved by the people. The famous musician Shi Lemeng gave an art report to the actors during the performance.

Fujian Province recently held folk art performances in more than 30 counties and cities. The traditional repertoire that had not been performed for many years—the "Fan Dance" from the Sipin Opera "Romance of the West Chamber"—was also performed this time. The ethnic dance "Wedding Dance" popular among the local She ethnic group was also arranged and performed.

The first opera performance and observation conference held in Henan Province lasted for twenty-eight days. The Yu Opera "Little Erjie's Dream" and "Sima Mao's Complaint," which had been suspended for many years, were awarded at this performance. Some programs reflecting modern life and struggles, such as the Henan ballad opera "Catching Up with Feet," the Yu Opera "Liu Hulan," and the Flower Drum Opera "False Good News," were also rewarded by the conference. Chang Xiangyu and Chen Suzhen, famous Yu Opera actors who have made great contributions to the opera art in Henan Province, and Zhu Wanming and Zhu Liulai, old artists of Henan ballad opera, won the honorary awards presented by the conference.

At the folk music and dance performance conference held in Tangshan Special District, Hebei Province, many old artists in their sixties and seventies personally performed on stage, which was welcomed by the masses. Tangshan Special District has rich folk art. It is the birthplace of Pingju Opera and donkey shadow puppetry. The "Running Donkey" of Changli County participated in the folk art performance held by the central government in 1953 and won praise from the audience. Also, the "Dry Boat" and "Romance of the West Chamber" of Yutian County, the "Flying Cymbal" of Fengrun County, and the "Taiping Drum" of Funing County are all excellent programs of folk art.

This newspaper reports that the Henan Branch of the Chinese Dramatists Association held its inaugural meeting in Zhengzhou on the 14th. Tian Han, chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, Ji Wenfu, deputy governor of Henan Province, and 400 members attended the meeting. At the meeting, one chairman, several vice-chairmen, and fifty-nine directors were elected.
