Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 8th January. Syrian President Kuwatly, who is currently visiting Pakistan, said on the afternoon of January 8th: "Syria and the Arab countries are determined to reject interference and control, no matter where it may come from."

He said at a welcome rally held for him by the citizens of Karachi: "We have paid a very high price for our independence. That is why we should safeguard our independence and not tolerate interference and control from anywhere."

Kuwatly said: "If we tolerate interference, independence becomes an empty phrase. Independence is the freedom to consider what actions to take and to resist interference from anywhere. Precisely because of this, we refuse to become military or other bases."

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 8th January. Pakistani President Mirza hosted a banquet on January 7th in honor of Syrian President Kuwatly, who is visiting Pakistan.

In his speech at the banquet, Mirza said that Pakistan has consistently pursued a policy of friendship with Arab countries since its establishment.

He said: "We believe that our aims should be consistent, which is to oppose injustice and uphold justice."

Xinhua News Agency, 9th January. Rome dispatch: According to the Italian "Avanti!" newspaper, Syrian President Kuwatly, in a conversation with the newspaper's reporter Ubodi, refuted the news of Syria's so-called "Sovietization." He said that this was colonialist propaganda. He also expressed doubts about the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

"Avanti!" said that Kuwatly received Ubodi on January 4th, before departing for visits to Pakistan and India. The newspaper recounted Kuwatly's views indirectly.

Ubodi wrote, "I asked President Kuwatly for his opinion on the news published in Western newspapers about the 'Sovietization' of his country."

"Kuwatly resolutely denied the existence of such a prospect. These reports are part of a propaganda campaign launched by colonial countries and Israel against Arab countries. The aim of Syria's foreign policy is to defend the country's independence, and it is based on the principles of maintaining equal distance from the two camps and 'active neutralism'."

Ubodi said, "When discussing the issue of the United States' Middle East policy, the Syrian President believes that any plan that wants to succeed must take into account the opinions of the people and governments of the region."

    叙总统在卡拉奇市民欢迎会上说
    容忍干涉将使独立成为空谈
    离国前重申叙利亚奉行积极的中立政策
    据新华社卡拉奇8日电　正在巴基斯坦访问的叙利亚总统库阿特利8日下午说：“叙利亚和阿拉伯国家决心拒绝不论可能来自什么地方的干涉和控制。”
    他在卡拉奇市民为他举行的一次欢迎会上说：“我们已经为我们的独立付出了非常昂贵的代价。这就是我们应当维护我们的独立而不应当容忍来自任何地方的干涉和控制的一个原因。”
    库阿特利说：“如果我们容忍干涉，独立就成为一句空话。独立是考虑采取什么行动和抵抗来自任何地方的干涉的自由。正因为是这样，我们才拒绝成为军事的或其他的基地。”
    据新华社卡拉奇8日电　巴基斯坦总统米尔扎7日设宴招待访问巴基斯坦的叙利亚总统库阿特利。
    米尔扎在宴会上致词说：巴基斯坦自一成立起，就一直奉行同阿拉伯国家友好的政策。
    他说：“我们认为，我们的目的应该是一致的，就是反对不义，维护正义。”
    据新华社9日讯　罗马消息：据意大利“前进报”报道，叙利亚总统库阿特利在对这家报纸的记者乌博迪发表谈话的时候，驳斥所谓叙利亚“苏维埃化”的消息。他说，这是殖民主义者的宣传。他并且对“艾森豪威尔主义”表示怀疑。
    “前进报”说，库阿特利在启程前往巴基斯坦和印度访问以前，在1月4日接见了乌博迪。这家报纸用间接的方式叙述了库阿特利的观点。
    乌博迪写道，“我问库阿特利总统对于西方报纸上刊登的关于他的国家‘苏维埃化’的消息有何意见。”
    “库阿特利坚决否认存在这样一种前途。这些消息是殖民主义国家和以色列为反对阿拉伯国家所发动的宣传运动的一部分。叙利亚的外交政策的目的在于保卫国家的独立，它的基础是同两个阵营保持同等距离的原则和‘积极的中立主义’的原则。”
    乌博迪说，“谈到美国的中东政策问题时，叙利亚总统认为，任何计划要是想成功的话，都必须考虑到有关地区的人民和政府的意见。”
