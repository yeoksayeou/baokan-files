	Laughter Upstream of the Dujiang River
	Xiao Ming
	Open the map, go up the Liu River in Guangxi, enter the Guizhou border through the Rong River, and then go up the longest tributary of the Rong River, the Dujiang River, and you will find the county where the Shui people live – Sandu. More than 100,000 Shui people live here, accounting for more than 61% of the county's population.

	In the north, it is the season when water turns into ice, but here it is still lush mountains and ridges, and golden oranges are competing with green leaves, shining brightly in the sunshine. How many generations have the Shui people lived and struggled on this lovely land? The old people of the Shui ethnic group said: when they were young, the old people did not tell them clearly.

	Just as the people of the whole country jubilantly celebrated the arrival of the New Year, the people of all ethnic groups in Sandu were also celebrating the establishment of the Sandu Shui Autonomous County and celebrating the New Year. In the past few days, more than 20,000 people have gathered in Sandu County, which has a population of only more than 4,000. Standing on the high ground of the county seat and looking around the surrounding hills, on the large and small roads of each hill, people carried dry food and luggage, and continuously crossed mountains and ridges to gather in the county seat; among them, there were not only young men and women carrying lusheng and wearing beautiful clothes, but also middle-aged people with children, and old people in their seventies and eighties holding crutches, some of whom traveled for two or three days. They said: "This is a day that has never happened since ancient times!" They wanted to celebrate this once-in-a-lifetime day with the representatives who were attending the first session of the Sandu Shui Autonomous County People's Congress.

	The first session of the Sandu Shui Autonomous County People's Congress is proceeding in a tense and warm atmosphere. The representatives discussed the work of the past seven years. The achievements of the past seven years are remarkable: grain output has increased by 50% compared with before liberation, green hemp has increased by one and a half times, rapeseed has increased by seven times, and cotton has increased by 39%. The number of children enrolled in school has increased sevenfold compared with before liberation, of which minority students account for 86%. The terrible epidemic disease – malaria has been basically controlled…. The representatives affirmed the achievements of the past seven years with their own feelings and the specific facts they saw with their own eyes. At the same time, they also raised many opinions and questions, such as the elderly's concerns about old cattle, the girls' demands for girls' fields, and the young people's hope to leave a Marangpo for love affairs, etc. All these many questions were fully discussed. The resolutions of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee made the representatives' eyes brighter than before. They clearly realized that the main root cause of the errors and shortcomings in the work was subjectivism and bureaucracy. They believed that in the future, after giving play to the autonomy of the Shui people, the work would make greater progress. The meeting then discussed the production increase target for 1957 and how the work in 1957 should be carried out.

	The representatives and the masses who came to the county seat to celebrate the establishment of the Shui Autonomous County spent New Year's Eve in singing and dancing, and the brisk lusheng dance music rose and fell. Here, young people opened their hearts, singing and dancing, singing happiness, and looking for love. The old people sang about their lucky old age. The happiness of the young people and the luck of the old people are all thanks to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Several Shui elders improvised and sang there: "Chairman Mao, are you near or far from me? My ears heard it but I didn't see it. With you, we have a good life. Ah! Chairman Mao, the morning star is you – Chairman Mao." "The son of the immortal came to our side, Chairman Mao led us to establish an autonomous county…."

    都江上游的欢笑
    肖明
    翻开地图，沿广西的柳江上行，经融江进入贵州境界，再沿融江最长的支流都江而上，就找到了水族人民聚居的县境——三都。这里居住着十万多水族人民，占全县人口的61％以上。
    在北方，现在正是滴水成冰的季节，而这里却还是葱山郁岭，金黄色的桔子，正与绿叶争艳，在阳光辉映下闪闪发光。水族人民在这片可爱的土地上生息斗争了多少世代，水族的老人们说：在他们年轻时，老人们就没有向他们说清。
    正当全国人民欢欣鼓舞庆祝新的一年来临的时候，三都的各族人民也在欢庆水族自治县的成立，欢庆新年。几天来，只有居民四千多人的三都县城聚居了两万多人。站在县城的高处了望四周的山岗，每个山岗的大小路上，人们背着干粮、挑着行李，络绎不绝地翻山越岭往县城汇集；其中不只有背着籚笙、身穿美丽服装的青年男女，也有携儿带女的中年人，还有手执拐杖的七、八十岁的老人，其中有的走了二天、三天的路程。他们说：“这是自古以来没有过的日子！”他们要和正在参加三都水族自治县第一届人民代表大会会议的代表们一同欢庆这个千载难逢的日子。
    三都水族自治县第一届人民代表大会正紧张而热烈地进行着。代表们讨论了七年来的工作。七年来的工作成绩是显著的：粮食产量比解放前增加了50％，青麻增产一倍半，油菜子增产七倍，棉花增产了39％。入学儿童比解放前增加七倍，其中少数民族学生占86％。可怕的流行病——疟疾已经基本上被控制住了……。代表们用自己的感受，用自己亲眼看到的具体事实肯定了七年来的成绩。同时，他们也提出了许多意见和疑问，如老年人对养老牛的忧虑，姑娘们对姑娘田的要求，年轻人希望留出谈情说爱的马郎坡等等。对这许许多多的问题，都进行了充分的讨论。中共第八次全国代表大会和八届二中全会的决议，使代表们的眼睛比以前更明亮了，他们明确地认识到工作中产生错误和缺点的主要根源是主观主义和官僚主义。他们相信在今后发挥了水族人民的自治作用以后，工作将得到更大的进展。会议接着讨论了1957年的增产指标、1957年的工作怎样进行。
    代表们和来县城庆祝水族自治县成立的群众在歌舞中度过了除夕，轻快的籚笙舞曲此起彼落。在这里，年轻人放开了胸怀，边歌边舞，歌唱着幸福，寻找着爱情。老人们歌唱着自己有这么幸运的晚年。年轻人的欢乐，老年人的幸运，这都得感谢共产党感谢毛主席。几位水族老人在那里自编自唱着：“毛主席你离我近还是远，我耳朵听见了可没看见，有了你，我们才有了好日子。啊！毛主席，早晨的星星就是你——毛主席”。“仙人的儿子来到了我们身边，毛主席领导我们成立了自治县……。”
