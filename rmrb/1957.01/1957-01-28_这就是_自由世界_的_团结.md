This is the "Unity" of the "Free World"

    Dulles Insults "Allies"
    British and French Newspapers Retaliate
    Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: British and French newspapers have expressed outrage at remarks made by Dulles on January 25th at a joint session of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees. Dulles said at the meeting that if he were to go to the Middle East to fight, he would feel much safer without British and French troops on either side of him.
    London's "The Times," "Daily Express," and "Daily Mail" all regarded Dulles's words as an "insult." "The Times" also worried that Dulles's words would strain Anglo-American and Franco-American relations. "News Chronicle" pointed out that Dulles was "advocating a separate American policy in the Near East without the participation of the two allies, Britain and France."
    Paris's "France-Soir" considered Dulles's words "clumsy," and said his words "made Paris feel sad." The Catholic "La Croix" emphasized that all of Dulles's reasons had a "strong smell of petroleum."
    Another right-wing newspaper, "L'Aurore," also expressed dissatisfaction with Dulles's blatant attempt to "replace" French and British influence in the Middle East with American power.

    Washington "Star" Says
    Neutral Tendency in Western Europe Deepens
    Xinhua News Agency, January 26th: Washington: The "Star" published an article by Brown on the 22nd, saying: "Not only in Britain, but in all other Western European countries, there is a strong and possibly increasingly strong tendency toward neutralism."
    Analyzing the origins of Western European neutralism, Brown pointed out: One fact is that "Soviet atomic bombers can reach every European capital in just a few minutes... Medium-range or even short-range missiles can fire nuclear warheads at Britain, France, or Belgium... or anywhere else in Europe."
    At the same time, "it can be reasonably expected that the Western European economy will shift more or less to the East rather than the West."

    Resisting the Influx of American Agricultural Products
    British House of Commons Approves "Anti-Dumping" Law
    Xinhua News Agency, January 26th: London: The British House of Commons approved an "anti-dumping" bill proposed by the government on the 22nd.
    When explaining the bill to the House of Commons, British Trade Minister Eccles said that the bill would authorize the British Board of Trade to levy tariffs on goods "dumped" in Britain or "artificially brought into Britain with the aid of subsidies."
    Eccles also said that the bill would allow the Board of Trade to impose tariffs on goods that "would damage long-established sources of supply once imported." For example, this would include someone selling "subsidized food" in Britain.

    Georgia Discriminates Against Japanese Textiles
    Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry Expresses Dissatisfaction
    Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: Tokyo: The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry said on the 25th that it considered the bill passed by the Georgia House of Representatives on the 24th, which discriminates against Japanese textiles, to be unfriendly.
    The bill requires stores in Georgia that sell Japanese textiles to use prominent signs to indicate that they are selling Japanese textiles. The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry said that the nature of this bill is the same as a law enacted by South Carolina last year, which the Japanese government protested to the U.S. government. If the Georgia bill is approved by the state Senate and the governor, the Japanese government will consider this a violation of the Japan-U.S. "Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation."

    这就是“自由世界”的“团结”
    杜勒斯侮辱“盟友”
    英法报纸以牙还牙
    据新华社27日讯　英国和法国报纸对于杜勒斯25日在美国参议院外交和军事委员会的联席会议上所说的话表示愤慨。杜勒斯在这次会议上说，如果他自己到中东去作战，他宁愿左右没有英国兵和法国兵，这样他会觉得安全得多。
    伦敦“泰晤士报”、“每日快报”和“每日简报”都把杜勒斯的话看作是一种“侮辱”。“泰晤士报”并且耽心杜勒斯的这些话会使英美关系和法美关系紧张起来。“新闻纪事报”指出，杜勒斯是“主张在近东实行不要英法两个盟国参加的单独的美国政策”。
    巴黎“法兰西晚报”认为，杜勒斯的话是“笨拙的”，他的话“使巴黎感到悲哀”。天主教的“十字架晚报”着重指出，杜勒斯的一切理由都带有“强烈的石油气味”。
    另一家右派报纸“震旦报”也对杜勒斯露骨地企图在中东以美国势力“代替”法国和英国的势力表示不满。
    华盛顿“明星报”说
    西欧国家中立倾向加深
    据新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：“明星报”22日刊载布朗的一篇文章说：“不仅在英国，而且在所有的其他西欧国家都存在着强烈的而且可能是越来越强烈的中立主义倾向。”
    布朗在分析西欧中立主义的起源时指出：一个事实是，“苏联原子轰炸机只需几分钟就可以飞到每一个欧洲国家首都……中距离的或者甚至是短距离的导弹就能把核子弹头射到英国、法国或比利时……或者欧洲任何其他地方。”
    同时，“可以合理地预料西欧经济将或多或少地转向东方而不是西方”。
    抵拒美国农产品的涌进
    英下院批准“反倾销”法
    据新华社26日讯　伦敦消息：英国下院22日批准了政府所提出的一项“反倾销”法案。
    英国贸易大臣埃克尔斯在向下院解释这项法案的时候说，这项法案将授权英国贸易部对于在英国“倾销”的货物或者是“人为地借助于津贴而运到英国的货物”征收关税。
    埃克尔斯还说，这个法案将允许贸易部对那些“一旦进口就会损害由来已久的供应来源”的货物征收关税。譬如，如果有人在英国出卖“得到津贴的食物”就属于这个范围。
    佐治亚州歧视日本纺织品
    日通商产业省表示不满
    据新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本通商产业省25日说，它认为美国佐治亚州众议院在24日通过的歧视日本纺织品的法案是不友好的。
    这个法案要求佐治亚州出售日本纺织品的商店都要用显著的标志说明它们出售日本纺织品。日本通商产业省说，这个法案的性质和美国南卡罗来纳州去年制定的一项法令一样，日本政府曾经就这项法令向美国政府提出抗议。如果佐治亚州的法案得到州参议院和州长的批准，日本政府将认为这是违反日美“友好、通商和航海条约”的。
