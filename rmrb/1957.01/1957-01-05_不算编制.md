    Not Counted in the Establishment
    Section Chief of the Cadre Department: With the streamlining of organizations and the reduction of personnel everywhere, the cadre department has a lot of trouble. My wife's illness is about to be completely cured, why don't you let her fill in at your place? I guarantee she won't be counted in your establishment.

    Section Chief of the Secretariat: No, if another one comes, there will already be two cadres not within the establishment of the section. Wouldn't the secretariat become a sanatorium for idle people from the cadre department?

    Section Chief of the Cadre Department: Isn't this implementing the spirit of strengthening the grassroots? Those of us who are engaged in leadership work should strengthen the overall view, and proper arrangements should be made for the section chief's wife. To be honest, the cadre department has plenty of cadres. Won't we just transfer her after this wave is over?

    不算编制
    干部处长：到处在精简机构，减缩人员，给干部部门增加不少麻烦。某处长爱人的病即将全愈，充实到你们这儿算了，保证不算你们的编制。
    秘书科长：不行，再来一个已经有两个干部不在科编制以内了，这样秘书科不成了干部处的闲人疗养所了吗？
    干部处长：这不是贯彻充实基层的精神吗？我们这些搞领导工作的，应该加强全面观点，对处长的爱人就应该妥善安排。老实说，干部部门有的是干部，浪头过后再给你调换还不行吗？
