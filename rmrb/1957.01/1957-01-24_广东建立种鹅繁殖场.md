Guangdong Establishes Goose Breeding Farm

(Our dispatch) The Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture recently established the province's first goose breeding farm in Chenghai County. Some time ago, the farm selected and purchased a batch of Lion Head geese for breeding. The Provincial Department of Agriculture also transferred more than ten experienced old farmers and technicians from Yuepu, Qishan and other well-known Lion Head goose producing areas to the farm to work as breeders. Currently, the farm is planning to build goose houses, construct canals, and cultivate 300 mu of grassland and vegetable plots on more than 1,000 mu of land to solve the problem of feed for the breeding geese. It is estimated that by the end of this year, a large number of Lion Head geese, each weighing 20 to 30 jin, will begin to be promoted and bred throughout Guangdong Province. (Xiao Jincheng)

    广东建立种鹅繁殖场
    本报讯　广东省农业厅最近在澄海县建立了全省第一个种鹅繁殖场。前些时候，这个场已选购到一批狮头鹅进行饲养，省农业厅并从著名的狮头鹅原产地——月浦、岐山等地，抽调有多年养鹅经验的老农和技术员十多人到这个场担任饲养工作。现在，这个场正计划在一千多亩场地上陆续兴建鹅舍、修筑水渠，开辟三百亩草地和种植蔬菜，解决种鹅的饲料问题。预计到今年年底，将有大批每只重达二、三十斤的狮头鹅开始在广东省各地推广繁殖。（肖俊城）
