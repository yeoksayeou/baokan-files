Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 9th: A medical device for directly diagnosing pathological changes inside the heart—the "cardioscope"—has been successfully trial-produced by Shi Huayu, a professor and thoracic surgery expert at Zhejiang Medical College, and his assistants, physicians Wu Dingkai and Lu Jin.

The successful trial production of this instrument for examining the inside of the heart makes a significant contribution to performing internal heart surgery. Using this instrument, the tiniest lesions can be seen inside the patient's heart, unimpeded by the blood, thereby establishing a definitive diagnosis.

The "cardioscope" is a simply constructed instrument made using optics and a special principle that prevents blood from obscuring the line of sight. It is slightly thicker and longer than a fountain pen, with lenses at both ends. After opening the patient's chest cavity, the doctor inserts the front end of the "cardioscope" into the patient's heart. After turning on the power, the doctor can directly observe various conditions inside the heart through the eyepiece, and then determine whether surgery is needed or the extent of the operation. Moreover, after the surgery is completed, the "cardioscope" can also be used to check whether the surgery was performed perfectly.

    试制成功诊断心脏病的心脏镜
    据新华社杭州9日电　直接诊断心脏内部病理变化的医疗器械——“心脏镜”，已经由浙江医学院教授、胸腔外科专家石华玉和他的助手吴定凯、陆瑾医师等试制成功。
    这种检查心脏内部的器械的试制成功，对施行心脏内部手术有着重大的贡献。应用这种器械。可以不受病人心脏中血液的阻碍，在病人的心脏中看到最细小的病灶，从而确定诊断。
    “心脏镜”是应用光学和一种特殊的不受血液遮蔽视线的原理而制成的一种构造简单的器械。它的形体比自来水笔略粗、稍长，两端装有透镜。医生在打开病人胸腔后，就把“心脏镜”的前端插到病人的心脏中去，通电后，医生就可在装有目镜的一端，直接观察心脏内部的各种病情，然后确定是否需要施行手术或动手术的范围。而且在做完手术以后，还可以用“心脏镜”来检查手术是否做得完善。
