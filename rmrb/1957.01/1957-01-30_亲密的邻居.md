A small river separates two agricultural cooperatives: on one side is the Jinming Agricultural Cooperative (advanced cooperative) of Jinshansi Township, Ningqiang County, Shaanxi; on the other side is the Jiepai Agricultural Cooperative (elementary cooperative) of Liujia Township, Qingchuan County, Sichuan.

The two cooperatives help each other in production, learn from each other's strengths, and make up for each other's weaknesses, as close as two production teams in the same cooperative. In the past, the wheat of the Jiepai Cooperative was mostly broadcast or dibbled, which was inconvenient to manage and the yield was low. In the autumn of the year before last, the Jiepai Cooperative learned from the experience of the Jinming Cooperative and changed all the wheat fields to row planting, and also exchanged wheat and corn seeds with each other, and both crops achieved bumper harvests. Last year, the Jinming Cooperative adopted the "Manggu Seed" rice variety from the Jiepai Cooperative and achieved a rice harvest for the first time. Last summer, when the drought was severe, the Jiepai Cooperative used wooden pedal waterwheels to draw water for irrigation, but the effect was not very good. The Jinming Cooperative then spared two water-absorbing bamboo dragons to lend to the Jiepai Cooperative, enabling the Jiepai Cooperative to effectively carry out the drought resistance struggle, and the members of the Jiepai Cooperative were very grateful. Whenever there were plays or movie screenings, the two cooperatives would send invitations to each other, inviting their neighbors to watch. Now, the two cooperatives are preparing to jointly build a large dam, and the name of the dam has already been chosen, called the "Sichuan-Shaanxi Dam."

What a close and harmonious pair of neighbors!

A person cannot live in isolation, and an agricultural cooperative that unites farmers to build a new life cannot be isolated from its neighbors. All neighboring agricultural cooperatives should establish close and harmonious relationships in order to communicate with each other, exchange experiences, and help each other. In the past, some unpleasant disputes have occurred between agricultural cooperatives in some neighboring areas in terms of utilizing water conservancy, grasslands, and developing mountain forests. These agricultural cooperatives should learn from the Jinming Agricultural Cooperative and the Jiepai Agricultural Cooperative.

    亲密的邻居
    一条小河隔着两个农业合作社：一边是陕西宁强县金山寺乡金明农业社（高级社）；一边是四川青川县刘家乡界牌农业社（初级社）。
    两个社在生产上互相帮助，取长补短，亲密得好像一个社的两个生产队一样。界牌社的小麦过去大部是撒播或点播，管理不便，产量也低。前年秋季，界牌社就学习金明社的经验把全部麦田改成条播，还互相调换了麦种和玉米种，这两种庄稼都获得丰产。金明社去年采用了界牌社的水稻品种“蛮谷种”，初次获得了水稻丰收。去年夏季，旱象严重的时候，界牌社用木板脚踏水车取水浇田，效果不大好。金明社就腾出两只吸水竹龙借给界牌社，使界牌社得以有效地进行抗旱斗争，界牌社的社员们很感激。两个社每逢演戏、放映电影，都互相下请贴，邀邻居来观看。现在，两个社正准备合修一条大堤，堤的名称已经起好了，叫做“川陕堤”。
    多么亲密、多么融洽的一对邻居！
    一个人不可能离群索居，一个团结农民们建立新生活的农业社更不能同邻居隔绝。一切互相比邻的农业社之间，都应当建立亲密、融洽的关系，以便互通声气，交流经验，彼此帮助。过去，有少数邻近地区的农业社之间曾经在利用水利、草原以及开发山林等方面发生了一些不愉快的纠纷。这些农业社应当向金明农业社和界牌农业社看齐。
