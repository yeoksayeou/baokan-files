    How Can You Force Those Who Don't Raise Pigs
    To Sell Pigs to the Food Company?

    The New Year and holidays are supposed to be happy occasions, but some farmers in the Gaiping area of Liaoning Province are worried about them. They are not worried about firewood or rice, but about the food company forcing them to sell pigs. Those who have pigs must sell them, and those who don't have pigs must spend money to buy pigs to sell to the food company. It's not just the trouble, but buying and then selling at a loss, which is distressing, isn't it?

    Gao Shouhong, a member of the Kaohezhai Agricultural Cooperative in the Jiuzhai District, bought a pig at the market for 59 yuan and then sold it to the food company for 44 yuan, losing 15 yuan. Gao Shouhong is not the only one doing this, and it's not just a one-time occurrence.

    When the purchasing agents of the Gaiping County Food Company went to the countryside to buy pigs, they did not properly publicize the policy to the masses. What the masses heard from them was: "We don't need these pigs, the army needs them, and we can't fail to complete the task..." Selling pigs to the state to support socialist construction should be considered an honor, but why not properly publicize this to the masses and instead say that the pigs are needed by the army and must be sold? This practice by some purchasing personnel of the Gaiping County Food Company is clearly wrong, and it is hoped that the relevant departments will investigate and correct it. 　Tixiao (啼笑 - literally "cry-laugh" suggesting irony or absurdity)

    My home is in Xingfu Township, Songshu District, Fuxian County, Liaoning Province. Recently, I received a letter from home saying that the local regulations state: for every three households that raise pigs, one must sell a pig to the state. My family didn't want to sell our pig because it was still small, so we had to join with two other households to buy a fat pig at the market to sell. It cost us 88 yuan to buy, and we only got 34.90 yuan when we sold it to the food company, a total loss of 53.10 yuan for the three families.

    Even a month ago, I heard that farmers in my hometown were slaughtering their New Year pigs because they were afraid of being forced to sell them. This situation is obviously caused by the local forced purchase of live pigs.

    I believe that if we explain to the farmers the significance of selling pigs to the state for supporting construction, they will be willing to sell their fat pigs to the state. However, if we do not publicize and explain to the masses, but only use coercive methods to purchase, it will not only cause dissatisfaction among the masses and damage the state's political prestige, but it will also dampen the enthusiasm of the masses for developing pig production, reduce future pig sources, and make procurement even more difficult.　Li Jing

    Don't Slaughter Small Pigs

    Recently, the pork I have seen in the market in Dazhu County, Sichuan Province, has mostly come from small pigs weighing only a few dozen pounds, some only forty or fifty pounds. I think, if these young pigs are slaughtered, where will the fat pigs come from? This will inevitably make the future pork supply even more strained. This method of "curing the immediate sore while digging out the heart" urgently needs to be corrected. It is hoped that the relevant departments will consider the long-term interests of the people and not slaughter small pigs.

    The Ramie Market in Fenyi County Is Too Chaotic

    Fenyi County, Jiangxi Province, produces an average of about 600,000 jin of ramie per year. In recent years, the ramie market in Fenyi County has been very chaotic. The black market for ramie has long existed, with prices more than double the official price. Many agricultural cooperatives are willing to sell freely on the market and demand the abolition of the ramie pre-purchase contracts signed with the state, or simply fail to fulfill the contracts. The state procurement department only completed about 55% of its task last year, and it was not completed the year before either.

    State-owned commercial departments often only carry out the procurement of ramie, and have not well strengthened their leadership over the ramie market, which is one of the reasons for the chaos in the ramie market. Last year, between May and June, the procurement department saw new ramie coming onto the market and purchased it in large quantities, rarely releasing it. The masses could not buy ramie, so they rushed to buy it everywhere, and the price of ramie therefore rose from 1.20 yuan to 1.60 yuan (per jin).

    After the price of ramie fluctuated in the market, the responsible department did not adopt the method of persuading and educating the masses, but adopted compulsory measures. The procurement department sent cadres out to patrol and seize ramie whenever they saw it. Sometimes, they even purchased ramie that the masses had bought from the market at the official price. As a result, no ramie was available on the market, and the masses secretly traded in the mountains two or three li away from the market town, in the corners of houses.

    The relevant leading organs of Jiangxi Province, Nanchang Prefecture, and Fenyi County have long known about the chaotic situation in the ramie market in Fenyi County, but some people have shirked their management responsibilities, citing the excuse that "ramie is a material controlled by the central government, and we have no ability to solve it." This bureaucratic style of the leading organs has prevented problems that could be solved in the ramie market from being solved.　Chang Fengchun

    Why Is No One Buying the Sunflower Seeds Harvested by the Children?

    Recently, the Young Pioneers of Rouyuan Town Complete Primary School in Huachi County, Gansu Province, Huchang Primary School in Jiangling County, Hubei Province, Nantun Primary School in Zou County, Shandong Province, and many other schools have written to say that they have no place to dedicate or sell the sunflower and other oilseeds they have harvested to the state.

    Shidaojie Primary School in Lingqian District, Dalian City, enthusiastically launched the "Small Five-Year Plan" activity last spring. More than 500 students used the school's open space to plant a lot of sunflowers, and harvested more than 100 jin of sunflower seeds in the autumn. However, they did not know how to dedicate this gift to the state; at the same time, they inquired everywhere and did not know where to sell it. They sent two classmates to the Stalin Road Purchasing Station in the wind and snow to contact them, but they still did not want it. The students were so anxious that they said: We watered, weeded, and fertilized for several months to get these fruits of labor, can we just let them rot?

    Cherish the enthusiasm of the children!
                          Kang Jian

    怎能叫没有养猪的人
    也卖猪给食品公司？
    过年、过节本来是值得人们高兴的一件事，可是在辽宁省盖平地区有些农民却为年节而发愁。他们愁的并不是柴、米问题，而是怕食品公司强迫他们卖猪。有猪的卖猪，没有猪的也得花钱买猪来卖给食品公司。费点事还算不了什么，可是买了再卖，得赔许多钱，这能不叫人犯愁吗？
    九寨区靠河寨乡农业社社员高守鸿在市场花五十九元买来一口猪，再以四十四元卖给食品公司，赔了十五元。这样做的不只是高守鸿一人，更不只是一次。
    盖平县食品公司的收购员下乡买猪的时候并没有正确地向群众宣传，群众从他们那里听到的是：“这批猪不是我们要的，是军队要的，完不成任务不行……”群众把生猪卖给国家，支援社会主义建设，应该说是一种光荣的事，可是为什么不好好向群众宣传，却把收购生猪说成是军队要的，非要卖不可呢？盖平县食品公司某些收购人员的这种作法显然是不对的，希望有关部门检查纠正。　啼　笑
    我家住在辽宁省复县松树区幸福乡，最近家里给我来信说，当地规定：凡是养猪的，三家中必须卖一口猪给国家。我家因为养的猪还小，舍不得卖，只好同另外两家到市场上去伙买了一头肥猪来卖。买时共花了八十八元，转卖给食品公司只得了三十四元九角，三家共赔了五十三元一角。
    还是在一个月以前，我就听说家乡的农民因为怕被强迫卖猪而纷纷宰杀自己养的过年猪。这种情况，显然是当地强迫收购生猪而引起的。
    我认为，只要向农民说明卖猪给国家对支援建设的意义，他们是愿意把肥猪卖给国家的。但是，如果不向群众宣传解释，只是用强迫的办法来收购，不但会引起群众不满，给国家政治威信造成损失，而且也会打击群众发展养猪生产的积极性，使将来的猪源减少，收购也就更困难。　李靖
    不要宰小猪
    近来我在四川省大竹县市场上看到的猪肉大都是几十斤重的小猪宰出来的，有的只有四五十斤。我想，如果把这些架子猪宰了，肥猪又从哪里来呢？势必使将来的猪肉供应情况更加紧张。这种“医得眼前疮，挖却心头肉”的办法亟须纠正，希望有关部门为人民长远利益着想，不要宰杀小猪了。

    分宜县的苎麻市场太混乱
    江西省分宜县平均年产苎麻六十万斤左右。几年来，分宜县的苎麻市场显得很混乱。苎麻黑市长期存在，价格超过牌价一倍以上。不少农业社情愿在市场上自由出售，而要求废除和国家签订的苎麻预购合同或干脆不履行合同。国家采购部门的任务去年只完成55％左右，前年也没有完成。
    国营商业部门往往只进行苎麻的收购工作，没很好地加强对苎麻市场的领导，是苎麻市场混乱的一个原因。去年五六月间，采购部门看见新麻上市，便大量收购，很少吐出。群众买不到麻，就到处抢购，麻价因此便由一元二角涨到一元六角（每斤）。
    市场上麻价发生波动以后，主管部门不是采取向群众说服教育的方法，而采取了强迫命令的手段。采购部门曾派干部出去巡查，见麻就抢购。有时竟把群众从市场上买来的麻，也按牌价收购了。结果，无麻上市，群众偷偷摸摸地躲在离集镇二三里的山上，屋角里进行交易。
    江西省、南昌专区和分宜县的有关领导机关，早知道分宜县苎麻市场混乱的情况，可是，有些人借口“苎麻是中央掌握的物资，我们无力解决”而推卸管理的责任。领导机关的这种官僚主义作风就使苎麻市场上可能解决的问题，没有得到解决。　常逢春
    孩子们收获的向日葵籽为什么没有人收购？
    近来，甘肃华池县柔远镇完全小学、湖北江陵县胡场小学、山东邹县南屯小学等不少学校的少先队来信说：他们收获的向日葵等油料，竟没有地方可以向国家献礼或卖给国家。
    旅大市岭前区石道街小学，去年春天热烈开展了“小五年计划”活动，五百多个学生利用学校空地种了很多向日葵，秋天收获了一百多斤葵花籽。可是，不知道该怎样把这份礼物献给国家；同时，到处打听也不知道哪里收购。派了两个同学冒着风雪到斯大林路收购站去联系，结果还是不要。急得同学们说：我们几个月浇水、锄草、施肥，得到了这些劳动果实，能就让它烂掉吗？
    珍重孩子们的热情吧！
