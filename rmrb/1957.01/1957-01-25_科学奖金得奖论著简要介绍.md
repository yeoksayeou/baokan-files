Xinhua News Agency, January 24th - The authors of the thirty-four research dissertations that won the 1956 Academic Awards of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Natural Science Section) have made certain contributions to the development of China's science and national construction. Some of the research results have reached or approached the world's advanced level. These dissertations were all published in the years since the founding of the People's Republic.

    Qian Xuesen, a mechanician, in his book "Engineering Cybernetics," combines general and comprehensive theory with practical experience, and comprehensively explores the theory of automatic control and automatic adjustment of various engineering and technical systems. On the one hand, it lays the theoretical foundation for the technical science of engineering cybernetics, and on the other hand, it opens up its future research fields. This book introduces new contributions such as linear systems with time lag, linear systems with variable coefficients, and the application of ballistic perturbation methods in control design.

    The research of mathematician Hua Luogeng obtained some basic formulas for the theory of multiple complex variable functions on typical domains. He used creative methods that had not been used by his predecessors to do pioneering work in this field of mathematics. His work will affect the development of the theory of multivariable harmonic functions and partial differential equations. The theory of multiple complex variable functions is an important and immature discipline in mathematics, and it is in a period of rapid growth and development in recent years.

    Mathematician Wu Wenjun's research results have promoted the development of a branch of geometry - topology, and have attracted the attention of international topologists. His research results on the basic problem of topology - characteristic classes, have reached a very complete degree. "The problem of realizing compound shapes in Euclidean space" is an important problem in mathematics, and there have been no outstanding results in the past two decades. Wu Wenjun used a topological property - the display class, combined with the development of modern topology, to provide a way to solve such problems.

    These three works all won first prizes.

    Mathematician Su Buqing put forward more than a dozen papers on the geometry of K-expansion space and general metric space. Judging from the research of these generalized spaces, his work has reached a fairly high level. In addition, the "singular point representation method" he created can be used to deal with problems in the projective theory of space curves. This method has now been adopted by relevant books in many countries.

    The group of five papers "On the Large Deflection Problem of Elastic Circular Thin Plates" by mechanician Qian Weichang in cooperation with young researchers Hu Haichang and Ye Kaiyuan solved the problem that had not been well solved in the past by using the perturbation method proposed by Qian Weichang. The solution to this problem is of great help to the design of aircraft, ships, and some instruments. In academic terms, the thin plate perturbation method has been exemplified and tested through this set of papers, becoming a method with practical basis.

    The study of internal friction of metals has developed into an important way to study the microstructure and atomic movement of metals in the past 20 years. The eleven papers on the internal friction and mechanical properties of metals by physicist Ge Tingsui and his assistants represent the author's achievements in further developing the research on internal friction in China since 1950.

    Dynamicist Wu Zhonghua only returned from the United States at the end of 1954. Among the six papers on gas turbines that won the award, three were written in less than two years after returning to China. He proposed new calculation methods for gas thermodynamic properties and design methods for blade cascades, which are of great significance to the design and development of gas turbines. Because of its small size, light weight and high efficiency, the gas turbine has become the most important power machinery in modern aviation, and is rapidly expanding its application to power generation, locomotives, ships, automobiles and other aspects.

    For a large genus in the family Scrophulariaceae of plants - the genus Pedicularis, botanist Zhong Buqiu has conducted comprehensive and in-depth research at home and abroad for more than ten years. He proposed a more complete new system. His treatise on this work can be said to be the most in-depth and comprehensive work in systematic classification in China since the advent of plant taxonomy.

    The above five research dissertations all won second prizes.

    In mechanics, physics, and chemistry, a total of nine works won third prizes.

    Female mechanician Li Minhua studied the "general large strain problem" that is developing in plasticity mechanics. Starting from the theory of deformation, she studied the axisymmetric plane stress problem, and made new creations in the solution method, which greatly improved the previous experimental method and step-by-step approximation method. The author's calculation results in this regard can be applied to mechanical design.

    Hu Haichang, twenty-eight years old, graduated from university in 1950. He is now an associate researcher at the Institute of Mechanics. He has made good achievements in his short years of work. Some of his research results on the space problem of transversely isotropic elastic solid mechanics are somewhat creative in academic terms, and some are more universal than others.

    Physicist Huang Kun's seven papers on crystal lattice theory systematically studied crystal lattice theory, and proposed a quantitative theoretical basis for the change of electronic state in crystals in the work of F-center.

    Female physicist He Zehui and her collaborators Lu Zuyin and Sun Hancheng's trial-produced nuclear emulsion, as well as physicist Dai Chuanzeng, Li Deping and their collaborators Xiang Zhilin, Tang Xiaowei, and Li Zhongzhen (female)'s trial-produced halogen counters and high-current tubes are all important tools for studying atomic nuclei and cosmic rays. Their performance is good. These two works are helpful for China to carry out research on nuclear physics and cosmic rays and the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    Organic chemist Zhu Ziqing and his collaborators Lu Renrong and Huang Wenkui conducted a systematic study on the chemical structure of fritillary alkaloids, which advanced China's research in this area.

    Organic chemist Wang You and his collaborators Ding Hongxun, Tu Chuanzhong, and Jia Chengwu conducted a systematic study of the chemistry of citrinin (an antibiotic). The old structural formula of citrinin was revised, and new experimental basis was put forward. They carried out the resolution and synthesis of isomers of citrinin and its related compounds, and made certain contributions to the stereochemistry of citrinin.

    Physical chemist Tang Aoqing used the method of quantum mechanics to study several problems such as chemical bond functions and intramolecular rotation, making them more generalized and systematic, which contributed to the theory of molecular structure.

    Physical chemist Qian Renyuan and others' research on the determination of molecular weight of polymer compounds has improved the existing methods and pointed out many factors that were ignored by predecessors. It has laid a certain foundation for further development of theoretical research on polymer chemistry. In order to control the properties and quality of polymer compounds (such as rubber, plastic, etc.), it is very important to accurately determine the molecular weight of polymer compounds.

    In biology and geology, nine works won third prizes.

    The research results of Zhu Xi, Zeng Chengkui, Yuan Qingzhi, etc. have respectively promoted the development of silkworm silk, laver and animal husbandry production. Zhu Xi and his collaborators Zhang Guo, Jiang Tianji, and Wang Gaoshun, after four years of efforts, clarified certain environmental conditions suitable for the life of castor silkworm, studied the method of raising castor silkworm in China, and have been promoted and raised in Anhui, Jiangsu, Henan and other provinces. Zeng Chengkui and his collaborator Zhang Derui's research on laver is a good example of theory serving production practice. After several years of research, they revealed several doubts in the life history of laver, proved that the spores of Conchocelis develop into laver, and economically solved the important problem in the laver aquaculture industry - the source of laver spores, creating good conditions for the development of the laver aquaculture industry. The vaccine for preventing rinderpest studied by Yuan Qingzhi and his collaborators Shen Rongxian, Ujiie Bachiang, and Li Baoqi played a significant role in eliminating rinderpest in China.

    One of the award-winning papers belongs to medicine, which is Feng Lanzhou's many important discoveries in filariasis and its vectors. His research results are of great value in academic and eradicating filariasis. He is the most contributory parasitologist in China in the study of filariasis.

    The five research results belonging to geoscience solved some theoretical and technical problems in strata identification, geological exploration, mineral exploration, and weather forecasting.

    Wang Yu, Lu Yanhai, Yang Jingzhi, Mu Enzhi, and Sheng Jinzhang's "Stratigraphy of the Taizi River Basin in Eastern Liaoning" enabled people to have a clearer and more correct understanding of the strata in this area, and corrected some errors made by Japanese geologists in the past in dividing the strata in this area and comparing them with strata in other regions.

    Geophysicist Fu Chengyi studied the propagation theory of elastic waves, solved some important problems in it, and proposed an improved method for seismic prospecting, solving some link problems in seismic prospecting. Seismic prospecting is an important development direction of geophysical prospecting.

    The first paleogeographic map of China drawn by Liu Hongyun summarized the paleogeographic data from Sinian to Triassic, which is helpful for some aspects of geological surveying and general mineral exploration, and provides many conveniences for the teaching and research of Chinese geological science.

    Physicist Zhang Yuanlong is the first person in China to use his own designed differential thermal analyzer in combination with X-rays to study mineral phase changes. He studied the heating phase transformation of gibbsite and the exothermic reaction of kaolinite, and obtained new results. These results were used to explore the laws of survival of these two kinds of ores and other related aluminum-containing ores in nature.

    Due to the vast space it occupies, the Tibetan Plateau has a profound impact on the East Asian atmospheric circulation and China's weather. Meteorologists Ye Duzheng and Gu Zhenchao revealed the thermal and dynamic effects of the Tibetan Plateau, demonstrated its impact on China's weather and East Asian atmospheric circulation, and clarified the relationship between China's weather and climate characteristics and the Tibetan Plateau in each season.

    Among the twenty-six research results that won the third prize, the eight works in technical science have contributed to the construction of China's civil engineering, metallurgical industry and petroleum industry, and chemical industry.

    Soil mechanicist Wang Wenshao studied the electroosmosis problem in soil mechanics, and put forward his own views, which has considerable effect on clarifying the divergent views of scholars on the mechanical laws in electroosmosis in the past.

    Structural engineer Cai Fangyin's book "Analysis of Variable Section Rigid Frame" and three papers comprehensively discussed various methods of rigid frame analysis by scholars at home and abroad, and put forward some new principles and methods, solving long-standing problems in structural mechanics, which is of great help to the design and calculation work of building engineering structures.

    Metallurgist Li Xun and others first established a device for determining hydrogen in steel in China, studied the law of hydrogen content change in molten steel during the smelting process of electric furnaces and open hearth furnaces, and did meticulous work on the problem of hydrogen segregation in steel ingots, and obtained some new results, correcting many incorrect views in the past. It is of great help to improve the steel smelting process, improve the quality and output of steel.

    Metallurgist Wu Ziliang and his assistant successfully trial-produced a manganese-molybdenum alloy steel to replace the commonly used 40X steel, and conducted research on boron steel. Many commonly used alloy steels abroad generally contain nickel or chromium, and China lacks nickel, chromium and other resources. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously carry out the work of finding alloy steel substitutes in the future. This work represents a direction of development. And because the author considered the whole problem in detail, this work has a fairly high level.

    Old metallurgist Zhou Ren and metallurgists Zhou Xingjian, Zou Yuanxi, and Li Lin (female) and others' research on ductile iron has achieved results. The magnesium addition method using "magnesium chip knot" or "magnesium silicon chip mixed knot" can simplify the treatment process, creating conditions for mass production, and can save precious metals such as copper and nickel. The research on casting automobile crankshafts and piston rings with ductile iron has been successful, which will have practical significance for China's automobile production. These achievements have played a positive role in the rapid promotion and use of ductile iron in China.

    A phenomenon clarified by metallurgist Ke Jun in the study of the change of the crystal structure of steel during heat treatment has not been discovered by predecessors. Further development of his work will enable people to further control the heat treatment operation of steel.

    The research of petrochemicalist Peng Shaoyi and Guo Xiexian, Chen Yingwu, Zhang Yuanqi, etc. on the aromatization of synthetic gasoline has obtained a highly active and stable catalyst, solving the coordination of the catalyst reaction cycle and regeneration and product separation problems. This research work started from laboratory research, and then went through medium-sized factory trials to reach factory design. It is a relatively complete process research work, which is still rare in China's chemical industry research.

    Young petrochemical research workers Lou Nanquan, Zhang Cunhao, Wang Shanjun, and Lu Peizhang have achieved very good results in the research of using molten iron catalyst for fluidized bed synthesis of synthetic petroleum from water gas, which will have a significant impact on the development of the synthetic petroleum industry and the chemical industry.
