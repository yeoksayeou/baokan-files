    Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch from Algeria: Algerian bus workers, steel workers, dock workers, and postal workers, responding to the call of the Algerian General Confederation of Labor, held a 24-hour strike on the 3rd. On this day, merchants also held a market strike, and students held a strike against classes.
    This strike, market boycott, and class boycott were to protest the atrocities of the French colonialists. When the "President of the Association of Mayors of Algeria," Froger, who was killed by insurgents on December 29th last year, was being buried, the French colonialists took the opportunity to provoke, killing six Algerians and wounding nearly one hundred people. This atrocity aroused great anger among the Algerian working people. The Algerian General Confederation of Labor's call for a strike was in response to this bloody atrocity. Prior to this, tram workers and auto workers in Algiers had already held a protest strike on December 31st.
    In various regions of Algeria, National Liberation Army units continued to fight against the French colonial army. In recent days, there have been fierce battles in Constantine Province, Kabylia, near Achazga, and in the Sidi, Ali, Bouna, and Nab districts.

    抗议法国殖民者的暴行
    阿尔及利亚人民罢工罢课罢市
    新华社4日讯　阿尔及利亚消息：阿尔及利亚公共汽车工人、钢铁工人、码头工人、邮政工作人员响应阿尔及利亚总工会的号召，在3日举行了二十四小时罢工。这一天，商人还举行了罢市，学生也举行了罢课。
    这次罢工、罢市和罢课是为了抗议法国殖民者的暴行。法国殖民者在去年12月29日被起义者打死的“阿尔及利亚市长协会”主席弗罗日出殡的时候乘机挑衅，打死了六个阿尔及利亚人，打伤了将近一百人。这一暴行激起了阿尔及利亚劳动人民的极大愤怒。阿尔及利亚总工会的罢工号召就是针对这次流血暴行而发的。在这以前，阿尔及尔市的电车工人和汽车工人在12月31日已经举行过一次抗议罢工。
    在阿尔及利亚各个地区，民族解放军部队继续对法国殖民军队进行战斗。最近几天中，在君士坦丁省、卡比利亚、阿查兹加附近和西迪、阿利、布纳、纳布区等地都有激烈战斗。
