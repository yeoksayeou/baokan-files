Xinhua News Agency, December 12th – The "PLA Daily," published by the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, published an editorial today calling on PLA officers to buy no meat and less New Year goods during the Spring Festival, so as to leave the meat and New Year goods to the people and soldiers.

The editorial first summarized the current prosperous situation in the Chinese market, pointing out that due to the rapid improvement of people's living standards and the growth of purchasing power, some non-staple foods are not sufficient, and the supply of meat is a more prominent difficulty in the supply of non-staple foods. This difficult situation, as well as the supply of other items, will inevitably become more tense during the Spring Festival.

The editorial said that the Party and the government are paying great attention to solving this problem. Our army, especially the officers, should enthusiastically help the government to do this work. The editorial called on officers to learn from the spirit of government cadres in some places who have decided not to buy meat or buy less New Year goods during the Spring Festival, so as to leave the meat and New Year goods to the officers and soldiers and the people. Officers should leave the meat and New Year goods to the people and soldiers.

The "PLA Daily" editorial finally called on officers and soldiers to always maintain the traditional style of sharing weal and woe with the people.

    解放军报发表社论
    号召军官春节不买肉类少买年货
    新华社12日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部出版的“解放军报”今天发表社论，号召解放军军官们在春节不买肉类、少买年货，把肉类和年货让给人民，让给士兵。
    社论首先概述了当前我国市场上的繁荣景象，指出由于人民生活水平的迅速提高、购买力的增长而引起的某些副食品不够宽裕的情况，肉类供应又是副食品供应中一个比较突出的困难。这种困难情况以及另外一些物品的供应情况，在春节期间必将显得更加紧张。
    社论说，党和政府正在以极大的注意力来解决这个问题。我们军队、尤其是军官们应该热情地帮助政府做好这个工作。社论号召军官们要学习有些地方的政府干部已经决定在春节不买肉类、少买年货，把肉类和年货让给部队官兵和人民群众的精神。军官们应该把肉类和年货让给人民、让给士兵。
      “解放军报”的社论最后还号召军官和士兵们要永远保持和人民同甘共苦的传统作风。
