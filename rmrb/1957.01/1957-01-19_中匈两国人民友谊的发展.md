The joint statement issued on the 17th following the talks between the Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai and the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government clearly points out that the Chinese and Hungarian governments have a completely identical understanding of the Hungarian situation and the current international situation. The Chinese people are following the Hungarian people, who have suffered from the October counter-revolutionary riots, with great concern and sympathy, and fully support the efforts of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government to restore political, economic, and social order.

China and Hungary are both members of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. Although our two countries are thousands of miles apart, the common ideals and goals of the socialist cause closely link us together. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Hungary in October 1949, the relations between the two countries have become increasingly close with the development of socialist construction in both countries.

In the past few years, China and Hungary have always cooperated closely and supported each other in the struggle to ease international tensions. The Hungarian people have consistently supported the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Chinese people in the United Nations and the struggle to restore sovereignty over Taiwan. The Chinese people have also actively supported the Hungarian and Eastern European People's Democratic countries in their struggle to establish European collective security and oppose the arming of West Germany.

Leaders of the Chinese and Hungarian governments have made some friendly visits. Vice Chairman Zhu De visited Hungary in 1956. In the same year, Comrade Kádár also came to China to attend the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Recently, Premier Zhou Enlai visited Hungary. All these friendly visits have shown that the friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people is being consolidated and strengthened. The increasingly close fraternal relations between China and Hungary are an important factor in strengthening the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

The friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people is not only manifested in political and diplomatic mutual support, but also in the increasing development of economic cooperation and cultural exchanges between the two countries.

In recent years, China-Hungary economic relations have developed greatly, which is prominently manifested in the development of China-Hungary trade relations. As early as 1951, China and Hungary signed a trade agreement, and the trade volume has been increasing year by year. The total trade volume in 1956 increased by 20.3% compared with 1951. With the development of trade, the quantity and scope of goods supplied by both parties have also been greatly expanded. In 1951, most of the goods exported by Hungary to China were textiles and consumer goods, while in 1956 they were mainly industrial products, such as agricultural machinery, telecommunications equipment, precision instruments, power generation equipment, and vehicles. The import of these industrial products helped China's socialist industrialization. In the past few years, China has also exported various raw materials to Hungary, which has also met, to a certain extent, the needs of Hungary's economic development and improvement of people's living standards. This equal and mutually beneficial trade relationship has promoted the common prosperity of the Chinese and Hungarian economies.

China-Hungary scientific and technological cooperation has also played a great role in the socialist construction of the two countries. Since 1953, China and Hungary have signed scientific and technological cooperation agreements and established the China-Hungary Joint Committee for Scientific and Technological Cooperation. According to the agreement, Hungary has obtained China's technical assistance in agriculture and light industry, and China has also obtained Hungary's technical assistance in the manufacture of refrigeration equipment and telecommunications equipment. In 1956, the Joint Committee for Scientific and Technological Cooperation signed a new protocol, increasing the technical assistance provided by both parties from 30 to 69 items, of which China requested 56 items of technical assistance from Hungary. In addition to providing technical assistance to China in agriculture and light industry, Hungary has given China scientific and technological assistance, especially in geophysical exploration. China has also sent interns to Hungary to study advanced textile technology. Currently, Hungarian experts and technical personnel are helping China to explore for oil.

In addition, Hungary has also held various technical exhibitions in China, such as the textile testing instrument exhibition and the mineral exploration equipment exhibition. These exhibitions have provided Chinese scientists and technicians with good opportunities to observe and learn Hungary's advanced industrial technology.

In order to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people, the Hungarian government helped China establish the China-Hungary Friendship Agricultural Machinery and Tractor Station in Ziyang County, Shandong Province, in 1955. The Hungarian government not only donated more than 200 complete sets of agricultural machinery equipment needed for China's agricultural machinery station, but also sent its outstanding agricultural managers and technicians to help us work.

With the strengthening of China-Hungary economic ties, cultural exchanges between the two countries have also been expanding. In recent years, the two countries have sent various delegations to visit each other, hold various exhibitions, film weeks, and exchange books and publications. These activities have played a very good role in promoting mutual understanding between the two peoples and communicating the thoughts and feelings of the two peoples. The Hungarian National People's Art Troupe visited China in 1952, and the Hungarian People's Army Art Troupe came to China again last year to perform. During the nearly three-month visit and performance, they visited twelve major cities in China and performed one hundred shows, with an audience of 200,000 people. The moving art of the Hungarian people left a very deep impression on the Chinese people. The performance of the Chinese art troupe in Hungary also introduced the ancient Chinese national art to the Hungarian people.

When the "Exhibition of the Hungarian People's Republic" was exhibited in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou in 1953, it attracted 2.25 million visitors, which not only gave the Chinese people the opportunity to understand the Hungarian People's Republic, but also enhanced the Chinese people's confidence in the construction of their motherland. The "New China Exhibition" held by China in Hungary in 1951 also achieved the same results. This exhibition attracted 300,000 visitors in one month. Except for the Soviet Art Exhibition, no exhibition in Hungary has been able to attract so many visitors.

In recent years, scientists from China and Hungary have also established close ties. They have sent scientific delegations to visit each other and exchange their advanced experiences. The exchange of students between the two countries began in 1950. The two countries also frequently exchange books and scientific and cultural materials. The works of Sándor Petőfi, the greatest poet and 19th-century revolutionary in Hungary, have been widely distributed in China. Some classical and modern writers from Hungary have also been translated and published in Chinese. Similarly, excellent works of Chinese classical literature and modern literature are also loved by readers in Hungary. Shi Nai'an's novels and the works of modern Chinese writers such as Zhou Libo and Zhao Shuli have helped the Hungarian people to increase their understanding of the past and present life and struggle of the Chinese people.

In terms of broadcasting cooperation and the exchange of experience between athletes, China has also benefited a lot from Hungary.

There is no doubt that all these facts show that the ties between the Chinese and Hungarian people are being strengthened, and the friendship between the two peoples is deepening. The increasing cooperation between the Chinese and Hungarian people in political, economic, and cultural fields will further strengthen the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

China and Hungary will always help each other and advance together on the road of peace and socialist development.

    中匈两国人民友谊的发展
    刘竞
    以周恩来总理为首的中国政府代表团与匈牙利工农革命政府会谈后已于17日发表了联合声明，声明清楚地指出，中匈两国政府对匈牙利局势和目前国际局势的认识完全一致，中国人民以十分关切和同情的心情关怀着遭受十月反革命暴乱的匈牙利人民，并全力支持匈牙利工农革命政府在目前为恢复政治、经济和社会秩序正常而作的努力。
    中匈两国都是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的一员，虽然我们两国相距万里，但为社会主义事业的共同理想和共同目标却把我们紧紧地联系在一起。自1949年10月中匈建交以来，中匈两国的关系随着两国社会主义建设事业的发展愈来愈密切了。
    几年来，中匈两国在为缓和国际紧张局势的斗争中总是紧密合作与相互支持，匈牙利人民一贯支持恢复中国人民在联合国的合法地位和恢复对台湾主权的斗争，中国人民也积极支持匈牙利和东欧人民民主国家人民为建立欧洲集体安全和反对武装西德的斗争。
    中匈两国政府领导人之间进行了一些友好的访问，1956年朱德副主席曾访问了匈牙利，同年，卡达尔同志也来我国参加中国共产党第八次代表大会，最近周恩来总理访问匈牙利，所有这些友好的访问都表明了中匈两国人民的友谊在日益巩固和加强。中匈两国兄弟关系的日益密切，对加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量是一个重要的因素。
    中匈两国人民的友谊不仅表现在政治、外交上的相互支援，而且也表现在两国经济合作和文化交流的日益发展方面。
    几年来，中匈经济关系有了很大发展，突出地表现在中匈贸易关系的发展上。早在1951年我国就和匈牙利签订了贸易协定，而且贸易额在逐年增加。1956年全年的贸易总额比1951年增加了20.3％。随着贸易的发展，双方供应货物的数量与范围亦大为扩大。1951年，匈牙利向我国输出的货物中大部分是纺织品和消费品，而1956年则主要是工业产品，如农业机械、电讯设备、精密仪器、发电设备以及车辆等。这些工业品的输入，帮助了我国社会主义工业化的建设。在过去几年中，我国也对匈牙利输出了各种原料，在一定程度上也满足了匈牙利发展国民经济和提高人民生活水平的需要。这种平等互利的贸易关系促进了中匈两国经济的共同高涨。
    中匈两国的科学技术合作也对两国的社会主义建设起了很大的作用。从1953年起，中匈两国就签订了科学技术合作协定并成立了中匈科学和技术合作联合委员会。根据协定，匈牙利在农业和轻工业方面取得了我国的技术援助，我国在冷藏设备和电讯器材制造业方面也取得匈牙利的技术援助。1956年，科学技术合作联合委员会又签订了新的议定书，双方提供的技术援助，从三十项增加到六十九项，其中我国向匈牙利提出的技术援助要求占五十六项。匈牙利除在农业和轻工业方面对我国进行技术援助外，特别在地球物理勘探方面给予我国以科学技术援助。我国又选派了实习生到匈牙利去学习先进的纺织技术。目前，匈牙利专家和技术工作人员正在帮助我国进行勘探石油。
    此外，匈牙利也在我国举办了各种技术展览会，如纺织试验仪器展览会，探矿设备展览会，这些展览会给我国科学家和技术人员提供了观摩和学习匈牙利先进的工业技术的良好机会。
    为了加强中匈两国人民的友谊，匈牙利政府曾在1955年在我国山东省滋阳县帮助我国建立了中匈友谊农业机器拖拉机站。匈牙利政府不仅赠送给我国农业机器站所需要的二百余件全套农业机器设备，并派遣了自己优秀的农业管理人员和技术人员来帮助我们工作。
    随着中匈经济联系的加强，两国的文化交流也日益扩大。几年来，两国曾互派了各种代表团进行相互访问，举办各种展览会，相互举办了电影周和交换了书籍出版物等。这些工作在促进两国人民的相互了解和沟通两国人民的思想感情起了十分良好的作用。1952年匈牙利国家人民文工团曾访问了我国，去年匈牙利人民军文工团又来我国演出，在将近三个月的访问演出中，曾访问了我国十二个大城市，演出了一百场，观众达二十万人。匈牙利人民的动人的艺术，给中国人民留下了极为深刻的印象。中国艺术团在匈牙利的演出，也把中国古老的民族艺术介绍给了匈牙利人民。
    1953年，“匈牙利人民共和国展览会”在北京、上海、广州三地展出的时候，观众达二百二十五万人，这不仅使我国人民有机会认识匈牙利人民共和国，而且也增强了我国人民对自己祖国建设的信心。1951年，我国在匈牙利举办的“新中国展览会”也取得了同样的成绩。这次展览会在一个月内参观者达三十万人。除苏联美术展览会外，在匈牙利没有任何展览会能够吸引这么多观众的。
    几年来，中匈两国的科学家也建立了亲密的联系。互派科学代表团访问并交流各自的先进经验。两国交换留学生的工作，从1950年就已开始。两国也经常进行书籍和科学文化资料的相互交换。匈牙利最伟大的诗人、十九世纪革命家山陀尔·裴多菲他的作品在我国得到了大量的发行。匈牙利的一些古典和现代作家的作品也被译成中文出版。同样，中国古典文学和现代文学的优秀作品在匈牙利也受到读者的喜爱。施耐庵的小说、周立波、赵树理等现代中国作家的作品使匈牙利人民增进了对中国人民的过去和现在的生活和斗争的了解。
    在广播合作和两国运动员的经验交流方面我国也从匈牙利方面取得了不少的教益。
    毫无疑问，所有这些事实都说明了中匈两国人民的联系在日益加强，两国人民的友谊在日益加深。中匈两国人民在政治、经济和文化方面的合作的日益加强，将进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量。
    中匈两国在和平和社会主义发展的道路上，将永远互相帮助和共同前进。
