    Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Products Procurement Bureau Decides to Purchase Over 920,000 Dan of Cotton Stalk Bark
    (Our Newspaper) The Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Products Procurement Bureau recently decided to purchase over 920,000 dan of cotton stalk bark throughout the province. To ensure the realization of this plan, the bureau has instructed procurement units in various localities to seize the time to carry out purchases, and has printed and distributed more than 20,000 copies of materials such as "Cotton Stalk Bark Peeling and Degumming Methods" to guide farmers in peeling. At the same time, it has also appropriately increased the purchase price of cotton stalk bark. This item alone will increase the income of farmers throughout the province by 500,000 yuan. Currently, under the specific guidance of procurement departments, farmers in various places are actively carrying out the work of peeling cotton stalk bark. For example, more than 300 semi-laborers in the Nongjian Society of Chengxiang Township, Siyang County, peeled more than 9,000 jin of cotton stalk bark in just five days. (Bian Mi)

    江苏省农产品采购厅决定收购棉杆皮九十二万多担
    本报讯　江苏省农产品采购厅，最近决定在全省收购棉杆皮九十二万多担。为了保证这一计划的实现，这个厅已指示各地所属采购单位抓紧进行收购，并印发了两万多份“棉杆皮剥制与脱胶方法”等材料，以指导农民进行剥制。同时，还适当地提高了棉杆皮的收购价格。仅这一项，即将使全省农民增加五十万元的收入。目前，各地农民正在采购部门的具体指导下，积极展开剥制棉杆皮的工作。如泗阳县城厢乡农建社的三百多个半劳动力，在短短五天中，就剥制出棉杆皮九千多斤。　　　（卞米）
