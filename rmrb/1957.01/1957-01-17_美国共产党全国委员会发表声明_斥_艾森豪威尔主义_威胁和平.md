    Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 15th (TASS): The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States of America issued a statement to the press, emphasizing that the so-called "Eisenhower-Dulles Doctrine" is a threat to peace and is causing increasing anxiety among the American people.

    The statement said that the essence of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is to request Congress to approve Wall Street's plan to play the role that Britain and France played in the Middle East in the past. This plan advocates squeezing out the competitors of American oil companies—Britain and France—in the Middle East, and using American soldiers and dollars to stop the national independence movements of Arab countries. Therefore, this plan is a threat to peace.

    The National Committee of the Communist Party called on trade unions and other mass organizations to stop launching the "Cold War."

    美国共产党全国委员会发表声明
    斥“艾森豪威尔主义”威胁和平
    新华社16日讯　塔斯社纽约15日讯：美国共产党全国委员会向报界发表一项声明，声明强调指出，所谓“艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯主义”就是对和平的威胁，并且引起美国人民愈来愈强烈的不安。
    声明说，“艾森豪威尔主义”实质上是要求国会批准华尔街想扮演过去英、法在中东扮演过的角色的计划。这个计划主张在中东排挤美国石油公司的竞争者——英国和法国，并且用美国士兵和美元来阻止阿拉伯国家的民族独立运动。因此，这个计划是对和平的威胁。
    共产党全国委员会号召工会和其他群众团体制止发动“冷战”。
