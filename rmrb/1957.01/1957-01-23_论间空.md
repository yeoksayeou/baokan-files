    On Interspace
    Chen Mengjia
    Interspace, or blank space, is an excellent method in Chinese artistic practice. It occupies a very important position in our artistic tradition. Ancient works of art, between the elaborate and the simple, have a kind that we call the moderate style, that is, with some ornamentation but leaving most of the space blank. These blank spaces are not just blank; they themselves are undecorated decorations, a kind of unspoken speech. This is the meaning of what the ancients called "music beyond the strings," or "implication." Opposed to interspace, the good is exquisite elaboration, completeness, and fullness, etc., while the bad is crowding and piling up, etc. A beautiful work, fully expressing its beauty and yet allowing people to appreciate it leisurely in a relaxed atmosphere, requires interspace.
    In Chinese works of art, there are various methods to use interspace. Freehand brushwork paintings with a few light strokes of ink leave a lot of blank space; a simple Ming Dynasty zither table is plain all over, with only a few slightly decorated "teeth"; a plain bronze vessel has only three small crouching beasts cast on the lid. This places most of the interspace within the entire artistic design. The mounting of books and calligraphy, apart from the engraved characters and the calligraphy itself, leaves a large "heaven and earth head," which makes even a full landscape or a tedious textual research look less tense (the heaven and earth head also has practical significance, allowing for annotations and corrections in books, and poems and inscriptions on calligraphy). This is interspace used for setting off. I am now sitting on a Ming Dynasty Huanghuali chair, the upper back of which is carved with elaborate images, while the lower legs are all plain, with only a small carved flower. This uses a portion of interspace to harmonize or dilute another portion of elaboration. The famous Wang's Charitable Estate rockery in Suzhou City, said to be made in the Ming Dynasty: the mountain is small but winding with strange interest, with large trees and small bridges, and in a few square feet of land, it seems to have a different world. This uses clever arrangement to artificially expand the limited space.
    When we look at mountain scenery in the wild or see a solitary island in the sea, in this natural picture, the sky and earth or the sky and water make a large heaven and earth head, which broadens our minds. People's vision needs some open large frames. In the freehand brushwork or flower paintings made by past literati, the blank background not only makes what is painted more prominent but also gives people room for free imagination in the blank space. This measure is different from Western oil paintings, which use color to smear the entire screen and only frame it with a narrow, gorgeous wooden frame.
    Local operas without sets or with only simple furnishings also dilute the background and focus the audience's attention on the actors, with the actors' actions suggesting the existence of houses, courtyards, and mountains. There is nothing wrong with this. A good actor can create the background more freely in his performance, better than those painted. This is a valuable point in our traditional art, but some self-righteous reformers insist on using stupid methods to create full-scale sets, which seems unnecessary.
    From the Book of Songs to the Tang Dynasty's quatrains and the Song Dynasty's lyrics, it is always a short set of words that expresses the scene and feelings, making us feel that the words are simple but the meaning is long, and we never tire of reading them after thousands of years. Literary works, especially poetry, the shortness in form is precisely where it is not short. The ancients did not divide lines when writing poems, so one or two lines could be a poem or lyric. We now divide lines, which makes it look clear, but it takes up more space to print. I have always felt that emotions and meanings can be long, deep, or tortuous, but the way of expressing them is better to be concise. If we write long things short, it will only be good and not bad; if we write short things long, we cannot avoid being annoying. Now the poems divided into lines are printed on paper, already having blank space, and I think it would be even better if the writers left more blank space.
    One of the most lovely things about Beijing is that it has many parks, and the parks have many open spaces, and the open spaces have many teahouses. Unfortunately, we can only go on Sundays. The purpose of going is to find an open space to walk a few steps, and sit down and brew a pot of tea even if we are not thirsty. Today, we are very busy with work and study, and parks are the best place to take a breather.
    The advantage of Beijing's courtyard houses is that there is a courtyard in the center of the four sides. The courtyard is not necessarily a place for walking, but having a courtyard makes you feel like you have a small open space, not so tight. The disadvantage of courtyard houses is that they are one-story buildings, taking up a lot of land; however, high-rise apartments lack that courtyard, which is a flaw. Nowadays, there are many people and crowded houses, and some people have both furniture and books, so houses are considered small rather than large. This is something that cannot be helped, but there are also ways to remedy it. I think the most effective way is to put everything against the wall, leaving a space (even if it is very small) in the middle of the room, so that even in a small room, you still feel like you have some room to spare.
    Of course, we cannot ask today's cities and homes to have as much blank space as ancient paintings, but we can squeeze out some room. The busyness of our work today is unavoidable, and this busyness and heaviness are for tomorrow. In my personal experience, I can still create things even in the midst of busyness, and what is forced out in busyness is sometimes better than what comes slowly in leisure. The reason for this is that the acceleration of work allows us to contact many "faces" in a short period of time, and we can quickly absorb some essence from them. The human brain also needs to be exercised, the more it is sharpened, the faster it becomes. However, there is also a certain limit, just like a train needs to rest after a long journey, the brain needs to rest very much. Not allowing a big rest, we still have to steal leisure from busyness, and there are ways to do this. My personal method is to watch a play, which can keep the brain from moving and appreciate art. As such an audience, we hope that the play is not too rigid. I think many viewers hope to have a few hours of free time to watch a play.
    Today, we are creating an unprecedented new China, and we must accelerate the speed of our life and work, and we must also use and develop the geographical, academic, and cultural interspace to enrich them. Of course, we cannot allow many people to have a lot of leisure, or for the land to have a lot of barren blank space. I think this will never happen. Precisely because of this, our life today must be fast-paced, and it must reduce the blank space of space, so we need to consider our work and life arrangements in this situation: squeeze out a little blank space in time and space. Just like in long-distance running, we must arrange short periods of rest, like knowing how to float for a while when swimming across the Yangtze River.

    论间空
    陈梦家
    间空或空白，是中国艺术实践中一个很好的方法。它在我们艺术的传统中，占据了很重要的位置。古代艺术作品，介乎繁缛式与简朴式之间的，有一种我们称为中庸式的，就是有一部分文饰而留出多半的空白。这些空白也并非只是空白而已，它们本身是不装饰的装饰，一种无言之言。古人所谓弦外之音，所谓涵蓄，就是这种意思。和间空相对待的：好的是精美的繁缛、完满和充实等等，坏的是拥挤与堆砌等等。一件美的作品，充量的表现其美而又使人能在悠闲的气氛下去从容欣赏，就需要间空。
    在中国的艺术作品中，有种种不同方法来运用间空的。轻描淡写的少数几笔墨色的写意画，留出很多的空白；一张简朴的明代琴桌全身是素的，只是几个略带文饰的“牙”；一个素的铜器只在盖上铸上小小三个伏兽。这是把大部分的间空打在整个美术设计以内。书本和书画的装裱，在所刻文字和所作书画本身以外，留出很大的“天地头”，这样既使一幅满满的山水或一篇繁琐的考证，看起来比较不紧张一点（天地头也有实用的意义，在书本上可以作批注校记，在书画上可以诗跋题记）。这种是用衬托的间空。我现在坐的是一张明代黄花梨椅子，其上部的背雕出了繁缛的许多图象，而下部的足全是素的，只有一小朵雕花。这种是用一部分的间空来调和或冲淡另一部分繁缛。苏州城内有名的汪氏义庄的假山，传说是明代的制作：山很小而屈折有奇趣，有大树小桥，而在数方丈之地仿佛别有天地。这种是用巧妙的布置使有限的空间人为的有扩大的感觉。
    我们在野外远眺山景或在海中看孤岛，在此天然的图画之中，天和地或天和水做了很大的天地头，使我们胸襟为之开朗。人们的眼界是需要一些空阔的大框子的。在过去文人所作的写意画或花卉画，空白的背景不但使所画的更显著起来，并且给人以在空白上有自由想像的余地。这种措施和西洋油画是不同的，后者用颜色涂抹了整个画面而只镶了窄窄一个华丽的木框。
    没有布景或只有简单陈设的地方戏，也是冲淡了背景而使观众的视线只注意到演员，而由演员的动作暗示出房屋、庭院、山野的存在。这也没有什么不好的地方。一个好演员，可以在他的演作上更自由地创造出背景来，比那些画好的更好。这本是我们传统艺术中很可宝贵的一点，而近来有些自作聪明的改革家一定要用愚笨的法子制造全幅的布景，似乎大可不必。
    从诗经到唐人的绝句、宋人的词，总是短短的一组字，表现了情景和感兴，使我们在千载以后，诵吟之际觉其语简而意长，百读不厌。文学作品，尤其是诗，形式上的短正是它不短的地方。古人写诗并不分行，所以可以一行、二行便是一首诗词。我们现在分行了，看起来清楚明白，印起来却多占地位。我向来觉得情感意义可以长、深或曲折，但表现的方式还是精简一点好。我们若是把长的写短了，只会好不会坏的；把短的写长了，不免于可厌。现在分行的诗印在纸上，已经有了空白，我想写的人更多留一点空白，一定会更好的。
    北京城最可爱之一，是它有许多公园，公园内有许多空地，空地上有许多茶座。可惜的是，我们只能星期日去。去的目的是找一空旷之地散行几步，坐下来并不渴而泡一壶茶。我们今天，工作和学习非常紧张，公园正是最好的可以松一口气的地方。
    北京住家的四合院，好处就在四合之中有一块院子。院子本不一定是散步所在，但有了院子就觉得有一块小小空地，不怎么紧。四合院的坏处就是一层平房，占地大；然而高楼的公寓却缺少那一个院子，美中不足。现在人多而房挤，有些人又有家具又有书，房子不嫌大而嫌小。这本是无可奈何之事，但亦有补救之道。我想最有效的办法是把一切东西靠墙，无论如何留出房间当中一块（那怕是很小一块）空地，那样即使你在小小斗室之中，还觉得有些余地。
    我们当然不能要求今天的都市和住家像古画一样有许多空白，但是可以挤出一些余地的。我们今天工作的繁忙是不能避免的，这些繁忙与沉重是为了明天。以我个人的经历来说，在百忙之中还是可以做出东西来的，忙中逼出来的有时比闲中缓缓而来的还好。这原因，就是工作的加速度使我们短期中接触了许多“面”，可以加快地从中吸取一些菁华。人类的脑子也需要锻炼，越磨越快利。但是，也有一定的限度，好像火车在长途之后也需要休息一样，脑子很需要休息。不容许大大的休息，我们还得忙中偷闲，这是有办法的。我个人的办法，是看戏，可以使脑子不动，欣赏艺术。作为一个这样的观众，我们希望戏比较不要太刻板。我想许多的观众是希望有几小时的空闲而去看戏的。
    我们今天正在创造一个史无前例的新中国，必须加快我们生活和工作的速度，也必须利用和开发地利的和学术文化的空白，充实他们。当然不允许许多人有许多的闲空，或者土地上有许多荒芜的空白。我想，这也绝不会有的。就因为如此，我们今天的生活一定是快速度的，一定是减少空间的空白的，我们才有必要在这样的情形之下考虑一下自己的工作和生活的安排：在时间上和空间上挤出一点空白。正如同在长距离的运动中一定要安排下短时间的休息，好像横渡长江的游泳当中要知道飘浮一阵的方法。
