Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, January 2nd: Guangxi Province's work of rectifying agricultural cooperatives has been gradually unfolding throughout the province. The main focus of this rectification work is to examine and summarize the experiences and lessons learned in production and cooperative management over the past year of 1956, to reverse the negative sentiments among cadres and members after the criticism of subjectivism, to draw clear lines between right and wrong, to unify ideological understanding, and to prepare for this year's great production.

Guangxi Province achieved advanced agricultural collectivization in the spring of 1956. The advanced agricultural cooperatives throughout the province have demonstrated great superiority in production over the past year. Despite suffering from a severe drought in the second half of the year, the worst in decades, the province's total annual grain output still reached 10.6 billion jin, maintaining a normal harvest. However, in the first half of 1956, leadership departments, in guiding production, neglected sideline production and demanded excessive and rigid grain production targets, which led rural cadres to adopt coercive and commanding styles in promoting increased production measures and technological reforms. This subjectivism on the part of the leadership and the coercive and commanding styles of rural cadres were criticized in the second half of the year and were largely overcome. However, in the process of opposing subjectivism, due to the unclear demarcation between right and wrong, many people, after opposing rashness, became hesitant and indecisive; after opposing coercion and commandism, they became cautious and timid. For example, after opposing unrealistic production targets, they dared not set any more targets; after opposing coercion in technological reforms, they reverted to the old ways of farming production. Therefore, many things that could have been done were abandoned. On the part of the commune members, some people saw more of the shortcomings of the agricultural cooperatives and less of the achievements, failing to distinguish between the objective and subjective causes of production decreases and income reductions, and also began to doubt the superiority of the advanced cooperatives.

In response to this situation, in this round of commune rectification, all localities first solved the ideological problems of the commune members. Rong County, a severely drought-affected area, and Yongning and Yishan areas in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, in order to help commune members understand whether agricultural cooperatives were truly superior, helped commune members calculate six detailed accounts. These were the accounts of increased production and income, the accounts of basic construction and household income within the commune, the accounts of technological improvement and collective disaster resistance, the accounts of avoiding polarization, the accounts of unified management and enhanced unity, and the accounts of state support. The facts of the calculations proved that, even in a severe drought, more than 60% of the agricultural cooperatives in these areas achieved increased production, and less than 30% of the communes experienced reduced production and income. The general agricultural and sideline production equipment within the communes has greatly increased compared to the past. In terms of water conservancy construction and afforestation, many things that were impossible in the past are now being done. Because the advanced cooperatives implemented unified management and payment according to labor, the ethnic disputes and clan disagreements that had been left over from many generations within the peasantry have been greatly eliminated. When Shizhai District's fifteen communes in Rong County and Dalu Commune in Yulin County calculated the detailed account of avoiding polarization, many "five guarantee" households, impoverished households, and poor peasant commune members believed that if there had not been a high tide of cooperativization in the spring, in the face of such a great drought, it was unknown how many families would have been bankrupted and fallen into distress, with wives and children scattered.

In addition, in this round of commune rectification, all localities also focused on protecting the enthusiasm of cadres, clarifying the scope of responsibility for past mistakes. The leadership departments generally conducted self-criticism for the responsibilities that should be borne by the leadership. In the commune rectification in Wucun, Pingshan, Xirang, and Pingdishan townships in Beiliu County, the local Party committee work teams helped commune cadres and commune members lay out the facts and repeatedly analyze them, clarifying the lines between right and wrong step by step. The enthusiasm of commune cadres and commune members immediately increased, and their confidence also improved. Several advanced communes, such as Xirang and Pingshan, also launched rationalization proposals and initially formulated a plan for the comprehensive development of agricultural and sideline production in 1957.

    总结办社成绩和经验教训　为今年的大生产作好准备
    广西在整社中保护干部的积极性
    新华社南宁2日电　广西省整顿农业社的工作，已在全省范围内逐步展开。这次整社工作，主要是检查总结1956年一年来在生产和办社中的经验教训，扭转在批判主观主义以后在干部和社员中产生的消极情绪，划清是非界限，统一思想认识，为今年的大生产作好准备工作。
    广西省在1956年春季就实现了高级农业合作化，全省的高级农业社在一年来的生产中显示了很大的优越性，在下半年遭受了几十年来所未有的严重旱灾的情况下，全省全年的粮食产量仍然达到了一百零六亿斤，保持了平常的年景。但是，1956年上半年领导部门在领导生产的工作中，忽视了副业生产，对粮食增产要求过急，生产计划指标订得过高过死，这便促使农村干部在推行增产措施和技术改革上发生了强迫命令作风。领导上的这种主观主义和农村干部的强迫命令作风在下半年受到了批判，并且有了很大程度的克服。但是，在反对主观主义过程中，由于是非界限划得不清，不少人在反对了急躁情绪以后，转为迟疑不前；反对强迫命令以后转为谨小慎微。例如反对了脱离实际的生产计划指标后，就不敢再制定计划指标；反对了技术改革上的强迫命令，就回过头来按农民固有的老规矩耕作生产。因此，有很多本来可以办到的事，也放弃不办了。在社员群众方面，有一部分人对农业社的缺点看得多，成绩看得少，分不清减产和减收的客观和主观原因，对高级社的优越性也发生了怀疑。
    针对这种情况，在这次整社工作中各地都首先解决社员的思想问题。受旱比较严重的容县专区和桂西僮族自治州邕宁、宜山等地区，为了让社员认识农业社到底有没有优越性的问题，都帮助社员算了六笔细账。这就是算增产增收账、社内基本建设和家庭账、技术提高和集体抗灾账、算避免两极分化账、统一经营增强团结账和国家支援账。算账的事实证明，在严重旱灾里这些地区还有60％以上的农业社获得增产，减产减收社不到30％。一般的社内农副业生产设备都比过去大大增加。在水利建设和造林工作上，很多过去根本办不到的事，如今都办到了。由于高级社实行统一经营和按劳取酬，农民内部多年多代遗留下来的民族纠纷和宗派不和，都大大消除了。容县石寨区十五个社和玉林县大路社在算到避免两极分化这笔细账时，很多“五保”户、困难户和贫农社员都认为，要不是春天有个合作化高潮，遇到这样大旱年头，不知要有多少家破产落坑、妻离子散。
    此外，各地在整社中，也从保护干部积极性着眼，划清了对过去所犯错误的责任范围，应由领导部门负责的，领导上一般都进行了检讨。北流县梧村、平山、西壤和平地山等四个乡在整社中，当地党委工作组帮助社干部和社员群众摆事实和反复分析，逐次划清了是非界限，社干部和社员的劲头顿时增强，信心也提高了。西壤、平山等几个高级社还开展合理化建议，初步制定了1957年农副业生产全面发展的规划。
