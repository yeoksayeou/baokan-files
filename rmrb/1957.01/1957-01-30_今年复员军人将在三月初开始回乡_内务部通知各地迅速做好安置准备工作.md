Xinhua News Agency, January 29th. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the People's Republic of China recently requested that the People's Committees and their Civil Affairs Departments/Bureaus of all provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities prepare for the reception and resettlement of demobilized soldiers in 1957, so that the demobilized soldiers returning home this year will feel the government's concern and the warmth of their hometown.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs said in a recent notice issued to all localities that this year's demobilized soldiers will begin returning home in early March. Therefore, before and after the Spring Festival, all localities should first quickly restore the working offices of the Transfer to Civilian Work Committees and the original transfer stations and reception stations, strengthen the staff, strengthen leadership, and conscientiously do a good job of receiving the demobilized soldiers passing through. Before the demobilized soldiers return home, local governments should first understand the production and living conditions of their families, and educate grassroots cadres and demobilized soldiers to strengthen unity, care for and help demobilized soldiers solve difficulties in production and building their homes.

The notice pointed out that after the demobilized soldiers arrive in the special districts and counties, leading cadres should personally preside over welcome meetings to introduce to them the local agricultural production and rural work conditions, and especially explain the actual difficulties and existing problems in current rural life. Encourage them to model themselves in abiding by national policies and laws, share weal and woe with the people, and actively participate in agricultural production. Village cadres and the masses should also warmly welcome the demobilized soldiers and help them arrange production and living.

The notice also required all localities to strive to seize the time to resolve the remaining issues in past resettlement work before this year's demobilized soldiers return home.
