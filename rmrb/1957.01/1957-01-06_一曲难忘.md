    An Unforgettable Song
    Liu Xue'an
    Soviet People's Artist, Stalin Prize laureate, bass singer Boris Romanovich Gmyrya and pianist Lev Osterin, his accompanist, held a solo concert in Beijing on December 18, 1956, during their visit to China. The program was divided into two parts, a total of sixteen songs. The first part, from Ukrainian folk songs to art songs and opera excerpts by famous Russian composers Rubinstein, Dargomyzhsky, Rachmaninoff, Mussorgsky, etc., not only showcased the excellent traditions of Russian classical music, but also demonstrated the strong folk character of the singer's hometown, the Ukrainian region. The second part featured excellent works of Western European classics, including opera excerpts by Italian composers Verdi and Rossini, art songs by German composers Massenet, Schubert, and Schumann, and popular opera excerpts by Mozart. At the enthusiastic request of the audience, two more Russian folk songs were added at the end.
    The entire solo concert conveyed the thoughts and feelings of different eras, nations, countries, and composers through the highly professional skills and profound expressive techniques of the singer and accompanist, using authentic, beautiful, and richly colored musical images, accurately and completely displayed, deeply infecting the audience.
    The singer's performance of the first part of the songs: the folk song "The Roar of the Dnieper" was sung so kindly and beautifully; from a relatively loud to an increasingly light and clear sound, it quickly led people into the beautiful and quiet scenery of the Ukrainian landscape. In Dargomyzhsky's "Night Breeze," the delicate and exquisite accompaniment, set off by the gentle and sweet singing, fully depicted the charm of the secluded sentiment under the moonlight. "The Song of the Flea" is a program frequently sung by general bass singers, but Gmyrya did not use a hearty satirical image like other singers, but used a light, sarcastic, and slightly mocking way of speaking to unify the musical tone with the language tone; I think he expressed Mussorgsky's original intention more profoundly. Other songs, such as Lysenko's "Ostap's Aria," Rubinstein's "Ballad," Dargomyzhsky's "Old Corporal," and Rachmaninoff's "Aleko's Romance," all meticulously expressed the characters depicted in the songs and their spiritual state. For example, in "Aleko's Romance," when he sang the last line, "And now Zemphira has changed her heart... Zemphira has become indifferent..." although the singing became weaker like weeping, the inner pain was very intense, setting off the exciting ending of the piano accompaniment, maintaining a silent and audible connection with the singer's full emotions, showing the mental state of psychological contradiction to the extreme.
    In the second part of the singing, several opera excerpts: Philip's aria was sung so gloomy and disappointed, Figaro's aria was sung so fluently and playfully, and Don Basilio's aria was sung as if he was in a state of panic all day long. This not only fully revealed the composer's style, but also deeply portrayed the characters' personalities. The performance of several art songs, Massenet's "Elegy" was sung so somber and desolate, Schumann's "I Weep in My Dream" showed a deep affection, so that the content of the two songs and the styles of the two composers were expressed at different heights. Although "Serenade" and "On the Road" are works by the same composer, due to the different specific content of the two works, they also gave the audience different profound feelings.
    I want to say once again that Bo. Luo. Gmyrya's solo concert gave us a very deep impression. This is not only because of his high professional skills and free control of sound expression methods; the most important thing is his realistic singing accomplishment. Through his beautiful singing and piano accompaniment, he faithfully expressed the artistic image that different composers' styles and the content of their works intended to express. This is worth learning from by our vocal workers.

    一曲难忘
    刘雪庵
    苏联人民演员、斯大林奖金获得者、男低音歌唱家鲍里斯·罗曼诺维奇·格梅里亚和伴奏者钢琴家列夫·奥斯特林1956年12月18日在北京举行了访华演出的独唱音乐会。演出节目分两部分，共十六首歌曲。第一部分从乌克兰民歌到俄罗斯的著名作曲家鲁宾什坦、达尔戈梅斯基、拉赫曼尼诺夫、莫索尔斯基等的艺术歌曲及歌剧选曲，不仅表现了俄罗斯古典音乐的优秀传统，同时也表现了歌唱家故乡乌克兰地区极浓烈的民间色彩。第二部分演唱的是西欧的古典优秀作品，包括意大利作曲家威尔第同罗西尼的歌剧选曲，德国玛斯奈、舒伯特、舒曼的艺术歌曲和流行的莫扎特的歌剧选曲。在听众的热烈要求下，最后还加唱了两首俄罗斯民歌。
    整个独唱会的节目把不同时代，不同民族、国家，以及不同作曲家作品的思想感情，通过演唱家及伴奏者以高度的专业技巧和深湛的表现手法，用真实优美、丰富多采的音乐形象，确切而完整地显示出来，深深地感染了在场的听众。
    歌唱家演唱的第一部分歌曲：民歌“第聂伯河的狂叫”唱得是那样亲切优美；从比较响亮到越来越轻彻的声音，很快就把人引到乌克兰锦绣河山那种美丽而安静的胜景中去了。在达尔戈梅斯基的“夜晚的微风”中，细致精美的伴奏衬着温柔甜适的歌声，充分地刻划出月下幽情的趣味。“跳蚤之歌”是一般低音歌唱家经常演唱的节目，但格梅里亚不是像其他歌唱家那样用爽朗的讽笑的形象，而是用一种轻嘲微讽像讲话一样的方式把音乐音调与语言音调统一起来表演的；我觉得他把莫索尔斯基的原意表现得更深刻一些了。其他如雷森科的“奥斯塔伯的咏叹调”、鲁宾什坦的“叙事曲”、达尔戈梅斯基的“老班长”。拉赫曼尼诺夫的“阿列柯的抒情曲”都细致地表现了歌曲中所描绘的人物和他们的精神状态。像“阿列柯的抒情曲”最后唱到“而现在真妃儿变了心……真妃儿冷淡了……”的时候，歌声虽然是若泣若诉地微弱下来，但内在的痛苦却非常厉害，衬着钢琴伴奏激动的尾声，与演唱家丰满的情绪保持着无声与有声间的联系，显示了心理矛盾到极点的精神状态。
    歌唱的第二部分中几首歌剧选曲：费力浦的咏叹调唱得那样阴沉失望，费加罗的咏叹调又唱得这样流利佻达，唐·巴齐里欧的咏叹调却唱得像惶惶不可终日一样，这不仅把作曲家的作品风格充分地揭露出来了，同时把人物的个性也作了深入的刻划。几首艺术歌曲的演唱，玛斯奈的“悲歌”唱得多么沉郁凄凉，舒曼的“我在梦中痛苦”表现的一往情深，使两首歌曲的内容同两个作曲家的风格都得到了不同的高度的表现。“小夜曲”和“上路”虽然是同一作曲家的作品，由于两首作品不同的具体内容，也给了听众不同的深刻的感受。
    我要再一次说，鲍·罗·格梅里亚的独唱会，给我们的印象是十分深刻的。这不仅因为他的高度的专业技巧，控制自如的声音表现方法；最主要的还是他那现实主义的演唱修养。他通过自己优美的歌声和钢琴伴奏，忠实地表现了不同作曲家的风格和作品内容所企图表达的艺术形象。这是值得我们的声乐工作者好好地学习的。
