Title: One Must Not Treat a Party Member's Political Life Carelessly

Expulsion from the Party is the most severe punishment within the Party. Therefore, the Party Constitution stipulates that Party organizations at all levels should maintain a high degree of prudence when deciding on and approving the expulsion of a member, carefully investigate and study the relevant factual materials, and carefully listen to the individual's appeal.

However, some Party organizations seem to have forgotten this provision of the Party Constitution when implementing disciplinary actions against Party members who have made mistakes, adopting an extremely careless attitude. Consider the following facts:

The Party General Branch Committee of the Shenyang Industrial and Agricultural Accelerated Secondary School received a letter reporting that probationary Party member Cui Jianping had concealed his family background and his father's historical issues. Without verifying the veracity of the accusations in this letter, the General Branch Committee used it as the main basis for disciplinary action against Cui Jianping and decided to revoke Cui Jianping's probationary Party membership. After the punishment, Cui Jianping appealed to the Party's Supervisory Committee at a higher level. After investigation, it was proven that Cui Jianping had already explained these issues to the organization when he started working, joined the Youth League, and joined the Party, and had repeatedly filled them out on his registration forms.

According to an inspection by a certain county's Supervisory Committee, a portion of the forty-six cases of excessively severe punishments in the past year were due to the carelessness and subjective assumptions of certain Party organizations or supervisory cadres when discussing cases and writing punishment decisions, which exaggerated the circumstances of the errors, or drew conclusions based on hearsay and unsubstantiated rumors, thus increasing the severity of the punishments. There were even ridiculous cases of mistaken identity. When the county's Supervisory Committee held a meeting to discuss the case of Zhang ××, director of the grain management office, violating policies and retaliating against others, the secretary of the Supervisory Committee remembered that Director Zhang had also made the mistake of smashing the "Dragon Pattern Stele" (an ancient site), and added it to the reporting materials, thus concluding that Zhang ×× "consistently made mistakes" and deciding to expel him from the Party. Later, it was discovered that the person who smashed the "Dragon Pattern Stele" was actually another Director Zhang.

These are already enough to illustrate the problem. Now let's listen to the accusations of Party members who have made mistakes! Some Party members said in their appeals that they were treated as "people addicted to punishment," that there was "no intention to cure the illness and save the person," and that they were "trying to kill people." Indeed, if our Party organizations do not have a high degree of political responsibility for the "patient" when dealing with Party members who have made mistakes, it is difficult to say that they can truly "cure the illness and save the person."

The Party's implementation of discipline against Party members who have made mistakes is a form of education, and therefore must proceed from political concern for comrades and unity with comrades, adhering to the principle of seeking truth from facts and being "both serious and cautious." Disregarding facts and blindly pursuing punitive punishment will only harm comrades and create chaos within the Party.

The Party's discipline is not just about punishing people, but also about protecting people. We must loudly shout to those who abuse Party discipline and trifle with others' "political lives": You have violated Party discipline!

    不能玩忽党员的政治生命
    教帅章
    开除党籍，是党内的最高处分。因此，党章规定：各级党的组织在决定和批准开除党员的党籍的时候，应当保持高度的慎重，认真调查和研究有关的事实材料，仔细听取本人的申诉。
    但是，有的党组织在对犯错误的党员执行纪律处分时，却似乎忘记了党章的这个规定，采取了极端轻率的态度。请看以下事实：
    沈阳市工农速成中学党总支委员会，收到一封检举预备党员崔建平隐瞒家庭成份和父亲历史问题的来信。这个总支委员会没有查对这封检举信所检举的事情是否属实，就把它作为对崔建平执行纪律处分的主要根据，决定取消崔建平的预备党员资格。处分以后，崔建平向上级党的监察委员会提出申诉。经过调查，证明这些问题崔建平早在参加工作、入团、入党时，就向组织作了交代，并且历次都填写在他的登记表上。
    据某县监察委员会检查，在一年来处分过重的四十六起案件中，有一部分案件就是由于某些党组织或监察干部，在讨论案件、写处分决定时的粗心大意、主观推断而夸大了错误情节，或者道听途说、捕风捉影就下结论，以至加重处分的。甚至竟闹出张冠李戴的笑话来。该县监察委员会开会讨论粮食管理所主任张××违反政策和打击报复的案件时，在报批材料之外，监委书记又想起张主任还犯过砸“龙纹碑”（古迹）的错误，也补充进去，因此就认为张××“一贯犯错误”，决定开除他的党籍。后来才发现砸“龙纹碑”的竟是另外一名张主任。
    这些已经够说明问题的了。现在我们再听听犯错误的党员对他们的控诉吧！有的党员在申诉中说他们是“染了处分瘾的人”，“没有治病救人之心”，“要把人整死”。是的，对待犯错误的党员，如果我们的党组织没有对“病人”怀着高度的政治责任感，很难说他们能够真正“治病救人”。
    党对犯错误的党员执行纪律是一种教育，因此必须从政治上关怀同志、团结同志出发，坚持实事求是和“既严肃又谨慎”的原则。不问事实，一味追求处分的惩办主义，结果只能是伤害同志，在党内造成混乱。
    党的纪律绝不只是处分人，同时也是保护人。我们要向那些滥用党的纪律，玩忽别人“政治生命”的人大喝一声：你已经违反了党的纪律！
