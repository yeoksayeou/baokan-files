　　Beware of Locust Plague!
　　Locusts Found Flying Around in Qinshui, Taiyue Newspaper Calls for Locust Eradication
　　[Report from our Yangcheng correspondent] Locusts have been found in Zhanggou and Houmayuan areas of Qinshui County, and are gradually flying around to various places. In order to eliminate locusts and prevent crop damage, the Fourth School District of the county has organized students to carry out locust-swatting propaganda. Teachers lead students to inspect mountains and fields. Wang Keqin, the labor hero of Houmayuan, called on the masses to combine locust-swatting with the rent reduction campaign, and not allow locusts to invade. Now they have organized locust-swatting teams during the rent reduction campaign. Wherever locusts are found, they concentrate their efforts to eliminate them. The Taiyue Xinhua Daily also called on governments, masses, and schools in various places to immediately heighten their vigilance, organize themselves, and prepare for the locust eradication campaign.
