Market Situation Weekly

In the past week, prices in various border regions have been stable, with only grain showing a slight weakness. The average retail price of wheat in Handan on June 2nd was 26 yuan per jin, but it fell to 24 yuan after the 3rd. The price of white flour remained steady at around 40 yuan per jin. In Jincheng, the price of millet per jin was 16.9 yuan on June 2nd, but it fell to 14.6 yuan on the 6th. As for cotton cloth, prices were resistant to rises or falls, but fluctuations were small. The retail price of cotton in Handan (plus market weight) was around 260-270 yuan per jin at the beginning of the month, falling to 240 yuan by the end of the week, but sales were slow. The price of white market cloth remained around 17,000 yuan per bolt, with no significant changes. On June 3rd, the highest price of sea salt in Heze was 50 yuan per jin, and the lowest was 48 yuan. Green salt cost 800 to 1,000 yuan per jin. On the 5th, vegetable oil in Jincheng was 140 yuan per jin, and white sesame was 250 yuan per jin. Recently, the market in various regions has been in a historically slow season. Most merchants are returning to their hometowns to busy themselves with the summer harvest. Therefore, there are not many goods on the market in various regions. For two or three consecutive days in Heze, there were no transactions or quotations for homespun cloth and cotton.

The exchange rates for legal tender and customs gold units have been falling this week. In Handan, the listed price on the 1st was 4.1 yuan of Jibi currency for buying one customs gold unit and 4.5 yuan for selling; 0.17 yuan of Jibi currency for buying one yuan of legal tender and 0.20 yuan for selling. But by the 3rd, the customs gold unit had fallen to a buying price of 3.7 yuan and a selling price of 4.3 yuan. After the 4th, the price of legal tender was 0.185 yuan for buying and 0.215 yuan for selling. The customs gold unit exchange rate did not move. Both had considerable trading volume. The listed price for red gold in Handan was 53,000 yuan per tael. The Jinan Bank alone traded more than 100 taels this week.

    商情一周
    一周以来，边区各地物价稳定，惟粮食稍疲，邯郸小麦每斤的平均零售价，在六月二日是二十六元，到三日以后就跌成二十四元。白面每斤四十元上下没有变动。晋城小米每斤在本月二日是十六元九角，到六日就跌到十四元六角。在棉花布匹方面，价格难有涨落，但波动不大。邯郸棉花每斤（加市秤）零售价月初在二百六七十元上下以至本周末跌到二百四十元，但出售不快。白市布每匹价格也在一万七千元左右，无大变化。本月三日荷泽的海盐每斤最高五十元，最低四十八元。煮青每斤八百元至一千元。五日晋城的植物油每斤一百四十元，白麻每斤二百五十元。最近各地市场是处在历史性的淡月季节，一般商贩正返乡忙于夏收，因此各地货物上市不多，荷泽的土布棉花连续二三天不仅没有成交，而且没有行情。
    本周法币关金行情是处于跌落形势，邯郸的牌价在一日关金一元比冀钞买进四元一角，卖出四元五角，法币一元比冀钞买进一角七分，卖出二角；但到了三日，关金就跌到买进价三元七角，卖出价四元三角；四日以后法币价格买进一角八分五，卖出二角一分五，关金行情没有动，两者成交都不少。赤金价格，邯郸挂牌价每两五万三千元，仅冀南银行一家本周就成交百余两。
