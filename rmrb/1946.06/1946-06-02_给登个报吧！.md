    Get it Published!
    Reporter Wu Xiang
    "I was just about to look for you! My name is Liu Shuchang, and I am a councilor from Xige outside Xingtai city. Please sit down! You'll understand after I tell you! Look, isn't this road pass written for Dou Keqin? This Dou Keqin is a vegetable seller from Huayuan Village, Xige. He lost his road pass and a wallet with 135 yuan in cash when he entered the city. The money isn't much, but a poor vegetable seller can't afford to lose it! He was very anxious when a comrade from the Eighth Route Army, Zhang Ting, came. It turned out that the road pass and wallet were picked up by Comrade Xin Yeyun of the Tenth Regiment Headquarters of our × Brigade. He specifically sent him to find him according to the address on the road pass. Where else in the world would you find such a good army! They didn't want the money they found, and even personally delivered it to the door. They wouldn't even eat a bowl of rice or drink a sip of tea. He couldn't stop him, so he was both happy and angry. He had no choice but to run to me and say, "The policy of our Eighth Route Army is so good, can you think of a way to spread the word!" I agreed and came to the district office. I heard from the comrades in the district that you were here, and I was just about to look for you! It just so happens that you came. Please write a draft quickly and be sure to get it published in the newspaper. You know, the money isn't much, but the matter is really good!”

    给登个报吧！
    记者  吴象
    “我正要去找你呢！我叫刘树昌，是邢台市西阁外的参议员。你坐吧！我说完你就明白啦！你看，这路条上写的不是窦克琴？这个窦克琴是西阁外花园村卖菜的。他进城把路条丢了，还有个钱包，一百三十五块钱钞票。钱不算多，可是一个穷卖菜的可丢不起呀！他正着急，来了个八路同志张挺，原来路条和钱包是咱×旅十团团部辛烨允同志拾到了。特地派他按路条上开的地方找来。天下那有这样好的队伍呀！拾了钱不要，还亲自送上门来，饭不吃一碗，茶不喝一口，他拉也拉不住，真是又喜欢又生气，没有办法，就跑来找我说：“咱八路军政策这样好，你给想个什么办法传传名呀！”我签应了便到区公所来，听区上同志说你来了，正要去找你呢！恰巧你倒又来了。快起个稿吧，千万叫报上登一登。你知道，钱不多，事情可实在好呀！”
