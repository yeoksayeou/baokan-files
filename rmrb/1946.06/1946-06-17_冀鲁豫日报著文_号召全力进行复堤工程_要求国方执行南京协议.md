    Calling for All-Out Effort on Dyke Restoration Project
    Demanding the Kuomintang Implement the Nanjing Agreement
    [This Dispatch from Heze, June 14th] Regarding the Yellow River dyke restoration issue, the Ji-Lu-Yu Daily published an editorial on the 12th titled "All-Out Effort on the Dyke Restoration Project," which began by stating: "The autonomous river negotiations resulted in the Nanjing Agreement. Our representatives Zhao and Wang returned to Heze on the 25th, and the dyke restoration project immediately commenced. Eighteen counties along the river in the entire border region mobilized 210,000 people, actively carrying out a large-scale dyke restoration project. The people of the border region have devoted their full energy and faithfully implemented the Nanjing Agreement. However, the Kuomintang side, regarding the agreement's clear stipulation that 'the materials and labor-related grain needed for the project should be given priority and allocated as quickly as possible,' has so far only transported four trucks, two sets of instruments, and 100 tons of flour. This meager amount is absolutely insufficient to meet the needs of the vast project underway. (The 210,000 people already working on the project require 270 tons of flour per day for labor-related grain alone.) This forces the people of the Liberated Areas to express doubt and anxiety about the extent to which the Kuomintang side is implementing the Nanjing Agreement. We demand that the National Government, UNRRA, and CNRRA transport the materials and labor-related grain needed for the project in a timely and swift manner, and that technical surveying personnel also be dispatched immediately, otherwise the project will be impossible to carry out." The editorial continued by pointing out several points that should be recognized and strived for in the dyke restoration: "First, the people of our entire region should recognize the difficult circumstances under which we are implementing the Nanjing Agreement. The Nanjing Agreement has answered our just demands, and we must strongly urge the National Government, UNRRA, and CNRRA to guarantee the supply of materials. Second, our cadres must actively participate in the river works and dyke construction like the masses, wholeheartedly serve the people of the entire region, be responsible for the lives and property of the seven million people along the river, make detailed plans for the construction project, cherish human and material resources, save labor and materials, and save time, ensuring that the plan is completed within the scheduled time. Third, we must heighten our vigilance and strictly prevent sabotage by special agents, and we must establish necessary sanitation facilities. Fourth, in order to minimize or eliminate the impact on production, it is necessary to organize mutual aid, organize the able-bodied young and middle-aged people who remain at home, and organize large-scale mutual aid in coordination with semi-able-bodied labor. This will ensure that those who go out to work on the river project have no worries and can work with peace of mind. Fifth, there must be dedicated personnel responsible for carrying out necessary mass cultural and recreational activities. At the same time, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the project, there must be meticulous organizational work. Vigorously cultivate activists for dyke repair, launch mass dyke construction competitions between groups, villages, and counties, and commend models to create a large number of dyke construction heroes. Seventh, leading cadres must humbly learn from the masses. People with experience in river works should be invited to provide guidance, and a large number of people with experience in river management among the masses should be absorbed to participate in leadership."

    冀鲁豫日报著文
    号召全力进行复堤工程
    要求国方执行南京协议
    【本报荷泽十四日电】关于黄河复堤问题，冀鲁豫日报十二日以“全力进行复堤工程”为题发表社论，首称：“自治河谈判获致南京协议，我赵、王两代表于二十五日返回荷泽，复堤工程当即动工，全边区沿河十八个县份动员二十一万人，积极进行大规模的复堤工程。边区人民已经用了自己的全副精力，忠实地执行了南京协议，但是国民党方面对协议上明确规定“工程所需之器材、工粮优先尽速供给筹拨”，截至目前为止，只运到汽车四辆、仪器两套、面粉一百吨，如此渺小的数字，是绝对不能适应正在进行中的浩大工程的需要。（已动工的二十一万人仅工粮一项每天即需面粉二百七十吨）这使解放区人民对国民党方面执行南京协议的程度，不得不表示怀疑与焦虑。我们要求国民政府、联总、行总将工程所需之器材、工粮及时迅速运来，技术测量人员亦立即派来，否则会使工程无法进行。继即指出复堤中应认识和努力的几点：“首先，我全区人民应认识到，我们是处在怎样困难的情况下来执行南京协议，南京协议已经答复了我们公正的要求，必须力请国民政府、联总、行总保证物资供给。第二，我们干部要和群众一样积极参加河工筑堤，全心全意为全区人民服务，对沿河七百万人民生命财产负责，对施工程要作详细计划，珍惜人力、物力、节工节料，节省时间。保证在预定时间，完成计划。第三、要提高警惕，严防特务破坏，并要建立必要的卫生设备。第四，为了使生产少受以至不受影响，必需组织互助，组织留在家的青壮年，配合半劳动力组织大互助。使出外作河工的人无后顾之忧，安心工作。第五、要有专人负责开展必要的群众性的文化娱乐工作。同时，为了保证工程的顺利进行，必须要有细密的组织工作。大力培养修堤的积极分子，发动组与组、村与村、县与县间群众性的筑堤竞赛，表扬模范创造出大批的筑堤英雄。第七、领导干部要虚心向群众学习。应该请对河工有经验的人来作指导，要大量吸收群众中有治河经验的人参加领导。
