Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 24th: Moscow News: The Soviet Russian Supreme Soviet meeting, after three days of heated discussion on the Soviet Russian Five-Year Plan, has received full support from the meeting and was adopted on the 22nd through a vote on each article. The Soviet Russian Five-Year Plan stipulates that by 1950, Soviet Russian industry must supply 63 percent of the total Soviet steel production, 56.7 percent of coal, 91.4 percent of automobiles, and 87 percent of cotton. In terms of grains, the total Soviet production will be 127 million tons, with Soviet Russia responsible for 80 million tons. The restoration, especially the construction of new factories, mines, power plants, and railways, will accompany the full growth of cities.

At the beginning of this year, Soviet Russia already had 680 cities (628 at the beginning of 1941). By the end of the Five-Year Plan, Soviet Russia will have restored state-owned residential areas covering 44.45 million square meters. In 1946, all families displaced by the war must move into new housing. The total power generated by local power plants is planned to increase by 52 percent compared to 1940. By 1950, the output of local industries will exceed the pre-war level by 72 percent. Local industries in eastern and western Siberia, the Far East, and the Urals will increase four to five times compared to pre-war levels. Consumer production will exceed the 1940 level by 125 percent. 220 billion rubles will be invested in the livestock and dairy industries. The Five-Year Plan also stipulates the restoration of 20,000 schools destroyed by the Germans, as well as the construction of 1,080 new urban schools and over 4,000 rural schools. Moscow's industrial output will increase by three-tenths according to the plan. The investment in the construction plan for Moscow Province and City will reach 15 billion rubles. Agriculture in the province will be restored by the end of the Five-Year Plan. 1,900 collective farms will be electrified this year, and all farms, rural clubs, libraries, and every farm household will also be electrified.
