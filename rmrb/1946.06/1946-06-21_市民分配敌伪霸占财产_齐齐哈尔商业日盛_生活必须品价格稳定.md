Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 15th—Qiqihar, liberated for forty days, is experiencing increasing prosperity in industry and commerce. The people are beginning to stand up, and living conditions have improved initially. Prices of essential goods for ordinary citizens have fallen compared to before. Ordinary cloth has fallen from over 100 yuan per foot to 70 yuan, or even 60 yuan. All six districts in the city have begun to distribute enemy, puppet, and collaborator-seized houses and land. Houses seized from the people by traitors and local tyrants have also been distributed to the poor, allowing over 70 households to settle down. The distribution of enemy and puppet land in the suburbs is underway. The masses in each district who have received land and houses are flocking to the city government to exchange contracts and receive ownership certificates. In just one district, over 400 households exchanged for new contracts and received ownership certificates. Amid the widespread demand from the people to reduce rents, the rents in twelve out of the thirteen baojia in the ×An district were reduced after discussion by the masses. The Dezengsheng Flour Company, which was closed for five years under the rule and destruction of the enemy and puppet regime, has partially resumed production with the assistance of the democratic government, producing over 10,000 jin of flour per day. Over a hundred shops in the city have opened, and many are repairing their storefronts and expanding their businesses.

    【新华社齐齐哈尔十五日电】解放了四十天的齐齐哈尔，工商业日渐繁荣，人民开始翻身，生活已初步改善。一般市民生活必需品价格已较前下跌。普通布已由每尺百余元跌至七十元，甚至六十元。全市六个区，均已开始分配敌伪房产土地。汉奸恶霸侵占的民房也已分配给贫民，七十余户得以安居。市郊敌伪土地的分配正在进行中。各区得地得房之群众纷纷向市府换契，领取所有证。只一区换取新契，领导所有证者即有四百余户。在人民普遍要求减房租声中，×安区十三个保甲中十二个保的房租，经群众评议而减低。德增盛面粉公司在敌伪统治和摧残下歇业五年，现在民主政府协助下，已部分开工，日出面粉万余斤，全市百余家商店，均已开张，并有很多修理门面，扩大营业者。
