Xinhua News Agency, Songhua River Front, 8th: (Delayed) Our reporter Chen Yi reports: In late last month, this reporter followed the Democratic Allied Forces in their retreat from Sipingjie and Changchun. Along the way, I witnessed the soldiers of the Democratic Allied Forces and the peaceful people of Northeast China who accompanied them on foot. When I spoke with them, all expressed extreme indignation at the Kuomintang's warmongering elements disregarding the lives and deaths of the people of Northeast China and continuing to press the Democratic Allied Forces, who were retreating for peace. During this withdrawal from Sipingjie and Changchun, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the General Headquarters of the Democratic Allied Forces underwent very difficult persuasion and mobilization. Initially, the four companies of the First Security Regiment that defended Sipingjie, and a part of the Yang Division that guarded Sandaolinzi, resolutely refused to leave the front lines. Some soldiers squatted in the trenches and said passionately, "We are willing to block the advance of the Kuomintang army with our flesh and blood. We cannot bear to let our liberated Northeast compatriots be ravaged again by the fascist elements within the Kuomintang." The common people in the Sipingjie, Gongzhuling, and Changchun areas were even more reluctant to part ways. They earnestly said to the commanders and fighters of the Democratic Allied Forces, "We have fought with you for more than a month and firmly believe that you will definitely return." The people of Changchun showed a rare silence when the Democratic Allied Forces retreated. An old man at Dongda Bridge said to the reporter, "Alas! We are going to suffer again!" However, the soldiers of the Democratic Allied Forces finally accepted Commander Lin Biao's instruction to "prioritize peace and prioritize the lives of 800,000 people in Changchun," and tearfully bid farewell to the land they had liberated from the pseudo-bandits. If it were not for the Democratic Allied Forces' voluntary withdrawal, who knows what price the Kuomintang army would have to pay to enter these areas! Now, the Democratic Allied Forces have all retreated to pre-determined locations. A few days ago, this reporter saw General Lin Biao at the front line. He was so calm and composed, often inspecting the positions in a jeep captured by his subordinates, and talking cordially with the generals. When the reporter told him that the Central News Agency had broadcasted the news that he had been wounded and sent to Harbin for recuperation, he just smiled it off. He believes that the Kuomintang army has already sown the seeds of its own defeat in this frantic offensive that is against the entire Northeast people. The Kuomintang has suffered about 30,000 casualties, a division's anti-civil war uprising, and the recovery of Haicheng, Yingkou, Huadian, and other places by the Democratic Allied Forces. This further demonstrates the Democratic Allied Forces' bravery and skill in battle. All the soldiers of the Democratic Allied Forces unanimously believe that if the Kuomintang invaders continue to advance inch by inch, they will certainly encounter a crushing blow.

    国民党军一再进逼民主联军
    东北人民愤慨莫名
    民主联军将士坚信：进犯者如仍
    得寸进尺，决予粉碎打击。
    【新华社松花江前线八日电】（迟到）本社记者陈沂报导：上月下旬，记者随民主联军撤出四平街和长春，沿途目睹民主联军将士及徒手随行的东北和平人民，当我与他们交谈时，莫不对国民党内好战分子的不顾东北人民死活，继续向为和平而退让的民主联军进逼，表示万分愤慨。此次从四平街、长春撤出时，中共中央东北局、民主联军总司令部曾经过十分艰苦的说服动员，最初保卫四平街的保安一团四个连，与守卫三道林子的杨师一部，坚决不下火线，有些战士蹲在战壕里激昂地说：“我们愿以血肉挡住国民党军的进路，我们不忍让出我们解放了的东北同胞，再遭受国民党内法西斯分子的蹂躏”。四平街、公主岭、长春一带的老百姓，更是依依不舍，他们恳切地向民主联军指战员说：“同你们一起战了一个多月，深信你们是一定再回来的”。长春老百姓当民主联军撤退时，表现了稀有的沉默。东大桥的一个老人向记者说：“唉！我们又要受苦了”！但是，民主联军将士终于接受了林彪总司令的“以和平为重，以长春八十万人民的生命为重”的指示，流着热泪告别了由他们自己向伪匪手中解放出来的土地。如果不是民主联军自动撤退，国民党军要进入这些地区，又不知要付出多大代价！现在民主联军已全部撤至预定地点。几天以前，记者在前线战地见到林彪将军，他是那样的安祥和镇定，常常乘他部下缴获的吉普车视察阵地，和战将们亲切的谈话。当记者告诉他，中央社广播说他已受伤送哈尔滨休养的消息时，他只一笑置之。他认为国民党军在这种与全东北人民为敌的发狂的进攻中，早已种下了失败的种子。国民党已遭受了三万左右伤亡，一个师的反内战起义，海城、营口、桦甸等地被民主联军收复。更表示民主联军的英勇善战。民主联军全体将士，一致坚信如果国民党进犯者，再得寸进尺，一定会遭遇粉碎的打击。
