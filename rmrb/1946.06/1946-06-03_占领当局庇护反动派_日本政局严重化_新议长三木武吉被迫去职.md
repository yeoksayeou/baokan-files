    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th -- Moscow dispatch: A diplomatic observer for *Pravda* wrote an article commenting on the Japanese political situation, stating: Only a month and a half has passed since the Japanese parliamentary elections, and not only have the main internal difficulties not been resolved, but the fundamental and constantly worsening contradictions in Japan's domestic political situation have been fully exposed. Because not only the reactionary leaders of Japan, but even some representatives of the American occupying authorities, have participated in trying to ensure that the old political parties, which were responsible for the crimes of Japanese imperialist war in the past, seize control in the so-called new parliament. Anyone who draws the kind of conclusion formulated by some of the main representatives of the occupying authorities, namely to stubbornly insist that the election proves that the Japanese people are willing to establish a conservative government, must deliberately close their eyes to avoid seeing Japan's current political evolution. The actual situation in Japan proves that there is a chasm between the Japanese people and the parties that control the modern parliament. Although Hatoyama stepped down and Yoshida succeeded him, the reactionary essence of the Liberal Party has not been affected in the slightest. Recently, Japan has publicly launched attacks against the "lower strata of Japanese society," that is, the Japanese people's democratic movement. In essence, this is depriving the people of the right to express their suffering and make demands on the ruling groups. These ruling groups are receiving special protection from the occupying authorities, and this policy encourages anti-people and anti-democratic political groups. Obviously, the sooner this harmful policy is cancelled, the sooner and more effectively many political contradictions in Japan can be resolved.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th -- Tokyo dispatch: Bukichi Miki (Liberal Party), the new speaker of the Japanese parliament, has been forced to resign due to the exposure by the Japanese Communist Party on the opening ceremony day and the attacks by major Tokyo newspapers in recent days. Miki was a key figure in the Greater Japan Political Association and is one of the main war criminals.

    占领当局庇护反动派
    日本政局严重化
    新议长三木武吉被迫去职
    【新华社延安二十九日电】莫斯科讯：真理报外交观察家著文，评日本政局称：自日本议会选举以来，为时仅一个半月，不仅没有解决其内部的主要困难，而且已充分暴露日本国内政治局势的根本的而且不断严重化的矛盾。因为不仅日本的反动领袖，甚至连美国占领当局的某些代表，也参加其间尽力设法，使过去应对日本帝国主义战争罪恶负责的旧政党，在所谓新议会中攫取控制权，谁要是得出像占领当局某些主要代表所制定的那种结论，即硬说选举证明日本人民愿意建立守旧的政府，那是必须故意闭起眼睛，不去看日本目前的政治演变才办得到。日本实际情况证明，在日本人民大众与控制现代议会的这些政党间，存在着一道鸿沟。鸠山去职而吉田继任，但自由党的反动本质，并未受到丝毫影响。近来日本公开发动反对“日本社会下层分子”，即日本人民民主运动，实质上这是剥夺人民申诉他们的痛苦并向统治集团提出他们的要求的权利。这些统治集团，是得到占领当局的特殊庇护的，这种政策鼓励了反人民反民主的政治集团。显然，这种有害政策愈早取消，则日本国内许多政治矛盾，就可以愈快而且有效的解决。
    【新华社延安三十日电】东京讯：日本新议会议长三木武吉（自由党）已因日共在开幕典礼日的揭发，和东京各大报连日来的攻击，现已被迫辞职。按三木为大日本政治会要角，系主要战犯之一。
