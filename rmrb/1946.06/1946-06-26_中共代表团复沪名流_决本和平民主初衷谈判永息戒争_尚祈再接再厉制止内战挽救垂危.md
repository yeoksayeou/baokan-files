Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd. Shanghai cultural and industrial celebrities, including Ma Xulun and Tao Xingzhi, totaling 164 people, wrote to Chiang Kai-shek on the 8th of this month calling for an end to the civil war, and attached the full text of the letter to a copy sent to the CCP delegation, requesting it be forwarded to CCP Chairman Mao. It is now learned that the CCP representatives replied on the 11th, the original text is as follows:

To Mr. Yi Chu, Mr. Xingzhi, and all the esteemed gentlemen:

We have received your gracious letter and have been shown the letter to Chairman Chiang. We have read it carefully and are deeply moved by the sincerity and urgency of the words. We are filled with admiration! We believe that the failure of Chinese politics and the suffering of the people have now reached their peak. However, the warmongers within the ruling Kuomintang group, still relying on American arms assistance, are actively carrying out a full-scale anti-communist civil war. If these people are allowed to succeed, the country will be devastated! Therefore, our party has consistently advocated unconditional cessation of all conflicts within the country. Only by stopping domestic armed conflicts can a path towards democratic unity be found. We have insisted on this principle since the negotiations began. For this reason, thanks to the expanded voice of the people and the efforts of General Marshall, we finally achieved a ten-day ceasefire in the Northeast. Regardless of the sincerity of the Kuomintang authorities in this regard, our party is determined to conduct negotiations based on its consistent commitment to peace, democracy, unity, and unification, and hopes to achieve a long-term ceasefire and end the war altogether, so that the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the troop reorganization plan can be smoothly implemented. This would be a blessing for the country and the happiness of the people! However, there are still many difficulties ahead. We hope that you gentlemen will continue your efforts to stop the civil war, save the country from its perilous state, and promote the great cause of democracy. Time is pressing and the situation is urgent. We are unable to elaborate further. In addition to forwarding the letter to Comrade Mao Zedong as requested, we hereby respectfully reply and wish you all well!

　　中共代表团复沪名流
    决本和平民主初衷谈判永息戒争
    尚祈再接再厉制止内战挽救垂危
    【新华社南京二十三日电】沪文化界、实业界名流马叙伦、陶行知等一百六十四人，为呼配停止内战，曾于本月八日致书蒋介石，并将该书全文附寄中共代表团一份，请转中共毛主席。兹悉中共代表刚已于十一日回复，原文如下：
    夷初、行知诸先生大鉴：
    顷奉惠谢，并承示上蒋主席书，各诵祥环，弹觉辞危而情苦，感人至深，曷胜钦仰！窃以中国政事之败，民生之苦，于今已这极贴。而国民党统治集团中之好战分子，犹然恃美国武器之资助，积极进行全面反共之内战，没使此辈得逞，则域内势成糜烂！是以敌党于国内一切冲突、夙主无条件停止。蒋唯有停止国内武装冲突，民主团结才有途径可循，谈判以来即坚持此旨。以此之故，卒在扩大人民之呼声与马歇尔将军努力之下，获得东北停战十王日结果。姑不问国民党当局于此诚意若何，敌党决愿本一向和平民主团结统一之识志，进行谈判，并盼能从此长期停战，就息战争，俾使政协决议、整军方案得以顺利实行，斯为国家之福，人民之幸！惟前途困难甚多，尚新诸先生再接再厉，制止内战，挽救国运于垂危，张民主之大器，时迫事急，临顾不实，除遵嘱将函转毛泽东同志外，专此肃复，顺颂时绥！
