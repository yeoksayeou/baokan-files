    Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 3rd (delayed dispatch): The defense of Shengfang has been a complete victory. This democratic stronghold, which was heavily besieged by the Kuomintang army for nearly ten days, has now been successfully relieved. Under the persistent resistance of the local garrison, the invading army was forced to retreat to the Bailiutan and Hejiapu line on the night of the 31st of last month, and then continued to collapse eastward, retreating to Wangqingtuo, Anci, Deshenkou, Dongfugang, Ce City and other places. In the Battle of Shengfang, more than 1,500 Kuomintang and puppet troops were killed or wounded, and the casualties of officers were even more severe. According to what has been learned, Wu Guanjun, the commander of the 63rd Regiment, was wounded, as well as one battalion commander and one company commander from the same regiment. From the 121st Division, three battalion commanders and many company commanders were wounded. In the 129th Regiment, except for one company commander who survived, all other battalion and company commanders were either wounded or killed. The regimental commander cried and said, "I have never suffered such heavy losses in years." The Chiang army commander, furious at the defeat, shot and killed a battalion commander of the 363rd Regiment of the 121st Division of the 94th Army "as a warning." However, the Kuomintang authorities have not given up their ambitions, and the invading army is gathering reinforcements with the intention of attacking again. The Eighth Route Army is standing by, fully prepared. The brave men defending Shengfang claim that if the Chiang army dares to covet Shengfang again, they will be dealt an even greater blow.

    胜芳保卫战荣获全胜
    进犯之蒋伪军死伤千五百余
    【新华社河间三日电】（迟到）胜芳保卫战荣获全胜。此一被国民党军大举围攻近旬的民主堡垒，刻已胜利解围。进犯军在当地守军坚持抗击下，于上月三十一日夜，被迫撤至白牛滩、何家堡一线，旋复向东继续溃退，已分别撤至王庆坨、安次、得胜口、东府港、策城等地。此次胜芳之战，国民党军及伪军死伤一千五百余名，官佐伤亡更为惨重。据已获悉者，即有六三团团长吴冠军负伤，该团之营连长各一。一二一师之营长三及连长多人。其一二九团一个营，除连长一人幸免外，其余营连长均或伤或亡。该团团长大哭说：“数年来从未遭受这么大的损失”。蒋军指挥官因战事失利，大发雷霆，竟将九十四军一二一师三六三团一个营长枪杀，“以示惩戒”。但国民党当局野心未死，进犯军正集结待援，有再犯企图，八路军正严阵以待。保卫胜芳健儿，咸称蒋军如敢于再窥胜芳，当予更大打击。
