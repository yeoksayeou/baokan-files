    The Path of an Intellectual
    ——An Interview with Mr. Yang Xiwen, Director of the Shandong Education Department——
    Li Pu

    Mr. Yang is the only person I've seen in the Shandong Democratic Provincial Government who wears a traditional Chinese gown. Over his wide leather robe, he wears a blue cotton jacket, sports a neatly trimmed mustache, and a fur hat. Because of his physical disability, he always carries a cane. When he speaks, he is refined and gentle, using beautiful and appropriate language, and is also very humorous. All of this makes him seem very relaxed and comfortable, at peace with himself, which is especially in harmony with his background, personality, and work. He is currently the Director of the Education Department. Before the War of Resistance, he transferred from the Education Department of Qingdao University to Wuxi Education College. After graduating, he engaged in education, and once served as the director of the Second Shandong Provincial People's Education Guidance Zone. He remains non-partisan.

    He said that he came from a family of merchants and landlords. One of his brothers was arrested by the Kuomintang, which made him somewhat dissatisfied with their ruling style. However, coming from a warm family with room for maneuver, even if he had some sympathy for the revolution, he himself was timid about struggle and held an attitude of avoidance. He chose education as his career. He said, "I felt that this was more relaxed, and I wouldn't do many wrong things. Being a village teacher would be even more excusable."

    Like all good intellectuals, his steps were very heavy. In the early days of the War of Resistance, he sought out Han Fuju, Zhang Liyuan, Shen Honglie, and Fan Zhuxian, all in order to find a legal authority to legitimize his work against the war, so that his anti-war proposals could be implemented. I think this should be divided into two stages. Finding Han and Zhang was more focused on finding a legal basis, while finding Shen and Fan was more focused on finding a military force. Because the experience of the Han and Zhang period naturally gradually reduced his concept of legal authority, and the objective need was even more urgent for fighting, for military affairs, which made him naturally want to find an existing force. After these two failures, his anti-Japanese aspirations did not waver in the slightest. He wanted to resist the war, so what should he do? At this time, he actually cooperated with the Communist Party, truly turned his eyes to the broad masses of the people, did not rely on legal authority, did not rely on others, did not rely on existing forces, but relied on the people and himself, and started to work boldly.

    At the beginning of the war, he prepared to engage in resistance against the war in the Qingzhou area. Han Fuju's attitude was well known. He ran to Zouping to find Mr. Liang Shuming. Liang went to Jinan and felt that Han Fuju was not good. He said that no matter what Han did, he would resist, and he wanted Mr. Liang to help him obtain legality. He returned to Qingzhou, and the administrative commissioner Zhang Liyuan organized a political training office. He legally went to become the director. First, he ran training classes. Later, he discovered that Zhang Liyuan had accepted Han Fuju's orders and was preparing to flee. Zhang criticized the Luxi Commissioner for running too fast, leaving without fighting. He himself wanted to fight a bit before leaving. Mr. Yang replied to him: I came to resist the war, and the students in the training class also came to resist the war, you can't take them away. His relationship with Zhang deteriorated from then on. Later, Han Fuju was shot. He ran to Mengshan, taking three or four cadres and buying several guns. He said, "People who run education are always easy to approach young students." He associated with young students, wanting to create his own troops. This was the first time he wanted to do it himself.

    But he didn't know how to do it. The Mengyin County Chief had some bandit troops, saying he learned it from someone. He joked with Mr. Yang, saying that Mr. Yang would never be able to do it in his life. Yang saw that those guerrillas only smoked opium and were not presentable. He never believed they were doing it right. He went to Linyi and heard that someone had risen up in the Culai Mountain (Editor's note: The leader was Mr. Li Yu, the current chairman of the Shandong Democratic Provincial Government, who was then the secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party). Mr. Yang read some materials and felt that was the formal way to do it, so he wrote a letter. Soon, Qin Qirong began to clash with them. Mr. Yang said, "I know very well that Qin Qirong is a party hack." Mr. Yang went to Mengyin Xintai and found Mr. Liang Zhuhang, the current Director of the Civil Affairs Department. Together, they ran the Lunan Anti-Enemy Self-Rescue Youth School. Almost every family in Mengshan had guns. They started with eighty-odd students and twenty-odd guns. Gradually, more students came. Everyone in the school was called an alumnus, and those who couldn't come were called off-campus alumni, resisting the war while learning during the War of Resistance.

    "But I didn't know how to run it," he said. "No one took care of the meals. I participated too, pushing sand, standing guard, cooking, doing everything, but I didn't know how to get food or how to fight. A scholar is incompetent, and there are many regrets. We deeply felt that no one cared about the enemy's rear. Apart from scattered bandits, there was a large gap, and we had little political experience, so we were very distressed. After discussing it, everyone decided to find someone who knew how to fight." Mr. Yang went from Linyi to Xuzhou. Xuzhou fell. Hearing that Shen Honglie had gone from Cao County to Dong'a, he went to see him and felt that he was not really engaging in the War of Resistance, but only wanted to send his own people, sending Mr. Yang to be his secretary. Mr. Yang wanted to return to Lunan. Shen Honglie said he was daydreaming. So he went to Lucheng in Luxi to see the elder Fan Zhuxian. Fan was an old acquaintance. After seeing him, his impression was not bad, especially admiring the old man's administrative ability. He stayed to compile primary school textbooks for Mr. Fan. Soon, Shen Honglie arrived and instigated Mr. Fan's subordinates. Regarding the textbooks, Shen Honglie insisted that they be compiled by the provincial government. Not a single copy of the social science textbook, which Mr. Yang was the editor-in-chief of, was ever printed. Coincidentally, his friends in Lunan organized an Anti-Enemy Work Group. The person in charge was Mr. Tian Peizhi, the current vice president of Shandong University. Mr. Liang Zhuhang, Mr. Li Chengzhi and others were also there. They sent a telegram asking him to return. They also sent someone to contact Shen Honglie, and he returned to Lunan as Shen's representative, Li Chengzhi was ordered by Shen to run the Lunan Fourth Joint High School, and Mr. Yang went to help him, still wanting to legalize his own methods - that was already 1938.

    At that time, they were in Laiwu. One night, the enemy came. Mr. Yang said, "It is impossible not to fight, but we don't know how to fight. Let's discuss it and defend the city." It was during that battle that he was injured. A bullet entered his spinal column, and he fell in the wheat field by the city wall. It took two days and one night for the people to rescue him. Mr. Li Chengzhi and Mr. Liang Zhuhang sent him to Qilu Hospital in Jinan, where he stayed for a year. That was a year of great change in Shandong. Shen Honglie raised the banner of anti-communism. The Taihe Incident etc. all happened that year. After Shen Honglie's true colors were revealed without any disguise, Mr. Yang's friends, such as Mr. Li Chengzhi, Mr. Liang Zhuhang, Mr. Fan Mingshu, Mr. Tian Peizhi, etc., left him and organized the Anti-Enemy Association, uniting with the Communist Party in practical action. In the winter of 1939, they took Mr. Yang out of the hospital. The right and wrong was very clear. Mr. Yang resolutely embarked on the path that a kind-hearted and patriotic intellectual should take. His body was disabled, but his spirit was even more magnificent.

    By 1940, Shandong's patriotic and righteous people had established a temporary council, and Mr. Yang was also one of the participants. "I demanded that Shen Honglie come to report on his work." He said to me with a smile, still so calm and unrestrained. This man who had avoided struggle before the War of Resistance and pursued traditional legalization in the early stages of the War of Resistance, from then on held high the power of the people, the banner of the people's law, and appeared as a combatant. This was another key in his life, but he was still not excited at all, still showing only a sense of peace of mind.

    His injury was mainly in the spine next to his waist, and his lower limbs had completely lost sensation. Now, he cannot walk without being supported by someone. When the enemy swept through, he hid with the people in mountain gullies or underground caves. When there was a "situation," he would aim his gun at his chest, with live ammunition ready. Therefore, everyone first took his gun down, and secondly, they advised him to "massify" himself. At first, he was very unhappy, feeling that taking away his gun meant that he no longer had the final say, but later he thought that "massifying" himself was still a positive thing. Now it seems especially right. He had many encounters with the enemy. Once, he disguised himself as an ordinary peasant and escaped from the hands of the enemy and puppets. Once, he hid in the woods and watched several puppet soldiers walk over and lead his donkey away, no more than a hundred meters away from him. There were many such dangers. If he had had a gun in his hand and been a little impatient, he might have already shot himself. His nearly three-hour conversation with me gave rise to many dreams. His experience is precisely the path of tens of thousands of kind-hearted and patriotic intellectuals. Especially in these eight years, how many kind-hearted intellectuals like him have been driven by reason and educated by objective reality, going from timidity to bravery, from avoidance to struggle, breaking free from inherited concepts of legal authority, and becoming warriors for democratic rights, no longer looking to the high-ranking authorities, but entrusting their lives and hopes to the lower-class people. Their experience is deeply touching. I am very moved. I am not a novelist, but I cannot help but make a request to our contemporary novelists, hoping that some of you will study more of these intellectuals, create such a typical character for us, record this page of these people, give people a vivid lesson, so that more of our intellectuals will waste less effort and more directly embark on the path they should take.

    一个知识分子的道路
    ——访山东教育厅长杨希文先生——
    李普
    杨先生是山东民主省政府中我所见的唯一穿长袍的人，他的宽大的皮袍上面罩一件蓝布衫，挺着两撇八字胡，戴一顶皮帽子，因为身体残废，手杖总是不离身的，说起话来更是斯斯文文，修辞美好确当，又很幽默。这一切使人觉得他很潇洒舒适，心安理得，和他的出身性格和工作，尤其显得很调协。他现在是教育厅厅长，抗战前从青岛大学教育系转入无锡教育学院，毕业之后从事教育，曾经做过山东省第二民众教育辅导区的主任，至今仍是无党无派。
    他说他出身于一个经商地主的家庭，有一个哥哥曾被国民党逮捕过，使他对这统治的作风很有点不满。但是出身于一个温情家庭，有回环余地，即使对革命有点儿同情，自己对斗争却是怯懦的，抱着逃避的态度，他选择了教育做他的事业，他说：“自己觉得这样清松点，总还不致于做很多错误的事情，做乡村教员，更可以自恕吧”。
    和所有善良的知识分子一样，他的脚步是十分沉重的。在抗战初期，他找过韩复榘，找过张礼元、找过沈鸿烈、找过范筑先，为的是找一个合法的权力，使他的抗战工作合法，使他的抗战主张能够实行。这当中我想还应该分为两个阶段，找韩张更偏重于找合法根据，找沈范更偏重于找一个军事力量。因为韩张时期的经验使他的法统观念自然而然渐渐减轻了一些，而客观的需要更迫切的倒是打仗，倒是军事，使他自然而然的想望着去找一支现成的力量，这两者失败之后，他的抗日的志愿却没有丝毫动摇，他要抗战，那么怎么办呢？这时候他才在实际上和共产党合作起来，眼睛真正转向于广大的老百姓，不倚靠法统，不倚靠别人，不倚靠现成的力量，而倚靠人民和自己，大刀阔斧干起来。
    战事一开始，他准备在青州一带搞抗战。韩复榘的态度是大家了解的，他曾跑到邹平找梁漱溟先生，梁到济南，觉得韩复榘不好。他说不管韩怎么样，也要抗，他要梁先生帮他搞合法。他回到青州，行政专员张礼元组织政训处，他合法的去当处长，首先办训练班，后来他发现张礼元已经接受了韩复榘的命令，准备逃走。张对他批评鲁西专员跑得太快，没有打就走了，他自己是要打一打才走的。杨先生回答他说：我来是抗战的，训练班的学生也是要抗战才来的，你带不走。他和张的关系从此搞坏。后来韩复榘枪毙，他跑到蒙山，带了三四个干部，买了几支枪。他说：“办教育的人，和青年学生总容易接近”。他和青年学生来往，想自己搞部队，这是他想自己干起来的第一次。
    但是他不知道怎么个搞法。蒙阳县长搞了一些土匪部队，说是和什么人学来的。他和杨先生开玩笑，说杨先生一辈子也搞不起来。杨看见那些游击队尽吃大烟，不象样，总不相信他们搞得对。他到临沂，听说徂徕山有人起义（记者按：领导人就是现在山东民主省政府主席黎玉先生，那时候他是共产党山东省委书记），杨先生看了一些材料，觉得那是正式搞法，便写了一封信去，不久秦启荣同他们开始磨擦，杨先生说：“秦启荣是根党棍子，我是很知道的”。杨先生到蒙阴新泰，找到了现任民政厅长的梁竹航先生，同办鲁南抗敌自救青年学校，蒙山人民几乎家家有枪，他们就搞起八十几个学生，二十几支枪，渐渐有更多的学生来，学校里一概称为校友，不能来的称为校外校友，在抗战中学抗战。
    “但是我不会办”。他说：“没人管饭，我也参加，推沙、站岗、作饭，什么都干，但一不知道如何弄到饭吃，二不知道如何打仗。书生无能，感慨甚多。我们深觉敌后没人管，除零星土匪之外，空隙很大，而自己政治经验差，很苦闷。大家商量一下，要搞一个会打仗的人。”杨先生便从临沂到徐州，徐州失守，听说沈鸿烈从曹县到了东阿，便去见他，觉得他这个人不是实在搞抗战的，只想派自己人，派杨先生做秘书。杨先生要回鲁南，沈鸿烈说他空想，他便到鲁西聊城看范筑先老人，范是旧识，看了之后印象不坏，尤其称羡这位老人家的行政能力，他就留下给范先生编小学教材，不久，沈鸿烈到来，挑拨范先生的部下，关于教材，沈鸿烈一定要由省政府编，杨先生主编的社会科，始终一本也没有印。正巧他的朋友们在鲁南组织了一个抗敌工作团，负责人就是现任山东大学副校长田佩之先生，梁竹航、李澄之等先生也在那里，他们打电报来叫他回去。他们又派人来和沈鸿烈联络，他就以沈的代表的资格回到鲁南。李澄之先生奉沈命令办鲁南第四联合中学，杨先生便去帮他，还是想把他自己那一套合法化。——那已是二十七年了。
    那时候他们正在莱芜，有一天晚上，敌人来了，杨先生说：“不打是不行的，但是不会打，我们商量商量，守守城吧。”就在那次，他受了伤，子弹打进脊椎骨，倒在城边麦田里，过了两个白天，一个晚上，老百姓才把他救出来。李澄之、梁竹航两先生把他送到济南齐鲁医院，住了一年，那是山东大变化的一年，沈鸿烈打起反共的旗帜，泰和事件等等，都是那一年里发生的。沈鸿烈的面目毫无掩饰地暴露出来之后，杨先生的那批朋友们如李澄之、梁竹航、范明枢、田佩之等先生就离开了他们，组织了抗敌协会，在实际的行动上和共产党团结在一起。二十八年冬季他们把杨先生从医院接出来，是非是很明显的，杨先生坚决地走上了一个善良的爱国的知识分子所应该走的道路。他的身体残废了，但是他的气魄更加壮阔了。
    到二十九年，山东爱国的正义的人民建立了临时参议会，杨先生也是参加的一个，“我要求沈鸿烈来报告工作”。他微笑着向我说，还是那样地平静潇洒，这个抗战以前逃避斗争，抗战初期追求传统的合法化的人，从此高举着人民的权力，人民的法的旗帜，做为一员战将而出现了。这又是他生命史上的一个关键，但是他还是一点也不激动，还是一样只现出心安理得神气。
    他的伤主要在脊椎骨腰旁，下肢曾经完全失去知觉，现在离人扶着不能走。敌人扫荡的时候，他跟老百姓一道躲在山沟或者地洞里。有“情况”的时候他就用枪对准自己的胸口，实弹以待。因此大家首先下他的枪，第二就劝他“群众化”。起先他很不高兴，觉着下掉枪，自己的最后决定权都就没有了，后来一想“群众化”到还是积极的，现在看来尤其对，他曾经有许多次遇着敌人，有一次他化装为个普通的老百姓，从敌伪手中逃脱，有一次他躲在树林子里，亲眼看着几个伪军走过来，把他的驴子牵去，距离他不过一百米，诸如此类的危险是很多的，如果他有枪在手里，稍微沉不住气一点，也许已经把自己打死了吧。和他将近三小时的谈话，使我发生许多的梦想。他的经历正是成千成万善良的爱国的知识分子的道路。特别是这八年来，有多少善良的知识分子象他这样，为理性驱使着，又为客观的现实所教育，经怯懦到勇敢，从逃避到斗争，从因袭的法统观念中挣脱出来，做为一个争取民主权利的战士，眼睛不再向高高在上的权威，而把自己的生命和希望依托于下层的老百姓。他们的经验是深深感人的，我很感动，我不是一个写小说的人，我禁不住要向我们当代的小说家提一个要求，希望你们之中有谁多多研究一些这样的智识分子，给我们创造一个这样的典型，记下这些人的一页，给人们一个生动的教训，使我们更多的智识分子少浪费些气力，更直捷地走上他们应走的道路。
