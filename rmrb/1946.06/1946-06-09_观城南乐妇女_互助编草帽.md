    From our Heze correspondent: Women in Guancheng and Nanle are actively weaving straw hat braids to develop sideline production. In Li Shangu Village, Guancheng First District, the 90 households can sell 7,000 yuan worth of braids every day. Zhao Fa'ai's wife weaves quickly and well, selling 150 yuan worth of braids per day, which not only covers the family's living expenses for five people but also leaves a surplus of 50 yuan. Later, village cadres established mutual aid groups in the village, and the women in the village became even more enthusiastic. Now, the entire village can sell 10,000 yuan worth of braids every day, with an average daily income of over 100 yuan per household. Niu Jiu'e and four other female students from Nanle Chenggao Elementary School also weave braids in their spare time from studying. In forty days, they earned 1,700 yuan, solving the difficulty of paying for firewood and vegetables. When other women saw how much money they were making, they became envious, and they picked up wheat straw from home and started braiding whenever they had free time and they organized mutual aid groups. The Wan Dong'e mutual aid group in Nanle City, composed of girls aged fifteen or sixteen, borrowed 1,300 yuan in March to buy thread and weave straw hats. In eleven days, they earned 1,400 yuan, with each person earning more than 1,000 yuan. Moreover, they can learn to read a few words every day, so their families are very happy and often urge them to weave together.
