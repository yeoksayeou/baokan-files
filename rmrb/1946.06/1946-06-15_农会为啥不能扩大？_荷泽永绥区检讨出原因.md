Why Can't Farmers' Associations Expand?
Yongshui District, Heze, Examines the Reasons

[This newspaper Heze news] Yongshui District in Heze has a total of seventy-eight natural villages, of which forty-nine villages already have farmers' associations with a total of eight hundred and fifty members. Each village's farmers' association only has six or seven, or a dozen members, and the composition is entirely extremely poor masses (destitute and a few poor peasants). Most of the poor peasants have not yet joined the farmers' association, and middle peasants are even further out of the question. Therefore, mobilizing the broad masses to open up the situation in the entire district has become a problem. In order to organize and mobilize the broad masses and launch large-scale mass movements, the following examination was made as to why farmers' associations cannot expand: (1) The leadership's mindset of only thinking about tenants and hired farmhands draws a circle around the masses, making them afraid to act boldly and consult the higher-ups on everything. Therefore, the movement is confined to a narrow circle. (2) The leadership has a viewpoint of bestowing favors. The masses only know that the Eighth Route Army Joint Association is looking for a bowl of rice for the poor, and poor peasants who have a bowl of rice cannot join the farmers' association. This makes them unwilling to develop members, fearing that they will have less fruit to share. (3) Poor ideological education. They do not recognize that it is their own strength, and exclude poor peasants and middle peasants who have food to eat. When development is mentioned, they say: "There are no poor people in our village anymore. They have all joined the farmers' association. It's just us few who have nothing to eat." After the district reviewed, it determined that in the future it will truly start from the demands of the masses, strengthen education, and make members realize that middle peasants and poor peasants are all oppressed. If we do not expand our strength and organize the unity of the majority, it will be difficult for us poor people to turn over.

    农会为啥不能扩大？
    荷泽永绥区检讨出原因
    【本报荷泽讯】荷泽永绥区，共有七十八个自然村，已有四十九个村子有了农会，会员共有八百五十名，各村的农会会员只有六七个、十几个，成份上全是极贫苦的群众（赤贫与少数贫农）。大多数贫农还未到农会里来，中农更谈不到了。因此发动广大群众打开全区的局面，就成了问题。为了组织发动广大群众，展开大规模的群众运动，就农会为啥不能扩大作出以下检讨：（一）领导上的佃雇贫的思想，给群众划了圈子，使群众不敢大胆行动，什么事都请示上级，领导不从群众要求出发。因此运动即局限于狭小的圈子里（二）领导上的恩赐观点。群众仅知道八路军联合会是给穷人找碗饭吃，有碗饭的贫农就不能参加农会，这形成他们就不愿发展会员，恐怕少分果实。（三）思想教育差，他们认不清那是自己的力量，把有饭吃的贫农及中农都关在门外，提到发展，他们便说：“俺庄上没有穷人了，都参加农会了，就是俺这几个人没有啥吃”。区里检讨后，确定今后真正从群众要求出发，加强教育，使会员认清中农贫农都是被压迫的，不扩大力量不组织团结多数，我们穷人就难翻身。
