【Report from our newspaper in Heze, 16th】 Zhao Mingfu (i.e., the representative of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government), a member of the Yellow River Committee of Ji-Lu-Yu, and four others, departed from Heze on the 14th for Bian and then Beijing to negotiate with the Kuomintang side regarding the implementation of the Nanjing Agreement, to expedite the allocation of funds, food, materials, and relocation relief funds for the project, and to immediately stop the continuation of the breach closure project. Before his departure, our reporter interviewed Mr. Zhao, asking about the progress of the dyke restoration project in the Liberated Areas and the purpose of his trip to Beijing. He replied as follows:

Regarding the progress of the dyke restoration project in the Liberated Areas, Mr. Zhao said: "After the Nanjing Agreement, the representatives of the Liberated Areas returned to Heze on the 25th. In Juan City, Dongming, Changyuan and other counties, 20,000 people started work on the 26th, ten days earlier than the 'striving to start work by June 5th' stipulated in the Nanjing Agreement. Although it was the wheat harvest season, the masses along the river actively started work as early as possible. The county governments along the river stopped all other work and tried everything possible to help solve the difficulties of the masses in harvesting wheat. Cadres personally went to the dykes to organize and lead the masses in their work. By the beginning of June, the repair of the remaining dyke sections in the first, second, and fourth districts had been partially completed. In the first district alone, 50,000 people were working, completing over 390,000 cubic meters of earthwork in five days. After the joint meeting of section chiefs of various repair sections on June 3rd, it was decided to start large-scale construction on June 10th. Currently, the first and second repair sections have fully started work. By the 15th, the number of workers working on the entire line could reach 230,000. Currently, it is the busy farming season, and the masses have put aside their own production, brought their own food, endured hunger and hardship, and participated in the dyke restoration work. Under various difficult conditions, the democratic governments and masses in the Liberated Areas have actively implemented the Nanjing Agreement."

Regarding the purpose of his trip to Beijing for negotiations, Mr. Zhao continued: "According to Articles 5 and 6 of the oral agreement in Nanjing between Mr. Zhou Enlai, Mr. Franke, and Mr. Todd, whether to continue the breach closure rock-filling project should be determined after June 15th, depending on the progress of the dyke restoration project downstream, and then determined with the consent of both parties. Although the dyke restoration work in the Liberated Areas is currently progressing actively, the Kuomintang side has failed to guarantee various supplies on a priority and expeditious basis as agreed in the Nanjing Agreement. Although work has started for more than ten days, only 300 tons of flour have been transported. Funds for the project, relocation relief funds, and various materials needed for the project have not yet been allocated, severely restricting the effectiveness of the dyke restoration project. At the same time, there is still no news of the start of the dyke restoration project in the Kuomintang areas above Changyuan. Kuomintang troops in Changyuan and Kaocheng have occupied villages along the river dykes, suppressed the masses restoring the dykes, and sabotaged the dyke restoration work. Under these circumstances, the continuation of the breach closure project must be stopped. We continue to insist on the three reservations in the Nanjing Agreement, demanding that the Kuomintang side implement the Nanjing Agreement, guarantee the priority and expeditious supply of funds, food, materials, and other materials, and immediately stop the continuation of the breach closure project and not dump rocks."

    国民党拖延供给阻碍复堤
    赵明甫再度赴京交涉
    我继续坚持三项保留意见，要求国方优先尽速供给，
    立即停止堵口工程。
    【本报荷泽十六日电】冀鲁豫黄委会委员赵明甫氏（即晋冀鲁豫边府代表）等五人，十四日由荷赴汴转京，与国民党方面商谈执行南京协议，迅速拨发工款、工粮、器材及迁移救济费，并立即停止继续堵口工程问题。行前记者访问赵氏，询问解放区复堤工程进行情形，及此次赴京商谈目的，承答如下：
    关于解放区复堤工程进行情形，赵氏赵：“南京协议后，解放区代表于二十五日返回荷泽，鄄城、东明、长垣等县，二十六日即有两万人动工，较南京协议所规定之‘争取于六月五日开工’提早了十日。虽时值麦收时期，沿河群众仍积极尽早上工，沿河各县政府则停止所有其他工作，想尽一切方法，帮助解决群众麦收困难，干部亲自上堤，组织领导群众做工，在六月初，一、二、四分区之修补堤岸残缺工程已完成一部，仅一分区即有五万人上工，五天内共完成三十九万余方土。六月三日各修防段，处长联席会议后，确定自六月十日开始大动工，现第一、二修防处已完全动工，至十五日全线动工之工人可达二十三万。现正值农忙时期，群众放下自己的生产，自带食粮，忍饥耐苦，参加复堤工作。在各种困难条件下，解放区的民主政府及群众是积极的执行了南京协议的。”
    关于此次赴京谈判之目的，赵氏继称：“按周恩来、福兰克茵、塔德三先生之南京口头协议的第五六两条，堵口抛石工程是否继续进行，须待至六月十五日前、视下游复堤工程进行情形，然后经双方同意而定。现在解放区之复堤工作虽正积极进行，但因国民党方面未能按照南京协议，优先尽速保证各种供给，虽已开工十余天，面粉仅运来三百吨。工款迁移救济费及各种工程需要之器材，则尚未拨发，严重的限制了复堤工程之速效。同时长垣以上国民党地区之复堤工程，至今仍无动工消息，长垣考城之国民党部队并侵占河堤村庄，镇压复堤群众，破坏复堤工作。在这种情况下，必须停止继续堵口工程，我们继续坚持南京协议中之三项保留意见，要求国民党方面执行南京协议，保证工款、工粮、器材等各种物资之优先尽速供给，并立即停止继续堵口工程，不得抛石。”
