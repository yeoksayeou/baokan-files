Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 6th: Qiqihar citizens are reasonably demanding rent reductions. According to incomplete statistics, more than half of the past twenty households have reduced rents to landlords who have unreasonably raised rents to more than ten households or have unreasonably evicted tenants. Some residents have organized tenant associations during the rent reduction process. At a meeting of 6,000 households with housing, both parties put forward three representatives as rent negotiation committee members. The rent amount per household is pre-determined to be discussed by both the landlord and the tenant, and then submitted to the general meeting by the committee for fair decision. The First District of the city decided that the maximum rent should not exceed twice the house price before the surrender of the Japanese invaders last year. For rents collected after March this year that exceed the above limit, tenants should still be reimbursed. At a conference in the Third District against landlords unreasonably evicting tenants, it was decided that: (1) Landlords shall not force tenants to move out due to rent reductions. (2) Reduce rent and guarantee rent payment. (3) Abolish monthly rent and implement bi-annual rent payment.

    齐齐哈尔市民合理减低房租
    【新华社齐齐哈尔六日电】齐齐哈尔市民合理要求减低房租，据不完全统计，过去二十户中已有十户以上，向高抬房租至十余户和无理撵走房客的房东进行减低房租。一部份居民在减房租中，组织了房客联合会，在六千户有房户商讨会上，双方推出代表三人为房租商讨委员，预定每户租额经东客双方面商后，再由委员会交大会公平决定。本市一区决定租额最高不得超过去年日寇投降前房价的二倍，今年三月后所收房租，有超过上述限度的，仍得归正房客。在三区反对房东无理撵走房户大会上决定：（一）房东不得因减低房租而强迫房户搬家。（二）减低房租，保证交租。（三）取消月租，实行两季交租。
