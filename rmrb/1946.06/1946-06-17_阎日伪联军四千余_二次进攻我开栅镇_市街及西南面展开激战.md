Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhong Front, 14th: More than 4,000 Yan troops, concentrated in the bow-shaped line of Jiaocheng, Fenyang, and Wenshui in the Jinzhong Plain, launched a full-scale fierce attack on Kai Zha Town (20 miles north of Wenshui) in the Wenshui-Jiaocheng liberated area at dawn on the 12th. The Yan troops involved in this battle included parts of the three columns (7th, 8th, and 9th) led by Yang Cheng, the former commander of the puppet "剿共" Second Army, attached with 140 Japanese soldiers, 3 tanks, the 211th Regiment of the 71st Division led by puppet traitor Shen Rui, the 1st Regiment of the 49th Division led by Zhao Shiling, the 2nd Regiment of the 44th Division led by Cao Guozhong, a part of the 2nd Regiment of the 37th Division originally stationed in Wenshui, and the 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of the 40th Division in Jiaocheng (reorganized from the puppet security team). At the beginning of the battle, the Yan troops immediately occupied the commanding height of Yao'ertou, ten miles north of Kai Zha Town, the pillbox on the back mountain of Nanbei Xu Village, ten miles southwest, and Guangxian Town, ten miles northeast, with superior forces. Under the cover of artillery and tanks, they rushed to the outer moat east of the town but were repelled by our defending troops. At 2:00 PM, the Yan troops launched a second fierce attack, which was still unsuccessful. Around 4:00 PM, the Yan troops continued to launch a third fierce attack. Under the impact of artillery fire and tanks, our military position on the east side was destroyed, and some Yan troops took the opportunity to rush into the town. Fierce fighting is currently taking place in the streets and southwest area. Kai Zha was originally a stronghold of the enemy during the enemy occupation. It was liberated by our army in August last year. With the support of the democratic government, commerce has been fully restored, and it has become the most prosperous town in the Jinzhong Plain. On January 18th of this year, more than 1,000 Yan-Japanese-Puppet Allied Forces launched a fierce attack but failed. This is the second attack on the town by the Yan side after the ceasefire order.
