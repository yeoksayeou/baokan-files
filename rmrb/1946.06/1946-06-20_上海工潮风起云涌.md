Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: Shanghai News: Last month, the city's grain prices soared wildly, like a kite with a broken string, and labor strikes erupted again like a storm. Starting from the 18th, Shanghai British Tram workers, driven by the pressure of making a living, went on a general strike. After six days, their living conditions were slightly adjusted, and a temporary resolution was reached on the 23rd. Seventy-odd sanitation workers went on strike together from the 18th, leading to piles of garbage accumulating on the streets. They even carried their brooms and shovels to petition. The police局 (局 Ju = station, office, bureau) dispatched red police cars, mounted three machine guns, and forcibly dispersed them. On the 20th, they petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau again, and finally obtained approval for subsidies and resumed work on the 21st. However, the Bureau of Health did not express any opinion on the subsidies, and the labor unrest still lingered. The customs labor strike has not yet been resolved, and some dockworkers have temporarily switched to rickshaw pulling. Kuomintang special agent head Gu Zhenggang, disregarding the life and death of the workers, personally went to Shanghai and convened a meeting of all trade union directors, supervisors, and representatives of workers' organizations on the 29th. He announced on the spot measures to suppress the labor unrest: (1) Strikes and slowdowns are not allowed. (2) Inciters of labor unrest are strictly prohibited. (3) No wages will be paid during strikes or slowdowns, and no demands may be made in any name. (4) Laborers must absolutely obey discipline. Workers who heard this were filled with indignation.

    上海工潮风起云涌
    【新华社延安十五日电】沪讯：上月份本市粮价狂涨，如风筝断线，工潮遂复风起云涌。自十八日，沪英商电车工人迫于生计，全体罢工，迄六日后，生活稍获调整，二十三日暂告解决。清道夫七十余人，于十八日起一致罢扫，遂致街道拉○堆积如山，并全体自负扫帚铁铲，游行请愿。警局出动红色警车，架机枪三挺，强迫解散。二十日彼等又向社会局请愿，终获允许津补，于二十一日复工。唯卫生局对津补不表意见，工潮尚有余波。海关工潮仍未解决，部分码头工人，已暂时改业黄包车夫。国民党特务头子谷正纲，不顾工人死活，竟亲到沪市，于二十九日召集各工会理监事，及工人团体代表开会，当场宣布镇压工潮办法：（一）不准罢工怠工。（二）严禁煽动工潮者。（三）在罢工怠工期间，不发工资，并不得以任何名义提出要求。（四）劳工应绝对服从纪律。工人闻者，莫不愤慨。
