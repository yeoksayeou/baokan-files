    Yalu River Paper Mill
    Successfully Trial-Produces Roll Paper
    [Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 4th] With high enthusiasm, workers at the Yalu River Paper Mill have successfully trial-produced roll paper. Due to the improvement of their material lives, political and social status, and political awareness, the workers at the factory have greatly enhanced their work attitude and enthusiasm. Recently, workers Cai Zixin, Guo Yaoqiu, Liu Qingsheng, and others, after twenty days of research and experimentation, successfully completed the manufacture of roll paper for the first time at 2:00 PM on May 15th. It was sent to the Liaodong Printing Factory for testing that night. Everyone believed it could be used like the paper of the past, but the thickness was not uniform enough, and it was easy to break when printing. The factory is now producing and improving it at the same time. This achievement is a great contribution to the news and cultural undertakings of the liberated Northeast.

    鸭绿江造纸厂
    试制卷筒纸成功
    【新华社安东四日电】鸭绿江造纸厂工友，以高度积极性，试造卷筒纸成功。该厂工友由于物质生活，政治社会地位及政治认识的提高，因而劳动态度及积极性亦大为增强，最近该厂工人蔡子新、郭耀秋、刘顷生等，以二十天的研究和试验，已于五月十五日下午二时，首次完成卷筒纸的制造，当夜送到辽东印刷厂试验，大家认为可和过去的纸一样用，惟厚薄尚不够均匀，印时易断，现该厂正一面制造，一面改进中。这一成就，对于解放后的东北新闻文化事业，贡献很大。
