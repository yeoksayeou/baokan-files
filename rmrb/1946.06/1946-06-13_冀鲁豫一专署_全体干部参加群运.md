    Jilu Yu No. 1 Special District Office
    All Cadres Participate in Mass Movement
    [Our newspaper, Heze News] Since the Jilu Yu No. 1 Special District Office launched the mass mobilization work, the overall work situation has undergone new changes. From Commissioner Xie to cadres in various offices, everyone has focused their main energy on the mass movement. Commissioner Xie frequently studied various issues in the mass movement with cadres in places like Pingyin. Chief Secretary Xing was busy collecting materials related to the mass movement from newspapers and various sources for research. The Head of the Education Section led a large number of cadres to the countryside to participate in the mass movement. There were very few cadres left in the office, but the atmosphere was not as dull as before. Everyone, centering on "mobilizing the masses," was intensely studying mass issues and grassroots situations. While handling necessary daily affairs, they also invited cadres like the Discipline Director of the sub-committee to talk about mass work issues, and everyone was learning very humbly. In addition, in terms of leadership, the main responsible persons of each system at the special district level jointly formed a Mass Movement Committee to study the central issue of how to specifically support the masses, eliminate their concerns, and how to implement policies according to the situation in the new areas. They formulated some appropriate new laws and regulations based on actual needs, so that cadres would have more basis for handling problems.

    冀鲁豫一专署
    全体干部参加群运
    【本报荷泽讯】冀鲁豫一专署机关，自进行发动群众工作之后，整个工作局面有了新的变化。从谢专员到各地处干部同志，都把主要精力集中到了群众运动上。谢专员经常与平阴等地干部详细研究群运中各种问题，邢秘书主任忙着搜集报纸上与各方面关于群众运动的材料，进行研究。教育科长带着大批干部下乡参加群运。机关里剩下的干部很少，但空气却不似以往那样沉闷，大家围绕着“发动群众”这个中心，紧张的研究着群众问题与下层情况。一面处理必要的日常事务，一面请分会纪主任等群运干部给谈些群众工作问题，大家都很虚心的学习着。另外，在领导上，由专署级各系统主要负责人共组民运委员会，研究的中心问题，是如何具体给群众撑腰，消除群众顾虑，及按新区情况如何执行政策。根据实际需要制订一些适当的新法令，使干部在处理问题上更有依据。
