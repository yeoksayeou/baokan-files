Since the end of the war, many British and American newspapers and magazines have been clamoring about Britain's post-war economic difficulties. There are indeed many difficulties. An economic advisor at the British Embassy in the United States once said, "Export or die." This is the key to Britain's post-war economic problems. Why are exports so important to Britain? Britain is a capitalist country that is not naturally endowed. To maintain its national food needs, it must import 50% of its total grain requirements from abroad each year. During the war, due to the expansion of cultivated land and the adoption of some emergency measures, grain self-sufficiency reached about 70%. But even so, it still had to import grain worth 8 to 9 million pounds from the United States each year. The sudden cessation of the Lend-Lease Act immediately exacerbated the food shortage. It is expected that there will be no increase in British grain production in the future; on the contrary, it may decrease, so it will still be necessary to import a portion of grain for consumption.

In addition to grain, Britain also feels a significant shortage of industrial raw materials. Apart from coal and iron, it lacks most of the raw materials necessary to support industrial production. It must import all of its oil, copper, cotton, nickel, manganese, zinc, potassium carbonate, and nearly all of its tin. It also needs to import 25% of its iron ore requirements, as well as 75% of its wool, phosphates, and sulfur. Only coal and nitrates do not need to be imported. However, coal production has declined significantly in recent years, and it is not only unable to export, but even self-sufficiency is becoming difficult.

Therefore, before the war, Britain was a country with a trade deficit. During the period of 1936-1939, Britain's average annual trade deficit was 388 million pounds. Although this deficit was huge, it could still be made up for at the time. Commodity exports could offset 60% of total imports, and the remaining 40% could be subsidized by the following income: overseas investment income of 202 million pounds, shipping income of 105 million pounds, banking and insurance income of 36 million pounds, and other ten types of economic income.

However, these incomes have now been greatly reduced. During the war, in order to purchase the necessary food and raw materials from abroad, Britain sold 1.18 billion pounds of stocks, which has reduced Britain's post-war foreign investment income to only 170 million pounds (another estimate is even lower, only 138 million pounds). Not only that, but Britain was heavily in debt at the end of the war, owing 33 million pounds in foreign debt. In addition, as a result of the German submarine warfare, British merchant ships suffered considerable losses. Before the war, Britain had 17.5 million tons of merchant ships, which has now been reduced to 13.5 million tons, so future shipping income will also decrease. As for income from banking, insurance, and transaction fees, it is expected to be less than the pre-war amount due to post-war competition from other countries (mainly the United States) and the implementation of new trade methods. According to British Prime Minister Attlee, in the past year, Britain had to pay 2 billion pounds for importing food and industrial raw materials, while Britain could only pay 752 million pounds (including 300 million pounds in annual exports and 450 million pounds in other economic income), a shortfall of 1.3 billion pounds. Naturally, such a huge trade deficit is only a wartime phenomenon, but it can give people a sense of the difficulties facing Britain after the war.

Therefore, in the post-war period, in order to ensure the import of essential food and raw materials, to maintain a level of production and living equivalent to pre-war levels, to compensate for the sharp decline in overseas investment and shipping income, and to avoid a huge trade deficit, Britain must greatly increase exports. According to British official estimates, post-war British exports must increase by 75% compared to the most prosperous period before the war (1938, total export value of 470 million pounds). According to other experts (including Soviet economic authority Varga), it must increase by 50% compared to pre-war levels, otherwise, it can only greatly reduce Britain's production and living standards, which is tantamount to waiting for death.

"Export or die" – that is the real meaning here.

What does Britain need to do to increase exports? First of all, Britain must increase production. Only by producing more goods can exports be increased. Before the war, Britain's exports accounted for about 16% of its total production. If exports are to be increased by 75%, total production must be increased by 12%. Before the war, the largest part of Britain's exports were textiles, metal products, machinery, and coal, and the situation will not change much after the war. Therefore, to increase exports is to increase production in these three major categories.

Regarding textiles, they accounted for about 30% of Britain's total exports before the war. Textile production fell by 64% in the first four years of the war, but its equipment did not suffer much damage due to the war, but was idled or turned to produce other military supplies. It is not a problem for it to return to its pre-war production level after the war, but it is difficult to produce more textiles than before the war. Because the production technology of the British textile industry is the most backward among the world's three major textile exporting countries (Britain, the United States, and Japan), with automatic machines accounting for 5% (automatic machines account for 95% in the American textile industry). Moreover, in terms of its raw materials (cotton, flax, silk), increasing production must increase raw material imports, which contradicts making up for imports. Therefore, it is difficult for this type of production to have a large increase.

As for metal products and machinery, they accounted for about 25% of total exports before the war. This type of production has the potential to increase after the war because its equipment and technology have been greatly improved during the war to manufacture munitions. This may be the most important part of Britain's increased production after the war. However, the wartime increase in British hardware and machinery industry relied heavily on the government's overall control and planning, as well as large amounts of investment. Otherwise, this industrial sector, due to having the same weaknesses as other British industrial sectors, namely, dispersed management and lack of cooperation, it would be difficult to greatly increase production. This problem still exists after the war. The reason why the British Parliament passed the nationalization of the steel industry is precisely because of this.

As for coal exports, they accounted for 6% of British exports before the war, but its total output has decreased from 231 million tons in 1939 to 184 million tons in 1944. In this way, the coal that could have been exported is not even enough for self-sufficiency. The reason for the decline in British coal production is due to outdated machinery, many coal pits being nearly depleted, reduced production efficiency, and labor shortages. The British Labor government, in view of this, implemented coal industry nationalization, hoping to improve the above-mentioned situations. However, according to estimates by Horner, a member of the Central Committee of the British Communist Party, abandoning old pits and excavating new mines is not something that can be done in a few months, but will take several years. Therefore, it is not something that can be achieved overnight for Britain to increase coal production to self-sufficiency, and even have a surplus for export.

From the above analysis, it seems that it is generally possible for Britain to increase its production by 12% after the war, but it must overcome many difficulties. It requires improvements in domestic economic policies, and it will take more than a year or two to achieve a 12% increase in production, but rather three or four years. This period is indeed a difficult transition period for Britain.

In order to increase exports by 50% to 75%, in addition to considering increasing production, it is necessary to look at the market situation. Even if Britain can increase production by 12% compared to before the war, it is very difficult to sell these products on the world market. The basic reason is the expansion of American capital into the world market.

During the war, Britain, being busy with meeting the needs of the war, greatly reduced commercial exports. At the most serious time, in the winter of 1943, it was only 25% of the pre-war level. American goods took this opportunity to replace Britain and establish stable trade ties in many countries, which is particularly evident in Latin America. After the war, in order to escape the economic crisis of overproduction, its exports must increase by three to five times the pre-war annual average (3.1 billion US dollars) from 1931 to 1939. Shortly after the war ended, the United States used the liquidation of Lend-Lease materials and credit loans as means to obtain trade privileges in many countries, even including Britain. The United States loaned 3.75 billion US dollars to Britain on the condition that Britain agree to abolish imperial preference (that is, the special trade rights enjoyed by Britain in its dominions and colonies), abolish the Sterling Area, and tariff barriers. In this way, the United States not only squeezed out British goods outside the British Empire but also created favorable conditions for competing with Britain within the British Empire. The United States has abundant resources, strong capital, huge productivity, and superior technology, which is difficult for Britain to match. This is the most serious difficulty for British exports after the war.

Secondly, another difficulty for British exports after the war is that the productivity of several of its dominions has greatly developed during the war. In the five years of the war, Canada's increase in productivity exceeded the level of the previous 25 years, and it has become the world's third-largest trading nation. Industrial production in Australia and New Zealand has also greatly increased. In this way, these dominions, which were British industrial product markets before the war, will not buy British goods after the war.

The third difficulty for British exports after the war is its anti-democratic foreign policy. The implementation of this policy has led to the deterioration of Britain's relations with many countries, and thus trade with these countries has come to a standstill. For example, with the Soviet Union and the new democracies in Eastern and Southeastern Europe, these countries could have bought a large number of foreign goods. However, due to the impropriety of Britain's foreign policy, relations have deteriorated. Whether these countries will buy a large number of goods from Britain depends on whether Britain's diplomatic relations with these countries improve. At present, trade is completely at a standstill.

In summary, it is already very difficult for Britain's exports to the world market after the war to return to pre-war levels. If it is to increase by 50% to 75%, that is, to increase to 635 million to 750 million pounds per year, it will be extremely difficult. The only way for Britain to solve this difficulty is to wage an increasingly fierce struggle against the United States on a global scale. This struggle is one of the main characteristics of the post-war capitalist world. (Editor's note: This article was broadcast by Xinhua News Agency.

    战后英国对外贸易问题
    战争结束以来，英国和美国的许多报纸和杂志就嚷着英国战后的经济困难了。困难是很多的，英国驻美大使馆的一位经济顾问曾经说：“不输出，就是死亡”。这是英国战后经济问题的关键。为什么输出对于英国这样重要呢？英国是资本主义国家中一个得天不厚的国家，为了维持国民粮食需要，它每年要从国外输入粮食总需要量的百分之五十。战争期中，由于扩大了耕地面积，和采取了一些紧急办法，曾使得粮食自给百分之七十左右。但纵使如此，还得每年从美国运入价值八九百万镑的粮食。租借法案的突然制止，使粮食困难立刻加重起来。预料今后英国粮食生产不会有什么增加，相反还可能减少，因此仍得运入一部分粮食，以供消费。
    除粮食外，英国工业原料也甚感不足。它除了煤铁以外，缺乏支持工业生产所必须的大部分原料。它必须输入全部石油、铜、棉、镍、锰、锌、炭酸钾及近乎全部的锡，而铁矿亦需输入其需要量的百分之二十五，以及羊毛、磷酸盐、硫磺的百分之七十五，仅仅煤炭与硝酸盐不用输入。不过煤炭近年生产已大大下降，不但不能输出，连自给也感觉不够了。
    因此在战前，英国是一个入超的国家。在一九三六——三九年期间，英国每年平均入超三八八百万镑。这种出入不敷的差额虽巨，但在当时仍旧可以有办法来弥缝，还可以用商品输出，来抵消全部输入的百分之六十，而其余不足的百分之四十，则以下列收入来贴补：计海外投资收入二○二百万镑，航运收入一○五百万镑，银行与保险收入三六百万镑，以及其他十种经济收入等。
    然而现在这些收入都大大减少了，因为在战争期中，英国为了从国外购买所需粮食及原料，曾卖出了一一、八亿镑股票，这就使得英国战后国外投资收入只有一七○百万镑（另一估计不及此数，仅有一三八百万镑）。不但如此，英国在战争末期，债台高筑，共欠外债三十三万磅。另外又因为德寇潜艇战争的结果，使英国商船损失颇大。战前英国有商船一七、五百万吨，现已减至一三、五百万吨，故今后船运收入亦将减少。至于银行保险及交易手续费等的收入，亦将因战后各国的竞争（主要是美国），及实行新的贸易方法之结果，预料不及战前数额。据英首相艾德礼说：在去年中，英国由于从外国购进粮食与工业原料，须付出二十亿镑，而英国仅能支付七、五二镑（包括全年输出三亿镑及其他经济收入四、五亿镑），不足达十三亿镑之巨。自然，这样巨额的入超，仅是战时的现象，但是它可以使人体会到战后英国的困难。
    因此，在战后为着保证输入必需的粮食与原料，以保持相当于战前的出产和生活水平，为了弥补海外投资、航运等收入的锐减，以免巨额入超，战后英国必须大大增加输出。据英国官方估计，战后英国输出须为战前最有盛时期（一九三八年，出口总值为四七○百万镑）增加百分之七十五。而据一般其他专家（包括苏联经济学权威瓦尔加在内）估计，则须比战前增加百分之五十，否则就只能大大降低英国的生产和生活水平，这不啻是束手待毙。
    “不输出就是死亡”——其真实意义就在这里。
    为了增加输出，英国需要做什么呢？首先英国必须增加生产，只有生产更多的货物，才能使输出增加。在战前的英国输出，约为其总生产量的百分之十六，如果要增加输出百分之七十五，就要增加总生产量百分之十二。战前的英国输出商品中，最大部分是纺织品、金属品、机器及煤炭，在战后情况也不会有所改变。因此要增加输出，就是要这三大类生产的增加。
    关于纺织品，它在战前英国输出总额中占百分之三十左右，纺织业在战争的头四年，生产量降落了百分之六十四，但其设备并没有因战争而受多大损失，只是闲置着或转而生产别的军需品。战后他恢复到战前的生产量，是不成问题的，但是如果要生产比战前更多的纺织品，那就困难了。因为英国纺织工业的生产技术，是世界三大纺织输出国（英、美、日）中最落后的，自动机器有百分之五（美国纺织工业中自动机占百分之九十五），而且就其原料（棉、麻、丝）来说，增加生产又必须增加原料进口，这与弥补进口发生矛盾，因此这一类生产势难有很大的增加。
    至于金属品及机器，在战前占出口总额的百分之二十五左右，这一类生产在战后有增加的可能，因为战时为了制造军火，其设备与技术有很大的改进，这可能是英国战后增加生产的最重要的部分。不过英国五金及机器工业，在战时的增产，多赖政府方面的通盘统制与筹划，以及大量的投资，否则这一工业部门由于具有与英国其他工业部门相同的弱点，即经营的分散与各不相谋，大量的增加生产是困难的。这一问题在战后仍然存在，日前英国国会通过钢铁工业国有化，其原因即在于此。
    至于煤的输出，战前占英国输出的百分之六，但其总产量在一九三九年到一九四四年中，已由二三一百万吨减至一八四百万吨，这样一来，原可输出的煤炭，连自给也不够了。英国煤炭减产的原因，是由于机器陈旧，许多煤坑都是近于枯竭，生产效率减低，劳力缺乏所致。英工党政府有鉴于此，乃实行煤业国有，希望能对上述各种情况有所改良。但是据英共中委霍恩勒估计，抛弃旧坑开掘新矿，却不是几个月可以做到的，而是要几年才能做成的。因此英国要增加煤产到自给，和甚至有余以供输出，并非一蹴而成。
    从上述的分析看来，战后英国要比战前增加百分之十二的生产量，大致是可以办得到的，不过它必须克服许多困难，它要求国内经济政策有所改良，而且要达到增产百分之十二，亦非一年半载可以做到的，而非三数年不可。在这期间，的确是英国的艰苦的过渡时期。
    为了增加输出百分之五十至七十五，除了考虑增加生产外，便要看一看市场的情况了。即使英国能够比战前增加生产百分之十二，但是要把这些生产品在世界市场上销售，却是很不容易的事。基本的原因，是美国资本向世界市场的扩展。
    在战时，英国由于忙于应付战争的需要，商业输出大大减少，在最严重的时间。一九四三年冬，仅及战前百分之二十五，美国商品乘此机会取英国而代之，在许多国家内建立了稳固的贸易联系，这在拉丁美洲特别显著。战后美国为了逃避生产过剩的经济危机，其出口必须较战前一九三一年——三九年的每年平均数（三十一亿美元）增加三倍至五倍。在战争刚刚结束后不久，美国便以清算租借物资及信用贷款为手段，在许多国家取得了贸易的特权，甚至连英国也不能例外。美国贷款三十七亿五千万美元予英国，以英国答应取消帝国优先权（即英国在其自治领与殖民地中享受的贸易特殊权），废除金镑集团及关税壁垒为条件。这样一来，美国就不仅在大英帝国以外排挤英国商品，而且在大英帝国内部造成了和英国竞争的有利条件。美国握有丰富的资源，雄厚的资本，庞大的生产力，以及优越的技术，英国实难与之匹敌，这是战后英国输出最严重的困难。
    其次，英国战后输出的另一个困难，是它的自治领中，有几个在战争中生产力大大发展。加拿大在战争五年中，生产力的增加，超过战前二十五年的程度，已一跃为世界第三大贸易国。澳洲纽西兰的工业生产，亦大见增加。这样一来，这些在战前还是英国工业品市场的自治领，战后便不会买英国的商品了。
    英国战后输出的第三个困难，是它反民主的外交政策，这种政策实行的结果，使英国对许多国家的关系恶化，因而对这些国家的贸易陷于停顿。例如对苏联和东欧及东南欧等新民主主义的国家，这些国家本来可以买大量的外国货，由于英国的这种外交政策的失当而引起关系的恶化，这些国家是否会向英国买大量的货物，那要看英国对这些国家的外交关系是否改善而定，目前贸易是完全停顿的。
    综上以观，战后英国向世界市场的输出，要恢复战前的水平，已是很吃力的了。如果要增加百分之五十至七十五，即增至每年六万三千五百万至七万五千万镑，那就极其困难了。英国为要解决这一困难，唯一的出路就是在全世界范围内对美国进行日益剧烈的斗争，这种斗争是战后资本主义世界的主要特点之一。（编者按：本文系新华社播发，因电文脱漏，删去一大段）
