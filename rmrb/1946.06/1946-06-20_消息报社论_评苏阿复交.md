Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 15th: Moscow Dispatch: Following the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Argentina, *Izvestia* commented in an editorial: "The Soviet-Argentine diplomatic and commercial agreement was signed after Argentine public opinion urged the establishment of normal relations with the Soviet Union. This public opinion includes different strata of the people. The Argentine newspaper *Noticias Gráficas* stated: 'The demand to establish diplomatic and commercial relations with the Soviet Union reflects the sentiment of broad strata of the national people and is related to Argentina's national interests, because some people in the reactionary group are trying to infringe upon Argentina's interests in establishing normal relations between two equal countries.' The establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and one of the largest republics in Latin America is based on the principles of the Soviet Union's foreign policy of international cooperation, with the aim of increasing peace and security on the basis of equality and mutual respect for national interests. The Soviet Union has adhered to these principles since the first day of its founding, and it is not her fault that she has not had formal diplomatic and commercial relations with Argentina for twenty-eight years. In 1926, the Soviet Union had already established a branch of a trust company in Buenos Aires, whose task was to develop trade between the two countries. In 1931, Argentine reactionaries, instigated by foreign superiors, infringed upon the branch, thus ending the Soviet Union's goodwill measures. The proposal of the broad masses of the Argentine people to establish diplomatic and commercial relations with the Soviet Union shows that they have learned from their own experience that not establishing diplomatic relations with the great Soviet state weakens Argentina's political position, fails to achieve peace and security, and runs counter to its national interests. What aroused this awareness was the understanding of the decisive role played by the Soviet Union in defeating German, Italian, and Japanese fascism, while Germany and Japan had infringed upon the independence of various South American republics. The establishment of formal relations between the Soviet Union and Argentina will serve the cause of peace, thereby strengthening security, which is beneficial to both parties."

    评苏阿复交
    【新华社延安十五日电】莫斯科讯：苏联与阿根廷重复国交后，消息报社论对此评称：苏阿外交与商业协定，是在阿根廷公共舆论敦促与苏联建立正常关系之后签订的，这些舆论包括人民中不相同的各阶层。阿报“诺蒂西亚”称：要求与苏联建立外交与商业关系，是反映了全国人民广大阶层的情绪，并关系阿国的民族利益。因为反动集团中某些人士，正试图侵犯阿国在建立两平等国家正常关系的利益。至于苏联与拉丁美洲最大共和国之一建立外交关系，是根据苏联国际合作的外交政策之原则。其目的在于在平等与相互照顾国家利益的基础上，增长和平与安全。苏联从立国第一天起，即恪守这些原则，而她二十八年和阿根廷没有正式外交与商业关系，并不是她的过错。一九二六年苏联已在布宜诺斯艾利斯曾设立信托公司分公司，其任务在发展两国贸易。一九三一年阿根廷反动分子，侵犯该分公司（这是有外国上层人士煽动的），因此终止了苏联善意的措施。广大阿根廷人民建议与苏联建立外交商业关系，标明他们已从自身经验中，学习到不与伟大苏维埃国家缔结邦交，便减弱了阿国的政治地位，不能达到和平与安全，并与其民族利益背道而驰。激起这样觉悟的，是从了解苏联在击败德意日法西斯所起的决定作用，而德日二国曾侵犯了南美各共和国的独立。苏阿两国间正式关系的建立，将为和平事业服务，从而加强安全，这对双方均属有益。
