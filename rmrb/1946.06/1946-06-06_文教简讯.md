	Xingtai City: Eight Hundred Middle School Students Engage in Current Affairs Studies
	More than eight hundred teachers and students from four secondary schools in Xingtai, including Xingtai Normal School, No. 1 Middle School, Yide Middle School, and Agricultural Vocational School, have launched enthusiastic current affairs studies. They have adopted a method of free thinking, raising questions, discussing, and debating. The main issues they are focusing on discussing are: (1) Who is for the people and who is against the people? (2) Is the power of the people greater, or is the power against the people greater? How can the magnitude of power be seen? (3) Who is responsible for the civil war? To whom will victory belong? More than 120 out of 140 students at Yide Middle School spoke. At the Xingtai Normal School meeting, Gao Jichang, the son of General Gao Shuxun, compared the situation in Xi'an under Kuomintang rule with the liberated areas. He said, "Students in Xi'an have no democracy or freedom." Many students from the Great Rear Area also used their personal experiences to illustrate the dark rule of the Kuomintang, which further clarified everyone's thinking. (Wang He)

    邢市八百中学生进行时事学习
    邢台邢师、一中、义德、农职等四个中等学校师生八百余人，展开热烈的时事学习。采取自由思想提出问题讨论争辩的方法，主要集中讨论的问题：（一）谁为人民谁反对人民？（二）为人民的力量大选是反人民的力量大？从那里看力量大小？（三）内战责任属谁？胜利属谁？等。义德中学一百四十余人，就有一百二十余人发言。邢师大会上高树勋将军公子高继昌，以他在国民党统治下的西安情况和解放区作对比，他说：“西安学生没有一点民主自由”。还有不少大后方来的学生，以他们亲身的体验，说明国民党的黑暗统治，大家思想更加明确。（王和）
