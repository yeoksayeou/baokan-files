Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: The Kuomintang National Defense Supreme Committee's decision on the 5th to sell out inland waterway navigation rights has aroused concerns from all sectors of society. Although Peng Xuepei, the Kuomintang Minister of Propaganda, tried to explain it away at a press conference on the 11th, he could not conceal the Kuomintang authorities' treacherous and pro-foreign actions. Even within the Kuomintang-controlled National Political Council, some information has been revealed. According to a Central News Agency report from Nanjing on the 14th: The Standing Committee of the Political Council held a temporary meeting today and passed eleven proposals, one of which was "Zheng Kuiyi and others proposed that the government should promptly cancel the proposal to open inland waterways to foreign vessels in order to safeguard the country's shipping industry. The resolution was to hand it over to a group for research and request the Ministry of Transportation to send representatives to attend and report." The passage of the proposal proves that the Kuomintang National Defense Supreme Committee's decision is indeed a betrayal of the country and a humiliation of the nation.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: On June 6th, Shanghai's Wenhui Daily published an editorial entitled "Please Do Not Sacrifice Navigation Rights," criticizing the Kuomintang government's decision to allow foreign ships to unload goods in the four commercial ports of Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, and Hankou. The article first pointed out: "No matter what the reason, this kind of act of betraying the country and humiliating the nation is absolutely not allowed to happen." It then listed facts and cited reliable statistics to refute the government's excuse of "strengthening repatriation transportation," saying: "The Kuomintang authorities received 200,000 to 300,000 tons of ships from the enemy and puppet regimes. Together with newly purchased ships and those of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Minsheng Company, there are a total of 450,000 tons (almost the same as the 510,000 tons before the war), which can barely cope with the repatriation work." It then pointed out that the biggest reason for the ship shortage is the civil war. The newspaper said: "More than 90% of all ships in the country are in the hands of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and more than 90% of the ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are transferred to transport troops." The newspaper expressed infinite pain and anger at this, saying: "In order to fight the civil war, the entire shipping industry has been suffocated, the repatriation work has been stalled, and now this result is used as a reason to sacrifice sovereignty, introduce wolves into the house, attack the lifeline of our own shipping industry, and destroy the integrity of navigation rights. How can this be justified?!" Finally, the newspaper called on the people of the whole country and the domestic shipping industry to recognize this major issue of the country's rise and fall, and to urgently demand that the government cancel this move. It also pointed out: "The only way to speed up repatriation transportation is to stop the civil war immediately."

    扩大内战出卖内河航权
    国民党政府丧权辱国
    上海文汇报著论抨击
    【新华社延安十五日电】国民党国防最高委员会，于五日通过出卖同河航行权的决议后，已引起社会各界人士之疑虑。虽然国民党中宣部长彭学沛曾在十一日记者招待会上强词解释，但并不能掩盖国民党当局丧权媚外的事实。国民党一党包办的国参会中，也有所透露。据中央社南京十四日电报导：参政会驻会委员会今日临时会议中，通过提案十一件，其中之一为“郑揆一等提，拟请政府迅速取消开放外累航行内河之议，以维护本国航业案，决议交小组研究，呈请交通部派员出席报告。”通过提案，证明国民党国防最高委员会的决议，的确是丧权辱国。
    【新华社延安十六日电】六月六日沪文汇报以“请勿断送航权”为题，发表社论，抨击国民党政府准许外轮在南京、芜湖、九江、汉口四个商港卸货之举。文中首先指出：“无论有任何理由，此种丧权辱国的事，都是绝对不许发生的”。并列举事实引用可靠统计，驳斥政府“加强复员运输”的借口说：“国民党当局，从敌伪方面接收这船只，有二三十万吨。加上新购的和招商局及民生公司船只，共有四十五万吨（比之战前一十万吨相差无几），对复员工作勉强可以应付”。从而指出船荒的最大原因，就是内战。该报说：“全国所有船只百分之九十以上，在国营招商局手里，而招商局的船又有百分之九十以上，调去运兵”。该报对此表示无限痛愤谓：“为了打内战，把整个航运窒息了，把复员工作停滞了，现在又以这个结果作为原因，不惜丧失主权，引狼入室，打击我们自己航业界的命脉，破坏航权完整，这又何从说起？！”最后该报呼吁全国民众及国内航业界认识这个国家兴废的大问题，急起要求政府取消此举。并指出：“要加紧复员运输，唯一的办法，是火速停止内战”。
