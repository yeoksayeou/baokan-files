[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] At 2:00 PM on the 9th, people from over twenty villages including Nanqiji and Chenyi in Yongnian held a solemn memorial meeting for the eight martyrs, including Ye Shuangquan and Chai Guoen, who were killed in the "June 6th Massacre" by the Kuomintang reactionary aircraft. At the meeting, family members of the victims successively accused the Kuomintang reactionaries of the atrocities of indiscriminately bombing peaceful residents, unanimously demanding that the local Eighth Route Army eliminate harm for the people, quickly disarm the bandit troops inside the city, and hand over the bandit leaders Tie Motou and Wang Zemin, and other war criminals to the people for public trial. Feng Hezi’s father from Fengyan Village, with tears streaming down his face, painfully recounted the tragic death of Feng Hezi, saying, "My eleven-year-old child was picking up wheat ears in the wheat field, I don't know what crime he committed, but he was actually shot to death by the Kuomintang reactionaries' aircraft with machine guns." Lian Enzi from Chenyi Village was an only child, his father was blind, and the whole family of five depended on him for a living. The plane blew off one of his legs and one arm. The Kuomintang reactionaries actually caused the Lian family to have no descendants. Lian En's mother wept uncontrollably, and everyone present shed tears for her. Jiao Fubao from Sigezhuang had his leg blown off, and Duan Shengzi from Mazhuang had both feet blown off, his head blown to smithereens. Feng Huzi from Fengyan Village was only eight years old, and this young life suffered eight wounds. The Lu Changgui family of Nanqiji was even more tragic. The seventeen-year-old eldest son, Lu Fulai, was injured in the left leg; the fourteen-year-old Lu Chunlai was blown open, his intestines flowing out, and died in the wheat field. What crimes did these dead and wounded commit? Their deaths were too tragic. Accusers followed one after another, and slogans from below the stage were shouted continuously from the mouths of every angry person: "Who inflicted these pains?" "It is the Kuomintang reactionaries." "It is the bandit Tie Motou Wang Zemin in the city." We demand that the Eighth Route Army stand up for the people of Yongnian and immediately disarm Xu and Wang, two traitors." "We want to capture Tie Motou and Wang Zemin and avenge the people killed in the entire county!"

    At this time, a group of old ladies and young women who had been harmed by Tie Motou and Wang Zemin in the past also came to the stage to complain and accuse. Li Gui's mother from Lijiazhuang said, "My child participated in the war against Japan for more than six years. He was wounded and returned home to recuperate. As soon as he recovered, Wang Zemin dragged him into the river and drowned him alive. My second child was also beaten to death by Wang Zemin for no reason. The wife in front of the refugee cart who escaped from the city said, "My family of six, the traitor Wang Zemin would not allow us to leave the city, and four of us were killed by the Kuomintang's plane dropping big cakes. My husband was buried alive by the puppet army, and my son sacrificed on the front line of the war against Japan. I want to avenge my family's grievances!" Liu Junde's wife from Sigezhuang had two children killed, and their bodies were never found. A young woman from Chenyi Village had her mother beaten to death, and her father and brother were captured four or five years ago, with no news. Her house was set on fire and completely burned by "Old Tiezi." There were too many people accusing Xu and Wang of their crimes. Until the sun set, the people were still endlessly vying to pour out all the bitterness they had suffered for the past eight years.

    Finally, the conference sent a telegram to the people of the whole country accusing the Kuomintang reactionaries of indiscriminately bombing the people of Yongnian, and wrote a letter to the leaders of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region, asking them to stand up for the people, disarm the Yongnian puppet bandit troops, and avenge the people of Yongnian, stating: We ask you to immediately mobilize a large army to eliminate the Yongnian puppet bandits: We cannot bear it, we cannot bear it at all. If we do not eliminate it now, and raise the tiger in the future, it will hurt more people! Hurry, hurry, hurry up and do it!

    We also ask you to protest to the Kuomintang government on our behalf, asking it to implement the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, dismiss the puppet bandit traitors, severely punish war criminals, and ask the murderers who bombed peaceful residents this time to admit their mistakes to the people of the whole country, guarantee the people's freedom of life, and compensate for treatment and other expenses, otherwise our broad masses of people will roar, causing all adverse consequences, and they should bear full responsibility.

    永年二十余村群众
    愤悼“六六”冤死同胞
    一致痛诉国民党反动派飞机惨炸暴行
    要求我军为民除害解除城内伪匪武装
    【本报特讯】九日下午二时，永年南七级、陈义等二十几个村的老百姓，为“六六惨案”被国民党反动派飞机炸死之叶双全、柴国恩等八位烈士举行隆重的追悼大会。会上，被害者家属纷纷控诉国民党反动派无理轰炸和平居民之暴行，一致要求当地八路军为人民除害，迅速解除城内伪匪武装，将伪匪头子铁磨头、王泽民等战争罪犯交人民公审。冯沿村冯合子的父亲，热泪横流，痛述冯合子被害惨状，他说：“俺十一岁小孩子到麦田拾麦穗，不知究竟犯了什么罪，竟被国民党反动派的飞机用机枪扫射死。”陈义村连恩子是个独生子，父亲是个瞎子，全家五口，靠他过活，飞机炸掉他一条腿，一只手臂，国民党反动派竟使连家断了后根。连恩的母亲泣不成声，全场人们都为之下泪，司格庄焦甫保被炸断了腿，借马庄段生子炸断了双足，脑袋被炸得无影无踪。冯沿庄冯虎子刚满八岁，在这幼小之生灵上，竟受了八处创伤。南七级吕长贵一家更为凄惨，十七岁的大儿子吕福来，被打伤了左腿；十四岁的吕春来被炸得膛开肠流，死于麦田。这些死者伤者，究竟有什么罪，他们死的太惨了。诉苦者一个跟着一个，台下的口号，接连不断从每个怒吼的人们口里喊出：“是谁加给的这些痛苦呢？”“是国民党反动派。”“是城内的伪匪铁磨头王泽民。”咱们要求八路军替永年老百姓作主，立即解除许、王二逆的武装。”“咱们要捉住铁磨头、王泽民、替全县被杀害的老百姓报仇！”
    这时，一群过去受过铁磨头王泽民残害的老太太、年青的妇女，也走到台前来伸冤诉苦。李家庄李贵的娘说：“俺孩子参加抗战六年多，因负伤归家休养，刚养好，被王泽民拉到河里活活淹死，俺的二孩子也是平白无辜被王泽民打死的。从城里逃出的难民马车前的老婆说：“我们一家六口，汉奸王泽民不准出城，让国民党的飞机扔大饼砸死了四口，我的丈夫被伪军活埋了，我的儿子是在前线抗日牺牲的，我这一家子的冤仇，我要报清呀！”司格庄刘俊德的老婆，两个孩子被杀死，连尸首都没找到。陈义村一个青年妇女，娘被打死，父亲哥哥被捉走四五年，迄无音信，她的房子被“老铁子”放火烧了个净光。控诉许王二逆罪恶的人实在太多了，直至夕阳西下时，老百姓还在滔滔不绝地争着倒出自己八年来所有的苦水。
    最后大会通电，向全国人民控诉国民党反动派无理惨炸永年人民，并写信给晋冀鲁豫军区各首长，要求为人民作主，解除永年伪匪武装，替永年人民报仇，内称：我们向你们要求，立刻调动大军把永年伪匪消灭吧：我们不能忍受了，一点也不能忍受了，现在不把它消灭，将来把虎养大，会伤害更多的人呀！快，快，快动手吧！
    还请你们代表咱们向国民党政府提出抗议，叫他执行政协决议，遣散伪匪汉奸，严惩战争罪犯，并叫这次轰炸向和平居民的凶手向全国人民承认错误，保障人民生命自由，并赔偿治疗等费，否则我们广大人民要怒吼了，引起一切不良后果，应由他们负完全责任。
