Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 30th (Delayed Dispatch). The Liaodong Military Region troops of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army completely recovered Anshan, the steel industry center south of Shenyang, on the 26th. Since the Kuomintang army, persisting in civil war, occupied the area along the Changchun Railway south of Shenyang, they have implemented brutal and terrifying rule over the local people, and have continuously harassed the defense areas of the Democratic Allied Army to the east. At the request of the people of Anshan and other places, the Liaodong Military Region troops of the Democratic Allied Army engaged in fierce battles with the Kuomintang army in Anshan for two days and nights starting on the 24th. The entire 551st Regiment of the Kuomintang 184th Division was annihilated. On the 26th, the Democratic Allied Army entered the city amidst the fervent cheers of the people of Anshan, and controlled the railway lines to Shahe and near Haicheng. At the same time, a part of the Kuomintang army's 25th Division from Liaoyang, led by the deputy division commander, rushed to reinforce them overnight, but was also defeated. Anshan was originally stationed by the Democratic Allied Army, and a democratic government was established as early as October last year. In March of this year, the Republic of China authorities violated the truce agreement and continued to expand the civil war in the Northeast. With the aid of the United States, a large number of troops were transported in. Since the arrival of the new army, they began to attack our Liaozhong, Taian, Panshan and other places. Anshan was also occupied by the Kuomintang army on March 24. This time, the Democratic Allied Army recovered Anshan, and the southern section of the Changchun Railway occupied by the Kuomintang army was cut off. This is a blow to the attempt of the warmongering elements within the Kuomintang to wantonly expand the civil war.

    应当地人民之请
    我军恢复鞍山
    切断长春路南段予好战者以打击
    【新华社鞍山三十日电】（迟到）东北民主联军辽东军区部队，于二十六日完全收复沈阳以南之钢铁业中心鞍山市。自坚持内战之国民党军侵占沈阳以南之长春的沿线后，对当地人民实施残暴恐怖统治，并向东侧民主联军防地不断扰犯。民主联军辽东军区部队，应鞍山等地人民之请，自二十四日起与鞍山国民党军激战两昼夜，国民党军一八四师五五一团全部溃灭，民主联军于二十六日在鞍山人民狂热欢呼中进驻该市，并控制了至沙河、至海城附近之铁路线。同时，辽阳国民党军二十五师一部，由副师长率领，星夜增援，亦被击溃。按鞍山原为民主联军驻地，去年十月即已建立起民主政权，今年三月间，民国当局违反停战协定，在东北继续扩大内战，借美国援助，运来大批军队，自新陆军到达后，即开始向我辽中、台安、盘山等地进攻，三月二十四日鞍山亦被国民党军占去。此次民主联军收复鞍山，国民党军侵占之长春铁路南段乃告切断，这对国民党内好战分子肆意扩大内战的企图，是一个打击。
