    Government Rapidly Provides Disaster Relief to Victims in Daming and Wei Counties
    Over 70,000 People Helped with Food and Shelter
    [Report from Our Weixian Correspondent] Due to incomplete dyke repairs in over 160 villages in Daming and Wei Counties, the Zhang River breached its banks, causing flooding. The water level in the flatlands reached five to ten feet, destroying crops, wheat fields, and houses. The masses had no choice but to seek refuge in trees. To rescue the people, the democratic governments of the two counties mobilized all county and district cadres to gather all available boats to transport corn cakes (already reaching over 3,500 catties) and rescue the disaster victims. Our Jinnan Administrative Office, the Third Administrative Office, and the Daming and Wei County governments allocated 2.5 million catties of grain and 800,000 yuan in relief funds. Currently, over 70,000 people in over 160 villages have been rescued, resolving their difficulties with food and shelter. The masses gratefully said, "Before the incident, there were several floods, but the government under the leadership of the Kuomintang ignored them, and the number of people who starved and drowned was incalculable. Now, if it weren't for the Communist Party and the democratic government providing relief, the people in this area would not be able to survive."
