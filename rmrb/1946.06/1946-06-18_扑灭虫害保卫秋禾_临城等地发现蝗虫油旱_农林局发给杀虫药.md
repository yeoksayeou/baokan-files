    Eliminate Pests and Protect the Autumn Harvest
    Locusts and Leafhoppers Discovered in Lincheng and Other Areas; Agricultural and Forestry Bureau Distributes Insecticides
    [This newspaper, Changzhi] Following the discovery of locusts in Jia Village, Lucheng, locusts have also been discovered in Nanxin Village, Licheng. Children in the village dug up five nests of locust eggs a few days ago. On the 6th, while catching black bugs, they discovered two types of nymphs: green and earth-colored. They are now organizing children to catch them. Locusts have also been discovered in villages east of the Shahe Pinghan Railway. The area spans one and a half li from east to west and one li from north to south. The density is such that one can hit five or six with a single slap. Cadres from the seventh district of the county have rushed to organize the masses to catch them to prevent a widespread disaster.
    [This newspaper, Xingtai] Leafhoppers have begun to appear on cotton seedlings in various counties in western Hebei under the First Administrative Region. The Construction Section of the Commissioner's Office has instructed all counties to take action to protect cotton seedlings, calling on them to adopt the experience of Li Cheng, Lu Cheng, and other places last year. Most are using tobacco leaf water (one jin of tobacco leaves mixed with fourteen jin of water and boiled for one hour) to eliminate leafhoppers. The Municipal Agricultural and Forestry Bureau has also distributed 74 sprayers and 2,700 jin of insecticides stored in the bureau to six counties including Lincheng, Neiqiu, Xingtai, Shahe, Gaoyi, and Zanhuang. Leafhoppers are cotton pests that have commonly occurred in the Taihang Mountains over the years. According to statistics from the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau of the area last year, the average area of cotton seedlings damaged in nine counties, including Licheng, Wu'an, Pingshun, Zuoquan, Xiangyuan, Wuxiang, Wencheng, Shexian, and Xingxi, reached 65%, with Wu'an reaching as high as 80%. Due to the low snowfall last winter and the warm spring this year, it is estimated that they will occur widely in the future. Production newsletters in Licheng, Pingshun, and other places have issued urgent calls to prevent leafhoppers.
