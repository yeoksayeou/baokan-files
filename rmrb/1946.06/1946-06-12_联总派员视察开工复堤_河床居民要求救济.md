    UNRRA Personnel Inspect Levee Reconstruction Commencement
    Riverbed Residents Demand Relief
    [Heze, 8th dispatch] (Delayed) UNRRA Chief Engineer Todd and four UNRRA personnel (all Americans), Li Zhici of the Friends' Ambulance Unit (British), Yan Zhengxing, a technical expert from the National Water Resources Commission, Zhang Jichun, Chief of Engineering of the Yellow River Commission, Liu Shangqin, captain of the Ninth Working Team of the Executive Yuan's Henan Branch, and seven team members, totaling sixteen people, accompanied by Zhao Mingfu, a representative from the Liberated Area, arrived in Heze on the 1st. The next morning, accompanied by Liu Jixing, Deputy Director of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Yellow River Commission, and others, they inspected the commencement of levee reconstruction and the resettlement of residents in the riverbed. The repairs of the levee at several locations between Longmenkou (where the breach occurred in 1935) near Linpuji and Gezhuangji are beginning to take shape, and most of the newly built houses in the riverbed villages have been demolished. Mr. Todd and others expressed their admiration for the Liberated Area's rapid implementation of the Nanjing Agreement. However, many residents in the riverbed are still unable to relocate and are crying out for relief. Mr. Yan Zhenxing of the Water Resources Commission expressed deep sympathy, and stated in his personal capacity that the Executive Yuan should be urged to promptly allocate relief funds. Mr. Todd and Mr. Zhang Jichun stated that upon their return to Bian, they would immediately urge surveying personnel to bring instruments and engineering equipment to Heze as soon as possible to begin work. Mr. Todd, Mr. Zhang, and Mr. Yan returned to Bian on the afternoon of the 2nd. Representatives Wang Xiaoyi and two others from the Liberated Area accompanied them to Nanjing to continue discussions with UNRRA and the Executive Yuan regarding relief and supply issues. UNRRA personnel and the Executive Yuan's working team remained stationed in Heze to handle transportation and supply work.
