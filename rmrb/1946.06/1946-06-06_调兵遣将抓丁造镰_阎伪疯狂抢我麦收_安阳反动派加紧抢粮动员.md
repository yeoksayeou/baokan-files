[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] On both the Zhengtai and Tongpu lines, Yan's puppet troops in various areas have undergone ten days to half a month of wheat-grabbing training. They have forcibly organized residents as young as fifteen in their controlled areas into wheat-grabbing transport teams, those aged fifteen to fifty into wheat-grabbing work teams, and those over fifty into home-guarding teams. Their plan is that the "self-defense force" will cut wheat within five li around their strongholds, seize wheat from entrenched positions within ten li, and have large units seize wheat beyond ten li. Yan Xishan has also given special training to his surplus military officers in special operations, combining special agent organizations with traitors, local bullies, and hoodlums to form small armed "Revenge and Struggle Groups" to infiltrate our liberated areas in advance and burn any wheat that cannot be seized. According to reliable information: Yan's puppet troops in Quwo city have concentrated all blacksmiths to forge more than 18,000 sickles, and Yan's puppet troops in Linfen have prepared more than 20,000. They are also issuing weapons to most of the people, preparing that at the time of the wheat grab, large units will be投入to the wheat grab, with a small number of troops forcing the people to stand guard and defend strongholds.

Wang Jingguo, the 61st Military Commander, personally deployed the wheat-grabbing work in Pingyao on May 19. During the general mobilization of the entire army, he said: "The wheat harvest is a matter of life and death for us. We must drive away or eliminate the Eighth Route Army in the wheat-producing areas. Before the wheat harvest, we must use all our strength to control the key points of the wheat-producing areas on both sides of Tongpu." In late May, Yan's troops along the Tongpu line launched a full-scale offensive against the liberated areas, invading Hongshan and Zhangliang in Jiexiu, and Jingsheng in Lingshi. Yan's troops who invaded Hongshan and Zhangliang went out every day to seize labor and grain. On May 28, more than 200 Yan's troops from Hongshan invaded Mogou and seized more than 500 jin of wheat. On the 30th, they invaded Jiaosi and arrested twelve young men. Currently, more than 1,000 young men who have been arrested have been concentrated in Jiexiu city, preparing to drive them to grab wheat.

Two hundred members of the Fenxi "Love the Country Regiment" were transferred to Huoxian on May 27. On the 29th, they ambushed Yadi Village (twenty li east of Huoxian) and arrested twelve villagers and brought them back to the city as "hostages", forcing their families to hand over one shi of wheat per person for ransom. Xiamotou Village, with fewer than thirty households, was levied three hundred shi of wheat.

On May 30, more than 30 Yan's troops from Libao, Hongtong, went to Shucun to loot. Students from the Third Joint Middle School in the city were each issued a sickle and forced to cooperate in the grain grab.

Yan's troops in Wenxi seized three large carts of wheat outside the north gate on May 29. On the 31st, more than 100 Yan's troops went to the west and south of the city to grab wheat, and Yan's troops on the city walls constantly shot at farmers harvesting wheat outside the city with rifles.

[Another Dispatch] On the 24th of last month, the Kuomintang army in Anyang created "refugee petitions" and posted slogans and catchphrases containing serious military conspiracies all over Anyang City, such as "Request the National Army stationed in Anyang to advance westward and northward to suppress the communist bandits, so that the refugees can return to their hometowns to harvest wheat," "Request the government to quickly send troops to recover the coal-producing areas," "Please the Anyang government telegraph the central government to mobilize large troops to support the communist suppression in the north," etc., attempting to create public opinion mobilization for a large-scale grain-grabbing war.

    阎伪疯狂抢我麦收
    安阳反动派加紧抢粮动员
    【本报特讯】正太同蒲两线阎伪各地部队均已经过十天到半月的抢麦训练，并强编其统治区十五岁的居民为抢麦运输队，十五岁以上五十岁以下为抢麦工作队，五十岁以上为看家队，计划其据点周围五里内由“自卫队”割，十里内扎据点抢，十里外由大部队抢。阎锡山又将其编余军官受特务训练，结合特务组织与汉奸、恶霸地痞，组成“复仇奋斗团”的小型武装，预先打入我解放区将抢不完的麦子放火烧毁。据确息：曲沃城内阎伪已集中所有铁匠打成镰刀一万八千余把，临汾阎伪准备好两万余把，并发给人民大部武器，准备在抢麦之时，大部队投入抢麦，以少数部队强迫老百姓，放哨守据点。
    六十一军事长王靖国，五月十九日亲于平遥布置抢麦工作，在进行全军动员时说：“麦收是我们的生死斗争，要把产麦区的八路军驱走或消灭，在麦收前，必须用全力控制同蒲两侧产麦区的要点”。五月下旬，同蒲沿线阎军即向解放区展开全面进犯，侵占介休之洪山、张良、灵石之静升等地。侵占洪山张良之阎军，每日四出抓丁抢粮。五月二十八日，洪山阎军二百余人进犯磨沟即抢麦五百余斤，三十日进犯焦寺抓去壮丁十二人，现介休城内已集中被抓来之壮丁一千余人，准备驱使抢麦。
    汾西“爱乡团”二百余人，五月二十七日调至霍县，二十九日偷袭鸭底村（霍县东二十里）将村民十二人抓回城内为“人质”，迫令其家属每人缴回赎小麦一石，不满三十户之下磨头村，被征小麦达三百石。
    五月三十日，洪洞李堡阎军三十余人到蜀村抢劫，城内第三联中学生每人发给镰刀一把，强迫其配合抢粮。
    闻喜阎军于五月二十九日在北门外抢走小麦三大车，三十一日阎军百余人又到城西、城南抢麦，城上阎军并不断以步枪射击城外割麦农民。
    【又讯】安阳国民党军于上月二十四日，制造“难民请愿”，在安阳城到处张贴含有严重军事阴谋的标语口号，如“请求驻安阳之国军向西向北进剿共匪，使难民回乡收麦”，“请求政府急速派军队收复产煤区”，“请安阳政府电请中央调动大军北上支援剿共”等，企图以此制造大规模抢粮战的舆论动员。
