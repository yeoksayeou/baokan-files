　　Soviet New Era Magazine Publishes Editorial
    Exposing War Provocateurs Opposing the Soviet Union
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: Moscow Radio reports that the New Era magazine's 12th issue editorial points out that certain authorities in major powers are attempting to undermine the collaborative action of major powers in handling international affairs during wartime, and to force other countries (including the Soviet Union) to submit to their will. It is no coincidence that new war provocateurs are now working to oppose the Soviet Union. For international reactionary forces advocating aggression, the existence of the Soviet Union is the biggest obstacle on the road to realizing their dark imperialist conspiracies. The Soviet Union thoroughly exposes all attempts against peace. In order to guarantee peace and security, the Soviet Union resolutely advocates cooperation between major powers.

　　苏联新时代杂志发表社论
    揭露战争挑拨者反对苏联
    【新华社延安二十日电】莫斯科广播，新时代杂志第十二期社论指出，各大强国的某些权威人士，它们企图破坏各大强国在战时对于处理国际事务之协同行动，强迫其他国家（包括苏联）服从其意志。现在新的战争挑拨者，正努力反对苏联，这绝不是偶然的。对于主张侵略的国际反动势力，苏联的存在，是他们实现黑暗帝国主义阴谋途程上的最大障碍。苏联对一切反对和平的企图，给予彻底的揭破。苏联为保证和平与安全，坚决主张各大强国之间的合作。
