　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Prague dispatch: The Czechoslovak National Assembly, with 298 members, unanimously re-elected Beneš as President of Czechoslovakia. Beneš came from a farming family. After meeting his teacher Masaryk at Charles University, they jointly engaged in the movement to establish an independent republic, seeking to break away from the rule of the Habsburg dynasty. On October 28, 1918, the National Committee was established, announcing the founding of the Czechoslovak Republic. In 1929, he served as the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister, and in 1935, he succeeded Masaryk as President. In 1938, when the Nazis occupied Czechoslovakia, he immediately went into exile abroad. During the war, he maintained contact with domestic resistance organizations and organized the Czech army to engage in resistance. Beneš has consistently advocated friendship with the Soviet Union. In December 1943, he signed a treaty of friendship, mutual assistance, and post-war cooperation with the Soviet Union. He was formerly a leader of the left wing of the Socialist Party.
