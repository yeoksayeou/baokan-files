Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd - According to reliable sources: The number of Japanese troops retained by the Shanxi Kuomintang authorities in various locations to serve as the vanguard in the civil war, whose locations have been confirmed, is over 5,000. Their distribution is as follows: Datong has 2,000 Japanese troops, including over 1,000 from the 8th Special Regiment, over 300 from the Japanese Special Service Battalion under the command of Jiao Keming, and over 600 Japanese instructors and technicians, stationed in the city and Xiawangzhuang, north of the city. The Japanese Special Service Battalion stationed in Yangquan Town on the Zhengtai Railway has over 1,200 troops, with Fujita Yushin as the battalion commander. Yuci is stationed with a Japanese engineering battalion (reorganized from the 229th Battalion of the Japanese Independent Infantry 10th Brigade), approximately 1,000 troops. The Japanese Officers Training School in Taiyuan has already recruited over 200 Japanese officers above the rank of sergeant and is continuing to recruit. Qingyuan originally had a part of the Japanese 227th Battalion, about 60 troops, stationed there. On the 14th of last month, 200 more troops were added. The next day, they cooperated with the 71st Division of the Yan Army to invade and occupy Beige Town (20 li north of Xugou). Yuanping is stationed with over 150 Japanese troops. The Japanese "Nishimura Hospital" stationed in Bancun near Yuanping sent over 10 staff members to Guoxian on the 14th of last month. Taigu is stationed with the Japanese Takasaki unit, about 200 troops. There are over 30 Japanese troops in the pseudo-Duan Chengyu unit in Shuoxian. There are also over 30 Japanese troops in Pingyao. The total above is over 5,000 troops. In addition, Japanese units such as Inoue's unit are stationed in Jiaocheng, Jiexiu, Qixian, and other counties, which are not included in the calculation. The Shanxi authorities are aware that they cannot conceal the large-scale retention of Japanese troops. When the Datong Executive Group arrived in Fengzhen on May 17th, Colonel Michael, the U.S. representative, openly revealed that Chu Xichun admitted that there were still 600 to 700 Japanese troops in Datong (the actual number is far more than this), but they were all "technical personnel," and so on. Gan Siqi, Director of the Political Department of the Jin-Sui Military Region of the Communist Party of China, immediately asked: "Why does Datong need so many Japanese 'technical personnel'?" causing a burst of laughter. Four Japanese soldiers, Kishimoto Akira, Okamoto Sueharu, and others, who fled from the vicinity of Kouquan in the Yan area to the Liberated Area to surrender, also unanimously proved the conspiracy of Yan Xishan to rely on Japanese troops to carry out the civil war in their answers to the inquiries of the representatives of the Executive Group based on their personal experiences, causing the faces of the representatives of the Nationalist Party to turn red.

    山西国民党当局
    留日军充内战先锋
    已查明驻地者在五千人以上
    【新华社延安二日电】据确悉：山西国民党当局留置各地充当内战先锋之日军，已查明位置者，在五千人以上。其分布情形如下：大同有日军二千人，计特务第八团千余人，焦克敏指挥下之日特务营三百余及日军中之教官技术人员等六百余，分驻城内及城北之下旺庄等地。驻正太路上之阳泉镇日特务大队一千二百余人，大队长为藤田雄信。榆次驻日军一个工程大队（为日军独立步兵第十旅团二二九大队所改编），约千余人。太原日军士官训练学校，已招收日士官以上军官二百余人，仍在继续招收中。清源原驻有日军之二二七大队一部六十余人，上月十四日，又增来二百余，次日曾配合阎军七十一师侵占我北格镇（徐沟北二十里）。原平驻有日军一百五十余。驻原平附近班村之日军“西村医院”，上月十四日有工作人员十余人开往崞县。太谷驻有日军高崎队约二百余人。朔县伪段成玉部，内有日军三十余。平遥亦有日军三十余。以上共计五千余人，此外交城、介休、祁县等县，尚驻有日军井野等部未计算在内。山西当局对于大量留用日军，亦自知无可隐讳，五月十七日大同执行小组抵达丰镇时，美方代表麦克尔上校公开透露，楚溪春承认大同现仍有日军六七百人（按实际远不止此数），但均系“技术人员”云云。中共晋绥军区政治部主任甘泗淇当即发问道：“大同为什么要那么多日本‘技术人员’呢”？引起哄堂大笑。从阎区口泉附近逃来解放区投诚之日军士兵岸本明、冈本季治等四人，在答复执行小组诸代表询问时，亦以其亲身经历，一致证明阎锡山借重日军进行内战之阴谋甚详，使得国方代表面红耳赤。
