Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th -- Tokyo Dispatch: The Allied Council for Japan held a special meeting on the 17th to discuss the Japanese land reform issue. Prior to the meeting, Soviet representative Derevyanko and British representative Ball had proposed suggestions that conflicted with the plan formulated by the Japanese government. The plan proposed by the Japanese government, based on MacArthur's directive, stipulated that landlords owning more than two cho (one cho equals 15 Chinese mu) would voluntarily sell their land on the market. Obviously, this plan could not achieve land reform. In Derevyanko's proposal, it was demanded that the Japanese government forcibly confiscate the land of "absentee landlords" (i.e., parasitic landlords living in cities and indulging in pleasure) and establish a land fund to provide loans to farmers to purchase land from landlords residing in rural areas. It was stipulated that landlords could not own more than three cho of cultivated land, and the remaining land would be transferred to farmers with compensation. It was also stipulated that the land leased by landlords could not exceed one cho. The British representative, on the other hand, supported the Japanese government's plan.
    After a fierce debate, the Soviet representative's proposal was rejected. American representative Atcheson read a statement described by the Associated Press as "already written," saying that if the Soviet Union confiscated the land of absentee landlords and helped farmers purchase the land of landlords residing in rural areas, it would be violating the sacred right of private property. Finally, a compromise plan proposed by British representative Ball was passed, stipulating that the state would purchase tenant-cultivated land and sell it to tenant farmers, limiting the rent. The land would be owned by the farmers after two years.

　　盟国对日委员会开会
    讨论土地改革问题
    通过英方代表折衷方案
    【新华社延安十八日电】东京讯：盟国对日委员会，于十七日召开特别会议，讨论日本土地改革问题。在会议以前，苏联代表德勒维扬科，和英国代表泊尔，曾提出与日本政府所订方案相冲突的建议。日本政府所提的方案，是根据麦克阿瑟的训令，规定拥有两町步以上（每町步合中国十五市亩）的地主，自动将土地在市场出售。显然这种方案是不能达到土地改革的。在德勒维扬科的建议中，要求强迫日本政府没收“不在地主”（即住在都市纵欲享乐的寄生地主）的土地，和建立土地基金，以便贷款给农民购制在乡地主的土地。规定地主拥有耕地不能超过三町步，其余土地有代价地交给农民。并规定地主出租的土地，不得超过町步。而英国代表，则支持日本政府的方案。
    经过一番剧激辩论之后，苏联代表的建议竟遭否决，美代表艾其森，宣读被合众社描写为“已经写好的声明”，说苏联如没收不在地主和帮助农民购置在乡地主的土地，是侵犯神圣的私有财产权。最后通过英代表泊尔的折衷方案，规定由国家收买佃耕的土地，并卖给佃农，限制租额。在二年之后归农民所有。
