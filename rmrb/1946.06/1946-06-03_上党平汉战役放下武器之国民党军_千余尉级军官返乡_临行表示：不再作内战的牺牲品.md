	Kuomintang Soldiers Who Laid Down Their Arms in the Shangdang-Pinghan Campaign
	Over a Thousand Company-Grade Officers Return Home
	Expressing Before Departure: No Longer Sacrifices in the Civil War
	[Our dispatch] Over a thousand Kuomintang company-grade officers who laid down their arms in the Pinghan and Shangdang campaigns arrived at the Military and Political University of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region in November of last year to study in a specially established officer training team. For more than five months, thanks to their efforts and the help of comrades from the Military and Political University, they achieved excellent results, clarified the future of China's peace and democracy, and expressed infinite indignation at the Kuomintang reactionaries for launching a civil war and driving them to be sacrifices in the civil war; they particularly expressed sympathy and admiration for the democratic and free life of the people in the liberated areas and the emancipation movement of the masses in the liberated areas. On the 14th of last month, the school held a grand farewell party to send them back to their units or their hometowns. At the meeting, the letter of condolence from the leaders Liu and Deng was first read out. The letter highly praised their academic achievements after coming to the Military and Political University, expressed concern and sympathy for the suffering they had suffered in the civil war, and earnestly exhorted them to strive for peace and democracy when they returned. Finally, the officer representatives spoke one after another, unanimously expressing their response to the call of the military region leaders. Officer representative Zhang Enmao (formerly a lieutenant platoon leader of the 8th company of the 1st regiment of the 49th division of the Yan army) expressed three points on behalf of all officers: First, after returning, we will work hard for peace and democracy and not be sacrificed in the civil war. Second, we will learn from Xu Shu in the Three Kingdoms period and not work for Cao Cao (the Kuomintang reactionaries). Third, we will be a living Xinhua Daily, faithfully introducing the situation in the liberated areas. They departed on May 22nd. The school issued new clothes and travel expenses to each person, and the local people sent them off with gongs and drums. Along the way, cadres personally took care of their food and lodging and escorted them out of the territory. When saying goodbye, they couldn't help but burst into tears, reluctant to leave.

    【本报讯】平汉、上党两战役中，放下武器之国民党尉级军官千余人，于去年十一月到达晋冀鲁豫军区军政大学特设之军官队学习。五个多月来，由于他们的努力和军政大学同志的帮助，得到优良成绩，明确了中国和平民主的前途，对国民党反动派之发动内战，驱使他们作为内战的牺牲品，表示无限愤慨；对解放区人民的民主自由生活及解放区群众翻身运动，尤表同情与羡慕上月十四日，学校召开盛大的欢送会，欢送他们返部或返乡。会上首先宣读了刘、邓诸首长的慰问信，信中盛赞他们来军政大学后的学习成绩，对他们在内战中所受痛苦，表示关心与同情，并谆谆勋勉他们回去要为和平民主而奋斗。最后军官代表纷纷讲话，一致表示响应军区首长们的号召，军官代表张恩茂（原阎军四九师一团八连中尉排长）代表全体军官表示三点：一、回去后，为和平民主努力，不作内战的牺牲品。二、学习三国时的徐庶，不给曹操（国民党反动派）办事。三、作活的新华日报，忠实的介绍解放区情形。五月二十二日启程，校方发给各人新衣路费，驻地群众打着锣鼓相送，沿途并由干部亲自照顾食宿，护送出境。握别时，都不禁潸然泪下，恋恋不舍。（花淳）
