    American Anti-Labor Laws
    During Roosevelt's presidency, the U.S. Congress passed the Labor Relations Act in 1935 (generally called the Wagner Act, named after Senator Wagner, who proposed it), granting workers the rights to organize unions, strike, and engage in voluntary arbitration. Following the development of worker power, some congressional representatives of the big bourgeoisie, in order to suppress the labor movement, successively passed the following anti-labor bills:

    (1) Case Bill: Proposed by Republican Congressman Case, it was passed by the House of Representatives on February 7th by a vote of 258 to 155. The bill stipulated the establishment of a Federal Arbitration Board under the Department of Labor to interfere in labor disputes. During the 60-day "cooling-off period" intervened by the arbitration board, workers were not allowed to strike, and those who went on strike or supported strikes would be subject to heavy fines and imprisonment. This bill completely violated the Wagner Act of 1935 (i.e., the Labor Relations Act) and the U.S. government's tradition regarding the labor movement. Therefore, the Congress of Industrial Organizations denounced it as the most egregious anti-labor bill in the history of the U.S. Congress. The central purpose of this bill was clearly to prohibit striking workers from receiving social assistance and to deprive workers of the rights they had gained under the Wagner Act. Recently, under worker pressure and the opposition of 77 members of the House, Truman vetoed the bill, and the House has also agreed to the veto.

    (2) Truman's "Cooling-Off Period" Bill, which has been passed by both the House and Senate. According to this bill, workers are required to have a 30-day "cooling-off period" before striking, during which they cannot strike but must wait for a fact-finding board to investigate the dispute and make recommendations for resolution. This deprives workers of the right to choose a favorable time to strike. CIO President Murray denounced the bill as effectively abolishing workers' right to strike.

    (3) The Bailey Bill, which stipulates that after the war, the government must return to factory owners the excess profits taxes they paid during the war. This allows factory owners to maintain profits even if they close their factories, thereby helping them to engage in anti-strike activities.

    (4) Strike Conscription Bill, passed by the House last month and amended and passed by the Senate. The content of the bill is as follows: 1. In the event of a work stoppage in factories or other industries that endangers the national economy, the president may declare a state of emergency; 2. The president may then set a deadline for resumption of work and determine wages and working conditions during the period of government takeover; 3. Company employees and union members who do not cooperate may be fined up to $5,000 and imprisoned for up to one year; 4. Individuals who instigate strikes or slowdowns during the period of government takeover will lose their employment status; 5. Federal prosecutors may order federal district courts to enforce government orders to resume work; 6. Strikers will be conscripted into military service during government takeover; 7. After compensating owners for losses incurred during the period of government operation, net profits will be transferred to the Treasury. The Senate has deleted items (1), (3), (4), (6), and (7) and passed the bill.

    (5) Restriction of Strikes Act, passed by the Senate and passed by the House of Representatives on the 29th of last month. This bill was also proposed by Truman. It stipulates: 1. Prohibit any union leader from encouraging or inciting workers to strike; 2. Workers who persist in striking without justification should be deprived of their right to strike; 3. Employers and union leaders who violate the regulations should be subject to criminal penalties. This bill not only deprives workers of the right to strike but also imposes criminal penalties. It is no wonder that Murray said it attempts to repeal the anti-slavery amendment in the U.S. Constitution.

    In addition, Truman has also used the government's military takeover to suppress workers' strikes based on wartime emergency powers. The current railway workers' strike is due to Truman's guarantee of government takeover of the railways, which has strengthened the employer's position, resulting in a failure to reach a reasonable solution in negotiations.

    American workers have awakened and have warned against Truman's actions to suppress strikes. Truman's veto of the Case Bill was the result of pressure from workers and New Deal members of Congress.

    美国反劳工法案
    在罗斯福执政时期，美国国会在一九三五年通过了一个劳工关系法（一般叫做华格纳法案，因其系参院民主党议员华格纳所提出而得名），给工人以组织工会、罢工及自愿仲裁等权利之后，由于工人力量之发展，一部份大资产阶级的国会代表，为了压制工人运动，曾先后通过了下述一些反劳工的法案：
    （１）凯斯法案：由共和党众议员凯斯提出，于本年二月七日由众院二五八票，对一五五票通过。该法案规定于劳工部下设联邦仲裁局，以干预劳资纠纷，在仲裁局干与的六十天“冷静时期”，工人不得罢工。并对工人罢工及支持罢工者，处以巨额罚款及徒刑处分。此一法案，完全违反一九三五年之华格纳法案（即劳工关系法），及美国政府对劳工运动之传统。故产业工会联合会斥之为美国国会历史中最恶劣之反劳工法案。此法案之中心目的，显在禁止罢工工人获得社会援助，剥夺工人在华格纳法案下所获得之权利。最近在工人压力及众议员七十七人反对下，杜鲁门遂对该案予以否决，众院亦已同意否决。
    （２）杜鲁门“冷静时期”法案，已经参众两院通过。根据此一法案，工人罢工前，需有三十天“冷静期”，即在此时期中，不得罢工。静候事实调查局进行纠纷调查，提出解决建议。因此剥夺了工人选择有利时期，举行罢工的权利。产业工会联合会主席莫莱指斥此一法案，实际上取消了工人的罢工权。
    （３）巴莱法案，它规定战后政府，须将其在战时所缴过分利得税税款退回纳款厂主。这样就使得厂主虽关厂，而利润仍可保持。从而帮助他们进行反对罢工的勾当。
    （４）罢工征兵法案，上月经众院通过，参院修正通过。该法案内容为：一、在破场或其他各业，因工作停顿而危及国家经济时，总统得宣布紧急状态之存在；二、总统第二步得规定复工期限，并确定政府接管期间之工资及工作条件，三、公司职员与工会不合作者、可处以五千美元以下之罚金，及一年以下之徒刑；四、在政府接管期中，联络罢工或怠工之个人，失去雇工之地位；五、联邦检察院可下令联邦地方法院令饬执行政府之复工命令；六、政府接管中罢工工人征服兵役；七、在赔偿业主于政府经营期间的损失后，纯利转归财政部。参院已删去（一）、（三）、（四）、（六）、（七）五项，而予通过。
    （５）限制罢工法，参院通过后，上月二十九日由众院通过。这个法案，也是杜鲁门提出的。它规定：一、禁止任何职工会领袖鼓励或煽动工人罢工；二、对无故坚持罢工的工人，应褫夺其罢工权；三、对违反法规规定的雇主与职工会领袖予以刑事处分。这个法案，则不独剥夺了工人罢工权，而且竟要加以刑事上处分。无怪乎莫莱说：它企图废止美国宪法中反奴役的修正案。
    此外杜鲁门还根据战时紧急权力法案，利用政府军队接管的办法来压制工人的罢工，目前铁路工人的罢工，即因杜鲁门保证政府接管铁路而加强了雇主的地位，致不能在谈判中获得合理解决方法。
    美国工人们已经觉醒，曾经对杜鲁门的压制罢工行动，提出警告。杜氏此次否决凯斯法案，即系工人与新政派议员压力之结果。（新华社延安十三日电）
