Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. The Northeast Daily recently published an editorial: "Oppose American Imperialist Elements Helping Chiang Kai-shek Massacre the People of Northeast China." The text is as follows: Chiang Kai-shek has been waging civil war in the Northeast for a full six months. In these six months, nearly 300,000 people in the Northeast have died from the flames of the civil war; no less than 300,000 homes have been destroyed by the flames of the civil war; no less than 1.5 million people have been displaced by the flames of the civil war; and more than 15 million people have lost their jobs or are unable to engage in production due to the impact of the flames of the civil war. Chiang Kai-shek's civil war policy has placed the people of Northeast China in dire straits, suffering the tragic consequences of death, hunger, unemployment, displacement, separation of husbands and wives, and the destruction of farmland! Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the country during the "September 18th Incident," causing the people of Northeast China to suffer fourteen years of rule by Japanese fascist bandits; after "August 15th," he launched another civil war, causing the people of Northeast China to suffer the deep pain of civil war destruction! However, the people of Northeast China always remember that every weapon that has massacred the lives of the people of Northeast China and bombed the homes of the people of Northeast China was made in America. The people of Northeast China have already suffered massacres by weapons made by the Japanese, and now they are suffering massacres by weapons made by Americans. In their hundred years of experience, the Chinese people have long recognized that any foreigner who uses weapons to massacre the Chinese people is, based on our common sense, not well-intentioned. Such people are not friends of the Chinese people, but rather imperialist elements.

Today, the Kuomintang army in the Northeast is actually a Chinese army raised by Americans, because everything about it, except for its naked body, is American; they use money borrowed from the United States, wear American-made uniforms, shoes, socks, and shirts, carry American guns, use American cannons, fire American ammunition, the planes that bomb peaceful cities are made in the United States, the tanks that frantically attack the people of Northeast China are also supplied by the United States, they are transported to the Northeast by American warships operated by American sailors, and then sent ashore by American landing craft, and the port facilities are also completed with American technical guidance, and they are transported to the front lines by American vehicles. This shows that Chiang Kai-shek's civil war policy, Chiang Kai-shek's massacre of the people of Northeast China, cannot be carried out without the support of American imperialist elements. We also remember that German and Japanese imperialists helped Chiang Kai-shek fight a ten-year civil war, but they did not defeat the Chinese people, nor did they defeat the people's army led by the Chinese Communist Party, and they themselves fell. It is impossible for any imperialist element to help Chiang Kai-shek defeat the Chinese people or the people's army led by the Chinese Communist Party. Because American imperialist elements are helping Chiang Kai-shek massacre the people of Northeast China, the people of Northeast China naturally believe that the reactionary elements within the American government have imperialist ambitions in their actions in China, especially in the Northeast. However, the people of Northeast China have always regarded the broad masses of the American people and progressive people from all walks of life as their friends. If the American government does not take decisive measures to immediately stop helping Chiang Kai-shek massacre the people of Northeast China, then the people of Northeast China will use the anger they once held against Japanese imperialism to resent the imperialist elements within the American government!

    东北日报发表社论
    反对美国帝国主义分子
    帮蒋介石屠杀东北人民
    【新华社延安七日电】东北日报顷发表：“反对美国帝国主义分子帮助蒋介石屠杀东北人民”之社论，原文如下：蒋介石在东北进行内战、已经整整的半年了，在这半年中，东北人民因内战炮火而死者、将近卅万人，因内战炮火而毁去之住宅，将不少于三十万户，因内战炮火而流离失所者，将不少于一百五十万人，因内战炮火的影响而失业及无法进行生产者，将在一千五百万人以上。蒋介石的内战政策，已使东北人民处于水深火热之中，遭受死亡、饥饿、失业、流离失所、夫离妻散、田园俱毁的惨祸！蒋介石既卖国于“九一八”之时，使东北人民遭受十四年日寇法西斯的统治；复内战于“八一五”之后，使东北同胞遭受内战毁灭的深重痛苦！但是东北人民始终记得：屠杀东北人民生命、轰炸东北人民家园的一切武器，没有一件不是美国制造的。东北人民已经受了日本人制造的武器的屠杀，现在又经受美国人制造的武器的屠杀。我们中国人在一百年的经验中，早已认识，凡是用武器来屠杀中国人民的外国人，凭着我们的常识判断，都知道这种外国人不是心怀好意，这种人不是中国人民的朋友，而是帝国主义分子。
    今天在东北的国民党军，实际上是美国人豢养的中国兵，因为它除了赤裸裸的肉体是中国的以外，其他一切都是美国的；他们使用从美国借来的钱，穿着美国制的制服、鞋、袜、和衬衣，背着美国的枪，使用着美国的炮，发射出的是美国的弹药，向和平城市实行轰炸的飞机是美国制造的，向东北人民疯狂冲击的坦克也是美国供应的，他们由美国水兵操纵的美国军舰运到东北，再由美国的登陆艇送上岸，而海港设备也是美国技术指导完成的，并由美国车辆把他们运到火线。这就说明了蒋介石的内战政策，蒋介石对东北人民的屠杀，没有美国帝国主义分子的支持是无法进行的。我们还记得：德、日帝国主义者，曾帮助了蒋介石打了十年内战，并没有把中国人民打败，并没有把中国共产党所领导的人民军队打败，而他自己竟倒了。任何帝国主义分子，想帮助蒋介石把中国人民打败，把中国共产党所领导的人民军队打败，这是不可能的。因为美国帝主义分子帮助蒋介石屠杀东北人民，东北人民对于美国政府内反动分子在中国尤其在东北的作法，自然会认为怀有帝国主义的野心。但东北人民对于广大的美国人民及各界进步人士，始终认为是自己的朋友。假若美国政府不采取坚决的手段，立即停止帮助蒋介石屠杀东北人民，那么，东北人民将以过去仇怨日本帝国主义的怒火来仇怨美国政府内帝国主义分子！
