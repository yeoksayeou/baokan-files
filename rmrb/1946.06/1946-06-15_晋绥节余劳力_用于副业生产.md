Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 10th: In Jin-Sui region, due to the widespread establishment of mutual aid work teams, a large amount of surplus labor is freed up from farming and used to develop sideline production, resulting in significant profits. In the Bian Shan area of Fenyang, over 200 mutual aid work teams have been extracting labor since April, with each team sending one laborer to the mountains to fell trees. By mid-May, they had felled over 60,000 trees and distilled 1,000 catties of pine tar, yielding profits equivalent to 10 million agricultural currency units (each agricultural currency unit is equivalent to 1.2 legal currency units). In Zhongfu Yuan, 42 male laborers organized an oil mill cooperative, distilling 600 catties of pine tar and felling 2,000 trees. The women spun and wove, earning over 3 million currency units, ensuring ample food and clothing for the entire village. In Sujia Village, Jiaocheng, 140 laborers were extracted and in 20 days they felled over 20,000 trees, earning 2.5 million currency units. In the third district of Ningwu, four villages including Xiyao Hongtugou, organized wood gathering teams, earning over 2 million currency units. Xinbao Village engaged in transportation, earning 2.5 million currency units. Villages along the river in Jiade, Hequ, mostly organized cooperatives to engage in various handicraft production and transportation, etc. In Kangjiatan Village alone, they earned the equivalent of 10,000 currency units in half a year. Xing, Lin and other counties are using surplus labor to produce large quantities of fertilizer and strengthen intensive farming, expecting to increase grain production by nine sheng per hectare. In more than ten villages along the Fen River in Jing Le, such as Fengrun Xidadu, a movement to create dammed fields has been launched. Each village has established a dammed field committee to take responsibility for leadership. When there is time after farming they work on damming, and the entire project will soon be completed, transforming 13,000 mu of barren滩 into fertile fields.
