Peace and the Pancake
(Ramblings Under the Lamp, Part 1)
Siji

Ah Q said, "The world is really going to the dogs."

More than twenty years have passed, but what the Chinese fascists have bestowed upon the people in the so-called "recovered areas" is still "barter," which seems very bad. Right and wrong are indistinguishable, the nation's righteousness is unwanted, and many muddy-headed farmers are left in a state of bewilderment, unable to live or die. The Anti-Japanese War was won, but the people of Anyang cried out: "Thinking of the Central Government, hoping for the Central Government, but the Central Government coming is even worse." From being enslaved by foreigners, they looked forward to being slaughtered by their own people; from the rampant activities of traitors, they looked forward to the "National Army" running amok. The common people are born with a hard life and seem to deserve to die forever. However, the traitor Li Ying is enjoying his good fortune. In the past, he was a running dog of the Japanese, but now he is the "commander-in-chief" of the "Central Government."

The people of Yongnian feel even more pitiful than those of Anyang. The Japanese ran away, but many "Chinese people" who eat pancakes were added to the city. Xu Tieying, it is said, suddenly became a "National Army" again, under the jurisdiction of Nanjing. People are no longer allowed to call them "Imperial Collaboration Grandpas"; it seems that Nanjing and Tokyo still have differences. However, the faces they put on have not changed. Beating people, scolding people, killing people, everything is "still the same old way," except that there are two more kinds of punishments than in the "Imperial Collaboration" era. First, closing the city gates to rob people and demolish houses. Second, letting "pancakes eat people." Many people, for no apparent reason, without any crime, lost their lives in these punishments. "On the 15th of May alone, Chen Gui, the chief of the 9th Bao of South Street, and the small errand boy of the American representative of the implementation team, was crushed to death by the pancake dropped by the plane. Xu Deyan, number 12 Shuangguanmiao Street, was said to be getting married soon, but her thigh was smashed into three sections by the pancake dropped by the plane." That Bao chief Chen, dare not say that he has not done anything wrong, maybe "the number of days is fixed," "deserved it," but that Xu Deyan—a girl who has never been married, probably would not "disobey military orders" and attack the "National Army," why should she be punished with a smashed leg? The Anti-Japanese War was won, and to show peace, pancakes are used to smash people?

During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese people made great sacrifices. The Japanese massacred countless of our peaceful residents. At that time, everyone thought: "Bear with it, one day, we will win, and it will be better." Countless hearts pinned their hopes on the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. But victory has arrived, and the people of Yongnian City have been "smashed to death by peaceful airplanes with pancakes, more than twenty of them. What is this for?"

The fascist propagandists in Beiping are shouting loudly every day that the "National Army" in Yongnian is "trapped" and "attacked," but the "National Army" is still "staunch" and "protecting" the people—I really don't know that there is such a thing as shame in the world! Don't you think that Xu Deyan's leg was broken by your "protection," and she was only carried to the liberated area outside the city for treatment on May 17th?

Soap bubbles cannot be used as basketballs, and facts written in blood cannot be smeared with ink. Fascist propagandists, wake up and wash your faces, you have deceived the people enough! The Chinese people have already opened their eyes!

    和平与大饼
    （灯下漫谈之一）
    思基
    阿Ｑ说：“如今的世道真不成个样子了。”
    话说至今，已经二十多年，但中国法西斯分子恩赐给所谓“收复区”老百姓的，仍旧“以物易物”，显得很糟。忠奸不分，民族正气不要，把许多泥头庄稼汉，弄得啼笑皆非，死活不能。抗战胜利了，安阳人叫着：“想中央，盼中央，中央来了更遭殃。”从外国人奴役，盼来了本国人屠杀，从汉奸横行，盼来了“国军”逞凶。老百姓生就了一条苦命，似乎就永远该死。汉奸李英却大享其福，过去是日本人的走狗，现在却是“中央”的“总司令”。
    永年人比起安阳来就更觉可悲。日本人跑了，城里可添了许多吃大饼的“中国人”，许铁英，听说一下又变成了“国军”，属南京管。不准人再叫“皇协爷爷”；看样子，南京和东京还要有区别。但他们摆出的脸相，却并不见变。打人、骂人、杀人、一切“仍旧惯”，只是比“皇协”时代多了两种刑罚。第一，关着城门抢人，折房子。第二，让“大饼吃人”。许多人，不明不白，无名无罪，就在这些刑罚里面送了命。“光五月十五日就有南大街九保保长陈贵，执行小组美国代表的小听差被飞机投下的大饼碾死。双关庙街十二号的徐德颜，听说刚快出嫁，但大腿却被飞机丢下的大饼砸成了三节。”那位陈保长，不敢说他没有做过亏心事，也许“天数已定”，“罪有应得”但那位徐德颜——一个曾未出嫁的女孩子，大概不会“违抗军令”向“国军”进攻吧，为何该受砸腿之罪？抗战胜利了，为了表示和平，就用烧饼砸人么？
    抗战八年，中国人民牺牲很大，日本屠杀了我们无数和平居民，那时，每个人都想：“忍着吧，总有一天，咱们胜利了，就会好。”无数万条心，全把希望寄托在抗战胜利上。但胜利盼来了，永年城的人民，却被“和平的飞机，用大饼砸死了二十多，这是所为何来呢？
    北平的法西斯宣传家们，天天大吹大嚷，永年“国军”被“困”、被“攻”，惟“国军”仍“坚贞不屈”，“保护”人民——真不知人间有羞耻事！你们不想想，徐德颜的腿不就是你们给“保护”断了，五月十七日才抬到城外解放区来医治么？
    吹起的肥皂泡，不能当作篮球用，血写的事实，不能用墨水来涂抹，法西斯的宣传家们醒一醒，洗洗脸吧，你们已经把人民欺骗得够了！中国人民，早已睁开眼睛了呵。
