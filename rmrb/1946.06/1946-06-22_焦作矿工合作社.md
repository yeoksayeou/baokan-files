　　Jiaozuo Miners' Cooperative
    Fang De

    I. Times Have Changed
    Due to the frantic exploitation by the Japanese invaders and the continuous years of famine after 1931, farmers near Jiaozuo lost their land and fled to the mines. The enemy took this opportunity to buy labor cheaply, driving miners' wages to the lowest levels, even owing wages without paying them. By the time they surrendered and fled, they still owed 14 million yuan. Little Wang Zhong's family of eight worked continuous shifts (day and night shifts every day), yet they could not support the nine women and children in the family. When the family's hope for receiving wages turned to despair, they had to drag their skeletal bodies out to flee the famine. Some died less than four or five li from home!

    On September 9th last year, the Eighth Route Army recovered Jiaozuo. The democratic government distributed 27,840 jin of emergency relief rice to 1,605 unemployed workers, saving Little Wang Zhong and his mother from death.

    Following that, the workers fought against traitors, demanded wage increases, and achieved democracy, turning their lives around. Now their lives have greatly changed. Jiang Guoqing's family of five relies solely on his work in the mine. His eldest child manages the household and does odd jobs. Besides food and drink for the whole family, they bought two bolts of cloth last winter. For the first time, they put on new cotton-padded clothes. Their home is no longer as poor as it was when they were first liberated, when the whole family shared one quilt. Now the four beds are covered with reed mats, mattress covers, and new quilts. As of May, the family still had one stone and three dou of corn stored. When he meets people from the trade union, he can't stop smiling, repeatedly saying: "The Eighth Route Army came too late, otherwise my second child wouldn't have left. If things continue like this for another two years, we'll be fine!"

    II. The Workers' Own Warehouse – The Cooperative
    The workers' lives have improved so rapidly, not only because of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine Xinhua Co., Ltd.'s appropriate and gradual wage increases, but also entirely thanks to the miners' own warehouse – the workers' cooperative!

    In late February, Comrade Gao Qingzheng, the Labor Protection Minister of the Fourth Branch of the Taihang Federation of Trade Unions, came to the Jiaozuo mining area to establish a cooperative to ensure workers' food and clothing. The company provided a loan of one million yuan as a foundation, and after an appeal for share subscriptions, the workers responded enthusiastically, raising 300,000 yuan in just a few days. All the funds were used to buy grain, and the cooperative's storefront was thus established.

    At the beginning, they encountered wage day on March 4th. As usual, a few illegal grain merchants wanted to raise market prices. This time they wanted to crush the cooperative but instead sold at a low price. The cooperative took this opportunity to call on workers to buy at the market. When speculators doubled the price on the 6th, raising it by 20-30 yuan per dou compared to normal, the cooperative immediately released 60,000 jin. Each member only needed to buy five dou of grain to earn back the equivalent of one share (100 yuan per share). Here, workers were freed from the exploitation of grain speculators for the first time.

    Although market prices rose month by month, workers received more and more benefits from the cooperative. In March, the cooperative's grain price was 1.54 yuan lower per jin than the market price, 2.7 yuan lower in April, and 8 yuan lower in May. In total, in just three months, the cooperative reduced the workers' expenditure by 800,000 yuan on grain alone. To ensure a supply of new wheat, the cooperative sent people to grain-producing areas to order one million yuan worth of fine grains.

    Besides grain, cloth is what the workers urgently need. The cooperative purchased cheap homespun cloth to meet immediate needs, and also absorbed cotton to organize weaving. First, it provided interest-free loans of 4,000 yuan to workers' families to buy spinning wheels. The cooperative supplied cotton. Now, the 63 workers' families participating in the weaving groups earn an average of 29.95 yuan per person per day from March 2nd to May 25th, which is higher than the average income of general spinners. The cooperative also bought a cotton ginning machine. The market price for ginning is 32 yuan per jin, but shareholders and their families only pay 16 yuan, and general workers' families pay 18 yuan. Nearby farmers only pay 20 yuan per jin for ginning. They have already ginned 1,511 jin. In addition, a small weaving factory was established (with one iron loom and four wooden looms) to weave cloth themselves. The cost from buying cotton to weaving cloth is 37 yuan per foot, which is 10-20 yuan lower than the market price. The profit from the entire production process is distributed with the largest share going to the spinning process. Therefore, the 110 workers' families who have not participated in the weaving groups are also spinning with spinning wheels with the help of the cooperative.

    As a result, the workers' lives have not been affected by price changes. They often say: "Wage increases are certainly good, but relying solely on wage increases is not enough. As long as the workers can run the cooperative well and buy cheap grain and cloth, that's all that matters." Recently, they have also proposed to the cooperative to buy more wheat and less corn. To further guarantee the workers' lives, the cooperative is preparing to add an electric mill for them to grind flour to eat.

    III. It's for the Workers, and the Workers are for It
    In order to take care of all the workers in the mining area, the cooperative distributes materials to Jiaozuo, Lifeng, and Wangfeng. Regardless of whether they are shareholders or non-shareholding employees, as long as they do business with the cooperative, they can get benefits from the cooperative.

    Workers receive coal strips from the company, which is troublesome and time-consuming to exchange for coal or sell in small quantities. With the cooperative, they can send the strips to the cooperative and exchange them for money at the price. The cooperative then exchanges and sells them in bulk from the company, which the workers find much more convenient.

    As of May 25th, 18,880 employees, workers' families, farmers, and citizens have benefited from the cooperative. The share capital has increased from 1.3 million yuan to 2 million yuan, and including dividends, it has expanded to 6 million yuan.

    IV. How is the Cooperative Run So Well?
    To solve the workers' need for large quantities of grain and cloth with limited capital, and still make a profit, it is necessary to rely on organized workers to participate in this "planned economy" organization. The cooperative sends and receives statistical tables of needed materials through the trade union organization system every month, quickly understands the materials needed by workers, accurately grasps the distribution of materials and the turnover of funds, and avoids stockpiling. Sometimes the company also supports with large amounts of funds, so the business is doing very well.

    Secondly, organize a transportation system to transport materials for the cooperative, to ensure that the materials arrive at the sales location at a lower price than the general market price. For example, transporting coal from Xida well to Qinyang costs 8 jiao per jin; and transporting the grain needed by workers back from Qinyang costs 4 jiao per jin. The porters earn more by transporting both ways, and whether busy or idle, more than 90 carts transport coal for the cooperative to grain-producing areas in Bo'ai and Qinyang and cotton-producing areas in Xiuwu and Wuzhi every day, and transport the grain needed by workers back. There is also an incentive system for the transportation team: Those who can guarantee to transport goods for the cooperative regularly, do not steal coal on the road, and do not mix in gangue, and those who play a exemplary role in the team, are awarded 1,000 to 1,500 yuan per month. In this way, the cooperative's coal is weighed accurately, of good quality, and easy to sell. Grain and cotton are brought back by returning porters, so the cost is not high.

    Thirdly, plan to organize the production process of necessities, reduce intermediary exploitation, and distribute the vast majority of the profits to the workers' families participating in the production. Therefore, all workers' families participating in the production can receive higher wages than other factories, and the finished products are batched to workers at a slightly higher price than the cost, which is much lower than the market price. It has been achieved that workers and their families are working for themselves, and have also developed their own careers!

    Fourthly, reduce expenses and ensure the highest degree of profit. Adopt a lean policy for the cooperative organization, and many tasks rely on the trade union organization system. It also enhances the leadership prestige of the trade union among the masses. The cadres participating in the cooperative work have a high degree of political awareness and work enthusiasm. In addition to sharing dividends according to their share value of 100 yuan, their monthly wage income is less than that of the workers. They are also actively engaged in production. The president, vice president, and a cook have also opened two mu of vegetable plots in Xida well and raised 20 chickens to solve miscellaneous expenses.

　　焦作矿工合作社
    方德
    一、日子变了
    日本强盗的疯狂压榨和三十一年以后的连年灾荒，焦作附近的农民丢掉土地流亡到矿山。敌人利用这个机会，贱价收买劳动力，把工人工资压低到最低的程度，还来个欠资不发，直到投降逃跑的时候，还积欠一千四百万元。矿工小王忠家里八个人打连班（每日作昼夜两班）养不活家里的九个女人和小孩。家里人盼望发工资到绝望时，只得撑着骨头架子出去逃荒，有的离家不到四五里，就倒下来死了！
    去年九月九日八路军收复焦作，民主政府给一千六百○五个失业工人发放了二万七千八百四十斤急赈米，小王忠和他的母亲才免于死。
    接着工人们闹反奸、增资和民主，翻过身来了。现在他们的生活大大的变了，姜国庆一家五口，仅他一个人下窑，大孩料理家务，捎带打个短工，除了全家吃喝，去年冬天还买了两个布。第一次换上了新棉衣，家里已不是刚解放时那样穷得全家合盖一条被，现在四架床上铺了苇席、褥单和新被，直到五月家里还储存有一石三斗玉茭。他见到工会的人就笑得合不上嘴来，连声说：八路军来得太迟，要不，我二孩就不会走了，象这样再过两年就好啦！
    二、工人自己的仓库——合作社
    工人生活这样急剧上升，除了焦作煤矿新华股份有限公司适当的逐渐增加工资以外，那就全赖矿工们自己的仓库——工人合作社了！
    二月下旬太行职工总会四分会劳动保护部长高清正同志到焦作矿区来举办保证工人吃穿的合作社。公司无利贷给一百万元作基金，在一次征募股金号召之后，工人热烈响应，不几天就集到三十万元。把全部资金买成粮食，合作社的门面就这样撑起来了。
    一开始碰上三月四日发工资，少数不法的粮商，照例要抬高市价；这一回想要打垮合作社，却来一个低价抛出。合作社就趁这个机会，号召工人到市场上去买，等到六日投机商把价钱翻过来，每斗较平时高涨二三十元的时候，合作社一下就抛出六万斤，每个社员只需买五斗粮食就赚回相当一股（百元一股）的便宜。在这里工人第一次摆脱了粮食投机商的剥削。
    市价虽然一月比一月上涨；但工人在合作社却一月比一月得到更多的便宜，合作社三月份每斤粮食比市价低一元五角四分，四月份低二元七角，五月份低到八元，综计三个月仅粮食一项就减少了工人八十万元的支出。为了接上新麦，该社曾派人到产粮区订购一百万元的细粮。
    工人们迫切需要的东西，除了粮食就是布，合作社一面收买廉价土布满足目前要求，同时又吸收棉花，组织织布，首先无息贷款四千元给工属作纺车，合作社供应棉花，现在参加纺织小组的六十三个工属，从三月二日到五月二十五日，每天每人得到廿九元九角五分的工资，较诸一般纺妇平均收入为大。合作社还买了一架弹花机，市上每斤弹工费三十二元，股东工属只收十六元，一般工属收十八元，附近农民弹花每斤只收二十元，已经弹了一千五百一十一斤。此外，附设小型织布厂（有铁机一架，木机四架），自己织布，从买花到织成布每尺成本三十七元，较市价低十至二十元，整个生产过程的利润，以纺纱过程分配比数最大，所以还有没有参加纺织小组的一百一十个工属，也在合作社帮助之下有了纺车进行纺织了。
    这样一来，工人生活并没有因物价变动而受影响，他们常说：“增资固然好，但光靠增资也不行，只要工人自己能办好合作社，能买到便宜粮食和布就行。”最近还向合作社提出来多买麦子，少买玉茭。合作社为进一步保证工人生活，准备还增设一部电汽磨给他们磨面吃。
    三、它为工人，工人为它
    合作社为要照顾矿区所有工人，把物资分配到焦作、李封、王封地处，不论股东和非股东职工，只要和合作社打交道，都可以得到合作社的实惠。
    工人领到公司煤条，零星兑煤、零星运销，又误工，又麻烦，有了合作社，把条子一送到社里照价兑钱，由该社到公司整兑、运销，工人们感到省事得多。
    截至五月二十五日，已有一万八千八百八十个职工、工属、农民、市民得到合作社的好处，股本由一百三十万元增至二百万元，连上红利已扩大到六百万元。
    四、合作社怎样办好的？
    拿不多的本钱要给工人解决大量的粮食和布，还要有利润，这就要依靠有组织的工人参加这个“计划经济”的组织。合作社每月通过工会组织系统发收需要物资统计表，迅速了解工人所需的物资，确实掌握物资分配与资金的周转，不使积压，有时公司也以大量资金支援，所以把买卖做得很红。
    其次，组织为合作社转运物资的运输系统，以保证物资到达销售地点比一般市价低。如由西大井运煤到沁阳每斤八角；再由沁阳把工人需要的粮食运回来每斤四角，脚夫往返有运的赚钱就多，不论忙闲每天有九十多辆大车为合作社输送煤炭到博爱、沁阳产粮区和修武、武陟产棉区，转运工人所需要的粮食回来。对运输队还订有一种奖励制度：凡能保证经常给合作社运东西，路上不偷煤，不渗矸，队里起模范作用的，每月奖给一千至一千五百元，这样一来，合作社的煤秤足，质好，容易推销出去，粮食和棉花由回脚捎回来，成本也不大。
    第三，有计划地组织必需品的生产过程，减少中介剥削，把绝大部分利润分配给参加生产的工属手里，因此，凡是参加生产的工属都能得到较其他工厂为高的工资，又按成品的成本些微加成批给工人，价钱比市场上低得多。作到了工人及工属为自己劳动，又发展了自己的事业！
    第四，减少开支，保证利润到最高度。对合作社组织采取精干政策，很多工作依托工会组织系统进行。还附带增强了工会在群众中的领导威信，参加合作社工作的干部，有着高度政治觉悟和工作热情，他们除按身股一百元分红外，每月工资收入不及工人收入大，他们还积极生产，正副社长和一个伙夫在西大井还开了两亩菜地，养廿只小鸡，解决杂项开支。
