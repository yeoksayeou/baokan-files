    Let's All Be Active Workers and Correspondents!
    Zhang Jichun
    If the newspaper is to truly become a "collective propagandist and organizer," it must establish extensive communication work. That is to say, many comrades must serve as newspaper correspondents. The so-called "the whole Party runs the newspaper," "the whole army runs the newspaper," or "everyone runs the newspaper" means that everyone should care about the newspaper, write articles for the newspaper, and be a correspondent. Comrades from all aspects of Party, government, military, civilian, and academic work should introduce the situations and experiences they encounter in their work in a concrete and vivid way for everyone to learn from and refer to, and to educate everyone. This is serving the newspaper and actually serving the work. Everyone is an active worker, a brave fighting soldier, and also an active correspondent. In this way, our newspaper will definitely be run well, and our work in all aspects will definitely be done well. In this way, the newspaper will truly play the role of "collective propagandist and organizer."

    大家来做个积极的工作者和通讯员！
    张际春
    报纸要真正成为“集体的宣传者与组织者”，就必须要建立广大的通讯工作才可能，这就是说：要有很多的同志来作报纸通讯员的工作。所谓“全党办报”“全军办报”或“大家办报”，也就是说大家要来关心报纸，替报纸写稿，作通讯员。党、政、军、民、学各方面工作的同志，大家把他工作过程中所遇到的情况，和经验具体生动的介绍出来，给大家学习参考，教育大家，这是替报纸服务，实际是替工作服务；大家是个积极的工作者英勇斗争的战士，同时也是个积极的通讯员，这样我们的报纸就一定会办好，我们各方面的工作也一定会作好；这样报纸就真正起了“集体宣传者与组织者”的作用。
