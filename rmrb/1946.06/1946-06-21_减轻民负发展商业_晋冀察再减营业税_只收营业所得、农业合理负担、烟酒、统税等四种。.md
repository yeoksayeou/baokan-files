　　Reducing People's Burden to Develop Commerce
    Jin-Ji-Cha Further Reduces Business Tax
    Only Collecting Four Types: Business Income, Reasonable Agricultural Burden, Tobacco and Alcohol, and Unified Tax.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 14th] The Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee has decided to further reduce business tax rates. The new tax rates have been generally reduced by more than one-third compared to the previous ones, covering 75 types of industries. Industries such as mining, textiles, and wool, which are vital to the daily lives of the masses, have now been completely exempted. Industries such as iron making, oil pressing, matches, leather, flour, and shoes have been revised from the original tax rate of 10/1000 to 5/1000 to 7/1000. In the sales industry, industries such as grain, firewood, charcoal, oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar have been revised from the original tax rate of 20/1000 to 7/1000. In the contracting industry, industries such as shoe nailing, clothing, laundry, and electrical repair have been reduced from the original 30/1000 to between 5/1000 and 10/1000. The new tax rates also carefully consider the level of profit in each industry, making the burden fair and reasonable. Since the liberation of Zhangjiakou, the democratic government has abolished 47 kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies from the enemy and puppet regime, and only collects direct taxes such as business income and reasonable agricultural burden, as well as four types of taxes including tobacco and alcohol, and unified tax. The tax rate has also been greatly reduced. For example, according to the amount collected by the enemy and puppet regime in the first half of last year, it has been reduced by more than 17.2 million yuan, and the vast majority of the democratic government's financial revenue is used to develop various construction projects. In this year's city financial budget, administrative expenses only account for 23%, while other expenses such as culture, education, health, public works, production loans, and relief account for 66.6%.

　　减轻民负发展商业
    晋冀察再减营业税
    只收营业所得、农业合理负担、烟酒、统税等四种。
    【新华社张家口十四日电】晋察冀边区行政委员会决定再度减低营业税率，新税率较前一般已减低三分之一强，包括七十五种行业。凡矿业纺织毛絮等制造业，因关系群众日常生活至巨，现已全部豁免。制铁、榨油、火柴、皮革、面粉、鞋帽等业，均由原税率千分之十分别改订为千分之五至千分之七。贩卖业中之粮食、柴、炭、油、盐、酱、醋等业，均由原税率千分之廿改订为千分之七。承揽业中之钉鞋、成衣、洗染、电气修理等业，均由原千分之卅，分别减为千分之五至十不等。新税率并周密照顾到各行业利润的轻重情况，使负担臻于公平合理。张市解放以来，民主政府已废除敌伪统治时期苛杂四十七种，仅收营业所得、农业合理负担等直接税，及烟酒、统税等共四种，税率亦极度减轻。如按去年上半年敌伪征收数，即减去一万七千二百余万元，且民主政府财政收入之绝大部分，均用于发展各种建设事业方面，在今年全市财政预算中，行政支出仅占百分之二十三，其余文化教育卫生工务生产贷款救济等费用，则占百分之六六点六。
