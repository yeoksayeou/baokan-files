    Shattering the Reactionary Clique's Grain-Grabbing Claws
    Yuci Smashes Yan's Special "Progress Society"
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] Yuci, in the latter half of last month, uncovered a special agent organization of Yan Xishan aimed at attacking and sabotaging our liberated areas, the "People's Progress Society" (abbreviated as Progress Society). Its headquarters were located in Taiyuan, and the head of the Yuci branch was the notorious traitor Zhai Furong. They secretly deployed their pawns in villages along our borders to gather military intelligence and disrupt our work. Yan's army relied on them as eyes and ears for every action. Recently, as Yan's army intensified its grain grabbing, they spread ideas of peace and tranquility in the villages, numbing the masses, disrupting grain storage efforts, or threatening the masses with claims such as "If you hide grain, the incoming looters will be even more ruthless," to facilitate Yan's army's plunder. This time, the crackdown resulted in the arrest of seventeen principal criminals, and the discovery of their travel documents and proof of a secret radio station, indicating that they were recently entering the city in large numbers to hold meetings and plan a large-scale grain grab against the liberated areas.

    打断反动派抢粮魔爪
    榆次破获阎特“进步社”
    【本报长治讯】榆次于上月下旬，破获阎锡山对我解放区进攻破坏之特务组织“民众进步社”（简称进步社），其总社设太原，榆次分社头目为著名汉奸翟富荣。在我边沿村庄秘密布置其爪牙，以刺探军情，破坏工作。阎军每一行动，均赖作耳目。最近阎军加紧抢粮，他们在村中则散布太平观念，麻痹群众，破坏藏粮工作，或者“藏了粮人家来了抢掠更厉害”等威胁群众，以利阎军抢掠。此次破获，共逮捕主犯十七人，搜出其往返证件与秘密无线电台的证明他们最近正大批入城开会，布置对解放区的大举抢粮计划。
