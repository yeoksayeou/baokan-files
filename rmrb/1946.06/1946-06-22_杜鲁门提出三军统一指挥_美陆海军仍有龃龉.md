　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: Washington dispatch: U.S. President Truman submitted a bill to Congress on the 14th to unify the Army, Navy, and Air Force under a single Department of Military Affairs. The bill consists of twelve points. According to this bill, the Department of Military Affairs will have three coordinating departments: the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Each department will be headed by a non-military person, and each department will still have the power to decide its internal administration. At the same time, an International Council will be established to coordinate diplomatic and military policies and to work with the National Security Council. In addition, a Central Intelligence Agency and a supply organization will be established. However, the Navy Department still disagrees with the point that the Secretary of the Navy cannot participate in the cabinet and has no autonomy. According to "U.S. Newsweek," the U.S. Army Department submitted a plan to Congress as early as last year regarding the issue of unified command of the three armed forces, but it was opposed by the Navy Department. According to Time magazine, in April of this year, the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee passed a bill that was still unsatisfactory to the Navy. Truman's plan this time has also failed to reconcile the contradictions between the Navy and the Army.

　　杜鲁门提出三军统一指挥
    美陆海军仍有龃龉
    【新华社延安十八日电】华盛顿讯：美总统杜鲁门十四日向国会提出统一陆海空军隶属于唯一之军事部的法案，该法案共计十二点，按照此一法案，军事部下设三个配合工作部门，即陆海空军。每一部门由非军人一人负责，各部门仍有自决其内部行政之权，同时并设一国际理事会，以为调整外交与军政外交与军事政策，并与国家安全委员会配合工作。此外设一中央情报机构与供应组织。但海军部对海军部长不能参加内阁及无自主权一点，仍不同意。另据“美国新闻周刊”称：关于三军统一指挥问题，美陆军部早在去年即向国会提出计划，但为海军部反对。另据时代周刊称：今年四月，美参院军委会曾通过一法案，仍为海军所不满者，此次杜鲁门之计划，亦未能协调海军与陆军之矛盾。
