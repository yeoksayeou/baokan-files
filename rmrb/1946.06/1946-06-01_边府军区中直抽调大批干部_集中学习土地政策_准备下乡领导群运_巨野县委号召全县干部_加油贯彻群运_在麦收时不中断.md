[This newspaper's Handan dispatch] Since this spring, various regions in the border area have implemented the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses. From mountainous areas to plains, a vigorous peasant emancipation movement has been universally launched. In order to continue to implement the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses, to deeply carry out the anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement, to thoroughly implement rent reduction and interest rate reduction, to truly enable the broad masses of peasants to completely turn over economically, politically, and ideologically, and to truly fully mobilize the masses, creating a solid mass foundation for consolidating peace and the democratic movement, the Central Bureau of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region has decided to draw a large number of cadres from the military region, border government, and directly subordinate organs to form peasant emancipation teams, go to the countryside separately, and strengthen mass work in the new Jinnan District. It is reported that more than 200 cadres participating in the mass movement began to gather on the 28th of this month. The Civil Affairs Department of the Central Bureau personally presided over the event, providing short-term policy education, and then distributing them to various places near Handan to strengthen the leadership of the mass movement. Responsible comrades from various departments of the Central Bureau also personally went to the training class to give mobilization speeches. The cadres of various units participating in the training have high learning enthusiasm and are determined to serve the people, fight alongside the people, and enable the people to achieve complete emancipation.

[This newspaper's Heze dispatch] The mass movement in Juye County is being carried out enthusiastically, but because the wheat harvest is approaching, most cadres want to go home. The reasons are: 1. They believe that the common people are busy during the wheat harvest, and cadres have nothing to do. 2. They have not been able to go home during the wheat harvest for eight years of the War of Resistance. Now that there is peace, and their hometowns have been liberated, they should go back to help their families harvest wheat and solve personal problems. 3. Most of the cadres participating in the mass movement in the newly liberated areas are new cadres transferred from the old areas, and they feel that it would not hurt to go home for a visit. According to the urgency of the current mass movement tasks and the actual situation of the cadres' thinking, in order to prevent the mass emancipation movement from being interrupted, the Juye County Party Committee specially calls on everyone to continue to implement the mass emancipation movement: 1. Require all comrades to consciously refrain from going home as much as possible during the wheat harvest with a spirit of responsibility to the masses, and to work with peace of mind. 2. Individual comrades who must go home should preferably still follow the general leave system regulations and not delay at home for too long. 3. Require everyone to carefully study how to combine the grievance-airing and settlement movement with the wheat harvest, and how to prevent the mass emancipation movement from being interrupted during the wheat harvest. After the County Party Committee's call was issued, Comrade He Qianli, the secretary of the County Government, took the lead in responding enthusiastically. He had been thinking about going home three times and had already obtained permission from his superiors, but because the work tasks were important, he never went back. This time, he simply gave up his request to go home.

    【本报邯郸讯】今春以来，边区各地执行大胆放手发动群众的方针，从山地到平原，已普遍展开热火朝天的农民翻身运动。晋冀鲁豫中央局，为了继续贯彻放手发动群众方针，深入开展反奸诉苦运动，彻底实行减租减息，使广大农民群众真正从经济上、政治上、思想上彻底翻过身来，真正使群众充分发动起来，造成巩固和平和民主运动的雄厚群众基础，决定再从军区、边府、中直各机关抽调大批干部，组织农民翻身队，分头下乡，加强冀南新区群众工作。据悉：此批参加群运干部二百余名，已于本月二十八日开始集中，由中央局民运部亲自主持，施以短期政策教育，即分发邯郸附近各地加强群运领导。中央局各负责同志并亲临训练班动员讲话。参加受训各单位干部学习情绪很高，都抱定为人民服务决心，要与人民一道进行斗争，使人民获得彻底翻身。
    【本报荷泽讯】巨野县的群众运动，正在热烈的开展着，但因麦收快到，多数干部都想回家。原因是：一、认为麦收时老百姓忙，干部没啥事做。二、抗战八年，收麦时都未能到家，现在和平啦，家乡解放啦，应该回去帮助家庭收麦，并解决私人问题，三、新解放区参加群众运动的干部，大多是从老区调来的新干部，觉得自己回家探望一下，也不碍事。巨野县委会根据目前群众运动任务的紧迫和干部思想的实际情况，为使群众翻身运动不致间断，特号召大家加油继续贯彻群众翻身运动：一、要求全体同志以对群众负责的精神，自觉的在收麦时尽可能不回家，安心坚持工作。二、个别同志必须回家的，最好仍按一般请假制度规定，不要在家拖延太久。三、要求大家认真研究诉苦清算运动如何与麦收结合，如何在麦收中使群众翻身运动不致中断。县委的号召提出后，县府秘书何千里同志首先热烈响应。他已经三次想着回家，并已得到上级允许，但由于工作任务重要，一直没回去。这次又干脆放弃了自己的回家要求。
