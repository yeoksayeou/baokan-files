    With the Assistance of the Border Region Government and the Hebei Bank,
    The First Private Bank in the Liberated Area,
    Ruihua Bank, Opens Its Headquarters.
    Capitalists and Peasants Alike Enthusiastically Buy Shares; First-Day Deposits Reach 170 Million Yuan.
    [Special Interview by This Newspaper] The first private bank in the Liberated Area – Ruihua Bank – opened its headquarters on June 11th. On this day, a large building on Heping Road North in Handan was packed all day with people offering congratulations and making deposits. Well-known managers and bosses from Handan City entered the venue in droves to celebrate Ruihua's opening, receiving cordial hospitality from the hosts. Warm greetings and cheerful laughter floated through the venue. Early arrivals gradually dispersed, replaced by a continuous stream of newcomers. Inside the office, staff members were busy filling out forms. Batches of funds flowed ceaselessly between the hands of both parties. In one day, the bank accepted deposits of 176 million yuan; the number of current, demand, and time deposit accounts reached over sixty. Many people, due to the lateness of the hour, silently took their money back, planning to return the next day. According to estimates by Ruihua staff, if there had been more time, today's deposits would certainly have exceeded 200 million.
    This enthusiastic situation is by no means accidental. After the rent reduction, interest rate reduction, and Great Production Movement in the Liberated Area, the living standards of the broad masses have generally risen, and they are demanding further establishment of their own households; the urban industry and commerce of the newly liberated areas are vigorously recovering, urgently requiring circulating funds; however, due to the enemy's eight years of destruction, finance is abnormally stagnant, making the establishment of some large-scale private banks a great necessity.
    This is a social need. From the growth history of Ruihua, it can be seen how closely this private bank is integrated with the entire society. In late March, the Hebei-South Bank's district branch manager conference presented this idea to the Border Region Assembly, which was in session, and invited economic sector senators to discuss solutions, which everyone greatly approved of. Industrial and commercial figures in Handan also strongly supported it. On April 9th, financial magnate Hu Jing＠, Senator Zhang Tongxiang, Chairman of the Handan Chamber of Commerce Yang Zhenqing, and other gentlemen convened the Handan Ruihua Initiator Meeting, determining a capital of 500 million yuan and establishing a headquarters preparatory office. Branch offices in various locations were also established one after another, beginning to solicit shares. Quickly, more than 410 million yuan was subscribed.
    Currently, the Kuomintang reactionaries are frantically destroying private financial enterprises in various places. Private banks and money houses established after the Tianjin and Shijiazhuang incidents have been ordered to shut down. However, in the Liberated Area, the situation is completely opposite. The Border Region Government first actively supports the birth of Ruihua, approving its establishment and calling on all sectors of the region to enthusiastically buy shares, mobilizing its own cadres to save as much as possible. Ruihua's business policy is based on "developing deposit and loan business, developing remittances, utilizing social idle funds, and supporting industrial, agricultural, and commercial businesses." In order to enable it to develop smoothly and for shareholders to earn more money, the Border Region Government specifically authorized it to operate warehouses, buy and sell raw gold and silver, and handle foreign exchange. The Hebei-South Bank is even more devoted to helping with the establishment of Ruihua, mobilizing its entire system to promote and call for it, helping with talent and preparation. When it collects share capital on behalf of Ruihua, it even offers an interest rate of 2.5% per month. It is truly public assistance to private operation, mutually beneficial to both the public and private sectors.

    边府、冀行扶助下
    解放区第一座民营银行
    瑞华银行总行开幕
    资本家和农民都踊跃入股，第一天存款达一万万七千万元。
    【本报专访】解放区第一家民营银行——瑞华银行总行于六月十一日开幕了。这一天，邯郸和平路北的一座大楼里，整天挤满着与贺和存款的人群。邯郸市著名的经理和老板们成群结队的走入庆贺瑞华开幕的会场，接受主人的殷勤招待。亲热的寒喧和愉快的笑语在会场中浮荡着。早来者陆续散去，后继者接踵而来。在办公厅内，职员们紧张的填写单据。成批的款子在双方手中川流不息。一天的工夫，银行接受了一万万七千六百余万元的存款；往来、活期、定期存款户达六十余户。许多人因为时间晚了，默默的把款子带了回去，准备明天再来。据端华的职员们估计，如果不是时间过短的话，今天的存款定准会超过两万万。
    这种热烈的情况决不是偶然产生的。解放区经过减租减息和大生产运动，广大群众的生活水准普遍上升，他们要求进一步建立自己的家务；新解放区的城市工商业正在大力恢复，迫切要求能够足资流转的资金；但由于敌人八年的摧残，金融异常死滞，建立一些规模宏大的民营银行成为非常需要。
    这是一种社会的需要。从瑞华的成长历史中，就可以看出这个民营银行与整个社会有多么密切的结合，在三月下旬，冀南银行的区行经理会议向正在开会的边区参议会提出这个意见，并邀请经济界参议员商量办法，大家都很赞成。邯郸的工商业人士也都极力赞助。四月九日，金融界巨子胡景＠、参议员张桐祥、邯郸商会会长杨真卿等先生召集邯郸瑞华发起人会议，确定资本五万万元，成立了总行筹备处。各地分行也次第成立，开始招股。很快的认足四万万一千余万元。
    目前国民党反动派正在各地疯狂摧残私人金融事业，津、石等地事变后成立的私营银行、银号都被勒令停业了。但在解放区却是一种完全相反的情况。边区政府首先积极扶植瑞华的诞生，批准了它的立案，并号召全区各界踊跃入股，动员自己的干部尽量储蓄。瑞华的营业方针本以“开展存放款业务，发展汇兑，运用社会游资，扶助工农商业为主”。边府为了使它顺利发展，使股东们多赚些钱，并特许经营仓库、买卖生金银和办理外汇。冀南银行对于瑞华的成立更是竭力帮忙，它动员了自己整个的系统替瑞华鼓吹号召，帮助人材，帮助筹备，它替瑞华代收股金的时候，竟出到月息二分五的利息。真正是公助私营，公私两利。
