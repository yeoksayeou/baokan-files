Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 18th: Paris dispatch: The second meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers was held at 4:00 PM on the 17th, chaired by Mr. Bidault. The meeting first discussed the economic clauses in the treaty with Italy. This procedure was proposed by Molotov at the meeting on the 15th and was adopted. The Italian government stated that this was "a very friendly gesture from the Soviet Union towards Italy." In the meeting on the 17th, four of the seven economic issues were agreed upon. The remaining three will be discussed at the meeting on the 18th. The four items agreed upon were: compensation for losses of United Nations property within Italy; handling of Italian property within the United Nations; Italy's abandonment of claims against the Allied countries; and economic clauses relating to trade. The issues still in dispute are: compensation, and compensation for losses of United Nations property and Italian property in ceded territories. At the meeting on the 17th, in order to speed up the work of the conference, the Soviet delegation suggested that the draft of the Italian peace treaty be discussed separately from the economic clauses, and that the opinions of the current democratic Italian government should be consulted on the latter issue. The economic clauses have been discussed in the past, but progress has been too slow. According to TASS reports, this situation is largely due to the plans put forward by the British and American sides, which contain various different and overly harsh clauses imposed on Italy. The scale and nature of these clauses, in many cases, cannot even be accurately estimated or explained. Although some British and American agencies mostly explain the problems from a unilateral perspective, they are making a great fuss about the Soviet Union's moderate demands, while remaining silent about the many British and American demands on Italy. And it is precisely these demands that are the real reason for the many difficulties encountered in resolving the economic issues of the Italian treaty. The Soviet delegation's proposal to consult the Italian government on economic issues was opposed by the British and American delegations. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to postpone this resolution until these economic clauses in the Italian peace treaty draft, which have not yet been resolved, are reviewed again.

　　苏代表团提议经济问题
    应征询意大利政府意见
    英美代表竟反对
    【新华社延安十八日电】巴黎讯：外长会议第二次会议，于十七日下午四时举行，由贝纳斯主席。会议首先讨论对意和约中的经济条款。这一程序是由莫洛托夫在十五日会议上提出而被通过的。意政府方面表示，这是“苏联对意大利非常友好的姿态”。在十七日会议中，经济部分的七项问题中，有四项已获协议，所余三项，待十八日会议再行磋商。获得协议的四项为：意境内联合国财产损失之赔偿；联合国境内意财产之处理；意大利放弃对盟国之要求；有关贸易之经济条款。尚在争论之问题为：赔偿，割让地区联合国财产意财产损失之赔偿。在十七日的会议中，为加速会议工作，苏代表团曾建议将意和约草案与经济条款分开讨论，并且关于后一问题，应征询目前意民主政府的意见处理。经济条款，过去曾经讨论过，但进展太慢。据塔斯社报导，这一情况绝大部分是由于英美双方所提出的计划，包含有强迫加诸意大利的各种不同的与太苛的许多条款，这些条款的规模与性质，在许多情形下甚至不能确切地加以估计与阐明；虽然英美某些机关多以单方面的姿态来阐述问题，但对苏联温和的条款要求，大嚷大叫，而同时他们关于英美对意大利的许多要求，却哑口无言。而且正是这些要求，是解决意大利条约经济问题时发生许多困难的真正原因。苏联代表团所提关于经济问题应征询意大利政府意见的提议，遇到了英美代表团方面的反对。讨论的结果，决定延缓这决议，直至再重新审查意大利和约草案中迄今尚未解决的这些经济条款时再说。
