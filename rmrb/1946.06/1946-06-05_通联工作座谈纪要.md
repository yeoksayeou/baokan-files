    Summary of Liaison Work Symposium
    The news group of the Border Region Cultural Work Symposium held a special discussion on the newspaper's liaison work. Representatives from the Jilu Yu Daily, Jinan Daily, Taihang Xinhua Daily, and Taiyue Xinhua Daily participated. The preliminary summary of the symposium is as follows:

  I. Combining with Reality is the Basic Key to Doing a Good Job in Liaison Work.

    Our newspapers serve the people. Our basic policy is "the whole Party runs the newspapers." This means mobilizing all practical workers and the broad masses to participate in and support newspaper work. The most important part of this is writing articles for the newspaper. Only when everyone participates can the demands and opinions of the broad masses in the liberated areas, as well as the situations and experiences of various practical works, be reflected in the newspaper, thereby promoting and guiding practical work. However, achieving this is not easy. The broad masses and practical workers are very busy, and most of them have not participated in newspaper work or have the habit of writing articles for newspapers. Therefore, we must first help them clarify an idea: participating in newspaper work is beneficial to their own work. Taihang has gained some experience, which is that more active correspondents with some foundation help practical workers and workers and peasants write articles. Using their own experience, they dispel their concerns such as "fear of embarrassment" and "not knowing how to write." Using collective creation methods, they help them break through the first barrier of not daring to write articles. Over time, they will feel that writing articles will improve their cultural level and their ability to observe, analyze problems, and summarize work. Naturally, they will become active correspondents for the newspaper. For newspaper workers, they should try their best to make their newspapers helpful to practical work, in order to gain the attention and help of practical workers. An important aspect of newspaper workers' mass perspective lies in their attention to the manuscripts of practical workers, learning from them, and carefully handling them, because these manuscripts are generated from practice and can best reflect and promote practice. If the newspaper can widely adopt such manuscripts, it will naturally be closely integrated with practice and loved by the broad masses and practical workers.

  II. Leading Cadres Taking Responsibility, Especially Providing Specific Help

    Experience has proven that if a region's communication work does not have a leading cadre in charge, it is difficult to develop. Getting workers and peasants who are not very literate or have never written articles to write is a world-shaking event. The leadership must attach great importance to it and take responsibility seriously in order to truly promote communication work. However, leading cadres taking responsibility should not be limited to simple encouragement and calls, but should especially provide their cadres with specific help. The communication work in Licheng and Changzhi, Taihang is good, mainly because of the specific help of responsible comrades. Although the responsible comrades in counties such as ×× and ×× often called for and urged, it was difficult to achieve practical results because they could not give cadres specific methods. The specific help of leading cadres should at least include: A. Providing reporting clues, pointing out reporting priorities and leadership intentions. B. Helping to collect materials and providing necessary writing conditions (such as reading certain documents, participating in necessary meetings, and giving certain time). C. Using concrete facts that participating in reporting work can improve one's political and cultural level to clear up cadres' thinking. It would be even better to be able to help revise manuscripts and summarize experiences. Many experiences have proven that paying attention to communication work will also help and strengthen one's own leadership. In particular, comrades at the county level who are specifically responsible for communication work will become powerful assistants in discovering problems, summarizing work, and collecting materials. The method of relying on the joint office to collect materials from various sources and collectively study and write collectively, as in many counties in Taihang, is a good organizational form for communication work and is still a goal to strive for in the entire region today.

  III. The Issue of Backbone Correspondents

    The role of backbone correspondents has been repeatedly proven by the experience of Yan'an and this region as an important key to doing a good job in communication work in a region. The emergence of backbone correspondents requires the local Party committee and the newspaper to consciously cultivate them. After active correspondents are discovered in practice, the local Party committee should strengthen political education for them and provide them with the necessary convenience for interviewing and writing, while the newspaper should strengthen business guidance.

    Without backbone correspondents, it is difficult to organize a sound communication group. The initial backbone correspondents are mostly intellectuals. The newspaper should repeatedly remind them to help and unite the workers and peasants. Encourage collective creation and mutual assistance in writing. In this process of mutual help, improve the cultural level of workers and peasants and gradually integrate intellectuals with reality. Backbone correspondents should pay special attention to inclusiveness, helping workers and peasants write more on general manuscripts, while paying attention to writing comprehensive, typical and specially commissioned manuscripts by the newspaper.

    As communication work gradually deepens, many workers and peasants grow into backbone correspondents. These comrades deeply benefit from mutual assistance in writing and have a strong sense of collectivism. The newspaper should take special care of them and strengthen their business knowledge so that they gradually become the solid foundation of the newspaper.

    Taihang has discovered more than once that the communication work in the entire county has temporarily collapsed due to the work transfer of two or three active correspondents. The reasons are nothing more than: (1) Communication work has not been organized, and a communication group with backbone correspondents as the core has not been formed, and second and third active members have not been cultivated in these groups to replace these backbone who were transferred. (2) The leadership did not pay attention to developing a mass communication movement, but only satisfied with the activities of two or three backbone members to write articles. When these people left, the communication work in the entire county would also decline. It must be known that backbone cannot replace everything. Only the general manuscripts of the broad masses and the typical manuscripts of the backbone correspondents can comprehensively and vividly reflect the actual work of a region. Moreover, only by developing a mass communication movement can more backbone correspondents be cultivated and produced.

  IV. The Newspaper's Liaison with Correspondents

    Many correspondents often have a feeling that the newspaper "only asks but doesn't give." That is to say, the newspaper only gives tasks, asks for manuscripts, and asks for materials, but rarely helps. There are various reasons for this feeling, but from the newspaper's point of view, the lack of help for correspondents in the past is a shortcoming that needs to be remedied urgently.

    Now the composition of workers and peasants in the correspondents is very large, and improving the business knowledge of these comrades is an urgent problem.

    What should the newspaper do?

    A. Regularly propose interview points. It is best to be able to put forward the requirements, focus, and methods of reporting this movement in more detail before a major movement.

    B. The instructions and opinions of the Xinhua News Agency Headquarters should be sent to backbone correspondents if they are directly educational for the correspondents and can be appropriately publicized.

    C. Through some specific manuscripts, summarize the main problems, biases, advantages and disadvantages in the current report, publish them in the newspaper or print them into booklets and distribute them to the correspondents for reference. This can not only improve the correspondents, but also better complete the current reporting tasks.

    D. Specifically analyze and study some specific manuscripts, and conduct five W's education from real-world examples.

    E. Compile and print news communication example readers and give them to the correspondents.

### 通联工作座谈纪要

    通联工作座谈纪要
    边区文化工作座谈会的新闻组，曾专题讨论报纸的通联工作问题。冀鲁豫日报、冀南日报、太行新华日报暨太岳新华日报均有代表参加。兹将座谈纪要初步概括整理如下：
  一、结合实际是作好通联工作的基本关键。
    我们的报纸是为人民服务的。我们的基本方针是“全党办报”。就是动员所有的实际工作者与广大群众，来参与和支持报纸工作。其中最主要的一环是给报纸写稿。只有大家动手，才能将解放区广大人民的要求、意见，各种实际工作的情况、经验反映到报面上来，从而推动与指导实际工作。但是，要作到这一点并不是很容易的。广大群众与实际工作者都非常忙迫，他们过去大多没有参加报纸工作，给报纸写稿的习惯。所以首先必须帮助他们明确一个思想：参与报纸工作对于自己的切身工作是有好处的。太行已经获得部分经验，就是由比较积极而有些基础的通讯员，帮助实际工作者、工农同志写稿，以自己的经验打通他们“怕丢人”、“不会写”等顾虑，用集体创作的方法，帮助他们打破不敢写稿的第一关。久而久之，他们会感觉到写稿会提高自己的文化水准，提高自己观察分析问题和总结工作的能力。自然会成为报纸的积极通讯员。就报纸工作者说来，应该尽量使自己的报纸能对实际工作有所帮助，以求得实际工作者重视与帮助自己。报纸工作者的群众观念的重要一面，在于他重视实际工作同志的稿件，学习它们、慎重的处理它们，因为这些稿件是从实际中产生，最能反映与推动实际。报纸能广泛采用这种稿件，自然会和实际密切结合，为广大群众及实际工作者所爱读。
  二、首长负责、特别是具体帮助
    经验证明，一个地区的通讯工作如果没有首长负责，是很难开展起来的。让不很识得字或从来没有写过稿子的工农分子动手写稿，是一件翻天覆地的事。必须领导上非常重视，认真负起责任，才有可能把通讯工作真正推动起来。但是首长负责绝不能仅止于单纯的鼓动与号召，特别要给予自己的干部以具体的帮助。太行黎城、长治的通讯工作好，主要原因之一是负责同志的具体帮助，××、××等县的负责同志虽然经常号召、督促，却因为不能给干部指示一些具体办法，很难获得实效。首长具体帮助，至少应该作到：甲、提示报导线索，指出报导重点及领导意图。乙、帮助搜集材料，给予必要的写作条件（如阅读一定文件、参加必要会议、给予一定时间）。丙、用参加报导工作可以提高自己的政治文化水平的具体事实打通干部思想。至于能作到帮助修改稿件、总结经验就更好了。许多经验证明，领导上注意通讯工作同样会帮助与加强自己的领导，特别是县一级专门负责通讯工作的同志会成为自己发现问题、总结工作、搜集材料的有力助手。象太行许多县份依托联合办公室来多方搜集材料，集体研究集体写作的方法，是一种很好的通讯工作的组织形式，今天在全区说来还是一个奋斗目标。
  三、骨干通讯员问题
    骨干通讯员的作用已由延安及本区的经验屡次证明，是搞好一个地区通讯工作的重要关键。骨干通讯员的产生需要地方党委及报馆有意识的培养。当着积极通讯员在实际中被发现后，地方党委应对其加强政治教育，给以采访写作的必要的便利，报馆则应加强业务指导。
    没有骨干通讯员，很难组织健全的通讯小组，最初的骨干通讯员多半是知识分子，报馆应再三提醒他们，使他们很好的帮助与团结工农分子。提倡集体创作，互助写稿。在这种互相帮助的过程中，提高工农分子的文化水平，并使知识分子逐渐结合实际。骨干通讯员要特别注意涵厚，在一般稿件上多帮助工农同志写，自己则注意撰写全面的，典型的及报馆特别委托的稿件。
    通讯工作逐渐深入，许多工农同志生长为骨干通讯员，这些同志深受互助写稿的好处，集体观念较强。报馆要特别照顾他们，加强其业务知识，使之逐渐成为报纸的坚实基础。
    太行不只一次的发现过因为二三积极通讯员的工作调动而使全县通讯工作暂时垮台的现象。其原因不外：（一）通讯工作没有组织起来，没有形成以骨干通讯员为核心的通讯小组，并在这些小组中培养第二、第三的积极分子，以便代替这些调动工作的骨干。（二）领导上没有注意开展群众性的通讯运动，只满足于二三骨干的活动写稿，等这些人走了，全县范围的通讯工作也就消沉了。须知骨干不能代替一切，只有广大群众的一般稿件与骨干通讯员的典型稿件配合起来，才能全面的生动的反映一个地区的实际工作。而且只有开展群众性的通讯运动，才能培养与产生更多的骨干通讯员。
  四、报馆对通讯员的连系
    许多通讯员常常发生一种报馆“只要不给”的感觉。就是说，报馆只是给任务，要稿件，要材料，却很少帮助。这种感觉的产生当然有各种原因，但就报馆说来，过去对通讯员帮助不够，实是一亟待补救的缺点。
    现在通讯员中工农分子成分甚大，提高这些同志的业务知识，是一个迫不及待的问题。
    报馆应该作些什么呢？
    甲、定期提出采访要点。最好在一个主要运动之前，能较详细的提出报导这一运动的要求、重点、方法等。
    乙、新华总社的指示、意见，择其对通讯员有直接的教育意义且可适当公布者，发给骨干通讯员。
    丙、通过一些具体稿件，概括当前报导中的主要问题、偏向及优缺点，在报上发表或印成小册子，散发给通讯员参考。既可提高通讯员，又可更好的完成当前的报导任务。
    丁、具体的分析与研究一些具体稿件，从现实的事例中进行五个ｗ的教育。
    戊、编印新闻通讯范例读物，赠给通讯员。
