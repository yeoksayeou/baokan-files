    Yoshida Reactionary Cabinet's Food Policy
    Attempts to Obstruct Japan's Democratization
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th] The Soviet TASS news agency commented on the 15th on the Japanese Yoshida Shigeru Cabinet's "food policy," stating: The Yoshida reactionary cabinet's "food policy" is not aimed at feeding the Japanese people, but merely at better obstructing Japan's democratization and strengthening warlord rule. According to the government parties, the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party, this policy means forcing farmers to hand over even more grain after fulfilling the old plan. Yoshida calls land reform, the fundamental solution to Japan's food shortage, "secondary," thus allowing landlords to maintain their monopoly of large amounts of arable land and continue to engage in black market speculation in grain. It is well known that land reform is an indispensable part of the democratization process, one of the most important terms of the Allied acceptance of Japan's unconditional surrender. Moreover, without land reform, the food problem cannot be solved well. The Yoshida Cabinet is implementing a reactionary policy that is completely contrary to the principles of the Potsdam Declaration, while hoping to obtain food imports from the United States. The U.S. occupying authorities should have supervised the implementation of the Potsdam Declaration and their land reform instructions issued last September, but instead they listen to the declarations of the Japanese reactionaries and import food from the United States by various means, violating the policy in the Far Eastern Commission's April 24th communiqué.

    吉田反动内阁粮食政策
    乃企图阻碍日本民主化
    【新华社延安十八日电】苏联塔斯社于十五日评论日本吉田茂内阁的“粮食政策”称：吉田反动内阁的“粮食政策”，其目的不在给日本人民饭吃，而只是想更好的阻碍日本民主化，加强军阀统治。这种政策，按政府党自由党和进步党的说明，便是强迫农民在完成旧计划交出粮食之后，再缴出更多的粮食。对于解决日本粮荒的根本办法的土地改革，吉田却说是“次要的”，因而就使地主们仍保持大量耕地的独占，继续从事粮食的黑市投机。尽人皆知，土地改革是盟国接受日本无条件投降的最重要条款之一的民主化程度中不可缺的一部分。而且没有土地改革，就不能很好的解决粮食问题。吉田内阁一面实行与波茨顿宣言的原则完全相反的反动政策，同时希望取得美国的粮食入口。美军占领当局，本应该监督波茨顿宣言，以及他们在去年九月发出的土地改革指示的实施，可是他们却听从日本反动派的宣言，用各种办法自美国输进粮食，而违背了远东委员会四月二十四日公报中的方针。
