    Cadres in Political Power Should Write More Articles
    Yang Xiufeng
    "People's Daily" is the newspaper of the broad masses of people in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, and it is the propagandist and organizer of the broad masses of people in the Border Region. At present, it shoulders the great task of mobilizing and organizing all the people in the Border Region to adhere to the full realization of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, to strive for and consolidate peace, and to defend the Border Region. At the same time, it further consolidates the Border Region, promotes the movements of anti-Japanese traitors, complaining of suffering, and revenge, the rent reduction movement, the troop training and reorganization and demobilization movements, and the construction work in democracy, economy, culture, transportation, etc.; exchanges the experiences of struggle and work from the plains and mountains, so as to concentrate efforts and achieve balanced development of work. Every comrade working in the political power, in addition to obtaining work instructions from the newspaper and doing his/her job well, should also reflect his/her experiences in practical work, comprehensively or fragmentarily, to "People's Daily", so that his/her experiences can be disseminated; at the same time, he/she can absorb the experiences of others to enrich his/her knowledge and improve his/her work, that is, to better serve the people. Therefore, every comrade working in the political power should regard writing articles for "People's Daily" as one of his/her work tasks and attach importance to this work.
    At the same time, every comrade should clearly recognize in his/her mind that writing articles for "People's Daily" is for work and for serving the people. Disseminating one's own struggle experience and absorbing the struggle experience of others to promote the progress of work is the main significance of writing articles and communications. Some comrades think that they are too busy with work and cannot spare time to write articles; or they think that they cannot write articles well, so they do not write. These are all because they do not clearly understand the purpose of writing articles for work and serving the people. If one recognizes that writing articles is for work, that is, work itself, then the problem of time and the problem of writing well or not will be solved. Because it is not for showing off temporarily by writing well, but for guiding the progress of work by writing. Our cadres at all levels working in the political power should all write more articles, and reflect our own experiences and practical work experiences well in the newspaper, and organize a mass movement of writing articles for the People's Daily. The small newspapers published by the joint offices in various places should also contact "People's Daily" more, and regard it as one of the tasks of organizing articles for the newspaper. In short, we must truly achieve the task of everyone reading the newspaper, everyone running the newspaper, exchanging experiences, and promoting work.

    政权干部应多多写稿
    杨秀峰
    《人民日报》是晋冀鲁豫边区广大人民的报纸，是边区广大人民的宣传者与组织者。在目前，它担负着动员组织全边区人民，坚持政协决议的全部实现，争取与巩固和平，保卫边区这一伟大任务。同时并为进一步巩固边区，推动反奸诉苦复仇运动，减租运动，练兵及整编复员运动，及民主、经济、文化、交通等各方面的建设工作；交流平原山地各方面的斗争经验与工作经验，以便集中力量，使工作发展达到平衡。每个政权工作同志，除在报纸上取得工作指示，把自己的工作做好外，还更应将自己在实际工作中的经验，综合的或片断的反映到《人民日报》上，使自己的经验传布出去；同时也吸收别人的经验来丰富自己的知识，改进自己的工作。也就是使自己能更好的为人民服务。因此每个政权工作同志，应将为《人民日报》写稿，作为自己的工作任务之一，而重视这一工作。
    同时，每个同志应该在思想上明确认识，为《人民日报》写稿是为了工作，为了为人民服务的。将自己的斗争经验传布与吸收别人的斗争经验，推动工作前进，这是写稿写通讯的主要意义。有些同志认为工作忙繁，抽不出时间写稿；或者以为自己写不好稿子就不去写。这些都是对写稿是为工作，为人民服务的目的不明确。如果认识了写稿是为了工作，即是工作，那末时间问题，写好与写不好问题就都解决了。因为它并不因为写好能出一时“风头”，而是写了指导工作的前进。我们各级政权工作同志，应该大家多多写稿，将自己的经验与实际工作经验，很好的反映到报纸上，有组织的形成为人民日报写稿的群众性的运动。各地联合办公室出版的小报，更应该与《人民日报》多联系，作为对报纸组织稿件工作之一。总之要真正达到大家看报，大家办报，交流经验，推动工作这一个任务。
