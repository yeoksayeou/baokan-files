    Suggestions to the Post Office
    To the Editor:
    The recent postal service has been very slow. Recently, we received a letter from the troops in Xingtai. The mailing date was April 7th, the Xingtai postmark was April 8th, the Handan postmark was June 1st, and the delivery date was the morning of June 4th. This is shockingly slow. Therefore, we suggest that the responsible comrades of the Post Office carefully inspect the business of local bureaus and adjust the postal routes as soon as possible.
    Sincerely,
    The People's Army Newspaper, June 4th

    向邮政局建议编者同志：
    邮政局最近的邮递，有的非常迟慢，最近我们收到邢台部队的一封来信，发信的日期是四月七号，邢台邮戳是四月八号，邯郸邮截是六月一号，送到日期是六月四号早晨。这是惊人的迟缓，因此建议邮政局负责同志，很好的检查各地局的业务，同时尽快的调整邮路。
    此致
