Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Tokyo dispatch: The Allied Council for Japan held its fifth meeting on the 28th of last month to discuss the following issues: (1) Letters submitted to MacArthur and the Allied Council for Japan by Japanese people on the May Day demonstration. In his report on the investigation results of the letters, the U.S. representative Atcheson reiterated his anti-democratic and anti-communist stance. He falsely claimed that the May Day letters were "drafted in foreign languages" and were part of a widespread secret activity instigated by the Japanese Communist Party, and unreasonably proposed to "investigate irregular behaviors of the Allied countries in the occupation activities." The Soviet representative Derevyanko stood up and sternly refuted, stating that Atcheson's report was completely inappropriate and unacceptable. Derevyanko requested the establishment of a four-nation investigation committee to handle this issue, but it was rejected by the meeting. (2) Handling the issue of Japanese property. Derevyanko spoke out against handling the Japanese government's property before the loan issue was resolved. Derevyanko urged MacArthur to pay attention to the fact that Japan was planning to distribute government property and land to veterans and was planning to establish military-industrial groups to undermine the rural land reform plan and threaten peace. Derevyanko requested MacArthur to order the Japanese to revise the land reform program, but was also unsuccessful. The meeting adjourned without any results after discussing the reform of the Japanese police and other issues raised by the Soviet representative. It is reported that the five meetings of the Allied Council for Japan since its opening on April 5th have hardly had any constructive elements. The Allied Council was established based on the decision of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. The purpose of the two organizations, the Council and the Far Eastern Commission, is to supervise and instruct MacArthur's work in order to completely destroy the remaining Japanese fascists. However, the Americans in Tokyo deliberately distort the functions of these two organizations, believing that the Allied Council is like MacArthur's advisory body. MacArthur is like the president of the United States, and the council at most plays a role similar to that of the U.S. Congress. Therefore, if the U.S. attitude remains unchanged, the continued meetings of the council will still not have any constructive effect.

    美方保持反民主立场
    对日委员会迄无建树
    苏联各项合理建议均遭拒绝
    【新华社延安二日电】东京讯：盟国对日委员会于上月二十八日举行第五次会议，讨论了下列诸问题：（一）五一示威日人送交麦克阿瑟及对日委员会函件，美代表阿契生在对该函调查结果之报告中，重申其反民主与反共的立场。他诬称：五一节函件为“外国文字所草成”，系日共所策动的普遍的秘密活动之一部分，并无理提议“调查盟国在占领活动中之不规则行为”。苏代表德勒扬哥起立严词驳斥称：艾氏报告为完全不适当与不能接受，德氏要求设立四国调查委员会处理此一问题，但遭会议之否决。（二）处理日本财产问题，德勒扬哥发言，反对在贷款问题未解决前，即处理日本政府之财产。德氏促请麦克阿瑟注意日本正计划将政府之财产与土地分给退伍军人，并计划成立军工团体以破坏农村土地改革计划与威胁和平。德氏要求麦克阿瑟命令日人修改土地改革纲领，但亦未获得成功。此次会议，在讨论苏代表提出之改革日本警察等问题后，即无结果而闭会。按对日委员会自四月五日开幕至今为止的五次会议，几乎没有任何建设性的成分，对日委会系根据莫斯科外长会议决定成立的。该委员会与远东委员会两个组织的宗旨，在于督促指示麦克阿瑟工作，以便彻底摧毁日本法西斯残余。但在东京的美国人，有意曲解该两组织之职权，他们认为对日委员会犹如麦克阿瑟的咨询机关。麦氏有如美国的总统，而委员会至多是类似美国议会作用。因此，如美方态度继续不变，委员会之继续开会，仍将不会起有任何建设性的作用。
