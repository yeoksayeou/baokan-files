Xinhua News Agency, Yantai, 16th. The Kuomintang reactionaries have recently fabricated the lie of so-called "Communist troops attacking Qingdao," and at the same time dispatched their naval vessels, trained by the US military in Qingdao, to harass the waters off Yantai and Penglai, robbing merchants. Nearly a hundred merchant ships have been robbed, and more than twenty merchants have suffered. At 5:00 PM on the 7th, three steamships belonging to the Dongsheng Company, the "Longri" and the Tongsheng Shipping Company, the "Haishoulin" and "Jufeng No. 8," fully loaded with over 300 merchants, were shelled by the Kuomintang warship "Yongxiang" in the waters off Mount Laoye in Yantai, and passengers were robbed and captured. On the 8th, the steamship "Yuanchang" of the Yuanfeng Company, carrying more than 200 passengers, was also looted, and the shipowner Yan Luancheng was brutally beaten. On the 9th, Kuomintang warships captured more than 80 civilian ships in the sea and drove 537 passengers from four steamships onto sailing boats, while escorting 29 sailors from the four steamships and goods worth more than 43.54 million legal tender yuan away. On the same day, another Kuomintang warship and three motorboats captured four of our motorboats in the northern waters of Zhifu Island. On the 9th, after harassing Changshan Island (north of Penglai), they sailed southeast. Passengers driven from the sea have escaped safely by sailing boats. After arriving in Yantai, the municipal government and various mass organizations went to the hostels to express their condolences. Together with the managers of the four shipping companies including Tongsheng Company in Yantai, they sent a telegram to the Beiping Executive Headquarters on the 11th, requesting that the Kuomintang warships be stopped from illegally rampaging in the sea, and demanding that the Kuomintang authorities punish the criminals on warships such as the "Yongxiang," return the looted ships and goods, release the arrested personnel, and guarantee that such incidents will not occur again. These victims solemnly stated that this illegal behavior of the Kuomintang Navy is becoming increasingly rampant due to the support of the US Navy stationed in Qingdao, such as training sailors, donating warships, and joint patrols. If it is not stopped immediately, it will cause merchants to disappear from the Jiaodong sea area, and greatly affect Sino-foreign trade.

    袭扰烟蓬海面劫掠旅商
    被难客商向执行部要求惩凶
    【新华社烟台十六日电】国民党反动派近日制造所谓“共军船只进攻青岛”的谎言，同时出动其在青岛受美军训练之海军舰艇，袭扰烟（台）蓬（莱）海面，劫掠旅商。被劫商船已近百艘，遭灾商人达二十余名。七日午后五时，本市东生公司之“龙日”号及同生船行之“海寿临”号与“聚丰八”号等三艘汽船，满载客商三百余，在烟台老爷山海面被国民党“永翔”号军舰炮击，乘客横遭劫捕。八日，原丰公司汽船“源昌”号，载乘客二百余，亦被洗劫，船主阎栾城惨遭毒打。九日，国民党军舰又在海面捕捉民船八十余艘，并将四只汽船上的五三七名乘客驱上帆船，而将该四汽船之水手二十九名，及价值法币四千三百五十四万余元之货物押运逃窜。同日，国民党另一军舰及三只汽艇，在芝罘岛北海面捕去我方汽艇四只。九日，又在长山岛（蓬莱北海面）骚扰后，始向东南驶去。海面被驱乘客，已乘帆船脱险。至烟台后，市政府及各群众团体均纷至客栈慰问。彼等与烟台遭劫之同生公司等四船行经理，于十一日电北平执行部，要求制止国民党军舰在海面之非法横行，并要求国民党当局惩办“永翔”号等军舰犯罪人员，发还被劫船只货物，释放被捕人员，保证今后再不发生此类事件。这些遭难者并严正说明国民党海军的此种非法行为，由于驻青岛之美国海军对他们的支持，如训练海员、赠送舰船、共同巡逻等帮助而益形嚣张。如不即予制止，将使胶东海面商旅绝迹，影响中外贸易至巨云。
