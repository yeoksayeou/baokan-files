Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 7th: The privately-owned Xinghua Industrial Company, which has been in preparation since March of this year, is now taking shape. A shareholders' meeting will be held next month to discuss and determine business policies and elect a board of directors, officially establishing the company. This reporter recently visited Mr. Liu Zaisheng, director of the company's preparatory office, and inquired about the planning process. According to him, the first step in the preparation work was to assist the affiliated factories in inventorying and valuing assets. Because the factories suffered severe damage during the retreat of the Japanese invaders, with losses amounting to approximately 200,000,000 Border Region currency (at a rate of one Border Region currency unit equivalent to two Legal Tender currency units), the democratic government invested a large amount of capital to quickly restore and develop production, adding equipment and purchasing raw materials. Therefore, when the factories were transferred to private ownership, fair valuation was absolutely necessary to prevent this property, belonging to all the people of the Border Region, from suffering excessive losses. According to the results of the inventory, the total value of the equipment in the factories is more than 400,000,000 Border Region currency units. The second step was to concentrate efforts on soliciting shares. The total capital was set at 250,000,000 Border Region currency units, which has now been fully subscribed. At the same time, people from industrial and commercial circles have sent letters or put forward business opinions, generally believing that the focus should be on developing light industry to meet the needs of the people's economy, and gradually laying the foundation for heavy industry in the future. Mr. Liu Zaisheng also detailed the great development of the business of more than 20 factories and mines affiliated with Xinghua Company since they have been operating independently and implementing enterprise management. Taking increased production and reduced waste as examples, the Zhangyuan Tobacco Company produced 70 cases of cigarettes per day last winter, which has now increased to 120 cases. The Victory Match Company has increased production from 10 to 20 cases per day in the past to 50 cases per day now. The Xuanhua Paper Company's paper production has increased from 80 reams per month in the past to 120 reams now, and will soon reach 400 reams. The quality of the finished products from various factories is excellent and has won praise from the masses. Several factories and mines are now expanding their operations, and new shafts are about to be dug at the Lixin and Jimingshan coal mines. The Far East Rubber Company is adding machinery and rushing to manufacture a large number of rubber tires for private transportation companies. The Jianguo Smelting Company for coking coal and steelmaking is also under preparation. Mr. Liu sincerely stated in the end: "We welcome people from industrial and commercial circles outside the Liberated Areas to continue to invest and subscribe to shares here, and establish a model for the broad development of China's emerging private industry."

    为中国新兴民营工业建立楷模
    张市兴华实业公司即成立
    当前以发展轻工业为主，打下重工业基础，
    诚恳欢迎外区实业界投资。
    【新华社张家口七日电】民营兴华实业公司，自本年三月发起筹备以来，现已初具规模，下月即将召开股东大会，讨论并确定营业方针，选举董事会，正式成立。记者顷访问该公司筹备处主任刘再生氏，询其筹划经过，据称：筹备工作第一个步骤，为协助所属各厂进行盘字存估价，因日寇溃退时各厂均遭严重破坏，损失约边币二十万万元之巨（按边币一元折合法币两元），民主政府为求迅速恢复与发展生产，曾投入大量资金，添置设备与购买原料，因此在各厂转让民营之际，公平估价，不致使这一笔属于全边区人民的财产，遭受过多亏损是完全必要的，据盘存的结果，各厂设备总值约在边币四十万万元以上。第二个步骤为集中力量办理招股。总资本额定为边币二十五万万元，现已悉数认足，与此同时各实业界人士，并纷纷投函或提出经营的意见，一般均认为当前应以发展轻工业为主，以适应人民经济需要，今后逐渐打下重工业的基础。刘再生氏并详述兴华公司所属二十多个厂矿自独立经营实行企业化以来，业务有极大发展，仅以增产与减少浪费来说，如张垣烟草公司去冬每日出纸烟七十箱，现增至一百二十箱；胜利火柴公司，由过去日制成品十至二十箱，现增至五十箱；宣化纸业公司造纸由过去每月八十领现增至一百二十领，不久将可达到四百领。各厂成品质量精美，颇得群众赞誉。若干厂矿现正扩大经营，利新、鸡鸣山两处煤矿新穴，即将凿成。远东橡皮公司，正添置机器，赶造大量胶皮轮带，以供民营运输业之用。炼焦煤和炼钢的建国冶炼公司亦在筹建中。刘氏最后诚恳表示：“我们欢迎解放区外的实业界人士，继续来此投资入股，为中国新兴民营工业，建立广阔发展的模范”。
