　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 24th: Paris - The Foreign Ministers Conference has completely entered a secret phase after the 22nd. According to a report by the Central News Agency, before entering the secret state, a spokesman for the Soviet delegation stated on the 22nd that the Soviet delegation came to Paris this time determined to make the conference a success, and would even compromise to achieve this goal. Furthermore, it is reported that at the informal meeting on the 22nd, Byrnes strongly advocated holding a 21-nation European Peace Conference on July 15th and suggested sending invitations to the governments of the 21 nations immediately. Byrnes argued that if the peace conference could not be held immediately, it might conflict with the September United Nations General Assembly. Bevin supported Byrnes' suggestion, believing that the discussions of the Foreign Ministers Conference had reached the stage where opinions must be submitted to the peace conference. Molotov, however, believed that it was premature to send invitations at this time, as none of the five peace treaties had been completed. Molotov suggested that the conference should accelerate discussions. Byrnes proposed that the Foreign Ministers Conference should discuss all important issues on the 24th and reach an agreement as soon as possible. Byrnes further declared that if the Foreign Ministers Conference failed to reach an agreement on important issues, they should admit failure and let others take on this task. Bevin believed that, if necessary, the four foreign ministers should meet daily.

　　巴黎外长会议转入秘密阶段
    【新华社延安二十四日电】巴黎讯：外长会议于二十二日以后，完全转入秘密阶段，据中央社报导：在进入秘密状态之前，苏联代表团发言人，于二十二日表示：苏联代表团此次前来巴黎，决使会议获得成就，为达此目的，甚至不惜以妥协为代价。又息：二十二日的非正式会议上，贝纳斯力主于七月十五日召开二十一国欧州和平会议，并建议于目前即向二十一国政府发出请柬。贝纳斯辩称：和会如不克立即举行，则可能与九月之联合国大会相冲突。贝文支持贝纳斯之建议，他认为外长会议之讨论，已进抵必须将意见提交和会之阶段。莫洛托夫则认为目前发出请柬，未免为时过早，盖因五个和约中尚无一个业已完成。莫洛托夫建议：会议应加速讨论。贝纳斯提出：外长会议应于二十四日讨论一切重要问题，尽速获致协议。贝纳斯复宣称：如果外长会议不克对重要问题获致协议，则他们应承认失败，并由他人担任此一工作。贝文以为于必要时，四国外长应每日开会。
