　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, June 24th: Industrialists, bankers, and economists here recently spoke to a reporter from the New China Daily, unanimously opposing the Kuomintang's expansion of the civil war and demanding long-term peaceful construction. Mr. Xu Chonglin, one of the persons in charge of the China Zhongshan Factory Federation, stated: The fact that current industrial production has decreased by 80% compared to wartime under the double attack of civil war and bureaucratic comprador capital illustrates that what is urgently needed today is long-term peace, and definitely not fifteen days of peace. A person in charge of Minsheng Company stated: 89% of the company's ships were dispatched for official transport in March. If the civil war continues for another half month or a month, Minsheng Company will only collapse. Mr. Lu Zicheng, General Manager of China Industrial Company and Industrial and Mining Construction Company, said: Without peace, Chinese industry cannot compete with imperialist capital internationally, nor can it fight with special capital (referring to bureaucratic comprador capital) domestically; industrial and mining enterprises have no future. Mr. Hu Yuezhi, Secretary-General of the Sichuan Relocated Factories Federation, said: "We really cannot fight any longer. If we continue to fight, the entire social economy will collapse." Mr. Yan Gongfu, Assistant Manager of Huakang Bank, said: The civil war has caused the government's financial revenue and expenditure to be unbalanced, with 90% relying on issuing banknotes. The five hundred million US dollar fund is almost used up, and the future of finance is unimaginable. Zhu Xuefan, head of the China Labor Association, Feng Ziyuan, manager of Ruihua Enterprise Company Glass Factory, Zhang Xiguang, director of Jianghan Flour Mill, and Lu Lan’kang of Yongli Bank all unanimously told reporters: Only by permanently eliminating the civil war can China's economy recover.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 24th: Shanghai News: According to the latest figures released by Shanghai Customs, imports of foreign goods in April were twenty times the value of exports (ten times in March). Imports totaled over 8.8 million yuan, more than double the amount in March, while exports were less than 410,000 yuan, a decrease of 40,000 yuan compared to March. The trade deficit for April alone amounted to US$38.7 million. However, in 1936, the monthly trade deficit was only US$5.75 million. The trade deficit in April was already seven times higher than the figure from the year before the war. The vast majority of imports are consumer goods, even raw materials that China possesses, such as cotton imports, accounting for 60% of the total, with the vast majority being American cotton. As for construction materials, they are practically zero.

　　渝工业家银行家谈话
    反对国民党扩大内战
    要求长期和平建设
    【新华社重庆二十四日电】此间工业家银行家经济学者，顷对新华日报记者谈话，一致反对国民党扩大内战，要求长期和平建设。中国中山工厂联合会负责人之一徐崇林氏称：目前工业生产量，在内战与官僚买办资本两面夹攻下，已比战时减少百分之八十的事实，说明今天急须长期和平，而绝不是十五天的和平。民生公司负责人称：该公司在三月份百分之八十九的船只派做差运，如果内战再打半个月或一个月，民生公司只有垮台。中国工业公司及工矿建设公司总经理鲁自诚氏说：没有和平，中国工业在国际上，不能与帝国主义资本竞争，在国内不能与特殊资本（按指官僚买办资本）搏斗，工矿事业是没有前途的。迁川工厂联合会总干事胡越之氏说：“实在再打不得了，如再打去，整个社会经济都要崩溃了”。华康银行协理鄢公复氏说：内战使政府财政收支不平衡，百分之九十靠发钞票。五亿元美金的基金已快用光，财政金融前途不堪设想。中国劳协负责人朱学范，瑞华企业公司玻璃厂经理冯子源，江汉面粉厂厂长张熙光，永利银行卢澜康均一致对记者表示：只有永远消弭内战，中国经济才能复苏。
    【新华社南京二十四日电】沪讯：根据最近上海海关公布数字计算，四月份洋货进口二十倍于出口数字（三月份为十倍）进口货计八百余万万元，倍于三月份之数，出口则不到四十一万万元，较三月份反而减少四万万元。四月一个月入超之数，折合美金三千八百七十万元，但民国二十五年每月份之入超不过美金五百七十五万元，四月份入超已七倍于抗战的前一年的数字。入口绝大部分为消费品，甚至为我国所有的原料品，棉花的入口。竟占全数百分之六十，其绝大部分是美棉。关于建设器材，则简直等于零。
