[This newspaper's Weixian dispatch] In response to the continued invasion by bandits and puppets in areas like Gaotang, Yucheng, and Qihe, the spokesperson of the Jinnan Military Region has issued the following statement once again: The remnants of bandits and puppets in Gaotang, Yucheng, and Qihe areas, including Pang Changshen, Wu Chunyang, Deng Xiec臣, Yuan Yanqiu, Yun Maocai, Yang Jingzhai, Cheng Jingpu, Chen Shengtang, Li Lianxiang, and others, under the instigation and support of the Kuomintang reactionaries, began their collusion to invade our liberated areas on the fifth day after the ceasefire agreement (January 18th). They successively occupied nearly a hundred villages and towns in our Gaotang Third District, such as Liguanzhuang, Yiyangzhuang, Zhuangzhuang, Wulipu in the Fourth District, Zhushuanghuaizhuang, Tangwa, Yuanzhuang, Daizhuang in the Seventh District, Qian Zhaolou in the Sixth District, and Zhuzhuang in the Second District. They launched over two hundred attacks, deploying a total force of over thirty thousand men. More than three hundred of our cadres, militia, and civilians were injured (not including those before the ceasefire). The looted and burned property is beyond calculation. Still not satisfied, the Kuomintang 12th Army stationed in Jinan increased to thirteen companies in Qihe on May 2nd, and another regiment on the 4th, directly assisting the bandits and puppets, disrupting peace, and slaughtering the people. Under this extremely tense situation, our local soldiers and civilians, in order to respect the agreement and realize peace and democracy, continued to appeal, hoping that the ceasefire order would exert its binding force so as to resolve the issue politically and spare the people from the scourge of war. For more than a month, the situation has not only not improved but has worsened. More and more spies have appeared. Xiong Jiming, the Shandong Fourth Administrative Commissioner who was driven away by the people for colluding with the enemy and harming the people, also personally led four battalions of the Kuomintang 12th Army to openly return, along with three members of the Kuomintang Provincial Government, Xue Yingchuan, the former puppet county chief of Boping, Ge Donghua, the puppet county chief of Renping, and Luo Zhaolong and Wang Mingde's units of the former puppet troops from Bo and Qing counties, totaling more than four hundred men, arrived in the Seventh District of Gao, successively inspected the bandits and puppets, replenished ammunition, and cooperated in robbing wheat, causing disturbances everywhere. For the past half month, the bandits and puppets have been unprecedentedly active. On the 15th, Xiong's troops, in coordination with Li, Deng, Pang, and others, attacked the Manziying area, capturing more than forty of our militiamen and rifles. On the 17th, they attacked our East and West Lutou and Zhifangtou, seizing the defense area of our Deping Brigade. On the 18th, they attacked westward, advancing to the Da and Xiao Liuzhuang area of Boping. On the 19th, they attacked Zhima and Liuzhuang again, causing eight casualties to our defense forces. More than forty spies were dispatched to Ren, Bo, and Qing areas to carry out sabotage activities. The Kuomintang reactionaries attempted to combine with the puppet bandits to subvert our democratic governments in Gao, Ren, Bo, and Qing, continuing the bloody rule over the people during the enemy-puppet period. Their conspiracy is extremely obvious. Therefore, we will reiterate: (1) The soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas long for peace like a severe drought yearns for rain, and have therefore repeatedly exercised restraint. If the reactionaries insist on pressing forward, we will inevitably resolutely rise up in self-defense. (2) We demand that the Executive Headquarters swiftly stop the advance of the Kuomintang troops and order the Eighth Route Army to disarm the bandits and puppets in the Gaotang, Yucheng, and Qihe areas to eliminate the great scourge of the people. (3) The soldiers and civilians of the entire region must immediately be vigilant, prepare sufficient strength, and give the invaders the punishment they deserve.
