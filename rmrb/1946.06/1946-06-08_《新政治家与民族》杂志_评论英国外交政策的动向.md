Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: London dispatch: The liberal-leaning magazine, "New Statesman and Nation," commenting on recent trends in British foreign policy, said: Britain has a tendency to break away from the gradually developing diplomatic disputes between the United States and the Soviet Union.

    The publication stated: British and foreign officials often share the same view as this weekly. According to sources within the British Foreign Office, Bevin will respond to some of Molotov's criticisms, but will leave the role of the main anti-Soviet protagonist to Byrnes. The publication believes that the current British policy arises from a "lack of confidence" in the United States, which is manifested both in the US passage of the loan to Britain and in American political claims. The publication stated: No one can accurately explain American policy or predict America's trend towards international cooperation. The publication commented on the British railway strike, stating: The reactionary regulations proposed by the weak administrative authorities indicate that the United States' domestic and foreign policies are far from stable. It also stated that under these circumstances, it is inappropriate to advise Britain to constantly rely on the United States for action.

    评论英国外交政策的动向
    【新华社延安四日电】伦敦讯：自由主义色彩的《新政治家与民族》杂志，评论英国最近外交政策的动向说：英国有摆脱美苏之间逐渐发展的外交纠纷的趋向。
    该刊称：英国及外国官员，时与该周刊抱有同样看法。据英外部方面息，贝文虽将出而答复莫洛托夫的若干批评，但将把反苏舞台的主角，让给贝纳斯。该刊认为英国当前政策的产生原因，乃对于美国“没有把握”在美国通过对英贷款票及美国政治主张两方面，均有其表现。该刊称：谁也不能确切地说明美国的政策，并预测美国对国际合作的趋向。该刊评英国铁路罢工称：软弱的行政当局所提出的反动法规，表示美国的国内外政策尚远未平稳。并称在此情况下，劝告英国经常依靠美国而行动，是不妥当的。
