【Reported from Changzhi by this newspaper】 The rent reduction movement in Wuxiang is currently entering an in-depth stage. According to the initial summary from the Second District of the county, the movement has achieved considerable success. Statistics from just seven villages show that farmers have legally recovered 531 mu of land, 616 shi of grain, and 243,000 yuan in silver. The enthusiasm of the masses for production is significantly higher than before. However, some deviations have also occurred in this movement. When resolving mutual problems among farmers, some farmers advocated "struggle against everything." In a few villages, the issues of wealthy middle peasants and middle peasants were treated the same as those of local despots and illegal landlords. This caused anxiety among many well-to-do households, and their production enthusiasm declined. Some poor farmers also exhibited a reluctance to engage in production. After the district leadership put forward the slogans "All Farmers are One Family" and "Rent Reduction is Lifting the Stone Slab, Complete Liberation Depends on Labor," the farmers held discussions and clarified the principles that "struggling against landlords is not because they are rich, but because of their illegal exploitation and oppression," "the rental relationship between farmers is not the root cause of farmers' poverty and should be mutually compromised," and "rent reduction is just liberation, only production can lead to wealth." These deviations have been corrected. The district is now inspecting the distribution of the fruits of the struggle and conducting ideological education on organized production, in order to ensure the thorough implementation of rent reduction and the smooth development of the large-scale production movement.

    【本报长治讯】武乡的查减运动，目前已进入深入阶段。据该县二区初步总结，运动已获得相当成绩。仅七个村统计：农民依法退回的土地有五百三十一亩，粮食六百一十六石，大洋二十四万三千元，群众生产劲头较前大为高涨。但在这一运动中，也曾产生了一些偏向，就是在解决农民间相互问题时，部分农民主张“一切皆斗”，少数村庄在处理富裕中农与中农问题上，也和对待恶霸和非法地主一样，因此曾引起不少殷实户的不安，生产情绪消沉。有些贫苦农民，也产生过不事生产现象，自区的领导上提出“天下农民是一家”，“减租是揭石板，彻底翻身靠劳动”等口号之后，农民进行了讨论，弄清了“斗地主不是因为他有钱，而是因为他违法的剥削压榨”，“农民与农民的租息关系，不是农民的穷根，应该互相让步”，“减租只是翻身，生产才能发家”等道理，偏向得到纠正。该区现正检查斗争果实分配，进行组织起来生产的思想教育，以求减租的贯彻，顺利开展大生产运动。
