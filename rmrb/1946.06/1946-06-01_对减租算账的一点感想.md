    Some Thoughts on Rent Reduction Accounting
    Yin Xinglü

    Editor's Note: The author of this article, Mr. Yin Xinglü, is a well-known local notable in Huaicheng. He was arrested three times under the rule of the enemy and puppets, enduring severe torture, but always remained staunchly unyielding. After the liberation of Huai'an, regardless of his old age and illness, he actively assisted in anti-traitor work, repairing canals, organizing production, and disaster relief. He is a landlord, but he is full of a sense of justice and understands the suffering of the people. He not only voluntarily reduced rent but also persuaded his friends to implement rent reduction.

    This time, the accounting of rent between farmers and landlords in the liberated areas, especially in Huai'an, this ancient feudal city, is truly the first time in history. The public sentiment has already been reported in the newspapers, so there is no need to repeat it. In general, the landlords, large and small, always say it is "excessive," "beyond the scope," and "too left-leaning." However, speaking should be based on conscience. To criticize a matter, one cannot rely entirely on subjectivity; one must use an objective attitude. I am also a small landlord, and now I am willing to frankly offer some explanation and advice to the landlords.

    I believe the reasons for attacking the peasants come down to two factors: first, selfishness and self-interest; second, short-sightedness. The former stems from a lack of morality, the latter from a lack of understanding. First of all, we should recognize the value of the peasants. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, most of the anti-Japanese troops were organized by peasants. Without the peasants, there could be no war of resistance. In addition to some peasants directly participating in the war of resistance, most peasants engaged in production work, supporting the war of resistance. Especially the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, fighting behind enemy lines, were able to destroy the enemy and puppets and liberate cities without any external assistance. Without the peasants, victory could not have been achieved. In other words, it would not have been possible for us to gain freedom.

    Conversely, among the traitors who undermined the War of Resistance, there were very, very few peasants. On the other hand, those in the cities who had money and power wavered the most severely. Often, some people shouted "Down with Japanese imperialism!" before the arrival of the enemy, but once they fell into the hands of the enemy, under the inducement of profit and the threat of force, they lost their national integrity. There are many such people, and they should be ashamed to death compared to the pure peasants!

    For thousands of years, according to traditional customs, the peasants toiled diligently year after year, plowing in spring, sowing in summer, harvesting in autumn, and storing in winter. As a result, most of the harvest went to the landlords, and what was left was often not enough to live on. In some places, the tenant farmers were almost like serfs in Tsarist Russia, having to serve the landlords. If the landlord had special political power, or was a local tyrant and bully, his authority would be even greater, and he could set up private courts for the tenant farmers, arbitrarily use instruments of torture, and even torture them to death.

    In Huai'an, the landlords had a tool to oppress the tenant farmers called "handling rent collection." "Handling rent collection" was a tool used by the government in the past to assist landlords in oppressing tenant farmers. If a tenant farmer paid less or did not pay rent, the landlord could immediately go to the government and request "handling rent collection." The government would issue an order, and the tenant farmer would be imprisoned that evening.

    In addition, the stewards, the "masters," employed by the landlords, abused their power and committed all kinds of evil. They used larger measures when collecting rent and smaller measures when distributing it, enriching themselves at every level. For example, there were "rice field inspection fees," "solicitation fees," "ash and soil fees," and "meal provision fees," with a multitude of items, all of which had to be paid by the tenant farmers. The stewards, the clerks in the county office, and the grain collectors were all birds of a feather, speaking with one voice, helping the landlords to exploit the peasants.

    I ask, after so many years of accumulated grievances, what should it be like when they erupt after liberation? And now it is only rent reduction accounting, which is vastly different from the previous attitude of the landlords towards the tenant farmers. Landlords, please broaden your minds! Think about it calmly, and don't only think of yourselves but also of others. It is best to automatically settle accounts with the tenant farmers. After all, "good accounting doesn't mean a loss." This concerns the happiness of the masses and is the trend of the world, which cannot be reversed by a few stubborn elements. Landlords, please open up your minds!

    对减租算账的一点感想
    尹星侣
    编者按：本文作者尹星侣先生，是淮城有名士绅，在敌伪统治时他曾三次被捕，饱受酷刑，始终坚贞不屈。淮安解放后，不顾老病之躯，积极协助反奸、修水渠、组织生产、救灾等工作。他是地主，但他却富于正义感，了解人民痛苦，不但自愿减租，且劝导他的朋友实行减租。
    这次解放区农民与地主算租账，尤其在淮安这个古老封建的城市，真是有史以来第一次，群情已批诸报端，毋须复述。一般大小地主们的心里，总是说“过火”，“出范围”，“太左”，然而说话要凭良心，批评一桩事情，不可全凭主观，要用客观的态度，本人也是个小地主，现在我愿意坦白地对地主们作一番解释与忠告。
    我认为攻击农民的缘故不出两个因素：第一是由于自私自利，第二是由于眼光近视，前一个由于道德的不足，后一个属于认识的缺乏。首先我们应该认识农民的价值，八年抗战中，全部抗日军队多半是农民组织起来的，假使没有农民，就不能抗战，除了一部分农民直接参加抗战外，大部分农民从事生产工作，支持了抗战，尤其在敌后抗战的八路军、新四军，毫无外援而能摧毁敌伪，解放城池，假使没有农民是不能取得胜利的，换句话说，我们也不可能获得自由的。
    反过来看，破坏抗战的汉奸中，农民是很少很少的，倒是城市中有钱有势的人动摇得最厉害，往往有些人在敌寇未来以前，嘴里喊“打倒日本帝国主义”，等落到敌人手中，在利诱威胁之下，就丧失了民族气节，这种人比比皆是，比起纯洁的农民真应当惭愧死了呢！
    几千年来传统的习惯，农民胼手胼足，终岁勤劳，春耕夏种，秋收冬藏，结果是大部分归于地主，剩余下的往往不够生活。有些地方的佃农差不多同帝俄时代的农奴一样，要替地主们服役，假使地主在政治上有特殊势力，或者是个土豪劣绅，权威更要大一层，可以对佃农私设公堂，擅用刑具，甚至有用刑而致死的。
    在淮安地主对佃农有个压榨的利器叫做“办督收”，“办督收”是过去政府协助地主压迫佃农的工具，假使佃农少交或不交租，马上地主可以到政府请求“办督收”，政府朝颁命令，佃农夕入囹圄。
    还有地主所用的管事的“太爷”们，狐假虎威，无恶不作，大斗小斗层层中饱，例如“看稻费”，“心揽费”、“灰土费”、“供饭费”，名目繁多，都要出在佃农身上，管事的和县署的册书以及粮差都是一邱之貉，一鼻孔出气，帮助地主剥削农民的。
    试问多少年代积怨，一朝得到解放爆发起来，应当是怎样了，而现在仅仅是减租算账，比起从前地主们对佃农的态度真是有天壤之别了，地主们心量放大点吧！平心静气地想一想，不要只知有己不知有人，最好自动地和佃农算一算账、横竖“好账算不蚀”的，这是大众幸福所系，世界潮流所趋，不是少数的顽固分子可能挽回的，地主们思想开通点吧！（新华社淮阴通讯）
