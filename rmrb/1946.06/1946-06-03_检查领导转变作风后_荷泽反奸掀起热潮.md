    Following Inspection of Leadership and Change in Style:
    Anti-Traitor Campaign Sweeps Heze
    [Report from this newspaper in Heze] In the past half month, an anti-traitor liquidation campaign has swept through the city, with 10,000 people participating, opening up a new situation. On May 11, over a thousand people from the Western District, joined by bathhouse workers and rural laborers, struggled against the major traitors Zhao Yintang and Chen Cheng. On the same day, people in the Southern District struggled against the major traitor Cao Qinglun. On the 12th, over two thousand people in the Eastern District held a large meeting to clear out the assets of traitors, and also cleared out the traitorous shares and dividends from five cigarette factories, totaling about 1.8 million yuan. That afternoon, over a thousand people struggled against the major traitor Liu Yongqing. On the morning of the 15th, over 1,500 people cleared out the assets of traitors, and from just two cigarette factories, they cleared out more than 800,000 yuan. On the same day, workers in the Southern District, joined by over a thousand people, struggled against the major traitor Yang Xiushan and confiscated his property. In half a month, the masses lawfully obtained the fruits of their struggle, amounting to about 8 million yuan. The traitorous secret agents and reactionary forces have been suppressed by the masses, and social order has become more stable. The reason for these achievements is that at the city-wide cadre meeting in early May, a deep review was conducted of the unclear leadership policies of the past, which pitted the development of industry and commerce against the mass anti-traitor movement, the anti-traitor policy was not thoroughly implemented, the enthusiasm of the broad masses was suppressed, and the leadership style was not bold enough. After the review, the anti-traitor and grievance-telling policy was determined, and as a result, the movement rapidly developed.

    检查领导转变作风后
    荷泽反奸掀起热潮
    【本报荷泽讯】最近半月内，本市掀起了反奸清算运动，参加群众达一万人，打开了一个新的局面。五月十一日，西区群众千余人，联合澡塘工人，农村苦工，斗争大汉奸赵荫堂、陈诚。同日，南区群众斗争大汉奸曹庆伦。十二日东区群众两千余人开大会，清理汉奸资财，又清算出烟厂中的汉奸股金和红利五家共约一百八十万元，当日下午，群众千余人斗争大汉奸刘永庆。十五日上午，一千五百余群众清理汉奸资财，仅两家烟厂，又清算出八十多万元，同日南区工人联合群众千余人斗争大汉奸杨秀山，没收其财产。半月来群众依法获得斗争果实约有八百万元。汉奸特务反动势力受到群众的镇压，社会秩序更趋安定。这些成绩获得的原因，是由于五月初全市干部会上，深刻检讨了过去领导上的方针不明确，把发展工商业与群众反奸等运动对立，除奸政策执行不彻底，抑制了广大群众热情，领导作风是不够大胆放手等。在检讨后，确定了反奸诉苦方针，因之运动迅速开展起来。
