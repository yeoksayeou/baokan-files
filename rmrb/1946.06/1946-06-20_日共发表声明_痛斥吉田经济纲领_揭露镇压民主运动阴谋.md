Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 15th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) yesterday issued a statement denouncing the economic program recently promulgated by the new Yoshida Shigeru cabinet. The JCP statement pointed out: "Yoshida's program has failed to provide even the most basic and necessary solutions to the urgent livelihood problems of the people." The statement also exposed that Yoshida's real intention in using overcoming the economic crisis as a pretext was to conspire to suppress the democratic movement. The JCP stated: "This is Yoshida's new cabinet attempting to protect the interests of bureaucratic capital, financial cliques, and landlords." At the same time, Iwawami, chairman of the preparatory committee of the National Industrial Union Congress, also issued a statement condemning Yoshida's program, saying: "Treating labor management of production as an illegal measure is an attempt to undermine the trade union movement." Iwawami solemnly declared: "Workers will continue to adopt constructive methods, namely taking over factories, in order to eliminate the economic crisis caused by the sabotage of financial cliques." According to Yoshida's policy program for overcoming the economic crisis, the core contents are: (1) Suppressing workers' takeover of financial cliques' factories and prohibiting workers' strikes; (2) Forcing farmers to continue to provide food; (3) Requesting MacArthur's full cooperation to achieve the above objectives and appealing to the United States to import food. The Liberal Party and the Progressive Party issued statements of "unconditional approval" for Yoshida's reactionary measures. According to a Central News Agency dispatch: "Yoshida's program of levying grain from farmers and trampling on workers will arouse serious repercussions from both workers and farmers."
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 15th: Tokyo dispatch: At a meeting of the Allied Council for Japan on the 12th, Soviet representative General Derevyanko protested MacArthur's proposal to hand over the Japanese merchant fleet to Japanese private companies. Derevyanko stated: The issue of handling the Japanese merchant fleet should be discussed among the governments of all Allied countries. The British and Dominion representatives, Ruhr, agreed with the Soviet protest.

    痛斥吉田经济纲领
    揭露镇压民主运动阴谋
    【新华社延安十五日电】东京讯：日共于昨日发表声明，痛斥吉田茂新阁近日颁布的经济纲领。日共声明中指出：“吉田的纲领对人民急迫的生活问题，未作起码的必要的解决”。该声明并揭露吉田假借克服经济危机的名义，阴谋镇压民主运动的企图，是这一纲领的真实目的。日共在声明中说道：“这是吉田新阁企图保护官僚财阀与地主的利益”。与此同时，全国工业组合大会筹委会主席岩波，亦发表谈话，谴责吉田的纲领，他说：“把劳工管理生产，视为非法的措施，是企图破坏职工会运动”。岩波并郑重声称：“工人们将继续采取建设的方法，即接管工厂，以便消除由于财阀的怠工所引起的经济危机”。按吉田颁发的克服经济危机的施政纲领，其中心内容为：（１）取缔工人接管财阀工厂，禁止工人罢工；（２）强制农民继续供出食粮；（３）要求麦克阿瑟的充分合作，以达到上述目的，并吁请美国输入粮食。对吉田这种反动举措，自由党与进步党发表“无条件赞成”的声明。据中央社电称：“吉田这个向农民征粮，对工人践踏的纲领，将引起工人与农民双方严重的反响。”
    【新华社延安十五日电】东京讯：对日委员会十二日开会时，苏联代表德勒维扬科将军，抗议麦克阿瑟提出将日本商船队交给日本私人公司决议案。德勒维扬科称：处理日本商船队的问题，应在各盟国政府中间讨论。英国及其自治领代表鲁尔同意苏联此项抗议。
