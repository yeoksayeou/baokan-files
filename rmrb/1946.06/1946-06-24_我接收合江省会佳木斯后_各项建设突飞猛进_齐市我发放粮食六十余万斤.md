　　Xinhua News Agency, Jiamusi, 13th (Delayed Dispatch). Jiamusi, the capital of the United Jiang Province, a city in northern Manchuria, has witnessed rapid progress in various constructions under the active leadership of the local democratic government since the Democratic Allied Forces took over last November. Major local factories such as timber mills, oil presses, distilleries, and flour mills have all fully resumed operation. Among the timber mills, the larger ones include Yudong No. 2 Factory and the Northeast Timber Logging Company. The Yuyi Oil Mill, a joint public-private venture, produces 2.5 tons of soybean oil and 1,200 pieces of soybean cake daily. The Sanjiang Rice Mill and the Fuli Rice Mill each produce about 4 tons of rice per day; the publicly-owned Limin Rice Mill can produce 10 tons of rice daily. The Huomo Company includes the joint public-private venture Zhong Sheng Company and the privately-owned Jixiangdong, both using locally produced wheat to make flour to meet the needs of the local people. In addition, all 29 iron factories in the city have fully resumed operation, and commerce is flourishing. In addition to the North and South Markets, a fish market and a slaughterhouse have recently been added. To help the elderly, the weak, and orphans, the government has established a relief home and an orphanage. In the city, besides two public hospitals, there are 13 private hospitals. Schools include the North Manchuria Cadre School, kindergartens, and 11 primary schools, with a significant increase in enrollment compared to the Manchukuo period. The Joint Middle School is divided into four departments: normal school, senior high school, junior high school, and girls' school, with about 2,000 students. The president of the school is concurrently held by Li Yanlu, the chairman of the United Jiang Province. There is one cinema and three theaters. The eight-page, four-section *People's Daily* is warmly loved by the local people. More than 600 peasant households in the suburbs have been allocated more than 1,000 *qing* of enemy and puppet land, and more than 800 households have generally reduced their rents. After the victory in the struggle, workers in timber mills and printing factories began to participate in the management of the factories. Workers in the Manlin Carriage and Electric Industry obtained more than one million yuan in fruits during the liquidation struggle. More than 3,000 workers have voluntarily joined the trade union after the liberation struggle.
    Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 12th. Various municipal constructions in Qiqihar are actively underway. To solve the grain shortage in the city, the municipal government has mobilized counties to send grain to Qiqihar for sale. Nehe, Gannan, and Longjiang counties have transported a total of 1.15 million *jin*. More than 600,000 *jin* of grain were distributed to more than 40,000 railway employees in the city, resulting in a sharp drop in grain prices. Regarding the water supply problem, the water pipes were partially damaged due to ice formation last winter. The municipal government is now rushing to repair the water supply equipment, which will be restored soon, and is preparing to install a large number of indoor water supply facilities. At the same time, it is undertaking the registration of enemy and puppet houses, preparing to distribute them to poor citizens and families of anti-Japanese cadres who have no housing. Sixteen types of miscellaneous taxes have been abolished, and other taxable items have also been reduced by one-third of the original tax rate. All schools have resumed classes. Streetlights have been installed on all streets, and the traffic park will be opened soon. To solve the problem of livestock for spring plowing in various counties, livestock trading officially began on the 5th.
