Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 9th: According to Reuters, Lord Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander of Southeast Asia, recently revealed to reporters in London that if foreign troops were to advance on the East Indies, the situation would not be optimistic. When he spoke of the strength of the East Indies patriotic army, he said, "They have one airplane, some artillery, and rifles and mortars are quite sufficient. The regular army numbers 150,000, is well-organized, and if Dutch troops encounter isolated pocket formations of the East Indies army, they will be able to deal with them, as they have superior firepower, but if the East Indies people resist on a national scale, then things will be different."

    蒙特巴顿称
    东印军力量强大进犯者未可乐观
    【新华社延安九日电】据路透社讯：东南亚盟军最高统帅蒙特巴顿，近在伦敦向记者透露：外国军队倘若向东印进军，情势未可乐观。他谈到东印爱国军的实力时称：“他们有飞机一架，若干炮兵，而来复枪及迫击炮则甚充足。正规军有十五万，组织良好，倘若荷军遇到东印军的孤立的袋形阵地，他们是能够对付的，因他们有较优良的火力，但如果东印人在全国范围进行抵抗，则事情就异样了”。
