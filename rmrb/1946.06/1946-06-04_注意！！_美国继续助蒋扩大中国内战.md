Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st - Reliable sources: While Mr. Marshall seems to be striving to call for peace in the Northeast and China, three divisions of the Kuomintang's 53rd Army, currently stationed in Vietnam, will soon be transported to the Northeast by American ships to expand the already greatly expanded civil war. In addition, there is talk that the 5th Army will also be transported to the Northeast by American ships. It is reported that Mr. Marshall has the power to use American ships to transport Kuomintang troops. Previously, it was agreed to only transport five Kuomintang armies to the Northeast, but this agreement was violated and two more armies were transported. In April, it was promised that after transporting the 93rd Army, American ships would no longer transport troops for the Kuomintang. However, after Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Chinese civil war, refused peace in the Northeast and nationwide peace, as if obeying instructions, the United States continued to use its own naval transport and a large amount of military equipment and munitions to actively help the Kuomintang expand the civil war. As a result, the Chinese civil war has expanded as never before. This situation of close cooperation between the US and Chiang in massacring the Chinese people deserves serious attention.

    注意！！
    美国继续助蒋扩大中国内战
    【新华社延安一日电】确息：当马歇尔氏好象在努力呼吁东北与中国和平的时候，现住越南的国民党五十三军三个师，又将于日内由美舰运往东北，扩大现已十分扩大的内战。此外第五军亦有将由美舰运往东北之说。按马歇尔氏对于使用美舰运输国民党军握有权力，以前曾约定只为国民党运五个军去东北，后乃违约增运两个军，四月间又曾约许美舰在运过第九十三军以后，不再为国民党运兵，但在中国内战首领蒋介石好象遵守指令一样的拒绝东北和平与全国和平以后，美国方面就又继续使用自己的海军运输工具及大量军械军火，积极帮助国民党扩大内战，而其结果，确使中国的内战空前地扩大了。此种美蒋双方密切合作屠杀中国人民的形势，深堪注意。
