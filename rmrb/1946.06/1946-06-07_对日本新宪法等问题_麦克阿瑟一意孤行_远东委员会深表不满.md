Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: According to United Press and other Washington reports: Representatives of various countries on the Far Eastern Commission (except the United States) are greatly dissatisfied with MacArthur's refusal to send liaison officers to consult with the Far Eastern Commission on Japan's new constitution and his failure to consult with the Allied Council for Japan before explaining food import demands to Japan. Some members of the Far Eastern Commission told United Press reporters on the 1st that they would fight MacArthur to the finish on the issue of responsibility for Japan's new constitution. It is said that Japan's new constitution was drafted by Brigadier General Whitney, an American representative of the Government Section of the Allied Headquarters, and some clauses were personally drafted by MacArthur. Emperor Hirohito of Japan expressed considerable satisfaction with this. The Far Eastern Commission will accuse MacArthur of failing to consult with the Far Eastern Commission or other Allied representatives on the issue of reforming the Japanese constitution. According to the Central News Agency: Representatives of the Soviet Union, Australia, and New Zealand have requested "greater revisions" to the "Japanese Constitution," and they are dissatisfied with most of the "MacArthur Constitution," which is almost identical to the American Constitution. Some members of the Far Eastern Commission are demanding clarification of their status in policymaking. They currently believe that the commission is working in a vacuum.

    对日本新宪法等问题
    麦克阿瑟一意孤行
    远东委员会深表不满
    【新华社延安四日电】据合众社等华盛顿讯：远东委员会各国代表（美国除外）因麦克阿瑟拒绝派遣联络官与远委会商讨日本新宪以及在向远委会说明输日粮食要求前不与对日委员商讨等问题，已引起极大不满。远委会数委员一日向合众社记者表示：对日本新宪法责任问题，即将与麦克阿瑟决一胜负。据称：日本新宪法出自盟军统帅部政府组美人代表费特尼少将之手，有些条文，则由麦克阿瑟亲自草成。日皇裕仁对此颇表满意。远委会将指责麦克阿瑟，认为改革日宪问题，既未与远委会磋商，又未与其他盟国代表商讨。据中央社称：苏澳和纽西兰代表，已要求对“日宪”作“更大的修改”，他们对几乎与美国宪法相似的“麦克阿瑟宪法”的大部分，咸表不满。远委会某些委员，要求弄清楚他们对于制定政策的地位。彼等目前认为委员会是放在真空管中工作。
