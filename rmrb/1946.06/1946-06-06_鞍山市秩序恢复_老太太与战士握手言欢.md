Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 3rd. After the Democratic Allied Forces completely recovered Anshan City on the 26th, citizens spontaneously helped the stationed troops clean up the battlefield. Many elderly women grabbed the soldiers' hands and said, "Our own troops are back again." Now, order in Anshan City has been rapidly restored. The democratic municipal government began working on the 27th, and the radio station is broadcasting various programs. Citizens are saying, "Real China is back, and the second Manchukuo has fallen again." It is reported that after Anshan City was occupied by the Kuomintang army on April 1st, it fell into extreme chaos. Secret agents and puppet police roamed everywhere, and bandits were rampant, plunging the citizens back into misery. Therefore, the people compared them to "Manchukuo."

    鞍山市秩序恢复
    老太太与战士握手言欢
    【新华社鞍山三日电】民主联军于二十六日全部恢复鞍山市后，市民即自动帮助驻军打扫战场。很多老太太拉着战士的手说：“自家队伍又来了”。现在鞍山市内秩序已迅速恢复，民主的市政府已于二十七日开始办公，广播电台已放送各种节目，市民们都说：“真中国又回来了，第二个满洲国又倒台了”。按鞍山市于四月一日被国民党军侵占后，即呈极端混乱状态，特务伪警到处横行，土匪猖獗，使市民重陷苦海之中。所以老百姓把他们比之为“满洲国”。
