　　Our Army Liberates Gushan Station
    Liaocheng People Demand Dissolution of Puppet Troops in the City
    [This newspaper, Handan, 20th dispatch] The Eighth Route Army of the First Military Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, in order to eliminate the frequent attacks by Chiang's puppet troops on our Changqing liberated area, stationed troops in Gushan Station (sixty li from Jinan) on the Jinpu Railway on the 10th of this month at the request of the local people. The Chiang's puppet troops entrenched in the station were completely defeated, and the order in the area has quickly stabilized.
    [This newspaper, Weixian, 20th dispatch]: The puppet troops of Wang Jinxiang, Guo Peide, and Zhao Zhenhua inside the city of Liaocheng, disregarding the ceasefire agreement of the February 26th Executive Group, and with the support of Kuomintang planes transporting weapons and ammunition daily, have continuously attacked and harassed our military and civilians outside the city, and have become even more rampant in recent days. At about 12:00 midnight on the 4th of this month, the puppet troops moved out from the four gates, attacked our garrison troops outside the city, forcibly occupied our positions, and then dispatched 400 troops in three routes to attack our Dongguan, occupying the north end of Mi Temple and the Xiaolibaishi Street at the west entrance, and also rushed to Dongguan Street, Yaowangmiao Street, and Loushiko Street to carry out large-scale burning and looting, with more than 60 houses burned, and countless furniture and property looted, and the remainder was destroyed. Our army, unable to bear it any longer, resolutely rose up to repel them. Unexpectedly, these puppets, deliberately provoking trouble, repeatedly sneaked out of the city on the nights of the 6th and 7th at about 12:00 midnight and attacked us, but were all driven back into the city. After this looting, many residents in Dongguan were unable to maintain their livelihoods and cried to the local Eighth Route Army, resolutely demanding the disarmament of the puppet troops in the city. According to sources, Wang Jinxiang, the head of the puppet troops in the city, was the national traitor who colluded with the enemy in 1938 to invade and occupy Liaocheng and murder the anti-Japanese elder Fan Zhuxian. After Guo Peide and Zhao Zhenhua defected to the enemy, they killed countless people, and the people in the Liaocheng area called them "Dongchang Slaughterhouses."

　　我军解放崮山车站
    聊城人民要求解散城内伪军
    【本报邯郸二十日电】冀鲁豫一分区八路军，为解除蒋伪军对我长清解放区之经常进攻，于本月十日，应当地人民之请，进驻津浦线上之崮山车站（离济南六十里），盘据该站之蒋伪军全被击溃，该地秩序顿趋稳定。
    【本报威县二十日电】：聊城城内伪军王金祥、郭培德、赵振华部，不遵守二月二十六日执行小组的停战协议，在国民党飞机每日运送武器弹药的支持下，不断向我城外军民进攻袭扰，近日更愈益猖狂。本月四日夜十二时许，伪军从四门出动，进攻我城外驻军，强占我阵地后，又出动四百余分三路向我东关进攻，占领米寺北头与西口小礼拜寺街，并窜至东关大街、药王庙街、驴市口街大肆焚烧洗劫，计房屋被烧六十余间，抢去家具财物无算，所剩余者悉被捣毁，我军忍无可忍乃奋起将其击退。不料该伪等蓄意挑衅，又于六七两日夜十二时许一再窜出城外，向我进攻，均被击回城内。东关居民经此洗劫后，多无法维持生活，纷纷向当地八路军哭诉，坚决要求解除城内伪军武装。按城内伪军头子王金祥即系一九三八年勾结敌寇侵陷聊城，谋害抗战老人范筑先的民族罪人，郭逆培德及赵逆振华投敌后，杀人无算，聊城一带人呼之为“东昌宰房”。
