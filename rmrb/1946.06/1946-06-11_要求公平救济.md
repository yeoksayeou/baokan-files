(I)
On April 20th of this year, the China Liberated Areas Relief Committee stationed in Yan'an issued a written statement, appealing to the people of the world to fairly distribute post-war relief supplies and provide emergency relief to refugees in the Liberated Areas. The statement pointed out with sorrow: "According to the seven major work plans of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (hereinafter referred to as 'CRRRA') in 1946, there are approximately 42 million refugees in the country, and 26 million refugees in the Liberated Areas are in urgent need of relief. If distributed fairly according to the proportion of the refugee population, the Liberated Areas should receive three-fifths of the relief supplies." But what is the actual situation? The spokesperson pointed out: "According to CRRRA's report at the Kuomintang Second Plenary Session, as of February 20th, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (hereinafter referred to as 'UNRRA') had shipped 250,000 tons of materials to China (excluding the number arriving in March and April). As of April, the Liberated Areas had received approximately 800 tons, accounting for only three-thousandths of the materials shipped to China in February. Refugees accounting for three-fifths receive three-thousandths of the relief. This is the most unfair and unreasonable thing, violating the principles stipulated in the UNRRA charter."

The spokesperson issued a statement to the people of the world and stated: "We, the entire people of the Liberated Areas, are willing to use our qualification of having shed the most blood, contributed the most, and suffered the deepest during the War of Resistance Against Japan to request UNRRA to officially recognize each Liberated Area as a complete relief unit, and three-fifths of all materials in UNRRA relief should be allocated to relieve refugees in the Liberated Areas, so that they can heal the wounds of war in a timely manner and restore the peaceful and prosperous life they deserve."

The appeal and demands of the China Liberated Areas Relief Committee undoubtedly correctly express what the people of the Liberated Areas want to say and are supported.

Although the quantity of relief supplies recently obtained by the Liberated Areas has increased slightly, compared with the increased amount of UNRRA materials shipped to China in the nearly four months since February 20th, the above-mentioned ratio of three-thousandths has not only not increased, but may even decrease?

The following reflects the facts of the unfair treatment suffered by the people of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, which is enough to prove the truth and appropriateness of the spokesperson of the China Liberated Areas Relief Committee. We hope that upright people at home and abroad will give friendly judgment and fair handling.

(II)
During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and four years of famine in our region, it was also one of the areas most severely devastated by the enemy's "Three Alls Policy." The tragic loss of life and property of the people has been publicly counted by the Border Region Government and the Border Region Relief Branch, and has been repeatedly appealed to UNRRA and CRRRA in writing, which will not be repeated here. There are now approximately 4 million refugees in urgent need of relief. What kind of people are they? First and foremost, the largest number are the victims of the enemy's "Three Alls Policy." Villages of houses have been destroyed, and the loss and destruction of food, clothing, livestock, and agricultural implements are severe. Coupled with years of natural disasters, the vitality has been greatly damaged. Today, half of them are unable to rebuild their homes and restore their normal production and need relief. Secondly, in the past eight years, people who fled to other places due to enemy disasters or were captured by the enemy and forced to work in other places have returned home one after another after the war. Most of them have empty walls and face difficulties in food and clothing; and their health is deteriorated, making it difficult to carry out production well, and they urgently need help. Furthermore, the people in the newly liberated areas suffered the most from enemy looting; poverty is the deepest, and the landscape is devastated. Before the war, most middle-class families fell into bankruptcy in eight years, let alone the poor. In addition, regardless of the new or old Liberated Areas, due to the long-term war and famine, they were blockaded by the enemy in the past and are now blockaded by the Kuomintang. The lack of medicine and the prevalence of diseases have a profound impact on production and labor.

The above only lists the major points, and there are other issues such as the wounded, disabled, orphans, and helpless dependents of the resistance, which are difficult to describe in detail. The specific situation has been witnessed by many Chinese and foreign people engaged in relief work. This spring, UNRRA representatives Andre Tinnès (Belgian) and CRRRA Taiyuan Branch representatives Zhang Chongde traveled from Taigu to Handan through the Taihang area, personally experiencing the dilapidated walls and the miserable state of the people in the newly liberated areas along the Zhan (Zhanshang) Ma (Mafang) line after they were just liberated.

(III)
The people and government of the Border Region are by no means like those who rely solely on foreign aid without making efforts themselves. We have done our best to seek self-reliance, such as the army and the people sharing weal and woe, practicing thrift, people helping each other, the government allocating food and funds, the old Liberated Areas helping the new Liberated Areas, work relief, vigorously restoring production, repairing roads and rivers, etc., all of which have facts to prove. Only in this way can order be stabilized and the hungry and cold be revived.

However, because all production organizations, sanitation, water conservancy, social welfare and other facilities were severely destroyed by the enemy, and after eight years of enemy disasters, the remedial power is ultimately limited. The foreign aid that the people of the Border Region hope for only requires its due share and has no extravagant hopes. The government and relief workers in the Border Region have made great efforts to obtain the assistance of UNRRA's relief supplies shipped to China. After conducting a preliminary investigation of the disaster situation, in addition to reporting to the China Liberated Areas Relief Committee in Yan'an for unified consultation, since March of this year, they have continuously sent party representatives to Kaifeng, Xinxiang, Beiping, Taiyuan (through our district representatives in the Executive Group), and Shandong (through the Shandong Provincial Government) to present the disaster situation and request relief. Since February of this year, UNRRA representatives Andre Tinnès, Michael Keon, Wander, H.A. Van Andel, Grant, Pannuti, Sood, Zhu Zhimin and other gentlemen and CRRRA branch representatives Zhang Chongde, Zhang Manyou, Zhang Huiquan and other gentlemen have also come to inspect successively. The government and relief organizations in this region received these guests with a high degree of friendship, enthusiasm, and careful disaster presentations. The above-mentioned gentlemen all solemnly stated that they would handle fair emergency relief regardless of boundaries, and brought back the plan for requesting relief in this region, and some even signed agreements. The people of the Border Region are grateful for the hard work and sympathy shown by the gentlemen for the disasters in this region, but after several months, the actual material distribution actions taken by UNRRA based on the inspections of the gentlemen showed serious unfairness, which cannot but make people regret!

(IV)
What have we gotten from UNRRA so far (June 1st)? It's too pitiful to say! Only the people of twelve counties in northern Henan received 12,000 bags of flour, 120 packages of clothes, 18 million yuan of seed loans in legal tender, and 12 boxes of medicine and gauze. The people of Yongnian City received 300,000 catties of grain relief, and this grain was still produced by the hard work of the people in this region. We also advanced the freight, and the materials used by UNRRA to pay for the grain price and freight have not yet been shipped. In addition, Puyang Hospital received a small amount of medicine.

As of June 1st, this is all the relief materials the people of this region have received from UNRRA. Compared with the relief materials that UNRRA has shipped to China (Mr. Grant said that it exceeded 300,000 tons in early May), what is the proportion? The number of refugees in this region (4 million) accounts for less than one-tenth of the total number of refugees in China (42 million), and the relief materials received are only this number. How seriously unfair and unreasonable is this! And the problem is not just this.

Of the 25 counties in northern Henan in this region, except for the 12 counties that received materials, the number that the remaining 13 counties should have received were all given to the Kuomintang government, and the refugees in the counties under this region did not receive any at all. I don't know what the reason is?

Furthermore, the flour obtained in northern Henan in this region is generally fourth-grade black flour, with a lot of bran. May I ask where the first, second, and third-grade flour went?

Except for the aforementioned people of Yongnian City, the refugees in Shandong and Hebei provinces under this region have not even received a general inspection from UNRRA and CRRRA so far, let alone actual relief! However, they are particularly concerned about Yongnian Han traitors and puppet troops who have been helping the enemy fight, slaughtering compatriots, and still holding weapons to challenge and disturb the people. At first, the Kuomintang wanted to use UNRRA flour to relieve them, but it failed. They changed to using airplanes to transport sesame seed cakes from the air, killing more than 20 people and destroying 70% of civilian houses. Recently, they demolished more civilian houses on a larger scale (demolishing one-third of the civilian houses in the entire city) to build an airport for transporting ammunition and relief supplies. On June 5th, a transport plane carrying sesame seed cakes and military uniforms from Beiping to Yongnian crashed into the Liberated Area because it was hit while throwing military uniforms. Five of the eight crew members were injured (and are now being treated by us). The plane was destroyed. We demand that UNRRA investigate whether the sesame seed cakes were made from relief flour? We protest against the Kuomintang's crime of supporting Han traitors and puppet troops at the expense of the lives and property of the people and preparing for a large-scale civil war! We demand the immediate disbandment of the puppet army and compensation to the people!

It must also be stated here: It is worth thanking UNRRA for relieving the people of Yongnian City, and the Border Region people and the Relief Association have spent a lot of effort to cooperate. But why is there no action yet for the vast number of refugees in this region (except for the nine counties in northern Henan)? This cannot but make the common people discuss and speculate about the purpose of relieving the people of Yongnian City.

(V)
The problem is so obvious: The distribution of UNRRA's relief supplies shipped to China is so unfair and unreasonable, violating the principles stipulated in the UNRRA charter, and also violating the Jiang (Tingfu) Zhou (Enlai) agreement established in Chongqing in January this year based on this principle.

The army and government of this region, like the implementation of other agreements, strictly implemented the Jiang-Zhou agreement. The government of this region solemnly and diligently implemented the various agreements negotiated with the representatives of UNRRA and CRRRA, constantly dispatched representatives, warmly received the representatives of UNRRA and CRRRA who came to inspect, and did everything possible to do what should be done. But the people of this region have not yet received the fair treatment they deserve! I don't know what the reason is.

We believe that it is necessary to solemnly explain the true situation and appeal to compatriots across the country and the people of the world for fair criticism.

We declare once again: The people of the Border Region are not those who only rely on foreign aid without trying to save themselves, and we strongly oppose those who say this. When our self-help power is insufficient, we only ask to get our due share from the outside and have no extravagant hopes. This is a reasonable demand and a just call, which should be sympathized and supported by upright people at home and abroad.

### 要求公平救济

    要求公平救济
    （一）
    本年四月二十日驻延安的中国解放区救济委员会发表书面谈话，向全世界人民提出声诉，呼吁公平分配善后救济物资，紧急救济解放区难民。发言中沉痛的指出：“根据行政院善后救济总署（以下简称行总）一九四六年七大工作计划所载，全国难民约有四千二百万人，而解放区急待救济的难民则占二千六百万人。若按难民人口比例公平分配，解放区应获得救济物资的五分之三”。可是实际上如何呢？发言人指出：“根据行总在国民党二中全会上的报告，联合国善后救济总署（下简称联总），运抵中国之物资，截至二月二十日为止已达二十五万吨（三四月份到达数目不在内）。而截至四月份为止，各解放区所得共约八百吨，仅占二月份运华物资千分之三。以占五分之三的难民得占千分之三的救济，这是最不公道与最不合理的事情，违反了联总章程上所规定的原则。”
    发言人向全世界人民提出声明，并提出：“我们解放区全体人民愿以在抗日战争中流血最多，贡献最大，蒙难最深的资格，要求联总正式承认各解放区为一完整之救济单位，在联总救济中之全部物质中应分配五分之三救济解放区难民，俾能及时的医治战争创伤，恢复和平时期应有的安居乐业的生活。”
    中国解放区救委会的声诉和要求，无疑的正确表达了各解放区人民所要说的话，得到拥护与支持。
    最近各解放区所得救济物资数量虽稍有增益，然与自二月二十日以来将及四个月时间的联总运华物资增加数目相较，上述千分之三的比例不仅未提高，或者还会降低？
    下面反映一下我们晋冀鲁豫边区人民所受此种不公平待遇的事实，足以证明中国解放区救济委员会发言之真实恰当，愿国内外正直人士予以友谊之衡断与公平的处理。
  （二）
    本区八年抗战，四年灾荒，又是敌人“三光政策”摧残最重的地区之一，人民生命财产损失之惨重情形，边区政府与边区救济分会曾公表统计，并曾不止一次的以书面向联总行总声诉过，这里不再重叙。现在急待救济的难民约有四百万人。都是些什么样的人呢？首先最多的是敌人“三光政策”之牺牲者，成村的房屋被毁了，粮食、被服、牲口、农具之丢失毁坏是惨重的，加以连年天灾，元气大损，今天其中有半数无力重建其家园和恢复其正常的生产，须待救济。其次八年来因敌祸天灾而流亡他乡，或因被敌俘虏强征迫往异地工作，战后已络绎回家，其中多数家徒四壁，衣食困难；而又健康败坏，难以很好进行生产，急须帮助。又次新解放区之人民受敌掠夺最重；贫困最深，满目疮痍，战前中等人家八年中率多陷于破产，贫苦者更无论矣。此外无论新老解放区因长期战争与灾荒，过去被敌封锁，今日又受国民党封锁，医药缺乏，疾疫流行，深重的影响到生产劳动力。
    以上仅列举大端，还有伤残孤寡，无告抗属等问题，难于详述。其具体情况曾为许多中外从事救济工作的人士所目睹。如今春联总代表安定远（比国人）和行总太原分署代表张崇德两先生自太谷到邯郸纵穿太行区，亲历沿途颓垣残壁及沾（沾上）马（马坊）线上新解放区人民在刚刚解放后啼饥号寒之惨状。
  （三）
    边区人民及其政府绝非如那些徒恃外援而不自行努力者。我们已经尽力之所能以谋自救，如军民同甘共苦，节衣缩食，人民互济互助，政府拨粮拨款，老解放区帮助新解放区，以工代赈，大力恢复生产，修路治河等等，均有事实可证。如此才能使秩序得以安定，饥寒者得以苏生。
    但因一切生产组织、卫生、水利、社会福利等设备为敌摧残过甚，八年敌祸天灾之余生，补救力量终属有限。边区人民所希望的外援，也只要求其应得之分，并无奢望。边区的政府与从事救济工作的人员，对于如何才能取得联总运华救济物资之帮助，作了很大的努力。在进行灾情初步调查之后，除报由延安中国解放区救济委员会统一商谈外，自今年三月起即不断的向开封、新乡、北平、太原（通过执行小组我区代表）、山东（通过山东省政府）派党代表、陈述灾情，要求救济。自今年二月起联总代表安定远、米甘、万德华、恒安石、郭兰特、潘伦迪、苏德、朱治民等诸先生及行总各分署代表张崇德、张蔓友、张汇泉等诸先生亦曾先后莅临视察。本区政府与救济组织以高度的友谊热情和仔细的灾情陈述，接待了这些来宾。上述各位先生都曾郑重的声明要不分畛域的办理公平急救，并携回本区要求救济的计划书，有的且签订了协定。各位先生的辛苦和对本区灾难的同情表示，边区人民是感谢的，但时历数月，实际上联总根据各先生的视察所采取的物资分配行动，表现了严重的不公平，则不能令人无憾！
  （四）
    截至现在（六月一号）我们从联总得到了什么东西呢？说来太可怜了！只有豫北十二县人民得到了面粉一万二千袋，衣服一百二十包，种子贷金法币一千八百万元，药品及纱布十二箱，永年城人民得到粮食救济三十万斤，而这些粮食还是本区人民血汗劳作之生产品。我们并垫借运费，联总用以偿付粮价及运费之物资，尚未运来。此外濮阳医院得到一小部药品。
    截至六月一日本区人民从联总所得到的救济物资只有此数，以与联总已运到中国的救济物资（据郭兰特先生说五月初已超过三十万吨）相比较，其比例是多少呢？本区难民数目（四百万）占全中国难民总数（四千二百万）十分之一弱，而所得救济物资仅只此数，这是如何严重的不公平与不合理！而问题还不止此。
    本区豫北二十五县，除十二个县得到物资外，其余十三县应得之数全交给了国民党的政府，本区所属各该县难民丝毫未能得到，不知这是什么道理？
    再本区豫北所得面粉概为四等的黑面，麸秕甚多，试问头二三等的面粉都那里去了？
    本区所属山东及河北省难民除前述永年城人民外，至今联总行总连大概视察都没有，实际救济更无论矣！但独对助敌作战残杀同胞至今犹持械挑战强扰人民之永年汉奸伪军，反关切备至，始则国民党要以联总面粉救济之，不成，改以飞机运输大饼从空投掷，砸死人民二十余，压毁民房已十之七，最近更大拆民房（拆除全城民房三分之一），修飞机场，以为输送弹药救济品之用，六月五日且有一架由北平运送大饼及军服来永年之运输飞机，因投掷军服被撞落解放区，驾驶人员八人中五人负伤（现被我收容医治中），飞机被撞毁坏。我们要求联总调查此项大饼是否由救济面粉所制吗？我们抗议国民党这种不恤人民生命财产支援汉奸伪军，准备大内战的罪行！要求立即解散伪军，抚恤人民！
    此地还须声明：联总救济永年城人民是值得感谢的，边区人民及政府救济会曾费大力协作。但何以对本区广大的难民（除豫北九县外）还未有动作？这不能不使老百姓对于救济永年城人民的目的有所议论与揣测。
  （五）
    问题是这样的明显：联总运华救济物资之分配是这样的不公平不合理，违反了联总章程上所规定的原则，也违反了根据这个原则于今年一月在重庆所成立的蒋（廷黻）周（恩来）协议。
    本区的军队与政府，如其执行其他协定一样，严肃的执行了蒋周协议。本区政府郑重而努力的执行了与联总行总各位代表所商订的各协议，不断的派出了代表，热情的接待了来视察的联总行总的各位代表，尽一切力量作了应作的事情。可是本区人民至今还未得到应有的公平待遇！不知这又是什么原因呢。
    我们认为有郑重说明真实情形向全国同胞全世界人民申诉求得公正批判之必要。
    再一次的声明：边区人民不是仅靠外援而不尽力自救者，恰好反对这样说的人。我们在自救力量不够的时候，也只是要求从外面得到其应得之一份，并无奢望。这是合理的要求，正义的呼声，当为中外正直人士所同情与赞助。
