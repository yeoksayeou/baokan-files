Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: New York dispatch: The "All-American Negro Congress," representing 1.3 million people, was held on the 1st in Detroit, Michigan, in the northwestern United States. It unanimously expressed its firm determination to break free from the shackles of slavery and demanded that the US government grant Negroes full freedom. The congress also sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Lie, complaining to the United Nations about the oppression suffered by 1.3 million Negroes in the United States. The letter began by stating that the "Negro Congress" proposed that the United Nations organization pay attention to the fact that, a century after the emancipation of slaves, Negroes still cannot find liberation from oppression. The letter pointed out: "The Negroes of America are suffering inhuman destruction under a system of oppression and discrimination, and the ravages of unscientific fascist racist theories. We demand full freedom and absolute equality."
