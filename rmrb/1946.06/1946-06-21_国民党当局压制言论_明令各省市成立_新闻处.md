　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: Chongqing Dispatch: Since the Kuomintang authorities issued an order to establish "Information Offices" in various provinces and cities to control speech, Chongqing, Xi'an, and other places have already followed suit. The Chongqing Municipal Government's "Information Office" even promulgated so-called "Publication and Distribution Precautions" on May 28th, completely destroying the Political Consultative Conference resolutions and Chiang Kai-shek's promises. The main points continue to implement a fascist-style publication "licensing system," stipulating that "newspapers or magazines must, before their first publication, have the publisher fill out a registration application form and request the Social Bureau to submit it to the Municipal Government for approval before they can be published. If there are any changes to the registered items after the registration application is approved, the publisher shall apply for change of registration within five days according to the registration procedure." Regarding the content and nature of publications, it is stipulated that "political leaflets and slogans must obtain the permission of the Social Bureau before being distributed or posted," and the so-called "publications must not contain speech or propaganda that violates the Three Principles of the People and subverts the National Government, or damages the interests of the Republic of China, or disrupts public order and tranquility, and must not contain records that harm good customs," which can be used to incriminate people at any time. Fines are also stipulated, such as: "If the publisher of a publication fails to apply for publication and publishes it without authorization, or fails to apply for a change of registration for matters that should be changed, the Municipal Government, after consulting the Ministry of the Interior for approval, shall suspend the publication."

　　国民党当局压制言论
    明令各省市成立“新闻处”
    【新华社延安十七日电】渝讯：自国民党当局明令各省市成立管制言论的“新闻处”后，重庆、西安等地业已照办。而重庆市府“新闻处”更于五月二十八日颁布所谓“出版发行注意事项”，彻底摧毁了政协决议与蒋介石诺言。其要点继续施行法西斯式的出版“特许制”，规定：“新闻纸或杂志于首次发行前，应由发行人填报登记申请书，请由社会局转呈市府核准后，始得发行。申请登记核准后，应行登记事项有变更时，应由发行人于五日内依照登记程序，申请变更登记”。而对于出版物之内容性质，则规定：“政治性之传单标语，于发行张贴前，应得社会局之许可”，以及随时可以罗致人罪的所谓“出版品不得记载违反三民主义与颠覆国民政府，或损害中华民国利益，及破坏公共安宁秩序之言论与宣传，并不得为防害善良风俗之记载”，并规定罚款如：“出版品发行人不申请发行，径自发行，或对应为变更登记之事项而不声请变更登记者，经市府咨请内政部核准后，停止该出版品之发行”。
