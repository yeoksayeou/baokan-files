    Cultural and Educational Briefs
    *New Literature* Launched in the Taiyue Area
    [Our Newspaper] The inaugural issue of *New Literature*, a purely literary publication in the Taiyue area, was published on June 1st. Although the preparation for the journal was short, the content is considered lively and substantial. The inaugural issue includes an article by Sun Dingguo, Deputy Commander of the Taiyue Military Region, titled "Opinions on Three Issues in Writing," which provides a comprehensive narrative of the New Literature movement in the Taiyue area in the past. In particular, it puts forward many concrete suggestions on how to strive towards the literary direction indicated by Chairman Mao in the future. Other items include short stories and reports such as "Uprooting Poverty," focusing on the vigorous mass movement underway in the Taiyue area, and "In War," focusing on the struggle against the enemy during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. The journal is a 32-page letterpress publication, with approximately 30,000 words per issue. The publication of this journal is a concrete realization in the Taiyue area of the decision to launch the New Literature movement made at the April Border Region Literary and Art Symposium.
    Fourth Solicited Adaptation of "Three Hundred Years Since the Jia Shen Incident" Completed
    [Our Newspaper, Changzhi] The Taihang Federation of Literary and Art Circles previously solicited adaptations of "Three Hundred Years Since the Jia Shen Incident" into plays, and now the fourth solicited adaptation has been completed. Jiao Yimin, Han Tingzuo, Tian Weiming, and Zhuang Yaoming of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military and Political University collectively adapted it, tentatively titled "Eighteen Days of the Dynasty." It is in the form of Peking Opera, with more than thirty scenes and many interspersed mass scenes. It depicts the entire process of Li Zicheng from success to failure in a detailed and vivid way. It has already been successfully test-performed. The university has organized a research group to revise it based on audience feedback during the test performance. Once finalized, it will be sent to the Taihang Federation of Literary and Art Circles for consideration. Furthermore, the Propaganda Team of the Taihang Military Region is currently rehearsing the four-act play "Comrade, You Have Taken the Wrong Path," scheduled to premiere on the "July 1st" anniversary.
        Border Region Government Cadres Actively Write for this Newspaper
    [Our Newspaper] In response to Chairman Yang's call for everyone to contribute more articles to the newspaper, many comrades in the Border Region Government and its directly affiliated systems have actively responded. Approximately thirty people have volunteered to write for the newspaper. Secretary-General Sun also encouraged everyone, stating that whoever writes the most articles will receive a merit. Everyone's enthusiasm is even higher. Currently, the Department of Civil Affairs has already written six articles for the newspaper. Comrades participating in the emancipation teams have pledged to write more articles after going to the countryside and to compete with each other, so that the newspaper can truly become a weapon for "everyone to read and run the newspaper, exchange experiences, and promote work."
