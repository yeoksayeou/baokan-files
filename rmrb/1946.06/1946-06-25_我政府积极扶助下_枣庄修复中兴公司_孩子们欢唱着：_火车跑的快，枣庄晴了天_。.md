　　【Xinhua News Agency, Teng County, 20th】The Democratic Government's Mining Bureau is helping the Zaozhuang Zhongxing Company to organize machinery and resume work. The bureau has lent flour to the capitalist representative, Keli Ke, to subsidize the workers; now the workers in the boiler group workshop of the telecommunications department who have resumed work can get one kilogram of flour per person per day, and the workers' morale is extremely high. The Xigou River power line has been completely connected and the lights will be turned on within days. The Beida Well coking pool and three locomotives destroyed by traitor Wang Jimei have been repaired, and the train is busy transporting garbage out of the company. The Ju Ren Hospital of the Mining Bureau has gone to the company for free medical treatment, and no less than 200 people come to see the doctor every day. For the convenience of the workers' shopping, the municipal government has also set up a market in the company. The workers said with emotion: "If the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army had come a month earlier, we would not only have lived and worked in peace and contentment earlier, but also fewer than a hundred workers would have died." Therefore, more than a hundred workers in Xin town in the city voluntarily beat gongs and drums and carried goods to show their appreciation to the army on the 16th. The children cheerfully sang: "The train runs fast, the sky is clear over Zaozhuang, the train whistles loudly, the traitor Wang Jimei sees the King of Hell."
