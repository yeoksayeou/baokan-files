    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: New York dispatch: Nearly 200,000 American sailors and dockworkers went on strike yesterday, paralyzing shipping in various ports. Although union leaders reached an agreement with shipowners in Washington, local union leaders, because the agreement has not yet been approved by workers in various regions, still held the strike on the scheduled date. Yesterday, unions across the country were meeting to approve the agreement.

    【新华社延安十六日电】纽约讯：美国近二十万海员与码头工人昨日举行罢工，使各港航运遭受麻痹。工会领袖虽在华盛顿与船主获致协议，但各地方工会领袖，因协议尚未经各地工人批准，故仍在预定日期举行罢工。昨日全国各地工会均在开会，以批准协议。
