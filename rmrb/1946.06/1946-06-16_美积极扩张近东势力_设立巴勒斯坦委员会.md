Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 13th: Washington dispatch: U.S. President Truman appointed a Palestine problem committee on the 21st, responsible for helping the U.S. government formulate and implement policies on the Palestine issue, and authorized the committee to negotiate with Britain and other governments. The committee includes Secretary of State Byrnes, Secretary of the Army Patterson, and Secretary of the Treasury Snyder. On the same day, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes stated at a press conference that the United States is actively supporting the immigration of 100,000 Jewish refugees into Palestine and hopes that the British side will agree soon. Byrnes said that the British side has now raised six difficult questions to the U.S. government, the most important of which is what kind of assistance the U.S. will provide for the chaos caused by immigration in Palestine. Several months ago, under pressure from the United States, Britain agreed to allow 100,000 Jews (with U.S. capital backing) to immigrate to Palestine, but later made various excuses to delay. The above actions are clear evidence of the active infiltration of U.S. forces into the Middle East.

    美积极扩张近东势力
    设立巴勒斯坦委员会
    【新华社延安十三日电】华盛顿讯：美总统杜鲁门于二十一日委任一巴勒斯坦问题委员会，负责帮助美政府制定与执行对巴勒斯坦问题的政策，并授权该委会与英国及其他政府谈判。委员包括国务卿贝纳斯、陆长柏尔逊及财长史尼德。同日，美国务卿贝纳斯在记者招待会上表示，美国正积极支持十万犹太难民移入巴勒斯坦，并希望英方很快同意。贝纳斯说：现英方已提出六点疑难交与美政府，最主要的是美方对于巴勒斯坦由于移民所造成的混乱，将予以何种帮助。按数月前，英国在美国压力下，曾同意十万犹太人（有美国资本背景者）移入巴勒斯坦，后又多方推诿。上述行动，为美国势力积极渗入中东之明证。
