Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th: TASS, London: A mass rally celebrating the fourth anniversary of the Anglo-Soviet alliance was held in London on the 26th. Many famous writers, professors, and social figures delivered speeches at the rally, unanimously emphasizing that the friendship between the peoples of the two countries, based on the Anglo-Soviet treaty, was one of the greatest factors in the victory of the war, and that only such friendship is a reliable guarantee of peace and security. The writer Sloce said: Britain's agreement to keep the atomic bomb secret and its refusal to cooperate with the Soviet Union in punishing the remaining fascists undermined the Anglo-Soviet treaty. The female writer, Belray, called on the British people to fight against anti-Soviet propaganda in Britain. She said: The security of Britain is mainly due to the bravery and sacrifice of the Red Army. She asked: Has Britain forgotten its wartime crisis? Have they forgotten that during the days of Stalingrad, the Soviet people defended their country and Britain with their lives? At that time, were not all of us friends of the Soviet Union? If we tolerate anti-Soviet arguments without protesting, wouldn't we be letting down our friends? Shirley concluded by saying: Without the Soviet people, Britain could not have won the war, nor can it prevent a new war. The conference passed a resolution demanding that the British government implement policies consistent with the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty.

    伦敦庆祝苏英同盟群众大会
    坚主加强英苏人民友谊
    女作家雪尔莱说：英国的安全，主要是红军英勇牺牲赢得的。
    【新华社延安三十日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：伦敦庆祝苏英同盟四周年的群众大会，于二十六日举行，许多名作家、教授、与社会名流，在大会上发表演说，一致强调建立在英苏条约上的两国人民的友谊，是战争胜利的最大因素之一，也只有这种友谊才是和平安全的可靠保证。作家斯洛思说：英国同意保守原子弹秘密，并拒绝与苏联合作制裁法西斯残余分子，这样便破坏了英苏条约。女作家贝尔莱呼吁英人与英国的反苏宣传作斗争。她说：英国的安全，主要是由于红军的英勇与牺牲。她问道：英国已忘了其战时危境吗？他们忘了斯大林格勒日子里，苏联人民以死来保卫他们的国家和英国吗？那个时候，我们一切人不都是苏联的朋友吗？假使我们容忍反苏论调而不抗议，岂不对不起朋友？雪尔莱结语称：没有苏联人民，英国不能赢得战争，也不能阻止新的战争。大会通过决议，要求英政府执行与英苏同盟条约相符的政策。
