    Organs, Schools, Troops, and Masses Mobilized
    Taiyue and Southern Hebei Launch a Blitz for Wheat Harvest
    Southern Hebei Organizes a Massive Summer Harvest Labor Exchange
    [This newspaper Yangcheng 3rd dispatch] The masses in the Taiyue area are now tensely entering the wheat harvest. The 50 million mu of wheat seedlings in the area suffered from yellowing and black rust due to continuous spring and summer rains, but the impact was not significant, and the wheat kernels are still relatively plump. In areas such as Shimin, Yangcheng, and Jiyuan, this summer's wheat yield is still expected to average one shi per mu. The wheat harvest campaign has now fully unfolded. Jiyuan, Mengxian, Wangwu, Yuanqu, Pinglu, Xiaxian, Anyi, Guanxi, Quwo, Linfen, ＠洞, Huoxian and other counties have entered a tense stage. The colder mountainous areas such as Yangcheng County are also carrying out various wheat harvest preparations. Yangcheng flattened its threshing floors a week ago, and primary schools at all levels have also been given wheat harvest holidays of ten days to half a month to help families with the wheat harvest. In markets in Yangcheng, Jincheng, and other counties, sickles and sickle handles are selling extremely quickly, and the masses' excitement is overflowing. The wheat harvest work in the border areas is now also being combined with armed forces to implement quick reaping, quick threshing, and quick storage. In Cuijiahe, Guozhong, Nanbeidahei and other villages in the second district of Xiaxian County, village command posts have been restored, sentries are strengthened day and night, and militia self-defense teams patrol back and forth at night, and a rotation warfare team has been established. At the same time, the militia also participates in mutual aid to ensure that the wheat harvest is not affected. Liuyuan United Defense Village in the heart of Jiyuan formed a summer harvest commando team on the 26th of last month to help the masses in the border areas with the summer harvest in Liuzhuang and other areas. The movement to protect the wheat harvest is now being carried out enthusiastically everywhere.
    [This newspaper Weixian 3rd dispatch] This year's wheat harvest is promising. Various places have organized large-scale mutual aid and labor exchange to complete the wheat harvest task. In Weixian County, twelve mutual aid teams in Lutai and the Shengfotang Mutual Aid Brigade, and the entire village of Huguanzhuang in Linqing implemented a large-scale labor exchange, and have been discussing the method of calculating work for the wheat harvest for days, based on the principle of mutual aid, mutual benefit, equal value exchange, and no one suffers losses. After discussion, harvesting has begun. The Xiqifang Suijialu Mutual Aid Team in the second district of Qiuxian County held a meeting on April 17 to study the blitz for the wheat harvest. The entire team planted a total of 80 mu of wheat. With everyone's efforts, the wheat can be threshed in two days, and six people can complete it in four days. The remaining five people will do short-term work in other villages, and they can earn a salary of 2 shi, which can be used as a sideline capital after the wheat harvest. In addition, the Judicial Team of the Jianguo Academy convened a temporary committee on May 26 to study this year's wheat harvest work, calling for everyone to mobilize and blitz the harvest, and help the masses harvest for two days. The Jinnan Daily held a production committee on the 1st to discuss helping the families of martyrs and soldiers, the elderly, the weak, the widowed, and landlords to harvest wheat, and on the 2nd, they were divided into groups to go to the fields to help harvest.

    【本报阳城三日电】太岳全区群众，现正紧张进入麦收。该区五千万亩麦苗，曾因春夏雨水连绵，普遍发生黄疸、黑疸病，但影响不大，麦籽颗粒还算壮实。士敏、阳城、济源等地，今年夏麦每亩平均仍可收一石。现麦收运动已全面展开，济源、孟县、王屋、垣曲、平陆、夏县、安邑、关喜、曲沃、临汾、＠洞、霍县等县，已进入紧张阶段，较寒冷的山岳地区如阳城等县，亦正进行各项麦收准备工作。阳城在一周前，即将麦场平好，各级小学亦放麦假十天至半月，帮助家庭麦收。阳城、晋城等县各集市，镰刀、镰把销售极快，群众兴奋情绪溢于言表。边沿区的麦收工作，现亦正与武装相结合，实行快收、快打、快藏。夏县二区崔家河、郭中、南北大黑等村，已恢复村指挥部，昼夜加强岗哨，黑夜并由民兵自卫队来回巡察，并建立轮战队。同时民兵亦参加互助，以保证不影响麦收。济源腹心地区的柳园联防村，并于上月二十六日组成夏收突击队，到留庄一带，帮助边沿区群众夏收，现各地保卫麦收运动，正热烈开展。
    【本报威县三日电】今年麦收有望，各地纷纷组织互助大变工，以完成麦收任务。威县陆台十二个互助组和圣佛堂互助大队、临清胡官庄全村实行大变工，连日讨论麦收计工办法，以互助互利等价交换互不吃亏为原则。讨论后，已开始收割。邱县二区西七方睢家禄互助组，四月十七日开会研究突击麦收，全组共种麦子八十亩，大家下手，两天可打完麦子，六人四天可完成。剩下五人给外村打短工，四天能得工资二市石，可作麦收后副业资本。又建国学院司法队，于五月二十六日召开临时委员会，研究今年的麦收工作，要一齐动员起来，突击收割，并帮助群众收割两天。冀南日报社，于一日召开生产委员会，商讨帮助抗属老弱孤寡房东收割麦子，二日已分组下地帮助收割。
