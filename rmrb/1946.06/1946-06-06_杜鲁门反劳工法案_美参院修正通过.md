    杜鲁门反劳工法案
    美参院修正通过
    【新华社延安三日电】据合众社华盛顿讯：杜鲁门反罢工法案，在参院一周激烈辩论后，由于许多议员之反对，于一日晨会议中，作了重要修正后，始以六十一票对二十票通过。杜鲁门所提该法案已被删去如下项目：（１）在矿场或其他各业因工作停顿而危及国家经济时，总统得宣布紧急状态之存在；（２）在政府接管期内，政府有权确定复工期限、工资及工作条件，如职员与工会领袖不合作者，可处以五千元以下罚金及一年以下徒刑；（３）政府接管工业中罢工工人征服军役之权；（４）在政府经管期间继续罢工的职工，在政府管制终了后，丧失其工作权；（５）在赔偿业主于政府经营期间的损失后，红利转归财政部。据称参院已将该案退回众院，众院可能全部接受该项修正。
