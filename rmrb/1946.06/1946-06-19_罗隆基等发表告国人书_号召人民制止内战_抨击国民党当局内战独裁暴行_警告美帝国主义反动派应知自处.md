Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Chongqing News: Prominent figures from all walks of life, including Luo Longji and Shen Tilan, and 89 others, jointly published an open letter to the nation at the end of May, calling on the people to resolutely stop the Kuomintang authorities from expanding the civil war and carrying out dictatorial atrocities. The letter stated: "More than four months after the closing of the Political Consultative Conference, the four promises and three agreements have been completely destroyed." The letter pointed out: "The CCP troops withdrew from Changchun this month (May), and the National Army entered the next day. The person in charge of the government has repeatedly stated that negotiations can be reopened after the National Army enters Changchun. However, after entering Changchun, they again clamored that they must use force to recover Harbin, Qiqihar, Andong and other cities. This is clear evidence of expanding the civil war willfully... What is even more advanced is that the current government has stopped all sea, land, and air transportation tools for civilian use and specializes in transporting military equipment and ammunition from Sichuan and Yunnan to expand and strengthen the civil war forces, making it impossible for displaced people to return to their hometowns or their homes. They also transport military grain under the name of transporting grain to relieve famine. The foreign war has long ended, but recently, high school graduates have been recruited and subjected to compulsory military training to enslave young people and destroy education. All these are measures to actively carry out the civil war. Relief creates disasters, famine creates famine, obstructs transportation, promotes price increases, cuts off the people's livelihoods, and plunges the country into desperation. Our people across the country are resolutely opposed to this." The letter warned the imperialist reactionaries: "The Northeast is not a colony of another country. Now that the Soviet army has completely withdrawn from the Northeast, other friendly countries should respect China's freedom and should know their place. First, do not get involved in China's civil war vortex, immediately withdraw troops, and immediately stop transporting troops and equipment unilaterally. Second, do not use military equipment and ammunition for Chinese to kill each other, to fuel China's civil war." Regarding the Kuomintang's rampant implementation of fascist dictatorship, the letter stated: "The government is about to implement the 'police officer police district' system. This system is a vicious system used by monarchical autocratic countries such as Japan, Prussia, and Tsarist Russia to enslave the people, and it is also a cruel facility used by fascists to oppress and rule the people. It treats the people like slaves, and turns special agents into police officers. It not only completely deprives the people of their freedom, but also deprives them of their personality. What cannot be tolerated about this!" Finally, the letter called on the people across the country: "Unite and rise up together, and vow to fight to the death to restore the country's peace and realize the country's democracy." The signatories included Luo Longji, Standing Committee member of the China Democratic League; Shi Liang, a famous lawyer; Xian Ying, the former host of the Xinshu Newspaper; Deng Chumin, Zhou Xinmin, Wu Han, and other famous professors; Zhang Xueyan, editor-in-chief of Tianjia Bimonthly; Wu Zaoqi, a natural scientist; and Shen Tilan, Dean of Students of Yenching University, and 89 others.

    抨击国民党当局内战独裁暴行
    警告美帝国主义反动派应知自处
    【新华社延安十六日电】渝讯：各界名流罗隆基、沈体兰等八十九人，于五月末联名发表告国人书，号召人民坚决制止国民党当局扩大内战，厉行独裁的暴行。该件称：政协闭幕四个多月来，四项诺言三大协定被破坏无遗。该件指出：“中共部队已于本月（五月）退出长春，国军已于次日进入。政府负责人曾屡次宣称，国军进入长春后，即可重开谈判。乃既进长春以后，又复扬言必武力收复哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、安东等城，此实为一意孤行扩大内战之明证。……更有进者，目前政府将一切海陆空交通工具，停止民运，专以运输川、滇各区军械军火，以扩大加强内战力量，使流离失所之人民有乡不能回，有家不能归。又假运粮救荒之名，行运输军粮之实。对外战争早已结束，近又征集高中毕业生，施以强迫军事训练，奴化青年摧残教育。凡此种种均为积极进行内战之措施。救灾造灾，救荒造荒，窒碍交通，助长物介，断人民之生路，陷国家于绝境。我全国人民实一致坚决反对。”该件警告帝国主义反动派称：“东北非别国之殖民地。今者苏军既已完全撤出东北，其他友邦果尊重中国之自由，亦应知自处。第一，不牵涉于中国内战漩涡之内，立刻撤军，立刻停止为单方面运军运械。第二，不以军械军火，代中国人自相残杀之用，以助长中国之内战。”关于国民党当避厉行法西斯独裁，该件称：“政府行将实施‘警员警管区’制度，此制实日本、普鲁士、帝俄等君主专制国家奴役人民之恶毒制度，亦为法西斯主义者，压迫统治人民之残酷设施。视人民如奴隶，变特务为警员，不特完全剥夺人民之自由，抑且剥夺人民之人格。此而可忍，孰不可忍！””最后该件号召全国人民：“一致共起，誓死力争，以恢复国家之和平，实现国家之民主。”签名者民盟常委罗隆基、名律师史良、前新蜀报主持人鲜英、著名教授邓初民、周新民、吴晗等、田家半月刊主编张雪岩、自然科学家吴藻溪，燕京大学训导长沈体兰等八十九人。
