    The Reborn Jifeng Flour Company
    Yu Yiping
    Starting from History
    As Mr. Lin Luqing of the company said, "Since the founding of Jifeng Factory in the sixth year of the Republic of China, it has always had bad luck, weathering six major setbacks amidst the turmoil."
    In the winter of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the company began its first shutdown because of a shortage of funds and inability to obtain loans. In the autumn of the seventeenth year, it was confiscated once by Liang Guanying (Governor of Shandong Province). In the autumn of the eighteenth year, Han Fuqu forcibly incorporated it into the Grain and Forage Factory. The warlords fought north and south, and whoever came would call it "official" "rebel property." The company's shareholders never truly had control. Therefore, the owners, disturbed by the years of civil war and unable to manage, simply sold all the machinery and real estate on a fixed-term basis. In the autumn of the nineteenth year, it was leased to Baoxing Flour Mill in Xuzhou. In the spring of the twenty-fourth year, it was sold to a wealthy capitalist named Ding from Wuxi. In the first month of the twenty-third year, along with the entire national disaster, under the howling of "compulsory military management," it fell into the hands of the Japanese "Garrison." In February of the thirtieth year, all management power was completely controlled by the "Imperial Army." Jifeng Flour Company has always suffered miserably in such a fate.
    A Whole Year
    The flour factory stopped production on April 12th last year and started its machines on April 10th this year, a full year.
    Last spring, the Japanese devils used the rails from the Mengji Railway to repair the Jinpu Railway, and the machines of Jifeng Factory finally ceased their roar.
    After the unconditional surrender of the Japanese invaders in September, the traitors, under the protection of the "Underground National Army," transported all the parts, machine rooms, and metal materials of the flour factory to Jinan, attempting to move them back to Japan, leaving all the staff and workers displaced.
    On January 11th, the banner of liberation was raised over Jining City, and the dawn of a new China also shone on the ancient Jifeng Factory. Subsequently, the democratic government actively sought to investigate every difficulty in the company's resumption of work, organizing staff to negotiate the return of some necessary equipment from Jinan. Then, the bank and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce busily tried to help solve all the factory's difficulties. Since its inception, this was the first time Jifeng had received the government's care, love, and warmth!
    The new shareholder, Peng Heji, hired Manager Fang from the bank to mediate a joint venture. With the consent of both the old and new shareholders, all the original factory's machinery and real estate were valued at 510,000 yuan at the original price. According to the silver dollar exchange rate and the condition of the machinery, it was converted into 35 million yuan in local currency as the original capital. The new shareholders then invested the same amount of capital to establish Jifeng Heji Joint Stock Flour Company.
    Then, the staff and workers raised funds and chose an auspicious day to open, and the complete set of machinery of Jifeng Factory began to roar magnificently again.
    Comparing Two Mirrors
    After the start of work, the Jifeng workers are industrious everywhere, and laughter is everywhere. Old Xue, a colleague, not knowing whether to envy or doubt, suddenly asked me, "Why are the workers so happy?" Yes, they have never been as truly the free masters of the world as they are today. In a conversation in the reception room, old leader Mr. Zhang Liming told me, "In short, both the owner and the workers are happy now." Like the factory's wet nurse, he came from Shanghai with the machinery when the company was established. Talking about everything that had happened in the factory over the past thirty years, it all seemed like yesterday. From fragmented conversations with various workers and staff, I understood even more the meaning of the phrase "both sides are happy." For example, the treatment of workers has always been extremely meager, especially during the eight years of enemy and puppet rule. Wages were calculated in banknotes, and the increase in wages was always "lagging far behind" the soaring prices. The workers were always plagued by hunger and cold. Based on the price of flour at 1,600 yuan per bag at the time and 2,100 yuan per bag in winter, as the standard for changes in various price indices, the so-called "golden age" of workers saw wages from a maximum of 8,480 yuan per month to a minimum of 6,620 yuan. Today, wages range from a minimum of 7,760 yuan per month to a maximum of 10,500 yuan (excluding meals). Workers, when discussing their meals at lunchtime, mentioned that in the past they only ate cold steamed buns, not even pickles. Now they have top-quality white steamed buns for three meals a day, with 10 yuan per day for food expenses. Eating their meals sitting properly, eight people at a table, they feel that their personality has also improved a lot. When asked whether the factory was profitable, Mr. Lin, the person in charge of the company, replied very affirmatively. He said, "Since its inception, Jifeng has rarely produced more than 830 bags per day. Now, there are still 17 staff, 3 foremen, and 75 workers. The number of workers has not increased. Only twelve grinding wheels are used. After the capital increase, the daily output is generally around 900 bags, and sometimes even exceeds 1,130 bags. We are definitely making money!" Theft, damage to parts, slowdowns, and waste of machine oil... These have always been forms of struggle for workers to resist the factory. Now, this abnormal labor-capital relationship is completely gone. Mr. Lin said, "Take theft as an example. In the past, no matter how much we searched and supervised, it was difficult to avoid it. Now, we let the workers leave the factory at will after work. The workers consciously guarantee that you won't be missing an ounce of flour, which really saves a lot of trouble." Worker Geng Chuanhua's finger was crushed by a machine and the bone exposed the day before yesterday at noon. The factory sent him to a nearby hospital and spent several hundred yuan on treatment, instructing him to rest well for a few days. But yesterday morning, he bandaged his wound and limped back to the machine room. Everyone advised him to rest because of excessive bleeding, but he felt that in the past, the factory had never cared about the workers, letting them starve and die at home. Now, laborers have legal protection, and the owner treats them very well. It would be against his conscience not to work. Both the owner and the workers believe that everything is reasonable now. The workers say, "Wage assessment, convening meetings, everyone can say what they want. This is truly democracy and freedom." Mr. Ji Hequn, another person in charge of the factory, painted a bright future for Jifeng. He affirmed with confidence, "We fully understand the government's guiding principle of developing private capital. Jifeng is now protected and supported by the democratic government, which has laid a solid foundation for unlimited prospects. After the new wheat comes down, the factory will operate day and night shifts to earn more money. We will successively convene shareholders' meetings, workers' meetings, and formulate factory regulations, labor protection regulations, and gradually establish workers' schools, workers' hospitals, workers' dormitories, and workers' clubs, building Jifeng into the most complete factory in the border region."

    新生中的济丰面粉公司
    余一平
    从历史谈起
    正如公司林鲁卿先生所说的一样，“济丰工厂从民国六年创办起，总是那样命运不佳，在风雨飘摇中前后度过六次波折。”
    民国十六年的冬天，该公司因为资金短少周转不开，到处告贷无门，而开始了第一次的停工。十七年秋，为梁冠英——（山东省长）没收过一次，十八年秋，韩复渠强迫并入粮秣厂。军阀们南征北战，谁来了都要说是“官办”的“逆产”，公司的股东却没有做过真正的主人，于是老板们对连年内战不胜其扰，无法经营，干脆把全部机器房产定期出卖给别人了。十九年的秋天，是租给徐州宝兴面粉厂，二十四年春，是卖给无锡大资本家丁某，到了二十三年正月，随着整个的民族灾难，在“强行军事管理”的狂叫下面，沦陷于日本“驻屯军”手中了。三十年二月，一切经营大权即完全掌握在“皇军”手中了。济丰面粉公司总是在这样的命运中惨度着。
    整整一个年头
    面粉工厂是去年四月十二日停工的，到今年四月十日开动机器，整整一年。
    去年春天鬼子把猛济铁道的铁轨补到津浦路上去，济丰工厂的机器也最后停止它的吼声了。
    九月里日寇宣布无条件投降之后，汉奸又在“地下国军”的庇护下面，把面粉工厂的全套零件、机器房、材料库的全部五金资材运到济南，企图搬回日本，可怜的是全部职员和工人们都流离失所了。
    一月十一号济宁城上竖起解放大旗，祖国新生的曙光也照射到这古老的济丰工厂。接着民主政府纷纷征询调查该公司复工的每一条困难，组织职员去济南交涉回一些必要的器材。接着银行、工商局忙着就工厂全部困难而极力设法帮助解决。济丰自有生以来，这是第一次取到政府的关心爱护和温暖呀！
    新股东彭和记聘请银行的方经理，来做调说入伙合办的中间人，在新旧股东双方乐意下面，原厂全部机器房产均按原价五十一万元，依银元比值变化与机器新旧成色，评折为原资金鲁钞三千五百万元，再由新股东投入同数资金，成立济丰和记股份有限面粉公司。
    于是募捐职员工人择吉开张，济丰工厂的全套机器又开始放出雄壮的吼声。
    两面镜子对照一下
    开工后的济丰工人，到处是勤劳的工作，到处是欢乐的笑声，同行的老薛不知道是称羡还是疑惑，突然问我：“您看工人为啥这样乐？”是的，他们从来没有象今天这样真正做世界上自由的主人，在会客室的谈叙中，老领袖张立明先生告诉我，“总之现在是东家工人两面都开心。”他象这工人的乳母，从公司建立就随机器一块从上海来的，谈起这工厂三十年间的一切过去的事，都历历在昨，从各方工人职员的零碎谈叙里，我更理解到“两面都开心”那一句话的内容。譬如工人待遇，向来是极其菲薄的，特别是敌伪统治的八年，工资按钞票计算，工资的增加终是对物价的飞涨是“望尘莫及”的，工人们终年是饥寒交迫，按当时面粉每袋一千六百元，和冬天每袋二千一百元，来做各种物价指数变动的标准，当年所谓工人的“黄金时代”，工资由最高的每月八千四百八十元到最低的六千六百二十元，而今日即由最低每月七千七百六十元，最高每月一万零五百元（吃食在外），工人们在午餐时谈起从前全吃冷馍，连咸菜都没有，现在每天三顿上等白馍，每天十块钱的菜金，吃饭时都端端正正坐着，八个人一席，就觉到自己连人格也提高得多了。在谈到厂方是否有利可图时，公司负责人林先生的答复是非常肯定的，他说：“济丰从创办以来每天产量很少超过八百三十袋，现在还是十七位职员，三个领班，七十五位工人，人工全没增加，只动十二盘磨，增资以后每天产量一般是九百袋上下，多少时候还超过一千一百三十袋，我们赚钱是一定的！”偷窃，破坏零件，怠工，浪费机油，………向来是工人反抗厂方的斗争形式，现在这种不正常的劳资关系完全没有了。林先生说：“就拿盗窃来举例，过去无论怎样搜身监工也难避免，现我们放工就任工人随便出厂了，工人们自觉到包叫你不少一两面粉，真省掉许多麻烦”。工人耿传华先生前天午间，被机器把手指轧破露出骨头了，厂方把他送到附近医院花了几百块钱医治，嘱他好好休息几天，但他昨天清早又包扎了伤口，拐回机器房了。大家劝他流血过多应该休息，他却觉得从前的病，厂方就没理会过工人，就任你在家里饿着病死，现在劳工有了法律保护，东家对自己很好，不干活也对不起良心。东家工人都认为现在一切事情才是合理的，工人说：“评定工资，召集会议，大家有话都可以说，这真是民主自由。”厂方另一负责人吉合群先生，他给济丰描绘了一幅光辉的远景。他肯定有力地说：“我们完全体会政府发展私人资本的主旨，济丰现在受到民主政府的保护扶助，才奠定了前途不再限量的巩固基础。新麦下来以后，工厂将昼夜开班赚更多的钱，我们将陆续召开股东会议、工人会议、制定厂章、厂规、劳工保护条例，逐步创立工人学校、工人医院、工人宿舍、工人俱乐部，把济丰建设成为边区规模最完善的工厂。”
