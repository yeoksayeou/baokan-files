[Heze News from this newspaper] After the commencement of the Yellow River's old course restoration project in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, the Kuomintang government has yet to allocate relocation relief funds. Over 360,000 residents in 1,026 old and new villages within the old riverbed are trapped, unable to relocate, and in extreme panic. Although a small number have moved elsewhere, several families are crowded into small thatched huts, without any fields or property, making it impossible to sustain their lives. Residents along the river have successively sent representatives to petition the democratic government, demanding that the Kuomintang government implement the Nanjing agreement and promptly allocate relocation relief funds. Dai Panzhou and Zhao Jingyi, representatives from Kunshan County (western Dongping), arrived at the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office a few days ago. Representing 200,000 people from the entire county, in addition to requesting relief, they also requested that the National Government simultaneously construct the Grand Canal levee south of the old course and the Daicun Dam in Dongping, and the Hejia Dam in Wenshang County, to prevent the inevitable flooding disasters after the Yellow River returns to its old course.

    房田俱无恐慌万状
    旧河道内卅六万居民
    要求速拨迁移救济费
    【本报荷泽讯】冀鲁豫区黄河故道复堤工程开工后，国民党政府至今仍未拨发迁移救济费，旧河道内一千零二十六个新旧村庄的三十六万余居民，困于无力迁移而极端恐慌，虽有少数已迁至他处，但数户集居一小草舍内，田产俱无，生活无法维持，沿河居民纷纷推派代表，向民主政府请愿，要求国民党政府执行南京协议，迅予拨发迁移救济费。昆山县（东平西部）代表戴泮州，赵敬一等三人于日前抵冀鲁豫行署，代表全县二十万人民除要求救济外，并请向国民政府要求同时修筑故道以南之运河堤岸与东平之戴村坝，汶上县之何家坝，以免黄河归故后必然引起之泛滥灾害。
