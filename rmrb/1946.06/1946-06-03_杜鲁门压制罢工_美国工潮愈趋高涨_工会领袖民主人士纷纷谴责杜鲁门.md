Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, May 30th: Washington dispatch: President Truman's speech in Congress on the 25th, which aimed to deprive workers of the right to strike, and the subsequent passage of the anti-labor bill by the House of Representatives, have provoked great indignation and a chorus of protests among leaders of major labor unions, progressive groups, and Democrats in the United States.

	On the workers' front, 400,000 coal miners continued their strike until midnight on the 28th, defying government threats. On the 27th, coal miners in Tolt, Washington, spontaneously walked off the job to protest government oppression and interference. The New York Industrial Union Council and the General Strike Strategy Committee of the Labor Federation ordered 48,000 transportation workers in the city of Rochester, with a population of 320,000, to strike on the 28th. Workers held demonstrations, strongly protesting the municipal authorities' ban on strikes. The upcoming national seamen's strike will proceed on schedule, regardless of government interference, and will not stop until the goals of wage increases and improved working conditions are achieved.

	Regarding union leaders, according to an Associated Press report from Washington on the 28th, CIO President Murray, in a telegram to all senators, sternly criticized: "In a frenzy of hysteria, there is an attempt to use congressional legislation to destroy our country's labor movement." AFL President Green stated that Truman's program was "advocating the enslavement of labor under a fascist system." The United Auto Workers, affiliated with the CIO, telegraphed Murray, urging him to take immediate measures to unite all organized workers in a common action to defeat Truman's proposals. The National Farmers Union criticized Truman's program as "open and blatant fascism." The Associated Press reported that major unions hinted that they would turn to support Wallace or Pepper for the next presidential election. According to a United Press report, Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen President Whitney declared a "political war" against Truman, asserting: "If Truman runs for president in the 1948 election, we pledge to use the Brotherhood's entire $47 million fund to defeat him." The president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, who stopped the strike due to Truman's oppression, condemned "Truman as a political opportunist who will definitely not be president again after 1948."

	Regarding progressive groups and Democrats, according to Associated Press dispatches from Washington on the 28th and 29th, former Interior Secretary Ickes, chairman of the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions, declared on the 29th: "Truman's legislative demands are the most serious attack on the fundamental rights of American labor and democratic traditions ever seen." The National Citizens Political Action Committee issued a statement condemning Truman's proposals as "totalitarian." According to another United Press report, 42 influential senators opposed the House's passage of granting Truman emergency powers to deal with strikes on the 27th. Opponents argued that "this is punishing crimes before they are committed." It is expected that Truman's anti-strike proposals will face increasingly fierce battles in the Senate.
