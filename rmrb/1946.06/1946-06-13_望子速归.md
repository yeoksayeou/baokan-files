    Hoping for My Son's Speedy Return
    Liu Wangliming
    Three or four years ago,
    For family and national hatred,
    In the Senate,
    I suggested conscripting educated youth,
    And set an example by sending my two sons to the army—
    The younger one went to the Chengdu Central Military Academy,
    The elder one entered the Army Mechanization School in Shuangjiang Town, Yunnan.
    Last year, one graduated, the enemy has already surrendered,
    But military rules are strict, still ordered on a long march!?
    A vast future, going to fight death,
    A chill in my heart, I couldn't help but shed hot tears at parting.
    Instantly reaching the Great Wall,
    Outside the pass, everywhere ice and snow, chilling to the bone,
    Surrounded by people forced to be enemies,
    A scene of incessant fighting!
    On Tiger Mountain,
    Family letters are withheld,
    The wanderer misses his family,
    Unexpectedly, after victory, there is such strange behavior!
    Millions of mothers are sick with longing for their sons,
    The Northeast needs peace and stability even more!
    Hoping my son will return quickly for a reunion!

    望子速归
    刘王立明
    三四年前，
    为了家仇国恨，
    在参议会里，
    曾建议征用知识青年，
    一面以身作则命二子从军——
    小的投成都中央军校，
    大的入陆军机械化学校于滇南双江镇。
    去年毕业了一个，敌人业已投降，
    然军规森严，仍旧是奉命长征！？
    前程万里，去与死亡搏斗，
    一阵心寒，别时禁不住全家热泪抛滚。
    霎时即抵万里长城，
    关外满处冰雪冷气逼人，
    四周逼人民为敌，
    一片厮杀之声！
    打虎山上，
    家书被扣，
    游子思亲，
    想不到胜利后尚有这样的怪行！
    千百万母亲思子成疾，
    东北更需要和平，安定！
    望儿速归重相逢！
