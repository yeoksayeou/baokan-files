    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th -- In Finland and Romania, movements against reactionary elements and fascist remnants are vigorously developing. A wave of mass rallies in Finland demanding the purging of reactionary elements from administrative organs has spread throughout the country. On June 5th, a rally in Ypäjäs gathered more than 10,000 participants. Mass rallies in Kemi, Lapland, Pori and other places have also passed resolutions submitted to the government and parliament. In Helsinki, the Finnish capital, a congress composed of representatives elected from 200 mass rallies in the Lapland region passed a resolution demanding a complete halt to the activities of reactionaries throughout the country and the complete destruction of fascism. It also demanded the completion of land reform, the nationalization of banks, export industries, and insurance companies, as well as the purging of anti-democratic elements in public and private institutions. Romanian newspapers reported that public security and national police agencies have discovered several terrorist groups within Romania calling themselves "National Resistance Movement" and "Black Vest Division." These groups are all connected and have a leading central organization. Among the leaders of these groups who have been arrested are General Aventia and Irville, an employee of the US mission to Romania, and ten others. The National Congress of Democratic Students of Romania, recently held in Bucharest, appealed to students across the country to fight against reactionaries such as Maniu and Bratianu.
