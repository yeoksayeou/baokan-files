    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Chongqing reliable sources say that the United States has now decided to order its navy stationed in China to transport the three divisions of the 54th Army of the Kuomintang, under the command of Que Hanqian, concentrated in Kowloon, to the Northeast civil war front in early June. Previously, the three divisions of the 53rd Army of the Kuomintang, under the command of Zhou Fucheng, stationed in Vietnam, had already been decided by the United States to be transported north from Haiphong in order to carry out Chiang Kai-shek's nationwide civil war plan. Observers at home and abroad believe that this policy of the United States is not only an active cooperation with Chiang Kai-shek's civil war policy, but also a frenzied instigation. Chiang Kai-shek's unrestricted expansion of the civil war in the Northeast, and his igniting of the flames of nationwide civil war in eastern Hebei, central Hebei, and central Anhui, are precisely the result of the long-term stationing of American troops in China without withdrawal, and the consistent and frenzied military assistance to Chiang Kai-shek's war-mongering clique.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: In order to help Chiang Kai-shek expand the civil war, in addition to delivering the first batch of eight landing ships to Chiang's side, the United States is also vigorously assisting Chiang Kai-shek in training drivers. According to a dispatch from Qingdao on the 26th by the Central News Agency, these personnel, with the assistance of American advisors, have trained 600 intermediate-level cadres in Qingdao, who are being assigned to serve on landing craft. After the members of the Kuomintang's "Central Naval Training Corps" graduate, they will receive further training in Qingdao.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Reuters, Moscow: The New Era magazine published an article on the 2nd, condemning the U.S. military for "actively participating in the Chinese civil war." The article pointed out that the Soviet army had withdrawn from Chinese territory on schedule in accordance with the Moscow Agreement. The article criticized the Chiang Kai-shek government's policy towards Manchuria, saying: "The suppression of the political initiative of the Manchurian people, who have been liberated from long-term enslavement, is tying new and extremely complex knots in domestic political contradictions." It also pointed out that the Chinese Kuomintang army relies on military equipment supplied by the United States, giving it a military advantage at the moment. The article concluded: "The current situation in China depends on whether the government changes its policy and replaces force with political methods to resolve disputes."

    美国助蒋扩大内战
    继续海运国民党军赴东北
    力助蒋介石训练海军干部
    【新华社延安二日电】渝确息：美国现又决定令其驻华海军，将集中于九龙的国民党五十四军阙汉骞部三个师，于六月初运往东北的内战前线。按现驻越南的国民党五十三军周福成部三个师，前已由美国决定由海防北运，以便执行蒋介石的全国大内战计划。中外观察家咸信，美国此种政策，对于蒋介石的内战政策，不但是一种积极的合作，而且是一种狂烈的煽动。蒋介石现在东北无限制的扩大内战，并在冀东、冀中、皖中各区，点起全国内战的火焰，正是美军长驻中国不退，并对蒋介石好战集团实行一贯的狂烈的军事援助的结果。
    【新华社延安三日电】美国为帮助蒋介石扩大内战，除将登陆舰艇第一批八艘已交付蒋方外，并力助蒋介石训练驾驶人员。据中央社青岛二十六日电讯泄露，该项人员在美顾问协助下，已在青岛训练出中级干部六百人，分往登陆艇服务。国民党之“中央海军训练团”团员毕业后，再到青岛受训。
    【新华社延安三日电】路透社莫斯科讯：新时代杂志二日撰文，谴责美军“积极参加中国内战”，该文指出苏军依照莫斯科协定已按期由中国领土撤退，该文抨击蒋介石政府对满洲的政策称：“对于由长久奴役中解放出来之满洲人民的政治动议权，实行镇压政策，是在国内政治矛盾中打着新的与极为复杂的结子”。并指出中国国民党军队依赖于美国供应的军备，使刻在军事上占优势。该文结语称：“中国目前的形势，决定于政府是否改变其政策，并以政治方法代替武力来解决争执问题。”
