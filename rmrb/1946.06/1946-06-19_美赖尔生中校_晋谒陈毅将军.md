Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 16th. Colonel Hao Ding, staff officer of the Nanjing Communist Party Delegation, and Shen Ye, member of the foreign affairs group, accompanied Lieutenant Colonel Rielson of the U.S. Marine Corps to arrive here from Qingdao on the morning of the 13th at 10:00 AM. The Communist Party Delegation personnel made this trip under the orders of Comrade Zhou Enlai to pay respects to Commander Chen Yi. Lieutenant Colonel Rielson represents Rear Admiral Klemens of the U.S. Navy in Qingdao to inquire about the rumors that the Shandong Liberation Army will attack Qingdao and attempt to destroy Qingdao's water source. Commander Chen immediately issued a stern statement that this matter is purely malicious propaganda from the Kuomintang side and completely inconsistent with the facts, and stated: "According to information, the U.S. military will continue to help the Kuomintang army transport the Fourth and Fifty-third Armies to Qingdao by sea. If this is true, it will inevitably expand the civil war in Shandong." At 4:30 PM, Commander Chen specially hosted a banquet at the reception office. At 5:30 PM, the Communist Party Delegation personnel and Lieutenant Colonel Rielson returned to Qingdao by the original plane.

    美赖尔生中校
    晋谒陈毅将军
    【新华社临沂十六日电】南京中共代表团上校参谋郝鼎、外事组员沈野偕美海军陆占队赖尔生中校一行，于十三日上午十时，由青抵此。中共代表团人员此行，系奉周恩来同志命，晋谒陈毅军长。赖尔生中校，系代表青岛美国海军克莱门少将面询外传山东解放军将进攻青岛，图破坏青岛水源事，陈军长当即严正声明，此事纯系国方恶意宣传，与事实完全不符，并称：据息：美军将继续帮助国民党军海运第四军、第五十三军至青岛，果系属实，则势必扩大山东内战。下午四时半陈军长特于交际处设宴招待，至五时半中共代表团人员，与赖尔生中校乘原机返青。
