    Alas! "National Defense"!?

    So, the "Ministry of National Defense" has appeared. Not after the enemy invaded the Northeast, not when the enemy broke through the pass and hacked into North China. Back then, if anyone mentioned a "national defense" government, they risked "drowning themselves." At that time, all that was wanted was "good neighborliness and friendship." But now that Japanese fascism has collapsed, trying to befriend it to oppose the Soviet Union and the Communists is considered less courageous. Thus, the "Ministry of National Defense" has emerged, and it's of immense scale, with seven bureaus and six offices. What exactly is it intended to do?

    The "Chairman" promoted himself to "President," adding an official title for himself. This is already old news. Bai Chongxi raised the banner of "resistance against Japan" in Guangxi in 1936, plotting to split China. This is an even smaller matter. They've long since become allies, wanting to "hook" everyone together to "hook" things up. But the most problematic thing is that China today is indeed much more complex, and the army is also much more complex. There's the "genuine central government," and there are the "miscellaneous central governments" that wholeheartedly obeyed and surrendered to the enemy, and then there are the miscellaneous brands that didn't wholeheartedly surrender to the central government, and there's the "underground central government" (i.e., puppet troops), and even "technical personnel," or those who call themselves the "Japanese central government," also known as the "troops already sent back home" that don't exist. Setting aside the American "Supreme Emperor Grandfather soldiers," it's truly a colorful spectacle, utterly inexhaustible. Driving them to be enemies of the people, righteous soldiers are unwilling to engage in fratricide, and the people's strength is by no means weak and easy to bully. When fighting breaks out, there will be uprisings here and surrenders there. This has made the three "big shots" anxious and flying all over the place. Not satisfied with flying, the "Ministry of National Defense" has emerged.

    Another aspect of complex China is that more and more people are sleepless and kept awake. The era of securely sucking the people's blood is long gone. Seventy-seven kinds of magazines are sealed up in Beijing. From this perspective, the dictator is overly insane and "brave," but from another perspective, the number and strength of opponents are numerous and strong, and the dictator's trembling fear makes him look like a clown. Unable to win in reasoning, unable to win in writing, the door of democracy is slightly opened, and he catches a cold and has a headache. "I am from the barrel of a gun anyway, military force is the best way." Thus the "Ministry of National Defense" appeared. If you don't believe it, just look at the list: Gu Zhutong, the main culprit of the "Southern Anhui Incident," is now the Commander-in-Chief of the Army; Bai Chongxi, famous for the "He-Bai" reactionary telegram, is now the "Minister of National Defense." As for Chen Cheng and others, their anti-Communist and anti-people labels are so old that everyone knows them, so there's no need to mention them again. This one-party-controlled, anti-people "Ministry of National Defense" is clearly a different matter from the Ministry of National Defense in the Political Consultative Conference resolution, so there's even less need to elaborate.

    However, the people are of course even more aware that within the vast China owned by the vast people who demand democracy, peace, and unity, there is still a tiny "country" that survives by sucking the blood of the Chinese people. What the people love, they hate; what the people hate, they love. Everything is opposite, everything is relative. Puppet troops who don't surrender their guns are given large cakes; puppet troops who surrender are given bombs. You want democracy, they engage in dictatorship; you want peace, they engage in civil war. Although they have stolen the reins of the country, their "country" is actually just a small fascist group, comprador and feudal combined. Therefore, the people of Anshan call it "the second Manchuria." Their "defense" is in "preventing the people from speaking," preventing the tide of democracy. "Alas! National Defense"?!

### 呜呼！“国防”！？

    呜呼！“国防”！？
    居然“国防部”出现了。不在敌人侵入东北之后，不在敌人破关砍入华北之时，那时若有人提“国防”政府，则有“自行落水而死”的危险。当时要的只是“睦邻亲善”，而现在，日本法西斯垮台，再想睦着他以反苏反共，总算气魄小了，于是出现了“国防部”，而且规模庞大，七局六厅，这到底将欲何为？
    “委员长”升了“主席”，自己给自己加官，这已经是往事了；白崇禧三六年在广西打起“抗日”招牌，阴谋分裂中国，这更是小事，早已冰炭相投，要“勾”大家合力“勾”了。而最成问题的，则是目前的中国，确实复杂得多，军队也复杂得多，既有“正牌中央”，又有死心遵命投敌的“杂牌中央”，和并不死心投降中央的杂牌，还有“地下中央”（即伪军），更有“技术人员”，或自称“日本中央”，又名“早已遣送回国”并不存在之部队，权将美国“太上皇爷爷兵”除外，也真是五光十色，不一而足，驱之与民为敌，正义的将士既不忍萁豆相煎，人民力量也绝非软弱可欺，打起来，不是这里起义，便是那里放下武器，于是急得三个“大头子”满天飞，飞之不足，这就出现了“国防部”。
    复杂中国的另一面，是睡不着和不睡着的人多起来了，安稳吸着人血的时代早已过去，北平杂志一封七十七种。从这面看独裁者过于疯狂而“勇敢”，可是从另一面看反对者之多而且强，与独裁者那种害怕得发抖的样子，确实像个小丑，让道理讲不赢，比文章比不赢，民主的门略微一开，就伤风头痛，“老子反正是枪杆子出身，还是武力对待为上”，这就出现了“国防部”，如若不信，只要一看名单：“皖南事变”主犯顾祝同，现任陆军总司令，以“何白”反动通电闻名中外的白崇禧，现任“国防部长”，至于陈诚等反共反人民牌子之老，人所其知，不必再提它。这个一党包办的反人民的“国防部”，与政协决议中的国防部显然是两事，那就更用不着细为交代了。
    然而人民当然更加明白，在偌大的要求民主和平团结的广大人民所拥有的中国之中，尚有一小小“国度”，他们以吸中国人民之血而生存，人之所爱，彼之所恶，人之所恶，彼之所爱，事事相反，时时相对，伪军不交枪投以大饼，伪军投降了投以炸弹，你要民主他搞独裁，你要和平，他搞内战，他们虽然窃了国柄，但他们的“国”实际只是小小的法西斯集团，买办而兼封建，故鞍山老百姓名之曰：“第二个满洲国”，他们的“防”，是在“防民之口”，防民主的潮流，“呜呼！国防”？！
