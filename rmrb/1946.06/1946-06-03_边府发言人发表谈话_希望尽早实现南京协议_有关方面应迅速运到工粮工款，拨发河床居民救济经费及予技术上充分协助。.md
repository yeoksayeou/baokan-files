    [Report from our newspaper in Handan on the 1st] A spokesperson for the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government recently issued a statement to our reporter regarding the Nanjing Agreement, as follows:
    The spokesperson began by stating: "Dredging the river and restoring the dikes first, then relocating and providing relief, before finally blocking the breach and releasing the water, has been our consistent position and demand. This was reflected in the Heze and Kaifeng Agreements. Only in this way can downstream areas be prevented from suffering disasters. This spirit is fully respected and will be vigorously implemented in the current Nanjing Agreement, and we hope that others will do the same. Therefore, we would like to bring the following points to attention:
    (1) Based on historical experience, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the project, we hope that grain, funds, and various materials will be transported quickly, truly achieving that they are 'not obstructed by any political or military considerations.' Funds for the relocation and relief of villagers in the riverbed should also be allocated as soon as possible. In particular, in the Weishan Lake area, all wheat crops have been destroyed by frost, and wheat crops on both banks of the Yellow River have largely suffered from jaundice and poor harvests. Without immediate relief to the disaster victims, the project cannot proceed smoothly.
    (2) The dikes downstream, stretching over a thousand *li*, have been largely destroyed and urgently need detailed surveying. In order to save time and proceed as scheduled, the Yellow River Commission should provide full technical assistance under the principle of 'unified planning.' Moreover, dredging the river, repairing dangerous sections, and straightening bends should be carried out earnestly and thoroughly, striving for long-term stability to conform to the spirit of 'preventing floods downstream.' Therefore, our delegation's reservation regarding the 'continued blocking of the breach' is extremely important. We hope that all relevant parties will pay full attention and handle this appropriately to ensure safety.
    (3) Given that prices in our region have recently been affected by external factors, the amount of grain and funds allocated in the first batch is actually limited. Furthermore, after eight years of enemy-caused disasters and three years of natural disasters, our region is extremely short of straw and requires a large amount of stone. The middle reaches still require mountain excavation, and a sea embankment needs to be built at the river mouth. Dredging the river, repairing dangerous sections, and straightening bends are extremely important and arduous projects. Taking just the repair of dangerous sections, the cost is not less than restoring the dikes. Therefore, regarding the funds, we hope that the wage standard for the Huayuankou breach blocking project will be used, implementing reimbursement based on actual expenses, which would be fair and reasonable.
    Finally, the spokesperson, on behalf of the 30 million people in our liberated area, expressed heartfelt gratitude to General Marshall, UNRRA representatives Mr. Franklin and Mr. Tadd, and other international friends and fair-minded individuals for their friendly assistance, and hoped that they would continue to give consideration and assistance to the above points to facilitate early implementation."

    边府发言人发表谈话
    希望尽早实现南京协议
    有关方面应迅速运到工粮工款，拨发河床居民救济经费及予技术上充分协助。
    【本报邯郸一日电】晋冀鲁豫边区政府发言人顷就南京协定，对本社记者发表谈话如次：
    发言人首称：先行浚河复堤，迁移救济，然后堵口放水，是我们一贯的主张和要求，曾先后表现在荷泽与开封协定中，因为只有这样，下游才不致成灾，这种精神，也包含在这次南京协定中充分的尊重和全力执行，也希望别人能够这样，因此，特提出下列几点注意：
    （一）根据历史的经验，为了使工程能够顺利进行，我们希望工粮工款及各种器材必须迅速运到，真正作到“不得受任何政治军事方面的阻碍”，对于迁移救济河床内村庄居民之经费，亦应尽早核发，特别是微山湖区，麦子全部霜死，黄河两岸麦子又大部黄疸歉收，灾民不即救济，就无法顺利进行工程。
    （二）下游一千余里之堤坝，早已大部毁坏，亟需详加勘测，为了争取时间，如期进行，黄委会应在“统一筹划”之原则下给予技术上之充分协助，而且对于浚河修险，截湾取直等工程，尤应认真彻底进行，应尽可能从长治久安着眼，以符合“以不使下游发生水灾为原则”之精神，故我代表团对“堵口工程继续进行”一点提出保留意见极为重要，至盼有关各方予以充分注意和适当处理，以策安全。
    （三）以我区物价近受外面影响，所允拨给之第一批工粮工款为数实属有限，且我区经八年敌灾三年天灾之后，秸料极感缺乏，需用石头甚多，中游尚需开山，河口亦须修入海坝，而浚河修险，截湾取直等工程又极为重要艰巨，单以修理险工一项而论，其费用即不较复堤为少，以此，关于工款，我们希望以花园口堵口工程工资为准，实行实报实销，方为公平合理。
    最后，发言人代表我解放区三千万人民，对于马歇尔将军，联总代表福兰克纳暨塔德先生等国际友人及各方公正人士之友好协助表示衷心之感谢，并盼对于上述各点，继续赐予考虑及协助，俾早实现。
