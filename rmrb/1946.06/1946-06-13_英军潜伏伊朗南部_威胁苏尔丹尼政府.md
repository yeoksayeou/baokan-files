Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 9th: A Tehran dispatch reports that Iranian newspapers have revealed that Iranian reactionaries, with foreign support, are engaging in activities against the Sultani government. Furthermore, foreign troops are stationed in southern Iran, threatening the Iranian government. The Iranian newspaper *Leader* stated that *Said Kotatan* newspaper, the organ of the former reactionary Prime Minister Said, recently convened a meeting of the chief editors of right-wing newspapers. A Reuters reporter attended the meeting, and a telegram to the Security Council was drafted and sent by Reuters. The telegram falsely accused the Sultani government, which is unanimously supported by the Iranian people, of being a government "lacking democracy and freedom." Iranian sources point out that the telegram is a signal for the reactionaries to openly oppose Sultani. According to *La Bar*, British officers disguised themselves and lurked in southern Iran. At the same time, British troops have not withdrawn from several islands, such as Bushehr and Baoule Su Island, which constitutes a threat to Iran. The newspaper suggested that the government organize an investigation team to conduct investigations in the aforementioned areas.
