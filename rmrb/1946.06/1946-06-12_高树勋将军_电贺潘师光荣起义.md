    General Gao Shuxun
    Telegraphically Congratulates Commander Pan's Glorious Uprising
    [From our newspaper in Handan, 10th] General Gao Shuxun, Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic National Construction Army here, recently sent a telegram to General Pan Shuoduan, congratulating the 184th Division on its glorious uprising. The original telegram is as follows:
    "To Commander Pan and all officers and soldiers of the 184th Division: Having read your public telegram, I am delighted to learn that you have refused to accept the order to create chaos, withdrawn from the civil war, and called for democracy and peace, diminishing the ferocity of the warmongers. Your righteous voice resonates and shakes the world! Saving the Northeast is saving China. Is there any person with conscience and love for peace who is unwilling to support you? If those who insist on dictatorship remain obsessed and continue to poison the Northeast, then resolutely withdrawing from the civil war vortex will surely be followed by others rising like you. Shuxun loves peace and dares not fall behind. The Handan Uprising last winter aimed to save the country and its people. Now, hearing of your righteous act, I feel even more that those who share the same ideals are of great help. From now on, I would like to maintain close contact to fight together. I send this telegram to express my respect and congratulations, hoping for your understanding. Gao Shuxun, Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic National Construction Army, respectfully sends this with his official seal."
