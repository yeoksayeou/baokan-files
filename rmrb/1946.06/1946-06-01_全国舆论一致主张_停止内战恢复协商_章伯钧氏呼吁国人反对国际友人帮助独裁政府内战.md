Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Moscow Radio commentator Masinu, commenting on Chinese public opinion today, pointed out that the Chinese civil war is continuing to expand and demanded an immediate cessation of the civil war and the resolution of all issues through political consultation. The Shanghai United Daily's Beijing correspondent reported details of the government army's Beijing meeting, stating that Bai Chongxi declared to the officers: They should continue fighting to the last man, and encouraged Kuomintang members to launch an anti-communist movement to arouse anti-communist sentiment among the people. Paris Radio broadcast the opinions of Shenyang political figures, saying: Although the government army has entered Changchun, the Communist Party's strength remains. Therefore, the only way to guarantee peace is through negotiation. The Associated Press reported Sun Ke's statement, saying, "It is impossible to eliminate the Communist Party." Chinese newspapers all pointed out that the civil war is hopeless, and its continuation has a great impact on residents and the economy. Wenhui Bao stated: The month-long battle of Siping Street is the cause of soaring prices and the intensification of the financial crisis; the country has reached the point of bankruptcy, and tens of millions of people are in despair. Shishi Xinbao also pointed out: Continuing the civil war will lead to complete economic and financial bankruptcy. Many Chinese newspapers, even the China Newspaper, which is similar to a Kuomintang mouthpiece, are calling for an immediate cessation of the civil war. Ta Kung Pao said: "We oppose resolving problems by force; this method will never achieve a solution." Shishi Daily wrote: If the civil war in the Northeast continues, internal peace in China is impossible.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Chongqing Democratic Weekly, issue 29, published an article by Zhang Bojun, leader of the Third Party, entitled "Efforts to Save the Crisis," pointing out that the current civil war, political, economic, and other crises are all caused by the Kuomintang authorities' "stubborn adherence to one-party dictatorship." Regarding the civil war crisis, he said: "Due to the Northeast Nine Provinces issue, the ruling Kuomintang refuses to adopt the demands of domestic and foreign figures for a political solution, and insists on forcibly taking over, so military conflicts have not only already occurred, but are also expanding," and "may affect other regions." Zhang strongly stated: "For the sake of China's peace and democracy, and the world's peace and security, the Chinese people and all democratic parties resolutely oppose any international friends providing any form of assistance to the personal military dictatorship of the one-party dictatorship government in China." Zhang concluded: It is necessary to "end the military conflict in the Northeast, realize democratic reforms, and guarantee the people's freedom and rights, and then completely reorganize the government—from the National Government and the Executive Yuan all the way down to the local governments. Only at this time can the National Assembly be convened to pass a democratic charter based on the principles for constitutional draft amendments agreed upon by all parties. And only at this time can the economic crisis begin to be addressed, and the plan for the nationalization and reorganization of the army can be truly implemented."

    全国舆论一致主张
    停止内战恢复协商
    章伯钧氏呼吁国人反对国际友人帮助独裁政府内战
    【新华社延安二十九日电】莫斯科今日广播评论员马西努论中国舆论一致指出中国内战在继续扩大，并要求立即停止内战，用政治协商方法解决一切问题。上海联合日报北平记者传出政府军北平会议详情，据称白崇禧向军官们声明：应继续战斗至一兵一卒，并鼓励国民党员开展反共运动，以引起民众反共情绪。巴黎无线电台广播沈阳政界要人的意见说：政府军虽然进入长春，但共产党的力量仍然保留着。因此保证和平的唯一方法是谈判。美联社传出孙科的声明，他说：“要消灭共产党是不可能的”。中国报纸都指出内战毫无前途，继续内战，对居民及经济有很大影响。文汇报称：四平街一个月的战斗，是物价飞涨，财政危机激化的原因，国家已到破产地步，成千万人民陷于绝望。时事新报亦指出：继续内战，会使经济与财政完全破产。中国许多报纸，甚至连近似国民党机关报的中国报纸，都要求立即停止内战。大公报称：“我们反对用武力解决问题，用这种方法是永远得不到解决的”。时事日报写道：东北内战再继续下去，中国内部的和平是不可能的。
    【新华社延安二十九日电】重庆民主星期刊，第二十九期载第三党领袖章伯钧氏“挽救危机的努力”一文，指出目前内战、政治、经济等各种危机，全系国民党当局“固执一党专政”所造成。谈及内战危机时称：“由于东北九省问题，执政的国民党不肯采纳国内外人士政治解决的要求，硬要武力接收，于是军事冲突不仅早已发生，而且正在扩大着”，并“可能影响到其他地区”。章氏力称：“为了中国的和平民主，和世界的和平安全，中国人民和各民主党派，坚决反对任何国际友人予中国一党专政的个人军事独裁的政府以任何方式的援助”。章氏结论称：必须“平息东北军事冲突，实现民主改革，保障人民自由权利，然后全盘改组政府——从国民政府和行政院一直到地方政府。只有这个时候，才能召开国民大会，通过已由各方协议的宪草修改原则为根据的民主宪章。也只有这个时候，经济危机才能开始着手解决，军队国家化的整编统编方案，才能真正付诸实施。
