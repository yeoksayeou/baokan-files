Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 6th: Soviet newspapers and radio have recently begun to express their opinions on the situation in Palestine following the release of the Anglo-American Palestine Investigation Committee report. Their arguments can be summarized as follows: (1) The situation in Palestine is extremely tense, threatening peace and security in the Near East; (2) This problem must be fundamentally resolved, but it should not be handled solely by the United States and Britain, but jointly by all United Nations members and the Palestinian people; (3) The Anglo-American Palestine Investigation Committee is an illegitimate body that violates the United Nations Charter. The committee is a private organization of the British and American governments; (4) The British and American governments should be responsible for the Palestinian problem, as the committee's recommendations violate the interests of both the Arab and Jewish peoples of Palestine; (5) The recommendations of the Anglo-American Committee are the product of Anglo-American contradictions. Britain is attempting to use the committee to shift responsibility to the United States. In this regard, Izvestia observer Mayev pointed out that Britain is striving to maintain its position in the Middle East, especially its strategic position. Therefore, it painstakingly created an "independent" Transjordan, making it an important British base in the Middle East. Similarly, it is also trying hard to maintain its base in Palestine because by controlling Palestine and Transjordan, it can ensure the safety of the Suez Canal (even if British troops withdraw from Egypt) and threaten the growing national movements in Arab countries such as Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq.

However, the United States' activities in the Middle East are increasingly worrying Britain. The United States has consolidated its position in some Arab countries, especially Saudi Arabia and Lebanon, and is currently negotiating with Egypt. In order to further penetrate Arab countries economically and politically, the United States is paying special attention to Palestine, which has intensified Anglo-American contradictions. Britain is extremely unwilling for Jewish people supported by the United States to immigrate to Palestine. To this end, it has taken many measures to restrict Jewish immigration, but it is unwilling to offend the United States, affecting American loans to Britain and other assistance. Therefore, it is using Arabs to confront the United States. Britain claims on the one hand that it supports the Arabs, but on the other hand, it says that due to American pressure, it has to agree to the American approach. From this, it can be seen that the sensational Palestinian events are originally the result of Anglo-American conflicts of interest. Soviet commentary quoted many Arab newspaper opinions, proving that Arab countries are fully aware of the Anglo-American drama. Izvestia pointed out that the national movement in Arab countries is on the rise, especially the struggle in Egypt demanding the withdrawal of British troops and the struggle in Iraq demanding the revision of the Anglo-Iraqi treaty are in full swing (according to the Anglo-Iraqi treaty, Britain controls Iraq's economic lifeline, especially the oil industry, and stations troops in Iraq). But it also pointed out that there is no shortage of national traitors in Arab countries, such as Assam, chairman of the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee, whose activities are contrary to the Arab people's demands for independence. What he hopes for is to maintain foreign rule in Arab countries.

    巴勒斯坦形势忽告紧张
    英美利益冲突威胁近东和平
    苏报主张应由联合国作根本解决
    【新华社延安六日电】苏联报纸与广播，最近对英美巴勒斯坦调查委员会报告发表后的巴勒斯坦形势，开始表示意见，综合其论点如下：（一）巴勒斯坦形势，已异常紧张，以致威胁着近东的和平与安全；（二）这个问题当然要作根本解决，但不应只由美英两国处理，而应由全体联合国及巴勒斯坦人民共同处理；（三）英美巴勒斯坦调查委员会是不合法的机关，它是违背联合、宪章的，这委员会是英美政府的私人机关；（四）巴勒斯坦的问题，应由英美两国政府负责，因英美委员会的建议，违背了巴勒斯坦回犹两族人民的利益；（五）英美委员会的建议，是英美矛盾的产品，英国企图经过该委员会，把责任推给美国，对此，消息报观察家梅叶夫指出：英国力图保持它在中东的地位，尤其是它的战略地位，因此它苦心制造了一个外约旦的“独立”，使外约旦成为英国在中东的重要基地。同等，它亦极力欲保持其在巴勒斯坦的基地，因掌握了巴勒斯坦与外约旦，一可使苏伊士运河无虞（即使英军自埃及撤退），二可威胁叙利亚、黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯、及伊拉克等阿拉伯国家日益滋长的民族运动。但是美国在中东的活动，日益使英国感到忧虑。美国已巩固其在一部分阿拉伯国家，尤其是在沙特阿拉伯与黎巴嫩的地位，最近并正与埃及进行谈判。美国为了进一步在经济与政治方面渗入阿拉伯各国，因此对巴勒斯坦特别注意，这就使英美在巴勒斯坦的矛盾激烈化起来。英国极不愿美国所支持的犹太人移入巴勒斯坦，为此，她曾有许多限制犹太人入境的措施，但她又不愿得罪美国，影响美国对英贷款及其地方面的帮助，因而她就利用阿拉伯人来对抗美国。英国一方面扬言她是支持阿拉伯人的，但同时又说由于美国的压力，不得不同意美国的办法。由此可见，闹得轰轰烈烈的巴勒斯坦事件，原是英美利益冲突的结果。苏联评论引证许多阿拉伯报纸的言论，证明阿拉伯各国对英美的戏剧已充分洞悉。消息报指出：阿拉伯国家民族运动，正在向上高涨，尤其是埃及要求英军撤退，伊拉克要求重修英伊条约的斗争，正在尖锐进行中（按根据英伊条约，英国控制了伊拉克经济命脉，特别是石油工业部门，并驻军伊境）。但同时也指出，在阿拉伯国家中，仍不缺民族败类，如巴勒斯坦阿拉伯高级委员会主席阿桑姆，他的活动与阿拉伯人民独立要求相违背，他希望的是维持外国在阿拉伯各国的统治。
