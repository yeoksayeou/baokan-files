　　Another Strong Force Added to the Ranks of the Masses' Emancipation
　　Military and Political University Students to Be Dispatched to the Countryside

　　[Changzhi News from This Newspaper] Students of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military and Political University have completed two months of political rectification. The entire contingent is now studying policies and laws such as rent reduction and interest rate reduction, as well as the concrete experiences of mobilizing the masses in various places, preparing to be dispatched to the countryside after June to participate in the work of mobilizing the masses in various places, and to learn from the broad masses, and to temper themselves in practice. When the school authorities issued the call to go to the masses, it immediately received an enthusiastic response from all the students in the school, and the enthusiasm for studying politics and mass movement experience was extremely high. Each team has proposed competitions to ensure the victorious completion of this task and to resolutely not ask for leave to go home halfway. Most of the students in this term are students from newly liberated areas and intellectuals from Sichuan, Shaanxi and other places. After political rectification, they have extremely high enthusiasm for serving the masses. This time, going to the countryside is indeed adding a new main force to the mass movement in this area.
