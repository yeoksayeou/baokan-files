　　【Our Newspaper】 Since the direct units of the Jin-Lu-Yu Military Region launched the work of helping the masses with the wheat harvest on the 1st of this month, they have achieved great results. A total of twenty-eight units enthusiastically participated. In fourteen or fifteen villages near Handan City, troops helping with the wheat harvest are scattered everywhere under the scorching sun. Up to the present day, the direct units of the military region have helped with 564 workdays, reaping 545 mu of wheat; the guard regiment has helped with 655 workdays, reaping 821 mu of wheat; the direct units of the communications bureau have helped with 1,225 workdays, reaping 1,139 mu of wheat, totaling 2,444 workdays and reaping 2,505 mu of wheat. If each worker's wage is calculated at 500 yuan per day, then the masses have been saved 1,222,000 yuan. During the harvest, the comrades were extremely enthusiastic, going out early and returning late, not eating anything from the masses. The squad leader of the 7th Squad of the 5th Company of the Guard Regiment, not only harvested the wheat while ill but also explained to the comrades: "Helping the masses is helping ourselves." Some comrades in the military region's communications unit cut their hands and got blisters on their hands but were unwilling to leave the wheat field. The masses in each village were extremely moved. Old Mr. Wang Derun said: "Comrades, I have lived for over fifty years, and this is the first time I have seen such a good troop. They don't eat, they don't smoke, and some have blisters on their hands, but they still harvest vigorously!"
    【Xingtai News】 All the teachers and students of Northern University helped the masses with the summer harvest, reaping a total of 894 mu of wheat in eight days. A total of 392 teachers and students participated. While reaping the wheat, they also learned from the people and studied why the wheat had jaundice and studied how to make learning and practice more closely integrated.
