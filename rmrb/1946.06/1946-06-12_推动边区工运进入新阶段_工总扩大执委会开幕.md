    Pushing the Border Region's Labor Movement into a New Stage
    General Labor Union Enlarged Executive Committee Opens
    Deputy Political Commissar Bo pointed out that the labor movement's guiding principle is labor-capital cooperation, labor-capital mutual assistance, and mutual benefit for labor and capital; to ensure sufficient raw materials, low costs, high output, good quality, and broad sales channels.

    [This newspaper reported] The second enlarged executive committee meeting of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Federation of Trade Unions was officially held on the 8th at the No. 2 Elementary School in Handan City. Sixty-two representatives attended, including those from the Taihang, Taiyue, Ji-Lu-Yu, and Ji'nan administrative regions, representing 400,000 workers in 197 counties of the border region, including industry, railways, transportation, postal services, telecommunications, river transport, kiln workers, hired laborers, and sheep workers. The meeting discussed how to implement the current labor movement policy of uniting and educating workers to practice labor-capital cooperation, develop production, and engage in the industrial construction of the liberated areas. It also addressed issues such as revising the trade union work program, determining work plans and methods, and electing the next standing committee. This conference was the first meeting after the four administrative regions under the border region were united. The participating representatives listened attentively to the report of Deputy Political Commissar Bo with tense and excited feelings. After summarizing the past labor movement, he pointed out that the future labor movement's guiding principle is "labor-capital cooperation, labor-capital mutual assistance, and mutual benefit for labor and capital." To construct and develop the industry of the liberated areas, it is necessary to ensure sufficient raw materials, low costs, high output, good quality, and broad sales channels in production and construction to have a future for survival and development. The specific method for implementing the labor movement policy is for labor and capital to formulate common plans and goals, complete them on a regular basis, and work together to promote the economic prosperity of the liberated areas. This method will first be implemented in public enterprises and then popularized to general private enterprises. Deputy Speaker Xing also spoke on the spot, calling on workers to implement labor-capital cooperation on the existing industrial base in the liberated areas and push the industrial construction of the liberated areas forward. Worker Senator Yuan Zhihe (currently the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Border Region Government) called on the workers of the border region to fully develop their initiative and exemplary role and dedicate themselves to the revolutionary cause. The level of wages should be determined based on the overall needs of the revolution. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the unity of new and old workers to consolidate their ranks. Secondly, technical workers and technicians should be respected, and efforts should be made to learn from them. Thirdly, workers should have the idea of accumulating capital and actively working hard for the industrial construction of the liberated areas, so labor-capital cooperation should be strengthened to strive for production and avoid waste. Comrade Ji Yonggui, a worker leader, said: Trade union comrades should discuss production well with the factory and strengthen worker education, so that the factory can be profitable and the workers' lives can be improved, and labor-capital cooperation can be consolidated. This is the real mass perspective. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM.

     The conference sends a nationwide telegram protesting US aid to Chiang for expanding the civil war.

    [Also reported] The second enlarged executive committee meeting of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Federation of Trade Unions sent a nationwide telegram opposing the civil war. The telegram stated: The Kuomintang reactionaries, relying on the assistance of the American reactionaries, are attacking the liberated areas everywhere, expanding the civil war, and slaughtering the vast masses of the people. We firmly oppose this sinful behavior. We demand that the workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas hold just protests and heroic struggles against the reactionaries. The workers in our liberated areas must work hard with the capitalists, fully develop their initiative in all production sectors, and fight to defend the peace and democracy of the Chinese people.
