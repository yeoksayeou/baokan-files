    【Ben Bao Yangcheng 3rd disptach】After suffering setbacks in their offensive against our Gu Shan area in Southern Shanxi last month, the Jiang-Yan troops continued to amass forces and redeploy. In addition to preparing to attack our Gu Shan garrison again, they are also preparing to invade our Jiwang Mountain area. On May 23, Ai Ziqian led the 215th Regiment of his division and assembled at Dongxi Jingcun (25 li southeast of Wanquan). The 214th Regiment assembled at Lujiazhuang (15 li south of Jingcun). The headquarters of the 39th Division also moved into Zhaidian Town (35 li southwest of Jishan) on the 24th. More than 1,000 men of the 2nd Regiment of the division moved into Qizhuang, 15 li northeast of Wanquan. After the above-mentioned Jiang-Yan troops formed a tight encirclement around our liberated area in Southern Shanxi, they further adopted a "nibbling" and "mopping-up" policy of gradual advance to launch an offensive against us. On the 28th, more than 600 men of the 39th Division, assembled at strongholds such as Sanlin Town, Wangcun, Zhouliu Town, and Babi (all in the southwest and west of Xinjiang), attacked our garrisons in Wan'an and Tiandimiao (30 li southwest of Xinjiang) again. After the Yan troops occupied these two areas, they actively built fortifications. On the same day, the Wanquan "Love the Homeland Corps" also took the opportunity to occupy Fayun Temple in our Gu Shan area. On the 29th, Shao Zeqing's unit of the Yan 215th Regiment occupied Zhangjiapo and Handi (25 li east of Wanquan) and are now attacking our Niangniangmiao garrison. According to documents seized from the Yan troops, Yan Xishan plans to transfer the 69th Division from Linfen to Southern Shanxi to continue expanding the civil war in Southern Shanxi.
    【Ben Bao Yangcheng 3rd urgent dispatch】Yan troops in Quwo, Wenxi and other places have launched large-scale disturbances against us in recent days to coordinate with their offensive in Southern Shanxi, and have been repelled by our self-defense. It is clear that the Yan troops are creating conflict and provoking civil war. From May 26 to May 29, airplanes continuously flew to Quwo, Jiangxian, Wenxi and other places to deliver ammunition for the Yan troops, as preparation for new offensives. The 5th and 9th regiments of the Security Corps, totaling more than 1,500 men stationed in Quwo City, attacked the Eighth Route Army stationed in Anji Village (3 li south of the city) at dawn on May 31. Our army tried to dissuade them without success and were forced to defend themselves. After fierce fighting until 9:00 a.m., the attacking Yan troops were repelled. At 7:00 a.m. on June 1, more than 200 men attacked our Mazhuang (7 li east of the city), but were also repelled. Yan troops in Wenxi also launched attacks for days starting May 29, plundering wheat on a large scale. On May 30, more than 300 Yan troops attacked our positions south of the city, but were repelled. At 9:00 a.m. on June 1, more than 300 Yan troops attacked our garrison at Zhuang'er, while another group of more than 100 men attacked our Wenxi Station, both of which were repelled. We have lodged a serious protest with the Linfen Executive Group against the above-mentioned continuous violations of the agreement and attacks against us by the Yan troops. The Yan troops shall be fully responsible for any adverse consequences caused by such behavior.

    汾南蒋阎军集结
    进犯我稷王山区
    临汾执行组我代表提出抗议
    【本报阳城三日电】蒋阎军上月中旬向我汾南孤山地区进攻遭受挫折后，又继续集结兵力，重新部署，除准备对我孤山驻军再度进攻外，并准备向我稷王山区进犯。五月二十三日，艾子谦率该师二一五团，集结于东西景村（万泉东南二十五里），二一四团集结于路家庄（景村南十五里），三十九师师部亦于二十四日由稷山进驻翟店镇（稷山西南三十五里），该师第二团千余人则进驻万泉东北十五里之七庄；蒋军三十一师除留一个团仍驻临晋外，大部东开万泉及荣河以东地区。以上蒋阎军对我汾南解放区形成严密包围形势后，即进一步采取逐步推进的“蚕食”、“清剿”政策，向我展开进攻。二十八日，集结于三林镇、王村、周流镇、柏壁（均在新绛西南和以西地区）等据点之三十九师六百余人，再度向我万安、天地庙（新绛西南三十里）驻军进攻，阎军侵占该两地区后，即积极修筑工事，同日万泉“爱乡团”亦乘机侵占我孤山发云寺。二十九日阎二一五团邵哲清部，侵占我张家坡、汉地（万泉东二十五里）后，正向我娘娘庙驻军进攻中。据我从缴获阎军之文件中获悉，阎锡山拟自临汾抽调六十九师赴汾南继续扩大汾南内战。
    【本报阳城三日急电】曲沃、闻喜等地阎军为配合其汾南进攻，连日向我大举扰犯，经我自卫将其击退。阎军显系制造冲突，挑动内战。五月廿六日至二十九日连续有飞机至曲沃、绛县、闻喜等地为阎军投送弹药，作为新进攻准备。驻曲沃城内之保安五团第九团共一千五百余人，于五月三十一日拂晓，向驻安吉村（城南三里）之八路军进攻，我军劝阻无效，被迫自卫，激战至上午九时，始将进犯之阎军击退。六月一日七时，二百余人又向我马庄（城东七里）进犯，亦被击退。闻喜阎军亦于五月二十九日起连日出犯，大肆抢麦，于五月三十日阎军三百余人向我城南阵地进犯，被我击退，六月一日上午九时，阎军三百余人，复向庄儿我守军进攻，同时另一路百余人进攻我闻喜车站，均被击退。以上阎军不断违约向我进攻，我已向临汾执行组提出严重抗议，由此种行为造成之不良后果，均应由阎军负其全责。
