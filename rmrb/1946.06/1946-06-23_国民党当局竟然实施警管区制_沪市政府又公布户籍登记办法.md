Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 18th: According to the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao and Wen Hui Bao at the beginning of this month, despite opposition from all sectors to the "Police Officer Police District System," it began implementation as scheduled on June 1st. Wu Guozhen had released a smokescreen in late May, saying that although the police district system was decided to be implemented, it would not involve "interrogation," but "only" patrol. At the same time, Shanghai Police Chief Xuan Tie Wu also claimed he would go to Nanjing to "resign" because "administrative measures have been obstructed." However, after Xuan Tie Wu returned to Shanghai at the end of May, not only did he not "abandon his intention to resign," but he was also promoted to "Commander-in-Chief of the Songhu Garrison Command" and concurrently the Chief of the Municipal Police Bureau, holding full power to implement police control, and told Wen Hui Bao reporters: "I will no longer pay attention to or explain the various criticisms and opposition from the outside world, and will not waste any more words." "Police officers can still conduct interrogations when necessary in the course of their duties." The 367 police officers currently undertaking "police district" tasks are mostly graduates of the first class of the junior class of the Central Police Academy. At the same time, the Civil Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Government also announced "Household Registration Measures," "detailing various registration items" and "methods for conducting roving spot checks," stipulating that the household registration chief (甲长) must review each household once a day, the 保长 (bao chief) must spot check five 甲 (jia) each month, the staff of the 保 (bao) office must spot check ten 甲 (jia) each month, and the assistant officers of the district office responsible for inspection must spot check five 保 (bao) each month, and the head of the household administration section must spot check two 保 (bao) each month.

　　国民党当局竟然实施警管区制
    沪市政府又公布户籍登记办法
    【新华社延安十八日电】据本月初之沪大公报及文汇报消息：各界人士同声反对“警员警管区制”，按期于六月一日开始实施。吴国桢曾于五月未放出烟幕说，警管区虽决定实行，并不访问，“只是”巡逻巡逻。同时，沪市警察局长宣铁吾亦以“行政措施已遭阻碍”，而声称晋京“请辞”，但在五月底宣铁吾返沪后，不惟未“打消辞意”，而且被擢升为“淞沪警备司令部总司令”兼市警察局长，掌握全权实行警管制，并对文汇报记者说：“外界种种非难反对，以后决不理会，亦不再予以解释，多费唇舌”。“警员在职务上必要时，仍可访问”。现担任“警管”任务的警士三百六十七名，大部均系中央警官学校初级班第一期毕业生。与此同时，上海市府民政处又公布了“户籍登记办法”，“详细规定登记各种项目”及“巡回抽查办法”，规定户籍主任甲长，每日须按户复查一次，保长每月须抽查五甲，保办公处干事每月须抽查十甲，区公所负责视察之助理员，每月须抽查伍保，户政股主任每月须抽查二保。
