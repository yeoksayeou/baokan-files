Resolutely Beat Back the Attacking Stubborn and Puppet Forces
Jiyuan Militia Grows Stronger in Battle
With the full support of the broad masses of liberated peasants, the joint defense militia in the Liuzhuang and Maoling areas fought 120 battles against the stubborn and puppet forces in five months.
Whoever tries to prevent us from standing up, we will fight them to the end!
[This Newspaper's Report] Since the Kuomintang's 90th Army and the puppet army of Wei Ansheng and others violated the ceasefire agreement on January 14th this year, crossed the Yellow River, and occupied Potou Town in Jiyuan County, our joint defense militia in the Mazhu, Liuzhuang, and Maoling areas west of the town, with the full support of the broad masses of liberated peasants, have carried out more than five months of unyielding self-defense struggles. They have fought 120 battles against the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops and still hold their original positions in the hilly area of about 40 li from west of Potou to Dayu on the border of Wangwu Mountain, remaining unyielding and growing stronger in battle, with increasingly firm confidence. Due to the heroic battles of the joint defense militia, the mass anti-traitor, revenge, grievance-airing, and liquidation movement, which was reaching its climax when the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops invaded, was not only not interrupted but continued to surge, developing from base villages to general villages, and even to Mazhu, which is only three li away from the enemy. In the past two months, the movement has deepened from anti-traitors and anti-local tyrants to rent reduction and debt liquidation. During the wheat harvest, their slogan was that not a single grain of wheat should be seized by the stubborn and puppet forces. Villages behind the front line formed labor teams of seventy or eighty people to help the villages on the front line rush to harvest. The militia closely monitored the actions of the stubborn and puppet forces, and the entire harvest was completed in seven days. In five months, the westward activity of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops did not exceed four li, and they were unable to enter even Liuzhuang (only six li from Potou). In five months, these joint defense militia demonstrated a high degree of bravery and creativity. As early as January 20th, two days after our army re-liberated Meng County from the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops (on the 18th), the Liuzhuang and other village militia immediately launched a heroic counterattack against the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in Potou, rushing into the stubborn and puppet strongholds. Their slogan was to drive the stubborn and puppet forces back to their original defense areas. After this, they constantly harassed, but each time they were blocked, intercepted, and outflanked by the militia, unable to advance. The militia often buried landmines by the village of Potou and on the streets and left. After several explosions, the stubborn and puppet forces in Potou became extremely alarmed and had to retreat to the east of the town, rarely leaving their gates. Later, although they tried to remove the landmines (they did remove a few), and sent plainclothes agents to ambush our militia who were burying landmines, they were beaten several times. The morale of our militia and the masses became even higher. Under the call of the district headquarters, the masses in each village made a stone mine. The stubborn and puppet forces became even more frustrated when they heard this. Sometimes when they came out, they only circled around the edge of the village before shrinking back. When the Executive Group came, the stubborn and puppet forces went crazy for a while, harassing every day. After the militia and the masses sent representatives to petition (asking them to return to their original defense areas), which was unreasonably rejected by the Kuomintang, they began to be forced to intensify their self-defense struggle, fighting against the attacking stubborn and puppet forces. In mid-March, dozens of militia members raided Potou again, destroyed the puppet cooperative (an organ for exploiting the masses), and seized a box of bullets and other materials. Afterwards, they continued to lay mines near the stronghold, again causing panic among the stubborn and puppet forces in Potou. On a six- or seven-li-long section along the four sides of the stronghold, the militia planted 30,000 jin of gègezhēn (thorny bushes), with landmines hanging on them, forming a strict blockade, making it almost impossible for the stubborn and puppet forces to loot grain and firewood. Their contact with the Kuomintang secret agents and traitors in the liberated areas also encountered great difficulties. Therefore, there were no rumors of "changing the sky" among the masses in this area, only strong hatred. The stubborn and puppet forces said: "Those who are caught from the Eighth Independent Joint Defense (this area was originally called the Eighth Independent Joint Defense) will be killed. Even the chickens of the Eighth Independent Joint Defense will not be left with three feathers." The masses said: "We fought the Japanese for seven or eight years, are we afraid to fight you? Whoever doesn't let us stand up, we'll fight them to the end!" The masses and militia in each village have formulated joint defense pacts, vowing not to compromise with the stubborn and puppet forces, not to provide them with information, not to give them a grain of rice, or a penny. In March, the stubborn and puppet forces, with more than 100 people, surrounded more than 30 militia members from Liandi and Liuzhuang in the east of Liuzhuang village, resulting in a fierce battle. Although our militia repelled the stubborn and puppet forces, killing three and wounding several, two of our militia members also sacrificed their lives. When the dead were carried back to Liandi, all the militia and the entire village wept, but they were not pessimistic or fearful because of this, but resolutely demanded to go and fight. Only after repeated dissuasion from the leadership did they stop going. In order to carry out the struggle more effectively, the masses constantly donated bullets to the militia. The masses in Liuye Village used the fruits of the struggle to buy bullets for the militia. They said: "As long as we can stop the invasion of the traitors and the Kuomintang army, we will have everything!" In fact, they have great trust in the militia. Once, Liuzhuang performed a play about standing up (the masses in this area often write and perform their own plays). The stubborn and puppet forces had a big fight with the militia two li east of the village, but the play in the village did not stop. The masses all said: "It doesn't matter! The militia is in front!" Now, some of the masses have adapted the militia's self-defense achievements and tactics against the stubborn and puppet forces into plays to express their infinite love for the militia and their firm confidence and determination in the self-defense struggle.

　　把进攻的顽伪坚决打回去
    济源民兵愈战愈强
    广大翻身农民全力支援，留庄、毛岭一带联防民兵五个月与顽伪作战百二十次。
    谁不叫咱翻身，咱就和他拚到底！
    【本报讯】自国民党九十军与伪军卫安生等部于今年一月十四日违反停战协议，渡过黄河，占领我济源县坡头镇以来，该镇以西马驻、留庄、毛岭一带的联防民兵，在广大翻身农民的全力支援下，进行了五个多月不屈不挠的自卫斗争，与蒋伪军作战一百二十次，至今仍坚持着坡头以西直至王屋边境之大峪一线约四十里的邱陵地带原有阵地，圪然不动，而且愈战愈强，信心愈坚了。由于联防民兵的英勇战斗，使蒋伪军侵入时正走上高潮的群众反奸复仇诉苦清算运动不仅没有中断，而且继续高涨，从基点村普遍发展到一般村，以至发展到离敌三里的马驻。最近两月，运动已由反汉奸、反恶霸深入到减租清债。麦收时，他们的口号是不叫顽伪抢走一粒麦，后面村庄组成七八十人的扎工队，去帮助前沿村庄抢收，民兵严密监视着顽伪行动，七天就全部突击完了。五个月内，蒋伪军向西的活动没有超过四里路，连留庄（距坡头仅六里）都没有能进去。五个月内，这些联防民兵发挥了高度的勇敢与创造性。远在一月十八日我军从蒋伪军手里重新解放孟县之后二日（即二十日），留庄等村民兵就紧接着对坡头蒋伪军进行了一次英勇的反击，冲入顽伪据点，他们的口号是要把顽伪驱回他们原来的防地。这以后，不断出扰，但每次都遭到民兵的堵击、截击、抄后路，不能前进。民兵常常把地雷埋到坡头村边和街上就走了，一连几次爆炸，使坡头顽伪变成风声鹤唳，不得不退到镇东去驻，门也很少出了。以后他们虽然设法起地雷（曾起走几个），又派便衣伏击我埋雷民兵，结果好几次挨了打。我民兵与群众情绪更加高涨。在区指挥部号召下，各村群众每人都打一个石雷。顽伪听说后，更加沮丧了。有时出来，也只在村边绕绕，就又缩了回去。执行小组来时，顽伪曾疯狂一时，连日出扰。民兵与群众在派代表请愿（请他们退回原防），被国方无理拒绝之后，又开始被迫加紧自卫斗争，与进攻之顽伪作战。三月中，几十个民兵又袭入坡头，把伪合作社（压榨群众机关）捣毁了，并缴得子弹一箱与其他不少物资。以后继续向据点埋雷，又造成坡头顽伪的风声鹤唳。在沿据点四侧的六七里长地段上，民兵插起了三万斤圪针（荆棘），圪针上挂着地雷，形成了严密的封锁线，使顽伪抢掠粮食柴炭，几乎成为不可能。他们和解放区特务汉奸的联系，也遭到极大困难。所以，这一带群众中没有“变天”的谣言，只有强烈的仇恨。顽伪说：“捉到独八联（这一带原称独立第八联保）的人一齐杀绝，捉住独八联的鸡子也不留三根毛。”群众说：“我们跟日本打也打了七八年哩，跟你们还不敢打？谁不叫我们翻身，我们就跟他拚到底！”各村群众与民兵都自订联防公约，发誓不与顽伪妥协，不给顽伪通风报信，不给顽伪一粒粮，一文钱。三月份，顽伪曾以一百多人，把我莲底与留庄民兵三十多人包围在留庄村东，发生激战，我民兵虽将顽伪击退，并打死顽伪三人，打伤好几个，我民兵也牺牲了两个。当死者被抬回莲地时，全体民兵与全村群众都哭了一场，但他们没有为此悲观畏缩，而是一齐坚决要求前去拚命。经领导上一再劝阻，才停止前去。群众为着更有效的进行斗争，不断的自动捐给民兵子弹。柳叶村群众，是用斗争果实给民兵购买子弹的。他们说：“只要能挡住汉奸和国民党的军进攻，什么都有了！”事实上，他们对民兵也就是非常信赖的。有一次留庄演翻身戏（这一带群众经常自编自演），顽伪在村东二里与民兵大打起来，但村里的戏并不停唱。群众都说：“不要紧！民兵在前边哩！”现在，群众已经有的把民兵反顽伪的自卫战绩与战术编成戏演唱，表现他们对民兵的无限爱护与自卫斗争的坚强信心与决心。
