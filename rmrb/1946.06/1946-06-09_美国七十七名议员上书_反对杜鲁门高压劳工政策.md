    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 6th: Washington dispatch: A movement opposing President Truman's oppressive policies towards labor is gradually unfolding within the United States. According to dispatches from the Associated Press and others: After the Senate revised Truman's anti-labor bill and sent it back to the House, sixty congressmen sympathetic to labor immediately convened a special meeting on the 3rd to listen to the opposition from organized labor and called on all congressmen to attend the meeting. At the meeting, Washington State Democratic Congressman DeLacy declared, "The purpose of the meeting is to stop all this hysteria." The leaders of the four major trade unions, including CIO President Murray and AFL President Green, attended the meeting to report. In his speech, Murray denounced "this bill as an attempt to abolish the anti-slavery amendment in the Constitution," and he demanded the rejection of this slavery bill. After the meeting, seventy-seven congressmen sent a joint petition to Truman, urging the President to veto the Case Bill (i.e., the anti-strike bill) and promising to vote against any motion to override such a veto. United Press International stated, "Truman's handling of the emergency anti-strike bill has been met with many dissenting statements." Another dispatch: Disregarding Truman's order for the army to take over ships, American maritime workers decided to insist on holding a strike on the 15th if their reasonable demands for wage increases and reduced working hours were not met. To this end, Curran, president of the National Maritime Union, and Bridges, president of the Pacific Coast Longshoremen's Union, telegraphed Sainan, secretary-general of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Paris, on the 3rd, requesting him to invite member countries not to load or unload ships requisitioned by the US government once the strike began.

    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 6th: Moscow dispatch: Soviet newspapers and Moscow Radio have criticized Truman's anti-strike law and other regulations passed by Congress restricting labor. The reactionaries' infringement on the rights of the working people is part of a conspiracy to oppose world peace. They also stated, "The government has shown that it is siding with Wall Street," and the importance of the matter has gone beyond domestic politics. Organized workers are a bulwark against a new world war, and the most reactionary imperialist groups are preparing for this war. Many commentators have condemned the United States for beginning to openly violate and abandon the Potsdam and other Three-Power decisions. Soviet radio stated that the Anglo-American plan for organizing the post-war world is like a naughty elementary school student taking a calligraphy lesson, with the teacher writing on one side and the student copying silently on the other. The broadcast declared, "Under the banner of 'striving for peace,' an Anglo-American bloc is being formed."

    美国七十七名议员上书
    反对杜鲁门高压劳工政策
    苏报抨击反劳工法案已超出内政范围
    是最反动的帝国主义集团准备新战争            
    【新华社延安六日电】华盛顿讯：反对杜鲁门总统对劳工施行高压政策的运动，目前已在美国内逐渐展开。据美联社等讯：杜鲁门的反劳工法案，经参院修正送回众院后，有六十名同情劳工的议员，即于三日召集特别会议，听取有组织劳工的反对意见，并号召一切议员参加议会。会上，华盛顿州民主党众议员德拉西宣称：“会议之目的在于阻止所有这种歇斯的里症”。产业工会联合会主席摩莱、劳工联合会主席格尔林等四大职工会领导，均到会报告。摩莱在发言中，指斥“这一法案是企图废弃宪法中反奴役的修正案”，他要求否决这一奴役法案。会后七十七名议员向杜鲁门致送联名请求书，敦促总统否决凯斯法案（按即反罢工法案），并诺许投票反对任何蹂躏这种否决权的动议。合众社称：“杜鲁门处理反罢工之紧急法案，遭受到许多反对声明”。又讯：美海员工人不顾杜鲁门命令陆军接收船只之威胁，决定如果不能答应增资与减少工时的合理要求，则坚持于十五日举行罢工。全国海员职工会主席克尔伦及太平洋码头工人联合会主席布立治，为此于三日致电巴黎世界职工联盟总书记赛南，要求他邀请各会员国一旦罢工开始时，不为美政府所征发的船只装卸货物。
    【新华社延安六日电】莫斯科讯：苏联各报及莫斯科广播，抨击杜鲁门反罢工法，及国会其它限制劳工的条例。反动派之侵害劳动人民的权利，是谋反对世界和平诡计的一部分。并称：“政府已显示站到华尔街方面”，事情的重要性，已超出国内政治之外，有组织的工人反对新世界战争的堡垒；而最反动的帝国主义集团则正准备这个战争。许多评论员都谴责美国已开始公开违反与废弃波茨顿及其他三强决定。苏广播称：英美组织战后世界的计划，像不规矩的小学生上习字课的情形，一边是教员写，一边是学生默写。广播宣称：“在‘力求和平’的标语下，正在形成一个英美集团”。
