　　Kuomintang Destroys Nanjing Agreement
    Border Region Voices Indignation
    Vowing Support for the Demands of Compatriots Along the River
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Kuomintang authorities, failing to implement the Nanjing Agreement, are not only delaying the supply of funds for labor, grain for labor, and equipment and materials, and using armed forces to obstruct the dyke restoration project in the Liberated Areas, but are also ignoring the dyke restoration project in the Kuomintang areas above Changyuan, and are instead intensifying the plugging of the breach at Huayuankou. This treacherous behavior has aroused the indignation and protest of people from all walks of life and the broad masses of people in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, who have issued letters, telegrams, and statements, resolutely demanding that the Kuomintang authorities immediately and faithfully implement the Nanjing Agreement, promptly allocate funds for labor, grain for labor, and equipment and materials, guarantee that armed forces will not be sent to obstruct the dyke restoration in the future, promptly start the restoration of dykes above Changyuan, and immediately stop the Huayuankou plugging project. The Henan Democratic National Construction Association's declaration stated: "The ink of the Nanjing Agreement is not yet dry, and the Kuomintang authorities have already gone back on their word. The people of our Henan Province, who have suffered the tragic disaster of the 27-year diversion, will never bear to see the two thousand miles of compatriots along the river downstream suffer this man-made catastrophe again." The declaration also demanded that the Kuomintang authorities effectively provide relief to the disaster victims in the new flooded areas of Henan. The Taihang Administrative Office and the Taihang Office of the Border Council jointly declared: "The five million people in the Taihang area are filled with indignation upon hearing the news. Our Taihang is connected by flesh and blood with the people along the river in Hebei and Shandong provinces. Their pain is our pain, and helping those in distress is like helping ourselves. We vow to back up the demands of our compatriots along the river." The Taihang Area Cooperative Conference also held a special forum. The representatives all expressed their indignation. Yang Fani, a representative of the Piancheng Cooperative, said: "The people of the Border Region are one family. We will never let the reactionaries release water. We resolutely demand that the Kuomintang authorities abandon all conspiracies and implement the Nanjing Agreement."

    【本报特讯】国民党当局不执行南京协议，一面拖延工款、工粮及器材物资之供给，并以武装阻扰解放区复堤工程，一面对长垣以上国民党区之复堤工程置之不顾，反在花园口加紧进行堵口，此种背信弃义行为，已引起晋冀鲁豫边区各界人士及广大人民之愤恨抗议，纷纷发表函电及谈话，坚决要求国民党当局立即忠实执行南京协议，迅速拨发工款、工粮及器材物资，保证今后不再派武装阻扰复堤，从速动工修复长垣以上堤岸，立即停止花园口堵口工程。河南民主建国学会的宣言称：“南京协议之墨汁未干，国民党当局竟又自食其言，我豫省人民，身受二十七年改道之惨祸，决不忍又见下游二千里沿河同胞再罹此人为之浩劫”。该宣言并要求国民党当局切实救济河南新泛区灾胞。太行行署及边参会太行办事处联合宣言则称：“太行区五百万人民闻讯之余，不胜愤慨，我太行与冀鲁两省沿河人民血肉相关，彼痛即我痛，人溺犹自溺，对沿河同胞之要求，誓作后援。”太行区合作会议亦特别举行座谈，各代表均表愤慨，偏城合作社代表扬发旎说：“边区人民是一家，我们决不让反动派放水，坚决要求国民党当局，放弃一切阴谋，执行南京协议。”
