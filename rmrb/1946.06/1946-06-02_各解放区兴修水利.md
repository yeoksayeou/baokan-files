    Irrigation Projects Under Construction in Various Liberated Areas
    The Jizhong Area Cooperates Publicly and Privately to Repair the Hutuo River Irrigation Project
    The Total Length of Main and Branch Canals is Two Thousand Li - Striving to Complete it in the Next Two Years
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 25th] The Jizhong Administrative Office has started to repair the modernized irrigation canals of Jin County and Yuncheng. The canal starts from Huangbizhuang in Pingshan County in the west, and reaches the suburbs of Jin County in the east, running through the famous West River cotton producing area on both sides of the Shide Railway. Since the Japanese invaders occupied more than 73,000 mu of civilian land in 1932 to dig the canal, it took more than three years and countless compatriots' blood and sweat to initially complete it. A total of 1,952 main and branch canals were built, with a total length of 1,985 li. There were 421 large and small water gates operated by hoists, 1,600 tile pipe water gates, 73 bridges, and a large reservoir located near the Weishui Town of the Zhengtai Railway, specializing in guiding and regulating the water volume of the Hutuo River to irrigate the cotton producing area for a large amount of cotton planting. However, when the Japanese invaders announced their surrender, all kinds of equipment were destroyed. The project that the democratic government is undertaking to repair this year includes two main canals and all its branch and tributary canals, more than 100 water gates, and 10 bridges. The Shijiazhuang Dam of the first main canal, the Songcheng fourth branch canal, and the Jin County 19th branch canal are all striving to release water this year, which can irrigate more than 60,000 mu of land and increase grain production by more than 46,000 shi. Next year, the irrigation area is expected to increase to 160,000 mu. The Jizhong Administrative Office has determined that the canal is a public-private joint venture. The democratic governments of Jin and Song counties and the Administrative Office jointly organize a management committee to operate it. All the project costs and land price compensation are borne by the democratic government, and the earthwork of the branch and tributary canals is handled by the beneficiary households in cooperation.
    The Spring Repair of the Suwan Canal is Completed. The Chief Representative of UNRRA Unanimously Praises It
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 27th] All the spring repair projects of the canal in the Suwan Border Region will be completed by the end of May. The earthwork in the southern section was rushed to completion on May 7, and the projects in the central section were also completed in order ten days ago. The stonework of the three gate caves and the eleven roadwork sections of the entire section have also begun. The Zhanshang Bridge, which was funded by the Bianfu with 200,000 yuan, was completed on the 5th, and the bridge deck has been widened to 9 meters. The reasons why the canal projects at various places can be completed quickly are: (1) the exemplary role of the responsible personnel, such as the Xiaozhouzhuang section of the dike construction in the central section. Because the water level of the canal rose and flooded into the trough, the project could not proceed. Duan Guodong, the director of the engineering office, personally went into the water to do the dike construction, and everyone was moved and quickly completed the dike. The stonework of Qingjiang Zhengzha and Yueza in the central section also had gaps due to rain and water surge at the end of April. Director Zhang of the Water Conservancy Bureau personally led and mobilized 13 cadres and 96 workers to rush to repair day and night in the rain, so that the two projects could be completed as scheduled at the end of April. (2) All the personnel are united and hold production competitions. For example, the female workers in the Youfangzhuang section of Suqian County, under the leadership of the Women's Federation Chairman, competed with the male workers, so that the entire project progressed rapidly.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaian, 27th] Bi Pangpu, a water conservancy expert of the county, and Tu Da, director of the technical office of the UNRRA Jiangsu Office, arrived in Qingjiang from Zhenjiang on the 26th, bringing the specific plan of the UNRRA and the Suwan Border Government to negotiate and cooperate to establish a permanent water control organization for the North Canal. Chairman Li of the Bianfu met with Bi and Tu on the morning of the same day. Bi and Tu praised the canal project which can be completed in a short period of time.
    The Puppet Army in Cang County Creates a Flood; the Democratic Government Rushes to Rescue
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huimin, 29th] On the 10th of this month, the puppet army in Cang County destroyed the Jie River water gate south of the city in an attempt to flood large areas of wheat fields in the liberated area downstream and several villages on the north bank. The First Sub-district Command of our Bohai Sea and the Huanghua County Democratic Government immediately led the masses to block water into the river in the Luqiao area, and completed a ten-li river embankment with a width of five feet and a height of three feet within three days. The residents on the north bank have been blocking water day and night with earth and wood. Some of the flooded people have been rescued, and most of the wheat fields have been spared from the flood.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 27th] On the night of the 5th of this month, there was a heavy rain for four hours in the North Xin area of Huaibei, with about two feet of standing water on the flat ground. In Donghai and Tongyang, the lower reaches of the rivers were blocked by Liu Dayong and Zhou Facheng, the pseudo-bandits who were incorporated by the Kuomintang, resulting in floods and inundation of a total of 530,000 mu of wheat fields. The local government is now actively mobilizing the disaster victims to drain the water and carry out emergency rescue.

    各解放区兴修水利
    冀中区公私协力整修滹沱河水利
    主支渠共长两千里——争取今明两年修竣
    【新华社河间二十五电】冀中行署已动工修复装有近代化设备之晋县、运城的灌溉大渠，沿渠西迄平山县之黄壁庄，东抵晋县城郊，贯穿于石德路两侧之著名的西河产棉区，该渠自日寇于三十二年抢占民地七万三千余亩从事修凿以来，历时三年余，耗费同胞无数血汗，始粗具规模，共修成主支渠一千九百五十二道，长达一千九百八十五里，全部有卷扬机操着的大小水闸四百二十一座，瓦管水闸一千六百座，桥梁七十三处，及座落于正太路微水镇附近的大蓄水池一处，专门引导调节滹沱河水量，灌溉棉产区，以供大量播种棉花之用。但该水渠于日寇宣布投降时，各种设备被破坏殆尽。民主政府今年从事修复的工程，计包括主渠两道及其全部支渠、细渠和水闸百余座、桥梁十座。第一主渠之石家庄大闸，嵩城第四支渠，及晋县第十九支渠，均争取于今年放水，可灌地六万余亩，增产粮食四万六千余石，明年灌溉面积当可增至十六万亩。冀中行署已确定该渠为公私合营性质，晋、嵩两县民主政府及行署，共同组织管理委员会经营。其全部工程，及补偿地价的费用，均由民主政府负担，支渠细渠的土工，则由受益户合作办理。
    苏皖运河春修告竣  联总行总代表一致赞扬
    【新华社淮阴二十七电】苏皖边区境内，运河全部春修工程，均将于五月底竣工，南段土工已于五月七日抢修完成，中段工程亦于十日前次第竣工，全段三个闸洞石工及十一段路工亦已开始。前边府拨款二十万修建之闸上大桥，已于五日落成，桥面已放宽至九公尺。按运河各处工程得已迅速完成的原因：（一）为负责人员之模范作用，如中段埽工小周庄一段，因运河水位高涨，淹入槽内，工程无法进行，工程处处长段国栋，即亲自下水做埽工，大家受了感动迅速将埽做成。中段的清江正闸、越闸两处石工，在四月底亦因雨水涨冲，有缺口之处，水利局张局长即亲自领导动员干部十三人，工人九十六名，连天冒雨抢修，使该两处工程得以在四月底如期完工。（二）全体人员均团结一致，并举行生产竞赛，如宿迁油坊庄工段上女工，在妇女会长领导下，与男工比赛，使整个工程迅速进行。
    【新华社淮安二十七日电】县总水利专家毕庞圃、行总苏署分署技术室主任屠达两氏于二十六日自镇江至清江，携来联总方面与苏皖边府协商合作建立北运河永久性治水机构之具体方案，当日上午即由边府李主席接见，毕、屠两氏盛边在短时期内即能完成之运河工程。
