　　Sharing Weal and Woe with the People
    Our Army Participates in Dyke Repair
    [Report from Heze by Our Newspaper] In the Jiluyu Region, in addition to the joint efforts of the government and the people to restore dykes and harness the river, the People's Army – the Eighth Route Army – also actively participated in this massive project. The Kunshan Brigade of the Second Sub-district lived with the masses repairing the dykes, protecting them from sabotage by special agents; all officers and soldiers pitched in to help the masses repair the dykes, constantly encouraging their enthusiasm for the work. They also often helped families of the dyke-repairing masses carry water. In the villages where they were stationed, almost every household had a full water tank. Cadets of the Second Detachment of the Jiluyu Military Region's Training School actively carried out surveying work in the vicinity of Juancheng despite the heavy wind and sand. The people along the river were deeply impressed by the spirit of their own soldiers in serving the people.

　　与民共甘苦
    我军参加修堤
    【本报荷泽讯】冀鲁豫区复堤治河，除政民协力进行外，边区人民子弟兵——八路军亦积极参加了这一浩大工程。二分区昆山大队即与修堤群众住在一起，一面保护修堤群众，防止特务破坏；一面则全体指战员均动手帮助群众修堤，不断鼓舞群众的修堤热情，并经常帮助修堤群众的家庭挑水，在他们的驻村里，差不多家家户户的水缸都是满满的。冀鲁豫军区随营学校第二队的学员，在鄄城一带在大风砂里积极进行测量。沿河群众，对自己的子弟兵此种为人民服务的精神，均极感佩。
