    Hebei's Famous Cotton Weaving Area
    Gaoyang's Native Cloth Industry Revives
    (Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 3rd) The folk textile industry in Gaoyang County, a famous cotton weaving area in Hebei Province, has now been revitalized. In the Chengguan District alone, farmers operate 385 looms and 660 spinning wheels, producing 336 bolts of native cloth and more than 400 catties of cotton yarn per day. Although there are no complete statistics on the textile industry in rural districts and villages, the average of 8,120 bolts of native cloth and more than 10,020 catties of cotton yarn available at each market fair indicates a remarkable recovery and prosperity. Before the incident (likely referring to the Second Sino-Japanese War), the decline of Gaoyang's folk textile industry was due to the severe exclusion by foreign cloth and yarn. Furthermore, most weaving households were controlled by speculative merchants who heavily exploited them by supplying raw materials and selling finished products, forcing them to go bankrupt. Now, the public-operated stores and cooperatives organized by the weavers themselves handle tasks such as supplying raw materials and selling finished products, so the democratic government provides funds and tools at low interest rates. The vigorous development of the folk textile industry has simultaneously promoted the rapid recovery of related industries. Currently, the number of cloth shops in Gaoyang City has increased to 31, dye houses to 9, and small factories to 12.

    河北著名棉织区
    高阳土布业复兴
    【新华社河间三日电】河北省著名的棉织区——高阳县的民间纺织业现已振兴起来，仅城关区农户经营的织布机即有三百八十五张，纺车六百六十辆，日制土布三百三十六匹，棉织四百余斤。乡、村区纺织业现虽尚无完整的统计，但就每集上市的土布平均共达八千一百二十匹，棉线达一万二十余斤的数字看来，恢复与繁荣情形极为可观。事变前高阳民间纺织业衰落的原因，除受洋布洋纱剧烈排斥外，一般织户目多受投机商人的控制，午彼等供给原料及销售成品中间剥削重重，以致被迫纷纷破产。现在关于供给原料推销成品等任务，均由公营商店与织户自己所组织的合作社经手办理，所以资金工具等由民主政府低利贷给。因民间纺织业的蓬勃开展；同时推动了有关各业的迅速恢复，现高阳城内布庄已增至三十一家，染坊九家，小型工厂十二家。
