    Over Forty Counties and Eight Hundred Thousand People Involved in the Struggle
    The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Mass Movement Spreads Like Wildfire
    Over ten thousand cadres rushed to the new districts to lead, shifting from the tenant farmer movement to a widespread people's movement of countering traitors and settling accounts, resulting in more gains in one month than in the past several months.

    [Our newspaper's report from Heze] Since May, the mass movement in this region has shifted from the tenant farmer movement to a magnificent anti-traitor, account-settling, and grievance-airing movement by the broad masses of the people. Over 800,000 people in more than forty counties throughout the region have launched struggles against traitors, local bullies, and feudal landlords. Under the extreme importance and personal guidance of leading comrades, over ten thousand cadres from all levels and departments have entered the newly liberated areas. In Linze County, the grievance-airing and account-settling movement caused a sensation throughout the county within half a month. Twelve sub-districts launched joint accusations, and fifteen traitors and local bullies, including Wang Cunxiu and Chen Lianke, were struggled against. Over 100,000 people attended the meetings. In just four districts, over 40,000 people publicly tried the murderers from the "Tanhua Mansion," the "Second Commander." The political gains in this short half-month exceeded those of the previous three months. The masses of all strata recognized that the Communist Party and the democratic government were truly eliminating harm for the people, enabling them to avenge their grievances and settle their scores. Heze City opened up a new situation in the first half of the month (as reported previously). In Boping County, over ten thousand people settled accounts with the traitor and local bully Zhang Youcai, accusing him of burying and assassinating five people in the past and raping Zhang Zhanyuan's wife, while the man was conscripted into the Japanese army. In Chizhuang Village alone, fifteen families were bankrupted by extortion. In the second district of Wenshang, landlord Fan Fuguan colluded with bandits to kill the hired worker Yang Wodi. Over seven thousand people from more than one hundred villages in the second district jointly struggled to avenge Yang Wodi, and the murderer × Chao Rui paid with his life. The mass movement in the new district of Shanxian and Yutai gained significant development within ten days. The number of people participating in the organization reached over 3,300, more than four times the achievements of a month and a half of solely engaging in the tenant farmer and poor peasant movement. Nineteen of the twenty-two central villages have been broken through, conducting fifty-four struggles and recovering property worth over 4.5 million border currency. On the 14th, the masses in twenty-two villages in the fourth district of Dingtao jointly struggled against the traitor Huang Hongqi. The mass movement in various places is now further developing in an in-depth and broad direction.
