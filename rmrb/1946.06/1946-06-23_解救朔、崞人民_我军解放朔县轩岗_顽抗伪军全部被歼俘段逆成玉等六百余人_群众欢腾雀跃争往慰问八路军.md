　　Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 20th. Since the ceasefire order, puppet troops in the northern section of the Tongpu Railway have continuously attacked liberated areas, slaughtering many people wherever they go. Local people have repeatedly accused the puppet traitors of their crimes to our army, requesting our army to rescue them. At the request of the people of Shuo and Guo counties, our Eighth Route Army disarmed the puppet troops under Duan Chengyu in Xuangang, Shuo County, and other places on the 15th of this month. Unexpectedly, these puppets blindly resisted, leading to two days of fierce fighting. On the 17th, we liberated Shuo County City, Qianzhai (ten li south of Shuo County), Xuangang (twenty li northwest of Guo County), and other places along the Tongpu line. The puppet troops defending the above-mentioned areas were completely annihilated. In Shuo County alone, preliminary investigations reveal that over 650 people, including traitor Duan Chengyu and his subordinates, were captured. More than 50 light and heavy machine guns, 2 mortars, more than 500 rifles and carbines, more than 10 boxes of gunpowder, 2 cars, and countless other military supplies were seized. Duan Chengyu's puppet army in Shuo County was originally a puppet police force in Datong, later reorganized by Yan Xishan into the 45th Regiment of the 15th Provincial Defense Army. The Xuangang puppet army was originally the Ningwu puppet security team, reorganized by Yan Xishan into the 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of the 40th Division. Now they have been completely eliminated by the Eighth Route Army. Upon hearing the news, the masses cheered and leaped for joy, vying to console the Eighth Route Army.

    【新华社兴县二十日电】同蒲北段伪军，自停战令后不断向解放区进攻。所到之处，人民被残杀甚众。当地人民屡向我军控诉伪逆罪行，并要求我军解救。我八路军应朔、崞人民之请，于本月十五日解除盘据朔县轩岗等地之伪军段成玉等部武装。不料该伪等，竟盲目抵抗，激战两日。于十七日我已将同蒲线上之朔县城、前寨（朔县南十里）、轩岗（崞县西北二十里）等地解放。防守上述各地之伪军，全部被歼灭。仅朔县一地，据初步清查结果，即俘获段逆成玉以下六百五十余人，缴轻重机枪五十余挺，迫击炮两门，长短枪五百余枝，火药十余箱，汽车二辆，及其他军用品无算。按朔县伪军段成玉部，原为大同伪警，后被阎锡山改编为省防军十五军四十五团。轩岗伪军原为宁武伪保安队，被阎锡山编为四十师三团三营。今被八路军全部解决。群众闻讯，莫不欢腾雀跃，争往慰问八路军。
