    UNRRA Relief Expert Rhodes, etc.
    Hasten Back to Nanjing to Petition for the People
    "I want to go to Nanjing to urge those gentlemen sitting at big desks!"
    [Heze 16th dispatch] Rhodes (an American), an UNRRA relief expert, inspected the situation of the Xin Jian (New Construction) village in the old course of the Yellow River on the 12th, accompanied by Peng Anjie, director of the UNRRA office in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, and Han Sen. He planned to go directly to Haikou via Jinan for inspection after the visit. When Rhodes and his party arrived in Shou Zhang, they saw that the residents of the old course had not received any relief at all, and the people were panicked, which was pitiful. Moreover, the working masses were bringing their own food because the work grain had not been distributed yet, and some were busy grinding sorghum flour, unable to work. Rhodes and others deeply felt that the supply and relief were far behind the project's progress. He resolutely changed the original plan and returned on the 13th and hastened back to Nanjing on the 14th. Rhodes and others said angrily, "We want to go to Nanjing to urge those gentlemen sitting at big desks!" Before leaving, Rhodes and others also expressed their willingness to adopt the same opinion as the Yellow River Committee of the Liberated Areas, and the closure project must not continue until after autumn this year.

    联总救济专家罗惠士等
    遄返南京为民陈情
    “我要去南京督促那些坐在大办公桌子上的老爷们！”
    【荷泽十六日电】联总救济专家罗惠士（美人），于十二日偕联总驻冀鲁豫区办事主任彭安杰及韩森等视察黄河故道新建村情形，并拟视察完毕后，经济南直赴海口视察。罗等行至寿张，见故道居民仍未得丝毫救济，人心惶惶，其情可悯，且上工群众，因工粮尚未发下，均自带粮食，部分正忙于磨高粱面，无法上工。罗等深感供给及救济远落于工程之后，用毅然变更原订计划，于十三日折回，十四日遄返南京，罗等愤然说：“我们要去南京督促那些坐在大办公桌上的老爷们”！行前罗等并表示愿与解放区黄委会采取一致意见，堵口工程须至今年秋后始能继续进行。
