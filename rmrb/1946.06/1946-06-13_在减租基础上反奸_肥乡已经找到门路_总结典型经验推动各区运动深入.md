    Anti-Treason on the Basis of Rent Reduction
    Feixiang Has Found a Way
    Summarize Typical Experiences to Promote the In-Depth Movement in Various Districts
    [Our Newspaper, Weixian News] Since Feixiang in the Third Military Sub-district launched the anti-treason and revenge movement, all districts have now opened the door to the movement. However, the cadres' thinking is still not clear enough, and the leadership is still somewhat paternalistic, which has become the biggest obstacle in the current movement. (1) Many comrades have not fully considered how to carry out the anti-treason and grievance movement on the basis of the past rent reduction movement, and how to carry out the rent reduction movement immediately after the anti-treason movement. Some believe that there is already a foundation for the rent reduction movement, so it is easy to mobilize, but they have not considered that the strength of the masses is still quite weak and isolated, and has not yet fully formed a leading core. Some believe that the traitors have been dealt with by the government, their property has been confiscated, and some small-scale liquidations are meaningless. In addition, the fascist reactionaries have launched a civil war, and the masses have some concerns, so they have no ideas in the process, and the anti-treason movement has not been launched quickly and widely. (2) The anti-treason accusation movement must mobilize all classes of people who have been oppressed and extorted by the enemy and puppets to speak out their grievances and seek revenge, but some areas (such as the Third District) are afraid of middle peasants participating in the leadership and sharing the fruits, and are unwilling to absorb middle peasants, or only absorb them individually, and refuse rich peasants and oppressed middle and small landlords from participating in the movement, which is very good. The leadership also has some purely economic views. Because they are eager to solve the people's livelihood problems, they subjectively want to seek benefits for the people, so paternalism is very serious. They look down on the masses, dislike their backwardness, and do not want to find various ways to enlighten the masses, so the movement cannot be carried out quickly. Based on the above situation, the leadership has summarized the experience of the anti-treason struggle in Xiaoying, Sanlidi, Fifth District, in order to further promote the in-depth development of the anti-treason movement in various districts. (1) In the process of connecting and brewing, it is necessary to solve various ideological difficulties of the masses at any time according to the requirements of the masses to implement leadership and mobilization. (2) The masses in the new district generally have a wait-and-see attitude, so it is very important to educate activists to play a leading role. Otherwise, the masses will not see the activities of the activists and feel that there is no reliance, and the activists will not see the strength of the masses and will not have the courage to do it. (3) Organizing mutual support among the activists of a village is a good way to promote the movement. For example, when Ying struggled against Cui Jinduo, everyone's confidence was not high enough. Xue Qiao, a representative of the peasants from the Fourth District, said at the mass meeting in the village: "If Cui Jinduo, such a traitor, is not liquidated, the poor will have no chance to turn over and get ahead. Folks, let's do it! If you can't figure it out, our whole village will help. If you still can't figure it out, I can mobilize the whole district to help." After saying this, everyone's emotions became even higher. (4) When the brewing and connecting reach a certain level, a few people are still skeptical and have many concerns before they see their own strength, fearing that everyone will not be of one mind. Jiaoying and Sanli seized this opportunity, carried out an oath, and everyone expressed their attitude, and the movement greatly moved forward.

    在减租基础上反奸
    肥乡已经找到门路
    总结典型经验推动各区运动深入
    【本报威县讯】三分区肥乡自发动反奸复仇以来，现在各区都已打开了运动的大门。但在干部思想上仍不够明确，领导上仍然有些包办代替，成为当前运动中的最大障碍；（一）反奸诉苦运动如何在过去减租运动的基础上进行，以及如何在反奸之后紧接着搞减租运动，许多同志在这点上考虑不周，有的认为已有减租运动的基础了，好发动得很，而没考虑到群众力量还是相当单薄与孤立，还没有完全形成领导的核心。有的认为，汉奸被政府处理了，财产没收了，有些小的清算也没意思，加之法西斯反动派又发动内战，广大群众思想有些顾虑，所以在进行中就没主意，因而反奸运动没有迅速广泛的开展起来。（二）反奸控诉运动必须发动受敌伪欺压敲诈的各阶层群众起来诉苦复仇，但有些地区（如三区）怕中农参加领导和分果实，不愿吸收中农，或仅是个别的吸收，将富农及受欺压的中小地主拒绝于运动之外，这是很好的。在领导上也有些单纯经济观点，由于急于解决群众生活问题，主观上想给群众谋利益，因而包办代替是很严重的，看不起群众，嫌他们落后，不想各种办法去启发群众，因此运动不能迅速开展。根据上述情形领导上特总结五区三里堤三分区小营的反奸斗争经验，以推进各区反奸运动进一步深入开展。（１）在串连酝酿中要随串连随组织随时解决群众思想上的各种疑难，要根据群众的要求实行领导与发动。（２）新区群众一般的都有观望心理，因此教育积极分子起带头作用是很重要的。不然群众看不到积极份子的活动，觉得没有依靠，积极分子看不见群众力量，就没有勇气干。（３）组织一片村庄积极份子群众的互相声援，这是推动运动前进的好办法。如营斗争崔金铎时，大家信心还不够高，四区农民代表薛乔等人在该村群众大会上说：“崔金铎这种汉奸如果不清算，贫苦人就没翻身出头之日，乡亲们干吧！你们算不了，我们全村帮助，再算不下去，我可发动全区帮助。”如此一说大家情绪就更高起来。（４）酝酿串连到一定程度时，少数群众在看不到自己力量前，仍是怀疑和多顾虑，怕大家不一条心，焦营，三里抓紧了这个火候，实行宣誓，一个个的都表示了自己的态度，运动就大大向前推进了一步。
