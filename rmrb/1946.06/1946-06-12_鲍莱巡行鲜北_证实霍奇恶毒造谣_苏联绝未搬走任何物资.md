Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th. According to the US News Agency, Seoul: After inspecting Northern Korea for five days, Bowles, representative of the US Reparations Committee, told a New York Times correspondent on the 5th: According to my inspection, the main items were not moved on a large scale. He had seen 60% of the heavy industry. He also inquired about the rumors that the Soviet army had moved supplies, asking General Chistiakov, the commander of the Soviet army in Northern Korea. Chistiakov replied that no supplies had been transported to the Soviet Union, and said that the policy of the Soviet high authorities was to prevent the removal of supplies. General Chi expressed indignation at the rumors. Finally, regarding the overall situation of industry in Northern Korea, Bowles admitted: "Before ownership and working conditions are determined, it is in line with our policy of opposing the removal of major supplies." It is reported that at the US-Soviet meeting held in Seoul at the end of March, US military commander Hodge was unwilling to discuss how the US and the Soviet Union should contact each other, but insisted on discussing the so-called Soviet army's removal of machines from Korea, which caused the meeting to stagnate. Bowles's remarks this time show that Hodge's claim and the US telegraph's claim that the Soviet Union moved machines were purely vicious slander.

    鲍莱巡行鲜北
    证实霍奇恶毒造谣
    苏联绝未搬走任何物资
    【新华社延安九日电】据美新闻处汉城讯：美赔偿委员会代表鲍莱在巡行鲜北五天返汉城后，五日对纽约时报特派员称：据吾视察的结果，主要物品未被大规模搬走。他已看到百分之六十的重工业。并曾就外传苏军搬走物资谣言询问鲜北苏军司令希蒂科夫将军，希蒂科夫答称：绝无任何物资运往苏联，并说苏高级当局之政策，乃在阻止物资之搬走。希将军对外传各节表示愤慨。最后，关于鲜北工业整个情形，鲍莱承认：“在所有权及工作情形未经决定前，与吾人反对搬走主要物资之政策相吻合”。按美军司令霍奇于三月底在汉城举行的美苏会谈中，不愿讨论美苏如何联系问题，而坚主讨论所谓苏军运走朝鲜境内机器问题，致使会议停滞。此次鲍莱之谈话，说明霍奇之主张以及美方电讯所传苏联搬走机器云云，纯系恶毒之造谣。
