　　What Does the Soviet Union Want?
    Saslavsky
    Note: The American "New York Times" asked Saslavsky, the editor-in-chief of the Soviet Communist Party's "Pravda," a question: "What does the Soviet Union want?" Saslavsky replied that the Soviet Union's goal is "a sincere peace." The following is the full text of Saslavsky's reply. It was telegraphed to the United States and published in the April 14th "New York Times Magazine."

    I am not formally authorized to speak on behalf of my country, I am speaking only in a private capacity, as a free Russian journalist, as a patriot of the Soviet Republic. But I deeply believe that my personal opinion is the same as that of millions of my compatriots, so I decided to speak for myself about what the Soviet Union wants, what the men and women of the Soviet Union want?

    First of all, we want peace, a real, lasting, honest peace. The Soviet state is young, only twenty-eight years old, but in this short period of time, it has suffered several attacks. Some governments have adopted a policy of isolation, blockade, and political intimidation in their relations with the Soviet Union. The main burden of World War II fell on the shoulders of our country, causing us great losses and suffering. In the war against Germany, nearly seven million Soviet people died as a result of German occupation and enslavement.

    We want peace, which is not only our wish but also a fundamental need. In our country, there are no classes, no political groups, and no individuals who get rich from war. We have no arms dealers, no war profiteers who capitalize on human lives. We are united in our efforts to strive for peace.

    Now that a glorious victory has been achieved, we hope to begin peaceful work. We want to restore our devastated economy so that our people's living standards can be raised and our country can become prosperous and strong. We have all the necessary conditions—natural resources, hardworking people, and talented men and women. We do not need anything that belongs to anyone else.

    We have no intention of encroaching on the territory of other countries, we do not want any buffer zones, and we do not believe that we are superior to any nation and must therefore control them. We hope to be friendly with all peace-loving people, and we are willing to maintain economic and cultural ties with them.

    American technology has been of great help to the realization of our Five-Year Plans, and American talent has contributed to the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station and other great enterprises in socialist industry. We remember this and are grateful. We also gratefully remember the assistance given to us by the Allied countries in the anti-German fascist war. In the war, our contribution to all peace-loving countries was also immeasurable. We hope that the exchange of economic and cultural goods during the war can continue to develop.

    We do not have feelings of national arrogance, we are accustomed to respecting the achievements of other peoples. We know that other countries can also respect us in the same way, and we feel that we have already gained this respect. Our history is a glorious history, and Russian literature and Russian art have greatly enriched world culture. The heroism of our people in the anti-fascist war has won unanimous recognition in all countries of the world where the noble spirit can be respected. We have also heard protests of friendship, and we believe in them, because our people will never be overly suspicious. However, although the Soviet state is young, we have gained a lot of experience, and we will never be satisfied with excessive trust. Our history and path have encountered many conspiracies and traps from the beginning, and more than once, in those protests of love for us, there are hidden and prepared blows!

    We need loyal friends all over the world, and first of all we must have reliable neighbors. We do not live on the moon, we live on the earth—a sinful earth at all times, because history and geography will not give us friendly neighbors, until the Second World War, preparations to attack us were reaching our doorstep. Pre-war Poland was only a nominally independent country, but in reality, it was dominated by fascists and imperialists. Various fascist governments of Raczkiewicz and Anders, Antonescu and Tiso aimed at inciting their people's hatred of the Soviet people.

    Representatives of governments hostile to the Soviet Union, along with agents of international monopoly trusts, were involved everywhere, because the international trusts were never satisfied with the independent existence of the Soviet state. Today, after the victory of the Red Army and the liberation of the people of Eastern Europe, our country has established good-neighborly relations with the people of Poland, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, and other countries for the first time. These countries are now truly independent and fully democratic.

    This is why the Soviet people are paying such close attention to foreign interference in these countries. Foreign forces are trying to send the infamous Anders back to Poland, or Manniu back to Romania! The friendly relations between the Soviet people and their neighbors are the best guarantee of peace in Europe, and this can also be applied to Iran. If Iran is controlled by foreign imperialist trusts one day, it cannot become a powerful independent country capable of maintaining neighborly relations with the Soviet Union. We look forward to a free and democratic Iran. Because only in this way can it implement the interests of its own people.

    We believe that those European politicians—not only German fascists, but also British reactionaries—although they are always sowing the seeds of hatred towards the Soviet Union, can hardly destroy our friendship with our neighbors. They believe that the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Southeast European countries are a threat to their imperialist positions. We regret that this British disease has also infected some American politicians.

    Does the friendship between the Soviet Union and democratic Poland, democratic Bulgaria, and other countries threaten the interests of the American people? We believe that we live in a world that respects strong countries, and in this world, a large, weak, and peaceful country is not enviable. We understand our own strength, and like all true strongmen, we are humble. Humility is a well-known characteristic of the Russian character. War is a test of our strength and our desire for peace, and we have every reason to be satisfied with the results of this test. The Soviet people showed that they were fearless in combat—they fought calmly and confidently, and never wavered or panicked. Stalin's calm confidence was transmitted to the entire people. We only saw our strong captain standing at the helm, once again steering our country through a dangerous storm. Each of us held our breath and shared his responsibility, whether on the front lines or in the rear.

    Today, as peace is unfolding, we are just as calm, and any malicious shouts against us cannot make us panic. But we do not have the innate virtue of obedience, we sternly denounce slander, and we do not want to show excessive humility to outrageous lies. We condemn the riots, we like to speak frankly and directly. For example, when we hear the rattling of machine guns somewhere in East India, we will never believe that we are listening to pleasant music.

    We have a sense of humor, which is part of our humble character. It is no accident that Mark Twain is always popular in our country. When we debate important issues, this sense of humor arises spontaneously. If anyone is interested in our views on this aspect, I can advise him in a friendly and loyal way that the best way to deal with us is to adopt a realistic and business-like attitude, just as you would deal with another great power that you value equally.

    Because we know our own worth, we are not intimidated. In the early days of American history, the warlike Indians painted their faces and bodies to intimidate their enemies, and they also danced savage dances to show their strength and courage. But in today's international relations, this kind of "nerve tactics" used by the Indians must be abandoned.

    Some reporters are dancing war-mongering dances, and they also say that a new "anti-solo dance" has replaced the "solo dance." We are not moved by these at all. However, we will never underestimate the threat to peace.

    Because we desire peace, we are objective. We objectively understand that the United Nations organization should become an institution for democratic cooperation among countries, and we do not want to turn them into tools for the enemies of democracy and vicious aggressors. We want to see this organization grow stronger and become a real force, which is why we must oppose any irresponsible handling. Therefore, it can be said that any conspiracy against the Soviet Union threatens the democracy of the entire world. Our country is built on the basis of the moral and political unity of the entire people. Although we do not insist that all countries have to follow the same path of historical development as us, we will never allow what we consider to be the appropriate way of life to be hindered by external forces.

    The success of the Soviet state and social system has led to the emergence and existence of a united nation. Regardless of their masks and trademarks, the Soviet people abhor fascism without reservation. In our country, there cannot be any party, group, or individual who will forgive fascists and compromise with them. In our country, there is no such thing as racial and ethnic discrimination, our consciousness is based on the recognition of the equality of all races and ethnic groups.

    This is the source of our national strength, and it is also the source of our victory in the war. It is precisely because of this that our country has become an unshakable fortress of democracy, but those critics who hold old ideas still cannot understand us and refuse to admit that Soviet democracy is a new type of state form. (Missing hundreds of words in the middle) We are very happy that not only are we learning from others, but in some places others are also learning from us. We are constantly learning, and we do not object to others learning from our experience. The mutual exchange of experience is a natural process of historical development.

    We know that there are people in the world whose special hobby is to meddle in the furnishings of other people's houses. Some people even like to decorate the interior of the whole of Europe according to American and British tastes. Once the countries concerned insist on handling their own internal affairs in a way that suits them, these people will make a big fuss. We will never force others to adopt the Soviet way to arrange their homes, we advocate letting our neighbors handle their affairs in their own way, but in our own home, we hope to live a peaceful and quiet life, without quarrels and disputes from next door, we are willing to look at the world from our own windows, and like any gatekeeper, we need to keep the key to the door in our own pocket. This, as I see it, is basically what we want.

### 苏联要的是什么？

　　苏联要的是什么？
    萨斯拉夫斯基
    按：美国“纽约时报”向苏联共产党捷关报“真理报”的总编辑萨斯拉夫斯基提出一个问题：“苏联要的是什么”？萨氏回答说：苏联的目标是“一个真诚的和平”。下面就是萨氏答复的全文。用无线电拍到美国，在四月十四日“纽约时报周刊”上刊裁出来的。
    我不是正式奉令代表我的国家来说话，我只是以私人资格，以一个自由的俄国新闻记者的资格，以苏维埃共和国爱国者的资格来说的。但我深深地相信，我个人的意见正与我千百万同国人的意见相同，因此，我就决定自己来说说苏联要的是什么，苏联的男男女女要的是什么？
    首先我们要和平，一种真正的持久的诚实的和平。苏维埃国家是年青的，她不过二十八岁，但在这一段短短时间中，她曾遭受到好几次的进攻。有些政府在对苏联关系上，采取了一种孤立封锁和政治恫吓的政策。第二次世界大战的主要负担，落到了我们国家的肩上，使我们受到了极大的损失和痛苦，在抗德战争中，由于德军的占领和奴役的结果，几乎有七百万的苏联人民死亡了。
    我们要和平，这不仅是我们的愿望，也是根本的需要。在我们国家中，没有阶级，没有政治集团，也没有靠战争发财的个人，我们没有军火商人，也没有拿人类生命作资本的战争渔利者。在我们争取和平的努力上，我们是一致的。
    现在光荣的胜利已经取得了，我们希望开始和平的工作。我们要恢复我们残破的经济，以使我们人民的生活水准提高，使我们的国家富强。我们具备了一切必然的条件——自然的富源，勤劳刻苦的人民，以及有才能的男女。我们不需要属于任何别人的任何东西。
    我们没有打算别国领土的企图，我们不想什么中介空间，我们也不相信我们比任何民族都优秀，从而必须控制他们。我们希望跟一切和平的人民友好，我们也愿意跟他们维持经济和文化的联系。
    美国技术对于我们五年计划的实现有不少的帮助，美国的才能对于德涅泊水电站和社会主义工业中其他伟大的企业都有贡献。我们记住这一点，而且感谢。我们还满意地铭记着同盟国在反德国法西斯战争中所给予我们的帮助，在战争中，我们对于一切爱好和平国家的贡献，也是不可数计的。我们希望在战争时期中，经济和文化的买卖交换，仍能一样发展。
    民族自大的感情我们是没有的，我们贯于尊敬别国人民的成就。我们知道别国也能一样尊敬我们，我们觉得是已经获得这种尊敬了。我们的历史是一部灿烂的历史，俄国的文学和俄国的艺术，使世界文化大为丰富。我们人民在反法西斯战争中的英勇，已经在那崇高精神能受尊敬的世界各国中，获得了一致的公认。我们也听到了友谊的抗议，我们是相信我们的，因为我们的人民决不过份猜疑。不过苏维埃的国家尽管年青，我们却也获得了许多经验，我们决不满足于过度的信任，我们历史和道路，一开始就碰到好多的阴谋陷井，不止一次地，那对我们友爱的抗议里，暗蔽和准备打击的刀哩！
    我们需要全世界忠实的朋友，首先我们要有可靠的邻居，我们不是住在月亮里，我们住在地球上——一个随时有罪恶的地球上，因为历史和地理不会赐予我们友谊的邻居，直到第二次大战时，进攻我们的准备正在达到了我们的门口。战前的波兰只是一个名义上独立的国家，实际上她是法西斯主义者和帝国主义者。拉安维茨和安德斯们，安多莱斯哥和唐纳们的各种各样的法西斯政府，都以挑拨他们人民对苏维埃人民的仇恨为目的。
    仇视苏联的各政府的代表，于国际独占托辣斯的代理人，到处插手活动着，因为国际托辣斯是绝不满意苏联国家经刘独立存在的。今天当此红军胜利和东欧各国人民获得解放之后，我们国家已跟波兰、南斯拉夫、保加利亚、罗马尼亚以及其他各国的人民，第一次树立了善邻的关系。这些国家现在已是真正的独立，而且充分的民主了。
    这就是苏维埃人民为什么要这样迫切注意外力干涉这些国家的原因。外力正在企图把声名狼藉的安德斯送回波兰，或者把曼努送还给马尼亚呢！苏联人民跟他们邻国的友好关系，正是欧洲和平最好的保证，这也可以同样应用于伊朗，伊朗如其一天受外国帝国主义托辣斯的操纵，她就不可能成为一个有力的能够与苏联维持邻国关系的独立国家。我们期望着一个自⑴⑵由民主的伊朗。因为只有这样才能执行它自己人民的利益。
    我们相信那些欧洲政治家——不单是德国的法西斯，英国的反动派也一样——虽然老是散播着仇视苏联的种子，但结果几乎无法破坏我们跟邻国的友谊。他们认为苏联跟东南欧国家的友善关系，乃是对他们帝国主义职位的威胁，我们很婉惜这种英国的病症，不仅使美国的若干政治家也受了传染。
    苏联跟民主的波兰，民主的保加利亚，以及其他国家的友谊，究竟威胁了美国人民利益没有呢？我们认为我们是生活在一个尊敬强国的世界中，在这个世界里，一大懦弱小和平国，是并不受羡慕的。我们明白自己的强大，将正跟所有真正的强者一样，我们是谦和的。谦和正是俄罗斯性格出名的特点。战争是我们力量与我们和平愿望的考验，我们有充分的理由满意于这次考验的结果，苏维埃人民表现了他们在作战时候是毫不畏惧的——他们沉着自信地战斗，从不曾有动摇和惊慌。斯大林沉着的自信力，是传导给整个人民了。我们只见我们坚强的船长站在船头上，把我们国家再一次从险恶的风暴中驶过去。我们每一个人都屏息是分担了他的责任，无论在前线或后方。
    今天当和平正在开展的时候，我们也是同样地沉着，任何反对我们的恶意叫嚷，毫不能使我们慌乱。但我们也并非有天赋的驯服美德，我们严斥着诽谤，我们不想对滔天大谎表示过度的谦逊。我们责备着暴乱，我们喜欢坦率直言，举例说，当我们听到东印度什么地方机关枪声轧轧的时候，我们可决不会相信是在听着悦耳的音乐。
    我们有一种幽默感，这是造成我们谦和性格的一部分。马克吐温常受我国的欢迎，不是偶然的。当我们在重要问题的争论中，我们这种幽默感就会油然而生，谁要是对我们这方面的意见有兴趣，我可以用友谊忠告的方法告诉他，应付我们的最好方法，应该出以现实主义和事业的态度，正如应付一个同样重视的别的大国一样。
    正因为我们知道自己的价值，我们是不受恫吓的。当美国史的初期，好战的印第安人即把他们的脸孔和身体涂饰着，恐吓他们的敌人，并且还跳着野攒舞，以表他们的力量和勇敢。但在今天的国际关系中，象印第安人所用的这种“神经法”是必须放弃了。
    有些记者跳着战争恐吓的舞，他们还说新的“反孤步舞”已经代替了“孤步舞”。对于这些，我们是丝毫不为所动的。但是，我们也决不低估和平所受的威胁。
    正因为我们希望着和平，我们才是客观主义者。我们客观的了解，联合国机构应成为各国民主合作的机构，而不愿意使他们变为民主敌人和凶恶侵略者的工具，我们要看着这个机构强大起来，成为真正的力量，这就是我们一定反对任何不负责的处理的缘故。因此可以说，任何反对苏联的阴谋，也就威胁着整个世界的民主。我们的国家是建立在全体人民的道德和政治的统一的基础上，我们固然不坚持所有国家都得走上和我们历史发展的同样的路，但我们也决不愿让我们认为是适当生活方式受到外力的阻遏。
    苏维埃国家和社会制度的成功，已引起一联合国的产生和存在。不管他们的面具和商标如何，苏维埃人民痛恶法西斯主义是绝无余地的，在我们国家中，决不能少党派、集团和个人会宽恕法西斯主义者，会对他们妥协的。在我们国家中，没有种族和民族的歧视这回事，我们的意识是以承认一切种族和民族平等为基础的。
    这是我们国家力量的泉源，也就是我们战争胜利的源泉，正因为如此，才使我们的国家成了民主的不可动摇的堡垒，不过那些抱着旧观念的批评者，却仍就不能了解我们，并且不肯承认苏维埃民主是一种新型的国家形式。（中缺百字）我们很高兴，不但是我们向别人学习，而且有些地方别人也在向我们学习了，我们是要不断学习的，我们也不反对别人从我们的经验中学取益处，经验的互相交换，乃是历史发展的自然的过程。
    我们知道世界上有一种人，他们的特别嗜好就是过问人家屋子里的陈设，有些人还喜欢把整个欧洲的内部，依照美国和英国的风味来装饰，一旦有关各国坚持由适合自己的方式处理自己的内政时，这些人便大吵大闹起来。我们决不强迫别人一定要采取苏维埃的方式来安排他们的家，我们赞成让我们的房居照自己的方法去处理他们的事情，不过在我们自己的家里，我们却希望过着和平与安静的生活，若没有隔墙的吵闹与争论，我们愿意从我们自己的窗口看世界，而且正像任何看门者一样，我们需要把大门钥匙放在自己袋里。这个照我看来，便是我们基本上所要的。
