Xu Aixia, "Unfaithful to Her Husband"
Zhang Peili

When the peonies are budding and the roses are in full bloom, the villagers of Huangxu Village are working hard.

The mutual aid teams are sweating as they rush to sow seeds. The women are patiently pulling out the damaged wheat, their clothes soaked with sweat. They wipe their burning faces with towels.

Old ladies with gray hair in their sixties and seventies are also busy running around, delivering seeds, going to the kitchen, or watching over five or six young children by themselves.

"Let's work harder! The reactionaries won't let us rest. Chiang Kai-shek has flown to Xinxiang again! He's mobilizing his troops to attack us, the common people!" someone says among them.

Men, women, children, and the elderly, everyone is working hard and happy. Because they are confident they will surpass any previous year's production record.

However, only our landlady, Xu Aixia, is working actively and well, but she is very unhappy! Why? Because her husband refuses to accept it (Note).

At dusk, Xu Aixia tied the tired ox to the shed. The ox lazily stretched and stuck its mouth into the trough, starting to eat grass. Then she moved a stool for her husband and gave him a bowl of rice. Just as her husband took the bowl, that not-so-familiar person came to call him again.

"Look how busy you've been lately, running around day and night, not even eating properly. You don't want to accept it, your thinking is backward, always saying destructive things! What's really on your mind? You can't hide it from me..." Her eyes darted around, looking at her husband, then at the other person's face, as if she saw many secrets.

The husband didn't speak, didn't even look back, and left with that person.

"Hmph, you're busy! But busy with the wrong things!" Xu Aixia's expression became serious. She closed the door and ran to Director Han's room in the training corps.

She originally wanted to talk to Director Han about her husband's problem, but when she saw Director Han comforting his wife who had just come from the Kuomintang-controlled area, she temporarily changed her mind. She quickly interjected:

"Oh! Don't be pessimistic! What's making you unhappy today!" She stared at Director Han's wife with wide eyes.

"Good landlady! Yesterday I visited the textile mill and heard the women talking. I feel like I'm so behind!" Director Han's wife's eyes were filled with tears.

"Oh! You can't blame yourself! It's because your hometown doesn't have the Communist Party or the Eighth Route Army! You're also literate, and your husband is a political director. You'll definitely progress faster than us in the future," she continued, with a comforting expression.

"Let me tell you, before the Eighth Route Army came, my husband didn't even treat me like a person! He would lock me up at home whenever he went out. The year I got married, my mother told me, 'Marry a chicken, follow the chicken; marry a dog, follow the dog.' When I got to Huangxu, my mother-in-law told me, 'The daughter-in-law you marry, the horse you buy, you can ride and beat as you please.' I got slapped and punched a lot back then!

"Later, the Eighth Route Army came, and everyone rose up to fight the Japanese. Licheng is an old base area of the Eighth Route Army. At first, no one wanted to join the Women's Salvation Association. Some people said that only 'bad people' joined. But later, day by day, there were more and more 'bad people.' I secretly joined the Women's Salvation Association behind my mother-in-law's back. The first time I made a pair of good military shoes for the Eighth Route Army, my mother-in-law glared and pointed at me, saying, 'Why are you making such good military shoes for them!?'

"The year before last, we women went to winter school, and my mother-in-law went too. Here, I gradually understood that women are oppressed people, and the Eighth Route Army wants us women to stand up, break free from the shackles of the old society, and have the same equality and the same work as men. I used to regret that I was born a woman! Now no one has that thought anymore. The women in the liberated areas have all stood up, they are all free, and they have many rights."

"Anyway, listening to the Communist Party and following the Communist Party is never wrong!" she said very seriously and affirmatively in the end, looking at the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the wall.

"Chiang Kai-shek has flown to Xinxiang! Do you know that?" Director Han's wife asked her.

"We women knew it in class yesterday. We are not afraid of his attack. Last year, my brother from my mother's side was killed by the stubborn faction. But now, three nephews from my mother's side and my brother's son have all joined our field army. They want to avenge their father and uncle. The nephews know how their father and uncles died!" A kind of suppressed indignation seemed to force her to continue.

"Although I am a woman, I will do my part in fighting the stubborn elements. I am about to talk to Director Han about something, but this matter..." She seemed to have concerns.

"What is it? Tell us, there are no outsiders here, I'll take responsibility..." Director Han said solemnly.

"He and I are a couple, and our relationship is good. We should be a good couple, but his behavior has been very bad lately. I can't tolerate him. Tolerating him will harm everyone and harm myself! I want to tell the government that my husband is colluding with secret agents! These days they have been acting suspiciously, and strangers always come to find him. I ask him who they are, but he won't tell me!" Her eyes looked out the door, with a kind of reminiscent look, as if she now wanted to fully remember the appearance of that stranger.

"If you report your own husband, how will you live in the future!" Director Han's wife asked her in surprise.

"I have no personal grudges against him. Our relationship is very good. I am not divorcing him because of this, but I want to help him confess to the government. I can't do it alone, everyone can help. We must help him to change. Life will still be the same as before. He will farm, and I will spin cotton."

Director Han's wife was stunned. She looked at Xu Aixia, this woman with earrings and bound feet, thinking, "Maybe this is what the Kuomintang-controlled areas call a 'woman unfaithful to her husband!?' If she were now in the Kuomintang-controlled area, she would definitely be subject to 'legal sanctions.'"

Truly! The landlady's words were completely realized. After six or seven days of help and persuasion, on the evening of May 26th, Huangxu Village convened a self-renewal meeting to save Xu Aixia's husband. At the meeting, Xu Aixia worked hard to persuade her husband to confess to everyone.

"Tell everyone, what have you been busy with these days! Where is that secret agent boss? Who came to collude with you?" She lit a cigarette for her husband and sat next to him. The husband lowered his head, his face red, smoking, and answered haltingly.

"I am a dupe, that person..."
"................"

The villagers, tired from a day's labor, laughed under the lights. The women looked at Xu Aixia with joyful eyes.

"It should be like this! Xu Aixia did the right thing!" The masses shouted in unison!

(Note) 受 (Shou) - means to go to the fields to do farm work.
May 29, 1946, in Huangxu Village

    “不忠实自己丈夫”的徐爱夏
    张培礼
    芍药花吐着蓓蕾，玫瑰花盛开的时候，黄须村的庄户们在紧张的劳作。
    互助组汗流夹背的突击下种，妇女们很耐心的拔着坏了的麦子，汗已经浸湿了她们的衣衫，她们用手巾揩着火烫的脸。
    六七十岁花白头发的老太太，也忙着到处跑，送种子，下灶房，或者一个人看守着五六个小娃娃。
    “加油干吧！反动派不叫咱们消闲，蒋介石又飞到新乡啦！他在动员他的兵，向咱们老百姓进攻！”他们之间不知是谁在说着。
    男人，女人，孩子和老人，无论谁都在紧张的工作，都很快乐。因为他们有把握要超过以往任何一年的生产成绩。
    可是，这里边只有我们的女房东——徐爱夏，她工作积极，作的又好，但是她很不喜欢！为啥啦？因为她汉子不肯受。（注）
    黄昏，徐爱夏把疲劳的牛拴到牛棚里，牛懒懒的伸了一个腰，把嘴插到牛槽里，开始吃草，然后给自己的丈夫搬了一个坐杌，又送给他一碗饭，她丈夫刚接过碗，那个不很熟识的人就又来叫了。
    “看你近来忙成啥，黑天白日跑，饭也吃不下，不想受，思想落后，光说破坏话！你心里到底有啥事啦？你想瞒我可瞒不住………”她的眼珠滴溜溜的转，看看她丈夫，又看看那个人的脸，她好象看到许多秘密。
    丈夫不说话，头也不回，跟那人走了。
    “哼，你忙！可忙的不正经！”徐爱夏表情严肃起来，闭了房门，跑到教导团韩主任的房里。
    她本来是要找韩主任谈他丈夫的问题哩，可是她一见韩主任正在劝慰他那新从国民党统治区来的妻子。于是他也暂时变了主意。连忙插嘴说：
    “呀！你可不要悲观，今天啥事使你不高兴！”她瞪大眼睛望着韩主任的妻子。
    “好房东哩！昨天我参观了纺织，听到妇女们说的话，我觉得自己太落后啦！”韩主任的妻子眼里装满着泪珠。
    “呀！这可不能怪你！是因为你们家乡没有共产党八路军呀！你又识字，你男人也是政治主任，将来可要比我们进步快。”她带着安慰的表情又继续说着。
    “我告诉你，在八路军没来的时候，我男人并不把我看成人呀！他一出门就把我锁在家里。出嫁的那一年我母亲告诉我：“嫁鸡跟鸡飞，嫁狗跟狗走。”到了黄须来婆婆告我说：“娶到的儿媳，买到的马，由人骑由人打。”那时耳光拳头我可挨的不少哩！
    后来八路军来啦，大家一齐起来打日本，我们黎城是八路军的老根据地，一开始谁也不愿参加妇救会，有人说那是“坏了的人”才参加，可是后来，一天一天这“坏了的人”多起来，我也背着婆婆悄悄的参加了妇救会。第一次我给八路军做了一双好军鞋，婆婆瞪起眼睛指着说：“你给他们做那样好的军鞋干啥哩！？”
    “大前年我们妇女上冬学，婆婆也去啦，在这里我才渐渐明白了妇女是受压迫的人，八路军要我们妇女们站起来，摆脱旧社会的束绑，和男人一样平等，一样的工作。从前我可后悔自己不该长成女人！现在这种想法谁也没有了，解放区的妇女都站起来，都自由了，有了很多的权利。”
    “反正听共产党的话，跟共产党走，没有错！”最后她十分认真而肯定的这样说着，望着挂在正壁上的毛主席像。
    “现在蒋介石飞到新乡！你知道吗？”韩主任的妻子问她。
    “昨天我们妇女上课就知道啦，我们不怕他进攻，去年，娘家兄弟被顽固派打死啦，可是现在我娘家还有三个侄儿和我兄弟的儿子，都参加了咱们的野战部队，他们要替他爸爸叔叔报仇，侄儿们知道他的爸爸叔叔们是怎样死掉的！”好象有种压制不住的愤慨使他不能不继续说下去。
    “我虽是个女人，但在反顽固这一份上，我也要尽我的力量，现在我正要找韩主任说一件事，可是这件事………”好象他有了顾虑。
    “啥事？你说吧，没有外人，我负责………”韩主任郑重的说。
    “我和他是俩口，感情也好，本该是一对好夫妻，可是他的行为近来非常不好，我不能容忍他，容忍他就要害了大家，也害了自己！我要告诉政府，我的男人是正和特务勾搭哩！这几天他们鬼鬼祟祟的，总有生人来找他，我问他那是谁，他就不告我！”他的眼望着门外，带着一种回忆的神气，似乎她现在要想完全记起那个生人的模样来。
    “你如果报告了自己的丈夫，将来你们怎样过光景！”韩主任的妻子很惊奇的问她。
    “我对他个人没有私仇，俺二口感情是很好的，现在我也不因这事和他离了婚，可是我要帮助他向政府坦白，我一人不行，大家来帮助，总要让他转变，光景还要和从前一样过，他种地，我纺花。”
    韩主任的妻子呆了，他看着徐爱夏，这个挂着耳坠，而且是个小脚的妇女想着：“大概这就是国民党统治区所谓“不忠实自己丈夫的女人吧！？”假使她现在在国民党统治区，她必定要受到“法律制裁的”。
    真的！女房东的话完全实现了，经过六七天的帮助与劝导，在五月二十六日晚上，黄须村召开了个挽救徐爱夏丈夫的自新大会，会议上徐爱夏努力劝着自己的丈夫向大家坦白。
    “你告大家说，你这几天是忙个啥来！那个特务头子在那里？谁来勾搭你？”他替丈夫燃起了一支烟，和丈夫并坐在一起。丈夫低着头，红着脸，吸着烟，吞吞吐吐的回答着。
    “我是一个上当的，那个人………”
    “……………………。”
    劳累了一天的老乡们，在灯光下欢笑着，妇女们以喜悦的眼光看着徐爱夏。
    “应该这样子！徐爱夏做的对！”群众们一致这样的高呼！
    （注）受——就是下地做庄稼活的意思。
        一九四六年五月二十九于黄须村
