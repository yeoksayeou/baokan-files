    各解放区纷纷电慰潘师
    【新华社延安十日电】国民党军一八四师师长潘朔端将军、副师长郑祖志将军率全师官兵海城起义消息传至各解放区后，各界人士咸极钦佩，纷纷驰电慰问。晋冀鲁豫军区司令员刘伯承将军、政委邓小平将军曾代表全军电贺（文略，见十日本报）。新四军军长兼山东军区司令员阵毅将军率全体指战员致贺称：“贵师将士深明大义，高举义旗，拒绝参加屠杀人民的内战，足见真理所在，民心所向。当民主巨浪奔腾全球，逆流终必自毁，希加紧为和平民主努力，加强与人民团结，为独立自由民主与富强的新中国而奋斗！”山东参议会代表山东三千八百万人民表示热烈欢迎，并誓为后盾，保卫和平民主。总工会等四十个团体电称：贵师的明哲义举，大大挫折了国内法西斯好战分子的凶焰，必定获得全国人民的拥护与国民党军内广大被骗被迫进行内战官兵的同情。晋绥边区各界联合会电称：你们的义举是光荣的，你们的呼声定将得到全国人民热烈的拥护和支援，你们的光荣起义，是一个警告，警告被反动派驱使到东北屠杀人民的国民党军队中不少富有正义感的官兵。你们的光荣又是一个打击，打击反动派欺骗自己的官兵，为其私人目的而作无谓牺牲的卑劣行为。你们的光荣起义，也是一个号召，号召被反动派强迫进行内战的国民党军官兵和你们一样站在人民方面来。你们的光荣起义，更是一个说明，它说明了反对内战，争取和平的民主洪流是不可抗拒的。晋察冀边区暨张市职工会、农会、青联会、妇联会、回建会、文联会等，亦以高度的热情和振奋，向一八四师敬致慰问。
