Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd: TASS, Moscow, 22nd: A diplomatic observer for the Red Star newspaper pointed out that the continued U.S. provision of armed assistance to the Kuomintang is one of the reasons for the expansion of the Chinese civil war. The observer stated that the internal armed struggle in China has not diminished, which is causing increasing anxiety among progressive public opinion worldwide. The observer further pointed out that despite armed conflicts between the Kuomintang army and the People's Revolutionary Army, the Chinese Communist Party still adheres to its position of unconditional ceasefire. The observer strongly asserted that the United States, disregarding the insistent and reasonable demands of non-interference in China's internal affairs and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, is providing military assistance to the Kuomintang on an even larger scale than in the past. According to a United Press report, Lieutenant General Gillem even announced that U.S. Army and Navy officers and soldiers will remain stationed in China until the end of 1946. After pointing out that the U.S. military aid to China bill has been submitted to Congress, the observer emphasized that according to press reports, the United States intends to participate in the training of one million Chinese troops. The observer strongly asserted that the various actions of the United States have not only aroused dissatisfaction from the Chinese people, who demand that the United States stop interfering in China's internal affairs, but have also aroused dissatisfaction from progressive people in the United States.

    美国帮助扩大中国内战  中外进步舆论咸表不满
    【新华社延安二十三日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十二日电：红星报外交观察家指责：美国继续难予国民党武装援助，是使中国内战展开的原因之一。该观察家称：中国内部武装斗争并未减，这引起了全世界进步舆论愈来愈大的焦急。观察家继指出：尽管国民党军队与人民革命军之间，发生武装冲突，但中共仍坚持无条件停战的立场。观察家力称：美国不顾不干涉中国内政和美军撤出中国的坚持而合理的要求，而在较过去更大的规模上，予国民党以军事援助。据合众社报导：吉愉中将竟公告美陆海军官兵将留驻中国，真至一九四六年年底为止。观察家在指出美军事援华法案已向国会提出一事后，复强调指出：据报界消息，美国意欲参加一百万中国军队的调练事宜。观察家力称：美国方面的种种行动，不仅引起了要求美国停止干涉中国内政中国人民的方面的不满，而且也引起了美国进步人士的不满。
