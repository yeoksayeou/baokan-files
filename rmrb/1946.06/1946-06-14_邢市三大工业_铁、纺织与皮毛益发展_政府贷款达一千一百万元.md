    Iron, Textile, and Leather Flourish
    Government Loans Reach 11 Million Yuan
    [Xing City News] Under the support of our democratic government, Xing City's three major industries—iron, textiles, and leather—have rapidly developed. Before the war, there were three iron factories; during the enemy occupation, there were fifteen; now, the number has increased to eighteen, employing a total of 186 managers and workers, with a total capital of 8.75 million yuan. Each month, they can produce 42 manual cotton carding bows, 32 powered bows, and 30,000 jin of farm tools. Before the war, there were twelve textile factories; after the enemy occupation, machines were confiscated, and workers lost their jobs. Now, the number has grown to eighteen, employing a total of 105 managers and workers, with a capital of over 2.4 million yuan. They have 23 towel weaving machines, 26 sock knitting machines, 8 wide cloth weaving machines, and 7 iron-wheeled weaving machines. Daily production includes 75 dozens of towels, 26 dozens of socks, 12.4 zhang of wide cloth, and 22 zhang of iron machine cloth. The number of people engaged in drawing thread, sewing socks, and spinning cotton reaches 208 daily. There are eleven households engaged in family textile production, with 28 people, and a capital of over 1.6 million yuan. Daily production includes 5 dozens of towels, 10.5 dozens of socks, and 4 zhang of wide cloth. There are a total of 165 raw and processed leather shops and workshops, with over 3,200 workers and partners. After the enemy occupation, they were all destroyed, and workers lost their jobs. Currently, 38 raw and processed leather shops have resumed operations. Twenty workshops are about to open, employing 86 workers, with a capital of 1.31 million yuan. The government has already issued loans of 2.74 million yuan to the iron and textile industries and will provide 8.55 million yuan in two phases to help the leather industry recover and develop.
