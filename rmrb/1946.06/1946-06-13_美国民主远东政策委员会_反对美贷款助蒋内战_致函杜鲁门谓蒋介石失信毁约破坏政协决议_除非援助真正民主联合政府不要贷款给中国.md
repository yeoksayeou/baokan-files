Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 10th. Regarding the loan of 500 million yuan to China, the American Democratic Far Eastern Policy Committee sent a letter to President Truman in mid-May, believing that a loan at this time would facilitate the civil war. The main points of the letter are as follows: "In the President's statement of December 15th regarding US policy toward China, it was stated that the United States would only provide assistance if the National Government moved toward peace and unity. Credit loans could only be paid if the goal was to make China's economy soundly developed and Sino-US trade prosperous. Mr. President, these conditions do not exist in China today. It would be naive to think that the ruling class of the Kuomintang would welcome the expansion of the government's base. In the past few weeks, there have been many events that sufficiently illustrate that the Kuomintang right wing will use any means to maintain its own self-interest and resist the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. General Chiang Kai-shek himself has a long history of breaking faith and violating agreements. Chiang Kai-shek can agree in principle to general discussions of a united government, but as soon as he has to negotiate the specific implementation of the agreement with representatives of other parties and establish a new government, Chiang immediately goes back on his word. Without the encouragement of American loans to aid China's finances, Chiang Kai-shek would not have changed his attitude so easily. Due to this situation, we implore you not to loan to China unless you aid a truly democratic united government. China welcomes loans to revive the country, but it should also know deeply that if any loans are allowed before the current dictatorship is abolished, every minute will financially support the conspiracy of civil war. In the eyes of the people, there is no doubt that democratic forces will win the final victory. The civil war in China has caused us to lose a lot of prestige in the Far East. If the United States becomes a tool of civil war, the Chinese people's friendship with the United States will inevitably be replaced by hatred. This committee believes that it represents the vast majority of the Chinese and American people in asking you to take all these actions. Therefore, please clearly restate and immediately implement the statement of December 15th, that no loans will be made to China unless there is a peaceful agreement between all parties to complete the democratic reorganization of the government." The letter was signed by the chairman of the committee, S. L. Fleshar.

    美国民主远东政策委员会
    反对美贷款助蒋内战
    致函杜鲁门谓蒋介石失信毁约破坏政协决议
    除非援助真正民主联合政府不要贷款给中国
    【新华社延安十日电】美国民主远东政策委员会对贷款五亿元与中国事，于上月中旬曾致函杜鲁门总统，认为如此时贷款，适成为促成内战的借款。其函文要点如下：“总统曾于十二月十五日关于美对华政策的声明中，曾谓：美国只在国民政府趋向和平与团结的情况下，方予以援助。信用借款仅在目标为使全中国经济健全发展，及中美贸易兴盛这一合理的条件下，才能贷付。总统先生，此等条件并不存在于今日之中国，设想国民党统治阶层会欢迎扩大政府的基础，未免过于天真。过去几星期来，已有不少事件，足以说明国民党右翼将不择手段，以维持一己私利，抵制政协决议。蒋介石将军本人长期失信毁约，对于联合政府的泛泛讨论，蒋介石可以在原则上予以同意，但一至要和其他党派代表一起谈判协议的具体实行，并建立新政府时，蒋即立刻自食其言。如没有美国贷款援助中国财政的鼓励，蒋介石将不至如此轻易改变他的态度。由于这种情形，我们恳请你，除非援助一真正民主的联合政府，不要贷款给中国。中国固欢迎复兴国家的贷款，但同时也应深知如在现在独裁统治未取消前允许任何贷款，每一分钟都将在财政上支援内战的阴谋。在人民心目中，无疑的民主力量将获最后胜利。中国的内战，已使我们在远东丧失了不少威望。如美国成为内战之工具，则中国人民对美之友谊必为憎恨所代替。本委员会相信是代表极大多数的中美人民来请阁下采取这一切行动，因此请阁下明确的重述并立即实行十二月十五日的声明，除非有各党派和平协议，完成民主的改组政府，将不能贷款给中国”。此信由该会理事长ｓ．ｌ．弗莱撒尔签名。
