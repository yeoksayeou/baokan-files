    Close Military-Civilian Relations, Increased Awareness of Soldiers
    Wenshang Brigade Actively Participates in Mass Movement
    Second Military Sub-district of Jilu Yu Issues Circular Commending

    [Report from our Heze correspondent] The Wenshang County Brigade of the Second Military Sub-district, in response to the call to concentrate forces to mobilize the masses, conducted in-depth mobilization among soldiers and cadres, inspiring their enthusiasm and confidence in participating in the mass movement. A part of the Second Company was immediately assigned to Liuwu District to carry out work, jointly organizing the masses in more than ten villages including Xiaolou and Beiquangou, launching seventy-six struggles against corruption and local tyrants. In particular, the Fourth Platoon of the Second Company, led by Comrade Zhang Xihe (platoon leader), organized mass struggles in three villages including He Village in three days. The soldiers' morale was very high. They themselves said, "In the mass struggle, we changed our thinking of looking down on local comrades." A soldier and Comrade Chen from the joint association said, "We used to think that the joint association did nothing but eat public grain. Now we know that mobilizing the masses is not easy and we have to learn from you." Through this work, military-civilian relations became even closer. In order to give play to this exemplary role of the army participating in the mass movement, the Second Military Sub-district specially issued a circular commending them, pointing out that the Wenshang Basic Brigade's leadership in the masses' struggle to turn over a new leaf not only further strengthened the military-civilian relationship, but also enhanced the soldiers' awareness from practice and gave play to the fine qualities of the people's army. All troops should learn this spirit of serving the people. The Jilu Yu Daily also published a short commentary calling on the Eighth Route Army and local armed forces in the border area to learn from the Wenshang Brigade.

    冀鲁豫二军分区通令表扬
    【本报荷泽讯】二军分区汶上县大队，为响应集中力量发动群众的号召，在战士干部中进行了深入的动员，启发他们参加群运的热情与信心。二连一部，当即分配刘五区进行工作，联合组织了小楼、北泉沟等十余村庄的群众，开展了七六个反贪污反恶霸斗争。特别是二连四班，由张西合同志（班长）带领，三天组织了何庄等三个村的群众斗争，战士情绪很高，他们自己说：“在群众斗争中，改变了我们看不起地方同志的思想”。战士和联合会的陈同志说：“我们过去认为联合会没事光吃公粮，现在可知道发动群众工作不容易了，还得很好的向你们学习。”经过这段工作军民关系更加密切了。为发挥这种军队参加群运的模范作用，第二军分区特通令表扬，指出汶上基干大队领导群众进行翻身斗争，不仅进一步密切了军民的关系，且从实践中提高了战士的觉悟，发挥了人民军队的优良品质。各个部队应学习这种为人民服务的精神。冀鲁豫日报亦发表短论，号召边区的八路军和地方武装向汶上大队学习。
