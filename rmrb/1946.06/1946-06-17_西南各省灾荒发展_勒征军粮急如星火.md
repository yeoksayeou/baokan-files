Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th. The famine in the southwestern provinces continues to develop. The percentage of waterlogged counties in Guangdong Province has reached over 82%; Guizhou Province, over 66%; Sichuan Province, over 80%; and the rice-producing areas of Guizhou Province have also suffered from drought. Regarding the disaster situation in Guangdong Province, the Shanghai Wenhui Daily reported on the 25th of last month that the representatives from the province petitioning in Beijing stated: According to statistics, out of the 97 counties in Guangdong Province, over 80 counties have reported disasters. In the Chaoshan area, more than a thousand people die every day, and in Guangzhou City, at least 600 people starve to death. Usually, there are 100 to 200 corpses found on the streets every day. Tragedies also occur from time to time when starving people搶領 (qiǎng lǐng) or vie for meager relief. According to the same day's report in the same newspaper, overseas Chinese in Siam transported rice to Guangdong to relieve the disaster. On the 3rd of last month, relief was distributed in a theater, and when starving people搶先 (qiǎng xiān) or rushed to receive rice, the police wielded guns and bayonets, causing the starving people to surge back, resulting in more than a dozen deaths and injuries. The disaster victims deeply resent the official relief work in the province. According to a Guangzhou correspondent for the Guangxi Daily, on April 9th, more than 800 refugees in Guangzhou held a demonstration in front of the relief sub-office, shouting, "Give us all the flour and clothing we are entitled to!" and tearing down the sign of the office. Regarding the disaster situation in Guizhou Province, according to Guizhou News: 66 out of the 99 counties in the province have suffered disasters. According to the Southwest Daily on the 23rd of last month, Huang Ronghua, the director of the relief sub-office in the province, telegraphed the Nanjing headquarters, stating: "Thousands of starving people are surrounding the office to petition. Fortunately, nothing happened. Please transport more grain for relief, otherwise, please transport three million coffins. Presented crying in telegraph, a capital crime! A capital crime!" Regarding the disaster situation in Sichuan, according to the Yu Xinhua Daily: The severity of the spring famine in Sichuan, according to the people in the countryside, is unprecedented in the past ten years. Out of the more than 140 counties in Sichuan, 116 counties have suffered from spring drought. In the severely affected areas, there is no harvest at all, and in the lightly affected areas, only 20% to 30% is harvested. In some counties, the drought has not ended, but the collection of overdue grain and the forced requisition of military grain are as urgent as a raging fire. According to a Central News Agency dispatch on April 27th, the Kuomintang authorities decided to transport two million shi of grain from Sichuan to various places in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Regarding the disaster situation in Guizhou, according to the Yu Xinhua Daily, in the ten or more counties in northern Guizhou, such as Zunyi, Chishui, and Zhengan, which produce more rice, the wheat harvest this spring was less than a quarter due to the severe drought, and the fields were cracked, making it impossible to plant rice. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Chongqing on May 28th, there is also talk of transporting grain from Guizhou to Hunan.
