　　Implement the New Policy of Labor-Management Cooperation to Develop Industry
    The General Labor Union Enlarged Executive Committee Concludes
    Ji Degui, Zhao Guoqiang, and Others Elected as Standing Committee Members
    [This newspaper reports] The Second Enlarged Executive Committee Meeting of the General Labor Union, which determined the new direction of the workers' movement in the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, victoriously concluded on the 20th after thirteen days. The major achievement of this conference was the ideological acceptance of the new policy of the labor movement: "Mutual benefit for both public and private sectors, labor-management cooperation, and development of production." Based on this spirit, historically significant conference resolutions and declarations were formulated. The 35 executive committee members present and the 37 representatives selected from the newly liberated areas studied and discussed in groups and categories, combining the actual situation of the labor movement in their respective regions, based on Deputy Political Commissar Bo's report on the new policy of the labor movement. On the 14th, typical reports began, proving from the summary of experiences that Chairman Mao's policy is the only correct policy. For example, since the establishment of Yishengcheng Factory in Changzhi last November, the public invested 160,000, while workers and private capitalists invested 230,000. Because the factory management promoted democracy, appropriately improved the lives of workers, and fully cooperated with workers, all production and wage issues were discussed and decided jointly by the factory management and the workers. The workers had a sense of ownership, so they understood the difficulties of the factory management and jointly agreed with the factory management that each person's monthly wage (including food) would be 700 yuan. Through the joint efforts of labor and management to improve production content and increase productivity, the results were very profitable. The factory's capital has now accumulated to 2 million yuan. The factory management also continues to increase wages for workers. In addition to providing meals, it has increased to 1,700 yuan per person per month. Productivity continues to increase, and the factory management also maintains consistently high profits. The typical reports concluded on the 16th. From the 17th to the 19th, the conference resolutions and declarations were solemnly discussed and passed. As the conference progressed to the 20th, Comrade Zhao Guoqiang, on behalf of the attending executive committee members and representatives, announced the acceptance of the suggestion made by worker senator Yuan Zhihe: "From now on, union cadres should check their work once a week in the spirit of the conference resolutions to implement the policy instructed by Chairman Mao, as an addendum to the resolutions." On the same day, the attending executive committee members formally elected Ji Degui, Zhao Guoqiang, Mao Qihua, Su Qun, Zhang Zhengyan, Du Daozhou, and Li Xian as the next standing committee members, and Li Dexin and Wang Ji as alternate standing committee members.
