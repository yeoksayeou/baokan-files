Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Rome, 11th: Italian Republicans are enthusiastically celebrating the establishment of the Italian Republic. Republicans are also holding demonstrations in various parts of northern Italy and Rome to oppose the increasingly rampant illegal activities of the royalists. On the 11th, Republican demonstrators in Rome clashed with royalist demonstrators, resulting in multiple injuries. In Naples, police repelled royalists attempting to destroy the Italian Communist Party headquarters, killing four and injuring forty-five. In Venice, police seized the tricolor flag from royalist protesters. Another report: The Italian cabinet met on the 13th to discuss Umberto's refusal to abdicate. Umberto denounces the voting as "improper" and refuses to hand over the government to the cabinet. It is reported that the guards around the perimeter of the Quirinal Palace in Rome have been completely withdrawn. This action indicates that the Italian cabinet does not recognize Umberto's status.
