    Yan Xishan Launches Large-Scale Invasion of the Jinzhong Liberated Area
    General He Long Issues Warning
    If You Do Not Withdraw from Occupied Areas, I Will Resolutely Counterattack
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 13th] Regarding Yan Xishan's continued dispatch of troops and the re-employment of Japanese and puppet troops to launch a large-scale invasion of the Jinzhong Plain liberated area, He Long, Commander of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin Sui Joint Defense, issued the following statement: After the Yan-Japanese-puppet allied forces "mopped up" and "nibbled" at our Qing (Yuan), Tai (Yuan), and Xu (Gou) liberated areas, they continued to increase troops from both the north and south to the Jinzhong Plain. Since the 6th of this month, they have launched a large-scale invasion of our Wen (Shui) and Jiao (Cheng) liberated areas. The mobilized force numbers, as confirmed by documents seized by our side, include: parts of the Yan army's 71st Division, 49th Division, 46th Division, 44th Division, and 37th Division, totaling five regiments, and one column completely reorganized from puppet troops, as well as hundreds of Japanese soldiers, accompanied by two tanks and three armored vehicles. They have already occupied more than 20 villages and towns, including Xishe, Dongshe, Beishe, Dongnanshe, Chengzihqian, Hujiabao, Changfeng, Wangmingzhai, Anbeizhuang, Shihouzhen, Henggou, Dongxicheng Village, and Nanzhuangzhen. Liu Xiaozeng's 70th Division in southern Fenyang has also been fiercely attacking the liberated area west of Fenyang city for days, and even used poison gas against our defending troops when the attack on Beikuo Village was frustrated. Since the ceasefire order, the Yan army has never ceased its attacks, disturbances, and looting against our liberated areas. We have repeatedly issued warnings and telegraphed the Taiyuan Executive Group and the Beiping Executive Headquarters to stop them, but to no avail. Now, the flames of civil war have spread throughout the Jinzhong Plain. If they are not quickly extinguished, they will continue to spread. We are issuing a final warning to the Shanxi reactionaries. Our tolerance has reached its limit. If they do not pull back from the brink, immediately stop the offensive, and withdraw from the occupied areas, we will resolutely counterattack in order to protect the lives, property, and land security of the people in the border area, defend the people's democratic rights, and prevent the continued expansion of the civil war. Yan Xishan's side will be fully responsible for any serious consequences arising therefrom.

    阎锡山大举进犯晋中解放区
    贺龙将军提出警告
    如不撤出侵占地区我将坚决实行反击
    【新华社兴县十三日电】对阎锡山继续调遣军队，并重用日伪军大举进犯晋中平川解放区的内战行为，陕甘宁晋绥联防司令员贺龙将军，特发表如下声明：阎日伪联军于“扫荡”、“蚕食”我清（源）太（原）徐（沟）解放区后，继续由南北两面向晋中平川增调军队。自本月六日起，复向我文（水）交（城）解放区大举进犯，其动员兵力番号，据我方缴获之文件查明证实者，计有：阎军七十一师、四十九师、四十六师、四十四师、三十七师各一部共五个团，和完全由伪军改编之一个纵队及日军数百人，并附坦克车二辆、装甲车三辆。已占我西社、东社、北社、东南社、城子前、胡家堡、常丰、王明寨、安北庄、石候镇、横沟、东西城村、南庄镇等村镇二十余处。汾阳南部七十师刘效增部，亦连日向汾阳城西解放区猛犯，并在进攻北廓村受挫时，竟对我守军施放毒气。自停战命令迄今，阎军从未停止向我解放区之进攻、出扰、打劫，我方曾屡次提出警告，并电太原执行小组和北平执行部以制止，迄无效果。现予内战炮火已燃遍晋中平川，若不迅速扑灭，势将继续蔓延。我们最后一次向山西反动派警告，我方容忍已至最大限度，如果还不悬崖勒马，立即停止进攻，并撤出侵占地区，我方为保护边区人民之生命、财产、土地之安全，保卫人民的民主权利，并防止内战继续扩大起见，定将坚决实行反击，因此而招之任何严重后果，当全由阎锡山方面负责。
