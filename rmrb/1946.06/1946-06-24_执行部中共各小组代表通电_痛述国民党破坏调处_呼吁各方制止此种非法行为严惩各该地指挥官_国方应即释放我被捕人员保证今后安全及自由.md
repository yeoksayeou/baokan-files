Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Representatives of the Communist Party groups in the Executive Headquarters have been subjected to beatings and insults by the Kuomintang garrison in the Kuomintang areas, and even arrested and gone missing, with no guarantee of work and personal safety. They have now jointly issued a circular telegram as follows:

To: Mr. Peason, Mr. Ye Jianying, Mr. Zheng Jiemin, members of the Beiping Executive Headquarters; General Bai Lude Jiang Jun, General Tian Bomen; Marshal Marshall, General Zhou Enlai, General Xu Yongchang of the Nanjing Three-Man Group; All Representatives of the Nanjing Political Consultative Conference, All Newspapers and Legal Entities Nationwide:

Since the establishment of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, the representatives of the Communist Party groups have not shied away from difficulties and dangers, and have been running around for mediation. For several months, they have dared not slacken. They were delighted to do their best to lay the cornerstone of peace, hoping to treat each other with sincerity and eliminate the estrangement between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. However, things have turned out unexpectedly. Under the instruction of warmongers, the government garrisons in various places have deliberately sabotaged mediation, repeatedly threatening the lives, safety, and personal freedom of the Communist Party group personnel. To cite only the most obvious examples, on February 20th, at Zaoyuan Temple Station, Wang Baoyu, a major of our Jinan group, was arrested and has been missing since then. On April 10th, Lin Zhaonan, an interpreter of our Shijiazhuang group, was detained and deprived of food for five days, on the verge of death. On April 16th, Colonel Wu Kejiu, a representative of our Gaomi group, was shelled, resulting in deafness in his right ear, and interpreter Wang Yue was injured. On May 20th, Xin Guanwu, an agent of our Gaomi group, was arrested at Caijiazhuang Station, and his life and death are still unknown. On May 3rd, Colonel Fu Jize, a representative of our Botou group, was insulted. On May 21st, Colonel Gan Chongdou, a representative of our Zaozhuang group, and interpreter Wu Jihan were beaten and injured. Colonel Gan was on the verge of death, his tendons and bones were broken, and he became disabled. The life and death of interpreter Wu is still unknown. On June 11th, Colonel Mi Yong, a representative of our Yancheng group, and all group members were detained, and the situation is still unclear. On June 10th, Lieutenant Colonel Ni Shiliang, a representative of our Group 24, was publicly insulted in Suxian County. On June 9th, the American representative of the Jinan group notified Mr. Kuang Rennong, our representative, that the Jinan authorities had ordered all Communist Party personnel in the group not to go out and forcibly confiscated our radio station. On the same day, the government proposed that four members of our group, Liu Liqing and others, be sent back to the Communist Party area by the government, and refused our group's responsible comrades to escort them. Where are Liu Jiqing and the other three people? Their whereabouts are still unknown. Other detentions, inspections, criticisms, and surveillance in various places are too numerous to mention. In particular, Major Wang Baoyu, Lieutenant Colonel Xin Guanwu, Colonel Mi Yong, and all members of the Yancheng group have not received any news. It is doubtful whether they have been killed. All of this not only fails to guarantee the safety of the representatives, but also undermines the achievements of peace and makes the mediation work impossible. Moreover, the stations of the groups are all under the jurisdiction of the government. If this kind of behavior is not eliminated for a day, the peace cause cannot be carried out. For this reason, we propose: (1) Immediately release our arrested group personnel. (2) The government must absolutely guarantee the safety and freedom of our group personnel in the future. (3) Severely punish the responsible commanders of the local government army. (4) The highest responsible person of the government should publicly apologize to us and compensate for the losses. (5) The government should be fully responsible for our group's arrested and victims. (6) Unseal the radio station of our Jinan group. (7) The above items shall be issued in a joint announcement by the Executive Headquarters. The above seven items are urgently requested to be properly handled as soon as possible to ensure the rapid progress of the mediation work, and we hope that people from all walks of life will safeguard personal freedom, strive for the early realization of peace and democracy, and urge the government to implement the Four Promises and the Three Major Agreements, which will not only be a blessing for the three parties' mediation personnel, but also a great blessing for the whole country. We are anxiously awaiting your orders.

Communist Party Group Representatives: Wang Zaixing, Major of the First Group of Jining; Xiang Zhonghua, Colonel of the Second Group of Chifeng; Chen Geng, Major General of the Third Group of Taiyuan; Wei Guoqing, Major General of the Fourth Group of Xuzhou; Zhao Erlu, Major General of the Fifth Group of Zhangjiakou; Liu Jianxun, Colonel of the Sixth Group of Qinxian; Kuang Qiannong, Major General of the Seventh Group of Jinan; Fang Fang, Major General of the Eighth Group of Guangzhou; Xue Zizheng, Colonel of the Ninth Group of Hankou; Huang Zhen, Major General of the Tenth Group of Xinxiang; Duan Suquan, Major General of the Eleventh Group of Chengde; Tao Xijin, Major General of the Twelfth Group of Shijiazhuang; Li Bo, Colonel of the Thirteenth Group of Datong; Zhang Ziqiang, Colonel of the Fourteenth Group of Linyi; Fu Hao, Colonel of the Fifteenth Group of Dezhou; Hua Cheng, Lieutenant Colonel of the Sixteenth Group of Taian; Han Nianlong, Colonel of the Seventeenth Group of Huaiyin; Fu Jize, Colonel of the Eighteenth Group of Botou; Lei Renmin, Colonel of the Nineteenth Group of Anyang; Lin Zi'an, Colonel of the Twentieth Group of Nankou; Wu Kejiu, Colonel of the Twenty-First Group of Gaoshan; Lu Weibin, Colonel of the Twenty-Second Group of Zaozhuang; Wang Shaoyong, Major General of the Twenty-Fourth Group of Xuzhou; Zhang Wenyu, Colonel of the Twenty-Fifth Group of Anci; Li Yimin, Colonel of the Twenty-Sixth Group of Chaoyang; Rao Shushi, Lieutenant General of the Twenty-Seventh Group of Shenyang; Geng Biao, Major General of the Twenty-Eighth Group of Sipingjie; Xu Guangda, Major General of the Twenty-Ninth Group of Benxi; Zhang Jingwu, Major General of the Thirtieth Group; Wang Yumin, Colonel of the Thirty-First Group of Yongnian; Ren Shishun, Lieutenant Colonel of the Thirty-Second Group of Guangshan.

Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 20th: Regarding the death of Liaison Officer Lei Fenqiang of the Yancheng Group from a bullet, the spokesperson of the Shandong Military Region said: "According to the reports we have received, the puppet troops reorganized by the Kuomintang in Yancheng were on the train taken by the Yancheng Group on the evening of the 10th. At a place ten miles east of Yancheng, they were attacked by our troops protecting the wheat harvest near the railway. When the battle was fierce, the Yancheng Group heard the news and sent Kuomintang Liaison Officer Lei Fenqiang and Communist Party Liaison Officer Liu Xiuren to mediate by car. Unfortunately, Mr. Lei was killed by a stray bullet, and Mr. Liu was also injured at the same time. After the incident, our Bohai Military Region expressed deep regret for the sacrifice and injury of Liaison Officers Lei and Liu for peace, and informed Mi Yong, the Communist Party representative of the Yancheng Group, of our condolences to Mr. Lei's family. Unexpectedly, the Nationalist side did not make a fair handling based on the facts, and illegally detained the Communist Party representative and all members of the group after the Yancheng Group returned to Jinan. At the same time, the Central News Agency reported that Mr. Lei was killed by a stray bullet, and insisted that he was killed by the Communist Party troops. Regarding the injury of Communist Party Liaison Officer Liu Xiuren, they did not mention a word, and fabricated rumors saying that Communist Party Representative Liu Xiuren jumped on the car and his whereabouts were unknown, in order to cover up their illegal detention of Communist Party representatives. The spokesperson of the Shandong Military Region said: We have telegraphed the Beiping Executive Headquarters regarding the sacrifice of Mr. Lei Fenqiang and the injury of Mr. Liu Xiuren of the Yancheng Group, requesting them to handle the matter. Regardless of who is responsible, we will seek a proper solution based on the principle of seeking truth from facts. We hope that the Jinan Nationalist military and political authorities will consider the overall situation and seek a reasonable solution. Immediately restore the freedom of the Communist Party personnel of the Jinan Group and ensure the safety of the Communist Party personnel of the Yancheng Group."

    【新华社延安二十一电】执行部中共各小组代表，在国民党地区横遭国民党驻军殴辱，甚至逮捕失踪，工作及生命安全毫无保障。顷联名发出通电如下：
    北平执行部队伯森委员、叶剑英委员、郑介民委员、白鲁德蒋军、田博门将军，南京三人小组马歇尔元帅、周恩来将军、徐永昌将军钧凿；南京政协会诸代表、全国各报社、各法团均鉴：
    溯自军事调处执行部成立以来，中共各小组代表不避艰险，奔走调停，数月于兹，未敢稍懈，方欣竭尽全力，奠定和平之基石，庶几推诚相与，消除国共之隔阂。乃事有出人意料之外者，政府各地驻军，在好战分子指使下，蓄意破坏调处，迭次威胁中共小组人员之生命安全及身体自由。仅举其荦荦大者，如二月二十日在枣园寺车站，捕去我济南小组组员王保愚少校，至今下落不明。四月十日，禁扣我石家庄小组翻译林兆南，五天未予饭食，奄奄待毙。四月十六日，炮击我高密小组代表武可久上校，以致右耳失聪，翻译王越受伤。五月二十日，在蔡家庄车站捕去我高密小组代理人辛冠五，至今死生未卜。五月三日，侮辱我泊头小组代表傅继泽上校。五月二十一日，殴伤我枣庄代表甘重斗上校，及译员吴记汉，甘上校几频于死，筋骨折断，成为残废，吴译员亦至今未明生死。六月十一日，拘捕我晏城小组代表糜镛上校及全体组员，至今情况不明。六月十日，在宿县公开侮辱二十四小组我小组代表倪士良中校。六月九日，济南小组美方代表通知我方代表邝任农，曾转达济南当局命所有小组中共人员一律不准外出，且强迫没收我方电台。同日，政府提出将小组我方人员刘李清等四人，由政府负责送回中共地区，并拒绝我方小组负责同志护送，刘季清等四人，究至何处，迄今下落不明。其他各地扣留、检查、非难、监视，更屈指难数。尤以王保愚少校、辛冠五中校与糜镛上校，及晏城小组全体组员，现在均未获有任何消息，是否遇害，实堪疑虑。如此种种，不仅各代表生命安全无保障，抑且破坏和平之成果，使调处工作无法进行，况各小组驻地均在政府辖属，此种行为一日不除，和平事业即无从进行。为此提出：（一）立即释放我方被捕小组人员。（二）政府方面今后绝对保障我小组人员之生命安全及自由。（三）严惩当地政府军负责指挥官。（四）政府最高负责人向我公开道歉，并赔偿损失。（五）我方小组被捕及遇害者，政府应完全负责。（六）解封济南小组我方电台。（七）以上各项由执行部发布联合公告。以上七项，恳请早日予以适当处理，保证调处工作得以迅速进行，并望社会人士为保障人身自由，争取和平民主早日实现，督促政府实行四项诺言及三大协定，则不仅为三方调处人员之福，抑即为全国之大幸也。临电不胜迫切待命之至。
    中共小组代表集宁第一小组王再兴少校，赤峰第二小组向仲华上校，太原第三小组陈赓少将，徐州第四小组韦国清少将，张家口第五小组赵尔陆少将，沁县第六小组刘建勋上校，济南第七小组邝仟农少将，广州第八小组方方少将，汉口第九小组薛子正上校，新乡第十小组黄镇少将，承德第十一小组段苏权少将，石家庄第十二小组陶希晋少将，大同第十三小组李波上校，临沂第十四小组张子强上校，德州第十五小组符浩上校，泰安第十六小组华诚中校，淮阴第十七小组韩念龙上校，泊头第十八小组傅继泽上校，安阳第十九小组雷任民上校，南口第二十小组蔺子安上校，高山第二十一小组武可久上校，枣庄第二十二小组陆渭斌上校，徐州第二十四小组王少镛少将，安次第二十五小组张温钰上校，朝阳第二十六小组李逸民上校，沈阳第二十七小组饶漱石中将，四平街第二十八小组耿飚少将，本溪第二十九小组许光达少将，三十小组张经武少将，永年第三十一小组王育民上校，光山第三十二小组任士舜中校。
    【新华社临沂二十日电】关于晏城小组雷奋强联络官中弹殒命一事，山东军区发言人称：“据吾人所得之报告，晏城国民党收编之伪军，于十日黄昏乘晏城小组所乘之火车，在晏城东十里处被我铁道附近保卫麦收之部队攻击，战斗正激烈时，晏城小组闻讯，乃派国方联络官雷奋强与中共联络官刘秀仁二人乘车前往调解，雷氏不幸中流弹牺牲，刘氏亦同时受伤。在事件发生后，我渤海军区对雷、刘两联络官为和平牺牲及受伤，深表遗憾，并曾电告晏城小组中共代表糜镛对雷氏家属悼唁。不料国方不根据事实作公平处理，竟在晏城小组返济后，将中共代表及全体组员非法扣留。与此同时，中央社报导将雷氏流弹牺牲，一口咬定为中共部队杀害，对于中共联络官刘秀仁负伤一事，只字不提，并捏造谣言，说中共代表刘秀仁跳上车不知去向，以掩饰其扣留中共代表之非法行为。山东军区发言人称：吾人对晏城小组雷奋强氏之牺牲与刘秀仁氏之受伤，电请北平执行部处理，无论责由谁属，在本实事求是原则，寻求妥善办法解决。吾人希望济南国方军政当局，一切为大局设想，求得合理解决。立即恢复济南小组中共人员的自由，保证晏城小组中共人员安全。
