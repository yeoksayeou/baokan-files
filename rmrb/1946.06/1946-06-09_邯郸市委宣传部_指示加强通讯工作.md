    Handan Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department
    Instructs to Strengthen Communication Work
    [This City News] Since the publication of the People's Daily, the city's communication work has achieved considerable success with the help of comrades from the newspaper office and the efforts of comrades who love writing. The established communication organizations include the central group, the Municipal Government and the Municipal National Salvation Association, the People's Education Center, the South Guan District National Salvation Association, the South City District National Salvation Association, and the Chengli Police Station of the Public Security Bureau. In addition, there are individual correspondents from agencies such as the Suburban District, middle schools, the Public Security Bureau, and the North City District National Salvation Association. A total of 40 correspondents have been developed, and more than 30 articles were written in May. Some correspondents are very enthusiastic about writing, such as Comrade Fu Xiang from the Public Security Bureau, who wrote several articles alone. Recently, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee issued instructions: (1) The central group has not played its due role in the past. In June, each person should write an article. (2) Some comrades still have a confused idea of ​​underestimating communication work in their thinking. In the future, they should recognize the importance of "the whole party running the newspaper" and regard writing as part of their work. (3) The organization is not yet universal. In the future, individual correspondents should be used as a basis to quickly establish communication organizations and adopt collective creation and research methods. The South City District has recently demonstrated this, and it is worth learning from. (Xiao Fang)

    邯郸市委宣传部
    指示加强通讯工作
    【本市讯】本市的通讯工作，自人民日报发刊后，在报社同志的帮助和爱好写作同志的努力下，收到不少成绩。已建立的通讯组织，除中心小组外，有市政府与市救国会，民众教育馆、南关区救国会、南城区救国会、公安局城里派出所等，此外尚有城郊区、中学、公安局、北城区救国会等机关的个别通讯员，总计通讯员已发展到四十名，五月份共写了三十余篇稿件。有的通讯员写稿情绪很高，如公安局福祥同志一人写了几篇。日前市委宣传部发出指示：（一）中心组过去还没有起到应有的作用，在六月份，每人应写一篇稿子。（二）有些同志在思想上还存在轻视通讯工作的糊涂观念。今后应认识到“全党办报”的重要，把写稿看成工作的一部分。（三）组织方面还不普遍，今后应以已有的个别通讯员为基础，迅速建立起通讯组织，多采用集体创作及研究的方式，最近南城区发挥了这一点，值得学习。（萧方）
