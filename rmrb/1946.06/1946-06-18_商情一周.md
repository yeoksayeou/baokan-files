Market News Weekly
    In various areas of the border region this week, new wheat has begun to enter the market, but grain prices remain stable without a significant drop. This is mainly due to appropriate government regulation. The price of wheat in Handan remains around 25-26 yuan per jin, while new wheat is 24 yuan. In Heze on the 11th, the price of wheat (Shuangguan dou) ranged from a minimum of 390 yuan to a maximum of 440 yuan. In Shexian on the 7th, wheat was priced at 18 yuan per jin. In Yangcheng on the 9th, wheat ranged from 19.2 to 20 yuan per jin, with new wheat at 16 yuan per jin. Cotton and homespun cloth prices are stable. In Handan this week, cotton is priced at 260 yuan per jin, and homespun cloth is 65 yuan per chi. In Heze on the 11th, cotton was priced at 275 yuan per jin, an increase of 5 yuan from the 9th, while homespun cloth was 46 yuan per chi. White market cloth is slightly firmer. In Handan, the price per bolt was 17,300 yuan on the 9th, rising to 19,500 yuan on the 12th, and then falling back to 19,300 yuan on the 14th due to incoming goods from Anyang. Sea salt is expensive, with the price in Handan this week at 60 yuan per person, an increase of 18 yuan from the previous week (6th), mainly due to the blockade by the Kuomintang government. The price of kerosene in Handan has fallen by 30 yuan compared to last week due to abundant supplies from Puyang (from 260 yuan per jin on the 8th to 230 yuan on the 10th). In Jincheng on the 9th, white hemp was 240 yuan per jin, and sesame oil was 190 yuan per jin. In Heze on the 11th, white oil was 90-95 yuan per jin, peanuts were 27 yuan per jin, and boiled green beans were 10,000-12,000 yuan per jin.
    This week's currency exchange rates: In Handan, the listed buying price for legal tender (fabi) was 0.21 yuan, and the selling price was 0.215 yuan. The buying price for Customs Gold Units (Guanjin) was 4.2 yuan, and the selling price was 4.3 yuan, a slight increase from last week, but the general expectation is that the trend is still downward. In Heze, the listed price for legal tender was 0.19 yuan. The price of pure gold in Jincheng fell from 54,000 yuan per tael last week (7th) to 53,000 yuan per tael this week (9th). The price in Handan remained at 53,000 yuan per tael. The volume of pure gold transactions was considerable in all regions. (June 15th)

    商情一周
    本周边区各地，新麦开始上市，但粮价仍然稳定，没有大跌，这主要原因系由于政府适当调济的结果，邯郸麦子每斤价格维持在二十五六元左右，新麦二十四元；荷泽十一日小麦价（双官斗）最低三九○元，最高四四○元。涉县七日小麦每斤价十八元，阳城九日小麦每斤十九元二角到二十元，新麦每斤十六元。棉花土布平稳，邯郸本周棉花价格每斤二六○元，土布每尺六十五元，荷泽十一日棉花价每斤二七五元，比九日上涨五元，土布每尺四十六元；白市布稍挺，邯郸价格每匹在九日是一万七千三百元，到十二日就上涨到一万九千五百元，十四日因安阳来货又回跌到一万九千三百元。海盐价昂，邯郸本周每人六十元，比上周（六日）涨十八元，主要原因由于国民党政府封锁。邯郸煤油价格因濮阳来货畅旺，比上周跌落卅元。（从八日的每斤二六○元跌到十日的二三○元）晋城九日白麻每斤二四○元，香油每斤一九○元。荷泽十一日白油每斤九十元至九十五元，花生每斤二十七元，煮青每斤一万元至一万二千元。
    本周货币行情，邯郸挂牌法币买进二角一分，卖出二角一分五，关金买进四元二角，卖出四元三角，比上周稍涨，但一般估计前途仍是看跌趋势。荷泽法币挂牌价一角九分。赤金价格，晋城每两从上周（七日）的五万四千元下跌到本周（九日）的五万三千元，邯郸价格每两仍然五万三千元，赤金成交各地都不少。（六月十五日）
