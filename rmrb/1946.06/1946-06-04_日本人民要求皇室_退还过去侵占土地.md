    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: Tokyo dispatch: Applications from the Japanese people demanding that the royal family return land seized from them are flooding the Ministry of the Imperial Household. To date, there have been no fewer than several hundred. 17,000 Ainu people of Hokkaido have submitted a petition to the Imperial Household requesting the return of 75,000 mu of land on Hokkaido. This land was "requisitioned" by the Ministry of the Imperial Household during the Meiji era and later converted into farms and horse ranches. Representatives of the Ainu, after arriving in Tokyo, stated that more than half of their people have no land to cultivate, and therefore insist on demanding the return of this land.
