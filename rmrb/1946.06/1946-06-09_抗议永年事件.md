    Protesting the Yongnian Incident

    Following the Kuomintang planes' frenzied bombing of our Dongming military and civilians, on the 6th of this month, the Kuomintang reactionaries created another inhumane bloody incident in the suburbs of Yongnian City. Two Kuomintang fighter planes frantically bombed and strafed, resulting in 33 casualties among our troops and local residents. The people and soldiers in the liberated areas were filled with uncontrollable grief and indignation upon hearing this heartbreaking news.

    The Yongnian puppet troops, heavily surrounded by our liberated area's military and civilians, should have surrendered to our army according to reason and human nature. Unexpectedly, these traitors and bandits, whom "everyone has the right to kill," were regarded as treasures and pampered children by the Kuomintang reactionaries. They sent planes every day to supply them with grain, ammunition, and clothing, sacrificing the lives and property of a large number of residents inside the city to encourage and support these puppet troops to continue their atrocities. When their own planes were damaged while committing such heinous crimes and were forced to land in the liberated area, our army sent teams to protect the planes and people to treat and entertain those injured who were supporting the puppet troops and engaging in civil war. How generous and magnanimous is this? How much compromise and seeking complete perfection for the sake of the country and the people? Anyone with a little humanity could not help but be moved. Unexpectedly, China has produced such a group of fascist elements who have no moral ethics. The next day, they sent fighter planes to massacre the Eighth Route Army soldiers who had rescued their pilots and the peaceful peasants who were working in the fields. How can such insane and depraved crimes not arouse the grief and indignation of the military and civilians in the liberated areas?!

    However, the seriousness of this incident goes far beyond this. The reason why the Chinese fascists are supporting the Yongnian puppet troops at all costs is to plant a civil war fortress in our liberated area, a springboard for a large-scale offensive against us, so that when the time is right, they can cooperate with the Kuomintang army in northern and eastern Henan to attack our liberated area from both inside and outside, realizing their dream of destroying our liberated area.

    We want to solemnly warn the Chinese fascist faction that is persisting in the civil war that your dreams will not be realized. The compromise and seeking complete perfection of the military and civilians in the liberated areas today is "bearing humiliation for the sake of the country," to avoid plunging the Chinese people into the abyss of civil war again, and it is not because we are afraid of you. When things develop to the point where we cannot protect peace without self-defense, they will be forced to take up the weapons of self-defense and teach these inhumane people a lesson. Today, the Yongnian issue has reached a point where it must be resolved. The military and civilians in the liberated areas demand surrender, demand that Kuomintang planes stop supporting the puppet troops, demand compensation for the wounded and killed, and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again. This is the minimum and reasonable demand. Otherwise, they will take necessary and appropriate measures to give the challengers the punishment they deserve.

### 抗议永年事件

    抗议永年事件
    继国民党飞机狂炸我东明军民之后，本月六日，国民党反动派又在永年城郊制造了一个惨无人道的血案。两架国民党战斗机疯狂轰炸扫射，我军及当地居民伤亡达三十三人。解放区军民听到这个痛心的消息，激起不可遏止的悲愤。
    被我解放区军民重重包围着的永年伪军，按照道理人情，早应由我军受降，孰料这些“人人得而诛之”的汉奸贼子，竟被国民党反动派视同珍宝，爱若宠儿，天天派飞机接济粮弹衣物，牺牲城内居民大量的生命财产，鼓励与支持这些伪军继续横行。自己的飞机在干这种罪恶勾当时损坏了，被迫降落在解放区，我军派队前往保护飞机，派人去医治与招待那些支援伪军、进行内战的负伤者；这是多么宽宏大度？为了国家人民，多么委曲求全？稍有人性者总不能没有丝毫的感动。不料中国偏偏出了这么一批毫无为人道德的法西斯分子，他们在第二天就派来战斗机虐杀援救他们飞行员的八路军，和正在田间劳作的和平农民，这种丧心病狂的罪行，怎能不激起解放区军民的悲愤？！
    然而，这次事件的严重性还远不止此。中国法西斯所以不惜一切代价支援永年伪军，目的是在我解放区中根植一个内战堡垒，一个向我大举进攻的跳板，以便时机一到，配合豫北豫东的国民党军内外夹击我解放区，实现其摧毁我解放区的迷梦。
    我们要正告坚持内战的中国法西斯派，你们的梦想是达不到的。解放区军民今日委曲求全，是“相忍为国”，是避免使中国人民重罹内战的涂炭，而并不是怕你们。当着事情发展到非自卫不能保卫和平的时候，他们会被迫拿起自卫的武器，教训他们这些没有人性的人。今天永年问题已到非解决不可的时候了，解放区军民要求受降，要求国民党飞机停止支持伪军，要求抚恤伤亡并保证不再发生类似事件，这是最低的、合理的要求。否则他们将采取必要而适当的方法，予挑战者以应有的惩罚。
