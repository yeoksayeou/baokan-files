    The Masses of This City Voluntarily Repair Roads
    [This City News] A section of approximately eighteen *li* of the Handan-Cizhou and Handan-Xingtai highways near the urban area of this city was damaged due to heavy traffic and prolonged neglect, making travel inconvenient. The government planned a semi-self-sufficient road repair mobilization. In Beimenli, where thirty people were originally supposed to be mobilized to repair sixty *zhang* of road, when the Farmers' Association chairman mobilized for road repair, more than sixty people voluntarily went and completed the task in half a day. When the comrades from the Municipal Construction Section arrived for inspection, the section had already been repaired and leveled, making it convenient for pedestrians. The masses in Changjiazhuang, Mengwu Village, Hejiazhuang, and Ganhegou villages in Dongmenli also voluntarily repaired roads, catching up with Beimenli. In addition, Zheng Shichang of Huaiyou Street, and Wang, Wei, and Yang, the three township chiefs of the front and back streets of Southwest Village, led the masses to repair streets and drainage ditches, and the work is still ongoing.

    本市群众自动修路
    【本市讯】本市市区附近邯磁与邯邢公路约十八里长之一段，因大车行走及经久未修之故，道路损坏，行走不便。政府拟半自给的动员修路。北门里本来应动员三十人，修路六十丈，当农会会长动员修路时，自动去了六十余人，在半天内便突击完成，待市府建设科同志赶赴检查时，该段已修整平坦，行人称便。东门里的常家庄，孟仵村、贺家庄、干河沟等村群众，亦自动进行修路赶上北门里。另有怀幼街郑世昌，西南庄前后街王魏杨三乡长领导群众修理街道及排水沟，现正仍继续进行中。（杜予）
