    Notice on Prevention and Control of Wheat Yellow Dwarf Disease
    To the Editor:
    Last year's autumn and winter had more rainfall, and a bumper wheat harvest is expected. Since the beginning of spring, there has been even more rain, and wheat yellow dwarf disease has become widespread on both banks of the Qing and Zhuo Zhang Rivers in Taihang, along the Pinghan Railway, and in the plains of southern Hebei, Henan, and Shandong. This not only affects this year's yield but, if prevention and control are not taken seriously, it will inevitably extend to next year. All localities should organize the masses to carry out possible prevention and control based on our existing rural conditions. We are introducing the harm and prevention methods of yellow dwarf disease for reference in various places.
    Yellow dwarf disease, also known as yellow rust, wheat rust, or spring red astringency disease, generally occurs because wheat is planted in shady and humid land, sown too late, or only with excessive nitrogen fertilizer (cottonseed cake, other oil cakes, human manure, etc.), or when there is continuous overcast and rainy weather, and the climate is warm and humid. When it occurs, the lower leaves first turn yellow, gradually extending to the upper leaves. Numerous oval yellow spots appear on the leaf surface, with yellow powder, eventually spreading to the glumes and wheat grains.
    After yellow dwarf disease occurs, the nutrients of the wheat are absorbed, and the development of the wheat is restricted. The wheat grains are not fully developed, which not only affects this year's yield, but if the wheat with yellow dwarf disease is used as seed, the spores of the disease-causing fungus will adhere to the wheat seeds. When the seeds germinate, the spores also germinate and invade the wheat seedlings, lying dormant until the wheat grows taller, at which point they parasitize the leaf mesophyll, reproduce, and absorb nutrients.
    Wheat is currently maturing, and prevention and control this year are impossible. We must plan for next year. Based on our existing conditions, we can carry out the following prevention and control methods:
    (1) When selecting seeds, pay attention to harvesting and storing separately wheat that has not been infected or has the least infection, as these are likely the most disease-resistant seeds, for use as seeds.
    (2) When sowing, use warm water soaking or salt water soaking.
    (3) Apply less oil cake and human manure (too little is also not good, as wheat needs a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer), and apply more plant ash and bone fertilizer (containing more potassium and phosphorus).
    (4) Sow at the appropriate time, not too early or too late. It is generally better to sow earlier, as the later the wheat matures, the more opportunities for pathogens to invade.
    (5) Pay attention to ensuring convenient drainage in wheat fields and avoid excessive standing water and dampness.
    (6) Call on the masses to purchase seeds in areas without yellow dwarf disease, and the government should collect a batch of wheat seeds in disease-free areas to prepare for the allocation to disaster areas with yellow dwarf disease this autumn.

### 注意防治小麦黄疸病

    注意防治小麦黄疸病编辑同志：
    去年秋冬两季雨量较多，小麦可望丰收，入春以来雨水更多，小麦黄疸病在太行之清浊漳两岸、平汉沿线、冀南、冀鲁豫平原，普遍发生。不仅影响到本年产量减低，如果不注意防治，势必延及下年，各地要根据我们农村现有条件，组织群众进行可能的防治，兹把黄疸病为害及防治法介绍出来，以供各地参考。
    黄疸病亦名黄锈病、麦锈病、春赤涩病，发生原因一般是由于小麦种在阴湿的地里及播种太迟，或仅多施氮素肥料（棉籽饼其他油饼人粪尿等），或遇阴雨连绵，气候温湿，即发生此病。发生时下部之叶，先变黄色，渐及上叶，叶面生无数椭圆形黄色斑点，有黄色粉末，最后延及鞘芒及麦粒上。
    黄疸病发生后，小麦养份被吸收，小麦发育受到限制，麦粒收不圆满，不仅影响本年产量，如以有黄疸病之小麦做种籽，其病源原菌之胞子附着麦种，种籽发芽，胞子亦同时发芽，侵入麦之幼芽中潜伏，至麦长高时，即寄生于叶肉中，繁殖吸取养份。
    目前小麦已成熟，本年防制已属不可能，须为下年打算，根据我们现有条件，可进行下述几个防治法：
    （一）注意选种时，把没有生病或生病最轻的小麦，可能是抗病力最强的种籽，另外收割和贮藏，用做种籽。
    （二）播种时，用温汤浸种或用盐水浸种。
    （三）少施些油饼、人粪尿（太少了也不好，麦子是需要多量的氮素肥料的），多施些草木灰和骨肥（含钾素、磷素多）。
    （四）播种要适时，不要过早或过迟，一般是早点较好，因小麦成熟愈迟，病菌侵袭机会愈多。
    （五）注意麦地排水便利，不要叫地面积水过分与阴湿。
    （六）号召群众在没有黄疸病的地购买种籽，政府并要在无黄疸病灾区征收一批麦种，准备今秋调剂有黄疸的灾区。
