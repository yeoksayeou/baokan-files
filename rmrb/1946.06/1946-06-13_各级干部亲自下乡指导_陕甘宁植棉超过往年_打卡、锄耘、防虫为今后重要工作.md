Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. The 356,155 mu of cotton in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region were all sown appropriately around the "Grain Rain" period, laying the foundation for the border region's 1.5 million people to spin and weave their own clothes and become self-sufficient. Thanks to the government's continuous efforts to improve it over the years, cotton planting this year has doubled compared to last year (last year it was 190,000 mu). Furthermore, efforts will be made to overcome the weakness of emphasizing quantity over quality in the past, improve cotton planting technology, and strive for an average yield of ten jin of cotton per mu, in order to achieve complete self-sufficiency in clothing.

This year, the entire border region's high enthusiasm for cotton planting is rare compared to previous years. The Guanzhong Sub-region exceeded the original plan by more than double, the Longdong Sub-region exceeded the original plan by one-third. The Yanshu and Suide Sub-regions had the heaviest tasks, but they have also been successfully completed. Many masses spontaneously expanded their cotton planting plans. In the Guanzhong area, many farmers had already spontaneously increased cotton fields before the cadres mobilized for spring plowing. When the Wanxiang Township Chief of Qingyang City in Longdong brought back cotton seeds from the city, the masses followed behind, scrambling to get a share. Many people in the Suide Sub-region benefited from cotton planting last year (last year, irrigation planting reached 40,000 mu), and with several rains this year, the masses have increased planting even more.

The main reason for the successful completion of this huge cotton planting task this spring is that cadres at all levels have improved their leadership style in cotton planting. They went deep into the countryside, persuaded the masses to plant cotton by calculating accounts, specifically solved difficulties such as land and cotton seeds, personally learned technology, and were able to grasp the farming season, and organize timely sowing. Various concrete facts, typical demonstrations, and summaries of experience were used in various places, and cotton farmers were organized to discuss technology, etc. Labor heroes were used to publicize to the masses, and then specifically organize and help the masses sow, so that this year's initial and huge cotton planting task could be successfully completed. However, to obtain 3.5 million jin of cotton from 350,000 mu of fields, the people of the entire border region and cadres at all levels must continue to work hard and not be satisfied with the number of acres already planted. Cadres should study and disseminate technology in the field, and regularly lead the masses in thinning, weeding, and pest control without violating the farming season, which will be the most important work in the future.

### 各级干部亲自下乡指导  陕甘宁植棉超过往年  打卡、锄耘、防虫为今后重要工作

    各级干部亲自下乡指导
    陕甘宁植棉超过往年
    打卡、锄耘、防虫为今后重要工作
    【新华社延安七日电】陕甘宁边区三十五万六千一百五十五亩棉花，于“谷雨”前后都适时下种，为边区一百五十万人民的自纺自织，穿衣自给，打下了基础。在政府历年不断提高下，今年棉花种植比去年增加一倍（去年为十九万亩），且将克服往年重量不重质的弱点，提高植棉技术，争取每亩平均产棉十斤，以求全部穿衣自给。
    今年全边区人民高度的植棉情绪，为往年所罕见，关中分区超过原计划一倍强，陇东分区超过原计划三分之一，延属和绥德分区任务最重，也已胜利完成，群众自动扩大植棉计划者甚多，关中区不少农户在干部未动员春耕前则已纷纷自动增棉田，陇东庆阳市万乡乡长从市上带回棉籽时，群众就跟在后边抢着要分。绥德分区许多群众去年植棉得了利（去年浇种即达四万亩），今年又下了几场雨，群众更纷纷增种。
    今春所以能完成这项巨大植棉任务，其主要原因为各级干部在植棉中改进了领导作风，他们深入农村，用算账方式说服群众植棉，具体解决土地、棉籽等困难，亲自学习技术，并能掌握农时，及时组织下种，此处各地用各种具体事实，典型示范总结经验，组织棉农座谈技术等方法，通过劳动英雄向群众宣传，并进而具体组织和帮助群众下种，使今年得能胜利完成初步而巨大的植棉任务。但要从三十五万亩田里取得三百五十万斤棉花，还待全边区人民及各级干部继续努力，不能满足于已下种的数目字，干部实地学习和传播技术，不违农时的经常领导群众打卡、锄耘、防虫，成为今后最重要的工作。
