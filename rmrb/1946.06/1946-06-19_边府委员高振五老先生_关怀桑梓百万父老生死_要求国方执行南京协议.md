[Special Report from This Newspaper] A reporter recently visited Elder Gao Zhenwu, a member of the Border Government Administrative Committee, to inquire about his opinions on the issue of restoring and blocking the Yellow River embankment. Mr. Gao is a native of Qingfeng and is sixty-seven years old this year. With a silver beard, he is full of vigor. Before the War of Resistance, he taught in the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Shanxi, and has many students. After the War of Resistance, he continued to preside over education and administration in the Liberated Areas, training a large number of cadres for the War of Resistance and national construction. Since the proposal of "Returning the Yellow River to its Old Course," Mr. Gao has been concerned about the life and death of millions of people in his hometown and has been working day and night to participate in the Border Government's research and planning for this major event, which has been extremely hard work. Mr. Gao said: "The relationship of this matter is really too great. Hundreds of thousands of people, upon hearing that the Yellow River is to return, are all panicking and telling each other. During the meeting of the参议会 [Provincial Assembly], Elder Gu Zihui, a参议员 [Provincial Assembly Member] from Juancheng, cried loudly on behalf of the people. Elder Gu used to be the head of the Yellow River weir and knows the ferocity of the Yellow River deeply. He said: 'Hundreds of thousands of people are running around shouting. The Border Government has held dozens of meetings on this matter and has handled countless negotiations. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has also strongly assisted, and finally, the Heze Agreement was established. Unfortunately, this agreement was not implemented by the Kuomintang. After continuous efforts from all sides and justified arguments, the Nanjing Agreement was established.'" He emphasized: "We sincerely support the Nanjing Agreement and must ensure that it is thoroughly implemented." "However," he said, "we must be very vigilant. The Kuomintang reactionaries have always treated human life as a child's play. Its habit is to be duplicitous, saying one thing and doing another. The Central News Agency also likes to spread rumors, deceive, and distort the truth. We must mobilize the strength of all democrats and the people of the whole country to insist on the 100% implementation of the Nanjing Agreement. And we must always let the people of the whole country understand the truth of this matter." Mr. Gao expressed great indignation and dissatisfaction at the delay in the arrival of the work grain, equipment, and relief funds for river management. He said: "From this matter, I highly doubt whether the Kuomintang reactionaries have the sincerity to implement the Nanjing Agreement. Now the people in the Liberated Areas are working hard to repair the river. In such hot weather, some wheat has not yet been harvested. Everyone is ignoring everything in order to save their lives, and hundreds of thousands of people are rushing to repair the embankment. However, they can't work on an empty stomach! The Liberated Areas have endured eight years of war and several years of famine, and cannot support this huge burden. The government is trying to find solutions, and the people are helping each other, but it is still far from the actual needs." He warned: "The Kuomintang should quickly transport the things it promised and keep its word. Otherwise, it will inevitably lead to everyone's opposition and everyone's indignation."

    边府委员高振五老先生
    关怀桑梓百万父老生死
    要求国方执行南京协议
    【本报特访】记者日前访谒边府行政委员高振五老先生，叩询他对于黄河复堤堵口的意见。高先生籍隶清丰，现年六十七岁。一抹银髯，精神矍铄。抗战前执教于冀、鲁、豫、晋诸省，桃李门墙甚多。抗战后继续在解放区主持教政，训练了大批的抗战建国干部。自“黄河归故”提出后，高先生关怀桑梓故里几百万父老子弟的生死问题，日夜参与边府对这件大事的研究筹划，极为辛苦。高先生说：这件事情的关系实在是太大了，几百万人听到黄河要回来，莫不人心惶惶，奔走相告。开参议会的时候，鄄城参议员谷子惠老先生为民请命，放声大哭。谷老先生过去当过黄河堰长，深知黄河的凶毒。他说：“几百万人奔走呼号，边府为这件事开边几十次会，办过多少次交涉，中共中央也大力襄助，总算成立了个荷泽协议。不幸这个协议并未被国民党见诸实行。经过各方面继续努力，据理力争，又成立了南京协议。”他强调指出：“我们对南京协议是竭诚拥护，一定要使他彻底实行的。”“但是”他说：“我们还得十分警惕。国民党反动派从来是以人命为儿戏，它的惯性是口是心非，说了不作。中央社又喜欢造谣，蒙蔽与歪曲事实真象。我们一定要动员起所有民主人士和全国人民的力量，坚持百分之百的实行南京协议。并且要随时把这件事的真象让全国老百姓弄清楚。”高先生对于治河的工粮、器材和救济费用迟迟不来，表示极大的愤慨与不满。他说：“从这件事情上，我很怀疑国民党反动派有没有实行南京协议的诚意。现在解放区的老百姓都在为修河拚命，这么热的天气，有的麦子还没有割完，大家为了活命，都顾不得了，几十万人赶去修堤。但是，总不能饿着肚子作工啊！解放区八年抗战，几年灾荒，实在不能支持这个庞大的负担了，政府想办法，老百姓互助互借，都离实际需要尚远。”他提出警告道：“国民党应该把答应了的东西赶快运来，说了话要算话。否则必然弄得大家反对，人人愤慨。”
