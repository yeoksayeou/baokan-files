Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, May 29th: Shanghai Wenhui Daily published an editorial on May 15th, "A Message to General Marshall," warning the United States that it should completely withdraw from the scene of the Chinese civil war and not be dragged into a disreputable mire by Chinese warmongers, believing this to be a significant factor in eliminating the Chinese civil war. The article stated: "Our people must solemnly inform the special envoy and friendly nations that while the Chinese civil war experts are painstakingly instigating the expansion of the civil war, they will definitely try to pull American friends into this mire. In fact, if they cannot ensnare American friends, the Chinese civil war experts would never dare to try easily. Therefore, we hope that the special envoy will be quick-witted and seize this opportunity that could determine the course of events, to immediately remove all factors that could directly or indirectly help or encourage the Chinese civil war, separating them from the war scene. If American friends still avoid suspicion and insist on staying in the middle, even if they do not directly take actions to fuel the Chinese civil war, they will inevitably cause the Chinese people to suspect that American friends have developed an interest in the Chinese civil war." The article continued by advising the U.S. military not to provide military assistance to Chinese warmongers to counteract the special envoy's peace efforts. "The special envoy should do everything within his power to eliminate all factors that could fuel the civil war first." "What exactly is the purpose of the American troops in the Bohai Bay? What exactly is the purpose of the American troops landing on the Liaodong Peninsula? We can assert that any action taken by the U.S. military within Chinese territory, especially in places where the civil war crisis is severe, is enough to negate the special envoy's efforts over the past few months in the capital. Our people can guarantee that as long as friendly nations completely withdraw from the scene of the civil war, the Chinese people's own strength will be sufficient to stop the civil war." The article concluded by expressing the hope that General Marshall would listen more to the voices of the Chinese people, that the Chinese people are now fully capable of distinguishing between right and wrong, good and evil, that the Chinese people have already recognized their own future, that the Chinese people cannot be conquered by any brute force, and that the Chinese people themselves already possess the strength to resist any unreasonable oppression that violates the will of the people. The special envoy must listen to these voices of the people so that your efforts will not be in vain, and the Chinese people, with your assistance, will resolutely embark on the path they have chosen.

    沪文汇报正告美国友人
    勿被好战分子拖入泥淖
    希望马歇尔将军消灭一切助长内战因素
    【新华社延安二十九日电】沪文汇报五月十五日发表社评“告马歇尔将军”一文，正告美国应从中国内战的场面中完全站出，勿被中国好战分子拖入不名誉的泥淖，认为这是消弭中国内战的重大因素。该文称：“我们人民必须正告特使和友邦人士，中国内战专家们在处心积虑掀动扩大内战时，一定要把美国友人拉到这泥淖中。事实上，假使不拉住美国友人，中国内战专家们，绝不敢轻易尝试的。所以我们希望特使要眼明手快，抓住这毫厘千里的时机，使美国一切足以直接或间接帮助或鼓舞中国内战的因素，立即脱开战争场面。假使美国友人仍旧不避嫌疑地还要夹在中间，则纵使不以直接行动来助长中国内战，但也绝不能不使中国人民怀疑美国友人对于中国内战发生了兴趣”。该文继忠告美军切勿给中国好战分子以军事援助，来抵消特使之和平努力。“特使应就自己能力所及，把一切足以助长内战的因素首先消灭掉”。“渤海湾的美国军队究竟为什么？美军在辽东半岛的登陆究竟为什么？我们可以断言，美军在中国境内，尤其在内战危机严重的地方，任何行动都足以抵消特使在首都几个月的努力。我们人民可以保证，只要友邦人士从内战的场面中完全站开，中国人民自己的力量，是足以制止内战的”。该文最后希望马歇尔将军多多倾听中国人民的呼声，中国人民现在已经充分能够辨别是非善恶，中国人民已经认清了自己的前途，中国人民亦非任何蛮横的武力所能征服，中国人民自己已经具备了力量，足以抗拒任何不合理的违反人民意志的压迫。特使必须倾听这些人民的呼声，使你的努力不致落空，而中国人民在你的协助之下，将断然走上自己所抉择的道路。
