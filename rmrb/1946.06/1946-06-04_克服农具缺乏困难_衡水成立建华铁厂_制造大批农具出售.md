    Overcoming the Shortage of Farm Tools
    Hengshui Establishes Jianhua Iron Factory
    Manufacturing and Selling Large Quantities of Farm Tools
    [Report from our newspaper in Wei County] During the eight years of enemy occupation in Hengshui, the farm tools used in production by the broad masses were largely destroyed. Now, in order to solve this problem for the masses and launch a large-scale production campaign, the Fifth Special District Commissioner's Office, the Sub-District Supply Department, and the local city's Chengguan (town) businesses Yongjuxing Iron Shop, Hongshengzhan Iron Shop, and Gongxinghao Iron Shop have pooled a total of 1.05 million yuan in capital to establish the privately-run, publicly-assisted Jianhua Pig Iron Factory. It has now been in operation for more than 40 days. A large quantity of pig iron farm tools such as plowshares, plow mouldboards, and seeder feet are being produced, and various machine parts are also being manufactured in large quantities. The factory has 25 workers. The furnace uses a manual blower and burns 3,000 jin of coke per day, which can melt 4,000 to 5,000 jin of pig iron and produce 120 pots (of molten iron) and several hundred other farm tools. The furnace is only fired for 20 days per month, with a day or two set aside every five days for making molds. The iron is sourced from the countryside through collection and purchase, costing four to five yuan per jin. Many people also exchange scrap iron for farm tools, at a rate of six jin of scrap iron for one jin of finished product. The number of small iron shops in the city and countryside has increased, and rural iron peddlers are constantly coming and going. There is a phenomenon of supply falling short of demand for the factory's products. The factory is now expanding the furnace blower and plans to use horsepower or a diesel engine in the future. It also plans to manufacture cotton gins and cotton carding machines in large quantities to develop Hengshui's textile industry.

    克服农具缺乏困难
    衡水成立建华铁厂
    制造大批农具出售
    【本报威县讯】衡水在八年敌人的侵占中，广大群众生产的农具，多遭破坏。现在为解决群众这一困难，开展大生产运动，五专署、分区供给处、和本城城关商号永聚兴铁铺，鸿升栈铁铺，公兴号铁铺，集合股金一百零五万元，开办了私营公助的建华生铁厂。现已开工四十多天。犁铧、犁镜、耧脚、等生铁农具，均有大量生产，并配制各种机器零件，大量出锅。该厂有工人二十五名，锅炉是人力吹风机，每天烧焦炭三千斤，能化生铁四五千斤，能出锅一百二十口，其他农具数百件。每月只开火二十天，因隔五天设制模一两天，铁的来源从乡下搜集收买，每斤四元至五元，也有很多群众用废铁兑换农具的，其兑额为六斤废铁换一斤成品。城关和乡下小铁铺增加了，乡村小铁贩往来不断，工厂产品有供不应求现象。现在该厂正扩大锅炉吹风，将来准备用马力或柴油机，并拟大批制造轧花车，弹花机，以发展衡水的纺织业。
