(Our Newspaper, Yangcheng, 3rd dispatch) Under the instruction of Yan Xishan's "Shanxi Military Management Headquarters" secret order (telegram) No. 115, the special agent activities in Jiang County, led by Chen Ziwen, began in mid-April. Taking Xulu峪, Jiang County, as a base, they transferred more than 100 "Love the Homeland Corps" squad and platoon leaders for short-term special agent training to form an "assassination team" led by Ma Duo. They infiltrated 29 villages in the liberated areas of Lanyu, Beiliu, and Gulongpo, colluding with local traitors and despots, carrying weapons, and operating covertly both day and night to carry out assassinations, captures, and various acts of sabotage. Statistics for just half a month, from April 17th to May 2nd, show that such cases reached as many as 30. They brutally murdered 11 government cadres, including village heads Zhang Xixian of Lanlin and other villages, 16 civilians, including Song Fucai, 2 militiamen, including Jin Qingyun, and 1 teacher, Sun Zhefu; wounded 5 village government cadres including Qin Xueren; captured 2 teachers, 1 student, and 9 civilians; and robbed 3 livestock and 5 rifles. 65,000 people in Jiang County have jointly submitted petitions to the Eighth Route Army, requesting the use of force to stop the atrocities of the special agents under Chen Ziwen's command of the Yan army. We have now reported this to the Linfen Executive Group, requesting effective measures be taken. According to the secret telegram No. 115 of the Shanxi Military Management Headquarters, Chen Ziwen was instructed: "Secretly set up spies and informers to establish underground organizations so that, after thoroughly understanding the enemy's strength, both real and fictitious, and the number of their weapons, gradually enter the occupied areas (i.e., the liberated areas) by means of surprise attacks, secretly organize "people's" armed forces, and secretly establish village governments."

    【本报阳城三日电】以陈子文为首的绛县特务活动，在阎锡山的“山西军管理司令部”军役字第一一五号密令（代电）指示下，于四月中旬即开始以绛县续鲁峪为基点，抽调“爱乡团”班排长百余人，进行短期特务训练，组成“暗杀队”，由马铎任队长，潜入解放区兰峪、北柳、古隆坡一带二十九村，勾结当地汉奸恶霸，携带武器，昼伏夜出，进行暗杀、捕捉与各种破坏活动，仅四月十七至五月二日半月统计，此类案件即达三十次之多。计惨杀兰赁等村村闾长张希贤等政权干部十一人，群众宋福才等十六人，民兵靳清云等二人，教员孙哲甫一人，击伤村政权干部秦学仁等五人；捕去教员二人，学生一人，群众九人；抢去牲口三头，步枪五支。绛县六万五千群众，纷纷联名向八路军呈递控诉状，要求以武力制止阎军陈子文部特务暴行。现我已向临汾执行小组报告，要求作有效之处置。按山西军管理司令部军役字第一一五号密电，曾指示陈子文说：“暗设坐探、密探，建立地下组织，使对叛匪兵力虚实及武装多寡彻底了解后，用突击方式渐次进入侵占区（即解放区），密组“民众”武装，暗设村闾政权。”
