Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, May 31st: *Jiefang Ribao* (Liberation Daily) today published an editorial titled "On the Closing of the Beiping *Jiefang Bao* Incident and a Warning to the Reactionaries." The full text is as follows:

    On the 29th of this month, the Kuomintang authorities illegally closed the Beiping *Jiefang Bao* and the Xinhua Branch Office. This perverse act by the reactionary faction within the Kuomintang is not only a frenzied attack on the freedom of speech of the national press and the people's rights, but also a concrete step towards expanding the civil war. Since the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), the Kuomintang authorities have continuously violated agreements, broken the four promises, and suppressed freedom of speech. Just and upright press organs and people throughout the country, representing the will of the people and advocating peace and democracy while opposing civil war and dictatorship, have been constantly subjected to violent aggression. From disrupting distribution and destroying newspaper offices, to beating reporters and assassinating journalists, there have been hundreds of cases, including the recent forced closure of the Xi'an *Wenfeng Gongshang Ribao* and the murder of Mr. Li Furen and Mr. Wang Ren. *Jiefang Bao* and the Xinhua Branch Office were among the most resolute and heroic of these just press organs. From the second day of its publication, the Beiping *Jiefang Bao* fought unyieldingly against the sabotage and illegal violence of the Kuomintang authorities' secret agents. The Kuomintang authorities used all kinds of shameless means to attack this people's press organ, including instructing secret agents to beat newspaper vendors, intimidating reporters, threatening printing houses to stop mailing, disrupting distribution, and even directly arresting staff. However, all these atrocities by the Kuomintang authorities failed to achieve the goal of strangling the Beiping *Jiefang Bao*. With the support of the broad masses of the people, the Beiping *Jiefang Bao* broke through all restrictions of blockade and suppression, and its circulation increased day by day. After the Kuomintang authorities arrested the staff of the *Jiefang Bao* and the Xinhua Branch Office on April 3rd, sales soared to 43,000 copies, breaking the highest sales record of all newspapers in Beijing and Tianjin. In the short period of only three or four months since its publication, the Beiping *Jiefang Bao* has not only been eagerly purchased and read by the broad masses of the people in the Beijing-Tianjin area, but has also gained a high reputation throughout the country and even overseas, becoming one of the most prominent beacons of peace and democracy in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. But this has further incurred the jealousy of the Kuomintang authorities, leading them to tear off all pretense and close the Beiping *Jiefang Bao* and the Xinhua Branch Office under the watchful eyes of the people and democratic人士 throughout the country. The destruction of the Beiping *Jiefang Bao* and the Xi'an *Qinfeng Gongshang Ribao* proves the Kuomintang authorities' fascist policy: whoever advocates peace and democracy will be closed down. If we look at the current serious situation, it is even more worthy of great vigilance from the people of the country! The closure of the Beiping *Jiefang Bao* and the Xinhua Branch Office coincided with the Eleventh War Zone Command of the Kuomintang in Beiping issuing a secret order to launch a large-scale offensive against the eastern Hebei liberated area. It coincided with the Kuomintang authorities persisting in forcibly taking over the Northeast, continuing to expand the civil war in the Northeast, and intensifying the blockade and armed invasion, arson, and looting of the liberated areas in various parts of Guannei (areas within the Great Wall), actively sabotaging the peaceful construction of the liberated areas. What is especially noteworthy is that this incident occurred while Chiang Kai-shek was traveling back and forth between Beiping, Shenyang, and Changchun, personally directing the anti-people civil war in the Northeast and arranging for the civil war in North China. Closing the beacon of peace and democracy—the Beiping *Jiefang Bao* and the Xinhua Branch Office—was precisely to blind the eyes and ears of the people, so that they could expand the civil war with impunity. Isn't this clear enough?! This incident is not only a frenzied attack on the just press and the people's freedom of rights throughout the country, but is also inseparable from the Kuomintang authorities' actions to expand the civil war. Isn't this also clear enough?! The reactionary ruling clique within the Kuomintang is stepping up the strangulation of the people's press organs and the destruction of the people's freedom, as evidenced by the recent implementation of fascist "police control" in Shanghai and other places. This shows how relentlessly this reactionary clique, which has always made a career out of poisoning the people and has made no contribution to the War of Resistance, clings to its fascist dictatorship after the victory of the War of Resistance; how much it hates the Chinese people, who sacrificed countless lives and blood in the War of Resistance and are now urgently demanding peace and democracy; and how much it despises and tramples on the minimum democratic reforms stipulated in the PCC resolutions, refusing to implement even one of them. The Kuomintang's reactionary faction's deliberate and reckless behavior does not indicate its strength. On the contrary, it precisely indicates the extreme decay of its rule. In the face of the angry tide of the Chinese people demanding peace and democracy, it has to resort to the most barbaric fascist means to maintain and consolidate its fascist dictatorial rule, and even vainly attempts, with the assistance of foreign countries, to expand the civil war and complete its despicable plan to "eliminate the Communist Party and the democratic movement, which was interrupted by the War of Resistance," in one fell swoop. However, we want to warn you gentlemen again: your subjective wishes can never be realized! The unprecedentedly powerful force of the Chinese people cannot be eliminated! The democratic tide of the whole of China and the whole world cannot be resisted! The wheel of history cannot be reversed! If you insist on the path of dictatorship and civil war, and do not hesitate to take further desperate and risky actions, it will be extremely dangerous for yourselves! The consequences of your risky actions will be completely contrary to your subjective wishes!

    The closing of the Beiping *Jiefang Bao* and the serious situation in China today will awaken the Chinese people to be more vigilant, unite, and continue to strive to smash the dictatorial and civil war policy of the reactionary faction within the Kuomintang, to realize the three major agreements that have been destroyed by the reactionary faction, and to strive for the freedom of speech and various freedoms of the people! The Chinese people demonstrated unparalleled heroism and great strength in the War of Resistance, defeated the Japanese invaders, and won the victory of the War of Resistance. Today, the Chinese people have full confidence in smashing the conspiracies of the fascist reactionaries, safeguarding the fruits of the War of Resistance, and winning the victory of peace and democracy.

    延安解放日报社论：
    论北平解放报事件并警告反动派
    【新华社延安三十一日电】解放日报今日社论题《论北平解放报事件并警告反动派》，全文如下：
    国民党当局于本月二十九日竟将北平解放报及新华分社非法封闭，国民党内反动派这种倒行逆施，不仅是对全国言论界和人民自由权利的疯狂进攻，而且也是扩大内战的具体步骤。自政协会以后，国民党当局即不断破坏协定，违背四项诺言，摧残言论自由，全国各地代表人民意志主张和平民主反对内战独裁的公正言论机关和正义人士，即不断地遭受着暴力的侵略，从破坏发行捣毁报馆殴打报人暗害新闻记者，直到最近西安文风工商日报的被迫停刊，李敷仁、王任两先生的遇害，前后达百数十件，解放报及新华分社是这些公正的言论机关中最表现坚决英勇的一个。北平解放报从出版的第二天起，即不屈不挠的与国民党当局的特务破坏和非法暴行进行战斗，国民党当局以指使特务殴打报贩恐吓记者威胁印刷所停止邮寄破坏发行甚至于直接逮捕工作人员以及一切其他无耻手段，来打击这一个人民的言论机关，但国民党当局的这一切暴行，都不能达到绞杀北平解放报的目的，在广大人民群众的拥护之下，北平解放报打破了一切封销压迫的限制，销数日愈增涨。四月三日国民党当局逮捕解放报及新华分社工作人员之后，销售反而激增至四万三千份，打破了平津一切报纸销售的最高纪录。在出版以来，仅三四个月的短短时期中，北平解放报已不但在平津一带为广大人民群众所争购爱读，而且在全国甚至海外各地也声望日高，成为国民党统治区里最明显的和平民主灯塔之一，但这就会更遭受到国民党当局的嫉恨，使它竟不惜撕毁一切假面具，在全国人民及民主人士的众目昭彰之下，将北平解放报和新华分社封闭。北平解放报和西安秦风工商日报等被摧毁的事实，证明国民党当局的法西斯政策，谁主张和平民主，谁就在被封闭之列。如果我们看一看当前严重的时局，更值得全国人民大大地警惕！北平解放报与新华分社的被封闭，适在北平国民党十一战区司令长官部下机密命令大举进攻冀东解放区之时，适在国民党当局在东北坚持武力接收东北继续扩大东北内战，和在关内各地对解放区加紧封锁和武装侵犯焚烧抢掠积极破坏解放区和平建设之时，尤其值得注意的，这一事件适值蒋介石仆仆风尘往返于北平沈阳长春之间，亲自指挥东北反人民内战与布置华北内战之时，封闭和平民主的灯塔——北平解放报和新华分社，正是为了将人民的眼睛和耳朵蒙蔽起来，以便肆无忌惮地扩大内战，难道这还不够明白吗？！这一事件不仅是对于全国正义言论界和人民自由权利的疯狂进攻，而且也是和国民党当局扩大内战的行动分不开的，难道这也还不够明白吗！？国民党内反动统治集团加紧绞杀人民言论机关和摧残人民自由，例如最近在上海等地施行法西斯的“警管制”的事实，说明这一向来以荼毒的人民为能事，对于抗战丝毫没有功劳的反动集团，在抗战胜利以后，对于自己的法西斯独裁是怎样锲而不舍；对于抗战中牺牲无数头卢鲜血和今天迫切要求和平民主的中国人民，是如何仇视痛恨；对于政协会决议所规定的起码民主改革，是怎样蔑视蹂躏，一项也不愿意实行。国民党内反动派的故作妄为，并不表示它的力量强大，相反的，恰恰表示它的统治的极端腐朽，它在全中国人民要求和平民主的怒潮之前，不得不乞灵于最野蛮的法西斯手段，以维持和巩固法西斯独裁统治，甚至于妄想在外国的援助之下，扩大内战，一鼓而完成其“为抗战所中断的消灭共产党与民主运动”的卑污打算。然而，我们要再次警告你们这些老爷们：你们的主观愿望，是决不能实现的！中国人民的空前强大力量，是无法消灭的！全中国和全世界的民主潮流，是无法抗拒的！历史的车轮，是无法扭转的！你们如果一意孤行坚持独裁内战的方针，不惜进一步作孤注一掷的冒险行动，那对于你们自己是极端危险的！你们的冒险行动的后果，将完完全全和你们的主观愿望相反！
    北平解放报被封闭事件，及今天中国的严重局势，将唤起中国人民更加警惕，团结起来，再接再厉为粉碎国民党内反动派的独裁内战政策而奋斗，为实现被反动派破坏的三大协定而奋斗，为争取人民言论及各种自由而奋斗！中国人民在抗战中表现了无比的英勇和伟大的力量，击败了日寇，取得了抗战的胜利；今天中国人民有充分的信心，粉碎法西斯反动派的阴谋，保卫抗战果实，争取和平民主的胜利。
