How the Mass Movement in the New An'yang District Was Launched?
Collective Discussion
Sun Ziying, Author

I.

Before the mass movement, the old feudal ruling forces in the newly liberated An'yang area were like a heavy millstone, weighing heavily on the heads of the peasants. The local masses vividly described the social characteristics of the past with four phrases: "Landlord cliques, tyrannical systems," "A world of black guns, packs of lackeys."

These rural ruling groups had their organizations scattered throughout the villages, such as "Twelve Committees," "Eight Chief Managers," and "Boards of Directors." At the same time, they used a group of thugs and bandits to establish their own armed forces – bureaus. They consistently had close collusion with enemy puppet troops. In addition, An'yang was the vanguard of the Kuomintang reactionaries' offensive against our Pinghan Liberated Area. KMT special agents also specially organized six or seven hundred special agent armed forces and colluded with the local landlord ruling groups, using black guns everywhere to attack peasant activists who were turning over, implementing a bloody armed rule over the peasants.

Thus, black guns became the greatest disaster for the peasants of An'yang. If the peasants slightly displeased the landlords, black guns would come down on their heads, even implicating relatives and friends. For example, in the 11th District of the county, fifteen peasants were killed in one night, directly threatening the peasant's emancipation movement.

However, the black guns did not scare the masses. The peasants organized armed forces to protect their own movement of venting grievances and turning over. The An'yang mass movement gradually developed under these circumstances. According to statistics from seven districts in the county, mass movements had started in all but forty-nine villages out of four hundred and twenty-one natural villages, even in villages three to five miles away from the Kuomintang and puppet troops.

II.

The following methods launched the vigorous emancipation movement of the masses in An'yang:

1.  "Lighting big fires" and "lighting small fires": In most villages in the new area, the foundation for mass work was poor. Therefore, how to ignite the fire of the masses' emancipation was a very important issue; otherwise, it would be futile and fruitless. Initially, An'yang took some detours. This was because the leadership emphasized the laws of struggle, mechanically applied the experience of the old areas, and subjectively stipulated starting with anti-corruption and anti-traitorous bullies (this does not mean that leadership and direction are unnecessary). Here, we neglected a very simple but most fundamental principle: "Starting from the demands of the masses." In the actual movement, it gradually became clear that starting with the most common and pressing demands of the masses was the easiest way to ignite the "fire." Because the reactionary forces and reactionary public opinion in the new area were particularly strong, grasping mass issues at the beginning was the easiest way to gain social sympathy and reduce resistance. If starting with individual issues, the effect on influencing the masses was actually not great. The experience of Xi Gaoping fully proves this. At first, we started by solving a few pawnshop problems. Although a few problems were solved, the situation was not opened up. Later, after seizing the most hated traitorous bully, Hu Zigang, to conduct a settlement, the situation was opened up in a few days. Therefore, it is necessary to "light big fires" at the beginning, so that the movement will not be extinguished by the reactionary arrogance. "Lighting small fires" makes the movement most prone to die young.

2. Grasping tightly in thought, "letting go" in action: At the beginning, the issue of "letting go" was not resolved in the cadres' minds. The central key was that the cadres had the idea of not believing that the masses would handle problems themselves. They believed that the people of An'yang were "slippery" and "easy to rise up but difficult to control." They were afraid that the higher levels would blame them if problems arose. Therefore, the first step must be to solve the problem of believing in the masses. At the same time, the leadership must emphasize supporting the cadres. Only when the cadres' "hands" are released can the masses' "hands" be released. This is the decisive key. But how to "let go"? Many failed experiences have proven that to "let go" in action, one must grasp tightly in thought. Only when the masses' awareness is stimulated in thought, and they are clearly given policies as weapons, and then "let go" in action and let the masses do it, will the masses fully exert their creativity in action. Not solving the masses' thoughts, only letting the masses do it, thinking that whatever the masses do is what it is, would only be abandoning the leadership's mass spontaneous action. Not solving thoughts, but instead substituting for and monopolizing everything in action, can only make the masses weak and powerless. However, solving thoughts does not mean waiting until thoughts are completely solved before acting. At the beginning, only some preliminary solutions can be made. The main thing is to educate in action.

3.  Venting grievances and settling accounts: Mobilizing the masses not only requires the masses to turn over economically, but also to be resolved ideologically. The disasters suffered by the peasants from the landlords are a ledger of blood and tears. Venting grievances is to pour out the long-term accounts recorded in the hearts of the peasants. Settling accounts is to make the masses clear about the exploitative relationship and solve the issue of who relies on whom to live. The two are the soul of opening up the masses' thoughts, so they must be combined. Only venting grievances without settling accounts cannot make the specific exploitation of the landlords against the peasants clear, and the class consciousness of the peasants will not be materialized, and it will only become a simple venting of grievances. Similarly, only settling accounts without venting grievances cannot expose the specific darkness of the landlords against the peasants, and the peasants' enthusiasm for struggle will not be more substantial and powerful, and the landlords' faces will not be completely torn apart.

4.  The combination of two forms and two methods: In order to expose the landlords' deception of the masses and fully enable the peasants to understand the rationality of their own emancipation struggle, two methods must be adopted: First, top-down, openly and on a large scale, publicize and mobilize the masses, making general appeals. This method is particularly important at the beginning of the mass movement in the new area. Only in this way can the landlords' deception be exposed and support be given to the masses. Second, bottom-up, secret and small-scale mass activities (this is due to the powerful reactionary forces in the border areas - editor). The former method provides convenient conditions for the latter method. After the top-down public appeals and mobilization, there should be secret communication from the bottom up, discovering problems, organizing small-scale venting of grievances, and then concentrating to go public after maturity. Facts have proved that the two must be carried out in coordination and cannot be neglected. At the beginning, some comrades, once they arrived in the village, did not even hold a meeting, but ran to communicate with the masses. The masses did not even know what they were doing. As a result, days of effort could not withstand a single destructive word from the landlord. On the contrary, some only made general public appeals and mobilization, without combining bottom-up communication. As a result, problems could not be discovered, and some monopolized and substituted for the masses. This is a method that is rough but also fine. Only being "rough" without being "fine" cannot fully mobilize the masses. Only being "fine" without being "rough" cannot quickly open up the situation. When the united struggle has been carried out, the situation has been opened up, and the masses have been mobilized, the problems raised by the masses have become more complex, and there are more objects for reasoning. However, at this time, the handling of problems must be more meticulous, so that all problems can be resolved appropriately.

5.  The issue of combining armed force and reasoning: The characteristic of the An'yang mass movement is not only to reason, but also to counter black guns. Because the emancipation movement of the masses in An'yang is not carried out in a stable environment, but under the internal and external attack and overt and covert alliance of the landlord reactionaries. In the movement, without armed protection, the masses would not be brave, and the movement would be difficult to carry out. Therefore, once the masses acted, they strongly demanded armed forces, even buying guns regardless of money. If there were no guns, they would take grenades. This practical action of the masses was learned from the struggle against the landlord class.

6.  The issue of mass organization construction: – Peasants' Association. When the masses first rise up, and it is time to organize the Peasants' Association, there is still a kind of suspicion between the peasants. In particular, many speculators attempt to take the opportunity to infiltrate the Peasants' Association. Therefore, at this time, the masses' requirements for those who participate in the Peasants' Association are very strict, and the discipline is very strict. This is a good phenomenon, which shows the masses' high vigilance. At this time, emphasis should be placed on quality rather than quantity. But after the masses rise up, they should let go and absorb the broad masses. At this time, both quality and quantity should be emphasized.

7.  The resolution of issues between peasants: When resolving the issues between peasants and landlords, the contradictions between peasants and peasants generally occur less. Some are latent, but when the issues between peasants and landlords are slightly stalled or eased, the issues between peasants come out, and various unsolidarities occur. This is mostly due to the landlords' provocation, or the cadres' favoritism, selfishness, and lack of democracy. Therefore, the issues between peasants should be different from the issues against landlords, and internal mediation should be adopted to resolve them. The most important thing is to guide the masses to reflect on themselves and wash their faces. This not only consolidates the unity between the peasants, but also strikes at the landlords' sowing discord. Only paying attention to resolving the issues against the landlords, but not paying attention to resolving the masses' own unity, will relax the masses' strength and prevent them from effectively organizing the reasoning struggle against the landlords.

8.  The issue of using activists and contacting the masses: The criteria for activists must be more progressive than the masses, and must not be divorced from the masses. If we simply regard the activists as those who dare to do and dare to speak, and ignore whether they can represent the masses, then the leadership will form an activity of a few people, and will not be able to bring the masses along. Even for the activists who truly represent the masses, they should of course be used boldly, believed in, and relied on to bring the masses along. But on the other hand, they should also be educated at all times to overcome the distance between the past activists' thoughts and the masses' thoughts, and consolidate their connection with the masses. In this way, the leadership can grasp the masses' thoughts, and can often discover new problems. At the same time, in the leadership's thinking, we must also pay attention to breaking the fixed views on activists at all times, and have a moving point of view, and always pay attention to the emergence of new activists in each movement.

    安阳新区群运是怎样开展起来的？
    集体讨论
    孙子英执笔
    一、
    群运前的安阳新解放区，旧的封建统治势力，真象一块千斤的石板，沉重的压在农民的头上，当地群众有四句话生动的描写出过去那里社会的特点：即是“地主集团，恶霸制度”，“黑枪世界，走狗成群。”
    这些农村统治集团，各村都散布着他们的组织如“十二委员”，“八大总管”，“董事会”等。同时他们又利用一批流氓土匪，成立起自己的武装——局子，他们并一贯和敌人伪军，有着密切的勾结，加之安阳又是国民党反动派向我平汉解放区进攻的前锋，国特又专门组织了六七百人的特务武装与本村地主统治集团勾结着，到处以黑枪打击农民翻身积极分子，对农民实行了血腥的武装统治。
    于是，黑枪就成了安阳农民最大的灾难。农民对地主稍不如意，黑枪就会临到他的头上，甚至诛连到亲朋，如该县第十一区，一夜即打死了十五个农民，直接威胁着农民的翻身运动。
    但是，黑枪并没有吓倒群众，农民组织起武装，来保卫了自己的诉苦翻身运动。安阳群运就在这种情况下，逐渐开展起来，据全县七个区统计，四百二十一个自然村中，除四十九村未动外其他连距国民党和伪军三五里的村子群众运动也开展起来了。
    二、
    如下的方法开展了安阳群众轰轰烈烈的翻身运动：
    一、“点大火”和“点小火”：新区大部村庄，群众工作基础，都是较差的，因此如何把群众翻身的烈火燃起来，是个很重要的问题，否则就会徒劳而无成。开初，安阳是走了些弯路的，这是由于领导上强调了斗争的规律，死搬老区经验，主观规定从反贪污反汉奸恶霸入手，（这并不是说不要领导与指出方向）在这里，我们忽略了一个很简单却是最根本的道理：“从群众要求出发”。在实际运动中，才逐渐明确，从群众最普遍最迫切要求下手，最容易把“火”点起来。因为，新区反动势力与反动舆论特别强，一开始抓取广大群众性的问题，最易取得社会同情，减少阻力，若开始从个别问题入手，以影响群众事实上作用不大。西高平经验完全证明这点，起初我们是从解决少数典当问题开始，问题虽解决了几件，但没有打开局面，后来抓住广大群众最痛恨的汉奸恶霸扈子刚进行清算后几天内局面就轰开了。因此开始要“点大火”，才不会使运动为反动气焰所扑灭，“点小火”则运动最容易夭折。
    二、思想上抓紧，行动上“放手”：开初，在干部思想上，并没有解决“放手”的问题。中心关键是干部存在着不相信群众会自己处理问题的思想，他们认为安阳人“滑头”，“易起来不易掌握”。怕出了问题时上级责备。因此第一步必须解决相信群众的问题，同时领导上又必须强调给干部撑腰，只有干部的“手”放开了，才能放开群众的“手”这是决定的关键，但怎样“放手”呢？许多失败的经验中，证明，要行动上“放手”，思想上必须抓紧，只有在思想上把群众的觉悟激发起来了，又明确的给了他们政策作武器，然后再在行动上“放手”让群众干，这样群众才会在行动中充分发挥其创造性。不解决群众思想，只让群众干，认为群众干成啥就是啥，那只会是放弃领导的群众自流行动；不解决思想，在行动上处处代替包办，只能使群众软弱无力，但解决思想，并不是等思想完全解决了才行动，开初只能作一些初步解决，主要是在行动中来教育。
    三、诉苦与算账：发动群众不单要使群众在经济上翻身，而且要在思想上得到解决。农民所受地主的灾害，是一本血泪账，诉苦就是要把记在农民心上的远年账倒出来。算账则是为了使群众明确剥削关系，解决谁依靠谁活的问题，两者是打通群众思想的灵魂，因此必须结合起来进行，只诉苦不算账，就不能把地主对农民的具体剥削清，使农民的阶级自觉意识化，只会流于一种简单的诉苦；同样只算账不诉苦，就不能把地主对农民的具体黑暗揭发出来，农民的斗争热情，就不会更充实有力，地主的情面也不会彻底的撕破。
    四、两种形式与两种方式的配合：为了揭破地主对群众的欺骗，充分使农民理解自己翻身斗争的合理性，有两种方法必须采用：一是自上而下，公开的大规模的向群众做宣传动员，作一般号召，这种方法，在新区群运开始时，特别重要，只有这样才能揭露地主的欺骗，给群众掌腰。一是自下而上的秘密小型的群众活动（这点是由于在边沿区和反动势方强大的缘故——编者）前种方法是给后种方法以便利条件，当自上而下公开的号召动员之后，紧接着便应自下而上的秘密串通，发现问题，组织小型诉苦，到成熟之后，就集中起来走向公开事实证明，两者必须配合进行、不可偏废，开初有些同志，一下到村里，连会也不开，就跑到群众中去串通，群众还不知道是干啥的，结果几天努力，还经不起地主一句破坏话。相反，有些光作了一般公开号召和动员，而不结合自下而上的串通，结果发现不了问题，有的则包办代替了群众。这是粗中有细的一种办法，光“粗”不“细”不能充分发动群众，“光细”不“粗”又不能很快打开局面。当进行了联合斗争局面打开了，群众轰起来之后，这时群众提出的问题复杂了，说理对象多了，然而，这时处理问题就更要讲求细密，使一切问题恰适的解决。
    五、武装与说理相结合问题：安阳群运的特点，不只要说理，还要反黑枪。因为安阳群众的翻身运动，不是在安定的环境中进行，而是在地主反动派内外夹击，明暗联合下进行，在运动中，若无武装保卫，群众胆就不壮，运动就很难开展。因此群众一行动，就强烈的要求武装，甚至不分钱，也要买枪，没有枪就拿手榴弹，群众这种实际行动，是从反对地主阶级斗争中学会的。
    六、群众组织建设问题：——农会。当群众开始起来时，这时组织农会，由于农民之间还存在一种怀疑，特别是许多投机分子，企图乘机混进农会，因此这时群众对参加农会的人，要求是非常严格的，而且纪律非常之严，这是好现象，这正表明群众警惕性之高，这时应是重质不重量，但当群众起来之后，就要放手吸收广大群众进来，这时应是质量并重。
    七、对农民之间问题的解决：在解决农民与地主问题时，农民与农民间的矛盾一般发生较少，有的潜伏着，但到农民与地主问题稍一停顿或缓和时，农民间的问题就出来了，各种不团结的事情就发生了，这大部是由于地主挑拨，或干部徇私自私不民主所致。因此农民之间的问题，应与对地主问题不同，而应采取内部调解的方式去解决。最主要的是引导群众自己反省与洗脸，这样既巩固了农民间的团结，又打击了地主的挑拨离间。只注意解决对地主问题，而不注意解决群众本身团结问题，便会使群众力量松懈，不能有力的组织对地主的说理斗争。
    八、积极分子运用与联系群众问题：积极分子的标准，既要比群众进步，又要不脱离群众，若单纯把积极分子看成是敢干敢说话，忽视了他是否能代表群众，那就会领导形成是少数人的活动，带不起群众来。即使对于真正代表群众的积极分子，当然应大胆运用，相信他们，依靠他们，把群众带起来，但另一方面也应时时刻刻教育他们，克服过去积极分子思想与群众思想的距离，巩固他们和群众的联系，这样领导上才能掌握群众思想，才能经常发现新问题，同时，在领导思想上，也必须时刻注意打破对积极分子的固定观点，而有一种运动的观点，经常注意每一运动中新的积极分子的涌现出来。
