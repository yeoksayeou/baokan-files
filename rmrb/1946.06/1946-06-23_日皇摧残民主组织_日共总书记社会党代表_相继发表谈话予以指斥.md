Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: Tokyo dispatch: The General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, Tokuda Kyuichi, and a representative of the Socialist Party, today issued separate statements regarding the Emperor's order to sabotage democratic organizations. Tokuda pointed out that the Emperor's new order, under the guise of "preventing militarism" and "promoting democracy," attempts to obstruct the implementation of democratic reforms by requiring all members to go through complicated registration procedures with relevant government agencies. Tokuda also declared: "This is an open conspiracy by the Emperor himself, an act of militarism's resurgence." The Socialist Party representative pointed out that the Emperor's order is a means by which the current authorities, like Tojo during the war, are trying to consolidate their power and resorting to repressive measures against the people. It is reported that the Yoshida Cabinet's Ministry of Home Affairs issued an imperial order on the 18th stating: "Based on the instructions of the MacArthur Headquarters regarding the rectification of undesirable organizations, all political organizations not registered with the relevant government agencies will be dissolved." Clearly, MacArthur's claim that "using the Emperor's institution to execute orders and promote democracy" is precisely the opposite; it allows the Emperor's institution to use MacArthur's directives to obstruct democracy.

　　日皇摧残民主组织
    日共总书记社会党代表
    相继发表谈话予以指斥
    【新华社延安二十日电】东京讯：日共总书记德田球一与社会党代表，于本日相继就日皇下令摧残民主组织一事，发表谈话。德田指出：日皇的新命令，是在“防止军国主义”“发扬民主”的借口下，企图使各成员向相当政府机关进行复杂的登记手续，来阻碍实施民主改革。德田并宣称：“这是天皇出面的明目张胆的阴谋，军国主义死灰复燃的行动”。社会党代表则指出：日皇命令，是现今当局力图巩固自己的政权，与东条在战时一样，而采取摧残压迫人民的手段。按吉田内阁内务省于十八日颁布日皇命令说：“根据麦克阿瑟总部关于整顿不良组织的指令，凡一切未在相当政府机关登记的政治组织将被解散”。显然，麦克阿瑟部宣称：“利用天皇机构执行命令与推进民主”云云者，正适得其反，使天皇机构利用麦氏指令，以阻碍民主。
