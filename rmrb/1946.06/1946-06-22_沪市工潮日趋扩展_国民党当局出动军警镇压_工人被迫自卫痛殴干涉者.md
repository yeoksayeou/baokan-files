Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: Shanghai report: Around the time of the "May Thirtieth" anniversary, the labor unrest in Shanghai has expanded further. More than 4,000 unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the Kuomintang-controlled rear areas have petitioned the relevant authorities several times, and on the 24th, their delegation hosted reporters to appeal to society, requesting the authorities to provide them with work and relief. Having received no results, they made another large-scale petition to the Social Affairs Bureau on the 31st. More than 1,000 petitioners participated. When worker representatives began negotiations with the authorities, gatekeepers suddenly prevented several workers in the square from continuing to enter the hall, and loaded their guns, fixed bayonets, sounded sirens wildly, and gathered police officers in the bureau to use force against the workers. They also poured boiling water from the third floor, scalding several workers. The workers were extremely angry and were forced to resist in self-defense, violently beating those who threatened them with force, injuring three police officers and destroying the doors and windows on the third floor. The authorities then dispatched two red police armored vehicles, three jeeps, fifty-five cavalrymen, and more than a hundred armed troops to suppress the workers, surrounding the petitioning workers and setting up machine guns at the entrance, immediately blocking traffic and creating an extremely tense atmosphere. At the time, more than 400 female workers from the China Silk Company were also petitioning on the scene, demanding resumption of work. Under the threat of the military police, they were forced to jump out of windows and doors from the auditorium. Subsequently, Mr. Zhu Xuefan arrived, persuaded the bureau and the workers, and guaranteed to the workers that he would introduce them to employment, accommodate and receive the displaced workers, and discuss with the Ministry of Economic Affairs the opening of cooperative factories, which brought the situation under control. Afterwards, the authorities demanded that the workers write letters of repentance and apologize to the police. On the 25th and 26th, more than 2,000 workers from the footwear industry trade union (leather shoe department) went on strike to demand improved treatment, marching in teams twice to petition the capitalists, the trade union, and the Social Affairs Bureau. On the 27th, more than 80 workers from the Changming Tobacco Factory went to the factory's new plant on Daxilu to eat because the factory had suspended work, and were subjected to oppression by the factory, sparking conflict. On the 26th and 27th, employees of the Shengbingji Department Store angrily announced a strike to protest the capitalists' deduction of wages, instructing labor scabs to intimidate the workers, and dismissing employee Jin. On the 27th, more than 1,000 workers from the handmade canvas industry affiliated with the Third District Cotton Weaving Industry Union also petitioned. In addition, more than 400 employees of the American-owned Texaco Company demanded the abolition of the contracting system and improved treatment, and also went on strike on the 26th because the factory refused to meet with representatives. In addition to these, the factories, companies, and agencies caught up in the labor unrest include China Airlines, the incense candle industry, public utility bureau auto workers, Shanghai Electric Power Company, the Ministry of Transportation Telecommunications Bureau, gas and water companies, British-owned tram companies, Yongde Dyeing and Weaving Factory, China Textile Construction Company, and Jinmen Hosiery Factory.
