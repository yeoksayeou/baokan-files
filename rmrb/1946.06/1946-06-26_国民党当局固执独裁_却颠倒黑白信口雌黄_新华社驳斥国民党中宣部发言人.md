Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 23rd: A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department spokesperson's remarks on the evening of the 21st, stating: This talk completely exposes the Kuomintang authorities' single-minded insistence on dictatorship, and their habitual trick of distorting facts and reversing black and white. This talk was in response to the four resolutions proposed by the CCP delegation to the government. Precisely because the four resolutions proposed by the CCP delegation, such as a long-term ceasefire in the Northeast, represent the public will of the Chinese people and are highly valued by all parties, the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department spokesperson had to hurriedly issue a statement on the same evening. The spokesperson announced his views on the fourth resolution of the CCP delegation (that the government should periodically reopen the Political Consultative Conference through consultation to rapidly resolve the reorganization of the government, guarantee human rights, relieve people's suffering, complete unification, and address various political issues). He believed that "such vague topics, if pursued, would encompass everything, and based on past consultation experience, could drag on for years, with the distance between us only increasing." The Chinese people urgently demand an end to the civil war and the realization of peace. At the same time, the Chinese people urgently demand that, based on the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, one-party dictatorship be stopped, the government be reorganized, human rights be guaranteed, people's suffering be alleviated, democratic unification be achieved, the roots of civil war be eliminated, and peace be consolidated. The Kuomintang officials completely disregard such urgent demands of the Chinese people, dismissing them lightly with the words "vague topics." In particular, regarding the issue of "relieving people's suffering," in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, incomplete statistics from provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Guangxi, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Gansu show that there are nearly one hundred million disaster victims and starving people. Since Japan's surrender, in less than a year, three million two hundred thousand people have starved to death in Hunan province alone. Twenty residents of Guangzhou died of starvation every day, later increasing to sixty or seventy, and sometimes even reaching six hundred. The tragic scene of people living in dire straits and wailing everywhere in the Kuomintang areas is truly what is meant by "encompassing everything"! How eagerly do millions of dying disaster-stricken compatriots need "relief from suffering"? However, the Kuomintang government officials, representing bureaucratic comprador capital, have always been indifferent to the people's suffering. These officials believe that the urgent demands of the Chinese people have no value for negotiation, and they have already made up their minds that if they are forced to negotiate, the distance will only "increase with each discussion." This stubborn attitude of the Kuomintang authorities not only shows that they insist on dictatorship and are unwilling to implement democratic policies for the people's livelihood, but also proves that they have no sincerity for peace. Because their dictatorial policy and civil war policy are inseparable, they are two sides of their entire anti-people policy. According to the January 10th ceasefire agreement, the Truman statement, and the Three-Nation Communiqué, the cessation of civil war in China should be long-term and comprehensive, which is inherently just and indisputable. However, the Kuomintang authorities, using "cannot be delayed" as an excuse, tore up the ceasefire agreement and opposed the long-term and comprehensive cessation of civil war demanded by the people of the country and people around the world.

Xinhua News Agency reporter stated: The Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department spokesperson often uses the habitual trick of distorting facts and reversing black and white, and the last speech was another good example. Shortly after the conclusion of the Political Consultative Conference, the Kuomintang Second Plenary Session immediately passed a resolution selected by the Standing Committee of the Party. Recently, the Kuomintang authorities, without consulting with other parties, independently reorganized the Ministry of National Defense as the supreme command for carrying out large-scale civil war. The Kuomintang authorities insisted on one-party dictatorship and did everything possible to undermine the implementation of the Political Consultative Conference's resolution on government reorganization. This is a fact known to all, and even some senior responsible personnel within the Kuomintang have to say: "The Second Plenary Session was a mistake," and as soon as the Second Plenary Session was held, it became "more and more distant" from the Political Consultative Conference. However, the spokesperson of the Kuomintang authorities, regardless of these facts, still clamored that "the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference on government reorganization could not be implemented because the Communist side created obstacles." The Kuomintang authorities' atrocities of undermining human rights have provoked strong reactions. Shortly after the news spread, from the most recent month alone, seventy-seven newspapers and magazines in Peiping were sealed, and the "police management district system" and "measures for maintaining public security in extraordinary times" in Sichuan have been successively promoted in various places. These facts are also seen by Chinese and foreign people alike; however, the spokesperson of the Kuomintang authorities has his own peculiar logic: closing down media outlets and implementing the "police management district system" are all beautifully called "measures to protect human rights." Therefore, he said that the government not only has "implemented" these "measures to protect human rights," but is also "constantly strengthening" them!

Xinhua News Agency reporter concluded: The Chinese people's level of awareness has been unprecedentedly raised. This trick of the Kuomintang authorities to distort facts and vainly attempt to cover up the eyes and ears of the world will inevitably be abandoned by the people of the whole country.

### 国民党当局固执独裁  却颠倒黑白信口雌黄  新华社驳斥国民党中宣部发言人

　　国民党当局固执独裁
    却颠倒黑白信口雌黄
    新华社驳斥国民党中宣部发言人
    【新华社延安二十三日电】新华社记者评国民党中宣部发言人二十一日晚间谈话称：这谈完全暴陋了国民党当局一意孤行坚持独裁的面目，与信口雌黄颠倒黑白的惯技。这谈话是对二十一日中共代表致政府国而发的。正因为中共代表团中所提出的东北长期停战等四项决议，代表中国人民的公意，极为各方所重视，因而国民党中宣部发言人乃不得不慌忙地于同日晚间，对此事发表谈话。该发言人宣布了他对中共代表团中第四项议议（由政府经协商定期重开政治协商会议，迅速解决改组政府、保障人权、解救民生、完成统一及各项政治问题）的见解，他认为“此等空泛题日，放之则六合，照过去协商经验，恐经年累月，愈谈而距离愈远”，中国人民迫切地要求停止内战实现和平，中国人民同时迫切地要求根据政协决议制止一党专政，改组政府，保障人权，解救民生，实现民主统一，消除内战根源，巩固和平。对于中国人民这样迫切的要求，国民党的大人先生们根本不放在眼里，并用“空泛题目”四个字，轻轻地把它一笔勾销。特别是关于“解救民生”的问题，在国民党统治地区，仅就湘、鄂、粤、赣、川、桂、豫、皖、苏、浙、闽、甘等省的不完全统计，就有将近一万万的灾民饥民。自日本投降以来，不到一年的时间内，湖南一省就饿死了三百二十万人。广州居民每天饿死二十人，后来增至六七十人，有时竟达六百人。国民党地区民不聊生，哀鸿遍野的惨象，真所谓“放之则六合”！千百万奄奄待毙之灾民同胞，是怎样迫不及待地需要“解救民生”，可是代表官僚买办资本的国民党政府的大人先生们，对于人民的痛苦是一向漠视无睹的，这些大人先生们认为中国人民的迫切要求，是没有协商的价值的，他们并已下好决心，如果万一被迫协商，也只有“愈谈而距离愈远”。国民党当局这种顽固态度，不仅说明它坚持独裁，不愿实行民主民生政策，而且也证明了它对和平没有诚意。因为它的独裁政策与内战政策，是不可分离的，是它的整个反人民政策的两面。按照一月十日停战协定、杜鲁门声明和三国公报，中国停止内战应当是长期全面，本来是天经地义无可争论，但国民党当局却以“不能延岩”为借口，撕毁停战协定，反对全国人民和全世界人士所要求的长期的和全面的停止内战。
    新华社记者称：国民党中宣部发言人常以颠倒黑白的惯技，上次讲话又是一个很好的例子。协商会闭幕不久，国民党二中全会，即有刚刚由该党中常会选任之决议，最近国民党当局，不开各党派协议，擅自单独改组国防部，以为进行大规模内战的最高指挥部。国民党当局坚持一党专政。百计破坏政协关于改组政府的决议的施行，此乃众人皆知之事实，连国民党里面的某些高级负责人员也不得不说：“二中全会开错了”，二中全会一开，就和政协“愈离愈远”了。但是，国民党当局的发言人不管这些事实，还是叫嚣着“协商会议关于改组政府之决议，实因共方横生枝节未能实行”。国民党局摧残人权的暴行反应强烈，消息传出不久，即从最近一个月来而看，有北平七十七家报章杂志的被封，有四川的“警管区制”、“非常时期维持治安办法”的相继在各地推行等等，这些事实，也为中外人士所共见；可是国民党当局的发言人，却有他奇特的逻辑，封闭言论机关，实行“警管区制”等等，都美共名为“保障人权办法”，因此他说政府不懂已将这些“保障人权办法”“付请实施”，而且还在“不断加强”哩！
    新华社记者结论称：中国人民的觉悟程度已空前提高了，国民党当局这种颠倒黑白妄图一乎掩盖天下耳目的技俩，无里的将为全国人民所唾弃。
