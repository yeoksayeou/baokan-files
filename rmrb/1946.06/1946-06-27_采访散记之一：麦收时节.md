Random Notes from an Interview: Wheat Harvest Season
    Zhan Chao
    Around midday, the heat was stifling. Even the occasional gusts of southern wind, filled with the scent of new wheat, were scorching hot.

    I walked to the edge of Pian Mountain Village, five miles from Wu'an City, and found a shady spot to rest. A few farmers were already taking shelter there. They greeted me briefly and then continued their cheerful conversation. One of them, a man around fifty or sixty years old, said:

    "Everyone says 'turbulent May,' 'turbulent May'! But this year's May wasn't turbulent at all. This world, it's really..." He was excitedly about to continue, but was interrupted by a strong young man named Liu Jinhe.

    "This year we have food to eat, so of course it's not turbulent," Liu Jinhe said, gesturing with his hands. "In previous years, we had to rely on the children to glean scraps from other people's fields! Since the Eighth Route Army liberated Wu'an last autumn, implementing rent reduction and debt clearing, we got back the eleven and a half mu of land we'd lost. The wife, kids, and I, all four of us, are busy cutting wheat and hoeing cotton. We can barely manage our own fields, let alone have time to pick up wheat in other people's fields?" Wu Qishun, who was standing nearby, said, "That's right." He used to be a middle peasant, but was gradually exploited by the landlords and became addicted to opium. Eventually, he even sold his wife. This year, he quit his addiction. Although he hasn't bought any land yet, his day labor is enough to live on. "Isn't that so?" He waved his white cloth shirt and said, "In previous years, we wouldn't have changed our clothes yet at this time. People wore silk and sat under the trees fanning themselves, still complaining about the heat. We had to wear cotton-padded coats and suffer in the fields for them!..." As soon as he mentioned changing clothes, everyone started talking about their own experiences. Guo Yicang, the twenty-year-old vice chairman of the farmers' association, said:

    "Well, let's not talk about the past. Just thinking about it makes me angry. The landlords exploited us until we were drained dry, and then they said it was our bad luck. 'Turbulent May' was clearly created by them, but they said we poor people didn't follow the rules!" He tried to suppress the anger in his heart and continued, "My family of four didn't have a single room or a single plot of land! My father and brother worked in a paper mill, and I collected coal cinders. When the landlord saw me, he would scold me, saying, 'You're not even worth a dog. A dog guards the door, but you come to pick up my things.' In famine years, they wouldn't even let us pick leaves to eat. They said, 'You outsiders aren't qualified to eat the vegetables from Pian Mountain Village.' As a result, my brother starved to death!" Li Youquan said that on the Dragon Boat Festival that year, the landlord asked him to carry coal. At that time, the price was five yuan per catty, but he wasn't paid. It was only paid at three yuan per catty on the eighth day. "See how they cheat people!" "Damn them!" said Wu Fengqi, the chairman of the labor union. He said slowly and deliberately, "What about us workers? In the past, we worked hard all year round, but we didn't have enough to eat or wear. When it rained, we weren't paid. They forced you to 'borrow wheat accounts' from the landlord. You borrowed at four yuan per catty, but you had to pay back at fifty-five yuan per catty. In the past two years, seventy or eighty hired laborers in our village starved to death while fleeing the famine!" "The most hateful thing is," Li Youjin added, "the local despotic landlords Sun Dapao, Guo Zhengmin, Huo Guifen, Wang Zhen, and Wu Xi, etc., even colluded with the enemy when they came, sending their lackeys Guo Wen to be the traitorous village chief and Wen Zancheng to be the traitorous secretary. They extorted people however they pleased. Last year, the bandit Yang Size demanded six taels of opium per mu of land, and the traitorous district chief Li Maozhai demanded three taels. They allocated it at twenty taels. Just for Yang Size's troop levy (forty-four soldiers were levied, and all households, regardless of size, had to pay 700 yuan per 'door'), they embezzled 800,000 yuan. Countless other funds." "This time, after settling the accounts," Li Youquan said, suddenly raising his voice, "everyone finally breathed a sigh of relief!" The people next to him all nodded in agreement or casually interjected. Suddenly, someone suggested that Wang Jiuchang talk about his suffering, because he had suffered the most from exorbitant taxes. Wang Jiuchang, a strong man in his forties, was squinting and grinning at everyone. He said, "My liberation depends entirely on our labor union, farmers' association, and everyone." He used to be a rich peasant, but he was very honest. As a result, in a cannibalistic society, his own brother Wang Bi and some other local despotic landlords seized his thirty or forty mu of land and a string of good courtyards. Only now, after settling the accounts, did he manage to recover the string of courtyards and five mu of paddy fields. He said that he wouldn't be a hired laborer at his brother's place anymore starting tomorrow. His liberation depends entirely on the labor union, farmers' association, and everyone. "This world is really good. Honest people have finally made it through!" After speaking, Wang Jiuchang took a long drag of his cigarette, sat there, and smiled contentedly.

    Later, they talked about the burden of taxes and levies. "The entire village has about thirty qing of land. Last year, every tael of grain silver cost 11,000 yuan, and eight catties of wheat, four catties of millet, and other miscellaneous items. On average, every mu of land had to produce thousands of catties of grain. This year's burden is even less than the 'lookout money' that was paid in previous years." Wang Tai, a middle peasant, said: "In previous years, this was the time to worry and be afraid, because either the bandit Yang Size would come to rob or the enemy's plainclothes would come to extort money. The most hateful thing was that gang of bloodsuckers in the village who colluded with a group of traitorous captains like Du Erwang in the city, nominally to 'save face,' but actually extorted money during the day and stole at night." Speaking of this, Wu Qishun, who used to be addicted to opium but now had a ruddy complexion, was furious. He said in a low voice, "Poor people rely on a couple of vegetables in the field to get by. How can they wait until the 3rd, 6th, or 9th to 'release silver'?" Because he picked a bag of cowpeas from his own field, Du Erwang saw him and not only confiscated the cowpeas and the cloth bag, but also fined him sixty yuan in ghost money and beat him so badly that he couldn't get out of bed for three days. He was really angry when he mentioned these things. "'Turbulent May,' 'turbulent May,' it's all because of those bloodsuckers!" This year, the wheat is piled up in the threshing ground day and night, and no one dares to touch it. A few days ago, special agents secretly went to throw the militiamen's wheat, but they were caught by the children's corps…

    The weather cooled down a bit. Some people were going to the shade, and some were going to hoe cotton. Li Youquan and a few others invited me to their homes to eat food made from the new wheat. I declined and went to Wu'an City alone. When I climbed the ancient and dilapidated city wall, the city was already lit up with thousands of lights, but people were still winnowing wheat outside the city. In the distance, someone's child was singing "Chairman Mao, like a red lantern on a high mountain..." In this first wheat harvest season after the victory, the newly liberated land was filled with an atmosphere of freedom and joy.
              June 19th, in Baiguan Village, Wu'an

　　采访散记之一：麦收时节
    展潮
    起晌时分，炎热逼人，连偶尔吹起一阵阵充满着新麦香味的南风，也是烫热的。
    我走到离武安城五里地的骈山村边，找到一个荫凉地方休息下来。这里原先就有几个农民在乘凉，见我来了，略略打了打招呼，便又继续他们愉快的谈话。其中有一个五六十岁上下的人说：
    “都说是‘乱五月’，‘乱五月’！今年的五月可没有乱了一点。这世道啊，可真是………”他兴奋着正待要往下说，却被一个叫刘金河的壮年人抢着说了。
    “今年都有吃的了，该不是不乱哩。”刘金河用手比划着说：“往年到这个时候，就得靠孩子们到别人地里捡点吃的！打去年秋天八路军解放咱武安，闹减租清债，把俺丢掉的十一亩半地要回来，孩子老婆一家四口，又是割麦又是锄花，连自己地里活都忙不过来，还有工夫到别人地里拾麦子？”旁边的武其顺说：“就是”。他过去是个中农户，后来被地主们一点点剥削干，又吸上了料面瘾，最后连老婆也卖了，今年瘾也戒了，这回虽还没买地，打短工也够住吃穿了。“这不是”，他扬扬他那件白布衫说：“往年这个时候还没有换上季，人家穿绸缎，坐在树凉下扇扇子还嫌热，咱还得穿棉袄，在地里给人家受！………”一提起换季，大家都抢着说起自己的事来了，二十岁的农会副主任郭义仓说：
    “那，过去的事不要提了，提起来光想冒火，地主们把咱剥削干了，还说咱命不好，‘乱五月’明明是他造下的，还说咱穷人们不守规矩”他努力压抑自己心头的怒火，继续往下说：“俺家四口人，房无半间，地无一垅！俺爹跟俺哥在纸坊里作工，俺拾煤渣，地主看见了还骂说：“你就不抵个狗，狗看门，你却来检俺的东西”，灾荒年摘点树叶吃也不叫，还说：“你们外住户没有资格吃咱骈山村的菜”，结果把俺兄弟给饿死了！”李有全说，那年五月端五，地主叫他驮煤，当时五块钱一斤不给钱，硬顶到八日里三块钱一斤才给钱，“你看坑人不坑人”！“入他姑！”讲话的是工会主任吴凤其，他沉重地一字一拍往下说：“咱们工人们呀？过去一年忙到头，吃不饱，穿不暖，天阴下雨还不给发工钱，逼着你只好向主家‘揭麦帐’，四块钱一斤揭，却要按五十五块钱一斤还。前两年俺村光雇工逃荒饿死的就有七、八十个”！“最可恶的是”，李有金接上说：“村里恶霸地主孙大炮、郭正民、霍贵芬、王珍、吴喜等，敌人来了还勾结上敌人，派狗腿郭文当汉奸保长，温赞成当汉奸书记，高兴怎个讹人就怎个讹，去年土匪杨四则每亩地要六两大烟土，汉奸区长李懋斋要三两，他们却按着二十两派。光杨四则派兵一项（派四十四个兵，不论大小户均得出“门头股”七百元），他们就贪污了八十万块钱，其余款项无数。“这次算了一下帐”，李有全说到这里，突然把嗓子提得很高地说：“大家总算出了口毒气！”旁边的人都同意地点点头，或者随便地插上一两句。这时突然有人提议叫王久常谈谈他的痛苦，因为数他受苛榨得压害，那个叫王久常的，是个四十来岁的壮年人，正在眯着眼睛，裂着嘴对大家笑，他说：“我翻身，全靠咱工会、农会和大家。”他原先是个富农，人很老实，结果在人吃人的社会里，被他亲哥哥王璧和另外一些恶霸地主，把三四十亩地和一串好院子都并走了，这会算账才算把一串院和五亩水地要回来。他说他明天就不在他哥那里当长工了，翻身，全靠工会农会和大家。“这世道真好，老实人算是熬出头了！”讲完话，王久常长长地吸了一口烟，坐在那里，露着满足的笑容。
    后来又谈起负担的事。“全村三十来顷地，去年每两粮银出一万一千块钱八斤麦子四斤谷杂七杂八每亩地平均总得出千数来斤粮，今年的负担却连往年出的看口子钱都不到，中农王台的说：“往年到这正是耽心害怕的时候，不是土匪杨四则来抢，便是敌人便衣来讹诈，最可恨的是村里那伙吸血鬼，到城里勾来一批汉奸队长杜二旺等，名义上是“看面子”，实际上白天讹诈夜里偷。说到这里，那个过去吸料面现在红光满面的武其顺，简直气炸了，却用低沉的声音说：“穷人就指望着地里两棵菜过时光，那能等到三、六、九‘放银子’。他因为到自己地里摘了一袋豆角，被杜二旺看见了，连豆角带布袋扣下还不算，余外还罚了六十块钱鬼票，打得三天下不了炕，提起这些事他真起火。“‘乱五月’‘乱五月’，全乱在他们那些吸血鬼身上！”今年的麦子白天黑夜堆在场子里，也没有人去动他一根。前两天特务分子偷偷去摔民兵的麦子，也被儿童团抓住了，……
    天气稍为凉快了一些，有人要去荫地，有人要去锄花，李有全几个人邀我到他们家里吃新麦做成的饭食，我谢绝了，独自一个人到武安城。登上古老颓废了的城墙时，城里已是万家灯火了，但城外还有人在扬着麦子。远处不知谁家的孩子又在唱着“毛主席，好比那高山红灯……”这胜利后第一个麦收时节，在新解放的土地上，到处洋溢着自由欢快的气息。
              六月十九日于武安柏官村
