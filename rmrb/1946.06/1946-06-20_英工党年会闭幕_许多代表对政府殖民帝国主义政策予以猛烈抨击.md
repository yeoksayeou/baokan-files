Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: According to Reuters, the British Labour Party Annual Conference in Portsmouth closed on the morning of the 14th. Before its close, the conference held a fierce debate on the British government's colonial imperialist policies. The debate was triggered by Professor Gatlin's proposal concerning India, who had just returned from there. Gatlin's proposal demanded that the government clearly declare the principles of the Asia Charter, abolish Britain's financial exploitation of the people of the Eastern colonies, and affirm the right of the people of the East, regardless of color or race, to fully bear their national responsibilities. When Ms. Ennilin Dunnington spoke, she vehemently criticized British colonial policy, stirring the entire venue. She said: "Millions upon millions of people are crying out for freedom, and the responsibility lies with us. Attlee has said that British imperialism is dead, but the empire still exists. Since the Labour Party came to power, rhinoceros-hide whip floggings have been established in Trinidad in the West Indies, and in Kenya (East Africa), another five hundred white people have immigrated inland, expelling four thousand natives who had houses, schools, and churches built inland, and forcibly seizing their land. In Rhodesia (Southern Africa), 1.6 million natives live in abject poverty and slavery, and it was not until September of last year that the British government agreed to order the forced segregation of natives into isolated residential areas. The Lord Privy Seal, Greenwood, speaking on behalf of the government, tried his best to defend against Ms. Dunnigton's condemnations and demanded that the conference withdraw Gatlin's proposal. Many representatives opposed Greenwood's speech, but Gatlin's proposal was ultimately withdrawn. Laski expressed regret that the conference had failed to discuss the primary issue of India.

    英工党年会闭幕
    许多代表对政府殖民帝国主义政策予以猛烈抨击
    【新华社延安十六日电】据路透社讯：在朴茨茅斯举行之英工党年会，已于十四日晨闭幕。闭幕前，年会对英政府之殖民帝国主义政策，曾举行激烈辩论。辩论系由刚从印度归来的加特林教授的有关印度的提案而引起。加特林的提案要求政府明确声明亚细亚宪章的原则，废除英国对东方殖民地人民的财政剥削关系，确定东方人民不分肤色种族均有充分负担其民族责任之权利恩尼林·邓宁顿女士发言时，对英殖民地政策痛加抨击，激动整个会场。他说：“千千万万的人们正在为自由呼号，而责任却在我们身上。艾德礼曾说英国帝国主义已经死灭，但是帝国却依然存在，自工党上台以来，在西印度群岛的特里尼达已成立了犀牛皮鞭的笞刑，而肯尼亚（东菲）则又有五百白人移民内地，而将在内地建有住宅、学校、教堂的四千土人逐出家园，而强占其土地。在罗德西亚（南菲），有一百六十万土人过的是赤贫的奴隶生活，直到去年九月才得英政府同意，下令强使土人在隔离的居住区居住。掌玺大臣格林伍德代表政府作答时，对邓女士的谴责极力加以辩解，并要求会议撤回加特林的提案。许多代表反对格林伍德的发言，但加氏提案竟被撤消。拉斯基对会议未能讨论印度的首要问题表示遗憾。
