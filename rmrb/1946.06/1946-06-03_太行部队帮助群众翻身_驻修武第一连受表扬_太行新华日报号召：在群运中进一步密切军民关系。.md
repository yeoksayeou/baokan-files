    【This newspaper's dispatch from Jiaozuo】 The Third Military Subdistrict of Taihang recently issued a circular commending the First Company of Unit 1543 for helping the masses to overturn their lives. Since the company was stationed in XX village, Xiuwu, it first used its armed forces to protect and support the mass movement to overturn their lives. When the villagers were afraid of being killed by die-hard troops and special agents and dared not return home, the company immediately proposed "Swear to protect the people," calling on the masses to return home and guaranteeing their safety. The company's political instructor personally went deep among the masses, told them stories, understood their pain, helped solve their problems, and established close relations with them. Secondly, they helped the village organize the militia. The soldiers taught the militia how to clean and use guns, gave them hand grenades, helped them establish joint defense, checked household registrations, and captured fifteen special agents and spies. As a result, the company received the sincere support of the local masses.
    【Another dispatch】 Taihang Xinhua Daily recently published an editorial entitled "Further Consolidate the Relationship Between the Army and the People on the Basis of Boldly Mobilizing the Masses." The editorial stated: "The troops' participation in the mass movement last winter and this spring has achieved many results. Soldiers returning home to participate in the struggle to overturn their lives not only helped the mass movement but also raised their own awareness, thereby further consolidating the troops." It then pointed out: In the mass movement, it is necessary to take care of the families of soldiers and ensure that poor families of soldiers are the first to benefit, and help them establish their livelihoods. Commanders and fighters in the troops should persuade their families to become models in implementing policies and laws, and automatically implement rent reduction and interest rate reduction. Problems of the masses concerning them should be resolved as much as possible through mediation. Experience has proven that the troops' active assistance to the masses in overturning their lives can not only eliminate the estrangement between the army and the people but also consolidate the troops' fighting will, making the troops even more the protectors of the mass movement.

    太行部队帮助群众翻身
    驻修武第一连受表扬
    太行新华日报号召：在群运中进一步密切军民关系。
    【本报焦作讯】太行第三军分区，日前通令表扬帮助群众翻身的一五四三部队第一连。该连自进驻修武××村后，首先以自己的武装力量，保卫与支撑了群众的翻身运动，村里老百姓怕顽军特务杀害，不敢回家，该连即提出“誓死保护老百姓”，号召群众回家，保证他们安全。连队的政指亲身深入群众，给群众讲故事，了解群众的痛苦，帮助解决，和群众建立了亲切的关系。其次是帮助村里组织民兵，战士们教给民兵擦枪用枪的办法，送给他们手溜弹，帮助他们建立联防，清查户口，并查获了特务探子十五人。因之，该连得到了当地群众极真诚的拥护。
    【又讯】太行新华日报，日前曾以“在放手发动群众的基础上，进一步巩固军队与人民的关系”为题发表社论。该社论称：“去冬今春部队参加群运，取得不少成绩，战士回家参加翻身斗争，不仅帮助了群运，而且提高了自己的觉悟，因而也就更加巩固了部队。”继即指出：在群运中必须照顾抗属，保证贫苦抗属首先获得利益，并帮助他们建立家务。部队中的指战员，应说服自己家庭，成为执行政策法令的模范，自动实行减租减息，群众对他们的问题则应尽量采取调解方式。经验证明，部队积极帮助群众翻身，不仅可以消除军队与人民的隔阂，而且可以巩固部队的战斗意志，使部队更加成为群众运动的保护者。
