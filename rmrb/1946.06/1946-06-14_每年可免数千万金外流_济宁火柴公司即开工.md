    Tens of Millions in Gold Outflow Can Be Avoided Annually
    Jining Match Company to Commence Operations
    [Ji-Lu-Yu, 8th dispatch] The Jining Zhenye Match Co., Ltd. is about to commence operations with the help of the democratic government. This company was founded between the 5th and 6th years of the Republic of China (1916-1917). Due to the preparation of houses, machines, and raw materials, it did not officially commence operations until the 8th year of the Republic of China (1919). This is the first branch of the Jinan Zhenye General Company; the second branch is located in Qingdao. At that time, the total capital of the three companies was approximately one million yuan, with more than 300 shareholders. The capital of this company was approximately 250,000 yuan, with more than 300 houses and 26 machines. After Jining was occupied by the enemy and puppets, most of them were destroyed, forcing the factory to shut down. Currently, only ten machines are relatively complete. The company currently has approximately 168 workers, in addition to approximately 400 mobile workers who specialize in packaging. Most of the poor citizens around the factory rely on pasting matchboxes for a living. Therefore, the workers inside and outside the company, as well as the nearby poor people, are all hoping that the two towering chimneys will soon emit smoke. The government is now vigorously supporting the company, trying to commence operations as soon as possible to supply the needs of matches in various liberated areas. This will avoid the outflow of tens of millions of funds every year.

    每年可免数千万金外流
    济宁火柴公司即开工
    【冀鲁豫八日电】济宁市振业火柴有限公司，在民主政府帮助下即将开工，该公司创办于民国五、六年间，因筹设房子、机器、原料，直到民国八年才正式开工。这里是济南振业总公司的第一分公司，第二分公司设于青岛，当时三公司资本共计约一百万元，股东三百余家，本公司资本约二十五万元，房子三百余间，机器共有二十六部，敌占济宁后，大部分被敌伪破坏只得停工，现仅有十部机器较完整。现该公司共有工人约一百六十八名，另外还有流动工人约四百余人，专做包装工作，在厂外周围的贫苦市民，大部以糊火柴盒为生，所以该公司内外工人及附近贫民，都盼着那两个耸立的大烟筒马上喷出烟来。政府现正大力资助该公司，设法早日开工，供给解放区各地火柴之需。每年将可避免数千万资金外流。
