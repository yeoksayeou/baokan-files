Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 11th: TASS, Montevideo: The Uruguayan capital newspaper "El Debate" has published a series of articles criticizing the U.S. Pan-American military cooperation plan, calling it North American imperialism's attempt to turn South America into a source of bases and cannon fodder. The paper also stated that the United States is attempting to use the Chapultepec economic agreement to hinder competitors in the South American market (Note: referring to Britain). The paper pointed out that although there is absolutely no danger threatening the Americas, the United States, without the consent of other countries, has announced that it will distribute various weapons to various places, even though no country has requested such weapons.
