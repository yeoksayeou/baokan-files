    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 22nd - Nehru, leader of the Indian National Congress, who was arrested by the Kashmir State authorities on the 20th, was released on the 21st amidst public protests, according to a New Delhi broadcast monitored in London. It is reported that after the news of Nehru's arrest, approximately 100,000 workers in Bombay responded to the call of the National Congress leaders for a city-wide strike, holding a protest strike on the 21st. Bombay City was therefore paralyzed. Tram and bus traffic in Calcutta also came to a standstill on the same day. In demonstrations in Madras in southern India, police used tear gas, causing several injuries. Pro-National Congress newspapers have fiercely criticized the actions of the Kashmir State authorities. The Hindustan Times even called the action a "mad act." The National Congress Executive Committee meeting has been postponed by the party chairman, Asaf Ali. At the same time, all political negotiations with the British delegation regarding the interim government have been suspended. Several members of the Indian League affiliated with the Labour Party in the British Parliament protested in the House of Commons on the 21st regarding Nehru's arrest.
