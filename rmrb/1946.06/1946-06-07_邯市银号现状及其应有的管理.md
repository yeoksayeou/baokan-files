    The city of Handan currently has six silver firms, with a total capital of 6.8 million yuan. One has 2 million yuan, four have around 1 million yuan, and one has less than 1 million yuan. The firm with the most employees has ten people, and the firm with the fewest has six. Historically, three firms are re-established from old foundations, and three are newly established. The re-establishment and new establishment times are early March for two firms, early May for two firms, mid-May for one firm, and late May for one firm. In nature, they are completely private, with capital raised by private shareholders, predominantly merchants, and all jointly operated by one, two, or more families. Their main business is deposits and loans, with only a few engaging in foreign exchange in other areas. Trading in gold, silver, and securities is only legal with the special permission of the Jinnan Bank. Their business customers include large, medium, and small merchants, with medium-sized merchants being the majority. Their office hours are not restricted; they engage whenever someone seeks their services. If you borrow and repay on the same day, you may not even have to pay interest, which merchants find very convenient. Therefore, silver firms have a relatively high reputation among merchants.

    Although the operating time of the silver firms is very short (the longest does not exceed three months, and most are less than one month), their development is rapid. In terms of capital: In early March, two silver firms had a total capital of 900,000 yuan, averaging 450,000 yuan each. Now, there are six firms, with capital increased to 6.8 million yuan, averaging over 1.13 million yuan each, a two and a half-fold increase in one month. In terms of business, in the March summary, the two firms absorbed 1.47 million yuan in deposits and issued 4.62 million yuan in loans. In April, still with two firms, deposits absorbed were 9.8 million yuan and loans issued were 8.1 million yuan. In May, the six firms combined saw a sharp increase in both deposits absorbed and loans issued, with the former being 98.93 million yuan and the latter being 42.27 million yuan. This means that in three months, loans increased nine-fold, and deposits increased a massive sixty-seven-fold. One silver firm, which has added foreign exchange business in other areas, has issued 30.066 million yuan in legal currency drafts to other areas, which is a remarkable figure.

    The Jinnan Bank has exerted significant effort to assist in the development of these businesses, especially in providing initial capital assistance. Before March, due to obstructed transportation in various areas, underdeveloped industry and commerce in the market, and insufficient numbers of businesses opening, merchants did not fully understand the policies of the democratic government. Therefore, the silver firms, newly opened, could not attract deposits and faced significant funding difficulties. At that time, in order to support the development of silver firms and enable them to play a certain role in the market, the Jinnan Bank, in addition to providing assistance through various propaganda and organizational efforts, especially provided substantial capital assistance to the silver firms, allowing the two silver firms to overdraft (long-term borrowing from the bank after depositing funds) up to more than 4 million yuan, accounting for more than five times their original capital, with very low interest rates, some even interest-free. Now, with the development of business, the activities of the silver firms are quite extensive, capable of widely absorbing deposits and replenishing their own operating funds. Generally speaking, such overdraft subsidies are not as urgently needed as before. By the end of May, statistics showed that only two of the six silver firms had overdrafts from the Jinnan Bank, and the amount was small, only about 1 million yuan. The profit situation of the silver firms does not have complete data, only rough statistics from two firms show that they earned a total of 100,500 yuan in March, 53,000 yuan in April, and a sudden increase to 460,000 yuan in May. Taking March as 100, April accounted for 50.5 percent, and May accounted for 438.1 percent; in a short three-month period, profits increased more than fourfold. What does this illustrate? It shows that it is entirely possible to cultivate silver firms to operate independently and develop towards private capitalism.

    There are many reasons why silver firms can develop so quickly. The obvious ones are: (1) They have a certain existing credit base in the market, and merchants generally believe they are reliable. For example, if acquaintances go to borrow money, they don't even need to write a contract, and the procedures are very simple. (2) They are beneficial for merchants to adjust their funds. Funds that are not needed can be deposited to earn interest, and funds that are immediately needed can be withdrawn (current account with instant access). As mentioned above, if loans are borrowed and repaid on the same day, they may not even have to pay interest. (3) They provide very attentive service, with no restrictions on office hours, allowing transactions and procedures to be discussed and handled at any time. In addition, their speaking style is very casual, they can get along easily in terms of customs, and merchants generally have the idea that "it's easier to get things done through acquaintances," so they don't feel out of place. Therefore, we should not be surprised that the business of silver firms is so active. One silver firm has made more than 200 transactions in one day (usually between 120 and 140 transactions). This further illustrates that silver firms not only have a certain role in the market but also have certain development conditions and foundations.

     Originally, silver firms were a product of the old society. In feudal society, they had a strong feudal nature. The most important characteristic was manifested in their high-interest exploitation. The silver firms in Handan were the same. For example, in the past, there was a production of hatching chicks here, where the profit was not high, but the silver firms would not lend money to it. Instead, they adopted the method of investment, with a 30/70 profit split. If they earned 100 yuan, the silver firms would get 70 yuan, and the chick hatcher would only get 30 yuan. The interest on commercial loans was also very high. It is said that at the highest point, merchants would pay 18 yuan per day for borrowing 1,000 yuan, which, when converted to monthly interest, would be 0.54 yuan per yuan, nine times higher than the current highest commercial loan monthly interest rate of 0.06 yuan offered by the Jinnan Bank. The general interest rate was 8 yuan per day per 1,000 yuan, which, when converted to monthly interest, would be 0.24 yuan per yuan, six times higher than the highest commercial loan interest rate of 0.06 yuan offered by the Jinnan Bank. This is one point. Secondly, during the enemy's rule, the silver firms also had a large comprador nature. Here is an example: In order to plunder cotton, the enemy established 38 cotton agent stores in Handan. The enemy relied on the agent stores to plunder cotton, and the silver firms played a significant supporting role in the turnover of funds. The agent stores could monopolize everything in the market, and the silver firms played some bad roles in this regard. Therefore, we say that silver firms had a comprador nature in a certain period. Thirdly, the silver firms themselves had a large speculative nature. They could engage in market operations or commercial investments, and they could manipulate prices, hoarding during normal times and selling when prices soared. As a result, the market would be greatly negatively affected. Generally speaking, all of these are things of the past. In today's Handan city, under the implementation of the policies of the democratic government, the silver firms have undergone many transformations, such as not concurrently engaging in commerce, not hoarding goods, not engaging in commercial investment, and appropriately reducing loan interest rates to the highest standard: a monthly interest rate of 0.09 yuan, which are all different from the past. To some extent, the silver firms today still have a capitalist operating nature in the market. This is mainly because their capital is not entirely invested by feudal landlords, but more by commercial capital.

    However, the current business of silver firms still has some problems, such as secretly engaging in unauthorized businesses and semi-openly conducting things that are not permitted by law, which are all worth paying attention to in the future. In order to further standardize the business of silver firms and enable them to play a greater role in the market, I believe that it is necessary to formulate certain measures to appropriately manage the silver firms. The basic principle should be to take care of and develop their capitalist economy, eliminate and weaken their feudal and comprador nature, and prevent their speculation, manipulation, or even monopoly in the market. Specifically:

    (1) The positive significance of managing silver firms lies in enabling them to develop further and serving to promote the prosperity of industry and commerce in the liberated areas. Therefore, when formulating certain measures to manage silver firms, in addition to paying attention to weakening their feudal and comprador nature, it is more important to provide appropriate care for private capital, so that it can develop well. This is beneficial for invigorating finance and promoting industrial and commercial undertakings.

    (2) Regarding the business aspects of silver firms, they can be divided into three categories based on the situation: (1) businesses that are permitted to operate, (2) businesses that are permitted to operate only after special permission, and (3) businesses that are not permitted to operate. The first and third categories can be generally applied. The second category can be determined by the Jinnan Bank based on the creditworthiness of the silver firm, its ability to implement policies, the size of its activities, the amount of idle funds it can unite, whether its capital is sufficient, and whether its personnel are reliable, and determine whether to grant special permission for a business or a certain degree of business.

    (3) Currently, silver firms generally only want to make commercial loans and are unwilling to make industrial loans. The reason is very simple: the latter's profits are small. Of course, it is impossible to demand too much in the city all at once, and agricultural loans should be avoided as much as possible, but it is absolutely necessary to require them to make certain industrial loans to cooperate and help the development of industrial production, and in doing so, they cannot be allowed to do as they please. A certain proportion must be set for the allocation of amounts, and the interest rate should be slightly lower than that for commercial loans. On the basis of what they can do, slightly increase the requirements when stipulating them.

    (4) In a market, based on the size of the population, whether transportation is convenient, and whether industry and commerce are prosperous, the minimum capital amount of the silver firm can be appropriately stipulated. Generally speaking, it cannot be too small (that is, the number of silver firms should not be too many), because this is related to its creditworthiness. If it is too small, it will not only not be able to operate but also its credit will not be easily consolidated, which will affect its business development.

    Finally, the standard for measuring the quality of the work of silver firms should be measured by the amount of private capital united, the size of activities in the market, the communication of relationships with other areas, and the extent of contribution to the economic construction of the liberated areas, not other conditions. Therefore, we should support them so that they can operate independently, with little or no reliance on the bank, or even the idea of living off the bank. In addition to providing necessary financial assistance to silver firms under certain conditions, banks should spend more time and energy studying the business of silver firms and providing guidance and assistance in their operations so that they can operate independently and grow stronger. Secondly, they should be made aware of the importance of deposit and loan work and attach importance to this work, because this work is the basic work in the financial work of the liberated areas. Only mainly through this work, in coordination with other forces, can the industry and commerce of the liberated areas develop more rapidly, and the market will truly prosper. Only with the true prosperity of the market can the business foundation of the silver firms be truly consolidated.

    邯市银号现状及其应有的管理
    王静然
    邯郸市现有六家银号，资金总额六百八十万元。其中二百万元者一家，一百万元左右者四家，不足一百万元者一家。柜上用人最多的十人，最少的六人。按历史上说三家是旧底子重新复业的，三家是新设立的。复业和新设立的时间三月上旬两家，五月上旬两家，五月中旬一家，下旬一家。性质上完全是私营，资金是由私人集股而成，以商人居绝对多数，都是一两家或三家以上合干的。他们的业务最主要的是存款和放款，只有个别的经营外区汇兑。生金银有价证券买卖，是必须经过冀南银行特许委托才算合法的，他们营业上的顾客，大、中、小商人都有，以中等商人居多数。他们的办公时间，没有限制，什么时间有人去照顾，什么时间就接洽，你要是当天借款当天还的话，还可以不出利息，商人们都感到很方便，因此银号在一般商人中的威信是相当高的。
    银号的经营时间虽很短（最长的不超出三个月，大多数都还不超过一个月），但是发展的却很快，从资金上说：三月上旬两家银号共有资金九十万元，每家平均是四十五万元，到现在增为六家，资金变为六百八十万元，每家平均一百一十三万元强，占一月的二倍半。从业务上看，在三月份总结时，两家共吸收存款一百四十七万元，放款四百六十二万元；四月份还是两家，吸收存款九百八十万元，放款八百一十万元；五月份的六家合计起来，不论吸收存款或放款，都有急剧的增加，前者是九千八百九十三万元，后者是四千二百二十七万元，这就是说，三个月中间，放款发展了九倍，吸收存款发展了六十七倍之巨。一家银号增营的外区汇兑业务上，向外区开出了三千零六百六十万元的法币汇票，这实在是一个了不起的数目。
    在这些业务的开展上，冀南银行是用了较大的力量给予了帮助的，特别是最初在资金上的帮助，三月份以前，由于各地交通不能畅通，市面上工商业不够发达，买卖家开门还不够多，商人们对民主政府政策还不十分了解，因此银号才开张营业，吸收不了存款，资金十分困难，当时冀南银行为了扶助银号发展，使其在市面上起一定的作用，除了结合各方面的宣传组织工作给予帮助之外，尤其在资金上对银号的帮助颇大，准许两家银号透支（经过存款后长支银行款）数达四百余万元之多，占他们原有资金的五倍有余，利息很低，有的甚至无息。现在呢，业务发展起来了，银号的活动面相当大，能够广泛吸收存款，充裕了自己的活动资金，一般的说，这种透支补助，不如以前要求的急迫了。五月底统计，六家银号中只有两家在冀南银行透支款，而且数目很小，才只一百万元的样子。银号的盈利情形，没有完整的材料，只据两家的粗略统计，三月份共赚十万零五千元，四月份五万三千元，五月份突增至四十六万元，以三月份作一百的话，四月份占百分之五十点五，五月份占百分之四百三十八点一；三个月的短短过程，利润增加了四倍以上。这说明了什么问题呢？说明了培养银号独自经营使之向私人资本主义道路上发展，完全是可能的。
    银号能很快发展的原因很多，明显可以看到的，大体上有：（一）在市场上有一定的旧有信用基础，一般商人认为靠得住，如熟人去贷款，连契都无须写，手续很简便。（二）商号调剂资金上有好处，款子用不着，即可以去存上生利息，马上需要款，又可以去取（活存活取），如果贷款当天借当天还的话，上面已说过，还可以不出利息。（三）照顾很周到，办公时间不限制，什么时间也可以谈交易，办手续，再加上说话很随便，习惯上又能相处，以及商人们一般都是“熟人好办事”的思想，使其没有格格不入的感觉。因此，我们就不会奇怪银号业务上为什么那么活跃了。有一家银号一天中作过二百多种交易。（平常均在一百廿宗至一百四十宗）这里又说明了银号在市场上不仅有他一定的作用，而且有它一定的发展条件和基础。
     本来银号是旧社会的一种产物，在封建社会中，它有浓厚的封建性，最重要的特点，是表现在它的高利盘剥上。邯郸的银号也同样，例如过去这里有一种孵小鸡的生产，利润本来就不大，但是银号不予贷款，而采取投资的方式，按三七分红，赚一百元钱的话，银号得七十元，孵小鸡者只能得卅元。对商业贷款利也很高，据说最高时，商人们借一千元每天出过十八元，如以月息合，每元即出五角四，比冀南银行目前最高的商业放款月息六分高出九倍之多，一般的利息，都是每千元每天出八元，以月息合，每元是二角四，比冀南银行商业放款最高息六分也高出六倍之多，这是一点。其次，敌人统治时，银号又有很大的买办性，这里可以举出一个例子：敌人为了掠夺棉花，在邯郸设立了三十八个棉花代理店，敌人就靠代理店进行棉花掠夺，而银号在款子的运用周转上，却有很大的扶助作用，代理店在市场上可以垄断一切，银号在这方面，是起了一些坏作用的。因此我们说银号在一定时期是具有买办性的。再其次，银号本身又有很大的投机性，它可以在市场上经营或商业投资，在价格上可以操纵起来，平时屯集，物价高涨时出售，这样的结果，市场会跟随着受很大的坏影响。以上这些，一般的说，都是过去的事情了，在今日民主政府政策实施下的邯郸市，银号已有了许多改造，诸如不兼营商业，不屯集货物，不进行商业投资，以及适当的降低贷款利息至最高标准：月息九分等等，都是与过去不同的。在某种程度上说，今天银号在市场上，还带有资本主义的经营性质，这主要由于它的资本不完全是封建地主的资本投入，而更多的却是商业资本投入而形成的。
    但目前的银号业务，还存在着一些问题，诸如未经特许的业务，偷偷摸摸经营，法令不许可的事情，半明半暗的进行等等，都是值得今后注意的。为了更进一步使银号业务走上正规化，在市场上起更大的作用起见，我认为有订定一定办法，对银号加以适当管理的必要，其基本原则应该是照顾发展其资本主义经济，取缔削弱其封建性和买办性，防止其在市场上的投机，操纵甚或垄断作用。分别来说：
    （一）管理银号的积极意义。在于能使银号更进一步发展，为促进解放区的工商业繁荣而服务。因此在订定一定办法对银号加以管理时，除了注意削弱其封建性买办性之外，更重要的要对私人资本方面，予以适当照顾，使其很好发展，这对活泼金融促进工商事业上是有好处的。
    （二）对银号的业务方面，可分别情况划分为（１）准许经营之业务，（２）经过特许才准经营之业务，（３）不准经营之业务等三种。第一种第三种可一般运用，第二种可视该银号的信用程度，能否执行政策，活动能力的大小，团结游资的多寡，资金额数是否充裕以及人员是否可靠等，由冀南银行掌握，酌情决定是否特许业务或特许一定程度的业务。
    （三）现在银号一般的习惯都是只愿意作商业放款，不愿意作工业放款，原因很简单，后者利润小。当然在城市一下子要求太高，也办不到，农业放款尽可能不要求它去放，但规定它作一定项目的工业放款，以配合帮助工业生产的发展，我以为是完全必要的，并且在作时还不能听其自流，在分配额数上一定有个比例，利息上比商业低若干，在他们能作到的基础上，在规定时，予以略微的提高即可。
    （四）在一个市场上，根据人口的多寡，交通是否便利，工商业是否繁荣等，可适当规定银号的起码资金数，一般的说不能太小（也就是说，银号家数不宜太多），因为这与它的信用是有关系的，小了不仅作不开，而且信用不易巩固，反而会影响其业务的开展。
    最后关于测量银号工作的好坏标准，应以团结私人资本的多寡，在市场上活动能力的大小，沟通外区关系，对解放区经济建设上有多大的贡献等条件来衡量，不是其他。因此我们应该扶助他们，使之能独立经营，不存在或少存在专门依靠银行的思想甚或吃银行的思想，银行对银号，除了在一定条件下必要时的资金帮助外，应以较多的时间、精力来研究银号的业务，在经营上予以指导帮助，使其独立经营，发展壮大。其次应该让他们了解存款放款工作的重要性，把这种工作重视起来，因为这种工作是解放区金融工作中的基本工作，以银号来说，只有主要的通过这种工作，配合其他方面的力量，使解放区的工商业更迅速的发展起来，市场才会真正的繁荣，有了市场的真正繁荣，银号的营业基础，才能真正的巩固。
