    After Pay Increases for Shop Assistants in Xingtai City
    Owners and Staff Work Together to Improve Business
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The Xingtai City Shop Employees Union currently has 1,135 members, all of whom have received wage increases and improved benefits. The pay increase standards are: apprentices should have enough to clothe themselves, and shop assistants should be able to support one person in addition to clothing themselves. There is also occupational security and freedom of speech, learning, and assembly. After the wage increases, the shop assistants also voluntarily proposed six guarantees: 1. When serving customers at the counter, they will not have bad habits or improper behavior. 2. They will work diligently to develop business and will not be passive or slack. 3. They will study business and improve their business abilities. 4. They will not have an arrogant attitude under the pretext of freedom of speech. 5. They will abide by the reasonable rules of the store. 6. If there are mistakes, they will humbly accept criticism from the manager. Before the wage increase, Dong Zengkui, the owner of the Huashi Street Mirror Shop, only made two mirror frames a day. After the wage increase, he increased his production to five or six per day. Lu Qingchen, a shop assistant at the East Street Rope Shop, said: "In the past, I only put out five or six parts of my twelve parts of strength, but now I put out all twelve parts. Whenever I have free time, I automatically work, and I spin much more rope than before." Zhao Qi, a shop assistant at a grocery store, has worked very hard since being elected chairman of the Huashi Street Shop Employees Union. Shop assistants generally have increased their sense of responsibility and initiative for the business of their stores. As soon as there is a change in market prices, the shop assistants report back without waiting for the manager to send them. The manager also discusses matters with the shop assistants more often and respects their opinions, so they can earn more money, and the relationship between the two sides is becoming increasingly harmonious. Shang Zhensan, the manager of Jinxing Paint Store, said: "Increasing wages is really a good way to boost the energy of the shop assistants, and business is becoming more prosperous." However, there are also individual shop assistants who do not show enough respect for the manager after the wage increase and sneak out to watch plays under the pretext of attending meetings. The Shop Employees Union is already conducting education among the workers to correct this tendency. In order to strengthen the unity between owners and staff and develop industry and commerce, the standards for model shop assistants have been discussed, and a model shop assistant campaign will be further launched.

    邢台市店员增资后
    东伙协力做好买卖
    【本报讯】邢市店员工会现有会员一千一百三十五人，均已增加工资，改善待遇。增资标准是学徒够穿，伙友除够穿外能养活一口人，有职业保障及言论学习集会等自由。增资后店员也自动提出六大保证：一、在柜上服务，不得有不良嗜好及不正当行为。二、勤劳发展营业，不得消极怠工。三、学习业务，提高自己营业能力。四、不可因言论自由，有傲慢态度。五、遵守店内合理规则。六、如有错误，应虚心接受经理批评。花市街镜子铺董增奎增资前每天只做两个镜框，增资后每天增加到五个至六个。东街纺绳铺店员卢庆臣说：“过去我十二分力气只拿出五六分，现在十二分都拿出来了。一有空就自动干，纺的绳比过去多得多。”杂货铺店员赵起，当选为花市街店员工会主席之后，工作非常努力。店员普遍的对本店营业提高了责任心与自动性。市面上价格一有变动，不用等经理派，店员就回来报告了，经理遇事也多与店员商量，尊重店员意见，因此更能赚钱，双方关系日益融洽。晋兴颜料庄经理尚珍三说：“增资真是个好办法，把店员的劲都提起来，买卖也更发财了。”但是也有个别店员，增资后对经理尊重不够，借口开会，偷着出去看戏。店员工会已在工人中进行教育，纠正此种偏向。为加强东伙团结，发展工商业，讨论了模范店员标准，将进一步开展模范店员运动。
