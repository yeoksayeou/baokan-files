Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th. The American reactionaries' aiding of the Kuomintang authorities in expanding the Chinese civil war has aroused anxiety among some newspapers in the United States, all hoping for an immediate ceasefire and the realization of peace. According to a US Information Service dispatch from New York on the 4th: The New York Herald Tribune published a commentary on the 2nd, appealing to Chinese leaders to strive for peace, and stating: "No matter which side currently has the advantage, if the Chinese continue to kill each other, any time is a bad time. But if peace can be achieved, any time is a good time." Martin, a special correspondent for the New York Post, telegraphed from Peiping to New York on March 31st, criticizing the Kuomintang warmongers for being unwilling to make peace, stating: "The die-hards of the Kuomintang believe that the Manchurian issue should not be discussed. There is now a new tone in the voices of the Kuomintang members, which is a tone inclined to infighting." The phrases "puppet regime" and "illegal military situation" have been used as tools to apply to the Communists in Manchuria. On the surface, the Kuomintang seems to want to use its military gains as a springboard for forcibly expanding its power in Manchuria, rather than negotiating a comprehensive solution beforehand.

    美国舆论谴责国民党好战分子
    【新华社延安九日电】美国反动派助长国民党当局扩大中国内战，已引起美国内若干报纸的焦虑，咸望立即停战，实现和平。据美新闻处纽约四日电：纽约先驱论坛报二日著评，吁请中国领袖努力争取和平，并称：“不论在任何一方面在目前已占优势，若中国人自相残杀之情形继续不已，则任何钟点，均为恶劣之钟点。但如能获至和平，则任何钟点均为良好之钟点。”纽约邮报特派员马丁，三月三十一日自北平去电纽约，抨击国民党好战分子不愿和平称：“国民党之顽固分子，认为满洲问题不应加以讨论。国民党员之声喉中，现已具有一种新音调，此乃偏于倾轧之语调”。“伪政权”及“非法军事形势”等字句，已被用作加置于满洲方面共产党之工具。就表面观之，国民党似欲利用其军事之收获，作为武力扩展其在满洲权力之跳板，而不愿对以前整个的解决办法进行谈判。
