    Kuomintang Authorities
    Sell Out Inland Waterway Rights
    Permit Foreign Ships to Berth at Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, and Hankou

    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th] The Kuomintang authorities have once again sold out inland waterway rights, allowing American political and economic forces to penetrate deep into the interior. A Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 6th stated: The Supreme National Defense Council meeting on the 5th passed a proposal by Song Ziwen to allow foreign ships to berth at the four ports of Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, and Hankou during the "rehabilitation period" to load and unload goods. It is claimed that this will allow a large amount of foreign goods to be imported, reducing the price of goods.
