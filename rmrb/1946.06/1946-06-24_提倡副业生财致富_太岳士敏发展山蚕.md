　　Promote Sideline Production for Wealth and Prosperity
    Taiyue Shimin Develops Wild Silkworms
    [This newspaper's Yangcheng dispatch] This year, Taiyue's silkworm industry has seen significant development. In the Shimin Fifth District, 5,271 silkworm rearing trays are in use this year, expected to yield over 31,600 jin of cocoons, increasing income by 3,160,000 yuan. The cocoons are now ready, and various villages are extracting silk during breaks from the busy farming season. In Dongda Village, experienced silk reelers from mutual aid teams are dedicated to silk production, while other villages are organizing women to reel silk. This year's development of silkworm farming in Shimin is due to the government's promotion, the farmers' recognition that sideline production can achieve the goal of "cultivating three, benefiting from one" and achieving prosperity, and the favorable local conditions with abundant mulberry trees. In the Shimin Third District, the amount of silkworm eggs has increased from three jin last year to six jin this year, with almost every household raising three to four trays of silkworms. After the Taiyue District's trial rearing of wild silkworms failed last year, Comrade Yan Jinbiao, the company commander of the Military Region's Special Task Company, continued the trial in Xishanping Village, Yangcheng, with great success. Currently, 200,000 wild silkworms have been placed on shelves to spin cocoons, estimated to produce 15,000 jin of silk. The Taiyue Administrative Office plans to promote this throughout the district and has decided to mobilize five people from Yangcheng and ten people from Qinshui, with the Administrative Office providing food and lodging, to go to Xishanping to learn silkworm rearing techniques. The Jincheng, Yangcheng, Qinshui, Anze, and Jiyuan areas have large tracts of oak forests that can be used for developing the wild silkworm industry. It is expected that the development of the wild silkworm industry in the Taiyue District will have a great future.

　　提倡副业生财致富
    太岳士敏发展山蚕
    【本报阳城讯】太岳山蚕业今年有很大发展。士敏五区今年喂蚕五千二百七十一席，可摘茧三万一千六百余斤，可增加收入三百一十六万元。现蚕茧已成，各村正于农忙中抽空打丝，东大村让长于打丝的互助组员专门打丝，其他各村则将妇女组织起来打丝。今年士敏养蚕的发展是由于政府的提倡、和农民认识了副业生产可以达到耕三余一发财致富、与当地桑树多的条件促成的。士敏三区去年有三斤蚕种，今年增加到六斤，每户差不多都养蚕三四席。去年太岳区试养山蚕失败后，今年军区特务连连长燕金标同志在阳城西山坪村继续试养，成绩很好，现二十万山蚕已上架结茧，估计可制丝一万五千斤。太岳行署拟向全区推广，已决定在阳城动员群众五名，沁水动员群众十名，由行署供给火食赴西山坪学习养蚕技术。晋城、阳城、沁水、安泽、济源一带有大块柞树林可供发展山蚕业之用，预计太岳区山蚕业之发展当有极大前途。
