　　[This article transmitted by this newspaper from Handan on the 19th.] The Kuomintang's (KMT) desperate offensive, attempting to eliminate our Eastern Henan Liberated Area with an initial "pacification" plan, has now failed. The Kuomintang authorities had set a deadline of May 10th to June 10th for the completion of this plan. Starting from May 11th, the Kuomintang mobilized the 181st Division, the 81st Division, the puppet 4th Route Army under Zhang Lanfeng, the Henan Provincial Security Regiment, and security regiments from fifteen counties including Taikang and Qi County, totaling over 30,000 troops, to launch an all-out offensive against our Eastern Henan Liberated Area along five routes: One route, consisting of the 5th Provincial Security Regiment, the Qi County and Minquan Security Regiments, and a portion of the 181st Division, commanded by Mi Wenhe, commander of the 181st Division, concentrated in the Chenliu and Qi County area, attacking our Yin Village and other areas in northern Qi County; another route, consisting of the Sui County Security Regiment, two regiments of the 4th Column, and a portion of the 81st Division, commanded by Ge Kaixiang, commander of the division, concentrated in Taikang and Sui County, attacking our Changgang and Longqu areas; a third route, consisting of the security regiments of the 12th Administrative District of the KMT, the Tongxu Security Battalion, the 1st and 6th Provincial Security Regiments, and a portion of the 81st Division, commanded by Hu Changyi, commissioner of the 12th District, concentrated in Tongxu and Chenliu, attacking our Ouyanggang and Xiaoqinggang areas south of Xu County; the fourth route, consisting of the security regiments of the 5th and 7th Districts, the Huaxi and Huaiyang Security Regiments, commanded by Tian Zhenzhou, concentrated in Taikang and Huaiyang, attacking our Sunxinzhai, Daxinzhai, and Wulikou areas; the fifth route, consisting of two security regiments of the 2nd District, commanded by Mi Jizhang, KMT commissioner of the 2nd District, occupied Huanggangji on the border of Sui and Tuo Counties, to block us. Up to June 9th, the KMT forces had successively occupied thirty-two important towns and villages in our Qi County, Taikang, Fugou, and Chenliu Counties, built thirty-one "anti-communist" strongholds, and gradually pressed towards us. However, our active forces suffered no damage. On the contrary, during this period, the military and civilians of our Eastern Henan Liberated Area continuously launched powerful counterattacks against the invading KMT forces, and carried out ten large-scale anti-"pacification" operations, recovering four important towns and villages, killing or wounding more than 1,100 invading troops, capturing 420 prisoners, and seizing over 500 rifles and carbines, and twelve light and heavy machine guns. On the 10th of this month, our army took advantage of the victory and recovered Luozhuang, a major town south of Qi County. Zhang Yinyuan's Henan Security Regiment of the KMT, with over 700 men, was mostly annihilated. In addition to killing or wounding over a hundred, two hundred were captured alive, one mortar, nine light and heavy machine guns, and over two hundred rifles were seized. Now, the Eastern Henan Liberated Area still stands firm. The local military and civilians are continuing to expand the victory of self-defense and recover the occupied areas.

　　豫东我军自卫战胜利
    接连收复重要村镇五处
    毙伤蒋伪进犯军千余生俘六百多
    【本报邯郸十九日电】蒋伪军疯狂进攻，企图消灭我豫东解放区的初步“清剿”计划，现已告失败。该项计划，国民党当局，曾限令于五月十日至六月十日期内完成。从五月十一日起，国民党即调集一八一师、八一师、伪第四方面军张岚峰部，河南省保安团、以及太康杞县等十五县保安团，约三万余人，五路向我豫东解放区全面进剿：一路为省保安第五团、杞县民权保安团，及一八一师一部，由一八一师师长米文和指挥，分别集结于陈留杞县一带，向我杞北尹店等地进攻；一路为睢县保安团、第四纵队两个团、及八一师一部，由该师师长葛开祥指挥，分集于太康、睢县等地，向我长岗、龙曲一带进攻，一路为国民党十二行政区保安团、通许保安大队、省保安第一、六两团、及八一师一部，由十二专员胡长怡指挥，集结于通许陈留等地，向我许南之欧阳岗、小青岗一带进攻；第四路为五、七两专区保安团、华西、淮阳保安团、由田镇州指挥，集结于太康、淮阳等地，向我孙辛寨、大辛寨、五里口一带进攻；第五路为二专区两保安团，由国民党第二专员米纪章指挥，占领睢拓边之黄岗集一带，向我阻击。迄至六月九日止，蒋伪军虽先后侵占我杞县、太康、扶沟、陈留等县三十二处重要村镇，修筑剿共据点三十一处，并步步向我进逼，但我有生力量丝毫未遭受损害，相反在此期间，我豫东解放区军民曾不断予进犯之蒋伪军，以有力的反击，并先后进行大规模的反“清剿”作战十一次，收复重要村镇四处，毙伤进犯军一千一百余人，抓俘四百二十人，缴步马枪五百余支，轻重机枪十二挺。本月十日，我军复乘胜收复杞南重镇落庄，国民党河南保安团张音远部七百余人大部就歼，除毙伤百余人外，生俘二百余人，缴迫击炮一门，轻重机枪九挺，步枪二百余支。现在豫东解放区，依然坚固屹立，当地军民，正继续扩大自卫胜利，收复被侵占地区。
