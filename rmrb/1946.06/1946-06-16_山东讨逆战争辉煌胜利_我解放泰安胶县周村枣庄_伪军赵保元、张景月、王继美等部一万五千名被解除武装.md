Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 13th: Military news: The Shandong punitive expedition against the traitors has achieved a brilliant victory: (1) The puppet army of Zhao Baoyuan and others, numbering several thousand, entrenched on the Jiaoji Railway in Jiaoxian, launched an offensive against the Eighth Route Army defense zone of over 60 li from Yingjiazhuang in the west of Jiaoxian to ＠shanzhuang on the 8th. The local garrison rose up in counterattack, and by the morning of the 9th, Jiaoxian was completely liberated. The puppet troops of Zhao Baoyuan, Cai Jinkang, Li Deyuan, and others in Jiaoxian, totaling more than 3,000 men, were all disarmed. Puppet military strongholds around Jiaoxian, such as Zhouwei Nanquan, Lancun, and Daxing, were also eliminated at that time. Jiaoxian was recovered by the Eighth Route Army on August 19th last year, and occupied by the enemy puppets on September 8th. This time, it was liberated again by the Eighth Route Army. The people of the county cheered in unison, vying to offer condolences and thanking the Eighth Route Army for liberating the county. (2) The puppet troops of the traitors Zhang Jingyue, Zhou Fangsheng, Wang Yantian, and others, numbering over 3,000, entrenched in Zhangdian and Zhoucun on the Jiaoji Railway, have been continuously attacking us recently. The Eighth Route Army disarmed them all on the evening of the 8th. Zhangdian and Zhoucun were also recovered by our army again. In this battle, more than 200 light and heavy machine guns and more than 4,000 rifles were captured. Zhangdian and Zhoucun were also recovered by the Eighth Route Army after Japan surrendered in August last year, but were subsequently occupied by the enemy puppets on September 10th and 13th last year. (3) The puppet army of Ning Chunlin in Tai'an, formerly part of Wu Huawen's puppet First Route Army, entered Shandong from Anhui after the Japanese invaders surrendered, and seized Tai'an, constantly cooperating with the Kuomintang to invade the liberated areas and disrupt the mediation efforts. The local Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army could no longer tolerate it, and rose up in a punitive expedition. On the evening of the 10th, Ning's troops were dispersed, and Tai'an was entered and garrisoned. At the same time, puppet strongholds such as Zhangda and Chongshan on the railway line north of Tai'an were also completely cleared. (4) The puppet army of the traitor Wang Jimei in Zaozhuang has not stopped its attacks on the liberated areas in recent months, and countless peaceful residents have been killed and wounded by them. On the 8th of this month, our local garrison government delivered a memorandum to the Tai'an group, requesting punishment of the traitor. Unexpectedly, that night, the puppet troops launched another attack on us, and released corrosive poisonous gas, poisoning eight of our soldiers and civilians, and sacrificing one battalion commander. From late on the 8th to the morning of the 10th, our army suffered 14 casualties, including a deputy regiment commander. On the morning of the 10th, Political Commissar Zeng invited the Zaozhuang group to negotiate a settlement, but the Kuomintang representative avoided attending. Our army had no choice but to take self-defense actions.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: The Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army's Shandong and Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu troops, at the request of the broad masses of the people of Shandong, successively liberated Zhangdian, Zhoucun, Jiaoxian, and other places on the Jiaoji Railway, and Dezhou, Tai'an, Zaozhuang on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway from the 8th to the 10th of this month, and disarmed most of the puppet troops entrenched in various places. The puppet troops who have been disarmed, as far as has been ascertained, number approximately 15,000 men. Order is being rapidly restored in various towns. These puppet troops were units under Zhao Baoyuan, Zhang Jingyue, Ning Chunlin, Yang Yuxun, Wang Jimei, and others. During the enemy puppet rule, they committed numerous evils and were notorious. These puppet army leaders, some of whom had served as puppet commanders-in-chief, or had been high-ranking puppet Shandong governors, sold out the motherland, slaughtered fathers and brothers, and were especially hated by the people. When the enemy bandits surrendered, they should have been disarmed and severely punished, but unexpectedly, they were turned around and commissioned by the Kuomintang authorities to continue to harm the people. After the armistice order on January 13, not only did they not restrain their ferocious flames, but they became even more rampant because they received land and air assistance from the Kuomintang authorities, and attacked the liberated areas almost every day. In addition, there were various lawless crimes such as obstructing mediation, shooting at executive department personnel, smuggling military supplies, detaining merchants and civilians, apportioning exorbitant taxes, imprisoning people, raping women, releasing water to flood fields, and destroying factories. Reporters have reported on these crimes many times. The Kuomintang reactionaries launched a large-scale civil war throughout the country. In addition to continuing to attack in the Northeast with more than 200,000 troops, in Hebei, they occupied vast areas of eastern Hebei and Yongding Hebei in central Hebei. In Shanxi, they occupied Qingyuan, Taiyuan, and Xugou areas west of the Tongpu Railway, and attacked Wen (shui) Jiao (cheng) Pingchuan area, and the Jiwangshan area south of the Fen River. In Henan, they attacked the eastern and northern Henan liberated areas. In Suwan, they invaded most of the 4th sub-district, including Dingyuan County. They also launched a full-scale offensive along the Yangtze River in Huainan and Huaibei. The Shandong puppet troops also acted wildly. The Zhangdian puppet troops invaded Licheng liberated area, the Jiaoxian and Gaomi puppet troops attacked both sides of the Jiaoji Railway, and Wang Jimei's puppet troops in Zaozhuang not only did not abide by the agreement to withdraw from Zaozhuang, but also killed and wounded Gan Chongdou, the CCP representative of the executive group, and attacked the Shandong New Fourth Army, releasing corrosive poisonous gas, resulting in the poisoning of eight soldiers and civilians, and the sacrifice of our battalion commander Hu Zihe. Regarding the violation of the agreement by these puppet bandits, Chen Yi, commander of the Shandong Military Region, and General Liu Bocheng, commander of the Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu Military Region, both issued statements, sternly denouncing them and ordering them to repent. However, they were unrepentant and intensified their attacks, and the people suffered even more. They repeatedly requested the extermination of this great scourge. The Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army then launched a punitive expedition on the 8th and have now solved some puppet troops and liberated some areas. The punitive war is continuing, and the people in the liberated areas expressed their gratitude in unison and went to offer condolences. After the liberation of Jiaoxian, many people from the surrounding villages came to offer condolences to the Eighth Route Army. They said in unison: "If you hadn't come, we wouldn't have been able to eat our wheat. This time you drove away the puppet troops, and our people can live."
