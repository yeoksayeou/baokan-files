    Zhangjiakou in the Eyes of an Outsider
    By Rob
    Many factories in Zhangjiakou are running. These factories would be running even faster if it weren’t for the economic blockade caused by the civil war, which prevents the products of Zhangjiakou from reaching the markets of Tianjin, Beiping, and other places. This is the opinion of an American soldier who recently came from the largest city under the control of the Chinese Communist Party.
    This American thoroughly inspected the industry of Zhangjiakou and found a variety of factories that were utilized to the fullest extent possible under the circumstances. A Japanese-built factory that manufactures linseed oil and rapeseed oil can produce 3,000 catties of oil per day. A compressor that supplies oxygen and other gases provides an average of 9,150 gas tanks of gas per day to the iron and steel factories. One of Zhangjiakou's four largest paper mills has been fully put into operation. The American said that if the Communist Party could import the necessary materials for papermaking, the other three could also start operating.
    Zhangjiakou's industrialists also need machines to supplement the equipment destroyed by the Japanese and their puppets, and they also need some parts for repairs. The American said: If they could also export the products of their factories, and if cotton and fur merchants could trade freely at various ports, they could buy some necessities from the Kuomintang-controlled areas. He said: Zhangjiakou merchants have 2 million catties of cotton and 60,000 bundles of fur that are already packaged and ready to be shipped to the market.
    But the Kuomintang army's blockade on the border is very solid. The American spoke with some students who came from Beiping to the Communist-controlled area, and they told him that they had to disguise themselves as farmers when they came here, and how much effort they had to put into finding a route. They also told him that they had not seen any evidence that the railway lines in the Kuomintang area were being repaired, while the workers on the Communist side were busy repairing sleepers and railways.
    The students also told the American that they saw the Kuomintang army demolishing a section of the Great Wall in northern Hebei, but this was not simply complying with the Political Consultative Conference's order to demolish fortifications everywhere. On the contrary, the students said, the Kuomintang army was replacing the new, modern fortifications facing the Communist Party.

    Public Elections
    An election campaign that was probably similar to a local election held in an American village 1,800 years ago was the most interesting thing this American saw in Zhangjiakou. The Communist Party had held many elections before. But because of the war, there was hardly enough time for even a short election campaign.
    Now everything has changed. When the American saw the city, the streets were crowded with processions of people, who stopped everywhere, and the candidates in the team gave campaign speeches there.
    The people of Zhangjiakou have only recently been exposed to this democratic method, and they are still somewhat suspicious, the American said, but they are learning more and more every day about the right to choose their own officials. Children's troupes and propaganda teams work together to educate the people about the importance of choosing upright officials.

    New Rights are Valued
    People who are accustomed to being ruled by Japanese puppets and local bullies are not yet convinced of such things, as expressed in the words of a stonemason, who stood with the American to watch the election.
    "For the first time in my life, I have seen someone who is illiterate and cannot write be able to become a government official," the stonemason said. "Workers have indeed gained benefits that they have never had before, but I don't know if this is good or bad, we are still waiting to see."
    The stonemason told the American that he joined the local trade union, but this was not because he understood anything about "workers' rights." To be frank, he could get more benefits from it.

    Secret Ballot
    The election is by secret ballot, the American said, but for illiterate voters, there is a special procedure. They can choose a trusted scribe to write the ballot for them in front of them.
    Landlords and small businessmen participated in the election as voters and candidates, which made the American inquire about the capitalists and the social status of capitalists in Zhangjiakou. He found that private ownership of industry and land not only existed but was encouraged.
    For example, the very large Baoxing Coal Mine, after being taken over from the Japanese puppets, is now jointly operated by the government and private shareholders. It is divided into 300 shares, and shares worth 140 million yuan of border currency were sold to private individuals, and the government invested 37 million yuan to buy up the remaining shares. Now the mine can produce 400 tons of coal per day, and the new factory director hopes to soon reach the output under Japanese control, which is 450 tons per day. They are hampered by a lack of suitable machinery, and to some extent, a lack of sufficient technical talent.
    However, the problem of technical talent was quickly solved. The Communist Party invited some people from Tianjin and Beiping, and the American said they were paid very high salaries.

    Welcome Americans
    The American said that Zhangjiakou and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region government not only welcome American entrepreneurs, but also American technical talent. Contrary to popular belief, the Communist Party hopes that American import merchants will establish commercial relations with the border region.
    Moreover, General Nie Rongzhen, commander of the Zhangjiakou garrison, said that their government is prepared to offer the highest treatment to invite American technical talent, as long as they are willing to come and train Chinese workers to use modern methods, because the workers currently working in the factories are still using old methods from five, eight, or even ten years ago.
    In the American's view, the Communist Party is absolutely unwilling to continue any form of civil war. He hopes that a peaceful and democratic coalition government can be realized as soon as possible in order to promote their plan to rebuild North China, which they are striving to carry out.

### 外人眼中的张家口

    外人眼中的张家口
    美·罗尔波作
    张家口许多工厂的机器都在转动了。如果没有由于内战而来的经济封锁，把天津北平等市场与张家口的生产品阻隔起来，这些工厂会转动得更快些。一个美国士兵最近从这一中国共产党统治下的最大的城市转来，这是他的意见。
    这个美国人把张家口的工业彻底地巡视了一遍，并且发现了各种各样工厂，在环境所能允许的情形下，利用到了最高限度。日本建造的制造亚麻油与菜油工厂每天能出三千斤油。供给氧气与其他气体的压榨机，平均每天有九千一百五十气槽的气体供应冶铁工厂。张家口四部最大的磨纸机之一已经全部动工。这个美国人说，如果共产党能够输入造纸必须的物品，其他三部也就可以开工了。
    张家口的工业家也需要机器来补充被日伪破坏了的装备，并且也需要一些零件来修补。这个美国人说：如果他们也能输出他们工厂的产品，如果棉商与皮货商能够到各海口自由贸易，他们就能够从国民党统治区域里买到一些必须品。他说：张家口商人有二百万斤棉花与六万捆皮货已经包装好，准备运到市场上去。
    但是国民党军队在边境的封锁是很坚固的。这个美国人曾与一些由北平来到共产党区域的学生说过话，他们告诉他，到这里来时他们不能不把自己改装成农民，并且怎样费尽气力去寻找路径。他们又告诉他，他们没有看到任何一点证据说明在国民党区域里的铁路线是在修筑，而在共产党一边的工人，却正在忙着修理枕木与铁路。
    学生们又告诉这个美国人说：他们看到国民党军队把河北北部一段长城拆毁，但这并不是简单地遵守政协的命令使所有军队都拆毁各地的碉堡，正相反的，这些学生说，国民党军队正在把面向着共产党的新的近代式的碉堡更换装备。
    公开选举
    与一千八百年美国乡村所举行的一次地方选举大概相像的一个选举运动，是这美国人在张家口所见到的最有趣的一桩事。共产党以前已经进行过许多选举。但是因了战事，几乎没有一次有充分的时间，甚至连一次短促的选举运动都难以进行。
    现在一切情形都改变了，这个美国人看到这城市时，街上正挤满整队游行的人，他们到处停下来，队中的候选人就在那里作竞选讲演。
    张家口人民只是在最近一些时才接触到这种民主方式，他们多少还有些怀疑，这个美国人说，但是关于有权去选择自己的官吏，他们一天天懂得更多了。孩子剧团与宣传队合作，教育人民选择正直官吏的重要性。
    新的权利被重视
    惯于被日伪与地方土劣统治的人民，还不确信这样的事，这表现在一个石匠的言语中，他和这个美国人一起站着看选举的进行。
    “我一辈子第一次看见一个不识字也不能写字的人能当政府的官吏”，石匠说：“工人们的确得到了以前从来没有的利益，但是我不知道这是好呢还是坏，我们还等着瞧。”
    石匠告诉美国人说，他加入了地方工会，但是这并不是因为他懂得什么“工人的权利”，说得坦白一点，由此他能够得到更多的好处。
    秘密投票
    选举是秘密投票的，这个美国人说，但是对于不识字的选举人，有一种特殊的处理办法，他们可以选择自己信任的代笔人，代笔人要在他的面前替他写票。
    地主与小商人参加选举，作选举人与候选人，这使得这个美国人询问到张家口的资本家与资本家的社会地位，他发现工业与土地的私有，不仅存在，而且受到了鼓励。
    例如很大的宝兴煤矿，从日伪手上接收过来以后，现在由政府与私人股东共同经营，其中共分三百股，股票卖给私人的共达一万四千万元边币，政府投入三千七百万元收买了剩余股票。现在矿中每天能出四百吨煤，新的厂长期望很快能达到在日本控制下的产量，每天出四百五十吨。他们因为缺乏适用的机器而受了阻碍，同时就某程度来说，没有足够的技术人材。
    不过技术人材的问题，很快的解决了，共产党从天津北平请来了一些人，美国人说他们得到很高的薪金。
    欢迎美国人
    这个美国人说，张家口与晋察冀边区政府不但欢迎美国的企业家，并且也欢迎美国的技术人材。与外面流行的说法相反，共产党希望美国的进口商人与边区建立商业关系。
    而且驻张家口司令聂荣臻将军说，他们的政府准备给最高的待遇请美国的技术人材，只要他们愿意来教练中国工人使用近代的方法，因为这些正在工厂工作的工人们还是用着五年、八年甚至十年以前的老方法。
    照这个美国人的看法，共产党绝不愿意继续任何形式的内战，他希望和平与民主联合政府尽快实现，才可以推行他们正在奋力进行的重建华北计划。（陈宽译自密勒氏评论报）
