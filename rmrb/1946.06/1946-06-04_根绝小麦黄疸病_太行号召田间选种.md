    Eradicate Wheat Yellow Dwarf Virus
    Taihang Calls for Field Selection
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] Wheat waves are turning golden, and farmers are sharpening their sickles. Wheat in the entire Taihang area is about to be harvested. However, due to the excessive rain in late spring, wheat seedlings are prone to yellow dwarf virus, especially the 169 wheat variety. The Administrative Office's Construction Department is specifically calling for field selection to prevent continued infection next year. Last autumn, Lucheng County promoted the 169 wheat variety on 2,200 mu, and it also suffered significantly from yellow dwarf virus. To maintain the excellent and pure variety, the County Government's Construction Section, in addition to calling for the removal of diseased plants and separate harvesting in the county's production bulletin, has also dispatched personnel to the countryside to provide practical guidance.
