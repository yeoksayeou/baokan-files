[This City News] According to statistics from the Dazhong Hospital in this city from the 10th to the 23rd, 18 out of 26 children who sought medical attention suffered from enteritis, accounting for 70% of the total number of visits. According to a letter from Dr. Su Di of the hospital, the main cause of this disease is overeating and catching a cold in the abdomen while sleeping. The best way to prevent it is to have the child wear a bellyband at all times and cover the abdomen well when sleeping, and not let them eat things indiscriminately. When sick, starvation therapy can be adopted, which is most effective.

　　防治小儿肠炎
    【本市讯】据本市大众医院十日至二十三日统计，二十六个就诊孩子中患肠炎者十八名，占就诊总额百分之七十，据该院苏棣大夫来函称：此症主要病源为饮食过多，睡觉时肚子着凉，预防方法在平时最好给孩子挂个兜肚，睡时把肚子盖好，不让乱吃东西，患病时，可采取饥饿治疗法，收效最大。
