Heartfelt Condolences
Liu Xiuzhen

Madam Liu Xiuzhen, wife of General Gao Shuxun, Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic National Construction Army. This article of condolence for the "April 8th" martyrs was received late, and is now published as a supplement for our readers. - Editor

"When I heard that Mr. Wang Ruofei, Mr. Qin Bangxian, Mr. Deng Fa, Mr. Ye Ting, and Mr. Huang Qisheng had died in a plane crash, the sadness in my heart was difficult to express. For several days, I was unhappy because of this incident. Finally, I decided to write a short article to mourn them.

Among the martyrs, the names of Ye Ting and Wang Ruofei were more familiar to me. I hadn't heard much about the others, but because they were all rare and advanced people of the people's revolution, who had struggled for the liberation of the Chinese nation and the liberation of all Chinese people for decades, I had infinite respect for them. Hearing the news of their martyrdom while working for China's cause of peace and democracy caused me infinite grief. I grieve for the cause of the liberation of all Chinese people. It is very difficult to cultivate such strong revolutionary leaders. Once they die, it is a great loss to the Chinese revolution and the Chinese people.

This kind of revolutionary feeling is still new to me. I remember someone once saying: the Eighth Route Army Communist Party is the most ruthless, they abandon their parents, wives and children, and disregard their families. Now I sincerely experience that the Eighth Route Army Communist Party is the most enthusiastic, but this is revolutionary enthusiasm, enthusiasm for the people and the masses. Who can say they are ruthless?

I remember that before the Handan Uprising, as the wife of a senior official, I was flattered everywhere, but at that time I had no interest in life. I was unwilling to ask about state affairs, nor was I willing to talk to people, and I didn't even want to read the newspaper. Since the Handan Uprising, after I came to the liberated area, I found the truth, my enthusiasm was encouraged, and even though I was sick, I still tirelessly promoted the truth, and persuaded and explained to those who did not dare to move forward bravely. Although my body is not very good, my spirit is happy, and my emotions are positive. I realized that this revolutionary enthusiasm for serving the people and the masses is the real enthusiasm. I am determined to always maintain and carry forward this revolutionary enthusiasm to commemorate the martyrs Wang, Qin, Deng, Ye, and Huang!

I hope that the Political Consultative Conference can be implemented as soon as possible, and that a new China can be realized as soon as possible, to comfort the heroic spirits of the martyrs Wang, Qin, Deng, Ye, and Huang."

    衷心的悼念
    刘秀珍
    民主建国军总司令高树勋将军夫人刘秀珍女士，这篇悼念“四八”烈士的文章，因收到较晚，故兹补刊以飨读者——编者          
    “当我听到王若飞、秦邦宪、邓发、叶挺、黄齐生诸先生因飞机失事而遇难时，我心里的难过是很难言说的，几天来我都是为此事不愉快，最后我决心写篇短文来悼念他们。
    诸烈士中我比较熟悉的名字是叶挺和王若飞，其余几位我还没有多听说过，但由于他们都是很难得的人民的革命先进，为中华民族的解放，为全中国人民的解放奋斗了几十年，使我对他们起了无限的敬意。听到他们为中国的和平民主事业，奔走而殉难的消息，又引起了我无限的悲痛，我为全中国人民的解放事业而悲痛，培养这样几个坚强的革命的领导者，是非常不容易的，一旦死去，这是中国革命事业和中国人民的莫大损失。
    这种革命情感在我还是初次尝到，我记得曾有人这样说：八路军共产党是最无情的，他们抛弃了父母妻子，不顾家庭，现在我才真心的经验到，八路军共产党才是最热情的，但这是革命的热情，为人民为大众的热情，谁能说他们是无情。
    记得在邯郸起义以前，我身为高级官长的太太，到处受人恭维，但那时我毫无生的趣味，我不愿过问国事，也不愿和人谈话，连报纸也不愿意看，自从邯郸起义我来到解放区后，我找到了真理，我的热情被鼓舞起来了，我虽然在病中还是滔滔不绝的宣传真理，为一些不敢勇猛前进的人们说服解释，我的身体虽然还不太好，但我的精神是愉快的，我的情绪是积极的，我认识到了这种为人民为大众服务的革命热情才是真正的热情。我决心永远保持和发扬这种革命热情，以此来纪念王、秦、邓、叶、黄诸烈士！
    但愿政治协商会议能早日付诸实施，新中国能早日实现，以慰王、秦、邓、叶、黄诸烈士的英灵。
