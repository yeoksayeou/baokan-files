The Inside Story of the Southeast China-America Seventh Special Training Class
By Chen Shimin

*The author of this article was deceived by Kuomintang secret agents and received training at the Southeast China-America Seventh Special Training Class before being sent to the Central China Liberated Area for sabotage. The author, "after months of generous treatment and the influence of truth from the Communist Party, recognized the vicious conspiracy of the Kuomintang's secret agent policies and truly understood the Communist Party's open and aboveboard nature... and once again began to feel the warmth of humanity" (in the author's words). Therefore, he wrote this article to denounce the brutal crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries. What is published here is a selection from his full text.* ——Editor

The Seventh China-America Special Training Class was located in Dongpeng Village, a sparsely populated small village in the Dahuoshan Mountains, forty miles northeast of Jian'ou County, Fujian. Dai Li initially established a concentration camp in this isolated haven, followed by a special agent training class nearby – a hybrid of Chinese "talent" and American technology.

Dai Li was the head of the class, with Lin Qi, the Director of the Fujian Provincial Public Security Bureau, as his deputy, responsible for actual operations. Seven American instructors were hired to teach modern special agent techniques. The entire class was divided into three brigades:

(1) The Political Work Brigade, with over 200 people, mostly middle school and university students, aimed to cultivate political special agents. After training, they were assigned to party, government, military, and civilian organizations throughout the Southeast, penetrating down to the township, bao, and jia levels, using titles such as instructors and assistants to establish core organizations, supervise the speech and actions of personnel in various organizations, report so-called "ideologically impure" elements, and prevent "communist party" activities. Secondly, they manipulated various organizations and party and government organs in preparation for manipulating the National Assembly elections.

(2) The Special Operations Brigade, a mixed team of military police special agents and intelligence personnel, with over 300 people, mostly demobilized soldiers, local bullies, and vagrants. Its purpose was twofold: first, as transportation special agents and military police special agents, used in transportation inspection teams and the Military Affairs Commission's Unified Inspection Offices for land, sea, and air throughout the Southeast, appearing as staff members. Their task was to control transportation, restrict the people's freedom of movement, and identify "suspicious elements" among travelers. Hotels and restaurants were also subject to inspection. Second, those deemed loyal to the Party and the nation were specifically assigned to "communist areas" to conduct internal operations, obtain intelligence, infiltrate the upper echelons, establish points and lines, and engage in long-term concealment.

(3) The Military Technology Brigade, i.e., armed special agents, with 400 to 500 people, mostly senior officers transferred from the Third War Zone and recruited demobilized soldiers. The training content involved teaching the use of new weapons, such as the M1A1 Thompson submachine gun, rocket launchers, highly explosive white explosives (this explosive was quite powerful; in August of last year, it was used to destroy the Qiantang River Bridge to prevent the New Fourth Army from entering Hangzhou), assault tactics, and new communication equipment. The aim was to organize China-America commando advance teams to attack the Liberated Areas. The China-America commando advance team organized in Xi'an last year belonged to this type.

The China-America Seventh Special Training Class was a cadre training school under the Military Affairs Commission. Before Japan's surrender last year, it had issued enrollment advertisements in Jiangxi, stating: "The purpose of this school is to cooperate with the Allied forces of the Soviet Union and the United States in the counter-offensive and to cultivate talent for national construction." The treatment was the same as that of the Expeditionary Force last year, and after graduation, the school would assign work in the areas of eastern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu based on work performance and service ability. Thus, many pure, naive, and enthusiastic young people who were out of school and unemployed were deceived into joining.

Upon entering the gate of the class, the first thing was the "starvation method," with limited food and meals twice a day. The second was "labor service," building roads and repairing houses, doing free labor for the captains, allowing the captains to earn "construction fees" and pocket them. The third was the opening ceremony, where they swore to obey the leadership, eliminate communist bandits, and keep secrets, with death as the penalty for violation. To strictly enforce school rules, two people were not allowed to talk to each other, one person was not allowed to act alone, they were not allowed to meet with outsiders, they were not allowed to communicate with outsiders, they were to monitor each other, and they were to report each other. In addition, the luggage in the dormitory was subject to open or secret searches at any time, and actions were subject to "observation" everywhere. If one was deemed an unreliable element, he would be transferred away and assassinated under the guise of "job assignment." At that time, a student surnamed Yan was awakened from his dream one rainy night and "assigned a job" because he complained, and he was never seen again, and no one dared to ask about it. In that terrifying den of demons, we were burying our souls day by day; now I repent, this is my repentance, and it is also my serious protest against the reactionaries! To my friends who have suffered with me, I hope you will enthusiastically participate in this protest!

    东南中美第七特训班的内幕
    陈世民作
    本文作者曾受国民党特务欺骗，在东南中美第七特训班受过训练后，被派至华中解放区作破坏工作。作者“经共产党近月来的宽大待遇，及真理的薰陶，认识了国民党的特务政策的恶毒阴谋，真正了解了共产党的光明磊落，…………对人间又开始感到温暖的气息”（作者语），因此，他写此文控诉国民党反动派的残暴罪行。这里发表的，是他全文的择录。          ——编者
    第七中美特训班，设在福建建瓯县东北四十里的大火山中一个人烟稀少的小村庄——东蓬村，戴笠最初在这世外桃源设立集中营，接着在它附近设立特务训练班——这是中国“人材”，加上美国技术的混血儿。
    该班以戴笠为班主任，福建省公安局长林起副之，负实际责任。聘有美国教师七人，传授近代化的特务技术。全班分三大队：
    （一）政治工作队，有二百余人，大多是中学生及大学生，其目的在培养政治特务。训练后，分发到东南各地党政军民机关团体，深入乡保甲基层，以指导员、助理员等名目建立核心组织，监督各机关团体工作人员的言论行动，从中检举所谓“思想不纯”分子，防范“奸党”活动。其次，操纵各种团体及党政机关，准备操纵持持国大选举。
    （二）特工队，即宪兵特务和情报人员的混合队，有三百余人，大部是退伍军人、地痞、流氓。其目的有二：一、交通特务兼宪兵特务，用于东南各地的交通巡查总队与军委会海陆空统一检查处等，以职员面目出现，其任务是控制交通，限制人民行动自由，并从来往行人中发现“可疑分子”，旅馆、饭店也在被检查之列。二、被目为忠于党国的同志，即专门分发到“奸区”进行内线活动，获取情报，打入上层，建立点线，作长期隐伏。
    （三）军事技术队，即武装特务，有四、五百人，大部是从三战区调来的上级军官和招来的退伍军人，训练内容是教授使用新式武器，如孟姆式手提机枪、火箭炮、烈性白色炸药（此药威力颇大，去年八月为阻止新四军入杭州，曾甲此药炸毁钱塘江大桥）、突击战术、新式通讯器材。目的在组织中美突击先遣队，向解放区进攻。去年在西安组织的华北中美突击先遣队，即属此类型。
    中美第七特训班是军委会干部训练学校，去年日本投降前，曾在江西颁过招生广告，上面写着：“本校宗旨为配合苏美盟国反攻，及培养建国人材为宗旨”。待遇与去年远征军相同，毕业后由学校按照工作成绩与服务能力分配浙东、苏南一带工作。于是许多纯洁幼稚之热血的失学失业的青年，就被欺骗进去。
    一进该班大门，第一是“挨饿法”，每天两餐，饭量有限。第二是“劳动服务”，筑路修屋，给队长作无偿苦工，让队长赚“建筑费”装腰包。第三是开学，宣誓服从领导，消灭奸党，保守秘密，违者处死。为严守校规，两人不准交谈，一人不准行动，不与外人接见，不与外人通讯，互相监视，互相检举。此外，宿舍里的行李，随时有人公开或秘密搜查，行动处处有“考察”，若被认为不可靠的分子，就用“分配工作”的名义，将他调走暗杀。当时有一个姓阎的学生，因发怨言，便在一个雨夜把他从梦中唤醒“分配工作”，从此就不见他的踪影了，也无人敢询问。我们在那样的恐怖魔窟中，把自己的灵魂一天天的活埋掉；现在我忏悔了，这是我的忏悔，也是我对反动派的严重抗议！与我共同受害的朋友们，我希望你们热烈的参加这个抗议！
