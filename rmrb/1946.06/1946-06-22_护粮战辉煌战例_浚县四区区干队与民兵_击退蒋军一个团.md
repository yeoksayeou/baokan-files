Brilliant Example of Grain Protection War
　　Junxian Fourth District Cadre Team and Militia
　　Defeat a Regiment of Chiang's Troops
[Report from this newspaper, Ji Lu Yu Front] The Junxian Fourth District Cadre Team and the Bai Si Village militia, with fewer troops than the enemy, bravely repelled the attack by a regiment of the Kuomintang army to seize wheat. At dawn on May 31st, a regiment of the Kuomintang's 30th Division, carrying more than 20 light and heavy machine guns, suddenly invaded the Fourth District of Junxian. This unit used five companies to surround the Fourth District Cadre Team stationed in Bai Si and the village militia, and used four companies to set up ambushes in two places, preparing to attack our reinforcements. Our district cadre team and militia then maneuvered to break through the encirclement and engaged in fierce battle with the invading army outside the village. After the Kuomintang army entered Bai Si, they burned all the newly harvested wheat in the village. The district cadre team and militia, seeing these brutal acts, grew even more angry, and bravely charged forward. After four hours of fierce fighting, they finally defeated the invading army, which had twelve times our strength. The invading army suffered five casualties, including platoon leaders and below. Our district cadre team and militia also suffered casualties. The government is now providing condolences and compensation to the families of the casualties. The Fourth Military Subdistrict Command and Political Department also rewarded the district cadre team with 5,000 yuan and awarded them 500 rounds of ammunition, as well as 10 rifles to the village militia.
[Report from this newspaper, Yangcheng] Along the Tongpu Railway, Yan's army's wheat grabbing is becoming increasingly rampant. In the Huo County and Zhao Cheng sections, the amount of wheat seized in the past four days has reached 1,000 shi. On the 13th, a part of the 3rd Regiment of the 44th Division of Yan's army in Huo County, organized a "revenge team" of more than 300 local special agents and bullies, forcibly dragged more than 200 civilians, attacked our Dongcun, Tadi and other villages, and robbed 390 shi of wheat, 19 head of cattle, and captured Yang Yiduo, the village head of Hedi Village, and killed three of our soldiers and militiamen. On the 16th, more than 1,000 Yan's soldiers of the 44th Division, the "Love the Village Corps," and the "Revenge Team," etc., occupied our Qingleping. Our army heroically counterattacked to defend Qingleping, and after a day of fierce fighting, the area was recovered. Yan's troops suffered heavy casualties and fled in panic. The masses suffered no losses. The 2nd Battalion of the 217th Regiment of Yan's army in Zhao Cheng occupied our Gengbi again on the 13th, and our army recovered Gengbi on the 14th. On the 15th, the unit again invaded our Hutang and Mingchang villages with more than 500 people, and robbed more than 300 shi of wheat in two days. The 196th Regiment of Yan's army stationed in Shengling Shicun attacked the Xialiang area, robbing more than 10 shi of wheat, 5 cattle and donkeys, and 5 carts in Nancun and Suncun, capturing 5 people and injuring 3 people. On the 13th, a part of the 205th Regiment of Yan's army in Linfen invaded our Huojiazhuang, but was repelled by us. Yan's army suffered more than 10 casualties. In addition, a regiment of Yan's army in Quwo invaded our Dongxi Zhangzhai on the 15th, and robbed three carts of wheat. The heroic grain protection struggle is underway in various places as our entire district's military and civilians are combating this crazy activity.
