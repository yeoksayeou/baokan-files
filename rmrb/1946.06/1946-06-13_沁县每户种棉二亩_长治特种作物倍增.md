    Qin County: Each Household Plants Two Mu of Cotton
    Changzhi: Special Crops Increase Several Times Over

    [Our Yangcheng Dispatch] This year, the cotton planting area in the Taiyue region has surpassed any previous year, following the promotion of King Cotton and Jade Corn. In the first district of Fen County, a total of 5,331 mu of cotton has been planted, averaging two mu per household. Jiaochang Village in Dongjiawan, Shimin, has increased cotton planting compared to last year. During the summary of spring production in the fourth district of Shimin, a plan was proposed to achieve self-cultivation, self-spinning, self-weaving, and self-wearing of cotton this year. As for the promotion of King Cotton and Jade Corn, the second district of Qin County alone has planted over 2,100 mu. According to a responsible comrade from the Administrative Office's Construction Department, these crops will be widely adopted throughout the region next year.

    [Our Changzhi Dispatch] After the thorough rent reduction in Changzhi, farmers' enthusiasm for production has reached an unprecedented high, and various special agricultural crops have greatly developed. According to statistics for the entire district, 5,843 mu of hemp have been planted in the whole area, an increase of 2,827 mu compared to last year. Some villages have even increased planting fourfold compared to previous years. The planting of indigo has seen even more rapid development. Last year, only 60 mu were planted in the whole district, but this year it has reached 249.7 mu, a sixfold increase compared to last year. Cotton and King Cotton and Jade Corn, which had never been planted before, now have 203 mu and 541 mu planted, respectively. According to experienced old farmers, indigo was originally a special product of Changzhi. However, due to the Japanese occupation and their forced purchase at low prices during the Anti-Japanese War, planting was greatly reduced. These two crops generally yield three to four times more profit than ordinary crops. This year's planting has increased several times compared to previous years, and since these crops are urgently needed by the people, the profits will be even greater.

    沁县每户种棉二亩
    长治特种作物倍增
    【本报阳城讯】今年太岳区棉花在金皇后玉茭播种，超过已往任何一年。汾县一区共播种棉花五千三百三十一亩，平均每户种棉二亩。士敏董家岩的教场村种棉比去年增加一部，士敏四区总结春季生产时，提出今年植棉要达到自耕、自纺、自织、自穿的计划。至于金皇后玉茭的推广，沁县二区就种了两千一百多亩，据行署建设处负责同志谈，明年全区即可普遍采用。
    【本报长治讯】长治深入减租后，农民生产情绪空前高涨，各种特种农作物大大发展。据全区统计：全区种麻五千八百四十三亩，较去年增加两千八百二十七亩，有些村竟比往年增加四倍，种蓝更是飞跃发展，去年全区只种六十亩，今年即达二百四十九亩七分，六倍于去年。棉和金皇后玉茭，过去根也未种过，今年下种棉花二百零三亩，金皇后五百四十一亩，按照蓝原为长治特产，抗战后因日寇统治，贱价收买，致种植大为减少，据有经验之老农谈，此两种作物，获利一般均超过普通作物三倍到四倍。今年种植较诸往年增加数倍，而此种作物都为人民所急需，获利将更为巨大。
