    If Yan's Troops Do Not Immediately Withdraw from Occupied Areas
    Our Military and People Will Implement Resolute Self-Defense Counterattacks
    [Xinhua News Agency, Fuping, 15th] Besides concentrating forces to attack the Fen River South, Jishui Wang Mountain and Wen (Shui) Jiao (Cheng) Pingchuan areas, Yan Xishan of Shanxi also dispatched on the 6th of this month, in four routes, over 700 men led by Xie Tuan from Yangqu's Huangzhai and Huangshui, east of Taiyuan and west of Meng County, and occupied the villages of Lulingjing, Nanbeihantu and others in the county. The second route, over 1,000 men from the 23rd Regiment of the 46th Division of the 33rd Army, starting from Huanghouyuan under the jurisdiction of Yangqu, via Fengguangang, occupied Shandidong Village under the jurisdiction of Shouyang County. The third route, 900 men from the 2nd Regiment of the 49th Division of the 61st Army, starting from Taiyuan via Mengjiajing, occupied Guojiazhuang and Nangou Village on the border of Yangqu and Shouyang. The fourth route, over 700 men from the 23rd Regiment of the 71st Division of the 33rd Army, starting from Huangzhougou Village under the jurisdiction of Shouyang County, occupied the areas of Dongxi Guoqiu Village and others under the jurisdiction of Meng County. On the 8th, this unit again invaded the Dongxiliang Village and Xinzhuang area, suffering a severe blow from the Eighth Route Army and retreated to its original position. Therefore, the Jiji Military Region has telegraphed the Taiyuan Executive Group, stating that if Yan's troops do not cease all attacks and immediately withdraw from the occupied areas, the military and people of Jiji will implement resolute self-defense counterattacks, and Yan's side shall be responsible for all consequences.
    [This newspaper's Yangcheng, 16th] The Kuomintang army and Yan Xishan's army, which invaded the Fen River South liberated area, have been fiercely attacking and repeatedly "mopping up" for nearly four weeks, and have now been severely counterattacked by the local military and people. On the 10th of this month, two companies of the 72nd Division of Yan's army, which occupied the core area of the Fen River South liberated area, Jishui Wang Mountain, were completely annihilated by us that night, and the villages invaded in Jishui Wang Mountain were immediately recovered by us. The 72nd Division of Yan's army, currently gathered in the Wangfan, Sijiazhuang, and Shipaizhuang area, 30 miles north of Anyi, is being transferred back to the Fen River South liberated area on the 12th, attempting to invade the Wanquan Jing Village area again.
