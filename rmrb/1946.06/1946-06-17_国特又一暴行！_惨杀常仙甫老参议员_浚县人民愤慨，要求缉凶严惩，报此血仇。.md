Nationalists' Another Atrocity!
The Brutal Murder of Elder Senator Chang Xianfu
Junxian People are Indignant, Demanding the Arrest of the Culprits and Severe Punishment to Avenge This Blood Feud.
[This newspaper's Heze dispatch] Mr. Chang Xianfu, an elderly senator beloved by the people of Junxian County, was ambushed by three Kuomintang secret agents on the morning of the 20th of last month on his way home from the county seat. He was shot three times and seriously wounded. The masses carried Mr. Chang back to his home, and while doctors were urgently trying to save him, more than 40 secret agents broke in and finally murdered him. Mr. Chang was 58 years old this year. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, when the Japanese invaders invaded Junxian County, he, at the advanced age of 50, disregarding all personal interests, resolutely led thousands of people to rise up and resist the war. He fought fiercely with the Japanese invaders in places such as Peizhuang and Matou, wiping out hundreds of Japanese invaders, which inspired and encouraged all the people in the county. Later, after the county town fell, Mr. Chang did not lose heart and continued to organize people's armed forces to fight against the enemy and puppets with a spirit of arduous and unyielding struggle. After eight years of hard fighting, he established the Junxian People's Underground Army. The people affectionately called him "Old Immortal Head." After Junxian was liberated last August, he was elected as a county senator due to the admiration and love of the people of the whole county, and he attended the Border Region Assembly this March. When the bad news came out this time, the people of Junxian were all grief-stricken. They were filled with indignation at the Kuomintang's shameless secret agent policy and the Nationalists' despicable and insidious nature. They unanimously demanded that the Border Region Assembly and the Border Region Government arrest the murderers and punish them severely to avenge this blood feud!

    【本报荷泽讯】浚县万人敬爱的老参议员常仙甫先生，于上月廿日上午由县返家途中，被国民党特务三人连击三枪，重伤倒地。群众将先生抬回家中，正延医急治时，又有特务四十余人闯入，终将先生杀害。常先生今年五十八岁，抗战初年日寇侵入浚县时，他以五十高龄，不顾个人一切利害，毅然率领群众数千人起而抗战。曾与日寇大战于裴庄、马头等地，消灭日寇数百人，全县人民，无不奋发鼓舞。后县城失陷，常先生毫不气馁，继续以坚苦卓绝的战斗精神，组织人民武装，打击敌伪。苦斗八年，建立了浚县的人民地下军，人民以亲热的口调呼他“老仙头”。去年八月浚县解放后，由于全县人民的敬仰与爱戴，被选为县参议员，今年三月曾出席边区参议会。此次噩耗传出，浚境人民无不悲痛，对国民党的无耻特务政策与国特的卑鄙阴毒，莫不愤恨填膺，一致要求边参会与边区政府缉拿凶手，予以严惩，报此血仇！
