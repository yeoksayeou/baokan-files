    Raise Vigilance, Eliminate Fascist Germs!
    In recent months, Kuomintang secret agents have been extremely rampant in our border regions. In our various border areas, the Kuomintang has dispatched large numbers of armed secret agents, combining them with their regular armed forces, puppet troops, traitors, local bullies, and bandits, to constantly launch surprise attacks and sabotage against us. At the same time, the Kuomintang secret service agencies in Peiping, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Jinan, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, and other places are actively training and driving fugitive traitors and personnel from puppet organizations to sneak back into our liberated areas under the guise of "repatriation" and "returning home," organizing "armed homecoming teams," etc., to develop secret service organizations, carry out various despicable and shameless acts of rumor-mongering, poisoning, and shooting from the shadows, and even attempt to seize our militia's weapons and establish so-called "underground armies" in order to take advantage of opportunities to riot and coordinate with their military offensives. Currently, incidents of village cadres, enthusiastic mass activists, militiamen, and even impartial members of society being killed have been occurring continuously. The tragic murder of Chang Xianfu, a respected people's representative and venerable senator in Junxian County, is one of the bloody cases created single-handedly by Kuomintang secret agents. Other bloody tragedies are too numerous to recount here!
    The Kuomintang reactionaries' secret service policy is part of their conspiracy of civil war, a comprehensive and complete set of poisonous schemes. Although some of our regions have begun to be vigilant from the lessons of experience, launched struggles against secret agents and encroachment, cracked many shocking assassination and conspiracy-to-riot cases, and repelled the harassment and attacks of armed secret agents, some regions are still not vigilant enough, and the reactionaries' conspiracies have not yet received the punishment they deserve. Individual regions have even shown serious paralysis, thinking that peace has arrived and everything is fine, and have not paid due attention to the open attacks or covert activities of secret agents, which is extremely dangerous. Now that the Kuomintang's conspiracy to expand the civil war is intensifying, the reactionaries will not only not relax their Hitler-inherited "magic weapon" – the secret service policy – but will inevitably strengthen and become more ruthless. Therefore, in our border regions, we must strengthen militia joint defense, strictly enforce sentry checks, resolutely strike at armed secret agents, and promptly and severely suppress a small number of stubborn elements. The most important method is to boldly and fully mobilize the masses, universally implement the movements of anti-treachery and grievance-airing, revenge and liquidation, and rent reduction and interest reduction, so as to further enhance the masses' political consciousness, make the masses' eyes brighter, and be vigilant and expose the conspiracies and poisonous schemes of traitors, secret agents, and a small number of lawless, bullying landlords anytime and anywhere, so that these treacherous villains have no place to hide and no opportunity to take advantage of. Completely eliminating fascist germs is inseparable from the work of defending peace and stopping the civil war.

    提高警惕，消灭法西斯细菌！
    近月来，国民党特务在我边区各地，极为猖獗，在我各边沿区，国民党大量派遣武装特务，结合其正规武装、伪军、汉奸、恶霸与土匪等，不断向我进行突袭破坏。同时，国民党在平、津、石家庄、济南、徐州、开封、太原等地之特务机关，积极训练与驱使各地逃亡之汉奸、伪组织人员，借“复员”、“还乡”为名，组织“武装还乡队”等，重新潜入我解放区，发展特务组织，进行各种卑劣无耻的造谣、投毒、打黑枪，甚至企图收缴我民兵武装，建立所谓“地下军”，以趁机暴动，策应其军事进攻。目前我若干地区村干部、群众积极分子及民兵，以至社会公正人士之被杀事件，已不断发生，浚县万人敬爱的人民代表常仙甫老参议员的惨遭杀害，就是国民党特务一手制造的血案之一，其他血腥的惨案，在此已笔难尽书！
    国民党反动派所进行的特务政策，是其内战阴谋的一部份，是一个全面的一整套的毒谋，虽然我们有的地区已经从事实教训中开始警惕起来，展开了反特务，反蚕食的斗争，破获了不少惊人暗杀与阴谋暴动的案件，打退了武装特务的骚扰和进攻。但有些地区还警惕得不够，反动派的阴谋活动，还远远没有受到其应得的惩罚。个别地区还表现了严重的麻痹现象，以为和平了，一切太平了，对特务公开袭击或暗中活动，没有引起应有的警惕，是极其危险的。现在国民党扩大内战的阴谋正日益加紧，反动派对其希特拉祖传的“法宝”——特务政策，不但不会放松，且必日益强化而毒辣，因之我们在边沿区，要健全民兵联防，严谨岗哨盘查，坚决给武装特务以打击，对少数顽固不化的分子应及时严厉的镇压，而最重要的办法，则必须大胆放手充分发动群众，普遍贯彻反奸诉苦、复仇清算及减租减息运动，使群众的政治觉悟更加提高，群众的眼睛更加明亮，随时随地警惕与揭露汉奸特务及少数非法恶霸地主的阴谋毒计，使彼辈奸徒无匿藏之地，无可乘之隙。彻底消灭法西斯细菌，这与保卫和平、制止内战的工作是分不开的。
