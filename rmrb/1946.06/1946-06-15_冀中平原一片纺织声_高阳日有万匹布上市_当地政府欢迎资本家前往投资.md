    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: The nationally renowned Gaoyang textile industry in Hebei-Central Plain has revived after overcoming difficulties. In over 70% of the county's 108 villages, the majority of the male and female labor force participates in textile or sales cooperatives. 20,000 female spinners produce 120,000 jin of yarn per month. The number of looms has increased from 3,000 to 6,000, and the number of weavers has increased to over 18,000 (mostly men), producing 90,000 bolts of white cloth per month. Now, with Gaoyang County as the center, the trend is spreading to neighboring Qingyuan, Lixian, Renqiu, Anxin, and other areas. A textile boom of "every household spinning yarn, every village weaving cloth" has swept across the Hebei-Central Plain, and Gaoyang's commerce is also flourishing. In early April, the amount of cloth brought to market in the city center has increased from 100 bolts during the enemy occupation to nearly 10,000 bolts. The amount of yarn brought to market has increased from 300 jin to over 12,000 jin, with over 20,000 people involved in transactions. Before the War of Resistance, Gaoyang's textile industry flourished, with 60,000 iron looms, 14 modern machine factories, and an annual output of 1.7 million bolts of cloth, found in Hong Kong, Rangoon, and elsewhere. However, under severe feudal exploitation and imperialist oppression, it could only survive with difficulty. With the Japanese invasion and dumping of goods, Gaoyang's cotton weaving industry plummeted. In 1937, many local cloth shops were forced to close. During the War of Resistance, it suffered repeated ravages, and its fate was particularly tragic. Today, Gaoyang's textile industry has been rebuilt by the people. Although it is still far from its past levels, the smashing of the economic shackles imposed by the Japanese invaders and the great reduction in feudal exploitation have enabled the rapid development of handicrafts. The people are protecting their own industrial products, flooding the markets from the countryside. Four large dyeing and finishing factories in Gaoyang city, including Heji and Enji, have resumed operations. Other weaving factories, dye houses, printing shops, and cloth shops have also resumed business one after another. Gaoyang's textile industry has a bright future, but it needs a large amount of capital, new tools, and technical improvements. The local government and people welcome capitalists to invest and welcome technical personnel to work here.

    冀中平原一片纺织声
    高阳日有万匹布上市
    当地政府欢迎资本家前往投资
    【新华社延安十日电】驰名全国的冀中高阳纺织业，已于克服困难后复兴。全县一百零八个村庄中，已有百分之七十以上的村庄，大部男女劳动力参加纺织或运销合作社，两万纺妇一月出线十二万斤，织布机由三千架增至六千架，织布人数已增至一万八千以上（多为男子），月产白面布九万匹，现以高阳县中心推及邻县清苑、蠡县、任邱、安新等地区，冀中平原已卷起家家纺线村村织布之纺织热潮，高阳商业亦随之欣欣向荣。四月上旬城关每集上市的布已由敌占时之一百匹增至将近万匹，上市的线已由三百斤增至一万二千余斤，交易人数均在两万以上。抗战前高阳纺织业曾盛极一时，拥有铁机六万架，近代机器工厂十四家，年产布一百七十万匹，香港仰光等地有其踪迹。但是在严重的封建剥削与帝国主义压榨下，只能曲折多难的生存，迨日寇侵入倾销，高阳棉织业便一落千丈，一九三七年许多土布栈庄被迫关门，抗战中迭遭蹂躏，命运尤惨。今天高阳纺织业已为人民重建，虽与过去水平相距尚远，但由于日寇经济束缚枷锁的粉碎，与封建剥削的大大减弱，已使手工业迅速发展。人民保护着他们自己的工业产品，从农村中涌上集市，高阳城内合记、恩记等四家大的染轧工厂，已经复工，其他织厂、染坊、印花、布店等亦纷纷复业开张。高阳的纺织业有着远大前途，但需要大量资本，新式工具，和技术上的改良。当地政府和人民，欢迎资本家前往投资，欢迎技术人才前往工作。
