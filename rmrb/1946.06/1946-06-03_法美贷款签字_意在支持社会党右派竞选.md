    Franco-American Loan Signed
    Intended to Support Right-Wing Socialists' Election Campaign
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th] Washington dispatch: The Franco-American loan was signed in Washington on the 28th. It is reported that according to the agreement, the US will provide France with a loan of $1.372 billion from the Export-Import Bank. This loan is different from the loan to Britain and does not require approval from the US Congress. The Franco-American loan negotiation began on March 15th with the visit of Blum, the leader of the right-wing of the French Socialist Party, to the United States, and was largely finalized on May 5th after the defeat of the French new constitution referendum. The reason for not announcing the signing news until now, according to US officials, is that the US intends to strengthen the position of the Socialist Blum in the French general election in June. A US news agency reported on the 29th that Blum is scheduled to fly back to Paris on the same day to lead the Socialist Party in the final three days of the political campaign.

    法美贷款签字
    意在支持社会党右派竞选
    【新华社延安三十电】华盛顿讯：法美贷款已于二十八日在北间签字。据称：按照该协定，美将由进出口银行给予法方贷款十三亿七千二百万元。此项贷款与对英之贷款不同，无须经过美国会之批准。按法美贷款谈判，开始于三月十五日法社会党右派领袖勃鲁姆之赴美，而于五月五日法国新宪法复决遭受顿挫后，大致确定。直到现在始行公布签字消息的原因，根据美官场透露，系美方图以加强社会党勃鲁姆在法国六月大选中的地位。美新闻社二十九日电称：勃鲁姆定于该日飞返巴黎，以领导社会党进行最后三日之政治竞选。
