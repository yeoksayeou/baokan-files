    Qin River Floods
    Wuzhi County Government Undertakes Emergency Relief
    [This newspaper, Jiaozuo] In the middle of last month, the Qin River flooded, and the floodwaters burst through breaches in the Donghong Bridge and other areas caused by the special agent Zhang Jingzhong several years ago. The Qin South region, including the 37 villages and towns of Sihongqiao, Shi Wangzhuang, Sibeigu, Wei Village, Pangzhuang, Xiao Sima, and Dong'an Village, as well as surrounding wheat fields for dozens of li, were turned into a watery expanse. Although the floodwaters have receded, the ripening wheat seedlings have been completely ruined. The Wuzhi Democratic Government held an emergency administrative meeting on the 20th of last month, deciding to not only allocate local grain for emergency relief, but also issue loans of 400,000 yuan to organize the masses for production and self-salvation, and to launch social mutual assistance, calling on non-disaster areas of the county to help the people in the disaster areas.
