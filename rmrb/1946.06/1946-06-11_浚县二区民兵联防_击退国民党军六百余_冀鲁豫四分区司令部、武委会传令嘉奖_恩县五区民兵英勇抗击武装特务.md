    Repels Over 600 Kuomintang Troops
    Fourth Military Sub-district Command and Military Commission of Jiluyu Commend
    Enxian Fifth District Militia Heroically Resist Armed Special Agents
    [This newspaper's Heze dispatch] The Junxian Second District Militia Joint Defense repelled an attack by over 600 Kuomintang troops, and the Fourth Military Sub-district Command and Military Commission jointly issued a commendation. On the night of May 23rd, a main force of the Kuomintang army's 30th Army, in coordination with the puppet army of Niu Yingde, totaling 600 men, surrounded the Junxian Second District team's militia joint defense in Bole and Shigezhang Villages, attempting to annihilate our local armed forces. After the militia joint defense discovered this, they immediately launched a fierce counterattack against the invading army several times. Although the invading army destroyed the Siping building in Bole Village with artillery fire due to the disparity in numbers, the defending militia still stubbornly held their ground. Upon hearing the news, the Junxian Second District militia and district cadres rushed to reinforce. Our militia joint defense concentrated their firepower and charged fiercely at the invading army, breaking through the encirclement after six hours of fierce fighting and repelling the enemy. We took advantage of the victory to pursue the invading army to the Gongzhuang and Luanzhuang area. In this battle, nine invading soldiers were killed or wounded, and we only suffered one minor injury. We also captured one rifle, thirty rounds of ammunition, and twenty rounds of Mauser pistol ammunition. This battle fully demonstrated the brave and tenacious fighting will of our local armed militia. The experience of this victorious battle proves that as long as the local armed "district cadre team" and militia joint defense cooperate closely and are united, we can further strengthen our self-defense forces and defeat the invading army. The district has decided to convene a district-wide victory rally for the anti-stubborn struggle to comfort and commend the combat heroes, and the county government will issue a commendation. In addition, the sub-district command awarded the district cadre team a light machine gun and 200 rounds of ammunition, and the militia ten rifles. The sub-district military commission specifically awarded the militia 200 bombs and ten dozen towels and called on all corps, local armed forces, and militia joint defenses to learn from the Junxian Second District team and the militia joint defense.
    [This newspaper's Weixian dispatch] Sun Zhendong and Sun Guangtao, heads of the Dezhou special agents, led 200 armed special agents, carrying two machine guns, in a conspiracy to surround our Enxian Suzhuang Village at 1:00 AM on the 18th of last month. After the villagers discovered this, they immediately rose up and resolutely resisted. The enemy's several charges were repelled. The fierce battle continued until 5:30 AM, and these shameless bandits repeatedly sent reinforcements before our militia withdrew from their position. After the enemy entered the village, they wantonly burned, killed, and looted, and then fled to Houguantun, Hezhuangyi, and other villages. After our Suzhuang militia clearly reconnoitered the enemy's escape route, they reported to the Fourth District Military Commission of Xiazhen. Upon hearing the news, Director Yang of the Military Commission immediately dispatched militia from this district to cooperate with the Suzhuang militia in two groups. After encountering the enemy in Yihezhuang, they immediately disrupted the enemy. The fierce battle continued until 10:00 AM before they withdrew from their position to rest thirty li away from Yihezhuang. The local people greatly admired the heroic fighting of the militia and diligently provided water and food. In the afternoon, they received an order to cooperate with the Enxian County Brigade to resolutely defeat this band of bandits. All the militiamen were extremely excited, completely forgetting the fatigue of the battle, and enthusiastically signed up to participate in this action, persisting in fierce fighting with the enemy until 4:00 PM, driving them back and beginning to withdraw. After the battle, the militia received enthusiastic praise and comfort from the local people, who automatically raised funds to purchase ammunition for the militia, unanimously vowing to resolutely give the attacking bandits a severe blow.
