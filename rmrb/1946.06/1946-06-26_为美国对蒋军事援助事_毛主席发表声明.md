Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the following statement today regarding US military aid to Chiang Kai-shek:

　　The US State Department's bill submitted to Congress on the 14th of this month for continued military aid to Chiang Kai-shek has an extremely detrimental impact on China's peace, stability, independence, and democracy. Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party insists on opposing this bill. This opinion of the CCP is also supported by the broad masses of Chinese democrats. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the United States provided military aid to China and dispatched American troops to cooperate in combat on Chinese territory, with the aim of defeating the common enemy of China and the United States, Japanese imperialism. However, even then, due to the United States mistakenly only aiding the Kuomintang warlords, this aid did not effectively strengthen China's resistance. On the contrary, it was used by the Kuomintang warlords to strengthen their attacks and blockades against the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Liberated Areas, who were actively resisting Japan. After the Japanese surrender, the United States did not cease, but greatly strengthened its various military aid to the Chinese Kuomintang government and, with this practical aim, dispatched large numbers of troops to be stationed on Chinese territory and in Chinese waters. This action has proven to be the fundamental reason for the outbreak and continued expansion of large-scale civil war in China. Only under the premise that the US government fulfills the obligations of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference Communiqué of October 1945 regarding the China issue, and that the Chinese Kuomintang announces the cessation of the civil war and the fulfillment of the resolutions of the Chinese Political Consultative Conference on national democratization, will the Chinese Communist Party never oppose some form of US military aid to China. However, now that these premises have been seriously undermined, the so-called military aid implemented by the United States is actually armed interference in China's internal affairs; it is merely using force to support the Kuomintang's dictatorial government, continuing to plunge China into civil war, division, chaos, terror, and poverty; it is merely preventing China from realizing military reorganization and demobilization, and fulfilling its obligations to the United Nations; it is merely endangering China's national security, independence, and territorial sovereignty and integrity; it is merely destroying the glorious friendship between the two great nations of China and the United States, and the prospects for the development of Sino-US trade. What the Chinese people urgently need today is not American guns and cannons and the continued stationing of American troops in Chinese territory; on the contrary, the Chinese people hate that too much American military equipment has been shipped to China, and that too many American troops are stationed in China, as they constitute a serious and enormous threat to China's peace and stability and the survival and freedom of the Chinese people. Under these realistic circumstances, the Chinese Communist Party has no choice but to resolutely oppose the US government's continued transfer of military equipment to the Kuomintang dictatorial government of China through sale, exchange, lease, gift, or transfer, resolutely oppose the US sending military advisors to China, and resolutely demand that the US immediately stop and withdraw all so-called military aid to China, and immediately withdraw all American troops stationed in China.

　　为美国对蒋军事援助事
    毛主席发表声明
    〔新华社延安二十二日电〕中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东，今日为美国对蒋军事援助事发表声明如下：
    美国国务院于本月十四日  提付国会审议的继续对蒋军事援助法案，对中国的和平安定与独立民主有极为不利的影响，因此中国共产党坚持反对此项法案。中共此项意见，并为中国广大民主人士所支持。在抗日战争中，美国对于中国实施军事援助，并派遣美军在中国领土上协同作战，其目的是击败中美的共同敌人日本帝国主义。但就在那时，由于美国错误地仅仅援助国民党军阀，这种援助也并未有效地加强中国的抵抗，相反地是被国民党军阀用以加强其对于极积抗日的中国共产党与中国解放区的进攻与封锁。在日本投降以后，美国没有停止、反而极大的加强了对于中国国民党政府的各项军事援助，并在此实际目的下，派遣广大的军队驻在中国的领土与领海之上。这种行动，已经证明是中国大规模内战爆发与继续扩大的根本原因。仅仅在美国政府履行一九四五年十月莫斯科三国外长会议公报关于中国问题的约束，中国国民党与宣布停止内战和宣布履行中国政治协商会议会议关于国家民主化的决议的前提之下，中国共产党才会绝不反对美国对于中国的某种军事援助。但是现在这些前提都已被严重破坏，因此美国实行所谓军事援助，实际上只是武装干涉中国内政；只是以强力支持国民党独裁政府，继续陷中国于内战、分裂、混乱、恐怖和贫困；只是使中国不能实现整军复员，和履行其对于联合国的议务；只是危害中国国家安全独立与领土主权完整；只是破坏中美两大民族的光荣友谊、与中美贸易的发展前途。中国人民今天所急须的，并不是美国的枪炮及美军留驻中国领地；相反，中国人民痛恨美国运来中国的军火已经太多，美国在中国的军队已经驻的太多，它们已经构成中国的和平和安定与中国人民的生存和自由之严重巨大威胁。在此种现实情况之下，中国共产党不得不坚决反对美国政府继续以出售、交换、租借、赠送或让渡等方式将军火交给中国的国民党独裁政府，坚决反对美国派遣军事顾问来华，并坚决要求美国立即停止与收回对华的一切所谓军事援助，和立即彻回在华的美国军队。
