　　Taihang Undertakes沁 River Water Conservancy Project
    Increasing Irrigable Land by Over 20,000 Mu
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] The沁 River Conservancy Bureau has been established in the Fourth Special District of Taihang, specializing in the沁 River water conservancy projects within the four counties of沁阳, 博爱, 修武, and 武陟. It will engage in activities such as building dikes, dredging rivers, constructing sluices, and opening canals to manage the沁 River and prevent floods. During the Qing Dynasty, the governance of the沁 River cost 12,000 taels of silver annually. Since the Republic of China, a沁 River Public Works Bureau was also established, with the East沁 Branch Bureau located in 武陟 and the West沁 Branch Bureau in 沁阳. Each year, a special fund of 15,000 yuan was allocated to build dikes and prevent floods. However, due to the use of materials such as corn stalks, reeds, and wooden stakes for blocking and reinforcing, floods occurred year after year. Since the War of Resistance, water conservancy has fallen into disrepair, coupled with the destruction by the enemy, puppets, and stubborn elements, resulting in the inundation of hundreds of miles of fertile land along both banks every summer and autumn. After liberation, our democratic government provided loans of 100,000 yuan and a portion of grain to organize the people along the river in the four counties to repair the river堤. Recently, a million yuan has been allocated, ordering the bureau to quickly complete the river engineering works along the river. Not only must all the river堤 be repaired, but it has also been decided to build six more sluices and open canals to increase the irrigation area. Upon completion, it can newly irrigate 28,000 mu of land.

　　太行兴修沁河水利
    可增水地两万余亩
    【本报长治讯】沁河河工局已在太行四专区成立，专司沁阳、博爱、修武、武陟四县境内沁河水利工程，从事筑堤，浚河、建闸、开渠等，以管理沁河，防止水患。前清时治理沁河每年即耗银子一万二千两，民国以来亦设有沁河工务局，当时东沁支局设武陟，西沁支局设沁阳，每年均以一万五千元专款，筑堤防水，但仅以玉茭杆苇草，木桩等物从事堵寨，故水患连年不绝。抗战以来水利失修，加以敌伪顽的破坏，致使每到夏秋，两岸数百里沃野，尽被淹没。解放后我民主政府即贷款十万元及粮食一部，组织四县沿河人民修补河堤，最近并拨款百万，饬令该局迅速完成沿河工程。不仅须修复全部河堤，并决定增建水闸六处，开渠引水，以增加灌溉面积。完成后，可新增水地二万八千亩。
