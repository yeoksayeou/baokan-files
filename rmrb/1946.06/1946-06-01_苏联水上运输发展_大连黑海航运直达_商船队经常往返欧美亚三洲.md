Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th: Moscow dispatch: Soviet water transport will undergo tremendous development in the next five years and is currently actively expanding and growing. The new Soviet Five-Year Plan stipulates that the total transport volume of the merchant fleet will more than double compared to the pre-war level. Black Sea commercial freight will exceed pre-war levels fivefold, and the freight volume of the Black Sea-Baki commercial port will exceed wartime levels by two and a half to three times. Currently, Baki Port is using a large amount of new equipment, with 80% of the cargo loaded by machines. From here, timber, grain, cement, etc., are transported to Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, and the Americas. At the same time, the establishment of regular shipping from the Black Sea via the Suez Canal to the Far East has begun. The steamer "Gamai," sailing from the Black Sea to Dalian, fully loaded with soybeans, departed from Dalian, crossed the Yellow Sea, the South China coast, and the Indian Ocean, and has arrived in Calcutta. After loading jute in Calcutta, it sailed back to the Black Sea. Several more steamers have now left Dalian for the Black Sea. The number of voyages from the Black Sea to Europe and America will be greatly increased. Ports such as Odessa, Novorossiysk, and Sevastopol will be fully restored by 1948. In the Baltic Sea region, the volume of merchant freight will double in the next five years compared to 1940. The total displacement of Baltic Sea vessels will reach approximately 200,000 tons by 1950. The volume of freight and passenger traffic between Leningrad, Tallinn, Riga, Libaya, and Europe and North and South America will increase four to five times. In the Far East routes, the transport center is Primorsky Bay and its capital, Vladivostok, which is the only route to the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk, Kamchatka, and Sakhalin. Currently, dozens of Pacific ships are sailing in the Far East territorial waters, transporting building materials, fuel, machinery, and equipment to remote coasts, as well as transporting sea fish, oil, paper, and other daily necessities. Routes from Vladivostok to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in Kamchatka, and even to the Kuril Islands, will also be opened soon, and routes from Vladivostok to Dalian Port and from Vladivostok to Shanghai have begun operation.
