　　Dongjiawan Mutual Aid Team Persists in Three Years of Gradual Development – Communication from Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region
    The Dongjiawan Mutual Aid Team is an example of long-term fixed mutual aid in Zizhou County (a newly established county in the Suide sub-region) in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. It has been developing for three years. The number of households participating in mutual aid increased from 23 two years ago to 25 last year, and this year it has increased to 26. The village has a total of 61 households, with 40 households in the front village, of which 37 are engaged in commerce, small handicrafts, and odd jobs. The rear village has 21 households, most of which are engaged in agriculture. Sixteen households participate in the long-term mutual aid team. There are a total of 214 *mu* of land, with 188 *mu* participating in long-term mutual aid. The other five households that did not participate in long-term mutual aid have a total of 26.5 *mu* of land, 20.5 *mu* of which is jointly cultivated, and 6 *mu* is used for temporary exchange of labor. It can be said that, apart from the jointly cultivated land, 100% of the land in the rear village is under mutual aid. Women also participate in mutual aid for cooking, saving time for spinning and weaving.

    This mutual aid team has a deep-rooted foundation among the masses and has become an important factor in the agricultural development of the village. In the past three years, the labor saved has been used to improve farming and engage in craft work and coal pulling, resulting in increased agricultural output and sideline production. For example, before mutual aid, Li Heyi, a member of the mutual aid team, hired half a worker for his 12 *mu* of mountain land, spending 3 *shi* of grain on food and wages, and only harvested 1.6 *shi* of coarse grains and 3 bags of potatoes. Two years ago, after joining the mutual aid team, he did not hire anyone for the same land and harvested 4 *shi* of coarse grains and 8 bags of potatoes, yielding a net profit of 3.5 *jin* of cotton. In addition, he earned 1 *shi* of rice working odd jobs himself. This year, he bought 1 *mu* of mountain land and mortgaged 0.5 *mu* of riverbed land, expanding production.

    The team has a central production plan every year. The focus two years ago was on improving farming and crafting, with the team building dams to increase the water supply by two-thirds, reclaiming 17 *mu* of old wasteland on cliffs, and weeding four times on average (previously mostly twice). In addition, 19 *mu* were ploughed in autumn. During the crafting period, each person earned 4 *dou* of rice. The central plan last year was to increase cotton fields and improve cultivation, with 16 *mu* of cotton planted, and weeding seven or eight times, six times more than the previous year. The average yield was 40 *jin* per *mu*, an increase of half compared to the previous year.

    This year's central plan is to improve cotton planting and deep plowing and meticulous cultivation. The cotton field has been increased to 18 *mu*, with one more plowing than last year, and two more weedings and hoeings. Plowing is generally one inch deeper than last year. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, each household makes a circle at the bottom of the slope to compost manure with mud and grass, increasing 2 cloth bags of manure per *mu* of land. Other crops are the same as last year, and it is planned that each person will earn 6 *dou* of rice through craft work. From the above materials, it can be seen that the cultivation methods of the mutual aid team are becoming more and more meticulous year by year, and the output (such as cotton) is also increasing accordingly.

    Strong leadership and reasonable work point calculation methods are the main reasons for the consolidation and expansion of this mutual aid team. Administrative Director Wang Pilin, a 62-year-old gentleman, has overcome various difficulties in the past three years to lead this mutual aid team. Under his planning, the organizational form and work point calculation method of the team are simple and reasonable, and are very popular among the members. They divided the team into three groups. Except for centralized weeding, they usually work in groups. Each group has a group leader whose responsibility is to mediate disputes, convene meetings, and direct work and rest. Meetings are generally held every three days, and once a day during busy farming seasons, but they are not specifically convened, but discussed during meals, so that it is neither delayed work nor tiring. The team has a lot of manpower, with differences in labor strength, work quality, land area, and distance. Therefore, it is stipulated that one work point equals one work point, two equals one, three equals one, etc., as a method of converting work. To solve the problem of labor strength, team members and cadres work together to help him improve. People with less land are compensated by people with more land, or paid wages, or the people with less land are completely withdrawn to work outside, and then return to the mutual aid team to pay back their labor or pay wages. Stonemasons, carpenters, etc., go out to work when they have work, and return to use their own skills to pay back their labor to the team members, calculated at one work point equaling two work points. In order to ensure the successful completion of the production plan, the team members voluntarily formulated six labor disciplines and jointly abide by them.

    After the mutual aid team was organized, it was not smooth sailing. In the beginning, some team members had average ideas on work point calculation and were unwilling to take care of the old and weak team members. Wang Pilin patiently persuaded them. For example, team member Li Fenggong was a 58-year-old man. He was the uncle of the mutual aid team leader, and everyone thought he was too weak to be counted as a full labor force, but they were embarrassed to say it in front of the captain. Wang Pilin explained to everyone: "He is old, his days are not good, and he has no children. He is also a member of our village. Even if he does not contribute labor, we should help him. Besides, the captain's labor is stronger than anyone in our team, and it can be transferred from his share." After several times of persuasion, everyone was willing to help him.

    The team members have good and bad production techniques. How to help the bad ones improve their skills should be one of the main tasks of the mutual aid team, but some team members are unwilling to do so. For example, team member Wang Zhenguo is nearsighted and has poor work skills, especially weeding, and often cuts off seedlings. Everyone scolded him. Wang Pilin assigned him to work with the captain and helped him to guide him. If he didn't weed cleanly, he helped him to weed cleanly. Now his technology has improved and he has become a good laborer. He works very diligently with heavy work, and was promoted to group leader last autumn.

    Problems also occurred in the conversion of work points: for example, team member Wang Runsheng was 17 years old the year before, and two days were counted as one work point. He was not satisfied and was "hanging around." The team members all said about him. Wang Pilin talked to him and persuaded him to work hard, so he didn't "hang around" anymore. In the summer, everyone promoted him to one and a half days per work point. In the autumn, he was silent and sullen at home. Wang Pilin couldn't figure it out, so he went to the township to study with the cadres and estimated that he had objections to the work point calculation. So Wang Pilin called him to a meeting and asked everyone to discuss whether he could count as one work point, and everyone said that he carried wheat the same as everyone else, was quick on his feet, and didn't slack off on heavy work, so he could count as one work point. When Wang Pilin asked him if he had any comments, he smiled and said, "Nothing!" As soon as work started this year, everyone elected him as the group leader.

    In addition to paying attention to solving the problems of the mutual aid team itself, Wang Pilin also paid special attention to solving the personal difficulties of each team member. For example, team member Wang Zhiguo was very old and could not afford to marry a wife, so he spent all his money. Wang Pilin helped him to settle on one in the winter of the year before, and also borrowed him a *jin* of sesame oil and several *dou* of wheat to bring his wife home. Last year, Wang Zhiguo didn't want to engage in mutual aid anymore. Wang Pilin went to his home and said to him: "Now you are a person who has established a family, so you must improve your family business. What is the way out for messing around outside?" Wang Zhiguo couldn't answer a word, and from then on he engaged in mutual aid properly again.

    According to Wang Pilin, the head of the Dongjiawan Mutual Aid Team, is a special-class labor hero in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. This 62-year-old patriarch led the mutual aid production of 26 households, making it a democratic, meticulous, and enthusiastic production mutual aid team, which is worthy of learning from all over the country.

　　董家湾变工队坚持三年逐年发展
    陕甘宁边区通讯
    董家湾变工队，是陕甘宁边区子州（是绥德分区的新设县）县长期固定变工的范例，三年来它一直在发展着，前年参加变工的二十三户，去年增至二十五户。今年则增至二十六户。该村共住六十一户，前庄四十户，中有三十七户从事经商、小手工业和揽工，后庄住二十一户，绝大部分从事农业，有十六户参加了长期变工队。共有地二百一十四垧，参加长期变工地一百八十八垧，其他未参加长期变工的五户，共有地二十六垧半，伙出二十垧半，临时活变六垧，可以说后庄地除伙出外已百分之百的变工了。妇女们也变工做饭，节省下工夫纺线织布。
    这个变工队在群众中有了根深蒂固的基础，成为该村农业发展的重要因素，三年来节省的工用于改良农作和从事扎工，拉炭，致使农业产量和副业都有增加，如变工队员李合义前年不变工时，十二垧山地雇半个工，用去吃粮和工资米三石，打粗粮仅一石六斗，洋芋三袋，前年参加了变工队，同样的地没有雇人，打粗粮四石，洋芋八袋，收净花三斤半，另外自己打短工挣米一石，今年买了一垧山地，典进半垧川地，扩大了生产。
    该队每年生产都有中心计划，前年的中心是改良农作和扎工，计全队打水坝增加三分之二，掏老荒崖地十七垧，锄草一般都锄了四次（过去大半锄二次）。此外秋翻地十九垧。扎工时每人挣了四斗米。去年中心计划则是增加棉地改良作务，计增种棉花十六垧，打卡七八次，较前年多打六次，收获量每垧平均四十斤，较前年增收一半。
    今年中心计划是提高植棉和深耕细作，棉地增加到十八垧，比去年多耕一次，锄草和打卡各增加二次，耕地一般要比去年深耕一寸。积肥方面每家在坡底下做一个圈用泥草沤粪，每垧地多增加两布袋粪，其他农作均和去年相同，并计划扎工每人挣米六斗。从上述材料中可以看出变工队耕作法一年比一年细致，产量（如棉花）亦随之增加。
    强有力的领导和合理计工法，是这个变工队巩固与扩大的主要原因。行政主任王丕林是个六十二岁的老先生，三年来他克服了种种困难，领导着这个变工队，在他的筹划下，该队组织形式与计工办法简单合理，很受队员们欢迎。他们把全队分为三个班，除锄草时集中外，平常时以班为单位作活，各班设一班长，其职责在于调解纠纷，召集开会，指挥作息。开会时间一般规定三天一次，农忙时则一天一次，但不专门召集，而是在吃饭时商谈，这样既不误工又不疲劳。该队人力很多，劳力强弱，作务好坏，地段多少，距离远近，均有差异，故规定以一工顶一工，二顶一，三顶一等折工办法。解决劳力强弱问题，队员和干部一起作活，帮助他改进。地少的人由地多欠工的人还工，或付工资，或把地少的人完全抽出让他出外揽工，将来回来再给变工队还工，或付工资。石匠、木匠等等有活就出去作，回来后用本身手艺给队员还工，以一工顶二工计算。关于地的远近好坏都是一天算一天工，不因地远地坏作活少而少计工，为了保证生产计划胜利完成，队员们自愿订了六条劳动纪律，共同遵守。
    变工队组织起来后并不是一帆风顺的。开始时，有些队员在计工上有平均观念，不愿照顾老弱队员，王丕林便耐心说服，例如队员李封功是个五十八岁的老汉，他是变工队长的叔父，大家嫌他劳力弱不能算个全劳动，可是又不好意思在队长面前说，王丕林便向大家解释：“他人老了，日月不好，又没儿女，又是自己庄里人，即使他不出劳力也应该帮助他，再说队长的劳力比咱们队里那个也强，从他的份下也能匀过去，经这样劝解了几次，大家都愿意帮助他了。
    队员们的生产技术有好有坏，如何帮助坏的提高技术，应该是变工队的主要任务之一，可是有些队员不愿意这样做。例如队员王振国是个近视眼，作务技术不好，特别是锄草是经常把苗子砍掉，大家都骂他，王丕林便分配他和队长一起作活，由队长帮助指导他，锄不净的帮他锄净，现在他的技术提高了，成了一个好劳动，苦重的活儿他干的很勤快，去年秋升做班长。
    在折工问题上，也曾发生过问题：如队员王润生，年前十七岁，两天顶一工，他不满意，“吊儿浪当，”队员们都说他，王丕林便找他谈，劝他好好劳动，这样他不“吊儿浪当”了。夏天众人便升他一天半顶一工，到秋天他不言不语的闷在家里了，王丕林摸不着头脑，便到乡上和干部去研究，估计他对计工有意见，于是王丕林便叫他来开会，叫大家讨论他能不能一工顶一工，大家都说他背麦子和大家一样，腿把子勤快，苦重的活儿也不偷懒，能够一工顶一工，王丕林再问他有什么意见时，他笑着说：“没啥了！”今年一动工大家便选他当了班长。
    王丕林除注意解决变工队本身问题外，还特别注意解决每个队员的切身困难，例如队员王治国，年纪很大了娶不起老婆，有钱就花掉，王丕林便在前年冬天帮他说定了一个，还给他借了一斤麻油几斗麦子，把老婆引过门，去年王治国又不想变工了，王丕林便到他家去对他说：“现在你是成家立业的人了，总要把家业往好里闹，出门胡混有什么出路？”说得王治国一句话也回答不了，从此又好好变工了。
    按董家湾变工队长王丕林，是陕甘宁边区特等劳动英雄，这个六十二岁的老家长，领导了二十六户的变工生产，使之成为一个民主，细密热情生产的变工队，是值得各地学习的。
