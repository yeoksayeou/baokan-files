　　Five Thousand Businessmen in Xingtai
　　Enthusiastically Study Current Affairs and Policies
　　Recognize Their Future, and Are Willing to Strive to Develop Commerce

　　[Report from our Xingtai office] Since last month, managers, second managers, and shop assistants of various shops in Xingtai city have enthusiastically participated in the study of current affairs and policies, using the evenings to discuss current affairs and policies separately. In West Street alone, 219 managers, 340 second managers, and 117 shop assistants participated, totaling more than 5,000 people in the city. The spirit of free thought and democratic discussion has truly been promoted in the discussions, and everyone dares to boldly raise their own questions and engage in mutual debate. For example, at the beginning, some managers listened to the rumors spread by special agents and thought that as long as you had money, you would be struggled against, and that struggle was like smoothing out bumps or cutting leeks. Through discussion based on the local situation, everyone unanimously recognized that the mass struggle against those extortionist bullies, bad landlords, and traitors was reasonable. Yuan Mingquan, the manager of the Yanliao Zhuang (paint store) in Hua Shi Street, made a clear comparison between the relationship between the head clerk and the owner, and the relationship between the tenant farmer and the landlord. He said, "If the business loses money, the loss is the owner's, and the clerk still earns the same salary. It's different for tenant farmers. If the year is good, they have to pay rent; if the year is bad, they can't even feed themselves, and they still have to pay rent. All the losses are borne by the tenant farmers. This is unreasonable and needs to be transformed!" These words inspired many managers to recognize that commercial capital is different from feudal land rent based on their own personal experience, and therefore they believed in the democratic government's policy of developing commerce. Many managers pointed out that in the past, the city's business could only prosper if the surrounding countryside had good harvests. Now that the peasants have generally turned themselves around and become prosperous, their purchasing power has increased, and business will definitely get better. After the discussion, they all said, "Now I feel much more relieved!" Many businessmen are vying to buy Chairman Mao's "On Coalition Government" and are stepping up their studies.

　　邢台五千商人
    热心学习时事政策
    认识了自己的前途，都愿努力发展商业。
    【本报邢台讯】自上月起，邢市各街商号经理、二经理、店员都热烈参加时事政策学习，利用晚间分别座谈时事与政策。仅西大街就有经理二百一十九人、二经理三百四十人、店员一百一十七人参加，全市合计，在五千人以上。座谈中真正发扬了自由思想、民主讨论的精神，各人都敢于大胆提出自己的疑问，互相展开争辩。如开始有的经理听了特务的造谣，认为只要有钱就斗，斗争是平疙瘩割韭菜，讨论中根据本地实况，大家才一致认识到群众斗争那些讹诈人的恶霸、坏地主、汉奸等是合理的。花市街颜料庄经理袁明泉把领东掌柜与东家的关系，和佃户与地主的关系作了明显的比较。他说：“买卖赔了钱，损失是东家的，掌柜吃喝薪水还是一样的赚。佃户就不同了，年成好要出租，年成坏自己顾不住吃，租也还是要出，一切损失都压在佃户身上。这就是不合理，需要改造！”这话启发许多经理根据自己切身经验，认识商业资本比封建地租不同，因而相信民主政府发展商业的政策。不少经理指出过去四乡年成好，城里生意才能发财，现在农民普遍的翻身发家，增加了购买力，买卖一定会更好起来。讨论后都说：“这一下心里可宽敞了！”许多商人争着购买毛主席的“论联合政府”，正加紧学习中。
