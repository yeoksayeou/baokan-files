    Workers' Production Competition and "Love-the-Factory Movement"
    Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua Factories Increase Profits
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 5th] Since the "May Day" festival, workers in public and private factories in Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua have launched a large-scale production competition, resulting in repeated improvements in output and quality, and significant achievements in saving raw materials and equipment. Zhangjiakou Yu Feng Flour Company's daily output increased from over 230 bags to 300 bags, with the factory earning over 1 million yuan in two days (calculated at the rate of two legal tender yuan per national currency yuan). Yisheng Iron Factory has increased its output from one furnace of iron weighing over 1,000 jin every three days to one furnace of iron weighing over 2,000 jin every two days. The quality of finished products such as iron pots is more solid than before, and the cost has been greatly reduced. Xuanhua New China Pottery Company used to have more than 60 workers managing eight electric stone mills, and the stone powder ground each day was not enough for the day's use. Now, the number of workers has been reduced to 17, and production has increased sevenfold. The burning of kilns has been changed to using discarded broken coal, reducing daily coal consumption from 70,000 jin to 40,000 jin. The Jiaotong Flour Mill has consistently maintained a production plan of increasing production by 65 percent. In the Xin Chahar newspaper printing factory, binding workers used to fold an average of just over 1,000 pages per person per day, but now they fold 3,500 pages. The work efficiency of typesetting workers has doubled, and errors have been greatly reduced. Along with the great production competition, the workers' enthusiasm for learning technology has greatly increased, and they are working hard to overcome various difficulties and improve factory production conditions. After the automatic batteries of the Zhangjiakou Telephone Bureau were damaged, the workers displayed creativity and successfully tested and modified storage batteries in a short period. Workers at the Xiayuan Power Plant launched a major inspection of machine faults, discovering a total of 146 faults of various sizes, and quickly repairing all obstacles. Workers are now more familiar with the performance and effectiveness of all parts, and their technical level has greatly improved. Du Shengcai and other workers at the Xuanhua Xinhua Machinery Factory have completed the trial production of a new cotton ginning machine. The machine uses 1-2 horsepower and can fluff 60 jin of cotton from 100 jin of fine cloth. After being spun into thread, it can still be woven into blankets, socks, etc. In addition, workers have also launched "Love-the-Factory Movements" and are willing to assist the factory in various construction works. The labor-capital relationship is extremely harmonious and united. Workers at the Zhenhua Flour Mill voluntarily gave up their holidays to help the factory repair the workshop. The Desert Soap Factory originally planned to tender for the installation of steam pipes and water pipes, but because workers volunteered to do it for free, they saved the factory 150,000 yuan. Workers at the Xiayuan Power Plant used their spare time to move 338,000 bricks within ten days, helping the factory pave a walkway. Such examples are too numerous to mention.

    张垣宣化工厂利润提高
    【新华社张家口五日电】张垣宣化各公私营工厂工人，自“五一”节掀起大规模生产竞赛热潮以来，产量质量，迭有提高，节约原料器材亦有显著成绩。张市钰＠麦粉公司，每日产量由二百三十余袋，增至三百袋，厂方两日赢利一百余万元（按本币每元合法币二元）。益盛铁工厂，由三日铸一炉出铁一千余斤，现提高到两日铸一炉出铁二千余斤。所制铁锅等成品，质量较前坚固，成本反大为减低。宣化新中国窑业公司，过去六十余个工人管理八个电碾子，每天碾出的石粉不够当天使用，现在减为十七个工人生产反提高至七倍。烧窑已改用过去遗弃不用的碎煤，由每日用煤七万斤减少为四万斤。交通面粉厂则一直保持了增产百分之六十五的生产计划。新察哈尔报印刷厂装订工人过去每人每日平均摺页子一千余张，现增到三千五百张，排版工人工作效率提高一倍，错字讹误等现象大为减少。随着生产大竞赛，工人学习技术的热忱大为增高，努力克服各种困难，改进工厂生产条件。张市电话局自动电池损坏后，工人们发扬创造性，在短期内试验改装蓄电池成功。下花园发电厂工人发起机器故障大检查运动，共发现大小故障一百四十六件，迅速即将全部障碍突击修理完竣。工人对所有机件的性能和效用都较前愈益熟悉，技术水平大大提高。宣化新华机器厂工人杜生才等试制更生产花机的工作，已告完成，该机用电一至二马力，可将一百斤细布弹成絮花六十斤，纺成线后，仍可织成毯子、袜子等。此外工人们并纷纷发起“爱厂运动”，且愿协助厂方从事各种建设工作，劳资关系极为融洽、团结，振华麦粉厂工人曾自动放弃休假，帮助厂方修理车间。沙漠肥皂厂本拟招标安置汽管和自来水管，但因工人自愿免费承作，替厂方节省了十五万元。下花园发电厂工友利用工隙于旬日内搬砖三十三万八千块，帮助厂方铺设了一条甬道，此种例子不胜枚举。
