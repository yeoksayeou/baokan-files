Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 20th: Primary school education in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region has developed unprecedentedly. There are now more than 23,300 primary schools (both higher and lower levels), with 1,464,700 children enrolled. When the entire territory of Chahar Province was liberated, there were only about 1,500 primary schools; now, the number has increased to more than 6,300. The primary school education in the old base areas of Ji-Jin, which was created with difficulty during the War of Resistance, is now being further consolidated and expanded. The reasons for the rapid development of school education in the border region are: (1) The "publicly-run with government assistance" education policy has been widely implemented in the newly liberated areas. In particular, the democratic government has strived to cultivate a large number of new teachers who serve the people. (2) Based on the living conditions of the masses, diverse school systems such as full-day, half-day, midnight school, rotational teaching, and group teaching are adopted, so that the majority of children from poor families have the opportunity to attend school. (3) The content of education is closely integrated with the needs of the masses, educating children with production knowledge so that children and young people can participate in labor and help with family production. The primary schools in Laiyuan County have gained enthusiastic praise from the masses due to the increased education in production knowledge.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Han Qixiang, a folk storyteller in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, has recently been telling new stories in the villages of Suide and Mizhi. The stories he tells focus on reflecting the reality of democratic life in our border region, such as "Liu Qiao's Reunion," "Persuading People to Learn to Read," and "The Tale of Four Poor Branches," adapted from old stories, which are well received by the masses. In Mizhi, several loafers, after hearing his story "The Transformation of Loafers," resolved to learn well. In Suide and Mizhi counties, he also taught twelve blind people to tell new stories. Han Qixiang began to create new stories at the beginning of last year with the help of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Cultural Association. Over the past year, he has created dozens of stories whose content reflects the real life of the masses. He often uses folk tunes as interludes when telling stories, which are very popular among the masses. The Border Region Cultural Association has recorded his creations and has already published some of them in separate editions.

    陕甘宁边区民间艺人韩起祥，说书转变了二流子。
    【新华社张家口二十日电】晋察冀边区小学教育空前发展，现共有高初级小学二万三千三百余处，入学儿童一百四十六万四千七百名，察哈尔省全境解放时仅有小学校一千五百余处，现已增至六千三百余处，在抗战时期艰难缔造起来的冀晋老区小学教育，现也有进一步的巩固和扩展。边区学校教育迅速发展的原因：（一）“民办公助”教育方针在新解放区普遍贯彻，特别是民主政府努力培养了大批为人民服务的新师资。（二）根据群众生活情况，采取整日、半日制、午夜校、轮回教学、分组教学等多样学制，使占人口大多数贫民子弟，均获有入学机会。（三）教育内容与群众需要密切结合，教育儿童生产知识，使儿童青年参加劳动，帮助家庭生产。涞源县小学由于增加生产知识的教育，取得了群众的热烈称赞。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】陕甘宁边区民间说书艺人韩起祥，最近在绥德米脂一带乡村说新书，所说的书中，以反映我边区民主生活的现实为主题。如“刘巧团圆”，“劝人识字”及由旧书改编的“四贫梢书”等，受到群众欢迎。在米脂有几个二流子听到了他说的书“二流子转变”以后，决心学好。他在绥德米脂尔县，还教会了十二个瞎子说新书。按韩起祥系在去年初，在陕甘宁边区文协帮助之下开始创作新书的，一年多来创作了数十种，内容能反映群众现实生活，说书时常用民间小调作插曲，颇受群众欢迎，边区文协已将他的创作记录出来，并已出一部分单行本。
