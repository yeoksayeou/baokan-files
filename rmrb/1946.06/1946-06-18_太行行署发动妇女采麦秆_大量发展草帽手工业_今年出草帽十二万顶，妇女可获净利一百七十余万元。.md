    Taihang Administrative Office Mobilizes Women to Collect Wheat Stalks
    Vigorously Develops Straw Hat Handicraft Industry
    This Year, 120,000 Straw Hats are Produced, and Women Can Obtain a Net Profit of Over 1.7 Million Yuan.
    [Report from This Newspaper in Changzhi] The Taihang Administrative Office recently instructed the county governments of Li, Lu, Ping, and Hu to seize the opportunity of the wheat harvest and widely mobilize women and children to collect large quantities of wheat stalks to develop the straw hat braiding handicraft industry. According to historical records, the braiding industry has always occupied an important position in the handicraft industry of the Taihang area. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, traffic blockades and narrow sales channels had once caused it to stagnate. After the expansion of the Liberated Areas last year, it gradually rebounded. This year, 16 straw hat factories have been restored in Changzhi, Lu'an, and Li, with more than 60 workers and 40 machines, an increase of onefold compared to last year. However, this is still 60% less than before the war. This year, 420,000 finished products can be produced, an increase of three-quarters compared to last year's output. The price of braids alone can increase the income of rural women by 6 million yuan. The majority of yarn and thread used by the factories is local thread, requiring approximately 5,500 jin. In addition to capital, women can also obtain a net profit of over 1,787,500 yuan. Furthermore, according to statistics from six counties, including Licheng, Lucheng, Pingshun, Huguan, Changzhi, and Shexian, as well as some villages in Piancheng, Zuoquan, and Wuxiang, 100,000 women are already engaged in braiding production. In Beigangtou Village, Shexian County, more than 300 women are organized to braid, and from February to May, they have already earned a profit of over 426,000 yuan. However, due to the small amount of wheat stalks collected in various places last year, straw hat braids are currently in short supply, and it is difficult to buy them even at 160 yuan per jin. To this end, the Administrative Office emphasized in particular the large-scale collection of wheat stalks, and proposed that existing hat factories should vigorously train skilled workers, lead apprentices to investigate and organize the promotion of finished products, and open up markets.

    太行行署发动妇女采麦秆
    大量发展草帽手工业
    今年出草帽十二万顶，妇女可获净利一百七十余万元。
    【本报长治讯】太行行署顷指示黎、潞、平、壶等县政府抓紧麦收时机，广泛发动妇女儿童大量采集麦秆，发展草帽辫手工业。按辫业历来即在太行区手工业中占有重要地位，抗战以来交通阻塞销路不广，曾一度停滞。去年解放区扩大后，又渐抬头，今年长、潞、黎等地草帽工厂已恢复十六家，有工人六十余，机器四十架，较去年增一倍，然距战前尚差百分之六十，今年可出成品四十二万顶，较去年产量增加四分之三，辫价即可增加农村妇女收入六百万元，工厂用线绳大多数是土线，约需五千五百斤，除资本外，妇女亦可获净利一百七十八万七千五百余元，又据黎城、潞城、平顺、壶关、长治、涉县六县及偏城、左权、武乡等一部份村庄统计，已有十万妇女从事辫业生产，涉县北岗头村三百余妇女组织起来编辫，自二月到五月已获利四十二万六千余元，但因去年各地采集麦秆不多，目前草帽辫甚感缺乏，每斤百六十元尚买不到手，为此行署指示中特别强调大量采集麦秆，并提出现有帽厂应大量培养技术工人，带领徒弟调查与组织推销成品，开辟市场。
