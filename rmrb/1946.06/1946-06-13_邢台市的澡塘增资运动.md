    Xingtai City's Bathhouse Wage Increase Movement
    Wu Xiang
  "If a family has half a liter of grain, they won't let their child work in a bathhouse."
    Li Tingkui, a worker at the Xinhuachi Bathhouse, composed a song describing his suffering, including the lines: "If a family has half a liter of grain, they won't let their child work in a bathhouse." People often get a comfortable and pleasant feeling from bathhouses, but few know that bathhouse workers live in sweat and tears all year round.
    In Xingtai City's South Gate, there are four bathhouses: Yihe, Chunyuan, Yayuan, and Xinhua (there is also one in the city). Except for Xinhuachi, the owners are also the managers. The division of labor is as follows: the accountant (records the accounts), the upper-level workers (barbers), the lower-level workers (scrubbers, foot massagers), the head waiter (tea room head), the middle waiter (seat attendant), the junior waiter (child), the water boiler, the water carrier, etc. Workers' wages are divided into two types: wages and tea money (i.e., tips from customers). The upper and lower-level workers split the tips earned 50/50 with the owner. Before liberation, the head and middle waiters only earned five yuan in puppet currency per month, and the junior waiters worked for free. The amount of tea money they received was even more pitiful. Therefore, they didn't earn enough to buy a single piece of clothing in a year. Usually, meals were taken in shifts, with the first shift getting hot food, while the second and third shifts had to eat cold food. Not to mention meat, even vegetables were rarely seen. Every meal was always the bathhouse's pickled old radish pickles, which were bitter and astringent. They were almost always not full, and the enemy puppets always complained that they were not serving well, constantly beating and insulting them. The workers had a saying: "Eat some cold or hot food, suffer some tasteless injuries!"
    Hua Xilai, the stoker at Yihe Bathhouse, worked for twelve years, and never wore a new pair of shoes. Shen Liang, an upper-level worker at Yayuan Bathhouse, had the business (barbering part) pushed onto him by the owner in a famine year, and he was not given 50/50 anymore. He was only given three yuan a day. At that time, a bean cake cost ten yuan. He didn't have enough to eat, and eating only bean cakes ruined his stomach. The owner didn't care if a worker got sick. They had to find their own medicine. Therefore, they had to endure minor illnesses, and no one cared if they died from a serious illness.
    After the Eighth Route Army liberated Xingtai, these people began to be able to improve their lives.
  Wage Increase and Obstacles in Wage Increase
    District cadres individually visited several workers, and they were all willing to approach the cadres, hoping for a wage increase. But when asked about their past lives, they always spoke hesitantly, in bits and pieces, and while whispering in the ear, they would also secretly look outside from time to time. They were afraid of the owner, afraid of losing their jobs that barely kept them alive.
    The cadres invited these workers to the district office, explaining that the government would definitely stand up for everyone. Then they told all their sufferings. The leaders then proposed: "Is it okay for one person to ask for a wage increase?" and encouraged them to organize.
    After two days of "collusion," the workers from the four bathhouses formed four groups and jointly elected Li Xinsheng (head waiter of Yihe) and Zhao Gong (stoker of Chunyuan) as the captain and vice-captain. Zhao Gong said: "From now on, our bathhouses will unite as one. If the owner tries to stop one of us, we will all reason with the owner, and he will be stopped." At that time, everyone's emotions were high, but at the beginning, no one spoke about their suffering, and the meeting failed again. The next day, the group leaders were called together to review and found that the reason was that the participants were complex, and some were relatives and confidants of the owner. Everyone was still afraid that the news would leak out and the owner would hold a grudge.
    After a few more days of reorganizing the organization and brewing, the workers gradually realized that without speaking out about their suffering, there was no reason to ask for a wage increase, because if they didn't speak out about their suffering, and vaguely increased their wages, the owner would definitely spread the word that the workers were playing hooligans. If they spoke out about their suffering, everyone outside would know that the workers were really suffering, and the workers would be right, and a wage increase would be justified. At the second meeting, quite a few people spoke about their suffering, but Xing Baochang, the group leader of Yayuan Bathhouse, said: "I have no suffering, the owner treats me very well." Everyone angrily shouted: "If he has no suffering, let him go!" They immediately asked the Yayuan workers to leave the meeting, and the leaders also seized this fact to educate the workers, proposing "oppose those who pretend to be good people, oppose slick little rascals!" and encouraged everyone to use their own strength to fight for the happiness they deserve. The masses' will to fight was shown, and many people said: "Since we've torn our faces, we're not afraid of the fan!" The third meeting was to specifically calculate the accounts. Based on the spirit of improving workers' lives and taking care of the capital's profits, it was decided to increase the monthly wages of the stokers to four and a half dou of millet, the accountants, water carriers, and head waiters to four dou, the middle waiters to three dou, and the junior waiters to two dou, but no more tea money would be given, because the income from tea money had been very low since liberation. According to the average income of Yihe Bathhouse, the monthly consumption would be 35,400 yuan. According to the new standards, the wages of eleven workers would be 12,040 yuan, the three accountants 3,900 yuan, and the owner would exclusively receive 19,460 yuan, which was still a very large profit.
    After everything was prepared, the owner was invited to a meeting to reason. This meeting was very successful. The owner publicly admitted his mistakes, admitted that the workers' demands were reasonable, and immediately accepted them all. The wages of all three bathhouses were increased, and the bathhouses were responsible for the wages and medical expenses of workers who were sick for less than a month throughout the year. As long as it did not interfere with work, the owner could not interfere with the workers' activities. A bathhouse workers' union of more than fifty people was established, and Zhao Gong was elected as the chairman. However, the workers of Yayuan Bathhouse did not participate.
    After the wage increase became a reality, the workers of Yayuan Bathhouse began to change. The head waiter Wang Changming automatically led the "collusion" and came to the union to ask for help in increasing wages. He also sincerely said: "My mind wasn't clear before, I was wrong!" It turned out that Xing Baochang was the owner's "lackey." When he saw the cadres, he always said that there was no problem and refused to increase wages. When he came back from the meeting, he didn't tell everyone the truth, but said: "There's no meeting, it's just the Eighth Route Army talking again!" The government investigated, and everyone was afraid and no one dared to speak. The government and the union understood this situation and said: "A wage increase is right, but what is the reason? Without speaking out about your suffering, there is no sufficient reason!" Wang Changming then went back to lead everyone to speak out about their suffering. First was Guo Fugen, a fifteen-year-old child, who couldn't help crying as he spoke, but he kept talking. In this way, after all nineteen people spoke out with the same grief and indignation, the owner Zhang Xijiu was finally moved. He stood up and said: "I'm really sorry to you all, I've finally done something wrong to everyone. If this happened to me, I would cry too. Everyone, say what you want, and we'll do whatever is best."
    Everyone said: "Since the owner has said this, things can be handled in any way. We mainly want to speak out about our suffering and reason. When it comes to increasing wages, we have to take care of both sides, so that you can't go out of business, and we have to be able to keep our mouths shut. Working in a bathhouse is to survive!" Then they put forward the same requirements as the other three bathhouses.
    Zhang Xijiu repeatedly said: "That's great! I think that's the best!" Everyone replied: "Then let's sign a contract!"
    The meeting was a victory, and Wang Changming was elected as the new group leader. The union increased to seventy people, and Xing Baochang was sincerely educated again.
        Workers Unite, Workers and Owners Benefit
    On the day when Xingtai City held a memorial service for the martyrs who died in the "March 8th" incident, the bathhouse workers' union and the manager jointly made many blue flowers and small white flags, and commemorated the great deceased with the same grief and sorrow. In the morning, all the bathhouses ate meat and steamed buns. The manager said to the workers: "Today's meeting will definitely be long, it's too late if you don't eat well." When the workers returned from the meeting, they discussed: "The manager let us go to the meeting freely and invited us to eat good food, can we eat for free?" So, everyone decided to start working together and automatically extend their work by two hours. That night, Yihe Bathhouse alone earned more than one thousand yuan.
    In order to develop production and earn more money, the workers, under the leadership of the union, pooled shares to open a inn. The manager, fearing that everyone would not have enough funds, automatically lent out several thousand yuan or ten thousand yuan. This inn is being painted and the quilts are being sewn. It will be opened on the Dragon Boat Festival. Why is the manager so enthusiastic about the workers' inn? You can know by listening to what Zhou Kezhi, the manager of Yihe Bathhouse, says. He said to District Chief Sun several times: "Thanks to the Eighth Route Army, after the wage increase, the workers' enthusiasm has been raised, and it's really a great source of wealth."

    邢台市的澡塘增资运动
    吴象
  “家有半升粮，不让孩子干澡塘”
    馨华池工人李廷魁，编了一首歌描述自己的痛苦，其中有两句是：“家有半升粮，不让孩子干澡塘。”人们往往从澡塘中得到舒适愉快的感觉，却很少知道澡塘工人长年生活在汗和眼泪里面。
    邢市南关有益和、春园、雅园、馨华四家澡塘（城内还有一家），除作馨华池外，都是东家兼经理。下面的分工是先生（记账），做上活的（理发工人），做下活的（挫澡、捏脚），大伙计（茶房头），中伙计（看坐的），小伙计（小孩），烧水的，担水的等。工人工资分两种：工价和批茶柜（即客人给的水钱）。做上下活所赚的手工和掌柜对半批，大中伙计解放前每月只赚伪钞五元，小伙计白干不赚。批茶柜轮到他们头上的数目更少得可怜。因此，一年赚的不够穿一件衣服。平常吃饭分班轮流，第一班还可以吃到热饭，二、三班只好吃冷的了。不必说肉，蔬菜都很少见。每顿饭总是本塘渍的老萝卜咸菜，又苦又涩。几乎顿顿都吃不饱，而且敌伪总嫌他们伺侯得不好，不断给他们打骂侮辱，伙计们流行着一句话叫：“吃点冷热饭，受点没味伤！”
    益和池的烧火工人华喜来干了十二年，十二年没有穿过一双新鞋，雅园池做上活的申良，灾荒年掌柜把买卖推给他（理发部份），不和他对半分了，一天只贴他三块钱，那时候一个豆饼就要十元，他不够吃，吃不饱，而且光吃豆饼把肚子吃坏了。工人病了掌柜是不管的，吃药得自己想法。因此小病得硬挨，大病病死没人理。
    八路军解放邢台之后，这些人才开始能够改善自己的生活。
  增资与增资中的障碍
    区干部找了几个工友个别访问，他们都很愿意接近干部，希望增资。但是问到过去的生活时却总是半吞半吐，说得枝枝节节的，而且一面低声附耳的说着，一面还不时偷偷向外边看，他们怕掌柜，怕失去几乎糊不住嘴的饭碗。
    干部把这几个工友请到区公所，说明政府绝对替大家作主，于是他们什么苦也说出来了。领导上又提出：“要想增资一个人要求行不行？”启发他们去组织起来。
    经过两天的“串通”，四个澡塘的工人，组成了四个小组，并联合选举李新声（益和大伙计）赵功（春园里烧火的）为正副大队长。赵功说：“以后咱们澡塘团结成一股劲，掌柜如果卡咱们一个人，咱们大家都和掌柜讲理，他就卡关了。”当时大家情绪很高，但一开始诉苦还是没有什么人说话，会议又失败了。第二天召集组长检讨发现原因是参加会的分子复杂，有的人是掌柜的亲戚和知己，大家仍然怕风声露出去，掌柜记仇。
    又经过几天整理组织和酝酿，工人才逐渐认识到不诉苦，就没有道理提出增加工资，因为有苦不往外说，糊糊涂涂加了工资，掌柜一定宣传工人是耍无赖。诉了苦，外边人都知道工人真是苦，工人有理，增加工资是应当的。第二次开会，诉苦的人很不少了，但是雅园池的小组长邢保长却说：“俺没有苦，掌柜待俺很好。”大家都气愤地嚷着：“人家没苦，叫人家走吧！”立即叫雅园塘工人退席，领导上也抓紧这事实教育工人，提出了反对装好人，反对俏小皮！”鼓励大家用自己的力量去争取自己应享的幸福。群众的斗争意志显示出来了，许多人说：“既然抓破脸，就不怕扇子扇！”第三次开会是具体算账，大家根据改善工人生活又照顾资方获利的精神，决定烧火的每月工资提高到小米四斗半，先生，担水量，大伙计四斗，中伙计三斗，小伙计二斗，但不再批茶柜，因解放后茶钱收入很少。以益和池的平均收入计算，每月除消耗可得三万五千四百元，按新标准，十一个工人的工资是一万二千零四十元，三个先生三千九百元，掌柜独得一万九千四百六十元，利仍然是极大的。
    一切准备好之后，便请掌柜来开会说理，这次会议很成功，掌柜当众认了错，承认工人要求是合理的，立即全部接受。三个澡塘都增资了，工人全年病期在一月以内的工资和医药费，由柜上负责。只要不妨害工作，掌柜不得干涉工人活动。并成立包括五十多人的澡塘工人工会，选举赵功为会长。但是，雅园池工人没参加。
    增资成为事实之后，雅园池的工人开始发生变化，大伙计王长明自动领导“串通”，来找工会要求帮助增资。并且诚恳的说：“以前脑子没有打通，错了！”原来邢保多是掌柜的“狗腿”，他见了干部总是说没有问题，拒绝增资。开会回来也不告诉大家真话，却说：“没啥会，还不是八路军又谈了一顿！”政府调查，大家害怕，谁也不敢说，政府和工会了解了这个情形，便说：“增资是对的，但是凭什么理由呢？不诉苦就没有充分理由！”王长明便回去领导大家诉苦，首先是十五岁的小孩郭夫根，一面说一面忍不住的哭起来，但是他还在不停的说下去。就这样，十九个人都以同样悲愤的心情诉完之后，掌柜张西九终于也被感动了，他站起来说：“我真对不起你，总算我对大家办了亏心事了。这事放到我头上我也要哭的。大家说吧，怎么办好就怎么办。”
    大家都说：“既然掌柜说到这里的话，事情怎么也好办，我们主要是诉诉苦，说说理。要说增资，也得两头照顾，不能叫你不能干，我们也得糊住嘴，干澡塘就是为了活下去嘛！”于是提出与其他三个池相同的要求。
    张西九连连说：“这还不好呢！我觉得这最好了！”大家回答道：“那么咱们就订合同吧！”
    会议胜利了，王长明当选为新的小组长。工会增加到七十人，并又诚恳的教育了邢保多。
        东伙团结，东伙两利
    邢台市举行“三八”殉难烈士追悼会的那一天，澡塘工人工会和经理合做了许多蓝花和小白旗，怀着同样的悲愤和沉痛，纪念伟大的死者。早晨，各个澡塘都吃了肉和馍，经理对工友们说：“今天的会一定开得长，不吃好些太迟了项不住。”散会回来，工友们谈论道：“经理让咱们自由自在的去开会，又请咱们吃好的，咱们能白吃吗？”于是，大家决定全体下手，自动延长两小时的工作。这一夜，光是益和澡塘，就多赚了一千余元。
    工友们为了发展生产，多赚些钱，大家在工会领导下集股开客栈，经理怕大家资金不够，自动借出几千元或者一万元。这个客栈正在粉刷房间，缝制被子，端午节就可以开张了。为什么经理对工人的客栈这样热心呢？一听益和池经理周克之的话就可以知道。他对孙区长说了几次；“托八路军的福，增了资，工人干劲都提起来了，真是大发财源。”
