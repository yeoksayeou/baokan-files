Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st - Saigon dispatch: Conflicts have recently occurred on the Vietnamese-Siamese border. French and Siamese sides are making conflicting claims. According to Siamese claims, French troops crossed the Mekong River into Siamese territory twice. The French side claims that Siamese troops crossed into Vietnamese territory, carrying out provocations. It is understood that the conflict on the Vietnamese-Siamese border is related to the recent breakdown of secret Franco-Siamese talks in Saigon. The French side insisted that Siam return parts of the Cambodian and Laotian provinces annexed in 1941, but Siam, with the support of a certain country, refused the French demands.

    越暹边境发生冲突
    【新华社延安卅一日电】西贡讯：越、暹边界近发生冲突。法、暹双方互作相反的宣传。据暹方宣称：法军两次越湄公河进入暹境；法方则宣称：暹军越入越南境内，进行挑衅，据悉：越暹边界的冲突，乃与最近西贡法暹秘密谈判的破裂有关，法方坚持要暹罗归还一九四一年吞并的柬埔寨与老挝两省的一部分地区，暹罗则在某国支持下，拒绝了法方的要求。
