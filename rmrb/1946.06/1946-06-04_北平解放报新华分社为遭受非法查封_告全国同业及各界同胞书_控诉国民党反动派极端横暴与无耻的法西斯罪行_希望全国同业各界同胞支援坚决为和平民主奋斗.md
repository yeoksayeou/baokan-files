Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: "Beiping *Jiefang Ribao*, Xinhua Branch, Issues a Statement to National Colleagues and Compatriots Regarding Illegal Seizure," the full text is as follows:

To all newspapers, news agencies, and compatriots across the country, from Xinhua General Agency, Yan'an: At a time when the people of the whole country are eager for peace and unity and the implementation of political democratization, and the Kuomintang authorities are loudly proclaiming "freedom of the press" and a "truce in propaganda," our Beiping *Jiefang Ribao* and Xinhua News Agency Beiping Branch were suddenly ordered to cease publication at 2:30 a.m. today (May 29th) under the shameless pretexts of "not approved by the Central Government" and "not in accordance with the law." On the same day, at 8 p.m., the Beiping Municipal Government posted notices and seals to close them down. On the same day, as many as seventy-five newspapers, magazines, and news agencies in Beiping were ordered to cease publication. The Kuomintang authorities, in broad daylight, in the ancient cultural capital of Beiping, where the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters is located, have committed such an unprecedented and outrageous act of undermining freedom of speech and publication. How can this not make people furious? We hereby lodge a serious protest with the Kuomintang authorities! We also accuse the Kuomintang reactionaries of this extremely tyrannical and shameless fascist crime before compatriots across the country and democratic people around the world.

The Kuomintang authorities use the so-called "not approved by the Central Government" and "not in accordance with the law" as excuses to shut us down, which are completely reactionary and shameless pretexts. The Political Consultative Conference has already resolved to abolish and revise various laws restricting people's freedom. On January 28th, the Kuomintang Supreme National Defense Council also decided and ordered the publication of amendments to the Publications Law and its implementing rules (Resolution Item Ugly No. 1). It can be seen that the old Publications Law has been cancelled, and the new Publications Law has not yet been promulgated. What exactly does "not in accordance with the law" refer to? Even if we take a step back, according to the old Publications Law, it is only necessary to apply for registration in accordance with the law, without approval, to be able to publish (see Article 7 of the law). Beiping *Jiefang Ribao* and Xinhua Branch had already filled out registration forms on February 19th and March 5th respectively, and according to the old Publications Law, they had already obtained complete legal status. Therefore, the so-called "not in accordance with the law" is just an excuse for the Kuomintang authorities to undermine democratic speech, is this not clear?

The Kuomintang authorities' ban on our newspaper and more than seventy other speech organs fully exposes their consistent reactionary attempt to overthrow the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and resolutely hinder political democratization. In order to maintain and consolidate their fascist dictatorship, they do not hesitate to break their solemn promises to guarantee the four freedoms, and tear up the "freedoms of body, thought, religion, belief, speech, publication, assembly, association, residence, migration, and communication" that the people should enjoy as stipulated in the Peaceful Nation-Building Program. In coordination with their great reaction throughout the country, countless illegal searches and other acts of violating human rights have occurred in Beiping, and today this unprecedented act of undermining public opinion has occurred. Even Hitler and Mussolini would pale in comparison, which shows how cruel and dark the fascist nature of the Chinese reactionaries' rule is!

Secondly, this act of the Kuomintang authorities fully demonstrates that their so-called equality and legality for all parties is completely false. Everyone knows that Beiping *Jiefang Ribao* and Xinhua Branch are the organs of the Communist Party of China in Beiping. Our purpose is to "serve the people wholeheartedly," and "as the mouthpiece of the people, to work together with all sectors of society to devote ourselves to the sacred cause of building a new China of peace, democracy, and unity" (*Jiefang Ribao* inaugural speech). However, the Kuomintang authorities regard us as thorns in their side. Since the founding of our newspaper, we have been subjected to illegal persecution by military police and secret agents every day. They beat newspaper vendors, tore up newspapers, and on April 3rd, they illegally arrested our newspaper staff. Most shamelessly, they can allow ten or twenty of their own Kuomintang newspapers and news agencies to be "legally" established like mushrooms after rain, allowing them to fabricate rumors and slander the CCP and its leader Mao Zedong in every possible way. However, for the CCP's *Jiefang Ribao* and Xinhua News Agency, although they had applied for registration more than three months ago, and after numerous inquiries, the final reply was that they were ordered to cease publication and seal up for "not having been submitted for approval." However, some Kuomintang newspapers, such as *Xinsheng Bao*, applied for registration and publication much later than *Jiefang Ribao*, but they quickly obtained approval. There are also several special agent publications published by them that are dedicated to anti-communism and anti-democracy, such as "Political Guidance," "Liberated Areas," "Datong News," and "Temple of Heaven," which are not subject to registration procedures at all, and are still allowed to be published, and are not included in the seventy-seven banned ones. Is this called "all parties are equal before the law"? After the "April 3rd" incident, the Kuomintang authorities in Beiping repeatedly declared that they would not discriminate against the CCP's organs and CCP personnel. Is this called "not discriminating"?

Finally, we must point out that the Kuomintang authorities' launching of this illegal atrocity today is by no means accidental. When they are still resolutely expanding the civil war in the Northeast, and attempting to launch a large-scale civil war immediately in the Pingjin-Baoding triangle in North China, they must strangle the people's mouthpiece like *Jiefang Ribao* and Xinhua News Agency, so that their conspiracies are not exposed, and the people's voices have nowhere to appeal. In this way, they can unscrupulously suppress the people and let go of the civil war.

Today we have been illegally sealed up, we resolutely oppose this completely illegal and unreasonable absurd measure of the Kuomintang authorities! We hope that our colleagues and compatriots across the country will be more vigilant and urgently mobilize to support us and the seventy-five speech organs banned in Beiping today, resolutely oppose this heinous crime of the Kuomintang authorities, and fight for stopping the civil war, striving for peace, and ensuring people's rights! We firmly believe that under the unyielding efforts of the people across the country, the reactionaries' conspiracy to insist on dictatorship and civil war will be crushed, and China's peace will surely triumph. As the horn of peace and democracy, our Beiping *Jiefang Ribao* and Xinhua Branch will never be extinguished! With the support of the people across the country, we will soon meet with the vast number of readers in Pingjin and across the country in a stronger and more substantial way.

Long live the democratic freedom of the Chinese people!

Long live the new China of peace, democracy, and unity!

    北平解放报新华分社为遭受非法查封
    告全国同业及各界同胞书
    控诉国民党反动派极端横暴与无耻的法西斯罪行
    希望全国同业各界同胞支援坚决为和平民主奋斗
    【新华社延安一日电】“北平解放报，新华分社为遭受非法查封，告全国同业及各界同胞书”，全文如下：
    延安新华总社转全国各报馆、各通讯社，及全国各界同胞公鉴：当全国人民渴望和平团结，实行政治民主化，国民党当局高声宣称“新闻自由”，“宣传休战”的今天，我们北平解放报和新华通讯社北平分社，突于今日（五月二十九日）上午二时半夜深，被国民党当局在所谓“未经中央核准”“于法不合”的无耻借口下，勒令停刊，并于当天下午八时，由北平市政府贴上布告和封条查封了；而在同一天内，北平报纸杂志通讯社被勒令停刊者，竟达七十五家之多。国民党当局在光天化日之下，在文化古都军事调处执行部所在地的北平，竟干出如此无法无天史无前例的摧残言论出版机关的暴行来，怎不令人发指眦裂！？我们为此特向国民党当局提出严重抗议！并在全国同胞和全世界民主人士面前，控诉国民党反动派这一极端横暴与无耻的法西斯罪行。
    国民党当局以所谓“未经中央核准”“于法不合”的罪名来查封我们，这完全是反动的无耻借口。政治协商会议早已决议，废止和修正各项限制人民自由的法令，一月二十八日国民党最高国防委员会也已决定，并命令公布修正了出版法及其施行细则（决议丑项一则），可知旧出版法业已取消，新出版法迄未颁布，试问“于法不合”究竟指的是什么法？退一万步说，即使按照旧出版法规定，亦只须依法申请登记，不必核准，即得发行（见该法第七条）。北平解放报和新华分社，早在二月十九日及三月五日，先后依法填表申请登记，照旧出版法，亦早已取得了完全的合法地位，因此，所谓“于法不合”，只是国民党当局摧残民主言论的一种借口，这还不明白么？
    国民党当局此次查禁本报社和其他七十多家言论机关，充分暴露了他们一贯要推翻政协决议，全力阻难政治民主化的反动企图。他们为了保持和巩固其法西斯独裁，就不惜自食其保证四大自由的庄严诺言，撕毁和平建国纲领所规定的人民所应享有的“身体、思想、宗教、信仰、言论、出版、集会、结社、居住、迁徙、通讯之自由”。配合着他们在全国的大反动，他们在北平先后发生了无数次非法搜捕及其他侵犯人权的行动，而到今天竟发生这一旷古未有的摧残舆论的大暴行，希特勒、墨索里尼且亦望尘莫及，这就说明了中国反动派统治的法西斯本质，是何等残忍和黑暗！
    其次，国民党当局这一暴行，又充分说明了他们所允诺的所谓党派平等合法，完全是一句假话。谁都知道，北平解放报和新华分社，是中国共产党在北平的机关报和机关通讯社，我们的宗旨，是“全心全意为人民服务”，是“作为人民的喉舌，来和各界同胞共同勉励，以致力于和平民主团结建设新中国的神圣事业”（解放报发刊词），但国民党当局，却把我们当作眼中钉，自从本报创刊以后，就没有一天不遭受军警宪特的非法迫害，他们殴打报贩，撕毁报纸，四月三日更非法搜捕我报社工作人员，而最无耻的，他们可以容许十家二十家国民党自己的报纸通讯社象雨后春笋一样“合法”的办出来，让他们对中共及其领袖毛泽东百般造谣污蔑，而对于中共的解放报和新华社，虽早在三个多月前已申请登记，其间又经过多少次的催询，而最后的答复，则是“未经呈准登记”而勒令停刊和查封，但若干国民党报纸如新生报等，申请登记和出版比解放报迟得多，但它们却很快获得了呈准。还有几种他们出版的专以反共反民主为职志的特务性刊物，如“政治向导”“解放区”“大同新闻”“天坛”等，就根本不经登记手续，而仍准予出刊，并未列入被查禁的七十七家之内，难道这就叫做“各党派在法律前一律平等”？当“四三”事件之后，北平国民党当局一再宣称，对中共机关报和中共人员，决不歧视，如此作为，难道就叫做“并不歧视”么？
    最后，我们必须指出：国民党当局之在今天发动这一非法暴行，决不是偶然的，当他们今天仍然在东北坚决扩大内战，在华北首先是平、津、保三角地带企图立即发动大规模内战的时候，他们就必须扼杀如同解放报和新华社一样的人民喉舌，使他们的阴谋无人揭露，使人民的呼声无处可申诉，这样他们就可以肆无忌惮地镇压人民，放手进行内战。
    今天我们是被非法查封了，我们坚决反对国民党当局这一完全非法无理的荒谬措施！我们希望全国同业和各界同胞更加警觉起来，和紧急动员起来，支援我们和北平今天被查禁的七十五家言论机关，坚决反对国民党当局这一滔天罪行，为停止内战、争取和平、确保人民权利而奋斗！我们坚决相信，在全国人民不屈不挠的努力下，反动派坚持独裁内战的阴谋一定被粉碎，中国和平一定能胜利。作为和平民主之号角的我们北平解放报和新华分社，是永远扑灭不了的！在全国人民的支援下，我们一定不久就会更加坚强和更加充实地与平津和全国广大读者见面。
    中国人民的民主自由万岁！
    和平民主团结的新中国万岁！
