Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 30th. The Northeast Daily recently published an editorial entitled "Solving the Land Problem is the Central Link in Deepening the Mass Movement," stating:

    Experience from various regions in distributing enemy and puppet land has confirmed that "the central link in mobilizing the masses is solving the land problem."

    Because the vast majority of peasants (including tenant farmers, farm laborers, poor peasants, middle peasants, and rich peasants) each received an average of three to six mu of land, with an annual harvest of more than three shi of grain per person, the rural economy has undergone a fundamental change. The economic status of the broad masses of peasants has generally risen, realizing Sun Yat-sen's ideal of "land to the tiller," which has broken the policy of "cities ruling the countryside" and "prosperous cities, impoverished rural areas" under the puppet Manchukuo regime. Due to rural prosperity, improved peasant livelihoods, and increased productivity and purchasing power, it is possible to provide cities and industries with sufficient grain and raw materials, opening up vast markets for the continued development of industry.

    Based on the experience of land distribution in various regions, the editorial put forward the following suggestions for future reference in continuing to solve the land problem: (1) Boldly and freely not only reduce rent and interest, but also focus the movement on resolutely supporting peasants in distributing enemy and puppet land, so that peasants can obtain land. (2) In the movement, not only should poor peasants, farm laborers, and the poor actively participate, but all methods should be used to enable the vast majority of peasants to participate in this movement and benefit from it. The interests of middle peasants must never be violated. The entire movement must obtain the consent and satisfaction of all middle peasants (including wealthy middle peasants). (3) Generally, the land of rich peasants should not be changed, but if the rich peasants' cultivated land is entirely Mantuo land or Kaituo land ("Kaituo land" refers to land seized from the people by the Japanese. "Mantuo land" refers to land seized in the name of "Manchukuo.") and the land of major traitors, rich peasants must also receive a share when distributing land. (4) In areas where the distribution of enemy, puppet, and traitor land has not yet been launched, the masses should be quickly mobilized to solve the land problem.

    The editorial requires all comrades to grasp two principles when carrying out this work: first, to ensure that the majority of poor peasants benefit; second, to truly mobilize the masses, organize the masses, transform the regime, and develop peasant self-defense armed forces.

    东北日报著论
    解决土地问题
    是深入群运的中心环节
    【新华社哈尔滨三十日电】东北日报日前以“解决土地问题，是深入群众运动的中心环节”为题，发表社论称：
    从各地分配敌伪土地的经验证实了“发动群众的中心环节，是解决土地问题”。
    由于绝大多数的农民（包括佃农、雇农、贫农、中农和富农）每人平均分得三亩到六亩土地，每年每人可收获三石以上的粮食，这样一来，农村经济就发生了根本变化。广大农民经济普遍上升，实现了孙中山的“耕者有其田”的理想，就打破了伪满时以“城市统治乡村”，“富城市、贫农村”的政策。由于农村繁荣，农民生活改喜，生产力和购卖力提高，这样就可能为城市和工业供给充足的粮食和原料，工业的继续发展开辟了广大的市场。
    根据各地分配土地的经验，该社论提出下列几点意见，为今后继续解决土地问题的参考：（一）大胆放手不仅要减租减息，而且要把运动的中心放在坚决拥护农民分配敌伪土地，这样使农民获得土地。（二）在运动中不仅要使贫、雇农、贫民，积极参加，而且要用一切方法，使绝大多数农民参加这一运动，并要使其获得利益，绝不可侵犯中农的利益。整个运动，必须取得全体中农的同意和满意（包括富裕中农）。（三）一般不变动富农的土地，但富农如其耕地全部为满拓地、开拓地（“开拓地”乃日人从人民手中夺去的土地。“满拓地”系用“满洲国”名义夺去者。）和大汉奸之土地，在分地时，富农也须分得一份。（四）在尚未发动分配敌伪汉奸土地的地区，应迅速发动群众起来，解决土地问题。
    该社论要求所有同志在执行这一工作时，必须掌握两个原则：第一是要使最多数的贫苦农民获得利益。第二是能真正发动群众，组织群众，改造政权，发展农民自卫武装。
