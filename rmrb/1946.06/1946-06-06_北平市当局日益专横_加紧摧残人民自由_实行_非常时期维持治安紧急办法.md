Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd. Peiping dispatch: The Peiping municipal authorities' announcement of the implementation of the so-called "Emergency Measures for Maintaining Public Security in Extraordinary Times" and the establishment of a "National Identification Card" system has caused great anxiety and dissatisfaction among the citizens. General public opinion believes that this is a revival of the "Emergency Law for the Punishment of Crimes Endangering the Republic of China" during the civil war and an inheritance of the Japanese invaders' "identification card" system. The "Emergency Measures for Maintaining Public Security in Extraordinary Times" were announced on the 24th in the name of Zhu Weiping, Deputy Director of the Police Bureau, and consist of eight articles. The first three articles are: (1) In the event of "disturbing order," "inciting riots," "sabotaging traffic," or other events that "endanger" the country, the military and police may use force or other effective methods to stop them. (2) In the event of any act of crime as described in the preceding paragraph being committed through writing, books, speeches, or other methods, the perpetrator may be arrested on the spot, and resistance may be overcome by force or other effective methods if necessary. (3) The military and police shall immediately disband any gatherings or parades that "impede" order or "incite" the public, and may arrest the ringleaders and those who resist disbandment. At the same time, Zheng Tao, Chief Secretary of the Police Bureau, stated: "Peiping will implement the 'National Identification Card' system in mid-June, which is expected to be completed in three months. The identification card will have eight or ten pages, detailing changes of household registration and whether the person has committed a criminal offense. Those over the age of fourteen must provide both fingerprints and a photograph. Those over the age of five need only provide fingerprints." He also said, "The cost of printing the identification cards will be 150 million to 200 million yuan." In response, leaders of the China Democratic League, Zhang Shenfu and Liu Qingyang, and Professor Jiang Shaoyuan, among others, have strongly criticized these measures. Zhang stated: "These measures, in a word, are 'disturbing,' disturbing the people, disturbing public security, and moreover, they violate the world trend and hinder democracy." Liu Qingyang said: "The authorities announce four promises on the one hand, and on the other hand, they promulgate many laws that hinder the people's freedom. This approach is unworkable." Jiang Shaoyuan said: He called on the people to unite and oppose these measures that endanger the people's freedom.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Peiping: Yesterday, Chiang Kai-shek issued 500,000 yuan to the Peiping Police Bureau, saying it was "to reward their outstanding service achievements since the recovery." According to investigations, the recent "outstanding service achievements" of the Peiping Police Bureau include the arrest of personnel from the *Jiefang* (Liberation) Newspaper, the Xinhua branch, and Chief of Staff Teng's residence on April 3rd, followed by the arrest of more than 4,000 citizens over the next few nights; the condoning of thugs to create the Zhongshan Park bloodbath on April 21st and the release of the murderer Liu Chengyun; the dispatch of a large number of police to monitor the workers' commemoration on "May 1st" Labor Day; and the ordered closure of seventy-seven media organizations on the 29th of last month.

    加紧摧残人民自由
    实行“非常时期维持治安紧急办法”
    【新华社延安三日电】北平航讯：平市当局，宣布实行所谓“非常时期维持治安紧急办法”与举办“国民身份证”制，引起市民极大不安与不满。一般社会舆论，认为这是内战时期“危害民国紧急治罪法”的复活，与日寇“身份证”制的承袭。“非常时期维持治安紧急办法”，系以警局副局长祝维平名义于二十四日宣布，共分八条，其前三条为：（一）遇有“扰乱秩序”“鼓煽暴动”“破坏交通”以及其他“危害”国家之事变发生时，军警得以武力或其他有效方法制止。（二）遇有以文字、图书、演说，或其他方法而为前项犯罪之事实者，得当场逮捕，并将于必要时，以武力或其他有效方法排除其抵拒。（三）军警遇有“妨害”秩序“煽惑”民众之集会游行，立予解散，并得逮捕首谋者，及抵抗解散之人。与此同时，警局主任秘书郑涛谈称：“平市六月中，将举办‘国民身份证’，预计三个月办竣。该项身份证计八页或十页，其中对于转移户口，及曾犯刑事罪与否，均记载较详。十四岁以上者，指纹与照片两种皆须具备。五岁以上者，有指纹即可。并谓“该项身份证纸张印刷费，需一万万五千万至二千万万元。”对此，民盟负责人张申府、刘清扬与教授江绍原等，纷纷加以抨击。张氏称：“这些办法，用一个字说来，就是‘扰’，扰乱人民，扰乱治安，而且违背世界潮流，妨害民主”。刘清扬说：“上边宣布了四项诺言，下边又颁布许多妨害人民自由的法令，这种办法是行不通的。”江绍原称：他呼吁人民联合起来，反对这种危害人民自由的措施。
    【新华社延安三日电】据中央社北平讯：昨天蒋介石发给北平警察局五十万元，说是“以奖励光复以来之优异服务成绩”。据调查，北平警局最近“优异服务成绩”之荦荦大者，即有四月三日逮捕解放报社、新华分社、及滕参谋长公馆人员，接着几夜逮捕市民四千余人，放纵暴徒造成四月二十一日中山公园血案，并释放凶手刘成云，“五一”节派大批警察监视工人的纪念会，以及上月二十九日之奉命封闭七十七家言论机关。
