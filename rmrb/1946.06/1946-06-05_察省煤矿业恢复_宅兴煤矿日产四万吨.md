Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 31st - In the Xi Huayuan mining area of Charhar Province, more than 80 large and small coal mines have now resumed operation. Among them, the largest, the Zhaixing Coal Mine, has a total of four mine shafts and currently has a total of 144.366 million yuan in private shares. To support the mine's expansion, the government has invested 30.74 million yuan, increasing the number of miners to more than 500. The average daily coal production is around 40,000 tons. With the government's care and encouragement of low-interest loans of more than 40 million yuan, the small coal kilns established by the masses through shareholding have now developed to more than 80, scattered on the foothills around Xi Huayuan. According to statistics from the 427 kilns near Baoxing alone, the daily output reaches more than 3,000 tons, and the masses are making huge profits. For example, the Yimin Coal Kiln, established in October last year, has a total of 50 shares, totaling more than 100,000 yuan. After four months of operation, the private shareholders received 6 dou of millet as dividends. Now, each share with an original value of 2,000 yuan has been fully returned to the shareholders. After expenses, the kiln can earn a net profit of more than 10,000 yuan per day. The mass coal mining movement is still continuing to expand on a large scale. However, most small kilns lack long-term plans, and the democratic government is starting by strengthening technical guidance to help each kiln improve its operating conditions.

    察省煤矿业恢复
    宅兴煤矿日产四万吨
    【新华社宣化三十一日电】察省下花园矿区，现已有八十余座大小煤矿恢复开采，就中规模最大的宅兴煤矿，共拥有四个矿井，现共有民股一万万四千三百六十六万元。政府为扶助该矿扩大经营，投资三千万七百四十万元，矿工增至五百余人，每日产煤平均在四万吨上下。在政府照顾与低利贷款四千余万元奖励扶助下，群众集股兴办的小煤窑，现已发展到八十多座，散布于下花园四周山麓上，仅据宝兴附近四百二十七座窑统计，每日产量即达三千余吨，群众获利极巨。例如去年十月兴办的益民煤窑，共有资金五十股，合十万余元，经营四个月后，民股分红小米六斗，现每股原本二千元，已悉数退回股东。该窑除开支外，每日可获净利万余元，现群众性的采煤运动，尚在继续大量扩展中，惟一般小窑多缺乏长期计划，民主政府正从加强技术指导着手，帮助各窑改善经营状况。
