Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: The unprecedented outrage of the Kuomintang fascist faction illegally closing the Beiping *Liberation Daily* Xinhua Branch and seventy-seven other newspapers, magazines, and news agencies in Beiping has sparked united anger in news and cultural circles in the liberated areas. In addition to previously reported protests, telegrams of protest have continued to arrive from news and cultural circles in the Shandong, Jin-Cha-Ji, Central China, and Jin-Sui liberated areas. The Shandong telegram stated: "This is a re-enactment of Qin Shi Huang's burning of books and burying of scholars, the resurrection of Hitler, and a signal for the Kuomintang fascist faction to launch a full-scale civil war. If this fascist plague is allowed to spread unchecked, the entire China will become a barbaric land devoid of just voices and progressive culture." At the same time, it resolutely stated, "As long as we have our pens, we will write the contemporary *Spring and Autumn Annals*; as long as we have our throats, we will shout out the voices of the people." The Jin-Cha-Ji telegram stated: "This is an open declaration by the Kuomintang authorities to completely tear up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and a direct declaration of war against peace and democracy." "The Kuomintang authorities are attempting to block the people's ears, eyes, hearts, throats, and tongues to facilitate launching a full-scale civil war without any scruples." The Central China telegram stated: "This shocking and absurd crime further demonstrates that the Kuomintang authorities know that fabrication and slander are not enough to win people's trust, so they simply prohibit the people from speaking." The Jin-Sui telegram stated: "This event, more thoroughly than any previous similar event, has torn off the pseudo-peace and democracy mask of the fascist faction, allowing the people of the whole country to see their ugly true face more clearly." They unanimously called on news and cultural circles and all democrats throughout the country to be vigilant, unite, and not only protest but also take practical actions to defend the democratic and progressive news and cultural undertakings and to fight to the death to resist and stop the fascist beasts' offensive. The signatories to the above telegrams include the Jin-Cha-Ji branch of the Liberated Area Journalists Association, the Jin-Cha-Ji General Branch of the Xinhua News Agency, and the Ji-Zhong, Ji-Jin, Ji-Dong, Ji-Re-Liao, and Chahar branches, the *Jin-Cha-Ji Daily*, the *Chahar Daily*, the *Ji-Zhong Guide*, the *Ji-Jin Daily*, the *Ji-Dong Daily*, the *Ji-Re-Liao Daily*, the *Military Region Soldiers' Daily*, the *Border Region Masses' Daily*, the *Inner Mongolia Weekly*, the *Workers' Daily*, the *Era Youth Society*, the *Northern Culture Society*, and the Zhangjiakou branch of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Shandong includes the Shandong General Branch of the Xinhua News Agency and its branches, the *Shandong Dazhong Daily*, the *Jiaodong Dazhong Daily*, the *Binhai Rural Society*, the *Bohai Daily*, the *Lunan Times*, the *Luzhong Dazhong Society*, the *Xinwei Daily*, and the *Islamic Daily*. Jin-Sui includes the Jin-Sui Branch of the Xinhua News Agency, the *Anti-Japanese War Daily*, the *Dazhong Daily*, the *People's Era Society*, the *People's Pictorial Society*, and the Lvliang Publishing House.
