Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 12th: The officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang's 184th Division, who gloriously revolted against the civil war on the Haicheng front, have received the utmost respect and welcome from the broad masses of the people in Northeast China. On June 3rd, when Division Commander Pan passed through Xiuyan City, eighty kilometers southeast of Haicheng, the streets and alleys were packed with people. Pine arches adorned with paper flowers were erected everywhere on the streets, and the national flag fluttered in front of every household. Slogans welcoming Division Commander Pan were pasted along the road, and the welcoming procession of over ten thousand people stretched for more than five *li* to the Dayang Bridge in the north of the city. People had been waiting since after breakfast, and it wasn't until around 1:30 PM that the uprising troops arrived. At this time, the military band of the Joint Middle School played even louder, and the *yangge* dance troupes were particularly lively. As the soldiers of the 184th Division passed through the crowd, the masses continuously shouted slogans such as "Welcome the Glorious Uprising of the 184th Division" and "Welcome the 184th Division for Turning its Guns Against the Civil War." Many people stuffed the soldiers' hands with eggs and cigarettes that they had prepared in advance. Some soldiers walked by too quickly with empty hands, so the masses chased after them and stuffed the items into their pockets. The soldiers all showed smiles of comfort and nodded to the masses in thanks. When the responsible comrades of various organizations accompanied Division Commander Pan, they were immediately surrounded by the masses. Their representatives presented flowers to Division Commander Pan. The loud military music was interspersed with cheering slogans. The distant masses craned their necks and inquired about who was Division Commander Pan, the one who advocated for peace and opposed the civil war.

    群众争送慰劳品向潘师长献花
    【新华社安东十二日电】海城前线光荣举义反对内战的国民党军一八四师官兵，受到东北广大人民最大的尊敬和欢迎。六月三日，潘师长路过海城东南面八十公里的岫岩城时，街头巷尾挤满了人，街上到处搭起满插纸花的松门，家家户户门前飘扬着国旗，沿路贴满了欢迎潘师长的标语，万余人的欢迎行列，延长到城北五里多路的大洋桥头。早饭后人们就在等候着，直等到午后一点半钟光景，举义的队伍开来了，这时联合中学的军乐声，更响亮了，秧歌队也特别活跃。当一八四师士兵们从人群中通过时，群众不断高呼“欢迎光荣起义的一八四师”，“欢迎一八四师调转枪口反对内战”等口号。许多群众把早已准备好了的鸡子烟卷，塞到士兵们的手里，有的士兵走的太快，空手走过去了，群众就追上去塞到他们的口袋里。士兵们都现出得到安慰的微笑，不断的向群众点头答谢。当各机关负责同志陪着潘师长走过时，立刻被群众围住了，他们的代表向潘师长献花，响亮的军乐声中，夹杂着欢呼的口号声，远处的群众翘首而望，互相询问着那一个是主张和平反对内战的潘师长。
