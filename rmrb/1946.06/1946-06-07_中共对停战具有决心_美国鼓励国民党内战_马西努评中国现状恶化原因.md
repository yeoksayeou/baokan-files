Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: According to Moscow Broadcasting commentator Masinu, in a talk on the China issue broadcast on the 3rd, he concluded: "The further deterioration of the situation in China and the increasing expansion of the civil war are due to the concrete decision on US loans to China after the talks between Soong Tzu-wen and Marshall." Masinu pointed out: Chinese democrats unanimously demand an immediate end to the civil war, and the CCP is fully determined to stop the civil war. The voluntary withdrawal from Changchun once again proves this fact. Mr. Ma corroborated a New York broadcast stating: The Kuomintang authorities are trying to occupy Manchuria by force as a prerequisite for stopping the civil war. Mr. Ma then exposed the fact that the US military authorities were providing military assistance to the Kuomintang army attacking the Northeast, and its purpose: "Now that the Kuomintang has made slight progress after suffering great losses, American businessmen have come to the fore. Paulley, representing their interests, announced in Nanjing: He is prepared to establish his own base in Shenyang as much as possible, and use American experts and technicians to study Manchuria's natural resources. Shanghai journalists regard this statement as the real purpose of the Americans' helping the Kuomintang to attack Manchuria. Chinese democrats pointed out: The Soviet Red Army took Manchuria back from the Japanese invaders in order to hand it over to its true owner - the residents of Manchuria, not for American businessmen to take it into their own hands. Some American newspapers have gone crazy because the Kuomintang army trained and equipped by the United States is attacking Manchuria. These newspapers recently openly described some of the US authorities' plans. The American "Newsweek" said on the 3rd: "Manchuria is the new border of the United States." Mr. Ma then refuted the anti-Soviet rumor published in the Shanghai Shen Bao that a hundred Soviet officers were training artillery for the CCP and supplying weapons in Jiaodong. He pointed out that anyone who knows a little about the current situation in China knows that the CCP does not need the help of Soviet officers. In the victorious struggle against the regular Japanese army for 14 years, the CCP army has defeated the Japanese army every time in Manchuria, North China, and Central China. The combat effectiveness and modern weapons possessed by the Japanese army are much higher than those of the Kuomintang army (including those trained and equipped by the United States). Mr. Ma exposed that the purpose of this kind of rumor-mongering is twofold: (1) to try to cover up the fact that the United States is helping the Kuomintang; (2) to try to enhance the prestige of the Kuomintang generals and their army, and American advisors, who have lost their prestige in the Siping Street battle. Everyone knows that in the Battle of Siping Street, the People's Revolutionary Army repeatedly repelled the fierce attacks of the Kuomintang army with superior forces trained and equipped by the United States for more than a month, causing them huge losses. The Chinese People's Revolutionary Army only withdrew from Siping Street after receiving an order from the Commander-in-Chief.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: Associated Press, Washington, 2nd: American "Modern Industry" magazine stated: "China and India were once regarded as the largest markets for American wartime commodities, but the two countries failed to guarantee this hope." The magazine stated: "In these two countries, irreconcilable views are in conflict. Unless the differences are eliminated, it is impossible to move towards full industrialization, and therefore become the largest employer of American industrial equipment." The magazine continued: "The CCP has reached out to reach an agreement, but the Kuomintang is unwilling and still realize their dream of unifying China." The magazine concluded: "The wartime expectation of China actually purchasing peacetime equipment now needs to be discounted."

    中共对停战具有决心
    美国鼓励国民党内战
    马西努评中国现状恶化原因
    【新华社延安四日电】据莫斯科广播评论员马西努，三日发表关于中国问题的谈话，其结语称：“中国现状之更加恶化，和内战之愈趋扩大，其原因是由于宋子文与马歇尔会谈后，美国对华贷款业已具体决定”。马西努指出：中国民主人士一致要求立即停止内战，中共对停止内战却有充分决心。自动退出长春，再次证明了这一事实。马氏对证纽约广播称：但国民党当局则力图以武力占领满洲、作为停止内战的先决条件。马氏继即揭露了美军当局给进攻东北的国民党军以军事援助的事实及其目的称：“现在国民党在遭受极大损失，得以稍微向前进展后，美国买卖人便都出台了。代表它们利益的鲍莱在南京宣布：准备尽量在沈阳建立自己的根据地，用美国的专家与技师，研究满洲的天然富源。上海新闻记者都把这一声明看作是美国人帮助国民党进攻满洲的真正目的。中国民主人士指出：苏联红军将满洲从日寇手里夺回来，是为了要把它转交给它的真正主人——满洲居民，而不是为了美国买卖人把它拿到自已手里。美国某些报纸，已因美国训练与装备的国民党军队向满洲之进攻而疯狂起来。这些报纸最近公开叙述美当局的某些计划。美国新闻周报三日说：“满洲是美国的新国界”。马氏继即驳斥上海申报登载有百名苏联军官，在胶东为中共训练炮兵与供给武器的反苏谣言。他指出凡是稍懂得中国现状的人，都深知中共不需要苏联军官的帮助。中共军队十四年来在反抗日本正规军的胜利斗争中，在满洲、华北与华中，每次都击溃了日军。日军所具备的战斗力与近代武器，都比国民党军（包括美国训练与装备在内）不知要高明多少倍。马氏揭露此种造谣之目的有二：（１）力图掩盖美国帮助国民党的事实；（２）企图提高在四平街战役中业已威信扫地的国民党将军及其军队，以及美国顾问的威望。大家知道，在四平街战役中，人民革命军曾在一月余长时间内，多次击退美国训练与装备的优势兵力的国民党军之猛烈进攻，使他们受到巨大损失，中国人民革命军只是在奉到总司令命令后才退出四平街。
    【新华社延安四日电】美联社华盛顿二日讯：美《现代工业》杂志称：“中国和印度，曾被视为美国战役商品的最大市场，但二国未能保证这方面的希望”。该杂志称：“在这二个国家中，不可调和的观点正在冲突中，除非分歧消除，否则没有可能向充分工业化之途迈进，因此而成为美工业装备的最大雇主”。杂志继称：“中共已伸出手来要求达成协议，但国民党不愿意，仍然实现他们统一中国的梦想”。杂志结语称：“战时对中国实际上购买平时装备的预计，现在需要打些折扣”。
