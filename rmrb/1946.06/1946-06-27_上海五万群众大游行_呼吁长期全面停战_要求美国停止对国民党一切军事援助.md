　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 24th: According to foreign news agencies' reports from Shanghai on June 23rd: A large-scale anti-civil war demonstration of 50,000 people broke out in Shanghai. Following the anti-civil war demonstrations by over 14,000 students in Suzhou and Hangzhou, over 50,000 people in Shanghai gathered in a square near the train station, and then marched into the city in formation, chanting slogans along the way such as "Oppose Civil War," "Demand a Long-Term and Comprehensive Ceasefire," "Demand Peace," "Demand the United States Not to Interfere in China's Internal Affairs," and "Demand the Immediate Withdrawal of American Troops Stationed in China and Stop All Military Aid to the Kuomintang." At the same time, they distributed leaflets and slogans, set off firecrackers, and combined with loud and magnificent songs, shaking the entire city! The citizens were moved by the marching procession along the roads, with thunderous applause! Countless citizens even followed closely behind the marching procession, temporarily joining the demonstration. The masses also requested the dispatch of a delegation of ten people to Nanjing, to petition the authorities, Marshall, and the Three-Person Committee. This delegation includes representatives from various people's organizations such as industry, academia, and commerce in Shanghai.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 24th: The North China General Branch of the Democratic League News Agency reported: The person in charge of the Democratic League in Beiping stated on the 10th that what the people of the whole country demand is not the cessation of conflict, but peace and unity; not temporary, but permanent; not limited-time negotiations, but fundamental sincerity. Regarding the issue of American aid to China, the person in charge said: We welcome American mediation; but we believe that all other American policies towards China must closely correspond with its mediation efforts. For example, loans to China, military lending bills, and the navy replacing China in transporting troops, etc., if China has not achieved peaceful unification through consultation, it will inevitably delay the progress of mediation or cause twists and turns. If changed to after peace, there will be no problem. Therefore, a slight carelessness will, on the one hand, aggravate domestic disputes, and on the other hand, arouse international suspicion. Therefore, it is hoped that the American government and public will deeply understand that obtaining American aid before peace is only the mentality of a portion of selfish Chinese people, because the change in American attitude affects the smooth progress of China's peace negotiations.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 24th: Hangzhou reported: In order to call for a long-term ceasefire and demand improved treatment, professors at Zhejiang University went on strike on the 8th of this month and sent representatives to Shanghai to contact professors from various universities to petition in Nanjing. At the same time, the Professors' Association issued a declaration, calling for support from all sectors of society. The declaration refutes the "Measures for Adjusting the Treatment of Public School Teachers and Staff" passed by the Nanjing National Defense Conference on the 5th of this month, pointing out that this method is an attempt by a group of government officials to realize their private ambitions of expanding bureaucratic capital and cultivating factional forces. At the same time, it questioned the Executive Yuan's absurd statement that it could not improve treatment because the national treasury was depleted: "If it is said that the national treasury is depleted and cannot bear the burden, then where did the funds the government has spent on the civil war in the past few months come from? Is it that even a year after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, a large sum of money must be reserved for civil war preparation?" It also stated: "Today, we can no longer tighten our belts to support the government's internal operations!" The declaration calls on public school teachers and staff across the country, and compatriots across the country, to unite and work hard to promote a long-term ceasefire!

　　上海五万群众大游行
    呼吁长期全面停战
    要求美国停止对国民党一切军事援助
    【新华社延安二十四日电】据外国通讯社上海二十三日电：沪市爆发五万人的反内战大游行。继苏杭两地一万四千余学生反内战大游行后，沪市五万余群众集合于火车站附近广场上，然后列队进入市内游行，沿途高呼：“反对内战”，“要求长期全面停战”，“要求和平”，“要求美国不干涉中国内政”，“要求驻华美军立即撤退，并停止对国民党一切军事援助”等口号；同时散发传单标语，燃放爆竹，结合嘹亮雄壮的歌声，震撼全市！游行队伍所经马路，市民均为感动，掌声雷鸣！更有无数市民，紧随游行队伍后面，临时参加游行示威，群众并要求派遣由十个人组成之代表团，前往南京，向当局与马歇尔及三人委员会请愿，此项代表包括上海工、学、商等各界人民团体。
    【新华社延安二十四日电】民主同盟华北总支部新闻处讯：民主同盟北平负责人十日发言称：全国人民要求的不是停止冲突，而是和平团结，不是暂时的，而是永远的，不是限期谈判，而是根本诚意。关于美国援华问题，该负责人说：美国的调停，是我们所欢迎的；但我们以为美国其他一切对华政策，必须与其调停工作密切相应合。例如：对华借款，军事上的借款法案，以及海军代替中国运兵等等，若在中国未得协商的和平统一以前，必致反使调停进行迟缓，或生波折。若改在和平以后，即无问题。故此稍一不慎，便会一方面加重国内纠纷，他方面引起国际猜疑。故望美国朝野，深切了解，使未得和平以前取得美国援助，只是一部分自私心的中国人的心理，因为美国态度的迁移，影响中国和平协商顺利与否。
    【新华社南京二十四日电】杭州讯：浙大教授为呼吁长期停战，要求改善待遇，特于本月八日全体停教，并派代表去沪，联络各大学教授赴京请愿。同时有教授会发表宣言，呼吁各界声援。该宣言驳斥本月五日南京国防会议通过之调整公教人员待遇办法，指出这一办法，系一批政府官员遂其私人伸张官僚资本培植派系势力之企图，同时对行政院托辞不能提高待遇系国库支绌这一荒谬言论，提出质问：“若说国库支绌不能负担，那政府几个月来在内战上政府支出的经费，是那里来的？抗战胜利时将一年，是否还要留笔大款项以从事内战准备？”又称：“今天我们再不能捆紧肚子来支持政府的对内作战！”宣言呼吁全国公教人员，全国同胞，共同起来，为促成长期停战而努力！
