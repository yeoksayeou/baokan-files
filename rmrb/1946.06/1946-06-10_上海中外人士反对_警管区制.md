Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. The Kuomintang fascists are insisting on the "police precinct system," and Chinese and foreign personages in Shanghai are constantly criticizing it. The North China Daily News editorial on the 11th of last month stated, "The trampling of people's freedom by law has never reached such a degree," and said that Japan was inferior in comparison. The United Evening News' editorial on the 10th stated: A similar method was implemented during the Yuan Dynasty's rule of China, and it ultimately led to its overthrow. Subsequently, another editorial entitled "Why Be So Hostile to the People?" was published, denouncing the Kuomintang authorities' deprivation of people's freedom of residence. On the 13th, the Times Daily published an article by a reader titled "It's Not Too Late to Pull Back from the Brink," which stated: The people have been aroused to anger, "Once it erupts, I'm afraid the paper-mache edifice of despotism will not withstand the burning." The American magazine Millard's Review pointed out: Robberies frequently occur in Shanghai, and the municipal government attributes it to a lack of funds; however, it uses huge sums of money to hire police to control the people. Shanghai celebrities also vehemently opposed it. Mr. Ma Xulun wrote an article in the Wenhui Daily on the 10th, stating: The reason why the authorities are implementing this system is that Shanghai is a mixed Chinese and foreign area, which hinders international attention and makes it inconvenient to adopt the means of the Nantong tragedy, so this "brilliant plan" is used to control democratic elements; and pointed out that under the surging democratic tide of the world, this is like a mantis trying to stop a chariot, and the result is digging one's own grave. Mr. Wang Zhongliang, a Kuomintang member of the Shanghai Municipal Council, advocated "action against action, resolutely refusing police visits." The United Evening News on May 11th carried a statement by Mr. Qian Yushi Cheng, a former figure in the financial community: "Police visiting the people is better described as harassing the people," and advocated unanimously refusing "visits," and if it meant going to jail, all the people should go to jail. The newspaper also reported that another financial magnate, Mr. Qin Runqing, said: "Impeding the people's freedom of residence is an undemocratic phenomenon." The newspaper also reported on May 16th on the opposition of people from all walks of life. Workers in the alleyways said: "It will be easier to be a robber in the future. Make a set of uniforms, knock on doors in the middle of the night, and don't be afraid that people won't open the door." Students said: "This is really not the behavior of a democratic country." The owner of a cigarette shop said: "Isn't the visit just to take advantage of cheap goods and get some tin foil?" Lawyers said: "This contradicts the basic principles of the people... Once implemented, I am afraid China will enter an era of terror." The author said: "This is a kind of restraint. If I am visited, can I still write what is in my heart?"

    上海中外人士反对“警管区制”
    【新华社延安七日电】国民党法西斯派坚持“警管区制”，上海中外人士不断抨击。字林西报上月十一日社论称：“历来法律之摧残人民自由实无达于斯者”，并谓日本比之犹为逊色。联合晚报十日社评称：在元人统治中国之时，曾以类似方法实行，终以此而遭颠复。次以又发表“何能嫉民如仇”之社论，痛斥国民党当局之剥夺人民居住自由。十三日时代日报发表一读者以《悬崖勒马尚未晚》为题一文，中称：人民已激起怒火，“一旦爆发，恐怕纸糊的专制大厦，经不起燃烧吧”。美文密勒氏报指出：沪市常出抢案，市政府委之于无钱之故；却用巨款雇用警察，管制人民。上海名流亦猛烈反对，马叙论氏于十日在文汇报上著文称：当局实行此种制度之原因，在于上海中外杂处、有碍国际耳目，不便采用南通惨案之手段，而用这一“妙计”来管制民主分子；并指出在世界澎湃的民主潮流下，这等于螳臂当车，结果是自拙坟墓。沪市参议员国民党员王仲良氏，则主张“以行动对行动，可断然拒绝警察访问”。联合晚报五月十一日载金融界前辇俞实澄氏说：“警察访问民间，不如说骚扰民间”，并主张一致拒绝“访问”，要坐牢全体老百姓都去坐牢。该报又载另一金融界巨子秦润卿氏说：“妨害老百姓居住自由，这是不民主的现象”。该报五月十六日并报导各阶层人民的反对，弄堂工人讲：“以后做强盗倒顺当了，做起一套制服，半夜三更去敲门，不怕人家不开门”。学生说：“这真不是民主国家的行为。”纸烟店老板说：“访问还不是借此贪点便宜货，捞点锡箔去”。律师说：“这与人民基本自相抵触………一日实施后，恐怕中国就要进入恐怖时代”。作者说：“这是一种束缚，访向，结果找还能痛快地写出我内心的话吗？”
