    Farmer Emancipation Team Directly Under Military
    Intensifies Study to Prepare for Going to the Countryside
    [This Newspaper Reports] In order to truly and fully mobilize the masses, the units directly under the military and the Luohe Detachment have all selected cadres and soldiers to organize farmer emancipation teams. They began to concentrate on studying together on May 28th. The study method is: listening to reports, reading documents, discussing (reflecting on oneself in connection with reality), and raising questions (for the next speaker's reference). Commander Liu, Political Commissar Deng, and Deputy Political Commissar Bo successively gave reports on the work of mass emancipation, which enhanced everyone's enthusiasm for learning and their passion for this work. For example, some comrades initially felt that farmer emancipation had little to do with them, but now they realize that the people's army's heroic struggle, bloodshed, and sacrifice are precisely for the people's emancipation, and that the emancipation movement is closely linked to every revolutionary soldier. Some who were initially uneasy about studying have gradually settled down and are determined to throw themselves into the great furnace of this great action with the highest enthusiasm to temper themselves. Some who believe they have no experience in mass work and therefore lack confidence are also in the process of transforming. (Cun Tian)

    军直农民翻身队
    加紧学习准备下乡
    【本报讯】为了真正使群众充分发动起来，军直各单位及洛河支队，均抽出干部和战士，组织农民翻身队，于五月二十八日，开始全部集中在一块学习，学习方法是：听报告、看文件、讨论（联系自己反省），提问题（作下次报告人参考），先后由刘师长、邓政委、薄副政委作了群众翻身工作报告，提高了大家学习情绪和对这一工作的热情。如：开始有些同志过去觉得农民翻身与自己没多大关系，现在认识到人民的军队，英勇奋斗，流血牺牲正是为了人民翻身，翻身运动与每个革命战士是密切联系着的。有的开始不安心学习，现已逐渐安心下来，并决心以最高的热诚，投入这伟大行动的洪炉中去锻炼自己，有些认为自己没有群运工作经验，因而信心不高者，亦正在转变中。（村田）
