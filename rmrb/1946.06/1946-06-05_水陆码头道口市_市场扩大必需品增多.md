    Water and Land Transportation Hub, Daokou City
    Market Expansion and Increased Availability of Essential Goods
    [Report from our Heze correspondent] Daokou City is a water and land transportation hub located east of the Wei River and on the Daokou-Qinghua Railway. The city's population totals over 9,800, of whom 70% are merchants. Since the establishment of the democratic government in September last year, all commercial sectors have increased by at least five times and at most fourteen times compared to the enemy-occupied period. The transportation of firewood and grain, as well as petty commerce, has also gradually increased. The number of established merchants from Hebei and Shanxi has increased from 168 to 592. There are now 18 grain stores, 57 restaurants, 125 cigarette workshops, and 13 bicycle shops. On Shunhe Avenue, which is three li long, there are more than 1,100 stores of various sizes. Thanks to government loan assistance, the number of small stall vendors has also increased from 172 to 967. In terms of trade, the market used to primarily consist of luxury goods used by a small number of people, unsuitable for the needs of rural masses. Now, after the democratic government liberated Daokou, the market for essential goods for the masses has gradually expanded. Small industries such as copper and iron factories, and sock workshops, have also increased from more than ten to 242. Due to the prosperity of industry and commerce, 90% of the workers, shop assistants, and porters, who were previously unemployed, have all regained employment.
