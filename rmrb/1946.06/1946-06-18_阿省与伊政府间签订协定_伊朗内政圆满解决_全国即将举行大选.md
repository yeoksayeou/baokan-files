Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: Tehran dispatch: Prince Firouz, head of the Iranian government delegation, announced on the 14th on the Tabriz Radio that an agreement had been signed three days ago between the Democratic Government of Azerbaijan Province and the Central Government of Iran. This matter has made Azerbaijan no longer an "international issue." Prince Firouz signed on behalf of the Iranian government, and Prime Minister Pishvari signed on behalf of the Azerbaijan Democratic Government. The main points of the agreement are that Azerbaijan withdraws its demand for autonomy and gives up forming its own cabinet ministries and prime minister. At the same time, the Iranian government should accept the list nominated by the Azerbaijan Provincial Council and appoint the governor of Azerbaijan Province. The Azerbaijan National Army will not be disbanded but will be under the command of the Iranian Army. Seventy-five percent of Azerbaijan's tax revenue should go to the province's treasury, and the rest to the national treasury. The Kurds, Armenians, and Assyrians enjoy the same rights as the Azerbaijanis. Kurdish primary schools can teach in Kurdish. The issue of women's suffrage has been submitted to the Tehran Parliament for discussion.

It is expected that after Prime Minister Sultani obtains cabinet approval of this agreement, the Iranian King will issue an order to hold national elections within days. At the same time, Prime Minister Sultani will also begin to implement his announced plan for internal reforms. The Iranian government delegation headed by Prince Firouz is scheduled to return to Tehran today (the 15th).

Sinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: Tehran dispatch: Azerbaijan Prime Minister Pishvari also announced on the 14th on the Great Tabriz Radio that the agreement between Azerbaijan and the Central Government of Iran had been signed. He told the people of Azerbaijan: "Our responsibility is now even greater. In the past, we worked for Azerbaijan, but now we must strive for the welfare of the entire Iran."

The agreement has been approved by the Presidium of the Azerbaijan National Assembly. On the morning of the 14th, the Presidium met again to accept the resignation of Prime Minister Pishvari, but asked him to continue in power until the leading body of the Provincial Assembly is elected. According to the agreement, the National Assembly will be replaced by the Provincial Assembly.

    【新华社延安十五日电】德黑兰讯：伊政府代表团团长佛鲁兹亲王，十四日在大不里士电台公告：阿塞拜疆省民主政府与伊中央政府间已于前三日签订协定。此事已使阿塞拜疆不再成为“国际问题”。代表伊政府签字的为佛鲁兹亲王，代表阿塞拜疆民主政府签字的为彼希瓦利总理。协定的主要点，为阿塞拜疆撤回其自治的要求，放弃自组内阁各部及总理。同时伊政府应接受阿省委议会的推选名单，任命阿省省长，阿省国民军不解散，但将受伊陆军之统辖。阿省税收，百分之七十五应归该省省库，其余则归国库。库特尔人，阿美尼亚人及阿西利安族人与阿塞拜疆人享有同等的权利。库特尔初级学校，可授库特尔语。妇女选举问题，已提交德黑兰议会讨论。
    预计伊总理苏尔丹尼，在获得内阁批准此协定后，伊王将发布命令，于日内举行大选。同时苏尔丹尼总理亦将着手实行其所宣布的内政改革计划。以佛鲁兹亲王为首的伊政府代表团，定今日（十五日）返德黑兰。
    【斯华社延安十五日电】德黑兰讯：阿塞拜疆总理彼希瓦利，十四日亦在大德里士电台宣布，阿塞拜疆与伊中央政府之协定业已签字。他告诉阿塞拜疆人民说：“我们的责任现在更加重大了，过去我们为阿塞拜疆而工作，现在我们是要为整个伊朗的福利而努力了。”
    协定已由阿省国民议会主席团批准。十四日晨，主席团又集会接受总理彼希瓦利的辞呈，但请他继续秉政，直至省议会的领导机关选出为止。根据所定协定，国民议会将以省议会代替。
