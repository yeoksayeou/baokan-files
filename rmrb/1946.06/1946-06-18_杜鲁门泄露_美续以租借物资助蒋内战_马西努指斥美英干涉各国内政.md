    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th. Associated Press, Washington: US President Truman, in his "Twenty-Second Report on the Implementation of the Lend-Lease Act" on the 14th, revealed that the United States had spent $300 million on airlifting Chinese troops to various parts of China. The report stated that the United States had ceased Lend-Lease to all countries, but continued to aid Chinese troops (actually, only the Kuomintang's troops). In addition to airlifting Chinese troops, Truman also mentioned that the US Army Far East Supply Officer had loaned China vehicles worth $68 million and ammunition worth $500,000. The report stated: All of this, as well as the aid given to China after Victory Day, is equal to twice the amount of Lend-Lease materials before Victory Day, totaling $1,335,632,000 from December 31, 1945, to date. Truman further stated: US military aid to China "continued throughout the period covered by this report." The amount of Lend-Lease materials given to China was listed as fifth in the world. He said: From April 1, 1941, to February 20, 1945, the total value of Lend-Lease materials to countries around the world was $49.096 billion.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th. The United States continues to gift warships to Chiang. The Kuomintang Central Naval Training Corps in Qingdao continued to receive the second batch of eight US Navy amphibious ships on the 12th. The first batch of eight ships was received on the 29th of last month. According to the Central News Agency, approximately 200 US landing ships are being transferred to the Kuomintang, and it is expected that the transfer will be completed within a month. According to a special dispatch from the Central News Agency in New York on the 12th, the former US Navy ships transferred to the Kuomintang authorities include two escort destroyers, four minesweepers, and two patrol ships. Eighty Kuomintang naval officers and 1,000 soldiers trained in the United States are on their way back from the United States. It is claimed that there are still 270 US ships to be transferred to the Kuomintang army next year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th. Moscow radio commentator Masinu commented today on British and American interference in the internal affairs of various countries. Masinu stated: After the war, the reactionary forces in these countries have strengthened, and imperialist attempts have developed again, attempting to politically and economically oppress and exploit the liberated European countries. They do not allow these countries to establish their own lives. Because doing so would block the path of imperialists and war instigators. Therefore, under the guise of "help," they actively interfere in the internal affairs of these countries. However, the so-called "help" contains a completely different meaning. It is not to help these countries achieve sovereignty, independence, and national unity, but to help the reactionaries oppress the people and establish their own rule. In Greece, Britain has helped reactionary forces suppress democratic forces, turning Greece into a sphere of influence of the British Empire. The help that Britain has implemented in Iran is to enable the British Ambassador to Iran to interfere in Iran's internal affairs. He threatened the Iranian Prime Minister, telling him to adopt methods that violate the will of the people when electing the parliament. In the Far East, this interference is carried out in the name of helping to disarm the Japanese army and repatriate the Japanese army. The result of this kind of help in Indonesia is that the British and Dutch troops used the Japanese army to attack the East Indian People's Army and restore Dutch imperialist rule. In China, "helping" to disarm the Japanese army and repatriate the Japanese army means that the United States is helping the Kuomintang to use the Japanese army to expand the Chinese civil war and oppose the Chinese People's Revolutionary Army and all democratic forces.

    杜鲁门泄露
    美续以租借物资助蒋内战
    马西努指斥美英干涉各国内政
    【新华社延安十五日电】美联社华盛顿讯：美总统杜鲁门于十四日在“关于执行租借法案的二十二次报告”中泄露，由于空运华军分赴中国各处，美国已用去三万万美元。该报告说明美国对各国都已停止租借，但仍继续援助中国军队（按实际上只是国民党的军队）。除了空运华军之外，杜鲁门又提及已由美军远东供应员借给中国价值六千八百万美元的车辆，及价值五十万美元的军火。该报告称：所有这些以及胜利日以后给予中国的援助，等于胜利日以前中国租借物资数量的两倍，由一九四五年十二月三十一日迄今，总值一、三三五、六三二、○○○美元。杜鲁门复称：美国给中国的军事援助，“在此报告所包括之时期内，始终继续进行”。给中国的租借物资数目，列为世界第五位。他说：由一九四一年四月一日至一九四五年二月二十日止，世界各国租借物资的总值，为四百九十万万零九千六百万美元。
    【新华社延安十五日电】美国继续以军舰赠蒋。青岛国民党中央海军训练团，十二日继续接收第二批美海军两栖舰艇八艘。第一批八艘，系于上月二十九日接收者。据中央社称：此等移交国民党之美登陆舰艇，约共二百艘，预计一月以内可接收竣事。另据中央社纽约十二日专电报导：移交国民党当局之前美海军舰只，包括护航驱送舰两艘，扫雷舰四艘，巡逻舰两艘。在美训练之国民党海军军官八十人，兵士一千人，已在自美返国途中，据称：尚有美舰二百七十艘，将于明年移交国民党军。
    【新华社延安十五日电】莫斯科今日广播评论员马西努评英美干涉各国内政。马西努称：战后这些国家的反动势力加强了，帝国主义的企图又形发展，企图在政治上，经济上压迫剥削被解放出来的欧洲国家。他们不容许这些国家内建立自己的生活。因为这样一来，即会阻止帝国主义及战争挑拨者的道路。因此他们用“帮助”的名义，积极干涉这些国家的内政，但所谓“帮助”完全包含另一种内容，不是帮助这些国家争取主权独立与民族团结统一，而是帮助反动派压迫人民建立自己的统治。英国在希腊曾帮助反动势力压迫民主力量，把希腊变成英帝国的势力范围。英国在伊朗所实行的帮助，是使英驻伊大使干涉伊朗内政。他威胁伊总理，叫他在选举国会时，采取违反人民意志的办法。在远东，这种干涉是以帮助解除日军武装与遣送日军回国的名义。他们进行的这种帮助，在印度尼西亚实行的结果，是英荷军队利用日军进攻东印度人民军，恢复荷兰帝国主义统治。在中国“帮助”解除日军武装及遣送日军回国，即是美国帮助国民党利用日军扩大中国内战，反对中国人民革命军及一切民主力量。
