    Has Day Broken?
    Shanghai Correspondence

    Man-Eating Prices
    The people of Shanghai are living through troubled times.
    Although relief flour is continuously being unloaded from American ships on the Bund, the Shanghai people who sell their labor are not fortunate enough to enjoy it. The subsidized flour, sugar, and oils are designated for specific locations and times for distribution, but many people who go to the designated addresses at the designated times often return dejectedly because the distribution period is very short, the prices are only 10% lower than the market price, and they require a minimum purchase of twenty bags of flour. Those who cannot afford twenty bags and cannot squeeze to the front can only lament their ill fate for not getting a share of the "relief."
    Prices in the market are soaring, and the cost of food for laborers has risen sharply. Take fried dough sticks and pancakes as an example: on February 10th, they were sold for 10 yuan each in legal tender, but by the 15th, they were sold for 15 yuan; and on the 20th, they became 20 yuan. Thus, a rickshaw puller has to spend at least 60,000 to 70,000 yuan in puppet currency every day to eat his fill.
    Due to the speculation of hoarders, prices in Shanghai are truly soaring "a thousand miles a day." On the day Chairman Chiang arrived in Shanghai, prices briefly fell, but the next day they jumped back to their original levels; on the third day, they soared even more fiercely. The reporter recorded the general prices in Shanghai (on February 25th) as follows:
    Rice: 34,000 yuan per dan (equivalent to 6.4 million yuan in puppet currency, a staggering increase of 80% compared to last week).
    Coal: 4,500 yuan per dan.
    Butter: 57,000 yuan per dan.
    Quilt cover: 140,000 yuan...
    However, the nightclubs and dozens of large dance halls in Shanghai are always packed with all kinds of cars and jeeps, displaying signs saying "Please come early tomorrow," indicating they are fully booked. "Exquisite" films like "Serpent Beauty" and "Flowers Blooming Together" even have a black market. A large food company on Nanjing Road has a colorful advertisement for "Silver Thread Noodles," priced at 80,000 yuan per tail in legal tender, equivalent to 10 million yuan in puppet currency, yet the place is bustling. A foreign firm on the Bund advertises "imported modern handkerchiefs," priced at 320,000 yuan per square in legal tender. It is said that the handkerchief business of the foreign firm is extremely "lively," showing that the wealthy gentlemen of Shanghai still have enough leisure to patronize "Silver Thread Noodle shops" and "imported handkerchiefs," while one handkerchief is enough for a poor boy's food for several years.
        Garret Rooms
    The housing shortage in Shanghai is probably the most serious among major cities.
    If you want to rent a house, then please first take out the "key money" and "deposit." The general "key money" ranges from two or three gold bars to ten gold bars (each bar weighing ten taels). If you want to stay in a hotel, a good one costs 20,000 yuan a day; a medium one costs 2,000 to 3,000 yuan; and even the worst one costs more than 1,000 yuan a day; and you have to book in advance.
    The constant increase in rent is simply staggering. A friend of the reporter rents a garret room on the second floor of 7 Hongfu Lane, North Henan Road. He used to pay 900 yuan in puppet currency per month, but now it has increased to 540,000 yuan in puppet currency, yet he can do nothing about it. In addition, many bizarre things have also happened. For example, a sub-landlord named Zhao Wenqiu at 97 Middle Zheng Road rented a house to twenty-one tenants. Recently, he suddenly had a whim and obtained a "business license" from the police station. He then charged each room 1,000 yuan per day according to the hotel charging method, causing the tenants to complain endlessly.
    People who come to Shanghai for the first time are surprised and ask, why is the housing shortage in Shanghai so serious? Is it due to the increase in population? Is it due to war damage? No. According to reports, during the enemy and puppet rule, Shanghai's population was still five million, but now, even with the addition of people from Chongqing, it is only more than three million. Moreover, from Zhabei to the Bund, you cannot see any traces of war damage. The main reason, according to people familiar with the inside story, is that there are thousands of "enemy and puppet properties" in Shanghai, which have been tightly sealed. A considerable number of foreign houses have been transferred to "treat" Japanese prisoners of war. Furthermore, the "new rich" and "new new rich" snatch up a batch of houses every day. It is said that an important official with the rank of major general occupies five mansions alone. Thus, the common people can only "sigh at the buildings" and crowd into garret rooms.
        Outside the Survival Line
    A month ago, the strikes and slowdowns of 170,000 workers in Shanghai ignited, followed by large-scale petitions by primary school teachers. Recently, it was heard that even university professors have organized a federation to ensure their livelihood.
    "Headhunting shops" (i.e., shops that introduce maids) are appearing everywhere. The price of a maid is satisfied only if she is "fed," but still no one patronizes them.
    Rickshaw pullers are also starting to worry because compassionate "adults" cannot bear to see their health declining in the "inhumane" running, leading to death. Therefore, in January, they issued an order to "ban rickshaws completely within three years" and decided to reduce the number of rickshaws in stages to achieve the goal of complete banishment. A rickshaw puller complained to the reporter: "If you don't let me pull a rickshaw, where can I find a way to make a living?" It is said that the rickshaw pullers jointly wrote a petition to the authorities, requesting that the order be revoked, or at least the time limit of three years be changed to ten years, but it was ignored.
    Many people who are driven to a dead end by life take risks. The number of theft cases in Shanghai today is truly unprecedented in history. According to publicly published reports, there were 60 theft cases in October of last year, 160 in December, and more than 200 in January of this year.
    Even on busy streets such as Nanjing Road, there are "daylight robberies"; even the dignified residence of General Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin suffered a major theft. Not long ago, a bandit was caught, who turned out to be a "dramatist." The reporter has a copy of the Lipo newspaper dated January 19th, which stated that the Songhu Garrison Command executed five robbers; two of them were teachers; one was a student; and another was a printing worker.
        Who Are They?
    What annoys the people of Shanghai the most is the lack of human rights protection and freedom. Workers do not have the freedom to strike, teachers do not have the freedom to speak, students do not have the freedom to study (missing fifteen characters)... Everywhere you encounter unfamiliar faces monitoring you, and sometimes you even receive inexplicable threatening letters.
    For example, when the workers of the British-owned power company slowed down their work, the authorities wanted to use delaying tactics to break the workers' unity, but they failed. On January 31st, four trucks suddenly came, carrying so-called "scouts" and two hundred thugs, who rushed into the factory and beat anyone they saw, resulting in dozens of people being injured, including five seriously injured and one killed. The thugs also arrested nineteen worker representatives and sent them to the court, accusing the workers of "obstructing freedom." Where did these thugs and the "scouts," whose husbands are unknown, come from? Who are they?
    During the same period, students from ninety-eight schools in Shanghai organized a student aid federation to carry out fundraising publicity. However, the principal of Jiancheng Middle School, who lent the venue to the federation, received several phone calls that day, ordering the student aid federation to move out, otherwise "you have a background, be careful!" The broadcasting station contacted by the federation was also taught a clever method by certain figures, and the broadcast was suddenly cut off in the middle. Where did these figures come from? Who are they?
    A few days later, two students from Southeast Medical College were walking out of the school gate after attending a meeting at Jiancheng Middle School. Two plainclothes men stopped them and asked what kind of meeting they were holding, who was the chairman, and who was in charge. Also during this period, two female students from Fifth Girls' Middle School were discussing the student aid movement while walking when a "friend" in a suit and a felt hat pulled down to his eyebrows suddenly rushed up from behind and questioned them where they came from, where they were going, and what they were doing, scaring them into running away. Where did these uninvited guests come from? Who are they?
    The reactionaries used some students to hold anti-Soviet demonstrations. Students from Dongwu University and more than fifty other schools refused to participate and completely rejected the demonstration proposal at the meeting called by the reactionaries. After the meeting, these students who insisted on justice were threatened by people from unknown sources, and even forced to admit that they were "being used." Where did these figures come from? Who are they?
    The students of Shanghai answered this question. They – the "Shanghai Student Patriotic Federation" issued an angry accusation and call: "Demand the abolition of secret service agencies," "Demand the realization of Chairman Chiang's four promises, demand true democracy and freedom."
  People's Control
    These days, the clearing of household registrations is being actively carried out under the full mobilization of more than 30,000 "retained" puppet Bao-Jia heads. The family next door to the reporter, consisting of more than twenty people, was busy all day yesterday trying to fill in the dates of birth on the household registration form. The three old women, because they were not allowed to fill in "so-and-so's wife," had to have a name and surname, so they temporarily took a "school name." This morning, the old housewife ran to my room and chattered endlessly:
    "Oh, sir, let me talk sense, why do we need to run the Bao-Jia again? The Japanese oppressed us common people until we couldn't breathe. What good is it?" Her eldest son, who works as a driver at the power company, also said angrily: "Bao-Jia, Bao-Jia, if someone else commits a crime, we have to be jointly responsible. Is there any reason for that? What kind of law is this? We are so busy working at the factory, where do we have time to do voluntary 'special work'?" The reporter has heard such complaints more than once. On December 19th, after the municipal government announced the list of the chiefs and deputy chiefs of the twenty-nine districts, the landlord Mr. Guangdong took the Dagong Daily to show me. What he was most dissatisfied with was that almost all of the fifty-seven district officials were party officials who had fled from the rear. The composition of the list of the twenty-nine districts is as follows:
    Party members: 17
    Bureaucratic background: 8
    Military secret agents: 7
    Bank concurrently: 3
    School shop owners: 2
    Other speculative businesses: 3
    Newspaper and lawyer: 3 each
    Unknown occupation: 15
    What the people of Shanghai are dissatisfied with the Bao-Jia is that today they still retain the three thousand puppet Bao chiefs and thirty thousand puppet Jia chiefs. During the eight years, they colluded with the enemy and the Japanese military, oppressing and exploiting the common people. Their crimes are too numerous to count. Today, they still stand openly on top of the people's heads. The common people still dare not say "no" to them, watching them enter what "Bao-Jia chief training classes" in batches, holding the "book of life and death" and swaggering in and out of the alley gates.
    Recently, there have also been incidents of citizens refusing to fill out national identity cards. They refuse to put fingerprints and refuse to fill in photos. Their reason is: "Not to be fascist citizens." It is said that the officialdom is still insisting on this matter, but the Shanghai citizens who truly yearn for freedom will also insist on opposing this ugly system of controlling the people. A few days ago, the reporter attended a rally in Shanghai attended by more than forty groups to welcome Mr. Shen Junru. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution requesting the government to abolish the Bao-Jia system. When the presidium announced this resolution, the warm applause lasted for several minutes. This is the voice of the people. Is our government, which is "diligent in seeking the people's secrets," willing to listen to this magnificent voice?

    天亮了吗？

    吃人的物价
    上海人在过着烦恼的日子。
    虽然救济面粉源源不断的从外滩美国的轮船上卸下来，但是出卖劳动力的上海人，却是没有福分享受的。平价的面粉、白糖，油类都被规定了发售的地点和时间，可是不少按址按时前去的人，常常是垂头丧气的回来，因为发售的时间很短，价格只低于市价百分之十，而且还要二十包面粉才起售，那些买不起二十包的和没法挤上前去的人们，那只有自叹命薄落不到“救济”的份了。
    市场上百物腾贵，苦力们的饭食价格飞跃的上升，单说油条大饼，二月十日还卖法币十元一件，到了十五号，就卖十五元；廿号就成了二十元。这样一个车夫每天至少要吃伪币六七万元，才能吃饱。
    因为投机家的操纵物资，上海的物价，真是“一日千里”地飞腾了。蒋主席到上海的那天，物价曾经跌了一下，可是第二天就跳回原位；第三天就飞的更凶，记者摘录（二月二十五日）上海的一般物价如下：
    米一担三万四千元（合伪币六百四十万元，较上周狂涨百分之八十）。
    煤一担，四千五百元。
    牛油一担，五万七千元。
    被面一条，十四万元。……
    但是上海的夜总会以及数十家大舞厅门口，却经常停满了各式的汽车、吉普车，高挂着“请君明日早临”的客满牌，“香美绝伦”的影片，“蛇蝎美人”和“花开并蒂莲”等居然有黑市。南京路某大食品公司“银丝大上市”的彩色广告，其售价每尾法币八万元，合伪币一千万元。却是门庭若市。外滩某洋行出售“舶来品摩登手帕”的广告，标价每方价格为法币三十二万元，据说该洋行手帕生意殊为“闹忙”，足见上海的豪富大人们仍有足够的余暇去光顾“银丝店”与“来手帕”的兴趣；而手帕一方已足够穷小子数年的粮食了。
        亭子间
    上海人没有房子住，恐怕是各大城市中最为严重的了。
    如果你要租一所房屋，那末就请先拿出“顶费”和“押金”来，一般的“顶费”，从两三根金条到十根金条不等（一条重十两），如果你要住旅馆，好的二万元一天；中等的两三千元；最蹩脚的也要千余元一天；而且还得预先讲定才行。
    租额的不断提高，简直令人咋舌。记者有一位熟友，租住北河南路洪福里七号二层楼的一间亭子间，以前每月付房租伪币九百元，今竟加到伪币五十四万元，然亦无可奈何。此外异想天开的事情也发生不少。例如在中正中路九七号有一个二房东叫赵文秋的，他把一幢房屋出租给二十一个房客，最近忽然心血来潮，去警察局领了一张“营业执照”，按照旅馆收费的办法，规定每个房间每日收费一千元，房客莫不叫苦连天。
    初到上海的人，都惊讶的发问，上海的房荒为何严重到这样？人口增加的缘故吗？战争毁坏的原因吗？不是的。据报载：敌伪统治时，上海人口还有五百万，如今加上重庆客也不过三百多万，而且从闸北到外滩，你看不到什么战争毁伤的痕迹来，主要的原因，据熟知内幕的人说：上海有上千房的“敌伪产业”，一直被封条紧紧的关住。数目不少的洋房，又移去“优待”了日俘。再就是那些“新贵”和“新新贵”们每日都要抢上一批房子，据说一位官居少将的要员，一个人就占了五座公馆。于是乎小民们只好“望楼兴叹”，拥挤到亭子间去了。
        生存线外
    一个月以前，上海十七万工人的罢工怠工燃烧起来，接着小学教师也进行大请愿，最近听说连大学教授也为了保障生活而组织了联合会。
    理头店（按：介雇女佣的店铺）在各处出现着，一个佣妇的代价，只要“吃饱肚子”就满足。可是依然没有人惠顾。
    车夫们也发起愁来了，因为有慈悲为怀的“大人”们为了看不过他们的健康在“不合人道”的奔跑中趋于衰老，以至死亡，故在一月间订出了“限三年内禁绝人力车”的通令，并决定分期减少人力车的数量，以达到全部禁绝的目的。一个黄包车夫向记者诉苦说：“不要我拉车，叫我到那里找活命的方法呢？”据说车夫们联合给当局写了一封请命书，要求收回成命，至少也要限期三年改为十年，但是没有得到理睬。
    被生活逼得走头无路的人们，很多就挺而走险，上海今天盗案之多，真是历史上所未见。据报上所公开刊载的。去年十月有盗案六十件，十二月就多到一百六十件，今年一月增加到二百多件。
    热闹的马路如南京，也有“白昼行劫”的事情；堂堂的陆军总司令何应钦公馆，也发生了巨窃案，不久以前捉到了一个盗匪，原来是一个“戏剧家”。记者手头有一份一月十九日的立报内称：淞沪警备司令部枪决了五个强盗；内有两个是教员；一个是学生；还有一个是印刷工人。
        他们是谁
    最使得上海人烦恼的要算没有人权保障的自由了，工人没有罢工的自由，教师没有讲话的自由，学生没有求学的自由（漏十五字）到处碰到不相识的脸孔监视者，有人有时还接到莫明其妙的恐吓信。
    比方说，英商电力公司的工友怠工，当局想用拖延的战术打垮工友们的团结，但是失败了，一月三十一日忽然来了四辆卡车，载来了所谓“索夫团”和二百个暴徒，冲进厂内，逢人便打，结果数十人被打伤，内中五名重伤，一人毙命。暴徒还捉了十九名工人代表，送到法院，反而控诉工人“妨碍自由”。这些打手和不知谁是她们的丈夫的“索夫团”究竟从那里来的呢？他们又是谁呢？
    在同一时期里，上海九十八个学校的学生组织了助学联合会，进行募捐宣传，但是借给该会会址的建承中学校长，当天就接到好几次电话，要勒令助学联合会搬家，否则“你们是有背景的，当心些！”联合会接洽的广播电台，也蒙受了某方人物传授妙法，广播到中途，突然截断电流，使之中断。这些人物是从那里来的呢？他们又是谁呢？
    几天后的一个晚上，东南医学院有两位同学，从建承开完会出来，在校门口有两个穿便衣的人拦住问他们在开什么会，谁是主席，谁是负责人，也在这时期内有五女中的两位女生在走路时讨论助学运动的事情，突然后面赶上来一个四十多岁呢帽复在眉毛上的西装“朋友”，突然其来的向她们质问从那里来的，到那儿去，干些什么等等，吓得她们拔步就跑，这些不速之客，他们究竟从那里来的呢？他们又是谁呢？
    反动派利用了部分学生，举行了反苏游行，东吴大学等五十多校学生拒绝参加，并且在反动分子召集的会议上，全部否决了游行提议，会后这些坚持正义的学生，纷纷受到来路不明的人的威胁，甚至要他们承认“受人利用”，这些人物究竟从那里来的？他们又是谁呢？
    上海的学生回答了这个问题，他们——“上海学生爱国联合会”发出了愤怒的控诉和呼喊：“要求实现取消特务机关”、“要求实现蒋主席的四项诺言、要求真正的民主和自由”。
  人的管制
    这几天清查户口在三万多个“留交”的伪保甲长的全体动员下积极的展开了。记者隔壁的一家，住着大小二十余口，昨天为了要填明户籍表上的生辰年月日。全家忙了一天，三个老太婆，因为不准填某某氏，硬要有名有姓，部临时取一个“学名”。今天早晨那位老主妇絮絮不休的跑到我的房间里扯话：
    “落，先生侬来讲讲道理，又要办啥保甲，日本人把吾伲老百姓压得气都透勿转来，有啥格好处末。”他的一个在电力公司当司机的大儿子，也愤愤的说：“保甲保甲，别人家犯了罪，倒要吾伲来连保连坐，阿有道理根据，啥格皇法，吾伲在厂里工作忙来交关，那有闲工夫来干义务格‘特工’。”记者听到这样的怨言不只一次了，在十二月十九日，市政府发表了二十九个区的正副区长的名单之后，房东光东先生拿了大公报来看我，他最不满意的是五十七个区官里面，几乎全是从后方跑来的党官老爷，这二十九个区的名单的成份是这样的：
    党部人员十七人，官僚出身八人，军队特工七人银行兼任三人，学店老板二人，其他投机买卖三人，报馆律师各三人，不明职业的十五人。
    上海人不满意保甲的地方，还在于今天居然还留用的三千个伪保长和三万个伪甲长，他们在八年中勾结敌宪，欺压盘剥老百姓，真是罄竹难书，今天还是公然站在人民头上，老百姓还不敢对他们说个“不”字，眼看着他们一批批进什么“保甲长讲习会”，拿着“生死簿”大模大样的在巷门里进出。
    最近还发生市民拒填国民身份证的事情，他们不肯打手印，不愿填照片，他们的理由是：“不做法西斯国民”据说这件事情官厅还在坚持之中，但是真正的渴望着自由的上海市民也会坚持反对这管制人民的丑恶的制度的，前几天记者参加了一次上海四十余团体欢迎沈君儒老先生的大会，大会中一致通过要求政府废除保甲制，当主席团宣读这一个决议案时，热烈的掌声历数分钟不绝，这是人民的声音，我们的“勤求民隐”的政府，是否愿意听听这雄伟的声音呢？
