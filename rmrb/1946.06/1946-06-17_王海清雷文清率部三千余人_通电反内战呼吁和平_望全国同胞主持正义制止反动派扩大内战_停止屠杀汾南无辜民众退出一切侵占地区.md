    [This Newspaper Yangcheng, 13th Dispatch] (Late Dispatch) Wang Haiqing and Lei Wenqing of the Yan Xishan army’s local special task force in southern Shanxi, leading more than 3,000 troops, refused to execute the Kuomintang's order to attack the Shanxi-South Liberation Area and ignite a civil war. On June 2nd, Wang, Lei, and others issued a telegram opposing the civil war and calling for immediate peace. The original text is as follows:

    To Chairman Chiang in Nanjing, Chairman Mao in Yan'an, all newspaper offices across the country, people from all walks of life, and all compatriots nationwide: Since the ceasefire, Qing [meaning Wang Haiqing] et al. have repeatedly received instructions from Yan, the commander of the Second War Zone, and Xie Kejian, the commissioner of southern Shanxi, ordering the resolute elimination of the CCP's stationed troops in various counties of southern Shanxi. Qing et al., believing that peace had been achieved, could not bear to see the recurrence of civil war, which would cause the people of southern Shanxi to suffer once again. Therefore, they repeatedly refused by claiming concentration for reorganization and training. Until May 15th, the 39th and 72nd Divisions of the Second War Zone, and the 167th and 31st Divisions of Hu Zongnan's forces, totaling more than 20,000 men, successively entered southern Shanxi from Yuncheng, Xinjiang, Shaanxi and other places, and ordered Qing et al. to supervise and lead their troops to cooperate in "suppressing the communists." Qing et al. still prioritized peace and unity and refused to execute the order for civil war. Unexpectedly, this brought punishment from the authorities, and more than 20,000 troops engaged in "communist suppression" simultaneously launched an encirclement and suppression campaign against Qing et al., determined to force Qing et al. to accept their "communist suppression" order, which was intended to provoke civil war and mutual slaughter, or to exterminate Qing et al. altogether! Recalling the beginning of the War of Resistance, the National Army abandoned the people of southern Shanxi and fled one after another to surrender to the enemy. To defend their homeland, Qing et al. gathered patriots, organized armed forces to resist Japan, and persisted in fighting in the Hejin and Ronghe areas. They were successively ordered by Hu Zongnan and Yan Xishan and reorganized into the southern Shanxi local special task force. However, for several years, the authorities have continuously issued orders and instructions, not on how to strike against enemy puppets, but on how to prevent dissidents and eliminate "communist bandits." Qing et al. have repeatedly obeyed these orders with tears in their eyes, compelled by military orders. After the ceasefire order, the authorities continued to order the "suppression of communists" in a civil war. Qing et al., although mere military men, also know the great significance of peace and unity. After repeated consideration, they could no longer endure it and had to refuse this order for a civil war of mutual slaughter, which resulted in the authorities launching a large-scale encirclement and suppression campaign. The conspiracy of the reactionaries, who disregard the interests of the people and attempt to eliminate dissidents and undermine peace, is now more exposed than ever. Qing et al., deeply moved by the sincerity of the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party in saving the country through peace and democracy, and inspired by the aspirations of the people from all walks of life in southern Shanxi, uphold their original aspiration and unite with democratic forces, vowing to continue to fight for the protection of the interests of the people of southern Shanxi and the cause of peace and democracy. However, in the past half month, the Chiang-Yan troops, obsessed with civil war, have launched a large-scale offensive against the CCP troops stationed in the area while besieging Qing et al. The situation has become extremely serious. We earnestly hope that the ruling officials and all compatriots nationwide will uphold justice, immediately stop the reactionary's conspiracy to expand the civil war, cease the encirclement and suppression of Qing et al. and the CCP troops, as well as the slaughter of innocent people in southern Shanxi, and withdraw from all occupied areas to achieve peace. This telegram is hereby sent, awaiting your wise guidance. Sincerely, Wang Haiqing, Major General Inspector, Lei Wenqing, Colonel Commander, and all officers and soldiers (more than 3,000 personnel) of the Southern Shanxi Local Special Task Force. June 2nd.

    通电反内战呼吁和平
    望全国同胞主持正义制止反动派扩大内战
    停止屠杀汾南无辜民众退出一切侵占地区
    【本报阳城十三日电】（迟到）汾南阎军地方特务团王海清、雷文清率部三千余人，拒绝执行国民党进攻汾南解放区的内战命令，六月二日王雷等并发出反对内战呼吁立即实现和平通电。原文如下：
    南京蒋主席、延安毛主席、全国各报馆、各界人士及全国同胞公鉴：停战以来，清等迭奉第二战区阎长官及汾南专员谢克俭指示，命令坚决消灭汾南各县中共驻军。清等以和平方告实现，不忍见内战之再起，使汾南人民重遭蹂躏，仍以集中整训为词，屡次婉言拒绝。迄至五月十五日，二战区之三十九师、七十二师、及胡宗南之一六七师、三十一师等部二万余人，乃由运城、新绛、陕西等地先后进入汾南，并令清等督率所部配合“剿共”，清等仍以和平团结为重，拒绝执行内战命令，不料因此章招罪戾于当局，遂以两万余“剿共”大军同时向清等进行围剿，必欲迫使清等接受其挑动内战自相残杀之“剿共”命令，或将清等斩尽杀绝而后已！回忆抗战之初，国军弃晋南人民而不顾，纷纷逃遁投敌。清等为保卫家乡，乃纠合志士，组织抗日武装，坚持斗争于河津、荣河地区，先后受命于胡宗南、阎锡山，编为汾南地方特务团。惟数年以来，当局不断命令指示者，非为如何打击敌伪，而乃如何防止异党与消灭“共匪”，清等迫于军令，曾屡次含泪就命。停战令后，当局仍继续命令进行“剿共”内战，清等虽一介武夫，亦知和平团结之大义，思之再思，忍无可忍，乃不得不拒绝此次自相残杀之内战命令，致遭当局大军围剿。反动派之不顾人民利益，企图消灭异己破坏和平之阴谋，此次则更暴露无遗矣。清等既感于八路军、共产党和平民主救国之真诚，复受汾南各界人士之企望，遂一本初衷，与民主力量相结合，誓为保卫汾南人民利益与和平民主事业而继续奋斗。然半月以来，醉心于内战之蒋阎军，于围攻清等同时，亦大举向中共军驻区进攻，形势已万分严重，切望当政诸公与全国同胞，主持正义，立即制止反动派扩大内战之阴谋，停止对清等与中共部队之围剿，以及对汾南无辜民众之屠杀，并退出一切侵占区以实现和平。谨此电达，静侯明教。山西汾南地方特务团少将督导官王海清、上校团长雷文清率全体官兵三千余人谨白。六月二日
