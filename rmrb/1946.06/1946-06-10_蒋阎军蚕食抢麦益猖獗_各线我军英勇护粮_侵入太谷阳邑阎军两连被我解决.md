    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Triumphant news of the heroic struggle to protect grain is constantly coming from all fronts. (1) On the Datong-Puzhou and Zhengtai Fronts: On the 2nd of this month, a portion of the 16th Regiment of Yan Xishan's Security Forces in Taigu invaded Yangyi Town in our liberated area to seize wheat. Our troops then rose up to protect the grain, drove the Yan Xishan troops out of Yangyi Town, and disarmed all two companies of the Yan Xishan troops. On the 25th, more than 300 Chiang Kai-shek troops stationed in Xin Nanzhuang, Xia County, with eight carts, invaded Sanxian Village west of the county to seize wheat, and were all defeated by us. The Yan Xishan troops in Pingding and Yuci cities have also held meetings for days to discuss wheat seizure, deciding that villages within 20 miles of the city will be harvested by the "Village Self-Defense Corps," and villages beyond 20 miles will be invaded by troops to establish strongholds and seize the harvest. However, under the close surveillance and constant attacks of our local people's armed forces, the Yan Xishan troops' plot has not succeeded. (2) In the Northern Henan area: On the 31st of last month, the Chiang Kai-shek troops of the 145th Regiment of the 49th Brigade, entrenched in Hou Xudian, Wuzhi County, combined with the Wuzhi puppet Security Regiment, carrying two cannons, invaded Liu Fanqiao, Chen Fanqiao and other villages in the Xiuwu liberated area while our troops were away, seized four carts of wheat, burned all five piles of wheat that could not be transported from the threshing ground, and abducted 52 young men and 13 head of livestock. From the 25th to the 31st, the Wuzhi puppet Security Regiment and the puppet Liu Mingde's troops stationed in Yanjin invaded Xiafeng Village, Dayuan Village, and Weiqiuji three times to seize wheat. Under the heroic fighting of our grain protection team, the puppet troops fled in panic. On the 24th, the Chiang Kai-shek troops of the 158th Regiment of the 53rd Division in Potou, in coordination with the puppet troops of Wei Ansheng, advanced in three routes to seize wheat in Liuzhuang. When they invaded Zhenglaizhuang, they were intercepted by our Lianchi grain protection militia, and after four hours of fighting, the Chiang Kai-shek troops were finally repelled. Our militiamen, comrades Zhe Sheng and Xue Shuangxing, gloriously sacrificed their lives. On the 23rd, more than 300 Chiang Kai-shek troops of the 30th Army and the puppet Security Regiment of Qi County invaded Shangxia Village in Ji (County) and Qi (County) to seize wheat, and were also repelled by our troops. In the Tangyin and Huixian areas, the Chiang Kai-shek troops are organizing "returning home corps" to seize wheat, and are forcing each village on the border to provide 150 dan of wheat. (3) In the Shijiazhuang area: On the 3rd of this month, more than 300 puppet troops in Yuanshi, under the instigation of the Chiang Kai-shek troops, invaded Sucun in our area and seized more than 70 mu of wheat. The Chiang Kai-shek troops in Tongye, south of Shijiazhuang, seized twenty-one carts of wheat from the nearby masses. On the 4th, 300 men of the puppet Wei Yonghe's troops, carrying more than 80 carts, invaded Zhitu and other areas to seize wheat. Our grain protection troops bravely drove them back, killing and wounding more than ten people, and returning all the captured carts and livestock to the masses.
