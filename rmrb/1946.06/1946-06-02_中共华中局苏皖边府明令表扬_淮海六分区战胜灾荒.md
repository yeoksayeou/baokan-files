    CCP Central China Bureau Suwan Border Government Commendation:
    Huaihai Sixth Sub-district Overcomes Famine
    【Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 29th】The CCP Central China Bureau and the Suwan Border Region Government, on the 25th, issued a commendation to the Huaihai Sixth Sub-district Party Committee, Administrative Office, and Mass Organizations Federation for their leadership in guiding the people of the entire region in implementing the policy of production for self-salvation, rescuing millions of disaster victims, and overcoming the achievements of natural disasters. *Huazhong Xinhua Daily* also published an editorial on the same day titled "There Are No Difficulties We Cannot Overcome," praising the disaster relief achievements in the area. The famine in Huainan Sixth Sub-district was unprecedented in forty years. Thanks to the coordinated rescue efforts of the Party, government, army, and people, millions of disaster victims have gradually overcome their difficulties, and social order has remained stable. The area has adopted various disaster relief measures, including rent and interest reduction, punishing traitors, property redistribution, mutual assistance between the rich and poor, work-for-relief programs, affordable agricultural loans, developing sideline occupations, and organizing salt transportation. It also put forward the slogan "Disaster Relief is Like Fighting a Fire," calling on everyone to engage in production for self-salvation. Disaster victims with labor power all participated in production. In the Wuji District of Donghai, Li Yongming's family of twelve in Zi Village had run out of food since the beginning of the spring famine. However, by weaving cloth and transporting salt together, they are now able to not only feed and clothe themselves but also buy a cow in preparation for the summer harvest. In the Nanguan District, chain groups were widely organized to carry out chain mutual assistance. The Border Government also allocated a large amount of funds and grain for relief, including 200,000 catties of agricultural loan grain, 7.5 million yuan for the Grand Canal work-for-relief program, 850,000 catties of affordable grain, and 1.2 million yuan in a foundation. Cadres at all levels of the Party, government, army, and people saved 436,000 yuan worth of rations and old clothes, and raised 530,000 Huazhong currency yuan, 673,000 catties of grain, and 932,000 catties of miscellaneous grains through voluntary donations.
