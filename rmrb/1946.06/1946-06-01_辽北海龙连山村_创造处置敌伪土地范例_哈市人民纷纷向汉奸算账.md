    Xinhua News Agency, Yongji, 28th – Lian Shan Village in the Meihekou District of Hailong County, Liaobei Province, has distributed all the land forcibly occupied by enemies and puppets in the past to landless or land-poor farmers in just eighteen days. The village had a total of 7,006 mu of land, including reclaimed land, "Manchukuo" reclaimed land, and land belonging to traitors, of which 2,231 mu were paddy fields. This time, 658 households of poor people received land (accounting for 65% of the total number of households in the village), with an average of 7 to 8 mu per household. In addition, 892 mu were distributed to poor Korean farmers of Chinese nationality. Since the distribution of land, the fundamental problems of the peasants have been resolved, and the masses have been mobilized. Fifteen newly emerged activists have formed the leadership backbone of the village peasants' association. The following experiences were gained from this land distribution: (1) Boldly overcome purely economic viewpoints and the idea of absolute fairness and reasonableness. If there are individual improprieties, they can be discussed and adjusted democratically afterward. This is the only way to achieve the purpose of quickly mobilizing the masses. (2) Be good at absorbing and organizing a wider range of the masses to participate, such as middle peasants and those lacking labor, in order to expand the lineup and isolate saboteurs. (3) Clearly stipulate that the distribution principle is enemy and puppet land, and determine the grades according to various situations. The standards for dividing are: poor families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, those with no labor, those with no or little land, those with few workers and many mouths to feed, are classified as first class. Those with more labor and poor families are classified as second class. Middle peasants who can maintain their livelihood (except for wealthy owner-farmers) are classified as third class.
    The principle for land distribution to poor Korean farmers is: the total amount of land and the average amount per household obtained by Koreans of Chinese nationality must not exceed that of Chinese people. Military dependents, families of revolutionary martyrs, poorer households, and impoverished cadres of Koreans have the right to be distributed land. Whether or not to distribute to general poor households depends on the amount of enemy and puppet land in the local area. After poor Koreans of Chinese nationality are distributed land, they must abide by government laws. The government guarantees their private land ownership, but when the poor Koreans return to their country or move elsewhere, they must not sell the land rights for price, and it should be handled by the local government.
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 27th – Since liberation, the people of Harbin have risen up to settle accounts with the remnants of the enemies and puppets, demanding land distribution and rent reduction. Recently, people from all walks of life in Sankeshu have been holding meetings day and night to measure land in preparation for distribution. "Manchukuo" reclaimed land, Nangang District, and Dingxintun have distributed 200 mu of land belonging to the Guandong Army to more than 500 poor farmers in the village for cultivation. Village peasant associations have been established one after another, and the masses are very happy and express their enthusiastic support for the democratic government.

    辽北海龙连山村
    创造处置敌伪土地范例
    哈市人民纷纷向汉奸算账
    【新华社永吉二十八日电】辽北省海龙县梅河口区连山村，在十八天中，已将过去敌伪所强占之土地，全部分给无地或少地之劳苦农民。该村有开拓地、满拓地及汉奸土地共七千零六亩，内水田二千二百三十一亩。此次贫民分得土地者，有六百五十八户（占全村总户数百分之六十五），平均每户可得土地七至八亩，此外分给中国籍朝鲜贫民者，计八百九十二亩。自土地分配后，农民的根本问题得以解决，群众即发动起来。由十五名新涌现出的积极分子，构成了村农会的领导骨干。从此次分配土地中得到以下的经验：（一）大胆放手克服单纯经济观点，和绝对公平合理的想法，如有个别不妥之处，事后再民主讨论，予以调整。这样才能达到迅速发动群众的目的。（二）要善于吸收与组织更广泛的群众参加，如中农及缺乏劳动力者，以扩大阵容，孤立破坏分子。（三）明确规定分配原则是敌伪土地，根据各种情况，确定等级，划分的标准为：贫苦烈属、军属、全无劳动力、无地或少地、做事人少、吃饭人多家境较贫者，列为一等。劳动力多，家境清贫者，列为二等。生活尚能维持之中农（富裕之自耕农例外）列为三等。
    对朝鲜贫民土地分配的原则为：凡中国籍的鲜人所得土地之总数及每户平均数，均不得超过华人。鲜人之军属、烈属、较贫户及贫困干部，有分得土地之权，一般贫户是否分配，则按当地敌伪土地之多少而定。凡中国籍贫苦鲜人分得土地后，均须服从政府法令，政府保证其土地私有权，但该贫苦鲜人在返国或他迁时，不得变价转卖地权，应归当地政府处理之。
    【新华社哈尔滨二十七日电】哈市人民自获解放后，纷纷起来与敌伪残余算账，要求分地减租。近日三棵树各界人民，都整日整夜的开会，测量土地，准备分配。满拓地、南岗区、鼎新屯、已将关东军的二百亩垧地，分给屯中五百多户贫苦农民耕种。各村农会已次第建立，群众都非常高兴，对民主政府表示热忱拥护。
