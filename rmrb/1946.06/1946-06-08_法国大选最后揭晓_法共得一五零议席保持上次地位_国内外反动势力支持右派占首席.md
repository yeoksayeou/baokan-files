Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: Paris dispatch: The final results of the French elections on June 2nd have been announced. According to the official French announcement on the 4th, the final results for 575 of the 586 seats inside and outside France are as follows: Communist Party 150 seats (151 last time); Socialist Party 125 seats (139 last time); Right-wing Popular Republican Movement (MRP) 166 seats (144 last time); Radical Socialist Party 45 seats (26 last time); Fascist Republican Liberty Party 35 seats (same as last time); Other right-wing parties 25 seats; Farmers' Group 8 seats; Algerian Independence Party 11 seats; Other local parties 10 seats. In this election, French Communist leaders Thorez, Cachin, Marty, Florin, and Pont were all elected. Socialist leaders Auriol (former Speaker of the National Assembly) and General Secretary Meyrowitz were also elected. Other elected officials include MRP General Secretary Schuman, as well as the notorious Daladier and Reynaud. The following points are noteworthy in this election: 1. Although the French Communist Party, representing progressive forces, was opposed by reactionary right-wing parties, the number of seats it won remained the same as last time, demonstrating the deep-rooted influence of the French Communist Party among the French people and the strength of French democratic forces. 2. The reason why the MRP was able to take the lead with a slightly larger number of seats is, on the one hand, due to the full support of French financiers and its deceptive propaganda aimed at farmers; a large part of the farmers, who account for 40 percent of the French population, voted for the party, as well as the result of the wavering policies of the Socialist Party. The seats it gained were transferred from other parties and the Socialist Party; on the other hand, it was due to the support of foreign forces, such as American reporter Lippmann threatening French voters with Anglo-American military intervention, U.S. President's Chief of Staff Leahy's sudden visit to France, and the U.S. agreeing to provide loans to France on the eve of the election. At the same time, the Vatican Pope issued a call, urging Catholics around the world to launch a crusade against atheism and defeat the forces that destroy Christianity in the French and Italian elections. These had a certain effect. According to the French News Agency, Catholics in the western provinces of France voted for MRP candidates. 3. Within the Socialist Party, due to the refusal of its leading organs to cooperate with the French Communist Party and its wavering policies, it lost popular support, resulting in the loss of 14 seats.

    法国大选最后揭晓
    法共得一五零议席保持上次地位
    国内外反动势力支持右派占首席
    【新华社延安五日电】巴黎讯：六月二日的法国大选，已最后揭晓。据法官方四日发表法国国内外五百八十六席中，五百七十五席之最后结果如下：共产党得一五○席（上次为一五一席）；社会党一二五席（上次为一三九席）；右派之人民共和运动党一六六席（上次为一四四席），急进社会党四十五席（上次为二十六席）；法西斯的共和自由党三十五席（与上次同）；其他右翼党二十五席；农民集团八席；阿尔及尔独立党十一席；其他地方党十席。此次大选中，法共领袖多列士、加善、马尔梯、佛罗利、庞特均已当选。社会党领袖阿利奥尔（前任国会议长），梅罗总书记，亦已当选。其他当选人中，尚有人民共和运动党总书记舒曼，以及臭名远扬的达拉第与雷诺。这次大选有如下几点值得注意：一、代表进步力量的法共虽遭右派的反动党反对，但所得议席，仍保持上次的地位，可见法共在法国人民中影响的根深蒂固，以及法国民主力量的强大。二、人民共和运动党之所以能以略多的席数居于首位，一方面是由于法国大金融家的全力支持，它对农民的欺骗宣传，占法国人口百分之四十的农民大部选举该党，以及社会党的摇摆不定之政策的结果。它所增加的席数，是从其他党派及社会党那里转过来的；另一方面，由于外国势力的支持，诸如美记者李普曼以英美军事干涉恫吓法国选民，美总统参谋长李海之突然莅临法国，以及美国在大选前夕，答应对法贷款等，同时，梵蒂冈教皇一日发出呼号，要全世界天主教徒，对无神论展开十字军战争，要他们在法意选举中，击败摧毁基督教之势力。这些起了一定作用。据法新闻处讯：法西部各省天主教徒，都投票选举人民共和运动党候选人。三、社会党内由于其领导机关的拒与法共合作，及其政策的动摇，失却了民心，以致失掉了十四席。
