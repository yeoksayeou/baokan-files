    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: TASS, New York reports: American newspapers continue to reveal many facts proving that the United States is carrying out work against the national democratic demands of the Philippines. A "Worker's Daily" reporter stated: U.S. military police continue to exercise control in the Philippines, and recently prevented the removal of the military police chief of Central Luzon, because he was very effective in opposing democracy and the anti-Japanese People's Army. A "New York Times" reporter stated: U.S. congressional leaders are hurriedly preparing bills intending to strengthen the U.S. position in the Philippines before formally allowing Philippine independence. Pacific Research Institute intelligence claims: The U.S. Congress recently passed the Philippine Trade Act, which is an Americanized incarnation of Japan's Co-Prosperity Sphere.
