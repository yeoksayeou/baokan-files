    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 10th dispatch] A spokesman for the Taiyue Military Region recently issued a statement regarding the continued large-scale invasion of the Fenan Liberated Area by Chiang and Yan troops. The spokesman first emphasized that Chiang and Yan troops had violated the agreement by mobilizing over 20,000 troops to attack the Fenan Liberated Area for more than 20 days. Although our side has repeatedly protested, the Chiang and Yan troops have not only ignored these protests, but have intensified their efforts, advancing step by step from the Yi (Shi) Lin (Jin) area towards the Gu Shan area, and then towards the Ji Wang Shan area, attempting to completely eliminate the people's soldiers of Fenan. This action by the Kuomintang did not begin today. Tracing back to the Linfen group negotiations, Yan's representative obliterated the facts and denied the existence of the Fenan Liberated Area, which shows that their intention has been brewing for a long time. The spokesman then pointed out: Chiang and Yan's towering crime of sabotaging peace violates the will of the people across the country. Therefore, when the Chiang and Yan troops began their large-scale attack on the Fenan Liberated Area, Lei Wenqing and Wang Haiqing's troops of the Yan army's Fenan Self-Defense Army, with a clear understanding of righteousness, resolutely refused Chiang and Yan's order to engage in civil war, and led four regiments and one battalion in an uprising, joining our army in opposing civil war. The spokesman finally pointed out: Fenan has long been our liberated area for several years. Currently, the war in which Chiang and Yan troops are attacking our Fenan Liberated Area is extremely serious, and continues to spread to our Wenxi and Xiaxian Liberated Areas. A portion of Chiang's New 3rd Division has advanced to the liberated area between Wenxi and Xiaxian, and has continuously attacked us. The military and civilians in our liberated area have the greatest determination and strength to defend peace. If the Chiang and Yan troops do not immediately withdraw from the areas they have occupied, our military and civilians will resolutely rise up in self-defense, and the responsibility for all consequences shall be borne entirely by the invading Chiang and Yan troops.
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 10th dispatch] A portion of the Yan army in Xinjiang, in order to cooperate with the Chiang and Yan troops' attack on our Fenan Liberated Area, occupied Wan'an and Tiandimiao in our Xinjiang Liberated Area on the 28th of last month. Our army resolutely defended itself and recovered both places on the 3rd, killing or wounding more than 50 Yan soldiers, capturing more than 80 people, and seizing seven light machine guns.
    [This newspaper, Handan, 10th Urgent Dispatch] According to a recent confession by Wang Jinglin, a lieutenant of the Kuomintang army who laid down his arms to us: The Kuomintang army, in conjunction with puppet troops, will begin a large-scale invasion of the liberated areas on both wings of the Pinghan Railway on the 15th of this month, attempting to occupy Hua County, Daokou, and Jun County to the east of the railway, and Shuiye, Hebi, and Jiaozuo to the west of the railway. The troops participating in the attack include the entire 40th, 30th, 32nd, and 85th armies, one division of the 27th army, and local puppet troops. This conspiracy of the Kuomintang to expand the civil war in violation of orders should arouse serious vigilance among the people of the country!
    [Jinan, Weixian, 8th Dispatch] After the puppet troops of Tao Sheng, located in Taibao east of Anyang, occupied our villages of Mengzhuang, Chenzhuang, and Dongzhuang, they committed all kinds of evils, including rape and extortion. At the request of the local people, our army rescued the people from their suffering and recovered the three villages on the 18th. In total, more than 100 puppet soldiers were killed or wounded, more than 100 puppet soldiers were captured, one mortar was seized, nine light machine guns, and more than 140 rifles. At 3:00 PM on the 28th, more than 400 plainclothes troops of the puppet Wang Zi Quanbu invaded our Qianhou WanJin and Xinzhuang, attempting to build strongholds and encroach on our liberated areas. They came into contact with our army. The remnant puppets stubbornly resisted, and after fierce fighting until noon on the 29th, most of the puppet troops in Wanjin were eliminated. Later, the 40th Army and another unit of puppet Wang Zi Quanbu, totaling 700 people, reinforced the attack five times, but were all repelled by us. By the evening, all the puppet troops in Wanjin and Xinzhuang were disarmed. A total of more than 200 puppet soldiers were killed, more than 40 puppet soldiers were captured, and 92 people, including the puppet plainclothes captain Xue Zhenshan, squad leader Yang Kun, and the security captain, laid down their arms. We seized more than ten light machine guns, more than thirty pistols, and more than 180 rifles. We also suffered more than 70 casualties.

    蒋阎军步步进逼汾南解放区
    太岳我军将奋起自卫
    豫北顽伪军妄图犯我平汉两侧地区
    【本报阳城十日电】太岳军区发言人顷就蒋阎军继续大举进犯我汾南解放区发表谈话，首先着重指出蒋阎军违约调集大军两万余人对我汾南解放区进攻已达二十余日，我方虽然一再提出抗议，蒋阎军匪但置若罔闻，反而变本加厉，由猗（氏）临（晋）区向孤山区，继向稷王山区，步步进逼合击，窥其企图在于彻底消灭我汾南人民的子弟兵。国民党此种措施并非始自今日，溯自临汾小组谈判时，阎方代表抹煞事实，否认我汾南解放区之存在，即知其蓄意已久。发言人继即指出：蒋阎此种破坏和平之滔天罪行，实系违背全国人民意志，故在蒋阎军开始对我汾南解放区大举进攻时，阎军之汾南自救军雷文清、王海清部深明大义，坚决拒绝蒋阎军之内战命令，乃率领四个团、一个营起义，与我军并肩反对内战。发言人最后指出：汾南几年来早为我解放区，目前，蒋阎军进攻我汾南解放区之战事已极严重，并向我闻喜、夏县解放区继续发展，蒋军新三师一部已进至闻喜、夏县间之解放区，并连续向我进犯。我解放区军民素有保卫和平之最大决心与力量，蒋阎军如不立即退出已侵占之地区，我军民将坚决起而自卫，一切后果之责任应由进犯之蒋阎军完全担负。

    【本报邯郸十日急电】据最近国民党军向我放下武器的上尉王景林供称：国民党军结合伪军将于本月十五日开始大举向我平汉线两翼解放区进犯，企图占我路东之滑县、道口、浚县与路西之水冶、鹤壁、焦作等地区。参加进攻的部队计有四十、三十、三十二、八十五等军全部，二十七军之一个师及当地之伪军等。国民党此等违令扩大内战的阴谋，应引起国人严重警惕！
    【冀南威县八日电】安阳以东太保之伪军道生部侵占我孟庄、陈庄、董庄等村后，奸淫勒索无恶不作，我军应当地人民之请为解人民倒悬，于十八日将该三村收复。计毙伤伪百余人，俘伪百余人，缴迫击炮一门，轻机枪九挺，步枪一百四十余枝，二十八日下午三时伪王自全部便衣四百余人侵占我前后万锦、辛庄，企图修据点，向我解放区蚕食，当与我军接触。残伪凭坚顽抗，激战至二十九日午前，万锦之伪军被消灭大半，后复有四十军与伪军王自全另一部共七百余人五次增援，均被我击退。至晚将万锦、辛庄之伪军全部解除武装，计击毙伪军二百余名，俘伪四十余，伪便衣队长薛振山、小队长杨琨及警备队长以下九十二名放下武器，我缴轻机枪十余挺，驳壳枪三十余枝，步枪百八十余枝，我亦伤亡七十余名。
