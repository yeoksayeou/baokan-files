Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 24th: Paris dispatch: The Foreign Ministers' Conference's discussion on the economic clauses of the Italian peace treaty has largely come to an end. What has been agreed upon is limited to some technical issues (such as reparations to countries like Yugoslavia, economic clauses related to Romania and trade, etc.). Disagreements still exist and are being transferred to experts for discussion. The draft proposals of the American and British delegations make many economic demands on Italy. The nature and scope of most of these demands leave loopholes for independent action. The Soviet delegation believes that the correct principle of reparations is that Italy should pay reparations, but the excessively broad interpretation of demands on Italy should be curbed. Considering Italy's ability to pay, the Soviet side believes that, in all circumstances, only partial reparations should be granted. Therefore, the Soviet Union's demands for reparations from Italy are less than one-twentieth of the losses inflicted on the Soviet Union by Italian Fascism. As for the handling of economic demands other than reparations, Molotov once stated, "Countries of this type, like Italy, cannot be regarded as colonies by great powers exercising their hegemony, completely disregarding the interests of those countries." When the issue of reparations was specifically discussed, the American and British sides still opposed the Italian reparations plan proposed by the Soviet Union. On the contrary, they put forward demands at the meeting that were actually reparations (the United States had repeatedly declared in the past that they had waived any demands for reparations), although they only called it compensation for losses. As for the amount, the United States demanded $150 million, Britain demanded $40 to 50 million, and France demanded $45 million. Regarding the source of these compensation fees, the United States suggested using Italian assets in various Allied countries (including frozen cash in banks and ships) for payment. The Soviet Union believes that the losses of the United States cannot be compared with those of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and part of Italy's foreign assets should be returned to Italy for economic reconstruction. These are the process of the economic clauses discussion and the crux of its conclusion.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 23rd: Paris dispatch: The discussion on the Trieste issue at the Foreign Ministers' Conference has entered the decision stage. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes held a lengthy private meeting on the 22nd to try to resolve this difficult problem. Another informal secret meeting was held at 3 p.m. on the 22nd, attended by Molotov, Byrnes, Bevin, and Bidault. Byrnes insisted that the convocation of the European Peace Conference should not be far from July 15th. He said: "Although we have not been able to reach agreement on all issues, we are so close to agreement on so many issues that it is not harmful to submit the outstanding issues to the peace conference." Molotov said: "He does not agree to discuss the date of the peace conference until the foreign ministers have completed their study of the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland." Bevin proposed a compromise plan, that the final decision on convening the conference could be postponed for another week. No agreement was reached on this matter in the secret meeting.

　　对意经济条款讨论
    外长会议仍有分歧
    的港问题讨论已入决定阶段
    【新华社延安二十四日电】巴黎讯：外长会议对意和约中经济条款的讨论已大致告一段落。目前已这协议者，限于一些技术问题（如对苏南等国赔款、对罗马尼亚及有关贸易之经济条款等）仍有分歧，正移交专家的讨论中，美英代表团的草案，对意大利提出了许多经济要求，这些要求之绝大部分的性质与规模，都是留有独立行动的后门。苏联代表团方面也认为正确的赔偿原则是意大利应当赔偿，但要抑止对意要求之过分广泛的解释。在考虑到意大利的赔偿能力之后，苏方认为一切情形下，只能适予部分赔偿的原则，因此苏联对意所极赔偿要求，尚不及意国法西斯所予苏联损失的二十分之一，至于在赔偿以外的经济要求之处理，莫洛托夫曾经表示“不能把意大利这类型的国家看作是殖民地由巨大列强实行自己的霸权，根本不管那些国家的利益”。当具体进行赔偿问题的讨论时，美英方面仍反对苏联所提的意国赔偿方案。相反的，并在会上提出了实际上是赔款的要求（美国过去曾经一再宣称他们放众任何赔款要求），虽然他们只名之曰赔偿损失。至于数量，美国要求一万五千万元，英国要求四千万至五千万元，法国要求四千五百万元。关于这些赔偿费的来源，美国建议利用意大利在各联合国的财产（包括银行冻解之现金及航海船只等）偿付。苏联认为美国的损失，不能与苏、南两国相比较，意大利在国外财产的一部分，应归还意大利，以供给经济复兴之用。这些就是经济条款讨论的经过及其彻结之所在。
    【新华社延安二十三日电】巴黎讯：外长会议关于的里雅斯特问题的讨论，已进入意定阶段。苏外长莫洛托夫与美国务卿贝纳斯于二十二日进行长时间的单独会谈，试面解决这一难题。另一非正式的秘密会议，于二十二日下午三时举行，莫洛托夫、贝纳斯、贝文、比道尔俱出席，贝纳斯固执欧洲和会之召集，应不远于七月十五日。他说：“我们虽然尚未能在所有问题上获得协议，但我们在昨多问题上已经如此接近于协议，以致已不妨将未了的问题提交和平会议”。莫洛托夫称：“非至各外长完成了他产对意、罗、保、匈、芬诸国和约的研究时，他不同意对论和会之日期。贝文提出一折衷方案，即关于召集和会可延还一周再作最后决定。此事在秘密会议中，未获协议。
