    【Heze, June 12th, This paper】Wang Huayun, Director of the Yellow River Commission of the Jilu Yu Administrative Office, recently issued a statement regarding the embankment repair work in the Jilu Yu Liberated Area and the Kuomintang's delay in fulfilling the Nanjing Agreement, their failure to allocate funds for labor and relocation to this day, and their armed obstruction of the embankment repair project in the Liberated Area:
    After the Nanjing Agreement, the government and people of the Jilu Yu Liberated Area, under extremely difficult circumstances, started work ahead of schedule on the 26th of last month. On the 6th of this month, a joint meeting of the repair and defense offices and section chiefs was convened, and a construction plan for some urgent projects was formulated based on the "Preliminary Plan for Re-dredging the Old Course" of the Kaifeng Yellow River Commission. The plan was divided into three phases: The first phase was to repair the old embankments to their pre-diversion shape and to survey dangerous works. The second phase was to raise, thicken, and reinforce the dangerous works. The third phase was to straighten the bends. Because the surveying team from Kaifeng has not yet been dispatched, this meeting could only arrange the first phase of the repair work. This repair work requires a total of 15,078,926 cubic meters of earth, mobilizing 210,000 workers, and has started successively on the entire line since the morning of the 10th. If there are sufficient supplies, it can be completed within 25 days. However, regarding the current supply situation, only 100 tons of flour out of the originally agreed upon 25,000 tons of flour for labor have been delivered (with 200,000 workers, 270 tons of labor grain are needed daily), and only four vehicles and two theodolites and levels have been provided. The theodolites are old and unusable, and the amount is far from the urgent need. Moreover, not a single penny of the project funds has been allocated. Currently, the masses along the river are mostly borrowing grain and funds themselves, tightening their belts to start work. If the Kuomintang authorities and the UNRRA cannot guarantee the original supply, it will definitely affect the progress of the embankment repair work. If the surveying personnel cannot carry out the survey as soon as possible, the latter two phases of the project cannot be planned. In addition, after the start of the embankment repair project, the residents in the river channel are extremely panicked. The relocation and relief funds promised by the Executive Yuan of the Kuomintang government have not yet been allocated. The embankment repair project in the southern section of the old course, in the Kuomintang area, has not yet started. Recently, the Kuomintang troops in Kaocheng and Changyuan have even invaded villages on the river embankment, obstructing embankment repairs, and attacking road construction workers. This contradictory behavior of delaying supplies on the one hand and sabotaging the embankment repair work in the Liberated Area with armed force on the other cannot but make the masses greatly doubt the Kuomintang's sincerity in implementing the Nanjing Agreement and once again seriously alert them to their intention of breaching the dikes. The government and people of Jilu Yu are determined to endure hardship and resolutely implement the Nanjing Agreement to actively carry out the embankment repair project for self-salvation. However, we firmly demand that Marshall, Zhou Enlai, Frankner, Jiang Tingfu, and Xue Dubi督促 the Kuomintang to immediately implement the Nanjing Agreement, so that the people of the five provinces of Jilu Yu Su Wan may be spared from the scourge of the Yellow River again.
    Another dispatch: The Yellow River Commission of the Jilu Yu Administrative Office specially sent representatives Cheng Run, along with UNRRA's Peng Anjie, Hansen, and two others, to Bian on the 7th to negotiate again regarding the supply issue.
    【Heze, June 12th, This paper】Just as the government and people of the Jilu Yu Liberated Area were going all out to carry out the embankment repair work, the Kuomintang authorities actually instructed their troops to cooperate with the puppet troops to sabotage our embankment repair and road construction work for days on end. In order to facilitate the transportation of equipment and labor grain needed for river management, the Jilu Yu Administrative Office and UNRRA jointly decided to build the He (Ze) Kao (Cheng) highway. The Jilu Yu Highway Bureau specially mobilized more than a thousand people to actively rush to repair it. One day, when the repair reached Mengzhai, a unit of the 74th Division of the 55th Army of the Kuomintang army stationed in Mafang (20 miles northeast of Kaocheng), with 500 soldiers, rushed to Caozhuang to attack the road construction workers and militiamen, seriously injuring two militiamen. On the 8th, a unit of the 68th Army of the Kuomintang stationed in Changyuan, under the pretext of establishing a river defense office, invaded the Liberated Area and set up strongholds in Yantanzhuang to prevent the masses from starting embankment repairs. On the same day, a unit of the puppet Third District Team entrenched in the county rushed to eight villages in our Liberated Area, including Daxiao Huangzhuang and Louzhai, arrested the village chiefs, and threatened the masses, saying: "Whoever repairs the embankment for the Eighth Route Army will have their whole family killed." This is another powerful proof of the Kuomintang authorities' attempt to use the return of the Yellow River to its old course as a pretext to plot to inundate the army and people in the Liberated Area. The Yellow River Commission of the Jilu Yu Administrative Office has urgently telegraphed Marshall, Zhou Enlai, and Xue Dubi to protest to the Kuomintang authorities and demand that they immediately stop this conspiratorial action to sabotage the Nanjing Agreement and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future.

    国民党破坏复堤工程
    我坚决要求马、周等督促国方履行南京协议，俾五省同胞免于水患
    【本报荷泽十二日电】冀鲁豫行署黄委会主任王化云氏，顷就冀鲁豫解放区复堤工作，及国民党方面拖延履行南京协议，至今仍不拨发工款及迁移费，并以武装阻扰解放区复堤工程之进行，特发表谈话如下：
    南京协议后，我冀鲁豫解放区政民，在极端困难情况下，即于上月二十六日提前动工。并于本月六日召集各修防处、段长联席会，根据开封黄委会之“故道复浚工作初步计划”，制定部分急要工程施工计划。该项计划共分为三期：第一期，为修补旧堤至改道前之堤形，及勘估险工。第二期，加高培厚及整理险工。第三期，为裁弯取直。因开封之测量队至今仍未派来，此次会议仅能布置第一期之修补工程。该项修补工程，共需一千五百零七万八千九百二十六方土，发动工人二十一万名，自十日晨全线已陆续开工。如有充分供给，二十五日内即可完成。但目前供给情形，原来商定之工粮面粉二万五千吨，至今只运来面粉一百吨（以二十万工人计，每日即需工粮二百七十吨），汽车亦仅四辆。经纬、水平仪各两部。而经纬仪则已破旧不能使用，较急需数量相差甚巨。且工款尚未拨一文，现在沿河群众，多自行借粮借款，缩食动工。如国民党当局与联总行总仍不能保证原定供给，定将影响复堤工作之进行。如测量人员不能早日进行测量，则后两期工程亦无从计划。此外复堤工程开工后，河道内居民极为恐慌。国民党政府行政院所允拨之迁移救济费，迄今仍无拨发消息。故道，南段国民党地区之复堤工程，仍未动工。近日考城、长垣之国民党部队，更进犯河堤村庄，阻扰复堤，并袭击修路群众。这种一面拖延供给，一面以武装破坏解放区复堤工作的背谬行为，不能不使群众对国民党执行南京协议的诚意，感到极大怀疑，并再一次严重警惕其堵口动机。冀鲁豫政民决仍忍难耐苦，坚决执行南京协议，积极进行复堤工程，以求自救。但我们坚决要求马歇尔、周恩来、福兰克纳、蒋廷黻、薛笃弼诸氏，督促国民党立即执行南京协议，俾使冀鲁豫苏皖五省同胞免于再受黄水浩劫。
    又讯：冀鲁豫行署黄委会为供应问题，已于七日特派代表成润、偕联总彭安杰、韩森等四人赴汴再度交涉。
    【本报荷泽十二日电】正当冀鲁豫解放区政民全力进行复堤工作之际，国民党当局，竟指使其军队配合伪军连日破坏我复堤修路工作。为便利运输治河所需之器材工粮，冀鲁豫行署与联总行总共同商定，修筑荷（泽）考（城）公路，冀鲁豫公路局特发动群众千余人积极赶修，一日晨修至孟寨时，驻马房（考城东北廿里）之国民党五十五军七十四师一部五百余，竟窜至曹庄袭击修路之群众及民兵，致民兵二人负重伤。八日驻长垣国民党六十八军一部，又以设修防处为名，侵犯至解放区，阎谭庄安扎据点以阻止群众动工复堤。同日盘踞该县之伪三区队一部，窜至我解放区大小黄庄、楼砦等八村，捕走村长，并恐吓群众说：“谁给八路军复堤，杀其全家。”此为国民党当局企图以黄河归故为名，阴谋淹害解放区军民之又一有力证明。冀鲁豫行署黄委会已急电马歇尔、周恩来、薛笃弼，向国民党当局提出抗议，要求立刻制止此种破坏南京协议之阴谋行动，并保证今后不再发生类似事件。
