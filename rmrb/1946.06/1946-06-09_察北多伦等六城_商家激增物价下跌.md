Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 4th:  After half a year of dedicated construction, the industrial and commercial centers of Chahar North, including Zhangbei, Dolon, Shangdu, and Kangbao, have experienced significant economic and cultural development. The number of large businesses has rapidly increased from 480 to over 1,000, while street vendors have surged from 680 to over 1,200. Workshops have grown from over 30 to 157. The daily import and export volume of fur, grain, cloth, and saltpeter exceeds 400 tons. Due to the expansion of local products and smooth transportation, prices have generally fallen, and the disparity between the prices of agricultural products and industrial goods has been greatly reduced. Before liberation, farmers had to exchange four dou of wheat for a bolt of homespun cloth or fifteen jin of flour for one jin of crude salt. Now, less than two dou of wheat can buy a good bolt of homespun cloth, and one and a half jin of flour can buy one jin of pure salt, resulting in a significant improvement in farmers' living standards. In education, Zhangbei, Huade, Baohang and other five counties alone have established ten complete primary schools and 271 regular primary schools, a fourfold increase compared to the past. The number of enrolled children has reached over 12,300, an increase of more than tenfold. In addition, the democratic government has also focused on helping to establish 84 schools, enrolling over 3,000 workers and peasants.

    察北多伦等六城
    商家激增物价下跌
    【新华社宣化四日电】察北之工商业中心张北、多伦、商都、康堡等六城，经过半年来努力建设，经济文化大有发展。大商行由过去四百八十家迅速增至一千余家，摊贩由过去六百八十户迅速增至一千二百多户，作坊由过去三十余处增至一百五十七处，每日出入口皮毛、粮食、布匹、盐卤，均在四百吨以上。由于土产扩大，运输畅通，物价普遍下跌，农产品与工业品价格的剪刀叉悬殊，已大有改变。解放前，农民换一匹土布须四斗小麦，换一斤青盐须十五斤面粉，现在不足二斗小麦即可换得上好土布一匹，一斤半面粉即可换纯盐一斤，因之农民生活显著改善。教育事业仅张北、化德、宝沆等五县，即已建立完小十处，普小二百七十一处，较过去增加四倍。入学儿童达一万二千三百余人，增加十倍有余。此外，民主政府并有重点的帮助开办学校八十四处，入学工农群众三千余人。
