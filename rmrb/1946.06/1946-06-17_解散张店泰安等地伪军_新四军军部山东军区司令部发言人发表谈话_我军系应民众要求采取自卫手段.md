Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 12th: A spokesperson for the New Fourth Army Headquarters and the Shandong Military Region Command recently issued a statement regarding the dissolution of puppet troop armed forces in Zhangdian, Zhoucun, Jiaoxian, Zaozhuang, Tai'an, and other areas, stating: The Kuomintang reactionaries have not only long violated the Three Major Agreements but are also frantically deploying a nationwide civil war. In the Northeast, disregarding the repeated concessions made by the Democratic Allied Army, they continue to chant "complete takeover" after entering Siping Street and Changchun, as a pretext for expanding the civil war. At the same time, they have adopted severe military pressure and sudden encirclement tactics against the liberated areas in North China and East China. Recently, they have also invaded the Huainan Road West liberated area in Central China, centered on Dingyuan City and Outang Town, occupying a large area. Furthermore, they have concentrated 200,000 heavily armed troops along the line from Nantong to Yangzhou, north of the Yangtze River, to encircle and annihilate our army in Central Jiangsu. As for the Shandong area, in addition to continuously strengthening military pressure through air and land transport, they have recently launched large-scale attacks and frantically seized grain. The spokesperson continued by addressing the puppet troop issue, stating: The Beiping Military Mediation Department's repeated orders contain detailed and clear provisions regarding the dissolution of puppet troops. However, certain individuals on the Kuomintang side regard the notorious large and small puppet troops as precious treasures – "loyal comrades" or "underground workers." Not only have they failed to dissolve and punish them but have instead promoted and praised them, using them as vanguards in the civil war. As a result, puppet troops within Shandong have become even more rampant in recent months, repeatedly violating agreements by attacking and nibbling at our territory thousands of times, causing harm to tens of thousands of peaceful residents. The Shandong Kuomintang authorities have repeatedly violated agreements by providing them with military supplies and food. Therefore, the puppet troops have become even more fierce and arrogant. Our representative on the Executive Group first disappeared in Gaomi and was then beaten in Zaozhuang, endangering his life and safety. Furthermore, on the 8th of this month, Wang Jimei, the traitorous puppet troop leader in Zaozhuang, released vesicant poison gas, poisoning eight soldiers of our 20th Brigade. At this time of the summer harvest, puppet troops from various areas are also actively mobilizing to seize grain. We have repeatedly protested against all of this, but our words have fallen on deaf ears. People in various areas have repeatedly requested our army to impose forceful sanctions, and our army has been forced to take self-defense measures. Finally, the spokesperson declared: Our military and civilians in the Central China and Shandong liberated areas have made significant concessions in the past for the cause of domestic peace, and we will continue to uphold our past spirit of forbearance for the sake of the country for the peace cause of today and tomorrow, conducting fair and reasonable peace negotiations to promote progress in the Shandong situation. We believe that the door to peace remains open, and there is no shortage of those who uphold democracy and justice. We have now begun to restore transportation and production in areas where puppet troops have been disarmed and continue to negotiate and conduct normal work with American and Kuomintang figures in the local areas.

    解散张店泰安等地伪军
    新四军军部山东军区司令部发言人发表谈话
    我军系应民众要求采取自卫手段
    【新华社临沂十二日电】新四军军部及山东军区司令部发言人，顷就解散张店、周村、胶县、枣庄、泰安等地伪军武装事，发表谈话称：国民党反动派不但早已破坏三大协定，而且疯狂的布置全国内战，在东北则不顾民主联军的一再忍让，于进入四平街、长春之后，继续高唱“全面接收”，作为扩大内战的张本。同时又对华北华东各解放区，采取严重的军事压迫与突然包围。近又侵占华中解放区淮南路西以定远城及藕塘镇为中心之大块地区，并在长江以北南通至扬州一线，集中二十万重兵，围歼苏中我军。至于山东地区除了不断空运陆运，加强军事压力外，近更大肆进攻，疯狂抢粮。发言人继就伪军问题声称：北平军调部迭次命令中，关于解散伪军一事，早有详密之明文规定，无奈国民党方面某些人士，对臭名远扬的大小伪军，视作掌中明珠——“忠实同志”，或“地下工作者”，非但未予解散与惩办，反而晋级褒扬，充作内战先锋，以致数月来，山东境内伪军更形猖獗，多次违约向我进攻蚕食，数以千次计。残害和平居民，竟达万人。而山东国民党当局，反而一再违约援助其军火与食粮，因此伪军更凶焰万丈。执行小组我方代表，一则失迹于高密，再则被殴于枣庄，生命危殆，安全堪虞。而本月八日枣庄伪军王逆继美，更施放糜烂性毒气，我二十旅八名战士中毒。当此夏收之际，各地伪军更纷纷出动抢粮。凡此种种，我方曾多次提出抗议，但是言者谆谆，听者藐藐。各地人民均纷纷要求我军予以有力制裁，我军乃不得不采取自卫手段。最后，发言人宣称：我华中及山东解放区军民，为了国内和平事业，过去曾作重大让步，而对今天与明天的和平事业，仍将一本以往相忍为国之精神，进行公平合理之和平谈判，促使山东局面得以向前进展。我们相信和平大门，依然洞开；主持民主正义者，仍不乏人。我方现已使伪军已被解除武装之地区，立即进行恢复交通，恢复生产等工作，并与当地美国方面国民党方面人士继续谈判，与进行正常工作。
