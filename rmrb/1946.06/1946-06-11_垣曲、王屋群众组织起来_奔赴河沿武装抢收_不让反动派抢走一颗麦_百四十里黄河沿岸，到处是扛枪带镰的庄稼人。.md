[Reported by our newspaper from Yangcheng] Yuanqu Masses Organize Armed Forces to Protect the Riverbank, Protect the Summer Harvest, and Engage in Rushing to Harvest and Cut. Part of the armed forces from the Second and Third Districts are marching to protect the river defense. Along the 140-plus li of the Yellow River, everywhere are peasants carrying guns. They vow not to let the Kuomintang troops cross the river and not to let them seize a single grain of wheat. These mass armed forces include all kinds of talent: there are veterans with rich combat experience who have retired from the army, sailors who live on the Yellow River, and peddlers who run all year round, each using their abilities to work hard to protect the summer harvest. The sailors on the Yellow River often scout the activities of the troops on the opposite bank in the Yellow River, monitoring the activities of special agents. The experienced veterans, like commanders, command their own peasant soldiers, arranging barbed wire arrays and stone mine arrays. In order to protect grain, eleven villages, including Yuanqu Kounei, Nanbu, Liucun, Tongshan, Lishan, Wangxian, and Jinfu, have reinforced the river defense twice. The first time, × hundred people defended ××kou, and the second time, another × hundred people reinforced the defense of ××kou. When the two reinforcement teams set off, the masses earnestly instructed, "Don't let the stubborn troops cross the river!" They also launched armed activities, purchased weapons, such as stone mines, increasing by 475 in ten days. They called for one per household and had strict sentries to check pedestrians. In addition, mutual aid teams were organized. Liucun has voluntarily organized 34 teams, Jindan Village 11 teams, and Tongshan Town 11 teams. They are prepared to harvest wheat quickly and hide it quickly, while also helping the militiamen and families of soldiers who are defending the river mouth to harvest wheat.
    [Reported by our newspaper from Yangcheng] Two thousand masses in the heartland of Wangwu County are setting off to help the masses in villages along the (Yellow) River with a rush wheat harvest, showing a high degree of solidarity and friendship among the peasants. The summer wheat in northern Henan has long been ripe, and the Kuomintang army is actively looting it. In order to protect the summer harvest of the masses, our democratic government has called on all the farmers in the county to launch a summer harvest mutual aid campaign: (1) Farmers in villages along the river will take turns on guard duty, so that they can be on guard while harvesting wheat; one hand holding a sickle and the other holding a gun. (2) Mobilize farmers in the interior to go to various villages along the river to help with the rush harvest. At present, a total of 719 people have been mobilized in the First District of Wangwu, and more than 40 farmers in Shaoyuan Town have brought their own dry food and do not want wages, showing the spirit of mutual assistance and love of farmers all over the world. The Second and Third Districts each mobilized 700 people, all of whom set off around May 31. It is estimated that the summer wheat in the villages along the river will be harvested within three days with the help of more than 2,000 people.
