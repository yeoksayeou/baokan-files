    [This Newspaper's Report] Yang Naiqi, a young teacher from Tinghepu, Li Cheng, found very few students when he first arrived at his post. He immediately went among the masses to inquire, and heard them say: "Studying for a year and not being able to write one's own name is not as good as doing some work at home." He thought: To run the school well, it is necessary to earnestly teach literacy and teach students to acquire real skills. After some time, the masses saw that there were achievements in learning, and their impression gradually changed, and they sent their children to school. He also saw that some students' families were too busy, so he established a night school. At first there were only four people, and he patiently taught them himself with lamp oil. Because of the success of their learning, the number of people increased day by day. The masses suggested that the teacher should not pay for the lamp oil, and they all said: "With such a good teacher, what are we waiting for if we don't study?" In two tests in the seventh district, the school ranked first. At the district-wide teachers' conference, Yang Naiqi was elected as a model. The main reason he was able to achieve these results was that his schooling adapted to the needs of the masses. (Ma Jinke)

    黎城七区召开教员会
    杨乃奇当选教员模范
    长处是教学适应群众需要
    【本报讯】黎城停河铺青年教员杨乃奇，初到岗位时，学生很少，他即深入群众访问，听到反映说：“念书一年不会写自己名，不如在家做点活”。他想：要办好必需认真教识字，教学生学到真本领。过了些时，群众见学习有成绩，印象慢慢改变，送子入学。他又见有些学生家中太忙，即成立夜校，起初只有四人，他自己拿灯油耐心教，学习有成绩，人数一天天加多，群众提出不要先生出灯油，都说：“这样好的先生，不念书还等啥”。七区两次测验，该校均占第一，全区教员大会上杨乃奇被选为模范。他所以能取得这些成绩，主要是他办学适应群众需要。（马金科）
