The Fen'nan Liberated Area Opened Up and Persisted in by the Chinese Communist Party
Li Zhuang

In 1938, when the enemy invaders were coveting southern Shanxi, the Kuomintang Shanxi authorities retreated south in a panic. The fertile fields of the Fen River basin immediately fell into enemy hands. The Communists in Fen'nan, under the correct guidance of the CPC Central Committee's policy of "Persisting in the War of Resistance in North China" and "Vowing not to retreat across the Yellow River, and to live and die with the people of Fen'nan," immediately mobilized the local people to establish county task forces, guerrilla teams, people's self-defense forces, and the regular armed forces of Fen'nan—the Eighth Route Army Huang Hua Detachment. Combined with the Shanxi New Army 212th Brigade, the 10th Regiment of Guerrillas, the 11th Regiment of Guerrillas, and the political defense battalions of various counties, they persisted in the anti-Japanese guerrilla war in Fen'nan, opened up the Fen'nan base area, harassed the enemy, stabilized the people's hearts, held back the long-driving, seemingly invincible enemy, and defended the Yellow River.

In the autumn, in order to consolidate the people's confidence in the war of resistance, the Communist Eighth Route Army in Fen'nan put forward the slogan "Blood Sacrifice to September 18th" and launched widespread attacks throughout Fen'nan, carrying out famous battles such as Yangchenggou (between Xinfeng and Jishan), North and South Niu Chi (Wanquan), Sanlu Licun (Anyi), Zuodi River, Heyun, and Meiyang Town (Yishi). Many communists, such as Yue Dai (a student at Tsinghua University), exchanged their blood and heads for the victory of the motherland's war. This forced the enemy's Commander Niu Dao of the division, who was in charge of the invasion war in southern Shanxi at the time, to say: "Fen'nan is the appendicitis of North China. The Communist army in Fen'nan must be annihilated before crossing the Yellow River." In the spring of 1939, the enemy launched a nine-pronged encirclement attack with 20,000 troops against our Fen'nan Liberated Area, which was crushed by our Fen'nan Eighth Route Army, the Shanxi Army, and the broad masses of the people.

Failing in one attack, the enemy soon combined with Cai Qingshan's bandit troops of more than 3,000 men in Fen'nan to launch another large-scale offensive against us. They also allowed the return of 49 percent of Yan Xishan's property in Taiyuan in order to induce his surrender. In response to this insidious conspiracy of the enemy, the Fen'nan Eighth Route Army and the Shanxi New Army launched a large-scale attack in November on Wanquan City and Zhaidian Town in Jishan, eliminating the habitual bandits Cai Qingshan and others, relieving the suffering of the people in Heze, Wanquan, Ronghe, Jiexian, Yuxiang and other places, and striking at Yan Xishan's anti-communist surrender conspiracy, abolishing the security of the Kuomintang army in Zhongtiao and Lüliang and the people on the south bank of the Yellow River.

In December of that year, Yan Xishan launched a bloody December coup against the anti-Japanese army and civilians. The Eighth Route Army and the Shanxi New Army in Fen'nan took the overall situation into consideration and retreated with pain. They were repeatedly attacked by the enemy Yan army along the way. In the fierce battles at Sanxianding and Aikou, the junction of Wenxi, Feng County, and Quwo, the Eighth Route Army and the Shanxi New Army suffered many painful losses.

When these troops retreated, the broad masses of the local people desperately tried to keep them. The Eighth Route Army and the Shanxi New Army could not bear to see this great land fall into the hands of the enemy, so they planned to leave behind many Communist Party members and guerrilla units to continue to persist in the Fen'nan War of Resistance. In order to commemorate Comrade Jia Kangjie, who sacrificed himself in the December coup, the Kangjie Detachment was established. Subsequently, Communist Party members Fan Mayi and Song Yanlong, in combination with the local people, established the Fan Song Detachment and the anti-Japanese guerrilla teams in various counties to maintain the difficult situation in Fen'nan.

In May 1941, the enemy launched the Battle of Zhongtiao Mountain. The 200,000 Kuomintang troops gathered in the Zhongtiao Mountain area were lax in their vigilance against the enemy and specialized in opposing the Communists and the people. They collapsed at the first touch, and most of them were captured or annihilated. The rest either became puppet troops or degenerated into bandits, cooperating with the enemy to attack the local Eighth Route Army. However, the Eighth Route Army and the broad masses of the people were not intimidated by this dangerous situation. They continued to expand the anti-Japanese armed forces and persist in the guerrilla war with firm confidence in victory. By 1944, they had created liberated areas in Xinjiang, Heze, Jishan, Wanquan, Linjin and other counties, and persisted until the enemy surrendered. The Eighth Route Army launched a large-scale counter-offensive and successively recovered vast territories in Wenxi, Jishan, and Linjin.

Recalling the eight years of the War of Resistance, the Eighth Route Army and the people of Fen'nan fought together against the enemy more than 4,240 times, killing and wounding more than 5,000 enemy and puppet troops, turning the Fen'nan Liberated Area, which was heavily surrounded by the enemy, into a free and happy paradise. There is a folk song among the people of Fen'nan that says: "The Central Army retreated to the south bank of the Yellow River, the Jin Sui Army colluded with the enemy to make trouble, and the Eighth Route Army persisted in the Fen'nan War of Resistance." This is the most objective and truthful assessment of the broad masses of the people.

    中共开辟和坚持着的汾南解放区
    李庄
    在一九三八年，敌寇进窥晋南的时候，国民党山西当局仓皇南撤，汾河流域的肥美田园顿陷敌手，汾南的共产党人在中共中央“坚持华北抗战”、“誓死不退过黄河、与汾南人民共存亡”的正确方针之下，立即发动当地人民，建立了各县县干队、游击队、人民自卫队及汾南正规武装——八路军黄华支队，结合山西新军二一二旅、游十团、游十一团及各县政卫营等，坚持了汾南的抗日游击战争，开辟了汾南根据地，袭扰敌寇、稳定人心，拖住长驱直入、不可一世的敌人，保卫了黄河。
    在秋天，汾南的共产党八路军为了巩固人民的抗日信心，提出“血祭九一八”的口号，在汾南各地普遍出击，进行了阳城沟（新ｆéｎｇ＠②稷山间）、南北牛池（万泉）、三路李村（安邑）、坐底河、河运、ｍéｉ＠①阳镇（猗氏）等著名战斗。许多共产党员如岳岱（清华大学学生）等以自己的鲜血头颅，换来祖国战争的胜利。迫使当时指挥晋南侵略战争的敌牛岛师团长说：“汾南是华北的盲肠炎，不歼灭汾南的共产军就不能过黄河。敌人在一九三九年春天发动了两万人的向我汾南解放区的九路围攻，结果被我汾南八路军、山西军及广大人民粉碎了。
    敌寇一攻不成，不久又结合汾南惯匪蔡庆山部三千余人，向我再次发动大举进攻。并允许退还阎锡山在并财产的百分之四十九，以诱其投降。汾南八路军及山西新军针对敌寇这种毒辣阴谋，于十一月间向万泉城与稷山之翟店镇等地大举出击，肃清惯匪蔡庆山等，解除了河泽、万泉、荣河、解县、虞乡等地人民的痛苦，打击了阎锡山反共投降阴谋，废除了中条、吕梁等地的国民党军和黄河南岸人民的安全。
    是年十二月阎锡山向抗日军民发动血腥的十二月政变。汾南的八路军和山西新军顾全大局，忍痛撤退，沿途迭遭敌阎军夹击，在闻喜、ｆéｎｇ＠②县、曲沃间三县交界之三县顶及隘口的惨烈战斗中，八路军及山西新军遭受了不少痛心的损失。
    在这些部队撤退的时候，当地广大人民苦苦挽留，八路军和山西新军也不忍这大好河山沦于寇手，于是有计划的遗留了很多共产党员和游击部队，继续坚持汾南抗战。为了纪念在十二月政变中牺牲的贾康杰同志，成立了康杰支队，继而又有共产党员樊马义、宋延龙结合当地人民，成立了樊宋支队及各县的抗日游击队，坚持危难的汾南局面。
    四一年五月，敌寇发动中条战役。集结在中条山区的疏于对敌戒备，专门反共反人民的二十万国民党军，一触即溃，大部被俘被歼，其余的或变成伪军，或沦为土匪，配合敌寇向当地八路军进攻。但是八路军和广大人民并未被这种艰险的局面所吓倒，他们仍以坚强的胜利信心继续扩大抗日武装，坚持游击战争，至四四年，又创造了新绛、河泽、稷山、万泉、临晋等县之解放区，一直坚持到敌寇投降时，八路军大举反攻，先后收复了闻喜、稷山、临晋等县的广大国土。
    回忆抗战八年中，汾南八路军和人民共同对敌作战四千二百四十余次，毙伤敌伪五千余人，使被敌寇重重包围着的汾南解放区变成一片自由幸福的乐土。汾南人民有一首歌谣说：“中央军退到黄河南岸，晋绥军勾结敌人捣乱，八路军坚持汾南抗战。”这是广大人民最客观而真实的鉴定。
