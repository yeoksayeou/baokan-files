The Story of Liu Jin’an’s Family in Neihuang Where Democratic Meetings United the Family

Liu Jin’an from Dongwang Village, Third District, Neihuang County, is 35 years old. He was a businessman and is now an exchange member at Shunheji. He has a wife and three children. His third younger brother, Bao’an, is 30 years old, and his fourth younger brother, Yong’an, is 25 years old. Both have a wife and a child. During the famine years, they went out to escape the famine and only returned last March. Now the whole family has a total of eleven people and 26.6 mu of land. Jin’an does business, and the third and fourth brothers participate in mutual aid farming. In addition, they also do sideline businesses such as oil extraction and transportation. Last autumn, in addition to taking care of the family's life, they also bought 11.6 mu of land and reclaimed 3 mu of land. The family was visibly improving.

However, trouble also followed. Jin’an's wife felt that she had lived casually for the past two years when she was alone. Now that there were eleven people in the family, the standard of living had been reduced. Clothing allowances were divided equally among the three brothers, and she felt that her children were at a disadvantage since she had more children. In addition, Bao’an’s wife had been ill since she came back, only able to eat and not work, with medicine expenses alone costing more than nine thousand yuan. She felt dissatisfied. Bao’an’s wife felt that her husband was working himself to death, but everything was managed by the elder brother and sister-in-law. When the sisters-in-law were not at home, the sister-in-law would eat good food. She felt wronged and didn't want to work. This led to mutual complaints and dissatisfaction. Coupled with gossip from neighbors, quarrels were frequent. As time went on, the brothers also became depressed. Jin'an thought, it would be best to let everyone pour out their grievances to try, but if it didn't work, they would each take care of themselves.

One evening, a family meeting was held, presided over by Jin’an. Jin’an’s wife spoke first: “Our five people get the same allowance as their three people, and we all do the work. She, the third sister-in-law, is a little sick, but we can’t just ask others to do the work.” Then Bao’an’s wife said, “You manage the family, you can say whatever you want. That day when we were grinding, who of you pushed it even once?” They went back and forth, and no one was convinced. Jin’an said, “Tell me, what are you thinking about in your hearts all day long? You must tell the truth.” Jin’an’s wife said, “I feel like we can’t live well anyway, so if anything happens, we don’t discuss it. I don't like anything, and no one makes concessions.” Bao’an’s wife said, “When I was sick, they all troubled me. Now that I’m better, I feel very sad, and I have no energy to work.” This revealed the crux of the matter. Jin’an said, “If you had said these words earlier, wouldn’t it have been resolved? In the future, as long as we discuss things more.” Bao’an’s wife said, “If we can discuss things, how much resentment can there be among our own people? If we talk face to face, no one will quarrel anymore. The family still needs the second sister-in-law to manage it.” Jin’an’s wife said, “It’s good as long as you don’t think I’m useless. If everyone discusses it well, I always have to move forward.” Jin’an said, “In the future, allowances and things will be divided equally according to the number of people.” Everyone agreed.

After the meeting, the whole family realized that as long as meetings were held and things were made clear, things could be done. Their production enthusiasm was very high. On the tenth day of the third month, they held another meeting and made economy plans. In the past, they used four liters of flour every day, but now they only use two and a half liters for cooking vegetables. When the sisters-in-law live at their parents' homes, they will still be treated according to the rules and will not eat anything extra. Jin’an continues to do business, and the brothers work at home. The whole family is harmonious and energetic than before.

    开了民主会，家庭团结了！
    ——内黄刘金安家的故事
    内黄县三区东王村刘金安，三十五岁，商人出身，现在顺河集当交易所员，家中有一个老婆，三个小孩。三弟保安，三十岁，四弟永安，二十五岁，都有一个老婆，一个小孩，灾荒年间，出去逃荒，去年三月才回来。现在全家共十一口人，二十六亩六分地。金安做买卖，三弟、四弟参加互助种地外，还做打油、运输等副业，去年秋后，除照顾全家生活外，又买地十一亩六分，回地三亩，眼看着家庭上升了。
    可是闹气的事也接着来了，金安妻觉得前两年独自过，生活随便，现在一家十一口，把生活折薄了，穿衣分花按弟兄三人平分，自己孩子多，吃了亏，又加上保安妻自回来就病，只能吃，不能做，单吃药费了九千多元，心中不满。保安妻觉着自己丈夫死做活，凡事都是哥嫂当家，妯娌们不在家时，嫂嫂就吃好的，觉着自己受屈，不想做活。这样互相埋怨，互相不满，加上邻居说个闲话，争吵常常不断，日子久了，弟兄们也苦闷起来，金安想，还是让大家倒倒苦水试试，弄不好就各顾各。
    在一个晚上由金安主持，开了家庭会议，金安妻先说：“俺五口人和三口人一样分花，做活都做，他三婶子就有点病吧，也不能光叫别人干活。”接着保安妻说：“家是您当的，您怎样说都行，那天推磨，你们谁推一圈啦？”说来说去，谁也不服谁。金安说：“你们说，你们心中整天都想啥吧，都要说真心话才行。”金安妻说：“我觉得反正过不好，才有事不商量，看看啥也不顺眼，谁也不让谁。”保安妻说：“我病的时候他们都麻烦我，我这会好了，想起来很伤心，做活也没劲。”这一下把事儿说透了，金安说：“你们这话要早说，不就解决了吗？以后遇事只要多商量。”保安妻说：“有事要能商量，自己人还有多大仇气，有话说到当面，谁也不再吵闹，家还是要二嫂当起来。”金安妻说：“不嫌我无用就中，大家商量好，我总得走到前边。”金安说：“以后分花分东西按人数平均”。大家都同意了。
    会后，全家人都认识到，只要开会话说明白就能办事，生产情绪十分高，三月初十又开了一次会，订了节约办法；过去每天用面四升，现在配菜做只用二升半，妯娌们住娘家，还是按规定办，不另吃好的。金安仍做买卖，兄弟们在家里做活，全家一团和气，过得比从前更有劲了。
