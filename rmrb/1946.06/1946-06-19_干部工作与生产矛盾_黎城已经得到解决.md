    The contradiction between cadre work and production in Licheng has been resolved.
    [This Dispatch from Changzhi] This year, in the production campaign in Licheng, the problem of the contradiction between the work of cadres and their own production has been studied, and preliminary solutions have been discussed. First, it should be recognized that helping and solving the production difficulties of cadres is one of the leadership's tasks. The production of cadres should be combined with their work to overcome the previous phenomenon of "whoever is active will be grabbed and not let go," which resulted in "whoever works actively does poorly in production." At the same time, the condescending view of taking care of cadres should be overcome, and efforts should be made to help them develop their own production. The specific methods are: first, to correct the ideological biases of cadres. For example, some cadres have a one-sided understanding that "to be for the masses, one should not be for oneself," and relax their own production. The leadership should educate cadres to recognize that being for the masses is also being for oneself, and to unify being responsible for work with taking care of their own family production. Those with family difficulties should be given labor and grain assistance. When cadres participate in mutual aid teams, the principle of equal value should be implemented fairly. Second, strengthen the education of cadres in serving the masses. Due to participating in work, some work delays are unavoidable. In work, attention should be paid to reducing the impact on production. One should not simply complain about work, complain about superiors, or become negative and pessimistic as a result. At the same time, those village cadres who use work as an excuse not to work should be persuaded to go into production, so that they understand that actively engaging in production is one of the criteria for a good cadre. Help village cadres arrange work, improve leadership, improve ability, reduce work delays, use collective leadership, division of labor and responsibility, and implement a duty system. For the leadership of scattered small mountain villages, strengthen the meetings with natural villages and reduce joint defense meetings to save time. This takes into account both production and the active role of cadres' work. Commend models who actively engage in production and lead the masses in production, and use concrete examples to promote everyone, so that everyone can learn to solve their own problems. In addition to organizing their family members to engage in production, some county and district cadres, due to the lack of labor in their families, can adopt a change in management methods, sell part of their land and invest in cooperatives for industrial and commercial production.

    干部工作与生产矛盾
    黎城已经得到解决
    【本报长治讯】黎城今年生产运动中，研究了各地干部工作与自己生产矛盾的问题，并讨论出初步解决方法。首先应认识帮助与解决干部的生产困难，是领导上的任务之一，把干部的生产与工作结合起来，克服已往“谁积极便抓住不放”，结果形成“谁积极工作，谁生产不好”的现象。同时克服照顾上的恩赐观点，从帮助他们发展自己的生产着手。其具体方法是首先要纠正干部的思想偏向。如某些干部有“为群众就不应为自己”的片面认识，放松自家的生产，领导上即教育干部认识为群众也是为自己，把对工作负责与照顾自己家庭生产统一起来，有家庭困难的，设法给以劳力及粮食的帮助，干部参加互助组应公平的执行等价政策。二、加强干部为群众服务的教育。由于参加工作误一部分工是不可免的，工作中应注意减少对生产的影响，不能单怨工作、怨上级，或因而消极悲观等，同时对村内有些干部借口工作而不事劳动，即应说服他到生产中去，使之了解积极生产是一个好干部的标准之一。帮助村干部安排工作，改进领导，提高能力，减少误工，运用集体领导、分工负责，实行值日制。对分散的小山庄的领导，采取加强自然庄的接头会，减少联防会，以节省时间，这样既照顾到生产，又发挥干部工作的积极性。表扬积极生产与领导群众生产的模范，用具体范例推动大家，使大家学习解决自己问题。一些县区干部除组织其家属生产外，有些因家庭缺乏劳力，可采取转变经营方式，卖出一部土地投资合作社进行工商业生产。
