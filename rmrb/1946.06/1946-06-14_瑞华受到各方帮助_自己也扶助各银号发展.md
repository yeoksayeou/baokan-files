Ruihua Receives Help From All Sides
Itself Also Assists the Development of Various Banks

According to the person in charge of Ruihua, in order to practice their business policy, they plan to use 30% of their funds to support rural credit undertakings and 30% to invest in industry and commerce. They set the lending rate at 0.2% daily interest, which is one-third lower than that of other banks. The interest rate for industrial loans can even be as low as 0.15%. He said: Initially, some banks suspected that Ruihua would overwhelm them, but in fact, this concern is unnecessary. As long as a bank's business is proper, we will definitely provide strong assistance to promote common development. We set the overdraft interest rate for banks at 0.15% daily, so they can earn double the interest when they lend it out. He said: Before our opening, banks had already borrowed about 10 million yuan from us. They have already obtained many benefits.

Ruihua, relying on its business policy of "serving the people" and "serving society," has already gained the trust of the general public. Capitalists and farmers are actively investing in shares. Manager Ma of the Shao Ming Coal Mine in Neiqiu independently subscribed to 5 million yuan worth of shares. Rural cooperatives in Changzhi and other places adopted a very good method: farmers want to buy shares, but cannot raise the funds in bulk at once, so they mobilize farmers to invest small amounts of money into the cooperative, and then the cooperative concentrates the funds to invest in Ruihua Bank. In the future, dividends will be distributed according to shares, and the cooperative will not charge any handling fees. Many former financiers have joined Ruihua, in addition to the general manager and deputy manager Hu Jing＠ and Wang Huafu, Zhang Wenhua, the managing director and director of the head office's business department, was the manager of the Weifeng Bank's Handan branch before the War of Resistance. Liu Zhuqiao, the supervisor of the Jining Flour Company before the War of Resistance, is now the supervisor of Ruihua Bank. Liu alone has invested 1 million shares.

In the Liberated Areas, with the support of the democratic government and the broad masses of the public, Ruihua's future is limitless.

### 瑞华受到各方帮助  自己也扶助各银号发展

    瑞华受到各方帮助
    自己也扶助各银号发展
    据瑞华的负责人说：他们为实践自己的营业方针，准备以百分之三十的资金扶植农村信用事业，百分之三十投资于工商业。他们把放款率定为日息二厘，较银号低三分之一。工业贷款的利率还可低到一厘五。他说：最初有些银号怀疑瑞华是否会把他们顶垮了，其实，这种顾虑是不必要的。只要银号的业务正当，我们一定大力帮助，以便共同发展。我们确定银号的透支利率为日息一厘五，他们再放出去就可以赚一倍利息。他说：在我们开幕以前，银号已向我们借了约一千万元。他们已经得到了许多的好处。
    瑞华凭着自己的“为人民服务”、“为社会服务”的营业方针，已经取得了广大社会人士的信任。资本家和农民都在踊跃入股。内邱邵明煤矿的马经理独自认股五百万元。长治等地的农村合作社采用了一个很好的办法：农民想入股，却一时凑不起成批的款子，他们发动农民把零星的款子入到合作社里，再由合作社集中起来入到瑞华银行，将来按股分息，合作社不收手续费。许多旧日的金融家参加瑞华工作，除了正副经理胡景＠、王化甫两氏之外，常务董事兼总行营业部主任张文华氏是抗战前蔚丰银行邯郸分行的经理，抗战前济宁面粉公司的监察人刘竹樵氏现在是瑞华银行的监察人，刘氏一人就入了一百万股金。
    在解放区，在民主政府和广大社会人士的支持下，瑞华的前途是无限量的。
