【Our Newspaper, Handan, 5th】 Since the Kuomintang representative of the Yongnian Executive Group entered Yongnian City, the puppet troops in the city had completed the construction of sixteen blockhouses before the 29th. After the 29th, five blockhouses were built in the North Gate and one in the South Gate. On the 1st of this month, piling began on the water surface outside the West Gate to erect barbed wire. On the 3rd, a unit of puppet troops sailed boats to conduct reconnaissance activities around our West Dam, constantly launching attacks, appearing to be preparing to attack our liberated areas outside the city. The puppet troops in the city continued to demolish civilian houses and accelerate the construction of the airport, claiming that once the airport was completed, a large number of bullets and cannons would be transported in.

Our military representative and the Yongnian City Relief Committee submitted a protest to the Executive Group representatives on the 3rd, demanding that the illegal actions of the puppet troops in the city, which violated the truce agreement, be stopped immediately. The protest letter from the Yongnian City Relief Committee also pointed out that since the US and Kuomintang representatives entered the city, not only has the suffering of the refugees in Yongnian City not been alleviated, but under the instruction of Kuomintang representative Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Chaozheng, more than one-third of the houses in the entire city have been demolished, leaving the people homeless and destitute. The puppet troops' harassment has intensified. The 250,000 people of Yongnian are extremely angry about this and demand that the Executive Group promptly request the Beiping Executive Headquarters to immediately disband the puppet troops and severely punish the traitors. Otherwise, the people of Yongnian will be forced to rise up and save themselves.

    永年伪军大修机场碉堡
    摧残人民不断向我出犯
    全县人民咸表愤怒，要求执行组解散伪军，否则将被迫奋起自救。
    【本报邯郸五日电】自永年执行小组国民党代表进入永年城后，城内伪军已于二十九日前修成炮楼十六个，二十九日以后，在北关修成炮楼五个，在南关修成一个，本月一日在西关外水面上开始打桩架设铁丝网，三日伪军一部驾船向我西大堤一带进行侦察活动，不断出击，有向我城外解放区进攻模样。城内伪军则继续拆毁民房，加紧修筑飞机场，扬言一旦飞机场修成，即有大批子弹枪炮运来。
    我驻军代表暨永年城关救济委员会，于三日向执行小组代表提出抗议，要求立即制止城内伪军此种违犯停战协定的不法举动。永年城关救济委员会抗议书中并指出：自国美双方代表进入城内，不但未解除永年城内难民任何痛苦，反在国方代表张朝正中校授意下，拆毁了全城三分之一以上的民房，使人民流宿街头无家可归，伪军出扰变本加厉，永年二十五万人民对此咸表极大愤怒，要求执行小组迅速呈请北平执行部立即解散伪军严惩汉奸，否则我永年人民必将被迫奋起自救。
