Xinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 11th. The Eighth Route Army in Eastern Hebei has recovered Anping Town, which belongs to Xianghe County. After the puppet army's security team occupied the town on the 26th of last month, they carried out extensive burning, killing, and looting in the vicinity, and forcibly requisitioned bricks, tiles, and wood to build碉堡 (diaobao - blockhouses/pillboxes). The people hated them to the core and requested the Eighth Route Army to expel the puppets. The local Eighth Route Army marched on the town at dawn on the 3rd of this month, and the battle ended victoriously that afternoon. It is estimated that more than 40 officers and soldiers, including the puppet battalion commander Feng Zhangqi, were killed, more than 1,000 puppet soldiers were wounded, and 73 puppet soldiers below the rank of company commander were captured. Six machine guns and more than 80 rifles were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianchang, 12th. The New Fourth Army in the eastern part of the Northern Anhui Liberated Area has achieved victories in self-defense. The 77th Division and 74th Division of the 75th Army, and the 58th Division of the 74th Army, of the Kuomintang army, with a total force of about five regiments, invaded the Lai'an and Liuhe Liberated Areas in three routes on the morning of the 7th, and captured Lai'an City, which was liberated from the enemy寇 (kou - bandits, a derogatory term for the Japanese) by the New Fourth Army last September, on the same day, and successively occupied more than ten market towns on the 7th and 8th. The New Fourth Army immediately gave resolute resistance. After fierce battles on the 9th and 10th, all the invading Kuomintang troops were routed, and more than ten places occupied on the 7th and 8th were recovered, including Babaiqiao, Xinhuangxiang, Zhongjiaji, Yuetangji, and Changxingji in the northeast of Liuhe, and Zhangjiaji and Zhangwangji in the northeast of Lai'an, such as Ma'anshan, Pingshan, and Huangni north of Liuhe.

Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 11th. The civil war launched by the Kuomintang army in the East China region has expanded from the Yangtze River coast, Northern and Southern Anhui to Shandong Province: (1) On the Southern Shandong border front, the 58th Army of the Kuomintang army, stationed in the vicinity of Suxian County south of Xuzhou, launched an attack on the counties of Xiao (County) and Tong (Shan) in the border area of Southern Anhui west of the Jinpu Railway on the 6th with a brigade force, occupying Shixiang Town, Yangzhuang Town, Laohaizhuang, QianChenzhuang, and HouChenzhuang. At noon on the same day, more than 700 Kuomintang troops from Zhensukou, Houji, and other areas east of Xuzhou were dispatched in two routes. One route occupied Yuanshan Town, ten miles east of Houji, and the other route occupied Lintong, twenty miles southeast of Xuzhou. The local Eighth Route Army rose up in self-defense and repelled the above-mentioned attacking forces on the evening of the 8th. At dawn on the 9th, Kuomintang troops returned with a vengeance, launching an attack on us from Jiawang, Houji, Damiao and other areas east of Xuzhou, and fierce fighting is underway. In addition, the Kuomintang troops stationed near Xuzhou have recently been shelling the Liberated Area on the edge of Weishan Lake from their artillery positions from time to time. (2) In the Jiaodong area, the Eighth Army of the Kuomintang army, in coordination with more than 1,200 puppet troops, launched an attack on the 8th from Xinzhuang to Tamin, near Linmi, on a ten-mile front. In addition, two other Kuomintang troops, one from Taibaozhuang (northwest of Ta'erbu) attacking the Sunjiazhuang area in the northeast; and the other attacking the Sunjiatun area northeast of Ta'erbu, were all repelled.
