    "I dare not go to Shimen again!"
    A Merchant's Accusation

    Zhang Jinsheng, who makes a living by doing small business, is from Zhang Village, Ningnan County. On May 4th, he went to Shijiazhuang to buy groceries. He was falsely accused of being a "Eighth Route Army soldier" and was severely tortured. Fortunately, with the help of fellow villagers who spent money to clear the way, he was able to escape. After returning home, he was deeply saddened by the fact that the Kuomintang treated Chinese people in this way, and he was extremely angry. He often told the masses about his experience. The following is a record:

    The Kuomintang's method of rule is the same as the Japanese devils'

    During the Japanese occupation of Shijiazhuang, ordinary people could not enter without a "Certificate of Good Citizenship." Sometimes, problems would arise, such as being accused of being a "Eighth Route Army soldier" and immediately detained. Therefore, for eight years, unless there was something urgent, I was reluctant to go to enemy-occupied cities. However, after the Kuomintang officials "took over Shimen," they established the Shimen Municipal Police Department in the same way, and printed "Certificates of Good Citizenship" that were exactly the same. It was necessary to carry them when entering and leaving, and it was the same if you didn't have one. What is most shameful is that the "Certificates of Good Citizenship" from the Japanese period are now universally applicable. So, the "good citizens" of Japan are the "good citizens" of the Kuomintang! The dignified Kuomintang actually copied the Japanese devils' set of methods for ruling the people.

    Secret agents run rampant, whoever has money suffers

    On May 4th, I set off from home, carrying a cash-carrying permit from the democratic government and 100 yuan of Jicha banknotes, and 150,000 yuan of counterfeit banknotes, to Shimen to purchase goods. I passed through the sentry post and was carefully checked, and they looked at the Certificate of Good Citizenship issued during the Japanese period. I stayed in a store that night, and suddenly several secret agents came to check the store, ostensibly to "check for bad people." Zhang Jinsheng believed that the appropriation certificate was issued by the democratic government, and the Jinan banknotes were anti-Japanese banknotes, so there was no need to be on guard. However, after the secret agents discovered them, they slammed the table in anger and said angrily, "You are from the Eighth Route Army." They immediately tied his arms tightly with rope. In the dark night, I don't know where he was taken. After a while, he was "interrogated," and they immediately asked, "Which part of the Eighth Route Army are you from? What are you doing here?" Zhang was originally a businessman, so he replied that he was here to buy goods. The secret agents angrily said, "You still don't admit it at this time, you must be punished." Then they brought a pole and placed bricks on the ground, forced him to kneel down, and began to torture him. Zhang had been doing business for many years, and he couldn't stand the torture. Moreover, one secret agent was inducing him from the side, "I am also from the Eighth Route Army, admit it! Nothing will happen, and now I am still working!" Zhang had no choice but to admit that he was from the county brigade, and temporarily made up the false names of two captains. Zhang often went out to run business, so where would he know these things? But the secret agent said that he had come to Shimen to scout, and repeatedly threatened him, saying that if he did not admit it, he would not live to see the light of day with this cash-carrying permit and Jinan banknotes.

    Seven thousand yuan in legal tender, forty packages of colors to redeem him

    The next day, after many people were asked to intercede and the Fuxinglong store provided a guarantee, a total of seven thousand yuan in legal tender and forty packages of colors were spent to redeem him from the gates of hell. When he was about to leave, the secret agent said, "You are a good citizen, why did you admit it last night?" Zhang replied, "I couldn't bear the torture, so I had to talk nonsense." The secret agent raised his wooden stick and kept saying, "I told you to talk nonsense, I told you to talk nonsense," hitting him. Zhang's fingers were bleeding, and this was the last beating.

    The Kuomintang is like this, I am too scared to go to Shimen again

    Zhang Jinsheng returned home in a mess. Not only did he fail to buy goods, but he also lost money. That's not all, the most painful thing is that his arms, legs, and fingers are broken, and he is covered in scars, and the pain is unbearable. He often points to the wounds and says to others, "This is the 'grace' and 'freedom' that the Kuomintang gives to merchants. The Kuomintang is like this, I am too scared to go to Shimen again."

### “再也不敢去石门了”  一个商人的控诉

    “再也不敢去石门了”
    一个商人的控诉
    专靠做小买卖为生的张金声，系宁南县张庄人，于五月四日赴石家庄买杂货，因被诬为“八路”，遭严刑拷打，幸经同乡多方托人花钱运通才得脱险。回家后，痛感国民党竟如此对待国人，愤恨异常，经常向群众叙说，遭事经过，兹录于下：
    国民党和鬼子统治办法一样
    石家庄在日本统治时期，老百姓没有“良民证”是不能进去的。有时还要闹出乱子，如说你是“八路”，马上就扣起来。因此八年来除非有要紧的事情，我不愿轻易到敌占城市里去。可是国民党的大员“接收石门”后，同样的建立了石门市警察厅，一模一样的印制了“良民证”，出进必须配带，没有，同样也是不行。最可耻的是日本时期的“良民证”现在一律适用。原来日本的“良民”就是国民党的“良民”！堂堂国民党竟抄袭了鬼子的一套统治人民的办法。
    特务横行，谁有钱就遭殃
    五月四日由家动身，带着民主政府的携款证及冀钞一百元，伪钞十五万，到石门去办货，路经岗哨同样检查了个仔细，看了日本时期发的良民证。晚上宿在店里，突有特务数人前来查店，名为“检查坏人”，张金生认为拨款证是民主政府开的，冀南票是抗日钞，正大光明，何必戒备，但特务发觉后，却拍案大怒，气冲冲的说：“你是八路的”，随即将他两只膀臂用绳子紧紧捆起，黑夜里，也不知是被牵到了什么地方，一会儿“审讯”了，开口便问：“你是八路那一部分，来这里干什么”？张本系商人，即以来此买货相答，特务们恼怒的说：“到了这个时候你还不承认，非治不可”，随即拿来了杠子，地下放好了砖，逼他跪下开始动刑。张某常年经商，那里经得起拷打，何况有一特务从旁进行引诱：“我也是八路，承认！啥事没有，现在还作了事！”张某只好承认是县大队，并临时编了两个队长的假名，张某经常外出跑商，这些事那里知道呢？但特务却说出来石门侦探的，屡次恐吓，就是不承认，有这携款证和冀南票，也活不到明。
    七千元法币，四十包颜色赎出来
    第二天经过多方的托人运通，并有复兴隆商店担保，共花了七千元法币，四十包颜色，才由阎王殿里赎出来。在出门的时候，特务却说：“你是良民昨夜为啥承认？”张答：“我受刑不过只得胡说。”特务又举起来木棒连说：“我叫你胡说，我叫你胡说”的打着，张某手指开了花，鲜血迸流着，这是最后的一场毒打。
    国民党原来这样，吓死我也不敢再去石门
    张金声狼狈的回到家，货不但没有办，而且亏了本。这还不算，最痛心的是臂腿，手指都破裂了，遍身伤痕，疼痛难忍，不时的指着伤处对别人说：“这是国民党给予商人的‘恩施’，‘自由’。国民党原来这样，吓死我也不敢再去石门了。”
