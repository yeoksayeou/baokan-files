Taihang Third Special District Administrative Office
Issues Cotton Field Management Measures

[This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] The Taihang Third Special District Administrative Office, based on the current symptoms occurring in cotton fields, has issued the following instructions on cotton field management: (1) Seedlings not growing – the reason is that there was more rain this spring and the climate was cold, and early frost damaged the seedlings, preventing them from growing. Management methods should include weeding, loosening the soil, and breaking up the clods to make the surface soil loose so that it can absorb more sunlight, and the seedlings will gradually flourish. (2) Seedling death – this is caused by a parasitic bacterium. When first discovered, the seedlings are weak and yellow, or even dead. Sprinkle some lime around the seedlings (not too much) and hoe it in to prevent it. This bacterium occurs more often in acidic soils; using lime neutralizes the acidity and the bacterium can be eliminated. (3) Pest control – the most serious pest is the cutworm. The preventive measure is to diligently weed and hoe, preferably after each rain. Do not hoe too deeply, and always keep the soil surface loose to prevent ants from passing by. Because ants and cutworms have a symbiotic relationship. If cutworms have already occurred, spray with tobacco water. The next pest is the red spider mite, which parasites on the underside of cotton leaves, sucking the leaf sap, which harms the growth of cotton seedlings and causes great damage. The treatment is to clean the cotton fields and remove diseased plants, or spray with cotton oil emulsion. Organizing women and children to diligently catch pests is the basic way to prevent the spread of pests. (4) Thinning – In the old liberated areas, cotton seeds are scarce, so small seedlings are generally spot-sown, resulting in very crowded conditions. Also, because the seedlings are small, thinning is delayed, which affects the development of the cotton plants. Now that it is the wheat harvest season, the climate is warm, and the cotton seedlings will grow quickly. Thinning should be done quickly to leave only one strong seedling per spot, or two or three seedlings (but one must be thinned to a single seedling before the cotton plant has six leaves) without affecting the growth of the cotton plant. The remaining seedlings should be staggered between rows (following the principle of breaking the rows) to facilitate the development of the cotton plant into a round shape, which can produce more cotton bolls. In addition, because it has been cold this year, areas with missing seedlings should be replanted with sesame, soybeans, etc., to increase the harvest.

    太行三专署
    发布棉田管理办法
    【本报长治讯】太行三专署顷根据目前棉田发生的病象，指示棉田管理办法如下：（一）幼苗不长——原因是今春雨多，气候寒冷，早霜损害幼苗，不能成长，管理方法应锄去杂草，锄松地皮，打碎土块，使地面土皮成流和状，能多吸收阳光，幼苗即可逐渐茂盛。（二）幼苗枯死——此系一种寄生病菌所致，初发现时幼苗柔弱发黄，甚或枯死，在苗的周围撒些石灰（不要过多），锄一下可以防止。这种菌多发生于酸性土壤，使用石灰以碱性中和，病菌可以消灭。（三）防止虫害——最严重的是油旱虫，预防法应当勤锄拔草，最好下一次雨锄一遍，锄时不要过深，应经常保持土面疏松，以防止马蚁走过。因为马蚁和油旱起共生作用，如油旱已经发生，可以使用烟叶水喷杀。其次是红蜘蛛，这东西是寄生在棉花叶子下面，吸食叶汁，防害棉苗生长，为害很大。治法以清洁棉田和拔除病株，或使用棉油乳剂喷射。组织妇女儿童，勤捉害虫是防止害虫蔓延的基本办法。（四）间苗——老区种棉因种籽缺乏，一般都是点播小苗，非常拥挤。又因苗小，迟迟不间，影响棉株发育。现在麦收季节，气候暖和，棉苗将很快生长，应当急速定清只留一株健苗，或留二、三株，（但在棉花六个叶以前，一定要清留一株）不影响棉株生长。定株与行的中间，最好错开（要照破行留），便于棉株发展成圆形，可以多结桃。另外因为今年天冷，有缺苗的须补种芝麻、黄豆等，以增加收获。
