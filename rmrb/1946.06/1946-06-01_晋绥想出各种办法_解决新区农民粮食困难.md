Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 28th. Jin-Sui is using various methods to solve the food shortages of poor people during the lean season. In the newly liberated areas of Fenyang, Xiaoyi, Lishi, and other places, some difficulties are being solved by carrying out land rent reduction and liquidation. In Sun ×× village, Xiaoyi, the masses liquidated Zhao Lunren, the pseudo-head of the village, for extorting and embezzling 75 shi of grain. After leaving 15 shi for his own consumption, the rest was distributed to more than 50 poor households in the village. In Lishi, the masses liquidated Wang Zigang, a landlord, for embezzling 32 shi of Yicang grain and community land rent, which was issued to families of soldiers and the poor, and the whole village was organized to plant autumn fields. Linxian's seventh district suffered severe drought and locust plagues last year, and many people are currently short of food. The district's villages are using four methods to solve the food shortage for poor households: grasping rent reduction, sorting out Yicang grain and money, launching mutual assistance, and organizing women to spin and weave. In JingLe, ensuring spring borrowing and autumn repayment, mobilizing wealthy households to voluntarily lend surplus grain, JichizhuYu, Shijiazhuang and other six villages lent a total of 17 shi of grain, solving the seed and food difficulties of 80 poor households. The government's seedling loans are all used to solve the difficulties of poor people.
