    Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 1st. The heroic defense of Shengfang City, an important town in northern Hebei Province, has entered its seventh day. Our army continues to hold its original positions, repelling the invading army's fierce attacks. On the 25th of last month, the Kuomintang army concentrated seven battalions (six battalions from the 121st Division and one battalion from the 129th Regiment of the 43rd Division), supported by heavy weapons such as airplanes and tanks, and launched a three-pronged attack on Shengfang City. On the 25th and 26th, they fired over a thousand shells and launched more than ten assaults, all of which were repelled. On the evening of the 26th, the invading army adopted a strategy of focused attacks and briefly penetrated two bunkers on the east side, but were immediately repelled by the defenders' valiant counterattack, resulting in the annihilation of one of their platoons. At 9:00 PM, 12:00 AM, and 3:00 AM on the 27th, the invading army launched three more fierce attacks, all of which were crushed. On the 28th, some war-weary soldiers took advantage of the lull in the fighting to escape and defected to the Eighth Route Army, numbering more than ten. According to them, the Kuomintang army has suffered over 600 casualties in the unjust battle to attack Shengfang, and one tank was destroyed. All regimental and battalion-level cadres of the 129th Regiment of their 43rd Division, with the exception of one company commander, have been killed or wounded. The commander of their 362nd Regiment cried and said, "I have never suffered such great losses in all these years." The invaders are currently awaiting reinforcements before attacking again. Shengfang City is located less than 100 li west of Tianjin and is a vital land and water route connecting the Hebei-Central Liberated Area to Tianjin. It is a prosperous commercial center and a crucial military and economic location.

    进犯军屡次猛攻均被击退
    战斗一周进犯军伤亡六百余
    【新华社河间一日电】冀中北部重要市镇胜芳市之英勇保卫战，已进入第七天，我军仍坚守原阵地，击退进犯军之猛烈进攻。上月二十五日，国民党军集中七个营（一二一师六个营，四十三师一二九团一个营）兵力，配合飞机坦克等重武器，分三路向胜芳市猛攻，二十五、二十六两日，发炮千余发，冲锋十余次，均被击退。二十六日晚，进犯军采取重点攻击，曾一度楔入东面两个碉堡，但立即被守军勇猛击退，并歼灭其一个排。二十七日晚九时、十二时及二十八日晨三时，进犯军又三次猛攻，均被击溃。二十八日，部份厌战士兵，乘战况沉寂时逃出，向八路军投诚者十余名。据彼等谈：国民党军在进攻胜芳之不义战斗中，已伤亡六百余名，坦克一辆被毁，其四十三师一二九团团营干部除一个连长外，均告伤亡。其三六二团团长大哭地说：“几年来从未受过这样大的损失。”现进犯者正等待增援再犯中。按胜芳市位于天津西不足百里，为冀中解放区通达天津之水陆要道，商业繁盛，为军事经济要地。
