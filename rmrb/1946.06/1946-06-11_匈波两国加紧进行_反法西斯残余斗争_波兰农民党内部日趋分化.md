Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th. Recently, Hungary and Poland have been intensifying the struggle against "anti-democratic" and anti-fascist remnants. The Hungarian Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, the National Peasant Party, and the Trade Union Council recently held a meeting in Kaposvár and issued a declaration announcing that the left-wing group organized an executive committee in March 1946, urging the elimination of fascist remnants in order to accelerate the development of democracy. Not long ago, the Hungarian political police discovered a reactionary underground organization in Budapest, and several members of the organization have been arrested. On the eve of the referendum on June 30, the Polish Peasant Party is increasingly divided. The meeting of the party in the Jędrzejów district decided to hold an emergency demonstration to oppose the party leader and his policies. The meeting also passed a resolution condemning the policies of the Polish Peasant Party headed by Mikołajczyk, pointing out that Mikołajczyk refused to unite with the democratic forces in Poland and contacted reactionary underground organizations and the National Armed Forces, becoming a fortress of all landlords and capitalists forces at home and abroad. The resolution called on all truly democratic and patriotic people to unite and vote in favor of the Polish referendum. The Polish security authorities also sealed off four offices of the Polish Peasant Party, prohibiting them from any activities, because these local organizations carried out activities against the unanimous government and tried to subvert the country's democratic status quo. At the same time, the secret police searched the headquarters of the "National Party" in the Sandomierz district and discovered a new anti-government underground organization. This organization, under the instructions of "London," attacked democratic leaders. Twenty-seven people have been arrested, and a large number of weapons and radio stations have been seized.
