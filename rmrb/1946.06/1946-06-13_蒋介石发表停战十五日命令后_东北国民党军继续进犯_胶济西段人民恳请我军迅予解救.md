Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, Jilin-Liaoning, Urgent Telegram, 8th (Delayed): After Chiang Kai-shek issued an order for a fifteen-day ceasefire in the Northeast, the 14th Division of the Kuomintang New 8th Army, after occupying Yongji, continued to attack the Democratic Allied Forces in Jiaohe, over a hundred li east of Yongji, with intense firepower on the afternoon of the 7th.

Xinhua News Agency, Boshan, 10th: On the Jiaoji Railway line, the people of nearly a hundred villages around Zhangdian and Zhoucun, including Dongxi Guantun, Shandi’anzhuang, Gaojia Zhuang, and Tangjia Zhuang, jointly implore the Lubei Administrative Office and the Lubei Military Region to rescue them swiftly and disband the puppet troops of Zhang Jingyue, Zhou Shengfang, Cheng Xuetong, Wang Lian, and others, as they cannot bear the atrocities of the puppet troops. They bitterly accused the puppet troops of their atrocities, stating: The puppet troops, entrenched in Lishui Village, brutally killed over a hundred people, including over thirty family members of resistance fighters. The bodies of fifty-odd victims have already been found. Furthermore, over one hundred and sixty cadres and militiamen in Wangshang Village, Zichuan, were killed. The puppet troops in Zhangdian and Zhoucun launched a total of eleven attacks on the Eighth Route Army in late May, employing over three thousand eight hundred troops, burning, killing, and looting everywhere. In the three villages of Gaojia Zhuang, Tangjia Zhuang, and others alone, twelve civilians were killed, nine were wounded, over twenty were captured, and over nine thousand one hundred jin of grain were looted.
