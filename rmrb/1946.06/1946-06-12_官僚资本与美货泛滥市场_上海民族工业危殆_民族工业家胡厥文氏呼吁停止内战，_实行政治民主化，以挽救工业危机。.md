Xinhua News Agency, Rugao, 9th: Due to the Kuomintang's bureaucratic capital rule and oppression, and the endless dumping of American goods, Shanghai's national capital industries are suffering severely. In terms of bureaucratic capital, the "China Textile Construction Company" controls the silk weaving industry, possessing one million spindles, accounting for half of all spindles in Shanghai. The "Fuel Committee," organized by Song Ziwen, controls coal. The "China Import and Export Trading Company," organized by Song Ziwen's brother, Song Ziliang, as well as Song Ziwen's Jinshan Company and Lida Company, and the "Yangtze Construction Company," organized by Kong Xiangxi's son, Kong Lingjue, control import and export trade. Seventeen major rice merchants handling "rice loans" for the Farmers Bank control grain. Because "China Import and Export Trading Company" and "Yangtze Construction Company" have large amounts of American dollars deposited in the United States by Kong and Song, the two companies only need to send a telegram to the United States or transfer an account through the Bank of China to obtain large amounts of American dollars, a privilege not available to private capital. At the same time, large quantities of American goods have arrived in Shanghai. American cotton alone, from November of last year to April of this year, has reached 650,000 dan, causing panic among Shanghai industrialists. It is reported that the shipment of all American goods requires the mobilization of all cranes in Shanghai for more than three months. Everything from food, clothing, daily necessities, light industrial machinery, and the latest American goods are available. Due to the Kuomintang authorities' support for bureaucratic capital and unlimited encouragement of foreign goods imports, the exchange rate has consistently remained low at around 2,000 yuan, a hundred times higher than before the war, while Chinese prices have risen 3,500 times compared to before the war. Therefore, even though American goods shipped to Shanghai are taxed at 20%, they can still generate profits of two to ten times or more, and their prices are still lower than Chinese goods. For example, an eight-foot lathe, American-made with pure steel streamlined design and equipped with an electric fan, only costs 2.4 million yuan in legal tender, while a simple Chinese-made lathe costs over 10 million yuan. Cotton in Shanghai costs 100,000 yuan per dan, while American top-quality middling cotton only costs 900 yuan per dan. One pound of American-made milk costs 2,000 yuan, enough to last a month, while Chinese milk costs 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Therefore, speculative capital floods the market, competing to sell American goods and fostering the growth of comprador capital. Chinese products, due to their high prices, are ignored. Chinese products in overseas markets are also squeezed out by large quantities of foreign goods and bureaucratic capital, making it impossible to sell them.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: Shanghai United Evening News reported on May 28th: Hu Juewen, chairman of the Association of Relocated Factory Owners in Sichuan, told the newspaper that the industrial sector is currently suffering. During the Anti-Japanese War, more than 300 factories relocated to Sichuan, experiencing displacement and suffering heavy losses, with losses in the Xiang and Gui areas alone amounting to 3.2 million yuan. After the victory, the government only allowed a subsidy of 1% (i.e., 40,000 yuan). Currently, due to economic difficulties, only a small portion of the factories have relocated back, and most of the original factory sites have been damaged and cannot be restored. Factories remaining in Sichuan mostly sell their machinery to survive, exhausted and in dire straits. Hu cited his own Xinmin, Hezuo, and Tianzhong factories as examples. The factories worked hard to relocate inland during the Anti-Japanese War, losing one-third of their machinery, but still tried their best to manufacture ammunition for the government, accounting for one-half of the output of private factories. After the victory, the government did not provide assistance for their recovery, and now he has returned to Shanghai empty-handed, unable to restore his factories. Hu then said with emotion: "I have been running factories for 30 years and have never encountered so many difficulties. I endured all kinds of hardships during the Anti-Japanese War, but I always had a goal – for victory, so I still had the courage to overcome all difficulties. Now, I feel that eight years of hard work have been completely wasted, and the suffering has been in vain." Finally, Hu put forward the current industrial sector's sincere hope: "Only the civil war can be stopped quickly. China, which has suffered for so many years, has a weak industrial base that is about to disappear. If the civil war continues, this foundation will be completely wiped out. Only by not fighting a civil war and implementing political democratization can we talk about economic democracy and industrialization."

    上海民族工业危殆
    民族工业家胡厥文氏呼吁停止内战，
    实行政治民主化，以挽救工业危机。
    【新华社如皋九日电】由于国民党的官僚资本的统治与压迫，大批美货无止境倾销，致上海民族资本工业遭受严重打击。官僚资本方面，操纵丝织业的有“中国纺织建设公司”，拥有纱锭一百万个，占上海纱锭全数之半。统治煤的，有宋子文主办的“燃料委员会”。操纵进出口贸易的，有宋子文之弟宋子良所主办的“中国进出口贸易公司”，以及宋子文的金山公司、立达公司，与孔祥熙之子孔令觉主办之“扬子建业公司”，操纵粮食的有向农民银行承办“米贷”的十七个大米商。“中国进出口贸易公司”与“扬子建业公司”，因有孔宋等大批美金存在美国，二公司只须向美国发一电报或向中国银行转一笔账，即可获得大批美金，而民有资本则无此特权。同时，大批美货已运抵上海，单美棉自去年十一月至今年四月，已运达六十五万担，上海一般工业家对此已感恐慌。据悉：全部美货的起运，须动员全上海起重机搬三个月以上，举凡吃穿日用品、轻工业机器、最新式的美式洋货，应有尽有。由于国民党当局对官僚资本的支持，无限度鼓励外货进口，外汇始终保持二千元左右的低额汇率，较战前涨一百倍，而中国物价已较战前上涨三千五百倍，故美货运沪虽报百分之二十的税，但仍有二倍到十倍以上的利润可图，价格仍较中国货物低廉。例如一部八尺车床，美式为纯钢流线型，装有电风扇，只须二百四十万元法币，而一部中国厂造，设备简单之车床，须一千万元以上。棉花在上海须十万元法币一担，而美国上等米米特林棉，只须九百元法币一担。一磅美制牛奶二千元，可吃一个月，中国牛奶竟须一万元至两万元。因此，游资泛滥市场，竞相推销美货，助长买办资本成长。中国产品因价格过高，无人过问。中国产品在海外市场，亦受大批外货与官僚资本排挤，无法推销。
    【新华社延安九日电】沪联合晚报五月二十八日载：民族工业家迁川工厂联合会理事长胡厥文对该报记者谈目前工业界的苦闷称：抗战期间，迁川工厂三百余家，辗转流离，损失惨重，仅在湘桂一带即损失三百二十万万元。胜利后，政府只允补助百分之一（即四万万元），现各厂因经济困难，只迁回一小部分，而原厂址多已毁损，无法复员。留川工厂则多变卖机器维持，精疲力竭，情况至惨。胡氏并举其所办之新民、合作、天中三厂为例，该厂于抗战中辛苦内迁，机器损失三分之一，然犹竭力为政府制造军火，占民营工厂出产量二分之一。胜利后，政府并未予以帮助复员，至今一人光身回沪，无法复员。胡氏继又感慨地说：“我办了三十年工厂，从没有碰到这么多困难，在抗战中什么苦也吃够了，总有一个目标，为了胜利，所以还有勇气战胜一切困难。现在感到八年的心血完全白花，苦也白吃了”。最后胡氏提出目前工业界赤忱希望称：“只有内战快些停止，多年来的苦难中国，这一点薄弱的工业基础，已经快消灭了，再打内战，这点基础就更扫荡无存。只有不打内战，政治民主化，才谈得到经济民主，才谈得到工业化”。
