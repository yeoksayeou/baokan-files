    Longyuan Oil Factory Transitions to Private Ownership: Several Problems Need Solving
    Our Newspaper Interview
    [Our Newspaper Interview] A few days ago, the reporter met Manager Fang Zhenyuan of the Longyuan Oil Factory. At that time, prices were fluctuating, and we took the opportunity to talk about the oil price problem. He said, "My oil will be at least five percent lower than the market price. Now cottonseed oil sells for 95 yuan on the market, but mine only sells for 80 yuan."

    On the 8th, I went to Longyuan to explore the secret of this low price.

    We visited this semi-mechanized, semi-handicraft factory. It has a 25-horsepower engine, an extraction machine, and a considerable number of cotton ginning machines. Now that cotton has not yet entered the market, the ginning machines are idle. The oil presses are in operation, producing 1,000 catties of flaxseed oil, or more than 900 catties of rapeseed oil, and more than 600 catties of cottonseed oil per day.

    This is a factory transferred from government to private ownership. Its predecessor was the Qinyi Oil Factory, jointly operated by a group of private individuals in the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935). After the Incident (likely referring to the Marco Polo Bridge Incident), it was forcibly occupied by the enemy and renamed the Ji'an Factory. Soon after, some major shareholders of the original Qinyi Oil Factory cooperated with the enemy to form the Ri'an Company. The enemy invested 300,000 yuan to expand operations, and the manager was Japanese, specializing in pressing cotton for the enemy. After the liberation of Handan, the factory was taken over by the government, which invested 1.5 million yuan to repair the buildings and add furniture, and quickly resumed operations. All thirty-one workers and fourteen staff members were thus re-employed. Later, in order to develop private business, the government auctioned the enemy's portion of the factory for more than 4 million yuan to five shareholders including Wufutang and Yang Dianfa. Another portion of the share capital, 1.2 million yuan, is temporarily managed by the government, pending the completion of procedures for returning it to the old shareholders.

    It is really not easy to run such an oil factory at this time. According to old customs, oil factories mostly close down in the fifth, sixth, and seventh months of the lunar calendar because of a shortage of raw materials at this time. The enemy used this factory to press cotton, but now that cotton has not yet come onto the market, and the original Qinyi Oil Factory only pressed cottonseed oil, there is now a shortage of cottonseed. Manager Fang and his colleagues are trying every means to change to producing hemp oil and rapeseed oil so as to avoid workers having to stop working. Hemp oil can be used as machine oil and is also an indispensable raw material for making soap, which chemical plants desperately need.

    Manager Fang said: The workers' lives have improved a lot. Not to mention the political improvement and spiritual liberation, just in terms of material life, each person's average monthly wage is 160-170 catties of millet. The factory also provides meals, with each person getting one and a half catties of white flour, twelve taels of millet, and ten yuan for vegetables per day. In addition, the factory also provides work clothes, towels, and hair-cutting fees. The working day is nine hours. The workers' morale is very good.

    However, he said: There are currently several problems facing us. The first is the difficulty in selling products. Before the war, most of the factory's oil products were sold in Tianjin, Beijing, and Hankou, and the factory could make money. Now that the Kuomintang has launched a civil war and is blockading our liberated areas, the products cannot be shipped out. They are planning to buy some large carts themselves to sell the stored oil in the most expensive places. Second, as goods cannot be sold quickly for the time being and workers' wages have increased, production should theoretically be increased in order to reduce costs and sell at low prices locally as much as possible. However, the workers' working hours are now shorter, and each person's average output is no more than that of rural hand-operated oil presses. Those oil press workers mostly produce and sell themselves, with very little overhead, while setting up a factory specifically entails higher overhead. Today, improving workers' lives is essential, but workers should be educated in various ways to appropriately extend working hours and greatly increase production, so that the factory can make more money, and the workers' jobs will have a solid guarantee. Full labor-management cooperation should be the urgent need in the current transitional stage. Third, the factory currently does not press cotton, and the power is not being fully utilized (only five or six horsepower are being used now). It seems that ways should be found to engage in other side businesses. Factory management also needs to be more scientific in order to reduce expenses, lower costs, and increase output and quality as much as possible, so that both labor and management can make more money.

    隆源油厂转为私营
    几个问题需要解决
    本报专访
    【本报专访】前几天，记者遇到隆源油厂的方振远经理。那时候物价正在跳动，我们乘便谈起油价问题。他说：“我的油至少要比市价低百分之五。现在市上的棉籽油卖九十五元，我的只卖八十元。”
    八日，我去隆源探索这种贱价的秘密。
    我们参观这个半机器半手工业的工厂。它有一座二十五匹马力的发动机，一座榨抽机和相当数量的榨花机。现在棉花尚未上市，榨花机在停顿着。榨油机在开工。一天能产一千斤麻子油，或九百多斤菜子油，六百多斤棉籽油。
    这是一个由政府转让给私人的工厂。它的前身是民国二十四年由一部分私人合伙经营的勤益油厂。事变后被敌寇强占，易名为吉安工厂，不久，原勤益油厂一些大股东与敌人合作组成日安公司，敌人投资三十万元扩大经营，经理是日本人，专给敌人榨棉花。邯郸解放后，该厂为政府接收，投资一百五十万元，修补房子，添置家具，很快的开了工。三十一个工人，十四个职员因而全部复业。以后，政府为发展私人营业，将该厂敌人部分以四百余万元拍卖给五福堂、杨殿发等五家股东，另一部股本一百二十万元由政府暂时代管，准备于清理手续后，发还给旧股东。
    现时经营这么个油厂也真不容易。按照旧习惯，油厂多于阴历五、六、七月休业，因为这个时候原料缺乏。敌人用这个厂子榨花，现在棉花未下来，原勤益油厂只榨棉花油，现在又缺乏棉籽。方经理他们为了不使工人休业，多方想法改制大麻油和菜子油。大麻油可充机械油，又为制造肥皂不可缺的原料，化学厂极需要它。
    方经理说：工人的生活改善多了，政治上的提高，精神上的解放自不必说，单说物质生活，每人每月平均工资一六○——一七○斤小米，厂方还管饭吃，每人每天一斤半白面、十二两小米、十元菜金。另外厂方还发工衣、毛巾及理发费等。每天工作九小时。工人情绪是很好的。
    但是，他说：目前已经有几个问题摆在眼前了。第一是产品销路困难。抗战前厂里的油类大部行销平津、汉口，厂方可以赚钱。现在国民党发动内战，对我解放区又实行封锁，产品不能运出去，他们准备自己买些大车，把存油运到最贵的地方去卖。第二、货物一时不能畅销，工人工资又增加了，照理应该增加产量，以便减低成本，尽量在本地贱价兜售。可是现在工人的工作时间较短，每人平均产量并不比农村手工榨油工人多，那些榨油工人多半自制自卖，开支甚小，而专门设厂则开支较大。今天改善工人生活是必须的，但应多方教育工人，设法适当的延长工作时间，大大提高产量，使厂方多赚些钱，工人的职业也就有了坚实的保障。劳资充分合作当为目前过渡阶段的急要之图。第三、该厂目前不榨花，动力未能充分利用（现在只用五六匹马力），似应设法兼营其他副业。工厂管理也有更加科学化的必要。以便尽量减少开支，压低成本，提高产量和质量，使劳资双方都多赚些钱。
