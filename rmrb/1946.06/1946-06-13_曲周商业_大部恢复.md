    Quzhou Commerce
    Largely Recovered
    [Our Weixian Dispatch] Quzhou's commerce, which was almost entirely destroyed by the enemy, has largely recovered since our army liberated it last autumn, with the support of the democratic government. Newly opened establishments include the Limin Towel Factory, department stores, coal stores, grain stores, and more than ten restaurants. Small vendors have also all resumed business. The main street, which stretches more than three miles from Hedong to the east side of the city, is crowded with merchants. Currently, various stores are actively expanding their businesses.

    曲周商业
    大部恢复
    【本报威县讯】被敌人摧残殆尽的曲周商业，自去秋为我军解放后，在民主政府扶植下，原有工商业大部恢复。新开的，有利民毛巾工厂，百货商店，磁炭店，粮店，饭馆亦有十余家，小商贩也都全部恢业。由河东至城内东街三里多长的大街挤满了来往客商。现各商店积极扩大营业。
