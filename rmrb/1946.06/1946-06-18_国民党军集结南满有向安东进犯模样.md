    Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 15th: Amidst the ceasefire calls in the Northeast, the Kuomintang is massing heavy troops in southeastern Manchuria, appearing to be launching a large-scale offensive against Andong. The Kuomintang troops on the Andong-Fengtian (Shenyang) line are advancing along the railway towards Qiaotouzhen, 20 miles south of Benxi, which is under our control. Furthermore, a large number of troops are also gathering between Haicheng and Dashiqiao, preparing to invade eastward. In coordination with their large-scale military offensive on various fronts, Kuomintang aircraft have also been continuously strafing and bombing everywhere in recent days. On the 13th, two Kuomintang aircraft bombed and strafed Tonghua. On the 12th, Kuomintang aircraft bombed Shanchengzhen (about 20 miles southwest of Meihekou), causing casualties among the masses, with four people injured or killed.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: TASS, Moscow, 14th: TASS refutes rumors. The Central Daily News, the central organ of the Chinese Kuomintang, published a news item from Peiping stating that a unit of Soviet troops was supposedly still stationed in Harbin. TASS is authorized to declare that this news is completely untrue. As everyone knows, according to the notification published on May 22, 1946, the Soviet army completed its withdrawal from Manchuria on May 3.

    国民党军集结南满有向安东进犯模样
    【新华社安东十五日电】在东北停战声中，国民党在东南满集结重兵，有向安东大举进犯模样。安奉线之国民党军，正沿铁路向本溪以南二十里我之桥头镇进攻。另在海城大石桥间，亦集结大兵，准备向东侵犯。配合其在各线之大规模军事进攻，国民党飞机近日亦不断到处扫射轰炸。十三日国民党飞机两架，在我通化投弹并扫射。而十二日国民党飞机在轰炸我山城镇（梅河口西南二十余里）时，曾伤亡群众四人。
    【新华社延安十五日电】塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：塔斯社辟谣，中国国民党中央机关报中央日报，登载北平消息谓：在哈尔滨据说还留有一部苏军。塔斯社奉命声明，这一消息完全不符事实。大家知道，一九四六年五月二十二日公布的通知，苏军于五月三日，已完成从满洲之撤退工作。
