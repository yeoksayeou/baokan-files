Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Moscow dispatch: *Pravda's* international observer writes: British Foreign Secretary Bevin, in his speech in the House of Commons, insisted on the attitude maintained by the British delegation at the Paris Conference, but this did not prevent Bevin from expressing the desire that when the Soviet delegation returns to Paris, it should be prepared to accept the Anglo-American suggestions on the conclusion of the Austrian peace treaty, the Italian-Yugoslav border, the former Italian colonies, Italian reparations, and the navigation of the Danube. Bevin said: "I believe that if this is done, it will be the best evidence of trust and mutual understanding throughout the year." But why does Bevin equate a concession in one area with trust and mutual understanding in other areas? True trust and genuine mutual understanding are not the same as demanding unilateral concessions. In negotiations between equal powers, such a desire cannot achieve any success. The observer criticized Bevin's views on the Danube issue, arguing that the Danube is of the greatest importance to the countries within its basin, and therefore the Danube navigation system should first be decided by the Danube countries themselves. Regarding the former Italian colonies, the observer said: "It hardly needs to be argued that Britain's actual colonial goals are very far from this declaration. Simply put, it is to save British interests and privileges in North and Northeast Africa." The observer pointed out: "People should also consider the British argument regarding the issue of convening a 21-nation conference if the next foreign ministers' meeting fails, which can be seen from their insistence on unconditionally accepting Anglo-American suggestions. Bevin's entire speech, to a large extent, has a psychological preparation to completely return to the established principles of cooperation between the Allied powers. In the final analysis, this is another preparation to destroy the established procedures for the coordinated work of the Allied countries, attempting to exert pressure and threaten Soviet-British relations. It is almost unnecessary to say that this method is also useless and without benefit." The observer concluded: "In his speech, the British Foreign Secretary supported the anti-Soviet policy expressed in Churchill's notorious Fulton speech. It is not without significance that Churchill gave the Labour government a lot of praise in the House of Commons debate. The political observer of the *New Chronicle* said: "The Conservative Party feels that Bevin's speech is reasonable behavior and makes people believe that it supports Churchill's views in many respects." This observer's words are not hard to believe."

    真理报批评贝文演说
    意图摧毁同盟国合作
    支持了臭名远著的邱吉尔反苏观点
    【新华社延安十二日电】莫斯科讯：真理报国际观察家写道：英外相贝文在下院之演说中坚持英国代表团在巴黎会议上所保持的态度，但这并没有阻止贝文表现那种愿望，就是要苏联代表团回到巴黎时，应准备接受英美关于缔结对奥和约、意南边界、前意属殖民地、意大利赔款、多瑙河通航等问题的建议。贝文说：我认为这点如果办到，就是今年全年中信任和互相谅解的最好证据了。可是，贝文为什么在一个方面的让步，与其他方面的信任和互相谅解之间又划下一个等号呢？真实的信任和真正的互相谅解，与要求单方面让步两件事，是不可同日而语的。在平等的强国之间的谈判中，这种愿望，是不能获得任何成功的。该观察家批评贝文关于多瑙河问题的观点，认为多瑙河对于其流域之内的国家，是有着最大重要性的，因此多瑙河通航制，首先是应由多瑙河国家自家决定的问题。关于前意属殖民地问题，该观察家称：“几乎不需要辩驳、英国实际的殖民地目标，是离这种宣告很远很远的。简单的说来，就是救英国在北非和东北非的占有地利益和特权。该观察家指出：“人们也应该想到英国对于如果下次外长会议失败时召开二十一国会议问题的论点，可以在他们坚持要求别人无条件接受英美的建议上看出来。贝文的整篇演讲，在很大程度上，具有一种完全返回同盟强国间合作之既定原则的心理上的准备性质。归根到底，这又是一种准备摧毁同盟国国家协同工作的既定规程，企图施行压力并威胁对苏关系。用这种方法也毫无用处和好处，是几乎不必多说的。”该观察家结语称：“英外相在其演说中，支持了邱吉尔臭名远著的富尔顿演说中所表现的反苏政策。邱吉尔在下院辩论中，向工党政府投了不少赞美之辞，这不是无所谓的，新联纪事报政治观察家说：“保守党感到贝文这一演说是合理的行为，并使人相信它是在许多方面支持邱吉尔的观点”，这位观察家的话，是不难相信的。
