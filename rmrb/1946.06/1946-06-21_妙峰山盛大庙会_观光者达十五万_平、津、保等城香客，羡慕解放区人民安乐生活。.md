Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 15th. The temple fair at Miaofeng Mountain, located 40 kilometers west of Beiping within our Changping Liberated Area, reached its peak in the early part of the fourth month of the lunar calendar. Thanks to the efforts of the democratic government in construction, the local social order is becoming increasingly stable and transportation is extremely convenient. This year, the number of visitors from various places exceeded 150,000, especially pilgrims and tour groups from cities such as Beiping, Tianjin, and Baoding, as well as entertainment organizations such as the Lion Dance Association and the Stone Lock Association. The prosperity was unseen in seven or eight years. The democratic government provided thoughtful accommodation for travelers. In addition to theatrical performances, various forums were held at the temple fair. People from outside the area who came to worship at the mountain witnessed the free and happy life and the vigorous construction scene of the people in the Liberated Areas and were extremely envious.
