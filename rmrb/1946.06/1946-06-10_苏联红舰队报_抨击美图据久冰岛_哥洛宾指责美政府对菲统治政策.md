    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 6th: TASS reports: The Soviet Red Fleet News criticized the United States' attempt to permanently control bases in Iceland. The paper stated: The war is over, and everyone naturally expects foreign troops to honor the agreements between the Allies and Iceland and immediately withdraw from Iceland. This demand is very fair. Iceland voluntarily provided its territory to the Allies to defeat Germany. Now that it has fulfilled its role, there is no reason for the U.S. military to continue to be stationed on the island. The Red Fleet News stated: News reports from various countries show that the United States is conducting secret negotiations with Iceland, demanding to retain at least two bases and six radio stations in Iceland, and to obtain bases for its civil aviation. Britain, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway are all paying close attention to this. Many Danish social figures, in letters of protest to the government, demanded an immediate halt to negotiations with the United States, and emphasized that "the presence of foreign troops is incompatible with Icelandic sovereignty."

    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 6th: New York News: A pamphlet issued by the American Committee for Democratic Policy in the Far East strongly criticizes the American policy of maintaining rule over the Philippines. The author is Kolko, a former official of the American Military Tribunal in the Philippines and now the secretary of the National Lawyers Guild, a left-wing organization in the United States. He insists that current Philippine President Roxas is a proven traitor to the Philippines. He also criticizes the U.S. government and U.S. military authorities for their responsibility in supporting Roxas's election. The pamphlet condemns the U.S. objectives in the Philippines as maintaining its political, economic, and military control over the islands, thus violating previous promises to grant the Philippines genuine independence. The result of this policy will be that the Philippine economy will once again fall into the hands of a few special interests in the United States, Philippine independence will become a bubble, and Chiang Kai-shek will still be part of the Asian colonial system. The pamphlet concludes: The implementation of current U.S. policy has led to a rapid decline in the prestige of the United States among the Philippine people. Filipinos are gradually believing that the "independence" they will gain on July 4th will only be nominal independence.

    抨击美图据久冰岛
    哥洛宾指责美政府对菲统治政策
    【新华社延安六日电】据塔斯社电：苏红舰队报抨击美国企图永久控制冰岛基地。该报称：战争已结束，大家当然期望外国军队信守盟国与冰岛间的协定，立即撤离冰岛。这要求是很公平的。冰岛自愿将其领土供盟方作为击败德国之用，当它尽了它的作用以后，美军继续留驻该岛，便无任何理由了。红舰队报称：各国消息报导，美国正与冰岛进行秘密谈判，要求在冰岛至少保留两个基地，六个电台，并为其民航获得基地。英国、瑞典、丹麦与挪威对此均极注意。丹麦许多社会人士在致政府的抗议书中，要求立即停止与美国的谈判，并着重指出：“外国军队的留驻，是与冰岛主权不能并立的”。
    【新华社延安六日电】纽约讯：美国远东民主政策委员会发行之小册子，严责美国保持对菲统治的政策。作者是前菲岛美国军事法庭官员，现美国左翼全国律师公会的书记哥洛宾。他坚称：现菲总统罗哈斯为证据确凿的菲奸。并批评美政府与美军事当局应负支持罗哈斯当选的责任。小册子谴责美国对菲目的，为保持其对菲岛的政治、经济及军事的统制，因而违背了以前答应给菲岛真正独立的诺言。这政策的结果，将使菲岛的经济再度循于美国少数特殊利益分子手中，菲岛的独立，将又成为泡影，而且蒋仍旧成为亚洲殖民地系统的一部份。小册子的结语称：美国目前政策实施结果，已使美国在菲律滨人民中的威信迅速减退。菲人逐渐相信，他们在七月四日将获得的“独立”，将只是名义上的独立。
