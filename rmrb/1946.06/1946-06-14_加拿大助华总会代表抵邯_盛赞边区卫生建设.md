    【Handan, 6th dispatch】 Mr. A. Stewart Allen, representative of the Canadian China Aid Council and the Red Cross in China, accompanied by Comrade Su Jingguan, the chief of health of the Liberated Area Relief Association, flew from Beiping to Anyang on the 31st of last month and arrived in Handan that evening, staying at the Bianfu (Border Government) Reception Office. Yang Rong, the vice chairman, gave a reception for Mr. Liang and Comrade Su on the morning of the 1st at the Bianfu conference hall. It is reported that Mr. Liang Zhenglun came to observe the actual situation of the medical and health work and future construction plans in our border region. On the 1st, he visited the mobile clinic of the Border Region Health Bureau, the ophthalmic clinic of the Catholic Church, and the welfare nursery. In the afternoon of the same day, accompanied by Zhu Lian, the director of the Border Region Health Bureau, he visited the general hospital of the Xingtai Border Region International Peace Hospital, the hospitals attached to the Catholic Church and the Jesus Church, the Weixian Public Hospital, and the Linqing Border Region International Peace Hospital branch, for a total of four days. On the 5th, he returned to Anyang from Handan to return to Beiping. Mr. Liang traveled more than 800 li in five days, visited seven or eight health organizations, and carefully examined the conditions of more than 100 patients, which was extremely laborious. When visiting the mobile clinic of the Health Bureau, just as the doctor was performing surgery, Mr. Liang carefully observed and believed that the disinfection was strict. Although the equipment was very poor, the procedures were done very well. Before leaving, Mr. Liang expressed his feelings and said: "I sincerely admire the great achievements made in medical and health work in the border region under such difficult material conditions." He said: "When visiting the International Peace Hospital in Linqing, I personally visited and examined fifty or sixty patients, all of whom were in good spirits and had rosy complexions, indicating good nutrition." He found that none of these fifty or sixty patients had ever developed bedsores. He was very surprised and thought this was an illustration of the success of the medical work in the border region. Mr. Liang also said: "If I hadn't come to the liberated area, I wouldn't have had such a deep understanding of you. The biggest gain from this trip is that it completely exposed all the rumors about the liberated area fabricated by the Kuomintang outside."

    加拿大助华总会代表抵邯
    盛赞边区卫生建设
    【邯郸六日电】加拿大全加助华总会暨红十字会驻华代表梁正伦（A.Stewart Allen）先生，由解放区救济总会卫生总负责人苏井观同志陪同，于上月三十一日自北平飞安阳，当晚抵达邯郸下榻边府交际处，杨戎正副主席特于一日晨假边府会议厅为梁苏二氏洗尘。据悉梁正伦先生此来为参观我边区医药卫生工作及今后建设计划之实际情况。一日分别访问边区卫生局流动诊疗所，天主堂眼科诊疗所及福利托儿所，当日下午由边区卫生局朱琏局长陪同前往参观邢台边区国际和平医院总院，暨天主教堂与耶苏教堂附设医院，威县公立医院，临清边区国际和平医院分院等共历时四天。五日由邯郸回安阳返平。梁先生五天来行程八百余里，访问了卫生机关七八处，对百多名伤病员仔细详尽查看他们的病状，极为辛劳。当参观卫生局流动诊疗所时，正值医生在进行手术开刀，梁先生仔细观察后，认为消毒严密，虽然器械很劣，但手续作得很完好。临行前梁先生发表感想称：边区在如此困难的物质条件下，医药卫生工作作出这样大的成绩，衷心表示钦佩。他说：在临清参观国际和平医院时，亲自访问、检查过五六十个伤病员，人人都是精神愉快，面色红润，说明营养很好。他发现这五六十个伤病员中，没有一个人生过褥疮，他十分惊讶，认为这是边区医务工作作得有成绩的说明。梁先生并称：“我如不来解放区，就不会对你们有此深刻的了解，此来最大收获，完全揭破了在外边传闻国民党所制造的一切不利解放区的谣言”。
