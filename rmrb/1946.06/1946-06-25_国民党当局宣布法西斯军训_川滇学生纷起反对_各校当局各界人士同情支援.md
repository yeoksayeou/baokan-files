　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 22nd: Youth and students in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming and other places have risen up in opposition to the reactionary measures announced by the Kuomintang authorities to concentrate high school graduates for military training. Following the organization of the "Committee Against Concentrated Training for High School Graduates" by students of Chongqing Municipal Middle School, students from Sichuan Provincial Education College, Provincial Chongqing Middle School, Provincial Girls' Middle School, Vocational Schools, Provincial Commercial Vocational School, Chongqing Municipal Girls' Middle School, Wende Girls' Middle School, Jiangjin Girls' Middle School and other schools have also issued declarations expressing their firm opposition to this fascist military training. Hundreds of high school graduates wrote to the Democratic Daily exposing that "the real purpose of the fascists is not national defense, but mainly to create cadres for themselves, to sacrifice for the consolidation of their party's position, to expand the civil war, and to accelerate the destruction of the country." They also believe that even if there is to be concentrated training, it can only be "implemented after the formation of a democratic coalition government." Middle school students in Chengdu, centered on Northwest and Xiejin Middle Schools, organized the "United Association Against Military Training." The Kunming Student Federation, the student newspaper of Southwest Associated University, and the Youth New Newspaper of Yunnan University have also opposed military training. Students from a middle school in Jiangjin declared: "The warmongers in the Kuomintang want to use our pure students to fight a civil war, which is a great sin. Hundreds of thousands of male and female high school students must unite to crush this shameful conspiracy!" This anti-training movement has now gained the sympathy and support of school authorities and people from all walks of life. He Lu, the principal of Zai× Middle School in Chongqing, said: "This concentrated training is unacceptable, I am very opposed to it. School principals should stand up and speak out." Principals of Nankai, Fudan, Wende, Southwest Art, Ganjiang, and Jiali Middle Schools have all expressed dissatisfaction with the concentrated training. At a symposium, principals in Chengdu also expressed their opposition to the concentrated training. The Liaison Council of Academic Organizations of universities in Huaxiba expressed its full support for the anti-training. The Sichuan branch of the China Democratic League, the San Min Zhu Yi Comrades Association and other organizations have also put forward their opposition to the concentrated training in their recent opinions on the current situation. It is reported that after the Kuomintang authorities issued the decision on concentrated training for high school graduates, they prepared to organize more than 100,000 high school graduates nationwide into ten divisions, concentrated in nine regions including Shenyang and Beiping, and dispatch retired officers from the Youth Army to serve as instructors. After a little training, they would serve in the military for one year. Since it was met with fierce opposition from the vast number of students, the Kuomintang authorities have attempted to implement a high-pressure policy. The Chongqing Municipal Education Bureau summoned middle school principals at the end of May, threatening them to monitor student activities, prohibit opposition to concentrated training, and attempt to buy off a small number of special agents among the students to carry out sabotage. But contrary to their wishes, this anti-fascist military training movement has been surging forward in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in recent days.

　　国民党当局宣布法西斯军训
    川滇学生纷起反对
    各校当局各界人士同情支援
    【新华社延安二十二日电】渝、蓉、昆等地青年学生界，纷起反对国民党当局所宣布之高中毕业生集中军训的反动措施。继重庆市立中学学生组织“反对高中毕业生受集训运动委员会”后，四川省立教育学院、省立重庆中学、省立女中、职业学校、省立商业职业学校、重庆市立女中、文德女中、江津女中等校学生，亦纷纷发表宣言，表示坚决反对这一法西斯军训。数百高中毕业生投书民主报揭发：“法西斯们真正目的，并不在国防，主要的想为自己造干部，为巩固他们一党的地位去牺牲，去扩大内战，加速国家的毁灭而已”。并认为：即使要集训，亦只有“在民主的联合政府组成后，才能实施”。成都的中学生，则以西北、协进等中学为中心，组织了“反对集训联合会”。昆明学联，西南联大的学生报，云南大学的青年新报，亦纷纷反对军训。江津某中学学生宣称：“国民党内好战分子想利用我们纯洁的学生去打内战，这是天大的罪恶。几十万高中毕业的男女同学，一定要团结起来，粉碎这个可耻的阴谋”！这一反对集训运动，现已获得各校当局及各界人士之同情与支援。重庆载×中学校长何鲁说：“这个集训要不得，我很反对。各校校长应站出来说话”南开、复旦、文德、西南美术、赣江、嘉励等中学校长，对集训均表不满。成都各校长于座谈会上，对集训也表示反对。华西坝各大学学术团体联谊会，对反集训表示全力支援。民盟四川支部、三民主义同志联合会等会，近发表对时局意见中，亦提出反对集训。按国民党当局发布高中毕业生的集训决定后，即准备将全国十万余高中毕业生，编为十师，集中沈阳、北平等九个地区，派遣青年军退伍官佐担任教官，稍加训练，即服务兵役一年。自遭广大学生的猛烈反对，国民党当局复图实行高压政策。重庆市教育局曾于五月底召集中学校长谈话，威胁各校长监视学生行动，禁止反对集训，并图收买少数特务学生，进行破坏。但与他们愿望相反，这一反法西斯军训的运动，连日正在国民党区汹涌澎湃的继续开展。
