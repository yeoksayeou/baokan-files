Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: Moscow Dispatch: The Pravda diplomatic observer wrote on the 16th: On the eve of this Foreign Ministers' Conference, certain British and American newspapers are constantly talking about "national unity" on foreign policy issues. They want to create this so-called "unity" for different strategic purposes. They intend to use this appearance of "unity" as a reason to demand a "tough line" and "tough attitude" towards the Soviet Union. Behind a series of extravagant talks about so-called "national unity," some spokespersons openly advocate destroying international cooperation. The notorious Conservative Party's Daily Mail wrote: The resolution of international relations must be completed without the participation of the Soviet Union. The Washington correspondent of the Associated Press claimed: Matters have now reached the stage of presenting a "real ultimatum" to the Soviet Union. These irresponsible spokespersons are all demanding a permanent end to four-power conferences, and in the future, only twenty-one-nation conferences should be held. These are the people who chose to break with Potsdam as their "motto." And some people are trying to "replace the Potsdam Agreement" with something else on this ambiguous basis. French journalist Bettina wrote: "Britain and the United States have shown a pro-German tendency." The true meaning of this tendency is very clear, that is, the revival of the "balance of power policy" on the European continent. Germany is being used as a force against both France and the Soviet Union. The famous American radio commentator Steele revealed that these people seemed ecstatic about the prospect of a stalemate. He reached an outstanding conclusion: that the characteristic of American policy can be said to be a policy of permanent stalemate. Steele said: If the three major powers establish the principles of unity and cooperation, then all these stalemates will end. The "lovers" of all forms of stalemate should give this conclusion some serious consideration.

    揭露英美反苏论调
    【新华社延安十八日电】莫斯科讯：真理报外交观察家于十六日写道：在这次外长会议开会的前夕，某些英美报纸不断谈着外交政策问题上“举国一致”的话。他们要创造这种所谓“一致”，是为了不同的策略目的。他们意欲利用这种“一致”的表征，作为要求对苏“强硬方针”“强硬态度”等等的理由。在所谓“举国一致”的一连串侈谈的后面，有些代言人公开主张摧毁国际合作。臭名远扬的保守党每日邮报写道：国际关系的解决，必须不要苏联参加而完成之。合众社华盛顿记者称：现在的事情已经到了对苏联提出“真正的最后通牒”的阶段。这些不负责任的代言人，都要求永远终止召开四国会议，将来只要开二十一国会议就行了。就是这些人，他们选择了与波茨顿决裂，作为他们的“座右铭”。而有些人则在这种暖昧的基础上，设法要以别的东西来“代替波茨顿协定”。法国记者贝蒂那写道：“英美表现了一种有利于德国的倾向”。这种倾向的真实意义，是十分清楚的，那就是欧洲大陆上“均势政策”的复活。德国被利用作为同时针对法国和苏联的力量。美国著名无线电评论员斯蒂尔揭露了这些人他们的行动，似乎对于僵局的前途，欣喜欲狂。他达到一杰出的结论：即美国的政策其特点，可以说就是永久僵局的政策。斯蒂尔说：如果三大国确立了团结和合作的原则，则这一切僵局均将终止，凡是一切形态的僵局的“爱好者们”，对于这个结论，应该有一些严肃的考虑。
