Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd. Dispatch from Beiping: On the 30th of last month, General Ye Jianying of the Military Mediation Department, accompanied by the Communist representatives of the Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Gaomi, and Yancheng groups in Beiping, visited comrades working at the *Beiping Jiefang Ribao* and the Xinhua branch at 9 Fanghu Zhai outside Xuanwu Gate on behalf of all the Communist personnel of the Military Mediation Department, to express sympathy for the illegal closure of these organizations by the Kuomintang authorities. Committee member Ye said in his speech: "The *Beiping Jiefang Ribao* sells more than 40,000 copies every day, which is the highest circulation of newspapers in Beiping. This is the best test of the people's psychology and a symbol of the victorious future of the people's cause." He continued: "The *Jiefang Ribao* and the Xinhua branch were regarded as thorns in the side by the reactionary forces and forcibly closed down at the expense of breaking their promises because they spoke for the common people, promoted justice, and ruthlessly exposed the crimes of the reactionaries. Although the Kuomintang reactionaries are rampant for a while, in the face of the power of the people, they will eventually suffer the consequences of their fascist tyranny, and the cause of peace and democracy in China must be victorious." Finally, he encouraged everyone to study harder and continue to fight. Tao Xijin and Zhang Liankui, the Communist representatives of the Shijiazhuang and Taiyuan groups, used the good impressions of the people in the locations of their groups to illustrate the prestige of the *Jiefang Ribao* among the people, and encouraged their colleagues to make unyielding efforts for the people's news undertakings.
	
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st. Airmail from Beiping: According to reports in Beiping newspapers on the 30th, the newspapers and periodicals that have been banned include *Jiefang Ribao*, Xinhua Branch, *Beiping Magazine*, *147 Weekly*, *Film and Drama*, *World Five-Day*, *Guanghua Daily*, *Scientific Knowledge Monthly*, *Chinese Science Monthly*, *Teenager Weekly*, *Teenager Bi-Monthly*, *Collection Bi-Monthly*, *Beiping Times Children's Monthly*, *Beiping Postal Journal*, *Science Times Monthly*, *Literature and Mass Ten-Day*, *Sound and Picture Pictorial Five-Day*, *New China News*, *Drama and Film Daily*, *Dahua News*, *Lu Xun Evening News*, *Jian Guo Daily*, *Victory Monthly*, *Commercial Daily*, *Law Review Quarterly*, *Beiping Pictorial*, *Film and Drama Ten-Day*, *Times Life Three-Day*, *Economic Education Bi-Monthly*, *Student Weekly*, *Science and Life Monthly*, *Zheng Lun Weekly*, *Beiping Student News*, *Peace News Agency*, *Upright News Agency*, *Times News Agency*, *Xinping News Agency*, *World and China Monthly*, *Buddhist Monthly*, *Grace Half-Monthly*, *Mediocrity Half-Monthly*, *My Newspaper*, *Life Pictorial Ten-Day*, *New Road Weekly*, *Eurasia News Agency*, *University Weekly*, *Ignorance Amusement Monthly*, *Mass Guide*, *Spring Bright Pictorial*, *Metropolitan Pictorial*, *China People's Daily*, *XXX Medical Journal*, *Modern Knowledge Society*, "Home" Monthly, *China Rural Monthly*, *Hebei News Agency*, *Agricultural Production Monthly*, *Children's Half-Monthly*, *China Electric News Agency*, *Progress Ten-Day*, *Century Monthly*, *National New News*, *Beiping Entertainment News*, *Economic Times*, *Lisheng English Weekly*, *Lisheng English Selections*, *Rural Sideline Monthly*, *Culture Monthly*, *Beiping Hua News*, *National New News Evening*, *Tianjin Chamber of Commerce Beiping Branch*, *National News Agency*, *China New Joint News Agency*, totaling 77. Such an incident of undermining public opinion is truly shocking. What is particularly noteworthy is that a small number of the 77 newspapers are official Kuomintang newspapers, such as *Jian Guo Daily*. Although they were also ordered to cease publication, they were actually just superficial window-dressing, and they continued to publish as usual the next day, without being hindered. This further proves that this atrocity is a planned and organized conspiracy. After this incident occurred, all circles in Beiping expressed indignation and offered condolences to the *Jiefang Ribao* and Xinhua branch and other progressive newspapers and periodicals, and expressed their determination to fight to the end against fascist atrocities and strive for freedom of speech and publication.

    叶剑英将军等亲往慰问
    解放报新华分社诸同志
    勉励大家努力学习，继续为人民的新闻事业不屈不挠奋斗。
    【新华社延安三日电】北平讯：上月三十日军调部叶剑英将军，偕在平之石庄、太原、高密、宴城小组中共代表，代表军调部中共全体人员，至宣武门外方壶斋九号，慰问日前被国民党当局非法查封之北平解放报及新华分社工作同志。叶委员致词称：“北平解放报每日销售四万余份，为平市报纸之销数冠。这是一种最好的人民心理测验，是人民事业胜利前途的象征”。继谓：“解放报和新华分社，是因为替老百姓讲话，宣传正义，无情揭露反动派的罪行而被他们视为眼中钉，不惜破坏诺言，强行封闭的。国民党反动派虽然猖獗一时，但在人民的力量面前，终会自食他们法西斯暴政的恶果，中国的和平民主事业，一定要胜利”。最后他勉励大家加紧学习，继续奋斗。石庄、太原小组中共代表陶希晋、张连奎二氏，以小组所在地人民的良好印象，说明解放报在人民中的威信，勉励同人为人民的新闻事业，作不屈不挠之努力。
    【新华社延安一日电】北平航讯：据三十日平市报载：遭查禁的报刊有解放报、新华分社、北平杂志、一四七周刊、电影与戏剧、世界五日刊、光华日报、科学知识月刊、中国科学月刊、少年周报刊、少年半月刊、集纳半月刊、北平时代儿童月刊、北平邮刊、科学时报月刊、文艺与大众旬刊、影声画报五日刊、新中国报、戏影日报、大华报、鲁迅晚报、建国日报、战胜月刊、商业日报、法律×论季刊、北平画报、电影与戏剧旬刊、时代生活三日刊、经济教育半月刊、学生周刊、科学与生活月刊、正论周刊、北平学生报、和平通讯社、正直通讯社、时代通讯社、新平通讯社、世界与中国月刊、佛学月刊、恩光半月刊、中庸半月刊、我的报、生活画报旬刊、新路周刊、欧亚新闻社、大学周报、愚昧游艺月刊、大众导报、春明画报、大都会画报、中华民报、××医刊、现代知识社、“家”月刊、中国农村月刊、河北通讯社、农业生产月刊、儿童半月刊、中国电联社、进步旬刊、世纪月刊、国民新报、北平游艺报、经济时报、立生英语星期刊、立生英文选、农村副业月刊、文化月刊、北平华报、国民新报晚刊、天津商联社北平分社、国民通讯社、中国新联社等共七十七家之多。此种摧残舆论事件，实属骇人听闻。尤其值得注意的，是七十七家报纸中有少数系国民党官方报纸，如建国日报等，虽然也被勒令停刊，实际上只是表面的陪衬，第二天仍照常出版，不受阻碍。这愈更证明此次暴行，实系一有计划有组织之阴谋，此事发生后，平市各界咸表愤慨，纷纷慰问解放报及新华分社及其他进步报刊，并表示誓为反对法西斯暴行，争取言论出版自由抗争到底。
