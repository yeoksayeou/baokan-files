The government welcomes refugees returning to the liberated areas.
For returning refugees from impoverished families, provide material assistance to help them settle down and resume production, and establish their households. Provide returning students, intellectuals, and technical personnel with convenient access to education and work. For those who fled to escape punishment, the government will adopt a lenient policy, deal with them leniently, and give them a path to self-renewal.
Denounces the Kuomintang area for falsely accusing us of obstructing the return of refugees.

[Special dispatch from this newspaper] On May 29th, a reporter visited the spokesperson of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government to inquire about the issue of refugees returning home. The spokesperson responded as follows:

Q: What is the Border Government's attitude towards refugees returning home?

A: The government sincerely welcomes and makes every effort to help refugees returning home, whether they are passing through or returning to the liberated areas. People who fled due to war and famine all hope to return. Even those who have some dissatisfaction or misunderstanding of the liberated areas also hope to return. After they see the facts in the liberated areas, all misunderstandings and doubts will disappear. As long as they abide by the laws of the border region, they will also be protected by the law. We hope they do not think that the government will not trust them because they are returning to the border region from the outside, because they are basically good people and the government understands them very well. It is inevitable that there are a few bad people among them. Even if they occasionally violate the law, the government will still be lenient, educate and persuade them. If that doesn't work, we will deal with them according to law. The word "law" has caused many misunderstandings outside the liberated areas. Some people even propagate that the law in the liberated areas is "murder," which is a deliberate slander and not worth refuting. I dare say that the law in the liberated areas is based on democracy and freedom, and is supported by the broad masses of the people. Only traitors and fascists will think that these laws are unfavorable to them.

Q: Are there any written regulations regarding the return of refugees in the border region now?

A: Yes, the administrative guidelines of our region emphasize this issue, and clearly decide on the policy of welcoming and helping refugees returning home. All districts have specific measures, which have been implemented long ago. For example, the announcement issued by the Jinan Administrative Office on March 15th was based on the above-mentioned policy, with a total of five articles: 1. All people returning home must report and register with our county and district governments so that they can be welcomed, cared for, comforted, and relieved, or introduced to occupations according to different circumstances. 2. For returning refugees who are from impoverished families and cannot maintain their lives, the government will provide necessary material assistance. The villagers and their relatives should adhere to the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual aid to help them solve various difficulties in food, clothing, and housing, so that they can settle down, resume production, and establish their households. 3. Returning young students, intellectuals, and various technical personnel are even more welcome. They should register with our governments above the county level so that they can pursue further education or participate in various construction projects. 4. Returning personnel of puppet troops and puppet organizations, and fugitives from justice, should immediately go to our governments above the county level to go through the procedures of repentance. Our democratic government will adopt a lenient policy, deal with them leniently, or exempt them from punishment, giving them a path to self-renewal. 5. If there are spies, secret agents, and other unscrupulous people who, in the name of returning home, mix into the Jin-Ji-Nan area, attempt to undermine the cause of peace and construction, and endanger the interests of the people, they will be escorted to the government for legal action once they are discovered with evidence.

Q: What other matters need to be made known to them before entering the border region?

A: 1. Do not carry weapons. After the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the entry into peaceful construction, people and institutions in the liberated areas are not allowed to keep weapons. Private guns should be registered with the Public Security Bureau, and the government will buy them back at a price. If they are concealed and not reported, they will be confiscated if found later. As for the guns of the militia, they are permitted by the government. 2. Do not carry fascist propaganda. Fascist propaganda is not recognized internationally. Not all books, newspapers, and magazines from non-liberated areas are called fascist propaganda. Many books and newspapers from Chongqing in the past, and Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing and other places now, enter the liberated areas. 3. Must abide by the laws of the border region. For example, if the law stipulates rent reduction and interest reduction, it must be implemented. You cannot refuse to implement it on the grounds that "I did not reduce rent and interest in the Kuomintang area."

Q: What about the land change situation after their exile, which is the most concerning issue for some returning refugees? How can it be mediated?

A: Before their exile, most of them designated their relatives and neighbors as trustees. A very small number who did not designate a trustee were managed by the government. Except for the land of major traitors which is confiscated according to law, the remaining land relations are protected by law and have not been changed. There are two types of changes in the land with trustees: First, after the Border Government promulgated the rent reduction and interest reduction decree in November 1937, if they still illegally collected excessive rents or even continued to over-exploit, and when tenants demanded rent reduction and refund of excessive rents, the trustee sold the landlord's land because they had no grain. Also, when legally clearing debts or settling burdens, the trustee had to sell the land to fulfill legal obligations because they had no cash grain. These changes are all legal, because managing property on behalf of someone requires fulfilling legal obligations on behalf of the landlord. Secondly, there are those who privately sold land during the four years of famine. This belongs to private transactions, and the government is not responsible. If the original owner disagrees, they can file a lawsuit. Those who are managed by the government are leased to farmers for cultivation to prevent the land from being deserted. When the original owner returns home, it is completely returned. The issue of tenancy is resolved in accordance with the Land Law. If the original owner takes back the land and the tenant cannot make a living, causing disputes, the government will mediate according to law.

Q: The Kuomintang government-controlled area is rumored that the liberated area is obstructing the return of refugees. What is your opinion on this?

A: Fortunately, the rumors came from their area. I have this fact to tell you: As of May 24th, 199 compatriots from provinces such as Hunan, Shaanxi, Shandong, and Henan who passed through the liberated area to return to eastern Hebei and the Northeast directly passed through Handan City. We subsidized medical expenses and travel expenses of 28,300 yuan, and 960 jin of millet, totaling about 296,000 legal tender. This is just one of the many refugees passing through. You can go to various places to see that returnees or refugees are traveling all the way, coming from all directions. You can also ask the Zhou Longtang Village in Jinan. When we first liberated the area, there were only a few households, but now there are more than a hundred households. What does this show? Facts speak louder than words. The rumors in the Kuomintang-controlled area have their own meaning, and we do not bother to discuss them further. What we hope is that comrades in the press should convey the government's policies and the current facts of the border region to the displaced compatriots in various ways, so as to dispel their doubts and help our party fulfill its responsibility to the displaced refugees.

    晋冀鲁豫边府发言人答记者
    政府欢迎难民回解放区
    还乡难民家境贫苦者，予以物资救济，使其安家生产，建立家务；还乡学生知识分子及技术人材，予以入学工作便利；畏罪潜逃分子，政府一本宽大政策，从轻处理，予以自新之路。
    痛斥国民党区诬蔑我阻挠难民还乡                  
    【本报特讯】记者于五月二十九日以难民还乡问题走访晋冀鲁豫边区政府发言人，承答如次：
    问：请问边府对难民还乡之态度若何？
    答：难民还乡，无论过境或回解放区，政府是竭诚欢迎与尽力帮助。过去因战争与灾荒而流亡的人民都盼望回来，即使有对解放区存在若干不满或不了解者也希望回来。他们只要看到解放区内的事实以后，一切误解与怀疑都会消失。只要遵守边区法律也一样得到法律的保障，希望他们不要以为自己是从外面回到边区来的政府就不相信他们，因为他们基本上都是好老百姓，政府是很了解的。其中也不免有个别不好的人，偶有违法情事，政府对他们也仍然是宽大，教育说服，如果无效，才依法处理。“法律”两字在解放区外曾引起不少误解，甚至有人宣传解放区法律即是“杀人”，这是故意诬蔑，不值一驳，我敢说解放区的法律是在民主自由基础上的法律，广大人民所拥护的，只有汉奸与法西斯才会以为这些法律是不利的。
    问：现在边区有无关于难民还乡之成文法规？
    答：有，本区行政工作方针着重的提出了这个问题，明确决定了对难民还乡的欢迎帮助方针。各区都有具体办法，早已实施。如冀南行署三月十五日之布告即本上述方针而定，其中共五条：一、凡还乡的人们，均须到我县区政府报告登记，以便根据不同情形，分别予以欢迎照顾，安抚救济或介绍职业。二、还乡难民，有家境贫苦，无法维持生活的，政府当予以必要之物质救济，本村民众及其亲友更要本互济互救之精神，帮助其解决衣食住之各项困难，使其安家生产，建立家务。三、还乡的青年学生知识分子及各种技术人材，更所欢迎，应该到我县级以上政府报名登记，以便入学深造或参加各项建设事业。四、还乡之伪军伪组织人员，及畏罪潜逃分子，应即到我县级以上政府办理悔过手续，我民主政府当一本宽大政策，从轻处理，或免予处罚，给以自新之路。五、如有奸细、特务等不肖之徒，借还乡为名，混入晋冀南区、企图破坏和平建设事业，危害人民利益者，一经查觉有据，即行押送政府法办。
    问：还有那些事项在入境前就须要让他们知道的？
    答：一，不要携带武器，抗日战争结束进入和平建设后，解放区内人民及机关人员不得保存武器，私人枪枝向公安局登记，由政府给价收买。如隐匿不报，以后查出即予没收，至于民兵枪枝系经政府许可。二，不要携带法西斯宣传品。法西斯宣传品是不为国际间所公认者，不是凡来自非解放区的书报杂志都称之为法西斯宣传品，无论过去的重庆，现在的南京、上海、天津、北平等地的书报很多进入解放区的。三，须遵行边区法律、如法律规定减租减息，必须执行，不能以“我在国民党地区没有减租减息”为由而不执行。
    问：目前部分还乡难民所最关切者即为他们流亡后的土地变更情况怎样调解法，可否见答？
    答：在他们流亡前大多指定其亲属邻家作代管人，绝少数没有指定代管人者由政府代管。除大汉奸土地依法没收外，其余土地关系均受到法律保护，未予变更。有代管理者土地之变动情况有二：一是边府在三七年十一月颁布减租减息法令后，如果仍旧违法多收租子甚至依旧超额外剥削，在佃户要求减租退还多收佃租时，该代管人因无粮而出卖地主之土地。还有在依法清理债务或清算负担时，该代管人因无现粮现款不能不变卖土地以履行法律义务。这些变动全是合法的，因为代管财产就必须代地主履行法律义务。其次是在四年灾荒中代管人有私自出卖土地者，这属于私人买卖，政府不负责任，如原业主不同意时，可以起诉。由政府代管者，为使土地不致荒芜，租给农民耕种，原业主回家时，完全发还。并依照土地法解决租佃问题。如原主人收回土地，佃户无以为生而发生纠纷时，政府依法从中调解。
    问：国民党政府统治区盛传解放区阻挠难民还乡，对此有何意见？
    答：好在谣言是从他们地区传来的。我有这样的事实告诉你：载至五月二十四日，自湘、陕、鲁、豫等省道经解放区返冀东，东北的同胞，直接经过邯郸市者即有一百九十九人。我们资助医约路费二万八千三百元，小米九百六十斤，综计约合法币二十九万六千元。这只是很多路过难民中之一件而已。你可以到各地方去看看，返乡或流亡者洛绎于途，从那方面来的均有。你还可以去问问如冀南的周龙堂村在我们初解放该地时只有几户人家，现在已百余户了，这说明什么呢？事实胜于雄辩，国民党统治区的谣传，自有其另外的意义，我们不屑多论。所希望的，新闻界同志应该多把政府的方针与边区现在的事实，以各种方法多传达给在外流亡的同胞们，使他们去掉疑虑，以帮助我党尽到对流亡难民的责任。
