    Victory in Defending the Summer Harvest
    Our Army's One Squad in Huijia Repels a Battalion of Stubborn Troops
    Yan's Army Conspires to Invade Fenyang Wheat-Producing Area

    [Report from this newspaper] On May 16th, in Huijia, Northern Henan, Wu Village's stubborn troops, led by Li Changwu's unit of the puppet district office, fired upon our masses who were harvesting wheat. Our soldiers and civilians bravely repelled them, resulting in injuries to one of our civilians and two soldiers. On the 28th, a battalion of the 401st Regiment of the Kuomintang's 32nd Division, carrying two heavy machine guns and one cannon, attacked our Nanwang River, but was repelled by one squad of our garrisoned troops. On the 26th, the stubborn district of Tugao, under the cover of the militia, reaped more than ten *qing* of wheat overnight. The militia self-defense force also collectively guarded the fields at night to prevent sabotage by special agents.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 8th] Yan's army is actively increasing its troops in Pingyao, Jiexiu, Fenyang, and Xiaoyi. They are establishing strongholds for搶麥(rob wheat) and seizing our wheat fields. The twenty-plus villages and towns east of the Pingyao-Jiexiu-Fenyang-Xiaoyi highway and west of the Fen River were completely occupied by Yan's army in the latter half of last month. Yan's army is also building bunkers in Qiaojiazhuang, Ningguan and other villages near Fenyang, as well as in Wenhou village west of the Fenxiao Road. On the 2nd, more than 600 artillery soldiers from a regiment from Hongtong Zhaocheng area were transferred to Pingyao and Fenyang, accompanied by two mountain guns, three mortars, and eight trucks loaded with artillery shells. The Yan-appointed county magistrate of Pingyao is also busy organizing a "wheat seizing assault team," ordering blacksmiths to make two thousand sickles and commissioning three thousand hemp ropes. Liu Xiaozeng, the division commander of the 70th Division in Fenyang, recently convened a party, government, and military meeting to plan an attack on us to seize wheat, attempting to invade our entire wheat-producing area in Fenyang Pingchuan. The Yan-appointed county government of Fenyang is also forcing each village to rush-produce cloud ladders and conscripting ten thousand men to seize and transport wheat. On the 2nd, a unit of the 208th Regiment, consisting of more than 50 men, attacked our garrison in Wangchun Village (more than ten *li* east of Fenyang City). On the 4th, the 208th Regiment again attacked our city north with more than 300 men, but were repelled by us.
