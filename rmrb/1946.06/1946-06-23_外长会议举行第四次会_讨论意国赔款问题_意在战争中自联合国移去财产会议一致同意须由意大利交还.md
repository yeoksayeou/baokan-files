Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: Paris – The Council of Foreign Ministers held its fourth session on the afternoon of the 19th to discuss technical issues related to Italian reparations. First, the issue of property restitution: the conference unanimously agreed that Italy must return the property it forcibly or coercively removed from the territories of the United Nations during the war. The French delegation believed that Italy only acquired certain properties requested by (missing number) of the United Nations, not by force or coercion, but Molotov insisted on normal judicial procedures. According to this procedure, the United Nations itself should prove that those properties were seized by force or coercion. This issue has been referred to experts for discussion. Second, economic and financial terms for Italy's cession of territory: the four foreign ministers agreed on the technical recommendations of the assistants, which stipulated the rights and obligations of the countries taking over the ceded territories. Third, general economic relations: the conference discussed the issue of compensation for the property that citizens of the United Nations might lose due to Italian nationalization. The United States proposed investigating whether these citizens had proof, which was accepted by France and Britain. The Soviet Union opposed self-certification and proposed that such proof could only be approved with mutual consent. This issue was submitted for discussion at a later meeting. Fourth, the issue of compensation for individual losses: the four countries jointly studied the British and French proposals, which stipulated that Italy should compensate for individual losses suffered by United Nations civilians, such as mistreatment. The United States and the Soviet Union both requested that this clause not be stipulated, but after Bidault explained it, Molotov agreed in principle to compensation. However, he put forward two conditions: (1) People concerned, regardless of their nationality, have the right to claim compensation; (2) The principle of compensation should apply to all citizens of the United Nations who have been occupied by Italy. The implication of the second condition is that not only should individual losses on Italian territory be compensated, but also losses suffered by Greeks, Albanians, Soviets, and Frenchmen outside Italy who were mistreated during the Italian military occupation of their respective countries should also be compensated. Bevin acknowledged that the Soviet proposal was fair, but believed that it would be difficult to implement, and declared that he was prepared to abandon his original proposal. Bidault also held the same attitude. Molotov asked Bidault to express his opinion for consideration. Therefore, Bidault suggested using several million lira for this compensation fee, and Molotov proposed that this suggestion be submitted to the assistants for review. The foreign ministers did not make a decision on this issue.

　　外长会议举行第四次会
    讨论意国赔款问题
    意在战争中自联合国移去财产会议一致同意须由意大利交还
    【新华社延安二十日电】巴黎讯：外长会议于十九日下午举行第四次会，讨论有关意大利赔款的技术问题。第一是财产归还问题：会议一致同意意大利须交还它在战争期间自联合国领土上以武力或强迫所移去之财产。法国代表团认为意大利徒以（中缺数字）某一联合国所要求之财产，不是用武力或强迫得来的，但莫洛托夫主张用正常的司法程序。按照这一程序，应由联合国本身证明那些财产是用武力或强迫占去的，此问题已交由专家讨论。第二是意国割让领土之经济与财政条款：四外长同意各助理的技术性建议，其中规定接管割让领土之国家的权利与义务。第三是一般的经济关系：会议讨论了联合国公民由于意大利国有化可能丧失所有权之财产的赔偿问题。美国提议调查这些公民是否有证明即可，法英接受此意见，苏联反对自行证明，并提议此种证明，只有在双方同意后，方能予以批准。此问题被提交以后会议讨论。第四是个人有受损失的赔偿问题：四国一同研究了英法的建议，其中规定意大利应赔偿联合国平民所受之个人损失，例如虐待。美国与苏联均要求不规定这一条款，但在比道尔从中说明后，莫洛托夫在原则上同意赔偿。但提出两个条件：（一）有关人民不管其国籍为何，均有权要求赔偿；（二）赔偿原则，应适用于曾受意占领之一切联合国之公民。第二个条件的含意，即不仅应允许意国领土上个人损失予以赔偿，而且在意国外之希腊人、阿尔巴尼亚人，苏联人及法国人，在意军占领各该国时，受到虐待者所受损失，亦应予以赔偿贝文承认苏方之建议甚为公平，但认为实行时困难，并宣称他准备放弃他的原案。比道尔亦持同样态度。莫洛托夫要求比道尔应发表意见，以供考虑。于是比道尔建议以数万里拉为此项赔偿费，莫洛托夫提议此项建议交助理审查，各外长对此问题未作决定。
