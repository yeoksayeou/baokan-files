Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: Moscow Radio on the 10th: Commentator Masinu, citing the English-language *China Press* commentary on the composition of the newly established Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense, said: Appointing Bai Chongxi as Minister of National Defense contradicts the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference because Bai Chongxi and He Yingqin are both civil war experts. Appointing Gu Zhutong as Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army is tantamount to ordering him to suppress the Communists, as he is also a well-known anti-Communist civil war expert. The newspaper's reporter believes that the Ministry of National Defense is very much like a headquarters for planning and organizing civil war.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: Moscow Radio today: The 11th issue of New Era magazine published an article on the current situation in China, pointing out that recent developments in China have returned China to the pre-war situation. Chinese reactionaries, disregarding the resolutions already reached at the Political Consultative Conference, are using American transportation and munitions to attack Chinese democratic forces. The stance taken by the Kuomintang leadership is puzzling: Will the solution to the Chinese question rely on the government and leaders adopting political methods, or will it employ military offensives? The solution to the Chinese question should rely on adopting methods to implement the decisions of the Moscow Conference of the Three Foreign Ministers on the Chinese question, namely, implementing the decision to democratize and unify China.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 10th: The Shanghai *Wenhui Bao* published an editorial on the 28th of last month titled "A Change That Achieves Nothing" regarding the personnel changes in the Kuomintang government, believing that "finding a few people who have always maintained a very close relationship with the government to participate is nothing more than 'deceiving the heavens and changing the earth'… It will not only fail to help solve the KMT-CPC problem, but will also pose a threat." The Shanghai *United Evening News* also stated: "The Executive Yuan has basically not changed, and figures in education, internal affairs, society, and diplomacy remain firmly in place. Although Wang Yunwu is not a member of the Kuomintang, he cannot play a decisive role in changing policies. Bai Chongxi is in the same category as He Yingqin; he once planned military offensives with He, which explains everything." On June 4th, the *Wenhui Bao* commented on the establishment of the Kuomintang government's Ministry of National Defense, arguing that "in today's situation where political democratization has not been realized, the people have no say in the number of troops to be raised and military expenditures. The so-called government army or national army can only be said to be an army privately owned by one party. Before this situation is changed, there is no point in talking about 'returning the army to the nation,' let alone 'adopting a military system of a democratic country'" (as said by Chen Cheng and Bai Chongxi). The newspaper also stated: "The joint submission by Gu Zhutong, Zhang Fakui, and others to Chairman Chiang, strongly advocating the suppression of the Communists, and Chen Cheng's open declaration in his memorial week report on the Pinghan situation that 'if the Communist army injures one of us, we will injure two of them,' shows that the military is still interfering in politics. Establishing a Ministry of National Defense under these conditions will subordinate politics to the military." In these two editorials, the newspaper emphasized that only by "abandoning one-party dictatorship and truly implementing democracy" can the KMT-CPC problem be solved and a military system of a democratic country be implemented.

    中外舆论指责国民党蓄意内战
    “国防部”乃是内战大本营
    中国问题应依莫斯科会议决定解决
    【新华社延安十一日电】莫斯科十日广播：评论员马西努，引证英文字林西报评论最近国民党成立的国防部成份时说：白崇禧当国防部长，是与政协决议相矛盾的，因为白崇禧与何应钦都是内战专家。委任顾祝同为中国陆军总司令，是在叫他镇压共产党人，因为他也是有名的反共内战专家。该报记者认为，国防部很像是一个计划与组织内战的大本营。
    【新华社延安十一日电】莫斯科今日广播：新时代杂志十一期登载论中国现况一文，指出中国最近时期发展的事变，使中国回到了战前的状况，中国反动分子不顾政协会议上所已达到的决议，利用美国交通运输和军火，向中国民主力量进攻。国民党领导机关所采取的立场，令人发闷：解决中国问题将是依靠政府与领导者采取政治办法，还是采用武力进攻？中国问题的解决依靠，应该采取办法，实现三国外长莫斯科会议关于中国问题的决议，即是实行使中国民主化与统一的决定。
    【新华社淮阴十日电】沪文汇报于上月二十八日为国民党政府人事变更，以“无济于事的改变”为题发表社评，认为“找几个一向与政府保持极密切关系的人士参加，那不过是‘偷天换日’……………对解决国共问题，不但不能有所帮助，且有威胁作用”。沪联合晚报亦称：“行政院基本上未变，教育、内政、社会、外交人士，屹然未动。王云五虽非国民党员，但不能起决定与改变政策作用。白崇禧则与何应钦一类，渠曾与何布置军事进攻，此即已说明一切”。六月四日，文汇报评论国民党政府国防部的成立，认为“政治民主化并未实现的今天，人民对养军的兵额和军费，根本无有过问。所谓政府军或国民军，实际上只能说是一党私有的军队。在这种情况未改变前，根本谈不上“还军于国”，更说不上“采取民主国军事制度”，（陈诚、白崇禧语）。该报并称：“由顾祝同、张发奎等联呈蒋主席，力主剿共，及陈诚在纪念周报告平汉局势中之公然宣称：“如共军伤我一人，我便伤共二人”，足见军人尚在干预政治，在这种条件下成立国防部，将使政治隶属于军事。该报此两次社论中，均着重指出惟有“放弃一党专政，真正实行民主”，才能解决国共问题，才能实行民主国家的军事制度。
