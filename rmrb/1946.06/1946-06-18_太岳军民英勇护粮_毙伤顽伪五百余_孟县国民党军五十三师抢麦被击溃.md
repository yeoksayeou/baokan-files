    【Our Yangcheng Dispatch】 The military and civilians in the Taiyue border areas have entered an extremely tense stage in defending the wheat harvest. The struggle to protect grain is in full swing. In the past half-month (from May 25th to June 10th), Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's troops used more than 7,000 soldiers to seize wheat, invading our liberated areas including Taibi, Xifeng Fort, and Gu County in Hongtong, Yongning, Kuisi Head, Tundou Village, Shangyi Village, Xichengquan, and Dongwang Village in Linfen, Weicun, Dongyang, Chuhe, Donggao Village, and Xigao Village in Quwo, Guocun in Anyi, Yunan, Chaijiapo, and Li Village in @ County, Xialiang, Suncun, Zhongliang, Nanliang, Yaocun, and Shijiazhuang in Xiangling, villages near the county seat of Wenxi, Dongmengzhuang, Ximengzhuang, Zhangwa, Majiling, Jin'e, Zuoshan, and Liudian in Meng County, Macun and Hengqiao in Xin@, and Yindi in Huo County, totaling 35 villages to seize grain. All these attempts were repelled by our defending troops or militia rotation teams and river defense teams. Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's troops suffered a total of over 500 casualties. The main battles are described as follows: (1) One day, more than 400 of Yan Xishan's troops from Wenxi City came out to seize wheat and attacked the defense area of the Independent Company of our 32nd Unit. Our defending troops, in coordination with the local militia, counterattacked, inflicting more than 40 casualties on Yan's troops. The attempt to seize grain failed, and they fled back to the city. (2) One day, more than 200 members of Yan Xishan's "Love the Homeland Corps" from Linfen City attacked Shangguan Village in our second district to seize wheat, engaging in fierce fighting with the Shangguan militia. After three hours of hard fighting, Yan's troops were defeated and retreated with injuries. (3) On the 2nd, more than 200 troops of Chen Ziwen's unit from @ County occupied the high ground one mile east of our Yunan, forcibly harvesting civilian wheat, and engaged in fierce fighting with us. Chen's unit suffered more than 30 casualties before retreating. (4) On the 7th, after the 159th Regiment and the 158th Regiment of the 53rd Division of Meng County were defeated in their attack on our Majiling (15 li northeast of Potou, Jiyuan) position, at dawn on the 10th, they again used one battalion each from the 157th Regiment and the 159th Regiment, in coordination with one battalion of the puppet army Wei Ansheng's unit, totaling more than 1,000 people, carrying more than 400 civilian laborers, and launched attacks on our Majiling, Jin'e, Zuoshan, Liudian and other places in three routes to seize wheat. The fierce battle lasted until noon, when they were completely defeated by our army. Currently, in the sixth district of Yangcheng, Yicheng, Fenshui, Fushan and other places, large numbers of militia continue to protect the grain, and self-defense teams have been sent to the border areas to protect the masses' summer harvest. On the 7th, a 4,000-person wheat harvesting team from the second, fourth, and fifth districts of Fushan set off to help the masses in the Gangtou and Fuyu River border areas of the first and third districts, where the wheat is ripe, to rush the harvest. This year, under the active actions of the masses, the protection of the wheat harvest in the entire region is expected to be victorious.
