    Kuomintang Reactionaries Driven Mad
    Wantonly Bombing Our Yongnian Soldiers and Civilians
    Supporting puppet troops, deliberately provoking civil war. We have lodged a serious protest. If it is not resolved reasonably, we will take necessary and appropriate measures to punish the challengers.
    [This newspaper, Yongnian, 7th] The Kuomintang reactionaries, destroying peace and provoking civil war, sent planes to bomb peaceful soldiers and civilians outside Yongnian city, resulting in 33 deaths and injuries. All 250,000 people of Yongnian and the local garrison are extremely indignant at this atrocity by the Kuomintang. It is reported that at 3:00 PM on June 5th, aircraft No. 272, 0-51272, of the 102nd Squadron of the Air Transport Brigade of the Aviation Committee of the Kuomintang, based in Beiping Nanyuan, came to Yongnian to deliver military uniforms (7 packages, 120 sets per package, and 8 packages of leggings) and bread (28 packages in total) to the puppet troops in the city. During the second drop, one package of military uniforms got caught on the tail of the aircraft, preventing it from maneuvering. It was forced to land in a wheat field near Mazhuang, about eight li northeast of Yongnian city. The pilot, Lu Cheng, Xue Yuan, the chief mechanic, Meng Fuyu, the radio operator, Zhang Tong, and eight soldiers responsible for dropping the packages were injured due to the excessive shaking of the aircraft. Our garrison immediately went to rescue them, provided proper medical treatment, and escorted them to the Handan Military Region Hospital. For the damaged aircraft, Major Han Xizhou and several soldiers were assigned to guard it. Unexpectedly, the Kuomintang reactionaries, driven mad, deliberately undermining peace and engaging in civil war, sent two fighter planes at 1:30 PM on June 6th, to strafe with machine guns and drop a large number of bombs on the peaceful residents harvesting wheat in the fields and the Eighth Route Army soldiers guarding the aircraft. The machine gun shell casings included "LC43," "DM43," and "TW43." Twenty-eight of our peaceful residents, including Lü Chunmin, were injured or killed. Seven, including Ye Yongquan, died immediately due to severe injuries. Five of the garrison personnel responsible for guarding the aircraft were injured, one of whom has died. Major Han Xizhou suffered three injuries and is currently groaning in pain in bed. When the reporter visited him on the morning of the 7th, Major Han, enduring the pain, recounted the rescue of the Kuomintang aircraft and said: "We kindly rescued the injured pilots and guarded the damaged aircraft day and night, but the Kuomintang reactionaries had no conscience and opened fire with machine guns and bombed us. Most of the 28 dead and wounded people were not near the crashed aircraft. I personally saw the wife of Ma Yusheng from Shangmatou and Feng Shezi, a thirteen-year-old from Fengyan Village, being strafed to death by Kuomintang aircraft in places far away from the crashed aircraft. This proves that the Kuomintang reactionaries' killing of Yongnian soldiers and civilians was a planned offensive action." The representative of the Communist Party in the flight team lodged a serious protest with the Kuomintang authorities against the Kuomintang reactionaries' attack on peaceful residents and CCP troops in Yongnian, and sent a memorandum to the US and Kuomintang representatives on June 7th, firmly demanding: (1) Telegraph the Beiping Executive Headquarters to order the CCP troops to dissolve and surrender the puppet troops in Yongnian city. (2) Telegraph the Beiping Executive Headquarters to investigate the responsibility for the aircraft that bombed and strafed peaceful residents and CCP troops in Yongnian on June 6th, punish them, and immediately stop using aircraft to transport supplies to support the puppet troops in Yongnian city. (3) Compensate the losses of the dead and wounded soldiers and civilians and provide pensions to the dead and wounded and their families. (4) In the future, if there are any more aircraft flying over Yongnian, our soldiers and civilians will resolutely take self-defense measures.
