Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: The Kuomintang fascist faction, disregarding the people's opposition, is determined to implement the "Police District System" and will extend it from Shanghai to Peiping and Chongqing. According to reports in the Shanghai United Evening News and other publications in mid-May, within the "Police District," regardless of gender, age, or status, everyone is included in a "record card" system, with each person having a card that is monthly divided into blue, white, and red. Government officials and Kuomintang members receive blue cards, and police officers do not need to "visit" them and must respect them, providing various conveniences (meals, lodging, opening courtyards). White cards are used for those who will be "visited" once a month. Those who should be registered with red cards include frequent travelers, those who have many guests, those who like to talk, those suspected of being "communist bandits," those who participate in democratic activities, those who socialize widely... and more than twenty other types. The police are to "visit" them on time. If they are deemed "problematic," they can be sent to the bureau for investigation. Furthermore, according to the United Evening News on May 25th, Xuan Tie-wu, the Shanghai Police Chief, told reporters that the three-color card system must be implemented. He stated that the "Police District System" will initially have 8,000 police officers, which will later be increased to 15,000. Shanghai newspapers also reported that the Shanghai Municipal Government spends over 800 trillion yuan annually on the "Police District System." Moreover, according to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 4th of this month, Interior Minister Zhang Li-sheng told reporters that the treatment of these police officers is equivalent to that of low-ranking appointed officials and equated the "Police District System" with the "beat" system of British and American police patrolling designated areas. The "beat" system involves "police officers patrolling their designated areas to prevent theft and protect residents' safety, but they must not casually enter homes and conduct searches." According to an article published by Shanghai Police Chief Xuan Tie-wu in the News Daily on the 11th of last month, explaining the "Police District System," he stated: "Residents' freedom is not absolute freedom... it can be intruded upon and searched."

    实行警察特务统治
    所耗经费年在八十万万元以上
    【新华社延安七日电】国民党法西斯派，不顾人民反对，坚决实行“警管区制”，并将由上海推广至平，渝各地。据上月中旬沪联合晚报等刊载：“警管区”内，无分男女老幼，概编入“记录卡”，每人一卡，卡月分蓝白红三色。政府官员、国民党员等由蓝卡，警员对它不必“访问”，且需尊敬，及给予种种便利（吃饭、睡觉、开院子）。用白卡，每月“访问”一次。应登入红卡的人，计有常出外者、多客者、爱说话者、有“奸匪嫌疑”者、参加民主活动者，广交游者………等等二十余种，警察准时“访问”。如认为“有问题”，即可送局究办。又据联合晚报上月二十五日载：沪警察局长宣铁吾告该报记者称：三色卡片制，必须执行。并谓“警管区制”之警察，暂为八千名，后将增至一万五千名。又据上海各报称：沪市政府用于“警管区制”之经费，年约八十万万以上。复据中央社南京本月四日消息：内政部长张厉生告该社记者称：此项警员之待遇，相当于低级委任官，并将“警管区制”附会为英美警察在指定地区内往返巡逻之“闭特”制度。按“闭特”制度，即“为警察在其巡逻地区内，往来巡逻，防止盗窃行为，保护居民安全，但决不能随便穿堂入室，施行搜查。”又据沪警局长宣铁吾在上月十一日新闻报发表一文，对“警管区制”解释称：“居民自由，并非绝对自由………，可以侵入搜索”。
