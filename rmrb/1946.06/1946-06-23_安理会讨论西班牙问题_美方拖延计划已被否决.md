　　Security Council Discusses Spanish Question
    US Delaying Plan Vetoed
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: AP, New York - On the 18th, the US delaying plan regarding the Spanish question in the Security Council was vetoed by the Soviet representative. After the rejection of this proposal, the Polish representative, Lange, requested a discussion of his original proposal, namely that all UN members should sever relations with Spain. However, he failed to secure a vote on the matter. Furthermore, according to the Central News Agency: On the 13th, the United Nations Economic and Social Council, disregarding the opposition of the representatives of the United States and Britain, passed by a vote of eleven to five the proposal by the Soviet representative that representatives attending various committees under the jurisdiction of the Council should be appointed by their respective governments, and not so-called individuals of the country. The Soviet representative believed that unless the representatives are appointed by their respective governments, the committees would become debating societies.

　　安理会讨论西班牙问题
    美方拖延计划已被否决
    【新华社延安二十日电】美联社纽约讯：十八日安理会关于西班牙问题之美方拖延计划，已被苏联代表所否决。该案否决后，波兰代表兰吉遂要求讨论他的原来建议案，即所有联合国会员，均应与西班牙断绝关系。但未能争取到会议之表决。又据中央社讯：联合国经济社会理事会，十三日不顾美英两国代表之反对，十一票对五票通过苏代表所建议，即出席该理事会管辖下各委会之代表，应系各国政府所委派，非所谓国家之个人。苏代表认为除非各代表系各国政府所委，否则各委员会将变成辩论之社团。
