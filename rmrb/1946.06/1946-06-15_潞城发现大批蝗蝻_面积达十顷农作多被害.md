    【Changzhi News from this newspaper】A large number of locust nymphs have been discovered in Jia Village, Lucheng, covering an area of approximately ten acres. Surrounding millet seedlings and sesame have already been severely damaged. Women and children in the village are intensifying their efforts to capture and kill them, with an average of over 120 nymphs caught per person per day.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 8th】 Locust nymphs and mole crickets have been widely discovered in the Hai'men, Qidong, Rugao, and Taixing areas of the First Sub-district of the Suwan Liberated Area, the Mengqiao area of Huai'an in the Fifth Sub-district and near Xiang＠kou, and the Guanyun, Muyang, Simu, and Tongyang counties of the Sixth Sub-district, damaging seedlings. According to statistics from the Guanyun Construction Bureau, one-third of the county's spring fields have been destroyed. Local governments are actively leading the masses to fight against the insect plague with all their strength. The Special Commissioner's Office has allocated a large amount of grain and instructed each county to eliminate locust nymphs, calling for the exchange of one jin of locust nymphs for half a jin of grain as an incentive. The Huai'an County Government has stipulated that one jin of insects can be exchanged for two jin of grain, with a deadline to quickly curb the insect infestation. According to incomplete statistics, the Zhunian District of Guanyun alone has eliminated more than 10,000 jin of locust nymphs in just a few days. For the affected spring fields, local governments are raising a large amount of seeds to distribute to the masses for replanting, and are calling on the masses to resolutely ensure that not a single mu of land is left uncultivated.
