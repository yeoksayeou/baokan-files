Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 24th: Moscow Dispatch: The material and cultural life of Soviet workers has greatly improved. Regarding improvements in material life: In the past ten months, new housing for workers totaling 2.5 million square meters has been completed. Expenditures on dormitory construction reached 1.6325 billion rubles, and expenditures on individual housing reached 447 million rubles. Soviet workers who suffered persecution by German bandits have all moved from earthen houses into Western-style houses this spring. In the first year of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, nurseries and playgrounds, scout camps, and tuberculosis sanatoriums have been built for workers' children. The Soviet Trade Union will also open 5,000 summer camps in scenic areas this year to accommodate 2 million children in July and August, with 400,000 children going to sanatoriums for recuperation, of which orphans who lost their parents in the war and children of war invalids account for 15 percent. Many factories have facilities for bathhouses, laundry rooms, sewing shops, and various repair shops. The number of sewing shops has increased from 6,300 to 10,200. In recent years, 313,000 rubles have been spent on manufacturing furniture for workers, and 587,000 rubles on tableware.

In order to improve the food for workers, sideline occupations have been greatly developed among workers. Last year, more than 1.8 million workers cultivated 1.5 million Russian acres of land, supplying more than 3.5 million tons of potatoes and vegetables to workers. The Soviet Council of Ministers recently ordered the Ministry of Grain Industry to build several new bread factories in 95 cities and industrial centers, each capable of producing 3,000 tons and 630,000 tons of bread daily.

The budget for national social insurance has increased substantially year by year. In 1945, it increased by 1.5 million rubles compared to 1940, and by 2 million rubles compared to 1944, all of which were used to expand recreational and sanatorium facilities to ensure the health of workers. The Trade Union has worked hard to restore recreational facilities and sanatoriums. On New Year's Day 1944, 108 recreational facilities and sanatoriums had begun operation. By October 1945, the number of sanatoriums had increased to 416, and the number of workers receiving treatment in these facilities had also increased from 250,000 to 750,000. This year, sanatoriums will accommodate 400,000 people, and recreational facilities will accommodate 1.1 million people. Among the sanatoriums opened this year, 10,000 beds are specifically designated for war invalids. The Trade Union also pays attention to disease prevention, sanitation facilities, and the improvement of working conditions. As a result, in the past nine months, the number of workers suffering from illness has decreased by one-third compared to the same period last year, thereby preserving one million working days. The Trade Union pays special attention to the health of mothers and children, and medical facilities for young people.

In terms of cultural life, the Trade Union has established 4,500 clubs and cultural palaces, 1,300 radio stations, 30,000 red corners (small clubs), many cinemas and libraries. In 1945, the Trade Union spent more than 100 million rubles on cultural undertakings. 42,000 extracurricular classes have been organized in clubs, cultural palaces, and red corners, where 559,000 people study music, dance, and other subjects.
