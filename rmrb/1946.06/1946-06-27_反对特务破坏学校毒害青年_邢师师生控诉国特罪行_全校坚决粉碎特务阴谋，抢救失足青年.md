　　[Report from our newspaper in Xingtai] The conspiracy of Kuomintang special agents to sabotage the Xingtai Public Normal School, which came to light after more than 200 students were discovered to have been poisoned last month (as reported previously), has aroused serious vigilance among the teachers and students of the entire school. Recently, through current affairs education and various efforts, the special agents' sabotage conspiracy has been completely exposed, and in the frank confession and rescue movement, many misguided youths who had been deceived have been rescued. The teachers and students of Xingtai Normal School have issued a "Letter to Compatriots of All Circles," accusing the Kuomintang agents of their conspiracy crimes: It turns out that when Japan surrendered last year, a portion of the traitors and Kuomintang special agents from the puppet army and puppet organizations openly put up the signboard of the Kuomintang Party Headquarters in Xingtai City, using the bait of promotion and wealth to lure young students to join the Three People's Principles Youth League (Sanqing Tuan), actually carrying out special agent sabotage activities. After we liberated Xingtai City, they assigned these special agents sabotage tasks. According to刘保林, a member who was deceived, when Xingtai was liberated, the special agent organization told them to "continue to stay in school and do work to sabotage the school, and in the future, they will be restored to their official positions." They also gave 刘保林 a large package of poison, telling him to sneak into Xingtai Normal School and release the poison. If the matter was successful, he would be given 100,000 yuan, and threatened him with a pistol: "If you don't complete the task, I'll take your head." Students 罗贤修, 郭瑛, and others also received orders from the special agent organization to sabotage Xingtai Normal School. Their method of operation was to first instruct backward students to secretly urinate and defecate in classrooms and auditoriums, and then spread the word widely, saying that it was done by students from the Taihang Mountains, thereby provoking the unity between students from the newly liberated areas and the old liberated areas. In the autumn, before it was cold, they clamored that it was cold, saying that the school did not care about the students' warmth, and used this as an excuse to organize backward students to burn desks and benches to keep warm, burning more than 300 pieces in total, worth about 140,000 yuan. Under their unified plan, 章恒寿 and 崔佩玉 (one of the heads of the new branch of the Sanqing Tuan), who were in charge of the library, "lost" more than 500 books and attempted to pile up rotten paper and burn down the library. They also damaged a stethoscope and broke more than 100 pieces of glass. 罗贤修 systematically "recommended" 刘保林 as the economic committee member, whose task was to "sabotage the kitchen," such as deliberately paying more for vegetables, asking the cooks to cook more food, throwing away what they couldn't eat, and leading the way in banging bowls. 刘保林 confessed: "There are countless things that have been damaged and wasted by burning benches to bake steamed buns." When the Democratic Nation-Building College enrolled students, they mobilized Xingtai Normal School students to "prepare to go there to sabotage," defrauding more than 60 people. 罗贤修 fabricated 42 "charges" against Principal Wang and secretly plotted to tie up Principal Wang for a demonstration and petition, and then still supported the traitor Principal 苏世忠, who had embezzled more than 2 million yuan in school funds, to take the stage. They absorbed the vagrant youth 高吉太 as a member of the Sanqing Tuan, letting 高勾搭 collude with female students to jointly sabotage the school. They ordered the cook 王文彬 (head of the new branch of the Sanqing Tuan) to set fire to six houses at the end of April, causing the students to eat in the open air, and they took the opportunity to spread the word: "Even the kitchen is gone, go home!" Since May, the Kuomintang reactionaries have stepped up their launching of the civil war, and the Kuomintang special agent organization has sent a large batch of poison from Anyang, with the order to "give 10,000 yuan for poisoning one person to death," which is the inside story of the poisoning of more than 200 students at Xingtai Normal School that was reported some time ago. After recounting the Kuomintang special agent policy that caused all these conspiracies to sabotage, set fires, and poison people, the article finally issued a painful appeal, resolutely opposing the Kuomintang authorities' special agent policy of poisoning young people, demanding that the democratic government of the liberated areas eliminate the Kuomintang special agent organizations, demanding that people from all walks of life work together to rescue the errant youth trapped in the well, calling on the errant youth to wake up, extricate themselves, save themselves, start anew, no longer do things that are harmful to nature and reason and violate conscience, and no longer be tools for the Kuomintang reactionaries to massacre the people.

　　反对特务破坏学校毒害青年
    邢师师生控诉国特罪行
    全校坚决粉碎特务阴谋，抢救失足青年
    【本报邢台讯】国民党特务破坏邢台公立师范学校的阴谋活动，自上月二百余同学发现中毒后（已志前报），即引起全校师生的严重警惕。最近经过时事教育和各种努力，特务破坏阴谋被完全揭露，并在坦白挽救运动中，抢救出不少失足上当青年。邢师全体师生，顷特发表“告各界同胞书”，控诉国特阴谋罪行：原来在去年日本投降时，伪军伪组织中一部分汉奸、国民党特务，就在邢市公开挂起了国民党党部的招牌，用升官发财等钓饵利诱青年学生参加三青团，实际进行特务破坏活动。我解放邢市后，他们即给这些特务布置了破坏任务。据上当分子刘保林说，邢台解放时，特务机关叫他们“继续留校，做破坏学校的工作，将来官复原职。”并给了刘保林一大包毒药，叫他潜入邢师放毒，事成之后，给十万元，又以手枪威胁：“如果完不成任务，要你脑袋。”还有学生罗贤修、郭瑛等也同样接受了特务机关破坏邢师的命令，他们的活动方式，开始指示落后同学，偷往教室、礼堂里大小便，回头就大肆宣传，说是太行山来的同学干的，借此挑拨新解放区与老解放区来的同学的团结。去秋天尚未冷时，他们就嚷着冷了，说学校不关心同学冷暖，借此组织落后同学烧桌椅板凳来烤火，前后烧毁三百多件，约值十四万元。在他们统一计划下，管图书的章恒寿和崔佩玉（三青团新支部负责人之一）“遗失”图书五百多部，并企图堆集烂纸，烧毁图书馆。又毁坏听诊器一个，摔破玻璃百余块，罗贤修有计划的“保举”刘保林为经济委员，任务是“破坏厨房”。如买菜故意多出钱，叫伙夫多做饭，吃不了扔掉，领着头敲碗等。刘保林坦白说：“烧着凳子烤馒头，损坏和浪费了的东西不计其数。”民主建国学院招生时，他们动员邢师同学“准备到那里去破坏”，共骗走六十多名。罗贤修捏造了王校长四十二条“罪状”，密谋捆起王校长示威请愿，然后仍拥护贪污校款二百多万的汉奸校长苏世忠上台。他们吸收浪荡青年高吉太为三青团员，让高勾搭女同学，共同破坏学校。叫炊事员王文彬（三青团新支部负责人）于四月底放火烧了六间房子，害得同学们在露天吃饭，他们乘机宣传：“连厨房也没啦，回家吧！”五月以来，国民党反动派加紧发动内战，国民党特务机关从安阳送来大批毒药，命令是“毒死一个给一万元”，这就是前些时报载邢师二百多同学中毒的内幕。该文于历述国民党特务政策所造成的这一切阴谋破坏放火放毒的滔天罪行之后，最后发出沉痛的呼号，坚决反对国民党当局毒化青年的特务政策，要求解放区民主政府肃清国民党特务机关，要求各界人士共同协力，拯救陷井中的失足青年，号召失足青年猛省，自拔自救、重新做人，不再做伤天害理，违背良心的罪恶勾当，不再做国民党反动派屠杀人民的工具。
