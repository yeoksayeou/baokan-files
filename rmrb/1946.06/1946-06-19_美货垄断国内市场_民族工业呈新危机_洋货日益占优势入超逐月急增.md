Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: Foreign goods are monopolizing the domestic market, and a new crisis for national industry has begun. According to the Chongqing Democratic Daily of May 21st, Mr. Wu Yun Chu's Tianchu MSG factory is finding it increasingly impossible to sustain itself due to the dumping of American "Wei Guo" MSG on the market. The China Chef King, the Mei Lin Company, is facing the irresistible threat of American "XBLn" milk powder, causing its Mei Lin condensed milk and other products to have no sales. For the same reason, another national industrial plant, the Sin Yi Pharmaceutical Factory, is finding it increasingly difficult to maintain profits. However, in order to struggle and compete with foreign goods, they have to spend a huge sum of 100 million yuan on advertising every month.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: Recently, foreign goods have been increasingly dominant. According to customs figures published in Kuomintang-controlled newspapers last month: in the first quarter of this year, import and export figures showed that the import surplus in January reached 370 million yuan, with imports being 1.7 times the value of exports. In February, the import surplus increased to 1.18 trillion yuan, with imports being 4.6 times the value of exports. March saw a further increase, with the import surplus reaching 1.38 trillion yuan, and imports being 10 times the value of exports. In terms of import surplus, March was more than nine times that of January.

    美货垄断国内市场
    民族工业呈新危机
    洋货日益占优势入超逐月急增
    【新华社延安十五日电】洋货垄断国内市场，民族工业的新危机已经开端。据渝民主报五月二十一日载：民族工业家吴蕴初氏的天厨味精厂，已为市上美货“味果”的倾销，使该厂日益无法撑持。中国缺馔大王梅林公司，由于美货“ＸＢＬｎ”奶粉的不可抵抗的威胁，该厂梅林淡奶及其他出品，没有了销路。同样原因，使民族工业的另一厂，信谊制药厂，日益不能维持利润。但为了要挣扎向外货竞赛，每月广告费，还不得不支出一万万元的巨数。
    【新华社延安十五日电】进日洋货日益占压倒优势。据上月间国民党区报纸所载海关数字：今年第一季进出口数字，今年一月份入超达三十七万万元，入口为出口之一点七倍。二月份入超增至一百一十八万万元，入口为出口之四点六倍。三月尤增，入超达一百三十八万万元，入口竟为出口之十倍。以入超言，三月份即达一月份九倍以上。
