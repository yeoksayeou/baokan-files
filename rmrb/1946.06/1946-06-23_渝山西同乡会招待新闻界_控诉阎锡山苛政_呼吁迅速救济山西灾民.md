Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th - According to the Chongqing Democratic Daily, the Shanxi Fellow-Provincials Association hosted a press conference in Chongqing at the Youth Association Hall at 2:00 PM on April 30th. The association's chairman, Jing Guohua, reported on the suffering of the people of Shanxi since the victory and the various tyrannical policies of Yan Xishan in his controlled areas. (1) Military aspects: Since the victory against Japan, Yan Xishan entered Taiyuan. In order to utilize the Japanese army, he has not disarmed the Japanese army, held a surrender ceremony, or sent the Japanese army back to Japan. All military and political personnel only talk about peace with Japan, not about the surrender of the Japanese army. The puppet troops are all reorganized into the "National Army," with an estimated 140,000 enemy and puppet troops being reorganized. He also formed the "Conspiracy Society" in conjunction with the Japanese and puppets, with Japanese and puppets serving as important personnel in the society, poisoning the people. Recently, in the Pingyao County area, the Japanese army was used to go to the countryside to collect grain. If they are not satisfied, they will shoot and kill people. More than 200 people have been victimized. Recently, he has further implemented the "soldier-peasant integration" policy, forcibly conscripting young men to achieve his expansionist conspiracy. (2) Political aspects: Its central organization is the National Revolutionary Comrades Association, which controls Shanxi's military and political affairs and carries out special tasks. There are already more than 50 of these organizations spread throughout Shanxi. (3) Economic aspects: Yan Xishan has always adopted a controlled policy for Shanxi's economy, and the people are not allowed to freely operate industrial and commercial businesses. Since the victory, he has confiscated enemy and puppet banks and company properties worth approximately 500 billion yuan, all of which are privately owned by Yan Xishan.

Subsequently, Jing made the following demands: (1) Please the government dismiss Yan Xishan from all military and political positions. (2) Immediately abolish all tyrannical policies in Shanxi. (3) Swiftly provide relief to the disaster victims in Shanxi.

    【新华社延安二十日电】重庆民主报载，山西同乡会四月三十日下午二时，假青年会交谊厅招待重庆市新闻界。由该会理事长井国华报告自胜利以来山西民生疾苦，及阎锡山在其统治区各种苛政。（一）军事方面：自抗战胜利以后，阎锡山进入太原，为利用日军起见，迄未解除日军武装、举行受降、遣送日军返日。所有军政人员，只言与日和平，不说日军投降。对伪军则统编为“国军”，估计敌伪改遍军队达十四万。并与日伪联合组织“合谋社”，以日伪充任该社重要人员，荼毒人民。最近平遥县一带即用日军下乡催粮，稍不遂意，即行枪杀人民。人民受害者，已有二百余人。近更厉行“兵农合一”政策，强拉壮丁以遂其扩军阴谋。（二）政治方面：其中心组织即民族革命同志会，统制山西军事政治，执行特殊任务。此种组织遍布于山西各地者，已有五十余单位。（三）经济方面：山西经济阎氏向取统制政策，工商各业不准人民自由经营。自胜利以来，没收敌伪银行公司产业约五千亿元，均归阎锡山私有。
    继而井氏提出要求：（一）请政府革除阎锡山一切军政职务。（二）迅速废除山西一切苛政。（三）迅速救济山西灾民。
