    An Irresistible Force
    -- On the Glorious Uprising in Haicheng
    *Yan'an* Liberation Daily Editorial on the 6th

    The entire body of officers of the Kuomintang Army's 184th Division, led by General Pan Shuoduan, staged a glorious anti-civil war uprising on the front lines in Haicheng. This uprising not only represents the anti-civil war sentiments of the broad masses of soldiers and officers with a sense of justice within the Kuomintang army but also represents the demands of the people across the country for peace and democracy. The glorious uprising in Haicheng is not an isolated event; it is inseparable from the irresistible great force of the nationwide torrent of people from all walks of life opposing civil war and striving for peace and democracy. The glorious uprising in Haicheng once again proves the great power of this irresistible torrent.

    Haven't the fascist reactionaries been constantly portraying their heinous civil war acts in the Northeast as "receiving sovereignty"? However, the uprising officers of the 184th Division, based on their own experiences, exposed the reactionaries' shameless deception. Their solemn declaration of uprising pointed out: "Nominally 'receiving sovereignty,' but in reality, attacking the CPC's armed forces in the Northeast; and as Chinese, using American weapons to wage civil war and kill their own compatriots," "ordering this division to eliminate the CPC's strength and all democratic elements in the southern Manchuria area." This shows that it is the reactionaries themselves who are relying on foreign forces to slaughter the Chinese people, destroy democratic forces, and undermine the sovereignty of the Chinese people. Wasn't Chiang Kai-shek constantly talking about "stabilizing order" and "prospering the Northeast" in his speeches in Shenyang and other places? However, the officers and soldiers of the 184th Division also saw through these lies, and they accused the reactionaries of the endless disasters that the civil war has brought to the people of the Northeast. "The front line extends for thousands of miles, and wherever the artillery fire reaches, houses are turned into ruins, and people are displaced, while the national army's levies and demands are as urgent as shooting stars." It turns out that it is the reactionaries themselves who are destroying social order and plunging the people of the Northeast into dire straits. The solemn declaration of the officers of the 184th Division fully exposes the anti-national, anti-people, and anti-democratic counter-revolutionary essence of the civil war waged by the Kuomintang authorities in the Northeast and other places. Precisely because of this, the uprising of all officers and soldiers of the 184th Division is completely correct, just, and glorious!

    The Haicheng uprising is a serious blow and a strong warning to the reactionaries who are frantically waging civil war. Not only the broad masses of people and all peace-loving democrats across the country oppose your civil war crimes, but also within the Kuomintang army, there are many who oppose your crimes. This includes not only the broad masses of soldiers and junior officers but also middle and senior officers who are unwilling to slaughter their compatriots and support peace and democracy. The reactionaries can use foreign weapons to equip their troops and transport them to the civil war front lines; however, when the officers and soldiers of these troops come into contact with the powerful people's armed forces, when they see through the reactionaries' deception and suddenly awaken, they will inevitably "escape from the sea of suffering" and stand on the side of the people, turning their weapons to oppose civil war and dictatorship and defend peace and democracy. We can say with certainty that if the reactionaries do not pull back from the brink and continue to persist in civil war and expand civil war, then along with the nationwide anti-civil war torrent, many General Gao Shuxuns and General Pan Shuoduans will appear in the Kuomintang army!

    The Haicheng uprising is a resounding call to all officers and soldiers who have been driven by the Kuomintang reactionaries to the civil war front lines as cannon fodder. It calls on them to learn from the example of Generals Gao Shuxun, Pan Shuoduan, and others, and raise the banner of anti-civil war! Hundreds of millions of people in China will extend countless hands to welcome them and support them, just as they warmly welcomed Generals Gao and Pan and their troops!

    Long live General Pan Shuoduan and all the officers and soldiers of the Haicheng uprising!

    不可抗拒的力量
    ——论海城光荣起义
    延安解放日报六日社论
    国民党军一八四师全体官员，在师长潘朔端将军率领之下，在海城火线上举行光荣的反内战起义。这一起义，不仅代表了国民党军队中广大士兵群众与有正义感的军官的反对内战的情绪，而且也代表了全国人民的和平民主的要求。海城的光荣起义，并不是孤立的事件，它是和全国各阶层人民反对内战，争取和平民主的洪流分不开的。海城的光荣起义，再一次证明了这一洪流不可抗拒的伟大力量。
    法西斯反动派不是口口声声把他们在东北的罪恶内战行为，描写为“接收主权”吗？但一八四师的起义官员，根据他们的切身经验，揭破了反动派的无耻欺骗。他们的庄严的起义宣言指出：“名曰‘接收主权’，实为进攻中共在东北之武装；且身为中国人，而使用美国武器，进行内战，残杀自己同胞”，“命令本师肃清南满地区的中共实力及一切民主分子”。这说明依靠外力屠杀中国人民，摧残民主力量，破坏中国人民的主权的，正是反动派自己。蒋介石在沈阳等地演说，不是口口声声说要“安定秩序”“繁荣东北”吗？但是，一八四师的官兵也看穿了这种鬼话，他们控诉了反动派进行内战所给予东北人民带来的无穷灾难。“战线延长数千里，炮火所及，庐舍为墟，人民流离失所，而国军之征敛催索，仍急如星火”。原来破坏社会秩序，使东北人民陷于水深火热的境地者，也正是反动派自己。一八四师官员的庄严宣言，充分暴露了国民党当局在东北和其他各地所进行的内战的反民族、反人民、反民主的反革命本质。也正因为如此，一八四师全体官兵的起义，是完全正确的，是正义的和光荣的！
    海城起义，对于正在疯狂地进行内战的反动派，是一个严重的打击，也是一个有力的警告。不但全国广大群众和一切和平民主人士，反对你们的内战罪行；而且在国民党军队内，反对你们这种罪行的，也大有人在。这不仅包括广大的士兵群众和下级军官，而且也包括不愿屠杀同胞赞成和平民主的中级和高级军官。反动派可以用外国武器装备自己的军队，运到内战火线上去；但是，当这些军队的官兵与强大的人民武装接触之后，当他们看穿反动派欺骗，恍然醒悟之后，他们必然要“脱离苦海”，站到人民方面来，把手中的武器，转过来反对内战独裁，保卫和平民主。我们可以肯定地说，如果反动派再不悬崖勒马，继续坚持内战，扩大内战，那末和全国人民的反内战洪流一起，国民党军队里面将会出现许多的高树勋将军与潘朔端将军！
    海城起义，对于一切被国民党反动派驱迫到内战火线上当炮灰的军官和士兵们，是一个响亮号召。它号召他们学习高树勋、潘朔端等将军的榜样，举起反内战的义旗！全中国成千成万的人民，会像热烈欢迎高、潘二将军及其所部一样，伸出无数双的手欢迎他们做他们的后盾！
    海城起义的潘朔端将军及全体官兵万岁！
