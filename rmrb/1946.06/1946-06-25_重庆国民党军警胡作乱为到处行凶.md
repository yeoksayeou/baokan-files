　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 21st: Chongqing sources report that the Kuomintang military police here have recently become increasingly reckless, committing atrocities everywhere. On May 30th, a shocking bloodbath occurred in Beibei, where police officers killed and arrested over twenty students. The incident remains unresolved. The school authorities have filed a serious protest with the Beibei Administration, and merchants in Beibei have been on strike since May 30th in protest, which continued through June 2nd. Students from various schools are also gathering to discuss further action. Since May, there have been more than ten cases, large and small, of soldiers committing violence. The most egregious include the destruction of the Peiyu School and the Guanyinyan Central Elementary School on May 15th. On May 12th, hundreds of soldiers destroyed the Shengping Cinema, injuring three workers and causing losses of over five million yuan. On May 24th, two incidents occurred in one day: at Xiaolongkan Zhongzheng Middle School, because the school refused to allow troops to enter to watch a movie, the school was destroyed by over a hundred members of the military officer corps, injuring eleven teachers and students; the other was the Xiangguoshi ferry disaster, and four days later, personnel from the Ministry of Military Administration, because they didn't buy tickets, gathered a mob and destroyed a boat belonging to the Minsheng Company, resulting in three boatmen missing.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 21st: Following Shanghai and Chongqing, which have begun implementing the "Police District System," the Kuomintang authorities in Tianjin are now secretly implementing the "Police District System." In April, a large number of secret agents transported from Xi'an and Chongqing were assigned as "police officers," with each officer in charge of 60-70 households, approximately 400-500 people. Kaifeng, Henan, has also implemented this fascist system, and it is rumored that it will soon be implemented throughout the province.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 21st: Shanghai sources report that the Shanghai *News* bi-monthly, which has a large readership, was forcibly shut down by reactionaries in late May. Xuan Tie Wu's "handwritten order," the Shanghai police chief, added the so-called "crime" of "insulting the Party and the State." The publication has requested the magazine association to negotiate with the authorities. The publication had released fourteen issues before being banned.

　　重庆国民党军警胡作乱为到处行凶
    【新华社延安二十一日电】渝讯：此间国民党军警近来益形胡作乱为，到处行凶。上月三十日北碚发生了吓人听闻的警察大批杀伤与逮捕学生二十余人的大血案，至今未予解决，现该校当局，已向北碚管理局提出严重抗议，北碚商民亦于三十日起罢市，以示抗议，迄六月二日尚在继续。各校学生亦纷纷集议，准备有所表示。自五月以来，军人行凶事件，大小不下十数起，其荦荦大者，如五月十五日捣毁培育学校及观音岩中心小学。十二日更有数百军人，捣毁升平电影院事发生，影院工人三人受伤，损失在五百万元以上。二十四日一日竟发生两起：一为小龙坎中正中学，因未允驻军入校看电影，致遭军官总队百余人捣毁，师生十一人受伤；另一即为香国市渡头大惨案，四天后，军政部人员又因乘船不购船票，且聚众捣毁民生公司船只，结果船工三人失踪。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】继沪、渝两地开始实行“警管区制”后，天津国民党当局现正秘密实行“警管区制”。四月内，由西安、重庆运来之大批特务已被派担任“警察”，每一警察管辖六七十户，约四五百人。河南开封亦已实施这一法西斯制度，闻不久将普及全省。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】沪讯：拥有大量读者的上海《消息》半月刊，于上月下旬已被反动派强迫停刊。沪市警察局长宣铁吾之“手谕”，对该刊加以所谓“侮辱党国”之“罪”名。现该刊已请杂志界联谊会向当局提出交涉。按该刊至被封时，共出十四期。
