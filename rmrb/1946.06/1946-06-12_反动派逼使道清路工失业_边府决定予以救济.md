    Reactionaries Force Daoqing Railway Workers into Unemployment
    Border Government Decides to Provide Relief
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Due to the constant attacks by the Kuomintang reactionaries on our Yubei Liberated Area, transportation cannot be restored quickly, causing more than 180 Daoqing Railway workers to be unable to resume work soon, and their four to five hundred family members are experiencing extreme hardship. The railway workers' union and all unemployed workers recently sent a letter to Yang and Rong, the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, accusing the Kuomintang reactionaries of their crimes and requesting relief. The original letter stated: "We hate! We hate the Kuomintang reactionaries for destroying peace and violating the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, making us unable to find work and turning us into unemployed workers." Then, they said very gratefully: "The democratic government has repeatedly provided relief to us, the trade union has helped us open cooperatives, and the workers in the Jiaozuo mining area have donated a lot of money to us, solving many problems." However, the lives of all the unemployed workers are still very difficult, so they request the democratic government to help solve this problem by establishing a management bureau or a resumption-of-work committee, issuing living allowances or appropriately paying wages, opening weaving factories and ironware factories to develop production for self-salvation, and the government investing to help, etc., and providing relief to the families of the deceased workers and those who are unable to live. The Border Government has now responded to their demands. The Construction Department has also conducted an investigation and is actively trying to solve the difficulties of these workers.

    反动派逼使道清路工失业
    边府决定予以救济
    【本报消息】由于国民党反动派不断向我豫北解放区进攻，交通不能早日恢复，致道清路一百八十余位铁路工人，不能早日复业，四五百口家属，生活极为困难，该铁路职工会，及全体失业工人，顷致函晋冀鲁阎边区杨、戎正副主席，控诉国民党反动罪恶，要求救济，原函中说：“我们恨！恨国民党反动派破坏和平，破坏政协决议，使我们无业可就，使我们成了失业工人”。接着他们又非常感激的说：“民主政府曾数次救济过我们，工会帮助我们开合作社，焦作矿区工友捐助了我们不少的款，解决了不少问题”。但是全部失业工人的生活，仍很困难，因此他们要求民主政府予以帮助解决，成立管理局或复工委员会，发给生活补助费或酌发工资，开织布厂、铁货厂，发展生产自救，政府投资帮助等，对死难的工友家属和无能力生活的予以救济。现边府已答复他们的要求。建设厅并进行了调查，正积极设法解决这些工人的困难。
