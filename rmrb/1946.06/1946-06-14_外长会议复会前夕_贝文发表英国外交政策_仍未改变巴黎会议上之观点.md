Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 11th: London dispatch: On the eve of the resumption of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, British Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a lengthy speech in the House of Commons on the 4th, focusing on issues related to the Foreign Ministers' Conference, outlining British foreign policy. In presenting the "world problems that must be resolved" at present, Bevin considered them to be much more complex than in 1919, but expressed that he was not pessimistic. Bevin said: It is necessary to "achieve agreement between the West and the Greater Slavic region," "because only with Russia's free participation in the solution of European problems can lasting peace on the European continent be guaranteed." Bevin demanded international navigation on the Danube, explicitly calling for the "open door principle" on the Danube. On the Italian-South border and the Trieste issue, Bevin had no new opinions. On the Austrian issue, Bevin believed it must be resolved immediately. Bevin recounted Britain's past handling of Italian colonies in North Africa, and defended Britain's "Greater Somaliland Plan" on economic grounds. But this time Bevin said: "If everyone dislikes Britain's proposal, Britain is prepared to place Italian Somaliland under UN trusteeship." Bevin spoke most about the German issue. He praised the American 25-year plan, advocating that the Four-Power Commission's investigation into the actual disarmament of Germany should be extended to all four occupation zones. Regarding the peace conference issue, Bevin reiterated his support for Benes' opinion, "If an agreement cannot be reached among the four Foreign Ministers, then we should hand the work over to the 21-nation conference." But Bevin added that he would make one more effort to reach an agreement before making a final decision. In his concluding remarks, Bevin pointed out: "I do not believe that it is impossible to reach a unanimous agreement at the next meeting of foreign ministers, and there are no truly insurmountable differences." But Bevin then said: "I cannot promise that the next meeting will definitely be successful."

In the continued debate on the 5th, Conservative Party leader Churchill rehashed his old tune of anti-Soviet, anti-communist sentiment and sowing discord among the three powers, and demanded that the Labour Party have "formal contact" with him on foreign policy issues. Attlee followed Churchill, stating that Britain was willing to understand Russia and its history, believing that "unity and mutual understanding with the Soviet Union is an urgent need for the world today." He stated that he "couldn't do anything" about the anti-Soviet clamor of certain British newspapers and the likes of Churchill, because "they have freedom."

    外长会议复会前夕
    贝文发表英国外交政策
    仍未改变巴黎会议上之观点
    【新华社延安十一日电】伦敦讯：际此外长会议复会之前夕，英外相贝文于四日在下院以有关外长会议诸问题为中心，发表关于外交政策的长篇演说。贝文在提出目前“所必需解决的世界问题”时，认为较之一九一九年复杂得多，但他表示并不悲观。贝文说：必须使“西方与大斯拉夫地区之间获得协议”，“因为只有俄国自由地参加欧洲问题的解决，欧洲大陆上永久和平才可能有所保证”。贝文要求多瑙河国际通航，他明白不讳的要求在多瑙河实行“门户开放的原则”。意南边界与的里雅斯特问题，贝文没有新的意见。奥地利问题，贝文认为必须立予解决。贝文历述英国过去对北菲意国殖民地的处理方案，并以经济的理由为英国的“大索马利兰计划”辩护。但此次贝文说：“如果大家不喜欢英国建议的话，英国准备使意属索马利兰交联合国托管”。贝文对德国问题发言最多，他赞扬美国的二十五年计划，主张四强委员会关于德国实际解除武装情况的调查，应普及于四个占领区。关于和会问题，贝文再次表明附和贝纳斯意见，“如果在四强外长间不能达到协议，那是我们应该把工作交给二十一国会议”。但贝文又表示，在作最后抉择之前，他将再作一次协议的努力。贝文在结语中指陈：“我不认为外长下次集会时，不可能达到一致协议的结论，并没有真正不可克服的分歧”。但贝文接着又说：“不能约许下次会议一定成功”。
    五日继续辩论中，保守党头子邱吉尔则又重弹反苏反共及挑拨三强团结之烂调，并要求工党在外交问题上与其“正式接触”。艾德礼继邱吉尔发言，表示英国愿意了解俄国及其历史，认为与苏“团结一致，互相了解，这是今日世界之急需”。他声明他对于英国若干报纸及邱吉尔辈之反苏叫嚣“没有办法”，因为“它们有自由”。
