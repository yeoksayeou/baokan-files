    [This Newspaper Yangcheng News] The Taiyue Military Committee General Assembly, on the 10th, once again called on the militia and self-defense forces in the entire region to further strengthen the wheat harvest struggle and overcome the underestimation of the work of defending the harvesting and storing of wheat. The call first pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's troops in the Tongpu Railway and northern Henan and other places, have begun frantically seizing wheat, and our local militia self-defense forces have also launched a grain protection struggle. This is very good, but according to our understanding, some areas do not have sufficient understanding and preparation for the grain protection struggle, thinking that protecting the wheat harvest is mainly about rushing to harvest, while ignoring the more important work of defending the harvesting and storing of wheat. In fact, the harvesting and storing period will be the time when Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's troops frantically seize wheat. If this concept is not changed ideologically, serious losses will be suffered, and the reactionaries will increase the material conditions for massacring the people in the liberated areas. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize the persistence and arduousness of the grain protection struggle, further organize forces, and strengthen the struggle. The call also pointed out: (1) Improve the command headquarters, universally implement joint village defense, and strengthen the alert zone in the border areas, providing armed cover for the masses to quickly harvest and store. (2) Strengthen sentry reconnaissance activities, and even if unable to stop Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's troops from entering the village to seize wheat, they should be detected as early as possible and transferred in a planned manner. (3) Disperse, transfer, and bury grain. (4) Launch a grain protection explosive movement. The call finally pointed out: The greedy and brutal Kuomintang reactionaries are increasingly expanding the civil war, which has extended to the west side of the Tongpu Railway, and their grain seizure activities will also intensify. It is hoped that all localities will be highly vigilant, rise up in self-defense, and understand that victory and happiness can only be obtained through arduous struggle.

    太岳武委会再次号召民兵
    武装保卫打麦藏麦
    【本报阳城讯】太岳武委会总会，十日再次号召全区民兵自卫队进一步加强麦收斗争，克服轻视保卫打麦藏麦工作，号召首先指出蒋阎军在同蒲线及豫北等地，已开始疯狂的抢麦行动，我各地民兵自卫队也随之展开了护粮斗争，这是非常好的，但根据我们了解，某些地区，对护粮斗争的认识和准备不够充分，认为保卫麦收主要是抢收，而忽视了更重要的保卫打麦藏麦工作，其实打藏时期将是蒋阎军疯狂抢麦的时机，如不从思想上改变这一观念，将会蒙受严重损失，并使反动派增加了屠杀解放区人民的物质条件，因此必须认识护粮斗争的持久性和艰苦性，进一步组织力量，加强斗争，号召又指出：（一）健全指挥部，普遍实行联村联防，加强边沿区警戒地带，武装掩护群众快打快藏。（二）加强岗哨侦察活动，即使无力阻止抢麦的蒋阎军进村，亦应即早发觉，有计划的转移。（三）将粮食分散转移埋藏。（四）展开护粮爆炸运动。号召最后指出：贪婪残暴的国民党反动派，在日益扩大内战，内战已扩展至同蒲线西侧，其抢粮活动亦将随之加剧，务希各地高度警惕奋起自卫，胜利幸福只有艰苦斗争才能得到。
