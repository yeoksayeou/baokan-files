Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 9th: Chahar Province, which has suffered from a prolonged drought, finally received a thorough rain on the 7th. At 2 p.m., dark clouds gathered, and heavy rain poured down for three hours before stopping. Chaigoubao, Huailai, Xinbaoan, Xiahuayuan, Zhangjiakou, and other places have all received thorough rain, soaking the soil to a depth of four or five fingers. The rice seedlings, which had withered in the fields, immediately turned green again. The farmers were overjoyed, clapping their hands and cheering, and prepared seeds and tools overnight to rush replanting. When the drought formed in the province, the local democratic governments led the masses to prevent drought and prepare for famine in a timely manner, repairing canals and digging wells to irrigate approximately 300,000 mu of land. This work is still being expanded. Various localities have also widely used methods such as spot sowing and "dry sowing" (removing the dry topsoil before sowing) to prevent drought and urgently seek to remedy the situation. Shezi Village in the Eighth District of Xuanhua planted 5,000 mu of sloping land in five days, and rushed to plant more than 200,000 mu of land in the middle of the month using "dry sowing" and other methods. With this thorough rain, the large area of dry-sown crops can grow rapidly.

    察哈尔苦旱得透雨
    【新华社宣化九日电】察哈尔省苦旱已久七日始得透雨，下午二时阴云密聚，大雨猛降，历三小时始停。柴沟堡、怀来、新保安、下花园、张家口等地均已获得透雨，入土四五指不等，田野一度枯萎的新秧，即转呈青绿色，农民莫不拍手称庆，连夜准备种子，农具突击补种。当该省旱象形成时，各地方民主政府曾领导群众及时防旱备荒，修渠凿井约溉田三十余万亩，现仍在扩大兴修中。各地并曾广泛使用点播、“旱播”（铲去浮面干土下种）等防旱方法，急谋捕救。宣化八区涉子村五日内即干种了五千余亩坡地，旬中以“旱播”等法抢种了二十余万亩土地，此次得了透雨，大片干种的庄稼即可迅速成长。
