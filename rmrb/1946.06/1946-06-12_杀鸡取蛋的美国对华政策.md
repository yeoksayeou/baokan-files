The current U.S. policy towards China, as Mr. Guo Moruo said, is "killing the chicken to get the egg."

The U.S. authorities claim repeatedly that they want to prevent civil war in China and maintain peace, democracy, and unity. U.S. President Truman has made such solemn announcements repeatedly, and Secretary of State Byrnes has also solemnly announced it countless times. The communique of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom in December last year, regarding the China issue, clearly stated: implement democracy, stop internal strife, do not interfere in China's internal affairs, and withdraw Soviet and American troops from China. The U.S. representative signed this solemn agreement, undertaking the sacred obligations of an international treaty.

However, what are the facts? Everyone can see clearly that the United States is mediating the Chinese civil war on the one hand, and actively helping the Kuomintang to conduct a large-scale civil war on the other. Are not the more than 300,000 Kuomintang troops slaughtering the Chinese people in the Northeast all equipped by the United States? Were they not all transported by U.S. naval vessels? Are not the planes, tanks, rocket launchers, etc. they use to savagely slaughter the Chinese people all supplied by the United States? Even the gasoline used by these Chiang troops' planes and tanks is supplied by the United States. Only the ones pulling the triggers are not Americans, but Chiang's soldiers. However, these soldiers of Chiang's army are still trained by U.S. officers.

Obviously, as long as the U.S. authorities can faithfully implement their promises, can faithfully fulfill the international obligations undertaken by the United States, and stop the transportation and supply of Chiang's troops, the disaster-ridden Chinese people would have long obtained peace, democracy, unity, and unification. Without the support of the United States, the fascists within the Kuomintang would not have the audacity to be so arrogant.

In the past hundred years, the Chinese people have suffered too many disasters. After the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, they shed countless blood, suffered unprecedented pain, and lost countless assets. Although they drove away the Japanese imperialist robber, the Chinese people have not yet achieved national independence, and even continue to be slaughtered by foreign weapons. Chiang's "China" and America's "China" are becoming increasingly indistinguishable. Please look at the current situation of Chiang's "nation": the army is completely reorganized, trained, and equipped by the U.S. "Military Advisory Group," the navy is completely trained and equipped by the United States, the Kuomintang fascist secret service personnel who massacre the people are trained with U.S. participation (Sino-American Special Agent Training Class), industrial transportation is designed by U.S. experts, finance is supported by U.S. loans, major cities and economic centers are guarded by U.S. troops, transportation lines are protected by U.S. troops, the army is transported by other people's warships, and the air force and navy are donated by the United States... Can this be called an independent country? Can this be called complete national sovereignty? Since the withdrawal of the Soviet Red Army from the Northeast, national sovereignty has been completely in the hands of the Chinese people. The Kuomintang fascists' shouting of "takeover" is merely an attempt to seize it from the people and establish a base for anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-Chinese people. It is simply turning the complete sovereignty that belongs to the people back into incomplete sovereignty. Since the Opium War, the interference of imperialism in China's internal affairs, and the suppression of the Chinese people's movement for democracy and freedom by imperialism, has never been so serious in scale as it is today.

The Chinese and American people have a long-standing friendship. The broad masses of the American people express deep sympathy for the Chinese people's movement for national independence and democratic freedom. Many American progressives have sincerely helped and are still sincerely helping the Chinese people. The late President Roosevelt repeatedly voiced his support for the Chinese people's democratic movement. The Chinese people will never forget these good intentions of the American people. However, now a small number of reactionary elements in the United States are undermining these friendships between the Chinese and American people, undermining the Roosevelt policy and the principles in Truman's statement that call for peace and democracy in China and guarantee non-military intervention, and undermining the decisions of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers. They are pursuing an imperialist policy towards China, actively supporting the Kuomintang in carrying out a civil war with towering crimes, attempting to eliminate the Chinese people's democratic movement, and maintain the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship of fascist dark rule.

The Chinese people's tolerance for the U.S.'s policy of killing the chicken to get the egg has reached its highest point. Why? In order to make the American reactionaries repent and see that this path is not feasible. The reason is that the Chinese people are not what they used to be. They have a powerful and invincible force. Whoever wants to eliminate this force might as well hope that the sun rises from the west. However, now a small number of reactionary elements in the United States are still stubbornly clinging to their course, and are continuing to transport Kuomintang troops to the Northeast to slaughter the Chinese people.

The most effective way to stop the Kuomintang fascist warmongers from undermining the ceasefire agreement and conducting a large-scale civil war now is for the people of China and the United States to rise up and demand that the U.S. authorities change their vicious policy of killing the chicken to get the egg towards China, withdraw U.S. troops from China, recall lend-lease materials, and stop transporting and aiding Chiang's army.

### 杀鸡取蛋的美国对华政策

    杀鸡取蛋的美国对华政策
    张仲实
    现在美国对华的政策，正如郭沫若先生所说的，是“杀鸡取蛋”。
    美国当局口口声声说要防止中国内战，保持和平、民主、统一，美国总统杜鲁门先生曾经一再这样庄严的宣布过，国务卿贝纳斯先生，也这样庄严地宣布过多少次。去年十二月苏、美、英三国外长莫斯科会议公报，关于中国问题，曾经这样明白地写着：实行民主，停止内争，不干涉中国内政，撤退在中国的苏、美军队。美国代表在这个庄严的协定上，他签了字，担负了国际条约上的神圣义务。
    可是，事实怎样呢？谁都看得清楚，在一方面担任调解中国内战的是美国，而在另一方面积极帮助国民党进行大规模内战，还是这同一个美国。正在东北屠杀中国人民的三十余万国民党军队，不是全部由美国所装备的吗？不是全部由美国海军船舰载运去的吗？他们用以凶恶的屠杀中国人民的飞机、坦克、火箭炮等，不是全部由美国供给的吗？甚至这些蒋军的飞机、坦克所用的汽油，都是美国供给的，只是扭动枪机的不是美国人，而是蒋军的士兵罢了。但是，蒋军的这些士兵，也还是由美国军官所训练的。
    显然的，只要美国当局能忠实执行他们的诺言，能忠实执行美国所担负的国际义务，制止运输和供给蒋军，多灾多难的中国人民，就早已得到和平、民主、团结、统一了。没有美国的撑腰，国民党内的法西斯分子，是没有胆子那末狂妄的。
    近一百年来，中国人民所受的灾难实在太多了，经过了八年的抗日战争，流了无数的血，受了空前的痛苦，损失了不可计数的资产，虽然把日本帝国主义这个强盗赶走了，但是中国人民却还没有取得民族的独立，甚至还要继续被外国武器所屠杀。蒋记的“中国”与美记的“中国”，越来越分不清了，请看看蒋记“国家”的现状吧：军队完全是由美国的“军事顾问团”整编、训练、装备的，海军是完全由美国训练和装备的，国民党残杀人民的法西斯特务人员，是由美国参加训练（中美特工训练班）的，工业交通是由美国的专家设计的，财政是由美国借款支持的，大都市和经济中心是由美国的军队来驻守的，交通线是由美国的军队保护的，军队是由人家的军舰载运的，空军和海军是由美国赠送的………，这能叫做独立的国家吗？这能叫国家主权完整吗？东北自苏联红军撤退后，国家主权到了完完全全地掌握在中国人民的手里，国民党法西斯派喊叫“接收”云云，不过是想从人民手里夺过来，建立反苏反共反中国人民的基地罢了，不过是全属于人民的完整主权，重新变为不完整罢了。自鸦片战争以来，帝国主义对中国内政之干涉，帝国主义对中国人民争取民主自由运动之压迫，其规模之大，从没有象今日这样严重。
    中美两国人民有着久远的友谊，美国广大的人民对中国人民争取民族独立和民主自由的运动，是表示深切同情的，许多美国进步人士都曾经而且现在还在诚心诚意地帮助中国人民，故总统罗斯福先生对于中国人民的民主运动，也曾经一再予以声援，中国国民对于美国人民的这些好意，都是感谢不忘的。可是，现在美国少数的反动分子，却在破坏着中美两国人民的这些友谊，破坏罗斯福政策、和杜鲁门声明中要求中国和平民主并保证不实行军事干涉的原则，破坏莫斯科三国外长会议的决定。他们对中国实行帝国主义的政策，积极支持国民党进行罪恶滔天的内战，企图消灭中国人民的民主运动，保持国民党一党专政的法西斯黑暗统治。
    中国人民对美国的这种杀鸡取蛋的政策，实在容忍到最高点了，为的什么？为的使美国反动分子能有所悔悟，能看到此路不通。原因是中国人民不比以前了，他有了强大的、不可战胜的力量，谁想要消灭这个力量，无异希望太阳从西边出来。可是，现在美国的少数反动分子，仍执迷不悟，还在继续源源运输国民党军队到东北去屠杀中国人民。
    现在阻止国民党法西斯好战分子破坏停战协定，进行大规模内战的最有效办法，就是中美两国人民起来，要求美国当局改变其对中国的杀鸡取蛋的恶毒政策，撤退在华的美军，收回租借物资，停制载运和助济国民党的军队。
