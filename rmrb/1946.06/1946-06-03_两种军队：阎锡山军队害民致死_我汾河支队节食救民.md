    Two Armies:
    Yan Xishan's Troops Harm the People to Death
    Our Fen River Detachment Saves the People by Conserving Food
    [Fen River Detachment News] The 2nd Battalion of Regiment × of the Fen River Detachment, in this village, is using surplus grain to relieve residents who have been plunged into starvation after being exploited and plundered by the Japanese puppet and Yan Xishan's troops. Among the residents, nine households of orphans, widows, and the weak were without rice to cook, crying every day, on the verge of death. Battalion Commander He and Deputy Battalion Commander Shui were determined to find a way to rescue them. At a general meeting of all soldiers in the battalion, their proposal was unanimously approved by all personnel, and it was immediately decided to save the people by conserving food. Soldier Zhao Shunxi said, "Our love for the people is not just talk, but needs to be put into practice." After the meeting, the 1st Platoon saved twenty-six jin of millet in six days, and the 1st Squad saved four jin of rice by eating one meal of thin porridge. In total, the 4th, 5th, and 6th Companies and the battalion headquarters saved a total of one hundred and forty-five jin of millet, all of which was used to help the local residents. This spirit and action moved all the residents of the village. Old Woman Duan said: "The Eighth Route Army is really good, I will never forget it even after I die." An old man said: "Don't leave, when Yan Xishan's troops come, the people will not be able to survive." (Cheng Bin)
