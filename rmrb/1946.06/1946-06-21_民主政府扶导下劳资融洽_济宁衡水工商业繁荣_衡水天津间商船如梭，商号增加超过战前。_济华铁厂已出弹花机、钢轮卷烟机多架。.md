[Report from this newspaper's Weixian office] Hengshui, one of the four famous cities in southern Hebei, an inland material distribution center, and famous for its "Bai Gan" liquor and "writing brushes," is experiencing increasing industrial and commercial prosperity. The city is located west of the Fuyang River and east of the Pingda Highway, with the well-known Shide Railway also passing through it. Before the war, commerce was extremely developed, with a total of 304 businesses. In 1939, when Hengshui was occupied by the enemy, all businesses were forced to close. After Japan surrendered, the Kuomintang appointed the puppet army leaders Dai Libo and Sun Ziyao as commanders of the 50th Detachment, continuing to devastate the people. As a result, Hengshui's industry and commerce did not change from the enemy's occupation even after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Last December, our army disarmed the puppet army, and the democratic government immediately supported the resumption of business operations, issuing industrial and commercial loans of ten million yuan, grain loans of thirty thousand jin to poor people, and relief loans of four hundred thousand yuan to small vendors and unemployed workers. Businessmen who received loans resumed their businesses one after another. In just five and a half months, the number of businesses in the city increased to 377. In particular, the number of small vendors increased to 400 stalls, far exceeding the pre-war level. Currently, new houses are increasing daily on various streets, and handicrafts are developing rapidly. The number of Bai Gan distilleries, which export in large quantities, has increased to sixteen, and the brush industry has also recovered rapidly. Various iron factories and textile factories have been established one after another. These goods can be transported directly to Tianjin via the Fuyang River. Thanks to the democratic government's protection of shipping, boatmen have gained huge profits. As a result, Tianjin boats have also come to the Fuyang River to transport goods. More than 50 transport boats travel between Hengshui and Tianjin every day. Everywhere along the hundreds of miles of the Fuyang River, you can hear the boatmen singing, "Happy days have arrived!" Now, luxury goods are decreasing daily in Hengshui, and the daily necessities produced by the vast number of farmers are increasing significantly. Items such as mats, coal, and earthenware jars can be bought everywhere, a sign of the increase in new handicrafts serving the people in Hengshui. These industries have won the support of the vast majority of farmers, so raising capital is not a major problem. For example, the two newly established weaving factories have sufficient capital of three million yuan, and the capital of one iron factory that manufactures agricultural implements reaches 1.05 million yuan. Cooperative undertakings are also developing greatly. City residents and small producers are putting their savings into cooperatives. For example, the Grain Cooperative, which was converted from the old Grain Exchange, made a profit of 280,000 yuan in just two months from March to May. At the Hengshui wharf, more than 500 dockworkers, who have lived there for decades, are now also liberated. Under enemy rule, they suffered complete unemployment. Even in the stable pre-war old society, they suffered extra exploitation from merchants and foremen (sending gifts to foremen three times a year), and various miscellaneous taxes often took one-tenth of the workers' hard-earned income. Now, these dockworkers have increased wages and organized the Water and Land Transportation Trade Union to protect the interests of the workers. Each worker can now receive an average of fifteen to twenty jin of millet per day. One worker in Hexi Street, with a family of five, can not only maintain his livelihood but can also save ten jin of millet every day. The fear of unemployment is now a thing of the past for them. All dockworkers have resumed work. One manager said: If it were not for the Kuomintang reactionaries' blockade of the liberated areas and the freight transport on the Fuyang River, it would be even more lively, and the newly reborn Hengshui would be even more prosperous.

Jining City's Stalls Increase Sharply: Peddling Sounds Resound on Both Sides of the Canal

[Report from this newspaper's Heze office] The people's market in Jining City, Dagakou, has shown a vigorous atmosphere in the three months since liberation. As the only market for the city's people, stall vendors are the main backbone of the open-air market and also the reliance of the people's lives. On the west bank of the canal, less than a mile long from above to below Dagakou, and on the opposite bank for the same length, excluding the existing shops, more than 300 new stalls have been set up. The south bank is more prosperous than the north bank, with stalls accounting for four-fifths of the total. Among the 300-plus stalls, more than 170 are native cloth stalls, piled with various kinds of native cloth. There are also more than 50 foreign cloth stalls. There are also many stalls selling native knitted socks, woolen cloth, cloth shoes, straw hats, soap, cigarettes, tea, etc., among which knitted socks and soap are the most numerous. After this market rose, the business of the small vendor sheds and food peddlers outside the South Gate and Dagakou became even more prosperous. These food sheds were forcibly demolished by the traitor Liu Bengong, but now they have been rebuilt into new sheds that are more solid than before. The people who run these food sheds are freely operating under the democratic government's assistance and encouragement. As you walk through the market, you will see colorful stalls, crowded people, shouting, the sound of abacuses, and cooking sounds, which together form the symphony of the people's lives in Jining City.

[Report from this newspaper's Heze office] The Jining Jihua Iron Factory has greatly increased production due to the harmonious cooperation between the factory and the workers. The Jining City Liu Bengong Repair Shop, which was formerly a traitor's enterprise, was transformed into the Jihua Iron Factory after liberation, specializing in the manufacture of agricultural implements and industrial machinery. The factory has more than 300 workers. In March, a trade union was established. The trade union and the factory take great care of the workers, so the workers and managers have a harmonious relationship. Wages are based on market price fluctuations, so workers do not have major difficulties in their lives. In addition to work, the afternoons from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM are dedicated to learning. To improve the lives of workers, the factory has submitted 100,000 yuan to the trade union to help workers establish a cooperative. It also uses the boiler's heating system to set up a bathhouse, where workers can bathe once a week. The manager reports the business situation and administrative affairs of the factory to the workers every month, so that the workers can understand all the administrative circumstances of the factory. If they have any opinions, they can raise them as much as possible, and the factory humbly accepts them. The factory also has a profit-sharing system, so no workers are not happy and working hard, and they voluntarily organized commando teams, formulated production plans, saved raw materials, and reduced costs. The factory has now produced many cotton ginning machines and steel-wheeled cigarette rolling machines, which are sold at low prices.

　　民主政府扶导下劳资融洽
    济宁衡水工商业繁荣
    衡水天津间商船如梭，商号增加超过战前。
    济华铁厂已出弹花机、钢轮卷烟机多架。
    【本报威县讯】冀南四大名城之一，内地物资集散处，出名“白干”“毛笔”产地的衡水，工商业已日益繁荣。该城西临滏阳河，东临平大公路，有名的石德路亦道经于此，战前商业极为发达，共有商号三百零四家，三九年敌占衡水，商号遂全部停业。日本投降后，国民党又委伪军戴立波、孙子耀为五十支队，继续摧残人民，因之衡水工商业，并未因抗战胜利而改变敌在时的状况。去年十二月我军解除了伪军武装，民主政府当即扶植商号复业，发放了千万元工商业贷款，贫民贷粮三万斤，小商贩、失业工人救济贷款四十万元。得到贷款的工商业家，纷纷恢复自己的商号，仅五个半月中，全城商号即增至三百七十七家，特别是小贩，竟增加到四百摊，远远超过了战前水平。目前各街新房日益增多，手工厂飞速发展，大批出口之白干房，增加至十六家，笔业也迅速恢复，各种铁工厂，纺织厂都纷纷建立。这些货物，经过滏阳河可直达天津。由于民主政府对船支航运的保护，船民都获得了巨大的利润，因之天津船支，亦纷纷来滏阳河运货，五十多支运船，整日来往衡水天津间，数百里的滏阳河上，到处可以听到船夫们“痛快的日子到来了”的歌声。现在衡水市上奢侈品逐日减少，广大农民生产日用必须品，大量增加，如席、煤、缸瓦等物到处都可买到，这是衡水为人民服务的新手工业增多的标志。这些工业获得了最广大农民的拥戴，因之他们筹备资金也不成大问题，如新近成立的两家织布工厂，就有充足的资金三百万元，制造农具的铁工厂，一家资本即达一百零五万元。合作事业亦有着极大的发展，市民和小生产者，都把自己的积蓄，入到合作社里，如由旧粮食交易所改成的粮食合作社，从三月到五月两个月中，即获利二十八万元。在衡水码头，生活了数十年的五百余码头工人，现在亦得到解放，敌人统治时，他们完全蒙受着失业，就是在安定的战前旧社会里，他们亦遭受着大商与工头的额外剥削（一年三节给工头送礼钱等），各种苛杂亦常常抽到工人血汗所得的十分之一。现在，这批码头苦力工人，增加了工资，组织了水脚旱脚总工会，保证了工人利益，每天每个工人平均可以分到十五至二十斤小米，河西街有位工人全家五口，现不但能维持生活，每天已能余小米十斤，失业顾虑在他们现在已成过去。码头工人已经全部复业。有一位经理说：要不是国民党反动派对解放区的封锁滏阳货运，当更热闹，充满新生的衡水亦将更趋繁华。
    济宁市内摊贩激增  运河两岸叫卖声喧
    【本报济宁讯】济宁市的平民市场大闸口，在解放后三个月来已显出蓬勃气象，为全市平民唯一的市场，摊贩是露天市场的主要骨干，亦是平民生活的依靠，长不到一里的运河西岸闸口上下，与对岸同样长的一段，除旧有的店铺不计外，新设的摊子已有三百多家，南岸较北岸更繁荣，摊子占全数的五分之四，在三百多个摊子中，有一百七十多个是土布摊，堆满了各色各样的土布。还有五十多家洋布摊。土织线袜、毛布、布鞋、草帽、肥皂、烟卷、茶叶等的货摊亦甚多，其中以织线袜、肥皂最多，这个市场兴起后，南门外及大闸口一带的小贩棚和卖饭挑子的生意，更加兴隆。这些饭棚，曾被汉奸刘本功强迫拆毁，现已重建起比以前更牢靠的新棚，这些开饭棚的人们，在民主政府资助与鼓励下，自由的营业。当你走过市场，你就会看到五光十色的货摊，拥挤不堪的人群，叫卖声，算盘声，烹调声，在这里奏成了济宁市平民生活的交响乐。
    【本报荷泽讯】济宁济华铁工厂由于厂方及工人融洽合作，生产大为提高。济宁市刘逆本功修械所自解放后，就改为济华铁工厂，专造农具及工业机器。该厂共有工人三百余人，在三月间，就成立了工会，工会和厂方对工人照顾很周到，所以工人与经理感情很融洽，工资按市面物价涨落为标准，这样工人生活上就没有大困难，每日除工作外，下午五时至六时为学习时间。为了改善工人生活，厂方已提交十万元给工会，帮助工人成立合作社，并利用锅炉的暖气设立澡塘，工人每周可洗澡一次。经理每月向工人报告营业状况及厂中行政事宜，使工人了解厂里一切行政情形，如有意见可尽量提出，厂方虚心采纳。厂内并定有分红制度，所以工人没有不兴高采烈努力工作的，自动组织了突击队，订生产计划，节省原料，减低成本。现该厂已制出弹花机和钢轮卷烟机多架，贱价出卖。
