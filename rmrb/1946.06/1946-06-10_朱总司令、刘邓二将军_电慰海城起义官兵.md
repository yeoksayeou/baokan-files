Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. Commander-in-Chief Zhu, upon learning of the 184th Division's anti-civil war uprising, was deeply impressed. He sent a telegram to the division commander, Pan Shuoduan, and deputy division commander, Zheng Zuzhi, to express his condolences and encouragement. The original telegram is as follows:

To Commander Pan Shuoduan and Deputy Commander Zheng Zuzhi: And to all officers and soldiers of the 184th Division:

Having read your telegram of May 31st, I am delighted to learn of your opposition to the civil war and your determination to fight to the end for the cause of peace and democracy. Your righteousness and words are deeply admirable! The Yunnan Army has always had a glorious democratic tradition and made great contributions in the Anti-Japanese War and the acceptance of surrender. Unexpectedly, Yunnan suddenly underwent changes last winter, and the Yunnan Army was also forced to be sent to Liaoning and Jehol to use foreign weapons to harm each other, which is extremely sad! Fortunately, you have acted bravely and righteously, raised your arms, raised the banner of peace, and promoted the honor of the Yunnan Army. The hearts of the people of the whole country are stirred by this! Peace, democracy, and brightness are in sight. I hope we can work together, continue our efforts, and achieve complete success!
