    Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Directly Subordinate Organs Personnel
    Largely Involved in Production Upsurge
    Individuals Give Full Play to Strengths to Engage in Production
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th] Individual production in various directly subordinate organs of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is vigorously unfolding. According to statistics from sixteen units, a total of 1,124 people participated. Generally, organs have established special production committees to lead the effort. Among the masses, production groups are formed, some divided by agriculture and industry, some by administrative units, and others are freely combined. Production planting is diverse, to maximize the use of skills. In agriculture, plans include planting more than ten kinds of crops such as cotton, grain, millet, flax seeds, and vegetables, cultivating a total of 5,526 mu of land. In handicrafts, there are 52 kinds of activities including textile, sewing, embroidery, barbering, oil ink production, bean sprout production, vinegar and soy sauce making, etc. Achievements have been made in April, valued at 14,600,150 Border Region currency. Other activities such as social labor, construction, and repairing water ditches have yielded 1,339,800 Border Region currency. Personnel in directly subordinate organs of the Border Region have largely become involved in the production upsurge, but there are still a few people who emphasize being busy with work, only waiting for family supplies, neither wanting things nor engaging in production, thereby creating a phenomenon of evading production, which urgently needs to be overcome. It is heard that the Finance Department plans to convene responsible comrades of individual production in the organs recently to summarize in a timely manner, and further develop future organ production.
