Xinhua News Agency, Teng County, 2nd: The Lunan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently summarized the mass movement in the new Lunan District over the past month and a half. It is estimated that the district has organized more than 549,000 farmers, accounting for 20% of the new district's population; there are mass organizations in 674 villages, and 1,238 villages remain blank. In the anti-traitor rent reduction movement, eight counties including Ziyang, Guangxian, Feixian, Chuanxian, Qufu, Tengxian, Pixian, and Tanshui, the masses redeemed more than 1.7 million mu of land. The District Committee also decided to strive to organize 60% of the people in the next three months. The guidelines are: (1) In areas where the struggle against traitors and complaining about suffering and rent reduction and interest reduction are proceeding simultaneously, production education for the masses should be strengthened to help them solve various difficulties in production and organize militia to protect the wheat harvest. (2) In areas where the struggle against traitors and rent reduction are carried out in stages, the struggle against traitors should be brought to a swift conclusion based on the degree of the struggle against traitors, so as to switch to rent reduction with all efforts. (3) In areas where the struggle against traitors has not been launched on a large scale, but the time for rent reduction and interest reduction has come, rent reduction and interest reduction should be carried out after punishing important traitors. On the principle of not relaxing the struggle against traitors, the movement should not remain in the circle of anti-traitor complaints. The old areas should focus on leading the wheat harvest and protecting grain, actively organizing labor exchange and cooperation, and increasing autumn grain production as the central task. Continue to carry out mass movements in blank villages, while the border areas should accelerate the protection of the wheat harvest, implement armed self-defense, crack down on those who come to disturb and grab grain, and combine this with rent reduction to mobilize the masses.

    “鲁南总结新区群运”
    今后三月要组织群众百分之六十
    【新华社滕县二日电】中共鲁南区党委，顷总结一个半月来鲁南新区群众运动，计该区已组织了五十四万九千余农民，占新区人口百分之二十；有群众组织的村，已达六百七十四个，尚有一千二百三十八个为空白村。滋阳、广县、费县、遄县、曲阜、滕县、邳县、郯水等八县，群众在反奸减租运动中赎回土地百七十余万亩。区党委并决定今后三个月内，争取将百分之六十人民组织起来，其方针为：（１）在反奸诉苦与减租减息同时并进的地区，应加强群众生产教育，帮助群众解决生产中各种困难，组织民兵保卫麦收。（２）反奸与减租分段进行的地区，应根据反奸程度迅速告一结束，以全力转入减租。（３）反奸尚未大量发动地区，而减租减息时机已到，应经过惩办重要汉奸，转入减租减息，在不放松反奸的原则上，运动不应停留在反奸诉苦的圈子里。老区应以领导麦收保护粮食，积极组织变工合作，增加秋粮为中心任务。继续开展空白村群众运动，边沿区则应加速保卫麦收，实行武装自卫，打击出扰抢粮者，并结合减租发动群众。
