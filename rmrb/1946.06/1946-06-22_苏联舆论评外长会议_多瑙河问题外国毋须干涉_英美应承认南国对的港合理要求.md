Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. Reuters reported: Moscow Radio commented on the previous Paris conference on the 16th, which discussed the Danube River issue, pointing out: "Britain's rights on the Danube River are no greater than the rights of the Danube countries to participate in the establishment of shipping on the Thames (in Britain)." It also stated: "The Danube River issue is one of the post-war problems, artificially created by certain individuals in an attempt to restore the privileges they obtained by force rather than deserved before the war. The Danube River issue can be freely resolved by the Danube countries without any interference from foreign powers." Furthermore, according to TASS reports, Labor Party Member of Parliament Walki recently announced in a House of Commons debate: "The purpose of the United States' policy on the Danube River is to give American private enterprises the opportunity to influence the internal economy of the Danube countries."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. Reuters reported: TASS's Paris dispatch on the 16th stated: "At the Paris conference, the British and American delegations should acknowledge the Soviet Union's past concessions, and the next step for Britain and the United States should be to recognize Yugoslavia's legitimate demands regarding Trieste. At the previous Paris conference, the Soviet Union had put forward several proposals to promote agreements on issues such as Italian colonies and Italian reparations. Therefore, public opinion generally believes that the United States and Britain should also practically demonstrate an understanding of the need to find acceptable solutions to disputed issues, especially to understand Yugoslavia's legitimate demands regarding the Julian March and its natural political and economic center, Trieste, on the southern Italian border issue." The dispatch asserted: "The public opinion of broad sections of the Allied countries undoubtedly believes that the current problems of the Four Powers conference are by no means unsolvable within the conference itself." The dispatch condemned: "A large portion of the British, French, and American newspapers view the Paris conference with a dim and pessimistic tone."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th. TASS Paris dispatch: The Foreign Ministers' Conference held on the 15th has aroused enthusiastic comments in Paris. When reporting on the progress of the meeting and the resolutions passed, various newspapers believed that the resolution of the agenda issue, which caused considerable difficulties in previous Foreign Ministers' conferences, within one or two hours was a positive symbol. Some London newspapers, when talking about the Soviet delegation's stance on the Italian political situation and the economic terms in the draft peace treaty with Italy, pointed out that these steps clearly contained a caring attitude towards the Italian Democratic Republic.

　　苏联舆论评外长会议
    多瑙河问题外国毋须干涉
    英美应承认南国对的港合理要求
    【新华社延安十八日电】路透社报导：莫斯科广播于十六日评论上次巴黎会议，曾讨论的多瑙河问题，曾指出：“英国在多瑙河的权利，并不比多瑙河诸国参加建立泰晤士河（在英国）航运的权利更多些”。并称：“多瑙河问题，是战后问题之一，这些问题是由某些人士人工地制造出来，以图恢复他们战前因武力得来而非应得的特权。多瑙河问题，可以自由的由多瑙河诸国解决，而不须要外国强加以任何干涉”。又据塔斯社报导：工党国会议员瓦尔基最近在下院辩论时宣布：“美国对于多瑙河之政策之目的，在于给美国私人经营以影响多瑙河国家内部经济的机会”。
    【新华社延安十八日电】路透社报导：塔斯社十六日的巴黎讯表示：“巴黎会议上英美代表团，应确认苏联过去的让步，英美的下一步骤，应承认南斯拉夫关于的里雅斯特的合法要求。在前届巴黎会议上，苏联已提出若干建议，以促进诸如意大利殖民地问题及意国赔款等问题之协议。因此一般舆论，现在认为美国及英国方面，也应该实际上表现理解对争执问题求得可接受的解决办法之必要性，特别要谅解南斯拉夫在南意边界问题上，关于朱利亚边区及其自然的政治的及经济的中心的里雅斯特之合法的要求”。该电讯宣称：“同盟国家广泛阶层的舆论，无疑的认为四国会议当前的问题，在会议本身决不是不能解决的”。该电讯谴责：“英法美很大一部分的报纸，以一种暗淡的悲观主义的调子，来看巴黎会议”。
    【新华社延安十九日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：十五日所举行的外长会议，在巴黎引起了热烈的评论。各报在报导会议之进程上通过之决议时，均认为在前几次外长会议引起相当大困难的议事日程问题，在一二小时内获得解决，是一种积极的象征。伦敦若干报纸在谈及苏联代表团对意大利政治局势，以及对意和约草案中经济条款的采取之主张时，指出这些步骤，对意大利民主共和国显然含有爱护的意思。
