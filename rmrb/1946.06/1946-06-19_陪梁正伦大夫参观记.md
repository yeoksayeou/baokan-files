    A Record of Accompanying Doctor Liang Zheng Lun on a Visit
    Zhu Lian
    Doctor Liang Zheng Lun (original name: A. Stewart Allen) is the representative in China of the "Canadian United China Relief Fund" and the "Canadian Red Cross Society." He is a tuberculosis expert and a classmate of Doctor Bethune, who sacrificed himself in the anti-Japanese war in the Jin-Cha-Ji border region. He can speak some Chinese and is nearly fifty years old, but still very healthy.
    Doctor Liang Zheng Lun drove his own jeep and arrived in Handan on the evening of May 31st. He was accompanied by Su Jingguan, Director of the General Health Department of Yan'an. At around 9 p.m., when I saw him at the Foreign Affairs Office of the Border Government, he was talking with a Professor Chen from Northern University. After we met, he explained his purpose without wasting time, "I heard in Beijing and Shanghai that you have several general and branch hospitals of the Bethune International Peace Hospital here, some of which have already admitted patients, some are about to be built, and some are just starting construction. I also heard that with the help of your democratic government, most of the missionary hospitals have been restored or are planning to be restored. It is said that the government is also very concerned about childcare. I would like to see some of these aspects. However, my time is limited. I must rush back to Anyang to go to Beijing on the afternoon of June 5th. Please calculate the route and time carefully. Allow me to visit at least three to five hospitals in this short period. I must also tell you again: I heard that you are constantly working honestly in hardship here, but some people are spreading rumors, saying that you only talk but don't act, that you have plans, but they are empty. Now, please don't make any preparations, let me see the actual situation of your work plan." So, I agreed to meet Doctor Liang Zheng Lun again the next morning.
    Before breakfast, Doctor Liang Zheng Lun, Director Su Jingguan, Director Qian Xinzong, and I gathered around the map of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region spread out on the small round table. The map had red and blue zoning lines and marks for the locations of large and medium-sized hospitals. Doctor Liang Zheng Lun asked very carefully and in detail about the place names, routes, and the capacity of each hospital, recording them in his notebook. While we were discussing how to visit, a comrade brought in a large red invitation card for a banquet from Chairman Yang and Vice Chairman Rong of the Border Government, scheduled for noon at 12 o'clock. The visiting schedule was then decided accordingly: one day in Handan in the morning, then to Xingtai after lunch. The second day from Xingtai via Weixian in southern Hebei to Linqing. The third day from Linqing back to Handan, and if the car didn't break down, then to Wu'an. The fourth day to Linshui, and the fifth day back to Anyang.
    After breakfast, Doctor Liang Zheng Lun drove himself, first to visit the Handan branch of the International Peace Hospital, which was under construction at Congtai. According to the blueprint of the construction plan, he saw the wards, outpatient department, operating room, laboratory, kitchen, doctors' and nurses' offices, and dormitories one by one. He also asked the construction workers how much work it took to build a house, how much they were paid each day, and whether it was enough to support their families.
    When we arrived at the mobile clinic attached to the Border Region Health Bureau, it was the morning clinic time. All the rooms were diagnosing patients, and the operating room was also starting to perform surgery for patients. Doctor Liang Zheng Lun stood aside, watching intently until the surgery was over. He examined each of the very old instruments, such as hemostats, knives, forceps, scissors, and needle holders. He asked an assistant, Doctor Li, "What kind of local anesthetic do you use? What percentage? Do you add adrenaline? How much?" Doctor Li answered, "We use 2% Novocaine, 10cc, with one drop of adrenaline."
    "Do you have a sterilizer?" Doctor Liang Zheng Lun asked.
    "No!"
    "Then, how do you sterilize your materials?"
    "We use a steamer for steaming buns."
    "How many hours does it take to sterilize well?"
    "Five to six hours is enough."
    Doctor Liang Zheng Lun seemed very excited and walked into the other rooms and the pharmacy with brisk steps, looking at everything.
    The jeep drove to the gate of the Welfare Nursery outside the North Gate. We did not notify them in advance and barged in unexpectedly. The courtyard was full of small quilts and clothes drying in the sun. Director Zhou immediately stated, "Today is Saturday, our cleaning and hygiene day, it's very untidy." Doctor Liang Zheng Lun said kindly, "It doesn't matter, it's very good." He then visited the children's dormitories, washrooms, clinics, and classrooms, carefully looking and asking questions in each room: "How many children are you accommodating now? What are the standards for admission? Did the children's families bring the small quilts? What are the ways to solve the financial expenses? Why are there some small tables under the eaves? Are there any plans to expand? Have there been any infectious diseases? Have there been any deaths?" Director Zhou answered him in detail: "We have fifty-three children now. We only accept children between the ages of two and six, most of whose parents are working, some whose fathers or mothers sacrificed in the war, and some who are orphans. Some of the small quilts are brought by their families, and some are made by the nursery. Our funding mainly comes from government assistance, followed by donations and production. Because there are few houses, the children have nowhere to live, so we used the dining hall of the large class as a dormitory and temporarily used the eaves as the dining hall. We have plans to expand the accommodation to one hundred children, but it is difficult due to funding, and we cannot do it at present. Before April, there was an acute outbreak of measles and pneumonia, and all the sick children safely passed the dangerous period and have now recovered." At this time, the children gathered, dancing and singing, each one surrounding the guests, asking this and that, especially Doctor Liang Zheng Lun's back, arms, and legs were covered with children. Everyone was sticking out their little tongues and making sounds to learn foreign languages. The Canadian old man was smiling so hard that his eyes became a line. If I hadn't said, "It's almost twelve o'clock!" he would have forgotten that this was the beginning of the visit.
    We hurried to the ophthalmology clinic of the Catholic Church in Xinan Village outside the city.
    At 2:35 p.m., we arrived in Xingtai. After washing off the dust at the Municipal Government, we first went to the general hospital of the International Peace Hospital. Director He Mu (concurrently) and the doctors guided us to visit every place in the general hospital and the Peking University Medical College. The scale is very large, and the construction is about to be completed. Then we went to the Catholic Hospital. We walked briskly with our feet and kept our eyes turning east and west until it was dark before we returned to the Municipal Government.
    The next day, we visited the Jesus Church Hospital. The hostess was an American, and she cordially received the guests and took them to see all the houses. This hospital has not yet been restored because it was severely damaged by the Japanese and the big traitor Gao Delin. The hostess complained, "Last year, the Eighth Route Army fought to Xingtai, and the Japanese and puppet troops Gao Delin retreated to Beijing, robbing all the medicines and equipment in my hospital! This year, I went to Beijing to ask for them back, but Gao Delin detained me for many days. It was only after General Ye, the Communist representative of the Beijing Executive Headquarters, wrote a letter that I was sent back to Xingtai." She looked grateful with tears in her eyes.
    There were many vendors in front of the Gospel Church. When we came out, an old man asked me, "Are you here to see the Jesus Church Hospital? What country is this foreigner who drives the car from, and what does he do?" I told him that the foreigner was a doctor and the representative of the Canadian China Relief Fund. At this time, the car was about to start, and the old man hurriedly said, "Tell this doctor that when Xingtai was not liberated, this hospital jointly ran an army hospital with the Japanese devils. After liberation, our democratic government is really generous, protecting this building, saying that they are of a charitable nature for the Jesus Church, and I heard that the government will also help to open it."
    At around 10 a.m., we left Xingtai, traveling sixty miles an hour. It was estimated that we would arrive in Weixian, southern Hebei, at 1 p.m., and at the latest, we could reach Linqing by 3 p.m. Who knew that the small jeep would break down in the middle of the road? First, we added a little oil and drove more than ten miles, then added a little oil and drove more than ten miles. In the end, we used three oxen to pull it for eighteen miles, and it was almost midnight before we arrived at the Weixian Relief Sub-Association office.
    On June 3rd, the jeep was repaired. At 10 a.m., we arrived at the Linqing International Peace Hospital and met Director Lu Zhihou (concurrently). He told us that the hospital was divided into two parts: the hospital headquarters was in the city, currently accommodating more than 240 wounded and sick soldiers. The former site of the Huamei Hospital outside the city was set up as an outpatient department, which also accommodated more than 50 people, all of whom were civilians. The distance between the two is not far. When all the buildings are completed in a month, it can accommodate 500 to 800 people. So, we successively visited the outpatient department and the hospital headquarters. Doctor Liang Zheng Lun carefully paid attention to the nutritional status of each hospitalized patient and asked about the treatment process. Sometimes he personally examined the lesion part of the patient, especially when asked about those who had been injured for five or six months, or even more than ten months, and were gradually recovering, he would definitely check whether there were serious bedsores on their backs.
    "What is his illness and when was he admitted to the hospital?" Liang Zheng Lun asked Director Lu, pointing to a patient in the male ward of the outpatient department.
    "It's a stomach ulcer. He had been suffering for many years, and his body's resistance had almost completely disappeared before he was sent to the hospital. Now he can eat and doesn't hurt anymore."
    "What method of treatment are you using?"
    "We are using Chinese acupuncture therapy." After Director Lu answered, Liang Zheng Lun asked the patient to lie down and pressed on his abdomen with his hands. The patient only had a slight discomfort expression, and many acupuncture marks were neatly arranged on the abdomen at equal distances.
    We turned to the female ward, where a patient with a pale face was lying quietly. Director Lu said, "This is a postpartum patient with placenta previa. When she was giving birth, the rural midwives messed around, causing a lot of bleeding and ulceration in the lower part of her body. The fetus could not come out, and the pregnant woman was about to die. She was sent to the hospital, and a cesarean section was performed to remove the fetus and placenta. She was given a blood transfusion, injected with physiological saline, and took a large amount of sulfonamides. It has been half a month now, and the dangerous period has passed." After Doctor Liang Zheng Lun finished listening, he bent down to take her pulse and nodded.
    At the hospital headquarters, we saw a patient with a severed rib and a patient with a skin graft on his leg. Doctor Liang Zheng Lun asked to open the bandages and look at them at that time.
    After the visit, the International Peace Hospital hosted a Western-style meal. We originally planned to rush back to Handan in the afternoon, but the front wheel of the jeep broke down again in the middle of the road. We drove backwards for dozens of miles and didn't arrive in Weixian until midnight.
    On the 4th, the Southern Hebei Military Region Command sent a large truck to carry the jeep back to Handan. We arrived at the Foreign Affairs Office of the Border Government at around 6 p.m. That day was the old lunar Dragon Boat Festival. The weak moonlight illuminated the people resting in the yard. Vice Chairman Rong of the Border Government came and shook hands with Doctor Liang Zheng Lun and Director Su Jingguan intimately, saying, "It's been hard these days. I heard that the car broke down twice."
    "Yes," Doctor Liang Zheng Lun replied, "Precisely because the car broke down twice, only three-fifths of the originally planned visits were realized. We have to go back tomorrow, and it's a pity that we can't go to Wu'an and Linshui."
    "Please give more opinions on the impressions of these days' visits, Doctor Liang," said Vice Chairman Rong. At this time, Doctor Liang Zheng Lun asked Comrade Zhu Zhongzhi to translate, saying that his Chinese was not complete enough to express his thoughts. He straightened his chest and said excitedly, intermittently:
    "Our impression of this visit is very good. Doctor Su will give more opinions. I will only briefly tell you a few things that I am most interested in now."
    "Let me first talk about Handan. When visiting the mobile clinic of the Health Bureau, they were holding outpatient services. I saw an operation that surprised me: First, they did not have a complete operating room. They could hang up a clean white tent in a large room to block dust. Second, the equipment they used was very simple, but the surgery was done very well. Third, in such difficult conditions, although they didn't even have a pair of rubber gloves, the disinfection was very strict. Everyone participating in the surgery wore surgical gowns, hats, and masks. The doctors were all very responsible."
    "At the International Peace Hospital in Xingtai, they are under construction and have not yet admitted patients, so allow me not to mention anything. In short, the scale of their construction is grand, and the doctors are very responsible for supervising the work."
    "The best work may be in Linqing. The original Huamei Hospital was where the International Friends Ambulance Team carried out medical treatment. Later, they were driven away by the Japanese army. The government took it over from the Japanese and renovated and built it again. Now it accommodates many civilian patients."
    "A pregnant woman with placenta previa who was about to die has now been saved after a cesarean section. A stubborn leg injury has undergone a skin graft and will also be cured. These are very interesting to me."
    "However, I hope the government will pay attention. Midwives in rural areas who have not received scientific training are not capable of undertaking this obstetrical work. It is related to the danger of two lives."
    "Yes, your opinion is very good. We have already started midwife training classes in some areas, and we will carry them out universally in the future. At present, our liberated areas must first implement rent reduction and interest reduction and develop a large-scale production movement so that farmers have land to cultivate and food to eat, and then we can focus on the social health movement." Vice Chairman Rong accepted and replied to Doctor Liang Zheng Lun's opinions with an open mind and sincerity.
    Doctor Liang Zheng Lun continued, "The wounded and sick soldiers of the Eighth Route Army that I saw there were all so happy. Although they had wounds on their bodies, most of them were in very good health."
    "What surprised me especially was that so many patients who had been injured for a long time did not have bedsores on their backs. I only found one person who had one, and the area of the sore was only this big - Doctor Liang Zheng Lun formed a circle with his thumb and forefinger - which proves the responsibility of the doctors and nurses. The patients should understand this and be especially grateful to the nurses."
    "Most of the doctors and nurses here are trained by themselves under difficult conditions. In our eyes, they are not suitable for our requirements in terms of theory and technology, but they have a lot of practical experience, and their attitude towards work is practical and responsible."
    "..."
    "There are many rumors outside that the liberated areas have a bad attitude towards foreigners and that the work is not done well. This time, I met with many responsible persons and saw the work situation. Everywhere proves that the facts are completely different from the rumors. You are all indeed fulfilling your obligations to the people."
    "Your material conditions are very difficult, but you have ways to overcome them. If you insist on your own methods of creation on the one hand and add external assistance on the other hand, your work will be done better in the future. This is my hope and the direction I will work hard for you when I go back this time."
    "..."
    It was time for dinner. Vice Chairman Rong and Doctor Liang Zheng Lun were still chatting while eating with relish. I was a little tired from the past few days of travel, so I finished eating and said goodbye first.
            June 7th, in Handan

    陪梁正伦大夫参观记
    朱琏
    梁正伦大夫（原名：A.StewartAllen）是“加拿大全加助华总会”“加拿大红十字会”的驻华代表，他是肺痨科专家，和牺牲在晋察冀边区抗日战争中的白求恩大夫是同学，能讲一般的中国话，年纪将近五十岁了，但体格还很健壮。
    梁正伦大夫自己开着吉普车，于五月三十一日傍晚来到邯郸。同行者有延安总卫生部苏井观部长。晚上九时许，我在边府交际处看他的时候，他正和北方大学一位陈教授交谈。我们见面后，他毫不浪费时间的说明他的来意，“我在北平上海曾经听说你们这里有白求恩国际和平医院总院分院多处，有的早已收容病人，有的快要建筑好，或正在开始建筑；又曾听说在你们民主政府的帮助下，大部分教会医院已经恢复，或正计划恢复，据说政府对保育事业也很关心，这些方面我都想部分的看一看。不过，我的时间有限，六月五号下午一定要赶回安阳去北平的，请你们将路线和时刻都计算好。允许我在这短促的日子时，至少参观三个到五个地区的医院。我还得告诉你一遍：听说你们这里是经常在艰苦中老老实实地工作着，可是，也有人造谣，说你们只讲不做，有计划，而是空洞的，现在请不要做任何准备，让我看一看你们工作计划的实际情况吧。”于是我和梁正伦大夫约定第二天清晨再见。
    早餐前，梁正伦大夫、苏井观部长、钱信忠部长和我四个人，围绕着展开在小圆桌上的晋冀鲁豫边区地图的旁面。地图上有红蓝色的划区线，有大医院中等医院所在地的标记。梁正伦大夫很周密详细的问清楚地名、路程以及各该医院的收容量，随时记录在他的本子上。正在商讨怎样参观的时候，小同志送进来边府杨主席戎副主席邀请欢宴的大红请帖，时间是正午十二点，参观日程也就随之决定了：一日上午在邯郸，午饭后去邢台。二日由邢台经冀南威县到临清。三日由临清返邯郸，只要汽车不出毛病，随即去武安。四日去临水，五日返安阳。
    早饭后，梁正伦大夫亲自司机，先到丛台参观正在修建的国际和平医院邯郸分院，他按照建设计划的图样，将病房、门诊部、手术室、化验室、厨房、医生护士办公室以及寝室等等，一一看到，又问土木工人盖一间房子需多少工，每天多少工资，够不够养家。
    当我们到边区卫生局附设流动诊疗所时，正是上午门诊时间，各种室都在诊病，手术室也正在开始为病人施行手术。梁正伦大夫站在旁面，聚精会神的直看到手术结束，他把血管钳、刀子、镊子、剪子、持针器、缝合针等很旧的器械，每件都看过，他问一位助手李医生：“局部用的什么麻药？百分之几的？加不加adrenaline？加多少？”，李医生接口回答：“用百分之二的Novocaine十西西中加adrenaline一滴”
    “你们有没有消毒器？”梁正伦大夫问，
    “没有！”
    “那么，你们的材料用什么消毒呢？”
    “用蒸馒头的蒸笼消毒”。
    “几小时可以消毒好？”
    “五小时至六小时就可以了。”
    梁正伦大夫很兴奋似的，以轻快的步伐转进其他各种室和司药处，统统看完。
    吉普车开到北门外福利托儿所的门前，我们事先未通知他们，冒然的闯进去了，满院子晒着小被子小衣服，周所长马上声明：“今天星期六，是我们清洁卫生的一天，很不整齐”，梁正伦大夫慈祥地说：“不要紧，好得很”，随即参观儿童的寝室、洗漱室、诊疗室、教室，每到一室都仔细的看仔细的问：“现在收容多少儿童？怎样才合乎收容的标准？小被子是儿童家里带来的吗？有什么办法解决经费开支呢？廊檐下为什么放着一些小条桌？有扩大的计划吗？发生过传染病没有，有不有死亡？……”周所长也详细的答复了他：“现在有五十三个儿童了。我们只收容两岁以上六岁以下的，大部分是父母都在工作着的，有的是在抗战中牺牲了父亲或母亲的，有的是孤儿。小被子也有家里带来的，也有本所给做的。我们的经费，主要是政府帮助，其次是募捐和生产。因为房子少，儿童无处住，将大班儿童的膳堂做了寝室，暂把廊檐下做膳堂。我们有扩大收容到一百名的计划，就是经费困难，目前还办不到。四月前发生过麻疹和肺炎的急性传染病，所有的患病的儿童，都安全的渡过了危险期，现在都已恢复健康了”。这时候，儿童集合起来了，跳着舞，唱着歌，一个个都围绕在客人周围，问这问那的，特别是梁正伦大夫的背上，臂膀上，腿上都爬满了儿童，大家把小舌头一吐一吞呜噜呜噜的学外国话。这位加拿大的老头子，笑得抿不拢嘴，眼睛成一条线了，要不是我说：“时间快十二点了！”他会忘掉这是参观的开头哩。
    急急忙忙又到城外西南庄参观了天主堂的眼科诊疗所。
    下午二时三十五分，我们到了邢台，在市政府稍洗尘土，便先到国际和平医院总院，何穆（兼）院长与各位大夫，引导着参观总院和北大医学院的每一个地方，规模很宏大，建筑将要竣工了。而后又去天主堂医院。一鼓劲的两脚行走两眼不停的东转西看，直到天黑才回到市政府。
    次日参观耶稣教医院，女主人是美国人，她殷勤的招待着客人，去看所有的房舍。这个医院还未恢复，因为被日本人和大汉奸高德林毁坏过重，女主人诉苦的说：“去年八路军打到邢台了，日军和伪军高德林溃退北平，将我医院里全部药品器械都抢走了！今年我到北平去要，反被高德林扣押多天，几来经北平执行部中共代表叶将军写了信送我回邢台来的”，她很感激似的眼圈红了。
    福音堂的门前，有许多小贩，我们出得门来，一位老汉问我：“你们出来看耶稣教医院的吗？这个开汽车的外国人是那一国的，干啥的？”我告诉他外国人是个大夫，是加拿大的援华总会代表，这时汽车要开动了，老汉急忙的说：“你告诉这个大夫，在邢台没有解放时，这个医院和日本鬼子联合办陆军医院，解放以后，咱们民主政府真是宽大呵，保护了这座房子，说他们是耶稣教慈善性质的，听说政府还要帮助开办哩”。
    上午十时许，我们离开邢台，一小时走六十里，估计下午一时抵冀南威县，至迟到三点就可以到临清了。那知矫小的吉普车在中途出了毛病，先是加一点油开十多里，加一点油开十多里，最后还是用三头黄牛拉了十八里，近午夜才到威县救济分会办事处。
    六月三日吉普车修理好了，上午十时抵达临清国际和平医院，会见鲁之后（兼）院长，他告诉我们，医院分为两部分：院部在城内，目前收容伤病员二百四十多名。城外华美医院旧址设门诊部，其中也已收容五十多名，全是老百姓。两下距离不远，一个月后全部建筑好时，可收容五百至八百名。于是先后参观了门诊部和院部，梁正伦大夫很仔细的注意每个住院病人的营养状态，并问治疗经过，有时亲手去诊察病人的病灶部分，尤其是问到五六个月甚或十个月以上的，渐近恢复的受伤者，必检视背部有无严重的褥疮。
    “他是什么病，什么时候入院的？”梁正伦在门诊部男病房里指着一个病人问鲁院长。
    “是胃溃疡，已经拖了多年，身体的抵抗力几乎全失掉了才送入医院，现在已经进饮食，而也不痛了。”
    “用什么方法治疗的？”
    “我们在用中国的针灸疗法”。鲁院长回答后，梁正伦叫病人躺下，用手在腹部触压，病人只有轻微不适的表情，腹部确排列着许多相等距离的针迹。
    转到女病房了，一个苍白脸色的病人安静的躺着鲁院长说：“这是个前置胎盘”的产后期病人，临产时，农村接产妇胡乱的搞，出血极多，下部都溃烂了，胎儿下不来，产妇将断气，送到医院，施行剖腹手术取出胎儿胎盘，给他输血注射生理食盐水，服大量磺胺类，现在已半个月，危险期已过去了”。梁正伦大夫听完后，弯下身子去把脉，点了点头。
    在院部看到一个肋骨切断的病人，和一个腿部补皮的病人，梁大夫当时都要求打开绷带看过。
    参观完毕，由国际和平医院招待西餐，本打算在下午赶着回邯郸，结果又因吉普车的前轮在中途出毛病，开了几十里路倒车，半夜十二时才能到威县。
    四日承冀南军区司令部派大汽车载着吉普车送我们回邯郸，下午六时许到达边府交际处。是日是旧历端阳节，微弱的月光照着院子里休息的人们，边府戎副主席来了，与梁正伦大夫、苏井观部长亲切的握着手说：“这几天很辛苦了，听说汽车坏过两次”。
    “是的”梁正伦大夫接口说“正是因为汽车出了两次毛病，原定参观的计划只实现了五分之三，明天我们就得回去，可惜武安和临水不能去了”。
    “请梁大夫将这几日参观的印象，多多提些意见”，戎副主席说。这时梁正伦大夫请朱仲芷同志翻译，他说他的中国话不够完全表达他的心意。他挺起胸脯，兴奋的一断一断的说着：
    “我们这次参观的印象很好，苏大夫他会提更多的意见的，我现在只简单的告诉您几件我最有兴趣的事情。”
    “我首先说在邯郸吧，卫生局流动诊疗所，去参观时他们正是门诊，我看了一个开刀使我惊奇的：第一、他们还没有完备的手术室，能在一间大房子里，周围挂起洁白的蓬帐，阻挡了尘灰。第二、他们用的器械极简单，可是手术做得很好。第三、他们在那样困难的条件下，虽然连一双橡皮手套都没有，但消毒是很严密的，每个参加手术的人，都穿着手术衣戴着帽子与口罩。医生们都是很负责的态度。”
    “到邢台国际和平医院，他们正在建筑，还没有收容病人，允许我不提什么，总之，他们建筑的规模是宏大的，医生们很负责任的在监工”。
    “最好的工作，可能是在临清。原先的华美医院，曾经是国际公谊救护队在那边进行医疗，后来被日本军队赶走了，政府从日本人手里拿过来，重新修理建设，现在收容着很多老百姓病人。”
    “一个前置胎盘将要死亡的产妇，经过剖腹手术，现在已没有危险性了。一个顽固性的腿部创伤，施行了补皮手术，也将达到治愈的目的了。这些使我很感兴趣。”
    “不过，我希望政府注意，象农村中没有受过科学训练的接产妇人，她是没有能力担任这个产科工作的，那是有关两条生命危险的事情”。
    “是的，您的意见很好，我们有些地区已经开办接产训练班，将来还要普遍的进行。目前我们解放区得先实行减租减息，发展大生产运动，使农民有地种有饭吃，而后才能着重社会卫生运动的”。戎副主席虚心诚恳的接受与答复了梁正伦大夫的意见。
    梁正伦大夫继续说：“在那边我所看到的八路军的伤病员，都是那么快乐的，身上虽然有伤口，但是绝大多数的健康状态都很好。”
    “尤其使我惊奇的，那么多受伤很久的病人，背上没有生褥疮，我只发现到一个人有，疮口的范围还仅仅这样大，——梁正伦大夫用姆指和食指形成一个圆圈——这就证明着医生护士的责任心，这一点要使病人了解特别应该感激护士”。
    “你们这里的医生护士，大部分是在困难条件下自己培养的，按我们的眼光来看，在理论与技术方面是不适合我们的要求，但是他们有好多实际经验，对工作的态度是切实的负责的。”
    “……”
    “在外面有许多谣言，说解放区对外来人的态度很不好，工作也做的不好，这一次，我与许多负责人见了面，也见到了工作情形，处处都证明着事实与谣言完全不同，你们大家确确实实的在为人民尽义务哩。”
    “你们的物质条件很困难，但你们有办法克服，如果一方面坚持你们自己创造的办法，一方面再加上外面的援助，将来你们的工作会做得更好。这是我的希望，也是我此次回去后为你们努力的方向。”
    “……”
    吃晚饭了，戎副主席和梁正伦大夫还津津有味的在边吃边谈，我因几日来的旅行有些疲劳，便先吃完告辞了。
            六月七日于邯郸
