    [This newspaper's Yangcheng 15th dispatch] The former Wang Haiqing and Lei Wenqing units of the Fennan Local Special Task Force refused Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's orders for civil war and staged an uprising on the front lines, establishing the Fennan People's Self-Defense Army. Our reporter made a special trip to the war zone to interview the army, and was received by Deputy Commander Lei Wenqing. Lei first recounted the experiences of the Special Task Force during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, saying: "Since the War of Resistance, the Local Special Task Force has fought in Fennan, enduring hardships, fighting the Japanese and puppet troops more than 400 times, killing more than 500 enemies, and recovering several larger strongholds such as Hejin and Majiazhuang, establishing county governments such as West Hejin and Ronghe in Gushan. If merit were to be rewarded, the Kuomintang should have praised and assisted us. However, the opposite was true. In the winter of 1942, we were annexed by Hu Zongnan and reorganized into the Fennan Advance Column, detaining a large number of our cadres, some of whom were executed, others exiled, and the soldiers were also broken up. I was forced to join my friend Wang Haiqing's unit in Ronghe (under Yan Xishan's Tiaoli Advance Column), and at great sacrifice, opened up the Anxi area and established a government, only to be suspected by Zhao Chengshou again. First, Wang Haiqing was ordered to devise a way to murder me, but Wang refused out of righteousness, and instead cooperated with Gao Zhuo's unit and the Japanese and puppet troops to encircle and annihilate us. I insisted on fighting for eight months, and Gao had no choice but to invite local gentry to negotiate with us. For the sake of national interests, we were reorganized into the 34th Army Special Task Force in May 1943. In December of last year, Gao Zhuozhi ordered the Special Task Force to set off from Yuncheng and head north to the Linfen area to 'suppress the Communists.' We recognized that the Eighth Route Army was a strong people's army serving the country and the people, and were unwilling to repeat the mistakes of the civil war after the war. Therefore, we refused to obey the order and, when we reached Guxi, filed a complaint, proving that the troops were too local and unable to complete the long-distance mission. As a result, we were reorganized into the Local Special Task Force. Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan forced us to 'suppress the Communists,' which was a double-edged sword policy to eliminate dissidents." Deputy Commander Lei became even more indignant at this point. He continued: "This time, Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan created an anti-communist civil war in Fennan, forcing us to accept chaotic orders, which was opposed by all our officers and soldiers. We advocate peace and democracy and the construction of a new China. Therefore, we were even more intolerable to Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan, who launched a large-scale attack on us. Commander Wang Haiqing and I then led all the officers and soldiers to stage a resolute uprising on the front lines, and immediately established the Fennan People's Self-Defense Army, vowing to fight to the end with the Kuomintang reactionaries to protect the lives and property of the people of Fennan and the cause of peace and democracy for the people of the whole country." Deputy Commander Lei finally warned the Kuomintang reactionaries: "We do not want to eliminate others, and we do not want others to eliminate us. If Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan attempt to eliminate our army, we will have no choice but to resolutely and decisively eliminate them in self-defense. We demand that the Kuomintang authorities immediately stop the civil war, end the one-party dictatorship, implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and realize national democratic peace. Then the Chinese people will be fortunate, and the people of Fennan will be fortunate!"

    雷文清氏发表谈话
    痛斥蒋阎排除异己，挑动内战；
    力主结束一党专政，实现民主和平。
    【本报阳城十五日电】原汾南地方特务团王海清、雷文清部，拒绝蒋阎内战命令，火线起义，成立汾南人民自救军，记者特赴战地访问该军，当蒙雷文清副司令接见，雷氏首先叙述抗战八年中特务团的经历说：“抗战以来，地方特务团曾转战汾南，历尽苦辛，先后与日伪作战四百余次、毙敌五百余人，克复较大据点如河津、马家庄等数处，建立了孤山的西河津、荣河等县政权，若论功行赏，国民党应予以褒扬接济，惟事实适与此相反。三十一年冬，竟被胡宗南吞并，改编为汾南挺进总队，扣留我大批干部，处死者有之，流放者有之，战士亦被拆散，本人迫不得已随同好友数十人，投荣河王海清部（为阎锡山条理挺进纵队），不惜重大牺牲，开辟安西地区，建立政权，竟又遭赵承绶猜忌，初令王海清设法谋害，王仗义不忍，乃以高倬之部配合日伪军进行围歼，我坚持作战八月之久，高乃不得不邀地方士绅与我等进行协商，我以相忍为国，于三十二年五月改编为三十四军特务团。去年十二月高倬之命令特务团由运城出发北上临汾一带“剿共”，我们认清八路军为国为民，是一支坚强的人民军队，并且不甘再蹈党战后的覆辙，故未受命于军行至孤西，乃提出申诉，证明部队地方性大，碍难完成远征任务，于是被改编为地方特务团。蒋介石阎锡山迫使我们进行“剿共”，乃排除异己之一箭双雕政策。”雷副司令谈至此处，更加愤慨，他继续说：“此次蒋阎在汾南制造反共内战，强迫我等接受乱命，为我全体官兵所反对，我们力主和平民主、建设新中国，因此更遭蒋阎之不容，遂倾大军向我进攻，本人与王海清司令乃率领全体官兵，在火线上毅然起义后，随即成立汾南人民自救军，誓为保卫汾南人民生命财产及全国人民和平民主事业，与国民党反动派奋斗到底。”雷副司令最后并警告国民党反动派说：“我们不愿消灭别人，更不愿别人消灭我们，如蒋介石、阎锡山妄图消灭本军，我们只好站在自卫立场上坚决干脆的予以消灭。我们要求国民党当局立即停止内战，结束一党专政，执行政协决议，实现全国的民主和平，则中国人民幸甚，汾南人民幸甚！”
