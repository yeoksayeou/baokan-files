Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Moscow dispatch: The Pravda published on the 28th the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's concluding statement on the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, the main points of which are as follows:

(1) On the basis for convening the Paris Conference and the assessment of its achievements: Molotov said that it was held in accordance with the decisions of the Berlin Conference last August and the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference in December. According to the decision of the Moscow Conference, draft treaties on the issues of treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland should be drafted with the unanimous agreement of the two powers (and the four powers on the Italian treaty). After the drafting is completed, a peace conference will be convened to discuss the treaties with the above-mentioned countries. At the Paris Conference, the guiding principle of the Soviet delegation was to believe that it was necessary to accurately implement the above-mentioned decisions. Molotov said: At the Paris Conference, the Soviet delegation could not agree with the proposal of the US delegation supported by the UK, that regardless of whether a prior agreement was reached in the preparation of the draft treaties, the deadline for convening the peace conference should be stipulated in advance, because this would result in the following situation: At the peace conference, instead of submitting a single draft treaty for Italy, several drafts would be submitted. In this way, a certain group participating in the peace conference would sign one kind of treaty, while another group would sign another kind of treaty, and in fact, the single peace conference would completely fail. This proposal by the United States not only contradicts the Berlin Conference and the previous decisions of the Moscow Conference, but also generally has the worst negative consequences for the cause of continuing to develop and consolidate peace and friendly relations among all nations. Therefore, the Soviet delegation at the meeting strived to find a basis for unanimous agreement on the basic issues of the treaty. It should be acknowledged that certain positive results have been achieved in this regard, although these results are far from sufficient.

(2) On the achievements and unresolved issues of the treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, Molotov said: The above-mentioned treaties have been largely completed, except for economic issues which have not been discussed. On all fundamental issues—territory, military restrictions, reparations, and other issues—certain agreements have been reached between the governments responsible for preparing these treaties. The attainment of this achievement is mainly due to the Soviet government's proposal to incorporate the armistice clauses (missing nine characters in the original), which already include the basic obligations of the vassal states. These armistice clauses fully guarantee the legitimate interests of the Allied countries, but do not lead to foreign interference in the internal affairs of these countries. Molotov said: "The unresolved issues in the above-mentioned treaties are mainly the economic aspects of the treaty—that is, issues such as trade and navigation on the Danube River, which are closely related to the interests of the Danube countries. This issue has been discussed more than once at the Foreign Ministers Conference. The Soviet Union believes that if anyone wishes for friendly relations among the Danube River countries, then these issues cannot be discussed and decided without the participation of these countries. The issue of Danube River navigation is primarily a matter for the Danube River countries themselves, and cannot be decided solely in treaties with individual Danube River countries. It cannot be considered a correct action if certain non-Danube countries arbitrarily order the Danube River countries to act according to their will, disregarding the interests of the Danube River countries, especially the interests of the Allied Danube countries (such as Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia)."

(3) Difficulties and differences regarding the Italian treaty: Molotov said: "The situation is even more complex with this issue. The basic disagreements are on issues such as reparations, the disposition of colonies, the southern border, economic issues, and the form of control." (1) Regarding the issue of reparations, Molotov pointed out: "Based on the invasion of the Soviet Union by hundreds of thousands of Italian fascist troops between 1941 and 1942, and the enormous losses and damages inflicted on the Soviet Union, based on the situations in Yugoslavia, Greece, and Albania, and the Soviet Union's emphasis on the significance of democratic Italy's participation in the Allied forces at the end of the war, we demand that Italy pay a relatively small sum of US$100 million to the Soviet Union within six years (this is to remind everyone that actions of aggression and invasion of other countries should be punished). At the same time, the Soviet Union believes that it is also correct to give US$200 million in reparations to countries such as Yugoslavia, Greece, and Albania. However, this extremely moderate demand was only supported by the French delegation at the Paris Conference. The United States and the United Kingdom, along with it, did not support these legitimate demands of the Soviet Union, although at the Berlin Conference, when the issue of reparations was frequently raised, the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom all believed that it was justified to treat enemy navies as war booty and not include them in reparations. But now, part of the Italian war booty is designated for paying the Soviet Union's reparations. For people who have suffered from foreign invasion, the whole matter cannot be resolved with just a few words of sympathy, while also issuing an appeal to "forget about reparations." This only proves the correctness of the Russian proverb "The full man does not know the hunger of the starving man." At the same time, according to declarations in the Italian newspapers, everyone already knows that Italy bears huge occupation costs for the UK and the US. A slight savings on this item, which amounts to tens of billions of US dollars, would be enough for Italy to pay the Soviet Union's reparations demands. On the other hand, we also know very well that Italian industry needs foreign orders. Fulfilling the Soviet Union's reparations demands could provide Italian industry with several years of wage orders without becoming a significant burden on the Italian national budget. However, for some reason, the US and the UK are precisely opposed to Italy using goods delivered to the Soviet Union as a way to pay reparations, saying that if Italian industry delivers goods to the Soviet Union in this way, it will rely on US and UK financial aid as Italy's capital. This statement is unfounded. At the same time, it cannot be considered correct to say that Italian industry should be treated as an appendage to the interests of the British and American industrial groups. Italian national industry has a rich history and now needs to open up a new and important prospect for development. If we are not interfered with, the Soviet Union and Italy will be able to quickly reach an agreement on the issue of reparations without particular difficulty. (2) Regarding the issue of the disposition of colonies, Molotov said: "We do not insist that Tripolitania be placed under the sole trusteeship of the Soviet Union for several years, or even under joint trusteeship with Italy, although this is of great importance to Soviet ships on the Mediterranean shipping lanes and will fully guarantee the interests of establishing national independence in Tripolitania in the short term. France and the Soviet Union are both willing to place Italian colonies under Italy's own trusteeship, with Italy completing the task of preparing these countries for national independence under the autonomous guidance of the United Nations. The US delegation initially supported this proposal, but they quickly abandoned this position in opposition to the UK delegation, and the concessions made by the Soviet Union on this issue did not receive the due attention or fair recognition. What is particularly evident in this issue is that the British and American delegations usually act according to pre-arranged agreements, which is contrary to the interests of all other countries. According to the British draft, almost all of Italy's colonies would actually fall under British control. The UK proposes that Tripolitania and Cyrenaica form an "independent Libya," but British troops would not withdraw. It also proposes the formation of "Greater Somalia," which includes both Italian Somaliland and Abyssinian territories, placed under British trusteeship. In this way, Britain obtains new expansion of its power in North Africa and Northeast Africa, thus sacrificing not only Italy but also Abyssinia. If this plan were to be realized, it would be sufficient to further consolidate Great Britain's de facto monopoly position throughout the Mediterranean and Red Seas." Molotov pointed out: "The United States supports this British plan, and any proposals that are unfavorable to the continued consolidation of Britain's monopoly position in the Mediterranean are firmly opposed by the United States. This is how this issue has not been resolved." (3) Regarding the Italian border issue, Molotov pointed out: "The issue of the fate of Trieste should also be considered a fundamental issue at the Paris Conference." He said: "The Soviet delegation supports the righteousness of Yugoslavia's demands on the Julian March region, but the UK and the US propose dividing the Julian March into eastern and western parts, which damages the important national interests of Yugoslavia and causes serious economic damage to the port of Trieste. This issue has not been resolved. But it is clear that this issue requires an immediate agreement in the spirit of satisfying the national interests of our ally, Yugoslavia." (4) Regarding economic issues, Molotov said: "The importance of this issue cannot be underestimated, especially when similar economic issues also exist in other treaties. In the process of preparing the treaties, there seems to be a tendency to endanger the countries that have been weakened in the war, that is, the attempts by British and American capital to subordinate the economies of large and small countries to their power, and to turn their so-called economic assistance to these countries into a tool to achieve this goal. They defend this interest, and they often put forward the benefits of lifting restrictions on trade and other things, and allowing foreign capital to act freely. At the same time, the Soviet delegation cannot but consider the interests of the former vassal states that have now embarked on the road of democratic development and economic revival, because the Soviet Union cannot support attempts to force any country to be economically subordinate to other countries, and can never regard countries like Italy as colonies, where great powers exercise their hegemony, completely disregarding the national interests of these countries." (5) Regarding the issue of control, Molotov said: "According to the US draft, the 'Treaty Committee' is organized by representatives of the US, UK, Soviet Union, and France in Italy. This committee should exercise the powers stipulated in the treaty regarding military affairs, reparations, restoration, and the investigation of war criminals within a dozen months after the signing of the treaty." Molotov pointed out: "It is fundamentally incompatible with Italy's national sovereignty for this committee to hold such extensive powers in the territory of a foreign democratic country. It is very much like imposing 'subjugation rule' on Italy and contradicts the proposal to alleviate the terms of the armistice. After the treaty is signed, the road to participation in the United Nations organization should be opened up for Italy. Therefore, this issue has not been agreed upon, but it can also be believed that further deliberation will make those who put forward this plan feel that it is inappropriate to insist on establishing a 'Treaty Committee'."

(4) On the German Question—Molotov said: "This question was discussed according to the French proposal, but the conference did not begin to discuss France's demand to merge the Ruhr, Rhineland and Saar provinces; on the other hand, the US delegation proposed to discuss the so-called Four-Power Treaty Draft on the Disarmament of the German Army, which was drafted in the spirit of the famous suggestion of the notorious US Senator Vandenberg. On this point, Beneš pointed out that as early as last December when he was in Moscow, he had asked Stalin for his attitude towards the conclusion of such a treaty, and said that he had obtained Stalin's agreement in principle. However, people should keep in mind that Beneš has made many inaccurate statements here, because Beneš did not have such a draft at that time, so Stalin could not express any 'agreement' to this non-existent treaty. In fact, at that time, there was simply an exchange of views on mutual assistance treaties in case German or Japanese aggression revived, and the draft proposed by Beneš later did not mention the implementation of mutual assistance against German and Japanese aggression at all, but only mentioned the issue of disarmament, and for some reason, did not mention the most important decisions on the German issue passed by the Allied countries at the Tehran, Yalta, and Berlin conferences, which may lead to a weakening of the Allied control mechanism aimed at preventing the resurgence of German aggression, of course, such a weakening is absolutely not allowed. Therefore, at the meeting, the Soviet Union suggested that this draft treaty be studied by the governments of the countries concerned before a decision should be made in haste. Moreover, Beneš said that this treaty could only take effect after the German treaty was signed, so there should be no hurry to decide, because Germany now does not even have the embryo of a government that continuously signs treaties with the Allied countries. At the end of the night before the Paris Conference closed, Beneš put forward another even more abrupt proposal, demanding that an Allied conference be convened on November this year to discuss the issue of the treaty with Germany. Regarding this point, people can recall that Stalin, the head of the Soviet government, as early as the Berlin Conference in July last year, had put forward a proposal regarding the independent establishment of a certain German central administrative agency. At that time, the UK and the US opposed discussing this issue, and no one has mentioned this issue since then. Therefore, Beneš's proposal was not adopted by the conference."

(5) On the Significance of the Paris Conference Summary—Molotov pointed out: "The summary of the conference shows that there are certain differences between the Four Powers in discussing the five draft treaties. Now it is revealed that there are only certain differences of opinion on the drafts of treaties with Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, for which the Soviet Union bears the main responsibility, which should not be exaggerated. As for the treaties with Italy, for which the UK and the US bear the main responsibility, many major issues have not been agreed upon. Here, the Soviet Union has taken a number of steps to reach a universal agreement. Doing so will also ultimately promote agreement on this draft treaty." "The conference showed that there are also completely unfavorable tendencies in the preparation of the treaty. The so-called 'peace offensive' announced by some people in the United States (as Beneš announced in a broadcast on the evening of the 20th) is only manifested in the coercion of a certain two governments to force the governments of third countries to submit to their opinions, such as the issue of the fate of Italian colonies. The Soviet Union gave up its demands on this issue, but the two delegations of the UK and the US formed a group, so there was no hope of reaching a unanimous agreement. The same is true on the issue of reparations. Here, they are not conducting any 'peace offensive' but a offensive against the Soviet Union. Since the British and American delegations formed a group, attempting to force the Soviet Union to submit to their will, they were completely unwilling to estimate the most reasonable wishes of the Soviet Union, and disrupted the possibility of reaching a common agreement on the issue of reparations." "The Paris Conference also showed that the attempts of certain countries to force other countries to submit to their will have been met with natural resistance. Of course, no self-respecting ally will allow other countries to impose their will on their heads, and the Soviet Union is naturally no exception. On the other hand, the Soviet Union fully demonstrated that it is eagerly willing to act in concert with other countries. During the war, it was for the victory of the Allied countries, and after the war, it was to ensure lasting peace and the security of all countries in the world. Sometimes people say that it is difficult to draw the boundary between the desire for security and the desire for expansionism (as Beneš asserted in the aforementioned broadcast). Indeed, sometimes it is difficult. For example, what security desire does the United States have to demand the establishment of military bases in Iceland? It is obvious that this is not a matter of US security, but a completely different motive. Newspapers around the world have published such news, saying that some people in the United States and their British friends have formed a group, attempting to establish naval, land, and air bases everywhere on the planet, on the islands of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and in the territories of countries in the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. No wonder that in some countries, people who advocate the new imperialist world hegemony by one of the strongest countries are worth a hundredfold, and regardless of their official status as senators or representatives, they spare no effort to promote their expansion plans, inciting new wars of aggression. They are blind to the lessons of the inglorious collapse of the imperialist German plan to dominate the world. The future does not belong to these gentlemen, but to countries like the Soviet Union that desire lasting peace and integrate the interests of their own national security with the interests of the security of other peace-loving countries. The efforts of some strong countries to force other countries to submit to their will will still exist in the future, but if they want to do the same to the Soviet Union, then they will inevitably be doomed to disastrous failure, whether in the past or in the future. Only the desire for friendly cooperation, where there is no room for forcing one country to obey another country or two countries, can become a reliable basis for the development of relations between the Soviet state and other countries. It is possible without suspicion that these principles of international cooperation will also be increasingly recognized in other democratic countries. Everyone knows that during the war, a definite procedure was developed among the Allied countries for passing unanimous resolutions. Not only at the Moscow Conference in 1943, but also at the Tehran, Yalta, and Berlin conferences, unanimous decisions that everyone agreed upon were adopted on very important issues. These decisions were not adopted in a situation where one country was forced to submit to the will of another country, but in a situation of friendship, harmony, and mutual understanding. This method of cooperation has achieved positive results. Now some people are trying to undermine this procedure. They are constantly trying to undermine this proven effective method of work. At the Paris Conference, it was proposed that the peace conference should be convened without waiting for the four powers to reach a unanimous agreement on the draft treaty, and go there to start disputes and struggles. The Soviet delegation rejected this attempt to undermine the established principles of the Allies' joint work. After the Paris Conference, Beneš put forward a new and more ambitious plan (referring to the aforementioned broadcast by Beneš), proposing that those drafts that have not reached an agreement be submitted to the United Nations organization for discussion, although everyone knows that the United Nations organization has nothing to do with the treaty issue. This is another attempt to undermine the procedure of joint work established in recent years, an attempt to use methods of pressure, threat, and intimidation, but it is obvious and has been repeatedly proven to be useless to use this method against the Soviet Union. However, these attempts show that some foreigners have a strong desire to undermine the principles of the Allies' joint work, and attempt to deal with the Soviet Union and other democratic countries by means that are incompatible with normal relations between countries, and want to use the United Nations organization as a tool for this attempt. It is well known that if one is willing to risk undermining the prestige of the United Nations organization by using the strategy of a united vote of national organizations, then such things can be done. We already have examples of this situation. It is undeniable that the prestige of the Security Council has already been severely tested."

(6) Concluding Remarks—Molotov finally said: "All of this can explain that the preparation of the first batch of treaties has encountered many difficulties, and these difficulties are by no means accidental. There is a desire among some foreigners to deprive the Soviet Union of its legitimate and glorious position in international affairs, and to damage the Soviet Union's international prestige, but only shortsighted reactionaries who are doomed to failure can do this. They are unwilling to understand how justified it is for the Soviet Union to occupy such a position in international relations, having shouldered the heavy responsibility of saving mankind from the tyranny of fascism, and how consistent it is with its efforts to strive for peace and the equal rights of large and small countries for security. The Soviet Union defends its reasonable interests and the principle of friendly cooperation with other democratic countries, and repels the reactionary attempts of imperialism, no matter where such attempts arise. We are fully convinced that the Soviet Union's policy aimed at defending peace and the cause of human progress is completely correct."

    莫洛托夫关于巴黎外长会议的总结声明
    【新华社延安二十九日电】莫斯科讯：真理报二十八日发表苏外长莫洛托夫关于巴黎外长会议的总结声明，其大要如下：
    （一）关于巴黎会议召开的根据及其成就的估计——莫洛托夫说，这是根据去年八月柏林会议及十二月莫斯科三外长会议的决定举行的。根据莫斯科会议的决定，关于对意、罗、保、匈、芬之和约问题，应在二强（而在对意和约上是四强）一致协议下，起草和约草案，起草完毕后，即召集和会，讨论对上述各国的和约。在巴黎会议上，苏联代表团的指导原则，便是认为必须精确履行上述决定。莫洛托夫说：在巴黎会议上，苏联代表团不能同意英国所支持的美国代表团的提议，即不管在筹备和约草案时是否达到预先的协议一致，就预先规定召集和会期限，因为这样一来，将发生如次的情况：比意在和会上，不是提出单一的对意和约草案，而是提出几个草案，这样参加和会的某一集团，势将签署某一种和约，而另一集团签署另一种和约，而实际上就是单一的和会完全失败。美国这个提议，不仅与柏林会议、与莫斯科会议历次决定相矛盾，而且一般地对于继续发展与巩固和平，与各民族友好关系的事业上，发生最不好的恶果，因而苏联代表团在会议上，曾努力求得在和约基本问题上可以协议一致的基础。应该承认，在这方面已达到某些积极的结果，虽然这些结果远不能认为是充分的。
    （二）关于意、罗、保、匈、芬各国和约的成就及其未决问题，莫洛托夫说：上述和约除经济问题未加讨论外，大体上已经完成。关于一切根本问题——领土、军事限制、赔款、及其他问题，负责准备这些和约的各国政府之间，已达到若干协议，这个成就之获得，主要由于苏联政府提议将已包括各附庸国基本义务的停战条款（中缺九字），这些停战条款，充分保证了盟国合法的利益，然而并不至于导向外国干涉这些国家的内政。莫洛托夫说：“上述和约中，尚未商妥的问题，主要是条约中经济方面的问题——即关于多瑙河贸易与通航等关系多瑙河各国切身利益的问题，在外长会议上已不止一次地讨论这一问题。苏联认为如果有人愿意多瑙河流域各国友好关系的话，那末这些问题不能没有这些国家的参加，即行讨论决定。多瑙河通航问题，首先是多瑙河流域各国自身的问题，而且不能仅在与个别的多瑙河国家的和约中来加以决定，要是某些非多瑙河国家擅自越权命令多瑙河流域各国照他们意志行事，不重视多瑙河各国利益，特别是多瑙河各盟国（如捷、南）的利益，就不能认为是正确的行动。”
    （三）对意和约问题的困难与分歧——莫洛托夫说：“这一个问题，情形更加复杂，基本的问题，是在赔款、殖民地处置、沿南边界、经济问题、及管制形式等问题的不同意见。”（１）关于赔款问题，莫洛托夫指出：“根据一九四一年至四二年间数十万意大利法西斯军队侵入苏联，并给予苏联的巨大损失和侵害，根据南斯拉夫、希腊及阿尔巴尼亚等国情况，以及苏联对战争末期民主的意大利参加盟国作战意义的重视，而要求意大利在六年之内，赔偿苏联一亿美元的不大数目（这是提醒大家对于侵略行为侵入他国的行动应给予处罚），同时苏联认为以赔款二亿美元给予南、希、阿等国，也是正确的。但是这个极其温和的要求，在巴黎会议上，仅获得法国代表团的支持，美国以及和他一道的英国代表团，都不支持苏联这些正当的要求，虽然远在柏林会议上，常提出赔款问题时，苏美英三国政府都认为把敌国海军作为战利品而不包括在赔款之内是正当的。可是现在却有，从意国战利品中指定一部为偿付苏联的赔款，对于遭受外国侵犯的国内人们，不能把整个事情只用几句同情话，同时还发出“忘掉赔款吧”的呼吁就算了事，这只能证明俄国谚语“饱汉不知饿汉饥”之正确性而已。同时，根据意国报纸上所声明的，大家已知道意大利为英美负担着庞大的占领费，这一项数达数十亿美元的占领费，只要稍微节省一点，就足以使意偿付苏联的赔款要求了。另一方面，我们也很知道，意大利工业正需要外来的定货，履行苏联所提的赔款要求，可以供给意大利工业数年的工资定货，而不致成为意国家预算的重大负担。然而，因为某种理由，美英方面恰恰是反对意国以货物运交苏联的办法以偿付赔款，说意国工业这样运货给苏是要靠美英以财政援助作为意大利本钱的，这种说法是毫无根据的。同时说意工业应被当作英美工业集团利益的附属品，也不能认为是正确的意国民族工业有其丰富的历史，而且现在也需要开辟一个簇簇而重要的发展远景，如果我们不受到干涉，苏联与意大利关于赔款问题，将无须特别困难，即可迅速达到协议。（２）关于殖民地处置问题。莫洛托夫说：“我们并不坚持的黎波里坦尼亚在数年内置于苏联单独托管下，或甚至置于与意国联合托管下，虽然这对于苏联船只在地中海航线上具有极大重要性，且将充分保证在短期内建立的黎波里坦尼亚民族独立的利益。法苏两国都愿将在意国殖民地置于意国自己托管下，意国在联合国的自主指导下，完成准备这些国家建立民族独立的任务。美代表团起初支持这一建议，但他们很快就放弃了这种反对英国代表团的立场，而苏联在这一问题上所作的让步，并没有得到应有的重视或公平的承认。在这一问题上，特别显明的是英美代表团通常都根据事先谈好的协议行事，这是违反其他国家全体的利益的。按照英方的草案，几乎意大利一切殖民地实际上都将落入英国控制之下，英国建议由的黎波里坦尼亚与昔兰尼加组成“利比亚的独立”，但英军不退出。又建议组成“大索马利兰”，其中包括意属索马利兰及阿比西尼亚两块领土在内，置于英国托管下。这样英国在北非与东北非获得了它权力的新扩张，因此这不仅牺牲了意大利，而且也牺牲了阿比西尼亚。这一计划如果实现，即足以进一步来巩固大不列颠在整个地中海与红海实际上的独占地位。莫洛托夫指出：“美国支持英国这一计划，一切不利于继续巩固英国在地中海垄断地位的建议，受到美国方面的坚决反对，这一问题就是这样没有得到解决。”（３）关于意国边界问题，莫洛托夫指出：“的里雅斯特命运的问题，也应当被认为是巴黎会议上的基本问题。”他说：“苏联代表团支援南国对朱理亚地区要求的正义性，但英美建议将朱理亚分成东西两部分，这是破坏南国重要的民族利益，对的港造成经济之严重的损害，这一问题没有解决。但很清楚的，这个问题要求在满足我们盟国南斯拉夫民族利益的精神下，立即达到协定。”（４）关于经济问题，莫洛托夫说：“这亦不能低估了这一问题的重要性，尤其是在其他和约中，亦存在着类似的经济问题时，更是如此。在准备和约过程中，似乎有一种危害着在战争中被削弱了的国家之倾向，即为英美资本企图使大小国家的经济都服从于其势力之下，并且把对这些国家的所谓经济援助，变成达到这种目的的工具。它们辩护这种利益，它们常常提出取消对贸易及其他等限制的好处，以及允许外国资本自由行动等论据。同时，苏联代表团不能不顾及前附庸国而现在已走上了民主发展与经济复兴道路之国家的利益，因为苏联不能拥护强使任何国家在经济上服从其他国家的企图，决不能把意国这类国家看成殖民地，由巨大列强实行其霸权，而根本不管这些国家的民族利益。”（５）关于管制问题，莫洛托夫说：“根据美国的草案，在意国中美英苏法四国代表组织‘条约委员会’，该委员会应在签订和约后十几个月内，执行和约上关于军事、赔款、恢复原状、追究战犯问题方面所规定的职权。”莫洛托夫指出：“该委员会在外国民主国家的国土上握有特别广泛的权力，这是与意国国家主张根本不相容的，这是很象对意国施行‘降服统治’，也是与减轻停战条款的建议相矛盾的。在和约签订后，应为意国开辟参加联合国组织的道路，因此这一问题，亦未达到协议，但亦可以相信，进一步的深思熟虑，将使提出这一计划的人，感到坚持设立‘条约委员会’是不适宜的。”
    （四）关于德国问题——莫洛托夫说：“这个问题，曾依照法国的提议加以讨论，但是会议并未展开讨论法国合并鲁尔、莱茵及萨尔各省的要求；另方面，美国代表团提议讨论所谓四强关于解除德国二十五军武装的条约草案，这个草案是根据臭名远扬的美国参议员范登堡的著名建议的精神拟就的。关于此点，贝纳斯指出远在去年十二月当他在莫斯科时，曾询问斯大林对缔结此种条约的态度，并且说曾得到斯大林原则上的同意。然而人们应当牢记着，贝纳斯在这里是做了多少不大确实的声明，因为那时贝纳斯还没有此种草案，所以斯大林也不能对这一不存在的条约表示什么‘同意’。实际上，当时只是简单地交换了一下关于万一德国或日本的侵略死灰复燃时互助条约的意见而已，而后来贝纳斯所提的草案，根本未提到实行互助以反对德日侵略的问题，只是提到解除武装问题，而且为了某种理由，不提盟国在德黑兰黑雅尔塔和柏林历次会议上通过的关于德国问题的许多最重要的决定，而因此可能引起减弱以预防德国侵略死灰复燃为目的的盟国管制机构，当然这种减弱是绝对不能容许的。因此，在会议上，苏联建议这种条约草案先交有关各国政府加以研究，而不应该急于做出决定。况且贝纳斯说，这个条约只能在对德和约签字后始能生效，那就更不应该急忙决定了，因为德国现在连续与盟国签订和约的政府之胚胎还没有。会议最后通过了苏联的另一建议，即在讨论上述条约之前，先检查一下盟国过去关于解除德国武装的决议之执行情形，这一检查工作，现在已由德境盟国管委会在考虑设立一委员会去执行。恰好在巴黎会议闭幕的前夜，贝纳斯又提出了另一个更加重突的建议，要求在今年十一日召集盟国会议，讨论对德国和约问题。关于这点，人们可以回想到，苏联政府首脑斯大林远在去年七月柏林会议上，就曾提出关于独立某种德国中央行政机构的建议，当时英美都反对讨论这个问题，从那时以来，谁也没有提过这一问题。因此贝纳斯的建议，没有被会议通过。”
    （五）关于巴黎会议总结的意义——莫洛托夫指出：“会议总结，表明在讨论出五个和约草案时与四强之间有某些分歧，现在显露出来，在由苏联担负主要责任的对罗、匈、保、芬和约草案上，仅有某些不应该夸大的意见分歧。至于英美担负主要责任的对意和约上，许多重大的问题，依然未达到协议。在这里，苏联又作了若干步骤，以求达到普遍的协议。这样做，也最终将促进对这一和约草案达到协议。”“会议表明了在准备和约中，也存在着完全不良的倾向。原来美国某些人士所宣布的所谓‘和平攻势’（按贝纳斯二十日夜间广播中曾有此宣布），只是表现以某两国政府强迫第三国政府服从它们的意见而已，比方对意大利殖民地命运的问题，就是如此。苏联在这个问题上，放弃了自己的要求，然而英美两代表团形成一个集团，就毫无达到一致协议的希望了。在赔款问题上，也是一样，他们在这里，也不是进行什么‘和平攻势’而是进行对苏攻势，而英美代表团既然结成集团，企图强迫苏联服从他们的意志，就完全不愿估计苏联最合理的愿望，而且破坏了赔款问题上达到共同协议的可能。”“巴黎会议还表明了某些国家曾强使他国服从其意志的企图，受到自然的反击。当然，无论那一个自尊的盟国，都不会让其他国家由意志强施在自己的头上，苏联自然不会例外。另一方面，苏联充分表现自己是迫切愿望与其他国家一致行动的。在战时，为了盟国的胜利，在战后，为了保证持久的和平与世界各国的安全。有时人们说很难划分对于安全的愿望与扩张主义的愿望的界限（按贝纳斯上述广播就这样主张），诚然，有时是很难的，例如美国是由于什么安全愿望才要求在冰岛建立军事基地的呢？显而易见，这决不是什么美国的安全问题，而是完全另外的一种动机。全世界报纸都登载这样的消息，说美国某些人士与他们的英国朋友结成一个集团，企图在地球上一切地方，在太平洋、大西泮的岛屿上，在西半球与东半球各国的领土上，建立海陆军航空基地。怪不得在某些国家内主张由最强国之一来实行新的帝国主义的世界霸权的人，身价百倍，而且也顾不得身为参议员或众议员的官方地位与什么不便之处，就大事鼓吹他们的扩张计划，煽动着新的侵略战争。而对于帝国主义德国统治世界计划之不光荣崩溃的教训，也竟能熟视无睹。将来不是属于这些老爷们的，而是属于像苏联那样愿望持久和平并把它们本国安全的利益与其他爱好和平国家安全的利益打成一片的国家的。某些强国想强迫他国服从其意志的努力，将来也还会有，但是要对苏联也这么干，那末无论过去或将来，都必然注定要遭受惨败。只有友谊合作的愿望，在这里没有任何迫使另一国听命于另一国或另两国的余地，才能成为苏维埃国家与其他国家间关系发展的可靠基础。可以不无怀疑，这些国际合作原则，也必将受到其他民主国中日益增长的认识。大家知道，战争时期在同盟各国间，曾发展了通过一致决议时的确定程序，不仅一九四三年的莫斯科会议，而且在德黑兰、雅尔塔及在柏林等历次会议上，曾就非常重要的问题，一致通过了大家都同意的决定，这些决定并不是在某一国受他国强迫服从其意志的情况下通过的，而是在友谊和洽相谅解的情况下通过的，这一合作的方法，已获得积极的成果，现在某些人士力图破坏这种程序，他们经常活动企图破坏这一证明有效的工作方法，在巴黎会议上，提议不要等待四强对和约草案的一致协议，即行召开和会，到那里去开始争论与斗争，苏联代表团拒斥了这种想破坏盟国共同工作的既定原则的企图。在巴黎会议之后，贝纳斯提出了新的更远大的计划（指上述贝氏的广播），提议将那些没有达到协议的草案交给联合国组织来讨论，虽然大家知道联合国组织对和约问题没有关系，这又是一个想破坏最近几年来所建立的共同工作的程序的企图，想利用压力威胁、恐惑方法的企图，但对苏联要用这种办法，显然而且已历次证明是毫无用处的。可是，这些企图说明了某些外国人士有一种强烈的愿望，力图破坏盟国共同工作的原则，并且试图凭借与各国间正常关系不相容的办法，来对付苏联及其他民主国，想拿联合国组织来作这一企图的工具，是众所周知的了。假使愿甘冒不韪以利用国家组织的联合投票之策略，而破坏联合国组织的威信话，那就可以做这种事情，我们现在已有了这种情形的例子。不可否认，安理会的威信已经遭受到严重的考验了。”
    （六）结束语——莫洛托大最后说：“这一切都可以说明准备第一批和约已经遇到了不少的困难，这些困难绝非偶然的，在某些外国人士中有一种愿望，力图剥夺苏联在国际事务中所正当且有的光荣地位，并使苏联的国际威信遭受损失，但是这只有注定要失败的眼光如豆的反动分子，才能这样做。他们不愿了解苏联既然担负了挽救人类免受法西斯暴政的斗争之重担，在国际关系中占据这样的地位该是如何的正当，该是如何地符合其力谋争取和平与安全的大小国家平等权的利益。苏联在保卫自己的合理利益及其他民主国家友好合作的原则下，并对帝国主义之反动企图给以回击，不管这种企图在那里产生，我们充分相信苏联以保卫和平与人类进步事业为目的的政策，完全是正确的”。
