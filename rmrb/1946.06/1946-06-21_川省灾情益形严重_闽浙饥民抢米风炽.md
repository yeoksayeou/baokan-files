Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th. According to the Shanghai Wenhui Daily of June 4th, the disaster situation in Sichuan Province is becoming increasingly serious. According to recent statistics, out of more than 130 counties in the province, 116 counties have been affected by the disaster, with 30 million victims, all subsisting on tree bark, grass roots, and Guanyin soil. The direct cause of the famine is that the Nationalist government authorities requisitioned 21.6 million shi of public grain from Sichuan last year, accounting for a quarter of the total harvest in Sichuan Province, resulting in empty food supplies for the people. Recently, the Ministry of Food plans to transport all of the so-called "surplus grain" of 2 million shi from Sichuan, using 80 American landing craft and Sichuan River demobilized ships, plus forced transportation methods, for internal warfare, which will add fuel to the already serious Sichuan disaster.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th. According to the Shanghai Da Wan Bao of May 14th, a rice-grabbing frenzy occurred in Xiamen on April 22nd. Posters calling on famine victims to seize rice were pasted on street poles, stating: "Xiamen rice merchants have black hearts, the poor people are about to eat tree bark and grass roots, the people who have no food should quickly grab [rice]." According to the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao of May 18th, a rice-grabbing frenzy also occurred in Huangyan, a rice-producing area in Zhejiang. The people of Huangyan have been extremely panicked recently due to the impact of prices. In late April, crowds of famine victims went to rice shops to seize rice. The elderly and helpless took off their pants and used them to fill with rice at the rice buckets, while the young and strong carried entire bags of rice away. After seizing one place, they went to another.

　　川省灾情益形严重
    闽浙饥民抢米风炽
    【新华社延安十七日电】据六月四日沪文汇报载，四川省灾情益形严重。据最近统计：全省一百三十余县中，受灾者达一百十六县，灾民三千万，咸以树皮、草根、观音土果腹。饥荒造成之直接原因，是四川去年被国民党当局征借公粮达二千一百六十万石，占四川省全部收获的四分之一，以致民食空虚。最近粮食部更计划将川省所谓“余粮”二百万石，用美国登陆艇八十艘及川江复员航轮，再加力运方法，全部运出，作为内战之用，益使严重之川灾火上添油。
    【新华社延安十七日电】据五月十四日沪大晚报载，厦门于四月二十二日发生抢米风潮。街头电杆上贴有饥民号召抢米的标语，内称：“厦门米商黑良心，贫民将食树皮草根，没吃食的民好快抢。”又据五月十八日沪大公报载：浙江产米区黄岩，亦发生抢米风潮。黄岩民众近因受物价影响，极度恐慌。四月下旬，饥民群至米铺中抢米，年老无助者，在米桶边脱下裤子装米，年轻力壮者，则将米整袋背走。抢完一处，又到一处。
