[Heze News, our newspaper] In order to thoroughly mobilize the masses in the new liberated areas and concentrate efforts to complete the task of liberating the masses, the JiluYu Huxi District mobilized more than 4,300 cadres from the old liberated areas in May (of whom 70% were village cadres) to mobilize the masses in 46 districts of the eleven newly liberated counties (including Yutai, Pei, Shan, Juye, Jinxiang, Chengwu, Shanyu, Dangshan, Huashan, Peitong, and Feng counties). After more than half a month of efforts, the masses in 33 districts have been initially mobilized. In Pei County, four of the six districts have universally carried out struggles, and 60% of the masses have been organized. The remaining two districts have also broken through the central areas. Yutai County has the largest scale, with struggles universally launched in nine districts. After the mass struggle in Chengguan District, more than 200 *shi* of grain that had been embezzled was returned to the masses, and the enthusiasm for struggle is growing. In Shanyu County, two districts have 23 work teams leading the effort, and only two teams have not yet broken through, while the other teams are smoothly unfolding the struggle. The Chengguan District of Shan County has developed rapidly, with more than 700 people already organized. Taking the entire Huxi District as a whole, a new situation has been opened up, and everywhere you can see the masses fighting against traitors and local bullies, exposing their various crimes, setting off "turnover cannons," and parading traitors and local bullies through the streets. The masses are venting their extreme hatred for them with great satisfaction. The democratic government has adopted a policy of thoroughly supporting the masses, arresting the most heinous traitors and local bullies, and allowing the masses to hold public trials and accuse them at mass meetings, and the judgments are mostly based on the opinions of the masses. For some of the less important elements, a temporary organizational form of "repentance centers" is adopted to win over many people to repent and start anew. With the support and encouragement of the government, the masses are universally holding struggle meetings with five or six thousand people. Some villages go to the market in the morning and come back in the afternoon to hold meetings to settle accounts and pour out grievances; others have a dozen villages holding struggle meetings simultaneously in one day to settle accounts with the traitors and local bullies who secretly ruled the villages. In the past half month, the morale of the masses and cadres has been generally improved, and the cadres have also seen the results of their work and have gained confidence in their work. The masses said: "This time it's going to work (it's going to be alright)! We will really carry it through to the end!"

[Another dispatch] The mass movement in the Huxi District in May, which focused on settling accounts and pouring out grievances, has achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics from 18 districts in eight counties, including Pei, Yutai, Feng, Peitong, Dangshan, Shanyu, Jinxiang, and Chengwu, 60,286 people have been organized, and eight districts have almost eliminated "white board villages" [unliberated villages], and some districts have organized 30% to 50% of the entire population of the villages. In terms of the fruits obtained, there are 21,897 *mu* of land, 2,669,730 *jin* of grain, 18,592,600 yuan, and more than 10,000 *chi* of cloth. ... The broad masses have not only turned over politically, but have also initially solved the problems of clothing, food, and housing. Currently, the leadership has put forward the slogan: "We must deepen and promote the movement and launch an even greater movement!" And call on activists who have already turned over to develop to other villages and break through unmobilized villages. In the future, the entire Huxi District plans to eliminate all "white board villages" and organize 60% of the entire population within two months. Recently, a cadres' meeting was held during the wheat harvest season to arrange for a more in-depth and extensive mass movement.

    湖西区十一县群运蓬勃
    政府坚决撑腰作主，干部群众信心提高，都说：“这回可中啦！”
    【本报荷泽讯】冀鲁豫湖西区为彻底发动新区群众，集中力量完成群众翻身任务，五月份调动了老区干部四千三百余人（其中村干部占百分之七十），到新解放区的十一个县（包括鱼台、沛县、单县、巨野、金乡、城武、单虞、砀山、华山、沛铜、丰县等）四十六个区去发动群众，经过半月多的努力，已经有三十三个区的群众初步发动起来。沛县六个区，已有四个区普遍进行斗争，百分之六十的群众已组织起来。其余两个区也已突破中心区，鱼台县规模最大，九个区普遍掀起了斗争。城关区经过群众斗争后，把贪污粮食二百多石退给了群众，斗争情绪正益趋高涨。单虞县二个区，即有二十三个工作组进行领导，现在只有两个组没突开，其它组正顺利展开了斗争。单县城关区发展较快，已组织起七百多人。以全湖西来说，已打开了新局面，到处可以看到群众在同汉奸恶霸进行斗争，揭发他们的各种罪恶，放着翻身炮，拉着汉奸恶霸游街。群众对他们的极端愤恨，痛快的倾泻出来。民主政府采取了彻底为群众撑腰的政策，把罪大恶极的汉奸恶霸，拘捕起来，让群众开大会公审控诉，在判决上多依照群众意见。对一部次要分子，则采取“悔过所”的临时组织形式，争取了不少人悔过自新。群众在政府的支持与鼓舞下，普遍的举行着五六千人的斗争大会。有的村上午赶集，下午回来开大会清算，诉苦；有的是十几个村在一天之内同时开斗争大会，向各村明暗统治的汉奸恶霸算账。半月以来，群众与干部的情绪普遍提高了，干部也看到了工作的成绩，对工作有了信心。群众说：“这回可中啦（行啦）！真要干到底哩！”
    【又讯】五月份湖西区清算诉苦为主的群众运动，已获得很大成绩，据沛县、鱼台、丰县、沛铜、砀山、单虞、金乡、城武等八个县之十八个区不完全统计，已经组织起群众六万零二百八十六人，有八个区已近乎消灭了白板村，有的区村已组织了全民百分之三十至五十。在获得果实方面，有土地二万一千八百九十七亩，粮食二百六十六万九千七百三十斤，钱一千八百五十九万二千六百余元，布一万多尺。……广大群众不但在政治上翻了身，而且也初步解决了衣食住等问题。目前领导上提出口号：“要加深推广，掀起更大的运动！”并号召已翻身的积极分子向外村发展，突破未发动村庄。今后全湖西区打算在两个月内，消灭所有白板村，组织起全民的百分之六十。最近已利用麦期召开了干部会，布置更加深入广泛的群众运动。
