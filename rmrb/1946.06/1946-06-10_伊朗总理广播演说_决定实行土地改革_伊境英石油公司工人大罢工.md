Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: Tehran dispatch: Iranian Prime Minister Sultani delivered a radio address on the 6th stating that he has decided to begin implementing various reforms, including land distribution and the limitation of land ownership. Sultani stated: In the past two months, I have concentrated on clarifying relations with the Soviet Union. Now that Soviet-Iranian relations have been established on a basis of friendship, and foreign troops have withdrawn from our territory, I have decided to begin implementing reforms. Unfortunately, certain conservative and self-serving individuals are conspiring against our country's freedom. They say that by distributing land and limiting land ownership, I am destroying private property rights. This statement is incorrect. What I am doing is to meet the needs of the nation's poor farmers and prevent the waste of thousands of acres of land. Our economic policy will be changed to adapt to the current world situation. Healthcare and education will be improved. Sultani emphasized that the Azerbaijan issue must be resolved first in order to begin implementing reforms. He said: I am now dedicated to this plan and ask all who love freedom to unite and help.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: Tehran dispatch: Workers at the British-capitalized British Petroleum Company's Tehran branch went on strike on the 3rd. In sympathy with the major strike of over 10,000 workers at the company in southern Iran, Tehran had no oil to use all day, and buses and other vehicles were out of service. According to a Moscow broadcast citing Iranian sources, the major strike of oil workers in southern Iran began in early May because Iranian workers were subjected to inhuman treatment by foreign bosses.

    伊朗总理广播演说
    决定实行土地改革
    伊境英石油公司工人大罢工
    【新华社延安七日电】德黑兰讯：伊朗总理苏尔丹尼六日发表广播演说称：他决定着手实行各种改革工作，包括土地分配，及限制土地所有权。苏尔丹尼称：过去两个月中，我曾集中力量于澄清对苏关系，现在苏伊关系既然已建立在友谊之上，外国军队已撤出我国领土，我便决定着手实行改革。很不幸的是某些保守的与自私自利的人，正阴谋反对我国的自由，他们说由于分配土地，及限制土地所有权，我正在捣毁私有财产权。这种说法是不对的。我所做的在于满足全国贫苦农民的需要，防止成千亩土地的荒芜。我们的经济政策将予改变，以适应目前世界的形势。保健及教育工作，将予改进。苏尔丹曾强调阿塞拜疆问题必须先解决，以便能开始实行改革。他说：我现在致力于这个计划，并要求一切爱好自由者团结起来，加以帮助。
    【新华社延安七日电】德黑兰讯：英国资本的英国石油公司德黑兰分行工人，三日罢工。同情伊朗南部该公司万余工人的大罢工，德黑兰竟日无油使用，公共汽车及其他车辆均停驶。据莫斯科广播引伊朗的消息称：伊南部石油工人的大罢工，自五月初旬即开始，原因是伊朗工人遭受外国老板非人的虐待。
