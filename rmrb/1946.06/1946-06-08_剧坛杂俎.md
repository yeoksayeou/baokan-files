The people of Handan have had a great treat these past few days. The Literary and Art Troupe's historical drama "Driven to Join Liangshan" was previewed at the Senate Auditorium on the evening of the 2nd. On the 4th and 5th, performances continued to entertain the troops. Starting from the 9th, it will be performed publicly at the Handan Theater. Those who have seen one or two performances have noticed that each performance is better than the last. During the preview, the expressions in the "Exile" and "Wild Boar Forest" scenes were not realistic enough, but this improved on the 5th. As they become more familiar with it, excellent results are naturally expected. It is heard that the troupe also plans to stage "Lin Xiangru" and "Blood Feud" soon to entertain the audience.

The Handan Theater is currently working day and night and should be ready for the Literary and Art Troupe to perform "Driven to Join Liangshan" on the 9th. It will officially open at the end of the month. The theater manager, Mr. Lü Ban, said that once all the construction is completed, it will be available for rent by various theater troupes. He said that film projectors will arrive soon, but films are relatively difficult to obtain. He also plans to invite local theater workers to form an amateur theater troupe. Perhaps they themselves may hire a Peking opera troupe.

What kind of plays do city people really like to watch? The Xinhua Theater Troupe's productions of "Mulan Joins the Army," "Transformation of a Loafer," and "Spring Peach" have been very popular with the masses. After the playbill for "Transformation of a Loafer" was posted, ticket sales immediately increased by a third. However, there are too few new plays. Currently, most are still Peking Opera, Bangzi Opera, and Ping Opera, and the content of many of these plays is no longer suitable for performance today. A gentleman with experience in drama said that there are two ways to change this situation: First, remove the supernatural and ghostly parts, modify certain inappropriate phrases, and prohibit the performance of plays that are obscene, promote theft, or promote feudal ideology. Second, use new perspectives and methods to write more Peking Opera scripts with new content, such as "Driven to Join Liangshan." This is a big problem, and it is hoped that the vast number of theater workers will make urgent efforts.

It is estimated that the daily sales of theater tickets in Handan are unlikely to exceed two thousand. At twenty-five yuan per ticket, this is fifty thousand yuan. The "Xinhua Theater Troupe," which was stationed in the city, has gone to Fengfeng, and the "New Life Theater Troupe" from southern Hebei and the "People's Theater Troupe" from Wu'an, Taihang, have arrived in Handan. The "New Life" began performing on the 3rd and sold more than thirty thousand yuan in one performance.

The theatrical movement in Taihang is active. The Guangming Theater Troupe's newly written "Organize" was performed at the end of last month at the administrative office's location and received good reviews from all parties. The administrative office and the district party committee have offered prizes to solicit plays for "Three Hundred Years Since Jia Shen" and "The Arch-Traitor Yuan Shikai." They have already received three versions of the former written by Wang Fouding, Miao Peishi, and Dong Shu, among others. They have already received one version of the latter written by Mu Zhou. Miao's version of "Three Hundred Years Since Jia Shen" has been test-performed five times in Xingtai City.

    剧坛杂俎
    邯郸人这几天眼福极好，文工团排演的历史名剧《逼上梁山》，于二日晚在参议会大礼堂预演。四、五两日继续演出慰劳部队。从九日起，将在邯郸剧院公演。看过一、二两次演出的人，都发觉一次比一次演的好些。预演时“刺配”及“野猪林”两场表情不够十分逼真，五日这一次就有了进步，今后因熟生巧，优良效果自在意中。闻该团不久尚拟排演《蔺相如》与《血泪仇》，以飨观众。

    邯郸剧院现正昼夜赶工，九日可供文工团公演“逼上梁山”，月底将正式开业。该院经理吕班氏说：一俟全部工程完竣，即可供各剧团租用。他说：电影放映机不久即可运到，惟影片比较困难。他还计划邀集本市戏剧工作者，成立一个业余剧团。也许，他们自己可能延聘一个平剧团。

    城市里的人究竟爱看什么戏？新华剧团排演了《木兰从军》、《二流子转变》、《春桃》三剧，大受群众欢迎。《二流子转变》的戏目贴出后，戏票马上多卖了三分之一。但是，新戏究竟太少了，目前绝大部分还是皮黄、梆子、平剧，这些剧本的内容，有许多在今天已经不宜演出了。对于戏剧富有经验的某君说，改变这种现象有两种办法：一、把出神出鬼的地方删去，某些不适宜的词句加以修改，至于诲淫诲盗，宣传封建思想的剧本则禁止演出。二、用新的观点方法多写些新内容的平剧剧本如《逼上梁山》者。这个问题是很大的，希望广大的戏剧工作者急起努力。

    据估计，邯郸每日销售戏票，很难超过两千张。以每张二十五元计，为五万元，现在长驻本市的“新华剧团”去了峰峰，冀南的“新生剧团”、太行武安的“人民剧团”到了邯郸。“新生”于三日开始公演，一场就卖了三万余元。

    太行剧运活跃，光明剧团新编《组织起来》，上月底在行署驻地上演，获得各方好评。该行署与区党委悬奖征求《甲申三百年祭》《窃国大盗袁世凯》两剧作，前者已收到王否定、苗培时、董树等所写的三种。后者已收到穆周所写的一种。苗本《甲申三百年祭》已在邢台市试演五次。
