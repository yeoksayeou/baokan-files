Xinhua News Agency, Yangcheng, 13th: Our troops, forced to defend themselves, have continuously repulsed attacks by Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's troops along the Tongpu Railway line, achieving initial victories. Our frontline reporter reports: In early June, Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's troops, coordinating with the offensive in southern Shanxi, invaded areas along our Tongpu Railway line as many as 41 times. On the 5th of this month, two battalions of the 218th Regiment of Yan Xishan's 73rd Division in Lingshi, along with more than 1,000 local armed personnel, invaded our liberated areas of Jingsheng Town and Mahe Village in three routes from Lingshi's Shuitou, and continued to intrude into Zhangsong, Huaishuzhuang and other places. Our troops resolutely defended themselves, first driving back the Yan Xishan troops who invaded Jingjie and Jiguang. By the 10th, Maying in the county was also recovered by us. The entire Second Battalion of the 218th Regiment of Yan Xishan's troops was wiped out, capturing 210 enemy soldiers including the battalion commander, one mortar, 18 light and heavy machine guns, five grenade launchers, and more than 60 rifles. On the 4th, 500 soldiers from the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of Yan Xishan's 44th Division in Jiexiu invaded Baohe, and continued to intrude into our territory. Our troops rose up in anger to fight back, inflicting heavy losses on the invading troops. The next day, Baohe was recovered by us. On the 6th, more than 600 Yan Xishan soldiers from Huoxian County attempted to invade Jinbi and other places but failed, and Yan Xishan's troops suffered more than 50 casualties. On the same day, more than 700 soldiers from the 197th Regiment of Yan Xishan's 66th Division in Hongdong also attacked Yongning and other places. On the 9th, they again attacked Fengbao, Gu County and other places, but were all repelled by our defending troops. Yan Xishan's troops in Quwo, Wenxi, Jiang County and other places also used hundreds of armed men, combined with local secret agents, to frantically surround and raid our border villages every day, but they were all repelled by our heroic defending troops. From the 5th to the 10th alone, Yan Xishan's troops in the three counties suffered more than 130 casualties.
