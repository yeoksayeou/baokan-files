    Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 6th: Beiping Dispatch: Wang Zhixiang, Wang Shiling, Wang Weiqi, Fang Shu, Shi Dachuan, Jiang Shaoyuan, Guang Weiran, Shen Jiayi, Zhou Gaowen, Zhou Shujia, Meng Gongmen, Lin Baoluo, Jin Dingxin, Su Zhonghui, Yao Tuizhi, Ma Yanxiang, Xu Yudian, Xu Ying, Chen Jinkun, Chen Zhixiang, Liang Qiushui, Lu Xian, Fu Yuwei, Sun Zhongyuan, Sheng Jialun, Zhang Dongsun, Zhang Zhongxing, Zhang Shenfu, Zeng Zhaolun, Wan Renqian, Peng Zigang, Huang Xinshu, Yang Dazhang, Dong Qiushui, Xiong Huiqi, Liu Ruilin, Liu Weijun, Liu Qingyang, Lu Naigeng, Lu Xiangting and other 42 figures from all circles in Beiping issued a declaration on May 28, calling for an immediate and unconditional cessation of the civil war. The declaration firstly pointed out: "Because of the continuation of the civil war in the Northeast, the nationwide civil war is in a state of imminent eruption." It continued: The people of the Northeast under the artillery fire cannot bear the spread of the war, which directly causes the death and displacement of millions of people, and indirectly aggravates the people's spiritual distress, material poverty, and hardship in life. This is unbearable at present. The country is being destroyed again and again after destruction, which will inevitably lead to the extinction of vitality and eternal doom. This is unbearable forever. Severe famine in Hunan and Guangdong, with thousands of residents dying of starvation in major cities every day, the crisis of total collapse is imminent. To continue the civil war is truly unbearable. The declaration shouted: "The common people cannot bear it in a hundred ways!" The declaration stated: "Warmongers stubbornly want to indulge in military aggression for their own amusement, which makes us angry! The brave Chinese soldiers who have endured eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan and tasted all kinds of hardships are now forced to kill each other with another group of compatriots who swore to resist Japan behind enemy lines, making shameful sacrifices, which makes us grieved and indignant!" It also stated: "Currently, there is no foreign aggression or foreign trouble. No one or any party has the right to drive the people to kill each other. The people have the right to oppose all civil wars; opposing all civil wars is also the people's duty." Civil war should and must be stopped unconditionally. For example, when saving a fire, it is absolutely not allowed to bargain leisurely at the fire site. The declaration believes that the proposition of conditional ceasefire is in fact equivalent to insisting on not ceasing the war. The declaration also appealed to the warmongers, asking them to have great kindness and great wisdom, lay down their butcher knives, and save the catastrophe; hoping to immediately implement the ceasefire order, and the Northeast Ceasefire Agreement of March 27. Finally, it also called on compatriots across the country to unite, unanimously oppose civil war, and stop civil war, stop those who launch civil war and refuse to cease fire! Our slogan is: Immediately stop the nationwide civil war; the Northeast civil war should no longer continue!

    北平各界名流呼吁
    无条件停止全国内战
    警告黩武者放下屠刀救民水火
    【新华社张家口六日电】北平讯：平市各界王之相、王石冷、王伟杞、方枢、石大川、江绍源、光未然、沈家彝、周郜文、周叔迦、孟拱门、林葆骆、金鼎忻、宿仲晖、姚退之、马彦祥、徐域电、徐盈、陈瑾昆、陈之骧、梁秋水、陆弦、符宇微、孙中原、盛家伦、张东荪、张中行、张申府、曾昭抡、万仞千、彭子冈、黄心束、杨达章、董秋水、熊烩琦、刘瑞林、刘威军、刘清扬、卢乃赓、卢香亭等四十二人，于五月二十八日发表宣言，呼吁立即无条件的停止内战。该宣言首先指出：“因为东北内战的继续，使全国的内战有随时一触即发之势”。继称：炮火下的东北人民，受不了战火的蔓延，直接使千百万人民死伤流离，间接加重人民精神上的苦闷，物质上的贫乏，生活上的艰窘，这是当前受不了。国家在破坏之余，再加破坏，必使生机尽绝，万劫不复，这是永久的受不了。湘粤各地粮荒严重，大都市的居民饿死者，日以千计，总崩溃的危机，迫在眉睫，如再进行内战，这是实实在在的受不了。宣言中高呼：“老百姓一百个受不了”！宣言中称：“好战分子固执地要逞兵黩武以自娱，这使我们忿怒！身经八年抗战，备尝艰苦的中华健儿，现在都被迫的与另一部分曾在敌后誓死抗日的同胞相砍相杀，作可耻的牺牲，这使我们悲愤！”并称：“当前不是外侮外患，任何人或任何党派，没有驱使人民自相残杀的道理，人民有反对一切内战的权利；反对一切内战，也是人民的义务”。内战应该而且必须无条件的停止，譬如救火灾，绝不容在火场上从容讲价，宣言中认为有条件的停战主张，事实上等于坚持不停战。宣言中并向好战分子呼吁，要求他们发大善心，运大智慧，放下屠刀，挽回浩劫；希望立即实行停战命令，与三月二十七日东北停战协定。最后，并号召全国同胞团结起来，一致反对内战，制止内战，制止那些发动内战而又拒绝停战的人们！我们的口号是：立刻制止全国的内战，东北内战不应再继续下去！
