    [This Newspaper Weixian, 12th Dispatch] Our armies in Southern Hebei and Bohai jointly entered De County, an important town in the Hebei-Shandong-Tianjin-Pukou area, on the evening of the 10th. The more than 5,000 puppet troops under the command of the traitor Yang Yu＠, who had entrenched themselves in the city, were all dispersed and disarmed. Traitor Yang was originally the biggest war criminal in Shandong, having served as the enemy puppet governor of Shandong Province. After the enemy's surrender, he was appointed commander of the Shandong Advance Army by the Kuomintang, which made Traitor Yang even more rampant. After the ceasefire order, he continued to attack our liberated areas of Southern Hebei and Bohai. In the months of February and March alone, he launched four large-scale offensives against our Southern Hebei area, sending special agents to assassinate and poison, resulting in the death of more than 400 people. More than 40 of our soldiers were also poisoned, and five sentries were wounded. Recently, incited by the Kuomintang reactionaries' policy of expanding the civil war, this puppet force has become even more egregious, building fortifications and pillboxes, and actively preparing to attack us. Our army, at the request of hundreds of thousands of people on the Shandong-Hebei border, rose up to defend itself. On the evening of the 7th, in coordination with our army in the Bohai area, we launched a counterattack against Traitor Yang in De County. By the evening of the 10th, all of Traitor Yang's forces had been dispersed and disarmed, and De County was liberated. When this puppet force was being disarmed, the Kuomintang desperately helped the puppet troops with airplanes, bombing and strafing our army five times on the 9th and 10th, and dropping several bombs on civilian houses, causing considerable damage to residents. After this liberation, the people of the entire city rejoiced wildly, and order within the city has been quickly restored.
    [This Newspaper Handan, 12th Dispatch] After more than 3,000 soldiers of the Yan Army in Southern Shanxi, including Wang Haiqing and Lei Wenqing, refused orders to fight in the civil war and staged an uprising against the civil war, they have now, with the assistance of the military and civilians in the liberated areas, established the Southern Shanxi People's Self-Rescue Army, with Wang Haiqing and Lei Wenqing serving as commander and deputy commander, respectively. Under the call of Commander and Deputy Commander Wang Haiqing and Lei Wenqing, five regiments of Yan's army in Southern Shanxi have so far withdrawn from the civil war. All five regiments are now under the jurisdiction of the Southern Shanxi People's Self-Rescue Army and have safely transferred to our liberated areas, joining forces with our Eighth Route Army to smash the large-scale offensive by the Jiang-Yan armies against the Southern Shanxi liberated area.
