　　Counterfeit Money Discovered in Tangyin
　　[Our newspaper's Changzhi report] Counterfeit Ji banknotes have been discovered in the market town of Hebi in Tangyin. The color of the bills is pale and blurry, and the serial numbers are chaotic. An investigation revealed that this batch of counterfeit money came from Tangyin, causing significant losses to merchants. Previously, the local militia in that town had apprehended three plainclothes spies disguised as small merchants coming from Tangyin, who were carrying over 300,000 yuan in this type of counterfeit Ji banknotes.
