Criticism and Suggestions

    Demobilized Soldiers Returning Home Should Participate in Mass Movements
    To the Editor:
    Currently, as demobilized soldiers return home, if county and district cadres can pay attention to properly handling their integration with the masses, not only will the mass movement gain a powerful assistant, but the individual’s resettlement problems can also be solved.
    Guo Xiaochang, a retired soldier from Shangzhuang Village, Sixth District of Yongnian, used to be a platoon leader in the 385th Brigade. After returning home and settling down, he actively engaged in production and raised a flock of sheep. During the mobilization of the masses, he led the villagers in carrying out the struggle for emancipation, gaining more than 30,000 catties of millet as a result of the struggle. Many poor households used this grain to purchase land. Guo has now been elected as the director of the village farmers' association. Also, Sun Anbang from Dengshang Village, who returned home from the Independent Battalion due to illness, serves as the village militia captain, leading the militia on night sentry duty, working very actively, and greatly helping the work in the village. In Dayou Village, the demobilized soldier Dai Zhao only, when he first returned home, did not receive proper arrangements or handling, and did not integrate well with the village work and the masses. He drifted around selling cigarettes and did not help with the village work; later, he participated in the mass movement, served as the militia captain, and led the masses in armed defense. The village work was helped, and he also felt that he had something to rely on by being with the masses. I suggest that the government and the army, in the repatriation certificates issued to demobilized soldiers, should include information about their work experience and specialties, so that they can be properly handled. Demobilized soldiers should also carry forward the fine traditions of the People's Army and serve the masses. This will indeed be a great help to the village work and the current mass movement.

    复员军人返乡应参加群众运动编辑先生：
    当前复员军人返乡，县区干部如能注意适当处理使与群众相结合，不但群运得一有力助手，他个人安家问题也可得到解决。
    永年六区上庄村的荣退军人郭小常，他曾任过三八五旅的排长，回去安家以后积极生产，放了一群羊。发动群众时，他领导全村群众展开翻身斗争，共获得斗争果实小米三万余斤，许多贫苦户拿了这些粮食置成地，现郭已当选为该村农会主任。还有邓上村孙安邦，因病从独立营回家，充当该村民兵队长，夜间率领民兵放哨，工作很积极，对该村工作有很大帮助。在大油村复员军人戴照只，初回乡时，没有得到适当安置与处理，未与村中工作和群众很好结合，个人游离街头卖纸烟，村中工作也没有帮助；以后他参加了群众运动，担任民兵队长，领导群众武装，村里工作得到帮助，他也觉得和群众一起有了依靠。我建议政府军队在发给复员军人返乡证明文件中，最好介绍本人工作经历、特长，以便适当处理，复员军人也应发挥人民军队的优良传统，为群众服务，这样对村中工作和当前群运确是一很大的助力。
