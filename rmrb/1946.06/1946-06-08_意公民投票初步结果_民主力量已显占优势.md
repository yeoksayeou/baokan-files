Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: Rome dispatch: The Italian referendum concluded on the morning of the 3rd. The vote counting is extremely tense, but preliminary results indicate that democratic forces have surpassed reactionary forces (the coalition of monarchists, the right wing, and the Vatican) and taken a dominant position. On the issue of the political system, as of 11:00 AM on the 4th, the number of votes for the republic was roughly double the number of votes for the monarchy. Nenni, the leader of the Italian Socialist Party, announced based on a tally of one-tenth of the votes that 1,508,631 votes were in favor of the republic, while 847,561 votes were in favor of retaining the monarchy. According to reports, based on this one-tenth sample of votes, the industrial area of Northern Italy showed three times as many votes in favor of the republic as in favor of the monarchy; only in Southern Italy were votes in favor of the monarchy more numerous than those in favor of the republic. In the election for the Constituent Assembly, according to the statistics of one-fifth of the votes counted by the morning of the 4th, the Christian Democratic Party received 2,050,000 votes, the Socialist Party 1,365,000 votes, the Communist Party 1,229,000 votes, and other parties, including the monarchists, the pro-British extreme right-wing Liberal Party, and the pro-American centrist Action Party, totaled only 60,000 votes according to the statistics at 9:00 PM on the 3rd. These statistics indicate that the votes for the left-wing Communist and Socialist Parties exceeded the total votes for all other parties. It is estimated that 90 percent of Italy's 28 million voters participated in the voting.
