Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th. The Kuomintang government convened a financial revenue and expenditure system meeting in Nanjing on the 6th. Yu Hongjun's "address" emphasized the need to continue implementing the land tax collection in kind and openly condoned the abusive policies of local harsh levies and miscellaneous taxes. A resolution was passed according to this opinion on the 9th. Yu himself confessed that since June of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), when the provincial financial system was merged into the central government system and the land tax was changed to collection in kind, the result was that the original local land tax, business tax, and deed tax were seized by the central government of the Party (already a major source of central revenue). On the other hand, the Kuomintang local governments implemented harsh levies and miscellaneous taxes "outside the regulations," resulting in heavy and numerous levies, with no day without levies and no item exempt from levies, causing great distress to the economy and people's livelihoods. However, the new method decided by the Kuomintang authorities this time is to divide the financial revenue and expenditure system into central and provincial/county levels, so that the central government still plunders 30% of the land tax (40% for municipalities under the Executive Yuan) and a large portion of the business tax and inheritance tax. Yu Hongjun allowed local governments to implement harsh levies and miscellaneous taxes as a portion of the financial resources thrown to the local governments. He said that counties and cities can levy special taxes as long as they are approved by the puppet "public opinion organs." Yu Hongjun particularly emphasized the need to "continue to promote" the land tax collection in kind to "raise military rice," saying: "How to implement the collection in kind is the theme of this meeting." Furthermore, the Minister of Food, Xu Kan, also stated in response to inquiries in the Legislative Yuan on the 6th that the Kuomintang government had decided to continue implementing the land tax collection in kind and admitted that "requisitioning and purchasing disturbs the people" after the victory. Thus, the Kuomintang authorities' so-called grand order to suspend the collection in kind for one year last September has now been openly torn up.

    国民党政府财政无出路
    公开主张勒索农民
    撕毁停止田赋征实命令
    【新华社延安十日电】六日国民党政府在南京召开财政收支系统会议，俞鸿钧的“致词”，强调要继续实行田赋征实，并公开容许地方苛杂摊派的虐政，并已于九日照此意见通过决议。俞氏自供称：民国三十年六月实行省级财政归并中央政府系统，及田赋改征实物，其结果一方面原地方之田赋、营业税、契税被该党中央政府夺去（已为中央收入之大宗），另方面国民党地方政府就在“法令规定以外”，实行苛杂摊派，以致苛杂繁重，摊派百出，无一天不在摊派之中，无一物不在摊派之列，经济民生，多受其困。但是此次国民党当局决定的新办法，为将财政收支系统分为中央、省县二级，使其中央政府仍掠夺了田赋三成（院辖市为四成）及营业税、遗产税的很大一部分，俞鸿钧就容许地方实行苛杂摊派做为掷与地方的一部分财物。他说县市只要经御用的“民意机关”同意，就开征特种税捐。俞鸿钧特别强调要“继续推行”田赋征实“筹供军米”谓：“征实如何实施，乃此次会议之主题”，又粮食部长徐堪于六日在立法院答复质询时，亦谓国民党政府已决定继续实行田赋征实，并供出胜利以后“征购扰民”。如是去年九月国民党当局所谓停止征实一年的堂皇命令，现已公开撕毁。
