    Yuanqu Exposes Landlord's "Change of Heaven" Conspiracy
    Rent Reduction and Debt Clearance Deepened
    Zanhuang Combines Wheat Harvest with Mass Movement Effectively
    [Our Newspaper Yangcheng News] In villages around Kouli (mountainous area) and Kouwai (plain area) in Yuanqu County, the masses had carried out rent reduction and debt clearance struggles at the end of last year and in February this year. However, due to insufficient leadership, the movement failed to deepen. Taking advantage of this, the local bullies and landlords actively resisted the peasants' struggle in a planned way. Ma Rui, a reactionary landlord in Dashiya Village, spread "change of heaven" rumors everywhere to landlords, encouraging them to "never return documents and contracts (which should be returned according to law)," and "to keep an account of everything that is returned, in preparation for future reversals." In the struggle, when peasants legally demanded the return of documents, the landlords cunningly claimed that they were "lost" or "burned during the Japanese occupation." The leadership did not pay attention to this, and the movement came to a standstill. However, the masses still demanded a thorough resolution. In late April, the masses of Dashiya launched a second struggle against landlord Di Shijie, resolutely demanding the return of documents. Faced with conclusive evidence, Di could not deny it and finally returned the documents, admitting that the reason he did not bring them out the first time was because Ma Rui told him not to. He even confessed to the "change of heaven" propaganda that Ma Rui had carried out against him. Afterward, the masses held another meeting to struggle against Ma Rui and three other landlords to "demand documents," resulting in the retrieval of more than two hundred documents. This struggle quickly spread to Nanbu, Jinfu, Shangdengban and other villages, where the masses exposed the landlords' conspiracy, launched another struggle, and retrieved their documents, settling past issues. The development of this struggle has deepened the rent reduction and debt clearance movement in Yuanqu, and the awareness and vigilance of cadres and the masses have been further improved. The masses of Nanbu said, "The hearts of the landlords are vicious."
    [Our Newspaper Xingtai News] In Zanhuang, where the rent reduction movement is reaching a climax, in order to prevent the movement from being completely interrupted during the wheat harvest, the eighteen compiled villages in the seventh district of the county have made specific and appropriate arrangements in three categories. The first category of villages is to summarize the movement, seize the opportunity to organize, carry out a shock wheat harvest, and solve the outstanding problems in the mass movement during the wheat harvest. The second category of villages is to work with the masses to harvest while deliberating, preparing to enter into action immediately after the wheat harvest. The third category of villages is to immediately organize several central struggle meetings to quickly resolve the issue of rent and tenancy, so that the masses can pay rent according to the new agreement after the wheat harvest, and quickly distribute the fruits of the struggle. In addition, Yehe Village in the sixth district of Wu'an is also rapidly resolving the issue of rent payment in conjunction with the wheat harvest. The Taihang Xinhua Daily published a short essay calling for learning from the appropriate arrangements for rent reduction in the seventh district of Zanhuang during the wheat harvest and the grasping of the resolution of rent payment issues in Yehe Village.

    垣曲揭破地主“变天”阴谋
    减租清债深入一步
    赞皇麦收群运结合得好
    【本报阳城讯】垣曲县口里（山地）、口外（平原）一带村庄，去年底与今年二月，群众都曾进行减租清债斗争。但由于领导上放手不够。使运动未能深入。恶霸地主们就乘隙活动有计划的抵抗农民斗争。大石崖村反动地主马瑞，到处向地主宣传“变天”谣言，鼓动地主们“千万不要退出文书契约（依法应退的），”“要把退出去的一切都记个账，准备将来翻案。”在斗争中农民依法索还文契时，地主狡赖都推说“失落了”，“日本来时烧了”等。领导上未加注意，运动乃告停顿。可是群众仍要求彻底解决。在四月底，大石崖群众二次斗争地主狄士杰，坚决索还文契。狄在确凿证据面前，无法抵赖，终将文契退出，并承认第一次所以不拿出来，是马瑞不叫他拿；连马瑞对他进行的变天宣传，也都坦白了，以后，群众又集会向马瑞等四个地主进行“要文契”斗争，结果要出二百多张。这一斗争很快波及南堡、近扶、上灯坂等村，群众揭破地主阴谋，再次展开斗争，纷纷要回了文契。了结过去问题。这一斗争的开展，使垣曲的减租清债运动深入了一步，干部与群众的觉悟与警惕性均更提高。南堡群众说：“地主的心就是凶狠。”
    【本报邢台讯】减租运动正在走上高潮的赞皇，为使麦收中运动不致完全中断，该县七区十八个编村，特分三类作了具体适当的安排，第一类村，是总结运动，趁热组织起来，突击麦收，在麦收中解决群运中遗留问题，第二类村，是和群众共同在麦收中一面收割，一面酝酿，准备麦收一过，立即进入行动。第三类村，是马上组织几个中心的大斗争会，使租佃问题迅速得到初步解决，使群众在麦收后能依新约交租，并迅速分配斗争果实。又，武安六区野河村，亦正在结合麦收，迅速解决交租问题。太行新华日报著短论号召学习赞皇七区在麦收中适当安排减租与野河村抓紧解决交租问题。
