Xinhua News Agency, Jilin-Liaoning Front, 3rd: A regiment of the Kuomintang army's American-equipped New Army was completely wiped out after being routed in Heishizhen, more than 40 li northeast of Hailong, which it had invaded. Since this army was transferred from Benxi to the right flank of Sipingjie to expand the civil war, it has continued to advance despite the great concessions made by the Democratic Allied Army to strive for peace. On May 30th, the 181st Regiment (formerly the 1st Battalion of the 619th Regiment) of the 267th Division of this army, with more than 600 men, occupied Heishizhen, southwest of our Huadian County. A unit of the Democratic Allied Army in southern Manchuria, in order to prevent the Kuomintang army from expanding the civil war, engaged in a fierce battle with the regiment on the night of the 31st, lasting all night, killing and wounding more than 100 of them. At dawn, a part of the regiment, using five vehicles and a part on foot, broke through towards Chaoyang Town (northeast of Hailong). When they reached near Lao Lie La Zi, they were completely annihilated. The Democratic Allied Army in southern Manchuria captured more than 300 of them below the regimental commander, killed and wounded more than 200, and seized two 82mm mortars, eight American-style heavy machine guns, more than 20 light machine guns, more than 20 submachine guns, and a part of ammunition and military supplies. Now, the Democratic Allied Army, with high morale, will resolutely block the Kuomintang army's continued advance.

Xinhua News Agency, Mudanjiang, 3rd: After three months of efforts, the Mudanjiang People's Self-Defense Army has cleared out all the bandits in the entire territory, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 5,000 bandits and seizing a large number of guns. From then on, the vast area of northeastern Manchuria has been completely connected, transportation is smooth, and the people live and work in peace. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, the bandit armed forces entrenched in the Mudanjiang area, organized by national traitors in collusion with the remnants of Japanese fascists, included the bandit gangs of Xie Wendong, Li Huatang, Gao Yong'an, Zhang Dezhen, Li Kaijiang, Ma Xishan, and Guo Yunfeng. In the areas occupied by the bandits, the people were plunged into starvation and desperation, just as the local masses said to the People's Self-Defense Army: "If you had come one day later, we would have been finished." In order to relieve the people from their suffering, the Northeast Manchurian People's Self-Defense Army began to suppress the bandits in March. On the evening of March 15th, it began to suppress the Guo Yunfeng and Ma Xishan bandit gangs, with more than 2,000 people (including the Li Maomin bandit gang of Tianqiaoling with more than 500 people and the Wang De bandit gang of Nanhutou with more than 500 people), entrenched in the areas of Ludao, Chunyang, Jingbo Lake, and Tianqiaoling. After 15 days of suppression, in 11 battles, large and small, all the remaining bandits were wiped out except for dozens of remnants of Ma Xishan who fled. 27 light and heavy machine guns and more than 2,000 long and short guns were seized. On March 16th, the local People's Self-Defense Army concentrated a strong force to suppress the Gao Yong'an, Zhang Dezhen, and Li Kaijiang gangs, with more than 2,000 people, entrenched in the Yulin River, Mutai Zi, and Maqiao River areas. After several days of fierce fighting, their last stronghold was removed. Li Kaijiang and Zhang Dezhen led their troops to surrender completely (only bandit leader Gao Yong'an escaped), and more than 1,000 long and short guns were seized. The Jiamusi Self-Defense Army, after starting the bandit suppression in October, first moved westward with elite troops to clear the bandits along the Jiamusi to Harbin line, liberating cities such as Yilan, and then moved southward with a strong force to attack the old nests of bandits such as Xie Wendong and Li Huapei. In the Battle of Victory City, their "General Headquarters" was annihilated, and more than 1,000 people below the chief of staff were captured. The so-called "Commander-in-Chief" escaped with his life.
