Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: The New York Herald Tribune reports on the competition between British and American capital in Greece, stating that the U.S. State Department has instructed the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Greece to strongly oppose British attempts to monopolize the Greek economy. It is said that Britain has concluded a monopoly agreement with Greece, stipulating the establishment of a management system with one British and one Greek chairman. This monopoly system will determine what should be produced, what should be imported and exported, what kind of goods, and where they should be shipped. The report points out that the United States is also sparing no effort to woo Greece. For example, the U.S. Export-Import Bank lent Greece $25 million in January. Currently, Greece needs another $200 million in loans from the United States, and the United States is selecting experts to go to Greece as advisors for Greek economic construction. However, the report says that the British trade mission, which has been in Greece for more than six months, has already established a good foothold there.

    英美资本逐鹿希腊
    英国要垄断美国亟图染指
    【新华社延安九日电】纽约讯：纽约先驱论坛报报导英美资本在希腊角逐的消息说：美国务院已指令美国驻希代办，强烈反对英垄断希腊经济的企图。据说：英国已与希腊成立一垄断协定，规定成立以英、希各一人为董事长的管理制度，这一垄断制度，将规定何者应生产，何者应进口出口及为何种商品，及运往何处等。该报指出：美国对希腊的拉拢亦不遗余力，例如美进出口银行曾于一月间贷与希腊二千五百万美元，目前希腊还需要美国二万万元贷款，美国正在选派专家赴希腊，当希腊经济建设的顾问。但该报说，在希腊逗留六个月以上的英贸易使团，已在该地据有良好之阵地。
