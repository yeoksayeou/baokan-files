Xinhua News Agency, Yantai, 25th: Ruifeng Flour Company, a well-known national industry in Yantai City, officially resumed operations this month. The company was founded in May of the 11th year of the Republic of China (1922), with a capital of 297,000 yuan. It was entirely machine-operated, producing over 44,000 catties of flour daily. The flour was sold extensively in various ports along the coast. After Yantai fell, it was forced to close down. On April 1, 1942, the enemy forcibly took over the factory and renamed it "Dongya Flour Milling Company." After liberation, the democratic government conducted a detailed investigation and returned all non-enemy assets within the company to the original owners, assisting them in purchasing 1.8 million catties of wheat and 500,000 tons of coal to facilitate its rapid resumption of operations.

    瑞丰面粉公司复业
    除敌产部分外全归原主
    【新华社烟台廿五日电】烟台市著名的民族工业——瑞丰面粉公司，于月内正式复工营业。该公司创办于民国十一年五月，当时拥有资金廿九万七千元，全部为机器生产，每日可产面粉四万四千余斤，所产面粉遍售沿海附近各港口。烟台沦陷后，被迫停业，民国卅一年四月一日，敌人又将该厂强行使用，改名为“东亚制粉公司”。解放后经民主政府详细调查，将该公司内非敌产部分，全部归还原主，协助其购买小麦一百八十万斤，煤炭五十万吨，使其迅速复业。
