    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Paris dispatch: The French Constituent Assembly opened at noon on the 13th. Jia Sheng (age 75), the oldest representative, assumed the chairmanship according to the traditional custom of the French Parliament. The main item of the first meeting was Jia's opening speech. After reviewing the economic and social difficulties facing France and the world after the war, he urged the Constituent Assembly to quickly formulate a new constitution. Furthermore, French interim government President Gouin sent a letter on the 11th to Jia Sheng, the interim speaker of the new Constituent Assembly, submitting his government's resignation. The letter stated that the government would continue to perform its duties until a new government is formed.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Paris dispatch: The French newspaper "Le Monde" believes that the financial agreement concluded by Blum in the United States during the election period was a pre-election ploy that seriously damaged the interests of France. "Nouvelles Économiques" points out that the modern French postal ship "Normandie" was valued at 825 million francs in 1935, and American experts stipulated that the amount to be paid to France based on the valuation should be 60 million US dollars. However, according to Blum's agreement, the current valuation is only 17 million US dollars, equivalent to 290 million francs. "Nouvelles Économiques" claims that the agreement allows France to purchase the American military surplus remaining in French territory. The American side estimates the value of these materials at 300 million US dollars, while French experts estimate the remaining materials and useful equipment to be worth a total of 50 million US dollars. French economic newspapers have expressed dissatisfaction with Blum's actions, which sacrifice French interests for the sake of partisan gain.

    贾生就任法议会主席
    古恩政府提出辞呈
    【新华社延安十三日电】巴黎讯：法立宪议会十三日午后开幕，年龄最高的代表贾生（七十五岁），按照法议会传统习惯充任主席。第一次会议主要事项，为贾氏的开幕演说。他对战后法国及世界的经济社会困难，作一检讨后，吁请立宪议会迅速制定新宪。又法临时政府总统古恩，十一日致函新立宪议会临时议长贾生，提出其政府的辞呈，该函言明政府将继续执行职务，直至新政府成立为止。
    【新华社延安十二日电】巴黎讯：法国世界日报认为在竞选时期，勃鲁姆在美缔结的财政协定，乃是选举前的计谋，此种计谋，严重的损害了法国的利益。诺维尔经济周报指出：最近代的法国邮船“诺曼第”号，在一九三五年被估价为八亿二千五百万法郎，美国专家规定按估价应付法款额为六千万美元。但根据勃鲁姆的协定，现在的估价，则仅为一千七百万元，合两千九百万法郎。诺维尔经济周报称：该协定使法国购买留于法境的美军剩余物资，美方估计此等物资之价值为三亿元，而法国专家的估计剩余物资及有用装备等，共值五千万元。法国各经济报纸，对勃鲁姆此种为一党私利，而牺牲法国利益之举，纷表不满。
