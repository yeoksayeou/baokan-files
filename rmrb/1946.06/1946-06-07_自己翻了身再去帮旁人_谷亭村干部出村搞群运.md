After Emancipating Themselves, They Help Others
Village Cadres from Guting Village Go Out to Conduct Mass Mobilization
[Report from our Heze office] Sixteen village cadres from Guting Township, Yutai County, enthusiastically signed up to join work teams and lead the mass movement. They had all suffered from hardship and oppression in the past, and now that they have been emancipated themselves, they feel they should help others to be emancipated. Comrade Yang Youde, the chairman of the peasant association, has only an eighty-year-old mother at home. When he was about to leave, his mother didn't want him to go. He said to his mother sadly, "This time I go out to help the poor to be emancipated! Mother, think about it, before the Eighth Route Army came, when I sold tea on the street, did anyone ever call me by my real name? It was always 'Second Dog' this and 'Second Dog' that. If I answered slowly, I would be scolded. When we saw people, we had to greet them from afar, 'Have you eaten? Want some tea?' They ignored us and walked away with their heads held high. How difficult life was for the poor at that time! Since the Eighth Route Army came, we poor people have been emancipated and no longer go hungry! Everyone elected me as the chairman of the peasant association, and the landlords no longer call me 'Second Dog'! Now that we have stood up, there are still other poor people being oppressed. I am going out to help them stand up like us!" After hearing these words, his mother, although old, unhesitatingly told her son to go.

    自己翻了身再去帮旁人
    谷亭村干部出村搞群运
    【本报荷泽讯】鱼台县谷亭镇十六名村干部，踊跃报名参加工作组，去领导群运。他们过去都受过痛苦和压迫，现在自己翻了身，觉得应当去帮助别人翻身。农会主任杨友德同志，家里只有一个八十岁的老母，他要离家时，老母不让他出来，他很悲痛的对老母说：“这次我出去，是帮助穷人翻身！娘你想想，八路军没来时，我在街上卖茶，那一个人喊过我的大号？都是‘二狗’长‘二狗’短的。答应得慢了，还得挨骂。见了人，离很远咱就得招呼人家‘吃饭没有？喝茶不？’人家不理咱，仰着头走人家的。那时穷人的日子是多么难过呀！自从八路军来了，咱穷人才翻了身，也不挨饿了！大家选我当了农会主任，地主再没有喊我‘二狗’的了！现在咱翻起身来了，还有别的穷人受压迫，我出去就是帮助他们和咱一样翻起身来！”母亲听了这一番话，虽然年老，但毫不迟疑的叫他儿子去了。
