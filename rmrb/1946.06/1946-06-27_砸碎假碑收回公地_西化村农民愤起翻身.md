　　Smashing False Steles to Reclaim Public Land
    Xihua Village Peasants Rise Up to Overthrow Oppression
    [Our Newspaper Yangcheng News] In Xihua, a key village in the Second District of Meng County, the villagers united and recovered the village's public land that had been occupied by the local tyrant landlord Liu Deyi for 208 years, and smashed the false stone stele in the Liu Family Ancestral Hall that had been used to control the peasants. The village had over 200 mu of public land in the Yellow River滩 (Tan), which the villagers had fought for and won in the third year of the Qianlong Emperor's reign after twelve people died fighting on the south bank of the Yellow River, exploited by landlords. Later, it was forcibly occupied by the Liu surname "Clan Association" manipulated by the local tyrant landlord Liu Deyi. Liu Deyi also erected a false stele in the Liu Family Ancestral Hall, claiming that this piece of public land was "personal share land" granted to the Liu family by the Magistrate of Meng County, with records in the county annals, etc. However, the poor and small households among the Liu clan did not have a "share"; if they wanted to cultivate a few mu, they had to give Liu Deyi "black money." In the first year of the Republic of China, the villagers had fought several lawsuits with Liu Deyi, which were never resolved, and the leader, Gao Guangxiu, was beaten to death. After we liberated Meng County, Liu Deyi, fearing that his crimes would be exposed, immediately convened a Liu clan meeting, mobilizing everyone to speak in the ancestral hall: "One's arms cannot bend outwards," to confuse the masses; he also used his son Liu Xianglu's position as an instructor in Zhang Bohua's Kuomintang army across the river to intimidate the villagers, and the masses dared to be angry but did not dare to speak. During the mass mobilization this year, more than 120 hired laborers in the village had their wages increased, but the masses were not enthusiastic. The leadership also listened to some of the issues, but because the work was not thorough enough, they thought it was a clan dispute between other surnames and the Liu surname and did not pay much attention. Later, after further investigation, they heard the general public gossiping in private: "Liu Deyi has occupied two or three qing of public land, and the common people don't have enough land to cultivate, and they dare not vent their anger, how can they overthrow oppression?" The leading comrades then suddenly realized this, expressed their firm support to the masses, and many people became excited. Some said they wanted to do it, but they were afraid of retaliation, and some advanced elements suggested: "As long as everyone is armed, we won't be afraid." So they organized a militia and formed a "Overthrow Oppression Association," and everyone went separately to mobilize the villagers to speak out about their suffering and grievances. At this time, it was discovered that many small and poor households in the Liu clan were also oppressed by Liu Deyi: Liu Qiqin's family had their property seized by Liu Deyi and were so poor that they didn't know where their next meal was coming from; Liu Mingde only had one mu of land, which was also forcibly occupied by Liu Deyi. When he "reasoned" with them, he was beaten up and taken to the ancestral hall where he had to treat everyone before it was over. Everyone immediately went separately to unite and mobilize these suffering people of the Liu surname, to speak out about their suffering and grievances, and to launch a struggle against Liu Deyi. Under the pressure of the masses, Liu admitted all his past crimes of forcibly occupying public land, dividing the peasants' struggle, and deceiving the staff. The masses immediately recovered the public land on the spot, smashed the false stone stele he had made, and excitedly shouted "Overthrow Oppression!" The 87-member river defense self-defense team was quickly organized, and the militia patrolled back and forth along the riverbank outpost every night, encouraging and warning each other: "We must not let a single spy or scout go! We must not let Zhang Bohua and Liu Xianglu's troops cross the Yellow River!" On May 30, they indeed captured a spy sent by Zhang Bohua on the riverbank.

　　砸碎假碑收回公地
    西化村农民愤起翻身
    【本报阳城讯】孟县二区西化基点村，在全村农民团结下，退回了被恶霸地主刘德义，占去二百零八年的村公地，砸碎了刘家祠堂统治农民的假石碑。该村在黄河滩有村公地二百多亩，是该村农民于乾隆三年受地主利用，到黄河南岸打架，死了十二个人争夺回来的。后来被该村恶霸地主刘德义所操纵的刘姓“宗祖会”强占。刘德义并在刘家祠堂内立假碑，说这片公地是孟县知事判给姓刘的“人份地”，县志上有记载等，但刘姓中的小户穷户，都没有“份”；想种几亩，还得给刘德义送“黑钱”。民国元年，该村农民曾与刘德义打过几场官司，迄未解决，为首的农民高广秀反被毒打而死。我解放孟县后，刘德义怕自己罪行暴露，当即召集刘姓大会，动员大家有话在祠堂说：“胳膊不能往外屈”，来迷惑群众；又以其子刘祥麓在对岸国民党军张伯华部当指导员来威吓全村群众，群众敢怒不敢言。在今年发动群众时，该村也曾有一百二十多个雇工增资，可是，群众总不起劲，领导上对于这个问题也到听些，因工作不够深入，以为是他姓与刘姓宗派之争，没大注意。以后又作调查，才听到一般群众都在背地舆论：“刘德义霸占了两三顷公地，老百姓地不够种，气不敢出，怎能翻身？”领导同志这时恍然大悟，向群众表示坚决撑腰，许多群众激动起来。有人说要干，就是怕人家报复，有的先进群众提出：“只要大家武装起来就不怕。”于是组织了民兵，成立了一个“翻身会”，大家分头去发动全村群众诉苦申冤。这时发现刘姓中有许多小户穷户同样受刘德义的压迫：刘吉钦家被刘德义霸占了财产，穷的吃了上顿没下顿；刘明德只有一亩地，也被刘德义强占了。他和人家“理论”，反挨一顿毒打，被押到祠堂里请了客才完事。大家即分头去团结与发动这些刘姓的苦人，诉苦伸冤，向刘德义展开斗争，群众压力下，刘承认自己过去强占公地，以及分化农民斗争，欺哄工作人员等全部罪恶，群众当场把公地收回，把他自造的假志石碑也砸碎了，兴奋的呼叫着“翻身了！”八十七人的河防自卫队很快组织起来，民兵每夜来往巡查于河岸前哨阵地，互相鼓舞告戒：“决不能放过一个特务、侦探！决不叫张伯华、刘祥麓的队伍过黄河来！”五月三十日果然在河岸上捕获张伯华派来的特务一名。
