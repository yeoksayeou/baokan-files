Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 4th. Eleven senior elementary schools and eighty-six junior elementary schools in the liberated areas of Xugou, Qingyuan, and Taiyuan counties, which had been restored with the assistance of the democratic government, have been severely damaged and completely shut down due to the large-scale invasion by the Yan-Japanese puppet allied forces in mid-May. The Xigu Elementary School in Qingyuan was shelled by Yan's army, and all the remaining items were looted. The Nan'yi Elementary School in Xugou, with a long history, had all its instruments and school equipment destroyed. The 181 teachers and 5,900 students in the aforementioned three counties have been forced to become displaced. The democratic government is doing its best to shelter and provide relief to them, and has established a temporary elementary school in Qing, Tai, and Xu to provide temporary assistance. The school has now opened.
