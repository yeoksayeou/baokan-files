    UNRRA Relief Supplies Distribution Extremely Unfair
    Liberated Areas Receive Less Than One Percent
    Border Region Relief Association Decides to Strengthen County-Level Organizations
    [Report from this newspaper] The Border Region Relief Association welcomed Zhao Bingqian on the 3rd, who had just returned from Beiping. He reported on the discussions with UNRRA and CNRRA representatives in Beiping, along with representative Zhang Baiyuan. Regarding the extremely unfair distribution of United Nations relief supplies, he stated: According to the CNRRA's seven major work plans, there are approximately 42 million refugees nationwide, with 26 million in the liberated areas urgently requiring relief, accounting for 60% of the total number of refugees in the country. According to the CNRRA's report at the Kuomintang Fourth Plenary Session, the UNRRA had shipped 250,000 tons of supplies to China as of February 20th (supplies shipped in March, April, and May are not included). As of the end of May, the Shandong liberated area had only received 1,400 tons, the Jin-Cha-Ji area 180 tons, and our region only 4,000 bags of black flour. In total, this accounts for 0.15% of the United Nations' shipments to China. Regarding the work of the CNRRA work teams, he stated: The work teams around our border region are all working in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, not only completely relieving the Kuomintang-controlled areas, but even the puppet army-controlled areas within Yongnian city have been relieved. As for the relief supplies that the fourth work team stationed in Cangxian County was supposed to allocate to four counties in the Jinan liberated area, our representative requested that the team distribute the supplies before the wheat harvest, and completed the travel procedures with the CNRRA representatives at the Beiping Executive Headquarters. Our representative also sent a special letter of introduction; however, there has been no news to date. Our representative was deeply surprised by this peculiar phenomenon! (Fang De)
    [Another Report] The Border Region Relief Association held a plenary meeting on the 3rd, attended by thirteen committee members. Based on the instructions from the Liberated Areas Relief Association conveyed by Zhao Bingqian, the meeting reviewed why past work had not been done better, citing the unsoundness of the county association organizations as the reason. It was decided that each county should have one to three people dedicated to county association work, with association cadres not holding any other positions. Secondly, it was decided to emphasize the importance of this work to the county leadership. Furthermore, the following decisions were made: 1. The administrative system for relief work in the Shandong portion of the Border Region will remain under the Border Region Branch, while the work will be assigned to the Shandong Provincial Branch. 2. Strengthen the collection and organization of information on the development and changes in disaster situations, and send it to the representatives stationed in Beiping in a timely manner. 3. Strengthen external reporting to draw the attention of righteous people in society to this work. 4. Step up social welfare work.

    联总救济物资分配太不公
    解放区所得不及百分之一
    边区救济分会决定健全各县机构
    【本报讯】边区救济分会于三日欢迎顷从北平归来之代表赵秉谦，彼即席报告与代表张柏园在平向联总、行总会谈经过。谈到联合国救济物资分配极不公平的事实称：据行总七大工作计划所载全国难民约有四千二百万人，而解放区急待救济的则有二千六百万，占全国难民总数百分之六十，根据行总在国民党四中全会上的报告，联总运抵中国之物资截至二月二十日为止，已达二十五万吨（三、四、五月运华物资尚不在内），截至五月底止，山东解放区仅获得一千四百吨，晋察冀一百八十吨，本区只得到黑面四千袋。综计占联合国运华物资百分之零点一五。谈到行总工作队的工作时称：在本边区周围之工作队全在国民党统治区工作，不但将国民党统治区已完全救济，甚至永年城内伪军统治区也救济了，而驻沧县第四工作队应分配给冀南解放区四个县的救济物资，经我方代表提出希该队应在麦收前拨发，且与行联代表至北平执行部办妥通行手续，我方代表复专函介绍；但至今杳无音讯。我代表对此种奇特现象深感惊异！（方德）
    【又讯】边区救济分会于三日召开全体会议，计到委员十三人，根据赵秉谦氏传达的解放区救济总会指示，检讨过去工作所以没有做得更好，在于各县协会机构不健全等原因，决定每县由一至三人专作县协会工作，协会干部不兼其他任何职务，其次当提起各县领导方面对此工作之重视，复决定：一、在边区之山东部分救济工作行政系统，仍属边区分会，工作则划归山东省分会。二、加强灾情发展变化材料之搜集与整理，及时送驻平代表。三、加强对外报导，引起社会正义人士对此工作之重视。四、加紧社会福利工作。
