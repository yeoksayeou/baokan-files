    Land Reform and Democracy
    By Varga
    Translated by Jiao Minzhi

    After World War II, in the People's Democratic countries of Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and others, land reform was realized under completely different conditions. First, in these countries, for the first time in their history, a national regime capable of protecting the interests of the people was established. After World War I, even in those countries that had declared some form of democracy and universal suffrage, it was still a state of landlords and bankers. But this is not the case now. The newly established democratic governments in these countries were established by the people and received assistance from broad sections of the people, such as peasants, workers, intellectuals, craftsmen, merchants, and industrialists. This decisive advancement in democracy has left its mark on land reform.

    Current land reform is all-encompassing and comprehensive. Its characteristics are as follows:

    As a rule, the land belonging to large landowners—landlords—is handed over to laboring peasants. In the past, the so-called confiscation of land only confiscated a small amount of land from the landlords.

    The current land reform is a reform implemented entirely for the benefit of all peasants. Therefore, there is a clear difference in attitude towards landlords' land and peasants' land. Peasants' land, even if it exceeds the limits that the peasant and his family can cultivate, is still left to the peasant, but if the landlord also has so much land, it will be confiscated.

    When implementing land reform, attention should be paid to the position of those involved in land reform. The land of landlords who are accused of selling out their country, cooperating with the Hitler occupation forces, and harming their own people is confiscated without compensation. As for landlords who participated in the liberation struggle against the occupation forces and have made considerable contributions, they can still retain a portion of their land (for example, in Hungary, they can retain up to 300 Hungarian acres). When distributing land, agricultural workers and small farmers who have made outstanding contributions in the war of liberation against the German fascist invaders enjoy special privileges.

    Land reform is aimed at the interests of the peasants, not at the interests of the landlords as it was after World War I. Therefore, the amount of compensation received by the landlords is not determined by the deliberately inflated land prices monopolized by the large landowners, but by the amount that the laboring peasants, the new masters, can afford. This means that the peasants who receive land in the land reform use these lands under the most favorable conditions. The amount they pay to the landlords is immeasurably less than after World War I. Because after World War I, the compensation paid by the state to the landlords was not only very high, but it was entirely borne by the peasants who acquired the land.

    Now, the peasants not only pay the state a very small land price, but this payment is not made all at once after receiving the land, but after a considerable period, that is, after they have managed the land very well.

    The democratic governments of the above-mentioned countries have also adopted a completely new policy in guaranteeing the means of production for the peasants. This issue is no longer a problem for each peasant to solve on his own. This is one of the tasks of the state. Many means of production, such as livestock and machines, were slaughtered and destroyed during the war and the German occupation. Secondly, some machines cannot be used on small fields. The state is very concerned about the equipment of agricultural machinery, tools, and other means of production used by the peasants. The state pays great attention to ensuring that existing means of production can be well utilized. It also encourages peasants to unite into collective organizations in order to jointly sell their products and jointly purchase manufactured goods from urban industries, in order to eliminate speculative merchants who take advantage of restrictions to make profits.

    Another matter that the state pays attention to is ensuring that peasants can obtain low-interest loans after obtaining new land. At the same time, this method is used to protect peasants from the danger of being exploited by usurers with exorbitant interest rates. In short, the state has done everything that can help peasants prosper economically: not only by using the distribution of land, but also by using all other facilities of the state to protect the interests of the people.

    The implementation of land reform has fundamentally changed the entire face of many countries in Eastern Europe. The living conditions of the peasants have also undergone fundamental changes. For example, in Hungary, before the reform, 184 landlords had 962,000 Hungarian acres of land, 869 landlords had 1,360,000 Hungarian acres, and 3,876 landlords had 1,530,000 Hungarian acres. But now, there are only thirteen large farms with land up to 300 Hungarian acres. These lands are reserved for those who have made outstanding contributions in the struggle against German fascists and their Hungarian traitors. In Hungary, about four million Hungarian acres of landlords' land were confiscated and purchased with money. Among the 661,000 poor people, 177,790 agricultural workers, 57,127 tenant farmers, 33,280 farmers with very little land, 22,934 small landowners, and 15,165 rural craftsmen have now been allocated land. Each new landlord receives an average of 4.5-5.5 Hungarian acres of land, enough to support a family of four to five people. As a result, Hungary's land reform has eliminated inequality in the Hungarian countryside. The land of the past thousands of feudal landlords is now shared by hundreds of thousands of peasants.

    In Poland, 150,000 landless peasants and farm laborers are planting their own land for the first time this year instead of planting the land of their masters. In the past, more than 200,000 farmers with little land have increased their land. As a result of land reform, about two million people, including their families, have received land.

    The land reform issue in Germany is somewhat special. In the decision on the economic principles of Germany at the Berlin Conference of the Three Powers, it was said:

    "In order to eliminate excessive economic concentration, especially cartels, syndicates, trusts, and other monopolistic agreements, the German economy must be effectively decentralized in the shortest possible time."

    Can there be any doubt that Germany's large land ownership is a concentrated form of the greatest and strongest economic power in Germany, in addition to the monopolistic organization?

    The task set by the United Nations to completely eradicate fascism and Nazism also requires the elimination of the economic foundations of fascist violence. But among the economic foundations, the most important one is the land ownership of the Junkers. In the territories ceded to the Republic of Poland, the large estates of the German Junker families were eliminated. But in the territories left to Germany, large Junker land ownership is still a great and dangerous reactionary force. Therefore, only the elimination of this force can become a prerequisite for a future democratic Germany. In addition to the financial monopolists and oligarchs, the Junker landlords were also the true masters of Hitler's Germany. They have long been the provocateurs of predatory aggression and the bearers of misanthropic, narrow-minded patriotism conferences. The large estates of the landlords served as the pillar of German imperialism.

    Therefore, it is not surprising that now, the democratic anti-fascists in Germany have raised the issue of land reform that must be implemented. On the one hand, this reform must eliminate its most important economic foundation. On the other hand, it needs to satisfy the land desires of peasants and Germans who have moved into the country from neighboring countries. It is enough to recall one thing, for example, in the province of Brandenburg, one-third of all land suitable for cultivation is controlled by large landlords. In the Breslau region, of the 106,768 hectares of land suitable for cultivation, 71,308 hectares were held by large landlords. The landlords are engaging in sabotage. Under these circumstances, for example, 32 percent of all cultivated land is now deserted.

    In the new democratic Germany, the feudal land private ownership and the Junker class, which constitute the backbone of Prussian militarism, cannot be allowed to exist. The implementation of land reform in Germany is a necessary condition for the true and lasting democratization of the country. At the same time, the abolition of large land ownership by the Junker feudal lords in Germany can give a serious blow to the reactionary forces on the international stage.

    Naturally, large landowners are unwilling to eliminate their thousand-year-old rule. It is true that they are few in number among the people. They cannot fight alone to resist the democratic people's government. But they are not alone either. The reactionary forces of all countries are on his side. They have spread open and secret lackeys among all classes of people. These lackeys are hidden among the big urban capitalists, and the landlords use industrial and commercial and trust enterprises and their families to get in touch. There are also those who pursue industrial profits in state organs, some of these officials are from large landlords, and some are materially related to them. Finally, the landlords also find their lackeys among the upper echelons of the countryside.

    The struggle against land reform is carried out in various ways. Some agricultural "experts" complain that the dispersal of large estates will lead to the degradation of agriculture. The landlords' lackeys in the countryside threaten the poor peasants and agricultural workers who participate in land reform, saying that the landlords will retaliate against them in the future. The bureaucrats of the old administrative authorities try their best to delay the reform, hoping for a coup.

    Actions against land reform often take the form of a brutal political struggle. For example, the former Polish exiled "government" struggled against the Polish Provisional Government in order to protect the interests of large estates, used fascist agitation and despicable assassinations of Polish patriots, and provoked national chauvinistic motives.

    On the other hand, with the implementation of land reform, tens of thousands of peasants and agricultural workers are participating in political life for the first time. This means the awakening and organization of the broadest democrats in the countries formerly ruled by landlords. Tens of thousands of rural committees were established to help the democratic government implement land reform and eliminate reactionary forces. Comprehensive land reform, it itself completely eliminates! The assurance of the consolidation of the new democratic system in the countries of Eastern and Central Europe (but it has long been realized in other countries. And there is an open or unopen reaction of reactionary rule dependent on land private ownership of landlords), even those who still do not know the narrow superficial democracy in the past thousands of years of landlord rule lies here.

    At the same time, the realization of the dream of millions of peasants about land for many centuries clearly characterizes the progressiveness of the democratic system that has seized power in these liberated countries of Eastern Europe. This harvest of true democracy, such as the abolition of landlord land private rights and the division of land among the broad masses of peasants, is immeasurably heavier in the historical scales than the countless abstract sorrows about democracy in foreign newspapers. As for the "dictatorship" blamed on the people's democratic countries or liberated countries, this slander, in the near future, will at best be a fruit of blind amazement. But the realization of land reform will always be an important chapter in the history of European progress and European democracy.

    The land reform in several European countries is one of the most important gains of the freedom-loving people after smashing the fascist slave owners in the World War. It is the cornerstone of the establishment and consolidation of the people's democracy in these countries, and it is an important factor in guaranteeing the freedom of all peoples and the cause of peace among all peoples.

    土地改革与民主
    瓦尔加作
    焦敏之译
    在第二次世界大战之后，在实现了人民的民主国家的波兰，匈牙利，罗马尼亚，保加利亚，南斯拉夫等国，土地改革完全是在另一种条件下实现的。首先在这些国家之中，在他们的历史上破天荒地成立了能够保护人民利益的国家政权。在第一次世界大战之后，甚至在那些已经宣布了某种形式上的民主及普选权的国家之中，当时还仍然是地主银行家的国家。但现在则不然，在这些国家之中新成立的民主政府，则是由人民建立，并获得广大人民阶层方面的援助的，如农民、工人、知识分子、手工业者、商人及工业家的援助。在民主方面的这种决定推进，便把它的烙印烙在土地改革之上。
    现时的土地改革，是包容一切的，全面性的。其特点如下：
    照例地，凡是属于大土地所有者——地主——的土地，都交给劳动的农民，然而在过去，所谓没收土地，只是没收了地主的很少的土地。
    现在的土地改革，整个的是为了全体农民的利益而实行的一种改革。因此，对地主的土地与农民的土地，有截然不同的态度。农民的土地，纵然它已超过了农民及其家庭所能耕种的限度以外，仍然留给农民，但如地主，虽然它也是有这么多的土地，则予以没收。
    在实行土地改革之际，应注意土地改革的那些人们的立场。凡被控出卖祖国，与希特勒占领军合作而为害本国人民的地主，其土地均无报酬没收。至于参加过抵抗占领军的解放斗争并有相当功绩的地主，则其土地仍可有一部分留给他（比如在匈牙利，则留给他的土地可到三百匈亩）。在分配土地之际，那些在抵抗德国法西斯侵略者解放战争中勋功卓异的农业工人及小农，均享有特权。
    土地改革是着眼于农民的利益的，而不是像在第一次世界大战之后着眼于地主的利益。所以，地主所收到的赔偿的数目，并不是由大土地所有者居奇垄断而故意招高的地价而规定，而是以劳动农民即新的主人所能担负的数目来决定。这个就是说，在土地改革中分到土地的农民，是在最便宜的条件下去使用这些土地。他们对地主所付之款，比第一次世界大战之后少至不可限量。因为在第一次世界大战之后，国家付给地主的赔款，不仅非常之高，而且完全是压在取得土地的农民的肩膊上。
    现在，农民不只是付给国家很少的地价，而且这篡支付的款子，还不是在分到土地后就一下子付出，而且经过相当时期，即是说，在他们已经把土地经营的很有条理之后才付这笔债项。
    上述各国的民主政府，在保证农民以生产手段方面，也采取了一个崭新的政策。这个问题，现在，已不是推给每个农民个人自己去解决的问题了。这是国家的任务之一，许多生产手段如牲畜及机器等等，在战时及德国占领期间宰杀和毁坏了。其次有些机器，不是在小的田园上可采用的。国家对农民所使用的农业机器，农具，以及其他生产手段的装备很关心。国家很注意现有的生产手段能很好的加以利用。它同时也鼓励农民们联合到集体的组合中去，以便共同销售其生产品，共同购买都市工业的制成品，以便消灭用限制从中取巧的投机商人。
    国家注意的另一件事项，就是使农民在得到新的土地后，也能够得到低利息的贷款。同时，利用这种方式，保护农民不至受到高利贷者盘剥重利的危险。总之一句话，凡是可以帮助农民在经济上繁荣兴盛的事，国家都已作到了：不只是利用土地的分配，而且还利用国家所有的其它一切设施以保护人民的利益。
    土地改革的实行，东欧许多国家的整个面貌根本改变了。农民的生活状况也发生了根本的变化。举例来说，在匈牙利，在改革以前，一八四个地主有九六二、○○○匈亩土地，八六九个地主——一、三六○、○○○匈亩，三八七六个地主——一、五三○、○○○匈亩。但现在，土地到三○○匈亩的大的农庄只有十三个。这些土地是留给那些在反对德国法西斯蒂及其匈奸的斗争中卓著其勋绩的人们使用。在匈牙利全国，被没收及用款子购买的土地，约有四百万匈亩地主的土地。六十六万一千贫民之中，现在分到土地的有一七七、七九○个农业工人，五七、一二七个雇农，三三、二八○个土地很少的农民，二二、九三四个小土地所有者及一五、一六五个农村的手工业者。每一个新的田主平均得到四·五——五·五匈亩土地，足够维持一家四——五个人的生活。结果匈牙利的土地改革，使匈牙利农村不患不均了。过去的几千个封建大地主的土地，现在是由几十万农民共有了。
    在波兰，十五万户没有土地的农民及雇农，在本年已第一次不是种植主人的土地，而是自己的土地。在过去二十多万土地少的农民，增多了许多土地，结着土地改革，得到土地的人，连他们家眷算在内，共约有二百万人。
    德国的土地改革问题有些特别。在三强领袖柏林会议关于德国经济原则的决定中说：
    “为消灭经济上过分的集中，特别是加特尔、辛狄加、托辣斯以及其他独占协定起见，德国经济在最短期间就须实际上加以分散。”
    难道能怀疑德国的大土地所有制是独占组织之外而在政治上为最大及德国最强的经济力量的集中形式吗？
    联合国为完全根绝法西斯主义及纳粹主义而定的任务，同样也要求消灭法西斯强暴的经济基础。但在经济基础之中最重要的一项，就是容克的土地所有制。在割给波兰共和国的领土之上，德国容克世家的大庄园消灭了。但是在留给德国的领土之上，大的容克土地所有制还仍为一个大的危险的反动力量，所以只有这种力量的消灭，才成为未来的民主德国的一个前提。除财政独占者寡头而外，容克地主也是希特勒德国的真正主人。他们老早就是强盗侵略的挑衅者和仇视人类的狭义爱国主义会议的承担者。地主的大地产充当了德帝国主义的支柱。
    所以用不着惊奇，现在，德国民主的反法西斯人士提出了一个必须实行土地改革的问题。这种改革，一方面，必须消灭它最重要的经济基础，另一方面，需要满足农民以及由邻国迁入本国的德国人的土地欲望。只回忆一件事就够了，比如在勃兰登堡省，适于耕种的全部土地三分之一，就为大地主所操纵。在布累斯劳边区，一○六、七六八公顷适于栽培的土地，其中七一、三○八就由大地主所把持。地主实行怠工。在这种情形之下，举例来说，全部耕地的百分之三十二，现在就荒芜着。
    在新的民主的德国，不容构成普鲁士军国主义骨干的封建土地私有制和容克阶级的存在。德国土地改革的实行，实国家真正经久的民主化的必要条件。同时，德国容克封建主大土地所有制废除，可给国际范围的反动力量一个严重的打击。
    自然，大土地所有者是不甘心消灭他们一千年来的统治的。对的，他们在人民之中数量很少。不能单独进行斗争以抵抗民主的人民政府。但他们也不只一个人。各国的反动势力都站在他方面，他们在各阶层人民当中，散布着公开的和秘密的走狗。这些走狗暗藏在都市大财主们当中，而地主就利用工商及信托企业和他们的家庭取得联系。工业利润的追求者，在国家机关当中也有，这许多官吏，有的是出身于大地主，有的是在物质利益方面和他们有连带关系，最后，地主在乡村的上层分子之中，也找到他的走狗。
    反对土地改革的斗争，是利用种种方式进行的。某些农业“专家”抱怨说，大地产的分散，必引起农业的退化。地主在乡村中的走狗恐吓参加土地改革的贫农及农业工人说，地主在将来要向他们报复。旧行政当局的官僚们，则竭力拖延改革，希望来一次政变。
    反对土地改革的行动，往往采取着残酷的政治斗争的形式。举例来说，前波兰流亡“政府”为保卫大地产的利益，就与波兰临时政府斗争，利用法西斯的煽动及对波兰爱国分子卑鄙的暗杀手段，挑拨民族沙文主义的动机。
    在另一方面，跟着土地改革的实行，成千成万的农民及农业工人第一次参加政治生活。这个是意味着过去地主统治的国家之中最广大的民主人士的觉醒及组织。成立了上万农村委员会去帮助民主政府实现土地改革，并肃清反动力量。全面的土地改革，它本身彻底消灭！几千年来地主的统治，甚至至今还不知道狭隘的表面的民主的东欧和中欧的国家（但在其它国家之中早已实现。并有依恃着地主土地私有制的公开或不公开的反动的统治），其新的民主制度巩固的保证就在这里。
    同时千百万农民大众许多世纪以来关于土地所做的梦的实现，很明显的特征了这些在东欧诸解放国中取得政权的民主制度的进步性。这种真正的民主的收获，如地主土地私有权的废除及广大农民群众的分得土地，在历史的斤两上，是比外国报纸上连篇累牍的关于民主的无数抽象的哀伤要重至不可限量。至于对人民的民主国家或解放国家所责备的“专政”，那么这种诽谤，在不久的将来，最好也不过是一种盲目的惊人的果实。但土地改革的实现，将永远是欧洲进步史与欧洲民主史上重要的一章。
    欧洲若干国家之中的土地改革，实爱好自由人民在世界大战中粉碎了法西斯奴隶主后最重大的收获之一。它是这些国家人民民主的建立及巩固的基石，是保证各族人民自由与各族人民间的和平事业方面重要的因素。（解放日报一月十六日）
