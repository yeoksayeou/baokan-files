　　【This Dispatch from Changzhi】 The first "July 1st" and "July 7th" commemorative days since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War are approaching. The Taihang District Party Committee issued a notice instructing all localities to commemorate this great festival with practical actions to step up the mobilization of the masses, combined with the work of opposing the United States' assistance to the Kuomintang reactionaries in expanding the civil war and defending peace. On the 20th, it also convened all levels of the administrative office organs to discuss commemorative matters, and decided that "July 1st" to "July 7th" would be a commemorative week. All organs could conduct ideological inspections of cadres according to their own actual civil affairs, review the history of the eight-year Anti-Japanese War, examine their connection with the Party, the revolution, and the masses, and conduct current affairs banquets to the masses in the驻地(resident) area, exposing the conspiracy of the American imperialist elements to expand the civil war with military assistance to the Kuomintang reactionaries in recent times, pointing out that the root cause of the current serious civil war crisis is the American conspiracy. We resolutely oppose the United States' continued armed interference in China's internal affairs, demand that the United States immediately stop assisting the Kuomintang dictatorial government in expanding the civil war, withdraw American troops stationed in China, and mobilize the masses in the entire region to fight for preparing for self-defense, defending peace, and stopping the civil war. A commemorative meeting of cadres from all organs will be held on "July 1st," and mass meetings of nearby villages will be held on "July 7th" at the resident locations of the District Party Committee and the Administrative Office respectively. At present, all organs are actively preparing. The Political Department's Cultural Troupe is stepping up the production of the famous drama "Comrade, You've Gone the Wrong Way," and the Guangming Drama Troupe will present plays such as "Driven to Join the Liangshan Rebels" and "The 300th Anniversary of Jia Shen." The Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee will also compile and print propaganda points. The Taihang Xinhua Daily launched the New Heroism Movement in early June, proposing the working requirement of welcoming "July 1st" and "July 7th," studying Mao Zedong Thought, and putting forward the slogan of improving work and cadres a step further. The movement is currently underway.
