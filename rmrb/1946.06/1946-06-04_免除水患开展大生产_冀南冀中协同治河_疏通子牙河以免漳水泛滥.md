To eliminate floods permanently and launch this year's large-scale production campaign, the democratic governments of the Southern Hebei and Central Hebei liberated areas are jointly discussing river management work. On the 11th of last month, Comrade Wang Yantian of the Central Hebei Administrative Office's Public Works Bureau was specially dispatched to meet with Deputy Director Wang of the Southern Hebei Administrative Office, Deputy Director Li of the Construction Department, and Deputy Director Liu of the Wei (River) Yun (River) River Affairs Bureau to jointly discuss how to concentrate manpower and eliminate the problem of floods in the upstream and downstream rivers of the two regions. The following results have been agreed upon: (1) Both parties will send personnel to jointly survey the lower reaches of the Qingliang River, the old Zhang River, and the Erdao River, the eastern branch of the Heilong River, so that the water from the Qingliang River from the south and the water from the breaches of the Wei River and Yun River can be discharged. (2) Both parties will send personnel to the Bohai Administrative Office to jointly survey the Fuyang River (which flows into the Grand Canal from Nanxinglong Town, Dongjin, Cangxian County). If the measurements are suitable, a gate can be set up in Xinglong Town, so that when the river water rises sharply, the Grand Canal's water pressure can be diverted to avoid breaches. (3) Regarding the flood problems of the Fuyang River, this river originates from the foothills of the Taihang Mountains, passes through Southern Hebei and Central Hebei, and flows into the sea. Because the upstream is too close to the water source in the west, and the downstream Ziya River channel is too narrow, floods often break out in the summer and autumn seasons, and the river cannot discharge, resulting in flooding in the two regions. This time, it has been decided that the Central Hebei region will actively widen the river channel to ensure smooth water flow, while the upstream Southern Hebei region will strengthen dredging and repairing embankments to prevent flooding. (4) During the flood season, the Central Hebei and Southern Hebei regions should closely assist each other and strengthen mutual reporting of river conditions via telephone.

    免除水患开展大生产
    冀南冀中协同治河
    疏通子牙河以免漳水泛滥
    【本报威县专电】：为永远免除水患开展今年大生产运动，冀南冀中两解放区民主政府正协同商讨治河工作。上月十一日，冀中行署特派公务局王炎天同志前来，与冀南行署王副主任、建设处李副处长、卫（河）运（河）河务局刘副局长共同商讨如何集中人力，免除两区河流上下游水患问题。现已商得如下结果：（一）双方派员会同勘验清凉江下游老漳河及黑龙河东支二道河，使清凉江南来之水及卫河运河决口之水有所排泄。（二）双方派员前往渤海行署会同勘验浮炎河，（该河自沧县南兴隆镇东津流入运河）如测量合适，即可在兴隆镇设闸，当河水暴涨时，便可分运河水势而免溃决。（三）滏阳河水患问题，该河道源于太行山麓，经冀南冀中而入海，由于上游西距水源太近，下游子牙河之河道太狭，因此每当夏秋之季，往往洪水暴发，河不能泄，遂在两区泛滥成灾，这次决定冀中区积极修宽河道，务使水势流畅，上游之冀南区则加强浚河修堤，以免泛滥。（四）每当河水泛滥之期，冀中、冀南两区应密切互助，并在电话上加强河水情形的互相通报。
