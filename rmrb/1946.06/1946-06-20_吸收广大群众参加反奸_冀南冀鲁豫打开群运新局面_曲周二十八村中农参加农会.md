    【Report from this Newspaper】In Southern Hebei and Hebei-Shandong-Henan, efforts are being made to vigorously organize and mobilize middle peasants to participate in the mass movement of opposing traitors and local bullies, and speaking out about grievances and settling accounts, together with poor tenant farmers and hired laborers. According to reports from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan newspaper, in the past, attention was only paid to mobilizing hired tenants and poor peasants, without mobilizing the broad masses of middle peasants, forming an isolated and weak movement of hired tenants and poor peasants. In counties such as Cao and Heze, only ten or eight people were organized in each village. In Cao County's urban area, only 114 people were mobilized in more than forty days. Not only that, but in many areas, the interests of middle peasants were also harmed. In the fifth and sixth districts of Dongping, half of the struggle targets were small embezzlers and small running dogs with middle peasant backgrounds, while many heinous big traitors were not struggled against and remained at large. Recently, the leadership has reviewed this issue and is making great efforts to simultaneously mobilize middle peasants in the anti-traitor and grievance-telling movement. It is reported that both the Fourth District of Cao County and the First District of Boping held symposiums for activists at the end of last month, proposing "Middle peasants and poor peasants are one family, everyone should participate in the emancipation movement." Thirty-plus villages in the First District of Boping jointly developed a plan for developing farmers' associations, requiring the same absorption of middle peasants into farmers' associations, with each village proposing competitions against each other. After the Northern Sub-district of the Fourth District of Cao County held a meeting of activists, it established farmers' associations, youth associations, and women's associations in fourteen villages within two days, developing more than 400 members, and began brewing major and minor struggles in which more than a dozen middle peasants and poor peasants actively participated. On the fifth day, an anti-traitor and grievance-telling struggle involving 1,400 people in the entire sub-district unfolded. In Southern Hebei, similar major transformations are currently underway: 28 villages in the First District of Quzhou have established farmers' associations, all of which have absorbed broad masses of middle peasants to participate in the organization. After discussion, poor peasant members have all understood that middle peasants are also oppressed and exploited by traitors, local bullies, embezzlers, and even general landlords and usurers, clarifying the concept that "poor peasants and middle peasants are one family." After the middle peasants joined the farmers' associations, their emotions generally improved. Several middle peasant members in Zhang Village said, "After we joined the farmers' association, it felt like we took good medicine, with an unspeakable happiness in our hearts." In Hengshui Chengguan, the trade unions and poor people's associations in twelve towns absorbed many middle peasants and even wealthy middle peasants last month, organizing twelve joint farmers' associations. There were already 1,300 members, and they jointly accused and publicly tried Kang Shiwen and his son, director of the puppet Xinmin branch, as well as Shi Zezhong, Xiao Yuhua, Yang Tongquan, and other fifteen unrepentant traitors and local bullies, winning over 174 coerced followers.

    吸收广大群众参加反奸
    冀南冀鲁豫打开群运新局面
    曲周二十八村中农参加农会
    【本报讯】冀南、冀鲁豫各地，现正以大力组织与发动中农，使与贫苦佃农雇工等一道参加反汉奸、反恶霸、诉苦清算的群众运动。据冀鲁豫报导，过去由于只注意了发动雇佃贫农，而未发动广大中农，形成雇佃贫农的孤立，运动的无力。曹县、荷泽等县，每村组织起来的，不过十来八个人，曹县城区，四十多天只发动了一百一十四人，不仅如此，而且在许多地区还损害了中农利益。东平五、六区，斗争对象有一半是中农成份的小贪污分子与小走狗等，而许多罪恶滔天的大汉奸反倒未被斗争，逍遥法外。最近领导上对此问题已作了检讨，用大力在反奸诉苦运动中同时发动中农。据悉：曹县四区与博平一区，上月底均召开积极分子座谈会；提出“中农贫农是一家人，大家都应参加翻身运动”。博平一区三十多村联合作出发展农会计划，要同样吸收中农参加农会，各村互相提出竞赛。曹县四区北小区在开过积极分子会后，两天内成立了十四个村农会及青年妇女会等，发展会员四百多人，开始酝酿十多个中农贫农都积极参加的大小斗争。第五天就有一个全小区一千四百多人的反奸诉苦斗争展开了。冀南方面，目前也在进行同样的重大转变：曲周一区廿八村建立农会，都吸收了广大中农参加组织。贫农会员经过讨论，都了解到中农也受汉奸、恶霸、贪污分子以至一般地主高利贷者的压迫与剥削，明确了“贫农中农都是一家人”的观念。中农参加农会后，情绪一般都提高了。张庄有好几个中农会员说：“我们参加了农会，好象吃了好药，心里说不出来的痛快。”在衡水城关，十二镇的工会与贫民会，上月份都吸收了许多中农以至富裕中农参加，组织了十二个农民联合会。已有会员一千三百人，并联合控诉与公审了伪新民分会主任康石稳父子及石泽中、萧玉华、杨同泉等无恶不作的汉奸恶霸十五人，争取了胁从分子一百七十四人。
