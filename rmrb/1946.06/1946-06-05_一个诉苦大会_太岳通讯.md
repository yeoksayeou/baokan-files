    A Grievance Meeting
    ——Taiyue Correspondence
    The in-depth development of the rent reduction movement in the third district of Jincheng was promoted by a district-wide grievance meeting. In mid-May, the third district held a meeting of 1,070 people in Pingtou Village, attended by debtors, tenant farmers, hired laborers, sheep herders, and impoverished women, most of whom were leaders in past struggles, some of whom were village cadres. The meeting lasted five days, during which 722 people recounted their grievances and sought the root of their poverty. Through this meeting, the masses' awareness and determination to struggle were greatly enhanced.
    When Li Shangbao, an old man from the Xingbi group, and his family of three tearfully recounted how the landlord had stripped them of all their property, leaving the whole family homeless, the entire group shed tears. Hired laborer Zhao Quanzheng recalled the bitterness of being exploited and bullied in the past, and couldn't sleep all night, crying loudly in his quilt early in the morning. Chang Yinlan, a woman from Liu Village, recounted how the landlord Chen Zubing collected rent from her, drove her out of her own home, leaving her to freeze in a temple in the dead of winter, and sold her own son. Zhou Baoxing from Shouneng Village recounted how his father worked as a coppersmith in Ningxia, getting up at five in the morning and sleeping past midnight for more than twenty years, yet it was not enough to pay the interest to the creditor Zhou Tuhe. He initially borrowed only five silver dollars from Zhou Shihe, but ended up selling all his family property and even selling his sister to pay the debt! Wang Shui and his mother (a poor old woman) from Pingshui Village originally came to listen to the meeting, but also started sobbing and recounting their own grievances.
    In order to make those who recounted their grievances more clearly aware that the root of their suffering was feudal exploitation, the leadership provided timely enlightenment, allowing everyone to engage in discussion. For example, Li Haishui from Mapingtou Village had worked as a long-term laborer for sixteen years. He felt this was "fate" and thought the landlord was not bad, as he had even found him a wife. The leadership raised the question of "Why did he find him a wife?" and everyone engaged in heated debate based on the facts. Finally, Li Haishui suddenly realized: they weren't finding him a wife for his sake, but to have a maid and a cook! At the same time, this tied him down, making him resign himself to suffering for the rest of his life!
    This grievance meeting further promoted the awakening and unity of the masses. When Wang Shui and his mother from Pingtou Village recounted how creditors, landlords, and bullies all forced her to flee with her family, and how they were severely beaten when they encountered the enemy, the entire audience suddenly stood up and shouted, "Your pain is the pain of all of us! Farmers all over the world are one family!" The village cadre from that village also immediately criticized himself for the mistake of not resolving this problem for the old woman for more than a year. This eliminated the lingering resentment that the old woman had harbored in her heart.
    The grievances and awakening of the masses also deeply educated and enlightened the cadres. Comrade Zhang Suocheng from Sihe Village reflected and said: "I am also an oppressed person, I have suffered a lot of pain, but after eating other people's oil cakes, I forgot about the poor, I am truly ashamed!" He said, breaking down in tears. His self-criticism made all 214 village cadres present deeply feel the blood connection between themselves and the masses, and feel that the work they had done in the past was far from enough, and that they still had many mistakes. Therefore, they consciously conducted a painful self-criticism and "washed their faces." For example, in terms of work style, they engaged in taking over everything, ordering the masses around, putting on airs in front of the masses, delaying solving problems, and even some individuals were seduced by landlords and forgot the suffering of the masses. The village cadres at the meeting finally vowed: "We will never be separated from the masses again!" All the village cadres resolved to lead the masses to completely turn over.
    This grievance meeting awakened the masses from the long-term pain of exploitation, and the leadership also realized that in the past, the so-called masses "having no grievances to recount" was due to the masses' lack of awareness. Since this meeting, a fierce struggle has unfolded everywhere in the district.

    一个诉苦大会
    ——太岳通讯
    晋城三区减租运动的深入开展，是经过一次全区的诉苦大会推动起来的。五月中旬，三区在坪头村召开了一千零七十人的大会，到会的有债户、佃户、雇工、羊工、贫苦妇女等，多半是过去斗争中的带头人，其中有些是村干部。会经五天，有七百二十二人诉苦、找穷根，经过这次会，群众觉悟与斗争决心有很大提高。
    幸壁小组李商保老汉一家三口，哭诉地主把自己财产剥削尽净，害得全家无家可归时，全组下泪；雇工赵全正就想起了自己过去受剥削欺侮的苦境，一夜没睡觉，清早在被子里大哭起来。刘村妇女常银兰诉说地主陈祖秉向她收租，把她赶出自己的家门，大冬天在庙里受冻，卖掉亲生儿子。瘦能村周保兴诉说他爹在宁夏当铜匠，起五更睡半夜干了二十多年，不够债主周土和的利钱，当初借周士和不过五元银洋，结果把家产卖光，又卖了妹子来还账！坪水村王水和他娘（一个穷老太太）本是来听会，也随着呜咽着诉起自己的苦来。
    为使诉苦的人更清楚的认识自己痛苦的根源是封建剥削，领导上进行了及时的启发，让大家展开讨论。比如马坪头村李海水，当过十六年长工，他觉得这是“命”，并以为地主还不错，曾给他娶了个媳妇。领导上提出“为什么人家给他娶媳妇”的问题，大家根据事实热烈争论起来，最后李海水恍然大悟：人家不是为他娶媳妇，而是要用个老妈子和做饭的！同时也拿这拴住了他，让他死心受一辈子！
    这次诉苦更促进了群众的觉醒和团结。坪头村水和他娘诉到债主、地主、恶霸们一齐逼迫她，使她全家逃走，又遇着敌人，被痛打时，全场猛然起立，高呼“你的痛苦就是我们大家的痛苦！天下农民是一家！”该村干部当场也检讨到一年多没给老太太解决这一问题的错误。这使老太太心里老存着的闲气也消除了。
    群众的诉苦与觉醒也深刻教育与启发了干部，四河张锁成同志反省说：“我也是受压迫的人，受过许多痛苦，可是吃上人家的油馍就忘了穷人，真亏心呀！”他说得失声痛哭起来。他的反省，使二百一十四个到会的村干部都痛切的感到自身与群众的血肉相连，感到过去所做的工作还十分不够，自己还有不少错误，于是自觉的进行了痛切的检讨、洗脸。如作风上的包办代替、命令群众，对群众摆架子，有问题拖延不解决，甚至有个别的受地主引诱，忘掉群众痛苦等。下村干部最后发誓说：“以后绝不再脱离群众！”全体村干部决心领导群众彻底翻身。
    这次诉苦，使群众从过去长期剥削痛苦里苏醒过来，领导上也认识到过去所谓群众“没苦可诉，是群众觉悟没提高的缘故。自这次大会后，该区到处展开了猛烈的斗争。
