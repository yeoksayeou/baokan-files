    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 11th: Nanjing Dispatch: Amidst the fierce opposition of the people in various places, this city has implemented the "Police District System" since May 17th. The police department has divided the entire city into several districts, each with one police chief and nine police officers, governing 200 to 300 households, or 1,500 to 2,000 people. Each district is equipped with telephones and new-style machine guns, ready to be dispatched at any time to arrest people. Nanjing newspapers, afraid to speak out, also reveal some voices of opposition. One newspaper, in a short commentary titled "An Unwarranted New Shackle," said, "We truly admire the gentleman who thought so well, making it even more thorough than the 'Baojia' system and the issuance of 'Good Citizen Certificates' during the enemy puppet era!" A foreign-language newspaper said, "This kind of method is already commonplace in Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo." Another newspaper used the headline "The Capital's Ordinary People Must Pay Attention Starting Today; Suddenly Implementing Police Districts in an Era of Loudly Praised Freedom; Door-to-Door Visits Allegedly Not for Managing the People" for this news. At the same time, the police department also announced the strengthening of plainclothes police activities, changing the existing detective team into a "Criminal Police Officer Team." Department Chief Han Wenhuan concurrently serves as the team leader. He instructed the detective team: "Today's work should reduce the visible and increase the invisible (the visible refers to armed police, the invisible refers to plainclothes police), ensuring that our plainclothes police are active in any place and any class." Also, news from Zhenjiang indicates that the "Police District System" will also be implemented there, and the division of districts is currently underway.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 10th: Chongqing Dispatch: At around 9 PM on the 13th of last month, Jiaochangkou Square was suddenly surrounded by a large number of police and security teams, cutting off traffic. All vendors, performers, audience members, pedestrians, etc., inside and outside the square were inspected, and more than 200 people were arrested (including 40 to 50 women), all detained at the Second Branch of the Zhonghua Road Police Station. Local residents are all living in fear. Afterwards, according to a police officer, this incident was ordered by the authorities to arrest "unemployed vagrants." Except for a portion who were released, the rest have been sent to the police headquarters and will be sent to vagrant training centers for training. It is reported that there are 50,000 unemployed workers in Chongqing today, most of whom have become "unemployed vagrants."

    箝制人民胜过敌伪时代
    南京实行“警管区制”
    重庆较场口有吏夜捉人
    【新华社延安十一日电】南京讯：在各地人民猛烈反对中，此间已于五月十七日起实行“警管区制”，警厅划全市为若干区，每区有警长一人，警员九人，管辖二百至三百户、一千五百至二千人。每区所设有电话机及新式机枪，以备随时出动捕人。不敢说话的南京报纸，也透露出若干反对之声。某报在“莫须有的新枷锁”为题的短评中说：“我们真佩服那位先生想得如此好，竟比敌伪时代的办‘保甲’、发‘良民证’还要弄得彻底”！一个外文报说：“此种办法，在柏林、罗马、东京、原已司空是惯”。另一报纸在这个消息的标题上说：“首都老百姓今天起要注意，高唱自由时代忽实行警管区，挨家访问据说非管理人民”。与此同时，警厅又公布加强便衣警察活动，将现有侦缉队改为“刑事警官队”，厅长韩文焕自兼队长，他对侦缉队训话说：“今天工作应减少有形，增加无形（有形指武装警察，无形指便衣警察），务使任何场所任何阶层，均有我便衣活动”。又讯：据镇江来人谈，该地也将实行警管区制，现在划分管区。
    【新华社延安十日电】渝讯：上月十三日晚九时许，较场口广场突被大批警察保安队层层包围，一时交通断绝，所有场内外摊贩、卖艺者、观众、行人等，全被检查，共捕去二百多人（内妇女四五十人），全部拘禁于中华路警察二分局。当地居民均人人自危。事后据某警士谈：此事件系当局令捕“无业游民”，除一部释放外，其余已解警察总局，将送游民训练所训练。按今日渝市失业工人五万人，大部已变成“无业游民”。
