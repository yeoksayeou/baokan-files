Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 18th. The puppet army Zhao Baoyuan's troops, numbering over 300, entrenched in Jimo city, abandoned the city and fled at 4 PM on the 16th, under the cover of seven Kuomintang reactionaries' planes. Our Eighth Route Army thus recovered the city. Jimo city was first captured by our army in 1938. On August 26th of last year, our army liberated it for the second time from the Japanese invaders, and on the 27th, it was forcibly occupied by the enemy puppet troops directed by the Kuomintang reactionaries. This is the third liberation.

Xinhua News Agency, Jiaohe, 18th. Two Kuomintang American-style planes indiscriminately bombed Jiaohe at 3 PM on the 17th, wounding four of our soldiers and killing one horse. Three Americans from the Executive Headquarters were in Jiaohe at the time and immediately took shelter in air-raid shelters. Afterwards, an American Lieutenant Colonel said, "Today we know who is responsible for the Sino-Communist war that has lasted for months."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. (Delayed) Military News: After Chiang Kai-shek issued the ceasefire order, the Kuomintang army in the Northeast attacked Faku from the southeast and southwest. Our army withdrew from Faku county seat on the 8th. This is the first county town occupied by the Kuomintang army after the ceasefire.

Our newspaper, Handan, 18th. The Eighth Route Army and the local people of Xiuwu, who have been repeatedly attacked by the Kuomintang army and the Boa'i and Wuzhi Kuomintang security regiments, were forced to defend themselves on the 13th of this month. They completely defeated the Kuomintang Boa'i and Wuzhi security regiments entrenched in fifteen villages, including Xiuwu, Wangtun, Zhangtun, Qian Houdongcun, Futun, Jiayeling, Xueyeling, Xiayeling, Yuezhuang, Yuanhezhuang, and Yangzhuang. More than 100 enemies were killed or captured, and two light machine guns and more than 40 rifles were seized. The people of the liberated fifteen villages immediately destroyed all 41 blockhouses that had been ruling them. They are now rapidly restoring their peaceful homes.

    【新华社莱阳十八日电】盘据即墨城伪军赵保元部三百余人，十六日下午四时，在国民党反动派七架飞机掩护下，弃城逃窜，该城遂为我八路军恢复。按即墨城早在一九三八年时，即为我军一度攻克。去年八月二十六日我军二次由日寇手中光复，二十七日复为国民党反动派指使的敌伪军强占。此次系为第三次解放。
    【新华社蛟河十八日电】国民党美式飞机两架，于十七日下午三时，滥肆投弹轰炸蛟河，炸伤我士兵四人，炸死马一匹。执行小组三位美国人此时正在蛟河，当即躲入防空洞。事后美人一中校说：“今天我们已知道国共战争历时数月，谁应负责了。”
    【新华社延安十八日电】（迟到）军息：东北国民党军在蒋介石发布停战令后，自东南、西南两面向法库进攻，我军于八日撤离法库县城。按此乃停战后国民党军侵占的第一个县城。
    【本报邯郸十八日电】历次遭受国民党军及博爱、武陟国民党保安团进攻之修武八路军与当地人民，于本月十三日被迫自卫，将盘据修武、王屯、张屯、前后董村、傅屯、贾叶岭、薛业岭、夏业岭、岳庄、原和庄、杨庄等十五村之国民党博爱、武陟保安团全部击溃，毙俘百余人，缴轻机枪二挺，步枪四十余支。解放后的十五村人民，当即将统治自己的四十一座碉堡全部平毁，现正迅速恢复自己和平的家园。
