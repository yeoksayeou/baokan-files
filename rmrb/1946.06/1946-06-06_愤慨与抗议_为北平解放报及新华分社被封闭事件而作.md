Indignation and Protest
On the Closure of the Beiping Jiefang Bao and Xinhua Branch
Yang Xiufeng

The fascist warmongers are the most brutal and also the most foolish.
In order to cover up their shameful deeds that cannot bear the light of day, and the crimes hated by all the Chinese people, they do not hesitate to adopt all kinds of brutal and despicable means in an attempt to make the common people neither know nor hear.

However, "their hearts may be cunning, but their plans are truly clumsy." Brutality only arouses greater anger among the people. "Preventing the people's mouths is more dangerous than preventing a river." Where is the authority of the fascist forefathers Mussolini and Hitler now? Hasn't the Emperor's forbidden land already become a place of roaring anger? Chinese fascist warmongers, you don't even have the wisdom to learn from historical lessons. Do you think that by closing down newspaper offices and news agencies, beating reporters to death, suppressing newsboys, tearing up newspapers, prohibiting meetings, and suppressing speakers, you can make the common people neither know nor hear about your shameful deeds and crimes, let alone question them? Can you consolidate one-party rule "as solid as golden soup" and even make it "eternal"? If you do this out of "humiliation turning to anger" and "staking everything on one throw," or attempt to "seek temporary fortune" and "take risks," then it can be said to be second-rate stupidity; but if you think that this can truly "block people's sight and hearing" and turn the 450 million people into "idiots," then it is truly "unparalleled in its foolishness."

Lu Xun said, "The tyranny of tyrants turns people into cold cynicism." Have you also seen the Chinese people's miserable "cold cynicism" towards you? The avalanche of telegrams and the surging demonstrations are less a protest against your brutality than a cold cynicism towards your stupidity! Your countless instances of "Sanyang Kaitai, Wuzi Dengke [idiomatic expressions implying good luck and prosperity]," "recognizing the enemy as father," "befriending the puppet regime," and, repeatedly, the crimes of "disregarding the people's lives," "breaking faith and abandoning righteousness," and "inherent warmongering," have made people unable to even write telegrams to protest and demonstrate, and have made them feel disgusted. The emotion of "cold cynicism" has turned into the "bitter smile" of indignation, turning into a great force of resistance! Today is a big step forward compared to Lu Xun's time. The "people who dare to speak, dare to cry, dare to be angry, and dare to fight" have greatly increased, so much that you cannot measure them and dare not measure them. So many that they have the power to "repel the cursed era in this cursed place."

You should have some awareness! Thinking that by closing the People's mouthpiece, the Jiefang Bao, and the People's eyes and ears, the Xinhua News Agency, you can prevent your "shameful deeds" and "crimes" from spreading far and wide, prevent your "crimes" from being known to anyone, and allow your "one-party rule" to survive. You are wrong. "What ten eyes see and ten hands point at," "what ten thousand people point at will die without disease," has been the case since ancient times, let alone today! Tell the Chinese fascist warmongers, the "cold cynicism" and "anger" of hundreds of millions of people are terrifying. If you are a little smarter, you should learn from the lessons your forefathers encountered. All Chinese people who love peace and value integrity are waiting for your repentance!

    愤慨与抗议
    为北平解放报及新华分社被封闭事件而作
    杨秀峰
    法西斯好战分子最残暴也最愚蠢。
    为了掩盖他们见不起人的丑行与为全中国人民所痛恨的罪行，不惜采取种种残暴而卑污的手段来企图达到使老百姓不知不闻。
    然而“其心虽巧，其计诚拙”。残暴徒然激起人们更大的愤怒，“防民之口甚于防川”，法西斯祖师莫索里尼和希特勒之威风而今安在？天皇的禁地不已成为万人怒吼的场所吗？中国法西斯好战分子，你们竟连一点领取历史教训的智慧都没有了，你们以为封闭了报馆通讯社，打死记者，镇压报童，撕毁报纸，禁止开会打讲演者等等手法，就可以使老百姓对你们的丑行与罪行不知不闻以至不问吗？就可以把一党专政“巩若金瓯”以至“万世一系”吗？如果你们这样作是由于“恼羞成怒”而“孤注一掷”，或者企图“侥幸一时”而“挺而走险”，那还可说是次一等的愚蠢；但如果你们以为这样就真可以“绝人视听”，使四万五千万人民会成了“阿斗”，那真是“其愚为不可及”了。
    鲁迅说过：“暴君的专制使人们变成冷嘲”，你们是否也看出了中国人民对你们凄绝的“冷嘲”？雪片般的文电，潮涌般的示威，与其说是对你们残暴的抗议，毋宁说是对你们愚蠢的冷嘲！你们无数件的“三洋开泰，五子登科”“认敌作父”“以伪为友”的丑态，再接再厉的，“不恤民命”“背信弃义”“好战性成”的罪恶，使人们连写电报抗议示威都来不及了，都感到憎恶了，“冷嘲”的情感已转成了愤恨的“苦笑”，转成了伟大的反抗力量！今天比鲁迅当年时代又进了一大步，“敢说、敢哭、敢怒、敢打”的“真要活下去的人们”大大的增多了，多到你们无可计量也不敢计量。多到有力量“在这可咀咒的地方，击退了可咀咒的时代”。
    你们应该有些觉悟！以为封闭了人民喉舌的解放报与人民耳目的新华社，就可以使你们的“丑行”与“罪恶”，不致远扬，使你们的“罪恶”无人知道，使你们的“一党专政”可以苟延残喘。你们错了，“十目所视，十手所指”“万夫所指，无疾而终”，自古已然何况今日！告正中国法西斯好战分子们，亿万人的“冷嘲”与“愤怒”是可怕的，你们祖师所遭遇的教训，如果你们还聪明些是应该领取的。全中国爱好和平，素尚廉耻的人民在等候你们的悔悟！
