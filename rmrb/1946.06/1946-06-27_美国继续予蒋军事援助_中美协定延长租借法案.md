Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th: TASS, New York, 23rd: Well-informed sources indicate that an agreement has been reached between the Chinese and U.S. governments to extend the Lend-Lease Act under a new name until November 1947. This agreement stipulates the arming of Nationalist troops and the supply of all necessary equipment. This move inevitably recalls the Associated Press report on the 14th of this month, that Byrnes had requested Congress to formulate a new plan for military aid to China. Another report: Negotiations on the unconditional U.S. $700 million loan to China some time ago have now been temporarily suspended because the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury proposed reducing the amount of the loan while also putting forward certain conditions to be borne by the borrower.

　　美国继续予蒋军事援助
    中美协定延长租借法案
    【新华社延安二十四日电】塔斯社纽约二十三日电：消息灵通方面息，中美两国政府之间已有协定，将租借法案在新的名义下，延长至一九四七年十一月，此协定规定武装国民党军队，并供给一切必须的装备。此举不免令人忆及本月十四日美联社之报导，即贝纳斯已要求国会制订军事援助中国的新计划的消息。又讯：不久前美国无条件对华七万万美元贷款的谈判，目下已暂告停顿。因为美国财政部长提议减少贷款数目，同时又提出借款人应负担的某些条件。
