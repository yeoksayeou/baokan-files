[Changzhi News from Our Newspaper] The Changzhi County convened a county and district cadre meeting on the 12th of this month, summarizing the production campaign of the past month. It reviewed the guiding principles and leadership, and decided that the future direction would be: to consolidate and improve mutual aid organizations and to launch a large-scale production campaign.

Changzhi, after thorough rent reduction, carried out a major production mobilization in early April and began to organize mutual aid. In mid-April, under the slogans of "Get Organized," "Prosper Through Production," and "Settle Down According to Wealth," mutual aid groups were widely organized in various villages. Statistics from only the second, third, and fifth districts showed 3,921 groups, with 23,523 laborers participating. In the process of organizing, a sowing campaign of people pulling plows and digging the ground was launched. In the second and fifth districts, manual plowing reached 130,700 mu, which solved the difficulty of insufficient livestock and made the masses realize the power of being organized.

The reasons for the rapid development of this campaign were: (1) After rent reduction, the production conditions of farmers, such as land, livestock, and grain, were greatly improved, and many activists who had been emancipated became the backbone and locomotives in the production campaign. (2) The new areas have suffered severe damage from the enemy and puppets in recent years, and livestock, farm tools, and labor are particularly scarce. Many people are unable to carry out production independently and urgently demand to be organized.

Because the leadership did not understand the local people's economic and production base sufficiently, there was also a tendency to overemphasize agricultural production, neglect sideline occupations, and crack down on sideline occupations. For example, ordering the masses to stop ironwork, transportation, and workshops, and refusing to issue road passes to the masses who went out for transportation, were practices that did not suit the specific conditions. For example, in areas such as Yincheng and Bayi, half of the population could not live without coal and iron production. Jingfang Village in the third district had more than 100 large transportation carts before the war, and some people relied entirely on petty trading and workshops for a living, while agriculture was only an incidental labor for them. Therefore, our policy is to focus on agriculture and to combine agriculture, handicrafts, and sideline industries well to launch a thriving large-scale production campaign. In terms of organizational form, it cannot be a single agricultural mutual aid group; there should be diverse forms of mutual aid, and the time and number of people should not be rigid.

The county is now carrying out a movement to summarize achievements and rectify mutual aid in order to further advance the Changzhi large-scale production campaign in the upcoming weeding and summer harvest campaign.

    长治总结春耕运动
    主要经验：应了解新区条件，具体领导，组织各种互助。
    【本报长治讯】长治县，在本月十二日召开的县、区干部会上，总结了一月来的生产运动。检查了方针与领导，并决定了今后方向为：巩固与提高互助组织，开展大生产运动。经过深入减租的长治，四月初即进行了生产大动员，开始组织互助。四月中在“组织起来”，“生产发家”，“按富根”等口号下，各村普遍组织了互助组。仅二、三、五三个区统计：即达三千九百二十一小组，参加劳力达二万三千五百二十三人。组织过程中展开了一个人拉犁、人刨地的下种运动。二区和五区的人力翻地，即达十三万零七百余亩，解决了牲口不足的困难，而且使群众认识了组织起来的力量。这一运动开展迅速的原因：（一）农民经过减租后，土地、牲口、粮食等生产条件大为改善，许多翻身的积极分子，都成了生产运动中的骨干与火车头。（二）新区几年来遭受敌伪严重的破坏，牲口、农具、劳力等都特别缺乏，许多群众陷于无法单独进行生产的境况，迫切要求组织起来。由于领导上对当地群众经济、生产基础了解不够，因此也产生了过份强调农业生产，忽视副业、打击副业的偏向，如命令群众停止铁业、运输、作坊，群众出外运输不给开路条等不适合具体条件的作法，如荫城、八义等区，没有煤铁业生产，一半群众就不能生活。三区经坊村，战前有一百多大车运输，部分群众是全靠小买卖与开作坊为生，而农业在他们只是附带的劳动，因此我们的方针是以农业为主，把农业、手工业、副业各方面生产很好的结合起来，开展一个热火朝天的大生产运动。在组织形式上，不能是单一的农业互助组，应有多样性的互助，在时间上，人数上都不能死板。现该县正开展一个总结成果，整顿互助的运动，以便在行将到来的锄苗与夏收运动中，把长治大生产运动，更向前推进一步。
