　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: Paris dispatch: On the 20th, crowds of Communist Party and trade union members marched through the streets of Paris and gathered in front of the French Communist Party Central Committee headquarters for a rally lasting three and a half hours to protest the attack on the French Communist Party headquarters by fascist remnants and reactionaries on the 19th. The masses sang the Internationale and the Marseillaise, shouting slogans such as "Down with the reactionaries! Eliminate fascism! Let us unite for the Republic!" French Communist Party leaders Thorez, Duclos, and Marty stood on the balcony of the Communist Party headquarters and were warmly cheered by the crowd. It is reported that on the 19th, reactionary elements smashed the doors and windows of the French Communist Party headquarters and burned the looted propaganda pamphlets in the streets. The reactionaries' provocation occurred during De Gaulle's radio address commemorating the sixth anniversary of the French people's resistance to Germany. Reactionary elements openly clamored: "De Gaulle should regain power and burn Thorez at the stake!" After the incident, the French Communist Party and the Paris Trade Union Federation issued a public statement protesting this fascist crime and calling on the working class of Paris to hold a protest strike and demonstration at 5 p.m. on the 20th.
