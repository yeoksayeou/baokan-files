Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) demands the abolition of the Yoshida government and the dissolution of the Imperial Diet. A high-ranking JCP official stated that the JCP has carefully studied the history of all past Diet members and found that 80 to 100 members of the current Diet are liable to be purged by MacArthur. The list of these individuals and their histories will be published in the Communist Party's monthly magazine and distributed to Japanese newspapers for publication. To support this movement to overthrow the Yoshida government and dissolve the Diet, the JCP will coordinate with the labor movement from June 20th to July 10th. At that time, labor rallies, demonstrations, strikes, and the implementation of labor management of factories may be held. The JCP's "blacklist" includes about 30 Liberal Party members, 30 Social Democratic Party members, 20 Progressive Party members, and a few others. The evidence collected by the JCP is very solid, and they are confident that these individuals will be removed from office. According to a JCP official, because they do not believe the Yoshida government will take positive action against those who should be purged as pointed out by the Communist Party, the Communist Party has submitted the first list of 30 individuals to the Allied Headquarters and the delegations of the Allied Council for Japan. Notable figures on the JCP's "blacklist" include Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida, Minister of Health and Welfare Ryokawa Kawai, Minister of Commerce and Industry Jiro Hoshijima, Minister of Finance Kanzō Ishibashi, and three Ministers without Portfolio, Kihachi, Uehara Etsujiro, and Sadakichi Hashi. The Communist Party accuses Yoshida of participating in the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact. Minister of Health and Welfare Kawai served as an economic advisor to the puppet governments in Beijing and Nanjing. The Minister of Commerce and Industry is accused of supporting the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" in the 1942 Tojo election. Minister of Finance Kanzo Ishibashi was a member of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association in 1942. Ishibashi wrote many articles advocating for the control of the economy using Nazi methods. As for the other three Ministers without Portfolio, the Communist Party accuses them of supporting the war through articles or speeches during the war, demonstrating extreme militarist ambitions.

    日共提出战犯“黑名单”
    要求清洗吉田政府解散议会
    并将发动劳工运动进行强烈斗争
    【新华社延安十日电】东京讯：日共要求废除吉田政府与解散帝国议会，日共高级负责人称：日共仔细研究了所有过去议员的历史，发现此届议会有八十至一百名议员，均可归在麦克阿瑟清洗者之列。这些人的名单与历史，将在共产党月刊上公布，同时将分发给日本各报发表。为了支持这一推翻吉田政府与解散议会的运动，日共将于六月二十日至七月十日期间的劳工运动，取得配合行动。届时可能举行劳工大会、示威、罢工，以及实行劳工管理工厂。日共之“黑名单”里，包括约三十个自由党议员，三十个社会民主党议员，二十个进步党议员，以及少数其它人等。日共所搜集的证据，十分确凿，并深信他们将被免职。据日共负责人称：因为不相信吉田政府会对共产党指出的这些应被清洗者采取积极行动，所以共产党已将首批三十人之名单，送交盟军总部及盟国对日委员会各代表团。日共所编制之“黑名单”中的著名人物们，包括首相吉田茂、厚生大臣河合良川、工商大臣星岛二郎、藏相石桥堪三，及三个不管部阁员币原、植原悦二郎、桥定吉一。共产党指斥吉田曾参加了反共公约之签订事。厚生省大臣河合，曾任北京及南京伪政府的经济顾问。工商大臣被斥为在一九四二年东条选举中拥护“大东亚共荣圈”。藏相石桥堪三，在一九四二年为大政翼赞会会员，石桥曾作了许多文章，拥护以纳粹的方法管制经济。至于其他三不管阁员，共产党指责他们在战争期间以文章或以演说支持战争，表示出极端军国主义的野心。
