Shanghai, though Chinese territory, has long been called an international city. Before the war, prominent figures and their wealth, both Chinese and foreign, were mostly concentrated in the concessions, which became the epitome of everything exquisite, forming a unique area unlike any other in the world. After the victory, the concessions were finally reclaimed, but the special phenomena did not disappear. Walking through the streets that were once leased, one still sees a multitude of foreigners, hearing and seeing little that is Chinese. Among these foreigners, the Americans are the most numerous and active.

(1) American Soldiers: American soldiers are our best allies, having helped us greatly during the eight years of resistance against Japan. These friends who have contributed to our cause should be rewarded handsomely. Therefore, the wives and daughters of the big shots and gentlemen, in order to treat the Allied forces well, might as well make an exception and engage in public social events to strengthen "diplomatic relations." The Americans appear particularly "lively" in these situations. The Allied forces' activity is performed everywhere in China, and Shanghai is no exception. Shanghai is the largest city in China, with countless streets. On every street in Shanghai, one can see groups of Allied friends in yellow or black uniforms, and jeeps belonging to the Allied friends one after another. These cars drive recklessly, and there are frequent news reports of people being hit or run over. Although the latter's driving speed has been limited, the record of hitting people has not decreased. Even the famous writers Xia Yan and Ge Baoquan were injured in accidents. In addition to jeeps, the Allied friends are also frequent patrons of rickshaws and pedicabs. They sit in the cars, happily "making noise" and "laughing loudly" all the way. Especially in less crowded places, the performances are even more impressive. Every evening after dusk, the entertainment venues and bars in Shanghai are illuminated by neon lights like paradise. The Allied friends go in laughing and joking, and come out drunk, bumping into things. If they meet a man, they punch him; if it is a woman, they first try to flirt with her, then force a kiss. People who understand the psychology of the Allied forces say they are "lively," but most people think they look down on the Chinese. The Ta Kung Pao published a letter from a girl on March 21st saying, "There were five or six American sailors walking in front of me. As my car passed by them, it attracted their attention. Suddenly, my car was grabbed by an American soldier, and he jumped onto my car like a beast, grabbing my body and trying to act indecently. This behavior is simply a great insult and discrimination; it is an insult to the Chinese people. People look down on our country, so they are openly rude to our people." Afterwards, General Wedemeyer, in order to maintain the reputation of the U.S. military, said that he would "severely punish without leniency once the investigation is clear" and sent personnel to apologize to the insulted woman's family. However, shortly after this expression of "severe punishment without leniency," the Sichuan Road incident occurred, followed by the robbery by American soldiers and the assault on the American-Sari Pharmacy by American soldiers. This is not very glorious for the Allied military authorities. Admiral Kirk, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, received a report confirming that naval personnel in the city did indeed have irregular actions. From March 21st, he ordered eight U.S. warships to be canceled within a time limit and prohibited from going ashore. At the same time, the U.S. Naval Police fully cooperated with Chinese officials to ensure that U.S. naval personnel would no longer engage in illegal activities. However, naval personnel were still visible everywhere, and there were continued reports of sailors robbing diamond rings.

(2) Japanese: The Japanese are people from an enemy country who remained in Shanghai. The Japanese became our prisoners. As prisoners, the Japanese, compared with the rampant American sailors, are of course "inferior." However, compared with us Chinese, judging from their clothing alone, they are several times more wealthy. It is said that the prisoners in the concentration camp are treated very well. This is evidenced by the Japanese encountered on the streets and in military vehicles, who often show an arrogant demeanor. The Japanese are formally our prisoners, but psychologically they are still our masters. Our tolerance can never influence the hearts of the Japanese prisoners, who are all waiting for a chance to turn over. Sure enough, the opportunity came. Due to the Northeast issue, a wave of anti-Soviet sentiment arose at home and abroad. The Japanese concentration camp actually cheered for the origin of the Third World War. The Japanese Residents' Autonomous Association held an emergency meeting and announced: (1) The United States and the Soviet Union have opened fire. (2) General MacArthur has ordered the rearmament of Japan. (3) Former Japanese military commander Matsui ordered in the Japanese prisoner-of-war camp that the transfer of Japanese prisoners back to their country be stopped. Although the result was an illusion, a disappointment, it gave us a valuable hint: if China cannot unite, if it cannot take the path of democracy, the embers of the Japanese will surely rekindle, and the Japanese prisoners are waiting for an opportunity to come back. Earlier this month, the Shanghai Japanese Residents Management Office conducted a poll of Japanese residents, and the results showed that 35,130 Japanese men and women all wanted to retain the Emperor. From these places, it can be seen that we have not conquered the Japanese. Our tolerance is tantamount to "nurturing a tiger," leaving behind future troubles that we will eventually suffer.

(3) Chinese Common Soldiers: Chinese soldiers are called "Qiu Ba," I don't know when this started. According to the general explanation, "Qiu Ba" represents being unreasonable. This is still everywhere and does not need to be exemplified. However, during the bloody eight years of war, the heroic fighting, suffering and hardship of the Chinese soldiers has changed the previous impression of "Qiu Ba." However, some soldiers in Shanghai give a worse impression than the previous "Qiu Ba." Most of them are temporarily converted from puppet soldiers. This can also be found in their clothing. The woolen uniforms and riding boots they inherited from the Japanese, when worn, are indeed more imposing than genuine soldiers, and they are also more popular in Shanghai than genuine soldiers. Of course, they are more adept at bullying the common people than genuine soldiers. They eat in restaurants without paying, they disrupt rickshaws and pedicabs, and they make trouble in movie theaters. Of course, it is by order that they don't pay when they take the tram, but they still constantly stop the tram and beat the motorman. As long as the collar badge has a gold line or a small lieutenant's flower, once on the tram, they are imposing, cursing people, hitting people, and it has become commonplace. Others look sideways and remain silent. Because the Shanghai people were liberated from the hands of the Japanese, they have learned enough about this style, who would dare to meddle again. Therefore, these soldiers are not only the new nobles of the country, but also the darlings of Shanghai. Those genuine soldiers who fought hard for eight years, on the other hand, are dressed in rags, with yellow faces and thin bodies. No wonder many anti-Japanese soldiers shed tears of pain when they talk about the achievements of the anti-Japanese war.

    上海的三种人
    上海虽是中国的土地，但老早被人称为国际的都市了。在战前中外的大人物及他们的财富大都集中在租界里，于是租界便成了一切精华荟萃之所，因此也形成了世界上独一无二的特殊的地区。胜利后租界总算收回了，但特殊的现象并没有消失，你如果从那些被租借过的街道走过去，那里仍旧是拥满了外国人，耳闻目睹很少有中国气味。这些外国人里最多最活跃的要算美国人了。
    （一）美国兵：美国兵这是我们最要好的盟友，在八年的抗战里帮了我们很多的忙，对这有功于我们的朋友，理应报酬从丰，于是大人先生们的太太小姐们，为了优待盟军，也不妨破例来一次社交公开，借以敦睦“邦交”，美国在这些场合下，也就显得分外“活泼”。但我们毕竟是“落后”国家的人民，对于朋友们的“活泼”，有时实在看不惯。盟军的活跃，在中国各地到处表演，在上海当然不能例外。上海是中国最大的城市，有数不清的街道，上海每一条街道上都可以看见黄呢黑呢衣成群成伙的盟友，和盟友一辆接一辆的吉普车。这些车行驶起来横冲直撞，常常有被撞或辗死人的新闻，虽然后者开行速度有了限制，但撞人的记录并不减少，甚至闻名的作家夏衍、戈宝权两位先生都被撞伤。盟友除吉普车之外，又是三轮车与黄包车的经常主顾，他们坐在车子上，一路开心地“惯响炮”，高声“呵呵”，尤其是少人的地方，表演的更是精彩，每到黄昏以后，上海市各娱乐场、酒场，霓光照耀的如同天堂。盟友嘻嘻哈哈地进去，醉熏熏地出来，东碰西撞，遇见男人餐以拳头，如系女子先以挟揣，继以强上弓式的接吻。懂得盟军心理的人们，说他是“活泼”，但大部分人都认为是瞧不起中国人。大公报三月二十一日登载一个女孩子来函说：“有五六个美国水兵正在前面行走，我坐的车子由他们身边擦过，引起他们的注意，忽然我的车子被一个美兵抓住了，同时他象猛兽一般向我车上跳来，把我身子一把抓住欲行无礼。这种行为，简直是一种莫大的侮辱和歧视，是对于我们中国人民的一种侮辱，人家看不起我们的国家，才对我们人民公然无礼。”事后，魏特梅耶将军为维持美军名誉，说是要“一经查明，决予严惩不贷”，并派员到受侮的女子家里道歉。可是就在这“严惩不贷”表示不久以后，紧接着是四川路又发生美兵行劫和美沙利药房被美兵殴伤等事件，这对盟军当局实在不大光荣。美第七舰队司令柯克将军，接获报告，证实海军人员在本市确有不规行动。从三月二十一日起命令将八艘美舰限期取消，不准上岸，同时美海军宪兵与中国官方充分合作，保证美海军人员不再有非法行为。但是海军人员仍然和从前一样，到处可见，而且继续又有水兵抢劫钻石戒指的事情发生。
    （二）日本人：日本人本是敌国留在上海的人。日本人成了我们的俘虏。作为俘虏的日本人，和横行直撞的美国水兵相较，当然“相形见拙”。可是和我们中国人相比，单从衣服看，要比我们阔绰数倍。据说集中营的俘虏很受优待，这证诸街头，军车上所接触到的日本人，常常表现出一种骄傲的样子。日本人形式上是我们的俘虏，而心理上仍然是我们的主人。我们的宽大为怀是永远感化不了日本俘虏的心，这些俘虏们都在期待着一个翻身的机会。果然机会来了，为了东北问题国外国内起了反苏的浪潮，日本集中营居然欢呼第三次大战起源。日侨自治会并召开紧急会议，宣布：（一）美苏已开火。（二）麦师已下令重新武装日本。（三）前日军司令松井在日俘集中营下令，日俘停止轮送回国。虽然结果是一个空幻，是一种失望，但却给我们一个可贵的暗示：中国如不能团结，如不能走民主道路，日本人的死灰必定要复燃，日本的俘虏就在等待一个卷土重来的机会。本月初，上海日侨管理处，曾举行一次日侨民意测验，结果三五一三○日侨男女都想保留天皇。从这些地方可以看出，我们没有将日本人征服了，我们的宽大无异是“养虎”遗祸，将来要自食其果。
    （三）中国丘八：中国军人称为“丘八”，不知始自何时，按一般人的解释，“丘八”就是代表蛮不讲理。这件事仍到处皆是，无需举例。不过血战八年中，中国军人的英勇作战，吃苦受难，已经改变了从前“丘八”的印象。可是在上海的一部分军人，给人的印象比从前的“丘八”要坏的多。大半暂出伪军应变而来，这从他们的服装上也可找出一些线索，他们从日本人那里接继过来的呢服，马靴，穿戴起来，确乎比正牌军人神气，而他们在上海也比正牌军人吃得开，他们对于欺压老百姓，当然比正牌军人在行，在饭馆里吃饭，不付钱，他们打三轮车，黄包车、捣乱电影剧院。还有他们坐电车不掏钱，当然是奉命的，但是还要不断截电车，打机师。只要领章上有一道金线、一个花的小尉官，一上电车就威风八面，开口骂人，出手打人，成了司空见惯。别的人侧目而视，缄口不言。因为上海人是从日本人手中解放出来的，对于这种作风已领教够了，谁还敢再来多事。于是这些军人不仅是国家的新贵，而且成了上海的宠儿，那些苦战八年的正牌军人，反而衣服破烂，面黄饥瘦，无怪很多抗战军人，说起抗战成绩，而痛心落泪了。（本文系转截济南“华北新闻报”二二二三期）
