　　[Changzhi News from this newspaper] In late May and early June, a few villages in Leftquan, Pingding, Linxian, and Shexian counties suffered hailstorms, resulting in slight damage to the wheat harvest and autumn seedlings. In Donghuangzhang Village, Leftquan, 110 mu of seedlings were damaged, and in the Matian area, over 360 mu of seedlings were damaged, reducing the wheat harvest by half. Around Nanmajiazhuang, Pingding, 200 mu of wheat fields were destroyed. Xishu, Shentou, and Chunshuling in Shexian county have also been hit by disasters successively. In addition to sending personnel to the disaster areas for investigation and relief, local governments have called on the masses to replant. Besides actively replanting, the masses in Matian are also organizing the digging and transportation of medicinal materials and other sideline occupations to offset the losses from the hailstorms.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 13th. Southern counties of Chahar Province are now taking advantage of the post-rain period to carry out emergency replanting. The Chahar Provincial Production Committee, after the rain on the 7th, immediately sent people to the countryside to lead and urge the masses to plant. In Xuanhua, Wanquan, Tianzhen, and other counties, the work of government agencies, organizations, and troops that could be delayed has been suspended. Most of the cadres and livestock have been deployed to help the families of soldiers and the masses who lack labor to rush to plant. Class hours for primary and secondary school students have also been moved to the morning to help with family production. Farmers in the suburbs of Zhangjiakou City are now working day and night to eliminate more than 40,000 mu of dry land. The masses in the paddy field areas have organized mutual aid teams and work teams to help with cultivation. In Xiaoxinzhuang, a medium-sized village with four families and more than 270 hectares of dry land will also be fully cultivated.
