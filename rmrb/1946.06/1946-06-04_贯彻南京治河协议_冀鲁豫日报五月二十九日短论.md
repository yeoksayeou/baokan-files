    Implement the Nanjing River Management Agreement
    Short Commentary from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Daily, May 29th
    The Yellow River issue, which is of utmost concern to the people of the entire region, has, through everyone's efforts and the appeals of our representatives who advocated for the people and argued reasonably with the other side, garnering sympathy from people across the country, finally achieved two Nanjing agreements based on the principle of mutual assistance and concession. This has found a correct solution for the issue of river management and channel change in the future, and we express our approval of this. The people of our liberated areas, in addition to personally practicing it, should also promote the implementation of the Nanjing agreement. Therefore, we would like to put forward the following opinions again, so that the river management issue can be beneficial. (1) We must faithfully implement the Nanjing agreement and resolutely implement its realization. Therefore, we call on the people of the entire border region to urgently mobilize and use all our energy to carry out the project of dike restoration, river dredging, and repairing old channels. Only in this way can we save ourselves; only in this way can we win assistance from all parties; and only in this way can we reduce or even avoid the terrible disaster of the Yellow River flooding. (2) According to the provisions of the agreement, our region should immediately start the project of dike restoration, river dredging, and consolidation of the old Yellow River channel, and the damming project should be carried out simultaneously. Although the agreement clearly stipulates the principle of not causing water damage to the downstream, it is ultimately only a resolution. How to put the resolution on paper into practice in the future depends on the greatest efforts of the people in the liberated areas on the one hand, and on the other hand, it depends on the other side's faithful practice of the agreement, and we must strive for the implementation of the agreement. (3) The restoration of dikes, river dredging, and consolidation of river channels is a very large project. In fact, the embankments that stretch for more than two thousand miles and have not been repaired for many years have become dilapidated, and the riverbeds are full of accumulated sand. It can be estimated that this arduous project cannot be completed in a short period of time. We require that problems be decided based on the actual situation, and problems should not be decided by departing from the facts and starting from other situations, otherwise, the lessons of the facts will prove that it will not work.

    贯彻南京治河协议
    冀鲁豫日报五月二十九日短论
    全区人民万分焦虑之黄河问题，经大家的努力，以及我们的代表奔走呼吁，为民请命，向对方据理力争，收得国内广大人士的同情，终于在互助互让的原则下，获致南京两项协议，这对今后治河改道问题，找到了正确的解决方法，我们对此，表示赞同。我解放区人民，除身体力行外，尚应促使南京协议的贯彻，因此特再提出下列几点意见，使治河问题，有所裨益。（一）我们要忠实执行南京协议，并坚决贯彻协议的实现。因此号召全边区人民，紧急的动员起来，用我们全付精力，进行复堤浚河，修理旧道的工程，只有这样，才能自救；只有这样才能博得各方对我们的援助；也只有这样，才能使自己减少以至免除可怕的黄泛之灾。（二）根据协议的规定，我区应立即开始复堤浚河，整理黄河旧道工程，而对于堵口工程，乃相并进行，协议虽明确规定：不使下游发生水害的原则，但究竟仅是决议，今后如何把纸上的决议付诸实行，一方面要依靠解放区人民最大的努力，另一方面还要看对方对于协议的忠实实践，而我们是要力求协议的贯彻。（三）关于复堤浚河、整理河道，是十分浩大的一项工程，事实上绵延二千余里、年久未修之堤岸，已破烂不堪，河床积沙累累，可以估计此项繁重工程，是不可能在短期内完成的，我们要求根据实际情况决定问题，不能离开事实从其他情况出发等决定问题，否则，事实的教训，会是行不通的。
