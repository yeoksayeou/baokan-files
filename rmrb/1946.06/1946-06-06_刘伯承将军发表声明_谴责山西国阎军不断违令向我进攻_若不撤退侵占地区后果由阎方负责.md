    (Our newspaper, Handan, 3rd dispatch) General Liu Bocheng issued a statement today, condemning the Shanxi Kuomintang army and Yan's army for repeatedly disobeying orders and attacking our Taiyue and Taihang Liberated Areas, warning the warmongering elements in Shanxi: From January 14th to May 31st, the Shanxi Kuomintang army and Yan's army launched more than 156 attacks on our Taiyue and Taihang Liberated Areas, occupying over 90 towns and villages, including Wenxi city. In the area stretching hundreds of miles from Xugou in the north to Xia County in the south, the invading army is continuing its fierce nibbling attacks on us. The fierce siege of our southern Shanxi Jishan, Wanquan, and Hejin Liberated Areas by Yan's 72nd Division, combined with the Kuomintang army's 31st and 167th Divisions, which began on May 16th, has not yet stopped. I have repeatedly protested against this disobedient behavior, hoping to arouse the Yan army's self-awareness. Unexpectedly, the Yan army turned a deaf ear and even intensified its efforts, pressing closer and closer. In order to safeguard the dignity of the ceasefire order and the Sixth Hòa Zì Order, I hereby solemnly declare: If they continue to adhere to the policy of civil war and do not withdraw from the occupied areas, the Yan side will be held fully responsible for all unfortunate events that occur.

    刘伯承将军发表声明
    谴责山西国阎军不断违令向我进攻
    若不撤退侵占地区后果由阎方负责
    〔本报邯郸三日电〕刘伯承将军于今日发表声明，谴责山西国民党军及阎军不断违令向我进攻，警告山西好战分子称：从一月十四日至五月三十一日，山西国民党军及阎军向我太岳、太行解放区进攻达一百五十六次以上。侵占闻喜城以下城镇村庄九十余处。在北起徐沟，南迄夏县长达数百里的地区中，进犯军正继续猛烈向我蚕食进攻，从五月十六日开始的阎军七十二师结合国民党军三十一师、一六七师向我汾南稷山、万泉、河津解放区的猛烈围攻，迄今仍未停止。对此违令行为，我曾屡次提出抗议，冀能引起阎军自觉。孰意阎军竟置若罔闻，甚至变本加厉，步步向我进逼。为维护停战令及和字第六号命令的尊严，余特郑重声明：若彼仍继续坚持内战方针，不从侵占地区撤退，则发生一切不幸事件，概由阎方负其全责。
