Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: A certain official of the Executive Yuan who recently arrived here from Liuzhou spoke of the disaster in Guangxi, saying: From Liuzhou to Wuzhou, starving people are everywhere, and grass roots and tree bark have been dug up and stripped bare. At present, only pear leaves are used to barely sustain life. Even wealthy families can only eat two meager meals of thin porridge a day, and diligent students do not even have enough thin porridge. Currently, food prices are soaring, with rice costing 60,000 legal tender per shi (approximately 133 pounds), and the market for general merchandise has disappeared. On market days, one only sees white-haired old women and young girls traveling together, selling themselves. A young and beautiful woman can be exchanged for one shi of grain (which can be milled into five dou of rice). I saw a mother and daughter embrace and cry bitterly after a sale, a scene of tragic separation, truly heartbreaking.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 29th: The disaster in Hunan is becoming increasingly serious, and hungry people are rising up to loot grain, while the Kuomintang authorities continue to extort military grain. According to the Shanghai News, on the 5th of this month, in one county of Hengyang alone, there were more than 440,000 disaster victims who could not survive without relief. In Leiyang, the wartime provincial capital of Hunan, more than a hundred people have died of starvation or suicide. The disaster victims in Matang, Yueyang, are eating only wild grass. Only two or three out of a hundred families can eat rice, and rice is as precious as pearls, while human flesh is cheaper. Several thousand yuan can buy a young girl, and disaster victims are forming teams to loot grain. In Dapu Township, Hengshan, people escorting grain were surrounded and looted by refugees. The authorities shot and killed hungry people and dissected their abdomens, finding only wild flowers and green grass inside. Within the territory of Wugang County in western Hunan, in Fengshenzhai alone, there are seven or eight hundred hungry people gathering, living by looting. The Wugang County government has temporarily recalled five hundred demobilized soldiers and police to guard against looting by refugees with machine guns. Changde, Taoyuan, Linli, and Shimen counties are focusing on "bandit suppression." Under these circumstances, the Kuomintang authorities are still frantically levying military grain. According to the Shanghai Declaration on the 15th, Changde County alone, after levying nearly 120,000 shi of military grain, was ordered by the Provincial Land and Grain Office to transport 250,000 jin of rice to Zhijiang. When the Fifth Army entered the area, it extorted another 600,000 jin of military grain, with the official price being less than 12,000 yuan per shi (while the general rice price in Hunan Province is 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per shi). Many farmers are forced to throw themselves into the river or sell their children to pay the grain. In places like Shigongqiao and Shanhetan, nineteen out of ten people eat green grass to supply grain to the army.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Guangzhou News: The famine in Guangdong is becoming more and more serious, and the number of hungry people has increased from one million to five million. Zengcheng, Dongguan, Boluo, and other places known as surplus grain areas are now also facing disaster. From Nanjiang, which belongs to Zengcheng, to Shenzhen along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, there are thousands of miles of barren land. From Shilong to Laolong, the riverside vegetation is withered. Along the Dongjiang River, one can wade everywhere, ships are out of service, and Tonghu and Xihu are dry. The drought is severe, and grain prices are soaring, with new records every day. According to the Guangzhou Pioneer Daily, retail polished rice is now selling for 100 yuan per liang, and corn can only be bought for three liang. Ordinary people cannot afford to buy food. There have been many rice looting incidents in Guangzhou City. People in Cangcheng, Gaoan, Huiyang, Kaiping, and Huaxian are carrying baskets to sweep and collect bamboo rice (the fruit formed after bamboo trees bloom) under bamboo trees. In the markets of Huiyang and other places, stalls are even selling bamboo rice for 12,000 yuan per shi. Bamboo rice is very cold and damp, and eating it can cause swelling of the hands and feet and even affect the whole body. If cooked carelessly with honey, leeks, green onions, or chili peppers, it can be fatal. A family of farmers in Yangjiang was poisoned to death by bamboo rice due to careless cooking, but the starving poor have no choice but to drink poison to quench their thirst.

    是谁造成的罪恶！？
    西南各省饿莩载道
    米贵如珠，树皮草根掘食殆尽；人民含泪出卖儿女完军粮
    【新华社延安二十八日电】中央社京讯：新自柳州抵此之行政院某职员谈广西灾情称：自柳州至梧州，饥民载道，草根树皮，挖剥殆尽，目下用以苟延活命者，仅有梨叶。大富之家，亦仅日食稀粥二餐，莘莘学子，稀粥亦无足量。目下粮价高涨，米每市石法币六万元，百货已告无市。赶场之日，仅见白发老婆与少女相偕于途，以人出售，年轻貌美之少妇，可换谷一市担（按可碾米五市斗）。曾见一女成交后，母女相抱痛哭，生离死别，惨绝人寰。
    【新华社淮阴二十九日电】湖南灾情日益严重，饥民纷起劫粮，国民党当局尚继续勒索军粮。据沪新闻报载：本月五日，在衡阳一县，非赈不生的灾民即达四十四万余人。湖南战时省会耒阳，饿死及自杀者达百余人。岳阳麻塘灾民所食均系野草，百家中只有两三家能吃米，而米贵如珠，人肉价格反而便宜，数千元即可买小女一名，灾民纷纷结队抢粮。衡山大堡乡有人押送粮食，难民围聚劫掠，官方击毙饥民，剖腹检验，发现腹内仅有野花青草。湘西武岗县境内，仅风神寨一地，即聚合饥民七八百人，以劫掠为生。武岗县府临时召回退伍军人及警察五百余，以机枪提防饥民劫掠。常德、桃源、临澧、石门各县，正以“剿匪”为中心工作。在此种情况下，国民党当局仍疯狂摊派军粮，据沪申报十五日载，仅常德一县，近于摊派军粮十二万石之后，省田粮处复令县府运米二十五万斤到芷江，第五军入境，又勒索军粮六十万斤，官价每石不到一万二千元（按湘省一般米价，每石四五万元），农民多被迫投河，或卖儿女完粮，石公桥、山河滩等地人民，十九以青草为食，以粮食供应军队。
    【新华社延安二十九日电】广州讯：广东灾荒愈加严重，饥民已由一百万增至五百万人。素称余粮地区之增城、东莞、博罗等地，如今也一片灾象。自增城属之南江以至深圳广九路沿线，赤地千里。由石龙至老隆，沿江草木枯凋。东江沿河，处处皆可步涉，船轮停航，潼湖、西湖均告干涸，旱象甚重，粮价飞涨，日有新记录，据广州前锋日报称：现零售上米，已卖百元一两，玉米也仅可买三两，一般平民都无力购食。广州市内已连续发生抢米事件多起，苍城、高安、惠阳、开平、花县等地人民纷纷携筐往竹树下扫采竹米（竹树开花后所结成之果实），惠阳等地墟市上，甚至摆摊售卖竹米，每石一万二千元。竹米性甚寒湿，食后手足肿胀，甚至影响全身不能行动。煮食时偶一不慎混合蜜糖、韭菜、生葱或辣椒时，有致命之危险。阳江农民一家数口，因煮食不慎，而为竹米所毒毙，但饥饿难熬之贫民，仍不得不饮鸩止渴。
