A Horse's Mouth on a Cow's Head
*Jiefang Ribao* Short Commentary

On the 5th of this month, Peng Xuepei announced at a foreign press conference that the Kuomintang authorities suggested increasing Marshall's final decision-making power as the "most reliable way" to solve the current crisis in China. This means handing over the final decision-making power on the China issue to foreigners, to Marshall. This so-called "suggestion" clearly harms Chinese sovereignty, and also violates the Three-Nation Agreement and Truman's statement of non-interference in China's internal affairs. Therefore, it has been resolutely opposed by the Chinese Communist Party, as well as by many prominent figures and the people of the whole country.

However, Peng Xuepei still insisted on arguing. At the foreign press conference on the 19th, he made a ridiculous statement, saying: "Historically, disputes between major countries have often been submitted to the Hague Tribunal for public arbitration, and the arbitrator is a national of a third country, which does not harm the sovereignty of any independent country." Look at what Peng Xuepei said, it is so irrelevant! Everyone knows that the Hague Tribunal's public arbitration of international disputes falls within the scope of diplomacy, while the China issue is a matter of internal affairs, which is completely different from the Hague Tribunal issue. How can they be mixed up?! The dignified Minister of Propaganda of the Kuomintang is so lacking in common sense, unable to distinguish between internal and external affairs, and still has the nerve to openly rant to foreign reporters, which is really astonishing! But upon careful consideration, this is not accidental. The measures of the Kuomintang authorities are so absurd and shameless that it is impossible to explain them with reason. No matter how good their Minister of Propaganda is at using flowery language to distort the truth, he cannot help but reveal his flaws and make a complete fool of himself everywhere!

　　牛头不对马嘴
    解放日报短评
    本月五日彭学沛在外国记者招待会上，宣布国民党当局建议提高马歇尔的最后决定权，作为解决今天中国时局危机“最可靠的办法”，这就是说，把对于中国问的最后决定权，交给外国人，交给马歇尔。这个所谓“建议”，明明白白是损害中国主权，而且也是违背了三国协定，与杜鲁门声明不干涉中国内政的原则，因此遭到中共方面坚决反对，也遭到许多著名人士和全国人民的反对。
    可是，彭学沛还要强辩，在十九号的外国记者招待会上，他竟来一个可笑的声明说：“历来各大国间的纠纷，往往提请海牙法庭公断，公断法官为第三国人，并无损于任何独立的主权”。请看彭学沛说的话，是多么牛头不对马嘴！海牙法庭公断国际纠纷，谁都知道是属于外交范围的问题，而中国问题是内政问题，和海牙法庭问题完全是两回事，怎么竟胡扯在一起？！堂堂的国民党宣传部长竟如此毫无常识，内外不分，居然还有脸皮公开向外国记者大放厥词，真不能不使人吃惊！但是仔细一想，这也并不是偶然的，国民党当局的措施，是如此悖谬和无耻，本来就不可能用道理来加以解释，不管他们的宣传部长是怎样善于花言巧语颠倒黑白，也不能不到处露出马脚，丑态百出！
