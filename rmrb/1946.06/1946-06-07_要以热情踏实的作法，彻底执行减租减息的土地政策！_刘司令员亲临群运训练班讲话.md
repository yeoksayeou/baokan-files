    To Thoroughly Implement the Land Policy of Rent Reduction and Interest Reduction with Enthusiasm and Practicality!
    Commander Liu Attends the Mass Movement Training Class and Speaks
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] In order to thoroughly implement the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses and creating a solid mass foundation for peaceful and democratic construction in the border region, Commander Liu of the Military Region specially attended the Border Region Mass Movement Training Class on the 1st of this month and gave a speech entitled: "We Must Thoroughly Implement the Land Policy of Rent Reduction and Interest Reduction with Enthusiasm and Practicality."
    First, he listed how the realization of Chairman Mao's correct land policy in various periods is related to the progress of our country's people's liberation cause and its extremely important role, which is enough to prove the correctness of Chairman Mao's brilliant land policy.
    Secondly, he explained the relationship between the people's emancipation movement of rent reduction and interest reduction in our border region during the War of Resistance Against Japan and our victory in the anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines. The results of the struggle with the enemy in the stages of development, retreat, re-development, and even counter-offensive are naturally related to the overall comparison of the enemy's strength in each stage, but the development of the border region was not created to the extent it should have been and was not fully consolidated at the beginning. Especially in the later stage of retreat, we were particularly arduous, which was very important in that the people's emancipation movement of rent reduction and interest reduction in the national self-defense movement was not firmly grasped. The victories in each stage, especially the great victories in combat since the counter-offensive, are a manifestation of the power of the people's emancipation. However, the form of expression is the army's combat, and it must not be regarded as the sole power of the army. Now, to strive for peace, democracy, and unity, and oppose civil war, dictatorship, and division, we must thoroughly implement the instructions of the land policy of rent reduction and interest reduction in order to have guarantees.
    Finally, he mainly emphasized the need to thoroughly implement the instructions of the land policy of rent reduction and interest reduction with an enthusiastic and practical approach. We must believe that under the leadership of the correct line, the ability of workers can be easily developed. We are the servants of the people, with no official airs, and even less of a gift-giving mentality. It is a glorious historical undertaking to carry out the emancipation movement for the people. We intellectuals, especially comrades in the army, have a rare opportunity to be tempered by the great furnace of the mass emancipation movement. The most important thing is to go deep into the masses, humbly learn Chairman Mao's style of investigation and research, understand the instructions of the higher authorities, mobilize the masses, summarize experience, and promote experience. Special emphasis should be placed on the mass line. Only by first coming from the masses can we grasp the policy and go to the masses. It is absolutely forbidden to be flamboyant, impetuous, careless, to take over everything, or to act subjectively, resulting in failure to mobilize the broad masses and instead restricting the mass movement and isolating oneself. We must unite local cadres from the mass line and discover and cultivate local mass leaders in the mass movement. Only in this way can the work take root and establish a permanent and solid democratic foundation. In the rent reduction and interest reduction movement, we must link up with production and carry out the Wu Manyou movement. Now we must ensure that the masses receive wheat and are not robbed by the reactionaries, and that they can completely sow seeds. We must also link up with the people's armed organizations to give them a strong self-defense force. This has been proven in history, especially recently in preventing the Kuomintang reactionaries from attacking us, and especially at a time when the fascist heads are going to the Northeast and North China front to deploy and expand the civil war, this point cannot be ignored.

    要以热情踏实的作法，彻底执行减租减息的土地政策！
    刘司令员亲临群运训练班讲话
    【本报特讯】为彻底贯彻大胆放手发动群众，造成边区和平民主建设雄厚的群众基础，本月一日，军区刘司令员，特亲临边区群运训练班讲话，题为：“我们要以热情的踏实的作法，彻底执行减租减息的土地政策”。
    首先列述毛主席历在各时期正确的土地政策是否被实现，关系于我国人民解放的事业进展与否，作用极大，这足以证明毛主席英明的土地政策之正确。
    其次，说明我们边区在抗战时期减租减息的人民翻身运动与我们敌后抗战胜利的关系。在发展、退缩、复发展以至反攻各阶段与敌人斗争的结果，自然关乎敌我力量在各个阶段总的对比使然，但开始创造边区的发展未到应有的充分与巩固，尤其在以后退缩阶段我们特为艰苦，有关于在民族自卫运动中人民减租减息之翻身运动未抓紧至为重大。各阶段胜利，尤其反攻以来的作战胜利特大，就是人民翻身力量的表现。不过表现的形式是军队作战决不可认为军队单独之力。现在要力争和平、民主、团结，反对内战、独裁、分裂，必须彻底执行减租减息的土地政策之指示，乃能有保障。
    最后，主要的强调要以热情的、踏实的作法去彻底执行减租减息的土地政策之指示。我们要相信在正确路线领导之下，工作者的能力容易展开。我们是人民的勤务员，没有什么官架子，更没有什么恩赐观点。为人民作翻身运动乃光荣的历史事业。我们知识分子尤其是军队的同志，经过群众翻身运动的大洪炉锻炼，乃不可多得的机会。最重要的要深入群众中，去虚心学习毛主席的调查研究的作风，了解上级的指示，发动群众，总结经验，发扬经验。特别着重于群众路线，只有先从群众中来，才能把握政策到群众中去。决不可飞扬浮燥，粗枝大叶，代替包办，主观用事，结果未把广大群众发动起来，反束缚群众运动自己陷于孤立。要从群众路线中团结本地干部，并在群众运动中发现能培养本地群众领袖。如此才能使工作生根，建立永久的坚实的民主基础。在减租减息运动中要联系生产，开展吴满有运动，现在就要使群众收到麦子，不被反动派抢去，并能完全下种。又要连系人民武装组织，使之有壮健的自卫力量。已在历史上证明，尤其最近阻止国民党反动派向我进攻，特别在法西斯头子正往东北与华北前线布置扩大内战之时，这一点不可忽略。
