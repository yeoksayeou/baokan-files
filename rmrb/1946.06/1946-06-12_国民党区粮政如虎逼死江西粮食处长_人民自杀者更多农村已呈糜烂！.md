Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 9th: According to Shanghai newspapers, the Kuomintang authorities are urgently pressing for the collection of military grain from various places to supply the civil war, which has aggravated the famine and led to deaths. Because Jiangxi Province could not collect enough grain, the Ministry of Food telegraphed Jiangxi Grain Director Cheng Maoxing, accusing him of "harming the country." Cheng personally went to various counties to supervise the collection, but because 72 of Jiangxi's 83 counties had been ravaged by the enemy, and western Jiangxi was suffering from drought and epidemics, the people were starving and waiting to die, where could surplus grain come from! Cheng was forced to commit suicide by drowning in the Gan River near Bailuzhou on May 10th. After Cheng's death, Jiangxi Province barely scraped together 500,000 shi (a unit of dry volume). With a shortfall of 1.5 million shi, Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly telegraphed for the collection of grain. The Chairman of Jiangxi Province then said: The grain policy should not be hindered because of Cheng's suicide. Later, Chen Weisheng, a farmer from Zhongxiyanghu Township, fled because he had no grain to pay. The township government sent troops to his home to demand payment. Chen's wife was forced to commit suicide by swallowing hydrochloric acid on May 13th. His son, Chen Guobin, was detained for four days and nights, became ill due to weakness, and died after being released. However, Cheng Maoxing's death as a remonstrance against the evil policy did not prompt the Kuomintang authorities to repent. Due to the heavy taxation and extortion, Qingpu rural area, a land of fish and rice, is already decaying! Currently, the county's military grain quota is 40,000 shi. People have scraped together grain to pay 70%, but the remaining amount must be paid before May 16th, otherwise, the grain stored by each household will be confiscated and dealt with according to the law. Wuxi was ordered to purchase 78,400 shi, and 64,000 shi have already been paid. While the remaining amount has not been cleared, the province ordered to continue purchasing 5,000 shi. In Wuhu, under the pressure of military grain collection, people mostly eat grass roots and tree bark; however, the Anhui Storage and Transportation Office of the Grain Bureau ordered to purchase 10,000 shi. The situation is the same everywhere else. Shanghai Economic Survey pointed out: "The purchase of military grain and the creation of speculative manipulation are important reasons for promoting the deepening of the grain shortage and famine." "If the government's policies do not change, it will only get worse."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 9th: The suicide of Cheng Maoxing, the Grain Director of Jiangxi Province, has aroused public outrage in various places. Shanghai Wenhui Daily's May 27th dispatch said: "Mr. Cheng is dead. People from all walks of life in Jiangxi Province hope that Mr. Cheng's death can serve as a 'death remonstrance' to those who are keen on civil war, telling them that the Chinese people can no longer withstand civil war. Before Mr. Cheng's suicide, I do not know how many farmers were forced to commit suicide because they could not afford to pay 'military grain'. Mr. Cheng's death further shows that Jiangxi really has no military grain!" On the 29th, a reader named Xia Xingfang sent a letter to the newspaper donating 100,000 yuan to comfort Cheng's family. The letter stated: "Such a good official did not serve and die for the country during the War of Resistance Against Japan, but instead made a death remonstrance for the evil policies after the victory, it is truly lamentable!" The editors of Wenhui Daily added a note, calling on readers to actively donate and complete this righteous act. And said: "Today, the inhumanity and lack of conscience of some reactionary politicians is heartbreaking! Just think about how China has gone through eight years of war, the people have suffered displacement, and the country's vitality has been exhausted. Being able to disregard everything and create a civil war shows how terrible their hearts are! Cheng's death shows how far our politics have reached."

    国民党区粮政如虎逼死江西粮食处长
    人民自杀者更多农村已呈糜烂！
    【新华社延安九日电】据沪报消息：国民党当局为供应内战，向各地催征军粮，急如星火，致加重饥荒，逼死人命。赣省因催征无粮，粮部电责江西粮食处长程懋型以“误国”之罪，程氏亲赴各县督征，但以江西八十三县中，七十二县受敌蹂躏，赣西一带又遭旱灾、疫疠，人民饥馑待毙，何来余粮！程被迫于五月十日在赣江河畔白鹭州投水自杀。程氏死后，赣省勉强凑出五十万石。差额一百五十万石，蒋介石却迭电催征，赣主席则说：不能因程自杀而阻挠粮政，其后又有中溪阳湖乡农民陈维声因无粮缴纳出逃，乡公所派兵至其家坐催，陈妻被迫于五月十三日吞盐酸自杀，子陈国斌被拘押四昼夜，体弱成病，释出后即死。但程懋型对恶政之死谏，并不能促使国民党当局悔悟，横征暴敛之故，鱼米之乡，青浦农村，已呈糜烂！目前全县军粮派额四万石，人民罄口凑粮缴七成，然欠额犹限五月十六日前缴清，否则将各户存粮没收，并拘案法办。无锡奉命采购七万八千四百石，已缴六万四千石，欠额未清之际，省方又令续购五千石。芜湖在军粮催征下，人民多以草根树皮为食；然粮食处安徽储运处又令购一万石。其他各地，莫不如此。上海经济一览指出：“征购军粮和造成投机操纵，实为促使粮荒饥荒深刻化的重要原因”，“假使政府施政无所改变，只有再恶化下去”。
    【新华社延安九日电】江西粮食处长程懋型之自杀，引起各地人士公愤。沪文汇报五月二十七日通讯称：“程氏是死了，赣省各界人民，希望程氏之死，能给勇于内战者作为‘死谏’，告诉他们，中国人民是再也经不起内战了。在程氏自杀之前，不知有多少农民因出不起‘军粮’而被迫自杀。程氏之死，更说明江西是实实在在没有军粮了”！二十九日，该报有读者夏行方投函捐赠十万元，抚恤程氏遗族。函中有谓：“如此好官，不在抗战中效忠殉国，而竟为胜利后之恶政作死谏，言之曷胜浩叹！”文汇报编者特加附注，号召读者踊跃输将，完成义举。并谓：“今日一部分反动政治家之灭绝人性，毫无血气，言之只有痛心！只要想想中国经过八年战争，人民受尽流离颠沛，国家元气丧失殆尽之际，能不顾一切制造内战，就知道其心地如何的可怕了！程氏之死，说明我们的政治已经到达如何地步”。
