Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th - Nanjing dispatch: Since April, rice prices in Beijing and Shanghai have skyrocketed. In late May, the price reached over 70,000 (currency not specified) per stone (unit of measure), causing extreme panic among citizens. Shanghai's Wenhui Daily, in an article titled "White Terror," pointed out: "This is a direct reaction to the national government's return to Nanjing and the reorganization of the government, and it is also related to the flight of the newly appointed Minister of National Defense, General Bai Chongxi, to Shenyang and Changchun."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th - Shanghai dispatch: In the past half-month, workers and civil servants in Beijing, Shanghai, Suzhou, and other places have launched a wave of strikes due to unsuccessful requests for improved living standards. Shanghai's British-owned tram workers launched a general strike on the 18th of last month. During the same period, Shanghai Jianghai Customs employees also went on strike, and all employees of the Shanghai Higher Court and District Court also submitted their resignations. Five thousand Shanghai sanitation workers also staged a general strike on the 18th, and on the 19th, each person held a broom and held a large parade. Following the strike by judges of the Supreme Court, all staff of the Nanjing District Court marched to the Ministry of Judicial Administration on the 21st to petition for relief and unanimously stopped working. The entire staff of the Suzhou Higher Court Procuratorate and other departments went on strike. Police officers in Suzhou went on strike on the 20th, and Suzhou county government employees are also considering a strike.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 6th - The disaster in Guangxi is becoming more and more serious. According to a Guilin correspondent report in the Shanghai United Evening News on May 10th: 13 million people in the province are suffering from hunger, of which 3 million are on the verge of death. Due to war disasters, man-made disasters, and natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and insect plagues, disaster areas account for two-thirds of the province's 99 counties, with the most serious being Lingchuan, Baishou, Yongfu, Pingle, Xiuren, Yining, Zhongshan, Guilin, Liucheng, and more than 50 other counties. In northern Guangxi, men, women, old and young, eat bamboo rice and bamboo leaves. In a certain township in Rongxian County, out of 6,000 people in the township, more than 3,000 are starving, and countless people have starved to death. In Luocheng County, last year's harvest was poor, and people survived on tree bark and grass roots. People in Hexian, Lingchuan, and Xiangxian counties eat tree bark, banana heads, and foul-smelling wild plants. In Yongfu County, the number of starving people increased from several hundred in March to more than 16,000 in April. According to a Chengdu correspondent report in the same newspaper: The drought in Sichuan has become extremely serious, with nearly 30 counties reporting disasters. In the northern Sichuan area, there has been a long drought without rain, and nine-tenths of the barley crop has been lost, and six-tenths of the wheat crop has been lost. Other foods such as rapeseed and spinach have also suffered heavy losses, making spring planting hopeless and summer planting worrying. Currently, people are picking tree roots and wild fruits for food.
