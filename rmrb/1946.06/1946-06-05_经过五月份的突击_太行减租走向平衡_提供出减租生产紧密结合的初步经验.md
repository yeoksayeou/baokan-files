    After the May Blitz
    The Rent Reduction in Taihang Moves Towards Balance
    Providing Preliminary Experience in Closely Integrating Rent Reduction with Production
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] The Taihang rent reduction movement, after the May blitz, has now moved towards balance throughout the region. The development of the movement can currently be divided into four types of areas: 1. Areas that have shifted to focusing on the large-scale production movement, resolving remaining issues from the mass movement within production, including seven counties: Changzhi, Lucheng, Huguan, Xiangyuan, Xiyang, Heshun, and Wu'an. 2. Areas beginning to shift towards production, including four counties: Pingding, Linxian, Lingchuan, and Anyang. 3. Areas currently deepening the rent reduction and other movements, including nine counties: Shahe, Xingtai, Neiqiu, Lincheng, Shouyang, Yuci, Taigu, Qixian, and Cixian. 4. Areas where the movement is moving towards a climax, including thirteen counties: Zanhuang, Gaoyi, Huolu, Yuanshi, Jingxing, Huixian, Jiqi, Tangyin, Xiuwu, Wuzhi, Wenxian, Qinyang, and Bo'ai. In addition, the old areas of Wuxiang, Yushe, Zuoquan, and Xingxi are also nearing the end of their investigation and rent reduction. Over the past month, the movement has shown three characteristics: (1) The close integration of rent reduction and production. All areas have grasped the principle of "neither hindering production because of rent reduction, nor relaxing rent reduction because of production." For example, the main experiences provided by Hengshan in Xiyang and Baihe in Wuxiang are: A. Unified leadership of production and rent reduction. Based on mutual aid teams, problems are brewed and discovered during labor in the daytime, and problems are solved during rest, meals, at night, and during rainy days. B. Adopt irregular gatherings in people's schools to solve major problems, while small problems are solved by groups. (2) The vigorous production movement has tested the degree of rent reduction and further promoted the deepening of the movement. In organizing mutual aid, it was found that due to improper resolution of problems between farmers during the in-depth movement, the phenomenon of fearing wealth and not being enthusiastic about production occurred. However, after publicizing that rent reduction is against feudal exploitation, not against getting rich, and that "learning from Wu Manyou and getting rich through labor is the most glorious," the problems between farmers were also properly resolved, and the farmers' enthusiasm for production greatly increased. (3) The rapid and reasonable distribution of the fruits of struggle is the key to closely linking cadres with the masses and deepening the movement and developing production. In many places, improper distribution of the fruits of struggle has led to disunity between cadres and the masses, which has facilitated the enemy's sabotage and the landlord's counter-attack. After self-criticism by village cadres in counties such as Heshun, Gaoyi, and Wu'an, they returned the excess they had received to the masses, the relationship was immediately improved, and the movement moved forward. The main reason why the movement in the entire region could be universally and rapidly carried out in the past month is that the leadership in various places has continued to implement the policy of boldly letting go, timely breaking down the obstacles to the progress of the movement, overcoming paternalism, and using the working style of consulting with the masses more. Currently, all areas are making a blitz on the summer harvest. Between the wheat harvest and the autumn harvest, rent reduction will be implemented in conjunction with production, and investigation and rent reduction will be carried out.

    经过五月份的突击
    太行减租走向平衡
    提供出减租生产紧密结合的初步经验
    【本报长治讯】太行减租运动，经过五月的突击，全区现已走上平衡，运动发展，目前可分四种地区：一、已转入以大生产运动为主，在生产中解决群运遗留问题的，有长治、潞城、壶关、襄垣、昔阳、和顺、武安等七县。二、开始转向生产的，有平定、林县、陵川、安阳等四县。三、正在深入减租等运动的，有沙河、邢台、内邱、临城、寿阳、榆次、太谷、祁县、磁县等九县。四、运动正走向高涨的，有赞皇、高邑、获鹿、元氏、井陉、辉县、汲淇、汤阴、修武、武陟、温县、沁阳、博爱等十三县。此外，武乡、榆社、左权、邢西等老区，查减亦正结束。一月来，运动表现着三个特点：（一）减租与生产的紧密结合，各地都掌握了“既不因减租妨害生产，又不因生产而放松减租”的原则。如昔阳横山、武乡白河等地提供的主要经验是：甲、生产与减租统一领导。以互助组为基础，白天在劳动中酝酿和发现问题，休息、吃饭、夜间、雨天等空闲时间解决问题。乙、采取不定期的在民校集合，解决大问题，小问题则由小组解决。（二）蓬勃的生产运动，考验了减租的程度，又促进了运动的进一步深入。在组织互助中，均发现有因深入运动时，农民相互间的问题解决不适当，以致发生怕发家思想，与生产不起劲现象，但在宣传了减租是反对封建剥削，不是反对发财，“学习吴满有、劳动发家最光荣”等，农民之间的问题也得到适当解决之后，农民生产劲头便大起来。（三）迅速合理分配斗争果实，是密切干部与群众关系，深入运动与开展生产的关键。许多地方由于斗争果实分配不当，引起干部群众不团结，便利了特务的乘机破坏与地主反攻。和顺、高邑、武安等县村干部自我检讨后，把自己多分的退给群众，关系立即改善，运动也就前进一步。一月来，全区运动能够普遍迅速开展的主要原因，则是各地领导上继续贯彻了大胆放手的方针，及时打破了运动前进的障碍，克服了包办代替，运用了多与群众商量的工作作风，现各地正在突击夏收，在麦收到秋收之间，再结合生产贯彻减租，进行查减。
