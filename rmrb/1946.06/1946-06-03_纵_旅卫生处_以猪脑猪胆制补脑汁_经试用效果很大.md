Makes Brain-Boosting Juice with Pig Brain and Pig Bile
With Great Results After Trial Use
[This Dispatch from Heze] The × Column ×× Brigade Health Office has made a brain-boosting juice with pig brain and pig bile, and the results after experimentation are very significant. The method of preparation, administration, indications, and experimental results are published below, hoping that medical comrades in the entire border area will pay attention to research. (1) Preparation Method: For every pound, use one fresh pig brain (about 100 grams) and two pig galls (about 50 grams). It can be mixed with stomach-strengthening and tonic agents to make a light yellow liquid with a slightly bitter, sweet, and fragrant taste. Administration and Dosage: Take 10 to 15 grams half an hour after each meal, three to four times a day. Indications: Neurasthenia, headache, nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, impotence, decreased energy, night blindness, jaundice, insomnia, loss of appetite, etc. Contraindications: Acids, fruits, and tea. Experimental Results: Comrade Xu Boliang suffered from headaches, insomnia, neurasthenia, nocturnal emission, and poor memory. He would get a headache after reading for half an hour. After taking the medicine for eight days, he could persist in reading for eight hours a day without feeling a headache. Nocturnal emission and insomnia have also not occurred. Comrade Dong Chuanzhang suffered from spermatorrhea and headaches. Every time he exerted himself or had a bowel movement, semen would flow out in his urine, and he had nocturnal emissions every night. The headaches were very severe. For the first two days of taking the medicine, the spermatorrhea was more severe, but it lessened on the third day. From the first day until now, it has been more than ten days, and no nocturnal emissions have been discovered, and the headaches have also slightly lessened (currently continuing to take the medicine). There are still many comrades currently taking the medicine, and they all say it is effective. Because it is still early in the course of administration, no conclusions have been reached. It is hoped that all medical comrades will continue to research and experiment. This medicine was tested in Yan'an for several months, and the results were similar. If continued experimentation can be carried out, better results may be obtained.

    【本报荷泽讯】×纵队××旅卫生处，以猪脑和猪胆制成补脑汁，经实验后，效果很大。兹将其制法、服法、适应症，实验效果发表于后，希全边区医务同志注意研究。（一）制法——每磅中用新鲜猪脑一个（约一百克），猪胆两个（约五十克），可和以健胃强壮剂，制成淡黄色液体，味微苦、甘香。服法及用量，每饭后半小时服十至十五克，每日服三四次。适应症，神经衰弱、头痛、遗精、精漏、阳萎、精力减退、夜盲、黄胆、失眠、食欲不振等，禁忌酸类、果类及茶水。实验效果：徐伯亮同志头痛，失眠，神经衰弱，遗精，记忆力弱，看半小时书即头痛，经服药八天后，每日看书能坚持八小时，并不觉头痛，遗精，失眠，亦未犯过。董传章同志漏精，头痛，每逢用力或大便时，小便中即流出精液，每晚都要遗精，头痛非常严重，服药前两天漏精较重，第三天即见轻，由第一天至今已十几天之久，未发现遗精的毛病、头痛亦稍见轻（现继续服用）。现在还有很多同志正在服用中，都说有效。因初服不久，还未得出结论。希各医生同志继续研究试验。此药曾在延安试验数月，效果亦如此，如能继续试验，可能得出更好的结果。
