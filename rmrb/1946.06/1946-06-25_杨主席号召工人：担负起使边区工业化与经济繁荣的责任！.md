　　Chairman Yang Calls on Workers:
    Take Responsibility for Industrializing and Prospering the Border Region!
    [Another Dispatch] The Second Enlarged Executive Committee Meeting of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Federation of Trade Unions solemnly concluded on the 20th at the No. 2 Elementary School in Handan City. Minister Nie of the Central Bureau's Civil Affairs Department emphasized in his speech that in the liberated areas, all workers must resolutely implement the policy of labor-capital cooperation, mutual labor-capital assistance, and mutual benefit for labor and capital. This is the only way for the Chinese Communist Party to lead China towards industrialization. He called on all workers to do everything to develop production, transform the liberated areas into industrial zones, and strive for victory in peaceful construction! Subsequently, Chairman Yang, on behalf of the government, paid tribute to the executive committee members and representatives who participated in the formulation of the historically significant resolutions and declarations of the conference. He also highly praised the heroic struggles of the border region workers in defending mines and factories and organizing underground armies during the counter-offensive war. He said: To strive for national independence and freedom, industrialization is the only economic path. The responsibility for first industrializing and economically prospering the border region falls on the shoulders of our worker comrades. Old worker Fang Zhengqi said when talking about implementing the new policy: The old government lightly imprisoned our workers, and heavily executed them. During the Great Revolution, I personally witnessed 19 workers being shot at Changxindian for demanding wage increases. The government of the liberated area is the people's own government, guaranteeing the lives of workers and enabling capitalists to also make money. Labor-capital cooperation to develop industry is very reasonable. We, these executive committee members and representatives, will take this new spirit back, implement it, and unite the 400,000 workers in the border region to thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's policy. Finally, Executive Committee member Zhao Guoqiang pointed to a slogan from the conference with extreme excitement as the end of his speech: "Following Chairman Mao's line is always correct and always victorious."

　　杨主席号召工人：
    担负起使边区工业化与经济繁荣的责任！
    【又讯】晋冀鲁豫边区职工总会第二届第二次执委扩大会议，于二十日在邯郸市二完小隆重举行闭幕式，中共中央局民运部聂部长讲话中强调指出：在解放区，全体职工要坚决执行劳资合作，劳资互助、劳资两利的政策，这是中国共产党领导中国走向工业化的唯一办法。并号召全体职工一切为了发展生产，把解放区变成工业区，争取和平建设的胜利！继由杨主席代表政府向参与大会制定富有历史意义的决议案及宣言的诸执委与代表致敬；并盛赞边区工人在反攻战争中保卫矿山、工厂，与组织地下军的英勇斗争。他说：要争取国家独立自由，在经济上只有工业化一途，首先使边区工业化、经济繁荣的责任就落在工人同志身上。老工人方政奇同志谈到执行新方针时说：旧政府对我们工人轻则监禁，重则枪毙，大革命时我亲眼见到长辛店工人要求增资，一次被枪毙十九个。解放区政府是人民自己的政府，保障工人生活，使资本家也能赚上钱，劳资合作发展工业是很合理的，我们这些执委、代表把这个新的精神带回去，贯彻下去，使边区四十万工人都团结起来，彻底执行毛主席这个方针。最后，执委赵国强同志以极度兴奋的心情指着大会的一条标语作为他谈话的结束语：“跟着毛主席的路线走，永远是正确的，永远是胜利的。”
