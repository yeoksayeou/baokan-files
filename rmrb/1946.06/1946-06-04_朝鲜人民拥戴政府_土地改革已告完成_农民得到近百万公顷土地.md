Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, May 31st: Seoul dispatch: The North Korean People's Autonomous Government, elected on the basis of universal and equal voting, has been growing and consolidating day by day, and has won the support of the expanded people of Korea. The central body of the North Korean regime is the North Korean Provisional People's Committee, established on February 9th at the congress of representatives of various democratic parties, public organizations, provinces, and district people's committees. At the meeting, Kim Il-sung, a hero of the national liberation movement, was unanimously elected as chairman of the government, and Kim Tu-bong as vice-chairman. The congress also drafted an emergency action program, including land reform, restoration of industry and transportation, reorganization of the education system, and explaining the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference's decision on Korea as "the most just and in line with the vital interests of the Korean people." The program also urged the resolute elimination of pro-Japanese elements. In the past few days, the Provisional People's Committee has made great progress in implementing this program. The committee has taken many measures to restore the economy and improve the people's lives. Large factories and mines have been put into operation, and many small and medium-sized enterprises have begun work. Reasonable food rationing and wage standards have been established based on the skill level of workers and the differences in production sectors, and an eight-hour work system has been implemented. School, judicial, and other democratic reforms are underway. Land reform has been completed, enabling landless peasants and poor farmers to obtain 963,657 hectares of land. At farmers' meetings in many cities, farmers spoke with tears of joy, saying, "We believe that when the Red Army came, it would return the land to its true owners." They also thanked the People's Committee, which represents the interests of the people.
