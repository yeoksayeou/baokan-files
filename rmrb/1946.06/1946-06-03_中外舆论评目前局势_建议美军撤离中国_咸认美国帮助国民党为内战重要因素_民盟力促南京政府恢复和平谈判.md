Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, May 31st: Moscow Radio broadcast on the 30th: Masinu's comments on the Chinese and foreign newspapers' reviews of the current situation in China stated that when analyzing the factors that led to the expansion of the civil war in the Northeast, Chinese and foreign newspapers all pointed out that American aid to the Kuomintang was one of the most important factors. All newspapers pointed out that the Kuomintang would not have been able to carry out such a large-scale civil war before, and now it is relying on American help. British London Radio once said that American troops were cooperating with Japanese troops on many transportation lines to help the Kuomintang army attack. An American reporter reported that the so-called American aid to China in disarming Japanese troops and sending Japanese troops back to their country was actually using warships and airplanes to transport Kuomintang troops, while the Japanese troops were used to protect transportation. In North China, six-sevenths of the Japanese troops still completely retained their weapons. An American Weekly News reporter reported that the Kuomintang army, under American cover, advanced along the Beining Railway and carried out a large-scale civil war in Manchuria. For this purpose, the U.S. Marine Corps were stationed along the Beining Railway and in northern Hebei.

    Chinese newspapers have resolutely demanded an end to the civil war and an end to American interference in China's civil war. Many newspapers declared that American aid is an insult to the Chinese nation and a national humiliation for China. Shanghai Wenhui Bao said: It is shameful that we cannot solve our own domestic problems, and it is even more shameful that we cannot implement the agreements that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have reached.

    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, May 31st: According to a United Press Shanghai report on the 30th, the Democratic League is in Nanjing demanding that the Kuomintang immediately resume peace talks. The League denounced the Kuomintang's intention to prolong the civil war by attacking Harbin, Qiqihar and other parts of the Northeast. The League suggested that the United States withdraw its troops and stop helping one side by transporting troops and military supplies.

    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, May 31st: Moscow Radio broadcast on the 30th commented that for the first time in twenty years, the Kuomintang authorities extended invitations to two non-Kuomintang figures, Wang Yunwu (Minister of Economic Affairs) and Yu Dawei (Minister of Communications), to participate in the government. However, everyone knows that both of them are close to the Kuomintang ruling authorities. Therefore, the Kuomintang's request for them to join the government is just a trick, the purpose of which is to create an impression that the resolution of reorganizing the government on a democratic basis according to the Political Consultative Conference has been implemented.

    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, May 30th: Beiping News: Zhang Dongsun, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Democratic League, recently delivered a speech on the inseparability of democracy and peace at a symposium held by the Ping City National Congress Election Promotion Association. Zhang Dongsun loudly appealed: "There must be peace for democracy, and the implementation of democracy will guarantee peace." Zhang then pointed out: "Today, there is a group of soldiers in the Kuomintang who made their fortunes by fighting the civil war. They cannot find a way out except by fighting the civil war. Now the crisis of a full-scale civil war is extremely serious. If it is not stopped immediately, it may cause a civil war from outside the customs to inside the customs, which is extremely unfavorable to the people. Not only will there be sacrifices on the front line, but national prices will rise even higher, and people will not be able to live. Transportation cannot be restored, and business cannot be done. Special agents will use more terrorist means to suppress the people's democratic movement. All over the country, people are being arrested, soldiers are being drafted, and the army is being expanded and sent to the front line as cannon fodder, so the people will not be able to live. Since we are fighting a civil war, the government cannot be reorganized, the National Congress cannot be held, and even if the constitution and other drafts are produced, they will have to be shelved there, and the country will become more and more chaotic."

    中外舆论评目前局势
    建议美军撤离中国
    咸认美国帮助国民党为内战重要因素
    民盟力促南京政府恢复和平谈判
    【新华社延安三十一日电】莫斯科三十日广播：马西努论中外报纸对中国现状的评论称：中外报纸在分析东北内战所以扩大的因素时，都指出美国帮助国民党，是最重要的因素之一。各报都指出国民党以前没有可能实现这样大规模的内战，现在是凭着美国人的帮助。英国伦敦广播曾说：美军在许多交通线上，与日军合作帮助国民党军队进攻。一位美国记者报导：美国所谓帮助中国解除日军武装，遣送日军回国，实际上是用军舰与飞机转运国民党军队，而日军则用于保护交通，在华北，日军尚有七分之六完全保存自己的武装。美国每周新闻记者报导：国民党军在美国掩护之下，沿北宁路前进，在满洲进行大规模的内战。美国海军陆战队为此目的，在北宁路沿线与河北北部驻守各地。
    中国报纸都坚决要求停止内战，停止美国干涉中国内战。许多报纸声言，美国的帮助是对中国民族的侮辱，是中国的国耻。上海文汇报说：我们自己不能解决本国问题是可耻的，我们对于国共两党所已达到的协定，不能付诸实行是更可耻的。
    【新华社延安三十一日电】据合众社上海三十日报导称：民主同盟正在南京要求国民党立即恢复和平谈判。该同盟斥责国民党进攻哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔及东北其他各地延长内战的意图。该同盟建议美国撤退其军队，停止以运输军队及军用品之办法帮助单方面。
    【新华社延安三十一日电】莫斯科三十日广播评称：国民党当局二十年内，第一次延用两名非国民党人士王云五（经济部长）及俞大维（交通部长）参加政府，可是大家都知道，他们两人都是接近国民党执政当局，因此国民党要求他们加入政府，不过是一种手腕，其目的在造成一种印象，似乎政协决议在民主基础上改组政府的决议，已在实行。
    【新华社延安三十日电】北平讯：民盟中央常委张东荪氏，近在平市国大选举协进会召开之座谈会中，发表民主和平不可分的演说，张氏大声疾呼：“必须和平才有民主，实行民主，和平才有保障”。张氏继即指出：“今天国民党内有一批军人，他们是靠打内战起家的，除了打内战，他们找不到一点出路。现在全面内战危机十分严重，不急起制止，有可能自关外引起关内之内战，对人民是极端不利的。不仅前线有牺牲，全国物价将更加高涨，人民无法活下去，交通不能恢复，生意没法做；特务将更加以恐怖手段，镇压人民民主运动；各地抓人抽丁扩大军队，送到前线当炮灰，人民因此更无法活下去了。既然打内战，政府就没法改组，国大也开不成，宪法等案就是弄出来也得搁在那里，国家将越闹越糟”。
