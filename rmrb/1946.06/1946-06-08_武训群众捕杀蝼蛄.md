    Wu Xun Masses Capture and Kill Mole Crickets
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Wei County] A large number of mole crickets have recently been discovered in the first and third districts of Wu Xun, severely damaging wheat seedlings and spring crops. One of the reasons for the mole cricket outbreak is the eight years of enemy-caused disasters, which led to the large-scale abandonment of land, and the failure to thoroughly cultivate the land this year. At present, the democratic government is fully organizing the people, both capturing the mole crickets and weeding the fields. Damaged areas are being replanted immediately, and special attention is being paid to widely planting crops that mole crickets do not eat (such as beans, hemp, etc.).

    武训群众捕杀蝼蛄
    【本报威县讯】武训一、三、区顷发现大批蝼蛄，咬坏麦苗春苗甚多。蝼蛄产生的一个原因，是八年来敌人灾害，致使土地大批荒芜，今年土地又未能熟耕所致。目前民主政府，正以全力组织人民，一面捕捉一面锄草，已受害的立即进行补种，并特别注意广补一种蝼蛄不吃的庄稼（如豆子、麻等）。
