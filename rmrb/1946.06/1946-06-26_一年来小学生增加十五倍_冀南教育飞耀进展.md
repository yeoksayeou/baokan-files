Primary School Students Increase Fifteenfold in One Year
Leaping Progress in Education in Southern Hebei
Experiences at the Regional Education Conference prove that schools can only be run well by following the mass line and serving the masses.
Teach what is needed, learn what is done.
Promote democracy, patiently guide.

[Report from Weixian by this newspaper] The first education conference of the Southern Hebei District, which opened on the 5th of this month and lasted for four weeks, has now successfully concluded. The conference was attended by the heads of the education sections from five special districts and nine counties, including Weixian, Daming, and Hengshui. Director Pang Chaozhe of the Education Department of the Border Region Government also attended to provide guidance. The central purpose of the conference was to summarize achievements, exchange experiences, and discuss issues such as education funding, school system curriculum, and teacher training. During the preparatory meeting, Director Chao elaborated on the new education policy and pointed out two key points: (1) break through the old education system, clarify and establish revolutionary education ideology, and build a new education system that serves the people; (2) at present, the reactionaries are actively provoking a full-scale civil war, and education cadres in the entire region should maintain and promote the excellent style of hard work in order to strive for the real realization of a peaceful situation. Thanks to the development of mass movements and the emancipation of the broad masses over the past year, the number of schools and students in the region has surged. According to incomplete statistics, the region now has a total of 9,272 schools at all levels, including one Construction Academy, one Art School, one Normal School, six middle schools (five public, one private), 164 complete primary schools, and 9,099 junior primary schools. There are a total of 12,412 teachers and staff in schools at all levels (including 899 female teachers). The total number of students in the region is 636,253 (including 133,272 female students). According to a survey of five villages in Daming and Feixiang, before the enemy surrendered last summer, there were a total of 3,933 junior primary school students, but now there are 59,499, an increase of nearly fifteenfold. The proportion of school-age children enrolled in schools in each special district ranges from 65% to 86.5%, and in individual counties such as Weixian, it reaches 93.2%. In addition, the region has a total of 183,133 male and female students in winter schools.

Over the past year, the entire region has largely implemented the new education policy correctly, combining education with society and family. In terms of teaching content, whatever is needed is taught, and whatever is done is learned, without being limited to dead textbooks. In terms of teaching methods, heuristic self-study has been implemented through group teaching, the "little teacher" system, and mutual assistance and learning. In terms of management, democratic awareness is promoted, and the masses are educated through the masses.

Regarding the establishment of schools, three experiences were drawn from the typical introductions of Longping and Xiqingwan: 1. Start by organizing and helping the masses in their lives, and solving their specific difficulties, so that learning and production are closely integrated. 2. Teachers must establish a determination to serve the masses and not be afraid of setbacks. 3. The masses must truly become the masters of the school, and the school must listen to the opinions of the masses and accept the supervision of the masses.

Regarding the connection between schools and local work, the experience of Guanxian is that the county and district organizations of the education committee clearly stipulate that when Party, government, civilian, and military cadres go to the village, they must talk to the teachers about the current work. Village cadres' daily study and the village teachers are incorporated into a group. District and village cadre meetings arrange for inspection work and general current affairs reports, and teachers are invited to participate. At the same time, the central work is arranged for village cadres and teachers. Education village cadres and teachers actively cooperate in their work. Teachers participate in the village judicial committee to mediate disputes. Therefore, teachers have played a driving role in mass movements and other local central work, and their social status has also been improved.

Regarding the democratic management of students, after the abolition of corporal punishment, a correct path has been found through general exploration. Liu Runqiu, the section chief of the Fourth Special District, summarized several experiences: 1. Give more rewards and less criticism. For bad students, first understand their environment and reasons, and gradually transform them through moving them. 2. First promote their advantages, then criticize and overcome their shortcomings. Give indirect enlightenment to their shortcomings and mistakes from the side, and avoid direct criticism in public. 3. To reform old students, teachers, families, and student masses must work together. 4. Try to promote the students' spirit of self-government as much as possible, and teachers should not interfere directly. Everyone unanimously believes that from many typical introductions, a truth has been seen, namely: the concept of serving the masses, solving the practical problems of the masses based on the willingness and needs of the masses, implementing the mass line, promoting democracy, and continuously enlightening and improving the masses are the main factors for the success of new education work.

　　一年来小学生增加十五倍
    冀南教育飞耀进展
    全区教育会议中经验证明，只有走群众路线，服务群众，才能办好学校。
    要啥教啥，干啥学啥  发扬民主，耐心诱导
    【本报威县讯】冀南区第一次教育会议，自本月五日开幕，历时四周，现已圆满闭幕。这次会议有五个专署及威县、大名、衡水等九县的教育科长出席，边府教育庞晁哲甫厅长等亦莅会指导，会议中心目的为总结成绩，交流经验，并商决教育经费、学制课程及培植师资等问题。举行预备会时，晁厅长对新教育方针作了阐述，并指示两点：（一）冲破旧的一套教育制度，明确与树立革命教育思想，建设为人民服务的新教育。（二）目前反动派积极挑动全面内战，全区的教育干部应保持并发扬艰苦的优良作风，以争取各平局面的真正实现。一年来由于群众运动开展，广大群众翻身，使全区学校及学生数目激增，据不完全统计，全区现有各级学校共九千二百七十二所，建国学院、艺术学校、师范学校各一所，中学六所，（公立五所，私立一所）完小一百六十四所，初小九千○九十九所。各级学校教职员共共一万二千四百一十二人，（内女教员八百九十九人）。全区学生共六十三万六十二百五十三人，（内女生一十三万三千二七十二人。）据大名肥乡等五个村的调查统计，去夏敌人投降前，共有初小学生三千九百三十三人，现在则为五万九千四百九十九人，增加了将近十五倍。各专区入学儿童占学龄儿童的百分之六十五占九至百分之八十六点五，个别县份如威县则达百分之九十三点二。此外全区多冬学共有男女学员一十八万三千一百三十三人。
    一年来全区大都正确的执行了新教育方针，教育结合了社会和家庭。在教学内容上是需要什么就教什么，做什么就学什么，不局限于死的课本范围内。在教学方法上，启发自学实行了分组教学的小先生制及互助互学制。在管理上，发扬民主自觉，通过群众来教育群众。
    关于创办学校、从隆平西青湾等典型介绍中，得出三点经验：一、要从组织帮助群众生活，解决其具体困难着手，使学习和生产密切结合起来。二、教员必须确立为群众服务，和不怕碰钉子的决心。三、使群众真正成为学校的主人，学校必须听取群众的意见接受群众的监督。
    关于学校和地方工作的联系，冠县的经验是，县区组织教育委员会明确规定：党政民武干部到村时必须找教员谈目前工作、村干日常学习与本村教员编入一组，区干村干会议布置检村工作及一般时事报告会，均请教员参加，同时向村干及教员布置中心工作、教育村干部与教员主动的配合工作，教员参加村司法委员会，调解纠纷。因此教员在群运及其他地方中心工作中，起了推动作用，其社会地位也提高了。
    对学生的民主管理，在废除体罚后，经过一般摸索，已找到了正确的道路。四专署刘润秋科长总结出几点经验：一、多奖励少批评，对坏学生先了解其环境和原因，逐渐从感动中进行改造。二、先发扬其优点，后批评与克服其缺点。对其缺点与错误从侧面作间接的启发，避免当众直接批评。三、改造旧学生，必须教师、家庭，学生群众三方面同时进行。四、尽量发扬学生的自治精神，教师不作直接干涉。大家一致认为，从许多典型介绍中，看到了一个真理，即：为群众服务的观点，根据群众自愿与需要解决群众的切身问题，贯彻群众路线，发扬民主，不断启发和提高群众，是新教育工作成功的主要因素。          （吴＠）
