    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Rangoon Dispatch: Under the leadership of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, a mass demonstration of 50,000 people was held in Rangoon on the 7th. The people shouted, "We demand complete independence, we don't want a Governor!" and protested against the British government's increasingly intensified high-pressure policies, as well as the recent incident in Tantabin where police shot and killed demonstrators. The Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League also issued a call, demanding that the Burmese "Volunteer Army" mobilize and prepare to meet the coming imperialist suppression.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: London Dispatch: The British House of Commons debated the increasingly tense situation in Burma on the 7th. Communist and progressive Labor Party members of Parliament demanded that the wishes of the Burmese for independence be met, and that the Burmese "Volunteer Army" be recognized as the backbone of the Burmese army, in order to eliminate the tense situation there. Conservative MP Anson strongly opposed this proposal. He expressed fear of the Burmese "Volunteer Army," which had "nine thousand troops," believing it to be a great threat to British rule. He demanded that the government "immediately" implement suppression of the army and the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League. The Minister for Indian and Burmese Affairs, Anderson, in reporting on the policy toward Burma, declared that the British authorities "have taken emergency measures to restore order in Burma," and rejected the suggestions of Communist and progressive Labor Party members of Parliament. This declaration shows that the British authorities' policy toward Burma is no different from that of the Conservative Party. While pursuing a policy of suppression, the Conservative Party is urging the government to simultaneously pursue a policy of appeasement in order to divide the Burmese independence movement and win over the compromise of upper-class elements.

    缅人反对英国高压政策
    仰光五万群众示威
    英共力主予缅甸独立
    【新华社延安十日电】仰光讯：在缅甸人民反法西斯自由联盟领导之下，仰光七日举行五万人的大示威，民众高呼：“我们要求完全独立，我们不要总督”！并抗议英政府日益加强的高压政策，以及最近在坦塔宾发生的警察射杀示威者事件。反法西斯自由联盟并发出号召，要求缅甸“志愿军”动员起来，准备迎接行将来临的帝国主义镇压。
    【新华社延安十日电】伦敦讯：英下院于七日辩论日趋紧张的缅甸情形，共产党及工党进步议员要求满足缅甸独立愿望，承认缅甸“志愿军”为缅甸军的基干，以此消＠该地之紧张情势。保守党议员安森强烈反对此议，他对拥有“九千之众”的缅甸“志愿军”发生恐惧，认为是对英统治的极大威胁。他要求政府对该军及反法西斯自由联盟，“立即”施行镇压。印缅事务大臣安德逊在报告对缅政策时，宣告英当局“已采取紧急措施，以恢复缅甸之秩序”，并拒绝共产党与进步工党议员的建议。此宣告表明英国当局对缅甸采取的政策与保守党无异。与镇压政策同时，保守党正敦促政府兼行怀柔政策，以分化缅甸独立运动，争取上层分子的妥协。
