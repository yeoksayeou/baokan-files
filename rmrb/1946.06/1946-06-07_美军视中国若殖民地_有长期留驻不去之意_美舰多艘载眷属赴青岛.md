Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 4th: The Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference communiqué last winter stipulated that Soviet and American troops should withdraw from China in the shortest possible time. Now, Soviet troops have completely withdrawn from the Northeast, but the U.S. military seems to regard China as a colony, intending to stay for a long time. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Shanghai on the 3rd, Lieutenant General Gillem (formerly translated as Jilun, hereafter using the current name), commander of the U.S. forces in China, stated in an interview with reporters: "The U.S. military headquarters in China will not be dissolved at the end of June this year, but its scope will be reduced as much as possible and will change with the environment. In the near future, there will be no major changes in the U.S. military headquarters, and in the second half of the year, the number of personnel in the U.S. military headquarters will be around 4,000." He also said: "The U.S. Department of the Army has already begun preparations to transport the families of U.S. military personnel stationed in China to China, with the first batch expected to arrive in September this year. The U.S. military authorities are planning in detail the housing and children's education issues for the families of U.S. military personnel arriving in China."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 4th: As Chiang's troops expand the civil war in the Northeast, multiple U.S. warships are heading to Qingdao again and will be stationed there for a long time. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Qingdao on the 2nd, "Several U.S. ships will successively sail to Qingdao this month, and the families of officers from various ships will also go to Qingdao." The local Kuomintang authorities have already allocated 80 enemy and puppet properties that had been seized, as their residences, and they are currently being repaired and arranged. The Seventh Fleet headquarters may move to Qingdao.

    【新华社延安四日电】当蒋军在东北扩大内战中，美舰多艘又将开赴青岛，并作长期驻屯。据中央社青岛二日电讯内称：美国若干舰只，本月内将陆续驶青，各舰官员眷属，亦将赴青。当地国民党当局，已指拨接收敌伪之房产八十幢，为其住宅，现在修理布置中。第七舰队总部可能移青。
