Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 2nd: The Shanghai Wen Hui Bao published an editorial on May 25th entitled "The Situation After the Recovery of Changchun," hoping that the Kuomintang government would pull back from the brink and immediately begin peace negotiations. The editorial first summarized the recent statements made by responsible figures in the government, all of which were still in the stage of "military affairs being more important than politics" and "military takeover being more important than peace negotiations." It then commented that the recovery of Changchun was not a military victory because "from Sipingjie to Changchun, the main force of the CCP had already safely retreated. Fighting without eliminating the opponent's main force cannot be considered as having achieved the task...On the road from Sipingjie via Gongzhuling to Changchun, the CCP army did not implement military resistance and did not send troops to reinforce Changchun, indicating that the recovery of Changchun was relinquished by the CCP rather than taken by the government army. Moreover, the CCP's concession was at the same time as Mao Zedong's reply to the Democratic League, agreeing to its three proposals. This shows that this concession was based on political demands rather than military necessity." Regarding the Kuomintang army's offensive, the newspaper pointed out: "Neither locally nor comprehensively, is it absolutely advantageous. Because the Northeast battle line is extended and difficult to maintain, the government army currently occupies only a narrow, elongated position, while the CCP controls the entire ground area and can cut off the government army's position at any time. At the same time, the elite of the government army, five-thirds of it, is concentrated outside the Pass, and the military strength inside the Pass is weak. In the past month, the government propaganda machine has been fabricating rumors such as "emergency in the Pingjin Line" and "street fighting in Jinan" every day, which, although having a profound political effect, is also a proof of the government's fear of being attacked. General Marshall's effort to confine the war outside the Pass, on the one hand, is to localize the war and prevent it from developing into a full-scale civil war; on the other hand, does it not somewhat secretly help the government army and relieve the government army of its worries? As judged by ordinary American military officers, "The CCP's military strength in North China, especially in the rear, is considerable and has an overwhelming advantage over the government army." Therefore, the newspaper hopes: "After taking Changchun and gaining face, the government should quickly pull back from the brink, immediately start negotiations, and complete a comprehensive (including the Northeast) ceasefire." At the same time, it hopes that Mr. Marshall should immediately stop continuing to use American ships to transport Kuomintang troops to the Northeast to expand the civil war.

    沪文汇报社评
    长春是中共让出来的，希望国民党政府悬崖勒马，立即开始和平谈判。
    【新华社淮阴二日电】五月二十五日，沪文汇报发表社评“长春收复后之时局”，希望国民党政府悬崖勒马，立即开始和平谈判。该社评首先综述日来政府方面各负责人的表示，均还是在“军事重于政治”，“武力接收重于和平谈判”的阶段，继即评论长春的收复，并不是军事上的胜利，因为“由四平街到长春，中共的主力业已安然撤退了，作战而不能消灭对方的主力，这不能算是已经达成了任务。……在四平街经公主岭到长春的路上，中共军就没有实行军事抵抗，而且不派兵来增援长春，可见是长春的收复，是中共让出来的，而不是政府军打下来的。而且中共的让步，是在毛泽东答复民主同盟，同意其三项建议的同时。足见这一让步，与其说是军事的不得已，勿宁说是基于政治上的要求。”对于国民党军的进攻，该报指出：“无论在局部或全面，都不是绝对有利的。因为东北战线延长，维持难困，政府军目前所占不过一狭长阵地，而中共所控制的则为整个地面，而随时可以切断政府军阵地。同时政府军精锐，集中五分之三到关外，关内军力薄弱，最近一月来，政府宣传机构之天天造什么“平津线紧急”，“济南巷战”的谣言，虽然有深刻的政治作用，但也未尝不是政府恐惧被攻击的证明。而马歇尔将军之力图把战争局限于关外，一方面固然是竭力想把战争地方化，不使发展成为全国内战；另一方面何尝不多少带点暗中帮助政府军，替政府军解除后顾之虑的意思。如一般美军官所判断，“中共在华北尤其后方的兵力相当大，对政府军占压倒优势。”因此该报希望：“政府在拿下长春有了面子后，赶紧悬崖勒马，立即开始谈判，完成全面（包括东北在内）停战。”同时希望马歇尔氏，应该立刻停止继续用美舰运送国民党军去东北扩大内战。
