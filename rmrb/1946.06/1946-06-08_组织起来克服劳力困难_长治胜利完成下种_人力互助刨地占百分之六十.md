    【Report from this newspaper in Changzhi】Sowing throughout Changzhi County has now concluded. According to statistics from five districts (out of the county's eight districts): the sown area totals 329,879.8 mu. During the sowing campaign, mutual aid groups have greatly developed. In the five districts alone, 74,577 people participated, and mutual aid groups increased to 4,413. Due to a severe shortage of animal power, the area plowed and sown by people pulling plows and people digging the ground reached 230,800 mu, accounting for 60 percent of the local sown land. During the sowing campaign, a large number of labor heroes emerged. Jia Songlian, a woman from Xiangbi Village, plowed more than one mu of land in a single day. Many lazy people have also greatly changed as a result of the campaign. For example, Jing Fugeng from Beisongbi Village, who never used to go to the fields, is now able to voluntarily find people to help each other. In that district alone, 189 lazy people have been transformed, and most farmers have experienced the power of being organized. For example, farmer Li Guixin said: "I used to think mutual aid was a public matter, but after calculating the actual gains in the field, the whole group saved seventy-one workdays. Now I know that mutual aid is very beneficial and is for myself." The county is now summarizing the results of mutual aid, rectifying mutual aid, and organizing to welcome the weeding campaign.
    【News from this newspaper】After rent reduction in Wangjiaping Village, Lincheng New District, the entire village is actively engaged in production, filled with a new atmosphere. The village's eight mutual aid groups are launching a crash sowing campaign. Production difficulties have been resolved by the village cooperative (the cooperative's fund of more than 30,000 yuan was entirely earned from winter transport). Women are also enthusiastically engaged in spinning and weaving, with the sound of machines constantly heard. Wang Ernv, a spinning and weaving expert, uses a hand-operated shuttle loom and can weave more than six zhang of cloth per day. She is determined to teach all the women in the village how to use the new machines. An old woman in her fifties educated a lazy woman, Wang Renshen, who also turned to spinning and weaving. Wang used to wear ragged clothes and could not meet people, but this year she is wearing a brand new lined jacket and has saved 800 yuan. Elementary school students, in their spare time, boys collect manure, and girls sew and weave, solving the problem of learning expenses. Hygiene is also taken seriously throughout the village. Women sweep the streets and courtyards once a day, and everything is very clean. An old farmer, recalling the past, said: "Before liberation, the sixty-four households in our village cultivated more than 730 mu of land, of which more than 150 mu were wasteland. Many people only ate and didn't work, and some people wanted to work but faced great difficulties. No one in the village cared about anyone else." Talking about the present, he excitedly said: "Everyone is moving, everyone is learning well, helping each other, and time is passing really well."

    组织起来克服劳力困难
    长治胜利完成下种
    人力互助刨地占百分之六十
    【本报长治讯】长治全县下种现在已告结束。据五个区（全县八个区）的统计：下种面积共三十二万九千八百七十九亩八分。下种运动中，互助组大有发展。五个区里即有七万四千五百七十七人参加，互助组增至四千四百一十三个。由于畜力奇缺，人拉犁人刨地播种面积已达二十三万零八百亩，占当地下种土地百分之六十。在下种运动中，涌现出大批劳动能手，乡壁村妇女贾松连一天就刨地一亩多。许多懒汉也随着运动大大转变，如北宋壁村景福根过去从不上地，现在能够自动找人互助了。仅该区得到转变的懒汉即达一百八十九人，大部农民都已体验到组织起来力量大。如农民李贵心说：“以前我认为互助是公事，到地后算算实账，全组省了七十一个工，现在我才知道互助利大，是为自己。”现全县正在总结互助成果，整顿互助，组织起来迎接锄苗运动。
    【本报讯】临城新区王家坪村减租后，全村积极生产，充满着新生的气象。村里的八个互助组正突击下种。生产上的困难，已由村合作社解决（该社基金三万多元，全由冬季运输赚来）。妇女们也在热烈进行纺织，机声终日不断。纺织能手王二女使用手拉梭机，每日能织布六丈多。她并决心要教会全村妇女学会使用新机。一个五十多岁的老婆，教育一个懒妇女王壬申，也走向了纺织。王过去常穿破衣，不能见人，今年身上已穿上崭新的夹衣，身边还存有八百元。小学生在课余时，男孩拾粪，女孩缝织，解决了学习上的用费困难。讲卫生亦为全村所注意，妇女们每日打扫一次街院，到处都很整洁，一个老农民在回忆过去的景象时说：“翻身前俺村六十四户种的七百三十多亩地，荒地就有一百五十多亩，很多人光吃不动，有些人想动但是困难重重，村上人谁也不管谁。”谈到现在，他兴奋的说：“大家动弹，人人学好，互相帮忙，时光过的真好。”
