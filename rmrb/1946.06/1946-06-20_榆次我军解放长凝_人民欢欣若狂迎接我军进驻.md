[Report from our newspaper in Handan, 18th] Changning Town, a stronghold of Yan Xishan's anti-communist civil war in Yuci, was captured by our self-defense forces on the 16th. This area used to be an important supply point for the enemy to "mop up" our inland Yuci area. After the enemy surrendered, Yan Xishan's army continued to build bunkers here, and Changning became an advanced position for Yan's army to encroach upon and attack our Yuci Liberated Area. In just three days in the middle of last month, the masses in Shuangcun, Xiaojianan, Zhao Village and other places suffered three attacks from Yan's army stationed there, losing 20 livestock, and 28 able-bodied men and six women were seized. At the same time, the Yan army in Changning suddenly surrounded Beizhao Village, and in addition to looting, forcibly conscripted 60 civilians to rush to repair bunkers and fortifications to attack our Liberated Area. The local people were in extreme pain under such severe devastation by the Yan army, and most of the autumn land has not been cultivated to this day, presenting a scene of desolation everywhere. At the request of the local people, our Eighth Route Army rose up in self-defense on the 16th. By 5:00 p.m. on the 17th, our army entered Changning, killing and capturing more than 150 Yan soldiers, seizing nine light machine guns, two grenade launchers, and more than 100 rifles. The local masses witnessed the removal of the reactionary civil war fortress that had threatened them, and were overjoyed. They brought all kinds of fruits and pasta to welcome our army's entry.

    榆次我军解放长凝
    人民欢欣若狂迎接我军进驻
    【本报邯郸十八日电】榆次阎军反共内战据点长凝镇，十六日已为自卫我军攻克。该地过去为敌寇“扫荡”我榆次内地之有力补给点，敌人投降后，阎锡山军即继敌在此增修碉堡，长凝遂又成为阎军蚕食进攻我榆次解放区之前进阵地，仅上月中旬三天内，双村、小伽南，赵村等地群众，即遭受该处阎军三次袭击，抢失牲口二十头，抓走壮丁二十八人，妇女六人。同时，长凝阎军又突然包围北赵村，除抢掠外，并强征民夫六十人赶修进攻我解放区之碉堡工事，当地人民在阎军此种严重摧残下，痛苦万状，大部秋地至今未耕，到处呈现着一片荒凉。我八路军应当地人民之请，乃于十六日起而自卫，至十七日五时我军即进入长凝，共毙俘阎军一百五十余人，缴轻机枪九挺，掷弹筒两个，步枪百余支。当地群众目睹威胁自己的反动内战堡垒已被拔除，欢欣若狂。携带各种水果面食，欢迎我军进驻。
