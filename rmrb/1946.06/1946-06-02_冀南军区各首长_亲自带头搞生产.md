    Leading Cadres of the Jinnan Military Region
    Personally Take the Lead in Engaging in Production
    [This newspaper reports] All leading cadres of the Jinnan Military Region are personally taking action in this year's great production campaign, voluntarily finding land, accumulating fertilizer, and engaging in production together with their guards. Commander Du, Deputy Political Commissar Liu, Deputy Commander Wang, and Chief of Staff Chen, before the spring rains, turned the soil and planted cotton with their guards. The cotton is now almost fully emerged, and the leading cadres are weeding. In addition to the cotton fields, they have also planted a vegetable garden south of the headquarters. In particular, Deputy Political Commissar Liu has achieved even greater results. He cooperated with his guards and turned the soil early in the spring, planting Chinese cabbage, spinach, fennel, tomatoes, cucumbers, and yams. They have already sold eight hundred catties of Chinese cabbage and spinach, earning two thousand eight hundred yuan. They ate some themselves and still have five hundred catties left to sell. The total agricultural income is estimated at about twelve thousand yuan. They also plan to plant eggplants in the future. The guards have received their share of the profits and are even more confident. When they weed and water with the leading cadres, they are always smiling and working hard. The leading cadres' exemplary role has stimulated the production enthusiasm of every comrade. In particular, the "little devils" of the propaganda team are even more vocal. They have already found eighteen mu of land and are planning to plant late rice and sesame. (Weishan)

    冀南军区各首长
    亲自带头搞生产
    【本报讯】冀南军区各首长，在今年大生产运动中，都亲自下手，自动找地、积肥，与警卫员共同生产。杜司令员、刘副政委、王副司令员、陈参谋长，春雨前和警卫员们就把地翻好种上棉花，现棉花已快出齐，各首长正进行锄苗。除了棉地外，他们又在司令部南面，各种了一块菜园，特别是刘副政委，更有成绩，他与警卫员合作，一开春就把地翻好了，种了白菜、菠菜、茴茴白、西红柿、黄瓜、山药。现在白菜、波菜已卖了八百斤，计收二千八百元，自己吃了一部分，现尚余五百斤待卖，总计农业收入约一万二千元，将来还打算种茄子。警卫员们分了红，信心更高了，他们和首长们一块锄苗、浇水的时候，总是笑眯眯的劳动挺带劲。首长们的带头作用，刺激了每个同志的生产情绪，特别是宣传队的“小鬼”们，更是呱呱叫，他们已找好十八亩地，正计划种晚谷和芝麻。（微山）
