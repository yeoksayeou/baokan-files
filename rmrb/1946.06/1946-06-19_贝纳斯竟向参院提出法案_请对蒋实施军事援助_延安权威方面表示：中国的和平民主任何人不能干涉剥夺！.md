Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Certain authorities in the United States, unwilling to heed the calls of the Chinese people and various democratic parties to stop fueling China's civil war, are determined to continue providing military aid to the instigator of the Chinese civil war—the Chiang Kai-shek government. According to a U.S. Information Service dispatch from Washington on the 14th: "U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes today (14th) submitted a bill to the Senate requesting approval for the implementation of military training and technical assistance to China. In an attached letter, Byrnes pointed out: The continuous provision of military assistance to China is extremely important. Byrnes stated: China has requested the U.S. to send a military mission to China, the nature of which will be the same as the U.S. military delegations sent to Latin America. This bill, which allows the provision of military assistance to China, was jointly drafted by the Departments of the Army, Navy, and State. I firmly believe that the interests of the nation (including the interests of this country in rebuilding and maintaining peace and security in Asia) require the United States to assist China in organizing and maintaining a considerable number of modern armies, so that China can contribute to peace and security in that area." Sources here believe that while the CCP representatives in Nanjing are undergoing negotiations with Mr. Marshall and the Kuomintang government, striving for comprehensive and long-term peace in China, and while the Kuomintang is openly calling for a comprehensive and long-term civil war, the U.S. government's proposal of this bill encouraging China's civil war is truly an unfriendly expression towards the Chinese people's desire for peace. The facts are completely contrary to Byrnes' assertions. If this bill is passed, China will be plunged into serious unrest and insecurity. Furthermore, the interests of the American people and the credibility of the American nation will suffer significant losses. Chinese and world public opinion have repeatedly pointed out that the massive U.S. military aid to the bellicose Chinese Kuomintang dictatorial government is the sole fundamental condition that makes it difficult to stop the outbreak and expansion of the civil war in China today. The Chinese people cannot understand what right the U.S. government has to impose civil war and dictatorship on China, and to demand that China, like Latin America, be reduced to a U.S. sphere of influence or a part of the U.S. "national interest." The Chinese people also do not understand what right the U.S. government has to violate President Truman's statement last December that "the United States would not use its military to interfere in China's internal conflicts," and the principles of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference's communiqué on the China issue last December. An authoritative source in Yan'an stated: China's peace and democracy are the sacred rights of the Chinese people, and no one can interfere with or deprive them! If the reactionaries in China, relying on foreign aid, persist in civil war and dictatorship, if the current Kuomintang government openly and directly transforms into the government of Qin Hui, Zhang Bangchang, and Liu Yu, and transforms the current chairman of the Kuomintang government into a child emperor who pays tribute to foreign countries, then it can be asserted that the Chinese people will resist to the last drop of blood.

    贝纳斯竟向参院提出法案
    请对蒋实施军事援助
    延安权威方面表示：中国的和平民主任何人不能干涉剥夺！
    【新华社延安十六日电】美国若干当局，不愿中国人民与各民主党派停止助长中国内战之呼吁，决心继续在军事上援助中国内战的发动者——蒋介石政府。据美国新闻处华盛顿十四日电：“美国务卿贝纳斯今（十四日）以法案提交参院，请求核准对华实施军事训练及技术上之援助。在附函中贝氏指出：对华军事援助之继续不断，极为重要。贝氏称：中国曾请求美方遣派军事使团驻华，其性质将与美国遣往拉丁美洲之军事代表团相同。此次准许驿华实施军事援助之法案，系由陆海两部及国务院联合拟订。本人坚信国家之利益（包括本国在重建与维护亚洲和平及安全之利益），需要美国援助中国组织与维持相当数量之现代化军队，俾中国可对该方面之和平与安全有所贡献”。此间人士认为当南京的中共代表正经过马歇尔氏与国民党政府进行谈判，力争中国全面长期和平，而国民党方面正公然号召全面长期内战之际，美国政府提出此项鼓励中国内战之法案，诚为对于中国人民和平愿望之一种不友好表示。事实与贝氏的断言完全相反，此项法案如被通过，则中国将陷于严重的不和平不安全之中。而美国人民的利益与美国国家的信誉，亦将因此遭受重大的损失。中国与世界舆论，均已再三指明美国对好战的中国国民党独裁政府的巨大军事援助，乃是中国今日内战发生扩大之难于制止的唯一根本条件。中国人民不能了解美国政府究有何种权利，将内战与独裁强加于中国，并要求中国与拉丁美洲同样降为美国势力范围，或为美国“国家利益”范围之一部分。中国人民亦不了解美国政府，究有何种权利破坏杜鲁门总统去年十二月“不以军事干涉，影响中国任何内争过程”的声明，与去年十二月莫斯科三国外长会议关于中国问题公报的原则。延安权威方面表示：中国的和平民主，乃是中国人民神圣权利所在，任何人不能予以干涉与剥夺！中国的反动派，如果依靠外力援助，坚持内战与独裁，即现在的国民党政府公开直接变为秦桧、张邦昌、刘豫政府，将现在的国民党政府主席变为向外国称臣的儿皇帝，那么，可以断言：中国人民必将抵抗至最后一滴血。
