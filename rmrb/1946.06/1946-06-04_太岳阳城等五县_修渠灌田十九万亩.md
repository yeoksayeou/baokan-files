    Taiyue Yangcheng and Other Five Counties
    Repair Canals to Irrigate 190,000 Mu of Fields
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng News] The masses in Yangcheng, Tunliu, Anze, Jiang County, and Jiexiu counties are rushing to build water conservancy projects to turn 190,000 mu of dry land into irrigated land. Ten river canals have now been completed, which can irrigate 4,955 mu of land. Jiexiu has completed Wenjin Spring, Longdong Spring, Niujin Spring, and Houbu Spring, which can increase paddy fields by 500 mu. There are plans to use ditch rivers, Longfeng River, Zhang River, Liang River, and mountain water for irrigation, which can turn 3,000 mu of dry land into irrigated land. In Huaiquan Village, District 3, Jiang County, there were originally two large canals, but due to enemy and puppet harassment over the past eight years, the riverbeds were silted up and had long lost their effectiveness. After rent reduction and interest rate reduction in the village, the masses' enthusiasm for production increased, so they organized a production committee to start dredging. After the canal was unblocked, it could also irrigate more than 1,100 mu of land, and the second canal is also being rushed to repair. In Duogou Yaotou Village, Anze County, a new canal has been built, which can not only irrigate 4,000 mu of land, but also set up a water mill to facilitate mass production. In the areas of Shengou, Chuzhuang, and Xi＠men in Wangwu County, the masses have repaired the 13-li-long Dongyang Spring, which can irrigate more than 700 mu of land. The Dishiqu Canal was also completed on the 14th of last month, with a length of 2.5 li, which can irrigate 500 mu of land. In Shifeng Village, Yangcheng, the construction of a 2-li-long canal only requires 100 workers, and it can now irrigate more than 1,500 mu of land. When building canals in various places, the government sends water conservancy teams to help with surveying and other work.

    修渠灌田十九万亩
    【本报阳城讯】阳城、屯留、安泽、绛县、介休等五县群众，正赶修水利，使十九万亩旱地变成水地。现已修成河渠十条，可浇地四千九百五十五亩，介休已修成问津泉、龙洞泉、牛金泉、候堡泉，可增水田五百亩。现正计划在沟河、龙风河、张河、良河和用山水浇地，可使三千亩旱地变成水地。绛县三区槐泉村，原有两条大渠，八年来由于敌伪扰害，水床淤塞，早已失掉效用。该村减租减息后，群众生产情绪增高，于是组织起生产委员会动工疏浚，该渠畅通后，亦可浇地一千一百多亩，第二条渠亦赶修中。安泽县多沟窑头村，新修水渠一条，除浇地四千亩外，还可架设水磨，便利群众生产。王屋县神沟、敕庄、西＠门一带，群众已将十三里长的东阳泉修复，可浇地七百多亩。底石渠亦于上月十四日修成，渠长二里半，可浇地五百亩。阳城狮峰村，兴渠二里长，河渠一条仅需工一百，现可浇地一千五百余亩，各地兴修河渠时，政府均派水利组前往帮助测量等工作。
