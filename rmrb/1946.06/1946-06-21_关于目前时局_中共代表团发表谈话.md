Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 14th: The spokesman of the CCP delegation recently issued a statement on the current situation as follows:

(1) Northeast Truce Issue: We have always advocated that the Northeast issue, like the national issue, should be resolved through political consultation. Although the Kuomintang authorities insisted on implementing a one-party dictatorship in the Northeast, denied the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army and other anti-Japanese armed forces that had persisted in the Northeast's resistance against Japan for fourteen years to form a democratic joint army, and denied the local democratic government in the Northeast, this created a painful civil war in the Northeast. However, we have always adhered to our consistent peaceful policy, repeatedly urging the government to cease fire and striving to avoid the calamity of war. However, since the battles of Shanhaiguan and Jinzhou, many opportunities and requests to stop the civil war in the Northeast have been missed and rejected by the government. This short-term fifteen-day truce in the Northeast, although far from the wishes of the Chinese people, is still welcome if it can reopen the door to peace and pave the way for a long-term truce.

Now that the ceasefire order has been issued for nearly a week, judging from the government's actions, the deployment for the civil war is still in full swing, and the propaganda also groundlessly emphasizes the restoration of sovereignty and distorts the causes of the military conflicts, deliberately using them to create excuses for the civil war. In fact, only allowing foreign troops to be stationed in China, foreign ships to navigate in China's inland rivers, etc., will cause sovereignty issues. Emphasizing the issue of restoration to the local governments and their armed forces of the Chinese people is meaningless except for creating excuses for the civil war. However, according to the statements of Generals Xiong Shihui and Du Yuming before and after the issuance of the ceasefire order on the 6th of this month, people cannot help but doubt the sincerity of the Kuomintang authorities in implementing a ceasefire in the Northeast. After our army withdrew from Changchun, Generals Xiong Shihui and Du Yuming issued a telegram on May 22, emphasizing that they would not be satisfied with taking Changchun, but would require our army to withdraw from major cities and along the railways in the Northeast. On the same day that the ceasefire order took effect (7th), General Du Yuming made a lengthy statement at a press conference with Chinese and foreign reporters, saying: "The National Army expects to continue the restoration of the main areas after the 15th, including Dalian, Andong, Nenjiang, Songjiang, Hejiang, Heilongjiang, and Xing'an provinces, as well as transportation lines and cities." Such a statement makes the ceasefire meaningless. By the fifth day of the ceasefire (11th), the Central News Agency reported: General Du Yuming publicly limited our army to withdraw from Lafa by 12:00 noon on the 12th, otherwise, he would break the agreement and take action. These are clearly not seeking peace through a ceasefire, but rather buying time, carrying out a ceasefire, waiting for reinforcements, and plotting to fight again.

The facts also illustrate and prove the attitude of the Kuomintang authorities. Since the Democratic Allied Army withdrew from Sipingjie and Changchun, the Kuomintang army has continued to occupy Dongfeng, Yitong, Shuangyang, Hailong, Panshi, Wanbaoshan, Nong'an, Jiutai, Yongji, Dehui, Liaoyuan, Shuangshan, Huaide, Huadian (later recovered by us) and other nineteen important cities. Even after the ceasefire order took effect, the Kuomintang army's offensive in the Northeast did not stop; although we have difficulties with transportation, according to known facts, it is proved that the Kuomintang army is attacking on all lines in the east, west, north, and south of the Northeast. At noon on the 7th, the Kuomintang army in Haicheng attacked Ximu City in the east. On the 8th, the Kuomintang army attacked Dingjiafangshen and other towns near Faku (Editor's note: Faku was occupied by the Kuomintang army on the 8th). On the same day, another route attacked our army's positions northwest of Tieling, occupied Zhenxibao, and also advanced towards Faku. In the Benxi area, the Kuomintang army began attacking our army's positions south and southwest of it in two routes since the 7th. On the northern front, the Kuomintang air force continued to bombard Dunhua, Jiaohe, and peaceful residents fiercely after the 7th.

(2) Intra-Wall Conflict Issue: From the January 10th truce agreement to May 20th, according to our existing materials, the Kuomintang army launched 3,635 large and small attacks on the intra-wall liberated areas, using a total force of 2.58 million people, forcibly occupied 2,077 villages and towns in our liberated areas, and 26 county towns. If all the materials can be collected, this statistic will be even more than this.

Secondly, regarding the mobilization of troops. According to the January truce agreement, troops cannot be mobilized freely, but according to existing materials, from January 13th to the end of May, the Kuomintang army mobilized a total of 42 armies, 118 divisions, 2 engineering regiments, 2 artillery regiments, and 1 artillery battalion, totaling more than 1.3 million mobilizations. Again, regarding the construction of bunkers to obstruct traffic, the Kuomintang army built 2,104 bunkers in the southern Hebei and southern Shanxi areas (i.e., around our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu liberated area), and more than 6,000 bunkers in the southern Henan and northern Hubei areas (i.e., around our Central Plains liberated area). If all the bunkers around the liberated areas are counted, this number will inevitably be frighteningly large. Anyone who has flown over or walked on the ground around the liberated areas will see the bunkers built around them. Next, regarding the repatriation of prisoners, as far as we know, there are still 7,000 Japanese troops retained in Shanxi, including 1,000 near Datong, 1,200 near Yanggao, about 1,000 in Yuci, 300 in the Taiyuan Officer Training School, about 200 in Qingyuan, 3,000 in Shuoxian, 150 in Yuanping, 200 in Taigu, and some that have not been counted. These surviving Japanese troops are still armed and occasionally launch sneak attacks on our army. These statistics show that the Kuomintang authorities are constantly undermining the truce agreement they signed with their own hands. As for the specific facts of attacking our army, not to mention the distant past, just speaking of May and June, first in the Pingjin area, in late May, the Kuomintang army planned to invade our Anci County and Panggezhuang area north of the Yongding River, and occupied Anci City. In early June, they began to attack our Xianghe and Baodi counties in eastern Hebei, fierce battles are still going on and are developing. Secondly, it is the Xuzhou area of ​​Shandong. In addition to continuously increasing troops in Xuzhou and actively preparing to go north, the Kuomintang authorities occupied Xiayi and Xiaoxian, two cities south of Longhai, in mid-May. In Dezhou, Tai'an, Dawenkou, Zhoucun, Zhangdian, Jiaozhou, Zaozhuang and other places, they instigated puppet troops to actively provoke us and rob them everywhere. These puppet troops include Wang Jinxiang, the pseudo-security army in Dezhou, Ning Chunlin, the pseudo-first army in Tai'an, Zhang Jingyue, the pseudo-third army in Zhoucun Zhangdian, and Zhang Buyun and Zhao Baoyuan, the pseudo-national self-defense army in Jiaoxian. They either disturbed the people or attacked us, their intention being nothing more than to provoke war in order to facilitate their existence and development. Our army sees through their tricks, so we only counterattack when they are extremely presumptuous. Recently, these puppet troops have surrendered one after another, which is really a great harm to the country, especially to Shandong. The situation in Jiangbei is becoming increasingly urgent. Since Dingyuan was occupied on May 13, the Kuomintang army has been suppressing and suppressing the county for three months, and 600,000 people have been severely devastated. Recently, on the day of the truce in the Northeast, the government ordered its 75th Army, 7th Army, and one division of the 74th Army to occupy Lai'an County and attack Tianchang, while the Kuomintang army in Nantong and Taixing on the north bank of the Yangtze River moved north one after another. The Kuomintang army in Donghai also began to go south to disturb the area. The entire Jiangbei area has the possibility of being completely involved in the civil war. In the Shanxi area, since May 17, Yan Xishan's army and the Kuomintang Central Army attacked our Jiwang Mountain area south of the Fen River with more than 20,000 troops. After more than 20 days of fierce fighting, this area that we had liberated for seven years has been forcibly occupied by them. In northwestern Shanxi, from April 18 to the end of May, Yan's army joined forces with the enemy and puppet troops to attack us 142 times, large and small, averaging three times a day, with a total of more than 10,000 troops used. They have now occupied most of Jiaocheng and Wenshui counties. Taking the Central Plains region as an example, since the signing of the Central Plains Truce Agreement on May 10, the Kuomintang army in Xinyang and Biyang areas of southern Henan, Yunmeng and Huangpo, Huang'an in Hubei, and the area south of Huangpo and Huang'an have successively attacked us more than ten times, and occupied many places. This kind of occupation is still expanding. In short, world public opinion is seriously paying attention to this fact and earnestly urging the Kuomintang authorities to abandon this attempt to undermine the truce agreement and start a full-scale civil war.

(3) The Crisis of the Situation: We communists do not shy away from the seriousness of the situation, because the warmongers in China, since the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, are leading China step by step onto an extremely dangerous path. Judging from the military and financial conferences held in Nanjing earlier this month, as well as the official propaganda negotiations, on the one hand, they exposed the authorities' deep crisis in military, economic, and popular support, on the other hand, most unfortunately, the authorities did not face these crises squarely, comply with the wishes of the people of the whole country, and adopt a policy of peace and democracy to overcome this crisis. On the contrary, they adopted the wrong policy of preparing to expand the civil war, attempting to use the methods of "pouring soup to stop boiling" and "carrying firewood to put out the fire" to solve their own difficulties. Therefore, it will inevitably deepen the crisis of the situation. The only difference is that they put together some peaceful terms to cover up the essence of the civil war policy, and further used speech control (not allowing the registration of CCP newspapers and news agencies, and forcing the suspension of Peiping Liberation Daily, Xinhua News Agency, and Shanghai English Xinhua Weekly), one-sided propaganda, and attempted to impose the responsibility for the civil war that they themselves planned, arranged, and led on the CCP and democratic人士. Of course, this will not improve the situation, nor will it get rid of the Kuomintang authorities' own crisis, and it will inevitably throw all the Chinese people into a terrible situation. We want to once again draw the attention of the Kuomintang authorities and the entire Chinese people that the Kuomintang warmongers must not be allowed to play with the fire of civil war!

(4) Recent Negotiations: The entire public opinion circles and the entire Chinese people are very concerned about the recent negotiations, which is a very good phenomenon. The inside story of the negotiations is not yet the time to publish, but it should be pointed out that we very much hope that the negotiations can end smoothly as soon as possible, and that the news of success can be published as soon as possible, in order to stabilize the anxious hearts of the people across the country who are waiting. We can first tell our compatriots across the country that our attitude towards the negotiations is very sincere and straightforward. Although we find the ultimatum-style documents very regrettable, we will not let go of any hope for peace and strive for opportunities. Whether in the central government or in the local areas, as long as there is a possibility of ceasefire and peaceful negotiation, we will not only not refuse to participate, but also promote its further development and continuation, and quickly promote true peace. We are willing to solve problems step by step in a practical and realistic manner in the process of this negotiation, in order to enhance confidence in the negotiation and facilitate the progress of the negotiation. Therefore, problems can be solved one by one, and the scope can be easy first and difficult later, in order to open up a new situation, so that the current extremely tense situation can turn to ease, and the temporary truce can become a long-term truce, which is exactly the hope of the people of the whole country. At the same time, we also warn the warmongers in the Kuomintang that half of the truce period has passed, and the problem must be solved, but it can be solved one by one. Peace and democracy are the way out for China, and it is also everyone's future. (Missing number in the middle) The opposite of attack is resistance. Whoever wants to play with fire will burn himself first!

### 关于目前时局  中共代表团发表谈话

　　关于目前时局
    中共代表团发表谈话
    【新华社南京十四日电】中共代表团发言人顷就目前时局发表谈话如下：
    （一）东北停战问题：我们一向是主张东北问题，应和全国问题一样用政治协商方法解决的，虽然因为国民党当局坚持要在东北实行一党专政，否认坚持东北抗战十四年的抗日联军和其他抗日武装合组的民主联军，否认东北的地方民主政权，因此便在东北造成了可痛的内战。但我们总是本着一贯的和平方针，一再敦促政府停战，力争避免战祸的。可是从山海关、锦州战时起，许多次停止东北内战的机会和要求，都被政府放过和拒绝了。这次东北十五天短期的休战，虽然为中国人民的愿望相差甚远，如果能由此重开和平之门，为长期停战开辟道路，仍是值得欢迎的。
    现在停战令发布已近一周，按诸政府方面之行动，则内战部署仍在全面进行，在宣传上也毫无理由的强调接收主权与歪曲军事冲突的原因，故意以之制造内战借口。其实只有容许外国在华驻军，外轮在中国内河航行等等，才会发生主权问题。如对中国人民的地方政府及其武装而强调接收问题，除掉为着制造内战借口外，别无意义。但在本月六日休战命令发布前后，照熊式辉、杜聿明两将军的表示看来，令人对于国民党当局在东北实行休战的诚意，不能不发生怀疑。我军撤出长春后，熊式辉、杜聿明两将军于五月廿二日曾发表通电，不以取得长春为满足，而强调要我军退出在东北各大城市和铁路沿线。在休战令生效之同日（七日），杜聿明将军又在中外记者招待会上发表长篇声明谓：“国军预计于十五日后，继续接收之主要区域为大连市、安东、嫩江、松江、合江、黑龙江与兴安各省及交通线与城市”。这样说法，就使休战成为没有意义。休战至第五日（十一日），中央社报导：杜聿明将军又公开限我军于十二日午十二时退出拉法，否则将破约采取行动。这些显然不是休战以求和平，而系争取时间，进行休战，等待增援，以谋再战。
    事实也说明了与证明着国民党当局这一个态度。自民主联军退出四平街、长春后，国民党军队即继续攻占东丰、伊通、双阳、海龙、磐石、万宝山、农安、九台、永吉、德惠、辽源、双山、怀德、桦甸（后被我收复）等十九个重要城市。就是在休战命令生效后，国民党军队在东北的进攻，也并没有停止；虽然因为我们交通困难，但据已知之事实，证明国民党军队在东北之东西南北各线，均在进攻。七日中午海城国民党军队东攻析木城，八日国民党军队向法库附近镇市丁家房身等多处进攻（编者按法库已于八日被国民党军攻占）。同日另一路从铁岭向其西北我军阵地进攻，占领镇西堡后，亦向法库前进。本溪方面国民党军队自七日起，分两路向其以南及西南我军阵地进攻。在北线国民党空军，七日以后，仍猛烈轰炸敦化、蛟河和平居民。
    （二）关内冲突问题：自一月十日停战协定起到五月二十日止，据我们现有的材料统计，国民党军队向关内各解放区大小进攻达三千六百三十五次之多，使用兵力共为二百五十八万余人，强占我解放区村镇二千○七十七个，县城二十六座。如能搜集全部材料，则这个统计数字还不止此。
    其次关于军队之调动。根据一月停战协定，军队不能自由调动，但据现有材料，自一月十三日至五月底为止，国民党军队共调动了四十二个军，一百十八个师，二个工兵团，二个炮兵团，及一个炮兵营，共计有一百三十余万人调动。再次，关于修筑碉堡阻碍交通，国民党军队在冀南、晋南地区（即我之晋冀鲁豫解放区周围），修筑碉堡二千一百○四座，在豫南、鄂北地区（即我之中原解放区周围），修筑碉堡六千座以上。如果把各解放区周围的碉堡全部统计，这个数目必然大得吓人。凡是在解放区周围上空飞行过或在地面上走过的人，都会看到周围筑的碉堡的。又次，关于遣俘，据我们所知，在山西还保留有七千名日军，其中在大同附近者千名，阳高附近者一千二百名，榆次约一千名，太原军官训练所三百名，清源约二百名，朔县三千名，原平一百五十名，太谷二百名，还有些未计算在内。这些日军健在仍有武装，对我军不时偷袭。以上这些统计，说明国民党当局不断的破坏自己亲手签订的停战协定。至于进攻我军的具体事实，远者不论，单就五、六月说，首先在平津地区，五月下旬国民党军队有计划的向永定河北岸我之安次县及庞各庄一带侵犯，并占领安次城。六月初，开始向我冀东之香河、宝坻两县进攻，激战未已，现正在发展中。其次，是山东徐州方面。国民党当局除不断增兵徐州，积极准备北上外，五月中，曾攻占我陇海南之夏邑、萧县两城。在德州、泰安、大汶口、周村、张店、胶州、枣庄等处，则策动伪军向我积极挑衅，四出抢劫。这些伪军有德州之伪治安军王逆金祥，泰安之伪一方面军宁逆春霖，周村张店之伪三方面军张逆景月，胶县之伪国民自卫军张逆步云及赵逆保元等，他们或则出扰人民，或则向我进攻、其企图不外是挑起战争，以便利其存在和发展。我军洞烛其奸，故只在其极端放肆时，方予还击。最近这些伪军已经纷纷投诚，对全国尤其对山东说来，实在除害不小。江北形势日益紧急，自五月十三日定远被占后，国民党军队在该县清剿了三月之久，六十万人民受着极端摧残。最近在东北休战之日，政府又令其七十五军、第七军、及七十四军各一师，攻占来安县城，并向天长进攻，而沿江北岸之南通、泰兴两地国民党军队，又纷纷北进。东海之国民党军，亦开始南下出扰，整个江北地区，有全部卷入内战可能。山西地区，自五月十七日起，阎锡山军和国民党中央军以两万余兵力，向汾河以南我稷王山地区进攻，激战二十余日，现这块被我解放了七年的地区，已经被其强占而去。晋西北方面，自四月十八日起至五月底止，这四十多天中，阎军联合敌伪军向我进攻，大小达一百四十二次，平均每日三次，使用兵力总数在万人以上，现已将我交城、文水二县大部地区占去。以中原地区而论，自五月十日签定中原停战协定后，国民党军队在豫南信阳、泌阳一带，湖北云梦、及黄坡、黄安以及黄坡黄安以南一带，仍先后向我进攻十余次，并侵占许多地方，现此种侵占仍在扩大中。总之，世界舆论严重注重这一事实，并切实督促国民党当局放弃这种破坏停战协定打起全国内战的企图。
    （三）时局的危机：我们共产党人不讳言时局的严重性，因为中国的好战分子，从国民党二中全会以后，正把中国一步一步引上极端危险的道路。从本月初在南京举行的军事会议与财粮会议，以至官方宣传商谈的经过看来，一方面暴露了当局在军事、经济和人心上的深刻危机，另一方面，最不幸的是当局没有正视这些危机，顺从全国人民的愿望，采取和平、民主的政策来克服这个危机，相反的，还采取了准备扩大内战的错误政策，企图以“扬汤止沸”“抱薪救火”的方法，解救自己的困难。因此，必然更加深化了时局的危机。所不同的，是凑了些和平的名词，来掩盖内战政策的实质，更利用了言论统制（不允许中共的报纸、通讯社登记，迫令北平解放报、新华通讯社及上海英文新华周刊停刊），片面宣传，企图把他们自己计划布置和领导的内战责任，加在中共和民主人士身上。这当然不能使时局好转，也不能脱离国民党当局自身的危机，而且必然会把全中国人民投入可怕的境遇。我们要再一次提起国民党当局和全中国人民的注意，不能允许国民党好战分子玩内战之火了！
    （四）最近的谈判：关于最近谈判，全国舆论界和全中国人民都很关心，这是很好的现象。谈判的内幕，现在还不到发表的时候，但应该指出，我们极希望谈判能早日顺利结束，能早日发表成功的消息，以安定全国焦急等待的人心。可以先告诉全国同胞，我们对于谈判的态度是很真诚直率的，我们对于最后通牒式的文件，虽然认为十分遗憾，但是凡有一线和平希望，我们毫不放过争取机会，无论在中央在地方，只要有休战和平商谈的可能，我们不但不拒绝参加，而且要推动其进一步的发展与继续，及迅速促成真正和平。我们愿将此次协商的程序，实事求是的按步就班的解决问题，以增强谈判信心与便利谈判的进行。因此，解决问题可以一个一个解决，其范围也可先易后难，以便打开新的局面，使目前极端紧张的局势，能够转向和缓，使暂时的休战，成为长期的停战，这正是全国人民的希望。同时，我们也正告国民党中的好战分子，休战的日期已过了一半，问题非解决不可，但是可以一个一个的解决。和平民主是中国的出路，也是大家的前途，（中缺数字）进攻的对面是抵抗，谁要玩火，谁就会先烧了自己！
