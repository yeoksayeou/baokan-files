The People of Jiang County Say:
    If the Traitor Chen Ziwen is Not Eliminated, the People of Jiang County Will Never Have Peace
    [This newspaper's Yangcheng dispatch, 21st] This reporter interviewed people from all walks of life in Jiang County, including workers, farmers, soldiers, women, and respected elders. Their common opinion is: "If the great traitor Chen Ziwen is not eliminated, the people will never have a peaceful day!" Chen Ziwen is the pseudo-army that the people of Jiang County hate the most. As early as 1943, Chen made an agreement with the Japanese invaders in Jiang County. The Japanese invaders then designated the fourth district of Jiang County as Chen's area of activity. Chen also used the ammunition issued by Yan Xishan to replenish the puppet police force, often cooperating with the Japanese invaders to attack the Eighth Route Army and rob the people of their property, which was deeply hated by the people of Jiang County. When the Japanese invaders announced their surrender, and the people of Jiang County and the Eighth Route Army were actively disarming the Japanese army, Chen sent hundreds of armed men to help cover the retreat of the Japanese army. Since then, Chen has replaced the Japanese invaders and cruelly ruled the people of Jiang County. Tan Tongxin, a large household in the fourth district of the county, had more than 300 mu of land. Under Chen's various oppressions, two-thirds of the land was taken away by Chen, and ninety-four mules turned into two cows. In the east street of Nanliu Village, there are a total of twenty households. Because of the extremely heavy burden, more than a dozen households fled one after another. Chen said, "The monk can run away, but the temple can't." More than sixty houses of the fleeing households were demolished. Farmers who did not escape were forced to sell their land to pay Chen's burden. Now the rich are poor, and the poor are even more unable to live. Among the 65,000 compatriots in Jiang County, 2,000 were massacred during the eight years of enemy rule. After the national armistice agreement, Chen launched a crazy attack on our liberated areas from Jiang County and the Xuluyu stronghold, occupying more than a dozen villages such as Xicun and Dongma Village, and invading more than thirty villages. The Kuomintang also transported ammunition by plane to support Chen's breach of contract. Since the armistice, according to very incomplete statistics, Chen has launched more than 54 attacks on our liberated areas, using more than 7,640 troops. In addition, he also sent a large number of special agents and bandits to sneak into our border areas to carry out sabotage. In Xuluyu, there is an assassination team headed by Ma Duo. The bandits in the southwest mountainous area of Jiang County are directly led by Pei Yu, the special agent captain of Chen. The soldiers of the bandit unit are all remnants of Jia Zhenyi's former puppet "Southern Shanxi Communist Suppression Army". They operate between Jiang County and Xuluyu. Among them, the residents of more than thirty villages including Lanyu, covering an area of 160 li, have suffered severe destruction, with 15 village cadres and 51 members of the masses killed, more than 170 people arrested, 3,000 shi of grain and 800,000 yuan in legal tender looted. Under Chen's terror and devastation, the masses of Jiang County have now organized themselves, established militia armed forces, and are actively carrying out self-defense. All 65,000 people in the county are shouting: "Catch Chen Ziwen and tear him apart!" They also ask the democratic government and the Eighth Route Army to take charge, disarm Chen, and live a peaceful life.

　　绛县人民说：
    不消灭汉奸陈子文  绛县人民永无宁日
    【本报阳城二十一日电】记者访问了绛县工人、农民、士兵、妇女以及乡绅父老等各阶层人士，他们共同的意见是：“不消灭大汉奸陈子文，人民永无安宁的日子！”陈子文是绛县人民最痛恨的伪军，远在民国三十二年，陈逆即与绛县日寇订立协定，日寇遂将绛县四区划为陈逆活动地区，陈逆并把阎锡山发给的弹药，补充伪警备队，经常配合日寇袭击八路军，打劫人民财物，为绛县人民所切齿痛恨。当日寇宣布投降，绛县人民与八路军，正积极进行解除日军武装时，陈逆却派了数百人的武装，帮助掩护日军撤退，从此陈逆就代替了日寇而残酷的统治绛县人民。该县四区大户谭统新，家有土地三百多亩，在陈逆的百般压榨下，三分之二的土地全被陈逆夺去，九四骡子，变成了二头牛。南柳村东街，共有二十户人家，因为负担奇重，就有十几户相率逃亡，对此陈逆反说：“跑了和尚跑不了寺”。逃亡户的六十余间房子便被拆掉了，没有逃走的农民，便被迫出卖自己的土地来缴纳陈逆的负担。现在富的穷了，穷的更无法生活了，绛县六万五千同胞在敌统治八年中，被屠杀者二千人。全国停战协定以后，陈逆反由绛县与续鲁峪据点，疯狂向我解放区进攻，侵占我西村、东马村等十数村庄，侵入村庄，达三十余村，国民党并以飞机运送弹药，支持陈逆的违约进攻。从停战以来，据极不完全统计，陈逆向我解放区进攻达五十四次之多，使用兵力七千六百四十余人。此外、更派遣大批特务土匪，潜入我边沿区进行破坏，在续鲁峪有以马铎为首的暗杀队，在绛县西南山地的土匪，是由陈逆特务队长裴玉管直接领导的，该匪部士兵均为前伪“晋南剿共军”贾真一残部，他们活动于绛县与续鲁峪间。其中有兰峪等三十多个村庄、一百六十华里面积的居民，遭受到严重摧残，残杀我区村干部十五名，群众五十一名，被捕走者一百七十余人，抢去粮食三千石，法币八十万元。在陈逆此种恐怖摧残下，现绛县群众已纷纷组织起来，成立了民兵武装，积极进行自卫。全县六万五千群众都呼喊着：“捉到陈子文，抽了他的筋！”他们并要求民主政府八路军作主，解除陈逆武装，好过和平的日子。
