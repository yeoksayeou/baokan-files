Exchange Summer Goods Between Mountainous and Plain Areas
    Xingtai City Revives the May Temple Fair

    [Report from our Xingtai Bureau] The Chenghuang Temple Fair in Xingtai City, which had been suspended for twenty-five years, was revived on May 17th. This fair is a summer goods trade fair. Bamboo goods from Qinghua, such as bamboo curtains and various bamboo utensils, grass hats from Changzhi, cattail leaf fans from Yongnian, summer cloth from various places in the South, and various medicinal herbs collected by mountain people in the spring are all sold here in exchange for various daily necessities for summer. At this time, merchants from Tianjin, Beijing, Baoding and other places also come here to purchase various summer goods and medicinal herbs. This fair was effectively suspended after 1921 due to warlord infighting, during which merchants' goods were repeatedly looted, and because the prefectural government was changed to a county government. After the "July 7th" Incident, the enemy suppressed this kind of mass commercial gathering entirely. After our army liberated Xingtai last year, our government, in view of the demands of the citizens and the masses of surrounding counties, first restored the October 18th Fire God Temple Fair to promote the exchange of materials between mountainous and plain areas. At the beginning of this summer, the May 17th Chenghuang Temple Fair was restored to facilitate the masses to trade summer goods at this fair. The municipal government issued notices to merchants in various places on the ninth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar. The conference started on May 13th. There were popular Peking Opera and Hebei Clapper Opera performances invited by the masses on the venue. Not far from the stage, there were two cultural propaganda sheds organized by the Municipal Education Section and the Municipal People's Education Center, and a health propaganda shed. Every day, the crowds were packed. Various summer goods and other daily necessities needed by the masses were piled all over the venue. On the 17th, the number of people attending the fair reached more than 20,000. Many ordinary people said: "We haven't seen such a big gathering in more than 20 years." (Zemin, Wenru)

　　交流山地平原夏货
    邢市恢复五月大庙会
    【本报邢台讯】停顿了二十五年的邢台市五月十七日城隍庙大会，现在又复活了。这个大会是一个夏货的交易大会，清华一带的竹货，如竹帘，及各种竹器用品，长治的草帽，永年的蒲扇，南方各地的夏布，和山地群众春季所采各种药材，都要到此销售，购回各种日用夏货；此时平津、保定各处商人亦到此购回各种夏货，和药材。该会自民国十年后，因军阀内战，商人货物累遭抢劫，且府治改县，故此会即无形停顿；“七七”事变，敌寇对此种群众性的商业集会，压制无余。去年我军解放邢台后，我政府鉴于市民及周围各县群众的要求，首先恢复了十月十八日火神庙会，使山地平原的物资交流；本年夏初又恢复了五月十七日城隍庙会，以便群众在此会上进行夏货交易，市府特于四月初九发给各地商人通知，大会五月十三开始，会场上有群众邀的京梆大戏，在戏台的不远，有市府教育科与市立民教馆，组织的两个文化宣传棚，和一个卫生宣传棚，每天人群挤满。各种夏货及其他群众日常必需品等堆满会场。十七日这天赴会人数达两万余。很多老百姓说：“二十多年来不见这样的大会了”。        （泽民、文儒）
