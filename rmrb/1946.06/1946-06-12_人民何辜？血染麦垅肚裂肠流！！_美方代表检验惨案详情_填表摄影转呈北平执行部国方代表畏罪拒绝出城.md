What crime have the people committed? Blood stains the wheat fields, bellies are split and intestines flow!!
U.S. representative inspects the details of the massacre, filling out forms and taking photos to forward to the Peiping Executive Headquarters. The Nationalist representative, fearing punishment, refuses to leave the city.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Kuomintang reactionaries, driven mad, sent fighter planes and bombers to strafe peaceful residents of Yongnian and the Communist troops guarding the crashed plane, resulting in a total of thirty-three military and civilian casualties, creating the unprecedented "June 6th" massacre. As reported previously, the Communist representative of the Yongnian Executive Group delivered a memorandum to the Nationalist and U.S. representatives on the morning of the 7th. The Nationalist representative, Zhang Chaozheng, knowing he was in the wrong, refused to leave the city to investigate and inspect the dead and wounded soldiers and civilians. At 9:00 a.m. on the 8th, U.S. Representative Lieutenant Colonel Olson, accompanied by Communist Representative Colonel Wang Yumin and local garrison commander Zhao Haifeng, went to Dayingtou to listen to the detailed account of the massacre of twenty-eight civilians from nine villages including Chenyi and Fengyanzhuang, and five cadres and soldiers guarding the plane, by Kuomintang aircraft, as reported by Li Xuewen, Political Commissar of the Yongnian Brigade. U.S. Representative Olson recorded everything in a special form, and considered Political Commissar Li's report to be accurate, and asked Political Commissar Li to sign as a witness. He then went to Mazhuang Village to open the coffin and examine the body of Chai Guozhang, the deputy platoon leader who was killed in the bombing. He then inspected the damaged plane in the wheat field north of the village. The front half of the fuselage had completely melted, leaving only the wings and the rear half. Around the plane, there were bomb craters and traces of machine gun fire everywhere. Scattered among the wheat fields were fragments of shrapnel, pierced military caps of soldiers stained with fresh blood, and children's cloth shoes. Lieutenant Colonel Olson took photos of the damaged fuselage as evidence, and then rode to villages such as Chenyi and Qiji to inspect the injured residents and interview the families of the deceased. In Chenyi alone, twelve people were killed or injured, nine of whom were children aged six to fifteen. Lian Fulong's wife was picking wheat ears in the wheat field with her three children when a Kuomintang plane injured her eleven-year-old eldest daughter Tongfeng in the waist, her eight-year-old Zhimin in the leg, and blew off half of the foot of her six-year-old youngest daughter Xinfeng. When Colonel Olson was inspecting, Xinfeng was in unbearable pain and cried incessantly. Lian Fulong's wife grabbed the U.S. representative and repeatedly asked, "Why don't the Kuomintang planes bomb Wang Zemin, the traitor and local tyrant 'Iron Grinder' in Yongnian City, but instead bomb the people picking wheat ears?" Lian En's was only fifteen years old, and his father, Lian Wan, was blind. The family of five depended on him to pick up firewood and do farm work. His tragic death made it impossible for the whole family to survive. Lian Wan, leaning on his crutches, knelt before the horse of U.S. Representative Olson with his wife, crying about how his son's right leg and left arm were blown off and he died tragically. Lian Tongyi and his wife cried uncontrollably, grabbing the reins of the U.S. representative's translator, and questioning why the Kuomintang planes had blown open the belly of their eleven-year-old son, causing his intestines to flow out. Dozens of people knelt down to block the U.S. representative's way, their cries filling the fields. Witnessing this tragic scene, Lieutenant Colonel Olson couldn't help but shed tears. He immediately stated that the masses could elect representatives to petition the group. The village chief of Chenyi represented the masses and stated the demands: (1) Immediately disband the pseudo-bandits and traitors Iron Grinder and Wang Zemin in the city. (2) Request the Kuomintang to provide compensation and relief to the families of the deceased and wounded. (3) Guarantee that Kuomintang planes will not bomb and strafe peaceful residents in the future. Otherwise, the people of Yongnian will take self-defense actions. Lieutenant Colonel Olson promised to forward the details of this massacre to the Peiping Executive Headquarters for handling.
