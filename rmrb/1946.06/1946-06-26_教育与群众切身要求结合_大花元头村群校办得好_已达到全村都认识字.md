　　Integrating Education with the People's Needs
　　Dahuayuantou Village Runs Community Schools Well
　　Entire Village Now Literate
　　[Our newspaper, Weixian News] Due to the implementation of the new education policy, the school in Dahuayuantou Village, Guan County, has thoroughly integrated with families, production, and society, resulting in voluntary enrollment and significant achievements. The entire village has gone from two literate individuals to everyone being able to read. Generally, men can recite and write 350 characters, women in key groups can read newspapers, and women can write over 400 characters, greatly improving their political and cultural levels. The development process of the community schools: First, the influence of primary education. Because the teachers were dedicated to serving the people, they wrote their own teaching materials, taught during the day, wrote at night, and every afternoon led students in groups to collect manure, firewood, and push the mill. Under these circumstances, all boys and girls in the village enrolled in school. Second, development based on winter school. During the winter mornings, the government actively called on the masses to attend winter school, and assigned outstanding primary school children to participate in adult group guidance, which rapidly developed the winter school work and laid the foundation for community schools. Then, the political commentator, based on the village's educational progress and the people's level of awareness, proposed the transition from winter school to community schools. The village education committee visited the Wangzhuang community school and introduced its experiences and achievements to the masses, further stimulating and exciting them. The masses then voluntarily donated money to build school buildings, and all young men and women in the village eagerly signed up. According to the principle of voluntary association, groups were divided; some were organized according to the original winter groups, some according to production needs, and some were freely combined. Those with more literacy formed a basic group. A total of thirteen groups were formed among adults in the village, six male groups with forty-three people and seven female groups with fifty-three people. The groups were organized into two large teams, each with a captain. The leading group leaders adopted a self-edited, self-taught, mutual-teaching and mutual-learning teaching method. The content of the teaching materials mainly included current affairs issues, work focuses, and production knowledge. The materials were written based on the village's situation and suited the needs of the broad masses, and were also very accessible and easy to learn. For example, in the production knowledge materials, the women's production unit included a lesson: "Liu Shuxiang is truly praiseworthy, one show of skill spins five liang of cotton." The men's production unit included a lesson: "Out of the pigsty, dig ash pits, straw manure feeds wheat, ash soil and manure for peanuts," etc. Education method: Adult group leaders gathered at the school headquarters, coordinated with the young teachers and group leaders, and then went to the groups to teach. In management, they inspired students' self-awareness, guided students to help each other and supervise each other, and used democratic methods to discuss merits and demerits. The children's section planted ten mu of land to solve the difficulty of stationery and the lives of poor students. In addition, there was a cooperative, and the money earned generally solved the difficulties of the students.
