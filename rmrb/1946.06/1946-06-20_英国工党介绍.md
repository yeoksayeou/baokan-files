An Introduction to the British Labour Party
The British Labour Party is the current ruling party of the British Empire. It was founded in 1906, its predecessor being the "Labour Representation Committee" formed in 1900. From its inception, the Labour Party, in terms of its class composition, was "not a working-class party, but a party of alliance between workers and the urban petty bourgeoisie."

According to Stalin's remarks on May 13, 1927: "After the First World War, the nature of the Labour Party underwent new changes due to the joining of many Liberals. Especially after the formation of MacDonald's first Labour cabinet in 1924, the worker aristocrats and bureaucrats who controlled the party consistently pursued a policy of compromise, making the Labour Party in effect an appendage of the British big bourgeoisie, serving its interests."

The Labour Party's political platform is expressed in its official program published in 1919, the Labour Report, and "The New Social Order." This program touts "socialism" on the one hand, while advocating social reform and opposing revolution on the other. The deceased Labour leader MacDonald said in his book "Socialism": "The driving force of socialism is not struggle, but the rejection of struggle based on imagined wisdom and moral concepts." The "socialism" chanted by the Labour Party once blinded a considerable number of working masses and gained their support. In 1920, the Labour Party had more than 4,370,000 members, which was the party's heyday. However, due to the Labour Party's continuous betrayal of the interests of the working class in policy and action, the working masses gradually lost their illusions about it and left it, causing the Labour Party's strength to gradually weaken. From 1920 to the 26th year of the current annual meeting, the number of Labour Party members has not only not increased, but has instead decreased to 3,289,000.

The Labour Party has been in power four times in Britain: The first time was on January 12, 1924, when the Labour Party formed the MacDonald cabinet. The main domestic policies touted by the Labour Party included the nationalization of railways, mines, etc., and commercial capital taxes, etc., but none of them were implemented. As a result, the MacDonald cabinet only existed for nine months and fifteen days before it collapsed.

The second time was in May 1929. At that time, unemployment in Britain was serious, and the Indian national movement was in full swing. The Labour Party took the realization of socialism, the solution and relief of unemployment, and "allowing India's independence" as its campaign platform, resulting in the formation of the second Labour cabinet headed by MacDonald. After MacDonald came to power again, he violated his promise to give India independence and sent troops to suppress the Indian national movement. At the same time, the set of reform measures he took could not solve the then serious economic panic and unemployment crisis. In 1931, MacDonald, in the National Cabinet organized by the Conservative Party, formed the "National Labour Party." The so-called orthodox Labour Party, led by Attlee, Bevin, Greenwood, etc., then stood in the position of the opposition party. However, during this period, the leading organs of the so-called opposition Labour Party still strongly supported the government. They expressed active support for the government's non-intervention policy in Spain, the Munich policy, and the policy of condoning fascism. In the House of Commons foreign policy debate on April 7, 1939, Greenwood, one of the Labour Party leaders, praised Chamberlain for "implementing the Labour Party's 'collective security' policy." At the end of May, the Labour Party Congress rejected the proposal for a general strike and non-cooperation with the government.

The third time was on May 11, 1940, when it participated in Churchill's wartime coalition cabinet, which was dominated by the Conservative Party. During this period, the British government, while implementing a progressive policy of anti-Hitler fascist war, continued its reactionary imperialist policy. On the latter issue, Churchill also received the cooperation of the Labour Party. The main example is that Morrison, one of the Labour Party leaders, released the British fascist leader Mosley in the autumn of 1943. In the winter of 1944, the Labour Party leadership supported the government's Scobie policy in Greece. When the Labour Party annual meeting debated the Greek issue in December of the same year, Bevin openly defended Churchill's policy, saying: "The steps taken by the government were not Churchill's personal decision. My colleagues and I all participated in this discussion, so any other decisions we take are wrong."

The fourth time was on July 26, 1945, when the current Labour Party's Attlee cabinet was formed. During this period, especially in the early days of the victory of the war, the domestic and foreign policies implemented by the Labour government were the same as those of the Churchill cabinet: externally, it advocated the organization of a Western European group, and for the colonies, it still insisted on the imperialist policy; in domestic affairs, it continued the policy of serving the interests of the big bourgeoisie. Since the end of last year, the Labour government, in view of the serious economic difficulties of the British Empire, has also taken some reform measures that are slightly different from those of the Conservative Party, such as passing the nationalization bills of banks, mines, etc., but this is not the implementation of so-called "socialism," but the further enhancement of the private ownership of the big bourgeoisie. The nationalization plan of the Bank of England is one example. The interest on the bank's past shares was 12 percent. The so-called "nationalization" is that the government buys it with four times the original shares and pays interest for 20 years at a rate of 3 percent. Because the capital has increased four times, the interest is still 12 percent. At the same time, the bank has had the potential to control other banks in the past. After nationalization, it has legalized its power, and the bank's personnel have not changed. The directors are still appointed by the British Emperor, and the control is still in the hands of the big bourgeoisie. The first governor of the bank after nationalization said: "Rather than saying this is a revolution, it is better to say it is an evolution. The Bank of England is performing an operation, and I trust the skills and knowledge of the doctor performing this operation." Bevin's foreign policy still follows the original policy set by the Conservative Party, and thus has won the full support of the Conservative Party leader Churchill. On the 5th of this month, Churchill made a speech in the House of Commons foreign policy debate, saying: "Bevin is completely trustworthy."

What must be especially pointed out is that the Labour Party leadership has consistently adopted a policy of anti-communism and non-cooperation with other progressive parties since 1924 until now. Since its founding in 1921, the British Communist Party has adopted a policy of uniting with the Labour Party and demanding to join the Labour Party in order to unite and unify the strength of the working class and promote the progress of the Labour Party. The British Communist Party has made 12 requests to the Labour Party to join, but they have all been stubbornly rejected by the Labour Party leadership, which has hindered the further unity and strengthening of the organized labor force in Britain. However, due to the expanding influence of the British Communist Party's prestige among the workers, the number of groups and individuals within the Labour Party who advocate joining the British Communist Party has been increasing day by day. In the Labour Party Congress in June 1943, although the proposal to join the British Communist Party was rejected once again, the latter's voting ratio was 1,951,000 votes to 712,000 votes. At present, there are as many as 1,016 trade unions and groups that support the British Communist Party's joining the Labour Party, which shows that the force supporting the British Communist Party's joining the Labour Party is not small.

Due to the Labour Party's long-term persistence in this backward policy that violates the interests of the working class, it has not only caused disappointment among the broad masses of the British people, but also caused dissatisfaction among the left-wing leaders and the broad masses of party members. As early as after 1931, the Independent Labour Party, the Public Security Party, etc. have separated, and the number of individual party members and group party members who have voluntarily withdrawn has been increasing day by day. In 1937 and 1943, individual party members decreased from 447,000 to 225,000, and group party members decreased from 51 units to 42 units. Now there are three factions in the Labour Party: the center, the left, and the right. The right wing is represented by Attlee, Morrison, and Bevin, the center wing is represented by Cripps, and the left wing is represented by Shinwell and more than 30 members of the House of Commons (they are called the Communists in the Labour Party). Laski can generally be said to be the left wing. The progressive forces within the Labour Party are growing, but they cannot change the ruling position of the right-wing leaders in the party. These right-wing leaders occupy the leadership organs of the major trade unions and the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party (although the chairman of the committee is Laski). They can still exert influence on a considerable part of British workers. However, with the development of history, when the current policy of the Labour Party leadership inevitably fails and its class essence has been exposed, the broad masses of British workers will inevitably wake up.

    英国工党介绍
    英国工党是目前英帝国的执政党，成立于一九○六年，其前身为一九○○年组成的“劳工代表委员会”。工党从其成立之时起，按其阶级成份来说，便“不是一个工人阶级的政党，而是一个工人与城市小资产阶级联盟的政党”。
    据一九二七年五月十三日斯大林谈话：“第一次大战后，由于许多自由党人的加入工党，使工党的性质发生了新变化，特别从一九二四年麦克唐纳第一届工党内阁组成以后，由于掌握该党大权的工人贵族和官僚分子，一贯执行着妥协政策，使工党实际上变成了英国大资产阶级的附庸，并为其利益而服务。”
    工党的政治主张，表现在它一九一九年发表的正式纲领与劳工报及“新社会秩序”中，该纲领一面标榜“社会主义”，一面在主张社会改良，而反对革命。已去世的工党领袖麦克唐纳在其所著“社会主义”一书中曾说：“社会主义的动力不是斗争，而是依想象的智慧和道德的观念排斥斗争”。工党所高唱的“社会主义”，曾蒙蔽了相当数量的劳工大众，曾获得了他们的拥护。一九二○年工党拥有党员四百三十七万余人，为工党的全盛时期。但由于工党在政策与行动上不断背叛工人阶级的利益，使劳工大众逐渐消失了对它的幻想，而离开了它，使工党的力量逐渐削弱。从一九二○年至本届年会召开的二十六年中，工党党员不仅没有增加，相反却减少至三百二十八万九千人。
    工党在英国曾四次执政：第一次在一九二四年一月十二日工党组织麦克唐纳内阁，工党所标榜的主要内政政策，包括铁路、矿山等国有化，商业资本税等，但均未实行，结果麦克唐纳内阁仅存在了九个月零十五天就倒台了。
    第二次是在一九二九年五月，当时英国内失业问题严重，印度民族运动则正风起云涌，工党即以实现社会主义，解决与救济失业“允许印度独立”作为竞选纲领，结果达成了以麦克唐纳为首的第二次工党内阁。麦氏再度上台后，即违背给印度独立的诺言，调兵遣将，镇压印度民族运动。同时，他所采取的一套改良办法，并不能解决当时严重的经济恐慌和失业危机。一九三一年，麦克唐纳在保守党组织的国民内阁中，另组织“国民工党”，以艾德礼、贝文、格林伍德等领导的所谓正统派工党，这时就站在在野党地位。但是在这一时期内，所谓在野党的工党的领导机关，仍极力支持政府。对政府的对西班牙不干涉政策，慕尼黑政策与纵容法西斯政策，表示积极声援。一九三九年四月七日的下院外交辩论中，工党领袖之一格林伍德称颂张伯伦“已在实施工党的‘集体安全’政策”。五月底，工党代表大会，又否决了总罢工和不与政府合作的建议。
    第三次是一九四○年五月十一日，参加保守党占优势的邱吉尔战时联合内阁。这一时期，英政府虽一方面实行了反希特勒法西斯战争的进步政策，一方面则仍继续帝国主义的反动政策。在后一问题上，邱吉尔同样是获得了工党的合作。主要者如工党领袖之一的摩理逊内相，于一九四三年秋释放了英法西斯头子莫斯莱。四四年冬，工党领导机关又支持了政府对希腊的斯科比政策。当同年十二月工党年会对希腊问题辩论时，贝文竟公开为邱吉尔政策辩护称：“政府所采取的步骤，并非邱吉尔个人的决定，我与我的同僚皆参加此种讨论，故我人另外采取的任何决定是错误的”。
    第四次是一九四五年七月二十六日所组成的，即目前的工党一党的艾德礼内阁。在这一时期内，特别在战争胜利结束初期，工党政府所实行的内外政策，与邱吉尔内阁一样，对外主张组织西欧集团，对殖民地则仍坚持帝国主义政策；在内政方面，继续为大资产阶级利益服务的方针。从去年底来，工党政府鉴于英帝国的严重的经济困难，也采取一些稍与保守党不同的改良办法，如通过了银行、矿山等国有化法案，但这并非实行所谓“社会主义”，而是更增强大资产阶级的私有权，英格兰银行国有计划即为一例。该银行过去股份的利息为百分之十二，所谓“国有化”，即由政府以四倍于原有股份的钱购买之，并付以二十年利息，利率为百分之三，因股本增至四倍，故利息仍旧是百分之十二；同时该行过去就具有支配其他银行的潜在力，国有化后，更把它的权力合法化了，而且该行的人事并未变动，董事仍由英皇任命，支配权仍掌握在大资产阶级手中，该行国有化后的首任行长并表示说：“与其说这是革命，不如说是一种演化，英格兰银行在施行一种手术，我对施行这种手术的医生的技术与智识是信任的”。贝文的外交政策，仍遵循着保守党的原定方针，因而获得保守党头子邱吉尔的充分支持。本月五日，邱吉尔在下院外交辩论时发表演说称：“贝文是值得完全信赖”。
    尤其必须指出的，工党领导机关自一九二四年以来直到现在，一贯采取排共反共以及不与其他进步党派合作的政策。英共自一九二一年创立时起，即采取联合工党，和要求参加工党的政策，以便团结与统一工人阶级的力量，并推动工党前进的英共已十二次向工党提出要求加入，但均遭工党领导机关顽固的拒绝，以致妨碍了英国有组织工人力量的进一步的团结与增强。但是由于英共的威信在工人中影响的扩大，在工党内部主张英共加入的团体与个人的数量已日增。一九四三年六月工党大会中，虽再一次否决了英共加入工党的提议，但后者投票的比例为一、九五一、○○○票对七一二、○○○票，目前赞成英共加入工党的职工会及团体达一千○十六个之多，可见拥护英共加入工党的力量是不小的。
    由于工党长期固执这种违反工人阶级利益的倒退政策，不仅引起英国广大人民的失望，而且引起了党内左派领袖及广大党员的不满，远在一九三一年以后，独立工党、公安党等均分离出去，个别党员与团体党员自动退出的日益增加。一九三七年与一九四三年，个别党员由四十四万七千人减至二十二万五千人，团体党员则由五十一个单位减至四十二个单位。现在工党内部则存在着中、左、右三派，右派以艾德礼、摩理逊、贝文等为代表，中派以克里浦斯为代表，左派以辛威尔及下院的三十余位议员（他们被称为工党中的共产党）为代表，拉斯基大致上可以说是左派。工党内的进步力量正在生长，但还不能改变右派领袖在党内的统治地位，这些右派领袖盘据着各大职工会的领导机关和工党的全国执行委员会，虽然该委员会的主席是拉斯基），他们仍能在相当部分的英国工人中发生影响。然而随着历史的发展，当工党领导机关的现行政策不可避免的走不通，其阶级本质已予暴露出来的时候，英国广大工人群众必然觉醒过来。
