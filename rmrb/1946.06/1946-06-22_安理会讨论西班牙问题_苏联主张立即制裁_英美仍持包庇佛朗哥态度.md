　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: New York dispatch: The United Nations Security Council convened a meeting at 2:30 PM on the 17th to discuss the Spanish Franco problem. The US representative put forward a delaying plan, advocating that no action be taken at present, but that the issue be left to the United Nations General Assembly to be held in September, for it to take measures it deems necessary. The US representative only considered the Franco regime to be a "potential threat" to world peace. The British representative even considered this delaying plan to be "too far-reaching." The Soviet representative, Gromyko, considered it not forceful enough and insisted that the Security Council should take immediate action against the Franco regime. At the meeting on the 18th, the British representative proposed an amendment to the US proposal, that it would be sufficient to submit the Spanish issue to the United Nations General Assembly in September, without making any supplementary recommendations. According to the British representative, the Franco regime is a domestic issue, and the United Nations has no right to interfere. The Soviet representative vehemently criticized the British opinion. When Pravda observed and commented on this matter, it stated: Only the voice of the Soviet representative is calling for the defense of the Spanish people and the cause of democracy and peace. Hearst newspaper observer, Pegler, clearly showed the attitude of some British and American figures toward the Spanish issue. Pegler claimed: Preserving "anti-communist Spain" is necessary for "obtaining a good bridgehead," and "from this bridgehead, Western civilization may be able to invade the East."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: New York dispatch: The "Now Liberate Spain" Committee here issued a statement on the Security Council's handling of the Spanish issue, stating: If the Security Council delays sanctions against Franco, it will allow Franco to calmly further consolidate his terrorist fascist dictatorship. This kind of resolution will give Franco another chance to breathe when the Spanish people are challenging fascist terror and the fascist regime. The statement concludes: Any delay at present can only encourage the Franco regime's ambitions for aggression. Those who signed this statement include New York City Councilor, journalist Schirer, American All-Slavic Congress Vice Chairman Balaksovich, pianist Leaf, artists Keith and Keshav, etc.

　　安理会讨论西班牙问题
    苏联主张立即制裁
    英美仍持包庇佛朗哥态度
    【新华社延安十九日电】纽约讯：联合国安全理事会，于十七日下午二时三十分开会，讨论西班牙佛朗哥问题。美国代表提出拖延计划，主张目前不采取行动，而将问题留交九月间举行的联合国全体大会，由其采取认为必要的措施。美代表仅认为佛朗哥政权，只是对世界和平的一个“潜在的威胁”。对于这个拖延计划，英代表还认为“过于远大”。苏代表葛罗米柯则认为不够有力，坚持安理会应对佛朗哥政权立即采取行动。十八日会议上，英代表提出对美建议的修正案，即将西班牙问题提交九月的联合国大会就够了，而不必作任何补充建议。按英代表认为：佛朗哥政权是国内问题，联合国无权干涉。苏代表猛烈抨击英国的意见，真理报观察后评论此事时称：只有苏代表的声音，为保卫西班牙人民保卫民主与和平事业而呼吁。美国赫斯特系报纸观察家，皮格勒明白显示某些英美人士对西班牙问题的态度，皮氏声称：保存“反共的西班牙”，对于“获得一个好的桥头阵地”，乃是必须的，“从这个桥头阵地，西方文明便可能向东方侵袭”。
    【新华社延安十九日电】纽约讯：此间“现在解放西班牙”委员会，对安全理事会处理西班牙问题，发表声明称：如果安理会迟延制裁佛朗哥，将使佛朗哥能从容地更加巩固其恐怖法西斯独裁。此种决议，将在西班牙人民向法西斯恐怖与法西斯政权挑战之时，给佛朗哥另一次喘气的机会。声明结语称：目前任何迟延，只能激励佛朗哥政权侵略之野心。签名于此声明者，有纽约市议会议员、记者席勒尔，美国全斯拉夫大会副主席巴拉克索维区，钢琴家李夫，艺术家克维思及克沙夫等。
