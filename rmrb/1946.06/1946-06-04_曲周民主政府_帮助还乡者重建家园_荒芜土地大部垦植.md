    Quzhou Democratic Government
    Helps Returning Residents Rebuild Homes
    Large Part of Barren Land Cultivated
    [Our Newspaper] Jinnan's Quzhou, after eight years of enemy disaster and four years of natural disaster, has seen the democratic government, after liberation, call on returning residents to help rebuild their homes. The masses have new hope. Nine months of effort have resulted in the cultivation of one-half of the nearly entirely barren land. They are engaged in production under unimaginable difficult conditions. The mutual aid team led by Shi Changxiu of Beisitou Village has only two hoes and four sickles for several laborers to use in rotation. They have nothing to eat, relying only on selling clothes and furniture that are not urgently needed for agricultural production and some government loans to solve the problem. Before spring, they sold all their single-layer clothing. Now they work bare-backed in the fields during the day but wear lined clothing back home at night. Longtang Village originally had more than 200 households and more than 600 people. The village of thirty qing of land had only two small merchants and their two donkeys when it was first liberated. Later, people returned from the old liberated areas and areas outside the liberated areas, and now there are half the original families and one-third of the population. The government loaned them money to buy two cows and two large new hoes. In the fervor of rebuilding their homes, even the old ladies have joined the land reclamation wave. Half of the village's land has been reclaimed. In addition to engaging in reclamation, the women have also bought new spinning wheels to spin cotton. Recently, the government further resolved the difficulties in the Longtang area and allocated another 100,000 jin of rice for emergency relief.

    曲周民主政府
    帮助还乡者重建家园
    荒芜土地大部垦植
    【本报讯】经八年敌灾四年天灾之冀南曲周，解放后，民主政府号召还乡帮助重新建立家务，群众已有新生希望，九个月的努力，使几乎全部荒芜的土地，新垦面积达二分之一，他们在吾人不可想像的困难条件下，进行生产，北寺头村石长秀领导的互助组上个劳动力，只有两张锄、四张镰，替换使用。没有吃的，只靠卖些当前从事农业生产所不急需的衣物家俱和政府部分贷款来解决，春前他们把单衣卖光了，现在他们白天光着背在地里耕作，晚上却穿着夹衣回去。龙堂村原为二百多户，六百余人，三十顷地的村子，刚解放时，只有两家小商人和他们的两头驴。以后，从老解放区和解放区以外地区赶回来，现在已有原来的一半人家和三分之一的人口了，政府贷款给他们买了两头牛，两张大新锄，在重新建立家园的狂热中老太太也卷入开荒浪潮。该村土地已开出一半，妇女们除从事开垦外，还买了新纺车纺花，最近政府进一步解决龙堂区的困难，又拨了十万斤米进行急赈。
