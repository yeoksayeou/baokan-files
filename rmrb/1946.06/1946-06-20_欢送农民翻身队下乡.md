    Welcoming the Peasants' Emancipation Teams to the Countryside
    In order to thoroughly implement the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses and to rapidly mobilize the broad masses, the Peasants' Emancipation Teams, jointly formed by the Central Bureau, the Military Region, and the Border Region, after half a month of intensive study, are now heading to the newly liberated areas near Handan with high enthusiasm to help the people carry out the cause of emancipation. This is of great significance for promoting the movement of boldly and fully mobilizing the broad masses of people throughout the Border Region. Here, we extend our highest respect to all comrades of the Emancipation Teams and wish the victory of the emancipation cause of the broad masses of people throughout the Border Region, who have been oppressed by feudal forces for thousands of years and ravaged by the enemy and puppets for eight years!
    Mobilizing the masses is the central link of all work. This has been deeply proven by the past eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the current struggle for peace and democracy. For more than half a year, in various parts of the Border Region, due to the leadership's recognition of the importance of this work, significant achievements have been made in mobilizing the masses to carry out the struggle against traitors and the liquidation of their property, as well as rent reduction and interest rate reduction. However, we have not yet fully mobilized the broad masses of people to completely liberate them from the suffering of feudal oppression and exploitation, to satisfy the vital interests and demands of the broad masses, and to lay a solid foundation for the Border Region's people's democratic construction, anti-treachery and self-defense, and have not yet met the required standards. The scale and depth of the movement, whether in the mountains or on the plains, are still insufficient. Although there are many reasons for this, the main reason is still the leadership's failure to let go sufficiently, and the failure to seize the time tightly enough. The average distribution of forces, without concentrating on breaking through, also limits the development of the operations. Now, the Border Region-level leading organs are transferring a large number of cadres, concentrating forces, organizing peasant emancipation teams, and implementing short-term training, seizing the time, and promoting the implementation of this central task with the greatest determination. This kind of courage and determination sets an example for the entire Border Region. Leaders at all levels should deeply understand this spirit, and, in conjunction with production, conscientiously strive for time (breaking the idea of waiting for further development this winter), concentrate forces (do not emphasize systematic work and average the use of forces), transfer more cadres, form countless large and small peasant emancipation teams, boldly and resolutely, quickly and universally mobilize the masses, so that the masses in every corner of the Border Region dare to be fully mobilized in the shortest period of time.
    During the study period, the comrades of the Emancipation Teams have clarified the above-mentioned spirit due to the personal instructions of the leaders, and have realized that helping the masses to emancipate themselves by the people's army and cadres is the most important task in the current revolutionary task. They have established the concept of dedicating themselves to the cause of the people's emancipation, and have unlimited determination and confidence in participating in the mass movement. Now that everyone is setting off with this determination, it is hoped that everyone will be able to respond well to the call of Commander Liu, Political Commissar Deng, Chairman Yang, and Deputy Political Commissar Bo: "To implement the land policy with enthusiastic and down-to-earth methods," to put what they have learned during the study period into practice in the mass movement, and for every comrade to keep their eyes downward, take the mass line, humbly learn from the masses, and be good at concentrating the opinions of the broad masses. Boldly and decisively support the masses and take charge of their affairs, let the mass movement be implemented thoroughly, cherish the creativity of the masses, and promote the wisdom of the masses. The work can certainly be done well.
    The masses in the newly liberated areas are eagerly demanding emancipation. They are full of grievances and want to pour them out, just like a volcano of hatred. As long as it is ignited, the raging fire of anti-traitor revenge, rent reduction and interest rate reduction will erupt. This flame has already been ignited in many places, and some are about to be ignited. Because the masses have been oppressed for a long time and cannot turn themselves over, once they take action, it will inevitably be extremely fierce. We must support this action of the broad masses with great enthusiasm in order to remove all the ideological, political, and economic shackles imposed on the people by thousands of years of feudal rule and eight years of enemy and puppet rule. Do not be restrained in any way.
    Comrades of the Emancipation Teams, go ahead, thousands of oppressed hands are reaching out to you, hoping that you will gloriously complete this historical and important mission. (Attached picture)

    欢送农民翻身队下乡
    为了彻底执行大胆放手发动群众的方针，把广大群众迅速发动起来，中央局、军区、边区共同组成的农民翻身队，经过半月的紧张学习，现以高度的热忱，前往邯郸附近新解放区，帮助人民进行翻身的事业了。这对推动全边区大胆放手充分发动广大群众的运动，是一件有重大意义的事。我们在此，向所有翻身队的同志们，特致崇高的敬意，并预祝全边区几千年来被封建势力压榨与八年来受尽敌伪摧残的广大人民翻身事业的胜利！
    发动群众是一切工作的中心环节，从过去八年抗日战争中及目前和平民主斗争中已深深的证明了，半年多以来，全边区各地，由于领导上认识了这一工作的重要，在发动群众进行反奸清算、减租减息的工作上，已经获得了显著成绩，但我们充分发动广大群众，让他们彻底从封建压迫与剥削的痛苦中解放出来，满足广大群众的切身利益与要求，打下边区人民民主建设防奸自卫的坚实基础，都还未能达到应有的要求，运动的规模的深度，不论在山地，在平原，都仍然是不够的。究其原因虽多，但主要的仍在于领导上的放手的不展，而对时间上抓的不够紧，平均分用力量，没有集中去突击，也营运处的开展以不少限制。现边区级领导机关，抽调大批干部，集中力量，组织农民翻身队，并施行短期训练，抓紧时间，以最大决心来推动贯彻这一中心工作。这种魄力与决心，给全边区树立了楷模，各级领导机关应深深体会这一精神，在与生产相结合的情形下，认真争取时间（打破等待今冬再发展的想法），集中力量（不要强调系统工作平均使用力量），抽调更多的干部，组成无数的大大小小的农民翻身队，大胆放手，坚决、迅速、普遍的发动群众，使全边区各个角落的群众都敢于最短期间获得充分发动。
    翻身队的同志，在学习期中，对上述精神，由于各首长亲临指示，已经明确起来，并认识了人民的军队和干部帮助群众翻身事业，是当前革命任务中头等重要的工作，树立了为人民翻身事业献身的观念，对参加群运都抱了无限的决心与信心，现在大家带着这个决心出发了，希望大家都能很好的响应刘司令员、邓政委、杨主席、薄副政委的号召：“要以热情踏实的作法，贯彻执行土地政策”，将在学习期间的东西，拿在群运中去实践，每个同志做到眼睛向下走群众路线，虚心向群众学习，而且善于把广大群众的意见集中起来。大胆放手为群众撑腰作主，让群运贯彻下去，珍贵群众的创造，发扬群众的智慧，工作是一定可以做好的。
    新解放区的群众，迫切要求翻身，他们满怀冤屈要求倾吐，正象一座仇恨的火山，只要经过点燃，反奸复仇、减租减息的熊熊烈火，就会爆出烈焰。这烈焰，很多地方已经燃烧起来了，有些将要燃烧起来。由于群众久被压榨翻不过身来，一经行动起来，必然是极猛烈的，对广大农民的这种行动，我们要以极大的热情去赞助他们，以解除几千年来封建统治及敌伪八年来所加诸人民的思想上、政治上、经济上的一切枷锁，千万不可有任何束手束脚。
    翻身队同志们，去吧，千万只被压榨的手正在伸向你们，希望你们光荣的完成这次历史性的重大使命。（附图片）
