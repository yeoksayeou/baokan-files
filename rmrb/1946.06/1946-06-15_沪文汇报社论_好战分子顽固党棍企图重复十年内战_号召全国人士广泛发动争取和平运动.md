Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 11th: The Shanghai Wenhui Daily published an editorial entitled "Peace Movement" on May 28th, stating: "The current situation is at a critical juncture, with three paths laid out before us: The first is to immediately cease fire, restore peace, and embark on the road of democratic construction; the second is to continue the civil war, expand the civil war, and repeat the tragedy of the so-called 'Communist suppression' of the past decade; the third is to talk and fight simultaneously, delaying again and again. The path of delay is a path of defeatism. Some foreign individuals hope to delay, and even help create a situation of delay, because they want to use China as the outpost, or even the battlefield, of a Third World War. They do not regard China as a country, but as a strategic base; they do not regard the Chinese people as human beings, but as cannon fodder in their wars. As for repeating the old path of the ten-year civil war, it is advocated by warmongering militarists and stubborn, narrow-minded party cliques. Frankly speaking, neither the Kuomintang nor the Communist Party has the ability to quickly eliminate the other. If the Kuomintang army is stronger than it was ten years ago, so is the Communist army. Even the highly skilled Japanese invaders could not eliminate the Communist army, and today's National Army may not be able to succeed. Therefore, only the first path, to immediately cease fire, restore peace, and embark on the road of democratic construction, is in line with the interests of all Chinese people. All sectors of Shanghai and China, including workers, peasants, merchants, students, cultural circles, and other people's organizations, should launch a broad, nationwide "peace movement" to stop the civil war using the people's own methods."

    沪文汇报社论
    好战分子顽固党棍企图重复十年内战
    号召全国人士广泛发动争取和平运动
    【新华社延安十一日电】五月二十八日的上海文汇报，以“和平运动”为题，发表社论说：“目前时局正处在严重关头，摆在面前的道路有三条：第一条是立刻停战，恢复和平，走上民主建设的大道；第二条是继续内战，扩大内战，重演十年所谓“剿共”的悲剧；第三条是一面谈，一面战，拖延复拖延。拖的道路是失败主义的道路，某些外国人士希望拖，甚至帮忙制造拖的局面，因为他们想把中国作为第三次世界大战的前哨，甚至是战场，他们没有把中国当成一个国家，而是当成一种战略基地，他们没有把中国人当作人看，而是当成他们在战争的炮灰。至于重复十年内战的老路，是黩武主义的好战分子和顽固狭隘的党棍们所主张的。老实说，国共两党谁都没有迅速消灭对方的可能，假如国民党军比十年前强大了，共产党军也是一样，日寇那样的善战，尚且消灭不了共产党军队，今天的国军更未必能够成功。所以说，只有第一条立即停战，恢复和平，走上民主建设的道路，才是符合全中国人民利益的道路，全上海、全中国的工、农、商、学、文化各界，以及其他的人民团体，应发动广泛的全国性的“争取和平运动”，用人民自己的办法来制止内战。
