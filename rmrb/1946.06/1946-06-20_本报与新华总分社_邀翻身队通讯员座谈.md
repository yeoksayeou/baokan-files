    This Newspaper and Xinhua News Agency Headquarters
    Invite Turned-Over Team Correspondents to a Forum

    [This Newspaper News] To promptly and effectively report on the peasant emancipation movement after the county-level peasant emancipation teams went to the countryside, this newspaper and Xinhua News Agency Headquarters organized communication work during the study period of the peasant emancipation teams. Many comrades who participated in the emancipation teams voluntarily signed up as correspondents for this newspaper and frequently discussed mass movement reporting issues with comrades from this newspaper who were participating in the emancipation teams. On the afternoon of the 13th, this newspaper and Xinhua News Agency Headquarters prepared refreshments and invited the correspondents of the emancipation teams to hold a forum, attended by more than 40 people. Everyone enthusiastically spoke on issues such as how to report after going to the countryside, believing that reporting on the mass movement is part of the mass movement work and is the due obligation of every comrade participating in the emancipation team. They all expressed their willingness to report, in their work, on the problems existing in the local mass movement, the experiences of success and failure, the suffering of the peasants before emancipation from the destruction and exploitation of enemy and puppet remnants and feudal rule, how the peasants united to carry out struggles, and the new life of the peasants after emancipation, in a typical and continuous manner. Secondly, there was a discussion on how to collect materials and writing methods, reviewing that past reports on the mass movement were often generalized. This time, materials should be collected at any time and place, collectively researched and written, and the reporting format need not be limited to news, but can be in the form of communications, reports, stories, work research, etc.

    【本报讯】为了及时有力的报导此次边区级农民翻身队下乡后的农民翻身运动，本报与新华总分社曾在农民翻身队的学习期中，进行通讯工作的组织，参加翻身队的同志们，多自动报名作本报的通讯员，并经常与本报参加翻身队的同志，研究群运报导问题。十三日下午，本报与新华总分社曾备茶点，邀翻身队的通讯员举行座谈，到会四十余人，大家对下乡后怎样报导等问题，均踊跃发言，认为报导群运是群运工作的一部分，是每个参加翻身队同志的应尽义务，都愿在工作中，把当地群运中所存在的问题，成功与失败的经验，农民在翻身前所受敌伪残余势力及封建统治的摧残与剥削的痛苦，农民怎样团结起来进行斗争，以及农民翻身后的新生活等，作典型连续的报导。其次是对如何搜集材料及写作方法的讨论，检讨过去群运的报导，多陷一般化，这次要随时随地搜集材料、集体研究与写作，报导形式不必尽用新闻，可按通讯、报告、故事、工作研究等形式。
