　　[This report from Yangcheng] Zhao Meiying, a female labor hero from Fancun, Second District of Fushan, actively leads the women in her village to carry out labor mutual aid. At the beginning of the first lunar month this year, she first organized 67 women in the village. In three months, they spun a total of 1,400 catties of cotton, earning 500 catties of cotton; and wove 800 chi of cloth. Every member of the spinning and weaving group changed into a new set of summer clothes, and there were still 344 chi of cloth left over. When the spring plowing began, they cooperated with the men's mutual aid groups to carry out work such as hoeing and delivering manure. In this way, the mutual aid group expanded from 67 people to 120 people. In addition to spinning and weaving, they plowed 500 mu of land, hoed wheat on 524 mu, carried 2,000 loads of manure, and opened up 234 mu of wasteland. The villagers praised, "Now women have come of age—they are really as tall as men." When hoeing seedlings began, they all turned to hoeing seedlings. The mutual aid group expanded by 14 small groups, totaling 67 people. In this way, 50 percent of the female labor force in the whole village was organized. There are two main reasons for achieving such results: (1) They can arrange work at any time according to the central work in the countryside and the needs of the women. (2) The method of assigning work is good. For example, when hoeing seedlings, the old ladies hoe slower, so they are counted as one work unit, while the young women hoe faster, so they are counted as one and a half work units. In this way, everyone's production enthusiasm is very high. They hoed 1,300 mu of seedlings in ten days. Recently, the whole group held a meeting and especially emphasized deep plowing and careful cultivation. They proposed a competition with the men's mutual aid group, requiring that cotton be hoeed five times, and golden empress corn and millet be hoeed three times. During the hot season, they will cut artemisia and collect manure to ensure an increase of four sheng of refined grain per mu, so that the whole group can achieve "cultivating three, saving one."

　　女英雄赵美英领导得力
    范村妇女积极互助
    她们向男人竞赛，争取全组做到耕三余一
    【本报阳城讯】浮山二区范村女劳动英雄赵美英，积极领导本村妇女开展劳动互助，今年阴历正月初，先将本村六十七个妇女组织起来，进行组织，三个月中，共纺花一千四百斤，赚花五百斤；织布八百尺，纺织组每人夏季都换了一件新衣服，还余布三百四十四尺。春耕开始时他们配合男互助组，进行锄地、送粪等工作，这样互助组又由六十七人扩大到一百二十人，除纺花织布外，共犁地五百亩，锄麦五百二十四亩，担粪两千担，开荒二百三十四亩，还给抗属种地五十亩，村人均称赞说：“如今妇女成人啦—真和男人一样高”。锄苗开始她们又全部转入锄苗中，互助组在锄苗中又扩大十四个小组，共六十七人，这样全村妇女劳动力百分之五十都组织起来。取得这样成绩的主要原因有二：（一）能按照农村中的中心工作及妇女们的需要而随时按排工作。（二）配工办法好。如锄苗时老太太锄的较慢，她们便算一个工，年青妇女锄的快，便算一个半工。这样大家生产情绪均很高。十天内便锄苗一千三百亩。最近全组开会时特别强调深耕细作，她们和男互助组提出竞赛，要做到棉花锄五遍，金皇后玉茭、谷子都锄三遍，伏天割蒿汇粪、保证争取每亩增细粮四升，使全组达到耕三余一。
