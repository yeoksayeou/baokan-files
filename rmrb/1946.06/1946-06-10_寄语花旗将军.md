A Message to General Gillem

Moye

"Under the glass window on the right corner of the auditorium's front, there was an even more touching scene: the Chairman's wife and Mrs. Marshall, sitting around a round table. Marshall, in a very relaxed posture, rested his hands on the backs of the two ladies' sofas as they talked. The laughter from this corner was continuous, forming the highest note in the general joy of the important delegation." (May 10th, Peiping National News, "Record of the May Fifth Tea Party")

This journalist is truly a master of sketching. With just a few lines, he not only set off the "grand occasion" of the "Return to the Capital Ceremony" but also depicted the "close friendship between the two major allies, China and the United States," in a "just right" manner. Undoubtedly, this is indeed a "more touching scene," but "more touching scenes" are not limited to this one.

"The number of incidents of American soldiers in Tianjin drinking and causing trouble has increased... Now, in addition to causing trouble in dance halls and hotels, they have changed their methods, moving the scenes of their disturbances to the streets and alleys. After ten o'clock every night, their drunken roars can be heard anytime and anywhere. People riding rickshaws and pedicabs are often beaten, and the rickshaw and pedicab drivers are often beaten until they vomit blood, and sometimes they don't get paid after pulling for a long time. Therefore, there are very few vehicles in Tianjin that specifically wait for American soldiers now. In recent days, the number of people beaten by drunken American soldiers is the highest. Some time ago, a traffic policeman was beaten to death by them... The order today is even more chaotic. They smashed a rice shop, messed up a department store, and injured many people..." (February 8th, Shanghai Zhengyan Daily)

"...Therefore, the wives and daughters of the gentlemen and ladies, in order to show preferential treatment to the Allied forces, might as well make an exception and have a public social gathering to promote 'diplomatic relations.' American soldiers appear particularly 'lively' on these occasions." (Jinan "North China News," issues 3222 and 3223.)

"On every street in Shanghai, you can see groups of Allied friends in khaki and black uniforms, and jeeps of the Allies one after another. These cars drive recklessly, and there are often news reports of people being hit or run over." (Ibid.)

"Every evening after dusk, the entertainment venues and bars in Shanghai are illuminated like paradise. The Allies enter, laughing and joking, and come out drunk, bumping into everything. If they encounter a man, they punch him. If it is a woman, they first grope and fondle, then forcibly kiss her..." (Ibid.)

I should cherish my paper and pen and not quote any more. I think these are all "more touching scenes." Dear readers who have national self-esteem and are unwilling to be slaves, I believe you share the same feeling!

According to a survey, from October of last year when American troops arrived in Shanghai to January 10th of this year, American troops committed 94 cases in Shanghai, excluding jeep injuries. Among them, there were 36 cases of injury, 11 cases of robbery, 12 cases of damage, and 5 cases each of theft, robbery, negligence, and injury. There were 3 cases each of fraud and offenses against public morals, 2 cases each of negligence and injury resulting in death, and 1 case each of disturbing the peace and obstructing official duties. (Shanghai Chongxian Daily Special Dispatch)

After China's victory in the Anti-Japanese War, the ferocity of the descendants of Yamato seems to have subsided slightly; but on the other hand, the G.I. warriors who crossed the ocean have become "unparalleled" and "favorites of heaven" with the surrender of Japan. In Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, and several large cities, they drive jeeps, hug "jeep girls," and rush around as if charging towards the "Yamashita defense line." It is heard every day that citizens are injured or run over. Among those whose names are known are the famous writers Xia Yan and Ge Baoquan. How many more are there whose names are unknown! The ferocity in the car, the flesh and blood under the car, brawls, injuries, robberies, damage, "socializing," "liveliness"... emerge endlessly in these years after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, in this territory of China, one of the "Big Four" powers, which is truly a feeling of both laughter and tears! (⑴⑵)

Perhaps in order to "ease public opinion" or "buy popular support," recently "Tianjin American military authorities stipulated that if a Chinese person is killed due to an accident caused by American soldiers, a compensation of 100,000 yuan will be paid uniformly; if a donkey is killed, a compensation of 135,000 yuan will be paid." (April 16th, Chongqing Commercial Daily). What a demeanor of a rich young master! But, "a life for a life, paying debts," this is a legal principle followed by Chinese society, and I think it is generally the same both at home and abroad. Furthermore, why can "a Chinese person being killed due to an accident caused by American soldiers," regardless of what kind of "accident" it is, and how the "accident" was "caused," be settled with a "uniform" compensation of 100,000 yuan? Isn't it too cheap?! If that is the case, then Chinese people may as well "cause an accident" once and "kill" Marshall or Gillem, anyway, a "uniform compensation of 100,000 yuan" can settle everything. Although the skin color is different, they are all human beings of flesh and blood.

A donkey "killed" is compensated 135,000 yuan, while a "Chinese person" "killed" receives a 75% discount. The Tianjin American military authorities must also be human, so let me ask you: In the New World, "how can one not know a donkey"!?

The 100,000 "yuan" is not specified as "gold" or "U.S." currency, so it is probably priced in legal tender. According to the Tianjin Central Bank's foreign exchange quotation on May 12th, one U.S. dollar is legally equivalent to 2,610 yuan in legal tender (the black market exchange rate is of course higher). 100,000 yuan in legal tender is equivalent to 38 U.S. dollars and 31 cents. No wonder an Associated Press reporter said with a sigh: "American soldiers in North China have discovered that in this productive country, human life is very cheap." (Ibid.) Yes, China is a "productive country" with a population of 450 million. In the eight years of the national liberation war, I don't know how many lives were sacrificed, but their lives were not, and certainly not, for the exchange of 38 U.S. dollars and 31 cents, but to win national freedom and liberation! For the liberation and freedom of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people, their lives can be worthless, but other than that, their lives should be priceless!

During our joint fight against Japan, the American military was indeed our valuable ally, but today, looking at all their words and deeds in China, the word "friend" cannot but make people suspicious.

Jeep accidents, "socializing," "liveliness," etc., these are relatively minor matters. What is more important is that "the situation of close cooperation between the US and Chiang in slaughtering the Chinese people deserves serious attention!" Marshall seems to be working hard to call for peace in Northeast China and China, while the Kuomintang army, equipped with American weapons, is continuously transported to Northeast China by American ships, helping Chiang Kai-shek expand the civil war. A righteous American journalist reported: "The so-called American assistance in disarming and repatriating Japanese troops is actually transporting Kuomintang troops with warships and airplanes, while Japanese troops are used to protect transportation. Six-sevenths of the Japanese troops in North China still fully retain their weapons." Another fair American journalist also reported: "The Kuomintang, under the cover of the American military, is advancing along the Beining Railway and conducting a large-scale civil war in Manchuria. The U.S. Marine Corps is stationed in various places along the northern line and in northern Hebei for this purpose." As Mr. Luo Longji, a leader of the Democratic League, said: "If the United States stops supporting the government army, the National Government will not be able to continue the civil war. If this support stops, the government will have to negotiate. Does the United States want to implement fascism in China? Are you going to let Franco move to China?"

May I ask: Does such behavior violate the principle of "freedom from fear" of the late President Roosevelt? Is there any difference between such behavior and Hurley's China policy?! It should be known that Hurley's name will forever leave a despicable and ugly impression in the memories of the Chinese and American people!

In the communiqué of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference last year, it was stipulated that Soviet and American troops should withdraw from China in the shortest possible period. Now the Soviet troops have completely withdrawn from the Northeast as agreed, while the American troops remaining in China remain unchanged, no, they are constantly increasing. Major General Gillem, commander-in-chief of the US forces in China, recently announced to reporters: "The US military headquarters in China will not be abolished at the end of June this year... In the second half of the year, the US military headquarters will have about 4,000 personnel... The US Army Department has now begun preparing to transport the families of American personnel working in China to China. The first batch may arrive in September this year. The US military authorities are carefully planning the housing and children's education issues after the arrival of the American military families." It seems that the American troops remaining in China not only will not withdraw from China immediately, but also seem to have plans for "long-term stability," as if they plan to help Chiang Kai-shek finish the civil war, and then "live and work in peace" in "China" and be stationed there for generations to come.

What a "far-sighted" plan! But we want to tell those G.I. generals: The China of the 1940s, which has experienced the flames of the eight-year national liberation war, is no longer a "paradise for adventurers"!

American allies who once fought with us against fascist aggression, you are the descendants of Washington and Lincoln, and your New York has a Statue of Liberty. There is a game popular among American children called "teasing the police," in which one child pretends to be a policeman, and the others try their best to make fun of him, make him suffer losses, and do all kinds of mischief. It is said that this game signifies their aversion to privilege and interference. Then, "do not do unto others what you do not want done unto you." If the 450 million Chinese people get angry and "tease the police" with you, it will not be a game.

    寄语花旗将军
    漠野
    “在礼堂正面右角的玻璃窗下，有着一个更动人的镜头，主席夫人与马帅夫人，围绕着一个圆桌坐下，马帅以极轻松的姿态，两手扶着两位夫人的沙发背在谈，这一角的笑声，连续不断，形成了重大团欢乐中的最高音阶。”（五月十日北平国民新报《五五茶会记盛》）
    这位记者先生可谓速写能手，寥寥数行，不仅衬托出了“还都典礼”的“盛况”，而且把“中美两大盟邦”的一亲睦之谊”，也描画的“恰到好处”。没有异议，这的确是一个“更动人的镜头”，然而，“更动人的镜头”，却还不只这一个。
    “天津美军喝酒闹事的事增多了…………现在他们除在舞厅酒店闹事外、又改变了一种方式，他们将滋事的场面移到大街小巷了，每夜十点钟后随时随地都可听到他们酒后的吼声，坐三轮车、黄包车的人时常被殴打，三轮车黄包车夫常被打得吐血，而且有时拉了半天得不到钱，所以在天津目前很少有车子专候美军了。最近几天挨喝酒的美兵打的人最多，前些天有位交通警察被他们打死了………今天的秩序更乱了，他们打坏了一家米庄，弄乱了一家大商店，打伤了很多人。………”（二月八日上海正言报）
    “……于是大人先生们的太太小姐们，为了优待盟军，也不妨破例来一次社交公开，借以敦睦“邦交”，美军在这些场合下，也就显得分外‘活泼’。”（济南《华北新闻报》三二二三期。）
    “上海每一条街道上，都可以看见黄呢黑呢衣成群的盟友，和盟友一辆接一辆的吉普车。这些车行驶起来横冲直撞，常常有被撞或辗死人的新闻。”（同上）
    “每到黄昏以后，上海市各娱乐场、酒场，电光照耀的如同天堂，盟友嘻嘻哈哈地进去，醉醺醺地出来，东碰西撞，遇见男人餐以拳头，如系女子先以抹揣，继以强上弓式的接吻………。”（同上）
    我应当珍惜我的纸笔，不再多抄引了，这些我看都是“更动人的镜头”，具有民族自尊心而不愿做奴隶的亲爱读者呵，想必你们亦复具有同感吧！
    据调查自去年十月美军抵沪至本年一月十日期间，美军在沪除吉普伤人外，共犯案九十四件，其中伤害案为三十六件，抢夺案十一件，毁损案十二件，其他盗窃，强盗、过失、伤害各五件，诈欺妨害风化各三件，过失及伤害致死各二件，妨害安宁及妨害公务各一件（上海重线日报特讯）
    中国抗战胜利以后，大和子孙的凶焰，似乎已略形消敛；但另一方面，远渡重洋的花旗武士们，却随着日本之投降而“不可一世”而成为“天之骄子”了。在上海、平、津、几个大的都市里，他们驾着吉普车，抱着“吉普女郎”，横冲直撞，仿佛向“山下奉文防线”冲锋似的，市民们被撞伤或辗死者，日有所闻、知道名字的有著名作家夏衍与戈宝权，不知道名字的，还不知道有多少！车上的狞狰，车下的血肉、凶殴、伤害、抢夺、毁损、“社交”、“活泼”………层出不穷的出现在这抗战胜利后的年月里，在这“四大强国”之一的中国领土上，真令人不禁有啼笑皆非之感！（⑴⑵）
    也许是为了“缓和舆论”，或者是“收买民心”吧，最近“天津美军当局规定，华人因美军击祸致死的，一律赔偿十万元，驴子致死的，赔偿十三万五千元。”（四月十六日重庆商务日报载）。真是有钱公子哥儿的气派！但，“杀人抵命，欠债还钱”，这是中国社会所奉行的一条法律准则，古今中外，我想大抵也是如此。再则，为什么“华人因美军肇祸致死的”，就可以勿论是什么“祸”，而“祸”又是怎样“肇”的，“一律”赠偿十万元而了事呢？未免太便宜了吧？！如果是那样，那末，中国人也不妨“肇祸”一次，“致死”马歇尔，齐兰，反正“一律赔偿十万元”，就可了事大吉。肤色虽有所不同，但其为血肉之躯的人则一也。
    一头毛驴“致死”赔偿十三万五千元，而一个“华人”“致死”，却要来一个七五折。天津美军当局想必也是人，我且问问你们：在新大陆上，“岂可人而不知驴乎”！？
    十万“元”既未加以“金”“美”字样，想系以法币作价。据天津中央银行五月十二日外汇挂牌，美金一元币合法币二千六百一十元（黑市比价当然更高），十万法币折合美金三十八元三角一分。无怪乎美联社记者慨乎言之地说道：“华北美军发觉，在这个多产的国家里，人命是非常便宜的。”（同上）是的，中国是“多产的国家”，人口有四万万五千万，在八年的民族解放战争中，也不知道牺牲了多少生命，但他们的生命并没有而且也决不是为了换取三十八元三角一分钱，而是为了夺取民族的自由与解放！为了中华民族与中国人民的解放与自由，他们的生命可以一钱不值，但除此以外，他们的生命应当是无价的！
    在我们并肩对日作战的过程中，美军确曾是我们可珍贵的盟友，但今天，观乎他们在中国的一切举止言行，这个“友”字就不能不令人有所疑虑了。
    吉普肇祸、“社交”“活泼”等等，那些还是比较小而言之的事体，更重大的，是“美蒋双方密切合作屠杀中国人民的形势，深堪注意！”马歇尔一面好像在努力呼吁东北与中国和平，同时，用美国武器装备的国民党军却源源不断地由美舰运往东北，帮凶蒋介石扩大内战。一位有正义感的美国记者报导：“美国所谓帮助解除武装，遣送日军回国，实际上是用军舰与飞机转运国民党军队，而日军则用于保护交通，在华北日军尚有七分之六完全保有自己的武装。”另一位公正的美国记者也这样报导：“国民党在美军掩护之下，沿北宁路前进，在满洲进行大规模内战。美国海军陆战队为此目的，在北方沿线与河北北部驻守各地。”诚如民盟领袖罗隆基氏所云：“倘若美国停止支持政府军队，国民政府是不可能继续内战的。如果这种支持停止，政府就不得不谈判。难道美国要中国实行法西斯主义吗？难道你们让佛朗哥移到中国来吗？
    试问：这样的干法，是否违背了故罗斯福总统之“免于恐怖的自由”的原则呢？这样的干法，与赫尔利对华政策又有什么两样呢？！应当知道，赫尔利的名字，在中美两国人民的记忆里，永远留下了一个卑污丑恶的印象！
    在去年莫斯科三外长会议的公报中，曾规定苏军与美军在最短期间撤离中国，现苏军已如约自东北完全撤退了，而留华美军却仍然原封未动，不，不断地在增加着。驻华美军总司令齐兰（即吉伦）少将，最近对记者宣告：“美军驻华司令部，在本年六月底并不撤消，……下半年美军司令部人员将有四千人左右……美陆军部现已开始筹备将留华工作美军家属运华，首批可在本年九月到达。美军家属抵华后之居住问题，及儿童教育问题，均由美军当局诺细规划中。”如此看来，留华美军不但不立即撤离中国，而且似有“长治久安”之计，仿佛打算帮蒋介石把内战打完以后，就在“支那”“安居乐业”，子孙万代千秋的驻下去。
    好一个“深谋远虑”的打算！但我们要正告那些花旗将军们：广大人民已经历了八年民族解放战争之烈火锻炼的、二十世纪五十年代的中国，已经不是“冒险家的乐园了”！
    曾与我们共同为反法西斯侵略而战的美国盟友呵，你们是华盛顿、林肯的子孙，你们的纽约有一座自由女神。在美国孩子中流行着一种游戏的“作弄警察”，由一个孩子装作警察，其他的人就千方百计的取笑他，给他亏吃，尽恶作剧的能事。据说这种游戏意味着他们对于特权和干涉的厌恶。那么，“已经不欲，勿施于人。”如果四万万五千万中国人民，愤怒起来对你们“作弄警察”，那可就不是游戏了。
