Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 11th: Batavia dispatch: Indonesian (formerly known as the Dutch East Indies, now abbreviated as Indonesia) President Sukarno announced an emergency law on the 8th to cope with the new offensive by the Dutch army. A National Defense Committee has now been formed, consisting of Prime Minister Sjahrir, the ministers of the Interior, Defense, Finance, Social Welfare, and Transportation, the Commander-in-Chief of the Indonesian Army, and three representatives of people's organizations. Its task is to implement various emergency measures. It is reported that in the recent offensive, the Dutch army occupied Tangerang, west of Batavia, but was subsequently blocked by the Indonesian patriotic army. It is said that the new Dutch offensive has brought the work of transporting Indonesian rice to India to a halt. Furthermore, it is reported that some British troops on the front lines in Java have been relieved by Dutch troops, and the transfer of British military power in Surabaya has been completed, but small-scale battles between British and Indonesian troops still occur from time to time.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 11th: According to Reuters: A dispute has arisen between Britain and Holland over Indonesia's aid to India with 500,000 tons of rice. The Dutch government has lodged a protest with the British government, arguing that Britain's assistance in transporting Indonesian rice to India is tantamount to recognizing the Indonesian government, and that Holland itself is in dire need of rice. The British response is that Britain's actions do not amount to recognition of the Sjahrir government, and in any case, the need for famine relief outweighs legalistic details, and therefore rice will still be transported to India by British and Indian ships. Furthermore, according to the same agency: British merchants are increasingly impatient with the continuing Indonesian war. Their investments in Java are estimated at £550 million. Currently, their operations in Batavia have come to a standstill. All previous trade has almost been severed, pre-war bank balances have been frozen, and offices and warehouses have been requisitioned.

    【新华社延安十一日电】巴达维亚讯：印尼（东印改现名，为印度尼西亚之简称）总统苏加诺八日宣布紧急法，以应付荷军的新进攻，现已组成国防委员会，委员有总理沙利尔，内政部、国防部、财政部、社会福利部、交通部各部部长，印尼军总司令及人民团体的代表三人。其任务为执行各种紧急措施。据讯：荷军于最近的进攻中，曾占领巴达维亚以西的坦其隆，但旋被印尼爱国军堵住。据说荷军的新进攻，已使印尼大米运印工作停顿。又讯：爪哇若干前线英军，已由荷军接防，泗水英人军权已交代完毕，但英军与印尼军的小规模战事，仍时有发生。
    【新华社延安十一日电】据路透社讯：英荷就印度尼西亚以五十万吨大米援助印度事，发生争执。荷政府顷向英政府提出抗议，认为英国帮助运输印尼大米赴印，无异承认印度尼西亚政府，且荷兰本身正需米甚急。英国的回答是：英国的行动，并不等于承认沙利尔政府，而且不管怎样，饥荒的需要超过了法律上的细节，因而大米仍将由英印船只运往印度。又据该社讯：英国商人对印度尼西亚战争的绵延不绝，日益表示不耐烦。他们在爪哇的投资，估计达五亿五千万英磅。现他们在巴达维亚已处于停顿状态。以前的一切贸易，几乎均为断绝，战前的银行余款被冻结，办事处和仓库也被征用。
