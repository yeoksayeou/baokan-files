Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th. Kuang Rennong, the Communist Party representative of the Jinan Group, and others were illegally detained by the Kuomintang authorities on the 9th, and their radio station was confiscated. The safety of these representatives is not guaranteed. On the same day, the Jinan Telegraph Bureau also restricted the freedom of movement of Liu Liqing, the Communist Party representative of the joint Kuomintang-Communist Party Materials Committee, and ordered him to leave Jinan. Liu and others were escorted away by Fang, the secretary of the Communist Party representative of the Jinan Group, but Fang's wife was unreasonably forced back by the Kuomintang authorities at Jinan Railway Station, and the current situation and whereabouts of the group are unknown. Ye Jianying, a Communist Party representative on the Military Mediation Board, has lodged a serious protest with the Kuomintang regarding this serious incident of disrupting the mediation agreement.
Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 15th. The 24th Transportation Group, on its way back from a survey south of Hanzhuang on the 10th, passed through the area north of Liguo Station when so-called "refugees," instigated and organized by Kuomintang secret agents, suddenly blocked the road under the pretext of "petitioning," and violently assaulted Ni Shimin, the Communist Party representative of the group. Comrade Ni Shimin was injured in the attack, and his belongings and the No. 450 badge of the Communist Party delegation were snatched away. After this incident occurred, our side immediately lodged a serious protest, but the Kuomintang side did not respond.

    【新华社延安十五日电】济南小组中共代表邝任农等，于九日被国民党当局非法扣留，并将电台等没收。现该代表等，安全毫无保障。同日济南电局，又将国共双方合组之物资委员会中共代表刘李清限制行动自由，并勒令离开济南。刘等由济南小组中共代表秘书房等护送离济，但房夫在济南车站又被国民党当局无理迫回，小组现况与下落不明。军调部中共代表叶剑英委员，已对此种严重破坏调处协定事件，向国方提出严重抗议。
    【新华社临沂十五日电】第二十四交通小组，十日由徐州赴韩庄以南调查，于返回时，路经利国驿车站以北地区，突有国民党特务指使和组织之所谓“难民”，借口拦路“请愿”，奔向该小组中共代表中凶猛殴打，中共代表倪士民同志当被殴伤，其衣物及第四五零号中共代表团证章，均被抢去。此事发生后，我方立即提出严重抗议，但国民党方面竟不回答。
