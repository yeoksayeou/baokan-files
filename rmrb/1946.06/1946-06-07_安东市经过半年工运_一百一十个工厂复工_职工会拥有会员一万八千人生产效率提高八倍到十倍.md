Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 4th. The Andong City Second Workers' Congress, lasting half a month, successfully concluded on the 23rd of last month. At the congress, the representatives made typical reports on reasoning, settling accounts, and increasing production and investment, summarized the experience of the emancipation movement, and the Secretary-General of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Lin Zhiming, summarized the labor movement of the past half month. In the past half year, the workers of Andong have successively launched a vigorous movement to settle accounts and emancipate themselves, reasoning with the big traitors and secret agents who ruled and exploited the workers for fourteen years. A total of 11,512 people participated, conducting 51 reasoning sessions. Ninety-six trade unions were organized throughout the city, with 18,000 members. With the help and promotion of the Federation of Trade Unions and the democratic local government, 110 factories have fully resumed work. The highest wage is 15 jin of grain per day, the general wage is 10 jin, and the lowest is 5 jin. The lives of workers have generally improved, and their enthusiasm for production has greatly increased. In the production competition, 40 production models were created, and production efficiency increased eight to ten times. In the past half year, more than 300 workers have been elected as district and street chiefs, 29 workers have been elected as provincial and municipal councilors and provincial administrative committee members, one person has been elected as a national delegate, and more than 300 people have been elected as factory directors, section chiefs, department heads, and members of factory management committees. Culturally, the workers have also begun to turn over, with reading rooms in factories, and more than 200 workers becoming newspaper correspondents, with workers' manuscripts frequently appearing in the newspapers. Most factories have established night schools and clubs, and there are currently more than 50 cooperatives and stores opened by the workers themselves in the city. To protect their own interests, more than 6,000 workers have armed themselves. Finally, Lin Zhiming pointed out that the future task is to give full play to initiative, improve production quality, create and reward production models, and appropriately improve workers' lives under the policy of labor-capital cooperation and consideration of both public and private interests. At the same time, it is necessary to promote small-scale industrial production, help factories resume work, and help improve the management of various factories to make them scientific.
