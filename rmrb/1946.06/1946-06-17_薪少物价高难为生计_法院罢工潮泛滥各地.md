Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 14th: While the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan are still in dispute over the adjustment of salaries for public employees, the court employee strikes that began in Shanghai and Nanjing have spread to Peiping, Chongqing, Guangdong and other places. The reason for the strikes is the demand for higher salaries. Current salaries are absolutely unable to maintain a living, and prices have risen to 5,000, 10,000, or even 30,000 times pre-war levels. Even according to the official, deliberately reduced cost-of-living index, it has increased by 4,000 times compared to pre-war levels. However, the increase in salaries is only about 100 times the pre-war level. Starting in late May, the Shanghai High Court and District Court, the Nanjing District Court, and the Suzhou High Court successively held resignations, strikes, petitions, and work slowdowns. On June 1st, judges of the Nanjing Supreme Court also began a strike, demanding a salary increase to 1,000 times the pre-war level and a living allowance of 200,000 yuan per person. This demand was quickly echoed by court employees in major cities, becoming a common program for court strikes in various places. Starting on June 1st, more than 500 employees of the Chongqing District Court went on strike, making the same demands. Gao Jihou, the presiding judge of the Civil Division of the court, and others, met with the press to explain their difficult living conditions, stating that they would not return to work unless they received a satisfactory reply from the Executive Yuan. On June 2nd, all presiding judges, judges, and prosecutors of the Guangzhou High Court and District Court decided in a meeting to respond to the Supreme Court's demands for treatment and hold a three-day strike. All employees of the Peiping District Court announced a work stoppage. Court strikes in various places have lasted for two weeks (such as in Chongqing) or even more than three weeks (such as in Shanghai), but have not yet been reasonably resolved, and the strikes continue to persist.

    薪少物价高难为生计
    法院罢工潮泛滥各地
    【新华社延安十四日电】立法院、行政院关于调整公教人员待遇办法争执未决之际，从上海南京开始的法院职员罢工，已扩大到平、渝、粤等地。罢工原因，是要求增薪。因目前薪资已绝对无法维持生活，物价已涨至战前五千、一万甚至三万倍。即照官方有意缩小的生活指数，亦已比战前增四千倍。但薪资的增加，只为战前的一百多倍。上月下旬起，上海高等法院及地方法院，南京地方法院，苏州高等法院，即相继举行辞职、罢工、请愿及怠工。至六月一日，南京最高法院法官，亦开始罢工，并提出增薪至战前一千倍，及每人发给生活津贴二十万元。此要求迅速获得各大城市法院职员响应，成为各地法院罢工的共同纲领。本月一日起，重庆地方法院全体职员五百余人罢工，提出同样要求。该院民事庭长高季侯等，招待新闻界申述生活窘迫情形，表明除非获得行政院的圆满答复，决不复工。六月二日广州高等及地方法院全体庭长、推事及检察官，会议决定响应最高法院待遇要求，举行罢工三日。北平地方法院全体职员宣告停止工作。各地法院罢工，已达两周（如重庆）甚至三周以上（如上海），迄未获得合理解决，罢工仍继续坚持中。
