Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, Harbin, 5th. General Lin Biao, Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic Allied Forces, recently sent a telegram to General Pan Shuo-duan, Commander of the 184th Division who revolted in Haicheng, and General Zheng Zu-zhi, Deputy Commander, expressing his condolences and congratulations. The full text is as follows:

To Commander Pan, Deputy Commander Zheng, and all officers and soldiers of the 184th Division: We are delighted to hear that under the leadership of Commanders Pan and Zheng, your division's officers and soldiers have revolted against the civil war and are striving for peace. This heroic act is cheered by the people of the whole country and the people of the entire Northeast! All officers and soldiers of the Northeast Democratic Allied Forces were overjoyed to hear the news of your army's uprising, and are willing to work hand in hand with all officers and soldiers of your army to fight against the civil war and strive for peace together, and we will not stop until we achieve our goal! After reading the telegram of May 31, the words are earnest and the meaning is high. Every sentence is against the civil war, and every word is for peace. This is the voice of our national army. The national army and people fought hard for eight years to achieve national liberation. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, everyone hoped that the country would achieve peace, political democratization, and begin post-war recovery and construction. However, the fascist reactionaries in the Kuomintang, ignoring the people's desire for peace, launched a large-scale civil war, causing the Chinese people to kill each other. What is even more painful is that they rely on the United States' massive assistance in aircraft, tanks, artillery, warships, technical training, and other materials to frantically slaughter the Chinese people. The Northeast Democratic Allied Forces, in order to oppose the Kuomintang's civil war actions and strive for peace in the Northeast, had no choice but to take resolute self-defense actions against the Kuomintang army's offensive. In the future, thanks to your army's righteous actions, the forces striving for peace in the Northeast will be further strengthened, and all officers and soldiers in the Kuomintang who are unwilling to continue the civil war will follow the example of your division and raise the banner of righteousness against the civil war. The power of the people is infinite, and the power of peace is strong. We believe that our common cause of striving for peace and democracy will surely be victorious! I hereby express my condolences and congratulations!

　　Lin Biao and all officers and soldiers of the Democratic Allied Forces jointly declared. June 5th

    民主联军林彪总司令
    电贺一八四师举义
    为反对内战争取和平共同奋斗
    【新华社延安哈尔滨五日电】民主联军总司令林彪将军，顷致电在海城起义之一八四师师长潘朔端将军、副师长郑祖志将军表示慰问与祝贺。全文如下：
    潘师长、郑副师长并转一八四师全体将士勋鉴：欣闻在潘、郑师长的率领下，贵师将士起义反对内战，争取和平，此一壮举，为全国人民、全东北人民所欢呼！东北民主联军全体将士，在得到贵军起义消息后，无不欢喜若狂，并愿贵军全体将士，为反对内战，争取和平携手并进，共同奋斗，不达目的誓不休止！得读五月三十一日通电，词切意昂，句句为反对内战，语语为争取和平，这正是我全国军队的呼声。全国军民抗战八年，为争取民族解放，备尝艰苦；抗战胜利后，咸望全国实现和平，政治民主化，开始战后恢复及建设工作，而国民党内法西斯反动分子等，不顾全国军民渴望和平之要求，竟发动大规模内战，使中国人民自相残杀。而尤为痛心者，竟仗恃美国之飞机、坦克、大炮、军舰、技术训练及其他物资的巨大帮助，疯狂屠杀中国人民。东北民主联军为反对国民党的内战行动，为争取东北的和平，迫不得已，对国民党军的进攻采取坚决的自卫行动。今后由于贵军义举，在东北为争取和平的力量将更为增强，而国民党内一切不愿继续内战的官兵，均将效法贵师之范例，揭起反对内战之义旗。人民的力量是无限的，和平的力量是强大的，相信我们争取和平民主的共同事业一定会胜利！特此陈词，谨致慰问与祝贺之意！
