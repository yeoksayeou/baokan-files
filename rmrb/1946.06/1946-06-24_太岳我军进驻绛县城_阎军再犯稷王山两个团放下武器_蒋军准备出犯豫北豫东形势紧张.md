　　[This dispatch from our newspaper in Yangcheng, 22nd] Our Taiyue Eighth Route Army, amidst the warm welcome of the people, entered the city of Jiangxian on the 20th. On June 7th, Chen Ziwen, a traitorous puppet army officer in Jiangxian County, shamelessly attacked us in coordination with the large-scale civil war waged by Chiang and Yan's armies in Shanxi. Our army immediately counterattacked and quickly occupied the South Gate of Jiangxian. On the 20th, Chen launched an all-out attack on our positions west of the city. In response to the people's request, our army resolutely disarmed the puppet army in the city. A portion of the puppet army has fled to the mountainous area of Sanxianding, about 20 li south of Quwo, and is still engaged in fierce fighting with our forces.
    [This dispatch from our newspaper in Yangcheng, 21st] The Chiang-Yan armies have once again invaded Jiwang Mountain in southern Shanxi, and have continued to suffer resolute counterattacks from our army. The entire regiment of the 39th Division of the Yan army was wiped out by our forces, and more than 1,000 people, including the deputy regimental commander, were forced to lay down their arms. The regimental commander, Jia Shaotang, and more than 150 others were killed. In this self-defense battle, we captured one mountain gun, three mortars, five heavy machine guns, over a hundred light machine guns, and over five hundred rifles. More than 300 Yan soldiers from Xinjiang reinforcements were also repelled. This invasion by the Chiang-Yan armies began on the 11th, during which they occupied Liu Yu, Chan Qu, and Shangzhuang (30 li southwest of Xinjiang). On the 18th, the 215th Regiment of the 32nd Division of the Yan army also attacked us from Licun, while the 35th Division coordinated its advance southward. Thanks to the courageous fighting of our army and people, Liu Yu and other places were recovered, and the entire first regiment of the said division laid down its arms.
    [This dispatch from our newspaper in Handan, 21st] The situation in northern Henan is becoming increasingly tense as the Kuomintang reactionaries actively prepare to invade us. The discovery by the Xinxiang Executive Headquarters of the Kuomintang's illegal transportation of ammunition is a significant proof of this. On the 11th, five train cars of American-made bullets and shells were transported from Zhengzhou to Xinxiang. On the 11th and 12th, large quantities of carts and horses were used to transport them to the arsenal at the Huoshen Temple on Xiaoxijie Street in the city. After the three-party representatives of the group went to inspect, they personally saw that four cars had been unloaded and one car was waiting to be transported. During the inspection, the American representative took out an American-made bullet from a box for inspection, proving that it was indeed the case. The head of the First Ordnance Depot of the Nationalist side at the time refused the group to go to the arsenal for inspection. The American representative has telegraphed the Executive Headquarters about this transportation of military supplies and requested that it be stopped. At the same time, after Wu Shaozhou, the commander of the 85th Army of the Kuomintang army, returned to Xinxiang from Nanjing on the 10th, Xinxiang Railway Station immediately repaired its bunkers, and the atmosphere of war became even stronger. After a protest from our representative, the American representative, White Reger, also believed that this was an act of sabotaging the truce agreement.
    [This dispatch from our newspaper in Handan, 20th] The Chiang-puppet troops, who have been heroically attacked by our soldiers and civilians in eastern Henan, are now deploying a second "encirclement and suppression" campaign in the area. After the failure of the first phase of the Chiang-puppet troops' "encirclement and suppression" plan in the eastern Henan Liberated Area at the beginning of this month, the Kuomintang reactionaries immediately convened a military conference in Qi County to deploy the second "encirclement and suppression" campaign. The Chiang-puppet troops in each county have largely concentrated in Qi County. The Kuomintang 81st Division, originally assembled in Taikang, Suixian and other places, has also been deployed to Qi County, and its defense has been taken over by the puppet army of Zhang Lanfeng. Liu Ruzhen, the commander of the puppet 68th Army who occupied Kaocheng, also rushed to Qi County on the night of the 10th to participate in the "encirclement and suppression" meeting. In recent days, the Chiang-puppet troops in the area have been frequently mobilized, and the situation in eastern Henan is extremely tense.

　　太岳我军进驻绛县城
    阎军再犯稷王山两个团放下武器
    蒋军准备出犯豫北豫东形势紧张
    【本报阳城二十二日电】我太岳八路军在人民夹道欢迎中，于二十日进驻＠县城。六月七日，＠县伪军陈逆子文部策应蒋阎军在山西的大规模内战，无耻向我进攻，我军当予以反击，经激战后，当即占领＠县南关。二十日陈逆又向我城西阵地倾巢进犯，我军顺应人民之请，坚决解除该城伪军武装。现该伪一部窜至曲沃以南二十里的三县顶一带山地，仍与我激战中。
    【本报阳城二十一日电】蒋阎军再度向我汾南稷王山进犯，续遭我军坚决反击，阎军三十九师一团全部被我解决，副团长以下一千余人被迫放下武器，该团团长贾绍棠以下百五十余人被击毙。在此次自卫战中，我缴获山炮一门，迫击炮三门，重机枪五挺，轻机枪百余挺，步枪五百余枝。阎军三十九师三百余由新＠增援，亦被击退。蒋阎军此次进犯，开始于十一日，曾将我刘峪、禅曲、上庄（新＠西南三十里）占去，十八日阎军三十二师二一五团又自李村向我进犯，三十五师则配合南进，在我军民奋战下，当将刘峪等地恢复，该师一团全部放下武器。
    【本报邯郸二十一日电】豫北形势日益紧张，国民党反动派积极准备向我进犯，新乡执行小组查获国民党违法运输弹药，即可为显著之证明。十一日有美造子弹及炮弹五车皮由郑运新乡，十一、十二两日以大批车马向城内小西街火神庙军械库搬运，经小组三方代表前往检查，亲见四车已卸完，一车正待运。美代表于检查时，曾由箱内取出一枚美造子弹检视，证明确系事实。国方第一兵站分监当时曾拒绝小组前往军械库检查。美方代表已将此种运输军火行为电请执行部请予制止。同时国民党军八五军吴绍周十日自南京返新后，新乡车站即大修碉堡，战争空气更形浓厚，经我方代表抗议，美方代表白瑞格亦认为此系破坏停战协定之行为。
    【本报邯郸二十日电】遭我豫东军民英勇打击之蒋伪军现正对该区布置第二次“清剿”。自本月初旬，蒋伪军“清剿”豫东解放区的第一步计划失败后，国民党反动派紧接着便在杞县召开军事会议，布置第二次“清剿”，各县蒋伪军，均已大部向杞县集中，原集结于太康、睢县等地的国民党八十一师，亦已开赴杞县，其防务由伪军张岚峰接替。盘据考城之伪六十八军军长刘汝珍，亦于十日晚星夜赶赴杞县，参加“清剿”会议。数日来，该区蒋伪军，调动频繁，豫东形势万分紧张。
