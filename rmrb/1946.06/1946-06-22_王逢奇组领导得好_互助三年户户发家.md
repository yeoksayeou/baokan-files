[Report from our Changzhi office] In order to further promote the large-scale production campaign this year, on June 4th, all district-level cadres of the first district of Licheng gathered in Xia Village to examine and summarize the work of the labor hero Wang Fengqi's mutual aid group, and to study how to consolidate and develop Wang Fengqi's mutual aid group. After everyone's discussion, it was believed that the main reason for their success was that they had all prospered through organization, with both the poor and the rich benefiting, especially through mutual assistance in overcoming many difficulties. The group helped Wang Fukui build three houses the year before last (through equivalent exchange of labor), and last year they built three houses each for Wang Changcheng and Wang Zhaorui, built three toilets for Wang Changcheng, and this year they built four houses for Wang Fengqi, totaling thirteen houses built. In terms of land increase, Wang Jincheng in the group bought four mu of land, Dongsheng bought two and a half mu, Wang Jinqi bought three and a half mu, Yu Liu bought two mu, and Jiang Quan bought three and a half mu, totaling fifteen and a half mu of land purchased. They also repaired Wang Bukuan's five-foot-wide weir that had not been repaired for more than twenty years. The group increased their livestock by a total of three head. They have achieved great success in deep plowing and meticulous cultivation. Before 1944, the average grain yield per mu was 1.6 shi, and after organizing in 1944, the average grain yield per mu was 2 shi. Counting an increase of 0.4 shi per mu, the group increased production by a total of 133.6 shi in two years (the group has a total of 161.7 mu of land). Wang Zhaorui, a rich peasant, only harvested 1.5 shi per mu before mutual aid, but after mutual aid, the yield increased by 0.5 shi per mu. Eight households in the group rose from poor peasants to middle peasants. Furthermore, the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations is well-integrated, and the mutual aid group does not leave a single laborer idle during the slack season. Another important reason for the consistent consolidation of the mutual aid group is Wang Fengqi's democratic and arduous work style. He is good at patiently persuading group members with differing opinions, one or two times at a time. He never uses coercive methods, and never treats comrades in the group with a bad attitude. He is good at inspiring self-criticism by promoting advantages. He said, "One hand cannot cover the sky," and "The more heroes there are, the better the work will be." Under his influence, fourteen activists, two labor heroes, and one cooperative hero have emerged in the village. However, the group currently has three problems: first, some members have the idea of not wanting to get any richer; second, the group has a tendency towards isolationism; and third, accounts have not been settled since spring, all of which must be overcome quickly.

　　王逢奇组领导得好
    互助三年户户发家
    【本报长治讯】为了推动今年大生产运动前进一步，六月四日黎城一区全体区级干部集中霞村，检查与总结该区劳动英雄王逢奇互助组的工作，研究王逢奇互助组怎样巩固与发展的。经过大家讨论，认为主要是由于他们组织起来都发了财，贫富都沾了光，特别是互相帮助克服了很多困难。组里前年帮助王福魁盖了三间房子（等价换工），去年又给王长成、王兆瑞各盖房三间，给王长成砌厕所三个，今年又给王逢奇盖房四间，共盖房十三间，从土地增加上看，该组王晋成买地四亩，东生买地二亩半，王金奇买地三亩半，余六买地二亩，江全买地三亩半，共买地十五亩半，并把王步宽二十多年未修之五尺宽的堰修起来了。全组共增加畜力三头。在深耕细作方面，已获很大成绩，四四年前，每亩平均产粮一石六斗，四四年组织起来后，每亩平均产粮二石。以每亩增产四斗计，全组两年共增产一百卅三石六斗（全组共地一百六十一亩七分），富农王兆瑞的地，互助前每亩只打一石五斗，互助后每亩增产五斗，全组有八户，由贫农上升到中农。再就是农业副业结合得好，农闲时互助组也不闲一个劳动力。使互助组始终巩固的另一个重要原因，是王逢奇的民主而艰苦的作风，他善于一次二次的去耐心说服意见不同的组员，他从来不用强制的办法，也从来不对组内的同志起态度，他善于从发扬优点以启发大家的自我批评，他说：“一手盖不了天下”，“英雄越多工作越好”，在他的影响下，全村涌现了十四个积极分子，两个劳动英雄，一个合作英雄。但目前该组存在着三个问题，一是组员中存在不愿再发家的思想，一是该组存在关门主义的现象，三是从春至今还没有算账，均须很快克服。
