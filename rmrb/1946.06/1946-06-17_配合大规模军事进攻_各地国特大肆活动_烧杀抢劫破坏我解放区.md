Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: To coordinate with their large-scale military offensives, the Kuomintang reactionaries have recently dispatched large numbers of special agents, bandits, and ruffians into various liberated areas to carry out destructive activities such as arson, murder, looting, and poisoning. In Pingyao and Jiexiu in the Jin-Sui Liberated Area, in the first half of April alone, 60% of the villages in the county were attacked at night by small armed special agent units dispatched by Yan Xishan. A total of 109 cadres and civilians were kidnapped, 17 were killed, and more than 720 were injured. In the Yanbei area, Yan's forces also used several armed special agent units to carry out harassment. On the 25th of last month, more than 50 armed special agents dispatched from Daiyue sneaked into Huangtugou, killing the chief of the Youyu Security Section and other cadres, and looting more than 50 head of livestock from the residents. Fifteen armed special agents dispatched from Datong infiltrated the villages of Shahebao and Xiashunjian near Polubao in the liberated area, killing seven civilians. The bandits fled to the vicinity of Gaoshan, where they were routed by the Eighth Route Army, and ten were captured alive. According to a recently captured telegram from Yan's "Datong Three-Person Group," dated May 18th, Ji Zi No. 38, armed groups in each county were instructed to sabotage the liberated areas by using "communist disguises" and assassination-style night attacks. In Jinan, Xuzhou, and other places, the Kuomintang authorities have gathered ruffians and local bullies to organize armed "Homecoming Legions" to harass the liberated areas. The Jinan Municipal Party Headquarters recently dispatched more than 1,500 people to spread out along the Jinpu Railway line in the areas of Gongli and Culaishan. The armed special agents dispatched by the Xuzhou Kuomintang authorities, as far as is known, include several units led by Lu Jintang, Feng Zhuang, and Liu Zunzhou, with more than 400 people and guns, operating in the areas of Dawujia and Liuhebei. The puppet troops along the Jiaoji Railway have also dispatched 68 special agent units, with more than 940 people and guns, to harass the border areas of Yidu, Shouguang, Zouping, and Zhangqiu. In Hu Ji District of our Shanghe County, during a mass meeting of more than 500 people a few days ago, Kuomintang special agents actually put a large amount of poison into water jars and pots, poisoning more than 100 people. After being poisoned, people vomited yellow water and white foam, their bodies shook, and they were unable to speak. After treatment, all were rescued except for two who died due to severe poisoning. The Qingdao Kuomintang authorities have also dispatched poisoning teams to sneak into the liberated areas north of Binhai. Each team consists of three to five people, mostly carrying a piece of talc and a small silver coin as a code. Among them are female special agents, each carrying a red cloth chain.
