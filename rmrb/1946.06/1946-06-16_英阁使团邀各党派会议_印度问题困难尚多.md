Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 13th: According to Reuters, New Delhi: The British Cabinet Mission and Indian Viceroy Wavell plan to take swift action within days to resolve the issue of the Indian interim government. On the 10th, they invited Congress leaders Azad and Nehru to hold talks to discuss unresolved issues so that the Congress Party could announce its decision on the British Cabinet Mission's plan. Muslim League Chairman Jinnah wrote to Wavell stating that if the formation of the interim government deviates from the principle of equality, it will inevitably lead to opposition from the Muslim League. On the other hand, the Congress Party believes that it controls nine of the eleven provinces of British India and opposes the Muslim League being on an equal footing with the party. Sikh leader Singh claimed that the British Cabinet Mission had failed to protect the interests of the Sikh people, and although the Sikh community has been considered one of the major parties in India, the guarantees given to Muslims are even being denied to the Sikhs. It is reported that the Sikhs are one of the minority ethnic groups in India, with a population of millions.

    英阁使团邀各党派会议
    印度问题困难尚多
    【新华社延安十三日电】据路透社新德里讯：英阁使团与印督魏菲尔，图于日内采取迅速行动，解决印临时政府问题。十日他们邀国大党领袖阿沙德与尼赫鲁，举行会谈，商讨悬而未决的诸问题，以便国大党能宣布其对英阁使团计划的决定。回盟主席金纳致函魏菲尔称：若组临时政府时背离平等原则，势将引起回盟反对。另一方面，国大党认为该党控制了英属印度十一省中的九省，反对回盟与该党属于同等地位。锡克族领袖森格则声称：英阁使团未能保护锡克族之权益，虽然该族已被认为系印度主要党派之一，但回教徒所得的保障，甚至拒绝给与锡克族。按锡克族为印少数民族之一，人口数百万。
