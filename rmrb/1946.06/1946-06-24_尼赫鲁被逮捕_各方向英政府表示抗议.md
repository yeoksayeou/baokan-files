Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 21st: According to Reuters, New Delhi: Nehru, the president of the Indian National Congress, was arrested on the 20th by the local Indian prince of Kashmir province. The Kashmir local Indian government declared: "Because Nehru insisted on going to Srinagar city in Kashmir, his arrest was necessary to stop him."

　　尼赫鲁被逮捕
    各方向英政府表示抗议
    【新华社延安二十一日电】据路透社新德里讯：印国大党主席尼赫鲁，二十日为克什米尔省土印王公逮捕，据克什米尔土印政府宣称：“由于尼赫鲁坚持欲往克什米尔的斯立那加城，非逮捕他不足以阻其行”。按克什米尔在印西北，斯立那加为其省会。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】据路透社讯：尼赫鲁在克什米尔被捕数小时后，伦敦各印度协会常务委员会均召开紧急会议，并向英政府提出抗议。泛印联合会领袖之一阿布拇汉，形容土邦此举为“横暴行为”，谓“印封建土邦，应与英国控制权一齐废除”。在新德里开会的印国大党执委会，亦于二十日开始不定期之休会，非至尼赫鲁被释归来，将不再行开会讨论英方对印新计划。
