Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Moscow today broadcast: Chinese and foreign newspapers continue to criticize the Kuomintang's unwillingness to cease fire, and the U.S. transportation and equipping of Kuomintang troops to expand the civil war, and point out that the U.S. policy towards China is a continuation of the Hurley policy. After the Siping Street battle, Chinese newspapers unanimously demanded a stop to the civil war, and even some Kuomintang newspapers pointed out that in this battle, the Kuomintang used American-equipped and trained troops to fight, but made no progress in a month and lost more than 10,000 people. New York Post reporter Martin reported: If the Democratic Allied Forces do not automatically give up Changchun, then the Kuomintang does not know how much time and loss it will have to pay. The broadcast then excerpted foreign newspaper radio reports and commentaries on the Kuomintang reactionaries' insistence on expanding the civil war, and the U.S. policy toward China. The British Times May 27th dispatch: The CCP stated that it was prepared to make concessions on the Manchuria issue, proposing a ceasefire and the organization of a coalition government, but the reactionaries in the Nanjing government advocated continuing the war. New York radio broadcast: The CCP hopes to establish a coalition government with the Kuomintang in Manchuria, but Chiang Kai-shek declared that negotiations would not be conducted until the entire Manchuria was captured. Due to the opposition of Chiang Kai-shek's right-wing elements, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party were prevented from reaching an agreement. They advocated using force against the CCP and pressuring the more moderate elements of the Kuomintang. U.S. Columbia Broadcasting Corporation reporter Urad condemned the Kuomintang, saying: They hindered the correct understanding of the current situation in China by the outside world, and praised the CCP as the most democratic elements. They believe in their own strength and strive to stop the civil war. The reporter also pointed out that the Kuomintang's right-wing reactionaries oppose making peace with the CCP. Martin pointed out: Chiang Kai-shek personally ordered the Kuomintang army to continue the offensive. Foreign newspaper reporters reported that the ceasefire agreement had the same effect on the Northeast, but the U.S. military continued to transport troops and ammunition to supply the Kuomintang army in the Northeast and protect their transportation lines. The British World News Magazine condemned the fact that while ceasefire negotiations were underway, the U.S. military remained in China, and still remains in China to this day, and pointed out that there has been no change in U.S. policy toward China, and the Hurley policy is still continuing, only continuing in another form.

    中外各报坚持要求和平协商
    谴责蒋介石亲自指挥内战
    美国帮助国民党内战乃赫尔利政策的继续
    【新华社延安二日电】莫斯科今日广播：中外各报继续指责国民党不愿停战，及美运输与装备国民党军扩大内战，并指出美国对华政策是赫尔利政策的继续。四平街战役后中国各报一致要求停止内战，甚至若干国民党报纸也指出这次战役，国民党用美国装备与训练的军队作战，但在一个月内毫无进展，且损失了一万余人。纽约邮报记者马丁报导：如果民主联军不自动放弃长春，那国民党就不知要付出多少时间与损失。广播继即摘引外国报纸无线电关于国民党内反动派坚持扩大内战，以及美国对华政策的报导与评论。英泰晤士报五月二十七日电讯：中共表示对满洲问题准备让步，提出停战及组织联合政府，但是南京政府内反动派则主张继续作战。纽约无线电广播：中共希望在满洲与国民党共同建立联合政府，可是蒋介石却声明，在夺取整个满洲以前，不进行谈判。由于蒋介石的右派分子的反对，阻挠了国共两党达到协议，他们主张对中共采取武力，并压迫国民党比较温和的分子。美哥伦比亚广播公司记者乌拉德谴责国民党说：他们妨碍外界对中国现状正确的了解，并赞扬中共是最民主的分子，他们相信自己的力量，力图达到停止内战。该记者并指出：国民党的右派反动分子，反对与中共讲和。马丁指出：蒋介石在亲自下令要国民党军继续进攻。外国报纸记者报导停战协议对东北有同样效力，然而美国军继续运输军队与弹药，供给东北的国民党军队，并替他们保卫交通线。英国世界新闻杂志谴责在进行停战谈判时，美国军队却留在中国，而且直到现在仍留在中国，并指出美国对华政策并没有任何变化，赫尔利政策仍在继续着，只是在另一形式下继续而已。
