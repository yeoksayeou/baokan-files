    兴安省政府临参会成立
    【新华社哈尔滨十四日电】（迟到）代表二百余万蒙汉人民的兴安省民主政府及省临参会，已于全省人民代表大会上，宣告正式成立。大会于五月二十六日揭幕，当时共出席代表五百余人，会上曾讨论了今后兴安省民主和经济建设等各项重大问题；并选出特木多巴根为省主席，张策为副主席，博彦满都为议长。此次大会的举行，标志着兴安省开始走向地方自治与民族自治的道路。按兴安省为东北九省中面积最大者，直辖四个盟，二十九个旗，两个县，和两个市。全省二百余万人口中，八十余万蒙胞，都以务农和畜牧为主，一百二十余万汉人以务农和经商为主，蒙胞生性强悍，勤于劳动。该省于“八一五”解放后，曾在蒙汉人民亲密团结下，举行武装起义，消灭敌伪，仅在墙厂一带，即杀死日寇官兵千余名。兴安省汉家人民团结，共同建设民主的兴安省，根据政协决议中，以省为单位，实行地方自治与实行民族自治的决议，正式成立省政府与临参会，全省人民对此，莫不欢欣鼓舞与竭诚拥护。
