    TASS Reveals
    Kuomintang Army Preserves Japanese Troops
    Frequently Drives Them to Attack Our Liberated Areas
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th] TASS, Shanghai, 9th dispatch: According to reliable sources, within the Chinese government army, Japanese troops who have not yet been disarmed are still commanded by their original officers and are frequently used in the anti-communist civil war. It is reported that in Qin County, Shanxi, there are more than 4,000 Japanese troops who have not been disarmed, while in the Taiyuan area, there are more than 10,000. In Anhui Province, the Japanese troops were disarmed shortly after the Japanese surrendered, but were later re-armed and incorporated into the Chinese government army. Before the Japanese surrender, a large portion of the Japanese troops originally stationed in Shandong Province and the Tianjin area were incorporated into the Kuomintang army. The same situation exists in Hubei. In Yan Xishan's Second War Area troops, there are a large number of Japanese troops. In some regiments, two battalions are Chinese troops and one battalion is Japanese troops, and the Chinese military camps have Japanese instructors. Every unit of Yan Xishan's First Cavalry Army has a number of Japanese personnel inserted, and a large number of Japanese officers serve as commanders in the ranks above the company level. It is reported that a Sino-Japanese training group has now been established. In Fu Zuoyi's troops, there are Japanese infantry units, all wearing Chinese military uniforms. The technical personnel (cavalry, engineers, and tank drivers, etc.) in Hu Zongnan's troops are all Japanese officers and soldiers. The same situation exists in other war zones. Hundreds of Japanese officers and soldiers have died in battles with the Eighth Route Army in the Taiyuan area alone. It is reported that a large number of Japanese secret agents, who were originally active in Manchuria and North China before the Japanese surrender, have now joined the Chinese secret police and Chinese secret service agencies. Some members of the Japanese secret service agencies have recently been employed in various American institutions in China.
