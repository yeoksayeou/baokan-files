I Compromisingly Implement the Nanjing Agreement
200,000 People Along the River Commence Work
The Masses, Disregarding Production, Rush to Repair; Labor and Food are Lacking, Enduring Hunger and Borrowing Grain.
[Dispatch from This Newspaper] After the Nanjing Agreement, although it was the wheat harvest season, the masses along the river in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, mostly disregarding production, under the leadership of the democratic government, started work ahead of schedule on the 26th of last month to restore the dikes, and on the 10th of this month, work commenced on a large scale along the entire line. The repair projects in the First, Second, and Fourth Special Districts have completed a portion, with 50,000 people working in the First Special District alone, completing over 390,000 cubic feet of earthwork in five days. In the Fourth Sub-district, the situation of 20,000 people from Neihuang, Kunwu, Changyuan, and Weihe counties participating in the dike restoration is particularly enthusiastic. After receiving the notice to start work on the 27th of last month, 700 people from the Seventh District of Kunwu set off that night. On the eve of the work commencement on the 28th, the masses in various villages spontaneously launched a blitz competition, guaranteeing to make the work solid according to the prescribed standards and complete the work on schedule. Cadres such as Li Jingjin and Yu Changgui of the First Detachment took the lead in setting a model, pushing soil and driving piles all day long with bare backs and sweating. Wang Gouhuang from Gaotai Village pushed 20 carts of soil in a row, competing with three people alone. Even Wang Hexi, who used to be a loafer, was particularly active in this dike restoration, to show his transformation. The First and Third Detachments competed to be the first, getting up in the middle of the night to work, completing 2,300 cubic feet of earthwork in two and a half days, and the government awarded them each a banner. Eight thousand workers in Neihuang County brought their own tools and grain and started work on the 27th. The masses left in the village organized mutual aid to carry out daily production. The entire village of Liu Village newly organized six mutual aid groups, and the autumn seedlings in the entire village have been mostly weeded. The First District of Weihe mobilized 2,000 workers to work, and the portion of the young and middle-aged left in the village cooperated with semi-able-bodied laborers to organize large-scale mutual aid to avoid wasting production. Currently, the enthusiasm of the masses along the river to participate in the dike restoration is increasing daily. However, because the Kuomintang side does not follow the Nanjing Agreement to guarantee the supply of equipment and materials, hindering the rapid progress of the project, the masses have great doubts about the Kuomintang's sincerity in implementing the agreement. However, the masses recognize that dike restoration is a work of self-help and saving others, and while requesting the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Executive Headquarters to quickly allocate wages and food, they are launching a movement to borrow grain and firewood. For example, at the mass meeting in Dongwangza Village, the Fourth District of Neihuang, more than 20 people automatically lent 700 pounds of grain and 1,500 pounds of firewood on the spot, and the trader Liu Jinan voluntarily donated 500 yuan for vegetable expenses.

    我委曲求全执行南京协议
    沿河廿万人大动工
    群众不顾生产，纷起抢修，工粮缺乏，忍饥借粮。
    【本报讯】南京协议后，虽时届麦收，冀鲁豫沿河群众多不顾生产即在民主政府领导下，于上月二十六日提前开工复堤，并于本月十日全线大动工，第一、二、四专区之修补工程已完成一部，仅一专区即有五万群众上工，五天内突击完成三十九万余方土，四分区内黄、昆吾、长垣、卫河等县二万群众，参加复堤情形，尤为热烈。昆吾七区七百群众，上月二十七日接到动工的通知后，当夜启程出发，廿八日晚上工前夜各村群众自动发起突击竞赛，保证照规定标准把工做得坚固，按期完工。第一分队李进京、于长光等干部，首起模范作用，整日赤背汗流推土打桩。皋台村王狗黄，一连推土二十车，一个人与三个人比赛。即过去是二流子的王合喜，此次复堤作工亦特别积极，以表示自己的转变。第一、三分队互相争先，半夜起床作工，两日半即完成二千三百方土，政府各颁予奖旗一面。内黄县八千工人自带用具及粮食，于二十七日上工，留在村中的群众，则组织互助，进行日常生产，刘村全村新组织六个互助组，全村秋苗已大部锄完。卫河第一区动员二千工人做工，留在村内的部分青壮年，配合半劳动力组织大互助，以免荒废生产。现沿河群众参加复堤热潮正日益高涨。但由于国民党方面不按照南京协议，保证器材物资的供给，妨碍工程迅速进行，群众对国民党执行协议的诚意发生极大怀疑。惟群众认清复堤为自救救人之工作，一面要求联总行总急速拨发工资工粮，一面发动借粮借柴运动。如内黄四区东王杂村群众大会上，即有二十余人当场自动借出粮食七百斤，柴一千五百斤，交易员刘金安自动捐菜金五百元。
