An Overview of the Mass Movement in the Taiyue Region

Since the Taiyue region boldly mobilized the masses last winter, the struggle for the liberation of the masses has been universally launched in various areas. The scale and depth of the movement have exceeded any previous year. According to statistics for the entire region (excluding Qin County, Anyi, and Anbei counties), as of the end of May, 82% of the villages had launched a struggle for liberation. The Fourth Sub-region reached 90%. The rent reduction movement in the old liberated areas of Qinyuan, Anze, Jishi, Tumin, Qinshui, and Yangcheng counties has become widespread in all villages. It is currently turning to a large-scale production movement and continuing to delve into mountain villages and small valleys to carry out rent reduction. In the newly liberated areas of Jincheng, Changzi, Zhaocheng, Yicheng, Linfen, Yuanqu, Wangwu, Jiyuan, Gaoping and other counties and villages, all or most have been involved in the anti-traitor and grievance-telling movement. Some counties have largely shifted to rent reduction and debt liquidation (such as Changzi), and most counties have some villages that have shifted to rent reduction and debt liquidation or are in the process of shifting.

Through the mass liberation struggle, the masses have recovered many lands, grains, and properties illegally extorted and plundered from traitors, local bullies, landlords, gentry, and usurers. According to incomplete statistics from counties in the Second Sub-region, 22,159 mu of land, 37,105 shi of grain, and 479 head of livestock were recovered, withdrawn, and returned (other items were not counted). Statistics from Yangcheng, Yicheng, Tunliu, Changzi, Xiaxian and other five counties show that 88,000 mu of land and 150,000 shi of grain were recovered, withdrawn, and returned, which has generally improved the lives of farmers who originally had no or little land. According to statistics from eight villages in Changzi, wealthy middle peasants increased from 34 households to 55 households, middle peasants increased from 464 households to 915 households, poor peasants decreased from 638 households to 389 households, and the extremely poor decreased from 189 households to 7 households. Through the mass liberation struggle, farmers' associations have been rapidly expanded: Yuanqu developed 3,322 members, Xiangling developed 2,100 members, and Changzi developed to 25,000 members. Village-level farmers' associations have been universally established. Militia and other forms of mass armed forces have also been universally established and rapidly developed: in Anze's Sixth District, the number of militia combatants increased from 20 to 128, Xiangling newly developed 330 militiamen, Yuanqu militia developed to 1,180 people, and Changzi developed to 4,684 people. The masses in various places universally demanded weapons. Some received them from the Armed Forces Committee, some bought them themselves, some borrowed them from the army, some polished and used ancient swords, spears, and guns, and some made their own stone mines and hand grenades, or transformed old ones for use, demonstrating infinite creativity. The masses in the Fourth District of Pinglu have eliminated small groups of bandits several times, and many areas have organized joint defense (along transportation lines) and river defense (along the Fen River and Yellow River) to stubbornly resist the Yan-puppet-stubborn forces that harass them from time to time.

The mass struggle has put spiritual pressure on reactionary elements. A Xiangling Yan's agent dared not publicly speak on stage at the anti-Soviet and anti-Communist conference held by Yan's forces, fearing that the masses would settle accounts with them in the future.

Traitors, Kuomintang secret agents, local bullies, and landlords, who were knocked down from their "thrones" of power, have used all kinds of despicable means to hinder the mass liberation struggle. Reactionary elements in Wenxi provoked village-to-village struggles and factional struggles within villages, which even developed into mutual beatings, but the peasants quickly realized that "farmers everywhere are one family" and united to fight against the instigators. Some saboteurs attempted to buy off cadres and activists, but were rejected and exposed. Hongdong discovered that reactionary elements were trying to replace genuine struggle with fake struggle by secretly replacing the beams and pillars, but the eyes of the masses quickly pierced through their scheme. The masses quickly left the side of the reactionary elements and united to carry out an independent struggle. The landlord in Wuyadi, Linfen, organized backward masses to beat advanced masses, but in the end, the masses became aware, united, and overthrew the instigators.

The liberated peasants everywhere are filled with joy and excitement. They turned the process of their liberation into ballads and sang them, turned them into dramas to perform, some held large rallies to exhibit their creations and improved weapons, and exhibited victorious items such as songs and paintings, as well as things returned by traitors and local bullies. Some even set a Liberation Day anniversary. A Jincheng folk song says: "Ji Zheng Huan (a temple), a good place, pine and cypress grow on stone slabs; open the stone slabs and see, they actually grow on the bodies of the poor." This shows that their consciousness has been greatly improved. Other folk songs say: "If it's a dragon, grab one of its feet; if it's a tiger, pull out one of its teeth." "Since we're doing plastering, we're not afraid of muddy clothes." This demonstrates their courage and determination to fight.

In the liberation struggle, the leadership created many experiences. The most basic are "boldly letting go" and "concentrating the use of strength." But each area also has its own different specific experiences and creations. The experience of Pingyao, Tunliu, and other counties is to promote the universal development of struggles in various villages through joint struggles of several or even dozens of villages. Pingyao also organized cadres, masses, and militiamen from the old liberated areas to support and mobilize the masses in the new and marginal areas; to lead and promote the spontaneous struggles of the masses, so that the struggles could develop rapidly; when carrying out struggles in a base point, absorb activists from nearby villages to participate in discussions, deployments, large meetings, small meetings, reports, and summaries, so that they could absorb experience and return to their villages to lead; Pingyao, Jiyuan, and other counties have a wealth of experience in training activists to promote the movement. Pinglu used liberation competitions and exhibition conferences to promote work. Hongdong transformed the fake struggle manipulated by saboteurs into a genuine mass liberation struggle. Yuanqu transformed the infighting of peasants provoked and manipulated by the rulers into a struggle of peasants united against the rulers. Yicheng, through educating and salvaging degenerate cadres, launched a struggle against those who bought off and instigated, breaking the instigators' conspiracy to seize the masses under the pretext of opposing degenerate cadres. In terms of struggle methods, Quwo created "one person proposes, everyone judges"; "everyone discusses well, and each person goes to the struggle target to reason and resolve"; "using a large meeting to solve problems that a few people cannot solve." From the perspective of the entire movement, Jincheng is at the forefront, creating typical and systematic experiences for the entire region. Yangcheng and Changzi have also been relatively fully mobilized.

However, at this time when the mass movement is deepening, some ideological and work style issues in leadership must be resolved. According to the self-criticism of Yuanqu, Jincheng, and other counties, some villages and districts still have a misinterpretation of the "letting go" policy in terms of leadership policy. For example, there is a theory that "the county cannot manage the district, the district cannot manage the village, and the village cadres cannot manage the common people." This means no leadership, letting it flow freely, and as a result, under the guidance of this "free-flow theory," there was indiscriminate struggle that did not distinguish between major and minor issues and priorities. Some produced pure economism, which isolated the farmers' associations, which is not right. In terms of leadership methods, some areas still cannot implement "coming from the masses." For example, some cadres in the Sixth District of Jincheng led the masses to find the "root of poverty," but instead of guiding the masses to find it from their own life experiences, the cadres "found it for them" and kept preaching, so the masses could not become conscious. In terms of organizational work, partial sectarianism occurred in Yuanqu and other counties, keeping the broad masses outside the farmers' associations. The above phenomena exist in varying degrees in various places and should be continuously overcome in the movement to make the movement more in-depth.

    太岳区群运概述
    太岳自去冬放手发动群众以来，群众的翻身斗争在各地区都普遍展开了，运动规模之宏大与深入程度，均超过以往任何一年。全区统计（缺沁县、安邑、安北三县），截至五月底止，掀起翻身斗争的村庄达到百分之八十二。四分区达到百分之九十。老解放区沁源、安泽、冀氏、土敏、沁水、阳城等县之查减运动，已普遍到全部村庄。目前正转向大生产运动，并继续深入到山庄小沟进行查减。新解放区之晋城、长子、赵城、翼城、临汾、垣曲、王屋、济源、高平等县村庄，亦已全部或绝大部分卷入反奸诉苦运动。有的县已大部转入减租清债（如长子），多数县份都有部分村庄转入减租清债，或正在转。
    经过群众翻身斗争，群众从汉奸、恶霸、地主、豪绅、高利贷者们手里把非法讹诈与剥夺去的许多土地、粮食、财物等，都清算回来。据二分区各县不完全统计，算回、抽回和退回土地二二一五九亩，粮食三七一○五石，牲口四七九头（其他未计）。阳城、翼城、屯留、长子、夏县等五县统计，算回、抽回和退回土地八万八千亩，粮食十五万石，这使原来没地与少地的农民普遍得到生活的改善。据长子八个村统计，富裕中农由三十四户增至五十五户，中农由四六四户增至九一五户，贫农则由六三八户减至三八九户，赤贫由一八九户减至七户。经过群众翻身斗争，农会得到迅速扩大：垣曲发展三三二二人，襄陵发展二一○○人，长子发展到二万五千人。村级农会已普遍建立起来。民兵与其他形式的群众武装，也普遍建立，迅速发展：安泽六区民兵战斗队员由二十人发展到一百二十八人，襄陵新发展民兵三百三十人，垣曲民兵发展到一千一百八十人，长子发展到四千六百八十四人。各地群众普遍要求武器。有的向武委会领取，有的自动购买，有的向军队借用，有的把古时的刀剑矛枪都擦亮使用，还有的自制石雷、手榴弹，或改造旧的来使用，发挥了无穷的创造力。平陆四区群众曾数次将小股土匪消灭，不少地区已组织联防（交通沿线）、河防（汾河和黄河边），对不时袭扰的阎伪顽进行顽强抵抗。
    群众斗争，给了反动分子们以精神上的压迫，襄陵阎部特务在阎部召开的反苏反共会议上，不敢公开上台讲话，怕群众将来算账。
    从统治“宝座”上被打落下来的汉奸、国特、恶霸地主们，曾用一切卑污手段来阻碍群众翻身斗争。闻喜的反动分子，挑动村与村斗争，一村人这派与那派斗争，以至发展到互相殴打，但农民很快觉悟到“天下农民是一家”，大家联合起来斗争了挑拨者；有的破坏者企图用收买干部与积极分子的办法，但被拒绝并揭发了，洪洞曾发现反动分子偷梁换柱，弄假斗争代替真斗争，但终被群众的眼睛戮破了。群众很快从反动分子身边离开，自己团结起来进行独立的斗争。临汾五雅地主曾组织落后群众殴打先进群众，最后群众觉悟了，团结起来，斗倒了挑拨者。
    各地翻了身的农民，充清着欢欣鼓舞情绪。他们把翻身的经过编成歌谣唱着，编成戏剧来表演，有的开大会展览自己创造和改良了的武器，创作的歌与画，也展览胜利品，如汉奸、恶霸们退还了的东西。有的规定了翻身纪念日。晋城民谣说：“吉正欢（一寺庙），好地方，松柏长在石板上；揭开石板看看，却长在穷人身上。”这表现他们的觉悟性已大大提高。另一些民谣说：“是龙扳他一只脚，是虎拔他一只牙。”“既当泥水匠，不怕泥衣裳。”这又表现了他们的斗争勇气与决心。
    在翻身斗争中，领导上创造了不少经验。最基本的是“大胆放手”与“集中使用力量”。但各地又有其不同的具体体验与创造。平遥、屯留等县的经验，是用数村以至数十村的联合斗争来推动各村普遍开展斗争，平遥并组织老区的干部群众与民兵去支援与发动新区及边沿区群众；领导与推动群众自发的斗争，使斗争迅速发展；在一个基点开展斗争时，吸收附近村积极分子来参加讨论、布置、大会、小会、汇报、总结，使他们吸取经验，回村领导；平遥、济源等县，则有大量训练积极分子，推动运动的经验。平陆用翻身比赛展览大会推进工作。洪洞把破坏分子操纵的假斗争，转变为真正群众的翻身斗争。垣曲把统治者挑拨与操纵的农民互斗，转变为农民联合向统治者斗争。翼城经过教育与挽救蜕化干部，展开了对收买挑拨者的斗争，打破挑拨者想借口反对蜕化干部而掌握群众的阴谋。在斗争方式上，曲沃创造了“一人提出，大家评理”；“大家讨论好，各人自己去找斗争对象说理，解决”；“用大会解决少数人不能解决的问题”等。从整个运动看来，晋城是走在最前面，创造了全区的典型，系统的经验。阳城、长子，也发动得比较充分。
    但是，在目前群运正在深入时期，有一些领导思想与作风上的问题必须求得解决。据垣曲、晋城等县自己检讨，在领导方针上，有些村区还存在着对“放手”方针的曲解。譬如有一种理论说：“县不能管区，区不能管村，村干部不能管老百姓。”意思就是不要领导，任其白流，结果在这种“自流论”指导下，产生了不分主要次要和轻重缓急的乱斗，有的是产生了单纯经济主义，使农会陷于孤立，这是不对的。领导方法上，有些地区还不能实行“从群众中来”。如晋城六区有些干部领导群众找“穷根”，不是诱导群众从自己生活经验中去找，而是干部“代找”，一直说教，结果是群众不能自觉。垣曲等县在组织工作上，部分的发生关门主义，把广大群众关在农会之外。以上现象，在各地多少都是有的，应在运动中不断加以克服，使运动更加走向深入。
