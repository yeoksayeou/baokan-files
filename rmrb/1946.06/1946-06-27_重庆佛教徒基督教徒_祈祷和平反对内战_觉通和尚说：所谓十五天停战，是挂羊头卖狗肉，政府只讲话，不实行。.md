Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd. Buddhist believers in Chongqing, such as Grand Master Ruchu and Huang Mohan, initiated the Chongqing Buddhist Community's Prayer Meeting for Peace. A peace prayer was held at Chang'an Temple on the 12th, and letters were sent to Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman Mao, and Marshal Marshall, appealing to transform the fifteen-day temporary ceasefire into a permanent ceasefire to secure the people's livelihood. The letter to Chiang Kai-shek began by stating: "Victory has been achieved, but civil war immediately broke out, causing factories to close, farms to stop plowing, students to strike, and courts to cease functioning. With just one wrong move, a hundred disasters arise." It also stated: "Political issues should be resolved through political means. Please do not resort to military force, which would plunge the people into misery and repeat the catastrophe. We respectfully submit this letter to you, hoping you will consider our humble intentions, permanently cease fire, and establish peace." The letter to Chairman Mao stated: "We believe that you have led the nation in the War of Resistance, achieving remarkable feats." It also stated: "We only hope that this ceasefire will be a permanent ceasefire, and this peace will be a lasting peace." The letter to Marshall stated: "Although the government has issued a fifteen-day ceasefire order, the war has not only not stopped as a result but has intensified and expanded." It continued: "The Chinese people do not need war, especially not this kind of war. Therefore, we hope for a permanent ceasefire, with everything resolved through negotiation. If we cannot reach an agreement in one day, we will talk again the next day; if we cannot reach an agreement in one month, we will talk again the second month. In any case, we must resolve it peacefully. Otherwise, the peace of China and the peace of the world are difficult to imagine." Finally, it declared: "China needs peace, and the world needs peace. This consultation is only allowed to succeed and not allowed to fail. We hope that you will take responsibility and advocate forcefully." Each letter was signed by Huang Mohan, Liu Foxin, Gan Lunyuan, Li Juenong, Zhu Yuangu, and others, as the initiators of the Chongqing Buddhist Community's Prayer Meeting for Peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd. Following the peace prayer of Buddhists in Chongqing, Christians in Chongqing also held a peace prayer meeting on the 16th. In the morning, prayers were conducted separately in fifteen churches, and in the afternoon, a joint prayer was held at the YMCA, and a telegram was passed to Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong. Pastor Pi Li of the Buda Church of the Methodist Church on Ciqu Street said during the morning prayer service: "There are many people who disagree with our views, but we should unite with them. The government has many stubborn points and should listen to the opinions of the people." The joint peace prayer meeting was hosted by the Chongqing Christian Association. Leaders or representatives from more than ten churches, including the Congregational Church, YMCA, United Methodist Church, Baptist Church, Church of Christ in China, the Church of Christ, Churches of Christ, London Missionary Society, China Inland Mission, Methodist Church, Anglican Church, Presbyterian Church, Salvation Army, Red Cross, YWCA, YMCA association, Si'en Church, and the Methodist Episcopal Church, attended. The venue was crowded with people, including the elderly, women, children, and allied friends. The conference began with "Appeal to God" and singing "Savior of Peace," followed by Pastor Luo Gehuan's "Prayer" and the "Special Prayer" by church members of Yixun Girls' High School. Then, Chen Chonggui, President of Chongqing Theological Seminary, "preached." Pastor Chen solemnly recited: "Today, we gather before God to pray for peace for the country and the world. We pray for peace and need to know that peace comes from fairness, peace is the branch, and fairness is the root. Without fairness, there is no peace." Subsequently, Pastor Bai Langran and Pastors Zhu and Huang successively conducted "Prayers for Domestic Peace and Unity" and "Prayers for World Peace." Pastor Zhu exclaimed in his prayer: "Lord! Our compatriots across the country have suffered so much pain and various oppressions during these eight years of resistance that it has reached an unbearable and extremely difficult point!" Pastor Huang pointed out in his prayer: "There have been a few ignorant leaders in the world who are warmongering and want to rule the world with violence. Although they were once prominent, they eventually brought about their own destruction. It can be seen that violence cannot overcome truth. Although the chief culprit has been eliminated, the remaining poison still exists. Although the organization has been disbanded, the ideology has not been cleansed. As a result, the world today is still in an unstable state. Some people have abandoned the teachings of the Heavenly Father and only make selfish plans; some people have forgotten the lessons of the past and are still preparing for killings. How dangerous this is! We pray to the Lord to make their hearts pure and their vision broad, to abandon selfishness, to uphold justice, and to resolve all issues before our Father's righteousness, in a way that benefits both oneself and others." The conference then read out telegrams to Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong, followed by a hymn "Blessing" by the entire congregation, and then adjourned in a solemn atmosphere.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 24th. Christian and Buddhist figures here recently spoke to reporters from the Xinhua Daily, all expressing their deep aversion to civil war and demanding peace. Mr. Chen Wenyuan, General Secretary of the National Christian Council of China, said: "The demands of our non-partisan religious figures, like the people across the country, are very simple. We only want to live and work in peace, have food to eat, roads to walk, and things to do, but today we still have to face family separation and suffer all kinds of hardships in life. The Chinese nation is the most tolerant nation in the world, but there is a limit to tolerance... We sincerely pray for the success of the negotiations and the realization of peace." Mr. Huang Cixian, General Secretary of the YMCA, said: "The people across the country are hoping that this ceasefire can truly lead to peace. If fifteen days of negotiations are not enough, then another fifteen days should be added to achieve lasting peace and build a modern country." Teacher Luo Dingxing said: "From my religious standpoint, we demand long-term peace, not the kind of limited-time and limited-area peace that Ta Kung Pao talks about. Our only hope today is to achieve peaceful unification through consultation." Ms. Bian Xusun, General Secretary of the Chongqing YWCA, said: "If the civil war continues, it will not be good for the people. I originally planned to leave here and go home in May, but Chairman Chiang issued an order to suspend transportation for two months, traffic was blocked, and I couldn't leave." Therefore, she said: "Standing from the Christian standpoint, we yearn for peace and seek peace." Dr. Shi Yufang, Dean of Academic Affairs of the West China Theological Seminary, said: "The current problems of China cannot be solved by war. The people do not want war, what the people want is peace." Mr. Yang Yongqing, President of the Anglican Church, said: "We demand that swords be sheathed and that the people live in a peaceful society forever." Buddhist figures also unanimously pointed out that the civil war cannot continue, and everyone opposes the civil war. Abbot Juetong said: "Now the world is in turmoil, wave after wave, and each wave is more ferocious. The purpose of my Buddha is to make all beings on earth live in peace. The so-called fifteen-day ceasefire is a case of 'selling dog meat under a sheep's head,' the government only talks but does not act. For example, it is said that there will be no grain requisition, but then it is requisitioned again. Speaking without seeking truth is what Buddhism opposes." Shi Xinming said: "The government should have compassion for the people. The standard of a person is compassion, and without it, one is not human. We must show compassion and quell the war. Everyone should discuss it well and make China a better place, and there should be no more wars." Shi Yandi used the two characters of "heshang" (monk) to explain: "Everything should be based on harmony." Shi Zengtai said: "The civil war cannot continue. Everyone opposes the civil war. From my view of the Buddha's doctrine, the world needs to be peaceful. If the civil war continues, everyone's life will get worse, and even monks who have left home cannot escape."

　　重庆佛教徒基督教徒
    祈祷和平反对内战
    觉通和尚说：所谓十五天停战，是挂羊头卖狗肉，政府只讲话，不实行。
    【新华社延安二十三日电】渝市佛教信徒如初大法师黄墨涵等，特发起重庆佛化同人祈祷和平法会。于十二日在长安寺举行和平祈祷，并上书蒋介石毛主席与马歇尔元帅，呼吁将十五天的暂时停战，变为永久的停战，以安民生。上蒋介石书中首称：“胜利已得，内战旋即展开，以致工厂停业，农庄停耕，学生罢课，法院罢职。举乖一端，灾害百出。”并称：“政治问题应以政治方式解决，幸勿以兵戎相见，致使人民涂炭，重罹浩劫。特上书我公，俯察微意，永远停战，奠定和平。”上毛主席书中内称：“伏念我公领导民族抗战，伟绩卓著。”并称：“惟望此一停战，永久停战，此一和平，永庆和平。”上马歇尔书中，内称：“虽然政府已经颁布了十五天停战的命令，可是战争不但没有因此停止，反而加剧和扩大起来。”继称：“中国人民是不需要战争，尤其不需要这样的战争。因此我们希望永久停战，一切都用商谈的方式。一天谈不好，第二天再谈，一月谈不好，第二月再谈。无论如何都要以和平的方式解决。否则中国的和平与世界和平便很难想象。”最后声称：“中国需要和平，世界需要和平。此次协商只许成功，不许失败。望先生负起责任，为有力之主张。”各书末，均书名为重庆佛化同仁祈祷和平法会首士黄墨涵、刘佛信、甘轮圆、李觉侬、朱原古等。
    【新华社重庆二十三日电】继重庆佛教徒的祈祷和平，重庆基督教徒亦于十六日举行祈祷和平大会。上午由十五个教堂分别进行祈祷，下午在青年会举行联合祈祷，并通过致蒋介石毛泽东电。磁器街卫理公会布达堂牧师砒理于上午祈祷礼中称：“有许多与我们主张不同的人，但是我们应该与他们团结。政府有许多固执的地方，应当听取人民的意见。”联合的和平祈祷大会，系由渝市基督教协进会主持。到公理会、青年会、中美会、浸信会、中华教会、基督所、基督会、伦敦会、内地会、卫理会、圣公会、长老会、救世军、十字会、女青年会、青年协会、思恩堂、美以美会等十余教会的负责人或代表。会场中拥满人群，其中包括老年人、妇女、小孩子、及盟友。大会于“吁神”唱“救世太平歌”，罗革寰牧师的“祈祷”及懿训女中教友的“特别祈祷”后，即由重庆神学院院长陈崇桂“讲道”。陈牧师庄严地诵读着：“我们今天聚集在神面前，为国家为世界祈求和平。我们祈祷和平，需要知道和平是从公平而来，和平是枝叶，公平是根本。没有公平，即没有和平。”接着由柏浪然牧师及朱牧师、黄牧师等相继进行“为国内和平统一祈祷”，与“为世界和平祈祷”。朱牧师于祈祷中唤出：“主啊！我们全国同胞在这抗战八年间，所受的痛苦及各种的压迫，已经到了忍无可忍，万分难支持的时候了！”黄氏祈祷中指出：“世界上曾有少数愚昧领袖，黩武好战，妄想以暴力统治天下，虽曾显赫一时，终归自取灭亡。可见暴力不能战胜真理。然元凶虽除，遗毒犹存。组织虽解，思想未净。致今日的世界，尚在不安状态中。有人抛弃天父的教训，专作自私的打算；有人忘掉前车的鉴戒，尚作残杀的准备。这是如何危险的事！？我们祈祷主，叫他们的心灵纯洁，眼光远大，放弃私图，维护公理，一切问题均在我父公义的面前，以利己利他的方法求得解决”。大会在宣读致蒋介石及毛泽东通电，再由全体唱诗“祝福”后，便在庄严的空气中散会。
    【新华社重庆二十四日电】此间基督教和佛教人士，日前对新华日报记者谈话，都表示深厌内战，要求和平。中华民国基督教协会总干事陈文渊先生说：“我们无党无派的宗教人士的要求，和全国人民一样，都很简单，我们只要能安居乐业，有饭吃，有路走，有事作，但今天却还要妻离子散，受着生活上的百般痛苦。中华民族是全世界最能忍耐的民族，但是忍耐也有一定的限度……，我们诚心的祈祷谈判的成功，和平的实现。”青年会总干事黄次咸先生说：“全国人民莫不盼望这次停战真能达到和平，如果十五天商谈不够，再来一个十五天，以期达到永久和平，建设一个现代化的国家。”罗定兴教师说：“从我的宗教立场来说，我们要求长期的和平，而不是象大公报所说那种时间有限的地域有限的和平。我们今天唯一的期望，就是经过协商，达到和平统一”。重庆女青年会总干事卞煦孙女士说：“内战打下去，对人民总是不好的。我本来打算五月间离此回家，蒋委员长下手令停运两月，交通阻滞，我也走不动了”。因此她说：“我们站在基督教的立场说，是渴望和平企求和平”。华西大学神学院教务长施煜芳博士说：“目前中国的问题，不能用战争的方法去解决，人民不要战争，人民所要的是和平”。圣公会会长杨永清先生说：“我们要求收刀入鞘，让人民永远生活在和平的社会中”。佛教人士也一致指出内战不能再打，人人都反对内战。觉通和尚说：“现在世界民不聊生，一浪翻一浪，浪浪更凶，我佛宗旨，大地众生，人人安活。所谓十五天停战，是挂羊头卖狗肉，政府只讲话，不实行。譬如说了不征粮，又要征，说话不求真实，是佛教所反对的”。释心明说：“政府对人民，要有慈悲心。人的标准是慈悲心，无则不是人。我们要拿出慈悲心，把战争平息下去。大家好好商量，把中国弄好，再不要发生战争”。释演谛以和尚二字说明：“一切以和为尚”。释增泰说：“内战不能再打下去了，人人都是反对内战，我本众佛陀主义的看法，世界要安宁，内战再打，一切人的生活还要坏下去，连出了家的僧胞，也跑不脱”。
