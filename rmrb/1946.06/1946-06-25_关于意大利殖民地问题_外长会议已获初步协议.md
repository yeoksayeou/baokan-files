Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd. Paris dispatch: The Four Foreign Ministers began discussing the Trieste issue on the 21st. The entire Italian-Yugoslav border and the Dodecanese issue were also brought up for discussion simultaneously, but the details are not yet known. It is also reported that the discussion on the Italian colonies issue on the 20th has reached the following compromise: The four foreign ministers will appoint a four-person committee to specifically study Benes' proposal made at the last Paris conference on how to handle the Italian colonies issue. This proposal advocated that Italy should abandon its colonies. As for the administration of these colonies, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France should jointly be responsible. The four countries will continue to consult on a solution to this issue within a year. If there is still no agreement after one year, the issue will be submitted to the United Nations Trusteeship Council for resolution. Regarding the relationship between this solution and the signing of the overall peace treaty with Italy, it is rumored that the four powers are seeking a way to prepare a peace treaty with Italy without considering the colonies issue. At the meeting on the 20th, an agreement was reached on the following issue: After the peace treaty with Italy is signed, a committee composed of the ambassadors of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France stationed in Italy will supervise the implementation of the peace treaty with Italy within twelve months.
