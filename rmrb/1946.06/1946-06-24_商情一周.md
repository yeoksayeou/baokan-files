　　Business Conditions Weekly

　　Over the past week, prices in various border areas have generally remained stable. Prices in Handan have risen slightly. Imported goods such as "City Cloth," "Welfare Blue" cloth, and kerosene have maintained a firm upward trend. On June 21st, "City Cloth" was priced at 27,500 yuan per bolt, nearly 10,000 yuan higher than the previous week. "Welfare Blue" cloth was priced at 17,500 yuan per jin, 5,000 yuan higher than the previous week. This was due to the Kuomintang's blockade against us, leading to a shortage of goods from the interior. The upward trend weakened slightly towards the weekend. On June 22nd, "Welfare Blue" cloth had already fallen back to 16,500 yuan, and "City Cloth" had also fallen back to 25,500 yuan. The general expectation is that the future will be stable. As for grains: In Jincheng, Taiyue, on June 15th, wheat was priced at 22.3 yuan per jin, and millet was priced at 21.4 yuan per jin, an increase of two to three yuan compared to the previous week; In Heze on June 19th, wheat was priced at 400 to 430 yuan per dou (double official dou); In Handan this week, wheat was priced as high as 34 yuan per jin and as low as 29 yuan, while millet was priced as high as 35 yuan per jin and as low as 31 yuan, an increase of five to six yuan compared to the previous week.

　　In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, commodity prices are falling because the National Government is desperately suppressing the price of gold and grain in order to seize the new wheat at low prices. On June 18th, wheat in Tianjin was priced at 376 yuan per jin, and millet was priced at 130 yuan, a decrease of 50 yuan for wheat and 70 yuan for millet compared to June 16th.

　　The financial situation in the border region's interior is calm. The exchange rates posted by the Handan Bank remain the same as last week: the buying price for fiat currency is 0.21 yuan, and the selling price is 0.215 yuan; the buying price for Customs Gold Units is 4.2 yuan, and the selling price is 4.3 yuan; gold is priced at 53,000 yuan per tael. The number of transactions this week remains substantial. Yinan Bank alone transacted 174 taels of gold, over 84,000 silver dollars, and 1,275 taels of silver. Elsewhere, in Heze, silver dollars are exchanged at 250 yuan per dollar, and in Jincheng on June 15th, gold is priced at 53,000 yuan per tael, and silver dollars are exchanged at 250 yuan, all remaining stable.

　　商情一周
    一周以来，边区各地物价一般仍然平稳。邯郸稍涨，市布、福利青、煤油等外来品挺势坚，二十一日白市布每匹二万七千五百元，比上周涨近一万元，福利青每斤一万七千五百元，比上周涨五千元，原因是国民党区对我封锁，内地货缺；周末涨势稍挫，二十二日福利青已回跌到一万六千五百元，市布也回跌到二万五千五百元，一般估计前途看平。粮食类：太岳晋城十五日小麦每斤二十二元三角，小米每斤二十一元四角，比上周涨两三元；荷泽十九日小麦每斗（双官斗）四百元至四百三十元；邯郸本周小麦每斤最高三十四元，最低二十九元，小米每斤最高三十五元，最低三十一元，比上周上升五六元。
    国民党统治区物价由于国民政府拚命的压低金价，粮价，以便低价掠夺新麦，本月十八日天津小麦每斤三百七十六元，小米一百三十元，较十六日小麦跌五十元，小米跌七十元。
    边区内地金融行情平静，邯郸银行挂牌仍保持上周行情：法币买价二角一分，卖价二角一分五；关金买价四元二角，卖价四元三角，赤金每两五万三千元，本周成交数仍然不少，仅翼南银行一家赤金成交一百七十四两，银元八万四千余元，纹银一千二百七十五两。其他各地行情荷泽银元每元兑二百五十元，晋城十五日赤金每两五万三千元，银元二百五十元，均呈平稳。
