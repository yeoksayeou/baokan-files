　　Demolishing Fortifications and Relieving Workers
    Zaozhuang Order Quickly Restored
    [Xinhua News Agency, Teng County, 20th] Since our army liberated Zaozhuang on the 10th and disbanded the puppet army of the big traitor Wang Jimei of the Zhongxing Company who was entrenched there, all the people of southern Shandong have been overjoyed and encouraged, and the citizens of Zaozhuang have enthusiastically celebrated. Now, under the active leadership of our democratic government, Zaozhuang City has quickly restored peace and order, and is actively assisting the Zhongxing Company to step up production. The Zaozhuang Mining Workers' Union of the Shandong Copper Mine Area General Union and the Zaozhuang District Workers' Department Mining Bureau have successively distributed 150,000 Northern Currency (each Northern Currency equals 20 Legal Tender) and 2,000 jin of grain to relieve the employees of Zhongxing Company. On the 15th, they even sent more than 50 trade union cadres to assist in the relief work. On the same day, 69 worker households received relief. The employees happily said, "The traitor Wang Jimei watched us workers starve to death, but as soon as the Communist Party and our democratic government arrived, they provided relief and assistance to us." After the workers were liberated and received relief, their enthusiasm for work doubled. The machine workers stepped up the repair of machines, and the workers in the repair shop repaired a train that was destroyed by the traitor Wang on the first night of resumption of work. That night, the whistle of the train sounded under the bright electric lights. The manager and workers of Zhongxing Company expressed their great admiration for the strict discipline of our army when it entered the company and the fact that the machines were not damaged in the slightest. All the fortifications built by the traitor Wang Jimei in the Zhongxing Company have been quickly dismantled and demolished by the people under the leadership of the democratic government, and the streets have been cleared to facilitate pedestrians. The citizens have also rushed to repair the houses burned down by Wang Jimei, and businessmen are busy expanding their shops. Everyone in the city is smiling, discussing with each other: "Now we can hold our heads high. With such a strong armed force as the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, we are guaranteed to live a good life." Now the people of the city are preparing to hold a conference to celebrate their liberation.
