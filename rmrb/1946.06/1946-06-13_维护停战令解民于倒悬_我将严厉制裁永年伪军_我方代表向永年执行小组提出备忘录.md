[Report from Our Newspaper in Yongnian on the 10th] The puppet troops in Yongnian City, with the direct support of Kuomintang warmongers, have intensified their provocative attacks against us. Bloody incidents occur frequently, and they attempt to build Yongnian into a military fortress for anti-communism and anti-people activities, a springboard for civil war, in order to coordinate with the Kuomintang's advance in northern and eastern Henan during the Kuomintang's full-scale civil war, thereby encircling and attacking our liberated areas. Wang Yumin, a colonel and the Communist representative in the Yongnian Executive Group, delivered a memorandum to the Yongnian Executive Group on the 10th via Lieutenant Colonel Olson, the American representative. The memorandum stated that since May, Kuomintang troops in the northern and eastern Henan regions, in conjunction with puppet troops, have violated the ceasefire order, intensified civil war measures, besieged our Eighth Route Army in eastern Henan, and occupied most of our villages and towns in northern Henan. The puppet troops in Yongnian City, led by Wang Zemin and others, in order to coordinate with the Kuomintang's offensive in northern and eastern Henan, have repeatedly launched provocations since the arrival of the Yongnian Executive Group on May 15th. The West Dam incident occurred on May 16th, where puppet troops shot and injured our army's auxiliary platoon leader. On May 24th, they killed a resident, Dong Changzi. That night, more than 40 puppet troops attacked Songdi, captured residents Dong Xigui and another, and seized two civilian rifles. Since May 18th, the puppet troops have been building fortifications extensively, demolishing 18 streets in the city, and forcing 2,000 refugees daily to repair the airfield, claiming that Kuomintang troops will land there. Kuomintang planes drop ammunition and food in Yongnian every day. On June 5th, they also dispatched planes carrying military supplies, landing 10 li north of Yongnian City. At 1:30 PM on June 6th, disregarding all morality, they suddenly dispatched two fighter planes to strafe and bomb our troops and civilians fiercely in the northern part of Yongnian City, resulting in 4 deaths and injuries among our stationed troops and 7 deaths and 21 injuries among residents, causing an unprecedentedly serious bloody tragedy. The memorandum also pointed out that we have repeatedly protested against the heinous crimes of the puppet troops and Kuomintang warmongers, but to no avail. This puppet troop, with the direct support of the Kuomintang, has intensified its activities and become even more rampant. The memorandum concludes by firmly stating that our stationed troops in Yongnian, in order to maintain the dignity of the ceasefire order, fight for their own survival, and at the repeated requests of the people, have no choice but to impose severe sanctions on these puppet troops, disarm them, and stop their actions in response to the large-scale offensive of the Kuomintang troops in northern and eastern Henan, in order to liberate the people of Yongnian City who are on the verge of death.
