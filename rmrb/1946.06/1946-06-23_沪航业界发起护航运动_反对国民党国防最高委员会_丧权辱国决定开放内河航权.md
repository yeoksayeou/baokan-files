　　Shanghai Shipping Industry Launches Navigation Protection Movement
    Opposing the Kuomintang National Defense Supreme Council's
    Treacherous Decision to Open Inland Waterway Navigation Rights
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: Shanghai: The shipping industry here is currently launching a navigation protection movement to oppose the Kuomintang National Defense Supreme Council's decision to open inland waterway navigation rights, an act of treachery and national betrayal. The shipping industry held all-day group meetings on the 5th of this month to discuss the matter, and held an emergency meeting on the 6th. In addition to appealing to the government to withdraw its decision, the shipping industries of North China and the Yangtze River region jointly launched a navigation protection movement to safeguard their rights. On the 5th, a senior employee of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company told reporters, "Hankou is the throat of Hubei and Hunan, and the center of the Yangtze River. Allowing foreign ships to enter is no different from inviting a wolf into the house." Li Yunchang, Secretary-General of the Shipping Industry Association, expressed great unease about Song Ziwen's reason for opening inland waterway navigation, namely that ports such as London and Hamburg all allow foreign ships to enter. This is because the aforementioned ports are river ports very close to the sea, which cannot be compared to the heartland of the interior. No country has such a precedent. Li also pointed out that the contracts between Jardine Matheson and Swire Group and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) to transport relief supplies are about to expire (the expiration date is July 15th), and it will be difficult to find an excuse to navigate China's inland rivers. The current move is actually a fundamental encroachment, giving the Chinese shipping industry a fatal blow. Jin Yueshi of Minsheng Company stated that the shipping industry should unite to request the government to withdraw its decision, otherwise all navigation should be suspended.

　　沪航业界发起护航运动
    反对国民党国防最高委员会
    丧权辱国决定开放内河航权
    【新华社延安二十日电】沪讯：此间航业界现正发起护航运动，反对国民党国防最高委员会决定开放内河航权、丧权辱国之举。航业界于本（六）月五日竟日开小组会议讨论，并于六日开紧急会议，除向政府呼吁收回成命外，并由华北与长江的航业界联合发起护航运动，以确保抗权。五日招商局某高级职员对记者称：“汉口乃两湖咽喉，长江重心，政府准许外轮驶入，则无异引狼入室。”航业公会秘书长李云长，宋子文以伦敦、汉堡等港埠俱准外轮进口为开放我国内河航行之理由，至为不安。盖上述港口为离海甚近之河港，非内地心脏地区可比，任何国家，均无此例。李氏并指出怡和、太古两公司与行总订定承运救济物资合同即将期满（按七月十五日期满），本再难借口，航行中国内河，目前之举，实系从根本侵入，予中国航业界以致命打击。民生公司金月石表示，应联合航业界，请求政府收回成命，否则全体停航。
