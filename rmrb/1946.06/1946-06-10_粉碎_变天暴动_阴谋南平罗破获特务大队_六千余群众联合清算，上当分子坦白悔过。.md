[Hui North Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Liu Jingwen, an illegal landlord in Nanpingluo, Hui (County) North, Taihang, colluded with Zhao Quanwu, a traitor and special agent from Panxia (Kuomintang-controlled area), to organize a special agent brigade, plotting a "change the world riot" and establishing a black gun squad, attempting to assassinate active elements in the village, as well as cadres and militiamen leading the masses in their emancipation. These planned sabotage activities by special agents were completely uncovered by the village masses by the end of last month, and a thorough mass anti-traitor movement was launched. As early as the night of March 24th, these special agents took advantage of a village opera performance to openly attack the village armed forces department, attempting to seize guns and start a riot. At the time, the entire village's cadres and masses, as well as the county government organs stationed in the village, were greatly surprised, but many cadres and masses remained paralyzed, believing that the masses in Ping Village had already reduced rent and achieved emancipation, so who would do such a thing? It must have been people from other villages. As a result, the special agent saboteurs were able to lie low in the village and continue their illegal activities. It was not until around May 15th that, during a tenant座谈会 in the village, members of the farmers' association and active militiamen, after discussing with the masses, discovered the activities of Liu Hanzhang, a disguised accomplice saboteur, and firmly demanded to settle accounts with him. Seeing the strength of the masses, Liu Hanzhang lowered his head and confessed. He admitted that under the guise of a "model teacher" and false activist, he had embezzled more than thirty dan of the fruits of the masses' struggle and bought more than twenty mu of land at low prices. He also said that under the bribery and purchase of special agent landlord Zhao Jingwen, he and Zhao helped the traitor Liu Wenfu sell trees and land, sending money to Panxia. Zhao's house also hid hidden guns and "change the world" ledgers. In addition, he revealed that landlords who were active with Zhao still kept the red contract documents for land returned during the rent reduction, and had not handed them over to the peasants... These inside stories immediately aroused the anger and hatred of the masses. On the 23rd, all the tenants in the village went to the landlords' homes in groups of three or five to settle accounts. Under the pressure of the masses, illegal landlord Zhao Suwen returned two hundred and thirty red contracts, one hundred and fifty yuan in silver, and two pistols. Zhang Zhixian handed over three "change the world" ledgers, which recorded everything returned to the masses during the rent and interest reduction (which was what they had illegally plundered from the masses in the past). One ledger even recorded the corvée labor of supporting the front during last year's major counter-offensive. The masses were even more resentful of this. That afternoon, the democratic government, at the request of the masses, legally detained these illegal landlords. On the 25th, over six thousand people in Pingluo 川 jointly settled accounts with these illegal landlords. Liu Hanzhang, Niu Guisuo, and twenty-two other agents who were deceived, feeling grateful for the leniency of our government, confessed the inside story of the special agents to the masses on the spot: it turned out that the special agent organization in Nanpingluo was organized last autumn, with a total of thirty-one people, led by landlord Zhao Jingwen as the captain, Wu Zuzhou as the deputy captain and chief of staff, Zhang Fuxing as the commander of the action middle captain, and subordinate investigators (Gou Lingxiang), secretary (Liu Hanzhang), black gun squad, gun-grabbing squad, and traffic for liaison with puppet troops and traitors. Then Niu Guisuo confessed the incident of attacking the village armed forces department in March. He said: This was all planned by the special agent boss Zhao Jingwen. Zhao also said: The Fourth Brigade (traitor Zhao Quanwu) will come from Panxia tonight to help, to carry out internal and external cooperation, first kill the director of the Armed Forces Committee, the cadres, the county government organs…, saying this, the surge of conscience made Niu cry bitterly. He said: The special agents harmed me. During the famine years, the Kuomintang made it impossible for my whole family to survive, forcing me to flee to Shanxi. The Eighth Route Army democratic government came, and life got better. I got land and also married a wife, but I was afraid of the change of power and was deceived. He clenched his teeth and painfully punched Zhao Jingwen, saying: You dog harmed me! One deceived agent after another tearfully confessed all the dirty things they had done and cursed the harm that the Kuomintang special agents had done to them. Although the weather was so hot, more than six thousand people were always filled with hatred for the Kuomintang special agents who harmed the country and the people, as well as the enthusiasm to patiently save the deceived and misguided elements. Finally, the special agent boss Zhao Jingwen admitted to the masses that he wanted to change the world and take back the interests that were reasonably returned to the peasants during the rent and interest reduction, and admitted to his connection with the traitor Zhao Quanwu. At this time, the government, according to the opinions of the masses, detained Zhao Jingwen for legal processing. The other elements were distinguished by the severity of their crimes and dealt with separately. Finally, the government called on everyone not to be paralyzed, to be a hundred times more vigilant, to combine the defense of the summer harvest, and to further implement the investigation and reduction movement.

    【本报辉北特讯】太行辉（县）北南平罗非法地主刘景文，勾结盘下（国民党统治区）汉奸特务赵全五，组织特务大队，阴谋变天暴动，并成立黑枪班，企图暗害村中积极分子，以及领导群众翻身的干部和民兵，特务分子此种有计划的破坏活动，至上月底，已全部为该村群众所破获，并深入的展开了群众性的反奸运动。早在三月二十四日夜，此等特务即乘全村唱戏之隙，公开袭击村武装部，企图搂枪暴动。当时全村干部群众，以及驻村县府机关，虽曾大吃一惊，但不少干部与群众，仍然表现麻痹，认为平村群众已减租翻了身，谁还干这事？一定是外村人干的。因之特务破坏份子，又得安然潜伏村中，继续其非法活动。直至五月十五日前后，该村佃户座谈会中，农会会员与民兵积极分子，经过与群众酝酿后，才发现伪装的胁从破坏分子刘汉章的活动，坚决要求和他进行清算。刘汉章看到群众力量的强大就低头坦白了。他承认自己在“模范教员”、假积极的外衣掩盖下，贪污了群众斗争果实三十余石，贱价买地二十余亩。他又说在特务地主赵景文的贿赂收买下，他和赵帮助汉奸刘文傅卖树卖地，往盘下捎钱，赵的家里并藏有暗枪和变天账，另外他又揭露和赵一起活动的地主，都还保存着减租中退地的红契文书，没有交给农民……这些内幕，立刻激起了群众的怒恨，二十三日，全村佃户，都三五成群的去地主家算账。非法地主赵苏文，在群众压力下退出了二百三十张红契，现洋一百五十元，手枪两支，张志贤交出“变天账”三本，把减租减息中退给群众的东西（这是他们过去非法掠夺群众的东西）全记上了，有一本上，还将去年大反攻中支差担彩号的工也记上了，群众对此更加愤恨。当天下午，民主政府。应群众之请，依法将这些非法地主拘起来。二十五日，平罗川六千群众联合向这些非法地主进行清算，上当分子刘汉章、牛贵锁等二十四人，因感于我政府之宽大，乃将特务内幕当场向群众坦白：原来南平罗的特务组织，是在去秋组织起来的，共三十一人，由地主赵景文任大队长，吴祖周为副大队长兼参谋长，张福兴任指挥行动的中队长，下设调查员（苟凌祥）书记（刘汉章）黑枪班、搂枪班以及和伪军汉奸联络的交通等。接着牛贵锁坦白三月袭击村武装部事件，他说：这全是特务头子赵景文计划的，赵并说：晚上四大队（汉奸赵全五）要上盘来帮助，实行里应外合，先打死武委会主任、干部，县府机关………，说到这里，良心的涌现，使牛痛哭起来，他说：特务害了我，灾荒年间，国民党闹得我全家无法过活，使我不得不逃到山西，八路军民主政府来了，光景过好了，有了地，也娶了老婆，可是怕变天就上了当，他咬紧了牙，用拳头痛痛的打了一下赵景文说：就是你这狗害了我！上当分子一个继续着一个，痛哭流涕的坦白着自己所作的一切肮脏事情、咒骂着国民党特务对他们的毒害。天气虽然是那样的热，但六千余位群众，始终充满着对国民党特务害国害民的仇恨、以及对于上当失足份子耐心挽救的热忱。最后，特务头子赵景文向群众承认他想变天，拿回减租减息中合理退给农民的利益，并承认和汉奸赵全五的联系，这时政府根据群众意见，将赵景文拘压起来，依法处理。其余分子，则甄别轻重，分别处理，最后政府号召大家，不要麻痹，百倍警惕起来，结合保卫夏收，再进一步的贯彻查减运动。（白涛）
