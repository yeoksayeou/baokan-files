Mugwort (Artemisia Argyi) Can Treat Malaria
    Li Zhi
    In recent years, military doctor Yoshida discovered that mugwort contains a large amount of quinine (Artemisia Argyi is found everywhere, has a bitter but non-toxic taste, and is an important medicine for acupuncture). It is no less effective than quinine pills. He has used Artemisia Argyi to cure many malaria patients. Usage: Take half a catty of fresh Artemisia Argyi, wash it with lukewarm water, mash it, soak it in a little cold boiled water for about fifteen minutes, squeeze out the juice, and it is effective to take it two or three hours before the onset of malaria. If it tastes bitter and astringent, you can add sugar to adjust the taste. However, pregnant women should not take it.
    Using Artemisia Argyi to treat malaria is the same as using quinine pills. It must be taken two or three hours before the onset of chills to be effective. If taken too early or too late, or during the onset of chills, it will not be effective. After the malaria stops, continue to take it for a week. If it is tertian malaria, take a few more doses (but if you take too much, it will cause tinnitus) to completely kill the malaria parasites. Chinese medicine Changshan and Bupleurum are important medicines for traditional Chinese medicine to treat malaria, especially Changshan. If it is combined with Artemisia Argyi to treat malaria, its effectiveness will be even more significant. Changshan also has the effect of eliminating phlegm. The usual dosage is one to three qian at a time. Bupleurum also has an antipyretic effect, and the usual dose is one to two qian at a time. Artemisia Argyi is an important medicine for moxibustion, and it also has the effect of stopping bleeding and treating dysentery. The ordinary dosage is one to two qian at a time. For treating malaria, it has already been said that half a catty of fresh Artemisia Argyi can be juiced and taken internally. It is also effective to decoct four or five taels of dried Artemisia Argyi. If Artemisia Argyi is boiled into a paste and made into pills or powders, its application will be more convenient.

　　艾叶（苦艾）可治疟疾
    李治
    近几年来军医吉田氏发现艾叶中含有奎宁分量甚多（苦艾到处都有。味苦无毒是针灸要药）。不逊于奎宁丸。用苦艾治愈过许多患疟疾者。用法：采生艾半斤，用微温水洗净，捣碎，浸于少许冷开水内，约十五分钟，绞汁，当疟疾发前二三小时服之有效。如觉味苦涩，可加糖调服。但孕妇忌服。
    用艾叶治疟疾，同奎宁丸是一样的。一定要在发冷前二三小时服下去，才有效力。若服时过早过迟，或发冷时，均无疗效。疟疾停止后，还要连服一周，如是二日疟，更要多服几剂，（但如服过多发生耳鸣。）才能使疟疾原虫完全杀灭。中药常山、柴胡，为国医治疟疾要药，尤以常山为好，若与苦艾配起来治疟疾，其效力更为显著。常山并有祛痰作用。通常一次用量一——三钱。柴胡并有解热作用，通常一次用一——二钱。苦艾为灸病要药，又有止血及治痢疾作用，普通用量一次用一——二钱。治疟疾，用生艾半斤绞汁内服，前面已经说过。还可用干艾四五两煎服亦有效。若用艾熬膏做成丸散，则应用更为便利。
