Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Chiang Kai-shek, abandoning the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and while persisting in and expanding the civil war in the Northeast, has arbitrarily established a "Ministry of National Defense" monopolized by the Kuomintang. According to dispatches from Nanjing by the Central News Agency yesterday and the day before, Chiang Kai-shek convened a meeting of military cadres in Chongqing in April to arrange for the abolition of the Military Affairs Commission and the establishment of a new "Ministry of National Defense," assigning Chen Cheng to preside over the matter. On May 15, Chiang submitted the matter to the Kuomintang's Supreme National Defense Council for "approval," and at the same time proposed that Bai Chongxi be the "Defense" Minister and Chen Cheng the Chief of Staff, which was also "approved." On the 30th, the council also passed the so-called "Organizational Outline of the Ministry of National Defense," which stipulated that the ministry would be placed under the Executive Yuan, but also stipulated that "the Ministry of National Defense shall, upon the order of the Chairman of the National Government, comprehensively manage military orders, and upon the order of the President of the Executive Yuan, comprehensively manage military administration." In addition, it stipulated that "the Ministry of National Defense shall have three vice ministers, three deputy chiefs of staff, and four general headquarters, in charge of the navy, army, air force, and joint logistics, etc. Each department shall have one commander-in-chief, who shall, upon the order of the Chairman of the National Government and the guidance of the Chief of Staff, be in charge of business, and shall have two or three deputy commanders to assist him. There shall also be six departments, in charge of personnel, intelligence, planning operations, supplies, training, and research, etc., each with one director and two deputy directors. There shall be seven bureaus, in charge of news, civil affairs, security, budget, historical materials, supervision, and conscription, etc., each with one director. The departments and bureaus shall, upon the order of the Chief of Staff, be in charge of business." This "Organizational Outline" was promulgated in the name of the National Government on the 31st, and on the same day, Bai Chongxi was announced as Minister of National Defense, Chen Cheng as Chief of Staff, Lin Wei, Qin Dechun, and He Shiyi as Vice Ministers of National Defense, Liu Fei, Guo Chan, and Fan Hanjie as Deputy Chiefs of Staff, Gu Zhutong as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Chen Cheng concurrently as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Zhou Zhirou as Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, and Huang Zhenqiu as Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Rear Services.

According to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, reorganizing the Kuomintang's one-party monopolized Military Affairs Commission into a joint Ministry of National Defense composed of all parties, the principles for building and reorganizing the army stipulated in the Political Consultative Conference's Military Affairs Plan were "the army belongs to the state, and the responsibility of soldiers lies in defending the country and loving the people," and implementing the methods of "separation of army and party," "separation of army and people," and "governing the army with politics." Regarding the issue of the Ministry of National Defense, it was stipulated: (1) When the preliminary army reorganization plan is completed, the Military Affairs Commission shall be reorganized into the Ministry of National Defense, which shall be subordinate to the Executive Yuan; (2) The Minister of National Defense should not be limited to military personnel, … (5) A Military Construction Committee shall be established within the Ministry of National Defense to be responsible for planning and assessment (this committee shall be attended by people from all parties). Now that the army reorganization has not been "preliminarily completed," and without consulting the consent of all parties, nor establishing a Military Construction Committee, it has arbitrarily been reorganized independently. The list of eleven main responsible persons announced is entirely composed of Kuomintang members, and except for He Shiyi, all are Kuomintang Central Committee members. Among them, Bai, Chen, and Gu, like He Yingqin, are all well-known anti-communist civil war experts. This move is obviously to destroy the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and usurp the Ministry of National Defense as the supreme command for maintaining the oligarchy's one-party dictatorship by armed force and conducting a large-scale anti-communist and anti-people civil war.

    蒋介石撕毁政协决议
    擅自成立一党“国防部”
    一批反共内战专家加官进爵
    【新华社延安二日电】蒋介石抛弃政协决议，在坚持与扩大东北内战中，擅自成立了国民党一党包办的“国防部”。综合中央社昨前两日南京电讯称：蒋介石于四月间即在重庆召开军事干部会议，布置撤销军委会，另组“国防部”，指派陈诚主持其事。至五月十五日，蒋提交国民党国防最高委员会“通过”，同时提出以白崇禧为“国防”部长，陈诚为参谋总长，亦经“通过”。三十日，该会又通过所谓“国防部组织纲要”，其中规定该部置于行政院之下，但又规定“国防部承国民政府主席之命，综理军令事宜，并承行政院长之命，综理军政事宜”。此外规定“国防部设次长三人，参谋次长三人，设四总司令部，分掌海、陆空军及联合勤务等事宜，各部各设总司令一人，承国府主席之命、参谋总长之指导，分掌业务，并设副司令二人或三人辅助之，并设六厅，分掌人事、情报、计划作战、补给、编训、研究等事宜，各置厅长一人，副厅长二人，设七局，分掌新闻、民事、保安、预算、史料、督察、兵役等事项，各置局长一人，厅与局均承参谋总长之命，分掌业务”。此项“组织纲要”，已于三十一日用国民政府名义公布，同日并用国民政府名义公布白崇禧为国防部长，陈诚为参谋总长，林蔚、秦德纯、何士毅为国防部次长，刘斐、郭忏、范汉杰为参谋次长，顾祝同为陆军总司令，陈诚兼海军总司令，周至柔为空军总司令，黄镇球为联合后方勤务总司令。
    按把国民党一党包办的军事委员会改组为各党派联合的国防部，原为政协会的决议，政协会军事问题案中，曾规定建军整军原则为“军队属于国家，军人责任在于卫国爱民”，实行“军党分立”、“军民分治”、“以政治军”办法。关于国防部问题，曾规定：（一）在初步整军计划完成时，即改组军事委员会为国防部，隶属行政院；（二）国防部长应不以军人为限，……（五）国防部内设一建军委员会，负责计划及考核之责（此委员由各方人士参加）。现在军队整编既未“初步完成”，并未征求各党派同意，也不设立建军委员会，而擅自单独改组，其所公布之十一个主要负责人选名单，则无一非国民党人士，且除何士毅一人外，均为国民党中委，其中如白、陈、顾等与何应钦一样，都系有名的反共内战专家，此举显为破坏政协决议，将国防部窃篡为以武装保持寡头的一党专政，及进行大规模反共反人民内战的最高指挥部。
