Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 2nd – Since the US-KMT representatives of the Yongnian Group stationed themselves in Yongnian city on the 15th of last month, the puppet troops inside the city have become increasingly rampant. They have been firing at the Eighth Route Army's defense area outside the city for days and have been going out of the city by boat to loot and harass. Nearly sixteen newly built bunkers around the city have now been completed. On the 18th, the puppet side ordered the demolition of civilian houses on eighteen streets, including West Street in the city (accounting for about one-third of the entire city), to rush the construction of an airport, causing thousands of residents in the city to be exposed to the streets, suffering from poverty and disease, and complaining endlessly. The CCP representative of the Executive Headquarters protested to the KMT side and requested to enter the city to visit the airport. The KMT representative refused and sophistically argued, "Building an airport is for the happiness of the majority." Zhao Haifeng, Commander of the local Eighth Route Army, said: "Since the Kuomintang representatives entered the city, the puppet troops have become more rampant, actively preparing to coordinate with the civil war. If this dangerous provocative behavior is not stopped immediately, unfortunate incidents will occur."

[Another dispatch] At 12:00 on the 29th, the Yongnian Group and the Public Welfare Relief Team went to Qianhou Wanjin to inspect the Kuomintang's violation of the agreement to attack. When they arrived at Danian Village, they were suddenly fired upon by two cannons from the Kuomintang army. Subsequently, the attack firepower of the diehard puppet troops became more intense, and the Yongnian Group and the Public Welfare Relief Team were forced to return to Anyang. The next morning, the Anyang Group went to Qianwanjin for inspection. Lieutenant Colonel Kerr, the US representative, discovered slogans on the wall such as "Support Chairman Mao," "Support the Eighth Route Army," and "Demand the Speedy Dissolution of the Puppet Army," which had been blurred by the diehard puppet troops. At the same time, he also found the notices of the Anyang Democratic Government and the list of reasonable burdens that had been torn down by the diehard puppet troops. Lieutenant Colonel Kerr took these back as evidence to prove that the two places were originally liberated areas before May 28th, and that the diehard puppets were indeed attacking illegally.

    国民党代表庇护下
    永年伪军骚扰益厉
    赵海枫司令称：此种挑衅如不制止，将发生不幸事件
    【新华社邯郸二日电】自永年小组国美两方代表于上月十五日进驻永年城后，城内伪军愈益猖狂，连日向城外八路军防地射击，并乘船出城抢掠骚扰，城周新修碉堡近已完成十六座。十八日伪方下令拆毁城内西大街等十八条街民房（约占全城三分之一），赶修机场，致使城内数千居民，露宿街头，贫病交迫，叫苦连天。执行组中共代表向国方提出抗议，并要求进城参观该机场。国方代表竟加拒绝，并诡辩称：“修飞机场是为了谋多数人的幸福”。当地八路军赵海枫司令谈称：“自国民党代表进城后，伪军益加猖狂，积极准备策应内战，此种危险挑衅行为，如不立即制止，将发生不幸事件”。
    【又讯】二十九日十二时永年小组与公益救护队为调查国民党违约进攻前往前后万斤视察，行至大念屯，突遭国民党军射击两炮，随之顽伪军攻击火力益炽，永年小组与公益救护队被迫返安阳。翌晨安阳小组亲赴前万斤视察，美代表柯尔中校发现墙上有“拥护毛主席”，“拥护八路军”，“要求迅速解散伪军”等标语，已被顽伪军撕的模糊不清，同时又发现墙上有被顽伪撕毁的安阳民主政府的布告与合理负担公布清单，柯尔中校将此取回为据，证明该两地五月二十八日前原为解放区，顽伪确系违法攻击。
