    Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhuaidian, 4th: The Administrative Office of the Central Plains Liberated Area is organizing disaster victims to help themselves through production. It is using the remaining 3.5 million yuan to establish the Liji Iron and Wood Factory and the Liji Trading Company to manufacture agricultural tools, selling them at prices 20% lower than the market price, and also issuing small loans. After receiving loans of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, the disaster victims in the surrounding villages immediately engage in transporting goods. If they cannot sell the goods, the Liji Trading Company can purchase them at market prices. At the same time, the Administrative Office is also assigning cadres to go to the countryside to help disaster victims organize production with loans. The Central Plains soldiers are also helping the people reclaim wasteland, plant fields, and weed. A certain unit's training regiment organized a wasteland reclamation team to help disaster victims reclaim more than 50 mu of wasteland.
