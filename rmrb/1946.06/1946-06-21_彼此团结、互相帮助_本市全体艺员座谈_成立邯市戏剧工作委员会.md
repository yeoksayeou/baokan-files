　　Unite with Each Other, Help Each Other
    All Performers in the City Hold a Symposium
    Handan City Drama Work Committee Established
    [This City News] All troupes and entertainers in the city held an expanded get-together symposium on the 18th at the Xinhua Theater. More than 100 people attended, including representatives from the Xinsheng Troupe, Xinhua Troupe, Qunzhong Teahouse, and the Dazhong Art Research Association. Responsible comrades from propaganda and education departments of various organs and organizations also participated. The meeting began in a joyful atmosphere. First, Director Ren of the Propaganda Department of the Military Region Political Department spoke. He said: In the liberated areas, drama workers must first recognize the purpose of performing: to serve the masses. Today, the masses have turned themselves over. Our plays must cheer up and encourage the people. We must improve those old plays that promote feudal superstition. He emphasized: Everyone must unite, break the old view that "competitors are enemies," help each other, and things can be done well. Mr. Lü Ban, the manager of the cinema, gave a more specific explanation based on Director Ren's speech, using many vivid examples. Subsequently, representatives from the Xinsheng Troupe and the Xinhua Troupe spoke, unanimously agreeing that they should unite and help each other to make progress in the future. The Handan City Drama Work Committee was established during the meeting, and Lü Ban, Shi Ruoxu, Yao Geng, Fu Yunqi from the People's Education Center, Pei Dongli from the Literary and Art Work Troupe, Huang Mei and Xia Qing from the Literary Association, Huangfu Shuyu from the Education Department of the Border Government, Hao Changjiang from the Municipal Government, and Director Zhao from the Municipal Administration Office were appointed as members. Lü Ban and Fu Yunqi were elected as the director and deputy director, respectively. From now on, the cultural and entertainment work in this city will have a new look. (Yu)
