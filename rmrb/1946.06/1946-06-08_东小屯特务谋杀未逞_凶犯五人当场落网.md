    Special Agent Assassination Plot Foiled in Dongxiaotun
    Five Criminals Captured on the Spot
    [This City News] A special agent assassination occurred recently in Dongxiaotun, a suburb of this city. Zheng Guaishi, a special agent from Liulin Bridge, colluded with seven accomplices in an attempt to assassinate Li Qingshan, the director of the local farmers' association. Zheng had previously coerced Deng Xiu, the local militia captain, to lead the way and secretly planned to use the militia's weapons. Deng reluctantly agreed at first, but when Zheng led the thugs to Li Qingshan's house, he escaped. Li was immediately tied up by the thugs, but was discovered by the villagers' militia, who immediately fired their guns. A company from the Guards Division also rushed to the scene, capturing five of the seven perpetrators, including the ringleader, Zheng Guaishi. Li Qingshan was rescued on the spot. Zheng and the others have been detained by the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.
