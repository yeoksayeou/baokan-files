    General Ye Jianying's Statement on the "July 7th Incident" in Beiping
    The Kuomintang Authorities' Brutal Suppression of Public Opinion is Part of a Conspiracy to Expand the Civil War
    Hopes to Mobilize the Great Strength of the News Front to Save China's Serious Democratic Crisis
    Vow to Fight for Freedom of Speech and Publication, Resumption of Publication of *Liberation Daily* and Xinhua News Agency
    If the Government Persists in its Errors, it Should be Fully Responsible for the Consequences

    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st] Beiping, 31st dispatch: This afternoon at 4 p.m., General Ye Jianying, the Communist Party member of the Military Mediation Executive Department, hosted a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists regarding the destruction of the *Liberation Daily*, the organ of the CCP in Beiping, the Beiping branch of the Xinhua News Agency, and 75 newspapers, news agencies, and magazines in Beiping by the Kuomintang authorities. More than 50 reporters and magazine representatives from the *New York Times*, the United States Information Service, and newspapers and news agencies in Beiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, and Chongqing attended. First, Qian Junrui, the editor of *Liberation Daily* and the director of the Beiping branch of Xinhua News Agency, reported on the illegal closure of the newspaper and news agency by the authorities, strongly protesting the fascist atrocities of the Kuomintang authorities and calling on colleagues for assistance. General Ye Jianying delivered a speech, stating: "Chinese and foreign journalists, in Chinese history, a well-known second July 7th Incident has occurred in Beiping. That is to say, the reactionary authorities of Beiping City, completely violating the law, closed or forced the suspension of 77 newspapers, magazines, and news agencies in one fell swoop on the dark night of May 29th, forcing 77 organs of public opinion to cease communicating with readers. This includes newspapers and periodicals of women, children, linguistics, science, religion, economics, and commerce. This is an unprecedented great reaction in Chinese history and the world." General Ye Jianying pointed out: The Kuomintang authorities' brutality this time is the second "July 7th Incident." He said: "Our China's first 'July 7th Incident' occurred on July 7th, 1937. The Lugouqiao Incident was a crisis for the Chinese nation, and millions of people suffered unprecedented disasters in the war. This time's 'July 7th Incident' indicates that China's democratic crisis is very serious, and it also shows that the Chinese reactionaries are attempting to maintain their dictatorial ambitions. I must ask Chinese and foreign journalists to pay attention to this serious event with a high degree of vigilance, to report this truth with absolute clarity, and to mobilize national and global public opinion to stop the Kuomintang's reactionary measures and save China's democracy, which is in crisis." He then solemnly pointed out: "The *Liberation Daily*, the organ of the Chinese Communist Party in Beiping, and its news agency, Xinhua News Agency, have suffered the greatest persecution in this reactionary 'July 7th Incident.' They have not only been ordered to cease publication, but have also been illegally sealed up by the authorities. This incident clearly shows the Kuomintang authorities' hatred and discrimination against the CCP, completely violating the Four Pledges and seriously threatening the situation of unity and cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Therefore, I ask Chinese and foreign journalists, for the sake of maintaining China's unity and nation-building, to use fair and serious criticism to condemn the Beiping reactionary authorities' behavior of undermining unity." General Ye Jianying pointed out: This brutal act of the Kuomintang authorities in suppressing public opinion is part of a conspiracy by reactionaries within the Kuomintang to expand the civil war. He said: "The *Liberation Daily*, the organ of the CCP in Beiping, and its news agency, Xinhua News Agency, have consistently strived to oppose the civil war and call for peace, and have often ruthlessly exposed the civil war conspiracies of warmongers. Therefore, reactionary warmongers regard them as thorns in their sides, and constantly suppress and sabotage our *Liberation Daily* and Xinhua News Agency. Today, when they insist on continuing to expand the civil war in the Northeast and create a large-scale nationwide civil war, they openly forced our *Liberation Daily* and Xinhua News Agency to cease publication, and even sealed them up. This is a serious blow to the national peace cause. Therefore, journalists, please use the great strength of your news front to fight unyieldingly for the cause of peace in China and the world."

    Finally, General Jianying answered a question raised by a reporter before the reception: "The government authorities' sealing up of *Liberation Daily* and Xinhua News Agency is illegal and has no legal basis. This action violates the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the Four Pledges, and the principles of freedom of speech in democratic countries. We will never recognize the government's illegal sealing up of legitimate organs of public opinion, whether they belong to the CCP or other parties or private newspapers and news agencies, as a legal action. As for the temporary suspension of our newspaper and news agency, it is because the Kuomintang authorities sealed up the newspaper and news agency at 8 p.m. on the 29th, and also sealed up the printing factory that printed *Liberation Daily*, depriving us of all possibilities of work. In order to strive for freedom of speech and publication, we will continue to struggle and will not stop until freedom of speech and publication and the resumption of publication of *Liberation Daily* and Xinhua News Agency are achieved! We have given the government authorities the opportunity to correct their mistakes and resolve this matter. If the government continues to make mistakes, it should be fully responsible for the consequences."

    关于北平“七七事件”
    叶剑英将军发表谈话
    国民党当局摧残舆论暴行乃扩大内战阴谋的一部分
    希望动员新闻战线伟大力量挽救中国民主严重危机
    誓争言论出版自由解放报新华社复刊
    如果政府坚持错误对其后果应负全责
    【新华社延安一日电】北平三十一日电：今日下午四时，军事调处执行部中共委员叶剑英将军，为中共在平机关报解放报、及本社北平分社、与平市七十五家报社通讯社杂志社，同时遭受国民党当局摧残事，招待中外记者，到纽约时报、美国新闻处、及平、津、沪、汉、渝各报及通讯社记者与杂志界五十余人，首由解放报及本社北平分社社长钱俊瑞，报告该报该社横遭当局非法封闭经过，严重抗议国民党当局之法西斯暴行，呼吁同业予以援助。叶剑英将军发表谈话称：“中外记者们，在中国历史上，在北平产生了众所周知的第二个七七事件，这就是说北平市的反动当局，完全犯法的在五月廿九日的黑夜里，一下子封闭了或迫停了七十七家报纸杂志通讯社，迫使七十七家言论机关，不能继续与读者见面。这里面包括妇女、儿童、语言学、科学、宗教、经济、商业性质的报刊，这是中国历史上也是世界上空前的大反动”。叶剑英将军指出：国民党当局这次的暴行，是第二次“七七事件”，他说：“我们中国第一次‘七七事件’发生在一九三七年七七，芦沟桥事变是中国民族的危机，千百万人民曾在战争中遭到空前的灾难，而这一次的‘七七事件’是表示出中国民主的危机十分严重，同时也表示出中国反动派企图维持他们的独裁的野心。必须请中外记者先生们，要以高度的警惕性，来重视这一严重的事件，要以十分明确的真实性，来报导这一真相，动员起全国和全世界的舆论，来制止国民党这一反动措施，挽救陷入危机中的中国民主。”他继即严正指出：“中国共产党在北平的机关报——解放报，及其通讯社——新华社，在这一次反动的‘七七事件’中，遭受到最大的迫害，他们不仅被勒令停刊，而且被当局违法的查封了。这一事件，明显的表示出国民党当局对中共的仇视与歧视，根本违背了四项诺言，严重的威胁了国共团结合作的局面，因此请中外记者先生们，为了维护中国的团结建国起见，必须以公正和严肃的批评，来指责北平反动当局破坏团结的行为。叶剑英将军指出：此次国民党当局摧残舆论之暴行，是国民党内反动派扩大内战的阴谋的一部分。他说：“中共在北平的机关报——解放报，及其通讯社——新华社，一贯的为反对内战呼吁和平而努力，对好战份子的内战阴谋，经常给以无情的揭破，因此反动的好战份子视之为眼中钉，不断的给我们解放报及新华社以压制和破坏，今天当着他们坚持在东北继续扩大内战，全国造成全国规模的大内战的时候，他们公然强迫我们解放报、新华社停刊，以至查封，这是对全国和平事业严重的打击。因此，记者先生们，请用你们新闻战线的伟大力量，为中国和世界的和平事业作不屈不挠的斗争”。
    最后剑英将军答复某记者在招待会前提出之问题称：“政府当局的查封解放报新华社，是非法的，没有任何法律根据，这种行动，破坏了政协决议、四项诺言、以及民主国家言论自由的原则，对于政府非法查封合法的言论机关，不论其为中共或其他党派或私人报纸通讯社，我们都永远不能承认其为合法行动。至于我们报纸通讯社暂时休刊，乃是因为国民党当局已于二十九日下午八时将该报该社查封，并将承印解放报的印刷厂也查封了，剥夺了一切工作的可能，我们为了争取言论出版自由，将继续奋斗下去，不达到言论出版自由和解放报新华社的复刊誓不休止！我们已给了政府当局改正错误、解决此事的机会，如果政府一错再错，其后果应完全由政府负责。
