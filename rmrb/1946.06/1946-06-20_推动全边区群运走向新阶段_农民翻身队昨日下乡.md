    Promoting a New Stage in Mass Movements Throughout the Border Region
    Peasant Emancipation Teams Headed to the Countryside Yesterday
    The Central Bureau and other agencies held a grand farewell ceremony. The entire team is committed to dedicating themselves to this glorious historical mission with a new spirit and great enthusiasm.
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau's Peasant Emancipation Team departed yesterday for the Third Sub-district of Southern Hebei to participate in and lead the peasant emancipation movement. The two hundred-plus comrades heading to the countryside felt extremely excited and happy about being able to personally participate in this great movement, deeply aware that to "serve the masses," they must boldly, resolutely, quickly, and thoroughly mobilize the vast people, who constitute over ninety percent of the total population, economically, politically, and ideologically. Everyone firmly remembered Chairman Yang of the Border Region Government saying, "Mobilizing the masses is the foundation of all work," recognizing that only with the full mobilization of the masses can peace, democracy, and construction be guaranteed. Therefore, they all have the greatest confidence and determination in this sacred cause. The day before yesterday, the Border Region Government and the Mass Movement Department of the Central Bureau and other agencies held a farewell ceremony for the team in the assembly hall of the Council. Comrade Wang Congwu earnestly encouraged everyone: "After going to the countryside, you must obey the leadership of the local leading organs, humbly learn from the masses, strengthen unity with local cadres, and fully implement the Party's policies among the masses." He said: "After the masses are fully mobilized, the Party will welcome comrades back victoriously with boundless enthusiasm." The Central Bureau, Military Region Headquarters, Border Region Government, and other agencies have invested great effort and determination in this peasant emancipation movement, specially selecting over two hundred capable cadres from Party, government, military, and civilian agencies to form emancipation teams, preparing to use a new spirit to first make breakthroughs in Linzhang and Handan, creating experience for further boldness and full mobilization of the masses. Before departure, they underwent half a month of intensive study. Chairman Yang Xiufeng and Vice Chairman Rong Wusheng of the Border Region Government, Commander Liu Bocheng and Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping, and Deputy Political Commissar Bo Yibo of the Military Region, and other responsible comrades all personally gave speeches, explained policies, and offered ideas, fully equipping everyone. Commander Liu proposed to everyone: Now we must strive for peace, democracy, and unity, and oppose civil war, dictatorship, and division. We must thoroughly implement the land policy. He called on everyone to "thoroughly implement the land policy of rent reduction and interest reduction with enthusiasm and honesty." He powerfully called on the people's army to help the people emancipate themselves. Chairman Yang pointed out in his speech that the spirit of the policy is to first take care of the legitimate demands of the masses and support the peasant emancipation movement. He said: The class relations in the new areas are complex. We must satisfy the demands of the peasants. In addition to rent reduction and debt clearing, we should conduct reasonable settlement of feudal landlords and local tyrants' shifting burdens, concealing land, embezzling public funds, and deducting wages and other extra exploitation. Political Commissar Deng and Deputy Political Commissar Bo particularly emphasized boldly releasing hands, opposing any constraints, trusting and cherishing the enthusiasm of the masses, and respecting and promoting the creativity of the masses. We are a part of the masses, the servants of the masses, and we must wholeheartedly help the masses emancipate themselves. They said: Whoever participates in this historical event, which deserves to be written in large characters in the modern history of the Chinese nation, will forever be remembered in their own life history. During the half-month study process, each comrade conducted ideological reflection and ideological examination based on the spirit of the leaders' reports, unanimously recognizing that this mass movement is a major plan for China to embark on a new democratic society, and should wholeheartedly participate in the movement to help the masses emancipate themselves and train themselves into strong revolutionary fighters. The comrades of the Central Bureau's hostel participated in mass work in the驻地 during the study process. The Central Bureau's Party School, in conjunction with local cadres, conducted policy studies, further understanding the suffering of the peasants, and determined to spare no effort to strive for the thorough emancipation of the peasants. The Border Region Government's court study group, combined with reflection on past participation in mass work, made a learning appraisal for each person, considering it the goal of future efforts. In addition to transferring more than half of its cadres to participate in the mass movement, the Border Region Government stipulated that one of the director and deputy director of each department should regularly go to the countryside to inspect the mass movement work. In addition to transferring cadres to participate in the team, the Border Region Health Bureau also formed two medical teams to accompany them, ensuring the successful completion of this major task. According to relevant sources, with such enthusiastic sponsorship and support from all aspects, this mass movement will definitely achieve the expected results. (Bing Ru)
