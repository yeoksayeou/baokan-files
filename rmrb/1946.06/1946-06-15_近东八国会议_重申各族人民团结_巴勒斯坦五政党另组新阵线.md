Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Damascus dispatch: Thirty representatives from seven Arab nations and Palestine held a second meeting on the 8th in Brudan, near Damascus (the first meeting was held in Cairo a few days ago, without the participation of Palestinian representatives), to discuss the Anglo-American Commission of Inquiry's plan to move 100,000 Jews into Palestine. They reaffirmed their united opposition to the Anglo-American Commission's plan (which is primarily the American proposal). Amin, Secretary-General of the Arab League, said: He believes that with the support of the Arab League in Palestine, victory will be achieved. During the meeting, the Arab countries reaffirmed their support for Egypt's demand for the withdrawal of British troops.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Jerusalem dispatch: Five Palestinian parties have formed a new front to oppose the Arab Higher Committee. The names of these parties are the National Defense Party, the Reform Party, the National Bloc, the Arab Youth Congress, and the Independence Party. The above five parties had already agreed to join the Arab Higher Committee to complete the political unification of Palestinian Arabs. However, Hussein's pro-British activities as chairman of the Arab Higher Committee, and his attempt to control this political party alliance, led to its breakup. It is said that Hussein opposed submitting the Palestine issue to the Security Council, and at the same time, he demanded that the Palestinian Arab Party he leads should become the majority party in the committee, and insisted that the candidates designated by the above five parties to participate in the Higher Committee must be approved by him. He strongly advocated excluding all leftists from the proposed candidates. After breaking with Hussein, the five parties have established an "Arab Higher Front," one of whose programs is to submit the Palestine issue to the Security Council.

    近东八国会议
    重申各族人民团结
    巴勒斯坦五政党另组新阵线
    【新华社延安十二日电】大马士革讯：阿拉伯七国与巴勒斯坦的代表三十人，八日在大马士革附近的布鲁丹，举行第二次会议（第一次会议，系于日前在开罗举行，巴勒斯坦代表未参加），讨论英美调查委员会迁移十万犹太人入巴勒斯坦的计划。他们重申团结一致，反抗英美委员会的计划（该计划主要为美国的方案）。阿拉伯联盟总书记阿米姆说：相信在巴勒斯坦阿拉伯联盟的支持下，将获得胜利。会议中，各阿拉伯国家重申支持埃及要求英军撤退。
    【新华社延安十二日电】耶路撒冷讯：巴勒斯坦五个政党另组一新阵线，与阿拉伯高级委员会对抗。这些政党的名称为国防党、改良党、国民集团、阿拉伯青年大会及独立党。上述五党本已同意参加阿拉伯高级委员会，以完成巴勒斯坦阿拉伯的政治统一。但由于阿拉伯高级委员会主席胡塞尼的亲英活动，及控制此一政党联盟的企图，遂招致破裂。据称：胡塞尼反对把巴勒斯坦问题提交安理会，同时他要求他所领导的巴勒斯坦阿拉伯党，在委员会中应成为多数党，并坚决要上述五党指定参加高级委员会的人选，必须经他同意。他强烈主张所提人选中，所有左派人士除外。五党在与胡塞尼决裂后，已成立一“阿拉伯高级阵线”，其纲领之一，为把巴勒斯坦问题提交安理会。
