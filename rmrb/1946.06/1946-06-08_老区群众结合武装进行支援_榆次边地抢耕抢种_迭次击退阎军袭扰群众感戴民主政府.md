    Old Liberated Area Masses Combine with Armed Forces to Provide Support
    Yuci Border Area Seizes Time for Plowing and Planting
    Repeatedly Repelling Yan's Army Raids, Masses are Grateful to the Democratic Government
    [This newspaper Changzhi dispatch] The masses in the old liberated area of Yuci are now combining with local armed forces to fully support the spring plowing and sowing in villages in the border areas. Since the beginning of spring, Yan's army in Yuci has been constantly raiding our border areas, robbing grain, and seizing men. Local people have been unable to carry out production. In mid-May, villages such as Shuangcun, Xiaojianan, and Zhaocun were robbed by Yan's army for three consecutive days. The masses lost more than 20 head of livestock and more than 20 pieces of farm tools, and 28 young men and 6 women were kidnapped. They were also forced to hand over 20 piculs of wheat and 600,000 yuan in legal tender per person. Moreover, in villages such as Dongxi Jianzi, Beitou, and Baoansai, 30 head of livestock were robbed in one instance, and 29 young adults were taken away, making it extremely difficult for the masses in various villages to carry out spring plowing and sowing. In order to enable the local people to sow in a timely manner, our Yuci Democratic Government established a Labor-Military Integration Committee a few days ago, and transferred a part of the county's livestock to the border villages under the cover of local armed forces and militia to carry out rush plowing and sowing. In the third and fourth districts of the county alone, 318 head of livestock were sent to support the border villages. At a rate of 20 hectares ploughed per day, 82 hectares of wasteland were planted in a blitz. More than 10 villages, including Shangnan Beiliu, organized 428 head of supporting livestock to help plant more than 1,000 mu of grain. During the rush planting, Yan's army raided several times, but was repelled by our local armed forces and militia. Villages near Shinaogang Ten Li in the county were also unable to plant quickly due to constant raids by Yan's army. At the end of last month, our army specially went to cover them. After four nights of blitz, all 4,120 mu of grain land were planted. The local people were all indignantly saying: "Yan Xishan wants our lives, the democratic government saves our lives."

    老区群众结合武装进行支援
    榆次边地抢耕抢种
    迭次击退阎军袭扰群众感戴民主政府
    【本报长治讯】榆次老区群众现正结合地方武装全力支援边沿区各村春耕下种。入春以来，榆次阎军对我边沿区的袭扰抢粮抓丁，无日间断。当地群众已无法进行生产。上月中旬双村、小伽南、赵村等村连遭阎军三天抢劫，群众损失牲口二十头，农具二十余件，绑走壮丁二十八人，妇女六人。并迫令每人交麦子二十石、法币六十万元。又东西见子、北头、保安塞等四村，一次即被抢去牲口三十头，抓走青壮年二十九人，致各村群众春耕下种，极感困难。我榆次民主政府为使当地人民适时下种，特于日前成立劳武结合委员会，抽调全县畜力一部，在地方武装及民兵掩护下，开往边沿区各村，进行抢耕抢种。仅该县三、四两区支援边沿村的牲口即达三百一十八犋。以每天耕种二十顷的速度，将八十二顷荒地突击种完。上南北流等十余村，组织起支援牲口四一百二十八犋，帮助种谷千多亩。抢种中阎军曾数度出扰，均被我地方武装与民兵击退。该县狮脑岗十里附近的村庄，亦因阎军不断袭扰，不能迅速下种，上月底我军特开往掩护，经四夜突击，即将四千一百二十亩谷地，全部种完，当地群众，莫不感愤的说：“阎锡山要命，民主政府救命”。
