    [This paper Yangcheng 16th telegram] Nationalist army and Yan Xishan army invaded the south of the Fen River Liberation Area, launching fierce offensives and repeated "mopping up" operations for nearly four weeks. Now they have been counterattacked by the local military and civilians. On the 10th of this month, two companies of the 72nd Division of Yan's army, which occupied Jikwang Mountain, the heartland of the south of Fen River Liberation Area, were completely annihilated by our army that night. The invaded villages in Jikwang Mountain were immediately recovered by us. The 72nd Division of Yan's army, which is now gathered in Wangfan, Sijiazhuang, and Shipaizhuang, about 30 miles north of Anyi, was transferred back to Wanquan Jingcun area in the south of Fen River Liberation Area on the 12th, attempting to invade again.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yangcheng, 15th] In early June, Yan's army along the Tongpu line, in order to cooperate with the offensive in southern Shanxi, continuously invaded the liberation area along the line 41 times, all of which were repelled by our army. On the 5th, two battalions of the 218th Regiment of the 73rd Division of Yan's army in Lingshi, with more than 1,000 local armed forces, invaded Jingsheng Town and Mahe Village in our Lingshi Liberation Area and continued to窜犯 (illegible in original) into our hinterland. Our army was forced to defend itself and recovered Mahe. The entire 2nd Battalion of the 218th Regiment of Yan's army was annihilated, and 210 people, including the battalion commander, were captured alive. On the 4th, more than 500 soldiers of the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the 44th Division of Yan's army in Jiexiu invaded Baohe and continued to invade. Our army fought back heroically and wiped out most of the invading army.
    [This paper, Heze, 16th] The Jilu Yu army has recently repelled the attacks of the Kuomintang army and puppet army from Anyang, Shangqiu, Peixian and other places, and achieved significant victories. On May 24th, more than 400 soldiers from the 2nd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the puppet army Cheng Daosheng's force stationed in Taibao, Anyang, invaded Mengzhuang, Chenzhuang, Dongzhuang and other places in the eastern Anyang Liberation Area. On the 25th, they occupied Shizhuang, and on the morning of the 26th, they further occupied Chuwang, Daxiao Nangang, Dishang and other villages. Wherever Cheng's force went, they forced the people to repair bunkers and build villages, and assigned 3,000 to 10,000 catties of grain to each village. They also arrested 86 of our village cadres and militiamen in Chuwang, Nangang and other villages. The military and civilians of Anyang could no longer bear it, so they rose up to defend themselves and surrounded Chenzhuang, Dongzhuang, and Mengzhuang on May 28th. After fighting until the next day, the 2nd Battalion of Cheng Ni's 2nd Regiment and a part of the puppet Neihuang Brigade were all annihilated. At dawn on the 29th, the 13th Battalion of the 6th Regiment of Taibao and the entire 5th Regiment came to support in two routes, and were also defeated by us in Dongzhuang and other places. More than 100 puppet soldiers were killed or wounded in the above battles, and more than 220 puppet battalion commanders and others were captured, and 10 light machine guns, 1 28 mortars, and more than 140 rifles were seized. In Shangqiu and Peixian, on the 10th of this month, the Kuomintang Henan Security Brigade Sun Xingqi's force and one battalion of the 55th Army, totaling more than 1,000 people, looted food in the Wutiquan area north of Shangqiu city. Our army resolutely counterattacked and repelled them, killing or wounding more than 250 of the invading army. On the 11th, more than 1,000 soldiers from the Kuomintang Peixian Security Regiment Zhang Kaiyue and Wu Pinshan's force also looted food in the Dazhangzhai area, and were severely attacked by our defending army, and pursued to the Dulou and Dingwan areas. When our army returned victoriously, the masses along the line warmly comforted them.
