The people of China and the United States have a traditional friendship. When President Roosevelt led the United States to join hands with China in the fight against Japan, the American army received close cooperation from the broad masses of the Chinese people, including those in the liberated areas. The American people and democratic figures in the American government were good friends of the Chinese democratic movement. Precisely because of this, the Hurley policy, which undermined Sino-American friendship and hindered China's post-war peace and democracy, was opposed not only by the Chinese people but also by various democratic figures in the United States. The statement on China policy issued by U.S. President Truman on December 15th last year ended the Hurley policy. It called for consultations between the National Government and the Chinese Communist Party and other armed forces with differing opinions in China to cease hostilities. It demanded that representatives of China's major parties hold a national conference to end the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship, reorganize the National Government so that all Chinese parties could enjoy fair and effective representation, and declared that American support for the National Government would not extend to using American military intervention to influence any process of internal strife in China. The joint communiqué on China issued by the Three Foreign Ministers Conference in Moscow last December, in which the United States participated, called for China to stop the civil war and achieve unity and democracy, and demanded the extensive absorption of all democratic elements into all institutions of the National Government. It declared that the three governments would not interfere in China's internal affairs and promised that the American military, like the Soviet military, would withdraw from China within the shortest possible time. The Chinese people warmly welcomed the above-mentioned wise policies. Therefore, when U.S. Special Envoy General Marshall came to China last December and, based on the above-mentioned policies, promoted the cessation of hostilities in China and the convening of the Political Consultative Conference, his work also gained the trust and enthusiastic cooperation of the Chinese people.

However, the reactionary forces in China opposed the principles of the Moscow Conference's communiqué on China, the principles of Truman's statement demanding peace, democracy and guaranteeing no military intervention in China, and General Marshall's efforts to stop the Chinese civil war. The military authorities of the Chinese Kuomintang violated the national ceasefire order of January 10th and the Northeast ceasefire order of March 27th from the very first day they were issued. They continued their offensive actions in many parts of the country, especially in the Northeast, continued to mobilize troops throughout the country, refused to dismantle and continued to build bunkers and other fortifications blocking transportation, and refused to disband and reorganize all puppet troops and many bandits. Kuomintang secret service agencies, the Kuomintang army, and puppet troops disrupted the Peiping Executive Headquarters, assassinated CCP personnel in the Peiping Executive Headquarters, detained CCP personnel in the Shijiazhuang and Shenyang Executive Groups, beat CCP representatives in the Botou and Zaozhuang Executive Groups, and took other despicable measures to make it impossible for the Executive Headquarters to actually carry out its ceasefire mission. None of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference were implemented. The fascist reign of terror under one-party dictatorship was even more rampant and barbaric than before the Political Consultative Conference. According to the constraints of the Three Foreign Ministers' Moscow Conference, the United States should stop and withdraw any assistance to the National Government's civil war and dictatorial policies, especially military assistance. Only in this way can people believe that the United States sincerely hopes that China will achieve peace, democracy, and unity, and sincerely fulfill its promise not to influence any process of internal strife in China through military intervention. Only in this way will General Marshall's efforts to stop the Chinese civil war not become a futile decoration.

However, the facts are completely the opposite. As China's civil war and reign of terror become more serious day by day, the reactionary forces in the U.S. government have continued to strengthen their assistance to the Kuomintang government supported by the Chinese reactionaries in direct proportion, especially continuing to provide fierce assistance in military transportation and arms supply. In the ceasefire agreement in early January, National Government representative Zhang Qun stated to CCP representative Zhou Enlai and U.S. representative Marshall that the Kuomintang troops transported to the Northeast would be limited to a small number. Later, the troop reduction plan signed in late February specifically stipulated that the Kuomintang's first phase of garrison troops in the Northeast would be limited to five armies. In the Northeast ceasefire agreement in late March, Kuomintang representative Zhang Zhizhong and U.S. representative Qi Lan unanimously stated that the Kuomintang army transported to the Northeast would not and would not be allowed to exceed five armies. However, in mid-April, after the Kuomintang's five armies had been transported to the Northeast by the U.S. Navy and an unprecedentedly fierce civil war had broken out in the Northeast, the U.S. Navy, disregarding the Chinese Communist Party's repeated protests, continued to transport the 60th and 93rd armies from South China to the Northeast. In late April, General Marshall returned to China, and he guaranteed that the United States would no longer transport more troops for the Kuomintang. However, by late May, the civil war in the Northeast was even more brutal, and the civil war in North China was even more serious. The U.S. Navy decided to transport the Kuomintang's 53rd and 54th armies to the Northeast or North China, and the northward transport of other Kuomintang armies from South China and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River was still being prepared. It is clear that the civil war in North China and the Northeast could only have occurred and intensified after the United States transported troops and ammunition in place of the Kuomintang. Without American military transportation, it would have been impossible for the Chinese reactionaries to wage a large-scale civil war in the Northeast and North China.

Since the Japanese surrender (that is, during the civil war rather than during the War of Resistance), the United States' huge navy and land and air forces have been stationed in various parts of China, repeatedly declaring their intention to withdraw, but repeatedly postponing it. Now even the families of American soldiers have been transported to China, indicating that the American military has regarded China as their base. They not only help initiate and transport troops for the civil war in China, but also help them guard and repair ports, railways, and mines, train them to fight and use American-supplied bombers, warships, tanks, artillery, and other killing weapons, and even conduct espionage work. After the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the beginning of the civil war in China, the United States equipped the initiators of the civil war with forty American-equipped divisions (while only equipping twenty divisions during the War of Resistance, and the vast majority of these twenty divisions were also used for the civil war and not for the War of Resistance), organized a navy and air force, and supplied them with a large number of aircraft, ships, rocket launchers, artillery, tanks, gasoline, and all other war materials, including daily necessities for officers and soldiers. It is clear that without the assistance of these American arms, the Chinese reactionaries would not be able to wage a large-scale civil war.

Under the above circumstances, the Chinese people cannot help but suspect whether today's reality is that Chiang Kai-shek's fierce civil war policy demands fierce American military intervention, or whether fierce American military intervention demands Chiang Kai-shek's fierce civil war policy? The Chinese people cannot help but note that American military intervention is not without imperialist goals. Perhaps one day, the United States will demand military bases and political and economic rights from China, making China virtually a protectorate and colony of the United States. Chiang Kai-shek's willingness to sacrifice the interests of the country and the nation and the lives and property of the people in exchange for foreign military intervention to consolidate his dictatorial position is an act of treason and national betrayal. In any case, the military intervention of the reactionary forces in the U.S. government is endangering China's national security, endangering China's peace and democracy, and endangering Sino-American friendship and world peace. This policy is clearly inconsistent with the constraints of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, clearly inconsistent with Truman's declaration not to influence any process of internal strife in China through military intervention, and with Marshall's efforts to stop the Chinese civil war, and inconsistent with the wishes of the American people and peace-loving and democratic figures in the U.S. government. Therefore, this erroneous policy of the United States is being criticized and condemned from all sides both in the United States and in China.

As early as February, General Marshall admitted that a small number of stubborn elements in China were selfish and disregarded the desire of the majority of the Chinese people for a life of peace and prosperity. In May, he reiterated that the warmongers in China would plunge China back into the flames of all-out war and cause the Chinese people to suffer unbearable disasters. Now, the Chinese reactionary forces, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, are launching offensives everywhere in Liaoning, Liaobei, Jilin, Rehe, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, eastern Henan, southern Henan, Hubei, eastern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu, causing the civil war to redevelop into a nationwide scale. The reactionary forces have announced that they will implement fascist police district systems and special household registration systems in Shanghai and Peiping, and will implement enemy-puppet national identity card systems and checkpoint systems, implement the so-called "Emergency Measures for Maintaining Public Security in Extraordinary Times" (i.e., a revival of the "Emergency Measures for Maintaining Public Security" during the civil war in 1936); they have sealed up seventy-seven newspapers and periodicals in Peiping; they have arbitrarily confiscated and banned books and newspapers in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang and other places; they have implemented barbaric policies of slaughter and arrest in Xi'an, Nantong and other places, and hundreds and thousands of teachers, students, journalists, workers, women, and democratic figures have been arrested and killed. Tens of thousands of political prisoners across the country have not only not been released, but many have been secretly massacred; in western Sichuan and eastern Xikang, 200,000 peasants have been massacred; and in the southern provinces of China, tens of millions of people have starved to death under corrupt and tyrannical rule. In Hunan province alone, 3.2 million people have starved to death. Who are the Chinese reactionary forces relying on for support and assistance to dare and be able to inflict this unbearable disaster on the Chinese people? No one can deny that the Chinese reactionary forces are solely relying on the support and assistance of the military intervention policy of the reactionary elements in the United States; otherwise, China would have already achieved peace and democracy. The Chinese people are still being slaughtered by foreign weapons after the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan - these are American weapons. The Chinese people's disasters today are fundamentally bestowed by the policy of the reactionary elements in the United States to create and fuel the Chinese civil war. American military intervention has turned many solemn words in Truman's statement into untrustworthy ones, and has made people suspicious of America's role as a mediator in the Chinese civil war. For their own survival, for China's peace and democracy, for Sino-American friendship, international credibility, and international security, the Chinese people cannot but demand that the U.S. government immediately stop this unjust and inhumane criminal policy that violates the constraints of the Moscow Three-Power Conference, immediately stop helping Chiang Kai-shek transport troops, stop supplying Chiang Kai-shek with weapons, materials, and any other assistance, and immediately withdraw all American troops stationed in China and recover all the military supplies and materials that have been given to Chiang Kai-shek. The Chinese people believe that Sino-American friendship cannot be destroyed, and the Chinese people believe that the American people, who love peace, democracy, justice, and humanity, will be able to unite with the Chinese people and rise up to correct the American policy of military intervention that fuels civil war and terror in China.

    美国应即停止助长中国内战
    解放日报六月五日社论
    中美两国人民是有传统的友谊的，在罗斯福总统领导美国与中国携手对日作战的时候，美国军队曾经受到中国广大的人民包括解放区人民的亲密合作，美国的人民与美国政府中的民主人士，是中国民主运动的良友。正因为如此，破坏中美友谊、妨害中国战后和平民主的赫尔利政策，曾经不但受到中国人民、而且受到美国各方民主人士的反对。美国总统杜鲁门在去年十二月十五日所发表的对华政策声明，结束了赫尔利政策，它要求国民政府与中国共产党及中国其他意见不同的武装部队之间，协商停止敌对行动，要求中国各主要党派的代表，举行全国会议，结束国民党的一党专政，改组国民政府，使中国各党派享有公平有效的代表权，并声明美国对国民政府的支持，将不扩展至以美国军事干涉，去影响中国任何内争的过程。美国所参加的去年十二月莫斯科三国外长会议，关于中国问题所发表的公报中，要求中国停止内战，达到团结与民主，要求广泛吸收一切民主分子到国民政府的一切机构中，申明三国政府都不干涉中国内政，并约许美军将与苏军同样在最短期内撤离中国。中国人民热烈欢迎上述的贤明方针，因此当去年十二月来华的美国特使马歇尔将军，根据上述方针促成中国的停战与政治协商会议的召集等，他的工作也获得中国人民的信任与热忱合作。
    但是，中国的反动派，对莫斯科会议关于中国公报的原则，对杜鲁门声明中要求中国和平民主与保证不实行军事干涉的原则，对马歇尔将军停止中国内战的努力，是反对的，中国国民党军事当局从一月十日全国停战命令、和三月二十七日东北停战命令颁布的第一天起，就加以破坏，在全国许多地方，尤其是在东北，继续着他们的进攻行动，在全国各地继续调动军队，拒绝拆毁并继续修筑碉堡和其他封锁交通的工事，拒绝解散并改编全部伪军以及许多土匪，国民党特务机关、国民党军、和伪军，捣乱北平执行部，暗杀北平执行部中共人员，拘捕石家庄和沈阳执行组中共人员，殴伤泊头和枣庄执行组中共代表，并采取其他各种可耻的方法，使执行部实际不能执行停战的任务，政治协商会议的决议任何一项，也没有实行，一党专政的法西斯恐怖统治，反而比政治协商会议以前更为猖獗和野蛮了。按照三国外长莫斯科会议的约束，美国应当停止并收回对于国民党政府内战与独裁政策的任何援助，尤其是军事援助，只有这样，人们才能相信美国是真心希望中国得到和平民主和团结，真心实践不以军事干涉影响中国内争的诺言，也只有这样，马歇尔将军关于停止中国内战的努力，才不致成为一种徒然的装饰。
    但是，事实却完全相反。当中国的内战和恐怖统治一天比一天严重的时候，美国政府中的反动派，对于中国反动派所支持的国民党政府，却是成正比地继续加强援助，特别是继续在军事运输与军火供给上，加以狂烈的援助。在一月初的停战协议中，国民党政府代表张群，曾向中共代表周恩来与美国代表马歇尔声明，运往东北的国民党军队，只限于一个不大的数目，以后在二月下旬签订的整军方案，又具体规定东北国民党第一期驻军，限于五个军。三月下旬在东北停战协议中，国民党代表张治中和美国代表齐兰，又一致声明，运往东北的国民党军，不会并不允许超过五个军。可是，在四月中旬，在国民党的五个军已经被美国海军运往东北，并在东北展开空前激烈的内战以后，美国海军仍不顾中国共产党方面的多次抗议，继续从华南运送第六十军与第九十三军到东北去。四月下旬马歇尔将军回到中国，他保证美国以后将再不会为国民党运更多的军队。可是，到了五月下旬，东北的内战更残酷了，华北的内战也更严重了，美国海军又决定把国民党的五十三军和五十四军运往东北或华北，而华南和长江下游的其他国民党军的北运，仍在准备中。很明白的，华北和东北的内战，是由美国代替国民党运送军队和军火之后，才能发生与加剧的，如果没有美国的军事运输，中国反动派要在东北华北进行大规模的内战，就根本没有可能。
    从日本投降以后（就是说在内战中而不是在抗战中）到现在，美国庞大的海军和陆空军驻在中国各地，屡次声明要撤退，而屡次延期，现在连美军的家属都运来中国，表示美军已经把中国看作他们的基地了。他们在中国不但帮助内战的发动和运兵，并帮助他们看守和修理港口、铁路、矿山，训练他们作战和使用美国供给的轰炸机、军舰、坦克、大炮、及其他各种杀人利器，直到进行特务工作。美国在中国抗战结束、内战开始以后，给内战发动者装备了四十个美械师（而在抗战期间只装备了二十个师，这二十个师的绝大部分也是用于内战，并未用于抗战），组织了海军和空军，供给他们大量的飞机、舰船、火箭炮、大炮、坦克、汽油、以及其他一切战争物资，直至军官和士兵的日用品。很明白，没有美国这些军火的援助，中国的反动派，是不能进行大规模内战的。
    在上述情况之下，中国人民不得不怀疑到今天的事实，究竟是蒋介石的凶恶内战政策要求美国的狂烈军事干涉，还是美国的狂烈军事干涉要求蒋介石的凶恶内战政策？中国人民不得不注意到，美国的军事干涉，是不会没有帝国主义目的的，说不定那一天，美国将要向中国索取军事基地和政治经济权利，使中国实际上降为美国的保护国和殖民地，而蒋介石之不惜牺牲国家民族利益和人民生命财产，来换得外国军事干涉，以巩固自己的独裁地位，乃是一种汉奸卖国贼的行为。无论如何，美国政府中反动派的军事干涉，是危害着中国的民族安全，危害着中国的和平与民主，危害着中美友谊和世界和平。这种政策，显然与莫斯科三国外长会议的约束不相符合，显然与杜鲁门不以军事干涉影响中国任何内争过程的宣言，和马歇尔停止中国内战的努力不相符合，与美国人民和美国政府中和平民主人士的愿望不相符合。因此，美国的这种错误政策，在美国国内与在中国同样受到各方面的批评和责难。
    早在二月间，马歇尔将军就承认中国的少数顽固分子自私自利，即摧毁虽国大多数人民所渴望的和平与繁荣生活的欲求，亦在所不顾。在五月间，他又重复指出，中国的好战分子，将使中国重陷于全面的战争火焰，并使中国人民遭受不堪的灾难。现在以蒋介石为首的中国反动派，正在辽宁、辽北、吉林、热河、河北、山东、山西、豫东、豫南、湖北、皖东、苏北，到处发动进攻，使内战重行发展为全国的规模。反动派已宣布在上海和北平，并将在它所统治的其他一切地方，实行法西斯的警管区制和特种户口登记制，实行敌伪的国民身份证制和查问哨制，实行所谓“非常时期维持治安紧急办法”（即一九三六年内战时期“维持治安紧急办法”之复活）；在北平查封七十七种报纸和期刊；在上海、广州、沈阳和其他地方，任意没收和查禁书报；在西安南通和其他地方，实行野蛮的屠杀和逮捕政策，成百成千的教员、学生、新闻记者、工人、妇女、和民主分子被捕杀，各地成万的政治犯不但没有释放，而且很多被秘密惨杀；在四川西部，西康东部，二十万农民被屠杀；在中国南部各省，几千万人民在腐败而贪横的统治下被饿死，仅湖南一省，就饿死了三百二十万人。中国反动派是依靠着什么人的支持和援助，才敢于并可能把这个不堪的灾难加于中国人民的呢？谁也不能否认，中国反动派是仅仅依靠着美国反动分子的军事干涉政策的支持和援助，否则中国早已获得和平与民主了。中国人民在对日作战结束之后，仍然被外国武器所屠杀——这就是美国的武器，中国人民今天的灾难，根本上乃是美国反动分子制造与助长中国内战的政策所赐予，美国的军事干涉，使杜鲁门声明中许多庄严的词句，变为不能令人信任，使美国对中国内战的调解地位，令人怀疑。中国人民为了自己的生存，为了中国的和平民主，为了中美友谊、国际信义和国际安全，不能不要求美国政府立即停止这种违反莫斯科三国会议约束的不正义不人道的罪恶政策，立即停止帮助蒋介石运兵，停止供给蒋介石武器物资和其他任何援助，立即撤回一切驻华美军，和收回已经给予蒋介石的一切军火物资。中国人民相信，中美友谊是不能被破坏的，中国人民相信，爱好和平民主正义人道的美国人民，必能与中国人民团结一致，奋起纠正美国助长中国内战和恐怖的军事干涉政策。
