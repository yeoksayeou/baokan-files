    Peking University Faculty and Students Produce in Spare Time
    Reclaiming 160 Mu of Wasteland into Fertile Fields
    Taihang Second Middle School Completes Sowing
    [This newspaper, Xingtai] The entire faculty and students of North China University, with the greatest excitement and enthusiasm, have reclaimed 160 mu of wasteland near the school into fertile fields. Currently, they are using all their spare time to rush to sow the seeds. Principal Fan Wenlan called on all students not to think that just because they have become university students they should be divorced from labor. Production is the basic driving force for social progress, and everyone should participate with the greatest enthusiasm. Gaining concrete production knowledge and technology from production will be of great help to all students aiming to build a new society. The whole school is currently filled with an atmosphere of "labor production is the most glorious," and all professors are also actively participating.
    [This newspaper, Changzhi] Under the call to complete the "Hundred Stone Fine Grain" production task, the students of Taihang Second Middle School have been swept into a production upsurge. After all 90 mu of the school's land was sown, they turned to personal production upsurges such as growing melons and vegetables, raising chickens, and spinning cotton. Due to the rational organization of labor, each person uses only an average of one and a half workdays, without affecting their studies at all. Special care is given to comrades with weaker physiques during production. In addition, agricultural knowledge is being learned, fertilizers are being researched, and one mu of experimental fields has been opened to study the combination of theory and practice. The students are very interested in this approach.

    垦百六十亩荒地为良田
    太行二中完成下种
    【本报邢台讯】北方大学全体师生，以最大的兴奋与热情，将校附近的一百六十亩荒地，开垦为良田。目前在以课余时间，全力突击下种，校长范文澜氏号召全校同学不要以为作了大学生就应该脱离劳动，生产是推动社会前进的基本动力，大家应以最大的热情参加，从生产中获得具体的生产知识与技术，这对于建设新社会为目标的全体同学，会有很大的帮助。全校目前正洋溢着一种劳动生产最光荣的空气，各教授亦均踊跃参加。
    【本报长治讯】太行二中学生，在完成“百石细粮”的生产任务号召下，全体卷入生产热潮中，全校九十亩地完全下种后，即转入种瓜种菜养鸡纺花等个人生产热潮中。由于劳力组织的合理，平均每人仅用一个半工，一点也不误学习。生产中对体弱同志特别照顾。另外还结合着学习农事知识，研究肥料，另辟一亩实验田，研究结合实验，同学们对此种作法，兴趣很大。
