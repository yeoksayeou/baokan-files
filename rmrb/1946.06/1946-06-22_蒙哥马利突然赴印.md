　　蒙哥马利突然赴印
    【新华社延安十八日电】耶路撒冷讯：据英官方宣布：蒙哥马利已于十六日离巴勒斯坦飞印，此行甚为突然。因前揭露的蒙氏行程，并无印度之行一项。官方公告未提及蒙氏赴印之性质，唯一般认为此行当与目前印局的发展有关。按蒙氏于十日由开罗赴黎巴嫩，十四日抵巴勒斯坦，十五日曾赴外约旦一行。在上述各地，他与各当地英军政当局举行会谈。英方披露蒙氏之任务，在研究中东战犯问题，随后他将访地中海意希等国。
    【新华社延安十八日电】新德里讯：英阁使团与印督魏菲尔十七日发表声明，威胁印方接受其圈定之临时政府名单。声明称：鉴于组织政府未能获致协议之基础，他们认为一切讨论应告终止。印督正向十四位被指定的人发出请柬，邀其参加印督领导下的临时国民政府。声明称：即令国大党或回教同盟指定的各四人中的任何一人拒绝参加临时政府的话，印督将着手组织一临时政府，由愿意接受英方计划的代表参加。
