　　Expose the Landlords' Conspiracy to Divide the Peasants
　　Poor Peasants in Kaihua Village Unite to Overthrow Their Oppressors

　　[Report from our newspaper in Yangcheng] Kaihua Village in Yicheng County, Taiyue, was a stronghold for local traitors, spies, and tyrannical landlords within a radius of ten *li*. Tian Shuji, the head of the group along with twenty others fled in early February. He left his confidants, such as Tian Shuxun, to carry out sabotage activities. After March, as a wave of mass movements to counter traitors and conduct liquidations surged, Tian Shuxun organized a "Mobilization Committee," which was later renamed the "Peasant Association," specifically to undermine the mass movement. They forced over a dozen middle-peasant households to give up two to three hundred *mu* of land to be distributed to poor peasants, provoking internal strife among the peasants. He himself, however, did not touch his more than one *qing* of good land. After the leadership inspected the work and learned of his conspiracy, they organized the masses in the village in mid-May to deliberate and rebuild the Peasant Association. The first task was to resolve the issues between the middle and poor peasants, uniting all peasants to jointly carry out the struggle for emancipation. They patiently persuaded the poor peasants not to take the middle peasants' land and organized the poor peasants to discuss questions such as: "Are middle peasants and poor peasants one family?" "What land should we take, and what land should we not take?" "Who owes us debts, and who is oppressing and exploiting us?" Through discussion, everyone realized that middle peasants also live by their own labor, just like us, and their land is earned with blood and sweat, so we should not take it. One poor peasant exclaimed with emotion: "I have been taken advantage of by others for half my life, and I understand the suffering of those who are taken advantage of! Tian Shuxun can cheat people, but we can't follow him and eat bewitched food!" The land problem between the middle and poor peasants was smoothly resolved. With a clear understanding, everyone then reflected on the issue of the many labor debts from when Tian Shuji forced the masses to fill ditches for him when he was a traitor, demanding struggle and reckoning; during the deliberation, many middle peasants also made the same demands, so the middle and poor peasants united and launched a large-scale struggle of liquidation and grievance, resulting in the calculation that the peasants had provided over two thousand workdays of unpaid service for Tian Shuji personally, demanding compensation for the wages they deserved. Tian's family, having lost the argument, admitted their mistake and were willing to give up more than eighty *mu* of land to compensate for the labor wages. When distributing this land, the middle peasants claimed that they had enough land to cultivate and did not need to be allocated any. The leadership enlightened everyone to discuss: "Should the middle peasants be allocated land to compensate for their wages?" Everyone believed that "the middle peasants did the work and participated in the struggle, and they should be allocated a share of the wages recovered, so that we can unite and be fair." As a result of this arrangement, the middle peasants all reflected: "The government is truly reasonable, and everyone who contributed effort gets a share." Later, the poor and middle peasants continued to deliberate on the issues of rent reduction and debt clearance, quickly entering the struggle for rent reduction and debt clearance. Many middle peasants who had been deceived in the past withdrew from Tian Shuxun's fake peasant association and joined the new peasant association, further strengthening the unity between the middle and poor peasants.

　　揭破地主分化农民阴谋
    开化村中贫农团结翻身
    【本报阳城讯】太岳翼城县开化村，是当地十来里以内的汉奸、特务、恶霸地主堡垒。以田树基为首的二十多个首脑分子，二月初就逃了。留下其心腹人田树勋等进行破坏活动。三月以后，各地涌起了群众反奸清算浪潮，田树勋即组织了一个“动员委员会”，后来又改名为“农会”，专门破坏群众运动。他们强迫十几户中农，拿出二三百亩地，分与贫农，挑起农民内争。他自己一顷多好地，却完全不动。领导上检查工作，获悉其阴谋后，即于五月中旬组织该村群众酝酿，重建农会。第一步任务就是解决中贫农之间的问题，团结全体农民，以便共同进行翻身斗争。耐心说服贫农，不要中农的土地，组织贫农讨论：“中农与贫农是不是一家人”，“该要什么土地，不该要什么土地”，“谁欠咱的债，谁是压迫剥削咱的”等问题。经过讨论，大家认识到中农也是靠劳动生活，和咱一样，人家的土地都是血汗换来，咱们不应该要。有一个贫农感叹的说：“咱叫人亏了半辈子，懂得吃亏人的苦处！田树勋能亏人，咱可不能跟上他吃迷心食，”中贫农的土地问题顺利解决了。大家认识明确，随即反映出田树基过去当汉奸时强迫群众替他填沟的许多工帐问题，要求斗争、算帐；酝酿中，许多中农也都有同样要求，于是中贫农都团结起来，展开了清算与诉苦的大斗争，结果，算出农民为田树基个人无偿服役，共二千多工，要求偿还应得工资。田家理屈认错，愿出八十多亩地偿还工钱。在分配这些地时，中农自称土地够种，可以不分。领导上启发大家讨论：“中农应不应该分得偿工资的地”，大家认为“中农做了工，又参加了斗争，斗回工价来应该分配的，这样才能团结，才算合理”。这样处理结果中农都反映：“政府认理真，谁出了气力总有份。”以后贫农中农就继续酝酿减租清债问题，很快进入了减租清债斗争。许多过去被骗的中农，都从田树勋的假农会自动退出，加入了新农会，中贫农之间更加团结。
