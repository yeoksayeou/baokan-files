    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: TASS dispatch: Soviet News observer Andrei Yev in an article commenting on "The Development of the Indonesian Question" stated: Considering Indonesia's invincibility, London has drafted a new plan for resolving the Indonesian question. On April 12th, Dutch Prime Minister Schermerhorn, accompanied by the Dutch Foreign Minister, the Colonial Minister, and Dutch East Indies Governor-General van Mook, went to London to receive this new plan. It stipulates recognizing the Indonesian Republican government as the government of Java, excluding the areas occupied by the Allied forces. The creators of this so-called "concession" are primarily seeking to separate certain parts of Indonesia to prevent Indonesia's unification and true independence. Because an Indonesian Republic limited to only part of Java would certainly be politically and economically vulnerable. Indonesian newspapers severely criticized the British and Dutch "new plan." The Indonesian Daily directly stated: "The British and Dutch proposal attempts to create the old order under a new guise." The Indonesian government and public unanimously pointed out that the plan is an attempt to divide Indonesia and has been rejected.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: According to a Moscow broadcast on the 12th: The Indonesian Student League Congress discussed the issue of defending Indonesia and resisting foreign invaders, and organized volunteer corps under the command of the Republic's Ministry of Defense. Indonesian magazines stated: A large number of newly arrived Dutch troops are landing in Batavia, and the war is expanding. But it claimed: The Indonesian Republic has become stronger than ever and is not afraid of any offensive. The Netherlands' actions will make the United Nations even more sympathetic to the Indonesian Republic and further strengthen Indonesia internally.

    英荷企图分割印尼
    遭到印尼朝野抨击
    【新华社延安十五日电】塔斯社电：苏联消息报观察家安德烈也夫在评“印度尼西亚问题发展”一文中称：鉴于印尼的不可征服，伦敦方面对印尼问题的解决，拟就了一新的计划。四月十二日，荷总理沙尔曼嘉姆偕荷外长、殖民部长与荷印总督穆克赴伦敦聆取此新计划。其中规定承认印尼共和政府为爪哇政府，而盟军占领的地区，则除外。此计划的制作者，在规定此种所谓“让步”时，首先是在寻求将分离印尼某些部份出来，以防止印尼的统一与真正独立。因为仅仅限于爪哇一部的印尼共和国会确定其在政治上与经济上的脆弱。印尼报纸剧烈抨击英荷的“新方案”，印度尼西亚日报直接了当地说：“英荷建议的企图，是在新的外套下创立旧的秩序”。印尼朝野一致指出，该计划为分割印尼的企图，已加以拒绝。
    【新华社延安十三日电】据莫斯科十二日广播：印度尼西亚学生同盟代表大会，讨论保卫印尼与防御外寇的问题，并组织志愿兵团，受共和国国防部指挥。印尼杂志谓：新运来的大批荷军，正在巴达维亚登陆，战事正扩张中。但称：印尼共和国，已空前壮大，不畏任何进攻。荷兰的行动，将使联合国家更加同情印尼共和国，并使印尼内部更加加强。
