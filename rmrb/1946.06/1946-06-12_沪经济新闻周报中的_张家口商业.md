Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. According to the Shanghai Economic News Weekly, Volume 4, Issue 47 (published April 18th), prices in Zhangjiakou have consistently remained stable because its trade, under a free policy, involves the mutual exchange of handicraft and agricultural products from towns and villages with industrial goods from the city. Zhangjiakou's commerce was prosperous before the war, and it is even more prosperous now. Before the war, there were a total of 2,252 shops in the city. After eight years of enemy rule, this number decreased to 1,981. After the victory, it recovered to 2,244 shops (note: the number of businesses in Zhangjiakou has now increased to 2,716), among which more than 120 shops specialize in transporting tea, homespun cloth, and silk from Inner Mongolia.

    沪经济新闻周报中的
    张家口商业
    【新华社延安七日电】据上海经济新闻周报四卷四十七期（四月十八日出版）报导，张家口的物价始终保持着稳定，因为它的贸易在自由政策下，出入城镇乡村的手工业产品农产品，与城市的工业品，是彼此相互交换的贸易。战前张垣的商业是繁荣的，现在更加繁荣了。在战前全市共两千二百五十二家商店，经敌寇八年的统治，减少到一千九百八十一家。胜利后恢复到两千二百四十四家，（按现在张市商号已增至二千七百十六家），其中一百二十余家商店，专事贩运内蒙的茶叶、土布和绸缎。
