    More Than a Dozen Military Units Directly Subordinate
    Help the Masses Harvest Wheat for Three Days
    [This Newspaper Report] With the wheat harvest in the Handan Plain already underway, more than a dozen directly subordinate units, including the headquarters and political department of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region, the Art Troupe, the Communications Branch Bureau, the Communications School, and the Guard Regiment, in accordance with the People's Army's consistent glorious tradition of helping the masses with agricultural production during the busy season, have specially decided to spend three days helping the families of revolutionary martyrs, poor farmers without labor, and landlords with the wheat harvest, so that they can carry out autumn planting in a timely manner. At present, all units have contacted district and village cadres and are preparing various tools. The Military Region Political Department, the Transportation School, and the 3rd Guard Company have already begun to help with the harvest. Every comrade, with a high level of enthusiasm for service, ensuring that "not a single grain of wheat is wasted," is tirelessly harvesting and transporting in the fields all day long. During the harvest, the villagers tell the comrades in the army about their stories of liberation, while the comrades in the army tell them the news that the Kuomintang reactionaries are determined to expand the civil war and plunder the wheat of the people in the liberated areas. At the same time, they also expressed that the People's Army, the Eighth Route Army, must smash the dog heads of those invaders and protect the people, protect the people's grain. In the casual conversation, the close and united friendship between the army and the people is overflowing on the smiling faces of every harvester. (Shi An)

    军直十余单位
    帮群众收麦三天
    【本市讯】邯郸平原麦收已经开始。晋冀鲁豫军区司令部、政治部、文艺工作团、通讯分局、通讯学校与警卫团等十余直属单位，本着人民军队一贯帮助群众农忙生产的光荣传统，特决定三天时间，帮助抗属、贫苦无劳力农民和房东进行麦收，以便他们适时进行秋种。目前各单位已分别与区村干部接洽，准备各种用具。军区政治部、交通学校、警卫三连，现已开始帮助收割，每个同志都以“不浪费一穗麦”的高度服务热情，整日不停的在田间收割运送。收割中老乡们向部队同志讲述自己翻身的故事，部队同志们则告诉他们国民党反动派决心扩大内战，抢掠解放区老百姓麦子的消息，同时并表示：人民军队的八路军，一定要打碎那些侵犯者的狗头，保护老百姓，保护人民的粮食。漫谈中军民亲密团结的友谊，洋溢在每个收割者的笑脸上。（石安）
