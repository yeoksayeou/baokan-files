Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 17th: Fifty thousand citizens of Harbin gathered in Beilin Park on the 14th of this month to hold a conference to defend peace and democracy. From the hurried pace and facial expressions of the lines of citizens, their long-held indignation was fully revealed. Mr. Xie Yuqin, the chairman, stated in his opening remarks: "The purpose of this conference is to call for comprehensive and lasting peace, to stop the civil war, to unite as one, and to build a new China that is independent, free, unified, democratic, prosperous, and strong. Recalling the terror and disasters suffered by our people since the flames of civil war spread to the Northeast, it is indescribable, and the loss of life and property is incalculable. Therefore, representatives of the Songhua and Harbin people urgently gathered, repeatedly telegraphed, appealed to the government authorities for peace, advocated stopping the civil war, and opposed the United States helping the Kuomintang authorities to wage civil war." Chairman Xie finally called on the people present to invigorate their spirits and take on the heavy responsibility of striving for peace and democracy. He said: "We must place the heavy responsibility of advocating peace, opposing civil war, and opposing the sinister schemes of the US imperialist elements in fueling China's civil war on our own shoulders." Next, free speeches were held. Mr. He Zhian said: "The Kuomintang reactionaries' dispatch of troops to the Northeast to wage civil war with the Democratic Allied Army has caused the people of the Northeast to suffer even more severely than in the past fourteen years. Today, the Democratic Allied Army voluntarily withdrew from Changchun in order to seek peace, but the Kuomintang reactionaries want to continue the civil war. Who is the instigator of the civil war is very clear to everyone. We must appeal to the whole country, demanding that the United States immediately stop helping the Kuomintang. If there is no foreign aid, peace would have been achieved long ago." Mr. Dai Zhen said: "We, the people of the Northeast, have the right to manage ourselves, and no one can deprive us of our rights. Therefore, we must unite and fight against the US imperialist elements and the Kuomintang reactionaries, so that they can recognize our strength and give up their wishful thinking of riding on our heads again." Finally, the conference resolved to hold a parade. The contingent of 50,000 people marched forward in neat steps, shouting slogans demanding peace, opposing civil war, and demanding the withdrawal of US troops along the way.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 17th: Famous figures from Songhua and Harbin, Gao Chongmin, Han Youtong, Xie Yuqin, Meng Xiaoxian, and others, recently gave interviews to reporters, unanimously opposing civil war and demanding peace and democracy. They also protested against the United States helping the Kuomintang authorities to expand the civil war. Mr. Gao Chongmin, a veteran Kuomintang member, said: "Yuan Shikai wanted to become emperor, so he colluded with Japan and signed the traitorous Twenty-One Demands. Today, Chiang Kai-shek, in order to be a dictator, opposes domestic democratic forces, especially fearing that the Northeast will become a democratic bulwark, and desperately relies on the help of US imperialist elements to expand the civil war in the Northeast, which may result in the Northeast becoming an American colony." Mr. Han Youtong, a member of the Democratic League, said: "It is impossible for any country to sacrifice the Chinese people and implement imperialist policies. We demand that the United States abide by international treaties and withdraw US troops stationed in China." Mr. Xie Yuqin, president of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said: "Today, the Soviet Union has withdrawn its troops from the Northeast, but the United States has not withdrawn its troops as agreed. The people of the Northeast believe that this has ulterior motives." Mr. Liu Xianchen, president of Harbin University, said: "The most important issue at present is for the Kuomintang reactionaries to stop attacking. The United States should abide by Truman's promise not to interfere in China's internal affairs." Old educator Kong Huanshu said: "China's own affairs can be resolved by ourselves. Today, we demand peace and democracy. Whoever wants to undermine peace and democracy, we will oppose him." Mr. Meng Xiaoxian, director of the Harbin Universal Moral Society, said: "The Northeast issue should be resolved politically. We must unite the people of the whole country to appeal and strive until we achieve our goal."

    誓死保卫和平民主声彻云宵
    哈市五万群众大集会
    呼吁美国依约撤兵，停止帮助国民党反动派屠杀人民。
    【新华社哈尔滨十七日电】本月十四日哈尔滨五万市民，齐集北麟公园，举行保卫和平民主大会。从一队队市民的紧促的步伐和面部表情中，充分表露他们久藏在心中的义愤。主席谢雨琴先生在开会词，略谓：“大会宗旨是：呼吁全面的永久的和平，停止内战，一致团结，建设独立自由统一民主富强的新中国。回忆内战火焰蔓延到东北以来，我们人民所遭受的恐怖和祸害，是无法形容的，生命和财产的损失，是难以计数的。因此松哈人民代表紧急集会，再三通电，向政府当局呼吁和平，主张停止内战，并反对美国帮助国民党当局进行内战。”谢主席最后号召到会人民振作精神，担起争取和平民主的重任。他说：“我们要把主张和平、反对内战、反对美帝国主义分子阴谋助长中国内战的重担，放在自己肩头”。接着举行自由讲演，何治安先生说：“国民党反动派调兵来东北与民主联军进行内战，使东北人民遭受的痛苦比过去十四年还要利害。今天民主联军为求取和平自动撤出长春，而国民党反动派却要继续内战。谁为内战的戎首，大家看的很清楚。我们要向全国呼吁，要求美国立即停止对国民党的帮助，如果没有外国的帮助，和平早已实现了”。戴震先生说：“我们东北人民有权利管理自己，谁也不能剥夺我们的权利，因此我们就要团结起来，向美帝国主义分子和国民党反动派斗争，使他们认识我们的力量，放弃再骑在我们头上的妄想”。最后，大会决议举行游行，五万人的大队，以整齐的步伐前进，沿路高呼要求和平，反对内战，要求美国撤兵的口号。
    【新华社哈尔滨十七日电】松哈著名人士高崇民、韩幽桐、谢雨琴、孟效先等，顷对记者发表谈话，一致反对内战，要求和平民主。并抗议美国帮助国民党当局，扩大内战。老国民党员高崇民先生说：“袁世凯要做皇帝，便勾结日本签订卖国的二十一条。今天蒋介石为了要独裁，就反对国内民主力量，特别是怕东北成为民主的保垒，并拚命依靠美帝国主义分子的帮助，扩大东北内战，结果可能使东北变成美国的殖民地”。民主同盟会员韩幽桐先生说：“任何国家要想牺牲中国人民，实行帝国主义的政策，那是行不通的。我们要求美国遵守国际条约，把驻华美军撤出中国”。中苏友好协会会长谢雨琴先生说：“今天苏联撤退了在东北的军队，而美国却不依约撤兵，东北人民认为其中带有不可告人的目的”。哈尔滨大学校长刘献臣先生说：“当前首要的问题，就是要国民党反动派停止进攻。美国应该遵守杜鲁门不干涉中国内政的诺言”。老教育家孔焕书说：“中国自己的事，自己是可以解决的，今天我们要求和平民主，谁要破坏和平民主，我们就要反对他”。哈尔滨万国道德会主任孟效先先生说：“东北问题应该政治解决，我们要联合全国人民呼吁争取，不达目的誓不休止”。
