    After Gunfire Ceases After Seven Hours
    Zhoucun Market Shows New Vigor
    I am working to restore coal production in Zaozhuang and welcome representatives of investors to Zaozhuang for talks.
    A merchant said: "The democratic government's policy of supporting commerce was proven last autumn. From now on, we are not afraid of not having business!"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Boshan, 16th] The ninth was the first day of Zhoucun's re-liberation. Immediately after the fighting stopped, the Zhoucun democratic municipal government relocated to the city amidst the warm welcome of 80,000 citizens. On the same day, Mayor Shi Fengxiang and all staff members began investigating the losses suffered by citizens during the fighting in order to quickly provide relief. This municipal government was formally established based on public opinion when the Eighth Route Army first liberated the area last autumn. It had moved to the suburbs to work after Zhoucun fell into the hands of the puppet regime.
    Seven hours after the gunfire stopped, the city streets showed a new look on the second morning. On Zhucun Main Street, Malu Street, and Silk Market Street, vegetable vendors started hawking their wares at 4:30 in the morning. Merchants and civilians were busy cleaning the glass on their doors and windows. Shandong's famous Quanxiangzhuang and Hongxiangzhuang opened their doors first, followed by Ruilinxiang Cloth Shop, Sanyuantang, Liangyou Bookstore, and all the shops, big and small. National flags fluttered in front of the doors. More and more pedestrians appeared, all with joyful expressions, congratulating each other, and eliminating the disasters of the puppet army. A beggar begged for food in front of a shop, and the manager said to the clerk, "It's a good day for the first day, give him more!"
    A Mr. from a sauce garden told reporters: "The business during the eighteen days when the Eighth Route Army liberated Zhoucun, from July 21st to early August 9th last year, was more than half a year’s worth. Rice and cloth were both cheap, but the Eighth Route Army left soon after." They resolutely hoped: "The Eighth Route Army will live here forever from now on."
    After breakfast, the reporter visited several large shops such as Quanxiang and Hongxiang. They received him warmly and asked many questions. Although Kuomintang planes from Jinan frequently came to strafe violently, even disrupting our conversation several times within an hour and a half, they still hoped for peace and that the Kuomintang could consider the lives of the people and the nation and abandon the policy of civil war. In the past, Zhoucun merchants were forced to bear extremely heavy burdens by the puppet army. In just five months this year, Quanxiang alone bore 3 million yuan in legal tender. Five hours before liberation, they were forced to hand over 300,000 yuan in comfort donations. They wanted to close down, but they were not allowed. In this way, their inventory gradually ran out. Manager Jiao told reporters: "The democratic government's policy of supporting commerce was proven last autumn. From now on, we are not afraid of not having business!" When the reporter was having an exciting conversation with several clerks at Hengxiang, they suddenly heard the sharp sound of a train whistle. It was 1:00 PM, and the train had arrived at Zhoucun Station. This event immediately excited the people of the city. A Mr. Li said: "Once the train is running, merchants will have good business." When the reporter went to the station and met Stationmaster Liu, he learned that the railway from Zhoucun to Longshan, more than one hundred li long, would be selling tickets tomorrow, and the Zhangdian and Zhangbo branch lines to the east would also be fully operational soon.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 16th] As the Shandong New Fourth Army, at the request of the people, relieved the puppet army Wang Jimei's troops, the order in Zaozhuang quickly stabilized, and production at the Zhongxing Coal Mine was about to begin, and group negotiations were also restored. U.S. representative Lieutenant Colonel Mercier of the Executive Group was extremely safe due to our friendly protection during the battle in Zaozhuang. After the Zhongxing Company was liberated, Mercier expressed his deep gratitude to Commander Chen's special representative for coming to express his condolences. The group also plans to resume peace talks. On the 12th, they discussed mining operations, which went very smoothly. Our side still adheres to the consistent principle of peace and unity in the past and strives to quickly restore coal production in Zaozhuang. We welcome Mr. Li Hongji, the representative of the investors, to Zaozhuang for talks, and declare that after the establishment of the escort police brigade, the CCP troops will immediately withdraw from the mining area, and the escort police will be responsible for guarding the mines and the safety of the group. Lieutenant Colonel Mercier expressed his admiration for our side's spirit of peace and unity in abiding by the peace agreement.

    枪声停止七小时后
    周村街市气象更新
    我力谋恢复枣庄煤矿生产，欢迎资方代表来枣会谈。
    商人说：“民主政府扶植商业的政策，去秋已经证明，今后我们不怕没生意做了！”
    【新华社博山十六日电】九日是周村重新解放的第一天，在战斗刚刚停止后，周村民主市政府就在八万市民的热烈欢迎中重行移驻市内，当天石凤翔市长和全体工作人员，就开始调查市民在战斗中损失情形，以便迅速进行救济。这个市政府，在去秋八路军第一次解放该地时就依据民意正式成立，后因周村沦陷伪手，才移至郊外办公。
    在枪声停止后七小时的第二天早晨，市街上已呈现出崭新气象，箸村大街、马路街、丝市街，早晨四时半，青菜贩就开始叫卖，商民们忙着擦洗门窗上的玻璃，山东有名的泉祥庄、鸿祥庄，首先开了门，接着瑞林祥布庄、三元堂、良友书社以及所有大小店铺，也都开门营业，门前飘扬着国旗，行人越来越多，都面露喜色，互相祝贺，从此破除了伪军的灾难。有个乞丐在一家店铺门前乞食，经理对店员说：“第一天好日子，多给他点”！
    一个酱园的先生告诉记者说：“去年阳历七月二十一日到八月初九日，八路军解放周村十八天中的买卖，比半年还多，米和布都贱了，可是不久八路军就走了。”他们坚决地希望：“八路军从此永远住在这里。”
    早饭后，记者往访泉祥、鸿祥等几家大铺子，他们热情的接谈，并询问许多问题。虽然济南的国民党飞机经常来猛烈扫射，在我们谈话的一个半小时内，就来骚扰多次，但他们仍希望能够和平，希望国民党能为国家民命设想，放弃内战政策。过去周村商家被伪军强迫负担是极重的，今年五个月内仅泉祥就负担三百万元法币，解放前五小时，还硬逼去三十万元的慰劳捐，他们想关门，但是不准，就这样，货底子逐渐的闹光了。焦经理告诉记者：“民主政府扶植商业的政策，在去秋已经有了证明，今后我们不怕没有生意”！当记者在恒祥和几位店员谈得正有劲时，忽然听到火车拉笛的尖锐声音，这时是下午一点，火车开到了周村站，这件事情立即兴奋了全市的人民。一位姓李的先生说：“火车一通来了，商客卖买就好了”。当记者赶赴车站有见刘站长时，得悉周村四至龙山段长百余华里铁路，明天即可卖票，东去张店和张博支路，也马上就要完全通车了。
    【新华社临沂十六日电】由于山东新四军应人民请求，解除伪军王继美部后，枣庄秩序迅速安定，中兴煤矿生产即将开始，小组谈判亦告恢复。执行小组美方代表梅西亚中校，在枣庄战斗中，由于我方友好保护，极为安全。当中兴公司解放后，梅氏对陈军长特派代表前来慰问，深表感谢。该小组并拟恢复和平谈判。十二日已商讨矿务工作，甚为融洽。我方仍本过去坚持和平团结的一贯主张，力谋迅速恢复枣庄煤矿生产。对资方代表黎洪基先生来枣会谈，表示欢迎，并声明在护警大队成立后，中共部队将即撤出矿区，由护警负责担任警卫矿井与小组的安全。梅西亚中校对我方遵守和平协定之和平团结精神，极表赞佩。
