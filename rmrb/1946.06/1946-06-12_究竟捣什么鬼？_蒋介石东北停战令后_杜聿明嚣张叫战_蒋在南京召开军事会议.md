    What on Earth is Going On?
    Chiang Kai-shek Issues Ceasefire Order in Northeast
    But Du Yuming Arrogantly Calls for War
    Chiang Convenes Military Conference in Nanjing
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th] According to a United Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 8th: "Du Yuming, Commander-in-Chief of the National Army in the Northeast, declared today that if no agreement is reached within the 15-day ceasefire period, his troops will launch a new offensive to seize all of Manchuria from the Communists. He warned against excessive optimism, and said that in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty and the demands of the people, the National Army will still resume its offensive." It is noteworthy that Du Yuming made such provocative remarks only two days after Chiang Kai-shek issued the order for a 15-day ceasefire in the Northeast.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th] According to the Nanjing Xinmin Daily of the 4th of this month: After Chiang Kai-shek returned to Nanjing, he will soon summon, in stages, battalion-level and above commanders of troops under the jurisdiction of the Nanjing-Shanghai area, Beiping, the Wuhan Headquarters, and the Guangzhou and Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters to give them "instructions." Furthermore, Zhang Fakui, Li Pinxian, Yu Hanmou, Tang Enbo, Luo Zhuoying, and others have also arrived in Nanjing one after another, and an important military conference will be held in Nanjing.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th] Moscow Radio's TASS correspondent in Shanghai reported: Japanese troops from the Taiwan area have been incorporated into the Chinese Kuomintang army and are being used to fight against the Chinese People's Revolutionary Army. The corpses of hundreds of Taiwanese officers and soldiers can prove this. The correspondent stated: "The Chinese secret police and secret service agencies are mostly composed of Japanese people."

    究竟捣什么鬼？
    蒋介石东北停战令后
    杜聿明嚣张叫战
    蒋在南京召开军事会议
    【新华社延安九日电】据合众社南京八日电称：“东北国军总司令杜聿明今日宣称在十五日停战期内未能获致协议，则如他的军队将发动新进攻，自共产党手中夺取全部满洲。他警告不可过度乐观，并谓按照中苏条约及人民要求，国军仍将恢复其进攻。按在蒋介石发布东北停战十五天的命令后两天，杜聿明竟然发表此种挑衅的谈话，殊堪注意。
    【新华社延安九日电】据本月四日南京新民报刊载：蒋介石返京后，最近即将分期召见京沪区、北平、武汉行营，广州、徐州绥靖公署所属部队营级以上部队长，有所“训话”。又：张发奎、李品仙、余汉谋、汤恩伯、罗卓英等，亦已先后来京，将有重要军事会议在京举行。
    【新华社延安九日电】莫斯科广播塔斯社驻上海记者报导：台湾地区的日军，已编入中国国民党军，并被利用对中国人民革命军作战。已有数百个台湾军官与士兵的尸体，可为证明。该记者称：“中国秘密警察及特务机关，大部分系日人所组成”。
