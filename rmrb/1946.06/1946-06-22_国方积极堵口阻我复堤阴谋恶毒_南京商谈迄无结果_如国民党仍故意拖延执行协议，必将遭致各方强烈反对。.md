    The Nationalist Side Actively Blocks the Breach, Obstructing Our Scheme to Rebuild the Levee, a Malicious Plot;
    Nanjing Negotiations Remain Unresolved;
    If the Kuomintang Continues to Deliberately Delay the Implementation of the Agreement, It Will Inevitably Encounter Strong Opposition from All Parties.
    [Our Newspaper, Heze, 18th Dispatch] Mr. He Youqi, who previously accompanied Wang Xiaoyi, the representative of the Yellow River Commission of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, to Nanjing to discuss with the Nationalist side issues such as the supply of funds and materials for the project and resettlement relief funds, returned to Heze on the 15th. According to him, Wang, He, and the others, after arriving in Nanjing, held five rounds of discussions with Xue Dubi, Director of the Water Conservancy Commission of the Executive Yuan, and Jiang Tingfu, Director of the Executive Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), respectively. Regarding the issue of project funds, the Nanjing agreement originally stipulated that 10 billion yuan would be allocated by the Water Conservancy Commission of the Executive Yuan and directly transferred to the Yellow River control authorities of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region by UNRRA. However, during the negotiations, Xue initially disregarded the agreement, claiming that UNRRA should be responsible for raising the funds, while Jiang Tingfu then stated that UNRRA did not have such funds and could only allocate them with the approval of the Executive Yuan. Xue then went on to say: 3 billion yuan of project funds had already been allocated to the Kaifeng Yellow River Commission, in an attempt to delay and evade the issue. As for the issue of resettlement relief funds, no progress was made. According to Mr. He, the Kuomintang is still actively carrying out the breaching closure project at Huayuankou. The pile driving project is more than half completed and will be completed in ten days. They are now rushing to build protective pile revetments. Only 200 meters remain at the breach. 100 million cubic meters of stone have been transported to the site, and they plan to start excavating the diversion canal on the 16th.
    The person in charge of the Yellow River Commission of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region severely criticized the Kuomintang for not implementing the Nanjing agreement, stating: The liberated area government has faithfully implemented the agreement, mobilizing 230,000 people and starting work for more than ten days. However, the Kuomintang not only fails to provide the agreed materials, grain, and funds, but also the Nationalist representatives to the six-person committee and the UNRRA office in Heze, which were agreed upon in the Nanjing agreement, have not yet been sent, making it impossible for the two organizations to work. This is clearly a deliberate delay, while on the other hand, they are still actively closing the breach. Their intentions are extremely noteworthy. We still hope that the Kuomintang will promptly and earnestly implement the Nanjing agreement; otherwise, it will inevitably encounter strong opposition from the people of the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, as well as from righteous people at home and abroad.

　　国方积极堵口阻我复堤阴谋恶毒
    南京商谈迄无结果
    如国民党仍故意拖延执行协议，必将遭致各方强烈反对。
    【本报荷泽十八日电】前偕冀鲁豫黄委会代表王笑一赴京与国方商谈工款物资供给及迁移救济费等问题之何幼奇氏，于十五日返抵荷泽，据谈，王、何等三氏抵京后，分别与行政院水委会主任薛笃弼及行总主任蒋廷黻先后商谈五次。关于工款问题，南京协议本商定由行政院水委会筹拨一百亿元，由行总直接转交冀鲁豫治河机关，但在商谈时，薛初则不顾协议，诿称应由行总负责筹拨，而蒋廷黻则又称行总无此款项，经行政府院核准后始可代拨。薛继则又谓：工款已拨交开封黄委会三十亿元，以图拖延应付，至于迁移救济费问题，则未获任何结果。又据何氏称：花园口堵口工程，国民党仍在积极进行，打桩工程已完成过半，十日后即可竣工，现正赶筑护桩埽，河口现仅余二百公尺，该处已运到石料一万万方，并拟于十六日开始挖掘引河。
    冀鲁豫黄委会负责人对于国民党方面不执行南京协议，严加指斥称：解放区政府忠实执行协议，已动员群众二十三万人，动工十余日，而国民党方面不仅不供给商定之物资粮款，且南京协议中所商定组织之六人委员会及行总驻荷泽办事处国方代表迄未派来，致使该两组织至今无法工作，显系故意拖延，而另外一方面，则仍积极进行堵口，其企图极堪注意。我们仍希望国民党方面从速切实执行南京协议，否则必遭冀鲁豫皖苏五省人民及国内外正义人士之强烈反对。
