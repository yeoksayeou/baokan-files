Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: The Shanxi-Suiyuan Branch of the China Liberated Areas Relief Association has telegraphed UNRRA and CNRRA, protesting against Yan Xishan's fraudulent acquisition of relief supplies from the Jin-Cha-Sui Relief Sub-Office under the pretext of the people in the liberated areas, and demanding a fair distribution of relief materials. The telegram stated: "Recently, we saw in the Jin-Cha-Sui Relief Sub-Office's weekly report that the total distribution of materials included over 130,000 boxes of milk powder, 3,000 tons of flour, and 10 trucks, not including miscellaneous materials." According to the sub-office's consistent practice of distributing materials, our Shanxi-Suiyuan Liberated Area, specifically the four million people in western Shanxi, should have received 26,000 boxes of milk powder and 600 tons of flour, but so far, we have received nothing. Yan Xishan has included 36 counties, such as Zuoyun and Youyu, in the Shanxi part of our Shanxi-Suiyuan Liberated Area, into his area of control, and fraudulently obtained relief supplies under the name of 105 counties. For example, in April, all 37,752 boxes of milk powder transported to Taiyuan were exclusively occupied by Yan. The four million people in our Shanxi-Suiyuan Liberated Area demand that UNRRA and CNRRA fairly and reasonably distribute relief materials, and investigate and punish Yan Xishan's crime of embezzling relief materials!

Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 19th: The Kuomintang authorities in Qingdao are obstructing UNRRA relief supplies from entering the Shandong Liberated Area in every possible way. When the representative of the Shandong Liberated Area Relief Committee returned to Laiyang after negotiating relief work with UNRRA and CNRRA, they were escorted by UNRRA personnel, but were still detained by the police bureau on the way. After repeated negotiations, they were forced to return to UNRRA. Ships transporting supplies from the liberated area port of Shijiusuo (the port east of Rizhao County) to Qingdao are also surrounded and monitored by police dispatched by the Qingdao Kuomintang authorities. After the ships left the port, the CNRRA Shandong-Qingdao branch connected to the Qingdao Garrison Command and declared: "Recently, pirates have been rampant. We are not responsible for any accidents involving ships carrying relief supplies from Shijiusuo." Fortunately, this time, the ships were escorted by US military speedboats, and were able to safely reach the territorial waters of the liberated area. In order to quickly transport the relief supplies from Shijiusuo to the interior, UNRRA specially decided to send a transportation team to carry over a hundred barrels of gasoline needed for transportation. However, the Qingdao Garrison Command declared: "The overall situation is tense, and materials are not allowed to leave Qingdao." After four or five days of negotiations, a permit was finally obtained, but when it was about to be exported, the authorities used the excuse that the vehicles were military supplies and forced the permit to be returned. Later, after the UNRRA负责人persoanlly went to the Garrison Command to negotiate reasonably, only forty barrels of gasoline were allowed to be transported out. On May 23rd, Li Xianliang openly demanded in an official letter to UNRRA's Qi Hefu that relief supplies should no longer be transported to the liberated area. The Qingdao military authorities also expressed the same unreasonable view. On May 9th, the editorial of the Qingdao Kuomintang newspaper *Minyan Daily*, with the title "Breaking Through Difficulties, Everyone is Responsible," accused UNRRA and CNRRA of not fully cooperating with their steps, believing that they were "supporting the enemy," and attempting to force relief agencies to also participate in their internal war of poisoning the people.

    青岛国方竟阻联总物资运入我区
    【新华社延安十八日电】中国解放区救济总会晋绥分会，致电联总、行总，抗议阎锡山假借解放区人民名义，向晋察绥救济分署骗取救济物资之事件，要求公平分配救济物资。原电略称：“近见中国善后救济总署晋察绥分署周报所刊行总分给物资牛乳十三万余箱，面粉三千吨，卡车十辆，零星物资尚未计在内”，依该分署分配物资贯例，我晋绥解放区，单山西部的四百万人民，即应分得牛乳二万六千箱，面粉六百吨，但至今一无所得。而阎锡山竟将我晋绥解放区山西部分之左云、右玉等三十六县，列入其统治范围，凭借一百零五县名义，骗取救济物资。如四月份，运并之牛乳三万七千七百五十二箱，悉数为阎独占，我晋绥解放区四百万人民要求联总、行总，公平合理分配救济物资，检举并惩办阎锡山私吞救济物资之罪行！
    【新华社临沂十九日电】青岛国民党当局，多方阻扰联总救济物资进入山东解放区。当山东解放区救委会代表与联总、行总接洽救济工作毕返莱阳时，由联总派员特为护送，仍于途中遭警察局扣留，经往返交涉，始折回联总。由解放区港口石臼所“日照县城东之海口）至青岛运物资之船只，亦为青岛国民党当局派警察包围监视，待船只出港后，行总鲁青分署连接青警备司令部通知，竟声称：“近来海匪猖獗，石臼所运载救济物资船只，在港外出事，我们概不负责”。此次幸有美军汽艇护送，始得安抵解放区领海。为迅速使石臼之救济物资运入内地，联总特决定由运输大队携带担负运输所必须之汽油百余筒前往运输，但青市警备司令部声称：“大局紧张，物资不准出青市”。经四五日交涉，始获得许可证，待临出口时，当局又借口汽车系军用品，又逼将许可证退回。后经联总负责人亲往警备司令部据理交涉，始允许运出汽油四十筒。五月二十三日，李先良竟公然以公函要求联总齐贺福氏，不能再将救济物资运往解放区，青市军事当局亦有同样无理表示。五月九日，青市国民党机关报《民言报》社论，以“打破困难大家负责”为题，责备联总、行总不能和他们的步骤完全配合一致，认为：“有资敌行为”，企图强迫救济机关也参加他们荼毒人民的内战。
