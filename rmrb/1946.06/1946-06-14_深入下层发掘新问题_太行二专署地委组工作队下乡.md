Going Deep into the Grassroots to Discover New Problems
Taihang Second Prefecture Committee Work Team Goes to the Countryside

[This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] The Changzhi Second District Committee and the Prefectural Office have recently decided to jointly organize three work teams to go to various places. They will understand and study new problems, new experiences, and difficulties in the progress of work in various types of regions in the Second Sub-district through concrete assistance work, to further promote the mass movement and production movement in the district. The teams have now set off on their respective journeys. The Shouyang team will mainly study the experience of combining mass movements with self-defense and production. The Changzhi team will mainly study the experience of combining production and rent reduction, as well as new problems in organizing production in new areas. The Wuxiang team will focus on studying the key to why mutual aid is not improving in old areas and how to improve it. Before their departure, Deputy Political Commissar Yu of the sub-district gave a brief instruction, pointing out that at present, the enthusiasm for production in some old areas is not high. In places like Huguan and Xiyang, there are reports that old areas are not as active as new areas. County Magistrate Li of Wuxiang discovered in his inspection that there was no new development in the old areas. The masses in Dongyangguan, Licheng said: "Mutual aid is good, but some people are unwilling to participate." This phenomenon is not due to the masses' low enthusiasm for production, but because: (1) There is not enough clarity on the direction of focusing on agriculture, combining it with sideline occupations and handicrafts, implementing it throughout the year, deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, improving technology, and achieving the goal of "cultivating three and having a surplus of one." In some areas, when transitioning from sideline occupations to agriculture, mandatory measures were taken against some of the masses engaged in sideline businesses, such as the village office refusing to issue road passes for mass transportation, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. Emphasizing agriculture and neglecting sideline occupations, and not taking into account the characteristics of various regions, is a practice that violates the interests of the masses. The correct solution should be how to organize and combine them. (2) Some cadres do not realize how to improve production in old areas. The main key to improving mutual aid is: combination must be voluntary, work points must be reasonable, and living arrangements must be democratic, rather than simply pursuing form and quantity. (3) Production and self-defense and participation in the war are not well organized. There is a lack of understanding that organizing to complete production work in a concentrated manner is a concrete preparation for self-defense, and failure to organize in a timely manner has led to delays in production. For example, in Zuoquan, due to participation in the war, the amount of fertilizer accumulated was less than last year. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct in-depth inspections, discover more problems, and create more experiences in order to improve our work.

    深入下层发掘新问题
    太行二专署地委组工作队下乡
    【本报长治讯】长治二地委及专署，顷决定共同组织三个工作组，分赴各地，从具体帮助工作中了解研究二分区各种不同类型地区工作中的新问题新经验和前进中的困难，进一步推动该区的群运与生产运动。现各组已启程首途。派赴寿阳组主要研究群运以及自卫、生产结合的经验；长治组主要研究生产减租结合的经验以及新区组织生产中的新问题；武乡组则着重研究老区互助提不高的关键和如何提高的问题。行前分区于副政委作简短指示，指出目前若干老区生产劲头不大，壶关、昔阳等地反映，老区不如新区活跃。武乡李县长检查中发现老区无新的发展，黎城东阳关群众说：“互助好是好，就是有些人不愿参加”等。这种现象不是群众生产情绪低落，而是由于：（一）对农业为主，结合副业手工业，贯彻全年，深耕细作，提高技术，达到耕三余一的方向，还不够明确。个别地区在由副业转农业时，对于某些经营副业的群众，采取了强制的办法，如群众运输，村公所不给开路条，引起群众不满。重农而不要副业，不照顾各地特点，是违犯群众利益的做法，正确解决应是如何组织与结合的问题。（二）老区生产怎样提高，某些干部不认识提高互助主要关键是：结合要自愿，折工要合理，生活安排要民主，而不是单纯形式与数量的追求。（三）生产与自卫参战组织不好，不了解组织起来突击完成生产工作，就是自卫的具体准备，不能及时组织致误了生产，如左权因参战误工积肥不如去年多。因此必须深入检查，发现更多问题，创造更多经验，才能提高工作。
