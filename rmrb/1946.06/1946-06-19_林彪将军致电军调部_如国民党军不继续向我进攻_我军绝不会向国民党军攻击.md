    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: Shenyang News: General Lin Biao of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army sent a telegram on the 13th to the Shenyang Executive Group, forwarded to the Peiping Executive Headquarters, stating: On June 11th, I received General Rao's notification of the Executive Headquarters' order to cease fire for 15 days. I had already received Chairman Mao's general order regarding the ceasefire on June 6th. I am willing to formally declare to both the American and National parties: My Northeast Democratic Allied Army has long ceased fire, including in Lafa. In the Lafa area, I have not attacked the National Army. Only when the National Army occupied my Laoyemiao on the 5th, and continued to attack my Xinzhan and Lafa areas until the afternoon of the 7th, my army, having endured to the point of being unable to retreat, rose up in self-defense. But after my army repelled the invading National Army, my army immediately stopped pursuing to avoid escalating the situation. I can assure both the National and American parties: If the National Army does not continue to attack us, my army will never attack the National Army. I can also report to the Peiping Executive Headquarters and the Shenyang Central Group: As I write this reply, government troops are still continuing to attack my army in the Faku and Haicheng-Benxi areas. At the same time, since the 9th, 10th, and 11th, National Army planes have continued to bomb my cities of Lafa, Jiaohe, and Dunhua, causing heavy casualties to my army and civilians. I welcome the Executive Group to investigate the truth in all areas with military conflict and mediate fairly. I express my gratitude to the American side for their efforts to help the Northeast cease fire and restore peace.
      Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army Lin Biao

    林彪将军致电军调部
    如国民党军不继续向我进攻
    我军绝不会向国民党军攻击
    【新华社延安十五日电】沈阳讯：东北民主联军林彪将军，十三日致电沈阳执行小组，转北平执行部称：我于六月十一日接到饶将军转达执行部停战十五日命令之通知，我早于六月六日接到毛主席关于停战之通令，我很愿向美、国双方正式声明：我东北民主联军早已停战，拉法亦在内，拉法地区，我无攻击国军之事，只有当国军于五日占我老爷庙，六日直至七日下午仍继续向我新站、拉法等地进攻时，我军始忍无可忍，退无可退，起而自卫。但当我军把来犯的国军击退后，我军即停止追击，避免事情扩大。我可向国、美双方保证：如果国军不继续向我进攻，我军绝不会向国军攻击的。我可会带向北平执行部与沈阳中心小组报告：当我写此复电时，政府军队仍在法库及海城、本溪地区继续向我军进攻。同时自九、十、十一日以来，国军飞机继续轰炸我拉法、蛟河、敦化等城，我军民伤亡甚重。我欢迎执行小组到一切有军事冲突地方调查真象，秉公调处，我对美方帮助东北停战恢复和平的努力，表示谢意。
      东北民主联军总司令林彪
      一九四六年六月十三日
