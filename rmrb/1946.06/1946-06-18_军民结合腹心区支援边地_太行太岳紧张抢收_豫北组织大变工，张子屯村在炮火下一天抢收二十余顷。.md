    Military-Civilian Integration: Core Areas Support Border Regions
    Taihang and Taiyue Mountains Vigorously Rush to Harvest
    Northern Henan Organizes Large-Scale Labor Exchange; Zhangzitun Village Harvests Over Twenty Hectares Under Fire in One Day

    [This Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Changzhi] The intense summer harvest defense war has fully unfolded in the Taihang region, particularly fiercely along the Pinghan Railway in northern Henan. Counties in northern Henan began harvesting before the Dragon Boat Festival and are now in full swing, expected to be largely completed within the week. Villages along the Pinghan Railway, including Yuan (shi), Huojia, Jing (xing), Gao (yi), and those on the edge of the liberated areas, are harvesting urgently. Along the Tongpu Railway in Shanxi, Yu (ci), Tai (gu), and Qi (xian) are also beginning to harvest. Old revolutionary base areas such as She (xian), Lin (xian), Wu (an), and Ci (xian) are also intensifying their efforts. Wheat seedlings in Chang (zhi), Lu (cheng), Li (cheng), Xiang (yuan), and Wu (xiang) counties are also yellow and ready to be harvested. All counties are currently summarizing sowing and rectifying mutual aid teams, ready to start work within days. In northern Henan and the Yuan, Huo, Gao, and Jing areas of Hebei, due to the Kuomintang army's frantic attempts to seize wheat, our counties' local armed forces and militias are concentrating on strengthening sentry posts in border villages to implement armed protection of the summer harvest.

    In northern Henan: Under the slogan "Defend the Summer Harvest," the Party, government, military, and people have all been mobilized to support villages in the border areas. All guarding troops are now combined with local armed forces and militias to strengthen surveillance of enemy strongholds. Militias have deployed landmines to block all routes that the enemy and puppet troops have previously used for harassment. On the 1st of this month, Zhangzitun Village in Huixian County, despite the urgent sound of guns and cannons from the Kuomintang army's incursions, relied on the strong resistance of our army and militia to harvest over twenty hectares. All counties have organized temporary large-scale labor exchanges, with men carrying and women cutting, rushing to harvest day and night. The newly organized armed work team of the Jiqi County militia in Jixian and Qi County each carry a rifle and a sickle, providing both vigilance and assistance. For the past half month, county and district cadres in Huixian and Huojia counties have been running around in the fields with sickles, both promoting and guiding the harvest while also helping to do the work. Militias in Xiuwu, Wuzhi, Mengxian, and Huojia counties, whether at the front or in the rear, have organized field watching teams to take turns guarding the wheat fields at night to prevent special agents from setting fires.

    In Yuan and Huo: Our guarding troops have repeatedly repelled the Kuomintang army from Yuanshi and Jingxing counties from seizing wheat. Zanhuang and Gaoyi counties, along with the old areas of Yuan, Huo, etc., have organized wheat harvest protection teams to reinforce the front-line villages of Yuan, Huo, etc., and have made strict surveillance of the Kuomintang army's strongholds and hidden special agents in the liberated areas. Militias in various counties have also organized "Joint Defense for Protecting the Summer Harvest."

    In Yu and Tai: To cut off the Yan army's claws for seizing wheat in the liberated areas, anti-traitor struggles have been launched in various villages. The summer harvest protection work teams of various counties have all set out, and county and district cadres have dispersed into the front-line villages and districts to guide harvesting and arrange for concealment. To cope with the Yan army's plunder, the masses have moved their grain and property to the old areas for safekeeping. The Yuchi Labor-Military Integration Committee is mobilizing and organizing the labor force of the entire county to support the front. The situation in Taigu has greatly changed since our army recovered Yangyi Town, and it is now fully engaged in harvesting.

    In the old areas of She and Lin counties, to prepare for the self-defense war, each county has also put forward the slogan of "Harvest Quickly" and "Fight Quickly." Both banks of the Qingzhang River in Shexian County are now harvesting intensely. Before the harvest, Nanhuang Village in Linxian County merged the original small groups into large groups to facilitate the adjustment of animal power. Most of the women and children have also been organized to carry out labor exchange. Taicang Village in Shexian County has set standard wages for both men and women, implementing a strict division of labor where men carry wheat, women cut and thresh, and children transport, and it is expected that the entire harvest will be completed within half a month.
