Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Paris dispatch: Today, twenty million French voters are holding the second election for the Constituent Assembly since the war. In the first Constituent Assembly, elected last October, the French Communist Party won the position of the largest party in the assembly. Due to the conspiracies of French reactionaries and the influence of foreign interference, the new constitution drafted by the first Constituent Assembly was rejected by a slight majority of one million votes in the referendum on May 5th. Therefore, a new assembly must be elected to revise the new constitution. On the eve of this election, reactionary activities at home and abroad in France have become increasingly rampant. The US$1.3 billion loan from the United States to strengthen the right-wing forces in France was announced a few days ago. Li Hai, the former US ambassador to France (now the chief of staff of the US president), who has close ties with the French reactionaries and created the Darlan puppet regime in 1942 to oppose De Gaulle, who was resisting the war at that time, also arrived in Paris on the 29th of last month with Blum, the right-wing leader of the French Socialist Party. According to a Reuters dispatch on the 1st, the French Socialist Party has been vigorously publicizing Blum's success in borrowing money from the United States as campaign capital, while President Gouin (leader of the Socialist Party) has also abandoned his advocacy of a unicameral parliament and agreed to draft a bicameral constitution after being elected. Under the influence of foreign interference, many politicians who once betrayed France are "running around and engaging in activities to establish a right-wing coalition government after the election, without the participation of the Communist Party" (Reuters). Munich element Daladier, reactionary General Giraud, who was supported by the United States in 1942 to oppose De Gaulle and suffered a disastrous defeat, and Renault, who handed over the position of Prime Minister to Pétain at the moment of France's defeat, are also coming out to engage in campaign activities, attempting to strengthen the reactionary camp. According to reports from Reuters and the Associated Press: Most observers predict that the election results will probably not have drastic changes in the number of seats in the parliament, and the Communist Party may still be elected as the largest party in the parliament. "And most responsible political leaders refuse to establish a government that excludes the Communist Party, believing that this would prevent the government from gaining the support of most organized workers" (Reuters).

    法国大选投票
    观察家预测：法共可能仍居第一大党
    【新华社延安二日电】巴黎讯：今日法国两千万选民，举行其战后第二个立宪议会的选举。第一个立宪议会，于去年十月选出，法国共产党曾荣膺该议会之首席大党。由于法国反动派的阴谋活动，与外国干涉的影响，第一个立宪议会所制定之新宪法，于五月五日复决中，遭受一百万票稍多数之否决，因此必须选举新的议会，来重订新宪。此次大选前夕，法国内外反动活动益形嚣张，美国为加强法国右派力量之对法十三亿美元贷款，已于日前宣布。而与法国反动派有密切联系，并于一九四二年制造达尔朗傀儡政权，以对抗当时抗战的戴高乐之美前驻法大使李海（现任美总统之参谋长），亦于上月二十九日与法国社会党右派领袖勃鲁姆同时抵达巴黎。据路透社一日电称：法社会党已将勃鲁姆赴美借款之成功，当作竞选资本大肆宣传，而古恩总统（社会党领袖）则亦放弃其对一院制国会之主张，而同意于当选后起草两院制宪法。在外国干涉影响下，许多曾经出卖法国的政客，“奔走呼号，进行在选举后建立右派的联合政府，而不要共产党参加的活动”（路透社电）。而慕尼黑分子达拉第，一九四二年为美国的支持以对抗戴高乐而遭惨败的反动将军吉维德，以及在法国失败时刻将总理地位让给贝当的雷诺等政治僵尸，也都出来作竞选蠢动，企图加强反动阵营。据路透社与美联社的报导：大多数观察家预料此次大选结果，议会席位恐不会有激烈的变动，共产党仍可能被选为国会之第一大党。“而大多数负责的政治领袖，则拒绝建立排除共产党在外的政府，认为这样会使政府得不到大部分有组织工人的支持（路透社）。
