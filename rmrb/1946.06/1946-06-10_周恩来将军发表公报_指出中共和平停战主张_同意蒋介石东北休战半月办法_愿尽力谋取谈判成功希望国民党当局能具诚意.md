Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 6th: General Zhou Enlai issued a communiqué at 4:00 PM today, pointing out that the Chinese Communist Party advocates for an unconditional and genuine cessation of civil war, whether regarding conflicts in mainland China or in the Northeast. Due to the CCP's persistence, the wishes of the Chinese people, and General Marshall's efforts, Chairman Chiang ordered a fifteen-day halt to offensives in the Northeast to conduct negotiations on the following matters: (1) Detailed measures to end the conflict in the Northeast; (2) Agreed measures with time limits for the complete restoration of transportation in China; (3) Implementation without further delay of the February 25th agreement regarding the foundation for the demobilization, reorganization, and unification of the Chinese army. Although we are concerned about the brevity of this fifteen-day period and that the negotiations will inevitably involve political issues of the Northeast and even national scope, requiring more time, we still agree to this fifteen-day ceasefire in order not to abandon any opportunity to achieve peace, and are willing to make every effort to achieve successful negotiations. We hope that the Kuomintang side can show the utmost sincerity, so that all past agreements are implemented and the temporary ceasefire becomes a long-term ceasefire, permanently stopping offensives, to meet the demands of the Chinese people and the world's nations.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 7th: CCP comrades Zhou Enlai and Lu Dingyi arrived in Yan'an at 12:00 noon today after flying from Nanjing.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, June 7th: Teng Daiyuan, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Eighteenth Group Army, along with Fan Changjiang, Director of the Nanjing Branch of the New China News Agency, arrived in Qingjiang by plane from Nanjing at 12:00 on the 5th, and then went to the Central China Military Region to discuss important matters. The official business concluded at 8:00 AM yesterday (the 6th), and they returned to Nanjing on the same plane.

    指出中共和平停战主张
    同意蒋介石东北休战半月办法
    愿尽力谋取谈判成功希望国民党当局能具诚意
    【新华社南京六日电】周恩来将军，今日下午四时发表公报，指出不论对于中国本部的冲突，或者对于东北的冲突，中国共产党都是主张无条件而且真正的停止内战的。由于中共的坚持，中国人民的愿望，和马歇尔将军的努力，才得蒋委员长下令制止在东北进攻十五天，进行下列事项的谈判：（一）结束东北冲突之详细办法；（二）完全恢复中国交通之含有时间限制的议定办法；（三）不再迟延地执行二月二十五日关于中国军队复员、整编、及统绸的协定之基础。我们虽然担心这十五天时间的短促，且谈判中又必然要牵连到东北乃至全国性的政治问题，需要更多时间；但我们为不放弃任何机会，以求和平之实现，故仍同意这一休战十五天的办法，并愿尽一切努力，谋取谈判成功。我们希望国民党方面，能具最大诚意，使过去一切协议见诸实施，并使暂时休战为长期休战，永远停止进攻，以符合中国人民及世界及邦之要求。
