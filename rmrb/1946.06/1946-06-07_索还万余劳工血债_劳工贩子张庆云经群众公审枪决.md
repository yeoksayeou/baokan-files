    Recovering the Blood Debt of Over Ten Thousand Laborers
    Labor Trafficker Zhang Qingyun Publicly Tried and Executed by the Masses
    [Our Newspaper, Xingtai News] On the 20th of this month, more than two thousand people in the Second District of Xingtai City held a mass meeting to publicly try the extremely heinous traitor Zhang Qingyun. This traitor was previously the chairman of the puppet Labor Association, specializing in capturing laborers and selling them to the puppet Manchuria. The years 1943 and 1944 were the most疯狂. According to incomplete statistics, Zhang Qingyun captured and sold more than 10,000 laborers. At the meeting, many people tearfully accused him of his crimes. Li Qiubao's cousin was captured and sold by Zhang Qingyun, leaving his whole family unable to survive and crying all day long. Cao Mengshi's husband was captured and sold, forcing her to beg from door to door. Xu Shi's aunt was angered to death because her son was sold and her money and belongings were also robbed by Zhang Qingyun. Chen Meini even sold her ten-year-old child, hoping to buy back her husband from Zhang Qingyun, but she wasted her money and did not get her husband back. Many of the laborers who were sold had already died unjustly on the road or in puppet Manchuria. According to Yang Zhengian, who escaped from puppet Manchuria, more than one hundred laborers who went with him had only twenty survivors. Wu Mandu accused: of the twenty-six laborers who lived with him, twenty died of illness, four were crushed to death in the kiln, and the remaining two were also crippled and begged for a living. Cao Mengshi's husband, unable to endure the prisoner-like life of eating only one catty of 玉茭 every day and suffering from cold and hunger, died after escaping. At the meeting, the masses shouted in extreme anger, demanding their fathers, sons, brothers, husbands, etc., from Zhang Qingyun, and Li Qiubao wanted to fight Zhang Qingyun to the death. Finally, the masses unanimously demanded that he pay with his life. The government accepted the demands of the masses and immediately executed him by firing squad according to law.
