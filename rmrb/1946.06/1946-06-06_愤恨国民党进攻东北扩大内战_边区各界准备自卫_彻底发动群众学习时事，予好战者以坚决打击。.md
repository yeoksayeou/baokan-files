[Reported by this newspaper] Indignant at the Kuomintang's Attack on Northeast, Expanding the Civil War; Border Region Communities Prepare for Self-Defense; Thoroughly Mobilize the Masses to Study Current Events, Resolutely Strike at Warmongers.

[This newspaper reports] Cadres and masses throughout the entire Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region, in light of the fact that after the Northeast Democratic Allied Army voluntarily ceded Changchun in order to strive for peace, the Kuomintang still insisted on attacking the Northeast and expanding the civil war to the entire country, and continuously attacked around the border region, arranging to seize wheat, creating a serious situation, have therefore held meetings one after another, opposing the civil war, and carrying out mobilization, preparing for self-defense, and resolutely striking at warmongering elements. The cadres and miscellaneous personnel of the Handan County government, in a current affairs discussion meeting, universally reflected on their feelings of paralysis and pleasure-seeking, further clarified the essence of the reactionaries, and unanimously recognized that only by resolutely defending themselves can they achieve peace. Correspondent Pei Qingfa said: "If the Kuomintang reactionaries dare to attack us, I will go to the front line and beat them back!" The joint meeting of teachers and staff of all primary schools in Linqing City, after discussing the current situation, decided to conduct extensive propaganda, consolidate the ideological front, and formulated specific propaganda points and methods. When all the administrative cadres of Wucheng County were discussing the domestic situation, Deputy County Chief Qi called on all cadres to mobilize, launch mass anti-special agent work, and actively prepare for self-defense. The current affairs forum of more than 300 cultural and educational cadres in Yuanqu County clearly recognized the Kuomintang reactionaries' determination to wage a civil war and unanimously believed that they must be ideologically and actively mobilized, thoroughly mobilize the masses, consolidate the river defense, and protect the summer harvest. Teachers, students, and staff of the Qinyuan County Senior Normal School held a general meeting to discuss the current situation. After the meeting, they compiled the main points of the current situation into dramas and performed them in various villages to conduct anti-civil war propaganda. When the masses in Zhou Village, Jincheng, heard that the Kuomintang was attacking northern and eastern Henan, all the peasants expressed their firm opposition. Militiamen and members of the farmers' association launched heated discussions in night schools, and the militiamen immediately began intensive training, carefully preparing for self-defense. After the 300 masses in Lutai Village, Weixian County, listened to the farmers' association's report on the current situation, they immediately broke into groups for discussion. Wang Changfa, a member of the farmers' association, said: "What Old Jiang says doesn't count for much, he's rotten to the core, just like the feudal forces in our village, he has to bow his head." In the joint discussion of the three production mutual aid groups, everyone was full of confidence in victory. Someone said after recalling the victory of the Pinghan Campaign: "With Commander Liu in command, and the Eighth Route Army fighting in front, and our people helping in the back, we will definitely be able to repel the reactionaries' invasion." The next day, the team leaders' meeting made a decision, calling on all the villagers to do the following work: 1. Strengthen the unity of the masses with the cadres, internally, and among each other. 2. Improve and enhance production mutual aid. 3. Mobilize the masses to prevent special agents. 4. Implement the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of soldiers and war dead. 5. Strengthen the current affairs education of the villagers, with primary school teachers broadcasting news to the masses every night.
