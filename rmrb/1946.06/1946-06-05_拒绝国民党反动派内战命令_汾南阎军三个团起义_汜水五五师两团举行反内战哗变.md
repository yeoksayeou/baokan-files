    Refusing the Kuomintang Reactionaries' Order for Civil War
    Three Regiments of Yan's Army in Southern Shanxi Uprising
    Two Regiments of the 55th Division in Sishui Stage Anti-Civil War Mutiny
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Handan, 3rd] In May, the anti-civil war movement developed rapidly in many units of the Kuomintang army. In the 27th Army's 49th Division stationed in Kangcun and Xuying, Wuzhi, more than 2,000 lower-ranking officers and soldiers deserted in May due to their opposition to the civil war. More than 800 deserted from the 196th Brigade stationed in Fencheng and Xiangling. Two regiments of the 55th Division of the 38th Army staged an anti-civil war mutiny in the Sishui area. According to reliable information, a very small number of soldiers from these two regiments who were captured by the Kuomintang army confessed: "We realized the error of suppressing the Communists too late, so we moved one step behind." In the Southern Shanxi area, three regiments of Yan's army, led by Lei Wenqing, staged an anti-civil war uprising because they refused the Kuomintang fascists' order for civil war. They were attacked by both the Kuomintang army and Yan's army. Lei Wenqing led his troops to transfer to the Ronghe and Jishan liberated areas in mid-May to continue opposing the civil war.
