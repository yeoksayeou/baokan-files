Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: Wenzhou News: The people of southern Zhejiang, plagued by natural disasters and man-made calamities, are starving, and there are waves of rice shop seizures and "banditry" everywhere. Soldiers, students, and teachers are also rising up in resistance. From Lishui to Wenzhou, a rat plague is raging, attacking hundreds of thousands of city residents, and the wheat in the fields is suffering from black spike disease. Newly transplanted rice paddies have already revealed locust eggs, raising concerns about the harvest. These are natural disasters, but man-made calamities are even more significant. Political darkness, exorbitant taxes, and skyrocketing prices are like poisonous snakes, biting every person in southern Zhejiang, arousing resistance from the lower classes. Following the seizure of rice shops in Wenzhou, rice shops in Lishui, Ruian, Pingyang, Chumen, and Yueqing have also been attacked. Following the "Big Sword Society's" resistance to grain and corvée labor movement in Pingyang and surrounding areas in the winter of 1933 (which was bloodily suppressed), six forms of so-called "banditry" have now widely emerged in southern Zhejiang, prevalent in Lishui, Qingtian, Taishun, Pingyang, Ruian, Wenzhou, and other places. The first type is Kuomintang soldiers who have deserted or mutinied. Recently, in the Pucheng area (northern Fujian), a "genuine" Kuomintang army mutinied. They scattered to various places, asking for nothing but a little "travel money" to go home. They recently injured several security guards escorting a certain commissioner upstream of the Zhen River. The second type is "sea bandits." "Bandit ships" have been found intercepting cargo ships in various locations of the Zhen River and Ao River. The third type is so-called "Mao Cuo," with more cases of highway robbery, common in Yongjia, Lishui, and other places. The fourth type is "Lang Li Fei" and "water bandits," lying in ambush at river and harbor intersections, suddenly robbing ships passing by at night. They have been found in Pingyang, Yonggu, and other places. The fifth type is "kidnappers," scattered throughout various counties and districts, and near wealthy townships. The sixth type is remnants of the "Big Sword Society," scattered between Pingyang and Taishun, and on the border of Zhejiang and Fujian. In addition, hungry students and teachers have also risen up in resistance. Students at Wenzhou Normal School in Ruian, in order to resist the school authorities' embezzlement of public grain, burned down the dining hall, and are still on strike. Hungry teachers in Pingyang, Yueqing, and Ruian counties have all staged collective strikes and petitions. On May 5th, elementary school teachers in Yongjia organized the "Urban Elementary School Teachers Union" and conducted a full-scale strike on the 13th. They issued a declaration, denouncing the authorities for violating Chiang Kai-shek's promise to improve teachers'待遇 before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, saying: "Laws and decrees are equivalent to waste paper, and how can painted cakes satisfy hunger?"

　　天灾人祸民不聊生
    浙南饥民到处打米店
    士兵哗变饥饿教员学生纷起抗争
    【新华社延安十九日电】温州讯：在天灾人祸交迫下的浙南人民饿荒了，到处有打米店风潮“匪患”蜂窝。士兵学生教员亦纷起反抗。从丽水到温州，鼠疫猛袭数十万城市居民，田里麦子患了黑穗病。刚插好的秧田，已发现蝗卵，收获可忧。这是天灾，但人祸是更主要的。政治黑暗，横征暴敛，物价狂涨像毒蛇，每一个浙南人民都被它咬着了，激起下层人民的反抗。自温州打米店后，丽水、瑞安、平阳、楚门、乐清的米店也同样被打了。继三十三年冬，平阳一带“大刀会”的抗粮抗役运动（曾被血腥压平）之后，浙南现又广泛出现了六种形式的所谓“匪患”，普遍于丽水、青田、泰顺、平阳、瑞安、温州等各地。第一种是逃散和哗变的国民党军。最近蒲城（闽北）一带，“正牌”的国民党军，发生了兵变。他们散至各地，不要别的，只要一点“盘费”回家。他们在甄江上游，最近就打伤了数名护送某专员的保安队员。第二种是“海贼”。甄江、鳌江各处，均发现“匪船”截击货船的事。第三种是所谓“毛锉”，发现更多拦路行劫的，永嘉、丽水等地，比比皆是。第四种是“浪里飞”“水匪”们，埋伏河港交叉，宵夜航船经过，即突起抢劫。平阳、永古等地，均已发现。第五种是“绑匪”，散布于各县区，及殷实乡镇毗近。第六种是“大刀会”余系，散布于平阳、泰顺绑间，及浙闽边境。此外为饥饿的学生教员，也纷起抗争。在瑞安的温州师范学生，为了反抗学校当局吞没公粮，一把火把膳堂烧光了，现在还在罢课。平阳、乐清、瑞安各县，饥饿的教员均曾集体罢教与请愿。五月五日永嘉小学教师，组织了“城区小学教师联合会”，于十三日进行全体罢教。他们发表宣言，指斥当局自己违背抗战胜利前蒋介石说将改善教师待遇的诺言。说：“法令既等同废纸，画饼更何能充饥。”
