Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Shanghai newspapers reported that the renowned economist Mr. Ma Yinchu, at a symposium held at Xingwu Hall last month on the 17th, delivered a speech to over a hundred people, including factory directors, managers, engineers from the industrial and commercial sectors, as well as individuals from the education, cultural, and journalistic fields. He sternly criticized the new Company Law promulgated by the Kuomintang authorities, stating: "The true fate of China's economy has indeed reached a very dangerous point! Our economic lifeline and the people's livelihood are completely seized by the Americans!" He pointed out that according to Articles 7 and 192 of the law, foreign companies establishing branches in China are not required to operate in their home countries. This allows foreign companies to be completely tax-exempt in their home countries and to underreport capital in their Chinese branches to evade taxes. Foreign companies, with their abundant capital, advanced technology, and sophisticated management methods, coupled with tax exemptions and evasion, render Chinese companies unable to compete. China's national capital will be devastated! Furthermore, bureaucratic capital will further collude with foreign capital to manipulate the Chinese economy. Mr. Ma believes that this "is simply an American trade law," and "China's economy is equivalent to being surrendered to the United States!" He further recounted how, this spring, in his capacity as a legislator, he opposed the draft law in the Legislative Yuan, advocating for a strong defense of the "operation" restriction (it was approved by the Legislative Yuan at the time, and efforts were made to argue for it to the Supreme National Defense Council). He also stated that a certain "bigwig" in the National Defense Council did not approve of it, and it was opposed by Xu Kan, ultimately leading to its rejection. Mr. Ma vehemently condemned bureaucratic capital for such "extremely reactionary and shameless collusion with foreign capital, sacrificing national interests and disregarding the people!" Mr. Ma expressed hope that as China and the United States are about to sign a commercial treaty, the authorities must not make provisions like those in the new Company Law again; otherwise, it will make China's economy a dependency of the United States. Finally, Mr. Ma stated: "If this problem is not resolved, there is no way to solve the economic problem." He used a Chinese proverb: "Three brothers and four brothers with one heart, the mud in front of the door turns to gold; three brothers and four brothers with two hearts, the gold in front of the door turns to dust," to illustrate that China's poverty and financial exhaustion are the result of the Kuomintang reactionaries' pursuit of civil war. At the same time, he called on industrialists across the country to organize and "stand up and speak out," to save China's economic fate from danger.

    马寅初氏发表演说：
    我们经济命脉与人民生活，完全给美国人抓去了！
    【新华社延安十三日电】沪报载名经济学家马寅初氏，于上月十七日在星五座谈会，向工商界厂长、经理、工程师及教育文化界人士、新闻记者百余人，发表讲演，严正抨击国民党当局公布的新公司法，认为：“中国经济的真正命运，实在已经到了很危险的程度！我们经济的命脉与人民的生活，完全给美国人抓去了！”指出依该法第七第一九二条的规定，外国公司在中国设分公司者，其本国之公司可不营业，则外国公司在本国可完全免税，其在中国分公司亦可少报资本以逃税。外国公司资本雄厚，技术进步，管理方法精良，又可免税逃税，则中国公司绝不足与之竞争。中国民族资本，将被摧残！而官僚资本，将更进一步与外国资本勾结操纵中国经济。马氏认为这“简直是美国的贸易法”，“中国经济等于亡给了美国”！继述及渠今春以立法委员资格，在立法院反对该法草案，提议力争“营业”二字的限制（按当时曾获得立法院通过，而向国防最高委员会力争）。并谓国防会某“大老”不赞成，并被徐堪所反对，卒为否定。马氏痛责官僚资本如此“极端反动的和外国资本无耻的勾结起来，不惜牺牲民族利益，置人民于度外”！马氏希望现值中美将签订商约之时、当局万不可再作与新公司法那样规定；否则将使中国经济，成为美国附庸。最后马氏称：“此问题不解决，经济问题，是没有办法的”。并以中国民谚：“三兄四弟一条心，门前泥土变黄金，三兄四弟两条心，门前黄金变灰尘”。说明中国民穷财尽，是国民党反动派进行内战的结果。同时呼吁全国工业家组织起来“挺身出来讲话”，力挽中国经济命运之危亡。
