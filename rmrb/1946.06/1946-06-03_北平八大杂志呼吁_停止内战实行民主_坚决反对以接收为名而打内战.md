Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th. Peiping News: Eight major magazines in Peiping, including "Pingshi Compilation," "News Review," "New Star Pictorial," "People's Words Weekly," "People's Literature and Art," and "Democracy Weekly," have jointly issued a declaration calling for an immediate end to the civil war and the implementation of democracy. The declaration stated: "If the civil war is not completely stopped for even a day, we will not stop calling for opposition to the civil war. This is the only way for the Chinese people to survive, and we must persist to the end and never give up until our goal is achieved!" The declaration demands: (1) Immediately and unconditionally stop the civil war; (2) Resolve all issues through political means; (3) Immediately implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference; (4) Replace generals and officials who insist on civil war; (5) Eradicate secret agents.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th. Peiping "News Review," issue number twelve, published an article entitled "Who is Delaying? Who is Breaking Faith?" in its editorial section, listing the facts of the Kuomintang authorities violating the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. It then pointed out that "If the civil war in the Northeast is not stopped, it will inevitably sweep across the country; if the situation in the Northeast is not stable, it will inevitably disturb the whole world." But how to solve the Northeast problem? The publication believes that "there is only one way: peaceful negotiation," because "national political issues need to be negotiated... the Northeast cannot be exceptional." What the Kuomintang insists on is that the government has the right to send troops to take over the Northeast, "The government only has the sovereignty to take over the nine northeastern provinces and carry out national administrative power," denying the democratically elected government in the Northeast, etc. "But from the perspective of us ordinary people, acceptance should not become the banner of civil war. We resolutely oppose fighting a civil war in the name of taking over."

    北平八大杂志呼吁
    停止内战实行民主
    坚决反对以接收为名而打内战
    【新华社延安三十日电】北平讯：平市集纳社、新闻评论、新星画报、人言周刊、人民文艺、民主周刊等八大杂志，为呼吁迅即停止内战，实行民主，近特联合发表宣言称：内战一时不彻底停止，我们一天不停止反对内战的呼吁。这是中国人民的唯一生路，一定要坚持到底，不达目的誓不罢休！宣言要求：（一）立即无条件停止内战；（二）一切问题用政治方式解决；（三）立即实行政协决议；（四）撤换坚持内战的将领和官吏；（五）根绝特务。
    【新华社延安廿九日电】北平新闻评论第十二期在社论地位刊载：“谁在推延？谁在背信？”一文，历数国民党当局违背政协决议的事实，继而指出“东北内战不制止，必然席卷全国；东北局面若不安定，必然会扰动全世界”。但东北问题如何解决呢？该刊认为“只有和平协商之一途”，因为“全国政治问题要协商，……东北也不能特殊化”。而国民党所坚持的，是政府有权进兵接收东北，“政府对于东北九省，只有接收主权，进行国家行政权力”，否认东北民选政府等等。“但从我们老百姓的立场说来，接受不该成为内战的旗帜，以接收为名而打内战，是我们坚决反对的”。
