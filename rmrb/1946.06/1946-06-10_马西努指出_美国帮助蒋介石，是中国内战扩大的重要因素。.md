Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. Commentator Masinu, in a Moscow radio broadcast on the 6th, cited reports and commentaries from Chinese and foreign newspapers, pointing out that the Chinese civil war is continuing to expand. The Kuomintang authorities are mobilizing all their troops to prepare for an expansion of the civil war. Certain Kuomintang figures have stated that they do not want peace, and have exposed the reasons for the expansion of the civil war, which is that the Kuomintang reactionaries are taking advantage of the current situation in China and abroad to carry out "bandit suppression" in order to eliminate all democratic forces in China and restore the reactionary rule of the pre-war period. The United States' aid to Chiang Kai-shek is an important factor in the expansion of the civil war. Luo Longji, a leader of the Democratic League, said in a conversation that the failure to restore peace in China was due to the United States guaranteeing Chiang Kai-shek continued war materiel. If the United States continues to assist Chiang, he will continue the war. If the United States does not change its current policy, peace cannot be established in China at any time. Many foreign journalists recently reported from China: On December 20th of last year, U.S. military commander in China Wedemeyer and special envoy Marshall, one hour after arriving in Shanghai, U.S. military commander in China Wedemeyer broadcast a statement: American ships have stopped going to the United States because President Truman's policy is for the U.S. military to continue to be stationed in China. An Associated Press reporter in Shanghai reported: Wedemeyer stated not long ago that the U.S. troops stationed in China were expected to completely withdraw from China in the spring and summer of 1946, but this is now impossible. The Shanghai Libao's Nanjing reporter reported on December 22nd of last year: Marshall stated that he firmly advocated that the U.S. military would only be able to withdraw from China after a very long period of time. London Radio: Wedemeyer had received orders from the U.S. State Department to help transport Kuomintang troops to Manchuria. The U.S. Post also pointed out this fact at the time, and said: The declaration of non-interference in China's internal affairs is not a matter of principle, but of practical action. Although Truman issued a so-called declaration that the United States would not interfere in China's civil war, in reality it was the United States that was providing military assistance to Chiang Kai-shek. An Associated Press reporter pointed out that the U.S. military continued to help Chiang Kai-shek in an attempt to expand its own influence into Manchuria in order to create a China that would not only be pro-American, but also dependent on the United States in all aspects. The reporter continued: The U.S. Marines did not actually disarm the Japanese troops in North China and send them back to their country, in order to use the Japanese troops to assist the Kuomintang army, because the Kuomintang government would not be able to occupy North China without the help of the Japanese puppet troops. Therefore, the United States delayed the implementation of this task. Later facts further proved that the United States' assistance to the Kuomintang fueled the development of the Chinese civil war.

    马西努指出
    美国帮助蒋介石，是中国内战扩大的重要因素。
    【新华社延安七日电】莫斯科六日广播评论员马西努，引用中外报纸的报导及评论，指出中国内战在继续扩大，国民党当局征调所有部队，准备扩大内战，国民党某些人士称，不要和平，并揭发内战扩大原因，是由于国民党反动派利用当前中国国内外形势，进行剿共，以至消灭全中国的民主力量，恢复战前的反动统治。而美国帮助蒋介石，是内战扩大的重要因素。民主同盟领袖罗隆基在谈话中，认为在中国恢复和平事业失败是由于美国保证蒋介石继续战斗的物资，美国继续蒋帮助，他即将继续战争，如果美国不改变现行政策，在中国任何时候，都不能树立和平。许多外国记者，不久前自中国报导：去年十二月二十日，驻华美军司令魏特梅耶、特使马歇尔，在到上海一小时后，驻华美军司令魏特梅耶即广播声明：美国轮船停止开往美国，因为杜鲁门总统的政策，要美军继续驻在中国。美联社上海记者报导：魏特梅耶声明不久前，美驻华军队约许在一九四六年春夏季时，从中国完全撤退，可是这已是不可能了。上海立报南京记者去年十二月二十二日报导：马歇尔声明，坚决主张美军经过很长时期之后，才能从中国撤退。伦敦广播：魏特梅耶曾接获美国国务院命令，帮助运送国民党军队赴满洲。美国邮报当时亦指出这一事实，并称：不干涉中国内政的声明，不在于原则上，而在于实际行动。杜鲁门虽发表所谓美国不干涉中国内战的声明，而实际上正是美国在军事上帮助了蒋介石。美联社记者指出美军继续帮助蒋介石，企图把自已的势力扩展到满洲，以便造成这样一个中国：她将不仅是亲美的，而且在各方面依赖美国，该记者继称：美海军陆战队，实际上没有解除华北日军武装及遣送回国，以便利用日军援助国民党军，因为国民党政府如果没有日伪军的帮助，就不能占领华北。因此，美国迁延了这一任务的实行。后来的事实，更证明了美国对于国民党的帮助，助长了中国内战的发展。
