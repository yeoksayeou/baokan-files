Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Copenhagen dispatch: A US military delegation arrived in Copenhagen from Greenland to negotiate with Danish authorities regarding the issue of bases on the Danish island. The island's Governor, Simoni, also accompanied the Americans to discuss the Greenland issue with the administrative authorities. Simoni declared, "The United States does not want to abandon its bases." This move has aroused opposition from Denmark. The People's Garden newspaper stated, "The Governor's trip naturally makes one ask whether the Danish government truly wishes to grant military privileges to one of the United Nations, privileges that are incompatible with Denmark's sovereignty over Greenland."

The *Berlingske Aftenavis* also commented: The US Navy has already conducted exercises in the waters west of Greenland and plans to conduct similar exercises in the northeast sea of Greenland. Therefore, various rumors surrounding the arrival of the US military delegation in Copenhagen are quite natural.

    美国图占有丹属格林兰
    【新华社延安二日电】哥本哈根讯：美军事代表团由格林兰抵哥本哈根，与丹麦当局谈判丹麦海岛上之基地问题。该岛总督西莫尼亦陪同美人抵此，与行政当局商讨格林兰问题。西莫尼声称：“美国不欲放弃其基地”。此举已引起丹麦的反对。人民园地报称：“总督此行很自然的使人要问，丹麦政府是否真愿给予联合国之一国以军事特权，而此种特权与丹麦在格林兰之主权两不相容。”
    《柏林斯基阿富纳维斯》报亦评称：美海军已在格林兰西部海中举行演习，并计划在格林兰东北海中，举行同样演习，故对美军事代表团到达哥本哈根事有各种谣言，亦颇自然。
