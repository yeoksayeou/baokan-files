　　Small Factories in Changzhi City

　　The number of small factories built in Changzhi City in just half a year has exceeded three and a half times the number during the enemy's rule.

　　When the enemy was in Changzhi, they occupied seven factories, including an ordnance factory, an automobile company, an electric light company, a water company, an electric flour mill, a printing factory, and a paper mill, forcing a total of 436 people to work.

　　After liberation, the democratic government reduced the 300-person ordnance factory to a 59-person repair factory, repairing tools for the people. The electric light company, after private investment of 40 million yuan for its purchase, continued to expand its business, increasing from 35 workers to 55. The remaining five factories also continued to expand. Among the 24 newly added factories, eight were private, one was jointly owned by public and private entities, and fifteen were publicly owned. In terms of business: 17 textile factories, and the remainder were printing factories, oilcloth factories, chemical factories, leather factories, garment factories, repair factories, and pottery factories. The city had a total of 31 factories, employing 748 workers.

　　Last October, after the democratic government relieved the workers in Changzhi, the city's trade union convened them to discuss wages and organize the resumption of work. After their lives stabilized, they launched an anti-traitor liquidation movement, six large joint struggles, and ten individual liquidations, involving the vast majority of citizens in the movement, dividing up more than four million yuan in spoils from the struggle, shattering the shackles imposed on them by six major traitors, and a new labor-capital relationship was born. They had a common goal: cooperation, mutual assistance, mutual benefit, and jointly building factories.

　　The publicly-owned paper mill initially agreed to a "four-six profit sharing" system with the workers. As a result, the factory made no profit. The workers realized that this was due to setting wages too high, so they came up with two solutions: reducing wages and increasing production, working together with the factory to seek the factory's development. The water company needed to ensure water supply for the citizens, so to start the machines, the number of workers needed to be increased from eighteen to twenty-four. The workers automatically made a disc mill to make distiller's yeast, earning 90,000 yuan per month. They also automatically organized themselves to reclaim 20 mu of wasteland in the factory to grow vegetables, improving their lives and enabling the factory to earn money. The 23 workers in the privately-owned chemical factory organized a production competition themselves, increasing production by 34 percent, eventually increasing it to 50 percent, earning a bonus of 250,000 yuan. The workers' enthusiasm for labor pushed production forward, and in mid-May they expanded the scope of production to manufacture toothbrushes and toothpaste.

　　The upsurge of labor-capital cooperation in building factories is unfolding in every factory. Workers at the Huaxing Textile Factory, seeing that towels were not selling, immediately switched to weaving timely willow-patterned cloth, which quickly sold out. The Yihecheng Factory, jointly operated by public and private entities, switched from weaving towels to weaving vests, which allowed the factory with a capital of 400,000 yuan to develop to more than 2 million yuan. The manager of a peasant cooperative said to a trade union comrade: "When a worker weaved six dozen socks in one day, I thought he was crazy. It turned out that he had returned from a production meeting at the trade union and was working desperately!"

　　长治市的小型工厂
    长治市在短短半年里建设起来的小型工厂已超过敌人统治时期的三倍半。
    敌人在长治时，占有的工厂，有军火工厂、汽车公司、电灯公司、自来水公司、电力磨面厂，印刷厂、造纸厂等七个，被迫作工的共四百卅六人。
    解放后民主政府把三百人的军火工厂缩编为五十九人的修理工厂，为人民修理用具。电灯公司经私人出资四千万元收买后，继续扩大营业，由三十五个工人增加到五十五个。其余五个工厂也一样在继续扩大中。新增的二十四家工厂中，有私人工厂八家，公私合办一家，公营十五家。就其业务来说：纺织厂十七家，其余为印刷厂、油布厂、化学厂、皮革厂、成衣厂、修理厂、缸窑厂，全市共有工厂三十一家，容纳工人七百四十八个。
    去年十月民主政府在救济长治工人之后，市工会就召集他们评议工资，组织复工。生活稳定后曾开展反奸清算运动，六个大联合斗争和十个单独清算，把广大市民也卷入运动，分得四百多万元的斗争果实、粉碎了六个大汉奸给予他们的枷锁，新的劳资关系产生了。他们有一个共同目标：合作、互助、互利，共同建设工厂。
    公营纸厂，最初和工人订立工四厂六分红制，实行结果，厂方无利，工人检讨出来这是由于订工资过高，于是想了两个办法；减资和增产，与厂方共同努力求得工厂的发展。自来水公司要保证市民用水，开动机器，十八个工人需增加到二十四个，工人们自动的按了一盘立磨作酒曲，每月收入九万元。又自动组织起来把厂内二十亩荒地开过来种上菜，生活改善了，厂家也能赚上钱。私营化学工厂的二十三个工人自己组织了生产竞赛，产量增加百分之三十四，最后增加到百分之五十、挣了二十五万元红利，工人的劳动热情把生产推向前进，在五月中又扩大生产范围，制造牙刷牙粉。
    劳资合作建设工厂的热潮，在每一个工厂里开展着，华兴纺织厂的工人看到毛巾推不出去，马上改织应时的柳条布，很快就卖光了。公私合办的义合成工厂，不织毛巾织背心，这样一来，使四十万资金的工厂发展到二百多万了。农民合作社经理向工会同志说：“一天工人织了六打袜子，我当他发疯了，原来是他到工会开了生产会才回来拚命干啦！”
