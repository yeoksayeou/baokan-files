    [This News Report] According to reports from correspondents in seven counties including Changzhi in Taihang, a current obstacle to the production movement in both new and old areas is the improper handling of the fruits of the mass movement struggle, which affects the smooth development of the production movement. In Dongping Village, Fifth District of Changzhi, since the mass movement shifted to production, the masses' enthusiasm for production has been low because the fruits of the struggle have not been distributed. Clothing, grain, and other items are stored in the village office, but many difficulties in the masses' production cannot be resolved. Some cadres and activists misused these items, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. After the problem was discovered, the distribution was quickly and thoroughly carried out, and the cadres also made self-criticisms. The relationship between the masses and the cadres became closer, and the production movement quickly developed. In Dongliangjia Village, Gaoyi, when distributing the fruits of the struggle, the cadres received more, and fourteen impoverished households received nothing. After that, the mass movement stagnated, and people were reluctant to speak at reasoning sessions. They felt that they had offended the landlords and gained nothing, and were disappointed with the struggle. Jixian recently discovered during rent reduction that the fruits of the struggle from the winter before last had not been distributed to this day, causing dissatisfaction among the masses, who suspected the cadres of corruption. After recent handling of the situation, the masses and cadres united to engage in production. In Tuling Village, Third District of Wu'an, rent reduction was relatively thorough, but production was not enthusiastic. An investigation revealed that the cadres had received too many of the fruits of the struggle. After self-criticism and redistribution, production quickly picked up. The current mass movement in the Chengguan District of Wu'an is stagnant. After examination, it was found that the distribution of the fruits of the struggle was problematic. For example, in the 17th and 18th streets, without mass discussion, the cadres used the fruits of the struggle to establish four cooperatives. Moreover, there were problems with the share calculation. Each cadre had two shares (each share worth one thousand yuan), militiamen had one and a half shares, and poor members had one share, causing dissatisfaction among the masses, who were not concerned about the cooperatives. In places where the situation has been handled well, the masses and cadres are united, and enthusiasm for production is high. For example, the distribution of the fruits of the struggle in × Street, Xingtai, was conducted after democratic discussion and distributed to the masses. Then, they called for organizing production, and the masses voluntarily purchased shares to set up cooperatives, showing great concern for the cooperatives. In Dongfengnian, Xiyang, the distribution of the fruits was entirely based on democratic discussion, proposing the slogan "Everyone cooks, everyone eats," taking care of all poor households. The masses' enthusiasm is very high. In Xiaqizhi Village, Eighth District of Zuoquan, the distribution of the fruits of the struggle was appropriate, and education on rent reduction, liberation, and production for prosperity was conducted. The masses' enthusiasm for production is very high. The number of mutual aid households accounts for 87% of the entire village, and women are also organized, preparing to buy weaving machines with 5,500 yuan from the struggle funds to develop textile production. In Dengyu Village, Yushe, after the mass movement, 82 households recovered a total of more than 480,000 yuan of their hard-earned fruits, 71 mu of land, and more than 100 dan of grain. Everyone said, "Let's use our hard-earned money for production and prosperity to plug the holes of poverty." The whole village has now organized six labor teams, and the enthusiasm for production is very high.
    The Taihang Xinhua Daily, based on this situation, published an editorial pointing out that the fruits of the struggle should be distributed reasonably and quickly. When handling the situation, special attention should be paid to clarifying the cadres' thinking, further enhancing their awareness, and automatically admitting mistakes and re-distributing the fruits reasonably. On the masses' side, they should comprehensively recognize the merits and demerits of the cadres and offer well-intentioned criticism to achieve the goal of uniting for production.

    太行合理分配斗争果实后
    干部群众团结生产
    【本报讯】根据太行长治等七县通讯员报导，当前新老区生产运动上的一个障碍，是处置群运斗争果实不恰当问题，影响了生产运动的顺畅开展。长治五区东平村，群众运动转向生产以来，群众生产情绪不高，原因是斗争果实没分配，衣物粮食等存在村公所，群众生产中许多困难却不能解决，有些干部和积极分子借上乱用，群众不满。问题发现后，迅速彻底分配，干部也作了检讨，群众干部关系密切了，生产运动很快有了开展。在高邑东良家庄分配斗争果实时，干部分的较多，有十四家赤贫户没有得到，此后群运表现停滞，说理会也不大发言，他们感到既得罪了地主也没得到东西，对斗争失望。汲县最近查减中，发现前年冬的斗争果实，拖到现在未分，群众不满，怀疑干部贪污，最近处理后，群众干部团结闹生产。武西三区土岭村，减租较彻底，生产不起劲，检查原因是干部多得了斗争果实。经检讨重新处理后，生产很快搞起来了。武安城关区当前群运表现停滞，检讨后发现斗争果实分配有问题，如十七、八街，未经群众讨论，干部即将斗争果实办了四个合作社，而且算股也有问题，干部每人两股（每股千元），民兵一股半，贫民会员一股，群众不满，也不关心合作社。在处理好的地方，群众干部团结，生产情绪高涨，如邢台×街斗争果实分配经过民主讨论，分到群众手里，然后号召组织生产，群众在自愿基础上入股办起合作社，对合作社表现十分关心。昔阳东丰稔果实分配完全采取民主讨论，提出“大家做饭大家吃”的口号，照顾到所有贫户，群众情绪很高，左权八区下其至村，斗争果实分配适当，并进行了减租翻身生产发家教育，群众生产劲头很大，参加互助户数占全村百分之八十七，妇女也组织起来，以斗争款五千五百元，准备买织布机开展纺织。榆社邓峪村群运后，八十二户共拿回血汗果实四十八万余元，七十一亩土地，百余石粮食，大家都说：“把咱血汗钱，用到生产发家上，堵住穷窟窿。”现全村已组织了六个拨工队，生产情绪很高。
    太行新华日报特依据此情况发表社论指出应迅速合理分配斗争果实，处理时，应特别注意打通干部思想，进一步提高干部觉悟，自动认错，重新合理分配果实，群众方面，应全面认识干部的功过，提出善意的批评，以达团结生产的目的。
