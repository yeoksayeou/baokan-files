　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: According to foreign news agencies in Nanjing on the 20th, Chief Representative of the CCP Delegation, Zhou Enlai, called for "an indefinite cessation of all wars inside China and in the Northeast, pending negotiated solutions." Simultaneously, Zhou directly rejected the Nationalist authorities' proposed plan that Marshall have the final say on Chinese affairs. He said: Any action by allied nations must be based on Truman's statement on China policy of December 15, 1945, and the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference Communiqué of the 27th of the same month. That communiqué stated: the US, the Soviet Union and the UK do not interfere in China's internal affairs. Zhou Enlai stated: The CCP opposes granting Marshall such final authority, believing that every issue must be resolved through agreement by all parties.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Moscow Radio: According to Indian Radio broadcast on June 18th, the Southeast Asia Committee of the China Democratic League, representing millions of Chinese in Southeast Asia, demanded that the American troops immediately withdraw from China and that the Nationalist Party not be given military aid.
