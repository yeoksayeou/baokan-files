Demobilized Soldiers Return Home in Glory
    Taihang and Southern Hebei Complete First Phase of Demobilization
    Kunming Unemployed Soldiers, Ragged and Destitute, Wander the Streets
    [This Newspaper, Handan, 10th Dispatch] The demobilization work in Taihang and Southern Hebei is continuing. The first phase of demobilization in Taihang was completed at the beginning of this month. A total of more than 770 people were demobilized from three sub-districts (excluding the third sub-district). The direct units of the × Brigade of the Southern Hebei Eighth Route Army Field Army also demobilized 107 people at the end of last month in accordance with the demobilization plan. Now these demobilized soldiers are leaving their units and returning to their hometowns. They are warmly welcomed by the masses in every town they pass through. On the 17th of last month, at a farewell meeting of more than 1,000 people in Zuoquan City, demobilized soldier Wang Jinzhong said with great emotion: "After we go back, we will never forget defending the border region. If the reactionaries dare to attack our liberated areas, we will immediately take up arms again and resolutely smash the pig heads of those invaders!" When they passed through the vast fields where the masses were harvesting wheat, the villagers put down their sickles and crowded around to send them off. An old man with a white beard said to the soldiers with great excitement: "If it weren't for our Eighth Route Army, would this year's bumper wheat harvest still belong to our people?" At the time of parting, the masses were reluctant to leave.
    [This Newspaper, Handan, 11th Dispatch] According to Kuang Decheng, a major attached to the regimental headquarters of the Nationalist Army's 1st Armored Regiment, who recently came to the Liberated Area from Kunming, the situation of the Kuomintang's treatment of unemployed officers is as follows: Besides the units sent into the Chongqing Demobilized Officers' General Team in batches, it is really difficult to enter the team individually. The team, from the captain-general to the personnel section chief, openly asks for money. The price for the "entrance fee" to the team is 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. If you pay the money, even if you are not an officer, you can enter the team at any time; otherwise, even officers who have contributed to the War of Resistance cannot enter. A company commander named Chen Hui, who participated in all the major battles during the War of Resistance and had many first and second-class wounds on his body, had a whole briefcase full of certificates of honor, but because he had no money and no connections, he registered five times in a row and was not approved. He had to return to Guizhou with grief and tears to find another way. A deputy regimental commander named Zhang saw a soldier who used to be under his command spend money and get a company commander's title in the team when he went to register, but he could not get the right to register even after begging repeatedly. Shanggao Courtyard is full of unemployed officers waiting to register. They sold all their quilts and clothes but could not get any sympathy. Finally, Major Kuang Decheng said with infinite indignation: In the streets of Chongqing and Kunming, you can see generals' wives riding around in cars everywhere, but you can also see unemployed officers in rags everywhere. They frown and wander the streets.

    复员军人荣归故里
    太行冀南完成第一期复员
    昆明失业军人衣衫褴褛踯躅街头
    【本报邯郸十日讯】太行冀南复员工作，正继续进行。太行第一期复员已于月初完成。计三个分区共复员七百七十余人（缺三分区）。冀南八路军野战军×旅直属队，亦按照复员计划于上月底复员一百零七人。现这批复员军人，正纷纷离部返里。他们走到每一个城镇，都受到群众热烈的欢迎，上月十七日，在左权城千余人的欢送大会上，复员军人王进中很感动的说：“我们回去后，一定忘不了保卫边区，假若反动派敢于向咱解放区进攻，我们马上又会重新拿起武器，坚决打碎那些侵犯者的猪头！”当他们经过群众割麦的广阔田野时，老乡们都放下收割，拥上来欢送他们，一位白胡子老汉，非常感奋的向战士们说：要是没有咱八路军，今年丰收的麦子，还能是咱百姓的？临别的时候，群众们均依依不舍。
    【本报邯郸十一日讯】顷据日前由昆明来解放区之失业军官为国民党军装甲兵第一团团部少校附官匡德成谈国民党对待失业军官的情形如下：重庆编余军官总队，除部队整批送进去的以外，个别复员的军官想单独入队，实在难于登天，该队自总队长以至人事组长，公然伸手要钱，入队运动费的定价是五万到十万，出了钱，不是军官也随时可以入队，否则即便抗战有功的军官也无法进门。一位曾经参加过抗战中历次主要战役的陈辉连长，身带多处头二等伤痕，荣誉证足足有一公文袋，但因无钱，又无门路可钻，一连登记了五次，都没有批准，只好满怀悲愤含着热泪回贵州另打主意了。有一个姓张的团副，到该队登记时，见到过去他部下的一个士兵花了钱，已弄了个连长名义入队了，而自己虽再四哀求却得不到登记的权利。上高栈里住满了此类等着登记的失业军官，他们把被子衣服卖光了也得不到丝毫怜悯。最后，匡德成少校无限愤慨的说：在重庆昆明市街上到处可以看到坐着汽车兜风的将军太太，但也到处可以看到衣衫褴褛的失业军官，他们愁眉不展，踯躅街头。
