　　【Our Correspondent in Changzhi】 Recently, in the old liberated areas of She County and Lincheng County, many instances of landlords抢收ing wheat from tenant farmers and failing to implement rent reduction decrees have been discovered. In Xili Village, She County, the landlord Shen Yulin seized two mu of land rented to Yang Yaodong last year. During the rent reduction campaign last winter, the land was returned to the tenant farmer for cultivation. Recently, Shen illegally 抢收ed the wheat from the tenant's land and pulled up the spring hemp. Hao Guangquan, a landlord in Xishan suburb, recently threatened his tenants to divide the wheat “fifty-fifty,” overturning the lease agreement. This spring, the landlord of Xiaqingliang has not yet returned the items that were supposed to be returned to the peasants during rent reduction. Li Wanke, a landlord in × Village, Lincheng, has now taken back the land that was rented to farmers in 1942 to shift the burden of taxes. Leng Bin, a landlord in Xiaweisi, is still withholding over a hundred land documents that should be returned to the peasants. The leadership of these two counties attaches great importance to these problems and is currently conducting thorough investigation and rent reduction in conjunction with the wheat harvest, to打退 illegal landlord counterattacks.
