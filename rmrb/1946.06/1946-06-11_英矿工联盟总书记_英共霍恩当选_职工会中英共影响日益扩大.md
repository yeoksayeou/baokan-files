Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: The influence of the British Communist Party in trade unions is growing. According to Reuters: In the Miners' Union, one of the all-British trade unions, Communist candidate Horne was elected as the union's general secretary. Horne is a member of the Executive Committee of the National Union of Mineworkers, the head of the union's national production increase campaign, and the chairman of the South Wales Miners' Federation, which has 200,000 members. The increased strength and influence of the British Communist Party among national trade unions is also reflected in the Transport and General Workers' Union, which has 3.25 million members. When this union considered re-electing its general secretary last November, British Communist Party Central Committee member, Babu Hua (a member of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress), was one of the candidates. The current chairman of the Amalgamated Engineering Union is Communist Party member, Tang Na. During last year's British Trades Union Congress discussion on cooperation between the British Communist Party and the Labour Party, 1,016 trade unions supported the British Communist Party's proposal for unity, which was beneficial to the workers' movement. The National Union of Mineworkers is one of the largest trade unions in Britain, with 700,000 members. The union's general secretary was originally Edward, who has now been transferred to the government's National Coal Board (which represents the Labour government in leading the miners) as secretary, and also serves as the chairman of the British Trades Union Congress.
