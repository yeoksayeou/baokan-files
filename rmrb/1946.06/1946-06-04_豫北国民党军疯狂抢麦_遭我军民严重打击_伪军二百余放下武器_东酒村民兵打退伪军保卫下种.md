    Northern Henan Kuomintang troops continue to seize wheat, suffering severe blows from our army and people. (1) More than 300 puppet troops under Cheng Daosheng in Anyang illegally occupied our Mengzhuang on the 24th, looting sickles and materials to arrange for seizing wheat. When our army recovered the area, more than 130 of these puppet soldiers laid down their arms, and more than 100 fled. (2) The puppet troops under Wang Ziquan, stationed in Anyang and Xindianji, invaded our Fengle on the night of the 28th, killing and wounding more than 30 people. The next day, they occupied our Houwanjin Village, and Wang Tao's puppet troops occupied our Qianwanjin. Our army fought bravely on the 29th and recovered Houwanjin, with more than 100 puppet soldiers laying down their arms. The Kuomintang and puppet troops in Anyang and Lingdu regrouped with more than 1,300 men and fiercely attacked us, but were also repelled by our army and people. (3) The puppet troops under Sun Dianying occupied Tongshan, west of Daokou, on the 25th, attempting to seize wheat. On the 29th, we recaptured the area.
    [Another Dispatch] The puppet security team under Wang Quanrong in Tangyin City, under the direct instigation of the Kuomintang reactionaries, are encroaching on our liberated areas and disrupting spring plowing and sowing. In late April, these puppets encroached on our three villages, Yanjiawa, Guanjiawa, etc., in the Third District, looting, killing, and plundering, stopping the people from farming. On April 22nd and 25th, they killed and wounded two women in Zhongshang Village. Currently, more than 20 hectares of land from east of Dongjiu Temple to the border of Wujiawa and Longjiawa cannot be cultivated. The local masses, unable to bear it any longer, have organized militia to armed resistance to the puppet troops, protecting production. The puppet troops have invaded our Dongjiu Temple four times in half a month in April, all of which were repelled by the village militia, protecting the masses. The local masses are very supportive of the militia and want to continue to consolidate and strengthen the militia to protect production.
