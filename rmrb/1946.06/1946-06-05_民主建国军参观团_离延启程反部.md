    Democratic National Construction Army Delegation
    Leaves Yan'an to Return to Their Units
    Delegation Leader Nie tells reporter: Our personal experience and observation proves that the Communist Party prioritizes the interests of the people, the Eighth Route Army is the best people's armed force in China, and they faithfully implement the Three Major Agreements.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd] The Democratic National Construction Army Delegation, after more than two months of inspection in Yan'an, departed yesterday to return to their units. General Nie Zhichao, the head of the delegation, told reporters today: "Our personal experience and observation proves that the Communist Party prioritizes the interests of the masses. In order to strive for the realization of peace and democracy in the country, they faithfully implement the Three Major Agreements." General Nie described the exemplary behavior of the liberated area's army in complying with the ceasefire order. He said: "When we passed through Wenshui, we rested at the Eighth Route Army headquarters about five miles outside the city. It happened that the Yan army and puppet troops in the city came out to harass us. The Eighth Route Army adopted a method of persuasion, sending people to deliver a letter to the Yan army, explaining the great righteousness and persuading them to abide by the ceasefire order." He continued: "From the Luliang Military Region to the border area, we saw the Eighth Route Army seriously and strictly carrying out demobilization and reorganization work." He said: "I have worked in the army for twenty years, but only today do I truly realize that the Eighth Route Army is the best people's armed force in China." He listed the facts he saw at the "Red Star" unit, "They have a platoon where everyone is literate, and seventeen soldiers have kept thick diaries. These ordinary soldiers can write such vivid diaries. This is such an amazing achievement!" General Nie also said, "The company and platoon leaders here are completely integrated with the soldiers in life. They criticize each other and reflect on each other during meetings, just like a harmonious family."
    At this point, General Nie recalled when he asked Chairman Mao for instructions on the work of the troops, Chairman Mao smiled and said to him: "We must always tell everyone to serve the people and be united with the people everywhere. It is enough for everyone to be able to do this." He also called Commander-in-Chief Zhu a loving parent. General Nie said: "Commander-in-Chief Zhu told us to listen carefully to the opinions of the soldiers, and to discuss everything with everyone, so that the soldiers will be easy to lead." General Nie repeatedly praised: "During the visit, I realized the truth of the instructions of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu."
    Speaking of the current domestic situation, General Nie Zhichao's face showed a worried and indignant expression. He condemned the Kuomintang reactionaries for undermining the Three Major Agreements and expanding the civil war in Northeast China, calling their sinful acts a betrayal of the people. He expressed great admiration for the Democratic Allied Army's overall situation and its tolerant attitude in withdrawing from Changchun.
    Nie Zhichao, General, is from Liaocheng, Shandong. He graduated from the fourth class of the Huangpu Military Academy and successively served as Major Staff Officer of the 76th Division, Battalion Commander of the Special Service Battalion of the 20th Route Army Headquarters, Lieutenant Colonel Adjutant of the 530th Regiment of the 89th Division, and Commander of the 265th Regiment. He is currently the Deputy Commander of the Second Division of the Democratic National Construction Army.

    民主建国军参观团
    离延启程反部
    聂团长语记者：我们以亲身经历和观察，证明共产党以人民利益为前提，八路军是中国最好的人民武装，忠实执行了三大协定。           
    【新华社延安二日电】民主建国军参观团在延安作了两月余的考察，已于昨日启程返部。该团团长聂志超将军，于今日接见记者时称：“我们以亲身经历和观察，证明共产党办事是以照顾人民大众利益为前提的。为争取在全国实现和平民主，忠实执行了三大协定”。聂将军描述出解放区军队遵守停战命令的模范行为，他说：“我们路过文水时，在城外五里许的八路军指挥部休息，适值城内的阎军和伪军出城骚扰，八路军采取了劝导方式，派人送信给阎军，晓以大义，劝其遵守停战命令。”他继说：“我们由吕梁军区至边区，沿途都看见八路军认真和严格地进行复员整军工作。”他说：“我在部队工作二十年，但我今日才真正认识了八路军是中国最好的人民武装”。他列举了在“红星”部所见事实，“他们有一个排，每人都识会很多字，有十七个战士记了很厚的日记。这些普通战士能写出这样生动的日记，这是何等惊人的成绩呀！”聂将军又说：“这里的连长排长与战士生活上完全打成一片，在开会时互相提出批评，互相进行反省，完全如一个和睦的家庭。”
    至此聂将军回忆起他向毛主席请求指示部队工作的意见时，毛主席笑着对他说：“要时时刻刻和大家讲为人民服务，处处和人民结合在一起。大家都能办到这一条就够了”。他又称呼朱总司令是慈爱的家长。聂将军说：“总司令叮咛我们要仔细倾听战士的意见，凡事大家商量着办，兵就很好带了”。聂将军连声称赞说：“我在参观中，才悟透了毛主席总司令指示的真理”。
    谈到目前国内时局时，聂志超将军脸上呈现忧虑愤慨表情。他斥责国民党反动派破坏三大协定，扩大东北内战的罪恶行为为背叛人民的作法。对于此次民主联军顾全大局，撤出长春的忍让态度，则表示十分感佩。
    聂志超将军山东聊城人。黄埔军校四期毕业，历任七六师少校参谋，二十路总指挥部特务营营长，八九师五三○团中校团附，二六五团团长等职。现任民主建国军第二师副师长。
