Xinhua News Agency, Huai'an, 18th—The current situation in Central China is extremely tense. The Kuomintang, with a large army of twenty-seven divisions, is surrounding and invading the Su-Wan Liberated Areas, and has already occupied the entire western Fourth District of the Huainan Railway. This reporter specifically interviewed General Zhang Dingcheng, commander of the Central China Military Region, to inquire about his views and attitude towards the current situation. He issued the following statement:

Commander Zhang first pointed out: The current situation in Central China is very serious. Due to the Kuomintang reactionaries deploying a large army of twenty-seven divisions in the Huainan, Huaibei, Central Jiangsu, and Northern Jiangsu regions, and already launching a reactionary all-out offensive, a large-scale civil war is on the verge of breaking out. The creation of this serious situation is entirely due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' willful expansion of the civil war and destruction of peace. Therefore, the Kuomintang reactionaries should bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from this.

After the ceasefire order was announced, the Kuomintang army, under the secret order to "seize strategic locations," successively occupied our cities of Liuhe, Jingjiang, Taixing, and Haimen. Even after the ceasefire order took effect, and after the executive groups arrived in Central China, they never ceased their attacks on our army. In the past four months, they have occupied the following important towns and villages: In Central Jiangsu: Baipu, Zhaotai, Ximachang, Taifangtou, Gangkou, Daqiao, Simazhen, Yangjiaqiao, Sanjiang, Tiansha, Changle, Lingdian, Xiaochang, Xingren, Chenjiaqiao, Dashengqiao, Xinshenggang; in Huainan: Leiguanji, Donggou, Maodunzi, Chengqiao, Chenjiagou; in Huaibei: Tuohe, Haocheng, Sanpu, Licanji, Zhanglou, Duanlou, Qianhou Ranfang, Foji, and dozens of other market towns (not including ordinary villages). They have also occupied Xiaoxian County twice and Xiayi County once. Wherever they go, they burn, kill, and loot, causing incalculable losses to the people. Our army has consistently adhered to the ceasefire agreement, making concessions again and again, only resorting to self-defense when absolutely necessary. Since May, internal war experts such as He Yingqin, Bai Chongxi, and Tang Enbo have repeatedly traveled between Xuzhou, Nanjing, Yangzhou, and Nantong, deploying troops and actively making arrangements for a full-scale offensive. The Kuomintang Jiangsu Provincial Government and Provincial Party Headquarters have dispatched a large number of county magistrates, commissioners, and party affairs instructors to northern Jiangsu, attempting to establish special agent organizations in various places to coordinate with their military offensive. Kuomintang newspapers in Shanghai and Nanjing are loudly calling for the "military recovery of Northern Jiangsu," creating public opinion for the offensive. Since the 10th of last month, they have even used three divisions to launch a large-scale offensive against our western Huainan Railway (Fourth District) region, occupying Dingyuan and all major and minor market towns. Although the New Fourth Army headquarters and military region headquarters have repeatedly lodged serious protests with the Nanjing Three-Man Committee, the Beiping Executive Headquarters, and the Xuzhou and Huaiyin executive groups, we have not yet received any response or correction. Recently, Kuomintang troops have been actively operating in the Yangzhou, Taixing, Nantong, and Haimen areas, claiming they want to seize Central Jiangsu. On the Huainan front, they have redeployed parts of the 77th Division, 58th Division, 93rd Division, and 132nd Division to occupy our Lai'an City and Shiguanji. Kuomintang troops stationed in Caocun on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway have also invaded our Xiao (County) Tong (Mountain) region in Huaibei, occupying Shixiangji and other places. They are also using American-made airplanes to continuously conduct reconnaissance, strafing, and bombing of peaceful residents in our rear cities. Isn't it clear who is undermining the ceasefire agreement, who is the culprit of the civil war, and who should bear full responsibility for launching the civil war?

Commander Zhang then listed many facts of the Kuomintang reactionaries' treachery in manufacturing bloody incidents and launching military offensives throughout the country since the issuance of the ceasefire agreement, explaining that this large-scale offensive against the Central China Liberated Area by these reactionaries is precisely a part of their plan to launch a full-scale civil war.

Finally, Commander Zhang solemnly stated: The Kuomintang reactionaries' arrogance has reached its peak, and our tolerance has reached its limit. We formally warn that group of reactionary elements and warmongering elements: If you are determined to destroy the peaceful and democratic Central China Liberated Area, we will also resolutely defend the Central China Liberated Area. Wherever you attack from, we will launch a resolute counterattack in self-defense. At the same time, Commander Zhang called on all party members, government officials, soldiers, and civilians in Central China to urgently mobilize to defend their homes, defend the peaceful and democratic Central China Liberated Area, strengthen various construction efforts, and resolutely and thoroughly crush the Kuomintang reactionaries' barbaric offensive.

Commander Zhang then repeatedly and sincerely expressed, with deep sorrow, that we have always strived for peace and opposed civil war with all our efforts. We deeply know that once war breaks out, the people will suffer unbearable disasters. Therefore, we still sincerely hope that the Kuomintang authorities can pull back from the brink, order their troops on all fronts to immediately cease their attacks, and withdraw from all occupied areas, and not close the door to peace negotiations. We further hope that all officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army can deeply understand the righteousness of the situation, emulate the righteous deeds of General Gao Shuxun and General Pan Shuoduan, and join hands with us to jointly oppose civil war. He also called on people from all walks of life across the country to speak out for justice and stop the Kuomintang reactionaries' reckless actions of being enemies of the people and courting their own doom.

　　张鼎丞将军发表谈话
    华中形势异常紧张
    国民党大军集结不断侵犯解放区
    我已忍无可忍将坚决的自卫反击
    【新华社淮安十八日电】目前华中形势异常紧张，国民党以二十七个师的大军，向苏皖解放区包围进犯，并曾侵占淮南路西四分区全部地区，记者特往访华中军区司令员张鼎丞将军，叩以对目前形势的看法和态度，承其发表谈话如次：
    张司令员首先指出：目前华中形势十分严重。由于国民党反动派在淮南、淮北、苏中、苏北各地区布置二十七个师的大军和已经开始反动的全面进攻，大规模的内战，有一触即发之势。这种严重形势的造成，完全是国民党反动派一意扩大内战破坏和平所致，因此而引起的一切后果，应由国民党反动派方面负其全责。
    在停战令公布后，国民党军队即在“抢占战略要点”的密令下，先后占我六合、靖江、泰兴、海门等城。在停战令生效以后，即在执行小组到达华中以后，也从未停止过对我军的进攻。四个多月来，侵占我重要市镇计有：苏中之白蒲、赵泰、西马厂、泰坊头、港口、大桥、嘶马镇、杨家桥、三疆、天裟、长乐、灵甸、小厂、兴仁、陈家桥、大生桥、新生港，淮南之雷官集、东沟、毛墩子、程桥、陈家沟；淮北之沱河、濠城、三铺、李灿集、张楼、段楼、前后染坊、佛集等数十集镇（普通村庄还不在内），并曾两度占领我萧县城，一度占领我夏邑城。所到之处，烧杀抢掠，人民损失难以算计。我军方面，则始终遵守停战协定，一让再让，仅在万不得已时，就要实行自卫。五月份以来，何应钦、白崇禧、汤恩伯等内战专家，更先后往来于徐州、南京、扬州、南通之间，调兵遣将，积极作全面进攻布置。国民党江苏省政府与省党部，则大批委派江北各县长专员及党务指导员等，俾在各地建立特务机关，企图配合其军事进攻。上海南京等地，国民党报纸则大叫其“武力收复苏北”，制造进攻的舆论。从上月十日起，竟以三个师的兵力，向我淮南路西（四分区）地区大举进犯，占我定远及全部大小集镇。我新四军军部及军区司令部虽曾屡向南京三人委员会、北平执行部，及徐州淮阴各执行小组提出严重抗议，迄未见有何项答复或纠正。近日国民党军，复在扬州、泰兴、南通、海门一带大肆活动，扬言要夺取苏中。在淮南方面，复以七十七师、五十八师、九十三师、一百三十二师各一部兵力，占我来安城、施官集。驻津浦线曹村之国民党军，亦进犯我淮北萧（县）铜（山）地区，占我石相集等地。并使用美造飞机，不断在我后方各城市进行侦察与扫射、轰炸和平居民。谁在破坏停战协定，谁是内战祸首，谁应负发动内战的全部责任，还不明白吗？
    张司令员继即列举自停战协定颁布以来，国民党反动派背信弃义，在全国各地制造血案，发动军事进攻的许多事实，说明此种反动派对华中解放区的大举进攻，正是他们发动全国内战计划中的一部份。
    最后，张司令员严正表示：国民党反动派猖狂已到了登峰造极的地步，我们的忍让也已经到了极点，我们正式警告那批反动分子、好战分子：你们决心破坏和平民主的华中解放区，我们也一定要坚决保卫华中解放区。你们从那里进攻，我们就将从那里进行坚决的自卫反击。同时，张司令员号召华中所有党政军民，紧急动员起来保卫家乡，保卫和平民主的华中解放区，加强各种建设工作，坚决彻底地粉碎国民党反动派的野蛮进攻。
    张司令员旋复恳切沈痛再三表示，我们从来是用一切努力争取和平反对内战的，我们深知战端一开，人民将遭到难以忍受的灾难，所以仍然诚恳希望国民党当局能够悬崖勒马，命令其各线军队立即停止进攻，并退出各个侵占区，不要关闭和平谈判之门。更希望国民党军队的全体官兵，能够深明大义，效法高树勋将军、潘朔端将军的义举，和我们携手合作，共同反对内战。他同时呼吁全国各界人士，能仗义执言，制止国民党反动派这种与人民为敌，而自投绝境的狂悖行动。
