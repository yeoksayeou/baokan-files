    Jinan 110,000 People Oppose Traitors
    Middle and Upper-Class Citizens Begin to Understand Our Policy
    [Heze, 8th Dispatch] In Jinan City, 110,000 people are involved in the movement to oppose traitors and speak out about suffering. The masses are accusing and settling accounts with traitors, enemy agents, and local bullies. A total of 261,395 jin of grain and 26,812,500 yuan (local currency) have been seized. During the movement, excluding workers' organizations, 3,631 people have joined mass organizations such as the Citizens' Association and the Poor People's Association, and established citizens' self-defense forces, and some have organized mass cooperatives. The lower-level organs of power that oppressed the masses, organized in the past by enemy puppets and local bullies, have been overthrown. The masses have exposed the puppet Baolizhang (chiefs of the Baojia system), street chiefs, and their backers. This has made the broad masses and the middle and upper-class citizens understand that our policy is to eliminate harm for the people, and it is not to make everyone poor. It is to support the poor to stand up and become masters, so that everyone can become rich. Now the doubts and fears of some upper-class elements who did not understand us have been dispelled.

    济宁十一万人反奸
    中上层市民开始了解我政策
    【荷泽八日电】济宁市十一万群众卷入反奸诉苦运动。群众控诉与清算汉奸敌特恶霸分子。清算出粮食二六一三九五斤，款子（本币）二六八一二五○○元。运动中，除工人组织不计外，已有三六三一人参加了市民会、贫民会等群众团体，并建立了市民的自卫武装，部分的组织了群众性合作社。以前由敌伪恶霸组织的压迫群众的下层政权机构的被推垮，伪保长、街长，以及他们的后台老板都被群众的检举，这使广大群众以及中上层市民，了解了我们的政策，是为民除害，也并非叫人人变穷。是要扶植穷人翻身，使人人都富，现在一些不了解我们的上层分子的疑惧心理已告打破。
