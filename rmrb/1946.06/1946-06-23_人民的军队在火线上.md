The People's Army on the Front Lines
Yi Sheng, Ruo Liu

The city will definitely be opened!

Through the trench dug last night, we can go straight to our southern gate position. Although a long section is still being excavated, enemy cold shots occasionally sweep over our heads, blocking pedestrians and shooting at the soldiers digging trenches on the highway. "Don't scare the master!" A young comrade cursed, forcefully shoveling up a shovel of soil, the sweat on his arm flowed onto the shovel handle, mixed with the soil, and waved it to the trench.

Walking into the trench, I found slogans such as "Resolutely Eliminate" and "Strive to be a Model" on the new walls. Judging from the crooked and blurred handwriting, these were drawn by the soldiers during nighttime earthwork operations.

The comrades in the company were resting, some lying on the ground. We found Director Yin of the 809th Unit in the pile of soldiers. He was already very tired; but when he talked about last night's battle, he was excited: "The movements of the Ninth and Seventh Companies were too good, even faster than the usual exercises!" He briefly introduced the situation last night, and we followed the comrades of the Seventh Company to see the terrain for the charge.

Deputy Company Commander Kong Xiangli was a tall comrade. Our impression of him was: a young and brave commander. He was very concerned about the soldiers, and repeatedly told us every time we passed a blockade: "Be careful, be careful, bravery is not the time yet!"

We talked with a group of warriors in the assault platoon: "Yesterday, we simply couldn't catch up, the enemy ran like rabbits."

"Before the bugle call of the army headquarters had even finished, my squad had already completed the search and was digging gun emplacements in the room!"

"I chased to the northeast hut, where there was a group of enemies. The third platoon leader asked: 'Where are your guns?'"

"The company commander took them!"

"Where are the bullets?"

"Used them all up!"

"How brave!"

"We have to fight with bayonets!"

"Everyone was angered by these words. The company commander knocked down nine of them in one breath, so we avenged our dead comrades!"

You said a word, I said a word, this courage, this determination, gave us a firm belief in victory: "The city will definitely be opened."

"This is good blood, the blood of comrades!"

Assault troops Meng Xian'en, Li Xinzhen, and Wang Dianjun are three very young comrades, but their experience and courage are abundant. Li Xinzhen was liberated after fighting in Jining, but now he is just like the old comrades. He said: "As long as you are fierce! Not afraid of sacrifice, you can complete the task. You can't cry when you are injured, if you cry, you will strengthen the enemy's courage; it's like fighting, he hits you one punch, you hit him two punches, if you are a 'coward', he will give you a few punches, and you are done! Others are just dead people, and it's no use if you are timid..." On another little comrade's foot, there was a blood stain. We thought he was injured, he said: "No! No! This is from carrying the wounded." Wang Dianjun said: "This is good blood, the blood of comrades."

Meng Xian'en, wearing a steel helmet, walked in. Company Commander Kong across the street shouted: "Little Meng, are you ready?" Little Meng turned his head back: "Ready! Don't worry, I'm going to show you something!" All three assault troops were wearing steel helmets, and the people next to them joked: "When you go up, the enemy will see, the old Eighth Route Army, the old Red Army are coming!" causing everyone to burst into laughter. The title of "Old Eighth Route Army, Old Red Army" is proud and glorious.

The battlefield shows heroes!

The sun is at noon.

The signalman conveyed: "Troop movement!"

The people who were sleeping soundly also jumped up suddenly, put their guns on their backs, touched the grenades, and walked out the door. Those who were setting up ladders were all chanting catching sparrows! Catching sparrows!

In the outer trenches, Comrade Kong Xiangli spoke: "Comrades! When we come back, we must give a big thumbs up! If the enemy doesn't surrender, stab him!" The soldiers subconsciously looked at their shining bayonets, the sun flashed, and it was dazzling!

Battalion Political Commissar Li Yan came over and shouted: "Quan Lijin has really hung my belt." It turned out that on the way marching yesterday, Quan Lijin of the Seventh Platoon bet with Political Commissar Li: "If you become a combat hero, I will give you my belt!" Sure enough, the first person to climb the walled city was Quan Lijin. After he climbed up, he shouted loudly, "I, Quan Lijin, am here!" The enemy ran away as if they had been electrocuted, and our comrades ran up quickly. This morning, he took the political commissar's belt and hung it proudly on his shoulder.

Capturing the pass is the first step to attacking the city.

After noon, the fierce battle began, and we captured the last small walled village in the southern gate.

Like a gust of wind, we couldn't tell if it was gunfire or the hiss of bullets, we only felt that a lot of sand and debris were flying around our ears.

The people at the rope and tape station were nervously changing the bandages for the wounded.

The person carrying an empty box ran up again, carrying two shells!

The assault comrades of the Seventh Company jumped into the waist-deep ditch. Twenty minutes later, they climbed up the village. The enemy concentrated firepower from the east, west, and front to block the breakthrough. Meng Xian'en was injured as soon as he went up. Li Xinzhen fought the enemy with bayonets and rolled down the village, but people kept climbing! Climbing! Company Commander Kong was advancing with the soldiers with a bayonet. His hands and legs were injured!

The terrain was so unfavorable! Everyone on the front line was anxious!

"Comrades, hold on for the last minute!" Comrade Kong Xiangli shouted, so the soldiers stared at their blurred eyes and gripped their guns tighter and tighter.

Our army repeatedly charged the enemy! Once, twice...five times....

After Comrade Kong Xiangli covered the comrades to come down, he retreated with a bayonet that was already bent and unusable. This knife had pierced the chests of more than ten enemies.

Another unit rushed over to take over their mission.

We followed the Seventh Company back to the rear.

Traitors are always a scourge if they are not eliminated.

Comrade Kong Xiangli was somewhat dazed by the killing. He was still shouting on the stretcher: "Charge! Fight! All the beloved comrades of the Seventh Company! We will always be together!"

"We are for the people, for the poor! Kill the traitors!"

Everyone wanted him to be quiet and feed him soup! He kept shouting: "For the common people, for the common people!" The civilians around the stretcher said while holding the soup: "Company commander! The common people are asking you to drink a bowl of soup." He suddenly became a little sober, looked at us: "Ah! You are comrades from the column, you want to write about the Seventh Company..." After that, he became confused again.

This is the spirit of the Eighth Route Army serving the people, this is the reason why the Eighth Route Army will surely win.

What did we see? The old company commander, the three little warriors wearing steel helmets, the Seventh Company, all the heroes fighting for the people on the front lines!

We listened to Comrade Kong Xiangli and wrote the heroic deeds of these heroes to the party newspaper, and told the comrades-in-arms of the whole army and the people in the rear.

That night, we began to write. (Night of the 22nd)

　　人民的军队在火线上
    怡生　若流
    城是一定能打开的！
    通过昨夜挖成的交通沟可以直达我们南关的阵地，虽然还有好长一段正在修掘，敌人的冷枪不时在头上掠过，封锁行人，射击公路上挖沟的战士。“不要吓唬老爷吧！”一个年青的同志骂了一声，用力铲起一铲土，臂上的汗流到铲把上，和着土一齐挥到沟上去。
    走到沟里，发现在新壁上有“坚决消灭”“争取模范”的标语，从字迹的歪斜模糊来推测，这是战士们在夜间土工作业时划上的。
    连里的同志们正在休息，有的躺在地上。我们在战士堆里找见了八○九部队的阴主任，他已经很疲劳了；但一谈起昨夜的战斗，却振奋了他的精神：“九、七连的动作太好了，比平时演习都快呀！”他简单介绍了昨夜的情况，我们便随了七连同志去看冲锋的地形。
    副连长孔祥立同志高高的个子，给我们的印象是：一个青年勇敢的指挥员，他非常关心战士，每通过一个封锁口都再三的嘱咐：“小心，小心，勇敢还不到时候呢！”
    在突击排里和一群勇士们谈起来：“昨天简直追不上，敌人跟兔子一样的跑了。”
    “部队指挥所的冲锋号音还没落，俺班早搜索完，在房里挖枪眼哩！”
    “俺追到东北小屋里，那边有一伙敌人，三排长问：“你们的枪呢？”
    “连长拿去了！”
    “子弹呢？”
    “打完了！”
    “怪有种！”
    “刺刀也得拼几个！”
    “大家被这话气火了，连长一气放倒他九个，咱死的同志们的仇算报啦！”
    你一言我一语，这勇气，这决心，给了我们一个胜利的坚确信念：“城是一定能打得开的。”
  “这是好血，同志的血！”
    突击手孟宪恩、李心贞、王殿军是三个年纪很轻的小同志，但他们的经验和勇气，都是丰满的。李心贞是打济宁才解放来的，现在却和老同志一样了。他说：“只要猛！不怕牺牲就能完成任务。负了伤不能哭，你一哭就给敌人壮了胆；跟打架一样，他打你一拳，你打他两拳，要是你一‘裂怯’，他崩崩就是几拳，你就完啦！别人就是死人，你发怯也不中……”在另一个小同志的脚上流着一块血斑，我们以为他挂了彩，他说：“不！不！这是背伤号染的。”王殿军说：“这是好血，同志的血。”
    孟宪恩戴着一顶钢盔跨进门来，对面房子里的孔副连长喊：“小孟准备好了不？”小孟回过头：“好了！放心吧，准备给你露一鼻子！”三个突击手都带着钢盔，旁边的人打趣道：“你一上去，敌人一看，老八路老红军上来了！”惹得众人哄然大笑。“老八路，老红军”这称号是骄傲而光荣的。
  战场显英雄！
    太阳正午了。
    通信员传达：“部队运动”！
    睡得很沈的人们，也霍的一下跳起来，背上枪，摸一摸手榴弹走到门外去。架梯子的都念着捉麻雀！捉麻雀！
    在外壕里，孔祥立同志讲话了：“同志们！我们回来的时候，要树起大姆指呀！敌人不缴枪就戳了他！”战士们下意识的看看自己发光的刺刀，太阳一闪，亮得耀眼！
    营政治委员李焰走来喊：“权利金真个挂上我的皮带了。”原来昨天行军的路上，七班的权利金和李政委打赌：“假使你当了战斗英雄，我把皮带送给你！”果然，爬围城的第一名是权利金，他爬上去以后大声叫着“我权利金上来了！”敌人象触电一样吓跑了，我们的同志紧跑上来。今天早晨，他拿了政治委员的皮带，得意的横挂在肩上。
  攻城先夺关。
    正午以后，激战便展开，我们夺取南关最后的一个小围寨。
    像刮风一样，听不出那是枪响，那是弹嘶，只觉得不少的沙土破片在耳边飞鸣。
    绳带所的人紧张的给伤员换药。
    扛下一个空箱子的人，扛着两个炮弹又跑上去！
    突击的七连同志们，跳下腰深的水沟，二十分钟后，爬上寨子，敌人东、西、正面集中火力封锁突破口，孟宪恩上去就负了伤，李心贞和敌人拚了刺刀滚下寨去，人还是继续的爬呀！爬呀！孔副连长端着刺刀和战士们一起前进着。他的手和腿都负了伤！
    地形是多么不利呀！火线上所有的人在焦急着！
    “同志们坚持最后一分钟啊！”孔祥立同志喊，于是战士们瞪一瞪混花的眼睛把枪握得更紧，更紧。
    我军和敌人反复冲击！一次二次……五次……。
    孔祥立同志掩护同志们下来之后，他扛着已经弯曲不能用的刺刀退下来，这刀曾刺进十个以上敌人的胸膛。
    另一支部队飞奔来接替了他们的任务。
    我们随着七连一同回到后方来。
        汉奸不灭总是祸害。
    孔祥立同志杀得有些浑迷了，他在担架上仍然喊着：“冲！打！七连全体亲爱的同志们！我们永远在一起！”
    “我们为了人民，为了穷人！打死汉奸！”
    大家要他安静一下，喂他汤喝！他仍不住的嚷：“为了老百姓，为了老百姓！”担架周围的民夫端着汤说：“连长！老百姓叫你喝碗汤。”他忽然清醒了一些，看看我们：“啊！你们是纵队的同志，要把七连的事写……”以后他便又糊涂起来。
    这便是八路军为人民的精神，这便是八路军所以必胜的道理。
    我们看见？老连长，看见了三个戴钢盔的小勇士，看见了七连，看见了所有前方为人民战斗的英雄！
    我们听孔祥立同志的话，把这些英雄的事迹写给党报，告诉全军的战友，告诉后方的人民。
    这天晚上，我们便动起笔来。          （二十二日夜）
