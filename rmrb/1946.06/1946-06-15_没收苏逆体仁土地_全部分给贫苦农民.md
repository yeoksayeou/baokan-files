    Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 11th—The land of the big traitor and puppet Governor of Shanxi, Su Tiren, in Shuo County, has been completely confiscated by the democratic government and distributed to landless or land-poor peasants. The traitor Su owned 1,300 mu of good land in the Fifth District of Shuo County, which he leased to tenant farmers at high rents. After the government announced the confiscation, the masses democratically discussed the distribution method. The land originally rented by the landless poor people will still be cultivated by them, and the land ownership belongs to the tenants. The land originally cultivated by hired laborers and shared-cropping farmers will be redistributed to the hired laborers and peasants. In addition, 800 mu of land seized by the enemy's water conservancy company in the area, in addition to being returned to the original owners, the other public land and newly added wasteland that was seized will still be distributed to the masses according to the above method. More than 500 families have received land, with each family receiving approximately three or four mu.
