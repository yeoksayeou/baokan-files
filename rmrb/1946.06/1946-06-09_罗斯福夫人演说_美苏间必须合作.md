    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: The U.S. Information Service, New York, reports: On May 30th, Eleanor Roosevelt delivered a speech to graduating students at Bard College in this city, strongly advocating for U.S.-Soviet cooperation. She began by stating, "If we want peace to come, we must cooperate with the Soviet Union." She said, "Understanding is a two-way street, and it would be unfortunate for you if we cannot cooperate for some reason. Therefore, you must remember that what you do should demonstrate the true essence of democracy, which is not only written in our Constitution or Bill of Rights, but must also show its true meaning in action." According to a United Press report: Former Undersecretary of State Welles, in a radio address one day, strongly asserted: "What is needed now is complete understanding between the U.S. and the Soviet Union." He said: "The solution to the current serious situation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union depends on a meeting between Truman and Stalin." He concluded by saying: "The firmness of American policy is of course necessary, but if these policies cannot be realized, they will produce the completely opposite effect."

    【新华社延安六日电】美新闻处纽约讯：五月三十日罗斯福夫人在此间巴特大学向毕业学生演说，力主美苏合作。首称：“欲使和平届临，吾人必须与苏联合作”。她说：“谅解为双方之事，吾人如因某种理由而不能合作，实为你们之不幸。因此你们必须牢记你们之所作所为，以显示民主主义之真谛，并非仅在吾人之宪法或权利案中所书者，而必须在行动上表现其真正之意义”。另据合众社讯：前副国务卿威尔斯，一日在其广播演说中力称：“目前所需者，即为美苏间之完全谅解。”他说：“目前美苏间严重局势之解决，有赖杜鲁门与斯大林之晤谈”。他结语称：“美国政策之坚定自属必要，但此等政策如不能实现，将产生完全相反之效果”。
