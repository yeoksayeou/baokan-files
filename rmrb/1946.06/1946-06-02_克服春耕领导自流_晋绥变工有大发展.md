Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 27th. In various parts of Jin-Sui, by overcoming the spontaneous nature of district and village-level leadership in spring plowing, labor exchange organizations have been established one after another. In Xing County, through district and village meetings, after pointing out deviations, conducting current affairs and policy education, and raising the awareness of cadres, production leadership in various villages has been strengthened. In the Second District, more than 1,060 mutual aid and labor exchange groups have been organized, and 40% of the district's cattle have participated in labor exchange. Yangjia Village assigned cadres to the masses, mobilized and led 12 labor exchange groups. In the third and fourth districts of Lishi, village cadres strictly divided labor, with each village cadre participating in labor exchange and specifically leading seven or eight households. The labor exchange groups in Taicun are enthusiastically sowing autumn fields. In Hequ, while correcting the cadres' mentality of being satisfied with the masses' production enthusiasm this year and leading production from outside, village cadres have played a leading role. In the Third District, 283 labor exchange groups have been organized. Labor hero Yang Qingxuan took the lead in uniting the activists among the cadres to lead a labor exchange group, promoting 38 households in the village to engage in labor exchange production, and also extracting 32 laborers to dig licorice, earning 120,000 yuan in March. In Baode and other places, on the basis of the old forms of labor exchange organizations, the masses were inspired to adopt new forms of labor exchange, which has gradually improved. In Zhaojiazhuang and other villages in the Third District, they adopted large labor exchange groups, democratic work recording, and work evaluation methods to organize surplus labor for engaging in sideline occupations such as wasteland reclamation, coal mining, and transportation.
