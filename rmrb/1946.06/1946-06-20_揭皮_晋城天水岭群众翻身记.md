    "Peeling the Skin"
     ——A Story of Emancipation of the Masses in Tianshui Ridge, Jincheng
    Zhu Xiang, Lin Wei
    In Tianshui Ridge Village, Jincheng, there used to be seven despotic landlords in power. Headed by Zhao Jingwen and Zhao Fengqi, they formed a usurious group, which was also a despotic ruling group, called the "Tongtai Association." They used the grain obtained through corruption as capital to lend grain on account. They would lend in the spring and collect in the fall, with interest rates of "one plus three," reaching "one plus five" in famine years. Every year when collecting grain, they would beat gongs and issue orders, demanding that everything be paid in full, with a maximum deadline of three days. If the three days were up, even if you handed it over at the crack of dawn, you would still have to pay double. The masses called this "cock-crow interest."
    Xiao Gen borrowed three dou of beans from the Tongtai Association. When the deadline arrived, the grain was not dry, so he couldn't hand it over. He dried it overnight, threshed it, and sent it over, but it happened to be at the crack of dawn, so he had to pay double, including the principal and interest. Xiao Gen pleaded repeatedly, but they showed no leniency. His family's four mu of good land, on which they depended for their livelihood, fell into the hands of the Tongtai Association. The masses warned each other: "We would rather let our children starve than eat the beans of the Tongtai Association!"
    Guo Gelian's family originally had 60 mu of meager land, with cattle and sheep. Just because his child was young and ignorant, and ate a melon in someone else's field, Zhao Jingwen hung him from the beam for a whole day and night and fined him 200 yuan, which was converted into two pieces of cloth, each weighing three jin and two liang. Gelian bought them, but Zhao weighed them with a large scale, and they only weighed three jin, so he refused to accept them. He was forced to go all the way to Xiaohua to buy them before handing them over. Even then, it wasn't enough; they wanted to expel him from the community! After saying countless good words, he was finally allowed to hold an eight-eight banquet to settle the matter. From then on, he also owed the Tongtai Association a lot of debt, and quickly his land, cattle, and sheep all fell into the bloody hands of the Tongtai Association. He and his old father endured hardship carrying loads over the mountains, not even daring to smoke a pipe, but the money they earned all went into the "bottomless pit," and he never paid off the interest to the Tongtai Association. What hurt him the most, what humiliated him the most, and what he could never forget, was that his only old cotton robe was stripped off his body and taken away. He only mentioned this when talking to others who were suffering the same fate. He said: "I had my skin peeled off by them!" He would shed tears whenever he mentioned it.
    Zhao Quntai owed money to the Tongtai Association, and the interest was due in September. He estimated that he would not be able to pay it, so in March he secretly sold his house and land, hoping to make some money by carrying loads, so that he could at least feed himself. Who knew the news leaked out, and the Tongtai Association immediately came and confiscated the money (according to the "law" of the Tongtai Association, debtors had no right to dispose of their own property). His parents both starved to death. His brothers secretly sold the door panels and stove, and each took their wives and children, and sobbed as they parted ways in the middle of the night, each escaping for their lives (according to the Tongtai Association's "law," debtors had no right to flee famine without permission). Later, his brothers, sisters-in-law, and nephews all starved to death. Of the twelve people in his family, only three are left now.
    Of the 159 households in Tianshui Ridge, 80 percent were debtors of the Tongtai Association. After the Tongtai Association intensified its exploitation and plunder during the famines of the past few years, most of their land and property were lost. One hundred and forty-five people fled the famine, and eighty-three were forced to death or starved to death. Those who did not die ate bran and vegetable soup, becoming so thin that they would "fall over in the wind." At night they would "curl up by the stove" and wear "turn-around clothes" (sleeveless tattered clothes that could be rotated on the body), eking out a living and living in tears.
    At the same time, the land of the despotic landlords of the Tongtai Association increased several times over. They actively maintained the enemy. Zhao Jingwen also served as the chairman of the maintenance association, relying on the power of the enemy to seek wealth and force lives, becoming even more unscrupulous. The deceased great despot Zhao Fengqi, under the instructions of Zhao Jingwen, often brutally beat peasants and single-handedly forced many people to their deaths.
    The signal of the collapse of the dark old world, the signal of the emancipation of the suffering and oppressed peasants, finally reached Tianshui Ridge in April of this year!
    "Clear debts! Reduce rent! Speak out about your sufferings! Seek justice for your grievances! Chairman Mao is calling on us, the suffering people, to emancipate ourselves and overturn the flagstones!" The peasants of Tianshui Ridge, hearing these new phrases that they had never heard before, were all stirred up. They were both surprised and happy, and spread the word to each other with a mixture of belief and disbelief, repeatedly asking the work team members for confirmation. Finally, it was confirmed: "It's true!"
    The mutes who had been eating bitter herbs, whom people had always thought "couldn't speak," now opened their mouths. Guo Gelian said: "It's not that I, Guo Gelian, couldn't speak! It's that the thousand-jin flagstone was pressing down on me, preventing me from speaking!"
    Like the Yellow River bursting its banks, the peasants' bitterness and tears overflowed. Beside spinning wheels, by millstones, in houses, on streets, in fields, bitterness and tears poured out from every corner. Everywhere you could hear women sobbing, children crying, old people lamenting, and impatient people angrily cursing.
    Guo Gelian, in the winter school, recounted the history of his family's bankruptcy and the hardship of his life, crying until he lost consciousness. Zhao Quntai cried for his nine family members, especially his older brother, crying for three days and three nights, becoming delirious and unable to eat. A widow, when mentioning her starved child, mentioning the miserable scene of herself wearing "turn-around clothes" and suffering from cold and humiliation, burst into tears, constantly calling out her child's name, and no one could stop her. Generally, people had no heart to work: "Who are we working for? No matter how much we harvest, they will still grab it all!" Guo Gelian, who had been rescued, busied himself, saying: "I'm going to suffocate!"
    The Tianshui Ridge peasants' great denunciation of the crimes of the Tongtai Association began to subside somewhat after several days. Due to excessive grief, they had become half-crazed. Zhao Quntai's denunciation was no longer speaking, but a series of wails, breathless and disjointed:
    "Tongtai Association! Cannibal insects! So cruel! Squeezed us dry of our houses and land! Wanted to escape! No travel money! Took down the door panels! Dismantled the stove! Dug out the fire pits! Removed the floorboards! Dared not sell them during the day! Carried them on our backs to sell at midnight! Sold them for three sheng of millet and half a sheng of black flour! Escaped in the middle of the night! Stopped the children's mouths! Walked outside the village in the middle of the night! Brothers and sisters parted ways! Brothers, sisters-in-law, and nephews went and never returned! My brother! Father! Mother! You died so unjustly!" He shouted himself hoarse, fainted, and lost consciousness. The masses rushed up to pinch his arms, legs, and neck, panicking. An old woman heard the sound and cried out: "This is not the world of the Tongtai Association anymore! This is our place to speak out about our sufferings! Wake up!"
    The masses woke up and continued to cry and shout: "Tongtai Association! So hateful! Today we're rebelling against the Tongtai Association! I'd be happy to be shot tomorrow!"
    The masses shouted through tears: "If you're not sad, you won't cry!" "One person's suffering is everyone's suffering! One person's debt is everyone's debt!" "The Tongtai Association is like a thousand-jin stone! Unless we smash the thousand-jin stone, we cannot emancipate ourselves!"
    Gen Niu's mother cried and shouted, demanding her son from the Tongtai Association, violently hitting the debtor with her head. Another person, demanding their parents from the Tongtai Association, refused the debtor's voluntary "compensation," shouting, "There is only rebirth of children, not rebirth of parents! I want you to pay with your life!" Quntai also did not want compensation. He shouted: "I don't want gold, silver, or treasures! I want my own flesh and blood!" All the suffering people demanding their lives were shouting and wailing in the meeting place.
    Six people in a row spoke of their sufferings, and all six fainted. The seven landlords of the Tongtai Association stood in a row with their heads lowered, trying their best to avoid looking. But that was by no means "not wanting to bear to look," but regretting the loss of their authority. They had only ever বিরক্তedly cursed: "Dead? Serves you right! Blame your mother for not raising you in a black-lacquered gate!" But now, they could only curse in their hearts!
    Someone simply proposed: "Let's settle accounts with them! They can never finish telling us about the suffering they caused us! We don't expect them to pity us!"
    The masses wiped away their tears, and their anger focused on Zhao Jingwen. Guo Gelian first questioned him: "We suffer all day outside, what do you do at home all day? Smoking opium, aren't you?" The other party replied weakly: "Yes!" "Can you carry a load?" "No!" "Can you endure hardship?" "No!" "Am I, Guo Gelian, stronger than you or not?" "Stronger!" "Why did you get rich, and I got poor?" "I exploited you!" "My son and I didn't even dare to smoke a pipe, why did we end up with our skin peeled off?" "My son and I carried loads over the mountains day and night, 'sleeping curled up by the fire' at night? Burning into sores in the front, freezing into stiffness in the back, where did our sixty mu of land go? Where did the cattle and sheep go?"
    Zhao Jingwen had not even the slightest bit of capital to refute. He could only awkwardly ask one question and answer another.
    Burning with intense anger and the joy of victory, Guo Gelian became half-crazed. He suddenly lay flat on the ground and shouted: "My father didn't overturn the thousand-jin stone for me, Old Maozhu (Chairman Mao) overturned the thousand-jin stone for me! Old Maozhu is my father! I'm emancipated! I'm emancipated!"
    The masses continued to question him. Someone stroked Zhao Jingwen's face: "Where did this fat come from? What did you eat to get so fat?" Someone asked him: "Who painted your temple?" "Who gilded the mud statues?" "Why is it that when you worship the gods, they are effective, but when I worship the gods, they are not?" Someone pulled Zhao Weitai (Zhao Fengqi's son) forward: "Who raised you? Whose child are you?" The other party stammered and replied: "Everyone's blood and sweat raised me! I am everyone's child!"
    The masses continued to expose Zhao Jingwen's various misdeeds and crimes of serving as the chairman of the maintenance association, helping the enemy to commit evil, bending the law for bribes, and plotting to kill for money, calling him the "general cannibal insect" (chief caretaker) and "sixteen taels" (his crimes were enough). They unanimously demanded that the government execute him. And they asked "fourteen taels," "twelve taels," "ten taels," "eight taels," "six taels," and "four taels" (nicknames given to them by the masses on the spot) one by one: "Would it be a loss to execute him?" The answers were: "No loss, no loss! Even a thousand cuts would be too cheap for him!" The masses turned to Zhao Jingwen: "This is what you yourselves said! We're not wronging you, are we!" Zhao Jingwen's head was like a thousand-jin stone, and he never raised it again.
    Everyone calculated the amount they should return and compensate. The seven creditors should all become debtors. Because even their capital was obtained through corruption and plunder. As they themselves said: "We can't pay off everyone's losses even in another lifetime!" But the masses not only did not want them to be debtors, but also left them enough land and property to allow them to become "people" again. Even the "general cannibal insect's" family was left with three mu of good land to take care of his children. The masses said: "You wanted us to die, we want you to live! The suffering people are all saints! Remember that!"
    Someone proposed that they be asked to get guarantors. Everyone said: "More than a thousand eyes in the whole village can't keep an eye on these six people! No need for guarantors!" The "pardoned" said that they must follow everyone and become people again.
    The thousand-jin stone of the Tongtai Association has been overturned! The masses said: "It's like sprinkling cold water and sweeping the floor, so clean and bright!" But many people still couldn't help but shed tears when they mentioned the past. Guo Gelian put on his robe and kept saying to people: "Before, the landlord peeled off my skin, but today I've peeled it back!"

    “揭皮”
     ——晋城天水岭群众翻身记
    朱襄  林韦
    晋城天水岭村，以前有七户当权的恶霸地主。以赵敬文与赵凤岐为首，组成一个高利贷集团，也是恶霸统治集团，叫“同太会”，以贪污所得的粮食做资本，放粮食账。春放秋收，利钱是“一加三”，灾荒年达到“一加五”。每年往回收粮时，打锣下令，一律交齐，最宽的期限为三天。三天一满，就算你鸡叫交齐，也得加倍。群众称之为“鸡叫利”。
    小根借用同太会三斗豆子，到了期限，粮食没干，交不了；连夜弄干，打下来，送去，恰好鸡叫，连本带利非加倍不可。小根再三哀求，毫不宽容，他家赖以生活的四亩好地，就这样落入同太会之手。群众互相警告着：“宁可叫孩子瘦呀！不敢吃同太会的豆呀！”
    郭圪连家原有薄地六十亩，有牛有羊，只因孩子小，不懂事，在人家地里吃了个瓜，赵敬文把他吊在梁上，吊了一天一夜，罚了二百元，折成两个布，每个要三斤二两重。圪连买了来，赵用大秤一称，只三斤，不要；逼得他专跑到消化去买来才交了，交了也不行，人家要逐他出社！好话不知说了多少，才允许他摆八八大席请客完事。自此，他也欠了同太会的许多债，而且很快把土地、牛、羊，都落入同太会的血手。他和老父担山迈岭的受着，连旱烟都不敢吸一袋，但是赚的钱都填了“没底坑”，他一直没还清同太会的利钱。使他最伤心，最受辱、最难忘却的，是一件唯一的旧棉袍也被人家从身上剥下来，拿走了。他只在与同样的苦人谈心时才提这事。他说：“我叫人家揭了皮啦！”一提就掉泪。
    赵群太欠同太会的钱，该九月上利，自己估计怕上不到，三月就偷卖了房和地，想担挑几遭赚个钱，眼前也好顾嘴。谁知走漏了消息，同太会马上就来把钱没收了去（照同太会的“法律”，债户无权处理自己财产）。父母亲都饿死了，弟兄们偷卖了门板、炉子等，各自带着妻儿，半夜里呜咽着分了手，各逃生路（照同太会“法律”，债户无权私自逃荒），以后哥嫂侄儿们都饿死了。一家十二口，如今只剩三口了。
    天水岭一百五十九户，百分之八十是同太会的债户。经过前几年灾荒中同太会的加紧压榨掠夺，他们的土地财物大部分失掉了。一百四十五人逃荒走了，八十三人被活活逼死、饿死了。没死的人，吃着糠菜汤，瘦成了“见风倒”，夜里“弯火肿”（蜷伏在火炉上）穿的是“转过来”（没袖的破衣，可在身上旋转），苟延残喘，饮泪度日。
    与此同时，同太会恶霸地主们的土地却增加了好几倍，主动的维持了敌人，赵敬又当维持会长，依仗敌势，图财逼命，越发肆无忌惮了。已死的大恶霸赵凤岐，则在赵敬文指示下，经常毒打农民、一手逼死过好些人命。
    暗无天日的旧世界崩溃的信号，受苦受难的农民翻身的信号，终于在今年四月中传到天水岭来了！
    “清债！减租！有苦的诉苦！有冤的申冤！毛主席叫咱受苦人翻身、揭石板哩！”天水岭的农民们听着这些千古未闻的新语句，每个人都激荡起来，他们又惊又喜，半信半疑地互相传播着，一再向工作员询问，最后证实了，“是真的呀！”
    吃黄连的哑子们，人们从来认为“不会说话”的，现在张开嘴了，郭圪连说：“不是我郭圪连不会说呀！是千斤石板压得我不能说呀！”
    象黄河决了堤，农民们的苦水与泪水泛滥起来。纺车旁，碾磨边，家屋里，街道上，田野间，苦水和泪水从每个角落都倾泻出来，到处听得到女人们在呜咽，孩子们随着哭泣，老年人悲叹着，暴燥的人在气急怒骂。
    郭圪连在冬学里诉说他家破产的历史与生活的苦况，哭绝了气；赵群太哭他的九口亲人，尤其哭他的哥哥，整哭了三天三夜，神志昏迷，饭也吃不进。一个寡妇因为提到饿死的孩子，提到自己穿着“转过来”受冻受辱的惨景，放声大哭，不断喊着孩子的名字，谁也劝不住。一般人都无心做活：“给谁做呢？打下多少能够他们抢？！”被救活的郭圪连忙着：我“要闷死啦！”
    天水岭农民对同太会罪恶的大控诉在数天之后开始了缓和了些，由于过度的悲痛，又变成半疯癫的了，赵群太的控诉，已经不是在说话，而是一迭连声、上气不接下气的在哀号：
    “同太会呀！吃人虫呀！真狠心呀！把俺房子地土剥削完呀！想逃走呀！没盘缠呀！下门板呀！拆炉子呀！挖火口呀！卸楼板呀！白天不敢卖呀！半夜背着卖呀！卖了三升小米、半升黑面呀！半夜逃呀！塞住孩子嘴呀！半夜走到村外边呀！哥哥弟弟分了手呀！哥嫂侄儿们一去没回头呀！我的哥哥呀！爹呀！娘呀！你们死的真亏呀！”他喊得声嘶力竭，晕倒后气绝了。群众拥上去捏臂、捏腿、捏脖子，慌成一团，一个老女人闻声哀叫：“这不是同太会的世界啦！这是咱太会诉苦哩！你快醒来哇！”
    群众醒过来，继续哭喊：“同太会呀！真可恨呀！今天反了同太会呀！明天打了个黑枪也甘心呀！”
    群众淌着泪喊：“不伤心不掉泪！”“一人的苦就是大家的苦！一人的债就是大家的债”！“同太会好比千斤石！不打碎千石不能翻身！”
    根牛的娘哭叫着向同太会要儿子，猛力用头撞击着债主；另一个向同太会要爹娘的，拒绝了债主自愿的“赔钱”，嚷着“只有重生儿女，没有重生父母！我要你偿命！”群太也不要赔偿，他喊：“金银财宝我都不要！我要我一奶同胞！”一切索命的苦人，都在会场里嚷叫，哀号。
    一连六个人诉苦，六个都晕绝过去。同太会七个地主一并排低着七个头，极力想避免不看。但那绝不是“不忍看”，而是在惋惜失去了威权。他们从来只是厌烦的恶骂：“死了吗，活该！怨你娘没把你养在黑漆大门里头！”而如今，只能在肚里骂了！
    有人干脆的提议：“咱跟他们算账吧！他们给咱的苦永不会诉完！咱又不指望他们可怜咱！”
    群众揩干了泪，怒火向赵敬文集中起来。郭圪连首先质问他：“俺在外边成天受，你在家里成天干甚？吸料了不是？”对方有声无气的答：“是！”“你能担？”“不能！”“你能受？”“不能！”“我郭圪连比你强不强？”“强！”“为甚你发了财，我穷干了？”“我剥削了你！”“俺爷儿俩连口旱烟不敢吸，为甚落得连皮揭走？”“俺爷儿们白大担山迈岭，夜里“弯火睡”？前边烤成疮，后边冻成僵，俺六十亩地那儿去啦？牛羊哪儿去啦？”
    赵敬文没有一星一点驳辩的资本了，只能狼狈的问一句答一句。
    燃烧着强烈的愤怒和胜利的愉快，郭圪连半癫狂了。他忽然平躺在地上喊：“我爹没有给我揭了千斤石板，老毛主（毛主席）给我揭了千斤石板！老毛主是我爹！我翻身啦！我翻身啦！”
    群众继续质问，有人捋着赵敬文的脸：“你这膘是那里来的？吃甚吃肥的？”有人问他：“你这庙是谁漆的？”“泥疙瘩（神像）身上的金是谁贴的？”为甚你敬神就灵，我敬神就不灵？”有人把赵维太（赵凤岐儿子）拉向前来：“谁把你养大的？你是谁家孩子？”对方吞吐的回答：“大家血汗养大的！我是你们大家的孩子！”
    群众继续揭发了赵敬文当维持会长、帮敌作恶行凶、贪贼枉法、谋财逼命的各种劣迹和罪恶，直呼他为“总吃人虫”（总当家），“十六两”（罪状已够），一致要求政府枪毙他。并向“十四两”、“十二两”、“十两”、“八两”“六两”、“四两”（群众当场赐给他们的外号）等六人一一询问：“毙他亏不亏？”回答说：“不亏不亏！就是千刀万剐也便宜了他！”群众转向赵敬文：“这是你们自己说的呀！不是咱们冤枉你吧！”赵敬文的头象千斤石一样，再也没抬起来。
    大家查算了他们应退应赔之数，七个债主都该变成债户。因为连他们的本钱也是贪赃抢掠来的。正如他们自己所说：“再一辈子也赔不清大家的损失！”可是群众不但不要他们当债户，还留给足够的土地财产叫他们重新做“人”。甚至“总吃人虫”家里也给留了三亩好地，照顾他的孩子。群众说：“你们叫我们死，我们叫你们活！受苦人都是圣人！你们记着吧！”
    有人提议叫他们讨保，大家说：“全村一千多只眼还看不住他们六个人！不用保！”“被宽大者”表示他们一定要跟大家走，重新做人。
    同太会这块千斤石板揭掉了！群众说：“就和洒冷水扫了地一样，清亮亮的！”但有许多人，仍不免一提往事就掉泪。郭圪连披起自己的袍子，不断对人说：“以前地主揭走我的皮，今天我又揭回来啦！”
