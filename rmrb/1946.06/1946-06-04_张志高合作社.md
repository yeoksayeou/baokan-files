    Zhang Zhigao Cooperative
    The cooperative led by Zhang Zhigao, the production director of Xiyan Village in Yicheng, has recently attracted attention in various parts of Yicheng.
    Before the masses were organized, in order to develop the village's production work and seek benefits for the masses, he borrowed some money himself and bought a sow. The sow quickly gave birth to piglets, and he sold the piglets, repaid the loan, and made the sow public property. After the masses saw the concrete benefits, they formed a mutual aid group under the leadership of Zhang Zhigao.
    The group members each had their own family livelihoods and often had to go out, which affected mutual assistance. At the same time, they were also exploited by unscrupulous merchants, so they raised the issue of setting up a cooperative.
    At a meeting of the mutual aid group, it was officially decided to establish a cooperative, named Minjuyuan, with the aim of "supplying the living needs of the masses, helping to accumulate savings, consolidating the mutual aid group, and solving the difficulties of the masses in temporary expenses and having goods they cannot sell."
    The masses lacked cash, so he called on them to contribute materials as shares. The masses brought cloth, cotton, grain, wood, farm tools, oil, etc., to invest in shares. In a short period of time, 34,000 yuan worth of materials were absorbed. Later, the hunting team hunted seven wild boars and five elks, and also came to invest in shares for the cooperative to sell on their behalf, obtaining 70,000 yuan, which was used as capital.
    The capital can be withdrawn at any time as needed, and those who do not withdraw it receive dividends once a month.
    The masses had difficulties in preserving grain, fearing enemy raids and rat infestation. The cooperative called on them to store their surplus grain in the cooperative. Initially, mutual aid members and the masses responded, sending a total of 300 shi of grain.
    During the slack season, women wanted to spin and weave but lacked cotton. The cooperative organized the mutual aid group into a transport team to transport grain to the mountains to exchange for cotton and salt, constantly rotating, which solved the cotton problem, and women's spinning and weaving developed. The transport team also benefited, and the goal of preserving grain was naturally achieved.
    The cooperative also took out ten shi of millet and found a production member to specialize in transportation production. The money earned was not distributed as dividends but was used as a reserve fund for members to pay their burdens, making it convenient for the government to collect taxes and for the masses to pay.
    The cooperative sells the masses' produce on their behalf without charging fees. If the masses do not need the selling price, it can be used as shares.
    The goods the cooperative buys from outside are all needed by the masses. Whatever the masses need, they buy. Once, the higher authorities urgently needed military shoes, and the masses could not make them in time, so the cooperative bought more than 30 pairs of shoes from outside, solving the urgent need.
    When members buy goods from the cooperative or want the cooperative to buy on their behalf, they do not give cash, but only keep accounts. The selling price to members is the original price, and settlements are made once a month. Everyone feels it is convenient. The cooperative sells members' materials on their behalf, and if they are slow-moving goods, the lowest price is negotiated in advance, so the sales are fast and the business is prosperous.
    The cooperative members are also mutual aid group members. During the busy farming season, they are in the mutual aid group, and during the off-season, they transfer to the cooperative's transport team, maintaining continuous mutual assistance throughout the year. However, the transportation fees earned are uniformly distributed within the mutual aid group according to the number of workdays, and the cooperative manages the accounts on behalf of the group.
    The six employees in the cooperative (three in the sales department, two in the flour mill, and one in the transport and sales department) are given land to cultivate by the mutual aid group, and they serve in the cooperative in exchange for full work points. They do not eat in the cooperative, do not receive allowances, and have no personal expenses, all of which are in the nature of exchanging labor, so the expenses are very small. This is an important reason why the cooperative can prosper and everyone can benefit. (Taiyue Communications)

    张志高合作社
    翼城西阎村生产主任张志高所领导的合作社，最近已引起翼城各地注意。
    在群众还没有组织起来的时候，他为了开展本村生产工作，给群众谋利益，就自己去借了一部分钱，买了一个母猪，母猪很快生了小猪，又把小猪卖掉，还了借款，把母猪作为公有。群众看到具体利益后，便在张志高领导下，组成了互助组。
    组员们各有其家庭生计，时常要出外，影响互助，同时又都受奸商盘剥，于是提出了办合作社的问题。
    互助组的会议上，正式决定成立合作社，定名为民聚源、目的是“供给群众生活需要，帮助积蓄，巩固互助组，解决群众临时费用及有货卖不出的困难。”
    群众缺乏现金，他就号召用物资入股。群众拿上布匹、棉花、粮食、木料、农具、油类等都来入股。很短期间，便吸收了三万四千元的物资。以后打猎组打了七只山猪五只麋鹿，也来入股给合作社代售，得洋七万元，做了股金。
    股金随用随取，不取的一月分一次红。
    群众有保存粮食的困难，一怕敌人扫荡，二怕老鼠吃，合作社号召把余粮存到合作社，起先是互助员和群众都响应了，一共送来三百石粮食。
    农闲时，妇女想纺织没棉花，合作社就把互助组组成运输队，运粮食到山下换棉花和盐，不断周转，解决了棉花问题，妇女纺织便发展起来。运输队也得到了利益，保存粮食的目的自然也达到了。
    合作社又拿出十石小米，找了一个生产员，专做运输生产，赚的钱不分红，作为社员们出负担的准备款，政府征款与群众出款都方便。
    合作社代售群众要卖的生产品，不收用费，售价如果群众不用，即可作为股金。
    合作社从外面买的货，都是群众需要的。群众要什么就买什么。有一次上级急着要军鞋，群众一时做不起，合作社就到外面买了三十多双鞋，解决了急需。
    社员向合作社买货，或要合作社代买时，都不给现钱，只记账，卖给社员都是原价，一月结算一次。大家都觉方便。合作社代卖社员物资，如属冷货，则事先商好最低价格，所以推销很快，业务繁荣。
    合作社社员同时也是互助组员，农忙时是互助组，农间时即转入合作社的运输队，保持了经年不断的互助。但运输所赚脚价，要在互助组内按工数统一分配，合作社代理账目。
    社中六个职员（门市部三人，粉房二人，运销员一人），互助组给他们种地，他们在社内服务顶全工，不吃社里饭，不拿津贴，没有个人开支费用，全属变工性质，所以开支很小，这就是该社能繁荣业务，大家得利的重要原因。（太岳通讯）
