    Resolutely Implement the Nanjing River Management Agreement
    People Along the River Commence Work on Levee Restoration
    The project is vast, and there is a severe shortage of labor and materials. Following enemy disasters and natural calamities, the masses are without food or shelter. It is hoped that the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and the National Government will allocate funds for labor, food, materials, and relocation assistance for residents as soon as possible.
    [Special Dispatch from Heze by Our Newspaper] The JiluYu Administrative Office has issued orders to all special counties' river defense offices and sections to resolutely implement the Nanjing River Management Agreement, immediately mobilize the masses, concentrate efforts, and commence work on levee restoration. The priority is to repair the breaches and artillery holes in the levees, laying the foundation for heightening and thickening them. Subsequently, large-scale work will begin on repairing the large dikes on both banks. Before measurements can be taken, each county must increase the height of the old dikes by two Chinese feet and increase the width of the dike top to one zhang and four Chinese feet. Immediate surveys and reports are also required for dangerous works and revetments. Furthermore, it has been decided to convene a joint meeting of the heads of river defense offices and sections of all special counties along the river on June 2nd to discuss specific construction plans. According to Wang Huayun, Director of the Border Region Yellow River Committee, after hearing the news of the Nanjing agreement, the Border Region Yellow River Committee immediately ordered levee restoration projects to commence in various locations. Changyuan, Dongming, Juan City, and other counties began work on the 26th of this month. Reports indicate that the masses are enthusiastically participating in the work despite the busy wheat harvest season, with over 20,000 people already involved. However, the project is vast and cannot be completed in a short period, and there are numerous difficulties. Currently, it is the lean season, and food is scarce. The working masses are bringing their own food, including as many as seventeen kinds of sorghum, coarse grains, and vegetable husks. Due to insufficient nutrition, labor is greatly weakened. At the same time, there are very few houses in the villages along the river, and many workers are sleeping in the open, leading to outbreaks of seasonal diseases. It is hoped that the food and funds allocated by the UNRRA will arrive as soon as possible, along with medical assistance. In terms of the project, it is estimated that a total of 200 million catties of kaoliang stalks, 3 million catties of hemp, and over 600,000 piles are required. If these cannot be procured in the near future, it will be impossible to proceed with the repair of dangerous works. The production capacity of this region is limited, and it is currently the lean season, so it is necessary to expand the scope of procurement and transportation, and increase the supply of stone materials. It is hoped that the UNRRA and the Water Conservancy Commission will give priority to providing and allocating these resources as soon as possible to accelerate the progress of the project. As for the projects of repairing dangerous works, dredging the river, cutting bends, and straightening channels, these depend on rapid measurements. It is hoped that Consultant Tarde and Chief Engineer Tao of the Yellow River Commission can lead the measurement team to the lower reaches as soon as possible to assist in the measurement work and plan the projects of levee restoration, river dredging, repairing dangerous works, and cutting bends and straightening channels. Finally, Director Wang stated that according to reports from various counties along the river, the residents of the riverbed areas are extremely alarmed upon seeing the commencement of levee restoration and are crying out to the government for assistance in relocation. After eight years of enemy disaster and three years of natural calamities, this region is unable to undertake such a large-scale relief effort. It is hoped that the Executive Yuan of the National Government will immediately allocate the relocation assistance funds as requested by the Yellow River Commission to stabilize public sentiment and spare the residents of the riverbed areas from the suffering of displacement. It is also hoped that the disaster victims in the newly flooded areas of Henan will receive strong relief efforts.

    坚决执行南京治河协议
    沿河群众开工复堤
    工程浩大，工料极缺，敌灾天灾之余，群众食居无依。希望联总行总及国民政府早日拨发工粮、工款、器材与居民迁移救济费。                  
    【本报荷泽一日专电】冀鲁豫行署顷下令各专县修防处、段，坚决执行南京治河协议，立即动员群众，集中力量，开工复堤，首先将堤之决口、炮洞，修补完毕，打下加高培厚之基础。继则大规模动工修理两岸大堤。在未能测量之前，各县须按旧堤加高二市尺，堤顶加厚至一丈四市尺。关于险工及坝埽，亦须立即勘察报告。并确定于六月二日，召开沿河各专县修防处、段长联席会，会商具体施工计划。又据边区黄委会主任王化云氏谈称：边区黄委会听到南京协议的消息后，即令各地复堤工程立即开工，现长垣、东明、鄄城等各县，已于本月二十六日开工。根据报告，上工群众不顾麦忙，踊跃上工，现已达两万余人，唯工程浩大，实非短期内所能完成，且又遭遇甚多困难，现正处青黄不接、粮食困难时期，做工群众自带食物有高粱、杂粮、糠菜等十七种之多，因营养不足，劳力大为减弱，同时沿河村庄房屋很少，工人多露宿，已发生时疫，希望联总行总拨发之工粮工款，能早日运到，并予以医药帮助。在工程方面，预计共须楷料二万万斤，麻三百万斤，桩六十万根以上，如不能在最近期间备齐，则整理险工，无法进行，本区产量有限，且正值青黄不接之时，必须扩大购运范围，并增加一部石料，希联总、行总及水利委员会，尽速优先，供给拨发，以便加速工程之进行。至整理险工、浚河裁湾取直等工程，则有待迅速测量，希望黄委会塔德顾问、陶总工程师，能早日带领测量组来下游，协助测量工作，并策划复堤、浚河、整理险工、裁湾取直等工程。最后，王主任谈，据沿河各县呈请，各地河身居民见开始复堤，异常恐慌，纷纷向政府哭诉，要求资助迁移，本区经八年敌祸、三年天灾，实无力举办，如此大规模之救济，切望国民政府行政院，立即按黄委会呈请有案之迁移救济费用如数拨发，俾能安定民心，使河身居民免于颠沛之苦，并望对河南新泛区灾胞，亦予大力救济。
