[Report from our Heze office on the 14th] The militia joint defense of our YanJin, Changyuan and other counties is cooperating with the regular army to give the Kuomintang and puppet troops and their armed agents who are madly destroying the border areas a devastating blow. In these areas, since May, in addition to combining with local puppet troops to carry out frequent sweeps and nibbling, the Kuomintang army has also organized capable armed forces to cooperate with its lower-level special agent organizations to carry out long-distance raids, and many local people and cadres have suffered from their poison. On May 25th, a battalion of the Kuomintang 33rd Army, leading more than 1,000 puppet army security teams, attacked Wangdi and Weiqiu in Yanjin, and the people along the way suffered even worse destruction than from the Japanese invaders. Incomplete statistics from villages near Weiqiu alone show that more than 100 young men were arrested, more than 10 cadres and members of farmers' associations from villages such as Xiaohe and Zuocheng were brutally murdered, and 17 or 18 women from Xicun and Zhuang were raped. In addition to looting clothes, property, and food, the houses of the families of those resisting were burned down. In the above villages, the loss of each family was more than 100,000 border currency. The losses of the masses in Weiqiu and Wangdi have reached more than 2 million yuan. On the same day, more than 300 men from Changyuan He Fu Ji's unit, cooperating with Ding Shuben's security regiment, suddenly occupied Zhangsanzhai, and then searched door to door, shooting and killing most of the farmers' association cadres who led the masses to turn over a new leaf. These bloody massacres aroused even greater hatred among the local people against the Kuomintang reactionaries. The militia joint defense in the border areas had already been established and cooperated with our regular army to strike the invaders. In mid-May, the Changyuan militia gave the invaders a head-on blow in the battles of Xiaokou Guancun and Zhangsanzhai. In particular, in the battles of Dongzhuang and Mengzhuang in Neihuang, an invading battalion and two companies were wiped out, and their many attacks were repulsed. Encouraged by this victory, a strong militia joint defense has been organized more widely. Now, the militia in various border defense areas are guarding their peaceful homes with live ammunition, preparing to give the invaders an even greater blow.

[Report from our Weixian office] Recently, in the area bordering Xiajin, Linqing, and Yongzhi counties, the Kuomintang special agent organization's "assassination team" has been robbing, raping, murdering, and assassinating everywhere, and the people are suffering unspeakably, repeatedly demanding that they be struck. In order to rescue the people and stabilize social order, our First Military Sub-district specially mobilized two companies of soldiers, Linqing and Yongzhi detachments, and a part of the militia on the 17th and 18th of last month to cooperate with the Xiajin armed forces of the Second Military Sub-district to investigate special agents. As a result, 37 hidden special agents, nine long and short guns, and three vehicles were cleared out in Mati in Xiajin, Liuzhuang and Duti in Linqing, and Mengdian in Qingping. Among the captured special agents were Tan Yuxiang, the leader of the first assault team who held the letter of appointment from Wang Shuqi, the secretary-general of the Wucheng Kuomintang County Party Department, Zhang Baidu, who had overthrown our Liuzhuang militia, and Gao Chengyun, the director of the supply station (newly sent from Jinan). The main reason why this investigation was able to achieve such significant results was the enthusiastic participation of the broad masses. For example, the activities of the special agent Guo Tingdong were reported by an old lady. These criminal special agents are now on trial. According to the arrested special agent Shi Shoushan, "Gao Chengyun came from Jinan and conveyed the initial tasks of the recent special agent activities: 1. To contact the past puppet troops, traitors, and enemy agents to act in unison. 2. To try to control the joint defense of the masses."

[Another dispatch] The militia and local armed forces in the Xiajin and Enxian areas on the Jinnan border are actively encircling and annihilating armed special agents. In the early part of last month, the militia and district cadres in Cuizhuang, Wangtun, Wanchang, Mengzhuang and other places in Xiajin jointly encircled and annihilated the Kuomintang special agents hiding in the four villages, capturing Sun Yuting and others (including one battalion commander, two company commanders, and one regimental quartermaster), and seizing three long and short guns and eight hand grenades. A woodcut seal was found in the home of the regimental quartermaster Yin Chuanqin, with the words "First Regiment of the Fourth Administrative Inspectorate of Shandong Province" written on it. Since the establishment of the Enxian County Command, it has used the detachment and public security team as the backbone, and cooperated with the militia to organize two regiments, first carrying out key encirclements and annihilations, and then carrying out investigations by district. In seventeen days, the second battalion headed by "Pee Dog" (more than ten people) was wiped out, and most of Dong Huaixiang's company (six or seven people) was captured. The bandit Dong himself was also caught. The special agents Chu Yanquan, Gao Hongde, Wang Zibing, Jia Changhe, Wang Zichang, etc., who were sent to carry out activities not long ago, were all captured by the Sixth District militia.

    冀南冀鲁豫边防军民
    纷起痛歼武装特务
    内黄消灭特务一个营、两个连
    民兵荷枪实弹保卫和平家园，老太太报告消息清查暗藏特务。
    【本报荷泽十四日电】我延津长垣等县民兵联防，正配合正规军给疯狂摧残边沿区之蒋伪军及其武装特务以歼灭性的打击。此等地区，从五月以来国民党军队除结合当地伪军，进行经常性的扫荡蚕食外，又组织精干武装，配合其下层特务组织，实行远距离奔袭，当地群众和干部，不少遭受其毒害。上月二十五日，国民党三十三军一个营率领伪军保安队共千余人，向我延津王堤魏邱一带进攻，沿途群众，遭受着甚过日寇的摧残，仅魏邱附近村庄不完全统计，即捕去青年壮丁一百余人，小荷胙城等村干部农会会员十余人遭残杀，西村和庄十七、八位妇女遭强奸，对于抗属，除将衣物财粮抢光外，还将房屋一火焚烧，以上数村，每家损失均在边币十万元以上。魏邱王堤群众损失，已达二百余万元。同日，长垣何付岌部三百余人，配合丁树本保安团部，突占我张三砦后，即挨户进行搜查，将领导群众翻身的农会干部大部予以枪杀。这些血腥的屠杀，更激起了当地群众对国民党反动派的仇恨，边沿区的民兵联防，早已建立起来，配合我正规军，给侵犯者以打击。上月中旬长垣民兵在小口官村，张三砦战斗都给了侵犯者以迎头痛击，特别是内黄董庄孟庄等战斗，消灭了进犯者一个营和两个连，并击溃其多次进攻。在此胜利鼓舞下，强大的民兵联防，更广泛的组织起来。现我边防各地民兵，均荷枪实弹保卫着自己和平的家园，准备给进攻者以更重大的打击。
    【本报威县讯】近来夏津、临清、永智三县交界处，国民党特务组织的“暗杀队”，到处抢劫奸淫，屠杀暗害，人民不堪其苦，一再要求给以打击。我一分区为解救人民，安定社会秩序，特于上月十七、十八日，调集两连兵力和临清、永智大队及民兵一部，配合二分区夏津武装，实行清查特务、结果在夏津的马堤，临清的柳庄、杜堤，清平的孟店一带，清查出潜藏特务三十七名，长短枪九支，车子三辆。被捕获之特务中，有持有武城国民党县党部书记长王树齐委任状的第一突击组组长谭玉祥，曾搞垮我柳庄民兵的张百笃、兵站主任高承云（新从济南派来）等，这次清查所以能得到重大收获，主要是因为有广大群众的热烈参加。如特务郭廷栋的活动，是一个老太太报告的。这批罪恶的特务分子，现正受审中。据被捕特务石寿山谈：“高承云从济南来，曾传达最近特务活动的初步任务是：一、联络过去的伪军、汉奸与敌特，一致行动。二、设法掌握群众的联防。
    【又讯】我冀南边沿夏津、恩县一带的民兵与地方武装，积极围歼武装特务。上月上旬，夏津萃庄、王屯、万厂、梦庄等地民兵和区干队，曾协力围歼藏匿四屯的国特，俘获孙玉亭等十一人（内有营长一、连长二、团军需一），搜出长短枪三枝，手榴弹八枚，在团军需尹传琴家搜出木刻公章一个，上写“山东省第四行政督察专员公署第一团”字样。恩县自县指挥部组成后，即以大队与公安队为骨干，配合民兵，组织了两个团，首先进行重点的围歼，以后进行以区为单位的清查，前后十七天，消灭了“屁狗子”为首第二营（十余人），捉住董怀祥连（六、七人）大部。董匪本人也落网。在不久以前派来活动的特务褚言权、高洪德、绍义的王子冰、贾长何、王子昌等，都被六区民兵捕获。
