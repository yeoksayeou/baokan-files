Democratic Government Actively Benefits the People
    Gaoyi Dredges River to Protect Thousands of Acres
    Completion of the Chahayang Grand Water Gate in Northern Manchuria

    [Report from this newspaper in Xingtai] The first phase of the Gaoyi dredging of the Ji River project has been completed. A 15-li (7.5km) section of the river has been deepened by three feet and widened to 25 feet, using more than 70 workers. The Ji River originates in the western mountains of Lincheng, flowing through Zanhuang, Gaoyi, Baixiang, and Longping counties into Ningjin Lake. As the river enters Gaoyi, it becomes flatland and has been silted up for years. The riverbed is almost level with the ground. Every summer and autumn, when the water rises, villages along the river in Gaoyi, Baixiang, and Longping counties are flooded. In Gaoyi alone, more than 10,000 acres of farmland in villages such as Nantazhuang, Anjiazhuang, and Liucun are flooded every year. Dredging this river is a major part of the construction plans for Gaoyi and other counties this year. On the 18th of last month, the Construction Department of Gaoyi County Government hired Comrade Li, a water conservancy expert who graduated from a civil engineering school in Handan, to conduct an on-site survey. Construction began on the 24th and was completed in eight days. The people along the river were extremely excited, and more than 900 people participated in the work. Now, due to the busy farming season, the second phase of the project will be implemented after autumn, and it is expected to be fully completed by March next year. By then, the river will be deepened to seven feet and widened to 50 feet, and the perennial flood disasters should be eradicated. Furthermore, dredging is also underway in Baixiang and Longping.

    Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 11th: The Chahayang Water Gate, the largest water conservancy project in northern Manchuria, located in the northwest of Nenjiang Province, was constructed under the leadership of the democratic government, starting on February 19th this year. It was officially completed on April 30th, after two months of work. The water gate can irrigate more than 15,000 hectares of land. The Japanese invaders began operating this gate in 1940, forcibly conscripting more than 10,000 laborers every day. Their plan was to dig a main canal from Chahayang directly to Taizhui, with branches dug by villages along the way, totaling about 3,600 li (1800km) in length. However, it was not completed until August 15th of last year. In order to prevent the residents on the west bank of the Numin River from suffering from floods, and to alleviate the difficulties in cultivating 140,000 acres of paddy fields south of Chahayang, the democratic government actively started construction this spring, completing the water gate with two iron gates and four wooden gates, totaling 34 meters in length and 10 meters in height; a river dam 120 meters long, 6 meters wide, and 4 meters high; and two flood control dikes, one 30 meters long, 4 meters high, and 30 meters wide, and the other 80 meters long, 50 meters high, and 80 meters wide. A cement warehouse with a capacity of more than 60 million jin (30,000 metric tons) was also built. During the project, various difficulties were encountered: First, the struggle against bandits. At that time, bandits had not yet been eliminated in Nenjiang Province, and bandits often appeared in Beishan near Chahayang. Many residents could not bear the harassment and moved away, leaving nine out of ten houses empty. The democratic government then issued firearms to the engineering office and requested nearby troops to station there, so that the security problem could be solved. The people gradually moved back, shops reopened, and Chahayang became increasingly prosperous. Second, the struggle against economic difficulties. At that time, the entire project and the operation of water conservancy paddy fields required a total of 1 million yuan. It was decided to raise funds and proceed in stages. Some items that could not be solved with cash were replaced with physical objects. Third, the difficulties of the project itself. When the project started, the Numin River was still frozen, and the project was carried out on the ice. Later, as the weather warmed up, it was impossible to work on the ice, so a pontoon bridge was built to drive piles into the river from the bridge. Other difficulties, such as timber, grain, and cement, were also overcome one by one through the efforts of the democratic government. In short, the construction of this project cost 260,000 yuan, with an average of about 20,000 workers per day. The entire project took two months. Compared with the enemy's enslavement of tens of thousands of laborers for four years, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of workers and costing tens of millions of yuan, the two are truly incomparable. Currently, the democratic government has issued huge amounts of money to purchase seedlings, preparing to restore the cultivation of 2,300 hectares of paddy fields. The workers are also happily returning home to prepare for transplanting rice seedlings. At the completion ceremony of the water gate, the participating people showed unprecedented excitement, and the representatives unanimously praised the democratic government's achievements in serving the people's interests in their speeches.

    民主政府积极为民兴利
    高邑疏河保田万亩
    北满查哈阳大水闸竣工
    【本报邢台讯】高邑疏浚济河第一期工程已完成。十五里长的一段河身已加深达三尺，宽两丈五尺，共耗工七十多。济河发源临城西部山地，流经赞皇、高邑、柏乡、隆平等县入宁晋泊。河入高邑即为平原，连年淤塞，河床几与地平，每届夏秋水涨，高邑、柏乡、隆平三县沿河村舍即遭水漫，高邑境内南塔庄、安家庄、留村等十八村，每年必遭水灾，农田每年被淹没万余亩，疏浚该河即为高邑等县今年建设计划主要内容之一。上月十八日，高邑县府建设科由邯郸聘来曾毕业于土木工程学校之水利专家李同志，实地勘察后，于二十四日动工，八天即告完成。沿河人民兴奋异常，参加做工者达九百余人，现以农忙，其第二期工程决于秋后实施，明年三月可全部竣工。届时河身可深达七尺，宽五丈，历年水患，当可根绝。又柏乡、隆平亦在疏浚中。
    【新华社齐齐哈尔十一日电】位于嫩江省西北部，北满最大水利工程，查哈阳水闸，在民主政府领导下从今年二月十九日起兴修，历时两月，已于四月三十日正式竣工。该水闸可灌溉田一万五千垧以上。该闸日寇于一九四零年起，即开始经营，每日强拉苦工万余，计划由查哈阳直通泰坠之间，挖掘一条主干水堤，沿途各村分掘支器，总长三千六百里左右，但直至去年八月十五日尚未完成。民主政府为免使努敏江西岸的居民遭受洪水泛滥之灾，和查哈阳以南十四万亩水田无法经营的困难，本年春积极动工修造，完成了全长三十四米，高十米的两个铁门四个木门的水闸。长一百二十米，宽六米，高四米的江坝，长三十米，高四米，宽三十米和长八十米，高五十米，宽八十米的两座防水堤。并附带建立了容纳六万万斤以上的洋灰仓库。在进行这个工程中，曾遭遇了各种困难：第一是和土匪斗争。当时嫩江省内土匪还未肃清，查哈阳附近北山常有土匪出没，好多住户不堪其扰，纷纷搬移，十室九空，民主政府乃发给工程事务所枪支，并商请就近军队驻防，使治安问题得以解决，老百姓渐渐搬回，商店重新开张，查哈阳乃日趋繁荣。第二是和经济困难作斗争。当时计划全部工程和经营水利稻田，共需一百万元，决定分期筹款分期进行，有些不能用现款解决的，则改用实物。第三是工程本身的困难，当工程开始时，努敏江还在结冰，工程就在冰上进行。以后天气渐暖，冰上不能工作，就搭起浮桥，从浮桥上往江里下桩，其他如木头、粮食、洋灰等困难，也均在民主政府的努力奋斗下一一克服。总之兴修此项工程，用经费二十六万元，平均每日工人二万名左右，全部工程费时二月，如与敌寇奴役数万苦工耗时四年死往万余工人费资数千万元比较，真不可同日而语。现民主政府已发放巨款购买秧苗，准备耕作二千三百垧水田的复修，工人也都兴高采烈的回家去准备插秧，在该闸落成典礼会上，参加的老百姓都表现了空前未有的兴奋，代表们在讲演中一致赞扬民主政府为人民谋利的功绩。
