　　Unprecedented Misfortune of the Textile Industry in the Kuomintang-Controlled Areas
　　Xu Zhange
　　During the war, most cotton textile industrialists were abandoned in the occupied areas by the Kuomintang-controlled groups who fled at the sight of the enemy. They suffered plunder, destruction, and abuse by the Japanese invaders. The very few factories that moved to the interior at great difficulty suffered from the devastation of cotton yarn and cloth controls, so that the number of working spindles was less than 130,000. Particularly serious was the cotton shortage that had become nationwide. On the one hand, cotton production in the occupied areas declined due to the war and various forms of destruction by the enemy. On the other hand, cotton production in Sichuan, Yunnan, and other places declined because cotton farmers were exploited by low-price purchases due to the aforementioned controls, and they switched to other occupations. As a result, last year's national cotton production value decreased by two-thirds compared to 1937, causing the cotton textile industry to shut down.
　　However, during the eight years of decline in the national cotton textile industry, bureaucratic capital developed in this field. During the war, it already possessed half of the total capital in the textile sector, and the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Administration and the Military Supplies Department almost entirely controlled the private textile industry. After the victory, all the cotton textile factories that were plundered and monopolized by the enemy were completely swallowed by the China Textile Construction Company, a new monopoly cotton textile enterprise. Of the capital of the China Company, more than 60 percent was state-owned shares, and more than 40 percent of the "commercial shares" were wholly owned by the Bank of China (News Semi-Monthly, Issue 7). In short, it was entirely monopolized by large bureaucratic financial oligarchs. The business of the China Textile Construction Company was at least concurrently engaged in comprador trade and commercial speculation. American cotton from American cotton loans and other imported American cotton, American yarn, and American cloth (including parts of the general relief supplies) were all concentrated in the hands of the company as its raw materials and commodities for sale. The company set up a supply and marketing department, selling this cotton yarn and cloth and the yarn and cloth from private factories plundered by the Japanese invaders, which caused the Shanghai cotton cloth merchants to strike from May 7th to 9th. As for its speculative behavior, the exposure by the National Political Council in March of the company's leadership raising yarn and cloth prices to obtain huge profits is one example.
　　On January 19th, Song Ziwen defended the establishment of the China Textile Construction Company by arguing that it would replace the Japanese market in Nanyang. However, this has been proven to be a dream or a deception in the face of reality. Japan is still allowed to maintain 3.5 million spindles in its home country, and is now allowed to increase to 6 million spindles, and plans to build 15 million spindles in eight months (Tianjin Yishibao, January 13th, and Economic Weekly, Volume 2, Issue 17, May 2nd). According to Japan's domestic needs, only 2.5 million spindles are needed, so it is clear that Japanese cotton textiles will be exported in large quantities. In addition to Japan, India currently has more than 10 million spindles, none of which are competed with by the China Textile Construction Company.
　　In fact, the China Textile Construction Company only started 40 percent of its spindles four months after taking over, producing only 700 pieces of 20-count yarn per day, less than one-fifth of its potential production (Zhang Nu, "New Crisis of State-Owned Yarn Factories," Shanghai Wenhui Daily, May 20th). The fact that the China Textile Construction Company, which took over the latest equipment and owns more than 20 million yuan in assets, started with such a low quality proves that bureaucratic capital cannot develop China's industry. Because the essence of bureaucratic capital is not only stubbornly speculative and comprador as mentioned above, but also stubbornly feudal and backward. The China Textile Construction Company is also a typical example of the latter. There are more than 700 large and small staff members in the China Textile Construction Company alone, "completely becoming a bureaucratic organ, waiting for instructions every day," "real talents from various factories cannot be recruited, and incompetent people fill the ranks, but the general manager can arbitrarily appoint them," "constructive measures are not actively taken, and even mechanical equipment is allowed to corrode without replenishment" (ibid.). It is clear that such a bureaucratic comprador institution cannot develop production. On the contrary, with its overwhelming advantage in funds, technology, and companies, etc., especially with the turnover of a huge amount of American cotton loans, private manufacturers cannot compete with it and can only be defeated by it. This is the first crisis facing the current national cotton textile industry.
　　The second serious crisis facing the national cotton textile industry is the policy of importing foreign goods under the control of the Kuomintang bureaucratic comprador capital. After the implementation of the new foreign exchange policy, the power to manage foreign exchange is in the hands of the Central Bank, and the bureaucratic compradors demand whatever they want. They have a large amount of US dollars deposited in the United States, and they only need to send a telegram to the United States or transfer an account to the Bank of China to obtain a large amount of US dollars to buy foreign goods for import. At present, they have successively organized import companies and imported large quantities of American cotton, American yarn, and American cloth. The United States alone has shipped 600,000 bales to Shanghai from last November to the end of March this year. And the 33 million US dollar loan to the United States can import another 300,000 bales. The price of foreign cotton, foreign yarn, and foreign cloth is far lower than that of domestic products, and they only pay very low tariffs, making it possible to dump them in China at low prices and make several times the profit. Therefore, domestic products have no place in the domestic market, and currently domestic cotton is almost unsalable in Shanghai.
　　The third crisis facing the national cotton textile industry is the policy of unconditionally welcoming foreign capital by the Kuomintang comprador bureaucratic group. This crisis has begun to attack the national cotton textile industry, and it is undoubtedly a fatal blow to the national cotton textile industry. As early as after Nelson came to China, he formulated a plan to develop China. There was no heavy industry in the plan, and the main point was to develop China's textile industry. In this development undertaking, American capital controls more than 60 percent of the shares of various companies (see Nelson's paper: "China Can Help Us"). This plan to monopolize China's cotton textile industry is beginning to be realized with the help of the Chinese comprador bureaucratic group. In late April, three American cotton textile giants were planning to "cooperate" with Chinese compradors to open textile factories in China. It was also at this time that the new company law of the Kuomintang's Supreme National Defense Council was promulgated. The main point is that foreign companies that establish a general company in China are regarded as domestic companies, and foreign general companies that establish a branch in China do not have to operate in their home country. Recently, the Kuomintang authorities have also allowed foreign ships to unload goods in Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, and Hankou. The result of the new company law and foreign ships obtaining inland river navigation rights will inevitably be that foreign companies will be established in China, and foreign goods will flood the domestic market, greatly facilitating the realization of Nelson's plan to develop China's cotton textile industry, and strangling the last remaining breath of Chinese national cotton textile industrialists.
　　The cotton textile industry, which accounts for one-fifth of the number of factories, one-third of the capital, and three-fifths of the workers in China, is facing such a serious three-fold crisis, which is an unprecedentedly serious danger to China's national economy. For several years, the Chinese people's clothing has not been self-sufficient, and in the future it will be completely dependent on the United States. This lifeline of the national economy will be ruined by the Kuomintang bureaucratic comprador group.

　　国民党统治区纺织业的空前厄运
    徐展歌
    战时大部分棉纺织家被见敌即逃的国民党统治区集团丢弃在沦陷区，遭受日寇的掠夺、破坏、蹂躏，极少数冒极大困难而迁移内地的厂家，又遭受了花纱布管制的摧残，以致做工不到十三万锭。特别严重的，是已酿成全国性的棉荒。一方面沦陷区棉产在战争及敌寇种种破坏下衰落了，另方面川、滇诸地的棉产，又因上述管制以致棉农受低价收购被剥削，而相率改业。因之去年全国棉产值较二十六年减少三分之二，使棉纺织业不能不停机断杼。
    但是，在民族棉纺织业衰落的八年，官僚资本却在这一领域中发展起来。在战时，它已拥有纺织部门资本总额的半数，而花纱布局及军需署，又几乎全部的统制了民营纺织业。在胜利以后，所有敌寇掠夺垄断的棉纺织厂，复全部被新的垄断棉纺织事业的中国纺织建设公司所吞没。中国公司的资本，官股占百分之六十余，百分之四十多“商股”，又全为中国银行所占有（消息半周刊第七期）。总之，它是百分之百的大官僚金融寡头所独占。中纺公司的业务，至少是在兼营买办生意与商业投机。美棉借款的棉花及其他进口的美棉、美纱、美布（包括总救济物资部分），都集中的掌握在该公司之手，作为它的原料与供销的商品。该公司设立有供销处，抛售此项花纱布及日寇掠夺的民厂纱布，引起五月七日至九日上海棉布商的罢市。至其投机行径，三月间的国民参政会所暴露的该公司领导纱布涨价，获得巨利，就是一例。
    宋子文在一月十九日，为了辩护中纺公司的设立，曾以代替日寇在南洋的市场为辞。可是，这在现实面前证明是梦想或欺骗。日寇本国至今仍被允许保持有三百五十万纱锭，现又被允许增加至六百万纱锭，并计划在八个月中，建造一千五百万纱锭（天津益世报一月一十三日及经济周报二卷十七期五月二日）。按日本本国需要只须二百五十万锭，显然日本棉纺织品，将大量出口。除日本外，印度目前亦添有一千多万锭，这些都不是中纺公司所竞争的。
    事实上，中纺公司接收了四个月，仅仅开工纱锭百分之四十，日产二十支纱七百件，不到应有生产量五分之一（张弩：“国营纱厂的新危机”，上海文汇报五月二十日）。以接收最新式设备，并拥有二千余万万元资产的中纺公司开工，素质如此之低，证明官僚资本不能发展中国产业。因为官僚资本的本质，不仅如前所述具有顽固的投机性、买办性，而且具有顽固的封建落后性。关于后一点，中纺公司也是典型。单单中纺织公司的大小职员就有七百余人，“完全成了一个官僚机关，天天在那里等因奉此”，“各厂真正人才无法延揽，不学无术、滥竿充数之辈，总经理却可任意委派”，“带有建设性的措施并不积极，甚至对机械设备，任令腐蚀而不添补”（同上文）。以这样一个官僚买办的机构，显然是不可能发展生产的。相反，以其压倒优势的资金技术与公司等，尤其是获得巨量美国棉贷的周转，使民营厂商无法与之竞争，只有被它打倒。这是当前民族棉纺织业的第一个危机。
    民族棉纺织业当前的第二个严重危机，是国民党官僚买办资本操纵下的输入外货政策。新的外汇政策实行以后，管理外汇的大权掌握在中央银行之手，官僚买卖索取予求。他们本有大批美金存放美国，只须向美国打一个电报，或向中国银行划了笔账，即可获得大量美金，买办外货进口。目前他们已纷纷的组织起进口的公司，而输入大批的美棉、美纱、美布。单是美国从去年十一月到今年三月底，运沪已达六十万包。而三千三百万美金的对美借款，又可进口三十万包。外棉、外纺、外布价格，远低于国产品，又仅报纳甚低的关税，使足以低价在华倾销，获利数倍。因此国产品在国内市场无立足之地，目前国产棉花，在上海已几乎无人问津。
    民族棉纺织工业前的第三个危机，是国民党买办官僚集团无条件揖迎外资的政策。这个危机，已开始袭击到民族棉纺织业，它无疑的是民族棉纺织业致命的打击。早在纳尔逊来华之后，曾拟定了一个开拓中国的计划，计划中没有重工业，其主要一点，就是开拓中国的纺织业。在这一开拓的事业中，美资掌握各公司股份百分之六十以上（参看纳氏论文：《中国能帮助我们》）。这个独中国棉纺织业的计划，正在中国买办官僚集团的帮助下开始实现。四月下旬，美国三个棉纺织巨头，正在与中国大买办们计划在华“合作”开办纺织厂。也正是在这个时候，国民党最高国防会的新公司法公布了，其主要一点，就是外国人在华设立总公司，即视为本国公司，而在中国设立分公司的外国总公司，又可以不在其本国营业。而最近国民党当局又允许外轮在南京、芜湖、九江、汉口船行卸货。新公司法和外轮获得内河航运权，其结果，必然是外国公司林立于中国，而洋货更加充溢于国内市场，而大大的便利了纳尔逊开拓中国棉纺织业计划的实现，而扼断中国民族棉纺织业家的最后的残喘。
    占中国工厂数五分之一，资本数三分之一，工人数五分之三的棉纺织业，面临着如此严重的三种危机，正是中国国民经济空前严重的危险。数年以来，中国人民的衣服，已不能自给，而今后则将完全依靠于美国。这一民族经济命脉，将由国民党官僚买办集团断送。
