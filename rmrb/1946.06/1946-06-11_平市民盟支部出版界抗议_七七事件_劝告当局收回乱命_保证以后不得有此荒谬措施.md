Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th. The "China Democratic League News Agency, North China Branch" in Beiping reports: The spokesman for the Beiping branch of the China Democratic League, in response to the Beiping Municipal Government's illegal ban and sealing of 77 newspapers and periodicals, including the Beiping Liberation Daily, Xinhua Branch, Guanghua Daily, and Jina Bi-Monthly, told reporters: This absurd measure by the government authorities happened the day before Chairman Chiang, who had made four promises, arrived, which is truly perplexing. This absurd measure is a completely fascist, dictatorial act, without any legal basis. The authorities have no right to force the people to accept such illegal and unreasonable measures. We, standing on the side of the people, advise the authorities to immediately withdraw their illegal and unreasonable orders, restore all closed newspapers and news agencies, and guarantee that there will be no more absurd acts that infringe upon the people's basic freedoms in the future. We also hope that the victims will strive together, because freedom is not a gift; freedom is always a fruit that the people can only obtain through struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th. Beiping News: The Peiping Publishing Industry Joint Association, in protest against the Kuomintang authorities' order to shut down 77 newspapers, magazines, and news agencies in Peiping, and the illegal sealing of newspapers such as the Liberation Daily and Guanghua Daily, issued an urgent appeal, hoping for support from all sectors of the country and cultural circles in various regions. It pointed out that the Kuomintang government has repeatedly gone back on its word and violated laws and regulations. It questioned what laws this kind of action was based on, and declared: "In order to safeguard freedom of speech and publication, and safeguard the legitimate rights of the industry, we firmly advocate the realization of the following demands: (1) The authorities immediately withdraw their orders and restore the freedom of the 77 speech and publication organizations; (2) Thoroughly implement the four promises, strictly implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and the provisions of the Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction; (3) Abolish the registration system and thoroughly realize true freedom of speech and publication; (4) Guarantee that there will be no more incidents of destroying and undermining cultural undertakings organizations (including newspaper offices, magazine offices, news agencies, printing houses, bookstores, etc.) and endangering the personal freedom of cultural figures." The association also hopes that all colleagues in Beiping will unite and strive to achieve the full realization of these demands.

    平市民盟支部出版界抗议“七七事件”
    劝告当局收回乱命
    保证以后不得有此荒谬措施
    【新华社延安八日电】北平“民盟新闻处华北分处”讯：中国民主同盟北平支部发言人，顷就北平市政府非法取缔及查封北平解放报、新华分社、光华日报、集纳半月刊等七十七家报纸刊物事件，对记者发表谈话称：政府当局的这一荒谬措施，恰好是在曾经许下了四项诺言的蒋主席莅临之前一日发生，实令人百思不解。而这一荒谬措施，完全是法西斯作风的独断独行，没有任何法律根据。当局实无权强迫人民接受其如此违法理的措施，我们站在人民立场劝告当局，即日收回其不合法不合理的成命，恢复所有被封闭的报刊通讯社，并保证以后不得再有此项侵犯人民基本自由的荒谬行为。并望受害者一致力争，因为自由不是一种恩赐，自由永远是人民用斗争才能得到的果实。
    【新华社延安八日电】北平讯：平市出版业联合会，为抗议国民党当局勒令平市七十七家报纸杂志通讯社停刊，并非法查封解放报、光华日报等报事件，发出紧急呼吁，希望全国各界人士和各地文化界予以声援。指出国民党政府一再自食其言，违反法令。提出了此种举动，究竟根据何种法令之质问，并宣称：“为维护言论出版自由，维护同业之应享权利，坚决主张实现下列要求：（一）当局立即收回成命，恢复七十七家言论出版机关的自由；（二）彻底实践四项诺言，严格执行政治协商会议的决议，及和平建国纲领的规定；（三）取消登记制度，彻底实现真正的言论出版自由；（四）保证今后绝无任何摧残破坏文化事业组织（包括报社、杂志社、通讯社、印刷所、书店等），和危害文化界个人身体自由的事件发生”。该会并盼全北平的同业团结起来，努力争取全部要求的实现。
