Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 17th: New Delhi dispatch: After several days of tense negotiations, the Indian National Congress rejected the plan proposed by the British Cabinet Mission on the 14th for an interim government (i.e., a constituent assembly) in India. The Congress Party disagreed with the Muslim League having equal status in the interim government, and demanded to be in a dominant position. On the issue of the constituent assembly, the party opposed designating six of the thirty-four seats to the provinces of Bengal and Assam (where the Muslim League has a majority). The Anglo-Indian negotiations have now reached a new impasse.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 17th: New Delhi dispatch: Indian Viceroy Wavell and the British Cabinet Mission issued a statement on the 16th: It is suggested to form a representative national cabinet composed of fourteen people's leaders to replace the previously proposed party cabinet.

    【新华社延安十七日电】新德里讯：印国大党经数日紧张谈判后，已于十四日拒绝英阁使团对印临时政府（即立宪议会）所提之计划。国大党不同意在临时政府中与回民处于平等地位，而要求处于优势地位。在立宪议会问题上，该党反对将三十四席中之六席，指定给孟加拉与阿萨密省（回盟占多数）。现英印谈判，已陷入新的僵局。
    【新华社延安十七日电】新德里讯：印督魏菲尔与英阁使团十六日发表一项声明：建议组一包括十四位民众领袖的代表性国民内阁，以代替前次拟议中的政党内阁。
