Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st. Railway workers in the Pingjin area recently wrote to the Beiping Executive Headquarters, exposing the conclusive facts that the Kuomintang reactionaries are violating the armistice agreement's decision not to secretly transport troops, and are using the railway to secretly transport troops to the Pingjin front to engage in civil war. The letter stated: "In May, there were many military transport trains from Nankou on the Pingsui Railway and Tongzhou Station on the Pinggu Railway to various stations in Pingjin. All trains arriving at Huangcun, Anding, Weishanzhuang, Wanzhuang, Langfang, Luofa, Yangcun, and Beicang (all of the above places are on the Pingjin section of the Beining Railway) are for military use, because if they are not for military use, there are no trains to the above stations. Comrades have witnessed the Kuomintang army launching attacks on the liberated areas in the Pingjin-Bao triangle, and have personally handled military transport, and feel extremely uneasy. However, due to the railway bureau's secret order not to disclose this information, when the Executive Headquarters sent personnel to various small stations on the Pingjin section to investigate the truth about the Kuomintang army's military transport, comrades did not dare to report it. They are willing to express: If the Executive Headquarters can guarantee their jobs and personal safety, we will send representatives to testify to this matter in person."

Xinhua News Agency, Boshan, 21st. Our army recently discovered eighteen Japanese, including Chiharu and Haruta, among the puppet soldiers captured in Zhoucun and Zhangdian. According to Chiharu, after the Japanese surrendered, they were retained by the traitor Wang Yantian as ten artillerymen and machine gunners. Haruta and others were retained as senior staff members of the Nandong Light Metal Factory with preferential treatment by the Kuomintang. According to Zhou Shutong, they were sent by the Jinan Investigation and Statistics Bureau under the guidance of Song Yutian, and were in contact via radio, receiving assassination missions from the reactionary agent Song Yutian.

　　平津区铁路员工致书军调部
    揭发国民党反动派秘密运兵
    【新华社延安二十一日电】平津区铁路员工，日前致书北平执行部，揭发国民党反动派破坏停战协定中不得秘运军队的决定，竟利用铁路秘密运兵至平津一线从事内战的确凿事实。该信中称：“五月间有由平绥路南口及平古路通州两站开到平津各站之军运车甚多。凡开至黄村、安定、魏善庄、万庄、廊房、落垡、杨村、北仓等（以上各地均在北宁路平津段上）各站之车次，均为军用，因非军用，即无到达以上各站之车次。同人等目睹国民党军之发动进攻平津保三角地带解放区，并亲手经办军运，内心极感不安。惟因路局早有密令，不得泄露，故当执行部派员到平津段各小站调查国民党军军运真相时，同仁等不敢告发，但愿表示：如执行部能予以职业与性命安全之保障，我等将派代表面证此事”。
    【新华社博山二十一日电】我军顷在周村、张店伪军俘虏中，查获日本人千恒、阳田等十八名，据千恒自称：彼等自日寇投降后，即为王逆砚田留用炮手、机枪手十人，阳田等则以南定轻金属工厂高级职员为国民党优待留用者。另据周书亭供称：他们是受济南调查统计局所派来之宋雨田指导，专门有电台联络，接受反动派特务宋雨田给予之暗杀任务。
