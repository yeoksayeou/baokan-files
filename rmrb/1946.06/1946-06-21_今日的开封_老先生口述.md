　　Today's Kaifeng
    Oral Account by Mr. ×××

　　After Japan surrendered, the merchants and residents of Kaifeng City, in addition to setting off firecrackers and holding celebratory gatherings, looked forward to the arrival of the "Central Army," believing that from then on, there would be peace and they could live and work in contentment. Indeed, the Central Army came, and government officials came, but what they brought was not the peaceful and contented life that the merchants and residents had hoped for, but rather: (1) Distributing white flour to welcome the National Army: each citizen received 24 catties, with a market price of 80 yuan per catty at the time, but the National Army only issued receipts at the official price of 40 yuan per catty. (2) Painting doors and walls: Liu Mao'en succeeded the traitorous Bao Wen樾 as Chairman of Henan Province. His first order was for all doors in Kaifeng to be painted red and the walls painted gray. Of course, the masses did not bargain and had no choice but to obey. Indeed, after this painting by the masses, Kaifeng City looked better. On May 4th, after news spread that Bai Chongxi was coming to Kaifeng, someone said that Bai Chongxi was a Hui Muslim and didn't like red doors, so Chairman Liu ordered the red doors to be painted black. Again, the masses painted without arguing. Even the utility poles and small trees along the roads were dyed in a consistent pattern of red, white, and black. Needless to say, the roads were paved with yellow earth, just like welcoming an ancient autocratic emperor. Unfortunately, Bai Chongxi only stayed for one night before going to Zhengzhou to organize the civil war. (3) Numerous exorbitant taxes and levies: shop tax once a month, at one per thousand; banquet tax at thirty percent; prostitute tax, first class 200 yuan, second class 120 yuan, third class 60 yuan; parade tax (for those who visit prostitutes) at thirty percent; brothel tax (per brothel) at 2,000 yuan per month; entertainment tax at ten percent of the ticket price; entertainment venue tax at 600 yuan per month; large cart fee at 4,000 yuan per cart per month (called road maintenance fee, collected by the Highway Bureau); rickshaws 4,000 yuan every six months; income tax at five percent for everyone; house deposit 5,000 yuan per room; electricity deposit 20 yuan per bulb; and also manure tax, sanitation fee, in addition to entry and exit tax, slaughter tax, transaction tax, sea salt tax. Goods transported out or imported are all taxed, business tax, shop tax, and also surcharges, truly a world of taxes and levies! (4) Traitor Bao Wen樾, the pseudo-provincial governor who recognized the enemy as his father and sold out his country, is rumored in Kaifeng to have been declared innocent and restored to freedom. It is said that he was doing "underground work," and that he and Hu Zongnan were classmates, and Hu Zongnan vouched for him with his entire family. (5) The wives of officials were pale, emaciated, and modestly dressed when they first arrived in Kaifeng, but soon after arriving, their hair was permed, and then today they changed clothes, tomorrow they changed high heels, and the day after tomorrow they put on gold bracelets, glasses, and gold rings... These wives are not very graceful, and they can't walk in high heels, stumbling and waddling! But some junior staff members, although very busy, can't even get a full meal every day, eating two meals of red sorghum cornbread a day. (6) The Relief Administration provided 20,000 bags of foreign flour to Kaifeng City, but they did not distribute it to the refugees who had been displaced and homeless after eight years of enemy and puppet rule. Instead, they allocated it at 5,500 yuan per bag to "civil servants" and "schools." The clothes provided by the Relief Administration were also allocated to "civil servants," but these unpromising "civil servants" kept the good, wearable items for themselves and resold the bad ones to the masses. Please everyone, take a look at what kind of society Kaifeng is! Kaifeng City, the location of the majestic "National Army," is even worse than under the rule of the enemy and puppets. Heavens!!

　　今日的开封
    ×××老先生口述
    日本投降后，开封市商民除了燃放鞭炮、张灯结彩开庆祝会外，就是盼望“中央大军”的到来，以为从此便可以天下太平，能安居乐业了，不错中央大军来了，政府官员也来了，但带来的不是商民所想望的安居乐业，而是：（一）派送白面欢迎国军，每个市民廿四斤，当时市价八十元一斤，但国军只按官价四十元一斤开票。（二）刷门刷墙——刘茂恩继鲍逆文樾当了河南主席，首先命令开封全市一律把门刷成红的，墙壁刷成灰的，当然群众是不会讲价钱的，只好唯命是从。的确经过群众这一刷，开封市是好看了，五月四日，白崇禧来开封的消息传出后，有人说白崇禧是回回不喜欢红门，刘主席于是又下令把红门刷成黑门，群众又不讲价钱的刷起来，连马路两旁的电杆子，小树子都染成高低一致的红、白、黑三色，马路上黄土铺道当然不用说了，真和迎接古来的专制皇帝一样。可惜白崇禧只住了一夜即往郑州布置内战去了。（三）苛捐杂税名目繁多：铺捐一月一次，千分之一，筵席捐百分之三十，妓女捐头等二百元，二等一百二十元，三等六十元，游行捐（逛妓女者）百分之三十，乐户捐（每妓院为单位）每月二千元，娱乐捐按票价抽百分之十，娱乐场捐每月六百元，大车费每车每月四千元（名曰养路费，公路局抽），人力车半年四千元，所得税什么人都抽百分之五，房子押金一间五千元，电灯每支押金二十元，还有大粪捐，卫生费，此外还有出入境税，屠宰税，交易税，海盐捐，货物向外运，货物进口都得征税，营业捐，铺捐，还有附加，真是捐税世界！（四）伪省长鲍文樾，认贼作父出卖祖国的大汉奸，开封市传说他已宣布无罪而恢复自由了。据说他是个做“地下工作”的，原来他和胡宗南同学，胡宗南以全家保他。（五）官长太太初到开封面黄饥瘦，衣服朴素，但到开封不久，发也烫了，于是今天换衣服，明天换高跟鞋，后天换上金镯子，眼镜，金戒指………这些太太都不大争气，穿上高跟鞋不会走，一歪一歪好不难受！但有些小职员工作虽然很忙，却每日不得一饱，一天两顿红粮窝窝头。（六）救济总署救济开封市洋面二万包，他们却不发给被敌伪八年蹂躏流离失所无家可归的难民，以五千五百元一包配给“公务员”一部分，“学校一部分”救济总署发给的衣服他们也配给“公务员”了，可是不争气的“公务员”，好的能穿的自己穿了，不好的又转卖给群众了。请大家看看开封是个什么社会？堂堂“国军”所在地的开封市，竟比敌伪统治时代有过之而无不及了，天哪！！（冀鲁豫通讯）
