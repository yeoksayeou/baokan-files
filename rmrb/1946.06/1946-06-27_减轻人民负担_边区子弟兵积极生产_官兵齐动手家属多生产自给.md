　　[Report from our newspaper in Handan:] According to reports from various locations, significant achievements have been made in troop production work in some units this year. The production team of the 1st Company of the Jinnan Military Region Police Regiment, consisting of seventeen people, cultivated 400 mu of land in twenty days. Each company of the "43" unit planted around 100 mu of land, with the headquarters planting 100 mu of cotton. The Political Security Company of the Taiyue Military Region combined with the local masses to cultivate land. The "45" unit of the 15th Sub-district planted a total of 1,500 mu of land. The Taihang "Self-Defense" Unit seized and planted more than 30 mu of land near enemy and puppet blockhouses, simultaneously fighting the enemy and protecting the people's production. The production team of eleven people from the Special Service Company of the 15th Sub-district cultivated 100 mu of land and sowed 34 mu in one week.

　　Troop production in various locations not only involves agriculture but also expands into sideline occupations and handicrafts. The Special Service Company of the Taiyue Military Region bought 10,000 yuan worth of silkworm eggs to learn how to raise silkworms. The "45" unit of the 15th Sub-district opened two blacksmith shops, one spinning factory, and raised 114 pigs. The Jinnan Telephone Bureau cooperated with the masses to open a woodworking factory, making spinning tools and farm implements, with labor and capital sharing profits equally. The Wu'yi Unit utilized scrap iron to cast plowshares to supply the needs of the masses. The 1st Battalion of the Military Direct Guard Regiment jointly opened an iron factory with the people, manufacturing waterwheels, noodle pressing machines, and cotton ginning machines.

　　Utilizing spare time and surplus labor to participate in public and private production is also a new feature of troop production this year. The 1st Battalion of the Military Direct Guard Regiment cranked machines for the printing factory and transported bricks and tiles for the public, earning hundreds of thousands of yuan. The Zhanghe 5th Detachment organized a transportation team to transport coal. Squad Leader Ma personally drove carts and pushed wheelbarrows, earning more than 200,000 yuan in twenty days.

　　Organizing family members of cadres to participate in handicraft production to solve the living difficulties of family members is also an important achievement in the troop production movement this year. The production team of the family members of Guo Pin'san and Wang Yujun of the JiluYu Military Region "Zhi Zheng" has already been able to achieve self-sufficiency at the level of the troops' living standards. Their six family members, with four sock knitting machines, knit eight dozen socks a day, earning 100 yuan per dozen, totaling 240,000 yuan per year based on 300 working days. After deducting 110,000 yuan for expenses, they can still have a surplus of 100,000 yuan for profit sharing.
