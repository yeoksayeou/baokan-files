Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 17th: When our army liberated Jiaoxian city, the notorious big traitor Zhao Baoyuan, who had been entrenched in Jiaoxian and committed numerous evils, fled with his troops on the morning of the 9th. When he fled to the north gate of Jiaocheng, he was shot and killed on the spot by the attacking troops. The local people celebrated upon hearing the news. Zhao Baoyuan was a native of Penglai, Shandong. After the September 18th Incident, he organized the puppet Manchukuo army in Yingkou and entrenched himself in Phoenix Mountain, Dagushan, Andong, and other places to carry out "suppression" of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army. Later, Zhao was "promoted" from puppet battalion commander to the commander of the First Brigade of the Third Division of the puppet Manchukuo army. In 1938, he followed the enemy in "sweeping" the Jiaodong Liberated Area and suffered a serious blow from us in the Daqingyang battle. Since then, Zhao has continuously cooperated with the Japanese invaders in attacking the Liberated Areas of Jiaodong. In 1942, when the enemy carried out a "dragnet sweep" against us, Zhao formally accepted the troop designation of the enemy's puppet army. In his continuous attacks, he slaughtered countless anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians. According to Zhao's own confession in his so-called "War of Resistance Record," he killed more than 20,000 anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians. In Lanjiazhuang and other 73 villages in Laiyang, the names, dates, and months of those killed have been verified for 116 people. Zhao levied exorbitant taxes and levies in the areas under his rule. For example, according to statistics from the first district of Laiyang in 1943, each mu of land had to pay Zhao's troops 45 catties of wheat and 105 catties of miscellaneous grains, in addition to 115 catties of wheat and 100 catties of miscellaneous grains that Zhao's troops handled on behalf of the enemy. The masses could not survive, and more than 105,000 people fled to the Liberated Areas for survival. Due to their inability to bear such exploitation and trampling, in mid-February of last year, more than 10,000 people in Haiyang, Laiyang, and other areas rose up in rebellion against Zhao. Zhao immediately called himself a "small official" and, with "utmost urgency," telegraphed Nagano, the commander of the enemy's Qingdao Fifth Mixed Brigade, requesting "air force and powerful troop reinforcements." The Japanese invaders in Qingdao immediately sent aircraft and ground troops to reinforce Zhao, but they were all repelled by our heroic soldiers and civilians. Since then, Zhao retreated to Laiyang city. After Japan surrendered last year, our army launched an offensive against Zhao's stronghold in Laiyang to disarm the enemy and puppet forces, liberating Laiyang. Zhao fled to Qingdao and changed his banner, surprisingly appearing as the commander of the "National Army" Provisional Eleventh Division. Under the instigation of the Kuomintang reactionaries, on August 27th of last year, he invaded Jimo city, which had been liberated by us. From the date the ceasefire order took effect until the end of May, a total of more than 37 large-scale attacks were launched against the Eighth Route Army, using more than 10,000 troops. Zhao committed all kinds of evil wherever he went. During the second session of the second Jiaodong People's Congress held in April of this year, more than 3,300 letters were received from the people of Laiyang, Jimo, Jiaoxian, and other places, demanding the punishment of Zhao and the disbandment of the puppet army. This time, our army, at the request of eight million people and in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference on disbanding the puppet army, liberated Jiaoxian, purged Zhao's remnants, and killed Zhao, greatly pleasing the people.

    胶东人民公敌
    汉奸赵保元罪状一斑
    【新华社莱阳十七日电】我军解放胶县城时，盘据胶县之作恶多端臭名远扬的大汉奸赵逆保元，于九日上午率部逃窜，窜至胶城北门外时，被攻城部队当场击毙。当地人民闻讯，均同声庆祝。按赵逆保元，系山东蓬莱人，九一八以后，即在营口组织伪满军，盘据凤凰山、大孤山、安东等地，进行“讨伐”东北义勇军。后赵逆被由伪营长“提”为伪满军卫的第三师第一旅旅长。民国二十七年随敌“扫荡”胶东解放区，在大清阳战役中，遭到我之严重打击。此后赵逆在胶东一带，不断配合日寇向解放区进攻。三十一年敌人对我进行“拉网扫荡”，赵逆又正式接受敌皇协军的部队番号。在其不断的进攻中，屠杀了无数的抗日军民。仅据赵逆在其自己出版的所谓“抗战纪实”中自供，即曾杀害抗日军民二万余。莱阳兰家庄等七十三村，被杀之人民，有姓名年月可查者，即达一百一十六人。赵逆在统治地区，横征暴敛，如一九四三年莱阳一区的统计，每亩地即缴纳赵部麦子四十五斤，杂粮一○五斤，另由赵部代办缴敌人的麦子一一五斤，杂粮一百斤。群众无法生存，相率逃入解放区求生者，前后达十万五千余人。由于不堪受此压榨和蹂躏，于去年二月中旬海阳、莱阳一带，即有一万余群众揭竿起义，反抗赵逆。赵逆即奴颜婢膝的自称“小官”，以“十万火急”，电请敌青岛第五混成旅团长长野，派“空军及有力部队增援”。青岛日寇即派飞机及陆军增援赵逆，但均被我英勇军民击退。自此赵逆即退守莱阳城内。去年日本投降后，我军为解除敌伪武装，向莱阳赵逆据点展开攻势，解放莱阳，赵逆逃窜至青岛，即改旗易帜，居然以“国军”暂编十一师师长名义出现，并在国民党反动派的指使下，于去年八月二十七日，侵占为我解放之即墨城。而自停战命令生效之日起，迄五月底止，合计共向八路军大规模进攻逾三十七次，使用兵力万余人。赵逆所到之处，无恶不作。在今年四月间举行的胶东二届二次参议会上，曾接到莱阳、即墨、胶县等地人民要求惩办赵逆，解散伪军之信件达三千三百余件。此次我军应八百万人民之请，及执行政协解散伪军之决议，解放胶县，肃清赵逆残部，击毙赵逆，人心大快。
