Three Thousand Farmers Angrily Flatten the Eagle Tomb
Xinhua News Agency Shandong Dispatch

	Flattening the Eagle Tomb is a vivid and typical event in the struggle of the people of Shandong to turn themselves over. It not only enabled thousands of people in the Dadian District of Juxian County, Shandong to turn themselves over in this struggle, but also encouraged the fighting spirit of millions of people in Shandong. Now it has been compiled into a drum ballad in Shandong and will be passed down among the people forever. We record this typical event to let everyone recognize the true face of some local bullies in the countryside. (Editor)

	In Dadian Village, Dadian District, Juxian County, Shandong, there was a big local bully. His ancestors held several important official positions and specialized in embezzlement and extortion, acquiring 48,000 mu of good land. It is true that "the poor cannot be killed, and the rich cannot accumulate wealth," and the tenant farmers were oppressed so badly that they worried about the next meal after eating the last. They had to pawn their cotton quilts to redeem [illegible character]. No wonder poor families called him "Lord Yama of the Manor."

	Indeed, he was like a living Yama, setting up private prisons and training troops. Anyone who dared to say a word against him would not survive. "Lord Yama of the Manor" was used to playing the trick of seizing land. Whenever the wheat was about to ripen, he would find fault, drive away the tenants, and enjoy the ready-made benefits. When there was a bad year, the poor were so hungry that they could not even work, so he sent people to the countryside to lend money, ruining the land of the poor. He also opened a money shop, issuing his own notes. Taking money was one yuan for one yuan, but he would not accept his notes for buying his grain. Lord Yama of the Manor also ruined countless women. He even said triumphantly, "Women are like basins of foot-washing water, kick this basin away and get another one." Farmer Wang Wu was squeezed dry and sold all his land, becoming a tenant of "Lord Yama of the Manor," renting more than 100 mu of land. The grain he harvested was taken away by "Lord Yama of the Manor" through various calculations. He could not even afford to eat [illegible characters] all year round, and he had to work for "Lord Yama of the Manor's" family, doing hundreds of days of work a year. One morning, Wang Wu's son, Wang Dali, went to collect manure. He didn't pay attention when turning a corner, and the manure fork scratched the lime wall of "Lord Yama of the Manor" a few times. It happened to be seen by He Sanye, "Lord Yama of the Manor's" "watchdog," who immediately went in to report. "Lord Yama of the Manor" and the local militia came out together and beat Wang Dali until his head was bleeding. They also ordered the militia to take him to the plank room and lock him up. After Wang Dali was imprisoned, the local ruffians raised by "Lord Yama of the Manor" ate and drank all day long, and the food expenses had to be paid by Wang Dali's family. Poor Wang Da Niang desperately wanted to redeem her son. The family sold all their property, even the yellow dog. The family of four had no choice but to go begging. They were not allowed to take anything from the house. "Lord Yama of the Manor" locked the door and took the cattle away. This is called "the great wipeout" (just like killing the head of the tenant farmer's family).

	"Lord Yama of the Manor," having eaten his fill and having nothing to do, often led He Sanye and his eagles and foreign dogs out hunting. One day, Wei Laotou's chickens in Wangjia Village were caught and killed by "Lord Yama of the Manor's" eagles. How could Wei Laotou not be angry? He thought it was a wild eagle. Just as the eagle was about to catch the third chicken, Wei Laohan raised his bamboo pole and used his strength to kill both the eagle and the chicken. This was terrible. "Lord Yama of the Manor" immediately gathered the local militia and tied Wei Laotou to a tree, whipping him all over. Wei Laotou's old mother knelt beside him. It was as if she was being whipped, making her heart ache as she cried and begged on the ground. "Lord Yama of the Manor" ignored her and kept beating him until Wei Laohan was half-dead. He was also dragged to the plank room to suffer. After a few days, Wei Laotou finally survived. He cried all day in the plank room, but "Lord Yama of the Manor" forced Wei Laotou to sell his only three mu of land, make paper chickens and paper rabbits, hire eight musicians, and buy a coffin for the eagle's funeral. He also forced Wei Laotou to "wear mourning clothes and filial piety" and cry for "Eagle Daddy." Wei Laotou staggered along with the "Eagle Spirit," thinking of his own experience and the wolfish heart and dog lungs of "Lord Yama of the Manor," oppressing the poor. He was so angry that his heart was broken, and he sobbed and wept, tears streaming down his face. Which parent does not love their son? Wei Laotou's old mother fainted from heartache the day her son was beaten. She died of anger in less than a few days. "A dumb person eating coptis chinensis," Wei Laotou swallowed his bitterness and had to bury his old mother wrapped in a torn mat. The poor people in the village said, "Our lives are not as valuable as the rich man's eagle!" This man-made disaster forced Wei Laotou to go bankrupt and take the road of begging. But his legs were beaten so badly that he could not move. Wei Laotou endured the pain and held on for a few days. His skin was rotten and his bones ached, and his stomach was rumbling with hunger. Pain surged in his heart wave after wave. Seeing that his life was not long, Wei Laotou said to his wife and son, "When the day comes for justice, you two must avenge me and seek justice for me!" He died so unjustly. His eyes were still wide open when he stopped breathing.

	In 1938, the Japanese devils occupied Juxian County. "Lord Yama of the Manor" invited the devils to set up a stronghold in Dadian and became a traitorous district chief himself. Taking advantage of the power of the devils, he arbitrarily demanded donations and taxes. He was also afraid that the stronghold would not last long, so he asked the devils to sweep up the Eighth Route Army several times. Zhu Xuancang led the people to organize an anti-Japanese guerrilla team. "Lord Yama of the Manor" colluded with Xu Heizi, a Kuomintang county official, and assassinated Zhu Xuancang by putting him in a sack. He also confiscated the guerrillas' guns. When the Eighth Route Army learned about this, they could not bear to let the people suffer any longer. So, on a summer night in 1943, taking advantage of the moonlight, they fought hard all night and recovered Dadian, establishing a democratic government and implementing rent and interest reduction. When the evil "Lord Yama of the Manor" heard that rents were going to be reduced, he threatened the tenants, saying, "Rebellion! I have supported you for several generations, and you still want to reduce rents? Then I will definitely take back the land!" On the one hand, he pretended to be progressive and voluntarily rented a few mu of good land to a village cadre. But behind his back, he said to the people, "You are all working in vain. Look at that village cadre, he is only planting good land." He wanted to provoke the people to oppose the village cadres. But when the village cadre learned that "Lord Yama of the Manor" was causing trouble, he immediately convened the Farmers' Salvation Association to explain to everyone, took out the good land and gave it to the poorest people to plant, and also lent them farm tools and loans. "Lord Yama of the Manor's" trick was exposed, and the poor people said, "The current government does not oppress us like before, but also helps us to live a good life!" District cadres immediately went to the countryside to help everyone trace the root of poverty, to see whether the landlord supported the tenant farmers, or the tenant farmers supported the landlord? The Farmers' Salvation Association finally understood, "Grain is grown by farmers, cloth is woven by workers, and after working hard all year round, they are still hungry and cold, while those landlords eat and wear without working." Who doesn't hate "Lord Yama of the Manor's" tyranny! This time, when they heard that the district government was going to reduce rents, everyone decided to fight "Lord Yama of the Manor." It spread for dozens of miles around. One village after another, the tenants, holding flags, poured into the meeting place like a tide. How lively! The "Lord Yama of the Manor" in the center of the meeting place was so frightened that he dared not raise his head. The meeting began, and Wei Laotou's son jumped up and shouted, "I want my father!" He ran to Lord Yama of the Manor and grabbed his collar, wishing he could bite him to his heart's content. Wang Dali also jumped up from the crowd, pointed at "Lord Yama of the Manor" and said, "Your eight blows hurt me so much! They wiped out my whole family." As he spoke, he ran to "Lord Yama of the Manor," raised the eight-stick and said to everyone, "I don't know how many people this stick has beaten! Let's break it." Then there was an uproar. Some said, "He beat me sixty times, I want to get it back." Some said, "He ruined my sister, he must pay for it."... There were two or three hundred people vying to speak, all telling the grievances that they had not dared to say for decades. At this time, the fact that "Lord Yama of the Manor" acted as a traitor and oppressed the people was exposed one by one. "Lord Yama of the Manor" buried his head like a exhausted dog, panting and daring not to make a sound. When everyone voted to execute him by shooting, "Lord Yama of the Manor" secretly raised his head and looked up with the corners of his eyes. He saw countless flags and arms waving, which frightened him so much that he immediately buried his head. Thinking of his own destiny, which was only a moment away, his whole body trembled. But no one pitied him. After the struggle meeting was over, three thousand people demanded in unison to avenge Wei Laotou. The suona horns, trumpets, and gongs and drums sounded loudly, and three earthen cannons sounded in front of Wangjia Village. Wei Laotou's son led the young people, raising [illegible characters], shovels, you one shovel, I one shovel, in less than two minutes, they flattened the Eagle Tomb. The onlookers waved their flags and jumped up with joy and madness, shouting: "Avenge!" "Turn over!" When the Eagle Tomb was flattened, everyone clapped their hands and laughed like thunder. Then there was a burst of shouts: "Without the Communist Party, there would be no today!" This is the first time! We poor people have turned over!"

    三千农民愤恨平鹰坟
    新华社山东通讯
    平鹰坟这是山东人民翻身斗争活生生的典型事件，它不仅使山东莒县大店区数千人民从这次斗争中翻了身，而且鼓舞了山东千百万人民的斗争勇气。现在在山东已把它编成了大鼓书，永远在人民中流传着。我们把这典型事件记录下来，让大家认识在农村中一些恶霸的真面貌。（编者）
    山东莒县大店区大店村有个大恶霸，他祖上坐了几任大官，专靠贪赃枉法刮地皮，置下了四万八千亩好地。真是“杀不得穷人，积不得富”，把佃农压榨得好苦，吃了上顿愁下顿，当掉棉被赎＠头，难怪穷人家都叫他“庄阎王”。
    确实，他真象个活阎王，私设监狱，团练成兵，谁敢说个不字，就叫他活不了。“庄阎王”抽地，是耍惯了的一套老把戏，每当麦子快熟了就找岔子，把佃户赶走，自己好吃现成的，碰上欠年，穷人饿得连活也干不动，他就派人下乡放债，折弄穷人家土地。他还开钱庄，自己出票子，取钱一元顶一元，拿票买他粮食他不要，庄阎王还不知糟蹋了多少妇女，他竟得意的这样说：“女人是盆洗脚水，蹬了这盆来那盆”。农民王五给压榨得卖光了地，当了“庄阎王”的佃户，租种一百多亩地，打上的粮食被“庄阎王”七算八算折弄去了，自己一年到头，＠子熬饼都吃不上，还要给“庄阎王”家做工，一年要做几百个工。王五的儿子王大力，一天早上去拾粪，在转弯时没留意，粪叉把“庄阎王”的石灰墙划了几道，恰巧被“庄阎王”的“看门狗”何三爷碰上了，立刻进去报告，“庄阎王”和团练一齐出来，把王大力打得头破血流，还叫团练给拉到板房里押起来。王大力被押后，“庄阎王”养的那些地痞流氓，成天大吃大喝，饭钱都得王大力家拿。可怜王大娘一心想赎儿子，全家财产连黄狗都卖了，一家四口只好出去要饭。家里东西一点也不准拿，被“庄阎王”锁上门，牛也牵去了。这叫“大抹头”（就好象杀了佃户一家人的头一样）。
    “庄阎王”吃饱饭没事干，常领着何三爷和他的鹰、洋狗出外打猎，有一天王家庄魏老头的鸡，给“庄阎王”的鹰抓死了两只，魏老头怎能不气呢？他以为是只野鹰，正当那只鹰来抓第三只鸡时，魏老汉举起竹竿使了把劲，连鹰带鸡都打死了。这一下，可糟了，“庄阎王”立刻纠合了团练把魏老头捆绑在树上，用鞭浑身抽打，魏老头的老母在旁边跪着，象抽在她老身上一样，使她心痛得哭着，在地上苦苦哀求，那“庄阎王”一点也不理，还是不停的打，直打得魏老汉死去活来，还要拖到板房里去活受罪。过几天魏老头终算活过来了，他在板房里整天哭，可是那“庄阎王”又硬逼着魏老头把仅有的三亩多地卖了，扎成纸鸡、纸兔，雇了八个吹鼓手，买上棺材，给鹰出殡。还强逼着魏老头“披麻带孝”哭“鹰爹”，魏老头跌跌撞撞地跟着“鹰灵”，想起自己的遭遇，想到“庄阎王”的狼心狗肺，欺压穷人，直气的他心都碎了，呜咽啼泣，泪水直往下流。那个父母不痛他儿子，魏老头的老娘自从儿子挨打的那天心痛得晕过去，不到几天就被气死了。“哑巴吃黄莲”魏老头有苦往肚里吞，只好用破席包着把老母埋葬了。村里穷人都说：“俺们的命还赶不上财主家的鹰值钱呢”！这一场人祸逼得魏老头倾家荡产，只好走要饭的路，可是两腿被打得不能动弹，魏老头吞声咽气的苦撑了几天，皮烂骨痛，肚子饿得发响，苦痛一阵一阵涌上心来，眼看寿命不长了，魏老头对他老婆和儿子说：“到了讲理的那天，你娘俩要替我报仇，替我伸冤！！”他就这样冤枉的死了，一直到不喘气时两眼还是白白的瞪着。
    三八年日本鬼子占了莒县，“庄阎王”把鬼子请到大店安上据点，自己当了汉奸区长，借着鬼子势力，他就任意要捐要税，他又怕据点安不长远，好几次要鬼子扫荡八路军。朱玄仓领导老百姓组织起了抗日游击队，“庄阎王”勾结国民党县官许黑子，把朱玄仓装在麻袋里暗害了，又把游击队缴了枪。这事给八路军知道了，不忍得叫老百姓再受苦下去，就在四三年夏天一个晚上，乘着月色经一夜苦战，把大店克复了，建立起民主政府，实行减租减息。那万恶的“庄阎王”听说要减租，竟吓唬佃户说：“造反啦！我养活你们好几辈子，还要减租，那我非把地抽回来不可！”一面又假装进步，自动租几亩好地给一个村干部，可是他又在背后里对老百姓说：“你们这些是白出力，你看那个村干部，光种好地”。想挑拨老百姓反对村干部。但当那个村干部知道了“庄阎王”捣鬼以后，马上召集农救会向大家解释，把好地拿出来给最穷的人种，还借给农具、贷款。“庄阎王”的鬼计被戳破了，穷人们都说：“现在的政府不象从前那样欺压俺们，还帮助俺们过好日子哩！”区干部马上下乡，来帮大家追寻穷根，看到底地主养活佃户，还是佃户养活地主呢？农救会最后搞明白了，“粮食是农民种的，布是工人织的，一年到头出大力，还是挨饿受冻，那些地主们清吃坐穿”。“庄阎王”的横行霸道谁不痛恨呢！这次听说区政府要减租，大家决定要斗争“庄阎王”。周围几十里传开了，一村接着一村，佃户们手里拿着旗子，象潮水一样涌进了大会场，好热闹呵！真是人山人海，直吓得在会场正中的“庄阎王”不敢抬起头来。大会开始了，魏老头的儿子直跳起来高叫：“我要我父亲”！跑到庄阎王跟前一把揪起他的衣领，恨不得把他咬一口才称心，王大力也从人堆中跳起来，指着“庄阎王”说：“你的八棍打的我好痛啊！弄得我全家大抹头”，说着直跑到“庄阎王”跟前，举起那根八棍，对大家说：“这棍打人打的不知多少哪！给他折了吧”。接着人声鼎沸了，有说：“他打我六十棍子，我要捞回来”。有说：“他糟蹋我妹妹，要他偿命”。……争着发言的竟有二三百人，都把几十年来没敢说的冤枉事，说出来了，这时把“庄阎王”当汉奸欺压老百姓的事实，一件一件都揭露出来，“庄阎王”象只精疲力竭的狗一样埋着头，气息嘘嘘的不敢啃一声。等到大家表决要枪决他时，“庄阎王”偷偷的抬起头来，张起眼角往上一看，只见无数旗子和手臂在摇幌着，直吓得他立即埋下头去，想起自己的命运，只有眼前一霎时，全身抖成一团，可是人们没有一个可怜他的。开完了斗争大会，三千群众齐声要求替魏老头报仇，唢呐喇叭锣鼓喧天的到了王家庄前面三声土炮响，魏老头的儿子带领着青年举起＠头铲子，你一铲我一铲，不到两分钟，竟把鹰坟平毁了。围观的群众摇幌着旗子，高兴得发疯样的直跳起来，高喊着：“报仇啊”！“翻身啊”！等到把鹰坟平毁时，大家象打雷似的在拍手大笑，接着一阵高呼：“没有共产党就没有今天”！这是头一回啊！俺穷人翻身啦”。
