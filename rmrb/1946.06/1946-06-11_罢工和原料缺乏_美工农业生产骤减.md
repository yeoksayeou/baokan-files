    Strikes and Raw Material Shortages
    US Industry and Agriculture Production Plummets

    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: New York dispatch: US industrial and agricultural production has declined sharply. According to the Associated Press, the Director of the Production Authority stated: The coal miners' strike has caused a loss of $2 billion in production value. US steel production has lost 3.6 million tons due to the coal miners' strike, which, combined with the 7 million tons lost due to the previous steelworkers' strike, totals 10 million tons. The US automobile industry assembled nearly 800,000 passenger and freight vehicles in the first five months of this year, compared to over 2.1 million vehicles in the same period of 1941. The reasons for the production decline are shortages of raw materials and labor. According to reports from companies such as General Motors (accounting for 51% of total US automobile production) and Ford (accounting for 24%), each factory is often short of 200 kinds of parts, and there is currently no possibility of improvement, only being able to maintain one-third of normal production. Furthermore, Ford has once again suspended operations indefinitely due to a shortage of raw materials. It is reported that the US automobile industry averaged 3 million vehicles produced annually from 1939 to 1941. It originally planned to produce 1.6 million vehicles in the fourth quarter of this year alone. At the same time, the production of US-made steel rails, coal mining construction, etc., has also declined due to strikes and raw material shortages. The same dispatch stated that due to insufficient wheat before the new wheat harvest in July, 18% of the flour mills in the United States had been forced to close by the evening of the 4th.

    罢工和原料缺乏
    美工农业生产骤减
    【新华社延安七日电】纽约讯：美工农业生产已急剧锐减。据美联社讯：生产管理局局长称：烟煤罢工损失生产品，价值二十亿美元，美钢铁产量，因煤矿工人罢工而损失三百六十万吨，连同过去钢铁工人罢工所损失之七百万吨，则已达一千万吨。美汽车业，今年头五个月内，装成了将近八十万辆客货车，而一九四一年同期，则为二百十余万辆。生产低落之原因，为原料及劳力缺乏。据通用（占美国汽车总数的百分之五十一）、福特（占百分之二十四）等公司报告，各该厂供应品中，常缺乏零件二百种，目前无改进之可能，仅能维持平常生产量的三分之一。且福特由于原料缺乏，已再次作无定期的停业。按美汽车业，一九三九至四一年，平均每年生产三百万辆。今年第四季一季，原计划生产一百六十万辆。同时美制钢铁轨煤建立工程等，产量亦因罢工与原料缺乏而低落。同一电讯称：由于七月新麦登场前的小麦不足，至四日晚美国已有百分之十八的面粉工厂被迫倒闭。
