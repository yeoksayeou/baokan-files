    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: Moscow Radio today commented on the French and Italian elections, stating: Some foreign commentators, in assessing the French and Italian elections, declare that it seems the majority of voters in these countries favor moderate conservative parties and emphasize their loyalty to Western democratic principles and ideas. However, the results of the French and Italian elections contradict this statement. The number of votes obtained by the French workers' parties—the Communist Party and the Socialist Party—exceeded those of the Popular Republican Movement. Similarly, in the Italian elections, the number of votes obtained by the Communist Party and the Socialist Party also exceeded those of the Christian Democratic Party. The results of the French and Italian elections primarily indicate that the broad masses of Western Europe have decisively struck at the right-wing reactionary parties in the elections, demonstrating their unwillingness to return to the pre-war state. Secondly, the election results show that the people support progressive parties that firmly advocate democratic reforms in politics, economics, and society. The democratic front relying on the working class is constantly consolidating. In terms of political direction, Western Europe is following the path taken by Eastern Europe. This illustrates that the attempt by international reactionaries to separate Western and Eastern Europe with an impenetrable wall is unfounded. The second victory of the three French anti-fascist parties that organized and led the resistance movement, although some changes have occurred in the distribution of power among them (the Socialist Party lost some positions, while the Popular Republican Movement gained more seats), none of the other parties participating in the election obtained a majority like any of these three major parties. French bankers and trusts have tried their best to organize right-wing forces, attempting to restore the Third Republic, which represented the interests of the two hundred financial oligarchs of France, and promoting their domestic and foreign policies. However, French voters declared to them: We do not approve of your ways. The failure of the Italian reactionaries is also of great significance. When the Italian people gained the freedom to express their opinions after twenty years of fascist rule, they rejected the monarchy and voted in favor of a republic. Italian industrialists and bankers, relying on foreign aid, spent millions on conspiracies to maintain the monarchy. The election results show that the majority of Italian voters are determined to strive for a democratic life.

    苏广播评法意选举
    西欧走着东欧之路
    广大人民拥护左翼政党民主改革，
    不要银行家、托拉斯继续奴役他们。
    【新华社延安九日电】莫斯科今日广播评法意选举称：外国某些评论员估计法意两国大选总结时声明说，似乎在这些国家内，大多数选民赞成温和的保守党，并指出他们忠实于西方的民主原则与思想。可是法意选举的结果，与这种声明相反。法国工人政党——共产党与社会党所得的票数，超过了人民共和运动党。同样，在意大利选举中，共产党与社会党所得的票数，也超过了基督教民主党。法意选举的结果，首先表示西欧广大民众，在选举中给了右派反动政党以坚决的打击，说明他们不愿再回到战前状况中去。其次，选举结果表示民众拥护那些坚决主张在政治、经济、社会各方面实行民主改革的进步政党。依靠工人阶级的民主阵线，正在不断地巩固，在政治方向上，西欧正走着东欧所走的路，这说明国际反动派力图将西欧与东欧用一道铜墙铁壁分划开来的企图，是毫无根据的。法国三个组织与领导抗敌运动的反法西斯政党之二次获胜，虽然在它们之间力量的配置上，发生了一些变化（社会党失去了一些位置，而人民共和运动党多得了几个席位），但是参加选举的其他政党，无论那一个，都没有像这三大政党中的任何一个获得了多数。法国银行家与托拉斯，竭力组织右派力量，企图恢复代表法国二百家财阀利益的第三共和国，鼓吹其内外政策，但法国选民向它们声明：我们不赞成你们那一套。意大利反动派的失败，也是有重大意义的。当意国人民在二十年法西斯统治后，获得自由表示其意见的时候，他们是否决了君主制，而投票赞成共和制。意大利工业家和银行家依靠外国的帮助，花费数百万费用，阴谋活动以保持君主制，选举结果，表明意国大多数选民，都有争取民主生活的决心。
