Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Rome Dispatch: Italy's 28 million voters will cast their ballots today to express their opinion on whether to continue the monarchy or adopt a republican system, and to elect 556 representatives to the Constituent Assembly. This general election is of great importance to the future lives of the Italian people. On the eve of the general election, Italian Communist leader Ercoli issued a statement calling on Italians to "elect the Communist Party." He pointed out: "The Communist Party does not oppose a bicameral system in the constitution, provided that the bicameral system is based on democracy and that neither house becomes a haven for reactionaries." However, the Italian reactionaries, with the support of foreign countries, are mobilizing all Catholic forces, raising the banner of anti-communism, and actively trying to thwart the democratic development of the people. The new King Umberto is parading everywhere on the eve of the general election, actively campaigning for the dynasty. According to a Reuters report: his parades "have stirred up many wavering and latent monarchists." Italian leftists revealed: "The King's activities have stirred up disappointed former fascists." Umberto's campaign manager, Ruzziforro, said shamelessly in a speech on the 30th of last month: "Under Umberto's rule, people will be able to live and work in peace and contentment." Umberto's activities not only reflect the revival attempt of the Italian reactionaries and the remnants of fascism, but also reflect his foreign background. Italian democrats pointed out: certain Allied countries are "using the monarchy to manipulate us." The attitude of the Christian Democratic Party undoubtedly served the reactionaries shamefully. The party congress decided to support the republican direction, but allowed its members to vote according to their own will.

    阴谋复辟充当外国统治意人工具
    【新华社延安二日电】罗马讯：意大利二千八百万选民，今日将投票，表示他们赞成继续君主制抑或采用共和制的意见；并选举立宪议会的五五六名代表。这次大选，关系意国人民今后生活至巨。大选前夕，意共领袖爱尔科里发表声明，号召意人“选举共产党”。并指出：“共产党不反对宪法的两院制，其条件是两院制必须都建立在民主的基础上，任何一院都不能成为反动派的庇护所。”但意国反动派在外国支援之下，来动员一切天主教力量，打起反共旗子，积极活动，企图挫败人民的民主发展。新王安伯托在大选前夕，到处游行，为皇朝的积极而进行竞选。据路透社电称：他的游行“将许多动摇的与潜伏的君主派分子，鼓动起来”。意国左翼人士则揭露称：“意王之活动，鼓动了失望的前法西斯分子。”安伯托的竞选经理人鲁齐佛罗，上月三十日演说时，无耻的说：“在安伯托统治下，将可安居乐业”。安伯托的活动不仅反映了意国反动派与法西斯残余的复活企图，而且也反映了他的外国背景。意国民主人士指出：某些盟国正“利用君主制度来操纵我们”。基督教民主党的态度，无疑对反动派作了可耻的效劳。该党代表大会，决定支持共和方针，但却所凭其党员根据自己意志投票。
