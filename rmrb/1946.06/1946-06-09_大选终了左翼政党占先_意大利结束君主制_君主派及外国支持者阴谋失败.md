    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 6th: Rome dispatch: The Italian Constituent Assembly election has concluded. According to the Italian Ministry of the Interior's estimate based on 16.5 million votes, the seat allocation in the Constituent Assembly is as follows: Christian Democratic Party 195 seats, Socialist Party 123 seats, Communist Party 113 seats, Democratic Union 33 seats, Unified Party 26 seats, Republican Party 23 seats, Royalist Liberal Alliance 13 seats, Action Party 8 seats, Republican Concentration Party 3 seats, Labor Movement of the Forty-Ninth State 2 seats, Christian Socialist Party 1 seat, other parties 17 seats.

    The above figures indicate: (1) The most reactionary monarchists have suffered a more miserable defeat than the referendum on the monarchy. (2) The alliance between the Communist Party and the Socialist Party (the only alliance in the current Italian parliament) holds the most seats in the parliament. The Italian Socialist Party, led by its left-wing leader Nenni, firmly advocates close cooperation with the Italian Communist Party, while various contradictions exist among the right-wing parties. (3) The influence of the fascist factions and foreign open agents within the right-wing has not yet succeeded.

    Note: The Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party form the left-wing parties in Italy, with their influence mainly in the industrialized northern regions. The Christian Democratic Party, Democratic Union, and Republican Party are right-wing. The Christian Socialist Party, Action Party, and Republican Concentration Party are centrist forces, but leaning towards the left-wing. The influence of the above parties is mainly in central and southern Italy. The Unified Party is known as the new fascist party in Italy, and the Labor Movement of the Forty-Ninth State is a party that wants to make Italy the forty-ninth state of the United States. The above two parties and the royalists are the extreme right-wing factions, with greater strength in the southwest.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 6th: Rome dispatch: According to the Italian Ministry of the Interior's announcement on the evening of the 5th, the Italian referendum has determined that Italy is a republic, abolishing Umberto II and the House of Savoy dynasty that ruled Italy for eighty-five years. The referendum results are as follows: 12,182,855 votes in favor of the republic, 10,362,709 votes in favor of the monarchy. The voting results indicate that the House of Savoy dynasty is opposed throughout the country, and even Sicily and Sardinia, which were initially thought to support the dynasty, supported the republic. Turin, the historical base of the House of Savoy dynasty, also saw a slight advantage for the republicans. Venice, a historically famous place since the annexation of Italy by Austria, cast 80% of its votes for the republic. Predappio near Forlì in northern Italy, the birthplace of Mussolini, saw most people not only vote for the republic, but also for the Communist Party. Rome cast 60% of its votes for the republic. According to the United Press, the above situation was unexpected by the monarchists and some foreign observers. The voting result has ended the reign of Umberto II, who announced that he would leave the country within days. Therefore, Umberto's reign since he proclaimed himself King of Italy lasted only sixteen days, making him the shortest-reigning emperor in world history. Umberto's ascension to the throne was an important conspiracy action by the monarchists to defeat the republicans before the referendum. In view of the notorious reputation of Umberto's father, Victor Emmanuel, for being pro-fascist, the monarchists supported Umberto's succession in an attempt to save the dynasty from disaster. The results of the citizens' vote indicate that the conspiracy of the reactionary monarchist forces and foreign supporters in Italy has finally failed.

    大选终了左翼政党占先
    意大利结束君主制
    君主派及外国支持者阴谋失败
    【新华社延安六日电】罗马讯：意立宪议会选举已结束。据意内政部根据一千六百五十万张选票估计，立宪议会的席位分配如下：基督教民主党一九五席，社会党一二三席，共产党一一三席，民主联盟三十三席，统一党二十六席，共和党二十三，保皇自由联盟十三席，行动党八席，共和集中党三席，第四十九州职工运动者二席，基督教社会党一席，其他党派十七席。
    以上数字表示：（１）最反动的君主派，已遭到较王朝复决更惨的失败。（２）共产党与社会党的联盟（目前意议会中的唯一联盟）席数，居议会的第一位。意社会党以该党左派领袖南尼为首，坚主与意共密切合作，右翼各党间，则存在各种矛盾。（３）右翼中的法西斯派，及外国公开代理人的势力、仍未得意。        
    按：意共产党与社会党形成意大利的左翼政党，其势力主要在工业发达的北部地区。基督教民主党、民主联盟、共和党为右翼。基督教社会党、行动党、共和集中党为中间势力，但靠近左翼。以上诸党的势力，主要在中部及南部。统一党在意国被号称为新法西斯党，第四十九州职工运动欲使意大利成为美国第四十九州的党派。以上两党与保皇派为右翼中的极端派，在西南部的力量较大。
    【新华社延安六日电】罗马讯：据意内政部五日晚间公告：意公民投票，已表决意大利为共和国，废除安伯托二世及统治意国八十五年的萨伏衣王朝。复决票数如下：赞成共和者一二、一八二、八五五票，赞成君主制者一○、三六二、七○九票。投票情形表示，萨伏衣王朝在全国范围内遭到反对，甚至起先被认为将支持王朝的西西里与撒丁岛亦拥护共和制。萨伏衣王朝的历史策源地都灵，共和派亦略见优势。萨伏衣王朝自奥国并入意大利后之历史名地威尼斯，百分之八十投共和票。墨索里尼的出生——北意佛尔里附近的普利达彼奥，大部分人不仅投共和票，且投共产党票。罗马百分之六十投共和票。据合众社称：以上情形，出乎君主派及若干外国观察家之意料，投票结果已结束了安伯托二世的统治，他宣告将于日内出国，因而安伯托自封为意王以来，在位仅十六日，为全世界历史最短的皇帝。按安伯托的登基，是君主派在复决前企图战胜共和派的重要阴谋行动。鉴于安伯托之父爱麦虞限因亲法西斯而声名狼藉，君主派乃拥安伯托接位，企图挽回王朝厄运。公民表决结果，表示意大利反动势力君主派及外国支持者的阴谋已最后失败。
