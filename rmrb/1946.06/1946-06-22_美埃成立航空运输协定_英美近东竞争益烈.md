　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: Washington dispatch: Following the Anglo-Egyptian air agreement, the US State Department announced on the 15th that the US Minister to Egypt and the Egyptian authorities had signed an air transport agreement in Cairo, as well as an agreement on governing the US surplus materials in Egypt. The agreement also includes provisions for US military aircraft flying within Egyptian territory and an agreement on the use of Cairo's Payne Field airport. According to the agreement, the US has sold ten million US dollars worth of surplus materials to Egypt. The Anglo-Egyptian air agreement was signed last month, with Britain aiming to control Egyptian aviation. The US's subsequent signing of this agreement with Egypt demonstrates that the US is eager to compete with Britain in Egypt.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: Jerusalem dispatch: Officials announced that, starting from the 19th, the entire city of Tel Aviv has become a British military exclusion zone. At the same time, Jerusalem and Haifa have also been placed under martial law because five British military officers, including four from the army and one from the air force, were kidnapped by Jewish terrorists at an officers' club in Tel Aviv on the 18th. On the same day, in Jerusalem, two British majors were shot by unknown assassins.
