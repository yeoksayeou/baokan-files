    "The day to settle accounts with Lu Wanshou is coming on the 30th!" The masses in the suburbs of Handan had been spreading this joyous news for the past few days. Many people came into the city from the countryside to inquire about the date of the reckoning, preparing to vent their anger properly. The merchants, in order to unite in anti-traitorous revenge, were "networking" until late at night on the 29th.

    "I want to see with my own eyes how he dies!" Ding Xiao, a woman from Dongmenli, went to burn paper money for her mother in the countryside, and fearing she would be late for this day, hurriedly rushed back the same day. The masses in Wulipu cooked in the middle of the night, preparing to get up at dawn to attend the meeting.

    On the 30th, as soon as it dawned, the cadres of the Businessmen's Association Preparatory Committee gathered representatives from all walks of life, and the shop assistants, while taking down the door planks, greeted each other to hurry up and participate in the meeting - the joint anti-traitorous revenge meeting of businessmen and citizens (Businessmen's Association and Citizens' Association) of Handan City.

    This anti-traitor struggle broke out of the past narrow circles, and people from all levels and walks of life in the city participated in the struggle. Men and women, old and young, those in long robes and short jackets, in queues, and scattered around, six or seven thousand people gathered excitedly and joyfully in the sports field. Because the dark days were past, they believed that the democratic government would surely stand up for the people.

    "Down with the traitor Lu Wanshou!"

    "Businessmen and citizens unite to fight traitors and seek revenge!" More than three thousand members of the Businessmen's Association shouted slogans.

    "People from all circles of industry, commerce, and agriculture unite to settle accounts with the traitor and spy Lu Wanshou!" The citizen members also shouted.

    As the traitor Lu Wanshou was brought to the stage by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, he was crowded by one or two thousand people behind him, each gnashing their teeth, rubbing their fists, and millions of angry eyes staring straight at Lu Wanshou. After a moment of silence, a cry of "Tell your grievances!" The masses began to pour out eight years of bitterness, starting with the owner of the Xinhua Theater who said: "Lu Wanshou brought eighteen prostitutes to watch a play. I didn't recognize him and asked him for a 'ticket,' and he slapped a tooth out of my mouth! And he took out a gun to shoot me, and even though we all knelt down and begged him, he wouldn't let up." "Another time, Lu Wanshou wore his hat crookedly and walked backstage. The staff didn't recognize him, and he opened his mouth and cursed, saying, 'Damn it, why didn't you stand up when you saw Master Lu? Are you blind? Don't you know that the one wearing the hat crookedly is me?'" He then slapped each of the backstage staff, men and women, four times in the face. The manager of Yufeng Flower Shop said: "Lu Wanshou extorted three thousand yuan from his shop." A small vendor said: "I sold cigarettes. He smoked them without paying, and said that I was communicating with the Eighth Route Army and wanted to electrocute me! As a result, I sold all my goods and gave him 60,000 yuan before it was over." The masses below shouted in unison, "Beat him, beat this bastard to death!" The peddler slapped him in the face, and the crowd shouted, "Lightly! Beat him hard; beat him to death!" Rickshaw puller Chen An said: "Lu Wanshou took my rickshaw to a brothel (prostitute). He went inside and didn't come out. In the cold weather of the twelfth lunar month, he made me squat outside the door, cold and hungry, waiting all night. The next morning he still didn't come out. I went back to eat and pulled someone else for a ride. Lu Wanshou saw it, kicked the rickshaw over, and beat me severely." A wave of shouts of "Revenge for grievances, revenge for wrongs" arose below. An old storyteller said with tears in her eyes: "The year before last, in the winter, my two daughters and I were telling stories in the storytelling hall. Lu Wanshou called us to the special agent team. We sang eight segments of the story for him without eating, and he didn't give us a penny. In the middle of the night, he forced me to leave, leaving my two daughters overnight. I said: 'The children are ignorant. One is thirteen and the other is only twelve. Please forgive me, Master Lu!' He kicked me over and beat me. The two daughters were so frightened that they cried and screamed! Later, I risked my old life and said, 'Who doesn't have a sister? If you want to take my daughters, kill me first!' Fortunately, others interceded, and we were able to go back. The two daughters were also frightened and fell ill, crying and talking nonsense all day long! 'Lu Wanshou is coming! Mom! I'm scared!'" A prostitute (now reformed) from the time before Handan's liberation said with tears in her eyes: "We were already miserable enough! But Lu Wanshou never paid for the session, and never paid for the accommodation. Once, he went to our group during the day and made all the girls (prostitutes) take off their pants for him to see. He and the agent Li Bingchen stayed in the room, one having sex with the girl and the other watching, and they even took pictures. When he got angry, he told the girls to kneel on the ground all night without wearing clothes. Or kneel on the snow in the yard. Another time, he stripped four of us girls naked and told us to crawl under the table. He took off his clothes, squatted on the table, and urinated on our heads. Whoever moved would be beaten...." Her tears fell on her clothes. Before everyone could finish speaking, the masses constantly raised their fists and shouted angrily, "Eliminate this inhuman thing!" "Demand that the government execute the traitor Lu Wanshou!" "The government must answer the demands of the masses!"

    Mayor Wang stood up to answer the people, and everyone watched with nervous anticipation.

    "...In the past, it was a time when traitors and special agents ran rampant. Today is the time for the people to redress their grievances and seek revenge against traitors and special agents. The world has changed. The government accepts the demands of the people and has already passed court trials and the approval of the High Court to execute the traitor Lu Wanshou by shooting!" Mayor Wang said decisively.

    As soon as Mayor Wang's words came out, the masses cheered and rushed him out until they saw him fall into a pool of blood, and then people clapped their hands and breathed a sigh of relief.

    People crowded to see his corpse, and couldn't help but think of a cartoon at the entrance of the venue: When he and the traitor Li Jiyu shot and killed eleven comrades of the Eighth Route Army, the last comrade Sun solemnly warned him: "Don't forget that one day you will be punished by the Chinese people!"

    "Really, you have this day!" The masses recalled from the bottom of their hearts the eleven Eighth Route Army comrades who died for the nation, and at the same time cursed the traitor Lu Wanshou while gnashing their teeth.

    人民的裁判
    ——邯郸六千群众斗争汉奸卢万寿特写

    “三十日要和卢万寿算总账了!”邯郸城郊区群众，前几天就互相传着这喜悦的消息，许多人从乡下进城打听算账的日子，准备着要好好的出口气。商人们为了联合反奸复仇，二十九日一直“串连”到深夜。
    “我要亲眼看看他怎样死？！”东门里妇女丁小对下乡去给她娘烧纸，生怕耽误了这一天，急忙忙的当天又赶了回来。五里铺群众半夜就作饭，准备起五更参加大会。
    三十日天刚亮，商联筹备会的干部们就该处召集各行各业集合，伙计们一面下着门板，一面互相招呼着快弄好去参加大会——邯郸市商人、市民（商联会和市民会）联合反奸复仇大会。
    这次的反奸斗争，走出了过去的狭小圈子，全市各阶层、各界人民都参加了斗争。男的女的，老的小的，穿长袍短褂的，排队的，零散的，六七千群众都兴奋而喜悦的在运动场里集聚起来。因为阴暗的日子已成过去，他们相信民主政府一定会给人民作主。
    “打倒汉奸卢万寿！”
    “商人和市民联合起来反奸复仇！”三千多商联会员在喊口号。
    “农工商各界团结起来，和汉奸特务卢万寿算总账！”市民会员们也叫开了。
    当汉奸卢万寿由市公安局提出走向台上时，他身后拥挤着一两千群众，个个咬牙切齿，摩拳擦掌，千万双愤怒的眼睛直盯着卢万寿。经过一霎时的沉默，一声“诉苦”！群众便开始倾倒八年的苦水，先由新华戏园老板诉说：“卢万寿带着十八个妓女来瞧戏，我不认识他，问他“票”，便被他一耳光打掉我一个牙！并拿出手枪要崩我，俺几个人给他跪着也不饶”。“又有一次，卢万寿歪戴着帽走到后台，伙计们不认识他，他开口就骂妈的，见了卢五爷，为啥不站起来，你们真瞎眼，不知道歪戴着帽的是我吗？”说着把后台的伙计们，不分男女每人打了四个耳光子。”裕丰花店经理说：“卢万寿勒索他柜上款项三千元。”一个小摊贩说：“我卖纸烟，他抽了不给钱，又说俺通八路，要给俺过电！结果俺把全部货物卖净给了他六万元才算没事。”下边群众一致的乱喊“打，打死这个坏蛋！”小贩揍他耳光子，群众喊着“轻！狠打；打死他！”洋车夫陈安说：“卢万寿坐着我的车去逛窑子（妓女），他进去不出来，腊月天气，叫俺连冷带饿的蹲在门外等，冻了一夜，第二天早起他还不出来，俺回去吃饭，拉了别人个坐，被卢万寿看见，一脚把车子踢翻，把俺狠狠揍一顿。”下边掀起一阵“有仇报仇，有冤报冤”的呼声。说书的老太太含着眼泪说：“前年冬天我同两个闺女正在说书场说书，卢万寿把俺们叫到特务队里，没吃饭给他唱了八段书，分文没给，半夜，他硬叫我走，把两个闺女留下过夜，我说：“小孩子不懂事，一个十三一个才十二，请卢五爷多原谅！”他把掩一脚踢倒，揍了一顿，两个闺女吓得乱哭乱叫，后来我拚上老命这样说：“谁家没有姐姐妹妹，你要想霸占俺闺女，就先把我打死！”幸亏别人都来讲了情才得回去。两个闺女也吓病了，整天哭着说胡话！“卢万寿来了！娘！俺怕！”一个邯郸未解放时的妓女（现已转业），含着眼泪说：“我们从前本来就够可怜了！但是卢万寿向来上盘没给过盘钱，住局（即住宿）没给过局钱。又一次，他大白天到我们班里去，集合所有的姑娘们（妓女）都得脱了裤子让他看看。他和特务李丙辰住局，一个和姑娘搞，一个在一边看，并且还要照像。他发了脾气，叫姑娘不穿衣服，整夜在地下跪着。要么到院里雪上跪着。还有一次，他把我们四个姑娘剥了衣服，叫我们钻到桌子下，他脱了衣服蹲在桌子上把尿向我们头上浇，谁动就揍谁………。”她泊索泊索的眼泪，洒在衣襟上。不等大家诉完，群众便不断的举起拳头，怒叫着“铲除这个不是人类的东西！”“要求政府枪毙汉奸卢万寿”“政府要答复群众的要求！”
    王市长立起来给人民作答复，大家用着紧张的心情注视着。
    “………过去是汉奸特务横行霸道的时候，今天是人民向汉奸特务伸冤复仇的时候，世道已经变了，政府接受人民要求，并且已经过法庭审判和高等法院批准，将汉奸卢万寿执行枪决！”王市长斩钉截铁的说了。
    王市长的话刚出口，群众就欢呼起来，一拥把他拉出去，直到看见他倒在血泊里，人们才拍着手长出了一口气。
    人们挤着去看他的尸首，不由得联想到会场门口的一张漫画：当他和汉奸李积玉枪杀十一个八路同志时，最后一个孙同志曾对他庄严的警告：“不要忘了总有一天你会被中国人民处罚的！”
    “真的，你也有了今天！”群众从心底追念着为民族死难的十一个八路同志，同时还咬牙切齿的骂着这个汉奸卢万寿。
