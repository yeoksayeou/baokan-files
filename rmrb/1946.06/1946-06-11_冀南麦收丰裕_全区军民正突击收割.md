    Abundant Wheat Harvest in Southern Hebei
    Military and Civilians Throughout the Region are Rushing to Harvest
    [Special Dispatch from Weixian by Our Newspaper] The masses in various counties of Southern Hebei, now entering the wheat harvest season, are filled with joy over this year's bumper wheat harvest. According to telegrams from various sub-districts: In the first sub-district, including Linqing, Qingping, Guanxian, Guantao, Yuancheng, Cuixian, Qiuxian, Wuxun, and other eight counties, a total of 2,224,700 mu of wheat were planted, accounting for 34.7% of the entire sub-district. Except for some villages in Guanxian and Wuxun, which were previously enemy-created no-man's lands, and this summer also suffered from mole crickets, resulting in reduced yields, the remaining villages, although affected by yellow dwarf disease, still reported bumper harvests compared to previous years. Along both banks of the Wei River, yields ranged from 150 to 200 jin per mu. Grain production in the Linqing area, in particular, increased by one-fold compared to previous years, with the Yuancheng and Longwangmiao areas being the best, yielding 500 jin of wheat per mu. If calculated at a general yield of 150 jin per mu, the entire sub-district could harvest 333,705,000 jin. In the second sub-district, including Xiajin, Qinghe, Enxian, Gucheng, Wucheng, Pingyuan, and other eight counties, a total of 870,700 mu of wheat were planted, and this year's wheat harvest is estimated at 87,070,000 jin, an increase of 34,828,000 jin compared to last year. Villages in the Yongxiang area of the third sub-district also saw an increase of one-third compared to last year. In the Daming area, except for some areas affected by flooding, the leadership of the democratic government in repairing canals ensured that wheat fields along the Yao Dike were not submerged, and yields could still reach 550 jin per mu. Yongnian, traditionally known as a wheat-producing area, suffered from severe wheat dwarf disease, resulting in yields of only 100 jin per mu. In the fourth sub-district, the Nangong and Weixian areas also saw a one-fold increase in yields compared to previous years. Currently, the military and civilians throughout the region are rushing to harvest, with all units and agencies mobilizing to help the masses with the harvest. In the border areas, the masses are carrying out the harvest and storage work with peace of mind under armed protection. In Lu Tai Village and Sheng Fo Tang Village in Weixian, the entire village is using a large-scale labor exchange system to accelerate the harvest. In Xi Qifang Village, Qiuxian, the large-scale labor exchange system resulted in the completion of 80 mu of wheat harvest in two days, increasing production speed by one-fold.
