　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: Athens dispatch: Greek workers held a political general strike on the 19th to protest the fascist legislation known as "Defending Order" being discussed in parliament. The strike was called and organized by the Greek General Confederation of Labor. Despite the fact that the royalist authorities adopted all methods, such as terror, intimidation, and reactionary propaganda via radio and newspapers, in an attempt to thwart the righteous actions of the workers, the vast majority of workers still participated in the strike. The strikes in Savinica and many other places were particularly successful. Of the 37,000 workers in Boehm, 31,000 participated in the strike. Even in Athens, despite the fascist authorities exhausting all methods of sabotage, 37,000 out of 54,000 workers carried out the strike.
