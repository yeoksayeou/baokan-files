    Dongming City After Liberation

    The first thing that struck people in Dongming City after its liberation was the phenomenon of "four many and three fews" on the streets. The "four many" referred to many pillboxes and fortifications, many starving citizens, many empty houses with no residents, and many fleas on the ground. The "three fews" were few pedestrians on the streets, little business activity, and few growing trees. In the short ten days after liberation, its appearance was completely renewed. First, the pillboxes built by the enemy and puppets by demolishing thousands of houses belonging to residents over the past seven or eight years, and the reed fences made from millions of felled trees, which turned the city into an iron fortress, were leveled along with the city walls in just three days, thanks to the efforts of more than 20,000 citizens. The citizens shouted, "We will never let you imprison us again!" Residents happily carried the bricks, tiles, and wood from the demolition to their homes to rebuild their new residences. In the ten days of active relief work by our democratic government, more than a hundred refugee families in the city had already received over 20,000 catties of relief grain. The government also allocated 20,000 catties of grain to provide relief to refugees within the city. Currently, the people in the city are overjoyed. They all thank the People's Liberation Army, the Eighth Route Army, for liberating them and allowing them to return to peaceful days. Old Mrs. Zhang from Nanguan said, "In the past, we had to hand over grain to the government even when we were starving. Now, the democratic government is different; it even gives us grain. I, your old woman, have never seen such a good government in my life." Old Zhen, a stall vendor on East Street, said, "Before the Eighth Route Army came, the streets were as desolate and quiet as if they were hit by frost. There were no ordinary people or businesses. Since the arrival of the Eighth Route Army, the streets have been filled with people from both the city and the countryside. Businesses that had been closed for seven or eight years have reopened. East Street, which used to be the most deserted, has now become the most crowded and prosperous place. On the morning of June 4th alone, there were more than 200 families selling green vegetables on the three streets. Feng Taiyue from Mazhubo Village, 38 miles from the city, sold more than 300 cucumbers in three hours. Mr. Ge sold more than 60 catties of bean sprouts in one hour. Liu Heisan sold more than 200 rice dumplings early in the morning, and Duan Yinhe sold more than 200 catties of pork early in the morning. With the government's assistance, fifty of the more than seventy businesses in the city that had been forced to close due to extortion by the enemy and puppets have started operating again in just over ten days. Currently, various stores are raising capital and rushing to transport goods from Caozhou and other places. The Xietai Chang grain store on East Street sold over 100 shi of grain in three days. The military-civilian cooperative at the crossroads sells over 10,000 yuan worth of goods a day. Dongming City after liberation is under construction, and people of all social strata have begun a happy life, their faces filled with joyous smiles.

    解放后的东明城
    东明城解放后的第一天，首先印入人们的眼帘的：是街道上四多三少的现象。四多即碉堡、工事多，没饭吃的市民多，没人烟的空房多，地上的跳蚤多。三少是街上来往行人少，营业生意少，生长着的树木少。在解放后短短的十天期间，它的面貌焕然一新，首先将七八年来敌伪拆掉居民千百所房屋所建立的碉堡，和被砍掉千万棵树木所做成的如铁城一样的芦柴，在两万多市民的突击努力下，经三天的功夫，把它们和城墙一起平毁。市民们高呼着：“再也不叫你监禁我们了！”居民将拆下的砖瓦木料，愉快的搬到自己的家里，重新建造起自己的新居。在我民主政府十天积极救济工作中，城关的百十余户难民已领到二万余斤救济粮。城内难民，也由政府拨发粮二万斤进行救济。现城关内的人民皆欣喜若狂，他们都感谢解放他们的人民子弟兵八路军，使他们重过太平日子。南关的张老太太说：“过去，咱饿着肚子时，也得给政府交粮食，如今，民主政府可不同了，还给咱粮食，我老婆有生以来没见过这样的好政府”。东大街的摊商老甄说：“八路军没来时，街上和霜打的一样清凉冷静，老百姓，生意，一家也没有，自八路军来了以后，街上拥满了城乡的老百姓，倒闭了七八年的生意，也开了门，以前最萧条的东大街，现在成了人最多，生意最繁荣的地方。仅六月四日的一个早晨，三条街上卖青菜的就有二百余家。距城三十八里马主薄村卖黄瓜的冯太月三小时内就卖掉三百余根，葛老先生一小时卖豆芽六十余斤，刘黑三一清早就卖掉粽子二百多个，段印和一早卖猪肉二百余斤。全城被敌伪勒索而倒闭的七十余家座商经政府的资助，在十多天内，有五十家已开始营业。现各商店正在筹划资本，纷纷的到曹州等地运货，东大街协泰昌粮行三天即卖出粮食百余石，十字街头之军民合作社一天卖货万余元。解放后的东明城一切在建设中，各阶层人民已开始了幸福的生活，他们的脸上都洋溢着欢快的微笑。
