    Xinhua News Agency, Jilin-Liaoning Front, 6th: The county town of Huadian, one hundred li south of Jilin, was recovered by the Democratic Allied Forces on the 3rd. Following the recovery of Heishizhen, forty li northeast of Hailong, on the 31st of last month by our Jilin-Liaoning troops, and the annihilation of a invading army regiment, we continued to expand the victories. On the 2nd of this month, a unit of the Democratic Allied Forces in Jilin-Liaoning began an attack on Huadian, which had been forcibly occupied by the New Sixth Army three days prior, in the evening. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the entire city was recovered at 8:00 AM on the 3rd. A large number of invading troops were annihilated, and the remnants also collapsed. In the western part of Huadian, more than 100 invading troops were captured, along with four vehicles. Other battle results are currently being tallied. Under the influence of this victory, more than 500 men of the New Sixth Army who had occupied Yangzishao (i.e., Jinchuan) fled to Chaoyangzhen (ten li northeast of Hailong) on the 2nd. The Kuomintang army, which launched a southern offensive towards Liuhe on June 1st, has been repelled by the defending troops, with more than 200 casualties inflicted on the invading army. In the battle in which the Democratic Allied Forces recovered Heishizhen, in addition to the complete annihilation of the 181st Regiment of the 207th Division of the New Sixth Army, a U.S.-made Kuomintang bomber was also shot down. At the same time, another unit of the Democratic Allied Forces in Jilin-Liaoning also repelled a battalion of the New Sixth Army attempting to provide eastern support to Heishizhen east of Chaoyang, eliminating a part of it, killing or wounding more than 40 people, and seizing two mortars, two small cannons, and two 60mm mortars, as well as two heavy machine guns.
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 6th: People in various places, in order to safeguard their peaceful and democratic homeland, have risen up to participate in self-defense forces that do not separate from production. The enthusiasm of workers in Harbin to participate in the self-defense forces is extremely high. Zhang Zhanhai and Yang Dianshan, two porters from a certain worksite, after joining themselves, also called on everyone to actively participate. Subsequently, more than a dozen workers signed up to join the Harbin People's Self-Defense Force. The masses in the first district of Bei'an are actively organizing self-defense army backbone teams, with those aged 18 to 30 being organized into backbone self-defense teams, and those aged 31 to 45 being organized into ordinary self-defense teams. The local self-defense force is currently being formed at an accelerated pace.

The fishermen's self-defense team is on the bank of the Nen River, producing and guarding simultaneously. The more than 200 members of the Workers' National Construction Association Independent Brigade are actively engaged in sentry duty, patrols, intelligence delivery, and comforting the wounded.
