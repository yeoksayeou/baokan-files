Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Paris dispatch: The Foreign Ministers' Meeting is accelerating its work on drafting the European treaty. Meetings were held on the 20th in the morning and afternoon. The morning meeting decided that British and American troops should withdraw from Italy within ninety days of the signing of the Italian treaty, and Soviet troops would leave Bulgaria within ninety days of the signing of the treaty with Bulgaria. In the afternoon, the four foreign ministers held their first closed-door meeting, each accompanied by one assistant, to discuss the issue of Italian colonies. It is reported that they discussed the Benes proposal on the issue of Italian colonies previously submitted.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: (Delayed) Paris dispatch: The third session of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting was held on the afternoon of the 18th to discuss the issue of Italian reparations, but no agreement was reached. Byrnes and Bevin continued to advocate that the Soviet Union's demand for $100 million in reparations could be compensated by Italian assets in the territory of former satellite states (i.e., Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Finland) plus Italy and some naval vessels. Molotov believed that this was insufficient and advocated that the shortfall should be made up by Italy's current production over a six-year period. Molotov believed that Italian assets in Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary, and two Italian mail ships currently docked in New York, could be converted to approximately $30 million, and the remaining $70 million should be paid from Italy's current production. Molotov strongly stated that the Soviet demand (number missing) was moderate. He also strongly stated that the occupation fees forced by Britain and the United States on Italy have reached 40 billion yuan. Bidault believed that if the Soviet demand could be met within a two-year period, Italy might be able to do so, but Bevin opposed the proposals of both the Soviet and French sides, and no agreement was reached.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: New York dispatch: The second meeting of the Atomic Energy Control Commission was held on the 19th. Soviet representative Gromyko, on behalf of the Soviet government, proposed to the meeting that all existing stockpiles of atomic bombs be destroyed within three months, and that the manufacture and use of atomic bombs be prohibited by international treaty. Gromyko pointed out that the existence of atomic bombs creates mutual distrust among nations. He stated that exchanging scientific information for the benefit of mankind is indisputable, and that one country or a part of countries cannot single-handedly monopolize scientific inventions. Therefore, Gromyko suggested that the above principles be used as a basis for formulating international treaties and establishing a committee for exchanging scientific information to strengthen scientific cooperation among countries. British representative Cadogan and the Canadian representative, speaking before the Soviet representative, endorsed the American plan. According to the plan announced by American representative Baruch on the 14th, it was suggested to establish an "International Atomic Energy Development Management Agency," which is actually composed of American and British atomic energy experts (possibly without regard to nationality), and has all the power to control and retain the atomic energy research and manufacturing of various countries, as well as the exploration and mining of related raw materials. The plan also stipulates that the veto power of the five powers cannot be adopted in the management agency and its activities. The purpose of this American plan is to create a monopoly position for the United States in atomic bombs and to make it impossible for other countries to conduct atomic energy research and manufacturing. The New York Worker's Daily commented: "Baruch's plan is actually only a new system based on the American veto power to replace the existing cooperative system based on the separate veto power of the great powers."

　　外长会议加速制订和约
    意境英美军在和约签订后三月内撤离
    苏联主张摧毁现存原子弹
    【新华社延安二十一日电】巴黎讯：外长会议正加速其制订欧洲和约的工作，二十日上下午举行集会。上午的会议决定英美军队应在意大利和约签订后九十日内撤离该国，苏军将在与保加利亚签订和约后，九十日内离开保国。下午四外长举行首次秘密会议，每一外长所随带助理一名，讨论意大利殖民地问题。传系讨论贝纳斯前次关于意大利殖民地问题所提的方案。
    【新华社延安十九日电】（迟到）巴黎讯：外长会议第三次会，于十八日下午举行，讨论意大利赔款问题，未能取得协议。贝纳斯与贝文均继续主张苏方一亿美元的赔款要求，可由意大利过去之卫星国（按即罗、保、匈、芬）境内资产加上意大利及若干海军船舶中补救之，莫洛托夫则认为这是不够的，并主张由意大利目前生产品在六年期间补足缺额。莫洛托夫认为罗、保、匈境内意大利资产及两艘现在泊于纽约的意大利邮船，可以折算约三千万元，而短少之七千万元，应由意大利目前生产中偿付之。莫洛托夫力称：苏方要求（中缺数字）温和性。并力称：英美迫使意大利支付的占领费，为数已达四十亿元。比道尔认为如果苏联的要求在两年期间之内起，则意大利是可能这样做的，但贝文反对苏法两方提案，于是未能取得协议。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】纽约讯：原子能管制委员会第二次会议，于十九日举行。苏联代表葛罗米柯以苏联政府名义，向会议建议称：在三月内摧毁一切现有的原子弹储存，并以国际条约来禁止原子弹的制造与使用。葛罗米柯指出：原子弹的存在，造成国际间的互不信赖。并称：为了人类的福利，而互换科学情报，是无可争辩的，一个国家或一部分国家，不能单獗垄断科学发明。因此葛罗米柯建议以上述原则作为基础，制定国际条约，并设立互换科学情报的委员会，以加强各国间的科学合作。英国代表贾德干及加拿大代表在苏代表之前发言时，赞成美国的计划。按美国代表巴鲁区十四日所宣布的计划，建议设立一“国际原子能发展管理处”，该处实际上由美国及英国之原子能专家组成（可能时不分国籍），有一切权力管制及保有各国之原子能研究制造以及有关原料之勘察开采等。该计划并规定不能在管理机构内及其活动中，采用五强否决权。美国此项计划，目的在于造成美国在原子弹方面的垄断地位，并使其他国家不可能进行原子能之研究及制造。纽约工人日报评称：“巴鲁区之计划，实际上仅基于美国否决权之新制度来代替基于各强国单独否决权之现行合作制度”。
