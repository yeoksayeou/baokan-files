Blood Debt Must Be Paid in Blood!
The Guomindang Special Agents Created the Wufujian Massacre
The People of Yuanqu Rise Up in Revenge
The militia immediately surrounded Wufujian, recovered Beipo, Yangpingling and other villages. The special agents fled into the Nishan Forest and are currently being suppressed.
The Taiyue Administrative Office sent a letter of condolence to the families of the martyrs. The Assembly, the Military Headquarters and various mass organizations sent telegrams to the whole country to denounce the crimes of the Guomindang special agents.

[This newspaper's Yangcheng Dispatch] On May 26th and 27th, on the Yuanqu River defense line in the Taiyue area, a total of 57 of our joint defense militiamen, cadres and production team comrades were massacred by the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in Wufujian, causing extreme grief and anger among the people of Yuanqu and other counties. They are now taking up arms to bravely avenge the dead, and have already achieved considerable victories. The details of the massacre and the events before and after it are reported as follows:

After the liberation of Yuanqu, the Yuanqu traitors Liu Hansan and Liu Rurong fled to Henan and hid in the Kuomintang army. Fostered and trained by the Kuomintang, they organized the "Yuanqu Security Detachment", with the two traitors serving as the commander and deputy commander. On May 22nd, under the instructions of the Kuomintang army, they secretly crossed the Yellow River from the Baoshan ferry and sneaked into the Wufujian and Lou@gou areas of our liberated area for secret activities. Under their encouragement and instructions, local special agent scum organized fake farmers' associations to confuse right and wrong and undermine the mass anti-traitor and rent reduction movement. Han Wenjun, Wen Xianzhen, Wu Wenchang and other hidden special agents in Wufujian were even more active in illegal sabotage activities. Comrade Zhang Zhongfu, director of the Armed Forces Committee of our Second District, discovered this matter and arrested the Han Wenjun brothers and their instructor (sent from Henan). On the morning of the 26th, he sent eight militiamen to the county to escort them. The special agents in the village ambushed them in advance at Qingyad底 halfway, and also sent people to mix into the militiamen escorting the prisoners. When they reached Qingyad底, they killed the eight militia comrades, rescued the criminals, and reported to Liu Hansan's unit of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet army. That night, more than a hundred men of this unit raided the Wufujian River defense militia rotation team. Comrade Zhang Zhongfu was killed on the spot, and 34 people were captured (including three production personnel from the sub-district and the independent brigade). That night, 30 militiamen from our Second District went to Wufujian to replace the defense, unaware of this. They were also captured. The next morning, these traitors took the two groups of 64 people to the cliffs on the Yellow River. Every five people were tied together with iron wire. For each bundle, the first person was shot dead, and the corpse carried the four living people and threw them into the Yellow River. Every time they threw a bundle, the traitors shouted, "Let you go to the Yellow River to turn over!" and laughed and rejoiced. They thought that this would scare the other militiamen, but they failed. None of the sixty militiamen wavered. Except for a few people who were thrown down and escaped from the Yellow River, 57 comrades gloriously sacrificed.

After these Kuomintang-supported traitorous special agents threw the 64 militiamen into the Yellow River, they immediately occupied Wufujian, Yangshang, Luanshi Cliff ferry, Diaowo and other ten villages.

When the people of the whole county heard this terrible news, they all hated them with gnashing teeth and demanded revenge. In addition to Director Niu and Pei of the Administrative Office sending letters of condolence to the families of the martyrs, the Taiyue Assembly and various mass organizations immediately sent telegrams to the whole country to denounce the shameless crimes of the Kuomintang special agents. The Taiyue Military Headquarters has issued a painful appeal to the armed forces of the entire region, calling on everyone to rise up to wipe out the special agents and severely attack the invading Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, and calling on the people to join the militia and strengthen armed self-defense. The Taiyue Daily also published a similar call. The Yuanqu militia, under the direct call and leadership of the County Armed Forces Committee, dispatched a large number of people on the day of the massacre, cooperating with ×× troops to surround the special agent team in the Wufujian area. On the 28th, Beipo was recovered, on the 29th, the southern part of Nishan, Yangpingling and Chaishuling were recovered, and Yangshang and Luanshi Cliff were attacked again in the evening. On the 30th, they entered Wufujian, and the special agent traitors fled into the Nishan Forest. On the 31st, we occupied Yangshang and Luanshi Cliff, and are still carrying out the suppression. The cadres and militiamen behind are comforting and resettling the families of the martyrs.

[Another dispatch] After hearing the news of the Wufujian massacre, the people of Yangcheng also ignited anger and demanded revenge for the dead martyrs. They said, "The Yuanqu militia sacrificed to defend the wheat harvest, protect the lives and property of the people on the river bank, and the entire liberated area!" It is reported that Comrade Pu Dechao, the head of the war training section of the county, has personally gone to the Sixth District and other places to lead the militia to fight, and renamed the militia rotation team of the Sixth District "Revenge Team", which was dispatched by the instructor of the district on the 18th of this month. The slogan is "Annihilate the traitorous special agents and the invading Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, and avenge the dead martyrs!"

　　血债终要血来偿！
    国特制造五福涧大惨案
    垣曲人民愤起复仇
    民兵当即包围五福涧，夺回北坡，杨平岭等村，特务窜入尼山森林，现正清剿中。
    太岳行署函唁烈士家属，参议会、武总暨各群众团体通电全国控诉国特罪行。
    【本报阳城讯】五月二十六、七两日，太岳区垣曲河防线上，我联防民兵、干部与生产队同志共五十七人，在五福涧惨遭蒋伪军屠杀，引起垣曲等县人民的极度悲痛与愤怒。现正拿起武器，英勇为死者复仇，并已取得不小胜利。兹将惨案经过与其前后情形报导于下：
    垣曲汉奸刘汉三、刘如荣等，于垣曲解放后，即逃往河南，掩藏在国民党军内。由国民党豢养、训练，组织成“垣曲保安支队”，由该二奸任正副队长，五月二十二日，受国民党军指示，由包山渡口偷渡黄河，潜入我解放区之五福涧，楼＠沟一带秘密活动。当地特务败类在其鼓舞指示下，即组织假农会来混淆黑白，破坏群众反奸与减租运动。五福涧的韩文俊、文显振、吴文昌等暗藏特务，非法破坏活动更为积极，我二区武委会主任张中福同志发觉此事，即将韩文俊弟兄二人及其指导者一人（河南派来的）捕获。二十六日晨，派民兵八人往县里押送。该村特务事先在中途青崖底设伏，又派人混入解送犯人的民兵中。行至青崖底，即将八个民兵同志杀死，将罪犯劫走，并报与蒋伪军刘汉三部。当天夜里，该部百余人奔袭五福涧河防民兵轮战队，张中福同志当场牺牲，三十四人被俘（内有分区及独立大队三个生产人员）。当夜我二区民兵三十人到五福涧换防，不知此事，也被俘获，次日晨，这些奸逆即将两批共六十四人带至黄河边之绝崖上，每五人用铁丝捆成一捆，每捆用枪打死前面一人，让尸首带着四个活人摔下黄河里去。每摔一捆，奸逆们大叫一声：“让你们到黄河里去大翻身！”并大笑大乐。他们以为这样就可以吓丧其他民兵的胆，但他们失败了，六十多个民兵没有一个动摇的。除过几个人被扔下去又从黄河水里逃回来以外，五十七位同志都光荣地牺牲了。
    这些国民党豢养的汉奸特务们将六十四个民兵投入黄河之后，当即占领了五福涧、杨上、乱石崖渡口、吊窝等十来村。
    全县人民听到这个噩耗以后，莫不切齿痛恨，纷纷自动要求复仇。除行署牛裴两主任函唁烈士家属外，太岳参议会及各群众团体当即通电全国控诉国民党特务无耻罪行，太岳武总已向全区人民武装发出沉痛的呼吁，叫大家奋起扑灭特务，痛击进犯之蒋伪军，并号召人民参加民兵，加强武装自卫。太岳日报也发表同样号召。垣曲民兵，则在县武委会的直接号召与领导下，在惨案发生的当日，即大量出动，配合××部队，将五福涧一带特务队包围。二十八日夺回北坡，二十九日夺回尼山南部，杨平岭、柴树岭，晚上又袭击杨上、乱石崖，三十日进入五福涧，特务汉奸们窜入尼山森林。三十一日，我进占杨上、乱石崖，现仍在进剿中。后面的干部民兵，则正在慰问与安置烈士们的家属。
    【又讯】阳城人民听到五福涧惨案消息后，同样燃起了怒火，要求为死难烈士复仇。他们说：“垣曲民兵为保卫麦收、保卫河边人民生命财产与整个解放区牺牲的！”兹悉该县战训科长蒲德超同志已亲赴六区等地领导民兵作战，并将六区民兵轮战队改名“复仇队”，于本月十八日由该区教导员率领出动，口号是“歼灭汉奸特务与进犯的蒋伪军，为死难烈士报仇！”
