　　Border Region Government Sends Urgent Telegram to Nanjing Yellow River Control Authorities
    Urging Suspension of Damming and Implementation of the Agreement
    [Our Newspaper Special Dispatch] The Border Region Government here has urgently telegraphed Comrade Zhou Enlai in Nanjing, forwarding it to the Executive Yuan and the Yellow River Control Authorities, urging the suspension of the damming project, the immediate cessation of digging diversion channels and dismantling railways, and the prompt allocation of complete batches of grain, funds, materials, and resettlement relief funds in accordance with the agreement, to facilitate the project. The original telegram is as follows:
    To Mr. Zhou Enlai in Nanjing, forwarded to the Water Conservancy Commission of the Executive Yuan, Director Xue, Commissioner Huang, Chairman Zhao, and Mr. Todd, representative of UNRRA:
    Since the Nanjing Agreement was established, our Liberated Area government and people have faithfully implemented it, disregarding all difficulties. Our representatives only arrived in Heze on the 25th, and on the 26th, 20,000 people in Dongming, Changyuan, and Juancheng counties began work. After the 15th, work began along the entire line, with the participation of more than 237,000 people. Governments in our counties along the river have suspended all other work and have tried every possible means to help solve the masses' difficulties in harvesting wheat. Cadres at all levels have personally gone to the dikes to organize and lead the masses. This spirit of unity and faithful implementation of the agreement is evident to all in your commission. However, our resources are insufficient, and it is difficult to sustain this effort.
    Conversely, the agreement clearly stipulates that the work grain and funds, materials, and equipment that should be allocated have so far only amounted to four trucks, two broken-down theodolites, and 300 tons of coarse black flour. Such a meager amount is only enough for one day's need for 230,000 people. Funds for cloth and labor, as well as resettlement relief funds for residents in the riverbed, have not been allocated at all, despite repeated requests. This situation will inevitably affect the dike restoration. Furthermore, in terms of project progress, our downstream area not only started work ten days ahead of schedule but has now been working for 25 days, while above Kaocheng and Changyuan outside our area, only one southern dike has been built near Tongwaxiang. The northern dike has not yet been started. Once the water rises, it will inevitably overflow, and we wonder what the intentions are. The agreement clearly stipulates that the Xinbian Railway should not be dismantled for the time being, and diversion channels should not be dug. It also stipulates that the materials and work grain required for urgent projects should be given priority and supplied as quickly as possible, and that the work funds required for urgent projects should be fully raised by the Water Conservancy Commission. It also clearly stipulates that the Yellow River Commission has submitted a plan for the resettlement and relief of residents within the downstream river channel for prompt handling, so as to meet the needs of the damming and dike restoration project and to prevent flooding in the downstream area.
    Now, on the one hand, the clauses in the agreement regarding material assistance have not been implemented, hindering the progress of downstream dike restoration, dredging, and resettlement relief work, while on the other hand, it is planned to dismantle the Xinbian Railway and dig diversion channels after June 16th, preparing to release water. Such a reversal of steps will inevitably lead to disaster.
    The above facts are clear and undeniable. The people are discontented, and speculation is rife. We believe that your commission will prioritize the lives and property of millions of people, will not be misled by a few conspirators, and will vigorously appeal and seek remedy. You must suspend the damming project, immediately stop digging diversion channels and dismantling railways, and promptly allocate complete batches of grain, funds, materials, and resettlement relief funds in accordance with the agreement to facilitate downstream projects. In particular, the dike restoration work on the north and south banks of Kaocheng and Changyuan must begin immediately, and the upstream and downstream must proceed in unison to dispel doubts, quell popular indignation, and benefit cooperation. If this is done, disaster can be turned into fortune, and all people will rejoice. Otherwise, if cooperation is talked about but contradicted by the facts, then once the people rise up to save and defend themselves, unexpected changes will occur, which we believe is also not what your commission wishes to see. We present this matter directly, and the telegram is urgent. We await your clear instructions.
          Government of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region

　　边府急电南京治黄当局
    呼吁暂停堵口执行协定
    【本报特讯】此间边区政府，顷急电南京周恩来同志转行政院暨治黄当局，呼吁暂停堵口工程，立即停止挖引河，拆铁路，并按协定迅速拨发整批粮款器材及迁移救济费，以利工程。原电如次：
    南京周恩来先生转行政院水委会，薛主任、黄委员、赵委员长，暨联总代表塔德先生公鉴：
    自南京协议成立后，我解放区政府与人民，即不顾一切困难，忠实执行。我代表于廿五日方抵荷泽，而二十六日东明、长垣、鄄城等县，即有二万人动工。十五日后，即全线动工，参加群众达二十三万七千余人，我沿河各县，政府，停止一切工作，想尽各种办法，帮助解决群众收麦困难，各级干部们并亲自上堤，组织领导群众。此种上下一心，忠实执行协议精神，乃贵会署人士所共见，奈物力不支，实难持久。
    反之协定明文规定，理应拨给之工粮工款，物资器材，至今只运到汽车四辆，破旧经纬仪两架，黑粗面粉三百吨，似此微末数量，以二十三万人计，仅够一日之需，布料款工款，及河床居民迁移救济等费，虽经再四催谈，迄未拨发分文，似此势必影响复堤。再就工程进行而言，我下游不但提前十日动工，且至今已达二十五日，而我区外之考城长垣以上，只在铜瓦厢附近修筑南堤一道，北面堤岸迄未动工，一旦水发，必至横流，不知是何居心。按协议曾明白规定新汴铁路，暂不拆除，不挖引河，又规定急要工程所需，配合之器材及工粮应优先尽速供给，急要工程所需工款，由水委会充分筹拨，并明白规定，关于下游河道以内居民迁移救济问题，黄委会已呈请有案从速办理，俾能配合堵口复堤工程之需要及不使下游发生水患为原则。
    现在一面既未能执行协议上关于物资援助各条款，阻碍了下游复堤浚河迁移救济等工作的进行，而一面又拟于六月十六日后，拆除新汴铁路，并挖引河，准备放水，似此步骤颠倒必肇巨灾。
    上述种种事实，昭然若揭，人民不平，揣测纷起，想贵会定以千百万人的生命财产为念，不为少数阴谋家所迷惑，鼎力呼号，亟图补救，必须暂停堵口工程，立即停止挖引河，拆铁路，并按协议迅速整批拨给粮款，器材，和迁移救济等费，以利下游工程。尤须对于考城长垣南北岸复堤工作，立即开始，上下游一致进行，以释群疑，以平民愤，而利协作。若此则转祸为福万民欢庆。否则空谈合作而事实相违，则人民一旦奋起，自救自卫，变起不测，想当亦非贵会署之所愿也率尔直陈临电迫切，伫候明教。
          晋冀鲁豫边区政府
