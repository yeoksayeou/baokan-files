    The Border Region Government and Assembly Represent the People of the Entire Region
    Telegraphic Congratulations to Commander Pan on His Uprising
    People of Chahar Province Welcome the Glorious Righteous Act in Haicheng
    [This newspaper, Handan, 7th] Bo Yibo, Chairman of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Assembly, Xing Zhaotang, Vice-Chairman, Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government, and Rong Zihe, Vice-Chairman, sent a telegram to express their condolences to Pan Shuoduan and all the officers and soldiers of the 184th Division who revolted in Haicheng, stating: "General, in order to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, uphold peace and democracy, uphold justice, and disobey unlawful orders, you launched an uprising in Haicheng. The people's wishes are fulfilled, and the General's goodwill is rewarded. We hereby send a telegram on behalf of 30 million people to express our congratulations!"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 5th] All sectors of Chahar Province and Xuanhua City have expressed warm welcomes to the glorious uprising of the Kuomintang's 184th Division in eastern Liaoning. The provincial Federation of Trade Unions, Farmers' Association, Women's Federation, Youth Federation, and Literary Federation, among others, jointly sent a telegram of condolences to the division. After hearing the news, the City Youth Federation, in addition to sending a circular expressing welcome and condolences, also held discussions in various schools on the afternoon of the 4th regarding the current Northeast issue and the righteous act of the 184th Division. Everyone unanimously believed that the Democratic Allied Army's recovery of Yingkou, Haicheng, Dashiqiao, and Anshan once again proved the strength of the Democratic Allied Army, while the uprising of the 184th Division demonstrated that the majority of lower-ranking officers and soldiers within the Kuomintang army were unwilling to engage in civil war. If the Kuomintang reactionaries continue to expand the civil war in the Northeast, they will be playing with fire and burn themselves. Upon hearing this good news, the Xinhua Machinery Factory specifically expressed a warm welcome to the righteous act of the 184th Division at a general meeting of all workers, hoping that they would join the people of the entire country in continuing to oppose civil war and strive for peace and democracy to the end. The Chahar Provincial Government issued a circular to express condolences to all the officers and soldiers of the glorious uprising of the 184th Division. The original telegram stated: "At a time when the Chinese Communist Party is adhering to national peace and voluntarily withdrawing from Changchun in order to quickly stop the civil war in the Northeast, while the Kuomintang reactionaries are openly taking advantage of the situation and frantically expanding the civil war in the Northeast, your army's glorious uprising against the civil war will certainly be supported and praised by the people of the entire country. We express our warm support for your army's uprising and pay our highest respect to all the officers and soldiers of your army! We also hope that your army will make persistent efforts to fight to the end to stop the civil war in the Northeast and strive for national peace. The people of our entire province are determined to fully support your army."

    边府、参议会代表全区人民
    驰电祝贺潘师起义
    察省人民欢迎海城光荣义举
    【本报邯郸七日电】晋冀鲁豫边区参议会议长薄一波、副议长邢肇棠，晋冀鲁豫边区政府主席杨秀峰，副主席戎子和致电慰问海城起义之一八四师潘朔端暨全体将士称：将军为执行政协决议，拥护和平民主，主持正义，不受乱命，举义海城，人民之意愿是伸，将军之善意可酬，谨代表三千万人民驰电祝贺！
    【新华社宣化五日电】察哈尔省及宣化市各界，对国民党第一八四师在辽东光荣起义，均表示热烈欢迎。省工会、农会、妇联会、青联会、文联会等，联名致电该师慰问。市青联闻讯后，除通电表示欢迎慰问外，并于四日下午在各校，就目前东北问题及一八四师义举事件，分别进行座谈。大家一致认为民主联军收复营口、海城、大石桥及鞍山，再一次证明民主联军力量的强大，而一八四师起义壮举，则又说明了国民党军内大部下级官佐和士兵是不愿内战的，如国民党反动派继续扩大东北内战，将会玩火自焚。新华机械工厂闻此佳讯，特在全体工友大会上，对一八四师义举，表示热烈欢迎，希望他们与全国人民一起，为继续反对内战，实现和平民主奋斗到底。察哈尔省政府特发出通电，慰问光荣起义的一八四师全师官兵，原电称：“当此中共坚持全国和平，自动撤出长春，以求迅速停止东北内战，而国民党反动派公然得寸进尺，疯狂扩大东北内战之际，贵军光荣起义，反对内战，一定受到全国人民之拥护与赞扬，我们对贵军起义之壮举，表示热烈拥护，向贵军全体将士致以崇高之敬意！并望贵军再接再厉，为停止东北内战，争取全国和平而奋斗到底。我全省人民，决以全力为贵军后盾。”
