    Tense Atmosphere of Study at Peking University
    All Faculty and Students Put into Practice President Fan's Speech
    [This Newspaper Despatch] Since the opening of Northern University, the atmosphere of study has been extremely high. President Fan's speech has become the guide for all practical actions of the school. At the general meeting of all faculty, staff, and students on April 20th, President Fan delivered an important speech (the full text of which will be published in the inaugural issue of the "Northern Magazine"). He used the international and domestic realities to explain that today's era is an "era of the people," hoping that everyone would recognize and grasp this era. He announced Northern University's mission of "serving the people wholeheartedly," its "seeking truth from facts" school spirit, and its educational policy of "integrating theory with practice." He also emphasized that both teachers and students must cultivate an honest and scientific attitude, and a democratic style of mutual learning. At the time, all faculty, staff, and students were extremely invigorated. They all held unlimited confidence in this new type of teaching. Current facts have already proven that President Fan's speech has become a force among all faculty members and staff, and has become their actual actions. Upon entering the school, one immediately feels a vibrant atmosphere. Teachers and students can raise questions at any time and place to study and discuss with each other. Teachers are constantly striving to ensure the completion of the teaching plan. The entire school is filled with a warm atmosphere of learning, and a new type of university is growing.
