　　Though Dead, Their Glory Remains; Their Names Will Be Passed Down Through the Ages
    Jiaozuo Yangcheng Constructs Cemetery and Memorial Hall

    [Our Newspaper Dispatch]: To commemorate the anti-Japanese war martyrs and the rebirth of the people of northern Henan, the two major constructions in Jiaozuo City - the Anti-Japanese Martyrs Cemetery and the People's Rebirth Memorial Tower, were meticulously designed by Mr. Hua Wenlu, an engineer of the Xinhua Company. After nearly half a year of construction, they were completed in the middle of last month. The cemetery is a three-dimensional building, surrounded by pavilions, artificial hills, fountains, and waterfalls. Stone tablets are erected in front of the tombs, and the tombs are covered with lush green grass, creating an extremely solemn and elegant scene. Every day, there is an endless stream of people visiting the cemetery. The memorial tower is located in the central area of Jiaozuo City. The tower is thirty feet high and bears inscriptions by leaders such as Liu and Deng. It also features an article of about 40,000 words written by Commissioner Du Yu, titled "Record of the Rebirth of the People of the Fourth Special District," which details how the enemy, puppet regime, and Kuomintang plunged the people into the abyss and how the Communist Party's Eighth Route Army came to rescue the people from the depths of misery. Each of the five sides of the tower's spire is inlaid with a red five-pointed star, with electric lights inside the stars. At night, the red starlight is brilliant, making it extremely magnificent.

    [Our Newspaper Dispatch from Yangcheng] To commemorate the martyrs and improve the cultural life of the people, Yangcheng is currently constructing two major buildings: a martyrs' cemetery and a people's education hall. The construction cost of the martyrs' cemetery is between 1.3 million and 2 million yuan. The area is about 30 mu or more, with a large conference hall, three stages, and a martyrs' stele pavilion. It is located in Xichi outside Xiguan, which has clear springs and green willows and has always been a place for tourists to relax. It was damaged during the Japanese occupation of Yangcheng and has now been completely transformed after reconstruction. It is reported that the entire project will be completed by the end of this month.
