Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 10th. The Jinsui Military Region recently issued a public communiqué stating: From April 18th to the end of May, for more than 40 days, Yan's troops, in conjunction with enemy puppets, launched 149 large and small offensives against the Jinsui Border Region (an average of more than three times a day), using a total force of more than 30,000 troops. On the southern front, they have successively occupied Kangcheng Town in Xi County, @Xiang in Fenxi, Yidie Town and Baijia Cliff in Shilou, all within our southwestern Shanxi. Their attacks and "nibbling" against our Central Shanxi Plain Liberated Area are particularly fierce. They have successively occupied Dongcheng and Nanzhuang in Wenshui, Shihou in Jiaokou, Jianxi and Qiaojiazhuang in Fenyang, Beige Town in Taiyuan County, and Yongkang, Nanbeiliujian, Dongxi Liangzhai, Sunjiazhai, Liujiabao, Xibao, Zhao Jiabao, Xigu, Mengfeng, and Nanyin and other villages and towns in the area east of the Fen River. In self-defense battles in the aforementioned areas, our troops and civilians killed, wounded, and captured more than 1,170 Yan's puppet and Japanese officers and soldiers, seized 4 mortars, 4 heavy machine guns, more than 330 rifles, and 13 grenade launchers. In April and May, Yan's troops' actions in the Pingchuan area mainly involved offensives in the Wenshui-Jiaokou area, attempting to forcibly occupy our Kaishan Town, open up the communication line between Wenshui and Taiyuan, and control the entire Wenshui-Jiaokou Plain in order to seize the abundant wheat harvest in the Central Shanxi Plain. The CCP has repeatedly telegraphed the Taiyuan Executive Group regarding Yan's expansion of the civil war, requesting that effective measures be taken quickly to stop it. If Yan's troops do not withdraw from the occupied villages and towns and continue to attack the Liberated Areas, we will resolutely counterattack in self-defense. Yan's side should bear all responsibility for any consequences arising therefrom.

Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 12th. After Yan's puppet and Japanese allied forces occupied the Qing (yuan) Tai (yuan) Xu (gou) Pingchuan area of the Jinsui Liberated Area, they recently transferred troops from various places to reinforce Qingyuan, Jiaocheng, and other places, continuing their invasion. According to investigations, the 202nd and 203rd Regiments of Xu Honglin's 18th Division of Yan's army in Xinzhou, and a part of the 44th Division, along with more than 1,000 troops of Yang's rebel 9th Puppet Column in Taiyuan, more than 400 troops of the Puppet Independent Regiment, and more than 100 Japanese troops have been transferred south to Yangqu, Qi County, Qingyuan, and Jiaocheng. After the 5th, Yan's puppet and Japanese allied forces launched a large-scale offensive on the entire line from Zhongyang to Fenyang and Pingyao to Gaobai (under the jurisdiction of Qingyuan County), a total length of more than 200 li, and were accompanied by tanks and armored vehicles driven by Japanese soldiers. The overall war situation in various places is as follows: (1) On the 3rd, the 211th Regiment of Shen Duan's 71st Division of Yan's army in Yangqu, and a part of the 44th Division of Yan's army in Qi County, in coordination with the 9th Puppet Column and the 4th Puppet Independent Regiment, and more than 100 Japanese troops in Qingyuan and Jiaocheng, totaling more than 4,000 troops, and accompanied by three tanks and two armored vehicles driven by Japanese personnel, launched an offensive against our Wen (shui) Jiao (cheng) Ping (yao) in four routes, successively occupying Xishe Town, Hujiabao, Changfeng, Beishe, Yanjabao (all located about 30 li southeast of Jiaocheng), Wang Mingzhai, south of Gaobai Town and other places. The Eighth Route Army severely attacked the invading troops in the Liudushu area, capturing more than 40 Yan's soldiers and seizing more than 30 rifles. (2) On the 6th, the 208th and 209th Regiments of Liu Xiaozeng's unit of Yan's army in Fenyang, totaling 1,600 troops, forcibly occupied Hejubao, Mijiamang, Wangmin, and other places in the Fenyang County of the Liberated Area. The local Eighth Route Army garrison severely attacked the invading troops in Hejiazhuang, seizing more than 10 rifles. (3) On the same day, the 2nd Regiment of the 44th Division of Yan's army in Qi County, invaded our Yunzhou (between Qi County and Wenshui), and the 1st Regiment of the 11th Division of Yan's army in Wenshui, attacked the area 15 li southeast of the city at the same time.
