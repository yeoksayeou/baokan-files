Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. It is reported: Former French Provisional Premier De Gaulle delivered his first political speech since stepping down on January 20th this year in Bayeux, Normandy, on the 16th, attempting to make a comeback. According to Reuter's and King's reports, De Gaulle's speech "expressed strong support for a bicameral system headed by a president with real power, who can arbitrate between political parties." He opposes the unicameral system advocated by the Communist Party and progressive democrats (political power is generated by and responsible to the unicameral system). King stated: "Observers believe that De Gaulle's speech seems to be crystallizing opinions on the political system into a concrete form, so that in future parliamentary struggles, the strength of the Popular Republican Movement can be strengthened, and the political system can be consistent with the principles proposed by De Gaulle.

    【新华社延安十八日电】据讯：前法国临时总理戴高乐，十六日在那爱的半岛之巴依殴城，发表其自今年一月二十日下台以来之首次政治演说，企图卷土重来。据路透社金氏报导，戴氏之演说：“对于有一个具有实权，能为政党间仲裁者的总统为首的两院制政体，表示强力支持。”而反对共产党及进步民主人士所主张的一院制政体（政治由其产生并向其负责）。金氏称：“观察家认为戴高乐的演说，似乎为使政体的意见结晶为具体形式，如此可以在将来的议会斗争中，加强人民共和运动党的力量，使政体与戴高乐所提的原则相一致。
