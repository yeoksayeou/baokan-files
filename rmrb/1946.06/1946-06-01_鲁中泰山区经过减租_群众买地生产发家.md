Xinhua News Agency, Boshan, 27th. After rent and interest reductions, the people of the Taishan District in central Shandong have shown extremely high enthusiasm for production. Spring fields in the district were generally plowed and sown before the Qingming Festival, and the masses selected fine varieties, resulting in strong seedlings. Under the promotion of labor hero Li Shunzhang, each person planted an average of more than one fen of cotton. For example, in Shangzhuang Village, Laiwu County, 340 people planted 35 mu of cotton. The total amount of cotton planted in the entire tenth district is about 60,000 mu. At the end of the spring plowing season, Zhangqiu, Laiwu and other counties launched tree planting campaigns, with each soldier and civilian in the county planting one to two trees. In Laiwu County, 120,000 trees were planted in nine districts. In Licheng and Tai'an counties, the forest farm directly under the commissioner's office supplied 120,000 saplings. In terms of water conservancy, the commissioner's office provided agricultural loans of 3.5 million yuan to farmers in Laiwu this spring, most of which were used for road construction, river management, and dike repair. The commissioner's office loaned 900,000 yuan to help develop the textile industry. Chenjiazhuang in Laiwu is establishing a textile cooperative. Previously, the entire village had 40 beggar households. Now, not only have the beggars disappeared, but they have also bought more than 40 mu of land. The scale of the cooperative is expanding day by day. In some areas, education in the direction of Wu Manyou has been carried out, and the masses' enthusiasm for production is even higher. For example, in Hebeizhuang, Laiwu, 48 families bought a total of 64 mu. Various counties are now summarizing spring production and arranging summer harvesting and summer plowing work.
