    Taihang Military Region Issues Order
    Troops Should Actively Participate in Mass Movements
    [Special Dispatch] The Taihang Military Region issued a political order on the 31st of last month regarding the active assistance of troops in mass movements. The order pointed out that since March, the troops have achieved significant results in helping the masses to stand up. The border troops of the former Fourth and Sixth Military Sub-districts had assisted the masses in suppressing the black elements; the armed forces of the First and Fifth Military Sub-districts had covered the mass movements; the troops stationed in Xitiehuang of the Second Military Sub-district had struck at the raids of the stubborn troops and comforted the masses, restoring the fighting spirit of the masses. These fully demonstrated the glorious tradition of the "people's army." However, a very small number of troops and certain leaders do not have sufficient understanding of the mass movements, only criticizing without helping, and unintentionally hindering the mass movements, which should arouse serious vigilance. Regarding the future participation of troops in mass movements and the protection of mass movements, the following is decided: A. Cadres will be drawn to lead people's movement organizations in coordination with local efforts to mobilize the masses, organize and support mass armed forces. B. When the situation permits, the troops may collectively participate in mass struggles against traitors, speaking out grievances, reducing rent and clearing debts. In serious situations, it is necessary to strike at the enemy and cover the mass struggles. C. In areas where reactionary forces are particularly active, the troops should help the government capture armed secret agents, suppress black gunmen, and protect the masses, cadres, and activists. D. When the situation permits, soldiers from nearby areas can be organized into groups and led back to participate in mass struggles. E. Political workers should regularly and proactively contact local areas to understand the situation of mass movements and respond to local requests whenever possible; if there are opinions on the mass movement, suggestions can be made to the local areas, but interference should not be made lightly. The order concluded: "Commanders and fighters of our troops who have achieved success in helping and supporting the mass movements should be commended."

    太行军区发布命令
    部队要积极参加群运
    【本报特讯】太行军区于上月三十一日发出关于部队要积极援助群运的政治命令。指出从三月开始，部队帮助群众翻身有着显著成绩。原四、六分区边地部队曾援助群众镇压黑；一、五分区武装掩护群众运动；二分区西铁簧驻军打击顽军的奔袭，并慰问群众，恢复了群众斗争情绪，这些都充分发扬了“人民军队”的光荣传统，但还有极少数部队和某些领导者对群运认识不够，光批评不帮助，无意中阻碍了群运，应引起严重警惕。关于今后部队参加群运和保护群运问题，决定：甲、抽出干部领导民运组织配合地方发动群众，组织与扶植群众武装。乙、情况许可时，部队可集体参加群众反奸、诉苦、减租清债等斗争。在严重情况中，要打击敌人，掩护群众斗争。丙、在反动势力特别活动地区，部队要帮助政府捕捉武装特务，镇压黑枪手，保卫群众、干部与积极分子。丁、情况许可时，可将附近地区战士分组带领回去参加群众斗争。戊、政工人员应经常主动与地方连系，了解群运情况，在可能条件下答复地方请求；如对群众运动有意见，可建议地方，不可轻易干涉。命令最后称：“我部队指战员，帮助与支持群运有成绩者，应予表扬”。
