　　【Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 18th】 Workers in the Border Region are enthusiastically developing production and construction, and constantly creating new tools and substitute parts. Xu Zengduo, a veteran technical worker at the Zhangjiakou Auto Repair Factory, has realized his long-cherished wish to create two types of testers: resistance wire and electric nozzle. This new invention is made purely of single platinum and is highly efficient. The factory has awarded him an invention fee of 10,000 yuan and encouraged him to continue his enthusiastic research. Xu Wenxing, a young worker at the Xiahuayuan Power Plant, used ordinary materials such as charcoal, glass powder, water glue, and iron wire to make his own welding rod. It was recently used to test the modification of gears on a coal machine, proving it to be no less inferior than imported products. Wu Yongjian, the head of the Tool Group at the Ping-Sui Railway Repair Factory, used hemp rope and asbestos to replace the butter hemp packing on the pneumatic hammer. In the future, factories in the Border Region will be able to manufacture this tool in large quantities without having to rely on imports from outside the Border Region. Guan Zhaoping, a worker at the Mingde Printing Bureau, has successfully experimented with converting the gasoline fire on the type-casting machine to electric fire, and the type-casting speed has increased from more than 10,000 characters per day to 25,000 characters.

　　晋察冀工人加强技术研究
    不断创造机件代用品
    厂方多方帮助与奖励
    【新华社张家口十八日电】边区工人热情发展生产建设，不断创造新的工具和机件代用品。张市汽车修理厂老技术工人徐曾多，年来创造抗电丝、电嘴子两种试验器的心愿，已告实现。这种新发明品，纯用单白金制造，效率极为优良。厂方已授予发明费一万元，且鼓励他继续热心研究。下花园发电厂青年工人徐文兴，以木炭、玻璃粉、水胶、铁丝等普通用品，自制电焊约，日前用来试验改装煤机上的齿轮，证明毫不比舶来品逊色。平绥铁路修理厂工具二组长吴永坚，用麻绳、石绵等代替气锤上的牛油麻盘根。今后边区各工厂将可大量自造这种工具，不必再仰给边区外的输入。明德印刷局工人关兆平，试验将铸字机上的汽油火改成电火，亦已成功，铸字速率已由每天一万多字提高到二万五千字。
