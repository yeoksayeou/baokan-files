    "I Don't Want to Fight a Civil War!"
    — A New First Army Soldier Who Fled from the Northeast Speaks
    Xu Xueliang was a soldier in the Kuomintang's New First Army. Because he did not want to fight in the civil war, he ran away from Shuangmiaozhi in the Northeast. He passed through Qiuxian, and the government not only provided food and lodging, but County Magistrate Wei specially prepared refreshments and invited him to a discussion, explaining the situation in the liberated areas and the spirit of the Communist Party and Eighth Route Army soldiers in resisting Japan and currently upholding peace and democracy. This moved him to express his innermost thoughts (Editor).

  "I Was Bound and Brought Here!"
    I am from Wanxian, Sichuan Province, and am twenty-four years old this year. My family has seven members: my father, mother, older brother, sister-in-law, nephew, younger sister, and myself. In the spring of my eighteenth year, the county was conscripting soldiers. The head of the bao wanted to conscript my older brother. My family had no money or connections, and the whole family was worried, so we told my older brother to temporarily hide at his wife's parents' house for a couple of days. Unexpectedly, the next morning, the head of the bao, leading the police, surrounded my village and, like binding a criminal, tightly bound me with ropes and sent me to the county, from which I was transferred to the division headquarters. For five or six months, I had no freedom at all; someone watched me even when I went to defecate or urinate.

  Using Guns to Suppress Deserters
    After being confined for half a year, I was issued a gun. I went to Yunnan and then to Burma to help the British fight the Japanese. In those two years, I only fought a few battles. After Japan surrendered, we went from Guilin to Guangzhou. Because officers and soldiers were treated unequally, the soldiers were unwilling to endure it, and many deserted. From our company alone, a whole platoon ran away at once, even taking five pistols with them. Whenever we moved, a few days before, the officers would lecture us, saying, "We must clean the houses well; we will be staying here often!" Until the time of departure, they would still tell us that we were practicing packing our bags! Another method was to use guns to suppress the soldiers. In Yunnan, I personally watched five brothers who had deserted being caught and immediately shot.

        Taking American Ships to the Northeast
    Before we went to the Northeast, we heard nothing about it until we boarded the ship in Hong Kong, when they said we were going to the Northeast. That was in February. After arriving in Kowloon, the Americans issued new clothing and daily necessities. We took a ship from Kowloon to the Northeast and landed at Qinhuangdao. The division commander lectured us, saying, "There is no war; we are here in the Northeast to take over defenses." But at the same time, each machine gun was issued 10,000 rounds of ammunition (I am a machine gunner). After resting in Qinhuangdao for three days, the deputy regimental commander also told us, "Although there is peace, there are bandits here. We still have to fight the bandits. Our weapons are good, and with American help, we are not afraid of bandits." But this raised a question in my mind that I couldn't resolve—how big are these "bandits" here? Why would American warships transport so many troops?

  I Don't Want to Fight a Civil War
    From Qinhuangdao, via Jinzhou to Shenyang, and then passing through Kaiyuan to Shuangmiaozhi, all along the way, officers lectured us to pay attention to vigilance and be prepared for battle at any time, repeatedly explaining that we were not afraid of "bandits." This made me even more suspicious. The second day I stayed in Shuangmiaozhi (April 8th) at dusk, I went to a peasant's home. That fellow villager was from Hebei Province and had settled there. He saw that I spoke politely and showed me affection, especially boiling water for me. I sat down and asked him about the situation in the Northeast. At first, he didn't dare to say anything, but after I repeatedly explained that we were both from Guanli (inside the Pass), he told me in a low and heavy voice, "There are no bandits here. There are many Eighth Route Armies and Democratic Allied Armies…" Suddenly, he asked me in a very strange manner, "The Eighth Route Army and the Democratic Allied Army, they all fought the Japanese very resolutely. They drove the Japanese away. Why are you Central Army coming to fight them? You just defeated the Japanese, and now Chinese are fighting Chinese, alas…" My face flushed, and for a long time, I couldn't think of a word to answer him. A few days later (by the 14th), seeing that we were about to move to the front line, I made up my mind. Using the excuse of going to buy vegetables, I went straight to the home of that old fellow villager from Hebei, changed into civilian clothes, and ran away. That old fellow villager sent me out of the village, repeatedly urging me, "You are a good person for not fighting in the civil war."

  Officers' Guns are Specifically for Shooting Their Own Soldiers
    The Central Army has always treated officers and soldiers unequally. No one trusts anyone. It's not like you (referring to the Eighth Route Army), who discuss things together like one family. In the Central Army, when fighting, the officers are in the rear supervising the battle. Whoever doesn't go forward will be shot. Platoon leaders and squad leaders all use submachine guns, specifically to shoot their own brothers. No soldier wants to fight in the civil war. Now that he (referring to the Kuomintang reactionaries) wants to fight a civil war, even if he catches deserters and shoots them, the number of deserters in the New First Army is increasing.

  You Have Moved Me
    Since I escaped, I entered Shanhaiguan. In less than half a day, I met the Eighth Route Army. For more than a month, I passed through more than twenty counties, traveled more than a thousand li, and didn't suffer any injustice. They all issued official documents from one county to another, entertaining me and giving me travel expenses, and everywhere I met comrades who patiently explained the situation in the liberated areas. At the same time, I also encountered many officers and soldiers demobilizing on the road. The facts have shattered the deceptions of the Central Army officers and shattered many of my doubts. I feel only shame and gratitude in my heart.

### “我不愿打内战！”——从东北逃回的新一军战士谈

    “我不愿打内战！”
    ——从东北逃回的新一军战士谈
    徐学良是国民党新一军的战士，因不愿打内战从东北双庙子跑回来，路过邱县，政府除予以饮食住宿招待外，魏县长特备茶点邀他座谈，给他讲了解放区的情形，及共产党八路军抗战的战士与目前坚持和平民主的精神，使他感激的说出了心底话（编者）
  “我是捆来的！”
    我是四川万县人，今年二十四岁，家有父、母、哥、嫂、侄子、妹妹和我七口人。我十八岁那年春天，县里征兵，保长要征我哥哥，我家没有钱也没有门子，全家都发愁，叫我哥哥到嫂嫂娘家暂躲两天，不料第二天早晨，保长领着警察就把我的庄子围住了，象捆犯人一样，把我用绳子紧紧的捆起来送到县里，由县转送到师管区。一直五六个月没半点自由，拉屎、撒尿都有人监视。
  用枪杀镇压逃亡
    被禁半年后，发给了枪。到云南又到缅甸帮着英国打日本，在那里二年多只打了几次仗，日本投降后，我们又从桂林到广州。因为官兵不平等，士兵不甘忍受，开小差的很多，只我们那一连一下就跑了一个排，还带了五支手枪。每逢移防，前几天官长就训话说：“要把房子打扫干净，我们要经常在这里住了”，直到出发时还跟我们说是练习打背包呢！另一个办法就是用枪杀镇压士兵。在云南时，我亲眼看着捉了回去五个开小差的弟兄，一下都枪毙了。
        坐美轮到东北
    往东北开以前，没听到半点消息，直到在香港上了轮船，才说要到东北去，那时是二月间，抵九龙后，美国发给了新的服装及日常用品，从九龙坐轮船到东北，到秦皇岛登陆后，师长训话说：“没战事了，咱们是来东北接防的。”但同时每挺机枪却发给了一万发子弹（我是机枪射手）。在秦皇岛休息了三天，团副也给讲话说：“虽然和平了，但是这里有土匪，我们还得打土匪，我们的武器好，有美国帮助，是不怕土匪的”。但使我发生了不能自解的疑问，——这里有多么大的“土匪”？何劳美国军舰运这么多的军队？
  我不愿打内战
    从秦皇岛经锦州到沈阳，又路过开源到双庙子，一路上到处长官训话要我们注意警戒，随时准备战斗，再三说明我们是不怕“土匪”。这愈加使我怀疑。住双庙子第二天黄昏（四月八号），我到一个老百姓家，那个老乡是河北人，在那里按家。他看我说话和气，对我表示亲近，特地给我烧了开水，我就坐下问他东北各种情形，起初他还不敢说，后经我再三说明咱们都是关里人，他才用低而沉重的嗓音一一告诉我：“这里没有土匪，这里有很多八路军、民主联军………”猛然他又以很奇怪的样子问我：“八路军民主联军，他们都打日本很坚决，人家把日本打跑了，怎样你们中央军反来打他们，刚把日本打败了，中国人又来打中国人，唉……”我红着脸，半天也没想出一句话可以回答他。过了几天（到十四号）看劲头快要往火线上开了，我就下了决心，借口去买菜，一直到那个河北老乡家换了便衣，就跑出来了。那老乡送我出了村，几次嘱我“你不打内战，是个好人”。
  官长的枪专打自己的兵
    中央军向来是官兵不平等，谁和谁都不一个心眼，那象你们（指我八路军）遇事商量象一家人一样。中央军打仗，当官的在后边督战，谁不上前，就枪毙谁。班长排长都使着冲锋枪，专用来打自己弟兄。士兵没一个愿打内战的。现在他（指国民党反动派）要打内战，尽管捉回逃兵枪毙，但新一军开小差的是越来越多了。
  你们感动了我
    我自逃出以后，进了山海关，不到半天就碰见八路军。一个多月经过二十多县，走了一千多地，没受一点屈，都是从这一县开公事到那一县，招待我给我路费，并到处遇见同志给我耐心的讲解放区的情形。同时我也在路上碰到许多官兵复员，事实打破了中央军官长对我的欺骗，也打破了我的许多疑惑，我心里感到只有惭愧和感激。
