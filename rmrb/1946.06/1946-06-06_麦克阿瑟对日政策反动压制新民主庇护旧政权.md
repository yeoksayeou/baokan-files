Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd. An article in the newspaper *Izvestia* criticizes MacArthur's policy towards Japan as a "flagrant violation" of the Far Eastern Commission's resolutions regarding Moscow. The article states, "MacArthur has not complied with the Far Eastern Commission's proposal to postpone the election and has officially recognized Japanese reactionaries as 'democrats,' which is an encouragement to their cunning tactics and inconsistent with the decision to democratize Japan." The author points out, "Both Japanese and American democratic newspapers say that the Yoshida government is no different from the Shidehara cabinet." The author then criticizes Acheson, MacArthur's representative, for his remarks on the letter from the "May 1st" democratic groups to the Committee on Japan, as "an attempt to undermine the fair demands of democratic groups." MacArthur's prohibition of demonstrations by democrats "considerably deprives them of participating in the determination of Japan's fate." His approval of the reactionary new draft constitution violates the Moscow Conference's decision on the Far Eastern Commission, giving people the impression that MacArthur's views on the issue of Japan's democratization differ significantly from the attitudes of the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council. The American occupation authorities are defending the old regime in Japan and are making every effort to prevent the implementation of the Potsdam Declaration.

    麦克阿瑟对日政策反动压制新民主庇护旧政权
    【新华社延安三日电】消息报撰文批评麦克阿瑟对日本的政策，为对莫斯科关于远东委员会决议的“劣迹昭著的破坏”，该文称：“麦克阿瑟并未遵从远东委员会之延期选举提议，而且正式承认日本反动分子为‘民主分子’，这是对他们的狡猾计策的鼓励，与日本民主化之决定不相符合”。作者指出：“日美民主报纸均谓吉田政府与币原内阁毫无异样”。作者即斥责麦克阿瑟之代表阿契生，对“五一”民主团体致对日委员会的函件的发言是，“企图危害民主团体公正要求”。麦氏禁止民主人士举行示威，“相当地剥夺了他们参加对日本之命运的决定”。他的批准反动的新宪草，违反了莫斯科会议对远东委员会的决定，使人们得到这样的印象：对日本民主化问题，麦氏的意见与远东委员会及盟国委员会的态度之分歧，已很明显。美占领当局正在保卫日本旧政权。竭力阻止波茨顿宣言之实现。
