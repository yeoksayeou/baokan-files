　　Warning! Warning!
    Kuomintang Secret Agents Attempt to Bide Their Time and Cause Trouble
    Multiple Bandit and KMT Secret Agent Cases Cracked in Changyuan and Puyang Counties.
    [Report from our Heze office] It has been learned from Kuomintang secret agent cases recently cracked in Changyuan and Puyang Counties, Ji-Lu-Yu, that Kuomintang secret service agencies are actively organizing forces, preparing to launch large-scale armed sabotage activities after the green crops grow tall. According to Chang Kai, a KMT secret agent captured in Changyuan County (who infiltrated our Changyuan Civil Transportation Team as a cook and was arrested for spreading rumors in Caiyuan under the guise of a worker), he was sent by the "Rich Peasant Corps," a Kuomintang secret service organization in Taibao, Changyuan. His mission was to contact those east and west of the river, establish connections in the first district of Anyang, and organize gangsters. He used the guise of a superstitious organization called "Zong Su Tang" and had already made contact with Beigou Village and Junzhai and other villages along the Wei River. The assigned task was: to mainly carry out secret activities and expand influence before the wheat harvest. Once the green crops grow tall, they would launch large-scale armed sabotage activities, scattering during the day and gathering at night to carry out assassinations and surprise attacks. In Puyang County, the 5th District Joint Defense Team cracked 13 cases of bandit secret agents, all of which were led by the Kuomintang. They also had the same preparations as the Changyuan secret agents.
