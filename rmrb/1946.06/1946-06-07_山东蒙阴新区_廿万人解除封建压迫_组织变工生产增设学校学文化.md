    Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 31st. The 200,000 people in the newly liberated area of Mengyin County were fully involved in the movement of anti-traitor struggle, speaking out about grievances, and rent and interest reduction from March to May this year. Eighty percent of the peasants redeemed a large amount of land occupied by traitors, bullies, and feudal landlords. Forty percent of the peasants participated in mass organizations. People's lives have been improved. The current movement is developing in depth towards organizing labor exchange teams and increasing production through land reclamation. Mengyin County has nine districts and is an area where feudal exploitation was extremely cruel. The general rent division was three/seven, or even two/eight (landlord eight/tenant two). In addition, exploitations such as "portion grain," "portion shoes," and "portion silkworms" (i.e., making shoes and raising silkworms for landlords without compensation) were very common. There was a type of "old deficit grain," where tenants borrowed one dou of grain from the landlord and returned three dou the following year. The borrowed one dou still retained the loan relationship, and another three dou were paid the following year. Other extra exploitations such as "gift-giving" were countless. During the enemy occupation, some landlords turned to the enemy, harmed their compatriots, and shifted the burden of resisting the enemy, causing 80% of the people in the county to be in extreme suffering. In the two months of the emancipation movement, the masses have recovered this blood debt from traitors, bullies, and feudal landlords. According to incomplete statistics for the county: the masses have received compensation for more than 32,000 mu of land and more than 476,000 jin of grain. The enthusiasm of the peasants for production has greatly increased. Labor exchange teams have been organized in most villages, and more than 2,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed. The cultural demands of the peasants are also increasing. In the southern district alone, 27 primary schools, 30 "early and noon classes" (classes in the early morning and noon), 66 literacy classes, and 5 reading groups have been established.

    廿万人解除封建压迫
    组织变工生产增设学校学文化
    【新华社临沂三十一日电】蒙阴县新解放区二十万人民，今年三月至五月完全卷入了反奸诉苦减租减息的运动中。百分之八十的农民，从汉奸恶霸封建地主手中赎回了大批被霸占土地，百分之四十的农民参加了群众组织，人民生活已得到改善，现运动正向着组织变工队，开荒增产深入发展中。按蒙阴县共有九个区，是封建剥削十分残酷的地区，一般分租为三、七，甚至二、八的（地主八佃户二）此外，“份子粮”、“份子鞋”、“份子蚕”（即给地主无代价的做鞋养蚕）等剥削，均甚普遍，有一种“老缺粮”，系佃户借地主一斗粮，来年还三斗，其借之一斗仍保留借贷关系，转年又交三斗。其他如“送礼”等额外剥削，更是不一而足。敌占期间，更有部分地主投敌附逆，残害同胞转嫁对敌负担，致使全县百分之八十群众处在极端痛苦中。两个月来的翻身运动，群众已向汉奸恶霸封建地主索还了这笔血债，据全县不完全统计：群众得到赔偿土地在三万二千亩以上，粮食四十七万六千余斤。农民生产情绪激增，大部村庄变工队已组织起来，并开荒二千余亩，农民文化要求亦在增高，仅南区就成立小学二十七处，“早午班”（清早和中午上课）三十处，各种识字班六十六处，读报组五个。
