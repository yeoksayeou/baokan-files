[This report from Yangcheng] The wheat harvest in the Taiyue Liberated Area has been fully completed. The areas along the Tongpu Railway and on the north bank of the Yellow River have finished reaping and threshing. The wheat in several counties, including Quwo, Wenxi, Jiyuan, and Mengxian, has been dried and stored. This year's wheat harvest, whether in new or old liberated areas, implemented large-scale summer harvest mutual aid, widely absorbing semi-laborers to participate. In 町店村, the women's mutual aid group of fourteen people, led by female volunteer teacher Wang Migui, harvested 47 mu of wheat in three days, averaging 1.1 mu per person per day. The children's mutual aid group of twenty-eight people, led by children's captains Wang Zhanglin and Zhang Xingwang, harvested 75 mu of wheat in three days, equivalent to the efficiency of the fully-able-bodied in the mutual aid groups, so the reaping proceeded exceptionally quickly. In Licun, Quwo's Fourth District, with the mutual aid of the entire village's labor force, all 3,645 mu of wheat in the village were harvested in six days. In Wenxi, the slogan "Women reap, men pull, women dry, men store" was also put forward. Dongda Village harvested 2,000 mu of wheat in three days. Especially in the border areas, the tense struggle to defend the wheat harvest was intertwined with military and labor efforts. A combat team composed of six hundred militiamen in Quwo guarded the hills on the east bank of the Fen River, ensuring that the county's more than 300,000 mu of wheat would not be raided by the Yan army, and the harvest was completed in four days. Thousands of militiamen and river defense teams along the Yellow River formed a Great Wall, repelling more than a dozen attacks by the Chiang-Yan armies to seize wheat. Militiamen in the hinterland also made expeditions to the border areas to cover and assist the harvest. The large-scale assistance team of two thousand people, dispatched from the hinterland of Wangwu to seven villages including Zhaota, rushed to harvest 20,000 mu in three days. The Chiang-Yan armies' conspiracy to seize wheat suffered a serious setback. According to materials from various sources, the average wheat yield in the entire area was eight dou per mu in both mountainous and plain areas; however, due to excessive rainfall this spring, the wheat suffered from yellow jaundice and black jaundice, reducing the yield by about 30%. According to Yicheng materials, the county has 350,000 mu of wheat fields. The wheat yield in irrigated land is 2.5 shi per mu, and in dry land, it is 8 dou. The total yield for the county is estimated at 280,000 shi of wheat, an increase of more than 93,000 shi compared to last year. The county's 110,000 people each harvested about 2.5 shi of wheat, greatly improving the people's lives, and they are all excited and happy, grateful for the leadership of the democratic government.
    [This report from Changzhi] The militiamen around Taihang are actively fighting against stubborn puppets who are seizing wheat. On the Tongpu front: The Yuci-Taigu militiamen have repelled more than twenty incursions by the Yan army in the past half month, killing and wounding more than ten Yan soldiers, and capturing one machine gun. The wheat harvest defense team organized by the Qixian militiamen had repelled the Yan army's attack seven times by the 25th of last month, and on the 7th, they also defeated more than thirty Yan soldiers who attacked from Baicheng Town, and captured two enemy scouts. On the Yubei front: The Huijia militiamen repelled a large group of stubborn puppet wheat snatching teams on the 9th, killing five stubborn puppet platoon leaders and below. The Tangyin militiamen joint defense team, before the 12th of this month, repelled thirteen incursions by stubborn puppets attempting to seize wheat, killing and wounding three puppet soldiers. Landmines killed and wounded five puppet soldiers, and captured seven enemy scouts. The Dongjiusi Village militiamen, in coordination with the troops, defeated a large-scale attack by the stubborn army on the 2nd, and on the 3rd and 7th, with the assistance of the Linxian militiamen, repelled two retaliatory attacks by more than eighty stubborn puppets. On the 13th, the stubborn army stationed in Changyancun, Huixian County, surrounded Shigijie, and the puppet Huixian Security Regiment surrounded Zhangfeicun and its vicinity, attempting to eliminate the Linxian militiamen detachment covering the wheat harvest in that area. The detachment safely broke through, and the stubborn puppets were quickly repelled by the militiamen commanded by the Huibei County magistrate.
