    【Special Dispatch from this Newspaper】The puppet army of Liao City, led by Pang Changshen, and the puppet Donglin Road troops of Chen Shengtang, under the instructions of Kuomintang's He Siyuan, successively raided our area for wheat on the 21st and 22nd of last month. After the masses of Liao City were robbed on the 21st, they immediately reported to our army on the 22nd. Our army immediately responded to the people's request and intercepted the puppet troops who were robbing wheat. After a fierce battle for about an hour, the puppet army suffered casualties and fled back into the city. Another unit of Chen Shengtang's puppet Donglin Road troops stationed in Yingguantun, Gaotang, robbed wheat in Hou Yaozipo, Dianzi, Huajia'ao, Dizi, Zhangzhuang, and Jiezhuang on the 21st of last month in two routes. Our army rose up to defend themselves, and after a fierce battle for an hour and a half, all the puppet troops were repelled. At 11 o'clock, the puppet Chen Shengtang gathered more than 400 troops, led by Cao Qi, and launched a fierce attack on our Sunjia Temple garrison. After a fierce battle until about 2 p.m., the puppets suffered more than 80 casualties and fled back to their original positions. We also suffered 13 casualties. In the Anyang area, more than 210 puppet soldiers of Wang Ziquan's unit raided grain in the Yicheng Village area on the 14th. They were resolutely resisted by our local troops. The puppet army suffered dozens of casualties and routed, and we captured 3 prisoners and seized 2 machine guns and 10 rifles and carbines.
    【Special Dispatch from this Newspaper】The Yan puppet troops, who have continuously invaded our liberated areas east of the Tongpu Railway, have also suffered the punishment they deserve. On the 24th and 25th, the 637th Regiment of the 44th Division stationed in Huoxian twice occupied our Jinbi but were repelled by us. The 218th Regiment of the 73rd Division stationed in Lingshi besieged Yin Yuan on the 23rd. Our army bravely broke through. Another unit occupied our Jingping Town. Part of the Yan bandits' 44th Division in Jiexiu, after attacking our Hongshan again at dawn on the 26th, successively attacked our Dongxihu Long, Wutun, Liujiashan, Majiashan and other places, looting and conscripting. The 219th Regiment of Pingyao, after attacking Pucun on the 25th and being repelled, regrouped more than 1,000 elites from Qixian and Pingyao and attacked and besieged our Yuebi again on the 27th, but was also repelled by our army. The Yan bandits suffered more than 40 casualties. According to a dispatch from Yangcheng: More than 600 men from the 72nd Division stationed in Liancheng went to Xicun on the border between Anyi and Quwo on the 20th to rob wheat. The Quwo militia were forced to defend themselves and repelled them all after an hour of fierce fighting.
    On May 30, the Yan army moved out from Xugou in three routes, with a total of more than 1,400 people, and fiercely attacked the Dongxi Xianyang Villages south of Taigu, attempting to establish strongholds for robbing wheat. Our army was forced to defend itself, and the Yan army suffered more than 70 casualties and fled back. On May 24, the 219th Regiment of its 70th Division and a regiment of the 34th Division attacked our Taigu Northwest Dapu garrison. After three days of fierce fighting, the Yan army suffered more than 150 casualties and gained nothing. Our army is bravely and calmly preparing to strike at the Yan puppet's wheat-robbing incursions at any time.
