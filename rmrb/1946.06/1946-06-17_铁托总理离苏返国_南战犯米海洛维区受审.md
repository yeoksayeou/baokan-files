Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 13th: Moscow dispatch: Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito and other members of the delegation have left Moscow. Molotov and Soviet political and military representatives went to the airport to see them off. Before departing, Marshal Tito made the following statement over the airport loudspeaker: We are deeply moved and delighted that the Soviet government, especially the great Stalin, fully understands the difficulties our country is encountering in its reconstruction work! The conclusion of the Soviet-Yugoslav agreement is of great importance to the restoration of the suffering Yugoslav nation and proves that the Soviet Union is the most loyal friend and protector of the Yugoslav people.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 14th: Belgrade dispatch: The special court here has begun the trial of Yugoslav war criminal Mihailović. He admitted that he had connections with the Germans and the Yugoslav puppet government in 1941. He also stated that he attempted to entice Quisling elements to join his army. He also told the court that British Colonel Bailey had told him to "eliminate the guerrillas" at the end of 1942. Mihailović then sophistically argued: "I don't think this is a crime."
