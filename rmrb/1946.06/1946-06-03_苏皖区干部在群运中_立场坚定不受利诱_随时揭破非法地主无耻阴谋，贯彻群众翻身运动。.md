Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 27th. Democratic government cadres in the Suwan Border Region's mass movement are exposing the enticements of local bullies and landlords, and are thoroughly implementing the people's rent reduction and settling accounts for illegal exploitation. Peng Sirui, the head of Zhangji Township in Yishan District, Suining County, was leading the masses in rent reduction when the illegal landlord Hu Anxin, through his lackey Hu Kangshan, used money, wine, and meat to entice him, saying, "If you ever need money in the future, come here and take it." Peng Sirui immediately replied, "The government provides food and clothing; I don't need your money!" Hu Kangshan, at a loss, pointed to Peng Sirui's torn trousers and said, "I'll have a new pair made for you tomorrow." Peng Sirui immediately retorted, "There's really no need for you to worry about that!" A few days later, Hu Kangshan actually sent Peng Sirui a new pair of serge trousers, which Peng immediately refused, telling Hu, "Don't bother with these tricks; doing this only makes your landlord more disgraceful." When the masses found out, they immediately gathered for a meeting, reasoned with Hu Anxin, exposed his conspiracy, and Hu immediately spat out the over-collected rent grain. Xu Zhenhui, the head of Kongmiao Township outside the East Gate of Qingjiang, has consistently been active in his work, so some illegal landlords tried to buy him off with money. One morning, before Xu had gotten out of bed, a certain landlord specially called Jie Shoukang to his bedside, took out one hundred yuan of new anti-Japanese currency, and stuffed it into the quilt. Xu Zhenhui immediately put on his clothes, returned the money to Jie Shoukang, and said to him, "Go, go! Take the money back; I may be poor, but my bones are hard; I can't harm everyone for your little bit of money." Jie Shoukang had no choice but to retreat. After the poor people found out, they immediately demanded that the township head convene a meeting to settle old scores with the landlord. Sha Baoqian, a stubborn landlord in Jiqing Township, Yangmiao District, Huaibao County, knowing that he had exploited his tenants too heavily in the past, used his lackeys Zhao Tingyu and Che Jinpei. He ordered Zhao to secretly threaten the tenants, and Che to pretend to be active and mix into the accounting committee. He also had his wives act pitiful and plead with the tenants. Some tenants softened, but after the township head convened a tenants' meeting and exposed the conspiracy, the tenants' fighting spirit was rekindled. At the end of the accounting, Che Jinpei came up with another trick, saying, "Leave the grain here; I still have accounts to settle with him!" The township head exposed him on the spot, and Che had nothing to say. Under everyone's demand, he confessed on the spot that he had been used by the landlord.

    苏皖区干部在群运中
    立场坚定不受利诱
    随时揭破非法地主无耻阴谋，贯彻群众翻身运动。
    【新华社淮阴二十七日电】在苏皖边区群运中民主政府干部，揭破恶霸地主利诱，贯彻人民的彻底减租及清算非法剥削。睢宁宜山区张集乡乡长彭思瑞，领导群众减租时，不法地主胡安信，利用狗腿胡康山用金钱和酒肉利诱彭乡长，并对彭乡长说：“你今后如没钱花，来此地拿。”彭思瑞立即回答他说：“公家发吃发穿，不要你的钱！”胡康山没法，指着彭乡长破裤子又说：“我明天替你做一条新的。”彭思瑞立刻回驳：“实在用不着你操心！”隔几天，胡康山真的给彭乡长送来一条新的呢夹裤，当经彭乡长严词拒绝，告诉胡说：“不要费这些心思，你这样做，越给你家地主丢丑。”群众知道后，立即集合开会，向胡安信说理，揭破其阴谋，胡当即吐出了多收的租粮。清江东门外孔庙镇乡长徐贞惠，工作一贯积极，一般不法地主，便以金钱收买他。一天早晨趁徐未起床前，某地主特叫解寿康到他床前，掏出一百元新抗币朝被窝内一揣，徐贞惠马上披起衣服，把钱还给解寿康，对他说：“去，去！把钱拿去，我人穷骨头是硬的，不能为你这点钱害了大家。”解寿康只得退出，穷人们知道后，立即要求乡长召开大会，向该地主清算旧账。淮宝县杨庙区吉庆乡顽固地主沙保前，自知往日对佃户剥削太重，利用狗腿赵廷玉、车金培二人，叫赵暗地威胁佃户，叫车假装积极混进算账委员会，又叫自己大小老婆装做可怜样子向佃户恳请，一部佃户软下来了，后经乡长召开佃户会，揭穿阴谋，佃户们斗争情绪重又掀起。车金培在算账结束时，又出花样，他说：“你们把粮留下，我还有账同他算！”经乡长当面拆穿，车无言可说，在大家要求下，当面坦白受地主利用。
