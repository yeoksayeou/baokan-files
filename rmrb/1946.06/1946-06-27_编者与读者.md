Editors and Readers
    The paper should be delivered faster
    Editor:
    I am an avid reader of your newspaper in Xingtai City, and I teach in a primary school. My colleagues and I look forward to receiving the newspaper early and regularly every day. However, this city is only about a hundred miles away from Handan, but we often only see the newspaper after four or five days, and sometimes two or three issues are delivered together. Everyone is often distressed by this. As the saying goes, "Love it deeply, expect it earnestly," so I venture to speak frankly, hoping that there can be some improvement. Otherwise, many things will become old news, which will greatly affect the role of the newspaper. I hastily write this, hoping for your clear understanding. I wish you well!
    Sincerely,
    Xie Zhenzhong

    Mr. Xie:
    Reading your letter, I feel deeply ashamed. There have long been complaints about the slow distribution of our newspaper. However, the distribution of our newspaper is handled by the post office, and the bureau is limited by manpower and material resources, so it is difficult to fully satisfy everyone's wishes for the time being. Our newspaper has also made repeated suggestions, and we have heard that the bureau is currently making improvements in many ways, and it may soon be faster than it is now. I hereby reply to you and hope that you will speak frankly so that we can improve. I wish you a pleasant summer!
              The Editor

　　编者与读者
    报纸寄递要快编辑先生：
    我是邢台市一个贵报的热心读者，我在一个小学里教书。我和我的同仁们每天都盼望报纸早些来，经常来。但是，本市与邯郸相距不过百余里，报纸常常是四、五天才能看到，有时甚至两三期一起送来。大家经常为此而苦恼。语云：“爱之殷、期之切”，故特冒言直陈，望能有以改进。否则许多东西已成明日黄花，影响报纸作用至巨。匆匆草此，诸希亮察。此请撰安！
    谢贞忠谨上谢先生：
    拜读君书，良深感愧。敝报发行迟缓，啧啧早有传言。惟敝报发行统由邮局办理，该局限于人力物力，一时尚难尽如人意。敝报亦曾屡次建议，闻局方现正多方改进中，不久或可较现在确实迅速。谨此拜复，并希望言时颁，以匡不逮。此请夏安！
