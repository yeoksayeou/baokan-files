In addition, an industry and commerce section has been added to specifically manage industrial construction, commercial administration, and cooperative undertakings. A transportation section has also been added to specifically manage highway and road construction, telephones, and other work. This section also has a pre-established civil engineering section, specially hiring dozens of technical personnel to be specifically responsible for subgrade and bridge surveying and engineering design. In addition, the construction department has also established a technical guidance and research office, specifically hiring various agricultural and industrial technicians and experts to conduct specialized research. The administrative office has now issued a call, inviting various scientific experts and technicians to come and participate in the construction of the new society, and has formulated preferential treatment measures for technical personnel. At present, 31 technical personnel have been hired for various tasks.
