Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 5th. Model teacher Sun Yangchun, who was awarded at the Central China Propaganda and Education Conference, has methods for reforming private schools that are well worth emulating by private schools in various regions. Sun is from Yin Dai Village, Xinghua County, Suwan Border Region, and established a private school in his village. After studying at the county's private school teacher training class, he first conducted self-criticism, believing that it was wrong to beat and scold students in the past, and apologized to the students who had been beaten. Subsequently, whenever a student made a mistake, Sun always patiently persuaded them with a gentle attitude. For example, while persuading a student who tore up a book to admit their mistake, he also helped them mend the book. At the criticism meeting, he mobilized everyone to reason calmly, which moved the naughty students to improve. The school initially taught the Four Books. After Sun returned this time, he planned to change to teaching new books, but fearing opposition from parents, he first inserted a few lectures on the new books, winning the students' approval. Then, he inspired the students to hold a meeting to discuss how to persuade their own parents. At the meeting, they first collected the parents' opinions against the new books, and then Sun came up with reasons to refute them, which the students then presented at home. For example, if a parent said that only the Four Books were useful and the new books were useless, the student would say, "You can't learn how to write contracts, accounts, or letters from the Four Books." If a parent said that the new books were too vulgar, the student would say, "Government notices and correspondence all use the vulgar language in the new books." Initially, only two parents were persuaded. Sun then asked these two students to switch to reading the new books. After Sun's continuous persuasion, the entire school completely switched to reading the new books. During the busy farming season, Sun asked the students about their family's production situation, and then taught the students the names of people and workers (such as rice transplanters, wheat harvesters, mud carriers, etc.), and also taught them how to use the abacus, so that the students could go home that day and help their families with bookkeeping and accounting. This method of combining learning with application was well received by the parents. One conservative parent said, "Teacher Sun's school is good in every way, but singing is not good." Sun first explained to the parents that the content of the children's songs was upright, and also said, "The children get impatient after studying for a long time, and they either fight or make noise, so it's better to teach them to sing." Sun's method of reforming the private school ultimately won unanimous support from the parents. Private schools near the village have all followed Sun Yangchun's methods and have been converted into new-style primary schools.

    改造私垫办法高
    感动顽皮学生，说服守旧家长。
    【新华社淮阴五日电】在华中宣教会议上受奖之模范教师孙阳春，其改造私垫办法颇值得各地私塾效法。孙氏系苏皖边区兴化县殷戴村人，在本村设立私塾，他在县私塾师训练班学习后，首先即进行自我批评，认为过去打骂学生是错误的，并向被打学生道歉。嗣后凡有学生犯了错误，孙氏总是耐心说服，态度和蔼，如一面说服撕毁书籍的学生认错，一面又帮他把书补上，并在检讨会上发动大家平心静气的说理，感动得顽皮学生改好了。该塾初教四书，孙氏此次回来后，即拟改教新书，又恐家长反对，即先插讲几次新书，博得学生同意后，便启发学生开会讨论，如何说服其自己父母，会上先搜集家长反对新书的意见，再由孙氏想出反驳之理由，由学生分别回家提出。如家长说惟四书有用、新书无用。学生就说：“写契约、写账、写信从四书上念不出来的”。家长称新书太俗，学生就说：“官府的布告，来往的信件，均用新书上的俗话”。开初只有二个家长被说服，孙氏就叫该两学生改读新书，各家长经孙氏不断说服后，全塾即完全改读新书。在农忙时，孙氏向学生询问其家中生产情形，然后将人名、工人（如栽秧工、割麦工、挑泥工等）等字教学生，并教会学生打算盘，使学生当天回家能为家中记账算账。此种学与用结合的方法，颇受到家长的拥护，有个守旧家长说：“孙先生的书房什么都好，但就是唱歌一项不好”。孙氏首先向家长说明小孩唱歌词之内容正派，并且说：“孩子念久了就不耐烦，不是打架就是吵闹，不如教他们唱歌。”孙氏改造私塾办法，终获家长们一致拥护。该村附近私塾，均纷纷按照孙阳春的办法改成新式的小学。
