Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 16th: This reporter visited General Lin Biao, Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic Allied Forces, in a certain location yesterday. The General answered the following questions:

    Q: What is the current situation?

    A: Since our army voluntarily ceded Changchun in pursuit of peace, the Kuomintang reactionaries have not ceased their offensive. However, the more territory they seize, the more dispersed their forces become, making them weak everywhere, and the situation becomes even more unfavorable for them. After the retreat from Changchun, we eliminated five or six of their regiments in the vicinity of Haicheng, Chaoyang, Anshan, Dashiqiao, Heishizhen, Huadian, and Jiaohe. Yet, not a single company of our army was destroyed after the Battle of Siping Street. The Kuomintang reactionaries fabricate rumors and brag about their victories every time they occupy an empty city, which is nothing but self-deception. In reality, the victory or defeat in war lies not in the gain or loss of a single place, but in the growth or decline of living forces. The current announcement of a fifteen-day ceasefire is the result of the nationwide people's firm opposition to civil war and their demand for peace. However, from the perspective of the Kuomintang reactionaries, this ceasefire may be a temporary one because they are unable to attack, and they are preparing for a new offensive. Currently, in the local areas where they can fight, they have not abandoned their offensive. They occupied Faku a few days ago, and on the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th, they were still bombing and attacking in Jiaohe and other places. Therefore, this temporary ceasefire, on the part of the Kuomintang reactionaries, may be in order to wait for reinforcements, to consolidate occupied positions, to repair railways and highways needed for the offensive, to recapture the towns and villages liberated by us, and to suppress the anti-civil war uprising of the Yunnan army. We have always hoped for peace. The Kuomintang reactionaries practice despotism and dictatorship in the Northeast, oppressing the people and attempting to turn the Northeast into a fascist-ruled area. They do not respect the will of the people and ignore the power of the people. We firmly oppose this! We must make the Northeast a democratic Northeast. We have repeatedly put forward peaceful and democratic demands and are willing to cooperate with the Kuomintang in the Northeast, but this has been rejected. They want to eliminate the people's forces by armed force, and we have no choice but to defend ourselves. The armed forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries have been eliminated in considerable numbers. If they continue to fight, even more reactionary forces will be eliminated. If they concentrate all their efforts to attack certain areas, then vast areas will be in the hands of the people. If they launch a dispersed offensive, they will easily suffer the fate of being defeated one by one by us. This is a truth. No matter whether the reactionaries launch a dispersed offensive or a concentrated offensive, we have ways to deal with them. However, the continuation of the war is detrimental to the people. For the sake of the people's interests, we advocate achieving peace at any time. Peace can be achieved as long as the Kuomintang army does not attack. Otherwise, peace can only be achieved when the reactionaries are unable to continue their offensive.

    Q: What is the significance of the uprising of the 184th Division?

    A: When the 184th Division was in Yunnan, it advocated democracy and opposed dictatorship. This time, the Kuomintang authorities forcibly transferred them to the Northeast to carry out a civil war, which was against the will of the officers and soldiers of the 184th Division. Therefore, during the Battle of Haicheng, General Pan Shuoduan personally led a regiment to revolt. This is a major blow to those who are enthusiastic about civil war. From this, it can be fully seen that many of the troops under the command of the Kuomintang authorities are unwilling to engage in civil war. The uprising of General Pan and others has provided an example and an outlet for the troops forced to participate in the civil war, and has increased our confidence in resolutely opposing the reactionary faction's actions to expand the civil war. If the civil war continues, there will be more such uprisings, which could become a factor in ending the civil war.

    Q: What is the situation of the Democratic Allied Army's weapons? Can you tell us?

    A: There are three sources: The first is Japanese weapons. Japan had many warehouses in the Northeast, leaving behind weapons. Many ordinary people also brought guns with them when they joined the army. The second is American weapons, which were seized from the Kuomintang reactionaries. The third is what was seized from the Japanese and puppet troops during the War of Resistance. What is different now from the War of Resistance is that there is more American equipment. Some divisions and regiments of the Democratic Allied Army are equipped with American weapons.

### 关于东北目前形势  林彪将军答记者问

    关于东北目前形势
    林彪将军答记者问
    【新华社哈尔滨十六日电】本社记者，昨赴某地访民主联军总司令林彪将军，对记者所提问题，答复如下：
    问：目前形势如何？
    答：自我军为求和平实现，自动让出长春后，国民党反动派并未停止进攻，但侵占地区越来越多，他的兵力就越分散，而处处薄弱，形势亦就更加不利。长春撤退后，我们在海城、朝阳、鞍山、大石桥、黑石镇、桦甸、蛟河附近等地，一共消灭了他五六个团，而我军在四平街战斗后，却未被消灭一个连。国民党反动派每占领一个空城，即造谣吹嘘自己胜利，实际不过是自欺欺人而已。其实战争胜利与否，不在一地之得失，而在有生力量之消长。此次宣布十五天停战，是全国人民坚决反对内战要求和平的结果。但就国民党反动派的企图来说，可能是暂时无法进攻的停战，是准备作新的进攻的停战，目前在他们能打的局部地区，仍未放弃进攻。他们于日前占领法库后，九、十、十一、十二等日，还在蛟河等地轰炸与进攻。因此这次暂时停战，在国民党反动派方面，可能是为了等待援军，为了巩固占领阵地，为修复进攻所需之铁路与公路，为了夺回我解放的诸城镇，为了镇压云南军队的反内战的起义。我们一向希望和平，国民党反动派在东北专制独裁压迫人民，企图把东北变为法西斯的统治地区，不尊重人民的意志，无视人民的力量，我们坚决反对！我们一定要使东北成为民主的东北，我们一再提出和平民主要求，愿与国民党在东北合作，但遭到拒绝。他们想以武装消灭人民力量，我们不得不自卫。国民党反动派的武装，已被消灭不少。如他继续打下去，反动力量会被消灭更多。如他集中全力进攻某些地区，则广大地区即在人民手中。如他分散进攻，则易于遭我各个击破的命运。这是一个真理，不管反动派分散进攻，或集中全力进攻，我们都有办法对付。但战争下去，对人民不利，为了人民利益，我们任何时候，都主张实现和平。只要国民党军不进攻，即可实现和平。否则只有使反动派无力继续进攻时，才能实现和平。
    问：一八四师起义的意义如何？
    答：一八四师在云南时，是主张民主反对独裁的，此次被国民党当局强迫调到关外进行内战，是违背一八四师官兵意志的，故在海城战斗中，潘朔端将军亲率一个团起义，这对那些内战热狂者，是一个很大的打击。从这里可以充分看出国民党当局所指挥下的部队，有许多是不愿内战的。潘将军等的起义，使被迫参加内战的部队，有了榜样和出路，提高了我们坚决反对反动派扩大内战行动的信心。如内战继续下去，这种起义，还会更多，可以变为结束内战的一个因素。
    问：民主联军武器情形如何，可否是告？
    答：来源有三种：第一种，是日本武器，日本在东北有许多仓库，遗留有武器，老百姓参加部队，也多带枪来。第二种，是美国武器，是从国民党反动派手中缴获过来的。第三种，是抗战中从日本和伪军那里夺来的。现在和抗战中不同的，就是多了美国装备。民主联军已有一些师和团，就是美国装备。
