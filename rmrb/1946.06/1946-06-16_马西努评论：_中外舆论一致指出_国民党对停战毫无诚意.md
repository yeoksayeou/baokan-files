    Masinu's Commentary:
    Chinese and Foreign Public Opinion Unanimously Points Out That the Kuomintang Has No Sincerity Regarding the Ceasefire
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th] Moscow broadcast today Masinu cited Chinese and foreign public opinion, commenting on the fifteen-day ceasefire, saying: Chinese and foreign public opinion unanimously pointed out that the Kuomintang had no sincerity regarding the ceasefire. Shanghai's Wenhui Bao pointed out: The Kuomintang's demands of the CCP are not an attitude of mutual respect. The Kuomintang authorities refuse to grant other political parties equal status, therefore the fifteen-day ceasefire order cannot be smoothly implemented. Chinese newspapers are worried that the entire problem cannot be resolved within the short fifteen days, while all Chinese democratic parties believe that the Northeast issue must be resolved together with the entire political problem in order to be resolved. Leaders of the China Democratic League unanimously believe that the Northeast issue is not only a military issue, but is related to the entire political problem, and it is difficult to imagine that the political problem can be resolved within a short week. New York radio broadcast stated: On the second day of the ceasefire, Du Yuming issued a statement: openly threatening the CCP that if stability cannot be achieved within fifteen days, the Kuomintang will resume seizing the entire Manchuria. The broadcast continued: The CCP representative in Nanjing called this statement an open declaration of civil war. Xinwen Bao reported: The ceasefire order took effect at noon on June 7th, and the Kuomintang army continued to attack in Manchuria. Chinese democrats believe that these facts prove that the Kuomintang authorities have no sincerity. At that time, Chinese newspapers strongly opposed the United States undermining China's sovereignty because someone suggested to Marshall that he act as an arbitrator to mediate China's internal affairs. Wenhui Bao stated: All problems should be solved by ourselves, not handed over to the Americans. Don't let the United States become the ruler of China. The newspaper firmly stated: If there is no foreign interference, the Chinese people will handle their own affairs very well, and foreign interference actually hinders China's rejuvenation.

    马西努评论：
    中外舆论一致指出
    国民党对停战毫无诚意
    【新华社延安十三日电】莫斯科今日广播马西努引证中外舆论，对十五天停战评称：中外舆论一致指出：国民党对停战毫无诚意。上海文汇报指出：国民党要求中共这样那样，这不是相互尊重的态度。国民党当局拒绝予其它政党平等地位，因此十五天停战命令，不能顺利实行。中国报纸担心在短短的十五天内，不能解决整个问题，而中国各民主政党都认为东北问题，必须与整个政治问题一同解决，始能解决。中国民主同盟领袖一致认为东北问题不仅是军事问题，而是关系到整个政治问题，在短短一周内，对政治问题能得到解决，是很难设想的。纽约无线电广播称：在停战的第二日杜聿明即发表声明：公开威胁中共，如果十五天内，不能达到稳定，国民党将恢复夺取整个满洲。广播继称：南京中共代表关于该声明称之为公开宣布内战。新闻报报导：停战命令于六月七日中午开始生效，国民党军即在满洲继续进攻。中国民主人士认为这些事实，证明国民党当局毫无诚意。当时中国报纸纷纷反对美国损害中国的主权。因为有人向马歇尔提议要他充当调解中国内政的仲裁者。文汇报表示：一切问题，应自己来解决，不是让给美国人。不要美国成为中国的统治者。该报坚称：如果没有外国人的干涉，中国人民便会很好地处理自己的家务，而外国的干涉实是妨碍中国的复兴。
