　　Production Increased in Fengfeng Mining District During May Production Competition
    Changzhi Trade Union Summarizes Labor Model Movement, Emerging 46 Labor Models.
    [This Newspaper Reports] Under the slogan of "Developing the Construction of Mines Movement," × thousand × hundred × number of workers in the Fengfeng Mining District, all plunged into the Red May Great Production Movement. The wave of the movement started from Taianjing on the 7th, and quickly swept through Tongshunjing and Shuanghejing. In the first week, 80% of the workers participated, and in the second week it entered its climax, reaching its peak at the end of May. The wells competed with each other in terms of output. The Zhang Jinsheng group in Tongshunjing not only produced a lot of coal but also built the roadways very well. The company awarded them 25,000 yuan in the first week. The fourth group in the same kiln didn't quite believe it, so they sent representatives to inspect. The representatives were convinced by the facts of the Zhang Jinsheng group and also learned new methods of coal mining and roadway construction. This news quickly spread throughout the groups, and from then on, the roadway construction in this well was better than at any time before. The workers in the South Main Roadway of Shuanghejing were all old hands, but they missed three days because they went home to attend a meeting and felt a bit discouraged. In the first two days, they averaged 40% to 60% of their output, while other kilns had already reached 90%. The cadres became anxious, so they led the workers to conduct self-criticism. Everyone cheered up again to win the banner. Shi Changming, a branch cadre, pushed the coal cart himself and found half-filled and one-tenth-filled carts. Since it was a waste of manpower to use two people for the same task, he reduced the half-filled carts to one person, so that every labor force could exert its effectiveness. Towhead Han Zhihui gave good furniture to the workers to use and used the bad furniture himself. When pulling coal, the average worker pulled 60 jin, but he used a specially made large basket to pull 150 jin. He pulled twice as many times as others, and he once proposed a competition to all coal miners in the mine. In the climax of the competition, the workers of the first branch first created a record of averaging 110% of the daily quota per person, and finally reached 120%. The original plan was 50%, which has exceeded 140%. The original plan envisioned 30 meters of roadways, but the result was extended to 50 meters. The iron factory divided the workers into three shifts to intensify work, ensuring that the workers had sufficient machines and furniture. In the past, the surveyors who did not go down the pit for a month also went down the kiln all day long during the movement, carrying tapes, hanging centerlines, guiding the workers to mine and directing them towards construction of roadways, ensuring the safety of the workers. Through the efforts of all employees, the quality of products and the labor efficiency of workers have been unprecedentedly improved. The coal produced now not only cannot find large pieces, but even fist-sized pieces have not been found. The loading capacity has increased from 1,000 kilograms to 1,290 kilograms. The 360-meter roadway has increased from 4 tons to 5.76 tons per person per day. The amount of coal pulled per day has increased from 2.07 tons to 4.1 tons. Each worker has increased from 3.5 tons to 5.35 tons per day. The average total output has increased from 0.4 tons to 0.64 tons per worker per day, an increase of 60% compared to last month. The movement ended at the end of May, and a general inspection and evaluation will be carried out after June 1st, which is expected to be announced soon.
    [This Newspaper Changzhi News] The Changzhi Municipal Federation of Trade Unions summarized the labor model movement of various factories in the city in May. The production of 26 factories in the city has exceeded the plan proposed during the "May 1st" celebration in the past month, and 46 model workers have emerged. The output of the iron factory increased from 7,000 pieces in April to 15,000 pieces. Zhang Hanqing, a carpenter in the factory, made 8,000 wooden machines in April, and completed 17,000 pieces in May. The 42 workers in the factory automatically processed 2,479 pieces in May. The production volume of various textile factories has also increased by one-third. The output of Huaqiang Cloth Factory increased to 50%, and the output of the machine repair factory increased to 100% after changing the plan last month. The paper mill increased to 25%. Due to the improvement of workers' skills, the quality has also improved compared with the past, and it can save raw materials and reduce costs. The foundry department of the factory saved more than 3,000 jin of materials in May, and the products are more durable than in the past, and the number of damages is 80% lower than in the past. Due to the improvement of technology, Hua Xin Cloth Factory reduced the weight of a piece of cloth from 2.5 jin to 2.2 jin. Now the apprentices in each factory are progressing rapidly, and the established rules of the three-year apprenticeship system have been broken. The basic reason for the victory of this labor model production increase movement is that although the living conditions of the workers have improved and their awareness has increased, the dividend system of exceeding the standard production volume has also greatly encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for labor.

　　五月生产竞赛中
    峰峰矿区产量提高
    长治工会总结劳模运动，涌现劳动模范四十六名。
    【本报讯】峰峰矿区×千×百×个职工在“开展建设矿山运动”口号下：全体投入红五月大生产运动中，运动浪潮于七日自太安井掀起，通顺井、双和井迅即卷入。第一礼拜已有百分之八十的职工参加第二礼拜即进入高潮，至五月底达最高峰，各井间在产量上互相展开竞赛；通顺井张金生组不仅出煤多；而且巷道作得很好，公司方面在第一礼拜中奖给二万五千元，同窑第四组不很相信，于是派代表检查，代表们被张金生组的事实说服了，也学会掘煤建巷的新办法，这个消息迅速传遍各组，从此这个井的巷道建筑比以前任何时期还好。双和井南大巷的工人都是老干家，因为回家赶会误了三天，有些泄气，头两天平均每人出四成到六成，别的窑已达到九成了。干部们着了急，于是带领工友进行检讨，大家重新振作要夺锦旗。分会干部石长明自已推罐（运煤车）发现了半成罐和一成罐，同样用两个人有些浪费人力，就把半成罐减成一个人推，使每个劳动力发挥到实效。拖头韩智慧把好家具给工人使，自己使用坏家具；拉煤时一般工人拉六十斤，他用特制大筐拉一百五十斤，别人拉一回，他就拉两回，他曾向全矿挖煤工人提出竞赛。在竞赛高潮中，第一支部的工人首先创造每天每人平均一成一的纪录，最后到达一成二。原定计划为零点五成，已超过百分之一百四。原计划假想巷道为三十公尺，结果延展到五十公尺。铁工厂把工人分作三班加紧工作，保证工人有足够的机器和家具。过去一月不下坑的测量人员，在运动中也成天提了皮尺子下窑，挂中线，指导工人采掘方向，和建设巷道，保障了工人安全。经全体职工努力，产品质量和工人劳动效率都空前提高，现在出的煤不但见不到大块，连拳头大的也没有发现过，装罐由一千公斤增至一千二百九十公斤。三百六十米的巷道由每人每天拉四吨增加到五·七六吨，拉＠碌的一天由二·○七吨增加到四·一吨。每工每天由三·五增到五·三五吨。总平均产量每工每天由○·四吨增至○·六四，较上月增加百分之六十，运动至五月底结束，自六月一日以后进行总检查与评选，近日即可望揭晓。
    【本报长治讯】长治市职工会总结五月份本市各工厂劳动模范运动，本市二十六个工厂一月来生产均超过“五一”纪念时所提出的计划，涌现模范劳动者四十六人。铁工厂出品，由四月份七千件增至一万五千件，该厂木工张汉卿，四月份造木械八千件，五月份竟完成一万七千件。该厂四十二个工人五月份自动加工二千四百七十九个。各纺织厂生产量亦均提高三分之一。华强布厂产量提高到百分之五十，机型修理厂自上月改变计划后，提高产量到百分之百。造纸厂提高到百分之二十五。由于工人技术的改进，质量亦较前提高，并能节省原料，减低成本，该工厂翻沙部在五月份节省材料三千余斤，出品亦较过去耐用，损坏数较过去低百分之八十。华新布厂由于技术的改进，使一匹布的重量由二斤半减轻到二斤二两。现各厂学徒进步很快，并打破三年学徒制的成规。此次劳模增产运动胜利的基本原因，虽由于工人生活改善，认识的提高，实持超过标准生产量的分红制度，亦对工人劳动热情有很大鼓舞。
