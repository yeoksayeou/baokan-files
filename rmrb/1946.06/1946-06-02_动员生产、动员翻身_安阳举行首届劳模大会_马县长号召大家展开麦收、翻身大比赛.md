[Our newspaper, Anyang, news] The first Anyang Emancipated Masses Labor Model Conference, centered on mobilizing production (protecting the wheat harvest) and mobilizing emancipation, was held in Shuiye Town on May 21st. Two hundred and fifty labor models and heroes from the new and old districts participated. These people were active elements in leading the masses to emancipation during the rent reduction and interest rate reduction movement. Now they have maintained their glorious tradition and have become heroes leading the emancipated masses in large-scale production. Therefore, on the first day of the conference, the sound of gongs and drums celebrating by the masses did not stop all day. Various agencies and organizations also presented brocade banners one after another, and groups of elementary school students happily hung big red flowers on the chests of the heroes. Just as the masses hoped for them, more than two hundred heroes enthusiastically discussed methods of leading the masses to help each other in production to achieve emancipation during the two-day conference, and exchanged valuable experiences of the masses in the new and old districts. Finally, County Head Ma made a concluding report. He called on everyone to quickly carry out three tasks after returning, based on the conference discussions: (1) The wheat is almost ripe. The Kuomintang reactionaries and puppet troops are trying their best to steal our wheat and starve the people of the liberated areas. The heroes must actively lead the masses to harvest, thresh, and hide the wheat quickly, and not let them steal a single grain. (2) After returning, consult with the village cadres. Villages where the masses have been thoroughly emancipated should organize and intensify large-scale production. Those who have not been thoroughly emancipated should continue to work hard to achieve thorough emancipation before the wheat harvest. (3) After returning, each village should launch a large production (protecting the wheat harvest) emancipation competition. When the Labor Model Conference is held again in the fall, everyone will come to judge and see who has the greatest ability and the highest methods.

    动员生产、动员翻身
    安阳举行首届劳模大会
    马县长号召大家展开麦收、翻身大比赛
    【本报安阳讯】以动员生产（保卫麦收），动员翻身为中心的安阳翻身群众第一届劳模大会，于五月廿一日在水冶镇举行。参加新老区劳模英雄二百五十人，这些人，在减租减息运动中是领导群众翻身的积极分子。现在他们保持了自己光荣的传统，又成为领导翻身群众大生产的英雄了。因此开会的第一天，群众庆贺的锣鼓声，整日不停。各机关各团体，亦纷纷赠献锦旗，一群一群的小学生，把大红花欢天喜地的挂在英雄们的胸上。正如群众对他们的希望一样，二百余位英雄在两天的大会中，热烈讨论了领导群众互助生产来翻身的办法，并交流了新老区群众的宝贵经验。最后该县马县长作总结报告，他号召大家回去后，要根据大会讨论，迅速作三件工作：（一）麦子快熟了，国民党反动派和伪军，正千方百计想抢走咱们的麦子，饿死解放区人民，英雄们要积极领导群众快收、快打、快藏，不让他们抢走一粒粮。（二）回去后，和村干部商量，群众翻身彻底的村庄，要组织起来加紧大生产。没有翻彻底的，要在麦收前继续努力彻底翻身。（三）回去后，各村要展开一个生产（保卫麦收）翻身的大比赛，到秋后再开劳模大会时，大家都来作评判，看谁的本事大、办法高。
