    【This Newspaper, Handan, 3rd】In order to stop the Kuomintang army from repeatedly violating orders and attacking the Yuedong and Yubei areas of our border region, General Liu Bocheng, commander of the military region here, sent a memorandum to the Peiping Mediation Executive Department and the Xinxiang Central Group on the 2nd. The document emphasized the Kuomintang army's repeated acts of violence in attacking the Eighth Route Army. Our army has repeatedly protested and requested that a team be sent to the battlefield for mediation to stop the Kuomintang army's attacks, but the Kuomintang has unreasonably refused. General Liu now "solemnly declares once again: Our army still sincerely supports the executive team going to Yuedong and all conflict areas for mediation, to determine right and wrong, stop the conflict, restore the positions as of midnight on January 13, and punish those who provoked the civil war." The memorandum concludes with "a warning to the warmongers: If the Kuomintang army persists in its civil war policy and does not immediately withdraw from the areas it has occupied and restore its positions as of 10:00 PM on January 13, then the Kuomintang will bear full responsibility for all unfortunate events arising therefrom."
    【Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 2nd】General Nie Rongzhen, commander of the Jinchaji Military Region, has submitted a memorandum to the three members of the Peiping Military Mediation Department regarding the Kuomintang army's violation of the truce agreement and its mobilization of main forces to launch large-scale attacks on the Jinxi Shengfang City on the north bank of the Yongding River in the Jizhong Liberated Area and the Xianghe area in eastern Hebei. He pointed out that, based on the scale of the Kuomintang army's troop movements, it can be determined that the Kuomintang's 11th War Zone has planned to tear up the truce agreement. He demanded that the Military Mediation Department immediately lodge a serious protest with the Kuomintang authorities. If it cannot quickly stop all attacks and withdraw from all areas occupied in violation of the agreement within a set time limit, then the truce agreement has been completely torn up by the Kuomintang army, and the people and soldiers of Jinchaji have reached the end of their forbearance and will rise up in self-defense, launching counterattacks against the Kuomintang army from all sides. The Kuomintang side should bear all the responsibility for the consequences.

    刘伯承、聂荣臻两将军向军调部提出备忘录
    国民党军不断进犯解放区，如不立即撤返原防，我将被迫奋起自卫
    【本报邯郸三日电】为制止国民党军一再违令向我边区之豫东与豫北等区进攻，此间军区司令员刘伯承将军于二日致送北平调处执行部与新乡中心小组备忘录一份，该文着重指出国民党军屡次向八路军进攻之暴行，我军曾多次提出抗议，并要求派遣小组前往战地调处，以停止国民党军进攻，均遭国民党无理拒绝。现刘将军“特再次郑重声明：我军仍亟诚拥护执行小组前往豫东及一切冲突地点调处，以判明是非，停止冲突，恢复一月十三日午夜位置，并给挑动内战者以处分。”该备忘录最后“向好战者提出警告，若国民党军仍坚持内战方针，不立即自侵占我地区撤退，恢复元月十三日亥时位置，则一切由此发生之不幸事件，概由国民党负完全责任。”
    【新华社张家口二日电】晋察冀军区司令员聂荣臻将军，为国民党军违犯停战协定，调动主力连续向我冀中解放区永定河北岸津西胜芳市及冀东香河地区大规模进攻，已向北平军调部三委员提出备忘录，指出：依据国民党军之调动军队的规模，已可判明国民党第十一战区有计划之撕毁停战协定的行为，要求军调部立即向国民党当局提出严重抗议，如不能迅速停止一切进攻，并限期撤出所有违约侵占之地区，则停战协定既被国民党军撕毁无余，晋察冀军民已忍无可忍，即将奋起自卫，从各方面予国民党军以反击，所有后果之责任，全应由国民党方面负之。
