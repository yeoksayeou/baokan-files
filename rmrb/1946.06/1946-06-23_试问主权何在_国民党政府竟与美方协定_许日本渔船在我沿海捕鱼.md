　　Where is Sovereignty?
    The Kuomintang Government Actually Agreed with the U.S. to Allow Japanese Fishing Boats to Fish in Our Coastal Waters
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] Regarding MacArthur's request that the Chinese government allow Japanese fishing boats to fish in Chinese coastal waters; according to a report in the Dagong Bao on May 21st: The Kuomintang government has reached an agreement with representatives of MacArthur's headquarters, allowing 40 Japanese fishing boats to fish for one year in the so-called "international waters" between China and Japan—any area beyond three nautical miles from the coast is considered "international waters," which is actually the Chinese coast. The Shanghai Wenhui Bao held a weekly forum on May 16th, and participants unanimously expressed their opposition to this. Xu Panyun stated: Allowing Japanese to fish in Chinese coastal waters is a loss of rights and interests. If Japanese fishing boats are still allowed to operate in coastal waters now, "what was the war of resistance fought for?" Li Dongxiang pointed out: "The government should not be afraid of powerful forces and fail to safeguard even this bit of sovereignty!" The chairman of the forum also pointed out: The guarantee of the fishing industry relies on a democratic foundation, and it is impossible for the current government not to bow to American authority. The newspaper also devoted more than a page on the 15th to publishing the content of the forum, with the title "The Fishing Industry Must Not Be Occupied by Others."

　　试问主权何在
    国民党政府竟与美方协定  许日本渔船在我沿海捕鱼
    【新华社延安二十日电】关于麦克阿瑟要求中国政府允许日本渔船在中国沿海捕鱼事；据大公报五月二十一日讯：国民党政府已与麦克阿瑟总部代表，成立协定，准许日本渔船四十艘，在中日间所谓“公海”——距海岸三海里以外，均可称为“公海”，实即中国沿海——捕鱼一年。上海文汇报于五月十六日举行星期座谈会，与会者对此，一致表示反对。许蟠云发言谓：中国沿海向任日人捕鱼，利权丧失。如果现在还任日本渔船来沿海活动，“抗战的血，究是为什么而流的”？李东芗指出：“政府不应畏于强权而连这一点主权都不能维护”！座谈会主任并指出：渔业的保障，靠民主的基础，要目前的政府不向美国威权低头，那是不可能的。该报并于十五日开辟一版多的地位，刊载座谈内容，标题为“渔业不容他人侵占”。
