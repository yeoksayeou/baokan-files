[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] In the past month or so, commerce in Handan has seen considerable development. The number of established merchants has increased from 1,019 at the end of April to over 1,300. The largest increases are in the general merchandise sector and certain small-scale industries (cigarette rolling, chalk making, etc.). Many owners of foreign goods and sundries stores, as well as foreign cloth shops, have brought out previously stored goods, making the shelves appear more abundant than before.

A reporter interviewed officials in charge of industry and commerce at the municipal government and several merchants, learning that there are several reasons for the recent commercial development:

1.  Since the liberation of Handan, merchants increasingly feel the freedom of trade. In the past, the enemy and puppet regime imposed various controls and extortions, causing merchants to shy away. Today, merchants generally have no such concerns.

2.  The burden on industry and commerce has been reduced. The government stipulates that taxes begin to be levied on profits exceeding 5,000 yuan, with a maximum tax rate of no more than 30%. This is worlds apart from the heavy taxes and levies of the enemy and puppet era.

3.  Merchants are increasingly understanding the government's various policies, which is a crucial key to commercial development. In the past, many merchants had a "fear of struggle" mentality, and therefore were unwilling to operate freely. Since seeing the fact that our government is making every effort to support and develop commerce, many merchants have gradually moved from initial observation and hesitation to freely developing their businesses.

It is said that the current general business firms are more substantial than in the enemy and puppet era. At that time, the largest business firms were cotton agencies. They purchased cotton for the enemy and only obtained meager profits during the transfer. General merchants lost money in terms of goods, even though they made money in terms of capital due to the daily price increases. In addition, excessive donations and taxes made it extremely difficult to maintain operations. Today, the phenomenon of capital outflow has almost disappeared. Generally, merchants earn what they can, which is far more substantial than in the past.

The reporter asked several relevant people, "What are the current demands of merchants?" According to them, the greatest demand of industrialists and business people is to strengthen transportation, reduce freight costs, so that raw materials and energy can be continuously supplied, and products can be sold as quickly as possible, to accelerate circulation, reduce costs, and suppress prices. Merchants demand prompt market information and rapid freight, to better grasp market conditions and earn more money. Secondly, industrialists and business people generally demand stable prices, so that legitimate trade can obtain reliable profits and speculation can be reduced.

    贸易自由负担减轻
    邯市商家增加三百
    当前要求加强运输，灵通商情，以加速流转，减低成本
    【本报特讯】最近一个多月以来，邯郸商业又有相当发展，座商已由四月底之一千零十九家增至一千三百余家。增加最多者为杂货业及若干小手工业（卷烟、制粉笔等）。许多洋广杂货及洋布店的老板都把过去存藏的货物搬取出来，货架显得比以前充裕。记者访晤市政府工商工作的负责人及若干商人，得悉最近商业发展有几个原因：一、邯郸解放后，商人日益感觉贸易的自由。过去敌伪多方统制讹诈，商人望而却步，今日一般商人已完全无此顾虑。二、工商业负担减轻。政府规定红利在五千元以上者开始征税，最高税率不超过百分之卅。与过去敌伪时代苛税重重之情况比较，实有天壤之别。三、商人对政府的各种政策日益了解，此为商业发展的重要关键。过去许多商人存在着“怕斗争”的心理，因而不愿放手经营。自从看到我政府对商业竭力扶助发展的事实后，许多商人因而从最初某种程度的观望犹豫，逐渐放手发展自己的业务。据称：目前一般商号均较敌伪时代殷实。彼时最大商号为棉花代理店，它们替敌人承买棉花，只是在转手之间得此唾余。一般商人则因物价一日数涨，在资金数额上是赚了钱，但以货物折合却亏了本。加以捐税过大，极难维持。今日资金外流现象已近绝迹，一般商人赚一个是一个，比较过去远为殷实。记者曾以“目前商人要求为何”询问若干有关人士，据称；目前工商业家最大要求为加强运输，减低运费，使原料能源源供给，产品能尽速行销，以加速流转，减低成本，抑低物价。商人则要求市情灵通，货运迅速，以便更好的掌握行情，多赚些钱。其次，工商业家均要求平稳物价，以便正当的贸易能获得可靠利润，并可减少投机。
