　　American Goods Dumping
    Shanghai Industrial Crisis Severe
    Many Factories Unable to Maintain Operations and Preparing to Close
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd] Shanghai News: As a result of American goods dumping, the crisis in Shanghai's industry is becoming increasingly serious. Currently, foreign goods are generally three to five times cheaper than domestic products, and domestic products are unable to compete. Shanghai's canned food industry, leather goods industry, wool textile industry, etc., are all facing difficulties in maintaining operations due to this impact. Wool textile factories and other factories have already requested the Social Affairs Bureau to lay off and dismiss workers. Other factories will implement shutdowns. Even the paper mills in Shanghai taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs are losing money due to this reason. Bureaucrats and compradors, seeing no profit, simply no longer maintain production. The ministry originally took over more than fifteen paper mills in Shanghai, but only seven were operating. Now, those seven factories are also about to close.

　　美国商品倾销
    上海工业危机严重
    许多工厂无法维持准备关门
    【新华社延安二十二日电】沪讯：由于美货倾销的结果，上海工业之危机日趋严重，目前外货一般较国产品价格低三倍至五倍，国产品无力与之竞争。上海罐头食品业、皮件业、呢绒业等，因受此种影响，均有无法维持之势。毛纺织厂及其他一部分工厂，已向社会局请求裁员、遣散工人。另一部分工厂，则将实行停业，甚至经济部在沪接收的纸厂，也因这一原因而亏累。官僚买办因无利可图，索性不再维持其生产。该部在沪原接收纸厂十五个以上，本只开工七厂，现该七厂亦将关门。
