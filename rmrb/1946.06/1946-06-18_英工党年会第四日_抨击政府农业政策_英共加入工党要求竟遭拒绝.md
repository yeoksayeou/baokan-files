Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 14th: According to Reuters from Portsmouth: At the Labour Party's annual conference on the 13th, during the fourth day of meetings, delegates fiercely opposed the Labour government's current agricultural policies. Delegates passed a resolution criticizing the government's agricultural policies by a large majority: The conference resolved: "Based on the opinions of this meeting, the time has come for the government to implement agricultural policies more in accordance with the Labour Party's adopted program, and to further improve employment conditions." It is said that this move has caused great surprise among British authorities. After the meeting, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry held meetings with agricultural representatives. Another dispute between the British government and Labour Party conference delegates concerned the conscription law. Following the agricultural issue, the conference also passed a resolution opposing the conscription law. However, Lord Privy Seal Greenwood strongly defended the law, claiming it was necessary to "fulfill certain obligations." After a heated debate, the resolution opposing the bill was defeated.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 14th: The 45th annual conference of the British Labour Party, held in Portsmouth (in southern England, previously mistranslated as Booth Saintes), discussed amending the party constitution on the 12th. At the meeting, the representative of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, with 910,000 members, proposed an amendment to the party constitution: to accept the Communist Party's request to join the Labour Party on the understanding that the Communist Party recognizes the Labour Party's constitution. After a fierce debate, according to Agence France-Presse: the proposal put forward by the party's executive committee was ultimately passed with 2,473,000 votes to 667,000 votes: to amend the party constitution, stipulating that no separate political group shall be accepted into the Labour Party. According to the program announced by the Labour Party in 1908, any group and workers who recognize the party's program and pay party dues can join the party. In order to unite and consolidate the strength of the working class and promote the progress of the Labour Party, the Communist Party of Great Britain has requested to join the Labour Party twelve times. Although this request of the British Communist Party has resonated with many members within the Labour Party, it has been rejected by the party's leading bodies dominated by the right wing. The Labour Party's adoption of the amendment to the party constitution not only closes the door to the British Communist Party's request to join the Labour Party, but this situation will inevitably arouse opposition from progressive forces within the British Labour Party, intensifying its internal contradictions.

    英工党年会第四日
    抨击政府农业政策
    英共加入工党要求竟遭拒绝
    【新华社延安十四日电】据路透社朴茨茅斯讯：十三日工党年会时，第四日的会议上，代表们猛烈反对工党政府目前的农业政策，代表们以绝大多数票通过批评政府农业政策的决议：大会决议：“根据本次会议的意见，政府应更加依照工党已通过的纲领实行农业政策，及更加改善就业条件的时候，已经到了”。据说此举已引起英当局的巨大惊异。会后农林部长，曾与各农业代表举行会议。英政府与工党大会代表的另一争执，为征兵法问题。会议继农业问题后，又通过反对征兵法的决议。但掌玺大臣格林伍德亟力坚持该法，并声言为“实践某些义务”所必须。经过剧烈辩论后，反对该案的决议，现被否决。
    【新华社延安十四日电】在朴茨茅斯（在英南部，前误译布斯圣斯）举行的英工党第四十五届年会，于十二日讨论修改党章问题。会上拥有九十一万会员的机器工会联合会代表提出对修改党章之建议：在共产党承认工党党章的谅解下，接受其加入工党的要求。经激烈的争辩后，据法新闻处讯：终以二、四七三、○○○票，对六六七、○○○票通过该党执行委员会所提议案：修改党章，规定任何单独政治团体，不得被接受参加工党。按工党于一九○八年宣布的纲领中，曾规定任何团体与工人只要承认该党党纲，并缴纳党费，均可加入该党。英国共产党为了统一与团结工人阶级的力量，并推动工党前进，曾十二次要求参加工党。英共这一要求虽获得工党内部许多党员的共鸣，但均遭右派占优势的该党领导机关所拒绝。现工党年会通过修改党章之举，不仅将英共要求参加工党之门关闭，此势将引起英工党内进步势力之反对，使其内部矛盾加剧。
