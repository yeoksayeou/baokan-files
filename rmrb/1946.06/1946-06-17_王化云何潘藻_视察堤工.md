    [Heze, 15th (of this month)] Wang Huayun, Director of the Yellow River Committee of the Jilu Yu Administrative Office, and advisor He Fanzhao, inspected the construction progress at the Third Repair and Defense Office on the 12th, and surveyed the dangerous works in that section. They returned at 6:00 PM that day. The dangerous works surveyed included the Zhonggudui in Yunbei and Yangji in Shouzhang. The dangerous work at Zhonggudui had two weirs, totaling fifteen zhang in length, which had been completely destroyed by the beach and must be repaired, requiring 630,000 catties of straw and 12,000 catties of hemp. This is the smallest dangerous work in that section. According to Wang and He, all 14,000 people in Yunbei County have started work. The Third Repair and Defense Office is expected to commence full-scale construction along the entire line by the 14th, with an estimated 130,000 people participating. The masses involved in dike repair are in high spirits and working with great order. When Wang and He drove to the Panxi Ferry, they encountered 2,000 people from that area marching to work in formation, with over a hundred large and small carts carrying grain, fully demonstrating the organizational capabilities of the liberated area's masses. Upon seeing Wang and He, the masses sent representatives to petition, demanding that the Kuomintang government and UNRRA allocate funds and food for the project and resettlement relief as soon as possible. On the same day, the masses in Puyang County also held a forum, making the same demands to the Repair and Defense Office. However, because only 150 tons of flour have been delivered to date, and no work materials or resettlement funds have been allocated, Wang and He were unable to give a concrete response to the demands of the masses.

    视察堤工
    【本报荷泽十五日电】冀鲁豫行署黄委会主任王化云、顾问何藩藻二氏，于十二日赴第三修防处视察动工情形，并勘察该段险工，当日下午六时返回。该段险工共勘察郓北之钟固堆及寿张之杨集二处，钟固堆之险工有埽二道，共长十五丈已全部滩毁，重新修复须秸料六十三万斤，麻一万二千斤，此为该段最小之险工。据王、何二氏称：郓北县之一万四千群众，已全部动工。第三修防处至十四日即可全线动工，人数预计可达十三万。复堤群众情绪甚高，工作极有秩序。当王、何二氏驱车行至潘溪渡时，适值该区二千人结队上工，并带有载运粮食之大小车百余辆，充分表现了解放区群众的组织性。群众见王、何二氏前来，即推派代表请愿，要求国民党政府及联总行总尽早拨发工款工粮及迁移救济费，同日濮县群众亦召开座谈会，向修防处提出同样要求，唯因面粉迄今仅运来一百五十吨，工物及迁移费则毫未拨发，故王、何二氏未能具体答复群众要求。
