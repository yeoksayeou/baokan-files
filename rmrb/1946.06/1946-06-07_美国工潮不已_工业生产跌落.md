Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: TASS, New York reports: American industrial production in April and early May has declined significantly, mainly due to strikes caused by employers refusing to conclude agreements that satisfy workers' demands. The coal miners' strike has had a particularly large impact on production. According to the New York Times, the production index for the week ending May 20 was 117.7, while the index for the week ending April 20 was 125.9. This index is compiled based on production materials from industries such as railway transportation, steel manufacturing, electricity, paper, and lumber. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's monthly index of industrial production was 161 in April and 164 in May, compared to 229 in April of last year. The decrease in the April index was mainly due to the closure of some coal mines and the shutdown of iron smelting, steel manufacturing, and other industries that rely on coal mines.

    美国工潮不已
    工业生产跌落
    【新华社延安二日电】塔斯社纽约讯：四月份和五月初期的美国工业生产，已显著的跌落，其主要原因，为雇主拒绝订立满足工人要求的协议而招致的罢工所致。煤矿工人罢工，影响生产尤大。据纽约时报所载：五月二十日为止的一周生产指数，为一一七·七，而四月二十日为止的一周则为一二五·九，此项指数系根据铁路运输量、制钢、电力、纸张、木材等业生产材料编制而成。联邦调查局工业生产的每月指数，计四月份为一六一，五月份为一六四，而去年四月为二二九。四月份指数之降低，主要由于若干煤矿关闭，及依赖煤矿的炼铁、制钢等工业之停工。
