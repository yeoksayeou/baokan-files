Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th. A telegram urgently sent from Beiping on the 29th: The CCP news organs, Liberation Daily and Xinhua Branch Office, were illegally closed by the Kuomintang authorities at 8 p.m. on the 29th. Chen Zhuo, the director of the Beiping Municipal Police Bureau, stated in the order to cease publication that this action was taken on the basis of a "central telegram." The Liberation Daily and the Beiping Branch of Xinhua News Agency were published on February 22nd of this year. The Liberation Daily stated in its inaugural statement that its purpose was "to strive for peaceful, democratic, and united construction." Since its publication, it has been welcomed by all sectors of society, with a circulation of 50,000 copies, breaking the record for the highest circulation of newspapers in Beiping and Tianjin. However, it has been hated by the Kuomintang fascist faction. Starting with the second issue, incidents of news vendors being beaten and newspapers being torn up occurred constantly. Before dawn on April 3rd, the Beiping authorities sent a large number of military police and secret agents to illegally arrest more than 30 people, including Qian Junrui, the director of the two agencies. They were detained for 29 hours. After protests from all walks of life, the authorities, knowing they were in the wrong, released them. Police Chief Chen Zhuo apologized to the arrested in person. Unexpectedly, only a little over a month later, the Liberation Daily and Xinhua Branch Office were closed without any reason under the instruction of the Nanjing Kuomintang authorities. This illegal action by the reactionaries within the Kuomintang is not only an unreasonable attack on the national press, but also a step in the conspiracy to expand the civil war.

This newspaper's Handan dispatch, 31st. The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Journalists Association and the People's Daily, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu General Branch of Xinhua News Agency, the People's Army News, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Writers Association, the Northern Magazine, the Literary and Art Magazine, the People's Pictorial, the Taihang, Taiyue, Ji-Lu-Yu, and Ji'nan newspapers and news agencies, the Xinhua Bookstore, and the Taofen Bookstore here, have learned that the Beiping Liberation Daily and Xinhua News Agency were illegally closed by the Kuomintang on the 29th, and express unlimited indignation. We hereby send a telegram to the national press, protesting against the Kuomintang's perverse actions, calling on the national press to pay attention to this reactionary measure of the Kuomintang with a hundredfold vigilance, and pointing out that this incident is another signal of the Chinese fascists' new offensive against the Chinese people. The people of the whole country, the press of the whole country, must mobilize together to smash this conspiracy of the Kuomintang, put down the ferocity of the Chinese fascist faction, and fight to the end to defend democracy, defend peace, defend freedom of speech and publication, and defend the mouthpiece of the people of the North, the Liberation Daily and the Xinhua Branch Office. We demand that the Kuomintang authorities immediately restore the freedom of publication and distribution of the Beiping Liberation Daily and Xinhua News Agency, compensate for the losses caused by the suspension of publication, stop the destruction and oppression of news and cultural undertakings by secret agents throughout the country, and fulfill the four promises. The telegram finally warned the Chinese fascist elements: The oppression you inflict on the Chinese people cannot stop the Chinese people from advancing, and the beacon of peace and democracy—the Beiping Liberation Daily and Xinhua Branch Office—will forever illuminate the North.

    国民党当局阴谋扩大内战
    竟非法封闭北平解放报暨新华分社
    我边区新闻文化界通电抗议国民党之倒行逆施
    要求立即恢复北平解放报新华社出版发行自由
    【新华社延安三十日电】北平二十九日夜急电：中共新闻机关解放报与新华分社，已于二十九日下午八时被国民党当局非法关闭。平市警察局长陈焯所发表之勒令停刊令中声称：此举系奉“中央电令”。按解放报与新华社北平分社，系于本年二月二十二日发行，解放报在发刊询中声明：“以努力和平民主团结建设”为宗旨，出版以来，深得社会各界欢迎，销数达五万份，打破平津报纸发行额的最高纪录，但却遭国民党法西斯派的痛恨，第二期起即不断发生报贩被殴，报纸被撕毁事件。四月三日黎明前，北平当局曾派大批军警特务，将该两社社长钱俊瑞以下三十余人非法拘捕，被扣押达二十九小时，经各界抗议，当局自知理屈，始予释放。警察局长陈焯曾当面向被捕者道歉。不意事隔仅月余，终又毫无理由的在南京国民党当局的指令下，将解放报与新华分社封闭。国民党内反动派此种非法行动，不仅是对全国言论界的无理进攻，而且也是扩大内战的阴谋的步骤。
    【本报邯郸三十一日电】此间晋冀鲁豫边区新闻界联合会暨人民日报，新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社，人民的军队报，晋冀鲁豫边区文联，文协会，北方杂志社，文艺杂志社，人民画报社，太行、太岳、冀鲁豫、冀南各报纸通讯社，新华书店，韬奋书店，闻悉北平解放报、新华社于二十九日被国民党非法封闭，咸表无限愤慨。特致电全国言论界，抗议国民党此种倒行逆施，呼吁全国言论界以百倍的警惕，注视国民党此一反动措施，指出这一事件是中国法西斯向中国人民新进攻的又一个信号。全国人民，全国言论界、须要一致动员起来，粉碎国民党此种阴谋，把中国法西斯派的凶焰打下去，为保卫民主，保卫和平，保卫言论出版自由，保卫北方人民喉舌解放日报和新华分社而战斗到底。要求国民党当局立即恢复北平解放报新华社的出版发行自由，赔偿停刊所造成的损失，停止全国各地特务对新闻文化事业的摧毁与压迫，实践四项诺言。该电最后警告中国法西斯分子说：你们给予中国人民的压迫，是阻止不了中国人民的前进的，和平民主的灯塔——北平的解放报与新华分社将永远照耀着北方。
