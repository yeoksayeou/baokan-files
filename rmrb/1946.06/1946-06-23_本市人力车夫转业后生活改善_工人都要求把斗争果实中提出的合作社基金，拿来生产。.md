　　Post-Turnover Life Improvement of Rickshaw Pullers in This City
    Workers Demand Cooperative Funds from the Fruits of Struggle be Used for Production.
    [This City News] During the enemy and puppet regime's rule, there were more than 230 rickshaw pullers in this city, living in hunger and cold (sorghum and soybean cakes were their regular food). They were also constantly subjected to unreasonable oppression, sometimes not being paid for rides and even being beaten. In addition, they were subject to official errands, and their hard-earned income was not enough to support their families, so they lived in misery all day long. After we liberated Handan, we mobilized the workers, and the rickshaws were changed to trolley-cars. The rickshaw pullers immediately organized a trolley-car workers' union, transporting goods and equipment. Now, each person can earn up to 1,500 yuan per day, with an average of 300 to 500 yuan per person per day, enough to buy more than 10 jin of millet. A family of five can live without worry.
    In order to improve the lives of the workers, the democratic government provided them with a large number of low-interest loans to develop production and establish households. Meng Jifang, the leader of the third group of the trolley-car workers' union, led his group to use the loans as a fund for mutual aid production. Seven people borrowed 70,000 yuan, and for the first time, they sold 18 pigs in Daming, earning 3,000 yuan per share after expenses. The second time, each share earned another 5,500 yuan in foreign currency. Meng Jifang said, "We plan to earn enough to repay the government's loans, use our own money as capital, and then develop production."
    Union members are very eager to start production, but the cooperative fund (with worker shares) extracted from the fruits of struggle has not yet been used for production. Workers are demanding that this issue be resolved quickly.

　　本市人力车夫转业后生活改善
    工人都要求把斗争果实中提出的合作社基金，拿来生产。
    【本市讯】敌伪统治时，本市有人力车夫二百三十余名，他们过着饥寒交迫的生活（高粱、豆饼之类是他们经常的食品）。还不断遭受无理的欺压，有时坐车不给钱还要受打骂，加上支官出差，劳苦所得不够养家糊口，终日生活在困苦中。我解放邯郸后，发动工人，黄包车改为排车，车夫们立即组织起排车工会，运输货物器材。现在每人每天最高能赚一五○○元，平均每人每日能赚三○○元——五○○元，可买小米一○斤以上。五口之家的生活可以无忧。
    民主政府为了改善工人生活，曾以大批低利贷款给他们发展生产，建立家务。排车工会第三组组长孟季方领导该组，以贷款为基金互助生产，七个人贷款七万元，第一次到大名卖猪十八只，除花消外，每股批红三千元。第二次每股又赚洋五千五百元。孟季方说：“咱准备赚了还政府的贷款，用咱自己的钱作本，再发展生产。”
    工会会员要求生产的都很迫切，但由于从斗争果实中提出之合作社基金（有工人股份），至今未能拿出来用于生产，这一问题，工人都要求赶快解决。
