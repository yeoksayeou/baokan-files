Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 2nd: Washington dispatch: Labor strikes in the United States subside in one wave, only to rise again in another. According to a United Press report: After ending the strike of 400,000 bituminous coal miners, the United Mine Workers of America launched a strike of 76,000 anthracite coal miners on May 31st, demanding that mine owners increase wages and establish health and welfare funds. Representatives of the United Mine Workers of America declared that all anthracite coal mines in Pennsylvania had completely shut down on the 1st. Another report states that the National Maritime Union has initiated a major maritime strike, scheduled to begin on the 15th. It is claimed that this strike will completely paralyze the merchant fleet and halt shipping in ports on both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. It is reported that six other unions have joined the National Maritime Union, demanding a 40% wage increase and an eight-hour workday. The aforementioned seven unions have 200,000 members and manage 3,100 ships.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 2nd: Washington dispatch: The labor strike of 400,000 bituminous coal miners in the United States has been resolved. John L. Lewis, President of the Coal Miners Union, ordered a resumption of work on the 3rd. Interior Secretary Krug and Lewis signed a contract at the White House on May 29th, stipulating: (1) Basic wages will be increased by 18.5 cents per hour, effective May 25th. (2) The workday is nine hours, and overtime will be paid for work exceeding nine hours. (3) Five cents per ton of coal will be allocated to the workers' retirement and welfare fund. (4) Workers are entitled to one week of paid vacation per year.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 1st: Washington dispatch: On May 30th, the US Senate continued to debate the strike conscription bill originally proposed by Truman, which stipulates the forced conscription of striking workers in industries taken over by the government. Although the bill passed the House of Representatives, it met with opposition from a majority of senators in the Senate. According to a United Press report, this most severe anti-strike bill since Roosevelt's New Deal has not only aroused opposition from organized labor but also from conservatives in the Democratic and Republican parties. Some Republican conservatives in the Senate have sided with New Deal Democrats. Of the 44 senators who opposed the strike conscription bill, nine were Democrats, twenty-four were Republicans, and one was a Progressive. Truman's anti-strike bills presented to the US Congress this time include two types: one was a request to Congress on May 25th to enact legislation restricting strikes, the contents of which are: (1) Prohibit any union leader from encouraging or inciting workers to strike; (2) Workers who unjustifiably persist in striking should be deprived of their priority employment rights; (3) Employers and union leaders who violate the provisions of the bill should be subject to criminal penalties. This bill has already passed both the House and Senate. The other is the strike conscription bill.

    美国工潮彼伏此起
    八万无烟煤工又停工
    参院反对杜鲁门罢工征兵法案
    【新华社延安二日电】华盛顿讯：美工潮一波方平，一波又起。据合众社讯：美联合矿工职工会，在结束四十万烟煤矿工的罢工后，上月三十一日又发动七万六千名无烟煤采掘工人实行罢工，要求矿主增加工资，及设置保健与福利基金。联合会矿工会代表宣称：宾夕法尼亚所有无烟煤矿工，已于一日完全停工。又讯：全国海员工会发起的海员大罢工，决于十五日举行。据称：这一罢工将使商船队完全陷于麻痹，使太平洋及大西洋两岸各港之航运停顿。据称：另有其他六个职工会，已参加全国海员工会。要求增资百分之四十，及八小时工作制。上述七个职工会拥有二十万会员，管理轮船三千一百艘。
    【新华社延安二日电】华盛顿讯：美四十万烟煤工人工潮已解决。煤矿工会主席路易斯，下令于三日复工。内长克鲁格与路易斯上月二十九日已在白宫签订合同，规定：（一）自上月二十五日起，每小时基本工资增加一角八分五。（二）每日工作九小时，九小时以外之工作得另加工资。（三）规定从每吨煤中抽出美金五分作为工人的退休与福利金。（四）每年特许工人休假一星期。
    【新华社延安一日电】华盛顿讯：上月三十日美参院继续争辩原杜鲁门所提的罢工征兵法案，其内容规定将政府接收的工业中罢工工人强征入伍。该法案虽经众院通过，但在参院中却遭到多数参议员的反对，据合众社讯：此自罗斯福新政以来最严酷之反罢工法案，不仅引起有组织劳工之反对，且引起民主党与共和党中保守分子之反对，参院中有若干共和党保守分子已与民主党的新政分子站在一起。在反对此项罢工征兵法案的四十四名参议员中，据九名为民主党，二十四名为共和党，一名为进步党，按杜鲁门此次在美国会中所提出之反罢工法案计有两种：一为上月二十五日要求国会制定限制罢工法，其内容为：（１）禁止任何职工会领袖鼓励或煽动工人罢工；（２）对无故坚持罢工之工人，应褫夺其尽先任职权；（３）对违反法案规定的雇主与职工会领袖，予以刑事处分。该法案已经参众两院通过。另一即为罢工征兵法案。
