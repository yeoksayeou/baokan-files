　　Xinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 1st: The large-scale military action of the Kuomintang army attacking the Eastern Hebei Liberated Area has already begun. On May 29th, the Kuomintang army concentrated two divisions to launch an offensive from the east and west towards the Xianghe, Baodi, and Ninghe line, attempting to capture the above-mentioned areas, open up the highway traffic line from Beiping via Tongxian to the Beining Railway, cut off the Eastern Hebei Liberated Area, and then attack the Yutian and Sanhe line to the north. At 17:00 on May 25th, two regiments of the Kuomintang army originally stationed in Tongxian were increased to Matou Town, and on the 30th they began attacking Xianghe. Their advance troops had reached Zhangjiawu, more than ten miles southeast of the town, and engaged in fierce fighting with the Eighth Route Army and local people's guerrillas stationed there. On the same day, a battalion of the 76th Division of the Kuomintang army in Miyun, together with a part of the puppet army, totaling more than 600 people, occupied Shawo (more than 30 miles southeast of Miyun) in the morning, appearing to continue advancing southward. Peng Decai's 167th Regiment of the 92nd Army of the Kuomintang in Huairou, northern Hebei, has been shelling the Qiaozicun area of the Liberated Area for days since the 23rd of last month. The Kuomintang army stationed in Lutai on the Beining Railway is recruiting a large number of soldiers in order to expand its civil war strength, and is continuously transporting large quantities of weapons from Tianjin. In order to coordinate with the ground offensive, Kuomintang aircraft have been reconnoitering Xianghe, Sanhe, and Ninghe for days.
　　The military commander and organizer of this attack on Eastern Hebei is Li Wen, commander-in-chief of the 34th Army Group of the Kuomintang, whose headquarters is located in Beiping, where the Military Mediation Executive Department is located. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek, after deploying the civil war in the Northeast, also rushed to Beiping on the 30th to personally summon the generals and deploy the civil war in North China. They disregarded the peace efforts of the Military Mediation Department nearby and the peace demands of the vast number of people, and continued to go their own way, expanding the civil war, which has made the situation in Hebei even more tense. The Eighth Route Army in Eastern Hebei has decided to take a firm self-defense stance and will strike at the invaders.

    蒋介石布置华北内战
    开始进攻我冀东区
    我军决予进犯者以打击
    【新华社遵化一日急电】国民党进攻冀东解放区之大规模军事行动，业已开始。五月二十九日，国民党军集中两个师兵力，开始自东西两面，向香河、宝坻、宁河一线进攻，企图攻占上述各地，打通北平经通县而达北宁路之公路交通线，割裂冀东解放区，然后再北向进攻玉田、三河一线。五月二十五日十七时，原驻通县国民党军两个团增至码头镇，卅日即开始向香河进攻，其先头部队已到达该镇东南十余里之张家务前，与驻防该地之八路军及当地人民游击队发生激战，同日密云国民党军七十六师一营，配合伪军一部，共六百余人，于是日晨进占沙窝（密云东南卅余里），有向南继续进犯模样。平北怀柔之国民党九十二军所属一六七团彭德材部，自上月二十三日以来，连日炮轰解放区之桥梓村一带，驻北宁路芦台之国民党军，为扩充内战实力，正大量招兵，并从天津源源运来大量武器。为配合地面进攻，国民党飞机连日侦察香河、三河、宁河各地。
    此次进攻冀东之军事指挥者与组织者，为国民党第卅四集团军总司令李文，其司令部设于军事调处执行部所在地北平。同时，蒋介石于布置东北内战后亦于三十日匆忙飞抵北平，亲自召集各将领，布置华北内战，彼等不顾近在咫尺的军调部的和平努力，与广大人民的和平要求，而继续一意孤行，扩大内战，已使河北形势更加紧张。冀东八路军已决定采取坚决的自卫立场，将予进犯者以打击。
