Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 12th: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 11th, Deng Yingchao, the representative from the Liberated Areas to the World Federation of Democratic Women, has cabled the World Federation of Democratic Women in Paris, requesting "instructions and assistance." This is because she has been unable to obtain a passport and permission from the government to attend the Executive Committee meeting of the Women's International Democratic Federation from June 27th to 29th. Deng is a women's leader elected from the Communist areas, and one of the eight Chinese members of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Democratic Women. She declared to the world that efforts to request a passport from the government have been in vain. It is said that government officials told her that she must obtain the consent of the Executive Yuan and national women's groups before she can go to Paris. The other two Communist women representatives are the famous writer Ding Ling and Cai Chang, a member of the Yan'an Communist Executive Committee. The other representatives are all designated by the government and are already women abroad.
