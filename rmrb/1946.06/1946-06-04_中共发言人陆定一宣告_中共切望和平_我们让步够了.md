Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st. United Press, Nanjing, 31st: CCP spokesman Lu Dingyi declared: The CCP ardently desires peace, but will no longer make any concessions, and warned that the Northeast crisis is very serious. Lu said: "We have made enough concessions," and said that just as Marshall's unity committee was about to achieve concrete results, the Kuomintang army continued to advance after the CCP voluntarily gave up Changchun, which has dimmed the hope of peace. He said: The Communist Party withdrew from Changchun in order to reopen peace talks, but the only answer from the government was to put forward new conditions and make further military advances.

    【新华社延安一日电】美联社南京三十一日讯：中共发言人陆定一宣告：中共切望和平，但将不再作任何让步，并提出警告东北危机非常严重。陆氏说：“我们让步让够了”，并说马歇尔的团结委员会，正快要获得具体结果的时候，国民党军却在中共自动让出长春后，继续前进，已使和平的希望趋于暗淡。他说：共产党退出长春，是为了让和平谈判重开，但政府方面唯一的回答，却是提出新的条件，并在军事上作进一步的前进。
