Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd: The Chinese Communist Party's Political Consultative Conference (PCC) representatives sent a letter to the Kuomintang PCC representatives yesterday (the 21st), proposing four suggestions for a long-term ceasefire in the Northeast. The original letter is as follows:

To Mr. Zhesheng, Mr. Tiecheng, Mr. Xueting, Mr. Lizi, Mr. Lifu, Mr. Lisheng, and please forward to Chairman Chiang:

Since the ceasefire in the Northeast, the people of the whole country and the public opinion of the world have been eager for the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to reach a unanimous agreement on the three issues of transportation, ceasefire, and troop reorganization in the Northeast within these fifteen days, thanks to the joint efforts of Marshall, so that the temporary truce can become a long-term truce, to reopen the door to peace. Unfortunately, after fifteen days of efforts by all parties, the troop reorganization plan proposed by the government was completely unexpected, intending to remove the Communist troops from major cities and railways during the reorganization period in order to eliminate them, and insisting on the final decision-making power of the American representative in the three-party agreement to guarantee the implementation of the plan. In this situation, we have no way to consider it. The situation is urgent, and the flames of civil war are about to break out and become uncontrollable. At this critical moment, if the civil war is not stopped immediately, the people will suffer, the country will be devastated, and the bleak future is truly unimaginable. We have just received instructions from our Party Central Committee, based on the current domestic and international situation and the will of the people of the whole country, that only a swift ceasefire and the realization of peace can save the current serious crisis and rescue our compatriots from suffering. To this end, we hereby formally propose to your side to implement the following steps:

(1) The Three-Person Committee should immediately announce a long-term ceasefire in the Northeast, and reiterate the national ceasefire order, stipulating specific measures to stop all military conflicts, and ordering both sides' troops to strictly abide by them. (2) After the ceasefire order is issued, the Three-Person Committee should immediately negotiate specific measures to restore national transportation, and first repair important railways. (3) The Three-Person Committee should regularly negotiate specific supplementary measures for the reorganization and demobilization of troops nationwide and in the Northeast, and immediately implement them. (4) The government should, through consultation, periodically reopen the Political Consultative Conference, and quickly resolve the reorganization of the government, guarantee human rights, relieve people's livelihood, complete unification, and various political issues.

If you agree with the above four items, please submit them separately to the Three-Person Committee and the PCC Comprehensive Group for agreement and implementation, in order to reassure the people and meet the expectations of the public. The situation is critical and urgent. This is a special suggestion, and we are extremely eager to await your instructions. We also wish you peace!

Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Ye Jianying, Wu Yuzhang, Lu Dingyi, Deng Yingchao, Li Weihan, respectfully.

June 21, 35th year of the Republic of China

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: According to a Nanjing dispatch: Under the tremendous pressure of the people of the whole country resolutely opposing the civil war and demanding peace, Chiang Kai-shek announced on the 21st that the ceasefire order in the Northeast would be extended to noon on the 30th. (Note: The Northeast ceasefire order announced by Chiang on the 6th of this month had a deadline from noon on the 7th to noon on the 22nd.) The CCP has issued an order to the troops in the Northeast on the 21st to continue to implement the ceasefire.

　　中共代表向蒋及政府代表建议
    仍主宣布东北长期停战
    重申全国停战令迅速解决改组政府等问题
    蒋被迫宣布将东北停战令延期八天
    【新华社南京二十二日电】中国共产党政协代表于昨（二十一）日致函国民党政协代表，提出东北长期停战四项建议，原函如下：
    哲生、铁城、雪艇、力子、立夫、厉生六先生并请转陈蒋主席勋鉴：
    自东北停战以来，全国人民，举世舆论，莫不渴望国共双方在此十五日中，能由于马歇尔之共同努力，获得关于交通、停战及东北整军三项问题之一致协议，使暂时休战成长期停战，以重开和平之门。不幸经十五天各方面之奔走努力，政府方面所提整军方案，竟完全出乎意外，以图将中共部队，在整军期间排出大城市及铁路线，以便消灭，坚持美方代表在三方面协议中之最后决定权，保证方案之实施。似此情况，敝方实无从考虑。事日亟，内战大火有一发难收之势。值此紧急之时，再不立即停止内战，则人民涂炭，国家糜烂，惨淡前途，诚不堪设想。顷接敝党中央训令，根据目前内外情况，全国人民意志，认为非迅速停战实现和平，不足以挽救当前之严重危机，出同胞于水火。为此，特向贵方正式提议，实行如下步骤：
    （一）由三人会议立即宣布东北长期停战，并重申全国停战命令，规定停止一切军事冲突之具体办法，命令双方部队严格遵守。（二）停战令下后，由三人会议立即协商恢复全国交通之具体办法，并首先修复重要铁路。（三）由三人会议定期商定全国及东北整军复员之具体补充办法，并立即付诸实施。（四）由政府经协商定期重开政治协商会议，迅速解决改组政府、保障人权、解救民生、完成统一，及各项政治问题。
    上述四项如荷赞同，请即分别提交三人会议及政协综合小组协议实施，以安人心，以符众望。时危事急，特此建议，不胜迫切待命之至。并颂公安！
    周恩来、董必武、叶剑英、吴玉章、陆定一、邓颖超、李维汉谨启。
    三十五年六月二十一日
    【新华社延安二十二日电】据南京讯：在全国人民坚决反对内战，要求和平的巨大压力下，蒋介石于二十一日宣布，将东北之停战令延期至三十日中午。（按本月六日蒋宣布的东北停战令，其期限为七日中午至二十二日中午。）中共方面已于二十一日通令东北方面部队，继续实行停战。
