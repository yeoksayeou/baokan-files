    Overcoming Heavy Obstacles from the Kuomintang
    Wounded and Sick Soldiers of the Central Plains Military Region Arrive in Handan
    Liberated Area People Give a Warm Welcome
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper]: More than 740 wounded and sick soldiers and family members of the 5th Division of the New Fourth Army of the Central Plains Military Region have been transferred via the Pinghan Railway and have safely arrived in Handan. They were repeatedly subjected to illegal obstruction by the Kuomintang along the way. According to the agreement between the two sides, the original plan was to transport 1,200 people, but when boarding the train at Guangshui Station, the Kuomintang illegally obstructed and detained more than 500 people. On the 18th of last month, they got off the train in Anyang and arrived in the liberated area. The masses in the liberated area warmly welcomed them along the way and took great care of them. When passing through Heqing Village in Anyang, it was late at night, and the masses lined the road with lights to welcome them for four miles. People from all directions rushed to transport them with stretchers and carts, and representatives were sent to express their condolences for three consecutive days. On the 18th, they arrived at Guantai Town, and the local primary schools, businesses, and people voluntarily vacated rooms for the wounded and sick soldiers to stay. Students in the town organized a comfort team to serve food, water, read newspapers, and write letters home. On the 19th, all sectors of the town held a welcoming party. At the meeting, Comrade Chen, a representative of the New Fourth Army women, said: "After arriving in the liberated area, we were very excited by the enthusiastic concern and care shown to us by the masses along the way, but when we think of the many wounded and sick soldiers in the Central Plains who are surrounded and blockaded by the reactionaries in the Kuomintang area and enduring all kinds of difficulties, we feel very sad in our happiness.” On the morning of the 20th, the first group of wounded and sick soldiers left Guantai to recuperate in the hospital. As of June 3, all the wounded and sick soldiers have been dispatched to their respective recuperation locations.
