    [Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 18th] After the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Tianjin, in conjunction with the puppet troops along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, wantonly destroyed the Wen'anwa sluice gate in the Liberated Area, more than 300 villages, thousands of acres of fertile land, and a population of more than 110,000 in the area are facing the disaster of flooding. For this reason, the CCP representative stationed at the Botou Executive Group lodged a serious protest with the government representative, Mi Luohan, demanding that the government side immediately repair the sluice gate and compensate the people for their losses.
