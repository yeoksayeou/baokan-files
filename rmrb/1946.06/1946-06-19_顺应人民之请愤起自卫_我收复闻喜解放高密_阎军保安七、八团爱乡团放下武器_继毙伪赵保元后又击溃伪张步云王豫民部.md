    [From Our Frontline Dispatch] Wenxi City, an important town on the Tongpu Railway, was once again recovered by our Taiyue Eighth Route Army on the 15th of this month at 19:00. The city was liberated from the enemy and puppets by our army on December 8th of last year, and was occupied by Yan Xishan's troops in mid-December. For half a year, Yan's troops stationed in the city used it as an anti-communist stronghold, frantically attacking our liberated areas, and recently they have intensified their efforts. On the 12th of this month, our Taiyue Eighth Route Army, at the request of the people of Wenxi County, rose up in self-defense. By 18:00 on the 14th, the entire Yan's army, the 7th and 8th Security Regiments and the Local Defense Corps, laid down their weapons, and Wenxi was once again recovered by us. The people of the entire city warmly welcomed their liberators into the city.

    [Our Yangcheng Dispatch, 17th] After the ceasefire order, Yan's troops in Wenxi City, disregarding our army's firm sincerity for a ceasefire and our friendly assistance in purchasing grain, repaid kindness with enmity, and continued to attack our liberated areas. Up to the end of May, attacks involving more than 100 people occurred 17 times, and the constant harassment and sneak attacks were countless. Due to the attacks by Yan's troops, our Wenxi Eighth Route Army suffered the sacrifice of 31 soldiers below the rank of platoon leader, and 59 people below the rank of regiment commander. The losses suffered by the injured masses were even greater. Since June, in order to cooperate with Chiang's army in its full-scale offensive against our Fen-nan and Tongpu railway line areas, the Yan's army has also launched fierce attacks on our troops stationed outside the city with forces ranging from 100 to 500 people for several consecutive days, and has sent a large number of armed special agents to penetrate into our Yi Zhang, Guan Zhuang, Qiu Cun, Yao Zhang, Xia Kang and other villages to hunt down and kill mass cadres, and loot clothing and grain. One hundred and twenty mu of wheat belonging to the masses outside the city was reaped by Yan's troops, and eight farmers who were cutting wheat were killed, twenty-five were wounded, and sixteen were taken away. Thirteen of our sentries stationed were murdered. Therefore, the masses inside and outside the city were filled with resentment towards Yan's troops for this kind of atrocity, and demanded that our army rescue them. Although our army repeatedly protested to the executive group, Yan's troops still did not stop attacking us, and strictly monitored Comrade Zhao Jingqi, the leader of our liaison group stationed in the city, threatening him in every possible way, and constantly sending special agents to throw bricks and tiles into the courtyard of our liaison group leader and fire cold shots. We could no longer stay and work.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 16th] After liberating Jiaoxian and other places on the 9th, the Jiaodong Eighth Route Army liberated Gaomi City, which had been occupied by puppet troops, at 11:00 a.m. on the 13th. Zhang Buyun, a major traitor who had harmed the people of Gaomi and Zhucheng for many years, of the puppet Yudong Peace and National Construction Army, and Wang Yumin's troops of the puppet Shandong National Self-Defense Army, have been defeated, and the results of the battle are being investigated. Lieutenant Colonel Moore, the U.S. representative for the Gaomi team stationed in the church next to the East Gate Railway Station, and Mr. Ha Huiqi, the Shandong inspection commissioner of UNRRA who recently arrived in Gaomi, are extremely safe under the protection of our army and have established close contact with our army.

    顺应人民之请愤起自卫
    我收复闻喜解放高密
    阎军保安七、八团爱乡团放下武器
    继毙伪赵保元后又击溃伪张步云王豫民部
    【本报前方专电】同蒲重镇之闻喜城，已于本月十五日十九时，再度为我太岳八路军收复。该城于去年十二月八日，即为我军从敌伪手中所解放，十二月中旬，始被阎锡山军所侵占。半年来盘据城内之阎军，遂依此作为反共据点，疯狂向我解放区进犯，近来更变本加厉。本月十二日，我太岳八路军，应闻喜全县人民之请，乃愤起自卫，至十四日十八时，城内阎军保七团、保八团以及爱乡团，全部放下武器，闻喜遂再度为我收复。全城人民，均热烈欢迎自己的解放者入城。
    【本报阳城十七日电】停战令后，闻喜城内阎军，不顾我军坚决停战诚意，与帮助购粮等友谊，反以怨报德，不断向我解放区进攻。截自五月底止，百人以上之进攻即达十七次，经常性之骚扰偷袭，则无法统计。我闻喜八路军因阎军进攻共牺牲排长以下三十一人，团长以下五十九人，负伤群众损失更重。六月以来，该部为配合蒋军向我汾南、同蒲沿线全面进攻，亦连日以百人至五百人兵力向我城外驻军猛烈进犯，并派出大批武装特务，深入我仪张、官庄、邱村、姚幛、下康等村捕杀群众干部，抢劫衣物粮食。城外群众小麦一百二十亩，即被阎军抢割而去，并打死割麦农民八人，打伤二十五人，抓走十六人，我驻军哨兵被暗害十三名。因此，城内外群众，对阎军此种暴行，均愤恨万分，纷纷要求我军解救。我军虽向执行组一再提出抗议，但阎军仍未停止向我进攻，并将我驻城内之连络组长赵敬齐同志严加监视，百般威胁，经常派遣特务向我连络组长院内投掷砖瓦，发射冷枪，我无法继续驻留与工作。
    【新华社莱阳十六日电】胶东八路军继九日解放胶县等地，击毙伪军头子赵保元以后，复剩胜于十三日上午十一时解放由伪军盘据的高密城。残害高密、诸城一带人民多年的大汉奸伪豫东和平建国军张步云，及伪山东国民自卫军王豫民部，已被击溃，战果正清查中。驻该城东关车站旁教堂之高密小组美方代理代表莫尔中校，及最近抵高之联总山东视察专员哈惠琪氏，在我军保护下，均极安全，并已与我军取得密切联络。
