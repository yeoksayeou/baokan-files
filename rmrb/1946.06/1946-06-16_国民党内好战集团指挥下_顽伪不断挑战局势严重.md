Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 13th: Under the command of the belligerent clique within the Kuomintang, the Kuomintang, together with puppet troops in various regions, disregarding repeated ceasefire agreements and the peace efforts of the Executive Headquarters, are making endless challenges to the Liberated Areas, which has made the situation in China very serious. Recent important developments are as follows:

(1) Northeast China: After the 15-day ceasefire order in Northeast China took effect, the Kuomintang army commanded by Du Yuming continued to attack the Northeast Democratic Allied Army in areas such as Lafa, Haicheng, Benxi, and Faku. Starting in the afternoon of the 7th, the Kuomintang army in Yongji and Lafa attacked the county seat of Jiaohe, southeast of Lafa. They also fiercely bombed Jiaohe, Dunhua, and other places with airplanes. In the afternoon of the 7th, a unit of the New 38th Division of the New First Army in Haicheng launched an attack on the Democratic Allied Army's position southeast of Haicheng. After fierce fighting, they occupied Tangwang Mountain, Luojiabuzi, and other places, and continued to attack Ximucheng, a military stronghold 20 kilometers southeast of Haicheng. The 182nd Division of the 60th Army of the Kuomintang in Anshan, north of Haicheng, also launched an attack on Baiwuzhai, 10 kilometers southeast of Anshan, and Xiaonvzhai to its south at the same time. The original troops of the 52nd Army of the Kuomintang in Benxi, after 12:00 on the 10th, also launched fierce artillery attacks on nearby positions of the Democratic Allied Army from Langzishan, 45 kilometers southwest of Benxi, and Qiaotou, 15 kilometers south of Benxi. At 8:00 a.m. on the 8th, two regiments of the Kuomintang army in Dingjiafangshen, 25 kilometers southwest of Faku, launched a fierce attack on Faku. After four hours of fierce fighting, they advanced to the line of Da Xiaofangshen, 15 kilometers southwest of Faku, and their advance units continued to advance to the vicinity of Sitaizi, more than ten li southwest of Faku. A unit of the Kuomintang army in Tieling, 40 kilometers southeast of Faku, also launched an attack on Faku at the same time, and after fierce fighting, occupied Zhenxibao, 30 kilometers southeast of Faku. The battles on the above lines are currently continuing.

(2) Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong: The Kuomintang army once raided and occupied several counties on April 27th. On May 10th, they once raided and occupied Xiayi. Afterwards, starting on May 11th, they assembled the 77th Division of the 73rd Army, the 138th Division of the 48th Army, the 171st and 172nd Divisions of the 7th Army, and the Independent Second and Third Security Regiments of the Eighth Administrative Region of Anhui, and launched a large-scale attack on the Fourth Sub-district of the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region (the area west of the Jinpu Railway and east of the Huainan Railway in Anhui). After invading and occupying Dingyuan County, the center of the area, on the 13th, they continued to carry out so-called comprehensive "suppression" in the entire area, occupying more than 40 important towns such as Outangzhen, and repeatedly refused to allow the Executive Group to mediate. While the war in the Fourth Sub-district of Jiangsu and Anhui was still going on, the 77th Division of the 73rd Army and the 58th Division of the 74th Army launched a large-scale attack on the Third Sub-district of Jiangsu and Anhui (east of the Jinpu Railway, west of the Grand Canal, and south of the Huai River) at 9:00 a.m. on the 7th of this month. On the afternoon of the 7th, they captured the county seat of Lai'an. On the 9th, they added the 172nd Division and the 108th Division of the 25th Army, totaling four divisions, and launched fierce attacks on the sub-district in four places: Liuhe, Yizheng, Lai'an, and Mingguang. They have already occupied Yongjiaji, Xinhuanggang, Yuetangji, and other places. The war is fierce. In addition, the 49th Army of the Kuomintang in Nantong and the 19th Division of the 100th Army of the Kuomintang in Taixing have also been actively attacking since the 29th of last month, and have successively invaded and occupied more than ten important villages and towns such as Xiaohaizhen, Xingrenzhen, Qinzhao, Chenjiaqiao, Dapiegang, Xinba, Jiuhuashan, Dingrunde, Zhenchangzhen (now recovered), Xinzhenshi, Pilushi, Huaqiao, Xuanjiabao (now recovered), and Dasizhuang (now recovered). Currently, the southern line of the Jiangsu-Anhui border region, starting from Dingyuan, Chuxian, Lai'an, Liuhe, and Yizheng in the west, and extending to Yangzhou, Taizhou, Taixing, Jingjiang, Nantong, and Haimen in the east, has all been engulfed in war, and the situation is extremely tense. On the northern line, in the Xuzhou area, three regiments of the 183rd Division of the 58th Army of the Kuomintang also launched a fierce attack on the Liberated Areas of Xiaoxian and Tongshan on the 6th, and have invaded and occupied Shixiangji, Yangzhuang, Yiqiao, Jialou, Pantang, and Linchi. Although it has been decided to immediately disband the puppet troops of Wang Jimei in Zaozhuang, Ning Chunlin in Dawenkou and Tai'an, Zhao Baoyuan in Jiaoxian, Zhang Jingyue in Zhangdian and Zhoucun, and Yang Yuxun in Dexian, etc. in Shandong, through the Summary of the Kuomintang-Communist Talks, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and the troop reorganization plan, the Kuomintang is still colluding with them and instructing them to constantly attack the Liberated Areas and massacre the soldiers and civilians in the Liberated Areas. The puppet troops in Zaozhuang even violently beat Gan Chongdou, a translator, and Wu Wuhan, a telegraph operator, of the CCP representative of the Executive Group on May 21, leaving them on the verge of death. The Kuomintang has ignored the CCP's request to disband these puppet troops.

(3) Henan, Shanxi, and Hebei: The Yudong Liberated Area, south of the Longhai Railway and east of the new Yellow River in Henan, including Suixian, Qixian, Taikang, and Chenliu, has been besieged by the 81st Division of the 68th Army, the 181st Division of the 55th Army, the puppet army of Zhang Lanfeng, and more than 20,000 local security teams since May 11th. After invading and occupying dozens of towns such as Huzhuang, Zhuanlou, Changgang, and Longqu in the area, the Kuomintang army continued to repeatedly "suppress" the entire area, repeatedly killing cadres of the democratic government and peaceful residents, and has not stopped to this day. The Kuomintang army in Shanxi is launching a fierce attack on the Liberated Areas in the southwest of Shanxi, south of the Fen River, and in the southwest of Taiyuan, in central Shanxi. In the Fen River area, more than 10,000 troops from the 39th Division of the 43rd Army, the 72nd Division of the 61st Army, and the Ai Xiang Tuan of the Yan Xishan army have been besieging the Jiwang Mountain area in Jishan and Wanquan since the 17th of last month, and have successively invaded and occupied Dongxijing Village, Zhaidianzhen, Wan'an, Wangdimiao, Zhangjiaqiu, and other places. At the beginning of this month, the 31st Division of the 27th Army and the 167th Division of the First Army of the Kuomintang reinforced them, and the combined forces increased to more than 22,000. On the 4th, they occupied Jiwang Mountain. On the 7th and 8th, they launched a fierce attack on the Tongpu Railway area between Wenxi and Houma, and the war has been expanding day by day. In the southwest of Taiyuan, after the Yan Xishan army invaded and occupied the plains of Qingyuan, Taiyuan, and Xuzhou in mid-May, they reinforced them at the beginning of this month and continued to commit crimes. On the 6th of this month, the 71st Division of the Yan army in Yangqu, the 44th Division of the Yan army in Qixian, the 208th and 209th Regiments of the Yan army in Fenyang, the puppet Ninth Column and the puppet Fourth Independent Regiment in Qingyuan Jiaocheng, and hundreds of Japanese troops, divided into three routes, simultaneously attacked the Liberated Areas in Qixian, Jiaocheng, Wenshui, and Fenyang, and invaded and occupied more than ten villages and towns such as Xishe, Beishe, Hujiabao, Yanjiaobao, Changfeng, Wangmingzhai, Gaobaizhen, Yunzhou, Qiyang, Caojiabao, Weijiazhuang, Guxian, and Wangchun. The war in Hebei occurred in the areas south and east of Beiping. On May 15th, four regiments of the Kuomintang army and puppet troops from Huanghudian, Luodai, and Langfang, under the command of Li Zhengxian, commander of the 16th Army, and Feng Long, commander of the 27th Division of the 16th Army, launched fierce attacks on Lixianzhen in Panggezhuang and Anci County, north of the Yongding River and south of Beiping. After occupying Anci and Panggezhuang, they continued to occupy Lixian, Yufa, and other places, and carried out "sweeping" and "suppression" in the entire Liberated Area between the Yongding River and the Beining Railway. After the American representative of the Executive Group investigated, and proposed that the Kuomintang army should withdraw from the occupied areas, the Kuomintang representative, feeling unreasonable and at a loss for words, withdrew from the group on his own and refused to continue the investigation. On May 25th, six battalions of the 121st Division and one battalion of the 43rd Division of the Kuomintang 94th Army, with the cooperation of airplanes, tanks, and artillery, besieged Shengfang Town, west of Tianjin. After a week of fierce fighting, they were repelled. On May 29th and 30th, the Kuomintang army, with two divisions, launched an attack on Xianghe and Sanhe areas east of Beiping from Tongxian and Miyun.

In summary, the Kuomintang military authorities not only tore up the Northeast Civil War Agreement, which they were originally unwilling to establish and implement, but also have already launched large-scale civil wars in various parts of Guan Nei, and even in areas dozens of kilometers near the locations of the Tripartite Committee and the Beiping Executive Headquarters. Due to various acts of sabotage by the Kuomintang, the Executive Headquarters is unable to carry out mediation tasks. The above is the recent situation. In the five months since January 12th, the Kuomintang army has occupied hundreds of villages and towns in the Liberated Areas, and 40 county seats. Among them, 14 have been recovered by us, but 26 county seats are still occupied. The total population of these occupied urban and rural areas is as high as 3 million. This situation has now forced some local CCP troops to take a preliminary step of self-defense, namely, to implement the step of disarming the puppet troops that had already been agreed upon. Chen Yi, commander of the Fourth Army of Shandong, telegraphed the Tripartite Committee and the Beiping Executive Headquarters at the beginning of this month, requesting them to quickly stop the Kuomintang army's attack on the Jiangsu-Anhui border region, and immediately disband the puppet troops in Zaozhuang, but to no avail. From the 7th to the 10th, he disarmed the puppet troops in Zaozhuang, Dawenkou, Tai'an, Jiaoxian, Zhangdian, Zhoucun, and Dexian. The Eighth Route Army of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu will also disarm the puppet bandit Xu Tieying's troops in Yongding, southern Hebei. Authoritative CCP sources stated that the CCP will never tolerate the Kuomintang's endless perfidious attacks, but the CCP has always strived for a peaceful solution to all disputes in Northeast China and the whole country. The CCP not only requires the faithful implementation of the 16-day ceasefire in Northeast China, but also firmly requires the realization of a permanent ceasefire throughout China (including Northeast China), and the disarming of puppet troops, precisely in order to implement the agreement and eliminate factors that undermine peace. The CCP requires the Kuomintang authorities to immediately stop their attacks and "suppression" in Northeast China, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanxi, and Yudong, and to implement Order No. 6 of the Peace Agreement, so that China's peace can regain a reasonable foundation. The CCP side declared: We demand a long-term and comprehensive ceasefire, not for 15 days, but for decades, not only in Northeast China, but throughout the country. The CCP is willing to be friends with those who support peace; even if the CCP does not want to be enemies with those who support war, the people of the whole country will be forced to rise up and be enemies with them.

    国民党内好战集团指挥下
    顽伪不断挑战局势严重
    中共表示：凡赞成和平者，中共愿与为友：凡赞成战争，即使中共不欲与之为敌，恐全国人民亦将被迫起而与之为敌。
    【新华社延安十三日电】国民党再与各地伪军，在国民党内好战集团的指挥之下，不顾迭次停战协议与执行部之和平努力，对于解放区作无止境的挑战，已使中国局势十分严重。最近的重要发展如下：
    （一）东北方面：在东北十五天休战命令生效以后，杜聿明所指挥的国民党军，在拉法、海城、本溪、法库等方面，继续进攻东北民主联军。七日午后起，永吉以及拉法方面的国民党军，向拉法东南蛟河县城进攻。并以飞机猛炸蛟河、敦化等地。七日午后新开海城之新一军新三十八师一部，向海城东南民主联军阵地进攻，于激战后，占领唐王山、罗家堡子等地，并续向海城东南二十公里之军事要地析木城进攻。海城以北鞍山之国民党六十军一八二师，亦于同时向鞍山东南十公里之白五寨及其南之小女寨进攻。本溪之国民党五十二军原部，于十日十二时后，亦分由本溪西南四十五公里之浪子山，及本溪以南十五公里之桥头，以猛烈炮火攻击附近民主联军阵地。八日晨八时，法库西南二十五公里丁家房身之国民党军两个团，又向法库发动猛攻，经过四小时激战后，进占法库西南十五公里大小房身之线，其先遣部队则续进至法库西南十余华里之四台子附近。法库东南四十公里铁岭之国民党军一部，亦于同时发动，向法库进攻，并于激战后，占领法库东南三十公里之镇西堡。以上各线战事，现均在继续进行中。
    （二）苏皖山东方面：国民党军于四月二十七日一度袭占几县。五月十日，一度袭占夏邑。以后复于五月十一日起，集合第七十三军七十七师，第四十八军一三八师，第七军一七一师、一七二师，及安徽八专署独立第二、第三两保安团，向苏皖边区第四分区（安徽津浦铁路以西，淮南铁路以东地区），大举进攻，于十三日侵占该区中心定远县城后，仍继续在全区实行所谓全面“清剿”，占领藕塘镇等重要市镇四十余处，并再三拒绝执行组前往调处。在苏皖第四分区战争，尚在继续进行之际，七十三军七十七师与七十四军五十八师又于本月七日上午九时大举进攻苏皖第三分区（津浦路东，运河以西，淮河以南地区），于七日下午攻占来安县城，九日又增一七二师与二十五军一○八师共四个师兵力到六合、仪征、来安、明光四处向该分区分头猛犯，已攻占镛家集、新黄港、月塘集等地，战争激烈。此外，南通之国民党四十九军，与泰兴之国民党一百军十九师，自上月二十九日以来，亦积极出犯、已先后侵占小海镇、兴仁镇、秦灶、陈家桥、大撇港、新坝、九华山、丁润店、镇场镇（现已收复）、新镇市、毗芦市、华桥、宣家堡（现已收复）、大泗庄（现已收复）等重要村镇十余处。现苏皖边区南线，西起定远、滁县、来安、六合、仪征，东至扬州、泰州、泰兴、靖江、南通、海门，均已卷入战争，形势异常紧迫。在北线之徐州方面国民党五十八军一八三师三个团，亦于六日猛攻萧县、铜山解放区，已侵占石相集、杨庄、衣桥、贾楼、潘塘、林町等地。山东枣庄伪军王继美部，大汶口、泰安伪军宁春霖部，胶县伪军赵保元部，张店、周村伪军张景月部，德县伪军杨毓洵等部，虽迭经国共会谈纪要、政协决议、整军方案等，决定立即予以解散，但至今国民党方面仍与之勾结，指示其不断进攻解放区，残杀解放区军民。枣庄伪军更于五月二十一日，将执行组中共代表甘重斗译电员吴武汉凶殴垂毙。国民党方面，对于中共解散此等伪军之要求，仍置之不理。
    （三）河南山西河北方面：河南陇海路南新黄河以东睢县、杞县、太康、陈留一带之豫东解放区，于五月十一日起，受到国民党六十八军八十一师、五十五军一八一师、伪军张岚峰部，及地方保安队两万余人的围攻，国民党军于侵陷该区湖庄、砖楼、长岗、龙曲等数十市镇后，继续在全区反复“清剿”，屡杀民主政权干部与和平居民，至今不止。山西的国民党军正在山西西南汾河以南地区、与山西中部太原西南地区，向解放区举行猛攻，在汾南地区阎锡山所属四十三军三十九师、六十一军七十二师、及阎军爱乡团等部一万余人，于上月十七日起，开始向稷山万泉一带之稷王山地区实行围攻，先后侵陷东西景村、翟店镇、万安、王地庙、张家丘等地，至本月初，国民党二十七军三十一师，第一军一六七师又增援，合犯兵力增至二万二千余人，于四日占领稷王山，七八两日复向闻喜、候马间之同蒲线地区猛攻，战事已日趋扩大。在太原西南地区，阎锡山军于五月中旬侵占清源、太原、徐州一带平原地区后，又于本日初增援续犯，本月六日阳曲阎军七十一师，祁县阎军四十四师，汾阳阎军二○八团、二○九团，清源交城之伪九纵队伪独四团，及日军数百，分三路向祁县、交城、文水、汾阳一带解放区同时进攻，侵占西社、北社、胡家堡、阎家堡、常丰、王明寨、高白镇、云周、骑阳、曹家堡、未家庄、固贤、望春等村镇十余处。河北的战事发生于北平以南与以东地区，五月十五日，国民党军四个团及皇后店、落岱、廊坊等处伪军，由十六军军长李正先及十六军二十七师师长冯龙指挥，分向北平以南永定河以北之庞各处的礼贤镇、与安次县城猛攻，在占领安次庞各庄后，续占礼贤、榆垡等地，向永定河与北宁路间之整块解放区实行“扫荡”“清剿”，在执行组美方代表调查后，提出国民党军应自占领区撤退时，国民党代表因理屈词穷，乃自行脱离小组，拒绝继续调查。五月二十五日，国民党九十四军一二一师六个营与四十三师一个营，配合飞机坦克大炮，围攻天津以西的胜芳镇，激战一周后，始被击退。五月二十九日三十日，国民党军以两个师的兵力，分由通县方面与密云方面，进攻北平以东的香河，三河地区。
    综合上述情况，国民党军事当局不但撕毁了他们所本来不愿成立与实行的东北内战协议，而且已经在关内各地，甚至在三人委员会与北平执行部所在地附近数十公里内地区，发生大规模的内战，而执行部由于国民党方面的种种破坏，对之竟无法执行调处任务。以上是最近的情形。无论一月十二日以来的五个月中，则国民党军共占解放区村镇数百处，县城四十个，其中除十四个被我收复外，尚有二十六个县城被占。此等被占领城乡之人口总数达三百万人之多。此种情势，现已迫使一部分地方的中共军队，不得不采取一种最初步的自卫步骤，即执行早经协议已解除伪军武装的步骤。山东第四军军长陈毅，曾于本月初电请三人委员会与北平执行后，迅即制止国民党军对苏皖边区的进攻，并即解散枣庄伪军，未获结果，已于七日至十日，解除枣庄、大汶口、泰安、胶县、张店、周村、德县各地罪大恶极的伪军的武装。晋冀鲁豫八路军，亦将解除冀南永定伪匪许铁英部之武装。中共权威方面表示，中共决不能忍受国民党方面无止境的背信弃义的进攻，但中共始终力求和平解决东北与全国的一切纷争，中共不但要求忠实履行东北十六天休战，而且坚决要求实现全中国（包括东北在内）的永远停战，解除伪军武装，正是为了执行协议与消灭破坏和平的因素。中共要求国民党当局立即停止其在东北与苏、皖、山西、豫东专署的进攻与“清剿”，并执行和字第六号命令，则中国和平始可重得合理的基础。中共方面宣称：我们要求长期全面停战，不是十五天，而是几十年，不但是东北，而且是全国。凡赞成和平者，中共愿与为友；凡赞成战争者，即使中共不欲与之为敌，恐全国人民亦被迫起而与之为敌。
