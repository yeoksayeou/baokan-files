Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, May 31st: Due to the continued attacks by the Nationalist troops invading Jehol along the Chih (Feng) - Yeh (Bo Shou) line, the Eighth Route Army in the area was forced to defend themselves and launched a counterattack, and have now recovered the entire Chih-Yeh line. The towns of Pingzhuang, Gushan, Molihuo, Nailin and other places along the Chih-Yeh line were occupied by the 162nd Regiment of the 54th Division of the Nationalist 13th Army on the fifth day after the ceasefire order came into effect on January 19th. After occupying the area, the regiment extensively constructed fortifications, recruited bandits, and continuously harassed the liberated areas. In late March, the local Eighth Route Army repeatedly proposed to the regiment to conclude a local ceasefire agreement in order to maintain peace, but the regiment not only refused to adopt it, but also intensified its attacks on the Eighth Route Army in mid-May, and carried out a cruel "mopping-up" burning and killing campaign in the liberated areas. The Eighth Route Army, unable to endure it any longer, rose up and resolutely counterattacked, and with the enthusiastic support of the local people, recovered Nailin, Molihuo, Pingzhuang and other places. The invading 162nd Regiment was completely routed, with more than 400 soldiers laying down their weapons or being captured, and more than 600 casualties.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, May 31st: In recent days, Nationalist troops have continued to attack the liberated areas from various locations, and the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army have been forced to resolutely defend themselves, inflicting blows on the invading troops. In the Jin-Cha-Ji area, the Nationalist troops, with the aim of occupying the Ping-Jin-Bao triangle area, have now concentrated their attacks on Sheng Huashi, a prosperous town more than 400 miles from Tianjin, after being stubbornly resisted by the Eighth Route Army in central Hebei. On the morning of the 25th, 2,000 soldiers from the 121st Division of the Nationalist Army, combined with puppet troops, under the cover of two airplanes, three tanks, and light and heavy mortars, launched a fierce attack on Sheng Hua from the southeast, northwest, and due north directions, charging more than ten times, but were all bravely repulsed by the defending troops. After a day and night of fierce fighting, more than 300 invading soldiers were killed or wounded, and one tank was destroyed. The division continued to attack on the 26th, and fierce fighting is still underway. In the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area, puppet troops in Pingyuan, Yucheng, Changqing and other places have continuously launched attacks, but were all repulsed. More than 1,000 soldiers from the Zhang Benting unit of the Changqing puppet army were repulsed when they attacked Pingfang (17 miles south of the city) on the 15th, losing 136 men. More than 300 soldiers from the Cheng Jingfu unit of the Yucheng puppet army deserted during the attack. A unit of the puppet army in Yuanshi, Pinghan Road, numbering about 1,000, attacked twice on the 20th without success. In Shandong, the 12th Regiment of the Nationalist Army's Provisional 15th Division reoccupied Dahegou in the Licheng liberated area on the 20th. In the southern line of the Su-Wan liberated area, the Nationalist troops continued to attack from Nantong, Liuhe, Dingyuan and other places. The Nationalist 49th Army in Nantong launched attacks in three routes on the 25th, and fierce fighting is underway on all routes. Liujiazhuang (8 miles southeast of Shaobo), which was occupied by the 40th Division of the Nationalist 25th Army on the 22nd, has been recovered by the New Fourth Army after abandoning the battle. At the same time as the Nationalist troops' land offensives, the Nationalist authorities have been using American-made airplanes to continuously fly to various places for reconnaissance, strafing and bombing. On the 20th, a Nationalist airplane strafed Ziya Town in Beiping. On the 22nd, two airplanes reconnoitered the Sanhe, Xianghe, and Fengrun areas in eastern Hebei. On the 15th and 16th, two airplanes reconnoitered Xinzhen and Ba County in central Hebei, and strafed over Xinzhen. On the 23rd and 24th, 13 Nationalist airplanes bombed Dongming City, dropping more than 50 bombs, wounding more than 20 soldiers and civilians.
