　　Spokesperson of the Jin-Sui Military Region Talks About the Liberation of Shuoxian, Xuangang and Other Places
　　Reiterates Warning to Yan's Puppet Troops: If They Do Not Withdraw from Occupied Areas, We Will Continue to Adopt Self-Defense Measures and Give More Forceful Counterattacks
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 20th] The spokesperson of the Jin-Sui Military Region recently issued a statement regarding the Eighth Route Army's liberation of Shuoxian, Xuangang and other places, stating: Since the ceasefire order, the Yan's puppet troops have intensified their attacks on the liberated areas in coordination with the Japanese army. Our side, bearing the overall national interest in mind, has repeatedly yielded and refrained from counterattacks. Not only has the Yan army shown no sign of repentance, but since May 15th, they have concentrated five divisions, two puppet army columns, and the Japanese 227th Battalion to launch a large-scale offensive against the Jinzhong Pingchuan liberated area. Over two hundred villages in Taiyuan, Qingyuan, Xugou, Jiaocheng, and Wenshui have suffered from the devastation and looting by the puppet troops. This perfidious offensive is still expanding. On the northern front, the 3rd Regiment of the 10th Division of the Yan army (originally the 3rd Division of the Provincial Defense Force) attacked the 3rd District of our Guoxian County on May 24th, burning to death Comrade Zhao Angan, deputy commissioner of the 6th Sub-district and concurrently the head of Xinxian County, and over twenty others in Yongxing Village. On June 10th, the 45th Regiment of the Yan army in Shuoxian County (originally the Datong puppet police), in coordination with over 400 Japanese soldiers and two artillery pieces, surrounded our guerrilla battalion stationed in Xixiaozhai and Jiazhuang, 25 miles southeast of Shuoxian City. Apart from those who died heroically, over fifty people, including the battalion commander, were captured. The Yan army's offensive is still continuing. Under these circumstances, our army has had to take necessary self-defense measures to disarm the puppet troops. On the morning of the 17th, our army, at the request of the local people, liberated Shuoxian City and Xuangang, and completely eliminated the puppet troops stationed there. The spokesperson of the military region firmly stated: We once again warn the Yan's puppet troops that if they do not immediately stop their offensive and automatically withdraw from all the areas they have occupied since January 13th, we will continue to take self-defense measures and give them a more forceful counterattack.

　　关于解放朔县轩岗等地
    晋绥军区发言人谈话
    再次警告阎伪军如不自侵占地区撤退
    我将继续采自卫手段给以更有力反击
    【新华社兴县廿日电】晋绥军区发言人，顷就八路军解放朔县、轩岗等地，发表谈话称：阎伪军自停战令以来，配合日军向解放区进攻日益加剧。我方相忍为国，一再退让，未予反击。阎军不特毫无反悔之意，并自五月十五日后，更集中五个师、两个伪军纵队、及日军二二七大队，向晋中平川解放区大举进攻。太原、清源、徐沟、交城、文水二百余村庄，遭受伪军蹂躏抢劫。这种背信弃义的进攻，目前仍在扩展中。在北线之阎军十师三团（原为省防第三师），于五月廿四日进攻我崞县三区，在永兴村烧死我六分区副专员兼忻县县长赵安干同志等二十余人。六月十日朔县阎军四十五团（原为大同伪警察），配合日军四百余，附炮二门，将我驻朔县城东南二十五里之西小寨、贾庄游击大队包围，大队长以下五十余人，除壮烈牺牲者外，余均被俘。现阎军之进攻仍继续中。在这种情况下，我军不得不采取必要的自卫手段，解除伪军武装。十七日晨，我军即应当地人民之请求，解放朔县城、轩岗，并将驻于该地之伪军全部解决。军区发言人坚称：我们再次警告阎伪军，如不立即停止进攻，并从一月十三日以来所侵占之全部地区自动撤退，我将继续采取自卫手段，给以更有力的反击。
