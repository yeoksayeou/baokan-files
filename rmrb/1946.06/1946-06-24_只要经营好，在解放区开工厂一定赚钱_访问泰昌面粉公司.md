　　As long as it's managed well, opening a factory in the Liberated Area will definitely be profitable
    ——Visiting Taichang Flour Company

    Visiting Taichang Flour Company and discussing issues related to the company with Managers Zhang and Ma, and Mr. Guo Da, gave me a strong impression: running industry in the Liberated Area, as long as it's managed well, will definitely be profitable.

    This company has experienced three different eras. It was founded in 1920, initially producing flour only with stone mills. It gradually expanded, and by 1929, it had increased to five steel roller mills, with a maximum daily output of 1,200 bags, nearly 50,000 catties. After the incident (likely referring to the September 18th Incident), the enemy occupied it. First, it was under "military administration," and later it was changed to "Nitto" and "Nikka" companies, manufacturing rationed flour for the enemy and puppets. Apart from a few pro-enemy major shareholders who could collect some scraps from the enemy, the general shareholders could only stare at useless stocks, secretly resentful and sighing.

    After the enemy surrendered, the Japanese withdrew from Handan, and the puppet Guo Huamin's troops used their main force to guard this company. Obviously, they saw that this was a profitable business. Fortunately, the Eighth Route Army fought well and quickly, and the puppet troops were annihilated within four hours before they could even damage the machines. The company was completely recovered intact, and all employees safely liberated.

    Work started on the third day. The democratic government gave each worker two large bags of grain, one large bag of beans, and 1,000 yuan to heal the wounds they had suffered under the long-term oppression of the enemy and puppets. Working hours were reduced from twelve to eight hours. The workers' enthusiasm for production soared. During the Pinghan Campaign, when the civil war invaders' artillery fire was already threatening the company's vicinity, the employees remained calm and worked diligently day and night to supply military and civilian food. The workers' long-buried creative genius began to be unearthed. Shi Huaizhi refined cylinder oil himself, and Wang Kai was promoted to head of the general affairs section, demonstrating excellent organizational skills. Last New Year's Eve, when the workers were bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new, they accused the enemy of the pain they had inflicted on them in the past and reflected on the happiness they had gained today. One worker said meaningfully: "In previous years, not being able to pay debts during the New Year was a disgrace. This year, we have food and clothing, and no one bullies us."

    The government's policy of developing private capital brought good news to old shareholders and wealthy people. Manager Zhang said: "Now the company's capital is divided into three types: one is the enemy property confiscated by the government, and the other is the investment made by the government after taking over. The government has already auctioned these two parts to private individuals. The third type is the original owners' property, which is currently temporarily managed by the government. Once it is verified that they did not cooperate with the enemy and hold the original shares, their shareholding can be recognized unconditionally." He said: "The capitalists have all seen that this is a profitable business, and everyone is vying to invest, quickly raising 75 million yuan."

    New wheat is not yet on the market, so Taichang cannot operate regularly. When the enemy "managed" it, they were unwilling to repair the machines at any time, doing things perfunctorily. The machines were severely damaged, and the current output has not yet reached the proper level. Now the factory and all employees are actively repairing boilers, cylinders, and steel rollers, preparing to welcome the upcoming great production movement, so that the output will quickly reach the level of 800 bags per day.

    Talking about today's wages, Manager Zhang said: "The average has increased by 19% compared to before." The factory provides meals, one and two-tenths of a *dou* of rice and flour per day, including vegetable expenses, totaling 120 *jin* of rice per month. If the workers manage their own meals and cannot finish it, they can also divide several hundred yuan per month per person. Ordinary workers earn 140 *jin* of rice per month, and skilled workers earn 230 *jin*. In the past, there was a tendency to equalize the wages of workers and technicians. Now it has been corrected, and technicians can get 330 *jin* of rice per month in addition to meals. Employees all have medical subsidies and a weekly rest system has been implemented. Managers Zhang and Wang said that in order to maintain the shareholders' profits, we have extended the working hours somewhat, from eight hours to nine to ten hours. "As long as the production volume increases, workers can get more dividends, which is also good for them."

    Taichang now earns a net profit of more than 100,000 yuan a day, based on a minimum daily output of 500 bags, after deducting all expenses. "Is it still possible to increase wages?" Manager Zhang said confidently: "This is entirely possible. We plan to increase the output to 800 bags, and the cost will be relatively reduced. The output will increase by 60%, and the profit can increase several times. We must continue to raise funds, expand working capital, effectively control raw materials, save as much coal and machine oil as possible, and try to increase some operating profits—in this way, the annual dividends can reach more than double the total capital."

    Indeed, running industry in the Liberated Area, the help and support of the democratic government is a given. In terms of the natural conditions for developing industry, it is also very good. First of all, there are abundant raw materials, with plenty of wheat on the Jinnan Plain. Secondly, there is a sales market. Based on a daily output of 800 bags, which is more than 30,000 *jin*, Handan sells more than 10,000 *jin* per day, and the rest can be sold to Xingtai and nearby counties. Only transportation is temporarily more difficult. Taichang plans to buy some horse-drawn carts and try to utilize river transportation.

    The factory believes that "today's main problem is how to operate the factory more scientifically." "As long as it is managed well, the business has a broad future." They feel that the current organization of the factory is not tight enough, the operation is not compact enough, and there is still some waste in the use of manpower. They plan to appropriately adjust the ratio of manual workers to machine workers, reduce some manual workers, and hire short-term workers during busy times. For things like sewing flour bags, they try to utilize social surplus labor, which can save the expense of setting up such a specialized organization and solve the living problems of some poor citizens. The factory structure is being adjusted, and the management system is also being studied and improved, preparing and preparing to welcome the great production movement.

    Manager Zhang emphasized that labor-capital cooperation is the key to developing production today. The living standards of workers have improved, and the workers' production morale is quite good now. In the future, we should continue to pay attention to treatment, and the trade union can further strengthen worker education, so that their enthusiasm is higher, their sense of responsibility is greater, their output is increased, and their costs are reduced, so that the factory can earn more money and the workers can share more dividends; this is a win-win situation, and it is also our goal for future efforts.

### 只要经营好，在解放区开工厂一定赚钱——访问泰昌面粉公司

　　只要经营好，在解放区开工厂一定赚钱
    ——访问泰昌面粉公司
    苏棣
    访问泰昌面粉公司，和张、马经理及郭达先生研究了有关该公司的一些问题；使我得到了一个强烈的印象：在解放区办工业，只要经营得好，一定会赚钱的。
    这个公司经历了三个不同的时代。它开创于民国九年，最初只以石磨制粉。以后逐渐扩大，到十八年增至五炉钢磨，每天最高产量达一千二百袋，近五万斤。事变后敌人侵据了它，先是“军管理”，以后又改为“日东”、“日华”公司，替敌伪制造配给面。除了个别附敌大股东能收拾敌人一些唾余以外，一般的股东们只能干看着无用的股票，暗暗的愤恨与叹息。
    敌人投降后，日本人退出邯郸，伪郭化民部以主力扼守这个公司。很显然，他们看出了这是一个赚钱的生意。幸亏八路军打得又好又快，伪军们还没有来得及破坏机器，在四小时内就被歼灭了。公司完整的收复过来，全体职工安全的获得解放。
    第三天就开了工。民主政府给每个工人发了两大袋谷子，一大袋豆子和一千块钱，医治他们在敌伪长期压榨下所受的创伤。工作时间由十二小时减为八小时。工人们的生产情绪飞跃提高，在平汉战役的时候，内战进犯军的炮火已经威胁到公司的附近，职工们却依然沉着而紧张的昼夜工作，供给军用民食。工人们长期被埋没的创造天才开始发掘出来，师怀智自己提炼了汽缸油，王凯提升为事务股长，表现了优秀的组织力。去年除夕，工人们送旧迎新的时候，他们控诉过去敌人给予自己的痛苦，反省今天获得的快乐。一个工人意味深长的说：“往年过年还不了账，正是丢人的时候。今年又有吃有穿，没人欺侮了。”
    政府发展私人资本的政策给旧股东和有钱人带来了喜讯。张经理说：现在公司的资本分三种：一种是政府没收的敌产部分，一种是政府接办后的投资，这两部分政府已经拍卖给私人了。还有一种是原业主的产业，现在暂由政府代管，一俟查明未与敌人合作而持有原股票的，可以无条件的承认他们的股权。他说：资本家都看准了这是一个赚钱的生意，大家争相入股，很快的集起了七千五百万元。
    新麦没有上市，泰昌还不能经常开工。敌人“管理”时对机器不愿随时修整，敷衍凑合，机器废损很厉害，现在的产量还未能达到应有的水平。现在厂方和全体职工正在积极修理锅炉、汽缸、钢滚，准备迎接即将到来的大生产运动。使产量很快的达到每天八百袋的水平。
    谈到今日的工资，张经理说：“平均比以前增加了百分之十九。”工厂管饭，每天一米两面，连菜金在内，每月合一百二十斤米。工人自己管理伙食，吃不完，每月每人还可分几百元。普通工人每月工资米一百四十斤，技术工人二百三十斤。过去曾经发生过工人和技师工资平均化的偏向，现在纠正了，技师除了吃饭，每月可得三百三十斤工资米。职工们都有医药补助费。并且实行了星期休息制。张、王经理说过，为了保持股东们的利润，我们又把工作时间延长了些。从八小时增至九至十小时。“只要生产量增加了，工人可多分些红利，对他们也有好处的。”
    泰昌现在开一天工，以最低日产五百袋计算，除去一切开支，可赚纯利十几万元。“还能没有可能增加工资呢？”张经理满有信心的说：“这是完全可能的。我们准备提高产量到八百袋，成本相对降低，产量提高百分之六十，利润可增加数倍。我们要继续招股，扩大流动资金，确实掌握原料，尽量节省煤炭，机器油等消耗，并设法增加一部分营业利润——这样每年所得红利，可达全部资金的一倍以上。”
    的确，在解放区办工业，民主政府的帮助扶植是不必说了，就以发展工业的自然条件来说，也是非常之好的。首先是原料充裕，冀南平原有的是麦子。其次是销路，以每天生产八百袋计算，为三万多斤，邯郸日销一万多斤，其余可行销邢台及附近各县。只是运输，暂时比较困难，泰昌准备自己买一些马车，并尽量利用河运。
    工厂方面认为：“今天的主要问题是怎样能把工厂经营得更科学化些。”“只要经营得好，事业是有广旷前途的。”他们觉得今天工厂的组织还不够严密，经营不够紧凑，在人力使用上还多少有些浪费的现象。他们准备适当调整劳动工人和机器工人的比例，减少些劳动工人，在忙碌时候雇短工。象缝面袋之类的事情，尽量利用社会剩余劳力工作，自己可节省设置这种专门机构的开支，又可解决一部分贫苦市民的生活问题。工厂机构正在调整，管理制度也正在研究改进，准备再准备，准备迎接大生产运动的到来。
    张经理强调的说：劳资合作是今天发展生产的关键。工人的生活待遇是提高了，现在工人的生产情绪已相当好。今后我们在待遇方面当继续注意，工会在工人教育上也能进一步加强，使他们的积极性更高，责任心更大，增加产量，减低成本，使厂方多赚些钱，工人多分些红利；这是一举两得的事，也是我们今后努力的目标。
