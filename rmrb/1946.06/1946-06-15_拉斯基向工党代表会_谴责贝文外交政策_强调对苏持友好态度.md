Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: London dispatch: The British Labour Party's 45th Annual Conference opened in Bournemouth on the 10th. Attending were 1,170 delegates representing 3,289,000 voting members. The conference will discuss British domestic and foreign policy, amend the party constitution, and address the issue of the British Communist Party's application to join the Labour Party. Labour Party Chairman Laski presided over the conference. In his opening address, international issues took a prominent place. He criticized Bevin's foreign policy, particularly regarding Spain, Greece, and Palestine. When he emphasized friendly relations with the Soviet Union and called for the disclosure of atomic energy secrets, he received enthusiastic applause from the audience. On the first day, the conference passed a comprehensive resolution calling on the government to adopt a friendly and understanding attitude towards the Soviet Union, as well as a resolution demanding that the government take stern action to prevent the resurgence of fascism in Britain (another proposal to enact new anti-fascist legislation was not passed). The conference also passed a telegram of congratulations to Italy celebrating the establishment of its republic. The debate on the British Communist Party's application to join the Labour Party will be held on Wednesday.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: According to Reuters, London: British Home Secretary Ede read a statement to the House of Commons on the 6th regarding British Fascist Union leader Mosley accepting funds from Mussolini. He quoted letters from former Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi, to Mussolini, obtained from Mussolini's documents. These letters revealed that as early as 1934, Mosley had received funds from Mussolini for fascist activities. According to Grandi's letter dated March 1, 1934, he expressed gratitude to Mussolini for providing him with 60,000 gold pounds annually. However, when Labour MPs Chater and Warbey questioned Ede whether Mosley's behavior constituted "treason" and how the government would deal with it, Ede stated: "Mosley's behavior is not illegal."

    【新华社延安十二日电】据路透社伦敦讯：英内务大臣艾德六日曾对下院宣读英国法西斯联盟领袖莫斯莱接受墨索里尼款项的声明，他摘引从墨索里尼文件中所获的前意驻英大使格兰地，致墨氏的信，这些信件揭露远在一九三四年以前，莫斯莱就由墨索里尼代给款项，进行法西斯活动。据格兰地一九三四年三月一日的信说：他对墨索里尼每年供给其六万金镑表示感激。但是当工党议员辛德和瓦贝质问艾德：莫斯莱此种行为是否系“叛国行为”，政府如何处置时，艾德则称：“莫斯莱此种行为并不违法”。
