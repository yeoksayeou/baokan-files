    To Guarantee the Victorious Completion of the Five-Year Plan
    Soviet Union Launches Production Emulation
    Laboring People Bravely Devote Themselves to the Movement
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 6th] Moscow Dispatch: Over the past two weeks, a socialist emulation campaign has been surging in the Soviet Union. Metalworkers are demanding the completion of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Every day, new forces from the Soviet working class are joining this movement. Now, heavy industry constructors have also joined, planning to restore and build 5,900 factories and 220 towns. This year, they will restore 90 towns and rebuild industrial centers in the Urals, Siberia, the Volga region, Central Asia, and the Transcaucasus. Over the next five years, Soviet industry will produce over 1,400 new diesel-powered electric locomotives. These new locomotives can haul trains carrying approximately 6,000 tons of cargo at speeds of 70 to 90 kilometers per hour. Additionally, tens of thousands of locomotives will be supplied to the countryside, primarily to the severely damaged Ukraine and Belarus. A major plan for the modernization of railways in the Baltic republics and the laying of double tracks has also been drafted. Within five years, 25 million new high-power steam locomotives, 250 diesel locomotives, and over 800 carriages will be supplied to railways connecting the central and eastern parts of the country. In the fuel industry, the construction of the 520-kilometer-long Demyansk-Kyiv gas pipeline has begun. This gas pipeline will supply the needs of dozens of industrial enterprises and large sugar factories. Workers are now bravely engaging in emulation to complete this plan.
