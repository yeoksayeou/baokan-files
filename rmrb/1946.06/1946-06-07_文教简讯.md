	Pangcun Elementary School in Our City Promotes Student Self-Governance
	For over a decade, Pangcun Elementary School in Handan City had been using old teaching methods with old teachers, resorting to corporal punishment such as paddling and kneeling, resulting in a yearly decline in student enrollment. This year, new teachers were brought in, corporal punishment was abolished, and teaching methods were changed, allowing students to manage themselves. Students reflected, saying, "We have also been liberated." Enthusiasm for learning is high, and student enrollment has increased by more than ten. (Bo Gang)
	Xingtai City Establishes Joint Chorus
	Student extracurricular cultural life in Xingtai City schools is becoming increasingly active. During the memorial service for the "April 8th" martyrs, the Peking University and Xingtai Normal School students, a chorus of over a hundred male and female students performing an elegy, garnered praise from all sectors of society. In April, the Pingyuan Theater initiated the establishment of the Xingtai Joint Chorus. Currently, 502 members from various schools participate, forming nine teams based on different institutions and schools. Comrades Li Min and Zhou Peiran have been elected as the chairman and vice-chairman, respectively. They are currently rehearsing songs such as "The Army and the People are One Family" and "Master of Our Own Fate." In the future, cultural and entertainment life in Xingtai will become even more vibrant. (Yu Miao)
