[This newspaper Yangcheng News] The masses in the Shimin Fifth District, after years of drought, are striving for "Cultivate Four, Rest One" throughout the district this year with production efforts exceeding previous years. Under the slogan of self-cultivation, self-spinning, self-weaving, and self-clothing, the district planted 4,033 mu of cotton, 2,500 mu more than last year. Based on last year's average yield (15 jin of net cotton per mu), the output can be increased by 37,990 jin, an average of 4 jin and 12 liang per person. The district currently has 1,028 spinning wheels and 1,064 spinning women. With four months of spinning and weaving, each person spinning 4 liang per day, they can spin 30,840 jin. After setting aside cotton for cotton-padded clothes, they can completely supply their own spinning needs. The district currently has 87 looms. Within four months, with each person weaving 1 zhang and 5 chi per day, they can weave 15,660 zhang. Assuming each person needs 3 zhang and 2 chi of cloth per year, there is still a shortage of 12,2056 zhang. Currently, 68 more looms are being added, which will enable self-weaving and self-clothing. Secondly, in terms of household sideline occupations, they are promoting large-scale pig raising. According to statistics from the three villages of Xibu, Hexi, and Zhengzhuang in the district, there are already 106 pigs of all sizes. The district now has an average of one pig for every seven and a half households, and this year they will strive to have one pig for every three households. In terms of labor mutual aid, the district has now developed 149 male mutual aid groups with 1,343 people, and 11 female mutual aid groups with 121 people, accounting for one-third of the total labor force. Cadres personally participate in mutual aid groups and implement a combination of production and transportation to ensure the consolidation and continued expansion of mutual aid groups. In terms of grain production, in addition to cotton production, the district has 50,000 mu of summer and autumn land. They are striving to achieve a yield of one shi per mu in the autumn harvest. The district has 8,833 people, with an average income of 5 shi and 6 dou and 6 sheng per person. Coupled with income from silkworm raising and transportation, the district can achieve "Cultivate Four, Rest One".

[This newspaper Yangcheng News] The masses in Beidui Administrative Village in the Second District of Jincheng have completed sowing through mutual aid and completely eliminated all fallow land in the village after rent reduction. From April 5th, with Yang Jizhu, Li Zhengxin, Li Fabao, and Li Qinghai, who are activists in rent reduction (and also labor heroes), as the core, the village began to organize mutual aid. Until now, the entire village has organized 28 mutual aid groups, with 137 participants (five to seven people per group). All 97 able-bodied laborers in the village participated, and 40 semi-able-bodied laborers also participated, accounting for four-sixths of the semi-able-bodied laborers. Among them, 44 militiamen also fully participated. The village has 12 livestock and a total of 2,400 mu of land (including 1,060 mu of wheat land). In addition to using the 12 livestock to organize plowing, the remaining land was completely plowed by the mutual aid groups using qiang plows. In the upsurge of mutual challenge and competition among the groups, five people could plow four mu of land a day (land that had not been killed in the autumn). Four people used two qiang plows, and one person broke up the clods. From April 10th to May 8th, in less than a month, all 1,340 mu of autumn land in the village were completely planted, totaling 1,340 mu of millet, sorghum, and cotton. According to Xing Guangrong, a cadre of the village peasant association: "When we were not organized last year, everyone farmed their own land, and it took at least a month and a half to complete planting. This year, the entire village was organized and completed planting in just 28 days, completing it half a month early, saving a total of 2,055 workdays. From May 9th, the mutual aid groups began to collectively eliminate the more than 240 mu of fallow land that had been left uncultivated by the enemy. The plan was completed in just six days by May 15th, and jade corn planting began on the 16th."
