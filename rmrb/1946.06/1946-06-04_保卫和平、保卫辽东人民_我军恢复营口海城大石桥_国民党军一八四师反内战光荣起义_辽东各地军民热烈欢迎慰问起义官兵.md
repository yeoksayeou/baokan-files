    (Delayed) Liaoyang, June 1st, Xinhua News Agency: The Liaodong Military Region troops of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army simultaneously entered Haicheng, Dashiqiao, and Yingkou on the 30th of last month. The officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang Army's 184th Division, opposing the civil war, staged an uprising and were warmly welcomed by the local people. Following the recovery of Anshan on the 26th of last month, the Liaodong Military Region troops of the Democratic Allied Army advanced towards the above three locations. After three days of battle, after overcoming resistance, they completed the encirclement of Haicheng, Dashiqiao, and Yingkou. The directly subordinate units of the Kuomintang Army's 184th Division and the 552nd and 553rd Regiments stationed in the three cities, learning from the experience of the complete annihilation of the 551st Regiment in Anshan, saw through the Kuomintang authorities' deception that "the Democratic Allied Army is vulnerable." Furthermore, with the efforts of our army to win them over, they, under the leadership of Division Commander Pan Churi and Deputy Division Commander, opposed the civil war and staged an uprising. The Liaodong troops of the Democratic Allied Army then entered Haicheng, Dashiqiao, and Yingkou. Haicheng, Dashiqiao, and Yingkou were originally the defense areas of the Democratic Allied Army, and were occupied by the Kuomintang army in late March. This time, the recovery caused cheers from the masses. Currently, the military and civilians in various parts of Liaodong are warmly welcoming and comforting the officers and soldiers of the uprising 184th Division. General Zeng Kelin, Deputy Commander of the Liaodong Military Region of the Democratic Allied Army, and General Mo Wenhua, Deputy Political Commissar, also personally went to Haicheng on behalf of the military region to comfort the officers and soldiers of the 184th Division. According to the spokesperson of the Liaodong Military Region: In order to realize peace in Northeast China as soon as possible, the Democratic Allied Army voluntarily withdrew from Changchun, but the Kuomintang authorities still had no sincerity in ceasing hostilities. Chiang Kai-shek even went to Shenyang to command the civil war in Northeast China, singing loudly about the comprehensive "takeover" of Northeast China, while the Kuomintang army continued to attack peaceful people in various places. This time, the Democratic Allied Army recovered Anshan, Haicheng, Dashiqiao, and Yingkou precisely to defend peace and defend the people of Liaodong, and the glorious uprising of the officers and soldiers of the 184th Division is of great significance for crushing the reactionaries' large-scale civil war conspiracy and striving for domestic peace.

    辽东各地军民热烈欢迎慰问起义官兵
    【新华社辽阳一日电】（迟到）东北民主联军辽东军区部队，于上月三十日同时，进入海城、大石桥、营口，国民党军一八四师官兵反对内战，举行起义，受到当地民众热烈欢迎。继上月二十六日收复鞍山后，民主联军辽东军区部队，即向上述三地进军，经三日战斗，于排除抵抗后，完成对海城、大石桥、营口之包围，驻守三城之国民党军一八四师直属队及五五二团、五五三团，鉴于该师五五一团在鞍山全部覆没之经验，识破国民党当局“民主联军不堪一击”之欺骗；加以我军之努力争取，乃在师长潘初瑞及副师长领导下，反对内战，举行起义。民主联军辽东部队遂开入海城、大石桥、营口。按海城、大石桥、营口，原为民主联军防地，三月下旬为国民党军侵占，此次重行恢复，引起万众欢呼。现辽东各地军民正热烈欢迎与慰问起义之一八四师官兵，民主联军辽东军区副司令曾克林将军、副政委莫文骅将军，并代表军区亲至海城向一八四师官兵慰问。据辽东军区发言人谈：民主联军为求东北和平早日实现，曾自动撤出长春，但国民党当局，仍毫无停战诚意，蒋介石且亲往沈阳，指挥东北内战，高唱全面“接收”东北，国民党军则继续在各地进攻和平人民。此次民主联军收复鞍山、海城、大石桥、营口，正是为了保卫和平，保卫辽东人民，而一八四师官兵之光荣起义，对于粉碎反动派大规模内战阴谋，与争取国内和平，也有极大意义。
