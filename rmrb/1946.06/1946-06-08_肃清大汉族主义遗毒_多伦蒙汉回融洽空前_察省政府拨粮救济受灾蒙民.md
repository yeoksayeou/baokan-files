    Eliminate the Remaining Poison of Han Chauvinism
    Doron's Mongolian, Han, and Hui Peoples Achieve Unprecedented Harmony
    Chahar Provincial Government Allocates Grain to Relieve Disaster-Stricken Mongolian People
    Xinhua News Agency, Doron, 2nd. Doron City, located in the center of the lush Da'a Pasture, has 351 Han households, 419 Hui households, and the vast majority of the rest are Mongolian. Under the correct ethnic policies of the Chinese Communist Party, they have changed the past phenomenon of estrangement and exclusion caused by Han chauvinist rule, and their mutual relations have reached unprecedented harmony and unity. In addition to the Mongolian compatriots freely electing and establishing local autonomous governments, the Han and Hui people participate in elections and government affairs with equal qualifications. The democratically elected city representatives here include more than 20% Hui people, and the "Hui People's Democratic Nation-Building Association" organized by the Hui people themselves has also been established. The newly repaired roadbed from Doron to Beizi Temple is in good condition. In the past half month, four to five hundred Mongolians have been driving ox carts to Doron to exchange salt, cloth, grain and other necessities. They were warmly received by Han merchants. At the same time, when Han merchants went to various Mongolian banners to do business, the Mongolian people also volunteered to act as guides and provided enthusiastic food and accommodation. There are now five Mongolian primary schools and one Han primary school in Doron, using several languages for teaching.
    Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 2nd. The first batch of 2,500 large dan of grain from the Chahar Provincial Government to relieve the Mongolian people has been fully transported to various Mongolian banners and immediately distributed to the disaster-stricken Mongolian compatriots. Those who received relief included Doron Banner, Taipusi Left Banner, Taipusi Right Banner, Zhenglan Banner, Shangdu Banner, Ming'an Banner, Xiangbai Banner, Zhengbei Banner, and Xianghuang Banner. Each banner received between 200 and 400 dan of grain. More than 80% of the Mongolian compatriots who were relieved are farmers. The second batch of 2,500 dan of relief grain has also set off for various Mongolian banners. In order to develop Inner Mongolian industry and commerce, the Chahar Provincial Government has also provided a loan of 5 million yuan to Xilingol League and Ming'an Banner of Chahar League to establish wool spinning, leather and other factories.
