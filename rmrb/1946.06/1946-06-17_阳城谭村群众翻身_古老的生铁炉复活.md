Yangcheng, June 14th (From Our Newspaper) After the masses of Tancun, in the fourth district of Yangcheng, overturned their lives, they are actively engaged in production. Twenty impoverished masses in the village pooled together 21,000 yuan from the fruits of their labor after land redistribution. Under the leadership of the village head, Guan Xingyu, they revived an ancient pig iron furnace. From its commencement on April 1st to the end of May, it produced 1,000 catties of pig iron daily, totaling 25,000 catties. Over the two months, they earned a total of 116,600 yuan in labor wages. The five furnace workers each earned 5 catties of rice, 1 catty of flour, and 5 yuan for vegetables daily, amounting to 14,200 yuan. The nine miners, who mined 200,000 catties of ore, earned 30,000 yuan. The village's mutual aid team delivered raw materials to the furnace, including 110,000 catties of ore, 3,800 catties of black earth, 98,000 catties of charcoal, and 90,000 catties of dry earth, earning a total of 72,400 yuan in transportation fees. One furnace worker said, "This is a good way pointed out by the Communist Party for us to achieve a life of abundance." They are now planning to further develop their business, expand their capital, and add two more iron furnaces after the autumn harvest.
