備耕新事 (Bèi gēng xīnshì) - New Developments in Spring Plowing Preparation

    Widely Invite Heroes to Visit
    The Qingyihu Commune in Shuyang County, Jiangsu Province, has adopted the method of "organizing competitions and mutually arranging visits" to both compete and help each other, which has greatly promoted the preparation for spring plowing.

    There are three methods for mutually arranging visits: (1) A large team or a production team sends invitation letters inviting advanced units to come and give guidance; (2) Post a list to set up a challenge, widely inviting heroes to come; (3) Find one or several opponents, clarify the conditions, and agree on a time for mutual visits.

    Due to the active mobilization by the Party committee and the support of the masses, the competition of mutually arranged visits quickly unfolded. In the recent twenty days, the entire commune has issued more than eight hundred invitation letters, red notices, and mutual appointment letters, and more than two thousand verbal agreements were made. All four thousand two hundred and ten households in the commune have been投入 (tóurù) thrown into the competition upsurge. Teams echoed the slogan "Welcome visits, constantly make breakthroughs," and the momentum of spring plowing and planting became greater and greater, and work efficiency and quality continued to improve.

    The Wangchang Brigade, which achieved high corn yields last year, first issued an invitation letter "Widely Invite Heroes to Come to Visit." In order to produce better and greater results for visitors to see, the day the invitation letter was issued, the brigade mobilized four hundred laborers, deployed twenty-eight ox carts, and launched the "Hundred Lanterns Night Fertilizer Delivery" campaign. In the last seven days, the entire team delivered 200,000担 (dān) of fertilizer, and more than 80% of the 800+亩 (mǔ) of spring fields were fertilized. The Machang Brigade is the Wangchang Brigade's mutually appointed visiting opponent and also a neighboring team. In the evening, seeing the lanterns and torches of the Wangchang Brigade delivering fertilizer all night, they immediately held a meeting that night and proposed the slogan of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced, and immediately organized more laborers than the Wangchang Brigade to deliver fertilizer overnight. If the Wangchang Brigade's lights didn't go out, they wouldn't收兵 (shōubīng) stop. After seven days of突击 (tūjī) rush work, each of the team's 1,000 亩 (mǔ) of spring fields received 300 担 (dān).

    Competitions were also launched among commune members. Tang Jiannan (female), a member of the Fifth Team of the Wangchang Brigade, guarantees to scoop 100 担 (dān) of ditch silt every day. She notified Ge Fengying, a woman from her team, of her plan and requested a mutual visit. After receiving the notification, Ge Fengying went down to the ditch to scoop ditch silt early the next morning.

    Through the mutual visit competition, the preparation for spring plowing has been greatly promoted. 100% of the entire commune's more than 7,000 laborers are attending work, and all of the 18,000 亩 (mǔ) of spring land have been deeply plowed once, and more than 70% has been fertilized, with 200-300 担 (dān) of fertilizer applied per 亩 (mǔ). In addition to applying腊肥 (là féi) pre-spring fertilizer once to the 41,000 亩 (mǔ) of three-wheat fields, half of the fields have now been fertilized again with返青肥 (fǎn qīng féi) fertilizer that stimulates growth after winter, with an average application of 70-80 担 (dān) per 亩 (mǔ).

    广召英雄上门
    江苏省沭阳县青伊湖公社，采用了“组织竞赛，互约参观”的又赛又帮方法，大大推动了备耕工作。
    互约参观的方法有三种：（1）一个大队或一个生产队，下请帖邀请先进单位光临指教；（2）张榜摆擂台，广召英雄上门；（3）自找一个对手或几个对手，讲明条件，约定时间，互相参观。
    由于党委积极发动，群众拥护，互约参观的竞赛很快就开展起来。全公社在最近二十天中，共发出请帖、红榜、互约信八百多件，口头挂钩二千多次。全公社四千二百一十户社员，全部投入竞赛热潮。队队响起了“迎接参观，不断突击”的口号，春耕备种的声势越来越大，工效质量不断提高。
    去年获得玉米高产的王场大队，首先发出“遍请英雄上门来”的邀请书。为了拿出更好更大的成绩给参观人看，发出邀请书的当天，这个大队就发动四百个劳力，调出二十八辆牛车，开展了“百盏灯火夜送肥”的活动，在最近七天，全队就送肥二十万担，八百多亩春田有80％都送上了肥。马场大队是王场大队互约参观的对手，又是邻队，晚间望见王场大队灯笼火把连夜送肥，当晚就召开会议，提出学先进赶先进超先进的口号，立即组织比王场大队更多的劳力连夜送肥。王场大队灯火不熄，他们也不收兵。经过七天突击，全队一千亩春田，每亩都送了三百担。
    在社员之间也开展了竞赛。王场大队第五小队社员唐建南（女），每天保证撩沟淤一百担，她把自己的计划通知本队妇女葛凤英，要求互约参观。葛凤英接到通知后，第二天一早就下沟撩沟淤。
    通过互约参观赛，大大推动了备耕工作。全公社七千多个劳力百分之百出勤，一万八千亩春地，已全部深翻一次，并有70％以上送上肥，每亩施肥二、三百担，一万八千亩春地平均每亩有肥三百担，四万一千亩三麦普追一次腊肥以外，现在又有一半追上返青肥，平均每亩追肥七十到八十担。
