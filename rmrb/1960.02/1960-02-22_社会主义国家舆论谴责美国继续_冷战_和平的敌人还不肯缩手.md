Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 19th: The Soviet newspaper "Izvestia" published a commentator's article today, stating that powerful groups in the West are piling up stones on the road to a summit meeting. The article listed facts to illustrate the malicious attitude of certain Western groups towards international relations, saying that at the end of last year, the U.S. government decided to resume nuclear testing. Following this, the White House declared that it would hand over the secrets of nuclear weapons production to its allies, requesting Congress to change the current laws. Again, the American press is filled with pessimistic tones, apparently to prevent the public from harboring any illusions about the summit meeting to be held in May. The West, instead of promoting progress at the Geneva conference on discontinuing nuclear weapons testing, is causing it to regress.

The article pointed out that after the Soviet Union put forward a proposal for complete and thorough disarmament and decided to unilaterally reduce its armed forces by 1.2 million people, some officials in Washington completely disregarded the spirit of the Soviet Union's peace initiative and the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly.

The article said that it is worth noting that the United States is preparing to supply its "loyal allies" with the secrets of nuclear weapons production. Adenauer is certainly very happy to do so, but what will the German people and the people of other European countries think when they see the former Nazis, today's West German militarists, holding nuclear weapons?

The article continued, these facts prove the malicious attitude of certain Western groups in dealing with international relations. They are either people who profit from arms production or politicians who are completely frozen by the "Cold War." This malicious attitude is naturally not promising, because they ignore the fact that in today's world, the forces of peace have gained an undeniable advantage.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 20th: The Vietnamese newspaper "Nhan Dan" published a commentary today entitled "Enemies of Peace Refuse to Back Down," exposing and condemning the aggressive ambitions revealed by U.S. President Eisenhower in his message to Congress on "Common Security."

The commentary said that Eisenhower's proposal to aid U.S. puppets in Asia so that they can maintain large standing armies "not only exposes the despicable attitude of the U.S. warmongers on the issue of disarmament demanded by people all over the world, but also completely exposes their ambitions to invade Asian countries."

The commentary also condemned Eisenhower for slandering China in his message, and pointed out that the purpose was to cover up the sinister activities of U.S. imperialism in the region. The commentary said that Eisenhower's "special concern" in his message for the territories of Taiwan of the People's Republic of China, South Vietnam of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and South Korea of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as well as his clamor to strengthen military assistance to U.S. puppets in Asia, show that in the current situation, U.S. imperialism, although it has to "chant Amitabha Buddha with its mouth," its belly is still "full of knife points." The commentary said that U.S. military aid and Ngo Dinh Diem's policy of relying on U.S. aid are the main obstacles to the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. Therefore, the Vietnamese people believe that Eisenhower's request to strengthen military aid to South Vietnam is a provocation to the Vietnamese people and is an act resolutely opposed by the Vietnamese people.

The commentary concluded by saying that Eisenhower's request to strengthen military assistance to U.S. puppets in Asia proves that U.S. imperialism is a dangerous enemy of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world. The Vietnamese people and the people of Asia and the world must heighten their vigilance, further strengthen unity and struggle, and force the enemies of peace to lay down their weapons, so that lasting peace for mankind can be guaranteed.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 19th: "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today saying that U.S. President Eisenhower's message to the U.S. Congress on the 1961 fiscal year "Common Security Program" is a "message of aggression and plunder."

The commentary pointed out, after military "aid" greatly increased, "This once again clearly proves that although the U.S. ruling group is now talking about 'peace' and 'disarmament,' it is actually frantically engaged in war preparations and desperately intensifying the arms race."

The commentary said: Eisenhower, in his message, especially pointed the spearhead of aggression at the Far East. The fact that U.S. imperialists so greatly emphasized and strengthened the Lee Seung-man, Chiang Kai-shek, and Ngo Dinh Diem groups proves that U.S. imperialism wants to turn the Far East into a tinderbox for intensifying international tensions.

The commentary said: "U.S. imperialists have recently again brutally trampled on the Korean Armistice Agreement, transporting various new types of heavy weapons such as missiles and ships capable of launching rockets into South Korea. They are also rapidly turning Taiwan and South Vietnam into hotbeds of new war. Eisenhower, while clamoring for 'military aid' to 'allies,' openly described South Korea, Taiwan, South Vietnam, and Laos as 'part of U.S. defense.' All facts prove that U.S. imperialists have carried out planned conspiracies to oppose the people of Asia, including the Korean people."

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, February 20th: The Bulgarian newspaper "Rabotnichesko Delo" published a commentary on the 20th, pointing out that the so-called "foreign aid" plan recently proposed by U.S. President Eisenhower to the U.S. Congress shows that there has been no so-called "peace-loving" change in the policies of the United States and its allies. On the contrary, it "shows their trend: to step up war preparations, establish new military bases, and intensify the arming of NATO member states with atomic and rocket weapons."

The commentary emphasized that certain Western leaders pay lip service to peace while actually preparing for war, while the broad masses of people in various countries resolutely advocate continuing to ease international tensions, reducing rather than increasing military expenditures, and advocate complete and thorough disarmament. The commentary said that the forces of peace will surely prevail over the forces of war.

### 社会主义国家舆论谴责美国继续“冷战”  和平的敌人还不肯缩手

    社会主义国家舆论谴责美国继续“冷战”
    和平的敌人还不肯缩手	苏联“消息报”指出美国竭力为最高级会议制造障碍
    据新华社莫斯科19日电　苏联“消息报”今天发表观察家的评论说，西方的有势力集团正在通向最高级会议的道路上堆积石块。文章列举事实说明西方某些集团对国际关系的恶劣态度说，去年年底，美国政府决定要恢复核试验。接着，白宫声明要将核武器生产的秘密交给它的盟国，要求国会改变现行法律。再次，美国的报刊又充满了悲观论调，这显然是要公众不要对5月间举行的政府首脑会议抱任何幻想。西方在日内瓦不继续试验核武器会议上不是促进会议的进展，而是使之后退。
    文章指出，在苏联提出全面彻底裁军方案并且决定单方面裁军一百二十万人之后，华盛顿一些官员完全不尊重苏联的和平倡议和联合国大会的决议的精神。
    文章说，值得注意的是，美国准备供应它的“忠实盟友”以核武器生产的秘密。阿登纳当然非常高兴这样做，但是，当德国人民和欧洲其他国家人民看到昔日的纳粹、今日的西德军国主义者手中握有核武器时，将有些什么想法呢？
    文章接着说，这些事实证明了西方某些集团在对待国际关系方面所持的恶劣态度。它们或者是从军火生产中获取利润的人，或者是完全被“冷战”冻住了的政客。这种恶劣态度自然是不会有前途的，因为它们忽视了在今天世界上，和平的力量已经取得了无可怀疑的优势。
      越南“人民报”指出美国好战分子侵略亚洲野心毕露
    新华社河内20日电　越南“人民报”今天以“和平的敌人还不肯缩手”为题发表评论，揭露和谴责美国总统艾森豪威尔在向国会提出的“共同安全”咨文中所暴露的侵略野心。
    评论说，艾森豪威尔关于援助美国在亚洲的傀儡使他们能维持人数众多的常备军队的主张，“不但暴露了美国好战分子在全世界人民要求实行裁军的问题上采取的卑劣态度，而且完全暴露了他们侵略亚洲各国的野心。”
    评论还谴责艾森豪威尔在咨文中诬蔑中国，并指出其目的在于掩饰美帝国主义在这个地区的不可告人的阴谋活动。评论说，艾森豪威尔在咨文中对中华人民共和国的领土台湾、越南民主共和国的领土南越和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的领土南朝鲜表示的“特别关心”，以及他要求加强对美国在亚洲的傀儡的军事援助的叫嚣表明了，在当前的局势下，美帝国主义虽然不得不“口念南无阿弥陀佛”，但是肚里还是“满箩刀尖”。评论说，美国的军事援助和吴庭艳依附美援的政策是越南人民和平统一事业的主要障碍。因此，越南人民认为艾森豪威尔要求加强对南越的军事援助是对越南人民的挑衅，是坚决反对越南人民的行为。
    评论最后说，艾森豪威尔关于加强对美国在亚洲的傀儡的军事援助的要求证明，美帝国主义是越南人民和全世界人民的危险敌人。越南人民和亚洲以及全世界人民必须提高警惕，进一步加强团结和斗争，迫使和平的敌人放下武器，使人类的持久和平得到保障。
      朝鲜“劳动新闻”指出美国援外咨文是侵略和掠夺的咨文
    据新华社平壤19日电　“劳动新闻”今天发表评论说，美国总统艾森豪威尔16日在美国国会提出的1961财政年度“共同安全计划”的咨文是“侵略和掠夺的咨文”。
    评论指出军事“援助”大大增加以后说，“这又一次清楚地证明，美国统治集团现在虽然侈谈‘和平’、‘裁军’，实际上是疯狂地进行着战争准备，拼命加剧军备竞赛”。
    评论说：艾森豪威尔在他的咨文中特别把侵略矛头指向远东，美帝国主义者对李承晚、蒋介石、吴庭艳集团那么大加强调，证明美帝国主义是要把远东变成加剧国际紧张局势的喷火口。
    评论说：“美帝国主义者在最近又粗暴地蹂躏了朝鲜停战协定，向南朝鲜运进了导弹和能够发射火箭的舰艇等各种新式重武器。并迅速地把台湾、南越变成新战争的温床。艾森豪威尔在叫嚷对‘盟国’的‘军事援助’时竟公然地把南朝鲜、台湾、南越、老挝说成是‘美国国防的一部分’。一切事实证明，美帝国主义者为了反对包括朝鲜人民在内的亚洲人民进行了有计划的阴谋活动”。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”指出美国仍在扩军备战加强军事集团
    据新华社索非亚20日电　保加利亚“工人事业报”20日发表评论指出，美国总统艾森豪威尔最近向美国国会提出的所谓“援外”计划，说明美国及其盟国政策不但没有发生所谓“爱好和平”的变化，恰恰相反，“表明了它们的这种趋向：加紧备战，建立新的军事基地，加紧用原子武器和火箭武器武装北大西洋公约组织的成员国”。
    评论强调指出，某些西方首脑人士口头上空谈和平，实际上准备战争，而各国广大的人民群众坚决主张继续缓和国际紧张局势，削减而不是增加军事支出，主张彻底和全面裁军。评论说，和平力量必将战胜战争势力。
