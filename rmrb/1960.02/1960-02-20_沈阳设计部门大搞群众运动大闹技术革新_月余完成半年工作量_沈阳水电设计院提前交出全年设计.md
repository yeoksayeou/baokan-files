Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 19th: Shenyang City's six design institutes are vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, completing design tasks at high speed.

These are the Shenyang Hydropower Design Institute, Shenyang Aluminum and Magnesium Design and Research Institute, Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute, the Eighth Design Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building, Liaoning Provincial Design Institute, and Northeast Industrial Design Institute. To date, the amount of design work they have completed this year has increased by 6.25 times to 130 times compared to the fourth quarter of last year; labor productivity has increased by four times to 129 times compared to last year. According to statistics from five of these design institutes, 349 design projects originally planned to be completed in the second half of the year have been completed ahead of schedule, with all design quality reaching excellent, and saving a large amount of funds and building materials for the designed projects.

This year, these design units continued to adhere to putting politics in command, extensively and deeply mobilizing the masses, and vigorously reforming design procedures and methods. All units have universally applied the "Six News" (new structure, new technology, new equipment, new style, new materials, new theory) and "Tenizations" (design standardization, calculation tabulation, drawing equipmentization, tool advancement, drawing versatility, tracing stampization, design movable type, common data manualization, design work parallelization, drawing integration) of design work, while strengthening scientific and technological research work. The Shenyang Aluminum and Magnesium Design and Research Institute successfully created a short-circuit current computer, increasing work efficiency by 140 times. It only takes ten minutes to design a 50,000-ton short-circuit circuit with this machine; while in the past it took three days. The Northeast Design Institute widely adopted wax paper movable type design, completing the design of a 5,000-square-meter mechanical processing workshop in only fifteen minutes, increasing efficiency by more than 1,800 times.

Ranking engineering tasks according to their importance and urgency, determining key points, and concentrating superior forces to carry out concentrated assaults in batches is an important method for these design units to carry out high-speed design. For example, when the Shenyang Aluminum and Magnesium Design and Research Institute completed the first and second batches of design tasks, it first decided to attack 15 key projects, clarify goals, and concentrate its main forces to fight "wars of annihilation." As a result, fourteen engineering program problems were solved in one day. While attacking key projects, a contract system was adopted for fragmented projects, using a small number of forces to carry out cleaning and finishing work. The application of this method has fully mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, making the movement interlocked and surging higher and higher.

These design units also paid special attention to the matching of advanced experience. Through exhibitions, appraisals, matching, and promotion, they compiled more than 11,000 sets of large, medium, and small design experiences accumulated in various types of design over the years. These complete sets of experiences have now been incorporated into technical regulations, which have played a significant role in improving labor productivity.

According to Shenyang Daily, the six design institutes in Shenyang City have completely changed the situation of design lagging behind construction, making design work far ahead of construction. Now, the Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute, Shenyang Aluminum and Magnesium Design and Research Institute, Liaoning Provincial Design Institute, the Eighth Design Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building, and Northeast Industrial Design Institute have overfulfilled their design workload for the first half of this year by 4.5% to 12% respectively. The Shenyang Hydropower Design Institute took the lead, completing its design tasks for the entire year 329 days ahead of schedule, exceeding the target by 3.1%, and submitted the design ahead of schedule on February 5th.

    沈阳设计部门大搞群众运动大闹技术革新
    月余完成半年工作量
    沈阳水电设计院提前交出全年设计
    新华社沈阳19日电　沈阳市六个设计院大搞技术革新和技术革命，高速度地完成设计任务。
    它们是沈阳水电设计院、沈阳铝镁设计研究院、沈阳煤矿设计院、第一机械工业部第八设计院、辽宁省设计院、东北工业设计院。到目前为止，今年他们完成的设计工作量已分别比去年第四季度提高六点二五倍到一百三十倍；劳动生产率分别比去年增长四倍到一百二十九倍。据其中五个设计院的统计，原计划到下半年完成的三百四十九个设计项目已经提前完成，设计质量全部达到优良，并且为设计的工程节约了大量资金和建筑材料。
    这些设计单位今年继续坚持政治挂帅，广泛深入发动群众，大力改革设计程序和设计方法。各单位普遍运用了设计工作的“六新”（新结构、新工艺、新设备、新风格、新材料、新理论）和“十化”（设计定型化、计算表格化、制图装备化、工具先进化、图纸万能化、描图图戳化、设计活版化、常用资料手册化、设计作业平行化、图纸综合化），同时加强科学技术研究工作。沈阳铝镁设计研究院创造成功一台短路电流计算机，提高工作效率一百四十倍。用这台机器做一个五万吨的短路电路设计，只需十分钟；而过去却要三天的时间。东北设计院广泛采用腊纸活版设计，只用十五分钟就完成了五千平方米的机械加工车间的设计，提高效率一千八百多倍。
    根据工程任务轻重缓急进行排队，确定重点，集中优势力量分片分批突击，是这些设计单位进行高速度设计的重要方法。例如沈阳铝镁设计研究院在完成第一、二批设计任务时，首先决定突击十五个重点项目，明确目标，集中主要力量打“歼灭战”。结果在一天内就解决了十四项工程方案问题。在突击重点工程的同时，对零碎工程则采取分片包干的办法，用少数力量进行扫清、结尾工作。运用这种方法，充分发挥了群众的积极性和创造性，使运动一环套一环，一浪高一浪。
    这些设计单位还特别注意先进经验配套。他们通过展览、鉴定、配套、推广，将几年来在各种类型的设计中积累起来的新经验、新技术、新方法，配成大中小设计经验一万一千多套。现在这些成套经验已经纳入技术规程，对提高劳动生产率起了很大作用。
    据沈阳日报消息　沈阳市六个设计院彻底改变了设计落后于施工的局面，使设计工作远远走在施工前头。现在，沈阳煤矿设计院、沈阳铝镁设计研究院、辽宁省设计院、第一机械工业部第八设计院、东北工业设计院已经分别超额4．5％到12％，提前完成了今年上半年的设计工作量。沈阳水电设计院更是一马当先，于2月5日提前三百二十九天超额3．1％，完成了今年全年的设计任务，提前交出了设计。
