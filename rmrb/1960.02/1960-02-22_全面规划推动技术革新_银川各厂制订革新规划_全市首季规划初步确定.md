    Comprehensive Planning Promotes Technological Innovation
    Yinchuan Factories Formulate Innovation Plans; City's First Quarter Plan Initially Determined
    According to the *Ningxia Daily* news, in order to meet the needs of production development and carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in a guided and planned manner, factories in Yinchuan City have generally formulated technical innovation and technical revolution plans for the first quarter of this year. On this basis, the relevant leaders in Yinchuan City have initially formulated the city's technical innovation and technical revolution plan for the first quarter.
    In the new year, the contradiction between production tasks and insufficient technical equipment is even more prominent in factories. Workers with heavy labor intensity, such as forging workers, foundry workers, and carpenters, are also eager to achieve semi-mechanization and mechanization. The broad masses of workers are breaking superstitions, daring to think and act, and both experienced masters and apprentices are vying to put forward technical innovation proposals, which urgently need to be researched and identified in a timely manner, and implemented in a planned manner. Under this situation, the technical innovation committees of various factories in Yinchuan City, under the direct leadership of the Party organizations of their respective factories, promptly studied the suggestions of the masses according to the requirements of the higher authorities, and formulated the technical innovation and technical revolution plans for the first quarter of their factories according to the needs of production and the subjective and objective conditions, distinguishing the primary and secondary priorities and urgency. The city has initially decided to carry out more than 200 major innovation projects in the first quarter. In terms of casting and forging, there are the manufacturing of foundry cranes, the promotion of advanced experience in mud mold casting, and the manufacturing of splint hammers; in terms of riveting and welding, there are the manufacturing of riveting tools, iron cutting machines, native welding rods, and water resistance welding machines; in terms of carpentry, there are the manufacturing of large band saws and automatic planers.
    Whether it is the factory's plan or the city's plan, they all have the following characteristics: combining the transformation of old equipment with the creation of new advanced tools; with the transformation of old equipment as the main focus; combining major technological innovations with minor technological innovations, and combining foreign methods with local methods.
    In the process of formulating the plan, each factory vigorously mobilized the masses to put forward innovation proposals, and then classified and ranked them, adopting the "five-determination" method of determining the project, determining the personnel, determining the time, determining the measures, and determining the inspection, so that the plan is implemented. After mobilizing the masses to put forward suggestions, the tire repair factory drew up a plan for the first half of the year, striving to achieve semi-mechanization of processing and repair, and self-sufficiency in spare parts. At the beginning of January, Yang Huanzhang, an old worker at the Small Hardware Factory, proposed manufacturing an electric nut punch. The factory's technical innovation committee invited him to participate in the meeting. After his explanation, this proposal was included in the factory's technical innovation and technical revolution plan, and the factory designated three old workers and two apprentices to help him with the trial production, which was successfully manufactured in mid-January, and can improve efficiency six times.
    At present, factories in Yinchuan City are continuing to enrich the plan in conjunction with the city's technical innovation experience exchange meeting; and mobilizing the masses to carry out communist collaboration and actively implement the plan. (Attached picture)

    全面规划推动技术革新
    银川各厂制订革新规划　全市首季规划初步确定
    据宁夏日报消息　为了适应生产发展的需要，有领导、有计划地开展技术革新和技术革命运动，银川市各工厂今年普遍制订了第一季度技术革新和技术革命规划。在这个基础上，银川市有关领导方面已经初步制订了全市的第一季度技术革新和技术革命规划。
    在新的一年里，生产任务和技术设备不足之间的矛盾，在各工厂更显得突出。锻工、铸工、木工等劳动强度较重的工人也迫切希望实现半机械化、机械化。广大职工破除迷信，敢想敢干，无论是老师傅还是学徒工，都争先提出技术革新建议，这些技术革新建议急需及时研究鉴定，有计划地实现。在这种情况下，银川市各工厂的技术革新委员会根据上级要求，在本厂党组织直接领导下，及时研究了群众的建议，按照生产的需要和主客观条件，分清主次缓急，制订了本厂的首季技术革新和技术革命规划。全市初步决定在首季进行的主要革新项目共二百多项。在铸锻方面，有制造铸工行车、推广泥型铸造的先进经验、制造夹板锤等；在铆焊方面，有制造铆装工具、切铁机、土焊条、水阻电焊机等；在木工方面，有制造大型皮带锯、自动刨床等。
    无论是工厂的规划还是全市的规划，都具有下列特点：改造旧的设备和创造新的先进工具相结合；而以改造旧的设备为主；大的技术革新和小的技术革新相结合，洋的和土的相结合。
    在制订规划的过程中，各厂大力发动群众提革新建议，然后进行分类排队，采取定项目、定人员、定时间、定措施、定检查的“五定”办法，使规划落实。车胎修理厂经过发动群众提建议，订出了上半年的规划，力争实现加工、修理半机械化，修配零件自给自足。元月初，小五金厂老工人杨焕章提出了制造电动螺母冲床的建议，厂的技术革新委员会就邀请他参加会议。经他讲解说明，这项建议列入了本厂技术革新和技术革命规划，厂里并指定三名老工人、两名学徒帮助他进行试制，已在元月中旬制造成功，可以提高效率六倍。
    目前，银川市各工厂正在结合全市技术革新经验交流会，继续充实规划；并且发动群众，开展共产主义大协作，积极实现规划。（附图片）
