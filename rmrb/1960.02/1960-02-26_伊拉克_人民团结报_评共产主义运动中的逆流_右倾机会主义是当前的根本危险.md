Iraqi "People's Unity Newspaper" Comments on Countercurrents in the Communist Movement
Right-wing Opportunism is the Fundamental Danger at Present

    This dispatch: The Iraqi "People's Unity Newspaper" published a commentary on January 25 entitled "The Fundamental Danger to the Communist Party at Home and Abroad is Right-wing Opportunism."

    The commentary begins by saying that in recent years, a very important political and ideological document in the communist movement—the declaration of the meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries held in Moscow in November 1957—stated: "Under the current conditions, the main danger is revisionism, or right-wing opportunism." Such phrases have also appeared in the resolutions and statements of the Communist Parties of various countries and in the expanded meeting of the Central Committee of our Party in September 1958.

    The danger of revisionism and right-wing opportunism became more obvious after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. After the exposure of Comrade Stalin's sectarian and dogmatic errors in his leadership in recent years, a negative effect was produced among some ideologically and politically weak strata in the communist movement. This was manifested in their using the pretext of opposing "Stalinism" to obliterate and distort the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism.

    The commentary said that the reactionaries of the world and their lackeys, various opportunists (who gathered under the right-wing opportunist leaders of various countries and the Yugoslav revisionist group), greatly exploited this reaction in a desperate attempt to undermine the socialist system, to revive fascism in Eastern European countries, and to split the unity between the Communist Parties of capitalist countries. The consequences of these activities were the reactionary armed events in Hungary in 1956 and the splittist activities within Western Communist Parties.

    In Iraq, opportunism appeared in the earliest days of the revolution. They were a small group of weak, dying revanchists.

    Recently, opportunism has appeared in a "new" form, damaging the Party's reputation and its glorious history, slandering its revolutionary policies, its leaders and cadres, inciting the authorities against it, and deepening the divisions between national forces. The new opportunist movement is borrowing many methods and political and ideological foundations from world modern revisionism. However, these tricks are all well known.

    The commentary pointed out that most of the attacks by the revisionists are directed against the leaders of other Communist Parties, slandering them with well-known adjectives such as "dogmatic" and "stubborn." They deliberately do this to cover up the fact that these Communist Parties have achieved great achievements due to their Marxist-Leninist policies and leadership. Dogmatic errors are only secondary matters compared to these great achievements.

    The commentary said that despite Stalin's serious mistakes, the socialist construction of the Soviet Union and the socialist movement in the world achieved historic victories during the Stalin era, and even when he made mistakes, it was entirely out of his boundless loyalty to the people and the revolutionary cause. The commentary said when mentioning leaders like Stalin: Can it be imagined—even for a moment—to equate any of them with Kautsky, Trotsky, Imre Nagy, and others? This is not possible, because these leaders who made dogmatic errors generally still maintained the Leninist line. Moreover, Marxism-Leninism was still the battle flag held high in their hands. Some errors were dealt with at the time in a spirit of self-criticism on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, rather than on the basis of splittism and opportunism as the current opportunists are doing.

    The commentary emphasized that the banner of Marxism-Leninism still guides the activities of the Iraqi Communist Party, and the banner of Marxism-Leninism has never fallen in the Iraqi working class's struggle against imperialism, against reactionaries, and against bourgeois forces.

    The opportunists of the world and the opportunists of our country are colluding in such activities as trying to uglify the reputation of the Communist Party, in revising the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism and its revolutionary essence under the name of "Marxism-Leninism," and in belittling the significance of the Party's revolutionary leadership and policies.

    Not only that, the opportunists of the world even say that the mistakes of Stalin and other Communist Party leaders are the entire source of all the ugly and evil deeds in the world! These mistakes "caused international tension," "the danger of war," and so on. As for world imperialism, the reactionaries of the world, and their open or secret lackeys, they do not have to be responsible for these mistakes. Because they were only "provoked by Stalinist policies"!

    The commentary pointed out that opportunists sometimes also mention imperialism and reactionaries. But even at this time, they still frantically and stubbornly repeat "the mistakes of the Communist Party." If we want to simply count the statements they direct against imperialism and reactionaries from the opportunist "press's" pile of abuse against Communist Party leaders, we would not even see them, let alone find their exposures of the conspiracies and evil activities of imperialism and reactionaries.

    The opportunists of the world want to "spread liberalism" in the Communist Parties of various countries, calling for the Party to be rescued from the organizational "rigidity" and "suppression" of "Stalinism." This is exactly what the opportunists are using these excuses to create another weak and powerless leadership center within the Party, splitting the Party's unity. Not only that, they also "attach conditions," demanding that the Party's Politburo step down, completely disregarding and violating the Party's system, the Party's organs, and the wishes of the masses, as well as the Party's most sacred Leninist organizational principles.

    The commentary emphasized that the opportunists of the world hope that the Communist Party will follow behind things, not work hard to lead the masses, so in Yugoslavia they put forward the "spontaneous" economic laws without guidance and supervision, so that the achievements of socialism are shattered one by one. Unemployment has reappeared, and the living standards of the working people are declining. The opportunists here also attack the Communist Party because the Communist Party resolutely opposes conspiracy activities and strives to mobilize and liberate the masses in order to defend the Republic. The opportunists are not satisfied with the Party's criticism of the bourgeoisie, even though they know that doing so is a brutal violation of Mao Zedong's famous principle: unity and criticism with the national bourgeoisie. (The opportunists) hope that the Party will not point out the mistakes of the national bourgeoisie, nor stand on an independent position determined by its special class existence, in order to "not destroy the unity of the ranks"!

    The new trend of Iraqi opportunism is a "local" form of modern revisionism. Therefore, it quickly fell into the trap set by imperialism and domestic reactionary forces, and relied on their support.

### 伊拉克“人民团结报”评共产主义运动中的逆流  右倾机会主义是当前的根本危险

    伊拉克“人民团结报”评共产主义运动中的逆流
    右倾机会主义是当前的根本危险
    本报讯　伊拉克“人民团结报”1月25日发表了一篇题为“共产党在本国和世界上的根本危险是右倾机会主义”的评论。
    评论首先说，近几年来，共产主义运动中一个很重要的政治和思想文献——1957年11月聚会于莫斯科的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言曾说道：“在目前条件下，主要的危险是修正主义，或者说右倾机会主义”。此后在各国共产党以及我们党1958年9月中央扩大会议的全部决议和声明中也都出现了这样的字句。
    修正主义和右倾机会主义的危险在苏共第二十次代表大会之后更加明显了。在揭露斯大林同志近年来在领导中所犯的宗派主义和教条主义错误之后，在共产主义运动中一些意识形态和政治软弱的阶层中产生了消极的作用。这表现在他们以反对“斯大林主义”为借口来抹煞和歪曲马克思列宁主义的根本原则。
    评论说，世界上的反动派及其走狗各种机会主义者（他们聚集在各国右倾机会主义领导和南斯拉夫修正主义集团里）大大地利用了这种反应，企图绝望地破坏社会主义制度，企图在东欧各国复活法西斯主义，企图分裂资本主义各国共产党之间的团结关系。这些活动的后果就是1956年在匈牙利发生的反动武装事件，以及西方共产党内部的分裂主义活动。
    在伊拉克，在革命的最初日子里就出现了机会主义，他们是一小撮虚弱的垂死的复仇主义分子。
    近来，机会主义又以“新”的形式出现了，他们破坏党的名誉和它的光荣历史，诽谤它的革命政策、它的领导和干部，怂恿当局反对它，加深民族力量之间的分歧。新的机会主义运动正从世界现代修正主义那里借用许多手法和政治、思想基础。然而这些伎俩又都是为大家所熟知的。
    评论指出，修正主义者绝大部分的攻击针对别国共产党的领导，用“教条”“顽固”等大家熟知了的形容词诬蔑他们。他们故意以此来掩盖这些共产党由于它们的马克思列宁主义政策和领导而取得伟大功绩的事实。教条主义的错误同这些伟大功绩比较起来，只是居于第二位的事情。
    评论说，尽管斯大林犯了严重的错误。在斯大林时代里，苏联的社会主义建设与世界上的社会主义运动都取得了历史性的胜利，甚至在他犯错误的时候也完全是出于他对人民和革命事业的无限忠诚。评论在提到像斯大林这样一些领导人的时候说：难道可以想像——即使是一瞬间也好——把他们中的任何一个人同考茨基、托洛茨基、伊姆雷·纳吉等人同等看待吗？这不能，因为这些犯了教条主义错误的领导人，一般地讲他们仍然维护了列宁主义路线。而且，马克思列宁主义仍是他们手里高举着的战斗旗帜。一些错误，当时就在马克思列宁主义基础上以自我批评的精神作了处理，而不是在分裂主义和机会主义的基础上像目前机会主义分子所做的那样。
    评论强调指出，马克思列宁主义的旗帜仍然指导着伊拉克共产党的活动，马克思列宁主义的旗帜在伊拉克工人阶级反对帝国主义、反对反动派和资产阶级势力的斗争中一刻也没有倒下。
    世界上的机会主义者和我国的机会主义者就是这样的在试图丑化共产党的声誉、在“马克思列宁主义”名义下修正马克思列宁主义的根本原则及其革命本质的活动中，在贬低党的革命领导和政策的意义的活动中同流合污了。
    不仅如此，世界上的机会主义者竟把斯大林和其他共产党领导的错误说成是世界上一切丑事恶事的全部根源！这些错误“造成了国际紧张局势”、“战争危险”等等。至于世界帝国主义、世界上的反动派及其公开或秘密的走狗们却不必对这些错误负责。因为他们只是“被斯大林主义政策挑起的”！
    评论指出，机会主义者有时也提到帝国主义和反动派。但就在这时候他们也仍然疯狂而顽固地重复着“共产党的错误”。假如我们想从机会主义“报刊”对共产党领导的大堆恶骂中去简单地统计一下它们针对帝国主义和反动派而发的语句，我们会看都看不见，更谈不上去找它们对帝国主义和反动派的阴谋与罪恶活动的揭露了。
    世界上的机会主义者要在各国共产党内“散布自由主义”，号召把党从“斯大林主义”的组织“僵化”和“压制”中拯救出来。这也正是机会主义者们用这些借口在党内制造另一个软弱无力的领导中心，分裂党的团结。不但如此，他们还“附有条件”，要党的政治局下台，完全无视和侵犯党的制度、党的机关和群众的意愿以及党的最神圣的列宁主义组织原则。
    评论着重说，世界上的机会主义者希望共产党尾随在事物的后面，不要努力地去领导群众，所以在南斯拉夫他们就提出了不受指导与监督的“自发的”经济法则。以致使社会主义成果一个个地破灭了。失业又重新出现，劳动人民生活水平在下降。我们这里的机会主义也攻击共产党，因为共产党坚决反对阴谋活动和为保卫共和国而努力动员和解放群众。机会主义者还不满意党对资产阶级进行批评，尽管他们知道这样做是粗暴地破坏了毛泽东的著名原则：同民族资产阶级是又团结又批评。（机会主义者）希望党不要指出民族资产阶级的错误，也不要站在由其特殊的阶级存在所决定的独立立场上，以求“不要破坏队伍的团结”！
    伊拉克机会主义的新潮流是现代修正主义的一个“地方”形式。因此，它也很快地陷入了帝国主义和国内反动力量布下的罗网，并且依靠了他们的支持。
