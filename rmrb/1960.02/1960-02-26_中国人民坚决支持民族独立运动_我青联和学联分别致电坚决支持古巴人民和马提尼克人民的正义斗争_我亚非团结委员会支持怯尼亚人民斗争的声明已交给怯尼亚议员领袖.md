Xinhua News Agency, February 25th. The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation, today sent telegrams to the July 26th Movement Student Department of the Cuban Socialist Youth League, and the Cuban University Students Federation, expressing extreme indignation at the crimes of American planes continuously bombing Cuba.

The telegram stated: "The Chinese youth and students express extreme indignation at the crimes of American planes continuously bombing Cuba in open aggression, and resolutely support the just struggle of the Cuban people, youth and students to safeguard national independence and oppose the interference and aggression of U.S. imperialism."

The telegram pointed out: "While the U.S. government is forced to apologize to the Cuban government, it continues to bomb Cuba and intensify its criminal activities of interfering in Cuba in various ways. A jackal is always a jackal. Imperialism is bullying the weak and fearing the strong, and full of tricks. As long as the people strengthen their unity, heighten their vigilance, and constantly expose and smash the conspiracies of imperialism, then imperialist aggression is bound to fail, and the people's cause is bound to triumph."

The telegram stated: "Chinese youth and students will always stand on the side of the Cuban and Latin American youth and students, and fight together against imperialism and for the defense of peace. We firmly believe that with the firm support of the people of Latin America and the world, the united and resolute struggle of the Cuban people, youth and students will surely defeat the aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism and achieve a great victory."

Xinhua News Agency, February 25th. The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation, today sent telegrams to the youth and students of Martinique, expressing firm support for Martinique's national liberation and opposition to the convening of the French colonial rule conference.

The telegram stated: "We are pleased to learn that you are holding a conference on February 24th to strive for Martinique's national liberation and oppose French colonial rule. We hereby express our firm support to you on behalf of all Chinese youth and students."

The telegram pointed out: "In order to maintain the colonial system and carry out a desperate struggle, French imperialism is intensifying its suppression and persecution of the Martinique people, which can only further arouse the liberation struggle of the Martinique people. The twentieth century is an era in which oppressed nations gain liberation and colonialism moves towards death. We firmly believe that as long as the Martinique youth and students unite with the people and resolutely carry out the struggle against imperialism and for liberation, the final victory will surely belong to you!"

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 24th. Zhu Ziqi, Secretary-General of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, tonight handed over a statement from the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity supporting the Kenyan people's struggle for national independence and demanding the release of Jomo Kenyatta to Oginga Odinga, Chairman of the Kenyan "African Members Organization."

This statement was issued when the Chinese people held "Kenya Day" and "Jomo Kenyatta Day" on September 25th last year. Jomo Kenyatta is the leader of the Kenyan nationalist movement who was unreasonably arrested by the British colonial authorities. After receiving the statement, Odinga expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people and raised his arm and shouted: "Freedom," "Freedom."

Odinga arrived here in London today from London after attending the Kenyan Constitutional Roundtable Conference. He is scheduled to leave here on the 25th for Nairobi, the capital of Kenya.

    我青联和学联分别致电坚决支持古巴人民和马提尼克人民的正义斗争
    我亚非团结委员会支持怯尼亚人民斗争的声明已交给怯尼亚议员领袖
    新华社25日讯　中华全国青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会，今天打电报给古巴社会主义青年联盟7月26日运动学生部、古巴大学生联合会，对美国飞机连续轰炸古巴的罪行表示极大的愤慨。
    电报说：“中国青年和学生对美国飞机连续轰炸古巴进行公开侵略的罪行表示极大的愤慨，并坚决支持古巴人民、青年和学生维护民族独立、反对美帝国主义的干涉和侵略的正义斗争。”
    电报指出：“美国政府一面被迫向古巴政府道歉，一面却继续对古巴进行轰炸和从各方面加紧进行干涉古巴的罪恶活动。豺狼总是豺狼。帝国主义是欺软怕硬、诡计多端的，只要人民加强团结，提高警惕，不断揭露和粉碎帝国主义的阴谋诡计，那末帝国主义的侵略一定失败，人民的事业一定胜利。”
    电报说：“中国青年和学生永远站在古巴和拉丁美洲青年和学生一边，为反对帝国主义、保卫和平而共同奋斗。我们深信，在拉丁美洲和全世界人民的坚决支持下，古巴人民、青年和学生团结一致、坚决斗争的力量，一定能够击败美帝国主义的侵略活动而取得伟大的胜利。”
    新华社25日讯　中华全国青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会，今天打电报给马提尼克青年和学生，表示坚决支持马提尼克民族解放，反对法国殖民统治大会的召开。
    电报说：“欣悉你们在2月24日举行争取马提尼克民族解放、反对法国殖民统治的大会，谨代表全中国青年和学生向你们表示坚决的支持。”
    电报指出：“法国帝国主义为了维护殖民制度、进行绝望挣扎，加紧对马提尼克人民的镇压和迫害，这只能进一步激起马提尼克人民的解放斗争。二十世纪是被压迫民族获得解放和殖民主义走向死亡的时代。我们深信，只要马提尼克青年和学生同人民一道，团结一致，坚决进行反对帝国主义、争取解放的斗争，最后胜利一定属于你们！”
    新华社开罗24日电　中国亚非团结委员会秘书长朱子奇今天晚上在这里把中国亚非团结委员会关于支持怯尼亚人民争取民族独立的斗争和要求释放乔莫·肯雅塔的一个声明，交给了怯尼亚“非洲议员组织”的主席奥金加·奥廷加。
    这个声明是在中国人民去年9月25日举行“怯尼亚日”和“乔莫·肯雅塔日”时发表的。乔莫·肯雅塔是遭英国殖民当局无理逮捕的怯尼亚民族主义运动领袖。奥廷加在收到这个声明后，对中国人民表示感谢，并且举臂高呼：“自由”，“自由”。
    奥廷加是在伦敦参加怯尼亚宪法圆桌会议后，今天从伦敦来到这里的。他定于25日离开这里前往怯尼亚首都内罗华。
