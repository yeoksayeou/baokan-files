After two years of continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, the call to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, has been victoriously realized. This is a major event of great historical significance in the history of socialist construction in our country. The early completion of the Second Five-Year Plan proves that the Party's general line for socialist construction is completely correct, the development speed of the Great Leap Forward is entirely possible, and the organizational form of the People's Commune has infinite and powerful vitality. Because we completed five years of tasks in two years, this greatly accelerated the process of socialist construction in our country, strengthened the foundation of our country's industrialization, opened up the road for high-speed development of our country's agriculture, and laid a foundation for a sustained Great Leap Forward in our country's socialist construction in the years to come, both politically, ideologically, and materially.

The early completion of the Second Five-Year Plan has further strengthened the strength of the socialist camp and powerfully encouraged the confidence and determination of all underdeveloped countries to get rid of imperialist bondage and develop their national economies, once again demonstrating the incomparable superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. Therefore, the completion of the Second Five-Year Plan has great historical significance not only in our country but also internationally. With the most vivid facts, it once again proved the brilliant thesis put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong that the East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind.

In terms of the output of major products, the distance between our country and the United Kingdom has been greatly shortened.

Our country's Second Five-Year Plan was proposed at the Eighth National Congress of the Party in September 1956 and approved by the State Council in February 1957. According to the original plan, by 1962, the total value of industrial and agricultural output should increase by about 75% compared with 1957, of which the total value of industrial output should increase by about 100% compared with 1957, and the total value of agricultural output should increase by about 35% compared with 1957. As a result of the actual implementation, the total value of industrial and agricultural output in 1959 increased by 94.4% compared with 1957, of which the total value of industrial output increased by 1.315 times compared with 1957, and the total value of agricultural output increased by 45.8% compared with 1957. Based on the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production, our country's national income increased by 62.86%, while the original plan was to increase by about 50%. The early completion of the Second Five-Year Plan in terms of the total value of industrial and agricultural output and national income shows that in terms of the overall development level of social production, the goals originally intended to be achieved in five years have now been achieved in only two years.

In terms of the output of major products, the Second Five-Year Plan originally stipulated twenty-four production targets. According to preliminary statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, in 1959, thirteen products, namely steel, coal, electricity generation, metallurgical equipment, power generation equipment, metal cutting machine tools, timber, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, salt, machine-made paper, grain, and cotton, have reached and exceeded the original production targets; among the eleven products that have not reached the original targets, cement and soybeans have approached the original targets, and although the other products have not reached the original targets, their growth rate has greatly exceeded the original plan. For example, according to the original plan: the average growth rate of crude oil was 20% to 24.4%, while the actual rate for the past two years was 59.3%; the average growth rate of aluminum ingots was 38% to 43.1%, while the actual rate for the past two years was 55.8%; the average growth rate of chemical fertilizers was 39% to 40.8%, while the actual rate for the past two years was 45.3%. It can be seen that the completion of some production indicators that are decisive for the development of the national economy is very good.

The early completion of the Second Five-Year Plan has not only greatly shortened the distance between our country and the United Kingdom in terms of the output of major products, but some products have also exceeded the production level of the United Kingdom. In 1957, the year when the Party Central Committee put forward the slogan of catching up with the United Kingdom in terms of the output of major industrial products in about fifteen years, the United Kingdom produced 22.04 million tons of steel, 14.55 million tons of pig iron, and 227.22 million tons of coal, while our country only produced 5.35 million tons of steel, 5.936 million tons of pig iron, and 130 million tons of coal that year. That is to say, our country's steel output was only 24.3% of the United Kingdom's, pig iron output was only 40.8% of the United Kingdom's, and coal output was only 57.2% of the United Kingdom's. After only two years, our country's steel output has increased to 13.35 million tons, pig iron output has increased to 20.5 million tons, and raw coal output has increased to 347.8 million tons, while the United Kingdom, after the economic crisis in 1958, saw its steel output drop to 20.2 million tons in 1959, pig iron output drop to 12.6 million tons, and coal output drop to 206 million tons. That is to say, our country's steel output has increased from 24.3% of the United Kingdom's steel output in 1957 to 66% in 1959, while the output of pig iron and raw coal has left this old-fashioned imperialist country far behind. Admittedly, there are still some major products whose output has not yet caught up with the United Kingdom, but the development trend in the past two years can already be seen very clearly: the time to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in terms of the output of major products will definitely be faster than originally envisioned. Two years, which is just a blink of an eye in human history, but our country has achieved such great achievements in such a short period of time. Isn't this new and powerful evidence that socialism is like the rising sun and imperialism is declining?

The most basic proportional relationships in our national economy are more coordinated.

The high-speed development of the national economy is a common law of all socialist countries, and it is also a common law of our country's First Five-Year Plan and Second Five-Year Plan. However, the high speed of the First Five-Year Plan was only a general high speed, not, and could not be, a Great Leap Forward high speed. This is not only because during the First Five-Year Plan period, our country's industrial foundation was still very weak and the material conditions needed for the Great Leap Forward were not sufficient, but more importantly, because during most of the First Five-Year Plan period, our country was still in the conditions of socialist transformation, and the task of socialist revolution had not yet been completed, which could not but affect the productive enthusiasm of the people. By 1956, due to the basic completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, especially after the anti-Rightist struggle in 1957, our country's socialist revolution achieved a decisive victory not only on the economic front but also on the political and ideological fronts, and the productive enthusiasm of the people was fully brought into play. Under such conditions, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong promptly put forward the general line for socialist construction, which created two consecutive years of Great Leap Forward. It can be seen that the appearance of the high speed of the Great Leap Forward, especially the high speed of sustained leap forward, in our country's socialist construction is inseparable from the formulation and implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction. The general line is the most fundamental driving force of the Great Leap Forward. The early completion of the Second Five-Year Plan makes the brilliance of the general line even more brilliant and the thinking of the general line more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, thereby laying a foundation for a sustained leap forward in our country's socialist construction in the future years politically and ideologically.

The early completion of the Second Five-Year Plan is also a victory for the path of industrialization in our country as instructed by Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "...The issue of the path of industrialization mainly refers to the issue of the development relationship between heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture. Our country's economic construction is centered on heavy industry, and this must be affirmed. However, at the same time, we must pay full attention to the development of agriculture and light industry." In the past two years, our country's socialist construction has been advancing along the path instructed by Comrade Mao Zedong. The two years of continuous Great Leap Forward have significantly strengthened the material and technological foundation of our country's industrialization. This strengthening is not only reflected in the rapid growth of heavy industrial products, but also in the further improvement of the development ratio of industry and agriculture and the development ratio of light and heavy industry.

In terms of the development of heavy industry, under the principle of "taking steel as the key link and comprehensively leaping forward," almost all heavy industrial products have increased by more than doubled in the past two years. For example, steel has increased by 1.5 times, pig iron has increased by 2.45 times, raw coal has increased by 1.68 times, electricity generation has increased by 1.15 times, crude oil has increased by 1.54 times, metal cutting machine tools have increased by 1.5 times, and chemical fertilizers have increased by 1.1 times, etc. The rapid development of our country's heavy industry is not only reflected in the quantitative growth but also in the qualitative improvement. Now, our country's machinery industry has been able to produce heavy machinery such as 1,513 cubic meter blast furnaces and 2,500-ton hydraulic presses, and can produce thermal power generating equipment with a capacity of 50,000 kilowatts and hydropower generating equipment with a capacity of 72,500 kilowatts. Automobiles, airplanes, tractors, and high-efficiency steam locomotives have all been produced in batches. The variety of steel produced by our country's steel industry has reached more than 6,000 types. The self-sufficiency rate of machinery and equipment and steel, the two most important means of production, has now reached more than 80%. This rapid development of our country's heavy industry has greatly strengthened the material foundation for expanded reproduction and strengthened the material foundation for the technological transformation of the national economy, especially agriculture. According to statistics, with the Great Leap Forward of heavy industry, the state has supplied more steel to agriculture in the past two years than the total of the first five years. Since the Great Leap Forward, the state's supply of drainage and irrigation machinery, tractors, combine harvesters, and trucks to agriculture has also greatly exceeded the total of the first five years. And in the future, under the conditions that the foundation of industrialization has been strengthened and will continue to be strengthened, we will be able to promote the technological transformation of the national economy, especially agriculture, faster and better, so that our country's agriculture can be established on the basis of modern technology more quickly and the agricultural labor productivity can be increased more quickly.

In terms of the development relationship between heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture, under the Party's principle of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously and developing light industry and heavy industry simultaneously, the situation in which the development of agriculture and light industry was relatively lagging behind heavy industry during the First Five-Year Plan period has undergone significant changes. The development ratio of industry and agriculture and the development ratio of light and heavy industry in our country have both been significantly improved. In terms of the proportion of industry and agriculture, during the First Five-Year Plan period, the average growth rate of our country's industry was 18%, and the average growth rate of agriculture was 4.5%, and the ratio of industrial and agricultural growth rates was four to one; in the past two years, the average growth rate of industry was 52.2%, and the average growth rate of agriculture was 20.8%, and the ratio of industrial and agricultural growth rates was reduced to 2.5 to one. This adjustment of the development ratio of industry and agriculture is suitable for our country's current economic situation. In terms of the proportion of heavy industry and light industry, during the First Five-Year Plan period, the average growth rate of our country's heavy industry was 25.4%, and the average growth rate of light industry was 12.8%, and the ratio of heavy industry and light industry growth rates was 1.98 to one; in 1958, due to the more prominent leap forward speed of heavy industry on the basis of the simultaneous leap forward of light and heavy industry, the development ratio of light and heavy industry was somewhat expanded. In 1959, the growth rate of heavy industry was 43.3%, and the growth rate of light industry was 34%, and the ratio of heavy industry and light industry growth rates was reduced to 1.27 to one. This adjustment of the development ratio of light and heavy industry is also necessary.

After two years of continuous Great Leap Forward, the total value of industrial output and the total value of agricultural output have both overfulfilled the original five-year plan, and the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, which are most decisive for the comprehensive leap forward of the national economy, have also overfulfilled the original five-year plan. This is not a coincidence, but the result of implementing the Party's policy of walking on two legs, first of all, the policy of emphasizing both industry and agriculture, and the result of implementing the policy of basing the entire national economy on agriculture and combining the priority development of heavy industry with the high-speed development of agriculture. Now, the proportional relationship between our country's heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture is more coordinated than at any time in history, and the proportional relationship between the production of means of production and the production of consumer goods, the two major categories, is also more coordinated than at any time in history. And the relationship between heavy, light, and agriculture, the relationship between the two major categories, is precisely the most basic proportional relationship in the national economy. The solution of this basic proportional relationship creates the most favorable conditions for the high-speed and proportional development of the entire national economy in the years to come.

Combining indigenous and foreign methods, enterprises blooming everywhere, our country's industrial layout is more rational.

In the process of completing the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the small and medium-sized enterprises run by local authorities, combining foreign and indigenous production methods, played an extremely important role. Facts have proved that the Party's policy of simultaneously developing central and local industries, simultaneously developing large, medium, and small enterprises, and simultaneously developing foreign and indigenous production methods is a Marxist policy and the only correct policy to accelerate the speed of socialist construction in our country. The large number of small and medium-sized enterprises built during the Great Leap Forward have not only made indelible contributions to the early completion of the Second Five-Year Plan but also have far-reaching strategic significance for accelerating the realization of our country's socialist industrialization.

In order to accelerate the socialist industrialization of our country, in addition to building large-scale enterprises run by the central government and mainly using foreign production methods, it is also necessary to build a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises run by local authorities and mainly using simple production methods. "Large foreign groups" are the backbone of industrialization, but full attention must be paid to the construction of "small foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups." According to this policy, in the past two years, in addition to building thousands of construction projects above the quota every year, we have also built tens of thousands of construction projects below the quota at the same time. In terms of industry, so far, more than 1,000 steel plants, more than 17,000 coal mines, more than 500,000 kilowatts of power stations, more than 400 oil factories, and more than 100 cement plants have been built and put into production nationwide. In addition, there are tens of thousands of machinery factories, chemical factories, and light industrial factories. These small and medium-sized enterprises are spread all over the country, enabling many areas that originally had no industry to establish industry, strengthening areas with a relatively weak industrial foundation, and giving new development to areas with a better industrial foundation. In this way, a good foundation has been laid for the rational layout of our country's industry. Because most of these small and medium-sized enterprises are established in our country's small and medium-sized cities and rural areas and have close ties with the development of agriculture and the socialist transformation of rural areas, and a large part of these enterprises were originally established to support agriculture, the widespread development of these enterprises will inevitably have an increasingly significant impact on promoting the close combination of industry and agriculture, promoting the further rapprochement between cities and villages, and further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

The "blooming everywhere" of small and medium-sized enterprises is of extremely important significance for accelerating the process of socialist industrialization in our country. In our country's current industrial production, the output of "small foreign groups" occupies a very important position. For example, in 1959, more than half of the pig iron output, more than one-third of the steel output, and 40% of the raw coal output were produced by small and medium-sized enterprises. What is important is not only that they occupy such an important position in current production, but that with such a group of small and medium-sized enterprises widely distributed throughout the country, a foundation has been laid for a sustained Great Leap Forward in the years to come. When everyone gathers firewood, the flames rise high. On the basis of a rational layout, the output of ten enterprises doubling simultaneously is undoubtedly much easier than the output of one enterprise doubling ten times. This is the objective basis for our country's industry to be able to continue to leap forward, and it is also an important experience to accelerate the speed of industrial development in our country.

The People's Commune is the best organizational form for realizing a Great Leap Forward in agricultural production.

The early completion of the Second Five-Year Plan is inseparable from the establishment, consolidation, and development of the People's Commune. The high-speed development of the national economy requires an organizational form that adapts to this development speed, and the People's Commune is precisely the best organizational form for realizing a Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, and it is also the best organizational form for agricultural Great Leap Forward to promote industrial Great Leap Forward.

The Great Leap Forward produced the People's Commune, and the consolidation and development of the People's Commune, in turn, promoted the Great Leap Forward. The two years in which the People's Commune movement achieved great victories were also the two years in which the development of industrial and agricultural production, especially agricultural production, was the fastest in the history of our country. From 1950 to 1957, our country's industrial production increased by 4.6 times, an average annual increase of 24%, and agricultural production increased by 85%, an average annual increase of 8%; in 1958 and 1959, our country's industrial production increased by 131.5%, an average annual increase of 52.2%, and agricultural production increased by 45.8%, an average annual increase of 20.8%. It is particularly worth noting that the high-speed growth of agricultural production in our country in 1959 was achieved under the conditions of severe natural disasters that had not been seen in decades, and the greater superiority of the People's Commune over the advanced cooperative was once again proven here.

The People's Commune is not only the best organizational form for implementing the "Eight-Character Charter," overcoming natural disasters, and realizing the agricultural Great Leap Forward, but also the best organizational form for organizing the comprehensive leap forward of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries and realizing the industrialization of the commune. After the rectification and consolidation work in 1959, the People's Commune has now embarked on the road of sound development. In the great task of realizing our country's industrial modernization, agricultural modernization, and scientific and cultural modernization, the People's Commune will surely play a more important historical role.

The early realization of the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan marks that the journey that was originally intended to be completed in five years in the process of socialist construction in our country was completed in only two years. Now, our country's socialist construction has embarked on a new stage. The main content of this new stage is to strive to catch up with the United Kingdom in terms of the output of major industrial products within ten years on the basis of a sustained leap forward, as proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. At the same time, we must also use a shorter period of time to realize the agricultural development program originally scheduled to be realized in 1967. The general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune are the three magic weapons for realizing this great goal; a set of "walking on two legs" policies are the fundamental measures for realizing this great goal. We have all the conditions necessary to achieve this goal. As long as we adhere to the banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune and adhere to the policy of "walking on two legs" under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of our country will surely be able to complete this great historical task.

    提前三年完成第二个五年计划的伟大意义
    吴俊扬
    经过1958年和1959年两年的连续大跃进，中国共产党八届八中全会提出的提前三年完成第二个五年计划主要指标的号召，已经胜利的实现了。这是我国社会主义建设史上具有重大历史意义的一件大事。第二个五年计划的提前完成，证明党的社会主义建设的总路线是完全正确的，大跃进的发展速度是完全可能的，人民公社的组织形式是具有无限强大的生命力的。由于我们用两年的时间就完成了五年的任务，这就大大加快了我国社会主义建设的进程，加强了我国工业化的基础，开辟了高速度发展我国农业的道路，并且从政治思想上和物质技术上为我国今后年份的社会主义建设奠定了一个持续大跃进的局面。
    第二个五年计划的提前完成，进一步加强了社会主义阵营的力量，有力地鼓舞了一切不发达国家摆脱帝国主义束缚和发展民族经济的信心和决心，再一次显示了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的无比优越性。因此，第二个五年计划的完成，不仅在我国国内，而且在国际上同样也具有伟大的历史意义。它以最鲜明的事实，又一次证明了毛泽东同志提出的东风已经压倒西风的英明论断。
    在主要产品的产量方面，我国同英国之间的距离大大缩短了
    我国的第二个五年计划，是在1956年9月党的第八届全国代表大会上提出，并在1957年2月经国务院通过的。按照原定的计划，到1962年，工农业总产值要比1957年增长75％左右，其中工业总产值要比1957年增长一倍左右，农业总产值要比1957年增长35％左右。实际执行的结果，1959年的工农业总产值就比1957年增长94．4％，其中工业总产值比1957年增长一点三一五倍，农业总产值比1957年增长45．8％。在工农业生产高速度发展的基础上，我国的国民收入增长了62．86％，而原来的计划是增长50％左右。工农业总产值和国民收入的提前完成第二个五年计划，表明在社会生产的总的发展水平方面，原来打算用五年时间实现的目标，现在只用两年就已经达到了。
    在主要产品的产量方面，第二个五年计划原来规定了二十四项生产指标，根据国家统计局的初步统计，1959年已经有十三项产品即钢、煤、发电量、冶金设备、发电设备、金属切削机床、原木、棉纱、棉布、盐、机制纸、粮食和棉花达到并超过了原定的生产指标；在没有达到原定指标的十一项产品中，水泥和大豆已经接近原定指标，其他那些产品虽然还没有达到原定的指标，但就其增长速度来说，也已经大大超过了原定的计划。例如按照原定的计划计算：原油的平均增长速度为20％至24．4％，而过去两年的实际为59．3％；铝锭的平均增长速度为38％至43．1％，而过去两年的实际为55．8％；化学肥料的平均增长速度为39％至40．8％，而过去两年的实际则为45．3％。由此可见，对国民经济的发展具有决定意义的一些生产指标，完成的情况都是很好的。
    第二个五年计划的提前完成，使我国在主要产品的产量方面，同英国之间的距离不仅已经大大缩短，而且有些产品已经超过了英国的生产水平。在1957年，即党中央提出十五年左右在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上英国的口号的那一年，英国生产钢二千二百零四万吨，生铁一千四百五十五万吨，煤二亿二千七百二十二万吨，而我国那一年只生产钢五百三十五万吨，生铁五百九十三万六千吨，煤一亿三千万吨，也就是说，我国的钢产量只有英国的24．3％，生铁产量只有英国的40．8％，煤产量只有英国的57．2％。仅仅经过两年，我国的钢产量已经增加到一千三百三十五万吨，生铁产量已经增加到二千零五十万吨，原煤产量已经增加到三亿四千七百八十万吨，而英国经过1958年的经济危机，1959年钢产量却下降到二千零二十万吨，生铁产量下降到一千二百六十万吨，煤产量下降到二亿零六百万吨，也就是说，我国钢产量已经由1957年相当于英国钢产量的24．3％上升到1959年的66％，而生铁和原煤的产量却已经把这个老牌帝国主义远远地抛到后面去了。诚然，我们现在还有一些主要产品的产量还没有赶上英国，但两年来的发展趋势已经可以看得很清楚：在主要产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国的时间，肯定比原来的设想还要快。两年，这在人类历史上说只不过是一霎眼的功夫，然而我国却在这样短促的时间内取得了这样伟大的成就，这难道不是社会主义犹如旭日东升、而帝国主义却已日薄西山的新的有力的证据吗？
    我国国民经济中最基本的比例关系更加协调了
    国民经济的高速度发展是一切社会主义国家的共同规律，也是我国第一个五年计划和第二个五年计划的共同规律。但第一个五年计划的高速度，只是一般的高速度，而不是、也不可能是大跃进的高速度。这不仅是因为在第一个五年计划期间，我国的工业基础还很薄弱，大跃进所需要的物质条件还不够充分，更主要的是因为在第一个五年计划的大部分时间内，我国还处在社会主义改造的条件下，社会主义革命的任务还没有完成，这就不能不影响到人民群众的生产积极性。到1956年由于对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的基本完成，特别是经过1957年的反右斗争，我国的社会主义革命就不仅在经济战线上，而且在政治战线和思想战线上也取得了决定的胜利，人民群众的生产积极性才充分发挥出来。在这样的条件下，党中央和毛泽东同志又及时的提出了社会主义建设的总路线，这就造成了两年的连续大跃进。由此可见，在我国的社会主义建设中出现大跃进的高速度，特别是持续跃进的高速度，是同党的社会主义建设总路线的制定和贯彻执行分不开的。总路线是大跃进的最根本的动力。第二个五年计划的提前完成，使总路线的光辉更加灿烂，总路线的思想更加深入人心，从而在政治上和思想上为我国今后的社会主义建设奠定了一个持续跃进的局面。
    第二个五年计划的提前完成，也是毛泽东同志指示的我国工业化的道路的胜利。毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中指出：“……工业化道路的问题，主要是指重工业、轻工业和农业的发展关系问题。我国的经济建设是以重工业为中心，这一点必须肯定。但是同时必须充分注意发展农业和轻工业。”两年来，我国的社会主义建设，正是沿着毛泽东同志指示的这条道路前进的。两年的连续大跃进，显著地加强了我国工业化的物质技术基础，这种加强，不仅表现在重工业产品的飞跃增长上，同时也表现在工农业的发展比例和轻重工业的发展比例的进一步改善上。
    就重工业的发展来说，在“以钢为纲、全面跃进”的方针下，几乎所有的重工业产品两年来都增长了一倍以上，例如：钢增长了一点五倍，生铁增长了二点四五倍，原煤增长了一点六八倍，发电量增长了一点一五倍，原油增长了一点五四倍，金属切削机床增长了一点五倍，化学肥料增长了一点一倍等等。我国重工业的飞跃发展，不仅表现在量的增长方面，而且也表现在质的提高方面。现在，我国的机械工业已经能够生产像一千五百一十三立米的高炉和二千五百吨水压机这样的重型机械，能够生产容量为五万瓩的火力发电设备和七万二千五百瓩的水力发电设备，汽车、飞机、拖拉机和高效能的蒸汽机车，都已成批生产；我国钢铁工业所生产的钢材品种已经达到六千多种。机械设备和钢材这两种最重要的生产资料的自给率，现在已经达到80％以上。我国重工业的这种飞跃的发展，大大加强了扩大再生产的物质基础，加强了对国民经济首先是对农业进行技术改造的物质基础。据统计，随着重工业的大跃进，在过去的两年中，国家供应农业的钢材，就比第一个五年的总和还多。大跃进以来，国家供应农业的排灌机械、拖拉机、联合收割机和载重汽车，也大大超过了第一个五年的总和。而在今后，在工业化的基础已经加强并将继续加强的条件下，我们就有可能更快更好地推进国民经济首先是农业的技术改造，使我国的农业更快的建立在现代技术的基础上，更快的提高农业劳动生产率。
    就重工业、轻工业和农业的发展关系来说，在党的发展工业和发展农业同时并举、发展轻工业和发展重工业同时并举的方针下，第一个五年计划期间曾经出现的农业和轻工业的发展相对地落后于重工业的情况已经有显著的变化，我国工农业的发展比例和轻重工业的发展比例，都已有了显著的改善。在工农业的比例方面，在第一个五年计划期间，我国工业的平均增长速度为18％，农业的平均增长速度为4．5％，工业和农业增长速度的比例为四比一；在过去的两年内，工业的平均增长速度为52．2％，农业的平均增长速度为20．8％，工业和农业增长速度的比例缩小为二点五比一。工农业发展比例的这种调整，是适合于我国当前的经济情况的。在重工业和轻工业的比例方面，在第一个五年计划期间，我国重工业的平均增长速度为25．4％，轻工业的平均增长速度为12．8％，重工业和轻工业增长速度的比例为一点九八比一；1958年，由于在轻重工业同时跃进的基础上重工业的跃进速度更突出一些，轻重工业的发展比例有所扩大，1959年重工业的增长速度为43．3％，轻工业的增长速度为34％，重工业和轻工业增长速度的比例缩小为一点二七比一。轻重工业发展比例的这种调整，同样也是需要的。
    经过两年的连续大跃进，工业总产值和农业总产值都超额完成了原定的五年计划，对国民经济的全面跃进最有决定意义的钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标也都超额完成了原定的五年计划，这并不是偶然的巧合，而是贯彻执行了党的两条腿走路的方针首先是工农业并举的方针的结果，是贯彻执行了整个国民经济以农业为基础、把优先发展重工业同高速度发展农业相结合起来的方针的结果。现在，我国的重工业、轻工业和农业的比例关系，比历史上任何时期都更加协调，生产资料生产同消费资料生产这两大部类之间的比例关系，也比历史上任何时期都更加协调，而重、轻、农的关系，两大部类的关系，正是国民经济中最基本的比例关系。这个基本的比例关系的解决，就为今后年份内整个国民经济的既有高速度、又有按比例的发展创造了最有利的条件。
    土洋结合，企业遍地开花，我国工业的布局更加合理了
    在提前完成第二个五年计划的过程中，地方举办的、洋法生产和土法生产相结合的中小型企业起了极其重要的作用。事实已经证明，党的中央工业和地方工业同时并举、大中小型企业同时并举以及洋法生产和土法生产同时并举的方针是马克思主义的方针，是加快我国社会主义建设速度的唯一正确的方针。在大跃进中建设起来的大量的中小型企业，不仅对第二个五年计划的提前完成建立了不可磨灭的功勋，而且对加速实现我国的社会主义工业化，也具有深远的战略意义。
    为了加速进行我国的社会主义工业化，除了建设中央举办的，以洋法生产为主的大型企业外，还必须大量建设地方举办的，以简易方法生产为主的中小型企业。“大洋群”是工业化的骨干，但必须充分注意“小洋群”和“小土群”的建设。按照这样的方针，在过去的两年中，我们每年除了兴建上千个限额以上的建设项目外，同时还兴建了数以万计的限额以下的建设项目。就工业来说，到现在为止，全国建成和投入生产的中小型企业已有钢铁厂一千多个，煤矿一万七千多座，电站五十多万瓩，石油厂四百多个，水泥厂一百多个。此外，还有成千上万个机械厂、化工厂和轻工业工厂。这些中小型企业遍布于全国的各个角落，使许多原来没有工业的地区建立了工业，使原来工业基础比较薄弱的地区得到了加强，而原来工业基础较好的地区也有了新的发展。这样，就为我国工业的合理布局奠定了一个良好的基础。由于这些中小型企业大部分都建立在我国的中小城市和农村，同农业的发展和农村的社会主义改造有着密切联系，其中很大一部分企业原来就是为支援农业而建立起来的，因此，这些企业的广泛发展，对于促进工业和农业的密切结合，对于促进城市和乡村的进一步接近，对于工农联盟的更加巩固，必将发生愈来愈显著的影响。
    中小型企业的“遍地开花”，对于加快我国社会主义工业化的进程具有极其重要的意义。在我国目前的工业生产中，“小洋群”的产量占了很重要的地位，例如：1959年生铁产量的一半以上，钢产量的三分之一以上和原煤产量的40％，都是由中小型企业生产的。重要的还不仅是在目前生产中占了这样重要的地位，而在于有了这样一批广泛地分布在全国的中小型企业，就奠定了一个在今后年份内可以持续大跃进的基础。众人拾柴火焰高，在合理布局的基础上，十个企业的产量同时翻一番，无疑要比一个企业的产量翻十番容易得多，这就是我国工业能够持续大跃进的客观根据，也是加快我国工业发展速度的一条重要经验。
    人民公社是实现农业生产大跃进最好的组织形式
    第二个五年计划的提前完成，是同人民公社的建立、巩固和发展分不开的。国民经济的高速度发展，需要有同这种发展速度相适应的组织形式，而人民公社正是实现农业生产大跃进的最好的组织形式，也是农业大跃进促进工业大跃进的最好的组织形式。
    大跃进产生了人民公社，而人民公社的巩固和发展，又反过来促进了大跃进。人民公社运动取得伟大胜利的两年，也是我国历史上工农业生产特别是农业生产发展最快的两年，从1950年到1957年，我国的工业生产增加了四点六倍，平均每年增长24％，农业生产增加了85％，平均每年增长8％；在1958和1959这两年内，我国的工业生产增加了131．5％，平均每年增长52．2％，农业生产增加了45．8％，平均每年增长20．8％。特别值得注意的是，1959年我国农业生产的高速度增长，是在几十年来所没有过的严重的自然灾害的条件下达到的，人民公社比高级合作社具有更多的优越性，在这里又得到了新的证明。
    人民公社不仅是贯彻执行“八字宪法”、克服自然灾害和实现农业大跃进的最好的组织形式，而且是组织农林牧副渔全面跃进和实现公社工业化的最好的组织形式。经过1959年的整顿和巩固工作，人民公社现在已经走上了健全发展的道路，在实现我国的工业现代化、农业现代化和科学文化现代化的伟大任务中，人民公社一定会起更加重要的历史作用。
    第二个五年计划主要指标的提前实现，标志着我国社会主义建设的进程中原来打算用五年时间走完的路程，只用两年时间就走完了。现在，我国的社会主义建设已经走上了一个新的阶段，这个新阶段的主要内容，就是要在持续跃进的基础上，争取用更短的时间来实现党的八届八中全会提出的十年内在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上英国的号召，同时，也要用更短的时间来实现原定在1967年实现的农业发展纲要。总路线、大跃进、人民公社，就是实现这一伟大目标的三个法宝；一套“两条腿走路”的方针就是实现这一伟大目标的根本措施。我们有着实现这一目标所需要的一切条件，只要我们在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导下坚持总路线、大跃进和人民公社的旗帜，坚持“两条腿走路”的方针，我国人民就一定能够完成这个伟大的历史任务。
