Increase Attendance Rate and Strive for a Bumper Harvest
Albanian Villages Launch "300 Workday Movement"

    Albanian agricultural workers are launching the "300 Workday Movement" to strive for an even greater agricultural harvest this year.
    This movement was initiated by members of the Korovishi Agricultural Cooperative in the Gjirokastër District. When discussing this new initiative, they said that it would not only increase labor attendance and agricultural production, but also be a manifestation of a socialist attitude towards labor.
    This initiative has received the attention and support of the Albanian Labor Party. On January 17, Enver Hoxha, the First Secretary of the Party Central Committee, issued an open letter to agricultural workers across the country specifically regarding this initiative. The letter pointed out that this initiative is of great significance for consolidating agricultural cooperatives, helping to raise the labor consciousness of members and the great creativity of the rural working masses. In the open letter, Hoxha instructed the Party committees at all levels to submit this initiative to the members' congresses of agricultural cooperatives for discussion in order to gain support and promotion. He also instructed the Central Committee of the Labor Youth League to promote this initiative among rural youth, so that the youth would be the first to respond to this movement.
    At present, more than 300 advanced farmers in the Gjirokastër District have responded to the "300 Workday Movement." Cooperative member Yovani completed 330 workdays in ten months last year, and he guarantees that he will do more workdays this year. Cooperative member Memua proposed not only to work more, but also to work well, ensuring excellent quality.
    The Gjirokastër District Party Committee and the District Executive Committee also proposed that those who complete more than 300 workdays will be awarded the title of "Socialist Labor Model."

    提高出勤率  争取大丰收
    阿农村掀起“三百个劳动日运动”
    阿尔巴尼亚农业劳动者正在开展“三百个劳动日运动”，以争取今年农业的更大丰收。
    这个运动是由吉诺卡斯特区科罗维希农业合作社社员发起的。他们在谈论这一新的倡议时说，这不仅可以提高劳动出勤率，增加农业生产，而且也是以社会主义的态度对待劳动的表现。
    这一倡议获得了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的重视和支持。党中央第一书记霍查1月17日特就这一倡议向全国农业劳动者发出了一封公开信。信中指出，这一倡议对巩固农业合作社具有重大的意义，它有助于提高社员们的劳动自觉，提高农村劳动群众的巨大创造力。霍查在公开信中指示劳动党各级党委应把这一倡议提交到农业社社员大会上讨论，以获得支持和推广。他并指示劳动青年联盟中央委员会在农村青年中推广这一倡议，使青年们首先来响应这一运动。
    目前，在吉诺卡斯特区已有三百多个先进的农民响应了“三百个劳动日运动”。社员约瓦尼去年十个月就完成了三百三十个劳动日，他保证今年要做出更多的劳动日。社员梅穆亚提出不但要劳动得多，而且要劳动得好，保证优等的质量。
    吉诺卡斯特区党委会和区执行委员会并提出，劳动日达到三百个以上的人，将荣获“社会主义劳动模范”的称号。
