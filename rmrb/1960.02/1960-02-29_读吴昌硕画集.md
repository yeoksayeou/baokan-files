    Reading Wu Changshuo's Collection of Paintings
    Pan Xiezhi
    Mr. Wu Changshuo from Anji, Zhejiang, was an outstanding master of freehand flower-and-bird painting in China in the last hundred years. His artistic creations had a great influence on the art scene at that time and even today. He worked diligently throughout his life and left us countless works, which have become a precious artistic asset for us. Recently, the China Classical Art Publishing House published "Wu Changshuo's Collection of Paintings," which selected eighty of his masterpieces, providing us with rich materials for studying his art.

    The greatest feature of Mr. Wu Changshuo's paintings is the combination of calligraphy and epigraphy. The three penetrate each other and become a harmonious whole. In each work, we can see his ingenious management. His inscriptions and seals are inseparable components of the painting; together they are perfect, and apart they are damaged. For example, the inscriptions and seals of "Double Peach," "Chrysanthemum by the Fence," and "Noble and Gorgeous Colors" are almost irreplaceable. In the painting "Lychee," the poem inscription encroaches on the painting space, making the sentiment even deeper. As for the calligraphic and epigraphic flavor embodied in the brushstrokes themselves, it is obvious to all. Therefore, when discussing Mr. Wu Changshuo's paintings, one cannot ignore calligraphy and epigraphy.

    Mr. Wu Changshuo himself once said, "I studied poetry at thirty and painting at fifty." He did start painting relatively late, but before learning to paint, he already had a profound literary, calligraphic, and epigraphic cultivation, which was very beneficial to his paintings. Almost every one of his works is inscribed with self-composed poems or has a poetic artistic conception. He inherited the fine tradition of Chinese literati painting and developed and enriched it.

    Chinese freehand flower-and-bird painting has become increasingly popular since Xu Wei and Chen Chun, but before Wu Changshuo, only calligraphy was incorporated into the paintings. Zhao Zhiqian had already begun to incorporate epigraphic flavor, but it was still in the early stages of experimentation. It was not until Wu Changshuo that he brought it to its full potential, bold and unrestrained, bringing its expression to the extreme, and creating a new era for freehand flower-and-bird painting. In his early years, Wu Changshuo deliberately studied the ancients (such as Jin Nong and Wang Shishen for plum blossoms), and also widely absorbed the strengths of contemporary painters such as Zhao Zhiqian, Ren Bonian, Hu Gongshou, and Pu Zuoying, but he was still able to appear with his own face, which is enough to show that he was good at learning (the works in this collection are all marked with the year of creation, which shows the evolution of his style). "Painting should come from one's own ideas, imitation falls into the dust, even if it can be similar, it has fallen behind the ancients." This is his artistic proposition. In that era when imitating the ancients was prevalent, this spirit was very commendable.

    Mr. Wu Changshuo's creativity is also reflected in his use of color. He is good at using bright and strong colors without being frivolous and flamboyant. For example, the red and dark green of "Lychee" and "Sacred Bamboo," the bright red of the peony in "Peony and Narcissus," and the yellow and black of "Loquat" and "Gourd" are all strongly contrasted, but instead achieve a harmonious and unified effect. This is indeed a bold and ingenious technique. Mr. Qi Baishi learned his strengths, and there are many similarities in composition, brushwork, and coloring. Of course, the old man Baishi has absorbed, digested, and developed it further.

    Mr. Qi Baishi deeply admired Wu Changshuo's art. He has a poem inscribed on a painting:
    Xu Wei and Chen Chun are far from the mortal world, and Wu Changshuo has talent in his old age;
    I would like to be a running dog in the netherworld, and reincarnate under the three masters.

    Wu Changshuo's paintings can achieve such great achievements, in addition to his good at learning from the strengths of ancient and modern painters, giving full play to personal creativity, and profound literary, calligraphy, and epigraphic cultivation, the more important thing is his diligent work. He came from humble origins and had the precious qualities of ordinary people: uprightness, simplicity, hard work, and endurance. His paintings are majestic and also express the heroic spirit of the Chinese people.

    There are many things to learn from Wu Changshuo's paintings. The publication of this collection will undoubtedly be welcomed by enthusiasts and researchers of Wu Changshuo's art; for general readers, they can also get artistic enjoyment here. (Attached picture)

    读吴昌硕画集
    潘絜兹
    浙江安吉吴昌硕先生，是我国近百年来杰出的写意花卉画大师。他的艺术创造对于当时以至今天的画坛，都有着很大的影响。他一生辛勤劳动，给我们留下了不计其数的作品，成为我们一项珍贵的艺术财富。最近中国古典艺术出版社出版了“吴昌硕画集”，选辑了他的八十幅精品，为我们研究他的艺术提供了丰富的材料。
    吴昌硕先生的画最大的特色是和书法、金石相结合。三者互相渗透，浑然成为一体。在每幅作品中，我们都可以看出他的匠心经营。他的题跋、印章是画的不可分的组成部分，合则尽美，离则俱伤。如“双桃”、“篱菊”、“高风艳色”的题字和印章几乎不可移易。“荔枝”一画，题诗侵入画位，情味更深。至于画笔本身所体现出来的书法味与金石味，更是有目共赏。所以谈到吴昌硕先生的画是不能撇开书法和金石的。
    吴昌硕先生自己曾说过“三十学诗、五十学画”的话，他从事绘画确是比较晚的，但他在学画之前，已有了深厚的文学、书法和金石的修养，这对于他的画很有好处。他的作品几乎每幅都题有自撰的诗句，或者富有诗的意境。他继承了中国文人画的优良传统，而且发展和丰富了它。
    中国写意花卉画从青藤、白阳以来便已日益流行了，但是在吴昌硕以前，还只有书法入画的。赵撝叔虽然已开始融入金石味，但尚属于尝试的初期，到吴昌硕始集其大成，纵横恣肆，发挥其极致，为写意花卉别开生面。吴昌硕早年曾刻意学古人（如梅花学金冬心、汪士慎），也曾广泛吸取同时代画家如赵撝叔、任伯年、胡公寿、蒲作英诸人的长处，但他毕竟能以自己的面目出现，这就足以说明他是善于学习的（这本画集的作品，都注有创作年代，可以看出他风格的演变）。“画当出己意，摹仿堕尘垢，即使能似之，已落古人后。”这就是他的艺术主张。在那个临仿古人风气盛行的当时，这种精神是非常难能可贵的。
    吴昌硕先生的创造性还表现在他用色方面。他善于用鲜明强烈的色彩而并不流于浮艳火炽。如“荔枝”、“天竹”的红与墨绿，“牡丹水仙”中牡丹的艳红，“枇杷”、“葫芦”的黄与黑，都是对照强烈反而取得谐调一致的效果的，这实在是一种大胆而巧妙的手法。齐白石先生学到了他的好处，在构画、用笔、设色方面有很多类似之处。当然白石老人又是经过吸收消化而又有所发展了的。
    对于吴昌硕的艺术，白石老人是深致倾倒之忱的。他有题画诗：
    青藤雪个远凡胎，老缶衰年别有才；
    我欲九原为走狗，三家门下转轮来。
    吴昌硕的画所以能有这样巨大的成就，除了他善于师法古今画家之长、发挥个人创造，和精深的文学、书法、金石修养之外，更重要的是他的勤奋劳动。他出身寒苦，有着普通平民正直纯朴、刻苦耐劳的可贵品质。他的画大气磅礴，也表现了中国人民的雄大气魄。
    吴昌硕的画，可以学习的地方很多。这本画集的出版，无疑会受到吴昌硕艺术的爱好者和研究者的欢迎；对于一般读者，也可以在这里得到艺术享受。（附图片）
