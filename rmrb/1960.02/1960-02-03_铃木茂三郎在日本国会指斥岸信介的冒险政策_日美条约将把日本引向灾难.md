    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 2nd: Suzuki Mosaburo, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party and member of the House of Representatives, today sharply questioned Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's policy address at the regular Diet session, strongly condemning the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" which is hostile to China and the Soviet Union.
    Suzuki pointed out that the new "Security Treaty," under the guise of maintaining peace in the Far East, will repeat the mistake of plunging Japan into the abyss of destruction. He said that due to the signing of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," major international issues encountered by Japan will involve China and the Soviet Union. He asked whether the Nobusuke Kishi government, which signed the new "Security Treaty" regardless of everything, had foreseen these difficulties. Suzuki pointed out that Nobusuke Kishi made a wrong judgment of the world situation.
    Suzuki said that the new "Security Treaty" is a military alliance that clearly violates the Japanese Constitution. He pointed out that the conclusion of this treaty is a major national event as important as amending the Constitution, and the Nobusuke Kishi government should dissolve the Diet and ask the Japanese people to decide on this treaty before submitting it to the Diet for ratification.
    Suzuki also pointed out that Japan's attempt to carry out economic expansion in Southeast Asia is causing concern in various countries.
    Democrat Socialist Party member Chosaburo Mizutani questioned that signing the new "Security Treaty" means increasing Japan's military strength, which runs counter to easing international tensions. Mizutani said that the Kishi Nobusuke government's diplomatic policy of strengthening military and economic cooperation only with the "free world" is dangerous, and Japan should adopt an independent and autonomous policy of not participating in the Cold War and not forming military alliances with any camp.
    In response to these inquiries, Nobusuke Kishi repeated the clichés in his policy address, defended the new "Security Treaty," and emphasized "cooperation" with the United States. He stubbornly said that the Southeast Asian countries that had suffered from Japanese militarism "did not feel uneasy about the Security Treaty."
    Nobusuke Kishi, who had just signed the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty with the main purpose of military aggression, hypocritically stated that he advocated "absolute avoidance of war." At this time, Socialist Party members in the conference hall shouted "Lies."

    铃木茂三郎在日本国会指斥岸信介的冒险政策
    日美条约将把日本引向灾难
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长、众议院议员铃木茂三郎今天在平时国会会议上就岸信介首相发表的施政演说提出了尖锐的质询，强烈地谴责了以中苏为敌的新日美“安全条约”。
    铃木指出，新“安全条约”将在维护远东和平的美名下重犯使日本陷于灭亡的深渊的错误。他说，由于签订新的日美“安全条约”，日本在国际上遇到的重大问题都将牵涉到中国和苏联。他问道，不顾一切地签订新“安全条约”的岸信介政府，是否预料到这种困难。铃木指出，岸信介对世界形势作出了错误的判断。
    铃木说，新“安全条约”是一种军事同盟，显然违反日本宪法。他指出，缔结这项条约是一件像修改宪法那样重要的国家大事，岸信介政府在把这项条约提交国会批准以前，应当解散国会，请日本国民对这项条约进行裁决。
    铃木还指出，日本对东南亚进行经济扩张的企图正在引起各国的忧虑。
    日本民主社会党议员水谷长三郎提出质询说，签署新“安全条约”就要增加日本的军事力量，这是同缓和国际紧张局势背道而驰的。水谷说，岸信介政府的只同“自由世界”加强军事、经济合作的外交方针是危险的，日本应当采取不参与冷战、不同任何一个阵营结成军事同盟的独立自主方针。
    岸信介在答复这些质询时，重复了他在施政演说中的陈词滥调，为新“安全条约”辩解，强调同美国实行“合作”，他硬说，曾经遭受日本军国主义蹂躏的东南亚各国“并没有对安全条约感到不安”。
    刚刚签订了以军事侵略为主旨的日美军事同盟条约的岸信介假惺惺地表示，他主张“要绝对避免战争”。这时，会议厅里的社会党议员大声喊道“撒谎”。
