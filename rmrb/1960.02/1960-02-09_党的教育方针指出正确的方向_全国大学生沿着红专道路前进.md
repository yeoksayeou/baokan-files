    The Party's Education Policy Points Out the Correct Direction
    College Students Nationwide Advance Along the Red and Expert Road

    According to Xinhua News Agency on the 8th, with the rapid development of China's education and the implementation of the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor," tremendous changes have taken place in the number and quality of students in China's higher education institutions in recent years. At present, 810,000 college students across the country, under the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are striving to transform themselves into intellectuals of the working class who possess a high level of cultural and scientific knowledge, advancing along the road of being both Red and expert.

    In the past few years, Chinese students, through the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, have worked hard in the combination of teaching and scientific research, and productive labor. Their political and ideological consciousness has been significantly improved, and a large number of students have actively applied to join the Communist Youth League and the Communist Party. According to statistics from 32 schools in Shaanxi Province, Party and League members account for 66.9% of college students; students' academic performance has also made considerable progress.

    Studying for the construction of a socialist and communist motherland has become the common goal of the majority of young students. Most students love their majors from the first day they enter school and engage in creative learning. Students in the sericulture department of the third grade of Southwest Agricultural College, seeing the important role that the sericulture profession plays in prospering the socialist economy and people's lives in the motherland, are honored to be engaged in this work. In their studies, they actively research scientific methods to improve silkworm production and quality, and created a new record of raising silkworms ten times a year. Due to the improvement of political and ideological consciousness and the clarity of learning goals, many students have broken away from the narrow confines of bourgeois individualism and entered the infinitely broad new world of working-class collectivism. What everyone cares about is no longer the individual or the small self, but the big family of the motherland and the needs of socialist construction for science and technology. Therefore, earnest reading, hard study, and carrying out scientific research have become a common practice. In the past two years, hundreds of thousands of college students across the country have actively participated in scientific research activities in conjunction with the needs of teaching and production construction. In 1959, students at Northwestern Polytechnical University established 169 scientific research groups, completed 154 research tasks, and held 45 scientific report meetings. At the same time, studying Marxism-Leninism, studying Chairman Mao's works, and continuously improving ideological awareness and theoretical level have also gradually become the conscious requirements of students. Many students from Sichuan College of Political Science and Law, Harbin Institute of Technology, and other schools have made great achievements in this area.

    Love for labor and love for the working people have become the good qualities of college students in New China. This is a major victory for the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor." In 1958, college students across the country closely combined learning and labor, going in batches to factories, mines, construction sites, and rural areas to eat, live, and work with workers and peasants, learning from the workers and peasants. During the mass steelmaking movement, 90,000 science and engineering students from colleges and universities went to the steel front lines, actively and enthusiastically participating in and supporting mass steelmaking and the "Three Autumns" movement. Two thousand teachers and students from the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology were sent to 22 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions to participate in local mining, ironmaking, steelmaking, and machine equipment manufacturing. This college adopted the method of "steelmaking in the furnace and tempering people outside the furnace," which enabled teachers and students to receive good training. Students from agricultural and forestry colleges across the country have also generally improved during their work in rural areas. Through labor, the class viewpoint, mass viewpoint, labor viewpoint, collective viewpoint, and dialectical materialism viewpoint of the majority of students have been greatly strengthened.

    The Party's general line for socialist construction and the call to break superstitions and liberate thought have encouraged the fearless spirit of daring to think and dare to act among the majority of young students. Since 1958, college students in various places have made great achievements in carrying out scientific research work. Many cutting-edge scientific research projects and cutting-edge products, such as large-scale planetariums, analog electronic computers, cyclotrons, program-controlled machine tools, etc., have been researched and manufactured by college students. The young students of the electric (55) locomotive class of Tangshan Railway Institute, under the encouragement and support of the Party, after five months of hard work and ingenuity, successfully trial-produced China's first 300-kilowatt single-phase industrial frequency commutator traction motor. The third-year students of the sericulture department of Southwest Agricultural College dared to think and dare to act, not only creating a new record of raising silkworms ten times a year, but also reeling raw silk with a quality reaching 6A grade under conditions of simple equipment and poor technology. Today, young college students have become an important force on China's science front.

    党的教育方针指出正确的方向
    全国大学生沿着红专道路前进
    据新华社8日讯　随着我国教育事业的飞速发展，和党的“教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针的贯彻执行，近几年来，我国高等学校学生的数量和质量发生了巨大的变化。目前，全国八十一万大学生在毛泽东思想的红旗下，正沿着又红又专的道路，为把自己造就成为掌握高度文化科学水平的工人阶级的知识分子而奋勉前进。
    几年来，我国广大学生经过政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，在教学与科学研究、生产劳动相结合中努力学习，政治思想觉悟有了显著的提高，大批学生积极要求入团、入党。据陕西省三十二所学校统计，大学生中党、团员已占66．9％；学生的学习成绩也有了长足的进步。
    为建设社会主义、共产主义的祖国而学习，已经成为广大青年学生的一致目标。大部分学生从入学第一天起就热爱自己的专业，并且进行创造性的学习。西南农学院蚕桑系三年级的学生，看到蚕桑专业对繁荣祖国社会主义经济和人民生活所起的重要作用，都以能从事这一工作为光荣。他们在学习中，积极研究提高蚕桑产量、质量的科学方法，并且创造了一年养蚕十次的新纪录。由于政治思想觉悟提高，学习目的明确，许多学生摆脱了资产阶级个人主义的狭小圈子，走进了工人阶级集体主义无限广阔的新天地，大家关心的不再是个人、小我，而是祖国大家庭，是社会主义建设事业对科学、技术的需要。因此，认真读书、刻苦钻研、开展科学研究已蔚为风气。近两年来，全国高等学校有几十万学生结合教学和生产建设的需要，积极参加了科学研究活动。西北工业大学的学生在1959年成立了一百六十九个科学研究小组，完成了一百五十四项研究任务，举行了科学报告会四十五次。同时，学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛主席著作，不断提高思想觉悟和理论水平，也逐渐成为学生们的自觉要求。四川政法公安学院、哈尔滨工业大学等学校的许多学生，都已在这方面获得了较大成绩。
    热爱劳动和热爱劳动人民，已经成为新中国大学生的良好品质，这是党的“教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”方针的重大胜利。1958年，全国高等学校学生把学习和劳动紧密结合起来，分批到工厂、矿山、建筑工地、农村，和工农群众同吃、同住、同劳动，向工农学习，在全民大炼钢铁运动中，九万名高等学校的理科、工科学生走上了钢铁前线，积极热情地参加和支援了群众炼钢和“三秋”运动。北京钢铁工业学院两千名师生下放到二十二个省、市、自治区参加各地采矿、炼铁、炼钢和机器设备制造等工作。这所学院采取了“炉内炼钢、炉外炼人”的方法，使师生们受到了很好的锻炼。全国农林院校的学生在下放农村劳动中，也普遍得到了提高。通过劳动，广大学生阶级观点、群众观点、劳动观点、集体观点和辩证唯物主义观点，都大大加强了。
    党的社会主义建设总路线和破除迷信、解放思想的号召，鼓舞了广大青年学生敢想敢干的大无畏精神。1958年以来，各地大学生们在开展科学研究工作中，取得了巨大成绩。许多尖端科学研究项目和尖端产品，如大型天象仪、模拟电子计算机、回旋加速器、程序控制机床等等，都陆续地从大学生手中研究、制造出来。唐山铁道学院电（55）机车班的青年学生，在党的鼓励、支持下，经过五个月的苦干、巧干，试制成功了我国第一台三百瓩单相工频整流子牵引电动机。西南农学院蚕桑系三年级学生敢想敢干，不仅创造了一年养蚕十次的新纪录，而且在设备简陋、技术很差的条件下，缫出了质量达到六A级的生丝。今天，高等学校的青年学生，已成为我国科学战线上的一支重要力量。
