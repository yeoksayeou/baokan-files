    Grasp Comprehensively, Emphasize Key Points, Distinguish Between Primary and Secondary, Organically Combine
    Xichong County’s Spring Production Achieves Clear Objectives
    (Reported by our newspaper) The Xichong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in the spring production movement, utilized the leadership method of "grasping comprehensively, emphasizing key points, distinguishing between primary and secondary, organically combining." The entire county's spring production movement has formed a situation of one flag flying high and ten thousand flags striving forward. The concluding work of winter production is progressing rapidly, small spring management is gradually deepening, and the spring sowing preparation work is in full swing, forming a situation of continued leap forward.
    Not long ago, the Xichong County Committee conducted an analysis and research on how to achieve a better and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960. It believed that there are many favorable conditions this year and that a full year of complete success is entirely possible. However, winter production has not yet been completely concluded, the field management of small spring (overwintering crops) is at a crucial period, and the preparatory work for big spring (spring sowing crops) must be started as early as possible. In addition, there are other tasks, so the task is very heavy; and whether these tasks are completed well or not is related to whether a comprehensive leap forward can be achieved this year. Therefore, the County Committee believes that at this critical period of transition from winter production to spring production, leadership methods must be improved to adapt to the needs of the current work. The County Committee first summarized the experience of last year's small spring bumper harvest: focusing on a high-yield command point of one thousand jin per mu, moving ahead step by step, and demonstrating and practicing section by section, resulting in driving the entire county's 200,000 mu of wheat to an average yield of 452 jin per mu, with an increase of 1.5 times; it also summarized the experience of last year's big and small spring fifteen kinds of crops achieving good harvests, mainly based on the planting habits and foundation of various crops, determining what to focus on? What to drive? What to emphasize? As a result, rice, wheat, and sweet potatoes were grasped, achieving a bumper harvest despite severe disasters; small spring miscellaneous grains were also driven, achieving multiple increases in production; cotton and oil crops, which originally had a relatively weak production base, also increased production by nearly two times.
    Based on the summary of experience, the County Committee decided that the current "tightly grasp comprehensively, emphasize key points, distinguish between primary and secondary, organically combine" leadership method must be adopted. And according to the spirit of "one step proactive, every step proactive," the entire rural work was comprehensively arranged. In order to both grasp the points and the surface, and achieve a combination of points and surface, the task force was first implemented: First, according to the instructions of the District Committee, it was decided to "firmly grasp one spring (small spring), two early crops (early rice, early corn), and solve the annual food ration" as the central task for February. Because this is the opening battle, the victory or defeat of the first battle can affect the whole year, and all efforts must be concentrated to ensure a successful start. Second, in the preparation work for spring sowing, it was decided to focus on water and fertilizer. Because "fertilizer takes the lead, and fertilizer guarantees grain" is the key to increasing production, it must be thoroughly grasped; at the same time, according to the situation that Xichong has not had heavy rain for more than half a year and the current drought is becoming increasingly serious, it is necessary to pay attention to conserving and storing water and saving water. Third, the various big spring crops were also divided into primary and secondary. The yield of sweet potatoes has always accounted for more than 70% of the total grain output, which is a large agricultural crop with a good foundation and planting habits among the masses. This year, it is necessary to grasp it particularly prominently and strive for high yields per mu. Another example is corn, which is changing from small-area planting to large-area planting this year, and is also listed as one of the key tasks. With the implementation of task alignment, the points, surface, primary and secondary become clearer, and then troops are deployed accordingly, concentrating superior forces on the main attack line; at the same time, "focusing on key points on every front, setting up on-site demonstrations in every commune and team" is adopted, so that the points lead the surface, the surface catches up with the points, the points demonstrate, and the overall level is improved. As a result, a mass movement of learning from, catching up with, helping, and surpassing naturally formed within each front. In the county's large-scale work of one spring and two early crops and spring plowing preparation, the Party committees at all levels also adopted the method of grasping small spring and big spring together, and managing production and life at the same time, so that small spring, big spring, and life are organically combined, and the work in all aspects achieves multiple benefits with one effort.
    After adopting the above-mentioned leadership methods, the work on each front is making rapid progress, and the upsurge of spring production is rising wave after wave. Under the slogan of "start early, be ruthless, link the chains tightly, and don't let go of every second," the people of the county have already made outstanding achievements. To date, an average of about 20,000 jin of fertilizer has been accumulated per mu; more than 6,000 river dams have been intercepted and reinforced, and more than 200 leaking ponds and reservoirs have been repaired, basically achieving the goal of not losing a drop of water. In the spirit of "one early crop is a hundred early crops," this year, various places have generally started seedling cultivation and sowing one season earlier. Up to now, the county has cultivated more than 20 million jin of sweet potato seedlings. While carrying out spring sowing preparations in full swing, the County Committee is still focusing its efforts on grasping small spring management. Recently, mass rallies of tens of thousands of people have been held at all levels, and a mass movement of "remote areas catching up with bumper harvest areas" has been launched throughout the county, requiring every small spring crop to catch up with high yields and learn from high yields. The first spring irrigation of 210,000 mu of wheat has been completed; seven communes in the county have achieved first-class seedling conversion, and the remaining communes are continuously strengthening management and learning from these model pacesetters.

    抓紧全面　突击重点　分清主次　有机结合
    西充县春季生产纲举目张
    本报讯　中共四川西充县县委，在春季生产运动中，运用了“抓紧全面，突击重点，分清主次，有机结合”的领导方法，全县春季生产运动，形成了一旗高举，万旗争先的局面。冬季生产的扫尾工作进行的很快，小春管理逐步深入，春播准备工作热浪滔滔，一个继续跃进的局面已经形成。
    不久以前，西充县委对1960年如何更好更全面跃进的问题，作了分析研究，认为今年有利条件很多，完全能够再来一个全年满堂红。但是冬季生产还没有完全结束，小春（越冬作物）田间管理正是关键时期，大春（春播作物）备耕工作必须及早动手，再加上其他的工作，任务很重；而这些工作任务完成的好坏，又关系到今年能否全面跃进的问题。因此，县委认为在这个由冬季生产转入春季生产的关键时期，必须改进领导方法，才能适应当前工作的需要。县委首先总结了去年小春大丰收的经验是：突出地抓好了一个亩产千斤的高产指挥点，步步走在前面，段段示范实习，结果带动全县二十万亩小麦亩产四百五十二斤，增产达一点五倍；同时也总结了去年大、小春十五种作物样样丰收的经验，主要是根据各种作物种植习惯和基础，确定重点抓什么？带动什么？突击什么？结果稻、麦、红苕抓起来了，取得了重灾保丰收；大小春杂粮也带起来了，获得了成倍增产；原来生产基础比较薄弱的棉花、油料也增产将近两倍。
    在总结经验的基础上，县委决定当前必须采取“紧抓全面，突击重点，主次分清，有机结合”的领导方法。并根据“一步主动，步步主动”的精神，全面安排了整个农村工作。为了既抓点，又抓面，做到点面结合，首先实行了任务站队：第一，根据地委指示精神，决定以“狠抓一春（小春）、两早（早稻、早玉米），解决全年口粮”，作为2月份的中心任务。因为这是开头一仗，头仗胜负可以影响全年，必须集中全力，确保旗开得胜。第二，春播准备工作中，决定以水肥为主。因为“肥料挂帅，以肥保粮”是增产的关键，必须彻底抓住；同时根据西充大半年未落透雨，当前旱象日趋严重情况，必须重视保水蓄水、节约用水。第三，对各种大春作物也分别了主次。红苕产量历来占粮食总产量的70％以上，这是农作物的大宗，基础较好，群众有种植习惯，今年更要抓得特别突出，力争亩亩高产。又如玉米，今年是改小面积种植为大面积种植，也列为重点任务之一。实行了任务排队，点面主次更加眉目清楚，然后按此调兵遣将，把优势兵力集中在主攻线上；同时采取“条条战线搞重点，社社队队摆现场”，使其以点带面，以面赶点，点点示范，全面提高。这样作的结果，很自然地在各条战线内部形成了一个学、赶、帮、超的群众运动。在全县大搞一春两早和春耕准备工作中，各级党委又采取了小春大春一齐抓，生产生活同时管的方法，使小春、大春、生活都有机地结合起来，各方面的工作做到了一举几得。
    采取上述领导方法以后，各个战线的工作都在突飞猛进，春季生产的热潮，浪浪高涨。全县人民在“早字开头，狠字下手，环环扣紧，分秒不放”的口号下，已经作出了突出的成绩。至目前止，平均每亩已积造肥料两万斤左右；已拦扎河堰六千多座，修整漏塘漏库二百多座，基本上做到了滴水不失。本着“一早百早”的精神，今年各地普遍提早了一个季节育苗下种，到现在止全县已育红薯二千多万斤。在热火朝天大搞春播准备的同时，县委仍然以极大的精力，大抓小春管理，最近层层开了万人誓师大会，在全县开展了“偏僻地区赶丰产片”的群众运动，要块块小春作物赶高产，向高产看齐，二十一万亩小麦已全部完成第一次春灌；全县已有七个公社实现一类苗化，其余公社正在不断加强管理，向这些标兵看齐。
