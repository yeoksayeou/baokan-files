    "Obscured by a single leaf, one cannot see Mount Tai." This old saying aptly describes those who only see the waves in the rolling, eastward-flowing river, but fail to see the main current and fundamental trends; those who lose their direction in the midst of great storms. "Autumn known by a single leaf," on the other hand, is a warning to those who are keenly perceptive and good at discerning the direction of the wind. After each rectification movement, every revolutionary deeply feels that in the struggle of the revolution and construction, how to firmly stand our ground, discern the wind direction, achieve "autumn known by a single leaf," and not be misled by evil winds and noxious influences, is a very important issue.

    When the autumn wind comes, leaves fall. In social life, just like in nature, we often encounter storms. These political storms, with the ups and downs of the class struggle situation, include breezes that "rise from the tip of the green shoot" and gales that "howl at the creek." There is never a time of absolute calm. Looking at the facts of the last two or three years, even revolutionaries often have different performances in each storm, especially in big storms. Some people, when a gentle breeze blows down leaves, can foresee the situation, and with a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, see through the signs of all kinds of "demonic auras" and "evil influences." When dark clouds gather and reactionary currents attack us like a typhoon, they firmly hold high the red flag of revolution, dare to go against the tide, and withstand the adverse wind. They are worthy of being the vanguards of the era, the "pillars" in the revolutionary struggle. A small number of people also have varying degrees of wavering, swaying and staggering, like weeds on the wall, blown by the wind, needing others to help them several times before they can stand firm. Others, when the fallen leaves blown down by a gentle breeze are reflected in their eyes, are obscured from seeing the vast river flowing eastward. They regard the temporarily rising waves as everything, and are thus engulfed by reactionary political whirlpools.

    The tempering of political storms makes the vast majority of people more and more steadfast, but some people have made mistakes, large or small, in the great storms. They still have not found the root cause of their mistakes, or the way to correct them. Instead, they wrongly blame social life for "having storms," for "not being calm," and for "not being good." Therefore, they fantastically hope that social life can be "calm and tranquil," or seek "havens" and "utopias" to escape political struggles. It must be said that this is a petty-bourgeois fantasy. The tree desires calm, but the wind will not stop. The struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat is long-term and permeates all social spheres. As long as class struggle exists, it is impossible to have "calm and tranquil" conditions, and there is simply no "haven" that can be separated from social life. In order to seriously and correctly accept the lessons of experience, we must first abandon this fantasy of escaping reality, criticize the pessimistic emotions of these philistines who are frightened by the storm, and strive to study and train ourselves so that when the "wind suddenly rises," we can see clearly and know autumn from a single leaf; and in the raging waves, be as steadfast as the rocks standing in the ocean.

    The wind in social life, like the falling leaves in nature, is not elusive and ethereal, but can be grasped in its essence through phenomena, and the wind direction can be judged. The same "leaf," for different people, can either be confused by it or "know autumn." It can be seen that the key does not lie in the social phenomenon itself, but in people's views on these social phenomena, first of all, in people's overall view of things, that is, the question of world outlook.

    Why do some people become "obscured by a single leaf" and make all kinds of distorted and extremely wrong judgments about the objective world? This is mainly because their world view has not yet been resolved. "All human actions are guided by human ideology. And everyone has his own outlook on life and world outlook to serve as the overall guidance for all his thoughts and actions" (Liu Shaoqi). Standing on the narrow, selfish, and reactionary position of the bourgeoisie, and viewing problems with a metaphysical and idealistic world view, will inevitably lead to all kinds of distortions of objective things, because this world view is anti-scientific and violates the objective laws of the development of things. Only by standing on the proletarian, selfless position, and viewing problems with a dialectical materialist world view, can we correctly understand the world, because this world view is completely scientific and reflects the objective laws of the development of things. Some people foresee changes in the weather because of a single leaf, while others are blocked from seeing the bigger picture by a single leaf and completely lose their way. The fundamental reason for such a big difference lies in their diametrically opposed world views. This shows that if a person wants to avoid being confused by any superficial and temporary phenomena, and keenly discern the wind direction, he must establish a firm proletarian world view, thoroughly break with bourgeois ideology, viewpoints, and habits, resolutely overcome individualistic thinking, and treat all things from the proletarian viewpoint. No matter who it is, the more firm the proletarian stand, the more clear the proletarian viewpoint, the more correctly they can understand reality, the more keenly they can smell, and the better they can discern the wind direction. Similarly, as long as one is slightly infected with the poisonous bacteria of bourgeois ideology, one will suffer from a political cold in the storms of revolutionary struggle. This can be said to be a theorem.

    The wind in political life is not only divided into large and small, but also into headwind and tailwind, right wind and wrong wind, gentle breeze and evil wind. The wind that represents the proletarian socialist force and promotes social development is the right wind, and it is also the gentle breeze that allows new forces to bloom; the wind that represents the decadent forces of the bourgeoisie is the headwind, and it is the evil wind that destroys new forces. The various phenomena in political storms, especially the various signs when the "wind suddenly rises," are often not easy to distinguish. This requires us, as Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "We must look at its essence when we look at things, and only regard its phenomena as guides to enter the door. Once we enter the door, we must grasp its essence. This is a reliable scientific analysis method." To achieve a true understanding of complex social phenomena from the outside to the inside, to discard the false and preserve the true, and to reveal their essence, we must use the basic viewpoint of Marxism, that is, the method of class analysis, in observing things. The Marxist method of class analysis enables people to determine in complex social struggles which classes are the revolutionary leading forces, which classes are the revolutionary allies, which classes are the objects of the revolution, and their development trends and changes in the struggle. In class society, all kinds of ideas are branded with the mark of class. What one supports, what one opposes, one's joy, anger, and sorrow are all reflections of a certain class viewpoint. For all kinds of arguments, opinions, slogans, and propositions, if we do not analyze them with the method of class analysis, we cannot see which are the well-intentioned criticisms of revolutionary comrades, and which are the attacks and slanders of the enemy; and if we cannot judge right from wrong, we cannot see which are the demands representing the direction of the advance of new forces, and which are the mourning of the declining and decadent forces. Some people believe in the materials they hear from others and the opinions of relatives and friends at home, without looking at who said them and which class's opinions they reflect, and they regard them as the basis, which often leads to wrong judgments. This is a clear example.

    Some people think that the method of class analysis is "outdated" and want us to discard this sharp weapon in order to confuse the masses. This is what we absolutely cannot do. Whether analyzing international or domestic issues, we cannot leave class analysis, otherwise it will be "a blind man riding a blind horse, approaching a deep pool in the middle of the night," and we will not get good results. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art: "It is necessary to study the various classes in society, study their interrelationships and various conditions, study their faces and their psychology." This is what every comrade must always pay attention to, because only in this way can we be able to discern the wind direction.

    Since the storms in political life are a reflection of class struggle, various winds cannot be separated from social life and the practice of revolutionary struggle of the masses. The birth and growth of new things in society must go through a great uproar, and must go through a serious struggle with the old things to be realized. The struggle between the new things that have just been born in the revolutionary mass movement and the old things that hinder their development will inevitably be reflected in the struggle of political and ideological viewpoints, forming the storms in political life. If you do not believe in the infinite creativity of the broad masses of people, detach yourself from the practice of the revolutionary struggle of the masses, and shut yourself in a small house without seeing the world, even if you have good wishes, you will not know what the revolutionary mass movement that is rising and surging is going to destroy, what new things the mass movement has created, what are the horns of victory for the new things, and what are the dirges of the dying old things; what is the mainstream of the great mass movement, and what are just some waves. Losing the foundation in this way, it is easy to see problems like a kite with a broken string, drifting with the air, and it is impossible to discern the wind direction at all. All winds are inseparable from the struggle of the masses. To "know autumn by a single leaf," we must firmly believe in the creativity of the masses, always be with the masses, share the same fate with the masses, and actively participate in the practice of revolutionary struggle of the masses. At the same time, the fire of the revolutionary struggle of the masses is also the best furnace for curing "colds" and exercising political smell.

    To be good at discerning the wind direction, we must also seriously study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong to arm our minds. In leading the Chinese revolutionary struggle, Chairman Mao has always been a brilliant example of keenly discerning the situation, identifying the wind direction, and pointing out the direction for the people with rare scientific foresight. He will always be our role model. It is difficult to give a detailed introduction to Comrade Mao Zedong's deeds in this regard. Here are just two familiar examples. When the First Revolutionary Civil War failed and reactionary rule covered the sky like dark clouds, some people became pessimistic, but Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "A single spark can start a prairie fire"; predicting that the high tide of the Chinese revolution was about to arrive, "It is a ship standing on the coast, already seeing the tip of the mast in the sea, it is a round of red sun standing on the top of the mountain, already seeing the light shining in the east, about to burst out, it is a baby about to mature in the mother's womb." Now, socialist New China is riding the wind and waves forward, radiating brilliant light like the sun. History has fully proved the astonishing accuracy of Chairman Mao's predictions. In the second half of 1955, some people once thought that the cooperative developed too fast and should be resolutely reduced and resolutely "dismounted." The great helmsman Comrade Mao Zedong, who was good at identifying the wind direction, quickly pointed out that the people who were blowing this wind were standing on the position of the bourgeoisie, the rich peasants, or the well-to-do middle peasants with spontaneous capitalist tendencies, and they were trying to prevent the development of agricultural cooperation. Comrade Mao Zedong accurately judged that a large-scale socialist upsurge of more than 500 million rural people with extremely great world significance was about to arrive across the country, and pointed out that the three poor peasants in Nanwangzhuang, Anping County, Hebei Province, who insisted on running cooperatives, were the "direction of 500 million peasants" in the country. Now, people can clearly see that this scientific genius's prediction has long become a glorious reality. As the great revolutionary helmsman, Comrade Mao Zedong is very good at discovering things that have just emerged on the horizon, timely identifying the wind direction, and leading the whole party to stand firmly at the forefront of the revolutionary struggle, leaping from one victory to another.

    There are often signs of wind and grass. We must be good at accepting the experiences and lessons of past great storms, seriously study Marxism-Leninism, study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, firmly establish the proletarian world view, stand firm on the proletarian position, and often observe the situation with the method of class analysis. Not only do we stand still in the face of evil winds and adverse currents, but also strive to learn to improve our ability to discern the wind direction, to be able to "know autumn by a single leaf," and to try our best to avoid being "obscured by a single leaf and not knowing Mount Tai."

### “一叶障目”和“一叶知秋”

    “一叶障目”和“一叶知秋”
    侯铁萍
    “一叶障目，不识泰山”。这句古话，描写一些只看到滚滚东流大江中的浪花，看不到主流和根本趋势，在大风浪中失掉方向的人，是很适当的。而“一叶知秋”，则是描写一些嗅觉锐敏、善于辨别风向的人的一个警语。经过历次整风运动，我们每个革命者，都深深感到在革命和建设事业的斗争中，如何坚定地站稳立场，辨别风向，做到“一叶知秋”，而不为妖风邪风所迷惑，是一个很重要的问题。
    秋风来，树叶落。在社会生活中，同自然界一样，也经常遇到风浪。这种政治风浪，随着阶级斗争形势的起伏发展，有“起于青苹之末”的微风，也有“呼号于溪口”的狂风，绝对平静的时候，是没有的。从近两三年的事实看，在每次风浪中，特别是大风大浪中，即使革命者也常常有不同的表现。一部分人，在微风吹起落叶的时候，可以预察形势，以高度的革命警惕，识破种种“妖氛”、“邪气”的苗头；在一时阴云密布、反动逆流像台风一样向我们冲击的时候，坚定地高举革命的红旗，敢于反潮流，顶逆风。他们不愧为时代的尖兵，革命斗争中的“中流砥柱”。也有一小部分人，有程度不同的摇摆，晃晃悠悠，东倒西歪，好像墙头草一样随风飘荡，需要别人扶几次，帮几把，才能站稳脚跟。另有少数人，在微风吹掉的落叶反映在他们眼帘的时候，就遮住了视野，根本看不到滚滚东去的大江，而把暂时翻起的浪花当做一切，从而被反动的政治漩涡所卷没。
    政治风浪的锻炼，使绝大多数人愈来愈坚定，但是也有人在大风浪中犯了或大或小的错误，仍然没有找出犯错误的根源，找出纠正错误的途径，反而错误地怪罪社会生活中“有风浪”，“不平静”，“不好处”。因此，他们异想天开地希望社会生活能够“风平浪静”，或者寻求逃避政治斗争的“避风港”、“世外桃源”。应当说，这是一种小资产阶级的幻想。树欲静而风不停。资产阶级同无产阶级的斗争是长期的，也是充满一切社会领域的。只要阶级斗争存在，就不可能“风平浪静”，也根本没有什么可以脱离社会生活的“避风港”。为要认真地正确地接受经验教训，首先，必须抛弃这种逃避现实的幻想，批判这种被风暴吓破了胆的庸人的悲观情绪，而去努力学习锻炼，锻炼得自己在“风乍起”的时候，能够明察秋毫，一叶知秋；在惊涛骇浪中，像海洋中屹立的岩石一样坚定。
    社会生活中的风，同自然界风吹叶落一样，不是捉摸不定，虚无缥缈的，而是可以透过现象把握它的本质，判明风向的。同样的“一叶”，不同的人，有的可以被它所迷惑，有的可以“知秋”。可见，关键不在社会现象的本身，而在于人们对于这些社会现象的看法，首先在于人们对事物的总看法，也就是世界观问题。
    为什么一些人“一叶障目”，对客观世界做出种种歪曲和极端错误的判断呢？这主要是因为他们的世界观问题还没有解决。“人的一切行动，都是有人的思想意识来作指导的。而每一个人又有他的人生观与世界观来作他一切思想行动的总的指导”（刘少奇）。站在资产阶级狭隘自私的反动立场上，用形而上学的唯心主义的世界观看问题，必然对客观事物做出种种歪曲，因为这种世界观是反科学的，违反了事物发展的客观规律。只有站在无产阶级大公无私的立场上，用辩证唯物主义的世界观看问题，才能正确地认识世界，因为这种世界观是完全科学的，反映了事物发展的客观规律。有的人因一叶而预知天气的变化，有的人因一叶而挡住了视线，完全迷失了方向，所以会有这样大的差别，根本原因就在于他们的世界观是截然相反的。这就说明，一个人要不为任何表面的暂时的现象所迷惑，锐敏地辨别风向，就必须树立坚定的无产阶级世界观，彻底同资产阶级思想、观点和习惯决裂，坚决克服个人主义思想，以无产阶级的观点对待一切事物。不管任何人，无产阶级的立场愈坚定，无产阶级的观点愈明确，就越能够正确地认识现实，嗅觉锐敏，善于辨别风向。同样，只要在思想上稍微沾染上资产阶级思想的毒菌，就会在革命斗争的风浪中患政治上的伤风病。这可以说是个定理。
    政治生活中的风，不仅有大小之分，也有顺风和逆风、正风和歪风、和风和妖风的区别。代表无产阶级社会主义力量，促进社会发展之风，是正风，也是使新生力量百花齐放的和风；代表资产阶级腐朽势力之风，是逆风，是摧残新生力量的妖风。政治风浪中的种种现象，特别是“风乍起”时候的种种征候，常常不容易辨清。这就必须如毛泽东同志所教导的那样：“我们看事情必须要看它的实质，而把它的现象只看作入门的向导，一进了门就要抓住它的实质，这才是可靠的科学的分析方法。”而要作到对于复杂的社会现象从表及里，去伪存真，揭露其本质，就必须在观察事物中运用马克思主义的基本观点，即阶级分析的方法。马克思主义的阶级分析的方法，使人们在复杂的社会斗争中能够判明哪些阶级是革命的领导力量，哪些阶级是革命的同盟军，哪些阶级是革命的对象，以及他们在斗争中的发展趋势和变化。在阶级社会里，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印，拥护什么，反对什么，喜怒哀乐，都是一定阶级观点的反映。对于各种议论、意见、口号和主张，如果不用阶级分析的方法来分析，就不能看出哪些是革命同志的善意批评，哪些是敌人的攻击和污蔑；而不能判明是非，就不能看清哪些是代表新生力量前进方向的要求，哪些是代表衰落、腐朽势力的哀鸣。有些人对一些道听途说的材料，家中亲友的意见，丝毫不看是什么人说的，反映哪个阶级的意见，就信以为真，当做根据，往往铸成错误判断，就是一个明显的例证。
    有些人认为阶级分析的方法“过时了”，要我们丢掉这个锋利的武器，以利于他们迷惑群众，这是我们绝对不能干的。无论分析国际或国内问题，都不能离开阶级分析，否则就是“盲人骑瞎马，夜半临深池”，不会得到好结果。毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话中指出：“要研究社会上的各个阶级，研究它们的相互关系和各个状况，研究它们的面貌和它们的心理。”这是我们每个同志必须经常注意的，因为只有这样，才能够做到辨别风向。
    政治生活中的风浪，既然是阶级斗争的反映，那么，各种风就不可能离开社会生活，离开群众革命斗争的实践。社会上新生事物的诞生和成长，都要经过一场大喊大叫，都必然要经过同旧事物的严重斗争才能实现。刚刚在革命群众运动中诞生出来的新生事物，同阻碍它发展的旧事物的斗争，必然反映为政治、思想观点的斗争，形成政治生活中的风浪。不相信广大人民群众无穷无尽的创造力，脱离群众革命斗争的实践，关在小房子里不见世面，即使你有善良的愿望，也不可能知道什么是风起云涌的革命群众运动要摧毁的东西，群众运动创造了什么新生事物，哪些是新生事物要胜利的号角，哪些是旧事物垂死挣扎的哀歌；什么是伟大群众运动的主流，哪些只是一些浪花。这样失掉了根基，看问题就必然容易像断了线的风筝一样，随空气飘荡，根本不可能辨清风向。一切风，都离不开群众斗争。要“一叶知秋”，就必须坚定地相信群众的创造力，时时刻刻同群众一道，与群众同呼吸共命运，积极参加群众革命斗争的实践。同时，群众革命斗争的烈火，也是医治“伤风病”、锻炼政治嗅觉的最好的熔炉。
    要善于辨风向，还必须认真学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东同志的著作，以武装自己的头脑。毛主席在领导中国革命斗争中，始终是以惊人的机敏洞察形势，识别风向，以罕有的科学预见，为人民指出方向的光辉典范。他永远是我们学习的榜样。详尽地介绍毛泽东同志在这方面的事迹是困难的。这里只举两件大家熟知的例子。当第一次国内革命战争失败，反动统治像乌云一样布满天空的时候，有些人产生了悲观情绪，而毛泽东同志却指出：“星星之火，可以燎原”；预言中国革命高潮快要到来，“它是站在海岸遥望海中已经看得见桅杆尖头了的一只航船，它是立于高山之巅远看东方已见光芒四射喷薄欲出的一轮朝日，它是躁动于母腹中的快要成熟了的一个婴儿”。现在，社会主义的新中国正在乘风破浪前进，像太阳一样放射着万丈光辉。历史完全证明了毛主席预见的惊人准确。在1955年下半年，曾经有人认为合作社发展得太快了，要坚决收缩，坚决“下马”。善于识别风向的伟大舵手毛泽东同志十分迅速地指出，刮这股风的人，是站在资产阶级、富农、或者具有资本主义自发倾向的富裕中农的立场上，是要阻止农业合作化的发展。毛泽东同志准确地判断出，具有极其伟大的世界意义的五亿多农村人口的大规模的社会主义高潮在全国即将到来，指出坚持办合作社的河北省安平县南王庄的三户贫农，是全国“五亿农民的方向”。现在，人们都清楚地看到，这个科学的天才的预见，早已变成光辉的现实。作为伟大革命舵手的毛泽东同志，十分善于发现地平线上刚刚露头的东西，及时辨别风向，领导全党坚定地站在革命斗争的前列，从一个胜利跃进到另一个胜利。
    风吹草动常常有。我们必须善于接受历次大风浪中的经验教训，认真学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东同志的著作，坚定地树立无产阶级的世界观，站稳无产阶级立场，经常用阶级分析的方法观察形势，不仅做到在歪风逆流中屹立不动，而且努力学习提高辨别风向的本领，能够“一叶知秋”，而竭力避免“一叶障目，不识泰山”。
