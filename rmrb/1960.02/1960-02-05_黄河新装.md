	6. A Tour of the Tunnels

	If you want to go into the tunnels, it's best to go now. Because after the cutoff, it will become the new riverbed. The Yellow River is unwilling to make way for anyone.

	I don't know how many workers have sweated here. Now, replacing the river in the tunnels is a flow of people, a never-ending torrent of humanity.

	When the excavator is working, the bulldozer stops. Trucks shuttle back and forth, loaded with ballast, the deafening electric horn sounds continuously, along a circular route, loaded with ballast at the intake, and then driven out of the three branch tunnels and dumped into the river.

	There are distribution panels at the entrances of the three branch tunnels, indicating that this is the hub of electricity. On the rocks at the entrance of the tunnel, a slogan for fighting for 3,800 cubic meters is pasted.

	Only on the ground in the second branch tunnel is there a gurgling stream, giving the impression that one can walk into an underground ocean along this path. However, don't be afraid, the other parts are made of high-quality, watertight rock. Moreover, this water is also necessary; it is most convenient to use it to wash the rubble for filling.

	This tunnel is also a well-organized underground mixing plant.

	From the other end of the tunnel, sand, pebbles, and cement are constantly transported in: cement is carried in wooden boxes, sand and pebbles are pulled in by carts. They work rhythmically according to a certain time and a certain ratio. Cement can be directly poured onto the belt conveyor, but those carts must go through the weighing scale and then be pulled to the material platform. The springboard of the material platform is not flat, so they must rush up like a gust of wind, turn around, perhaps five or six people, and then work together to raise the cart towards the sky, pull open the baffle, and the aggregate will fall beside the belt conveyor.

	Two point-five mixers are close together like a pair of sisters. Every ten minutes a groove is poured out, the groove facing downwards, and dump trucks are waiting below.

	The dump truck moves forward, and there is another belt conveyor. The belt conveyor carries the mixed concrete to the high altitude. On the high-altitude架子 (jia zi, scaffolding), countless small carts transport it along a certain route into the formwork near the arch.

	In addition to dump trucks, there are also small carts, which are pulled from the manual mixing plant; but they also participate in this great procession. Therefore, this is an amazing organization, countless people, and various different vehicles must work in the same rhythm.

	The command post is located in the second branch tunnel. A female technician asked for the cross-sectional drawing of the intake on the phone. The old captain, because the material supply could not keep up, suppressed the female technician's phone call and loudly expressed his opinions. In a corner, a battery is being charged. The walls are covered with daily changing forms. The door is always open, and countless sounds are transmitted in. Among these bizarre sounds, a girl crisply said to the doctor who had just entered: "Doctor, come and drink water. Look how good and clear our water is." The water of the Yellow River is not clear; but this water is indeed as sweet as her voice. This is what I saw in the command post.

	At this time, the Party Committee Secretary of the Bureau came to the underground mixing plant to inspect the work. Everything was proceeding as usual; but the secretary is a person who is never satisfied, and he demanded that the rhythm be faster and more even. So he followed the process, like an experienced doctor, first using a watch to calculate the time for adding aggregates, and then pointing out that the sand should be spread out on the material platform so that the pebbles would not slip on the belt conveyor. He stood beside the dump truck, saw that it was not appropriate to use a shovel to unload the concrete, but a pickaxe should be used, and he personally found two pickaxes from the tool pile. It seems like a small matter, but it is so important because a pickaxe brings higher efficiency than a shovel. Finally, he came to the mixer, and his sharp eyes said without hesitation: "That's right, the crux I'm looking for is here." The way of pulling the shovel is wrong. It affects the feeding at the back and the pouring at the front. The workers do not have long rubber boots, which is also one of the reasons that hinders movement. Rubber boots were immediately sent for, and the work method had to be corrected immediately. In the laughter of the girl who asked the doctor to drink water, another important reform was quietly completed in the tunnel.

	The two mixers are like pavilions built in the air, standing still; but the formwork and the scaffolding for pouring are extending forward day and night, as if they have legs, they want to walk to the intake.

	The lower part of the intake must also be poured with the bottom plate, and the rocks outside must continue to be excavated. No work is not carried out in parallel.

	The smoke from the blasting in the tunnel has long dissipated; but the green smoke from the excavators and cars has condensed like fog again.

	This is a sea of smoke.

	The roaring sound of the Yellow River is deafening, what about in the tunnel? The sound of the mixer, the sound of the excavator gnawing stones, bursts of car horns, and the sizzling sound of electric welding... This is also a sea of sounds, the roaring sound of the Yellow River has long been deafened.

	The tunnel has become another world, as if there is thunder all day long, and the blue flame of electric welding is like lightning in the sky.

	The tunnel is also a large melting pot, because no matter which type of work, or engineers and those on duty, as soon as they enter the tunnel, they become a whole. They have different work posts, but the goal is the same. The mixer urges you, and the cars chase you like meteors. You become one of the links, and you cannot stop. Not only is the machine moving, but the air ducts are also trembling. If you put your hand on the scaffolding, it is also moving. If you walk slowly, the push bar of the car behind you will touch your chest, warning you to stand in your ranks. If you are a visitor, and you see two people carrying a wooden board in front, you can boldly bend down and crawl under the wooden board, or stretch out your shoulders and carry the wooden board forward with them.

	Even if the sounds and smoke are mixed together, a foreman can find the person he is looking for without error. Precisely because this sound is rich in rhythm, an experienced leader can know everything by it, even know where an accident has occurred.

	The outlet is a focal point. The excavator is like a guard blocking the door, humming, panting, and constantly digging. Next to it are two dump trucks, occupying the entire opening; but you can walk there with confidence, and when you get there, you will know that there is always a newly opened path to climb up. At this time, you are standing on the grass and soil embankment, and you can see the Yellow River flowing under your feet. The river water, illuminated by the sun, its light waves like countless cunning eyes, are spying on the secrets of this construction team.

	At this time, after a tour of the tunnel, everyone will find that they are covered with cement, straw, oil stains... These are what you picked up from the workers, and if you originally had these things on you, others might also pick them up from you. Now everyone is the same, because everyone comes out of this whole. Only when you go home and change your clothes can you see who is the driller and who is the concrete pourer.

	It is best to exit the tunnel from the third branch tunnel. If it is at night, as soon as you come out of the entrance, the two searchlights hanging down from the opposite mountain wall will make you think that these are two moons suspended in the sky, illuminating the扶梯 (fu ti, handrail/escalator) leading to the underground factory... That's right, the underground factory is on the opposite hillside. The workers who used to dig the tunnels have started the second great project there. They were drilled in from three entrances. If there is blasting, and the smoke comes out from all three entrances at the same time, then you will see a real miracle similar to a volcanic eruption. [End]

    六　隧洞巡礼
    要到隧洞里去，最好现在就去。因为截流之后，它就变成了新的河道。黄河的水是不肯为人让路的。
    不知多少工人，在这里流过汗。现在隧洞里代替河流的是人流，这是一支永不断头的人的洪流。
    当挖掘机工作的时候，推土机就停下来了。汽车一辆一辆地穿梭而过，它们装满了石碴，一连声地响着震耳的电笛，沿着一条循环路线，由进水口装上石碴，再由三支洞走出倒进河里。
    三支洞洞口有配电盘，说明这里是电的枢纽。洞口的岩石上，贴着一张为三千八百方而战斗的标语。
    唯有二支洞地上，有潺潺的流水，使人觉得顺着这条路可以走进地下海洋一般。不过，不要怕，其他部分都是滴水不漏的上好岩石。而且这些流水也是必要的，用它来洗填充用的毛石最方便不过。
    这个隧洞，还是一座组织严密的地下拌合场。
    从隧洞的那一头，砂子、卵石和水泥不断地运来：水泥是用木箱子抬来的，砂子和卵石是用小车拉来的。它们按照一定的时间，一定的比例，有节奏的工作着。水泥可以直接倒在皮带机上，那些小车却得走过磅秤，然后再拉到料台上。料台的跳板不是平的，因此他们必需像一阵风似的冲上来，掉转头，也许五个人，也许六个人，再一起用力把车朝天竖起，拉开挡板，砂石料才会倒在皮带机旁边。
    两台零点五的拌合机，像一双姊妹一样紧挨着。每隔十分钟倒出一槽子，槽口向下，自卸卡车就在下面等着。
    自卸卡车向前走去，又是皮带机。皮带机把拌好的混凝土带向高空，在高空的架子上，有无数的小推车沿着一定的路线，把它送进接近拱顶的模板里。
    除了自卸卡车，还有小拉车，它是从人工拌合场拉来的；但是它也参加了这个伟大的行列。因此，这是一个惊人的组织，无数的人，各种不同的车辆，必需在同一节拍下工作。
    指挥部设在二支洞。一个女技术员在电话里要进水口的断面图。那位老队长为了料供不上，压下了女技术员打电话的声音，大声地发表议论。一个角落上，在给电瓶充电。墙上挂满了日日变化着的表格。门永远开着，无数的声音传了进来。在这千奇百怪的声音当中，一个女孩子清脆地向刚进来的大夫说道：“大夫，你来喝水。你看我们这水多好，多清。”黄河的水并不清；可是这水的确像她的声音一样甘美。这就是我在指挥部看见的。
    这时，局党委书记走进地下拌合场检查工作来了。一切都照常进行着；但书记是一个永远不会满足的人，他要求节拍越快越匀才好。于是他顺着工序走去，像一位有经验的医生，一会用表计算上砂石料的时间，一会又指点着要把砂子在料台上铺开，这样，卵石就不致于在皮带机上打滑了。他站在自卸卡车旁边，看见卸混凝土时不该用锹，应该用镐，他就亲自从工具堆里找出两把镐来。看起来这是小事，可是它又是这么重要，因为一把镐比一把锹带来了更高的功效。最后他又来到拌合机旁，他的锐利的眼睛，这时毫不犹疑地说：“不错，我要找的症结就在这里了。”这是拉锹的方法不对。它既影响了后边进料，又影响了前边浇筑。工人没有长统胶皮靴子，也是妨碍动作的原因之一。胶皮靴马上派人取去了，工作方法也得立即纠正。就在那个女孩子让大夫喝水的笑声中，又一次重要的改革，在隧洞里悄悄地完成了。
    那两台拌合机，像是空中筑起的楼阁，巍然不动；可是模板和浇筑用的排架，却在日夜向前伸展，它像有腿似的，要走到进水口。
    进水口下部还得浇筑底板，外面的岩石也得继续开挖，没有一样活不是交叉进行的。
    隧洞里开凿时的炮烟，早就消散了；可是挖掘机和汽车的青烟，又像雾似的凝结起来。
    这是烟雾的海。
    黄河咆哮的声音是震耳的，隧洞里呢？拌合机的声音，挖掘机啃石头的声音，一阵阵汽车喇叭声，还有电焊的呲呲声……这又是声音的海，黄河咆哮的声音早已掩耳不闻了。
    隧洞变成了另一个世界，仿佛整日都有雷鸣，而电焊的蓝色的火焰，又像天空的闪电一般。
    隧洞又是一个大的熔炉，因为不论哪个工种，也不论工程师和值班的人，一走进隧洞就变成了一个整体。他们有不同的工作岗位，目标可是一个。拌合机催着你，汽车又像流星一般追着你。你变成其中一个环节，不能停下一步。不但机械在动，风管也在颤动。如果你把手放在排架上，它也在动。如果你走慢了，后面推来的车把就会触到你的胸上，警告你站到你的行列里去。如果你是参观的人，遇见前面有两个人抬着木板，你可以大胆地弯起腰从木板底下钻过去，或者伸出肩膀同他们一起抬着木板前进。
    纵然声音和烟雾搅成一团，一个工长可以毫不错误地找到他要找的人。正因为这声音富于节奏，一个有经验的领导人，凭着它可以知道一切，甚至凭着它可以知道什么地方出了事故。
    出水口是个集中点。挖掘机像一个卫士堵在门口，哼着，喘着，不停地挖掘着。它的旁边又有两辆自卸卡车，占据了整个洞口；可是你可以放心走去，到了那里就知道永远有一条新辟的小路爬上去。这时，你站在草土围堰上了，望得见黄河就在脚下流着了。河水在太阳照耀下，它的光波像无数谲诈的眼睛，在窥测这个建设队伍的秘密。
    这时，经过隧洞的巡礼，不论谁都会发现自己身上沾满了水泥，稻草，油垢……这是你由工人身上沾来的，如果你的身上原来有这些东西，说不定别人也会沾上你的。现在大家都一样了，因为大家都是从这个整体之中走出来的。只有回了家重新换上衣服，才看得出谁是风钻工，谁又是浇筑工。
    要走出隧洞最好从三支洞走出来。如果是在夜晚，一出洞口，对面山壁上垂下来的两个探照灯，你会以为这是悬在天空的两个月亮，它照耀着走进地下厂房的扶梯……对了，地下厂房就在对面半山腰上，过去开挖隧洞的工人，又在那里开始了第二个伟大的工程。他们是由三个洞口打进去的，如果赶上放炮，硝烟由三个洞口一齐冒出来，那末你就会看到一次类似火山爆发的真正奇迹。　〔完〕
