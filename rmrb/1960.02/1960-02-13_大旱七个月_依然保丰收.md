    Seven Months of Severe Drought, Still Ensuring a Bumper Harvest
    The Chinese Communist Party Gansu Province Committee People's Commune Investigation Team
    Gansu is the province with the least rainfall in the whole country, and Dingxi Prefecture is the driest area in Gansu. The Shuiquan People's Commune is located in the eastern part of Jingyuan County, Dingxi Prefecture, where "major droughts never end, and minor droughts occur every year." Before liberation, the average yield per mu here was only twenty or thirty jin in normal years. The peasants lived a life of "half a year's food with rain, fleeing famine with little rain, and even more suffering with severe drought." Water is as precious as life here.

    1959 was the first year after communization. There was no rain in the Shuiquan area for more than seven months. However, the crops in the Shuiquan People's Commune generally grew luxuriantly, and both grain and cotton achieved unprecedented bumper harvests. The average grain yield per mu reached 246 jin, and the cotton yield per mu reached 60 jin; grain single-yield increased by 188% compared to 1957, and cotton increased by 42%. In 1959, the cotton field area expanded more than four times compared to before communization, but the total grain output still reached 11.21 million jin, an increase of more than two times compared to 1957, and an increase of 5.45% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958; the total cotton output reached 492,000 jin, an increase of about seven times compared to 1957. The whole commune presented an unprecedented prosperous scene everywhere.

    Revolutionizing Ideology, Revolutionizing Nature

    After the land reform, the Party organization accepted the demands of the masses and resolved to lead the masses to overcome drought and enable people to live a life of abundance and freedom from drought and flood. In 1953, the Party called on the masses to prevent and combat drought, and the People's Government also issued a large number of loans to build water conservancy projects. However, some people said, "Landlords can be overthrown, but can we resist the heavens?" The Party organization believed that in order to make the masses consciously act to overcome drought, it was necessary to carry out arduous ideological work in a thorough and meticulous manner. The Party sent Comrade Chang Gongmin to Sharuishui Village to do pilot work, leading the masses to find water sources and build water conservancy projects. In that year, Sharuishui Village built 348 mu of irrigated land, and the wheat yield per mu on the irrigated land reached about 300 jin. After continuous efforts in 1954 and 1955, the peasants of Sharuishui Village built more than 500 mu of irrigated land and more than 50 mu of dam land (Note 1), and laid sandy land (Note 2) on 230 mu of land where there was no spring water or flood, achieving an average of three mu of drought-resistant land per person in the whole village. In these three years, Shuiquan Township suffered severe droughts year after year, but Sharuishui Village changed from a grain-deficient village to a grain-surplus village, and every household had no worries about food and clothing.

    In the winter of 1957, the Party organization of Shuiquan Township vigorously promoted the experience of Sharuishui Village in all fourteen agricultural cooperatives in the township. The cooperative members expressed their determination to learn from Sharuishui Village, and each cooperative proposed to work hard in the winter and spring, building half a mu of irrigated land per person and laying 3,000 mu of sandy land in the whole township. The Party organization actively led the masses in the fight against drought. Shuiquan Township established a farmland water conservancy basic construction headquarters, headed by the secretary, mobilizing the whole Party, and put forward the action slogan of "Nine Transformations and One Movement," namely: transforming mountain gullies into reservoirs, mountain bays into ponds, wasteland into sandy land, dry land into irrigated land, barren mountains into forest gardens, low-yield into high-yield, grain shortage into grain surplus, poverty into prosperity, and backwardness into advancement, thereby launching a vigorous mass movement in which everyone started, everyone contributed ideas, and changed the drought situation.

    New Tasks, New Contradictions

    The transformation of production relations and the shaking of "fatalistic" thinking gave people the courage and strength to declare war on nature. However, the Shuiquan area lacks water sources, and there is little rainfall every year, and it is mostly concentrated in the autumn. On the land of more than 800 square kilometers, there are only 1,747 households with 11,959 people. Each labor force farms an average of 15 mu of land, and each draft animal farms an average of 31 mu of land. The land is vast and the population is sparse, and there is a shortage of manpower and animal power. To carry out large-scale farmland water conservancy basic construction and transform the dry mountains and dry plains into flower and fruit mountains and rice and grain plains with trees on the mountains, flowing water everywhere, freedom from drought and flood, and eternal bumper harvests, there is indeed a sharp contradiction between tasks and forces. Although the agricultural cooperatives at that time did a lot of excellent work, after all, the organizational scale was small and the scope of activities was limited. In terms of large-scale farmland water conservancy basic construction, they encountered many difficulties that were difficult to overcome.

    What to do? Some agricultural cooperatives sent people to the township Party committee to propose specific methods to solve the contradictions. They said, "If we don't merge into large cooperatives, no one can do well!" After research, the township Party committee, according to the demands of the masses, merged the fourteen agricultural cooperatives in the township into six. The agricultural cooperatives were expanded, and some problems were relatively easy to solve. For example, after the four agricultural cooperatives of Dayingshui, Wanjiamiao, Shibeizi, and Huangmaogou merged into one cooperative, they built a reservoir in the spring of 1958 that could irrigate 3,000 mu of land. When the first flood came down, the reservoir intercepted the flood and irrigated more than 800 mu of land, and the masses were in high spirits. However, each agricultural cooperative had to continue to build water conservancy projects and engage in field management. In terms of labor, tools, funds, and technical forces, they still felt that they lacked this and that, and it was difficult to work with ease.

    How can we work with ease? The masses were calculating in their hearts. They reviewed the road they had traveled from individual farming to mutual aid teams, from mutual aid teams to agricultural cooperatives, from small cooperatives to large cooperatives, and the strength that had been generated. They all realized that to overcome nature, we must twist everyone's strength into one rope, and people's thinking must be selfless. Every drought-fighting activity must be transformed into a collective activity in order to overcome all difficulties and thoroughly change the drought situation. Therefore, they sent people to the township Party committee again, saying, "Big things must rely on big cooperatives. It would be great if one township runs one cooperative, with sufficient strength!" Some people even named the big cooperative "Collective Farm." Therefore, the people of Shuiquan merged the six agricultural cooperatives again and established a collective farm, with unified allocation of labor and livestock, preparing to engage in large-scale production. A new form of production organization was thus born under the demands of the masses.

    Large-Scale and Public Ownership, Infinite Power

    Not long after the "Collective Farm" was built, Chairman Mao proposed that "the People's Commune is still good." When the masses heard the good news, they were overjoyed and told each other, "The People's Commune is even better than the big cooperative. Let's still run the People's Commune!"

    In order to welcome the establishment of the People's Commune, the people of Shuiquan not only overfulfilled the original plan for water conservancy construction, but also more than 600 young and middle-aged people in the cooperative took their luggage, camped in the alkali flats, and worked hard for six days and six nights, building a reservoir that could store 300,000 cubic meters of water, as a gift to the People's Commune. In mid-August 1958, the peasants of Shuiquan Township and Douchuan Township voluntarily united, drumming and gongs, and happily raised the first red flag of the People's Commune in the county.

    The establishment of the People's Commune created extremely favorable conditions for large-scale farmland water conservancy construction and completely overcoming drought. The People's Commune rationally arranged production and took effective measures to solve the problem of insufficient labor. After the establishment of the commune, on the one hand, it vigorously developed collective welfare undertakings, which increased the number of laborers in the whole commune by more than 1,700 and invested them in various productions. On the other hand, the teams carried out large-scale cooperation according to the principle of equal exchange. For example, in the autumn of 1958, 43% of the labor force in the whole commune participated in large-scale steelmaking and the construction of the Yintao (River) Shangshan water conservancy project, but due to the development of cooperation, the autumn harvest work in 1958 was still completed fifteen days earlier than in 1957. In 1959, the cooperation was even better. For example, the northeast of Shuiquan is high and cold, and the southwest is relatively warm. The commune divided the two brigades of Dayingshui and Shuiquan in the northeast into grain bases, and the two brigades of Douchuan and Huangwan in the southwest into cotton bases. Cotton is planted in April, picked in September, grain is planted in February, summer crops are harvested in July, and autumn crops are harvested in October. The commune organized teams to cooperate according to the different sowing and maturity periods of crops. During spring sowing and summer harvesting, the cotton-producing areas helped the Dayingshui and Shuiquan teams to rush to plant and harvest grain fields by exchanging labor; when picking cotton, the grain-producing areas helped the Douchuan and Huangwan teams to pick cotton. In this way, both sowing and harvesting were done quickly and well. The saved time was used to vigorously carry out farmland water conservancy and basic construction work.

    In order to save labor, the whole commune also divided the cultivated area according to geographical conditions and the principle of facilitating production. The twenty production teams exchanged and adjusted more than 5,000 mu of interspersed land, turning remote land into nearby land. In autumn and winter, the sheep flocks were driven to the places where fertilizer was most needed to circle and step on manure, saving the time and manpower and animal power for transporting manure. And vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution to improve labor efficiency. After the realization of vehicular transportation, the efficiency of laying sandy land was three times higher than in the past. After the cotton sowing drill was manufactured, the efficiency of cotton planting was more than five times higher than in the past.

    The People's Commune comprehensively planned water resources and developed water conservancy. In Huangwan Brigade, which is close to the Yellow River, the method of diverting river water was adopted, and a water lifting and irrigation project was built on Tiaocheliang to divert the Yellow River water in eight stages to the Hanpingchuan, which is 180 meters high, which will turn 16,000 mu of dry land into irrigated land. Now more than 2,700 mu of irrigated land have been built. In places with groundwater, measures such as digging springs, digging wells, and drilling string wells are taken to intercept and divert groundwater. In places where there is neither river water nor groundwater, nor can flood water be diverted, the development of sandy land is vigorously developed. Irrigated land, sandy land, and dam land are advancing simultaneously, building one mu is one mu, and building one point is one point, starting from small places and accumulating small amounts into large amounts. The masses said, "With water flowing into the ground, there is no panic in the heart." "Building one mu of dam is better than ten mu of depression." "Sandy land preserves moisture, and the grain is like being stored in a warehouse."

    With sufficient labor and comprehensive planning, the funds and technical forces were used in a concentrated manner, and the water conservancy work developed by leaps and bounds. In the past year, four reservoirs have been built, more than ten springs have been dug, thirteen large-scale flood diversion channels have been built, and nearly 20,000 mu of irrigated land, sandy land, and dam land have been built, making the area of irrigated land, sandy land, and dam land in the whole commune reach 65.6% of the total land area of the whole commune, and the area of dry land has been reduced to 34.4%, with an average of more than four mu of irrigated land, sandy land, and dam land per person, which the masses call "insurance land." In addition, the commune also transferred more than 300 of the best laborers to the Yintao construction site all year round to dig high-mountain canals. After this canal is completed, it can change the drought situation in 24 counties (cities) in central Gansu, and most of the wasteland in Shuiquan can also be turned into good land.

    In 1959, there was no rain for more than seven months. While the commune was vigorously grasping farmland water conservancy, it also grasped field management. In order to rush to plant, food crops were planted by seizing the opportunity to rush to plant in moisture; cotton was planted by infiltrating water in manure, carrying water for spot watering, scalding seeds to promote germination, and mixing dry and wet seeds for sowing, so that all cultivated land was planted on schedule. After the seedlings emerged, seedling inspection and replanting were carried out to ensure that the seedlings emerged completely. When the drought became increasingly serious, some people developed pessimistic and disappointed emotions. The commune Party committee promptly put forward the slogan of "Resisting the disaster to the end, human power will surely defeat the heavens, and a bumper harvest in a severe drought," and mobilized the masses to fight against the drought in every possible way. Cadres and the masses ate, lived, and worked together, which boosted the confidence of the masses in fighting drought. The weeding, topdressing, and pest control work in 1959 were generally more than twice as many as in the past. Due to the great development of animal husbandry (the number of sheep increased to 17,483, more than double that of 1957, and the number of large livestock reached 3,125), the amount of fertilizer applied per mu also increased significantly. In this way, grain was fought for from the sky in all aspects, so that grain and cotton achieved a bumper harvest. People said, "Four mu of insurance land per person makes the old man in the sky glare in vain!" "With water, sand, and dams, we are not afraid of drought; ‘blessings’ are fought for from the heavens!"

    Production Harvest, Ideological Harvest

    Shuiquan, a place that has long been threatened by drought, in the past, although many places lacked water or had no water, people who longed for a life of abundant water and food named all the villages after water, such as Shuiquan, Shaojiashui, Dayingshui, Sharuishui, Shuitou, Yuwanquan, Jinishui, Yaoshuizi, Jianshuier, Huishuier, Jingerchuan... and so on. But thousands of years have passed, and the wishes of the Shuiquan people for water have never been realized. After the people's commune, the aspirations of the people became a reality.

    The first harvest after the communization brought infinite happiness and joy to the whole commune. In 1959, they sold the state surplus grain, cotton, livestock products, and by-products with a total value of 987,000 yuan, which was one and a half times more than in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. The public accumulation of the commune has reached 410,000 yuan, providing better conditions for further expanding reproduction. The income of the commune members has increased, and their lives have also improved. Each person has an average of 950 jin of grain, which is more than double that before the communization, and the grain-deficient commune has become a grain-surplus commune. The net income of each peasant has also increased from 28.16 yuan in 1957 to 65.2 yuan.

    Now, the people of Shuiquan Commune, on the basis of victory, continue to move forward with full confidence.

    (Note 1) Dam land is the land where dams are built on the edges of the land and flood water is diverted to flood over, which can preserve moisture and resist drought.
    (Note 2) Sandy land is a layer of gravel three to five inches thick laid on the land. It has the advantages of preserving moisture, keeping warm, resisting drought, suppressing alkali, and softening the soil. Sandy land that can be irrigated with water is called water-sand land, and the gravel layer is relatively thin, about two or three inches. Sandy land that cannot be irrigated with water is called dry-sand land, and the gravel layer is relatively thick.

    大旱七个月　依然保丰收
    中共甘肃省委人民公社调查组
    甘肃是全国雨量最少的地方，定西专区又是甘肃最干旱的地方，水泉人民公社就在“大旱不断头、小旱年年有”的定西专区靖远县东部。解放前，这里平常年景亩产仅二、三十斤。农民过着“有雨半年粮，雨少就逃荒，大旱更遭殃”的生活。水，在这里像生命一样珍贵。
    1959年，是公社化后的第一个年头。水泉地区七个多月没有下雨，但是，水泉人民公社的庄稼普遍生长茁壮，粮食、棉花都获得空前大丰收。粮食每亩平均产量达到二百四十六斤，棉花亩产达六十斤；粮食比1957年单产提高188％，棉花提高42％。1959年的棉田面积比公社化前扩大了四倍多，粮食总产量仍达到一千一百二十一万斤，比1957年增加了两倍多，比大跃进的1958年还增长5．45％；棉花总产达到四十九万二千斤，比1957年增长约七倍。全社到处呈现出前所未有的繁荣景象。
    革思想的命　革自然的命
    土地改革以后，党组织接受了群众的要求，决心领导群众战胜干旱，使人们过丰衣足食、旱涝无忧的日子。1953年，党号召群众防旱抗旱，人民政府并发放大批贷款，兴修水利。但是，有些人说：“地主是可以斗倒的，老天爷能抗得住吗？”党组织认为，要使群众自觉地行动起来战胜干旱，必须深入细致地进行艰巨的思想工作。党派常公民同志到砂流水村去做试点工作，领导群众找水源，兴水利。这一年，砂流水村修了三百四十八亩水地，水地的麦子亩产达到三百来斤。砂流水村农民又经过1954和1955两年的继续努力，兴修了水地五百多亩、坝地（注一）五十多亩，在没有泉水也没有洪水的地方铺砂地（注二）二百三十亩，做到了全村每人平均有三亩抗旱地。这三年，水泉乡连年大旱，但砂流水村却由缺粮村变成了余粮村，户户吃穿不发愁。
    1957年冬天，水泉乡的党组织大张旗鼓地在全乡十四个农业社全面推广砂流水村的经验，社员们纷纷表示决心，要向砂流水村看齐，各社提出要大干一冬一春，每人修半亩水地，全乡铺砂地三千亩。党组织积极地领导了群众的抗旱斗争。水泉乡成立了农田水利基本建设指挥部，由书记挂帅，全党动员，提出“九变一运动”的行动口号，即：山沟变水库，山湾变涝池，荒滩变砂地，旱地变水地，秃山变林园，低产变高产，缺粮变余粮，贫困变富裕，落后变先进，从而掀起一个人人动手、个个献策、改变干旱面貌的轰轰烈烈的群众运动。
    新任务　新矛盾
    生产关系的变革和“宿命论”思想的动摇，使人们有勇气、有力量向自然宣战了。但是，水泉地区水源缺乏，每年雨水又少，且多集中在秋季。在八百多平方公里的土地上，只有一千七百四十七户，一万一千九百五十九人，每个劳动力平均种地十五亩，每头役畜平均耕地三十一亩，地广人稀，人力、畜力不足。要大兴农田水利基本建设，把干山旱川改造成山上有树、遍地流水、旱涝无忧、永保丰收的花果山、米粮川，在任务和力量之间确实有着尖锐的矛盾。当时的农业社虽然做了许多出色的工作，但毕竟组织规模小、活动范围有限，在大规模地兴修农田水利基本建设方面，碰到了许多难以克服的困难。
    怎么办呢？有些农业社就派人到乡党委提出解决矛盾的具体办法，他们说：“不并大社，谁也干不好！”乡党委经过研究，根据群众的要求，就把全乡十四个农业社合成了六个。农业社扩大了，有些问题比较好解决了，如大营水、万家庙、石碑子、黄毛沟四个农业社并成一个社后，在1958年春天就修成了一个可灌地三千亩的水库，当第一次洪水下来时，水库拦截洪水浇灌了八百多亩地，群众情绪很高。但是，各农业社又要继续兴修水利，又要搞田间管理，在劳动力、工具、资金、技术力量等各方面，还是感到缺这少那，难以得心应手地大干。
    究竟如何才能得心应手呢？群众心里在盘算着。他们回顾了由单干到互助组、由互助组到农业社、由小社到大社所走过的道路，所产生的力量，都体会到：想战胜大自然，必须把大家的力量拧成一股绳，而人们的思想也必须要大公无私，要把每一项抗旱活动变成集体的活动，才能战胜千难万难，彻底改变干旱面貌。因此，他们又派人去找乡党委，说：“办大事要靠大社，一乡办一个社，力量足，多美气！”有人还给大社起名“集体农庄”。于是，水泉人民把六个农业社又合并起来，办成了集体农庄，劳动力、牲畜统一调配，准备大搞生产。一个新的生产组织形式，就这样在群众要求下诞生了。
    一大二公　威力无穷
    “集体农庄”建起不久，毛主席提出“还是人民公社好”。群众听到这个喜讯，欢天喜地，奔走相告，“人民公社比大社更好，咱们还是办人民公社吧！”
    为了迎接人民公社的建立，水泉人民不仅超额完成了原订修水利的计划，社里六百多个青壮年，又带了行李，扎营碱滩，大干了六天六夜，修成了一座可以蓄水三十万方的水库，作为向人民公社的献礼。1958年8月中旬，水泉乡和陡城乡农民自动联合起来，敲锣打鼓，兴高采烈地在全县举起了第一面人民公社的红旗。
    人民公社的成立，给大规模地兴修农田水利，彻底战胜干旱，创造了极其有利的条件。人民公社合理地安排了生产，并采取有效措施，解决了劳动力不足的问题。公社成立后，一方面大办集体福利事业，使全社增加了一千七百多个劳动力，投入了各项生产。另一方面，各队按照等价交换的原则展开大协作。如1958年秋季，全社有43％的劳动力，参加大炼钢铁和修建引洮（河）上山水利工程，但由于开展了协作，1958年的收秋工作仍比1957年提前十五天完成。1959年，协作搞得更好。如水泉东北高寒，西南较暖，公社把东北部的大营水和水泉两个大队划为粮食基地，把西南部的陡城和黄湾两个大队划为棉花基地。种棉花在4月，摘棉花在9月，种粮食在2月，收夏田在7月，收秋田在10月。公社根据农作物播种和成熟期的先后不同，组织各队协作。春播和夏收时，以互相换工的办法，产棉区帮助大营水和水泉队抢种抢收粮田；摘棉花的时候，产粮区帮助陡城和黄湾队采摘棉花。这样，播种和收获都搞得快、搞得好。节余的时间就大搞农田水利和基本建设工作。
    为了节约劳动力，全社还依据地理条件和便利生产的原则，划分了耕作区，二十个生产队互相兑换、调整了插花地五千多亩，变远地为近地。秋冬把羊群赶到最需肥的地方扎圈踩粪，节约了搬运粪肥的时间和人力、畜力。并且大闹技术革新和技术革命，提高劳动效率。实现运输车辆化后，铺砂地的效率比过去提高了三倍。制造出棉花播种耧后，种棉花工效比过去提高五倍多。
    人民公社全面地规划水力资源，发展水利。在靠近黄河的黄湾大队，采取把河水引上来的办法，在挑车梁兴修提水灌溉工程，把黄河水分八级引上一百八十米高的旱坪川，将使一万六千亩旱地变成水地，现在已修出水地二千七百多亩。在有地下水的地方，采取掏泉、挖井、打串井等办法，把地下水截引出来。在既无河水、又无地下水、也不能引洪漫地的地方，大力发展铺砂地。水地、砂地、坝地，齐头并进，修一亩是一亩，修一分是一分，小处着手，积少成多。群众说：“有水往地里淌，心里不发慌。”“打了一亩坝，胜过十亩洼。”“砂地保了墒，粮食像在仓里装。”
    有了足够的劳动力，有了全面规划，集中使用了资金和技术力量，水利工作就突飞猛进地发展起来了。一年来兴修了水库四座，掏泉十多眼，修大型引洪渠道十三条，修水地、铺砂地、筑坝地近两万亩，使全社水地、砂地、坝地的面积达到全社总土地面积的65．6％，使旱地面积缩减到34．4％，每人平均有水地、砂地、坝地四亩多，群众叫做“保险田”。此外，公社还抽调最好的劳动力三百多人，常年到引洮工地开凿高山运河。这一运河修通后，可改变甘肃中部二十四个县（市）的干旱面貌，水泉的大部荒地，也可变成良田。
    1959年七个多月没有下雨，公社在大抓农田水利的同时，也抓紧田间管理工作。为了抢种，对粮食作物采取了抓紧时机抢墒下种的办法；对棉花用粪中渗水，担水点浇，烫种催芽，干湿种子混合播种等办法，使全部耕地按期种完。出苗后又进行查苗补苗，使苗出齐。当旱象日益严重的时候，有些人产生了悲观失望情绪，公社党委及时提出“抗灾抗到底，人力定胜天，大旱大丰收”的口号，动员群众千方百计与干旱作斗争。干部和群众同吃、同住、同劳动，鼓舞了群众抗旱的信心。1959年的锄草、追肥、灭虫等工作，普遍比过去多两次。由于牧业的大发展（羊增加到一万七千四百八十三只，比1957年多一倍，大家畜达到三千一百二十五头）每亩地施肥量也显著增加。这样从各个方面与天争粮，使粮食和棉花获得了大丰收。人们说：“每人四亩保险田，气得老天干瞪眼！”“有了水砂坝，天旱也不怕；‘福’是从老天手里争来的！”
    生产丰收　思想丰收
    水泉，这块长期遭受干旱威胁的地方，过去，尽管很多地方缺水或无水，但盼望着过水足粮丰的日子的人们把村庄全部以水命名，如水泉、邵家水、大营水、砂流水、水头、玉碗泉、汲泥水、腰水子、碱水儿、灰水儿、井儿川……等等。但是几千年过去了，水泉群众对于水的愿望始终没有实现。人民公社化后，人们向往的才变成了生活的真实。
    公社化后的第一个丰收，给全社带来了无限幸福和喜悦，他们在1959年售给国家的余粮、棉花、畜产品、副产品总值达九十八万七千元，比大跃进的1958年还多一倍半。公社公共积累已达四十一万元，给进一步扩大再生产提供了更好的条件。社员的收入增加了，生活也改善了，每人平均有粮九百五十斤，比公社化前提高了两倍多，缺粮社变成了余粮社。每个农民的纯收入，也从1957年的二十八点一六元增加到六十五点二元。
    现在，水泉公社的人民，在胜利的基础上，继续满怀信心地大步前进着。
    （注一）坝地就是在地边筑坝，引洪水漫过的田地，能够保墒耐旱。
    （注二）砂地就是在土地上铺三至五寸厚的沙砾层。有保墒、保温、抗旱、压碱、松软等好处。引水可浇灌的砂地，叫水砂地，沙砾层较薄，约二、三寸。不能引水浇灌的砂地叫旱砂地，沙砾层较厚。
