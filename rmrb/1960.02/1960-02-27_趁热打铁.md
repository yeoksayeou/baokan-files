    Strike While the Iron is Hot

    Historically, there is the story of Zhuge Liang taking advantage of the favorable east wind to defeat Cao Cao. In our ironworker trade, there is also a saying: "Strike while the iron is hot." This shows how precious time is, and how precious a "good opportunity" is. The current situation is that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. Our country has achieved continuous great leaps forward in 1958 and 1959. In the first month of entering 1960, we achieved another good start. It is truly a bright spring, a great opportunity, waiting for us to "strike while the iron is hot," continue to exert our energy, and make production continue to leap forward.

    To "strike while the iron is hot," we must have amazing speed. If the iron is very hot, and you only strike it once in a long time, the iron will cool down. What are you hitting then? So, you have to strike quickly, let the speed of the hammer blows become faster and faster, so that the parts that originally required two blows can be made in one.

    Another thing is to have drive. Only with great drive can you strike quickly. Only with soaring enthusiasm can you take advantage of the heat and make the iron.

    You can't take advantage of the heat if you strike iron foolishly. Zhuge Liang of the Three Kingdoms used his brain beforehand and found the "good opportunity of the east wind" before defeating Cao Cao without deploying a single soldier. It is the same with striking iron. Some veterans have found the trick and finished the battle in three blows, taking advantage of the heat. Some who have not found the way have exerted the strength of ten blows, but it is still "half-cooked," and they have to add fire to burn it red again. Some turn on electric hammers, pneumatic hammers, and steam hammers, skillfully use dies, and "quickly finish the job," taking advantage of the heat to make the parts. Others hug the big hammer and strike with sweat all over their faces, exhausting themselves, but in the end, they still "don't take advantage of the heat" and have to re-burn the "half-cooked rice." This illustrates the importance of finding tricks and boldly innovating technology.

    The above is an example using iron striking. In fact, it is the same in our daily work: everyone must race against time, everyone must have soaring enthusiasm, and everything must be innovative and creative. In this way, we will do our work more, faster, better, and more economically. "Opportunity knocks but once," let us take advantage of the good times, exert our energy, strive for daily red, and full-house red, and successfully complete this year's tasks.

### 趁热打铁

    趁热打铁
    历史上有个孔明趁东风良机战胜曹操的故事。在我们铁工中也有一句俗语：“趁热打铁”。可见时间之可贵，“良机”之可贵。现在的形势是东风压倒西风，我国在1958年和1959年取得了连续大跃进。在迈进1960年的头一个月里，又取得了开门红。真是春光明媚，大好良机，只等我们“趁热”继续鼓足干劲，使生产继续飞跃。
    要“趁热打铁”，就要有惊人的速度。如果铁烧得很热，你半天才打一锤，铁都凉了，你还打个什么？所以要快打，让落锤的速度越来越快，使原来两次才能打成的配件，一次就可以打成。
    再一个是要有干劲，劲大才能打得快。只有干劲冲天，才能趁上热，打成铁。
    打铁傻打也趁不上热。三国的孔明事先用了脑子，找到了“东风良机”，才一兵不出，战胜了曹操。打铁也是如此。有的老手找到了窍门，三锤就结束了战斗，趁上了热；有些没找到大门的，十锤的力气已出，却还是“夹生饭”，不得不再加火烧红。有的开动电锤、风锤、汽锤，熟练地利用胎具，“三下五去二”就趁上了热，打成了配件；而有的老抱住大锤，满头大汗地打，弄得筋疲力尽，到头来还是没“趁上热”，还得再烧“夹生饭”。这说明了找窍门、大胆革新技术的重要性。
    以上是以打铁作个例子。其实，在我们的日常工作中，也是如此：人人要争分夺秒，个个要干劲冲天，事事要革新创造。这样，我们就会把工作做的又多、又快、又好、又省。“机不可失，时不再来”，让我们趁着大好时光，鼓足干劲，争取日日红、满堂红，出色地完成今年的任务。	  北京铁路管理局石家庄车辆段　安连琦
