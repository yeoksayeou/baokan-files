Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, who overfulfilled the production plans for steel, pig iron, and steel materials in the first fifty-seven days of this year, held a conference of advanced producers today and issued a "Greatly Increase Enthusiasm and Go All Out to Complete the National Steel Production Plan for the First Quarter Ahead of Schedule" proposal to workers of national iron and steel enterprises. Their goal is to guarantee the completion of the national plans for steel, pig iron, and steel materials twenty-four, five, and two days ahead of schedule respectively, seize a comprehensive leap forward in the first spring of the sixties, and at the same time, fully prepare for production in the second quarter.

The proposal stated that under the illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, all the workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, together with fraternal enterprises across the country, actively responded to the great call of the Party Central Committee to ensure a good start in production this year, and victoriously unveiled the prelude to the great leap forward in 1960. As of February 26, the output of steel, pig iron, and steel materials had already completed 85.7%, 64.7%, and 64% of the quarter's tasks, respectively. In the face of this excellent situation, in order to advance victoriously, realize a comprehensive leap forward in the first spring of the sixties, and lay a reliable foundation for the sustained leap forward throughout the year, we are determined to learn from the advanced experience of the National Conference of Heroes and fraternal enterprises, catch up and go all out, guarantee the completion of the first quarter production plan twenty-four days ahead of schedule for steel, five days ahead of schedule for pig iron, and two days ahead of schedule for steel materials, realize a comprehensive great leap forward in high yield, high quality, multiple varieties, low cost, and safe production, and at the same time, fully prepare for production in the second quarter. We hereby propose to fraternal enterprises across the country to launch a friendly competition to complete the national plan for the first quarter ahead of schedule.

The measures proposed in the proposal are: First, conscientiously study and promote the advanced experiences of the National Conference of Heroes and fraternal enterprises, implement fourteen major advanced experiences such as increasing smelting intensity, reducing coke ratio, using high hot blast, and top-blown converter hot blast in blast furnaces; second, save raw materials, improve raw material conditions, rely on our own efforts, vigorously increase the production of sintered ore, reduce coke consumption, save raw coal, and reduce pig iron consumption in converters. Implement coke grading into the furnace, sintering ore screening, and ore washing; improve raw material conditions; third, use the method of walking on two legs to build high trestles and low cargo positions, and manufacture indigenous transportation equipment such as hand-held shovels, belt conveyors, and coal unloaders, striving to realize the mechanization of loading and unloading and the automatic transportation line of pig iron, coke, steel ingots, and raw coal, and improve transportation capacity; fourth, strengthen equipment maintenance, improve equipment capacity, improve maintenance quality, shorten maintenance time, and further improve the operating rate of blast furnaces, converters, and rolling mills; fifth, leading cadres at all levels should go to the front line of production, strengthen production command, grasp measures, grasp inspections, promptly solve problems in production, and seize the production preparations for the next step, to ensure the continuous leap forward of production.

On the basis of the tremendous achievements made in 1959, the workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company launched a mass movement centered on vigorous technological innovation and technological revolution from the beginning of this year without leaving their posts, constantly solving new problems in this year's leap forward. The ironmaking workers learned from the experience of Benxi Iron and Steel Company in improving smelting intensity, carried out technical debates, broke the shackles of old technical operation methods, and implemented measures such as expanding the diameter of tuyeres, increasing the speed of blowers, and eliminating air leakage in pipelines, which improved the smelting intensity of blast furnaces and increased the average daily output of pig iron in January by 4.3% compared with December of last year. Steel workers, focusing on the key problem of insufficient iron melting capacity of iron melting furnaces, adopted measures such as carbon tamping furnace lining, water-cooled tuyeres, and blower series connection, which increased the furnace opening rate of iron melting furnaces by 15% and the hourly iron melting capacity by 30%, ensuring a substantial increase in converter steel production. In more than a month, the steel rolling workers trial-produced and produced thirteen new varieties of steel materials, and designed, manufactured, and installed positive and negative surrounding disks, realizing multiple quick rolling, which not only greatly reduced the labor intensity of the workers, but also increased the production capacity by 20%.

In order to adapt to the needs of continued leap forward this year and better organize production, the company conscientiously strengthened the leadership of production, and mobilized the masses to participate in management, achieving both high yield and balance. The converter steelmaking workers promoted the method of formulating hourly operation plans for the next shift during their shifts, eliminating the phenomenon that production between the three shifts was sometimes not well connected.

In order to ensure the realization of the advocacy conditions they put forward to the national iron and steel enterprises, the employees of this company have now put forward new struggle goals. In March, they will launch a larger-scale technological innovation and technological revolution movement aimed at strengthening key equipment, improving raw material utilization, and transforming manual operations into mechanized and semi-mechanized production, striving to increase the level of steel and iron production in March by an estimated 5% and 15% respectively compared to February.

    石景山钢铁公司向全国钢铁战线职工发出倡议
    开展提前完成首季计划大竞赛
    石钢全体职工决心大鼓干劲，大干特干，分别提前二十四天、五天和两天完成
    第一季度钢、生铁和钢材的国家计划，同时充分做好第二季度的生产准备工作
    新华社26日讯　在今年头五十七天中超额完成钢、生铁和钢材生产计划的石景山钢铁公司职工，今天举行先进生产者大会，向全国钢铁企业职工发出了“大鼓干劲，大干一场，提前超额完成第一季度国家钢铁生产计划”的倡议。他们的目标是：保证分别提前二十四天、五天和两天完成第一季度钢、生铁、钢材国家计划，夺取六十年代第一个春天的全面跃进，同时充分作好第二季度的生产准备工作。
    倡议书说，在党的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，石景山钢铁公司全体职工和全国兄弟企业一道，积极响应了党中央提出的确保今年生产开门红的伟大号召，胜利地揭开了1960年大跃进的序幕。到2月26日为止，钢、生铁和钢材的产量，已经分别完成了全季任务的85．7％、64．7％和64％。在这种大好形势的面前，为了乘胜前进，实现六十年代第一个春天的全面跃进，为全年的持续跃进打下可靠的基础，我们决心学习全国的先进经验，急起直追大干一场，保证钢提前二十四天、生铁提前五天、钢材提前两天完成第一季度生产计划，实现高产优质、多品种、低成本和安全生产的全面大跃进，同时充分作好第二季度的生产准备工作。并以此向全国兄弟企业倡议开展一个提前完成第一季度国家计划的友谊竞赛。
    倡议书提出的措施是：第一，认真学习和推广全国群英会和兄弟企业的先进经验，推行高炉提高冶炼强度、降低焦比、使用高风温和转炉热风吹炼等十四项重大先进经验；第二，节约原材料，改善原料条件，自力更生，大力增产烧结矿，降低焦炭消耗，节约原煤，降低转炉生铁消耗。实行焦炭的分级入炉、烧结矿的筛分和矿石洗选；改善原料状况；第三，用两条腿走路的办法，大搞高栈台、低货位和制造手扶铲、皮带机、卸煤机等洋、土运输设备，力争实现生铁、焦炭、钢锭、原煤等装卸的机械化和运输自动线，提高运输能力；第四，加强设备维护，提高设备能力，提高检修质量，缩短检修时间，进一步提高高炉、转炉和轧机的作业率；第五，各级领导干部亲临生产第一线，加强生产指挥，抓措施、抓检查，及时解决生产中的问题，并抓紧下一步的生产准备工作，保证生产的节节跃进。
    石景山钢铁公司职工在取得1959年巨大成绩的基础上，今年一开始就人不离鞍马不停蹄，掀起了以大闹技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众运动，不断解决今年跃进中的新问题。炼铁工人学习本溪钢铁公司提高冶炼强度的经验，开展了技术大辩论，打破了旧的技术操作方法的束缚，实现了扩大风口直径、加大风机转速、消除管道跑风等措施，提高了高炉的冶炼强度，使1月份生铁平均日产水平比去年12月份提高了4．3％。钢铁工人针对化铁炉熔化铁水能力不足的关键，采取了炭捣炉衬、水冷风眼和风机串联等措施，使化铁炉的开炉率提高了15％，每小时熔化铁水的能力提高了30％，保证了转炉钢产量的大幅度增长。轧钢工人在一个多月中就试制和生产了十三个新品种的钢材，并且自行设计、制造和安装了正反围盘，实现了多条快轧，不仅大大减轻了工人的劳动强度，并且使生产能力提高了20％。
    为了适应今年继续跃进的需要，更好地组织生产，这个公司认真加强了对生产的领导，并且发动群众参加管理，作到了既高产又均衡。转炉炼钢工人推行了上班给下班制定小时作业计划的方法，消除了三班之间生产有时不够衔接的现象。
    这个公司的职工为了保证实现他们向全国钢铁企业提出的倡议条件，现在又提出了新的奋斗目标。在3月份内，要针对加强关键设备、改善原料利用、变手工操作为机械化半机械化生产等内容开展一个规模更大的技术革新和技术革命运动，争取3月份钢、铁生产的水平比2月份预计再分别提高5％和15％以上。（附图片）
