Transport Whatever Agriculture Needs
Zhangzhou Freight Station Establishes Liaison Stations with Communes to Enthusiastically Support Spring Ploughing

(Our report) The Zhangzhou Freight Station in Fujian resolutely implements the policy of "facing the countryside and serving agricultural production." It has established liaison stations in rural areas, transporting whatever the rural areas need, and doing everything possible to support agriculture, which has been warmly praised by farmers.

Before the arrival of this year's spring ploughing season, the Zhangzhou Freight Station put forward the slogan "Seeds and fertilizers shall not stay overnight." It tried every means to organize transportation forces to rush the transportation of spring ploughing production materials. Recently, a large quantity of sugarcane from the Buwen and Tianbao Communes in Longxi could not be transported. The production of the Zhangzhou Sugar Factory and spring ploughing production were both affected. Employees Ni Changgeng and Xu Wenji took the initiative to contact all parties and organized the return trips of construction departments transporting building materials to rush the transportation of sugarcane. In one month, they transported more than 3,600 tons, which satisfied the factory, the commune, and the construction department. On the 12th of this month, at midnight, 350 tons of seeds had to be transferred from Jinjiang and other places to western Fujian. Employees Yao Chengyi and others went to the pesticide factory 13 kilometers away early in the morning to organize 150 tons of calcium carbonate and 140 tons of pesticides, using the vehicles going to Jinjiang to transport seeds to transport this batch of pesticides and fertilizers to the countryside.

Up to the beginning of February this year, the Zhangzhou Freight Station has transported more than 5,700 tons of materials such as seeds, fertilizers, agricultural tools, and sugarcane for the countryside, providing timely support for spring ploughing production.

    农业需要什么就赶运什么
    漳州货运站和公社建立联络站热情支援春耕
    本报讯  福建漳州货运站坚决贯彻“面向农村，为农业生产服务”的方针，在农村建立联络站，农村需要什么，就赶运什么，千方百计支援农业，受到农民热烈的赞扬。
    今年春耕到来之前，漳州货运站就提出了“种子肥料不过夜”的口号，千方百计组织运输力量，及时抢运春耕生产资料，最近龙溪步文、天宝公社有大批甘蔗运不出来。漳州糖厂的生产和春耕生产都受到影响。货运站职工倪长庚、许文机便主动与各方面联系，组织建筑部门运输建筑材料的回空车抢运甘蔗，一个月中运了三千六百多吨，工厂、公社和建筑部门都满意。本月12日半夜，有三百五十吨种子要由晋江等地转运闽西。职工姚承义等人天一亮就到十三公里外的农药厂等地，去组织了一百五十吨碳酸钙、一百四十吨农药，利用去晋江运种子的车辆，把这批农药、肥料运下乡。
    今年到2月上旬止，漳州货运站共为农村运送了种子、肥料、农具、甘蔗等物资五千七百多吨，及时支援了春耕生产。
