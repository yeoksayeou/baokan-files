Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. People's commune system has brought minority areas into a new stage of rapid development of production and construction, and laid a solid foundation for the prosperity and development of all ethnic groups.

    With the exception of a small number of areas such as Tibet, people's communes have been basically realized in minority areas throughout the country. During the period of advanced cooperatives, although production in minority areas had greatly developed, the minority people were limited by conditions such as manpower, materials, funds, and production experience, and had no strength to comprehensively develop diverse economies, and the abundant resources of the ethnic regions could not be fully utilized. The people's commune perfectly combines the fundamental interests of all ethnic groups into a unified whole, and the wisdom and talents of all ethnic groups are fully utilized. Many ethnic groups that previously operated solely in animal husbandry or hunting have begun to learn diversified operations; ethnic groups that have long used primitive methods for agricultural and animal husbandry production have quickly mastered advanced production technologies; and commune-run industries have blossomed everywhere.

    In the past year, agricultural production in minority areas has leaped to a new level. Relying on the superior conditions of the people's communes, all ethnic groups have resolutely implemented the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," further changed the original backward farming system, and universally promoted new-style farm tools. The grain production of some minority areas has caught up with or is approaching the level of Han areas. In the sparsely populated Altay region of Xinjiang, the sown area was expanded last year, and grain output increased by more than 67% compared with the previous year, and oil crops also increased by 2.8 times. Last year, eight minority-inhabited counties in Guangxi, including Sanjiang, Damiaoshan, and Longsheng, caught up with the advanced level of grain production in the Han areas of Guangxi. Jianhe, Liping, Huangping, Dushan, Zhenning, which are inhabited by minority ethnic groups in Guizhou, and Hezhang, which is inhabited by multiple ethnic groups, all became "thousand-catty rice counties" last year. In the Li and Miao areas of Hainan Island, the rice output of most people's communes increased by 30% to 40% compared with the previous year. Many "slash-and-burn" farming methods that existed in the deep mountains not long ago have also seen many "thousand-catty mu". After many pastoral areas established people's communes, they all extracted a portion of the labor force to form specialized agricultural production teams to develop agricultural production, and the situation in which the pastoral areas relied on supplies of food, feed, and fuel from other places is changing. Ten counties in Qinghai's pastoral areas have achieved self-sufficiency in grain.

    Animal husbandry production in minority areas has also greatly developed. People's communes have great strength and are able to undertake basic pastoral construction that could not be done in the past, and have the conditions to implement various measures to increase pastoral production. According to incomplete statistics in Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas, a total of 5,800 new wells were drilled last year, and a number of reservoirs, hydropower stations, mechanical water supply stations, and canals were built, expanding the irrigated area of grassland by more than 660,000 mu; more than 200,000 new sheds were built, enough to accommodate more than 10 million head of livestock, and the grain and feed base was expanded to more than 3.7 million mu. After the people's communes in Qinghai's pastoral areas were established, the management of animal husbandry was greatly strengthened. At the end of last year, the first-class fatness of livestock reached about 95%, an increase of 25% compared with the same period last year, and many high-yield sheep flocks have emerged. In the past, minority pastoral areas rarely raised pigs. After communization, more and more places are raising pigs, except for a few ethnic groups that prohibit pigs. The number of pigs bred in Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Gansu last year increased by 1.5 times compared with the previous year, averaging 1.6 heads per household. The Xilingol and Hulunbuir grasslands in Inner Mongolia, which have never raised pigs and poultry, also saw a thriving scene of chickens and ducks in groups and pigs in pens last year.

    People's communes in minority areas have universally established various factories that serve agricultural and animal husbandry production and collective life welfare. The ranks of minority workers have grown rapidly. Tools that could not be manufactured locally in the past can now be manufactured, and the rich resources of the ethnic regions are beginning to be developed and utilized. The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has initially formed a network for the manufacture, repair, and distribution of agricultural implements. Since communization, it has manufactured and repaired a total of 420,000 agricultural implements. More than 100,000 people in Inner Mongolia have initially mastered various production technologies in commune-run industries. Before the communization of Longsheng Autonomous County of Various Nationalities in Guangxi, there was only one oil press, a small winery, and a small hydropower station in the entire county. Now, farm tool factories and comprehensive processing factories have been universally established in each commune. In the pastoral and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas of Xinjiang, the hundreds of milk powder factories and butter factories newly built in the past year have produced 400 tons of milk powder and more than 400 tons of cream and butter.

    Most people's communes in minority areas are jointly composed of members of two or more ethnic groups. With the big family of the people's commune, it is easier for all ethnic groups to help backward ethnic groups catch up with advanced ethnic groups, and achieve complete equality and common prosperity in the economy and culture of all ethnic groups. In the past year, the people's communes in ethnic-inhabited areas and multi-ethnic areas have extensively carried out large-scale revolutionary competitions to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, surpass the advanced, and help the backward, closely cooperating and supporting each other. For example, Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County in Guangxi twisted the strength of all communes in the county into one rope, and linked up with 32 counties inside and outside the autonomous region to launch a revolutionary competition. In the competition, the communes learned the reasonable irrigation and drainage methods of Chaoan County, Guangdong, and all the late rice last year did not lodge, and a large area of bumper harvests was obtained. The soil salinization in the Ningxia Yellow River irrigation area is serious. The Hui and Han people rely on the people's commune, uniformly plan and arrange the labor force, and together built thousands of drainage ditches, improving the soil area of more than 1.1 million mu. Because members of all ethnic groups work and live together, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, and carry forward the fine traditions of the people of all ethnic groups, they have broken down the old conventions and bad habits that have been unfavorable to production for thousands of years. In the past, most of the Miao people in Guizhou were accustomed to transplanting late rice, "transplanting seedlings until the end of June, and harvesting until the middle of October" (referring to the lunar calendar), which affected crop growth. Last year, the Miao commune members completely changed this old habit in production, and completed the transplanting more than half a month earlier, and the harvest period was also advanced accordingly. Many other ethnic groups have broken superstitions, and still go to work on the original production "taboo days."

    人民公社为各族人民发展生产奠定巩固基础
    少数民族地区高歌猛进
    新华社3日讯　人民公社制度使少数民族地区的生产建设，进入了飞跃发展的新阶段，为各少数民族的繁荣和发展，奠定了巩固的基础。
    全国少数民族地区，除西藏等一小部分地区外，已经基本上实现了人民公社化。在高级合作社时期，虽然少数民族地区的生产有了很大发展，但少数民族由于受到人力、物力、资金和生产经验等条件的限制，没有力量全面发展多种经济，民族地区的丰富资源得不到充分利用。人民公社把各民族人民的根本利益，完善地结合成为统一的整体，各民族的智慧和特长，都得到充分发挥。许多过去单一地经营畜牧业或猎业的民族，开始学会多种经营；长期用原始方法进行农牧业生产的民族，很快掌握了先进生产技术；社办工业已经遍地开花。
    过去一年中，少数民族地区的农业生产，跃进到新的水平，各民族依靠人民公社的优越条件，坚决贯彻农业八字宪法，进一步改变了原来落后的耕作制度，普遍推广了新式农具。有些少数民族地区的粮食生产，已经赶上或者接近汉族地区的水平。在新疆人烟稀少的阿勒泰专区，去年扩大了播种面积，粮食产量比前一年增加67％以上，油料作物也增长二点八倍。广西去年有三江、大苗山、龙胜等八个少数民族聚居县，粮食生产赶上了广西汉族地区的先进水平。贵州少数民族聚居的剑河、黎平、黄平、独山、镇宁和多民族杂居的赫章，都在去年一跃成为水稻千斤县，海南岛的黎族苗族地区，去年绝大多数人民公社的稻谷产量都比前年增长三、四成，不久前还存在“刀耕火种”耕作方式的深山，也出现了许多千斤亩。很多牧区建立人民公社后，都抽出一部分劳动力，组成农业生产专业队，发展农业生产，过去牧区人粮畜料靠外地供应的情况正在改变。青海已有十个牧区的县，粮食做到自给。
    少数民族地区的畜牧业生产，也有了很大发展。人民公社力量大，能够兴办过去办不到的牧业基本建设，有条件贯彻各种牧业增产措施。据内蒙古牧区不完全统计，去年共打新井五千八百多眼，兴建了一批水库、水电站、机械供水站和渠道，扩大草原灌溉面积六十六万多亩；新建的棚圈有二十多万座，足够容纳一千多万头牲畜，粮食饲料基地扩大到三百七十万多亩。青海牧区人民公社化后，饲养管理工作大大加强，去年年底牲畜的一类膘达到95％左右，比前年同期的一类膘增加25％，并出现了许多高额丰产羊群。以前少数民族牧区很少养猪，公社化后，除了少数禁猪的民族以外，养猪的地方越来越多，甘肃甘南藏族自治州去年下半年繁殖起来的猪数，比前年激增一倍半，平均每户一点六头。从来没有饲养过猪和家禽的内蒙古锡林郭勒、呼伦贝尔草原，去年也出现了鸡鸭成群猪满圈的繁荣景象。
    少数民族地区人民公社普遍建立起为农牧业生产和集体生活福利服务的各种工厂，少数民族工人队伍迅速壮大了，原来当地不能制造的工具现在能够制造了，民族地区的丰富资源，开始被人们开发利用。宁夏回族自治区已经初步组成农具制造修配网，公社化以来，共制造和修配了四十二万件农具。内蒙古已有十万多人初步掌握了社办工业中的各种生产技术。广西龙胜各族自治县在公社化以前，全县只有一个榨油厂、小酒厂和小型水电站，现在各公社普遍建立了农具厂和综合加工厂等。在新疆的牧区和半农半牧区，一年来新建的几百座奶粉厂和酥油厂，就生产了四百吨奶粉和四百多吨奶油、酥油。
    少数民族地区的大多数人民公社，都是由两种民族以上的成员联合组成的。各民族有了人民公社大家庭，更便于帮助落后民族赶上先进民族，达到各民族经济文化上的完全平等和共同繁荣。过去一年中，民族聚居地区和民族杂居地区的人民公社，广泛开展了大规模的学先进、赶先进、超先进和帮后进的革命竞赛，亲密协作，相互支援。例如广西的三江侗族自治县，把全县各公社的力量扭成一股绳，和自治区内外的三十二个县挂钩，展开革命竞赛，各公社在竞赛中学习广东潮安县的合理排灌方法，去年的晚稻全部没有倒伏，得到大面积丰收。宁夏黄河灌区土壤盐碱化严重，回汉人民就依靠人民公社，统一规划、统一安排劳动力，一起兴修了上千条排水沟渠，改良土壤面积达一百一十多万亩。由于各民族成员在一起共同劳动和生活，取长补短，发扬了各民族人民的优良传统，破除了千百年来不利于生产的陈规陋俗。贵州的苗族过去大都是习惯插晚秧，每年“栽秧栽到六月末，打谷打到十月半”（指农历），使作物生长受到影响，去年，苗族社员们彻底改变了这种生产上的旧习惯，提前半个多月插完秧，收获期也相应提前了。还有许多少数民族打破迷信，原来的生产“忌日”也照样出工。
