The American Imperialists Actually Want to Steal My Artistic Treasures
Poem by Yuan Shuipai, Cartoon by Hua Junwu

A gentleman with an impressive appearance,
His eyes light up at the sight of money, his hands are itching.
The sovereignty of the eastern family's country,
The cultural relics and treasures of the western family.
The "ambassador" comes forward,
The president makes an appearance.
Picking pockets now has a new look,
A contract for both parties.
"Exhibition," "Exhibition,"
Easy to part, hard to meet!
Boxes heavy,
Ships full.
One is thick-skinned,
The other is greedy!
Picking pockets in public,
An international grand larceny case! (Attached picture)

    美帝竟要劫走我艺术珍品
    袁水拍诗　华君武画
    绅士一表堂堂，
    见财眼开手痒，
    东家的江山主权，
    西家的文物宝藏。
    “大使”出面，
    总统亮相。
    扒掱如今翻新样，
    双方合同一张。
    “展览”，“展览”，
    别时容易见时难！
    一只只箱儿重，
    一条条船儿满。
    一个脸厚，
    一个心贪！
    当众摸口袋，
    国际大盗案！（附图片）
