    Zhongshan University History Department Compiles "The Complete Works of Lin Zexu"

    The editing of "The Complete Works of Lin Zexu," included in the "Chinese Modern History Data Series," has recently been completed. This complete collection is the responsibility of the Modern Chinese History Teaching and Research Group of the History Department of Zhongshan University.

    The content of the complete works is relatively rich, including many newly discovered important materials. For example, Lin Zexu's diary is much more complete than previously circulated versions. These diaries were obtained from the descendants of the Lin family in Fujian and record Lin Zexu's activities in Jiangsu, Huguang, Xinjiang, and other places over twelve years. From his diaries in Xinjiang, we can find important information about his opening of the Eight Cities of Southern Xinjiang and constructing farmland irrigation projects during his exile in Yili. In addition, the newly obtained letters are also very important. Among them, more than one hundred letters between him and Yiliang provide new materials on Lin Zexu's ban on opium and resistance to the British in Guangdong. Some of his letters with Yu Kun are also very valuable for understanding how he united Yu Kun and how Yu Kun cooperated with him in banning opium and resisting the British. From his correspondence with Pan Deyi and other letters, we can know that Lin Zexu was engaged in rectifying coastal defense, inspecting coastal ports, organizing anti-British activities, and dedicating himself to patriotic causes in his old home in Fujian from the time he was dismissed from office until the year before his death. This time, many original manuscripts of important value were also copied from the descendants of the Lin family. From Lin Zexu's handwritten "Property Division Document," it can be seen that Lin Zexu's estate was limited and he was an honest official throughout his life. The complete works have made more detailed textual research and verification of the dates of memorials and letters, and have made appropriate arrangements for the order of the materials, totaling about one million words.

    中山大学历史系编成“林则徐全集”
    列入“中国近代史资料丛书”的“林则徐全集”的编辑工作已于最近完成，这部全集是由中山大学历史系中国近代现代史教研组负责编辑的。
    全集的内容比较丰富，其中包括不少新发现的重要资料，例如林则徐的日记即较过去流传的完整得多。这些日记是从福建林氏后裔那里获得的，记载了林则徐在江苏、湖广、新疆等地十二年间的活动。从他在新疆的日记中，我们可以找到他被遣戍伊犁期间在疆南开回疆八城、兴修农田水利等重要资料。此外，新得到的书札也很重要。其中他和怡良来往的一百多封信，提供了林则徐在广东禁烟和抗英时期的新材料。他和豫坤的一些信件，对了解他如何团结豫坤、豫坤如何与他合作禁烟、抗英的史实，也是很有价值的。从他和潘德舆的通信及其他信件中，可以知道林则徐被革职后直到他临终前一年，一直在福建老家从事整顿海防、巡视海口、组织抗英活动，致力爱国事业。这次还从林氏后裔那里抄来很多有重要价值的原稿，从林则徐亲笔的“折产书”中，可以看出林则徐遗产有限，生平为官清廉。全集对奏议、书札等日期作了比较详细的考证和审定，对材料次序作了适当的安排，全部约一百万字左右。
