Guaranteeing Spring Irrigation Water, Preparing for Spring Flood Control
Guangdong, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan and Other Provinces Exceed Planned Targets for Winter and Spring Water Conservancy Projects

Guangdong

By the eve of the Spring Festival, Guangdong Province had completed more than 210,000 water conservancy projects of all sizes, increasing and improving irrigation and drainage areas by 10,720,000 mu. The originally planned earth and stone work volume had been completed ahead of schedule, exceeding the plan by 57%.

This winter and spring water conservancy construction in Guangdong Province further implemented the policy of focusing on water storage, community management, small-scale projects, and combining large, medium, and small projects. The vast majority of the more than 210,000 small-scale projects built throughout the province have been completed. Among the large reservoirs with a water storage capacity of over 100 million cubic meters, Hege, Xiaojiang, Liangde, Dasha River, Tangxi, Dalongdong, Gongping, and Sanhe, among others, have all been completed or are basically completed. Among the 485 key projects benefiting over 10,000 mu, 298 have been completed or are basically completed, and the vast majority of the remainder are expected to be completed before the spring plowing or spring floods, meeting the needs for spring irrigation water and flood control.

Currently, more than 30,000 water conservancy projects of all sizes are still under construction throughout the province. The laborers on the water control front are determined to use even greater perseverance and faster speed to strive for a complete victory in the water conservancy movement.

Zhejiang

More than 182,000 small and medium-sized water conservancy projects in Zhejiang Province have been completed and started storing water before the Spring Festival. According to statistics up to January 21, the province's original winter water conservancy repair earth and stone work task has been overfulfilled, and the completed earth and stone work has more than doubled that of the same period last year.

In the water conservancy movement, the province has made full use of water resources, intercepting water for power generation at every level. Four hundred and six hydroelectric power stations have been built, with a total installed capacity of over 10,000 kilowatts; 586 hydraulic processing stations have been built, totaling more than 7,400 horsepower.

On the basis of the great achievements made in the previous stage, all parts of the province are currently continuing to exert great efforts, concentrating their main forces on the construction of large and medium-sized projects, achieving complete projects, and giving full play to the benefits of the projects.

Anhui

Before the Spring Festival, Anhui Province had completed 1,213 river channels (a total length of 4,660 kilometers), built 1,674 reservoirs, and completed more than 173,000 projects such as ponds, dams, ditches, and culverts, having overfulfilled the originally planned earth and stone work task for this winter and spring water conservancy construction. On the basis of this victory, the province has put forward a new water conservancy construction plan, and the laborers participating in water conservancy construction are ambitiously striving to complete this new task again ahead of schedule.

At present, all completed water storage projects in the province have been inspected and accepted, and have begun storing water. The total water storage capacity of new and old projects has reached 6.05 billion cubic meters, which can guarantee the water needs of spring-sown crops and spring irrigation of wheat.

The work efficiency of winter and spring water conservancy construction in Anhui Province has improved rapidly. Since the start of construction last winter, the Party committees at all levels have firmly grasped the important link of reforming water control tools, leading the laborers to carry out a high work efficiency movement. The experience of setting up factories at construction sites has been widely promoted. Wherever water conservancy construction goes, tool manufacturing factories are set up there. Tool reform work has been done in the process of creating, using, improving and enhancing. At present, there are more than 2.5 million various improved tools used on the water conservancy front throughout the province, an increase of more than 700,000 compared with the beginning of December last year. Now the average daily work efficiency of the laborers in the province has increased from about 2 cubic meters at the beginning to more than 13 cubic meters.

Hunan

The more than 860,000 small-scale water conservancy projects planned for winter repair in Hunan have all been completed before the Spring Festival. Among the more than 30,000 newly built small reservoirs, more than 23,000 have been equipped with canals and spillways, achieving complete projects. More than 50 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects built throughout the province have also been basically completed, of which 25 have achieved complete projects. The earth and stone work done by the province in building these projects is 60% more than the earth and stone work completed in the previous winter and spring. Recently, while focusing on the completion of projects, all localities have focused on water storage and conservation and the management and maintenance of projects. More than 70% of the new and old water conservancy projects in the province have begun to store water.

At the beginning of the winter water conservancy repair movement, the Provincial Party Committee put forward the slogans of early preparation, early start of construction, early completion, early benefit, and ensuring quality, ensuring economy, and ensuring safety. In implementing this policy and requirements, all localities adopted the method of phased blitzes. In the first stage, while grasping large and medium-sized projects, they concentrated their main forces on the small-scale projects. In the second stage, while grasping the finishing and supporting work of small-scale projects, they concentrated their main forces on building large and medium-sized projects.

    保证春耕用水  赶上春汛防洪
    广东浙江安徽湖南等省冬春水利工程超额完成计划
    广东
    广东省到春节前夕已经完成大大小小水利工程二十一万多处，增加和改善排灌面积一千零七十二万亩，原订土石方工程计划已经超额57％提前完成。
    广东省这个冬春的水利建设，进一步贯彻了以蓄为主、社办为主、小型为主、大中小结合的方针。全省兴建的二十一万多处小型工程，绝大部分已经完成；在蓄水一亿立方米以上的大型水库中，已经全部完成或基本完成的，有鹤地、小江、良德、大沙河、汤溪、大隆垌、公平、三合等多处；在受益万亩以上的四百八十五处重点工程中，已经全部完成或基本完成的有二百九十八处，其余绝大部分预计也都可以在春耕或春汛前完成，赶上春耕用水和防洪的需要。
    目前，全省仍有三万多处大小水利工程在继续施工，治水战线上的民工们决心以更大的毅力，更快的速度，力争水利运动全胜。
    浙江
    浙江省已有十八万二千多处中小型水利工程在春节前完工，并且开始蓄水。根据到1月21日止的统计，全省原订的水利冬修土石方任务已经超额完成，已经完成的土石方超过去年同期一倍多。
    全省在水利运动中，充分利用水力资源，节节拦水发电，已经建起水电站四百零六处，总装机容量达一万多瓩；建成水力加工站五百八十六处，共七千四百多马力。
    在前一阶段取得巨大成就的基础上，目前全省各地正在继续大鼓干劲，集中主要力量狠抓大中型工程的施工，达到工程成套，充分发挥工程效益。
    安徽
    安徽省在春节以前已经修成河道一千二百一十三条（共长四千六百六十公里），建成水库一千六百七十四座，完成塘坝、沟渠、涵闸等工程十七万三千多处，已经超额完成了原订这个冬春水利建设的土石方任务。在这个胜利的基础上，全省又提出了新的水利建设计划，参加水利建设的民工们正在雄心勃勃地争取再次提前完成这个新的任务。
    目前，全省已经完成的各项蓄水工程，经检查验收，都已开始蓄水，新旧工程总蓄水量已达六十亿五千万立方米，能够保证春种作物用水和小麦春灌的需要。
    安徽省冬春水利建设的工效提高得很快。从去冬开工以来，各级党委就狠狠地抓住了治水工具改革这一重要环节，领导民工开展了高工效运动。各地普遍推行工地办工厂的经验，水利兴修到哪里，工具制造厂就设到哪里，工具改革工作做到了边创制、边使用，边改进、边提高。现在，全省水利战线上使用的各种改良工具有二百五十多万件，比去年12月初增加七十多万件。现在全省民工平均日工效已由开始时的二立方米左右提高到十三立方米以上。
    湖南
    湖南各地计划冬修的八十六万多处小型水利工程春节前已经全部完工，其中新建的三万多座小型水库，已有两万三千多座修了渠道和溢洪道，达到了工程成套；各地兴建的大中型水利工程也有五十多项基本完工，其中有二十五项做到了工程成套。全省兴修这些工程所做的土石方，比前一个冬春完成的土石方还多60％。最近，各地在突击工程配套的同时，大抓蓄水保水和工程管理养护工作。全省新旧水利工程已有70％以上开始蓄水。
    在水利冬修运动开始的时候，省委就提出了早准备、早开工、早完工、早受益，和保质量、保节约、保安全等的口号。各地在贯彻执行这个方针和要求中，采取了分段突击的办法。第一阶段在抓紧大中型工程的同时，集中主要力量，突击小型工程；第二阶段在抓紧小型工程扫尾、配套的同时，集中主要力量修建大中型工程。
