    Using Machines to Sweep Streets
    Technical Revolution of Beijing's Sanitation Workers
    (Our dispatch) Beijing's urban road sanitation workers have recently created many kinds of mechanized and semi-mechanized cleaning tools, greatly improving the efficiency of street cleaning and reducing the physical labor of sanitation workers.
    In the past, sanitation workers swept the streets with a large broom that was more than two meters long and weighed more than seven pounds, constantly swinging it back and forth, sweeping from a little after one o'clock in the morning until dawn. Now, some road sanitation workers have put down these heavy brooms and are using self-made hand-pushed road sweepers, foot-pedaled tricycle road sweepers, and motorcycle tricycle road sweepers to clean the streets. According to statistics from Xicheng and Chongwen districts, after using hand-pushed fan-style road sweepers and tricycle road sweepers, eighty-five sanitation workers easily and happily replaced the labor of one hundred and fifteen people in the past, and the cleaning time was also shorter than before. In Dongcheng District, sanitation workers used a motorcycle tricycle road sweeper to clean a street as long as twenty li, and two workers only took an hour and a half. In the past, it generally took seven strong laborers five hours of continuous sweeping to complete the task.
    These mechanized and semi-mechanized cleaning tools were all successfully designed and repeatedly studied by sanitation workers under the leadership of the Party, constantly breaking superstitions and liberating their minds. Their educational level is relatively low, and they cannot draw blueprints. However, a strong desire to contribute more to the cause of socialist construction inspired them, enabling them to finally overcome various difficulties and successfully trial-produce these tools. Gao Xianglin, the sanitation worker who created the tricycle road sweeper, only had a second-grade elementary school education. He designed a foot-pedaled tricycle road sweeper based on the principle of the waterwheel in his hometown. This road sweeper can not only greatly reduce the labor intensity of workers, but also replace the labor of three or four people in the past.

### 用机器清扫街道  北京清扫工人技术大革新

    用机器清扫街道
    北京清扫工人技术大革新
    本报讯　北京城区道路清扫工人，最近创制了许多种机械化和半机械化的清扫工具，大大提高了清扫街道的效率，减轻了清扫工人的体力劳动。
    过去，清扫工人扫除街道，手里拿的是一把两米多长、七斤多重的大扫帚，不停地来回地抡着扫，从深夜一点多钟一直扫到黎明。现在，部分道路清扫工人已经放下了这种笨重的大扫帚，用自己制造成功的手推式扫路机、脚蹬三轮扫路机和摩托三轮扫路机等工具来清扫街道。据西城、崇文两区统计，使用手推风车式扫路机和三轮扫路机以后，八十五个清扫工人就轻松愉快地代替了过去一百一十五人的劳动，而且清扫时间也比过去缩短了。东城区清扫工人用摩托三轮扫路机清扫一条长达二十华里的街道，两个工人只用了一个半小时，过去，一般需要七个壮劳动力不停地清扫五个小时才能扫完。
    这些机械化和半机械化清扫工具，都是清扫工人在党的领导下，不断地破除迷信，解放思想，反复研究设计成功的。他们的文化水平都较低，不会画图样。但是，一种为社会主义建设事业贡献出更大力量的强烈愿望，鼓舞着他们，使他们终于克服各种各样的困难，试制成功这些工具。创造三轮扫路机的清扫工人高祥林，只有高小二年级文化程度。他按照家乡水车的原理，设计成一种脚蹬三轮扫路机。这种扫路机，不仅能够大大减轻工人劳动强度，而且可以代替过去三、四个人的劳动。
