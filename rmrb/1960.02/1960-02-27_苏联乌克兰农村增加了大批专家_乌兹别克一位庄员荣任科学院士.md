Soviet Ukrainian Countryside Adds Large Number of Experts
Uzbek Collective Farm Member Becomes Academician

According to materials from the Statistical Bureau of the Ukrainian Republic, each collective farm and state farm in Ukraine now has an average of six experts such as agronomists, breeders, and veterinarians. Their total number in collective farms alone has increased tenfold compared to 1953.

As collective farms have become technically equipped economic units, with an average of thirty tractors, combine harvesters, and other machines per collective farm, new professionals have emerged in Ukrainian collective farms—mechanical engineers. In 1959 alone, about six thousand mechanical engineers and technicians were sent to work in the countryside.

Gani Mavlyanov, who was an ordinary collective farm member thirty years ago, has now become an academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Uzbek Republic.

After graduating from the Central Asian Institute of Technology, Mavlyanov devoted himself to studying groundwater problems, as cotton cultivation in Uzbekistan requires water. He wrote forty-five works on this issue.

Mavlyanov obtained a doctorate in geological and mineralogical sciences. Through specific analysis of groundwater sources, he and his students discovered a large number of underground water sources.

    苏联乌克兰农村增加了大批专家
    乌兹别克一位庄员荣任科学院士
    据乌克兰共和国统计局的材料，现在乌克兰每一个集体农庄和国营农场平均有六名农艺师、饲养家、兽医等专家。仅在集体农庄中，他们的总人数比1953年便增加了十倍。
    随着集体农庄已经成为有技术设备的经济单位，并且每一个集体农庄平均都有三十台拖拉机、联合收割机等机器，现在乌克兰集体农庄中出现了新的专业人员——机械工程师。在1959年一年内，约有六千名机械工程师和技术员被派到农村工作。
    三十年前曾经是一位普通的集体农庄庄员的加尼·马夫里亚诺夫，现在当上了乌兹别克共和国科学院院士。
    马夫里亚诺夫在中央亚细亚工艺学院毕业后，便献身于研究地下水问题，乌兹别克种植棉花需要水。他写了四十五部关于这一问题的著作。
    马夫里亚诺夫获得了地质矿物学博士的学位。通过对地下水源的具体分析，他和他的学生们发现了大量的地下水源。
