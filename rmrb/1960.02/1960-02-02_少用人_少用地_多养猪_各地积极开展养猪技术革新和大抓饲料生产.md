Xinhua News Agency report:
Throughout the country, a technological innovation movement in pig raising is underway. Vigorously promoting technological innovation in pig raising and vigorously developing feed production to achieve less labor, less land, more pigs, and better pigs are the keys to further promoting the high-speed development of the pig raising industry at present.

The nationwide pig raising upsurge has long since taken shape, and the pig raising industry is developing rapidly in various regions. In Changsha County, Hunan Province, in the first half of this year, the number of pigs raised surged from 810,000 at the end of last year to over 890,000, an increase of nearly 10% in half a month. In the midst of the great development of the pig raising industry, the need for labor and feed has greatly increased. For this reason, various regions have launched mass technological innovation in pig raising and vigorously developed feed production. According to typical surveys, currently, one laborer can generally raise 15 to 20 pigs, which is not very efficient. However, in places where pig raising technology has been innovated and pig raising tools have been reformed, work efficiency has been significantly improved. In Meitan County, Guizhou Province, 2,965 large and small pig farms have implemented large-scale penning and established pig canteens. New-style large pots connected to stoves, carts, pulleys and other simple tools were used for cooking materials, water, feeding, and cleaning the pens. At the end of 1959, the county raised more than 580,000 pigs, an increase of 67.8% compared with the number at the end of 1958, while the number of feeders was reduced from more than 29,000 to more than 18,000. The Wanto Pig Farm in Shushan Commune, Hefei City, Anhui Province, uses pig manure as biogas raw material and biogas to steam pig feed, saving 1,200 yuan in fuel costs and 685 labor days for transporting coal and steaming each month. The country has created and promoted many simple pig raising machinery tools and advanced feeding management experiences, greatly improving the work efficiency of pig raising. For example, Wu Jibin, a carpenter from the Datuo Commune Wanto Pig Farm in Changsha County, Hunan Province, created an electric vegetable cutting machine that cuts 6,000 kilograms of feed per hour, increasing work efficiency by 150 times compared with manual knife cutting. After this farm realized the carting of swill (pig feed), an average of more than 110 pigs were raised per person. Due to the integration of tool reform and the implementation of pig canteens at the Tianjin Workers and Peasants Alliance Livestock Farm, and the adoption of the method of feeding in batches and shifts, the average number of pigs raised per person has increased from 80 to 300.

There are also many creations in solving the problem of feed. Under the policy of "mainly green and coarse feed, supplemented with appropriate fine feed," various regions have implemented the "five-pronged approach" and the "four combinations" according to different regions and different conditions, and have widely opened up feed sources in accordance with local conditions. The "five-pronged approach" is: green and coarse feed and fine feed go hand in hand, retaining pig grain and fully utilizing by-products of agricultural and sideline product processing go hand in hand, establishing dedicated feed land and utilizing idle land and planting (intercropping) in large fields go hand in hand, planting feed and collecting wild feed go hand in hand, and aquatic and terrestrial feed go hand in hand. The "four combinations" are: seasonal concentrated collection is combined with regular storage of feed, universally improving feed land yield is combined with promoting high-yield feed crops, mass movement of feed production is combined with professional teams, and pig house feeding is combined with grazing. All these methods have been effective in various regions.

The rapid development of technological innovation and vigorous feed work is mainly due to putting politics in command and launching mass movements. At present, party committees in various regions have adopted the two-pronged approach of combining indigenous and foreign methods, from indigenous to foreign, from low-level to high-level, and from simple to complex in leading the reform of pig raising tools. At the same time, they have also adopted the method of first reforming the work processes that require a lot of labor and are heavy, focusing on breakthroughs, and promoting a comprehensive approach, so the results are remarkable. The National On-site Conference on Pig Raising Tool Reform and Feed Production Experience Exchange recently held in Changsha selected 18 better pig raising tools to be introduced and promoted to the whole country.

    少用人　少用地　多养猪
    各地积极开展养猪技术革新和大抓饲料生产
    新华社讯　全国各地正在开展养猪的技术革新运动。大搞养猪的技术革新，大抓饲料生产，做到少用人、少用地，多养猪、养好猪，是当前进一步促使养猪事业高速度发展的关键。
    全国养猪高潮早已形成，各地养猪业正在猛烈发展。湖南省长沙县今年头半个月，养猪数量就由去年年底存栏八十一万头猛增到八十九万多头，半个月时间增加将近10％。在养猪事业大发展中间，劳动力和饲料的需要大增。为此各地开展了群众性的养猪的技术革新，大抓饲料生产。根据典型调查，目前各地一般一个劳动力可养猪十五头到二十头，效率不高。但是革新了养猪技术和改革了养猪工具的地方，工效都有显著的提高。贵州省湄潭县已有二千九百六十五个大小猪场实行了大圈化，办了猪食堂，煮料、用水、送料、清圈等使用了新式的大锅连灶、车子、滑车等简易工具。1959年年底全县养猪五十八万多头，比1958年年底存栏数增加67．8％，而饲养人员反由原来的两万九千多人减少为一万八千多。安徽省合肥市郊蜀山公社万头猪场利用猪粪作沼气原料，用沼气蒸煮猪饲料，每月节约燃料费一千二百元，节省运煤和蒸煮用工六百八十五个劳动日。全国已创造、推广了许多简易的养猪机械工具和先进的饲养管理经验，大大提高养猪的工效。如湖南省长沙县大托公社万头猪场木工吴积斌等创制的一台电动切菜机，每小时切六千斤饲料，比人工用刀切提高工效一百五十倍。这个场实现运潲（猪食）车子化后，平均每人养猪达一百一十多头。天津工农联盟畜牧场由于结合工具改革推行猪食堂，采取分批轮流喂养的办法，平均每人养猪已由八十头提高到三百头。
    解决饲料方面也有不少创造。在“以青粗饲料为主、适当搭配精饲料”的方针下，各地根据不同地区、不同条件，实行“五个并举”和“四个结合”的办法，因地制宜地广辟饲料来源。“五个并举”是：青粗饲料与精饲料并举，留猪粮与充分利用农副产品加工的副产品并举，建立专用饲料地与利用闲田隙地、大田插种（间作）并举，种植饲料与采集野生饲料并举，水、陆饲料并举。“四个结合”是：季节性的突击采集与经常收贮饲料相结合，普遍提高饲料地产量与推广高产饲料作物相结合，饲料生产群众性的运动与专业队相结合，猪舍饲养与放牧相结合。所有这些办法各地都已经行之有效。
    技术革新和大抓饲料工作的迅速展开，主要是由于政治挂帅和大搞群众运动。目前各地党委在领导养猪工具改革中间，都采取了土洋并举、由土到洋、由低级到高级、由简单到复杂的两条腿走路的方针，同时还采取了首先改革用工多、劳动重的工序，重点突破，推动全面的办法，因而成效显著。最近在长沙召开的全国养猪工具改革和饲料生产经验交流现场会议，就评选出十八件较好的养猪工具，要向全国介绍推广。
