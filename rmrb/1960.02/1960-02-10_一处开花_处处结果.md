The advanced experiences created by the Tongjialiang Store in Datong City, Shanxi Province, in organizing economic life and supporting production are like the first sprig of spring blossoms blooming at the end of winter and the beginning of spring. Its emergence has brought a spring breeze to commercial work in industrial, mining, and forestry areas across the country. "Tongjialiang" flowers are blooming everywhere, and "Tongjialiang Stores" have sprung up everywhere.

One blossom, results everywhere—this illustrates the enormous role of creating advanced experiences and the profound significance of learning from and catching up with the advanced. Without the creativity of the "Tongjialiang" commercial employees, there would be no first fragrant spring blossom; without the wave of learning from and catching up with "Tongjialiang," there would be no spring breeze and flower-filled gardens in commercial work in industrial, mining, and forestry areas across the country. Creation and learning both play a tremendous role in promoting the rapid development of our socialist construction. Marxists believe that creation is great. Its greatness lies in its demonstration of the possibility of further development in our production and work, and in raising the first red flag. However, for any new creation to become a force for promoting the work of the entire society or a certain aspect of it, it still requires the efforts of the entire society to accept and promote it, enrich and develop it. Precisely for this reason, we must not only have "creation" but also "learning," so that every new creation can have a significant impact on social progress through learning and promotion. The "Tongjialiang Store" delivered goods needed by miners to the bottom of the pit, excellently supporting the Tongjialiang Coal Mine to achieve the "ten-thousand-ton mine" level every month; the "Military Supply Service Station" at Bakongzha, the Guangfudao Store, and the advanced commercial service departments emerging in various places have all tried every possible means to meet the needs of urban people's economic lives in many ways, greatly improving the face of urban people's lives. The impact of socialist commercial work on economic construction is thus evident.

In the process of creatively learning from the experience of Tongjialiang in various places, there are some common characteristics. One of the characteristics is that they have closely combined economic work and political work. Everything is for production, starts from production, and tries every means to support production, becoming a capable "logistics department" for the production sector. The second characteristic is that they have taken on the organizational work of mass life. Everything starts from facilitating the masses, leaving difficulties to themselves, bringing convenience to the masses, and doing whatever the masses need, becoming good "housekeepers" for the broad masses. The third characteristic is that the relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation between people has become closer. They go deep into the masses and care for the masses as they care for their relatives. The touching deeds of the "Military Supply Service Station" at the Bakongzha construction site most vividly illustrate this point.

From these common characteristics, a truth is revealed: there is no end to the service of commercial work to production and the people's economic life. Our country's production is developing rapidly, and the economic living standards of the broad masses of people are increasing day by day. As a link connecting production and consumption, and as an important department for organizing the people's economic life, the task of commercial workers is not only to adapt to the objective situation of the prosperity and prosperity of the national economy, but also to further promote it. Especially doing the work of people. People are the decisive factor in productivity. If commercial work serves them well, making them feel comfortable and happy, it can encourage their enthusiasm for labor and better promote the development of production.

Commercial institutions are spread all over the vast rural areas and every corner of the cities across the country, and commercial workers come into contact with the broad masses of people hundreds of times every day. If every commercial work unit and every commercial worker across the country can learn from Tongjialiang, Bakongzha, and Guangfudao stores, then a new situation will definitely emerge in the economic life of the people across the country, and a new situation will definitely emerge in commercial work.

    一处开花　处处结果
    张树
    山西大同市同家梁商店创造的一套组织经济生活，支援生产的先进经验，恰像开放在冬末春初的第一枝报春花。它一出现，就带来了全国工矿林区商业工作的一片春光。到处竞开着“同家梁”的花朵，到处都出现了“同家梁商店”。
    一处开花，处处结果，这说明了创造先进经验的巨大作用，也说明了学、赶先进的深邃意义。没有“同家梁”商业职工的创造，就没有第一枝香气喷鼻的报春花；没有学、赶“同家梁”的热浪，就没有全国工矿林区商业工作的春光一片，花开满园。创造与学习，两者对于促进我国社会主义建设事业的飞跃发展，都有着莫大的作用。马克思主义者认为：创造是伟大的。其所以伟大，是它给我们生产、工作展示了更进一步向前发展的可能，擎起了第一面红旗。但是，任何一个新的创造要成为推进整个社会或某一方面工作的力量，还有待于全社会的努力，接受并推广它，丰富和发展它。正因为这样，所以我们不仅要有“创造”，而且要有“学习”，通过学习、推广，使每一项新的创造都成为对社会进步发生重大的影响。“同家梁商店”把矿工需要的商品送到井下，出色地支援了同家梁煤矿月月达到“万吨矿”的水平；八孔闸“随军供应服务站”、光复道商店和各地涌现的先进商业服务部门，都是千方百计地多方面满足了城市人民经济生活的需要，大大地改善了城市人民生活的面貌。社会主义商业工作对经济建设影响之大于此可见。
    各地创造性地学习同家梁的经验中，有着一些共同的特点。特点之一，他们把经济工作和政治工作牢牢地结合起来了。一切为了生产，从生产出发，想尽一切办法支持生产，成为生产部门得力的“后勤部”；特点之二，他们把群众生活的组织工作担当起来了。一切从方便群众出发，把困难留给自己，把方便带给群众，凡是群众需要的就做，成为广大群众的好“管家人”；特点之三，人与人之间的互助合作关系进一步密切了，他们深入群众，像关心亲人一样地关心群众。八孔闸工地“随军供应服务站”的感人事迹，最生动不过地说明了这个问题。
    从上述这些共同特点中，表现出一个真理，那就是：商业工作为生产、为人民经济生活服务是没有止境的。我们国家生产正在飞速发展，广大人民经济生活水平日益提高。作为联系生产和消费的纽带、作为组织人民经济生活的重要部门，商业工作者的任务不仅是要适应国民经济繁荣兴旺的客观形势，而且还必须进一步促进它。特别是做人的工作。人是生产力的决定因素，商业工作为他们服务得好使他们心情舒畅，精神愉快，就可以鼓舞他们的劳动热情，更好地促进生产的发展。
    商业机构遍布全国广大农村和城市的每一个角落，商业工作人员每天成百次地和广大人民群众发生接触。如果全国每个商业工作单位、每个商业工作人员都能学习同家梁、八孔闸和光复道商店，那么，全国人民的经济生活一定会出现一个崭新的局面，商业工作也一定会出现一个崭新的局面。
