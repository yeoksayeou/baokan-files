Ten miles of green mountains, red flags waving,
Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) unleashes a new high tide,
Ten thousand heroes chase the wind and seize the day,
Who cares about the snow fluttering in the freezing winter?

Whether day or night,
The drums of war are always booming,
A high tide of technical innovation,
You run, I fly, neither giving way.

You can shoulder a thousand catties of burden,
I can broaden my shoulders to carry a mountain;
You call for molten iron to roll like the Yangtze River,
I call for the red glow of the coke oven to lock in the sun.

Steel blossoms welcome the spring,
In spring, a hundred flowers bloom;
One news of victory, one flower,
Ten miles of steel city, a garden full of flowers.

Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation Worker Wang Dongshan

    十里钢城花满园青山十里红旗摇，武钢掀起新高潮，十万英雄追风跨日，谁管数九寒天雪花飘。不论白天或晚上，战鼓总是咚咚响，技术革新浪潮高，你跑我飞不相让。你能挑起千斤担，我能展肩把山扛；你叫铁水滚滚赛长江，我叫焦炉红光锁太阳。钢花迎来了春天，春天里百花争艳；一张捷报一朵花，十里钢城花满园。
    武钢工人　王东山
