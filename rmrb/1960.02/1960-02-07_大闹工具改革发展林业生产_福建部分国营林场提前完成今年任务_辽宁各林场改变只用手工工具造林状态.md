Vigorously Carry Out Tool Reform to Develop Forestry Production
    Fujian Province: Some State-Owned Forest Farms Complete This Year's Tasks Ahead of Schedule
    Liaoning Province: Forest Farms Change the Situation of Only Using Manual Tools for Afforestation

    (Our Newspaper's Report) Thanks to the vigorous tool reform which accelerated forestry production, some state-owned farms in Fujian Province have completed their afforestation tasks for 1960 ahead of schedule. In 1959, the afforestation tasks of state-owned forest farms in Fujian were quite heavy. In addition, young forest tending, seed collection, and winter land preparation required more than four million labor days, but there were only over 10,000 employees, a labor shortage of about 1.6 million. Faced with this labor shortage, under the leadership of the Party, state-owned forest farms throughout the province adopted the approach of going from low to high, from easy to difficult, from indigenous to foreign, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. They boldly mobilized the masses and launched a mass movement of forestry tool reform in which everyone used their brains and offered suggestions. During the movement, there were three to five upsurges of forestry tool reform, which led to a leap in the reform of forestry production tools. By the end of 1959, according to incomplete statistics from seventeen state-owned forest farms in the province, 250 forestry tools of various kinds had been created and reformed (190 afforestation tools, 5 seed collection tools, 18 seedling cultivation tools, and 37 tending tools).
    Due to the vigorous tool reform, the development of forestry production was accelerated. The double-sided tending grass-cutting knife, land preparation hoe, and Chinese fir seeder created and reformed by the Zhaixia Forest Farm in Pucheng County can all increase work efficiency by two to five times. Due to the large-scale use and promotion of these new tools in tending and land preparation, more than 9,000 labor days were saved throughout the year, saving more than 47,000 yuan in funds, reducing investment by 46.2%, and completing the annual young forest tending task five months ahead of schedule, exceeding the 1960 afforestation task by 25%. The Dazhuang Forest Farm in Pucheng County launched four upsurges of tool innovation, creating and reforming more than 60 kinds of forestry tools during 30 days of hard work by all employees. More than 510 pieces of these tools were used and promoted. Although these tools were all made of iron and wood, combining "indigenous and foreign methods," they worked very well, generally increasing work efficiency by two to five times, with the highest reaching twenty times. The new forestry tools such as the soil-crushing rake, weeding hoe, afforestation hoe, and grass-cutting hoe created and reformed by the Yulong Forest Farm in Qingning County generally increased work efficiency by one to two times. Because of the tool reform, coupled with the workers' soaring enthusiasm, the number of holes dug per person per day increased from six fen of land to one and a half mu, saving 29,088 labor days in land preparation alone. The cost of afforestation per mu was reduced from 5.8 yuan to 2.8 yuan, saving more than 30,000 yuan in investment throughout the year, and completing the 1960 afforestation task ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.
    (Our Newspaper's Report) State-owned forest farms, nurseries, and people's commune forest farms in Liaoning Province, due to the widespread launch of the forestry tool reform movement, have basically changed the backward state of forestry production that has long existed in the past, where only manual tools were used. Some forestry production units have already begun to adopt semi-mechanized and mechanized production.
    In 1959, forestry production in Liaoning Province required a total of 51.8 million workdays, while the number of laborers allocated by the province could only meet about half of the required number. In order to meet the requirements of the continued great leap forward in forestry production, the province universally launched an organized and guided large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on tool reform. In reforming tools, all localities resolutely implemented the Party's policy of relying on the masses, self-reliance, indigenous methods first, combining indigenous and foreign methods, comprehensive reform, and continuous reform, and extensively and deeply mobilized the masses, thereby making the tool reform movement flourish throughout the province and achieving great results. In the past two years, more than 10,000 kinds of forestry production tools have been improved, created, and promoted throughout the province, which has greatly promoted the accelerated development of forestry production and completed the afforestation task for 1959 ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.

    大闹工具改革发展林业生产
    福建部分国营林场提前完成今年任务
    辽宁各林场改变只用手工工具造林状态
    本报讯　福建省各国营林场由于大搞工具改革，加速了林业生产，部分国营农场已提前完成1960年的造林任务。1959年福建国营林场的造林任务较大，再加上幼林抚育、采种和冬季整地等约需四百多万劳动日，但职工只有一万多人，相差劳力约一千六百人，任务很难完成。面对这种劳力不足的困难，在党的领导下，全省国营林场采取由低到高、由易到难、由土到洋、土洋结合的方针，放手发动群众，开展人人动脑、个个献策的群众性的营林工具改革运动。在运动中前后掀起三到五次营林工具改革高潮，使林业生产工具改革获得了飞跃发展。到1959年底，据全省十七个国营林场的不完全统计，创造和改革各种营林工具二百五十项（造林工具一百九十项，采种工具五项，育苗工具十八项，抚育工具三十七项）。
    由于大闹林具改革，加速了林业生产的发展。蒲城县寨下林场创造改革的双面抚育劈草刀、整地锄、杉木播种机，都能提高工效二至五倍。由于在抚育整地中大量使用和推广了这些新工具，全年节约九千多个劳动日，节约资金四万七千多元，减少投资46．2％，并且提前五个月完成全年幼林抚育任务，超额25％完成了1960年的造林任务。蒲城县大庄林场，前后掀起四次工具革新高潮，在全场职工苦战三十天当中，创造和革新各种林具六十多项，使用并推广新林具达五百一十件。这些工具虽然都是铁木结构，“土洋结合”的，但效果很好，普遍提高工效二至五倍，最高可达二十倍。清宁县鱼龙林场创造改革的碎土耙、拔草锄、造林锄、劈草镐等新式林具，普遍提高工效一至二倍。这个林场因为工具改革，再加上工人的冲天干劲，每人每天挖穴从六分地增加到一亩半，仅整地一项就节约两万九千零八十八个劳动日，每亩造林成本从五元八角降低到二元八角，全年节约投资三万多元，并提前超额完成了1960年的造林任务。
    本报讯　辽宁省各国营林场、苗圃和人民公社林场，由于普遍地开展林业工具改革运动，已经基本上改变了林业生产上过去长期存在的只用手工工具操作的落后状态，有些林业生产单位，已经开始采用半机械化和机械化生产。
    1959年辽宁省林业生产共需要五千一百八十万个工日，而省里分配的劳力工数，仅能满足需要数的一半左右。为了适应林业生产继续跃进的要求，全省普遍开展了有组织、有领导的，大规模的以工具改革为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。在改革工具中，各地坚决执行了党的依靠群众、自力更生、土法上马、土洋结合、全面改革、不断改革的方针，广泛深入地发动群众，从而使工具改革运动在全省蓬勃地开展起来，并且取得了巨大成绩。两年来，全省改进、创造并加以推广的各种林业生产工具已有一万多件，对加速林业生产发展起了很大的推动作用，提前超额完成了1959年的造林任务。
