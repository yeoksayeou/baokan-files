Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, February 17th: Fang Fang and Zhuang Xiquan, Deputy Directors of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China and members of the Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China, Zhuang Mingli, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, and Wang Hanjie, Director of the Fujian Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and Deputy Director of the Fujian Provincial Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese, recently inspected the preparations for receiving and settling returned Overseas Chinese in various Overseas Chinese hometowns in Fujian.

Fang Fang and others first went to Fuqing County and Yongchun County, where many relatives of Overseas Chinese from Indonesia reside, for inspection. Yongchun County has established reception and settlement organizations for returned Overseas Chinese in the county and the key Overseas Chinese hometown of Dongping Commune, and has begun expanding the state-owned Beikeng Overseas Chinese Farm and Yongchun Tea Farm as settlement bases. They are now actively engaged in basic construction, surveying, and land reclamation. At the same time, it was decided to establish several new residential areas along the roadsides in the Overseas Chinese hometowns of Taiping and Dongguan, and a large number of beds and furniture have been prepared to receive and settle large numbers of returned Overseas Chinese at any time. Fang Fang expressed satisfaction with these preparations. When he spoke with the farm members at Yongchun Tea Farm, he asked them to provide "four helps" to the new returned Overseas Chinese, namely "help solve difficulties, help ideological progress, help learn production techniques, and help become familiar with domestic life."

Fang Fang and others inspected the Dongshi Salt Field in Jinjiang County, which is under construction. The initial seawall enclosure project of this salt field is nearing completion. Currently, more than 2,000 laborers are working on the overall site, and the entire 35,000 mu salt field will be completed and put into production before June this year. Initially, it will produce more than 35,000 tons of crude salt annually, and later this can be increased to more than 70,000 tons. This salt field will continue to be expanded in the future, and a tidal power station with a generating capacity of 30,000 kilowatts will be built, and aquaculture will be greatly developed, making it suitable as a base for settling returned Overseas Chinese. Fang Fang said: Since liberation, the appearance of Overseas Chinese hometowns along the coast of Fujian has undergone fundamental changes. The work of settling returned Overseas Chinese should be combined with the development of production in Overseas Chinese hometowns. This is not only conducive to settling returned Overseas Chinese, but also conducive to accelerating the construction of Overseas Chinese hometowns. There are great prospects for coastal reclamation, and with the development of reclamation, returned Overseas Chinese can be well settled in their hometowns.

    事事皆就绪　等待亲人归
    方方等在福建视察安置归侨准备工作
    新华社福州17日电　中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会副主任、中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会委员方方、庄希泉，中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会副主任庄明理和福建省华侨事务委员会主任、福建省接待和安置归国华侨委员会副主任王汉杰，最近在福建侨乡各地视察了接待和安置归国华侨的准备工作。
    方方等首先到印度尼西亚华侨眷属众多的福清县和永春县视察。永春县已经在县里和重点侨乡东平公社成立了归国华侨接待和安置机构，并着手扩建国营北硿华侨农场、永春茶场作为安置基地，现在正在积极进行基本建设和勘察、开垦等工作。同时决定在侨乡太平、东关等地靠公路两旁建立几个新的居民点，并已准备好大批床铺、家具，以便随时接待和安置大批归侨。方方对这些准备工作表示满意，他在永春茶场同场员们谈话时，要求场员们对来场的新归国华侨们进行“四帮”，即“帮助解决困难，帮助思想进步，帮助学习生产技术，帮助熟悉国内生活”。
    方方等到晋江县视察了正在兴建中的晋江东石盐场。这个盐场初期围筑海堤工程即将完成，目前二千多个民工正在进行整场工作，今年6月以前三万五千公亩盐场即可全部建成并投入生产，初期每年可产原盐三万五千吨以上，以后可提高到七万吨以上。这个盐场将来还要继续扩大，并将建设一个拥有三万瓩发电量的潮力发电站，和大量发展水产养殖业，适合于作为安置归国华侨的一个基地。方方说：解放以来，福建沿海侨乡的面貌已经起了根本的变化。安置归侨的工作应该和发展侨乡生产结合起来，这样既有利于安置归侨，又有利于加速侨乡建设。沿海的围垦事业大有前途，围垦事业发展了，归国华侨可以在自己的家乡得到很好的安置。
