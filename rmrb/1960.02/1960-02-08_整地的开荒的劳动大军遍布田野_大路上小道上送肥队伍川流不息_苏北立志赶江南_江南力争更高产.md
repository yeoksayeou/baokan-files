Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 7th: In Jiangsu's rural areas, a magnificent competition, "Northern Jiangsu Vows to Catch Up with Southern Jiangsu, Southern Jiangsu Strives for Even Higher Yields," has ignited a vigorous upsurge in preparatory work. Now, a fervent atmosphere prevails throughout both the southern and northern regions. Under the slogan "Seize the Time, Race Against the Clock, Comprehensively Prepare for Spring Farming," the vast number of cadres and commune members are displaying renewed vigor, redoubling their efforts. Fertilizer transport teams flow endlessly on the main roads and small paths, while labor armies reclaiming wasteland and leveling land are spread across the fields.

In the southern Yangtze River region of Suzhou Prefecture, representatives dispatched to "learn from experience" in various areas are introducing high-yield experiences and imparting production techniques. Simultaneously, they are proposing the slogan "Maintain and Intensify Enthusiasm, Add Measure Upon Measure, Aspire Greatly to Win the Championship," fully preparing for the comprehensive promotion of advanced technologies. Each county in the prefecture has established a technical reform office to strengthen technical guidance and promote advanced experiences. At the same time, they have convened on-site meetings for agricultural technical cadres and production experts from top to bottom, training a large number of agricultural technical backbones at each level. The plan is to train over 200,000 people, ensuring one technician for every 25 mu of land, forming a complete technical promotion network.

In Yancheng Prefecture, which has proposed "Leaping Out of Yancheng to Catch Up with Southern Jiangsu," measures such as "Surpassing Southern Jiangsu in Every Aspect" and "Dividing the Battle to Catch Up with Southern Jiangsu" have been adopted, progressively deepening the preparatory work. Before the Spring Festival, the first secretary of the prefectural party committee led the first secretaries of the county party committees and responsible cadres from various departments of the prefecture, over 30 people in total, to Suzhou Prefecture to "learn and seek treasures." The day before the Spring Festival, upon their return, the prefectural, county, and commune party committees disseminated the "treasure" to the cadres and masses through cadre meetings, telephone conferences, and broadcast rallies. Various localities have proposed the slogan "Learn from the good experiences of Southern Jiangsu, vigorously create grass pond mud," utilizing Suzhou's method of extensively producing grass pond mud to accumulate large quantities of high-quality base fertilizer for spring crops. After the Spring Festival, over 300,000 laborers were mobilized throughout the prefecture, and through five days of intensive work, a large number of grass mud ponds were dug, accumulating over 200 million dan of grass pond mud fertilizer. Combined with other miscellaneous fertilizers, the fertilizer prepared for each mu of spring crops increased by 30% compared to the same period last year.

The people of the Xu (Zhou) Huai (Yin) Plain, having made great ambitions and vowing to catch up with Southern Jiangsu, have proposed the slogans "Early Start Leads to Initiative in All Matters" and "Strive for One Season's Output to Equal One Year," carrying out preparatory work with tremendous enthusiasm. Currently, in Huaiyin Prefecture, winter fallow fields have basically been plowed twice, with 4 million mu adopting "strip ridge deep plowing," generally reaching a depth of over one chi. Over 2.6 million mu of spring planting fields have had base fertilizer applied, with an average application rate of over 250 dan per mu. In order to strive for high yields and abundant harvests, Xuzhou Prefecture, in accordance with the spirit of suiting measures to local conditions and striving for continuous plots, is vigorously promoting regionalized crop layout. Throughout the prefecture, thousand-mu and ten-thousand-mu continuous plots of high-yield crops such as corn, cotton, and sweet potatoes have appeared. In Suining County, the two corn and sweet potato high-yield areas planned on both sides of the Xuhuai Highway, totaling 15,000 mu, are uniform and consistent at a glance.

Driven by the competition "Northern Jiangsu Vows to Catch Up with Southern Jiangsu, Southern Jiangsu Strives for Even Higher Yields," counties and counties, communes and communes, production teams and production teams in both southern and northern Jiangsu have launched preparatory work competitions. Donghai County, after proposing the slogan "Aspire Greatly, Establish Lofty Ambitions, Surpass Ganyu, Catch Up with Suqian, Seize the Provincial Sweet Potato Championship," the county party committee first established a model of deep plowing sweet potato fields in Baita Commune, followed by convening a mobilization meeting to advance towards high sweet potato yields. Through forms such as challenge matches, the ambitions of cadres and masses were greatly encouraged. After twenty days of intensive work, the county's 200,000 mu of sweet potato land was basically plowed, fully meeting the required standards. In Nantong Prefecture, each county is comprehensively innovating cotton planting technology in the competition. The old habit of planting without plowing, practiced in some areas in the past, has been changed this time, and winter plowing of cotton fields has been carried out. While winter plowing, soil improvement has been carried out on low-yield fields. All cotton seeds have been carefully selected, meeting the requirements of being full and plump.

Jiangsu's various localities, in the spirit of "Taking Grain as the Key Link, Comprehensive Leap Forward" and "Combining Multiple Planting and Multiple Harvesting with High-Yield and Multiple Harvesting," planned the planting area of spring crops at each level before the Spring Festival, and rationally adjusted the layout of spring crops according to the natural conditions of different regions. As early as the busy winter production campaign, they started preparing for spring plowing. Up to now, 19 counties and cities, including Ganyu and Yancheng, have completed the winter water conservancy plan ahead of schedule. The province has transformed over 6.7 million mu of low-yield soil; leveled over 5.4 million mu of land; reclaimed over 670,000 mu of wasteland; and the amount of fertilizer accumulated has increased more than twofold compared to the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 7th: Spring plowing and sowing in Fujian are unfolding in advance from south to north. In the Jiulong River and Jinjiang River basins, where the season is earlier, commune members, while continuing to do a good job in preparatory work, have already soaked over 6 million jin of seeds and sowed over 2 million jin. The rice paddies sown earlier are already a lush green.

In spring plowing and sowing, all localities have established spring sowing and seedling raising technical guidance networks and specialized sowing and seedling raising teams, with communes and brigades as units, and have trained a large number of sowing and seedling raising technicians early on, strengthening technical guidance and promoting advanced technologies and fine varieties. The rice paddies already sown in Longxi Prefecture mostly use fine varieties such as "Sandongzao," and widely adopt salt water seed selection, baking soda germination promotion, and drug disinfection, so that rice seeds germinate evenly, emerge quickly, and grow strong. Changtai County has adopted various methods such as establishing seedling raising "model fields" and on-site observation to widely promote advanced technologies such as early seedling raising and strong seedling raising, so that the first batch of nearly 2,000 mu of seedlings generally grow lush and strong. Nan'an County's communes trained 2,600 seedling raising technicians early on, cultivating strong seedlings on a large area. All of the first batch of 150,000 jin of seeds sown have adopted wet seedling raising.

Since last winter, various communes have launched a preparatory upsurge centered on "water, fertilizer, and soil." At present, the area benefited by irrigation, flood control, and waterlogging prevention projects increased by over 2.9 million mu in the province due to water conservancy construction last winter and this spring. Mountain communes in various localities have also transformed over 7.6 million mu of low-yield mountain fields such as rotten mud fields and cold water fields. At the same time, various communes have carried out a fertilizer accumulation campaign centered on pig raising and fertilizer accumulation. Now, the province has an average of over 340 dan of fertilizer per mu of spring crops. In addition to being plowed once last winter, 75% of the spring sowing fields in the province have been deeply plowed, of which 49% have been combined with layered fertilization and soil improvement. Now, various localities are striving for "all-round success" in various preparatory tasks to welcome the busy season of spring plowing.

This newspaper, Kunming, 7th: The mass movement of spring plowing and production of all ethnic groups in Yunnan Province has been launched with great enthusiasm.

Currently, in the valleys of the Lancang River, Honghe River, Nujiang River, Jinsha River, and Ruili River, where the season is earlier, over 50,000 mu of double-cropping early rice have been planted; the rice paddies prepared for middle-season rice are also a lush green. The people of all ethnic groups living here are irrigating and watering manure for the small seedlings, ensuring that every grain becomes a seedling, every plant becomes a seedling, and every seedling is strong, so that they can transplant rice in a timely manner. In central areas such as Kunming, Fumin, and Xundian, the work of deep plowing rice paddies is in full swing. The rice paddies are generally deep plowed by more than one chi; teams of horse-drawn carts and oxcarts are fully loaded with high-quality fertilizer to the rice paddies. The northwestern part of Yunnan has also begun to prepare rice paddies.

This year, Yunnan Province's 17 million mu of rice will further implement rational close planting, increasing from an average of about 35,000 clumps per mu last year to about 45,000 clumps per mu. At the same time, the area of rice fields in the province will increase by 2 million mu compared to last year. Therefore, the area of rice paddies in the province will also increase from more than 1.3 million mu last year to more than 2.2 million mu.

With the further comprehensive promotion of rational close planting, the amount of water conservancy irrigation, fertilizer, and seeds required will increase accordingly. Last year, the average fertilizer application per mu of rice in the province was about 6,000 jin; this year, it is required to increase to 10,000 jin and improve the quality of fertilizer. Now, the province has accumulated more than 200 billion jin of fertilizer, of which human and animal manure accounts for more than 56%, an increase of 20% compared to the same period last year. The average amount of fertilizer per mu of major spring crops is about 6,000 jin. Last year, the area of cultivated land guaranteed for irrigation in the province was 15 million mu; this year, it is required to increase to 20 million mu. At present, water conservancy has completed more than 190 million cubic meters of earth and stone, equivalent to 183% of the number completed in the same period last year; more than 70,000 large, medium, and small projects have been completed. The province's 17 million mu of rice seeds have basically been retained, and these seeds were retained after ear selection and supplementary selection during the autumn harvest last year.

The preparation of spring plowing farm tools is being stepped up. According to the conditions of Yunnan's hard soil and inconvenient transportation in mountainous areas, more than 1,000 farm tool factories and agricultural machinery factories in the province have imitated and improved more than 1,000 kinds of farm tools, including deep plows, animal-powered three-row seeders, integrated simple rice transplanters, and paddy field plows. The performance of these farm tools is very suitable for the conditions in Yunnan. A tractor-drawn rotary harrow can break up more than 50 mu of soil a day, replacing more than 1,500 laborers.

    整地的开荒的劳动大军遍布田野　大路上小道上送肥队伍川流不息
    苏北立志赶江南　江南力争更高产
    福建由南到北提前春耕春播，南部地区的秧田一片嫩绿
    云南加紧播种育秧，季节较早的河谷里已栽下双季早稻
    新华社南京7日电　江苏农村在“苏北立志赶江南，江南力争更高产”的竞赛运动中，掀起了一个气势壮阔你追我赶的备耕高潮。现在江南江北到处热气腾腾，广大干部和社员在“抢时间，争分秒，全面做好备耕工作”的口号下，人人精神焕发，个个劲上添劲，大路上、小道上送肥的队伍川流不息，开荒的、整地的劳动大军遍布田野。
    长江南岸苏州专区一面向各地去“取经”的代表介绍丰产经验，传授生产技术；一面提出“干劲一鼓再鼓，措施一加再加，立下大志夺冠军”的口号，充分做好全面推广先进技术的各项准备。全专区各个县都成立了技术改革办公室，加强技术指导和推广先进经验，同时，还自上而下召开了各种农业技术干部和生产能手的现场会议，层层训练大量农业技术骨干，全区计划训练二十多万人，做到每二十五亩田都有一名技术员，构成一个完整的技术推广网。
    在提出“跳出盐城赶江南”的盐城专区，采取了“项项措施超江南”、“分段作战赶江南”的措施，备耕工作步步深入。这个专区春节前就由地委第一书记带领县委第一书记和专区各部门的负责干部三十多人到苏州专区“取经求宝”，春节前一天一到家，地委、县委和各公社党委就分别以干部会议，电话会议和广播大会等形式，向干部群众“传经授宝”。各地提出“学习江南的好经验，突击大造草塘泥”的口号，运用苏州大搞草塘泥的办法，为春播作物积造量多质好的基肥。春节过后，全专区出动三十多万个劳力，经过五天突击，挖了大量草泥塘，共积草塘泥肥料二亿多担，连同其它杂肥，为每亩春播作物备好的肥料比去年同期增加30％。
    立下雄心大志、誓赶江南的徐（州）淮（阴）平原人民，提出“早字带头，万事主动”、“力争一季产量顶一年”的口号，备耕工作干得热火朝天。目前，淮阴专区冬闲田已基本上耕了两遍，有四百万亩采取“条垅深翻”后，深度一般都达到一尺以上，有二百六十多万亩春种田施了基肥，施肥量平均每亩达到二百五十多担。徐州专区为了力争高产多收，根据因地制宜力求连片的精神，大力推行作物布局区域化，全专区到处出现了千亩万亩连片的玉米、棉花、甘薯等丰产方和高产片。睢宁县在徐淮公路两侧规划的二片共达一万五千亩的玉米和甘薯丰产地，一眼望去，块块整齐，段段划一。
    在“苏北立志赶江南，江南力争更高产”的竞赛运动推动下，江南、江北各地县与县、公社与公社、生产队与生产队之间都开展了备耕竞赛。东海县提出“立大志，树雄心，超赣榆，赶宿迁，夺取全省甘薯冠军”的口号后，县委首先在白塔公社树立了深翻甘薯田的标兵，接着召开了向甘薯高产进军的誓师大会，通过擂台比武等形式，大大激励了干部群众的雄心大志，经过二十天突击，全县二十万亩甘薯地基本翻完，完全合乎规格要求。南通专区各县在竞赛运动中，全面革新棉花种植技术。过去一部分地区不耕就种的老习惯，这次都有了改变，进行了棉田冬翻。在冬翻的同时，对低产田进行了土壤改良。所有棉种都经过精选，达到了粒粒饱满的要求。
    江苏各地都本着“以粮为纲、全面跃进”“多种多收和高产多收相结合”的精神，在春节以前就层层规划春播作物种植面积，并根据不同地区的自然条件，合理调整了春播作物的布局。早在繁忙的冬季生产运动中，就动手准备春耕，到目前止，全省已有赣榆、盐城等十九个县市提前完成了水利冬季计划。全省改造低产土壤六百七十多万亩；平整土地五百四十多万亩；开垦荒地六十七万多亩；积肥量比去年同期猛增两倍多。
    新华社福州7日电　福建各地春耕播种由南到北提前展开。季节较早的九龙江和晋江流域，各公社社员在继续做好备耕工作的同时，已经浸种六百多万斤，播种二百多万斤，播种较早的秧田，已一片嫩绿。
    各地在春耕、播种中，都以公社和大队为单位，建立了春播育秧技术指导网、播种育秧专业队，并及早培养训练了大批播种育秧技术人员，加强技术指导，推广先进技术和良种。龙溪专区各县已播种的秧田，大都采用“三冬早”等良种，并广泛采用盐水选种、小苏打催芽和药剂消毒，使稻种发芽齐、出苗快、长得壮。长泰县采取建立育秧“标兵田”和现场观摩等各项办法，广泛推广早育秧、育壮秧等先进技术，使第一批近二千亩秧苗，普遍长得青葱茁壮。南靖县各公社及早训练了二千六百多名育秧技术人员，大面积培育壮秧，第一批已播下的十五万斤种子，全部都采用湿润秧田育秧。
    去冬以来，各地公社就掀起了以“水、肥、土”为中心的备耕热潮。目前，全省去冬今春因兴修水利而增加的灌溉、防洪、防涝工程受益面积已达二百九十多万亩，各地山区公社还改造了烂泥田、冷水田等低产山田七百六十多万亩。同时，各地公社还开展了以养猪积肥为中心的积肥运动，现在全省每亩春种作物已平均有肥料三百四十多担。全省春播田地除全部冬耕一遍外，75％的田实行深翻，其中49％并结合分层施肥和改良土壤。现在各地正力争各项备耕工作“满堂红”，迎接春耕大忙的到来。
    本报昆明7日电　云南省各族人民春耕生产的群众运动已经热烈展开。
    目前，在季节较早的澜沧江、红河、怒江、金沙江、瑞丽江的河谷里，已经栽下五万多亩双季早稻；为中稻准备的秧田，也已一片翠绿。居住在这里的各族人民正在给小秧灌溉、浇粪水，保证粒粒成苗、株株成秧、苗苗粗壮，以便适时插秧。在昆明、富民、寻甸等中心地区，秧田深翻的工作正搞得热火朝天，秧田一般深翻一尺以上；一队一队的马车、牛车正满载着优质肥料往秧田里送。云南西北部地区，也已开始做秧田。
    今年，云南省一千七百万亩水稻将进一步实行合理密植，平均每亩由去年的三万五千丛左右增加到四万五千丛左右，同时全省稻田的面积将比去年增加二百万亩。因此，全省秧田面积也将由去年的一百三十多万亩增加到二百二十多万亩。
    随着合理密植进一步地全面推广，要求水利灌溉量、肥料和籽种都相应地增加。去年全省水稻平均每亩施肥六千斤左右，今年要求增加到一万斤，并提高肥料的质量。现在全省已积肥二千多亿斤，其中人畜肥占56％以上，比去年同期增加20％，平均每亩大春作物已有肥料六千斤左右。去年全省保证灌溉的耕地是一千五百万亩，今年要求增加到两千万亩。目前水利已完成土石方一亿九千多万立方米，相当于去年同期完成数的183％；已完成大、中、小型工程七万多件。全省一千七百多万亩水稻种已基本留足，这些籽种都是去年秋收时经过穗选和补选留下来的。
    春耕农具的准备工作正在加紧进行。全省一千多个农具工厂、农业机械工厂根据云南土质坚硬、山区交通不便的情况，已经仿造、改良了一千多种农具，其中有深耕犁、畜力三行播种机、综合简易插秧机、水田犁等。这些农具的性能都很适合云南的条件。机引旋转耙一天可碎土五十亩以上，能代替一千五百多个劳动力。
