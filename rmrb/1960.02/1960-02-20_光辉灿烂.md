Radiantly Brilliant
    Pan Ziming

    Mommy, Mommy, set your mind at ease,
    The aunties treat me so very nicely;
    We sit on the waterwheel like an airplane,
    Flying to the sky to pick stars.

    This is a song sung by the children in the nursery of the Pengpu People's Commune in Shanghai, from the Haiyan Film Studio's documentary "Rising Sun." It sings of the children's happy and joyful life in the commune, and also of the tremendous changes in the countryside after communization. Look, a group of clever and lively children, led by their young aunties, are playing on a waterwheel pulled by an ox, the wheel powerfully turning. People can't help but ask: Is this a toy? No, this was originally an ox-drawn waterwheel. But in this commune, machines are now used for all irrigation, and there is no longer any need for this kind of ox-drawn waterwheel.

    The People's Commune has brought about epoch-making changes. Women's labor has been thoroughly liberated. With large numbers of people and strong forces, the commune can realize large-scale tool reforms and technological innovations, achieve the "Four Modernizations" in agriculture, and create superior conditions for building a more beautiful and happier socialist-communist life. Look, the Shanghai farmers organized in the People's Commune, using the collective wisdom and labor of their hands, are advancing by leaps and bounds in water conservancy construction, completing the grid-like network of rivers. Each commune has adopted electric irrigation equipment, with horsepower exceeding that of advanced cooperatives by more than ten times. The Changzheng People's Commune has equipped dozens of miles of artificial rainmaking devices in vegetable fields, splashing out the happy rain of socialism that does not thunder or lightning. The rain moistens the land and, even more so, moistens the hearts of the working people. From a drop of water, one can see the ocean; from water conservancy construction, one can see the enormous power of the People's Commune in turning rivers and seas upside down, diverting water for irrigation, and fighting against nature.

    From the film, we see the brand-new changes in the liberation of rural women's labor after the establishment of the People's Commune. The women's production army of the Shanghai Duxing People's Commune, named after Mu Guiying and Liu Hulan, accounts for two-thirds of the commune's labor force, with six thousand and several hundred members. They are full of energy, wielding iron shovels and hoes, deeply plowing the land one foot deep on more than 20,000 mu of cultivated land. Their hard-working sweat was not in vain, as they won a high yield of 150 jin of ginned cotton per mu. This is truly an unprecedented reform in thousands of years. In the children's songs, they sing of the mothers' love for the People's Commune. With the nurseries and canteens run by the commune, the broad masses of women have been completely freed from the heavy burden of having to take care of children and cook, and can wholeheartedly concentrate on production, working shoulder to shoulder with men to build the motherland and create great production achievements.

    The film "Rising Sun," with vivid and true facts, fully demonstrates the radiantly brilliant and infinitely splendid future of the People's Commune, one of the three magic weapons for building socialism, this sun rising on the horizon. After watching this film, the audience cannot help but cheer from the bottom of their hearts:

        "The People's Commune is good!"
        "Long live the People's Commune!"

    光辉灿烂
    潘子明
    妈妈妈妈放下心，
    阿姨待我亲又亲；
    水车当作飞机坐，
    飞到天空摘星星。
    这是海燕制片厂纪录片“旭日东升”中上海彭浦人民公社托儿所孩子们唱的一首歌曲。它唱出了公社里孩子们愉快幸福的生活，还唱出了公社化后农村的巨大变化。看，一群伶俐活泼的孩子，在年轻的阿姨带领下，坐在一架牛拉的水车盘上玩，车盘有力地旋转着。人们不禁要问：这是玩具吗？不，这原是一架牛拉水车。但是在这个公社里，已经全部用机器来灌溉，再用不着这种牛拉的水车了。
    人民公社带来划时代的巨大变化，妇女劳动力获得了彻底的解放，社大人多，兵强马壮，可以实现工具大改革、技术大革新，作到农业上的四化，为建设更美好更幸福的社会主义—共产主义生活，创造了优越的条件。你看，组织在人民公社里的上海的农民，用集体的智慧和劳动的双手向水利建设飞跃进军，完成了水利河网格子化，各公社都已采用了电机灌溉设备，马力超过高级社十几倍。长征人民公社在菜地上装备了几十里长的人工降雨器，飞溅出不打雷、不闪电的社会主义的幸福雨水。雨水滋润了土地，更滋润了劳动人民的心。从一滴水可以看到大海，从水利建设就能看到了人民公社翻江倒海、引水灌溉，同自然作斗争的巨大威力。
    从电影里，我们看到了人民公社成立以后，农村妇女劳动力获得解放的崭新变化。上海杜行人民公社以穆桂英、刘胡兰命名的妇女生产大军，她们占全社劳动力的三分之二，有六千几百名。她们干劲冲天，挥舞着铁锨、锄头，在二万多亩耕地上深翻土地一尺。她们辛勤劳动的汗珠没有白洒，夺得了每亩皮棉高产一百五十斤。这真是千百年来空前的改革。在孩子们的歌声中，唱出了妈妈热爱人民公社的心，广大妇女有了公社举办的托儿所、食堂，才从此彻底摆脱了既要管孩子、又要转锅台的繁重束缚，能舒胸宽怀、专心一意地大搞生产，和男子肩并肩地一同建设祖国，创造出巨大的生产成绩。
    影片“旭日东升”用生动、真实的事实，充分表现了建设社会主义的三大法宝之一的人民公社、这个地平线上初升的太阳的光辉灿烂和无限锦绣前程。观众看了这部影片，不得不由衷地欢呼：
        “人民公社好”
        “人民公社万岁”
