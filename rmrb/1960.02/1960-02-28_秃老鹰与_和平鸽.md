A fable:

    Bald Eagle and "Peace Dove"
    Qinghua University Art Troupe
    The bald eagle wanted to eat meat, flying here and there, from this place to that. People either glared at it or spat on it. "Damn bald eagle! Why don't you get lost!" it thought. "Perhaps the backyard will be more reliable." But it was greeted with brooms and banana peels! The situation was even worse in the open field, where even three feathers from its tail were knocked off!
    Seeing the situation was unfavorable, it suppressed its hatred, grinding its beak, and picking at its claws. Suddenly, an idea came to mind. It plunged into a lime pit, rolled around, and dyed its whole body white. Thus, people saw such a special "peace dove," its large beak open, emitting a hoarse voice. Afraid that people might suspect it, it hurriedly explained, "Everyone, don't misunderstand, I am a genuine peace dove. To spread the gospel of peace to you, I've even made my voice hoarse!"
    "Peace dove? How can it have a bayonet-like sharp beak, iron hook-like curved claws, and a bald head? What kind of peace dove is this?"
    "Oh... this... I... I am indeed a bit different. I am a peace dove with a long beak and curved claws. This long beak... this long beak can sing the newest and strangest songs of peace, and these curved claws can grab... please look at my white feathers, my wings, my tail, aren't they just like the real thing?"
    As it spoke, it hissed and sharpened its beak on a tree branch, picked at its claws, and sang in a strange voice, "I love peace, and I will use the sharpest beak in the world to sing the most enchanting lullaby. Kind people, go to sleep! In sweet sleep, you will unconsciously embark on the free world."
    But people did not sleep, staring at it, and tightening their fists even more. This made it sweat profusely, and the lime powder on its body became damp. With a gust of easterly wind, a large portion of it fell off, turning it into an ugly and ferocious monster that was neither black nor white!
    An eagle is an eagle after all. No matter how sinister and cunning it is, people will always expose it, strike it, and eliminate it. This is our task!

    秃老鹰与“和平鸽”
    清华大学文工团
    秃老鹰想吃肉，到处飞来飞去，从这里到那里，人们不是给它一个白眼，就是吐一口唾沫。“该死的秃老鹰！还不快滚开！”它想，还是到最可靠的后院去吧。可是欢迎它的却是扫帚把子和香蕉皮！在场子上的遭遇就更坏了，连尾巴上的毛也被打掉了三根！
    眼看大势不好，它憋着满肚子的仇恨，磨着嘴，剔着爪，忽然计上心来，就一头扎进石灰坑里，打了个滚儿，把浑身染的白白的。于是，人们就看到了这样一只特殊的“和平鸽”，它咧开大嘴，发出了嘶哑的嗓音。深怕人们对它怀疑，连忙解释说：“诸位，别误会，我是真正的和平鸽，为了给你们传播和平福音，我把嗓子都喊哑了！”
    “和平鸽？怎么长着刺刀般的尖嘴，铁钩似的弯爪，还秃着个脑袋，这算什么和平鸽？”
    “哦……这……我……我确实有点两样，我是一支长嘴，弯爪的和平鸽，这长嘴……这长嘴能唱出最新的最奇怪的和平之歌，这弯爪就能抓到……请看我这白白的羽毛，我的翅膀，我这尾巴，不和真的一样吗？”
    它一边说着，一边在树枝上嗤嗤地磨着嘴，剔着爪，又怪声怪气地唱了起来：“我热爱和平，我将用世界上最尖的嘴巴，唱出最迷人的催眠曲。善良的人们，你们睡吧！在甜睡里，你们会不知不觉地走上自由世界。”
    可是人们并没有睡，瞪着它，更紧的握起了拳头。这下子把它急的浑身直冒汗，身上的石灰粉都浸潮了，东风一吹，就掉了一大半，变成了一只不黑不白的又凶又丑的怪东西了！
    老鹰终究是老鹰，无论它多么阴险，狡猾，人们总是要揭穿它、打击它、消灭它，这就是我们的任务！
