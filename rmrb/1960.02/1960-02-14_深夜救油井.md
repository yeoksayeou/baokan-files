    Saving an Oil Well in the Dead of Night

    When oil field insulation worker Li Yanrong went to work, it was midnight. It was dark and windy, and Old Li was chilled to the bone. He finally squeezed into the warm boiler room and let out a sigh of relief.

    Li Yanrong faintly heard a "poof! poof! poof!" sound coming from outside. Based on his experience working in the oil field, he recognized this as a possible well blowout. Old Li quickly stepped out of the boiler room. After listening for a while, he realized the sound was coming from the high-yield oil well number 21. He immediately ran towards well number 21. Upon reaching the well site, sure enough, a stream of crude oil was violently spewing out. He rushed to the wellhead and carefully inspected it. It turned out the nozzle was blocked, and the crude oil could not smoothly pass through the nozzle into the oil collection pipe. If rescue wasn't immediate, the well could be ruined. However, Li Yanrong didn't have any tools. He immediately ran to the No. 9 oil gathering station, reported the situation to the oil workers, and then returned to the well site with the oil workers. Braving the "oil rain" and gas, they unscrewed the bolts, tightened the flanges, and repaired the wellhead. Only after the repair was completed did Li Yanrong realize that he was wet and cold all over. His clothes were soaked in black oil. When he heard the sound of crude oil spraying normally, he contentedly returned to the boiler room to go on duty.

    深夜救油井
    油田保温工人李言荣上班的时候，正是午夜十二点。天黑，风大，老李浑身上下都凉透了，好容易钻进温暖的锅炉房，才松过一口气来。
    李言荣隐约听到外面传来“卜！卜！卜！”的声音。他凭着油田工作的经验，听出这可能是井喷。老李急忙跨出锅炉房，他听了一会，发觉声音是从高产油井二十一号井传来的。他立即向二十一号井方向奔去。到了井场，果然，一股原油正在猛烈地喷射着。他抢到采油树近旁仔细一检查，原来是喷油嘴被堵塞了，原油不能顺利地通过喷油嘴进入集油管，不立刻抢救，这口井有可能报废。可是，李言荣没有带工具。他马上跑步到九号集油站，向采油工人报告了这个情况，又随即和采油工人一道返回井场，冒着“油雨”和瓦斯气卸螺丝，紧法兰盘，抢修采油树。直到抢修结束，李言荣才觉得自己浑身又湿又冷，原来他的衣服被黑油淋湿了。当他听到原油正常喷射的声音，才满意地回到锅炉房值班。
