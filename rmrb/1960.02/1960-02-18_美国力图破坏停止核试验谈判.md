    U.S. Attempts to Sabotage Nuclear Test Ban Negotiations
    Editor's Note: The U.S. "I.F. Stone's Weekly" published an article on February 15th, titled: "Pentagon and Atomic Energy Commission Seek Ways to Sabotage Nuclear Negotiations, But They Hope to Pin the Blame on the Russians While Doing So." The "New York Post" published an editorial on February 12th, titled "A Dark Victory." Both articles reveal that the U.S. is attempting to sabotage the nuclear test ban negotiations in order to resume nuclear testing and intensify the arms race. Extracts of these two articles are translated below:

    "I.F. Stone's Weekly" said: U.S. wants to dash hopes of disarmament agreement
    The obvious truth about the nuclear test ban negotiations is that powerful forces within the U.S. government want to terminate this negotiation forever, thereby dashing hopes of reaching a disarmament agreement as well. They are seeking a plan that will undermine the negotiations but blame it on the Russians. They are currently trying to formulate a proposal that they believe the Russians will definitely reject—that is, a plan that allows continued underground testing while still requiring a great degree of inspection. The military and the Atomic Energy Commission hope to invent more "small" weapons. The further we go along this path, the smaller the hope will be of fighting a non-nuclear war.

    "New York Post" said: Pentagon hopes to develop new atomic weapons
    President Eisenhower's proposal to "partially" ban nuclear tests is a victory for the gamblers in the Pentagon and the Atomic Energy Commission.

    The main argument of the Pentagon and the Atomic Energy Commission against ending "small-scale underground tests" is that such tests cannot be reliably detected, and therefore, if we agree to stop such tests, the Soviets might secretly overtake us. This is a cunning excuse by the pro-testing group. The unavoidable evidence is that the Pentagon wants to continue developing new atomic weapons, the Atomic Energy Commission is eager to help, and powerful forces in both agencies oppose any genuine effort to achieve a nuclear "ceasefire." Ike's request to draft a unified international plan to perfect methods of detecting underground explosions in order to eventually monitor and ban these explosions also reflects the true aim of those who are constantly seeking new obstacles to obstruct agreement.

    The President admits that all tests should eventually be terminated, so why does he insist on allowing the Soviets to gain the propaganda advantage that accompanies their advocacy of a comprehensive test ban? The dangers involved in resuming these horrific competitions are greater than the risks we take to end this competition. The President said that the issue of resuming tests is not yet settled and remains to be resolved with our allies. But the real problem is not with our allies. It is a problem within the Eisenhower administration.

### 美国力图破坏停止核试验谈判

专栏：外论摘要

    美国力图破坏停止核试验谈判
    编者按：美国“斯通周刊”2月15日发表了一篇文章，题目是：“五角大楼和原子能委员会寻求破坏核谈判的方案，但是它们希望在这样做的同时把罪责推到俄国人身上”。“纽约邮报”2月12日发表了一篇社论，题目是“黑暗的胜利”。这两篇文章，都透露了美国正力图破坏停止核试验的谈判，以便恢复核试验和加紧核军备竞赛。现将这两篇文章摘译如下：
    “斯通周刊”说：美国要使裁军协议的希望破灭
    关于核试验谈判的很明显的真相是：美国政府中的强有力的势力想要永远终止这个谈判，从而使达成裁军协议的希望也永远破灭。他们正在寻求一个方案，这一方案，将破坏谈判，但是又可以把罪责推到俄国人身上。他们目前正在尝试制订的是一项他们认为俄国人肯定会拒绝的建议——那就是一项允许继续进行地下试验而且仍然要求很大程度的视察的计划。军方和原子能委员会希望发明更多的“小型”武器。我们沿着这个方针走得越远，打起仗来会是非核战争的希望也就越小。
    “纽约邮报”说：五角大楼希望发展新原子武器
    艾森豪威尔总统的“有限地”禁止核试验的建议是五角大楼和原子能委员会里赌徒们的胜利。
    五角大楼和原子能委员会反对终止“小规模地下试验”的主要论点是，对这种试验不能够有把握地侦察出来，因此，如果我们同意停止这种试验，那末苏联人就可能暗地里赶过我们。这是主张试验的集团的一个狡猾的借口。无法逃避的证据是，五角大楼希望继续发展新的原子武器，原子能委员会热切地希望给以帮助，而这两个机构中的强大的势力都反对为取得核“停火”的任何真正的努力。艾克要求拟订一项一致的国际计划，使得侦察地下爆炸的方法趋于完善，以便最后也能监督和禁止这些爆炸。这反映了那些不断寻求阻挠协议的新障碍的人的真正目标。
    总统承认，一切试验最后都应当终止，那么，为什么他又坚持让苏联人得到由于他们主张全面禁止核试验而陪随的宣传优势呢？在恢复这些恐怖的竞赛时所包含的危险，比我们为了终止这个竞赛而冒的危险更大。总统说，恢复试验的问题现在还没有定论，有待同我们的盟国一起解决。但是真正的问题并非同我们盟国的问题。这是艾森豪威尔政府内部的问题。
