    The Sugar of Suffering and the Unyielding Machete
    Kong Mai, Bing An
    In Cuba, it is the vigorous spring season, and the Cuban people are welcoming their first abundant harvest of sugarcane and sugar since the land reform. Under the vast expanse of clear sky, in the boundless green sea of sugarcane fields, thousands upon thousands of sugarcane workers are wielding their machetes, row after row of stout sugarcane falling behind them. Carts and trucks, enclosed by wooden fences and laden with sugarcane, are moving in an endless stream across the fields, heading towards the sugar mills. It was on such a day of harvest that we visited the "Duredo" sugar mill in the southeast suburbs of Havana.
        From Bitter to Sweet
    "Cuban sugar is the sweetest in the world, but in the past, sugar was bitter for the Cuban people. Only now is it truly beginning to taste sweet." Next to the deafening roar of the cane crushing machine, the sugar mill technician, Martinz, spoke these meaningful words while handing us a branch of tender, sweet sugarcane, inviting us to taste it. He said that this kind of sugarcane, called "Crescent" sugarcane in Cuba, is the best in Cuba. It is thick, juicy, and one hundred pounds of sugarcane can be refined into twelve pounds of sugar.
    The Duredo sugar mill has over one thousand sugar-making and sugarcane field workers. It belongs to Cuban capital, and the owner is called Asbro. Last year, this mill produced 500,000 bags (250 pounds per bag) of sugar. At the end of the year, there was an inventory of 20,000 bags. This year, it will produce approximately the same amount of sugar.
    Spring is the harvest season in Cuba, and the "sugar season," lasting about three months, begins from the start of cane cutting and sugar refining in January. The sugarcane fields of this mill were opened in mid-January. Responding to the government's call to ensure this year's sugar production, the workers, with great enthusiasm, completed the repair work of the factory buildings three days ahead of schedule. Three days ago, the machines started turning, the chimneys started smoking, and the first batch of sugarcane began to enter the cane crushing machine. Whether it's the Duredo sugar mill or sugar mills across the country, the harvesting and sugar refining situation this year is better than in previous years. This year, all of Cuba will produce 5.5 million tons of sugar, and if needed, it has the capacity to increase it by another 1.5 million tons.
    The technician accompanying us on the factory tour possesses the characteristic enthusiasm and hospitality of the Cuban people. He tirelessly explained the sugar production situation and took us to see the fascinating sugar production process. The sugarcane is crushed into juice in the cane crushing machine. The bagasse is used as fuel to power the machines. The sugarcane juice flows into the filter to remove impurities, then heated in the heater to precipitate the impurities, becoming pure liquid juice, which flows into the evaporation pan. The evaporation pans are cylindrical, like rows of silver-white oil storage towers. Through a piece of glass inlaid on the pan, we saw the reddish-brown syrup tumbling in the pan, gradually condensing into sugar granules. The workers insert a hollow copper tube into the pan to take out the syrup and test its concentration. The syrup then undergoes condensation and cooling, initially taking the shape of sugar. However, at this time, the sugar granules are still sticky. They must be separated by a separator to become raw sugar. The raw sugar particles are coarse and slightly reddish. The raw sugar then goes through filtration and drying, becoming clean, white sugar. In this mill, the sugar condensation process takes four hours. The entire process from sugarcane crushing to bagging takes twelve hours.
      Pride and Hope
    Sugar is Cuba's pride and hope. Cuba is called the "sugar bowl of the world" or the "sweetest country in the world." The sugar produced in Cuba each year, packed into bags (250 pounds per bag), can be arranged in a line that circles the Earth along the equator. There are seventy-eight countries producing sugar worldwide. But Cuba's sugar production accounts for 16%. Sugar can be seen everywhere in Cuba. A glass sugar bowl filled with white sugar is indispensable on the counter of every bar and on the dining table of every family. The per capita consumption of sugar by Cubans is the highest in the world. Cuba, with a population of six million, uses 330,000 tons of sugar each year.
    Sugarcane is a symbol of Cuba's wealth, good fortune, and struggle. Private restaurants hang it at the entrance. During Christmas, people use it as a Christmas tree to replace pines and cypresses. In every parade, sugarcane field workers hold bundles of sugarcane as they walk past the reviewing stand. Countless times, workers have waged struggles against exploiters in the sugarcane fields.
    Cubans say that sugarcane is the "national treasure." Indeed, sugarcane can be made into various delicious candies and pastries. Sugarcane juice can be used to brew sweet wine. Syrup can be used as a raw material for synthetic rubber and other chemical products. Sugarcane bagasse can be used as fuel, feed, rayon, plastics, artificial wood, and paper. In the Cuban fields, the main plants you can see are towering palm trees and lush green sugarcane. The total area of all sugarcane fields in Cuba is as large as the entire province of Matanzas. The entire island of Cuba is like a giant sugarcane plantation.
    However, sugarcane did not originate in Cuba. Sugarcane comes from Asia, from India. Arab sailors discovered a sweet and juicy plant on the banks of the Ganges River in India. They carried the seedlings of this plant on sailing ships, across the ocean, and transplanted them to the hot lands of Egypt and Ethiopia. Thus, sugarcane spread from Asia to Africa. The Portuguese transplanted sugarcane to Madeira Island in the Atlantic Ocean near Africa in 1420. The Arabs were the first to discover the method of condensing sugarcane juice into sugar. The Portuguese improved the sugar-making technology. The Spanish saw the great benefits of growing sugarcane. At the end of the fifteenth century, they transplanted it to the hot and rainy coastal areas of southeastern Spain. Later, Spanish colonists transplanted sugarcane to Haiti and the Dominican Republic, then known as the Spanish Island. The Spanish colonial conqueror Velasquez and his subordinates, carrying sugarcane seedlings, crossed the Windward Passage by boat and came to Cuba, across from Haiti. They planted the first sugarcane seedling in the fertile soil of Baracoa, at the eastern end of Cuba. From then on, sugarcane brought the sweetest sugar to the Cuban people, but also brought them endless poverty and suffering!
    Cuba has ideal natural conditions for growing sugarcane. This crop needs a hot climate, fertile soil, and high humidity. The average monthly temperature in Cuba is twenty-one to twenty-eight degrees, and the highest temperature reaches thirty-eight degrees. There is sufficient rainfall, so artificial irrigation is not necessary. The average annual rainfall is between 1,300 and 1,400 millimeters. The soil in Cuba is so fertile that you can squeeze oil out of it with one foot. Generally, sugarcane fields are planted once and harvested for ten years. Soon after harvesting, new seedlings sprout from the roots. The next year, sugarcane becomes a forest again. Some sugarcane fields were planted forty years ago, or even decades ago, without replanting, fertilizing, or irrigating, and they yield abundant harvests every year. One-third of Cuba's land is plains, which facilitates the planting and transportation of sugarcane. The island nation is full of good harbors. Ocean-going ships can conveniently transport sugar to all parts of the world. Cuba is truly a uniquely blessed "land of abundance" for developing the sugar industry.
        The Beginning of Suffering
    As early as the end of the sixteenth century, the Spanish built the first five sugar mills near the Mendalelles River near Havana. The rushing river water drove the primitive cane crushing machines. Soon after, they discovered that more manpower was needed to handle such heavy work. In 1595, the King of Spain exchanged the then-famous "Havana tobacco" from English slave traders for talking machines—African black slaves! Later, Chinese slaves—Chinese laborers—became the backup for black slaves. More than 50,000 Chinese people left their homes and sold themselves to Cuba. More than 7,600 Chinese people died during the long and painful journey. Spanish colonists used whips, chains, and rifles to force Cubans, black slaves, and Chinese laborers to do heavy work for fourteen hours a day. A new sugar industry was established in the sound of whips and in the sweat and blood of slaves.
    After the mid-eighteenth century, due to the black slave uprisings and the decline of the sugar industry in Haiti (which accounted for 75% of the world's sugar production at the time), and due to the application of steam engines in the sugar industry and the creation of methods for using bagasse as fuel, the Cuban sugar industry developed. Many small sugar workshops were merged. A few sugar mills began to monopolize the sugar industry.
    As early as the beginning of the nineteenth century, the nouveau riche in northern Cuba—the emerging American imperialism—coveted this "pearl of the Caribbean" and always wanted to annex Cuba. In 1807, US President Jefferson stated that seizing Cuba was the sacred right of the United States. In 1823, the United States announced the notorious "Monroe Doctrine." The "Monroe Doctrine" declared that "America is for Americans." In 1890, when Cuba was still a Spanish colony, the United States controlled the export of Cuban sugar and freely stipulated the price of Cuban sugar. Many of the 400 sugar mills at that time already belonged to American capital. By 1897, the amount of American investment in Cuba had reached 70 million US dollars.
    Cuba has sweet sugar, but also an unyielding people. They have never stopped fighting for independence and land. In the 1860s, the black slaves in the sugarcane fields and sugar mills rose up and launched the first large-scale black uprising in insufferable conditions. The flames of a national uprising burned in the fields and valleys of Cuba for ten years, from 1868 to 1878. In 1895, Cuba broke out in the second war of independence led by the national hero José Martí, the black general Moncada, and the mixed-race man Maceo. The sugar workers, wearing wide-brimmed straw hats and holding machetes for harvesting sugarcane, were the first to rise up and fight. Patriots burned sugarcane fields and sugar mills everywhere. They used the cost of bloodshed to reclaim land and independence.
        New Chains
    Seeing that the shackles of Spanish colonialism were about to be shattered, on the eve of the Cuban people's winning land and independence, the United States took advantage of the Cuban people's struggle for liberation, declared war on Spain in April 1898, and launched the Spanish-American War. The American ambassador to Spain said to the Madrid government at the time: "Just like wheat and cotton in India and Egypt are of vital importance to the British Empire, Cuban sugar is of vital importance to us." From then on, the United States reaped the fruits of the Cuban people's struggle in exchange for blood, occupied Cuba, turned it into a "protectorate" of the United States, and left the Cuban people with heinous plunder and heavier chains. However, the Cuban people preserved the machetes and wide-brimmed straw hats used in the war of independence as symbols of the struggle for land, independence, and liberation, expressing their unyielding determination not to stop fighting.
    The United States used bayonets and cannons to pave the way for its economic enslavement in Cuba. The American army occupied Cuba for several years, burning, killing, and looting on Cuban territory. The military government promulgated Military Order No. 62, giving American colonists all privileges to seize land, thus forming the largest new landowners in Cuba. They began generations of plunder and exploitation, sucking the marrow of this fertile land endlessly like an octopus. Sugarcane fields accounted for 40% of the total cultivated land in Cuba. Twenty-six American sugar companies occupied 72,000 caballeries of land, that is, 75% of the best sugarcane fields. Among the 161 sugar mills in Cuba, the largest 36 belonged to Americans. American capital also invested in many of the remaining sugar mills. 54% of the sugar mill production capacity was controlled by American monopoly capital. From 1900 to 1958, Cuba produced a total of 16.3 billion US dollars worth of sugar. This money accounted for about 30% of the total value of industrial and agricultural production in Cuba for more than 50 years. However, American capitalists took away half of it! The profits were not used for expanded reproduction in Cuba. According to the openly published and obviously reduced figures of American companies, in the past 50 years or so, 2 billion US dollars of sugar industry profits flowed out of Cuba and into the pockets of Wall Street tycoons.
    The single economy of Cuba, formed by the United States for the purpose of plunder, made Cuba a mere base for supplying raw sugar to the United States. Only six pounds out of every hundred pounds of sugar produced in Cuba were consumed domestically, and 75 pounds were shipped to the United States. The Cuban economy was almost entirely dependent on foreign exports. Sugar accounted for 80% of foreign exports. In this way, the United States also controlled the economic lifeline of Cuba through the sugar trade.
    American capitalists also made huge profits in the sugar trade by buying cheap and selling dear. American merchants purchased sugar at a price of 5.2 US cents per pound and sold it on the American market at a price of 11.5 US cents. 60% of the sugar sold by Cuba to the United States was raw sugar. American sugar giants refined the raw sugar into white sugar and made another profit of two US cents per pound. Cuban white sugar was made into cube sugar in the United States and sold back to the Cuban market at a price increase of three US cents per pound. American merchants made a fortune by exporting more than 100,000 tons of sugar candies and canned goods made from Cuban sugar to Cuba every year at high prices.
    From Dark Night to Dawn
    The single economy and American control over the Cuban market, like a pair of shackles, bound the development of the Cuban economy. In addition to the sugar industry, Cuba had almost no other industry. Taking the sugar industry as an example, sugarcane and syrup could have produced many by-products, but the only by-product of sugarcane in Cuba was sweet wine. Agriculture was even in a state of regression and bankruptcy. In the countryside, large tracts of land were enclosed by barbed wire, symbolizing the evil large plantation system. Sometimes, we drove for dozens of miles without seeing the end of the barbed wire. The land was barren, and the people were hungry. Cubans had to buy 75% of their necessities of life, food, clothing, and shelter from the United States at high prices. Cuba had to import everything that could have been produced on its own land from the United States: rice, potatoes, beans, onions, cabbage, fruits... etc. For example, in 1957, the United States bought 466.6 million US dollars of sugar from Cuba, while Cuba imported 577.7 million US dollars of goods from the United States. From 1948 to 1958, Cuba lost 1 billion US dollars in unequal trade with the United States. The Cuban people used all the little foreign exchange earned from years of hard work from all over the world to subsidize it, but it was still not enough.
    People can't help but ask: What benefits did Cuba's huge wealth—sugar, Cuba's national treasure sugarcane—bring to the Cuban people? What benefits did Cuban workers and farmers get in exchange for generations of hard work and sweat? The answer is: hunger and death. The sugarcane harvesting and sugar-making season in Cuba is only three months long. Only during this period do sugar workers have jobs. A family of six can only get 45 pesos a month. During the remaining nine months of the slack season, 700,000 people in Cuba are unemployed. People are displaced everywhere, and families are broken. Cubans bitterly call this annual period the "dead season" because it brings them death.
    In the long dark years, how many evenings, sugarcane field workers gathered in small huts made of palm leaves, accompanied by the heavy beat of the "guitar," softly humming Guillen's verses, expressing their anger and accusation against the American plunderers:
             Negro
           Standing beside the sugarcane field.
             American
           Standing above the sugarcane field.
             Land
           Stretching underneath the sugarcane field.
             Blood
           Flowing out from our bodies!
  The Cuban people, with their glorious anti-colonialist tradition, had already blown conch shells in the sugarcane fields of Oriente Province and Las Villas Province in the 1930s, gathered together, picked up rifles and machetes, and rushed to the plantations of American landlords. Sugar workers held general strikes across the country. The Cuban people's struggle, like the huge waves of the Caribbean Sea, rose and fell, surging forward.
    The sparks sown by the Cuban people's century-old struggle burned fiercely in the Sierra Maestra mountains. Workers, peasants, and patriots all joined the ranks of the insurgents. On the morning of January 1, 1959, dawn drove away the darkness, and a dynasty raised by Washington collapsed. To fight for land and independence, the Cuban people paid the lives of 20,000 of their outstanding sons and daughters. The insurgent soldiers preserved the beards and long hair they had grown during the war as a sign of the spirit of arduous struggle. They said that they would not shave or cut their hair until the land reform was realized.
    In the past year, Cuban farmers have begun to acquire land. They have organized more than 500 cooperatives. Sugar workers have ensured the production of 5.5 million tons of sugar. Nine sugar mills are already under the management and operation of the Land Reform Committee. The Cuban people have held two earth-shattering million-person demonstrations to defend land reform and oppose American interference. They celebrated the victorious end of a fighting year with great victories. In the new year, the Cuban people will further sever the sucking tubes of the American octopus and achieve economic independence. The Cuban revolution is constantly advancing and is becoming more and more the banner and torch of the people's struggle in Latin America.
    Interference and Counter-Interference
    In order to maintain its enslavement and plunder of Cuba and fearing the impact of the Cuban revolution on the entire Latin American national democratic revolution movement, the United States has launched an offensive against Cuba in all aspects: military, economic, diplomatic, and propaganda.
    Eisenhower had one weapon in his hand—economic threats. He wielded the big stick, threatening to cut Cuba's share in the American market and lower sugar prices. Washington lawmakers introduced bills in Congress calling for the revision of the US-Cuba Sugar Agreement, even threatening to cut Cuba's sugar quota to 500,000 tons and import it at world sugar prices (that is, three US cents per pound). The current US-Cuba Sugar Agreement was signed in 1956 and expires on December 31 of this year. The agreement stipulates that Cuba supplies the United States with 3,119,655 tons of sugar at a listed price of 5.2 US cents per pound. The Americans call this a "preference" for Cuba. In fact, the United States does this entirely to protect the interests of its own sugar giants. Because Cuba receives this "preference," Cuban sugar cannot compete and trade freely in the world and American markets. In this way, American sugar tycoons can sell sugar to the American people at a high price of more than 11 US cents per pound. The wool always comes from the sheep. At the same time, the United States has used this superficial "concession" to obtain genuine preferences for Cuban imports since 1903. For example, Cuba has to pay a tariff of 3.70 US dollars per quintal for importing rice, but American merchants only pay 1.85 US dollars. American merchants, with extremely low tariffs, squeeze out Cuban and other countries' commodities and flood the Cuban market with American commodities. In this way, Cuba loses more than 100 million US dollars in unequal trade with the United States every year.
    Eisenhower recently asked the US Congress to grant him special powers to reduce Cuba's sugar quota and sugar prices at any time. In this way, sugar has become a tool for the United States to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs.
      Flames of Anger
    Since the beginning of this year, American interference in Cuba has become even more rampant. Almost every day, American planes come to burn Cuban sugarcane fields. Every night, American-made planes take off from an airport in the southern United States, turn off the lights on their fuselages, and sneak into the northern coast of Cuba. In Santa Clara in Las Villas Province, Alegria in Camagüey Province, Baire in Oriente Province, and even large tracts of promising sugarcane fields in the suburbs of Havana, American-made incendiary bombs manufactured by the "BRISTOL MARINE" arsenal in October 1959 were dropped. Thousands of sugarcane field workers and soldiers bravely put out the flames. They gripped their rifles and machetes tightly, gazing north with angry eyes, while the charred sugarcane beside them was still smoking. They had put in a whole year of hard work and sweat for every sugarcane. When the insurgents were still fighting in the mountains to regain land and independence, 500-pound American-made heavy incendiary bombs had ruthlessly burned Cuba's peaceful countryside. Today, when the Cuban people are joyfully welcoming the first sugarcane harvest after the land reform, American-made incendiary bombs have once again ruthlessly burned the promising fields. The bombs have burned Cuban sugarcane fields red, but they have also ignited the flames of anger throughout the island nation. Sugarcane field workers have decided to increase working hours and rush to harvest sugarcane at night. Workers in sugar mills are determined to extract white sugar from the 19.3 million arrovases (one arrovase is about 11 kilograms) of burned sugarcane. Railway workers and university students have also extended a hand of friendship. They have decided to volunteer in the countryside to rush to harvest sugarcane. Cubans say that we no longer believe American lies. While Eisenhower is talking about friendship, he is letting planes burn our crops. The "Combat Newspaper" calls American-made incendiary bombs the "gift" of "friendship" that Eisenhower gave to the Cuban people. The army is answering American provocations by strengthening combat readiness, and the people are answering by stepping up the organization of militias and raising vigilance. On the sugarcane fields that stretch as far as the eye can see, there are watchtowers. Next to them are fire trucks, ready to be dispatched at any time. Sugarcane field workers ride horses through the green sea of sugarcane, vigilantly monitoring the sabotage of American-made planes and counter-revolutionaries. Every morning and evening, on every street and alley in Havana, you can see rows of militias practicing, their shouts of "One, two, three, four" echoing in the sky.
    Since the Cuban people are not afraid of American planes and cannons, they will certainly not be intimidated by the "economic big stick." Cuban Prime Minister Castro said in a speech: "The best weapons for our small country to defend itself and develop its economy are national dignity and sovereignty. The Cuban people have become masters of their own destiny for the first time. The people have the ability to consolidate the victory of the revolution." He said: "The past sixty years were sixty years of American plunder of Cuba. At that time, Cuba's hands were tied. Today, we are free. The land will be ours. We will not reduce sugar production, but we will increase it. Because we can trade freely with countries all over the world."
    More importantly, Cuba is developing its own national industry and diversified economy. In this regard, Cuba has excellent natural conditions and abundant underground resources. The Cuban government has formulated a twelve-point economic development plan. It will reduce the sugarcane planting area by increasing the yield per unit area and increase the total output. Cuba will soon be able to supply all imported agricultural products and strive to export them. For example, Cuba imports 4.2 million quintals of rice worth 40 million US dollars from the United States every year. Cuba can avoid importing from the United States by planting 7,000 caballeries of rice. And Cuba plans to plant more than 6,000 caballeries of rice this year. Cuba will also develop heavy industries such as steel and oil. Textiles will be completely self-sufficient within five years. In this way, Cuba will be able to get rid of its dependence on and exploitation by the United States for imports and exports, and further develop the national economy with the money saved.
    On January 29, National Bank Governor Guevara announced that Cuba will respond to every American measure that harms Cuban interests with countermeasures; Cuba will fight back against every new American threat with new decrees. Commerce Minister Sepero Bonilla also announced that if the United States reduces Cuba's sugar quota and lowers sugar prices, Cuba will also equally reduce the import of American goods.
    These are the Cuban people's determination, and also the determination of the workers at the Duredo sugar mill. As we walked out of the factory building, worker Lopez said to us excitedly: "We are a small country, but our spirit is not small. Our enemy is a strong country, but it can no longer rule us."
    Yes, people who have awakened and stood up cannot be subdued by any force. If the American imperialists really dare to carry out armed intervention in Cuba, they will definitely fall before the machetes raised high by the Cuban people, just like the sugarcane in the harvest season.

### 苦难的糖和不屈的砍刀

    苦难的糖和不屈的砍刀
    孔迈  炳庵
    在古巴，正是朝气蓬勃的春天，古巴人民在迎接土地改革后第一次甘蔗和糖的丰收。在万里晴空之下，一望无际的青纱帐里，千千万万的蔗田工人挥动着砍刀，一排排粗壮的甘蔗倒在他们身后。用木栅围着的满载甘蔗的卡车和牛车在原野上鱼贯而行，开往制糖厂。就在这样一个收获的日子里，我们访问了哈瓦那东南郊的杜莱多糖厂。
        从苦到甜
      “古巴的糖是世界上最甜的，然而在过去，糖对古巴人说来是苦的。只有在现在才真正开始有甜味。”在隆隆轰响的榨蔗机旁，糖厂技师马尔丁斯一面说着这句意味深长的话，一面递给我们一枝嫩甜的甘蔗，请我们尝尝。他说，这种甘蔗在古巴叫“月牙”蔗，是古巴最好的甘蔗。它粗壮多汁，每一百磅甘蔗能炼十二磅糖。
    杜莱多糖厂制糖和蔗田工人共有一千多人。属于古巴资本，厂主叫阿斯布罗。这个厂去年生产了五十万包（每包二百五十磅）糖。年终库存了两万包。今年大约生产同样数量的糖。
    春天是古巴收获的季节，从1月开始割蔗榨糖起，就进入了为期三个月左右的“糖季”。这个厂的蔗田是在1月中旬开镰的。工人们响应政府保证今年糖生产的号召，用极大的热情，提前三天作好了厂房的修理工作。三天前，机器转动，烟囱冒烟，第一批甘蔗开始进入榨蔗机。不论杜莱多糖厂，或者全国各地的糖厂，今年的收割和榨糖情况比往年都好。今年全古巴将生产五百五十万吨糖，如果需要，有能力再增加一百五十万吨。
    陪我们参观厂房的技师，有着古巴人特有的热情和好客。他不停地讲解糖生产的情况，并带着我们参观非常有趣的糖的生产过程。甘蔗在榨蔗机里榨成汁。蔗渣被利用为发动机器的燃料。甘蔗汁流入过滤机清除杂物，再经过加热机加热，使杂物沉淀，成为纯洁的液汁，流入蒸发锅。蒸发锅是圆桶型的，像一座座银白色的贮油塔似的。透过一块镶在锅上的玻璃，我们看见土红色的糖浆在锅里翻腾，逐渐凝成糖粒。工人把一根空心的铜管伸入锅内，取出糖浆检验浓度。糖浆再经过凝结和冷却的过程，就初具了糖的形状。但是这时的糖粒还是粘连在一起的。还必须用分离机分离，变成原糖。原糖颗粒粗大，微带赤色。原糖再经过过滤和烘干过程，就成了洁白的白糖。在这个厂里糖凝结过程需四个小时。从甘蔗榨汁到装包的整个过程则需十二个钟头。
      骄傲和希望
    糖是古巴的骄傲和希望，古巴被称为“世界的糖罐”或“世界上最甜的国家”。古巴每年生产的糖装成包（每包二百五十磅），排列成行，可以顺着赤道绕地球一圈。全世界有七十八个国家生产糖。但古巴生产的糖就占了16％。在古巴到处都可以看到糖。每个酒吧间的柜台上，每个家庭的饭桌上，一个盛满白糖的玻璃糖罐是必不可少的。古巴人对糖的个人消费量是世界上最高的。六百万人口的古巴每年要用去三十三万吨糖。
    甘蔗是古巴的财富、吉祥和战斗的标志。民间的酒家把它挂在店门口。圣诞节时人们把它当作圣诞树来代替松柏。每次游行，蔗田工人们捧着一束束甘蔗，走过检阅台。多少次，工人们曾在甘蔗园里进行反对剥削者的斗争。
    古巴人说，甘蔗是“国宝”。的确，蔗糖可以做成各种可口的糖果和糕点。甘蔗汁可以酿甜酒。糖浆可做合成胶等化学品的原料。甘蔗渣可作燃料、饲料、人造纤维、塑料、人造木和纸张等。在古巴田野里，你能看到的主要植物就是参天的棕榈和葱绿的甘蔗。古巴所有的甘蔗田面积加起来就有马坦萨斯一个省大。整个古巴岛就像一个巨大的甘蔗园。
    然而，甘蔗的老家并不是古巴。甘蔗来自亚洲，来自印度。阿拉伯水手在印度的恒河畔发现了一种甘甜多汁的植物。他们把这种植物的苗带上帆船，漂过重洋，移植到埃及和埃塞俄比亚的炽热的土地上。于是甘蔗就从亚洲传到了非洲。葡萄牙人又在1420年把甘蔗移植到非洲附近大西洋中的马得拉岛上。阿拉伯人首先发现了使甘蔗汁凝结成糖的方法。葡萄牙人改进了制糖技术。西班牙人看到了种植甘蔗的巨大利益。在十五世纪末，把它移植到西班牙东南炎热多雨的沿海地区。后来，西班牙殖民者又把甘蔗移植到当时称为西班牙岛的海地和多米尼加。西班牙殖民征服者维拉斯格斯和他的手下人，带着甘蔗苗，乘船渡过温德华海峡，来到海地对岸的古巴。他们把第一棵甘蔗苗播种在古巴东端巴拉哥阿的富饶的泥土里。从此，甘蔗带给了古巴人民最甜的糖，也带给了古巴人民无穷的贫困和痛苦！
    古巴有着理想的种植甘蔗的自然条件。这种作物需要炎热的气候，肥沃的土壤和高度的潮湿。古巴平均月温度是二十一到二十八度，最高气温达三十八度。雨量充足，不必人工灌溉。全年平均雨量都在一千三百至一千四百公厘之间。古巴土地肥沃得一脚可以踩出油来似的。一般蔗田播种一次，丰收十年。收割不久，新苗又在根上钻出来了。第二年，又是甘蔗成林。有些蔗田是四十年、甚至几十年前播种的，从不重播、施肥和灌溉，年年丰收。古巴全国三分之一土地是平原，便利甘蔗的种植和运输。岛国处处是良港。海轮可以方便地把糖载运到世界各地。古巴真是一个得天独厚的发展糖业的“天府之国”。
        苦难的开始
    远在十六世纪末，西班牙人就在哈瓦那附近的门达累斯河畔盖起了第一批五家制糖工厂。湍激的河水推动了原始的榨蔗机。不久后，他们发现，要担负这样重的活，需要更多的人力。1595年，西班牙国王用当时就已负有盛名的“哈瓦那烟草”，从英国人口贩子手里换来了会说话的机器——非洲的黑奴！后来中国的奴隶——华工成了黑奴的后备。曾经有五万多个中国人背井离乡，卖身到古巴。其中七千六百多个中国人死在漫长痛苦的旅途中。西班牙殖民者用鞭子、铁链、来福枪驱使着古巴人、黑奴和华工做着一天十四小时的重活。一个新兴的制糖工业在皮鞭声中，在奴隶们的血汗中建立起来了。
    十八世纪中叶以后，由于黑奴起义和海地制糖工业的衰退（当时海地的糖产量占世界产量的75％），由于蒸气机在制糖工业中的运用和利用蔗渣当燃料的方法的创造，古巴糖工业得到了发展。许多小的制糖工场被并吞。少数糖厂开始垄断制糖工业。
    早在十九世纪初叶，古巴北方的爆发户——新兴的美帝国主义就垂涎这颗“加勒比海的明珠”，一直想并吞古巴。1807年，美国总统杰弗逊就表示，侵占古巴是美国神圣的权利。1823年，美国宣布了臭名远扬的“门罗主义”。“门罗主义”宣告“美洲是美国人的美洲”。1890年，远在古巴还是西班牙的殖民地的时候，美国就控制了古巴糖的出口，并随心所欲地规定古巴糖的价格。当时的四百家糖厂中，有许多家已属于美国资本。到1897年，美国在古巴的投资额已达七千万美元。
    古巴有甜蜜的糖，也有不屈的人民。他们从来没有停止过争取独立和土地的斗争。十九世纪六十年代，甘蔗园和榨糖厂里的黑奴们揭竿而起，忍无可忍地发动了第一次声势浩大的黑人起义。一次全民起义的火焰从1868年到1878年在古巴的田野和山谷里燃烧了十年之久。1895年，古巴爆发了由民族英雄何塞·马蒂，黑人将军蒙卡多和黑白混血种人马西奥领导的第二次独立战争。糖业工人头戴宽边草帽，手举收割甘蔗的砍刀，首先起来战斗。爱国者到处焚烧蔗田和糖厂。他们就用不惜流血的代价来夺回土地和独立。
        新的锁链
    眼看西班牙殖民主义的枷锁快要粉碎了，就在古巴人民将要争得土地和独立的前夕，美国利用了古巴人民争取解放的斗争，在1898年4月对西班牙宣战，发动了美西战争。美国驻西班牙大使当时对马德里政府说：“就像印度和埃及的小麦和棉花对于大英帝国一样，古巴的糖对我们有着性命攸关的意义。”从此，美国坐收了古巴人民用鲜血换来的斗争果实，占领了古巴，把它变成美国的“保护国”，而留给古巴人民的是穷凶极恶的掠夺和更加沉重的锁链。但是古巴人民把独立战争中使用的砍刀和宽边草帽看作争取土地、独立和解放的标志保存下来，表示他们不屈不挠，决不停止斗争的决心。
    美国用刺刀和大炮为它在古巴的经济奴役开拓了道路。美国军队占领古巴几年之久，在古巴国土上烧杀抢劫。军政府颁布了第六十二号军令。给美国殖民者一切特权攫取土地，从而形成了古巴最大的新庄园主。他们开始了世世代代的掠夺和榨取，像章鱼一样无穷无尽地吸吮着这块肥沃土地上的膏血。古巴蔗田面积占全部耕地面积的40％。二十六家美国糖公司就占了七万二千卡瓦耶里亚的土地，即75％的最好的蔗田。古巴一百六十一家糖厂中，最大的三十六家都是美国人的。而在其余的很多糖厂中也有美国的投资。糖厂生产能力的54％操在美国垄断资本手里。从1900年—1958年，古巴共生产了价值一百六十三亿美元的糖。这笔钱占古巴五十多年来工农业生产总值的30％左右。而美国资本家却夺去了其中的一半！利润并没有用在古巴的扩大再生产中。根据美国公司公开公布的显然缩小了的数字，以往的五十多年中，二十亿美元的糖业利润流出古巴，装进了华尔街财阀们的钱袋。
    美国为掠夺的目的而形成的古巴的单一经济使古巴成为单纯的供应美国原糖的基地。古巴生产的一百斤糖中只有六斤国内消费，其中七十五斤运往美国。古巴经济几乎完全依赖对外出口。而对外出口中，糖占了80％。这样，美国也通过糖的贸易控制了古巴的经济命脉。
    美国资本家也用贱买贵卖的办法在糖的交易中捞取巨额利润，美国商人用五点二分美金一磅的糖价进货，而在美国市场上用十一点五分美金的价格出售。古巴卖给美国的糖中，60％是原糖。美国糖业巨头把原糖炼成白糖后，每磅又可得利两分美金。古巴的白糖在美国做成方糖后，运回古巴市场销售，每磅价格提高三分美金。美国商人因为每年用高价向古巴输出十万多吨用古巴糖制成的糖果罐头等而大发横财。
    从黑夜到黎明
    单一经济和美国对古巴市场的控制像一对镣铐束缚了古巴经济的发展。除糖业外，古巴几乎没有其它工业。就是拿糖业来说，甘蔗和糖浆本来可以出产很多副产品，但在古巴甘蔗的唯一的副产品就是甜酒。农业更处于倒退和破产的境地。农村里，大片大片土地被围上象征罪恶的大庄园制的铁丝网。有时候，我们乘汽车走了几十里地，还看不到铁丝网的尽头。土地荒芜，人民饥饿。古巴人必须向美国用高价购买75％的衣食住行的必需品。古巴必须向美国进口本来能在自己土地上生产的一切：大米、土豆、菜豆、洋葱、白菜、水果……等。例如1957年，美国买了古巴四亿六千六百万美元糖，而古巴向美国却进口了五亿七千七百万美元的货物。从1948年—1958年的十年中，古巴在和美国的不平等的贸易中损失了十亿美元。古巴人民把整年辛苦劳动从世界各国换来的一点点外汇全部贴补进去还是不够。
    人们不禁要问：古巴的巨大的财富——糖，古巴的国宝甘蔗到底给了古巴人民什么好处？古巴工人和农民世世代代流尽血汗，换来了什么好处？回答是：饥饿和死亡。古巴甘蔗收割和制糖季节只有三个月，只有这个时期，糖业工人才有工作。六口之家、每个月只能得到四十五个比索。其余青黄不接的九个月古巴就有七十万人失业。人们到处流落，妻离子散。古巴人把这个每年一度的时期心酸地称为“死季”，因为它带给他们死亡。
    在漫长的黑暗的岁月里，有多少个傍晚，蔗田工人们齐集在用棕榈叶做的矮小的茅舍里，伴着“吉他”的沉重的节拍，低声哼着纪廉的诗句，表达他们对美国掠夺者的愤怒和控诉：
              黑人
            站在甘蔗园旁。
              美国佬
            站在甘蔗园之上。
              土地
            伸展在甘蔗园底下。
              鲜血
            从我们身上流光！
  有着光荣的反殖民主义传统的古巴人民，早在三十年代就在奥连特省和拉斯维利亚斯省，在全国各个地方的青纱帐里吹响海螺，集聚起来，拿起步枪和砍刀，冲向美国大地主的庄园。糖业工人在全国举行了总罢工。古巴人民的斗争像加勒比海的巨涛一样此起彼伏，汹涌前进。
    古巴人民百年来的斗争播下的火种在马埃斯特腊山里熊熊地燃烧起来了。工人、农民、爱国者都纷纷投入起义者的行列。1959年1月1日的清晨，黎明驱走了黑暗，一个华盛顿豢养的王朝倒塌了。为争取土地和独立，古巴人民付出了她的两万个优秀儿女的生命。起义军战士们把标志坚苦斗争精神，在战争中蓄下的胡子和长发保留下来。他们说，不实现土地改革，誓不理发剃须。
    在过去的一年中，古巴农民开始获得土地。他们组织了五百多个合作社。糖业工人保证了五百五十万吨糖的生产。有九家糖厂已在土改委员会的管理和经营下。古巴人民曾举行了两次震动山河的保卫土改，反对美国干涉的百万人大示威。他们用巨大的胜利送走了战斗的一年。在新的一年内，古巴人民将进一步斩断美国章鱼的吸血管，取得经济独立。古巴革命在不断向前推进，越来越成为拉丁美洲人民斗争的旗帜和火把。
    干涉和反干涉
    美国为了维护对古巴的奴役和掠夺以及害怕古巴革命对整个拉丁美洲民族民主革命运动的影响，从军事、经济、外交和宣传各方面发动了对古巴的进攻。
    艾森豪威尔手里有一个武器——经济威胁。他挥舞大棍，威胁要削减古巴糖在美国市场上的份额和降低糖价。华盛顿的议员们在国会里提出议案要求修改美古糖协定，甚至扬言要把古巴糖的份额削减到五十万吨，并以世界糖价格（即三分美金一磅）进口。目前执行的美古糖协定是在1956年签订的，到本年12月31日满期。协定规定古巴以五分点二美金一磅的牌价供应美国三百一十一万九千六百五十五吨糖。美国人把这说成是对古巴的一种“优惠”。其实，美国这样做，完全是为了保护本国糖业巨头的利益。由于古巴得到了这种“优惠”，古巴糖就不能在世界和美国市场自由竞争和贸易。美国糖业大亨这样就能用十一分多美金一磅的高价把糖销售给美国人民。羊毛总是出在羊身上。同时美国利用了这种表面上的“让步”，从1903年起就取得了对古巴进口的真正优惠。例如古巴进口大米一公担，要收关税三点七零美元，但美商只交一点八五美元。美国商人以极低的关税，排挤了古巴和其它国家的商品，把美国商品泛滥在古巴市场上。这样古巴每年在和美国的不平等的贸易中，总要损失一亿多美元。
    艾森豪威尔最近要求美国国会授予他随时可以削减古巴糖的份额和糖价的特别权力。就这样，糖成了美国干涉古巴内政的工具。
      愤怒的火焰
    今年以来，美国对古巴的干涉活动更变本加厉了。几乎每天都有美国飞机来烧古巴的甘蔗园。每个夜晚，美制飞机从美国南方的某个机场起飞，熄灭了机身上的灯火，偷偷摸摸地溜进古巴北海岸。在拉斯维利亚斯省的圣克拉拉，卡马圭省的阿莱格累，奥连特省的巴德莱，甚至哈瓦那郊区的大片丰收在望的甘蔗田上投下了美国“BRISTOL MARINE”兵工厂1959年10月制造的烧夷弹。千百个蔗田工人和士兵奋不顾身地扑灭火焰。他们紧握了步枪和砍刀，用愤怒的眼光望着北方，身旁烧焦的甘蔗还在冒烟。他们曾为每一根甘蔗付出了整年的辛劳和汗水。当起义军还在山区为夺回土地和独立而战斗的时候，五百磅的美制重型烧夷弹就曾无情地烧毁古巴和平的农村。而今天，当古巴人民正怀着喜悦的心情迎接土改后第一个甘蔗收成的时候，美制烧夷弹再一次无情地烧毁丰收在望的田园。炸弹烧红了古巴的甘蔗田，但也燃起了整个岛国的愤怒的火焰。蔗田工人决定增加工作时间，连夜抢收甘蔗。糖厂里的工人决心要从被烧焦的一千九百三十万阿罗瓦（一阿罗瓦约十一公斤多）甘蔗里榨出白糖来。铁路工人和大学生也伸出了友谊的手。他们决定到农村中义务劳动，抢收甘蔗。古巴人说，我们再不信美国人的谎言了。艾森豪威尔一面侈谈友谊，一面却让飞机来烧我们的庄稼。“战斗报”把美制烧夷弹称为艾森豪威尔送给古巴人民的“友谊”的礼物。军队用加强战斗准备，人民用加紧组织民兵和提高警惕，来回答美国的挑衅。在一眼望不到边际的蔗田上，耸立着一座座了望台。旁边停放着一辆辆救火车，随时准备出动。蔗田工人骑马串行在青纱帐中，警觉地监视着美制飞机和反革命分子的破坏。每个清晨和傍晚，哈瓦那的每个街头巷尾，都可以看见民兵操练的行列，他们的“一、二、三、四”的喊声响彻云霄。
    既然古巴人民没有害怕美国的飞机和大炮，当然也决不会被“经济大棒”所吓倒。古巴总理卡斯特罗在一次演说中说：“我们小国人民借以自卫和发展经济的最好的武器就是民族尊严，就是主权。古巴人民第一次成了自己命运的主人。人民有能力巩固革命的胜利。”他说：“以往的六十年是美国掠夺古巴的六十年。那时古巴的双手被束缚着。今天，我们自由了。土地将是我们的。我们将不会降低糖的生产，而且会增加。因为我们可以自由地和世界各国贸易。”
    更重要的是古巴正在发展自己的民族工业和多种经济。在这方面，古巴有优好的自然条件和丰富的地下资源。古巴政府已经制订了一个十二点经济发展计划。将通过提高单位面积产量的办法，减少蔗田播种面积，并提高总的产量。古巴在不久后将能供应一切进口的农产品，并争取出口。例如，古巴每年向美国进口价值四千万美元的四百二十万公担大米。播种七千卡瓦耶里亚大米，古巴就能不向美国进口。而古巴今年就计划播种六千多卡瓦耶里亚大米。古巴也将发展钢铁、石油等重工业。在五年内纺织品将能完全自给。这样，古巴将能摆脱对美国进出口的依赖和剥削，并把节约下来的钱进一步发展民族经济。
    1月29日，国家银行行长格瓦拉宣布，古巴将用反措施回答美国每一个损害古巴利益的措施；古巴将用新的法令还击每一个美国的新的威胁。商业部长塞佩罗·博尼利亚也宣布，如果美国削减古巴糖的份额和降低糖价，古巴也将对等地削减美国商品的进口。
    这些就是古巴人民的决心，也是杜莱多糖厂工人们的决心。在我们走出厂房的路上，工人洛佩司激动地对我们说：“我们是个小国，可是气概却不小。我们的敌人是一个强国，可是它已经无法再统治我们了。”
    是的，已经觉醒和站起来了的人民是任何力量都不可能使他们屈服。如果美国帝国主义者真敢向古巴进行武装干涉，他们必将会像收获季节里的甘蔗一样，在古巴人民高举起的砍刀面前倒下去。（附图片）
