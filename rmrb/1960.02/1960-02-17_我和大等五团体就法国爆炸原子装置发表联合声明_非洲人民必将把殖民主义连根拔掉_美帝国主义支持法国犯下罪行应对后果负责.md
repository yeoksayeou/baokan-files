Xinhua News Agency, February 16th. The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, and the All-China Youth Federation today issued a joint statement condemning France for exploding an atomic device in the Sahara. The statement said, "The Chinese people express strong protest against the French government's heinous act, which seriously endangers the safety of the African people and threatens world peace."

The statement pointed out, "This action by the French colonialists is a new attack on the broad masses of the African people. At the same time, it is a concrete manifestation of the collusion between French imperialism and US imperialism in adhering to policies of aggression and war and obstructing the easing of the international situation. US imperialism has instigated and supported French imperialism in committing this crime and must be held responsible for its consequences."

The statement said that atomic explosions will never frighten the rising African people. They will further strengthen their unity and struggle, and ultimately uproot all colonialism from the African continent.

The statement said, "The Chinese people fully support the African people's opposition to France's nuclear tests in the Sahara, and consistently support the African people's struggle against colonialism and for the maintenance and attainment of national independence. We will resolutely stand with the African people and all peace-loving people and countries of the world, and work tirelessly to shatter the imperialists' war policies and defend world peace."

    新华社16日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国亚非团结委员会、中华全国总工会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会、中华全国青年联合会五团体今天发表联合声明，谴责法国在撒哈拉爆炸原子装置。声明说，“中国人民对法国政府这一严重损害非洲人民安全，威胁全世界和平的罪恶行为，表示强烈的抗议。”
    声明指出，“法国殖民主义者的这种行为是对非洲广大人民的新进攻，同时也是法帝国主义同美帝国主义互相勾结，坚持侵略政策和战争政策、阻挠国际局势和缓的具体表现。美帝国主义怂恿和支持法国帝国主义犯下这一罪行，必须对其后果负责。”
    声明说，原子爆炸决吓不倒正在站起来的非洲人民，他们一定会进一步加强团结和斗争，最后把一切殖民主义从非洲大陆上连根拔掉。
    声明说，“中国人民完全支持非洲人民反对法国在撒哈拉进行核试验，并且始终不渝地支持非洲人民反对殖民主义、维护和争取民族独立的斗争。我们将坚决与非洲人民和全世界爱好和平的人民和国家在一起，为粉碎帝国主义的战争政策，保卫世界和平而不懈努力。”
