Steel "Small Foreign Groups" Enterprise Workers Don't Stop
Act as Pioneers of Technological Innovation
Xinjiang's output, quality, and variety of steel and pig iron have been raised to new levels.
Hefei's small blast furnace air supply system undergoes comprehensive reform, with all technical indicators leaping upward.
Lianyuan Anping Iron Factory achieved nineteen innovations in January, greatly increasing work efficiency.

Urumqi, February 7th (By this newspaper's dispatch) — Small foreign groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have unleashed tremendous power, promoting the vigorous development of the steel industry. Comparing January of this year with the same period last year, steel production increased by 44%, iron by 130%, and steel materials by 25.4%. The pig iron produced in one month exceeds the total annual pig iron production in 1957 before the Great Leap Forward; the large quantities of spring steel, medium carbon steel, light rails, and various construction steel materials produced not only strongly support the needs of industrial and agricultural production and basic construction in the Xinjiang region but also have 70% of the steel materials transported to support construction in other regions.

The steel industry in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has developed under the guidance of the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and integrating large, medium, and small enterprises. Now, compared with the spring of 1958, iron production capacity has increased by more than ten times, and steel production capacity has increased by three to four times.

Steel front workers are vigorously engaging in technological innovation and revolution, rapidly improving the technical level of the small foreign groups' steel industry. The Baluntai Leap Forward Steel Plant, which started with a blast furnace made from a gasoline drum, now has twelve 28-cubic-meter small blast furnaces in operation. Pig iron costs have been reduced by 50% in less than a year. The factory recovered its entire investment within one year and also turned over a profit of 8.97 million yuan to the state. The utilization coefficient of the small blast furnace in the Xinyuan Steel Plant reached 2.63. The Ding Zegao group in the Ba Yi Steel Plant achieved the outstanding result of continuous blowing of 252 heats in a converter without any rejects. The Wang Yanchun group in the No. 1 Steelmaking Workshop of the Urumqi Railway Bureau Machinery Plant created a record of continuously pouring 1,011 heats of steel without any running or leaking. As a result of technological innovations, the sulfur content of small foreign groups' pig iron generally does not exceed 0.08%, far below the national standard. The qualification rate of steel ingots has also greatly improved compared to the past. The steel ingot qualification rate in many steelmaking workshops has reached 92% to 98%, and new products such as medium carbon steel, spring steel, and light rails have been produced.

Hefei, February 7th (By this newspaper's dispatch) — Workers on the steel front in Hefei City, Anhui Province, are vigorously engaged in technological revolution, conducting comprehensive technical reforms to the air supply system of small blast furnaces, increasing wind temperature, air volume, and smelting intensity, and rapidly improving the production level of small blast furnaces.

The hot blast stoves of Hefei's small blast furnaces are all tubular. Originally, a hot blast stove could only be used for about two weeks, or at most one month, before the pipes would bend, the joints would be burned and burst, resulting in phenomena such as air leaks and decreased wind temperature, seriously affecting the improvement of the production level of small blast furnaces. In July of last year, after the No. 14 blast furnace of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee Organ Steel Plant successfully experimented with replacing the hot blast stove pipes with large pipes, the various steel plants in Hefei City universally promoted this experience and developed it into five comprehensive technical reforms to the air supply system. These are: replacing the thin cold air pipes, hot air pipes, and surrounding pipes of the air supply system with thick ones; replacing the small pipes inside the hot blast stove with large pipes; changing the "T" shaped cold air pipes to "A" shaped, reducing the elbows in the air supply pipes; replacing the spectacle valves in the air supply pipes with regulating valves or gates; expanding the inner diameter of the small sleeves of the tuyeres. For example, the diameter of the cold air and hot air pipes of a 13-cubic-meter small blast furnace were changed from the original 250 mm to 350 mm.

After the five technical renovations to the air supply system of the small blast furnaces, various pipes and tuyeres became more reasonable, and the phenomenon of hindering the smooth flow of air was greatly reduced, thereby correspondingly increasing the wind temperature, air volume, and smelting intensity. Through the five technical reforms, the blast temperature of small blast furnaces in the city generally increased by about 30% compared to the original, with the blast temperature rising from 400 degrees to 500 to 600 degrees, and the smelting intensity increased from about 1 to above 1.95. The lifespan of hot blast stoves can be extended by more than six months. For example, after increasing the pipe diameter and reducing the number of joints, the loss of air volume was greatly reduced. Generally, the difference between the cold air pressure and the hot air pressure was reduced from a loss of about 50% to about 20%. Changing the "T" shaped joints to "A" shaped joints reduced the local resistance loss of air volume by about 65% compared to the original. Replacing spectacle valves with regulating valves eliminated the need to stop or slow the air flow during hot blast stove switching, reducing fluctuations in furnace conditions and preventing air leaks from the spectacle valves.

With the continuous increase in wind temperature, air volume, and smelting intensity, the various production indicators of small blast furnaces in Hefei City have soared. In July of last year, before the technical renovations were carried out, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in the city was 0.663, the qualification rate of pig iron was only 86.5%, and the coke ratio was 1.74. After all the technical renovations were completed, the various production indicators gradually increased month by month. By January of this year, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in the city had risen to 2.34 tons, the pig iron qualification rate had increased to 97.42%, and coke consumption had been reduced to 0.954. At the same time, many high-yield furnaces emerged. In January, there were three furnaces with an average utilization coefficient of over 4, with the highest reaching 4.29, and there were eight furnaces with an average utilization coefficient of over 3.

Changsha, February 5th (Xinhua) — The Anping Iron Factory in Lianyuan County, Hunan, is vigorously engaging in technological innovation and revolution in the small foreign group iron smelting production. In January, they achieved nineteen major innovation projects, respectively increasing work efficiency by one to more than forty times. Production continued to leap forward, completing the production plan two days ahead of schedule.

This factory had already carried out a series of technological innovations last year, completing the annual pig iron production plan thirty-two days ahead of schedule with an excess of 10%. This year's pig iron production task is to increase by 56% compared to last year, and the ore production task is to increase by 1.6 times, but the labor force requirement is to be reduced by 25% compared to last year's average number. How to achieve both a large increase in production and a large saving of manpower? The factory's Party committee mobilized the masses of workers to launch a debate. After everyone contributed their clever ideas, fifty-one major technological innovation projects were proposed. After these projects are implemented, the factory can save about 30% of its labor force this year, and the annual production tasks of pig iron and ore can also strive to be completed in the third quarter.

In order to further develop the technological innovation movement, the factory established a technological innovation committee, and workshops and work areas established technological innovation teams, and made annual technological innovation plans. The smelting workshop planned to first build a narrow-gauge railway more than 120 meters long from the crushed coke yard to the side of the No. 2 blast furnace in January, using a winch to lift the coke in cars to the top of the furnace, changing from manual carrying to mechanical transportation. The entire workshop, without affecting normal production, drew more than 40 workers, under the specific leadership of the factory director and deputy director, measured and designed the project themselves. Without steel rails, they used round steel instead; without a winch, the electrical and mechanical workers cleared an electric motor from the warehouse and assembled it into a winch. After more than ten days of intense labor, they completed more than 700 cubic meters of roadbed earthwork and built a wooden bridge leading to the top of the furnace. Deputy Director Hu Dingfu, together with carpenter Yan Chunyi, also successfully trial-produced an automatic unloading car for transporting materials on the top of the furnace. Originally, 27 people were needed to carry materials to the top of the No. 2 blast furnace. Now, the lifting of coke is done with a winch, and the transportation on the top of the furnace is done with an unloading car, saving 15 workers, greatly reducing labor intensity, and ensuring the needs of smelting. Subsequently, the removal of furnace slag in front of the furnace, the crushing of raw materials in the crushed material yard, the transportation of molten iron in the foundry, and the lifting of ore in the roasting furnace were also mechanized and semi-mechanized. In terms of mining, in January, eleven level tunnels were added in three work areas, making it possible to transport all the materials in the level tunnels by car, increasing work efficiency by more than four times; using hand-cranked drills for drilling blast holes increased work efficiency by three times compared to manual labor. The No. 1 mining area also erected two cableways and installed two sliding tracks. Mining production, after technological innovation, saved more than 400 workers, and the daily output of ore increased from more than 200 tons in the past to more than 350 tons.

    钢铁“小洋群”企业职工马不停蹄
    作技术革新的急先锋
    新疆钢和生铁的产量、质量、品种已提高到新的水平
    合肥小高炉送风系统全面改革各项技术指标飞跃上升
    涟源安平铁厂一月份实现十九项革新大大提高了工效
    本报乌鲁木齐7日电　新疆维吾尔自治区小洋群发挥强大威力，促进了钢铁工业蓬勃发展。今年1月份和去年同期比较，钢增长了44％，铁增长了130％，钢材增长了25．4％。一个月生产的生铁，就比大炼钢铁以前的1957年全年的生铁产量还多；生产的大批弹簧钢、中碳钢、轻型钢轨和各种建筑钢材，不但有力地支援了新疆地区工农业生产和基本建设的需要，而且有70％的钢材将外运支援其它地区的建设。
    新疆维吾尔自治区钢铁工业是在贯彻执行土洋并举、大中小结合的方针下发展起来的。现在，同1958年春季比较，铁的生产能力增加了十几倍，钢的生产能力增加了三、四倍。
    钢铁战线职工大搞技术革新和技术革命，使小洋群钢铁工业的技术水平迅速提高。由一座汽油桶装制的高炉起家的巴仑台跃进钢铁厂，目前已经有十二座二十八立方米小高炉投入生产，生铁成本在不到一年的期间就降低了50％，一年当中就收回建厂的全部投资，还向国家上缴利润八百九十七万元。新源钢铁厂小高炉利用系数达到了二点六三，八一钢铁厂丁泽皋小组创造了转炉连续吹炼二百五十二炉无废品的优异成绩。乌鲁木齐铁路局机械厂第一炼钢车间王彦春小组创造了浇钢连续一千零一十一炉不跑钢不漏钢的纪录。由于技术革新的成果，小洋群生铁的含硫量一般都不超过0．08％，大大低于国家标准。钢锭合格率也比过去有了很大提高。许多炼钢车间钢锭合格率都达到92％至98％，并且炼出了中碳钢、弹簧钢，轻型钢轨等新产品。
    本报合肥7日电　安徽省合肥市钢铁战线的职工大闹技术革命，对小高炉送风系统进行全面的技术改革，提高了风温、风量和冶炼强度，使小高炉的生产水平迅速提高。
    合肥市小高炉的热风炉都是管式的。原来一个热风炉只能使用两星期左右，最多也不过一个月，就要发生管道烧弯，接头烧炸，形成跑风和风温下降等现象，严重地影响小高炉生产水平的提高。去年7月，当中共安徽省委机关钢铁厂十四号高炉热风炉管道改用大管道试验成功以后，合肥市各钢铁厂普遍推广了这一经验，并发展成为送风系统的全面的五项技术改革。这就是：送风系统的冷风管道、热风管道和围管由细改粗；热风炉内小管道改成大管道；冷风管道“丁”字形改为“人”字形，减少送风管道的弯头；送风管道中的眼镜阀改为调节阀或闸门；扩大风口小套内径，如十三立方米小高炉的冷风和热风管道的管径，均由原来的二百五十公厘改为三百五十公厘。
    小高炉送风系统进行五项技术改造以后，使各种管道和风口更加合理，阻碍风力畅通的现象大大减少，因而相应地提高了风温、风量和冶炼强度。通过五项技术改革，全市小高炉的入炉风温，一般比原来增加了30％左右，风温由四百度提高到五百度到六百度，冶炼强度由一左右提高到一点九五以上，热风炉的寿命可延长六个多月。如管径加粗和接头减少后，大大减少了风量的损失，一般冷风压与热风压之差，由原来损失50％左右减少到20％左右。“丁”字形接头改为“人”字形接头，局部阻力损失风量比原来减少65％左右。眼镜阀改为调节阀，使调换热风炉时不用停风或慢风操作，减少炉况的波动，也杜绝了眼镜阀的跑风现象。
    随着风温、风量和冶炼强度的不断提高，合肥市小高炉的各项生产指标飞跃上升。去年7月份在未进行技术改造以前，全市小高炉的平均利用系数是零点六六三，生铁的合格率只有86．5％，焦比是一点七四。全部进行技术改造后，各项生产指标就逐月提高。到今年1月份，全市小高炉的平均利用系数已升到二点三四吨，生铁合格率提高到97．42％，焦比消耗降低到零点九五四。同时，还涌现出了许多高产炉。1月份平均利用系数达到四以上的有三座，最高的达到四点二九，平均利用系数达到三以上的有八座。
    据新华社长沙5日电　湖南涟源县安平铁厂在小洋群炼铁生产中大闹技术革新和技术革命，1月份实现主要革新项目十九项，分别提高工效一倍到四十多倍，生产连续跃进，提前两天完成了生产计划。
    这个厂在去年已经进行过一系列的技术革新，使全年生铁生产计划提前三十二天超额10％完成。今年生铁生产任务比去年要增长56％，矿砂生产任务要增长一点六倍，可是劳动力要求比去年平均人数减少25％。怎样做到既大量增产又大批节约人力？工厂党委发动职工群众展开了鸣放辩论。经过人人献妙计，又提出了主要技术革新项目五十一项，这些项目实现之后，今年全厂就可节省出30％左右的劳动力，全年的生铁和矿砂的生产任务还可以争取在第三季度完成。
    为了进一步开展技术革新运动，厂里成立技术革新委员会，工区、车间分别成立技术革新小组，并且作出了全年的技术革新规划。冶炼车间规划1月份先从碎焦场修筑一条一百二十多米长的轻便铁路通到二号高炉炉边，用卷扬机把焦炭用车子提升到炉顶，改人力肩挑为机械运输。全车间在不影响正常生产的情况下，抽出四十多个职工，在厂长、副厂长的具体领导下，自己测量，自己设计。没有钢轨，就用元钢代替；没有卷扬机，机电工人就从仓库清出一部电动机，装配成为一部卷扬机；经过十多天的紧张劳动，完成路基土石方七百多方，架好了通往炉顶的木质天桥。副厂长胡丁福还同木工颜春仪一起，试制成功了炉顶运输的自动卸料车。原来二号高炉炉顶用二十七人肩挑运输，现在焦炭提升用卷扬机、炉顶运输用卸料车，劳动力节省了十五人，劳动强度大大减轻，还保证了冶炼需要。接着，炉前炉渣的运走，碎料场原料的破碎，翻砂间铁水的运输，焙烧炉矿砂的提升等，也都实现了机械化和半机械化。采矿方面，1月份在三个工区增修了平巷十一条，使平巷运输全部用车子，提高工效四倍以上；打炮眼用手摇扳钻，比手工提高工效三倍。采矿一工区还架设了两条索道，安装了两条滑运道。采矿生产经过技术革新，共节省出四百多个劳动力，矿砂日产量却由过去的二百多吨提高到三百五十多吨。
