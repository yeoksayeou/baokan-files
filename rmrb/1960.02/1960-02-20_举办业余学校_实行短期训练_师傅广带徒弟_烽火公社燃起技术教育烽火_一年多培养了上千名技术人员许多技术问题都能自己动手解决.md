Running spare-time schools, implementing short-term training, masters extensively taking apprentices
Fenghuo Commune ignites a blaze of technical education
Cultivating over a thousand technicians in just over a year, capable of solving many technical problems independently.

(Reported by our newspaper) The Fenghuo People's Commune in Qianxian, Shaanxi, has self-reliantly cultivated a large number of technical personnel. All twenty-nine production teams in the commune now have eight "members" (agricultural technician, water conservancy technician, forestry and horticulture technician, agricultural machinery technician, midwife, health worker, veterinarian, and inseminator). Some teams also have meteorologists, electricians, and soil technicians. Some teams have also established agricultural technology groups, water conservancy groups, weather observation posts, health stations, and midwifery stations.

This commune has always proceeded from reality and cultivated talents in practice. As early as 1958, when the commune was first established, the Party committee established two pilot projects in the Fenghuo Production Team and the Xinglong Production Team. It summarized the experience of commune member Wang Baojing, who became a scientist from an ordinary farmer, and popularized it throughout the commune. A surge of "learning from Baojing, comparing with Baojing, and catching up with Baojing" quickly emerged in each team. The number of activists participating in experimental research combined with current production increased from more than 600 before communization to more than 3,800. The commune Party committee secretary personally cultivated experimental fields. The whole commune established twenty-nine agricultural science research offices and three hundred and twenty-one specialized experimental teams (groups), cultivating a total of three thousand six hundred mu of experimental fields. Everyone learned agricultural production technology in practice.

The commune further utilized diverse forms to systematically cultivate talents. An important form is running various spare-time schools. The commune currently has five spare-time agricultural science and technology schools and twenty-nine various spare-time schools. These schools focus on practical operation, combined with learning agricultural science and technology knowledge. Students at the spare-time agricultural science and technology school established by the Fenghuo Production Team used the land allocated by the commune to conduct various experiments, studying forty-three types of projects. The schools have successively cultivated more than five hundred and ten agricultural technology talents for the commune. Cultivating talents through running short-term training classes and rotational training classes is also a form. In the past year or so, the commune has run twenty-seven short-term training classes and rotational training classes, training more than two thousand five hundred person-times in diesel engine operators, electric motor operators, health workers, veterinarians, and inseminators. Among them, two sessions of diesel engine operator training classes trained more than seventy diesel engine operators.

The commune vigorously utilized existing technical forces to cultivate new forces, implementing the method of masters taking apprentices to cultivate talents. The more skilled technicians in each team contracted to lead one or two apprentices each for individual cultivation. Meteorologist Wang Zhenying of the Dengta Production Team and meteorologist Cui Zhixue of the Cuijia Production Team learned while doing under the guidance of their masters. In one year, they were able to independently measure wind speed, air temperature, ground temperature, determine light intensity, and analyze soil moisture content. The commune also used the methods of "inviting in" and "sending out" to cultivate talents. Since the establishment of the commune, it has invited eleven experts and technicians to impart technology, including one hundred and seventy-six technical talents cultivated with the help of the Northwest Agricultural College. The commune has successively selected many commune members to study in other places. The forty-five commune members who went to the Liquan Tractor Station to study are now generally able to drive tractors independently, and some have also learned to repair them. In addition, they also cultivated talents through on-site teaching methods. Whenever the commune's farm tool repair and assembly plant and other production units had new inventions or major technological innovations, they promptly convened relevant technicians from each team to learn, do, and promote on the spot.

The Fenghuo People's Commune implemented learning in production and self-reliantly cultivated talents. In just over a year, the commune had one thousand and twenty-six technicians of various types, an increase of two times compared to before communization. Among them, there were five hundred and fifteen agricultural technicians, one hundred and eighty-four agricultural machinery technicians, and one hundred and two water conservancy technicians. Among these technicians, twenty were equivalent to the level of students in secondary agricultural technical schools, capable of installing and repairing large-scale farm tools, conducting field design, doing indoor experiments independently, understanding some of the scientific principles of hybrid breeding, initially mastering the methods of soil analysis, and being familiar with the techniques of fertilization and water use for various crops in the local area at various times. Agricultural technician Wang Xingxing of the Fenghuo Production Team, after studying, independently conducted seed analysis (variety identification) on twenty-two varieties in the room last year. Guo Yaotong and Wang Sicong of the Xinglong Production Team grew up in learning. Last year, they installed a complete set of equipment for grain and cotton processing plants for the commune and four production teams. They also created an automatic wheat screening machine, increasing work efficiency by twenty-five times, and were called "native engineers" by the commune members. Due to the growth of a large number of technical personnel, the commune has been able to solve problems independently in terms of circuit construction, the design and construction of small-scale water conservancy projects, and the installation and use of drainage and irrigation machinery. At present, this commune has achieved the goal of treating minor illnesses of people and livestock within the team, and has basically controlled swine fever and chicken plague. Diseases that have historically harmed livestock, such as anthrax and foot-and-mouth disease, have disappeared. Each team has a group of technical talents. Whenever there are major inventions, innovations, and new technical measures, they can be immediately promoted throughout the commune. For example, the wide-row intercropping and interplanting farming system researched by farmer scientist Wang Baojing of the commune has now been promoted and used in 97% of the cotton fields and 70% of the corn fields throughout the commune.

Now, this commune has decided to rotate all eight hundred young and middle-aged people in the commune through the spare-time agricultural science and technology school in the next few years, select a group of outstanding technicians from them, cultivate them into intermediate or senior agricultural technology talents, and gradually establish a commune agronomist system.

    举办业余学校　实行短期训练　师傅广带徒弟
    烽火公社燃起技术教育烽火
    一年多培养了上千名技术人员许多技术问题都能自己动手解决
    本报讯　陕西乾县烽火人民公社自力更生培养了大批技术人材。全社二十九个生产队，现在队队都有八员（农业技术员、水利技术员、林艺园艺员、农业机械员、接生员、保健员、兽医员、配种员），部分队并有气象员、电工员和土壤技术员，有的队还建立了农业技术股、水利股、气象哨、保健站、接生站等。
    这个公社一直是从实际出发，在实际中培养人材的。早在1958年公社刚建立时，党委就在烽火生产队和兴隆生产队建立了两个试点，总结了社员王保京从一个普通农民成为科学家的经验，在全社普遍推广；各队迅速掀起了“学保京、比保京、赶保京”的热潮，参加结合当前生产进行试验研究的积极分子，由公社化前的六百多人增加到三千八百多人。公社党委书记亲自种试验田，全社建立了二十九个农业科学研究室，三百二十一个专业试验队（组），共种植了三千六百亩试验田，大家在实际中学习农业生产技术。
    公社进而运用多种多样的形式系统地培养人材，其中重要的一种形式就是举办各种业余学校。全社现有业余农业科学技术学校五所，各种业余学校二十九所。这些学校都以实际操作为主，结合学习农业科学技术知识，烽火生产队设立的业余农业科学技术学校的学员们，利用公社拨给的土地进行各种试验，研究的项目达四十三种。各学校已先后为公社培养出农业技术人材五百一十多人。通过开办短期训练班和轮训班培养人材，也是一种形式。一年多以来，全社已开办短期训练班和轮训班二十七次，共培养柴油机手、电动机手、保健员、兽医员、配种员二千五百多人次，其中柴油机手训练班两期训练出七十多名柴油机手。
    公社大力运用原有技术力量培养新生力量，实行师傅带徒弟的办法培养人材，各队比较熟练的技术员都包干带领了一个到两个徒弟，个别进行培养。灯塔生产队气象员王振英和崔家生产队气象员崔志学，在师傅的指导下边做边学，一年的工夫，就能够单独地测量风速、气温、地温，确定光照强度，分析土壤含水量等。公社也运用“请进来”、“派出去”的办法来培养人材，从建社到现在已请进来传授技术的专家和技术人员有十一名，其中请西北农学院来社帮助培养出来的技术人材就达一百七十六名。公社先后选派许多社员到外地进修。到醴泉拖拉机站学习的四十五名社员，目前一般已能单独驾驶拖拉机，有的人还学会了修理。此外，他们还通过现场传授的方法培养人材。公社农具修配厂等生产单位每逢有新的创造发明或重大的技术革新，都及时召集各队有关技术员，现学现做现推广。
    烽火人民公社实行在生产中学习，自力更生培养人材，一年多的时间，全社就有了各种技术员一千零二十六人，比公社化前增加了两倍。其中农业技术员有五百一十五人，农业机械员一百八十四人，水利技术员一百零二人。这些技术员中有二十人相当于中等农业技术学校学生的水平，能够安装、修理大型农具，进行田间设计，单独做室内试验，懂得一些杂交育种的科学道理，初步掌握了土壤分析的方法，熟悉当地各种作物各个时期施肥用水的技术。烽火生产队农业技术员王行兴，经过学习后，去年在室内单独进行考种分析（品种鉴定）的品种就有二十二个。兴隆生产队郭尧通和王思聪在学习中成长，去年给公社和四个生产队安装了粮棉加工厂的全套设备，还创造了一种自动筛麦机，提高工效二十五倍，被社员称为“土工程师”。由于大批技术人员的成长，在电路的架设、小型水利工程的设计和施工、排水灌溉机械的安装和使用等方面，公社都已能自己动手解决。目前这个公社已经做到了人、畜小病不出队，基本上控制了猪疫和鸡疫。历来危害牲畜的炭疸、口蹄疫等病，已经绝迹。各队具有一批技术人材，一有重大的创造革新和新的技术措施，就马上能在全社推广开来。例如，该社农民科学家王保京研究出来的宽行间作套种的耕作制度，现在已经在全社97％的棉田和70％的玉米田里推广使用。
    现在，这个公社决定要在最近几年内，把全社八百多名青壮年，全部在业余农业科学技术学校轮训一遍，从中选出一批优秀技术员，培养成为中级或高级农业技术人材，逐步建立公社农艺师制度。
