One warm and sunny morning, three "birds" slowly flew from the beach of Huangqi Peninsula into the sky, heading towards the Matsu Islands, which were occupied by Jiang troops across the water. After the "birds" flew over the Matsu Islands, they scattered clusters of things that looked like snowflakes, which slowly drifted in all directions with the gentle breeze.

"Delivered again!" Several militiamen from the Huangqi People's Commune shouted happily. In the past year, they had used these bird-shaped kites countless times to send a large number of leaflets to the Matsu Islands. The leaflets they sent this day included photos of the new face of socialist construction across the country, pictures and leaflets of Jiang troops who had defected and reunited with their families and lived happy lives, and letters from some family members of Jiang troops to their sons or husbands, describing the improvement of their family life.

On the Fujian Front, militiamen from Xiamen, Wuyu, Weitou, and Huangqi, Dinghai and other places often used methods such as flying kites, drifting bamboo tubes, and releasing small boats to send tens of thousands of leaflets to Jinmen, Dadan, Matsu, and Baiquan Islands, which were occupied by Jiang troops. Last year, the militiamen of Lianjiang County distributed more than 400,000 leaflets and letters from family members of Jiang troops in this way. On the reefs often visited by Jiang troops, the militiamen also wrote many slogans to guide Jiang troops to the bright road, publicizing the people's government's policy towards those who defected and revolted.賀業臣賀业臣 (He Yechen) and others, the squad leader of the Jiang troops who crossed the sea and defected to the People's Liberation Army last June, said that after reading the leaflets, many Jiang troops were even more unwilling to work for the United States and missed their hometowns and relatives even more.

    蒋军的“引路人”
    在一个风和日暖的上午，三只“鸟”从黄岐半岛的滩头慢慢飞上天空，向对面蒋军盘踞的马祖列岛飞去。“鸟”飞到马祖岛上空以后，撒下一团团好像雪花的东西，随着微风，向四方飘开，徐徐降落。
    “又送到了！”黄岐人民公社的几个民兵高兴地叫了起来。过去一年中，他们曾经无数次使用这飞鸟形的风筝把大量传单送到马祖岛上。这一天他们送去的传单，有祖国各地社会主义建设新面貌的照片，有蒋军投诚人员同亲人团聚、过幸福生活的图片和传单，还有一些蒋军家属向他们的儿子或丈夫叙述家庭生活改善情形的信件。
    在福建前线，厦门、浯屿、围头和黄岐、定海等地的民兵，经常用放风筝、漂竹筒、放小船等方法，把成千上万份传单送到蒋军盘踞的金门、大担、马祖和白犬等岛屿上面。连江县的民兵，去年就这样散发了四十多万份传单和蒋军家属的信件。在蒋军常去的礁石上，民兵们还写了许多给蒋军指引光明道路，宣传人民政府对投诚起义人员政策的标语。去年六月渡海向解放军投诚的蒋军班长贺业臣等说，许多蒋军士兵看了传单以后，更加不愿为美国卖命，对家乡和亲人更加想念。
