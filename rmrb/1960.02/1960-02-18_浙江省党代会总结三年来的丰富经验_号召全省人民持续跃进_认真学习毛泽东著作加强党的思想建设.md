    Zhejiang Provincial Party Congress Summarizes Rich Experiences of the Past Three Years
    Calls on People of the Province to Continue Leaping Forward
    Conscientiously Study Mao Zedong's Works to Strengthen Party's Ideological Construction
    (Our Dispatch) The First Session of the Third Congress of the Communist Party of China in Zhejiang Province recently convened in Hangzhou. This congress summarized the situation and experiences of resolutely implementing the Party's General Line for Socialist Revolution and Socialist Construction since the Provincial Party's Second Congress in July 1956. Based on the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions, it also proposed the tasks for continuing the leap forward in 1960 and the next three years. The congress also elected the current Provincial Committee.
    The congress listened to the work report given by Jiang Hua, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, on behalf of the previous Provincial Committee. The 495 official delegates and 60 alternate delegates participating in the congress fully discussed the work report, with 232 delegates speaking at the meeting. They unanimously agreed that the summary of the past three years' work and the future tasks proposed in the report were correct. Finally, they unanimously adopted a resolution on the work report, calling on Party organizations at all levels throughout the province and the people of the province to unite as one under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, continue to hold high the glorious banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, better implement a series of "walking on two legs" policies, and muster greater efforts to strive for a better, more comprehensive, and sustained leap forward in the next three years.
    The congress noted with satisfaction that in the three years since the Second Congress of the Provincial Party, especially in 1958 and 1959, the development of the province's national economy had achieved unprecedentedly great victories. In 1958, the province's total industrial and agricultural output value increased by 50.1% compared to 1957. In 1959, the province's total industrial and agricultural output value increased by another 32.5% compared to 1958, with the total industrial output value increasing by 44.3% and the total agricultural output value increasing by 18%. Compared to 1958, the output of major industrial and agricultural products had greatly increased, with steel increasing by 340%, raw coal increasing by 50%, grain increasing by 16.1%, and cotton increasing by 19.3%. Education, science, and cultural undertakings have also greatly developed. With the development of industrial and agricultural production, the income of workers and peasants increased correspondingly compared to 1958. The average wage of workers and staff (excluding new workers) increased by about 5%, and the average net income per member of the People's Commune increased by about 13%.
    The congress emphasized that the great achievements of the continuous Great Leap Forward in the past three years, especially the past two years, are the result of the province's Party organizations and the people of the province adhering to the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, implementing a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, and carrying out a vigorous mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy. In particular, the realization of the people's commune system in the province's rural areas in 1958 ensured a continuous great leap forward in agriculture and promoted the comprehensive great development of farming, animal husbandry, forestry, fishing, and sideline production. After the rectification and construction in 1959, the People's Communes have embarked on the road of consolidation and sound development, and the commune economy has seen tremendous growth. The People's Communes throughout the province have established more than 11,000 farm tool factories, fertilizer factories, and various agricultural and sideline product processing factories; established 536 farms and 1,871 livestock farms; built more than 210 reservoirs with a storage capacity of more than one million cubic meters; carried out large-scale afforestation and soil improvement; and established a large number of small hydropower stations, creating a good start for the mechanization and electrification of agriculture.
    After analyzing the current excellent situation, the congress, based on the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and the spirit of the Party Central Committee's instructions, determined the basic tasks for Zhejiang Province in the next three years and proposed the main targets for the development of the national economy in 1960. The congress called for a vigorous mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy centered on technological innovation and technological revolution in 1960, actively carrying out a cultural revolution that complements the technological revolution, and achieving a better, more comprehensive, and sustained leap forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959. It demanded that major industrial products such as steel and coal have significant growth in 1960, and major agricultural products such as grain and cotton have a leaping development. Industrial production must actively support the technological transformation of agriculture, vigorously strengthen the construction of heavy industries such as metallurgy, machinery, coal, chemicals, and electricity, and actively develop light industry. Agricultural production must comprehensively develop farming, animal husbandry, forestry, fishing, and sideline occupations, and actively and systematically carry out agricultural technological transformation. It demanded that cultural, educational, scientific, health, capital construction, transportation, commerce, and other undertakings also have tremendous development.
    The congress believes that the main way to continue developing the province's national economy at a high speed is to deeply and persistently carry out a mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, and continuously improve labor productivity. Currently, this movement is vigorously developing throughout the province and has developed into major reforms in mechanical equipment and large-scale, comprehensive technological transformations by industry and by type of work. This movement must continue to be pushed to a new climax. In technological innovation and technological revolution, it is necessary to continue to break down superstitions, liberate thinking, and promote the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do. Party organizations at all levels must strengthen leadership over the movement, focus on pace-setters, focus on on-site promotion, focus on inspection and evaluation, deeply carry out the labor competition of "comparing, learning, catching up, and helping," and continuously transform advanced levels into universal levels.
    Regarding the Party's ideological and organizational construction in the future, the congress emphasized that the entire Party must conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, which is the most important task for the Party's ideological construction in the future. The congress pointed out that Chairman Mao's theories and policies on socialist revolution, and his theories and policies on socialist construction, are the theoretical foundation of the Party's General Line, the ideological foundation of the Party's unity and unification, and the fundamental guarantee for the victory of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction. Therefore, Party organizations at all levels throughout the province must lead the entire Party, especially Party cadres, in conscientiously studying Chairman Mao's works and widely publicizing Mao Zedong Thought to the broad masses. While strengthening the Party's ideological construction work, it is necessary to further strengthen the leading core of Party organizations at all levels, further strengthen and rectify the Party's grassroots organizations, and better play the role of Party branches as fighting fortresses, so as to organizationally guarantee the implementation of the Party's General Line.

    浙江省党代会总结三年来的丰富经验
    号召全省人民持续跃进
    认真学习毛泽东著作加强党的思想建设
    本报讯　中共浙江省第三届代表大会第一次会议最近在杭州举行。这次大会总结了1956年7月全省党的第二届代表大会以来，坚决执行党的社会主义革命和社会主义建设总路线的情况和经验，并根据党中央指示的精神，提出了1960年和今后三年继续跃进的任务。大会还选举了本届省委员会。
    代表大会听取了省委第一书记江华代表上届省委所作的工作报告。参加大会的四百九十五名正式代表和六十名候补代表，对工作报告展开了充分的讨论，有二百三十二位代表在会上发言，一致认为报告中对过去三年工作的总结和所提出的今后各项任务是正确的。最后一致通过了关于这个工作报告的决议，号召全省各级党组织和全省人民，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，团结一致，继续高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光荣旗帜，更好地贯彻执行一系列的“两条腿走路”的方针，鼓起更大干劲，为实现今后三年更好的全面的持续跃进而奋斗。
    代表大会满意地指出，全省党的第二届代表大会以来的三年中，特别是1958年和1959年，全省国民经济的发展获得了空前伟大的胜利。1958年全省工农业总产值比1957年增长50．1％。1959年全省工农业总产值又比1958年增长32．5％，其中工业总产值增长44．3％，农业总产值增长18％。同1958年相比，工农业主要产品的产量都有了很大的增长，其中钢增长340％，原煤增长50％，粮食增长16．1％，棉花增长19．3％。教育科学文化事业也得到了大发展。随着工农业生产的发展，工人和农民的收入比1958年有了相应的增加，职工（不包括新职工）平均工资增长5％左右，人民公社社员每人平均纯收入增长13％左右。
    代表大会着重指出，三年来，特别是两年来连续大跃进的伟大成就，是全省党组织和全省人民在党中央和毛主席的领导下，坚持总路线、大跃进、人民公社，贯彻执行一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约群众运动的结果。特别是1958年全省农村实现了人民公社化，保证了农业的持续大跃进，促进了农牧林渔副的全面大发展。经过1959年的整顿和建设以后，人民公社已经走上巩固和健全发展的道路，公社经济有了巨大的增长。全省人民公社举办了一万一千多个农具厂、肥料厂和各种农副产品加工厂；建立了五百三十六个农场、一千八百七十一个畜牧场；兴建了二百一十多处蓄水量在一百万立方米以上的水库；大规模地进行了封山造林和改良土壤，并大量地建立了小型发电站，为农业的机械化、电气化创造了良好的开端。
    代表大会在分析了目前的大好形势以后，根据党的社会主义建设总路线和党中央指示的精神，确定了浙江省今后三年的基本任务，提出了1960年国民经济发展的主要指标。代表大会要求1960年大搞以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约群众运动，积极开展和技术革命相辅而行的文化革命，在1958年和1959年大跃进的基础上，实现更好的全面的持续跃进。要求1960年钢、煤等主要工业产品都有很大的增长，粮、棉等主要农业产品都有跃进的发展，工业生产要积极支援农业的技术改造，大力加强冶金、机械、煤炭、化学、电力等重工业的建设，同时积极发展轻工业。农业生产必须全面发展农牧林渔副各业，积极地、有步骤地进行农业技术改造。要求文教科学卫生、基本建设、交通运输、商业等事业也都有巨大的发展。
    代表大会认为，继续高速度地发展全省国民经济的主要途径，是深入地、持久地开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心内容的增产节约群众运动，不断地提高劳动生产率。目前这个运动正在全省范围内蓬勃开展，已经发展到机械设备上的重大改革，发展到按行业、按工种进行大规模的、全面的技术改造。必须把这个运动继续推向新的高潮。在技术革新和技术革命中，要继续破除迷信，解放思想，发扬敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格。各级党组织要加强对运动的领导，抓标兵，抓现场推广，抓检查评比，深入开展“比、学、赶、帮”的劳动竞赛，不断地使先进水平很快地变为普遍的水平。
    关于党在今后的思想建设和组织建设方面，代表大会着重指出，全党必须认真学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席著作，这是今后党在思想建设方面的最重大的任务。代表大会指出，毛主席关于社会主义革命的理论和政策，关于社会主义建设的理论和政策，是党的总路线的理论基础，是党的团结和统一的思想基础，是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设胜利的根本保证。因此，全省各级党组织必须领导好全党特别是党员干部，认真地学习毛主席著作，向广大群众广泛地宣传毛泽东思想。在加强党的思想建设工作的同时，必须进一步加强各级党组织的领导核心，进一步加强和整顿党的基层组织，更好地发挥党支部的战斗堡垒作用，以便从组织上保证党的总路线的贯彻执行。
