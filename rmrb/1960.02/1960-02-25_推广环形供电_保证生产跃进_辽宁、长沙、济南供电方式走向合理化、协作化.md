    Promote Ring Power Supply  Ensure Production Leap Forward
    Liaoning, Changsha, and Jinan Power Supply Methods are Becoming Rationalized and Collaborative
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Many power supply units, factories, mining enterprises, government offices, schools, and other electricity-consuming units in Liaoning Province have broken away from the old power supply and consumption methods, implementing "simplification, voltage increase, and ring power supply" of the power distribution system, as well as large-scale cooperation between power supply and consumption. According to incomplete statistics from nine cities including Shenyang, 490 industrial enterprises have preliminarily reformed the power supply and consumption systems or implemented power supply and consumption cooperation. Including enterprises, government offices, organizations, schools, and urban households, the number has reached thousands. All units or power supply areas that have undergone reforms have greatly increased power supply capacity, reduced power loss, and improved voltage quality, while streamlining electrical equipment and maintenance personnel, thus ensuring safer and more reliable power supply and playing an important role in guaranteeing the continued leap forward in industrial production.
    In the process of specifically applying the experience of Harbin in reforming the power distribution system, Liaoning Province further developed this experience. Cities have begun to conduct comprehensive planning and expand the scope of transformation. For example, Fushun City has begun to combine the reform of the power distribution system (electricity consumption system) with the reform of the power supply system. Small ring power supply within the factory, large ring power supply outside the factory, combined with each other; power supply departments and electricity consumption departments work together to carry out the reform. Many continuous production enterprises such as Shenyang Glass Factory have explored the experience of reforming the power supply and distribution system without stopping production by adopting methods such as erecting temporary lines and carrying out phased and segmented renovations.
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Based on learning from Harbin's experience in ring power supply, the Changsha City Power Department creatively implemented "five-in-one" ring power supply and "three-phase-one-ground system" and "multi-household-one-meter system." After this experience was promoted in the Dongfeng power supply area of Changsha, it improved power supply capacity, saved a large amount of electricity and electrical equipment, and ensured more supply with less loss, in a rational and safe manner.
    The "five-in-one" ring power supply method combines many branches of power transmission lines into a ring, realizing the integration of power and lighting, the integration of public electricity and residential electricity, the integration of large enterprises and small enterprises, the integration of internal factory power grids and public power grids, and the integration of users' standby equipment. This ring power supply system includes fourteen large and small enterprises, as well as some government offices, shops, and households, under the jurisdiction of the district.
    This new power supply method, due to the combination of various power transmission lines into a ring, unified adjustment of voltage, centralized power supply, broke the boundary of past single power supply, achieved mutual support of power, and promoted the development of production. Before the reform, the Xinsheng Brick Factory had low voltage and the motor sometimes couldn't start. After the reform, the voltage increased by more than 60 volts, the motor speed increased, and the daily cement production increased from 40 tons to 60 tons, an increase of 40%.
    "Five-in-one" ring power supply has also saved a large amount of electricity and electrical materials for the country, creating favorable conditions for supporting industrial production and realizing rural electrification. According to preliminary statistics, this power supply area has dismantled transformers with a capacity of more than 2,000 kVA, 16,000 meters of copper wire, and a large amount of other electrical materials, worth more than 104,500 yuan, and can reduce power loss by 35,000 kWh. Due to the tapping of equipment potential, the utilization rate of transformers in these fourteen factories increased from 57% to 90%, and the safety and reliability of power supply have also been strengthened.
    In the construction process, internal wiring worker Pan Peiming proposed the suggestion of removing the grounding wire and using underground tap water pipes for grounding, which was finally successful after five tests. This creation changed the original circuit from "three-phase four-wire" to "three-phase-one-ground system." The promotion of this experience alone dismantled more than 70 poles of lines.
    At present, Changsha City is actively working to promote this experience and plans to establish nine ring power supply areas in the city, striving to realize "five-in-one" ring power supply throughout the city in the first quarter.
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The advanced experience of "simplification, voltage increase, and ring power supply" of the power distribution system has been rapidly promoted in Jinan City. According to incomplete statistics, due to the promotion of this experience, the city has dismantled 1,475 kVA of transformers, 16,660 meters of copper wire, 24.5 tons of electric wire, and many other materials such as lightning arresters and distribution panels, worth 680,000 yuan, and can save more than 100,000 kWh of electricity every year.
    After the simplification of the power distribution system, the workload of maintenance and repair of electrical equipment has been greatly reduced, personnel have been reduced, and labor productivity has been improved. For example, Sifang Locomotive Factory reduced the 3,300-volt distribution line from eight circuits to four circuits, dismantled four sets of high-voltage switch distribution panels, correspondingly reduced the maintenance workload, and can free up hands to enrich other aspects of work. After some factories increased the voltage of the power distribution system, the power transmission capacity of the power distribution lines was improved. The Cangkou Branch of Sifang Locomotive Factory closely cooperated with the Electric Power Bureau during the Spring Festival to change the original 20,000-volt power transmission line to 35,000 volts, which not only solved the problem that the power could not meet the needs, but also enabled the Electric Power Bureau to transmit an additional 10,000 kW of power to the northern system.

    推广环形供电  保证生产跃进
    辽宁、长沙、济南供电方式走向合理化、协作化
    本报讯　辽宁省许多供电单位和厂矿企业、机关、学校等用电单位纷纷打破旧的供电用电方式，实行配电系统的“简化、升压、环形供电”以及供、用电大合作。据沈阳等九个市的不完全统计，初步改革供、用电系统或实行供、用电合作的工业企业已有四百九十个，加上企业、机关、团体、学校和城市住户，为数已达数千个。凡是进行改革的单位或供电区，都在精简了电气设备和维护人员的情况下，大大增加了供电能力，减少了电力的损耗，提高了电压的质量，保证供电更加安全、可靠，因此对保证工业生产的继续跃进起了重要的作用。
    辽宁省在具体运用哈尔滨市改革配电系统经验的过程中，又进一步发展了这一经验。各市都开始进行全面规划，扩大了改造的范围。如抚顺市已经开始将配电系统（用电系统）的改革和供电系统的改革结合起来。厂内搞小环形供电，厂外搞大环形供电，互相结合；供电部门与用电部门一齐动手，共同进行改革。沈阳玻璃厂等许多连续性生产的企业，采取架设临时线、分片分段轮流改造等办法，摸索出不停止生产进行供配电系统改革的经验。
    本报讯　长沙市电力部门在学习哈尔滨环形供电经验的基础上，创造性地实行了“五合一”环形供电和“三相一地制”、“多户一表制”。这一经验在长沙东风供电区重点推行后，提高了供电能力，节省了大量电力和电器设备，保证了多供少损，合理安全。
    “五合一”环形供电的方法是将许多输电线的支线合成环形，实现动力与照明合一，公用电与民用电合一，大企业与小企业合一，厂内电网与公用电网合一，用户的备用设备合一。这个环形供电系统包括该区所属的十四个大小企业和一部分机关、商店和住户。
    这种新的供电方式，由于将各输电线路合成环形，统一调整了电压，集中供电，打破了过去单一供电的界限，做到电力互相支援，促进了生产的发展。新生砖厂在改革前电压低，马达有时开不动，改革后电压升高六十多伏，马达转速加快了，水泥日产量由四十吨提高到六十吨，增产40％。
    “五合一”环形供电还为国家节省了大量的电力和电器材料，给支援工业生产和农村实现电气化创造了有利条件。据初步统计，这个供电区已拆除变压器容量达二千多千伏安，铜线一万六千米，以及其他大量电气材料，价值达十万零四千五百多元，并可减少电力损耗三万五千度。由于挖掘了设备潜力，这十四个工厂变压器的利用率由57％提高到90％，供电的安全可靠性也加强了。
    在施工过程中，内线工潘佩明提出拆除接地线，利用地下自来水管接地的建议，经过五次试验终于成功。这个创造使原来的线路由“三相四线”改变为“三相一地制”。单是推行这一经验，就拆除了线路七十多档。
    目前，长沙市正积极着手推广这一经验，计划在市内建立九个环形供电区，力争在第一季度内全市实现“五合一”环形供电。
    本报讯　配电系统“简化、升压、环行供电”的先进经验，已在济南市迅速推广。据不完全统计，由于推行这一经验，全市已拆下变压器一千四百七十五千伏安、铜线一万六千六百六十米、电线二十四吨半及其他避雷器、配电盘等许多器材，价值六十八万元，每年可节约十多万度电。
    配电系统简化以后，大大减少了电气设备维护检修的工作量，减少了人员，提高了劳动生产率。如四方机车厂把三千三百伏配电线由八趟减少到四趟，拆减了四套高压开关配电盘，相应地减少了维修工作量，可以腾出手来充实其他方面的工作。有些厂配电系统升压后，提高了配电线路的送电能力，四方机车厂沧口分厂在春节期间和电业局密切配合，把原来二万伏的送电线路改为三万五千伏，不但解决了电力不能满足需要的问题，而且使电业局可以向北部系统多送一万瓩的电力。
