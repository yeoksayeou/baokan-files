    The "Cold War" Wind
    Editorial from "People's News," Organ of the Finnish Communist Party, January 13th

    The current development of the international situation seems to bring many positive, new, and hopeful features, but there are reasons to issue serious warnings against overly unrealistic fantasies and a loss of vigilance. Indeed, mutual visits between Eastern and Western politicians have brought a new spirit to the world, and anti-war sentiment has spread more widely in the West. Indeed, the revolutionary Great Leap Forward in the economies and politics of socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's ever-increasing dominant position in cosmic science and other fields, the spread of peaceful ideas throughout the world, and even the divisions within the North Atlantic Alliance caused by the "Cold War" have forced the American leadership to adopt a more realistic attitude towards the balance of international forces than in the past. A summit meeting is about to be held, but on the other hand, it would be futile to imagine that the Western leaders' intentions have undergone some major change and that their policies have undergone some decisive shift.

    President Eisenhower's trip to Eurasia provides a good example. At the beginning, world newspapers took a relatively cautious attitude towards this trip, and people smelled a certain new "Camp David spirit" in the President's speeches, but from the beginning, it was perhaps more of a rehash of old tunes and a walk down the "Cold War" road. In addition, it was openly pointed out that Eisenhower's trip was a reassuring trip for those who feared a peaceful turn in the "Cold War" and believed that this would affect their position. American newspapers themselves went further, saying that Eisenhower's visit was "like a general going to the front to boost morale," and the British "Daily Telegraph" said that "when a peace envoy arrives with an olive branch at what is actually a 'Cold War' council, the visit becomes incompatible with his peaceful gesture."

    While the Western newspapers themselves are expressing dissatisfaction with the unchanged American policy, the Chinese people have paid particular attention to the fact that the United States is sparing no effort to arm the Southeast Asia military bloc in the Far East. The United States' activities in Taiwan also confirmed the statement by the commander of the U.S. Pacific Army: the Cold War in Asia has not slackened, and "hot war is not impossible."

    However, activities to undermine the "Camp David spirit" are continuing not only in Asia but also in Europe. It is no coincidence that the international Swastika offensive of neo-Nazi elements is now beginning; it is also no coincidence that Federal Chancellor Adenauer ran to the West Berlin powder keg for the first time at this time and made speeches in a threatening tone. Eisenhower's hesitation and the influence of the "Cold War" headquarters on him may bring unexpected consequences before the summit meeting. Therefore, maintaining and strengthening the vigilance of the people of all countries on the issue of peace remains particularly important.

### “冷战”之风  芬兰共产党机关报“人民新闻”一月十三日社论

    “冷战”之风
    芬兰共产党机关报“人民新闻”一月十三日社论
    目前国际局势的发展似乎带来了许多积极的、新的、给人希望的特征，但有理由对过分不切实际的幻想和失去警惕提出严肃警告。确实，东西方政治家的相互访问给世界带来了新的精神，在西方厌战情绪也更加广泛地蔓延。的确，社会主义国家，尤其是苏联的经济和政治的革命大跃进，苏联在宇宙科学等方面不断增强的优势地位，和平思想的遍及世界和甚至在北大西洋联盟内部也因“冷战”而产生的分歧，已经迫使美国领导对待国际力量的对比采取比过去较现实的态度。最高级会议即将举行，但另一方面，如果设想西方国家领导的意愿已有某种大改变，和其政策已发生某种决定性的转变，那是枉然的。
    艾森豪威尔总统的欧亚之行提供了很好的例子。开始时，世界报纸对这次旅行采取了比较谨慎的态度，并且人们在总统的讲话中也闻到某种新的“戴维营精神”，但从一开始起或许更多的还是重弹老调和走“冷战”道路。此外，人们公开指出，艾森豪威尔之行对那些害怕“冷战”中有和平的转折、并认为这将影响他们的地位的人来说，是一次安抚旅行。美国自己的报纸走得更远，说艾森豪威尔的访问就“好像一位将军到前线去进行鼓励士气一样”，英国“每日电讯报”说“当和平使者戴着橄榄枝抵达实际上是一个‘冷战’的理事会时，这一访问变得同他的和平姿态不相调和”。
    在西方自己报纸都对美国政策不变表示不满时，中国人民特别注意到，美国不惜一切努力在远东武装东南亚军事集团。美国在台湾的活动也证实了美国太平洋陆军司令的声明：亚洲的冷战并未松弛，“热战并非不可能”。
    但是，破坏“戴维营精神”的活动不仅在亚洲而且也在欧洲继续着，新纳粹分子的国际卐字攻势正是现在开始，并不是偶然的；正在这个时候联邦总理阿登纳也首次跑到西柏林火药桶去，用威胁性的语调发表讲话，也不是偶然的，艾森豪威尔的犹豫和“冷战”司令部对他的影响，在最高级会议以前，还可能带来预期不到的后果。因此，保持和加强各国人民在和平问题上的警惕性，仍然是特别重要的。
