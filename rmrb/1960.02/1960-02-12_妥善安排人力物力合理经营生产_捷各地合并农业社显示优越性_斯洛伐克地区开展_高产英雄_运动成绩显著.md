Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 10th. Currently in the rural areas of Czechoslovakia, people are busy merging small Unified Agricultural Cooperatives into larger cooperatives.

At the meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia held in September last year, Comrade Novotny, First Secretary of the Party, suggested that if all conditions are ripe, and with the consent of the members of the cooperative, Unified Agricultural Cooperatives with less than 300 hectares of land could be merged. This suggestion has been enthusiastically supported by the majority of members.

The Domazlice district of the Pilsen region has merged the original 52 Unified Agricultural Cooperatives into 17. The largest of these includes the previous six small cooperatives and has 1,400 hectares of land. The 51 cooperatives in the Usti region have been merged into 23 new large cooperatives, the largest of which has 700 to 900 hectares of land. The 49 cooperatives in the Liberec region have also decided to merge into 21 large cooperatives. Some advanced cooperatives have taken the initiative to merge with backward cooperatives and have provided them with strong assistance.

Merged Unified Agricultural Cooperatives have shown great superiority in properly arranging manpower and materials, managing production more rationally, and maximizing the use of machinery. For example, in the Chrudim district of the Pardubice region, four smaller cooperatives, each with 80 to 130 hectares of land, merged and absorbed some individual farmers to form a large cooperative with 700 hectares of land. This cooperative decided to specialize in agricultural production based on the different production conditions of the original small cooperatives. Two of them will specialize in planting sugar beets, and two will specialize in planting grains and potatoes. In terms of livestock breeding, one of the original small cooperatives will specialize in raising cattle, one in raising pigs, and one will be responsible for cattle fattening, etc. The pig breeding work is about to be automated: without increasing the amount of labor, one person will be able to take care of 200 pigs instead of 40. In the Kromeriz district of Moravia, the two cooperatives that merged in May last year have been able to purchase their own tractors and make good use of their specialized talents. In some communities in the Jihlava region, after the merger, grain production increased from 22 quintals per hectare to 26 quintals per hectare within one year. After the merger of small cooperatives, the income of the members has also increased due to the increase in labor productivity and production volume.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 11th. In the Slovak region of Czechoslovakia, a "High-Yield Hero" movement to plant high-yield experimental fields has achieved significant results.

This movement was launched last year by four Slovak cooperatives with the aim of obtaining the highest yields in experimental fields in order to promote the farming experience gained. During the movement, farmers from the Trebišov cooperative harvested 917 quintals of sugar beets per hectare in an experimental field, while the national average yield of sugar beets in 1957 was about 298 quintals per hectare. The Youth Village Cooperative harvested 1,296 quintals of feed corn per hectare of experimental field, and a farm affiliated to the Komarno Agricultural College harvested 43 quintals of corn and 710 quintals of feed beets per hectare. Other cooperatives and farms participating in this movement have also achieved good results.

Because of these achievements, members of the Youth Village Cooperative have now decided to expand the feed corn experiment to 10 hectares, and the Trebišov Cooperative has set a goal of planting 5 hectares of sugar beet experimental fields, with a harvest of 1,300 quintals per hectare.

Encouraged by the achievements, more and more cooperatives and farms in Slovakia are participating in the "High-Yield Hero" movement.

    妥善安排人力物力合理经营生产
    捷各地合并农业社显示优越性
    斯洛伐克地区开展“高产英雄”运动成绩显著
    新华社布拉格10日电　目前在捷克斯洛伐克的农村中，人们正忙于把小的统一农业合作社合并成较大的合作社。
    在捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会去年9月间举行的会议上，党的第一书记诺沃提尼同志建议：如果一切条件成熟，在合作社的社员们愿意的条件下，就可以把拥有不到三百公顷土地的统一农业合作社加以合并。这个建议得到了广大社员的热烈支持。
    比尔森州的道美兹利斯县已将原有的五十二个统一农业合作社合并成十七个。其中最大的包括以前的六个小合作社，拥有一千四百公顷土地。乌斯蒂州的五十一个合作社已合并成为二十三个新的大合作社，其中最大的拥有七百到九百公顷土地。列勃里兹州的四十九个合作社也决定合并成二十一个大合作社。有的先进合作社主动提出和落后的合作社合并，并且对它们进行大力帮助。
    合并后的统一农业合作社在妥善安排人力、物力，更合理地经营生产，以及更大限度地利用机器等方面显示了极大的优越性。例如，在巴多比斯州的克罗地姆县，四个较小的各自拥有八十到一百三十公顷土地的合作社合并，并且吸收若干单干户，成立了一个拥有七百公顷土地的大合作社。这个合作社决定依据原有各小社的不同生产条件从事农业生产的专业化。其中两个将专门种植甜菜，两个专门种植谷物和马铃薯。在牲畜饲养方面，一个原来的小社专门养牛，一个专门养猪，一个专门负责牛的育肥工作等。猪的饲养工作即将实现自动化：在不增加劳动量的情况下，一个人将从照料四十只猪提高到照料二百只。在摩拉维亚州的克罗密律兹县，去年5月间合并的两个合作社已有能力购置自己的拖拉机，并妥善利用自己的专门人才。伊赫拉伐州的一些社在合并以后，一年之内谷物产量从每公顷二十二公担增至二十六公担。小社合并后，由于劳动生产率和生产量的提高，社员们的收入也提高了。
    新华社布拉格11日电　在捷克斯洛伐克的斯洛伐克地区，一个种植高产试验田的“高产英雄”运动已经获得了显著的成绩。
    这一运动是去年由四个斯洛伐克合作社发起的，目的是在试验田中获取最高产量，以便推广由此而获得的耕作经验。在运动过程中，特雷比索夫合作社的农民们在一公顷的试验田中收获了九百一十七公担甜菜，而1957年全国甜菜的平均产量是每公顷二百九十八公担左右。青年村合作社每公顷试验田收获一千二百九十六公担饲养玉米，科马诺农业学院所属的一个农场每公顷收获四十三公担的玉米和七百一十公担的饲料甜菜。参加这一运动的其它合作社和农场也获得了很好的成绩。
    由于这些成就，青年村合作社的社员现在决定把饲料玉米的试验计划扩大到十公顷，特雷比索夫合作社规定的目标是种五公顷甜菜试验田，每公顷收获一千三百公担。
    在已取得的成就的鼓舞下，斯洛伐克正有愈来愈多的合作社和农场参加“高产英雄”运动。
