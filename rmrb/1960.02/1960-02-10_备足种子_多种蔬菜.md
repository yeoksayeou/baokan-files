    Prepare Sufficient Seeds, Grow More Vegetables
    The weather is getting warmer day by day, and the sowing season is about to begin. In seed preparation this year, special attention should be paid to the preparation of vegetable seeds. Not only should sufficient seeds be prepared for spring vegetables, but also the propagation of autumn vegetable seeds should be carried out in spring.
    Vegetables are necessities for people's lives and a major aspect of improving people's livelihoods. Therefore, while developing grain production, it is essential to give sufficient importance to vegetable production, especially this year. Because agricultural production has made great leaps forward for two consecutive years, and people's lives have gradually improved, people's demands for vegetables are increasing. They require not only a large quantity but also a complete variety and good quality. At the same time, one-third of China's cultivated land suffered from varying degrees of drought and flood last year. Although we relied on the people's communes to overcome natural disasters, grain production was still reduced in some areas. In these areas, it is even more necessary to plant and grow more vegetables early in order to adjust for the shortage of grain during the lean season.
    To plant early and grow more vegetables, sufficient vegetable seeds are needed. Most areas have been grasping the preparation of spring sowing seeds and the propagation of autumn vegetable seeds early, tightly, and meticulously this year. However, there are also a few areas that have not paid enough attention to vegetable seed preparation, with insufficient preparation of spring sowing seeds and autumn vegetable seed propagation plans not yet implemented in production teams. If this problem is not resolved as soon as possible, it will affect the completion of this year's spring vegetable sowing task and autumn vegetable seed retention task. Therefore, we should seize the period before sowing, and quickly prepare sufficient spring sowing seeds and do a good job in the propagation of autumn vegetable seeds. Areas with insufficient quantity and poor quality of spring sowing seeds should fully mobilize the masses, tap potential, and organize mutual exchange and adjustment between counties and counties, and between communes and communes; and should adopt various effective methods to save seed during sowing to ensure the completion of the vegetable sowing plan. For autumn vegetable seed propagation plans that have not yet been implemented in production teams, plans should be quickly implemented to the teams and to the land, with designated personnel to manage them from sowing to harvesting, to ensure the simultaneous propagation of autumn vegetable seeds during the spring sowing season. In particular, for vegetable seeds propagated on behalf of the state, concrete measures should be taken to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of tasks. In areas where mother plants are insufficient, immediate efforts should be made to select and retain enough from commercial vegetables, or mobilize the masses to "eat vegetables and keep the roots." If necessary, some vegetables should be eaten less or not eaten at all and kept as vegetable seeds. The retained mother plants and vegetable roots should be managed by designated personnel, stored separately, and planted in time. In areas where vegetable production and marketing contracts have not yet been signed, local agricultural and commercial departments should immediately sign contracts with production units. In short, this year, all localities should conscientiously and practically implement the seed work policy of "self-propagation, self-selection, self-retention, and self-use, supplemented by adjustments" in vegetable production to ensure self-sufficiency with surplus and preparation for adjustments.

    备足种子　多种蔬菜
    天气日益转暖，播种季节就要开始了。在备种工作中，今年应当特别注意做好蔬菜的备种工作，不但要为春菜准备足够的种子，而且要在春季就做好秋菜种子的繁殖工作。
    蔬菜是人民生活的必需品，是人民生活改善的一个主要方面。因此，我们在发展粮食生产的同时，对蔬菜生产也予以足够的重视是十分必要的，特别是今年，更要对蔬菜生产加以重视。因为农业生产连续两年大跃进，人民生活逐步提高，人们对蔬菜的要求是愈来愈高了，不仅要求量多，而且要求品种齐全、质量好。同时，去年我国有三分之一的耕地遭受不同程度的水旱灾害，虽然我们依靠人民公社战胜了自然灾害，但仍然有些地区造成粮食减产，在这些地区更需要早种和多种蔬菜，以便在青黄不接时调剂粮食的不足。
    要早种、多种蔬菜，就需要有足够的蔬菜种子。对于春播菜种的准备工作和秋菜种子的繁殖工作，今年大部地区都抓得早、抓得紧，而且也抓得细。但是也有少数地区对蔬菜备种工作尚未引起足够重视，春播种子准备不足，秋菜种子繁殖计划尚未落实到生产队。这问题如不尽早解决，将会影响到今年春菜播种任务和秋菜留种任务的完成。因此，应当抓紧播种以前的这段时期，赶紧准备足够的春播菜子和做好秋菜种子的繁殖工作。春播菜种数量不够、质量不好的地区，应当充分发动群众、挖掘潜力，组织县和县、社和社之间互相串换、调剂解决；并应在播种时采取各种有效的节约用种办法，以保证蔬菜播种计划的完成。秋菜种子繁殖计划还没有落实到生产队的，要赶紧将计划落实到队、到地，指定专人管理，从种到收，一包到底，以便在春播时期同时做好秋菜种子繁殖工作。特别是代国家繁殖的菜种，更要采取切实措施，保证完成和超额完成任务。母株不足的地区，要立即着手，从商品菜中选够留足，或者发动群众“吃菜留根”，必要时有些菜还要少吃或不吃、留作菜种。留出的母株和菜根，要指定专人专责管理，分贮保管，及时种下。还没有签订蔬菜产销合同的地区，当地农、商部门要立即与生产单位签订合同。总之，今年各地在蔬菜生产上，要认真地切实地贯彻“自繁、自选、自留、自用，辅之以调剂”的种子工作方针，保证做到自给有余、调剂有备。
