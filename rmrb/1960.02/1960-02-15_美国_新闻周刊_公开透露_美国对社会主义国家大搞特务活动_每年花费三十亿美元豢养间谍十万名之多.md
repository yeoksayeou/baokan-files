Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 14th: The United States employs 100,000 personnel and spends 3 billion US dollars annually on espionage activities against socialist countries.

The above facts were acknowledged in an article describing American espionage and intelligence activities in the February 8th issue of the American magazine "Newsweek." The article revealed that the US government sends spies to infiltrate socialist countries and uses other various despicable methods to gather political, military, and economic intelligence from socialist countries.

The article stated, "The US global intelligence system currently has more than a dozen major agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the Naval Intelligence Agency, the Army G-2 Bureau, the Air Force Intelligence Agency, the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, and the National Security Agency."

The magazine said that on the "spy master's list of spies" in the United States, there are female spies who sell their bodies, as well as "stealthy spies who sneak across borders with small rolls of film hidden in the secret compartments of their handbags." The magazine shamelessly said, "The fact is that the CIA does send 'ghosts' to infiltrate the Iron Curtain (this is a derogatory term used by the United States to refer to the socialist camp - editor's note), and does buy millions of dollars worth of intelligence from agents."

The facts cited in the article show that the US government is completely unscrupulous in spying on the intelligence of various socialist countries, and these methods include "aerial photography," "eavesdropping on phone calls," and "intercepting radio telegrams," etc. The article stated, "Radio, radar, and infrared detection equipment installed by the United States in Turkey, the Aleutian Islands, and on submarines and other ships sent near the Soviet coast are used to detect Soviet missile tests and listen to Soviet radio telegrams."

The magazine pointed out that US military attachés, diplomatic officials, and other official personnel stationed abroad constantly report various situations, from the firing speed of anti-tank guns to the health status of the chief of general staff of a certain socialist country, to American spy organizations as intelligence. For those traitors who "fled" from socialist countries and betrayed their motherland, the US government also sends "highly trained experts" to question them and collect intelligence from socialist countries.

Socialist countries' books, newspapers, and documents are also targets for American intelligence agencies to collect information. The article pointed out that in order to collect intelligence, "tons of Soviet publications, statistics, technical magazines, business publications, speeches, and official reports are checked and rechecked."

However, "Newsweek" said that although the American intelligence work "has spent billions of dollars in investment, adopted the latest electronic equipment, and recruited some of the most talented analysts in the world," it still often "fails." For example, "the CIA did not anticipate the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite," and "in earlier years, American intelligence agencies also underestimated the progress made by the Russians in atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs."

### 美国“新闻周刊”公开透露  美国对社会主义国家大搞特务活动  每年花费三十亿美元豢养间谍十万名之多

    美国“新闻周刊”公开透露
    美国对社会主义国家大搞特务活动
    每年花费三十亿美元豢养间谍十万名之多
    新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：美国以十万名人员、每年三十亿美元的费用从事对社会主义国家的间谍情报活动。
    2月8日一期的美国“新闻周刊”刊载的一篇叙述美国间谍和特务活动的文章，承认了上述事实。这篇文章透露了美国政府派遣间谍潜入社会主义国家以及通过其他形形色色的卑劣手法刺探社会主义国家的政治、军事和经济情报的情况。
    文章说，“美国的全球情报系统目前拥有十多个主要的机构，其中包括中央情报局、海军情报局、陆军G—2局、空军情报局、国务院调查研究处和全国安全署。”
    杂志说，在美国的“间谍头子的间谍名单上”，有着出卖色相的女间谍，也有“在手提包的秘密部分装有小胶卷的偷偷摸摸地潜越国境的间谍”。杂志恬不知耻地说，“事实是，中央情报局确实派遣‘鬼魊’潜入铁幕（这是美国对社会主义阵营的诬蔑性称呼——编者注），并且确实从特务那里购买了价值数百万美元的情报。”
    文章举出的事实表明，在刺探各社会主义国家的情报方面，美国政府是完全不择手段的，这些手段包括“空中摄影”，“偷听电话”和“截听无线电报”等等。文章说，“美国在土耳其、阿留申群岛以及在派到苏联海岸附近的潜水艇和其它船只上装置的无线电、雷达和红外线探测设备就在侦察苏联导弹试验和收听苏联无线电报。”
    杂志指出，美国政府驻在国外的武官、外交官员和其他官方人士不断地将各种情况，从反坦克炮的发射速度到某一社会主义国家的总参谋长的健康状况，作为情报报告给美国的间谍组织。对于那些从社会主义国家“跑”出来的背叛祖国的叛徒，美国政府也派遣“训练有素的专家”去询问他们，搜罗社会主义国家的情报。
    社会主义国家的书报文件也是美国间谍机构收集情报的对象。文章指出，为了收集情报，“数以吨计的苏联出版物、统计、技术杂志、商业刊物、演说和官方报告被查对又查对”。
    但是“新闻周刊”说，尽管美国的情报工作“花了数十亿美元的投资，采用了最新式的电子设备，并且搜罗了世界上最有才干的分析家中的一些”，但是仍然常常“遭到失败”。例如，“苏联发射第一个人造卫星，中央情报局事先就没有预料到”，“在早些年头，美国的情报机构也低估了俄国人在原子弹和氢弹方面取得的进展”。
