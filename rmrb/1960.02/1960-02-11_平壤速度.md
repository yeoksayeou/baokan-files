Pyongyang Speed

"Immortal Bird"

Pyongyang, in the recent decade, has experienced the most severe destruction in Korean history, and also the most unprecedented construction, becoming a heroic city attracting worldwide attention from peace-loving people. During the war, American imperialism dropped 420,000 bombs on this place in three years, clamoring to erase Pyongyang from the map. However, the enemy's bombs could turn the city into ruins and a sea of fire, but they could not stop the Korean people's progress, nor could they destroy the Korean people's confidence in aspiring to a new life. Even when people lived in caves, and enemy planes roared overhead, the Korean Workers' Party and Premier Kim Il-sung led the people to prepare for the post-war reconstruction of Pyongyang. On the first day when American imperialism had to bow its head and sign the armistice agreement, construction labor songs resounded everywhere in Pyongyang. Seven years have passed, and this heroic city, known as the "Immortal Bird," has stubbornly stood up again from the ruins, like a rising sun, illuminating the hearts of the 30 million Korean people.

We, with joy, excitement, and admiration, made a pilgrimage through the bustling sea of buildings on People's Army Street, Stalin Street, Youth Street, and the Ring Road, and also climbed the flower-like Moranbong Peak, touring the picturesque tree-lined banks of the Taedong River. Everything was much better than what we saw in the photos, and better than we imagined. Five- or six-story high residential buildings stood on both sides of the street. Almost every window was adorned with sky-blue and pink curtains, and carefully crafted paper-cut peace doves. Pots of green plants were placed on the small balconies. Cars sped one after another on the wide and clean roads, and the street gardens were planted with various flowers, trees, and plants. Every time night fell, the lights in all the high-rise buildings in Pyongyang lit up, like scattering stars on the earth. The soft light shone through the beautiful curtains in the windows, weaving colorful light curtains on the streets. Milky white street lamps, like strings of sparkling big pearls, hung on Pyongyang's chest. On the Taedong River, the reflection of the city's night view glittered. Seven years is only a moment in historical terms, but the Korean people have built four million square meters of multi-story buildings on a pile of ruins. The city has grown from a population of 420,000 before the war to 940,000, and the living area and tree-lined land per capita in Pyongyang has more than doubled and seven times, respectively, compared to the era of Japanese imperialism.

Laughter Blossoms in Life

There is a song called "Laughter Blossoms in Life" circulating among the people, telling the story of a person who came to Pyongyang after the war to visit his friend. The friend's original dilapidated house was gone, and he had already moved into a new residential building. Let's listen to a section of this song:

"Ah! That's right! Because the American devils bombed and made us homeless, now we suddenly have a magnificent Western-style house, it's like a dream! Ah, that's right! That's right! That's really great! Here are new houses, and there are new houses, in a beautiful life, laughter blossoms." The lyrics are beautiful. However, the real life of Pyongyang people is even better than the lyrics.

The high-rise buildings on Pyongyang's streets have various shops on the ground floor, and the upper floors are the residences of working people. We have found more than once that the windows of the residential buildings upstairs have apple-like small faces, sticking to the glass, smiling and waving to us. These small faces strongly attract us.

One day, we finally visited the home of car driver Song Cheol-geuk in a newly completed five-story residential building. His experience is thought-provoking. The whole family of four lived in caves during the war; after the war, they came out of the caves and moved into a simple temporary residence; now, he has bid farewell to the temporary residence and become one of the owners of this building. On the very day of our visit, he had just moved in. He occupied two spacious and bright rooms in the building, wallpapered with blue printed wallpaper, as well as a private kitchen, bathroom, toilet, and storage room. His wife happily arranged the new home, a four- or five-year-old daughter ran in and out "helping" her mother, and the youngest daughter was already asleep on the warm floor, with a happy smile on her quiet face. Anyone who enters this small family will feel joy and happiness. I don't know if this ordinary working-class family is the master of the song "Laughter Blossoms in Life." However, the laughter in this family's real life, the dreamlike encounter of an ordinary worker in the socialist motherland, is so similar to the lyrics!

During the day, Pyongyang is often bathed in golden sunshine, and there are few pedestrians on the street. By dusk, the street becomes extraordinarily lively. When the lights are lit, we went to the Moranbong Theater. Along the way, we saw many young people with rosy cheeks, laughing in front of the brightly lit theaters and cinemas. When we comfortably sat in the Moranbong Theater and heard the audience laughing at the stage, the smiles of Song Cheol-geuk's family appeared in front of my eyes again. At this time, Comrade Kang Sang-wi of the Korean Journalists Union told me in a low voice: "During the war, our people were also full of confidence in the future and laughed. Right under this theater, there is an underground theater. In those nights of bullet rain and roaring bombs, we held many brilliant parties here!" His words caused me a long period of excitement. The enemy could not take away the laughter of the Korean people with the most brutal methods in the war. Today, Pyongyang people are smiling more proudly and happily than in the past in their new life!

"Chollima" Speed

People call the "Chollima" speed with which Korean comrades built a new city of nearly a million people from ruins in just seven years the "Pyongyang Speed." A Korean friend said to me:

"Comrades know what the enemy did to Pyongyang during the war. Should we live in caves forever because the enemy destroyed it? After the war, we were determined to build our city at the fastest speed in the world so that the people could live in socialist high-rise buildings. As a result, the Party and the Premier led our people to do it."

Yes, the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party and Premier Kim Il-sung personally led this "high-speed" struggle, put forward the policy of "standardized design, industrialized component production, and mechanized construction"; and widely adopted prefabricated methods to build new houses. Under the guidance of the leader, the Korean working class smashed the obstruction of right-leaning conservatives, and with great enthusiasm, they manufactured equipment themselves on a pile of ruins with nothing, produced the first batch of cement prefabricated components, and, without any technology, diligently learned and grew a large number of skilled assemblers. As a result, a revolution was set off in the construction industry. In 1959, 92% of Pyongyang's residences and 60% of public buildings adopted prefabricated construction methods, and a construction speed that is difficult for any capitalist country to imagine appeared.

What kind of speed is "Pyongyang Speed"? Let the spokesperson of capitalism give an objective explanation. A Japanese reporter who had been to Pyongyang in 1957 visited Pyongyang again in 1959. When he got off the train and walked out of Pyongyang Station, he found that the sea of buildings built by the Korean people at high speed made it impossible for him to find the road he had traveled two years ago. This Japanese reporter, who considered himself an "old hand," couldn't help but exclaim: "Lost!"

It is not surprising that he exclaimed like this. Right next to the station, there is a five-story department store that people proudly call "overnight." More than a month before "August 15" in 1958, this place was still a wasteland. Pyongyang construction workers, with creative labor, adopted prefabricated methods and built this 10,000-square-meter building in just forty-seven days. On the eve of "August 15," the doors and windows of the building were still open, and the inside was empty. Workers installed 5,000 square meters of door and window glass, installed electric lights, and displayed 10,000 kinds of goods overnight. This is the origin of "overnight." The next day, when people happily celebrated the "August 15" Liberation Day, this building received tens of thousands of excited and surprised customers like a world in a fairy tale.

In Pyongyang, there is such high speed everywhere. Pyongyang's Youth Street was built in six months. The granite embankment on the Taedong River, the tree-lined avenue paved with concrete, and the beautiful Youth Park under Moranbong Peak were also built in just sixty days. Moreover, the construction speed of Pyongyang continues to accelerate. In 1956, it took 105 days to build 1,000 square meters of houses; in 1958, it only took 14 days; and in 1959, it only took 10 days. Today's Pyongyang can assemble a set of houses with heating and plumbing every eight hours.

The People's Heart

If we say that today's beauty, laughter, and speed is "heroic Pyongyang," it is obviously incomplete. Let us look at the people of Pyongyang through these!

We once visited a cement prefabricated component manufacturing factory in the suburbs of Pyongyang. This is the first factory built by the builders of the Chollima era to produce building components. To be precise, this is just a small warehouse riddled with holes from the war. In 1955, workers came here with the lofty ambition of rebuilding Pyongyang, covered the broken holes with grass bags and tarpaulins, manufactured cranes and all equipment with scrap iron, and used the waste steam from the boilers of the Pyongyang Textile Factory to dry cement components, and began production. Not long ago, a West German reporter wanted to see how Pyongyang's high-rise buildings were produced, so people took him here. He saw that the factory buildings had "skylights" everywhere, the machines were vibrating as if the house was also vibrating, and his excessive sense of security made him worry that the roof would fall, so he quickly fled and didn't even look at the factory. However, listen to the voice of the Korean working class: "Such a factory can scare away the bourgeoisie, but it will never scare us away." Not only will it not scare them away, but more than 100 workers in the factory produced cement prefabricated components in this dilapidated warehouse in four years that could build 200,000 square meters of high-rise residential buildings.

Today, there are not one but seven cement prefabricated component factories in Pyongyang, two of which are produced by large-scale mechanization methods. However, it was the heroes of this old, dilapidated factory who set an example for the mechanization of prefabricated component production and paved the way for the high-speed construction of the democratic capital using prefabricated methods.

Pyongyang builders built today's beautiful and heroic Pyongyang with this valuable enthusiasm and creativity. In 1958, construction workers and technicians, with the pride of being builders of the democratic capital, decided to build 20,000 houses for the capital with the funds and materials for building 13,000 houses. On the premise of ensuring quality, people boldly modified the design, changing the spacing between floors of multi-story residential buildings from three meters to 2.6 meters, changing the thickness of the outer walls of cement components from two bricks thick to one and a half bricks thick, and canceling unnecessary interior decorations, saving a large amount of materials. During the construction process, workers rapidly improved the technical level of assembly operations and mechanization. A crane increased its assembly of components from 145 per day in 1957 to 360. People moved forward in big steps like this, and finally completed 20,850 houses by the end of the year.

Not only construction workers, but all Pyongyang people, the people of northern North Korea, have such a heroic heart, a proud heart. When the first road began to be cleared on the ruins of Pyongyang, the first tap water pipe was laid, and the first park was built, workers, young students, office cadres, and housewives from various factories in Pyongyang became architects. University students from Kaesong, Chongjin, Hamhung, and many other places also came by train; every agricultural cooperative in Ryanggang Province, Jagang Province, and North Hamgyong Province (province is equivalent to our country's province) by the Yalu River also sent a representative. By the end of 1958, people had volunteered 5.4 million workdays for the construction of Pyongyang. In 1959, 30,000 young students in Pyongyang enthusiastically participated in the construction of the Taedong River embankment, Gyeongseonggou Park, and Daeseongsan scenic area in the cold spring rain. Almost every street and every resting place in Pyongyang is filled with the people's love for the capital and shines with the brilliance of socialism.

We talked to many builders in Pyongyang, and they always said excitedly: "We are building the heart of the motherland." During the war, the people defended Pyongyang, the heart of the motherland, with their lives and blood; after the restoration of peace, they built Pyongyang with the sweat of their wisdom and made it shine brightly. Isn't the people's heart easy to understand?

Today and Tomorrow

We praise the beauty and majesty of Pyongyang. Comrade Kim Sang-in, Director of the Pyongyang City Construction Bureau, said: "Comrades have seen the beautiful Stalin Street, but it cannot fully represent Pyongyang today. We are building a large theater with 2,000 seats, a children's palace with 25,000 square meters, a circus with 15,000 square meters, a comprehensive news building with 79,000 square meters, and many modern streets and new residential areas. In a very short time, Stalin Street will become one of Pyongyang's 'old' streets."

Comrade Heo Gwang-il, General Manager of the Jung-gu Construction Company, which is building the Daetunggol residential area, showed us the design blueprint hanging on the wall of his office. The blueprint indicates that this residential area, which can be built in 1960 with 7,800 households, has a green street in the center that is 60 meters wide like a flower bed, and a park on the small hill. The entire residential area has heating and water supply equipment, a comprehensive hospital, a stadium, a children's swimming pool, a cinema, a theater, and many public laundries, primary schools, kindergartens, nurseries... according to the population ratio. On the ground floor of the residential buildings are bookstores, entertainment rooms, post offices, bathhouses, non-staple food stores, department stores, snack bars, barber shops, clothing stores... People can do everything they need within 500 meters of their homes. Comrade Heo Gwang-il said that in the future, all new residential areas in Pyongyang will be built according to this plan.

The design blueprint fully reflects the ideals of socialist urban construction, and we are completely attracted by the beautiful future depicted in this blueprint. Korean comrades like to use the phrase "building a paradise on earth" to describe their socialist construction cause. Isn't this wonderful blueprint a paradise on earth?

    平壤速度
    宋祝平
    “不死之鸟”
    平壤，在最近的十年中，经历了朝鲜历史上从未有过的大破坏，也经历了历史上从未有过的大建设，成为全世界爱好和平的人民注目的英雄城。在战争期间，美帝国主义在三年中向这里投下了四十二万颗炸弹，扬言要把平壤从地图上消灭。但是，敌人的炸弹可以把城市炸成一片废墟、火海，却挡不住朝鲜人民前进的脚步，毁灭不了朝鲜人民向往新生活的信心。就在人民住在地洞里，敌机在头上轰鸣的年月，朝鲜劳动党和金日成首相就领导人民进行着战后重建平壤的准备。当美帝国主义不得不低下头来在停战协定上签字的第一天，平壤便到处响起了建设的劳动歌声。七年过去了，这个被称为“不死之鸟”的英雄城市，又从废墟上顽强地站立起来，像初升的太阳，照亮了朝鲜三千万人民的心。
    我们怀着欢喜、激动和敬佩的心情，到人民军大街、斯大林大街、青年大街、环城马路的繁华楼海中作了一次巡礼，也登上花朵一样的牡丹峰，游览风景如画的大同江岸林荫道。一切都比我们从照片上看到的，比我们想像的要美好得多。大街两旁矗立着五、六层的高楼住宅，几乎每家的窗户上都挂着天蓝色、粉红色的窗帘，贴着精心制作的和平鸽窗花，小阳台上摆着一盆一盆绿色的植物。汽车在宽阔清洁的马路上一辆接着一辆地奔驰，街心花园中栽满了各种花草树木。每当夜幕初临，平壤所有高楼里的电灯都亮了，就像在大地上撒下满天星斗。那柔和的灯光通过窗口美丽的窗帘闪射出来，在大街上织成了五彩缤纷的光幕。乳白色的街灯，像一串一串晶莹的大珍珠，挂在平壤的胸前。在大同江上，城市夜景的倒影闪闪发光。七年的时间，用历史的眼光来看只是一刹那，朝鲜人民却在一片废墟上建筑了四百万平方米的多层大楼。城市由战前的四十二万人口发展到九十四万，而每个平壤人的居住面积和林荫地，却比日本帝国主义统治时代增加了一倍多和七倍。
    欢笑在生活中开了花
    有一首叫作“欢笑在生活中开了花”的歌曲，在人们中间流传着，讲的是一个人战后来到平壤探望他的朋友，朋友原来住的破房子没有了，已经住进新的住宅大楼中。就听听这首歌的一段吧：
    “呵！对了！因为美国鬼子轰炸弄得无家可归，现在忽然有了华丽的洋房子，真像梦一样呵！呵，不错！不错！真不错！这里是新房屋，那里也是新房屋，在美丽的生活中，欢笑开了花。”歌词是美丽的。但是，平壤人的现实生活比歌词更美好。
    平壤大街上的高楼，底层是各种商店，上面就是劳动人民的住宅。我们不止一次地发现，那些楼上住宅的窗户，有一张一张苹果般的小脸，贴在玻璃上，在欢笑地望着我们，在向我们打招呼。这些小脸强烈地吸引着我们。
    有一天，我们终于在一座新落成的五层住宅大楼里，访问了汽车司机宋哲极的家。他的经历是耐人寻味的。全家四口人，战争中，住在地洞里；战后，从地洞里出来，搬进了简陋的临时住宅；现在，他又和临时住宅告别了，成了这座大楼的主人之一。就在我们访问的这一天，他刚刚搬进来。他在大楼上占了两间用蓝色印花墙纸表糊过的宽敞明亮的房子，还有自用的厨房、洗澡间、厕所、贮藏室。他的妻子欢笑着布置新居，一个四、五岁的女儿跑出跑进给母亲“帮忙”，最小的女儿已经睡在暖炕上了，安静的脸上还挂着幸福的微笑。任何一个人走进这个小家庭都会感到欢乐幸福。我不知道，这一个普普通通的工人家庭，是不是就是“欢笑在生活中开了花”那首歌中的主人。但是，这个家庭现实生活中的欢笑，这一个普通工人在社会主义祖国梦境一样的遭遇，又和歌词多么相像呵！
    白天，平壤经常披着金色的阳光，街上的行人很少。一到黄昏，街上却变的热闹非凡。华灯初上，我们到牡丹峰剧场去。一路上，我们看到不少脸蛋冻的通红的青年人，在灯火辉煌的剧场、电影院门口欢笑着。当我们舒适地坐在牡丹峰剧场，听到观众对着舞台发出笑声，我的眼前便又出现了宋哲极一家的笑容。这时，朝鲜记者同盟的姜尚渭同志低低地告诉我：“在战争中，我们的人民也充满着对于明天的信心，也在欢笑。就在这座剧场下面，有一座地下剧场，在那弹雨轰鸣的夜晚，我们在这里举行过多少次灯火辉煌的晚会！”他的话引起我长时间的激动。敌人在战争中用最残暴的方法也夺不走朝鲜人民的欢笑。今天，平壤人在新生活中比过去笑的更是多么自豪、多么好！
    “千里马”速度
    人们把朝鲜同志只用七年时间从废墟上建立了近百万人口的新城市的“千里马”速度，叫作“平壤速度”。一位朝鲜朋友对我说：
  “在战争中，敌人把平壤破坏成什么样子，同志们是知道的。难道因为敌人破坏，我们就永远住地洞吗？战后，我们决心用世界上最快的速度建设我们的城市，让人民住到社会主义的高楼大厦中去。结果，党和首相领导着我们的人民做到了。”
    是的，朝鲜劳动党中央和金日成首相亲自领导了这一场“高速度”的斗争，提出了“设计标准化，构件生产工业化，施工机械化”的方针；广泛地采用装配式方法建筑新的房子。朝鲜工人阶级在领袖的指引下，粉碎了右倾保守分子的阻挠，怀着极大热情，在一无所有的废墟上，自己制造设备，生产出第一批水泥预制构件，并且在毫无技术的情况下，勤学苦练，成长了大批的熟练的装配工，结果，在建筑业中掀起了一个革命。1959年，平壤92％的住宅，60％的公共建筑物采用了装配式建筑方法，出现了任何一个资本主义国家所难以想像的建设速度。
    “平壤速度”是怎样的速度，还是让资本主义的代言人来作一番客观的说明吧。1957年曾经到过平壤的一个日本记者，1959年又来平壤访问。当他下了火车，走出平壤车站，就发现朝鲜人民用高速度建设起来的楼海，使他再也找不见两年前曾经走过的道路。这位自认为是“识途老马”的日本记者不禁惊呼：“迷路了！”
    他发出这样的惊呼一点也不奇怪。就在车站的旁边，有一座被人们骄傲地称作是“一夜之间”出现的五层百货大楼。1958年“八·一五”之前一个多月，这里还是一片荒场，平壤的建筑工人以创造性的劳动，采用了装配式的方法，仅仅用了四十七天，就把这座面积一万平方米的大楼盖成了。在“八·一五”前夕，大楼的门窗还是敞开着，里面空无一物，工人们在一夜之间，镶好了五千平方米的门窗玻璃，安装了电灯，陈列了一万种商品。这就是“一夜之间”的由来。第二天，当人们欢度“八·一五”解放纪念日的时候，这座大楼就像童话中的世界一样接待了数以万计的兴奋、惊讶的顾客。
    在平壤，到处有这样的高速度。平壤的青年大街，是用六个月的时间建成的。大同江岸花岗岩的堤岸、混凝土铺成的林荫大道，牡丹峰下美丽的青年公园，也只用了六十天就建设起来了。而且，平壤的建设速度继续不断地加快。1956年建筑一千平方米住宅，要一百零五天；1958年只要十四天；1959年就只要十天。今天的平壤，每八小时就可以装配一套有水暖设备的住宅。
    人民的心
    如果说，今天的美丽、欢笑、速度就是“英雄的平壤”，显然是不完整的。让我们透过这些，来看一看平壤的人民吧！
    我们曾经访问平壤郊区的一个水泥预制构件制造工厂。这是千里马时代的建设者们建设起来的第一个生产房屋构件的工厂。确切地说，这只是一座战争中被炸的千疮百孔的小仓库。1955年，工人们怀着重建平壤的雄心大志来到这里，用草袋、篷布遮起破洞，用废铁制造了起重机和一切设备，利用平壤纺织厂锅炉中的废汽烘干水泥构件，开始了生产。不久以前，一个西德的记者想要看看平壤的高楼是怎样产生的，人们便把他领到这儿。他看见厂房到处开着“天窗”，机器震动着似乎屋子也在震动，过份的安全感使他担心屋顶会掉下来，他连忙逃走，工厂也不看了。可是，再听听朝鲜工人阶级的声音：“这样的厂房可以吓退资产阶级，却永远吓不退我们。”岂止吓不退，全厂一百多个工人，在四年中就在这座破仓库里生产了能够建筑二十万平方米高楼住宅的水泥预制构件。
    今天，平壤的水泥预制构件工厂不是一个而是七个了，其中两个是用大规模的机械化的方法生产的。但是，就是这个千疮百孔的旧工厂的英雄们，树立了预制构件生产机械化的榜样，铺平了采用装配式方法高速度建设民主首都的道路。
    平壤建设者们以这种可贵的热情和创造精神，建设了今天美丽的、英雄的平壤。1958年，建筑工人、技术人员，怀着作为民主首都建设者的自豪，决心用建筑一万三千户住宅的资金、材料，为首都建设两万户住宅。人们在保证质量的前提下，大胆地修改了设计，把多层住宅一层与一层之间的间隔，由三米改为二点六米，把水泥构件的外墙厚度由两个砖那么厚改为一个半砖厚，取消了室内不必要的装饰，节约了大批材料。在施工过程中，工人们飞快地提高着装配作业和机械化的技术水平，一台起重机由1957年一天装配一百四十五个构件提高到三百六十个。人们就是这样大步前进，年底，终于建成了二万零八百五十户住宅。
    不仅是建筑工人，而是所有的平壤人，北朝鲜北部的人民，都有一颗这样英雄的心，骄傲的心。当平壤的废墟上开始清理第一条马路，铺设第一根自来水管，建设第一座公园的时候，平壤各工厂的工人、青年学生、机关干部、家庭妇女都成了建筑师。开城、清津、咸兴，许多地方的大学生，也坐着火车赶来了；鸭绿江边的两江道、慈江道和咸镜北道（道相当于我国的省）的每一个农业社，也都派了一个代表赶来了。到1958年底，人们为建设平壤义务劳动了五百四十万工日。1959年，平壤的三万青年学生，在春寒冷雨中，又热情地参加了大同江堤岸、庆尚沟公园、大城山游览地的修建。几乎平壤的每一条街、每一个休憩地，都洋溢着人民对于首都的爱情，闪耀着社会主义的光采。
    我们同平壤的许多建设者谈过话，他们总是兴奋地说：“我们建设的是祖国的心脏。”战争中，人民用生命和鲜血保卫了祖国的心脏平壤；和平恢复了，他们又用智慧的汗水把平壤建设得光采焕发。人民的心，这不是很容易理解吗？
    今天和明天
    我们赞美平壤的美丽、雄伟。平壤市建设总局局长金相仁同志却说：“同志们看过了美丽的斯大林大街，但是，它已经不能充分代表平壤的今天。我们正在建设一座有两千座位的大剧场、二万五千平方米的儿童宫、一万五千平方米的马戏院、七万九千平方米的综合新闻大楼，还要建设许多现代化的大街、新住宅区。再过一个很短的时间，斯大林大街就要成为平壤‘古老’的大街之一。”
    正在建设大驼岭住宅区的中区建筑公司总经理许光日同志让我们看挂在他的办公室墙上的设计蓝图，图上标示着，这个1960年可以建成的七千八百户的住宅区，中心有一条六十米宽的像花坛一样的绿色大街，小山上是一座公园。整个住宅区有暖气和供水设备、综合性医院、体育场、儿童游泳池、电影院、剧场，按人口比例，设置许多公共洗衣房、小学校、幼儿园、托儿所……。在住宅大楼的底层，是书店、娱乐室、邮局、澡堂、副食品商店、百货公司、小吃部、理发店、服装店……。人们只要走出家门五百米，就可以办到所需要的一切。许光日同志说，今后，平壤所有的新住宅区，都要按照这样的规划建设。
    设计蓝图充分地体现了社会主义城市建设的理想，我们完全被这幅蓝图所描绘的美丽的未来所吸引了。朝鲜同志喜欢用“建设人间天堂”这样的话来形容自己所进行的社会主义建设事业。这奇妙的蓝图，不就是人间天堂吗？
