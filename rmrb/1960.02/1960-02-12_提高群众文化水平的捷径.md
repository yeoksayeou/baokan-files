A Shortcut to Improving the Cultural Level of the Masses
Wang Zhongqing, Vice Governor of Shanxi Province

The CPC Central Committee and the State Council stated in their "Notice on Continuing to Eliminate Illiteracy and Consolidating the Development of Spare-time Education in Rural Areas": "In ordinary Putonghua areas across the country, the method of using the Latin alphabet to annotate Chinese characters can be tried to help eliminate illiteracy." However, some people only pay attention to using the pinyin alphabet as a tool to promote Putonghua, and neglect the role of using the pinyin alphabet to help eliminate illiteracy. The Jinan Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office resolutely implemented the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, and conducted pilot projects in Wanrong County, which have now achieved successful experience.

The experience of Wanrong County vividly and powerfully proves that phonetic literacy is a good way to eliminate illiteracy in a fast, economical, and effective way, consolidate and expand the results of literacy, and rapidly improve the cultural and scientific level of the broad masses of workers and peasants. Specifically, its advantages are: using the pinyin alphabet to eliminate illiteracy is much faster than not using the pinyin alphabet. The general progress of phonetic literacy is: it takes 15 to 20 hours to learn the entire pinyin alphabet, and then about 100 hours to recognize 1,500 Chinese characters to meet the literacy standard. Moreover, it should be particularly emphasized that after the workers and peasants have mastered the pinyin alphabet as a tool and reached the literacy standard, they can read a large number of phonetic publications and practice writing without being restricted by the number of characters they know. This can not only consolidate the results of literacy, prevent the recurrence of illiteracy, and get rid of the state of illiteracy forever; but also continue to expand the amount of Chinese characters they know, and rapidly improve their reading and writing skills, thereby rapidly improving their political theory and cultural and scientific knowledge level. This kind of achievement will be immediately reflected in the enthusiasm and consciousness of labor, and in the development of scientific and technological research and technical innovation movements. Spare-time education serving production is so rapid, direct, obvious and prominent. The actual situation in Wanrong County fully and powerfully provides us with a typical example.

Some people once believed that using the pinyin alphabet to help eliminate illiteracy would delay the progress of literacy; some people worried that using the pinyin alphabet to eliminate illiteracy would lead to the inability to get rid of the pinyin alphabet "crutches" after literacy, and feared that the pinyin alphabet would replace Chinese characters; others believed that literacy in Shanxi Province was nearing completion, and there was no need to do anything extra. These concerns and arguments once affected the active promotion of phonetic literacy throughout Shanxi Province, which is a lesson we should deeply remember. The brilliant achievements of Wanrong County loudly answered these questions. The progress of literacy has not been delayed, but greatly accelerated. We do not advocate abandoning the pinyin alphabet after literacy; facts have proved that not abandoning it is not harmful to mastering Chinese characters, but beneficial, because the pinyin alphabet is a powerful tool for continuing to improve the masses' political theory level and cultural and scientific knowledge level. The purpose of phonetic literacy is still to recognize Chinese characters, and it is by no means to replace Chinese characters with the pinyin alphabet. It is not unnecessary to use the pinyin alphabet to eliminate illiteracy in Shanxi Province, but very necessary.

The experience of Wanrong County has also given us such an enlightenment: that is, using the pinyin alphabet to eliminate illiteracy, consolidate the results of literacy, actively carry out the movement of reading phonetic publications, and closely combine classroom teaching with the mass self-study movement will definitely accelerate the process of intellectualizing workers and peasants, and the schooling system and curriculum of worker-peasant spare-time red and expert education must also be re-studied and re-stipulated. If the children in the big class of kindergarten learn the pinyin alphabet and recognize a certain number of Chinese characters, the quality of primary school education will definitely be improved, and the years of primary school education will definitely be shortened. The experience of Wanrong County is an experience of overcoming the difficulty of recognizing Chinese characters. Once the difficulty of recognizing characters is broken, the intellectualization of workers and peasants will find a shortcut, and workers and peasants can show their talents in the technological revolution and cultural revolution with great ease. This should be affirmed first; primary school education will also undergo great changes, which should also be affirmed. Solving the problem of the difficulty of recognizing Chinese characters is an important problem that our party has long wanted to solve. Now Wanrong County has provided good experience in solving this problem. Is it not very reasonable for us to attach great importance to this experience?

    提高群众文化水平的捷径
    山西省副省长　王中青
    中共中央、国务院早在“关于在农村继续扫除文盲和巩固发展业余教育的通知”中说：“在全国普通话地区，可以试行用拉丁化拼音字母给汉字注音的办法帮助扫盲。”可是有些人只注意了利用拼音字母作为推广普通话的工具，而忽视了利用拼音字母帮助扫盲的作用。晋南地委和专署坚决执行了中共中央、国务院的指示，在万荣县作试点，现已取得了成功的经验。
    万荣县的经验，生动有力地证明了注音扫盲是一个多快好省地扫除文盲、巩固与扩大扫盲成果、迅速提高广大工农群众文化科学水平的好办法。具体地说，它的好处是：利用拼音字母扫盲比不利用拼音字母扫盲速度快得多，注音扫盲一般的进度是：用十五至二十个小时，就能学会全部拼音字母，再用大约一百个小时，就能认识一千五百个汉字，达到扫盲标准。而且应该特别强调指出的是：工农群众在掌握了拼音字母这个工具达到了扫盲标准之后，就可以不受识字数目的限制，大量阅读注音读物，练习写作。这不仅可以巩固扫盲成果，不至于再发生复盲现象，永远摆脱文盲状态；而且可以继续扩大汉字的识字量，迅速地提高阅读和写作能力，从而迅速地提高他们的政治理论和文化科学知识水平。这种成果便会立竿见影地从劳动的积极性、自觉性中，从开展科学技术的研究工作和技术革新运动中表现出来。业余教育为生产服务表现得如此迅速、直接，如此显明而突出，万荣县的实际情况充分而有力地给我们提供了一个典型范例。
    曾经有些人认为利用拼音字母帮助扫盲会推迟扫盲进度；有些人耽心利用拼音字母扫盲，怕扫盲后丢不掉拼音字母这个“拐棍”，怕以拼音字母代替了汉字；还有的人认为山西省的扫盲已接近尾声，用不着再多此一举了。这些顾虑和论调曾经使山西省在全省范围内积极推行注音扫盲受到了影响，这是我们应当深刻记取的教训。万荣县的辉煌成就，响亮地解答了这些问题。扫盲进度不是推迟了，而是大大加快了。我们不主张扫盲后丢掉拼音字母；事实证明：不丢对于掌握汉字并无坏处，而有好处，因为拼音字母是继续提高群众政治理论水平、文化科学知识水平的有力工具。注音扫盲目的仍在认识汉字，决不是用拼音字母来代替汉字。利用拼音字母扫盲在山西省说来不是没有必要，而是十分必要。
    万荣县的经验还给了我们这样一个启示：就是利用拼音字母扫盲、巩固扫盲成果、积极开展阅读注音读物运动，把课堂教学与群众自学运动密切结合起来，一定会加速工农群众知识化的进程，工农业余红专教育的学制课程也必须重新研究，重新规定。如果使幼儿园的大班儿童学会拼音字母，认识一定数量的汉字，小学教育的质量一定会提高，小学教育的年限一定会缩短。万荣县的经验，是克服汉字难识的经验，识字的难关打破了，打开了，工农群众知识化便找到了捷径，工农群众便可以在技术革命、文化革命中如虎生翅地大显身手，这是首先应该肯定的；小学教育也会发生很大变化，这也是应该肯定的。解决汉字难识的问题，这是我党长期以来想解决的一个重要问题，现在万荣县在解决这个问题上，提供了良好的经验，我们十分重视这个经验不是很有道理的吗？
