Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, 31st - The Second Pan-African People's Conference passed a resolution on economic development, calling on all independent African countries to strive to develop their economies and get rid of economic dependence on imperialist countries.
    The resolution stated that, in view of the backward state of Africa caused by the colonial system and foreign rule; in view of the attempt by colonialist countries to replace political rule with economic rule, thereby depriving newly independent African countries of the essence of independence; in view of the fact that economic development is the most reliable guarantee of the freedom of the African continent; in view of the fact that foreign countries often use their economic assistance as a means of dividing the various regions of Africa and isolating independent countries from those still under colonial rule, the resolution recommends that all independent African countries step up their efforts to free their own countries from economic dependence on imperialist countries, refuse to undertake any obligations to foreign countries that may directly or indirectly be detrimental to the African liberation movement and unity, develop cooperative systems and use the main resources in their regions to benefit the masses of the people in order to ensure social justice and improve their living standards, promote industrialization, devote themselves to land reform and modernize agriculture in order to make Africa economically independent.

    全非人民大会通过经济发展问题决议
    摆脱殖民制度　发展独立经济
    反对帝国主义国家以经济统治来剥夺非洲独立
    据新华社突尼斯31日电　第二届全非人民大会通过关于经济发展问题的决议，呼吁非洲所有独立国家努力发展经济，摆脱在经济上依赖帝国主义国家的状态。
    决议说，鉴于殖民制度和外国统治所造成的非洲的落后状态；鉴于殖民主义国家企图以经济统治来代替政治统治、从而剥夺新独立的非洲国家的独立实质，鉴于经济发展是非洲大陆的自由的最可靠的保证，鉴于外国往往利用它们的经济援助作为分化非洲各地区和使独立国家同那些仍处于殖民统治下的地区隔离开来的手段，决议建议一切独立的非洲国家加紧努力，来使它们自己的国家摆脱在经济上依赖帝国主义国家的状态，拒绝对外国承担任何可能直接或间接不利于非洲解放运动和团结的义务，发展合作制度和利用它们地区内的主要资源为人民群众谋福利以保证社会正义和提高他们的生活水平，促进工业化，致力于土地改革并使农业现代化以便使非洲的经济独立。
