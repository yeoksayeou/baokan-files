Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 15th, Reporter He Changhua reports: Since the Spring Festival, a new upsurge of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has emerged on Shanghai's industrial front, promoting the continued and comprehensive leap forward in production. The current situation is very good, just as the workers described: "Spring has come early this year, and the innovation movement is rising to a climax."

Many factories have reported daily completion of plans and comprehensive completion of plans. In early February, the city's total industrial output value increased by 14% compared to early January. The output of twenty-nine major products, including pig iron, electricity, steam turbines, power station boilers, heavy machinery, automobile tires, paper, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth, also increased compared to early January. The quality of many industries has also been further improved, and costs have been reduced again. Among the city's forty-three cotton spinning mills, thirty-nine mills achieved a 100% standard product rate for cotton yarn in early February. The Second Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 used more than 150 kilograms less pig iron per ton of steel smelted than last month, saving 1,200 tons of pig iron in ten days. Shanghai Silicon Steel Sheet Factory completed twelve days' worth of work in nine days, and the quality reached 99.99%. Shanghai Balance Instrument Factory not only produces products every day, but 80% of the workers have overfulfilled their output and quality quotas, and have independently designed and trial-produced a new product - a first-class analytical balance.

The nineteen technical innovation exhibitions held by the city and districts attract tens of thousands of people every day, becoming important places to introduce, learn, and exchange advanced experiences, and schools for promoting communist style. The broad masses have an urgent demand for technical innovation and a high level of enthusiasm. All walks of life are proceeding from their own conditions and needs, so the content of technical innovation is rich and colorful. Many factories are enthusiastically engaged in mechanization and semi-automation, improving processes, improving technology, and increasing labor productivity. Many factories are seizing the opportunity to save coal, electricity, wood, and other raw materials, carrying out comprehensive utilization to make more products with fewer raw materials; and, they are striving to develop towards high-level precision, striving to reach advanced levels. The Shanghai Bicycle Factory's employees have set themselves the requirements of the highest output, best quality, most varieties, and lowest cost in the national industry. Since the Spring Festival, they have been focusing on the weak links in metal processing, and finally, on the basis of last month's complete success, they have won daily successes after the festival, producing an average of 1,600 bicycles every day, 100 more than the average daily output last month. In addition, they have also successfully trial-produced a special type of bicycle suitable for rural use, which can carry heavy loads, climb hills, and is equipped with protective devices such as safety rods, and has a beautiful appearance, which will be put into production at the end of the month.

The upsurge of technical innovation has promoted the rapid change of the technical face of large and small factories, and the trend of comprehensive technical transformation of the entire enterprise and the entire industry has begun to emerge. This is a new feature. Since the Pioneer Glove Factory modified the old-fashioned hand-cranked glove machine from more than 40 years ago, turning heavy physical labor into electrification, the entire city's knitted glove industry immediately promoted it universally. So far, all 1,640 hand-cranked glove machines weaving white yarn gloves in the industry have been basically electrified; and about 80% of the more than 500 hand-cranked machines weaving fancy gloves have also achieved electric operation. The labor intensity of workers throughout the industry has been greatly reduced, and labor productivity has generally increased by about one time. Xuhui District is currently also focusing on "industry transformation" and "experience matching." Factories in the district's handkerchief and spinning industries have joined forces and are working hard to carry out technical transformation of the entire industry. The district's advanced experience in mold-making by fitters is also being collected, matched, and prepared to be promoted to all fitters. Some factories with conditions have begun to develop from manual operation mechanization to reforming and reorganizing individual machine equipment, adding transmission belts and other devices, to become a group of semi-automatic continuous production machine groups - semi-automatic assembly lines. The results of vigorously promoting mechanization and semi-automation prove that technical innovation not only provides timely help to small and medium-sized enterprises with relatively backward equipment, but also adds glory to some large enterprises with better equipment.

Using technical innovation to save raw materials has also attracted the attention of all walks of life. Recently, a city-wide mobilization meeting for saving coal, electricity, and wood was held. The meeting summarized past achievements and experiences, rewarded advanced units, and put forward the city's saving targets for the first quarter. A new upsurge in seeking raw materials from technical innovation is forming.

The rapid development of the current city's technical innovation movement is due to further mobilizing the masses and mobilizing the revolutionary consciousness of the masses. In many factories, the vast majority of employees participate in innovation, and everyone uses their brains and hands. According to the analysis of the Xuhui District Committee of the Communist Party of China, among the district's 210 factories, nearly 100% of the masses in more than 20 factories participated in the technical innovation movement, and the masses participating in more than 100 factories accounted for 60% to 80%, and only a dozen factories had poor mobilization of the masses. With the revolutionary consciousness of the masses, innovation has become a pleasant undertaking, and the scene is very moving. Many people are pondering the principles of their own innovation and creation from children's toys and daily things that are not noticed, and even when eating, walking, and sleeping, they never forget innovation. With the spirit of "poor sticks," they actively use various waste materials and use a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to realize their innovation and creation. The communist style of people daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act is rising more and more. After the Shanghai No. 1 Pharmaceutical Factory underwent bold assumptions and collective efforts by worker Yin Zuobin, a "no-man workshop" recently emerged, with an efficiency one time higher than the original manual operation. In this no-man workshop, production is automatically controlled by instruments, etc., and workers only need to add materials once every three days. Once the equipment malfunctions, the semiconductor photocell will automatically alarm, and only needs to be adjusted or repaired upon hearing the sound. In many factories, not only technical workers enthusiastically participate in the innovation movement, but even young apprentices, unskilled auxiliary workers, and female workers who were housewives a few years ago have broken down superstitions and come up with many innovations.

Continuously improving the leadership's ideology and leadership style is an important reason for mobilizing the enthusiasm of the staff and workers and promoting the development of the technical innovation movement. Leading cadres in many factories go down to participate in labor, plant "experimental fields," stand among the masses to discover and encourage advanced seedlings, support the creation of the masses, or bring technical personnel to the masses to engage in innovation with the masses and solve key problems. They go to the masses to liberate the thinking of the masses, and at the same time liberate their own thinking.

    英雄儿女风格高　千方百计大协作　敢想敢干争上游
    上海掀起全行业全面技术革新运动
    工业生产继续全面跃进，二月上旬总产值比一月上旬增长14％
    新华社上海15日电　记者贺昌华报道：春节以来，上海工业战线上的技术革新和技术革命运动出现新的高潮，促进生产继续全面地跃进。当前的形势很好，恰如工人所形容的：“今年春来早，革新起高潮。”
    许多工厂传出了天天完成计划、全面完成计划的捷报。2月上旬，全市工业总产值比1月上旬增长了14％。生铁、电力、汽轮机、电站锅炉、重型机械、汽车外胎、纸张纸版、棉纱、棉布等二十九种主要产品的产量，比1月上旬也都有提高。不少行业质量也有进一步提高，成本再度降低。全市四十三个棉纺厂中，有三十九个厂上旬的棉纱标准品率达到了100％。上钢一厂第二转炉车间每炼一吨钢所用的生铁比上月减少一百五十多公斤，十天就节约了一千二百吨生铁。上海矽钢片厂九天完成十二天工作量，而且质量达到99．99％。上海天平仪器厂不仅天天出产品，有80％的工人都超额完成产量和质量定额，并且自行设计和试制成功了新产品——一等分析天平。
    市、区举办的十九个技术革新展览会，每天都吸引着数以万计的人群，成为介绍、学习和交流先进经验的重要场所，发扬共产主义风格的学校。广大群众对技术革新的要求迫切，热情很高。各行各业都从自己的条件和需要出发，因而技术革新内容丰富多采，万紫千红。许多工厂热烈地搞机械化、半自动化，改进工艺，改进技术，提高劳动生产率。很多工厂抓紧节约煤、电、木材及其他原料材料，开展综合利用，以更少的原料做更多的产品；并且，努力向高级精密方向发展，力求达到先进水平。上海自行车厂的职工给自己提出了全国同行业中产量最高、质量最好、品种最多、成本最低的要求，春节以来围攻金属加工薄弱环节，终于在上月满堂红的基础上又夺得了节后日日红，每天都均衡地生产一千六百辆自行车，比上月平均日产量多一百辆。此外，他们还试制成功一种特别适宜农村用的自行车，能载重，能爬坡，车上装有保险梗等防护装置，外形美观，月底即可投入生产。
    技术革新高潮促使大小工厂技术面貌日新月异，并且开始出现整个企业、整个行业全面技术改造的潮流。这是一个新的特点。自从先锋手套厂把四十多年前的老式手摇手套机加以改装，变繁重的体力劳动为电动化以后，全市针织手套行业立即普遍推广。到目前为止，全行业一千六百四十台织白纱手套的手摇手套机，已经基本上全部实现电动化；五百多台织花式手套的手摇机，也有80％左右实现电动化操作。整个行业工人劳动强度大大减轻，劳动生产率一般提高一倍左右。徐汇区目前也在抓“行业翻身”和“经验配套”。这个区的手帕、纺线两个行业的工厂合成一股劲，正在努力进行全行业的技术改造。全区钳工开模子方面的先进经验也正在集中起来，配成套，准备向全体钳工推广。一部分有条件的工厂，已开始从手工操作机械化发展到把单个机器设备加以改革改组，增加传动带等装置，成为一组半自动化连续生产的机器群——半自动化流水生产线。大搞机械化半自动化的成果证明，技术革新既为一般设备比较落后的中小型企业雪里送炭，也为一些设备比较好的大型企业锦上添花。
    用大搞技术革新的方法来节约原料材料，也已引起各行各业的重视。最近，举行了全市节约煤、电、木材的动员大会。会议总结了过去的成绩和经验，奖励了先进单位，并且提出了第一季度全市的节约指标。一个向技术革新要原料材料的新热潮正在形成。
    当前全市技术革新运动发展如此迅速，是由于进一步发动了群众，调动了群众的革命自觉。许多工厂都是绝大多数职工参加革新，大家动脑动手。据中共徐汇区委员会分析，全区二百十多个工厂中，有二十几个工厂几乎是100％的群众参加了技术革新运动，有一百多个工厂参加的群众占60％到80％，发动群众较差的只有十几个工厂。群众有了革命自觉，搞革新就成了一种愉快的事业，场面很动人。很多人从小孩的玩具、日常不大为人注意的事物中，琢磨自己革新创造的原理，即使吃饭、走路、睡觉，也念念不忘革新。他们以“穷棒子”的精神，积极利用各种废旧材料，用土洋结合的办法来实现自己的革新创造。人们敢想、敢说、敢作的共产主义风格越来越高涨。上海第一制药厂经过工人殷作斌大胆设想，集体努力，最近出现了一个“无人工段”，效率比原来手工操作提高一倍。在这个无人工段里，生产由仪表等自动控制，工人只要每隔三天去加一次料就行了。一旦设备发生故障，半导体光电管会自动报警，只要闻声进行调整或修理就行。在许多工厂里，不仅有技术的工人热烈参加革新运动，连年轻的艺徒、没有技术的辅助工、几年前还是家庭妇女的女工，也纷纷破除迷信，搞出了很多革新。
    不断改进领导思想、领导作风，是调动职工群众积极性，促进技术革新运动向前发展的重要原因。很多工厂的领导干部都下去参加劳动，种“试验田”，站到群众中去发现和鼓励先进的萌芽，支持群众的创造，或者带了技术人员，到群众中去跟群众一道搞革新，解决关键问题。他们到群众中去解放群众的思想，同时也解放了自己的思想。
