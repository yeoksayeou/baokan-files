Small Information

    Hydro Power Station
    Wherever there are rivers and ditches, hydropower stations can be built using the water's drop. The hydropower station is equipped with a water turbine. The water turbine rotates by the impact of water power, and then the water turbine drives processing machinery such as flour mills, grain threshers, and rice mills to realize the mechanization of agricultural product processing. If the power of the water turbine is used to drive a generator, the hydropower station can be turned into a hydroelectric power station, which can drive more processing machinery and solve rural lighting problems.
    Since the hydropower station uses water power as its power source, the cost of building the station is low and the equipment is simple. There are conditions for building stations in mountainous areas, semi-mountainous areas, and dam areas with abundant water sources.

    水力站
    凡是有河流、沟渠的地方，都可以利用水的落差建立水力站。水力站装上水轮机，通过水力的冲击转动水轮机，再用水轮机带动磨面机、谷麦脱粒机、碾米机等加工机械，实现农产品加工机械化；若用水轮机的动力带动发电机，就可以使水力站变成水电站，可以带动更多的加工机械，并能解决农村照明问题。
    由于水力站是利用水力作为动力，建站的成本低，设备简单，凡是在水源丰富的山区、半山区、坝区都有条件建站。
