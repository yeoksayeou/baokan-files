Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 21st -- North Korea's "Pyongyang News" commented today on U.S. President Eisenhower's upcoming "visit" to Latin America, saying that recently Eisenhower has been talking grandly about "non-interference" in these countries' "internal affairs" and "friendship" towards them. But no matter how much the wolf is clothed in sheep's skin, it is still a wolf.

The commentary condemned the series of provocative activities recently carried out by U.S. imperialism in Latin America -- continuing to use U.S. planes to bomb Cuba, sending U.S. Marines to land in the Dominican Republic, and conducting intimidating naval exercises in the Caribbean Sea.

The commentary mentioned that sixty-six political parties and public organizations in Cuba and other Latin American countries have issued a joint statement, calling for the holding of "Week of Support for the Latin American People" starting on March 20th. The statement warned Eisenhower to pay attention to Nixon's experience in the region not long ago.

Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd -- Newspapers in the German Democratic Republic and Poland have published commentaries on U.S. President Eisenhower's trip to South America.

The German Democratic Republic's "Neues Deutschland" published an article saying that the alliance between the United States and South American countries is disintegrating. U.S. Vice President Nixon's visit to South America two years ago did nothing to improve relations with South American countries. Since then, anti-American sentiment in Bolivia, Panama, Venezuela, and Cuba has greatly increased. At a recent United Nations meeting, eight Latin American countries voted against the United States in the election of non-permanent members of the Security Council.

The article pointed out that it is clear that Latin American countries are disgusted with U.S. supervision and exploitation. Eisenhower's purpose in visiting South America this time is to try to prevent the development of this tendency in Latin America in the United Nations and to save the U.S. market in South America. However, the people of Latin American countries are unlikely to be deceived by empty U.S. promises.

Poland's "Voice of Labor" pointed out that the purpose of the U.S. President's visit is to hope to strengthen the suppressors of the progressive movement in Latin America -- the "Organization of American States" -- and to hope that Latin American countries will continue to support the United States in the United Nations organization. The newspaper said that because Latin American countries are paying more attention to their own national interests. The newspaper said that times have changed, and it is doubtful whether this visit by the U.S. President to countries of "dissatisfaction" can bring concrete achievements to the United States.

    朝德波报纸评美国总统的南美之行
    拉丁美洲人民反美情绪不可遏阻
    艾森豪威尔的空洞诺言骗不了人
    新华社平壤21日电　朝鲜“平壤新闻”今天在评论美国总统艾森豪威尔将到拉丁美洲“访问”时说，最近艾森豪威尔高谈“不干涉”这些国家的“内政”，和对它们的“友谊”。但是不管怎样披上羊皮，狼总归是狼。
    评论谴责美帝国主义最近在拉丁美洲进行的一系列挑衅活动——继续用美国飞机空袭古巴，派美国海军陆战队在多米尼加登陆，并在加勒比海进行恫吓性的海军演习。
    评论谈到，古巴和其他拉丁美洲国家六十六个政党和公众团体发表了联合声明，号召在3月20日开始举行“支持拉丁美洲人民周”，声明警告艾森豪威尔注意不久以前尼克松在这个地区的遭遇。
    新华社23日讯　德意志民主共和国和波兰的报纸，就美国总统艾森豪威尔的南美之行发表了评论。
    德意志民主共和国的“新德意志报”发表文章说，美国同南美各国的联盟正在解体。美国副总统尼克松两年前到南美进行的访问，丝毫无助于改善同南美国家的关系。从那个时候起，玻利维亚、巴拿马、委内瑞拉和古巴的反美情绪大大高涨了。在联合国最近的一次会议上，八个拉丁美洲国家在安全理事会非常任理事国的选举问题上投票反对美国。
    文章指出，很明显，拉丁美洲国家对于美国对它们的监护和剥削感到厌恶。艾森豪威尔这次访问南美的目的是，试图阻止拉丁美洲在联合国中的这种倾向的发展，并挽救美国在南美的市场。可是，拉丁美洲国家的人民不见得会受美国的空洞诺言的欺骗。
    波兰“劳动之声报”指出，美国总统的这次访问的目的在于指望加强拉丁美洲进步运动的镇压者——“美洲国家组织”，并指望使拉丁美洲国家在联合国组织中继续支持美国。报纸说，因为拉丁美洲国家已更加以自己的民族利益为重。这家报纸说，时代已经变了，这次美国总统在“不满意者”国家中的访问，能否给美国带来具体成就，是值得怀疑的。
