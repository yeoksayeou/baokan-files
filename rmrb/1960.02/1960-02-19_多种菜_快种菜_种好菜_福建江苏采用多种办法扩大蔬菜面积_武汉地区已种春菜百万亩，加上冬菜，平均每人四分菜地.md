Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou. Fujian Province is adopting various methods to expand vegetable planting areas. In the suburbs of Fuzhou, more than 18,000 people are rushing to plant vegetables every day. By the beginning of this month, they have planted more than 33,600 mu of vegetables, striving to expand to 45,000 mu by the end of the month. Rural people's communes are mobilizing members to plant vegetables using every possible means on vacant land around villages, houses, ponds, canals, riverbanks, and field ridges. They are also expanding vegetable planting areas by reclaiming wasteland and intercropping in orchards and forest farms, striving for abundant grain and sufficient vegetables.

Fujian is located in a subtropical zone where vegetables can be planted all year round. Various regions are using this favorable condition to increase vegetable planting areas to meet the needs of urban and rural people and to use as pig feed. According to incomplete statistics from Fuzhou, Xiamen, Jinjiang, Longxi, Fu'an, Longyan, Minhou and other regions, the vegetable planting area in January this year increased nearly doubled compared to the same period last year. In the suburbs of cities such as Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou, due to the expansion of vegetable planting areas, in addition to meeting local market needs, they can also process and transfer a large amount of vegetables. Xiamen alone transferred more than 7,900 dan of vegetables to support other regions during the Spring Festival.

When arranging this year's vegetable production, various regions not only pay attention to the increase in quantity, but also to the diversification of varieties, appropriately arranging long-term vegetables and short-term vegetables, and matching high-yield vegetables with vegetables with higher nutritional value. Fuzhou City has arranged more than 250 vegetable varieties this year. According to Fujian's excellent climate, various regions are also constantly experimenting with and promoting winter vegetables in summer and summer vegetables in winter, so that vegetables are evergreen in all seasons and eliminate the difference between slack and peak seasons.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing. Jiangsu Province is seizing the opportunity of the current warming climate to launch a concentrated planting of spring vegetables.

After formulating spring vegetable planting plans, people's communes in various regions have mobilized members to carry out soil turning, land preparation, fertilization, and sowing of spring vegetables at the fastest speed and with meticulous efforts on vegetable bases, in the garden fields of public canteens, or on winter idle land such as riverbanks and roadsides. Under the slogan of "Plant More Vegetables, Plant Vegetables Quickly, Plant Vegetables Well," the Machang Commune in Shuyang County concentrated more than 2,000 laborers and, in a day of hard work, turned over all the "ten-side" lands such as riverbanks, roadsides, and house edges in the entire commune, applied sufficient fertilizer, and sowed various vegetable seedlings. Each production team of the Henghua Commune in Yizheng County proposed that no soil should be planted until it is turned, no mud should be planted until it is loose, and no planting should be done without fertilization, ensuring good planting, good management, and good growth, and completing the sowing task of more than 2,600 mu of spring vegetables quickly and well.

While strengthening the management of winter vegetable fields, the suburbs of ten cities including Nanjing, Yangzhou, and Suzhou have also launched a surge of concentrated planting of spring vegetables. The suburbs of these ten cities plan to sow more than 140,000 mu more spring vegetables this year than in the same period last year. At present, the plan has been implemented to the team and to the field, and land preparation and sowing have begun.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan. People's communes in various counties of the Wuhan area, Hubei Province, are rushing to plant spring vegetables. According to statistics from relevant departments, from February 5th to 14th, the Wuhan area has concentratedly sown 1.07 million mu of various vegetables such as radishes, cabbage, spinach, and lettuce. Together with the original 1.3 million mu of winter vegetables, the current average for the entire region is more than four fen of vegetable plots per person, an increase of more than two fen per person compared to the past. JiaYu, Hanyang, Huangpi and other counties average half a mu of vegetable plots or more per person.

Early start, rapid progress, more sowing, and good quality are the biggest characteristics of this year's spring vegetable planting in the Wuhan area. Before the Spring Festival, while strengthening the field management of winter vegetables, various regions planned and arranged for spring vegetable production. After the beginning of spring, various regions immediately seized the opportunity to rush to plant. When rushing to plant, Xiaogan County adopted methods such as "Three Bigs" (big mobilization, big cooperation, big red flags) and "Three Guarantees" (guarantee planting, guarantee survival, guarantee bumper harvest), organized a batch of shock teams, concentrated more than 11,000 head of cattle, and simultaneously prepared fields, delivered fertilizer, and sowed seeds. In just eight days, it sowed more than 100,000 mu of various vegetables.

Since rushing to plant spring vegetables is in the busy spring plowing season, Party organizations at all levels in the Wuhan area paid attention to grasping typical examples, grasping ideology, and deeply mobilizing the masses from the beginning, carrying out big airing, big blooming, and big debates, thereby overcoming various ideas that do not attach importance to spring vegetable planting. For example, at the beginning, some people in the Zhashan People's Commune in Hanyang County believed that to grow vegetables, they would have to squeeze out rice. After the big airing, big blooming, and big debates, the entire commune spent only ten days using wasteland, field edges, corners, and open spaces to sow more than 10,000 mu of spring vegetables. The Hanyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly promoted their experience, and the county's spring vegetable planting area quickly expanded from the original 20,000 mu to more than 50,000 mu.

In order to meet the needs of urban people for vegetables, counties in the Wuhan area have implemented the policy of simultaneously promoting self-sufficiency production and commodity production when sowing spring vegetables. For example, people's communes close to towns have determined several production teams as vegetable production bases based on land, transportation, and other conditions. Yingcheng County alone has established eight vegetable bases with a total area of more than 18,000 mu, and organized more than 280 professional teams to specialize in the production of these vegetable bases. In addition, each production team has also established its own vegetable base with the canteen as a unit.

    多种菜  快种菜  种好菜
    福建江苏采用多种办法扩大蔬菜面积
    武汉地区已种春菜百万亩，加上冬菜，平均每人四分菜地
    据新华社福州电　福建各地采取多种办法扩大蔬菜种植面积。福州市郊每天有一万八千多人在抢种蔬菜，到本月上旬已种菜三万三千六百多亩，力争到月底扩种到四万五千亩。农村各人民公社都发动社员千方百计用村前屋后、塘边、渠边、河边、田埂等空闲土地种植蔬菜，并且用开垦荒地和在果园、林场套种等办法扩大蔬菜种植面积，力争粮丰蔬菜足。
    福建地处亚热带，终年可以种菜。各地都利用这一有利条件增加蔬菜种植面积，满足城乡人民生活需要和用作养猪饲料。据福州、厦门两地和晋江、龙溪、福安、龙岩、闽侯等专区的不完全统计，今年1月份，蔬菜种植面积比去年同期增加将近一倍。厦门、泉州、漳州等城市郊区，由于蔬菜种植面积扩大，除满足当地市场需要外，还能大量加工、外调。厦门仅在春节期间即调出七千九百多担蔬菜，支援外地。
    各地在安排今年蔬菜生产时，不仅注意到数量的增加，还注意到品种多样化，长期菜和短期菜适当安排，高产量菜和营养价值较高的菜互相搭配。福州市今年即安排了二百五十多个蔬菜品种。根据福建的优良气候，各地还不断试验和推广冬菜夏种、夏菜冬种，达到蔬菜四季常青，消灭淡、旺季的差别。
    据新华社南京电　江苏各地抓紧当前气候转暖的时机，突击种植春菜。
    各地人民公社在制订了春菜种植规划之后，都发动社员，在蔬菜基地上和公共食堂的园田里，或者在河边、路边等冬闲地上，以最快的速度和精细的工夫进行翻土、整地、施肥和播种春菜。沭阳县马厂公社在“多种菜、快种菜、种好菜”的口号下，集中了两千多名劳动力，突击一天，就将全社所有的河边、路边、屋边等“十边”土地翻好，施上足够的肥料，撒下了各种菜秧。仪征县恒华公社各个生产队提出土不翻不种、泥不疏松不种、不施肥料不种，保证栽种好、管理好、生长好，又快又好地完成了二千六百多亩春菜的播种任务。
    南京、扬州、苏州等十个城市的郊区在加强冬菜田管理的同时，也掀起了突击种植春菜的热潮。这十个城市的郊区，今年计划春播蔬菜比去年同期增加十四万多亩，目前规划已落实到队、到田，并开始整地播种。
    据新华社武汉电　湖北省武汉地区各县人民公社正在抢种春菜。据有关部门统计，从2月5日到14日的十天当中，武汉地区已经突击播种萝卜、白菜、菠菜、莴苣等各种蔬菜一百零七万亩；加上原有的一百三十万亩冬菜，目前全区平均每人有四分多菜地，比过去增加了两分多地。嘉鱼、汉阳、黄陂等县平均每人有菜地半亩以上。
    动手早、进展快，播种多，质量好，是武汉地区今年种植春菜的最大特点。春节前，各地在加强冬菜田间管理的同时，就对春菜生产作了规划和安排。立春后，各地便立即抓住时机突击抢种。孝感县在抢种时采用“三大”（大动员、大协作、大插红旗）、“三保”（保种、保活、保丰收）等办法，组织一批突击队，集中了一万一千多头耕牛，边整田、边送肥、边播种，只八天时间，就播种各类蔬菜十万多亩。
    由于抢种春菜正在繁忙的春耕季节。因此，武汉地区各级党组织一开始就注意抓典型，抓思想，深入发动群众，开展大鸣大放大辩论，从而克服了各种不重视春菜种植的思想。例如，汉阳县奓山人民公社开始有人认为，要种蔬菜就得挤掉水稻。经过大鸣大放大辩论以后，全社只用十多天时间，就利用荒地、田边、地角、空场播种了一万多亩春菜。中共汉阳县委及时推广了他们的经验，全县春菜播种面积迅速由原来的两万亩扩大到五万多亩。
    为了满足城镇人民对蔬菜的需要，武汉地区各县在播种春菜时，都贯彻执行了自给性生产同商品性生产同时并举的方针。例如，接近城镇的各人民公社根据土地、交通等条件，确定了若干个生产队作为蔬菜生产基地。仅应城县就建立了八个蔬菜基地，面积共一万八千多亩，并组织了二百八十多个专业队，专门管理这些蔬菜基地的生产。此外，各个生产队也都以食堂为单位，建立了自己的蔬菜基地。
