    Heirs of the Vandals, Stop!
    Tao Menghe
    The news that the U.S. government and the Chiang Kai-shek clique have signed a contract to transport a large number of cultural relics from Taiwan to the United States for exhibition has shocked every Chinese person and aroused boundless anger in every Chinese person. We firmly support the Ministry of Culture's stern and righteous statement on this matter. The Chinese people, including our compatriots in Taiwan, resolutely do not recognize this illegal so-called "contract"! We resolutely will not allow American imperialism to plunder our country's precious cultural relics! At the same time, we sternly warn the Chiang Kai-shek clique to immediately stop their criminal act of stealing and selling national cultural relics!
    The large number of cultural relics that the Chiang Kai-shek clique seized from the mainland and transported to Taiwan in the spring of 1949 are the precious property of the Chinese people. Their sovereignty belongs to the country, not to the Chiang Kai-shek clique. I pointed out this well-known truth in 1949 when the Chiang Kai-shek clique was carrying out the seizure of cultural relics for transport to Taiwan. However, these precious cultural relics were finally seized and transported to Taiwan. Today, the Chiang Kai-shek clique's only responsibility is to take good care of them, preserve them, and prevent them from being lost or dispersed in any way, in order to return them to the motherland in the future. Only in this way can they slightly reduce the original guilt of transporting these cultural relics to Taiwan, otherwise, the people will remember the account very clearly.
    These cultural relics are the crystallization of the cultural arts created by the Chinese people with their brains and labor over thousands of years, and they represent the essence of China's long history and culture. As a Chinese person, we all of course wholeheartedly love and cherish them. We are today the Chinese people who have stood up, engaged in the construction of socialist cause under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. Therefore, we all the more respect the hard work of our ancestors, and all the more value and cherish the exquisite and unparalleled fruits of labor left by our ancestors. We absolutely cannot allow prodigal sons to arbitrarily disperse the country's precious cultural relics, or even give them away to foreigners! My patriotic compatriots in Taiwan will also never be willing to allow the Chiang Kai-shek clique's conspiracy of colluding with American imperialism to steal and sell the cultural relics of the motherland to be realized. Therefore, my compatriots in Taiwan should make every effort to oppose this shameless criminal act of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and resolutely prevent these cultural relics from leaving Taiwan. We are very familiar with and very clear about the shameless tricks of American imperialism in cleverly seizing and forcibly plundering exquisite cultural relics. Let me cite one or two examples. May I ask: During the War of Resistance Against Japan, where are the skulls of "Peking Man" and all the materials about the excavation of Peking Man that American imperialism "safeguarded" and transported on our behalf? Fifteen years have passed since the end of World War II, and not to mention the skull, even a tooth or a small bone of "Peking Man" has not been returned to us. May I also ask: More than 20,000 volumes of rare books from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties in the Peking Library were transported to the United States in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan (1937) and deposited in the Library of Congress in the United States. Now, these precious books have been deposited for twenty-three years, why has not even one volume been returned to us? It is known that the library casually lends out these rare Chinese books, many of which are even unique copies, without protecting them, and it is now impossible to investigate how many kinds have been damaged. This is the true situation of American imperialism "safeguarding" cultural relics for us. This is also the shameless trick commonly used by American imperialism to expand its collection of cultural relics and books and carry out cultural aggression.
    Before liberation, the despicable and shameless means of theft, destruction, and robbery used by those so-called American archaeologists, artists, etc., who came to China to steal, destroy, and plunder our precious cultural relics and historical sites in Dunhuang, Luoyang, Beijing, etc., are known to the world. From these facts, it can be clearly seen that they do not know how to cherish cultural relics at all. American imperialism is pursuing a policy of cultural aggression in the world. This policy is to promote the American way of life, eliminate all other cultures, and only plunder, occupy, destroy, and annihilate the cultural and artistic heritage of other countries. Therefore, American imperialism is the number one enemy of all national cultures. This time, the Chiang Kai-shek clique is giving our most precious cultural relics to this number one enemy, which we absolutely cannot allow.
    In fact, it has never happened in the past world history that a country has transported such a large number of exquisite and unparalleled cultural relics across the ocean to another country. It is impossible to imagine proposing such a crazy plan as transporting the most exquisite cultural relics preserved in the entire Rome, the entire Paris, or the entire London to foreign countries for exhibition. And what American imperialism is doing to our cultural relics in Taiwan is precisely such a crazy plan. In the fifth century in Europe, there was a Vandal nation that specialized in being hostile to works of art and natural beauty, ravaged Western Europe, and destroyed Roman cultural sites. Therefore, Vandalism has today become synonymous with destroying cultural relics and destroying works of art. The Vandal nation has long been extinct, and their barbaric acts against culture and art have long disappeared. The progress of all human culture can no longer allow the continued existence of Vandalism. However, today, fifteen hundred years later, American imperialism actually wants to be the heir of the Vandals, and insists on carrying out a historical re-enactment of Vandalism against the world's largest and oldest Chinese people's most cherished, unparalleled cultural relics. Not only must we resolutely stop their barbaric actions. All rational people in the world, including the good American people, will also resolutely oppose it.
    Finally, I want to warn American imperialism: Do not be modern Vandals. Your crazy act of stealing and transporting Chinese cultural relics to the United States will surely be subject to the moral sanctions of the people of the world, and will surely be subject to the final judgment of history.

    万达尔的继承者，住手！
    陶孟和
    美国政府和蒋介石集团签订合同，把存在台湾的大批文物运美展览这个消息震惊了每个中国人，激起了每个中国人无比的愤怒。我们坚决拥护文化部对此事件的词严义正的声明。中国人民，包括我台湾同胞在内，坚决不承认这个非法的所谓“合同”！坚决不允许美帝劫夺我国的宝贵文物！同时严厉地警告蒋介石集团马上停止盗卖国家文物的罪恶行为！
    蒋介石集团在1949年春天由大陆劫夺到台湾去的大批文物是中国人民的宝贵财产，它的主权属于国家，而不属于蒋介石集团。这个尽人皆知的道理，我在1949年蒋介石集团进行劫夺文物运台之际，曾经指出过了，但是这批宝贵文物终于被劫运到台湾。今天蒋介石集团唯一的责任，就是好好地看守它、保全它，不让它有丝毫损失、分散，以待将来归还祖国。庶可以减轻原来把这批文物运往台湾的罪谴于万一，否则，人民的账上是记得很清楚的。
    这批文物是中国人民几千年来用脑力和体力创造出来的文化艺术结晶，代表中国悠久文化的精华。做为一个中国人，我们每人当然衷心地喜爱它、珍视它。我们今天是站起来的中国人民，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席英明领导下从事建设社会主义事业的人，因此我们就越发尊崇我们祖先的辛勤劳动，就越发重视和爱护我们祖先遗留下来的精美绝伦的劳动成果。我们绝对不能容许败家子把祖国的宝贵文物随意分散，乃至送给外人！我台湾爱国同胞，也决不会甘心让蒋介石集团的这种勾结美帝盗卖祖国文物的阴谋实现，因此，我台湾同胞应该做出一切努力反对蒋介石集团这一无耻的罪恶行为，坚决制止这批文物离开台湾。美帝国主义对精美文物的巧取强夺那一套的无耻伎俩，我们是十分熟悉，十分清楚的。试举一二例。请问：在抗战时期，美帝国主义代我们“保管”迁运的“北京人”头颅以及关于北京人发掘的一切材料，现在都保存在哪里去了？第二次世界大战已经结束十五年了，不要说那个头骨，就连“北京人”的一颗牙齿、一块小骨头也没有送还给我们。再请问：北京图书馆有两万多册宋元明版本的善本图书在抗战初期（1937年）运到美国，寄存在美国国会图书馆里。现在这批宝贵的图书已经寄存二十三年了，为什么至今连一本也没有交还给我们？据知那个图书馆却把这批中国稀有的、其中甚至有许多是独一无二的孤本、善本书籍随便出借，任人翻阅不知保护，现在究竟已经损坏多少种，也无所考察。这就是美帝国主义为我们“保管”文物的真实情况。这也就是美帝国主义扩大它的文物、图书收藏，进行文化侵略所惯常使用的无耻伎俩。
    解放以前，那些美国的所谓考古家、艺术家等等到中国来，在敦煌、洛阳、北京等地对于我们的珍贵文物、古迹所使用的盗取、破坏、抢夺等等卑鄙无耻手段，是举世共知的。从这些事实就可以清楚地看出他们对于文化古物是丝毫不知爱惜的。美帝国主义在世界上所执行的是文化侵略政策，这个政策就是推销美国生活方式，消灭一切其它文化，对于别国的文化艺术遗产，只有掠夺、占有、摧残和毁灭。因此，美帝国主义是一切民族文化的头号敌人。这一次蒋介石集团把我们最宝贵的文物送给这个头号敌人，这是我们绝不能允许的。
    实在说，从一个国家运送这样大量的精美无比的文物远涉重洋，交给另外一个国家，在过去的世界历史上从来没有出现过。从来不能设想，提出一个把整个罗马、整个巴黎或者整个伦敦所保存的最精美的文物运往国外展览这一类的疯狂计划。而美帝对我们存在台湾的文物所进行的正是这样的疯狂计划。欧洲第五世纪时，有一个万达尔民族，专门与艺术品、自然美为敌，蹂躏了西欧，破坏了罗马文化古迹。因此，万达尔主义今天已经成了摧残文物，毁灭艺术品的代名词。万达尔民族早已灭绝了，他们对文化艺术的野蛮举动也早已绝迹了，全体人类文化的进步已经不能再容许万达尔主义的继续存在了。然而在一千五百年后的今天，美帝国主义居然要想做万达尔的继承者，硬要对世界上最大最古的中国人民所最珍爱的举世无双的文物进行万达尔主义的历史重演。不单是我们要坚决制止他们的这一野蛮行动。全世界有理智的人们，其中包括善良的美国人民在内，也一定会坚决反对的。
    最后，我要警告美帝国主义：你们不要做现代的万达尔主义者。你们盗运中国文物到美国的这个疯狂行动一定会受到全世界人民道义上的制裁，一定会受到历史最终的审判。
