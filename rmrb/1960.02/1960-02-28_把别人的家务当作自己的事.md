    Taking other people's housework as one's own
    Wang Suqin, Head of the Chunhua Street No. 2 Courtyard Service Station
    In 1958, all the staff and family members in our courtyard participated in production during the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward. After the staff and family members entered the factories, they were busy with production and study, and they did not have much time to do some housework such as buying rice, buying firewood, and dismantling, washing, and mending clothes. In this case, we thought, wouldn't it save a lot of manpower and time if we concentrated everyone's housework and had a few people to take care of it? The street party committee decided to set up a service station in our courtyard and asked me to be a service worker, and as a result, the first service station in Harbin was established.
    After the service station was established, most of the housework was managed by the service station. If each family had anything to do, they just had to write a note, and we would take care of it for them. In this way, everyone saved a lot of time and was able to carry out production and study better. Later, we discovered that the comrades went to work very early and had to cook. If we made breakfast for them, wouldn't they be able to rest more? With the support of the Party organization and state-owned commercial departments, we prepared breakfast for the employees who could not cook in the morning. We also set up a steamer in the service station to heat food for elementary school students who ate at home at noon and employees who got off work late. If someone had a meeting in the evening or had something to do and needed to come back very late, as long as they told us, we would cook for them so that they could eat hot food as soon as they came back.
    In the spirit of serving the masses, taking other people's housework as the service worker's own, we took care of any housework that the staff comrades could not take care of. One day, Zhu Meixia in our courtyard caught a cold and needed to be hospitalized. Zhu Meixia had two children under the age of three. If she went to the hospital, her lover would have to ask for leave, so I took care of her two children. I put them in the service station during the day and took them to my home in the evening, so that Zhu Meixia could stay in the hospital for seven days with peace of mind, and as a result, her illness was cured.
    After the service station was established, I not only served others, but others also actively served me. During the Spring Festival, my stomach problem relapsed and I couldn't eat hard things. Everyone took care of me very thoughtfully. Aunt Nan, a Korean, cooked for me, and Aunt Wei took the initiative to send me a hot water bottle after hearing about it. My neighbor, Aunt Guo, would light the stove and warm the room every day when I came back, so that I could concentrate more on doing a good job in the service work.
    Serving workers is a very glorious job. In the future, under the leadership and education of the Party, I will study Mao Zedong Thought hard, continuously improve my theoretical and professional level, do a good job in the service work, and contribute all my strength to better promote the Great Leap Forward in production.

    把别人的家务当作自己的事
    纯化街二号大院服务站站长　王素琴
    1958年，我们全院的职工家属，在大跃进的高潮中，都参加了生产。职工家属进工厂之后，都忙着生产和学习，买米、买柴、拆洗缝补等一些家务事就没有更多的时间去干了。在这种情况下，我们想把大家的家务事集中起来，用几个人专门来办，不是能节省好多人力、时间吗？街道党委决定在我们院成立服务站，还让我作服务员，结果办起了哈尔滨市第一个服务站。
    服务站办起来以后，大部分家务劳动都由服务站来管。各家有什么事只要写个条子，我们就代替办了。这样，大家就节省了不少的时间，能够更好地进行生产和学习。后来我们又发现，同志们上班很早，还要做饭，要是我们代做早饭，他们不就可以多休息一会儿吗？在党组织和国营商业部门的支持下，我们为早晨不能做饭的职工准备了早点。并在服务站中设立了一个蒸锅，为那些中午在家吃饭的小学生和下班晚的职工热饭。有的人如果晚间开会或有事情需要很晚才能回来，只要告诉一声，我们就代他把饭做好，使他回来后能立即吃到热饭。
    本着为群众服务的精神，把别人的家务当做服务员自家的事，只要职工同志们有照顾不过来的家务，我们都代管。我们院的朱美霞有一天得了感冒，需要住医院。朱美霞有两个三岁以下的孩子，她去住院，她的爱人就得请假，于是我就给她照看两个孩子，白天放在服务站，晚间领到我家，使朱美霞安心在医院住了七天，结果治好了病。
    服务站建立之后，我不仅为别人服务，别人也积极为我服务。春节期间，我的胃病又犯了，吃不下硬东西。大家对我照顾的非常周到。院内的朝鲜族南大娘给我作饭吃，魏大娘听说之后主动地给我送热水袋。我的邻居郭大娘，每天在我回去的时候，都把炉子点着，将屋子整得暖和和的，使我能够更集中精力搞好服务工作。
    服务员是个非常光荣的工作，今后我要在党的领导和教育下，努力学习毛泽东思想，不断地提高自己的理论业务水平，作好服务工作，为更好地促进生产大跃进而贡献全部力量。（附图片）
