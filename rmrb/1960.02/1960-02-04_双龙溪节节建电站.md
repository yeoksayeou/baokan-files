Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, February 3rd: Shuanglong People's Commune in Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province, comprehensively developed its water resources. By damming the Shuanglong Stream, which is only seven kilometers long, section by section, they built eight small hydroelectric power stations with a total installed capacity of 871 kilowatts.

    The establishment of eight hydroelectric power stations on the Shuanglong Stream has greatly inspired the members' enthusiasm for building socialism. Now, the Shuanglong Commune has begun using electric pumps and electric machine tools, using electricity for sawing boards, drilling, welding, rice milling, flour milling, and processing feed. There are electric plows and electric artificial rainfall irrigation, etc., which have played a huge role in promoting industrial and agricultural production. Fifteen of the larger villages in the entire commune have also begun using electric lights for illumination.

    双龙溪节节建电站
    据新华社杭州三日电　浙江金华县双龙人民公社综合开发水力资源，在全长仅七公里的双龙溪上节节拦水，建起了八座小型水力发电站，装机容量共达八百七十一瓩。
    双龙溪一水建立八个水电站，极大地鼓舞了社员们建设社会主义的热情。现在双龙公社已用上了电动抽水机、电动机床，用电力锯板、钻孔、电焊、碾米、磨粉、加工饲料，有了电犁和电动人工降雨灌溉等，对促进工农业生产起了巨大的作用。全公社有十五个较大的村子，也开始用电灯来照明了。
