    "Great Friendship" Filming Notes
    Wang Yonghong
    In the process of creating the film "Great Friendship," we deeply felt the greatness and strength of Sino-Soviet friendship.
    We consulted many historical materials recording Sino-Soviet friendship: Since the great October Socialist Revolution, the people of China and the Soviet Union have always supported each other unswervingly in their common revolutionary cause. During the years of the October Revolution and the civil war, tens of thousands of Chinese workers working in Russia, under the call of the Bolshevik Party, fought side by side with their Russian worker and peasant brothers, achieved a great victory in the proletarian revolutionary struggle, and defended the Soviet regime.
    After the victory of the October Revolution, the Soviet people also closely watched the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people. After the news of the May 30th Massacre of 1925 reached the Soviet Union, the people of Moscow held demonstrations and parades to support and support the anti-imperialist struggle of the Chinese people. With the enthusiastic assistance of our comrades at the Soviet Central Documentary Film Studio, we found these extremely precious historical film materials. Their production tasks were very busy, but they still helped us find these materials as soon as possible and reprinted the film for us.
    Our film focuses on reflecting the fraternal friendly relations between the people of the two countries since the founding of New China. The Soviet government and people have given tremendous assistance to our country's economic construction. Soviet experts who came to help our country with socialist construction worked selflessly alongside the Chinese people, fearing no hardships and sparing no effort.
    Part of our film crew went to the Amur region of the Soviet Far East in September last year to film the friendship between the people of the two border regions. There, we were warmly received and given great assistance. The First Secretary of the State Party Committee said when he met with us: "Your work is our work. If you have any difficulties, please bring them up and we will definitely help solve them." Our filming was carried out under the personal direction of Cherobanov, the Third Secretary of the State Party Committee. When he saw that our photographer was too busy, he immediately called the Far East Film Studio in Khabarovsk and asked them to send someone to help.
    In a hospital in the Amur region, we filmed the process of rescuing the life of Chinese child Meng Xianguo: Meng Xianguo fell on the stove, and his face, arms, and chest were all burned by the stove fire. In a very critical situation, we had no choice but to cross the river and ask the Soviet elder brother for help in treatment. The child's condition was very serious. After diagnosis, the only way was to transplant skin to the child. At that time, the medical staff in the hospital scrambled to sign up, willing to transplant their own skin onto the Chinese child. After skin grafting, Meng Xianguo quickly recovered his health.
    When we were filming, Meng Xianguo's mother said to us very excitedly: "If Xiao Meng Xianguo had not been born in this era, he would have died long ago. If it were not for the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and if it were not for the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, how could a rural child be rescued? When the child grows up, I will tell him that it was the Soviet people who saved his life, and that the skin of a Soviet aunt is growing on his body."
    These words made us feel more deeply and more concretely that the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is as close as flesh and blood, and that this flesh-and-blood friendship has become an invincible force.

    “伟大的友谊”摄制散记
    王永宏
    我们在从事影片“伟大的友谊”的创作过程中，深刻地感受到中苏友谊的伟大和力量。
    我们翻阅了许多记载着中苏友谊的历史资料：自伟大的十月社会主义革命之后，中苏两国人民在共同的革命事业里始终不渝地相互支援。在十月革命和国内战争的年代里，好几万在俄国做工的中国工人，在布尔什维克党的号召下，同俄国的工人、农民兄弟并肩作战，取得了无产阶级革命斗争的伟大胜利，保卫了苏维埃政权。
    十月革命胜利后，苏联人民也密切注视着中国人民的革命斗争。1925年的五卅惨案消息传到苏联后，莫斯科人民举行示威大游行，支持和声援中国人民的反帝斗争。我们在苏联中央文献电影制片厂的同志们热情协助下，找到了这些异常珍贵的历史影片资料。他们的生产任务十分繁忙，但仍然尽快地帮助我们把这些资料找到，翻印出影片给我们。
    我们的影片，着重反映了新中国成立以后两国人民兄弟般的友好关系。苏联政府和人民对我国的经济建设给予了巨大的援助。前来帮助我国进行社会主义建设的苏联专家们，不畏艰险，不辞劳苦，和我国人民一道进行着忘我的劳动。
    我们摄制组的一部分同志在去年9月到了苏联远东边疆的阿穆尔州，拍摄两国边疆人民的友谊。在那里，我们受到了盛情款待和大力协助。州委第一书记在接见我们的时候说：“你们的工作就是我们的工作，有任何困难尽管提出来，我们一定帮助解决。”我们的拍摄工作是在州委第三书记切罗班诺夫亲自主持下进行的。当他见到我们的摄影师忙不过来时，立即给伯力远东电影制片厂打电话，要他们派人来支援。
    我们在阿穆尔州的一所医院里，拍摄了抢救中国小孩孟宪国生命的经过：孟宪国跌倒在火炉上，面部、手臂和胸部全被炉火烧伤。在十分危急的情况下，只好过江请求苏联老大哥帮助医治。孩子的伤情很重，经过诊断，唯一的办法就是给孩子移植皮肤。当时医院里的医务人员都争先恐后地报名，乐意把自己的皮肤移植到中国孩子的身上。经过植皮，孟宪国很快恢复了健康。
    我们在拍片时，孟宪国的妈妈就非常激动地对我们说：“小孟宪国要不是生在这个时代，早就没命了。要不是共产党和毛主席的领导，要不是中苏两国人民结成的伟大友谊，一个农村的孩子还能得到抢救？等孩子长大了我要告诉他，是苏联人救活了他的生命，在他的身上生长着苏联阿姨的皮肤。”
    这一段话，使我们更加深刻、更加具体地感受到：中苏两国人民之间的友谊亲如骨肉，而这种骨肉般的友情已变为不可战胜的力量了。
