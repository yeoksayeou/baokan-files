    Preparing for the Aftermath
    Poem by Chi Bei'ou, Drawing by Fang Cheng
    The honorable congressmen, with nothing better to do,
    Come up with a novel proposal:
    If an atomic war breaks out,
    How to maintain "democratic politics"?
    Nuclear weapons keep flying,
    Congressmen will inevitably be bombed to death,
    With few left out of the four hundred plus,
    It will be difficult for Congress to hold meetings.
    Therefore, a law is solemnly passed,
    Specifically to prepare for the aftermath for congressmen,
    Officially authorizing each state governor,
    To appoint living people as replacements when the time comes.
    Gathering enough to exceed the legal quorum,
    Arguing and clamoring as usual,
    If it is necessary to approve surrender,
    A resolution can also be barely made.
    There are many amusing things in the American Congress,
    But this one is the most ridiculous,
    In order to create an atmosphere of war,
    They are not afraid of others laughing their heads off.

    Reported: The U.S. Senate passed an amendment on February 3, giving state governors the power to appoint people to replace members of the House of Representatives if the congressmen die in an atomic attack. However, this power can only be used when more than half of the four hundred and thirty-five members of the House of Representatives have died.

    准备后事

    议员先生闲来无事，
    想出一项新鲜议题：
    一旦爆发原子战争，
    怎样维持“民主政治”？
    核子武器不断飞来，
    议员难免会被炸死，
    四百余人剩下无几，
    议会碍难召开会议。
    特此郑重通过法案，
    专为议员准备后事，
    正式授权各州州长，
    届时任命活人顶替。
    凑够法定过半人数，
    争吵喧嚷有如平时，
    设若需要批准投降，
    也可勉强作出决议。
    美国议会妙事不少，
    要数这桩最为滑稽，
    为了制造战争空气，
    不怕别人笑痛肚皮。
    报载：美国参议院2月3日通过一项修正案，给予各州州长任命人选代替众议院议员的权力，如果议员们在原子袭击下死去的话。不过这种权力只有在四百三十五名众议员的一半以上死去时才能使用。
