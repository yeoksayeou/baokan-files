How We Utilize Natural Gas
Gu Bicheng, Secretary of the CPC Chuansha County Committee

Chuansha County, a suburb of Shanghai, is an alluvial plain. Its subsurface is layered with thick and thin deposits of decayed organic silt, containing abundant combustible gas, namely natural gas.

In 1958, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, along with the nationwide great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the people of Chuansha, in a mass revolutionary movement of fervent enthusiasm, broke down superstitions, liberated their minds, and developed a communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, boldly developing and utilizing natural gas. The establishment of rural people's communes, in particular, created favorable conditions for the utilization of natural gas. Over the past year, relying on the hard work, practical work, and ingenuity of the people of the entire county, we have drilled a total of 1,205 gas wells, of which 625 have been utilized at various times, and 196 wells are currently in normal use. These wells can produce 100,000 cubic meters of natural gas per day. If this natural gas were used to power machinery, it could generate 20,000 horsepower, saving 4,800 tons of coal or 144,000 dan of firewood per month. Currently, natural gas is used in industry for power generation, battery charging, machine operation, brick and tile firing, and carbon black production; in agricultural and sideline industries for tractor operation, mechanical irrigation, feed cooking, and agricultural and sideline product processing; in daily life for cooking, lighting, and heating; and in transportation for powering automobiles. The application of natural gas in power stations and tractors provides very favorable conditions for accelerating the mechanization and electrification of agriculture.

Over the past year, in the process of developing and utilizing natural gas, we have successively overcome five major hurdles: ideological, technical, material, labor, and financial. The deepening and improvement of the natural gas movement in Chuansha County are inseparable from our specific solutions to these problems.

Throughout the process of developing and utilizing natural gas, the struggle between advanced and backward ideologies has been constantly present. By strengthening leadership and adhering to putting politics in command, we have successively overcome various ideological tendencies, such as superstition and fear of difficulty, and right-leaning slackness, at different times. Since our visit to Nanjing and Guangdong in April 1958 to see artificial biogas production, we conducted experiments in towns and other areas of the county, and also carried out drilling at a natural gas outcrop in Longwangmiao, but without success. Subsequently, we spent more than a month continuously drilling 200 times, but failed due to the unclear distribution of gas layers. At that time, some people took the opportunity to pour cold water, and some natural gas workers also developed a pessimistic mood. In response to this thinking, the county party committee strengthened leadership organizationally and established a natural gas command. Each commune correspondingly established a natural gas office and organized visits to Nanhuai, Fengxian counties and the Qiyi commune to learn from advanced experiences in biogas utilization. We were inspired by these examples and raised the question of "If others can do it, why can't we?" for debate, thereby liberating our minds and establishing confidence. The leadership also adopted a method of combining with cadres and the masses, insisting on experimentation, and finally dug a natural gas well in the original Qinjian cooperative. The county party committee immediately seized this banner and held on-site meetings to organize promotion. Later, large gas wells with a pressure of 55 pounds were successively drilled in Yongle, Wanggang, Gonglu and other areas. One fact after another more powerfully liberated people's thinking. Through initial exploration, we have grasped the distribution of gas layers, and the natural gas movement has flourished. In less than two months, there were more than 30 normally utilized gas wells, and in July it leaped to more than 150, embarking on a path of comprehensive development.

Developing and utilizing natural gas is a new task, and we lack experience. Initially, due to the lack of clarity in the idea of relying on the masses, we placed our hopes on a small number of professional drilling personnel. It took several months to drill more than 200 wells, but the efficiency of gas exploration was not high. From this, we learned a profound lesson: we must rely on the masses and explain the difficulties to them. We proposed the slogan "To dig underground gas, we must break through the drill bit barrier" to the masses. After everyone engaged in innovation and creation, in a short period of time, more than ten kinds of drill bits that could extract soil samples and explore gas, such as swivel drill bits and toothed drill bits, were created. After using these new tools, the efficiency of drilling wells was significantly improved. Initially, it took ten people three or four days to drill a well, but now it only takes six people four or five hours. After breaking through the above barriers, we encountered the quicksand blockage barrier. Due to the blockage of quicksand, the life of gas wells was not long. Encouraged by our timely slogan of "Greatly break through the quicksand layer and ensure the longevity of gas wells," the masses created a variety of filter pipes made of iron, bamboo, iron wire, and wrapped in palm fiber, which initially solved the problem of quicksand blockage and extended the life of gas wells from one month to more than a year.

The exploitation and utilization of natural gas requires certain equipment and facilities, but we lack these things. The way to overcome this difficulty is to resolutely implement the principle of using local materials instead of foreign ones, combining local and foreign methods, and the policy of running all undertakings diligently and thriftily in the work of exploiting and utilizing natural gas, calling on everyone to contribute ideas to overcome the material barrier. The masses also made many creations in this regard. They used reed tubes and old glass tubes to replace plastic tubes and rubber tubes; they used wine jars to replace water-gas separators, reducing the cost by three-quarters; the well casing was reduced from the original two to four inches to four points, and the number of wells drilled per ton of steel pipes increased from ten to thirty to forty. In the development of natural gas irrigation stations, the Hongqiao Commune created a combination of local and foreign methods, using engines to drive waterwheels, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient water pumps. Mobilizing communes to support each other and adjusting the use of equipment and materials from various units also played a certain role in overcoming the difficulty of lacking materials.

The exploitation and utilization of natural gas requires a certain number of professional drilling teams and amateur drilling personnel. During the Great Leap Forward, more labor was needed in all aspects, resulting in a shortage of labor. Solving this problem is a prerequisite for the great development of natural gas. In the early stage of exploitation and utilization of natural gas in 1958, there were only a dozen natural gas workers in the county. These people were still drawn from organs, factories, and enterprises. Due to the shortage of labor, comprehensive exploration was affected to a certain extent. This problem was solved with the establishment of rural people's communes. Under the principle of overall planning and reasonable allocation of labor, county communes established professional drilling teams. Now there are three county-owned professional drilling teams with more than thirty people, and more than twenty commune-run amateur drilling teams in the form of both workers and farmers, with a total of more than two hundred people.

With the increasing development of the work of utilizing natural gas, we have correspondingly established professional management institutions, established natural gas companies, established a charging system, and implemented enterprise management. However, the exploitation and utilization of natural gas is a new task, especially as it is currently in its nascent stage, with more investment in equipment and materials, and it cannot be self-sufficient for the time being. In this situation, the county party committee provided timely economic support.

However, because we have not grasped this work tightly enough, the momentum of the mass movement is not strong enough, and there are still some ideas of greed and blind faith in foreign things, some things that could be done better have not been done better.

1960 is a year of continued leap forward. We will continue to earnestly implement the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Under the leadership of the higher-level Party committee, we will guard against arrogance and impetuosity, make persistent efforts, work hard and strive for greater, better, and more comprehensive leaps forward in the development and utilization of natural gas.

    我们是怎样利用天然气的
    中共川沙县委书记　谷必成
    上海市郊川沙县是一个冲积平原，在地面下层积有层层厚薄不等的腐朽有机淤泥，蕴藏着丰富的可燃性气体即天然气。
    1958年川沙人民在党的社会主义建设总路线光辉照耀下，随着全国工农业生产的全面大跃进，在群众性的热火朝天的革命运动中，破除迷信，解放思想，发扬了敢想敢说敢作的共产主义风格，大胆地开发利用了天然气。特别是农村人民公社的建立，给利用天然气创造了良好的条件。一年多来，我们依靠了全县人民苦干实干巧干，全县共打了气井一千二百零五口，先后利用的有六百二十五口，到1959年底保持正常利用的有一百九十六口，这些井可日产天然气十万立方米。这些天然气，如果用来开动机器，可以发动二万马力，一个月可以节约煤四千八百吨或柴草十四万四千担。目前把天然气利用在工业方面的有发电、冲电瓶、开机器、烧砖瓦、制炭黑等；用在农副业方面的有开拖拉机、机械灌溉、煮饲料和农副产品加工等；用在生活方面的有烧饭、照明、取暖等；用在交通方面的有开汽车等。天然气在发电站和拖拉机上的应用，为农业加速实现机械化、电气化提供了十分有利的条件。
    一年多来，我们在开发利用天然气过程中，先后破了思想、技术、材料、劳力、资金五大关。川沙县天然气运动步步深入，步步提高，是和我们具体解决这些问题分不开的。
    在开发利用天然气的过程中，始终贯穿着先进和落后两种思想的斗争。我们通过加强领导，坚持政治挂帅，在不同时期先后克服了迷信畏难、右倾松劲等各种思想倾向。自1958年4月我们参观了南京和广东人工沼气以后，就在本县城镇等地进行试验，同时在龙王庙利用天然气露头气苗进行钻探，都没有效益；接着又花了一个多月连续钻探二百次，也因气层分布不明而失败。当时一些人便乘机大泼冷水，某些天然气工作人员也产生了一种悲观情绪。当时县委针对这种思想，在组织上加强领导，成立了天然气指挥部。各公社相应建立了天然气办公室，并组织到南汇、奉贤县和七一公社等地区参观学习利用沼气的先进经验。从这些典型中我们得到了启发，并提出“人家能搞，为什么我们不能搞”的问题进行辩论，从而解放了思想，树立了信心。领导部门同时还采取同干部、群众相结合的方法，坚持试验，终于在原勤俭社挖成了一口天然气井。县委立即抓住这面旗帜，召开现场会议组织推广。后来在永乐、王港、龚路等地区相继打出了压力在五十五磅的大气井。一个接着一个的事实，更有力地解放了人们的思想。通过初期的摸索，我们已摸到了气层分布情况，大搞天然气运动就蓬勃开展起来了。不到两个月，正常利用的气井就有三十多口，7月又跃进到一百五十多口，走上了全面大发展道路。
    开发利用天然气是一门新的工作，我们缺乏经验。起初由于依靠群众的思想不十分明确，把希望寄托在少数专业打井人员身上，花了几个月钻井二百多口，但探气的效益不大。从这里我们得到了一个深刻的教训：必须依靠群众，把困难向群众交代。我们向群众提出“要挖地下气，必须大破钻头关”的口号。经过人人闹革新，个个搞创造，在很短时间里，活络钻头、尖齿形钻头等十余种能够取出土样和探气的钻头都创造出来了。使用这些新工具以后，打井效率显著提高，开始打一口井要十个人，三、四天，现在只要六个人，四、五个小时。闯过了上面这些关口后，接着又遇到了流沙淤塞关，由于流沙的淤塞，气井的寿命不长。群众在我们及时提出“大破流沙层，保气井长寿”口号鼓舞下，又创造了铁制、竹制、铁丝和包棕皮等多种滤管，初步解决了流沙淤塞问题，使气井寿命由一个月延长到一年多。
    开采利用天然气要有一定的器材、设备，可是这些东西我们是缺乏的。克服这项困难的办法是在开采利用天然气工作中，坚决贯彻了以土代洋、土洋结合的原则和勤俭办一切事业的方针，号召人人献计，攻破材料关。群众在这方面的创造也是很多的。他们利用芦管、旧玻璃管代替了塑料管、橡皮管；利用酒甏代替了水气分离器，成本降低了四分之三；打井套管由原来用二寸至四寸的，减少到四分，由原来每吨钢管打井十个增加到三十至四十个。在发展天然气灌溉站中，虹桥公社创造了土洋结合以引擎带动水车，克服了水泵不足的困难。发动各公社相互支援，调剂使用各单位的器材设备，对克服缺少材料的困难也起了一定的作用。
    开发利用天然气需要一定数量的专业打井队伍和业余打井人员。大跃进中各方面都需要更多的劳力，因而出现了劳动力不足的情况。解决这一问题，是天然气能否大发展的一个前提。在1958年开采利用天然气初期，全县只有十几个天然气工作人员。这些人还是从机关、工厂、企业单位抽来的。由于劳动力的不足，全面开探受到一定影响。这个问题随着农村人民公社的建立而解决了。在统筹兼顾、合理安排劳力的原则下，县社建立了专业打井队伍。现在已有县属专业打井队三个，人员三十多个，公社亦工亦农形式的业余打井队二十多个，共二百多人。
    随着利用天然气工作的日益发展，我们相应地建立了专业管理机构，成立了天然气公司，建立收费制度，实行企业化管理。但是，天然气的开采利用是一项新的工作，特别是当前还处在新生阶段，器材设备投资较多，一时还不能自给自足。在这种情况下，县委及时地在经济上予以支持。
    但是，由于我们在这项工作上抓得还不够紧，群众运动的声势还不大，还有某些贪大求洋的思想，因此有些可以办得更好的事，我们还没有办得更好。
    1960年是继续跃进的一年，我们将继续认真地贯彻党的八届八中全会决议，在上级党的领导下，戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，大干特干，争取在天然气开发利用方面得到更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
