    Road
    Worker at Beijing People's Printing Factory, Gao Changfu
    This road is so smooth,
    Poplars and willows line both sides;
    A car speeds by like a flying arrow,
    ??? The horn honks incessantly.
    The driver glances at his master,
    Seeing two teardrops on his face,
    "Master, this is a glorious thing,
    Why don't you like being sent for recuperation?"
    Like mixing sugar and Coptis chinensis in a pot,
    The master feels both bitter and sweet;
    He trembles, unable to speak,
    Tears fall on his chest, covered with medals.
    Ten years ago, dark clouds pressed down from the sky,
    Ten years ago, the ground was pitch black,
    As if living on a desolate Iceland,
    Humanity was filled with hunger and poverty.
    He, a worthless coolie,
    A rickshaw was his entire property;
    He pulled ladies and young masters in silk and satin,
    Panting and sighing, rushing on this road.
    Sweat flowed from his face into his mouth,
    Burning sparks flew before his eyes;
    How much sweat has this road absorbed from him,
    How many pairs of shoe soles has this road worn through!
    He still remembers clearly,
    That spring after the rain;
    He pulled a foreigner to see the mountains and enjoy the water,
    Who not only didn't pay the fare but also kicked him hard.
    He gripped the thin rickshaw handle with both hands,
    And bitterly lamented to the heavens:
    "What kind of world is this?
    People have no basic human rights!"
    ?? The horn awakens deep memories,
    He feels like he's traveled through hell;
    When he looks up at the window,
    A flood of happiness overwhelms his heart.
    Rows of chimneys spew white mist,
    The long arms of high-voltage lines stretch to the sky,
    Skyscrapers soar into the clouds,
    Magnificent palaces are situated in the human world.
    The master wipes away the bittersweet tears,
    Joyful spring blossoms bloom on his face;
    Right on this road to recuperation,
    His heart has already flown back to the roaring machines in the workshop!

    路
    北京人民印刷厂工人  高长福
    这条路多平坦，
    白杨绿柳排两边；
    一辆轿车快如飞，
    ???喇叭不停地叫唤。
    司机望了师傅一眼，
    见他脸上挂着两颗泪点，
    “师傅，这是光荣的事啊，
    送你去休养怎倒不喜欢？”
    糖和黄连一锅炒，
    师傅心里又苦又甜；
    他颤动着嘴唇说不出话，
    泪珠落在挂满奖章的胸前。
    十年前，天上是压顶的乌云，
    十年前，地下是漆黑一片，
    仿佛生在荒凉的冰岛，
    人间尽是饥饿贫寒。
    他，一个不值钱的苦力，
    一辆洋车是他的全部家产；
    他拉着穿绫罗的小姐少爷，
    在这条路上奔驰喘叹。
    汗水从脸上流进嘴里，
    烧辣的眼前火花飞溅；
    这条路渗下他多少汗水，
    这条路把他多少双鞋底磨穿！
    他还记得清清楚楚，
    那一个雨后的春天；
    他拉一个洋人去观山赏水，
    不给车费还狠狠踢了一阵脚尖。
    他双手握攥着细了的车把，
    对着苍天愤愤哀叹：
    “这是什么人间世界啊？
    人，没有起码的人权！”
    ??的喇叭惊醒深沉的回忆，
    他像在地狱里旅行了一遍；
    当他仰首向着窗外望去，
    幸福的激流在他心里泛滥。
    林立的烟囱喷吐着白雾，
    高压线的长臂伸向天边，
    一幢幢高楼耸入云峰，
    辉煌的宫殿座落在人间。
    师傅擦去甘苦的泪水，
    欣喜的脸上春花灿烂；
    就在这条去休养的路上，
    他的心早飞回马达轰鸣的车间！
