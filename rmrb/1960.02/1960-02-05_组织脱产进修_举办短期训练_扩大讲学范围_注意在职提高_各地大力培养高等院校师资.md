Xinhua News Agency, 4th: In the past year, all regions have adopted various effective measures to improve the teaching and scientific research level of teachers in colleges and universities, and have achieved great results.

    Organizing teachers for off-the-job training is an effective measure to cultivate teachers and improve teaching quality. Since last year, in order to adapt to the development of higher education and the new situation of the rapid expansion of the teaching staff, the education departments have further strengthened this work, designating some schools (or some majors and courses) with better conditions such as Tsinghua University and Peking University to cultivate teachers with higher levels for the whole country. These schools accepted more than 1,000 training teachers last year. Other relevant departments of the Central Government and various regions also generally attach importance to the work of organizing teacher training. Many well-established old schools are training teachers for brother schools, especially for newly built institutions. The Henan Provincial Higher Education Bureau has formulated a plan for teacher training in colleges and universities throughout the province, designating Zhengzhou University, Henan Agricultural College, and Kaifeng Normal College as the base points for training teachers for newly built colleges and universities, responsible for accepting teacher training from newly built colleges and universities throughout the province; 32 colleges and universities in the province have selected 199 teachers to go out for further study. The number of training teachers accepted by Beijing Forestry College last year exceeded the total number of training teachers accepted in the four years from 1954 to 1958.

    All schools attach great importance to the work of accepting training teachers. Leading cadres of Beijing Mining College personally reviewed the work plan for accepting training teachers, and promptly studied and solved important issues. The departments and teaching and research groups have all appointed special personnel to be responsible for the overall organization and leadership of this work. Universities such as Sichuan University and Fudan University have designated special personnel to be responsible for guiding training teachers, providing comprehensive assistance in business training, and making specific arrangements for political and business learning, scientific research, and production labor according to the purpose and requirements of training. In order to further ensure that training teachers can return to school on time to take on teaching work, the East China Textile Engineering Institute has established special groups in each department to arrange for training teachers to spend a certain amount of time on teaching work such as tutoring small classes, answering questions, guiding laboratory courses, and grading homework; in the later stages of the training, large class lectures are also arranged for training teachers, so that training teachers can be trained in practice and improve their teaching ability.

    Using vacations to hold short-term training classes is also an effective way to train teachers. During the summer vacation last year, many provinces, cities, and autonomous regions held short-term training classes with various contents, hiring teachers who have expertise in a certain subject and have rich teaching experience to give lectures, helping the teachers who are studying to solve some difficult problems in the teaching work of this course. The Hubei Provincial Higher Education Department entrusted Wuhan University and other three schools to open ten summer refresher courses in advanced algebra, general physics, literary theory, etc., to solve the difficulties in opening some courses in newly built colleges and universities; more than 160 students who participated in the study generally mastered the basic content of the refresher courses more systematically after more than a month of study, and learned teaching methods to varying degrees, and basically could teach this course after returning to school.

    In 1959, the Ministry of Education also expanded the scope of expert lectures, allowing more people to have the opportunity to learn from Soviet experts. For example, during the special lectures given by Soviet building materials expert Rebiere at Tsinghua University, about 120 people from more than 50 schools and units across the country often participated in the audience, which not only improved the teaching business ability of the teachers who attended the lectures, but also improved their scientific level. When Guo Luowo Fsky, an expert in "ultra-high frequency electronics" at Tsinghua University, was invited to lecture at Nanjing Institute of Technology, 134 people from 24 schools and relevant units such as Xi'an Jiaotong University, Harbin Institute of Technology, Sichuan University, and Fudan University went to listen.

    In addition, schools in various regions generally pay attention to the on-the-job training and improvement of teachers. Many schools such as Tsinghua University, Peking University, Fudan University, and Xi'an Jiaotong University have formulated long-term plans for training teachers. On the one hand, they organize on-the-job teachers to improve their teaching business level through completing teaching work and carrying out scientific research; at the same time, they also organize teachers to conduct systematic theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism and frequent current affairs policy study, and organize teachers to regularly participate in labor exercises in a planned way, comprehensively helping teachers improve their political level. Schools in various regions also pay great attention to giving play to the enthusiasm of veteran teachers in training young teachers, and organizing young teachers to learn the expertise of veteran teachers.

    组织脱产进修　举办短期训练　扩大讲学范围　注意在职提高
    各地大力培养高等院校师资
    新华社4日讯　在过去一年中，各地采取各种有效措施，提高高等学校教师的教学和科学研究水平，获得很大成绩。
    组织教师脱产进修，是培养师资、提高教学质量的一项有效措施。去年以来，为适应高等教育事业的发展和教师队伍迅速扩大的新形势，教育部门进一步加强这一工作，指定清华大学、北京大学等部分条件较好的学校（或某些专业、课程），为全国培养水平较高的教师。这些学校去年共接受了进修教师一千多人。中央其他有关部门和各地区也普遍重视组织教师进修的工作，许多基础较好的老校，为兄弟学校——特别是为新建院校培养师资。河南省高教局制定了全省高等学校教师进修的计划，指定郑州大学、河南农学院、开封师范学院等五所高等学校为培养新建院校师资的基点，负责接受全省新建院校的教师进修；全省并有三十二所高等学校选送了一百九十九名教师外出进修。北京林学院去年一年接受的进修教师，超过1954年至1958年四年中接受进修教师人数的总和。
    各校对接受进修教师的工作都十分重视。北京矿业学院领导干部亲自审查接受进修教师的工作计划，及时研究解决有关的重要问题。院、系、教研组都确定了专人负责，全面组织领导这一工作。四川、复旦等大学对进修教师指定了专人负责指导，在业务进修方面给予全面的帮助，根据进修目的和要求对政治、业务学习、科学研究和生产劳动进行了具体安排。华东纺织工学院为了进一步保证进修教师能按期回校担任教学工作，各系成立专门小组，为进修教师安排一定时间担任小班辅导、答疑、实验课指导、批改作业等教学工作；在进修到一定阶段还为进修教师安排了大班讲课，使进修教师能在实践中得到锻炼，提高教学工作的能力。
    利用假期举办短期讲习班，也是培养训练师资的有效办法。去年暑假期间，许多省、市、自治区分别举办了各种内容的短期讲习班，聘请对某门学科有专长而又有丰富教学经验的教师来主讲，帮助学习的教师解决这一门课程教学工作中的一些困难问题。湖北省高教厅委托武汉大学等三校开办了高等代数、普通物理、文艺理论等十个暑期进修班，解决新建院校部分课程的开课困难；参加学习的一百六十多个学员，经过一个多月的学习，一般都比较系统地掌握了进修课程的基本内容，在不同程度上学习了教学法，回校后基本上能讲授这门课程。
    1959年中，教育部还扩大专家讲学范围，使更多的人有机会向苏联专家学习。如苏联建筑材料专家雷比耶夫在清华大学讲学期间开设的专题讲座，经常有全国各地有关的五十多个学校和单位约一百二十人参加旁听，不仅提高了听讲教师的教学业务能力，而且提高了他们的科学水平。清华大学“超高频电子学”专家郭洛沃?夫斯基应邀去南京工学院讲学时，前往旁听的有西安交通大学、哈尔滨工业大学、四川大学、复旦大学等二十四个学校和有关单位，共一百三十四人。
    此外，各地学校普遍注意了教师的在职培养和提高。清华大学、北京大学、复旦大学、西安交通大学等许多学校，都制定了培养师资的长远规划，一方面组织在职教师通过完成教学工作和开展科学研究的过程来提高教学业务水平；同时还组织教师进行马克思列宁主义的系统理论学习和经常的时事政策学习，有计划地组织教师定期参加劳动锻炼，全面地帮助教师提高政治水平。各地学校还十分注意发挥老教师培养青年教师的积极性，组织青年教师学习老教师的专长。
