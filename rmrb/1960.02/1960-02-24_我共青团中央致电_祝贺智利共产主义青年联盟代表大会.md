Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China today sent a telegram to the Communist Youth Union of Chile, warmly congratulating them on the convening of the Fourth Congress of the Communist Youth Union of Chile.

The telegram said: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Chile, the Communist Youth Union of Chile unites the broad masses of young people and has consistently carried out heroic struggles against imperialism, in defense of peace and national independence, and for democracy and the vital rights of young people." The telegram wished the Communist Youth Union of Chile greater achievements in future struggles. The telegram pointed out that in the current international situation where the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind, American imperialism has to put on some peaceful appearances in an attempt to paralyze the people's fighting will. On the other hand, it is still stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations, actively strengthening military blocs, reviving West German and Japanese militarism, and doing everything possible to obstruct and interfere with the struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to win and safeguard national independence and democratic freedom. The telegram said, "Therefore, only by further strengthening unity, heightening vigilance, constantly exposing the imperialists' conspiracies and tricks, and persisting in the struggle can the peace, national independence, and human progress be reliably guaranteed for all peace-loving people and youth around the world."

    我共青团中央致电
    祝贺智利共产主义青年联盟代表大会
    新华社22日讯　中国共产主义青年团中央委员会今天打电报给智利共产主义青年联盟，热烈祝贺智利共产主义青年联盟第四届代表大会的召开。
    电报说：“智利共产主义青年联盟在智利共产党领导下，团结着广大青年，一贯为反对帝国主义、维护和平和民族独立、争取民主和青年切身权利而进行了英勇的斗争”。电报预祝智利共产主义青年联盟在将来的斗争中取得更大的成就。电报指出，在目前东风继续压倒西风的国际形势下，美国帝国主义不得不装出些和平姿态，企图麻痹人民的斗志，另一方面它仍然加紧扩军备战，积极加强军事集团，复活西德和日本军国主义，千方百计阻挠和干涉亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民争取和维护民族独立和民主自由的斗争。电报说，“因此，全世界爱好和平的人民和青年只有进一步加强团结，提高警惕，不断揭露帝国主义的阴谋诡计，坚持斗争，才能使和平、民族独立和人类进步事业获得可靠的保证。”
