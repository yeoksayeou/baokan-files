"Jiangdong" Style
	Chu An	Tong Yun  You Hong	You Yan

	One morning in early 1960, as the rising sun shone upon the earth, the Jiangdong Machinery Factory, known for its revolutionary spirit of "great ambition and starting from scratch," and comprised mainly of heroes from the Korean People's Army, was once again immersed in a sea of jubilation.

	The sounds of gongs and drums, and firecrackers, shook the heavens and the earth. Heroes emerged from every workshop, carrying celebratory reports, and rushed toward the Party committee. The large, still-wet characters on the leading celebratory report, "C620 lathe bed production increased from two to three per day," glittered in the sunlight!

	The Party committee secretary arrived, smiling excitedly, busy shaking hands with everyone. He stroked the lathe and congratulated the comrades. The sounds of gongs and drums, firecrackers, and applause drowned out his words. People were immersed in ecstasy.

	The Jiangdong volunteer army heroes and workers, they should rejoice to their hearts' content. Last year, with a total output value increase of 138%, they exceeded the state's task, and this year they put forward the ambitious slogan of "sevenfold increase in total output value in one year." And only a few days into the opening of 1960, they fired the first shot for this year's victory. They did not have a full set of large-scale equipment from casting and forging to assembly. All their belongings, except for a few gantry cranes added after returning home, were thirty small lathes brought back from the Korean front. The paint on these lathes had completely peeled off, and some of them would "gasp" if the feed was increased even slightly, and would not turn, but these were now going to produce large batches of high-density, large C620 lathes. Such a big leap forward, how could they not be ecstatic?

	The Jiangdong volunteer army heroes, we fully know their glorious past. On the fiery, smoke-filled Korean front, in the harsh environment where enemy planes dropped batches of bombs around them, they were fearless and tirelessly repaired guns and cannons for the volunteer army. At night, without electric lights, they operated under the dim candlelight. A fitter named Zhang Cunxin, recalling those days, excitedly said: "We missed the motherland so much! As long as we thought about how we defeated the enemy and could participate in peaceful construction, a surge of enthusiasm, a surge of strength, would well up in our hearts!" In 1958, they finally joined the ranks of the motherland's peaceful construction in a triumphant return. They were used to seeing broken walls, bomb craters, and rubble. When they returned to the Jiangnan region of the motherland and saw the rapidly advancing national construction, the poetic and picturesque land, their hearts leaped with joy. A soldier named Su Zhiming told us: "I really wanted to hug everyone, every tree, every chimney, because it was all so lovely!"

	In the summer of 1958, they arrived in Nanchang. With the flowers from the welcomers still in their hands, they asked the leadership to quickly assign them tasks. In a few days, in the suburbs, on a field where the crops had just been harvested, a lonely small thatched shed was erected. Several people in military uniforms came out. The Party committee secretary, the factory director, and several workers walked to this field together.

	"Secretary, when will our factory be built here and start production!" A volunteer army worker asked anxiously.

	"When?" Vice Secretary and Factory Director Kang—the commander who had commanded thousands of soldiers on the battlefield, his bright eyes powerfully surveyed this vast field, and said decisively: "Not when, but immediately! Now construction is just like fighting in Korea, not a minute can be delayed!"

	After a pause, Vice Secretary Kang smiled heartily and patted the soldier's shoulder, saying: "Now the task assigned to us by the higher authorities is no longer to repair gun and cannon parts, but to produce water pumps and lathes. Comrade, participating in the motherland's peaceful construction, this is what we have been looking forward to for so long!"

	Vice Secretary Kang surveyed for a while, his face becoming serious again, and said to the soldier: "Yes! Participating in peaceful construction, how good is that. But now, there are still many difficulties, no equipment, no technology, these all have to be solved through self-reliance. We can't just come back and do nothing but reach out to the higher authorities! Young man, it's time to earn merit again, work hard!..."

	From that day on, the construction site became lively. Without a factory building, they set up army tents. Without dormitories, they rented rooms in hotels. Lacking smelting furnaces, they used old army stoves for cooking and modified them. The number of technicians was unbalanced, so they sent people to support fraternal factories and requested cooperation from other factories....

	The joyful sound of machines rumbled, and products were shipped out of the thatched shed batch after batch. The volunteer army soldiers, as if they had won a victory in Korea, could not restrain the joy in their hearts.

	"Good! We lived in tents in Korea, repaired guns and cannons, and won the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea. We live in thatched sheds here and make lathes to win the victory of construction." The soldiers looked at the leaky shed, looked at those old factories around; tall workshops, rows of bright glass windows, and smiled with pride.

	What noble qualities these people have! In front of such people, they will never be satisfied with their achievements, and they will never be blocked by difficulties. They had just overcome numerous difficulties and produced a batch of hand-operated water pumps and belt lathes, and then they proposed to create the miracle of trial-producing the C620 lathe without modern equipment.

	At that time, to produce the C620 lathe bed, the bed had to be placed in the furnace for heat treatment. Only in this way would it not be scrapped due to deformation. Factories with good equipment conditions use electric furnaces or foreign furnaces built with advanced refractory materials, but they have nothing; what to do? The volunteer army heroes would certainly not be blocked by difficulties, they picked up hoes and swung shovels in the earthen mounds next to the factory. Soil flew everywhere. They laughed and sang, digging out an earthen cave to replace the electric furnace and foreign furnace.

	Volunteer army soldiers! They used this abundant revolutionary drive, this native method, to create a焖fire furnace, and used this native method to overcome thousands of equipment deficiencies for creating the C620 lathe even without modern equipment. After countless days and nights of hard work, on a sunny day in November 1959, the day they had all been waiting for finally arrived. Amidst a burst of applause that shook the entire workshop, the old lathe operator Zhu Baoqing excitedly and skillfully cranked the handle, and the lathe head spun rapidly. Look! The tool bit has engaged, and a purple chip shot out like an arrow, and the gray-black blank immediately shone with dazzling silver light. This declared that they had won.

	Less than two months later, they are now starting to produce them in batches!

	Friends, let us now return to Jiangdong and take another look at the volunteer army soldiers, carrying celebratory reports in the morning sunlight, knocking on gongs and drums, and celebrating wildly around the Party committee secretary! From these sounds of gongs and drums, from these sounds of laughter, can we not feel that the people here are especially lovely? Can we not see how the strong feelings of our six hundred million people, determined to change the poor and blank state of the motherland, are joyously overflowing on the land of the motherland's morning?

    “江东”风格
    楚安　彤云  忧鸿　有延
    1960年初的一天清晨，当一轮朝阳照射在大地上的时候，江东机械厂，这个以富有“雄心大志和白手起家”的革命精神著称的，由朝鲜志愿军的英雄们为骨干组成的机械厂，又沉浸在欢腾的海洋中。
    锣鼓声、鞭炮声，震天动地。从各个车间里涌出来了英雄们，他们抬着喜报，向党委奔去。领头的一张喜报上，“C620车床床身又由日产两台增加到三台”的墨迹未干的大字，在阳光下闪耀！
    党委书记走来了，他兴奋地微笑着，忙着和大家握手，他抚摸着机床，向同志们祝贺。锣鼓声、鞭炮声、掌声，淹没了他的谈话。人们沉浸在狂喜中。
    江东的志愿军英雄们、工人们，他们是应该尽情地欢乐的。去年他们以总产值增长138％，超额完成了国家的任务，今年他们又提出了“总产值一年翻七番”的宏伟口号。而1960年开门才不几天，他们就为今年的胜利打响了第一炮。他们没有从铸锻到装配的全套大型设备，全部家底，除了归国以后添制的几部龙门机床之外，就是由朝鲜前线带回的三十部小型机床，这些机床老得漆都已经全部脱落，有的把进刀量稍微加大一点，就要“喘气”，转也转不动，但就是这些，现在却要成批的生产高密度的庞大的C620车床。如此大的跃进，怎能叫他们不狂喜呢？
    江东的志愿军英雄们，我们完全知道他们光荣的过去。他们在那战火弥漫、烽烟四起的朝鲜前线，在那敌机把成批的炸弹倾泻在他们四周的艰苦环境里，毫不畏惧，不停地为志愿军修理枪炮。夜里没有电灯，他们就在微弱的烛火下操作。一位叫张存新的钳工，现在回想起当时的日子，还兴奋地说：“我们想念祖国想念得慌啊！只要想起我们打垮了敌人，就能参加和平建设，心里就涌上一股热气，一股力量！”1958年他们终于在凯歌声中，参加到祖国和平建设的队伍里来了。他们看惯了断垣残壁、弹坑瓦砾，一回到祖国的江南，看到那正昂首阔步飞跃前进的祖国建设，那如诗如画的大地，他们的心就剧跳起来。一个叫苏志明的战士告诉我们说：“我真恨不得和每一个人，每一株树，每一个烟囱拥抱一下，因为这一切都太可爱了！”
    1958年盛夏，他们来到南昌了。欢迎者的鲜花还握在手里，他们便向领导上请求快些交给任务。没几天，在城郊，一片才收割完庄稼的田野上，一座孤零零的小茅棚支起来了。几个穿着军服的人走了出来。党委书记、厂长和几个工人一起走到这片田野上。
    “书记同志，要等到什么时候，在这里才能建起我们的厂房，开始生产啊！”一个志愿军工人焦急地问。
    “什么时候？”康副书记兼厂长——这位在战场上指挥过成千战士的指挥员，那炯炯有神的眼睛，威武地巡视着这片辽阔的田野，斩钉截铁地说：“不是什么时候，而是马上！现在建设也和朝鲜打仗一样，一分钟也不能迟延！”
    停了一会康副书记又一面爽朗地笑着，一面拍着那个战士的肩膀说：“现在上级交给我们的任务再不是修理枪炮零件，而是生产水泵、生产车床。同志，参加祖国的和平建设，这是我们盼望了多少时候的事呵！”
    康副书记巡视了一阵，脸孔又严肃起来，对着那个战士说：“是呀！参加和平建设，这多好。但是现在，困难可还是不少哇，没有设备，没有技术，这些都得自力更生来解决，可不能一回国什么事都没做，就光伸手向上级要呵！小伙子，又是立功的时候了，好好地干吧！……”
    从这天以后，工地上便热闹起来了，没有厂房便支起了行军帐篷，没有宿舍便租旅馆的房子住，缺少化铁炉，便用烧饭用的旧行军灶改装，机床小了就把两台合起来车，技术人员不平衡，就一面派人去支援兄弟厂，一面又请求别厂合作……。
    隆隆地响起了机器的欢腾声，产品一批一批地由茅棚里运出去，志愿军的战士们，也像在朝鲜打了胜仗一样，抑制不住内心的欢乐。
    “好哇！咱们在朝鲜住帐篷、修枪炮，赢得抗美援朝的胜利，在这儿住茅棚，造机床，要赢得建设的胜利。”战士们望望四面透风的破棚子，望望四周围那些老厂子；一幢幢高耸的车间，一排排明亮的玻璃窗，自豪地笑不住口。
    这是具有多么高贵品质的人啊！在这种人面前，永远不会满足自己的成绩，永远不会被困难拦住。他们刚克服重重困难，生产了一批手摇水泵和皮带车床，接着又提出了要在没有现代设备的基础上，创造试制C620车床的奇迹。
    当时生产C620车床床身，必须把床身放在炉子里进行热处理。只有这样，才不会因为变形而报废。设备条件好的工厂，不是用电炉，便是用高级耐火材料筑成的洋炉子，而他们却是什么也没有呵；怎么办？志愿军的英雄当然不会被困难拦住，他们在厂房旁的土堆中，扬起锄头，挥动铁锹，挖了起来。土块四处飞扬。他们笑着唱着，挖出了一个土穴，用这代替了电炉和洋炉子。
    志愿军的战士啊！他们就是用这种充沛的革命干劲，用这种土办法，创造了一个焖火炉，用这种土办法，为没有现代化设备也要创造C620车床克服了千万件设备不足的困难。经过多少个日日夜夜的奋战，在1959年11月一个阳光闪烁的日子里，这个大家日夜盼望的试车的日子终于来到了。在一阵震撼全车间的掌声中，老车工朱宝清兴奋而熟练地摇动了摇把，车头飞转。看！吃刀了，一条紫色的切屑像箭一样飞射出来，灰黑的毛坯立刻闪耀出耀眼的银光。这就宣告，他们胜利了。
    时间还不到两个月，现在他们就成批的开始生产了！
    朋友们，现在我们再回到江东来，再来看看志愿军的战士们，在清晨的阳光照耀下，抬着喜报，敲锣打鼓的围着党委书记狂欢的情景吧！从这些锣鼓声中，欢笑声中，我们能不觉得这里的人特别可爱吗？能不看到，我国六亿人民决心改变祖国一穷二白面貌的强烈感情，是如何欢腾地洋溢在祖国早晨的大地上吗？　（原载江西日报）
