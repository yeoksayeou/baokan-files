Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: More than five hundred and forty people from the cultural circles of the capital today published a letter of protest against the American imperialists' conspiracy to plunder our precious cultural relics. The full text is as follows:

	We express our utmost indignation and solemnly condemn the new crime of American imperialism in attempting to plunder our precious cultural relics. We firmly support the serious warning and statement issued by the Ministry of Culture to the American government. We unanimously believe that American imperialism is not only an "expert" in aggression but also an "expert" in theft. No matter what name or means it uses, it is only to achieve its criminal purposes of aggression and plunder. This shameless new activity of American imperialism is a continuation and development of a series of conspiracies it has engaged in over the years to plunder our cultural relics. Ever since the Chiang Kai-shek clique stole these cultural relics to Taiwan, American imperialists have tried every means to plunder them to the United States. In 1954, they colluded with the traitor Hu Shih in an attempt to loot two hundred precious cultural relics to the United States. In 1955, they went even further and, in the name of Horace Jayne, deputy director of the Philadelphia Museum in the United States, conspired to plunder all of our cultural relics in Taiwan by means of a "long-term loan." Jayne shamelessly declared that the United States' removal of these cultural relics was "an unavoidable international obligation." In 1958, Stanford University in the United States came forward, intending to transport a batch of precious cultural relics under the pretext of a so-called commercial loan, and said: "If it can be done" it could arouse "great goodwill" in the United States. Before and after this, American so-called "archaeologists," "collectors," and some aggressive robber-like civil and military officials flocked to Taiwan to "visit" antiques and secretly carry out activities. After this series of conspiracies, the American imperialists simply abandoned the clandestine activities of these so-called "academic groups" and openly sent the US State Department forward, under the guise of "exhibitions," and with the US President as "patron," dispatched so-called "museum experts" to Taiwan to select and transport these precious cultural relics to the United States by US Navy warships. This blatant and shameless act of plunder completely exposes the faces of American imperialist aggressors and their ambitions to plunder the world's wealth before the people of the world. This will not only make our 650 million people see more clearly the aggressive nature of American imperialism but also make the people of the world recognize the banditry of American imperialism.

	We firmly support the government's solemn statement. The batch of precious cultural relics shipped to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek clique are the crystallization of the cultural arts of our country's thousands of years of history, and also our country's valuable scientific research materials. The sovereignty belongs to our 650 million people. The Chiang Kai-shek clique, as Chinese people, only bears the responsibility of properly protecting them for their eventual return to the motherland along with the territory of Taiwan, and has no right to "lend" them to the United States without authorization. Therefore, any draft agreement signed in the United States with the Chiang Kai-shek clique by any means is of course invalid. The United States not only has no right to dispose of this batch of cultural relics belonging to the entire people of the People's Republic of China, but we must also recover the cultural relics that were plundered and taken to the United States in the past by various despicable means. We warn American imperialists to immediately stop this extremely shameless act of robbery that is exposed to the people of the world.

	Our patriotic compatriots in Taiwan should also rise up and resolutely stop the realization of this conspiracy.

	Taiwan is our country's territory, we must liberate Taiwan!

	Our cultural relics in Taiwan must be returned to the motherland with the liberation of Taiwan. Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Shen Yanbing, Zhang Xiruo, Qian Junrui, Xia Yan, Qi Yanming, Xu Guangping, Deng Tuo, Wu Han, Hu Yuzhi, Ding Xilin, Tao Menghe, Chen Yuan, Fan Wenlan, Jian Bozan, Zhang Shizhao, Liang Sicheng, Ye Shengtao, Wang Yeqiu, Zhu Qiqian, Xu Bingchang, Wu Zuoren, Yang Zhongjian, Li Linyu, Chen Banding, Feng Youlan, Huang Wenbi, Gu Jiegang, Pu Xuezhai, Guo Baojun, Yin Da, Deng Yizhe, Liu Kaiqu, Cai Ruohong, Chang Shuhong, Zhao Wanli, Xia Nai, Wu Zhongchao, Ye Qianyu, Zuo Gong, Han Shouxuan, Tang Lan, etc. five hundred and forty-six people.

### 谴责美国图谋劫夺我国文物的罪行  首都文化界五百四十多人发表抗议书

    谴责美国图谋劫夺我国文物的罪行
    首都文化界五百四十多人发表抗议书
    新华社22日讯　首都文化界人士五百四十六人今天发表了对美国帝国主义阴谋劫夺我国在台湾珍贵文物的抗议书，全文如下：
    我们以无比的忿怒严正谴责美帝国主义图谋劫夺我国珍贵文物的新罪行，我们坚决拥护文化部对美国政府所提出的严重警告和声明。我们一致认为：美帝国主义不仅是侵略“能手”，也是盗窃“能手”，无论它是用何种名义，何种手段，无非是达到它的侵略和掠夺的罪恶目的。美帝国主义这一无耻的新活动，是它几年来一系列企图掠夺我国文物阴谋活动的继续和发展。自从蒋介石集团把这些文物盗运台湾以后，美帝国主义者就千方百计企图把它劫夺到美国，1954年它们就与卖国贼胡适进行勾结活动，企图把两百件珍贵文物劫运美国；1955年更进一步用美国费城博物馆副馆长霍雷斯·杰尼的名义，阴谋以“长期出借”的方式，把我存在台湾的文物，全部加以劫夺，杰尼并且无耻地声言，美国运走这批文物“是一种不可逃避的国际义务”；1958年又由美国史丹福大学出面，打算以所谓商借名义，运走一批珍贵文物，并说：“假如能做成”可以引起美国的“极大好感”。在此前后，美国的所谓“考古家”、“收藏家”和一些侵略强盗——文武官员，都纷纷到台湾“参观”古物，并暗中进行活动。这一系列的阴谋活动之后，现在美帝国主义者索性把这些所谓“学术团体”的鬼祟活动抛开，竟然公开由美国国务院出面，假借“展览会”为名，并将由美国总统为“赞助人”，由美国派遣所谓“博物馆专家”到台湾进行挑选，将这批珍贵文物用美国海军军舰运送去美。这种露骨的无耻的劫夺行为，就把美帝国主义侵略者的面目和掠夺世界财富的野心在世界人民面前彻底暴露无遗了。这不仅是使我六亿五千万人民更加看清楚美帝国主义的侵略本质，也将使世界人民认清美帝国主义的强盗行径。
    我们坚决拥护政府的严正声明。蒋介石集团所运往台湾的这批珍贵文物，是我国数千年悠久历史中的文化艺术结晶，也是我国的宝贵的科学研究材料，其主权属于我六亿五千万人民所共有，蒋介石集团作为中国人来说，只负有妥善保护将来随同台湾领土一同归回祖国的责任，而没有私自“出借”给美国的权利，因之无论在美国用任何手段与蒋介石集团签定的任何草约，当然无效。美国不仅无权处理这批属于我中华人民共和国全民财富的文物，就是过去用各种卑鄙手段劫夺去美的文物，我们也一定要追回。我们警告美帝国主义者，立即停止这一暴露在全世界人民面前的极端无耻的盗劫行为。
    我台湾的爱国同胞也应该起来坚决制止这一阴谋的实现。
    台湾是我国的领土，我们一定要解放台湾！
    我们在台湾的文物，一定要随着台湾的解放而归还祖国。郭沫若、黄炎培、陈叔通、沈雁冰、张奚若、钱俊瑞、夏　衍、齐燕铭、许广平、邓　拓、吴　晗、胡愈之、丁西林、陶孟和、陈　垣、范文澜、剪伯赞、章士钊、梁思成、叶圣陶、王冶秋、朱启钤、徐炳昶、吴作人、杨钟健、李麟玉、陈半丁、冯友兰、黄文弼、顾颉刚、溥雪斋、郭宝钧、尹　达、邓以蛰、刘开渠、蔡若虹、常书鸿、赵万里、夏
　鼐、吴仲超、叶浅予、左　恭、韩寿萱、唐兰等五百四十六人。
