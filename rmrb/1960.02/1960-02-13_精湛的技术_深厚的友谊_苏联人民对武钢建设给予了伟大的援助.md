Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 12th: Under the comprehensive assistance of the Soviet Union, Wuhan Iron and Steel, a world-class modern large-scale iron and steel complex, has not only been built quickly, but also well. Its high-speed construction is a victory for cooperation between China and the Soviet Union.

As early as the beginning of 1952, when the Party and the state decided to build a large-scale iron and steel complex in the Wuhan area, the Soviet Union provided China with great assistance in terms of geological surveying, site selection, and engineering design. When Wuhan Iron and Steel entered a period of large-scale construction, especially after the emergence of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, to meet the needs of high-speed engineering construction, this friendly assistance became even more prominent and moving. In the past two years, all projects of Wuhan Iron and Steel have been required to be completed ahead of schedule. The relevant Soviet design departments responsible for the design have tried every means to rush the design work for Wuhan Iron and Steel, so that the drawings were delivered in advance, ensuring the smooth progress of the project ahead of schedule. Hundreds of Soviet factories that undertook the manufacture of equipment for Wuhan Iron and Steel heard that Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 1 blast furnace was to be completed and produce iron ahead of schedule, and temporarily put down their own domestic equipment manufacturing tasks to rush the equipment for Wuhan Iron and Steel, and launched a labor competition for this. After many equipment were manufactured, they were sent to China as quickly as possible.

The Soviet Union has successively sent 156 outstanding experts to help with the construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel. They not only brought superb technology and rich construction experience, but also brought the profound friendship of the Soviet people. Over the past few years, Soviet experts have put forward more than 5,700 major suggestions, and have helped solve many complex technical problems through on-site guidance, special lectures, and question answering, and have trained a large number of cadres for our country. Savitsky and Badurov, the leaders of the Soviet expert group, are both over sixty years old, but regardless of the scorching heat or severe cold, they insist on going deep into the construction site to guide construction and production. During the construction of the No. 1 blast furnace, the furnace building expert Frezhkov personally crawled into the sultry enclosure to give workers a demonstration. When each main project approached completion and was put into production, Soviet experts often worked hard with Chinese workers, even staying on site day and night, to guide the trial operation and acceptance of new equipment.

Soviet experts have helped the builders of Wuhan Iron and Steel to fully implement the construction policy of more, faster, better, and more economical in many ways. According to the suggestion of Badurov, the leader of the expert group, Wuhan Iron and Steel successively built and put into production three open-hearth furnaces before it had a mixer furnace, producing a large amount of steel for the country several months in advance. In the construction of the steelmaking plant, Soviet design supervision expert Matolsky and civil engineering expert Khachiyan considered technical permissibility and economic rationality, and combined them with China's specific conditions to support the modification of the design and save a large amount of investment.

Soviet experts were meticulous about the quality of every project of Wuhan Iron and Steel and were responsible to the end. When pouring the foundation of the No. 1 blast furnace, Savitsky, the leader of the expert group, although suffering from severe arthritis, still climbed into the foundation pit at a high temperature of 38 degrees time and time again to check the quality of the concrete pouring.

During the construction of the steelmaking plant, expert Chelioshin inspected the construction site several times a day, using iron sheets and matchsticks as tools to carefully check the quality of bricklaying. If he found that the mortar joints were too wide and did not meet the design requirements, he would work with Chinese employees to find ways to remedy them. The quality of the main projects such as blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and coke ovens that have been built in Wuhan Iron and Steel have all been rated as excellent.

    精湛的技术　深厚的友谊
    苏联人民对武钢建设给予了伟大的援助
    新华社武汉12日电　在苏联的全面援助下，武钢这座世界上第一流的现代化大型钢铁联合企业，不仅建设得快，而且建设得好。它的建设的高速度进行，是中苏两国合作的胜利。
    远在1952年初，当党和国家确定在武汉地区建设大型钢铁联合企业以后，苏联就从地质勘察、厂址选择和工程设计等方面，给予我国以伟大的援助。当武钢进入大规模施工时期，特别是在1958年大跃进的形势出现以后，适应工程高速度建设的需要，这种友谊的援助就更加突出，更加令人感动。近两年来，武钢各项工程都要求提前完成。承担设计的苏联有关设计部门，千方百计地为武钢赶工设计，使图纸提前送到，保证了工程的提前顺利进行。为武钢承制设备的几百个苏联工厂听说武钢一号高炉要提前建成出铁，都暂时压下本国的设备制作任务，提前为武钢赶制设备，并为此展开了劳动竞赛。很多设备制成以后，都以尽快的速度发送到我国。
    苏联已经先后派来一百五十六位优秀专家，帮助武钢的建设。他们不仅带来了精湛的技术和丰富的建设经验，而且带来了苏联人民的深厚友谊。几年来，苏联专家提出了五千七百多项重大建议，并通过现场指导、专题讲课、问题解答等方式，帮助解决了许多复杂的技术问题，为我国培养了大批干部。苏联专家组长萨维斯基和巴杜洛夫，都是六十多岁的老人，但是他们不管酷热或是严寒，坚持深入现场，指导建设和生产。在建设一号高炉时，筑炉专家弗列日科夫亲自钻进闷热的围管给工人作示范表演。当每项主体工程接近竣工和投入生产的时候，苏联专家们经常同我国工人一起苦干，甚至昼夜不离现场，指导新设备的试车和交工验收。
    苏联专家们从多方面帮助武钢建设者全面贯彻多、快、好、省的建设方针。根据专家组长巴杜洛夫的建议，武钢在还没有混铁炉的情况下，将三个平炉陆续建成投入生产，提前几个月为国家生产出了大量的钢。在炼钢厂的建设中，苏联设计监督专家马托尔斯基和土木建筑专家哈齐扬，考虑了技术上的许可性和经济上的合理性以后，结合我国具体情况，支持修改设计，节省了大批投资。
    苏联专家们对武钢每项工程的质量一丝不苟，负责到底。一号高炉基础浇灌时，专家组长萨维斯基，虽然患有严重关节炎，仍是一次又一次地爬到三十八度高温的基础坑里，检查混凝土的浇灌质量。
    炼钢厂的建设中，捷辽申专家一天数次在工地巡视，用铁片和火柴杆当工具，细致地检查砌砖质量，发现灰缝过宽不合设计要求，就和我国职工一起设法弥补。武钢已经建成的高炉、平炉、焦炉等主体工程的质量，都被评为优等。
