    Street Poetry and Painting Gallery
    Qin Li
    On the bustling Huaihai Middle Road in Shanghai, the newly updated street poetry and painting gallery has attracted many passers-by.
    The poetry and painting gallery was created by Shanghai writers and painters on "July 1st" last year. In this illustrated gallery, one can not only see the concise poetry and paintings of famous writers and painters, but also the works of many workers, peasants, and cadres. The poem "High Yields to Greet the Heroes' Conference" by Gu Henry, a worker at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, describes the enthusiastic scene of steelworkers in a production competition: "Furnace chases furnace, shift races shift, who can not rush to seize steel!" The painter Hua Sanchuan drew a poster for this poem depicting workers smelting steel in front of a furnace. Sun Ying's poem "The Commune is a Boat" from the Pioneer People's Commune in the suburbs of Shanghai, expresses the common confidence and love of hundreds of millions of peasants for the commune: "The commune is a boat, setting sail into the ocean; workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, all row the same oar; Chairman Mao steers the helm, sailing to paradise."
    The content of the published poetry and painting gallery closely revolves around major events and major festivals of various periods, reflecting the joyful and inspiring mood of the people of Shanghai. The street poetry and painting gallery in Shanghai has become a colorful, lively, and vibrant propaganda station and education base.

    街头诗画廊
    秦犁
    在上海市喧闹的淮海中路上，刚换新作的诗画廊吸引了许多过往行人。
    诗画廊是上海的作家和画家们在去年“七、一”创刊的。在这个图文并茂的诗画廊里，不仅可以见到著名作家、画家们的短小精悍的诗画，而且也能看到许多工人、农民和机关干部的作品。上钢一厂工人谷亨利的诗“高产迎接群英会”，写出了钢铁工人“炉追炉，班赶班，夺钢谁能不抢先！”的生产竞赛的热火朝天的情景。画家华三川为这首诗绘了一幅工人们炉前大炼钢铁的招贴画。上海郊区先锋人民公社孙颖的诗“公社一只船”，写出了亿万农民对公社的共同信心和热爱：“公社一只船，起锚入海洋；工农商学兵，同摇一根桨；毛主席掌舵，扬帆驶天堂。”
    已经出刊的诗画廊的内容，都紧密环绕着各个时期的重大事件和重大节日，反映了上海人民的欢欣鼓舞的心情。上海街头的诗画廊，已经成为一个丰富多彩、生动活泼的鼓动站和教育园地了。
