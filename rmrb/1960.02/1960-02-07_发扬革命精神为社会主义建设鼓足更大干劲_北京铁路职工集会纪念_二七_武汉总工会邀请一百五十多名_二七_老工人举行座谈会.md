Xinhua News Agency, February 6th. More than one thousand railway workers in Beijing held a rally tonight in the newly built "February 7th Theater" to commemorate the 37th anniversary of the "February 7th" Revolutionary Strike.

Li Jiebo, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, attended the commemoration meeting and delivered a speech. Those who attended the commemoration meeting included Liu Jianzhang, Vice Minister of Railways, Xiao Hongqi, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union, and more than fifty veteran workers from "February 7th" from places such as Changxindian, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and Tianjin.

Liu Jianzhang spoke first at the meeting. After describing the great achievements of China's socialist construction, he said: Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our railway workers must inherit the glorious tradition of the "February 7th" Revolution, promote the communist spirit, liberate our thinking, go all out, aim high, and build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. He asked railway workers across the country to vigorously engage in technical and cultural revolutions this year, and at the same time, study the works of Mao Zedong well, so as to improve railway construction.

Li Zhendong, a representative of the "February 7th" veteran workers and Director of the Traffic Safety Supervision Office of the Beijing Railway Bureau, and Hang Baohua, Vice Chairman of the Trade Union of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, also spoke at the meeting. In their speeches, they vividly introduced the facts of the heroic struggle of the Jinghan Railway workers thirty-seven years ago. They all stated that in commemorating the 37th anniversary of the "February 7th" Revolutionary Strike, railway workers across the country must always listen to the Party, carry forward the spirit of the "February 7th" Revolution, and create more outstanding achievements in this year's production.

After the memorial meeting, the China Railway Art Theater Drama Troupe performed the drama "February 7th Storm." The newly built "February 7th Theater," located outside Fuxingmen in Beijing, also held an opening ceremony today.

In recent days, some factories in Beijing have also launched various activities to commemorate the 37th anniversary of the "February 7th" Great Strike. The Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory held a commemoration meeting tonight with more than 2,000 people participating. Sun Maolin, a veteran worker who participated in the "February 7th" Great Strike, reported to the young workers about the struggle of "February 7th" at the meeting, encouraging them to study hard and strive to continue to achieve better and comprehensive leaps forward in 1960. Railway workers in the Beijing area invited Li Zhendong, director of the Traffic Safety Supervision Office of the Beijing Railway Bureau, who participated in the "February 7th" Great Strike, to give a report. More than 1,000 employees of the Beijing Tram Company listened to the report of Zuo Shijun, a veteran worker of "February 7th". To commemorate "February 7th", the Beijing Library and the Capital Library will jointly hold a meeting tomorrow for "February 7th" veteran worker Hang Baohua to meet with readers.

Furthermore, Zhang Shun, an old hero who actively participated in the "February 7th" Great Strike thirty-seven years ago and a veteran worker at the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, is now serving as a technical consultant at the agricultural implement repair factory of the Changxindian Sino-Czech Friendship People's Commune in Fengtai District, Beijing. Since he retired and returned to his hometown in 1954, he has helped farmers set up a repair factory, manufactured and repaired 10,000 small farm tools, and reformed seven new types of tools.

This seventy-year-old hero worked in the factory for forty-three years and is an excellent blacksmith. He retired and returned to his hometown in 1954 to enjoy his old age. After returning to his hometown, he often thought about how to continue to contribute to the cause of socialist construction. In the spring of 1956, he saw community members digging frozen soil and the tips of their hoes were worn out. He asked the community members why they didn't repair them. The community members told him that it would take several miles to repair a hoe and no one in the village knew how to repair them. These words moved Zhang Shun's heart. After asking the township Party committee for instructions, he picked up the hammer again and, with three community members, set up an agricultural tool repair factory in a dilapidated temple. Since then, nearby production teams have sent their farm tools to this skilled old blacksmith for repair. In the three years after the factory was established, it manufactured and repaired three to four thousand small farm tools every year.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 6th. The Wuhan Federation of Trade Unions and the Wuhan Railway Bureau invited more than 150 "February 7th" veteran workers in Wuhan to a symposium on the afternoon of the 5th to commemorate the 37th anniversary of the "February 7th" revolutionary struggle.

Chen Yuxi, Vice Chairman of the Wuhan Federation of Trade Unions, spoke at the meeting, extending cordial greetings to the "February 7th" veteran workers. Lin Maoxiang, a "February 7th" veteran worker and Vice Chairman of the Wuhan Regional Branch of the China Railway Trade Union, representing the "February 7th" veteran workers in Wuhan, said in his speech that he was determined to continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the "February 7th" struggle, always listen to the Party, study hard, cultivate and educate the younger generation, and contribute to socialist construction.

On the eve of "February 7th," the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee, and the Wuhan Federation of Trade Unions, the Communist Youth League Committee, the Women's Federation, and the responsible persons of the Wuhan Railway Bureau and more than 20 "February 7th" veteran workers formed a condolence group, carrying letters of condolence, condolence money, and condolence items, and conducted cordial condolences to the families of the "February 7th" revolutionary martyrs in the Wuhan area. The deep concern of the Party and the government deeply moved the families of the "February 7th" revolutionary martyrs. They unanimously stated that they were determined to inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of the revolutionary martyrs and contribute to this year's continued leap forward with greater vigor. Liu Shuangquan, a family member of a martyr who is now working at the Jiang'an Locomotive Depot, said: "The Party and Chairman Mao are so concerned about us. In the future, I will continue to go all out, overcome all difficulties, and complete the tasks assigned to me by the Party with every minute and every second." The condolence group also sent letters of condolence and condolence money to the families of "February 7th" martyrs Lin Xiangqian, Shi Yang, Chen Duanbing, Cao Yuliang, and Wu Caizhen, who lived far away.

    发扬革命精神为社会主义建设鼓足更大干劲
    北京铁路职工集会纪念“二七”
    武汉总工会邀请一百五十多名“二七”老工人举行座谈会
    新华社6日讯　北京一千多名铁路职工今天晚间在新落成的“二七剧场”举行集会，纪念“二七”革命大罢工三十七周年。
    中华全国总工会副主席李颉伯出席纪念会并且在会上讲了话。出席纪念会的，有铁道部副部长刘建章，中国铁路工会全国委员会副主席萧洪启，还有五十多位来自长辛店、保定、石家庄、天津等地的“二七”老工人。
    刘建章在会上首先讲话，他叙述了我国社会主义建设的伟大成就后说：我们铁路职工一定要在党和毛主席的英明领导下，继承“二七”革命的光荣传统，发扬共产主义风格，解放思想，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义。他要求全国铁路职工今年要大搞技术革命和文化革命，同时要很好地学习毛泽东著作，把铁路建设工作搞得更好。
    “二七”老工人代表、北京铁路局行车安全监察室主任李震纲、长辛店机车车辆工厂工会副主席杭宝华也先后在会上讲话。他们在讲话中生动地介绍了京汉铁路工人在三十七年前进行英勇斗争的事实。他们都表示，在纪念“二七”革命大罢工三十七周年的时候，全国铁路职工要永远听党的话，要发扬“二七”革命的精神，要在今年的生产上创造出更出色的成绩。
    纪念会后，中国铁道艺术剧院话剧团演出了话剧“二七风暴”。新近落成的“二七剧场”座落在北京复兴门外，今天同时举行了开幕典礼。
    连日来，北京市一些工厂也展开各种活动，纪念“二七”大罢工三十七周年。长辛店机车车辆工厂今晚举行了两千多人参加的纪念大会，参加过“二七”大罢工的老工人孙茂林在会上向青年工人报告了“二七”的斗争事迹，勉励他们努力学习，争取1960年继续实现更好的全面的跃进。北京地区的铁路工人，邀请参加过“二七”大罢工的北京铁路局行车安全监察室主任李震纲做了报告。北京市电车公司一千多职工听了“二七”老工人左士俊的报告。北京图书馆同首都图书馆为纪念“二七”，明天将联合举办“二七”老工人杭宝华同读者见面会。
    又讯　曾在三十七年前积极参加过“二七”大罢工的老英雄——长辛店机车车辆工厂老工人张顺，现在担任北京市丰台区长辛店中捷友好人民公社农具修配厂的技术顾问。他从1954年退休回乡起，帮助农民办起一座修理厂，制造和修理了一万件小农具，改革了七种新式工具。
    这位七十岁的老英雄在工厂劳动了四十三年，是一名出色的锻工。1954年退休回乡养老。还乡后，他常想如何继续为社会主义建设事业出点力。1956年春天，有一次他看到社员刨冻土，镐尖磨得秃秃的，他问社员为什么不去修理，社员告诉他，修一次镐头得跑几里路，村里没人会修。这句话说动了张顺的心，在请示乡党委以后，他又重新拿起铁锤，带着三名社员，在一所破庙里办起了农具修理厂。从此，附近的生产队都把农具送来请这位手艺高超的老锻工修理。工厂成立后的三年中，每年都要制造和修理小农具三、四千件。
    新华社武汉6日电　武汉市总工会和武汉铁路局5日下午邀请在武汉的一百五十多位“二七”老工人举行座谈会，纪念“二七”革命斗争三十七周年。
