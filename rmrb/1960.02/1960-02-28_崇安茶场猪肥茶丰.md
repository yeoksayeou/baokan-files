    Chong'an Tea Farm Achieves Bumper Harvests of Pigs and Tea
    (Our report) The Chong'an Tea Farm in Chong'an County, Fujian Province, has achieved a double harvest of tea and livestock by raising pigs.
    When the Chong'an Tea Farm was established in 1954, it had only 300 mu of barren tea gardens. In 1955, the average yield per mu was only 13 jin. Although the farm expanded the tea garden area and strengthened tea garden management, the tea yield did not increase rapidly due to the reliance on chemical fertilizers and the superstition of the local masses, who said that "tea trees eat vegetarian food and not meat, and cannot be fertilized with human and animal manure and other organic fertilizers." Through soil testing, the farm found that the soil where only inorganic fertilizers were applied became hardened, which affected the growth of tea trees. Later, pig manure was used as fertilizer in a small hill tea garden for experimentation, and higher yields were achieved than in comparable tea gardens. This reversed the erroneous view of relying solely on chemical fertilizers and that organic fertilizers could not be applied in tea gardens, and began to raise pigs to accumulate fertilizer. The number of pigs increased year by year, reaching 1,720 in 1958, with an average of one pig for every 1.4 mu of tea garden. As pig farming developed year by year and pig manure fertilizer increased year by year, tea yields also increased year by year. Last year, a total of more than 300,000 dan of pig manure, urine, and stable manure were accumulated, with an average of more than 100 dan of fertilizer applied per mu of tea garden, and the yield of tea per mu increased to 90 jin. Pig raising promoted the increase in tea production, and the abundant tea production provided a strong financial foundation for pig raising, promoting the rapid development of pig production. Pig farming in the tea farm not only promoted the double harvest of tea and livestock, but also solved the problem that planting tea trees could not generate income in the same year, achieving the goal of supporting long-term development with short-term gains. It also supplied meat to the market. To date, this tea farm has sold 610 large fat pigs to the state.
    The Chong'an Tea Farm mainly manages perennial tea trees, but the attached pig farm and the development of pig production have many favorable conditions. First of all, the tea farm has a relatively abundant supply of feed for raising pigs. In addition to fully utilizing the intercropping of feed crops in the tea garden without affecting the growth of tea, it can also plant one or two seasons of crops such as corn, sweet potatoes, and wild beans in the newly cultivated tea garden land every year as feed. After the wasteland has been planted with one or two crops of miscellaneous grains, it can also level the land and improve the soil, promoting the growth of tea trees in the future. Secondly, pig farming in the tea farm also has many advantages in terms of labor. In addition to the 12 workers who are dedicated to raising pigs, the Chong'an Tea Farm employs tea-planting workers to take care of tasks such as planting feed and transporting fertilizer, combining pig raising and tea planting, saving a lot of labor.

    崇安茶场猪肥茶丰
    本报讯　福建崇安县崇安茶场养猪获得茶、畜双丰收。
    崇安茶场于1954年建场时，全场只有三百亩贫瘠的茶园，1955年平均亩产只有十三斤。该场虽然一面扩大茶园面积，一面加强茶园管理，但由于存在着依靠化学肥料的思想，和迷信当地群众流传的“茶树吃素不吃荤，不能施人畜粪等有机肥”的说法，茶叶产量一直提高不快。场里通过土质化验，发现单施无机肥料的土壤，土质结板，影响茶树生长的情况。后来就在小丘茶园里施猪粪肥作试验，取得了比同等茶园产量高的成绩。这就扭转了单纯依靠化学肥料和茶园不能施有机肥的错误观点，开始养猪积肥，猪只的头数逐年增长，1958年达到一千七百二十头，平均一亩四分茶园就有一头猪。养猪业一年比一年发展，猪粪肥一年比一年增加，茶叶产量也一年比一年提高。去年共积猪粪尿、厩肥等三十多万担，平均每亩茶园施肥一百多担，亩产茶叶提高到九十斤。养猪促使茶叶增产，而茶叶丰产后，又为养猪业提供了雄厚的资金，促进养猪生产的迅速发展。茶场养猪不仅促进了茶、畜双丰收，而且也解决了种植茶树不能当年收益的问题，达到以短养长的目的。并为市场供应了肉食，到目前止，这个茶场已经卖给国家六百一十头大肥猪。
    崇安茶场是以经营多年生的茶树为主的，但附设养猪场，发展养猪生产，却有很多有利条件。首先，茶场养猪有着比较充裕的饲料，除了在不影响茶叶生长的条件下，充分利用茶园间种饲料外，还可以在每年新开垦的茶园地里种一季到两季的玉米、甘薯、山豆等作物，作为饲料。生荒地种过一两熟杂粮以后，还可以起平整土地，改良土壤的作用，促进以后茶树的生长。其次，茶场养猪在劳力上也有许多方便的地方，崇安茶场除了固定十二名工人专责养猪外，其余种饲料、运肥料等工作都由种茶工人来负担，把养猪和种茶结合起来，节省了许多劳力。
