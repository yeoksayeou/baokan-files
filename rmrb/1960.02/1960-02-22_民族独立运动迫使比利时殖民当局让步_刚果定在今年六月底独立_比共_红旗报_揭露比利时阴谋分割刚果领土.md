Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, February 20th: The roundtable conference held in Brussels from January 20th between the Belgian government and representatives of the main Congolese political parties officially concluded today. In the face of the unstoppable momentum of the Congolese people's struggle for national independence, the Belgian government was forced at the conference to agree that Congo would achieve independence on June 30th this year, and that provincial and national parliamentary elections would be held in May and June, with the Congolese government to be established on June 20th.

It was announced that the roundtable conference also reached the following agreements: The Belgian government agreed to establish a group of six Congolese people during the "transition period" from February 20th to Congo's independence on June 30th to jointly manage all administrative affairs of Congo with the Belgian Governor-General in Congo. A Congolese group of three people will also be established in each province. In Brussels, a six-member Congolese committee will be established to work with the Belgian Minister of Congolese Affairs to draft a treaty on the future relationship between Belgium and Congo, and to draft Congo's constitution and various laws.

Conference participants also agreed that the joint session of the newly established Congolese Senate and House of Representatives would appoint the Congolese head of state from the time Congo declares independence until the constitution comes into effect. The King of Belgium will continue to serve as the head of Congo until June 30th.

The roundtable conference also decided that only Congolese people who are 21 years of age or older could participate in the upcoming general election, and women and Europeans will not participate in this vote.

It is reported that in order to maintain its control over Congo, the Belgian government is prepared to stipulate in the drafting of the Congolese constitution that Belgian goods, people, and capital can have "free passage" in Congo. The conference also decided that Belgian officials currently in Congo will continue to work there after Congo's independence. In addition, Belgian colonialists can also maintain their colonial interests in Congo through treaties signed with Congo, and laws "helped" to be drafted for Congo.

The Belgian government's forced agreement to Congo's independence is the result of the Congolese people's unyielding struggle. As everyone knows, just fifteen months ago, this country was still seen as a "stable oasis" in the eyes of Western colonialists. The large-scale riots launched by the Congolese people in Leopoldville on January 4th last year opened a new chapter in Congolese history. Since then, although the Belgian government has adopted repressive measures such as arrests, massacres, and torture, as well as political deception, in an attempt to restore the "order" of colonial rule, demonstrations, strikes, and tax resistance activities have continued to occur in Congo. The Congolese people also resolutely opposed the deceptive plan of "phased independence" proposed by the Belgian government in order to continue maintaining colonial rule, and effectively resisted the so-called elections that the colonialists originally planned to hold in December last year. These facts clearly show that no conspiracy of the colonialists can ultimately prevent the African people who are determined to fight from moving towards independence.

Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: Brussels dispatch: The Belgian Communist Party's newspaper "Red Flag" published an article on February 12th, exposing the Belgian monopoly consortium's conspiracy to divide Congolese territory in order to maintain its privileged right to plunder Congolese resources.

The article pointed out that just as the roundtable conference discussing the future of Congo was debating whether the underground resources of Congo should belong to the Congolese central government or the provincial governments, certain Congolese parties established by white people, representing the Belgian large monopoly mining companies, did not conceal their separatist tendencies and demanded that this right be handed over to the provinces.

The article quoted Kasongo, leader of the Congolese United Party, as saying, "The colonialists are trying by all means to separate Katanga Province from Congo, because Katanga Province is the richest province in Congo."

The article also quoted Lumumba, chairman of the Congolese National Movement, condemning the colonialists for carrying out divisive activities, saying, "We are fighting for independence not to fall under the control of foreign consortia." Congo's Katanga Province is rich in resources. The Katanga Union Mining Company, composed of Belgian, British, and American capital, which monopolizes Congo's economic lifeline, has obtained control of one-third of the land in this province, with a mining period of ninety-nine years. According to the profits obtained by this company in the six years from 1950 to 1955, its profit rate reached one hundred percent.

    民族独立运动迫使比利时殖民当局让步
    刚果定在今年六月底独立
    比共“红旗报”揭露比利时阴谋分割刚果领土
    据新华社布鲁塞尔20日电　比利时政府和刚果各主要政党代表从1月20日起在布鲁塞尔举行的圆桌会议，今天正式闭幕。在刚果人民争取民族独立运动势不可当的情况下，比利时政府在会上被迫同意刚果在今年6月30日实现独立，并在5月和6月举行省议会和全国议会的选举，6月20日成立刚果政府。
    据宣布，这个圆桌会议还达成了下述协议：比利时政府同意在2月20日到6月30日刚果独立的“过渡期间”建立一个由六名刚果人组成的小组，同比利时驻刚果总督共同管理刚果的一切行政事务，在各省也将成立一个刚果三人小组。在布鲁塞尔，将成立一个刚果六人委员会，同比利时刚果事务大臣起草关于比利时和刚果未来关系的条约、草拟刚果的宪法和各种法律。
    会议参加者还同意，由将来新成立的刚果参、众两院联席会议任命自刚果宣布独立到宪法生效期间的刚果国家元首。在6月30日前，比利时国王继续充当刚果元首。
    圆桌会议还决定，只有年满二十一岁的刚果人才能参加即将到来的大选，妇女和欧洲人不参加这一次投票。
    据报道，比利时政府为了保持它对刚果的控制，准备在草拟刚果宪法的时候规定比利时的货物、人和资本可以在刚果“自由通行”。这次会上也决定，目前在刚果的比利时官员在刚果独立后将继续留在那里工作。此外，比利时殖民主义者还可以通过同刚果签订的条约、“帮助”刚果拟定的法律等来保持他们在刚果的殖民利益。
    比利时政府被迫同意刚果实行独立，是刚果人民进行不屈不挠的斗争的结果。大家知道，仅仅在十五个月以前，这个国家在西方殖民者的眼中还是“安定的绿洲”。去年1月4日刚果人民在利奥波德维尔发动的大规模暴动，掀开了刚果历史的新的一页。从那个时候以来，虽然比利时政府采用了逮捕、屠杀、酷刑等镇压措施和政治欺骗手段，企图恢复殖民主义统治的“秩序”，但是游行、罢工、抗税活动在刚果还是连续不断地发生。刚果人民还坚决地反对比利时政府为了继续维持殖民统治而提出的“分阶段独立”的欺骗性计划，并且有效地抵制了殖民者原来准备在去年12月搞的所谓选举。这些事实清楚地表明，殖民者的任何阴谋都终究无法阻挡坚决进行斗争的非洲人民走向独立。
    新华社20日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：比利时共产党机关报“红旗报”2月12日发表一篇文章，揭露比利时垄断财团为了保持掠夺刚果资源的特权，阴谋分割刚果领土。
    文章指出，正当讨论刚果前途问题的圆桌会议就有关刚果地下资源应该属于刚果中央政权还是各省政权的问题展开讨论时，代表比利时大垄断矿业公司的、由白种人所建立的某些刚果政党并不掩饰他们的分裂主义倾向，要求把这种权利交给各省。
    文章援引刚果联合党领袖卡松戈的讲话说，“殖民者正企图通过一切手法使加丹加省脱离刚果，因为加丹加省是刚果最富裕的省份。”
    文章还引用了刚果民族运动党主席卢蒙巴谴责殖民主义者进行分裂活动的讲话，卢蒙巴说，“我们争取独立不是为了落在外国财团的控制之下。”刚果加丹加省的资源很丰富。垄断着刚果经济命脉的由比、英、美三国资本组成的加丹加联合矿业公司在这个省获得了三分之一的土地支配权，开采期限为九十九年。据1950年到1955年的六年中这个公司获得的利润计算，它的利润率达百分之百。
