Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 14th: Five Japanese organizations, including the Japan-China Friendship Association and the Japanese Red Cross Society, held a representative meeting on the 12th, demanding that the Nobusuke Kishi government acknowledge the list of Chinese people who were taken to Japan by Japanese militarists during the Japanese invasion of China and who were tortured to death in Japan.

The list of 6,732 Chinese people who were forcibly taken to Japan during the war and died there, compiled by seventeen Japanese non-governmental organizations, including the Executive Committee for慰安 (comfort) of Chinese Martyrs, was published on the 12th. The list includes not only the names and ages of the deceased and their addresses in China, but also the locations where they were forced to work in Japan, as well as conversations with people who knew the deceased during their lifetimes.

The Japan-China Friendship Association and other five organizations also demanded that the Nobusuke Kishi government, while acknowledging this list, compile a complete list based on it and hand it over to the Chinese government.

Participants in the meeting on the 12th included Jiichirō Matsumoto, Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Kenjuro Yanagida, representative of the Japan Peace Committee, Kazushi Kasai, Vice Chairman of the Japanese Red Cross Society, and Keijun Otani, Chairman of the Executive Committee for the慰安 (comfort) of Chinese Martyrs.

Otani emphasized at the meeting that Japan should atone for the crimes it committed against China in the past. He said that the list, compiled through the joint efforts of seventeen organizations, embodies the shared sense of guilt of the Japanese people.

In order to investigate the situation of Chinese who died in Japan during the war, Japanese non-governmental organizations conducted seven years of work starting in 1953, studying government documents and collecting materials from the factories and workplaces where the martyred workers worked, as well as records of conversations with people who knew the deceased during their lifetimes.

According to the appendix to this list, the Japanese Tojo Cabinet made a decision on November 27, 1942, in violation of international law and humanitarianism, to forcibly send Chinese to Japan. The document states that these Chinese were forced to engage in slave-like labor in Japan, and nearly 7,000 of them died or were killed as a result of mistreatment.

The appendix also reveals that, according to data from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the number of Chinese people forcibly sent to Japan from China from July 1943 to May 1945 was 38,935. However, the appendix concludes, based on other materials, that the actual number of Chinese forced to work in Japan far exceeded the figures admitted by the Japanese government.

The appendix states that the then Minister of Commerce and Industry of the Japanese Tojo Cabinet, and the current Prime Minister, Nobusuke Kishi, should be held responsible for this evil decision. The appendix also strongly condemns Nobusuke Kishi for refusing and ignoring the demands of the Chinese people and government to inform the Chinese government of the list of Chinese martyrs and the circumstances of their deaths.

It is reported that detailed reports on the circumstances of the deaths of Chinese martyrs, and all the relevant documents, such as the complete list of Chinese who were forcibly transported from China to Japan, will be published successively.

    日本民间团体发表战时在日本被虐杀的中国人名单
    要求岸政府就中国烈士殉难情况作出交代
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会和日本红十字会等五个团体12日召开代表会议，要求岸信介政府承认在日本侵略中国战争期间被日本军国主义者掠往日本、并且被虐杀死在日本的中国人的名单。
    由包括中国殉难烈士慰灵实行委员会等十七个日本非官方团体调查和制定的在战时被强迫掠到日本并死在那里的六千七百三十二名中国人的名单，已经在12日发表。名单中不但包括死者姓名、年龄，在中国的住址和他们被迫在日本工作的地点，而且还有同死者生前认识的人的谈话。
    日中友好协会等五个团体还要求岸信介政府在承认这份名单的同时，再根据这份名单编制完整的名单交给中国政府。
    参加12日的会议的有日中友好协会主席松本治一郎、日本和平委员会代表柳田谦十郎、日本红十字会副会长葛西嘉资、中国殉难烈士慰灵实行委员会委员长大谷莹润等人。
    大谷莹润在会上强调说，日本应当为过去对中国所犯的罪行陪罪。他说，经过十七个团体共同努力编制的这个名单是日本人所共有的负咎心情的体现。
    日本民间团体为了调查战时在日本殉难的中国人的情况，从1953年开始进行了七年工作，研究了政府文件、从殉难烈士工作的工厂和工作地点以及同死者生前认识的人的谈话纪录中搜集材料。
    据这份名单的附件揭露，日本东条内阁于1942年11月27日违反国际公法和人道主义作出了把中国人强迫送往日本的决定。文件说，这些中国人被迫在日本从事奴隶式的劳动，他们当中将近七千人因受虐待而死或被杀害。
    附件还揭露，根据日本外务省的资料，从1943年7月到1945年5月，从中国强迫送往日本的中国人的人数，为三万八千九百三十五名。但是，附件根据另外的材料得出结论说，被强迫在日本工作的中国人的实际人数远远超过日本官方所承认的数字。
    附件说，当时日本东条内阁的工商产业相、现首相岸信介应对这一罪恶的决定负责。附件还强烈指责岸信介拒绝和无视中国人民和政府提出的把中国殉难烈士的名单以及他们死难的情况告知中国政府的要求。
    据报道，关于中国殉难烈士死难情况的详细报告和关于被强迫从中国运往日本的中国人的全部名单等有关三个文件，还要陆续发表。
