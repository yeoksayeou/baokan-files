    At the Birthplace of the High-Yielding Square
    By Our Correspondent Wang Bingkui
    Forty miles east of the ancient city of Handan, along a tree-lined highway, lies the birthplace of the high-yielding square – Chengan Commune in Cixian County, Hebei Province, famous for its cotton production.

    Stepping into the high-yielding square, spirits soar;
    Full of energy, songs echo across the fields.

    This is the heartfelt experience of the commune members, and a hymn to the high-yielding square. Although it is not yet the harvest season of rippling silver waves, the vast fields still present a charming picture. In the ten-thousand-mu cotton high-yielding square of the Daodongbao Production Team, canals crisscross the boundless land, and wells stand in rows; wide, flat, and straight machine-cultivated roads run in all directions. The glass windows of the seedling greenhouses gleam, and the first batch of seedlings grown in the greenhouses has already sprouted lush green shoots. In the newly built pigsties, piglets bask comfortably in the sun. Male and female professional team members are busy tilling the land, delivering manure, feeding pigs... After their intensive labor, according to the schedule, they engage in various activities, some reading newspapers, some learning to read, some discussing techniques, some practicing shooting, some singing, some dancing, and some quietly listening to news and cultural programs broadcast on the wired radio. "Newborn Child"

    The high-yielding square – this new form of agricultural production – appeared in Chengan in the spring of 1958. As early as 1956, three types of experimental fields emerged here: cadre experimental fields, labor model experimental fields, and mass experimental fields. These experimental fields served as models for large-field agricultural production and provided experience. The two-mu experimental field planted by cotton girl Wang Sumei yielded 500 jin of seed cotton per mu, four times higher than the average yield of cotton fields in the agricultural cooperative at the time.

    In 1957, her four-mu cotton experimental field produced 700 jin of seed cotton per mu. The fact that Wang Sumei's experimental field achieved high yields caused a great stir in Chengan. The former Chengan County Party Committee put forward the slogan "Learn from Sumei, catch up with Sumei, surpass Sumei." After consolidation and improvement, the advanced agricultural production cooperatives at the time continued to develop their productive forces, and a new situation of great leap forward in production emerged in the winter of 1957. The broad masses of peasants put forward the goal of "3,000-10,000" (1,000 jin of cotton per mu, 1,000 jin of grain per mu, 1,000 jin of oil crops per mu, and 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu) to increase production at high speed. What measures should be taken to achieve this goal? The former Chengan County Party Committee decided to take high yields as a model and large-scale high-yielding fields as the backbone to achieve overall production increase. Guo Yunzao, secretary of the Daodongbao Township Party Committee, said to the old farmer Qiao Pantong: "Sumei engages in experimental fields, we engage in large-scale high-yielding fields." They also gave the large-scale high-yielding fields an academic name – high-yielding square. In May 1958, six advanced cooperatives, including Daodongbao, Southwest Village, and Qucun, jointly established a three-thousand-mu cotton high-yielding square, which was the "newborn child" of the high-yielding square.

    As soon as the high-yielding square appeared, it displayed a brand-new production picture, showing its tremendous power in production. However, at that time, the scope of the advanced cooperatives was small, which restricted the high-yielding square. The current Chengan People's Commune was then forty-six advanced cooperatives, with an average of only three thousand mu of cultivated land per advanced cooperative. The Chengguan Dazhongjie Advanced Cooperative only had one thousand four hundred mu of land like "stars all over the sky," divided into more than one hundred and forty large and small pieces, and more than three hundred mu of land was more than ten li away. How could they engage in large-scale high-yielding squares? Although several advanced cooperatives such as Daodongbao jointly established a three-thousand-mu cotton high-yielding square, because it was not a single economic accounting unit and the leadership was not unified, there were many difficulties.

    In the second half of 1958, the people's commune emerged as the times required, opening up broad prospects for large-scale high-yielding squares. Within three months after the communization, the Chengan Commune dug 154 canals, drilled 76 machine wells, and more than 1,000 brick wells, expanding the irrigated area by 80,000 mu, and the irrigated area surged from 25% to more than 80%, basically realizing water conservancy. Under the unified leadership of the commune, more than 13,000 mu of remote land and "interspersed land" were also adjusted between the production teams. The land of the production teams was connected into large areas, initially realizing regionalization of planting, paving the way for square production.

              New Stage

    The establishment of the people's commune brought the high-yielding square to a new and higher stage of development. In 1959, the Chengan People's Commune established one cotton high-yielding square of more than 10,000 mu, one square of 6,000 mu, and nine squares of more than 1,000 mu. The commune had a total of 45,000 mu of cotton high-yielding squares, accounting for 45% of the total cotton field area. The three-thousand-mu cotton high-yielding square jointly established by several advanced cooperatives such as Daodongbao was still the "newborn child" of the high-yielding square movement in 1958, and became the "oldest brother" of the high-yielding square in 1959. This cotton high-yielding square developed to 13,800 mu. 1,250 laborers were fixed in the square, forming 53 professional teams, and a Red and Expert School was established.

    The members of the Chengan People's Commune sing:

    High-yielding extends beyond the sky, cotton-picking girls hide in the clouds;
    Thousands of acres of cotton fields are like a blue sea, rolling silver waves flood Chengan.

    They said: "In the past, increasing production relied on planting more land, but now increasing production relies more on squares"; "High-yielding square can guarantee the realization of increased production and is also a base for commodity production." This is absolutely true. In 1959, the average yield of lint cotton per mu in the commune's high-yielding squares was 180 jin, an increase of 50% compared with the cotton outside the square. The "10,000-mu cotton high-yielding square" of the Daodongbao Production Team created a high record of an average yield of 212 jin of lint cotton per mu, an increase of nearly 100% compared with the cotton outside the square. Driven by the high-yielding square, the per-mu yield of the commune's 100,000 mu of cotton reached the target stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program eight years ahead of schedule, exceeding it by 50%. The ten mu of thin and small third-class cotton seedlings outside the high-yielding square in Daodongbao Village were assigned to the square. The "Jiufeng" (nine cotton girls with "Feng" in their names) professional team was determined to turn it into a high-yielding field. At that time, some people said to "Jiufeng": "Can you still manage such cotton seedlings to make a name for yourselves?" These sarcastic remarks did not shake the girls' determination to turn third-class seedlings into high-yielding fields. Under the leadership of the Party branch, their determination became even stronger. They adopted advanced management techniques, achieving "people not leaving the land, hands not leaving the cotton," and meticulously managed it. By the time of budding, the cotton seedlings became dark, large, fat, and strong. At this time, those who had said "cannot make a name for themselves" said, "The plants are tall, the bolls are big, the cotton has really improved."

    The large-scale high yields of the high-yielding square have made the past low-yield poor teams rich and quickly caught up with the rich teams. The North Street Production Team in the United Cotton High-Yielding Square of the Chengguan Management District only produced 40-50 jin of lint cotton per mu in 1957, when it did not engage in high-yielding squares, with an average income of 65 yuan per person. In 1959, it engaged in a 200-mu cotton high-yielding square. Under the unified leadership and support of the commune, the teams in the square jointly built farmland capital construction, purchased production materials, and the teams cooperated, supported each other, and spread production experience and technology to each other. The 200-mu high-yielding square achieved a bumper harvest, producing 12,800 jin more lint cotton compared to the cotton outside the high-yielding square.

        Red and Expert Great Classroom

    The high-yielding square is an organizational form of large-scale production, which requires a team that is both red and expert, organized, conscious, disciplined, and combat-effective to manage it. When starting the high-yielding square, most people did not understand new technologies. Although the old farmers had some experience, it was far from enough to manage the production of the high-yielding square. What to do? The commune members unanimously requested to study. The Red and Expert School was first established in the 10,000-mu cotton high-yielding square in Daodongbao, and technical groups were established in each team, with technicians in each group, so that technology entered the high-yielding square. The first difficulty encountered in learning technology was the low level of education. Some commune members said: "I can't recognize even two pockets of big characters, how can I learn technology!" The commune members' eagerness to improve their cultural level made cultural learning enter the high-yielding square; loving to dance and sing is the characteristic of young men and women, and cultural entertainment also entered the square.

    Old farmer Lin Changrun said: "One year in the square is better than ten years of study." In fact, it's more than just better than ten years of study! In 1959, in the 10,000-mu cotton high-yielding square in Daodongbao alone, 275 commune members reached the level of ordinary technicians; thousands of cotton girls in their teens throughout the commune spoke eloquently and logically about cotton management techniques. Collective labor life has cultivated the commune members' collectivist thought and communist style, and they help each other and unite closely.

    在丰产方诞生地
    本报记者　王炳奎
    从古城邯郸，顺着林荫公路，东行四十里，就是丰产方的诞生地——盛产棉花的河北磁县成安公社。
    走进丰产方，分外精神爽；
    浑身全是劲，遍野歌声扬。
    这是社员们的切身体会，也是对丰产方的赞歌。目前，虽然不是碧波银浪的丰收季节，千顷方田，仍然是一幅媚人的图画。道东堡生产队的万亩棉花丰产方，一望无际的大地上，渠道如网，机井成行；一条条宽坦平直的机耕道，纵横交错。育苗温室的玻璃窗，闪闪发光，第一批温室育苗已长出了翠绿的嫩芽。一排排新建的猪舍里，猪仔在舒适地晒着太阳。男女专业队员们，在整地、送粪、喂猪……。紧张劳动之余，按照作息时间表，他们进行着各项活动，有的读报，有的认字，有的讲技术，有的练习射击，有的唱歌，有的在跳舞，有的在静听着有线广播播送的新闻和文艺节目。“初生子”
    丰产方——这个农业生产的新形式，1958年春季在成安出现了。1956年，这里就出现了三种试验田：干部试验田、劳动模范试验田和群众试验田。这些试验田，为大田农业生产作出了样板，提供经验。棉花姑娘王素梅种的二亩试验田，亩产籽棉五百斤，比当时农业社棉田的平均亩产高四倍。
    1957年，她的四亩棉花试验田，每亩产了七百斤籽棉。王素梅试验田高额丰产的事实，在成安引起很大震动。原成安县委提出了“学素梅、赶素梅、超素梅”的口号。当时的高级农业生产合作社经过巩固提高，生产力不断发展，1957年冬季出现了生产大跃进的新形势。广大农民提出了“三千一万”（棉花亩产一千斤、粮食亩产一千斤、油料亩产一千斤，甘薯亩产一万斤）高速度增产的目标。采取什么措施实现这个目标呢？原成安县委确定以高额丰产为样板，大面积丰产为骨干，实现全面增产。道东堡乡党委书记郭云藻对老农乔潘同说：“素梅搞试验田，咱搞大面积丰产田。”他们还给大面积丰产田起了个学名——丰产方。1958年5月，道东堡、西南庄、曲村等六个高级社，联合搞了三千亩棉花丰产方，这就是丰产方的“初生子”。
    丰产方一出现，就展示出一幅崭新的生产图景，显示了它在生产上的巨大威力。但是，当时高级社范围小，还束缚着丰产方的手脚。现在的成安人民公社，那时是四十六个高级社，平均每个高级社只有三千亩耕地。城关大中街高级社只有“满天星”的一千四百多亩地，分成大小一百四十多块，还有三百多亩地远隔十华里以外。这又怎能搞大面积丰产方呢？道东堡等几个高级社虽然联合搞起了三千亩棉花丰产方，也因为不是一个经济核算单位，领导不统一，存在着不少困难。
    1958年下半年，人民公社应运而生，给大搞丰产方开拓了广阔天地。公社化以后三个月，成安公社就挖渠一百五十四条，打机井七十六眼，砖井千余眼，扩大浇地面积八万亩，灌溉面积由25％激增到80％以上，基本上实现了水利化。在公社统一领导下，各生产队之间还调整了一万三千多亩边远地和“插花地”。各生产队的土地联成了大片，初步实现了种植区域化，为划方生产铺平了道路。
              新阶段
    人民公社的建立，使丰产方发展到更高的新阶段。1959年成安人民公社搞了一个万亩以上棉花丰产方、一个六千亩方、九个千亩以上的方，全社棉花丰产方共有四万五千亩，占棉田总面积的45％。道东堡等几个高级社联合搞的三千亩棉花丰产方，1958年还是丰产方运动的“初生子”，1959年成了丰产方的“老大哥”。这个棉花丰产方发展到一万三千八百亩。方内固定了一千二百五十名劳动力，组成了五十三个专业队，并设立了红专学校。
    成安人民公社的社员们歌唱着：
    丰产万里天外天，采棉姑娘藏云间；
    千顷棉田如碧海，滚滚银波漫成安。
    他们说：“以往增产靠多种地，现在增产多搞方”；“丰产方，能保证实现增产，又是商品生产的基地”。这话是千真万确的。1959年，全社丰产方平均亩产皮棉一百八十斤，比方外的棉花增产50％。道东堡生产队的“万亩棉花丰产方”创造了平均亩产皮棉二百一十二斤的高纪录，比方外的棉花增产将近一倍。在丰产方的带动下，全社十万亩棉花的亩产量，提前八年超额50％达到了全国农业发展纲要规定的指标。道东堡村丰产方外的十亩又瘦又小的三类棉苗，划归方里后，“九凤”（九个名带凤字的棉花姑娘）专业队决心把它变成丰产田。当时有的人对“九凤”说：“这样的棉苗你们还能管出个名堂来？”这些风凉话没有动摇姑娘们变三类苗为丰产田的决心。在党支部的领导下，她们的决心更坚强了。她们采用先进的管理技术，做到“人不离地，手不离棉”，精心细管，到现蕾的时候，棉苗变得又黑又大、又肥又壮了。这时候，说过“搞不出名堂来”的人，说是“棵又高，桃又大，这棉花可变好了”。
    丰产方大面积高额丰产，使过去的低产穷队富裕起来，迅速赶上了富队。城关管理区联合棉花丰产方里的北街生产队，1957年没有搞丰产方的时候，亩产皮棉仅四五十斤，平均每人收入六十五元。1959年搞了二百亩棉花丰产方，在公社统一领导和支持下，方内各队共同兴修农田基本建设，购买生产资料，队与队互相协作，互相支援，互相传播生产经验和技术，二百亩丰产方获得大丰收，与丰产方外的棉花比较，多产一万二千八百斤皮棉。
        红专大课堂
    丰产方是大生产的组织形式，它要求有一支又红又专、有组织、有觉悟、纪律性强、战斗力强的队伍来管理。开始搞丰产方时，多数人不懂新技术，老农们虽然有些经验，但用来管理丰产方的生产就远远不足了。怎么办？社员一致要求学习。道东堡万亩棉花丰产方里首先建立了红专学校，队队建立技术组，组组有技术员，做到了技术进了丰产方。学习技术当中，首先遇到的困难就是文化水平低。有的社员说：“斗大的字还识不了两口袋，凭啥学技术！”社员们这种迫切要求提高文化水平的心情，使文化学习进了丰产方；爱跳爱唱是青年男女的特点，文化娱乐也随着进了方。
    老农林长润说：“在方一年，胜读十年书”。其实，岂止胜读十年书！1959年，仅道东堡的万亩棉花丰产方，就有二百七十五名社员达到普通技术员的水平；全社成千上万名十几岁的棉花姑娘，谈起棉花管理技术来，有理有据，滔滔不绝。集体劳动生活培养了社员们的集体主义思想和共产主义风格，他们互相帮助，紧密团结。
