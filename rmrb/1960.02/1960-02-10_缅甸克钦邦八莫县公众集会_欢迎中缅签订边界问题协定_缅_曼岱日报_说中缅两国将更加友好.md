Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, February 9th: According to a news communique issued by Burmese officials on the evening of February 8th, a public gathering with more than 3,000 participants was recently held in Bhamo County, Kachin State, Burma, to welcome the agreement between Burma and China on border issues.

The gathering, held on February 4th, was presided over by U Tun Tin, the county chief of Bhamo County. Representatives of various ethnic groups and religions in Bhamo, including Burmese, Chinese, Hindus, and Muslims, spoke at the meeting. They all emphasized that the reason the governments of Burma and China were able to successfully sign an agreement on the border issue between the two countries, which had not been resolved for nearly a hundred years, was because the two governments implemented fair and reasonable policies. Kachin State and the entire Burma are pleased with this achievement.

They said that this agreement is beneficial to both China and Burma, and the people of Kachin State sincerely hope that the friendship between Burma and China will be increasingly consolidated.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, February 8th: The Burmese "Mandalay Daily" published an editorial today pointing out that the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression is a treaty that is beneficial to both countries. The editorial expressed its belief that the understanding and sincerity between the two countries will be further enhanced in the future, and the two countries will be more friendly.

Regarding the agreement between China and Burma on border issues, the newspaper said that because both the Burmese government and the Chinese government are sincere, we believe that the final demarcation of the Sino-Burmese border will be smoothly resolved. The editorial said that after the completion of the demarcation work, the friendship and friendly relations between the two countries will have a solid foundation.
