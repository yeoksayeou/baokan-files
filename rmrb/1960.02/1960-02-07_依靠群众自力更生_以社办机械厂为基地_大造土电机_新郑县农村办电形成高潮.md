    Zhengzhou, February 6th (Reported by this newspaper) The People's Communes of Xinzheng County, Henan Province, taking commune-run machinery factories as their base, are vigorously building indigenous electric motors and small generators, rapidly setting off a high tide of nationwide electrification in the county. In just over two months, the county has produced 152 small electric motors ranging from five to twenty-five horsepower, with a total power generation capacity of 982 kilowatts. Currently, some of the county and commune industrial production in this county is using electricity as power, and people's communes and some production brigades have electric lights.

    Before November of last year, Xinzheng County only had a 60-kilowatt motor in the county-run flour mill for power generation, and there was no power generation equipment elsewhere. After the Party Central Committee issued a great call to the whole country to accelerate the realization of agricultural technological transformation, the county actively developed county and commune industries, vigorously carried out agricultural tool reforms, and established indigenous fertilizer, machinery, chemical and other industries in every commune. After these industries were launched using indigenous methods, they demanded the development of the electricity industry, so that they could gradually change from handicraft production to mechanized production, and from manual operation to electric drive.

    Based on the specific conditions of the county, the Xinzheng County Party Committee implemented the policy of "commune-run as the mainstay, small-scale as the mainstay, and water power as the mainstay" for rural electrification, following the principles of making do with whatever is available, starting with indigenous methods, moving from indigenous to modern, relying on the masses, and being self-reliant. From the county to the people's communes, people's electrification committees or electrification headquarters were established, led by the industrial secretaries of the county and commune Party committees, to lead this work, vigorously building indigenous electric motors and small electric motors.

    They first made an electric motor in Xin’dian People’s Commune, and then organized the masses to visit it, breaking the mysterious view of making electric motors and enhancing the confidence of the rural masses in doing electrification themselves.

    In the process of motor manufacturing, they relied on the collective research of blacksmiths, carpenters, coppersmiths, and silversmiths and other skilled craftsmen in various commune-run machinery factories, and then sent some people to visit and study outside to master motor manufacturing technology. The workers also made their own indigenous lathes, wire drawing machines and other indigenous machinery, solving the equipment needs for making electric motors. In terms of raw materials, based on the principle of equivalent exchange, the masses were mobilized to take out copper coins, copper plates, and broken copperware, and quickly collected more than 105,000 jin of copper, solving the main raw materials; at the same time, kerosene barrels, discarded water wheel pipes, and fire-baking cylinders were used to replace silicon steel sheets to make motor stators.

    After the technical hurdles and raw material supply problems were solved, each management area sent people with the raw materials they had collected to the commune machinery factory, using the motors manufactured by the commune machinery factory as a blueprint, and the skilled craftsmen of the machinery factory as teachers, to manufacture them in large quantities. This concentrated manpower and material resources, and also allowed for cooperation and mutual exchange, which made motor manufacturing progress very quickly. Many production brigades manufactured three five- to ten-horsepower motors in two weeks, and the quality was very good.

    Xinzheng County’s nationwide electrification movement has developed rapidly due to the above measures, and has now developed from using electricity for lighting to using it for production. In various communes throughout the county, motor manufacturing is also developing from small to large. In the past, they could only make motors of about ten horsepower, but now they can make motors of about twenty-five to one hundred horsepower. At first, they could only make squirrel-cage AC generators, but now they can make magnetoelectric generators and rectifier generators.

    Based on the development of the nationwide electrification situation in the county, the Xinzheng County Party Committee recently planned that by 1960, the entire county would use electric lights for lighting, all industrial production would use electricity, and some agricultural production would be electrified.

    依靠群众自力更生　以社办机械厂为基地　大造土电机
    新郑县农村办电形成高潮
    本报郑州6日电　河南省新郑县各人民公社以社办机械厂为基地，大造土电机和小型发电机，迅速在全县掀起了全民办电的高潮。仅两个多月的时间，全县就制成五到二十五马力的小电机一百五十二部，发电总容量达到九百八十二瓩。现在，这个县的县社工业生产已有一部分用电力做动力，各人民公社和一部分生产大队都用上了电灯。
    去年11月以前，新郑县还只有县营面粉厂的一部六十瓩电机发电，其他地方没有发电设备。当党中央向全国发出加速实现农业技术改造的伟大号召后，这个县积极发展了县社工业，大力进行农具改革，社社建立了土化肥、机械、化工等工业。这些工业土法上马以后，便要求发展电力工业，以便使它们逐步地由手工业生产改为机械生产，由人力操作改为电力带动。
    中共新郑县委会根据全县的具体情况，贯彻了“以社办为主，以小型为主，水力为主”的农村办电方针，因陋就简，土法上马、由土到洋的原则，依靠群众，自力更生，从县到人民公社都分别成立了全民办电委员会或办电指挥部，由县、社党委工业书记挂帅，领导这一工作，大造土电机和小型电机。
    他们首先在辛店人民公社制成一部电机，然后组织群众参观，打破制造电机的神秘观点，提高了农村群众自己动手办电的信心。
    在电机制造过程中，他们依靠各个社办机械厂的铁匠、木匠、铜匠、银匠等能工巧匠的集体研究，再派一些人到外面去参观学习，掌握电机制造技术。工人们又自己动手制造出土元车、拔丝机和其他土机械等，解决了制电机的设备需要。在原材料方面，以等价交换的原则，发动群众拿出铜钱、铜板和破旧的铜器，很快就收集了十万五千多斤铜，解决了主要的原材料；同时，又以煤油桶、废旧的水车管、烤火筒等代替矽钢片作成电机锭子。
    在技术关和原材料供应问题得到解决以后，各个管理区便派人带着自己搜集的原材料，集中到公社机械厂，以公社机械厂制造出来的电机为蓝本，以机械厂的能工巧匠为老师，大量制造。这样集中了人力、物力，又可以协作，互通有无，使电机制造进展得很快，不少生产大队在两个星期内就制造了三部五到十马力的电机，并且质量很好。
    新郑县的全民办电运动，由于采取了以上措施，发展迅速，现在已经由使用电力照明发展到用于生产。全县各个公社，电机制造也正在由小到大，以往只能造十马力左右的电机，现在已造二十五到一百马力左右的了；开初他们只能造鼠龙式的交流发电机，现在已能制造磁电机和整流发电机。
    中共新郑县委根据全县全民办电的发展情况，最近计划在1960年内，全县都要使用电灯照明，工业生产全部改用电力，并使部分农业生产实现电气化。
