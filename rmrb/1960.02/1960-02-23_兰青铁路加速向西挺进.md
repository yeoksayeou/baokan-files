Xinhua News Agency, Xining, February 22nd: The Lanqing Railway is continuing its westward advancement after reaching Xining. Currently, the roadbed construction for the 100-kilometer section between Xining and Haiyan has entered the stage of full-scale construction. Key projects such as the Zhama Long Tunnel complex, the Bayanxia Tunnel, and the Guanjiao Tunnel are also progressing rapidly, with some projects already completed.

To accelerate the construction progress, the railway workers have put forward the slogan of realizing "Four Modernizations" of mechanization, powerization, factoryization, and linkage, which has set off a new upsurge of technological innovation and launched new forms of competition such as "technology performance competitions" and "joint grand competitions," greatly accelerating the pace of the project. After the workers self-made frozen soil breaking machines and adopted the method of sawing frozen soil with electric saws, the efficiency of earth and stone work has been greatly improved.

    兰青铁路加速向西挺进
    新华社西宁22日电　兰青铁路通车西宁后继续向西挺进。目前西宁至海晏间一百公里线路的路基工程，已经进入全面施工阶段；扎麻隆隧道群、巴燕峡隧道和关角隧道等关键工程进展也很快，部分工程现在已经完工。
    为了加速施工进度，筑路职工提出了要实现机械化、动力化、工厂化、联动化的“四化”口号，掀起了技术革新的新高潮，并开展了“技术表演赛”、“联合大竞赛”等新的竞赛形式，大大加速了工程进度。工人们自制了打冻土机和采用电锯锯冻土的方法以后，使土石方工效大大提高。
