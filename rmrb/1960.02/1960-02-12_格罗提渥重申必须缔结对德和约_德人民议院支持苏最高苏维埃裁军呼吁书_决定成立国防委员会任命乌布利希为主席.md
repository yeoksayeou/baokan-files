Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 11th: The German Democratic Republic's People's Chamber held its tenth session on the 10th, which concluded that day.

    German Democratic Republic Premier Grotewohl delivered a statement on the German question on behalf of the government at the meeting. The meeting also passed a resolution responding to the Soviet Supreme Soviet's appeal to the parliaments and governments of all countries on the issue of disarmament.

    The statement said that the German people hope that the upcoming summit will make progress in preparing for the conclusion of peace treaties with the two Germanys. However, if the West German government does not change its current attitude, then the government of the German Democratic Republic will act in accordance with the interests of the entire nation and will have no choice but to conclude peace treaties separately with those countries that are willing to conclude peace treaties with it. This peace treaty will also resolve the West Berlin issue. Grotewohl also stated that the German Democratic Republic is willing to reach an understanding with those countries in the anti-Hitler coalition that believe they cannot currently conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic, on the basis of mutual concessions.

    Grotewohl said that we have heard with interest a suggestion that the Western countries' governments which are unwilling to conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic should conclude a peace treaty with the Federal Republic of Germany, while those governments willing to conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic should conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic. Grotewohl said that since these two peace treaties should resolve the same problems, they should in principle contain the same content and lead to the same results.

    Grotewohl emphasized that all of Berlin belongs to the territory of the German Democratic Republic, and West Berlin has never been part of the Federal Republic. He reiterated that the best way to solve the West Berlin issue is to make it a demilitarized free city.

    Grotewohl then spoke about the great peace initiatives proposed by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. He emphasized the great significance of the Soviet Union's recent decision to reduce its armed forces.

    Grotewohl said that the government of the German Democratic Republic welcomes the formation of an East-West ten-nation disarmament committee on an equal basis. It will closely monitor the committee's meetings and will do its best to ensure that the views and demands of the German people are understood by the meeting.

    Grotewohl pointed out that the Bonn government is not only openly accelerating atomic armament, but also trying to increase its conventional armaments. He pointed out that Bonn's aggressive conspiracies are doomed to failure. However, the danger from West Germany must not be underestimated. He said that if West Germany continues its nuclear armament and openly creates the prerequisites for attacking the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries, then we cannot ignore this, and we will be forced to take measures to defend the German Democratic Republic. Therefore, the government of the German Democratic Republic has submitted a bill on the establishment of a National Defense Council to the People's Chamber for approval. He believes that this measure will be supported by the people of the German Democratic Republic and the peace-loving people of West Germany and other countries.

    Grotewohl further said that the recent meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty member states in Moscow once again demonstrated the complete unity of the socialist countries in striving for the easing of the international situation, for disarmament, and for understanding among countries; it demonstrated their sympathy and support for the German nation's survival issues. The entire socialist camp stands united on the side of the German Democratic Republic's program for solving the German problem, which is of great help to the German Democratic Republic in opposing the Bonn militarist regime.

    The tenth session of the German Democratic Republic People's Chamber also unanimously adopted a resolution responding to the Soviet Supreme Soviet's appeal to the parliaments and governments of all countries.

    The resolution emphasized that the German people are very concerned about the issue of disarmament, because the German question can only be resolved through disarmament and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. The People's Chamber and government of the German Democratic Republic have put forward many positive proposals to West Germany regarding disarmament and the easing of tensions. However, the ruling groups in West Germany have rejected all these proposals and continue to pursue their arms policy. This forces other countries, including the German Democratic Republic, to take corresponding defense measures.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 11th: The German Democratic Republic People's Chamber passed a law on the establishment of the German Democratic Republic National Defense Council on the 10th at its tenth session.

    According to the proposal of the People's Chamber, the President of the Republic appointed Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and the First Deputy Premier of the Republic as the Chairman of the National Defense Council.

    The law passed by the People's Chamber states that, given that the current West German authorities are pursuing an aggressive imperialist policy, it is necessary to establish a National Defense Council to ensure unified guidance for the defense of the German Democratic Republic before the moment of German reunification arrives.

    The law stipulates that the National Defense Council shall consist of a chairman and at least twelve members. The chairman shall be appointed by the President of the Republic on the recommendation of the People's Chamber, and the members shall be nominated by the President. The National Defense Council is responsible to the Presidium of the People's Chamber. On the 10th, the Presidium of the People's Chamber also announced a resolution on the establishment of a permanent National Defense Council.

    格罗提渥重申必须缔结对德和约
    德人民议院支持苏最高苏维埃裁军呼吁书
    决定成立国防委员会任命乌布利希为主席
    新华社柏林11日电　德意志民主共和国人民议院10日举行了第十次会议，会议在当天结束。
    德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥代表政府在会上作了关于德国问题的声明。会议还通过决议，响应苏联最高苏维埃就裁军问题致世界各国议会和政府的呼吁书。
    声明说，德国人民希望，即将召开的最高级会议在准备对两个德国缔结和约方面取得进展。但是，如果西德政府不改变目前的态度，那么，德意志民主共和国政府将根据全民族的利益行事，不得不单独同那些愿意同它缔结和约的国家缔结和约。这个和约还将解决西柏林问题。格罗提渥同时表示，德意志民主共和国愿意在互相让步的基础上同反希特勒同盟中的那些认为它们现在不能同德意志民主共和国缔结和约的国家达成谅解。
    格罗提渥说，我们怀着兴趣听到这样一种建议：那些不愿意同德意志民主共和国缔结和约的西方国家政府，应当同德意志联邦共和国缔结和约，而那些愿意同德意志民主共和国缔结和约的政府则同德意志民主共和国缔结和约。格罗提渥说，这两个和约既然应该解决同样的问题，那么，它们在原则上也就应包含同样的内容，并将导致同样的结果。
    格罗提渥强调说，整个柏林属于德意志民主共和国的领土，西柏林从来不是联邦共和国的一部分。他重申，解决西柏林问题的最好办法是，使它成为一个非军事化的自由城市。
    格罗提渥接着谈到了苏联和其他社会主义国家所提出的伟大和平倡议。他强调指出苏联最近决定裁减武装部队的重大意义。
    格罗提渥说，德意志民主共和国政府欢迎在对等的基础上组成的东西方十国裁军委员会。它将密切注意这个委员会会议，并将尽力使得德国人民的见解和要求为会议所了解。
    格罗提渥指出，波恩政府不仅公然加速原子武装，而且竭力增加它的常规军备。他指出，波恩的侵略阴谋是注定要失败的。可是，决不能低估来自西德的危险。他说，如果西德继续进行核武装，并公开地为袭击德意志民主共和国和其他社会主义国家创造前提，那么我们不能对此置之不理，我们将被迫采取措施来保卫德意志民主共和国。因此，德意志民主共和国政府将一项关于成立国防委员会的法案提交人民议院批准。他认为，这个措施将得到德意志民主共和国人民和西德以及其它国家的爱好和平的人民的赞同。
    格罗提渥又说，最近在莫斯科举行的华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会会议再一次表明了社会主义国家在争取国际局势的缓和、争取裁军和各国间的谅解等问题上的完全一致；表明了它们对德意志民族生存问题所给予的同情和支持。整个社会主义阵营团结一致地站在德意志民主共和国解决德国问题的纲领这一方面，它对德意志民主共和国在反对波恩军国主义政权是一个极大的帮助。
    德意志民主共和国人民议院第十次会议还一致通过了一项决议，响应苏联最高苏维埃致世界各国议会和政府的呼吁书。
    决议强调指出，德国人民非常关心裁军问题，因为德国问题只有通过裁军和缔结对德和约才能获得解决。德意志民主共和国人民议院和政府曾经向西德提出了许多关于裁军及缓和紧张局势的积极建议。可是，西德的统治集团拒绝了所有这些建议，继续执行它们的军备政策。这迫使其他国家，其中包括德意志民主共和国，不得不采取相应的防御措施。
    新华社柏林11日电　德意志民主共和国人民议院10日在第十次会议上通过了一项关于成立德意志民主共和国国防委员会的法律。
    根据人民议院的建议，共和国总统已任命德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记、共和国第一副总理乌布利希为国防委员会的主席。
    人民议院所通过的法律说，鉴于目前西德当局奉行着侵略性的帝国主义政策，在德国得到重新统一这种时刻到来之前，有必要成立国防委员会来保证对德意志民主共和国的防御的统一指导。
    法律规定，国防委员会由主席和至少十二名委员组成。主席由共和国总统根据人民议院的建议任命，委员由总统提名。国防委员会对人民议院主席团负责。10日，人民议院主席团还公布了关于设立常设国防委员会的决议。
