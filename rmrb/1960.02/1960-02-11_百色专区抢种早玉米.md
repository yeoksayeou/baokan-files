Baise Special District Rushes to Plant Early Corn

(Our dispatch) The battle for the people of all ethnic groups in Baise Special District, Guangxi, to rush to plant early corn has begun. By February 1st, the entire special district had already planted 263,062 mu of early corn, accounting for 26% of the plan. Pingguo County, with the fastest progress, has overfulfilled its corn sowing task.

In order to strive for a bumper harvest of early corn, the sowing in various places is generally one solar term earlier than last year. On January 24th, Pingguo County convened a four-level cadre meeting to calculate tasks and seasonal accounts, and launched a major debate on whether early planting is good or late planting is good. Through the debate, the benefits of early planting were clarified, and they immediately devoted themselves to rushing to plant. The Mubi Pingmeng Commune originally decided to have a three-day holiday for the Spring Festival, but the masses only rested for two days, and on the third day, they automatically devoted themselves to rushing to plant. The Party Committee Secretaries of the fifteen communes and the branch secretaries of the eighty-eight brigades in Tianyang County all participated in rushing to plant, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses, and the daily progress increased from the original 1,000 mu to 3,346 mu.

During the rush planting, all localities also paid attention to specifications and quality. According to inspections by various communes in Jingxi County, the more than 10,000 mu of corn that have been planted are of good quality. The corn planted earlier in Xinxu Commune has grown three or four leaves and is lush green.

    百色专区抢种早玉米
    本报讯　广西百色专区各族农民抢种早玉米的战斗开始了。到2月1日，全专区已经种下早玉米二十六万三千零六十二亩，占计划26％。进度最快的平果县已超额完成了玉米播种任务。
    为了争取早玉米大丰收，各地下种普遍比去年提早一个节令。平果县在1月24日召开了四级干部会，算任务、算季节账，开展早种好还是晚种好的大辩论，通过辩论，明确了早种的好处，立即投入抢种。睦边平孟公社原来决定春节放假三天，但群众只休息了两天，第三天便自动投入抢种。田阳县十五个公社的党委书记和八十八个大队的支部书记都参加抢种，大大鼓舞了群众的热情，日进度由原来的一千亩增加到三千三百四十六亩。
    在抢种当中，各地还注意规格质量。据靖西县各公社检查，已种下的一万多亩玉米，质量都很好。新墟公社种得较早的玉米，已长三、四张叶子，一片葱绿。
