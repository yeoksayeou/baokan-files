Everything for High Speed
Zhao Zheng
Secretary of the CCP Yellow River Qing Tongxia Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau Committee
Director of the Yellow River Qing Tongxia Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau

The great development of industry and agriculture in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region urgently requires the full utilization of natural resources – water – to expand irrigation areas and increase power supply. The Yellow River Qing Tongxia Water Conservancy Hub Project was launched on August 26, 1958, in such a situation, based on exploration and design data, after more than two months of simple preparation.

Qing Tongxia is a large-scale, comprehensive water conservancy hub project focusing on irrigation. After completion, it can expand the irrigation area of farmland by six million mu, and also generate electricity and facilitate navigation, making it a major event in the lives of the Hui and Han people of Ningxia. In order to complete the Qing Tongxia project as soon as possible, under the correct leadership of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Ministry of Water and Electricity, we broke superstitions, emancipated our minds, and used creative labor to overcome the broken geological conditions of the dam foundation, the rare large fault, and particularly serious underground seepage, as well as the various obstacles of a few people on these key issues, and adhered to the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results and the glorious banner of the Great Leap Forward.

At the beginning of the construction, due to the short preparation time and poor equipment, some people doubted whether the start of construction at that time was too early. Why did this doubt arise? This is because we had no foreign equipment at the time, very few technical personnel, and all our assets were only eleven cars, two bulldozers, 191 kilowatts of power generation equipment, and dozens of technicians above the fourth grade. However, we resolutely implemented the instructions of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, actively prepared, and quickly started construction. After the start of construction, we promoted the acceleration of preparatory work. Revolution cannot be done only after everything is ready, but should start with certain conditions first, and then further prepare in the process of doing it. Guided by this thought, we formulated a construction policy of starting with indigenous methods first, gradually mechanizing, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and diversifying methods, adhering to putting politics in command, vigorously launching mass movements, and vigorously carrying out technical innovation. Not long after the start of construction, due to the lack of equipment and materials, we were unable to use sand and gravel cofferdams or wooden cage cofferdams like other water conservancy construction sites. We mobilized the masses to summarize the rich water management experience of the Hui and Han people of Ningxia for many years, and for the first time made the largest grass and soil cofferdam in the country, forming the first phase of the foundation pit and gaining time. Immediately afterwards, the stone excavation and concrete pouring of the main project began quickly. To pour concrete, we had very few concrete workers, rebar workers, and carpenters. What should we do? We poured a piece in advance and used it as a laboratory to train cadres. Lacking technicians to operate the machines, the master workers slept next to the machines, guiding the apprentices in operation at any time, and also ran various short-term training courses. In this way, after more than a year of effort, we have cultivated a technical team of nearly 4,000 people who can basically meet the needs of the project. At the same time, during the construction process, we received the cordial concern of the central government and the enthusiastic help of the people across the country. Complete sets of equipment, a large amount of materials, and various technical personnel were sent from all over the country. The Hui and Han people of the Autonomous Region showed great concern and gave the greatest care in terms of manpower and materials. All this has enabled us to win a great victory in the high-speed construction of Qing Tongxia.

In the construction of the Qing Tongxia Water Conservancy Project, the longest and most intense debate was about the method of fault treatment. The geological conditions of Qing Tongxia are complex, with large and numerous faults, and many karst caves. To save time and carry out high-speed construction, we must have correct views and methods for fault treatment. On this issue, a struggle between two lines and two ideologies unfolded. One type of person treated new things with an empiricist way of thinking and a lazy attitude. They believed that fault treatment was a complex technical problem that others had studied for twenty years without completely solving, and that our faults were so wide that it was impossible to determine how much pressure the filling material inside the fault could withstand. Therefore, we had to follow existing experience. Another type of person proceeded from reality, correctly treated existing experience based on the specific conditions of Qing Tongxia, considering both the adverse conditions caused by the existence of faults and the many conservative aspects of existing treatment methods. This ideological struggle lasted for nearly a year. It was not until after studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and after improving our understanding, that we made a new plan for dealing with faults through specific and detailed research work and critically learning from existing experience. This reduced the amount of excavation by more than nine-tenths compared to the original plan, saving more than one million yuan in investment, and more importantly, it could advance the construction period by more than a year. Here, we gained an important experience: when contradictions first appear, we must organize and guide the better development of contradictions, so that they can be more deeply exposed through intense and serious ideological struggle, unify understanding, and thus resolve contradictions. We should not be afraid of contradictions or intense debates in anything we do. Only through more debate can we more deeply discover the internal connections of things, unify our understanding more quickly, and fully promote the enthusiasm of the masses and rely on the strength and wisdom of the masses to solve contradictions.

The victory of the cutoff has boosted our new drive. Now, the project has entered a new and larger-scale construction phase. The task is even more arduous. We are determined to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, and strive to generate electricity as soon as possible and complete the Qing Tongxia Water Conservancy Hub Project half a year ahead of schedule.

    一切为了高速度
    中共黄河青铜峡水利工程局委员会书记
    黄河青铜峡水利工程局局长  赵征
    宁夏回族自治区工农业的大发展，迫切要求充分利用自然资源——水，来扩大灌溉面积，增加电力供应。黄河青铜峡水利枢纽工程正是在这样的形势下，根据勘探设计资料，经过两个多月的简单准备，在1958年8月26日开工的。
    青铜峡是个大型的、综合性的、以灌溉为主的水利枢纽工程。建成后可以扩大农田灌溉面积六百万亩，还可以发电和航运，因而它是宁夏回、汉族人民生活中的一件大事。为了早日建成青铜峡工程，我们在中共宁夏回族自治区委员会和水电部的正确领导下，破除了迷信，解放了思想，以创造性的劳动，突破了坝基地质破碎、少有的大断层和特别严重的地下渗水以及少数人在这些关键性问题上的多方阻碍，坚持了多快好省的建设社会主义总路线和大跃进的光辉旗帜。
    开工初期，由于准备时间短，设备差，有些人曾怀疑当时就开工是不是早了。为什么会有这种怀疑呢？这是因为我们当时没有什么洋设备，技术人员也很少，全部家当才有十一辆汽车、两台推土机、一百九十一瓩的发电设备、几十个四级以上的技工。但是，我们坚决贯彻了自治区党委的指示，积极准备，很快开工，开工后促进准备工作加速进行。革命不可能把一切准备好了才干，而是有了一定的条件先干起来，在干的过程中再进一步做准备。在这个思想指导下，我们制订了土法先上马，逐步机械化，土洋结合，方法多样化的施工方针，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动和大搞技术革新。开工不久，由于设备少，材料不足，我们没有可能像别的水利工地那样，利用砂石围堰或木笼围堰，我们就发动群众总结了宁夏回、汉族人民多年来丰富的治水经验，第一次做成了全国最大型的草土围堰，形成了第一期基坑，争取了时间。接着很快就开始了主体工程的石方开挖和混凝土的浇注。要浇混凝土，我们的混凝土工、钢筋工、木工都很少，怎么办？我们就提前先浇一块，把它当作实验室，来训练干部。要开机器缺乏技工，老师傅就睡在机器旁边，随时指导徒工操作，并且开办了各种短期训练班。就这样，经过一年多的努力，已培养出一支能基本适应工程需要的近四千名技术队伍。同时，在建设过程中，我们得到中央的亲切关怀和全国人民的热情帮助，成套的设备、大量的材料和各种技术人员从祖国各地送来，自治区的回、汉人民更是关心备至，在人力和物资上给予了最大的照顾。所有这一切，使我们争得了高速度建设青铜峡的巨大胜利。
    在青铜峡水利工程的建设中，争论最长、最激烈的莫过于断层处理的方法。青铜峡地质情况复杂，断层大而多，溶洞也不少，要争取时间，进行高速度的建设，就必须对断层处理有正确的观点和方法。在这个问题上，展开了两条路线、两种思想的斗争。一种人以经验主义的思想方法，以懒汉的工作态度对待新事物。他们认为断层处理是个复杂的技术问题，别人研究了二十年还没有彻底解决，而我们的断层又是那样宽，断层内的充填物究竟能承受多大的压力无法搞清，因此只好沿用已有的经验。另一种人则从实际出发，根据青铜峡的具体情况，正确地对待已有的经验，既考虑由于断层的存在所引起的不利条件，也考虑已有的处理方法中许多保守的地方。这两种思想的斗争持续了将近一年的时间，直到学习了党的八届八中全会文件之后，在提高了认识的基础上，通过具体的、细致的研究工作，批判地学习已有的经验，才作出了处理断层的新方案。这比原来的方案减少开挖量十分之九以上，节约投资一百多万元，更重要的是工期可提前一年多。这里，我们得到一条重要的体验：在矛盾刚出现的时候，就必须组织引导把矛盾更好地展开，使它通过激烈而严肃的思想斗争更深刻地暴露出来，统一认识，从而解决矛盾。我们做任何事情都不要怕有矛盾，不要怕有激烈的争论，只有越争论才能越深入地发现事物内在的联系，才能更快地统一认识，也才能充分地推动群众的积极性，依靠群众的力量和智慧去解决矛盾。
    截流的胜利鼓起了我们的新的干劲。现在，工程跨入了一个新的更大规模的施工阶段。任务更加繁重。我们决心高举毛泽东思想的红旗，发扬不断革命的精神，为争取及早发电和提前半年建成青铜峡水利枢纽工程而奋勇前进。
