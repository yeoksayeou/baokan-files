    "哪" and "那"
    In the People's Daily on February 10th, on the fourth page, there was a title that read: "哪里有病有伤，哪里有医有药" (Wherever there is illness or injury, there is medicine and doctors). I think the first "哪" is used appropriately, but the second "哪" is used incorrectly and should be changed to "那." "哪" is an interrogative pronoun, while "那" is a demonstrative pronoun. The meaning of the title is clearly "In the places where there is illness or injury, there are doctors and medicine," so the second "那里" (there) refers to a specific place and cannot use the generic "哪" (where). In fact, there is also a difference in pronunciation between these two characters.
    Currently, some people use "那" to also stand in for "哪," which has historical roots. However, using "哪" to replace "那" is not permissible.

### “哪”和“那”

    “哪”和“那”
    人民日报2月10日第四版有一个标题是：“哪里有病有伤，哪里有医有药”。我认为前面的“哪”字用得恰当，而后面一个“哪”字则用错了，应改为“那”字。“哪”是疑问代词，而“那”则是指示代词。这个标题的意思显然是“在有病有伤的地方就有医有药”，所以后面的“那里”实有所指，不可用泛指的“哪”字。其实这两个字在发音上也是有区别的。
    目前也有人用“那”字兼代“哪”字的，这还有历史根源。但用“哪”代替“那”则是不可以的。
