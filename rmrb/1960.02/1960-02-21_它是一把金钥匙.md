Column: Party Secretary's Notes

	It Is A Golden Key
	Zhao Ren, First Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Songjiang County Committee
	Miraculous water, immortal elixir, and lingzhi grass,
	Not as good as Chairman Mao's works,
	It is a golden key,
	Studying it opens the mind.

This folk song speaks of the profound understanding gained after studying Mao Zedong's works. Indeed, Comrade Mao Zedong's rich theoretical works are truly a brilliant guiding light and a sharp ideological weapon. A revolutionary cadre, as long as they work hard and study diligently, can invigorate their spirit, broaden their horizons, and make their work always proactive and invincible.

With the emergence of the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, rural cadres in Songjiang County felt an increasingly urgent need to study Mao Zedong's works. In the spring of 1958, the Party put forward the general line of building socialism, and the cadres and masses were overjoyed, with soaring enthusiasm for production. The road to construction became clearer, and the pace of the leap forward accelerated. At that time, agricultural production took the lead, and other work followed in full swing. The new tasks assigned to grassroots cadres were very heavy. How to lead the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in grassroots work was a new test they faced. In their work, they generally felt that two problems were more prominent: one was the heavy tasks, poor foresight, and passive response, like beginners in chess, not knowing what to do after taking one step; the other was that after being busy for a while, they couldn't distinguish between right and wrong in their work, not knowing what they had done right, why it was right, what they had done wrong, and why it was wrong. In short, the work was in an unconscious state.

At this time, everyone began to feel that their leadership level was not in line with the rapidly changing situation. Without serious study, they would not be able to do their work well, they would lag behind, and even lose their way and make political mistakes. Therefore, studying theory, studying Mao Zedong's works, became everyone's urgent need. They reflected: "Tasks are new every day, thinking is not improved, methods are old, how can we do without studying?" Therefore, most grassroots cadres, based on the principle of combining theory with practice, studied while working. For nearly two years, rural cadres in Songjiang County have successively studied Mao Zedong's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "Introducing a Cooperative," and other articles, as well as instructions on breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, continuously making revolution, and overcoming rightist tendencies; some cadres have also independently studied several articles in the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." After studying the theory and then guiding practice, everyone felt it was particularly effective and very effective.

Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of continuous revolution has been most deeply felt and most enlightening to everyone. In the Xuejia Production Team of Chengxi People's Commune, the team cadres were very ambitious and worked hard from the beginning of the Great Leap Forward, striving to be the best, but they could never achieve it, and everyone was very depressed. Later, after studying the theory of continuous revolution, they found the root cause of the problem, which was their short-sightedness, not looking far enough, and only considering today without considering tomorrow. They realized that in the era of the Great Leap Forward, comrades who hold leadership positions should stand high, see far, take one step and look two steps, so that movements can follow one after another, and victories can also follow one after another. In their actual work, they constantly put forward new battle slogans and continuously organized mass movements, thereby opening up the work situation and quickly turning from passive to active. At present, the Xuejia Production Team has become an advanced production team in the entire commune, leading in everything, being proactive in everything, and its work is developing rapidly.

Cadres who study and master the theory of continuous revolution will become ambitious, energetic, never satisfied, and constantly create miracles. Chen Shenglong, who was recently named a Red Flag Youth Shock Worker by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, is a prominent example. Chen Shenglong is the director of the Youth Pig Farm in Caowa People's Commune, Songjiang County, and is also a pig-raising expert in the farm. After studying the theory, he realized that pig raising also requires continuous revolution in order to make greater contributions to the Party. He said: "When I became the director of the pig farm, I always felt that there were many problems. After the old problems were solved, new problems arose. The theory of continuous revolution illuminated my heart and made me understand that solving a problem means that the Party's cause has taken a step forward." Therefore, after continuously overcoming difficulties such as pig seedlings, pig sheds, pig feed, and pig diseases, he began to solve the problem of feeding management. In Chen Shenglong's words: "The commune is raising pigs on a large scale, and the old methods of pig raising during the advanced cooperative period must also be changed." Under the arming of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, after painstaking research, he systematically summarized the living habits of pigs, and according to the different characteristics of sows, boars, meat pigs, farrowing pigs, and piglets, he finally created a set of scientific classification and specialized shed feeding management methods, providing good experience for the high-speed development of the pig-raising industry.

Comrade Mao Zedong's theory on the transformation of contradictions, that bad things can turn into good things, and that backwardness can be transformed into advancement, has also been very enlightening to other comrades. Two days after the summer solstice in 1958, I went to Guangming Advanced Cooperative (now Guangming Production Team of Chengbei People's Commune) in Chengbei Township to check on work and found that a rice field was very roughly cultivated. The soil clods were not broken up, and the seedlings were not transplanted neatly. After inquiry, I learned that some people here believed that the seedlings transplanted before the summer solstice could achieve a Great Leap Forward; while the seedlings transplanted after the summer solstice could not achieve a Great Leap Forward. This field was transplanted after the summer solstice, so it was done carelessly, and technical operating procedures were no longer seriously implemented. From dissecting this sparrow, we understood that we must criticize the new conservative ideas that have emerged in the new situation. At that time, we educated grassroots cadres to seriously study Comrade Mao Zedong's theory on the transformation of contradictions. Through study, everyone realized that not mastering the season and transplanting seedlings after the summer solstice were unfavorable conditions, but unfavorable conditions could also be transformed into favorable conditions. Everyone also realized that the key to transformation is to give full play to people's subjective initiative: if the masses are fully mobilized, cultivated carefully, fertilized sufficiently, and watered adequately, not only can the congenital deficiencies be overcome, but it is also possible to catch up; on the contrary, if one is complacent and slack, and relaxes later management, even seedlings transplanted before the summer solstice may be transformed into third-class seedlings. After the study, many cadres took the fields transplanted after the summer solstice as their experimental fields, carefully cultivated them, without slackening a step or missing a link, and persisted until the autumn harvest. As a result, the growth of the rice seedlings and the yield of those who did this were not much different from those of the early plantings. From then on, cadres in Songjiang County regarded third-class seedlings as experimental fields and constantly promoted third-class seedlings, which became an experience in leading the agricultural Great Leap Forward. The commune members said: "The Communist Party cadres are getting better and better, using poor fields as experiments, upgrading third-class seedlings, showing real skills."

It is a superstition that rural grassroots cadres have a low cultural level and cannot learn theory. Many facts have proved that rural grassroots cadres can not only learn theory, but also learn it very well. Because practice is the basis of theory. The so-called correct theory is nothing more than a scientific summary of human practical experience and a correct reflection of the laws of things. Therefore, we often say: "Practice produces theory, and there is philosophy in experimental fields." A revolutionary cadre who participates in the practice of class struggle and production struggle all year round has rich practical experience. This fact itself shows that we are fully capable of learning theory well. As long as we seriously study, work hard, and summarize and scientifically generalize practical experience on this basis, and raise it to the level of theory, and then use it to guide practice, our theoretical level and work level can be continuously improved.

We deeply realized that once the theory is grasped by the masses, it will produce a tremendous material force, which is an irrefutable truth. In the new year, we must, on the original basis, set off a new upsurge in studying Mao Zedong's works, and persist in it to continuously improve our ideological level. As our ideological level continues to improve, our cause will continue to triumph.

    它是一把金钥匙
    中共上海市松江县委第一书记　赵仁
    神水仙丹灵芝草，
    不及主席著作好，
    它是一把金钥匙，
    学了思想大开窍。
    这首民歌，说的是学习毛泽东著作以后的深刻体会。的确，毛泽东同志丰富的理论著作，真是光辉的指路明灯，锐利的思想武器。一个革命干部，只要下苦功，认真学习，就能振作精神，开阔眼界，使自己的工作永居主动，无往不胜。
    松江县农村干部学习毛泽东著作，随着农业生产大跃进的新形势的出现，越来越迫切了。1958年春天，党提出了建设社会主义的总路线，干部群众欢欣鼓舞，生产热情高涨；建设路子更加明确了，跃进速度更加加快了。当时，农业生产一马当先，其它工作万马奔腾，基层干部担负新的任务非常吃重。如何来领导基层工作全面大跃进，这是他们面临的一个新的考验。在工作中，他们普遍感觉到有两个问题比较突出：一个是任务繁重，预见性差，被动应付，像初学象棋一样，走了上一步不知下一步该怎么走；另一个是忙了一阵以后，分不清自己工作中的是与非，不知到底哪些做对了，为什么对，哪些做错了，为什么错。总之一句话，工作处于不自觉状态。
    这时，大家开始感觉到自己的领导水平与一日千里的形势不相适应，不认真学习，就会做不好工作，就要落伍，甚至迷失方向，在政治上犯错误。因此，学习理论，学习毛泽东著作，成为大家的迫切要求。他们反映：“任务天天新，思想提不高，办法老一套，不学习怎么行？”于是，大部分基层干部根据理论与实践相结合的原则，一边工作一边学习起来了。将近两年来，松江县农村干部已先后学习了毛泽东同志的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”、“介绍一个合作社”等文章，以及关于破除迷信，解放思想，不断革命，克服右倾等指示；有的干部还自学了“毛泽东选集”中的若干篇文章。学习了理论，再去指导实践，大家都觉得特别有效，非常灵验。
    毛泽东同志关于不断革命的理论，大家的体会最深，思想上最开窍。城西人民公社有个薛家生产队，队干部都很有志气，大跃进开始，一直苦干实干，力争上游，可是，一直争不上去，大家很苦闷。后来学习了不断革命论，找到了病根，乃是目光短，看不远，干了今天就不考虑明天。他们认识到，在大跃进的年代，担任领导工作的同志应当站得高，看得远，走一步，看两步，使运动一个接一个，才能使胜利也一个接一个。他们在实际工作中，就不断提出新的战斗口号，连续组织群众运动，从而打开了工作局面，很快地从被动转变为主动。目前，薛家生产队已成为全公社的先进生产队，事事领先，样样主动，工作正在一日千里地向前发展。
    干部学习并掌握了不断革命论，就会变得志大劲足，雄心勃勃，永不满足，不断创造奇迹。最近被共青团上海市委员会命名为红旗青年突击手的陈胜龙，就是一个突出的例子。陈胜龙，是松江县漕洼人民公社青年养猪场的场长，也是这个场的养猪能手。他学习了理论以后，就认识到养猪这件事情，也要不断革命，才能对党作出更大的贡献。他说：“我担任了养猪场场长，开头总觉得问题多，老问题解决了，又产生了新问题，不断革命论照亮了我的心，懂得解决了一个问题，党的事业就前进了一步。”因此，他在连续攻克了猪苗、猪棚、猪饲料和猪病疫等难关后，又动手解决饲养管理问题。用陈胜龙的说法是：“公社大养猪，高级社时期的一套养猪老办法，也得变一变。”他在光辉的毛泽东思想的武装之下，经过刻苦钻研，系统地总结了猪的生活规律，根据母猪、公猪、肉猪、产猪、苗猪的不同特点，终于创造了一套科学的分类专棚饲养管理方法，为高速度发展养猪事业提供了良好的经验。
    毛泽东同志关于矛盾转化，坏事可以变好事，落后可转化为先进的理论，对别的同志也有很大启发。1958年夏至后两天，我到城北乡光明高级社（现在是城北人民公社光明生产队）检查工作，发现有一块水稻田耕作非常粗糙，土块没有耙碎，秧苗也插得很不整齐。一了解，原来这里有些人认为夏至以前插的秧，能够大跃进；而夏至以后插的秧，就不能大跃进了。这块田是过了夏至插秧，所以就马马虎虎，不再认真执行技术操作规程了。从解剖这一只麻雀中，使我们理解到，必须批判在新的情况下产生的新的保守思想。当时，我们就教育基层干部，要认真学习毛泽东同志关于矛盾转化的理论。通过学习，大家认识到，季节没有掌握住，夏至后插秧，是不利的条件，但不利条件也可以转化为有利条件。大家还认识到，转化的关键是发挥人的主观能动性：如果充分发动群众，精耘细耥，肥多水足，不但可以克服先天不足的缺陷，而且还可能做到后来居上；相反，如果自满松劲，放松后期管理，即便是夏至以前插的秧，也可能转化为三类苗。学习以后，许多干部都把夏至以后插秧的田作为自己的试验田，精心培育，一步不松，一环不漏，一直坚持到秋收。结果，凡是这样做的，稻苗生长情况和早种的并没有多大分别，产量也是平起平坐的。从这以后，松江县干部把三类苗作为试验田，不断促进三类苗，便成为领导农业大跃进的一项经验。社员说：“共产党的干部越来越好，把差的田作试验，三类苗升级，显出了真本领。”
    农村基层干部文化水平低，不能学理论，这是一种迷信。许多事实证明，农村基层干部不但能够学理论，而且可以学得很好。因为实践是理论的基础。所谓正确的理论，无非是人类实践经验的科学总结，是事物发展规律的正确反映。所以，我们常常说：“实践出理论，试验田头有哲学。”一个革命干部，一年到头参加阶级斗争和生产斗争的实践，具有丰富的实践经验，这个事实的本身，就说明了我们完全能够学好理论。只要在这一基础上，认真学习，刻苦钻研，把实践经验加以总结和科学概括，使之上升为理论，再去指导实践，我们的理论水平和工作水平就能够不断提高。
    我们深刻地体会到，理论一旦为群众所掌握，就会产生巨大的物质力量，真是颠扑不破的真理。在新的一年中，我们一定要在原有基础上，掀起一个新的学习毛泽东著作的高潮，并且坚持下去，不断提高我们的思想水平。我们的思想水平不断提高，我们的事业就能不断胜利。
