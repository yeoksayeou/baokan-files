Cultural Flowers Bloom Throughout the Garden
    ——A Record of the Xia Yang Livestock Production Team After Eliminating Illiteracy
    By Our Correspondent Liao Youbin
    In the Haergao People's Commune of Kulun Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, there is a Xia Yang Livestock Production Team. When people walk into the village where this production team is located, they feel surrounded by poetry and picturesque scenery. The people living here were already good at singing and dancing, and after basically eliminating illiteracy among the young and middle-aged last year, their cultural life has become even richer and more colorful.

    Good at Singing and Dancing

    Paired up in twos,
    Men and women dance together,
    Singing praises of our benefactor, Chairman Mao,
    Because we have him,
    Our lives have something to rely on….

    This is the lyric of the Mongolian "Andai Dance." As the song goes, the dance also changes. Men, women, old and young, all smile, waving red and green handkerchiefs, sometimes forming a shape of unity, and sometimes transforming into a lotus shape, truly dazzling the eyes.

    "Andai Dance" is an ancient dance of the Mongolian people. Two hundred years ago, the Mongolian people here, like now, could all dance the "Andai Dance." However, the feudal rulers of the Qing Dynasty believed that so many people singing and dancing together was an intentional act of solidarity to resist, so they issued a decree prohibiting it. In addition, the people's lives became increasingly impoverished, and most families successively went down the mountain to escape the famine. From then on, the beautiful dance of the "Andai Dance" could no longer be seen. After liberation, production developed and the people's lives continued to improve. All 354 young and middle-aged people in the production team participated in cultural learning, and after most of them got rid of the label of illiteracy, they urgently demanded cultural entertainment. The young people then automatically organized amateur writing groups, compiling more than 5,000 poems, dances, and scripts. During festivals and weekend evenings, men and women dressed in red and green would dance and sing again. La Sheng Menghe Jinmu, an elderly Mongolian man in his sixties living in the village, could not help but feel itchy, and happily stepped onto the stage to dance the "Andai Dance" he had learned in his youth. From then on, the long-lost "Andai Dance" regained its youth.

    Now, most of the young and middle-aged people in the Xia Yang Livestock Production Team are continuing to study junior high school and senior elementary school courses, and their cultural level is gradually improving. They have successively created many excellent literary and artistic works. In less than two years, they have created more than 15,000 literary novels, poems, dances, operas, dramas, art works, and Haolaibao (storytelling). Every weekend, they dance gracefully and everyone sings, like a literary and art festival.
Poetry village
The sun comes out bright,
New clothes fill the closet, grain fills the granary,
People live a good life,
All thanks to the savior, the Communist Party.

    Walking into the village where the Xia Yang Livestock Production Team is located, it is truly a garden full of poetry and paintings, with poems everywhere. After reading the poems of this family, the poems of another family appear before your eyes, you can't finish reading them, you can't count them all. Not only in the village, but also at the winter water conservancy construction site in the field, you can also see many magnificent poems praising the commune members' transformation of nature:

    The canal-building heroes have a firm will,
    We will build the canal to the sky,
    Drawing down the Milky Way from the sky,
    We will surely turn the desert into fertile fields.

    No one knows how many such inspiring poems there are here! No wonder the representatives from all over Inner Mongolia who attended the literacy elimination on-site conference praised this place as a poetry village.

    According to Danba Laxijie, the secretary of the production team's Party branch, no one in this village could read before liberation. After liberation, through years of literacy campaigns, especially the Great Leap Forward in 1958, 81.4% of the young and middle-aged people in the village got rid of the label of illiteracy. In order to consolidate the results, the Party branch called on the young and middle-aged people to read more, write more, and use more. More than 260 young and middle-aged people who had already entered junior high school and senior elementary school classes immediately responded, and they wrote a total of 5,000 poems in one year, an average of 18 poems per person. Nearly a hundred of them have been successively published in large literary and artistic publications such as "Flower Field of Inner Mongolia," "Inner Mongolia Youth," and "Hongyan." The Mongolian youth Erden Bala, who is known as a social amateur writer, wrote more than 400 poems, songs, and scripts in one year, of which more than 20 poems and scripts have been published in some major literary and artistic publications in Inner Mongolia.

    Sound of Reading Everywhere

    In the village of the Xia Yang Livestock Production Team, the sound of reading can be heard everywhere. Here, you can't see a single young or middle-aged person who hasn't gone to a private school. Some old people in their forties or even sixties also participated in the study. Now there are more than 390 people enrolled in the village, of which 75% have been promoted to senior elementary school and junior high school classes. Nearly one-third of the 260 households in the team have become "cultural families."

    I visited the home of Se Yin Bilige, the brave production team leader. Se Yin Bilige is in his thirties this year. When he was the production team leader in the elementary cooperative a few years ago, he was still illiterate. He couldn't understand the official documents from above, so he had to run five miles away to find someone to read them. It was also difficult to learn advanced production experience from other places, so he had to carry out extensive cultivation according to the old traditions. In 1956, he got rid of the label of illiteracy, especially after reading junior high school courses and learning some knowledge about desert management from the newspaper, he boldly led the Mongolian and Han commune members to plant trees along the edges of dozens of acres of farmland that were often attacked by the desert, and also planted sand-fixing grasses such as Salsola collina. These young trees have grown tall, and various sand-fixing aromatic grasses have grown all over the ground. The initial success in sand prevention has increased the grain yield per mu of farmland near the desert from dozens of kilograms in the past to more than 200 kilograms last year, achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest.

    Se Yin Bilige's younger brother, Bao Yin Tu, is also in junior high school this year. He is also very interested in the prevention and treatment of livestock diseases. He bought some books and studied them whenever he had time, and learned a lot about the prevention and treatment of livestock diseases. Last summer, 27 pigs raised in their team suffered from hog cholera. After Bao Yin Tu's treatment, none of them died.

    On the walls of Se Yin Bilige's house are posted challenge competition books and guarantees between the two brothers, the two sisters-in-law, and the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law in terms of production and cultural learning. Se Yin Bilige's parents guarantee to take good care of their grandchildren; the sons and daughters-in-law guarantee to be role models in production, housework, and cultural learning. In the competition, they all fulfilled their guarantees and became production models and cultural learning models in Kulun Banner, the commune, and the production team.

    Se Yin Bilige's home is just one of many "cultural families." In other families, some people have created and improved production tools such as four-share wooden plows and manure-spreading carts; some are creating literary works such as poems, novels, and dramas; and some are conducting plant grafting experiments in their home gardens.

    Now, 76 households in the Xia Yang Livestock Production Team have subscribed to more than ten newspapers and magazines and literary publications such as "People's Daily," "Inner Mongolia Daily," "China Youth Daily," "Red Flag," and "Party Education," and more than 400 people read them regularly. There are also five libraries and four clubs in the production team, which are open every day to fully meet the cultural and entertainment needs of the young and middle-aged people after eliminating illiteracy.

    文化花朵开满园
    ——记扫除文盲后的下养畜牧生产队
    本报记者　廖由滨
    内蒙古自治区库伦旗哈尔稿人民公社有个下养畜牧生产队。人们走进这个生产队所在的村庄，感到处处诗情画意。居住在这里的人们本来就能歌善舞，去年在青壮年中基本上扫除文盲以后，文化生活更加丰富多彩。
    能歌善舞
    成对成对的连起来，
    不分男女跳起来，
    歌唱恩人毛主席，
    有了他老人家哟，
    我们的生活就有了依靠……。
    这是蒙古族人民跳“安代舞”的歌词。随着歌声，舞姿也跟着变化。男女老幼个个眉开眼笑，手舞红、绿彩帕，时而组成团结形，霎时又变成荷花形，真使你眼花撩乱。
    “安代舞”，是蒙古族人民古老的舞蹈。二百年前，这儿的蒙古族人民和现在一样，人人都会跳“安代舞”。但是清朝封建统治者，认为这么多人一起唱歌跳舞，是有意团结起来反抗，便下了一道禁令；再加上人民的生活日渐贫困，大多数人家陆续下山逃荒，从此，再也看不到“安代舞”的美妙舞姿了。解放后，生产发展，人民生活不断改善，全生产队三百五十四名青壮年都参加了文化学习，绝大部分人摘掉文盲帽子后，迫切要求文化娱乐。青年们便自动组织起业余创作小组，编了诗歌、舞蹈和剧本五千多个，到了节日和周末晚会时，男男女女就穿红披绿地又舞又唱起来。住在村里的六十多岁的蒙古族老人拉生孟和金木言也不禁技痒，欣然登场跳出他们年轻时学的“安代舞”。从此，失传已久的“安代舞”又恢复了青春。
    现在，下养畜牧生产队的绝大部分青壮年在继续学习初中和高小课程，文化水平步步提高，又陆续创作了许多优秀文艺作品。在不到两年的时间就创作了文艺小说、诗、舞蹈、歌剧、话剧、美术作品和好来宝（说书）等达一万五千多个。每到周末，就翩翩起舞，人人歌唱，像文艺大会演。诗歌之乡太阳出来亮堂堂，新衣满柜粮满仓，人民生活过得好，
    全靠救星共产党。
    走进下养畜牧生产队所在的村庄，真是诗画满院，遍地皆诗。看完了这家的诗，另一家的诗又出现在眼前，看也看不完，数也数不尽。不仅是在村庄里，在野外冬修水利的工地上，也同样可以看到许多歌颂社员改造大自然的壮丽诗篇：
    修渠健儿意志坚，
    要把水渠修上天，
    引下天上银河水，
    定叫沙漠变良田。
    村里村外不知有多少这样激动人心的诗啊！怪不得在这里开扫除文盲现场会议的内蒙古各地的代表都称誉这里是个诗乡。
    据生产队党支部书记丹巴拉希杰谈，这个村在解放前根本没有一个人识字。解放后经过逐年的扫盲，特别是1958年的大跃进，全村81．4％的青壮年摘掉了文盲帽子。为了巩固成果，党支部号召青壮年多读、多写、多用。已经升入初中和高小班的二百六十多名青壮年立刻响应，一年中他们共写了五千首诗，平均每人写了十八首。其中陆续刊登在内蒙古“花的原野”、“内蒙古青年”和“鸿雁”等大型文艺刊物上的近百首。被誉称为社会业余作家的蒙古族青年额尔登巴拉，一年中就编写出了四百多首诗、歌和剧本，其中有二十多首诗和剧本已经在内蒙古的一些主要文艺刊物上登载了。
    处处读书声
    下养畜牧生产队的村庄，处处书声朗朗。在这里，看不见一个没有上民校的青壮年。有些四十多岁甚至六十岁的老年人也参加了学习。现在全村入学的就有三百九十多名，其中75％的人已升入了高小和初中班学习，全队二百六十户中近三分之一的户成了“文化之家”。
    我访问了勇敢生产小队长色音毕力格的家。色音毕力格今年三十多岁，前几年在初级社担任生产队长时，还不识字。上面来的公文看不懂，只好跑到五里外找人念。学习外地的先进生产经验也很困难，只好按照老传统进行粗放耕作。1956年，他摘掉了文盲帽子，特别是在读了初中课程，又从报纸上学到了治理沙漠的一些知识以后，就大胆地领导蒙汉族社员在常遭沙漠袭击的几十亩农田边沿上栽种了树木，还种植了莎蒿等固沙草。这些幼树都已长高，固沙的各种芳草也长满遍地。防沙初步成功，去年靠近沙漠边沿的农田每亩粮食产量由过去的几十斤提高到二百多斤，得到从未有过的大丰收。
    色音毕力格的弟弟宝音图，今年也读初中了。他还对家畜疫病防治很感兴趣，买了些书籍，一有时间就钻研，学到了不少防治牲畜疫病的知识。去年夏天，他们小队里饲养的二十七头生猪患猪瘟，经过宝音图的治疗，没有一头死亡。
    在色音毕力格家的墙壁上贴着兄弟俩、妯娌俩和婆媳之间在生产上和学文化上的挑战竞赛书、保证书。色音毕力格的父母保证把孙子带好；儿子和媳妇们不管在生产上，在家务劳动上，在学习文化上，保证要人人当模范。在竞赛中，他们都实现了自己的保证，分别当了库伦旗、公社和生产队的生产模范和学文化的模范。
    色音毕力格的家只是许多个“文化之家”中的一个。在其他家庭里，有的人创造和改制了四铧木犁、送粪车等生产工具；有的在创作诗歌、小说和戏剧等文艺作品；有的在家园里进行植物嫁接的试验。
    现在，下养畜牧生产队有七十六户分别订购“人民日报”、“内蒙古日报”、“中国青年报”、“红旗”、“党的教育”等十多种报刊杂志和文艺刊物，经常阅读的达四百多人。生产队里还有五个图书室和四个俱乐部，每天开放，以充分满足青壮年们在扫除文盲后的文化娱乐生活。
