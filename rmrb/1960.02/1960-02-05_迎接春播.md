Welcoming the Spring Planting

　　Today is "Start of Spring," and the second spring of the people's communes has arrived. The news of early rice transplanting from Hainan Island and the news of active preparations for spring plowing from Heilongjiang herald an important stage of continued agricultural production—spring planting—which will gradually unfold from south to north.

　　Since last winter, the mass movements for water conservancy construction and pig raising and manure accumulation across the country have achieved great success, laying a solid material foundation for this year's spring planting and the continued leap forward in agricultural production this year. The current task is to make persistent efforts, seize the time and do a good job early. We must arrange water, fertilizer, seeds, tools, and labor before the start of spring planting to ensure the successful progress of the spring planting work.

　　Of all the principles, putting politics in command is the most important. Before spring planting, it is necessary to carry out in-depth ideological work, vigorously publicize the great victory of last year's agricultural production, and publicize the favorable conditions and goals for this year's continued leap forward in agricultural production. It is necessary to clearly establish the idea of taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward among cadres and the masses, and make every effort to achieve sufficient water and fertilizer, tool innovation, deep plowing and early planting, and plant more and plant well. Judging from the recent experience of various places in organizing preparatory production, to make the vast number of cadres and commune members clearly establish the idea of taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward, it is necessary to combine the formulation of this year's production plans for communes and production teams and organize extensive discussions. It should be repeatedly explained to cadres and commune members that grain production is the head of agriculture. In our big country with a population of more than 600 million, vigorously developing grain production has extremely important political and economic significance, whether now or in the future. After a large increase in grain production, it will not only be able to supply the urban and rural people with abundant grain, but also drive the great development of industrial raw material crops and animal husbandry. Various cash crops are important industrial raw materials or non-staple foods. These products have increased to varying degrees in recent years, but they still cannot fully meet the growing needs. This requires taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing agricultural production. The continued leap forward in agricultural production in 1960 is to obtain much more grain than in the past, and to obtain much more oil crops, hemp, tea, flue-cured tobacco, sugar crops, silk, fruits, vegetables, medicinal materials, and other agricultural products than in the past.

　　The guiding ideology of taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward should be implemented in a series of specific preparations for spring planting.

　　To harvest more, we must plant more. First of all, we must find every way to expand the planting area of various crops. Not only should the planting area of grain crops be increased, but also the area of cash crops and feed crops should be increased. How can we expand the planting area? The most important thing is to make full use of existing cultivated land, expand the multiple cropping area, and make full use of all scattered land, so as to make the most of every inch of land. At the same time, reclaim wasteland in all areas where conditions permit. Liling County, Hunan Province, expanded the cultivated land area by 240,000 mu by reclaiming wasteland. In this way, not only the area of grain crops has been expanded from 540,000 mu last year to 737,000 mu, but also the planting area of cash crops, vegetables and feed has been greatly increased (see page 3 of this newspaper on February 1). Therefore, when making plans, all localities must ensure both a large planting area for grain crops and a certain planting area for other crops. Among grain crops, it is also necessary to rationally arrange the proportion of planting area of various grain crops, especially to ensure that high-yield crops have sufficient planting area.

　　Not only must we plant more, but we must also harvest more. Therefore, it is necessary to better implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, formulate specific measures to increase production, and increase the yield per unit area of various crops. In terms of water conservancy work, at present, we should concentrate our efforts on completing the water conservancy projects that will benefit this year, and accordingly repair the irrigation canals and level the land, so that the water conservancy projects are complete, and we should also seize the work of water storage and exert the irrigation effect as quickly as possible. All areas with irrigation conditions should immediately seize the time for spring irrigation; dry land should immediately check the soil moisture and take timely measures to preserve soil moisture to ensure timely spring planting. All areas where drought is emerging should immediately start drought prevention and drought resistance early to be prepared for any contingency. We must launch a vigorous upsurge of manure accumulation to prepare more and better fertilizers for grain crops and cash crops. In the manure accumulation movement, we must grasp the work of fertilizer production, accumulation, preservation, transportation, and application together. At present, special attention should be paid to doing a good job in transporting fertilizer, and the base fertilizer needed for spring planting should be sent to the fields as soon as possible. Taking close planting as an example, in 1959, all parts of the country promoted close planting measures in accordance with local conditions and achieved great results. There are many effective experiences in this work, which should be earnestly and universally promoted. Taking the promotion of improved varieties as an example, the promotion of improved varieties last year has been quite common, but there is still much work to be done, and the potential for increasing production in this area is still very large. For example, the promotion of excellent varieties of corn can increase production by 20% to 30% compared with ordinary varieties. Even for improved varieties that have already been promoted, if they are further carefully selected to improve the quality of improved varieties, the effect of increasing production will be even greater. In addition, other items in the "Eight-Point Charter" also need to be carefully prepared and implemented.

　　Planting more and planting well is an extremely arduous task. Labor will certainly appear to be insufficient. However, judging from the current situation, the conditions for solving this problem are better than before. The further play of the superiority of the people's communes "large in size and collective in nature" enables us to mobilize forces from all sides to strive for the victory of spring planting. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the experience in agricultural tool reform has become richer and richer. The current solution to the problem of insufficient labor, in addition to rational allocation of labor, is to vigorously carry out tool reform, accelerate the manufacture and promotion of new agricultural tools most needed in spring planting, and at the same time seize the repair and manufacture of old agricultural tools and small agricultural tools. The agricultural machinery put into the countryside this year will have a significant increase. Therefore, strengthening the training of mechanical technicians and doing a good job in the supply and storage of mechanical fuel and parts should attract the attention of local leading organs and people's communes. The more thorough these specific organizational work is arranged, the greater the role agricultural machinery will play in spring plowing production.

　　The spring light is pressing, and time waits for no one. We must seize the spring planting work tightly and relentlessly, and strive for initiative. Jinpu Commune, Chaoyang County, a late rice 1,000-jin commune in Guangdong Province in 1959, is determined to make the yield of early rice this year exceed the yield of late rice last year, and is determined to break the old rules of "early four and late six." They completed the preparations for spring plowing half a month in advance. On the first day after the Spring Festival holiday, all the commune members immediately launched a spring plowing upsurge to win a good start, sowing the first batch of seeds to strive for a bumper harvest this year. Such a spirit of setting great ambitions, boosting morale, striving for the top, and racing against time is worthy of emulation by all people's communes. All localities should fully mobilize the masses, immediately implement the production plan to the teams, and implement the measures to increase production to the fields. Solve any problems that arise; overcome any difficulties that arise. We must launch a vigorous and down-to-earth upsurge of preparatory plowing to welcome spring planting.

    迎接春播
    今天是“立春”，人民公社化的第二个春天已经来到。从海南岛传来的早稻插秧的消息，从黑龙江传来的积极准备春耕的消息，预告农业生产继续跃进的一个重要的阶段——春播，就要从南到北逐步展开。
    去冬以来，全国各地兴修水利、养猪积肥的群众运动取得极大的成就，为今年春播、为今年农业生产继续跃进作了雄厚的物质准备。现在的任务就是要再接再厉，抓早抓好，一定要在春播开始之前，把水，肥，种子，工具，劳力等等安排就绪，保证春播工作胜利进行。
    千条万条，政治挂帅是第一条。春播之前要进行深入的思想工作，大张旗鼓地宣传去年农业生产的伟大胜利，宣传今年农业生产继续跃进的有利条件和奋斗目标。要在干部和群众中明确地树立起以粮为纲全面跃进的思想，尽一切的努力作到水足肥丰，工具革新，深耕早播，种多种好。从最近各地组织备耕生产的经验看，要使广大干部和社员明确树立以粮为纲全面跃进的思想，必须结合制定今年公社和生产队的生产计划，广泛组织讨论。应当向干部和社员反复说明，粮食生产是农业之首，在我们这个有着六亿多人口的大国里，大力发展粮食生产，不论现在或今后都有着十分重大的政治意义和经济意义。粮食大量增产以后，不但能够供应城乡人民以丰富的粮食，而且还可以带动工业原料作物和畜牧业的大发展。各种经济作物是重要的工业原料或是副食品，这些产品几年来都有了不同程度的增产，但还不能充分满足日益增长的需要。这就要求以粮为纲，全面发展农业生产。1960年农业生产的继续跃进，就是要拿到比过去多得多的粮食，拿到比过去多得多的油料、麻类、茶叶、烤烟、糖料、蚕丝、果品、蔬菜、药材和其他各种农产品。
    以粮为纲，全面跃进的指导思想应当贯彻在春播的一系列的具体准备工作中。
    多收就必须多种。首先要想一切办法扩大各种作物的播种面积，不但粮食作物的播种面积应当增加，经济作物和饲料作物的面积也应当增加。怎样才能扩大播种面积呢？最主要的是充分利用现有耕地，扩大复种面积，充分利用一切零散土地，做到见缝插针，寸土不让。同时在一切条件许可的地区开垦荒地。湖南醴陵县就用开垦荒地的办法，全县扩大耕地面积二十四万亩。这样，不但粮食作物面积从去年的五十四万亩扩大到七十三万七千亩，而且经济作物、蔬菜和饲料播种面积也都有很大增加（见2月1日本报第三版）。因此，各地在作规划的时候，一定要做到既保证粮食作物的大量的播种面积，又保证其他作物的一定的播种面积。在粮食作物中，也要合理安排各种粮食作物播种面积的比重，特别是要保证高产作物有足够的播种面积。
    既要多种，还要多收。因此，必须更好地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，制定出各项具体增产措施，提高各种作物的单位面积产量。就水利工作来说，目前应该集中力量去完成当年受益的水利工程，并且相应地修好灌溉渠道，平整好土地，使水利工程成套，并且抓紧蓄水工作，最快地发挥灌溉效果。凡是有灌溉条件的地区应当立即抓紧春灌；旱地应当立即查验墒情，及时采取保墒措施，保证适时春播。凡是旱象露头的地区要立即提早防旱抗旱，做到有备无患。要掀起热火朝天的积肥高潮，为粮食作物和经济作物准备更多更好的肥料。要在积肥运动中作到：造肥、积肥、保肥、运肥、施肥工作一齐抓。当前要特别注意做好运肥的工作，要把春播时需用的底肥赶紧送到地里去。再以密植来说，1959年全国各地因地制宜地推广密植措施，取得了很大的成绩。这项工作中有许多行之有效的好经验，应当认真地普遍推广。再以推广良种工作来说，去年良种的推广已经相当普遍，但是还有许多工作可以做，这方面的增产潜力还很大。比如推广玉米的优良品种，就可比一般品种增产百分之二三十。就是已经推广的良种，如果再加精选，提高良种质量，增产的效果也会更大些。此外，“八字宪法”中其他各项，也同样需要认真作好准备，贯彻实施。
    种多种好，这是一件极其繁重的任务。劳力当然会显得不足。但是从当前的情况来看，解决这个问题的条件比以前更好了。人民公社“一大二公”优越性的进一步发挥，使我们能够调动各方面的力量争取春播的胜利。特别是从1958年大跃进以来，农具改革经验越来越丰富。当前解决劳力不足的办法，除了合理安排劳力外，就是大搞工具改革，加速制造和推广春播中最需要的新式农具，同时抓紧修补、制造旧式农具和小型农具。今年投入农村中的农业机械将有显著的增加，因此，加紧培训机械技术人员，作好机械燃料和零件的供应和储备，应该引起各地领导机关和人民公社的重视。这些具体的组织工作安排得越周到，农业机械在春耕生产中发挥的作用也越大。
    春光逼人，时不我待。必须把春播工作抓紧抓狠，力争主动。1959年广东省的一个晚稻千斤公社——潮阳县金浦公社决心要使今年早稻的产量超过去年晚稻的产量，立志打破“早四晚六”的陈规，他们提前半个月完成了春耕准备工作。全体社员在欢度春节假期后的第一天，立即掀起了开门红的春耕热潮，播下了争取今年大丰收的第一批种子。这样立大志，鼓干劲，争上游，抢时间的精神值得各人民公社效法。各地应当充分发动群众，立即把生产计划落实到队，把增产措施落实到田。有什么问题就解决什么问题；有什么困难就克服什么困难，一定要轰轰烈烈地而又踏踏实实地掀起一个备耕高潮，迎接春播。
