    The advanced collective Tianjin Guangfu Road Store, which attended the 1959 National Congress of Heroes, has done an excellent job in comprehensively organizing the people's economic life. Recently, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called on all enterprises and institutions in the province's finance and trade system to launch a mass movement to learn from and catch up with Guangfu Road, and to raise the province's finance and trade work to a new level.

    Guangfu Road Store is a retail store经营副食品和小百货的零售店that deals in non-staple foods and small commodities. It has 63 employees and is responsible for the supply of non-staple foods and small commodities to more than 10,000 employees and cadres in more than 80 nearby factories, enterprises, and institutions, and more than 20,000 residents. Not long ago, under the leadership of the Party committee, this store, in coordination with all parties, established a unified leadership organization, bringing together 101 units in 12 industries, including grain, catering, coal construction, services, department stores, and banks, to take on the task of comprehensively organizing the economic life of the city's people.

    Relying on the Masses to Rationally Allocate Commodities

    The Guangfu Road Store, relying on the support of the Party committees of factories and enterprises and street Party organizations, organized the "Stringing Hundred Doors" campaign. Salespersons divided up the work and went to factories and households to extensively solicit opinions from the masses, so that they understood the needs and opinions of factories, enterprises, institutions, organizations, schools, troops, hospitals, hotels, production service cooperatives, and residents; grasped the living conditions of various residents, such as employees' families, single employees, military dependents and families of martyrs, pregnant women, the elderly, the weak, the sick, the disabled, and the young; and were familiar with the number of households, population, residence, economic income, consumption level, living habits, tastes, purchasing patterns, and attitudes towards market changes of the residents. They learned that: workers and cadres, because they were busy with production and work, did not have time to buy things, and asked to have the goods delivered to their homes or to extend business hours; general residents asked for fair and reasonable commodity distribution; collective canteens asked for regular and quantitative supplies. Based on these requirements, they repeatedly studied and discussed, and repeatedly solicited opinions from the masses, and determined the principle of "guaranteeing key needs, taking care of necessities, and arranging for general needs," and agreed on reasonable commodity distribution ratios for five types of customers: factories and enterprises, non-governmental collective organizations, general residents, needy households, and transient populations.

    After determining reasonable commodity distribution ratios, they also rationally adjusted commodities according to people's economic conditions, living habits, and different tastes. Through street Party committees and activists among the residents, they carried out publicity and explanation work, promoted the spirit of mutual concession, and relied on resident groups to negotiate and adjust various commodities according to actual needs by the masses themselves. They relied on the information they learned from daily visits to plan and adjust people's lives according to the possibility of commodity supply. For example, exchanging special varieties needed by residents with the meals of organs and enterprise canteens; for fast-selling varieties that everyone needs, processing them into pre-prepared dishes to expand the sales area; for goods that residents need to sell, adopting a cyclical cross-supply; for commodities supplied quantitatively with vouchers, when residents found that some had too much and some had not enough, they mutually adjusted them under the principle of voluntary action through publicity and explanation; for collective canteens, under the premise of ensuring key needs, they naturally formed groups according to the dates when the canteens improved their lives, and supplied them in turn, etc. As a result, key units were guaranteed supply, special needs households received due care, and the lives of general residents were appropriately arranged.

    They put forward the slogan of "fast, accurate, good, and striving for every second for customers" to improve supply methods and facilitate the masses. The methods are: first, grasp sales patterns and improve technical level. According to the different purchasing patterns and moods of different customers every morning, noon, and evening, they adopted different supply methods. For example, in the morning, general employees are eager to purchase goods, so they broke down stall group boundaries, the whole store cooperated, and concentrated their efforts to focus on key points; in order to achieve fast, accurate, and good collection, accounting, and delivery of goods, they often carried out technical drills. At present, eight salespersons in the store have become service experts at the district level. The technical level of 26 salespersons has broken through the provincial technical performance record. Second, divide up areas and establish supply points. Supply stations were set up at every important intersection, and 26 mobile trucks were contracted to deliver goods to homes. Twenty-four resident consignment points and supply stations were also established, so that there were stores on streets, trucks in alleys, stations at intersections, and points in resident groups, crisscrossing and densely distributed, greatly facilitating the masses. Third, actively deliver goods to meet the needs of all parties. For the delivery of goods to production service cooperatives, they strive to arrive before the start of production; pre-distribute goods to canteens for direct allocation; for the living needs of the elderly, the weak, the sick, the disabled, and pregnant women, they are fully responsible for everything. The slogan of the salespersons is: "One person goes to deliver goods, a hundred households do not have to leave their homes." This spirit deeply moved the masses.

    Serving Workers' Lives is Serving Production

    The 1959 National Congress of Heroes put forward the call for commercial departments to further promote the high-speed development of production. However, how can retail stores promote production? Some employees said: "What we do is oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, we don't supply raw materials, nor do we sell products, there's no way to support production." At this time, the store's Party branch mobilized employees to go deep into the factories to understand the needs of production. Veteran employees Wang Guangsheng and Zhou Shiming went to the fourth workshop of Tianjin Steel Rolling Mill No. 3 and saw that the workers were very busy with production, but the "health dishes" made at night had few varieties and were not fresh, and the workers did not eat well. After they reported back to the leadership, the Party branch immediately discussed it and decided that the store director should lead the salespersons and invite chefs from Dongsheng Building to rush to the factory late at night to help arrange the menu and improve cooking methods, so that the workers could eat well and save money. This greatly encouraged the workers, who said: "We have the leadership of the Party in front, and the support of the store behind, there is no problem in completing the high-yield plan." As a result, the production of the A, B, and C shifts all exceeded the high-yield targets. The facts made the store employees further understand the relationship between life and production, and realized that serving the lives of workers is serving production, and operating oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar can also support production. Therefore, everyone loudly put forward the bold statement: "As long as production rises step by step, we are willing to break our backs for the workers."

    They relied on the factory Party branch and the workers to find out the production tasks, types of work, production situation, meal arrangements, and the workers' requirements and opinions on life, helped the factory canteen arrange the menu, improve cooking skills, and establish management systems; helped the cooks improve their service attitude, and helped the canteen make a savings plan, so that the work of the canteens of organs and enterprises had a great change, the varieties of staple and non-staple foods increased to one or two hundred, and boosted the production enthusiasm of the workers.

    In order to supply the workers with the daily necessities they needed, they also added sales departments in factories and workshops, built consignment points in workers' dormitories, and added night shift mobile sales trucks at night, so that there was supply where there was production, supply when needed, special personnel for supply during the day, special trucks for supply at night, service to the workshop, and delivery to the side.

    After helping the factory run the canteen well and solving the problem of daily commodity supply, several salespersons, including Zhang Shizhen, discovered in Tianhong Electric Appliance Factory that the workers' sewing, washing and other life problems still took a lot of time and required a solution. The store's Party branch, under the unified leadership of the street Party committee, mobilized the broad masses of residents to establish service groups around the factory, which completely took over the workers' lives. They also set up life agents in various factories, and the workers' sewing, washing, mending and other life problems were contacted by the agents and service stations, so that services were provided to the factory. For example, this year's New Year, the workers were engaged in a year-end competition and had no time to get their hair cut, so they contacted the nearby barbershop and asked them to send barbers to various factories to solve the workers' hair cutting problem.

    While serving the workers, the salespersons were also encouraged by the workers' production enthusiasm. The salespersons and workers fought together, and the spirit of diligently serving the workers encouraged the workers. Boiler factories, Tianhong Electric Appliance Factory and other factories successively launched competitions with the store salespersons, sending each other big-character posters, expressing determination, and submitting war reports. The salespersons took serving the workers' lives well as a condition, and learned from the workers' selfless labor enthusiasm. The workers took the realization of overproduction as a condition, and learned from the salespersons' diligent service spirit. Whenever a task was completed, they beat gongs and drums to send good news to celebrate the victory. This not only promoted production, but also drove the leap forward in the store's work.

    Helping Residents Run Canteens in a Big Way

    Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, more and more housewives have participated in street-run factories and production service cooperatives, and they are eager to be liberated from housework. Some women who have not participated in social labor also ask to get rid of housework and take up production positions. In response to these demands of the masses, the store went deep into the residential areas to visit and learned that to liberate housewives from housework, the first thing to solve is the problem of eating. Under the leadership of the street Party committee, they and the masses, in the spirit of everyone doing big things together and running canteens self-reliantly, the Party committee organized, the masses contributed people, and the store provided priority supply of cooking utensils. In this way, resident canteens developed quickly. At present, the number of people joining the canteen has reached more than 24,000, accounting for 55.7% of the total number of residents.

    In running canteens in a big way, they adhered to the principle of actively running them well and voluntarily participating, building one and consolidating one, building a batch and consolidating a batch. They paid attention to the characteristics of the area and the living habits of the masses, on the one hand, meeting the common needs of the majority of people, and on the other hand, considering the special needs of some people. Residents can join the whole meal, half meal, or holiday meal according to their needs; they can buy staple food alone, or non-staple food alone; they can eat in the canteen, or take it home to eat. In order to take care of special needs, the store helped the public canteen to attach a small shop, a maternity supply department, a canteen for the blind and disabled, an elderly and young people's canteen, and a mother and child restaurant. Residents reported that it is more free and convenient in the big collective, and the small pots and small stoves cannot compare. The store also helped to improve cooking skills, so that the variety of dishes is diverse, rich and colorful, and the food is good and economical. As a result, the original and newly built canteens have increased breakfast, and the variety of dishes is not repeated for a week or ten days. The average monthly food cost for general residents is six to eight yuan, and those with higher living standards or who eat more are only thirteen yuan. Most people can save one to two yuan per month compared with small pots and small stoves. The store also helped the canteen train cooks, inviting the best chefs to the non-governmental canteen for on-site guidance; inviting the better non-governmental canteen cooks to the state-run restaurants to practice on the stove, and the chefs personally guided them. A total of more than 200 chefs for large, medium and small stoves have been trained, basically meeting the needs of canteen development. They also combined with the financial department to help the newly established canteen establish a financial management system. Help the cooks establish a mass viewpoint; go to the kitchen and work with the cooks, make friends, and help the cooks improve their service attitude. In addition, some state-run restaurants that do not make money and only charge 10% management fees have been established to serve travelers and porters.

    Organizing Residents to Run Social Service Undertakings in a Big Way

    The Guangfu Road Store adopted the method of taking the store as the core, combining the operation of organs and enterprises with the self-operation of the masses. In addition to establishing a state-run service general station, which is responsible for handling some major, technical, and policy-oriented projects and playing a leading and exemplary role, it mainly mobilized the masses to do it themselves and serve themselves. They established six branches in the production service cooperative, set up 77 service groups in the residential area, and also set up more than 50 service boxes in the residential courtyard. The service personnel reached 360 people, forming a densely distributed service network from the general station to the branch station and the group.

    The service projects of the service station pay special attention to solving the most common and urgent life problems of the masses, such as disassembly and washing, sewing, opening hot water shops, repairing iron and aluminum utensils, food processing, hairdressing, showering, and beautifying the family. At the same time, it also pays attention to meeting the diverse life requirements of the masses, and vigorously undertakes other service projects, such as: asking doctors on behalf of others, opening medical stations, serving patients, decocting and taking medicine, midwifery and nursing, handling marriage and funeral affairs on behalf of others, handling savings and postal services on behalf of others, collecting water and electricity bills on behalf of others, writing letters on behalf of others, etc. Whatever the masses need, they do it, everything is available.

    The state-run service general station implements unified leadership, unified operation, and separate accounting for the non-governmental service branches. The service general station selects special personnel to help guide business, impart technology, help establish management systems, check the implementation of policies, and help solve problems that each branch station is unable to solve.

    In order to supplement the shortcomings of the service projects of the service station and service group, a "family mutual service" activity was also carried out among the residents, and the elderly and weak residents were organized to carry out mutual service with the residential courtyard as a unit. This service is mainly simple and minor labor, such as guarding the door, receiving letters, dumping dirty soil, and fetching hot water, which promotes a new atmosphere of mutual assistance, love, unity and harmony among neighbors.

    光复道商店树立城市商业为生产、生活服务的好榜样
    全面组织人民经济生活
    本报讯　出席1959年全国群英会的先进集体天津市光复道商店，全面组织人民经济生活，做得十分出色。最近，中共河北省委号召全省财贸系统企业单位掀起一个学光复道、赶光复道的群众运动，把全省财贸工作提高到一个新的水平。
    光复道商店是一个经营副食品和小百货的零售店，共有职工六十三人，负责对附近八十多个工厂、企业、机关一万多名职工、干部和两万多居民的副食品和小百货供应工作。不久前，这个商店在党委的领导下，协同各方，建立了一个统一的领导机构，把粮食、饮食、煤建、服务、百货、银行等十二个行业、一百零一个单位组织起来，担当起了全面组织城市人民经济生活的任务。
    依靠群众合理分配商品
    光复道商店依靠工厂、企业党委和街道党组织的支持，组织了“串百家门”活动。售货员们分片包干，下厂到户，广泛征求群众意见，作到了了解工厂、企业、机关、团体、学校、部队、医院、旅店、生产服务社、居民的要求和意见；掌握职工家属、单身职工、军属烈属、孕产妇、孤老病残弱幼等各种居民的生活情况；熟悉居民的户数、人口、住地、经济收入、消费水平、生活习惯、口味喜好、购买规律、对市场变化的态度等。他们了解到：工人、干部因为生产、工作繁忙，没有时间买东西，要求把商品送到家或延长营业时间；一般居民要求商品分配公平合理；集体食堂要求定期定量供应。根据这些要求，他们反复研究讨论，多次征询群众意见，确定了“保证重点，照顾必需，安排一般”的原则，对工厂企业、民办集体组织、一般居民、必需户、流动人口等五类顾客，议定了合理的商品分配比例。
    确定了合理的商品分配比例以后，他们还根据人们的经济条件，生活习惯，口味不同，合理地调剂商品。他们通过街道党委和居民中的积极分子，开展宣传解释工作，提倡互相谦让的精神，依靠居民小组，按照实际需要，由群众自己协商调剂各种商品。他们依靠平日访问了解的情况，按照商品供应的可能，有计划地调剂人民生活。例如把居民需要的特殊品种与机关企业伙食团对换；对大家都需要的快品种，就加工改成份菜，扩大售货面，对居民需要的销货，采取循环交叉供应；对凭证定量供应的商品，发现居民有的多余，有的不够的时候，通过宣传解释，在自愿的原则下，互相调剂；对集体食堂，在保证重点的前提下，按照食堂改善生活的日期，自然结组，轮流供应等。这样做的结果，重点单位得到了有保证的供应，特殊需要户得到了应有的照顾，一般居民的生活得到了适当安排。
    他们提出了“快、准、好，为顾客争取分秒”的口号来改进供应方法，便利群众。办法是：第一，掌握销货规律，提高技术水平。根据每天早、午、晚和不同顾客的不同购买规律和心情，采取不同的供应办法。例如，早晨一般职工购货心情急切，他们就打破摊组界限，全店大协作，集中力量突击重点；为了做到收款、算账、付货快、准、好，经常开展技术大练兵。目前全店已有八名售货员成为区一级服务能手。有二十六名售货员的技术水平突破了省技术表演纪录。第二，分片包干，普遍建立供应点。每个要路口上都设有供应站，二十六辆流动货车分片包干，送货上门。还建立了二十四处居民代销点、供应站，作到了街有商店，巷有货车，路口有站，居民组有点，纵横交错。星罗棋布，大大便利了群众。第三，主动送货，满足各方需要。对生产服务社送货，力争赶在生产开始以前；对食堂预先配货，直接调拨，对老、弱、病、残、孕产妇的生活需要，一包到底，全面负责。售货员们的口号是：“一人去送货，百家不出门”。这种精神使群众深受感动。
    为工人生活服务就是为生产服务
    1959年全国群英会向商业部门提出了进一步促进生产高速度发展的号召。但是，零售商店怎么促进生产呢？有的职工说：“咱们干的是油盐酱醋，既不供应原料，又不包销产品，支持生产没门”。这时商店党支部便发动职工深入到工厂中去，了解生产上的需要。老职工王广胜、周士明到天津轧钢三厂四车间去，看到工人们生产很紧张，可是夜间作的“保健菜”花样少，味不鲜，工人吃不好。他们回来向领导上汇报以后，党支部立即进行了讨论，决定由商店主任带领售货员并邀请东升楼厨师深夜赶到工厂，帮助安排菜单和改进烹调作法，让工人们吃好、吃省。这给了工人很大鼓舞，他们说：“前边有党的领导，后边有商店支援，完成高产计划没问题。”结果，甲、乙、丙三班的生产都超过了高产指标。事实使商店职工进一步弄清了生活和生产的关系，认识到为工人生活服务就是为生产服务，经营油、盐、酱、醋也能支持生产。于是，大家响亮地提出了“只要生产步步高，愿为工人折断腰”的豪言壮语。
    他们依靠工厂党支部和工人，摸清生产任务、工种工序、生产情况、伙食安排、职工对生活的要求和意见，帮助工厂食堂安排菜单，提高烹饪技术，建立管理制度；帮助炊事员改善服务态度，帮助食堂作好节约计划，使机关、企业食堂的工作有很大改变，主副食的品种增加到一、二百种，鼓舞了职工的生产热情。
    为了供应工人日常需要的商品，他们还在工厂、车间增设代销部，在职工宿舍增建代销点，夜间增加夜班流动售货车，做到了那里有生产，那里有供应，什么时候需要，就什么时候供应，白天供应有专人，夜间供应有专车，服务到车间，送货到身旁。
    帮助工厂办好食堂，又解决了日常商品供应问题以后，张士珍等几个售货员在天虹电器厂又发现工人的缝、洗等生活问题，还占很多时间，要求解决。商店党支部便在街党委的统一领导下，发动广大居民群众在工厂周围普遍成立了服务组，全部包下了工人的生活。他们还在各工厂设立了生活代办员，工人的缝洗、拆补等生活问题，由代办员和服务站联系，做到服务到厂。如今年新年，工人搞跨年竞赛，没时间理发，他们就和附近理发店联系，请他们派理发员到各厂，解决了工人理发的问题。
    售货员在为工人服务的同时，也受到了工人生产热情的鼓舞。售货员和工人一起奋战，勤勤恳恳的为工人服务的精神又鼓舞了工人。锅炉厂、天虹电器厂等工厂工人都先后同商店售货员开展了竞赛，互送大字报、表决心，递战表，售货员以为工人生活服务好为条件，向工人学习忘我的劳动热情，工人以实现超产为条件，学习售货员勤勤恳恳的服务精神。每逢一项任务完成之后，互相敲锣打鼓，送喜报庆贺胜利。这样既促进了生产，又带动了商店工作的跃进。
    帮助居民大办食堂
    从1958年大跃进以来，参加街道民办工厂和生产服务社的家庭妇女，越来越多，她们迫切要求从家务劳动中解放出来。有些未参加社会劳动的妇女，也要求摆脱家务劳动，走上生产岗位。商店针对群众这些要求，深入居民区访问，了解到要把家庭妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，首先要解决吃饭问题。在街道党委的领导下，他们和群众一起，本着大伙事大伙办，自力更生办食堂的精神，党委组织，群众出人，商店指导，炊事用具优先供应。这样，使居民食堂很快发展起来。目前加入食堂的人数已达到二万四千多人，占居民总人数的55．7％。
    在大办食堂中，他们坚持了积极办好，自愿参加的原则，建一个巩固一个，建立一批就巩固一批。注意地区特点和群众的生活习惯，一方面满足多数人的共同需要，又考虑到某些人的特殊需要。居民根据自己的需要，可以入整伙、半伙、假日入伙；可以单买主食，也可以单买副食；可以在食堂吃，也可以带回家吃。为了照顾特殊需要，商店帮助公共食堂附设了小卖部，产妇供应部，盲人、病残食堂，老幼食堂，母子餐厅。居民们反映在大集体里更自由、更方便，小锅小灶比不了。商店还帮助提高烹饪技术，使饭菜品种多种多样、丰富多彩，吃好、吃省。这样作的结果，原有和新建的食堂都增加了早点，饭菜花样一周一旬不重样。一般居民平均每月饭费六至八元，生活高一些的或吃的多一些的也不过十三元。多数人每月比小锅小灶时可节约一至二元。商店还帮助食堂培训炊事员，把最优秀的厨师请到民办食堂，就灶指导；把较好的民办食堂炊事员请到国营饮食店上灶实习，由厨师亲自指导。总共培训了二百多名大、中、小灶厨师，基本上满足了食堂发展的需要。他们又结合财政部门，帮助新办食堂建立财务管理制度。帮助炊事员树立群众观点；到厨房和炊事员共同劳动，交朋友，帮助炊事员改善服务态度。此外，还建立了一些国营的不赚钱、只收10％管理费的饮食店，为旅客、搬运工人服务。
    组织居民大办社会服务事业
    光复道商店采取了以商店为核心，机关企业办和群众自办相结合的办法，除建立起国营服务总站，负责办一些主要的、技术性、政策性强的项目，起带头示范作用外，主要是发动群众，自己动手，自我服务。他们在生产服务社里建立了六个分站，在居民区里设了七十七个服务小组，还在居民大院里设立了五十多个服务箱，服务人员共达三百六十人，从总站到分站、小组形成了一个星罗棋布的服务网。
    服务站的服务项目，特别注意解决群众生活中最普遍、最迫切的生活问题，像拆洗、缝纫、开办热水铺、铁铝器修理、食品加工、理发、淋浴、美化家庭等。同时也注意满足群众多种多样的生活要求，大力承揽其它服务项目，比如：代请医生，开办医疗站、侍候病人、煎汤拿药、接生护理，代办婚、丧事务，代办储蓄、邮电，代收水电费，代写书信等，群众需要什么，就办什么，应有尽有。
    国营服务总站对民办服务分站实行统一领导，统一经营，分别核算。服务总站选派专人帮助指导业务，传授技术，帮助建立管理制度，检查政策执行情况，帮助解决各分站无力解决的问题。
    为了补充服务站、服务小组服务项目的不足，还在居民中开展了“家庭互相服务”活动，以居民院为单位，组织老弱居民开展互相服务。这种服务主要是简单和轻微劳动，如看门、收信、倒脏土、打热水等，促使邻里之间出现了互助友爱、团结和睦的新风气。
