    The Great Wall of the East Sea
    By Our Correspondent Yi Xintian
    Near the Feiyun River estuary on the border of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, a brand-new hundred-li dike has recently appeared. This is the "Great Wall of the East Sea," famous throughout Zhejiang province for its ability to withstand strong typhoons and sea waves. It was recently built by the people of Ruian County in southern Zhejiang.
    Making the Great Tide and Huge Waves Bow Their Heads
    For the hundreds of thousands of residents in the coastal areas here, this seawall is of utmost importance! In the long years past, the lack of a solid seawall meant that the people here suffered countless disasters from storms and huge waves, generation after generation. The elderly clearly remember that before liberation, this seawall, which had been in disrepair for many years, would cause houses to collapse and farmland to be submerged, resulting in no harvest. Hundreds of thousands of acres of fields were flooded, resulting in no harvest; tens of thousands of people were swept into the sea and buried in the bellies of fish. According to the Ruian County Annals, there were several occasions when ten thousand corpses floated in the sea; even more people left their homes and fled to escape famine.
    After liberation, every winter and spring, red flags were planted all over the seawall, indicating the peasants who were organized by the Party to repair the dike. Because the original seawall foundation was too poor and the dike body was narrow, there was still a risk of breaches and collapses when strong typhoons and huge waves hit. Therefore, every time the typhoon season came, a comprehensive inspection and repair was carried out, and when a typhoon came, thousands upon thousands of people had to go to the dike day and night to guard against dangers and carry out emergency repairs, spending about two hundred thousand labors on this every year. In the autumn of 1959, just as the coastal people were immersed in the joy of a bumper harvest, the Ruian County Party Committee, according to the demands of the masses, decided to rely on the great superiority of the people's commune, to take fundamental measures to build the current hundred-li dike. This good news spread like wings throughout the county, and everyone told each other, and everyone was overjoyed. The four communes in the coastal area immediately transferred more than 30,000 commune members to form a dike-building army, bringing bedding, tools, and equipment, and set off for the East China Sea coast.
    As waves of cold air continued to move south, the battle to build the hundred-li dike began. The heroes roared, "We will make typhoons bow their heads forever, and we will make the great tide give way forever." Listen to the common battle cry of the hundred-plus Zhao Zilong groups composed of young commune members: "Everyone's drive is better than Wu Song's, I am more heroic than Wu Song, Wu Song only fought one tiger, we can capture the dragons of the four seas." In just over two months, the hundred-li dike was basically completed. This is a huge seawall, the top of the dike is wide enough for two cars to drive side by side, the bottom of the dike is about twelve zhang wide, and the total earthwork for building the dike is two and a half million cubic meters. This Great Wall of the East Sea is truly like a copper wall and iron wall, no matter how fierce the storms and waves come, they can only obediently return to the East Sea.
    Many commune members wrote poems and songs, praising the people's commune for building the hundred-li dike to benefit future generations. One poem says: The commune builds the dike so majestic, its heroic posture is unprecedented; as strong as a copper wall, a hundred li long, locking the iron gate for ten thousand years; the Great Wall powerfully suppresses the East Sea Dragon, the great lakes and huge waves bow their heads in submission; a hundred li of barren soil becomes good farmland, and future generations enjoy happiness.
    Lin Shunyou
    When I met Lin Shunyou, the deputy secretary of the Party General Branch of the Xueli Brigade of the Xin'cheng Commune, at the construction site, his bare feet were covered with mud, his trouser legs were rolled up high, and his waist was tightly tied with a cloth belt. Although he was over forty years old, he was full of energy. In this area of the construction site, people often saw him running around. If the progress of any section was slow, he would go to that section to participate in the labor and check the progress and quality of the project. At night, or during rest periods, groups of people would surround Lin Shunyou, listening to him tell the tragic stories of the seawall breaches before liberation.
    Lin Shunyou grew up on the coast. He saw and heard a lot about the disasters brought by typhoons and tides. When he was a child, he heard his grandfather say that when the seawall breached and the fields were washed away, there was no harvest for three years, and even tree bark and grass roots were eaten up. In the autumn of a year before liberation, he was working by the sea when the flood tide washed away the seawall, and he was almost swept into the sea by the angry tide. After liberation, Lin Shunyou saw that the Party was very concerned about the repair of the seawall, and the state provided loans and allocated equipment, and Lin Shunyou was moved to tears. Every time he repaired the dike and fought against typhoons, he always stood on the front line, often staying up all night.
    Lin Shunyou led more than a thousand commune members to build the dike, as if he were much younger. Every day, before the sea could be seen, he had already run around the work shed. He went to every kitchen to see if the cooks were cooking, and often it was he who woke up the cooks to cook. At the construction site, commune members had often just finished breakfast when Lin Shunyou had already started working. One day, it was drizzling, and the commune members of the Xueli Production Team had breakfast and started work earlier than other teams, but when they arrived at the construction site, they found someone even earlier was loading and transporting mud. "Who is working so early?" Everyone walked closer with questions, "Oh! Secretary Lin, you're early again!" Lin Shunyou just smiled. In fact, before coming here, he had already worked in another team for a while.
    Lin Shunyou is the commander of more than a thousand workers, a combatant participating in the dike construction, and also an excellent propagandist. Every day, whether he went to work or to eat, he always carried a megaphone in his hand on the road, broadcasting to the commune members all the way, which group had high work efficiency, which team had good cooperation, and who had great enthusiasm, he compiled them into clappers, lotus falls, and mountain songs, speaking and singing by himself. When the weather was fine, he encouraged everyone to work harder. When it rained, he encouraged everyone to overcome difficulties and persist in working. When the commune members heard Lin Shunyou's voice, their enthusiasm was even greater. "Wherever Secretary Lin goes, there is laughter, and wherever he goes, there is more hard work." This is the evaluation given to him by the commune members.
    With such a good leader as Lin Shunyou, why worry that the dike will not be built soon?
    Fighting the Sea Tide
    The deeds of five Communist Party members blocking the breach with their bodies and fighting the flood tide are widely circulated on the seawall construction site.
    That was the day before the dike started construction. More than 800 commune members from the Ziao Brigade of the Tangxia Commune built a more than 300-meter-long tide barrier on the beach to block the tide water so that they could start building the dike. As soon as the tide barrier was built, it encountered the third day of the eleventh lunar month, a great tide. On this day, strong winds and heavy rains continued, and the tide rose higher and higher, with huge waves slamming against the tide barrier. Early in the morning, the commune members went to the seaside and saw that five breaches had been washed away in the tide barrier, and the tide was rushing into the dam, threatening to destroy the tide barrier. At this time, Communist Party members Dong Cunqi and Cai Mingliu walked out of the crowd, ran into the sea, and braved the wind, rain, and cold to block the breach with their bodies. Angry tides pounded them in waves, and huge waves kept hitting them over the head. They stretched out their arms and used their strength to hold their bodies. If the tide barrier collapsed, it would be difficult to start construction of the dike, it would take more than 8,000 more labors, and the completion time would be delayed. Could they let it be washed away? No, absolutely not. While enduring the cold, they tried their best to support themselves and shouted loudly for everyone to come and rescue. After a while, three more people went into the sea. They were Communist Party members Huang Baorong, Zheng Sanfangmu, and Shao Qiandi. They also used their bodies to block the breach. When the young woman Shao Qiandi walked into the water that was deeper than her abdomen, it was difficult to pull her feet out, but she still moved forward step by step. A fierce wave knocked her down, she immediately got up, wiped the mud off her face, and finally went to the tide barrier to block the breach. Then, more than seventy commune members came to the rescue one after another. People ran on the beach to move mud and grass, and rushed to build the dam. At this time, the wind was strong and the rain was heavy, and the tide took advantage of the wind, and the wind helped the waves. The commune members' clothes were soaked, they were covered in mud, and it was cold; however, the weather was cold but their hearts were warm, and the stronger the wind and the bigger the waves, the greater their enthusiasm. They persisted in fighting the sea tide in the sea for more than three hours. The tide barrier was repaired, the tide retreated obediently, and the commune members showed a victorious smile.
    Mulan Group
    There are more than one hundred "Mulan" shock brigades composed of young female commune members. They compete with the "Zhao Zilong" group, and many "Mulan" have surpassed the "Zhao Zilong" and won the award flag.
    The "Jiuli Mulan" group is composed of more than a dozen young female commune members from the Jiuli Production Team of the Xinzhen Commune. This group was famous throughout Zhejiang province last autumn for its fine harvesting. This time, in the construction of the seawall, they were ranked first in the county for their high work efficiency, fast progress, and good quality. The second sister, Pan Duomei, knows how to knock soil, transport soil, and pile soil. People say that she is truly "heroic and high-spirited" when she transports soil. The beach is full of mud up to the thighs, making it very difficult to transport mud, but Pan Duomei said, "It is not called Mulan if you are not afraid of difficulties." She experimented with using a skateboard to transport mud, which doubled her work efficiency and was rewarded three times. She joined the Communist Party of China at the construction site. The ninth sister, Pan Chunying, is the youngest girl in the group. Before building the dike, she had never left her mother. This time, she resolutely asked to participate in the dike construction. She never lagged behind at the construction site, and people praised her as a truly "capable little Mulan." She joined the Communist Youth League at the construction site.
    On this magnificent seawall, the commune cadres described a beautiful picture to me: buses and transport vehicles will be running on the hundred-li dike; ships and boats will be coming and going in the "Commune River" (the place where the dike was built and the soil was dug is built into a river); inside the dike is a garden full of crops, and tractors are running around; fish fry are raised in the river, and countless flocks of ducks are playing; peach and willow trees are planted along the dike and river bank, the trees are shaded, the flowers are blooming, and the hundred fruits are drooping; the dike slope and river wall are full of green grass fodder, and there are thousands of cattle farms and ten thousand pig farms everywhere along the dike and river.

    东海长城
    本报记者　伊心恬
    靠近浙闽边境的飞云江口海岸，最近出现了一条崭新的百里大堤，这就是闻名浙江全省能阻挡强大台风和海浪的“东海长城”。这是浙南瑞安县人民新近修建起来的。
    让大潮巨浪低头
    对于这里沿海地区几十万居民来说，这条海堤是显得多么重要啊！在过去漫长的年月里，就是因为缺少一条坚固的海堤，这里的人民祖祖辈辈不知遭受过多少暴风巨浪的灾难。老年人清楚地记得，解放前，这条年久失修的海堤，碰到台风洪潮，房屋顿时东倒西塌，往往几十万亩田园被淹没，颗粒无收；成千上万的人被卷入海中，葬身鱼腹。据瑞安县志记载，海中漂尸万具就有好几次；更多的人离乡背井，外出逃荒。
    解放后每年冬春，海堤遍插红旗，那是党领导组织起来的农民在培修堤身。由于原来的海堤基础太差，堤身又狭，碰到强大台风和巨浪，还有决口倒塌的危险。因此，每到台风发生的季节，又要全面检查培修，台风一来，更要千千万万的人不分昼夜地上堤守护抢险，一年花在这方面的劳力大约有二十多万个。1959年秋后，正是沿海人民浸沉在大丰收喜悦中的时候，中共瑞安县委根据群众的要求，决定依靠人民公社的巨大优越性，采取根本性的治理措施，修筑目前这条百里大堤。这个喜讯像长了翅膀一样，迅速传遍了全县各地，人人奔走相告，个个欢欣鼓舞。沿海地区四个公社立即抽调了三万多社员，组成筑堤大军，带了铺盖、工具、器材，开赴东海海滨。
    当一股股寒流不断南下的时候，修筑百里大堤的战斗开始了。英雄们发出了吼声：“要叫台风永远低头，要叫大潮永远让路”。请听一下青年社员组成的一百多个赵子龙小组共同的战斗口号吧：“人人干劲比武松，我比武松更英雄，武松只打一只虎，我们能擒四海龙”。短短的两个多月，百里大堤就基本上修筑完成了。这是一条规模巨大的海堤，堤面足可并行两辆汽车，堤底宽约十二丈，筑堤的土方共达两百五十万方。这条东海长城真像铜墙铁壁一样，惊涛骇浪，来势再凶，也只好驯服地退回东海。
    许多社员写诗作歌，赞美人民公社修筑百里大堤造福万代。有一首诗说：公社造堤多巍峨，雄姿威武自古无；坚如铜墙长百里，锁紧铁门万年固；长城威镇东海龙，大湖巨浪低头服；百里薄土成良田，子孙万代享幸福。
    林顺友
    我在工地上会见莘塍公社薛里大队党总支副书记林顺友的时候，他赤着的双脚，沾满污泥，裤脚卷得高高的，腰间紧束着布带。他虽然四十开外的年纪了，精力却很充沛。在这一带工地上，人们经常看到他东奔西走，哪一段进度慢，他就到哪一段去参加劳动，检查工程进度和质量。晚上，或者休息时间，一堆堆人围着林顺友，听他讲述解放前海堤决口的悲惨故事。
    林顺友从小在海滨长大，对于台风大潮带来的灾难，他看得多也听得多。还是儿童的时代，他就听祖父说，海堤决口田地冲坏，三年没收，树皮草根都吃光。解放前的一年秋天，他正在海边劳动，洪潮把海堤冲垮了，他险些被怒潮卷入大海。解放后，林顺友看到党十分关心培修海堤工作，国家贷款又调拨器材，林顺友感动得流下泪来。每次修堤和抗台斗争，他总是站在最前线，常常彻夜不眠。
    林顺友带领一千多名社员修筑大堤，好像年轻得多了。每天，海上还看不到鱼肚白，他已经去工棚跑一圈了。他跑到每一个灶间去看炊事员烧饭没有，往往都是他去推醒炊事员起来烧饭。在工地上，常常是社员们刚吃早饭，林顺友已经出工了。有一天，细雨蒙蒙，薛里生产队的社员们吃过早饭，比别的队早出工，可是一到工地，发现一个更早的人在装运泥土了。“是谁这样早上工？”大家带着疑问走近一看，“哦！林书记，又是你早啦！”林顺友只是笑了笑，其实，他来这里以前，已在别的队劳动一会了。
    林顺友是一千多民工的指挥员，是参加筑堤的战斗员，同时又是出色的宣传员。每天，他不论去上工，还是去吃饭，走在路上，他手里总是拿着广播筒，一路上边走边向社员们广播，哪个组工效高，哪个队协作好，哪个人干劲大，他都编成了快板、莲花落、山歌，自说自唱。天晴他鼓动大家加油干，天雨他又鼓励大家要克服困难，坚持出工。社员们一听到林顺友的声音，干劲更大了。“林书记到哪里，哪里就是笑声，哪里就加油干”，这是社员们给他的评价。
    有了林顺友这样的好领导，又何愁大堤早日建不成呢？
    和海潮搏斗
    五个共产党员以身堵缺口和洪潮搏斗的事迹，在修筑海堤工地上广泛传颂着。
    那是大堤动工的前一天，塘下公社梓岙大队的八百多名社员，在海滩上筑成了一条三百多米长的挡潮坝，以便挡住大潮水，好动工筑堤。挡潮坝刚筑成，就碰到了阴历十一月初三大潮。这一天，狂风暴雨接连不停，潮水越涨越大，巨浪猛击着挡潮坝。清早，社员们到海边一看，挡潮坝已被冲坍五个缺口，潮水挤着向坝里急冲，眼看挡潮坝有被冲毁的危险。这时，只见人群中走出了共产党员董存其、蔡明柳，他们奔下海去，冒着风雨寒冷，用身体堵住缺口。怒潮一阵阵向他们猛扑着，巨浪不断地从头顶冲击过，他们伸开两臂，用劲掌住身体。挡潮坝冲垮了，大堤动工就有困难，要多花八千多个工，还要推迟完工时间。能让它冲掉吗？不能，决不能。他们一面忍受着寒冷侵袭，用力支持下去，一面大声叫喊大家前来抢救。不一会，又有三个人下海了，那是共产党员黄宝荣、郑三房姆和邵千弟。他们也用自己的身体堵住缺口。青年妇女邵千弟走到水深过腹时，脚难拔起，可是她还是一步步向前。一个凶猛的浪头把她冲倒了，她立刻爬起来，擦了擦脸上的污泥，终于到挡潮坝前堵缺口了。接着，先后有七十多个社员赶来抢险。人们奔跑在海滩上搬泥拿草，突击筑坝。这时风大雨大，潮乘风势，风助浪威，一个个社员衣服湿透了，满身是泥，寒冷刺骨；可是，天冷心热，风大浪大干劲更大。他们在海中坚持和海潮搏斗了三个多小时。挡潮坝抢修好了，潮水驯服地退下去了，社员们露出了胜利的微笑。
    花木兰小组
    由青年女社员组成的“花木兰”突击队共有一百多个。她们和“赵子龙”小组对口挂钩竞赛，许多“花木兰”胜过了“赵子龙”，夺得了奖旗。
    “九里花木兰”小组是莘塍公社九里生产队的十多个青年女社员组成的。这个小组去年秋收中，曾经以细收细打搞得好而闻名浙江全省。这次在修筑海堤中，她们又以工效高、进度快、质量好，名列全县第一。二姊潘多妹，敲土、运土、堆土样样会，人们说她运起土来真是“雄赳赳、气昂昂”。海滩烂泥深到大腿，运泥十分困难，潘多妹却说：“不怕困难才叫花木兰。”她试验使用滑板运泥，工效成倍提高，先后三次受到奖励。她在工地上加入了中国共产党。九妹潘春英是小组中最年轻的姑娘。在修堤前她从来没有离开过母亲。这次她坚决要求参加修堤。她在工地上从不落后，人们都夸奖她真是“能干的小花木兰”。她在工地上加入了共青团。
    在这座宏伟的海堤上，公社的干部们向我描绘了一幅美丽的图景：百里大堤上将奔驰着公共汽车、运输车；“公社河”（筑堤挖土的地方修成了一条河流）中来往驶着轮船航船；堤内一片满种作物的田园，拖拉机四处奔跑；河里放养鱼苗，无数的群鸭在嬉游；堤旁河岸桃柳夹种，林木成荫，鲜花怒放，百果垂枝；堤坡河壁满长青草饲料，沿堤沿河到处是千牛场、万猪场。
