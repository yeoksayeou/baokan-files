Great Leap Forward in Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Production
中共河口公社党委书记　丘金明 (Qiu Jinming, Secretary of the CCP Hekou Commune Party Committee)

Our Hekou People's Commune, like other parts of the country, achieved great developments in all aspects of production in 1959. In that year, the number of pigs in our commune increased by more than 40%, reaching over 11,000; cattle increased by 14%, reaching over 12,000; and sheep increased by 50%, reaching over 14,000. We were known as the "Ten Thousand Pigs, Ten Thousand Cattle, Ten Thousand Sheep" Commune. Similarly, grain production also saw great development, with total output increasing by 62%, from more than 24 million jin to more than 39 million jin. The Great Leap Forward in agricultural and animal husbandry production has made our commune stronger and the collective life of the commune members more prosperous. Last year, we not only paid wages to the commune members on time but also invested more than 80,000 yuan in capital construction; today, the commune has more than 300,000 yuan in savings. More than 90% of the commune members have savings. Last year, in addition to completing the public grain task, our commune retained enough grain for rations, feed, and seeds, and also kept 6.14 million jin of reserve grain, enough for all commune members to eat for more than eight months. Today, our commune is truly like the mountain song sung by the commune members: "There's manure in the fields, oil in the vegetables; heavy work has vehicles, plowing has cattle; grain in storage, savings in the bank, people strong and horses stout."

From this change, we deeply realized that by listening to Chairman Mao's words and firmly grasping animal husbandry, we could drive the great development of agricultural production, enabling a comprehensive leap forward in both grain and livestock production. However, in our actual work of implementing the Party's policy of giving equal importance to grain and livestock, we went through a long and tortuous process. Our area used to be a well-known poor place. The mountains had little soil and many stones. Before liberation, even in good weather, a mu of land could only yield 70 or 80 jin of grain. Often, by the time of the Spring Festival, most poor and landless peasants had nothing to cook. Young men of 17 or 18 could not even afford a pair of pants. The conditions in the dam area were slightly better, with a yield of only about 100 jin per mu, and life was not much better than in the mountains. Although grain production increased year by year after liberation, it had not been fundamentally resolved. Therefore, solving the grain problem as soon as possible was the most urgent wish of the vast number of peasants and cadres. All the cadres in our commune swore an oath: to work hard for several years to fundamentally solve the grain problem. No difficulty could suppress this determination! By 1958, the total grain output of the entire commune had increased from more than 9 million jin in 1952 to more than 24 million jin, an increase of more than one and a half times. At the beginning of last year, we summarized the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and analyzed the reasons for the increased production in each management area. In this summary, we discovered an important law that we had not recognized in the past: the places with the largest increase in grain production were also the places with the most livestock; conversely, the places with the lowest grain production were also the places with the fewest livestock. This was true for all thirty-plus management areas in the commune. For example, the Xiaochong and Liu Mahe management areas had an average of two pigs and two cattle per person, and the grain yield per mu in 1958 reached more than 800 jin. The Baishiyan management area was the area with the worst natural conditions in the entire commune, with an elevation of more than 2,400 meters, poor soil quality, and a thin soil layer. However, this management area had an average of two head of livestock per mu, and grain production increased from 490 jin per mu in 1958 to 645 jin; while the Luchong management area was only 1,800 meters above sea level, with a climate similar to that of Kunming, where it is like spring all year round, and the soil quality was much better than that of Baishiyan, but there was only an average of about 0.3 head of livestock (large and small) per mu. The grain yield per mu only increased from more than 200 jin to about 300 jin. This summary greatly enlightened us and opened our eyes. In the past, the leadership had repeatedly pointed out the dialectical relationship between animal husbandry and agricultural production, but because we lacked practical experience, we did not deeply understand these instructions from the Party. This time, we truly realized that the past idea of grasping grain in isolation, regardless of animal husbandry, was one-sided. We began to be determined to vigorously develop animal husbandry.

Once our thinking was correct, the question was how to turn this thinking into practical action by the masses. The Party committee believed that the most important thing was to make all cadres and masses understand the relationship of mutual dependence and promotion between agriculture and animal husbandry. Thus, a publicity campaign of comparing accounts and talking about the relationship between agriculture and animal husbandry was launched throughout the commune. The commune held many cadre meetings, Party member meetings, commune member meetings, and on-site meetings, speaking extensively about the benefits of developing animal husbandry. This quickly became known to every household. Many vivid typical examples enlightened and educated the cadres and masses. The commune members said, "Livestock is treasure all over. Selling them can support the country, slaughtering them can provide meat, harnessing them can work for the commune, and feeding them can accumulate manure and produce fertilizer." After the mass movement to develop animal husbandry was launched, we further realized that giving equal importance to grain and livestock was not only the correct policy of the Party but also the urgent demand of the vast masses. After the masses acted, many problems that were previously considered unsolvable were solved in the movement. For example, in the past, many cadres believed that pigs, cattle, and sheep were all "mouths to feed," and there would be nothing to feed them if there were too many. But the masses said, "Pigs eat a hundred kinds of grass, it depends on whether you can find them." The Xiaochong, Liu Mahe, and other management areas launched activities to collect wild feed, and found more than 100 kinds, solving more than 60% of the feed required. The Baishiya Management Area organized 70% of the labor force to go up the mountains to cut grass and prepared enough feed for five months in just over a month. Some Miao commune members fed fat pigs with wild feed that were even fatter than those fed with grain. Some cadres worried that if there were too many livestock, they would not be well protected in winter and would freeze to death. However, in many management areas, the masses went all out to participate in the work of protecting livestock through the winter on snowy and rainy days. People set up bonfires next to the livestock sheds, boiled hot water for the livestock, fed them salt, and some even took their own raincoats and straw mats to cover the livestock. As a result, not only did no livestock freeze to death last winter, but most of the livestock reached first-class or second-class condition.

Correctly implementing the Party's policies and constantly consolidating and promoting the enthusiasm of the masses is also the key to promoting the great development of animal husbandry. On the basis of the high enthusiasm of the masses, we also implemented a system of contracting and rewarding for feeding and managing livestock. The reproduction rate, service life, and condition of the livestock were contracted to the feeding and grazing personnel, and a system of rewarding overproduction was implemented, greatly stimulating the enthusiasm of the masses to manage the livestock well. After the Baishiya Management Area implemented the contracting and rewarding system, all seventy-six third-class yellow cattle basically reached full condition within one month. Within one month of implementing the general contracting system, the number of first-class large livestock in the Yinghe Management Area also increased from five to twenty-eight. Due to the strengthening of the sense of responsibility of the feeding and grazing personnel, a new atmosphere of loving livestock quickly formed throughout the commune. As the saying goes, "It is common to see horses being fed at night, but unheard of to see cattle being fed at night." However, most of the cattle and sheep in our commune were fed at night throughout the year last year. All livestock sheds were repaired to ensure warmth, dryness, and hygiene. Commune members also created methods such as grazing in small groups and feeding in small sheds to avoid livestock fighting and young livestock being trampled and squeezed. In the case of a small number of improved breeds, commune members also proposed to make full use of ordinary livestock for breeding. They said, "If the breed is not good, it is still good to slaughter it for meat and fertilizer." By November last year, the mating of all eligible breeding female livestock reached more than 90%.

The Great Leap Forward in animal husbandry in 1959 made us truly realize that as long as every cadre and member of the masses understands the benefits of developing animal husbandry, adheres to launching mass movements on a large scale, and gives full play to the enthusiasm and wisdom of the masses, advanced indicators and advanced measures can certainly be realized, and animal husbandry will certainly achieve great development. And the development of animal husbandry will bring us endless benefits.

    农牧业生产大跃进
    中共河口公社党委书记　丘金明
    我们河口人民公社在1959年像全国各地一样，各项生产都得到了很大的发展。这一年，我们公社的生猪增加了40％以上，达到了一万一千多头；牛增加了14％，达到了一万二千多头；羊增加了50％，达到了一万四千多头。被称为“万猪、万牛、万羊”公社。同样，粮食生产也有了很大发展，总产量增加了62％，由二千四百多万斤增加到三千九百多万斤。农、牧业生产的大跃进，使我们公社的腰杆子更硬、社员的集体生活也更加富裕了。去年，我们不但按期给社员发了工资，而且还投资八万多元进行了基本建设；如今，公社还有存款三十多万元。社员有存款的，也占总户数的90％以上。公社去年除完成了公粮任务外，留足了口粮、饲料、籽种以外，还留下了六百一十四万斤储备粮，够全体社员吃八个多月。今天我们的公社，真像社员们唱的山歌那样：“地里有粪，菜里有油；重活有车，犁田有牛；储粮存款，人强马壮。”
    从这个变化中，使我们深刻的体会到，听了毛主席的话，狠狠抓住畜牧业，就带动了农业生产的大发展，使粮畜生产都有了全面跃进。但在实际工作中贯彻党的粮畜并举的方针，我们曾经历了一个长期的、曲折的过程。我们这一带，过去是远近有名的穷地方。山区土少石头多，解放前，风调雨顺，一亩地也只收得七、八十斤粮食，往往到过年的时候，大多数贫雇农家里都揭不开锅了。十七、八岁的小伙子还穿不上一条裤子，坝区条件好一些，一亩也只收百把斤，生活也不比山区好多少，解放后粮食产量虽然年年都有增加，但还没有基本解决。因此，尽快地解决粮食问题，就是广大农民和干部最迫切的愿望。我们全公社的干部都发了誓：决心要苦战几年根本解决粮食问题。任何困难，都压不倒这个决心！到1958年，全社粮食总产量就由1952年的九百多万斤增加到二千四百多万斤，增加一倍半以上。我们在去年年初总结了1958年大跃进的经验，逐个分析了每个管理区增产多少的原因。在这次总结中，我们发现了一个过去所没有认识到的重要规律：凡是粮食增产最大的地方，都是牲畜最多的地方；相反，凡是粮食产量最低的，也是牲畜最少的地方。全社三十多个管理区无一例外。例如：小冲、六马河两个管理区平均每人两头猪，每户两头牛，1958年粮食单产就达到了八百多斤。白石岩管理区是全公社自然条件最坏的地方，那里拔海二千四百多米，土质又瘦，土层又薄，但是，这个管理区平均每亩地有两头牲畜，1958年粮食产量由每亩四百九十斤增长到六百四十五斤；而鲁冲管理区拔海只有一千八百米，气候同四季如春的昆明相似，土质也比白石岩好得多，但平均每亩才有大小牲畜零点三头左右。每亩粮食产量只由二百多斤提高到三百斤左右。这次总结，使我们受到了很大启发，眼睛豁然开朗。过去，领导上也曾经多次指出畜牧业和农业生产相互促进的辩证关系，但由于我们缺乏实际的体会，领会党的这些指示不深。这一次才真正认识到过去孤立地单抓粮食，不管畜牧业的思想是片面的。开始下定决心大抓畜牧业。
    思想对头了，问题是怎样把这个思想变为群众的实际行动。党委认为：最重要的，是让所有的干部和群众都懂得农牧业相互依赖相互促进的关系。于是，一个通过对比算账大讲农业与畜牧业关系的宣传活动，便在全公社展开了。公社一连召开了许多干部会、党员大会、社员大会和现场会议，大讲特讲发展畜牧业的好处。很快做到了家喻户晓，许多生动的典型事例启发教育了干部和群众，社员们说：“牲畜全身是宝，卖了可以支援国家，杀了可以吃肉，套上可以给公社干活，喂着可以攒粪产肥”。当发展畜牧业的群众运动起来之后，我们又进一步体会到：粮畜并举不但是党的正确方针，而且也是广大群众的迫切要求。群众行动起来以后，许多过去认为解决不了的问题，在运动中都迎刃而解。例如，以前有不少干部认为，猪牛羊都是“张嘴货”，养多了没有东西喂。可是群众却说：“猪吃百样草，看你找不找”，小冲、六马河等管理区开展了采集野生饲料的活动，先后找到了一百多种，解决了所需饲料总数的60％以上。白石崖管理区组织70％的劳动力上山割草，一个多月就备足了五个月的饲料。一些苗族社员用野生饲料喂的肥猪，比用粮食喂得还肥。有的干部怕牲畜多了冬天保护不好会冻死。可是，许多管理区在下雪下雨的日子里，群众都全力以赴参加了保护牲畜过冬的工作，人们在畜厩旁架起篝火，给牲畜烧热水、喂盐巴，有的还把自己的蓑衣和草垫拿给牲畜盖，结果，去年冬天不仅没冻死牲畜，而且大部分牲畜都达到了一等膘或二等膘。
    正确地贯彻执行党的政策，不断地巩固和发扬群众积极性，也是促进畜牧业大发展的关键。在群众热情高涨的基础上，我们又实行了饲养管理包干和奖励制度。将牲畜的繁殖率、使用年限、膘力等包给饲养放牧人员，实行超产奖励制度，大大激发了群众管好牲畜的积极性。白石崖管理区在实行包干奖励制度后，七十六头三类膘黄牛，在一个月内就全部基本上达到了满膘。营和管理区在实行了大包干的一个月内，一类膘的大牲畜也由五头增加到二十八头。由于加强了饲养放牧人员的责任心，一个热爱牲畜的新风气很快就在全公社形成了。常言说：“马喂夜草时常见，牛喂夜草不听说。”可是，我们公社的绝大部分牛、羊，去年全年都喂夜草。所有的畜厩全部都进行了修理，做到保暖、干燥、卫生。社员们还创造了小群放牧、小厩饲养等办法，避免牲畜打架和幼畜被踏被挤的现象。在良种不多的情况下，社员又提出尽量利用普通牲畜配种，他们说：“品种不好，生下来宰肉、造肥也是好的。”到去年11月份，全部大小适龄母畜配种达到了90％以上。
    1959年的畜牧业大跃进，使我们真正认识到，只要让干部和群众人人懂得发展畜牧业的好处，坚持大搞群众运动，发挥群众的干劲和智慧，先进指标和先进措施就一定能够实现，畜牧业就一定能够得到大发展。而畜牧业的发展，会给我们带来说不尽的好处。
