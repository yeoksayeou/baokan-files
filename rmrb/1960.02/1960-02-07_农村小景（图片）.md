    Rural Scene
    Mother holding her child looks at the installed light, joy in her brow, smile in her heart;
    What if the child cries tonight? Flick the switch to see the stars.
    Since the hydropower station was built, thousands of acres of fertile land no longer fear drought;
    Driving machines to engage in production, milling rice and grinding flour are no longer difficult;
    Heavy labor greatly reduced, men, women, old and young are happy;
    Agriculture and sideline occupations develop together, the rural landscape undergoes great changes.

    农村小景
    妈妈抱儿看安灯，喜在眉头笑在心；
    今夜儿哭怎么办？扭动开关看星星。
    自从修了水电站，千里良田不怕旱；
    带动机器搞生产，碾米磨面不费难；
    笨重劳动大减少，男女老少心喜欢；
    农业副业齐发展，农村面貌大改观。
