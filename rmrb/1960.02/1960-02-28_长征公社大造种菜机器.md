Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 27th: The Changzheng People's Commune in the suburbs of Shanghai, famous for its year-round green vegetables, has created dozens of new tools in its commune-run industry, including vegetable planters, edamame strip planters, high-pressure sprayers, and vine-tying devices for solanaceous vegetables. These new tools have been evaluated at on-site meetings and are being mass-produced. The work of broadcasting vegetable seeds has always been done by experienced old farmers. Now, with vegetable planters, everyone can sow seeds. Pushing this machine, the seeds are sprayed evenly in the field like water from a sprinkler truck, and the machine will automatically rake and flatten it. Using this machine, one person can plant fifteen mu a day, increasing work efficiency by about ten times.

    长征公社大造种菜机器
    据新华社上海27日电　以蔬菜四季常青闻名的上海市郊长征人民公社社办工业，已经创制出蔬菜播种机、毛豆条播机、高压喷雾器、茄果类蔬菜用的扎藤器等等数十种新工具。这些新工具经过现场会议鉴定，正在大量赶制。撒播蔬菜籽的工作，历来都由有经验的老农担任，现在有了蔬菜播种机，人人都可以撒播菜籽了。推着这种机器，种子就像喷水车里的水一样十分均匀地喷撒在田里，机器还会自动把它耙好压平。使用这种机器，一人一天可种十五亩，提高工效十倍左右。
