Xinhua News Agency, Havana, February 15th: Cuban Trade Minister Cepero Bonilla said today that in nearly ten years of trade with the United States, Cuba has incurred a trade deficit of one billion US dollars with the US, but Cuba's relationship with the Soviet Union will not be like this. He said that in the total trade volume with the Soviet Union, Cuba will have a 20% trade surplus with the Soviet Union. Bonilla made the above remarks when refuting the lies fabricated by the US Embassy in Havana regarding the Cuban-Soviet trade agreement. In a statement issued on the 13th, the US Embassy deliberately spread the lie that the sugar purchased by the Soviet Union from Cuba under the new trade agreement would be resold by the Soviet Union. Bonilla said that the agreement clearly stipulates that the Cuban sugar purchased by the Soviet Union will be used for domestic consumption.

    古巴贸易部长发表谈话
    驳斥美国对苏古协定的诽谤
  据新华社哈瓦那15日电　古巴贸易部长塞佩罗·博尼利亚今天说，古巴在同美国近十年的贸易往来中，造成了古巴对美国的十亿美元的逆差，可是古巴同苏联的关系却不会这样。他说，在同苏联的贸易总额中，古巴对苏联将有20％的顺差。博尼利亚是在驳斥美国驻哈瓦那大使馆编造的有关古巴—苏联贸易协定的谎言时发表上述意见的。美国大使馆在13日发表的声明，故意散布所谓苏联根据新的贸易协定向古巴购买的糖将由苏联再转卖出去的谎言。博尼利亚说，协定清楚地规定，苏联购买的古巴糖将用于国内消费。
